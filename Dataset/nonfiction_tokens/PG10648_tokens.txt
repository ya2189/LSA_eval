preface
this
being
the
last
possible
volume
in
the
series
of
beacon
lights
of
history
from
the
pen
of
lord
its
readers
will
be
interested
to
know
that
it
contains
all
the
lectures
that
he
had
completed
although
not
all
that
he
had
projected
for
his
review
of
certain
of
the
chief
men
of
letters
lectures
on
other
topics
were
found
among
his
papers
but
none
that
would
perfectly
fit
into
this
scheme
and
it
was
thought
best
not
to
attempt
any
collection
of
his
material
which
he
himself
had
not
deemed
worthy
or
appropriate
for
use
in
this
series
which
embodies
the
best
of
his
life
work
all
of
his
books
and
his
lectures
that
he
wished
to
have
preserved
for
instance
the
old
roman
world
enlarged
in
scope
and
rewritten
is
included
in
the
volumes
on
old
pagan
civilizations
ancient
achievements
and
imperial
antiquity
much
of
his
modern
europe
reappears
in
great
rulers
modern
european
statesmen
and
european
national
leaders
etc
the
consideration
of
great
writers
was
reserved
by
lord
for
his
final
task
a
task
interrupted
by
death
and
left
unfinished
in
order
to
round
out
and
complete
this
volume
recourse
has
been
had
to
some
other
masters
in
literary
art
whose
productions
are
added
to
final
writings
in
the
present
volume
therefore
are
included
the
paper
on
shakspeare
by
emerson
reprinted
from
his
representative
men
by
permission
of
houghton

brown
the
publishers
of
that
work
and
a
chapter

certain
advantage
may
accrue
to
the
reader
in
finding
these
masters
side
by
side
for
comparison
and
for
gauging

purpose
no

socialism
and
education
two
great
political
writers
in
the
eighteenth
century
of
antagonistic
views
but
both
original
and
earnest
have
materially
affected
the
whole
science
of
government
and
even
of
social
life
from
their
day
to
ours
and
in
their
influence
really
belong
to
the
nineteenth
century
one
was
the
apostle
of
radicalism
the
other
of
conservatism
the
one
more
than
any
other
single
man
stimulated
though
unwittingly
the
french
revolution
the
other
opposed
that
mad
outburst
with
equal
eloquence
and
caused
in
europe
a
reaction
from
revolutionary
principles
while
one
is
far
better
known
than
the
other
to
the
thoughtful
both
are
exponents
and
representatives
of
conflicting
political
and
social
questions
which
agitate
this
age
these
men
were
jean
jacques
rousseau
and
edmund
burke
one
swiss
and
the
other
english
burke
i
have
already
treated
of
in
a
former
volume
his
name
is
no
longer
a
power
but
his
influence
endures
in
all
the
grand
reforms
of
which
he
was
a
part
and
for
which
his
generation
in
england
is
praised
while
his
writings
remain
a
of
political
and
moral
wisdom
sure
to
be
drawn
upon
during
every
public
discussion
of
governmental
principles
rousseau
although
a
writer
of
a
hundred
years
ago
seems
to
me
a
fit
representative
of
political
social
and
educational
ideas
in
the
present
day
because
his
theories
are
still
potent
and
even
in
this
scientific
age
more
widely
diffused
than
ever
before
not
without
reason
it
is
true
for
he
embodied
certain
germinant
ideas
in
a
fascinating
literary
style
but
it
is
hard
to
understand
how
so
weak
a
man
could
have
exercised
such
influence
himself
a
genuine
and
passionate
lover
of
nature
recognizing
in
his
principles
of
conduct
no
duties
that
could
conflict
with
personal
inclinations
born
in
democratic
and
switzerland
and
early
imbued
through
his
reading
of
german
and
english
writers
with
ideas
of
liberty
which
in
those
conservative
lands
were
wholesome
he
distilled
these
ideas
into
charming
literary
creations
that
were
eagerly
read
by
the
restless
minds
of
france
and
wrought
in
them
political
frenzy
the
reforms
he
projected
grew
out
of
his
theories
of
the
rights
of
man
without
reference
to
the
duties
that
limit
those
rights
and
his
appeal
for
their
support
to
men
passions
and
selfish
instincts
and
to
a
sentimental
philosophy
in
an
age
of
irreligion
and
immorality
aroused
a
political
tempest
which
he
little
contemplated
in
an
age
so
infidel
and
brilliant
as
that
which
preceded
the
french
revolution
the
writings
of
rousseau
had
a
peculiar
charm
and
produced
a
great
effect
even
on
men
who
despised
his
character
and
ignored
his
mission
he
engendered
the
robespierres
and
condorcets
of
the
revolution
those
sentimental
murderers
who
under
the
guise
of
philosophy
attacked
the
fundamental
principles
of
justice
and
destroyed
the
very
rights
which
they
invoked
jean
jacques
rousseau
was
born
at
geneva
in
the
year
when
voltaire
was
first
rising
into
notice
he
belonged
to
the
plebeian
ranks
being
the
son
of
a
watchmaker
was
sickly
miserable
and
morbid
from
a
child
was
poorly
educated
but
a
great
devourer
of
novels
which
his
father
sentimental
as
he
read
with
him
poetry
and
gushing
biographies
although
a
little
later
he
became
with
impartial
facility
equally
delighted
with
the
sturdy
plutarch
his
nature
was
passionate
and
inconstant
his
sensibilities
morbidly
acute
and
his
imagination
lively
he
hated
all
rules
precedents
and
authority
he
was
lazy
listless
deceitful
and
had
a
great
craving
for
novelties
and
excitement
as
he
himself
says
feeling
everything
and
knowing
nothing
at
an
early
age
without
money
or
friends
he
ran
away
from
the
engraver
to
whom
he
had
been
apprenticed
and
after
various
adventures
was
first
kindly
received
by
a
catholic
priest
in
savoy
then
by
a
generous
and
erring
woman
of
wealth
lately
converted
to
catholicism
and
again
by
the
priests
of
a
catholic
seminary
in
sardinia
under
whose
tuition
and
in
order
to
advance
his
personal
fortunes
he
abjured
the
religion
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
and
professed
catholicism
this
however
cost
him
no
conscientious
scruples
for
his
religious
training
had
been
of
the
slimmest
and
principles
he
had
none
we
next
see
rousseau
as
a
footman
in
the
service
of
an
italian
countess
where
he
was
mean
enough
to
accuse
a
servant
girl
of
a
theft
he
had
himself
committed
thereby
causing
her
ruin
again
employed
as
a
footman
in
the
service
of
another
noble
family
his
extraordinary
talents
were
detected
and
he
was
made
secretary
but
all
this
kindness
he
returned
with
insolence
and
again
became
a
wanderer
in
his
isolation
he
sought
the
protection
of
the
swiss
lady
who
had
before
befriended
him
madame
de
warens
he
began
as
her
secretary
and
ended
in
becoming
her
lover
in
her
house
he
saw
society
and
learned
music
a
fit
of
caprice
induced
rousseau
to
throw
up
this
situation
and
he
then
taught
music
in
chambéry
for
a
living
studied
hard
read
voltaire
descartes
locke
hobbes
leibnitz
and
puffendorf
and
evinced
an
uncommon
vivacity
and
talent
for
conversation
which
made
him
a
favorite
in
social
circles
his
chief
labor
however
for
five
years
was
in
inventing
a
system
of
musical
notation
which
led
him
to
lyons
and
then
in
to
paris
he
was
now
years
old
a
visionary
man
full
of
schemes
with
crude
opinions
and
unbounded
but
poor
and
unknown
a
true
adventurer
with
many
agreeable
qualities
irregular
habits
and
not
very
scrupulous
morals
favored
by
letters
of
introduction
to
ladies
of
distinction
for
he
was
a
favorite
with
ladies
who
liked
his
enthusiasm
freshness
elegant
talk
and
grand
sentiments
he
succeeded
in
getting
his
system
of
musical
notation
examined
although
not
accepted
by
the
french
academy
and
secured
an
appointment
as
secretary
in
the
suite
of
the
ambassador
to
venice
in
this
city
rousseau
remained
but
a
short
time
being
disgusted
with
what
he
called
official
insolence
which
did
not
properly
recognize
native
genius
he
returned
to
paris
as
poor
as
when
he
left
it
and
lived
in
a
cheap
restaurant
there
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
thérèse
a
healthy
amiable
woman
but
low
illiterate
unappreciative
and
coarse
the
author
of
many
of
his
subsequent
miseries
she
lived
with
him
till
he
died
at
first
as
his
mistress
and
housekeeper
although
later
in
life
he
married
her
she
was
the
mother
of
his
five
children
every
one
of
whom
he
sent
to
a
foundling
hospital
justifying
his
inhumanity
by
those
sophistries
and
paradoxes
with
which
his
writings
abound
even
in
one
of
his
letters
appealing
for
pity
because
he
had
never
known
the
sweetness
of
a
father
embrace
with
extraordinary
too
he
looked
upon
himself
all
the
while
in
his
numerous
illicit
loves
as
a
paragon
of
virtue
being
apparently
without
any
moral
sense
or
perception
of
moral
distinctions
it
was
not
till
rousseau
was
years
of
age
that
he
attracted
public
attention
by
his
writings
although
earlier
known
in
literary
circles
especially
in
that
infidel
parisian
where
diderot
grimm
david
hume
the
marquis
de
mirabeau
helvetius
and
other
wits
shined
in
which
circle
no
genius
was
acknowledged
and
no
profundity
of
thought
was
deemed
possible
unless
allied
with
those
pagan
ideas
which
saint
augustine
had
exploded
and
pascal
had
ridiculed
even
while
living
among
these
people
rousseau
had
all
the
while
a
kind
of
sentimental
religiosity
which
revolted
at
their
ribald
scoffing
although
he
never
protested
he
had
written
some
fugitive
pieces
of
music
and
had
attempted
and
failed
in
several
slight
operettas
composing
both
music
and
words
but
the
work
which
made
rousseau
famous
was
his
essay
on
a
subject
propounded
in
by
the
academy
of
dijon
has
the
progress
of
science
and
the
arts
contributed
to
corrupt
or
to
purify
morals
this
was
a
strange
subject
for
a
literary
institution
to
propound
but
one
which
exactly
fitted
the
genius
of
rousseau
the
boldness
of
his
paradox
for
he
maintained
the
evil
effects
of
science
and
art
and
the
brilliancy
of
his
style
secured
readers
although
the
essay
was
crude
in
argument
and
false
in
logic
in
his
confessions
he
himself
condemns
it
as
the
weakest
of
all
his
works
although
full
of
force
and
fire
and
he
adds
with
whatever
talent
a
man
may
be
born
the
art
of
writing
is
not
easily
learned
it
has
been
said
that
rousseau
got
the
idea
of
taking
the
off
side
of
this
question
from
his
literary
friend
diderot
and
that
his
unexpected
success
with
it
was
the
secret
of
his
career
of
opposition
to
all
established
institutions
this
is
interesting
but
not
very
authentic
the
next
year
his
irregular
activity
having
been
again
stimulated
by
learning
that
his
essay
had
gained
the
premium
at
dijon
and
by
the
fact
of
its
great
vogue
as
a
published
pamphlet
another
performance
fairly
raised
rousseau
to
the
pinnacle
of
fashion
and
this
was
an
opera
which
he
composed
le
devin
du
village
the
village
sorcerer
which
was
performed
at
fontainebleau
before
the
court
and
received
with
unexampled
enthusiasm
his
profession
so
far
as
he
had
any
was
that
of
a
copyist
of
music
and
his
musical
taste
and
facile
talents
had
at
last
brought
him
an
uncritical
recognition
but
rousseau
soon
abandoned
music
for
literature
in
he
wrote
another
essay
for
the
academy
of
dijon
on
the
origin
of
the
inequality
of
man
full
of
still
more
startling
paradoxes
than
his
first
in
which
he
attempted
to
show
with
great
felicity
of
language
the
superiority
of
savage
life
over
civilization
at
the
age
of
rousseau
revisited
protestant
geneva
abjured
in
its
turn
the
catholic
faith
and
was
offered
the
post
of
librarian
of
the
city
but
he
could
not
live
out
of
the
atmosphere
of
paris
nor
did
he
wish
to
remain
under
the
shadow
of
voltaire
living
in
his
villa
near
the
city
gate
of
geneva
who
had
but
little
admiration
for
rousseau
and
whose
superior
social
position
excited
the
latter
envy
yet
he
professed
to
hate
paris
with
its
conventionalities
and
fashions
and
sought
a
quiet
retreat
where
he
could
more
leisurely
pursue
his
studies
and
enjoy
nature
which
he
really
loved
this
was
provided
for
him
by
an
enthusiastic
friend
madame
in
the
beautiful
valley
of
montmorenci
and
called
the
hermitage
situated
in
the
grounds
of
her
château
de
la
chevrette
here
he
lived
with
his
wife
and
he
himself
enjoying
the
hospitalities
of
the
château
besides
society
of
a
most
cultivated
kind
also
woods
lawns
parks
gardens
all
for
nothing
the
luxuries
of
civilization
the
glories
of
nature
and
the
delights
of
friendship
combined
it
was
an
earthly
paradise
given
him
by
enthusiastic
admirers
of
his
genius
and
conversation
in
this
retreat
one
of
the
most
favored
which
a
poor
author
ever
had
rousseau
ever
craving
some
outlet
for
his
passionate
sentiments
created
an
ideal
object
of
love
he
wrote
imaginary
letters
dwelling
with
equal
rapture
on
those
he
wrote
and
those
he
fancied
he
received
in
return
and
which
he
read
to
his
lady
friends
after
his
rambles
in
the
forests
and
parks
during
their
reunions
at
the
thus
was
born
the
nouvelle
héloïse
a
novel
of
immense
fame
in
which
the
characters
are
invested
with
every
earthly
attraction
living
in
voluptuous
peace
yet
giving
vent
to
those
passions
which
consume
the
unsatisfied
soul
it
was
the
forerunner
of
corinne
the
sorrows
of
werther
thaddeus
of
warsaw
and
all
those
sentimental
romances
which
amused
our
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
but
which
increased
the
prejudice
of
religious
people
against
novels
it
was
not
until
sir
walter
scott
arose
with
his
wholesome
manliness
that
the
embargo
against
novels
was
removed
the
life
which
rousseau
lived
at
the
hermitage
reveries
in
the
forest
luxurious
dinners
and
sentimental
friendships
led
to
a
passionate
with
the
comtesse
a
of
his
patroness
madame
a
woman
not
only
married
but
who
had
another
lover
besides
the
result
of
course
was
miserable
jealousies
piques
humiliations
misunderstandings
and
the
sundering
of
the
ties
of
friendship
which
led
to
the
necessity
of
another
retreat
a
real
home
the
wretched
man
never
had
this
was
furnished
still
in
the
vicinity
of
montmorenci
by
another
aristocratic
friend
the
maréchal
de
luxembourg
the
fiscal
agent
of
the
prince
de
condé
and
nothing
to
me
is
stranger
than
that
this
wandering
morbid
irritable
man
without
birth
or
fortune
the
father
of
the
wildest
revolutionary
and
democratic
doctrines
and
always
hated
both
by
the
court
and
the
church
should
have
found
his
friends
and
warmest
admirers
and
patrons
in
the
highest
circles
of
social
life
it
can
be
explained
only
by
the
singular
fascination
of
his
eloquence
and
by
the
extreme
stolidity
of
his
worshippers
in
appreciating
his
doctrines
and
the
state
of
society
to
which
his
principles
logically
led
in
this
second
retreat
rousseau
had
the
to
the
palace
of
the
duke
of
luxembourg
where
he
read
to
the
friends
assembled
at
its
banquets
his
new
production
émile
a
singular
treatise
on
education
not
so
faulty
as
his
previous
works
but
still
false
in
many
of
its
principles
especially
in
regard
to
religion
this
book
contained
an
admirable
and
powerful
impulse
away
from
artificiality
and
towards
naturalness
in
education
which
has
exerted
an
immense
influence
for
good
we
shall
revert
to
it
later
a
few
months
before
the
publication
of
émile
rousseau
had
issued
the
social
contract
the
most
revolutionary
of
all
his
works
subversive
of
all
precedents
in
politics
government
and
the
organization
of
society
while
also
confounding
christianity
with
ecclesiasticism
and
attacking
its
influence
in
the
social
order
all
his
works
obtained
a
wide
fame
before
publication
by
reason
of
his
habit
of
reading
them
to
enthusiastic
and
influential
friends
who
made
them
known
the
social
contract
however
dangerous
as
it
was
did
not
when
published
arouse
so
much
opposition
as
émile
the
latter
book
as
we
now
see
contained
much
that
was
admirable
but
its
freedom
and
looseness
in
religious
discussion
called
down
the
wrath
of
the
clergy
excited
the
alarm
of
the
government
and
finally
compelled
the
author
to
fly
for
his
life
to
switzerland
rousseau
is
now
regarded
as
an
enemy
to
christian
doctrine
even
as
he
was
a
foe
to
the
existing
institutions
of
society
in
geneva
his
books
are
publicly
burned
henceforth
his
life
is
embittered
by
constant
persecution
he
flies
from
canton
to
canton
in
the
freest
country
in
europe
obnoxious
not
only
for
his
opinions
but
for
his
habits
of
life
he
affectedly
adopts
the
armenian
dress
with
its
big
fur
bonnet
and
long
girdled
caftan
among
the
swiss
peasantry
he
is
as
full
of
personal
eccentricities
as
he
is
of
intellectual
crotchets
he
becomes
a
sort
of
literary
vagabond
with
every
man
hand
against
him
he
now
writes
a
series
of
essays
called
letters
from
the
mountain
full
of
bitterness
and
sentiments
so
incensed
by
these
writings
are
the
country
people
among
whom
he
dwells
that
he
is
again
forced
to
fly
david
hume
regarding
him
as
a
mild
affectionate
and
persecuted
man
gives
rousseau
a
shelter
in
england
the
wretched
man
retires
to
derbyshire
and
there
writes
his
confessions
the
most
interesting
and
most
dangerous
of
his
books
showing
a
diseased
and
irritable
mind
and
most
sophistical
views
on
the
immutable
principles
of
both
morality
and
religion
a
victim
of
mistrust
and
jealousy
he
quarrels
with
hume
who
learns
to
despise
his
character
while
pitying
the
sensitive
sufferings
of
one
whom
he
calls
a
man
born
without
a
skin
rousseau
returns
to
france
at
the
age
of
after
various
wanderings
he
is
permitted
to
settle
in
paris
where
he
lives
with
great
frugality
in
a
single
room
poorly
furnished
supporting
himself
by
again
copying
music
sought
still
in
high
society
yet
shy
reserved
forlorn
bitter
occasionally
making
new
friends
who
are
attracted
by
the
infantine
simplicity
of
his
manners
and
apparent
amiability
but
losing
them
almost
as
soon
as
made
by
his
petty
jealousies
and
irritability
being
equally
indignant
at
neglect
and
intolerant
of
attention
rousseau
declining
health
and
the
fear
of
his
friends
that
he
was
on
the
borders
of
insanity
led
to
his
last
retreat
offered
by
a
munificent
friend
at
ermenonville
near
paris
where
he
died
at
years
of
age
in
as
some
think
from
poison
administered
by
his
own
hand
the
revolutionary
national
assembly
of
france
in
bestowed
a
pension
of
fifteen
hundred
francs
on
his
worthless
widow
who
had
married
a
soon
after
the
death
of
her
husband
such
was
the
checkered
life
of
rousseau
as
to
his
character
lord
brougham
says
that
never
was
so
much
genius
before
united
with
so
much
weakness
the
leading
spring
of
his
life
was
egotism
he
never
felt
himself
wrong
and
the
sophistries
he
used
to
justify
his
immoralities
are
both
ludicrous
and
pitiable
his
treatment
of
madame
de
warens
his
first
benefactor
was
heartless
while
the
abandonment
of
his
children
was
infamous
he
twice
changed
his
religion
without
convictions
for
the
advancement
of
his
fortunes
he
pretended
to
be
poor
when
he
was
independent
in
his
circumstances
he
supposed
himself
to
be
without
vanity
while
he
was
notoriously
the
most
conceited
man
in
france
he
quarrelled
with
all
his
friends
he
made
war
on
society
itself
he
declared
himself
a
believer
in
christianity
but
denied
all
revelation
all
miracles
all
inspiration
all
supernaturalism
and
everything
he
could
not
reconcile
with
his
reason
his
bitterest
enemies
were
the
atheists
themselves
who
regarded
him
as
a
hypocrite
since
he
professed
to
believe
in
what
he
undermined
the
hostility
of
the
church
was
excited
against
him
not
because
he
directly
assailed
christianity
but
because
he
denied
all
its
declarations
and
sapped
its
authority
rousseau
was
however
a
sentimentalist
rather
than
a
rationalist
an
artist
rather
than
a
philosopher
he
was
not
a
learned
man
but
a
bold
thinker
he
would
root
out
all
distinctions
in
society
because
they
could
not
be
reconciled
with
his
sense
of
justice
he
preached
a
gospel
of
human
rights
based
not
on
christianity
but
on
instinct
he
was
full
of
impracticable
theories
he
would
have
no
war
no
suffering
no
hardship
no
bondage
no
fear
and
even
no
labor
since
these
were
evils
and
according
to
his
notions
of
moral
government
unnecessary
but
in
all
his
grand
theories
he
ignored
the
settled
laws
of
providence
even
those
of
that
nature
he
so
fervently
worshipped
all
that
is
decreed
concerning
man
or
woman
all
that
is
stern
and
real
in
existence
and
while
he
uttered
such
sophistries
he
excited
discontent
with
the
inevitable
condition
of
man
he
loosened
family
ties
he
relaxed
wholesome
restraints
he
infused
an
intense
hatred
of
all
conditions
subject
to
necessary
toil
the
life
of
this
embittered
philanthropist
was
as
great
a
contradiction
as
were
his
writings
this
benevolent
man
sends
his
own
children
to
a
foundling
hospital
this
independent
man
lives
for
years
on
the
bounty
of
an
erring
woman
whom
at
last
he
exposes
and
deserts
this
idealizer
of
friendship
quarrels
with
every
man
who
seeks
to
extricate
him
from
the
consequences
of
his
own
imprudence
this
affectionate
lover
refuses
a
seat
at
his
table
to
the
woman
with
whom
he
lives
and
who
is
the
mother
of
his
children
this
proud
republican
accepts
a
pension
from
king
george
and
lives
in
the
houses
of
aristocratic

without

this
religious
teacher
rarely
goes
to
church
or
respects
the
outward
observances
of
the
christianity
he
affects
this
moral
theorizer
on
his
own
confession
steals
and
lies
and
cheats
this
modest
innocent
corrupts
almost
every
woman

this

consumes
his

and
senseless

this
patriot
makes

on

and
even
of

this
humble
man
turns
his
back
on
every
one
who
will
not
do
him
reverence
such
was
this
precursor
of
revolutions
this
agitator
this
hypocrite
this
egotist
this
lying
prophet
a
man
admired
and
despised
brilliant
but
indefinite
original
but
not
true
acute
but
not
wise
logical
but
reasoning
on
false
premises
advancing
some
great
truths
but
spoiling
their
legitimate
effect
by
sophistries
and
falsehoods
why
then
discuss
the
ideas
and
influence
of
so
despicable
a
creature
because
sophistical
as
they
were
those
ideas
contained
truths
of
tremendous
germinant
power
because
in
the
rank
soil
of
his
times
they
produced
a
vast
crop
of
bitter
poisonous
fruit
while
in
the
more
open
better
aërated
soil
of
this
century
they
have
borne
and
have
yet
to
bear
a
fruitage
of
universal
benefit
god
ways
seem
mysterious
it
is
for
men
patiently
to
study
understand
and
utilize
them
let
us
turn
to
the
more
definite
consideration
of
the
writings
which
have
given
this
author
so
brilliant
a
fame
i
omit
any
review
of
his
operas
and
his
system
of
musical
notation
as
not
bearing
on
the
opinions
of
society
the
first
work
as
i
have
said
which
brought
rousseau
into
notice
was
the
treatise
for
the
academy
of
dijon
as
to
whether
the
arts
and
sciences
have
contributed
to
corrupt
or
to
purify
morals
rousseau
followed
the
bent
of
his
genius
in
maintaining
that
they
have
done
more
harm
than
good
and
he
was
so
fresh
and
original
and
brilliant
that
he
gained
the
prize
this
little
work
contains
the
germ
of
all
his
subsequent
theories
especially
that
in
which
he
magnifies
the
state
of
nature
over
civilization
an
amazing
paradox
which
however
appealed
to
society
when
men
were
wearied
with
the
very
pleasures
for
which
they
lived
rousseau
cant
about
the
virtues
engendered
by
ignorance
idleness
and
barbarism
is
repulsive
to
every
sound
mind
civilization
may
present
greater
temptations
than
a
state
of
nature
but
these
are
inseparable
from
any
growth
and
can
be
overcome
by
the
valorous
mind
who
but
a
madman
would
sweep
away
civilization
with
its
factitious
and
remediable
evils
for
barbarism
with
its
untutored
impulses
and
animal
life
here
rousseau
makes
war
upon
society
upon
all
that
is
glorious
in
the
advance
of
intellect
and
the
growth
of
morality
upon
the
reason
and
aspirations
of
mankind
can
inexperience
be
a
better
guide
than
experience
when
it
encounters
crime
and
folly
yet
on
the
other
hand
a
plea
for
greater
simplicity
of
life
a
larger
study
of
nature
and
a
freer
enjoyment
of
its
refreshing
contrasts
to
the
life
of
cities
is
one
of
the
most
reasonable
and
healthful
impulses
of
our
own
day
what
can
be
more
absurd
although
bold
and
striking
than
essay
on
the
origin
of
human
inequalities
in
this
he
pushes
out
the
doctrine
of
personal
liberty
to
its
utmost
logical
sequence
so
as
to
do
away
with
government
itself
and
with
all
regulation
for
the
common
good
we
do
not
quarrel
with
his
abstract
propositions
in
respect
to
political
equality
but
his
deductions
strike
a
blow
at
civilization
since
he
maintains
that
inequalities
of
human
condition
are
the
source
of
all
political
and
social
evils
while
christianity
confirmed
by
teaches
that
the
source
of
social
evils
is
in
the
selfish
nature
of
man
rather
than
in
his
outward
condition
and
further
if
it
were
possible
to
destroy
the
inequalities
of
life
they
would
soon
again
return
even
with
the
most
boundless
liberty
here
is
sacrificed
to
a
captivating
theory
and
all
the
experiences
of
the
world
are
ignored
this
shows
the
folly
of
projecting
any
abstract
theory
however
true
to
its
remote
and
logical
sequence
in
the
attempt
we
are
almost
certain
to
be
landed
in
absurdity
so
complicated
are
the
relations
of
life
especially
in
governmental
and
political
science
what
doctrine
of
civil
or
political
economy
would
be
applicable
in
all
ages
and
all
countries
and
all
conditions
like
the
ascertained
laws
of
science
or
the
great
and
accepted
truths
of
the
bible
political
axioms
are
to
be
considered
in
their
relation
with
other
truths
equally
accepted
or
men
are
soon
brought
into
a
labyrinth
of
difficulties
and
the
strongest
intellect
is
perplexed
and
especially
will
this
be
the
case
when
a
theory
under
consideration
is
not
a
truth
but
an
assumption
that
was
the
trouble
with
rousseau
his
theories
disdainful
of
experience
however
logically
treated
became
in
their
remotest
sequence
and
application
insulting
to
the
human
understanding
because
they
were
often
not
only
assumptions
but
assumptions
of
what
was
not
true
although
very
specious
and
flattering
to
certain
classes
rousseau
confounded
the
great
truth
of
the
justice
of
moral
and
political
equality
with
the
absurd
and
unnatural
demand
for
social
and
material
equality
the
great
modern
cry
for
equal
opportunity
for
all
is
sound
and
christian
but
any
attempt
to
guarantee
individual
success
in
using
opportunity
to
insure
the
lame
and
the
lazy
an
equal
rank
in
the
race
must
end
in
confusion
and
distraction
the
evil
of
rousseau
crude
theories
or
false
assumptions
was
practically
seen
in
the
acceptance
of
their
logical
conclusions
which
led
to
anarchy
murder
pillage
and
outrageous
excess
the
great
danger
attending
his
theories
is
that
they
are
generally
truth
and
falsehood
blended
his
writings
are
sophistical
it
is
difficult
to
separate
the
truth
from
the
error
by
reason
of
the
marvellous
felicity
of
his
language
i
do
not
underrate
his
genius
or
his
style
he
was
doubtless
an
original
thinker
and
a
most
brilliant
and
artistic
writer
and
by
so
much
did
he
confuse
people
even
by
the
speciousness
of
his
logic
there
is
nothing
indefinite
in
what
he
advances
he
is
not
a
poet
dealing
in
mysticisms
but
a
rhetorical
philosopher
propounding
startling
theories
partly
true
and
partly
false
which
he
logically
enforces
with
matchless
eloquence
probably
the
most
influential
of
rousseau
writings
was
the
social
contract
the
great
textbook
of
the
revolution
in
this
famous
treatise
he
advanced
some
important
ideas
which
undoubtedly
are
based
on
ultimate
truth
such
as
that
the
people
are
the
source
of
power
that
might
does
not
make
right
that
slavery
is
an
aggression
on
human
rights
but
with
these
ideal
truths
he
combines
the
assertion
that
government
is
a
contract
between
the
governor
and
the
governed
in
a
perfect
state
of
society
this
may
be
the
ideal
but
society
is
not
and
never
has
been
perfect
and
certainly
in
all
the
early
ages
of
the
world
governments
were
imposed
upon
people
by
the
strong
hand
irrespective
of
their
will
and
wishes
and
these
were
the
only
governments
which
were
fit
and
useful
in
that
elder
day
governments
as
a
plain
matter
of
fact
have
generally
arisen
from
circumstances
and
relations
with
which
the
people
have
had
little
to
do
the
oriental
monarchies
were
the
gradual
outgrowth
of
patriarchal
tradition
and
successful
military
leadership
and
in
regard
to
them
the
people
were
never
consulted
at
all
the
roman
empire
was
ruled
without
the
consent
of
the
governed
feudal
monarchies
in
europe
were
based
on
the
divine
rights
of
kings
there
was
no
state
in
europe
where
a
compact
or
social
contract
had
been
made
or
implied
even
later
when
the
french
elected
napoleon
they
chose
a
monarch
because
they
feared
anarchy
without
making
any
stipulation
there
were
no
contracting
parties
the
error
of
rousseau
was
in
assuming
a
social
contract
as
a
fact
and
then
reasoning
upon
the
assumption
his
premises
are
wrong
or
at
least
they
are
nothing
more
than
statements
of
what
abstractly
might
be
made
to
follow
from
the
assumption
that
the
people
actually
are
the
source
of
power
a
condition
most
desirable
and
in
the
last
analysis
correct
since
even
military
despots
use
the
power
of
the
people
in
order
to
oppress
the
people
but
which
is
practically
true
only
in
certain
states
yet
after
all
when
brought
under
the
domain
of
law
by
the
sturdy
sense
and
utilitarian
sagacity
of
the
race
rousseau
doctrine
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
is
the
great
political
motor
of
this
century
in
republics
and
monarchies
alike
again
rousseau
maintains
that
whatever
acquisitions
an
individual
or
a
society
may
make
the
right
to
this
property
must
be
always
subordinate
to
the
right
which
the
community
at
large
has
over
the
possessions
of
all
here
is
the
germ
of
much
of
our
socialism
whatever
element
of
truth
there
may
be
in
the
theory
that
would
regard
land
and
capital
the
means
of
production
as
the
joint
possession
of
all
the
members
of
the
community
the
basic
doctrine
of
socialism
any
forcible
attempt
to
distribute
present
results
of
individual
production
and
accumulation
would
be
unjust
and
dangerous
to
the
last
degree
in
the
case
of
the
furious
carrying
out
of
this
doctrine
by
the
crazed
french
revolutionists
it
led
to
outrageous
confiscation
on
the
ground
that
all
property
belonged
to
the
state
and
therefore
the
representatives
of
the
nation
could
do
what
they
pleased
with
it
this
shallow
sophistry
was
accepted
by
the
french
national
convention
when
it
swept
away
estates
of
nobles
and
clergy
not
on
the
tenable
ground
that
the
owners
were
public
enemies
but
on
the
baseless
pretext
that
their
property
belonged
to
the
nation
from
this
sophistry
about
the
rights
of
property
rousseau
advanced
another
of
still
worse
tendency
which
was
that
the
general
will
is
always
in
the
right
and
constantly
tends
to
the
public
good
the
theory
is
inconsistent
with
itself
light
and
truth
do
not
come
from
the
universal
reason
but
from
the
thoughts
of
great
men
stimulated
into
growth
among
the
people
the
teachers
of
the
world
belong
to
a
small
class
society
is
in
need
of
constant
reforms
which
are
not
suggested
by
the
mass
but
by
a
few
philosophers
or
reformers
the
wise
men
who
save
cities
rousseau
further
says
that
a
whole
people
can
never
become
corrupted
a
most
barefaced
assertion
have
not
all
nations
suffered
periods
of
corruption
this
notion
that
the
whole
people
can
not
err
opens
the
door
for
any
license
it
logically
leads
to
that
other
idea
of
the
native
majesty
of
man
and
the
perfectibility
of
society
which
this
sophist
boldly
accepted
rousseau
thought
that
if
society
were
released
from
all
law
and
all
restraint
the
good
impulses
and
good
sense
of
the
majority
would
produce
a
higher
state
of
virtue
and
wisdom
than
what
he
saw
around
him
since
majorities
could
do
no
wrong
and
the
universal
reason
could
not
err
in
this
absurdity
lay
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
french
revolution
so
far
as
it
was
produced
by
the
writings
of
philosophers
this
doctrine
was
eagerly
seized
upon
by
the
french
people
maddened
by
generations
of
oppression
poverty
and
degradation
because
it
appealed
to
the
pride
and
vanity
of
the
masses
at
that
time
congregated
bodies
of
ignorance
and
wickedness
rousseau
had
an
unbounded
trust
in
human
nature
that
it
is
good
and
wise
and
will
do
the
best
thing
if
left
to
itself
but
can
anything
be
more
antagonistic
to
all
the
history
of
the
race
i
doubt
if
rousseau
had
any
profound
knowledge
or
even
really
extensive
reading
he
was
a
dreamer
a
theorist
a
sentimentalist
he
was
the
of
all
sensationalism
in
the
guise
of
logic
what
more
acceptable
to
the
vile
people
of
his
age
than
the
theory
that
in
their
collective
capacity
they
could
not
err
that
the
universal
reason
was
divine
what
more
logical
than
its
culmination
in
that
outrageous
indecency
the
worship
of
reason
in
the
person
of
a
prostitute
again
rousseau
notion
of
the
limitations
of
law
and
the
prerogative
of
the
people
carried
out
would
lead
to
the
utter
subversion
of
central
authority
and
reduce
nations
to
an
absolute
democracy
of
small
communities
they
would
divide
and
subdivide
until
society
was
resolved
into
its
original
elements
this
idea
existed
among
the
early
greek
states
when
a
state
rarely
comprised
more
than
a
single
city
or
town
or
village
such
as
might
be
found
among
the
tribes
of
north
american
indians
the
great
political
question
in
ancient
greece
was
the
autonomy
of
cities
which
kept
the
whole
land
in
constant
wars
and
dissensions
and
quarrels
and
jealousies
and
prevented
that
centralization
of
power
which
would
have
made
greece
unconquerable
and
the
mistress
of
the
world
our
wholesome
american
system
of
autonomy
in
local
affairs
with
a
common
authority
in
matters
affecting
the
general
good
is
organized
liberty
but
the
ancient
and
outgrown
idea
of
unregulated
autonomy
was
revived
by
rousseau
and
though
it
could
not
be
carried
out
by
the
french
revolutionists
who
accepted
nearly
all
his
theories
it
led
to
the
disintegration
of
france
and
the
multiplication
of
offices
fatal
to
a
healthy
central
power
napoleon
broke
up
all
this
in
his
centralized
despotism
even
if
to
keep
the
revolutionary
sympathy
he
retained
the
departments
which
were
substituted
for
the
ancient
provinces
the
extreme
spirit
of
democratic
liberty
which
is
the
characteristic
of
rousseau
political
philosophy
led
to
the
advocacy
of
the
wildest
doctrines
of
equality
he
would
prevent
the
accumulation
of
wealth
so
that
to
use
his
words
no
one
citizen
should
be
rich
enough
to
buy
another
and
no
one
so
poor
as
to
be
obliged
to
sell
himself
he
would
have
neither
rich
people
nor
beggars
what
could
flow
from
such
doctrines
but
discontent
and
unreasonable
expectations
among
the
poor
and
a
general
fear
and
sense
of
insecurity
among
the
rich
this
state
of
nature
moreover
in
his
view
could
be
reached
only
by
going
backward
and
destroying
all
civilization
and
it
was
civilization
which
he
ever
decried
a
very
pleasant
doctrine
to
vagabonds
but
likely
to
be
treated
with
derisive
mockery
by
all
those
who
have
something
to
conserve
another
and
most
dangerous
principle
which
was
advocated
in
the
social
contract
was
that
religion
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
affairs
of
civil
and
political
life
that
religious
obligations
do
not
bind
a
citizen
that
christianity
in
fact
ignores
all
the
great
relations
of
man
in
society
this
is
distinct
from
the
puritan
doctrine
of
the
separation
of
the
church
from
the
state
by
which
is
simply
meant
that
priests
ought
not
to
interfere
in
matters
purely
political
nor
the
government
meddle
with
religious
affairs
a
prime
doctrine
in
a
free
state
but
no
body
of
men
were
ever
more
ardent
defenders
of
the
doctrine
that
all
religious
ideas
ought
to
bear
on
the
social
and
political
fabric
than
the
puritans
they
would
break
up
slavery
if
it
derogated
from
the
doctrine
of
the
common
brotherhood
of
man
as
declared
by
christ
they
would
use
their
influence
as
christians
to
root
out
all
evil
institutions
and
laws
and
bring
the
sublime
truths
of
the
master
to
bear
on
all
the
relations
of
life
on
citizens
at
the
at
the
helm
of
power
and
in
legislative
bodies
christianity
was
to
them
the
supreme
law
with
which
all
human
laws
must
harmonize
but
rousseau
would
throw
out
christianity
altogether
as
foreign
to
the
duties
and
relations
of
both
citizens
and
rulers
pretending
that
it
ignored
all
connection
with
mundane
affairs
and
had
reference
only
to
the
salvation
of
the
soul
as
if
all
christ
teachings
were
not
regulative
of
the
springs
of
conduct
between
man
and
man
as
indicative
of
the
relations
between
man
and
god
like
voltaire
rousseau
had
the
excuse
of
a
corrupt
ecclesiasticism
to
be
broken
into
but
the
church
and
christianity
are
two
different
things
this
he
did
not
see
no
one
was
more
impatient
of
all
restraints
than
rousseau
yet
he
maintained
that
men
if
calling
themselves
christians
must
submit
to
every
wrong
and
injustice
looking
for
a
remedy
in
the
future
world
thus
pouring
contempt
on
those
who
had
no
right
according
to
his
view
of
their
system
to
complain
of
injustice
or
strive
to
rise
above
temporal
evils
christianity
he
said
inculcates
servitude
and
dependence
its
spirit
is
favorable
to
tyrants
true
christians
are
formed
to
be
slaves
and
they
know
it
and
never
trouble
themselves
about
conspiracies
and
insurrections
since
this
transitory
world
has
no
value
in
their
eyes
he
denied
that
christians
could
be
good
soldiers
a
falsehood
rebuked
for
us
by
the
wars
of
the
reformation
by
the
troops
of
cromwell
and
gustavus
adolphus
by
our
american
soldiers
in
the
late
civil
war
thus
he
would
throw
away
the
greatest
stimulus
to
heroism
even
the
consciousness
of
duty
and
devotion
to
great
truths
and
interests
i
can
not
follow
out
the
political
ideas
of
rousseau
in
his
various
other
treatises
in
which
he
prepared
the
way
for
revolution
and
for
the
excesses
of
the
reign
of
terror
the
truth
is
rousseau
feelings
were
vastly
superior
to
his
thinking
whatever
of
good
is
to
result
from
his
influence
will
arise
out
of
the
impulse
he
gave
toward
the
search
for
ideals
that
should
embrace
the
many
as
well
as
the
few
in
their
benefits
when
he
himself
attempted
to
apply
this
impulse
to
philosophic
political
thought
his
unregulated
mind
went
all
astray
let
us
now
turn
to
consider
a
moment
his
doctrines
pertaining
to
education
as
brought
out
in
his
greatest
and
most
unexceptionable
work
his
émile
in
this
remarkable
book
everything
pertaining
to
human
life
appears
to
be
discussed
the
duties
of
parents
punishments
perception
and
the
beginning
of
thinking
toys
games
catechisms
all
passions
and
sentiments
religion
friendship
love
jealousy
pity
the
means
of
happiness
the
pleasures
and
profits
of
travel
the
principles
of
virtue
of
justice
and
liberty
language
books
the
nature
of
man
and
of
woman
the
arts
of
conventional
life
politeness
riches
poverty
society
marriage
on
all
these
and
other
questions
he
discourses
with
great
sagacity
and
good
sense
and
with
unrivalled
beauty
of
expression
often
rising
to
great
eloquence
never
dull
or
uninstructive
aiming
to
present
virtue
and
vice
in
their
true
colors
inspiring
exalted
sentiments
and
presenting
happiness
in
simple
pleasures
and
natural
life
this
treatise
is
both
full
and
original
the
author
supposes
an
imaginary
pupil
named
émile
and
he
himself
intrusted
with
the
care
of
the
boy
education
attends
him
from
his
cradle
to
his
manhood
assists
him
with
the
necessary
directions
for
his
general
improvement
and
finally
introduces
him
to
an
amiable
and
unsophisticated
girl
whose
love
he
wins
by
his
virtues
and
whom
he
honorably
marries
so
that
although
a
treatise
the
work
is
invested
with
the
fascination
of
a
novel
in
reading
this
book
which
made
so
great
a
noise
in
europe
with
so
much
that
is
admirable
i
find
but
little
to
criticise
except
three
things
which
mar
its
beauty
and
make
it
both
dangerous
and
false
in
which
the
unsoundness
of
rousseau
mind
and
character
the
strange
paradoxes
of
his
life
in
mixing
up
good
with
evil
are
brought
out
and
that
so
forcibly
that
the
author
was
hunted
and
persecuted
from
one
part
of
europe
to
another
on
account
of
it
the
first
is
that
he
makes
all
natural
impulses
generous
and
virtuous
and
man
therefore
naturally
good
instead
of
perverse
thus
throwing
not
only
christianity
but
experience
entirely
aside
and
laying
down
maxims
which
logically
carried
out
would
make
society
perfect
if
only
nature
were
always
consulted
this
doctrine
indirectly
makes
all
the
treasures
of
human
experience
useless
and
untutored
impulse
the
guide
of
life
it
would
break
the
restraints
which
civilization
and
a
knowledge
of
life
impose
and
reduce
man
to
a
primitive
state
in
the
advocacy
of
this
subtle
falsehood
rousseau
pours
contempt
on
all
the
teachings
of
mankind
on
all
schools
and
colleges
on
all
conventionalities
and
social
laws
yea
on
learning
itself
he
always
stigmatizes
scholars
as
pedants
secondly
he
would
reduce
woman
to
insignificance
having
her
rule
by
arts
and
small
devices
making
her
the
inferior
of
man
on
whom
she
is
dependent
and
to
whose
caprice
she
is
bound
to
submit
a
sort
of
toy
or
slave
engrossed
only
with
domestic
duties
like
the
woman
of
antiquity
he
would
give
new
rights
and
liberties
to
man
but
none
to
woman
as
man
equal
thus
keeping
her
in
a
dependence
utterly
irreconcilable
with
the
bold
freedom
which
he
otherwise
advocates
the
dangerous
tendency
of
his
writings
is
somewhat
checked
however
by
the
everlasting
hostility
with
which
women
of
character
and
force
of
will
such
as
they
call
will
ever
pursue
him
he
will
be
no
oracle
to
them
but
a
still
more
marked
defect
weakens
émile
as
one
of
the
of
the
world
great
as
are
its
varied
excellencies
the
author
undermines
all
faith
in
christianity
as
a
revelation
or
as
a
means
of
man
communion
with
the
divine
for
guidance
consolation
or
inspiration
nor
does
he
support
one
of
his
moral
or
religious
doctrines
by
an
appeal
to
the
sacred
scriptures
which
have
been
so
deep
a
well
of
moral
and
spiritual
wisdom
for
so
many
races
of
men
practically
he
is
infidel
and
pagan
although
he
professes
to
admire
some
of
the
moral
truths
which
he
never
applies
to
his
system
he
is
a
pure
theist
or
deist
recognizing
like
the
old
greeks
no
religion
but
that
of
nature
and
valuing
no
attainments
but
such
as
are
suggested
by
nature
and
reason
which
are
the
gods
he
worships
from
first
to
last
in
all
his
writings
the
confession
of
faith
by
the
savoyard
vicar
introduced
into
the
fourth
of
the
six
books
of
this
work
which
having
nothing
to
do
with
his
main
object
he
unnecessarily
drags
in
is
an
artful
and
specious
onslaught
on
all
doctrines
and
facts
revealed
in
the
bible
on
all
miracles
all
prophecies
and
all
supernatural
revelation
thus
attacking
christianity
in
its
most
vital
points
and
making
it
of
no
more
authority
than
buddhism
or
mohammedanism
faith
is
utterly
extinguished
a
cold
reason
is
all
that
he
would
leave
to
man
no
consolation
but
what
the
mind
can
arrive
at
unaided
no
knowledge
but
what
can
be
reached
by
original
scientific
investigation
he
destroys
not
only
all
faith
but
all
authority
by
a
low
appeal
to
prejudices
and
by
vulgar
wit
such
as
the
infidels
of
a
former
age
used
in
their
heartless
and
flippant
controversies
i
am
not
surprised
at
the
hostility
displayed
even
in
france
against
him
by
both
catholics
and
protestants
when
he
advocated
his
rights
of
man
from
which
thomas
paine
and
jefferson
himself
drew
their
maxims
he
appealed
to
the
of
the
great
mass
of
men
ground
down
by
feudal
injustices
and
inequalities
to
the
sense
of
justice
sophistically
it
is
true
but
in
a
way
which
commanded
the
respect
of
the
intellect
when
he
assailed
christianity
in
its
innermost
fortresses
while
professing
to
be
a
christian
he
incurred
the
indignation
of
all
christians
and
the
contempt
of
all
infidels
for
he
added
hypocrisy
to
scepticism
which
they
did
not
diderot
and
others
were
bold
unbelievers
and
did
not
veil
their
hostilities
under
a
weak
disguise
i
have
never
read
a
writer
who
in
spirit
was
more
essentially
pagan
than
rousseau
or
who
wrote
maxims
more
entirely
antagonistic
to
christianity
aside
from
these
great
falsities
the
perfection
of
natural
impulse
the
inferiority
of
woman
and
the
worthlessness
of
christianity
as
inculcated
in
this
book
émile
must
certainly
be
ranked
among
the
great
classics
of
educational
literature
with
these
expurgated
it
confirms
the
admirable
methods
inspired
by
its
unmethodical
suggestions
noting
the
oppressiveness
of
the
usual
order
of
education
through
books
and
apparatus
he
scorns
all
tradition
and
cries
let
the
child
learn
direct
from
nature
himself
sensitive
and
humane
having
suffered
as
a
child
from
the
tyranny
of
adults
he
demands
the
tenderest
care
and
sympathy
for
children
a
patient
study
of
their
characteristics
a
gentle
progressive
leading
of
them
to
discover
for
themselves
rather
than
a
cramming
of
them
with
facts
the
first
moral
education
should
be
negative
no
preaching
of
virtue
and
truth
but
shielding
from
vice
and
error
he
says
take
the
very
reverse
of
the
current
practice
and
you
will
almost
always
do
right
this
spirit
indeed
is
the
key
to
his
entire
plan
his
ideas
were
those
of
the
nineteenth
not
the
eighteenth
century
free
play
to
childish
vitality
punishment
the
natural
inconvenience
consequent
on
the
incitement
of
the
desire
to
learn
the
training
of
rather
than
reflection
in
early
years
the
acquirement
of
the
power
to
learn
rather
than
the
acquisition
of
learning
in
short
the
natural
and
scientifically
progressive
rather
than
the
bookish
and
analytically
literary
method
was
the
end
and
aim
of
émile
actually
this
book
accomplished
little
in
its
own
time
chiefly
because
of
its
attack
on
established
religion
influentially
it
reappeared
in
pestalozzi
the
first
practical
reformer
of
methods
in
froebel
the
inventor
of
the
kindergarten
in
spencer
the
great
systematizer
of
the
philosophy
of
development
and
through
these
its
spirit
pervades
the
whole
world
of
education
at
the
present
time
in
rousseau
new
héloïse
there
are
the
same
contradictions
the
same
paradoxes
the
same
unsoundness
as
in
his
other
works
but
it
is
more
eloquent
than
any
it
is
a
novel
in
which
he
paints
all
the
aspirations
of
the
soul
all
its
unrest
all
its
indefinite
longings
its
raptures
and
its
despair
in
which
he
unfetters
the
imagination
and
sanctifies
every
impulse
not
only
of
affection
but
of
passion
this
novel
was
the
pioneer
of
the
sentimental
romances
which
rapidly
followed
in
france
and
england
and
germany
worse
than
our
sensational
literature
since
the
author
veiled
his
immoralities
by
painting
the
transports
of
passion
under
the
guise
of
love
which
ever
has
its
seat
in
the
affections
and
is
sustained
only
by
respect
here
rousseau
was
a
disguised
seducer
a
poisoner
of
the
moral
sentiments
a
foe
to
what
is
most
sacred
and
he
was
the
more
dangerous
from
his
irresistible
eloquence
his
sophistries
in
regard
to
political
and
social
rights
may
be
met
by
reason
but
not
his
attacks
on
the
heart
with
his
imaginary
sorrows
and
joys
his
painting
of
raptures
which
can
never
be
found
here
he
undermines
virtue
as
he
had
undermined
truth
and
law
here
reprobation
must
become
unqualified
and
he
appears
one
of
the
very
worst
men
who
ever
exercised
a
commanding
influence
on
a
wicked
and
perverse
generation
and
this
view
of
the
man
is
rather
confirmed
by
his
own
confessions
a
singularly
attractive
book
yet
from
which
after
the
perusal
of
the
long
catalogue
of
his
sorrows
joys
humiliations
triumphs
ecstasies
and
miseries
glories
and
shame
one
rises
with
great
disappointment
since
no
great
truths
useful
lessons
or
even
ennobling
sentiments
are
impressed
upon
the
mind
to
make
us
wiser
or
better
the
confessions
are
only
a
revelation
of
that
sensibility
excessive
and
morbid
which
reminds
us
of
byron
and
his
misanthropic
poetry
showing
a
man
defiant
proud
vain
unreasonable
unsatisfied
supremely
worldly
and
egotistic
the
first
six
books
are
mere
annals
of
sentimental
debauchery
the
last
six
a
kind
of
thermometer
of
friendship
containing
an
accurate
account
of
kisses
given
and
received
with
slights
huffs
visits
quarrels
suspicions
and
jealousies
interspersed
with
grand
sentiments
and
profound
views
of
life
and
human
nature
yet
all
illustrative
of
the
utter
vanity
of
earth
and
the
failure
of
all
mortal
pleasures
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
an
immortal
mind
the
confessions
remind
us
of
manfred
and
ecclesiastes
blended
exceedingly
readable
and
often
unexceptionable
where
virtue
is
commended
and
vice
portrayed
in
its
true
light
but
on
the
whole
a
book
which
no
unsophisticated
or
inexperienced
person
can
read
without
the
consciousness
of
receiving
a
moral
taint
a
book
in
no
respect
leading
to
repose
or
lofty
contemplation
or
to
submission
to
the
evils
of
life
which
it
catalogues
with
amazing
detail
a
book
not
even
conducive
to
innocent
entertainment
it
is
the
revelation
of
the
inner
life
of
a
sensualist
an
egotist
and
a
hypocrite
with
a
maudlin
although
genuine
admiration
for
nature
and
virtue
and
friendship
and
love
and
the
book
reveals
one
of
the
most
miserable
and
dissatisfied
men
that
ever
walked
the
earth
seeking
peace
in
solitude
and
virtue
while
yielding
to
unrestrained
impulses
a
man
of
morbid
sensibility
ever
yearning
for
happiness
and
pursuing
it
by
impossible
and
impracticable
paths
no
sadder
autobiography
has
ever
been
written
it
is
a
lame
and
impotent
attempt
at
revealing
on
every
page
the
writer
distrust
of
the
virtues
which
he
exalts
and
of
man
whose
reason
and
majesty
he
deifies
even
of
the
friendships
in
which
he
sought
consolation
and
of
the
retirements
where
he
hoped
for
rest
the
book
reveals
the
man
the
writer
has
no
hope
or
repose
or
faith
nothing
pleases
him
long
and
he
is
driven
by
his
wild
and
undisciplined
nature
from
one
retreat
to
another
by
persecution
more
fancied
than
real
until
he
dies
not
without
suspicion
of
having
taken
his
own
life
such
was
rousseau
the
greatest
literary
genius
of
his
age
the
apostle
of
the
reforms
which
were
attempted
in
the
french
revolution
and
of
ideas
which
still
have
a
wondrous
power
some
of
which
are
grand
and
true
but
more
of
which
are
sophistical
false
and
dangerous
his
theories
are
all
plausible
and
all
are
enforced
with
matchless
eloquence
of
style
but
not
with
eloquence
of
thought
or
true
feeling
like
the
soaring
flights
of
pascal
in
every
respect
his
superior
in
genius
because
more
profound
and
lofty
rousseau
writings
like
his
life
are
one
vast
contradiction
the
blending
of
truth
with
error
the
truth
valuable
even
when
commonplace
the
error
subtle
and
dangerous
so
that
his
general
influence
must
be
considered
bad
wherever
man
is
weak
or
credulous
or
inexperienced
or
perverse
i
wish
i
could
speak
better
of
a
man
whom
so
many
honestly
admire
and
whose
influence
has
been
so
marked
during
the
last
hundred
years
and
will
be
equally
great
for
a
hundred
years
to
come
a
man
from
whom
madame
de
staël
jefferson
and
lamartine
drew
so
much
of
their
inspiration
whose
ideas
about
childhood
have
so
helpfully
transformed
the
educational
methods
of
our
own
time
but
i
must
speak
my
honest
conviction
from
the
light
i
have
at
the
same
time
hoping
that
fuller
light
may
justify
more
leniency
to
one
of
the
great
oracles
whose
doctrines
are
still
cherished
by
many
of
the
guides
of
modern
thought
sir
walter
scott
the
modern
novel
in
the
early
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
two
most
prominent
figures
in
english
literature
were
sir
walter
scott
and
lord
byron
they
are
still
read
and
admired
especially
scott
but
it
is
not
easy
to
understand
the
enormous
popularity
of
these
two
men
in
their
own
day
their
busts
or
pictures
were
in
every
cultivated
family
and
in
almost
every
everybody
was
familiar
with
the
lineaments
of
their
countenances
and
even
with
every
peculiarity
of
their
dress
who
did
not
know
the
shape
of
the
byronic
collar
and
the
rough
plaided
form
of
the
wizard
of
the
north
who
could
not
repeat
the
most
famous
passages
in
the
writings
of
these
two
authors
is
it
so
now
if
not
what
a
commentary
might
be
written
on
human
fame
how
transitory
are
the
judgments
of
men
in
regard
to
every
one
whom
fashion
stamps
the
verdict
of
critics
is
that
only
some
authors
are
now
read
with
the
interest
and
glow
which
their
works
called
out
a
hundred
years
ago
even
the
novels
of
sir
walter
although
to
be
found
in
every
library
kindle
but
little
enthusiasm
compared
with
that
excited
by
the
masterpieces
of
thackeray
dickens
george
eliot
and
of
the
favorites
of
the
passing
day
why
is
this
will
these
later
lights
also
cease
to
burn
will
they
too
pass
away
is
this
age
so
much
advanced
that
what
pleased
our
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
has
no
charm
for
us
but
is
often
flat
stale
and
unprofitable
at
least
decidedly
uninteresting
i
am
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
only
a
very
small
part
of
any
writings
is
really
immortal
take
out
the
elegy
in
a
country
churchyard
and
how
much
is
left
of
gray
for
other
generations
to
admire
and
so
of
goldsmith
besides
the
vicar
of
wakefield
and
the
deserted
village
there
is
little
in
his
writings
that
is
likely
to
prove
immortal
johnson
wrote
but
little
poetry
that
is
now
generally
valued
certainly
his
dictionary
his
greatest
work
is
not
immortal
and
is
scarcely
a
standard
indeed
we
have
outgrown
nearly
everything
which
was
prized
so
highly
a
century
ago
not
only
in
poetry
and
fiction
but
in
philosophy
theology
and
science
perhaps
that
is
least
permanent
which
once
was
regarded
as
most
certain
if
then
the
poetry
and
novels
of
sir
walter
scott
are
not
so
much
read
or
admired
as
they
once
were
we
only
say
that
he
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
i
have
in
mind
but
two
authors
in
the
whole
range
of
english
literature
that
are
read
and
prized
as
much
as
they
were
two
hundred
years
ago
and
if
this
is
true
what
shall
we
say
of
rhetoricians
like
macaulay
of
critics
like
carlyle
of
theologians
like
jonathan
edwards
of
historians
like
hume
and
guizot
and
of
many
other
great
men
of
whom
it
has
been
the
fashion
to
say
that
their
works
are
lasting
as
the
language
in
which
they
were
written
some
few
books
will
doubtless
live
but
alas
how
few
where
now
are
the
eight
hundred
thousand
in
the
alexandrian
library
which
ptolemy
collected
with
so
great
care
what
even
their
titles
where
are
the
writings
of
varro
said
to
have
been
the
most
learned
man
of
all
antiquity
i
make
these
introductory
remarks
to
show
how
shallow
is
the
criticism
passed
upon
a
novelist
or
poet
like
scott
in
that
he
is
not
now
so
popular
or
so
much
read
as
he
was
in
his
own
day
it
is
the
fate
of
most
great
writers
the
augustines
the
voltaires
the
bayles
of
the
world
it
is
enough
to
say
that
they
were
lauded
and
valued
in
their
time
since
this
is
about
all
we
can
say
of
most
of
the
works
supposed
to
be
immortal
but
when
we
remember
the
enthusiasm
with
which
the
novels
of
scott
were
at
first
received
the
great
sums
of
money
which
were
paid
for
them
and
the
honors
he
received
from
them
he
may
well
claim
a
renown
and
a
popularity
such
as
no
other
literary
man
ever
enjoyed
his
eyes
beheld
the
glory
of
a
great
name
his
ears
rang
with
the
plaudits
of
idolaters
he
had
the
consciousness
of
doing
good
work
universally
acknowledged
and
gratefully
remembered
scarcely
any
other
novelist
ever
created
so
much
healthy
pleasure
combined
with
so
much
sound
instruction
and
further
he
left
behind
him
a
reproachless
name
having
fewer
personal
defects
than
any
literary
man
of
his
time
being
everywhere
beloved
esteemed
and
almost
worshipped
whom
distant
travellers
came
to
see
sure
of
kind
and
gracious
treatment
a
hero
in
their
eyes
to
the
last
with
no
drawbacks
such
as
marred
the
fame
of
byron
or
of
burns
that
so
great
a
genius
as
scott
is
fading
in
the
minds
of
this
generation
may
be
not
without
comfort
to
those
honest
and
men
in
every
walk
of
human
life
who
can
say
we
too
were
useful
in
our
day
and
had
our
share
of
honors
and
rewards
all
perhaps
that
we
deserved
or
even
more
what
if
we
are
forgotten
as
most
men
are
destined
to
be
to
live
in
the
mouths
of
men
is
not
the
greatest
thing
or
the
best
act
well
your
part
there
all
the
honor
lies
for
life
after
all
is
a
drama
or
a
stage
the
supremest
happiness
is
not
in
being
praised
it
is
in
the
consciousness
of
doing
right
and
being
possessed
with
the
power
of
goodness
when
however
a
man
has
been
seated
on
such
a
lofty
pinnacle
as
was
sir
walter
scott
we
wish
to
know
something
of
his
personal
traits
and
the
steps
by
which
he
advanced
to
fame
was
he
overrated
as
most
famous
men
have
been
what
is
the
niche
he
will
probably
occupy
in
the
temple
of
literary
fame
what
are
the
characteristics
of
his
productions
what
gave
him
his
prodigious
and
extraordinary
popularity
was
he
a
born
genius
like
byron
and
burns
or
was
he
merely
a
most
industrious
worker
aided
by
fortunate
circumstances
and
the
caprices
of
fashion
what
were
the
intellectual
forces
of
his
day
and
how
did
he
come
to
be
counted
among
them
all
these
points
it
is
difficult
to
answer
satisfactorily
but
some
light
may
be
shed
upon
them
the
bulky
volumes
of
lockhart
biography
constitute
a
mine
of
information
about
scott
but
are
now
heavy
reading
without
much
vivacity
affording
a
strong
contrast
to
boswell
life
of
johnson
which
concealed
nothing
that
we
would
like
to
know
a
is
not
likely
to
be
a
dispassionate
biographer
especially
when
family
pride
and
interests
restrain
him
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
wise
for
a
biographer
to
be
too
candid
and
belittle
his
hero
by
the
enumeration
of
foibles
not
consistent
with
the
general
tenor
of
the
man
life
lockhart
knowledge
of
his
subject
and
his
literary
skill
have
given
us
much
and
with
scott
own
letters
and
the
critical
notice
of
his
contemporaries
both
the
man
and
his
works
may
be
fairly
estimated
most
biographers
aim
to
make
the
birth
and
parentage
of
their
heroes
as
respectable
as
possible
of
authors
who
are
nobly
born
there
are
very
few
most
english
and
scotch
literary
men
are
descended
from
ancestors
of
the
middle
class
lawyers
clergymen
physicians
small
landed
proprietors
merchants
and
so
on
who
were
able
to
give
their
sons
an
education
in
the
universities
sir
walter
scott
traced
his
descent
to
an
ancient
scottish
chief
his
grandfather
robert
scott
was
bred
to
the
sea
but
being
near
dundee
he
became
a
farmer
and
was
active
in
the
scott
father
was
a
writer
to
the
signet
in
edinburgh
what
would
be
called
in
england
a
solicitor
a
thriving
respectable
man
having
a
large
and
lucrative
legal
practice
and
being
highly
esteemed
for
his
industry
and
integrity
a
zealous
presbyterian
formal
and
precise
in
manner
strict
in
the
observance
of
the
sabbath
and
of
all
that
he
considered
to
be
right
his
wife
anne
rutherford
was
the
daughter
of
a
professor
of
medicine
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
a
lady
of
rather
better
education
than
the
average
of
her
time
a
mother
whom
sir
walter
remembered
with
great
tenderness
and
to
whose
ample
memory
and
power
of
graphic
description
he
owed
much
of
his
own
skill
in
reproducing
the
past
twelve
children
were
the
offspring
of
this
marriage
although
only
five
survived
very
early
youth
walter
the
ninth
child
was
born
on
the
of
august
and
when
quite
young
in
consequence
of
a
fever
lost
for
a
time
the
use
of
his
right
leg
by
the
advice
of
his
grandfather
rutherford
he
was
sent
into
the
country
for
his
health
as
his
lameness
continued
he
was
at
the
age
of
four
removed
to
bath
going
to
london
by
sea
bath
was
then
a
noted
resort
and
its
waters
were
supposed
to
cure
everything
here
little
walter
remained
a
year
under
the
care
of
his
aunt
when
he
returned
to
edinburgh
to
his
father
house
in
george
square
which
was
his
residence
until
his
marriage
with
occasional
visits
to
the
county
seat
of
his
maternal
grandfather
he
completely
regained
his
health
although
he
was
always
lame
from
the
autobiography
which
scott
began
but
did
not
complete
it
would
appear
that
his
lameness
and
solitary
habits
were
favorable
to
reading
that
even
as
a
child
he
was
greatly
excited
by
tales
and
poems
of
adventure
and
that
as
a
youth
he
devoured
everything
he
could
find
pertaining
to
early
scottish
poetry
and
romance
of
which
he
was
passionately
fond
he
was
also
peculiarly
susceptible
to
the
beauties
of
scottish
scenery
being
thus
led
to
enjoy
the
country
and
its
sports
at
a
much
earlier
age
than
is
common
with
boys
which
love
was
never
lost
but
grew
with
his
advancing
years
among
his
fellows
he
was
a
hearty
player
a
forward
fighter
in
boyish
bickers
and
a
teller
of
tales
that
delighted
his
comrades
he
was
merry
generous
and
yet
peremptory
and
pertinacious
in
pursuit
of
his
own
ideas
in
walter
was
sent
to
the
high
school
in
edinburgh
but
his
progress
here
was
by
no
means
remarkable
although
he
laid
a
good
foundation
for
the
acquisition
of
the
latin
language
he
also
had
a
tutor
at
home
and
from
him
learned
the
rudiments
of
french
with
a
head
all
on
fire
for
chivalry
and
scottish
ballads
he
admired
the
old
tory
cavaliers
and
hated
the
roundheads
and
presbyterians
in
three
years
he
had
become
fairly
familiar
with
caesar
livy
sallust
virgil
horace
and
terence
he
also
distinguished
himself
by
making
latin
verses
from
the
high
school
he
entered
the
university
of
edinburgh
very
well
grounded
in
french
and
latin
for
greek
and
mathematics
he
had
an
aversion
but
made
up
for
this
deficiency
by
considerable
acquisitions
in
english
literature
he
was
delighted
with
both
ossian
and
spenser
and
could
repeat
the
faërie
queene
by
heart
his
memory
like
that
of
macaulay
was
remarkable
what
delighted
him
more
than
spenser
were
hoole
translations
of
tasso
and
ariosto
later
he
learned
italian
and
read
these
in
the
original
and
percy
reliques
of
ancient
poetry
at
college
he
also
read
the
best
novels
of
the
day
especially
the
works
of
richardson
fielding
and
smollett
he
made
respectable
progress
in
philosophy
under
the
teaching
of
the
celebrated
dugald
stewart
and
professor
bruce
and
in
history
under
lord
woodhouselee
on
the
whole
he
was
not
a
remarkable
boy
except
for
his
notable
memory
which
however
kept
only
what
pleased
him
and
his
very
decided
bent
toward
the
poetic
and
chivalric
in
history
life
and
literature
walter
was
trained
by
his
father
to
the
law
and
on
leaving
college
he
served
the
ordinary
apprenticeship
of
five
years
in
his
father
office
and
attendance
upon
the
law
classes
in
the
university
but
the
drudgery
of
the
law
was
irksome
to
him
when
the
time
came
to
select
his
profession
as
a
writer
to
the
signet
or
an
advocate
he
preferred
the
latter
although
success
here
was
more
uncertain
than
as
a
solicitor
up
to
the
time
of
his
admission
to
the
bar
he
had
read
an
enormous
number
of
books
in
a
desultory
way
and
made
many
friends
some
of
whom
afterwards
became
distinguished
his
greatest
pleasures
were
in
long
walks
in
the
country
with
chosen
companions
his
love
of
nature
amounted
to
a
passion
and
in
his
long
rambles
he
acquired
not
only
vigorous
health
but
the
capacity
of
undergoing
great
fatigue
scott
autobiography
closes
with
his
admission
to
the
bar
from
his
own
account
his
early
career
had
not
been
particularly
promising
although
he
was
neither
idle
nor
immoral
he
was
fond
of
convivial
pleasures
but
ever
had
uncommon
all
his
instructors
were
gentlemanly
and
he
had
access
to
the
best
society
in
edinburgh
when
that
city
was
noted
for
its
number
of
distinguished
men
in
literature
and
in
the
different
professions
his
most
intimate
friends
were
john
irving
sir
archibald
campbell
the
earl
of
dalhousie
and
adam
ferguson
with
whom
he
made
excursions
to
the
highlands
and
to
ruined
castles
and
abbeys
of
historic
interest
following
with
tireless
search
the
new
trail
of
an
old
border
ballad
or
taking
a
walk
to
clear
up
some
local
legend
of
battle
foray
or
historic
event
in
all
these
antiquarian
raids
the
young
fellows
mingled
freely
with
the
people
and
tramped
the
counties
round
about
in
most
hilarious
mood
by
no
means
escaping
the
habits
of
the
day
in
tavern
sprees
and
although
companions
testify
to
his
temperate
indulgence
the
young
lawyer
was
indeed
unwittingly
preparing
for
his
mission
to
paint
scottish
scenery
so
vividly
and
scottish
character
so
charmingly
that
he
may
almost
be
said
to
have
created
a
new
country
which
succeeding
generations
delight
to
visit
no
man
was
ever
a
greater
benefactor
to
scotland
whose
glories
and
beauties
he
was
the
first
to
reveal
showing
how
the
most
thrifty
practical
and
parsimonious
people
may
be
at
the
same
time
the
most
poetic
here
burns
and
he
go
hand
in
hand
although
as
a
poet
scott
declared
that
he
was
not
to
be
named
in
the
same
day
with
the
most
unfortunate
man
of
genius
that
his
country
and
his
century
produced
how
singular
that
in
all
worldly
matters
the
greater
genius
should
have
been
a
failure
while
he
who
as
a
born
poet
was
the
lesser
light
should
have
been
the
greatest
popular
success
of
which
scotland
can
boast
and
yet
there
is
something
almost
as
pathetic
and
tragical
in
the
career
of
the
man
who
worked
himself
to
death
as
in
that
of
the
man
who
drank
himself
to
death
the
most
supremely
fortunate
writer
of
his
day
came
to
a
mournful
end
notwithstanding
his
unparalleled
honors
and
his
magnificent
rewards
at
the
time
scott
was
admitted
to
the
bar
he
was
not
of
course
aware
of
his
great
original
creative
powers
nor
could
he
have
had
very
sanguine
expectations
of
a
brilliant
career
the
profession
he
had
chosen
was
not
congenial
with
his
habits
or
his
genius
and
hence
as
a
lawyer
he
was
not
a
success
and
yet
he
was
not
a
failure
for
he
had
the
respect
of
some
of
the
finest
minds
in
edinburgh
and
at
once
gained
as
an
advocate
enough
to
support
himself
respectably
among
aristocratic
people
aided
no
doubt
by
his
father
who
as
a
prosperous
writer
to
the
signet
threw
business
into
his
hands
amid
his
practice
at
the
courts
he
found
time
to
visit
some
of
the
most
interesting
spots
in
scotland
and
he
had
money
enough
to
gratify
his
tastes
he
was
a
thriving
rather
than
a
prosperous
lawyer
that
is
to
say
he
earned
his
living
but
scott
was
too
much
absorbed
in
literary
studies
and
in
writing
ballads
to
give
to
his
numerous
friends
the
hope
of
a
distinguished
legal
career
no
man
can
serve
two
masters
his
heart
was
in
the
highlands
the
deer
or
ransacking
distant
villages
for
antiquarian
lore
or
collecting
ancient
scottish
minstrelsy
or
visiting
and
ruins
famous
before
john
knox
swept
monasteries
and
nunneries
away
as
cages
of
unclean
birds
but
most
of
all
was
he
interested
in
the
feuds
between
the
lowland
and
highland
chieftains
and
in
the
contest
between
roundheads
and
cavaliers
when
scotland
lost
her
political
independence
he
did
however
find
much
in
scotch
law
to
enrich
his
mind
with
entanglements
and
antiquarian
records
as
well
as
the
humors
and
tragedies
of
the
courts
and
of
this
his
writings
show
many
traces
no
young
lawyer
ever
had
more
efficient
friends
than
walter
scott
and
richly
he
deserved
them
for
he
was
generous
companionable
loyal
a
brilliant
a
good
hunter
and
sportsman
bright
cheerful
and
witty
doubtless
one
of
the
most
interesting
young
men
in
his
beautiful
city
modest
too
and
unpretentious
yet
proud
claiming
nothing
that
nothing
might
be
denied
him
a
favorite
in
the
most
select
circles
his
most
striking
peculiarity
was
his
good
sense
keeping
him
from
all
exaggerations
which
were
always
offensive
to
him
he
was
a
tory
indeed
but
no
aristocrat
ever
had
a
more
genial
humanity
taking
pleasure
in
any
society
where
he
could
learn
anything
his
appetite
was
so
healthy
from
his
rural
sports
and
pedestrian
feats
that
he
could
dine
equally
well
on
a
broiled
haddock
or
a
saddle
of
venison
although
from
the
minuteness
of
his
descriptions
of
scottish
banquets
one
might
infer
that
he
had
great
appreciation
of
the
pleasures
of
the
table
it
is
not
easy
to
tell
when
scott
began
to
write
poetry
but
probably
when
he
was
quite
young
he
wrote
for
the
pleasure
of
it
without
any
idea
of
devoting
his
life
to
literature
writing
ballads
was
the
solace
of
his
leisure
hours
his
acquaintance
with
francis
lord
jeffrey
began
in
at
a
club
where
he
read
an
essay
on
ballads
which
so
much
interested
the
future
critic
that
he
sought
an
introduction
to
its
author
and
the
acquaintance
thus
begun
between
these
two
young
men
both
of
whom
unconsciously
stood
on
the
threshold
of
great
careers
ripened
into
friendship
this
happened
before
scott
was
called
to
the
bar
in
it
was
two
years
afterwards
that
he
produced
a
poem
which
took
by
surprise
a
literary
friend
miss
cranstoun
and
caused
her
to
exclaim
upon
my
word
walter
scott
is
going
to
turn
out
a
poet
something
of
a
cross
between
burns
and
gray
in
scott
was
appointed
one
of
the
curators
of
the
library
a
compliment
bestowed
only
on
those
members
of
the
bar
known
to
have
a
zeal
in
literary
affairs
but
i
do
not
read
that
he
published
anything
until
when
appeared
his
translation
from
the
german
of
bürger
ballads
the
wild
huntsman
and
lenore
this
called
out
high
commendation
from
dugald
stewart
the
famous
professor
of
moral
philosophy
in
the
university
of
edinburgh
and
from
other
men
of
note
but
obtained
no
recognition
in
england
it
was
during
one
of
his
rambles
with
his
friend
ferguson
to
the
english
lakes
in
that
scott
met
miss
charlotte
margaret
carpenter
or
charpentier
a
young
french
lady
of
notable
beauty
and
lovely
character
she
had
an
income
of
about
a
year
which
added
to
his
earnings
as
an
advocate
then
about
encouraged
him
to
offer
to
her
his
hand
for
a
young
couple
just
starting
in
life
was
an
independence
the
engagement
met
with
no
opposition
from
the
lady
family
and
in
december
of
scott
was
married
and
took
a
modest
house
in
castle
street
being
then
years
of
age
the
marriage
turned
out
to
be
a
happy
one
although
had
something
to
do
with
it
of
course
so
healthy
and
romantic
a
nature
as
scott
had
not
passed
through
the
susceptible
time
of
youth
without
a
love
affair
from
so
small
a
circumstance
as
the
lending
of
his
umbrella
to
a
young
lady
margaret
the
beautiful
daughter
of
sir
john
belches
he
enjoyed
five
years
of
affection
and
of
what
seems
to
have
been
a
reasonable
hope
which
however
was
finally
ended
by
the
young
lady
marrying
william
forbes
a
banker
and
later
one
of
scott
best
friends
three
years
of
dreaming
and
two
years
of
waking
scott
calls
it
in
one
of
his
diaries
thirty
years
later
and
his
own
marriage
followed
within
a
year
after
that
of
his
lost
love
with
an
income
sufficient
only
for
the
necessities
of
life
as
a
married
man
in
society
scott
had
not
much
to
spare
for
expensive
dinners
although
given
to
hospitality
what
money
he
could
save
was
spent
for
books
and
travel
at
he
had
visited
what
was
most
interesting
in
scotland
either
in
scenery
or
historical
associations
and
some
parts
of
england
especially
the
cumberland
lakes
he
took
a
cottage
at
lasswade
near
edinburgh
and
began
there
the
fascinating
pursuit
of
and
place
his
vacations
when
the
courts
were
not
in
session
were
spent
in
excursions
to
mountain
scenery
and
those
retired
villages
where
he
could
pick
up
antiquarian
lore
particularly
old
border
ballads
heroic
traditions
of
the
times
of
chivalry
and
of
the
conflicts
of
scottish
chieftains
concerning
these
no
man
in
scotland
knew
so
much
as
he
his
knowledge
furnishing
the
foundation
alike
of
his
lays
and
his
romances
his
enthusiasm
for
these
scenic
and
historic
interests
was
unquenchable
a
source
of
perpetual
enjoyment
which
made
him
a
most
acceptable
visitor
wherever
he
chose
to
go
both
among
antiquaries
and
literary
men
and
ladies
of
rank
and
fashion
in
march
and
scott
visited
london
where
they
were
introduced
to
many
distinguished
literary
men
on
their
return
to
edinburgh
the
office
of
sheriff
depute
of
selkirkshire
having
become
vacant
worth
a
year
scott
received
the
appointment
which
increased
his
income
to
about
although
his
labors
were
light
the
office
entailed
the
necessity
of
living
in
that
county
a
few
months
in
each
year
it
was
a
pastoral
quiet
peaceful
part
of
the
country
belonging
to
the
duke
of
buccleuch
his
friend
and
patron
his
published
translation
in
this
year
of
goethe
goetz
of
berlichingen
added
to
his
growing
reputation
and
led
him
on
towards
his
career
with
a
secure
and
settled
income
scott
now
meditated
a
literary
life
a
hundred
years
ago
such
a
life
was
impossible
without
independent
means
if
a
man
would
mingle
in
society
and
live
conventionally
and
what
was
called
respectably
even
burns
had
to
accept
a
public
office
although
it
was
a
humble
one
and
far
from
lucrative
but
it
gave
him
what
poetry
could
not
his
daily
bread
hogg
of
the
ettrick
forest
was
supported
in
all
his
earlier
years
by
tending
sheep
and
borrowing
money
from
his
friends
the
first
genuine
literary
adventure
of
scott
was
his
collection
of
a
scottish
minstrelsy
printed
for
him
by
james
ballantyne
a
former
schoolfellow
who
had
been
encouraged
by
scott
to
open
a
shop
in
edinburgh
the
preparation
of
this
labor
of
love
occupied
the
editor
a
year
assisted
by
john
leyden
a
man
of
great
promise
who
died
in
india
in
having
made
a
mark
as
an
orientalist
about
this
time
began
scott
memorable
friendship
with
george
ellis
the
most
discriminating
and
useful
of
all
his
literary
friends
in
the
same
year
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
thomas
campbell
the
poet
who
had
already
achieved
fame
by
his
pleasures
of
hope
it
was
in
that
the
first
and
second
volumes
of
the
minstrelsy
appeared
in
an
edition
of
eight
hundred
copies
scott
share
of
the
profits
amounting
to
which
did
not
pay
him
for
the
actual
expenditure
in
the
collection
of
his
materials
the
historical
notes
with
which
he
elucidated
the
value
of
the
ancient
ballads
and
the
freshness
and
vigor
of
those
which
he
himself
wrote
for
the
collection
secured
warm
commendations
from
ellis
ritson
and
other
friends
and
the
whole
edition
was
sold
yet
the
work
did
not
bring
him
wide
fame
the
third
and
last
volume
was
issued
in
the
work
is
full
of
scott
best
characteristics
wide
historical
knowledge
wonderful
industry
humor
pathos
and
a
sympathetic
understanding
of
life
that
of
the
peasant
as
well
as
the
knight
such
as
seizes
the
imagination
lockhart
quotes
a
passage
of
scott
own
i
am
sensible
that
if
there
be
anything
good
about
my
poetry
or
prose
either
it
is
hurried
frankness
of
which
pleases
soldiers
sailors
and
young
people
of
bold
and
active
dispositions
his
ability
to
toil
terribly
in
accumulating
choice
material
and
then
fusing
it
in
his
own
spirit
to
throw
it
forth
among
men
with
this
hurried
frankness
that
stirs
the
blood
was
the
secret
of
his
power
scott
did
not
become
famous
however
until
his
first
original
poem
appeared
the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
printed
by
ballantyne
in
and
published
by
longman
of
london
and
constable
of
edinburgh
it
was
a
great
success
nearly
fifty
thousand
copies
were
sold
in
great
britain
alone
by
for
the
first
edition
of
seven
hundred
and
fifty
copies
quarto
scott
received
and
then
sold
the
copyright
for
in
the
meantime
a
rich
uncle
died
without
children
and
scott
share
of
the
property
enabled
him
in
to
rent
from
his
cousin
sir
james
russell
the
pretty
property
called
ashestiel
a
cottage
and
farm
on
the
banks
of
the
tweed
altogether
a
beautiful
place
where
he
lived
when
discharging
his
duties
of
sheriff
of
selkirkshire
he
has
celebrated
the
charms
of
ashestiel
in
the
canto
introduction
to
marmion
his
income
at
this
time
amounted
to
about
a
year
which
gave
him
a
position
among
the
squires
of
the
neighborhood
complete
independence
and
leisure
to
cultivate
his
taste
his
fortune
was
now
made
with
poetic
fame
besides
and
powerful
friends
he
was
a
man
every
way
to
be
envied
the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
placed
scott
among
the
three
great
poets
of
scotland
for
originality
and
beauty
of
rhyme
it
is
not
marked
by
pathos
or
by
philosophical
reflections
it
is
a
purely
descriptive
poem
of
great
vivacity
and
vividness
easy
to
read
and
true
to
nature
it
is
a
tale
of
chivalry
and
is
to
poetry
what
froissart
chronicles
are
to
history
nothing
exactly
like
it
had
before
appeared
in
english
literature
it
appealed
to
all
people
of
romantic
tastes
and
was
reproachless
from
a
moral
point
of
view
it
was
a
book
for
a
bower
full
of
chivalric
sentiments
and
stirring
incidents
and
of
unflagging
interest
from
beginning
to
end
partly
warlike
and
partly
monastic
describing
the
adventures
of
knights
and
monks
it
deals
with
wizards
harpers
dwarfs
priests
warriors
and
noble
dames
it
sings
of
love
and
wassailings
of
gentle
ladies
tears
of
castles
and
festal
halls
of
pennons
and
lances
of
ancient
deeds
so
long
forgot
of
feuds
whose
memory
was
not
of
forests
now
laid
waste
and
bare
of
towers
which
harbor
now
the
hare
in
the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
there
is
at
least
one
immortal
stanza
which
would
redeem
the
poem
even
if
otherwise
mediocre
how
few
poets
can
claim
as
much
as
this
very
few
poems
live
except
for
some
splendid
passages
which
can
not
be
forgotten
and
which
give
fame
i
know
of
nothing
even
in
burns
finer
than
the
following
lines
breathes
there
the
man
with
soul
so
dead
who
never
to
himself
hath
said
this
is
my
own
my
native
land
whose
heart
hath
within
him
burned
as
home
his
footsteps
he
hath
turned
from
wandering
on
a
foreign
strand
if
such
there
breathe
go
mark
him
well
for
him
no
minstrel
raptures
swell
high
though
his
titles
proud
his
name
boundless
his
wealth
as
wish
can
claim
despite
those
titles
power
and
pelf
the
wretch
concentred
all
in
self
living
shall
forfeit
fair
renown
and
doubly
dying
shall
go
down
to
the
vile
dust
from
whence
he
sprung
unwept
unhonored
and
unsung
the
favor
with
which
the
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
was
received
greater
than
that
of
any
narrative
poem
of
equal
length
which
had
appeared
for
two
generations
even
since
dryden
day
naturally
brought
great
commendation
from
jeffrey
the
keenest
critic
of
the
age
in
the
famous
magazine
of
which
he
was
the
editor
the
edinburgh
review
had
been
started
only
in
by
three
young
men
of
genius
jeffrey
brougham
and
sydney
smith
and
had
already
attained
great
popularity
but
not
such
marvellous
influence
as
it
wielded
ten
years
afterwards
when
nine
thousand
copies
were
published
every
three
months
and
at
such
a
price
as
gave
to
its
contributors
a
splendid
remuneration
and
to
its
editors
absolute
critical
independence
the
only
objection
to
this
powerful
periodical
was
the
severity
of
its
criticisms
which
often
also
were
unjust
it
seemed
to
be
the
intent
of
the
reviewers
to
demolish
everything
that
was
not
of
extraordinary
merit
fierce
attacks
are
not
criticism
the
articles
in
the
edinburgh
review
were
of
a
different
sort
from
the
polished
and
candid
literary
dissections
which
made
so
justly
celebrated
in
the
beginning
of
the
century
however
these
savage
attacks
were
all
the
fashion
and
to
be
expected
yet
they
stung
authors
almost
to
madness
as
in
the
case
of
the
review
of
byron
early
poetry
literary
courtesy
did
not
exist
justice
gave
place
generally
to
ridicule
or
sarcasm
the
edinburgh
review
was
a
terror
to
all
pretenders
and
often
to
men
of
real
merit
but
it
was
published
when
most
judges
were
cruel
and
severe
even
in
the
halls
of
justice
the
friendship
between
scott
and
jeffrey
had
been
very
close
for
ten
years
before
the
inception
of
the
edinburgh
review
and
although
scott
was
perhaps
growing
out
of
his
love
for
antiquarian
researches
and
admiration
of
the
things
that
had
been
an
inveterate
conservative
and
tory
while
the
new
review
was
slashingly
liberal
and
progressive
he
was
drawn
in
by
friendship
and
literary
interest
to
be
a
frequent
contributor
during
its
first
three
or
four
years
the
politics
of
the
edinburgh
review
however
and
the
establishment
in
of
the
conservative
quarterly
review
caused
a
gradual
cessation
of
this
literary
connection
without
marring
the
friendly
relations
between
the
two
men
about
this
time
began
scott
friendship
with
wordsworth
for
whom
he
had
great
respect
indeed
his
modesty
led
him
to
prefer
good
poetry
to
his
own
he
felt
himself
inferior
not
only
to
burns
but
also
to
wordsworth
and
campbell
and
coleridge
and
byron
as
in
many
respects
he
undoubtedly
was
but
it
requires
in
an
author
discernment
and
humility
of
a
rare
kind
to
make
him
capable
of
such
a
discrimination
more
important
to
him
than
any
literary
friendship
was
his
partnership
with
james
ballantyne
the
printer
whom
he
had
known
from
his
youth
this
in
the
end
proved
unfortunate
and
nearly
ruined
him
for
ballantyne
though
an
accomplished
man
and
a
fine
printer
as
well
as
enterprising
and
sensible
was
not
a
safe
business
man
being
for
a
time
however
this
partnership
which
was
kept
secret
was
an
advantage
to
both
parties
although
scott
embarked
in
the
enterprise
his
whole
available
capital
about
in
connection
with
the
publishing
business
soon
added
to
the
printing
with
james
ballantyne
brother
john
as
of
the
concern
a
talented
but
dissipated
and
reckless
good
fellow
with
no
more
head
for
business
than
either
james
ballantyne
or
scott
the
association
bound
scott
hand
and
foot
for
twenty
years
and
prompted
him
to
adventurous
undertakings
but
it
must
be
said
that
the
ballantynes
always
deferred
to
him
having
for
him
a
sentiment
little
short
of
veneration
one
of
the
first
results
of
this
partnership
was
an
edition
of
dryden
poems
with
a
life
which
must
have
been
to
scott
little
more
than
drudgery
he
was
well
paid
for
his
work
although
it
added
but
little
to
his
fame
except
for
intelligent
literary
industry
before
the
dryden
however
in
the
same
year
appeared
the
poem
of
marmion
a
tale
of
flodden
field
which
was
received
by
the
public
with
great
avidity
and
unbounded
delight
jeffrey
wrote
a
chilling
review
for
which
scott
with
difficulty
forgave
him
since
with
all
his
humility
and
amiability
he
could
not
bear
unfriendly
or
severe
criticism
in
a
letter
to
joanna
baillie
scott
makes
some
very
sensible
remarks
as
to
the
incapability
of
such
a
man
as
jeffrey
appreciating
a
work
of
the
imagination
distinguished
as
he
was
i
really
have
often
told
him
that
i
think
he
wants
the
taste
for
poetry
which
is
essentially
necessary
to
enjoy
and
of
course
to
criticize
with
justice
he
is
learned
with
the
most
learned
in
its
canons
and
laws
skilled
in
its
modulations
and
an
excellent
judge
of
the
justice
of
the
sentiments
which
it
conveys
but
he
wants
that
enthusiastic
feeling
which
like
sunshine
upon
a
landscape
lights
up
every
beauty
and
palliates
if
it
can
not
hide
every
defect
to
offer
a
poem
of
imagination
to
a
man
whose
whole
life
and
study
have
been
to
acquire
a
stoical
indifference
towards
enthusiasm
of
every
kind
would
be
the
last
as
it
would
surely
be
the
silliest
action
of
my
life
as
stated
above
it
was
about
this
time
that
scott
broke
off
his
connection
with
the
edinburgh
review
perhaps
that
was
what
jeffrey
wished
since
the
review
became
thenceforth
more
intensely
partisan
and
scott
toryism
was
not
what
was
wanted
it
is
fair
to
add
that
in
jeffrey
sent
scott
advance
proofs
of
his
critique
on
the
lady
of
the
lake
with
a
frank
and
friendly
letter
in
which
he
says
i
am
now
sensible
that
there
were
needless
asperities
in
my
review
of
and
from
the
hurry
in
which
i
have
been
forced
to
write
i
dare
say
there
may
be
some
here
also
i
am
sincerely
proud
both
of
your
genius
and
of
your
glory
and
i
value
your
friendship
more
highly
than
most
either
of
my
literary
or
political
opinions
southey
ellis
and
wordsworth
erskine
heber
and
other
friends
wrote
congratulatory
letters
about
marmion
with
slight
allusions
to
minor
blemishes
lockhart
thought
that
it
was
on
the
whole
the
greatest
of
scott
poems
in
strength
and
boldness
most
critics
regarded
the
long
introduction
to
each
canto
as
a
defect
since
it
broke
the
continuity
of
the
narrative
but
it
may
at
least
be
said
that
these
preludes
give
an
interesting
insight
into
the
author
moods
and
views
the
opinions
of
literary
men
of
course
differ
as
to
the
relative
excellence
of
the
different
poems
marmion
certainly
had
great
merit
and
added
to
the
fame
of
the
author
there
is
here
more
variety
of
metre
than
in
his
other
poems
and
also
some
passages
of
such
beauty
as
to
make
the
poem
immortal
like
the
death
of
marmion
and
those
familiar
lines
in
reference
to
clara
constancy
o
woman
in
our
hours
of
ease
uncertain
coy
and
hard
to
please
and
variable
as
the
shade
by
the
light
quivering
aspen
made
when
pain
and
anguish
wring
the
brow
a
ministering
angel
thou
the
sale
of
marmion
ultimately
reached
fifty
thousand
copies
in
great
britain
the
poem
was
originally
published
in
a
luxurious
quarto
at
and
shillings
besides
one
thousand
guineas
in
advance
half
the
profits
went
to
scott
and
must
have
reached
several
thousand
pounds
a
great
sale
when
we
remember
that
it
was
confined
to
libraries
and
people
of
wealth
in
america
the
poem
was
sold
for
two
or
three
shillings
less
than
of
what
it
cost
the
english
reader
a
successful
poem
or
novel
in
england
is
more
remunerative
to
the
author
from
the
high
price
at
which
it
is
published
than
in
the
united
states
where
prices
are
lower
and
royalties
rarely
exceed
ten
per
cent
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
however
that
in
england
editions
are
ordinarily
very
small
sometimes
consisting
of
not
more
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
copies
the
first
edition
of
marmion
was
only
of
two
thousand
copies
the
largest
edition
published
was
in
of
five
thousand
copies
octavo
but
even
this
did
not
circulate
largely
among
the
people
the
popularity
of
scott
in
england
was
confined
chiefly
to
the
upper
classes
at
least
until
the
copyright
of
his
books
had
expired
the
booksellers
were
not
slow
in
availing
themselves
of
popularity
they
employed
him
to
edit
an
edition
of
swift
for
and
tried
to
induce
him
to
edit
a
general
edition
of
english
poets
that
scheme
was
abandoned
in
consequence
of
a
disagreement
between
scott
and
murray
the
london
publisher
as
to
the
selection
of
poets
i
think
the
quarrels
of
authors
eighty
or
one
hundred
years
ago
with
their
publishers
were
more
frequent
than
they
are
in
these
times
we
read
of
a
long
alienation
between
scott
and
constable
the
publisher
who
enjoyed
a
sort
of
monopoly
of
the
poet
contributions
to
literature
constable
soon
after
found
a
great
rival
in
murray
who
was
at
this
time
an
obscure
london
bookseller
in
fleet
street
both
these
great
publishers
were
remarkable
for
sagacity
and
were
bold
in
their
ventures
the
foundation
of
constable
wealth
was
laid
when
he
was
publishing
the
edinburgh
review
in
murray
started
the
quarterly
review
its
great
political
rival
with
the
aid
of
scott
who
wrote
many
of
its
most
valuable
articles
and
william
gilford
satirist
and
critic
became
its
first
editor
growing
out
of
the
quarrel
between
scott
and
constable
was
the
establishment
of
john
ballantyne
as
publishers
and
booksellers
in
edinburgh
shortly
after
the
establishment
of
the
quarterly
review
as
a
tory
journal
scott
began
his
third
great
poem
the
lady
of
the
lake
which
was
published
in
in
all
the
majesty
of
a
quarto
at
the
price
of
two
guineas
a
copy
he
received
for
it
two
thousand
guineas
the
first
edition
of
two
thousand
copies
disappeared
at
once
and
was
followed
the
same
year
by
four
octavo
editions
in
a
few
months
the
sale
reached
twenty
thousand
copies
the
poem
received
great
commendation
both
from
the
quarterly
and
the
edinburgh
review
ellis
in
his
article
in
the
quarterly
thus
wrote
there
is
nothing
in
scott
of
the
severe
majesty
of
milton
or
of
the
terse
composition
of
pope
or
the
elaborate
elegance
of
campbell
or
the
flowing
and
redundant
diction
of
southey
but
there
is
a
medley
of
bright
images
and
a
diction
tinged
successively
with
the
careless
richness
of
shakespeare
the
antique
simplicity
of
the
old
romances
the
homeliness
of
vulgar
ballads
and
the
sentimental
glitter
of
the
most
modern
poetry
passing
from
the
borders
of
the
ludicrous
to
the
sublime
alternately
minute
and
energetic
sometimes
artificial
and
frequently
negligent
but
always
full
of
spirit
and
vivacity
abounding
in
images
that
are
striking
at
first
sight
to
minds
of
every
contexture
and
never
expressing
a
sentiment
which
it
can
cost
the
most
ordinary
reader
any
exertion
to
comprehend
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
fair
criticism
although
the
lucidity
of
scott
poetry
is
not
that
which
is
most
admired
by
modern
critics
fashion
in
these
times
delights
in
what
is
obscure
and
difficult
to
be
understood
as
if
depth
and
profundity
must
necessarily
be
unintelligible
to
ordinary
readers
in
scott
time
however
the
fashion
was
different
and
the
popularity
of
his
poems
became
almost
universal
however
there
are
the
same
fire
vivacity
and
brilliant
coloring
in
all
three
of
these
masterpieces
as
they
were
regarded
two
generations
ago
reminding
one
of
the
witchery
of
ariosto
yet
there
is
no
great
variety
in
these
poems
such
as
we
find
in
byron
no
great
force
of
passion
or
depth
of
sentiment
but
a
sort
of
harmonious
rhythm
more
highly
prized
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
century
than
in
the
latter
since
wordsworth
and
tennyson
have
made
us
familiar
with
what
is
deeper
and
richer
as
well
as
more
artistic
in
language
and
versification
but
no
one
has
denied
scott
originality
and
high
merits
in
contrast
with
the
pompous
tameness
and
conventionality
of
the
poetry
which
arose
when
johnson
was
the
oracle
of
literary
circles
and
which
still
held
the
stage
in
scott
day
even
scott
admirers
however
like
canning
and
ellis
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
they
would
like
something
different
from
anything
he
had
already
written
but
this
was
not
to
be
and
perhaps
the
reason
why
he
soon
after
gave
up
writing
poetry
was
the
conviction
that
his
genius
as
a
poet
did
not
lie
in
variety
and
richness
either
of
style
or
matter
his
great
fame
was
earned
by
his
novels
one
thing
greatly
surprises
me
scott
regarded
joanna
baillie
as
the
greatest
poetical
genius
of
that
day
and
be
derived
more
pleasure
from
reading
johnson
london
and
the
vanity
of
human
wishes
than
from
any
other
poetical
composition
indeed
there
is
nothing
more
remarkable
in
literary
history
than
scott
admiration
of
poetry
inferior
to
his
own
and
his
extraordinary
modesty
in
the
estimate
of
his
own
productions
most
poets
are
known
for
their
morbid
vanity
their
their
feeling
of
superiority
and
their
depreciation
of
superior
excellence
but
scott
had
eminently
a
healthy
mind
as
he
had
a
healthy
body
and
shrank
from
exaggeration
as
he
did
from
vulgarity
in
all
its
forms
it
is
probable
that
his
own
estimate
of
his
poetry
was
nearer
the
truth
than
that
of
his
admirers
who
were
naturally
inclined
to
be
partial
there
has
been
so
much
poetry
written
since
the
lady
of
the
lake
was
published
not
only
by
celebrated
poets
like
wordsworth
southey
moore
byron
campbell
keats
shelley
tennyson
browning
longfellow
lowell
whittier
bryant
but
also
by
many
minor
authors
that
the
standard
is
now
much
higher
than
it
was
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
much
of
that
which
then
was
regarded
as
very
fine
is
now
smiled
at
by
the
critics
and
neglected
by
cultivated
readers
generally
and
scott
has
not
escaped
unfavorable
criticism
it
has
been
my
object
to
present
the
subject
of
this
lecture
historically
rather
than
critically
to
show
the
extraordinary
popularity
of
scott
as
a
poet
among
his
contemporaries
rather
than
to
estimate
his
merit
at
the
present
time
i
confess
that
most
of
marmion
as
also
of
the
lady
of
the
lake
is
tame
to
me
and
deficient
in
high
poetic
genius
doubtless
we
are
all
influenced
by
the
standards
of
our
own
time
and
the
advances
making
in
literature
as
well
as
in
science
and
art
yet
this
change
in
the
opinions
of
critics
does
not
apply
to
byron
childe
harold
which
is
as
much
if
not
as
widely
admired
now
as
when
it
was
first
published
we
think
as
highly
too
of
the
deserted
village
the
elegy
in
a
country
churchyard
and
the
cotter
saturday
night
as
our
fathers
did
and
men
now
think
much
more
highly
of
the
merits
of
shakspeare
than
they
have
at
any
period
since
he
lived
so
that
after
all
there
is
an
element
in
true
poetry
which
does
not
lose
by
time
in
another
hundred
years
the
verdicts
of
critics
as
to
the
greater
part
of
the
poems
of
tennyson
wordsworth
browning
and
longfellow
may
be
very
different
from
what
they
now
are
while
some
of
their
lyrics
may
be
as
they
are
now
pronounced
immortal
poetry
is
both
an
inspiration
and
an
art
the
greater
part
of
that
which
is
now
produced
is
made
not
born
those
daintily
musical
and
elaborate
measures
which
are
now
the
fashion
because
they
claim
novelty
or
reproduce
the
quaintness
of
an
art
so
old
as
to
be
practically
new
perhaps
will
soon
again
be
forgotten
or
derided
what
is
simple
natural
appealing
to
the
heart
rather
than
to
the
head
may
last
when
more
pretentious
poetry
shall
have
passed
away
neither
criticism
nor
contemporary
popularity
can
decide
such
questions
scott
himself
seemed
to
take
a
true
view
in
a
letter
to
miss
seward
he
said
the
immortality
of
poetry
is
not
so
firm
a
point
in
my
creed
as
the
immortality
of
the
soul
lived
too
long
and
seen
the
death
of
much
immortal
song
nay
those
that
have
really
attained
their
literary
immortality
have
gained
it
under
very
hard
conditions
to
some
it
has
not
attached
till
after
death
to
others
it
has
been
the
means
of
lauding
personal
vices
and
follies
which
had
otherwise
been
unremembered
in
their
epitaphs
and
all
enjoy
the
same
immortality
under
a
condition
similar
to
that
of
noureddin
in
an
eastern
tale
noureddin
you
remember
was
to
enjoy
the
gift
of
immortality
but
with
this
qualification
that
he
was
subjected
to
long
naps
of
forty
fifty
or
a
hundred
years
at
a
time
even
so
homer
and
virgil
slumbered
through
whole
centuries
shakspeare
himself
enjoyed
undisturbed
sleep
from
the
age
of
charles
until
garrick
waked
him
dryden
fame
has
nodded
that
of
pope
begins
to
be

chaucer
is
as
sound
as
a
top
and
spenser
is
snoring
in
the
midst
of
his
commentators
milton
indeed
is
quite
awake
but
observe
he
was
at
his
very
outset
refreshed
with
a
nap
of
and
in
the
midst
of
all
this
we
sons
of
degeneracy
talk
of
immortality
let
me
please
my
own
generation
and
let
those
who
come
after
us
judge
of
their
facts
and
my
performances
as
they
please
the
anticipation
of
their
neglect
or
censure
will
affect
me
very
little
in
the
was
rewarded
with
the
salary
of
a
place
whose
duties
he
had
for
some
years
performed
without
pay
that
of
clerk
of
sessions
worth
per
annum
thus
having
now
about
as
an
income
independently
of
his
earnings
by
the
pen
scott
gave
up
his
practice
as
an
advocate
and
devoted
himself
entirely
to
literature
at
the
same
time
he
bought
a
farm
of
somewhat
more
than
a
hundred
acres
on
the
banks
of
the
beautiful
tweed
about
five
miles
from
ashestiel
and
leaving
to
its
owners
the
pretty
place
in
which
he
had
for
six
years
enjoyed
life
and
work
he
removed
to
the
cottage
at
abbotsford
for
thus
he
named
his
new
purchase
in
memory
of
the
abbots
of
melrose
who
formerly
owned
all
the
region
and
the
ruins
of
whose
lovely
abbey
stood
not
far
away
of
the
for
this
purchase
half
was
borrowed
from
his
brother
and
the
other
half
on
the
pledge
of
the
profits
of
a
poem
that
was
projected
but
not
written
rokeby
scott
ought
to
have
been
content
with
ashestiel
or
since
every
man
wishes
to
own
his
home
he
should
have
been
satisfied
with
the
comfortable
cottage
which
he
built
at
abbotsford
and
the
modest
improvements
that
his
love
for
trees
and
shrubs
enabled
him
to
make
but
his
aspirations
led
him
into
serious
difficulties
with
all
his
sagacity
and
good
sense
scott
never
seemed
to
know
when
he
was
well
off
it
was
a
fatal
mistake
both
for
his
fame
and
happiness
to
attempt
to
compete
with
those
who
are
called
great
in
england
and
scotland
that
is
peers
and
vast
landed
proprietors
he
was
not
alone
in
this
error
for
it
has
generally
been
the
ambition
of
fortunate
authors
to
acquire
social
as
well
as
literary
distinction
thus
paying
tribute
to
riches
and
virtually
abdicating
their
own
true
position
which
is
higher
than
any
that
rank
or
wealth
can
give
it
has
too
frequently
been
the
misfortune
of
literary
genius
to
bow
down
to
vulgar
idols
and
the
worldly
sentiments
which
this
idolatry
involves
are
seen
in
almost
every
fashionable
novel
which
has
appeared
for
a
hundred
years
in
no
country
is
this
melancholy
social
slavery
more
usual
than
in
england
with
all
its
political
freedom
although
there
are
noble
exceptions
the
only
great
flaw
in
scott
character
was
this
homage
to
rank
and
wealth
on
the
other
hand
rank
and
wealth
also
paid
homage
to
him
as
a
man
of
genius
both
scotland
and
england
received
him
into
the
most
select
circles
not
only
of
their
literary
and
political
but
of
their
fashionable
life
in
scott
published
the
lord
of
the
isles
and
in
rokeby
neither
of
which
was
remarkable
for
either
literary
or
commercial
success
although
both
were
well
received
in
he
edited
a
edition
of
dean
swift
works
with
a
life
and
in
the
same
year
began
almost
by
accident
the
real
work
of
his
own
career
in
waverley
if
public
opinion
is
far
different
from
what
it
was
in
time
in
reference
to
his
poetry
we
observe
the
same
change
in
regard
to
the
source
of
his
widest
fame
his
novels
but
not
to
so
marked
a
degree
for
it
was
in
fiction
that
scott
great
gifts
had
their
full
fruition
many
a
fine
intellect
still
delights
in
his
novels
though
cultivated
readers
and
critics
differ
as
to
their
comparative
merits
no
two
persons
will
unite
in
their
opinions
as
to
the
three
of
those
productions
which
they
like
most
or
least
it
is
so
with
all
famous
novels
then
too
what
man
of
seventy
will
agree
with
a
man
of
thirty
as
to
the
comparative
merits
of
scott
dickens
thackeray

how
few
read
uncle
tom
cabin
compared
with
the
multitudes
who
read
that
most
powerful
and
popular
book
forty
years
ago
how
changing
if
not
transient
is
the
fame
of
the
novelist
as
well
as
of
the
poet
with
reference
to
him
even
the
same
generation
changes
its
tastes
what
filled
us
with
delight
as
young
men
or
women
of
twenty
is
at
fifty
spurned
with
contempt
or
thrown
aside
with
indifference
no
books
ever
filled
my
mind
and
soul
with
the
delight
i
had
when
at
twelve
years
of
age
i
read
the
children
of
the
abbey
and
thaddeus
of
warsaw
what
man
of
eighty
can
forget
the
enthusiasm
with
which
he
read
old
mortality
or
ivanhoe
when
he
was
in
college
perhaps
one
test
of
a
great
book
is
the
pleasure
derived
from
reading
it
over
and
over
again
as
we
read
don
quixote
or
the
dramas
of
shakspeare
of
whose
infinite
variety
we
never
tire
measured
by
this
test
the
novels
of
sir
walter
scott
are
among
the
foremost
works
of
fiction
which
have
appeared
in
our
world
they
will
not
all
retain
their
popularity
from
generation
to
generation
like
don
quixote
or
the
pilgrim
progress
or
the
vicar
of
wakefield
but
these
are
single
productions
of
their
authors
while
not
a
few
of
scott
many
novels
are
certainly
still
read
by
cultivated
people
if
not
with
the
same
interest
they
excited
when
first
published
yet
with
profit
and
admiration
they
have
some
excellencies
which
are
immortal
elevation
of
sentiment
chivalrous
regard
for
women
fascination
of
narrative
after
one
has
waded
through
the
learned
historical
introductory
chapters
the
absence
of
exaggeration
the
vast
variety
of
characters
introduced
and
vividly
maintained
and
above
all
the
freshness
and
originality
of
description
both
of
nature
and
of
man
among
the
severest
and
most
bigoted
of
new
england
puritans
none
could
find
anything
corrupting
or
demoralizing
in
his
romances
whereas
byron
and
bulwer
were
never
mentioned
without
a
shudder
and
even
shakspeare
was
locked
up
in
as
unfit
for
young
people
to
read
and
not
particularly
creditable
for
anybody
to
own
the
unfavorable
comments
which
the
most
orthodox
ever
made
upon
scott
were
as
to
the
repulsiveness
of
the
old
covenanters
as
he
described
them
and
his
sneers
at
puritan
perfections
scott
however
had
contempt
not
for
the
puritans
but
for
many
of
their
peculiarities
especially
for
their
cant
when
it
degenerated
into
hypocrisy
one
thing
is
certain
that
no
works
of
fiction
have
had
such
universal
popularity
both
in
england
and
america
for
so
long
a
period
as
the
waverley
novels
scott
reigned
as
the
undisputed
monarch
of
the
realm
of
fiction
and
romance
for
years
he
gave
undiminished
entertainment
to
an
entire
generation
and
not
that
merely
but
instruction
in
his
historical
novels
although
his
views
were
not
always
correct
as
whose
ever
are
he
who
could
charm
millions
of
readers
learned
and
unlearned
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
must
have
possessed
remarkable
genius
indeed
he
was
not
only
the
central
figure
in
english
literature
for
a
generation
but
he
was
regarded
as
peculiarly
original
another
style
of
novels
may
obtain
more
passing
favor
with
modern
readers
but
scott
was
justly
famous
his
works
are
in
every
library
and
form
a
delightful
part
of
the
education
of
every
youth
and
maiden
who
cares
to
read
at
all
and
he
will
as
a
novelist
probably
live
after
some
who
are
now
prime
favorites
will
be
utterly
forgotten
or
ignored
about
bulwer
was
in
his
early
successes
about
dickens
was
the
rage
of
his
day
about
thackeray
had
taken
his
high
grade
and
it
was
about
that
george
eliot
power
appeared
these
still
retain
their
own
peculiar
lines
of
popularity
bulwer
with
the
romantic
few
thackeray
with
the
appreciative
intelligent
george
eliot
with
a
still
wider
clientage
and
dickens
with
everybody
on
account
of
his
appeal
to
the
universal
sentiments
of
comedy
and
pathos
scott
influence
somewhat
checked
during
the
growth
of
these
reputations
and
the
succession
of
fertile
and
accomplished
writers
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
including
the
introspective
analysts
of
the
past
fifteen
years
has
within
a
decade
been
rising
again
and
has
lately
burst
forth
in
a
new
group
of
historical
romancers
who
seem
to
have
harked
back
from
the
subjective
fad
of
our
day
to
scott
healthy
adventurous
objectivity
not
only
so
but
new
editions
of
the
waverley
novels
are
coming
one
by
one
from
the
shrewd
publishers
who
keep
track
of
the
popular
taste
one
of
the
most
attractive
being
issued
in
edinburgh
at
a
volume
the
first
of
scott
remarkable
series
of
novels
waverley
published
in
when
the
author
was
years
of
age
and
at
the
height
of
his
fame
as
a
poet
took
the
fashionable
and
literary
world
by
storm
the
novel
had
been
partly
written
for
several
years
but
was
laid
aside
as
his
edition
of
swift
and
his
essays
for
the
supplement
of
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
and
other
prose
writings
employed
all
the
time
he
had
to
spare
this
was
done
by
scott
without
enthusiasm
to
earn
money
for
his
investment
in
real
estate
and
is
not
of
transcendent
merit
obscurer
men
than
he
had
performed
such
literary
drudgery
with
more
ability
but
no
writer
was
ever
more
industrious
the
amount
of
work
which
he
accomplished
at
this
period
was
prodigious
especially
when
we
remember
that
his
duties
as
sheriff
and
clerk
of
sessions
occupied
eight
months
of
the
year
he
was
more
familiar
with
the
literary
history
of
queen
anne
reign
than
any
subsequent
historian
if
we
except
macaulay
whose
brilliant
career
had
not
yet
begun
he
took
of
course
a
different
view
of
swift
from
the
writers
of
the
edinburgh
review
and
was
probably
too
favorable
in
his
description
of
the
personal
character
of
the
dean
of
patrick
who
is
now
generally
regarded
as
inordinately
ambitious
arrogant
and
selfish
of
a
morose
vindictive
and
haughty
temper
utterly
destitute
of
generosity
and
magnanimity
as
well
as
of
tenderness
fidelity
and
compassion
lord
jeffrey
in
his
review
attacked
swift
moral
character
with
such
consummate
ability
as
to
check
materially
the
popularity
of
his
writings
which
are
universally
admitted
to
be
full
of
genius
his
superb
intellect
and
his
morality
present
a
sad
contrast
as
in
the
cases
of
bacon
burns
and
byron
which
scott
on
account
of
the
force
of
his
tory
prejudices
did
not
sufficiently
point
out
but
as
to
the
novel
when
it
suddenly
appeared
it
is
not
surprising
that
waverley
should
at
once
have
attained
an
unexampled
popularity
when
we
consider
the
mediocrity
of
all
works
of
fiction
at
that
time
if
we
except
the
irish
tales
of
maria
edgeworth
scott
received
from
constable
for
this
romance
then
deemed
a
very
liberal
remuneration
for
what
cost
him
but
a
few
months
work
the
second
and
third
volumes
were
written
in
one
month
he
wrote
with
remarkable
rapidity
when
his
mind
was
full
of
the
subject
and
his
previous
studies
as
an
antiquary
and
as
a
collector
of
scottish
poetry
and
legends
fitted
him
for
his
work
which
was
in
no
sense
a
task
but
a
most
lively
pleasure
it
is
not
known
why
scott
published
this
strikingly
original
work
anonymously
perhaps
it
was
because
of
his
unusual
modesty
and
the
fear
that
he
might
lose
the
popularity
he
had
already
enjoyed
as
a
poet
but
it
immediately
placed
him
on
a
higher
literary
elevation
since
it
was
generally
suspected
that
he
was
the
author
he
could
not
altogether
disguise
himself
from
the
keen
eyes
of
jeffrey
and
other
critics
the
book
was
received
as
a
revelation
the
first
volume
is
not
particularly
interesting
but
the
story
continually
increases
in
interest
to
its
close
it
is
not
a
dissection
of
the
human
heart
it
is
not
even
much
of
a
but
a
most
vivid
narrative
without
startling
situations
or
adventures
its
great
charm
is
its
quiet
humor
not
strained
into
witty
expressions
which
provoke
laughter
but
a
sort
of
amiable
delineation
of
the
character
of
a
born
gentleman
with
his
weaknesses
and
prejudices
all
leaning
to
virtue
side
it
is
a
description
of
manners
peculiar
to
the
scottish
gentry
in
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
especially
among
the
jacobite
families
then
passing
away
of
course
the
popularity
of
this
novel
at
that
time
was
chiefly
confined
to
the
upper
classes
in
the
first
place
the
people
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
price
of
the
book
and
secondly
it
was
outside
their
sympathies
and
knowledge
indeed
i
doubt
if
any
commonplace
person
without
culture
or
extended
knowledge
can
enjoy
so
refined
a
work
with
so
many
learned
allusions
and
such
exquisite
humor
which
appeals
to
a
knowledge
of
the
world
in
its
higher
aspects
it
is
one
of
the
last
books
that
an
ignorant
young
lady
brought
up
on
the
trash
of
ordinary
fiction
would
relish
or
comprehend
whoever
turns
uninterested
from
waverley
is
probably
unable
to
see
its
excellencies
or
enjoy
its
peculiar
charms
it
is
not
a
book
for
a
modern
or
but
for
a
man
or
woman
in
the
highest
maturity
of
mind
with
a
poetic
or
imaginative
nature
and
with
a
leaning
perhaps
to
aristocratic
sentiments
it
is
a
rebuke
to
vulgarity
and
ignorance
which
the
minute
and
exaggerated
descriptions
of
low
life
in
the
pages
of
dickens
certainly
are
not
in
february
guy
mannering
was
published
the
second
in
the
series
of
the
waverley
novels
and
was
received
by
the
intelligent
reading
classes
with
even
more
than
waverley
to
which
it
is
superior
in
many
respects
it
plunges
at
once
medias
without
the
long
and
labored
introductory
chapters
of
its
predecessor
it
is
interesting
from
first
to
last
and
is
an
elaborate
and
tale
written
when
scott
was
in
the
maturity
of
his
powers
it
is
full
of
incident
and
is
delightful
in
humor
its
chief
excellence
is
in
the
loftiness
of
its
sentiments
being
one
of
the
healthiest
and
wholesomest
novels
ever
written
appealing
to
the
heart
as
well
as
to
the
intellect
to
be
read
over
and
over
again
like
the
vicar
of
wakefield
without
weariness
it
may
be
too
aristocratic
in
its
tone
to
please
everybody
but
it
portrays
the
sentiments
of
its
age
in
reference
to
squires
and
scottish
lairds
who
were
more
distinguished
for
uprightness
and
manly
duties
than
for
brains
and
culture
the
fascination
with
which
scott
always
depicts
the
virtues
of
hospitality
and
trust
in
humanity
makes
a
strong
impression
on
the
imagination
his
heroes
and
heroines
are
not
remarkable
for
genius
but
shine
in
the
higher
glories
of
domestic
affection
and
fidelity
to
trusts
two
characters
in
particular
are
original
creations
dominie
sampson
and
meg
merrilies
whom
no
reader
can
forget
the
one
ludicrous
for
his
simplicity
and
the
other
a
gypsy
woman
weird
and
strange
more
like
a
witch
than
a
sibyl
but
intensely
human
and
capable
of
the
strongest
attachment
for
those
she
loved
the
easy
and
transparent
flow
of
the
style
of
this
novel
its
beautiful
simplicity
the
wild
magnificence
of
its
sketches
of
scenery
the
rapid
and
ever
brightening
interest
of
the
narrative
the
unaffected
kindness
of
feeling
the
manly
purity
of
thought
everywhere
mingled
with
a
gentle
humor
and
homely
sagacity
but
above
all
the
rich
variety
and
skilful
contrast
of
character
and
manners
at
once
fresh
in
fiction
and
stamped
with
the
unforgeable
seal
of
truth
and
nature
spoke
to
every
heart
and
mind
and
the
few
murmurs
of
pedantic
criticism
were
lost
in
the
voice
of
general
delight
which
never
fails
to
welcome
the
invention
that
introduces
to
the
sympathy
of
the
imagination
a
new
group
of
immortal
realities
scott
received
about
for
this
favorite
romance
one
entirely
new
in
the
realm
of
fiction
which
enabled
him
to
pay
off
his
most
pressing
debts
and
indulge
his
taste
for
travel
he
visited
the
field
of
waterloo
and
became
a
social
lion
in
both
paris
and
london
the
prince
of
wales
sent
him
a
magnificent
set
with
diamonds
and
entertained
him
with
admiring
cordiality
at
carlton
house
for
his
authorship
of
waverley
was
more
than
surmised
while
his
fame
as
a
poet
was
second
only
to
that
of
byron
then
in
the
spring
of
took
place
the
first
meeting
of
these
two
great
bards
and
their
successive
interviews
were
graced
with
mutual
compliments
scott
did
not
think
that
byron
reading
was
extensive
either
in
poetry
or
history
in
which
opinion
the
industrious
scottish
bard
was
mistaken
but
he
did
justice
ta
byron
transcendent
genius
and
with
more
charity
than
severity
mourned
over
his
departure
from
virtue
after
a
series
of
brilliant
banquets
at
the
houses
of
the
great
both
of
rank
and
of
fame
scott
returned
to
his
native
land
to
renew
his
varied
and
exhausting
labors
having
furnished
his
publishers
with
a
volume
of
letters
on
the
subjects
which
most
interested
him
during
his
short
tour
everything
he
touched
now
brought
him
gold
paul
letters
to
his
kinsfolk
as
he
called
this
volume
concerning
his
tour
was
well
received
but
not
with
the
enthusiasm
which
marked
the
publication
of
guy
mannering
indeed
it
had
no
special
claim
to
distinction
the
antiquary
followed
in
may
of
the
next
year
and
though
it
lacked
the
romance
of
waverley
and
the
adventure
of
guy
mannering
it
had
even
a
larger
sale
scott
himself
regarded
it
as
superior
to
both
but
an
author
is
not
always
the
best
judge
of
his
own
productions
and
we
do
not
accept
his
criticism
it
probably
cost
him
more
labor
but
it
is
an
exhibition
of
his
erudition
rather
than
a
revelation
of
himself
or
of
nature
it
is
certainly
very
learned
but
learning
does
not
make
a
book
popular
nor
is
a
work
of
fiction
the
place
for
a
display
of
learning
if
the
antiquary
were
published
in
these
times
it
would
be
pronounced
pedantic
readers
are
apt
to
skip
names
and
learned
allusions
and
scraps
of
latin
as
a
story
i
think
it
inferior
to
guy
mannering
although
it
has
great
merits
a
kind
of
simple
unsought
charm
and
is
a
transcript
of
actual
scottish
life
it
had
a
great
success
scott
says
in
a
letter
to
his
friend
terry
it
is
at
press
again
six
thousand
having
been
sold
in
six
days
before
the
novel
was
finished
the
author
had
already
projected
his
tales
of
my
landlord
scott
was
now
at
the
of
his
creative
power
and
his
industry
was
as
remarkable
as
his
genius
there
was
but
little
doubt
in
the
public
mind
as
to
the
paternity
of
the
waverley
novels
and
whatever
scott
wrote
was
sure
to
have
a
large
sale
so
that
every
publisher
of
note
was
eager
to
have
a
hand
in
bringing
his
productions
before
the
public
in
appeared
the
edinburgh
annual
register
containing
scott
sketch
of
the
year
which
though
very
good
showed
that
the
author
was
less
happy
in
history
than
in
fiction
the
first
series
of
tales
of
my
landlord
was
published
by
murray
and
not
by
constable
who
had
brought
out
scott
other
works
and
the
book
was
received
with
unbounded
enthusiasm
many
critics
place
old
mortality
in
the
highest
niche
of
merit
and
fame
frere
of
the
quarterly
review
hallam
boswell
lamb
lord
holland
all
agreed
that
it
surpassed
his
other
novels
bishop
heber
said
there
are
only
two
men
in
the
world
walter
scott
and
lord
byron
lockhart
regarded
old
mortality
as
the
marmion
of
scott
novels
but
the
painting
of
the
covenanters
gave
offence
to
the
more
rigid
of
the
presbyterians
for
myself
i
have
doubt
as
to
the
correctness
of
their
criticisms
old
mortality
in
contrast
with
the
previous
novels
of
scott
has
a
place
similar
to
the
later
productions
of
george
eliot
as
compared
with
her
earlier
ones
it
is
not
so
vivid
a
sketch
of
scotch
life
as
is
given
in
guy
mannering
like
the
antiquary
it
is
bookish
rather
than
natural
from
a
literary
point
of
view
it
is
more
artistic
than
guy
mannering
and
more
learned
the
canvas
is
a
broader
one
its
characters
are
portrayed
with
great
skill
and
power
but
they
lack
the
freshness
which
comes
from
actual
contact
with
the
people
described
and
with
whom
scott
was
familiar
as
a
youth
in
the
course
of
his
wanderings
it
is
more
historical
than
realistic
in
short
old
mortality
is
another
creation
of
its
author
brain
rather
than
a
painting
of
real
life
but
it
is
justly
famous
for
it
was
the
precursor
of
those
brilliant
historical
romances
from
which
so
much
is
learned
of
great
men
already
known
to
students
it
was
a
new
departure
in
literature
before
scott
arose
historical
novels
were
comparatively
unknown
he
made
romance
instructive
rather
than
merely
amusing
and
added
the
charm
of
life
to
the
dry
annals
of
the
past
cervantes
does
not
portray
a
single
great
character
known
in
spanish
history
in
his
don
quixote
but
he
paints
life
as
he
has
seen
it
so
does
goldsmith
so
does
george
eliot
in
silas
marner
she
presents
life
indeed
in
romola
not
however
as
she
had
personally
observed
it
but
as
drawn
from
books
recreating
the
atmosphere
of
a
long
gone
time
by
the
power
of
imagination
the
earlier
works
of
scott
are
drawn
from
memory
and
personal
feeling
rather
than
from
the
knowledge
he
had
gained
by
study
of
old
mortality
he
writes
to
lady
louisa
stuart
i
am
complete
master
of
the
whole
history
of
these
strange
times
both
of
persecutors
and
persecuted
so
i
trust
i
have
come
decently
off
the
divisional
grouping
of
these
earlier
novels
by
scott
himself
is
interesting
in
the
advertisement
to
the
antiquary
he
says
the
present
work
completes
a
series
of
fictitious
narratives
intended
to
illustrate
the
manners
of
scotland
at
three
different
periods
waverley
embraced
the
age
of
our
fathers
tis
sixty
years
since
guy
mannering
that
of
our
own
youth
and
the
antiquary
refers
to
the
last
ten
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
dedication
of
tales
of
my
landlord
describes
them
as
tales
illustrative
of
ancient
scottish
manners
and
of
the
traditions
of
their
his
countrymen
respective
districts
they
were
the
black
dwarf
and
old

series
the
heart
of
series
the
bride
of
lammermoor
and
a
legend
of
montrose
series
count
robert
of

and

these
all
except
the
fourth

appeared
in

six
years
from
to
and
besides
these
rob

ivanhoe
and
the
monastery
with
the
publication
of
old
mortality
in
then
scott
introduced
the
first
of
his
historical
novels
which
had
great
fascination
for
students
who
ever
painted
the
old
cameronian
with
more
felicity
who
ever
described
the
peculiarities
of
the
scottish
calvinists
during
the
reign
of
the
last
of
the
stuarts
with
more
truthfulness
their
severity
their
strict
and
judaical
observance
of
the
sabbath
their
hostility
to
popular
amusements
their
rigid
and
legal
morality
their
love
of
theological
dogmas
their
inflexible
prejudices
their
lofty
aspirations
where
shall
we
find
in
literature
a
sterner
fanatical
puritan
than
john
balfour
of
burley
or
a
fiercer
royalist
than
graham
of
claverhouse
as
a
this
novel
is
not
remarkable
it
is
not
in
the
description
of
passionate
love
that
scott
anywhere
excels
his
heroines
with
two
or
three
exceptions
would
be
called
rather
tame
by
the
modern
reader
although
they
win
respect
for
their
domestic
virtues
and
sterling
elements
of
character
his
favorite
heroes
are
either
englishmen
of
good
family
or
scotchmen
educated
in
england
gallant
cultivated
and
reproachless
but
without
any
striking
originality
or
intellectual
force
rob
roy
was
published
in
the
latter
part
of
and
was
received
by
the
public
with
the
same
unabated
enthusiasm
which
marked
the
appearance
of
guy
mannering
and
the
other
romances
an
edition
of
ten
thousand
was
disposed
of
in
two
weeks
and
the
subsequent
sale
amounted
to
forty
thousand
more
the
scene
of
this
story
is
laid
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
with
an
english
hero
and
a
scottish
heroine
and
in
this
fascinating
work
the
political
history
of
the
times
forty
years
earlier
than
the
period
of
waverley
is
portrayed
with
great
impartiality
it
is
a
description
of
the
first
jacobite
rising
against
george
in
the
year
in
this
novel
one
of
the
greatest
of
scott
creations
appears
in
the
heroine
diana
vernon
rather
wild
and
masculine
but
interesting
from
her
courage
and
virtue
the
character
of
baillie
jarvie
is
equally
original
and
more
amusing
the
general
effect
of
rob
roy
as
well
as
of
waverley
and
old
mortality
was
to
make
the
scottish
highlanders
and
jacobites
interesting
to
english
readers
of
opposite
views
and
feelings
without
arousing
hostility
to
the
reigning
royal
family
the
highlanders
a
hundred
years
ago
were
viewed
by
the
english
with
sentiments
nearly
similar
to
those
with
which
the
puritan
settlers
of
new
england
looked
upon
the
indians
at
any
rate
as
freebooters
robbers
and
murderers
who
were
dangerous
to
civilization
and
the
severities
of
the
english
government
toward
these
lawless
clans
both
as
outlaws
and
as
foes
of
the
hanoverian
succession
were
generally
condoned
by
public
opinion
scott
succeeded
in
producing
a
better
feeling
among
both
the
conquerors
and
the
conquered
he
modified
general
sentiment
by
his
impartial
and
liberal
views
and
allayed
prejudices
the
highlanders
thenceforth
were
regarded
as
a
body
of
men
with
many
interesting
traits
and
capable
of
becoming
good
subjects
of
the
crown
while
their
own
hatred
and
contempt
of
the
lowland
saxon
were
softened
by
the
many
generous
and
romantic
incidents
of
these
tales
two
hitherto
hostile
races
were
drawn
into
neighborly
sympathy
travellers
visited
the
beautiful
highland
retreats
and
returned
with
enthusiastic
impressions
of
the
country
to
no
other
man
does
scotland
owe
so
great
a
debt
of
gratitude
as
to
walter
scott
not
only
for
his
poetry
and
novels
but
for
showing
the
admirable
traits
of
a
barren
country
and
a
fierce
population
and
contributing
to
bring
them
within
the
realm
of
civilization
a
century
or
two
ago
the
highlands
of
scotland
were
peopled
by
a
race
in
a
state
of
perpetual
conflict
with
civilization
averse
to
labor
gaining
except
such
of
them
as
were
enrolled
in
the
english
army
a
precarious
support
by
plunder
smuggling
and
other
illegal
pursuits
now
they
compose
a
body
of
intelligent
and
laborers
cultivating
farms
raising
cattle
and
sheep
and
pursuing
the
various
branches
of
industry
which
lead
to
independence
if
not
to
wealth
the
traveller
among
the
highlanders
feels
as
secure
and
is
made
as
comfortable
as
in
any
part
of
the
island
while
revelations
of
their
shrewd
intelligence
and
unsuspected
wit
in
the
stories
of
barrie
and
crockett
show
what
a
century
of
calvinistic
theology
as
the
chief
mental
stimulant
has
done
in
developing
blossoms
from
that
stock
scott
had
now
all
the
fame
and
worldly
prosperity
which
any
literary
man
could
attain
to
for
his
authorship
of
the
novels
although
unacknowledged
was
more
and
more
generally
believed
and
after
not
denied
he
lived
above
the
atmosphere
of
envy
honored
by
all
classes
of
people
surrounded
with
admiring
friends
and
visitors
he
had
an
income
of
at
least
a
year
wherever
he
journeyed
he
was
treated
with
the
greatest
distinction
in
london
he
was
cordially
received
as
a
distinguished
guest
in
any
circle
he
chose
the
highest
nobles
paid
homage
to
him
the
king
made
him
a
baronet
the
first
purely
literary
man
in
england
to
receive
that
honor
he
now
became
ambitious
to
increase
his
lands
and
the
hundred
acres
of
farm
at
abbotsford
were
enlarged
by
new
purchases
picturesquely
planted
with
trees
and
shrubberies
while
the
cottage
grew
to
a
mansion
and
the
mansion
to
a
castle
with
its
twelve
hundred
surrounding
acres
cultivated
and
made
beautiful
scott
correspondence
with
famous
people
was
immense
besides
his
other
labors
as
farmer
lawyer
and
author
few
persons
of
rank
or
fame
visited
edinburgh
without
paying
their
respects
to
its
most
eminent
citizen
his
country
house
was
invaded
by
tourists
he
was
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
some
of
the
proudest
nobles
of
scotland
his
various
works
were
the
daily
food
not
only
of
his
countrymen
but
of
all
educated
europe
station
power
wealth
beauty
and
genius
strove
with
each
other
in
every
demonstration
of
respect
and
worship
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
this
homage
and
increasing
prosperity
one
of
the
most
fortunate
of
human
beings
scott
head
was
not
turned
his
habitual
modesty
preserved
his
moral
health
amid
all
sorts
of
temptation
he
never
lost
his
intellectual
balance
he
assumed
no
airs
of
superiority
his
manners
were
simple
and
unpretending
to
the
last
he
praised
all
literary
productions
except
his
own
his
life
in
edinburgh
was
plain
though
hospitable
and
free
and
he
seemed
to
care
for
few
luxuries
aside
from
books
of
which
life
made
a
large
collection
the
furniture
of
his
houses
in
edinburgh
and
at
abbotsford
was
neither
showy
nor
luxurious
he
was
extraordinarily
fond
of
dogs
and
all
domestic
animals
who
sympathetic
creatures
as
they
are
unerringly
sought
him
out
and
lavished
affection
upon
him
when
scott
lived
in
castle
street
he
was
not
regarded
by
edinburgh
society
as
particularly
brilliant
in
conversation
since
he
never
aspired
to
lead
by
learned
disquisitions
he
told
stories
well
with
great
humor
and
pleasantry
to
amuse
rather
than
to
instruct
his
talk
was
almost
homely
the
most
noticeable
thing
about
it
was
lord
cockburn
said
of
him
that
his
sense
was
more
wonderful
than
his
genius
he
did
not
blaze
like
macaulay
or
mackintosh
at
the
nor
absorb
conversation
like
coleridge
and
sydney
smith
he
disliked
says
lockhart
mere
disquisitions
in
edinburgh
and
prepared
impromptus
in
london
a
in
society
was
to
him
an
abomination
hence
until
his
fame
was
established
by
the
admiration
of
the
world
edinburgh
professors
did
not
see
his
greatness
to
them
he
seemed
commonplace
but
not
to
such
men
as
hallam
or
moore
or
rogers
or
croker
or
canning
notwithstanding
scott
gave
great
dinners
occasionally
they
appear
to
have
been
a
bore
to
him
and
he
very
rarely
went
out
to
evening
entertainments
although
at
public
dinners
his
wit
and
sense
made
him
a
favorite
chairman
he
retired
early
at
night
and
rose
early
in
the
morning
and
his
severest
labors
were
before
breakfast
his
principal
meal
he
always
dined
at
home
on
sunday
with
a
few
intimate
friends
and
his
dinner
was
substantial
and
plain
he
drank
very
little
wine
and
preferred
a
glass
of
to
champagne
or
port
he
could
not
distinguish
between
madeira
and
sherry
he
was
neither
an
epicure
nor
a
gourmand
after
scott
had
become
his
happiest
hours
were
spent
in
enlarging
and
adorning
his
land
at
abbotsford
and
in
erecting
and
embellishing
his
baronial
castle
in
this
his
gains
were
more
than
absorbed
he
loved
that
castle
more
than
any
of
his
intellectual
creations
and
it
was
not
completed
until
nearly
all
his
novels
were
written
without
personal
extravagance
he
was
lavish
in
the
sums
he
spent
on
abbotsford
here
he
delighted
to
entertain
his
distinguished
visitors
of
whom
no
one
was
more
welcome
than
washington
irving
whom
he
liked
for
his
modesty
and
quiet
humor
and
unpretending
manners
lockhart
writes
it
would
hardly
i
believe
be
too
much
to
affirm
that
sir
walter
scott
entertained
under
his
roof
in
the
course
of
the
seven
or
eight
brilliant
seasons
when
his
prosperity
was
at
its
height
as
many
persons
of
distinction
in
rank
in
politics
in
art
in
literature
and
in
science
as
the
most
princely
nobleman
of
his
age
ever
did
in
the
like
space
of
time
one
more
unconscious
apparently
of
his
great
powers
has
been
rarely
seen
among
literary
men
especially
in
england
and
france
affording
a
striking
contrast
in
this
respect
to
dryden
pope
voltaire
byron
bulwer
macaulay
carlyle
hugo
dumas
and
even
tennyson
great
lawyers
and
great
statesmen
are
rarely
so
egotistical
and
conceited
as
poets
novelists
artists
and
preachers
scott
made
no
pretensions
which
were
offensive
or
which
could
be
controverted
his
greatest
aspiration
seems
to
have
been
to
be
a
respectable
landed
proprietor
and
to
found
a
family
an
english
country
gentleman
was
his
of
happiness
and
contentment
perhaps
this
was
a
weakness
but
it
was
certainly
a
harmless
and
amiable
one
and
not
so
offensive
as
intellectual
pride
scott
indeed
while
without
vanity
had
pride
but
it
was
of
a
lofty
kind
disdaining
meanness
and
cowardice
as
worse
even
than
transgressions
which
have
their
origin
in
unregulated
passions
from
the
numerous
expletives
which
abound
in
scott
letters
such
as
are
not
now
considered
in
good
taste
among
gentlemen
i
infer
that
like
most
gentlemen
of
his
social
standing
in
those
times
he
was
in
the
habit
of
using
when
highly
excited
or
irritated
what
is
called
profane
language
after
he
had
once
given
vent
to
his
feelings
however
he
was
amiable
and
forgiving
enough
for
a
christian
sage
who
never
harbored
malice
or
revenge
he
had
great
respect
for
the
military
profession
probably
because
it
was
the
great
prop
and
defence
of
government
and
established
institutions
for
he
was
the
most
conservative
of
aristocrats
and
yet
his
aristocratic
turn
of
mind
never
conflicted
with
his
humane
disposition
never
made
him
a
snob
he
abhorred
all
vulgarity
he
admired
genius
and
virtue
in
whatever
garb
they
appeared
he
was
as
kind
to
his
servants
and
to
poor
and
unfortunate
people
as
he
was
to
his
equals
in
society
being
eminently
it
was
only
fools
who
made
great
pretensions
that
he
despised
and
treated
with
contempt
no
doubt
scott
was
bored
by
the
numerous
visitors
whether
invited
or
uninvited
who
came
from
all
parts
of
great
britain
from
america
and
even
from
continental
europe
to
do
homage
to
his
genius
or
to
gratify
their
curiosity
sometimes
as
many
as
thirty
guests
sat
down
to
his
at
once
he
entertained
in
baronial
style
but
without
ostentation
or
prodigality
and
on
dishes
he
did
not
like
french
cooking
and
his
simple
taste
in
the
matters
of
beverage
we
have
already
noted
the
people
to
whom
he
was
most
attentive
were
the
representatives
of
ancient
families
whether
rich
or
poor
scott
was
very
kind
to
literary
men
in
misfortune
and
his
chosen
friends
were
authors
of
eminence
like
miss
edgeworth
joanna
baillie
thomas
moore
crabbe
southey
wordsworth
sir
humphry
davy
wollaston
the
chemist
henry
mackenzie
etc
he
was
very
intimate
with
the
duke
of
buccleuch
lord
montagu
and
other
noblemen
he
was
visited
by
dukes
and
princes
as
well
as
by
ladies
of
rank
and
fame
george
iv
sent
him
valuable
presents
and
showed
him
every
mark
of
high
consideration
cambridge
and
oxford
tendered
to
him
honorary
degrees
wherever
he
travelled
he
was
received
with
honor
and
distinction
and
flatteries
but
he
did
not
like
flatteries
and
this
was
one
reason
why
he
did
not
openly
acknowledge
his
authorship
of
his
novels
until
all
doubt
was
removed
by
the
masterly
papers
of
john
leycester
adolphus
in
scott
correspondence
must
have
been
enormous
for
his
postage
bills
amounted
to
per
annum
besides
the
aid
he
received
from
franks
which
with
his
natural
economy
he
made
no
scruple
in
liberally
using
perhaps
his
most
confidential
letters
were
like
byron
written
to
his
publishers
and
printers
though
many
such
were
addressed
to
his
lockhart
and
to
his
dearest
friend
william
erskine
but
he
had
also
some
admirable
women
friends
with
whom
he
corresponded
freely
some
of
the
choicest
of
his
letters
are
to
lady
abercorn
who
was
an
intimate
and
helpful
friend
to
miss
anna
seward
a
literary
confidant
of
many
years
to
lady
louisa
stuart
daughter
of
the
earl
of
bute
and
granddaughter
of
mary
wortley
montagu
one
of
the
few
who
knew
from
the
first
of
his
waverley
authorship
and
to
john
hughes
an
early
and
most
affectionate
friend
whose
grandson
thomas
hughes
has
made
famous
the
commonplace
name
of
tom
brown
in
our
own
day
scott
letters
show
the
man
frank
cordial
manly
tender
generous
finding
humor
in
difficulties
pleasure
in
toil
satisfaction
in
success
a
proud
courage
in
adversity
and
the
purest
happiness
in
the
affection
of
his
friends
how
scott
found
time
for
so
much
work
is
a
mystery
writing
nearly
three
novels
a
year
besides
other
literary
labors
attending
to
his
duties
in
the
courts
overlooking
the
building
of
abbotsford
and
the
cultivation
of
his
twelve
hundred
acres
and
entertaining
more
guests
than
voltaire
did
at
ferney
he
was
too
much
absorbed
by
his
legal
duties
and
his
literary
labors
to
be
much
of
a
traveller
yet
he
was
a
frequent
visitor
to
london
saw
something
of
paris
journeyed
through
ireland
was
familiar
with
the
lake
region
in
england
and
penetrated
to
every
interesting
place
in
scotland
he
did
not
like
london
and
took
little
pleasure
in
the
ovations
he
received
from
people
of
rank
and
fashion
as
a
literary
lion
at
the
tables
of
the
great
he
disappointed
many
of
his
admirers
since
he
made
no
effort
to
shine
it
was
only
in
his
modest
den
in
castle
street
or
in
rambles
in
the
country
or
at
abbotsford
that
he
felt
himself
at
home
and
appeared
to
the
most
advantage
it
would
be
pleasant
to
leave
this
genuinely
great
man
in
the
full
flush
of
health
creative
power
inward
delight
and
outward
prosperity
but
that
were
to
leave
unwritten
the
finest
and
noblest
part
of
his
life
it
is
to
the
misfortunes
which
came
upon
him
that
we
owe
both
a
large
part
of
his
splendid
achievements
in
literature
and
our
knowledge
of
the
most
admirable
characteristics
of
the
man
my
running
record
of
his
novels
last
mentioned
the
monastery
issued
in
in
the
same
year
with
perhaps
the
prime
favorite
of
all
his
works
ivanhoe
the
romantic
tale
of
england
in
the
crusading
age
of
richard
the
in
he
put
forth
the
fascinating
elizabethan
tale
of
kenilworth
in
came
the
pirate
the
tale
of
sea
and
shore
that
inspired
james
fenimore
cooper
to
write
the
pilot
and
his
other
and
the
fortunes
of
nigel
in
peveril
of
the
peak
and
quentin
durward
both
among
his
best
in
ronan
well
and
redgauntlet
and
in
two
more
tales
of
the
crusaders
the
betrothed
and
the
talisman
the
latter
probably
sharing
with
ivanhoe
the
greatest
popularity
in
the
winter
of
a
widespread
area
of
commercial
distress
resulted
in
the
downfall
of
many
firms
and
among
others
to
succumb
were
hurst
robinson
publishers
whose
failure
precipitated
that
of
constable
scott
publishers
and
of
the
ballantynes
his
printers
with
whom
he
was
a
secret
partner
who
were
largely
indebted
to
the
constables
and
so
to
the
creditors
of
that
house
the
crash
came
january
and
scott
found
himself
in
debt
to
the
amount
of
about
or
nearly
such
a
vast
misfortune
overwhelming
a
man
at
the
age
of
might
well
crush
out
all
life
and
hope
and
send
him
into
helpless
bankruptcy
with
the
poor
consolation
that
though
legally
responsible
he
was
not
morally
bound
to
pay
other
people
debts
but
scott
own
sanguine
carelessness
had
been
partly
to
blame
for
the
ballantyne
failure
and
he
faced
the
billow
as
it
suddenly
appeared
bowed
to
it
in
grief
but
not
in
shame
and
while
not
pretending
to
any
stoicism
instantly
resolved
to
devote
the
remainder
of
his
life
to
the
repayment
of
the
creditors
the
solid
substance
of
manliness
honor
and
cheerful
courage
in
his
character
the
genuine
piety
with
which
he
accepted
the
dispensation
and
wrote
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
the
unexampled
steadiness
with
which
he
comforted
his
wife
and
daughters
while
girding
himself
to
the
daily
work
of
intellectual
production
amidst
his
many
distresses
the
sweetness
of
heart
with
which
he
acknowledged
the
sympathy
and
declined
the
offers
of
help
that
poured
in
upon
him
from
every
side
one
poor
music
teacher
offering
his
little
savings
of
and
an
anonymous
admirer
urging
upon
him
a
loan
of
all
this
is
the
beauty
that
lighted
up
the
black
cloud
of
scott
adversity
his
efforts
were
finally
successful
although
at
the
cost
of
his
bodily
existence
lockhart
says
he
paid
the
penalty
of
health
and
life
but
he
saved
his
honor
and
his
glory
dies
not
and
the
grief
is
past

this
completes
the

of
scott
greater
productions
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
during
all
the
years
of
his
creative
work
he
was
incessantly
doing
critical
and
historical
writing
producing
numerous
reviews
essays
ballads

fifteen
celebrated
english

fielding
smollett
etc
letters
and
pamphlets
dramas
even
a
few
religious
discourses
and
his
very
extensive
and
interesting
private
correspondence
he
was
such
a
marvel
of
productive
as
has
seldom
if
ever
been
known
to
humanity
the
illness
and
death
of
scott
beloved
wife
but
four
short
months
after
his
commercial
disaster
was
a
profound
grief
to
him
and
under
the
exhausting
pressure
of
incessant
work
during
the
five
years
following
his
bodily
power
began
to
fail
so
that
in
october
after
a
paralytic
shock
he
stopped
all
literary
labor
and
went
to
italy
for
recuperation
the
following
june
he
returned
to
london
weaker
in
both
mind
and
body
was
taken
to
abbotsford
in
july
and
on
the
september
with
his
children
about
him
the
kindly
manly
brave
and
tender
spirit
passed
away
at
the
time
of
his
death
sir
walter
had
reduced
his
great
indebtedness
to
a
life
insurance
of
in
the
hands
of
his
trustees
and
advanced
by
robert
cadell
an
edinburgh
bookseller
on
the
copyrights
of
scott
works
cleared
away
the
last
remnant
of
the
debt
and
within
twenty
years
cadell
had
reimbursed
himself
and
made
a
handsome
profit
for
his
own
account
and
that
of
the
family
of
sir
walter
the
moneyed
details
of
scott
literary
life
have
been
made
a
part
of
this
brief
sketch
both
because
his
phenomenal
fecundity
and
popularity
offer
a
convenient
measure
of
his
power
and
because
the
fiscal
misfortune
of
his
later
life
revealed
a
simple
grandeur
of
character
even
more
admirable
than
his
mental
force
scott
ruined
exclaimed
the
earl
of
dudley
when
he
heard
of
the
trouble
the
author
of
waverley
ruined
good
god
let
every
man
to
whom
he
has
given
months
of
delight
give
him
a
sixpence
and
he
will
rise
morning
richer
than
rothschild
but
the
sturdy
scotchman
accepted
no
dole
he
set
himself
to
work
out
his
own
salvation
william
howitt
in
his
homes
and
haunts
of
eminent
british
poets
estimated
that
scott
works
had
produced
as
profits
to
the
author
or
his
trustees
at
least
nearly
this
in
over
fifty
years
ago
and
only
years
from
scott
first
original
publication
add
the
results
of
the
past
fifty
years
and
remembering
that
this
gives
but
the
profits
conceive
the
immense
sums
that
have
been
freely
paid
by
the
intelligent
british
public
for
their
enjoyment
of
this
great
author
writings
then
besides
all
this
recall
the
myriad
volumes
of
scott
sold
in
america
which
paid
no
profit
to
the
author
or
his
heirs
there
is
no
parallel
voltaire
renown
and
monetary
rewards
as
the
of
the
eighteenth
century
offer
the
only
case
in
modern
times
that
approaches
scott
success
yet
voltaire
vast
wealth
was
largely
the
result
of
successful
speculation
as
a
purely
popular
author
whose
wholesome
fancy
great
heart
and
tireless
industry
has
delighted
millions
of
his
scott
stands
alone
while
as
a
man
he
holds
the
affection
and
respect
of
the
world
even
though
it
be
that
the
fashion
of
his
workmanship
passeth
away
wonder
not
lament
not
with
mithridates
he
could
say
i
have
lived
what
great
man
can
say
more
lord
byron
poetic
genius
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
depict
lord
byron
and
even
presumptuous
to
attempt
it
this
is
not
only
because
he
is
a
familiar
subject
the
triumphs
and
sorrows
of
whose
career
have
been
often
portrayed
but
also
because
he
presents
so
many
contradictions
in
his
life
and
character
lofty
yet
degraded
earnest
yet
frivolous
an
impersonation
of
noble
deeds
and
sentiments
and
also
of
almost
every
frailty
which
christianity
and
humanity
alike
condemn
no
great
man
has
been
more
extravagantly
admired
and
none
more
bitterly
assailed
but
generally
he
is
regarded
as
a
fallen
star
a
man
with
splendid
gifts
which
he
wasted
for
whom
pity
is
the
predominant
sentiment
in
broad
and
generous
minds
with
all
his
faults
the
people
are
proud
of
him
as
one
of
the
greatest
lights
in
our
literature
and
in
view
of
the
brilliancy
of
his
literary
career
his
own
nation
in
particular
does
not
like
to
have
his
defects
and
vices
dwelt
upon
it
blushes
and
condones
it
would
fain
blot
out
his
life
and
much
of
his
poetry
if
without
them
it
could
preserve
the
best
and
grandest
of
his
writings
that
autobiography
which
goes
by
the
name
of
childe
pilgrimage
in
which
he
soars
to
loftier
flights
than
any
english
poet
from
milton
to
his
own
time
like
shakespeare
like
dryden
like
pope
like
burns
he
was
a
born
poet
while
most
of
the
other
poets
however
eminent
and
excellent
were
simply
made
made
by
study
and
labor
on
a
basis
of
talent
rather
than
exalted
by
native
genius
as
he
was
speaking
out
what
he
could
not
help
and
revelling
in
the
richness
of
unconscious
gifts
whether
for
good
or
evil
byron
was
a
man
with
qualities
so
generous
yet
so
wild
that
lamartine
was
in
doubt
whether
to
call
him
angel
or
devil
but
whether
angel
or
devil
his
life
is
the
saddest
and
most
interesting
among
all
the
men
of
letters
in
the
nineteenth
century
of
course
most
of
our
material
comes
from
his
life
and
letters
as
edited
by
his
friend
and
thomas
moore
this
biographer
i
think
has
been
unwisely
candid
in
the
delineation
of
byron
character
making
revelations
that
would
better
have
remained
in
doubt
and
on
which
friendship
at
least
should
have
prompted
him
to
a
discreet
silence
lord
byron
was
descended
from
the
byrons
of
normandy
who
accompanied
william
the
conqueror
in
his
invasion
of
england
of
which
illustrious
lineage
the
poet
was
prouder
than
of
his
poetry
in
the
reign
of
henry
on
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
a
byron
came
into
possession
of
the
old
mediaeval
abbey
of
newstead
in
the
reign
of
james
sir
john
byron
was
made
a
knight
of
the
order
of
the
bath
in
the
father
of
the
poet
a
dissipated
captain
of
the
guards
being
in
embarrassed
circumstances
married
a
rich
scotch
heiress
of
the
name
of
gordon
handsome
and
reckless
mad
jack
byron
speedily
spent
his
wife
fortune
and
when
he
died
his
widow
being
reduced
to
a
pittance
of
a
year
retired
to
scotland
to
live
with
her
infant
son
who
had
been
born
in
london
she
was
plain
byron
widow
of
a
younger
son
with
but
little
expectation
of
future
rank
she
was
a
woman
of
caprices
and
eccentricities
and
not
at
all
fitted
to
superintend
the
education
of
her
wayward
boy
hence
the
childhood
and
youth
of
byron
were
sad
and
unfortunate
his
temper
was
violent
and
passionate
a
malformation
of
his
foot
made
him
peculiarly
sensitive
and
the
unwise
treatment
of
his
mother
fond
and
harsh
by
turns
destroyed
maternal
authority
at
five
years
of
age
he
was
sent
to
a
in
aberdeen
where
he
made
but
slim
attainments
though
excitable
and
he
is
said
to
have
been
affectionate
and
generous
and
perfectly
fearless
a
fit
of
sickness
rendered
his
removal
from
this
school
necessary
and
he
was
sent
to
a
summer
resort
among
the
highlands
his
early
impressions
were
therefore
favorable
to
the
development
of
the
imagination
coming
as
they
did
from
mountains
and
valleys
rivulets
and
lakes
near
the
sources
of
the
dee
at
the
age
of
eight
he
wrote
verses
and
fell
in
love
like
dante
at
the
age
of
nine
on
the
death
of
the
grandson
of
the
old
lord
byron
in
this
unpromising
youth
became
the
to
the
barony
nor
did
he
have
to
wait
long
for
soon
after
his
died
and
the
young
byron
whose
mother
was
struggling
with
poverty
became
a
ward
of
chancery
and
the
earl
of
carlisle
one
of
the
richest
and
most
powerful
noblemen
of
the
realm
a
nephew
by
marriage
of
the
deceased
peer
was
appointed
his
guardian
this
cold
formal
and
politic
nobleman
took
but
little
interest
in
his
ward
leaving
him
to
the
mismanagement
of
his
mother
who
with
her
boy
at
the
age
of
ten
now
removed
to
newstead
the
seat
of
his
ancestors
the
government
meanwhile
for
some
reason
which
is
not
explained
having
conferred
on
her
a
pension
of
a
year
one
of
the
first
things
that
byron
did
on
her
removal
to
newstead
was
to
intrust
her
son
to
the
care
of
a
quack
in
nottingham
in
order
to
cure
him
of
his
lameness
as
the
doctor
was
not
successful
the
boy
was
removed
to
london
with
the
double
purpose
of
effecting
a
cure
under
an
eminent
surgeon
and
of
educating
him
according
to
his
rank
for
his
education
thus
far
had
been
sadly
neglected
although
it
would
appear
that
he
was
an
omnivorous
reader
in
a
desultory
kind
of
way
the
lameness
was
never
cured
and
through
life
was
a
subject
of
bitter
sensitiveness
on
his
part
glennie
of
dulwich
to
whose
instruction
he
was
now
confided
found
him
hard
to
manage
because
of
his
own
undisciplined
nature
and
the
perpetual
interference
of
his
mother
his
progress
was
so
slow
in
latin
and
greek
that
at
the
end
of
two
years
in
he
was
removed
to
harrow
one
of
the
great
public
schools
of
england
of
which
drury
was
for
a
year
or
two
owing
to
that
constitutional
shyness
which
is
so
often
mistaken
for
pride
young
byron
made
but
few
friendships
although
he
had
for
many
who
were
afterwards
distinguished
including
sir
robert
peel
before
he
left
this
school
for
cambridge
however
he
had
made
many
friends
whom
he
never
forgot
being
of
a
very
generous
and
loving
disposition
i
think
that
those
years
at
harrow
were
the
happiest
he
ever
knew
for
he
was
under
a
strict
discipline
and
was
too
young
to
indulge
in
those
dissipations
which
were
the
bane
of
his
subsequent
life
but
he
was
not
distinguished
as
a
scholar
in
the
ordinary
sense
although
in
his
days
he
wrote
some
poetry
remarkable
for
his
years
and
read
a
great
many
books
he
read
in
bed
read
when
no
one
else
read
read
while
eating
read
all
sorts
of
books
and
was
capable
of
great
sudden
exertions
but
not
of
continuous
drudgeries
which
he
always
abhorred
in
the
year
when
a
youth
of
fifteen
he
formed
a
strong
attachment
for
a
miss
chaworth
two
years
his
senior
who
looking
upon
him
as
a
mere
schoolboy
treated
him
cavalierly
and
made
some
slighting
allusion
to
that
lame
boy
this
treatment
both
saddened
and
embittered
him
when
he
left
school
for
college
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
an
idle
and
a
wilful
boy
with
a
very
imperfect
knowledge
of
latin
and
greek
young
byron
entered
trinity
college
in
poorly
prepared
and
was
never
distinguished
there
for
those
attainments
which
win
the
respect
of
tutors
and
professors
he
wasted
his
time
and
gave
himself
up
to
pleasures
riding
boating
bathing
and
social
hilarities
yet
reading
more
than
anybody
imagined
and
writing
poetry
for
which
he
had
an
extraordinary
facility
yet
not
contending
for
college
prizes
his
intimate
friends
were
few
but
to
his
chosen
circle
he
was
faithful
and
affectionate
no
one
at
this
time
would
have
predicted
his
future
eminence
a
more
unpromising
youth
did
not
exist
within
the
walls
of
his
college
he
had
a
most
unfortunate
temper
which
would
have
made
him
unhappy
under
any
circumstances
in
which
he
could
be
placed
this
temper
which
he
inherited
from
his
mother
passionate
fitful
defiant
restless
wayward
melancholy
inclined
him
naturally
to
solitude
and
often
isolated
him
even
from
his
friends
and
companions
he
brooded
upon
supposed
wrongs
and
created
in
his
soul
strong
likes
and
dislikes
what
is
worse
he
took
no
pains
to
control
this
temperament
and
at
last
it
mastered
him
drove
him
into
every
kind
of
folly
and
rashness
and
made
him
appear
worse
than
he
really
was
this
inborn
tendency
to
moodiness
pride
and
recklessness
should
be
considered
in
our
estimate
of
byron
and
should
modify
any
harshness
of
judgment
in
regard
to
his
character
which
in
some
other
respects
was
interesting
and
noble
he
was
not
at
all
envious
but
frank
and
true
to
those
he
loved
who
were
however
very
few
if
he
had
learned
and
had
not
been
spoiled
by
his
mother
his
career
might
have
been
far
different
from
what
it
was
and
would
have
sustained
the
admiration
which
his
brilliant
genius
called
out
from
both
high
and
low
as
it
was
byron
left
college
with
dangerous
habits
with
no
reputation
for
scholarship
with
but
few
friends
and
an
uncertain
future
his
bright
and
witty
bursts
of
poetry
wonderful
as
the
youthful
effusions
of
dryden
and
pope
had
made
him
known
to
a
small
circle
but
had
not
brought
fame
for
which
his
soul
passionately
thirsted
from
first
to
last
for
a
nobleman
he
was
poor
and
embarrassed
and
his
youthful
extravagances
had
tied
up
his
inherited
estate
he
was
cast
upon
the
world
like
a
ship
without
a
rudder
and
without
ballast
he
was
aspiring
indeed
but
without
a
plan
tired
out
and
disgusted
before
he
was
having
prematurely
exhausted
the
ordinary
pleasures
of
life
and
being
already
inclined
to
that
downward
path
which
leadeth
to
destruction
this
was
especially
marked
in
his
relations
with
women
whom
generally
he
flattered
despised
and
deserted
as
the
amusements
of
an
idle
hour
and
yet
whose
society
he
could
not
do
without
in
the
ardor
of
his
impulsive
and
ungoverned
affections
in
that
early
career
of
unbridled
desire
for
excitement
and
pleasure
nowhere
do
we
see
a
sense
of
duty
a
respect
for
the
opinions
of
the
good
a
reverence
for
religious
institutions
or
of
any
kind
but
these
defects
were
partly
covered
over
by
his
many
virtues
and
his
exalted
rank
thus
far
byron
was
comparatively
unknown
not
yet
was
he
even
a
favorite
in
society
beautiful
and
brilliant
as
he
was
for
he
had
few
friends
not
much
money
and
many
enemies
whom
he
made
by
his
scorn
and
defiance
a
born
aristocrat
without
having
penetrated
those
exclusive
circles
to
which
his
birth
entitled
him
he
was
always
quarrelling
with
his
mother
and
was
treated
with
indifference
by
his
guardian
he
was
shunned
by
those
who
adhered
to
the
conventionalities
of
life
and
was
pursued
by
bailiffs
and
creditors
since
his
ancestral
estates
small
for
his
rank
were
encumbered
and
mortgaged
and
newstead
abbey
itself
was
in
a
state
of
dilapidation
within
a
year
from
leaving
cambridge
in
byron
published
a
volume
of
his
juvenile
poems
and
although
they
were
remarkable
for
a
young
man
of
twenty
they
were
not
of
sufficient
merit
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
public
at
this
time
he
was
abstemious
in
eating
wishing
to
reduce
a
tendency
to
corpulence
he
could
practise
if
it
were
to
make
his
person
attractive
especially
to
ladies
nor
was
he
idle
his
reading
if
desultory
was
vast
and
from
the
list
of
books
which
his
biographer
has
noted
it
would
seem
that
macaulay
never
read
more
than
byron
in
a
given
time
all
the
noted
historians
of
england
germany
rome
and
greece
with
innumerable
biographies
miscellanies
and
even
divinity
the
raw
material
which
he
afterwards
worked
into
his
poems
how
he
found
time
to
devour
so
many
solid
books
is
to
me
a
mystery
these
were
not
merely
european
works
but
asiatic
also
he
was
not
a
critical
scholar
but
he
certainly
had
a
passing
familiarity
with
almost
everything
in
literature
worth
knowing
which
he
subsequently
utilized
as
seen
in
his
childe
harold
pilgrimage
a
college
reputation
was
nothing
to
him
any
more
than
it
was
to
swift
goldsmith
churchill
gibbon
and
many
other
famous
men
of
letters
who
left
on
record
their
dislike
of
the
english
system
of
education
among
these
were
even
such
men
as
addison
cowper
milton
and
dryden
who
were
scholars
but
who
alike
felt
that
college
honors
and
native
genius
did
not
go
hand
in
hand
which
might
almost
be
regarded
as
the
rule
but
for
a
few
remarkable
exceptions
like
sir
robert
peel
and
gladstone
and
yet
it
would
be
unwise
to
decry
college
honors
since
not
one
in
a
hundred
of
those
who
obtain
them
by
their
industry
aptness
and
force
of
will
can
lay
claim
to
what
is
called
genius
the
rarest
of
all
gifts
moreover
how
impossible
it
is
for
college
professors
to
detect
in
students
with
whom
they
are
imperfectly
acquainted
extraordinary
faculties
more
especially
if
the
young
men
are
apparently
idle
and
negligent
and
contemptuous
of
the
college
curriculum
it
was
a
bitter
pill
for
lord
byron
when
his
juvenile
poems
called
hours
of
idleness
were
so
severely
attacked
by
the
edinburgh
review
they
might
have
escaped
the
searching
eyes
of
the
critics
had
the
author
not
been
a
lord
at
that
time
the
great
reviews
had
just
been
started
and
it
was
the
especial
object
of
the
edinburgh
review
to
handle
authors
roughly
to
condemn
and
not
to
praise
criticism
was
not
then
a
science
as
it
became
fifty
years
later
in
the
hands
of
who
endeavored
to
review
every
production
fairly
and
justly
there
was
nothing
like
justice
entering
into
the
head
of
jeffrey
or
sydney
smith
or
brougham
or
later
on
of
macaulay
whose
articles
were
often
written
for
political
party
effect
critics
from
the
time
of
swift
down
to
the
middle
of
the
century
aimed
to
demolish
enemies
and
to
make
party
capital
hence
as
a
general
thing
their
articles
were
not
criticisms
at
all
but
attacks
and
as
even
an
achilles
was
vulnerable
in
his
heel
so
most
intellectual
giants
have
some
weak
point
for
the
shafts
of
malice
to
penetrate
yet
it
is
the
weaknesses
of
great
men
that
people
like
to
quote
if
byron
was
humiliated
enraged
and
embittered
by
the
severity
of
the
edinburgh
review
he
was
not
crushed
he
rallied
collected
his
unsuspected
strength
and
shattered
his
opponents
by
one
of
the
wittiest
most
brilliant
and
most
unscrupulous
satires
in
our
literature
which
he
called
english
bards
and
scotch
reviewers
at
the
height
of
his
fame
he
regretted
and
suppressed
this
youthful
production
of
malice
and
bitterness
yet
it
was
the
beginning
of
his
great
career
both
as
to
a
consciousness
of
his
own
powers
and
in
attracting
the
public
attention
it
was
doubtless
unwise
since
he
attacked
many
who
were
afterwards
his
friends
and
since
he
sowed
the
seeds
of
hatred
among
those
who
might
otherwise
have
been
his
admirers
or
apologists
he
had
to
learn
the
truth
that
with
what
measure
ye
mete
it
shall
be
measured
to
you
again
the
creators
of
public
opinion
in
reference
to
byron
have
not
been
women
of
fashion
or
men
of
the
world
but
literary
lions
themselves
like
thackeray
who
detested
him
and
the
whole
school
of
pharisaic
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
who
abhorred
in
him
sentiments
which
they
condoned
in
fielding
in
burns
in
rousseau
and
in
voltaire
before
his
bitter
satire
was
published
however
byron
took
his
seat
in
the
house
of
lords
not
knowing
any
peer
sufficiently
to
be
introduced
by
him
his
guardian
lord
carlisle
treated
him
very
shabbily
refusing
to
furnish
to
the
lord
chancellor
some
important
information
of
a
technical
kind
which
refusal
delayed
the
ceremony
for
several
weeks
until
the
necessary
papers
could
be
procured
from
cornwall
relating
to
the
marriage
of
one
of
his
ancestors
unfriended
and
alone
byron
sat
on
the
scarlet
benches
of
the
house
of
lords
until
he
was
formally
admitted
as
a
peer
but
when
the
lord
chancellor
left
the
woolsack
to
congratulate
him
and
with
a
smiling
face
extended
his
hand
the
embittered
young
peer
bowed
coldly
and
stiffly
and
simply
held
out
two
or
three
of
his
fingers
an
act
of
impudence
for
which
there
was
no
excuse
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
lord
byron
should
have
had
so
few
friends
or
even
acquaintances
at
that
time
among
people
of
his
rank
at
he
was
a
lonely
and
solitary
man
mortified
by
the
attack
of
the
edinburgh
review
exasperated
by
injustice
morose
even
to
misanthropy
and
decidedly
sceptical
in
his
religious
opinions
newstead
abbey
was
a
burden
to
him
since
he
could
not
keep
it
up
he
owed
he
had
no
domestic
ties
except
to
a
mother
with
whom
he
could
not
live
his
poetry
had
not
brought
him
fame
for
which
of
all
things
he
most
ardently
thirsted
his
love
affairs
were
unfortunate
and
tinged
his
soul
with
sadness
and
melancholy
nor
had
fashion
as
yet
marked
him
for
her
own
he
craved
excitement
and
society
to
him
was
dull
and
conventional
it
is
not
surprising
that
under
these
circumstances
byron
made
up
his
mind
to
travel
he
did
not
much
care
whither
provided
he
had
new
experiences
the
grand
tour
which
educated
young
men
of
leisure
and
fortune
took
in
that
day
had
no
charm
for
him
since
he
wished
to
avoid
rather
than
to
seek
society
in
those
cities
which
the
english
frequented
he
did
not
care
to
see
the
literary
lions
of
france
or
germany
or
italy
for
though
a
nobleman
he
was
too
young
and
unimportant
to
be
much
noticed
and
he
was
too
shy
and
too
proud
to
make
advances
which
might
be
rebuffed
wounding
his
he
set
out
on
his
pilgrimage
the
latter
part
of
june
in
a
ship
bound
for
lisbon
with
a
small
suite
of
servants
going
to
a
land
where
nature
was
most
enchanting
he
was
sufficiently
enthusiastic
over
the
hills
and
vales
and
villages
of
portugal
as
for
comfort
he
expected
little
and
found
less
but
to
this
he
was
indifferent
so
long
as
he
could
swim
in
the
tagus
and
ride
on
a
mule
and
procure
eggs
and
wine
he
was
delighted
with
cadiz
to
him
a
cythera
with
its
beautiful
but
uneducated
women
where
the
wives
of
peasants
were
on
a
par
with
the
wives
of
dukes
in
cultivation
and
where
the
minds
of
both
had
but
one
idea
that
of
intrigue
he
hastily
travelled
through
spain
on
horseback
in
august
reaching
gibraltar
from
which
he
embarked
for
malta
and
the
east
it
was
greece
and
turkey
that
byron
most
wished
to
see
and
know
and
favored
by
introductions
he
was
cordially
received
by
governors
and
pashas
at
athens
and
other
classical
spots
he
lingered
enchanted
yet
suppressing
his
enthusiasm
in
the
contempt
he
had
for
the
affected
raptures
of
ordinary
travellers
it
was
not
the
country
alone
with
its
classical
associations
which
interested
him
but
also
its
maidens
with
their
dark
hair
and
eyes
whom
he
idealized
almost
into
goddesses
everything
he
saw
was
picturesque
unique
and
fascinating
the
days
and
weeks
flew
rapidly
away
in
dreamy
enchantment
after
nearly
three
months
at
athens
byron
embarked
for
smyrna
and
explored
the
ruins
of
the
old
ionian
cities
thence
proceeding
to
constantinople
with
a
view
of
visiting
persia
and
the
farther
east
in
a
letter
to
henry
drury
he
says
i
have
left
my
home
and
seen
part
of
africa
and
asia
and
a
tolerable
portion
of
europe
i
have
been
with
generals
and
admirals
princes
and
pashas
governors
and
ungovernables
albania
indeed
i
have
seen
more
than
any
englishman
except
leake
a
country
rarely
visited
from
the
savage
character
of
the
natives
but
abounding
more
in
natural
beauties
than
the
classical
regions
of
greece
a
glimpse
of
byron
inner
life
at
this
time
is
caught
in
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
to
another
friend
i
have
now
been
nearly
a
year
abroad
and
hope
you
will
find
me
an
altered
personage
i
do
not
mean
in
body
but
in
manners
for
i
begin
to
find
out
that
nothing
but
virtue
will
do
in
this
d
d
world
i
am
tolerably
sick
of
vice
which
i
have
tried
in
its
agreeable
varieties
and
mean
on
my
return
to
cut
all
my
dissolute
acquaintance
leave
off
wine
and
carnal
company
and
betake
myself
to
politics
and
decorum
one
thing
we
notice
in
most
of
the
familiar
letters
of
byron
that
he
makes
frequent
use
of
a
vulgar
expletive
but
when
i
remember
that
the
prince
of
wales
the
lord
chancellor
the
judges
the
lawyers
the
ministers
of
the
crown
and
many
other
distinguished
people
were
accustomed
to
use
the
same
expression
i
would
fain
hope
that
it
was
not
meant
for
profanity
but
was
a
sort
of
fashionable
slang
intended
only
to
be
emphatic
fifty
years
have
seen
a
great
improvement
in
the
use
of
language
and
the
vulgarism
which
then
appeared
to
be
of
slight
importance
is
now
regarded
almost
universally
with
gentlemen
to
be
at
least
in
very
bad
taste
how
far
byron
transgressed
beyond
the
frequent
use
of
this
expletive
does
not
appear
either
in
his
letters
or
in
his
biography
yet
from
his
irreverent
nature
and
the
society
with
which
he
was
associated
it
is
more
than
probable
that
in
him
profanity
was
added
to
the
other
vices
of
his
times
especially
did
he
indulge
in
drinking
to
excess
in
all
convivial
gatherings
it
was
seldom
that
gentlemen
sat
down
to
a
banquet
without
each
despatching
two
or
three
bottles
of
wine
in
the
course
of
an
evening
no
wonder
that
gout
was
the
pervading
disease
among
county
squires
and
even
among
authors
and
statesman
morality
was
not
one
of
the
features
of
english
society
one
hundred
years
ago
except
as
it
consisted
in
a
scrupulous
regard
for
domesticity
truth
and
honor
and
abhorrence
of
meanness
and
hypocrisy
it
would
be
difficult
to
point
out
any
defects
and
excesses
of
which
byron
was
guilty
at
this
period
beyond
what
were
common
to
other
fashionable
young
men
of
rank
and
leisure
except
a
spirit
of
religious
scepticism
and
impiety
and
a
wanton
and
inexcusable
recklessness
in
regard
to
women
which
made
him
a
slave
to
his
passions
the
first
alienated
him
so
far
as
he
was
known
from
the
higher
respectable
classes
who
generally
were
punctilious
in
the
outward
observances
of
religion
and
the
second
made
him
abhorred
by
the
virtuous
middle
class
who
never
condoned
his
transgressions
in
this
respect
but
at
this
time
his
character
was
not
generally
known
it
was
not
until
he
was
seated
on
the
pinnacle
of
fame
that
public
curiosity
penetrated
the
scandals
of
his
private
life
he
was
known
only
as
a
young
nobleman
in
quest
of
the
excitements
of
foreign
travel
and
his
letters
of
introduction
procured
him
all
the
society
he
craved
not
yet
had
he
expressed
bitterness
and
wrath
against
the
country
which
gave
him
birth
he
simply
found
england
dull
and
craved
adventures
in
foreign
lands
as
unlike
england
as
he
could
find
the
east
stimulated
his
imagination
and
revived
his
classical
associations
he
saw
the
orient
only
as
an
enthusiastic
poet
would
see
it
and
as
lamartine
saw
jerusalem
but
byron
was
more
curious
about
the
pagan
cities
of
antiquity
than
concerning
the
places
consecrated
by
the
sufferings
of
our
lord
he
cared
more
to
swim
across
the
hellespont
with
leander
than
to
wander
over
the
sacred
hills
of
judaea
to
idealize
a
beautiful
peasant
girl
among
the
ruins
of
greece
than
converse
with
the
monks
of
palestine
in
their
gloomy
retreats
the
result
of
byron
travels
was
seen
in
the
first
two
cantos
of
childe
harold
showing
alike
the
fertility
of
his
mind
and
the
aspirations
of
a
lofty
genius
these
were
published
in
soon
after
his
return
to
england
at
the
age
of
they
took
england
by
storm
creating
both
surprise
and
admiration
public
curiosity
and
enthusiasm
for
the
young
poet
who
had
mounted
to
the
front
ranks
of
literature
at
a
single
leap
was
unbounded
and
universal
as
he
himself
wrote
i
awoke
one
morning
and
found
myself
famous
young
byron
was
now
sought
courted
and
adored
especially
by
ladies
of
the
highest
rank
everybody
was
desirous
to
catch
even
a
glimpse
of
the
greatest
poet
that
had
appeared
since
pope
and
dryden
any
palace
or
he
desired
to
enter
was
open
to
him
he
was
surfeited
with
roses
and
praises
and
incense
he
alone
took
precedence
over
scott
and
coleridge
and
moore
and
campbell
for
a
time
his
in
literature
was
generally
conceded
he
was
the
foremost
man
of
letters
of
his
day
and
the
greatest
popular
idol
his
rank
added
to
his
since
not
many
noblemen
were
distinguished
for
genius
or
literary
excellence
his
singular
beauty
of
face
and
person
despite
his
slight
lameness
attracted
the
admiring
gaze
of
women
what
abélard
was
in
the
schools
of
philosophy
byron
was
in
the
of
london
people
forgot
his
antecedents
so
far
as
they
were
known
in
the
intoxication
of
universal
admiration
and
unbounded
worship
of
genius
no
poet
in
english
history
was
ever
seated
on
a
prouder
throne
and
no
heathen
deity
was
ever
more
indifferent
than
he
to
the
incense
of
idolaters
far
be
it
from
me
to
attempt
an
analysis
of
the
merits
of
the
poem
with
which
the
fame
of
byron
will
be
forever
identified
its
great
merits
are
universally
conceded
and
while
it
has
defects
great
inequalities
in
both
style
and
matter
some
stanzas
supernal
in
beauty
and
others
only
mediocre
on
the
whole
the
poem
is
extraordinary
byron
adopted
the
spenserian
measure
perhaps
the
most
difficult
of
all
measures
hard
even
to
read
aloud
in
which
blank
verse
seems
to
blend
with
rhyme
it
might
be
either
to
the
ear
though
to
the
eye
it
is
elaborate
rhyme
such
as
would
severely
task
a
made
poet
but
which
this
born
poet
seems
to
have
thrown
off
without
labor
the
leading
peculiarity
of
the
poem
is
description
of
men
and
places
of
the
sea
the
mountain
and
the
river
of
nature
in
her
loveliness
and
mysteries
of
cities
and
consecrated
by
the
heroism
of
brave
and
gifted
men
in
greece
in
rome
in
mediaeval
europe
with
swift
passing
glances
at
salient
points
in
history
showing
extensive
reading
and
deep
meditation
as
to
the
spirit
of
childe
harold
it
is
not
satirical
it
is
more
pensive
than
bitter
and
reveals
the
loneliness
and
sorrows
of
an
unsatisfied
soul
the
unrest
of
a
pilgrim
in
search
for
something
new
it
seeks
to
penetrate
the
secrets
of
struggling
humanity
at
war
often
with
those
certitudes
which
are
the
consolation
of
our
inner
life
it
everywhere
recognizes
the
soul
as
that
which
gives
greatest
dignity
to
man
it
invokes
love
as
the
noblest
joy
of
life
the
poem
is
one
of
the
most
ideal
of
human
productions
soaring
beyond
what
is
material
and
transient
it
is
not
religious
not
reverential
not
christian
like
the
divine
comedy
and
the
paradise
lost
and
yet
it
is
lofty
aspiring
exulting
in
what
is
greatest
in
deed
or
song
destined
to
immortality
of
fame
and
admiration
it
is
a
confession
indirectly
of
the
follies
and
shortcomings
of
the
author
and
of
their
retribution
but
complains
not
of
the
nemesis
that
avenges
everything
it
is
sensitive
of
wrongs
and
injustices
and
misrepresentations
but
does
not
hurl
anathemas
speaking
in
sorrow
rather
than
in
anger
except
in
regard
to
hypocrisies
and
shams
and
lies
when
its
scorn
is
intense
and
terrible
the
whole
poem
is
brilliant
and
original
but
does
not
flash
like
fire
in
a
dark
night
it
was
written
with
the
heart
blood
and
is
as
earnest
as
it
is
penetrating
it
does
not
ascend
to
the
higher
mysteries
forever
veiled
from
mortal
eye
nor
descend
to
the
deepest
depths
of
hatred
and
despair
but
confines
itself
to
those
passions
which
have
marked
gifted
mortals
and
those
questionings
in
which
all
thoughtful
minds
have
ever
delighted
it
does
not
make
revelations
like
hamlet
or
macbeth
it
does
not
explore
secrets
hidden
forever
from
ordinary
minds
like
faust
but
it
muses
and
meditates
on
what
fate
and
time
have
brought
to
pass
such
events
as
have
been
revealed
in
history
it
invokes
the
neglected
but
impressive
monuments
of
antiquity
to
tell
the
tales
of
glory
and
of
shame
in
moral
wisdom
it
is
vastly
inferior
to
shakspeare
and
it
is
not
rich
in
those
wise
and
striking
lines
which
pass
into
the
proverbs
of
the
world
but
it
has
the
glow
of
a
poetic
soul
longing
for
fame
craving
love
and
not
unmindful
of
immortality
its
most
beautiful
stanzas
are
full
of
tenderness
and
sadness
for
lost
or
unrequited
affections
of
reproachless
sorrow
for
broken
friendships
in
which
the
soul
would
fain
have
lived
but
for
inconsistencies
and
contradictions
which
made
true
and
permanent
love
impossible
the
poem
paints
a
paradise
lost
rather
than
a
paradise
regained
i
wonder
at
its
popularity
for
it
seems
to
me
too
deep
and
learned
for
popular
appreciation
except
in
those
stanzas
where
pathos
or
enthusiasm
expressed
in
matchless
language
appeal
to
the
heart
and
soul
of
all
modern
poets
byron
is
the
most
human
and
outspoken
daring
to
say
what
many
would
fear
or
blush
to
meditate
upon
he
fearlessly
reveals
the
infirmities
and
audacities
of
a
double
and
mysterious
nature
made
up
of
dust
and
deity
now
grovelling
in
the
mire
then
borne
aloft
to
the
skies
the
football
of
the
eternal
powers
of
good
and
evil
enslaved
and
yet
to
be
emancipated
as
we
may
hope
in
the
last
and
final
struggle
when
the
soul
is
rescued
by
omnipotence
i
have
alluded
to
the
triumphs
of
byron
on
the
publication
of
childe
harold
but
his
joys
were
more
than
balanced
by
his
sorrows
his
mother
died
suddenly
without
seeing
him
his
dearest
friend
mathews
was
drowned
he
was
hampered
by
creditors
he
made
no
mark
in
the
house
of
lords
and
was
sick
of
what
he
called
parliamentary
mummeries
his
habits
became
more
and
more
dissipated
among
the
boon
companions
who
courted
his
society
his
reputation
after
a
while
began
to
wane
for
people
became
ashamed
of
their
enthusiasm
some
critics
disparaged
his
poetry
and
conventional
circles
were
shocked
by
his
morals
three
years
of
london
life
told
on
his
constitution
and
he
was
completely
disenchanted
he
sought
retirement
and
solitude
for
not
even
the
most
brilliant
society
satisfied
him
he
wearied
of
such
a
woman
and
admirer
as
madame
de
staël
he
went
to
holland
house
that
resort
of
all
the
eminent
ones
of
the
time
as
seldom
as
he
could
he
buried
himself
with
a
few
intimate
friends
chiefly
poets
among
whom
were
moore
and
rogers
he
saw
and
liked
sir
walter
scott
but
did
not
push
his
acquaintance
to
intimacy
the
larger
part
of
his
letters
were
written
to
murray
the
publisher
who
treated
him
generously
but
byron
gave
away
his
literary
gains
to
personal
friends
in
need
he
seemed
to
scorn
copyrights
for
support
he
would
write
only
for
fame
at
the
age
of
in
january
byron
married
miss
milbanke
a
lady
whom
he
did
not
love
but
to
whom
he
was
attracted
by
her
supposed
wealth
which
would
patch
up
his
own
fortunes
he
had
great
respect
for
this
lady
and
some
friendship
but
with
all
her
virtues
and
attainments
she
was
cold
conventional
and
exacting
a
mystery
shrouds
this
unfortunate
affair
which
has
never
been
fully
revealed
the
upshot
was
that
to
byron
inexpressible
humiliation
in
less
than
a
year
she
left
him
never
to
return
no
reasons
were
given
it
was
enough
that
both
parties
were
unhappy
and
had
cause
to
be
and
both
kept
silence
but
the
voice
of
rumor
and
scandal
was
not
silent
all
the
failings
of
byron
were
now
exaggerated
and
dwelt
upon
by
those
who
envied
him
and
by
those
who
hated
him
for
his
enemies
were
more
numerous
than
his
friends
those
whom
he
had
snubbed
or
ridiculed
or
insulted
now
openly
turned
against
him
the
conventional
public
had
a
rare
subject
for
their
abuse
or
indignation
proper
people
religious
people
and
commonplace
people
joined
in
the
cry
against
a
man
with
whom
a
virtuous
woman
could
not
live
indeed
no
woman
could
have
lived
happily
with
byron
and
very
few
were
the
women
with
whom
he
could
have
lived
happily
by
reason
of
that
irritability
and
unrest
which
is
so
common
with
genius
the
habits
of
abstraction
and
contemplation
which
absorbed
much
of
his
time
at
home
were
not
easily
understood
by
an
ordinary
woman
to
whom
social
life
is
necessary
byron
lived
much
in
his
library
which
was
his
solitary
luxury
in
the
revelry
of
the
imagination
his
heart
became
cold
to
follow
poetry
says
pope
one
must
leave
father
and
mother
and
cleave
to
it
alone
as
dante
and
petrarch
and
milton
did
not
even
byron
intense
craving
for
affection
could
be
satisfied
when
he
was
dwelling
on
the
ideals
which
his
imagination
created
and
which
scarcely
friendship
could
satisfy
even
so
good
a
man
as
carlyle
lived
among
his
books
rather
than
in
the
society
of
his
wife
whom
he
really
loved
and
whose
virtues
and
attainments
he
appreciated
and
admired
an
affectionate
woman
runs
a
great
risk
in
marrying
an
absorbed
and
preoccupied
man
of
genius
even
if
his
character
be
reproachless
unfortunately
the
character
of
byron
was
anything
but
reproachless
and
no
one
knew
this
better
than
his
wife
which
knowledge
doubtless
alienated
what
little
affection
she
had
for
him
he
seems
to
have
sought
low
company
even
after
his
marriage
and
lady
byron
has
intimated
that
she
did
not
think
him
altogether
sane
living
with
him
as
his
wife
was
insupportable
but
though
she
separated
from
him
she
did
not
seek
a
divorce
byron
would
not
have
married
at
all
if
he
had
consulted
his
happiness
and
still
more
his
fame
in
reviewing
the
great
names
of
philosophy
and
science
we
shall
find
that
those
who
have
most
distinguished
themselves
have
virtually
admitted
their
own
unfitness
for
the
marriage
tie
by
remaining
in
celibacy
newton
gassendi
galileo
descartes
bayle
locke
leibnitz
boyle
hume
gibbon
macaulay
and
a
host
of
others
the
scandal
which
byron
separation
from
his
wife
created
and
his
known
and
open
profligacy
at
last
shut
him
out
from
the
society
of
which
he
had
been
so
bright
an
ornament
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
the
english
people
which
redounds
to
their
honor
to
exclude
from
public
approbation
any
man
however
gifted
or
famous
who
has
outraged
the
moral
sense
by
open
and
violation
of
the
laws
of
morality
the
cases
of
dilke
and
parnell
in
our
own
day
are
illustrations
known
to
all
what
in
france
or
italy
is
condoned
is
never
pardoned
or
forgotten
in
england
not
even
a
voltaire
a
rousseau
or
a
mirabeau
had
they
lived
in
england
could
have
been
accepted
by
english
society
much
less
a
man
who
scorned
and
ridiculed
it
even
byron
for
a
few
years
the
pet
the
idol
and
the
glory
of
the
country
was
not
too
high
to
fall
to
quote
one
of
his
own
stanzas
he
who
ascends
to
shall
find
the
loftiest
peaks
most
wrapt
in
clouds
and
snow
he
who
surpasses
or
subdues
mankind
must
look
down
on
the
hate
of
those
below
though
high
above
the
sun
of
glory
glow
and
far
beneath
the
earth
and
ocean
spread
round
him
are
icy
rocks
and
loudly
blow
contending
tempests
on
his
naked
head
embarrassed
in
his
circumstances
filled
with
disgust
mortification
and
shame
excluded
from
the
proudest
circles
byron
now
resolved
to
leave
england
forever
and
bury
himself
in
such
foreign
lands
as
were
most
congenial
to
his
tastes
and
habits
but
for
his
immorality
he
might
still
have
shined
at
an
exalted
height
for
he
had
not
yet
written
anything
which
shocked
the
practical
english
mind
the
worst
he
had
written
was
bitter
satire
yet
not
more
bitter
than
that
of
swift
or
pope
no
defiance
no
blasphemous
sentiments
or
what
seemed
to
many
to
be
such
had
yet
escaped
him
his
corsair
and
his
bride
of
abydos
appeared
soon
after
the
childe
harold
and
added
to
his
fame
by
their
exquisite
melody
of
rhyme
and
sentimental
admiration
for
oriental
life
though
even
these
were
tinged
with
that
which
afterwards
made
his
latter
poems
a
scandal
and
reproach
the
disappointment
of
youthful
passion
the
lassitude
and
remorse
of
premature
excess
the
lone
friendlessness
of
his
life
and
i
may
add
the
reproaches
of
society
induced
him
to
fly
from
the
scene
of
his
brilliant
successes
filled
with
blended
sentiments
of
scorn
hatred
defiance
and
despair
in
the
spring
of
at
the
age
of
byron
left
england
forever
a
voluntary
exile
on
the
face
of
the
earth
saddened
embittered
and
disappointed
it
was
to
italy
that
he
turned
his
steps
passing
through
brussels
and
flanders
lingering
on
the
rhine
enamored
with
its
ruined
castles
still
more
with
nature
and
making
a
long
stay
in
switzerland
here
he
visited
the
castle
of
chillon
all
the
spots
made
memorable
by
the
abodes
of
rousseau
gibbon
and
madame
de
staël
and
all
the
most
interesting
scenery
of
the
bernese
alps
lake
leman
interlaken
thun
the
jungfrau
the
glaciers
brientz
chamouni
berne
and
on
to
geneva
where
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
shelley
and
his
wife
the
shelleys
he
found
most
congenial
and
stayed
with
them
some
time
while
in
the
neighborhood
of
geneva
he
produced
the
third
canto
of
childe
harold
the
prisoner
of
chillon
a
dream
and
other
things
in
october
he
passed
on
to
milan
verona
and
venice
and
in
this
latter
city
he
took
up
his
residence
oh
that
we
could
blot
out
byron
life
in
venice
made
up
of
love
adventures
and
dissipation
and
utter
abandonment
to
those
pleasures
that
appealed
to
his
lower
nature
as
if
he
were
possessed
by
a
demon
utterly
reckless
of
his
health
his
character
and
his
fame
venice
was
then
the
most
immoral
city
in
italy
given
over
to
idleness
and
pleasure
it
was
here
that
byron
contempt
for
woman
became
fixed
seeing
only
her
weaknesses
and
follies
and
it
was
this
contempt
of
woman
which
intensified
the
abhorrence
in
which
his
character
was
generally
held
in
the
most
respectable
circles
in
england
even
in
distant
venice
his
baleful
light
was
not
under
a
bushel
and
the
scandals
of
his
life
extended
far
and
wide
especially
that
in
reference
to
margherita
cogni
an
illiterate
virago
who
could
neither
read
nor
write
and
whom
he
was
finally
compelled
to
discard
on
account
of
the
violence
of
her
temper
after
living
with
her
in
the
most
open
manner
and
yet
in
all
this
degradation
he
was
not
idle
how
could
so
prolific
a
writer
be
idle
byron
did
not
ordinarily
rise
till
two
in
the
afternoon
and
spent
the
interval
between
his
breakfast
and
dinner
in
riding
on
the
lido
one
of
those
long
narrow
islands
which
lie
between
the
adriatic
and
the
lagoon
in
the
midst
of
which
venice
is
built
on
the
islets
arising
from
its
shallow
waters
yet
he
found
time
to
begin
his
don
juan
besides
writing
the
lament
of
tasso
the
tragedy
of
manfred
and
an
armenian
grammar
all
which
appeared
in
in
beppo
and
in
mazeppa
he
also
made
a
flying
trip
to
florence
and
rome
and
some
of
the
finest
stanzas
of
childe
harold
are
descriptions
of
the
classic
ruins
and
the
masterpieces
of
grecian
and
mediaeval
art
the
beauties
and
the
associations
of
great
cities
i
stood
in
venice
on
the
bridge
of
sighs
a
palace
and
a
prison
on
each
hand
i
saw
from
out
the
wave
her
structures
rise
as
from
the
stroke
of
the
enchanter
wand
a
thousand
years
their
cloudy
wings
expand
around
me
and
a
dying
glory
smiles
the
far
times
when
many
a
subject
land
looked
to
the
wingèd
lion
marble
piles
where
venice
sate
in
state
throned
on
her
hundred
isles
byron
correspondence
was
small
being
chiefly
confined
to
his
publisher
to
moore
and
to
a
few
intimate
friends
these
letters
are
interesting
because
of
their
frankness
and
wit
although
they
are
not
models
of
fine
writing
indeed
i
do
not
know
where
to
find
any
specimens
of
masterly
prose
in
all
his
compositions
he
was
simply
a
poet
facile
in
every
form
of
measure
from
spenser
to
campbell
no
remarkable
prose
writings
appeared
in
england
at
all
at
that
time
until
sir
walter
scott
novels
were
written
and
until
macaulay
carlyle
and
lamb
wrote
their
inimitable
essays
nothing
is
more
heavy
and
unartistic
than
moore
life
of
byron
there
is
hardly
a
brilliant
paragraph
in
it
and
yet
moore
is
one
of
the
most
musical
and
melodious
of
all
the
english
poets
milton
indeed
was
equally
great
in
prose
and
verse
but
very
few
men
have
been
distinguished
as
prose
writers
and
poets
at
the
same
time
sir
walter
scott
and
southey
are
the
most
remarkable
exceptions
i
think
that
macaulay
could
have
been
distinguished
as
a
poet
if
he
had
so
pleased
but
he
would
have
been
a
literary
poet
like
wordsworth
or
tennyson
or
coleridge
not
a
man
who
sings
out
of
his
soul
because
he
can
not
help
it
like
byron
or
burns
or
like
whittier
among
our
american
poets
it
was
not
until
when
byron
had
been
three
years
in
venice
that
he
fell
in
love
with
the
countess
guiccioli
the
wife
of
one
of
the
richest
nobles
of
italy
young
beautiful
and
interesting
this
love
seems
to
have
been
disinterested
and
lasting
and
while
it
was
a
violation
of
all
the
rules
of
morality
and
would
not
have
been
allowed
in
any
other
country
than
italy
it
did
not
further
degrade
him
it
was
pretty
much
such
a
love
as
voltaire
had
for
madame
de
châtelet
and
with
it
he
was
at
last
content
there
is
no
evidence
that
byron
ever
afterward
loved
any
other
woman
and
what
is
very
singular
about
the
affair
is
that
it
was
condoned
by
the
husband
until
it
became
a
scandal
even
in
italy
the
countess
was
taken
ill
on
her
way
to
ravenna
and
thither
byron
followed
her
and
lived
in
the
same
palace
with
her
the
palace
of
her
husband
who
courted
the
poet
society
and
who
afterward
left
his
young
countess
to
free
intercourse
with
byron
at
bologna
not
without
a
compensation
in
revenue
which
was
more
disgraceful
than
the
amour
itself
about
this
time
byron
would
probably
have
returned
to
england
but
for
the
enchantment
which
enslaved
him
he
could
not
part
from
the
countess
nor
she
from
him
the
pope
pronounced
the
separation
of
the
count
from
his
wife
and
she
returned
to
her
father
house
on
a
pittance
of
a
year
she
sacrificed
everything
for
the
young
english
poet
her
splendid
home
her
relatives
her
honor
and
her
pride
never
was
there
a
sadder
episode
in
the
life
of
a
man
of
letters
if
byron
had
married
such
a
woman
in
his
early
life
how
different
might
have
been
his
history
with
such
a
love
as
she
inspired
had
he
been
faithful
to
it
he
might
have
lived
in
radiant
happiness
the
idol
and
the
pride
of
all
admirers
of
genius
wherever
the
english
language
is
spoken
seated
on
a
throne
which
kings
might
envy
so
much
have
circumstances
to
do
with
human
destinies
since
abélard
never
was
there
a
man
more
capable
of
a
genuine
fervid
love
than
byron
and
yet
he
threw
himself
away
he
was
his
own
worst
enemy
and
all
from
an
nature
which
he
inherited
both
from
his
father
and
his
mother
with
no
mentor
to
whom
he
would
listen
and
thus
his
star
sunk
down
in
the
eternal
shades
a
fallen
lucifer
expelled
from
bliss
i
would
not
condone
the
waywardness
and
vices
of
byron
or
weaken
the
eternal
distinctions
between
right
and
wrong
the
impression
i
wish
to
convey
is
that
there
were
two
very
distinctly
marked
sides
to
his
character
that
his
conduct
was
not
without
palliations
in
view
of
his
surroundings
the
force
of
his
temptations
and
his
wayward
nature
uncurbed
by
parental
care
or
early
training
indeed
rather
goaded
on
by
the
unfortunate
conditions
of
his
youth
to
find
consolation
in
doing
as
he
liked
without
regard
to
duty
or
the
opinions
of
society
born
with
the
keenest
sensibilities
with
emotive
powers
of
tremendous
sweep
and
force
neglected
crossed
mortified
with
no
wise
guidance
he
was
driven
in
upon
himself
and
developed
an
intense
which
would
endure
no
control
unhappy
will
be
the
future
of
that
man
however
amiable
affectionate
and
generous
who
whether
from
neglect
in
youth
like
byron
or
from
sheer
wilfulness
in
manhood
determines
to
act
as
the
mood
takes
him
because
he
has
freedom
of
will
without
regard
to
the
social
restraints
imposed
upon
conscience
by
the
unwritten
law
which
pursues
him
wherever
he
goes
even
should
he
fly
to
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
no
one
can
escape
from
moral
accountability
whether
in
a
seductive
paradise
or
in
a
dungeon
or
in
a
desert
the
only
stability
for
society
must
be
in
the
character
of
its
individual
members
before
pleasure
comes
duty
to
family
to
friends
to
country
to
self
and
to
the
maker
this
sense
of
moral
accountability
byron
seems
never
to
have
had
in
regard
to
anybody
or
anything
his
culminating
in
an
egotism
melancholy
to
behold
he
would
go
where
he
pleased
say
what
he
pleased
write
as
he
pleased
do
what
he
pleased
without
any
constraint
whether
in
opposition
or
not
to
the
customs
and
rules
of
society
his
own
welfare
or
the
laws
of
god
it
was
moral
madness
pursuing
him
to
destruction
the
logical
and
necessary
sequence
of
unrestrained
sometimes
assuming
the
form
of
angelic
loveliness
and
inspiration
in
the
eyes
of
his
idolaters
no
counsellor
guided
him
wiser
than
moore
or
shelley
even
the
worldly
advice
of
rogers
and
madame
de
staël
was
thrown
away
whenever
they
presumed
to
counsel
him
nobody
could
influence
him
his
abandonment
to
fitful
labors
or
pleasures
was
alike
his
glory
and
his
shame
after
a
day
of
frivolity
he
would
consume
the
midnight
hours
in
the
intensest
studies
stimulated
by
gin
to
awake
in
the
morning
in
lassitude
or
pain
for
work
he
must
as
well
as
play
the
consequence
of
this
burning
the
candle
at
both
ends
was
failing
health
and
diminished
energies
until
his
short
race
was
run
he
had
produced
more
poetry
at
years
of
age
than
any
other
english
poet
at
the
age
of
fifty
some
of
almost
transcendent
merit
but
more
of
questionable
worth
though
not
of
questionable
power
aside
from
the
childe
harold
the
hebrew
melodies
the
prisoner
of
chillon
and
perhaps
the
corsair
the
bride
of
abydos
lara
and
the
siege
of
corinth
the
rest
excepting
minor
poems
however
beautiful
in
measure
and
grand
in
thought
give
a
shock
to
the
religious
or
to
the
moral
sentiments
cain
and
manfred
are
regarded
as
almost
blasphemous
though
probably
not
so
meant
to
be
by
the
poet
in
view
of
the
stirring
questions
of
grecian
tragedy
while
the
longest
of
his
poems
don
juan
is
an
insult
to
womanhood
and
a
disgrace
to
genius
for
although
containing
some
of
the
most
exquisite
touches
of
description
and
finest
flights
of
poetic
feeling
its
theme
is
along
the
lowest
level
of
human
passion
whatever
byron
wrote
was
unhesitatingly
published
and
read
whether
good
or
evil
whatever
were
those
follies
and
defiances
which
excluded
him
from
the
best
society
and
it
is
a
matter
of
surprise
to
me
that
any
noted
and
wealthy
publisher
could
be
found
in
respectable
and
conventional
england
venal
enough
to
publish
perhaps
the
most
corrupting
poem
in
our
language
worse
than
anything
which
boccaccio
wrote
for
his
italian
readers
or
anything
which
fielding
and
the
dramatists
of
the
reign
of
charles
ii
ever
allowed
to
go
into
print
for
though
they
were
coarser
in
their
language
they
were
not
so
seductive
in
their
spirit
and
did
not
poison
the
soul
like
don
juan
the
very
name
of
which
has
become
a
synonym
for
extreme
depravity
that
abominable
poem
was
read
because
lord
byron
wrote
it
and
because
its
immorality
was
slightly
veiled
by
the
beauty
of
the
language
even
when
a
copy
could
not
be
found
on
the
table
of
any
respectable
and
the
name
of
the
author
was
seldom
mentioned
except
with
stern
and
honest
censure
it
is
perhaps
fair
to
quote
murray
own
words
throwing
the
responsibility
on
the
public
they
talked
of
his
immoral
writings
but
there
is
a
whole
row
of
sermons
glued
to
my
shelf
i
hate
the
sight
of
them
why
do
they
buy
those
a
fair
enough
retort
and
yet
like
the
newspaper
purveyors
of
the
records
of
vice
in
our
own
day
the
publisher
was
responsible
for
making
the
vile
stuff
accessible
and
thus
debasing
the
public
taste
how
different
was
byron
painting
of
spanish
life
from
that
of
the
immortal
cervantes
whom
lowell
places
among
the
five
master
geniuses
of
the
world
in
don
quixote
there
is
not
a
sentence
which
does
not
exalt
woman
or
which
degrades
man
a
lofty
ideal
of
purity
and
chivalrous
honor
permeates
every
page
even
in
the
most
ludicrous
scenes
the
whole
work
blazes
with
wit
and
with
the
wisdom
of
a
proverbial
philosophy
uttered
by
the
ignorant
squire
of
a
fanatical
and
bewildered
knight
but
amidst
the
practical
jokes
and
follies
of
all
the
characters
in
that
marvellous
work
of
fiction
we
see
also
a
moral
beauty
idealized
of
course
such
as
was
rivalled
only
in
spanish
art
in
the
madonnas
of
murillo
i
believe
that
in
the
imaginary
sketches
of
spanish
life
as
portrayed
by
byron
slanders
and
lies
deface
the
poem
from
beginning
to
end
who
is
the
best
authority
for
truthfulness
in
the
description
of
spanish
people
cervantes
or
byron
the
spiritual
loftiness
portrayed
in
the
lives
of
spanish
heroes
and
heroines
mixed
up
as
it
was
with
the
most
ludicrous
pictures
of
common
life
has
made
the
spaniard
work
of
fiction
one
of
the
most
treasured
and
enduring
monuments
of
human
fame
whereas
the
insulting
innuendoes
of
the
english
poet
have
gone
far
to
rob
him
of
the
glory
which
he
had
justly
won
in
his
earlier
productions
and
to
make
his
name
a
doubt
if
in
the
course
of
generations
yet
to
come
the
evil
which
byron
did
by
that
one
poem
alone
shall
be
forgotten
in
the
services
he
rendered
to
our
literature
by
other
works
which
can
not
die
then
he
may
some
day
be
received
into
the
pantheon
of
the
benefactors
of
mind
i
would
speak
with
less
vehemence
in
reference
to
those
poems
which
are
generally
supposed
to
be
permeated
with
defiance
scorn
and
misanthropy
in
manfred
and
cain
it
was
with
byron
a
work
of
art
to
describe
the
utterances
of
impious
spirits
against
the
sovereign
rule
of
god
had
he
not
fallen
from
high
estate
as
an
interpreter
of
the
soul
the
critics
might
have
seen
here
nothing
more
to
condemn
than
in
some
of
the
grecian
tragedies
many
passages
in
the
paradise
lost
and
in
the
general
spirit
of
faust
it
is
no
proof
that
he
was
a
blasphemer
in
his
heart
because
he
painted
blasphemy
to
describe
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
driven
hither
and
thither
by
pursuing
vengeance
as
the
first
recorded
murderer
the
poet
was
obliged
by
all
the
rules
of
art
to
put
such
sentiments
into
his
mouth
as
accorded
with
his
unrepented
crime
and
his
dreadful
agonies
of
mind
and
soul
where
is
the
proof
that
they
were
agonies
remorse
despair
surely
we
may
pardon
in
byron
what
we
excuse
in
goethe
in
the
delineation
of
unique
characters
the
great
creations
which
belong
to
the
realm
of
the
imagination
alone
the
imputation
that
the
sayings
of
his
fallen
fiends
were
the
cherished
sentiments
of
the
poet
himself
may
have
been
one
cause
of
his
contempt
for
the
average
intelligence
of
his
countrymen
and
for
their
inveterate
and
incurable
prejudices
nothing
in
dante
is
more
intense
and
concentrated
in
language
than
the
malediction
of
eve
upon
her
fratricidal
son
may
the
grass
wither
from
thy
feet
the
woods
deny
thee
shelter
earth
a
home
the
dust
a
gravel
the
sun
his
light
and
heaven
her
god
yet
the
reader
feels
the
naturalness
of
this
bitter
cursing
of
her
own
son
by
the
frenzied
mother
how
could
a
great
artist
like
byron
put
sentiments
into
the
mouth
of
cain
such
as
would
be
harmless
in
the
essays
of
a
country
parson
if
he
painted
lucifer
he
must
make
him
speak
like
lucifer
not
like
a
theological
professor
nothing
could
be
more
ungenerous
and
narrow
than
to
abuse
byron
for
a
dramatic
poem
in
which
some
of
his
characters
were
fiends
rather
than
men
we
have
no
more
right
to
say
that
he
was
an
infidel
because
cain
or
lucifer
blasphemed
than
to
say
that
goethe
was
an
atheist
because
mephistopheles
denied
god
if
byron
had
avowed
atheistical
opinions
in
letters
or
conversations
that
would
be
another
thing
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
did
and
much
to
the
contrary
a
few
months
before
he
died
he
was
visited
by
a
pious
crank
who
out
of
curiosity
or
christian
zeal
sought
to
know
his
theological
views
byron
treated
him
with
the
greatest
courtesy
and
freely
communicated
his
opinions
on
religious
subjects
from
which
it
would
appear
that
he
differed
from
church
people
generally
only
on
the
matter
of
eternal
punishment
which
he
did
not
believe
was
consistent
with
infinite
love
or
infinite
justice
perhaps
it
would
have
been
wiser
if
he
had
not
written
cain
at
all
considering
how
many
readers
there
are
without
brains
and
how
large
was
the
class
predisposed
to
judge
him
harshly
in
everything
no
doubt
he
was
irreligious
and
sceptical
but
it
does
not
follow
from
this
that
he
was
atheistical
or
blasphemous
there
is
doubtless
a
misanthropic
vein
in
all
byron
later
poetry
which
is
not
wholesome
for
many
people
to
read
especially
in
manfred
one
of
the
bitterest
of
his
productions
by
reason
of
sorrows
and
disappointments
and
misrepresentations
it
was
byron
misfortune
to
appear
worse
than
he
really
was
owing
to
his
unconcealed
contempt
for
the
opinions
of
mankind
yet
he
could
not
complain
that
he
reaped
what
he
had
not
sown
some
of
his
biographers
thought
him
to
be
at
this
time
even
morbidly
desirous
of
a
bad
reputation
going
so
far
as
to
write
paragraphs
against
himself
in
foreign
journals
and
being
filled
with
glee
at
the
joke
when
they
were
republished
in
english
newspapers
he
despised
and
defied
all
conventionalities
and
conventional
england
dropped
him
from
her
list
of
favorites
the
life
of
byron
strange
to
say
was
less
exposed
to
scandal
after
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
countess
who
enslaved
him
and
who
was
also
enslaved
in
turn
his
heart
now
opened
to
many
noble
sentiments
he
returned
in
a
degree
to
society
and
gave
dinners
and
suppers
he
associated
with
many
distinguished
patriots
and
men
of
genius
he
had
a
strong
sympathy
with
the
italians
in
their
struggle
for
freedom
one
quarter
of
his
income
he
devoted
to
charities
he
was
regular
in
his
athletic
exercises
and
could
swim
four
hours
at
a
time
he
was
always
proud
of
swimming
across
the
hellespont
he
was
devoted
to
his
natural
daughter
and
educated
her
in
a
catholic
school
he
studied
more
severely
all
works
of
art
though
his
admiration
for
art
was
never
so
great
as
it
was
for
nature
the
glories
and
wonders
of
nature
inspired
him
with
perpetual
joys
there
is
nothing
finer
in
all
his
poetry
than
the
following
stanza
ye
stars
which
are
the
poetry
of
heaven
if
in
your
bright
leaves
we
would
read
the
fate
of
men
and
empires
is
to
be
forgiven
that
in
our
aspirations
to
be
great
our
destinies
their
mortal
state
and
claim
a
kindred
with
you
for
ye
are
a
beauty
and
a
mystery
and
create
in
us
such
love
and
reverence
from
afar
that
fortune
fame
power
life
have
named
themselves
a
star
there
never
was
a
time
when
byron
did
not
seek
out
beautiful
retreats
in
nature
as
the
source
of
his
highest
happiness
hence
solitude
was
nothing
to
him
when
he
could
commune
with
the
works
of
god
his
biographer
declares
that
in
he
was
greatly
improved
in
every
respect
in
genius
in
temper
in
moral
views
in
health
and
happiness
he
has
had
mischievous
passions
but
these
he
seems
to
have
subdued
he
was
always
temperate
in
his
diet
living
chiefly
on
fish
and
vegetables
and
if
he
drank
more
wine
and
spirits
than
was
good
for
him
it
was
to
rally
his
exhausted
energies
his
powers
of
production
were
never
greater
than
at
this
period
but
his
literary
labors
were
slowly
wearing
him
out
he
could
not
live
without
work
while
pleasure
palled
upon
him
in
a
letter
to
a
stranger
who
sought
to
convert
him
he
showed
anything
but
anger
or
contempt
do
me
says
he
the
justice
to
suppose
that
meliora
however
the
may
have
been
applied
to
my
conduct
writing
to
murray
in
he
says
it
is
not
impossible
that
i
may
have
three
or
four
cantos
of
juan
ready
by
autumn
as
i
obtained
a
permission
from
my
dictatress
the
countess
guiccioli
to
continue
it
provided
always
it
was
to
be
more
guarded
and
decorous
in
the
continuation
than
in
the
commencement
alas
he
could
not
undo
the
mischief
he
had
done
about
this
time
byron
received
a
visit
from
lord
clare
his
earliest
friend
at
cambridge
to
whom
through
life
he
was
devotedly
attached
a
friendship
which
afforded
exceeding
delight
he
never
forgot
his
few
friends
although
he
railed
at
his
enemies
he
was
ungenerously
treated
by
leigh
hunt
to
whom
he
rendered
every
kindness
he
says
i
have
done
all
i
could
for
him
since
he
came
here
genoa
but
it
is
all
most
useless
his
wife
is
ill
his
six
children
far
from
tractable
and
in
worldly
affairs
he
himself
is
a
child
the
death
of
shelley
left
them
totally
aground
and
i
could
not
see
them
in
such
a
state
without
using
the
common
feelings
of
humanity
and
what
means
were
in
my
power
to
set
them
afloat
again
as
to
any
community
of
feeling
thought
or
opinion
between
him
and
me
there
is
little
or
none
but
i
think
him
a
man
and
must
do
as
i
would
be
done
by
toward
shelley
byron
entertained
the
greatest
respect
and
affection
for
his
suavity
gentleness
and
good
breeding
and
shelley
accidental
death
was
a
great
shock
to
him
among
his
other
intimate
acquaintances
in
italy
were
lord
and
lady
blessington
with
whom
he
kept
up
a
pleasant
correspondence
the
most
plaintive
sad
and
generous
of
all
his
letters
was
the
one
he
wrote
to
lady
byron
from
pisa
in
in
acknowledgment
of
the
receipt
of
a
tress
of
his
daughter
ada
hair
the
time
which
has
elapsed
since
our
separation
has
been
considerably
more
than
the
whole
brief
period
of
our
union
and
of
our
prior
acquaintance
we
both
made
a
bitter
mistake
but
now
it
is
over
and
irrecoverably
so
but
this
very
impossibility
of
reunion
seems
to
me
at
least
a
reason
why
on
all
the
few
points
of
discussion
which
can
arise
between
us
we
should
preserve
the
courtesies
of
life
and
as
much
of
its
kindness
as
people
who
are
never
to
meet
may
preserve
more
easily
than
nearer
connections
i
assure
you
i
bear
you
now
no
resentment
whatever
whether
the
offence
has
been
solely
on
my
side
or
reciprocal
or
on
yours
chiefly
i
have
ceased
to
reflect
upon
any
but
two
things
that
you
are
the
mother
of
my
child
and
that
we
shall
never
meet
again
at
this
period
about
a
year
before
byron
death
moore
thus
writes
to
the
world
and
more
especially
england
he
presented
himself
in
no
other
aspect
than
that
of
a
stern
haughty
misanthrope
from
the
society
of
men
and
most
of
all
from
that
of
englishmen
the
more
beautiful
and
genial
inspirations
of
his
muse
were
looked
upon
but
as
lucid
intervals
between
the
paroxysms
of
an
inherent
malignancy
of
nature
but
how
totally
all
this
differed
from
the
byron
of
the
social
hour
they
who
lived
in
familiar
intercourse
with
him
may
be
safely
left
to
tell
as
it
was
no
english
gentleman
ever
approached
him
with
the
common
forms
of
introduction
that
did
not
come
away
at
once
surprised
and
charmed
by
the
kind
courtesy
of
his
manners
the
unpretending
play
of
his
conversation
and
on
nearer
intercourse
the
frank
youthful
spirits
to
the
flow
of
which
he
gave
way
with
such
zest
as
to
produce
the
impression
that
gaiety
was
after
all
the
true
bent
of
his
disposition
scott
writing
of
him
after
his
death
says
in
talents
he
was
unequalled
and
his
faults
were
those
rather
of
a
bizarre
temper
arising
from
an
eager
and
irritable
nervous
habit
than
any
depravity
of
disposition
he
was
devoid
of
selfishness
which
i
take
to
be
the
basest
ingredient
in
the
human
composition
he
was
generous
humane
and
when
passion
did
not
blind
him
about
this
time
the
great
struggle
of
the
greeks
to
shake
off
the
ottoman
yoke
was
in
progress
i
have
already
in
another
volume
attempted
to
give
the
facts
in
relation
to
that
memorable
movement
christendom
sympathized
with
the
gallant
but
apparently
hopeless
struggle
of
a
weak
nation
to
secure
its
independence
both
from
a
sentiment
of
admiration
for
the
freedom
of
ancient
greece
in
the
period
of
its
highest
glories
and
from
the
love
of
liberty
which
animated
the
liberal
classes
amid
the
political
convulsions
of
the
day
but
the
governments
of
europe
were
loath
to
complicate
the
difficulties
which
existed
between
nations
in
that
stormy
period
and
dared
not
extend
any
open
aid
to
struggling
greece
beyond
giving
their
moral
aid
to
the
greek
cause
lest
it
should
embroil
europe
in
war
of
which
she
was
weary
less
than
ten
years
had
elapsed
since
europe
had
combined
to
dethrone
napoleon
and
some
of
her
leading
powers
like
austria
and
russia
had
a
detestation
of
popular
insurrections
in
this
complicated
state
of
political
affairs
when
any
indiscretion
on
the
part
of
friendly
governments
might
kindle
anew
the
flames
of
war
lord
byron
was
living
in
genoa
taking
such
an
interest
in
the
greek
struggle
that
he
abandoned
poetry
for
politics
he
had
always
sympathized
with
enslaved
nations
struggling
for
independence
and
was
driven
from
ravenna
on
account
of
his
alliance
with
the
revolutionary
society
of
the
carbonari
a
new
passion
now
seized
him
he
entered
heart
and
soul
into
the
struggles
of
the
greeks
their
cause
absorbed
him
he
would
aid
them
to
the
full
extent
of
his
means
with
money
and
arms
as
a
private
individual
he
would
be
a
political
or
military
hero
a
man
of
action
not
of
literary
leisure
every
lover
of
liberty
must
respect
byron
noble
aspirations
to
assist
the
greeks
it
was
a
new
field
for
him
but
one
in
which
he
might
retrieve
his
reputation
for
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
his
ruling
passion
was
fame
and
that
he
had
gained
all
he
could
expect
by
his
literary
productions
whether
loved
or
hated
admired
or
censured
his
poetry
had
placed
him
in
the
front
rank
of
literary
geniuses
throughout
the
world
as
a
poet
his
immortality
was
secured
in
literary
efforts
he
had
also
probably
exhausted
himself
he
could
write
nothing
more
which
would
add
to
his
fame
unless
he
took
a
long
rest
and
recreation
he
was
wearied
of
making
poetry
but
by
plunging
into
a
sea
of
fresh
adventures
and
by
giving
a
new
direction
to
his
powers
he
might
be
sufficiently
renovated
in
the
course
of
time
to
write
something
grander
and
nobler
than
even
childe
harold
or
cain
lord
byron
at
this
time
was
only
years
old
a
period
when
most
men
begin
their
best
work
his
constitution
it
is
true
was
impaired
but
he
was
still
full
of
life
and
enterprise
he
could
ride
or
swim
as
well
as
he
ever
could
the
call
of
a
gallant
people
summoned
him
to
arms
and
of
all
nations
he
most
loved
the
greeks
he
was
an
enthusiast
in
their
cause
he
believed
that
the
day
of
their
deliverance
was
at
hand
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
consecrate
his
remaining
energies
to
effect
their
independence
he
opened
a
correspondence
with
the
greek
committee
in
london
he
selected
a
party
including
a
physician
to
sail
with
him
from
geneva
he
raised
a
sum
of
about
and
on
the
of
july
embarked
with
his
small
party
and
eight
servants
on
board
the
hercules
for
greece
after
a
short
delay
at
leghorn
the
poet
reached
cephalonia
on
the
of
july
he
was
enthusiastically
received
by
the
greeks
of
argostoli
the
principal
port
but
deemed
it
prudent
to
remain
there
until
he
could
get
further
intelligence
from
corfu
and
missolonghi
visiting
in
the
interval
some
of
the
neighboring
islands
consecrated
by
the
muse
of
homer
the
dissensions
among
the
greek
leaders
greatly
embarrassed
byron
but
did
not
destroy
his
ardor
he
saw
that
the
people
were
degenerate
faithless
and
stained
with
atrocities
as
disgraceful
as
those
of
the
turks
themselves
he
dared
not
commit
himself
to
any
one
of
the
struggling
envious
parties
which
rallied
round
their
respective
chieftains
he
lingered
for
six
weeks
in
cephalonia
without
the
ordinary
comforts
of
life
yet
against
all
his
habits
rising
at
an
early
hour
and
attending
to
business
negotiating
bills
and
corresponding
with
the
government
so
far
as
there
was
a
recognized
central
power
at
last
after
the
fall
of
corinth
taken
from
the
turks
and
the
arrival
at
missolonghi
of
prince
mavrocordato
the
only
leader
of
the
greeks
worthy
of
the
name
of
statesman
byron
sailed
for
that
city
then
invested
by
a
turkish
fleet
and
narrowly
escaped
capture
here
he
did
all
he
could
to
produce
union
among
the
chieftains
and
took
into
his
pay
five
hundred
suliotes
acting
as
their
leader
he
meditated
an
attack
on
lepanto
which
commanded
the
navigation
of
the
gulf
of
corinth
and
received
from
the
government
a
commission
for
that
enterprise
but
dissensions
among
his
men
and
intrigues
between
rival
generals
prevented
the
execution
of
his
project
it
was
in
missolonghi
that
with
the
memorandum
on
this
day
i
completed
my
year
byron
wrote
his
latest
verses
most
pathetically
regretting
his
youth
and
his
unfortunate
life
but
arousing
himself
to
find
in
a
noble
cause
a
glorious
death
the
fire
that
in
my
bosom
preys
is
like
to
some
volcanic
isle
no
torch
is
kindled
at
its
blaze
a
funeral
pile
awake
not
greece
she
is
awake
awake
my
spirit

through
whom
thy
tastes
its
parent
lake
and
then
strike
home
seek
out
less
often
sought
than
found
a
soldier
grave
for
thee
the
best
then
look
around
and
choose
thy
ground
and
take
thy
rest
vexations
disappointments
and
exposure
to
the
rains
of
february
so
wrought
upon
byron
eager
spirit
and
weakened
body
that
he
was
attacked
by
convulsive
fits
the
physicians
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
that
time
bled
their
patient
several
times
against
the
protest
of
byron
himself
which
reduced
him
to
extreme
weakness
he
rallied
from
the
attack
for
a
time
and
devoted
himself
to
the
affairs
of
greece
hoping
for
the
restoration
of
his
health
when
spring
should
come
he
spent
in
three
months
thirty
thousand
dollars
for
the
cause
into
which
he
had
so
cordially
entered
in
april
he
took
another
cold
from
severe
exposure
and
fever
set
in
to
relieve
which
bleeding
was
again
resorted
to
and
often
repeated
he
was
now
confined
to
his
room
which
he
never
afterwards
left
he
at
last
realized
that
he
was
dying
and
sent
incoherent
messages
to
his
sister
to
his
daughter
and
to
a
few
intimate
friends
the
end
came
on
the
of
april
the
greek
government
rendered
all
the
honor
possible
to
the
illustrious
dead
his
remains
were
transferred
to
england
he
was
not
buried
in
westminster
abbey
however
but
in
the
church
of
hucknal
near
newstead
where
a
tablet
was
erected
to
his
memory
by
his
sister
the
hon
augusta
maria
leigh
so
harold
ends
in
greece
his

fitly

to

i
can
add
but
little
to
what
i
have
already
said
in
reference
to
byron
either
as
to
his
character
or
his
poetry
the
edinburgh
review
which
in
brougham
article
on
his
early
poems
had
stung
him
into
satire
and
aroused
him
to
a
sense
of
his
own
powers
in
later
years
by
hand
gave
a
most
appreciative
account
of
his
poems
while
mourning
over
his
morbid
gloom
that
breathe
and
thoughts
that
burn
are
not
merely
the
ornaments
but
the
common
staple
of
his
poetry
and
he
is
not
inspired
or
impressive
only
in
some
happy
passages
but
through
the
whole
body
and
tissue
of
his
composition
the
keen
insight
and
exceptional
intellect
of
the
goethe
recognized
in
him
the
greatest
talent
of
our
century
his
marvellous
poetic
genius
was
universally
acknowledged
in
his
own
day
and
more
than
that
so
human
was
it
that
it
attracted
the
sympathies
of
all
civilized
nations
and
as
lamartine
said
made
english
literature
known
throughout
europe
byron
poetry
was
politically
influential
also
by
reason
of
its
spirit
arousing
italy
inspiring
the
young
revolutionists
of
germany
and
awaking
a
generous
sympathy
for
greece
without
the
consciousness
of
any
mission
beyond
the
expression
of
his
own
ebullient
nature
this
poet
contributed
no
mean
impulse
to
the
general
emancipation
of
spirit
which
has
signalized
the
nineteenth
century
two
generations
have
passed
away
since
byron
mortal
remains
were
committed
to
the
dust
and
the
verdict
of
his
country
has
not
since
materially
changed
admiration
for
his
genius
the
light
of
lesser
stars
than
he
shines
with
brighter
radiance
what
the
enlightened
verdict
of
mankind
may
be
two
generations
hence
no
living
mortal
can
tell
the
worshippers
of
intellect
may
attempt
to
reverse
or
modify
the
judgment
already
passed
but
the
impressive
truth
remains
that
no
man
however
great
his
genius
will
be
permanently
judged
aside
from
character
when
lord
bacon
left
his
name
and
memory
to
men
charitable
judgments
and
the
next
age
he
probably
had
in
view
his
invaluable
legacy
to
mankind
of
earnest
searchings
after
truth
which
made
him
one
of
the
greatest
of
human
benefactors
how
far
the
poetry
of
byron
has
proved
a
blessing
to
the
world
must
be
left
to
an
abler
critic
than
i
lay
claim
to
be
in
him
the
good
and
evil
went
hand
in
hand
in
the
eternal
warfare
which
ancient
persian
sages
saw
between
the
powers
of
light
and
darkness
in
every
human
soul
a
consciousness
of
which
warfare
made
byron
himself
in
his
saddest
hours
wish
he
had
never
lived
at
all
if
we
could
in
his
life
and
in
his
works
separate
the
evil
from
the
good
and
let
only
the
good
remain
then
his
services
to
literature
could
hardly
be
exaggerated
and
he
would
be
honored
as
the
greatest
english
poet
so

criticism
and
biography
the
now
famous
biography
of
thomas
carlyle
by
froude
shed
a
new
light
on
the
eccentric
scotch
essayist
and
in
some
respects
changed
the
impressions
produced
by
his
own
reminiscences
and
the
letters
of
his
wife
it
is
with
the
aid
of
those
two
brilliant
and
interesting
volumes
on
carlyle
earlier
life
and
life
in
london
issued
about
two
years
after
the
death
of
their
distinguished
subject
that
i
have
rewritten
my
own
view
of
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
the
nineteenth
century
of
the
men
of
genius
who
have
produced
a
great
effect
on
their
own
time
there
is
no
one
concerning
whom
such
fluctuating
opinions
have
prevailed
within
forty
years
as
in
regard
to
carlyle
his
old
admirers
became
his
detractors
and
those
who
first
disliked
him
became
his
friends
when
his
earlier
works
appeared
they
attracted
but
little
general
notice
though
there
were
many
who
saw
in
him
a
new
light
or
a
new
power
to
brush
away
cobwebs
and
shams
and
to
exalt
the
spiritual
and
eternal
in
man
over
all
materialistic
theories
and
worldly
conventionalities
carlyle
miscellanies
essays
published
first
in
the
leading
reviews
when
he
lived
in
his
moorland
retreat
created
enthusiasm
among
young
students
and
genuine
thinkers
of
every
creed
lord

the
new

and
gave
him

lift
carlyle
french
revolution
took
the
world
by
surprise
and
established
his
fame
his
oliver
cromwell
modified
and
perhaps
changed
the
opinions
of
english
and
american
people
respecting
the
great
protector
it
was
then
that
his
popularity
was
greatest
and
that
the
eccentric
genius
of
cheyne
row
so
long
struggling
with
poverty
was
assured
of
a
competence
and
was
received
in
some
of
the
proudest
families
of
the
kingdom
as
a
teacher
and
a
sage
thus
far
he
was
an
optimist
taking
cheerful
views
of
human
life
and
encouraging
those
who
had
noble
aspirations
but
for
some
unaccountable
reason
whether
from
discontent
or
dyspepsia
or
disappointment
or
disgust
with
this
world
carlyle
gradually
became
a
pessimist
and
attacked
all
forms
of
philanthropy
thus
alienating
those
who
had
been
his
warmest
supporters
he
grew
more
bitter
and
morose
until
at
last
he
howled
almost
like
a
madman
and
was
steeped
in
cynicism
and
gloom
he
put
forth
the
doctrine
that
might
was
right
and
that
thrones
belong
to
the
strongest
he
saw
no
reliance
in
governments
save
upon
physical
force
and
expressed
the
most
boundless
contempt
for
all
institutions
established
by
the
people
then
he
wrote
his
frederic
the
great
his
most
ambitious
and
elaborate
production
received
as
an
authority
from
its
marvellous
historical
accuracy
but
not
so
generally
read
as
his
french
revolution
and
not
like
his
cromwell
changing
the
opinions
of
mankind
soon
after
this
the
death
of
his
wife
plunged
him
into
renewed
gloom
from
which
he
never
emerged
and
he
virtually
retired
from
the
world
and
was
lost
sight
of
by
the
younger
generation
until
his
reminiscences
appeared
injudiciously
published
at
his
request
by
his
friend
and
pupil
froude
in
which
his
scorn
and
contempt
for
everybody
and
everything
turned
the
current
of
public
opinion
strongly
against
him
this
was
still
further
increased
when
the
letters
of
his
wife
appeared
carlyle
bitterest
assailants
were
now
agnostics
of
every
shade
and
degree
especially
of
the
humanitarian
school
that
to
which
mill
and
george
eliot
belonged
it
was
seen
that
this
reviler
of
hypocrisy
and
shams
this
disbeliever
in
miracles
and
in
mechanisms
to
save
society
was
after
all
a
believer
in
god
almighty
and
in
immortality
a
stern
advocate
of
justice
and
duty
appealing
to
the
conscience
of
mankind
a
man
who
detested
comte
the
positivist
as
much
as
he
despised
mill
the
agnostic
and
who
exalted
the
old
religion
of
his
fathers
stripped
of
supernaturalism
as
the
only
hope
of
the
world
the
biography
by
froude
while
it
does
not
conceal
the
atrabilious
temperament
of
carlyle
his
bad
temper
his
intense
egotism
his
irritability
his
overweening
pride
his
scorn
his
profound
loneliness
and
sorrow
and
the
deep
gloom
into
which
he
finally
settled
made
clear
at
the
same
time
his
honest
and
tender
nature
his
noble
independence
his
heroic
struggles
with
poverty
of
which
he
never
complained
his
generous
charities
his
conscientiousness
and
allegiance
to
duty
his
constant
labors
amid
disease
and
excessive
nervousness
and
his
profound
and
unvarying
love
for
his
wife
although
he
was
deficient
in
those
small
attentions
and
demonstrations
of
affection
which
are
so
much
prized
by
women
if
it
be
asked
whether
he
was
happy
in
his
domestic
relations
i
would
say
that
he
was
as
much
so
as
such
a
man
could
be
but
it
was
a
physical
and
moral
impossibility
that
with
his
ailments
and
temper
he
be
happy
he
was
not
sent
into
this
world
to
be
happy
but
to
do
a
work
which
only
such
a
man
as
he
could
do
so
displeasing
however
were
the
personal
peculiarities
of
carlyle
that
the
man
can
never
be
popular
this
hyperborean
literary
giant
speaking
a
babylonian
dialect
smiting
remorselessly
all
pretenders
and
quacks
and
even
honest
fools
was
himself
personally
a
bundle
of
contradictions
fierce
and
sad
by
turns
he
was
a
compound
of
diogenes
jeremiah
and
johnson
like
the
grecian
cynic
in
his
contempt
and
scorn
like
the
jewish
prophet
in
his
melancholy
lamentations
like
the
english
moralist
in
his
grim
humor
and
overbearing
dogmatism
it
is
unfortunate
that
we
know
so
much
of
the
man
better
would
it
be
for
his
fame
if
we
knew
nothing
at
all
of
his
habits
and
peculiarities
in
our
blended
admiration
and
contempt
our
minds
are
diverted
from
the
lasting
literary
legacy
he
has
left
which
after
all
is
the
chief
thing
that
concerns
us
the
mortal
man
is
dead
but
his
works
live
the
biography
of
a
great
man
is
interesting
but
his
thoughts
go
coursing
round
the
world
penetrating
even
the
distant
ages
modifying
systems
and
institutions
what
a
mighty
power
is
law
yet
how
little
do
we
know
or
care
comparatively
for
lawgivers
thomas
carlyle
was
born
in
the
year
of
humble
parentage
in
an
obscure
scotch
village
his
father
was
a
much
respected
for
doing
good
work
and
for
his
virtue
and
intelligence
a
rough
rugged
man
who
appreciated
the
value
of
education
although
and
religious
it
would
seem
that
he
was
as
hard
and
undemonstrative
as
an
puritan
farmer
one
of
those
men
who
never
kiss
their
children
or
even
their
wives
before
people
his
mother
also
was
sagacious
and
religious
and
marked
by
great
individuality
of
character
for
these
stern
parents
carlyle
ever
cherished
the
profoundest
respect
and
affection
regularly
visiting
them
once
a
year
wherever
he
might
be
writing
to
them
frequently
and
yielding
as
much
to
their
influence
as
to
that
of
anybody
at
the
age
of
fourteen
the
boy
was
sent
to
the
university
of
edinburgh
with
but
little
money
in
his
pocket
and
forced
to
practise
the
most
rigid
economy
he
did
not
make
a
distinguished
mark
at
college
nor
did
he
cultivate
many
friendships
he
was
reserved
shy
awkward
and
proud
after
leaving
college
he
became
a
with
no
aptness
and
much
disdain
for
his
calling
it
was
then
that
he
formed
the
acquaintance
of
edward
irving
which
ripened
into
the
warmest
friendship
of
his
life
he
was
much
indebted
to
this
celebrated
preacher
for
the
intellectual
impulse
received
from
him
irving
was
at
the
head
of
a
school
at
kirkcaldy
and
carlyle
became
his
assistant
both
these
young
men
were
ambitious
and
aspired
to
like
napoleon
at
the
military
school
of
brienne
they
would
not
have
been
contented
with
anything
less
because
they
were
conscious
of
their
gifts
and
both
attained
their
end
irving
became
the
greatest
preacher
of
his
day
and
carlyle
the
greatest
writer
but
carlyle
had
the
most
greatness
irving
was
led
by
the
demon
of
popularity
into
extravagances
of
utterance
which
destroyed
his
influence
carlyle
on
the
other
hand
never
courted
popularity
but
becoming
bitter
and
cynical
in
the
rugged
road
he
climbed
to
fame
he
too
lost
many
of
his
admirers
in
ceasing
to
be
a
country
schoolmaster
carlyle
did
not
abandon
teaching
he
removed
to
edinburgh
for
the
study
of
divinity
and
supported
himself
by
giving
lessons
he
had
been
destined
by
his
parents
to
be
a
minister
of
the
kirk
of
scotland
but
at
the
age
of
he
entered
upon
a
severe
to
decide
whether
he
honestly
believed
and
could
preach
its
doctrines
weeks
of
intense
struggle
freed
him
from
the
intellectual
bonds
of
the
kirk
but
fastened
upon
him
the
chronic
disorder
of
his
stomach
which
embittered
his
life
and
in
later
years
distorted
his
vision
of
the
world
about
him
at
the
recommendation
of
his
friend
irving
then
preacher
at
hatton
gardens
carlyle
now
became
private
tutor
to
the
son
of
charles
buller
an
merchant
on
a
salary
of
and
the
tutor
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
pupil
political
advancement
as
a
member
of
the
house
of
commons
and
one
of
the
most
promising
men
in
england
about
this
time
carlyle
who
had
been
industriously
studying
german
and
french
published
a
translation
of
legendre
elements
of
geometry
and
in
brought
out
a
life
of
schiller
a
work
that
he
never
thought
much
of
but
which
was
a
very
respectable
performance
in
fact
he
never
thought
much
of
any
of
his
works
they
were
always
behind
his
ideal
he
wrote
slowly
and
took
great
pains
to
be
accurate
and
in
this
respect
he
reminds
us
of
george
eliot
carlyle
had
no
faith
in
rapid
writing
of
any
sort
any
more
than
daniel
webster
had
in
extempore
speaking
after
he
had
become
a
master
of
composition
it
took
him
thirteen
years
of
steady
work
to
write
frederick
the
great
about
the
same
length
of
time
it
took
macaulay
to
write
the
history
of
fifteen
years
of
england
life
whereas
gibbon
wrote
the
whole
of
his
voluminous
and
exhaustive
history
of
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
in
twenty
years
schiller
being
finished
carlyle
was
now
launched
upon
his
as
a
writer
of
books
he
translated
goethe
wilhelm
meister
for
which
he
received
i
do
not
see
the
transcendent
excellence
of
this
novel
except
in
its
original
and
forcible
criticism
and
its
undercurrent
of
philosophy
but
it
is
nevertheless
famous
these
two
works
gave
carlyle
some
literary
reputation
among
scholars
but
not
much
fame
although
carlyle
was
thus
fairly
embarked
on
a
literary
career
the
trade
of
literature
he
always
regarded
as
a
poor
one
and
never
encouraged
a
young
man
to
pursue
it
as
a
profession
unless
forced
into
it
by
his
own
irresistible
impulses
its
nobility
he
ranked
very
high
but
not
its
remunerativeness
he
regarded
it
as
a
luxury
for
the
rich
and
leisurely
but
a
very
thorny
and
discouraging
path
for
a
poor
man
how
few
have
ever
got
a
living
by
it
unless
allied
with
other
callings
as
a
managing
clerk
or
professor
or
lecturer
or
editor
the
finest
productions
of
emerson
were
originally
delivered
as
lectures
novelists
and
dramatists
i
think
are
the
only
class
who
without
doing
anything
else
have
earned
a
comfortable
support
by
their
writings
historians
have
with
very
few
exceptions
been
independent
in
their
circumstances
in
the
year
at
the
age
of
carlyle
married
jane
welsh
the
only
child
of
a
deceased
physician
of
haddington
who
had
some
little
property
in
expectancy
from
the
profits
of
a
farm
in
the
moorlands
of
scotland
she
was
beautiful
intellectual
and
nervously
intense
she
had
been
a
pupil
of
edward
irving
who
had
introduced
his
friend
carlyle
to
her
on
the
whole
it
was
a
fortunate
marriage
for
carlyle
although
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
have
or
to
give
happiness
in
constant
and
intimate
companionship
with
any
woman
he
was
very
fond
of
his
wife
but
in
an
undemonstrative
sort
of
way
except
in
his
letters
to
her
which
are
genuine
tender
and
considerate
as
in
the
case
of
most
superior
women
clouds
at
times
gathered
over
her
which
her
husband
did
not
or
could
not
dissipate
but
she
was
very
proud
of
him
and
faithful
to
him
and
careful
of
his
interest
and
fame
nor
is
there
evidence
from
her
letters
or
from
the
late
biography
which
froude
has
written
that
she
was
on
the
whole
unhappy
she
was
very
frank
very
sharp
with
her
tongue
and
sometimes
did
not
spare
her
husband
she
had
a
good
deal
to
put
up
with
from
his
irritable
temper
but
she
also
was
irritable
nervous
and
sickly
although
in
her
loyalty
she
rarely
complained
while
she
had
many
privations
to
endure
for
carlyle
until
he
was
nearly
fifty
was
a
poor
man
during
the
first
two
years
of
their
residence
in
london
they
were
obliged
to
live
on
a
year
he
was
never
in
even
moderately
easy
circumstances
until
after
his
oliver
cromwell
was
published
after
his
marriage
carlyle
lived
eighteen
months
near
edinburgh
but
there
was
no
opening
for
him
in
the
exclusive
society
there
his
merits
were
not
then
recognized
as
a
man
of
genius
in
that
cultivated
capital
as
it
was
at
that
time
but
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
jeffrey
who
acknowledged
his
merit
admired
his
wife
and
continued
to
be
as
good
a
friend
as
that
worldly
but
accomplished
man
could
be
to
one
so
far
beneath
him
in
social
rank
the
next
seven
years
of
carlyle
life
were
spent
at
the
scotch
moorland
farm
of
craigenputtock
belonging
to
his
wife
mother
which
must
have
contributed
to
his
support
how
any
brilliant
woman
fond
of
society
as
carlyle
was
could
have
lived
contentedly
in
that
dreary
solitude
fifteen
miles
from
any
visiting
neighbor
or
town
is
a
mystery
she
had
been
delicately
reared
and
the
hard
life
wore
upon
her
health
yet
it
was
here
that
the
young
couple
established
themselves
and
here
that
some
of
the
young
author
best
works
were
written
as
the
miscellanies
and
sartor
resartus
from
here
it
was
that
he
sent
forth
those
magnificent
articles
on
heyne
goethe
novalis
voltaire
burns
and
johnson
which
published
in
the
edinburgh
and
other
reviews
attracted
the
attention
of
the
reading
world
and
excited
boundless
admiration
among
students
the
earlier
of
these
remarkable
productions
like
those
on
burns
and
jean
paul
richter
were
free
from
those
eccentricities
of
style
which
carlyle
persisted
in
retaining
with
amazing
pertinacity
as
he
advanced
in
life
except
again
in
his
letters
to
his
wife
which
are
models
of
clear
writing
the
essay
on
german
literature
appeared
in
the
same
year
a
longer
and
more
valuable
article
a
blended
defence
and
eulogium
of
a
somewhat
similar
in
spirit
to
that
of
madame
de
staël
revelations
twenty
years
before
and
in
which
the
writer
shows
great
admiration
of
german
poetry
and
criticism
perhaps
no
englishman
with
the
possible
exceptions
of
julius
hare
and
coleridge
the
latter
then
a
old
man
had
at
that
time
so
profound
an
acquaintance
as
carlyle
with
german
literature
which
was
his
food
and
life
during
the
seven
years
retirement
on
his
moorland
farm
this
essay
also
was
comparatively
free
from
the
involved
grotesque
but
vivid
style
of
his
later
works
and
it
was
religious
in
its
tone
it
is
mournful
writes
he
to
see
so
many
noble
tender
and
aspiring
minds
deserted
of
that
light
which
once
guided
all
such
mourning
in
the
darkness
because
there
is
no
home
for
the
soul
or
what
is
worse
pitching
tents
among
the
ashes
and
kindling
weak
earthly
lamps
which
we
are
to
take
for
stars
but
this
darkness
is
very
transitory
these
ashes
are
the
soil
of
future
herbage
and
richer
harvests
religion
dwells
in
the
soul
of
man
and
is
as
eternal
as
the
being
of
man
in
this
extract
we
see
the
optimism
which
runs
through
carlyle
earlier
writings
the
faith
in
creation
which
is
to
succeed
destruction
the
immortal
hopes
which
sustain
the
soul
he
believed
in
the
god
of
abraham
and
was
as
far
from
being
a
scoffer
as
the
heavens
are
higher
than
the
earth
he
had
renounced
historical
christianity
but
he
adhered
to
its
essential
spirit
the
next
article
which
carlyle
published
seems
to
have
been
on
werner
followed
the
same
year
by
one
on
goethe
helena
a
continuation
of
his
faust
this
transcendent
work
of
german
art
which
should
be
studied
rather
than
read
is
commented
on
by
the
reviewer
with
boundless
admiration
if
there
was
one
human
being
whom
carlyle
worshipped
it
was
the
dictator
of
german
literature
who
reigned
at
weimar
as
voltaire
had
reigned
at
ferney
if
he
was
not
the
first
to
introduce
the
writings
of
goethe
into
england
he
was
the
great
warmest
admirer
if
goethe
had
faults
they
were
to
carlyle
the
faults
of
a
god
and
he
exalted
him
as
the
greatest
light
of
modern
times
a
new
force
in
the
world
a
new
fire
in
the
soul
who
inaugurated
a
new
era
in
literature
which
went
to
the
heart
of
cultivated
europe
weary
of
the
doubts
and
denials
that
voltaire
had
made
fashionable
it
seemed
to
carlyle
that
goethe
entered
into
the
sorrows
the
solemn
questionings
and
affirmations
of
the
soul
seeking
emancipation
from
dogmas
and
denials
alike
and
in
the
spirit
of
plato
resting
on
the
certitudes
of
a
higher
life
calm
having
subdued
passion
as
he
had
outgrown
cant
full
of
benignity
free
from
sarcasm
a
man
of
mighty
and
deep
experiences
with
knowledge
of
himself
of
the
world
and
the
whole
realm
of
literature
a
great
artist
as
well
as
a
great
genius
seated
on
the
throne
of
letters
not
to
scatter
thunderbolts
but
to
instruct
the
present
and
future
generations
the
next
great
essay
which
carlyle
published
this
time
in
the
edinburgh
review
was
on
burns
a
hackneyed
subject
yet
treated
with
masterly
ability
this
article
in
some
respects
his
best
entirely
free
from
mannerisms
and
affectation
of
style
is
just
in
its
criticism
glowing
with
eloquence
and
full
of
sympathy
with
the
infirmities
of
a
great
poet
showing
a
remarkable
insight
into
what
is
noblest
and
truest
this
essay
is
likely
to
live
for
style
alone
aside
from
its
various
other
merits
it
is
complete
exhaustive
brilliant
such
as
only
a
scotchman
could
have
written
who
was
familiar
with
the
laborious
lives
of
the
peasantry
living
in
the
realm
of
art
and
truth
careless
of
outward
circumstances
and
trappings
and
exalting
only
what
is
immortal
and
lofty
while
carlyle
sees
in
goethe
the
impersonation
of
human
wisdom
in
every
aspect
a
success
outwardly
and
inwardly
serene
and
potent
as
an
olympian
deity
he
sees
in
burns
a
highly
gifted
genius
also
but
yet
a
wreck
and
a
failure
a
man
broken
down
by
the
force
of
that
degrading
habit
which
unfortunately
and
peculiarly
and
even
mysteriously
robs
a
man
of
all
dignity
all
honor
and
all
sense
of
shame
amid
the
misfortunes
the
mistakes
and
the
degradations
of
the
born
poet
whom
he
alike
admires
and
pities
and
mildly
blames
he
sees
also
the
noble
elements
of
the
poet
gifted
soul
and
loves
him
especially
for
his
sincerity
which
next
to
labor
he
uniformly
praises
it
was
the
truthfulness
he
saw
in
burns
which
constrained
affection
the
poet
sympathy
and
humanity
speaking
out
of
his
heart
in
unconscious
earnestness
and
plaintive
melody
sad
and
sorrowful
of
course
since
his
life
was
an
unsuccessful
battle
with
himself
but
free
from
egotism
and
full
of
a
love
which
no
misery
could
crush
so
unlike
that
other
greatest
poet
of
our
century
whose
exemplar
was
satan
the
hero
of
his
poetry
and
the
model
of
his
life
in
this
most
beautiful
and
finished
essay
carlyle
paints
the
man
in
his
true
colors
sinning
and
sinned
against
courageous
while
yielding
poor
but
proud
scornful
yet
affectionate
singing
in
matchless
lyrics
the
sentiments
of
the
people
from
whom
he
sprung
and
among
whom
he
died
which
lyrics
though
but
fragments
indeed
are
precious
and
imperishable
in
the
same
year
appeared
the
life
of
heyne
the
great
german
scholar
pushing
his
way
from
the
depths
of
poverty
and
obscurity
by
force
of
patient
industry
and
genius
to
a
proud
position
and
a
national
fame
let
no
unfriended
son
of
genius
despair
exclaims
carlyle
if
he
have
the
will
the
power
will
not
be
denied
him
like
the
acorn
carelessly
cast
abroad
in
the
wilderness
yet
it
rises
to
be
an
oak
on
the
wild
soil
it
nourishes
itself
it
defies
the
tempest
and
lives
for
a
thousand
years
the
whole
outward
life
of
carlyle
himself
like
that
of
heyne
was
an
example
of
heroism
amid
difficulties
and
hope
amid
the
storms
the
next
noticeable
article
which
carlyle
published
was
on
voltaire
and
appeared
in
the
quarterly
review
in
it
would
appear
that
he
hoped
to
find
in
this
great
oracle
and
guide
of
the
eighteenth
century
something
to
admire
and
praise
commensurate
with
his
great
fame
but
vainly
voltaire
though
fortunate
beyond
example
in
literary
history
versatile
laborious
brilliant
in
style
poet
satirist
historian
and
essayist
seemed
to
carlyle
to
be
superficial
irreligious
and
egotistical
the
critic
ascribes
his
power
to
ridicule
a
lucian
who
destroyed
but
did
not
reconstruct
worldly
material
sceptical
defiant
utterly
lacking
that
earnestness
without
which
nothing
permanently
great
can
be
effected
carlyle
says
voltaire
read
history
not
with
the
eye
of
a
devout
seer
or
even
critic
but
through
a
pair
of
mere
spectacles
it
is
not
a
mighty
drama
enacted
on
the
theatre
of
infinitude
with
suns
for
lamps
and
eternity
as
a
background
whose
author
is
god
and
whose
purport
leads
to
the
throne
of
god
but
a
poor
wearisome
dispute
spun
through
ten
centuries
between
the
encyclopédie
and
the
sorbonne
carlyle
essays
for
the
next
two
years
chiefly
on
german
literature
which
he
admired
and
sought
to
introduce
to
his
countrymen
were
published
in
various
reviews
i
can
only
allude
to
one
on
richter
whose
whimsicality
of
style
he
unconsciously
copied
and
whose
original
ideas
he
made
his
own
in
this
essay
carlyle
introduced
to
the
english
people
a
great
german
but
a
grotesque
whose
writings
will
probably
never
be
read
much
out
of
germany
excellent
as
they
are
on
account
of
the
jarring
combination
of
parentheses
dashes
hyphens
figures
without
limit
one
tissue
of
metaphors
and
similes
interlaced
with
epigrammatic
bursts
and
sardonic
turns
a
heterogeneous
unparalleled
imbroglio
of
perplexity
and
extravagance
there
was
another
on
schiller
not
an
idol
to
carlyle
as
goethe
was
yet
a
great
poet
and
a
true
man
with
deep
insight
and
intense
earnestness
his
works
said
carlyle
and
the
memory
of
what
he
was
will
arise
afar
off
like
a
towering
landmark
in
the
solitude
of
the
past
when
distance
shall
have
dwarfed
into
invisibility
many
lesser
people
that
once
encompassed
him
and
hid
them
forever
from
the
near
beholder
thus
far
carlyle
had
confined
himself
to
biography
and
essays
on
german
literature
in
which
his
extraordinary
insight
is
seen
but
now
he
enters
another
field
and
writes
a
strictly
original
essay
called
characteristics
published
in
the
edinburgh
review
in
the
prolific
year
of
in
which
essay
we
see
the
germs
of
his
philosophy
the
article
is
hard
to
read
and
is
disfigured
by
obscurities
which
leave
a
doubt
on
the
mind
of
the
reader
as
to
whether
the
author
understood
the
subject
about
which
he
was
writing
for
carlyle
was
not
a
philosopher
but
a
painter
and
there
is
no
stream
of
logic
running
consistently
through
his
writings
in
characteristics
he
seems
to
have
had
merely
glimpses
of
great
truths
which
he
could
not
clearly
express
and
which
won
him
the
reputation
of
being
a
german
transcendentalist
its
leading
idea
is
the
commonplace
one
of
the
progress
of
society
which
no
sane
and
christian
man
has
ever
seriously
questioned
not
an
uninterrupted
progress
but
a
general
advance
brought
about
by
christian
ideas
any
other
view
of
progress
is
dreary
and
discouraging
nor
is
this
inconsistent
with
great
catastrophes
and
national
backslidings
with
the
fall
of
empires
and
french
revolutions
we
note
at
this
time
in
carlyle
writings
on
the
whole
a
cheerful
view
of
human
life
in
spite
of
sorrows
hardships
and
disappointments
which
are
made
by
divine
providence
to
act
as
healthy
discipline
we
see
nothing
of
the
angry
pessimism
of
his
later
writings
those
years
at
craigenputtock
were
healthy
and
wholesome
he
labored
in
hope
and
had
great
intellectual
and
artistic
enjoyment
which
reconciled
him
to
solitude
the
chief
evil
with
which
he
had
to
contend
after
dyspepsia
his
habits
were
frugal
but
poverty
did
not
stare
him
in
the
face
since
he
had
the
income
of
the
farm
it
does
not
appear
that
the
deep
gloom
which
subsequently
came
over
his
soul
oppressed
him
in
his
moorland
retreat
he
did
not
sympathize
with
any
religion
of
denials
but
felt
that
out
of
the
jargon
of
false
and
pretentious
philosophies
would
come
at
last
a
positive
belief
which
would
once
more
enthrone
god
in
the
world
after
writing
another
characteristic
article
on
biography
he
furnished
for
fraser
magazine
one
of
the
finest
biographical
portraits
ever
painted
that
of
johnson
in
which
that
cyclopean
worker
stands
out
with
even
more
distinctness
than
in
boswell
life
as
one
of
the
most
honest
earnest
patient
laborers
in
the
whole
field
of
literature
carlyle
makes
us
almost
love
this
man
in
spite
of
his
awkwardness
dogmatism
and
petulance
johnson
in
his
day
was
an
acknowledged
dictator
on
all
literary
questions
surrounded
by
admirers
of
the
highest
gifts
who
did
homage
to
his
learning
a
man
of
more
striking
individuality
than
any
other
celebrity
in
england
and
a
man
of
intense
religious
convictions
in
an
age
of
religious
indifference
we
now
wonder
why
this
struggling
poorly
paid
and
disagreeable
man
of
letters
should
have
had
such
an
ascendency
over
men
superior
to
himself
in
learning
genius
and
culture
as
burke
and
gibbon
doubtless
were
even
goldsmith
whom
he
snubbed
and
loved
is
now
more
popular
than
he
it
was
the
heroism
of
his
character
which
carlyle
so
much
admired
and
so
vividly
described
contending
with
so
many
difficulties
yet
surmounting
them
all
by
his
persistent
industry
and
noble
aspirations
never
losing
faith
in
himself
or
his
maker
never
servilely
bowing
down
to
rank
and
wealth
as
others
did
and
maintaining
his
in
whatever
condition
he
was
placed
in
this
delightful
biography
we
are
made
to
see
the
superiority
of
character
to
genius
and
the
dignity
of
labor
when
idleness
was
the
coveted
desire
of
most
fortunate
men
as
well
as
the
almost
universal
vice
of
the
magnates
of
the
land
labor
to
the
mind
of
johnson
as
well
as
to
that
of
carlyle
is
not
only
honorable
but
is
a
necessity
which
nature
imposes
as
the
condition
of
happiness
and
usefulness
nor
does
carlyle
sneer
at
the
wedded
life
of
johnson
made
up
of
drizzle
and
dry
weather
but
reverences
his
fidelity
to
his
best
friend
uninteresting
as
she
was
to
the
world
and
his
plaintive
and
touching
grief
when
she
passed
away
carlyle
in
this
essay
exalts
a
life
of
letters
however
poorly
paid
which
pope
in
his
dunciad
did
so
much
to
depreciate
showing
how
it
contributes
to
the
elevation
of
a
nation
and
to
those
lofty
pleasures
which
no
wealth
can
purchase
but
it
is
the
moral
dignity
of
johnson
which
the
essay
makes
to
shine
most
conspicuously
in
his
character
supported
as
he
was
by
the
truths
of
religion
in
which
under
all
circumstances
he
proudly
glories
and
without
which
he
must
have
made
shipwreck
of
himself
amid
so
many
discouragements
maladies
and
embarrassments
for
his
greatest
labors
were
made
with
poverty
distress
and
obscurity
for
his
companions
until
at
last
victorious
over
every
external
evil
and
vile
temptation
he
emerged
into
the
realm
of
peace
and
light
and
became
an
oracle
and
a
sage
wherever
he
chose
to
go
johnson
was
the
greatest
master
of
conversation
in
his
day
whose
detached
sayings
are
still
quoted
more
often
than
his
most
elaborate
periods
i
apprehend
that
there
was
a
great
contrast
between
writings
and
his
conversation
while
the
former
are
ciceronian
his
talk
was
epigrammatic
terse
and
direct
and
its
charm
and
power
were
in
his
pointed
and
vehement
saxon
style
had
he
talked
as
he
wrote
he
would
have
been
wearisome
and
pedantic
still
like
coleridge
and
robert
hall
he
preached
rather
than
conversed
thinking
what
he
himself
should
say
rather
than
paying
attention
to
what
others
said
except
to
combat
and
rebuke
them
a
discourser
as
macaulay
was
not
one
to
suggest
interchange
of
ideas
as
addison
did
but
neither
power
of
conversation
nor
learning
would
have
made
johnson
a
literary
dictator
his
power
was
in
the
force
of
his
character
his
earnestness
and
sincerity
even
more
than
in
his
genius
i
will
not
dwell
on
the
other
review
articles
which
carlyle
wrote
in
his
isolated
retreat
since
published
as
miscellanies
on
which
his
fame
in
no
small
degree
rests
even
as
the
essays
of
macaulay
may
be
read
when
his
more
elaborate
history
will
lie
neglected
on
the
shelves
of
libraries
carlyle
put
his
soul
into
these
miscellanies
and
the
labor
and
enjoyment
of
writing
made
him
partially
forget
his
ailments
i
look
upon
those
years
at
craigenputtock
as
the
brightest
and
healthiest
of
his
life
removed
as
he
was
from
the
sight
of
levities
and
follies
which
tormented
his
soul
and
irritated
his
temper
carlyle
contrived
to
save
about
from
his
literary
earnings
so
frugal
was
his
life
and
so
free
from
temptations
his
recreation
was
in
wandering
on
foot
or
horseback
over
the
silent
moors
and
unending
hills
watered
by
nameless
rills
and
shadowed
by
mists
and
vapors
his
life
was
solitary
but
not
more
so
than
that
of
moses
amid
the
deserts
of
midian
isolation
indeed
but
in
which
the
highest
wisdom
is
matured
into
this
retreat
emerson
penetrated
a
young
man
with
boundless
enthusiasm
for
his
teacher
for
carlyle
was
a
teacher
to
him
as
to
hundreds
of
others
in
this
country
carlyle
never
had
a
truer
and
better
friend
than
emerson
who
opened
to
him
the
great
reward
of
recognition
in
distant
america
while
yet
his
own
land
refused
to
take
knowledge
of
him
and
this
friendship
continued
to
the
end
an
honor
to
both
for
carlyle
never
saw
in
emerson
writings
the
genius
and
wisdom
which
his
american
friend
admired
in
the
scottish
sage
nor
were
their
opinions
so
harmonious
as
some
suppose
emerson
despised
calvinism
and
had
no
definite
opinions
on
any
theological
subject
carlyle
was
a
calvinist
without
the
theology
of
calvinism
if
that
be
possible
he
did
not
indeed
believe
in
historical
christianity
but
he
had
the
profoundest
convictions
of
an
overruling
god
reigning
in
justice
and
making
the
wrath
of
man
to
praise
him
carlyle
too
despised
everything
visionary
and
indefinite
and
had
more
respect
for
what
is
brought
about
by
revolution
than
by
evolution
but
of
all
things
he
held
in
profoundest
abhorrence
the
dreary
theories
of
materialists
and
political
economists
it
was
the
spirit
and
not
the
body
which
stood
out
in
his
eyes
as
of
most
importance
it
was
the
manly
virtues
which
he
reverenced
in
man
not
his
clothes
and
surroundings
and
it
was
on
this
lofty
spiritual
plane
that
carlyle
and
emerson
stood
in
complete
harmony
together
i
can
not
quit
this
part
of
carlyle
life
without
mention
of
what
i
conceive
to
be
his
most
original
and
remarkable
production
sartor
resartus
the
stitcher
restitched
or
the
tailor
done
over
the
title
of
an
old
scotch
song
it
is
a
quaintly
conceived
reproduction
of
the
work
of
an
imaginary
german
professor
on
the
philosophy
of
clothes
under
which
external
figure
he
includes
all
institutions
customs
beliefs
in
which
humanity
has
draped
itself
as
distinguished
from
the
inner
reality
of
man
himself
the
beginning
of
all
wisdom
he
says
is
to
look
fixedly
on
clothes
or
even
with
armed
eyesight
till
they
become
and
thus
in
grotesque
fashion
with
amazing
vigor
he
ranges
the
universe
in
search
of
the
real
in
one
of
his
letters
to
emerson
carlyle
discussing
a
project
of
lecturing
in
america
takes
on
his
sartorial
professor
name
and
writes
could
any
one
but
appoint
me
lecturing
professor
of
science
in
general
this
work
was
written
in
his
remote
solitude
yet
not
published
for
years
after
it
was
finished
and
for
the
best
of
reasons
because
with
all
his
literary
repute
carlyle
could
not
find
a
publisher
the
sartor
was
not
appreciated
and
carlyle
knowing
its
value
locked
it
up
in
his
drawer
and
waited
for
his
time
the
sartor
resartus
is
a
sort
of
prose
poem
written
with
the
blood
vivid
as
fire
in
a
dark
night
a
dantean
production
a
revelation
probably
of
the
author
own
struggles
and
experiences
from
the
dark
gulf
of
the
everlasting
nay
to
the
clear
and
serene
heights
of
the
everlasting
yea
to
me
the
book
is
full
of
consolation
and
encouragement
a
battle
of
the
spirit
with
infernal
doubts
a
victory
over
despair
over
all
external
evils
and
all
spiritual
foes
it
is
also
a
bold
and
grotesque
but
scorching
sarcasm
of
the
conventionalities
and
hypocrisies
of
society
and
a
savage
thrust
at
those
quackeries
which
seem
to
reign
in
this
world
in
spite
of
their
falsity
and
shallowness
it
is
not
i
grant
easy
to
read
it
is
full
of
conceits
and
affectations
of
style
a
puzzle
to
some
a
rebuke
to
others
every
page
of
this
unique
collection
of
confessions
and
meditations
of
passionate
invective
and
solemn
reflection
is
stamped
with
the
seal
of
genius
and
yet
was
the
last
of
carlyle
writings
to
be
appreciated
i
believe
that
this
is
the
ordinary
fate
of
truly
original
works
those
that
are
destined
to
live
the
longest
especially
if
they
burn
no
incense
to
the
idols
of
prevailing
worship
and
be
characterized
by
a
style
which
to
say
the
least
is
extraordinary
flashy
brilliant
witty
yet
superficial
pictures
of
external
life
which
everybody
has
seen
and
knows
are
the
soonest
to
find
admirers
but
a
revelation
of
what
is
not
seen
this
is
the
work
of
seers
and
prophets
whose
ordinary
destiny
has
been
anything
other
than
to
wear
soft
raiment
and
sit
in
king
palaces
the
sartor
was
at
last
in
printed
in
fraser
magazine
meeting
no
appreciation
in
england
but
very
enthusiastically
received
by
emerson
channing
ripley
and
a
group
of
advanced
thinkers
in
new
england
through
whose
efforts
it
was
published
here
in
book
form
and
so
in
spite
of
timid
london
publishers
it
drifted
back
to
london
and
a
fame
in
our
time
sixty
years
later
it
sells
by
scores
of
thousands
annually
in
cheap
and
in
luxurious
editions
throughout
the
world
in
respect
of
early
recognition
and
popularity
carlyle
differs
from
his
great
contemporary
macaulay
who
was
so
immediately
and
so
magnificently
rewarded
and
yet
received
no
more
than
his
due
as
the
finest
prose
writer
of
his
day
macaulay
essays
are
generally
of
remarkable
men
and
remarkable
events
but
of
men
of
action
rather
than
of
quiet
meditation
his
heroes
are
such
men
as
clive
and
hastings
and
pitt
not
such
men
as
pascal
or
augustine
or
leibnitz
or
goethe
but
carlyle
in
his
heroes
paints
the
struggling
soul
in
its
deepest
aspirations
and
the
truths
evolved
by
profound
meditations
these
are
not
such
as
gain
instant
popular
acceptance
yet
they
are
the
the
time
came
at
last
for
carlyle
to
leave
his
retirement
among
moors
and
hills
and
in
he
directed
his
steps
to
london
spending
the
winter
with
his
wife
in
the
great
centre
of
english
life
and
thought
and
being
well
received
so
that
in
he
removed
permanently
to
the
metropolis
but
he
was
scarcely
less
buried
at
his
modest
house
in
chelsea
than
he
had
been
on
his
farm
for
he
came
to
london
with
only
and
was
obliged
to
practise
the
most
rigid
economy
for
two
years
he
labored
in
his
london
workshop
without
earning
a
shilling
and
with
a
limited
acquaintance
not
yet
was
his
society
sought
by
the
great
world
which
he
mocked
and
despised
he
fortunately
had
the
genial
and
agreeable
leigh
hunt
for
a
neighbor
and
edward
irving
for
his
friend
he
was
known
to
the
critics
by
his
writings
but
his
circle
of
personal
friends
was
small
he
was
more
or
less
intimate
with
john
stuart
mill
charles
austin
sir
william
molesworth
and
the
advanced
section
of
the
philosophical
radicals
the
very
class
of
men
from
whom
he
afterwards
was
most
estranged
none
of
these
men
forwarded
his
fortunes
but
they
lent
him
books
and
helped
him
at
the
libraries
for
no
carpenter
can
work
without
tools
the
work
to
which
carlyle
now
devoted
himself
was
a
history
of
the
french
revolution
the
principal
characters
of
which
he
had
already
studied
and
written
about
it
was
a
subject
adapted
to
his
genius
for
dramatic
writing
and
for
the
presentation
of
his
views
as
to
retribution
his
whole
theology
according
to
froude
was
underlaid
by
the
belief
in
punishment
for
sin
which
was
impressed
upon
his
mind
by
his
parents
and
was
one
of
his
firmest
convictions
the
french
were
to
his
mind
the
greatest
sinners
among
christian
nations
and
therefore
were
to
reap
a
fearful
penalty
to
paint
in
a
new
and
impressive
form
the
inevitable
calamities
attendant
on
violated
law
and
justice
was
the
aspiration
of
carlyle
he
had
money
enough
to
last
him
with
economy
for
two
years
in
this
time
he
hoped
to
complete
his
work
the
possibility
was
due
to
the
intelligent
thrift
of
his
wife
commenting
on
one
of
her
letters
describing
their
snug
little
house
he
writes
from
birth
upwards
she
had
lived
in
opulence
and
now
for
my
sake
had
become
poor
so
nobly
poor
truly
her
pretty
little
brag
in
this
letter
was
well
founded
no
such
house
for
beautiful
thrift
quiet
spontaneous
nay
as
it
were
unconscious
minimum
of
money
reconciled
to
human
comfort
and
human
dignity
have
i
anywhere
looked
upon
he
devoted
himself
to
his
task
with
intense
interest
and
was
completely
preoccupied
in
the
winter
of
after
a
year
of
general
study
collection
of
material
and
writing
and
at
last
by
dint
of
continual
endeavor
for
many
weary
weeks
the
first
volume
was
completed
and
submitted
to
his
friend
mill
the
valuable
manuscript
was
accidentally
and
ignorantly
destroyed
by
a
servant
and
mill
was
in
despair
carlyle
bore
the
loss
like
a
hero
he
did
not
chide
or
repine
if
his
spirit
sunk
within
him
it
was
when
he
was
alone
in
his
library
or
in
the
society
of
his
sympathizing
wife
he
generously
writes
to
emerson
i
could
not
complain
or
the
poor
man
would
have
shot
himself
we
had
to
gather
ourselves
together
and
show
a
smooth
front
to
it
which
happily
though
difficult
was
not
impossible
to
do
i
began
again
at
the
beginning
to
such
a
wretched
paralyzing
torpedo
of
a
task
as
my
hand
never
found
to
do
mill
made
all
the
reparation
possible
he
gave
his
friend
but
carlyle
would
accept
only
few
men
could
have
rewritten
with
any
heart
that
first
volume
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
revive
sufficient
interest
the
precious
inspiration
would
have
been
wanting
yet
carlyle
manfully
accomplished
his
task
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
second
writing
was
better
than
the
first
that
he
probably
left
out
what
was
unessential
and
made
a
more
condensed
narrative
a
more
complete
picture
for
his
memory
was
singularly
retentive
i
do
not
believe
that
any
man
can
do
his
best
at
the
first
heat
see
how
the
great
poets
revise
and
rewrite
brougham
rewrote
his
celebrated
peroration
on
the
trial
of
queen
caroline
seventeen
times
carlyle
had
to
rewrite
his
book
but
his
materials
remained
his
great
pictures
were
all
in
his
mind
in
this
second
writing
there
may
have
been
less
emotion
less
fire
in
his
descriptions
but
there
was
fire
enough
for
his
vivacity
was
excessive
even
work
could
be
pruned
not
by
others
but
by
himself
the
household
at
chelsea
was
never
closer
drawn
together
than
in
those
times
of
trial
carlyle
lost
time
and
spirits
but
he
could
afford
the
loss
the
entire
work
was
delayed
but
was
done
at
last
the
final
sentence
of
vol
iii
was
written
at
ten
on
a
damp
evening
january
this
great
work
the
most
ambitious
and
famous
of
all
writings
and
in
many
respects
his
best
was
not
received
by
the
public
with
the
enthusiam
it
ought
to
have
awakened
it
was
not
appreciated
by
the
people
at
large
ordinary
readers
were
not
enraptured
by
the
iliad
swiftness
and
vividness
of
the
narrative
its
sustained
passion
the
flow
of
poetry
the
touches
of
grandeur
and
tenderness
and
the
masterly
touches
by
which
he
made
the
great
actors
stand
out
in
their
individuality
it
seemed
to
many
to
be
extravagant
exaggerated
at
war
with
all
the
feudalities
of
literature
partisans
of
all
kinds
were
offended
the
style
was
startlingly
broken
almost
savage
in
strength
vivid
and
distinct
as
lightning
doubtless
the
man
himself
had
grown
away
from
the
quieter
moods
of
his
earlier
essays
froude
quotes
this
from
carlyle
journal
the
poor
people
seem
to
think
a
style
can
be
put
off
or
on
not
like
a
skin
but
like
a
coat
is
not
a
skin
verily
a
product
and
close
kinsfellow
of
all
that
lies
under
it
exact
type
of
the
nature
of
the
beast
not
to
be
plucked
off
without
flaying
and
death
the
public
is
an
old
woman
let
her
maunder
and
mumble
but
the
extraordinary
merits
of
the
book
made
a
great
impression
on
the
cultivated
intellects
of
england
such
men
as
jeffrey
macaulay
southey
hallam
brougham
thackeray
dickens
who
saw
and
admitted
that
a
great
genius
had
arisen
whether
they
agreed
with
his
views
or
not
in
america
we
may
be
proud
to
say
the
work
created
general
enthusiasm
and
its
republication
through
emerson
efforts
brought
some
money
as
well
as
larger
fame
to
its
author
of
the
first
moneys
that
emerson
sent
carlyle
as
fruits
of
this
adventure
the
dyspeptic
scotchman
wrote
that
he
was
to
buy
myself
a
sharp
little
nag
with
twenty
of
these
pounds
and
ride
him
till
the
other
thirty
be
eaten
i
will
call
the
creature
my
kind
friends
and
was
duly
bought
and
ridden
carlyle
still
remained
in
straitened
circumstances
although
his
reputation
was
now
established
in
order
to
assist
him
in
his
great
necessities
his
friends
got
up
lectures
for
him
which
were
attended
by
the
of
london
he
gave
several
courses
in
successive
years
during
the
london
season
which
brought
him
more
money
than
his
writings
at
that
time
gave
him
personal
and
added
largely
to
his
circle
of
admirers
his
second
course
of
twelve
lectures
brought
him
a
year
harvest
and
a
large
sum
for
lectures
in
england
where
the
literary
institutions
rarely
paid
over
for
a
single
lecture
even
in
later
times
the
philosophical
society
of
edinburgh
which
commanded
the
finest
talent
paid
only
to
such
men
as
froude
and
the
archbishop
of
york
but
lecturing
to
many
men
an
agreeable
excitement
seems
to
have
been
very
unpleasant
to
carlyle
even
repulsive
though
the
lectures
brought
both
money
and
fame
he
abominated
the
delivery
of
them
they
broke
his
rest
destroyed
his
peace
of
mind
and
depressed
his
spirits
nothing
but
direst
necessity
reconciled
him
to
the
disagreeable
task
he
never
took
any
satisfaction
or
pride
in
his
success
in
this
field
nor
was
his
success
probably
legitimate
people
went
to
see
him
as
a
new
literary
lion
to
hear
him
roar
not
to
be
edified
he
had
no
peculiar
qualification
for
public
speaking
and
he
affected
to
despise
it
very
few
english
men
of
letters
have
had
this
gift
indeed
popular
eloquence
is
at
a
discount
among
the
cultivated
classes
in
england
they
prefer
to
read
at
their
leisure
popular
eloquence
best
thrives
in
democracies
as
in
that
of
ancient
athens
aristocrats
disdain
it
and
fear
it
in
their
contempt
for
it
they
even
affect
hesitation
and
stammering
not
only
when
called
upon
to
speak
in
public
but
also
in
social
converse
until
the
halting
style
has
come
to
be
known
among
americans
as
very
english
in
absolute
monarchies
eloquence
is
rare
except
in
the
pulpit
or
at
the
bar
cicero
would
have
had
no
field
and
would
not
probably
have
been
endured
in
the
reign
of
nero
yet
bossuet
and
bourdaloue
were
the
delight
of
louis
xiv
what
would
that
monarch
have
said
to
the
speeches
of
mirabeau
after
the
publication
in
of
the
french
revolution
that
roaring
conflagration
of
anarchies
that
series
of
graphic
pictures
rather
than
a
history
or
even
a
criticism
it
was
some
time
before
carlyle
could
settle
down
upon
another
great
work
he
delivered
lectures
wrote
tracts
and
essays
gave
vent
to
his
humors
and
nursed
his
ailments
he
was
now
famous
a
man
whom
everybody
wished
to
see
and
know
especially
americans
when
they
came
to
london
but
whom
he
generally
snubbed
as
he
did
me
and
pronounced
them
bores
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
monckton
milnes
afterward
lord
houghton
who
invited
him
to
breakfast
where
he
met
other
notabilities
among
them
bunsen
the
prussian
ambassador
at
london
lord
mahon
the
historian
and
baring
afterward
lord
ashburton
the
warmest
and
the
truest
of
his
friends
who
extended
to
him
the
most
generous
hospitalities
carlyle
was
now
in
what
is
called
high
society
and
was
taking
life
easy
writing
but
little
yet
reading
much
especially
about
oliver
cromwell
whose
life
he
thought
of
writing
his
lectures
at
this
period
were
more
successful
than
ever
attended
by
great
and
fashionable
people
and
from
them
his
chief
income
was
derived
while
collecting
materials
for
his
life
of
cromwell
carlyle
became
deeply
interested
in
the
movements
of
the
chartists
composed
chiefly
of
with
socialistic
tendencies
he
was
called
a
radical
and
he
did
believe
in
a
radical
reform
of
men
lives
especially
of
the
upper
classes
who
showed
but
little
sympathy
for
the
poor
he
was
not
satisfied
with
the
whigs
who
believed
that
the
reform
bill
would
usher
in
a
political
millennium
he
had
more
sympathy
with
the
conservative
tories
than
the
liberal
whigs
but
his
opinions
were
not
acceptable
to
either
of
the
great
political
parties
they
alike
distrusted
him
even
mill
had
a
year
before
declined
an
article
on
the
working
classes
for
his
review
the
westminster
carlyle
took
it
to
lockhart
of
the
quarterly
but
lockhart
was
afraid
to
publish
it
mill
then
about
to
leave
the
westminster
wished
to
insert
it
as
a
final
shout
but
carlyle
declined
and
in
expanded
his
article
into
a
book
called
chartism
which
was
rapidly
sold
and
loudly
noticed
it
gave
but
little
satisfaction
however
it
offended
the
conservatives
by
exposing
sores
that
could
not
be
healed
while
on
the
other
hand
the
radicals
did
not
wish
to
be
told
that
men
were
far
from
being
equal
that
in
fact
they
were
very
unequal
and
that
society
could
not
be
advanced
by
debating
clubs
or
economical
theories
but
only
by
gifted
individuals
as
instruments
of
divine
providence
guiding
mankind
by
their
superior
wisdom
these
views
were
expanded
in
a
new
course
of
lectures
on
heroes
and
hero
worship
and
subsequently
printed
the
most
able
and
suggestive
of
all
carlyle
lectures
delivered
in
the
spring
of
with
great
he
never
appeared
on
the
platform
again
lecturing
as
we
have
said
was
not
to
his
taste
he
preferred
to
earn
his
living
by
his
pen
and
his
writings
had
now
begun
to
yield
a
comfortable
support
he
received
on
account
of
them
from
america
alone
thanks
to
the
influence
of
his
friend
emerson
carlyle
now
began
to
weary
of
the
distraction
of
london
life
and
pined
for
the
country
but
his
wife
would
not
hear
a
word
about
it
she
had
had
enough
of
the
country
at
craigenputtock
meanwhile
preparations
for
the
life
of
cromwell
went
on
slowly
varied
by
visits
to
his
relatives
in
scotland
travels
on
the
continent
and
interviews
with
distinguished
men
his
mind
at
this
period
was
most
occupied
with
the
sad
condition
of
the
english
people
everywhere
riots
disturbances
physical
suffering
and
abject
poverty
among
the
masses
for
the
corn
laws
had
not
then
been
repealed
and
to
carlyle
vision
there
was
a
most
melancholy
prospect
ahead
not
revolution
but
universal
degradation
and
the
reign
of
injustice
this
sad
condition
of
the
people
was
contrasted
in
his
mind
with
what
it
had
been
centuries
before
as
it
appeared
from
an
old
book
which
he
happened
to
read
jocelin
chronicles
which
painted
english
life
in
the
twelfth
century
he
fancied
that
the
world
was
going
on
from
bad
to
worse
and
in
this
gloomy
state
of
mind
he
wrote
his
past
and
present
which
appeared
in
and
created
a
storm
of
anger
as
well
as
admiration
it
was
a
sort
of
protest
against
the
political
systems
of
economy
then
so
popular
lockhart
said
of
it
that
he
could
accept
none
of
his
friend
inferences
except
one
that
we
were
all
wrong
and
were
all
like
to
be
damned
gloomy
and
satirical
as
the
book
was
it
made
a
great
impression
on
the
thinkers
of
the
day
while
it
did
not
add
to
the
author
popularity
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
a
prophet
of
wrath
an
ishmaelite
whose
hand
was
against
everybody
he
offended
all
political
parties
the
tories
by
his
radicalism
and
the
radicals
by
his
scorn
of
their
formulas
the
high
churchman
by
his
protestantism
and
the
low
churchman
by
evident
unorthodoxy
yet
all
parties
and
sects
admitted
that
much
that
he
said
was
true
while
at
the
same
time
they
had
no
sympathy
with
his
fierce
ravings
for
ten
years
after
the
publication
of
the
french
revolution
carlyle
assumed
the
functions
of
a
prophet
hurling
anathemas
and
pronouncing
woes
to
his
mind
everything
was
alike
disjointed
or
false
or
pretentious
in
view
of
which
he
uttered
groans
and
hisses
and
maledictions
the
very
name
of
a
society
designed
to
ameliorate
evils
seemed
to
put
him
into
a
passion
every
reformer
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
blind
teacher
of
the
blind
exeter
hall
then
the
scene
of
every
variety
of
social
and
religious
and
political
discussion
was
to
him
a
veritable
pandemonium
everybody
at
that
period
of
agitation
and
reform
was
giving
lectures
and
everybody
went
to
hear
them
and
carlyle
ridiculed
them
all
alike
as
pedlers
of
nostrums
to
heal
diseases
which
were
incurable
he
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
disdain
the
english
people
said
he
number
some
thirty
millions
mostly
fools
his
friends
expostulated
with
him
for
giving
utterance
to
such
bitter
expressions
and
for
holding
such
gloomy
views
john
mill
was
mortally
offended
and
walked
no
more
with
him
de
quincey
said
you
have
made
a
new
hole
in
your
society
kettle
how
do
you
propose
to
mend
it
yet
all
this
while
carlyle
had
not
lost
faith
in
providence
as
it
might
seem
but
felt
that
god
would
inflict
calamities
on
peoples
for
their
sins
he
resembled
savonarola
more
than
he
did
voltaire
what
seemed
to
some
to
be
mockeries
were
really
the
earnest
protests
of
his
soul
against
universal
corruption
to
be
followed
by
downward
courses
and
retribution
his
mind
was
morbid
from
intense
reflection
on
certain
evils
and
from
his
physical
ailments
he
doubtless
grieved
and
alienated
his
best
friends
by
his
diatribes
against
popular
education
and
free
institutions
he
even
appeared
to
lean
to
despotism
and
the
rule
of
tyrants
provided
only
they
were
strong
thus
carlyle
destroyed
his
influence
even
while
he
moved
the
mind
to
reflection
it
was
seen
and
felt
that
he
had
no
sympathy
with
many
movements
designed
to
benefit
society
and
that
he
cherished
utter
scorn
for
many
active
philanthropists
in
his
bitterness
wrath
and
disdain
he
became
himself
intolerant
in
some
of
his
wild
utterances
he
brought
upon
himself
almost
universal
reproach
as
when
he
said
i
never
thought
the
rights
of
negroes
worth
much
discussing
nor
the
rights
of
man
in
any
form
a
sentiment
which
militated
against
his
whole
philosophy
in
this
strange
and
unhappy
mood
of
mind
the
latter
day
pamphlets
past
and
present
and
other
essays
were
written
which
undermined
the
reverence
in
which
he
had
been
held
these
were
the
blots
on
his
great
career
which
may
be
traced
to
sickness
and
a
disordered
mind
in
fact
carlyle
can
not
be
called
a
sound
writer
at
any
period
he
contradicts
himself
he
is
a
great
painter
a
a
satirist
not
a
philosopher
perhaps
the
most
suggestive
writer
of
the
nineteenth
century
often
giving
utterance
to
the
grandest
thoughts
yet
not
a
safe
guide
at
all
times
since
he
is
inconsistent
and
full
of
exaggerations
the
morbid
and
unhealthy
tone
of
carlyle
mind
at
this
period
may
be
seen
by
an
extract
from
one
of
his
letters
to
sterling
i
see
almost
nobody
i
avoid
sight
rather
and
study
to
consume
my
own
smoke
i
wish
you
would
build
me
among
your
buildings
some
small
prophet
chamber
fifteen
feet
square
with
a
flue
for
smoking
sacred
from
all
noises
of
dogs
cocks
and
engaging
some
dumb
old
woman
to
light
a
fire
for
me
daily
and
boil
some
kind
of
a
kettle
thus
quaintly
he
expressed
his
desire
for
uninterrupted
solitude
where
he
could
work
to
advantage
he
was
then
engaged
on
cromwell
and
the
few
persons
with
whom
he
exchanged
letters
show
how
retired
was
his
life
his
friends
were
also
few
although
he
could
have
met
as
many
persons
as
pleased
him
he
was
too
much
absorbed
with
work
to
be
what
is
called
a
society
man
but
what
society
he
did
see
was
of
the
best
at
last
carlyle
task
on
the
life
of
oliver
cromwell
was
finished
in
august
when
he
was
fifty
years
of
age
it
was
the
greatest
contribution
to
english
history
froude
thinks
which
has
been
made
in
the
present
century
carlyle
was
the
first
to
make
cromwell
and
his
age
intelligible
to
mankind
indeed
he
reversed
the
opinions
of
mankind
respecting
that
remarkable
man
which
was
a
great
accomplishment
no
one
doubts
the
genuineness
of
the
portrait
cromwell
was
almost
universally
supposed
fifty
years
ago
to
be
a
hypocrite
as
well
as
a
usurper
in
carlyle
hands
he
stands
out
visionary
perhaps
but
yet
practical
sincere
earnest
a
patriot
devoted
to
the
good
of
his
country
carlyle
rescued
a
great
historical
personage
from
the
accumulated
slanders
of
two
centuries
and
did
his
work
so
well
that
no
hostile
criticisms
have
modified
his
verdict
he
has
painted
a
picture
which
is
immortal
the
insight
the
sagacity
the
ability
and
the
statesmanship
of
cromwell
are
impressed
upon
the
minds
of
all
readers
that
england
never
had
a
greater
or
more
enlightened
ruler
everybody
is
now
forced
to
admit
and
not
merely
a
patriotic
but
a
christian
ruler
who
regarded
himself
simply
as
the
instrument
of
providence
people
still
differ
as
to
the
cause
in
which
cromwell
embarked
and
few
defend
the
means
he
used
to
accomplish
his
ends
he
does
not
stand
out
as
a
perfect
man
he
made
mistakes
and
committed
political
crimes
which
can
be
defended
only
on
grounds
of
expediency
but
his
private
life
was
above
reproach
and
he
died
in
the
triumph
of
christian
faith
after
having
raised
his
country
to
a
higher
pitch
of
glory
than
had
been
seen
since
the
days
of
queen
elizabeth
the
faults
of
the
biographer
centre
in
confounding
right
with
might
and
this
conspicuously
false
doctrine
is
the
leading
defect
of
the
philosophy
of
carlyle
runs
through
all
his
writings
and
makes
him
an
unsound
teacher
if
this
doctrine
be
true
then
all
the
usurpers
of
the
world
from
caesar
to
napoleon
can
be
justified
if
this
be
true
then
an
irresistible
imperialism
becomes
the
best
government
for
mankind
it
is
but
fair
to
say
that
carlyle
himself
denied
this
inference
writing
of
lecky
having
charged
him
with
believing
in
the
divine
right
of
strength
he
says
with
respect
to
that
poor
heresy
of
might
being
the
symbol
of
right
a
certain
great
and
venerable
author
i
shall
have
to
tell
lecky
one
day
that
quite
the
converse
or
is
the
great
and
venerable
author
real
opinion
namely
that
right
is
the
eternal
symbol
of
might
in
fact
he
probably
never
met
with
a
son
of
adam
more
contemptuous
of
might
except
when
it
rests
on
the
above
origin
yet
the
impression
of
all
his
strongest
work
is
the
other
way
certain
other
kindred
doctrines
may
be
inferentially
drawn
from
carlyle
defence
of
cromwell
namely
that
a
popular
assembly
is
incapable
of
guiding
successfully
the
destinies
of
a
nation
that
behind
all
constitutions
lies
an
ultimate
law
of
force
that
majorities
as
such
have
no
more
right
to
rule
than
kings
and
nobles
that
the
strongest
are
the
best
and
the
best
are
the
strongest
that
the
right
to
rule
lies
with
those
who
are
right
in
mind
and
heart
as
he
supposed
cromwell
to
be
and
who
can
execute
their
convictions
such
teachings
it
need
not
be
shown
are
at
war
with
the
whole
progress
of
modern
society
and
the
enlightened
opinion
of
mankind
the
great
merit
of
carlyle
history
is
in
the
clearness
and
vividness
with
which
he
paints
his
hero
and
the
exposure
of
the
injustice
with
which
he
has
been
treated
by
historians
it
is
an
able
vindication
of
cromwell
character
but
the
deductions
drawn
from
his
philosophy
lead
to
absurdity
and
are
an
insult
to
the
understanding
of
the
world
it
was
about
this
time
on
the
conclusion
of
the
cromwell
when
he
was
on
the
summit
of
his
literary
fame
and
the
world
began
to
shower
its
favors
upon
him
that
carlyle
days
were
saddened
by
a
domestic
trouble
which
gave
him
inexpressible
solicitude
and
grief
his
wife
with
whom
he
had
lived
happily
for
so
many
years
was
exceedingly
disturbed
on
account
of
his
intimate
friendship
with
lady
ashburton
nothing
can
be
more
plaintive
and
sadly
beautiful
than
the
letters
he
wrote
to
her
on
the
occasion
of
her
starting
off
in
a
fit
of
spleen
after
a
stormy
scene
to
visit
friends
at
a
distance
and
what
is
singular
is
that
we
do
not
find
in
those
letters
when
his
soul
was
moved
to
its
very
depths
any
of
his
peculiarities
of
style
they
are
remarkably
simple
as
well
as
serious
carlyle
friendship
for
one
of
the
most
brilliant
and
cultivated
women
of
england
which
the
breath
of
scandal
never
for
a
moment
assailed
was
reasonable
and
natural
and
was
a
great
comfort
to
him
he
persisted
in
enjoying
it
knowing
that
his
wife
disliked
it
in
this
matter
which
was
a
cloud
upon
his
married
life
and
saddened
the
family
hearth
for
years
carlyle
was
doubtless
exacting
and
unreasonable
though
some
men
would
have
yielded
the
point
for
the
sake
of
a
faithful
wife
or
even
for
peace
there
are
those
who
think
that
carlyle
was
selfish
in
keeping
up
an
intercourse
which
was
hateful
to
his
wife
but
the
ashburtons
were
the
best
friends
that
carlyle
ever
had
after
he
became
famous
and
in
their
various
country
seats
he
enjoyed
a
hospitality
rarely
extended
to
poor
literary
men
there
he
met
in
enjoyable
and
helpful
intercourse
when
he
could
not
have
seen
them
in
his
own
house
some
of
the
most
distinguished
men
of
the
day
men
of
rank
and
influence
as
well
as
those
of
literary
fame
until
this
intimacy
with
the
ashburtons
no
domestic
disturbances
of
note
had
taken
place
in
the
carlyle
household
the
wife
may
occasionally
have
been
sad
and
lonely
when
her
husband
was
preoccupied
with
his
studies
but
this
she
ought
to
have
anticipated
in
marrying
a
literary
man
whose
only
support
was
from
his
pen
carlyle
too
was
an
inveterate
smoker
and
she
detested
tobacco
so
that
he
did
not
spend
as
much
time
in
the
parlor
as
he
did
in
his
library
where
he
could
smoke
to
his
heart
content
on
the
whole
however
their
letters
show
genuine
mutual
affection
and
as
much
connubial
happiness
as
is
common
to
most
men
and
women
with
far
more
of
intimate
intellectual
and
spiritual
congeniality
carlyle
certainly
in
all
his
letters
ever
speaks
of
his
wife
with
admiration
and
gratitude
he
regarded
her
as
not
only
the
most
talented
woman
that
he
had
ever
known
but
as
the
one
without
whom
he
was
miserable
they
were
the
best
of
comrades
and
companions
from
first
to
last
when
at
home
together
for
a
considerable
period
after
the
publication
of
the
life
of
cromwell
carlyle
was
apparently
idle
he
wrote
for
several
years
nothing
of
note
except
his
latter
day
pamphlets
and
a
life
of
his
friend
john
sterling
to
whom
he
was
tenderly
attached
it
would
seem
that
he
was
now
in
easy
circumstances
although
he
retained
to
the
end
his
economical
habits
he
amused
himself
with
travelling
and
with
frequent
visits
to
distinguished
people
in
the
country
if
not
a
society
man
he
was
much
sought
he
dined
often
at
the
tables
of
the
great
and
personally
knew
almost
every
man
of
note
in
london
he
sturdily
took
his
place
among
distinguished
men
the
intellectual
peer
of
the
greatest
he
often
met
macaulay
but
was
not
intimate
with
him
i
doubt
if
they
even
exchanged
visits
the
reason
for
this
may
have
been
that
they
were
not
congenial
to
each
other
in
anything
and
that
the
social
position
of
macaulay
was
immeasurably
higher
than
carlyle
it
would
be
hard
to
say
which
was
the
greater
man
it
was
not
until
or
when
carlyle
was
that
he
seriously
set
himself
to
write
his
life
of
frederic
his
last
great
work
on
which
he
perseveringly
labored
for
thirteen
years
it
is
an
exhaustive
history
of
the
prussian
hero
and
is
regarded
in
germany
as
the
standard
work
on
that
great
monarch
and
general
the
first
volume
came
out
in
and
the
last
in
it
is
a
marvel
of
industry
and
accuracy
the
most
elaborate
of
all
his
works
but
probably
the
least
read
because
of
its
enormous
length
and
scholastic
pedantries
it
might
be
said
to
bear
the
same
relation
to
his
french
revolution
that
romola
does
to
adam
bede
in
this
book
carlyle
made
no
new
revelations
as
he
did
in
his
life
of
cromwell
he
did
not
change
essentially
the
opinion
of
mankind
frederick
the
great
in
his
hands
still
stands
out
as
an
unscrupulous
public
enemy
a
robber
and
a
tyrant
his
crimes
are
only
partially
redeemed
by
his
heroism
especially
when
europe
was
in
arms
against
him
there
is
the
same
defect
in
this
great
work
that
there
is
in
the
life
of
cromwell
the
inculcation
of
the
doctrine
that
might
makes
right
that
we
may
do
evil
that
good
may
come
thus
putting
expediency
above
eternal
justice
and
palliating
crimes
because
of
their
success
it
is
difficult
to
account
for
carlyle
decline
in
moral
perceptions
when
we
consider
that
his
personal
life
was
so
far
above
reproach
although
the
life
of
frederick
is
a
work
of
transcendent
industry
it
did
not
add
to
carlyle
popularity
which
had
been
undermined
by
his
bitter
attacks
on
society
in
his
various
pamphlets
at
this
period
he
was
still
looked
up
to
with
reverence
as
a
great
intellectual
giant
but
that
love
for
him
which
had
been
felt
by
those
who
were
aroused
to
honest
thinking
by
his
earlier
writings
had
passed
away
a
new
generation
looked
upon
him
as
an
embittered
and
surly
old
man
his
services
were
not
forgotten
but
he
was
no
longer
a
favorite
no
longer
an
inspiring
guide
his
writings
continued
to
stimulate
thought
but
were
no
longer
regarded
as
sound
commonplace
people
never
did
like
him
probably
because
they
never
understood
him
his
admirers
were
among
the
young
the
enthusiastic
the
hopeful
the
inquiring
and
when
their
veneration
passed
away
there
were
few
left
to
uphold
his
real
greatness
and
noble
character
one
might
suppose
that
carlyle
would
have
been
unhappy
to
alienate
so
many
persons
especially
old
admirers
in
fact
i
apprehend
that
he
cared
little
for
anybody
admiration
or
flattery
he
lived
in
an
atmosphere
so
infinitely
above
small
and
envious
and
detracting
people
that
he
was
practically
independent
of
human
sympathies
had
he
been
doomed
to
live
with
commonplace
persons
he
might
have
sought
to
conciliate
them
but
he
really
lived
in
another
sphere
not
perhaps
higher
than
theirs
but
eternally
distinct
in
the
sphere
of
abstract
truth
to
him
most
people
were
either
babblers
or
bores
what
did
he
care
for
their
envious
shafts
or
even
for
their
honest
disapprobation
hence
the
last
days
of
this
great
man
were
not
his
best
days
although
he
was
not
without
honor
he
was
made
lord
rector
of
the
university
of
edinburgh
and
delivered
a
fine
address
on
the
occasion
and
later
disraeli
when
prime
minister
offered
him
knighthood
with
the
grand
cross
of
the
order
of
the
bath
and
a
pension
which
he
declined
the
author
of
the
sartor
resartus
did
not
care
for
titles
he
preferred
to
remain
simply
thomas
carlyle
while
carlyle
was
in
the
midst
of
honors
in
edinburgh
his
wife
who
had
long
been
in
poor
health
suddenly
died
april
this
affliction
was
a
terrible
blow
to
carlyle
from
which
he
never
recovered
it
filled
out
his
measure
of
sorrow
deep
and
sad
and
hard
to
be
borne
his
letters
after
this
are
full
of
pathos
and
plaintive
sadness
he
could
not
get
resigned
to
his
loss
for
his
wife
had
been
more
and
more
his
staff
and
companion
as
years
had
advanced
the
queen
sent
her
sympathy
but
nothing
could
console
him
he
was
then
years
old
and
his
work
was
done
his
remaining
years
were
those
of
loneliness
and
sorrow
and
suffering
he
visited
friends
but
they
amused
him
not
he
wrote
reminiscences
but
his
isolation
remained
he
sought
out
charities
when
he
himself
was
the
object
of
compassion
a
sad
old
man
who
could
not
sleep
he
tried
to
interest
himself
in
politics
but
time
hung
heavy
on
his
hands
he
read
much
and
thought
more
but
assumed
no
fresh
literary
work
he
had
enough
to
do
to
correct
of
new
editions
of
his
works
his
fiercest
protests
were
now
against
atheism
in
its
varied
forms
in
erskine
his
last
scotch
friend
died
in
he
writes
more
and
more
dreary
barren
base
and
ugly
seem
to
me
all
the
aspects
of
this
poor
diminishing
fallen
openly
anarchic
doomed
to
a
death
which
one
can
wish
to
be
speedy
poor
old
man
he
has
survived
his
friends
his
pleasures
his
labors
almost
his
fame
he
is
sick
and
weary
of
life
which
to
him
has
become
a
blank
pity
it
is
he
could
not
have
died
when
cromwell
was
completed
he
drags
on
his
forlorn
life
without
wife
or
children
and
with
only
a
few
friends
in
disease
and
ennui
and
discontent
almost
alone
until
he
is
and
and
creeps
on
this
petty
pace
from
day
to
day
to
the
last
syllable
of
recorded
time
and
all
our
yesterdays
have
lighted
fools
the
way
to
dusty
death
out
out
brief
candle
life
but
a
walking
shadow
a
poor
player
that
struts
and
frets
his
hour
upon
the
stage
and
then
is
heard
no
more
it
is
a
tale
told
by
an
idiot
full
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
the
relief
came
at
last
it
was
on
a
cold
day
in
february
that
lecky
froude
and
tyndall
alone
of
his
london
friends
accompanied
his
mortal
remains
to
ecclefechan
where
he
was
buried
by
the
graves
of
his
father
and
mother
he
might
have
rested
in
the
vaults
of
westminster
but
he
chose
to
lie
in
a
humble
churchyard
near
where
he
was
born
in
future
years
says
his
able
and
interesting
biographer
scotland
will
have
raised
a
monument
over
his
remains
but
no
monument
is
needed
for
one
who
has
made
an
eternal
memorial
for
himself
in
the
hearts
of
all
to
whom
truth
is
the
dearest
possession
giving
his
soul
to
the
common
cause
he
won
for
himself
a
wreath
which
will
not
fade
and
a
tomb
the
most
honorable
not
where
his
dust
is
decaying
but
where
his
glory
lives
in
everlasting
remembrance
for
of
illustrious
men
all
the
earth
is
the
sepulchre
and
it
is
not
the
inscribed
column
in
their
own
land
which
is
the
record
of
their
virtues
but
the
unwritten
memories
of
them
in
the
hearts
and
minds
of
all
mankind

thomas
carlyle
will
always
have
an
honorable
place
among
the
great
men
of
his
time
he
was
a
profound
thinker
a
severe
critic
a
great
a
man
of
uncommon
original
gifts
who
aroused
and
instructed
his
generation
in
the
literal
sense
he
was
neither
philosopher
nor
poet
nor
statesman
but
a
man
of
genius
who
cast
his
searching
and
fearless
glance
into
all
creeds
systems
and
public
movements
denouncing
hypocrisies
shams
and
lies
with
such
power
that
he
lost
friends
almost
as
fast
as
he
made
them
without
however
losing
the
respect
and
admiration
of
his
literary
rivals
or
of
the
ablest
and
best
men
both
in
england
and
america
although
no
believer
in
the
scientific
philosophies
of
our
time
he
was
a
great
breaker
of
ground
for
them
having
been
a
pioneer
in
the
cause
of
honest
thinking
and
plain
speaking
his
passion
for
truth
and
courage
in
declaring
his
own
vision
of
it
were
potent
for
spiritual
liberty
he
stands
as
one
of
the
earliest
and
stoutest
champions
of
that
revolt
against
authority
in
religious
intellectual
and
social
matters

has
chiefly
marked
the
nineteenth
century

macaulay

among
the
eminent
men
of
letters
of
the
present
century
thomas
babington
macaulay
takes
a
very
high
position
in
original
genius
he
was
inferior
to
carlyle
but
was
greater
in
learning
in
judgment
and
especially
in
felicity
of
style
he
was
an
historical
artist
of
the
foremost
rank
the
like
of
whom
has
not
appeared
since
voltaire
and
he
was
moreover
no
mean
poet
and
might
have
been
distinguished
as
such
had
poetry
been
his
highest
pleasure
and
ambition
the
same
may
be
said
of
him
as
a
political
orator
very
few
men
in
the
house
of
commons
ever
surpassed
him
in
the
power
of
making
an
eloquent
speech
he
was
too
impetuous
and
dogmatic
to
be
a
great
debater
like
fox
or
pitt
or
peel
or
gladstone
but
he
might
have
reached
a
more
exalted
and
influential
position
as
a
statesman
had
he
confined
his
remarkable
talents
to
politics
but
letters
were
the
passion
of
macaulay
from
his
youth
up
and
his
remarkably
tenacious
memory
abnormal
as
it
seems
to
me
enabled
him
to
bring
his
vast
store
of
facts
to
support
plausibly
any
position
he
chose
to
take
at
fifty
years
of
age
he
had
probably
read
more
books
than
any
man
in
europe
since
gibbon
and
niebuhr
he
literally
devoured
everything
he
could
put
his
hands
upon
without
cramming
for
a
special
object
especially
the
greek
and
latin
classics
which
he
read
over
and
over
again
not
so
much
for
knowledge
as
for
the
pleasure
it
gave
him
as
a
literary
critic
and
a
student
of
artistic
excellence
macaulay
was
of
scotch
descent
like
so
many
eminent
historians
poets
critics
and
statesmen

and

macaulay
belonged
to
a
good
family
the
most
distinguished
members
of
which
were
clergymen
with
the
exception
of
his
uncle
general
macaulay
who
made

and

merchant
and

more
than

excepted
to
do

zachary
macaulay
was
the
most
modest
and
religious
of
men
and
after
an
eventful
life
in
africa
as
governor
of
the
colony
of
sierra
leone
settled
in
clapham
near
london
with
a
handsome
fortune
he
belonged
to
that
famous
evangelical
set
who
made
clapham
famous
and
whose
extraordinary
piety
and
philanthropy
are
commemorated
by
sir
james
stephen
in
one
of
his
most
interesting
essays
they
resembled
in
peculiarities
the
early
quakers
and
primitive
methodists
and
though
very
narrow
were
much
respected
for
their
unostentatious
benevolence
blended
with
public
spirit
macaulay
was
born
at
rothley
temple
in
leicestershire
but
it
was
at
clapham
that
his
boyhood
was
chiefly
spent
his
precocity
startled
every
one
who
visited
his
father
hospitable
home
at
the
age
of
three
he
would
lie
at
full
length
on
the
carpet
eagerly
reading
he
was
never
seen
without
an
open
book
in
his
hands
even
during
his
walks
he
cared
nothing
for
the
sports
of
his
companions
he
could
neither
ride
nor
drive
nor
swim
nor
row
a
boat
nor
play
a
game
of
tennis
or
he
cared
only
for
books
of
all
sorts
which
he
seized
upon
with
inextinguishable
curiosity
and
stored
their
contents
in
his
memory
when
a
boy
he
had
learned
the
paradise
lost
by
heart
he
did
not
care
to
go
to
school
because
it
interrupted
his
reading
hannah
more
a
frequent
visitor
at
clapham
and
a
warm
friend
of
the
family
gazed
upon
him
with
amazement
but
was
too
wise
and
conscientious
to
spoil
him
by
her
commendations
at
eight
years
of
age
he
also
had
great
facility
in
making
verses
which
were
more
than
tolerable
zachary
macaulay
objected
to
his
son
being
educated
in
one
of
the
great
schools
in
england
like
westminster
and
harrow
and
he
was
therefore
sent
to
a
private
school
kept
by
an
evangelical
divine
who
had
been
a
fellow
at
cambridge
a
good
scholar
but
narrow
in
his
theological
views
indeed
macaulay
got
enough
of
calvinism
before
he
went
to
college
and
was
so
unwisely
crammed
with
it
at
home
and
at
school
that
through
life
he
had
a
repugnance
to
the
evangelical
doctrines
of
the
low
church
with
which
much
to
the
grief
of
his
father
he
associated
cant
always
his
especial
abhorrence
and
disgust
while
macaulay
venerated
his
father
he
had
little
sympathy
with
his
views
and
never
loved
him
as
he
did
his
own
sisters
he
did
his
filial
duty
and
that
was
all
contributed
largely
to
his
father
support
in
later
life
treated
him
with
profound
respect
but
was
never
drawn
to
him
in
affectionate
frankness
and
confidence
it
can
not
be
disguised
that
macaulay
was
worldly
in
his
turn
of
mind
intensely
practical
and
ambitious
of
distinction
as
soon
as
he
became
conscious
of
his
great
powers
although
in
his
he
was
very
modest
and
retiring
he
was
not
religiously
inclined
nor
at
all
spiritually
minded
an
omnivorous
reader
seldom
is
narrow
and
seldom
is
profound
macaulay
was
no
exception
he
admired
pascal
but
only
for
his
exquisite
style
and
his
trenchant
irony
he
saw
little
in
augustine
except
his
vast
acquaintance
with
latin
authors
he
carefully
avoided
writing
on
the
schoolmen
or
calvin
or
the
great
divines
of
the
seventeenth
century
bunyan
he
admired
for
his
genius
and
perspicuous
style
rather
than
for
his
sentiments
even
his
famous
article
on
bacon
is
deficient
in
spiritual
insight
it
is
a
description
of
the
man
rather
than
a
dissertation
on
his
philosophy
macaulay
greatness
was
intellectual
rather
than
moral
and
his
mental
power
was
that
of
the
scholar
and
the
rhetorical
artist
rather
than
the
thinker
in
his
masterly
way
of
arraying
facts
he
has
never
been
surpassed
and
in
this
he
was
so
skilful
that
it
mattered
little
which
side
he
took
like
daniel
webster
he
could
make
any
side
appear
plausible
doubtless
in
the
law
he
might
have
become
a
great
advocate
had
he
not
preferred
literary
composition
instead
had
he
lived
in
the
times
of
the
grecian
sophists
he
might
have
baffled
socrates
not
by
his
logic
but
by
his
learning
and
his
aptness
of
illustration
macaulay
entered
trinity
college
cambridge
in
being
a
healthy
robust
young
man
of
eighteen
after
five
years
training
in
greek
and
latin
having
the
eldest
son
of
wilberforce
for
a
school
companion
among
his
contemporaries
and
friends
at
cambridge
were
charles
austin
praed
derwent
coleridge
hyde
villiers
and
romilly
but
i
infer
from
his
life
by
trevelyan
that
his
circle
of
intimate
friends
was
not
so
large
as
it
would
have
been
had
he
been
fitted
for
college
at
westminster
or
eton
nor
at
this
time
were
his
pecuniary
circumstances
encouraging
after
he
had
obtained
his
first
degree
he
supported
himself
while
studying
for
a
fellowship
by
taking
a
couple
of
pupils
for
a
year
eventually
he
gained
a
fellowship
worth
a
year
which
was
his
main
support
for
seven
years
until
he
obtained
a
government
office
in
london
he
probably
would
have
found
it
easier
to
get
a
fellowship
at
oxford
than
at
cambridge
since
mathematics
were
uncongenial
to
him
his
forte
being
languages
he
was
most
distinguished
at
college
for
english
composition
and
latin
declamation
in
he
wrote
a
poem
pompeii
which
gained
him
the
chancellor
medal
a
distinction
won
again
in
by
a
poem
on
evening
while
the
same
year
gave
him
the
craven
scholarship
for
his
classical
attainments
he
took
his
bachelor
degree
in
and
was
made
a
fellow
of
trinity
college
he
did
not
obtain
his
fellowship
however
until
his
third
trial
being
no
favorite
with
those
who
had
prizes
and
honors
to
bestow
because
of
his
neglect
of
science
and
mathematics
as
a
profession
macaulay
made
choice
of
the
law
being
called
to
the
bar
in
and
at
leeds
joined
the
northern
circuit
of
which
brougham
was
the
leading
star
but
the
law
was
not
his
delight
he
did
not
like
its
technicalities
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
his
chambers
in
literary
composition
or
in
the
galleries
of
the
house
of
commons
listening
to
the
debates
he
never
applied
himself
seriously
to
anything
which
went
against
the
grain
at
court
he
got
no
briefs
but
his
fellowship
enabled
him
to
live
by
practising
economy
he
also
wrote
occasional
essays
excellent
but
not
remarkable
for
knight
quarterly
magazine
it
was
in
this
periodical
too
that
his
early
poems
were
published
but
he
did
not
devote
much
time
to
this
field
of
letters
although
as
we
have
said
he
might
undoubtedly
have
succeeded
in
it
his
poetry
if
he
had
never
written
anything
else
would
not
be
considered
much
inferior
to
that
of
sir
walter
scott
being
full
of
life
and
action
and
like
most
everything
else
he
did
winning
him
applause
years
later
he
felt
the
risk
of
publishing
his
lays
of
ancient
rome
but
as
he
knew
what
he
could
do
and
what
he
could
not
do
or
rather
what
would
be
popular
he
was
not
disappointed
the
poems
were
well
received
for
they
were
eminently
picturesque
and
vital
as
well
as
strong
masculine
and
unadorned
the
rhyme
and
metre
were
also
felicitous
he
had
no
obscurities
and
the
spirit
of
his
lays
was
patriotic
and
ardent
showing
his
love
of
liberty
i
think
his
battle
of
ivry
is
equal
to
anything
that
scott
wrote
yet
macaulay
is
not
regarded
by
the
critics
as
a
true
poet
that
is
he
did
not
write
poetry
because
he
must
like
burns
and
byron
his
poetry
was
not
spontaneous
it
was
a
manufactured
article
very
good
of
its
kind
but
not
such
as
to
have
given
him
the
fame
which
his
prose
writings
made
for
him
it
was
not
however
until
his
article
on
milton
appeared
in
the
edinburgh
review
in
that
macaulay
great
career
began
like
byron
he
woke
up
one
morning
to
find
himself
famous
everybody
read
and
admired
an
essay
the
style
of
which
was
new
and
striking
where
did
you
pick
up
that
style
wrote
jeffrey
to
the
briefless
barrister
it
transcended
in
brilliancy
anything
which
had
yet
appeared
in
the
edinburgh
or
quarterly
brougham
became
envious
and
treated
the
rising
light
with
no
magnanimity
or
admiration
of
course
the
author
of
such
an
uncommon
article
as
that
on
milton
the
praise
of
which
was
in
everybody
mouth
had
invitations
to
dinner
from
distinguished
people
and
these
were
most
eagerly
accepted
macaulay
rapidly
became
a
social
favorite
sought
for
his
brilliant
conversation
which
was
as
remarkable
for
a
young
man
of
as
were
his
writings
in
the
foremost
literary
journal
of
the
world
he
was
not
handsome
and
was
carelessly
dressed
but
he
had
a
massive
head
and
rugged
yet
benevolent
features
which
lighted
up
with
peculiar
animation
when
he
was
excited
one
of
the
first
persons
of
note
to
welcome
him
to
her
table
was
lady
holland
an
accomplished
but
eccentric
and
woman
who
seems
to
have
greatly
admired
him
he
was
a
frequent
guest
at
holland
house
where
for
nearly
the
courtly
and
distinguished
lord
holland
and
his
wife
entertained
the
most
eminent
men
and
women
of
the
time
this
gratified
young
inordinate
social
ambition
he
scarcely
mentions
in
his
letters
at
this
time
any
but
peers
and
peeresses
and
yet
he
did
not
court
the
society
of
those
he
did
not
respect
he
was
not
a
parasite
or
a
flatterer
even
of
the
great
but
met
them
apparently
on
equal
terms
as
a
monarch
of
the
mind
he
was
at
home
in
any
circle
that
was
not
ignorant
or
frivolous
he
was
more
easy
than
genial
for
his
prejudices
or
intellectual
pride
made
him
unkind
to
persons
of
mediocrity
it
was
a
bold
thing
to
cross
his
path
for
he
came
down
like
an
avalanche
on
those
who
opposed
him
not
so
much
in
anger
as
in
contempt
i
do
not
find
that
his
circle
of
literary
friends
was
large
or
intimate
he
seldom
alludes
to
carlyle
or
bulwer
or
thackeray
or
dickens
he
has
more
to
say
of
rogers
and
lord
jeffrey
and
other
pets
of
aristocratic
circles
those
who
were
conventionally
favored
like
sydney
smith
or
those
who
gave
banquets
to
people
of
fashion
like
lord
lansdowne
these
were
the
people
he
loved
best
to
associate
with
who
listened
to
his
rhetoric
with
rapt
admiration
who
did
not
pique
his
vanity
and
who
had
something
to
give
to
him
position
and
macaulay
was
not
a
vain
man
nor
even
egotistical
but
he
had
a
tremendous
which
annoyed
his
equals
in
literary
fame
and
repelled
such
a
giant
as
brougham
who
had
no
idea
of
sharing
his
throne
with
any
one
being
more
overbearing
even
than
macaulay
but
more
human
this
new
rival
in
the
edinburgh
review
of
which
for
a
long
time
brougham
had
been
dictator
was
much
to
jeffrey
annoyance
not
convivial
he
did
not
drink
two
bottles
at
a
sitting
but
guarded
his
health
and
preserved
his
simple
habits
though
he
speaks
with
gusto
of
lord
holland
turtle
and
turbot
and
venison
and
grouse
he
was
content
when
alone
with
a
and
a
few
glasses
of
sherry
or
the
october
ale
of
cambridge
which
was
a
part
of
his
perquisites
as
fellow
he
was
very
exclusive
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
poor
man
without
aristocratic
antecedents
or
many
powerful
friends
outside
the
class
of
rank
and
fashion
his
friends
seem
to
have
been
leading
politicians
of
the
liberal
school
the
stanch
whigs
who
passed
the
reform
bill
to
whom
he
was
true
to
his
credit
his
happiest
hours
were
spent
with
his
sisters
in
the
quiet
seclusion
of
his
father
modest
home
all
his
best
letters
were
to
them
and
in
these
he
detailed
his
intercourse
with
the
great
and
the
splendor
of
their
banquets
and
balls
macaulay
rise
after
he
had
written
his
famous
article
on
milton
was
rapid
the
article
itself
striking
as
it
is
must
be
confessed
to
be
disappointing
in
so
far
as
it
attempted
to
criticise
the
paradise
lost
and
milton
other
poems
macaulay
genius
was
historical
not
critical
and
the
essay
is
notable
rather
for
its
review
of
the
times
of
charles
and
archbishop
laud
of
the
puritans
and
the
royalists
than
for
its
literary
flavor
except
as
a
brilliant
piece
of
composition
it
was
however
the
picturesque
style
of
the
new
writer
which
was
the
chief
attraction
and
the
fact
that
the
essay
came
from
so
young
a
man
macaulay
followed
the
milton
essay
with
others
on
macchiavelli
dryden
hallam
constitutional
history
and
on
history
in
general
which
displayed
to
great
advantage
his
unusual
learning
his
keen
historic
instinct
and
his
splendor
of
style
he
became
the
most
popular
contributor
to
the
edinburgh
review
which
was
beginning
to
be
dull
and
heavy
and
this
kept
him
before
the
eyes
of
politicians
and
professional
men
macaulay
ambition
was
now
divided
between
literature
and
politics
his
first
appearance
as
a
public
speaker
was
at
an
annual
convention
in
london
in
when
he
made
a
marked
impression
he
eagerly
embraced
the
offer
of
a
seat
in
the
house
of
commons
which
was
secured
to
him
in
and
as
soon
as
he
entered
parliament
he
began
to
make
speeches
which
were
carefully
composed
and
probably
committed
to
memory
at
a
single
bound
he
became
one
of
the
leading
orators
of
that
renowned
assembly
some
of
his
orations
were
masterpieces
of
argument
and
rhetoric
in
favor
of
reform
and
of
all
liberal
movements
in
philanthropy
and
education
in
the
opinion
of
eminent
statesmen
he
was
the
most
rising
member
of
the
house
and
sure
to
become
a
leader
among
the
whigs
but
he
was
poor
having
only
about
a
year
the
proceeds
of
his
fellowship
and
his
literary
productions
to
support
his
dignity
as
a
legislator
and
meet
the
calls
of
society
so
that
in
he
was
rewarded
with
an
office
in
the
board
of
control
which
regulated
the
affairs
of
india
this
doubled
his
income
and
made
him
independent
but
he
wanted
an
office
in
which
he
could
lay
up
money
for
future
contingencies
therefore
in
he
gladly
resigned
his
seat
in
parliament
and
accepted
the
situation
of
a
member
of
the
supreme
council
of
india
on
a
salary
of
a
year
of
which
he
continued
to
save
yearly
so
that
at
the
end
of
four
years
when
he
returned
to
england
he
had
become
a
rich
man
or
at
least
independent
with
leisure
to
do
whatever
he
pleased
in
india
as
chairman
of
the
board
of
education
as
legal
adviser
of
the
council
and
in
drafting
a
code
of
penal
laws
for
that
part
of
the
empire
he
was
very
useful
although
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
new
code
was
too
theoretically
fine
to
be
practical
and
was
never
put
in
force
his
personal
good
sense
was
equal
to
his
industry
and
his
talents
and
he
preserved
his
health
by
strict
habits
of
temperance
even
in
that
tropical
country
he
presented
a
strong
contrast
to
the
sallow
bilious
officials
with
whom
he
was
surrounded
and
in
due
time
returned
to
england
in
perfect
health
one
of
the
most
robust
of
men
capable
of
indefinite
work
which
never
seemed
to
weary
him
but
in
calcutta
as
in
london
he
employed
his
leisure
hours
in
writing
for
the
edinburgh
review
and
gave
an
immense
impulse
to
its
sale
for
which
he
was
amply
rewarded
brougham
complained
to
jeffrey
that
his
essays
took
up
too
much
space
in
the
review
but
the
politic
editor
knew
what
was
for
its
interest
and
popularity
macaulay
long
articles
of
sometimes
over
a
hundred
pages
were
received
without
a
murmur
and
every
article
he
wrote
added
to
his
fame
since
he
always
did
his
best
his
essays
in
on
southey
and
montgomery
and
one
in
on
edition
of
boswell
life
of
johnson
were
fierce
scathing
onslaughts
even
cruel
and
crushing
revealing
macaulay
tremendous
powers
of
invective
and
remorseless
criticism
but
reflecting
little
credit
on
his
disposition
or
his
judgment
his
hampden
and
his
burleigh
remain
among
his
finest
and
most
inspiring
historical
paintings
his
first
essay
on
lord
chatham
is
a
notable
piece
of
characterization
the
one
on
sir
james
mackintosh
is
a
most
acute
and
brilliant
historical
criticism
the
one
on
lord
bacon
is
striking
and
has
become
famous
but
shows
macaulay
deficiency
in
philosophic
thought
besides
being
sophistical
in
spirit
and
the
article
on
sir
william
temple
really
a
history
of
england
during
the
reign
of
william
is
thoroughly
fine
macaulay
residence
in
india
so
far
as
political
ambition
was
concerned
may
have
been
a
mistake
it
withdrew
him
from
an
arena
in
which
he
could
have
risen
to
great
distinction
and
influence
as
a
parliamentary
orator
he
might
have
been
a
second
fox
whom
he
resembled
in
the
impetuosity
of
his
rhetoric
if
he
had
also
possessed
talents
as
a
debater
yet
he
was
not
a
born
leader
of
men
as
a
parliamentary
orator
he
was
simply
a
like
the
unitarian
minister
fox
or
that
still
abler
man
the
quaker
bright
both
of
whom
were
great
rhetoricians
it
is
probable
that
he
himself
understood
his
true
sphere
which
was
that
of
a
literary
man
an
historical
critic
appealing
to
intelligent
people
rather
than
to
learned
pedants
in
the
universities
his
service
in
india
enabled
him
to
write
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
with
an
untrammelled
pen
and
to
live
in
comfort
and
ease
enjoying
the
cum
to
which
he
attached
supreme
importance
so
different
from
carlyle
who
toiled
in
poverty
at
chelsea
to
declare
truth
for
truth
sake
grumbling
yet
lofty
in
his
meditations
the
depth
of
which
macaulay
was
incapable
of
appreciating
it
is
then
as
a
man
of
letters
rather
than
as
a
politician
that
our
author
merits
his
exalted
fame
respectable
as
a
member
of
the
house
of
commons
or
as
a
jurist
in
india
in
compiling
a
code
of
laws
yet
neither
as
a
statesman
nor
as
a
jurist
was
he
in
his
right
place
the
leaders
of
his
party
may
have
admired
and
praised
his
oratory
but
they
wanted
something
more
practical
than
orations
they
wanted
the
control
of
men
and
so
too
the
government
demanded
a
code
which
would
exact
the
esteem
of
lawyers
and
meet
the
wants
of
india
rather
than
a
composition
which
would
read
well
but
as
an
historical
critic
and
a
luminous
writer
macaulay
had
no
superior
a
fact
which
no
one
knew
better
than
himself
in
on
his
return
from
india
where
he
had
regarded
himself
as
in
honorable
exile
macaulay
had
accumulated
a
fortune
of
to
him
more
than
a
competency
this
added
to
the
legacy
of
which
he
had
received
from
his
uncle
general
macaulay
secured
to
him
independence
and
leisure
to
pursue
his
literary
work
which
was
paramount
to
every
other
consideration
if
both
from
pleasure
and
ambition
there
ever
was
a
man
devoted
heart
and
soul
and
body
to
a
literary
career
it
was
macaulay
nor
would
he
now
accept
any
political
office
which
seriously
interfered
with
the
passion
of
his
life
still
less
would
he
waste
his
time
at
the
dinner
parties
of
the
great
no
longer
to
him
a
novelty
he
was
eminently
social
by
nature
and
fond
of
talk
and
controversy
with
a
superb
physique
capable
of
digesting
the
richest
dishes
and
of
enduring
the
fatigues
and
ceremonies
of
fashionable
life
but
even
the
pleasures
of
the
banquet
and
of
cultivated
society
to
many
a
mere
relaxation
were
sacrificed
to
his
fondness
for
books
to
him
the
greatest
and
truest
companionship
especially
when
they
introduced
him
to
the
life
and
manners
of
ages
and
to
communion
with
the
of
the
world
for
relaxation
macaulay
preferred
to
take
long
walks
lounge
around
the
visit
the
sights
of
london
with
his
nieces
invite
his
intimate
friends
to
simple
dinners
at
the
albany
amuse
himself
with
trifles
especially
in
company
with
those
he
loved
best
in
the
domestic
circle
of
his
relatives
whom
he
treated
ever
with
the
most
familiar
and
affectionate
sympathy
so
that
while
they
loved
and
revered
him
they
had
no
idea
that
uncle
tom
was
a
great
man
his
most
interesting
letters
were
to
his
sisters
and
nieces
whose
amusement
and
welfare
he
had
constantly
in
view
and
who
were
more
to
him
than
all
the
world
besides
indeed
he
did
not
write
many
letters
except
to
his
relatives
his
publishers
and
his
intimate
friends
who
were
few
considering
the
number
of
persons
he
was
obliged
to
meet
he
was
a
thoroughly
domestic
man
although
he
never
married
or
wished
to
marry
it
surprises
me
that
macaulay
intercourse
with
eminent
authors
was
so
constrained
he
saw
very
little
of
them
but
while
he
did
not
avoid
talking
with
them
when
thrown
among
them
and
keeping
up
the
courtesies
of
life
even
with
those
he
thoroughly
disliked
i
can
not
see
any
evidence
that
he
sought
the
society
of
those
who
were
regarded
as
his
equals
in
genius
he
liked
milman
and
mackintosh
and
napier
and
jeffrey
and
rogers
and
a
few
others
but
his
intimate
intercourse
was
confined
chiefly
to
these
and
to
his
family
macaulay
fame
however
was
substantially
founded
and
built
sydney
smith
witty
characterization
of
him
is
worth
recalling
i
always
prophesied
his
greatness
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
him
then
a
very
young
and
unknown
man
on
the
northern
circuit
there
are
no
limits
to
his
knowledge
on
small
subjects
as
well
as
great
he
is
like
a
book
in
breeches
yes
i
agree
he
is
certainly
more
agreeable
since
his
return
from
india
his
enemies
might
have
said
before
though
never
did
so
that
he
talked
rather
too
much
but
now
he
has
occasional
flashes
of
silence
that
make
his
conversation
perfectly
delightful
but
what
is
far
better
and
more
important
than
all
this
is
that
i
believe
macaulay
to
be
incorruptible
you
might
lay
ribbons
stars
garters
wealth
title
before
him
in
vain
he
has
an
honest
genuine
love
of
his
country
and
the
world
could
not
bribe
him
to
neglect
her
interests
macaulay
now
devoted
several
weeks
of
every
year
to
travel
visiting
different
parts
of
england
and
the
continent
as
the
mood
took
him
in
the
autumn
of
he
visited
italy
it
would
seem
for
the
first
time
and
was
of
course
enchanted
he
appreciated
natural
scenery
but
was
not
enthusiastic
over
it
nor
did
it
make
a
very
deep
impression
on
him
except
for
the
moment
he
loved
best
to
visit
cities
and
places
consecrated
by
classical
associations
while
at
rome
macaulay
received
from
lord
melbourne
the
offer
of
the
office
of
judge
advocate
but
he
unhesitatingly
declined
it
the
salary
of
was
nothing
to
a
scholar
who
already
had
a
comfortable
independence
and
the
duties
the
situation
imposed
were
not
only
uncongenial
but
would
interfere
with
his
literary
labors
in
february
he
returned
to
london
and
now
the
pressure
on
him
by
his
political
friends
to
public
life
was
greater
than
he
could
resist
he
was
elected
to
parliament
as
one
of
the
members
from
edinburgh
and
gave
his
usual
support
to
his
party
in
september
he
became
war
secretary
with
a
seat
in
the
whig
cabinet
under
lord
melbourne
consequently
he
suspended

conducting
the
business
of
his
department
with
commendable
industry
but
without
enthusiasm
in
the
session
of
and
during
the
angry
discussions
pertaining
to
the
registration
of
votes
in
ireland
he
gave
proof
of
having
profited
by
the
severe
legal
training
he
had
received
from
his
labors
in
india
during
these
years
he
found
time
to
write
a
few
reviews
the
one
on
lord
olive
being
the
most
prominent
the
great
subject
of
political
agitation
at
this
period
was
the
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
the
whig
leaders
had
lost
the
earnestness
which
had
marked
their
grand
efforts
when
they
carried
the
reform
bill
of
and
were
more
indifferent
to
further
reforms
than
suited
their
constituents
so
that
at
a
dangerous
financial
crisis
in
the
direction
of
public
affairs
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
tories
under
sir
robert
peel
this
great
man
not
only
rescued
the
nation
from
its
fiscal
embarrassments
but
having
been
convinced
by
the
arguments
of
cobden
of
the
necessity
of
repealing
the
corn
laws
he
carried
through
that
great
reform
to
the
disgust
of
his
party
and
to
his
own
undying
fame

macaulay
was
not
much
moved
by
the
fall
of
the
ministry
to
which
he
belonged
and
gladly
resumed
his
literary
labors
the
first
fruits
of
his
leisure
being
an
essay
on
warren
hastings
a
companion
piece
to
the
one
on
clive
these
east
indian
essays
constitute
the
most
picturesque
and
graphic
account
of
british
conquests
in
that
ancient
land
that
has
been
given
to
the
public
macaulay
intimate
knowledge
of
the
ground
and
his
literary
resources
enabled
him
to
picture
the
dazzling
successes
of
clive
and
hastings
so
that
the
careers
of
those
superb
military
chieftains
and
commercial
in
securing
for
their
country
the
control
of
a
distant
province
larger
than
france
and
in
enriching
the
british
empire
and
themselves
beyond
all
precedent
in
conquest
stand
splendidly
portrayed
forever
macaulay
had
now
taken
apartments
in
the
albany
on
the
second
floor
to
which
he
removed
his
large
library
and
in
which
he
comfortably
lived
for
fifteen
years
his
article
on
warren
hastings
was
followed
by
that
on
frederic
the
great
his
numerous
articles
in
the
edinburgh
review
had
now
become
so
popular
that
there
was
a
great
demand
for
them
in
a
separate
form
curiously
enough
as
in
the
case
of
carlyle
it
was
in
america
that
the
public
appreciation
of
these
essays
first
took
the
form
of
book
publication
and
macaulay
miscellanies
were
published
in
boston
in
and
in
philadelphia
in
as
these
volumes
began
to
go
to
england
for
macaulay
own
protection
they
were
republished
by
longman
revised
by
the
author
in
and
obtained
an
immediate
and
immense
sale
reaching
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
copies
in
england
which
added
to
the
fame
and
income
of
macaulay
but
he
was
never
satisfied
with
the
finish
of
his
own
productions
the
only
thing
which
seemed
to
comfort
him
was
that
the
last
essays
were
better
than
the
first
in
addition
to
his
labors
for
the
edinburgh
was
the
publication
of
a
volume
of
his
poems
in
which
was
also
enthusiastically
received
by
his
admirers
his
last
notable
essays
were
a
chivalrous
article
on
madame
january
an
entirely
charming
account
of
addison
and
the
wits
of
queen
anne
reign
july
an
interesting
review
of
the
memoirs
of
barère
the
french
revolutionist
and
writer
april
and
finally
a
second
article
on
lord
chatham
october
which
is
considered
finer
than
the
first
one
written
twenty
years
earlier
more
and
more
however
the
project
of
writing
a
history
of
england
had
taken
possession
of
him
and
he
began
now
to
forego
all
other
literary
occupation
and
to
devote
all
his
leisure
time
to
that
great
work
during
much
of
the
time
that
macaulay
had
continued
writing
his
reviews
at
the
rate
of
about
two
in
a
year
he
was
an
active
member
of
parliament
frequently
addressing
the
house
of
commons
and
earning
the
gratitude
of
the
country
by
his
liberal
and
enlightened
views
especially
those
in
reference
to
the
right
of
unitarians
to
their
chapels
to
the
enlarged
given
to
the
irish
roman
catholic
maynooth
college
and
to
the
extension
of
copyrights
he
rarely
spoke
without
careful
preparation
his
speeches
were
forcible
and
fine
in
the
higher
field
of
debate
however
as
we
have
already
intimated
he
was
not
successful
in
sir
robert
peel
retired
the
whigs
again
coming
into
power
and
in
macaulay
accepted
the
office
of
paymaster
of
the
forces
because
its
duties
were
comparatively
light
and
would
not
much
interfere
with
his
literary
labors
while
it
added
a
year
to
his
income
during
the
session
of
and
while
still
in
parliament
he
spoke
only
five
times
although
the
house
was
ever
ready
to
listen
to
him
in
the
year
the
disruption
of
the
scotch
church
was
effected
and
in
the
bitterness
engendered
by
that
movement
macaulay
lost
his
popularity
with
his
edinburgh
constituents
he
seemed
indifferent
to
their
affairs
he
answered
their
letters
irregularly
and
with
almost
contemptuous
brevity
he
had
no
sympathy
with
the
radicals
who
at
that
time
controlled
a
large
number
of
votes
and
he
refused
to
contribute
towards
electioneering
expenses
above
all
he
was
absorbed
in
his
history
and
had
lost
much
of
his
interest
in
politics
in
consequence
he
failed
to
be
and
not
unwillingly
retired
to
private
life
macaulay
now
concentrated
all
his
energies
on
the
history
which
occupied
his
thoughts
his
studies
and
his
pen
for
the
most
part
during
the
remainder
of
his
life
the
first
two
volumes
were
published
in
the
latter
part
of
and
the
sale
was
immense
surpassing
that
of
any
historical
work
in
the
history
of
literature
and
coming
near
to
the
sale
of
the
novels
of
sir
walter
scott
the
popularity
of
the
work
was
not
confined
to
scholars
and
statesmen
and
critics
but
it
was
equally
admired
by
ordinary
readers
and
not
in
england
and
scotland
alone
but
in
the
united
states
in
france
in
holland
in
germany
and
other
countries
the
labor
expended
on
these
books
was
prodigious
the
author
visited
in
person
nearly
all
the
localities
in
england
and
ireland
where
the
events
he
narrated
took
place
he
ransacked
the
archives
of
most
of
the
governments
of
europe
and
all
the
libraries
to
which
he
could
gain
access
public
and
private
he
worked
twelve
hours
a
day
and
yet
produced
on
an
average
only
two
printed
pages
daily
so
careful
was
he
in
verifying
his
facts
and
in
arranging
his
materials
writing
and
rewriting
until
no
further
improvement
could
be
made
this
book
was
not
merely
the
result
of
his
researches
for
the
last
fifteen
years
of
his
life
but
of
his
general
reading
for
nearly
fifty
years
when
everything
he
read
he
remembered
says
thackeray
he
reads
twenty
books
to
write
a
sentence
he
travels
one
hundred
miles
to
make
a
line
of
description
the
extent
and
exactness
of
his
knowledge
were
not
only
marvellous
but
almost
incredible
buckle
declared
that
macaulay
was
perfectly
accurate
in
all
the
facts
which
buckle
had
himself
investigated
to
write
his
history
of
civilization
and
so
particular
was
he
in
the
selection
of
words
that
he
never
allowed
a
sentence
to
pass
muster
until
it
was
as
good
as
he
could
make
it
he
thought
little
of
reconstructing
a
paragraph
says
his
biographer
for
the
sake
of
one
happy
illustration
he
submitted
to
the
most
tiresome
mechanical
drudgery
in
the
correction
of
his
the
clearness
of
his
thought
amid
the
profusion
of
his
knowledge
was
represented
in
his
writing
by
a
remarkable
conciseness
of
expression
his
short
vigorous
sentences
are
compact
with
details
of
fact
yet
rich
with
color
his
terseness
has
been
compared
to
that
of
tacitus
his
power
of
condensation
aptness
of
phrase
and
epithet
and
indomitable
industry
made
him
a
master
of
rhetorical
effect
in
the
use
of
his
multifarious
learning
for
the
illustration
of
his
themes
as
soon
as
his
last
had
been
despatched
to
the
printers
macaulay
at
once
fell
to
reading
a
series
of
historians
from
herodotus
downward
to
measure
his
writings
with
theirs
thucydides
especially
utterly
destroyed
all
the
conceit
which
naturally
would
arise
from
his
unbounded
popularity
as
expressed
in
every
social
and
literary
circle
as
well
as
in
the
reviews
like
michael
angelo
this
englishman
was
never
satisfied
with
his
own
productions
and
the
only
comfort
he
took
in
the
impossibility
of
realizing
his
ideal
was
in
the
comparison
he
made
of
his
own
works
with
similar
ones
by
contemporary
authors
then
he
was
content
and
then
only
appeared
in
his
letters
and
diary
that
feeling
which
arose
from
the
consciousness
that
he
was
one
of
the
most
fortunate
authors
who
had
ever
lived
there
was
nothing
cynical
in
his
sense
of
superiority
but
an
amiable
and
that
only
made
men
smile
as
when
lord
palmerston
remarked
that
he
wished
he
was
as
certain
of
any
one
thing
as
tom
macaulay
was
of
everything
this
rarely
provoked
opposition
except
when
he
was
positive
as
to
things
outside
his
sphere
he
wrote
and
talked
sensibly
and
luminously
on
financial
and
social
questions
on
art
on
poetry
and
the
drama
on
philosophy
and
theology
but
on
these
subjects
he
was
not
an
authority
with
specialists
in
other
words
he
did
not
so
to
speak
know
everything
profoundly
but
only
superficially
yet
in
history
especially
english
history
he
was
profound
in
analysis
as
well
as
brilliant
in
the
narration
of
facts
even
when
there
was
disagreement
between
himself
and
others
as
to
inductions
he
drew
from
those
facts
inductions
colored
by
his
strong
prejudices
and
aristocratic
surroundings
macaulay
was
not
always
consistent
with
his
own
theories
however
for
instance
he
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
progress
of
society
and
of
civilization
he
saw
the
enormous
gulf
between
the
ninth
and
the
nineteenth
centuries
and
the
unmistakable
advance
which
since
the
times
of
hildebrand
the
world
had
made
in
knowledge
in
the
arts
in
liberty
and
in
the
comforts
of
life
although
the
tide
of
progress
had
its
ebb
and
flow
in
different
ages
and
countries
yet
when
he
cast
his
eye
on
america
where
perhaps
the
greatest
progress
had
been
made
in
the
world
history
within
fifty
years
he
saw
nothing
but
melancholy
signs
of
anarchy
and
decay
signs
portending
the
collapse
of
liberty
and
the
triumph
of
ignorance
and
crime
thus
he
writes
in
to
an
american
correspondent
as
long
as
you
have
a
boundless
extent
of
fertile
and
unoccupied
land
your
laboring
population
will
be
far
more
at
ease
than
the
laboring
population
of
the
old
world
but
the
time
will
come
when
wages
will
be
as
low
and
will
fluctuate
as
much
with
you
as
with
us
then
your
institutions
will
fairly
be
brought
to
the
test
distress
everywhere
makes
the
laborer
mutinous
and
discontented
and
inclines
him
to
listen
with
eagerness
to
agitators
who
tell
him
that
it
is
a
monstrous
iniquity
that
one
man
should
have
a
million
while
another
can
not
get
a
full
meal
in
bad
years
there
is
plenty
of
grumbling
here
and
sometimes
a
little
rioting
but
it
matters
little
for
here
the
sufferers
are
not
the
rulers
the
supreme
power
is
in
the
hands
of
a
class
deeply
interested
in
the
security
of
property
and
the
maintenance
of
order
accordingly
the
malcontents
are
restrained
but
with
you
the
majority
is
the
government
and
has
the
rich
who
are
always
in
a
minority
absolutely
at
its
mercy
the
day
will
come
when
the
multitude
of
people
none
of
whom
has
had
more
than
a
half
a
breakfast
or
expects
to
have
more
than
a
half
a
dinner
will
choose
a
legislature
is
it
possible
to
doubt
what
sort
of
legislature
will
be
chosen
on
the
one
side
is
a
statesman
preaching
patience
respect
for
vested
rights
strict
observance
of
the
public
faith
and
on
the
other
a
demagogue
ranting
about
the
tyranny
of
capitalists
and
usurers
and
asking
why
anybody
should
be
permitted
to
drink
champagne
and
ride
in
a
carriage
while
thousands
of
honest
folks
are
in
want
of
necessaries
which
of
the
two
candidates
is
likely
to
be
preferred
by
a
who
hears
his
children
cry
for
more
bread
there
will
be
i
fear
spoliation
the
spoliation
will
increase
the
distress
the
distress
will
produce
fresh
spoliation
there
is
nothing
to
stop
you
your
constitution
is
all
sail
and
no
anchor
either
civilization
or
liberty
will
perish
either
some
caesar
or
napoleon
will
seize
the
reins
of
government
with
a
strong
hand
or
your
republic
will
be
as
fearfully
plundered
and
laid
waste
by
barbarians
in
the
twentieth
century
as
the
roman
empire
was
in
the
fifth
i
do
not
deny
that
there
is
great
force
in
macaulay
reasoning
and
prophecy
history
points
to
decline
and
ruin
when
public
virtue
has
fled
and
government
is
in
the
hands
of
demagogues
for
their
reign
has
ever
been
succeeded
by
military
usurpers
who
have
preserved
civilization
indeed
but
at
the
expense
of
liberty
yet
this
reasoning
applies
not
only
to
america
but
to
england
as
well
especially
since
by
the
reform
bill
and
subsequent
enactments
of
parliament
she
has
opened
the
gates
to
an
increase
of
suffrage
which
now
threatens
to
become
universal
the
enfranchisement
of
the
people
the
enlarged
powers
of
the
individual
under
the
protection
and
control
of
the
commonwealth
is
the
contribution
to
progress
it
is
dangerous
so
is
all
power
until
its
use
is
learned
but
there
is
no
backward
step
possible
the
tremendous
experiment
must
go
forward
for
england
and
america
alike
macaulay
himself
was
one
of
the
most
prominent
of
english
statesmen
and
orators
in
and
to
advocate
the
extension
of
the
right
of
suffrage
and
the
increase
of
popular
liberties
all
his
writings
are
on
the
side
of
liberty
in
england
and
all
are
in
opposition
to
the
toryism
which
was
so
triumphant
during
the
reign
of
george
iii
why
did
he
have
faith
in
the
english
people
of
england
and
yet
show
so
little
in
the
english
people
of
america
he
believed
in
political
and
social
progress
for
his
own
countrymen
why
should
he
doubt
the
utility
of
the
same
in
other
countries
if
vandalism
is
to
be
the
fate
of
america
where
education
the
only
truly
conservative
element
is
more
diffused
than
in
england
why
should
it
not
equally
triumph
in
that
country
when
the
masses
have
gained
political
power
as
they
surely
will
at
some
time
and
even
speedily
if
the
policy
inaugurated
by
gladstone
is
to
triumph
for
england
macaulay
had
unbounded
hope
because
he
believed
in
progress
in
liberty
in
education
in
the
civilizing
influence
of
machinery
in
the
increasing
comforts
of
life
through
the
constant
increase
of
wealth
among
the
middle
classes
and
especially
through
the
power
of
christianity
in
spite
of
the
dissensions
of
sects
the
attacks
of
crude
philosophers
socialists
anarchists
scientists
and
atheists
from
one
end
of
christendom
to
the
other
why
should
he
not
have
equal
faith
in
american
civilization
which
in
spite
of
wars
and
strikes
and
commercial
distresses
and
political
corruption
has
yet
made
a
marked
progress
from
the
time
of
jefferson
the
apostle
of
equality
down
to
our
day
as
seen
especially
in
the
multiplication
of
schools
and
colleges
in
an
untrammelled
and
watchful
press
and
in
the
active
benevolence
of
the
rich
in
the
foundation
of
every
kind
of
institution
to
relieve
misery
and
want
the
truth
is
that
he
in
common
with
most
educated
englishmen
of
his
day
and
of
too
many
even
of
our
own
day
cherished
a
silent
contempt
for
americans
for
their
literature
and
their
institutions
and
hence
he
was
not
only
inconsistent
in
the
principles
which
he
advocated
but
showed
that
he
was
not
emancipated
with
all
his
learning
from
prejudices
of
which
he
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
as
time
made
inroads
on
macaulay
strong
constitution
he
gave
up
both
politics
and
society
in
the
absorbing
interest
which
he
took
in
his
history
confining
himself
to
his
library
and
sometimes
allowing
months
to
pass
without
accepting
any
invitation
whatever
to
a
social
gathering
no
man
was
ever
more
disenchanted
with
society
he
begrudged
his
time
even
when
tempted
by
the
calls
of
friendship
when
visitors
penetrated
to
his
den
he
bowed
them
out
with
ironical
politeness
he
had
no
favors
to
ask
from
friends
or
foes
for
he
declined
political
office
and
was
as
independent
as
wealth
or
fame
could
make
him
in
he
was
made
lord
rector
of
the
university
of
glasgow
and
the
acclamations
following
his
address
were
prodigious
lord
john
russell
gave
to
brother
john
a
living
worth
macaulay
himself
was
offered
the
professorship
of
history
at
cambridge
in
one
year
he
received
for
the
first
edition
of
his
third
and
fourth
volumes
of
the
history
published
in
in
a
single
check
from
longman
at
the
age
of
he
writes
in
his
diary
i
have
no
cause
for
complaint
tolerable
health
competence
liberty
leisure
dear
relatives
and
friends
and
a
very
great
literary
reputation
with
all
this
prosperity
macaulay
now
naturally
set
up
his
carriage
he
dined
often
with
the
queen
and
was
a
great
man
according
to
english
notions
more
even
from
his
wealth
and
social
position
than
from
his
success
in
letters
lord
john
russell
pressed
him
to
accept
a
seat
in
his
cabinet
but
i
told
him
macaulay
writes
that
i
should
be
of
no
use
that
i
was
not
a
debater
that
it
was
too
late
to
become
one
that
my
temper
taste
and
literary
habits
alike
prevented
he
was
however
induced
to
become
again
a
member
of
parliament
and
in
was
elected
once
more
for
edinburgh
which
had
repented
of
its
rejection
of
him
in
but
he
insisted
on
perfect
independence
to
vote
as
he
pleased
he
regarded
this
into
public
life
as
a
great
personal
sacrifice
since
it
might
postpone
the
appearance
of
his
next
two
volumes
of
the
history
his
election
however
was
received
with
great
acclamation
even
professor
wilson
the
most
conservative
of
scotch
tories
voted
for
him
it
was
not
a
party
victory
but
purely
a
personal
triumph
a
serious
illness
now
follows
a
weakness
of
the
heart
from
the
effects
of
which
macaulay
died
a
few
years
afterwards
he
retires
to
clifton
and
gives
himself
up
to
getting
well
visiting
barley
wood
and
driving
in
his
private
carriage
among
the
most
interesting
scenery
in
the
west
of
england
but
he
was
never
perfectly
well
again
although
he
continued
to
work
on
his
history
his
intimate
friends
saw
the
change
in
him
with
sadness
but
he
himself
was
serene
and
uncomplaining
although
he
suffered
from
an
oppression
of
the
chest
he
still
on
great
occasions
addressed
the
house
his
mind
was
clear
but
his
voice
was
faint
the
last
speech
he
made
was
in
behalf
of
the
independence
of
the
scottish
church
the
strain
of
the
house
of
commons
proved
to
be
too
great
for
his
now
enfeebled
constitution
nor
could
he
conceal
from
himself
and
his
friends
says
trevelyan
that
it
was
a
grievous
waste
while
the
reign
of
anne
still
remained
unwritten
for
him
to
consume
his
scanty
stock
of
vigor
in
the
tedious
and
exhaustive
routine
of
political
existence
waiting
whole
evenings
for
the
vote
and
then
trudging
home
at
three
in
the
morning
through
the
slush
of
a
february
thaw
he
therefore
spared
himself
as
a
member
of
parliament
and
carefully
husbanded
his
powers
in
order
to
work
upon
his
book
he
gave
himself
more
time
for
his
annual
vacation
yet
would
write
when
he
could
on
the
subjects
which
engrossed
his
life
his
labors
were
too
severe
for
his
strength
but
he
worked
on
and
even
harder
and
harder
at
length
on
the
of
november
macaulay
sent
to
the
printer
the
last
twenty
pages
of
his
history
and
an
edition
of
thousand
was
ordered
within
a
generation
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
copies
of
the
work
were
sold
in
the
united
kingdom
alone
six
rival
translators
were
engaged
in
turning
it
into
german
and
it
was
published
in
the
polish
the
danish
the
swedish
the
italian
the
french
the
dutch
the
spanish
the
hungarian
the
russian
and
the
bohemian
languages
to
say
nothing
of
its
immense
circulation
in
the
united
states
such
extraordinary
literary
popularity
was
accompanied
by
great
honors
in
macaulay
was
created
a
british
peer
and
elected
lord
high
steward
of
the
borough
of
cambridge
the
academies
of
utrecht
munich
and
turin
elected
him
to
honorary
membership
the
king
of
prussia
made
him
a
member
of
the
order
of
merit
oxford
conferred
on
him
the
degree
of
doctor
of
civil
law
and
he
was
elected
president
of
the
philosophical
institution
of
edinburgh
he
could
have
little
more
in
the
way
of
academic
and
governmental
honors
the
failing
health
of
macaulay
now
compelled
him
to
resign
his
seat
in
the
house
of
commons
it
was
also
thought
desirable
for
him
to
vacate
his
apartments
at
the
albany
which
he
had
occupied
for
fifteen
years
that
he
might
be
more
retired
and
perhaps
more
comfortable
his
friends
at
the
suggestion
of
dean
milman
selected
a
house
in
kensington
the
rooms
of
which
were
small
except
the
library
which
opened
upon
a
beautiful
lawn
adorned
with
flowers
and
shrubs
it
was
called
holly
lodge
and
was
very
secluded
and
attractive
here
his
latter
days
were
spent
in
the
society
of
his
nieces
and
a
few
devoted
friends
and
in
dispensing
simple
hospitalities
his
favorite
form
of
entertainment
was
the
breakfast
at
which
his
guests
would
linger
till
twelve
enchanted
by
his
conversation
for
his
mind
showed
no
signs
of
decay
from
this
charming
retreat
lord
macaulay
very
seldom
appeared
in
london
society
years
passed
without
his
even
accepting
invitations
an
occasional
night
at
a
friend
house
in
the
country
one
or
two
nights
at
windsor
castle
and
one
or
two
visits
to
lord
stanhope
seat
in
kent
in
order
to
consult
his
magnificent
library
were
the
only
visits
which
macaulay
made
in
the
course
of
the
year
he
always
had
a
dislike
of
visiting
in
private
houses
much
preferring
hotels
where
he
could
be
free
from
conventional
life
macaulay
was
always
careful
in
his
expenditures
wasting
nothing
that
he
might
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
charity
for
he
gave
liberally
especially
to
needy
and
unfortunate
men
of
letters
once
he
gave
to
a
total
stranger
who
implored
his
aid
in
his
household
he
was
revered
for
he
was
the
kindest
and
most
considerate
of
masters
while
his
relatives
absolutely
worshipped
him
at
home
he
made
no
claim
to
the
privileges
of
genius
he
had
few
eccentricities
he
never
interfered
with
the
pleasures
of
others
he
never
obtruded
his
advice
or
demanded
that
his
own
views
or
tastes
should
be
consulted
he
was
especially
careful
not
to
wound
the
feelings
of
those
with
whom
he
lived
children
were
his
delight
and
solace
over
them
he
seemed
to
have
unbounded
influence
he
would
spend
the
half
of
a
busy
day
in
playing
with
them
and
in
inventing
new
games
for
their
diversion
one
of
his
pleasures
was
to
take
them
to
see
the
sights
of
london
his
sympathies
were
quick
and
generous
although
apparently
so
cynical
in
his
opinions
of
books
he
was
always
affected
at
any
touches
of
pathos
even
to
tears
it
was
hard
for
macaulay
to
realize
that
the
time
had
come
when
he
must
leave
untold
that
portion
of
english
history
with
which
he
was
more
familiar
than
any
other
living
man
but
he
submitted
to
the
inevitable
without
repining
he
had
done
what
he
could
even
when
he
was
compelled
to
give
up
his
daily
task
his
love
of
reading
remained
a
book
was
his
solace
to
the
last
he
had
no
extensive
acquaintance
with
the
works
of
some
of
the
best
writers
of
his
own
generation
preferring
the
classic
authors
of
antiquity
and
of
england
in
the
time
of
anne
he
did
not
relish
coleridge
or
carlyle
or
buckle
or
ruskin
or
indeed
any
writer
who
seemed
to
strain
after
originality
of
style
in
defiance
of
the
old
and
conservative
canons
he
preferred
miss
austen
to
dickens
he
felt
that
he
owed
a
great
debt
to
the
of
ages
who
reached
perfection
of
style
so
far
as
it
can
be
attained
even
the
english
writers
of
the
reign
of
anne
to
his
mind
have
never
been
surpassed
his
admiration
for
addison
was
unbounded
dryden
and
pope
to
him
were
greater
poets
than
any
who
have
succeeded
them
such
a
poet
as
tennyson
or
wordsworth
he
pretended
he
did
not
understand
he
wanted
transparent
clearness
of
expression
browning
would
have
been
to
him
an
abomination
he
despised
the
poetry
of
his
own
age
with
its
involved
sentences
its
obscurity
and
its
strange
metres
his
own
poetry
was
as
direct
as
homer
as
simple
as
chaucer
and
as
graphic
as
scott
in
macaulay
contrived
to
visit
once
more
the
english
lakes
and
the
western
highlands
where
he
was
received
with
great
veneration
being
recognized
everywhere
on
steamers
and
railway
stations
but
his
cheerfulness
had
now
departed
although
he
made
an
effort
to
be
agreeable
in
december
of
this
year
he
ceased
writing
in
his
diary
the
physicians
pretended
to
think
that
he
was
better
but
fainting
fits
set
in
on
christmas
he
said
but
little
and
was
constantly
dropping
to
sleep
his
relatives
did
not
seem
to
think
that
he
was
in
immediate
danger
but
the
end
was
near
he
died
without
pain
and
was
buried
in
westminster
abbey
on
the
of
january
having
for
the
most
illustrious
men
in
england
he
rests
in
the
poet
corner
amid
the
tombs
of
johnson
and
garrick
handel
and
goldsmith
gay
and
addison
leaving
behind
him
an
immortal
fame
and
what
is
this
fame
it
is
not
that
of
a
philosophical
historian
like
guizot
for
his
history
is
not
marked
by
profound
generalizations
or
even
thoughtful
reflections
he
was
not
a
judicial
historian
like
hallam
seeking
to
present
the
truth
alone
for
he
was
a
partisan
full
of
party
prejudices
nor
was
he
an
historian
like
ranke
raking
out
the
hidden
facts
of
a
remote
period
and
unveiling
the
astute
diplomacy
of
past
ages
macaulay
was
a
great
historical
painter
of
the
realistic
school
whose
pictures
have
never
been
surpassed
or
even
equalled
for
vividness
and
interest
in
this
class
of
historians
he
stands
out
alone
and
peerless
the
most
exciting
and
the
most
interesting
of
all
the
historians
who
have
depicted
the
manners
the
events
and
the
characters
of
a
former
age
never
by
any
accident
dull
but
fatiguing
if
at
all
only
by
his
wealth
of
illustration
and
the
of
his
coloring
he
is
the
titian
of
and
as
such
will
live
like
that
immortal
colorist
critics
may
say
what
they
please
about
his
rhetoric
about
his
partial
statements
about
his
want
of
insight
into
deep
philosophical
questions
but
as
a
painter
who
made
his
figures
stand
out
on
the
historical
canvas
with
unique
vividness
macaulay
can
not
fail
to
be
regarded
as
long
as
the
english
language
is
spoken
or
written
as
one
of
the
great
masters
of
literary
composition
this
was
the
verdict
pronounced
by
the
english
nation
at
large
and
its
great
political
and
literary
leaders
expressed
and
confirmed
it
when
they
gave
him
fortune
and
fame
elevated
him
to
the
peerage
bestowed
on
him
stars
and
titles
and
buried
him
with
august
solemnity
among
those
illustrious
men
who
gave
to
england
its
power
and
glory
shakspeare
or
the
poet

ralph
waldo
emerson
great
men
are
more
distinguished
by
range
and
extent
than
by
originality
if
we
require
the
originality
which
consists
in
weaving
like
a
spider
their
web
from
their
own
bowels
in
finding
clay
and
making
bricks
and
building
the
house
no
great
men
are
original
nor
does
valuable
originality
consist
in
unlikeness
to
other
men
the
hero
is
in
the
press
of
knights
and
the
thick
of
events
and
seeing
what
men
want
and
sharing
their
desire
he
adds
the
needful
length
of
sight
and
of
arm
to
come
at
the
desired
point
the
greatest
genius
is
the
most
indebted
man
a
poet
is
no
saying
what
comes
uppermost
and
because
he
says
everything
saying
at
last
something
good
but
a
heart
in
unison
with
his
time
and
country
there
is
nothing
whimsical
and
fantastic
in
his
production
but
sweet
and
sad
earnest
freighted
with
the
weightiest
convictions
and
pointed
with
the
most
determined
aim
which
any
man
or
class
knows
of

his
times

point
in
the
direction
in

the

and
he
carries
out
the

which

gave
him

builds
a

needed
by
her

and

he
finds

him

out

and
he

have
all
to
do
for
himself
his

would
be
expended
in
the

great
genial
power
one
would
almost
say
consists
in
not
being
original
at
all
in
being
altogether
receptive
in
letting
the

do
all
and
suffering
the
spirit
of
the

to
pass
unobstructed
through
the

shakspeare
youth
fell
in
a
time
when
the
english
people
were
importunate
for
dramatic
entertainments
the
court
took
offence
easily
at
political
allusions
and
attempted
to
suppress
them
the
puritans
a
growing
and
energetic
party
and
the
religious
among
the
anglican
church
would
suppress
them
but
the
people
wanted
them
houses
without
roofs
and
extemporaneous
enclosures
at
country
fairs
were
the
ready
theatres
of
strolling
players
the
people
had
tasted
this
new
joy
and
as
we
could
not
hope
to
suppress
newspapers
now
no
not
by
the
strongest
party
neither
then
could
king
prelate
or
puritan
alone
or
united
suppress
an
organ
which
was
ballad
epic
newspaper
caucus
lecture
punch
and
library
at
the
same
time
probably
king
prelate
and
puritan
all
found
their
own
account
in
it
it
had
become
by
all
causes
a
national
interest
by
no
means
conspicuous
so
that
some
great
scholar
would
have
thought
of
treating
it
in
an
english
history
but
not
a
whit
less
considerable
because
it
was
cheap
and
of
no
account
like

proof
of
its
vitality
is

the
secure
possession
by
the
stage
of
the
public
mind
is
of
the
first
importance
to
the
poet
who
works
for
it
he
loses
no
time
in
idle
experiments
here
is
audience
and
expectation
prepared
in
the
case
of
shakspeare
there
is
much
more
at
the
time
when
he
left
stratford
and
went
up
to
london
a
great
body
of
of
all
dates
and
writers
existed
in
manuscript
and
were
in
turn
produced
on
the
boards
here
is
the
tale
of
troy
which
the
audience
will
bear
hearing
some
part
of
every
week
the
death
of
julius
caesar
and
other
stories
out
of
plutarch
which
they
never
tire
of
a
shelf
full
of
english
history
from
the
chronicles
of
brut
and
arthur
down
to
the
royal
henries
which
men
hear
eagerly
and
a
string
of
doleful
tragedies
merry
italian
tales
and
spanish
voyages
which
all
the
london
know
all
the
mass
has
been
treated
with
more
or
less
skill
by
every
playwright
and
the
prompter
has
the
soiled
and
tattered
manuscripts
it
is
now
no
longer
possible
to
say
who
wrote
them
first
they
have
been
the
property
of
the
theatre
so
long
and
so
many
rising
geniuses
have
enlarged
or
altered
them
inserting
a
speech
or
a
whole
scene
or
adding
a
song
that
no
man
can
any
longer
claim
copyright
in
this
work
of
numbers
happily
no
man
wishes
to
they
are
not
yet
desired
in
that
way
we
have
few
readers
many
spectators
and
hearers
they
had
best
lie
where
they
are
shakspeare
in
common
with
his
comrades
esteemed
the
mass
of
old
plays
waste
stock
in
which
any
experiment
could
be
freely
tried
had
the
which
hedges
about
a
modern
tragedy
existed
nothing
could
have
been
done
the
rude
warm
blood
of
the
living
england
circulated
in
the
play
as
in
and
gave
body
which
he
wanted
to
his
airy
and
majestic
fancy
the
poet
needs
a
ground
in
popular
tradition
on
which
he
may
work
and
which
again
may
restrain
his
art
within
the
due
temperance
it
holds
him
to
the
people
supplies
a
foundation
for
his
edifice
and
in
furnishing
so
much
work
done
to
his
hand
leaves
him
at
leisure
and
in
full
strength
for
the
audacities
of
his
imagination
in
short
the
poet
owes
to
his
legend
what
sculpture
owed
to
the
temple
sculpture
in
egypt
and
in
greece
grew
up
in
subordination
to
architecture
it
was
the
ornament
of
the
temple
wall
at
first
a
rude
relief
carved
on
pediments
then
the
relief
became
bolder
and
a
head
or
arm
was
projected
from
the
wall
the
groups
being
still
arranged
with
reference
to
the
building
which
serves
also
as
a
frame
to
hold
the
figures
and
when
at
last
the
greatest
freedom
of
style
and
treatment
was
reached
the
prevailing
genius
of
architecture
still
enforced
a
certain
calmness
and
continence
in
the
statue
as
soon
as
the
statue
was
begun
for
itself
and
with
no
reference
to
the
temple
or
palace
the
art
began
to
decline
freak
extravagance
and
exhibition
took
the
place
of
the
old
temperance
this
which
the
sculptor
found
in
architecture
the
perilous
irritability
of
poetic
talent
found
in
the
accumulated
dramatic
materials
to
which
the
people
were
already
wonted
and
which
had
a
certain
excellence
which
no
single
genius
however
extraordinary
could
hope
to
create
in
point
of
fact
it
appears
that
shakspeare
did
owe
debts
in
all
directions
and
was
able
to
use
whatever
he
found
and
the
amount
of
indebtedness
may
be
inferred
from
malone
laborious
computations
in
regard
to
the
first
second
and
third
parts
of
henry
in
which
out
of
lines
were
written
by
some
author
preceding
shakspeare
by
him
on
the
foundations
laid
by
his
predecessors
and
were
entirely
his
own
and
the
proceeding
investigation
hardly
leaves
a
single
drama
of
his
absolute
invention
sentence
is
an
important
piece
of
external
history
in
henry
viii
i
think
i
see
plainly
the
cropping
out
of
the
original
rock
on
which
his
own
finer
stratum
was
laid
the
first
play
was
written
by
a
superior
thoughtful
man
with
a
vicious
ear
i
can
mark
his
lines
and
know
well
their
cadence
see
wolsey
soliloquy
and
the
following
scene
with
cromwell
where
instead
of
the
metre
of
shakspeare
whose
secret
is
that
the
thought
constructs
the
tune
so
that
reading
for
the
sense
will
best
bring
out
the
rhythm
here
the
lines
are
constructed
on
a
given
tune
and
the
verse
has
even
a
trace
of
pulpit
eloquence
but
the
play
contains
through
all
its
length
unmistakable
traits
of
hand
and
some
passages
as
the
account
of
the
coronation
are
like
autographs
what
is
odd
the
compliment
to
queen
elizabeth
is
in
the
bad
rhythm
shakespeare
knew
that
tradition
supplies
a
better
fable
than
any
invention
can
if
he
lost
any
credit
of
design
he
augmented
his
resources
and
at
that
day
our
petulant
demand
for
originality
was
not
so
much
pressed
there
was
no
literature
for
the
million
the
universal
reading
the
cheap
press
were
unknown
a
great
poet
who
appears
in
illiterate
times
absorbs
into
his
sphere
all
the
light
which
is
anywhere
radiating
every
intellectual
jewel
every
flower
of
sentiment
it
is
his
fine
office
to
bring
to
his
people
and
he
comes
to
value
his
memory
equally
with
his
invention
he
is
therefore
little
solicitous
whence
his
thoughts
have
been
derived
whether
through
translation
whether
through
tradition
whether
by
travel
in
distant
countries
whether
by
inspiration
from
whatever
source
they
are
equally
welcome
to
his
uncritical
audience
nay
he
borrows
very
near
home
other
men
say
wise
things
as
well
as
he
only
they
say
a
good
many
foolish
things
and
do
not
know
when
they
have
spoken
wisely
he
knows
the
sparkle
of
the
true
stone
and
puts
it
in
high
place
wherever
he
finds
it
such
is
the
happy
position
of
homer
perhaps
of
chaucer
of
saadi
they
felt
that
all
wit
was
their
wit
and
they
are
librarians
and
historiographers
as
well
as
poets
each
romancer
was
heir
and
dispenser
of
all
the
hundred
tales
of
the
world
presenting
thebes
and
pelops
line
and
the
tale
of
troy
divine
the
influence
of
chaucer
is
conspicuous
in
all
our
early
literature
and
more
recently
not
only
pope
and
dryden
have
been
beholden
to
him
but
in
the
whole
society
of
english
writers
a
large
unacknowledged
debt
is
easily
traced
one
is
charmed
with
the
opulence
which
feeds
so
many
pensioners
but
chaucer
is
a
huge
borrower
chaucer
it
seems
drew
continually
through
lydgate
and
caxton
from
guido
di
colonna
whose
latin
romance
of
the
trojan
war
was
in
turn
a
compilation
from
bares
phrygius
ovid
and
statius
then
petrarch
boccaccio
and
the
provençal
poets
are
his
benefactors
the
romaunt
of
the
rose
is
only
judicious
translation
from
william
of
lorris
and
john
of
meung
troilus
and
creseide
from
lollius
of
urbino
the
cock
and
the
fox
from
the
of
marie
the
house
of
fame
from
the
french
or
italian
and
poor
gower
he
uses
as
if
he
were
only
a
or
out
of
which
to
build
his
house
he
steals
by
this
apology
that
what
he
takes
has
no
worth
where
he
finds
it
and
the
greatest
where
he
leaves
it
it
has
come
to
be
practically
a
sort
of
rule
in
literature
that
a
man
having
once
shown
himself
capable
of
original
writing
is
entitled
thenceforth
to
steal
from
the
writings
of
others
at
discretion
thought
is
the
property
of
him
who
can
entertain
it
and
of
him
who
can
adequately
place
it
a
certain
awkwardness
marks
the
use
of
borrowed
thoughts
but
as
soon
as
we
have
learned
what
to
do
with
them
they
become
our
own
thus
all
originality
is
relative
every
thinker
is
retrospective
the
learned
member
of
the
legislature
at
westminster
or
at
washington
speaks
and
votes
for
thousands
show
us
the
constituency
and
the
now
invisible
channels
by
which
the
senator
is
made
aware
of
their
wishes
the
crowd
of
practical
and
knowing
men
who
by
correspondence
or
conversation
are
feeding
him
with
evidence
anecdotes
and
estimates
and
it
will
bereave
his
fine
attitudes
and
resistance
of
something
of
their
impressiveness
as
sir
robert
peel
and
webster
vote
so
locke
and
rousseau
think
for
thousands
and
so
there
were
fountains
all
around
homer
manu
saadi
or
milton
from
which
they
drew
friends
lovers
books
traditions
proverbs
all
perished
which
if
seen
would
go
to
reduce
the
wonder
did
the
bard
speak
with
authority
did
he
feel
himself
overmatched
by
any
companion
the
appeal
is
to
the
consciousness
of
the
writer
is
there
at
last
in
his
breast
a
delphi
whereof
to
ask
concerning
any
thought
or
thing
whether
it
be
verily
so
yea
or
nay
and
to
have
answer
and
to
rely
on
that
all
the
debts
which
such
a
man
could
contract
to
other
wit
would
never
disturb
his
consciousness
of
originality
for
the
ministrations
of
books
and
of
other
minds
are
a
whiff
of
smoke
to
that
most
private
reality
with
which
he
has
conversed
it
is
easy
to
see
that
what
is
best
written
or
done
by
genius
in
the
world
was
no
man
work
but
came
by
wide
social
labor
when
a
thousand
wrought
like
one
sharing
the
same
impulse
our
english
bible
is
a
wonderful
specimen
of
the
strength
and
music
of
the
english
language
but
it
was
not
made
by
one
man
or
at
one
time
but
centuries
and
churches
brought
it
to
perfection
there
never
was
a
time
when
there
was
not
some
translation
existing
the
liturgy
admired
for
its
energy
and
pathos
is
an
anthology
of
the
piety
of
ages
and
nations
a
translation
of
the
prayers
and
forms
of
the
catholic
church
these
collected
too
in
long
periods
from
the
prayers
and
meditations
of
every
saint
and
sacred
writer
all
over
the
world
grotius
makes
the
like
remark
in
respect
to
the
lord
prayer
that
the
single
clauses
of
which
it
is
composed
were
already
in
use
in
the
time
of
christ
in
the
rabbinical
forms
he
picked
out
the
grains
of
gold
the
nervous
language
of
the
common
law
the
impressive
forms
of
our
courts
and
the
precision
and
substantial
truth
of
the
legal
distinctions
are
the
contribution
of
all
the
men
who
have
lived
in
the
countries
where
these
laws
govern
the
translation
of
plutarch
gets
its
excellence
by
being
translation
on
translation
there
never
was
a
time
when
there
was
none
all
the
truly
idiomatic
and
national
phrases
are
kept
and
all
others
successively
picked
out
and
thrown
away
something
like
the
same
process
had
gone
on
long
before
with
the
originals
of
these
books
the
world
takes
liberties
with
vedas
aesop
fables
pilpay
arabian
nights
cid
iliad
robin
hood
scottish
minstrelsy
are
not
the
work
of
single
men
in
the
composition
of
such
works
the
time
thinks
the
market
thinks
the
mason
the
carpenter
the
merchant
the
farmer
the
fop
all
think
for
us
every
book
supplies
its
time
with
one
good
word
every
municipal
law
every
trade
every
folly
of
the
day
and
the
generic
catholic
genius
who
is
not
afraid
or
ashamed
to
owe
his
originality
to
the
originality
of
all
stands
with
the
next
age
as
the
recorder
and
embodiment
of
his
own
we
have
to
thank
the
researches
of
antiquaries
and
the
shakspeare
society
for
ascertaining
the
steps
of
the
english
drama
from
the
mysteries
celebrated
in
churches
and
by
churchmen
and
the
final
detachment
from
the
church
and
the
completion
of
secular
plays
from
ferrex
and
porrex
and
gammer
gurton
needle
down
to
the
possession
of
the
stage
by
the
very
pieces
which
shakspeare
altered
remodelled
and
finally
made
his
own
elated
with
success
and
piqued
by
the
growing
interest
of
the
problem
they
have
left
no
bookstall
unsearched
no
chest
in
a
garret
unopened
no
file
of
old
yellow
accounts
to
decompose
in
damp
and
worms
so
keen
was
the
hope
to
discover
whether
the
boy
shakspeare
poached
or
not
whether
he
held
horses
at
the
theatre
door
whether
he
kept
school
and
why
he
left
in
his
will
only
his
bed
to
anne
hathaway
his
wife
there
is
something
touching
in
the
madness
with
which
the
passing
age
mischooses
the
object
on
which
all
candles
shine
and
all
eyes
are
turned
the
care
with
which
it
registers
every
trifle
touching
queen
elizabeth
and
king
james
and
the
essexes
leicesters
burleighs
and
buckinghams
and
lets
pass
without
a
single
valuable
note
the
founder
of
another
dynasty
which
alone
will
cause
the
tudor
dynasty
to
be
remembered
the
man
who
carries
the
saxon
race
in
him
by
the
inspiration
which
feeds
him
and
on
whose
thoughts
the
foremost
people
of
the
world
are
now
for
some
ages
to
be
nourished
and
minds
to
receive
this
and
not
another
bias
a
popular
player
nobody
suspected
he
was
the
poet
of
the
human
race
and
the
secret
was
kept
as
faithfully
from
poets
and
intellectual
men
as
from
courtiers
and
frivolous
people
bacon
who
took
the
inventory
of
the
human
understanding
for
his
times
never
mentioned
his
name
ben
jonson
though
we
have
strained
his
few
words
of
regard
and
panegyric
had
no
suspicion
of
the
elastic
fame
whose
first
vibrations
he
was
attempting
he
no
doubt
thought
the
praise
he
has
conceded
to
him
generous
and
esteemed
himself
out
of
all
question
the
better
poet
of
the
two
if
it
need
wit
to
know
wit
according
to
the
proverb
shakspeare
time
should
be
capable
of
recognizing
it
sir
henry
wotton
was
born
four
years
after
shakspeare
and
died
years
after
him
and
i
find
among
his

the
following
persons
theodore

with
all
of
whom
exists
some
token
of
his
having
communicated
without
enumerating
many
others
whom
doubtless
he
saw
shakspeare
spenser
jonson
beaumont
massinger
the
two
herberts
marlow
chapman
and
the
rest
since
the
constellation
of
great
men
who
appeared
in
greece
in
the
time
of
pericles
there
was
never
any
such
society
yet
their
genius
failed
them
to
find
out
the
best
head
in
the
universe
our
poet
mask
was
impenetrable
you
can
not
see
the
mountain
near
it
took
a
century
to
make
it
suspected
and
not
until
two
centuries
had
passed
after
his
death
did
any
criticism
which
we
think
adequate
begin
to
appear
it
was
not
possible
to
write
the
history
of
shakspeare
till
now
for
he
is
the
father
of
german
literature
it
was
with
the
introduction
of
shakspeare
into
german
by
lessing
and
the
translation
of
his
works
by
wieland
and
schlegel
that
the
rapid
burst
of
german
literature
was
most
intimately
connected
it
was
not
until
the
nineteenth
century
whose
speculative
genius
is
a
sort
of
living
hamlet
that
the
tragedy
of
hamlet
could
find
such
wondering
readers
now
literature
philosophy
and
thought
are
shakspearized
his
mind
is
the
horizon
beyond
which
at
present
we
do
not
see
our
ears
are
educated
to
music
by
his
rhythm
coleridge
and
goethe
are
the
only
critics
who
have
expressed
our
convictions
with
any
adequate
fidelity
but
there
is
in
all
cultivated
minds
a
silent
appreciation
of
his
superlative
power
and
beauty
which
like
christianity
qualifies
the
period
the
shakspeare
society
have
inquired
in
all
directions
advertised
the
missing
facts
offered
money
for
any
information
that
will
lead
to
proof
and
with
what
result
beside
some
important
illustration
of
the
history
of
the
english
stage
to
which
i
have
adverted
they
have
gleaned
a
few
facts
touching
the
property
and
dealings
in
regard
to
property
of
the
poet
it
appears
that
from
year
to
year
he
owned
a
larger
share
in

theatre
its
wardrobe
and
other
appurtenances
were
his
that
he
bought
an
estate
in
his
native
village
with
his
earnings
as
writer
and
shareholder
that
he
lived
in
the
best
house
in
stratford
was
intrusted
by
his
neighbors
with
their
commissions
in
london
as
of
borrowing
money
and
the
like
that
he
was
a
veritable
farmer
about
the
time
when
he
was
writing
macbeth
he
sues
philip
rogers
in
the
of
stratford
for
shillings
ten
pence
for
corn
delivered
to
him
at
different
times
and
in
all
respects
appears
as
a
good
husband
with
no
reputation
for
eccentricity
or
excess
he
was
a
sort
of
man
an
actor
and
shareholder
in
the
theatre
not
in
any
striking
manner
distinguished
from
other
actors
and
managers
i
admit
the
importance
of
this
information
it
was
well
worth
the
pains
that
have
been
taken
to
procure
it
but
whatever
scraps
of
information
concerning
his
condition
these
researches
may
have
rescued
they
can
shed
no
light
upon
that
infinite
invention
which
is
the
concealed
magnet
of
his
attraction
for
us
we
are
very
clumsy
writers
of
history
we
tell
the
chronicle
of
parentage

birthplace
schooling
schoolmates
earning
of
money

publication
of
books
celebrity
death
and
when
we
have
come
to
an
end
of
this
gossip
no
ray
of
relation
appears
between
it
and
the
and
it
seems
as
if
had
we
dipped
at
random
into
the
modern
plutarch
and
read
any
other
life
there
it
would
have
fitted
the
poems
as
well
it
is
the
essence
of
poetry
to
spring
like
the
rainbow
daughter
of
wonder
from
the
invisible
to
abolish
the
past
and
refuse
all
history

word
leaps
out
immortal
from
all
this
painted
pedantry
and
sweetly
torments
us
with
invitations
to
its
own
inaccessible
homes
i
remember
i
went
once
to
see
the
hamlet
of
a
famed
performer
the
pride
of
the
english
stage
and
all
i
then
heard
and
all
i
now
remember
of

that
in
which
the
tragedian
had
no

simply
question
to
the
ghost
what
may
this
mean
that
thou
dead
corse

in
complete

thus
the
glimpses
of
the

that
imagination
which
dilates
the
closet
he
writes
in
to
the
dimension
crowds
it
with
agents
in
rank
and
order
as
quickly
reduces
the
big
reality
to
be
the
glimpses
of
the
moon
these
tricks
of
his
magic
spoil
for
us
the
illusions
of
the
can
any
biography
shed
light
on
the
localities
into
which
the
midsummer
night
dream
admits
me
did
shakspeare
confide
to
any
notary
or
parish

sacristan
or

in
stratford
the
genesis
of
that
delicate

that
has
kept

the

draws
up

ladder

him
when
the
creative
age
goes
up
to

and
gives
way
to
a
new
age
which
sees
the
works
and
asks
in
vain
for
a
history
shakspeare
is
the
only
biographer
of
shakspeare
and
even
he
can
tell
nothing
except
to
the
shakspeare
in
us
that
is
to
our
most
apprehensive
and
sympathetic
hour
he
can
not
step
from
off
his
tripod
and
give
us
anecdotes
of
his
inspirations
read
the
antique
documents
extricated
analysed
and
compared
by
the
assiduous
dyce
and
collier
and
now
read
one
of
these
skyey
sentences
aerolites
which
seem
to
have
fallen
out
of
heaven
and
which
not
your
experience
but
the
man
within
the
breast
has
accepted
as
words
of
fate
and
tell
me
if
they
match
if
the
former
account
in
any
manner
for
the
latter
or
which
gives
the
most
historical
insight
into
the
man
hence
though
our
external
history
is
so
meagre
yet
with
shakspeare
for
biographer
instead
of
aubrey
and
rowe
we
have
really
the
information
which
is
material
that
which
describes
character
and
fortune
that
which
if
we
were
about
to
meet
the
man
and
deal
with
him
would
most
import
us
to
know
we
have
his
recorded
convictions
on
those
questions
which
knock
for
answer
at
every
heart
on
life
and
death
on
love
on
wealth
and
poverty
on
the
prizes
of
life
and
the
ways
whereby
we
come
at
them
on
the
characters
of
men
and
the
influences
occult
and
open
which
affect
their
fortunes
and
on
those
mysterious
and
demoniacal
powers
which
defy
our
science
and
which
yet
interweave
their
malice
and
their
gift
in
our
brightest
hours
who
ever
read
the
volume
of
the
sonnets
without
finding
that
the
poet
had
there
revealed
under
masks
that
are
no
masks
to
the
intelligent
the
lore
of
friendship
and
of
love
the
confusion
of
sentiments
in
the
most
susceptible
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
intellectual
of
men
what
trait
of
his
private
mind
has
he
hidden
in
his
dramas
one
can
discern
in
his
ample
pictures
of
the
gentleman
and
the
king
what
forms
and
humanities
pleased
him
his
delight
in
troops
of
friends
in
large
hospitality
in
cheerful
giving
let
timon
let
warwick
let
antonio
the
merchant
answer
for
his
great
heart
so
far
from
shakspeare
being
the
least
known
he
is
the
one
person
in
all
modern
history
known
to
us
what
point
of
morals
of
manners
of
economy
of
philosophy
of
religion
of
taste
of
the
conduct
of
life
has
he
not
settled
what
mystery
has
he
not
signified
his
knowledge
of
what
office
or
function
or
district
of
man
work
has
he
not
remembered
what
king
has
he
not
taught
state
as
talma
taught
napoleon
what
maiden
has
not
found
him
finer
than
her
delicacy
what
lover
has
he
not
outloved
what
sage
has
he
not
outseen
what
gentleman
has
he
not
instructed
in
the
rudeness
of
his
behavior
some
able
and
appreciating
critics
think
no
criticism
on
shakspeare
valuable
that
does
not
rest
purely
on
the
dramatic
merit
that
he
is
falsely
judged
as
poet
and
philosopher
i
think
as
highly
as
these
critics
of
his
dramatic
merit
but
still
think
it
secondary
he
was
a
full
man
who
liked
to
talk
a
brain
exhaling
thoughts
and
images
which
seeking
vent
found
the
drama
next
at
hand
had
he
been
less
we
should
have
had
to
consider
how
well
he
filled
his
place
how
good
a
dramatist
he
was
and
he
is
the
best
in
the
world
but
it
turns
out
that
what
he
has
to
say
is
of
that
weight
as
to
withdraw
some
attention
from
the
vehicle
and
he
is
like
some
saint
whose
history
is
to
be
rendered
into
all
languages
into
verse
and
prose
into
songs
and
pictures
and
cut
up
into
proverbs
so
that
the
occasion
which
gave
the
saint
meaning
the
form
of
a
conversation
or
of
a
prayer
or
of
a
code
of
laws
is
immaterial
compared
with
the
universality
of
its
application
so
it
fares
with
the
wise
shakspeare
and
his
book
of
life
he
wrote
the
airs
for
all
our
modern
music
he
wrote
the
text
of
modern
life
the
text
of
manners
he
drew
the
man
of
england
and
europe
the
father
of
the
man
in
america
he
drew
the
man
and
described
the
day
and
what
is
done
in
it
he
read
the
hearts
of
men
and
women
their
probity
and
their
second
thought
and
wiles
the
wiles
of
innocence
and
the
transitions
by
which
virtues
and
vices
slide
into
their
contraries
he
could
divide
the
mother
part
from
the
father
part
in
the
face
of
the
child
or
draw
the
fine
demarcations
of
freedom
and
of
fate
he
knew
the
laws
of
repression
which
make
the
police
of
nature
and
all
the
sweets
and
all
the
terrors
of
human
lot
lay
in
his
mind
as
truly
but
as
softly
as
the
landscape
lies
on
the
eye
and
the
importance
of
this
wisdom
of
life
sinks
the
form
as
of
drama
or
epic
out
of
notice
is
like
making
a
question
concerning
the
paper
on
which
a
king
message
is
written
shakspeare
is
as
much
out
of
the
category
of
eminent
authors
as
he
is
out
of
the
crowd
he
is
inconceivably
wise
the
others
conceivably
a
good
reader
can
in
a
sort
nestle
into
plato
brain
and
think
from
thence
but
not
into
shakspeare
we
are
still
out
of
doors
for
executive
faculty
for
creation
shakspeare
is
unique
no
man
can
imagine
it
better
he
was
the
farthest
reach
of
subtlety
compatible
with
an
individual
self
the
subtilest
of
authors
and
only
just
within
the
possibility
of
authorship
with
this
wisdom
of
life
is
the
equal
endowment
of
imaginative
and
of
lyric
power
he
clothed
the
creatures
of
his
legend
with
form
and
sentiments
as
if
they
were
people
who
had
lived
under
his
roof
and
few
real
men
have
left
such
distinct
characters
as
these
fictions
and
they
spoke
in
language
as
sweet
as
it
was
fit
yet
his
talents
never
seduced
him
into
an
ostentation
nor
did
he
harp
on
one
string
an
omnipresent
humanity
all
his
faculties
give
a
man
of
talents
a
story
to
tell
and
his
partiality
will
presently
appear
he
has
certain
observations
opinions
topics
which
have
some
accidental
prominence
and
which
he
disposes
all
to
exhibit
he
crams
this
part
and
starves
that
other
part
consulting
not
the
fitness
of
the
thing
but
his
fitness
and
strength
but
shakspeare
has
no
peculiarity
no
importunate
topic
but
all
is
duly
given
no
veins
no
curiosities
no
no
no
mannerist
is
he
he
has
no
discoverable
egotism
the
great
he
tells
greatly
the
small
subordinately
he
is
wise
without
emphasis
or
assertion
he
is
strong
as
nature
is
strong
who
lifts
the
land
into
mountain
slopes
without
effort
and
by
the
same
rule
as
she
floats
a
bubble
in
the
air
and
likes
as
well
to
do
the
one
as
the
other
this
makes
that
equality
of
power
in
farce
tragedy
narrative
and
a
merit
so
incessant
that
each
reader
is
incredulous
of
the
perception
of
other
readers
this
power
of
expression
or
of
transferring
the
inmost
truth
of
things
into
music
and
verse
makes
him
the
type
of
the
poet
and
has
added
a
new
problem
to
metaphysics
this
is
that
which
throws
him
into
natural
history
as
a
main
production
of
the
globe
and
as
announcing
new
eras
and
ameliorations
things
were
mirrored
in
his
poetry
without
loss
or
blur
he
could
paint
the
fine
with
precision
the
great
with
compass
the
tragic
and
the
comic
indifferently
and
without
any
distortion
or
favor
he
carried
his
powerful
execution
into
minute
details
to
a
hair
point
finishes
an
eyelash
or
a
dimple
as
firmly
as
he
draws
a
mountain
and
yet
these
like
nature
will
bear
the
scrutiny
of
the
solar
microscope
in
short
he
is
the
chief
example
to
prove
that
more
or
less
of
production
more
or
fewer
pictures
is
a
thing
indifferent
he
had
the
power
to
make
one
picture
daguerre
learned
how
to
let
one
flower
etch
its
image
on
his
plate
of
iodine
and
then
proceeds
at
leisure
to
etch
a
million
there
are
always
objects
but
there
was
never
representation
here
is
perfect
representation
at
last
and
now
let
the
world
of
figures
sit
for
their
portraits
no
recipe
can
be
given
for
the
making
of
a
shakspeare
but
the
possibility
of
the
translation
of
things
into
song
is
demonstrated
his
lyric
power
lies
in
the
genius
of
the
piece
the
sonnets
though
their
excellence
is
lost
in
the
splendor
of
the
dramas
are
as
inimitable
as
they
and
it
is
not
a
merit
of
lines
but
a
total
merit
of
the
piece
like
the
tone
of
voice
of
some
incomparable
person
so
is
this
a
speech
of
poetic
beings
and
any
clause
as
unproducible
now
as
a
whole
poem
though
the
speeches
in
the
plays
and
single
lines
have
a
beauty
which
tempts
the
ear
to
pause
on
them
for
their
euphuism
yet
the
sentence
is
so
loaded
with
meaning
and
so
linked
with
its
foregoers
and
followers
that
the
logician
is
satisfied
his
means
are
as
admirable
as
his
ends
every
subordinate
invention
by
which
he
helps
himself
to
connect
some
irreconcilable
opposites
is
a
poem
too
he
is
not
reduced
to
dismount
and
walk
because
his
horses
are
running
off
with
him
in
some
distant
direction
he
always
rides
the
finest
poetry
was
first
experience
but
the
thought
has
suffered
a
transformation
since
it
was
an
experience
cultivated
men
often
attain
a
good
degree
of
skill
in
writing
verses
but
it
is
easy
to
read
through
their
poems
their
personal
history
any
one
acquainted
with
the
parties
can
name
every
figure
this
is
andrew
and
that
is
rachel
the
sense
thus
remains
prosaic
it
is
a
caterpillar
with
wings
and
not
yet
a
butterfly
in
the
poet
mind
the
fact
has
gone
quite
over
into
the
new
element
of
thought
and
has
lost
all
that
is
exuvial
this
generosity
abides
with
shakspeare
we
say
from
the
truth
and
closeness
of
his
pictures
that
he
knows
the
lesson
by
heart
yet
there
is
not
a
trace
of
egotism
one
more
royal
trait
properly
belongs
to
the
poet
i
mean
his
cheerfulness
without
which
no
man
can
be
a
poet
for
beauty
is
his
aim
he
loves
virtue
not
for
its
obligation
but
for
its
grace
he
delights
in
the
world
in
man
in
woman
for
the
lovely
light
that
sparkles
from
them
beauty
the
spirit
of
joy
and
hilarity
he
sheds
over
the
universe
epicurus
relates
that
poetry
hath
such
charms
that
a
lover
might
forsake
his
mistress
to
partake
of
them
and
the
true
bards
have
been
noted
for
their
firm
and
cheerful
temper
homer
lies
in
sunshine
chaucer
is
glad
and
erect
and
saadi
says
it
was
rumored
abroad
that
i
was
penitent
but
what
had
i
to
do
with
repentance
not
less
sovereign
and
cheerful
much
more
sovereign
and
cheerful
is
the
tone
of
shakspeare
his
name
suggests
joy
and
emancipation
to
the
heart
of
men
if
he
should
appear
in
any
company
of
human
souls
who
would
not
march
in
his
troop
he
touches
nothing
that
does
not
borrow
health
and
longevity
from
his
festal
style
and
now
how
stands
the
account
of
man
with
this
bard
and
benefactor
when
in
solitude
shutting
our
ears
to
the
reverberations
of
his
fame
we
seek
to
strike
the
balance
solitude
has
austere
lessons
it
can
teach
us
to
spare
both
heroes
and
poets
and
it
weighs
shakspeare
also
and
finds
him
to
share
the
halfness
and
imperfection
of
humanity
shakspeare
homer
dante
chaucer
saw
the
splendor
of
meaning
that
plays
over
the
visible
world
knew
that
a
tree
had
another
use
than
for
apples
and
corn
another
than
for
meal
and
the
ball
of
the
earth
than
for
tillage
and
roads
that
these
things
bore
a
second
and
finer
harvest
to
the
mind
being
emblems
of
its
thoughts
and
conveying
in
all
their
natural
history
a
certain
mute
commentary
on
human
life
shakspeare
employed
them
as
colors
to
compose
his
picture
he
rested
in
their
beauty
and
never
took
the
step
which
seemed
inevitable
to
such
genius
namely
to
explore
the
virtue
which
resides
in
these
symbols
and
imparts
this
power
what
is
that
which
they
themselves
say
he
converted
the
elements
which
waited
on
his
command
into
entertainments

the

proved
to
be
the
long

essay
on
the

which
according
to

toland
milton
finished

deposited
with

skinner
it
is
well
known

it

therefore
probable

mr

conjectures
that
he
may
have
fallen
under
the
suspicions
of
the

during
that
persecution
of
the
whigs
which
followed
the
dissolution
of

that

a
general
seizure
of

this

may
have

it

of
a

and
good
man
is
still
in

of
all
to
say
something
of
his
moral
and
intellectual
qualities
nor
we
are
convinced
will
the
severest
of
our
readers
blame
us
if
on
an
occasion
like
the
present
we
turn
for
a
short
time
from
the
topics
of
the
day
to
commemorate
in
all
love
and
reverence
the
genius
and
virtues
of
john
milton
the
poet
the
statesman
the
philosopher
the
glory
of
english
literature
the
champion
and
the
martyr
of
english
liberty
it
is
by
his
poetry
that
milton
is
best
known
and
it
is
of
his
poetry
that
we
wish
first
to
speak
by
the
general
suffrage
of
the
civilized
world
his
place
has
been
assigned
among
the
greatest
masters
of
the
art
his
detractors
however
though
outvoted
have
not
been
silenced
there
are
many
critics
and
some
of
great
name
who
contrive
in
the
same
breath
to
extol
the
poems
and
to
decry
the
poet
the
works
they
acknowledge
considered
in
themselves
may
be
classed
among
the
noblest
productions
of
the
human
mind
but
they
will
not
allow
the
author
to
rank
with
those
great
men
who
born
in
the
infancy
of
civilization
supplied
by
their
own
powers
the
want
of
instruction
and
though
destitute
of
models
themselves
bequeathed
to
posterity
models
which
defy
imitation
milton
it
is
said
inherited
what
his
predecessors
created
he
lived
in
an
enlightened
age
he
received
a
finished
education
and
we
must
therefore
if
we
would
form
a
just
estimate
of
his
powers
make
large
deductions
in
consideration
of
these
advantages
we
venture
to
say
on
the
contrary
paradoxical
as
the
remark
may
appear
that
no
poet
has
ever
had
to
struggle
with
more
unfavorable
circumstances
than
milton
he
doubted
as
he
has
himself
owned
whether
he
had
not
been
born
an
age
too
late
for
this
notion
johnson
has
thought
fit
to
make
him
the
butt
of
much
clumsy
ridicule
the
poet
we
believe
understood
the
nature
of
his
art
better
than
the
critic
he
knew
that
his
poetical
genius
derived
no
advantage
from
the
civilization
which
surrounded
him
or
from
the
learning
which
he
had
acquired
and
he
looked
back
with
something
like
regret
to
the
ruder
age
of
simple
words
and
vivid
impressions
we
think
that
as
civilization
advances
poetry
almost
necessarily
declines
therefore
though
we
fervently
admire
those
great
works
of
imagination
which
have
appeared
in
dark
ages
we
do
not
admire
them
the
more
because
they
have
appeared
in
dark
ages
on
the
contrary
we
hold
that
the
most
wonderful
and
splendid
proof
of
genius
is
a
great
poem
produced
in
a
civilized
age
we
can
not
understand
why
those
who
believe
in
that
most
orthodox
article
of
literary
faith
that
the
earliest
poets
are
generally
the
best
should
wonder
at
the
rule
as
if
it
were
the
exception
surely
the
uniformity
of
the
phenomenon
indicates
a
corresponding
uniformity
in
the
cause
the
fact
is
that
common
observers
reason
from
the
progress
of
the
experimental
sciences
to
that
of
the
imitative
arts
the
improvement
of
the
former
is
gradual
and
slow
ages
are
spent
in
collecting
materials
ages
more
in
separating
and
combining
them
even
when
a
system
has
been
formed
there
is
still
something
to
add
to
alter
or
to
reject
every
generation
enjoys
the
use
of
a
vast
hoard
bequeathed
to
it
by
antiquity
and
transmits
that
hoard
augmented
by
fresh
acquisitions
to
future
ages
in
these
pursuits
therefore
the
first
speculators
lie
under
great
disadvantages
and
even
when
they
fail
are
entitled
to
praise
their
pupils
with
far
inferior
intellectual
powers
speedily
surpass
them
in
actual
attainments
every
girl
who
has
read
marcet
little
dialogues
on
political
economy
could
teach
montague
or
walpole
many
lessons
in
finance
any
intelligent
man
may
now
by
resolutely
applying
himself
for
a
few
years
to
mathematics
learn
more
than
the
great
newton
knew
after
half
a
century
of
study
and
meditation
but
it
is
not
thus
with
music
with
painting
or
with
sculpture
still
less
is
it
thus
with
poetry
the
progress
of
refinement
rarely
supplies
these
arts
with
better
objects
of
imitation
it
may
indeed
improve
the
instruments
which
are
necessary
to
the
mechanical
operations
of
the
musician
the
sculptor
and
the
painter
but
language
the
machine
of
the
poet
is
best
fitted
for
his
purpose
in
its
rudest
state
nations
like
individuals
first
perceive
and
then
abstract
they
advance
from
particular
images
to
general
terms
hence
the
vocabulary
of
an
enlightened
society
is
philosophical
that
of
a
people
is
poetical
this
change
in
the
language
of
men
is
partly
the
cause
and
partly
the
effect
of
a
corresponding
change
in
the
nature
of
their
intellectual
operations
of
a
change
by
which
science
gains
and
poetry
loses
generalization
is
necessary
to
the
advancement
of
knowledge
but
particularity
is
indispensable
to
the
creations
of
the
imagination
in
proportion
as
men
know
more
and
think
more
they
look
less
at
individuals
and
more
at
classes
they
therefore
make
better
theories
and
worse
poems
they
give
us
vague
phrases
instead
of
images
and
personified
qualities
instead
of
men
they
may
be
better
able
to
analyze
human
nature
than
their
predecessors
but
analysis
is
not
the
business
of
the
poet
his
office
is
to
portray
not
to
dissect
he
may
believe
in
a
moral
sense
like
shaftesbury
he
may
refer
all
human
actions
to
like
helvetius
or
he
may
never
think
about
the
matter
at
all
his
creed
on
such
subjects
will
no
more
influence
his
poetry
properly
so
called
than
the
notions
which
a
painter
may
have
conceived
respecting
the
lachrymal
glands
or
the
circulation
of
the
blood
will
affect
the
tears
of
his
niobe
or
the
blushes
of
his
aurora
if
shakespeare
had
written
a
book
on
the
motives
of
human
actions
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
it
would
have
been
a
good
one
it
is
extremely
improbable
that
it
would
have
contained
half
so
much
able
reasoning
on
the
subject
as
is
to
be
found
in
the
fable
of
the
bees
but
could
mandeville
have
created
an
iago
well
as
he
knew
how
to
resolve
characters
into
their
elements
would
he
have
been
able
to
combine
those
elements
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
up
a
man
a
real
living
individual
man
perhaps
no
person
can
be
a
poet
or
can
even
enjoy
poetry
without
a
certain
unsoundness
of
mind
if
anything
which
gives
so
much
pleasure
ought
to
be
called
unsoundness
by
poetry
we
mean
not
all
writing
in
verse
nor
even
all
good
writing
in
verse
our
definition
excludes
many
metrical
compositions
which
on
other
grounds
deserve
the
highest
praise
by
poetry
we
mean
the
art
of
employing
words
in
such
a
manner
as
to
produce
an
illusion
on
the
imagination
the
art
of
doing
by
means
of
words
what
the
painter
does
by
means
of
colors
thus
the
greatest
of
poets
has
described
it
in
lines
universally
admired
for
the
vigor
and
felicity
of
their
diction
and
still
more
valuable
on
account
of
the
just
notion
which
they
convey
of
the
art
in
which
he
excelled
as
imagination
bodies
forth
the
forms
of
things
unknown
the
poet
pen
turns
them
to
shapes
and
gives
to
airy
nothing
a
local
habitation
and
a
name
these
are
the
fruits
of
the
fine
frenzy
which
he
ascribes
to
the
poet
a
fine
frenzy
doubtless
but
still
a
frenzy
truth
indeed
is
essential
to
poetry
but
it
is
the
truth
of
madness
the
reasonings
are
just
but
the
premises
are
false
after
the
first
suppositions
have
been
made
everything
ought
to
be
consistent
but
those
first
suppositions
require
a
degree
of
credulity
which
almost
amounts
to
a
partial
and
temporary
derangement
of
the
intellect
hence
of
all
people
children
are
the
most
imaginative
they
abandon
themselves
without
reserve
to
every
illusion
every
image
which
is
strongly
presented
to
their
mental
eye
produces
on
them
the
effect
of
reality
no
man
whatever
his
sensibility
may
be
is
ever
affected
by
hamlet
or
lear
as
a
little
girl
is
affected
by
the
story
of
poor
red
she
knows
that
it
is
all
false
that
wolves
can
not
speak
that
there
are
no
wolves
in
england
yet
in
spite
of
her
knowledge
she
believes
she
weeps
she
trembles
she
dares
not
go
into
a
dark
room
lest
she
should
feel
the
teeth
of
the
monster
at
her
throat
such
is
the
despotism
of
the
imagination
over
uncultivated
minds
in
a
rude
state
of
society
men
are
children
with
a
greater
variety
of
ideas
it
is
therefore
in
such
a
state
of
society
that
we
may
expect
to
find
the
poetical
temperament
in
its
highest
perfection
in
an
enlightened
age
there
will
be
much
intelligence
much
science
much
philosophy
abundance
of
just
classification
and
subtle
analysis
abundance
of
wit
and
eloquence
abundance
of
verses
and
even
of
good
ones
but
little
poetry
men
will
judge
and
compare
but
they
will
not
create
they
will
talk
about
the
old
poets
and
comment
on
them
and
to
a
certain
degree
enjoy
them
but
they
will
scarcely
be
able
to
conceive
the
effect
which
poetry
produced
on
their
ruder
ancestors
the
agony
the
ecstasy
the
plenitude
of
belief
the
greek
rhapsodists
according
to
plato
could
scarce
recite
homer
without
falling
into
convulsions
the
mohawk
hardly
feels
the
while
he
shouts
his
the
power
which
the
ancient
bards
of
wales
and
germany
exercised
over
their
auditors
seems
to
modern
readers
almost
miraculous
such
feelings
are
very
rare
in
a
civilized
community
and
most
rare
among
those
who
participate
most
in
its
improvements
they
linger
longest
among
the
peasantry
poetry
produces
an
illusion
on
the
eye
of
the
mind
as
a
magic
lantern
produces
an
illusion
on
the
eye
of
the
body
and
as
the
magic
lantern
acts
best
in
a
dark
room
poetry
effects
its
purpose
most
completely
in
a
dark
age
as
the
light
of
knowledge
breaks
in
upon
its
exhibitions
as
the
outlines
of
certainty
become
more
and
more
definite
and
the
shades
of
probability
more
and
more
distinct
the
hues
and
lineaments
of
the
phantoms
which
the
poet
calls
up
grow
fainter
and
fainter
we
can
not
unite
the
incompatible
advantages
of
reality
and
deception
the
clear
discernment
of
truth
and
the
exquisite
enjoyment
of
fiction
he
who
in
an
enlightened
and
literary
society
aspires
to
be
a
great
poet
must
first
become
a
little
child
he
must
take
to
pieces
the
whole
web
of
his
mind
he
must
unlearn
much
of
that
knowledge
which
has
perhaps
constituted
hitherto
his
chief
title
to
superiority
his
very
talents
will
be
a
hinderance
to
him
his
difficulties
will
be
proportioned
to
his
proficiency
in
the
pursuits
which
are
fashionable
among
his
contemporaries
and
that
proficiency
will
in
general
be
proportioned
to
the
vigor
and
activity
of
his
mind
and
it
is
well
if
after
all
his
sacrifices
and
exertions
his
works
do
not
resemble
a
lisping
man
or
a
modern
ruin
we
have
seen
in
our
own
time
great
talents
intense
labor
and
long
meditation
employed
in
this
struggle
against
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
employed
we
will
not
say
absolutely
in
vain
but
with
dubious
success
and
feeble
applause
if
these
reasonings
be
just
no
poet
has
ever
triumphed
over
greater
difficulties
than
milton
he
received
a
learned
education
he
was
a
profound
and
elegant
classical
scholar
he
had
studied
all
the
mysteries
of
rabbinical
literature
he
was
intimately
acquainted
with
every
language
in
modern
europe
from
which
either
pleasure
or
information
was
then
to
be
derived
he
was
perhaps
the
only
poet
of
later
times
who
has
been
distinguished
by
the
excellence
of
his
latin
verse
the
genius
of
petrarch
was
scarcely
of
the
first
order
and
his
poems
in
the
ancient
language
though
much
praised
by
those
who
have
never
read
them
are
wretched
compositions
cowley
with
all
his
admirable
wit
and
ingenuity
had
little
imagination
nor
indeed
do
we
think
his
classical
diction
comparable
to
that
of
milton
the
authority
of
johnson
is
against
us
on
this
point
but
johnson
had
studied
the
bad
writers
of
the
middle
ages
till
he
had
become
utterly
insensible
to
the
augustan
elegance
and
was
as
to
judge
between
two
latin
styles
as
an
habitual
drunkard
to
set
up
for
a
versification
in
a
dead
language
is
an
exotic
a
costly
sickly
imitation
of
that
which
elsewhere
may
be
found
in
healthful
and
spontaneous
perfection
the
soils
on
which
this
rarity
flourishes
are
in
general
as
to
the
production
of
vigorous
native
poetry
as
the
of
a
to
the
growth
of
oaks
that
the
author
of
the
paradise
lost
should
have
written
the
epistle
to
manso
was
truly
wonderful
never
before
were
such
marked
originality
and
such
exquisite
mimicry
found
together
indeed
in
all
the
latin
poems
of
milton
the
artificial
manner
indispensable
to
such
works
is
admirably
preserved
while
at
the
same
time
his
genius
gives
to
them
a
peculiar
charm
an
air
of
nobleness
and
freedom
which
distinguishes
them
from
all
other
writings
of
the
same
class
they
remind
us
of
the
amusements
of
those
angelic
warriors
who
composed
the
cohort
of
gabriel
about
him
exercised
heroic
games
the
unarmed
youth
of
heaven
but
their
heads
celestial
armory
shield
helm
and
spear
hung
high
with
diamond
flaming
and
with
gold
we
can
not
look
upon
the
sportive
exercises
for
which
the
genius
of
milton
ungirds
itself
without
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
gorgeous
and
terrible
panoply
which
it
is
accustomed
to
wear
the
strength
of
his
imagination
triumphed
over
every
obstacle
so
intense
and
ardent
was
the
fire
of
his
mind
that
it
not
only
was
not
suffocated
beneath
the
weight
of
fuel
but
penetrated
the
whole
superincumbent
mass
with
its
own
heat
and
radiance
it
is
not
our
intention
to
attempt
anything
like
a
complete
examination
of
the
poetry
of
milton
the
public
has
long
been
agreed
as
to
the
merit
of
the
most
remarkable
passages
the
incomparable
harmony
of
the
numbers
and
the
excellence
of
that
style
which
no
rival
has
been
able
to
equal
and
no
parodist
to
degrade
which
displays
in
their
highest
perfection
the
idiomatic
powers
of
the
english
tongue
and
to
which
every
ancient
and
every
modern
language
has
contributed
something
of
grace
of
energy
or
of
music
in
the
vast
field
of
criticism
on
which
we
are
entering
innumerable
reapers
have
already
put
their
sickles
yet
the
harvest
is
so
abundant
that
the
negligent
search
of
a
straggling
gleaner
may
be
rewarded
with
a
sheaf
the
most
striking
characteristic
of
the
poetry
of
milton
is
the
extreme
remoteness
of
the
associations
by
means
of
which
it
acts
on
the
reader
its
effect
is
produced
not
so
much
by
what
it
expresses
as
by
what
it
suggests
not
so
much
by
the
ideas
which
it
directly
conveys
as
by
other
ideas
which
are
connected
with
them
he
electrifies
the
mind
through
conductors
the
most
unimaginative
man
must
understand
the
iliad
homer
gives
him
no
choice
and
requires
from
him
no
exertion
but
takes
the
whole
upon
himself
and
sets
the
images
in
so
clear
a
light
that
it
is
impossible
to
be
blind
to
them
the
works
of
milton
can
not
be
comprehended
or
enjoyed
unless
the
mind
of
the
reader
with
that
of
the
writer
he
does
not
paint
a
finished
picture
or
play
for
a
mere
passive
listener
he
sketches
and
leaves
others
to
fill
up
the
outline
he
strikes
the
and
expects
his
hearer
to
make
out
the
melody
we
often
hear
of
the
magical
influence
of
poetry
the
expression
in
general
means
nothing
but
applied
to
the
writings
of
milton
it
is
most
appropriate
his
poetry
acts
like
an
incantation
its
merit
lies
less
in
its
obvious
meaning
than
in
its
occult
power
there
would
seem
at
first
sight
to
be
no
more
in
his
words
than
in
other
words
but
they
are
words
of
enchantment
no
sooner
are
they
pronounced
than
the
past
is
present
and
the
distant
near
new
forms
of
beauty
start
at
once
into
existence
and
all
the
of
the
memory
give
up
their
dead
change
the
structure
of
the
sentence
substitute
one
synonyme
for
another
and
the
whole
effect
is
destroyed
the
spell
loses
its
power
and
he
who
should
then
hope
to
conjure
with
it
would
find
himself
as
much
mistaken
as
cassim
in
the
arabian
tale
when
he
stood
crying
open
wheat
open
barley
to
the
door
that
obeyed
no
sound
but
open
sesame
the
miserable
failure
of
dryden
in
his
attempt
to
translate
into
his
own
diction
some
parts
of
the
paradise
lost
is
a
remarkable
instance
of
this
in
support
of
these
observations
we
may
remark
that
scarcely
any
passages
in
the
poems
of
milton
are
more
generally
known
or
more
frequently
repeated
than
those
which
are
little
more
than
of
names
they
are
not
always
more
appropriate
or
more
melodious
than
other
names
but
they
are
charmed
names
every
one
of
them
is
the
first
link
in
a
long
chain
of
associated
ideas
like
the
of
our
infancy
revisited
in
manhood
like
the
song
of
our
country
heard
in
a
strange
land
they
produce
upon
us
an
effect
wholly
independent
of
their
intrinsic
value
one
transports
us
back
to
a
remote
period
of
history
another
places
us
among
the
novel
scenes
and
manners
of
a
distant
region
a
third
evokes
all
the
dear
classical
recollections
of
childhood
the
the
virgil
the
holiday
and
the
prize
a
fourth
brings
before
us
the
splendid
phantoms
of
chivalrous
romance
the
trophied
lists
the
embroidered
housings
the
quaint
devices
the
haunted
forests
the
enchanted
gardens
the
achievements
of
enamoured
knights
and
the
smiles
of
rescued
princesses
in
none
of
the
works
of
milton
is
his
peculiar
manner
more
happily
displayed
than
in
the
allegro
and
the
penseroso
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
that
the
mechanism
of
language
can
be
brought
to
a
more
exquisite
degree
of
perfection
these
poems
differ
from
others
as
ottar
of
roses
differs
from
ordinary
the
essence
from
the
thin
diluted
mixture
they
are
indeed
not
so
much
poems
as
collections
of
hints
from
each
of
which
the
reader
is
to
make
out
a
poem
for
himself
every
epithet
is
a
text
for
a
stanza
the
comus
and
the
samson
agonistes
are
works
which
though
of
very
different
merit
offer
some
marked
points
of
resemblance
both
are
lyric
poems
in
the
form
of
plays
there
are
perhaps
no
two
kinds
of
composition
so
essentially
dissimilar
as
the
drama
and
the
ode
the
business
of
the
dramatist
is
to
keep
himself
out
of
sight
and
to
let
nothing
appear
but
his
characters
as
soon
as
he
attracts
notice
to
his
personal
feelings
the
illusion
is
broken
the
effect
is
as
unpleasant
as
that
which
is
produced
on
the
stage
by
the
voice
of
a
prompter
or
the
entrance
of
a
hence
it
was
that
the
tragedies
of
byron
were
his
least
successful
performances
they
resemble
those
pasteboard
pictures
invented
by
the
friend
of
children
newbery
in
which
a
single
movable
head
goes
round
twenty
different
bodies
so
that
the
same
face
looks
out
upon
us
successively
from
the
uniform
of
a
hussar
the
furs
of
a
judge
and
the
rags
of
a
beggar
in
all
the
characters
patriots
and
tyrants
haters
and
lovers
the
frown
and
sneer
of
harold
were
discernible
in
an
instant
but
this
species
of
egotism
though
fatal
to
the
drama
is
the
inspiration
of
the
ode
it
is
the
part
of
the
lyric
poet
to
abandon
himself
without
reserve
to
his
own
emotions
between
these
hostile
elements
many
great
men
have
endeavored
to
effect
an
amalgamation
but
never
with
complete
success
the
greek
drama
on
the
model
of
which
the
samson
was
written
sprang
from
the
ode
the
dialogue
was
ingrafted
on
the
chorus
and
naturally
partook
of
its
character
the
genius
of
the
greatest
of
the
athenian
dramatists
with
the
circumstances
under
which
tragedy
made
its
first
appearance
aeschylus
was
head
and
heart
a
lyric
poet
in
his
time
the
greeks
had
far
more
intercourse
with
the
east
than
in
the
days
of
homer
and
they
had
not
yet
acquired
that
immense
superiority
in
war
in
science
and
in
the
arts
which
in
the
following
generation
led
them
to
treat
the
asiatics
with
contempt
from
the
narrative
of
herodotus
it
should
seem
that
they
still
looked
up
with
the
veneration
of
disciples
to
egypt
and
assyria
at
this
period
accordingly
it
was
natural
that
the
literature
of
greece
should
be
tinctured
with
the
oriental
style
and
that
style
we
think
is
discernible
in
the
works
of
pindar
and
aeschylus
the
latter
often
reminds
us
of
the
hebrew
writers
the
book
of
job
indeed
in
conduct
and
diction
bears
a
considerable
resemblance
to
some
of
his
dramas
considered
as
plays
his
works
are
absurd
considered
as
choruses
they
are
above
all
praise
if
for
instance
we
examine
the
address
of
clytemnestra
to
agamemnon
on
his
return
or
the
description
of
the
seven
argive
chiefs
by
the
principles
of
dramatic
writing
we
shall
instantly
condemn
them
as
monstrous
but
if
we
forget
the
characters
and
think
only
of
the
poetry
we
shall
admit
that
it
has
never
been
surpassed
in
energy
and
magnificence
sophocles
made
the
greek
drama
as
dramatic
as
was
consistent
with
its
original
form
his
portraits
of
men
have
a
sort
of
similarity
but
it
is
the
similarity
not
of
a
painting
but
of
a
it
suggests
a
resemblance
but
it
does
not
produce
an
illusion
euripides
attempted
to
carry
the
reform
further
but
it
was
a
task
far
beyond
his
powers
perhaps
beyond
any
powers
instead
of
correcting
what
was
bad
he
destroyed
what
was
excellent
he
substituted
crutches
for
stilts
bad
sermons
for
good
odes
milton
it
is
well
known
admired
euripides
highly
much
more
highly
than
in
our
opinion
euripides
deserved
indeed
the
caresses
which
this
partiality
leads
our
countryman
to
bestow
on
sad
electra
poet
sometimes
remind
us
of
the
beautiful
queen
of
kissing
the
long
ears
of
bottom
at
all
events
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
veneration
for
the
athenian
whether
just
or
not
was
injurious
to
the
samson
agonistes
had
milton
taken
aeschylus
for
his
model
he
would
have
given
himself
up
to
the
lyric
inspiration
and
poured
out
profusely
all
the
treasures
of
his
mind
without
bestowing
a
thought
on
those
dramatic
properties
which
the
nature
of
the
work
rendered
it
impossible
to
preserve
in
the
attempt
to
reconcile
things
in
their
own
nature
inconsistent
he
has
failed
as
every
one
else
must
have
failed
we
can
not
identify
ourselves
with
the
characters
as
in
a
good
play
we
can
not
identify
ourselves
with
the
poet
as
in
a
good
ode
the
conflicting
ingredients
like
an
acid
and
an
alkali
mixed
neutralize
each
other
we
are
by
no
means
insensible
to
the
merits
of
this
celebrated
piece
to
the
severe
dignity
of
the
style
the
graceful
and
pathetic
solemnity
of
the
opening
speech
or
the
wild
and
barbaric
melody
which
gives
so
striking
an
effect
to
the
choral
passages
but
we
think
it
we
confess
the
least
successful
effort
of
the
genius
of
milton
the
comus
is
framed
on
the
model
of
the
italian
masque
as
the
samson
is
framed
on
the
model
of
the
greek
tragedy
it
is
certainly
the
noblest
performance
of
the
kind
which
exists
in
any
language
it
is
as
far
superior
to
the
faithful
shepherdess
as
the
faithful
shepherdess
is
to
the
aminta
or
the
aminta
to
the
pastor
fido
it
was
well
for
milton
that
he
had
here
no
euripides
to
mislead
him
he
understood
and
loved
the
literature
of
modern
italy
but
he
did
not
feel
for
it
the
same
veneration
which
he
entertained
for
the
remains
of
athenian
and
roman
poetry
consecrated
by
so
many
lofty
and
endearing
recollections
the
faults
moreover
of
his
italian
predecessors
were
of
a
kind
to
which
his
mind
had
a
deadly
antipathy
he
could
stoop
to
a
plain
style
sometimes
even
to
a
bald
style
but
false
brilliancy
was
his
utter
aversion
his
muse
had
no
objection
to
a
russet
attire
but
she
turned
with
disgust
from
the
finery
of
guarini
as
tawdry
and
as
paltry
as
the
rags
of
a
on
whatever
ornaments
she
wears
are
of
massive
gold
not
only
dazzling
to
the
sight
but
capable
of
standing
the
severest
test
of
the
crucible
milton
attended
in
the
comus
to
the
distinction
which
he
afterward
neglected
in
the
samson
he
made
his
masque
what
it
ought
to
be
essentially
lyrical
and
dramatic
only
in
semblance
he
has
not
attempted
a
fruitless
struggle
against
a
defect
inherent
in
the
nature
of
that
species
of
composition
and
he
has
therefore
succeeded
wherever
success
was
not
impossible
the
speeches
must
be
read
as
majestic
soliloquies
and
he
who
so
reads
them
will
be
enraptured
with
their
eloquence
their
sublimity
and
their
music
the
interruptions
of
the
dialogue
however
impose
a
constraint
upon
the
writer
and
break
the
illusion
of
the
reader
the
finest
passages
are
those
which
are
lyric
in
form
as
well
as
in
spirit
i
should
much
commend
says
the
excellent
sir
henry
wotton
in
a
letter
to
milton
the
tragical
part
if
the
lyrical
did
not
ravish
me
with
a
certain
dorique
delicacy
in
your
songs
and
odes
whereunto
i
must
plainly
confess
to
you
i
have
seen
yet
nothing
parallel
in
our
language
the
criticism
was
just
it
is
when
milton
escapes
from
the
shackles
of
the
dialogue
when
he
is
discharged
from
the
labor
of
uniting
two
incongruous
styles
when
he
is
at
liberty
to
indulge
his
choral
raptures
without
reserve
that
he
rises
even
above
himself
then
like
his
own
good
genius
bursting
from
the
earthly
form
and
weeds
of
thyrsis
he
stands
forth
in
celestial
freedom
and
beauty
he
seems
to
cry
exultingly
now
my
task
is
smoothly
done
i
can
fly
or
i
can
run
to
skim
the
earth
to
soar
above
the
clouds
to
bathe
in
the
elysian
dew
of
the
rainbow
and
to
inhale
the
balmy
smells
of
nard
and
cassia
which
the
musky
winds
of
the
zephyr
scatter
through
the
cedared
alleys
of
the
hesperides
there
are
several
of
the
minor
poems
of
milton
on
which
we
would
willingly
make
a
few
remarks
still
more
willingly
would
we
enter
into
a
detailed
examination
of
that
admirable
poem
the
paradise
regained
which
strangely
enough
is
scarcely
ever
mentioned
except
as
an
instance
of
the
blindness
of
the
parental
affection
which
men
of
letters
bear
toward
the
offspring
of
their
intellects
that
milton
was
mistaken
in
preferring
this
work
excellent
as
it
is
to
the
paradise
lost
we
readily
admit
but
we
are
sure
that
the
superiority
of
the
paradise
lost
to
the
paradise
regained
is
not
more
decided
than
the
superiority
of
the
paradise
regained
to
every
poem
which
has
since
made
its
appearance
our
limits
however
prevent
us
from
discussing
the
point
at
length
we
hasten
on
to
that
extraordinary
production
which
the
general
suffrage
of
critics
has
placed
in
the
highest
class
of
human
compositions
the
only
poem
of
modern
times
which
can
be
compared
with
the
paradise
lost
is
the
divine
comedy
the
subject
of
milton
in
some
points
resembled
that
of
dante
but
he
has
treated
it
in
a
widely
different
manner
we
can
not
we
think
better
illustrate
our
opinion
respecting
our
own
great
poet
than
by
contrasting
him
with
the
father
of
tuscan
literature
the
poetry
of
milton
differs
from
that
of
dante
as
the
hieroglyphics
of
egypt
differed
from
the
of
mexico
the
images
which
dante
employs
speak
for
themselves
they
stand
simply
for
what
they
are
those
of
milton
have
a
signification
which
is
often
discernible
only
to
the
initiated
their
value
depends
less
on
what
they
directly
represent
than
on
what
they
remotely
suggest
however
strange
however
grotesque
may
be
the
appearance
which
dante
undertakes
to
describe
he
never
shrinks
from
describing
it
he
gives
us
the
shape
the
color
the
sound
the
smell
the
taste
he
counts
the
numbers
he
measures
the
size
his
similes
are
the
illustrations
of
a
traveller
unlike
those
of
other
poets
and
especially
of
milton
they
are
introduced
in
a
plain
manner
not
for
the
sake
of
any
beauty
in
the
objects
from
which
they
are
drawn
not
for
the
sake
of
any
ornament
which
they
may
impart
to
the
poem
but
simply
in
order
to
make
the
meaning
of
the
writer
as
clear
to
the
reader
as
it
is
to
himself
the
ruins
of
the
precipice
which
led
from
the
sixth
to
the
seventh
circle
of
hell
were
like
those
of
the
rock
which
fell
into
the
adige
on
the
south
of
trent
the
cataract
of
phlegethon
was
like
that
of
aqua
cheta
at
the
monastery
of
benedict
the
place
where
the
heretics
were
confined
in
burning
tombs
resembled
the
vast
cemetery
of
arles
now
let
us
compare
with
the
exact
details
of
dante
the
dim
intimations
of
milton
we
will
cite
a
few
examples
the
english
poet
has
never
thought
of
taking
the
measure
of
satan
he
gives
us
merely
a
vague
idea
of
vast
bulk
in
one
passage
the
fiend
lies
stretched
out
huge
in
length
floating
many
a
rood
equal
in
size
to
the
enemies
of
jove
or
to
the
which
the
mariner
mistakes
for
an
island
when
he
addresses
himself
to
battle
against
the
guardian
angels
he
stands
like
teneriffe
or
atlas
his
stature
reaches
the
sky
contrast
with
these
descriptions
the
lines
in
which
dante
has
described
the
gigantic
spectre
of
nimrod
his
face
seemed
to
me
as
long
and
as
broad
as
the
ball
of
peter
at
rome
and
his
other
limbs
were
in
proportion
so
that
the
bank
which
concealed
him
from
the
waist
downwards
nevertheless
showed
so
much
of
him
that
three
tall
germans
would
in
vain
have
attempted
to
reach
to
his
hair
we
are
sensible
that
we
do
no
justice
to
the
admirable
style
of
the
florentine
poet
but
cary
translation
is
not
at
hand
and
our
version
however
rude
is
sufficient
to
illustrate
our
meaning
once
more
compare
the
in
the
eleventh
book
of
the
paradise
lost
with
the
last
ward
of
malebolge
in
dante
milton
avoids
the
loathsome
details
and
takes
refuge
in
indistinct
but
solemn
and
tremendous
imagery
despair
hurrying
from
couch
to
couch
to
mock
the
wretches
with
his
attendance
death
shaking
his
dart
over
them
but
in
spite
of
supplications
delaying
to
strike
what
says
dante
there
was
such
a
moan
there
as
there
would
be
if
all
the
sick
who
between
july
and
september
are
in
the
hospitals
of
valdichiana
and
of
the
tuscan
swamps
and
of
sardinia
were
in
one
pit
together
and
such
a
stench
was
issuing
forth
as
is
wont
to
issue
from
decayed
limbs
we
will
not
take
upon
ourselves
the
invidious
office
of
settling
precedency
between
two
such
writers
each
in
his
own
department
is
incomparable
and
each
we
may
remark
has
wisely
or
fortunately
taken
a
subject
adapted
to
exhibit
his
peculiar
talent
to
the
greatest
advantage
the
divine
comedy
is
a
personal
narrative
dante
is
the
and
of
that
which
he
relates
he
is
the
very
man
who
has
heard
the
tormented
spirits
crying
out
for
the
second
death
who
has
read
the
dusky
characters
on
the
portal
within
which
there
is
no
hope
who
has
hidden
his
face
from
the
terrors
of
the
gorgon
who
has
fled
from
the
hooks
and
the
seething
pitch
of
barbariccia
and
draghignazzo
his
own
hands
have
grasped
the
shaggy
sides
of
lucifer
his
own
feet
have
climbed
the
mountain
of
expiation
his
own
brow
has
been
marked
by
the
purifying
angel
the
reader
would
throw
aside
such
a
tale
in
incredulous
disgust
unless
it
were
told
with
the
strongest
air
of
veracity
with
a
sobriety
even
in
its
horrors
with
the
greatest
precision
and
multiplicity
in
its
details
the
narrative
of
milton
in
this
respect
differs
from
that
of
dante
as
the
adventures
of
amadis
differ
from
those
of
gulliver
the
author
of
amadis
would
have
made
his
book
ridiculous
if
he
had
introduced
those
minute
particulars
which
give
such
a
charm
to
the
work
of
swift
the
nautical
observations
the
affected
delicacy
about
names
the
official
documents
transcribed
at
full
length
and
all
the
unmeaning
gossip
and
scandal
of
the
court
springing
out
of
nothing
and
tending
to
nothing
we
are
not
shocked
at
being
told
that
a
man
who
lived
nobody
knows
when
saw
many
very
strange
sights
and
we
can
easily
abandon
ourselves
to
the
illusion
of
the
romance
but
when
lemuel
gulliver
surgeon
resident
at
rotherhithe
tells
us
of
pigmies
and
giants
flying
islands
and
philosophizing
horses
nothing
but
such
circumstantial
touches
could
produce
for
a
single
moment
a
deception
on
the
imagination
of
all
the
poets
who
have
introduced
into
their
works
the
agency
of
supernatural
beings
milton
has
succeeded
best
here
dante
decidedly
yields
to
him
and
as
this
is
a
point
on
which
many
rash
and
judgments
have
been
pronounced
we
feel
inclined
to
dwell
on
it
a
little
longer
the
most
fatal
error
which
a
poet
can
possibly
commit
in
the
management
of
his
machinery
is
that
of
attempting
to
philosophize
too
much
milton
has
been
often
censured
for
ascribing
to
spirits
many
functions
of
which
spirits
must
be
incapable
but
these
objections
though
sanctioned
by
eminent
names
originate
we
venture
to
say
in
profound
ignorance
of
the
art
of
poetry
what
is
spirit
what
are
our
own
minds
the
portion
of
spirit
with
which
we
are
best
acquainted
we
observe
certain
phenomena
we
can
not
explain
them
into
material
causes
we
therefore
infer
that
there
exists
something
which
is
not
material
but
of
this
something
we
have
no
idea
we
can
define
it
only
by
negatives
we
can
reason
about
it
only
by
symbols
we
use
the
word
but
we
have
no
image
of
the
thing
and
the
business
of
poetry
is
with
images
and
not
with
words
the
poet
uses
words
indeed
but
they
are
merely
the
instruments
of
his
art
not
its
objects
they
are
the
materials
which
he
is
to
dispose
in
such
a
manner
as
to
present
a
picture
to
the
mental
eye
and
if
they
are
not
so
disposed
they
are
no
more
entitled
to
be
called
poetry
than
a
bale
of
canvas
and
a
box
of
colors
to
be
called
a
painting
logicians
may
reason
about
abstractions
but
the
great
mass
of
men
must
have
images
the
strong
tendency
of
the
multitude
in
all
ages
and
nations
to
idolatry
can
be
explained
on
no
other
principle
the
first
inhabitants
of
greece
there
is
reason
to
believe
worshipped
one
invisible
deity
but
the
necessity
of
having
something
more
definite
to
adore
produced
in
a
few
centuries
the
innumerable
crowd
of
gods
and
goddesses
in
like
manner
the
ancient
persians
thought
it
impious
to
exhibit
the
creator
under
a
human
form
yet
even
these
transferred
to
the
sun
the
worship
which
in
speculation
they
considered
due
only
to
the
supreme
mind
the
history
of
the
jews
is
the
record
of
a
continued
struggle
between
pure
theism
supported
by
the
most
terrible
sanctions
and
the
strangely
fascinating
desire
of
having
some
visible
and
tangible
object
of
adoration
perhaps
none
of
the
secondary
causes
which
gibbon
has
assigned
for
the
rapidity
with
which
christianity
spread
over
the
world
while
judaism
scarcely
ever
acquired
a
proselyte
operated
more
powerfully
than
this
feeling
god
the
uncreated
the
incomprehensible
the
invisible
attracted
few
worshippers
a
philosopher
might
admire
so
noble
a
conception
but
the
crowd
turned
away
in
disgust
from
words
which
presented
no
image
to
their
minds
it
was
before
deity
embodied
in
a
human
form
walking
among
men
partaking
of
their
infirmities
leaning
on
their
bosoms
weeping
over
their
graves
slumbering
in
the
manger
bleeding
on
the
cross
that
the
prejudices
of
the
synagogue
and
the
doubts
of
the
academy
and
the
pride
of
the
portico
and
the
fasces
of
the
lictor
and
the
swords
of
thirty
legions
were
humbled
in
the
dust
soon
after
christianity
had
achieved
its
triumph
the
principle
which
had
assisted
it
began
to
corrupt
it
it
became
a
new
paganism
patron
saints
assumed
the
offices
of
household
gods
george
took
the
place
of
mars
elmo
consoled
the
mariner
for
the
loss
of
castor
and
pollux
the
virgin
mother
and
cecilia
succeeded
to
venus
and
muses
the
fascination
of
sex
and
loveliness
was
again
joined
to
that
of
celestial
dignity
and
the
homage
of
chivalry
was
blended
with
that
of
religion
reformers
have
often
made
a
stand
against
these
feelings
but
never
with
more
than
apparent
and
partial
success
the
men
who
demolished
the
images
in
cathedrals
have
not
always
been
able
to
demolish
those
which
were
enshrined
in
their
minds
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
show
that
in
politics
the
same
rule
holds
good
doctrines
we
are
afraid
must
generally
be
embodied
before
they
can
excite
a
strong
public
feeling
the
multitude
is
more
easily
interested
for
the
most
unmeaning
badge
or
the
most
insignificant
name
than
for
the
most
important
principle
from
these
considerations
we
infer
that
no
poet
who
should
affect
that
metaphysical
accuracy
for
the
want
of
which
milton
has
been
blamed
would
escape
a
disgraceful
failure
still
however
there
was
another
extreme
which
though
far
less
dangerous
was
also
to
be
avoided
the
imaginations
of
men
are
in
a
great
measure
under
the
control
of
their
opinions
the
most
exquisite
art
of
poetical
coloring
can
produce
no
illusion
when
it
is
employed
to
represent
that
which
is
at
once
perceived
to
be
incongruous
and
absurd
milton
wrote
in
an
age
of
philosophers
and
theologians
it
was
necessary
therefore
for
him
to
abstain
from
giving
such
a
shock
to
their
understandings
as
might
break
the
charm
which
it
was
his
object
to
throw
over
their
imaginations
this
is
the
real
explanation
of
the
indistinctness
and
inconsistency
with
which
he
has
often
been
reproached
johnson
acknowledges
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
the
spirit
should
be
clothed
with
material
forms
but
says
he
the
poet
should
have
secured
the
consistency
of
his
system
by
keeping
immateriality
out
of
sight
and
seducing
the
reader
to
drop
it
from
his
thoughts
this
is
easily
said
but
what
if
milton
could
not
seduce
his
readers
to
drop
immateriality
from
their
thoughts
what
if
the
contrary
opinion
had
taken
so
full
a
possession
of
the
minds
of
men
as
to
leave
no
room
even
for
the
which
poetry
requires
such
we
suspect
to
have
been
the
case
it
was
impossible
for
the
poet
to
adopt
altogether
the
material
or
the
immaterial
system
he
therefore
took
his
stand
on
the
debatable
ground
he
left
the
whole
in
ambiguity
he
has
doubtless
by
so
doing
laid
himself
open
to
the
charge
of
inconsistency
but
though
philosophically
in
the
wrong
we
can
not
but
believe
that
he
was
poetically
in
the
right
this
task
which
almost
any
other
writer
would
have
found
impracticable
was
easy
to
him
the
peculiar
art
which
he
possessed
of
communicating
his
meaning
circuitously
through
a
long
succession
of
associated
ideas
and
of
intimating
more
than
he
expressed
enabled
him
to
disguise
those
incongruities
which
he
could
not
avoid
poetry
which
relates
to
the
beings
of
another
world
ought
to
be
at
once
mysterious
and
picturesque
that
of
milton
is
so
that
of
dante
is
picturesque
indeed
beyond
any
that
ever
was
written
its
effect
approaches
to
that
produced
by
the
pencil
or
the
chisel
but
it
is
picturesque
to
the
exclusion
of
all
mystery
this
is
a
fault
on
the
right
side
a
fault
inseparable
from
the
plan
of
dante
poem
which
as
we
have
already
observed
rendered
the
utmost
accuracy
of
description
necessary
still
it
is
a
fault
the
supernatural
agents
excite
an
interest
but
it
is
not
the
interest
which
is
proper
to
supernatural
agents
we
feel
that
we
could
talk
to
the
ghosts
and
demons
without
any
emotion
of
unearthly
awe
we
could
like
don
juan
ask
them
to
supper
and
eat
heartily
in
their
company
dante
angels
are
good
men
with
wings
his
devils
are
spiteful
ugly
executioners
his
dead
men
are
merely
living
men
in
strange
situations
the
scene
which
passes
between
the
poet
and
farinata
is
justly
celebrated
still
farinata
in
the
burning
tomb
is
exactly
what
farinata
would
have
been
at
an
nothing
can
be
more
touching
than
the
first
interview
of
dante
and
beatrice
yet
what
is
it
but
a
lovely
woman
chiding
with
sweet
austere
composure
the
lover
for
whose
affection
she
is
grateful
but
whose
vices
she
reprobates
the
feelings
which
give
the
passage
its
charm
would
suit
the
streets
of
florence
as
well
as
the
summit
of
the
mount
of
purgatory
the
spirits
of
milton
are
unlike
those
of
almost
all
other
writers
his
fiends
in
particular
are
wonderful
creations
they
are
not
metaphysical
abstractions
they
are
not
wicked
men
they
are
not
ugly
beasts
they
have
no
horns
no
tails
none
of
the
of
tasso
and
klopstock
they
have
just
enough
in
common
with
human
nature
to
be
intelligible
to
human
beings
their
characters
are
like
their
forms
marked
by
a
certain
dim
resemblance
to
those
of
men
but
exaggerated
to
gigantic
dimensions
and
veiled
in
mysterious
gloom
perhaps
the
gods
and
demons
of
aeschylus
may
best
bear
a
comparison
with
the
angels
and
devils
of
milton
the
style
of
the
athenian
had
as
we
have
remarked
something
of
the
oriental
character
and
the
same
peculiarity
may
be
traced
in
his
mythology
it
has
nothing
of
the
amenity
and
elegance
which
we
generally
find
in
the
superstitions
of
greece
all
is
rugged
barbaric
and
colossal
the
legends
of
aeschylus
seem
to
harmonize
less
with
the
fragrant
groves
and
graceful
porticos
in
which
his
countrymen
paid
their
vows
to
the
god
of
light
and
goddess
of
desire
than
with
those
huge
and
grotesque
labyrinths
of
eternal
granite
in
which
egypt
enshrined
her
mystic
osiris
or
in
which
hindostan
still
bows
down
to
her
idols
his
favorite
gods
are
those
of
the
elder
generation
the
sons
of
heaven
and
earth
compared
with
whom
jupiter
himself
was
a
stripling
and
an
upstart
the
gigantic
titans
and
the
inexorable
furies
foremost
among
his
creations
of
this
class
stands
prometheus
half
fiend
half
redeemer
the
friend
of
man
the
sullen
and
implacable
enemy
of
heaven
prometheus
bears
undoubtedly
a
considerable
resemblance
to
the
satan
of
milton
in
both
we
find
the
same
impatience
of
control
the
same
ferocity
the
same
unconquerable
pride
in
both
characters
also
are
mingled
though
in
very
different
proportions
some
kind
and
generous
feelings
prometheus
however
is
hardly
superhuman
enough
he
talks
too
much
of
his
chains
and
his
uneasy
posture
he
is
rather
too
much
depressed
and
agitated
his
resolution
seems
to
depend
on
the
knowledge
which
he
possesses
that
he
holds
the
fate
of
his
torturer
in
his
hands
and
that
the
hour
of
his
release
will
surely
come
but
satan
is
a
creature
of
another
sphere
the
might
of
his
intellectual
nature
is
victorious
over
the
extremity
of
pain
amidst
agonies
which
can
not
be
conceived
without
horror
he
deliberates
resolves
and
even
exults
against
the
sword
of
michael
against
the
thunder
of
jehovah
against
the
flaming
lake
and
the
marl
burning
with
solid
fire
against
the
prospect
of
an
eternity
of
unintermitted
misery
his
spirit
bears
up
unbroken
resting
on
its
own
innate
energies
requiring
no
support
from
anything
external
nor
even
from
hope
itself
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
parallel
which
we
have
been
attempting
to
draw
between
milton
and
dante
we
would
add
that
the
poetry
of
these
great
men
has
in
a
considerable
degree
taken
its
character
from
their
moral
qualities
they
are
not
egotists
they
rarely
obtrude
their
idiosyncrasies
on
their
readers
they
have
nothing
in
common
with
those
modern
beggars
for
fame
who
extort
a
pittance
from
the
compassion
of
the
inexperienced
by
exposing
the
nakedness
and
sores
of
their
minds
yet
it
would
be
difficult
to
name
two
writers
whose
works
have
been
more
completely
though
undesignedly
colored
by
their
personal
feelings
the
character
of
milton
was
peculiarly
distinguished
by
loftiness
of
spirit
that
of
dante
by
intensity
of
feeling
in
every
line
of
the
divine
comedy
we
discern
the
asperity
which
is
produced
by
pride
struggling
with
misery
there
is
perhaps
no
work
in
the
world
so
deeply
and
uniformly
sorrowful
the
melancholy
of
dante
was
no
fantastic
caprice
it
was
not
as
far
as
at
this
distance
of
time
can
be
judged
the
effect
of
external
circumstances
it
was
from
within
neither
love
nor
glory
neither
the
conflicts
of
earth
nor
the
hope
of
heaven
could
dispel
it
it
turned
every
consolation
and
every
pleasure
into
its
own
nature
it
resembled
that
noxious
sardinian
soil
of
which
the
intense
bitterness
is
said
to
have
been
perceptible
even
in
its
honey
his
mind
was
in
the
noble
language
of
the
hebrew
poet
a
land
of
darkness
as
darkness
itself
and
where
the
light
was
as
darkness
the
gloom
of
his
character
discolors
all
the
passions
of
men
and
all
the
face
of
nature
and
tinges
with
its
own
livid
hue
the
flowers
of
paradise
and
the
glories
of
the
eternal
throne
all
the
portraits
of
him
are
singularly
characteristic
no
person
can
look
on
the
features
noble
even
to
ruggedness
the
dark
furrows
of
the
cheek
the
haggard
and
woful
stare
of
the
eye
the
sullen
and
contemptuous
curve
of
the
lip
and
doubt
that
they
belong
to
a
man
too
proud
and
too
sensitive
to
be
happy
milton
was
like
dante
a
statesman
and
a
lover
and
like
dante
he
had
been
unfortunate
in
ambition
and
in
love
he
had
survived
his
health
and
his
sight
the
comforts
of
his
home
and
the
prosperity
of
his
party
of
the
great
men
by
whom
he
had
been
distinguished
at
his
entrance
into
life
some
had
been
taken
away
from
the
evil
to
come
some
had
carried
into
foreign
climates
their
unconquerable
hatred
of
oppression
some
were
pining
in
dungeons
and
some
had
poured
forth
their
blood
on
scaffolds
venal
and
licentious
scribblers
with
just
sufficient
talent
to
clothe
the
thoughts
of
a
pander
in
the
style
of
a
bellman
were
now
the
favorite
writers
of
the
sovereign
and
of
the
public
it
was
a
loathsome
herd
which
could
be
compared
to
nothing
so
fitly
as
to
the
rabble
of
comus
grotesque
monsters
half
bestial
half
human
dropping
with
wine
bloated
with
gluttony
and
reeling
in
obscene
dances
amidst
these
that
fair
muse
was
placed
like
the
chaste
lady
of
the
masque
lofty
spotless
and
serene
to
be
chattered
at
and
pointed
at
and
grinned
at
by
the
whole
rout
of
satyrs
and
goblins
if
ever
despondency
and
asperity
could
be
excused
in
any
man
they
might
have
been
excused
in
milton
but
the
strength
of
his
mind
overcame
every
calamity
neither
blindness
nor
gout
nor
age
nor
penury
nor
domestic
afflictions
nor
political
disappointments
nor
abuse
nor
proscription
nor
neglect
had
power
to
disturb
his
sedate
and
majestic
patience
his
spirits
do
not
seem
to
have
been
high
but
they
were
singularly
equable
his
temper
was
serious
perhaps
stern
but
it
was
a
temper
which
no
sufferings
could
render
sullen
or
fretful
such
as
it
was
when
on
the
eve
of
great
events
he
returned
from
his
travels
in
the
prime
of
health
and
manly
beauty
loaded
with
literary
distinctions
and
glowing
with
patriotic
hopes
such
it
continued
to
be
when
after
having
experienced
every
calamity
which
is
incident
to
our
nature
old
poor
sightless
and
disgraced
he
retired
to
his
hovel
to
die
hence
it
was
that
though
he
wrote
the
paradise
lost
at
a
time
of
life
when
images
of
beauty
and
tenderness
are
in
general
beginning
to
fade
even
from
those
minds
in
which
they
have
not
been
effaced
by
anxiety
and
disappointment
he
adorned
it
with
all
that
is
most
lovely
and
delightful
in
the
physical
and
in
the
moral
world
neither
theocritus
nor
ariosto
had
a
finer
or
a
more
healthful
sense
of
the
pleasantness
of
external
objects
or
loved
better
to
luxuriate
amidst
sunbeams
and
flowers
the
songs
of
nightingales
the
juice
of
summer
fruits
and
the
coolness
of
shady
fountains
his
conception
of
love
unites
all
the
voluptuousness
of
the
oriental
harem
and
all
the
gallantry
of
the
chivalric
tournament
with
all
the
pure
and
quiet
affection
of
an
english
fireside
his
poetry
reminds
us
of
the
miracles
of
alpine
scenery
nooks
and
dells
beautiful
as
fairyland
are
embosomed
in
its
most
rugged
and
gigantic
elevations
the
roses
and
myrtles
bloom
unchilled
on
the
verge
of
the
avalanche
traces
indeed
of
the
peculiar
character
of
milton
may
be
found
in
all
his
works
but
it
is
most
strongly
displayed
in
the
sonnets
those
remarkable
poems
have
been
undervalued
by
critics
who
have
not
understood
their
nature
they
have
no
epigrammatic
point
there
is
none
of
the
ingenuity
of
filicaja
in
the
thought
none
of
the
hard
and
brilliant
enamel
of
petrarch
in
the
style
they
are
simple
but
majestic
records
of
the
feelings
of
the
poet
as
little
tricked
out
for
the
public
eye
as
his
diary
would
have
been
a
victory
an
expected
attack
upon
the
city
a
momentary
fit
of
depression
or
exultation
a
jest
thrown
out
against
one
of
his
books
a
dream
which
for
a
short
time
restored
to
him
that
beautiful
face
over
which
the
grave
had
closed
forever
led
him
to
musings
which
without
effort
shaped
themselves
into
verse
the
unity
of
sentiment
and
severity
of
style
which
characterize
these
little
pieces
remind
us
of
the
greek
anthology
or
perhaps
still
more
of
the
collects
of
the
english
liturgy
the
noble
poem
on
the
massacres
of
piedmont
is
strictly
a
collect
in
verse
the
sonnets
are
more
or
less
striking
according
as
the
occasions
which
gave
birth
to
them
are
more
or
less
interesting
but
they
are
almost
without
exception
dignified
by
a
sobriety
and
greatness
of
mind
to
which
we
know
not
where
to
look
for
a
parallel
it
would
indeed
be
scarcely
safe
to
draw
any
decided
inferences
as
to
the
character
of
a
writer
from
passages
directly
egotistical
but
the
qualities
which
we
have
ascribed
to
milton
though
perhaps
most
strongly
marked
in
those
parts
of
his
works
which
treat
of
his
personal
feelings
are
distinguishable
in
every
page
and
impart
to
all
his
writings
prose
and
poetry
english
latin
and
italian
a
strong
family
likeness
his
public
conduct
was
such
as
was
to
be
expected
from
a
man
of
spirit
so
high
and
of
an
intellect
so
powerful
he
lived
at
one
of
the
most
memorable
eras
in
the
history
of
mankind
at
the
very
crisis
of
the
great
conflict
between
oromasdes
and
arimanes
liberty
and
despotism
reason
and
prejudice
that
great
battle
was
fought
for
no
single
generation
for
no
single
land
the
destinies
of
the
human
race
were
staked
on
the
same
cast
with
the
freedom
of
the
english
people
then
were
first
proclaimed
those
mighty
principles
which
have
since
worked
their
way
into
the
depths
of
the
american
forests
which
have
roused
greece
from
the
slavery
and
degradation
of
two
thousand
years
and
which
from
one
end
of
europe
to
the
other
have
kindled
an
unquenchable
fire
in
the
hearts
of
the
oppressed
and
loosed
the
knees
of
the
oppressors
with
an
unwonted
fear
of
those
principles
then
struggling
for
their
infant
existence
milton
was
the
most
devoted
and
eloquent
literary
champion
we
need
not
say
how
much
we
admire
his
public
conduct
but
we
can
not
disguise
from
ourselves
that
a
large
portion
of
his
countrymen
still
think
it
unjustifiable
the
civil
war
indeed
has
been
more
discussed
and
is
less
understood
than
any
event
in
english
history
the
friends
of
liberty
labored
under
the
disadvantage
of
which
the
lion
in
the
fable
complained
so
bitterly
though
they
were
the
conquerors
their
enemies
were
the
painters
as
a
body
the
roundheads
had
done
their
utmost
to
decry
and
ruin
literature
and
literature
was
even
with
them
as
in
the
long
run
it
always
is
with
its
enemies
the
best
book
on
their
side
of
the
question
is
the
charming
narrative
of
hutchinson
may
history
of
the
parliament
is
good
but
it
breaks
off
at
the
most
interesting
crisis
of
the
struggle
the
performance
of
ludlow
is
foolish
and
violent
and
most
of
the
later
writers
who
have
espoused
the
same
cause
oldmixon
for
instance
and
catherine
macaulay
have
to
say
the
least
been
more
distinguished
by
zeal
than
either
by
candor
or
by
skill
on
the
other
side
are
the
most
authoritative
and
the
most
popular
historical
works
in
our
language
that
of
clarendon
and
that
of
hume
the
former
is
not
only
ably
written
and
full
of
valuable
information
but
has
also
an
air
of
dignity
and
sincerity
which
makes
even
the
prejudices
and
errors
with
which
it
abounds
respectable
hume
from
whose
fascinating
narrative
the
great
mass
of
the
reading
public
are
still
contented
to
take
their
opinions
hated
religion
so
much
that
he
hated
liberty
for
having
been
allied
with
religion
and
has
pleaded
the
cause
of
tyranny
with
the
dexterity
of
an
advocate
while
affecting
the
impartiality
of
a
judge
the
public
conduct
of
milton
must
be
approved
or
condemned
according
as
the
resistance
of
the
people
to
charles
the
first
shall
appear
to
be
justifiable
or
criminal
every
man
who
approves
of
the
revolution
of
which
dethroned
james
son
of
charles
on
the
ground
that
he
had
broken
the
fundamental
laws
of
the
kingdom
and
enthroned
william
of
orange
in
his
stead
must
hold
that
the
breach
of
fundamental
laws
on
the
part
of
the
sovereign
justifies
resistance
the
question
then
is
this
had
charles
the
first
broken
the
fundamental
laws
of
england
no
person
can
answer
in
the
negative
unless
he
refuses
credit
not
merely
to
all
the
accusations
brought
against
charles
by
his
opponents
but
to
the
narratives
of
the
warmest
royalists
and
to
the
confessions
of
the
king
himself
if
there
be
any
truth
in
any
historian
of
any
party
who
has
related
the
events
of
that
reign
the
conduct
of
charles
from
his
accession
to
the
meeting
of
the
long
parliament
had
been
a
continued
course
of
oppression
and
treachery
let
those
who
applaud
the
revolution
and
condemn
the
rebellion
mention
one
act
of
james
the
second
to
which
a
parallel
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
history
of
his
father
let
them
lay
their
fingers
on
a
single
article
in
the
declaration
of
right
presented
by
the
two
houses
to
william
and
mary
which
charles
is
not
acknowledged
to
have
violated
he
had
according
to
the
testimony
of
his
own
friends
usurped
the
functions
of
the
legislature
raised
taxes
without
the
consent
of
parliament
and
quartered
troops
on
the
people
in
the
most
illegal
and
vexatious
manner
not
a
single
session
of
parliament
had
passed
without
some
unconstitutional
attack
on
the
freedom
of
debate
the
right
of
petition
was
grossly
violated
arbitrary
judgments
exorbitant
fines
and
unwarranted
imprisonments
were
grievances
of
daily
occurrence
if
these
things
do
not
justify
resistance
the
revolution
was
treason
if
they
do
the
great
rebellion
was
laudable
but
it
is
said
why
not
adopt
milder
measures
why
after
the
king
had
consented
to
so
many
reforms
and
renounced
so
many
oppressive
prerogatives
did
the
parliament
continue
to
rise
in
their
demands
at
the
risk
of
provoking
a
civil
war
the
had
been
given
up
the
had
been
abolished
provision
had
been
made
for
the
frequent
convocation
and
secure
deliberation
of
parliaments
why
not
pursue
an
end
confessedly
good
by
peaceable
and
regular
means
we
recur
again
to
the
analogy
of
the
revolution
why
was
james
driven
from
the
throne
why
was
he
not
retained
upon
conditions
he
too
had
offered
to
call
a
free
parliament
and
to
submit
to
its
decision
all
the
matters
in
dispute
yet
we
are
in
the
habit
of
praising
our
forefathers
who
preferred
a
revolution
a
disputed
succession
a
dynasty
of
strangers
twenty
years
of
foreign
and
intestine
war
a
standing
army
and
a
national
debt
to
the
rule
however
restricted
of
a
tried
and
proved
tyrant
the
long
parliament
acted
on
the
same
principle
and
is
entitled
to
the
same
praise
they
could
not
trust
the
king
he
had
no
doubt
passed
salutary
laws
but
what
assurance
was
there
that
he
would
not
break
them
he
had
renounced
oppressive
prerogatives
but
where
was
the
security
that
he
would
not
resume
them
the
nation
had
to
deal
with
a
man
whom
no
tie
could
bind
a
man
who
made
and
broke
promises
with
equal
facility
a
man
whose
honor
had
been
a
hundred
times
pawned
and
never
redeemed
here
indeed
the
long
parliament
stands
on
still
stronger
ground
than
the
convention
of
no
action
of
james
can
be
compared
to
the
conduct
of
charles
with
respect
to
the
petition
of
right
the
lords
and
commons
present
him
with
a
bill
in
which
the
constitutional
limits
of
his
power
are
marked
out
he
hesitates
he
evades
at
last
he
bargains
to
give
his
assent
for
five
subsidies
the
bill
receives
his
solemn
assent
the
subsidies
are
voted
but
no
sooner
is
the
tyrant
relieved
than
he
returns
at
once
to
all
the
arbitrary
measures
which
he
had
bound
himself
to
abandon
and
violates
all
the
clauses
of
the
very
act
which
he
had
been
paid
to
pass
for
more
than
ten
years
the
people
had
seen
the
rights
which
were
theirs
by
a
double
claim
by
immemorial
inheritance
and
by
recent
purchase
infringed
by
the
perfidious
king
who
had
recognized
them
at
length
circumstances
compelled
charles
to
summon
another
parliament
another
chance
was
given
to
our
fathers
were
they
to
throw
it
away
as
they
had
thrown
away
the
former
were
they
again
to
be
cozened
by
roi
le
were
they
again
to
advance
their
money
on
pledges
which
had
been
forfeited
over
and
over
again
were
they
to
lay
a
second
petition
of
right
at
the
foot
of
the
throne
to
grant
another
lavish
aid
in
exchange
for
another
unmeaning
ceremony
and
then
to
take
their
departure
till
after
ten
years
more
of
fraud
and
oppression
their
prince
should
again
require
a
supply
and
again
repay
it
with
a
perjury
they
were
compelled
to
choose
whether
they
would
trust
a
tyrant
or
conquer
him
we
think
that
they
chose
wisely
and
nobly
the
advocates
of
charles
like
the
advocates
of
other
malefactors
against
whom
overwhelming
evidence
is
produced
generally
decline
all
controversy
about
the
facts
and
content
themselves
with
calling
testimony
to
character
he
had
so
many
private
virtues
and
had
james
the
second
no
private
virtues
was
oliver
cromwell
his
bitterest
enemies
themselves
being
judges
destitute
of
private
virtues
and
what
after
all
are
the
virtues
ascribed
to
charles
a
religious
zeal
not
more
sincere
than
that
of
his
son
and
fully
as
weak
and
and
a
few
of
the
ordinary
household
decencies
which
half
the
tombstones
in
england
claim
for
those
who
lie
beneath
them
a
good
father
a
good
husband
ample
apologies
indeed
for
fifteen
years
of
persecution
tyranny
and
falsehood
we
charge
him
with
having
broken
his
coronation
oath
and
we
are
told
that
he
kept
his
marriage
vow
we
accuse
him
of
having
given
up
his
people
to
the
merciless
inflictions
of
the
most
and
of
prelates
and
the
defence
is
that
he
took
his
little
son
on
his
knee
and
kissed
him
we
censure
him
for
having
violated
the
articles
of
the
petition
of
right
after
having
for
good
and
valuable
consideration
promised
to
observe
them
and
we
are
informed
that
he
was
accustomed
to
hear
prayers
at
six
in
the
morning
it
is
to
such
considerations
as
these
together
with
his
vandyke
dress
his
handsome
face
and
his
peaked
beard
that
he
owes
we
verily
believe
most
of
his
popularity
with
the
present
generation
for
ourselves
we
own
that
we
do
not
understand
the
common
phrase
a
good
man
but
a
bad
king
we
can
as
easily
conceive
a
good
man
and
an
unnatural
father
or
a
good
man
and
a
treacherous
friend
we
can
not
in
estimating
the
character
of
an
individual
leave
out
of
our
consideration
his
conduct
in
the
most
important
of
all
human
relations
and
if
in
that
relation
we
find
him
to
have
been
selfish
cruel
and
deceitful
we
shall
take
the
liberty
to
call
him
a
bad
man
in
spite
of
all
his
temperance
at
table
and
all
his
regularity
at
chapel
we
can
not
refrain
from
adding
a
few
words
respecting
a
topic
on
which
the
defenders
of
charles
are
fond
of
dwelling
if
they
say
he
governed
his
people
ill
he
at
least
governed
them
after
the
example
of
his
predecessors
if
he
violated
their
privileges
it
was
because
their
privileges
had
not
been
accurately
defined
no
act
of
oppression
has
ever
been
imputed
to
him
which
has
not
a
parallel
in
the
annals
of
the
tudors
this
point
hume
has
labored
with
an
art
which
is
as
discreditable
in
a
historical
work
as
it
would
be
admirable
in
a
forensic
address
the
answer
is
short
clear
and
decisive
charles
had
assented
to
the
petition
of
right
he
had
renounced
the
oppressive
powers
said
to
have
been
exercised
by
his
predecessors
and
he
had
renounced
them
for
money
he
was
not
entitled
to
set
up
his
antiquated
claims
against
his
own
recent
release
these
arguments
are
so
obvious
that
it
may
seem
superfluous
to
dwell
upon
them
but
those
who
have
observed
how
much
the
events
of
that
time
are
misrepresented
and
misunderstood
will
not
blame
us
for
stating
the
case
simply
it
is
a
case
of
which
the
simplest
statement
is
the
strongest
the
enemies
of
the
parliament
indeed
rarely
choose
to
take
issue
on
the
great
points
of
the
question
they
content
themselves
with
exposing
some
of
the
crimes
and
follies
to
which
public
commotions
necessarily
give
birth
they
bewail
the
unmerited
fate
of
strafford
they
execrate
the
lawless
violence
of
the
army
they
laugh
at
the
scriptural
names
of
the
preachers
fleecing
their
districts
soldiers
revelling
on
the
spoils
of
a
ruined
peasantry
upstarts
enriched
by
the
public
plunder
taking
possession
of
the
hospitable
firesides
and
hereditary
trees
of
the
old
gentry
boys
smashing
the
beautiful
windows
of
cathedrals
quakers
riding
naked
through
the
shouting
for
king
jesus
agitators
lecturing
from
the
tops
of
tubs
on
the
fate
of
agag
all
these
they
tell
us
were
the
offspring
of
the
great
rebellion
be
it
so
we
are
not
careful
to
answer
in
this
matter
these
charges
were
they
infinitely
more
important
would
not
alter
our
opinion
of
an
event
which
alone
has
made
us
to
differ
from
the
slaves
who
crouch
beneath
despotic
sceptres
many
evils
no
doubt
were
produced
by
the
civil
war
they
were
the
price
of
our
liberty
has
the
acquisition
been
worth
the
sacrifice
it
is
the
nature
of
the
devil
of
tyranny
to
tear
and
rend
the
body
which
he
leaves
are
the
miseries
of
continued
possession
less
horrible
than
the
struggles
of
the
tremendous
exorcism
if
it
were
possible
that
a
people
brought
up
under
an
intolerant
and
arbitrary
system
could
subvert
that
system
without
acts
of
cruelty
and
folly
half
the
objections
to
despotic
power
would
be
removed
we
should
in
that
case
be
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
it
at
least
produces
no
pernicious
effects
on
the
intellectual
and
moral
character
of
a
nation
we
deplore
the
outrages
which
accompany
revolutions
but
the
more
violent
the
outrages
the
more
assured
we
feel
that
a
revolution
was
necessary
the
violence
of
these
outrages
will
always
be
proportioned
to
the
ferocity
and
ignorance
of
the
people
and
the
ferocity
and
ignorance
of
the
people
will
be
proportioned
to
the
oppression
and
degradation
under
which
they
have
been
accustomed
to
live
thus
it
was
in
our
civil
war
the
heads
of
the
church
and
state
reaped
only
that
which
they
had
sown
the
government
had
prohibited
free
discussion
it
had
done
its
best
to
keep
the
people
unacquainted
with
their
duties
and
their
rights
the
retribution
was
just
and
natural
if
our
rulers
suffered
from
popular
ignorance
it
was
because
they
had
themselves
taken
away
the
key
of
knowledge
if
they
were
assailed
with
blind
fury
it
was
because
they
had
exacted
an
equally
blind
submission
it
is
the
character
of
such
revolutions
that
we
always
see
the
worst
of
them
at
first
till
men
have
been
some
time
free
they
know
not
how
to
use
their
freedom
the
natives
of
wine
countries
are
generally
sober
in
climates
where
wine
is
a
rarity
intemperance
abounds
a
newly
liberated
people
may
be
compared
to
a
northern
army
encamped
on
the
rhine
or
the
xeres
it
is
said
that
when
soldiers
in
such
a
situation
find
themselves
able
to
indulge
without
restraint
in
such
a
rare
and
expensive
luxury
nothing
is
to
be
seen
but
intoxication
soon
however
plenty
teaches
discretion
and
after
wine
has
been
for
a
few
months
their
daily
fare
they
become
more
temperate
than
they
had
ever
been
in
their
own
country
in
the
same
manner
the
final
and
permanent
fruits
of
liberty
are
wisdom
moderation
and
mercy
its
immediate
effects
are
often
atrocious
crimes
conflicting
errors
scepticism
on
points
the
most
clear
dogmatism
on
points
the
most
mysterious
it
is
just
at
this
crisis
that
its
enemies
love
to
exhibit
it
they
pull
down
the
scaffolding
from
the
edifice
they
point
to
the
flying
dust
the
falling
bricks
the
comfortless
rooms
the
frightful
irregularity
of
the
whole
appearance
and
then
ask
in
scorn
where
the
promised
splendor
and
comfort
is
to
be
found
if
such
miserable
sophisms
were
to
prevail
there
would
never
be
a
good
house
or
a
good
government
in
the
world
ariosto
tells
a
pretty
story
of
a
fairy
who
by
some
mysterious
law
of
her
nature
was
condemned
to
appear
at
certain
seasons
in
the
form
of
a
foul
and
poisonous
snake
those
who
injured
her
during
the
period
of
her
disguise
were
forever
excluded
from
participation
in
the
blessings
which
she
bestowed
but
to
those
who
in
spite
of
her
loathsome
aspect
pitied
and
protected
her
she
afterwards
revealed
herself
in
the
beautiful
and
celestial
form
which
was
natural
to
her
accompanied
their
steps
granted
all
their
wishes
filled
their
houses
with
wealth
made
them
happy
in
love
and
victorious
in
war
such
a
spirit
is
liberty
at
times
she
takes
the
form
of
a
hateful
reptile
she
grovels
she
hisses
she
stings
but
woe
to
those
who
in
disgust
shall
venture
to
crush
her
and
happy
are
those
who
having
dared
to
receive
her
in
her
degraded
and
frightful
shape
shall
at
length
be
rewarded
by
her
in
the
time
of
her
beauty
and
her
glory
there
is
only
one
cure
for
the
evils
which
newly
acquired
freedom
produces
and
that
cure
is
freedom
when
a
prisoner
first
leaves
his
cell
he
can
not
bear
the
light
of
day
he
is
unable
to
discriminate
colors
or
recognize
faces
but
the
remedy
is
not
to
remand
him
into
his
dungeon
but
to
accustom
him
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
blaze
of
truth
and
liberty
may
at
first
dazzle
and
bewilder
nations
which
have
become
in
the
house
of
bondage
but
let
them
gaze
on
and
they
will
soon
be
able
to
bear
it
in
a
few
years
men
learn
to
reason
the
extreme
violence
of
opinions
subsides
hostile
theories
correct
each
other
the
scattered
elements
of
truth
cease
to
contend
and
begin
to
coalesce
and
at
length
a
system
of
justice
and
order
is
educed
out
of
the
chaos
many
politicians
of
our
time
are
in
the
habit
of
laying
it
down
as
a
proposition
that
no
people
ought
to
be
free
till
they
are
fit
to
use
their
freedom
the
maxim
is
worthy
of
the
fool
in
the
old
story
who
resolved
not
to
go
into
the
water
till
he
had
learned
to
swim
if
men
are
to
wait
for
liberty
till
they
become
wise
and
good
in
slavery
they
may
indeed
wait
forever
therefore
it
is
that
we
decidedly
approve
of
the
conduct
of
milton
and
the
other
wise
and
good
men
who
in
spite
of
much
that
was
ridiculous
and
hateful
in
the
conduct
of
their
associates
stood
by
the
cause
of
public
liberty
we
are
not
aware
that
the
poet
has
been
charged
with
personal
participation
in
any
of
the
blamable
excesses
of
that
time
the
favorite
topic
of
his
enemies
is
the
line
of
conduct
which
he
pursued
with
regard
to
the
execution
of
the
king
of
that
celebrated
proceeding
we
by
no
means
approve
still
we
must
say
in
justice
to
the
many
eminent
persons
who
concurred
in
it
and
in
justice
more
particularly
to
the
eminent
person
who
defended
it
that
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
than
the
imputations
which
for
the
last
hundred
and
sixty
years
it
has
been
the
fashion
to
cast
upon
the
regicides
we
disapprove
we
repeat
of
the
execution
of
charles
not
because
the
constitution
exempts
the
king
from
responsibility
for
we
know
that
all
such
maxims
however
excellent
have
their
exceptions
nor
because
we
feel
any
peculiar
interest
in
his
character
for
we
think
that
his
sentence
describes
him
with
perfect
justice
as
a
tyrant
a
traitor
a
murderer
and
a
public
enemy
but
because
we
are
convinced
that
the
measure
was
most
injurious
to
the
cause
of
freedom
he
whom
it
removed
was
a
captive
and
a
hostage
his
heir
to
whom
the
allegiance
of
every
royalist
was
instantly
transferred
was
at
large
the
presbyterians
could
never
have
been
perfectly
reconciled
to
the
father
they
had
no
such
rooted
enmity
to
the
son
the
great
body
of
the
people
also
contemplated
that
proceeding
with
feelings
which
however
unreasonable
no
government
could
safely
venture
to
outrage
but
though
we
think
the
conduct
of
the
regicides
blamable
that
of
milton
appears
to
us
in
a
very
different
light
the
deed
was
done
it
could
not
be
undone
the
evil
was
incurred
and
the
object
was
to
render
it
as
small
as
possible
we
censure
the
chiefs
of
the
army
for
not
yielding
to
the
popular
opinion
but
we
can
not
censure
milton
for
wishing
to
change
that
opinion
the
very
feeling
which
would
have
restrained
us
from
committing
the
act
would
have
led
us
after
it
had
been
committed
to
defend
it
against
the
ravings
of
servility
and
superstition
for
the
sake
of
public
liberty
we
wish
that
the
thing
had
not
been
done
while
the
people
disapproved
of
it
but
for
the
sake
of
public
liberty
we
should
also
have
wished
the
people
to
approve
of
it
when
it
was
done
we
wish
to
add
a
few
words
relative
to
another
subject
on
which
the
enemies
of
milton
delight
to
dwell
his
conduct
during
the
administration
of
the
protector
that
an
enthusiastic
votary
of
liberty
should
accept
office
under
a
military
usurper
seems
no
doubt
at
first
sight
extraordinary
but
all
the
circumstances
in
which
the
country
was
then
placed
were
extraordinary
the
ambition
of
oliver
was
of
no
vulgar
kind
he
never
seems
to
have
coveted
despotic
power
he
at
first
fought
sincerely
and
manfully
for
the
parliament
and
never
deserted
it
till
it
had
deserted
its
duty
if
he
dissolved
it
by
force
it
was
not
till
he
found
that
the
few
members
who
remained
after
so
many
deaths
secessions
and
expulsions
were
desirous
to
appropriate
to
themselves
a
power
which
they
held
only
in
trust
and
to
inflict
upon
england
the
curse
of
a
venetian
oligarchy
but
even
when
thus
placed
by
violence
at
the
head
of
affairs
he
did
not
assume
unlimited
power
he
gave
the
country
a
constitution
far
more
perfect
than
any
which
had
at
that
time
been
known
in
the
world
he
reformed
the
representative
system
in
a
manner
which
has
extorted
praise
even
from
lord
clarendon
for
himself
he
demanded
indeed
the
first
place
in
the
commonwealth
but
with
powers
scarcely
so
great
as
those
of
a
dutch
stadtholder
or
an
american
president
he
gave
the
parliament
a
voice
in
the
appointment
of
ministers
and
left
to
it
the
whole
legislative
authority
not
even
reserving
to
himself
a
veto
on
its
enactments
and
he
did
not
require
that
the
chief
magistracy
should
be
hereditary
in
his
family
thus
far
we
think
if
the
circumstances
of
the
time
and
the
opportunities
which
he
had
of
aggrandizing
himself
be
fairly
considered
he
will
not
lose
by
comparison
with
washington
or
bolivar
had
his
moderation
been
met
by
corresponding
moderation
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
he
would
have
overstepped
the
line
which
he
had
traced
for
himself
but
when
he
found
that
his
parliaments
questioned
the
authority
under
which
they
met
and
that
he
was
in
danger
of
being
deprived
of
the
restricted
power
which
was
absolutely
necessary
to
his
personal
safety
then
it
must
be
acknowledged
he
adopted
a
more
arbitrary
policy
yet
though
we
believe
that
the
intentions
of
cromwell
were
at
first
honest
though
we
believe
that
he
was
driven
from
the
noble
course
which
he
had
marked
out
for
himself
by
the
almost
irresistible
force
of
circumstances
though
we
admire
in
common
with
all
men
of
all
parties
the
ability
and
energy
of
his
splendid
administration
we
are
not
pleading
for
arbitrary
and
lawless
power
even
in
his
hands
we
know
that
a
good
constitution
is
infinitely
better
than
the
best
despot
but
we
suspect
that
at
the
time
of
which
we
speak
the
violence
of
religious
and
political
enmities
rendered
a
stable
and
happy
settlement
next
to
impossible
the
choice
lay
not
between
cromwell
and
liberty
but
between
cromwell
and
the
stuarts
that
milton
chose
well
no
man
can
doubt
who
fairly
compares
the
events
of
the
protectorate
with
those
of
the
thirty
years
which
succeeded
it
the
darkest
and
most
disgraceful
in
the
english
annals
cromwell
was
evidently
laying
though
in
an
irregular
manner
the
foundations
of
an
admirable
system
never
before
had
religious
liberty
and
the
freedom
of
discussion
been
enjoyed
in
a
greater
degree
never
had
the
national
honor
been
better
upheld
abroad
or
the
seat
of
justice
better
filled
at
home
and
it
was
rarely
that
any
opposition
which
stopped
short
of
open
rebellion
provoked
the
resentment
of
the
liberal
and
magnanimous
usurper
the
institutions
which
he
had
established
as
set
down
in
the
instrument
of
government
and
the
humble
petition
and
advice
were
excellent
his
practice
it
is
true
too
often
departed
from
the
theory
of
these
institutions
but
had
he
lived
a
few
years
longer
it
is
probable
that
his
institutions
would
have
survived
him
and
that
his
arbitrary
practice
would
have
died
with
him
his
power
had
not
been
consecrated
by
ancient
prejudices
it
was
upheld
only
by
his
great
personal
qualities
little
therefore
was
to
be
dreaded
from
a
second
protector
unless
he
were
also
a
second
oliver
cromwell
the
events
which
followed
his
decease
are
the
most
complete
vindication
of
those
who
exerted
themselves
to
uphold
his
authority
his
death
dissolved
the
whole
frame
of
society
the
army
rose
against
the
parliament
the
different
corps
of
the
army
against
each
other
sect
raved
against
sect
party
plotted
against
party
the
presbyterians
in
their
eagerness
to
be
revenged
on
the
independents
sacrificed
their
own
liberty
and
deserted
all
their
old
principles
without
casting
one
glance
on
the
past
or
requiring
one
stipulation
for
the
future
they
threw
down
their
freedom
at
the
feet
of
the
most
frivolous
and
heartless
of
tyrants
then
came
those
days
never
to
be
recalled
without
a
blush
the
days
of
servitude
without
loyalty
and
sensuality
without
love
of
dwarfish
talents
and
gigantic
vices
the
paradise
of
cold
hearts
and
narrow
minds
the
golden
age
of
the
coward
the
bigot
and
the
slave
the

to
his
rival
that
he
might
trample

his
people
sank
into
a
viceroy
of
france
and
pocketed
with
complacent
infamy
her
degrading
insults
and
her
more
degrading
gold
the
caresses
of
harlots
and
the
jests
of
buffoons

the

the

had
just
ability
enough
to
deceive
and
just

enough
to

the
principles
of

were
the
scoff
of
every
grinning
courtier

the
anathema
maranatha
of
every
fawning

to

the

accursed

was
a
second

driven
forth
to
wander
on
the
face
of

earth
and

shaking
of

to
the
nations
most
of
the
remarks
which
we
have
hitherto
made
on
the
public
character
of
milton
apply
to
him
only
as
one
of
a
large
body
we
shall
proceed
to
notice
some
of
the
peculiarities
which
distinguished
him
from
his
contemporaries
and
for
that
purpose
it
is
necessary
to
take
a
short
survey
of
the
parties
into
which
the
political
world
was
at
that
time
divided
we
must
premise
that
our
observations
are
intended
to
apply
only
to
those
who
adhered
from
a
sincere
preference
to
one
or
to
the
other
side
in
days
of
public
commotion
every
faction
like
an
oriental
army
is
attended
by
a
crowd
of
a
useless
and
heartless
rabble
who
prowl
round
its
line
of
march
in
the
hope
of
picking
up
something
under
its
protection
but
desert
it
in
the
day
of
battle
and
often
join
to
exterminate
it
after
a
defeat
england
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
treating
abounded
with
fickle
and
selfish
politicians
who
transferred
their
support
to
every
government
as
it
rose
who
kissed
the
hand
of
the
king
in
and
spat
in
his
face
in
who
shouted
with
equal
glee
when
cromwell
was
inaugurated
at
westminster
hall
and
when
he
was
dug
up
to
be
hanged
at
tyburn
who
dined
on
calves
heads
or
stuck
up
as
circumstances
altered
without
the
slightest
shame
or
repugnance
these
we
leave
out
of
the
account
we
take
our
estimate
of
parties
from
those
who
really
deserve
to
be
called
partisans
we
would
speak
first
of
the
puritans
the
most
remarkable
body
of
men
perhaps
which
the
world
has
ever
produced
the
odious
and
ridiculous
parts
of
their
character
lie
on
the
surface
he
that
runs
may
read
them
nor
have
there
been
wanting
attentive
and
malicious
observers
to
point
them
out
for
many
years
after
the
restoration
they
were
the
theme
of
unmeasured
invective
and
derision
they
were
exposed
to
the
utmost
licentiousness
of
the
press
and
of
the
stage
at
the
time
when
the
press
and
the
stage
were
most
licentious
they
were
not
men
of
letters
they
were
as
a
body
unpopular
they
could
not
defend
themselves
and
the
public
would
not
take
them
under
its
protection
they
were
therefore
abandoned
without
reserve
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
satirists
and
dramatists
the
ostentatious
simplicity
of
their
dress
their
sour
aspect
their
nasal
twang
their
stiff
posture
their
long
graces
their
hebrew
names
the
scriptural
phrases
which
they
introduced
on
every
occasion
their
contempt
of
human
learning
their
detestation
of
polite
amusements
were
indeed
fair
game
for
the
laughers
but
it
is
not
from
the
laughers
alone
that
the
philosophy
of
history
is
to
be
learned
and
he
who
approaches
this
subject
should
carefully
guard
against
the
influence
of
that
potent
ridicule
which
has
already
misled
so
many
excellent
writers
ecco
il
fonte
del
riso

il
rio
che
mortali

those
who
roused
the
people
to
resistance
who
directed
their
measures
through
a
long
series
of
eventful
years
who
formed
out
of
the
most
unpromising
materials
the
finest
army
that
europe
had
ever
seen
who
trampled
down
king
church
and
aristocracy
who
in
the
short
intervals
of
domestic
sedition
and
rebellion
made
the
name
of
england
terrible
to
every
nation
on
the
face
of
the
earth
were
no
vulgar
fanatics
most
of
their
absurdities
were
mere
external
badges
like
the
signs
of
freemasonry
or
the
dresses
of
friars
we
regret
that
these
badges
were
not
more
attractive
we
regret
that
a
body
to
whose
courage
and
talents
mankind
has
owed
inestimable
obligations
had
not
the
lofty
elegance
which
distinguished
some
of
the
adherents
of
charles
the
first
or
the
easy
for
which
the
court
of
charles
the
second
was
celebrated
but
if
we
must
make
our
choice
we
shall
like
bassanio
in
the
play
turn
from
the
specious
caskets
which
contain
only
the
head
and
the
fool
head
and
fix
on
the
plain
leaden
chest
which
conceals
the
treasure
the
puritans
were
men
whose
minds
had
derived
a
peculiar
character
from
the
daily
contemplation
of
superior
beings
and
eternal
interests
not
content
with
acknowledging
in
general
terms
an
overruling
providence
they
habitually
ascribed
every
event
to
the
will
of
the
great
being
for
whose
power
nothing
was
too
vast
for
whose
inspection
nothing
was
too
minute
to
know
him
to
serve
him
to
enjoy
him
was
with
them
the
great
end
of
existence
they
rejected
with
contempt
the
ceremonious
homage
which
other
sects
substituted
for
the
pure
worship
of
the
soul
instead
of
catching
occasional
glimpses
of
the
deity
through
an
obscuring
veil
they
aspired
to
gaze
full
on
his
intolerable
brightness
and
to
commune
with
him
face
to
face
hence
originated
their
contempt
for
terrestrial
distinctions
the
difference
between
the
greatest
and
the
meanest
of
mankind
seemed
to
vanish
when
compared
with
the
boundless
interval
which
separated
the
whole
race
from
him
on
whom
their
own
eyes
were
constantly
fixed
they
recognized
no
title
to
superiority
but
his
favor
and
confident
of
that
favor
they
despised
all
the
accomplishments
and
all
the
dignities
of
the
world
if
they
were
unacquainted
with
the
works
of
philosophers
and
poets
they
were
deeply
read
in
the
oracles
of
god
if
their
names
were
not
found
in
the
registers
of
heralds
they
were
recorded
in
the
book
of
life
if
their
steps
were
not
accompanied
by
a
splendid
train
of
menials
legions
of
ministering
angels
had
charge
over
them
their
palaces
were
houses
not
made
with
hands
their
diadems
crowns
of
glory
which
should
never
fade
away
on
the
rich
and
the
eloquent
on
nobles
and
priests
they
looked
down
with
contempt
for
they
esteemed
themselves
rich
in
a
more
precious
treasure
and
eloquent
in
a
more
sublime
language
nobles
by
the
right
of
an
earlier
creation
and
priests
by
the
imposition
of
a
mightier
hand
the
very
meanest
of
them
was
a
being
to
whose
fate
a
mysterious
and
terrible
importance
belonged
on
whose
slightest
action
the
spirits
of
light
and
darkness
looked
with
anxious
interest
who
had
been
destined
before
heaven
and
earth
were
created
to
enjoy
a
felicity
which
should
continue
when
heaven
and
earth
should
have
passed
away
events
which
politicians
ascribed
to
earthly
causes
had
been
ordained
on
his
account
for
his
sake
empires
had
risen
and
flourished
and
decayed
for
his
sake
the
almighty
had
proclaimed
his
will
by
the
pen
of
the
evangelist
and
the
harp
of
the
prophet
he
had
been
wrested
by
no
common
deliverer
from
the
grasp
of
no
common
foe
he
had
been
ransomed
by
the
sweat
of
no
vulgar
agony
by
the
blood
of
no
earthly
sacrifice
it
was
for
him
that
the
sun
had
been
darkened
that
the
rocks
had
been
rent
that
the
dead
had
risen
that
all
nature
had
shuddered
at
the
sufferings
of
her
expiring
god
thus
the
puritan
was
made
up
of
two
different
men
the
one
all
penitence
gratitude
passion
the
other
proud
calm
inflexible
sagacious
he
prostrated
himself
in
the
dust
before
his
maker
but
he
set
his
foot
on
the
neck
of
his
king
in
his
devotional
retirement
he
prayed
with
convulsions
and
groans
and
tears
he
was
half
maddened
by
glorious
or
terrible
illusions
he
heard
the
lyres
of
angels
or
the
tempting
whispers
of
fiends
he
caught
a
gleam
of
the
beatific
vision
or
woke
screaming
from
dreams
of
everlasting
fire
like
vane
he
thought
himself
intrusted
with
the
sceptre
of
the
millennial
year
like
fleetwood
he
cried
in
the
bitterness
of
his
soul
that
god
had
hid
his
face
from
him
but
when
he
took
his
seat
in
the
council
or
girt
on
his
sword
for
war
these
tempestuous
workings
of
the
soul
had
left
no
perceptible
trace
behind
them
people
who
saw
nothing
of
the
godly
but
their
uncouth
visages
and
heard
nothing
from
them
but
their
groans
and
their
whining
hymns
might
laugh
at
them
but
those
had
little
reason
to
laugh
who
encountered
them
in
the
hall
of
debate
or
on
the
field
of
battle
these
fanatics
brought
to
civil
and
military
affairs
a
coolness
of
judgment
and
an
immutability
of
purpose
which
some
writers
have
thought
inconsistent
with
their
religious
zeal
but
which
were
in
fact
the
necessary
effects
of
it
the
intensity
of
their
feelings
on
one
subject
made
them
tranquil
on
every
other
one
overpowering
sentiment
had
subjected
to
itself
pity
and
hatred
ambition
and
fear
death
had
lost
its
terrors
and
pleasure
its
charms
they
had
their
smiles
and
their
tears
their
raptures
and
their
sorrows
but
not
for
the
things
of
this
world
enthusiasm
had
made
them
stoics
had
cleared
their
minds
from
every
vulgar
passion
and
prejudice
and
raised
them
above
the
influence
of
danger
and
of
corruption
it
sometimes
might
lead
them
to
pursue
unwise
ends
but
never
to
choose
unwise
means
they
went
through
the
world
like
sir
artegal
iron
man
talus
with
his
flail
crushing
and
trampling
down
oppressors
mingling
with
human
beings
but
having
neither
part
nor
lot
in
human
infirmities
insensible
to
fatigue
to
pleasure
and
to
pain
not
to
be
pierced
by
any
weapon
not
to
be
withstood
by
any
barrier
such
we
believe
to
have
been
the
character
of
the
puritans
we
perceive
the
absurdity
of
their
manners
we
dislike
the
sullen
gloom
of
their
domestic
habits
we
acknowledge
that
the
tone
of
their
minds
was
often
injured
by
straining
after
things
too
high
for
mortal
reach
and
we
know
that
in
spite
of
their
hatred
of
popery
they
too
often
fell
into
the
worst
vices
of
that
bad
system
intolerance
and
extravagant
austerity
that
they
had
their
anchorites
and
their
crusades
their
dunstans
and
their
de
montforts
their
dominics
and
their
escobars
yet
when
all
circumstances
are
taken
into
consideration
we
do
not
hesitate
to
pronounce
them
a
brave
a
wise
an
honest
and
a
useful
body
the
puritans
espoused
the
cause
of
civil
liberty
mainly
because
it
was
the
cause
of
religion
there
was
another
party
by
no
means
numerous
but
distinguished
by
learning
and
ability
which
acted
with
them
on
very
different
principles
we
speak
of
those
whom
cromwell
was
accustomed
to
call
the
heathens
men
who
were
in
the
phraseology
of
that
time
doubting
thomases
or
careless
gallios
with
regard
to
religious
subjects
but
passionate
worshippers
of
freedom
heated
by
the
study
of
ancient
literature
they
set
up
their
country
as
their
idol
and
proposed
to
themselves
the
heroes
of
plutarch
as
their
examples
they
seem
to
have
borne
some
resemblance
to
the
brissotines
of
the
french
revolution
but
it
is
not
very
easy
to
draw
the
line
of
distinction
between
them
and
their
devout
associates
whose
tone
and
manner
they
sometimes
found
it
convenient
to
affect
and
sometimes
it
is
probable
imperceptibly
adopted
we
now
come
to
the
royalists
we
shall
attempt
to
speak
of
them
as
we
have
spoken
of
their
antagonists
with
perfect
candor
we
shall
not
charge
upon
a
whole
party
the
profligacy
and
baseness
of
the
gamblers
and
bravoes
whom
the
hope
of
license
and
plunder
attracted
from
the
dens
of
whitefriars
to
the
standard
of
charles
and
who
disgraced
their
associates
by
excesses
which
under
the
stricter
discipline
of
the
parliamentary
armies
were
never
tolerated
we
will
select
a
more
favorable
specimen
thinking
as
we
do
that
the
cause
of
the
king
was
the
cause
of
bigotry
and
tyranny
we
yet
can
not
refrain
from
looking
with
complacency
on
the
character
of
the
honest
old
cavaliers
we
feel
a
national
pride
in
comparing
them
with
the
instruments
which
the
despots
of
other
countries
are
compelled
to
employ
with
the
mutes
who
throng
their
antechambers
and
the
janizaries
who
mount
guard
at
their
gates
our
royalist
countrymen
were
not
heartless
dangling
courtiers
bowing
at
every
step
and
simpering
at
every
word
they
were
not
mere
machines
for
destruction
dressed
up
in
uniforms
caned
into
skill
intoxicated
into
valor
defending
without
love
destroying
without
hatred
there
was
a
freedom
in
their
subserviency
a
nobleness
in
their
very
degradation
the
sentiment
of
individual
independence
was
strong
within
them
they
were
indeed
misled
but
by
no
base
or
selfish
motive
compassion
and
romantic
honor
the
prejudices
of
childhood
and
the
venerable
names
of
history
threw
over
them
a
spell
potent
as
that
of
duessa
and
like
the
red
cross
knight
they
thought
that
they
were
doing
battle
for
an
injured
beauty
while
they
defended
a
false
and
loathsome
sorceress
in
truth
they
scarcely
entered
at
all
into
the
merits
of
the
political
question
it
was
not
for
a
treacherous
king
or
an
intolerant
church
that
they
fought
but
for
the
old
banner
which
had
waved
in
so
many
battles
over
the
heads
of
their
fathers
and
for
the
altars
at
which
they
had
received
the
hands
of
their
brides
though
nothing
could
be
more
erroneous
than
their
political
opinions
they
possessed
in
a
far
greater
degree
than
their
adversaries
those
qualities
which
are
the
grace
of
private
life
with
many
of
the
vices
of
the
round
table
they
had
also
many
of
its
virtues
courtesy
generosity
veracity
tenderness
and
respect
for
women
they
had
far
more
both
of
profound
and
of
polite
learning
than
the
puritans
their
manners
were
more
engaging
their
tempers
more
amiable
their
tastes
more
elegant
and
their
households
more
cheerful
milton
did
not
strictly
belong
to
any
of
the
classes
which
we
have
described
he
was
not
a
puritan
he
was
not
a
freethinker
he
was
not
a
royalist
in
his
character
the
noblest
qualities
of
every
party
were
combined
in
harmonious
union
from
the
parliament
and
from
the
court
from
the
conventicle
and
from
the
gothic
cloister
from
the
gloomy
and
sepulchral
circles
of
the
roundheads
and
from
the
christmas
revel
of
the
hospitable
cavalier
his
nature
selected
and
drew
to
itself
whatever
was
great
and
good
while
it
rejected
all
the
base
and
pernicious
ingredients
by
which
those
finer
elements
were
defiled
like
the
puritans
he
lived
as
ever
in
his
great
taskmaster
eye
like
them
he
kept
his
mind
continually
fixed
on
the
almighty
judge
and
an
eternal
reward
and
hence
he
acquired
their
contempt
of
external
circumstances
their
fortitude
their
tranquillity
their
inflexible
resolution
but
not
the
coolest
sceptic
or
the
most
profane
scoffer
was
more
perfectly
free
from
the
contagion
of
their
frantic
delusions
their
savage
manners
their
ludicrous
jargon
their
scorn
of
science
and
their
aversion
to
pleasure
hating
tyranny
with
a
perfect
hatred
he
had
nevertheless
all
the
estimable
and
ornamental
qualities
which
were
almost
entirely
monopolized
by
the
party
of
the
tyrant
there
was
none
who
had
a
stronger
sense
of
the
value
of
literature
a
finer
relish
for
every
elegant
amusement
or
a
more
chivalrous
delicacy
of
honor
and
love
though
his
opinions
were
democratic
his
tastes
and
his
associations
were
such
as
best
harmonize
with
monarchy
and
aristocracy
he
was
under
the
influence
of
all
the
feelings
by
which
the
gallant
cavaliers
were
misled
but
of
those
feelings
he
was
the
master
and
not
the
slave
like
the
hero
of
homer
he
enjoyed
all
the
pleasures
of
fascination
but
he
was
not
fascinated
he
listened
to
the
song
of
the
sirens
yet
he
glided
by
without
being
seduced
to
their
fatal
shore
he
tasted
the
cup
of
circe
but
he
bore
about
him
a
sure
antidote
against
the
effects
of
its
bewitching
sweetness
the
illusions
which
captivated
his
imagination
never
impaired
his
reasoning
powers
the
statesman
was
proof
against
the
splendor
the
solemnity
and
the
romance
which
enchanted
the
poet
any
person
who
will
contrast
the
sentiments
expressed
in
his
treatises
on
prelacy
with
the
exquisite
lines
on
ecclesiastical
architecture
and
music
in
the
penseroso
which
was
published
about
the
same
time
will
understand
our
meaning
this
is
an
inconsistency
which
more
than
anything
else
raises
his
character
in
our
estimation
because
it
shows
how
many
private
tastes
and
feelings
he
sacrificed
in
order
to
do
what
he
considered
his
duty
to
mankind
it
is
the
very
struggle
of
the
noble
othello
his
heart
relents
but
his
hand
is
firm
he
does
naught
in
hate
but
all
in
honor
he
kisses
the
beautiful
deceiver
before
he
destroys
her
that
from
which
the
public
character
of
milton
derives
its
great
and
peculiar
splendor
still
remains
to
be
mentioned
if
he
exerted
himself
to
overthrow
a
forsworn
king
and
a
persecuting
hierarchy
he
exerted
himself
in
conjunction
with
others
but
the
glory
of
the
battle
which
he
fought
for
the
species
of
freedom
which
is
the
most
valuable
and
which
was
then
the
least
understood
the
freedom
of
the
human
mind
is
all
his
own
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
among
his
contemporaries
raised
their
voices
against
and
the
but
there
were
few
indeed
who
discerned
the
more
fearful
evils
of
moral
and
intellectual
slavery
and
the
benefits
which
would
result
from
liberty
of
the
press
and
the
unfettered
exercise
of
private
judgment
these
were
the
objects
which
milton
justly
conceived
to
be
the
most
important
he
was
desirous
that
the
people
should
think
for
themselves
as
well
as
tax
themselves
and
should
be
emancipated
from
the
dominion
of
prejudice
as
well
as
from
that
of
charles
he
knew
that
those
who
with
the
best
intentions
overlooked
these
schemes
of
reform
and
contented
themselves
with
pulling
down
the
king
and
imprisoning
the
malignants
acted
like
the
heedless
brothers
in
his
own
poem
who
in
their
eagerness
to
disperse
the
train
of
the
sorcerer
neglected
the
means
of
liberating
the
captive
they
thought
only
of
conquering
when
they
should
have
thought
of
disenchanting
oh
ye
mistook
ye
should
have
snatched
his
wand
and
bound
him
fast
without
the
rod
reversed
and
backward
mutters
of
dissevering
power
we
can
not
free
the
lady
that
sits
here
bound
in
strong
fetters
fixed
and
motionless
to
reverse
the
rod
to
spell
the
charm
backward
to
break
the
ties
which
bound
a
stupefied
people
to
the
seat
of
enchantment
was
the
noble
aim
of
milton
to
this
all
his
public
conduct
was
directed
for
this
he
joined
the
presbyterians
for
this
he
forsook
them
he
fought
their
perilous
battle
but
he
turned
away
with
disdain
from
their
insolent
triumph
he
saw
that
they
like
those
whom
they
had
vanquished
were
hostile
to
the
liberty
of
thought
he
therefore
joined
the
independents
and
called
upon
cromwell
to
break
the
secular
chain
and
to
save
free
conscience
from
the
paw
of
the
presbyterian
wolf
with
a
view
to
the
same
great
object
he
attacked
the
licensing
system
in
that
sublime
treatise
which
every
statesman
should
wear
as
a
sign
upon
his
hand
and
as
frontlets
between
his
eyes
his
attacks
were
in
general
directed
less
against
particular
abuses
than
against
those
errors
on
which
almost
all
abuses
are
founded
the
servile
worship
of
eminent
men
and
the
irrational
dread
of
innovation
that
he
might
shake
the
foundations
of
these
debasing
sentiments
more
effectually
he
always
selected
for
himself
the
boldest
literary
services
he
never
came
up
in
the
rear
when
the
outworks
had
been
carried
and
the
breach
entered
he
pressed
into
the
forlorn
hope
at
the
beginning
of
the
changes
he
wrote
with
incomparable
energy
and
eloquence
against
the
bishops
but
when
his
opinion
seemed
likely
to
prevail
he
passed
on
to
other
subjects
and
abandoned
prelacy
to
the
crowd
of
writers
who
now
hastened
to
insult
a
falling
party
there
is
no
more
hazardous
enterprise
than
that
of
bearing
the
torch
of
truth
into
those
dark
and
infected
recesses
in
which
no
light
has
ever
shone
but
it
was
the
choice
and
the
pleasure
of
milton
to
penetrate
the
noisome
vapors
and
to
brave
the
terrible
explosion
those
who
most
disapprove
of
his
opinions
must
respect
the
hardihood
with
which
he
maintained
them
he
in
general
left
to
others
the
credit
of
expounding
and
defending
the
popular
parts
of
his
religious
and
political
creed
he
took
his
own
stand
upon
those
which
the
great
body
of
his
countrymen
reprobated
as
criminal
or
derided
as
paradoxical
he
stood
up
for
divorce
and
regicide
he
attacked
the
prevailing
systems
of
education
his
radiant
and
beneficent
career
resembled
that
of
the
god
of
light
and
fertility

it
is
to
be
regretted
that
the
prose
writings
of
milton
should
in
our
time
be
so
little
read
as
compositions
they
deserve
the
attention
of
every
man
who
wishes
to
become
acquainted
with
the
full
power
of
the
english
language
they
abound
with
passages
compared
with
which
the
finest
declamations
of
burke
sink
into
insignificance
they
are
a
perfect
field
of
cloth
of
gold
the
style
is
stiff
with
gorgeous
embroidery
not
even
in
the
earlier
books
of
the
paradise
lost
has
the
great
poet
ever
risen
higher
than
in
those
parts
of
his
controversial
works
in
which
his
feelings
excited
by
conflict
find
a
vent
in
bursts
of
devotional
and
lyrical
rapture
it
is
to
borrow
his
own
majestic
language
a
sevenfold
chorus
of
hallelujahs
and
harping
symphonies
we
had
intended
to
look
more
closely
at
these
performances
to
analyze
the
peculiarities
of
the
diction
to
dwell
at
some
length
on
the
sublime
wisdom
of
the
areopagitica
and
the
nervous
rhetoric
of
the
iconoclast
and
to
point
out
some
of
those
magnificent
passages
which
occur
in
the
treatise
of
reformation
and
the
animadversions
on
the
remonstrant
but
the
length
to
which
our
remarks
have
already
extended
renders
this
impossible
we
must
conclude
and
yet
we
can
scarcely
tear
ourselves
away
from
the
subject
the
days
immediately
following
the
publication
of
this
relic
of
milton
appear
to
be
peculiarly
set
apart
and
consecrated
to
his
memory
and
we
shall
scarcely
be
censured
if
on
this
his
festival
we
be
found
lingering
near
his
shrine
how
worthless
soever
may
be
the
offering
which
we
bring
to
it
while
this
book
lies
on
our
table
we
seem
to
be
contemporaries
of
the
writer
we
are
transported
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
back
we
can
almost
fancy
that
we
are
visiting
him
in
his
small
lodging
that
we
see
him
sitting
at
the
old
organ
beneath
the
faded
green
hangings
that
we
can
catch
the
quick
twinkle
of
his
eyes
rolling
in
vain
to
find
the
day
that
we
are
reading
in
the
lines
of
his
noble
countenance
the
proud
and
mournful
history
of
his
glory
and
his
affliction
we
imagine
to
ourselves
the
breathless
silence
in
which
we
should
listen
to
his
slightest
word
the
passionate
veneration
with
which
we
should
kneel
to
kiss
his
hand
and
weep
upon
it
the
earnestness
with
which
we
should
endeavor
to
console
him
if
indeed
such
a
spirit
could
need
consolation
for
the
neglect
of
an
age
unworthy
of
his
talents
and
his
virtues
the
eagerness
with
which
we
should
contest
with
his
daughters
or
with
his
quaker
friend
elwood
the
privilege
of
reading
homer
to
him
or
of
taking
down
the
immortal
accents
which
flowed
from
his
lips
these
are
perhaps
foolish
feelings
yet
we
can
not
be
ashamed
of
them
nor
shall
we
be
sorry
if
what
we
have
written
shall
in
any
degree
excite
them
in
other
minds
we
are
not
much
in
the
habit
of
idolizing
either
the
living
or
the
dead
and
we
think
that
there
is
no
more
certain
indication
of
a
weak
and
intellect
than
that
propensity
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
we
will
venture
to
christen
boswellism
but
there
are
a
few
characters
which
have
stood
the
closest
scrutiny
and
the
severest
tests
which
have
been
tried
in
the
furnace
and
have
proved
pure
which
have
been
weighed
in
the
balance
and
have
not
been
found
wanting
which
have
been
declared
sterling
by
the
general
consent
of
mankind
and
which
are
visibly
stamped
with
the
image
and
superscription
of
the
most
high
these
great
men
we
trust
that
we
know
how
to
prize
and
of
these
was
milton
the
sight
of
his
books
the
sound
of
his
name
are
pleasant
to
us
his
thoughts
resemble
those
celestial
fruits
and
flowers
which
the
virgin
martyr
of
massinger
sent
down
from
the
gardens
of
paradise
to
the
earth
and
which
were
distinguished
from
the
productions
of
other
soils
not
only
by
superior
bloom
and
sweetness
but
by
miraculous
efficacy
to
invigorate
and
to
heal
they
are
powerful
not
only
to
delight
but
to
elevate
and
purify
nor
do
we
envy
the
man
who
can
study
either
the
life
or
the
writings
of
the
great
poet
and
patriot
without
aspiring
to
emulate
not
indeed
the
sublime
works
with
which
his
genius
has
enriched
our
literature
but
the
zeal
with
which
he
labored
for
the
public
good
the
fortitude
with
which
he
endured
every
private
calamity
the
lofty
disdain
with
which
he
looked
down
on
temptations
and
dangers
the
deadly
hatred
which
he
bore
to
bigots
and
tyrants
and
the
faith
which
he
so
sternly
kept
with
his
country
and
with
his

of

not

for

proofs
of
the
existence
of
a
homer
identical
with
the
author
of

would
not
the

more
authentic

great
dramatist
of
goethe
we
know
more
i
mean
of
his
externals
than
of
any
other
writer
of
equal
note
this
is
due
in
part
to
his
wide
relations
official
and
other
with
his
contemporaries
to
his
large
correspondence
with
people
of
note
of
which
the
documents
have
been
preserved
by
the
parties
addressed
to
the
interest
felt
in
him
by
curious
observers
living
in
the
day
of
his
greatness
it
is
due
in
part
also
to
the
fact
that
unlike
the
greatest
of
his
predecessors
he
flourished
in
an
age
and
partly
it
is
due
to
autobiographical
notices
embracing
important
portions
of
his
history
two
seemingly
opposite
factors
limiting
and
qualifying
the
one
the
other
determined
the
course
and
topics
of
his
life
one
was
the
aim
which
he
proposed
to
himself
as
the

of
his
being
to
perfect
himself
to
make
the
most
of
the

had

a
constitutional

to
come

in

especially
in
natural

that
in
the

of

of

was

bent
on
guiding

in
strict

teased

the

in

youthful

who
blessed

with

and
possessed
uncommon

she
was
but
eighteen
when
wolfgang
was
born
a
companion
to
him
and
his
sister
cornelia
one
in
whom
they
were
sure
to
find
sympathy
and
ready
indulgence
goethe
was
indebted
to
her
as
he
tells

for
his
joyous
spirit
and
his

of
the

the
most

in

was
his

from
whom
he
had
his
name
johann
wolfgang
textor
the
or
chief
magistrate
of
the
city
from
him
goethe
seems
to
have
inherited
the
superstition
of
which
some
curious
examples
are
recorded
in
his
life
he
shared
with
napoleon
and
other
remarkable
men
says
von
müller
the
conceit
that
little
mischances
are
prophetic
of
greater
evils
on
a
journey
to
with
a
friend
his
carriage
was
upset
and
his
companion
slightly
injured
he
thought
it
a
bad
omen
and
instead
of
proceeding
to
chose
another
for
his
summer
resort
if
in
his
almanac
there
happened
to
be
a
blot
on
any
date
he
feared
to
undertake
anything
important
on
the
day
so
marked
he
had
noted
certain
fatal
days
one
of
these
was
the
of
march
on
that
day
he
had
lost
a
valued
friend
on
that
day
the
theatre
to
which
he
had
devoted
so
much
time
and
labor
was
burned
and
on
that
day
curiously
enough
he
died
he
believed
in
oracles
and
as
rousseau
threw
stones
at
a
tree
to
learn
whether
or
no
he
was
to
be
saved
the
hitting
or
not
hitting
the
tree
was
to
be
the
sign
so
goethe
tossed
a
valuable
into
the
river
lahn
to
ascertain
whether
he
would
succeed
as
a
painter
if
behind
the
bushes
which
bordered
the
stream
he
saw
the
knife
plunge
it
should
signify
success
if
not
he
would
take
it
as
an
omen
of
failure
rousseau
was
careful
he
tells
us
to
choose
a
stout
tree
and
to
stand
very
near
goethe
more
honest
with
himself
adopted
no
such
precaution
the
plunge
of
the
knife
was
not
seen
and
the
painter
career
was
abandoned
wordsworth
saying
the
child
is
the
father
of
the
man
a
saying
which
owes
its
vitality
more
to
its
form
than
its
substance
is
not
always
verified
or
its
truth
is
not
always
apparent
in
the
lives
of
distinguished
men
i
find
not
much
in
goethe
the
child
prophetic
of
goethe
the
man
but
the
singer
and
the
seeker
the
two
main
tendencies
of
his
being
are
already
apparent
in
early
life
of
moral
traits
the
most
conspicuous
in
the
child
is
a
power
of
a
moral
heroism
which
secured
to
him
in
after
life
a
natural
leadership
unattainable
by
mere
intellectual
supremacy
an
instance
of
this
is
recorded
among
the
anecdotes
of
his
boyhood
at
one
of
the
lessons
which
he
shared
with
other
boys
the
teacher
failed
to
appear
the
young
people
awaited
his
coming
for
a
while
but
toward
the
close
of
the
hour
most
of
them
departed
leaving
behind
three
who
were
especially
hostile
to
goethe
these
he
says
thought
to
torment
to
mortify
and
to
drive
me
away
they
left
me
a
moment
and
returned
with
rods
taken
from
a
broom
which
they
had
cut
to
pieces
i
perceived
their
intention
and
supposing
the
expiration
of
the
hour
to
be
near
i
immediately
determined
to
make
no
resistance
until
the
clock
should
strike
unmercifully
thereupon
they
began
to
scourge
in
the
cruellest
manner
my
legs
and
calves
i
did
not
stir
but
soon
felt
that
i
had
miscalculated
the
time
and
that
such
pain
greatly
lengthens
the
minutes
when
the
hour
expired
his
superior
activity
enabled
him
to
master
all
three
and
to
pin
them
to
the
ground
in
later
years
the
same
zeal
of
which
prompted
the
child
to
exercise
himself
in
bearing
pain
impelled
the
man
to
resist
and
overcome
constitutional
weaknesses
by
force
of
will
a
student
of
architecture
he
conquered
a
tendency
to
giddiness
by
standing
on
pinnacles
and
walking
on
narrow
rafters
over
perilous
abysses
in
like
manner
he
overcame
the
ghostly
terrors
instilled
in
the
nursery
by
midnight
visits
to
churchyards
and
uncanny
places
to
real
peril
to
fear
of
death
he
seems
to
have
had
that
native
insensibility
so
notable
always
in
men
of
genius
in
whom
the
conviction
of
a
higher
destiny
begets
the
feeling
of
a
charmed
life
such
as
plutarch
records
of
the
first
caesar
in
peril
of
shipwreck
on
the
river
anio
in
the
french
campaign
in
which
goethe
accompanied
the
duke
of
weimar
against
the
armies
of
the
republic
a
sudden
impulse
of
scientific
curiosity
prompted
him
in
spite
of
warnings
and
remonstrances
to
experiment
on
what
is
called
the
for
this
purpose
he
rode
to
a
place
in
which
he
was
exposed
to
a
of
the
two
armies
and
coolly
watched
the
sensations
experienced
in
that
place
of
peril
command
of
himself
acquired
by
long
and
systematic
discipline
gave
him
that
command
over
others
which
he
exercised
in
several
memorable
instances
coming
from
a
ball
one
night
a
young
man
fresh
from
the
university
he
saw
that
a
fire
had
broken
out
in
the
judengasse
and
that
people
were
standing
about
helpless
and
confused
without
a
leader
he
immediately
jumped
from
his
carriage
and
full
dressed
as
he
was
in
silk
stockings
and
pumps
organized
on
the
spot
a
which
averted
a
dangerous
conflagration
on
another
occasion
voyaging
in
the
mediterranean
he
quelled
a
mutiny
on
board
an
italian
ship
when
captain
and
mates
were
powerless
and
the
vessel
drifting
on
the
rocks
by
commanding
sailors
and
passengers
to
fall
on
their
knees
and
pray
to
the
virgin
adopting
the
idiom
of
their
religion
as
well
as
their
speech
of
which
he
was
a
master
as
a
student
first
at
leipsic
then
at
strasburg
including
the
years
from
to
he
seems
not
to
have
been
a
very
diligent
attendant
on
the
lectures
in
either
university
and
to
have
profited
little
by
professional
instruction
in
compliance
with
the
wishes
of
his
father
who
intended
him
for
a
jurist
he
gave
some
time
to
the
study
of
the
law
but
on
the
whole
the
principal
gain
of
those
years
was
derived
from
intercourse
with
distinguished
intellectual
men
and
women
whose
acquaintance
he
cultivated
and
the
large
opportunities
of
social
life
in
strasburg
occurred
the
famous
with
friederike
brion
which
terminated
so
unhappily
at
the
time
and
so
fortunately
in
the
end
for
both
goethe
has
been
blamed
for
not
marrying
friederike
his
real
blame
consists
in
the
heedlessness
with
which
in
the
beginning
of
their
acquaintance
he
surrendered
himself
to
the
charm
of
her
presence
thereby
engaging
her
affection
without
a
thought
of
the
consequences
to
either
besides
the
disillusion
which
showed
him
when
he
came
fairly
to
face
the
question
that
he
did
not
love
her
sufficiently
to
justify
marriage
there
were
circumstances
material
economical
which
made
it
practically
impossible
her
suffering
in
the
separation
great
as
it
was
so
great
indeed
as
to
cause
a
dangerous
attack
of
bodily
disease
could
not
outweigh
the
pangs
which
he
endured
in
his
penitent
contemplation
of
the
consequences
of
his
folly
the
next
five
years
were
spent
partly
in
frankfort
and
partly
in
wetzlar
partly
in
the
forced
exercise
of
his
profession
but
chiefly
in
literary
labors
and
the
use
of
the
pencil
which
for
a
time
disputed
with
the
pen
the
devotion
of
the
they
may
be
regarded
as
perhaps
the
most
fruitful
certainly
the
most
growing
years
of
his
life
they
gave
birth
to
götz
von
berlichingen
and
the
sorrows
of
werther
to
the
first
inception
of
faust
and
to
many
of
his
sweetest
lyrics
it
was
during
this
period
that
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
charlotte
buff
the
heroine
of
the
sorrows
of
werther
from
whom
he
finally
tore
himself
away
leaving
wetzlar
when
he
discovered
that
their
growing
interest
in
each
other
was
endangering
her
relation
with
kestner
her
betrothed
in
those
years
also
he
formed
a
matrimonial
engagement
with
elizabeth
schönemann
lili
the
rupture
of
which
i
must
think
was
a
real
misfortune
for
the
poet
it
came
about
by
no
fault
of
his
her
family
had
from
the
first
opposed
themselves
to
the
match
on
the
ground
of
social
disparity
for
even
in
mercantile
frankfort
rank
was
strongly
marked
and
the
goethes
though
respectable
people
were
beneath
the
schönemanns
in
the
social
scale
genius
went
for
nothing
with
madame
schönemann
she
wanted
for
her
daughter
an
aristocratic
husband
not
a
literary
one
one
who
had
wealth
in
possession
and
not
merely
as
goethe
had
in
prospect
how
far
lili
was
influenced
by
her
mother
and
brother
representations
it
is
impossible
to
say
however
she
showed
herself
capricious
was
sometimes
cold
or
seemed
so
to
him
while
favoring
the
advances
of
others
goethe
was
convinced
that
she
did
not
entertain
for
him
that
devoted
love
without
which
he
felt
that
their
union
could
not
be
a
happy
one
they
separated
but
on
her
she
confessed
to
a
friend
that
all
she
was
intellectually
and
morally
she
owed
to
him
in
our
poet
was
invited
by
the
young
duke
of
karl
august
whose
acquaintance
he
had
made
at
frankfort
and
at
mentz
his
junior
by
two
or
three
years
to
establish
himself
in
civil
service
at
the
court

father
who
had
other
views
for
his
son
and
was
not
much
inclined
to
trust
in
princes
objected
many
wondered
some
blamed
goethe
himself
appears
to
have
wavered
with
painful
indecision
and
at
last
to
have
followed
a
mysterious
impulse
rather
than
a
clear
conviction
or
deliberate
choice
his
heidelberg
friend
and
hostess
sought
still
to
detain
him
when
the
last
express
from
weimar
drove
up
to
the
door
to
her
he
replied
in
the
words
of
his
own
egmont
say
no
more
goaded
by
invisible
spirits
the
of
time
run
away
with
the
light
chariot
of
our
destiny
there
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
keep
our
courage
hold
tight
the
reins
and
guide
the
wheels
now
right
now
left
avoiding
a
stone
here
a
fall
there
whither
away
who
knows
scarcely
one
remembers
whence
he
came
it
does
not
appear
that
he
ever
repented
this
most
decisive
step
of
his
nor
does
there
appear
to
have
been
any
reason
why
he
should
a
position
an
office
of
some
kind
he
needs
must
have
even
now
the
life
of
a
writer
by
profession
with
no
function
but
that
of
literary
composition
is
seldom
a
prosperous
one
in
goethe
day
when
literature
was
far
less
remunerative
than
it
is
in
ours
it
was
seldom
practicable
unless
he
had
chosen
to
be
maintained
by
his
father
some
employment
besides
that
of
was
an
imperative
necessity
the
alternative
of
that
which
was
offered
the
one
his
father
would
have
chosen
was
that
of
a
plodding
jurist
in
a
country
where
forensic
pleading
was
unknown
and
where
the
lawyer
profession
offered
no
scope
for
any
of
the
higher
talents
with
which
goethe
was
endowed
on
the
whole
it
was
a
happy
chance
that
called
him
to
the
little
capital
of
the
little
of
if
the
state
was
one
of
petty
dimensions
a
kind
of
like
so
many
of
the
principalities
of
germany
it
nevertheless
included
some
of
the
fairest
localities
and
one
at
least
of
the
most
memorable
in
europe
the
wartburg
where
luther
translated
the
bible
where
saint
elizabeth
dispensed
the
blessings
of
her
life
where
the
minnesingers
are
said
to
have
held
their
poetic
tournament
heinrich
von
ofterdingen
wolfram
von
eschenbach
it
included
also
the
university
of
jena
which
at
that
time
numbered
some
of
the
foremost
men
of
germany
among
its
professors
it
was
a
miniature
state
and
a
miniature
town
one
wonders
that
goethe
who
would
have
shone
the
foremost
star
in
berlin
or
vienna
could
content
himself
with
so
narrow
a
field
but
vienna
and
berlin
did
not
call
him
until
it
was
too
late
until
patronage
was
needless
and
weimar
did
a
miniature
state
but
so
much
the
greater
his
power
and
freedom
and
the
opportunity
of
beneficent
action
no
prince
was
ever
more
concerned
to
promote
in
every
way
the
welfare
of
his
subjects
than
karl
august
and
in
all
his
works
undertaken
for
this
purpose
goethe
was
his
foremost
counsellor
and
aid
the
most
important
were
either
suggested
by
him
or
executed
under
his
direction
had
he
never
written
a
poem
or
given
to
the
world
a
single
literary
composition
he
would
still
have
led
as
a
weimar
official
a
useful
and
beneficent
life
but
the
knowledge
of
the
world
and
of
business
the
social
and
other
experience
gained
in
this
way
was
precisely
the
training
which
he
needed
and
which
every
poet
needs
for
the
broadening
and
deepening
and
perfection
of
his
art
friedrich
von
müller
in
his
valuable
treatise
of
goethe
as
a
man
of
affairs
tells
us
how
he
traversed
every
portion
of
the
country
to
learn
what
advantage
might
be
taken
of
topographical
peculiarities
what
provision
made
for
local
necessities
everywhere
on
hilltops
crowned
with
primeval
forests
in
the
depths
of
gorges
and
shafts
nature
met
her
favorite
with
friendly
advances
and
revealed
to
him
many
a
desired
secret
whatever
was
privately
gained
in
this
way
was
applied
to
public
uses
he
endeavored
to
infuse
new
life
into
the
mining
business
and
to
make
himself
familiar
with
all
its
technical
requirements
for
that
end
he
revived
his
chemical
experiments
new
roads
were
built
hydraulic
operations
were
conducted
on
more
scientific
principles
fertile
meadows
were
won
from
the
river
saale
by
systematic
drainage
and
in
many
a
struggle
with
nature
an
intelligently
persistent
will
obtained
the
victory
nor
was
it
with
material
obstacles
only
that
the
had
to
contend
in
the
exercise
of
the
powers
intrusted
to
him
he
often
encountered
the
fierce
opposition
of
party
interest
and
stubborn
prejudice
and
was
sometimes
driven
to
heroic
and
despotic
measures
in
order
to
accomplish
a
desired
result
as
when
he
foiled
the
machinations
of
the
jena
professors
in
his
determination
to
save
the
university
library
and
when
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
the
leading
burghers
he
demolished
the
city
wall
in
goethe
was
enabled
to
realize
his
cherished
dream
of
a
journey
to
italy
there
he
spent
a
year
and
a
half
in
the
diligent
study
and
admiring
enjoyment
of
the
treasures
of
art
which
made
that
country
then
even
more
than
now
the
mark
and
desire
of
the
civilized
world
he
came
back
an
altered
man
intellectually
and
morally
he
had
made
in
that
brief
space
under
new
influences
a
prodigious
stride
his
sudden
advance
while
they
had
remained
stationary
separated
him
from
his
contemporaries
the
old
associations
of
the
weimar
world
which
still
revolved
its
little
round
the
traveller
had
outgrown
people
thought
him
cold
and
reserved
it
was
only
that
the
gay
impulsive
youth
had
ripened
into
an
earnest
sedate
man
he
found
germany
jubilant
over
schiller
robbers
and
other
writings
representative
of
the
school
which
his
maturity
had
left
far
behind
his
own
contributions
to
which
he
had
come
to
hate
schiller
who
first
made
his
acquaintance
at
this
time
writes
to
körner
i
doubt
that
we
shall
ever
become
intimate
much
that
to
me
is
still
of
great
interest
he
has
already
outlived
he
is
so
far
beyond
me
not
so
much
in
years
as
in
experience
and
culture
that
we
can
never
come
together
in
one
course
how
greatly
schiller
erred
in
the
supposition
that
they
never
could
become
intimate
how
close
the
intimacy
which
grew
up
between
them
what
harmony
of
sentiment
how
friendly
and
mutually
helpful
their
is
sufficiently
notorious
but
such
was
the
first
aspect
which
goethe
presented
to
strangers
at
this
period
of
his
life
he
rather
repelled
than
attracted
until
nearer
acquaintance
learned
rightly
to
interpret
the
man
and
intellectual
or
moral
affinity
bridged
the
chasm
which
seemed
to
divide
him
from
his
kind
in
part
too
the
distance
and
reserve
of
which
people
complained
was
a
necessary
measure
of
against
the
disturbing
importunities
of
social
life
from
rome
says
friedrich
von
müller
from
the
midst
of
the
richest
and
grandest
life
dates
the
stern
maxim
of
which
governed
his
subsequent
being
and
doing
and
which
furnished
his
only
guarantee
of
mental
equipoise
and
peace
his
literary
works
hitherto
had
been
spasmodic
and
lawless
effusions
the
escapes
of
a
gushing
turbulent
youth
in
rome
he
had
learned
the
sacred
significance
of
art
the
consciousness
of
his
true
vocation
had
been
awakened
in
him
and
to
that
on
the
eve
of
his
fortieth
year
he
thenceforth
solemnly
devoted
the
remainder
of
his
life
he
obtained
release
from
the
more
onerous
of
his
official
engagements
retaining
only
such
functions
as
accorded
with
his
proper
calling
as
a
man
of
letters
and
of
science
he
renounced
his
daily
intercourse
with
frau
von
stein
though
still
retaining
and
manifesting
his
unabated
friendship
for
the
woman
to
whom
in
former
years
he
had
devoted
so
large
a
portion
of
his
time
and
employed
himself
in
giving
forth
those
immortal
words
which
have
settled
forever
his
place
among
the
stars
of
first
magnitude
in
the
intellectual
world
noticeable
and
often
noted
was
the
charm
and
when
arrived
to
maturity
the
grand
effect
of
his
personal
presence
physical
beauty
is
not
the
stated
accompaniment
nor
even
the
presumable
adjunct
of
intellectual
greatness
in
goethe
as
perhaps
in
no
other
the
two
were
combined
a
wondrous
presence
on
this
point
the
voices
are
one
and
the
witnesses
many
goethe
was
with
us
so
writes
heinse
to
one
of
his
friends
a
beautiful
youth
of
full
of
genius
and
force
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
a
heart
full
of
feeling
a
spirit
full
of
fire
who
with
eagle
wings
immensus
ore
jacobi
writes
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
impossible
it
seems
to
me
to
communicate
to
any
one
who
has
not
seen
goethe
any
conception
of
this
extraordinary
creature
of
god
lavater
says
unspeakably
sweet
an
indescribable
appearance
the
most
terrible
and
lovable
of
men
hufeland
the
chief
medical
celebrity
of
germany
describes
his
appearance
in
early
manhood
never
shall
i
forget
the
impression
which
he
made
as
in
greek
costume
you
thought
you
beheld
an
apollo
never
was
seen
in
any
man
such
union
of
physical
and
spiritual
perfection
and
beauty
as
at
that
time
in
goethe
more
remarkable
still
is
the
testimony
of
wieland
who
had
reason
to
be
offended
having
been
before
their
acquaintance
the
subject
of
goethe
sharp
satire
but
immediately
at
their
first
meeting
sitting
at
table
by
the
side
he
says
of
this
glorious
youth
i
was
radically
cured
of
all
my
vexation
since
this
morning
he
wrote
to
jacobi
my
soul
is
as
full
of
goethe
as
a
dewdrop
is
of
the
morning
sun
and
to
zimmermann
he
is
in
every
respect
the
greatest
best
most
splendid
human
being
that
ever
god
created
goethe
was
then
henry
crabbe
robinson
who
saw
him
at
the
age
of
reports
him
one
of
the
most
oppressively
handsome
men
he
had
ever
seen
and
speaks
particularly
as
all
who
have
described
him
speak
of
his
wonderfully
brilliant
eyes
those
eyes
we
are
told
had
lost
nothing
of
their
lustre
nor
his
head
its
natural
covering
at
the
age
of
eighty
among
the
heroic
qualities
notable
in
goethe
i
reckon
his
faithful
and
unflagging
industry
here
was
a
man
who
took
pains
with
himself
sich
sauer
werden
and
made
the
most
of
himself
he
speaks
of
wasting
while
a
student
in
leipsic
the
beautiful
time
and
certainly
neither
at
leipsic
nor
afterward
at
strasburg
did
he
toil
as
his
wagner
in
faust
would
have
done
but
he
was
always
learning
in
the
or
out
of
it
with
pen
and
books
or
gay
companions
he
was
taking
in
to
give
forth
again
in
dramatic
or
philosophic
form
the
world
of
his
experience
a
frolicsome
youth
may
leave
something
to
regret
in
the
way
of
time
misspent
but
goethe
the
man
was
no
dawdler
no
epicurean
on
the
whole
he
made
the
most
of
himself
and
stands
before
the
world
a
notable
instance
of
a
complete
life
he
would
do
the
work
which
was
given
him
to
do
he
would
not
die
till
the
second
part
of
faust
was
brought
to
its
predetermined
close
by
sheer
force
of
will
he
lived
till
that
work
was
done
smitten
at
fourscore
by
the
death
of
his
son
and
by
deaths
all
around
he
kept
to
his
task
the
idea
of
duty
alone
sustains
me
the
spirit
is
willing
the
flesh
must
when
faust
was
finished
the
strain
relaxed
my
remaining
days
he
said
i
may
consider
a
free
gift
it
matters
little
what
i
do
now
or
whether
i
do
anything
and
six
months
later
he
died
a
complete
life
a
life
of
strenuous
toil
at
home
and
abroad
in
italy
and
sicily
at
ilmenau
and
carlsbad
as
in
his
study
at
weimar
with
eye
or
pen
or
speech
he
was
always
at
work
a
man
of
rigid
habits
no
lolling
or
lounging
he
showed
me
says
eckermann
an
elegant
which
he
had
bought
at
auction
said
he
shall
never
or
rarely
use
it
all
indolent
habits
are
against
my
nature
you
see
in
my
chamber
no
sofa
i
sit
always
in
my
old
wooden
chair
and
never
till
a
few
weeks
ago
have
permitted
even
a
leaning
place
for
my
head
to
be
added
if
surrounded
by
tasteful
furniture
my
thoughts
are
arrested
i
am
placed
in
an
agreeable
but
passive
state
unless
we
are
accustomed
to
them
from
early
youth
splendid
chambers
and
elegant
furniture
had
better
be
left
to
people
without
thoughts
this
in
his
year
a
widely
diffused
prejudice
regarding
the
personal
character
of
goethe
refuses
to
credit
him
with
any
moral
worth
accordant
with
his
bodily
and
mental
gifts
it
figures
him
a
libertine
heartless
loveless
bad
i
do
not
envy
the
mental
condition
of
those
who
can
rest
in
the
belief
that
a
really
great
poet
can
be
a
bad
man
be
assured
that
the
fruits
of
genius
have
never
grown
and
will
never
grow
in
such
a
soil
of
all
great
poets
byron
might
seem
at
first
glance
to
constitute
an
exception
to
this
i
venture
to
call
it
law
of
nature
yet
hear
what
walter
scott
a
sufficient
judge
said
of
byron
the
errors
of
lord
byron
arose
neither
from
depravity
of
heart
for
nature
had
not
committed
the
anomaly
of
uniting
to
such
extraordinary
talents
an
imperfect
moral
sense
nor
from
feelings
dead
to
the
admiration
of
virtue
no
man
had
ever
a
kinder
heart
for
sympathy
or
a
more
open
hand
for
the
relief
of
distress
and
no
mind
was
ever
more
formed
for
enthusiastic
admiration
of
noble
actions
the
case
of
goethe
requires
no
appeal
to
general
principles
it
only
requires
that
the
charges
against
him
be
fairly
investigated
that
he
be
tried
by
documentary
evidence
and
by
the
testimony
of
competent
witnesses
the
mistake
is
made
of
confusing
breaches
of
conventional
decorum
with
essential
depravity
that
goethe
was
faulty
in
many
ways
may
be
freely
conceded
but
surely
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
not
being
faultless
and
being
definitely
bad
to
call
a
man
bad
is
to
say
that
the
evil
in
him
preponderates
over
the
good
in
the
case
of
goethe
the
balance
was
greatly
the
other
way
it
has
been
said
that
he
abused
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
by
women
that
he
encouraged
affection
which
he
did
not
reciprocate
for
artistic
purposes
the
charge
is
utterly
groundless
and
in
the
case
of
bettine
has
been
refuted
by
irrefragable
proof
to
say
that
he
was
wanting
in
love
heartless
cold
is
ridiculously
false
yet
the
charge
is
constantly
reiterated
in
the
face
of
facts
reiterated
with
undoubting
assurance
and
a
certain
complacency
which
seems
to
say
thank
god
we
are
not
as
this
man
was
there
is
a
satisfaction
which
some
people
feel
in
their
man
burns
drank
coleridge
took
opium
byron
was
a
rake
goethe
was
cold
by
these
marks
we
know
them
the
poet
found
it
necessary
as
i
have
said
in
later
years
under
social
pressure
for
the
sake
of
the
work
which
was
given
him
to
do
to
fortify
himself
with
a
mail
of
reserve
and
this
indeed
contrasted
strangely
with
his
former
and
with
the
customary
gush
of
german
sentimentality
it
was
common
then
for
germans
who
had
known
each
other
by
report
and
were
mutually
attracted
when
first
they
met
to
fall
on
each
other
necks
and
kiss
and
weep
goethe
as
a
young
man
had
indulged
such
fervors
but
in
old
age
he
had
lost
this
effusiveness
or
saw
fit
to
restrain
himself
outwardly
while
his
kindly
nature
still
glowed
with
its
pristine
fires
he
wrote
to
frau
von
stein
i
may
truly
say
that
my
innermost
condition
does
not
correspond
to
my
outward
behavior
hence
the
charge
of
coldness
say
that
mount
aetna
is
cold
do
we
not
see
the
snow
on
its
sides
but
he
was
unpatriotic
he
occupied
himself
with
poetry
and
did
not
cry
out
while
his
country
was
in
the
so
it
seemed
of
the
struggle
with
france
but
what
should
he
have
done
what
he
have
done
what
would
his
single
arm
or
declamation
have
availed
no
man
more
than
goethe
longed
for
the
rehabilitation
of
germany
in
his
own
way
he
wrought
for
that
end
he
could
work
effectually
in
no
other
that
enigmatical
composition
the
märchen
according
to
the
latest
interpretation
indicates
how
in
goethe
view
that
end
was
to
be
accomplished
to
one
who
considers
the
relation
of
ideas
to
events
it
will
not
seem
extravagant
when
i
say
that
to
goethe
more
than
to
any
one
individual
germany
is
indebted
for
her
emancipation
independence
and
present
political
regeneration
footnote
the
following
interpretation
of
the
märchen
is
condensed
from
a
later
portion
of
this
essay
and
used
here
as
a
for
the
light
it
throws
upon
goethe
political
career
in
the
summer
of
goethe
composed
for
schiller
new
magazine
die
horen
a
prose
poem
known
in
german
literature
as
märchen
tale
as
if
it
were
the
only
one
or
the
one
which
more
than
another
deserves
that
appellation
goethe
gave
this
essay
to
the
public
as
a
riddle
which
would
probably
be
unintelligible
at
the
time
but
which
might
perhaps
find
an
interpreter
after
many
days
when
the
hints
contained
in
it
should
be
verified
since
its
first
appearance
commentators
have
exercised
their
ingenuity
upon
it
perceiving
it
to
be
allegorical
but
until
recently
without
success
i
follow
herman
baumgart
lead
in
the
exposition
which
i
now
offer
the
tale
is
a
prophetic
vision
of
the
destinies
of
germany
an
allegorical
foreshowing
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
of
what
germany
was
yet
to
become
and
has
in
great
part
already
become
a
position
is
predicted
for
her
like
that
which
she
occupied
from
the
time
of
charles
the
great
to
the
time
of
charles
a
period
during
which
the
holy
roman
empire
of
germany
was
the
leading
secular
power
in
western
europe
that
time
had
gone
by
since
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
germany
had
declined
and
at
the
date
of
this
writing
had
nearly
reached
her
darkest
day
disintegrated
torn
by
conflicting
interests
pecked
by
petty
rival
princes
despairing
of
her
own
future
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
should
ever
again
become
a
power
among
the
nations
goethe
felt
this
he
felt
it
as
profoundly
as
any
german
of
his
day
and
he
characteristically
went
into
himself
and
studied
the
situation
the
result
was
this
wonderful
composition
das
märchen
he
perceived
that
germany
must
die
to
be
born
again
she
did
die
and
is
born
again
he
had
the
sagacity
to
foresee
the
dissolution
of
the
holy
roman
empire
an
event
which
took
place
eleven
years
later
in
the
empire
is
figured
by
the
composite
statue
of
the
fourth
king
in
the
subterranean
temple
which
crumbles
to
pieces
when
that
temple
representing
germany
past
emerges
and
stands
above
ground
by
the
river
the
resurrection
of
the
temple
and
its
stand
by
the
river
is
the
of
the
tale
and
that
signifies
allegorically
the
rehabilitation
of
germany
it
is
true
his
writings
contain
no
declamations
against
tyrants
and
no
tirades
in
favor
of
liberty
he
believed
that
oppression
existed
only
through
ignorance
and
blindness
and
these
he
was
all
his
life
long
seeking
to
remove
he
believed
that
true
liberty
is
attainable
only
through
mental
illumination
and
that
he
was
all
his
life
long
seeking
to
promote
he
was
no
agitator
no
revolutionist
he
had
no
faith
in
violent
measures
human
welfare
he
judged
is
not
to
be
advanced
in
that
way
is
less
dependent
on
forms
of
polity
than
on
the
life
within
but
if
the
test
of
patriotism
is
the
service
rendered
to
one
country
who
more
patriotic
than
he
lucky
for
us
and
the
world
that
he
persisted
to
serve
her
in
his
own
way
and
not
as
the
agitators
claimed
that
he
should
it
was
clear
to
him
then
and
must
be
clear
to
us
now
that
he
could
not
have
been
what
they
demanded
and
at
the
same
time
have
given
to
his
country
and
the
world
what
he
did
as
a
courtier
and
favorite
of
fortune
it
was
inevitable
that
goethe
should
have
enemies
they
have
done
what
they
could
to
blacken
his
name
and
to
this
day
the
shadow
they
have
cast
upon
it
in
part
remains
but
of
this
be
sure
that
no
selfish
loveless
egoist
could
have
had
and
retained
such
friends
the
man
whom
the
saintly
fraulein
von
klettenberg
chose
for
her
friend
whom
herder
declared
that
he
loved
as
he
did
his
own
soul
the
man
whose
thoughtful
kindness
is
celebrated
by
herder
incomparable
wife
whom
karl
august
and
the
duchess
luise
cherished
as
a
brother
the
man
whom
children
everywhere
welcomed
as
their
ready
playfellow
and
sure
ally
of
whom
pious
jung
stilling
lamented
that
admirers
of
goethe
genius
knew
so
little
of
the
goodness
of
his
heart
can
this
have
been
a
bad
man
heartless
cold
ii
the
writer
i
have
said
that
to
goethe
above
all
writers
belongs
the
distinction
of
having
excelled
not
experimented
merely
that
others
have
also
done
but
excelled
in
many
distinct
kinds
to
the
lyrist
he
added
the
dramatist
to
the
dramatist
the
novelist
to
the
novelist
the
mystic
seer
and
to
all
these
the
naturalist
and
scientific
discoverer
the
history
of
literature
exhibits
no
other
instance
in
which
a
great
poet
has
supplemented
his
proper
orbit
with
so
wide
an
epicyle
in
poetry
as
in
science
the
ground
of
his
activity
was
a
passionate
love
of
nature
which
dates
from
his
boyhood
at
the
age
of
fifteen
recovering
from
a
sickness
caused
by
disappointment
in
a
boyish
affair
of
the
heart
he
betook
himself
with
his
to
the
woods
in
the
farthest
depth
of
the
forest
he
says
i
sought
out
a
solemn
spot
where
ancient
oaks
and
beeches
formed
a
shady
retreat
a
slight
declivity
of
the
soil
made
the
merit
of
the
ancient
boles
more
conspicuous
this
space
was
inclosed
by
a
thicket
of
bushes
between
which
peeped
rocks
mighty
and
venerable
affording
a
rapid
fall
to
an
affluent
brook
the
sketches
made
of
these
objects
at
that
early
age
could
have
had
no
artistic
value
although
the
methodical
father
was
careful
to
mount
and
preserve
them
but
what
the
pencil
had
it
been
the
pencil
of
the
greatest
master
could
never
glean
from
scenes
like
these
what
art
could
never
grasp
what
words
can
never
formulate
the
heart
of
the
boy
then
imbibed
assimilated
resolved
in
his
innermost
being
there
awoke
in
him
then
those
mysterious
feelings
those
unutterable
yearnings
that
pensive
joy
in
the
contemplation
of
nature
which
leavened
all
his
subsequent
life
and
the
influence
of
which
is
so
perceptible
in
his
poetry
especially
in
his
lyrics
the
first
literary
venture
by
which
goethe
became
widely
known
was
götz
von
berlichingen
a
dramatic
picture
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
which
the
principal
figure
is
a
predatory
noble
of
that
name
a
dramatic
picture
but
not
in
any
true
sense
a
play
it
owed
its
popularity
at
the
time
partly
to
the
truth
of
its
portraitures
partly
to
its
choice
of
a
native
subject
and
the
truly
german
feeling
which
pervades
it
it
was
a
new
departure
in
german
literature
and
perplexed
the
critics
as
much
as
it
delighted
the
general
public
it
anticipated
by
a
quarter
of
a
century
what
is
technically
called
the
romantic
school
götz
von
berlichingen
was
soon
followed
by
the
sorrows
of
werther
one
of
those
books
which
on
their
first
appearance
have
taken
the
world
by
storm
and
of
which
stowe
uncle
tom
cabin
is
the
latest
example
it
is
a
curious
circumstance
that
a
great
poet
should
have
won
his
first
laurels
by
prose
composition
sir
walter
scott
eclipsed
the
splendor
of
his
poems
by
the
popularity
of
the
waverley
novels
goethe
eclipsed
the
popularity
of
his
werther
by
the
splendor
of
his
poems
of
one
who
was
great
in
so
many
kinds
it
may
seem
difficult
to
decide
in
what
department
he
most
excelled
without
undertaking
to
measure
and
compare
what
is
incommensurable
i
hold
that
goethe
genius
is
essentially
lyrical
whatever
else
may
be
claimed
for
him
he
is
first
of
all
and
chiefly
a
singer
deepest
in
his
nature
the
most
innate
of
all
his
faculties
was
the
faculty
of
song
of
rhythmical
utterance
the
first
to
manifest
itself
in
childhood
it
was
still
active
at
the
age
of
fourscore
the
lyrical
portions
of
the
second
part
of
faust
some
of
which
were
written
a
short
time
before
his
death
are
as
spirited
the
versification
as
easy
the
rhythm
as
perfect
as
the
songs
of
his
youth
as
a
lyrist
he
is
unsurpassed
i
venture
to
say
unequalled
if
we
take
into
view
the
whole
wide
range
of
his
performance
in
this
kind
from
the
ballads
the
of
his
smaller
poems
and
those
light
fugitive
pieces
those
bursts
of
song
which
came
to
him
without
effort
and
with
such
a
rush
that
in
order
to
arrest
and
preserve
them
he
seized
as
he
tells
us
the
first
scrap
of
paper
that
came
to
hand
and
wrote
upon
it
diagonally
if
it
happened
so
to
lie
on
his
table
lest
through
the
delay
of
selecting
and
placing
the
inspiration
should
be
checked
and
the
poem
evaporate
from
these
to
such
stately
compositions
as
the
zueignung
or
dedication
of
his
poems
the
weltseele
and
the
orphic
sayings
in
short
from
poetry
that
writes
itself
that
springs
spontaneously
in
the
mind
to
poetry
that
is
written
with
elaborate
art
there
is
this
distinction
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
marked
in
lyric
verse
compare
in
english
poetry
by
way
of
illustration
the
snatches
of
song
in
shakspeare
plays

shakspeare
sonnets

goethe
ballads
have
an
undying
popularity
they
have
been
translated
and
most
of
them
are
familiar
to
english
readers
in
the
elegies
written
after
his
return
from
italy
the
author
figures
as
a
classic
poet
inspired
by
the
latin
muse
the
choicest
of
these
elegies
the
alexis
and
dora
is
not
so
much
an
imitation
of
the
ancients
as
it
is
the
manifestation
of
a
side
of
the
poet
nature
which
he
had
in
common
with
the
ancients
he
wrote
as
a
greek
or
roman
might
write
because
he
felt
his
subject
as
a
greek
or
roman
might
feel
it
hermann
und
dorothea
which
schiller
pronounced
the
acme
not
only
of
goethean
but
of
all
modern
art
was
written
professedly
as
an
attempt
in
the
homeric
style
motived
by
wolf
prolegomena
and
luise
it
is
homeric
only
in
its
circumstantiality
in
the
repetition
of
the
same
epithets
applied
to
the
same
persons
and
in
the
greek
realism
of

footnote
from

this
exquisite

has
been
translated
into

hexameters
with
great
fidelity
by
miss
ellen
frothingham
iphigenie
auf
tauris
handles
a
greek
theme
exhibits
greek
characters
and
was
hailed
on
its
first
appearance
as
a
genuine
echo
of
the
greek
drama
lewes
denies
it
that
character
and
certainly
it
is
not
greek
but
christian
in
sentiment
it
differs
from
the
extant
drama
of
euripides
who
treats
the
same
subject
in
the
christian
feeling
which
determines
its
a
large
portion
of
goethe
productions
have
taken
the
dramatic
form
yet
he
can
not
be
said
theatrically
speaking
to
have
been
like
schiller
a
successful
dramatist
his
plays
with
the
exception
of
egmont
and
the
first
part
of
faust
have
not
commanded
the
stage
they
form
no
part
i
believe
of
the
stock
of
any
german
theatre
the
characterizations
are
striking
but
the
positions
are
not
dramatic
single
scenes
in
some
of
them
are
exceptions
like
that
in
egmont
where
clara
endeavors
to
rouse
her
to
the
rescue
of
the
count
while
brackenburg
seeks
to
restrain
her
and
several
of
the
scenes
in
the
first
part
of
faust
but
on
the
whole
the
interest
of
goethe
dramas
is
psychological
rather
than
scenic
especially
is
this
the
case
with
tasso
one
of
the
author
noblest
works
where
the
characters
are
not
so
much
actors
as
metaphysical
portraitures
schiller
in
his
plays
had
always
the
stage
in
view
goethe
on
the
contrary
wrote
for
readers
or
cultivated
reflective
hearers
not
spectators
when
i
say
then
that
goethe
compared
with
schiller
failed
of
dramatic
success
i
mean
that
his
talent
did
not
lie
in
the
line
of
plays
adapted
to
the
stage
as
it
is
or
if
the
talent
was
not
wanting
his
taste
did
not
incline
to
such
performance
he
was
no
playwright
but
there
is
another
and
higher
sense
of
the
word
where
goethe
is
supreme
the
sense
in
which
dante
great
poem
is
called
a
play
there
is
a
drama
whose
scope
is
beyond
the
compass
of
any
earthly
stage
a
drama
not
for
to
be
seen
on
the
boards
but
for
intellectual
contemplation
of
men
and
angels
such
a
drama
is
faust
of
which
i
shall
speak
hereafter
of
goethe
prose
works
i
mean
works
of
prose
fiction
the
most
considerable
are
two
philosophical
novels
wilhelm
meister
and
the
elective
affinities
in
the
first
of
these
the
various
and
complex
motives
which
have
shaped
the
composition
may
be
comprehended
in
the
one
word
the
education
of
life
for
the
business
of
life
the
main
thread
of
the
narrative
traces
through
a
labyrinth
of
loosely
connected
scenes
and
events
the
growth
of
the
hero
character
a
progressive
training
by
various
influences
passional
intellectual
social
moral
and
religious
these
are
represented
by
the
of
the
story
in
accordance
with
this
design
the
hero
himself
if
so
he
may
be
called
has
no
pronounced
traits
is
more
negative
than
positive
but
is
brought
into
contact
with
many
very
positive
characters
his
life
is
the
stage
on
which
these
characters
perform
a
ground
is
thus
provided
for
the
numerous
portraits
of
which
the
author
large
experience
furnished
the
originals
and
for
lessons
of
practical
wisdom
derived
from
his
close
observation
of
men
and
things
and
his
lifelong
reflection
thereon
wilhelm
meister
if
not
the
most
artistic
is
the
most
instructive
and
in
that
view
next
to
faust
the
most
important
of
works
in
it
he
has
embodied
his
philosophy
of
life
a
philosophy
far
enough
removed
from
the
epicurean
views
which
ignorance
has
ascribed
to
him
a
philosophy
which
is
best
described
by
the
term
its
keynote
is
renunciation
with
renunciation
begins
the
true
life
was
the
author
favorite
maxim
and
the
second
part
of
wilhelm
meister
the
bears
the
collateral
title
that
is
the
renouncing
or
the
the
characters
that
figure
in
this
second
part
most
of
whom
have
had
their
training
in
the
first
form
a
society
whose
principle
of
union
is
and
a
life
of
beneficent
activity
the
most
fascinating
character
in
wilhelm
meister
the
wonder
and
delight
of
the
reader
is
mignon
the
a
pure
creation
of
goethe
genius
without
a
prototype
in
literature
readers
of
scott
will
remember
fenella
the
elfish
maiden
in
peveril
of
the
peak
scott
says
in
his
preface
to
that
novel
the
character
of
fenella
which
from
its
peculiarity
made
a
favorable
impression
on
the
public
was
far
from
being
original
the
fine
sketch
of
mignon
in
wilhelm
a
celebrated
work
from
the
pen
of
goethe
gave
the
idea
of
such
a
being
but
the
copy
will
be
found
to
be
greatly
different
from
my
great
prototype
nor
can
i
be
accused
of
borrowing
anything
save
the
general
idea
as
i
remember
fenella
the
resemblance
to
mignon
is
merely
superficial
a
certain
weirdness
is
all
they
have
in
common
the
intensity
of
the
inner
life
the
unspeakable
longing
the
cry
of
the
unsatisfied
heart
the
devout
aspiration
the
presentiment
of
the
heavenly
life
which
characterize
mignon
are
peculiar
to
her
they
constitute
her
individuality
wilhelm
has
found
her
a
kidnapped
child
attached
to
a
strolling
circus
company
and
has
rescued
her
from
the
cruel
hands
of
the
manager
thenceforth
she
clings
to
him
with
a
passionate
devotion
in
which
gratitude
for
her
deliverance
filial
affection
and
the
love
of
a
maiden
for
her
hero
are
strangely
blended
afflicted
with
a
disease
of
the
heart
she
is
subject
to
terrible
convulsions
which
increase
the
tenderness
of
her
protector
for
the
doomed
child
after
one
of
these
attacks
in
which
she
had
been
suffering
frightful
pain
we
read
he
held
her
fast
she
wept
and
no
tongue
can
express
the
force
of
those
tears
her
long
hair
had
become
unfastened
and
hung
loose
over
her
shoulders
her
whole
being
seemed
to
be
melting
away
at
last
she
raised
herself
up
a
mild
cheerfulness
gleamed
from
her
face

cried

before

a
harp
began
to
sound
the
old
harper
was
bringing
his
heartiest
songs
as
an
evening
sacrifice
to
his
friend
then
bursts
on
the
reader
that
song
in
which
the
soul
of
mignon
with
its
unconquerable
yearnings
is
forever
embalmed

footnote
literally

it
well
but
the
word
well
in
this
case
does
not
answer
to
the
german
the
elective
affinities
has
been
strangely
misinterpreted
as
having
an
immoral
tendency
as
encouraging
conjugal
infidelity
and
approving
free
love
that
any
one
who
has
read
the
work
with
attention
to
the
end
could
so
misjudge
it
seems
incredible
precisely
the
reverse
of
this
its
aim
is
to
enforce
the
sanctity
of
the
nuptial
bond
by
showing
the
tragic
consequences
resulting
from
its
violation
though
only
in
thought
and
feeling
here
a
word
concerning
one
merit
of
goethe
which
seems
to
me
not
to
have
been
sufficiently
appreciated
by
even
his
admirers
his
loving
skill
in
the
delineation
of
female
character
the
commanding
place
he
assigns
to
woman
in
his
writings
his
full
recognition
of
the
importance
of
feminine
influence
in
human
destiny
the
prophetic
utterance
which
forms
the
conclusion
of
faust
the
ever
womanly
draws
us
on
is
the
summing
up
of
goethe
own
experience
of
life
few
men
had
ever
such
wide
opportunities
of
acquaintance
with
women
if
on
the
one
hand
his
loves
had
revealed
to
him
the
passional
side
of
feminine
nature
he
had
enjoyed
on
the
other
the
friendship
of
some
of
the
purest
and
noblest
of
womankind
conspicuous
among
these
are
fräulein
von
klettenberg
and
the
duchess
luise
whom
no
one
says
lewes
ever
speaks
of
but
in
terms
of
veneration
no
poet
but
shakspeare
and
scarcely
shakspeare
has
set
before
the
world
so
rich
a
gallery
of
female
portraits
they
range
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
from
the
wanton
to
the
saint
they
are
drawn
in
firm
lines
and
limned
in
imperishable
colors
each
bearing
the
stamp
of
her
own
individuality
and
each
confessing
a
master
hand
these
may
be
considered
as
representing
different
phases
of
the
experience
different
in
his
view
of
life
the
ever
womanly
draws
us
on
so
goethe
of
all
men
most
susceptible
of
feminine
influence
was
led
by
it
from
weakness
to
strength
from
dissipation
to
concentration
from
doubt
to
clearness
from
tumult
to
repose
from
the
earthly
to
the
heavenly
faust
goethe
appears
to
have
derived
his
knowledge
of
the
faust
legend
partly
from
the
work
of
widmann
published
in
partly
from
another
more
modern
in
its
form
which
appeared
in
and
partly
from
the
puppet
plays
exhibited
in
frankfort
and
other
cities
of
germany
of
which
that
legend
was
then
a
favorite
theme
he
was
not
the
only
writer
of
that
day
who
made
use
of
it
some
thirty
of
his
contemporaries
had
produced
their
fausts
during
the
interval
which
elapsed
between
the
inception
and
publication
of
his
great
work
oblivion
overtook
them
all
with
the
exception
of
lessing
of
which
a
few
fragments
are
left
the
manuscript
of
the
complete
work
was
unaccountably
lost
on
its
way
to
the
publisher

dresden
and
leipsic
footnote
the
earlier
work
of

the
composition

was
not
completed
till
the
year
at
the
age
of
but
the
effect
of
the
long
arrest
which
after
goethe
removal
to
weimar
delayed
the
completion
of
the
faust
is
most
apparent
in
the
wide
gulf
which
separates
as
to
character
and
style
the
second
part
from
the
first
so
great
indeed
is
the
distance
between
the
two
that
without
external
historical
proofs
of
identity
it
would
seem
from
internal
evidence
altogether
improbable
in
spite
of
the
slender
thread
of
the
fable
which
connects
them
that
both
poems
were
the
work
of
one
and
the
same
author
and
really
the
author
was
not
the
same
the
change
which
had
come
over
goethe
on
his
return
from
italy
had
gone
down
to
the
very
springs
of
his
intellectual
life
the
fervor
and
the
rush
the
sparkle
and
foam
of
his
early
productions
had
been
replaced
by
the
stately
calm
and
the
luminous
breadth
of
view
that
is
born
of
experience
the
torrent
of
the
mountains
had
become
the
river
of
the
plain
romantic
impetuosity
had
changed
to
classic
repose
he
could
still
by
occasional
efforts
of
the
will
cast
himself
back
into
the
old
moods
resume
the
old
thread
and
so
complete
the
first
faust
but
we
may
confidently
assert
that
he
could
not
after
the
age
of
forty
have
originated
the
poem
any
more
than
before
his
italian
tour
he
could
have
written
the
second
faust
purporting
to
be
a
continuation
of
the
first
the
difference
in
spirit
and
style
is
enormous
as
to
the
question
which
of
the
two
is
the
greater
production
it
is
like
asking
which
is
the
greater
dante
commedia
or
macbeth
they
are
incommensurable
as
to
which
is
the
more
generally
interesting
no
question
can
arise
there
are
thousands
who
enjoy
and
admire
the
first
part
to
one
who
even
reads
the
second
the
interest
of
the
former
is
poetic
and
thoroughly
human
the
interest
of
the
other
is
partly
poetic
but
mostly
philosophic
and
scientific
the
symbolical
character
of
faust
is
assumed
by
all
the
critics
and
in
part
confessed
by
the
author
himself
besides
the
general
symbolism
pervading
and
motiving
the
whole
a
symbolism
of
human
destiny
and
here
and
there
a
shadowing
forth
of
the
poet
private
experience
there
are
special
allusions
local
personal
enigmatic
conceits
which
have
furnished
topics
of
learned
discussion
and
taxed
the
ingenuity
of
numerous
commentators
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
with
these
subtleties
but
little
exegesis
is
needed
for
a
right
comprehension
of
the
true
and
substantial
import
of
the
work
the
key
to
the
plot
is
given
in
the
prologue
in
heaven
the
devil
in
the
character
of
mephistopheles
asks
permission
to
tempt
faust
he
boasts
his
ability
to
get
entire
possession
of
his
soul
and
drag
him
down
to
hell
the
lord
grants
the
permission
and
prophesies
the
failure
of
the
attempt
be
it
allowed
draw
this
spirit
from
its
source
if
you
can
lay
hold
of
him
bear
him
with
you
on
your
downward
path
and
stand
ashamed
when
you
are
forced
to
confess
that
a
good
man
in
his
dark
strivings
has
a
consciousness
of
the
right
way
here
we
have
a
hint
of
the
author
design
he
does
not
intend
that
the
devil
shall
succeed
he
does
not
mean
to
adopt
the
conclusion
of
the
legend
and
send
faust
to
hell
he
had
the
penetration
to
see
and
he
meant
to
show
that
the
notion
implied
in
the
old
popular
superstition
of
selling
one
soul
to
the
devil
the
notion
that
evil
can
obtain
the
entire
and
final
possession
of
the
soul
is
a
fallacy
that
the
soul
is
not
man
to
dispose
of
and
can
not
be
so
traded
away
we
are
the
soul
not
the
soul
ours
evil
is
the
good
in
man
must
finally
prevail
so
long
as
he
strives
he
is
not
lost
heaven
will
come
to
the
aid
of
his
better
nature
this
is
the
doctrine
the
philosophy
of
faust
in
the
first
part
stung
by
disappointment
in
his
search
of
knowledge
by
failure
to
lay
hold
of
the
superhuman
and
urged
on
by
his
baser
propensities
personified
in
mephistopheles
faust
abandons
himself
to
sensual
pleasure
seduces
innocence
burdens
his
soul
with
heavy
guilt
and
seems
to
be
entirely
given
over
to
evil
this
part
ends
with
mephistopheles
imperious
call
her
zu
mir
as
if
secure
of
his
victim
before
the
appearance
of
the
second
part
the
reader
was
at
liberty
to
accept
that
conclusion
but
in
the
second
part
faust
gradually
wakes
from
the
intoxication
of
passion
outgrows
the
dominion
of
appetite
plans
great
and
useful
works
whereby
mephistopheles
loses
more
and
more
his
hold
of
him
and
after
his
death
is
baffled
in
his
attempt
to
appropriate
faust
immortal
part
to
which
the
heavenly
powers
assert
their
right
the
character
of
margaret
is
unique
its
duplicate
is
not
to
be
found
in
all
the
picture
galleries
of
fiction
shakspeare
in
the
wide
range
of
his
feminine
has
no
portrait
like
this
a
girl
of
low
birth
and
vulgar
circumstance
imbued
with
the
ideas
and
habits
of
her
class
speaking
the
language
of
that
class
from
which
she
never
for
a
moment
deviates
into
finer
phrase
takes
on
through
the
magic
handling
of
the
poet
an
ideal
beauty
externally
common
and
prosaic
in
all
her
ways
she
is
yet
thoroughly
poetic
transfigured
in
our
conception
by
her
perfect
love
to
that
love
unreasoning
unsuspecting
to
the
excess
of
that
which
in
itself
is
no
fault
but
beautiful
and
good
her
fall
and
ruin
are
due
her
story
is
the
tragedy
of
her
sex
in
all
time
as
schlegel
said
of
the
prometheus
bound
it
is
not
a
single
tragedy
but
tragedy
itself
the
first
part
ends
with
the
prison
scene
where
poor
margaret
escaping
by
death
ascends
to
heaven
while
mephistopheles
shouting
an
imperious
hither
to
me
disappears
with
faust
the
reader
is
allowed
to
suppose
and
most
readers
did
suppose
that
the
author
meant
it
should
be
inferred
that
the
devil
had
secured
his
victim
and
that
faust
according
to
the
legend
had
paid
the
forfeit
of
his
soul
to
the
powers
of
hell
but
faust
reappears
in
a
new
poem
the
second
part
he
is
there
introduced
sleeping
as
if
burying
in
torpor
the
lusts
and
crimes
and
sorrows
of
his
past
career
pitying
spirits
are
about
him
to
heal
his
woes
and
promote
his
return
to
a
better
life
at
the
end
of
his
hundred
years
of
earthly
life
mephistopheles
fails
to
secure
the
immortal
part
of
faust
which
the
angels
appropriate
and
bear
aloft
this
member
of
the
upper
spheres
we
rescue
from
the
devil
for
whoso
strives
and
perseveres
may
be
redeemed
from
evil
the
last
two
lines
may
be
supposed
to
contain
the
author
justification
of
mephistopheles
defeat
and
faust
salvation
though
a
man
surrender
himself
to
evil
if
there
is
that
in
him
which
evil
can
not
satisfy
an
impulse
by
which
he
outgrows
the
gratifications
of
vice
extends
his
horizon
and
lifts
his
desires
pursues
an
onward
course
until
he
learns
to
place
his
aims
outside
of
himself
and
to
seek
satisfaction
in
works
of
public
utility
he
is
beyond
the
power
of
satan
he
may
be
redeemed
from
evil
one
could
wish
indeed
that
more
decisive
marks
of
moral
development
had
been
exhibited
in
the
latter
stages
of
faust
career
but
here
comes
in
the
christian
doctrine
of
grace
which
goethe
applies
to
the
problem
of
man
destiny
faust
is
represented
as
saved
by
no
merit
of
his
own
but
by
the
interest
which
heaven
has
in
every
soul
in
which
there
is
the
possibility
of
a
heavenly
life
and
so
the
ascending
spirit
is
committed
by
the
mater
gloriosa
to
the
tutelage
of
gretchen
margaret
poenitentium
now
purified
from
all
the
stains
of
her
earthly
life
to
whom
is
given
the
injunction
lift
thyself
up
to
higher
spheres
when
he
divines
he
follow
thee
and
the
mystic
choir
chants
the
epilogue
which
embodies
the
moral
of
the
play
all
that
is
perishing
types
the
ideal
dream
of
our
cherishing
thus
becomes
real
superhumanly
here
it
is
done
the
ever
womanly
draweth
us
on
alfred
lord
tennyson
the
spirit
of
modern
poetry
by
mercer
adam
of
tennyson
what
can
one
write
freshly
that
will
not
seem
but
an
echo
of
what
has
been
said
or
written
of
england
noble
singer
who
on
the
death
of
wordsworth
now
over
half
a
century
ago
assumed
the
official
bays
of
the
english
laureateship
personal
homage
of
course
one
can
pay
to
the
illustrious
name
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
race
but
how
freshly
or
vitally
can
any
writer
now
speak
of
that
magnificent
body
of
his
verse
which
is
the
glory
of
his
age
of
the
nobility
and
knightly
virtues
of
its
author
character
of
the
splendor
of
his
genius
or
of
the
breadth
of
intellectual
and
spiritual
interests
which
was
so
signally
manifested
in
all
that
tennyson
thought
and
wrote
among
the
beacon
lights
in
the
present
series
of
volumes
the
laureate
of
the
age
has
not
hitherto
been
included
and
to
fill
the
gap
the
writer
of
this
sketch
has
ventured
not
of
course
to
say
all
that
might
be
said
of
the
great
poet
but
modestly
to
deal
with
the
man
and
his
art
so
that
neither
his
era
nor
his
work
shall
go
unchronicled
or
fail
of
some
recognition
however
inadequate
in
these
pages
tennyson
supreme
excellence
it
is
admitted
lies
not
so
much
in
his
themes
as
in
his
transcendent
art
it
is
this
that
has
given
him
his
hold
upon
a
cultured
age
and
won
for
him
immortality
his
work
is
the
perfection
of
literary
form
and
in
his
lyrical
pieces
especially
his
melody
is
exquisite
not
less
masterly
is
his
power
of
construction
while
his
sensibility
to
beauty
is
phenomenal
his
secluded
life
brought
him
close
to
nature
heart
and
made
him
familiar
with
her
every
voice
and
mood
in
interpreting
these
much
of
the
charm
lies
in
the
fidelity
of
his
descriptions
and
in
the
surpassing
beauty
of
the
in
the
shakespearian
sense
he
lacked
the
dramatic
faculty
and
he
had
but
slender
gifts
of
invention
and
creation
but
broad
if
not
always
strong
was
his
intelligence
and
keen
his
interest
in
the
problems
of
the
time
though
living
apart
from
the
world
he
was
yet
of
it
and
in
many
of
his
poems
may
be
traced
not
only
the
doings
but
the
thought
and
tendencies
of
his
age
his
christianity
though
undogmatic
was
real
and
pervasive
and
his
love
for
nature
was
a
devotion
in
national
affairs
as
befitted
the
official
singer
of
his
country
witness
his
fine
on
the
death
of
the
duke
of
wellington
he
showed
himself
the
historic
as
well
as
the
modern
englishman
and
great
was
his
reverence
for
law
and
freedom
attractive
also
if
at
times
somewhat
commonplace
is
the
quiet
domestic
sphere
which
tennyson
has
hallowed
in
the
many
modern
idylls
which
depict
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
humble
life
no
trait
in
the
poet
character
is
more
beautiful
than
the
sympathy
he
has
manifested
in
these
poems
with
the
world
toilers
while
nothing
could
well
be
more
touching
than
the
pathos
with
which
he
invests
their
simple
annals
typical
of
the
victorian
age
in
which
he
lived
tennyson
is
also
representative
of
its
highest
thought
and
culture
this
is
seen
not
only
in
the
thought
of
his
verse
but
in
its
splendid
forms
and
especially
in
the
technical
equipment
of
the
poet
in
his
dialogues
there
is
much
movement
and
action
and
he
had
consummate
skill
in
the
handling
of
metres
few
poets
have
approached
him
in
the
successful
writing
of
blank
verse
which
has
a
delightful
cadence
as
well
as
calm
strength
above
all
his
gifts
he
was
an
artist
in
words
his
ear
being
most
sensitively
attuned
and
his
taste
pure
and
refined
for
the
delicate
artistry
of
the
poet
work
in
this
respect
he
is
a
matchless
literary
workman
besides
the
music
of
his
verse
his
thought
is
ever
high
and
in
his
serious
moods
consecrated
to
noble
and
reverent
purposes
in
the
midst
of
the
negations
and
convulsive
movements
of
his
day
his
spirit
is
always
serene
and
his
thought
while
at
times
dreamily
melancholy
is
conserving
and
full
of
faith
highest
assurance
his
sympathy
with
his
was
keen
and
and
though
he
stood
aloof
from
the
conflict
and
struggle
of
his
day
he
was
far
from
indifferent
to
its
movements
and
with
high
purpose
strove
if
not
to
direct
at
least
to
reflect
them
this
was
specially
characteristic
of
the
man
and
in
the
conflict
with
doubt
no
poet
has
more
keenly
interpreted
the
mental
struggles
of
the
thoughtful
soul
and
the
deep
underlying
spirit
of
his
time
or
more
beneficently
given
the
age
an
assured
ground
of
faith
while
conserving
its
highest
and
dearest
hopes
happily
too
unlike
many
poets
his
own
character
was
lofty
and
blameless
and
hence
his
message
comes
with
more
consistency
as
well
as
with
a
higher
inspiration
and
power
nor
is
the
message
the
less
impressive
for
the
note
of
honest
doubt
which
finds
utterance
in
many
a
poem
or
for
the
intimation
of
a
creed
that
is
at
once
liberal
and
conservative
with
the
evidences
before
the
reader
that
the
poet
himself
had
had
his
own
and
periods
of
mental
conflict
his
counsellings
of
courage
and
faith
are
all
the
more
effective
as
they
are
in
unison
with
his
belief
in
the
upward
progress
of
the
race
and
his
unshaken
trust
in
a
higher
power
lacking
in
intensity
of
passion
and
dramatic
force
tennyson
here
again
is
but
typical
of
his
era
to
him
one
of
reposeful
content
and
calm
reasoning
progress
of
permanent
lasting
value
much
of
his
verse
undoubtedly
is
but
not
all
of
it
will
escape
the
indifference
of
posterity
or
the
and
censure
it
may
be
of
the
future
critic
he
had
not
the
stirring
strains
or
the
careless
rapture
of
other
and
earlier
poets
of
the
motherland
his
characteristic
is
more
contemplative
and
brooding
yet
his
range
is
unusually
comprehensive
and
his
power
varied
and
sustained
as
well
as
marked
by
the
highest
qualities
of
rhythmic
beauty
in
the
idyll
where
he
specially
shines
we
have
much
that
is
lovely
and
limpid
with
abounding
instances
of
that
felicitous
for
which
he
was
noted
this
is
especially
seen
in
the
simple
pastoral
idylls
such
as
may
queen
and
miller
daughter
or
in
those
tender
lyrics
such
as
galahad
dying
swan
and
talking
oak
in
the
ballads
and
songs
how
felicitous
again
is
the
poet
work
and
how
rich
yet
mellifluous
is
the
strain
had
tennyson
written
nothing
else
but
these
with
the
verse
included
in
the
volumes
issued
by
him
in
and
how
high
would
he
have
been
placed
in
the
choir
of
song
and
how
supreme
should
we
have
deemed
his
art
in
the
princess
alone
there
are
songs
that
would
have
made
any
poet
reputation
while
for
music
and
color
and
especially
for
perfection
of
poetic
workmanship
they
are
almost
matchless
in
their
beauty
fortunately
however
the
poet
was
to
give
us
much
even
beyond
these
surpassingly
beautiful
things
and
make
a
more
unique
and
distinctive
contribution
to
the
verse
of
his
era
in
the
years
that
followed
the
production
of
his
early
writings
the
poet
matures
in
thought
as
his
art
ripens
and
reaches
still
higher
qualities
of
craftsmanship
recluse
as
he
was
he
moreover
had
his
experiences
of
life
and
drank
deeply
of
sorrow
cup
as
we
see
in
in
memoriam
that
noble
tribute
to
his
youthful
friend
arthur
hallam
with
its
grand
hymnal
qualities
and
powerful
and
reverent
lessons
for
an
age
shifting
in
its
beliefs
and
unconfirmed
in
its
faith
in
later
work
from
his
pen
we
also
see
the
laureate
for
he
has
now
received
official
recognition
from
his
nation
in
his
relations
to
the
culture
as
well
as
to
the
thought
of
his
time
keeping
pace
with
the
age
in
all
its
complex
engrossments
and
problems
this
is
shown
in
much
and
varied
work
turned
out
with
its
author
loving
interest
in
the
poetic
art
and
with
characteristic
delicacy
and
finish
the
most
important
labor
of
this
later
time
includes
the
princess
maud
and
other
poems
enoch
arden
the
dramas
becket
queen
mary
and
harold
tiresias
demeter
the
foresters
but
above
all
and
most
notably
that
grand
epic
of
king
arthur
time
the
idylls
of
the
king
in
the
latter
the
most
characteristic
and
perhaps
the
most
permanent
of
tennyson
work
the
poet
manifests
his
historic
sense
and
love
for
england
legendary
past
and
achieves
his
design
not
only
to
glorify
it
but
to
imbue
it
with
a
deep
ethical
motive
and
underlying
purpose
the
expression
of
his
own
chivalrous
knightly
soul
and
strenuous
thoughtful
and
blameless
life
in
these
splendid
tales
of
we
have
the
full
flower
of
the
poet
genius
narrated
in
the
true
romantic
spirit
but
with
an
ideality
and
imagination
quite
tennysonian
and
with
a
spiritualistic
touch
in
harmony
with
the
voice
of
the
age
that
reminds
us
that
our
little
systems
have
their
day
they
have
their
day
and
cease
to
be
they
are
but
broken
lights
of
thee
and
thou
o
lord
art
more
than
they
it
is
with
such
themes
and
speculations
that
tennyson
has
powerfully
and
impressively
influenced
his
age
beyond
and
above
the
mere
artistry
of
the
poet
we
recognize
his
interest
in
man
higher
spiritual
being
his
love
for
nature
and
awe
in
contemplating
the
heights
and
depths
of
infinite
time
and
space
ever
looking
upward
and
inward
at
the
mysteries
of
the
world
behind
the
phenomena
of
sense
it
is
difficult
in
set
theological
terms
to
define
the
poet
creed
though
we
know
that
he
was
won
by
the
broad
church
teaching
of
his
friends
frederick
robertson
and
denison
maurice
and
had
himself
many
a
battle
to
fight
with
honest
doubts
until
as
his
the
bar
shows
us
he
finally
conquered
and
laid
them
but
while
there
is
an
absence
of
definite
doctrine
in
his
work
there
is
no
question
about
his
religious
convictions
or
of
his
belief
in
the
eternal
verities
the
immanence
of
god
in
man
and
the
universe
throughout
his
poems
he
assumes
the
existence
of
a
great
spirit
and
recognizes
that
our
souls
are
a
part
of
him
however
faith
at
times
seems
to
veil
her
face
from
the
poet
and
all
appears
a
mystery
though
a
mystery
presided
over
by
infinite
power
and
love
the
great
problems
of
metaphysics
and
of
man
origin
and
destiny
we
are
told
occupied
much
of
his
thought
and
he
dwelt
upon
them
with
eager
intense
interest
and
touched
upon
them
with
great
candor
earnestness
and
truthfulness
no
sophistry
could
shake
his
belief
in
man
immortality
for
without
belief
in
this
doctrine
the
human
race
he
was
convinced
had
not
incentive
enough
to
virtue
while
all
man
inspirations
were
otherwise
meaningless
for
the
doctrine
of
evolution
in
its
materialistic
aspect
he
had
nothing
but
scorn
though
he
accepted
it
in
the
more
spiritual
guise
with
which
russel
wallace
propounded
it
if
we
come
from
the
brutes
we
are
nevertheless
linked
with
the
divine
he
believed
and
it
was
the
divine
in
man
that
was
to
conquer
the
brute
within
him
and
in
the
upward
struggle
work
out
salvation
so
in
the
realm
of
physical
science
on
the
principles
of
which
as
huxley
tells
us
he
had
a
great
grasp
the
poet
while
appalled
by
the
mystery
accepts
and
indeed
rejoices
in
its
truths
though
he
can
not
acquiesce
in
a
godless
world
or
in
the
denial
of
a
life
to
come
in
which
the
race
through
infinite
love
shall
be
brought
into
union
with
god
but
leaving
here
tennyson
speculations
and
beliefs
a
most
interesting
part
of
the
poet
analytical
and
reflective
character
let
us
look
for
a
little
at
the
man
personally
and
record
briefly
the
chief
incidents
in
his
quiet
though
ideal
to
those
who
know
the
memoir
by
his
son
hallam
tennyson
a
memoir
that
while
paying
honor
to
filial
reverence
and
devotion
is
at
the
same
time
and
in
all
respects
most
worthy
of
its
high
theme
the
events
in
the
poet
life
will
hardly
need
dwelling
upon
though
they
throw
much
light
on
and
impart
the
distinction
of
a
high
dignity
to
the
laureate
work
the
life
hallam
tennyson
describes
was
we
know
not
lived
in
the
public
eye
and
was
wholly
without
sensational
elements
or
any
of
the
vapid
interests
which
usually
attach
to
a
man
whose
name
is
in
a
special
sense
public
property
and
about
whom
the
world
was
eagerly
and
often
officiously
curious
the
life
the
poet
lived
in
a
popular
sense
lacked
all
that
usually
attracts
the
masses
for
he
was
personally
little
known
to
his
generation
rarely
seen
among
large
gatherings
of
the
people
and
great
englishman
as
he
was
was
almost
a
stranger
in
his
later
years
at
least
in
the
english
metropolis
or
if
we
except
the
seats
of
the
universities
in
any
of
the
chief
towns
of
the
kingdom
and
yet
in
another
and
a
higher
sense
the
century
has
hardly
known
among
its
many
intellectual
forces
one
that
has
been
more
influential
in
its
effect
upon
literary
art
or
in
certain
directions
has
more
potently
influenced
the
ideals
and
more
profoundly
given
expression
to
the
ethical
and
philosophic
thought
of
the
time
secluded
as
his
life
was
it
was
one
not
of
obscurity
or
of
mere
asceticism
on
the
contrary
it
was
rich
in
all
the
elements
that
make
for
a
great
reputation
and
ever
devoted
to
strenuous
elevating
purpose
and
to
an
ideal
poetic
career
so
far
as
his
tastes
and
opportunity
offered
tennyson
life
moreover
was
enriched
by
many
wise
and
noble
friendships
and
by
intimacy
with
not
a
few
of
the
best
and
most
thoughtful
minds
of
his
age
it
was
spent
we
rejoice
to
think
also
in
unceasing
toil
in
and
for
his
high
art
with
a
resulting
productiveness
which
proved
the
extent
and
varied
range
of
his
labors
as
well
as
the
mastery
of
his
craft
until
the
appearance
of
the
biography
referred
to
we
had
known
the
laureate
almost
wholly
through
his
books
now
thanks
to
the
authoritative
record
of
his
accomplished
surviving
son
we
know
the
poet
as
he
lived
and
feel
that
behind
his
writings
there
is
a
personality
of
the
most
interesting
and
impressive
kind
it
is
a
personality
such
as
consorts
with
the
opinions
which
most
thoughtful
readers
of
writings
must
have
had
of
one
of
the
greatest
and
serenest
minds
of
the
age
a
poet
who
aside
from
the
splendor
of
his
workmanship
and
the
beauty
and
melody
of
his
verse
has
greatly
enriched
the
poetic
literature
of
the
century
and
has
we
feel
given
profound
thought
to
the
intellectual
problems
and
spiritual
aspirations
of
his
era
nor
does
the
memoir
as
a
revelation
of
the
poet
intellectual
and
personal
life
fall
away
on
any
page
of
it
from
the
high
plane
on
which
it
has
been
prepared
and
written
there
is
no
undue
invasion
which
a
pride
might
be
apt
to
make
of
domestic
privacy
and
no
dealing
with
irrelevant
topics
or
elaboration
of
those
set
forth
with
becoming
modesty
and
restraint
far
less
is
there
the
discussion
of
any
subject
for
a
trivial
or
vain
purpose
throughout
the
work
we
meet
with
no
unnecessary
lifting
of
veils
or
treatment
of
themes
merely
to
satisfy
morbid
curiosity
everywhere
there
is
the
evidence
of
sound
judgment
unimpeachable
taste
and
a
wholesome
sanity
this
is
especially
the
case
in
the
frank
revelation
of
the
poet
views
on
religion
and
his
attitude
towards
scientific
and
theological
thought
to
which
we
have
ourselves
referred
in
this
respect
a
large
debt
is
due
to
the
biographer
for
setting
before
the
reader
not
only
the
high
ethical
purpose
which
tennyson
had
in
view
in
selecting
the
themes
of
his
poems
and
in
the
mode
of
handling
them
but
as
we
have
said
in
showing
us
what
beyond
peradventure
were
his
religious
opinions
and
despite
a
certain
curtaining
of
gloom
how
profoundly
he
was
influenced
by
faith
in
the
divine
life
nor
is
the
least
interest
in
the
memoir
to
be
found
in
the
light
the
biographer
throws
on
the
poet
writings
as
a
whole
how
they
were
conceived
and
elaborated
and
on
the
often
hidden
meaning
that
underlies
some
of
the
most
thoughtful
verse
this
to
students
of
the
laureate
writings
is
of
high
value
in
addition
to
the
service
rendered
by
the
biographer
in
tracing
in
his
father
poetic
work
the
influences
which
fashioned
it
and
the
pains
he
took
to
give
it
its
marvellous
beauty
and
artistic
finish
of
expression
it
is
this
instructive
as
well
as
skilled
and
dignified
treatment
with
the
vast
literary
and
deep
personal
interest
in
the
life
that
will
commend
the
memoir
to
all
who
are
proud
of
the
laureate
fame
and
wished
to
have
nothing
written
that
was
unworthy
of
either
the
poet
or
the
man
or
that
would
in
the
least
detract
from
his
laurels
nor
does
the
restraint
which
the
biographer
imposes
upon
himself
conceal
from
us
the
man
in
his
human
aspects
or
lead
him
to
set
before
the
reader
an
imaginary
rather
than
a
veritable
and
real
portraiture
we
have
a
picture
it
is
true
of
an
almost
ideal
domestic
life
and
of
a
man
of
rare
gifts
and
fine
culture
whose
work
and
career
have
been
and
are
the
pride
and
glory
of
the
race
but
we
have
also
the
story
of
an
author
not
free
from
human
weaknesses
and
though
endowed
with
manifold
and
great
gifts
yet
who
had
to
labor
long
and
earnestly
to
perfect
himself
in
his
art
and
in
his
early
years
had
much
discouragement
and
not
a
little
adversity
to
contend
with
with
all
the
toil
and
stress
his
early
years
had
known
when
success
came
to
the
poet
no
one
was
less
unspoiled
by
it
and
when
sunshine
fell
upon
and
gilded
his
life
maturing
years
brought
him
serenity
happiness
and
at
length
peace
alfred
tennyson
was
born
at
his
father
rectory
somersby
lincolnshire
august
he
was
the
fourth
of
twelve
children
seven
of
whom
were
sons
two
of
them
frederick
and
charles
being
endowed
like
alfred
with
poetic
gifts
the
poet
mother
a
woman
of
sweet
and
tender
disposition
had
much
to
do
in
moulding
the
future
character
while
from
his
father
a
man
of
fine
culture
he
received
not
only
much
of
his
education
but
his
bent
towards
a
recluse
bookish
career
alfred
was
from
his
earliest
days
a
retired
shy
child
fond
of
reading
and
given
to
rhyming
and
with
a
characteristic
love
of
nature
and
of
quiet
rural
life
later
on
he
had
a
passion
for
the
and
for
those
scenes
of
storm
and
stress
about
the
seagirt
shores
of
old
england
which
he
was
so
feelingly
and
with
such
poetic
beauty
to
depict
in
sea
dreams
and
in
those
incomparable
songs
embodiments
at
once
of
sorrow
and
of
faith
break
break
and
the
bar
besides
the
education
he
received
from
his
scholarly
father
and
at
a
school
at
louth
for
four
years
young
tennyson
spent
some
years
at
trinity
college
cambridge
where
though
he
did
not
take
a
degree
he
won
in
the
chancellor
medal
for
the
best
english
poem
of
the
year
the
subject
of
which
was
at
college
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
number
among
his
friends
several
men
who
later
in
life
were
like
himself
to
rise
to
eminence
such
as
henry
alford
afterwards
dean
of
canterbury
trench
later
archbishop
of
dublin
merivale
historian
and
dean
of
ely
monckton
milnes
lord
houghton
james
spedding
editor
of
lord
bacon
works
macaulay
thackeray
and
most
endeared
of
all
arthur
henry
hallam
son
of
the
historian
whose
memory
tennyson
has
immortalized
in
in
memoriam
with
him
at
college
was
also
his
brother
charles
one
year
his
senior
with
whom
he
collaborated
in
the
collection
of
verse
issued
in
under
the
title
of
poems
by
two
brothers
in
tennyson
made
a
journey
to
the
pyrenees
with
arthur
hallam
who
was
engaged
to
the
poet
sister
emilia
and
in
the
same
year
he
published
an
independent
volume
entitled
poems
chiefly
lyrical
in
this
his
first
venture
alone
in
poetry
and
in
another
issued
in
tennyson
was
to
manifest
to
the
world
his
poetic
powers
and
art
for
they
contained
besides
much
rhythmical
and
contemplative
verse
such
poems
as
clare
lotus
eaters
dream
of
pair
women
may
queen
and
miller
daughter
in
spite
of
the
great
promise
bodied
forth
in
these
works
the
volumes
were
subject
to
not
a
little
unfavorable
criticism
which
stayed
his
further
publishing
for
a
period
of
ten
years
though
not
the
furtherance
of
his
creative
work
nor
his
enthusiastic
efforts
towards
increasing
the
perfection
of
his
art
it
was
not
until
that
the
poet
again
appeared
in
print
this
time
with
a
volume
to
which
he
appended
his
name
poems
by
alfred
tennyson
and
which
gave
him
high
rank
among
the
acknowledged
singers
of
his
day
wordsworth
southey
landor
campbell
rogers
and
leigh
hunt
in
england
and
in
the
new
world
longfellow
bryant
lowell
whittier
and
emerson
the
of
his
youth
byron
scott
coleridge
shelley
and
keats
had
by
this
time
all
died
and
in
southey
died
when
wordsworth
whom
tennyson
reverenced
became
poet
laureate
the
gap
occasioned
by
the
death
of
these
early
english
poets
of
the
century
was
now
to
be
filled
in
large
measure
by
tennyson
though
among
the
writers
of
song
to
arise
were
the
brownings
rossetti
matthew
arnold
and
swinburne
critical
appreciation
of
the
volume
of
was
happily
encouraging
to
the
poet
indeed
it
was
most
gratifying
for
its
many
remarkable
beauties
were
now
justly
and
adequately
appraised
particularly
such
fine
new
themes
as
the
volume
contained
two
voices
talking
oak
hall
vision
of
sin
and
the
germ
of
the
future
idylls
of
the
king
nor
on
this
side
the
atlantic
did
the
new
volume
lack
substantial
recognition
and
from
such
competent
critics
as
emerson
and
hawthorne
while
among
his
english
contemporaries
tennyson
became
if
we
except
for
the
time
wordsworth
the
acknowledged
head
of
english
song
at
this
period
the
poet
resided
in
london
or
its
neighborhood
his
family
home
in
lincolnshire
having
been
broken
up
in
six
years
after
the
death
of
his
father
here
in
spite
of
the
secluded
life
he
led
he
became
a
notable
figure
in
literary
circles
and
greatly
increased
the
range
of
his
friends
correspondents
and
admirers
among
the
latter
were
the
carlyles
thomas
and
his
clever
wife
jane
being
especially
drawn
to
the
poet
and
to
them
we
owe
interesting
sketches
of
the
personal
appearance
of
tennyson
at
this
time
carlyle
in
one
of
her
delightful
letters
gossiping
about
dickens
and
tennyson
esteems
the
latter
the
greatest
genius
of
the
three
adding
that
besides
he
is
a
very
handsome
man
and
a
one
with
something
of
the
gypsy
in
his
appearance
which
for
me
is
perfectly
charming
this
is
the
historian
her
husband
piece
of
portraiture
a
fine
man
dusty
smoky
who
swims
outwardly
and
inwardly
with
great
composure
in
an
articulate
element
as
of
tranquil
chaos
and
tobacco
smoke
great
now
and
then
when
he
does
emerge
a
most
restful
brotherly
man
another
portrait
we
have
from
the
chelsea
philosopher
and
scorner
of
shams
which
describes
the
poet
very
humanly
as
one
of
the
men
in
the
world
with
a
great
shock
of
rough
dusky
dark
hair
bright
laughing
hazel
eyes
massive
aquiline
face
most
massive
yet
most
delicate
of
complexion
almost
indian
looking
clothes
cynically
loose
smokes
infinite
tobacco
his
voice
is
musical
metallic
fit
for
loud
laughter
and
piercing
wail
and
all
that
may
lie
between
speech
and
speculation
free
and
plenteous
i
do
not
meet
in
these
late
decades
such
company
over
a
pipe
we
shall
see
what
he
will
grow
to
besides
the
carlyles
and
other
notable
contemporaries
tennyson
numbered
at
this
time
among
his
intimates
john
sterling
whose
life
was
written
by
the
author
of
sartor
resartus
james
spedding
bacon
editor
who
wrote
a
fine
critique
of
the
volume
of
poems
for
the
edinburgh
review
aubrey
de
vere
edmund
lushington
stanley
afterwards
dean
of
westminster
and
edward
fitzgerald
the
future
translator
of
the
rubaiyat
or
quatrains
of
the
persian
poet
omar
khayyam
these
were
all
enthusiastic
admirers
of
tennyson
work
and
art
and
his
close
personal
friends
who
have
left
on
record
many
interesting
sketches
of
the
poet
in
their
published
writings
or
in
letters
to
him
and
especially
in
reminiscences
furnished
for
the
memoir
by
the
poet
son
nine
years
before
the
appearance
of
the
volume
of
tennyson
verse
the
poet
bosom
friend
arthur
hallam
died
at
an
immature
age
at
vienna
and
his
death
was
the
subject
of
much
brooding
in
noble
elegiac
verse
written
as
was
milton
to
commemorate
the
loss
of
one
very
dear
to
the
poet
in
in
memoriam
as
all
know
tennyson
sought
to
assuage
his
grief
and
give
fine
artistic
expression
to
his
profound
sorrow
at
the
loss
of
his
companion
and
friend
but
the
work
is
more
than
a
labored
monument
of
woe
since
it
enshrines
reflections
of
the
most
exalted
and
inspiring
character
on
the
eternally
momentous
themes
of
life
death
and
immortality
the
work
was
published
in
and
it
at
once
challenged
the
admiration
of
the
world
for
the
perfection
of
its
art
no
less
than
for
its
high
contemplative
beauty
this
was
the
year
when
wordsworth
passed
to
the
grave
and
tennyson
in
his
room
was
given
the
english
laureateship
in
this
year
also
we
find
him
happily
married
to
emily
sellwood
a
lady
of
berks
to
whom
the
poet
had
been
engaged
since
with
his
bride
he
took
up
house
at
twickenham
near
london
where
his
son
hallam
tennyson
was
born
in
in
the
following
year
he
removed
to
farringford
on
the
isle
of
wight
which
was
to
be
his
home
for
forty
years
and
where
as
his
son
tells
us
some
of
his
works
were
written
here
in
his
second
son
lionel
was
born
whose
young
life
of
promise
was
terminated
by
jungle
fever
years
later
on
a
return
voyage
from
india
all
that
was
mortal
of
him
finding
repose
in
the
depths
of
the
red
sea
to
complete
the
chief
incidents
in
the
poet
personal
career
we
may
here
record
that
while
tennyson
acquired
another
home
at
aldworth
surrey
where
he
died
followed
some
four
years
later
by
his
wife
his
happiest
days
were
spent
at
farringford
the
pilgrimage
place
of
many
eminent
worshippers
of
the
poet
muse
where
was
dispensed
an
unostentatious
but
and
genial
british
hospitality
it
should
be
added
that
besides
the
perquisites
which
attach
to
the
office
of
the
poet
laureate
tennyson
was
given
from
a
pension
of
and
that
while
in
he
refused
a
baronetcy
in
he
accepted
a
peerage
and
had
the
honor
of
burial
in
westminster
abbey
we
now
revert
to
the
poet
early
or
rather
to
his
creative
years
and
to
a
resume
of
his
principal
writings
with
a
brief
running
comment
on
his
message
and
art
in
three
years
before
he
became
laureate
he
published
the
princess
a
charming
narrative
poem
in
blank
verse
which
though
it
abounds
in
fine
descriptions
and
has
an
obvious
moral
in
the
treatment
of
the
theme
the
woman
question
of
today
is
inherently
lacking
in
unity
and
strength
as
well
as
weak
in
the
depicting
of
the
characters
in
later
editions
the
poem
was
amended
in
several
faulty
respects
and
was
especially
enriched
by
the
insertion
between
the
cantos
of
many
lovely
and
now
familiar
songs
which
serve
not
only
to
bind
together
the
whole
structure
of
the
poem
but
to
enhance
and
enforce
its
high
moral
meaning
any
analysis
of
the
princess
is
here
deemed
unnecessary
since
it
must
not
only
be
familiar
to
most
readers
of
the
poet
works
but
familiar
also
in
the
varied
annotated
editions
of
such
editors
as
rolfe
woodberry
and
wilson
farrand
familiar
it
is
believed
also
that
it
will
be
to
tennysonian
students
in
the
study
of
the
princess
with
critical
and
explanatory
notes
by
dawson
of
montreal
now
of
ottawa
canada
an
able
commentary
which
received
the
approval
of
lord
tennyson
himself
and
elicited
from
him
a
highly
interesting
letter
to
the
author
on
points
in
the
poem
either
misunderstood
or
not
discerningly
apprehended
by
other
critics
and
reviewers
the
purport
of
the
poem
it
may
be
said
however
is
to
frown
upon
revolutionary
attempts
to
alter
the
position
of
women
of
scholastically
and
dames
who
would
seek
by
other
than
nature
ways
to
put
the
sex
upon
an
equality
with
man
while
repressing
their
own
individuality
doing
violence
to
their
maternal
instincts
and
trampling
upon
their
gracious
household
ways
in
the
handling
of
the
medley
tennyson
brings
into
exercise
not
only
his
powers
which
were
greatly
in
advance
of
his
time
but
his
gifts
of
raillery
and
humor
especially
in
the
early
divisions
of
the
poem
as
well
as
his
high
serious
motives
in
the
moral
lessons
to
which
he
points
in
the
later
cantos
where
he
aims
at
the
elevation
of
women
in
correspondence
with
the
diversity
of
their
natures
for
as
he
himself
says
woman
is
not
undeveloped
man
but
diverse
his
ideal
of
perfect
womanhood
he
would
attain
through
the
awakening
power
of
the
affections
and
the
transforming
power
of
love
rather
than
by
ignoring
the
difference
of
physique
founding
women
universities
and
becoming
high
priestesses
of
learning
of
the
medley
of
characters
in
the
poem
in
disguise
at
the
college
lady
principals
with
prudes
for
proctors
dowagers
for
deans
and
sweet
in
their
golden
hair
it
is
lady
psyche
child
that
is
the
true
effective
heroine
of
the
story
as
dawson
aptly
points
out
ridiculous
in
the
lecture
room
the
babe
in
the
poem
as
in
the
songs
is
made
the
central
point
upon
which
the
plot
turns
for
the
unconscious
child
is
the
concrete
embodiment
of
nature
herself
clearing
away
all
merely
intellectual
theories
by
her
silent
influence
this
is
the
explanation
then
of
the
appearance
of
the
babe
symbol
of
the
power
and
tenderness
of
nature
in
critical
passages
of
the
poem
as
well
as
in
the
unsurpassably
beautiful
intercalary
songs
for
it
is
the
child
that
enables
the
poet
to
soften
the
princess
nature
toward
the
prince
and
to
effect
the
reconciliation
between
the
princess
and
lady
psyche
while
imparting
beauty
as
well
as
high
meaning
in
the
recital
of
the
incidents
and
development
of
the
tale
in
memoriam
as
we
have
stated
appeared
in
and
was
unique
in
its
appeal
to
the
mind
of
the
era
as
a
stately
meditative
poem
on
a
single
theme
the
death
of
the
poet
friend
arthur
hallam
the
english
language
if
we
except
milton
and
to
the
nativity
and
wordsworth
grand
on
intimations
of
immortality
has
no
poem
so
noble
or
so
faultless
in
its
art
as
this
magnificent
series
of
detached
elegies
the
high
thought
philosophic
reflection
and
passionate
religious
sentiment
that
mark
the
whole
work
added
to
the
exquisiteness
of
the
versification
place
it
wellnigh
supreme
in
the
literature
of
elegiac
poetry
its
grave
majestic
hymnal
measure
adds
to
its
solemn
beauty
and
stateliness
while
the
varied
phases
of
spiritualized
thought
and
emotional
grief
which
find
expression
in
the
poem
seem
to
elevate
it
in
its
harmonies
to
the
rank
of
a
profound
from
the
choir
of
heaven
in
the
sumptuously
embellished
edition
of
the
elegy
embodying
harry
fenn
drawings
with
a
sympathetic
preface
by
the
rev
henry
van
dyke
there
is
a
brief
but
luminous
analysis
of
the
nine
divisions
of
the
poem
or
commentary
on
the
great
classic
to
those
who
desire
to
read
the
great
elegy
understandingly
the
value
of
van
dyke
work
is
earnestly
commended
since
without
this
commentary
or
such
as
are
to
be
obtained
in
other
critical
sources
there
is
much
of
poetic
beauty
of
thought
and
especially
of
emotional
reflection
on
life
death
and
immortality
in
the
hundred
and
thirty
lyrics
of
which
the
poem
consists
which
will
be
lost
to
even
the
thoughtful
reader
the
poem
as
a
critic
truthfully
observes
has
done
much
to
express
and
to
consolidate
all
that
is
best
in
the
life
of
england
its
domestic
affection
its
patriotic
feeling
its
healthful
morality
its
rational
and
earnest
religion
the
sentimental
metrical
romance
maud
appeared
in
the
year
of
the
crimean
war
with
some
additional
poems
including
charge
of
the
light
brigade
written
after
raglan
repulse
of
the
russians
at
balaclava
and
the
fine
on
the
death
of
the
duke
of
wellington
the
lyrical
maud
we
are
told
was
one
of
favorite
productions
of
which
he
was
wont
to
read
parts
to
his
guests
as
the
poet
has
himself
said
of
the
monodrama
it
is
a
little
hamlet
the
history
of
a
morbid
poetic
soul
under
the
blighting
influence
of
a
recklessly
speculative
age
he
is
the
heir
of
madness
an
egotist
with
the
makings
of
a
cynic
raised
to
sanity
by
a
pure
and
holy
love
which
elevates
his
whole
nature
passing
from
the
heights
of
triumph
to
the
lowest
depths
of
misery
driven
into
madness
by
the
loss
of
her
whom
he
has
loved
and
when
he
has
at
length
passed
through
the
fiery
furnace
and
has
recovered
his
reason
giving
himself
up
to
work
for
the
good
of
mankind
through
the
unselfishness
born
of
his
great
passion
the
poem
when
it
appeared
was
reviled
by
some
critics
as
an
allegory
of
the
war
with
russia
and
they
did
its
author
the
injustice
of
supposing
that
he
lauded
war
for
war
sake
instead
of
as
is
the
case
applauding
war
only
in
defence
of
liberty
apart
from
this
misunderstanding
due
to
abhorrence
of
the
of
the
period
the
poem
has
outlived
the
mistaken
objections
to
it
when
it
appeared
and
is
now
admired
in
its
vindicated
light
and
especially
for
the
rich
and
copious
beauty
manifest
throughout
the
work
and
for
the
magnificent
lyric
art
with
which
it
is
composed
we
now
come
to
tennyson
masterpiece
the
idylls
of
the
king
an
epic
of
chivalry
interpreted
as
personifying
in
its
various
characters
the
soul
at
war
with
the
senses
these
appeared
during
the
years
and
each
of
the
idylls
which
has
a
connecting
thread
binding
it
to
its
takes
its
plot
or
fable
from
the
legendary
lore
that
has
clustered
round
the
name
of
arthur

king
of
the
britons
about
the

of

of
material
which
was
gathered
by
sir
thomas
malory
for
his

history
of
arthur
and
his
knights
tennyson
takes
the
chief
incidents
and
noblest
heroic
traits
of
character
in
the
legends
and
blends
them
in
a
fashion
of
his
own
steeping
them
in
an
atmosphere
which
his
imagination
creates
and
lighting
up
all
with
a
passion
and
glory
of
knightly
adventure
as
well
as
with
a
chasteness
purity
and
high
fervor
of
ethical
thought
that
must
perpetuate
the
romance
as
he
has
given
it
us
unto
all
time
the
sections
of
the
work
as
it
now
stands
in

closing
happily
long
after

telling
of

for

despite
its
mystic
character
this
is
admittedly
one
of
the
finest
of
the
series
of
idylls
and
rich
in
its
spiritual
teaching
that
the
heavenly
vision
is
to
be
seen
only
by

despite
his

in

on

arthur
with
his
great
high

pityingly

forgives
the
end
comes
with
the
sad
though
shadowy
of
arthur
the
royal
barge
mysteriously
carrying
him
out
into
the
beyond
whence
issue
sounds
of

and

enoch
arden
an
idyll
of
the
hearth
depicting
a
pathetic
incident
in
a
seafarer
career
of
much
simple
idyllic
beauty
the
poem
has
some
fine
descriptive
passages
and
many
examples
of
the
poet
rich
in
treating
of
the
splendid
tropic
scenery
among
which
the
mariner
is
for
the
time
cast
the
volume
contained
also
some
minor
pieces
including
the
dialect
poem
northern
farmer
with
its
humorous
rendering
of
yokel
speech
this
was
followed
by
three
dramas
on
english
historical
themes
which
as
the
poet
had
not
as
we
have
already
hinted
the
gifts
of
a
shakespeare
were
somewhat
unsuccessful
though
written
despite
tennyson
advanced
years
with
much
fine
force
and
vividness
of
character
delineation
these
dramas
to
enumerate
them
in
their
historic
order
were
harold
becket
and
queen
mary
becket
is
the
best
and
most
ambitious
of
them
though
not
as
queen
mary
is
a
play
designed
for
the
stage
it
is
a
vigorous
englishman
closet
study
of
a
prolonged
and
bitter
struggle
the
conflict
in
henry
ii
time
between
the
church
and
the
crown
as
exhibited
in
the
person
and
dominant
ecclesiastical
attitude
of
the
audacious
prelate
who
met
his
tragic
end
by
canterbury
altar
harold
strikingly
realizes
to
the
modern
reader
the
stirring
activities
of
a
strenuous
time
that
of
the
english
conquest
by
norman
william
opposed
to
the
death
by
harold
at
senlac
in
the
drama
is
as
rich
in
character
as
it
is
swift
and
energetic
in
action
queen
mary
deals
with
the
religious
and
political
dissensions
the
struggle
between
the
papacy
and
the
reformation
of
mary
era
with
her
love
for
and
marriage
with
philip
of
spain
and
her
hopeless
yearning
for
an
heir
to
the
double
crown
of
england
and
spain
an
important
and
prized
addition
to
our
english
literature
the
drama
undoubtedly
is
but
it
is
not
more
than
a
careful
accurate
and
elaborate
historical
study
it
lacks
both
in
spirit
and
movement
the
characteristics
of
the
shakespearian
drama
its
characters
however
are
vividly
brought
out
and
its
situations
are
often
picturesque
and
telling
the
personages
moreover
are
wanting
in
the
play
of
creative
effect
and
the
incidents
lack
the
stir
of
inventive
resource
further
though
the
story
of
mary
life
is
essentially
dramatic
and
the
incidents
of
her
reign
are
tragic
in
the
extreme
the
poet
does
not
seem
to
have
extracted
from
either
that
which
goes
to
the
making
of
a
great
drama
this
evidently
is
the
result
of
following
too
faithfully
the
events
of
history
and
the
records
of
the
time
as
well
as
in
some
degree
from
want
of
sympathy
which
tennyson
could
not
impart
with
the
leading
characters
and
their
actions
still
much
is
made
of
the
materials
and
though
the
personages
and
incidents
appear
in
the
narrative
in
the
neutral
tints
of
history
yet
the
period
is
made
to
reappear
with
a
freshness
and
distinctness
which
while
it
satisfies
the
scholar
gives
a
true
charm
to
every
lover
of
the
drama
again
and
again
as
we
read
are
we
reminded
of
the
laureate
rare
poetical
fancy
and
fine
literary
instinct
and
the
dialogues
contain
many
passages
of
striking
thought
and
noble
utterance
but
the
work
is
overcast
by
the
great
gloom
of
its
central
figure
the
gloom
of
bigotry
passion
jealousy
disappointment
and
despair
which
ever
environs
the
miserable
queen
and
much
though
the
poet
has
striven
to
brighten
the
picture
and
awaken
sympathy
for
the
weakness
of
the
woman
who
royal
mistress
though
she
was
could
not
command
her
love
to
be
requited
the
poetic
measure
of
his
lines
roughens
and
hardens
to
the
close
when
the
curtain
falls
on
what
is
felt
to
be
a
tragic
and
unlovely
life
we
can
only
briefly
refer
to
the
other
introduced
to
us
who
are
among
the
notable
historical
characters
that
figure
during
mary
tudor
reign
they
are
those
who
take
part
in
the
incidents
religious
civil
and
political
of
the
period
and
are
for
the
most
part
both
in
speech
and
bearing
the
portraits
familiar
to
us
in
froude
history
of
these
the
most
pleasing
is
the
princess
elizabeth
whose
portrait
is
drawn
with
masterly
skill
and
engages
our
interest
as
the
fortunes
of
its
original
oscillates
axe
and
crown
a
tudor
schooled
by
the
shadow
of
death
a
boleyn
too
glancing
across
the
tudor
but
aside
from
the
interest
in
the
safety
of
her
person
which
is
in
constant
jeopardy
from
the
jealousy
of
her
elizabeth
wins
upon
the
reader
by
her
modest
maidenly
bearing
her
frankness
of
manner
and
by
a
playfulness
of
disposition
which
readily
adapts
itself
to
the
restraints
which
the
queen
is
ever
placing
upon
her
person
and
which
endears
her
to
the
people
who
could
the
hated
mary
be
got
rid
of
would
fain
become
her
subjects
the
civil
strife
of
the
period
furnishes
material
for
some
powerful
passages
which
are
wrought
up
with
excellent
effect
and
in
this
connection
sir
thomas
wyatt
sir
thomas
stafford
the
earl
of
devon
sir
william
cecil
and
other
historical
personages
appear
upon
the
stage
the
other
incidents
introduced
are
those
which
attach
themselves
to
the
religious
persecutions
of
the
time
and
which
brought
cranmer
to
the
stake
and
give
play
to
the
papal
intrigues
of
pole
gardiner
and
the
emissaries
of
the
spanish
court
the
second
and
third
scenes
in
the
fourth
act
devoted
to
cranmer
which
detail
his
martyrdom
are
hardly
so
satisfactory
as
we
think
they
might
have
been
though
the
poet
here
again
follows
closely
the
historical
accounts
the
scenes
however
give
occasion
for
the
introduction
of
a
couple
of
local
gossips
whose
provincial
dialect
and
keen
interest
in
the
national
and
religious
policy
of
the
time
here
as
in
occasional
street
scenes
are
cleverly
portrayed
this
sapient
reflection
in
the
mouth
of
one
of
these
gossips
tib
is
a
specimen
at
hand
and
and
o

and

out
this

for

and
iver
philip
we
have
not
spoken
of
but
he
fills
such
a
hateful
niche
in
the
historical
gallery
of
the
time
and
the
poet
introduces
him
but
to
act
his
pitiful
role
that
we
pass
him
by
though
many
of
the
grandest
passages
in
the
drama
are
those
which
give
expression
to
passionate
love
for
him
and
her
longing
desire
for
an
issue
of
their
marriage
which
afterwards
culminates
in
her
madness
and
death
we
have
to
speak
of
but
one
other
character
in
the
drama
whose
death
it
has
been
said
was
sufficient
to
honor
and
to
dishonor
an
age
the
beautiful
lady
jane
grey
appears
for
a
little
among
the
shadows
of
the
poem
and
moves
to
her
tragic
fate
seventeen
a
rose
of
grace
girl
never
breathed
to
rival
such
a
rose
rose
never
blew
that
equalled
such
a
bud
a
few
songs
of
genuine
tennysonian
harmony
pitched
in
the
keys
that
most
fittingly
suit
the
singer
mood
are
interspersed
through
the
drama
and
serve
to
relieve
the
narratives
of
their
gloom
and
plaint
their
presence
we
can
not
help
thinking
recalls
work
better
done
and
more
within
the
limitations
of
the
poet
genius
than
this
drama
of
queen
mary
as
a
dramatic
representation
the
drama
had
the
advantage
of
being
produced
at
the
lyceum
theatre
london
with
all
the
historic
art
and
sumptuous
with
which
sir
henry
irving
could
well
give
it
irving
himself
personating
philip
while
miss
bateman
took
the
part
of
queen
mary
becket
we
should
here
add
was
also
given
on
the
stage
and
with
much
dramatic
effectiveness
by
irving
over
fifty
performances
of
it
being
called
for
none
of
the
dramas
however
as
we
have
said
was
a
success
though
each
has
its
merit
while
all
are
distinguished
by
many
passages
of
noble
and
strenuous
thought
other
dramatic
compositions
the
poet
attempted
though
of
minor
importance
to
the
trilogy
just
spoken
of
these
were
the
falcon
the
groundwork
of
which
is
to
be
found
in
the
decameron
the
cup
a
tragedy
rich
in
action
with
an
incisive
dialogue
borrowed
from
plutarch
the
former
was
staged
by
and
kendal
and
had
a
run
of
nights
the
latter
also
was
staged
with
liberal
magnificence
by
irving
and
met
with
considerable
success
the
promise
of
may
is
another
play
which
was
staged
in
by
bernard
beere
but
met
with
failure
by
the
critics
owing
in
some
degree
to
its
supposed
caricature
of
modern
agnostics
and
to
the
repellent
portrayal
of
one
of
the
characters
in
the
piece
the
sensualist
philip
edgar
later
in
appeared
the
foresters
a
pretty
pastoral
play
on
the
theme
of
robin
hood
and
maid
marian
which
was
produced
on
the
boards
in
new
york
by
daly
and
his
company
with
a
charming
woodland
setting
the
later
publications
of
the
laureate
in
his
own
distinctive
field
of
verse
embrace
the
lover
tale
ballads
and
other
poems
tiresias
and
other
poems
locksley
hall
sixty
years
after
demeter
and
other
poems
and
the
death
of
oenone
akbar
dream
and
other
poems
in
the
year
of
the
poet
death
in
these
various
volumes
there
is
much
admirable
work
and
many
tuneful
lyrics
in
the
old
charming
lilting
strain
with
not
a
few
serious
thoughtful
stately
pieces
of
verse
the
as
stedman
phrases
it
of
a
still
radiant
genius
his
continues
this
fine
critic
does
not
wreak
itself
upon
the
master
passions
of
love
and
ambition
and
hence
fastens
less
strongly
on
the
thoughts
of
the
young
nor
does
it
come
with
the
unused
rhythm
the
fresh
and
novel
cadence
that
stamped
the
now
hackneyed
measure
with
a
lyric
name
yet
as
to
its
art
and
imagery
the
same
effects
are
there
differing
only
in
a
more
vigorous
method
an
intentional
roughness
from
the
individual
early
verse
the
new
burthen
is
termed
pessimistic
but
for
all
its
impatient
summary
of
ills
it
ends
with
a
cry
of
faith
we
must
now
hasten
to
a
close
delightful
as
it
would
be
to
linger
over
so
attractive
a
theme
and
to
dwell
upon
the
personality
of
one
who
so
uniquely
represents
the
mind
as
he
has
so
remarkably
influenced
the
thought
of
his
age
but
considering
the
length
of
the
present
paper
this
can
not
be
happily
however
the
fruitage
is
ever
with
us
of
the
poet
full
fourscore
years
of
splendid
achievement
with
the
hallowing
memory
of
a
forceful
opulent
and
blameless
life
to
few
men
of
the
past
century
can
the
reflecting
mind
of
a
coming
time
more
interestingly
or
more
instructively
turn
than
to
this
profound
thinker
and
mighty
musical
singer
steeped
as
he
was
in
the
varied
culture
of
the
ages
endowed
with
great
prophetic
powers
with
phenomenal
gifts
of
poetic
expression
and
with
a
soul
so
attuned
to
the
harmonies
of
heaven
as
to
make
him
at
once
the
counsellor
and
the
inspiring
teacher
of
his
time
who
in
comparison
with
him
has
so
felt
the
subtle
charm
or
so
interpreted
to
us
the
infinite
beauty
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
or
more
impressively
deepened
in
the
mind
and
conscience
of
the
age
belief
in
the
verities
of
religion
while
quelling
its
doubts
and
quickening
its
highest
hopes
and
faith
tennyson
was
a
passionate
believer
in
the
immortal
life
this
was
so
real
to
him
that
he
had
no
patience
with
scepticism
on
the
subject
to
question
it
in
his
presence
was
to
bring
upon
one
head
a
torrent
of
denunciation
and
wrath
his
great
soul
was
intuitively
conscious
of
spiritual
realities
and
he
could
not
understand
how
little
soulless
microbes
of
men
and
women
were
destitute
of
his
deep
perception
prayer
was
to
him
a
living
fact
and
power
and
some
of
his
words
about
it
are
among
the
noblest
ever
written
when
some
one
asked
him
about
christ
he
pointed
to
a
flower
and
said
the
sun
is
to
that
flower
christ
is
to
my
soul
apart
as
he
stood
from
the
tumult
and
the
frivolities
of
his
age
he
was
yet
of
it
and
sensibly
and
beneficently
influenced
it
for
its
higher
and
nobler
weal
in
politics
as
we
know
he
was
a
liberal
conservative
a
conserver
of
what
was
best
in
the
present
and
the
past
and
an
advancer
of
all
that
tended
to
true
and
harmonious
progress
his
knowledge
of
men
and
things
was
wide
and
deep
in
the
philosophic
thought
and
even
in
the
science
of
his
time
he
was
deeply
read
while
he
was
lovingly
interested
in
all
nature
and
especially
in
the
common
people
whom
he
often
wrote
of
and
touchingly
depicted
in
their
humble
ways
of
toil
as
well
as
of
joy
and
sorrow
above
all
he
was
a
man
of
high
and
real
faith
who
believed
that
good
was
the
final
goal
of
ill
and
in
the
dumb
hour
clothed
in
black
that
at
last
came
to
him
as
it
comes
to
all
he
confidingly
put
his
trust
in
loving
omnipotence
and
reverently
and
beautifully
expressed
the
hope
of
seeing
the
guiding
pilot
of
his
life
when
with
the
outflow
of
its
into
the
ocean
of
the
divine
unseen
he
crossed
the
bar
for
humanity
sake
and
the
weal
of
the
world
in
a
coming
time
this
was
his
joyous
cry
ring
in
the
nobler
modes
of
life
with
sweeter
manners
purer
laws
ring
in
the
love
of
truth
and
right
ring
in
the
common
love
of
good
ring
in
the
valiant
man
and
free
the
larger
heart
the
kindlier
hand
ring
out
the
darkness
of
the
land
ring
in
the
christ
that
is
to
be
what
our
formative
english
literature
has
suffered
in
tennyson
passing
from
the
age
on
which
he
has
shed
so
much
glory
those
can
best
say
who
are
of
his
era
and
have
been
intimate
as
each
appeared
with
every
successive
issue
of
his
works
to
the
latter
as
to
all
thoughtful
students
of
his
writings
his
has
been
the
supreme
interpreting
voice
of
the
past
century
while
his
influence
on
the
literary
thought
of
his
time
has
been
of
the
highest
and
most
potent
kind
especially
influential
has
tennyson
been
in
carrying
forward
with
new
impulses
and
inspiration
the
poetic
traditions
of
that
grand
old
motherland
of
english
song
to
which
our
own
poets
in
the
new
world
as
well
as
the
younger
bards
of
the
british
isles
owe
so
much
if
we
except
the
laureate
there
have
been
few
who
have
worn
the
singing
robe
of
the
poet
who
in
these
later
years
at
least
have
spoken
so
impressively
to
cultured
minds
on
either
side
of
the
ocean
or
have
more
effectively
expressed
to
his
age
the
high
and
hallowing
spirit
of
modern
poetry
it
is
this
that
has
given
the
laureate
his
exalted
place
among
the
great
literary
influences
of
the
century
and
made
him
the
one
indubitable
representative
of
english
song
with
all
its
tuneful
music
and
rare
and
delicate
art
to
a
few
of
the
great
choir
of
singers
of
the
past
tennyson
admittedly
owed
something
both
in
tradition
and
in
art
for
each
new
impulse
has
caught
and
embodied
not
a
little
of
the
spirit
and
temper
as
well
as
the
culture
and
inspiration
of
the
old
but
his
it
was
to
impart
new
and
fresher
thought
and
a
wider
range
of
harmony
and
emotion
than
had
been
reached
by
almost
any
of
his
predecessors
and
to
speak
to
the
mind
and
soul
of
his
time
as
none
other
has
spoken
or
could
well
speak
from
the
era
of
shakespeare
and
milton
and
their
chief
successors
it
is
to
tennyson
honor
