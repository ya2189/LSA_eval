printed
for
the
navarre
society
in
great
introduction
the
restoration
brought
back
to
england
something
more
than
a
king
and
the
theatre
it
renewed
in
english
life
the
robust
vitality
of
humour
which
had
been
repressed
under
the
commonwealth
though
in
spite
of
repression
there
were
even
among
the
puritan
divines
men
like
the
author
of
whose
ran
the
whole
gamut
from
freedom
to
licentiousness
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
fundamental
english
humour
it
can
be
vividly
concentrated
into
a
single
word
as
when
for
instance
the
chronicler
of
ten
pleasures
of
revives
the
opprobrious
term
for
a
tailor
pricklouse
the
whole
history
of
the
english
woollen
industry
and
of
the
stuffy
tudor
and
stuart
domestic
architecture
is
in
the
nickname
or
a
single
phrase
can
light
up
an
idea
as
when
a
few
days
before
marriage
the
bridegroom
is
running
up
and
down
like
a
dog
but
on
the
other
hand
the
spirit
manifests
itself
sometimes
in
exuberance
as
when
urquhart
and
motteux
metagrobolized
rabelais
into
something
almost
more
tumescent
and
overwhelming
than
the
original
in
that
vein
of
humour
the
present
work
frequently
runs
the
author
is
as
ready
to
pile
up
his
epithets
as
urquhart
himself
let
the
nurse
go
he
says
for
then
you
have
an
eater
a
a
stufgut
a
and
less
than
you
had
before
it
is
in
fact
as
an
example
of
english
humour
exaggerated
no
doubt
by
the
reaction
from
puritanism
that
ten
pleasures
of
should
be
viewed
in
the
main
it
is
true
however
that
it
is
of
uncertain
parentage
and
must
own
to
foreign
kin
a
but
by
a
strange
coincidence
almost
equally
rare
book
is
antoine
de
la
salle
joies
de
it
seems
possible
that
this
was
translated
into
english
at
any
rate
in
the
year
in
which
ten
was
published
the
following
work
was
registered
at
stationers
hall
woman
advocate
or
fifteen
real
comforts
of
matrimony
being
in
requital
of
the
late
sham
moreover
ten
was
in
all
probability
printed
abroad
hazlitt
thinks
at
the
hague
or
amsterdam
the
very
first
page
in
the
original
edition
contains
one
of
several
hints
of
batavian
production
younger

the
curious
allusion
to
the
great
french
poet
cl√©ment
marot
may
also
suggest
a
temporary
foreign
sojourn
for
the
author
for
though
marot
was
doubtless
known
to
english
readers
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
exact
reference
of
the
allusion
is
not
at
all
obvious
it
very
possibly
reflects
on
the
fact
that
in
the
sorbonne
condemned
both
marot
and
his
poem
de
et
de
la
femme
and
marot
certainly
wrote
about
women
and
marriage
he
is
not
however
a
stock
figure
in
english
literary
allusion
either
learned
or
popular
and
the
fact
suggests
at
least
familiarity
with
the
literature
of
other
countries
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
english
character
of
the
text
both
in
general
and
in
detail
it
is
redolent
of
english
life
as
it
was
in
the
days
before
our
grandfathers
decided
that
the
human
body
was
an
obscene
thing
and
its
functions
deplorable
it
has
the
love
of
good
food
colchester
oysters
famous
then
as
now
asparagus
peaches
apricots
candied
ginger
china
oranges
comfits
pancakes
enough
to
make
the
mouth
water
it
has
the
solid
english
furniture
with
all
its
ritual
of
solemnity
vallians
valences
daslles
tassels
big
bedsteads
plush
chairs
linen
cupboards
it
has
all
the
fuss
of
preparation
for
childbirth
the
accumulations
of
wrappings
the
obstetric
furniture
the
nods
and
winks
of
the
midwife
and
the
gossips
authentic
ancestors
of
mrs
sarah
gamp
and
mrs
elizabeth
prig
why
the
haste
to
fetch
the
midwife
at
the
crisis
might
almost
be
the
foundation
upon
which
dickens
built
the
visit
of
seth
pecksniff
to
kingsgate
street
high
holborn
it
has
likewise
many
touches
which
show
knowledge
of
the
average
fairly
prosperous
english
life
the
merchant
the
shopkeeper
the
the
author
clearly
knew
the
routine
of
trade
he
knew
that
at
new
year
day
the
had
to
be
fully
written
up
for
scrutiny
and
and
sending
out
of
accounts
but
the
pleasures
or
torments
of
love
are
such
that
the
squire
is
so
full
of
business
that
he
ca
spare
to
write
it
out
the
brief
description
of
his
feelings
which
follows
conventional
perhaps
to
some
extent
has
a
certain
life
in
it
as
if
the
writer
embittered
was
recalling
his
own
youthful
experience
he
knew
too
what
we
only
know
in
the
mass
through
the
newspapers
that
a
business
depends
not
only
upon
watching
the
markets
but
upon
the
actual
supply
of
material
what
commodities
are
arrived
or
expected
and
whether
tea
is
up
or
tin
down
or
if
hogs
closed
firm
the
commercial
world
changes
only
its
methods
of
communication
and
expression
the
first
chapter
indeed
is
of
genuine
historical
and
literary
interest
from
the
literary
point
of
view
it
is
a
near
descendant
collateral
if
not
direct
and
anyhow
based
on
the
same
english
empirical
humour
of
life
of
thomas
overbury
only
one
unique
copy
of
this
is
known
to
exist
john
in
prose
and
thomas
in
verse
it
is
an
early
instance
of
the
stringing
together
in
a
connected
narrative
of
the
material
previously
used
only
in
short
sketches
or
characters
and
so
it
is
directly
in
the
succession
which
in
the
end
produced
what
is
perhaps
the
most
enduring
and
individual
phenomenon
in
our
literature
the
english
novel
a
copy
of
the
very
rare
first
edition
fetched
at
the
britwell
sale
in
february
of
course
the
book
says
things
we
do
not
say
now
openly
though
the
traditional
scriptorum
nondum
which
almost
all
men
and
even
some
women
know
is
handed
on
a
rather
noisome
torch
from
generation
to
generation
solely
by
word
of
mouth
and
flickers
now
and
again
in
ten
but
they
were
said
openly
then
and
by
great
writers
there
is
nothing
here
so
nauseatingly
indecent
as
the
viler
poems
of
the
rev
robert
herrick
and
the
very
rev
the
dean
of
dublin
jonathan
swift
there
are
salacious
hints
there
are
bawdy
words
but
no
more
than
falstaff
or
the
wife
of
bath
or
the
summoner
or
tom
jones
might
have
used
less
on
the
whole
there
is
no
need
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
the
book
sequel
to
make
use
of
the
gesture
of
casting
up
the
whites
of
the
eyes
souls
will
solace
their
spirits
with
a
little
laughter
and
never
busy
their
brains
with
the
subversion
of
church
and
state
government
certainly
the
writer
favoured
the
jovial
life
food
and
wine
flow
in
his
pages
like
milk
and
honey
in
canaan
there
is
no
room
in
his
house
for
the
puritans
not
even
apparently
in
the
bringing
up
of
his
child
those
that
frequent
mr
baxter
puritanical
must
be
merry
when
they
come
to
his
feast
he
will
have
no
of
a
discourse
published
by
richard
baxter
in
this
very
year
and
the
only
a
baxter
pamphlet
of
he
is
likely
to
offer
to
young
men
is
to
take
life
lightly
as
his
hero
does
and
above
all
not
to
marry
for
that
is
the
true
point
of
this
lively
piece
of
irony
the
irony
is
less
well
sustained
in
the
sequel
confession
of
the
new
married
and
dropped
altogether
in
the
bitter
at
the
end
of
ten
it
is
a
savage
attack
upon
women
upon
to
quote
a
rabelaisian
sentence
the
quarrelsome
crabbed
lavish
proud
opinionated
domineering
and
unbridled
nature
of
the
female
sex
women
he
says
are
in
effect
of
less
value
than
old
iron
boots
and
shoes
for
we
find
both
merchants
and
money
ready
always
to
buy
those
commodities
the
analogy
is
an
unfortunate
one
for
one
of
his
implications
is
that
women
can
easily
be
bought
but
he
if
it
is
a
he
is
in
deadly
earnest
love
marriage
he
asks
scornfully
what
are
they
a
romance
are
they
the
true
happiness
of
life
very
well
here
are
the
pleasures
of
them
you
will
be
in
love
and
make
a
match
and
look
at
all
the
worry
of
the
settlement
in
which
by
the
way
you
may
often
be
defrauded
you
will
get
married
a
fine
ceremony
with
a
fine
feast
and
all
the
nasty
old
women
of
the
neighbourhood
will
come
and
tell
bawdy
stories
to
enliven
the
occasion
you
get
married
and
thereafter
you
are
at
the
mercy
of
your
wife
who
will
indulge
your
wishes
or
not
as
suits
her
mood
your
house
will
be
all
awry
if
she
has
but
a
slight
headache
when
the
baby
comes
the
place
will
be
filled
with
old
women
and
and
medical
apparatus
and
you
will
have
all
the
anxieties
of
a
father
added
to
the
discomforts
of
a
neglected
husband
for
the
rest
your
wife
will
know
how
to
cuckold
jilt
and
sham
as
well
as
any
gay
lady
of
covent
garden
and
so
on
much
of
the
satire
is
acute
and
often
novel
in
expression
if
not
in
thought
but
it
is
as
has
been
suggested
in
the
picture
of
english
life
under
james
ii
that
the
importance
of
the
book
lies
here
is
the
domestic
side
of
what
the
great
diarists
and
the
great
poets
hint
at
and
the
excess
of
which
municipal
records
those
treasuries
of
private
appearances
in
public
chronicle
with
the
severity
of
judgment
you
have
the
young
couple
going
alas
that
the
river
for
this
purpose
has
so
to
speak
been
moved
farther
up
its
own
course
for
a
row
on
the
thames
with
lambeth
bankside
and
southwark
echoing
to
their
laughter
they
might
visit
the
new
spring
gardens
at
vauxhall
but
they
would
probably
avoid
the
old
second
globe
theatre
on
bankside
for
it
was
a
at
which
the
formidable
baxter
preached
or
they
might
go
into
kent
and
pick
fruit
even
as
beanfeasters
do
to
this
day
or
to
hereford
for
its
cider
and
perry
the
drinking
of
which
is
a
custom
not
yet
extinct
or
maybe
only
for
an
outing
to
the
pleasant
village
of
hackney
they
would
see
the
streets
gay
with
signs
which
outside
lombard
street
few
houses
but
taverns
wear
the
sign
of
the
or
the
or
that
fantastic
schoolmaster
emblem
the
with
a
crown
upon
it
and
when
they
stopped
for
rest
at
the
sign
of
a
bush
upon
a
pole
how
they
would
fall
to
upon
the
martinmas
beef
the
the
cheesecakes
it
is
true
they
might
find
prices
high
and
crops
poor
but
such
things
must
be
this

the
use

and
fruits
of

high

learnt
that
as
long
ago
as
as

the

not

rather
is
it

also
being

only
in
such
works
as

in

exceptionally
important
from
a
point
of
view
it
is
of
the
utmost
rarity
there
is
no
copy
in
the
british
museum
and
none
in
the
cambridge

library
in
fact
there
are
only
two
copies
known
of
the
whole

in

that
from
which
the

is
taken

a
copy
of
the
first
part
only
both

fuller
copies
contain
the
second
part

evidently
the
two
parts

they

be
that

licentious

preface
and
epilogue
to

bitterly
of
those
who
would
not
go
to
her
plays
because
they
were
by
a
woman
on
the
other
hand
she
had
a
free
pen
to
say
the
least
of
it

often
a
witty

as
the
little
volume
here
privately
reprinted
by

is
surely
proof
most
positive
the

small
thick

fortunately
however
for
our
literature
and
for
students

it
was
seen
by

the
literary
interest
of
the
book
which
presents
pictures
of
the
cit
and
his
wife
at
work
and
play
which
fielding
had
he
lived
in
the
seventeenth
century
might
have
written
it
is
thought
that
the
book
was
printed
in
holland
and
if
so
it
may
well
be
that
the
ship
carrying
the
printed
sheets
to
england
foundered
in
the
north
sea
or
was
sunk
by
enemy
craft
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
such
a
work
would
not
have
escaped
the
wits
of
the
time
if
it
had
survived
for
ordinary
circulation
mention
would
have
been
made
of
it
however
small
an
edition
had
been
sold
no
other
so
likely
reason
for
its
extreme
rarity
presents
itself
it
is
reprinted
as
faithfully
as
the
altered
manners
of
our
time
permit
with
a
preface
by
john
harvey
who
attributes
the
work
to
the
industrious
and
sometimes
brilliant
mrs
aphra
behn
a
discovery
which
the
navarre
society
believe
to
be
well
grounded
they
hope
that
the
issue
of
the
book
to
their
subscribers
may
help
to
confirm
or
refute
that
lady
responsibility
for
so
graceless
an
attack
upon
her
sex
whether
she
did
or
did
not
write
it
the
fact
remains
that
a
work
so
vividly
representative
of
restoration
life
and
literature
is
rescued
from
the
obscurity
to
which
its
scarceness
has
hitherto
condemned
it
and
worthily
preserved
for
scholars
and
amateurs
of
the
future
the
ten
pleasures
of
marriage
the
ten
pleasures
of

all
the
delights
and
contentments
that
are
mask
under
the
bands
of
matrimony
written

printed
in
the
year
to
the
reader
courteous
reader
small
treatise
which
i
here
present
unto
thee
is
the
fruit
of
some
spare
hours
that
my
cogitations
after
they
had
been
for
a
small
time
between
whiles
hovering
to
and
fro
in
the
air
came
fluttring
down
again
still
pitching
upon
the
subject
of
the
ten
pleasures
of
marriage
in
each
of
which
i
hope
thou
wilt
find
somthing
worthy
of
thy
acceptance
because
i
am
sure
is
matter
of
such
nature
as
hath
never
before
been
extant
and
especially
in
such
a
method
neither
canst
thou
well
expect
it
to
be
drest
up
in
any
thing
of
nice
and
neat
words
as
other
subjects
may
be
but
only
to
be
clad
in
plain
habit
most
fit
for
the
humour
of
the
fancy
if
i
perceive
that
it
please
thee
and
is
not
roughly
or
unkindly
dealt
withall
nor
brain
in
the
nativity
to
spoil
its
generation
of
a
further
product
it
will
incourage
me
to
proceed
upon
a
second
part
some
say
of
the
tune
i
mean
to
the
purpose
apparelled
very
near
the
same
dress
in
the
mean
time
with
hopes
that
thou
wilt
be
kind
to
this
and
give
it
a
gentle
reception
from
him
who
is
thine
the
ten
pleasures
of
marriage
the
nuptial
estate
trailing
along
with
it
so
many
cares
troubles
calamities
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
admirations
that
people
should
be
so
earnest
and
desirous
to
enter
themselves
into
it
in
the
younger
sort
who
by
their
sulphurous
instinct
are
subject
to
the
tickling
desires
of
nature
and
look
upon
that
thing
called
love
through
a
multiplying
glass
it
is
somewhat
pardonable
but
that
those
who
are
once
come
to
the
years
of
knowledge
and
true
understanding
should
be
drawn
into
it
methinks
is
most
vilely
foolish
and
morrice
fooles
caps
were
much
fitter
for
them
then
wreaths
of
lawrel
yet
stranger
it
is
that
those
who
have
been
for
the
first
time
in
that
horrible
estate
do
by
a
decease
cast
themselves
in
again
to
a
second
and
third
time
truly
if
for
once
any
one
be
through
contrary
imaginations
misled
he
may
expect
some
hopes
of
compassion
and
alledge
some
reasons
to
excuse
himself
but
what
comfort
or
compassion
can
they
look
for
that
have
thrown
themselves
in
a
second
and
third
time
they
were
happy
if
they
could
keep
their
lips
from
speaking
and
ty
their
tongues
from
complaining
that
their
miseries
might
not
be
more
and
more
burdened
with
scoffings
which
they
truly
merit
and
tho
not
only
the
real
truth
of
this
but
ten
times
more
is
as
well
known
to
every
one
as
the
sun
shine
at
noon
day
nevertheless
we
see
them
run
into
it
with
such
an
earnestness
that
they
are
not
to
be
counselled
or
kept
back
from
it
with
the
strength
of
despising
their
golden
liberty
for
chains
of
horrid
slavery
but
we
see
the
bravest
sparks
in
the
very
blossoming
of
their
youth
how
they
decay
first
they
take
pleasure
in
all
manner
of
noble
exercises
as
in
keeping
time
all
dancing
singing
of
musick
playing
upon
instruments
speaking
of
several
languages
studying
at
the
best
universities
and
conversing
with
the
learnedst
doctors
or
else
we
see
them
before
they
are
half
perfect
in
any
exercise
like
in
march
run
mewing
and
yawling
at
the
doors
of
young
gentlewomen
and
if
any
of
those
have
but
a
small
matter
of
more
then
ordinary
beauty
which
perhaps
is
gotten
by
the
help
of
a
damn
bewitched
pot
of
paint
she
is
immediately
ador
like
a
saint
upon
an
altar
and
in
an
instant
there
is
as
much
beauty
and
perfection
to
be
seen
in
her
as
ever
juno
venus
and
pallas
possessed
all
together
and
herewith
those
gentile
pleasures
that
have
cost
their
parents
so
much
money
and
them
so
much
labour
and
time
are
kickt
away
and
totally
abandoned
that
they
may
keep
company
with
a
painted
jezebel
they
are
then
hardly
arrived
at
this
intitled
happiness
but
they
must
begin
to
chaw
upon
the
bitter
shell
of
that
nut
the
kernel
whereof
without
sighing
they
can
not
tast
having
no
sooner
obtained
access
to
the
lady
but
are
as
suddenly
possest
with
thousands
of
thoughts
what
they
shall
do
to
please
the
sweet
object
being
therewith
so
tosticated
that
all
their
other
business
is
dispersed
and
totally
laid
aside
this
is
observable
not
only
in
youth
of
the
first
degree
but
also
in
persons
that
have
received
promotion
for
if
he
be
a
theologue
his
books
drop
out
of
his
hands
and
ly
stragling
about
his
study
even
as
his
sences
do
one
among
another
and
if
you
hear
him
preach
his
whole
sermon
is
nothing
but
of
love
which
he
then
turns
winds
to
divinity
as
far
as
possible
it
can
be
fitted
if
it
be
a
doctor
of
physick
oh
he
has
so
much
work
with
his
own
sicknes
that
he
absolutely
forgets
all
his
patients
though
some
of
them
were
lying
at
deaths
dore
and
lets
the
chyrurgian
whom
he
had
appointed
certainly
to
meet
there
tarry
to
no
purpose
taking
no
more
notice
of
his
patients
misery
and
the
peril
of
his
wounds
then
if
it
did
not
concern
him
but
if
at
last
he
doth
come
it
is
when
the
wound
festered
the
ague
in
the
blood
or
that
the
body
is
incurable
so
far
was
he
concern
in
looking
after
that
or
for
the
cure
of
his
own
burning
distemper
if
he
be
a
counsellor
his
whole
brain
is
so
much
puzzel
how
to
begin
and
pursue
the
process
for
the
obtaining
his
mistress
in
marriage
that
all
other
suits
tho
they
be
to
the
great
detriment
of
poor
widows
and
orphans
are
laid
aside
and
wholly
rejected
then
being
desired
by
his
clients
to
meet
them
at
anyplace
and
to
give
his
advice
concerning
the
cause
he
hath
had
such
earnest
business
with
his
mistress
that
he
comes
an
hour
or
two
later
then
was
appointed
but
coming
at
last
one
half
of
the
time
that
can
be
spent
is
little
enough
to
make
counsellor
understand
in
what
state
the
cause
stood
at
the
last
meeting
and
then
having
heard
what
the
plaintif
and
defendant
do
say
he
only
tells
them
i
must
have
clearer
evidences
the
accounts
better
adjusted
and
your
demand
in
writing
before
i
can
make
any
decision
of
this
cause
to
both
your
satisfactions
there
they
stand
then
and
look
one
upon
another
not
daring
to
say
otherwise
but
very
well
sir
we
will
make
them
all
ready
against
the
next
and
are
with
grief
at
heart
forced
to
see
as
much
and
sometimes
more
expences
made
at
the
meeting
as
the
whole
concern
of
their
debate
amounted
to
then
it
is
come
let
now
discourse
of
matters
of
state
and
drink
a
glass
about
to
the
health
of
the
king
the
prosperity
of
our
country
and
all
the
inhabitants
which
is
done
only
to
the
purpose
that
coming
to
his
mistress
he
may
boastingly
say
my
dear
just
now
at
a
meeting
we
remembered
you
in
a
glass
swear
the
least
drop
of
it
was
so
delicious
to
me
as
ever
and
could
be
that
the
poets
so
highly
commend
if
counsellors
and
other
learned
men
that
are
in
love
do
thus
what
can
the
unlearned
notary
do
less
even
nothing
else
but
when
they
are
writing
scribble
up
a
multiplicity
of
several
words
unnecessary
clauses
and
make
long
periods
not
so
much
as
touching
or
mentioning
the
principal
business
and
if
he
does
writes
it
clear
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
party
concern
by
that
means
making
both
wills
and
other
deeds
in
such
a
manner
that
the
end
agrees
not
with
the
beginning
nor
the
middle
with
either
which
occasions
between
friends
near
relations
and
neighbors
great
differences
and
an
implacable
hatred
forcing
thereby
the
monies
of
innocent
and
people
into
the
pockets
of
counsellors
and
attorneys
and
alas
the
diligent
merchant
when
he
has
gotten
the
least
smatch
of
this
frensie
his
head
runs
so
much
upon
wheels
that
he
daily
neglects
his
forgets
his
bils
of
exchange
and
is
alwaies
a
post
or
two
behind
hand
with
his
letters
so
that
he
knows
not
what
merchandises
rise
or
fall
or
what
commodities
are
arrived
or
expected
and
by
this
means
buies
in
wares
at
such
rates
that
in
few
daies
he
loses
yea
sometimes
per
cent
by
them
nay
this
distemper
is
so
hot
in
his
head
that
thereby
he
ships
his
goods
in
a
vessel
where
the
master
and
his
mate
are
for
the
most
part
drunk
and
who
hardly
thrice
in
ten
times
make
a
good
voyage
and
who
knows
not
how
miserable
that
city
and
country
is
when
a
military
person
happens
to
ly
sick
in
this
hospital
if
he
be
in
garison
he
doth
nothing
but
trick
up
himself
walk
along
the
streets
flatter
his
mistress
and
vaunt
of
his
knowledge
and
warlike
deeds
though
he
scarce
understands
the
exercising
of
his
arms
i
will
not
mention
encamping
in
a
field
fortification
the
forming
of
batalions
and
a
great
deal
more
that
belongs
to
him
and
coming
into
campagne
alas
this
wicked
continues
with
him
and
runs
so
through
his
blood
that
both
the
open
air
and
wide
fields
are
too
narrow
for
him
yea
and
tho
he
formerly
had
especially
by
his
mistris
the
name
of
behaving
himself
like
a
second
mars
yet
now
play
the
i
dare
not
say
the
to
the
end
he
may
having
put
on
his
fine
knotted
scarf
and
powdered
periwig
only
go
to
shew
himself
to
that
adorable
babe
his
lady
venus
leaving
oftentimes
a
desperate
siege
and
important
state
affairs
to
accompany
a
lame
and
and
if
by
favour
or
recommandation
he
happen
to
be
intrusted
with
any
strong
city
or
fort
that
is
besieged
he
presently
in
fear
of
his
own
bom
and
practises
all
sorts
of
waies
and
means
how
he
shall
best
make
a
capitulation
that
so
leaving
the
place
he
may
go
again
to
his
fair
one
and
alas
what
doth
not
the
master
of
a
ship
and
his
mate
hazard
when
they
are
sick
of
this
malady
what
terrible
colds
and
roaring
seas
doth
he
not
undergo
through
an
intemperate
desire
that
he
hath
to
be
with
his
nittebritch
peggy
how
often
doth
he
hazard
his
owners
ship
the
merchants
goods
and
his
own
life
for
an
inconstant
that
perhaps
before
he
has
been
three
daies
at
sea
hath
drawn
her
affection
from
him
and
given
promise
to
another
yet
nevertheless
tho
the
raging
waves
run
upon
the
ship
and
fly
over
his
head
he
withstands
it
all
nor
is
the
main
ocean
or
blustering
powerfull
enough
to
cool
his
raging
fire
and
drive
those
damps
out
of
his
brain
the
tempestuousness
of
the
weather
having
driven
him
far
out
of
his
course
his
only
wishes
and
prayer
is
oh
that
he
might
be
so
happy
but
for
a
moment
to
see
his
beacon
those
twinkling
eys
of
his
dearly
beloved
margery
mussel
then
all
things
would
be
well
enough
tho
he
and
all
that
are
with
him
were
immediately
shipwrackt
and
made
a
prey
for
the
fishes
and
if
unexpectedly
fortune
so
favour
him
that
he
happens
to
see
the
coast
oh
he
can
not
tarry
for
the
pilot
but
tho
it
be
misty
weather
and
he
hoodwink
by
venus
still
he
sails
forward
running
all
in
danger
that
before
was
so
far
preserved
and
if
the
once
sets
foot
into
this
destructive
wilderness
he
doth
nothing
less
then
look
to
his
shop
and
wait
upon
his
customers
spending
most
part
of
his
time
in
finical
dressing
himself
to
accompany
his
mistriss
and
with
a
coach
or
pair
of
oars
to
do
her
all
manner
of
caresses
then
his
whole
discourse
is
with
what
good
custom
he
is
blest
above
others
but
seldom
saies
that
with
waiting
upon
his
lady
and
by
indeavouring
to
please
her
above
all
things
how
miserably
he
neglects
it
by
which
means
shop
not
only
found
without
a
master
but
the
servants
without
government
and
at
the
is
not
written
fair
over
and
if
any
body
desires
their
reckoning
the
squire
is
so
full
of
business
that
he
ca
spare
half
an
hour
to
write
it
out
for
where
he
goes
where
he
stands
what
he
thinks
what
he
does
all
his
cogitations
are
to
think
how
delicious
it
is
to
press
those
soft
lips
of
his
beloved
and
then
out
of
an
unfeigned
heart
to
be
lov
again
sometimes
receiving
a
kiss
thus
he
idles
away
all
his
time
and
all
his
business
with
his
sences
runs
a
to
be
short
let
it
be
what
sort
of
person
it
will
they
no
sooner
touch
the
shell
of
this
but
before
they
can
come
to
tast
the
kernel
they
look
for
they
feel
nothing
else
then
thorns
and
briars
of
sorrow
and
misery
if
there
be
any
one
that
thinks
he
is
gotten
a
footstep
further
then
another
in
the
favour
of
his
mistriss
and
that
in
time
he
questions
not
th
obtaining
his
desired
happiness
immediately
that
imagined
joy
is
crush
with
an
insuing
despair
being
presently
molested
with
a
fear
that
father
mother
uncle
or
tutor
will
not
like
his
person
or
that
he
has
not
means
enough
or
else
either
they
or
the
gentlewoman
will
make
choice
of
another
in
his
place
or
if
he
sees
another
have
access
to
the
lady
as
well
as
himself
at
the
same
moment
he
possessed
with
jealousie
and
falls
a
pondering
how
he
shall
make
this
rival
odious
in
the
eys
of
her
and
if
the
other
get
any
advantage
of
him
then
he
challenges
him
to
fight
hazarding
in
that
manner
his
precious
life
for
the
getting
of
her
who
when
he
had
her
would
perhaps
occasion
him
a
thousand
torments
of
death
and
misery
pray
observe
what
pleasures
this
introduction
imparts
unto
us
alas
what
may
we
then
expect
from
the
marriage
it
self
really
those
that
will
take
this
into
due
consideration
who
would
not
but
curse
the
gentlewoman
that
draws
him
into
such
a
raging
madness
yet
lovers
go
forward
and
please
your
selves
with
this
imagined
happiness
but
know
that
if
according
to
your
hope
you
obtain
her
for
a
bride
that
at
the
least
you
must
expect
a
sence
and
feeling
of
the
ten
insuing
pleasures
illustration
folio
by
the
navarre
society
the
first
pleasure
consent
is
given
the
match
concluded
and
the
wedding
now
o
lover
till
this
time
you
have
been
indeavouring
slaving
turmoiling
sighing
groaning
hoping
and
begging
to
get
from
those
slow
and
tardy
lips
that
for
word
of
consent
you
have
also
sent
many
messengers
to
your
mistriss
to
her
parents
and
tutors
who
were
as
able
to
express
themselves
as
the
best
orators
but
could
obtain
nothing
yet
at
last
that
long
desired
word
is
once
descended
by
the
of
her
lips
like
a
rich
cordial
upon
your
languishing
heart
you
have
vanquish
all
your
rivals
oh
who
can
imagine
your
joy
what
you
think
or
what
you
do
still
your
thoughts
glance
upon
your
happiness
your
mistriss
now
will
be
willing
denials
are
laid
aside
only
ther
a
little
shame
and
fear
which
canot
of
a
sudden
be
so
totally
forgotten
because
the
marriage
is
not
yet
concluded
well
o
lover
who
could
desire
a
greater
happiness
then
you
now
possess
for
what
you
will
she
will
also
and
what
she
desires
is
all
your
pleasure
you
may
now
tumble
in
a
bed
of
lillies
and
roses
for
all
sour
looks
are
turn
to
sweet
smiles
and
she
that
used
to
thrust
you
from
her
pulls
you
now
every
foot
to
her
yea
those
breasts
which
before
you
durst
scarce
touch
with
your
little
finger
you
may
now
without
asking
leave
grasp
by
whole
handfuls
certainly
they
that
at
full
view
consider
all
this
rightly
who
can
doubt
but
that
you
are
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
o
unspeakable
pleasure
but
o
triumphant
lover
let
not
however
your
joyfull
mind
run
too
much
upon
these
glistering
things
be
a
little
moderate
in
your
desired
pleasures
if
it
might
happen
that
there
come
some
obstructions
for
i
have
oftentimes
seen
that
all
those
suspected
roses
come
forth
with
many
pricking
thorns
insomuch
that
the
mouth
which
at
first
was
saluted
with
so
many
thousand
kisses
and
appear
as
if
it
had
been
cover
with
the
dew
of
heaven
was
compared
to
be
the
jaws
of
and
those
breasts
which
before
were
the
curded
and
called
the
banket
of
the
gods
i
have
seen
despised
to
be
like
stinking
i
and
worse
names
to
boot
be
therefore
i
say
somewhat
moderate
and
prudent
for
fear
it
might
happen
that
the
prices
of
this
market
might
fall
very
suddenly
though
perhaps
not
so
horribly
nevertheless
you
have
great
reason
to
be
merry
for
this
week
is
hop
be
a
meeting
to
close
up
the
match
and
it
is
requisite
that
you
should
go
unto
all
the
friends
that
must
be
present
at
the
meeting
to
hear
when
their
occasions
will
permit
them
and
what
day
and
hour
they
will
appoint
to
set
upon
the
business
herewith
you
have
work
to
traverse
the
city
and
who
knows
whether
find
half
of
them
at
home
and
then
those
that
you
do
find
one
is
ready
to
day
another
to
morrow
a
third
next
day
or
in
the
next
week
so
that
by
this
first
pleasure
you
have
also
a
little
feeling
of
the
first
trouble
which
if
you
rightly
consider
is
to
your
advantage
because
you
may
the
better
use
your
self
to
the
following
and
of
how
greater
state
and
quality
the
person
is
whom
you
have
chosen
so
accordingly
this
trouble
generally
happens
to
be
more
but
the
mirth
increases
abundantly
when
after
your
indeavours
troubles
and
turmoils
you
finally
see
all
the
friends
met
together
and
you
doubt
not
but
the
match
will
be
closed
and
agreed
upon
but
be
here
also
a
little
moderate
in
your
mirth
because
oftentimes
the
friends
handle
this
matter
like
a
bargaining
and
will
lay
the
mony
bags
of
each
side
in
a
balance
as
you
may
see
by
the
plate
in
the
mean
while
you
may
be
kissing
and
slabbering
of
your
mistris
in
the
next
room
or
contriving
what
to
be
done
about
the
marriage
and
keeping
of
the
wedding
but
perhaps
through
the
discord
of
the
friends
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
are
disturb
the
differences
oft
rising
so
high
that
the
sound
thereof
clatters
through
the
walls
into
the
ears
of
the
lovers
for
many
times
the
portion
of
one
is
too
great
and
what
given
with
the
other
is
too
little
or
that
the
parents
of
the
bridegroom
promise
too
little
with
their
son
and
the
brides
parents
will
give
too
little
with
their
daughter
or
else
that
by
some
subtle
contract
of
matrimony
they
indeavour
to
make
the
goods
of
each
side
disinheritable
so
that
it
appears
among
the
friends
as
if
there
could
be
nothing
don
in
the
matter
and
in
plain
truth
the
parents
and
friends
who
know
very
well
that
it
is
not
all
hony
in
the
married
estate
see
oftentimes
that
it
were
better
for
these
two
to
remain
unmarried
then
to
bring
each
other
into
misery
and
can
find
no
grounds
or
reasons
but
rather
to
disswade
then
perswade
the
young
folks
to
a
marriage
but
tho
on
each
side
they
use
never
such
powerfull
arguments
to
the
young
people
is
to
no
purpose
for
there
fire
in
the
flax
and
go
how
it
will
it
must
be
quencht
for
the
maid
thinks
if
this
match
should
be
broke
who
knows
but
that
all
the
freedom
that
we
have
had
with
one
another
might
come
to
be
spread
abroad
and
then
i
am
ruined
for
ever
and
the
young
man
seeing
that
his
mistris
is
so
constant
to
him
not
hearkning
to
the
advice
of
her
friends
is
so
struck
to
the
heart
with
such
fiery
flames
of
love
that
he
resolved
never
to
leave
her
tho
he
might
feed
upon
bread
and
water
or
go
a
begging
with
her
so
that
he
saies
bargain
by
the
contract
of
matrimony
for
what
you
will
nay
tho
you
would
write
hell
and
damnation
i
am
contented
and
resolve
to
sign
it
but
thinking
by
himself
with
a
will
all
this
may
be
broken
and
new
made
again
hardly
beleeving
that
this
fair
weather
should
be
darkned
with
black
clouds
or
that
this
splendent
serenissimo
would
be
obstructed
by
eclipses
but
finally
there
comes
an
appearance
of
the
desired
pleasure
for
the
knot
is
tied
and
the
publick
notary
doth
at
large
and
very
circumstantially
write
the
contract
of
matrimony
which
is
signed
by
both
parties
oh
heavens
this
is
a
burthen
from
my
heart
and
a
milstone
removed
out
of
the
way
here
now
right
matter
for
more
then
ordinary
mirth
all
the
friends
wish
the
young
couple
much
joy
about
goes
a
health
the
good
success
of
the
marriage
and
every
one
wishing
them
tubs
full
of
blessings
and
houses
full
of
prosperity
one
that
wish
did
half
but
give
how
richly
this
young
couple
then
might
yet
it
helps
as
much
as
it
will
if
they
get
nothing
they
lose
nothing
by
it
and
thinking
by
themselves
in
time
see
what
it
produces
then
if
there
be
but
one
among
them
who
is
talkative
and
that
by
drinking
merrily
the
good
success
of
the
approaching
marriage
his
tongue
begins
to
run
he
relates
what
hapned
to
him
at
the
closing
of
his
marriage
keeping
of
his
wedding
and
in
his
married
estate
and
commonly
the
conclusion
of
his
discourse
is
that
he
thought
at
first
he
had
the
world
at
will
but
then
there
came
this
and
then
that
and
a
thousand
other
vexatious
things
which
continually
or
for
the
most
part
of
the
time
with
great
grief
and
trouble
had
kept
him
so
much
backward
that
it
was
long
before
he
could
get
forward
in
the
world
well
r
bridegroom
you
may
freely
tickle
your
fancy
to
the
top
and
rejoice
superabundantly
that
the
match
is
concluded
you
have
now
gotten
your
legs
into
the
stocks
and
your
arms
into
such
desired
for
fetters
that
nothing
but
death
it
self
can
unloosen
them
and
you
rs
bride
who
look
so
prettily
with
such
a
smirking
countenance
be
you
merry
you
are
the
bride
yea
the
bride
that
occasions
all
this
tripping
and
dansing
now
you
shall
have
a
husband
too
a
protector
who
will
hug
and
imbrace
you
and
somtimes
tumble
and
rumble
you
and
oftimes
approach
to
you
with
a
morning
salutation
that
will
comfort
the
very
cockles
of
your
heart
he
will
if
all
falls
out
well
be
your
comforter
your
your
your
nay
all
what
your
heart
wish
for
or
the
heavens
grant
unto
you
be
your
doctor
to
cure
your
your
pains
in
the
reins
of
your
back
and
at
your
heart
and
all
other
distempers
whatsoever
he
will
also
wipe
of
all
your
tears
with
kisses
and
you
shall
not
dream
of
that
thing
in
the
night
but
let
it
be
made
for
you
by
day
and
may
not
then
your
ask
why
should
not
you
be
merry
but
alas
you
harmless
dove
that
think
you
are
going
into
paradice
pray
tell
me
when
you
were
going
to
sign
the
contract
of
marriage
what
was
the
reason
that
you
alter
so
mightily
that
your
hand
shook
so
verily
though
i
am
no
astronomer
or
caster
of
figures
yet
nevertheless
it
was
none
of
the
best
signs
and
that
one
might
already
begin
to
make
a
strange
prognostication
from
it
the
events
whereof
would
be
more
certain
then
any
thing
that
or
any
other
almanack
maker
ever
writ
but
let
that
alone
for
in
a
short
time
it
will
discover
it
self
therefore
mistress
bride
make
you
merry
and
since
you
have
gotten
your
desire
to
be
the
bride
before
any
of
your
bridemaids
it
would
be
unreasonable
that
you
should
be
troubled
now
with
any
other
business
and
indeed
here
work
enough
for
the
ordering
of
things
that
you
must
trouble
your
head
with
for
the
brides
apparel
must
be
made
and
the
stufs
laces
lining
cuffs
and
many
other
things
are
yet
to
be
bought
well
who
can
see
an
end
of
all
your
business
there
one
piece
of
stuf
is
too
light
and
another
too
dark
the
third
looks
dull
and
hath
no
gloss
and
see
here
three
or
four
daies
gon
and
little
or
nothing
bought
yet
and
the
worst
of
all
is
that
you
are
thus
busie
in
contriving
ordering
and
looking
upon
things
you
are
every
moment
hindered
taken
off
from
it
with
a
continual
knocking
at
the
dore
to
sollicite
one
to
deliver
all
sorts
of
comfits
another
to
deliver
the
ornaments
for
the
brides
garland
flowers
c
a
third
to
be
cook
pastryman
so
many
more
which
come
one
after
another
thundering
so
at
the
door
that
it
is
one
bodies
work
to
let
them
in
and
carry
their
message
to
the
bride
oh
call
the
bride
time
will
deceive
us
the
semstress
and
starcher
must
be
sent
for
and
the
linnen
must
be
bought
ordered
for
the
bridegrooms
shirts
the
brides
smocks
cuffs
bands
and
handkerchifs
do
but
see
the
day
is
at
an
end
again
my
brains
are
almost
addle
and
nothing
goes
forward
for
rs
smug
said
she
would
bring
linnen
and
rs
smooth
laces
but
neither
of
them
both
are
yet
come
run
now
men
and
maids
as
if
the
devil
were
in
you
and
comfort
your
selves
that
the
bride
will
reward
you
liberally
for
your
pains
well
rs
bride
how
your
head
so
out
of
order
might
not
you
now
do
as
once
a
schoolmaster
did
hang
out
the
sign
of
a
troubled
pate
with
a
crown
upon
it
how
glad
be
when
this
confusion
is
once
over
could
you
ever
have
thought
that
there
was
so
much
work
to
be
found
in
it
but
comfort
your
self
therewith
that
for
these
few
troublesom
daies
have
many
pleasant
nights
and
it
is
not
your
case
alone
to
be
in
all
this
trouble
for
the
bridegroom
is
running
up
and
down
like
a
dog
in
taking
care
that
the
banns
of
matrimony
may
be
proclaim
and
now
he
a
running
to
and
again
through
the
city
to
see
if
he
can
get
bridemen
to
his
mind
that
are
capacitated
to
entertain
the
bridemaids
and
gentlewomen
with
pretty
discourses
waiting
upon
them
to
make
mirth
pleasure
for
them
and
the
rest
of
the
company
besides
that
he
taking
care
for
the
getting
of
some
good
wines
that
those
friends
which
come
to
wish
the
bride
and
bridegroom
much
joy
may
be
presented
with
a
delicate
glass
of
wine
and
principally
that
those
who
are
busie
about
the
brides
adornments
may
tast
the
brides
tears
but
really
friends
if
you
come
to
tast
the
brides
tears
now
is
a
great
while
too
soon
but
if
have
of
the
right
and
unfeigned
ones
you
must
come
some
months
hence
o
bridegroom
who
can
but
pitty
you
that
you
must
thus
toil
moil
and
run
up
and
down
and
the
jeweller
and
you
have
just
now
mist
one
another
he
is
doubtless
chatting
with
the
bride
and
shewing
of
her
some
costly
jewels
which
perhaps
dislike
her
a
whit
the
worse
and
what
she
has
then
a
mind
to
find
work
enough
to
disswade
her
from
let
them
cost
what
they
will
for
let
you
take
care
for
that
and
it
is
time
enough
to
be
considered
on
when
the
weddings
over
for
now
you
have
as
much
work
as
you
can
turn
your
self
to
in
getting
all
your
things
in
a
readiness
from
the
tailor
semstress
and
haberdasher
and
herewith
alas
find
that
oftentimes
two
or
three
weeks
are
consumed
in
this
sort
of
business
with
the
greatest
slavery
imaginable
yet
r
bridegroom
for
all
these
troubles
you
may
expect
this
reward
to
have
the
pleasure
of
the
best
place
in
the
chancel
with
a
golden
tapistry
laid
before
you
and
for
your
honour
the
organs
playing
the
going
with
a
coach
to
marry
at
a
country
town
has
not
half
so
much
grace
and
will
not
at
all
please
the
bride
it
is
therefore
requisite
to
consult
with
the
friends
on
both
sides
who
shall
be
invited
to
the
wedding
and
who
not
for
it
seldom
happens
but
there
is
one
broil
or
another
about
it
and
that
no
sooner
don
but
there
arises
a
new
quarrel
to
consider
how
richly
or
frugally
the
guests
shall
be
treated
for
they
would
come
off
with
credit
and
little
charge
to
this
is
required
the
advice
of
a
steward
because
it
is
their
daily
work
and
he
for
favour
of
the
cook
pasterer
and
poulterer
reaping
oftentimes
his
own
benefit
by
it
orders
all
things
so
liberally
as
he
can
make
the
people
beleeve
that
is
requisite
and
the
bride
thinks
the
nobler
it
is
the
better
i
like
it
for
i
am
but
once
the
bride
but
this
matter
being
dispatcht
there
another
consideration
to
be
taken
in
hand
to
know
how
the
bride
bridegrooms
friends
shall
be
plac
at
the
table
the
ordering
whereof
many
times
causes
such
great
disputes
that
if
they
had
known
it
before
they
would
rather
have
kept
no
wedding
in
somuch
that
the
bridegroom
and
the
bride
with
sighing
say
to
one
another
alas
what
a
thick
shell
this
marriage
nut
hath
before
one
can
come
to
the
kernel
of
it
but
bridegroom
to
drive
these
damps
out
of
your
brain
there
no
better
remedy
then
to
go
along
with
your
bridemen
to
tast
the
wedding
wine
for
there
must
be
sure
care
taken
that
it
may
be
of
a
delicate
tast
and
relish
because
that
which
was
laid
in
before
was
not
so
delicious
as
is
required
for
such
a
noble
wedding
where
there
will
be
so
many
curious
tasters
ha
riva
look
bride
and
bridemaids
you
may
now
expect
a
jolly
bridegroom
and
bridemen
for
the
is
such
a
noble
blade
that
none
of
them
all
shall
escape
him
before
they
have
drunk
as
many
glasses
as
there
are
hoops
upon
the
that
they
tasted
of
adieu
all
care
the
wedding
is
at
hand
who
thinks
now
of
any
thing
but
superfluity
of
mirth
away
with
all
these
whining
pining
carpers
who
are
constantly
talking
prating
that
the
married
estate
brings
nothing
but
care
and
sorrow
with
it
here
to
the
contrary
they
may
see
how
all
minds
intentions
are
knit
together
to
consume
and
pass
away
these
daies
with
the
most
superabounding
pleasures
away
with
sorrow
is
not
invited
to
be
among
the
wedding
guests
noct
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
thought
on
but
to
help
these
lovers
that
they
may
enjoy
the
kernel
of
the
first
pleasure
of
their
marriage
but
really
there
poor
mally
the
maid
is
almost
dead
with
longing
and
thinks
her
very
heart
in
pieces
scarcely
knowing
when
the
first
will
be
ended
that
she
might
carry
up
some
water
to
the
young
couple
and
have
a
feeling
of
those
liberal
gifts
that
she
shall
receive
from
the
bridegroom
and
the
bride
for
all
her
attendance
running
and
turmoiling
and
her
thoughts
are
that
no
body
has
deserved
it
better
for
by
night
and
by
day
she
waited
upon
them
and
was
very
diligent
and
faithfull
in
conveyance
of
their
but
all
upon
fair
promises
having
carried
her
self
in
the
time
of
their
wooing
almost
like
a
bawd
to
the
bride
for
which
she
never
had
in
all
the
time
but
three
gratuities
from
the
bridegroom
now
the
bride
is
in
the
bed
the
former
promises
are
make
your
self
merry
amongst
the
rest
of
the
wedding
guests
so
far
as
is
becoming
you
who
knows
but
that
some
brave
gentlemans
man
coachman
or
neighbors
servant
may
fall
in
love
with
you
for
many
times
out
of
one
wedding
comes
another
and
then
you
might
come
to
be
a
woman
of
good
fashion
udsbud
mally
then
you
would
know
as
well
as
your
mistress
what
delights
are
to
be
had
in
the
first
wedding
night
then
you
would
also
know
how
to
discourse
of
the
first
pleasure
of
marriage
and
with
the
bride
expect
the
second
the
second
pleasure
woman
goes
to
buy
the
unthankfulness
of
some
of
the
and
thankfulness
of
well

glad

needs
be

she
must
either
have
the

the

are
needfull
in
you
can
not
be
without
them
and
that
mony
must
alwaies
be
certainly
ready
get
it
where
you
will
then
saies
the
wife
all
this
at
least
there
must
needs
be
if
we
will
have
any
people
of
fashion
come
into
our
house
you
know
your
beloved
hath
also
some
egs
to
fry
and
did
bring
you
a
good
portion
though
it
consist
in
immovable
goods
as
in
houses
orchards
and
lands
that
be
oftentimes
in
another
shire
thither
you
may
go
then
with
your
hony
twice
a
year
for
the
refreshing
of
your
spirits
and
taking
your
pleasure
to
receive
the
fruits
of
the
orchards
and
revenues
of
the
lands
here
every
one
salutes
you
with
the
name
of
landlord
and
according
to
their
country
fashion
indeavour
to
receive
you
with
all
civilities
and
kind
entertainment
if
with
their
you
have
a
mind
to
go
and
look
upon
the
land
and
to
be
a
participator
of
those
sort
of
pleasures
or
to
eat
some
new
curds
cream
gammon
of
bacon
and
ripe
fruits
all
these
things
in
place
of
mony
shall
be
willingly
and
neatly
disht
up
to
you
for
here
meet
with
complaints
that
by
the
war
the
houses
are
burnt
the
orchards
destroied
and
the
growth
of
the
fields
spoiled
therefore
it
is
not
fit
that
you
should
trouble
the
poor
people
but
think
this
is
the
use
custom
and
fruits
of
war
if
the
impositions
and
taxes
run
high
the
country
farmer
ca
help
that
you
know
that
the
war
costs
mony
and
it
must
be
given
or
else
we
should
lose
all
at
such
a
time
as
this
your
only
mirth
must
be
that
through
this
gallant
marriage
you
are
now
lord
of
so
many
acres
of
land
so
many
orchards
and
of
so
many
dainty
houses
and
land
if
your
mony
bags
do
much
increase
by
it
at
present
but
rather
lessen
that
most
no
waies
cloud
your
mirth
would
you
trouble
your
self
at
such
trivial
things
you
have
work
enough
daily
we
can
not
have
all
things
so
to
our
minds
in
this
world
for
if
you
had
your
wives
portion
down
in
ready
mony
you
have
been
at
a
stand
again
where
without
danger
you
should
have
put
it
out
at
interest
fearing
that
they
might
play
bankrupt
with
it
houses
and
lands
are
alwaies
fast
and
they
will
pay
well
when
the
war
is
done
therefore
you
must
drive
these
vapors
out
of
your
head
and
make
your
self
merry
with
the
hearing
that
your
friends
commend
the
entertainment
they
have
had
to
the
highest
and
that
two
or
three
daies
hence
the
merry
bridemen
and
bridemaids
with
some
of
the
nearest
acquaintance
will
come
la
to
give
you
thanks
for
all
the
respect
civilities
that
you
have
so
liberally
bestowed
upon
them
which
will
be
done
then
with
such
a
friendly
and
affectionate
heart
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
but
you
must
invite
them
again
to
come
and
sup
with
you
in
the
evening
and
so
make
an
addition
to
the
former
pleasure
by
which
means
pleasantness
mirth
and
friendship
is
planted
and
advanced
among
all
the
friends
and
acquaintance
is
true
be
sure
to
hear
that
there
were
some
at
the
wedding
who
were
displeased
for
not
being
entertained
according
to
their
expectations
and
because
their
uncle
a
new
married
niece
and
some
other
friends
were
not
seated
in
their
right
places
that
rs
had
a
to
wait
upon
her
and
r
an
old
r
was
forced
to
wait
upon
a
young
and
that
squire
could
not
sit
easily
and
rs
gorget
was
rumbled
and
that
and
and
were
almost
throng
in
pieces
and
could
hardly
get
any
of
the
sweetmeats
but
you
must
not
at
all
be
troubled
with
this
for
is
a
hard
matter
to
please
every
body
is
enough
that
you
have
been
at
such
a
vast
charge
and
presented
them
with
your
feast
truly
they
ought
to
have
been
contented
thankfull
to
the
highest
degree
and
what
they
are
unsatisfied
with
needed
not
to
have
cost
you
so
much
mony
for
if
you
had
left
them
all
at
home
you
could
have
had
no
worse
reward
but
a
great
deal
less
charge
comfort
your
self
with
this
that
when
it
happens
again
you
will
not
buy
ingratitude
at
so
high
a
rate
is
much
better
to
invite
them
at
two
or
three
several
times
before
hand
and
entertain
them
with
a
merry
glass
of
wine
up
and
away
and
then
invite
a
small
company
which
are
better
to
govern
and
satisfied
is
a
great
deal
more
pleasure
for
you
to
see
your
wives
friends
animate
one
another
to
come
a
fortnight
after
the
wedding
and
surprize
you
with
shewing
their
thankfulness
and
satisfaction
for
the
respect
they
have
received
from
you
and
that
they
are
alwaies
desirous
to
cultivate
the
friendship
by
now
and
then
coming
to
give
you
a
visit
this
is
here
again
a
new
joy
and
as
long
as
you
keep
open
table
and
cellar
for
them
that
reception
will
keep
all
discontent
from
growing
among
them
yes
and
it
will
please
your
wife
too
extraordinary
well
and
by
thus
doing
you
will
not
be
subject
to
as
many
other
men
are
your
wives
maundring
that
you
entertained
her
friends
so
hungrily
and
unhandsomly
but
for
this
you
shall
be
both
by
her
and
her
friends
beloved
and
commended
in
the
highest
degree
yea
it
will
be
an
incouragement
that
they
in
the
same
manner
will
entertain
your
friends
like
an
angel
and
be
alwaies
seeking
to
keep
a
fair
correspondence
among
them
so
that
in
the
summer
time
for
an
afternoons
collation
see
a
of
grapes
nuts
and
peaches
prepared
for
you
which
cold
fruits
must
then
be
warm
with
a
good
glass
of
wine
and
in
the
winter
to
please
your
appetite
a
dish
of
pancakes
fritters
or
a
barrel
of
oisters
but
none
of
these
neither
will
be
agreeable
without
a
delicate
glass
of
wine
oh
quintessence
of
all
mirth
who
could
not
but
wish
to
get
such
aunts
such
cousins
such
bridemen
and
bridemaids
in
their
marriage
therefore
if
you
meet
with
one
or
of
your
cousins
press
him
to
go
home
with
you
to
refresh
himself
with
a
glass
of
wine
o
it
will
be
extreamly
pleasing
to
your
wife
and
a
double
respect
paid
to
him
because
you
bring
him
to
a
collation
among
other
cousins
and
pretty
gentlewomen
where
the
knot
of
friendship
and
familiarity
is
renewed
and
faster
twisted
and
who
knows
if
you
bring
in
a
batchelor
but
there
may
perhaps
arise
a
new
marriage
which
would
be
extraordinarily
pleasing
to
your
wife
for
there
is
nothing
more
agreeable
to
the
female
sex
then
that
they
may
be
instrumental
in
helping
their
bridemaids
to
husbands
and
thus
you
will
see
a
double
increase
of
your
minions
and
your
wife
get
more
friends
to
accompany
her
and
drive
fancies
out
of
her
head
if
your
wife
should
fail
in
her
choice
of
and
other
sort
of
those
appurtenances
doubt
not
but
these
will
be
prudent
for
her
if
she
be
unexperienc
to
counsel
and
advise
her
to
buy
of
the
richest
and
newest
mode
and
what
will
be
neatest
and
where
to
be
bought
oh
these
are
so
skilfull
in
the
art
of
ordring
things
that
you
need
not
dispute
with
your
wife
about
the
hanging
of
a
picture
above
the
for
presently
say
there
nothing
better
in
that
place
then
large
china
dishes
and
that
must
be
taken
down
and
another
set
up
in
the
place
with
curious
curtains
and
vallians
and
daslles
and
thus
they
will
deliver
themselves
like
a
court
full
of
wise
counsellors
for
the
pleasure
and
instruction
of
your
beloved
well
what
could
you
wish
for
more
d
talk
of
mony
pish
that
stamp
with
hammers
give
it
liberally
the
good
woman
knows
how
and
where
to
lay
it
out
if
there
be
but
little
mony
by
the
hand
be
silent
of
that
it
might
happen
to
disturb
your
dear
and
who
knows
wherein
it
may
do
her
harm
it
is
not
the
fashion
that
women
especially
young
married
ones
should
take
care
for
that
is
care
enough
for
her
if
she
contrive
and
consider
what
must
be
bought
and
what
things
will
be
most
suitable
together
for
this
care
is
so
great
that
she
never
wakens
in
the
night
but
she
thinks
o
yea
it
costs
her
many
an
hours
rest
therefore
ought
not
to
be
so
lightly
esteemed
and
now
o
young
husband
since
you
are
come
to
the
first
step
of
the
school
to
exercise
your
patience
it
is
not
fit
that
you
should
already
begin
to
grumble
and
talk
how
needfull
it
is
to
be
sparing
and
thrifty
that
merchandising
and
trading
is
mighty
dead
that
monies
is
not
to
be
got
in
and
that
here
and
there
reckonings
and
bills
must
be
paid
o
no
you
must
be
silent
tho
you
should
burst
with
discontent
for
herewith
perhaps
the
whole
house
would
be
out
of
order
and
you
might
get
for
an
answer
how
have
i
married
then
a
pittifull
poor
bridegroom
this
would
be
sad
to
hear
go
therefore
to
school
by
to
learn
silence
and
to
look
upon
all
things
in
the
beginning
with
patience
to
let
your
wife
do
her
own
pleasure
and
to
mix
hony
with
your
words
then
you
shall
possess
the
quintessence
of
this
pleasure
fully
and
with
joyfull
steps
enter
upon
the
folowing
the
third
pleasure
young
couple
walk
daily
abroad
being
entertained
and
treated
by
all
their
friends
and
acquaintance
and
then
travell
into
the
country
for
their
if
it
be
true
that
there
is
a
mountain
of
mirth
and
pleasure
for
young
married
people
to
ascend
unto
these
are
certainly
the
finest
and
smoothest
conductors
to
it
that
because
it
was
impossible
to
invite
every
one
to
the
wedding
this
sweet
must
be
led
abroad
and
shewed
to
all
her
husbands
friends
acquaintance
yea
all
the
world
must
see
what
a
pretty
couple
they
are
and
how
handsomly
they
agree
together
to
which
end
they
trick
and
prick
themselves
daily
up
in
their
best
apparel
garnishing
both
the
whole
city
and
streets
with
tatling
and
pratling
staring
into
the
houses
of
all
their
acquaintance
to
see
whether
they
are
looked
at
illustration
folio
by
the
navarre
society
do
but
see
what
a
mighty
and
surpassing
mirth
for
they
hardly
can
go
ten
or
twelve
furlongs
but
they
constantly
meet
and
are
saluted
by
some
of
their
acquaintance
wishing
them
all
health
happiness
and
prosperity
or
by
others
invited
to
come
in
and
are
treated
according
as
occasion
presents
wishing
them
also
much
joy
in
their
married
estate
yea
the
great
bowl
is
rins
and
about
goes
a
brimmer
to
the
good
prosperity
of
the
young
couple
well
thinks
the
young
woman
what
a
vast
difference
there
is
between
being
a
married
woman
a
maid
how
every
one
receives
treats
you
what
respect
and
honour
every
one
shews
you
how
you
go
daily
in
all
your
gallantry
taking
pleasure
and
how
every
where
you
are
fawn
upon
imbrac
and
kist
receiving
all
manner
of
friendship
it
is
no
wonder
that
all
womankind
are
so
desirous
of
marriage
and
no
sooner
lose
their
first
husbands
but
they
think
immediately
how
to
get
a
second
oh
saith
she
what
a
fulness
of
joy
there
is
in
the
married
estate
by
virginity
i
resolve
therefore
to
think
also
upon
my
bridemaids
and
to
recommend
them
where
ever
there
is
occasion
and
this
is
the
least
yet
do
but
see
what
for
greater
pleasure
for
every
foot
you
are
invited
out
here
there
to
a
new
treat
that
is
as
noble
and
as
gallant
as
the
wedding
was
and
are
alwaies
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
if
next
day
you
be
but
a
little
drousie
or
that
the
head
akes
the
husband
knows
a
present
remedy
to
settle
the
brain
and
the
first
thing
he
saith
is
come
lets
go
to
see
master
or
mistriss
such
a
one
and
walk
out
of
town
to
refresh
our
selves
or
else
go
and
take
the
air
upon
the
with
a
pair
of
oars
here
is
such
a
fresh
mirth
again
that
all
the
and
shakes
with
it
oh
that
would
but
drive
his
horses
slowly
that
the
day
might
be
three
hours
longer
for
it
is
too
soon
to
depart
and
that
for
fear
of
a
pocky
setting
of
the
watch
so
that
its
every
day
well
who
is
so
blind
that
he
can
not
see
the
abundant
pleasures
of
marriage
to
this
again
no
sooner
has
the
young
couple
been
some
few
daies
at
rest
and
begin
to
see
that
the
invitements
decline
but
the
young
woman
talks
of
going
out
of
town
together
and
to
take
their
pleasures
in
other
towns
and
cities
first
in
the
next
adjacent
places
and
then
to
others
that
ly
remoter
for
because
she
never
was
there
and
having
heard
them
commended
to
be
such
curious
and
neat
places
she
hath
a
great
mind
to
see
and
yea
and
then
she
saith
my
dear
we
must
go
also
to
see
and
and
take
our
pleasures
those
waies
for
i
have
heard
my
fathers
book
keeper
often
say
that
it
is
very
pleasant
travelling
thither
and
all
things
very
cheap
and
when
he
began
to
relate
any
thing
of
kent
and
its
multiplicity
of
fruit
my
very
heart
leapt
up
for
joy
thinking
to
my
self
as
soon
as
i
am
married
i
will
immediately
be
pressing
my
husband
that
we
may
go
thither
because
it
seem
to
me
almost
incredible
and
then
again
he
would
sometimes
relate
of
what
delicious
syder
and
perry
is
made
there
which
i
am
a
great
lover
of
truly
hony
we
must
needs
go
that
way
once
that
i
may
say
i
have
satiated
my
self
with
it
at
the
ah
my
dearest
let
us
go
thither
next
week
it
is
most
certain
that
the
hath
no
mind
at
all
to
be
thus
much
longer
out
of
his
house
from
his
vocation
by
reason
he
is
already
so
much
behind
hand
with
his
loss
of
time
in
wooing
wedding
feasting
and
taking
pleasure
but
alas
let
him
say
what
he
will
he
can
not
disswade
her
from
it
may
as
soon
retort
the
wind
as
make
a
woman
change
her
in
the
night
she
dreams
o
and
by
day
she
talks
o
and
alwaies
concludes
this
to
be
her
certain
rule
the
first
year
wo
come
again
if
we
do
take
some
pleasure
now
when
shall
we
do
it
oh
my
dear
a
year
hence
we
may
have
a
child
then
its
impossible
for
me
to
go
any
where
but
i
shall
be
tied
like
a
dog
to
a
chain
and
truly
why
should
not
we
do
it
as
well
as
they
they
did
for
they
were
out
a
month
or
two
and
took
their
pleasures
to
the
purpose
my
mother
or
my
cousin
will
look
to
our
house
come
let
us
go
also
out
of
town
for
the
first
year
will
not
come
again
well
what
shall
the
good
man
do
if
he
will
have
quietness
with
his
wife
he
must
let
her
have
her
will
or
else
she
will
be
daily
tormenting
of
him
and
to
give
her
harsh
language
he
ca
do
that
for
he
loves
her
too
well
his
father
also
taught
him
this
saying
for
a
marriage
lesson
a
care
of
making
the
first
if
he
speak
unkindly
to
her
his
love
might
be
angry
and
then
that
would
occasion
the
first
difference
which
he
by
no
means
willingly
would
be
guilty
of
for
then
these
pleasures
would
not
have
their
full
swing
well
away
they
go
now
out
of
town
but
uds
lid
what
a
weighty
trunk
they
send
the
porter
with
to
the
carriers
for
they
take
all
their
best
apparel
with
them
that
their
friends
in
the
country
may
see
all
their
bravery
and
besides
all
this
there
must
be
a
riding
gown
and
some
other
new
accoutrements
made
for
the
journy
or
else
it
would
have
no
grace
now
then
away
they
go
every
one
wishing
them
all
health
and
prosperity
upon
their
journy
so
do
i
but
see
they
are
hardly
ridden
ten
mile
out
of
town
before
the
young
woman
begins
to
be
so
ill
with
the
horses
jolting
that
she
thinks
the
world
turns
with
her
oh
she
so
ill
that
she
fears
she
shall
vomit
her
very
heart
up
then
down
lights
her
husband
to
take
her
off
and
hold
her
head
and
is
in
such
a
peck
of
troubles
that
he
knows
not
which
way
to
turn
or
wind
himself
wishing
that
he
might
give
all
that
he
worth
in
the
world
to
be
at
a
good
inn
and
she
poor
creature
falling
into
a
swoon
makes
him
look
as
if
he
had
bepist
himself
though
he
sighs
and
laments
excessively
she
hears
him
not
which
occasions
him
such
an
extremity
of
grief
that
he
ready
to
tear
the
hair
off
of
his
head
but
the
quamishness
of
her
stomack
beginning
to
decline
she
recovers
and
rising
they
walk
for
a
little
space
softly
forwards
the
good
man
thinking
with
himself
how
he
shall
do
to
get
his
dearly
beloved
to
an
inn
that
she
may
there
rest
her
distempered
body
and
then
getting
her
up
again
they
ride
very
softly
forwards
to
get
to
the
end
of
their
journy
truly
i
must
confess
that
amongst
the
rest
of
the
pleasures
of
marriage
this
is
but
a
very
sorry
one
but
stay
a
little
yonder
me
thinks
i
see
the
steeple
we
shall
be
there
presently
the
little
trouble
and
grief
you
have
had
will
make
the
salutations
you
receive
and
the
scituation
of
the
place
seem
so
much
the
pleasanter
and
these
dainty
green
meadows
will
be
a
delicate
refreshment
find
your
stomack
not
only
sharpned
but
also
curiously
cleansed
of
all
sorts
of
filthy
and
slimy
humours
and
you
light
not
sooner
from
your
horse
then
your
appetite
is
ready
to
entertain
what
ever
comes
before
you
the
good
man
in
the
mean
while
is
contriving
at
whose
house
he
shall
first
whet
his
knife
and
where
he
thinks
his
poor
wearied
wife
will
receive
the
best
entertainment
and
caresses
to
drive
out
of
her
imaginations
the
troubles
and
wearisomness
of
her
journy
which
will
the
easier
be
dispensed
with
when
she
walks
out
to
see
the
rarities
of
the
place
and
to
visit
your
cousins
and
relations
and
so
much
the
more
because
every
one
will
be
wishing
the
new
married
couple
much
joy
receiving
them
kindly
and
doing
them
all
manner
of
pleasures
and
civilities
which
i
assure
you
is
no
small
matter
of
mirth
but
every
thing
must
have
an
end
it
is
therefore
now
very
meet
to
speak
of
removing
to
some
other
city
but
let
the
husband
say
what
he
will
of
travelling
by
horseback
she
is
struck
on
that
ear
with
an
incurable
deafness
they
must
have
a
coach
to
themselves
and
the
great
trunk
must
go
along
with
them
or
else
the
whole
journy
would
have
no
grace
neither
would
it
be
respect
enough
for
them
in
the
presence
of
so
many
good
friends
and
acquaintance
unless
the
coach
come
to
take
them
up
at
the
dore
and
it
must
be
done
to
here
now
one
is
returning
thanks
for
and
the
other
for
their
kind
visit
and
withall
wish
the
young
couple
that
all
content
pleasure
and
delight
may
further
attend
them
upon
their
journy
then
it
is
drive
on
coachman
and
away
fly
the
poor
jades
through
the
streets
striking
fire
out
of
the
liveless
stones
as
if
pluto
just
at
the
same
time
were
upon
the
flight
with
his
proserpina
through
the
city
but
o
new
married
couple
what
price
do
you
little
think
this
mirth
will
stand
you
at
what
man
is
there
in
the
world
that
hath
ever
an
eye
in
his
head
but
must
needs
see
that
if
he
tarry
out
long
this
must
be
the
ready
way
to
yet
nevertheless
i
confess
you
must
do
it
if
you
intend
to
have
any
peace
or
quietness
with
your
new
wife
these
are
the
first
fruits
and
pleasures
of
marriage
therefore
you
must
not
so
much
as
consider
nay
hardly
think
of
being
so
long
from
home
though
in
the
mean
while
all
things
there
is
going
also
the
ready
way
to
destruction
for
it
is
the
fashion
at
such
times
that
maid
man
and
all
that
are
in
your
service
to
act
their
own
parts
and
so
merry
they
are
that
they
possess
their
own
freedom
and
keep
open
table
that
the
whole
neighbourhood
hears
their
laughter
ask
the
neighbours
when
you
come
home
and
you
will
quickly
hear
that
by
them
was
no
thought
of
care
or
sorrow
but
that
they
have
plaied
ranted
and
domineer
so
that
the
whole
neighbourhood
rung
with
it
and
how
they
have
played
their
parts
either
with
some
dried
baker
pricklouse
tailor
or
smoaky
smith
they
themselves
know
best
down
goes
the
spit
to
the
fire
the
pudding
pan
prepared
and
if
there
be
either
wine
beer
or
any
thing
else
wanting
though
the
cellar
be
lockt
yet
by
one
means
or
another
they
find
out
such
pretty
devices
to
juggle
the
wine
out
of
the
cask
nay
and
sugar
to
boot
too
that
their
inventions
surpass
all
the
stratagems
that
are
quoted
by
the
author
of
the
english
rogue
of
which
i
could
insert
a
vast
number
but
fear
that
it
would
occasion
an
ill
example
to
the
unlearned
in
that
study
howsoever
they
that
have
kept
house
long
and
had
both
men
have
undoubtedly
found
both
the
truth
and
experience
hereof
sufficiently
and
how
many
maids
in
this
manner
have
been
eased
of
that
heavy
burthen
of
their
maidenheads
is
well
known
to
the
whole
world
these
are
also
some
of
the
first
fruits
and
delights
of
marriage
but
if
they
were
of
the
greatest
sort
they
might
be
esteemed
and
approved
of
to
be
curable
or
a
remedy
found
for
prevention
yet
let
them
be
of
what
state
and
condition
they
will
every
one
feels
the
damage
and
inconvenience
thereof
ten
times
more
then
it
is
outwardly
visible
unto
him
or
can
comprehend
for
if
you
saw
it
you
would
by
one
or
other
means
shun
or
prevent
it
but
now
let
it
be
who
it
will
whether
counsellor
doctor
merchant
or
shopkeeper
the
one
neglects
his
clients
suit
the
other
his
patients
the
third
his
negotiation
trade
and
the
fourth
his
customers
none
of
them
all
knowing
from
whence
it
arises
that
their
first
years
gain
is
so
inconsiderable
for
above
the
continual
running
on
of
the
neglect
and
unnecessary
expensive
charge
of
servants
you
consume
your
self
also
much
mony
in
travelling
and
pleasure
besides
the
peril
and
uneasiness
that
you
suffer
to
please
and
complaite
your
new
married
mistris
o
miserable
pleasure
but
you
will
be
sure
to
find
the
greatest
calamity
of
this
delight
as
soon
as
you
return
home
again
if
you
only
observe
the
motions
of
your
wife
for
whose
pleasure
and
felicity
you
have
been
so
long
from
home
alas
she
is
so
wearied
and
tired
with
tumbling
and
travelling
up
down
that
she
complains
as
if
her
back
were
broke
and
it
is
impossible
for
her
to
rise
before
it
is
about
dinner
time
nay
and
then
neither
hardly
unless
she
hear
that
there
is
something
prepared
suitable
to
her
appetite
if
any
thing
either
at
noon
or
night
is
to
be
prepared
and
made
ready
the
husband
must
take
care
and
give
order
for
the
doing
of
it
the
good
woman
being
yet
so
weary
that
she
can
not
settle
her
self
to
it
yea
it
is
too
much
for
her
to
walk
about
her
chamber
her
very
joints
being
as
it
were
dislocated
with
the
troublesomness
of
the
journy
in
the
mean
while
the
servants
they
ly
simpring
giggling
and
laughing
at
one
another
doing
just
what
they
list
and
wishing
that
their
mistris
might
be
alwaies
in
that
temper
then
they
were
sure
to
have
the
more
freedom
to
themselves
the
which
though
done
by
stealth
they
make
as
bad
as
may
be
and
yet
hardly
any
man
tho
he
had
the
eyes
of
can
attrap
them
for
if
by
chance
you
should
perceive
any
thing
they
will
find
one
excuse
or
another
to
delude
you
and
look
as
demure
as
a
dog
in
a
halter
whereby
the
good
man
is
easily
pacified
and
satisfied
for
that
time
and
these
things
are
more
predominant
when
there
is
a
cunning
slut
of
a
maid
that
knows
but
how
to
serve
and
flatter
her
mistris
well
getting
her
by
that
means
upon
her
side
in
such
cases
generally
see
two
maids
where
one
might
serve
or
else
a
the
one
to
do
all
the
course
work
the
other
to
run
of
errands
and
lend
a
helping
hand
if
she
hath
a
mind
to
it
that
all
things
may
the
sooner
be
set
in
order
she
then
with
her
mistris
may
go
a
gadding
and
because
peggy
her
mistris
do
in
this
manner
as
it
were
like
a
jack
in
a
box
jump
into
each
others
humour
the
good
woman
may
take
her
rest
the
better
for
she
hath
caretakers
enough
about
the
house
and
if
the
husband
coming
from
the
change
or
other
important
affair
seems
to
be
any
waies
discontented
that
all
things
lies
stragling
about
the
house
are
not
set
in
order
presently
crafty
peggy
finds
a
fit
expedient
for
it
with
complaining
that
her
mistris
hath
had
such
an
insufferable
pain
in
her
head
and
in
her
belly
that
it
was
beyond
imagination
also

what

there
are

you

must
be

the

wife
goes
a
pratling
by
her
neighbours
complaining
of
her
barrenness
and
takes
physick
for
verily
it
is
a
great
pleasure
for
the
new
married
couple
that
they
have
been
up
and
down
taking
their
pleasure
and
have
been
feasted
by
all
their
acquaintance
now
they
have
travelled
from
place
to
place
and
taken
a
full
view
of
what
friends
and
relations
each
other
hath
and
seen
also
the
great
difference
there
is
in
the
ornaments

and
deportments
of
each
place
and
also
how
pleasant

with

but
most
particularly
how
neatly

compleatly

may
for
their

be
treated
yet
come
finally
to
a
consideration
within
themselves
of
the
weakness
and

of
this

perceiving
that
all

who
possess

it
burthensom
and
have
a

to
be
at
home
again
in

verily
this
is
that
happy
hour
of
pleasure
that
the
new
married
man
hath
been
long
seeking
for
to
the
end
he
might
once
be
freed
from
all
such
idle
expences
and
be
again
carefully
looking
after
his

he
begins
to
hope
that
all
things
will
come
into
a

also

but
that
his

will
having
had
her
full
swing
and
hearts
content
of
treats
and
all
other
sorts
of
pleasures
begin
like
a
to
order
her
self
to
take
some
care
for
the
concerns
of
the

which
indeed
falls
out
so
to
the
great

can
it
be

that
this

should
be

bitter

will

may

to
be
at

but
she
begins
to
complain
that
she
can
hardly
addict
her
self
to
this
new
way
of
life
that
it
appears
very
strange
and
odly
to
her
to
converse
with
a
new
maid
by
reason
she
must
be
telling
her
this
thing
and
commanding
her
the
and
have
a
regard
of
all
what
she
does
which
are
things
that
she
before
never
used
to
trouble
her
self
with
and
that
it
is
such
a
trouble
to
her
to
be
out
of
her
parents
house
in
a
strange
dwelling
place
nay
this
surges
so
high
that
the
good
man
hath
his
hands
full
of
work
to
comfort
her
and
to
talk
these
foolish
fancies
out
of
her
noddle
and
verily
unless
he
can
bridle
her
frivolous
humour
with
some
pleasant
discourses
and
dry
up
her
tears
with
no
small
number
of
kisses
oh
then
be
sadly
put
and
if
this
all
falls
out
well
before
six
weeks
are
at
an
end
appear
another
dark
cloud
again
to
eclipse
this
splendant
sunshine
for
behold
within
a
very
small
time
the
good
woman
begins
to
scrape
acquaintance
and
get
some
familiarity
with
her
neighbours
which
increaseth
from
day
to
day
more
and
more
nay
oftentimes
it
comes
to
that
height
she
better
to
be
found
among
her
neighbours
then
at
home
in
her
own
family
here
she
sees
mistris
wanton
playing
with
her
child
that
is
a
very
pretty
babe
there
she
sees
mistres
making
ready
her
linnens
and
getting
of
her
clouts
together
yonder
mistris
complains
that
she
doth
not
prove
with
child
then
mistres
brags
how
nearly
she
could
reckon
from
the
very
oh
then
she
thinks
i
have
been
married
this
three
months
and
know
nothing
at
all
of
these
things
it
is
with
me
still
as
if
i
were
yet
a
maid
what
certainly
should
be
the
reason
thereof
this
is
the
first
occasion
that
begets
a
great
disturbance
in
the
and
imagination
and
wo
be
to
the
good
man
if
he
doth
not
understand
his
well
then
to
the
end
she
may
hear
the
better
how
things
goes
she
inquires
very
earnestly
amongst
her
acquaintance
what
caresses
they
receive
from
their
husbands
and
most
shamlesly
relates
what
hath
passed
between
her
and
her
husband
twixt
the
curtains
or
under
the
rose
which
she
doth
to
that
purpose
that
she
may
hear
whether
her
husband
understands
his
work
well
and
whether
he
doth
it
well
and
oft
enough
and
also
whether
he
be
fully
fit
for
the
employ
for
the
verification
whereof
the
councel
of
women
bring
so
many
compleat
relations
that
it
is
a
shame
to
think
much
more
to
speak
of
them
whosoever
she
speaks
with
every
one
pities
her
and
gives
her
their
advice
and
the
best
sort
will
at
the
least
say
to
her
i
would
oftentimes
treat
my
husband
with
such
sort
of
spices
as
were
good
for
my
self
oisters
egs
sweet
breads
caveer
and
counsell
him
every
morning
to
go
to
the
and
drink
some
chocolate
above
all
things
advise
him
to
desist
from
tabacco
and
drying
things
or
any
other
things
that
are
too
cooling
for
the
kidneys
and
then
i
would
many
times
my
self
by
dallying
with
him
and
some
other
pretty
wanton
postures
try
to
provoke
him
to
it
whereby
he
should
surely
know
that
it
was
neither
your
coolness
nor
want
of
desire
that
might
be
blamed
in
it
but
rather
alwaies
confess
that
you
had
sufficiently
done
your
indeavour
who
will
doubt
but
that
she
puts
this
advice
in
operation
o
happy
man
who
art
now
every
foot
treated
with
some
new
sorts
of
kickshaws
at
your
table
and
have
free
leave
to
frequent
the
which
other
women
grumble
and
mumble
at
and
besides
all
this
you
find
that
your
dearest
embraceth
you
as
if
you
were
an
angel
and
shews
you
a
thousand
other
friendly
entertainments
that
are
beyond
imagination
to
express
it
is
alwaies
in
the
evening
my
dear
come
to
bed
and
in
the
morning
pray
love
ly
a
little
longer
these
are
most
certainly
very
great
pleasures
but
if
the
woman
marks
that
this
helps
not
and
that
all
things
remain
in
the
old
posture
then
she
begins
to
mump
and
maunder
at
her
husband
vaunting
much
of
her
own
fitness
and
not
a
little
suspecting
her
husbands
oftentimes
calling
him
a
fumbler
a
and
a
good
man
this
makes
him
look
as
if
he
had
beshit
him
self
and
though
he
never
so
much
indeavours
to
vindicate
himself
and
also
to
perswade
her
from
the
reasons
and
examples
given
by
several
learned
doctors
culpepper
the
queens
midwife
and
some
others
of
his
friends
and
acquaintance
that
he
demonstrates
unto
her
it
is
all
but
wind
she
still
complains
i
must
have
a
child
or
else
i
shall
run
distracted
and
this
manner
of
frantickness
hath
so
vehemently
struck
into
her
brains
that
the
very
house
seems
to
burn
over
her
head
insomuch
that
she
no
sooner
risen
from
her
bed
or
from
the
table
but
immediately
she
goeth
a
gadding
amongst
the
neighbours
and
takes
other
peoples
children
in
her
arms
kissing
and
slabbring
of
them
so
unmeasurably
as
if
she
would
almost
devour
them
with
love
nay
she
useth
more
simple
and
childish
actions
with
them
then
ever
own
mothers
have
done
by
which
means
the
children
have
many
times
as
great
an
affection
for
their
neighbour
as
they
have
for
their
own
father
and
mother
this
gadding
out
of
dores
doth
undoubtedly
a
little
trouble
her
husband
but
when
he
begins
to
consider
that
his
wife
by
this
means
knows
how
to
handle
and
make
much
of
children
and
then
again
that
she
thus
beforehand
learns
it
for
nothing
it
must
of
necessity
be
no
less
then
a
great
pleasure
for
him
and
so
much
the
more
whilest
she
is
pratling
with
her
neighbour
and
playing
with
her
child
he
is
freed
from
the
curse
of
hearing
her
sighs
and
complaints
to
have
a
child
for
she
no
sooner
within
the
dores
but
she
talks
of
her
neighbours
child
and
wishes
with
the
loss
of
all
that
shes
worth
in
the
world
that
she
had
such
a
one
too
which
continues
alwaies
so
long
that
finally
she
bursts
out
into
the
like
former
frenzy
against
her
husband
see
there
i
must
have
a
child
also
or
else
i
shall
run
distracted
but
what
remedy
which
way
he
turns
or
winds
himself
he
finds
no
means
or
way
how
to
pacifie
his
wife
and
therefore
thinks
it
best
himself
to
take
of
doctor
and
most
especially
with
that
french
doctor
who
is
so
renowned
for
his
skill
of
making
many
men
and
women
that
before
were
barren
and
unfruitfull
to
conceive
children
insomuch
that
they
do
now
every
year
precisely
bear
a
young
son
or
a
daughter
yea
somtimes
two
at
a
time
it
is
thereby
also
very
necessary
that
the
good
woman
her
self
consult
with
some
experienced
midwives
and
old
doctresses
to
the
end
that
those
distempers
which
are
the
occasion
of
barrenness
might
be
the
better
removed
and
taken
away
to
this
end
there
are
almost
as
many
boxes
and
brought
together
as
would
near
upon
furnish
an
apothecaries
shop
then
to
work
they
go
with
smearing
anointing
chafing
infusing
wherewith
as
they
term
it
the
good
woman
is
to
be
made
fresh
and
fit
but
they
make
the
bed
and
whole
house
so
full
of
stink
and
vapours
that
it
may
be
said
they
rather
stop
the
good
and
wholesom
pores
and
other
parts
of
the
body
then
to
open
those
that
were
stopt
and
caused
distempers
but
in
the
conclusion
we
find
it
to
be
both
fruitless
and
miserable
where
the
good
woman
goes
to
seek
it
by
even
as
her
husband
doth
out
of
the
oister
and
and
if
this
will
not
do
now
where
shall
the
poor
man
hide
his
head
next
what
shall
he
do
more
to
please
and
pacifie
her
he
thinks
upon
all
the
ways
and
means
possible
to
entertain
her
to
content
if
she
will
have
costly
things
he
will
buy
them
for
her
and
dissimulately
saith
that
all
what
she
practiseth
for
her
content
is
his
only
pleasure
and
delight
yea
although
her
pride
and
ambition
many
times
in
several
things
flies
too
high
and
also
doth
not
happen
to
be
very
suitable
with
the
constitution
of
the
cash
he
dares
in
no
wise
contradict
her
for
he
fears
that
she
will
presently
be
at
variance
with
him
again
and
thinks
in
the
interim
whilest
her
mind
hangs
upon
these
things
she
forgets
her
maunding
and
mumbling
for
a
child
still
hoping
that
there
will
come
one
happy
night
that
may
crown
his
earnest
desires
with
fructivity
this
it
is
that
makes
him
that
he
dares
not
anger
her
or
give
her
a
sour
countenance
fearing
that
if
she
might
have
conceived
that
would
be
the
means
of
turning
the
tide
to
be
short
it
is
his
only
and
greatest
delight
to
see
that
his
wife
is
well
satisfied
and
receiveth
her
content
and
pleasure
which
is
very
hard
to
be
practised
so
long
as
she
is
not
with
child
but
o
what
a
joy
there
will
be
if
he
may
be
but
once
so
happy
as
to
hit
that
mark
how
will
the
first
day
of
her
reckoning
to
ly
in
stand
in
his
almanack
as
if
it
were
printed
with
a
red
letter
well
young
people
be
contented
long
look
for
comes
at
last
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
master
the
fifth
pleasure
young
woman
proves
with
child
and
the
old
proverb
tels
us
that
after
the
sour
comes
the
sweet
and
i
find
jolly
couple
that
it
is
so
with
you
also
for
i
hear
finally
that
your
wife
is
big
with
child
well
what
a
pleasure
is
that
certainly
now
you
see
that
all
your
doctoring
and
medicining
hath
been
to
some
purpose
and
now
you
feel
also
that
all
herbs
were
made
for
some
good
effects
how
happy
a
thing
it
is
that
you
have
made
use
of
a
learned
doctor
and
an
experienced
midwife
now
is
the
only
time
to
be
very
carefull
for
fear
the
least
accident
might
turn
the
tide
with
the
young
woman
and
so
she
get
a
mischance
or
some
other
sad
mishap
and
a
mischance
is
worse
for
her
than
a
true
for
that
weakens
nature
abundantly
and
oftentimes
brings
with
it
several
sad
consequences
thus
the
women
talk
illustration
folio
by
the
navarre
society
but
you
o
noble
champion
who
have
behaved
your
self
so
gallantly
continue
now
to
reap
the
further
conquests
of
your
honour
look
not
at
any
small
matters
and
most
especially
if
you
hope
or
desire
to
gain
the
principal
prize
of
your
pleasure
for
be
assured
that
you
must
suffer
much
and
see
through
a
perspective
glass
all
things
at
a
distance
because
you
never
before
saw
your
wife
in
so
gallant
a
state
and
condition
as
she
now
is
in
and
therefore
you
must
cherish
and
preserve
her
much
more
then
formerly
you
have
done
if
you
hear
her
often
grunt
and
groan
mumble
and
chide
either
with
the
men
or
nay
though
it
were
with
your
own
self
you
must
pass
it
by
not
concerning
your
self
at
it
and
imagine
that
you
do
it
for
the
respect
you
bear
your
wife
but
not
by
constraint
for
it
is
common
with
women
to
do
so
but
most
especially
rejoice
in
your
self
if
this
grunting
and
groaning
happen
only
by
day
time
because
then
you
may
somtimes
avoid
it
or
divertise
your
self
with
other
company
yet
by
night
generally
shall
the
good
woman
be
worst
of
all
therefore
be
sure
to
provide
your
self
well
with
pure
aniseed
clove
and
good
sack
that
you
may
therewith
be
ready
to
strengthen
and
assist
her
for
it
will
often
happen
that
when
you
are
in
your
best
and
first
sleep
that
your
dearest
wil
waken
you
and
complain
of
pain
at
her
heart
of
dizziness
and
great
faintness
then
all
what
is
in
the
house
must
be
stirring
and
you
your
self
also
though
it
be
never
so
cold
out
of
the
bed
you
must
with
all
the
speed
possible
comfort
your
self
herewith
that
this
was
one
of
the
pleasures
which
you
got
with
your
wife
though
it
was
not
set
down
in
the
contract
of
marriage
now
for
this
again
you
alwaies
receive
the
honour
that
when
you
are
invited
with
her
to
any
place
at
a
treat
the
best
that
is
upon
the
table
shall
be
presented
to
the
woman
yea
if
she
long
or
have
a
desire
to
any
thing
immediately
every
one
that
observes
it
are
ready
to
serve
her
with
it
nay
though
there
were
never
so
little
in
the
dish
her
longing
must
be
fully
satisfied
if
no
body
else
should
so
much
as
tast
of
it
and
by
this
means
oftentimes
the
good
woman
is
so
ill
and
disturbed
that
she
is
forced
to
rise
from
the
table
and
falls
from
one
faintness
into
another
which
for
civilities
sake
is
then
baptized
that
she
hath
sat
too
high
or
been
throng
or
that
the
room
being
so
full
the
breath
of
the
people
offended
her
and
though
she
perceives
that
this
very
food
makes
her
so
ill
yet
for
the
most
part
she
will
be
so
choice
and
so
dainty
that
she
seldom
knows
her
self
what
she
will
eat
or
hath
a
mind
to
but
generally
it
tends
to
some
thing
or
other
that
is
delicate
upon
this
manner
again
according
to
the
former
custom
she
tumbles
it
in
till
she
is
sick
with
it
and
if
any
one
looks
but
very
wishly
at
her
immediately
another
saies
to
them
she
must
eat
for
two
nay
perhaps
for
three
and
not
only
that
in
this
manner
she
grows
so
delicate
and
gluttonous
but
is
thereby
so
easie
and
lazy
that
she
can
hardly
longer
indure
her
sowing
cushion
upon
her
lap
also
sitting
is
not
good
for
her
for
fear
the
child
thereby
might
receive
some
hindrance
and
an
heartfullness
therefore
she
must
often
walk
abroad
and
to
that
end
an
occasion
is
found
to
go
every
day
a
pratling
and
gossiping
to
this
and
then
to
another
place
in
the
mean
while
leaving
her
husband
without
a
wife
and
the
family
without
a
mistris
then
in
conclusion
this
falls
also
burthensom
to
her
as
it
is
generally
with
all
things
that
are
too
frequently
used
then
she
will
be
for
spurring
you
up
to
walk
abroad
with
her
that
she
may
get
all
sorts
of
fruits
and
other
fopperies
that
the
season
of
the
year
affords
and
at
the
first
she
for
some
cream
with
sugar
stewd
prunes
and
a
bottle
of
sider
or
perry
and
thus
abroad
to
spend
much
and
at
home
neglect
more
if
she
have
then
gone
somthing
far
she
is
so
excessive
weary
with
it
that
if
her
life
must
ly
at
stake
she
can
not
set
one
foot
further
herewith
is
the
poor
man
absolutely
put
to
a
stand
ride
she
may
not
or
all
the
fat
would
be
in
the
fire
and
they
are
so
deep
in
the
country
that
there
is
somtimes
neither
coach
nor
boat
to
be
had
and
if
you
should
happen
to
be
where
a
river
is
there
never
a
boat
to
be
had
but
if
there
should
be
one
then
you
must
be
subject
to
humour
the
churlish
ferry
man
who
seeing
the
necessity
of
the
occasion
and
that
you
are
able
to
pay
for
it
will
have
what
price
he
pleases
and
somtimes
again
you
are
timorous
your
self
to
hazard
it
because
many
women
are
very
fearfull
upon
the
water
but
indeed
if
by
this
unhappy
occasion
a
good
expedient
may
be
found
to
please
your
dearly
beloved
it
is
no
small
joy
well
then
make
your
self
jocund
herewith
to
the
end
that
other
troubles
may
not
so
much
molest
and
disturb
you
you
may
also
be
very
well
assured
that
your
wife
no
sooner
comes
to
be
a
little
but
she
receives
the
priviledge
to
have
all
what
she
hath
a
mind
to
that
is
called
longing
and
what
husband
can
be
so
stern
or
barbarous
that
he
will
deny
his
wife
at
such
a
time
what
she
longs
for
especially
if
it
be
a
true
love
of
a
woman
you
must
never
hinder
her
of
her
longing
for
then
certainly
the
child
would
have
some
hindrance
by
it
forasmuch
then
as
is
necessary
that
you
alwaies
seek
to
avoid
and
prevent
this
you
must
observe
that
all
women
when
they
are
with
child
do
fall
commonly
from
one
longing
to
another
and
then
the
providing
and
buying
of
that
for
them
must
be
as
great
a
pleasure
to
you
as
it
is
to
them
in
the
receiving
and
use
of
it
and
that
not
alone
for
theirs
but
your
childs
sake
also
and
truly
he
that
will
or
can
not
suit
himself
to
this
humour
will
be
very
unhappy
because
he
shall
not
then
receive
the
full
scope
and
freedom
of
this
pleasure
it
is
also
most
certain
that
these
longing
desires
doth
transport
their
imaginations
from
one
finical
thing
to
another
if
it
be
in
the
summer
then
they
long
for
china
oranges
sivil
lemmons
the
largest
asparagus
strawberries
with
wine
and
sugar
cherries
of
all
sorts
and
in
like
manner
of
plums
and
these
they
must
have
their
fill
of
and
then
when
they
have
gotten
through
the
continuance
their
full
satisfaction
thereof
then
be
assured
they
begin
to
long
for
some
great
peaches
and
apricocks
and
though
they
be
never
so
scarce
and
dear
yet
the
woman
must
not
lose
her
longing
for
the
child
might
get
a
blemish
by
it
if
then
apples
and
pears
begin
to
grow
ripe
you
have
the
same
tune
to
sing
again
for
she
is
possessed
with
a
new
longing
desire
as
bad
as
if
it
were
a
quotidian
ague
in
all
the
joints
of
her
body
and
whatsoever
comes
new
to
her
sight
creates
in
her
a
fresh
longing
if
she
gets
one
hour
curious
catherine
pears
pippins
or
russetings
the
next
she
hath
a
mind
to
filberds
and
then
an
hour
or
two
later
wall
nuts
and
grapes
fall
into
her
thoughts
do
what
you
will
there
no
help
for
it
her
longing
must
be
satisfied
let
it
go
as
it
will
or
cost
what
it
will
and
this
her
longing
leads
her
from
one
thing
to
another
of
all
what
the
richness
of
the
summer
or
liberality
of
the
harvest
out
of
their
superfluities
pour
down
upon
us
insomuch
that
the
good
man
wishes
a
thousand
times
over
that
he
might
once
be
rid
of
these
terrible
charges
and
great
expence
but
alas
what
helps
it
there
no
season
of
the
year
but
gives
us
some
or
other
new
fruits
that
the
women
have
alwaies
a
new
longing
desire
to
and
if
it
be
in
the
winter
then
they
long
for
juicy
pomgranates
new
wine
upon
the
must
with
chesnuts
then
for
colchester
oisters
then
again
for
pancakes
and
fritters
and
indeed
for
a
thousand
several
sorts
of
such
toys
and
fancies
as
do
but
appear
before
their
longing
imaginations
and
oftentimes
it
is
no
real
longing
for
that
were
then
pardonable
but
a
liquorish
delicate
desire
that
they
are
sick
of
as
may
be
seen
by
those
who
simply
imagine
themselves
to
be
with
child
are
alwaies
talking
of
this
and
dainty
that
they
long
after
and
that
which
is
worst
of
all
is
that
both
they
and
those
that
are
really
with
child
long
commonly
for
that
which
is
scarcest
and
hardest
to
be
gotten
yea
in
the
very
middle
of
winter
they
oftentimes
long
to
have
a
greengoose
or
young
chickens
which
in
some
places
are
very
hard
to
be
got
and
not
without
paying
excessive
dear
for
them
this
longing
being
so
satisfied
immediately
arises
another
and
nothing
will
serve
but
meats
and
several
sorts
of
comfits
yea
how
often
happens
it
though
it
rain
snow
and
is
very
slippery
that
both
the
husband
and
the
maid
if
never
so
dark
and
late
in
the
night
must
trot
out
and
fetch
candied
ginger
dried
pears
gingerbread
or
some
such
sort
of
liquorish
thing
and
what
is
to
be
imagined
that
can
be
cried
about
in
the
streets
by
day
time
but
her
longing
before
hath
an
appetite
prepared
for
it
yea
through
an
excessive
eating
of
raw
fruits
and
feeding
upon
multiplicities
of
to
fulfill
their
longing
it
turns
to
a
griping
of
the
guts
and
overflowing
of
the
gall
which
again
occasion
cholick
manytimes
other
lamentable
pains
here
is
then
another
new
work
there
the
doctor
must
be
presently
fetcht
and
according
to
what
he
pleases
to
order
either
a
glister
must
be
set
or
some
other
physick
taken
for
it
but
by
reason
these
things
are
not
so
pleasant
to
the
good
woman
as
the
foregoing
liquorish
delicacies
she
thinks
it
best
that
the
midwife
be
sent
for
because
she
hath
a
great
deal
better
knowledge
touching
the
infirmities
of
women
then
the
doctors
then
she
is
fetcht
and
having
done
the
first
part
of
her
office
she
gives
her
good
comfort
and
orders
her
to
take
only
some
of
the
best
white
wine
simper
up
with
a
little
well
sweetned
with
sugar
and
so
warm
drunk
up
and
then
anoint
your
self
here
and
you
know
where
with
this
salve
and
for
medicines
that
are
most
to
be
found
in
confectionres
or
pasterers
shops
you
must
be
sure
to
make
use
of
those
then
your
pain
will
quickly
lessen
you
must
not
neglect
also
ofttimes
to
eat
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
with
either
caroway
or
aniseed
comfits
use
also
cinnamon
the
first
expels
wind
and
the
second
strengthens
the
heart
and
they
are
both
good
for
the
woman
and
the
child
be
sure
also
to
drink
every
morning
and
every
evening
a
glass
of
the
best
sack
for
that
strengthens
the
fruit
of
the
womb
and
occasions
you
a
good
quickness
who
will
doubt
but
that
she
obeys
the
orders
of
the
midwife
much
better
then
that
of
the
doctors
and
verily
there
is
also
a
great
deal
of
difference
in
the
suffering
of
such
or
uneasie
fumbling
at
the
back
part
or
the
receiving
of
such
pleasant
and
acceptable
ingredients
and
so
much
the
more
when
she
begins
to
remember
that
doctor
used
to
tell
her
that
medicins
never
make
so
good
an
operation
when
they
are
at
any
time
taken
against
the
appetite
or
with
an
antipathy
by
the
patient
thus
you
may
see
approaching
father
how
you
are
now
climb
up
to
a
higher
step
of
glory
your
manly
deeds
make
your
name
renowned
and
your
joy
is
so
much
augmented
that
your
wife
looks
alwaies
merrily
and
pleasantly
upon
you
for
giving
her
content
and
she
now
also
salutes
you
with
the
most
sweetest
and
kindest
names
imaginable
you
must
also
now
be
her
guest
upon
all
sorts
of
summer
and
winter
fruits
a
thousand
other
kinds
of
liquorish
and
most
acceptable
dainties
insomuch
that
although
you
did
not
come
into
the
streets
in
six
months
you
may
by
the
humour
and
actions
of
your
wife
know
perfectly
when
strawberries
cherries
apples
pears
nuts
grapes
are
in
season
and
there
is
no
greater
pleasure
for
your
best
beloved
then
that
she
sees
you
eat
as
heartily
of
them
as
she
her
self
doth
confess
then
unfeignedly
from
the
very
bottom
of
your
heart
are
not
these
great
pleasures
of
marriage
and
be
joyfull
for
this
is
only
a
beginning
the
best
comes
at
last
know
likewise
that
this
is
but
as
a
of
the
sixth
pleasure
and
will
both
touch
you
at
heart
and
tickle
your
purse
much
better
yea
insomuch
that
the
experience
thereof
will
shew
you
that
there
is
a
whole
mountain
of
pleasures
to
be
found
in
the
bands
of
wedlock
whereby
i
fear
that
you
will
perhaps
make
a
lamentable
complaint
of
your
no
sooner
arriving
at
this
happiness
but
comfort
your
self
herewith
that
the
medicaments
of
the
doctor
and
midwife
perhaps
have
done
such
a
wished
for
operation
that
you
thereby
may
obtain
many
sons
and
daughters
which
you
may
then
timely
admonish
and
instruct
to
that
duty
so
long
by
your
self
neglected
and
in
a
manner
too
late
to
repent
of
doubt
not
but
assuredly
beleeve
that
now
you
are
once
gotten
into
the
right
road
you
may
easily
every
year
see
a
renovation
of
this
unspeakable
pleasure
and
beholding
your
wife
oftentimes
in
this
state
in
like
manner
you
perceive
that
not
only
your
name
and
fame
is
spread
abroad
but
your
generation
also
grow
formidable
and
this
all
to
the
glory
of
your
relations
and
joy
of
your
dearly
beloved
illustration
folio
by
the
navarre
society
the
sixth
pleasure
is
taking
for
the
child
and
linnen
and
to
provide
a
midwife
and
in
good
truth
it
is
very
pleasant
to
see
how
the
good
womans
apron
from
day
to
day
how
longer
the
more
it
rises
now
all
the
world
may
plainly
see
you
have
behaved
your
self
like
a
man
and
every
one
acknowledge
that
you
are
both
good
for
the
sport
verily
this
is
a
great
pleasure
and
it
increases
abundantly
when
your
wife
comes
to
be
so
near
her
reckoning
that
she
feels
her
self
quick
and
begins
to
provide
and
take
care
for
the
childs
and
linnen
then
you
need
not
fear
the
turning
of
the
tide
or
that
a
mischance
will
happen
wherewith
all
people
seeing
no
other
issue
laugh
and
scoff
unmeasurably
and
think
that
the
midwife
hath
been
greased
in
the
fist
as
it
oftentimes
happens
because
she
should
say
that
it
was
a
full
created
child
and
no
collection
of
ill
humors
or
a
and
the
greatest
joy
is
that
you
have
now
so
hoisted
your
that
your
wife
can
not
any
more
call
you
a
or
a
which
were
for
you
such
disrespectfull
names
and
yet
for
quietness
sake
you
were
forced
to
smother
them
in
your
breast
because
you
could
have
no
witnesse
for
your
vindication
you
are
now
so
far
exalted
that
you
will
very
speedily
be
saluted
with
the
name
of
which
is
as
pleasing
and
acceptable
for
you
now
as
the
name
of
was
before
o
how
happy
you
are
what
pleasures
doth
the
married
estate
provide
for
you
how
glad
must
your
wife
be
now
how
strictly
she
reckons
the
months
nay
the
very
weeks
and
days
o
what
an
unexpressible
love
hath
she
for
you
now
and
with
what
imbraces
and
kisses
she
entertains
you
because
you
have
furnish
her
shop
so
well
now
you
may
perceive
that
the
procreating
of
children
makes
the
band
of
wedlock
much
stronger
and
increaseth
the
affections
now
were
it
well
time
that
by
death
either
of
the
good
woman
or
the
child
that
you
did
by
a
will
seek
the
mortification
of
the
disadvantagious
contract
of
marriage
and
by
that
means
get
all
there
is
to
your
self
in
place
of
going
back
to
her
friends
and
relations
but
alas
she
hath
so
much
in
her
head
at
present
that
there
is
no
speaking
to
her
about
it
without
being
a
great
trouble
to
her
besides
her
sences
can
not
now
bear
it
therefore
you
must
let
it
alone
till
another
time
do
you
your
self
but
observe
quickly
see
that
a
requireth
so
much
trimming
that
she
hath
really
care
enough
upon
her
the
linnen
alone
is
a
thing
that
would
make
ones
head
full
of
dizziness
it
consists
of
so
many
sorts
of
i
will
not
so
much
as
name
all
the
other
jinkombobs
that
are
dependances
to
it
therefore
ought
you
to
be
so
compassionate
with
her
as
not
to
speak
to
her
about
any
other
thing
for
all
her
mind
and
sences
are
so
imploied
upon
that
subject
that
she
can
think
upon
nothing
else
but
her
hear
but
deliberately
to
all
her
and
of
what
belongs
to
it
tis
no
wonder
neither
for
there
is
not
one
of
her
acquaintance
comes
to
her
either
woman
or
maid
but
they
presently
ask
her
well
mistris
when
do
you
reckon
and
that
is
a
text
then
so
full
of
matter
that
there
is
oftentimes
three
or
four
hours
preacht
upon
it
before
any
of
the
auditors
be
weary
o
that
all
ministers
were
so
happy
as
to
have
alwaies
such
earnest
and
serious
hearers
in
the
mean
while
there
is
no
body
happier
than
the
maids
for
they
are
then
free
from
being
the
for
at
other
times
the
first
word
is
how
do
you
like
your
maid
which
is
another
text
that
the
women
generally
preach
out
of
and
make
longest
sermons
in
but
methinks
i
should
happen
to
fall
here
from
the
mistris
upon
the
maid
to
go
forward
then
see
how
serious
your
dearest
is
with
the
semstress
contriving
how
much
linnen
she
must
buy
to
make
all
her
linnen
as
it
ought
to
be
how
diligently
she
measures
the
beds
bellibands
navel
clouts
shirts
and
all
other
trincom
trancoms
and
she
keeps
as
exact
an
account
of
the
ells
half
ells
quarters
and
lesser
measures
as
if
she
had
gone
seven
years
to
school
to
learn
casting
of
an
account
let
this
measuring
and
reckoning
be
pleasant
to
you
because
the
charge
thereof
will
fall
costly
enough
for
you
to
morrow
she
goes
to
market
to
buy
two
or
three
pieces
of
linnen
one
whereof
must
be
very
fine
and
the
other
a
little
courser
and
you
need
not
take
any
notice
what
quantity
of
fine
small
laces
she
hath
occasion
for
by
reason
it
might
perhaps
overcloud
this
sixth
pleasure
of
marriage
which
you
now
possess
why
should
you
not
be
merry
you
have
now
above
all
things
a
wife
to
your
mind
who
whatsoever
she
imagines
desires
or
doth
it
is
alwaies
accompanied
with
wishes
o
saies
she
how
glad
shall
i
be
when
all
things
is
bought
that
there
ought
to
be
for
the
making
of
my
linnen
and
no
sooner
is
it
bought
but
then
she
wishes
that
it
were
made
but
this
requires
some
time
and
then
have
reason
to
rejoice
for
it
is
commonly
the
usual
custom
of
the
semstresses
to
let
you
go
and
run
after
them
and
fop
you
off
with
lies
and
stories
till
the
time
be
so
nigh
at
hand
that
it
will
admit
no
longer
delay
yet
before
you
see
that
your
wife
hath
accomplisht
this
desire
find
her
very
much
troubled
at
two
several
causes
which
will
make
you
glad
when
she
hath
once
obtained
them
for
these
are
things
of
importance
to
wit
the
making
choice
of
a
midwife
and
a
nurse
because
upon
one
depends
the
health
and
preservation
of
the
life
of
the
woman
and
on
the
other
that
of
the
child
let
it
no
waies
molest
or
trouble
you
but
rather
be
pleasing
and
acceptable
if
she
be
continually
chattering
at
you
and
desiring
your
advice
and
councell
who
she
shall
make
choice
of
or
not
hereby
you
may
observe
that
you
have
a
very
carefull
wife
and
if
you
listen
a
little
more
narrowly
you
will
hear
what
a
special
care
she
hath
for
all
things
then
she
will
every
day
be
relating
to
you
that
amongst
the
number
of
midwives
which
have
been
recommended
to
her
there
is
not
one
that
pleases
her
for
one
is
too
young
and
unexperienced
another
is
too
old
and
doting
a
third
is
too
big
handed
a
fourth
hath
too
much
talk
and
the
fifth
drinks
too
much
wine
to
be
short
there
is
so
many
deficiencies
in
every
one
of
them
that
the
good
woman
hath
need
of
a
learned
counsellors
advice
to
help
her
to
chuse
the
best
and
the
like
trouble
hath
she
also
concerning
the
taking
of
a
nurse
having
already
spent
above
a
months
time
in
examining
among
her
kindred
and
relations
and
other
good
acquaintance
how
such
and
such
nurses
have
behaved
themselves
she
is
informed
that
there
are
few
to
be
found
but
have
certainly
some
faults
or
other
and
somtimes
very
great
ones
for
one
is
too
sluttish
another
saunters
too
much
a
third
too
lazy
another
too
dainty
and
then
again
one
eats
too
much
and
another
drinks
too
much
one
keeps
company
too
much
with
the
maid
and
another
in
like
manner
with
the
good
man
and
such
a
one
or
such
a
one
are
the
best
but
they
were
not
very
handy
about
the
hearth
to
make
ready
some
liquorish
dainty
things
for
the
good
woman
which
is
a
matter
of
no
small
weight
behold
hath
she
not
very
great
cause
to
be
troubled
and
thereout
you
may
very
well
also
observe
how
happy
you
are
seeing
you
have
gotten
a
wife
that
night
and
day
is
busie
and
taking
care
of
all
these
concerns
and
other
affairs
yes
verily
although
her
be
very
cumbersom
to
her
yet
she
must
be
abroad
every
day
from
morning
till
evening
to
take
care
and
provide
all
these
important
things
that
nothing
may
be
wanting
well
what
a
carefull
wife
you
have
how
mightily
she
is
concerned
for
this
above
all
other
things
whatsoever
and
scarcely
hath
the
good
woman
gotten
these
two
main
instruments
but
she
finds
her
self
still
involved
in
so
much
other
business
that
she
hardly
can
tell
how
to
do
or
turn
her
self
in
it
for
now
there
wants
a
groaning
stool
a
screen
and
a
cradle
with
what
belongs
to
it
and
heaven
knows
what
more
which
have
been
so
long
neglected
with
the
care
that
was
taking
to
get
a
midwife
and
a
nurse
then
again
there
wants
new
hangings
a
a
silver
candle
sticks
a
that
of
necessity
must
be
bought
used
at
the
gossips
feast
so
that
the
good
man
need
not
fear
that
his
mony
will
grow
mouldy
for
want
of
being
turned
too
again
oh
were
your
dear
wife
so
happy
that
she
had
once
made
an
end
of
all
these
ponderous
affairs
then
all
would
be
well
for
then
she
could
begin
to
give
order
for
the
making
clean
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
and
for
the
pressing
of
some
curtains
vallians
and
hangings
the
rubbing
of
stools
chairs
and
cupboard
the
scouring
of
the
and
and
is
no
wonder
for
when
the
good
woman
lies
in
then
come
so
many
busie
bodies
that
with
their
glouring
eyes
are
peeping
into
every
hole
and
corner
these
things
do
so
excessively
trouble
her
brain
that
she
can
hardly
the
whole
day
think
upon
any
thing
else
yea
goes
so
near
her
that
it
oftentimes
totally
bereaves
her
of
her
nights
rest
insomuch
that
she
is
fain
to
ly
very
long
abed
in
the
morning
and
if
by
night
she
happen
but
only
to
think
of
boobincjo
she
hath
immediately
such
an
alteration
in
her
very
intrals
that
she
feels
here
or
there
some
or
other
deficiency
which
comes
so
vehement
upon
her
that
the
poor
husband
though
it
be
never
so
cold
must
out
of
bed
to
fetch
some
cinnamon
and
water
or
good
sack
or
else
some
other
such
sort
of
those
liquorish
ingredients
and
then
these
are
the
principal
keys
of
musick
that
the
whole
night
through
are
sung
and
plaid
upon
o
how
happy
is
the
good
man
that
he
hath
from
time
to
time
in
her
learned
all
these
things
with
so
much
patience
which
makes
him
now
that
he
can
the
better
bear
with
all
these
finical
humours
but
for
this
again
o
compassionate
you
shall
have
not
only
great
commendations
for
your
patience
but
the
pleasure
also
that
some
of
your
nearest
relations
will
come
and
kiss
your
hands
and
withall
tell
you
how
happy
you
are
that
almost
arrived
at
that
noble
degree
of
being
intituled
father
and
then
with
great
respect
reverence
they
desire
to
receive
the
honour
some
of
being
your
childs
and
others
to
be
neither
will
they
then
be
behind
hand
in
presenting
the
child
with
several
liberal
gifts
as
an
acknowledgement
of
the
honour
they
receive
above
others
in
being
favoured
with
your
gossipship
well
who
would
not
for
so
much
honour
and
respect
but
now
and
then
suffer
the
trouble
of
his
wives
quamish
stomack
with
some
charges
and
more
then
that
you
have
now
the
best
opportunity
in
the
world
to
go
with
your
new
chosen
gossips
as
you
did
before
with
your
bridemen
chuse
taste
out
some
of
the
most
delicious
wine
for
you
must
be
sure
to
store
your
cellar
well
because
then
both
the
bridemen
and
will
certainly
come
to
eat
some
of
the
for
caudle
besides
the
great
number
of
friends
that
will
come
then
also
to
give
you
a
visit
and
with
all
respect
wish
you
much
joy
i
will
not
so
much
as
think
any
thing
of
those
that
will
come
also
to
the
christning
and
gossips
feast
be
joyfull
with
this
till
such
time
as
the
pleasure
begins
to
appear
the
seventh
pleasure
woman
falls
in
behold
young
couple
hitherto
a
considerable
deal
of
time
is
spent
and
passed
over
with
the
aforesaid
mirth
and
pleasures
do
not
you
now
perceive
what
a
vast
difference
is
between
the
married
or
unmarried
estate
you
have
by
provision
made
your
self
master
of
these
six
pleasures
nay
oftentimes
before
you
have
gotten
the
joy
of
the
fourth
pleasure
appears
that
of
the
seventh
very
unexpectedly
for
the
good
woman
begins
to
look
so
sour
grumble
grunt
and
groan
that
it
seems
as
if
she
would
go
into
the
garden
and
fetch
a
babe
out
of
the
but
this
is
a
for
a
little
while
ago
she
said
that
she
was
but
seventh
months
gone
of
her
reckoning
how
then
should
she
have
jested
upon
it
or
has
the
good
woman
lost
her
book
and
so
made
a
false
account
yet
this
being
the
first
time
of
her
reckoning
ought
the
more
favourably
to
be
passed
by
as
long
as
the
trade
goes
forwards
illustration
folio
by
the
navarre
society
there
now
no
small
alarm
in
the
watch
who
is
there
that
is
but
near
or
by
the
hand
that
is
not
set
a
work
oh
was
dorothy
the
semstress
and
jane
the
laundress
now
here
what
a
helping
hand
we
might
have
of
them
where
are
now
the
two
also
they
were
commonly
every
day
about
the
house
and
now
we
stand
in
such
terrible
need
of
them
they
are
not
to
be
found
herewith
must
the
poor
drone
very
unexpectedly
get
out
of
bed
almost
stark
naked
having
hardly
time
to
put
on
his
shoes
and
stockins
for
the
labour
comes
so
pressing
upon
her
that
it
is
nothing
but
hast
hast
hast
fetch
the
midwife
with
all
possible
speed
and
alas
there
is
so
many
several
occasions
for
help
that
she
can
not
miss
her
maid
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
neither
dare
she
trust
it
to
the
maids
fetching
for
fear
she
should
not
find
the
midwives
house
and
she
hath
not
shewed
it
her
because
she
made
her
reckoning
that
she
had
yet
two
months
more
to
go
therefore
without
denial
away
the
good
man
himself
must
to
fetch
the
midwife
for
who
knows
whether
or
no
she
would
come
so
quick
if
the
maid
went
nay
it
is
a
question
also
being
so
late
in
the
night
whether
she
would
come
along
with
the
maid
alone
because
she
dwells
in
a
very
solitary
corner
clearly
at
the
end
of
the
city
for
after
a
ripe
deliberation
of
the
good
woman
the
lot
fell
so
that
she
made
choice
of
this
grave
and
experienced
midwife
away
runs
the
poor
man
without
stop
or
stay
as
if
he
were
running
for
a
wager
of
some
great
concern
and
though
it
be
never
so
cold
the
sweat
trickles
down
by
the
hair
of
his
head
for
fear
he
should
not
find
the
midwife
at
home
or
that
perhaps
she
might
be
fetcht
out
to
some
other
place
from
whence
she
could
not
come
and
if
it
should
happen
so
we
are
all
undone
for
the
good
woman
must
have
this
midwife
or
else
she
dies
neither
can
or
dare
she
condescend
to
take
any
of
the
other
for
the
reasons
afore
mentioned
but
what
remedy
if
there
must
come
another
then
she
will
so
alter
vex
and
fret
her
self
at
it
that
all
the
provocations
of
pains
in
labour
turns
against
her
stomack
and
there
is
no
hopes
further
for
that
time
but
whilest
you
are
running
and
consider
in
this
manner
hope
the
best
rather
think
with
your
self
what
great
joy
is
approaching
unto
you
if
your
wife
thus
soon
come
to
be
safely
delivered
of
a
hopefull
son
or
daughter
in
the
first
place
you
will
be
freed
from
all
that
trouble
of
rising
in
the
night
and
from
the
hearing
of
the
grumbling
and
mumbling
of
your
wife
two
months
sooner
then
you
your
self
did
expect
you
should
have
been
be
not
discomforted
although
she
doth
thus
unexpectedly
force
you
out
of
bed
before
you
have
hardly
slept
an
hour
for
you
see
great
occasion
and
now
is
the
time
to
show
that
you
truly
love
your
wife
this
first
time
will
make
it
more
accustomary
the
first
is
also
commonly
the
worst
and
if
you
be
so
fortunate
that
at
the
very
first
you
happen
to
meet
with
this
prudent
and
grave
matron
midwife
do
bring
her
to
your
dearly
beloved
wife
yet
nevertheless
you
may
assure
your
self
that
before
you
can
arrive
to
have
the
full
scope
and
heighth
of
this
pleasure
find
something
more
to
do
for
the
midwife
is
not
able
alone
to
govern
and
take
care
of
all
things
that
must
be
fetcht
brought
and
carried
to
and
again
therefore
of
necessity
the
friends
must
be
fetcht
with
all
the
speed
imaginable
viz
sisters
wives
aunts
cousins
and
several
familiar
good
acquaintances
must
have
notice
of
it
and
be
defraied
to
come
to
her
quickly
quickly
without
any
delay
and
if
you
do
not
invite
them
very
ceremonially
every
one
according
to
their
degrees
and
qualities
it
is
taken
to
be
no
small
affront
it
hath
hapned
more
then
a
hundred
times
that
the
sister
afterwards
would
not
come
to
the
christning
feast
because
by
chance
she
heard
that
the
brothers
wife
had
notice
given
her
of
the
before
her
self
little
considering
how
few
people
the
young
people
had
in
the
night
to
assist
them
or
that
the
confusion
and
unexperiencedness
was
the
occasion
that
they
did
not
think
of
such
a
method
or
order
nay
oftentimes
is
this
sort
of
jealousie
arisen
between
the
aunt
and
cousin
whereby
may
most
certainly
be
observed
the
intelligibility
of
the
most
prudent
female
sex
is
true
this
running
seems
both
troublesom
and
tiresom
but
little
doth
the
good
man
know
that
he
is
now
first
come
into
that
noble
school
herein
his
patience
shall
be
effectually
exercised
or
that
this
is
but
the
first
year
of
trying
the
same
o
how
happy
are
they
that
are
well
instructed
in
it
do
but
see
how
impatient
the
good
expecting
father
is
what
is
there
not
yet
wanting
before
he
hath
his
lesson
perfect
behold
the
poor
drone
how
he
moves
too
fro
see
what
a
loss
and
tostication
he
is
in
he
tramples
his
hat
under
his
feet
pulls
the
hair
off
his
head
not
knowing
what
he
would
do
or
which
way
to
help
his
dear
wife
and
the
friends
that
were
sent
for
do
not
come
so
quick
as
he
expected
because
the
most
part
of
them
must
first
trick
and
prick
themselves
up
before
that
they
dare
come
the
one
fearing
the
piercing
view
of
another
though
they
be
all
near
relations
and
friends
here
he
stands
trembling
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
himself
womens
assistance
is
at
this
present
most
requisite
and
a
good
stierman
at
stern
or
the
ship
may
run
upon
a
sand
she
runs
first
backwards
then
forwards
seeks
here
then
there
and
although
he
hath
the
keys
of
all
the
chests
and
trunks
his
head
runs
so
much
a
wool
gathering
that
let
him
do
what
he
will
he
can
find
no
sort
of
those
things
he
most
stands
in
need
of
alas
all
things
is
thus
out
of
order
by
reason
the
good
woman
did
not
think
to
come
so
soon
in
childbed
oh
what
manner
of
jinkinbobs
are
not
here
wanting
that
are
most
useful
at
this
occasion
and
the
midwife
cries
and
bawls
for
them
that
she
hoarse
again
here
both
the
and
the
screen
yet
to
be
made
and
mistris
hath
them
both
but
they
are
lent
out
yonder
peg
the
maid
runs
her
anckle
out
of
joint
and
her
self
out
of
breath
to
desire
to
borrow
them
of
mistris
and
hardly
gotten
out
of
dores
before
they
perceive
that
the
warming
pan
is
yet
to
be
bought
and
that
that
worst
of
all
is
that
all
the
linnen
is
not
yet
starch
or
iron
oftentimes
it
happens
that
it
is
yet
upon
the
bankside
at
bleach
what
a
miserable
condition
is
this
here
the
good
man
is
at
no
small
quandary
with
all
the
women
oh
were
this
the
greatest
disappointment
for
him
but
presently
he
sees
all
the
womens
countenances
looking
very
and
mournfully
at
each
other
one
beginning
to
pray
another
to
cry
in
there
comes
a
great
alteration
in
the
pangs
and
pains
of
her
labour
nay
they
are
so
desperate
that
the
fear
is
either
the
mother
or
the
child
or
perhaps
both
must
go
to
pot
for
all
whatsoever
the
doctor
hath
prescribed
or
that
hath
been
fetcht
from
the
apothecaries
nay
the
very
girdle
of
saint
can
work
here
no
miracle
uds
bud
this
is
but
a
sad
spectacle
oh
says
peg
the
maid
doth
this
come
by
marrying
never
venture
it
as
long
as
i
live
i
do
beleeve
that
it
is
very
pleasurable
to
ly
with
a
gentleman
but
the
hath
no
delight
at
all
in
it
oh
i
am
affraid
if
there
come
not
a
sudden
change
that
my
good
mistris
will
not
be
able
to
undergo
it
oh
sweet
pretty
blossom
as
she
is
is
most
true
that
here
wants
crums
of
comfort
both
for
the
husband
and
the
wife
yea
for
the
midwife
and
all
the
rest
of
the
women
beside
for
they
all
cry
that
the
tears
run
streaming
down
their
cheeks
and
neither
their
nor
burnt
wine
can
any
waies
refresh
or
strengthen
her
if
there
come
no
other
tiding
the
sweetness
of
this
pleasure
will
prove
but
bitter
to
them
but
hark
a
little
there
comes
something
of
a
tiding
that
brings
us
five
pounds
worth
of
courage
with
it
two
or
three
more
such
would
make
every
one
of
our
hearts
a
hundred
pound
lighter
and
the
great
caudle
skellet
would
begin
to
quake
and
tremble
pray
have
a
little
patience
tarry
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
you
shall
be
presented
with
a
child
and
saluted
with
the
title
of
father
the
eighth
pleasure
womans
brought
to
ha
boys
after
all
the
toiling
the
happy
hour
is
at
last
arrived
that
the
good
woman
finally
is
delivered
brought
to
bed
well
this
is
a
mirth
and
pleasure
that
far
surpasseth
all
the
other
for
the
good
man
is
by
a
whole
estate
richer
than
he
was
before
who
can
imagine
or
comprehend
the
jollity
of
this
new
father
o
he
is
so
overjoyed
that
it
is
inexpressible
doll
and
peg
must
out
immediately
to
give
notice
of
it
to
all
the
friends
and
acquaintance
thinking
to
himself
that
every
body
else
will
be
as
jocund
and
merry
at
it
as
he
is
do
but
see
how
busie
he
is
behold
with
what
earnestness
he
runs
up
and
down
the
house
to
give
order
that
the
great
caudle
skillet
may
be
in
a
readiness
illustration
folio
by
the
navarre
society
what
a
pleasure
is
it
for
him
that
he
sees
mistris
attending
the
midwife
and
giving
her
all
manner
of
warmed
beds
and
other
clouts
the
number
and
names
whereof
are
without
end
and
that
mistris
mistris
are
tumbling
all
things
forsooth
to
seek
and
prepare
in
a
readiness
all
those
things
that
are
most
necessary
for
the
child
but
little
doth
he
think
that
they
do
it
more
to
be
peeping
into
every
hole
and
corner
and
to
have
a
full
view
of
all
the
linnen
then
out
of
needfull
assistance
and
wo
be
to
the
woman
if
they
do
but
find
any
where
a
clout
napkin
or
towel
that
by
chance
hath
either
a
hole
or
a
rent
in
it
for
one
or
another
of
them
will
with
grinning
and
laughing
thrust
her
finger
through
it
and
then
shew
it
to
the
rest
taking
also
the
first
opportunity
she
can
lay
hold
of
when
they
are
a
little
at
liberty
to
make
a
whole
about
it
and
very
much
admireth
the
carelessness
and
negligence
of
the
woman
as
if
she
were
a
greater
and
worse
than
any
of
them
else
when
to
the
contrary
if
you
should
by
accident
come
into
any
of
their
garrets
when
the
linnen
is
just
come
home
from
washing
you
would
oftentimes
find
it
in
such
a
condition
that
you
might
very
well
imagine
your
self
to
be
in
westminster
hall
where
the
colours
that
are
trophies
of
honour
are
hung
up
one
full
of
holes
another
tatter
torn
and
a
third
full
of
mildew
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
peeping
and
snuffling
in
to
every
nook
and
corner
they
finally
get
the
child
swathled
and
then
to
the
great
joy
of
the
father
it
must
be
presented
him
in
state
by
the
midwife
with
this
golden
expression
a
proverb
not
above
two
hundred
years
old
see
there
is
your
child
god
give
you
much
joy
with
it
or
take
it
speedily
into
his
uds
bud
how
doth
this
tickle
him
what
a
new
mirth
and
pleasure
is
this
again
see
him
now
stand
there
and
look
like
a
monky
with
a
cat
in
his
arms
o
what
a
delicate
pretty
condition
he
now
in
well
midwife
look
for
this
joy
hath
taken
such
a
tyrannical
possession
of
his
heart
that
doubt
not
but
immediately
there
will
be
a
good
present
for
you
when
he
gives
it
you
back
again
is
no
wonder
for
if
it
be
a
son
he
is
at
least
a
thousand
pound
richer
then
he
was
before
though
he
may
look
long
enough
before
find
a
bankers
bond
in
his
chest
for
the
sum
now
whilest
the
child
is
swadled
and
drest
up
all
the
other
trinkum
trankums
are
laid
aside
and
the
table
is
spread
neatly
to
entertain
the
friends
who
not
alone
for
novelties
sake
but
also
out
of
a
sweet
tooth
liquorish
appetite
long
to
see
what
is
prepared
for
them
and
i
beleeve
that
although
the
kings
cook
had
drest
it
yet
there
will
be
one
or
another
of
them
that
will
be
discommending
something
and
brag
that
she
could
have
made
it
much
delicater
if
there
be
then
any
one
that
seems
not
fully
to
beleeve
her
immediately
she
cites
two
or
three
ladies
for
her
witnesses
who
have
given
her
the
greatest
praise
and
commendations
for
her
dressing
of
such
dishes
above
all
others
and
who
can
have
better
judgement
than
they
this
is
then
a
discourse
for
at
least
three
hours
for
they
are
all
of
them
so
well
verst
in
the
kitchin
affairs
that
its
hard
for
one
to
get
a
turn
to
speak
before
the
other
but
this
is
an
extraordinary
pleasure
for
this
new
father
to
hear
out
of
all
their
prittle
pratlings
how
sweetly
they
will
commend
the
quill
that
hath
received
all
the
colchester
oisters
sweetbreads
and
many
other
such
like
things
for
they
have
found
by
experience
that
such
sort
of
ingredients
occasion
very
much
the
kindness
of
men
to
their
wives
yes
yes
saies
rs
it
is
very
good
for
my
husband
and
not
amiss
for
any
pallate
neither
and
i
sure
the
better
i
feed
my
pig
the
better
it
is
for
me
in
the
soucing
out
and
this
discourse
then
is
held
up
with
such
an
earnestness
and
continues
so
long
that
the
woman
almost
gets
an
ague
with
it
or
at
the
least
falls
from
one
swooning
into
another
whilest
there
is
not
so
much
as
any
one
that
thinks
upon
her
happy
is
the
good
man
if
he
can
but
act
the
part
of
a
ninny
and
hath
busied
himself
for
the
most
part
in
the
kitchin
then
he
may
be
now
and
then
admitted
to
cast
in
his
verdict
otherwise
let
them
talk
as
long
as
they
will
he
is
forced
in
great
misery
to
afford
them
audience
but
it
is
much
better
for
him
if
according
as
the
occasion
gives
opportunity
there
be
now
and
then
spoken
something
concerning
the
woman
or
about
the
shaking
of
the
sheets
which
is
seldom
forgotten
because
he
is
now
already
so
far
advanced
in
the
of
that
school
that
he
is
gotten
up
to
the
water
bucket
in
the
mean
while
peg
runs
too
and
again
almost
like
one
out
of
her
sences
to
hunt
for
the
nurse
who
dwels
in
a
little
street
upon
a
or
in
an
ally
or
some
other
and
she
is
just
now
no
where
else
to
be
found
but
at
end
of
the
city
there
keeping
another
gentle
woman
in
here
is
now
again
other
fish
to
fry
for
one
will
not
be
without
her
and
must
needs
have
her
each
pretending
to
have
an
equal
right
to
her
and
the
nurse
finding
that
each
of
them
so
much
desires
her
thinks
no
small
matter
of
her
self
but
that
she
is
as
wise
as
many
a
ladies
woman
or
salomons
cat
and
that
her
fellow
is
hardly
to
be
found
but
before
some
few
daies
are
past
there
a
great
trial
to
be
made
of
the
nurses
experience
and
understanding
for
let
them
do
what
they
will
or
can
the
child
will
not
suck
yea
and
what
worse
it
hath
gotten
a
lamentable
thrush
alas
a
day
what
bad
work
is
here
again
the
nurse
is
so
quamish
stomackt
that
she
can
not
suck
her
mistres
therefore
care
must
be
taken
to
find
out
some
body
or
other
that
will
come
and
suck
the
young
womans
breasts
for
twelve
pence
a
time
or
else
her
breasts
will
grow
hard
with
lumps
and
fester
for
want
of
being
drawn
or
else
also
with
the
sucking
she
gets
in
the
tipples
now
is
the
right
time
to
fetch
the
apothecary
to
make
ready
plaisters
and
bring
to
raise
the
milk
that
the
lumps
may
be
driven
away
and
most
especially
that
the
cloves
in
the
tipples
may
be
cured
help
now
or
never
good
r
doctor
for
if
this
continue
much
longer
the
young
woman
perhaps
gets
an
ague
that
may
then
cost
her
her
life
verily
in
this
state
and
condition
of
the
woman
is
also
some
pleasure
to
be
found
for
you
may
keep
your
wife
now
very
cheap
she
is
not
now
so
liquorish
and
as
when
she
was
with
child
which
in
deed
is
very
good
at
all
times
but
most
especially
in
this
pittifull
time
for
there
now
nothing
fitter
for
her
to
eat
then
a
little
good
broth
stew
prunes
caudle
roasted
apples
or
new
laid
egs
but
now
father
your
pleasure
will
immediately
be
augmented
for
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
will
have
some
or
other
gentlewomen
come
to
give
you
a
visit
who
will
then
also
out
of
their
closets
of
understanding
be
very
much
assistant
to
you
with
their
advice
and
counsel
for
there
are
very
few
of
them
that
are
not
deeply
experienced
in
sir
and
if
any
thing
do
happen
more
then
ordinary
they
never
want
for
remedies
now
there
is
doctor
wife
who
by
her
own
experimenting
hath
knowledge
of
several
other
things
but
upon
such
an
occasion
as
this
there
is
nothing
better
then
that
the
child
must
be
glister
and
for
the
lumps
you
must
indevour
through
a
continual
chafing
to
get
them
out
of
the
young
womans
breasts
but
mistris
relates
how
miserably
she
was
troubled
with
an
humour
in
her
breast
when
she
lay
in
but
that
she
had
alwaies
cured
her
self
of
it
by
only
taking
a
sandwich
carrot
and
scraping
it
hollow
in
the
inside
and
then
put
like
a
hat
upon
the
tipple
this
drew
out
all
ill
humour
without
any
pain
or
the
least
fear
of
danger
yes
truly
saith
mrs
i
do
indeed
forsooth
beleeve
that
that
is
very
good
but
here
are
very
sore
nipples
and
they
begin
to
be
chop
and
there
must
be
a
special
care
taken
for
that
therefore
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
strengthen
the
nipples
with
a
little
and
then
wash
them
with
some
rosewater
that
hath
kernels
of
limons
steep
in
it
there
nothing
like
it
or
better
i
have
lain
in
of
thirteen
children
but
never
tried
any
thing
that
did
me
so
much
good
or
gave
me
half
the
ease
pray
dear
mistris
be
sure
to
make
use
of
that
you
will
never
repent
it
but
mistris
saith
that
she
hath
made
use
of
this
also
and
found
some
ease
by
it
and
that
she
hath
tried
above
an
hundred
other
things
that
were
approved
to
be
good
yet
of
all
things
never
found
nothing
under
the
sun
that
was
more
noble
then
salve
for
that
cures
immediately
and
you
can
have
nothing
better
yet
mistris
begins
to
relate
wonderfull
operations
done
with
oyl
of
myrrhe
and
of
the
plaisters
that
are
made
by
the
gentlewoman
in
now
comes
the
sage
matron
experience
saying
that
she
hath
learnt
a
secret
from
a
prudent
doctor
that
worth
its
weight
in
gold
nor
can
the
vertue
thereof
be
too
much
commended
and
she
hath
already
communicated
it
unto
several
persons
but
there
are
none
that
tried
it
who
do
not
praise
it
to
be
incomparable
therefore
she
hath
been
very
vigilant
to
note
it
down
in
and
works
to
the
end
that
her
posterity
may
not
only
make
use
of
it
but
participate
it
to
others
this
is
prepared
mingled
with
a
small
quantity
of
and
then
temper
them
together
with
the
point
of
a
knife
upon
an
earthen
plate
just
as
the
picture
drawers
do
their
colours
upon
their
pallet
which
will
bring
it
to
be
a
delicate
salve
and
is
also
very
soft
and
supple
for
the
chops
of
the
tipples
nay
though
the
child
should
suck
it
in
yet
it
doth
it
no
harm
and
it
doth
not
alone
cure
them
but
prevents
the
coming
of
any
more
yes
saith
mistris
to
and
my
advice
is
then
to
take
a
little
horn
with
a
sheeps
udder
lay
that
upon
the
tipples
for
that
defends
them
and
occasions
their
curing
much
better
and
sooner
o
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
hear
all
the
pretty
considerations
of
so
many
prudent
doctresses
if
might
but
revive
i
am
sure
he
would
find
here
as
many
doctresses
as
ever
there
were
doctors
at
paris
but
o
how
happy
will
this
fortunate
new
father
be
when
he
may
but
once
see
the
of
all
these
grave
and
nice
doctresses
but
my
truth
this
may
very
well
be
registred
for
one
of
the
most
accomplished
pleasures
but
yet
all
this
doth
not
help
the
young
woman
perhaps
all
these
remedies
may
be
good
saith
the
but
they
are
not
for
our
turns
for
alas
a
day
the
very
smell
of
salve
makes
her
fall
into
a
swoon
neither
can
she
suffer
the
least
motion
of
sucking
for
the
very
pain
bereaves
her
of
her
sences
what
shall
we
do
then
to
keep
a
is
both
very
damageable
and
cruel
chargeable
for
are
generally
very
lazy
and
liquorish
and
they
are
ever
chatting
and
chawing
something
or
other
with
the
maids
and
in
their
manner
they
baptize
it
with
saying
it
is
very
necessary
wholesom
for
the
child
and
then
again
to
put
the
child
out
to
nurse
hath
also
several
considerations
first
it
estrangeth
much
from
you
and
who
knows
how
ill
they
may
keep
it
therefore
it
is
best
to
keep
it
at
home
and
indeavour
the
bringing
of
it
up
with
the
spoon
feeding
it
often
with
some
pure
and
cordial
diets
fit
for
the
appetite
and
now
and
then
giving
it
the
sucking
bottle
but
what
remedy
now
this
is
all
to
no
purpose
for
though
the
grandmother
nurse
and
ant
do
what
they
can
yet
all
their
lost
and
the
child
is
so
froward
and
peevish
that
the
nurse
is
ready
to
run
away
from
it
nay
though
she
dandle
and
play
with
it
alwaies
till
past
midnight
it
is
but
washing
the
in
so
much
that
a
must
be
sought
for
or
away
goes
the
child
to
for
this
again
is
required
good
advice
and
the
chusing
of
a
good
one
hath
its
consideration
but
the
tender
heartedness
and
kind
love
that
the
mother
hath
for
her
child
can
no
way
suffer
this
she
will
rather
suck
it
her
self
though
the
pain
be
never
so
great
yet
having
tried
it
again
a
second
time
the
pain
is
so
vehement
that
it
is
impossible
to
withstand
it
therefore
the
new
father
can
not
be
at
quiet
till
there
be
a
found
and
brought
to
them
for
it
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
both
father
and
mother
to
put
the
child
out
to
nurse
and
do
but
see
after
much
seeking
and
diligent
inquiring
the
new
made
grandmother
hath
at
last
found
one
who
is
a
very
neat
cleanly
and
mighty
modest
woman
her
husband
went
a
little
while
ago
to
the
her
child
died
lately
this
is
no
small
joy
but
an
extraordinary
pleasure
both
for
the
new
father
and
woman
oh
now
their
hearts
are
at
rest
and
now
all
things
will
go
well
for
as
the
takes
care
of
the
child
the
dry
nurse
doth
of
the
mother
all
this
pleases
the
good
father
very
well
now
your
time
is
come
to
make
much
of
your
self
that
you
may
recover
strength
now
you
wont
be
troubled
with
the
pains
of
sucking
or
disturbed
of
your
natural
rest
now
you
must
let
the
take
care
for
every
thing
and
look
after
or
meddle
with
nothing
your
self
now
you
must
sleep
quietly
eat
heartily
and
groan
lustily
and
though
you
be
very
well
and
hearty
yet
you
must
seem
to
be
weak
and
quamish
stomackt
for
first
or
last
the
month
of
must
be
kept
full
out
do
but
think
now
by
your
self
what
you
have
a
mind
either
to
eat
or
drink
the
first
and
worst
daies
are
with
the
tossing
and
turmoiling
passed
by
neither
can
you
recover
any
strength
with
eating
of
rosted
apples
and
new
laid
egs
you
are
not
only
weary
of
them
but
it
is
too
weak
a
diet
for
you
the
nine
daies
are
almost
past
and
now
you
must
have
a
more
strengthening
diet
to
wit
a
dish
of
fine
white
pearch
a
roasted
pullet
half
a
dozen
of
young
pigeons
some
wigeons
or
teal
some
sweetbreads
a
piece
of
roast
veal
and
a
delicate
young
turky
and
whilest
you
are
eating
you
must
be
sure
to
drink
two
or
three
glasses
of
the
best
rhenish
wine
very
well
sweetned
with
the
finest
loaf
sugar
you
must
also
be
very
carefull
of
drinking
any
french
wine
for
that
will
too
much
inflame
you
o
new
father
what
a
pleasure
must
all
these
things
be
for
you
and
especially
because
now
you
begin
at
the
to
eat
and
drink
again
with
your
wife
and
you
begin
also
to
perceive
that
if
all
things
advance
as
they
hitherto
have
done
you
may
then
again
in
few
daies
make
fresh
assaults
of
hugging
and
embracing
her
this
is
that
jolly
month
or
six
weeks
that
all
women
talk
so
pleasantly
of
because
it
learns
them
alwaies
such
a
curious
remembrance
and
really
it
is
almost
impossible
that
the
husband
at
these
rates
can
grow
lean
with
it
because
he
as
well
as
his
wife
sits
to
be
cram
up
too
and
he
can
now
with
his
dearest
daily
contrive
and
practice
what
the
nurse
shall
make
ready
that
his
wife
may
eat
with
a
better
appetite
and
recover
new
strength
again
i
would
therefore
advise
the
carefull
nurse
as
a
friend
that
she
should
be
sure
to
provide
her
self
with
the
that
she
might
be
the
more
ready
to
help
the
woman
to
think
upon
what
she
hath
a
mind
to
have
made
ready
for
her
brains
are
but
very
weak
yet
so
that
she
can
not
so
quickly
and
easily
remember
at
first
what
is
pleasantest
and
wholesomest
to
be
eaten
o
thrice
happy
new
father
that
have
gotten
such
a
prudent
diligent
and
carefull
nurse
for
your
wife
what
great
pleasure
is
this
and
behold
by
this
delicate
eating
and
drinking
your
dearest
begins
from
day
to
day
to
grow
stronger
and
stronger
insomuch
that
she
begins
to
throw
the
pillow
at
you
to
spur
you
up
to
be
desirous
of
coming
to
bed
to
her
yea
she
promiseth
you
that
before
she
is
out
of
she
will
make
you
possessor
of
another
principal
and
main
pleasure
illustration
folio
by
the
navarre
society
the
ninth
pleasure
the
gossips
now
o
new
father
you
have
had
the
possession
of
eight
pleasures
which
undoubtedly
have
tickled
you
to
some
purpose
but
now
there
is
a
new
one
approaching
that
will
be
as
full
of
so
many
joyfull
delights
and
wishings
of
prosperity
as
ever
the
first
and
most
famous
hath
been
for
it
seems
as
if
your
wife
begins
to
be
a
weary
of
this
lazy
liquorish
life
and
to
leave
off
her
grunting
and
groaning
because
she
now
longs
to
be
gadding
up
and
down
the
street
or
standing
at
the
dore
with
her
babe
in
her
arms
but
before
this
can
be
done
you
know
that
there
ought
to
be
a
gossips
feast
kept
to
this
end
the
nurse
must
be
sent
abroad
and
a
serious
counsel
held
as
if
the
parliament
of
women
were
assembled
to
consult
who
shall
be
invited
and
who
not
wounds
what
a
list
of
relations
and
strange
acquaintance
are
here
sum
up
in
a
company
together
to
be
invited
to
the
gossipping
feast
is
impossible
the
nurse
can
ever
do
this
all
in
one
day
because
she
would
not
willingly
miss
any
of
them
out
of
the
earnest
hopes
she
hath
of
the
presents
she
expects
and
then
also
she
must
give
an
account
to
every
one
of
them
that
are
invited
of
the
state
and
condition
of
the
woman
and
her
child
i
wonder
that
there
is
no
body
that
sollicites
to
have
the
office
of
an
inviter
to
all
such
sort
of
gossippings
but
the
women
understand
these
affairs
and
the
ordering
of
such
sort
of
invitations
much
better
than
any
one
else
therefore
is
not
necessary
o
new
father
what
a
sweet
delight
and
pleasure
you
must
needs
have
in
reviewing
this
great
list
of
your
gossips
what
multiplicities
of
wishes
of
joy
and
prosperity
have
you
to
expect
but
if
i
were
to
be
your
counsellor
i
assure
you
i
would
order
the
nurse
to
desire
doctor
my
lord
and
then
the
other
gentlemen
to
wit
masters
dryliver
spillnot
and
to
fetch
home
their
wives
in
good
time
from
the
gossipping
because
you
have
other
mens
wives
who
are
your
near
relations
that
you
must
entertain
longer
and
they
otherwise
will
never
think
of
rising
or
going
home
though
it
were
midnight
and
by
this
means
you
will
have
a
fit
opportunity
with
a
full
bowl
and
a
pipe
to
wash
away
that
rammish
sent
of
a
out
of
your
brains
and
also
after
many
hopes
once
arrive
to
the
height
of
receiving
your
full
delight
and
pleasure
and
then
you
may
clap
it
all
together
upon
the
account
of
a
now
nurse
here
you
have
work
by
whole
for
you
shall
no
sooner
have
made
an
end
of
your
other
errands
but
immediately
so
much
tricking
and
pricking
of
all
things
up
in
neat
order
against
the
coming
of
the
guests
that
it
a
terror
to
think
o
their
eys
will
fly
into
every
nook
and
corner
nay
the
very
house
of
office
must
be
extraordinary
neat
and
clean
for
mistris
gossip
and
goody
will
be
peeping
into
every
crevise
and
cranny
and
because
they
will
do
it
forsooth
according
to
their
fashion
they
make
a
shew
as
if
they
must
go
to
the
necessary
chamber
with
a
letter
to
only
to
take
an
inspection
whether
it
be
as
cleanly
there
as
it
is
upon
the
gossipping
chamber
where
all
the
guests
are
and
is
a
wonder
if
they
do
not
look
into
the
seat
to
see
whether
there
be
no
spyders
webs
spun
in
it
or
whether
the
goldfinders
merchandize
be
of
a
good
colour
and
thickness
but
come
let
pass
all
this
by
for
in
the
middle
of
these
incumbrances
the
time
will
not
only
fly
away
but
we
shall
at
the
hour
appointed
be
surprized
by
our
guests
uds
life
how
busie
the
wet
and
are
with
dressing
the
babe
neatly
now
father
look
once
upon
your
child
o
pretty
thing
o
dainty
darling
is
father
own
picture
well
what
would
not
one
undergo
to
be
the
mother
of
so
fine
an
angel
and
who
can
or
dare
doubt
any
thing
of
it
for
the
mother
loves
it
and
the
father
beleeves
it
nay
and
all
the
friends
that
come
tumbling
in
one
upon
another
do
confirm
it
for
behold
every
one
looks
earnestly
at
the
babe
and
doth
not
a
little
commend
his
prettiness
one
saith
it
is
as
like
the
father
alias
daddy
as
one
drop
of
water
is
like
another
another
that
the
upper
part
of
the
face
forehead
eys
and
nose
incline
very
much
to
be
like
the
mother
but
downwards
it
is
every
bit
the
father
and
who
forsooth
should
not
beleeve
it
if
it
be
a
son
every
one
is
in
an
admiration
o
me
what
a
pretty
sweet
infant
nurse
you
have
drest
it
up
most
curiously
and
truly
there
no
cost
spar
for
the
having
very
rich
laces
thus
they
ly
and
tamper
upon
this
first
string
till
the
woman
begins
to
enter
upon
the
relating
what
great
pain
in
travell
she
had
to
fetch
this
child
out
of
the
what
a
difference
there
was
between
her
and
others
of
her
acquaintance
thereout
every
one
hath
so
much
matter
as
would
make
a
sermon
and
the
conclusion
generally
is
the
relating
how
and
when
the
good
man
crept
to
bed
to
her
again
and
how
such
a
one
had
been
a
fortnight
with
child
before
she
went
to
receive
her
churching
where
upon
another
comes
with
a
confession
that
her
husband
was
not
half
so
hot
do
but
tarry
a
little
yet
till
the
hath
gone
once
or
twice
more
about
with
old
hock
then
hear
these
parrots
tell
you
other
sorts
of
tales
in
the
mean
while
do
but
see
the
husband
poor
how
he
rejoyces
that
his
wife
is
so
reasonable
strong
again
and
that
she
is
so
neatly
trickt
up
sitting
in
state
in
the
best
furnished
room
by
the
o
what
a
pleasure
this
is
o
how
he
treats
all
the
women
with
delicate
marget
ale
and
sack
and
sugar
unless
he
begin
to
bethink
himself
and
for
respects
sake
or
frugality
sets
some
bottles
aside
because
he
perceives
it
to
be
nothing
else
but
a
vast
expence
and
womens
apish
tricks
how
busie
he
is
in
carving
for
them
of
his
capons
or
some
other
savoury
bit
to
make
their
mouths
relish
their
liquor
the
better
and
then
stand
fast
bowls
and
glasses
for
they
resolve
not
to
flinch
from
it
and
indeed
why
should
he
not
for
he
is
now
a
whole
estate
richer
then
he
was
before
and
what
need
he
care
for
it
then
well
behold
here
now
the
womens
mouths
are
a
beginning
to
be
first
a
little
warm
and
none
of
them
all
can
be
silent
though
they
should
speak
of
their
own
commodities
o
how
happy
would
you
be
o
goodman
if
you
had
but
as
many
ears
as
had
eys
that
you
might
hear
every
where
whilest
you
are
carving
and
serving
of
them
what
pretty
sweet
stories
and
discourses
these
sorts
of
parrats
will
be
talking
of
for
mistris
relates
what
a
pleasure
she
oft
times
received
in
it
to
keep
with
her
husband
at
noons
as
soon
as
they
had
feasted
their
carkasses
well
but
that
conning
of
her
lesson
had
caused
her
severall
times
to
make
a
journy
to
the
at
this
mistris
wonders
extreamly
saying
how
strangely
these
things
happen
to
one
woman
more
then
another
in
our
parish
there
is
a
married
woman
brought
to
bed
but
she
was
so
miserably
handled
by
the
midwife
that
no
tongue
can
express
it
insomuch
that
master
the
man
midwife
was
fain
to
be
fetcht
to
assist
with
his
instrument
it
was
a
very
great
wonder
that
the
woman
ever
escaped
it
which
is
most
lamentable
indeed
to
be
related
and
too
sad
indeed
to
be
placed
by
me
among
the
pleasures
of
marriage
in
the
mean
time
at
the
end
of
the
chamber
mistris
relates
a
pretty
story
how
their
maid
was
very
curiously
stitcht
up
by
their
tailor
and
how
she
was
every
foot
running
thither
then
to
have
a
hole
finely
drawn
that
she
had
torn
in
her
another
while
to
have
her
bodice
made
a
little
wider
and
then
again
to
have
her
stockins
soled
it
is
no
wonder
saith
mistres
that
this
should
happen
to
a
poor
innocent
servant
maid
there
was
my
husbands
first
wives
niece
rs
that
modest
virgin
she
kept
such
a
close
conversation
daily
communication
with
master
that
at
last
there
appeared
a
little
with
little
ears
and
short
hair
nay
then
saith
mistris
those
two
sisters
need
not
twit
one
another
in
the
teeth
with
it
for
the
kept
such
a
sweet
compliance
and
converse
with
the
spanish
fruiterer
yonder
at
the
where
she
did
eat
so
many
china
oranges
and
other
watrish
fruits
that
they
caused
her
to
get
an
extraordinary
swelling
under
her
stomack
which
doctor
judged
to
proceed
from
some
obstructions
wind
and
other
watrish
humours
but
it
did
not
continue
so
long
before
her
mother
beginning
better
to
apprehend
the
nature
of
her
distemper
sent
her
away
to
her
at
hackney
mistris
was
going
to
begin
again
but
they
heard
such
rapping
and
knocking
at
the
dore
that
one
of
them
said
i
beleeve
there
are
our
husbands
and
indeed
she
guest
very
well
this
augmented
their
mirth
mightily
and
especially
of
the
nurse
for
now
she
was
sure
that
if
the
good
cully
her
master
treated
his
gossips
nobly
and
liberally
her
presents
would
be
doubled
but
nurse
do
not
cheat
your
self
for
fear
it
might
happen
otherwise
i
know
once
a
merry
boon
companion
who
being
at
a
gossipping
feast
called
the
nurse
alone
to
him
and
saies
to
her
nurse
swear
you
are
very
vigilant
and
take
a
great
deal
of
pains
in
serving
both
us
and
our
wives
with
all
things
and
also
filling
of
us
full
glasses
and
bowls
hark
hither
my
wife
is
a
little
covetous
and
so
that
she
doth
not
keep
her
credit
where
she
ought
to
do
so
that
i
beleeve
her
gift
will
not
be
very
great
and
truly
because
you
are
such
a
good
body
see
there
that
for
you
put
it
some
where
privately
away
thrusts
her
an
indifferent
great
brass
counter
wrapt
up
in
a
paper
into
her
hand
the
nurse
certainly
beleeving
this
to
be
at
the
least
a
crown
piece
thanks
him
very
demurely
and
puts
it
in
her
pocket
never
opening
it
till
they
were
every
one
of
them
gone
but
then
she
saw
that
she
was
basely
cheated
but
nurse
you
are
warned
now
by
this
another
time
you
may
look
better
yet
methinks
i
fill
about
lustily
it
is
the
good
man
of
the
house
his
wine
and
when
the
wine
begins
to
surge
the
men
are
much
more
generous
than
before
and
verily
methinks
i
have
a
mind
to
take
my
portion
of
it
also
but
yet
not
so
as
the
nurse
did
at
my
neeces
who
had
toss
up
her
bowls
so
bravely
upon
the
good
health
of
the
woman
her
mistriss
that
when
she
was
going
to
swathe
and
feed
the
child
instead
of
putting
the
spoon
into
the
mouth
she
thrust
it
under
the
chin
sometimes
against
the
breast
and
then
when
she
was
about
swathing
of
it
as
it
is
commonly
the
custom
to
lay
a
wollen
blanket
and
linnen
bed
together
she
wrapt
the
poor
infant
with
its
little
naked
body
only
in
the
blanket
alone
o
thrice
happy
young
father
who
have
hitherto
so
nobly
treated
and
entertained
all
your
she
gossips
and
had
the
audience
of
all
their
curious
relations
now
you
will
have
the
honour
also
of
entertaining
their
husbands
your
who
will
not
be
backward
in
doing
of
you
reason
out
of
the
greatest
bowl
you
will
set
before
them
and
talk
as
freely
of
a
merchandize
who
is
there
now
that
doth
not
praise
and
commend
your
manfull
deeds
to
the
highest
ha
ha
saith
master
that
a
child
who
ever
saw
a
braver
there
not
the
fellow
o
o
my
dearest
i
have
such
a
delight
in
this
child
that
if
we
were
but
a
little
alone
together
i
cast
you
such
another
as
if
it
were
of
the
same
mould
stay
a
little
stay
a
little
saith
it
may
be
you
would
not
run
so
strong
a
course
yet
i
saw
once
two
souldiers
who
were
batchelors
that
were
sitting
in
an
evening
drinking
in
an
alehouse
and
talking
lustily
of
the
bobbinjo
trade
whereupon
one
of
them
said
cocksbobs
if
i
had
but
a
wife
as
well
as
another
i
presently
get
her
with
child
of
a
brave
boy
ho
ho
saith
the
it
is
an
easie
thing
to
get
a
wife
if
one
seek
it
if
i
would
i
dare
lay
a
wager
o
i
would
be
the
bridegroom
within
the
space
of
two
hours
the
other
not
beleeving
him
they
laid
a
wager
between
them
for
a
bottle
of
wine
hereupon
one
of
them
went
out
of
dores
just
upon
the
striking
of
the
clock
hardly
was
gone
a
streets
length
before
he
met
with
a
bonny
bouncing
girl
who
was
going
of
an
errand
for
her
mistris
and
he
presently
laies
her
on
board
but
she
seemed
to
be
very
much
offended
that
an
honest
maid
going
about
her
business
in
the
evening
should
be
in
this
manner
so
encountred
by
a
strange
fellow
with
a
sword
by
his
side
verily
sweetheart
said
he
you
have
a
great
deal
of
reason
in
all
what
you
say
but
you
may
certainly
beleeve
that
it
is
an
honest
person
who
speaks
to
you
and
only
seeks
an
occasion
to
be
acquainted
with
a
virtuous
good
condition
maid
my
wearing
of
a
sword
is
because
i
am
a
souldier
and
am
very
well
known
by
many
honest
people
and
truly
if
you
please
to
admit
me
this
favour
you
shall
see
and
find
me
to
be
an
honest
man
and
none
of
those
that
go
about
to
ly
and
deceive
any
body
and
indeed
my
intention
desire
is
to
marry
to
that
end
seeking
nothing
but
an
honest
maid
and
i
doubt
not
but
that
i
have
at
this
time
found
one
to
my
mind
and
went
forward
with
his
chat
in
these
sort
of
terms
but
the
maid
denied
him
saying
that
she
had
no
mind
to
a
souldier
because
it
was
one
of
the
poorest
and
miserablest
sort
of
levelihoods
their
pay
being
but
very
little
and
they
were
seldom
advanced
he
on
the
other
side
commending
approving
a
souldiers
life
to
be
the
merriest
resolutest
absolute
easiest
of
any
that
was
under
the
sun
because
that
neither
hungrie
care
nor
finical
pride
did
any
waies
take
place
by
them
but
that
they
on
the
contrary
were
alwaies
merry
never
admitting
sorrow
into
their
thoughts
is
true
said
he
our
pay
is
but
small
but
then
again
all
what
the
country
people
have
is
our
own
for
what
we
want
our
selves
we
get
from
them
we
never
take
care
for
to
morrow
having
alwaies
something
fresh
every
day
new
mirth
riches
sweetheart
doth
not
consist
in
multiplicity
of
goods
but
in
content
no
one
better
satisfied
than
a
souldier
therefore
you
shall
alwaies
see
an
honest
souldier
look
plump
and
fat
just
as
i
do
but
drunkards
and
fall
away
miserably
in
short
the
maid
begun
a
little
to
listen
to
him
and
so
much
the
more
because
that
very
morning
she
had
a
falling
out
with
her
mistris
and
told
him
she
would
take
it
into
consideration
he
answered
her
again
what
a
fidle
stick
why
should
we
spend
time
in
thinking
we
are
equally
matcht
a
souldier
never
thinks
long
upon
any
thing
but
takes
hold
of
all
present
opportunities
and
it
generally
falls
out
well
with
him
but
she
drawing
back
a
little
he
saith
ah
my
dearest
you
must
take
a
quick
resolution
behold
there
yonder
comes
a
cloud
driving
towards
the
moon
give
you
so
much
time
till
that
be
past
by
therefore
be
pleased
to
resolve
quick
for
otherwise
i
must
go
seek
my
fortune
by
another
for
a
soldier
neither
woos
nor
threatens
long
upon
this
she
considered
a
little
but
before
the
cloud
was
past
by
the
moon
she
gave
him
her
consent
and
he
gave
her
his
for
a
pledge
of
marriage
and
desired
something
of
her
in
like
manner
for
a
pledge
but
she
said
she
had
nothing
howsoever
he
persisted
so
strongly
that
in
conclusion
she
gave
him
her
garter
for
a
pledge
of
marriage
he
was
contented
with
it
and
taking
his
leave
went
unto
his
comrades
and
told
them
what
had
hapned
to
him
shewing
them
the
garter
whereupon
he
that
had
laid
the
wager
with
him
askt
who
it
was
what
her
name
was
and
where
she
dwelt
and
being
told
by
another
that
it
was
a
handsom
neat
and
very
well
complexion
maid
by
my
troth
said
he
i
wish
i
were
to
give
four
cans
of
wine
that
i
could
light
upon
such
another
well
see
there
saith
the
first
if
you
will
give
four
cans
of
wine
i
will
both
give
you
the
garter
the
maid
too
into
the
bargain
it
was
done
but
by
moonlight
so
that
hardly
know
whether
it
be
me
or
another
hereupon
the
agreement
was
concluded
the
two
first
cans
of
wine
were
spent
and
the
garter
was
delivered
to
him
and
every
one
charged
to
keep
it
secret
this
second
souldier
goes
to
the
maid
next
day
in
the
evening
at
the
hour
and
place
where
they
had
appointed
to
meet
and
there
relating
to
her
several
passages
that
were
passed
between
them
the
day
before
and
shewing
her
the
garter
made
her
beleeve
that
he
was
the
person
that
had
contracted
with
her
the
day
before
to
be
short
the
maid
leaves
her
service
and
marries
him
and
that
which
is
most
to
be
observed
is
that
that
which
the
first
souldier
vaunted
to
have
done
the
second
performed
for
just
nine
months
after
they
were
married
she
was
brought
to
bed
of
a
gallant
young
boy
and
they
lived
very
peaceably
and
quietly
together
well
vow
saith
master
that
a
very
notable
relation
it
is
better
a
great
deal
that
the
business
happen
so
then
like
another
which
is
just
contrary
that
i
shall
make
mention
of
to
you
and
who
by
a
sudden
accident
without
much
wooing
were
gotten
together
and
their
first
bane
of
matrimony
was
published
but
falling
out
they
called
one
another
all
the
names
that
they
could
reap
together
nay
it
run
so
high
that
they
would
discharge
each
other
of
their
promises
and
resolved
to
go
to
the
bishop
crave
that
they
might
have
liberty
to
forbid
the
banes
themselves
which
hapned
so
coming
then
with
before
his
grace
complained
that
he
did
already
perceive
his
intended
marriage
would
never
come
to
a
good
event
because
he
found
perfectly
that
this
maid
was
a
lumpish
jade
a
nasty
slut
a
scolding
bawling
carrion
a
restless
peece
of
mortality
therefore
it
might
go
as
it
would
he
did
not
care
for
the
maid
neither
would
he
marry
her
and
for
those
reasons
he
desired
his
grace
to
grant
that
the
banes
might
be
forbidden
as
thinking
it
much
better
for
him
to
quit
her
betimes
before
it
was
too
late
she
on
the
side
said
that
he
was
one
that
run
gadding
along
the
streets
at
all
hours
of
the
night
a
private
drunken
beast
a
so
that
she
did
not
care
for
him
neither
whereupon
his
grace
smiling
told
them
well
you
fellow
and
wench
do
you
think
that
we
do
here
so
give
and
take
away
the
consent
of
marriage
perhaps
when
you
are
married
it
may
be
much
better
for
the
marriage
bed
doth
for
the
most
part
change
the
ten
sences
into
five
but
she
answered
may
it
please
your
grace
he
is
no
such
man
to
do
that
for
all
that
he
can
do
is
only
his
own
and
nothing
else
whereupon
he
again
answered
may
it
please
your
grace
i
have
no
mind
ever
to
try
it
with
such
a
creature
as
she
is
i
should
be
then
fast
enough
bound
to
her
neither
would
i
willingly
go
alive
headlong
to
the
devil
to
take
my
habitation
in
hell
the
bishop
thus
perceiving
that
no
good
thread
could
be
spun
of
such
sort
of
flax
caused
the
banes
to
be
forbidden
then
said
may
it
please
your
grace
am
i
not
a
freeman
may
i
not
marry
with
whom
i
please
or
have
a
mind
to
to
which
his
grace
answered
yes
presently
thrusting
his
head
out
at
the
dore
calls
out
aloud
do
you
come
hither
now
and
begged
that
his
grace
would
be
pleased
to
give
him
leave
to
marry
with
this
person
which
mall
seeing
she
cries
out
you
rogue
you
have
been
too
cunning
for
me
in
this
if
i
had
the
least
thoughts
o
i
would
have
had
my
to
have
tarried
for
me
at
this
dore
instead
of
tarrying
for
me
at
another
place
whereupon
his
grace
being
in
great
ire
chid
them
most
shrewdly
giving
them
such
strong
reproofs
that
at
first
it
might
very
well
be
imagined
that
he
would
never
have
admitted
of
a
second
consent
yet
afterwards
upon
considerations
it
was
granted
but
being
now
married
with
they
got
no
children
and
being
married
to
they
had
both
a
son
and
a
daughter
at
one
birth
by
which
its
easie
to
be
observed
what
acquaintance
had
made
with
before
hand
why
she
would
rather
marry
with
hall
then
with
him
to
this
again
mistris
relates
that
she
had
been
several
times
invited
to
mistris
labour
and
that
she
had
been
twice
brought
to
bed
very
happily
of
two
delicate
twins
and
in
the
last
encounter
for
a
recompence
of
the
affection
of
her
beloved
she
presented
him
with
two
lustly
and
gallant
boys
but
because
she
would
equally
balance
his
great
bounty
the
midwife
takes
the
same
walk
again
for
another
and
finding
in
what
condition
things
stood
she
calls
for
a
bason
of
warm
water
bringing
out
at
last
a
most
delicate
pretty
daughter
that
was
yet
poor
thing
wrapt
up
in
the
cawl
which
she
immediately
laid
into
the
warm
water
and
shewed
unto
them
all
the
wonderfull
works
of
nature
for
there
they
could
see
it
move
and
stir
as
if
it
had
been
in
its
mothers
glass
bottle
but
the
skin
being
just
cut
open
with
a
small
hole
it
begun
presently
to
make
a
little
noise
like
a
weak
childish
voice
which
indeed
was
very
rare
pleasant
to
be
seen
in
truth
such
a
father
who
can
cast
every
time
such
high
doubblets
may
very
well
be
called
by
the
name
of
brave
but
this
story
was
hardly
told
before
mistris
pursued
it
with
another
out
of
the
same
text
saying
a
little
more
then
two
years
ago
i
was
at
a
gossipping
by
mistris
who
was
then
brought
to
bed
both
of
a
son
and
a
daughter
also
at
one
birth
but
indeed
the
labour
came
so
violently
upon
her
that
as
she
was
standing
upon
the
stairs
not
being
able
to
set
one
foot
further
and
having
neither
midwife
nor
any
other
women
of
her
neighbors
and
friends
only
the
assistance
of
her
husband
and
the
maid
she
was
immediately
delivered
of
two
gallant
children
but
they
did
not
live
long
upon
my
word
said
mistris
it
is
an
excellent
help
when
men
understand
their
travelling
upon
such
sort
of
roads
it
hapned
to
me
once
that
some
gentlewomen
were
merry
with
me
somewhat
late
in
the
evening
and
because
i
had
had
several
symptoms
of
labour
said
this
mistris
if
you
would
now
take
a
walk
to
the
parsley
bed
we
would
help
you
very
bravely
but
neither
wind
nor
weather
was
serviceable
at
that
time
but
they
had
hardly
been
gone
an
hour
and
being
in
bed
with
my
husband
and
he
very
fast
asleep
before
there
begun
such
an
alteration
of
the
weather
that
my
husband
must
up
with
all
speed
who
wakened
the
maid
and
sent
her
for
the
midwife
laying
on
fire
himself
in
all
hast
yet
do
all
what
they
could
within
less
then
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
that
without
any
bodies
help
but
my
husbands
my
journy
was
performed
but
things
were
done
with
such
a
confusion
that
he
received
the
child
in
the
christning
cloath
instead
of
the
blanket
and
a
thousand
more
such
stories
as
these
are
ript
up
that
would
burthen
the
strongest
memory
to
bear
them
and
so
much
the
more
because
it
is
impossible
to
distinguish
one
from
the
when
the
men
and
the
women
that
gabble
so
one
among
another
and
they
spin
such
course
threads
of
bawdery
in
their
talk
that
are
enough
to
spoil
a
whole
web
of
linnen
and
who
can
tell
but
that
their
tattling
would
last
a
whole
night
for
there
hardly
one
of
them
who
hath
not
at
the
least
a
hundred
in
their
budgets
but
because
it
is
high
time
that
either
the
dry
or
must
go
to
swathe
the
child
they
begin
to
break
off
and
shorten
their
now
young
father
do
but
observe
what
fine
airy
complements
will
be
presented
to
you
at
their
parting
every
one
thanks
you
for
your
kind
and
cordial
entertainment
and
not
one
of
them
forgets
to
wish
that
you
may
the
next
year
either
have
a
daughter
to
your
son
or
a
son
to
your
daughter
imagining
then
that
all
things
is
well
when
you
receive
such
a
full
crop
but
i
am
most
apt
to
beleeve
that
all
their
wishes
aim
at
the
but
of
coming
next
year
again
to
the
gossips
feast
to
toss
up
the
and
in
telling
of
a
bobbinjo
story
they
peep
into
all
nooks
and
corners
well
o
new
father
this
pleasure
begins
to
come
to
a
conclusion
but
prithee
tell
me
would
not
a
body
wish
for
the
getting
of
such
another
that
his
wife
might
make
a
journy
to
the
twice
a
year
now
nurse
have
at
you
you
shall
now
reap
the
fruit
of
all
your
running
and
going
early
late
to
invite
them
oh
thinks
she
by
her
self
would
but
every
shilling
change
it
self
into
a
but
nurse
hardly
be
troubled
with
a
fit
of
that
yellow
jaundies
sickness
for
there
no
drug
at
the
apothecaries
nor
any
lice
among
the
beggars
that
can
cure
you
of
it
and
i
dare
say
nurse
that
go
nigh
to
perceive
that
its
a
very
hard
time
and
mony
mighty
scarce
because
formerly
the
women
used
to
put
their
hands
more
liberally
in
their
purses
and
one
gave
a
crown
another
half
a
crown
but
the
times
are
now
so
strangely
altered
that
they
keep
little
only
for
that
use
nay
some
of
them
rub
it
off
with
a
couple
of
their
grandams
gray
groats
but
howsoever
i
hope
for
your
sake
it
will
not
be
here
according
as
often
happens
fair
promises
but
no
performances
for
if
it
should
i
protest
ye
ought
to
have
made
your
bargain
to
have
had
a
peece
more
at
the
least
for
your
nurse
keeping
or
otherwise
you
must
have
had
the
full
liberty
to
toss
up
the
remains
of
all
that
was
left
in
the
gossipping
bowls
or
else
to
have
carried
the
key
of
the
wine
cellar
alwaies
in
your
pocket
and
then
after
the
feeding
and
swathing
the
child
you
might
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
swinge
up
a
lustly
glass
upon
the
good
health
of
the
father
mother
and
the
child
for
the
wine
was
laid
in
to
be
made
use
of
to
that
end
and
purpose
and
it
is
commonly
known
that
the
nurses
are
not
so
mealy
mouth
for
although
they
do
do
it
that
every
one
should
see
it
be
sure
with
the
maid
to
get
their
shares
in
one
corner
or
other
but
you
must
for
this
again
think
that
the
freer
you
let
them
take
their
swing
herein
the
more
care
they
will
take
for
the
child
now
nurse
do
spare
to
make
good
use
of
your
time
for
it
belongs
amongst
other
things
to
this
pleasure
and
the
new
father
will
nevertheless
be
turning
about
to
another
mirth
and
then
you
may
be
sure
to
expect
to
have
a
god
be
therefore
make
much
of
your
self
and
toss
up
your
glasses
stoutly
at
the
who
knows
whether
you
may
have
the
opportunity
this
twelve
month
again
to
meet
with
such
a
good
a
liquorish
woman
a
plentifull
housekeeping
is
not
every
where
and
you
may
certainly
beleeve
that
the
month
will
be
no
sooner
ended
then
that
begin
to
stink
here
for
the
mistris
will
begin
to
consider
with
her
self
that
she
can
make
a
shift
with
the
maid
and
so
that
then
you
must
expect
to
get
your
undesired
pass
then
you
must
return
back
again
to
your
own
lodging
that
dark
moist
and
mournfull
cell
and
satisfie
your
self
if
you
can
get
it
with
a
mess
of
milk
and
brown
george
or
some
such
sort
of
lean
fare
so
that
have
time
enough
to
wast
away
that
fulsomness
and
fogginess
of
body
that
you
have
gotten
in
your
for
there
no
body
that
will
give
you
any
thing
or
thinks
in
the
least
upon
your
attendance
unless
they
want
you
again
o
new
father
pray
for
it
to
come
again
within
a
twelve
month
that
you
may
have
a
renewing
of
this
pleasure
once
more
for
it
is
with
the
its
leave
and
will
conduct
you
to
a
following
the
tenth
pleasure
great
feast
is
kept
and
the
child
put
in
oh
how
pleasant
is
of
married
people
above
that
of
batchelors
and
maids
how
it
distributes
mirths
and
pleasures
verily
one
may
in
some
measure
recogitate
or
write
something
of
it
but
it
is
impossible
to
imprint
so
a
splendor
in
potters
clay
or
to
display
it
with
the
most
curious
colours
though
the
accomplishedst
painter
might
have
drawn
it
very
near
the
life
yet
it
would
be
but
a
dead
draught
in
comparison
of
the
reality
and
experience
that
is
found
in
it
self
you
have
already
seen
here
nine
parts
or
tables
but
it
is
not
ninety
pictures
that
can
sufficiently
shew
you
the
fulness
of
one
of
the
nine
parts
be
therefore
chearfully
merry
o
sweet
couple
because
you
are
in
so
short
a
time
arisen
to
the
height
of
being
possessors
of
all
these
pleasures
and
so
much
the
more
the
ninth
being
hardly
past
before
the
tenth
follows
as
it
were
treading
upon
the
heels
of
the
illustration
folio
by
the
navarre
society
they
have
scarce
wiped
their
mouths
or
digested
the
wine
in
their
stomacks
before
there
starts
up
a
new
day
of
mirth
jollity
for
now
there
must
be
a
feast
kept
the
child
must
be
put
in
cloaths
o
what
two
vast
pleasures
are
these
for
the
young
father
is
indeed
too
much
joy
for
one
person
alone
to
be
possessor
of
at
first
you
had
the
pleasure
for
to
treat
the
women
those
pretty
pleasing
creatures
and
to
hear
all
their
sweet
and
amiable
discourses
but
now
you
shall
be
honoured
with
treating
the
matron
like
midwife
and
those
men
and
women
that
are
your
kindest
friends
and
nearest
relations
yea
and
the
and
also
who
will
all
of
them
accompany
you
with
courteous
discourses
and
pleasant
countenances
they
will
begin
a
lusty
bowl
or
thumping
glass
drink
it
out
upon
the
health
prosperity
of
you
your
bedfellow
and
young
son
and
very
heartily
wish
that
you
may
increase
and
multiply
at
least
every
year
with
one
new
babe
because
that
they
then
might
the
better
come
to
the
feast
here
see
now
how
smartly
both
lick
your
dishes
and
toss
your
cups
and
glasses
off
begin
you
only
some
good
healths
as
pray
god
bless
his
majesty
and
all
the
royal
family
the
prosperity
of
our
native
country
all
the
well
wishers
of
the
cities
welfare
and
when
you
have
done
begin
and
about
it
goes
to
invest
you
with
the
honour
and
name
in
a
full
bowl
to
the
father
of
the
family
well
is
not
that
a
noble
title
such
a
pleasure
alone
is
worth
a
thousand
pounds
at
lest
and
whilest
the
men
are
busie
this
way
the
good
woman
with
the
other
women
are
contriving
on
the
other
side
how
the
child
ought
to
be
put
in
cloaths
upon
the
best
and
modishest
manner
for
she
is
resolved
to
morrow
morning
to
be
church
in
the
afternoon
go
to
market
she
accomplishes
the
first
well
enough
but
is
at
a
damnable
doubt
in
the
second
part
of
her
resolution
for
by
the
way
in
the
church
and
in
the
streets
she
hath
continually
observed
severall
children
and
the
most
part
of
them
dressed
up
in
severall
sorts
of
fashions
some
of
them
she
hath
a
great
fancy
for
but
then
she
doubts
whether
that
be
the
newest
mode
or
not
one
seems
too
plain
and
common
which
makes
her
imagine
in
her
thoughts
that
too
clownish
but
others
stand
very
neat
and
handsom
is
true
the
stuf
and
the
lining
is
costly
and
very
dear
but
then
again
it
is
very
comly
and
handsom
and
then
again
she
thinks
with
her
self
as
long
as
i
am
at
market
i
as
good
go
through
stirch
with
it
and
make
but
one
paying
for
all
it
is
for
our
first
and
but
for
a
little
child
not
for
a
great
person
therefore
it
is
better
to
take
that
which
is
curious
and
neat
the
price
for
making
is
all
one
besides
it
will
be
a
great
pleasure
for
my
husband
when
he
sees
how
delicately
the
child
is
drest
up
and
his
mony
so
extraordinarily
well
husbanded
now
my
dearest
pray
be
you
merry
if
the
stuf
hath
cost
somthing
much
you
have
need
but
of
little
and
it
is
for
your
first
when
it
grows
bigger
or
that
you
get
more
you
must
part
with
much
more
mony
do
grudge
at
this
for
once
because
then
you
would
spoil
all
your
mirth
and
pleasure
with
it
rejoice
that
you
have
a
wife
who
is
not
only
good
to
fetch
children
out
of
the
parsley
bed
but
is
also
very
carefull
to
see
them
well
nourished
and
neat
and
cleanly
cloath
you
your
self
have
the
praise
and
commendation
of
it
let
her
alone
a
while
for
women
must
have
their
wills
say
but
little
to
her
for
her
brains
are
too
much
busied
already
and
it
may
be
that
in
three
hours
time
you
would
hardly
get
three
words
of
answer
from
her
and
suppose
you
should
relate
somthing
or
other
to
her
this
shall
be
your
answer
from
her
at
last
that
she
did
not
well
understand
you
because
all
her
thoughts
nay
her
very
sences
do
as
it
were
glide
to
again
one
among
another
continually
to
order
the
dressing
up
of
her
child
i
am
very
well
assured
o
new
invested
husband
that
your
wits
at
present
run
a
because
that
both
merchandize
and
trade
are
neither
of
them
so
quick
as
you
would
fain
see
them
and
by
reason
of
this
tedious
and
destructive
war
monies
is
horrible
scarce
nothing
near
so
plentifull
as
you
could
wish
it
to
be
but
comfort
your
self
herewith
that
it
hath
hapned
to
others
will
yet
also
happen
oftner
to
you
yet
this
is
one
of
the
least
things
but
stay
a
little
to
morrow
or
next
day
the
nurse
goes
away
this
seems
to
be
a
merriment
indeed
for
then
have
an
eater
a
a
a
and
less
than
you
had
before
you
are
yet
so
happy
that
you
have
a
that
carefully
looks
after
the
child
by
which
means
both
you
and
your
wife
are
freed
from
tossing
and
tumbling
with
it
in
the
night
whilest
others
on
the
contrary
that
have
no
in
their
houses
begin
first
to
tast
when
the
goes
away
what
a
pleasure
it
is
that
the
child
must
be
set
by
the
bedside
and
the
charge
thereof
left
unto
both
father
mother
when
it
oftentimes
happens
that
the
good
woman
is
yet
so
weak
she
can
neither
lay
the
child
in
nor
take
it
out
of
the
cradle
insomuch
that
the
father
here
must
put
a
helping
hand
because
he
is
of
a
stronger
constitution
and
hath
the
greatest
share
in
it
by
my
faith
such
as
those
are
they
who
have
the
first
and
true
tast
of
the
kernel
of
the
tenth
pleasure
because
the
husband
ought
as
then
out
of
a
tender
affection
for
his
wife
to
rock
continually
that
she
might
take
her
rest
otherwise
she
would
not
get
any
suck
in
her
breasts
for
the
child
and
happy
they
are
somtimes
if
they
come
off
with
but
rocking
the
most
part
of
the
night
for
many
times
it
happens
that
the
child
is
so
restless
and
unquiet
that
father
mother
maid
nay
and
all
whatsoever
is
in
the
house
must
out
of
their
beds
to
quiet
it
and
though
they
use
a
thousand
tricks
and
stratagems
yet
all
to
no
purpose
and
yet
this
is
but
a
small
matter
for
them
neither
for
before
a
few
months
are
past
the
child
begins
to
get
teeth
and
bawls
and
cries
so
night
day
that
they
can
tell
the
clock
all
the
night
long
wishing
a
thousand
thousand
times
over
that
they
might
see
and
so
by
the
comfortable
assistance
of
receive
a
little
solace
for
all
their
toiling
and
tumbling
too
and
again
yet
i
would
advise
such
as
these
that
they
must
in
no
manner
be
discomforted
at
this
if
they
intend
to
demonstrate
that
they
have
learnt
somthing
in
the
school
of
marriage
to
exercise
their
patiences
but
on
the
contrary
to
shew
themselves
contented
with
all
things
being
assured
that
hereafter
when
all
this
trouble
is
past
they
shall
receive
the
happiness
that
the
child
will
return
them
thanks
with
its
pretty
smiles
and
in
time
also
will
salute
them
with
a
slabbering
cocurring
and
i
beleeve
now
that
they
clearly
find
that
all
things
do
not
go
so
even
in
this
world
as
they
well
imagined
and
that
the
fairest
sunshine
of
marriage
may
be
somtimes
darkned
with
a
cloudy
storm
you
married
people
that
have
the
help
of
a
receive
a
much
greater
advantage
in
participating
of
the
pleasures
of
marriage
neither
need
you
to
be
troubled
with
tossing
dandling
of
the
child
in
the
night
o
young
this
is
a
most
incomparable
pleasure
for
you
for
now
you
may
most
certainly
see
the
approach
of
a
daughter
to
your
son
and
by
that
means
reap
the
possession
again
of
all
those
former
pleasures
by
every
one
be
saluted
with
the
title
that
you
are
an
excellent
good
artist
if
it
be
so
be
carefull
that
you
do
not
gad
up
and
down
with
your
wife
too
much
on
horseback
or
in
coaches
for
fear
it
might
make
her
miscarry
but
you
have
learnt
all
these
things
well
enough
at
the
first
and
without
doubt
have
kept
them
well
in
remembrance
do
but
behold
in
the
mean
time
what
an
unexpressible
pleasure
your
dearly
beloved
hath
in
the
tricking
up
of
her
sweet
baby
in
the
most
neatest
dresses
what
a
world
of
pains
she
takes
spends
her
spirits
to
make
the
tailor
understand
according
to
what
fashion
she
will
have
it
made
to
hasten
him
that
all
things
may
be
ready
and
totally
finisht
against
sunday
next
o
new
father
now
open
your
eys
behold
what
a
pretty
son
you
have
how
happy
you
are
in
so
loving
and
understanding
a
wife
that
knows
how
to
trick
it
so
curiously
up
in
this
manner
she
was
never
better
pleased
undoubtedly
the
summer
nights
are
too
long
and
the
daies
too
short
for
her
to
gad
up
and
down
traversing
the
streets
of
the
city
that
she
may
fullfill
her
desire
of
shewing
it
to
every
body
never
was
any
thing
more
neatly
drest
but
the
nurse
and
the
maid
with
the
child
in
the
mean
while
at
jericho
for
their
very
backs
and
sides
seem
to
be
absolutely
broken
with
carrying
it
up
down
from
day
to
day
and
most
especially
when
the
child
is
wean
and
the
turn
away
the
maid
can
not
let
it
penetrate
into
her
brain
that
she
now
not
only
the
whole
week
must
rock
sing
dandle
dress
and
walk
abroad
with
it
but
that
she
is
upon
sundaies
also
bound
to
the
child
like
a
dog
to
a
halter
and
never
can
stir
out
as
she
formerly
did
to
walk
abroad
with
the
or
true
the
nor
so
much
as
go
once
to
give
a
visit
to
her
or
kindred
which
occasions
no
small
difference
between
the
maid
and
the
mistriss
but
good
house
father
never
trouble
your
self
at
it
for
this
belongs
also
to
the
pleasures
of
marriage
nor
do
not
seem
discontented
because
your
dearest
walks
abroad
thus
every
day
but
rather
think
with
your
self
she
takes
her
spinning
wheel
and
reel
along
with
her
and
if
in
her
absence
you
have
not
that
due
attendance
nor
find
that
in
the
house
and
kitchin
things
are
not
so
well
taken
care
for
why
then
you
must
imagine
to
be
satisfied
with
of
the
semstress
or
some
such
sort
of
person
as
well
as
you
were
when
you
enjoied
the
eighth
pleasure
you
must
also
observe
that
if
the
child
should
sit
much
it
might
get
crooked
legs
and
then
the
sweet
babe
were
ruined
for
ever
it
is
also
too
weak
yet
to
be
any
waies
roughly
handled
but
it
begins
from
day
to
day
to
grow
stronger
and
stronger
also
with
your
dearest
carrying
it
abroad
continually
to
visit
all
your
friends
and
acquaintance
it
learns
by
degrees
to
eat
all
things
and
drinks
not
only
beer
but
some
wine
too
and
i
assure
you
it
is
no
small
pleasure
for
the
father
and
mother
to
see
that
this
little
young
gosling
can
so
perfectly
distinguish
the
tast
of
the
wine
from
the
tast
of
the
beer
tho
when
it
is
come
to
some
elder
years
perhaps
they
would
give
a
hundred
pound
if
they
could
but
wean
it
from
it
but
that
too
far
to
be
lookt
into
and
care
too
soon
taken
makes
people
quickly
before
you
reach
this
length
yea
perhaps
before
some
few
weeks
are
at
an
end
you
will
see
this
sweet
babe
afflicted
with
either
the
measels
or
small
pox
and
then
wish
for
a
good
sum
of
mony
that
he
might
not
be
disfigured
with
them
in
having
many
and
it
is
no
wonder
for
who
knows
whether
he
may
be
past
and
measeling
when
he
is
five
twenty
years
of
age
but
on
the
contrary
there
may
then
perchance
appear
so
many
glimps
of
marriage
pleasures
from
him
that
such
small
things
will
not
be
once
lookt
at
for
if
your
wife
be
now
upon
a
new
reckoning
and
you
come
then
as
i
have
told
you
before
to
get
a
daughter
you
will
in
time
see
what
a
pretty
sweet
gentlewoman
grow
to
be
how
modestly
orderly
she
goes
to
learn
to
write
and
read
but
most
especially
to
prick
samples
which
perhaps
be
wholly
perfect
in
before
she
hath
half
learnt
to
sow
nay
its
probable
that
be
an
artist
at
the
making
of
though
she
was
never
taught
it
otherwise
both
you
her
mother
will
reap
an
extraordinary
pleasure
in
seeing
your
daughter
grow
up
in
all
manner
of
comly
and
civil
deportments
and
that
she
begins
to
study
in
the
book
of
manners
and
and
knows
also
how
to
dress
up
her
self
so
finically
with
all
manner
of
trinkum
trankums
that
all
the
neighbouring
young
gentlewomen
and
your
rich
neeces
esteem
themselves
very
much
honoured
with
the
injoiment
of
her
company
where
they
following
the
examples
of
their
predecessors
do
by
degrees
instruct
one
another
in
the
newest
fashions
finest
flanders
laces
the
difference
and
richness
of
stuffs
the
neatest
cut
gorgets
and
many
more
such
jincombobs
as
these
nay
and
what
more
they
begin
also
to
invite
and
treat
each
other
like
grave
persons
according
as
the
opportunity
will
allow
them
first
with
some
cherries
and
plums
then
with
some
filbuds
and
small
nuts
or
wallnuts
figs
and
afterwards
with
some
chesnuts
and
new
wine
or
to
a
game
at
cards
with
a
dish
of
tee
or
else
to
eat
some
pancakes
and
fritters
or
a
tansie
nay
if
the
coast
be
clear
to
their
minds
to
a
good
joint
of
meat
a
sallad
till
at
last
it
comes
so
far
that
through
these
delicious
conversations
they
happen
to
get
a
sweetheart
and
in
good
time
a
bedfellow
to
keep
them
from
slumbring
and
sleeping
and
it
is
very
pleasing
to
see
that
they
do
so
observe
the
making
good
of
the
old
proverb
old
birds
did
the
young
ones
sing
which
is
a
very
pleasant
happy
are
you
o
you
new
housholders
who
have
already
possessed
your
selves
of
so
many
pleasures
in
your
marriage
and
are
now
come
just
to
the
very
entrance
to
repossess
your
selves
of
them
over
again
and
perchance
never
depart
from
you
as
long
as
you
see
the
one
day
follow
the
other
be
not
backward
or
negligent
in
relating
your
happiness
to
others
but
if
there
be
any
distast
or
disaster
that
can
happen
in
the
married
estate
lock
it
up
in
the
very
closet
of
your
heart
and
abhor
everlastingly
the
thoughts
of
relating
it
then
you
will
have
many
that
will
pursue
your
footsteps
and
be
listed
into
your
company
then
also
will
your
estate
and
condition
be
famous
through
the
whole
world
conclusion
thus
long
you
have
seen
courteous
reader
how
that
those
married
people
who
are
but
indifferently
gifted
with
temporal
means
indeavour
to
puff
up
each
other
with
vain
and
airy
hopes
and
imaginations
perswading
themselves
that
all
the
troubles
vexations
and
bondages
of
the
married
estate
are
nothing
else
but
mirths
delights
and
pleasures
perhaps
to
no
other
end
but
to
mitigate
their
own
miserable
condition
or
else
to
draw
others
into
the
same
unhappy
snare
as
indeed
oftentimes
hapneth
but
it
is
most
sad
and
lamentable
that
the
meaner
sort
of
people
when
they
have
thrown
themselves
into
it
make
their
condition
a
thousand
times
worse
then
it
was
before
for
they
who
at
first
could
but
very
soberly
and
sparingly
help
themselves
do
find
when
they
are
married
that
they
must
go
through
not
only
ten
but
at
least
a
thousand
cares
and
vexations
and
all
what
hath
hitherto
been
said
of
the
ten
pleasures
is
only
spoken
of
the
good
and
most
agreeable
matches
and
not
of
any
of
those
which
many
times
are
so
different
and
contrary
of
humour
as
the
light
is
from
darkness
where
there
is
a
continual
hell
of
dissention
cursing
mumbling
and
maundring
nay
biting
scratching
into
the
bargain
which
for
the
most
part
is
occasioned
by
the
quarrelsom
crabbed
lavish
proud
opinionated
domineering
and
unbridled
nature
of
the
female
sex
besides
there
are
a
great
number
which
i
will
be
silent
of
who
do
all
they
can
to
please
others
and
cuckold
their
own
husbands
and
others
there
are
that
disguise
themselves
so
excessively
with
strong
waters
that
a
whole
day
long
they
can
hardly
close
their
so
that
you
need
not
wonder
much
if
you
see
the
greatest
part
of
women
tho
they
trick
themselves
never
so
finely
up
can
hardly
get
husbands
and
their
parents
are
fain
at
last
to
give
a
good
sum
of
mony
with
them
that
they
may
disburthen
themselves
of
them
insomuch
that
it
is
easie
to
be
seen
that
they
are
in
effect
of
less
value
then
old
iron
boots
and
shoes
for
we
find
both
merchants
and
mony
ready
alwaies
to
buy
those
commodities
therefore
o
you
that
are
yet
so
happy
as
to
have
kept
your
selves
out
of
this
dreadfull
estate
of
marriage
have
a
horror
for
it
shun
a
woman
much
more
than
a
fish
doth
the
hook
remember
that
solomon
amongst
all
women
kind
could
not
find
one
good
observe
by
what
hath
befallen
those
that
went
before
you
what
is
approaching
to
your
self
if
you
follow
their
footsteps
and
be
most
certainly
assured
that
the
acutest
pens
are
not
able
to
expound
the
light
feasiblest
troubles
and
disasters
of
marriage
set
then
aside
the
most
difficile
and
ponderous
do
but
read
with
a
special
observation
the
insuing
letter
of
a
friends
advice
touching
marriage
imprint
it
as
with
a
seal
upon
your
heart
and
lay
fast
hold
upon
that
golden
expression
of
the
glorious
apostle
is
good
for
man
not
to
touch
a
the
end
of
the
ten
pleasures
of
marriage
a
letter
from
one
friend
to
another
to
know
whether
it
be
advisable
to
i
must
acknowledge
that
the
letter
which
you
have
writ
me
hath
given
me
some
incumbrance
and
made
me
more
then
three
times
to
ruminate
upon
the
question
you
propounded
to
me
concerning
marriage
for
it
is
a
matter
of
great
importance
that
ought
to
be
well
pondered
and
considered
of
before
one
should
adventure
to
solemnize
celebrate
it
several
of
my
familiar
friends
have
troubled
me
touching
the
very
same
subject
and
i
gave
them
every
one
my
advice
according
as
they
were
affected
but
i
ought
not
to
deal
so
loose
and
unboundedly
with
you
by
reason
i
dare
speak
unto
you
with
more
freedom
and
truth
first
there
are
two
things
which
bind
me
strictly
to
you
nature
and
the
affection
and
moreover
the
great
knowledge
i
have
of
this
so
necessary
an
evil
i
will
tell
you
my
opinion
then
you
may
use
your
own
discretion
whether
you
will
approve
of
my
meaning
for
advice
or
not
for
my
part
i
beleeve
that
of
all
the
disasters
we
are
subject
to
in
our
life
time
that
of
marriage
takes
preference
from
all
the
rest
but
for
as
much
as
it
is
necessary
for
the
multiplying
the
world
it
is
fit
it
should
be
used
by
such
as
are
not
sensible
of
it
and
can
hardly
judge
of
the
consequences
thereof
neither
do
i
esteem
any
man
unhappy
let
whatsoever
disasters
there
will
happen
to
him
if
he
doth
not
fall
beyond
his
sence
so
far
as
to
take
a
wife
those
troubles
that
may
befall
us
otherwise
are
alwaies
of
so
small
a
strength
that
he
who
hath
but
the
least
magnanimity
may
easily
overpower
them
but
the
tortures
of
marriage
are
such
a
burthen
that
i
never
saw
no
man
let
him
be
as
couragious
as
he
would
which
it
hath
not
brought
under
the
yoke
of
her
tyranny
marry
then
you
shall
have
a
thousand
vexations
a
thousand
torments
a
thousand
dissatisfactions
a
thousand
plagues
and
in
a
word
a
thousand
sort
of
repentings
which
will
accompany
you
to
your
grave
you
may
take
or
chuse
what
sort
of
a
wife
you
will
make
you
every
day
repent
your
taking
of
her
what
cares
will
come
then
to
awake
and
disturb
you
in
the
middle
of
your
rest
and
the
fear
of
some
mischance
or
other
will
feed
your
very
spirit
with
a
continual
trouble
for
a
you
shall
have
the
children
to
awaken
you
out
of
sleep
their
lives
shall
hasten
your
death
you
shall
never
be
at
quiet
till
you
are
in
your
grave
you
will
be
pining
at
many
insufferable
troubles
and
a
thousand
several
cogitations
will
be
vexing
your
spirits
at
the
chargeable
maintenance
of
your
family
insomuch
that
your
very
soul
will
be
tormented
with
incessant
crosses
which
alwaies
accompany
this
evil
in
the
very
happiest
marriages
so
that
a
man
ought
in
reality
to
confess
that
he
who
can
pass
away
his
daies
without
a
wife
is
the
most
happiest
verily
a
wife
is
a
heavy
burthen
but
especially
a
married
one
for
a
maid
that
is
marriageable
will
do
all
that
ever
she
can
to
hide
her
infirmities
till
she
be
tied
in
wedlock
to
either
one
or
other
miserable
wretch
she
overpowers
her
very
nature
and
affections
changes
her
behaviour
covers
all
her
evil
and
wicked
intentions
she
dissembleth
her
hypocrisie
and
hides
her
cunning
subtleties
she
puts
away
all
her
bad
actions
and
masks
all
her
deeds
she
mollifies
both
her
speech
and
face
and
to
say
all
in
one
word
she
puts
on
the
face
of
an
angel
till
she
hath
found
one
or
other
whom
she
thinks
fit
to
deceive
with
her
base
tricks
and
actions
but
having
caught
him
under
the
slavery
of
this
false
apparition
she
then
turns
the
side
of
the
meddal
and
draws
back
the
curtain
of
her
vizards
to
shew
the
naked
truth
which
she
so
long
had
palliated
and
her
modesty
only
forbad
her
to
reveal
by
degrees
then
vomiting
up
the
venom
that
she
so
long
had
harboured
under
her
sweet
hypocrisie
and
then
is
repenting
or
the
greatest
understanding
of
no
worth
to
you
perhaps
you
may
tell
me
that
you
have
a
mistriss
who
is
fair
rich
young
wise
airy
and
hath
the
very
majestical
countenance
of
a
queen
upon
her
forehead
and
that
these
are
all
reasons
which
oblige
you
to
love
her
but
i
pray
consider
with
your
self
that
a
fair
woman
is
oftentimes
tempted
a
young
perillous
a
rich
proud
and
haughty
a
wise
hypocritical
an
airy
full
of
folly
and
if
she
be
eloquent
she
is
subject
to
speak
evilly
if
she
be
jocund
and
light
hearted
leave
you
to
go
to
her
companions
and
thinks
that
the
care
of
her
mind
is
with
you
in
your
solitariness
and
by
reason
she
can
flatter
you
so
well
it
never
grieves
you
if
she
be
her
freedom
of
spirit
will
appear
hypocritical
to
you
her
airiness
you
will
judge
to
be
tricks
that
will
be
very
troublesom
to
you
if
she
love
playing
ruine
you
if
she
be
liquorish
and
she
leads
your
children
the
ready
road
to
an
hospital
if
she
be
a
bad
housekeeper
she
lets
all
things
run
to
destruction
that
hath
cost
you
so
much
care
and
trouble
to
get
together
if
she
be
a
finical
one
that
will
go
rich
in
her
apparel
fill
the
shopkeepers
counters
with
your
mony
and
in
this
manner
her
lavishness
shall
destroy
all
your
estate
to
be
short
let
her
be
as
she
will
she
shall
never
bring
you
much
profit
in
good
troth
i
esteem
very
little
those
sort
of
things
which
you
imagine
to
have
a
great
delight
in
is
true
if
you
take
a
wife
which
is
ugly
poor
innocent
without
either
air
or
spirit
that
a
continual
burthen
to
you
all
your
life
time
the
old
are
commonly
despised
the
ugly
abhor
the
poor
slighted
and
the
innocent
laught
at
they
are
called
beasts
that
have
no
ingenuity
and
women
without
airiness
have
generally
but
small
sence
of
love
in
these
last
some
body
might
say
to
you
that
one
ought
to
take
of
them
that
are
indifferently
or
reasonably
well
qualified
but
i
will
surge
a
little
higher
and
tell
you
plainly
that
that
will
be
just
like
one
who
fearing
to
drown
himself
at
the
brinks
of
a
river
goeth
into
the
middle
to
be
the
higher
above
water
you
see
now
why
i
can
not
advise
you
to
marry
yet
i
would
not
have
you
to
beleeve
tho
i
so
much
discommend
it
that
it
is
no
waies
usefully
profitable
i
esteem
it
to
be
a
holy
institution
ordained
by
god
almighty
that
which
makes
it
bad
is
the
woman
in
whom
there
is
no
good
if
you
will
marry
you
must
then
conclude
never
to
be
any
thing
for
your
self
again
but
to
subject
your
self
to
the
toilsom
will
and
desires
of
a
wife
most
difficult
to
be
born
with
to
pass
by
all
her
deficiences
to
assist
her
infirmities
to
satisfie
her
insatiable
desires
to
approve
of
all
her
pleasures
whatsoever
she
also
will
you
must
condescend
to
now
you
have
heard
and
understood
all
my
reasons
and
arguments
you
may
then
tell
me
that
you
have
a
fine
estate
and
that
you
would
willingly
see
an
heir
of
your
own
that
might
possess
it
and
that
it
would
be
one
of
your
greatest
delights
to
see
your
own
honour
and
vertues
survive
in
your
children
but
as
to
that
answer
you
and
say
that
your
reward
shall
be
greater
in
relieving
the
poor
and
needy
then
to
leave
rich
remembrances
to
heirs
and
procure
you
an
everlasting
blessing
that
you
might
otherwise
leave
for
a
prey
to
your
children
who
it
may
be
are
so
bastardized
in
their
birth
that
they

i

thee

for

the
second

pleasures
of

introduction
it
is
an
inexpressible
pleasure
for
travellers
when
after
many
traverses
and
tossings
too
and
again
they
return
quietly
home
to
their
studies
and
rememorates
all
the
unexpected
pleasure
that
they
encountred
with
upon
the
one
coast
and
the
horrible
vexations
and
confusions
that
they
had
upon
another
and
the
very
penning
thereof
doth
as
it
were
anew
repossess
them
of
all
the
pleasures
and
conveyeth
them
through
all
the
countries
without
so
much
as
the
least
moving
of
a
foot
just
so
it
goes
with
those
that
have
been
under
the
bands
of
matrimony
and
are
loosed
from
them
these
being
then
come
to
be
solitary
at
rest
and
in
quiet
can
the
more
seriously
rememorate
and
recogitate
what
pleasures
they
injoied
at
one
and
what
thwartings
and
crosses
they
met
with
at
other
times
and
the
writing
down
of
these
doth
not
only
afresh
regenerate
in
them
the
received
pleasures
but
serves
also
for
a
to
all
married
couples
for
them
to
recogitate
what
pleasures
they
have
already
received
and
what
joys
are
still
approaching
towards
them
and
for
those
which
as
yet
know
not
the
sweetness
of
the
nuptial
estate
it
serves
for
a
that
they
may
with
all
earnestness
sail
unto
it
and
possess
those
joys
also
of
those
we
have
before
demonstrated
unto
you
ten
pleasant
tables
but
because
the
scale
of
marriage
may
hang
somwhat
evener
and
not
fall
too
light
on
the
womens
side
we
shall
for
the
courteous
reader
add
unto
them
ten
pleasures
more
being
that
which
some
married
people
have
since
confessed
or
to
be
short
with
you
was
formerly
wink
at
and
passed
over
illustration
by
the
navarre
society
the
first
pleasure
young
couple
begin
to
keep
shop
and
demand
their
promised
till
now
o
new
married
couple
you
have
passed
through
the
first
part
of
your
wedlock
with
feasting
and
pleasures
and
have
injoied
no
smal
delights
in
it
but
what
is
there
in
this
world
that
we
grow
not
weary
of
you
have
seen
that
the
sumptuosest
feast
full
of
delicate
dishes
and
the
pleasurablest
country
scituations
with
al
their
rich
fruits
finally
cloggeth
through
the
continual
injoyment
of
them
nevertheless
it
is
the
generall
desire
of
all
persons
forasmuch
as
it
is
possible
to
live
in
the
world
in
pleasure
and
delights
amongst
the
rest
the
gain
of
mony
is
none
of
the
smallest
pleasures
and
this
appears
to
be
the
least
burthensom
tho
it
have
much
trouble
in
it
therefore
is
it
very
much
commendable
o
young
couple
though
you
have
a
pretty
estate
of
your
own
according
as
your
contract
of
marriage
testifies
and
as
we
have
also
seen
by
the
wedding
you
kept
your
apparel
and
the
other
ap
and
dependances
that
you
begin
to
meditate
how
to
make
the
best
benefit
of
your
stock
and
so
much
the
more
because
your
predecessors
got
it
with
a
slavish
diligence
reaped
it
together
with
sobriety
kept
it
with
care
and
finally
left
it
unto
you
for
your
great
pleasure
it
is
then
also
not
strange
if
you
as
true
bred
children
keep
it
carefully
and
make
the
best
profit
of
it
to
the
end
that
your
successors
when
time
shall
serve
may
find
that
they
have
had
frugall
parents
and
so
walk
in
your
footsteps
verily
this
is
one
of
the
necessariest
meditations
in
the
world
if
we
could
but
any
waies
make
the
dead
sensible
of
it
in
their
grave
undoubtedly
the
reliques
of
your
parents
would
rejoice
at
so
happy
and
carefull
an
intention
of
you
their
children
and
truly
what
is
there
among
other
cogitations
more
pleasurable
then
to
begin
with
a
handsom
for
this
through
the
daily
gain
yeelds
every
day
new
pleasures
and
by
consequence
a
merry
life
is
true
merchandize
bears
a
greater
respect
and
yeelds
also
sometimes
great
gains
but
with
these
trouble
somtimes
it
is
for
the
most
part
subject
to
great
and
weighty
losses
which
is
the
destruction
of
young
people
and
so
intangles
the
merriest
part
of
their
lives
that
fears
and
cares
deprives
them
of
their
night
rest
if
the
wind
blow
hard
they
are
presently
in
a
fear
that
the
ships
at
sea
laden
with
their
goods
and
wares
may
be
shipwrack
if
they
will
assure
them
then
the
assurer
goes
away
with
the
profit
and
they
are
also
so
greedy
and
cunning
that
the
least
storm
or
bad
tiding
makes
them
very
slow
and
circumspect
or
if
they
be
not
so
it
is
to
be
feared
so
there
happen
many
losses
that
then
the
assurer
himself
might
come
to
be
lost
but
the
handsom
is
the
surest
and
pleasurablest
for
every
moment
you
get
new
customers
as
well
from
abroad
as
at
home
who
buy
continually
with
ready
mony
or
otherwise
pay
the
old
score
and
trust
the
new
yea
all
the
news
that
goes
about
the
city
is
brought
home
and
imparted
to
you
there
not
a
man
dies
or
woman
brought
to
bed
but
you
have
knowledge
of
it
well
then
what
greater
pleasure
can
there
be
then
this
also
young
woman
you
may
through
love
and
care
herein
be
assistant
to
your
husband
oftentimes
which
you
can
not
do
in
merchandize
and
so
by
degrees
learn
to
understand
the
shop
and
converse
neatly
with
the
customers
whereby
you
can
in
his
absence
also
help
the
customers
and
give
them
pleasing
answers
insomuch
that
you
oftentimes
attain
to
as
perfect
a
knowledge
of
the
trading
as
your
husband
himself
you
are
happy
yea
ten
times
over
happy
o
housewively
young
woman
in
this
choice
and
that
not
only
for
your
husband
but
principally
for
your
self
for
if
that
mischance
might
happen
to
you
that
death
should
bereave
you
of
your
husband
you
find
your
self
oftentimes
setled
in
a
way
of
trading
which
you
can
manage
your
self
and
set
forward
with
reputation
nay
though
you
might
happen
to
have
children
you
have
the
opportunity
your
self
to
bring
them
up
in
the
same
way
and
so
get
a
due
faithfull
and
carefull
assistance
from
them
which
will
not
so
well
be
done
by
men
and
and
over
whom
there
is
seldom
so
much
command
as
over
ones
own
children
and
if
your
husband
continue
in
health
and
find
that
trading
grows
quick
he
perceives
that
by
the
assistance
of
his
wife
something
else
may
be
taken
by
the
hand
that
is
also
profitable
and
then
he
will
alwaies
exercise
some
sort
of
merchandise
that
is
secure
and
advantagious
it
is
most
certain
sweet
woman
you
will
be
the
more
tied
to
your
housekeeping
and
can
not
so
often
go
to
visit
and
take
your
pleasure
with
your
gossips
as
you
formerly
did
in
coaches
or
by
water
as
if
your
husband
had
taken
any
sort
of
merchandice
in
hand
because
that
a
woman
who
is
married
to
a
shopkeeper
is
as
it
were
also
wedded
to
the
counter
by
reason
you
dare
not
trust
your
shop
to
old
much
less
to
new
men
or
because
they
do
not
perfectly
understand
the
trade
and
thereby
also
find
occasion
to
make
one
bed
serve
for
both
and
junket
together
which
makes
no
small
confusion
in
the
family
but
little
regard
must
be
taken
about
that
for
the
importantest
must
alwaies
be
taken
care
of
and
be
assured
if
the
desire
of
gain
small
trading
and
bad
paiment
begin
once
to
take
possession
of
you
the
thoughts
of
all
the
former
pleasures
will
remove
and
you
will
exchange
them
for
those
that
are
more
noble
and
becoming
in
the
well
governing
of
your
men
and
in
the
shop
and
house
and
taking
inspection
that
they
be
obedient
unto
you
the
family
must
be
wel
taken
care
of
going
to
market
with
the
maid
to
buy
that
which
is
good
and
let
her
dress
it
to
your
mind
and
every
market
day
precisely
with
the
maid
neatly
drest
and
following
you
with
a
go
to
take
a
view
of
newgate
cheapside
and
the
poultry
markets
and
afterwards
when
your
got
a
little
farther
then
to
have
your
baby
carried
by
you
neatly
and
finically
drest
up
and
in
hearing
of
it
whilest
it
is
in
the
standing
stool
calling
in
its
own
language
so
prettily
daddy
and
mammy
o
that
is
such
an
extraordinary
pleasure
that
where
ever
you
go
what
soever
you
delight
in
all
your
delight
is
to
be
at
home
again
in
your
shop
by
your
servants
and
most
especially
when
you
have
it
to
be
by
your
baby
and
if
you
do
get
a
fit
to
be
gadding
abroad
with
some
of
your
friends
and
neighbours
for
one
can
not
alwaies
be
tied
as
if
they
were
in
bridewell
nor
the
bow
ever
stiff
bent
why
then
you
have
which
may
as
well
be
used
for
pleasure
as
devotion
and
if
that
be
too
short
presently
follows
whitsontide
then
you
may
sing
tantarroraara
three
daies
together
and
get
your
fill
of
it
so
that
you
may
find
time
enough
to
take
your
delight
and
pleasure
tho
you
be
a
little
tied
to
a
shop
this
being
then
in
such
manner
taken
into
a
ripe
deliberation
by
some
of
the
nearest
relations
it
is
concluded
on
to
set
up
a
handsom
shop
and
to
furnish
it
with
al
sorts
of
necessaries
and
by
that
means
make
that
you
may
alwaies
say
yea
and
never
no
to
the
customers
o
how
glad
the
good
woman
is
now
she
sees
that
her
husband
who
is
otherwise
somewhat
stifnecked
lets
himself
be
perswaded
to
this
by
his
friends
and
how
joyfull
is
the
husband
that
his
wife
who
at
first
seemed
to
be
is
now
herewith
so
absolutely
contented
o
happy
match
where
the
delight
and
pleasure
of
both
parties
is
bent
upon
one
subject
how
fast
doth
this
writhe
and
twist
the
bands
of
wedlock
and
love
together
certainly
to
be
of
one
mind
may
very
well
be
said
to
be
happily
married
and
called
a
heaven
upon
earth
here
they
are
cited
to
appear
who
display
the
married
estate
too
monstrously
as
if
there
were
nothing
but
horrors
and
terrors
to
be
found
in
it
now
they
would
see
how
that
love
in
her
curious
crusible
melteth
two
hearts
and
ten
sences
together
to
this
all
chymists
vail
their
bonnets
though
they
brag
of
their
making
the
hardest
minerals
as
soft
as
milk
and
butter
this
art
surpasseth
all
others
yet
here
ought
to
be
considered
what
sort
of
trading
shall
be
pitcht
upon
the
man
hath
good
knowledge
in
cloath
silk
stufs
french
manufactures
and
galantries
but
the
woman
thinks
it
would
be
much
better
if
they
handled
by
the
gross
in
italian
confits
candied
and
musk
sugar
plums
raisons
of
the
sun
figs
almonds
pistaches
bon
christian
pears
and
dried
fruits
together
with
greek
and
spanish
wines
delicate
sack
muskadine
and
frontinyack
wine
which
is
a
negotiation
pleasing
to
the
ey
delicious
for
the
tast
and
beloved
by
all
the
world
and
by
this
she
thinks
she
shall
procure
as
many
customers
as
her
husband
because
she
hath
familiar
acquaintance
with
severall
brave
gentlewomen
that
throw
away
much
mony
upon
such
commodities
and
make
many
invitations
treats
and
feastings
and
she
her
self
could
alwaies
be
presently
ready
when
she
received
an
honourable
visit
o
happy
man
who
hath
gotten
such
an
ingenious
understanding
wife
that
takes
care
and
considers
with
her
self
for
the
doing
all
fit
and
necessary
things
to
the
best
advantage
and
really
she
is
not
one
jot
out
of
the
way
for
this
sort
of
merchandize
is
both
relishing
and
delightfull
and
must
be
every
foot
bought
again
now
the
time
requires
going
to
market
to
buy
fir
oak
and
sackerdijne
wood
and
to
order
that
the
shop
may
be
neatly
built
and
set
up
and
you
are
happy
that
master
paywell
who
is
a
very
neat
joiner
and
is
of
your
very
good
acquaintance
and
so
near
by
the
hand
he
knows
how
to
fit
and
join
the
pannels
most
curiously
together
and
so
inlaies
shaves
and
polishes
the
fine
wood
that
you
would
swear
it
is
all
of
one
piece
well
here
again
is
another
new
pleasure
and
delight
if
all
things
go
thus
forward
certainly
the
will
in
a
short
time
be
at
the
least
a
span
too
little
o
how
glad
be
when
this
trouble
is
but
once
over
and
that
the
shop
is
neatly
built
painted
gilt
furnished
and
finely
put
into
a
posture
o
how
nobly
it
appears
and
how
delightfull
and
pleasing
it
will
be
when
this
new
negotiant
sees
his
shop
full
of
customers
and
he
at
one
counter
commending
praising
and
selling
and
one
servant
bringing
commodities
to
him
and
another
hath
his
hands
full
with
measuring
and
weighing
and
his
beloved
at
another
counter
finds
imploiment
enough
with
telling
mony
weighing
of
gold
and
discoursing
with
the
customers
then
it
wil
not
seem
strange
unto
you
how
it
came
to
pass
that
your
predecessors
got
such
fine
sums
of
mony
together
and
left
them
unto
you
to
be
merry
with
therefore
you
ought
also
even
as
they
did
to
provide
your
selves
with
a
curious
and
easie
to
be
remembred
sign
because
your
customers
by
mistake
might
not
come
to
run
into
your
neighbors
shops
i
have
not
yet
forgotten
that
your
grandfather
being
a
wollen
draper
first
hung
out
the
sign
of
the
sheep
and
his
name
was
james
thomson
but
by
reason
of
his
great
custom
they
called
him
by
the
nick
name
of
james
in
the
sheep
which
remains
still
as
a
name
to
the
generation
and
in
like
manner
your
wives
grandfather
a
well
customed
shopkeeper
in
whose
name
was
william
jackson
hung
out
the
sign
of
the
silkworm
but
his
son
going
to
school
with
another
boy
whose
name
was
also
william
jackson
for
the
making
a
distinction
between
them
they
gave
him
the
name
of
william
the
silkworm
which
also
remains
as
a
name
to
the
family
this
is
not
common
only
among
the
londoners
but
in
other
cities
and
country
towns
also
among
coachmen
wagoners
and
others
but
come
we
wil
take
our
leaves
of
these
people
and
turn
again
to
our
new
married
couple
who
can
hardly
rest
quietly
a
nights
for
the
earnest
desire
they
have
to
see
all
things
accomplished
and
their
trading
going
forward
and
in
time
tom
thumb
got
on
his
doublet
tho
he
was
seven
years
pulling
on
the
first
sleeve
yet
before
you
come
to
this
great
pleasure
meet
with
a
troublesom
obstruction
in
the
way
which
if
you
can
but
turn
of
bravely
it
will
be
much
the
pleasanter
for
before
the
shop
is
fully
furnisht
you
will
see
what
there
will
be
wanting
to
fill
all
the
corners
and
places
with
commodities
that
must
be
sold
by
length
of
time
and
to
stand
out
the
trust
and
also
with
patience
and
meekness
expect
the
coming
of
mony
from
slow
and
bad
paymasters
therefore
it
begins
to
be
time
to
speak
of
the
promised
portion
uds
bud
what
a
racket
is
here
now
for
the
young
mans
father
had
made
his
full
account
that
he
should
not
already
be
dun
for
the
promised
portion
not
doubting
but
that
the
young
womans
lay
all
totally
ready
told
of
in
bags
and
thought
to
take
it
in
the
best
sence
i
will
pay
my
son
his
interest
yearly
and
afterwards
in
peaceable
times
when
there
little
or
no
impositions
and
that
my
coffers
are
better
furnisht
will
then
give
him
the
principal
and
seriously
the
old
man
seems
to
deal
herein
very
cordially
since
other
mens
fathers
do
not
do
half
so
well
and
only
give
this
for
an
answer
young
men
must
be
promised
and
with
daughters
must
be
and
others
make
their
sons
give
them
a
bond
wherein
he
as
by
example
acknowledgeth
to
be
indebted
to
his
father
six
hundred
pound
whereupon
the
father
closes
the
match
and
promiseth
to
give
in
marriage
with
his
son
six
hundred
pound
which
at
last
comes
to
nothing
at
all
and
only
serves
for
a
perfect
cheat
to
deceive
and
the
eys
of
the
pretended
gentlewoman
and
her
guardians
it
is
no
wonder
where
such
matches
are
made
if
when
such
things
are
discovered
there
be
a
great
deal
of
time
spent
before
they
can
come
to
the
true
pleasure
but
you
o
new
married
man
who
have
a
liberal
father
on
your
side
you
can
get
provisionally
your
interest
and
when
times
mend
your
principal
perhaps
it
will
not
be
half
so
well
with
your
wives
estate
for
she
it
may
be
in
her
maiden
estate
hath
spent
and
run
out
more
in
gaudy
apparel
to
intice
a
lover
then
the
interest
of
her
estate
could
bear
insomuch
that
the
principal
is
diminished
or
the
revenues
thereof
received
and
consumed
long
before
they
were
due
wounds
in
what
a
sweat
and
fear
with
these
sort
of
cogitations
is
this
approaching
new
in
how
earnestly
he
runs
to
her
guardians
to
see
if
they
will
unriddle
him
this
doubt
that
he
is
in
but
to
his
good
fortune
he
finds
it
in
a
much
better
condition
than
he
thought
he
should
for
his
dearest
hath
spent
much
less
in
her
apparelling
and
maintenance
then
she
could
have
done
so
that
not
only
mony
in
stock
but
rents
of
her
real
estate
that
are
yet
to
be
paid
unto
her
though
there
was
very
much
consumed
for
her
brides
apparel
and
the
other
accoutrements
well
this
is
an
extraordinary
pleasure
and
a
great
comfort
for
his
panting
heart
uds
life
how
many
hundred
kisses
are
now
offered
at
the
altar
of
her
sweet
lips
that
otherwise
would
not
so
much
as
have
been
thought
upon
therefore
one
may
easily
perceive
that
mony
increaseth
love
very
much
and
that
lovers
in
these
times
are
so
bent
upon
mony
and
so
diligent
in
search
of
it
is
no
admiration
nay
they
scruple
not
to
inquire
of
the
guardians
and
up
and
down
by
unsworn
brokers
who
negotiate
with
a
very
close
intelligence
in
this
sort
of
and
draw
ten
double
salaries
and
that
ofttimes
too
from
both
sides
if
they
can
but
help
anyone
to
a
good
bargain
and
that
he
obtains
access
and
afterwards
wheedle
it
about
so
that
it
finally
comes
to
be
a
match
but
what
sad
issue
generally
such
sort
of
matches
are
attended
with
is
well
known
to
the
whole
world
you
o
lovers
who
seek
to
be
livry
men
of
the
great
company
and
aim
to
possess
the
pleasures
of
marriage
have
a
care
of
the
inchanting
voices
of
these
crafty
syrens
because
they
intend
to
batter
you
upon
the
and
where
the
hellish
furies
seem
to
keep
their
habitation
these
are
the
only
occasioners
of
bad
matches
and
such
as
raise
a
scandal
of
that
estate
which
at
once
affoards
both
pleasure
mirth
and
joy
illustration
by
the
navarre
society
but
our
new
married
couple
went
clear
another
way
to
work
who
now
to
their
full
contentment
act
so
many
pretty
apish
tricks
injoy
such
multiplicities
of
kindnesses
and
toss
each
other
such
quantities
of
kisses
as
if
there
were
a
whole
kingdom
or
at
the
least
a
vast
estate
to
be
gained
thereby
so
that
they
find
that
in
that
estate
there
are
not
only
ten
but
a
thousand
pleasures
cemented
together
in
it
whereof
in
the
following
shall
be
demonstrated
in
some
part
the
imperfect
gloss
but
never
the
accomplished
portrait
the
second
pleasure
husband
grows
pipsy
and
keeps
the
first
takes
the
doctors
advice
is
mocked
by
his
just
as
one
candle
lights
another
so
we
see
also
that
two
sympathetically
minded
know
by
the
cleaving
of
their
lips
together
how
to
breathe
into
each
other
their
burning
wherewith
the
one
doth
as
it
were
kindle
the
other
and
do
every
moment
renew
and
blow
on
again
their
even
just
now
extinguished
delights
of
this
you
have
here
a
pattern
from
our
late
married
for
whom
the
longest
summer
daies
and
winter
nights
fall
too
short
to
satisfy
their
affections
they
hardly
know
how
to
find
out
time
that
they
may
bestow
some
few
hours
in
taking
care
for
the
ordring
and
setting
all
things
in
a
decent
posture
in
their
new
made
shop
imagining
that
they
shall
alwaies
live
thus
in
the
fire
without
being
ever
indamaged
by
it
but
time
will
teach
them
this
better
in
the
mean
while
we
will
make
our
selves
merry
with
the
pleasure
of
this
married
couple
who
see
now
their
shop
fully
in
order
furnisht
with
severall
brave
goods
and
a
pretty
young
fellow
to
attend
it
but
because
customers
do
not
yet
throng
upon
them
they
find
no
other
pastime
then
to
entertain
each
other
in
all
manner
of
kind
imbracements
and
to
chear
up
their
hearts
therein
to
the
utmost
here
it
may
be
plainly
seen
how
pleasant
and
delightfull
it
is
for
the
young
woman
because
her
physiognomy
begins
to
grow
the
longer
the
more
frank
and
jocund
that
to
us
her
countenance
doth
display
her
souls
content
e
since
her
wedding
but
just
as
a
burning
candle
doth
consume
though
to
it
self
insensible
yet
maketh
of
hers
joyfull
by
its
light
so
doth
our
new
married
man
before
few
months
are
expired
find
that
he
becomes
the
very
subject
of
flouting
at
and
laughter
among
his
former
boon
companions
because
every
one
jestingly
tells
him
that
he
is
sick
of
a
fever
that
the
paleness
of
his
face
the
lankness
of
his
cheeks
and
thinness
of
his
calves
doth
shew
it
most
plainly
and
verily
there
are
some
artificial
jesters
who
do
it
so
neatly
that
he
himself
beleeves
it
almost
to
be
true
yet
nevertheless
to
avoid
their
mockeries
casts
it
of
from
him
as
far
as
possible
may
be
but
his
own
opinion
doth
so
clearly
convince
him
that
in
himself
he
ponders
and
considers
what
course
is
best
to
be
taken
but
housoever
as
long
as
he
goes
and
walks
up
and
down
eats
and
drinks
he
thinks
that
the
tide
will
turn
again
yet
finding
himself
inwardly
weaker
of
body
rallies
with
his
own
distemper
in
hopes
that
by
his
jesting
among
his
merry
companions
he
may
from
them
understand
what
is
best
upon
such
occasions
to
be
done
or
avoided
and
they
seriously
jesting
say
to
him
o
friend
wean
yourself
from
your
wife
and
tobacco
and
drink
chocolate
and
eat
knuckles
of
veal
or
else
become
like
one
of
pharaohs
lean
kine
oh
ho
thinks
he
if
that
be
true
i
have
spent
my
reckoning
this
evening
very
happily
now
young
woman
do
you
admire
if
your
husband
comes
home
at
night
discontented
in
mind
for
his
wits
run
a
and
he
has
walkt
in
a
dump
from
towerhill
to
tuttle
fields
contriving
what
best
for
him
to
do
and
how
to
compass
the
matter
neatly
for
to
remain
so
from
his
dear
and
delicate
wife
not
paying
unto
her
the
usual
family
duty
is
below
the
generosity
of
a
man
and
to
tell
her
what
the
matter
is
is
yet
worse
to
leave
of
tobacco
and
eat
knuckles
of
veal
is
feasible
but
to
go
to
a
coffehouse
and
alwaies
drink
chocolate
that
sticks
against
the
stomack
nevertheless
necessity
hath
no
law
and
the
occasion
overpowers
affection
insomuch
that
after
a
thousand
pondrous
considerations
he
resolves
to
deny
his
dearly
beloved
wife
a
little
of
that
same
and
to
that
purpose
will
somtimes
in
an
evening
feign
to
have
the
headake
or
that
he
is
very
dull
and
sleepy
which
is
no
absolutely
and
thereby
commands
his
man
to
call
him
up
somtimes
very
early
in
the
morning
as
if
there
were
forsooth
customers
in
the
shop
and
hunts
up
and
down
among
the
chocolate
dealers
to
get
of
the
very
best
preparing
it
himself
in
milk
treating
all
that
come
to
visit
him
with
chocolate
instead
of
tobacco
and
he
feigning
that
he
hath
an
extraordinary
delight
in
it
and
on
the
other
side
perswade
his
wife
that
he
has
a
huge
mind
to
eat
a
knuckle
of
veal
some
good
broath
and
egs
or
some
such
sort
of
pretty
conceited
diet
but
perceiving
that
this
avails
little
and
that
he
grows
rather
weaker
then
stronger
away
he
trots
to
the
scotch
paduan
doctor
who
immediately
prescribes
a
small
apothecaries
shop
at
the
least
twenty
or
more
several
sorts
of
herbs
to
be
infused
in
a
pottle
of
old
rhenish
wine
and
twice
a
day
to
drink
half
a
quartern
thereof
at
a
time
item
a
plaister
to
be
applied
to
his
stomack
and
an
unguent
for
the
pit
of
the
stomack
under
the
nose
and
to
chafe
the
temples
of
the
head
but
most
especially
to
keep
a
good
strengthning
diet
but
this
seems
to
have
too
much
stir
in
the
view
of
his
wife
therefore
must
be
laid
aside
and
away
he
goes
then
to
a
high
german
doctor
who
without
stop
or
stand
according
to
the
nature
of
his
country
begins
to
vaunt
as

oh
sir
you
are
a
brave
but
a
weak
knight
you
have
walkt
too
much
in
the
of
the
garden
and
plukt
too
often
from
the
if
you
make
not
use
of
my
noble
remedies
have
a
great
fit
of
sickness
but
if
you
do
take
it
be
very
quickly
and
dextrously
cured
in
such
a
manner
that
like
a
warriour
you
may
both
storm
and
take
the
fortress
and
triumph
over
it
be
sure
then
to
make
often
use
of
the
whites
of
geese
and
roasted
boild
with
fat
meat
old
hens
beaten
to
pieces
sweet
breads
sheeps
and
goats
milk
boild
with
rice
you
must
also
often
eat
calves
and
pigeons
brains
with
nutmeg
grated
in
them
and
drink
temperately
rhenish
wine
it
is
most
certain
that
by
a
frequent
doing
of
this
you
will
grow
both
able
and
strong
again
and
it
will
also
be
very
acceptable
to
your
dearly
beloved
here
stands
the
poor
cully
again
and
looks
like
a
dog
in
a
halter
and
perceives
that
this
doctor
jobbernole
gives
him
an
abundance
of
words
but
few
effects
for
his
mony
because
all
his
boasting
doth
for
the
most
part
contain
what
he
had
before
made
use
of
and
is
therefore
unwilling
to
trouble
his
wives
brain
with
all
that
boiling
and
stewing
and
all
the
rest
of
the
circumstances
this
makes
him
take
a
resolution
to
let
it
take
its
course
but
still
growing
weaker
and
weaker
is
at
last
fain
to
keep
his
bed
and
constrained
to
send
for
one
of
our
own
country
doctors
and
makes
his
complaint
to
him
that
he
is
troubled
with
an
excessive
weakness
in
the
reins
of
his
back
a
lameness
in
his
joints
that
he
can
hardly
lift
his
arm
to
his
head
together
with
a
foulness
of
his
stomack
which
makes
him
that
he
can
retain
nothing
but
is
to
vomit
all
up
again
out
of
all
which
reasons
the
doctor
perfectly
understands
the
ground
of
his
distemper
and
in
the
absence
of
his
wife
reveals
it
unto
him
o
how
delicately
these
cards
are
shufled
if
the
game
go
thus
forward
it
will
come
to
be
a
stately
pleasure
but
principally
for
the
doctor
who
privately
simpers
at
the
playing
of
his
own
part
and
never
fails
to
note
down
his
visits
but
most
especially
if
he
have
the
delivery
of
the
medicins
into
the
bargain
placing
them
then
so
largely
to
account
as
is
any
waies
possible
to
be
allowed
of
which
makes
the
apothecary
burst
out
into
such
a
laughter
as
if
he
had
received
the
tiding
of
a
new
bankrupt
but
go
you
forwards
doctor
it
must
be
so
you
have
not
studied
for
nothing
and
it
is
no
small
matter
to
be
every
time
ordering
of
new
remedies
especially
when
we
see
that
you
constantly
write
rx
rhenani
vetustissimi
generostssimi
m
and
then
again
to
eat
oftentimes
pistaches
almonds
custards
and
tansies
though
since
the
patient
like
making
a
martyr
of
himself
is
in
this
manner
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
doctor
his
dearly
beloved
wife
is
not
negligent
to
acquaint
all
the
friends
with
it
who
immediately
come
running
to
give
a
visit
to
the
sick
and
speak
words
of
consolation
to
the
good
woman
but
alas
grief
and
sorrow
hath
taken
such
deep
root
in
her
heart
that
no
crums
of
comfort
though
ever
so
powerfull
can
dispossess
her
calamities
for
the
seeing
of
a
husband
who
loved
her
so
unmeasurably
and
was
so
friendly
and
feminine
to
ly
sick
a
bed
would
stir
up
the
obdurest
heart
to
compassion
and
mollifie
it
with
showers
of
tears
but
even
as
all
the
relations
by
messengers
are
made
acquainted
with
this
sickness
report
in
like
manner
is
not
behind
hand
with
making
it
known
to
good
acquaintance
and
arch
jesters
who
as
i
shewed
you
before
are
very
ready
to
appear
with
their
flouts
and
gibes
and
instead
of
comforting
begin
to
laugh
with
the
patient
saying
o
sir
we
have
perceived
a
long
time
since
that
you
were
more
then
half
your
reckoning
and
that
your
was
much
nearer
then
your
wives
and
we
alwaies
thought
because
we
had
tasted
out
such
delicate
for
you
that
you
would
have
desired
us
to
have
taken
the
like
care
for
to
have
such
at
yours
and
afterwards
at
your
wives
yet
since
it
hath
not
so
hapned
we
hope
that
the
doctor
hath
taken
so
much
the
better
care
for
it
thus
rallying
they
begin
to
get
the
and
guess
at
the
same
time
as
if
it
had
been
told
them
that
the
doctor
in
his
last
receipt
had
ordered
rhenish
wine
and
just
as
the
women
in
the
eighth
pleasure
of
the
first
part
produce
abundance
of
remedies
the
assembly
of
men
do
here
in
like
manner
cast
up
a
hundred
receits
which
makes
the
maid
blush
and
be
most
cruelly
ashamed
at
but
behind
the
window
she
listens
most
sharply
to
hear
what
told
and
confessed
by
those
that
be
in
the
chamber
as
to
the
further
matter
of
fact
for
master
relates
that
as
he
was
travelling
the
last
summer
into
the
north
and
so
forwards
into
scotland
going
through
edenburgh
met
there
with
his
cousin
master
who
so
lean
and
that
master
told
him
in
truth
cousin
i
should
hardly
have
known
you
verily
you
look
as
if
you
were
troubled
and
i
beleeve
you
have
the
feeling
of
a
first
through
all
your
joints
well
cousin
saies
the
it
seems
that
you
are
deeply
studied
in
the
art
of
witchcraft
for
i
fear
its
too
true
i
went
from
home
on
purpose
to
take
my
pleasure
for
three
weeks
or
a
month
that
i
might
store
my
self
with
fresh
provisions
and
sing
a
sweet
ditty
in
commendations
of
my
betty
ho
ho
saith
master
flatter
not
your
self
with
such
a
fancy
that
get
as
much
up
again
in
three
weeks
or
a
month
as
you
have
been
running
behind
hand
in
four
if
do
well
let
for
a
frolick
go
into
france
there
a
gallant
air
and
we
shall
be
very
good
company
together
and
fear
not
but
that
make
much
of
our
selves
then
when
we
come
home
again
find
your
self
so
well
and
both
you
and
your
wife
will
be
thankfull
to
me
as
long
as
you
live
for
my
good
advice
of
taking
this
journy
to
be
short
the
cousins
travell
together
and
master
came
home
so
lusty
fat
and
plump
that
all
his
acquaintance
and
especially
his
hungry
wife
admired
mightily
that
he
was
so
fat
and
corpulent
at
this
all
the
burst
out
into
a
laughter
but
having
toss
up
their
cups
bravely
about
again
peggy
comes
in
with
a
fresh
kan
and
master
begins
to
relate
how
that
he
used
to
be
familiarly
acquainted
with
a
certain
brave
judge
who
had
a
bucksom
bouncing
lady
to
his
wife
the
judge
feigns
a
letter
which
at
noon
as
he
was
sitting
at
table
with
his
lady
was
brought
him
very
cleaverly
by
his
man
he
seemingly
unknowing
of
it
opens
and
reads
that
he
must
immediately
without
further
delay
go
upon
a
journy
having
read
that
prepares
himself
with
his
man
forthwith
to
be
going
but
whilest
the
judge
was
gone
into
his
closet
as
seeming
to
take
some
important
writings
along
with
him
the
lady
calls
his
man
privately
into
the
parler
and
forces
him
by
threats
of
her
displeasure
to
tell
her
who
delivered
him
that
letter
with
a
promise
of
her
favour
if
he
spoke
the
truth
whereupon
the
fellow
trembling
answered
madam
i
have
received
it
from
my
lord
the
judge
but
he
hath
strictly
commanded
me
to
keep
it
secret
so
that
if
he
come
to
know
that
i
have
mentioned
any
thing
of
it
to
your
ladiship
he
will
have
the
greatest
displeasure
of
the
world
against
me
do
not
you
fear
anything
said
her
ladiship
but
be
faithfull
in
what
you
do
a
pretty
while
after
the
judge
having
been
some
time
at
home
and
walking
with
his
lady
towards
their
garden
they
met
with
a
drove
of
sheep
having
but
one
ram
amongst
them
whereupon
her
ladiship
askt
sweetheart
how
comes
it
that
that
one
sheep
hath
such
horns
and
the
none
at
all
my
dear
said
he
that
is
the
ram
the
what
said
she
are
the
others
then
all
she
o
yes
my
love
answered
he
how
replied
she
but
one
ram
among
so
many
sheep
yes
hony
saies
the
judge
that
is
alwaies
so
then
sighingly
she
said
alas
poor
creature
how
must
you
long
then
to
walk
some
other
road
there
had
been
more
related
for
master
was
entred
upon
a
new
subject
but
because
the
doctor
came
in
they
were
constrained
to
break
of
but
the
starchster
being
busie
in
the
kitchin
with
the
mistriss
about
ordering
the
linnen
having
let
the
doctor
in
saith
mistriss
the
doctor
is
come
there
and
is
gone
into
the
chamber
by
my
truly
mistriss
i
hear
say
that
my
master
hath
got
a
fever
o
nel
saith
the
mistriss
this
is
clear
another
thing
this
sickness
is
not
without
great
danger
and
it
would
be
no
such
wonder
if
my
husband
hapned
to
dy
of
it
and
where
should
we
then
find
the
pleasures
of
marriage
that
some
arch
jesters
so
commonly
talk
of
but
kind
mistriss
be
not
so
hasty
it
is
impossible
to
express
all
the
pleasures
so
fully
in
one
breath
you
must
note
that
they
are
all
as
it
were
for
the
present
hid
behind
the
curtains
neither
must
you
expect
to
sail
alwaies
before
wind
and
tide
and
beleeve
me
there
are
yet
other
nuts
to
be
krackt
the
third
pleasure
the
husband
is
from
home
the
wife
plaies
the
divel
for
sake
the
husband
upon
his
journy
will
want
for
it
seemed
to
be
a
divellish
blur
in
the
escucheon
and
a
cruel
striving
against
the
stream
that
as
soon
as
the
shop
was
just
made
and
furnisht
then
the
good
man
falls
sick
and
keeps
the
first
lying
in
illustration
by
the
navarre
society
but
experience
having
taught
him
that
with
relishing
and
solid
dishes
a
man
may
overclog
himself
he
thinks
it
not
unadvisable
to
take
a
journy
now
and
then
from
home
to
see
if
he
can
get
some
new
customers
in
other
towns
or
buy
in
some
goods
and
wares
for
his
shop
by
which
means
he
may
as
well
take
as
good
care
for
his
health
as
he
doth
of
his
yet
what
comes
here
in
the
way
the
pleasure
is
so
great
and
their
loves
so
tender
and
newly
stamped
to
each
other
again
that
the
young
woman
thinks
she
shall
do
as
formerly
did
either
consume
her
self
in
tears
or
drown
her
self
in
a
river
if
she
must
suffer
this
oh
the
whole
world
will
be
unto
her
as
dead
and
without
any
thing
of
mankind
if
her
dearly
beloved
depart
from
her
well
who
will
not
then
but
beleeve
that
the
married
estate
is
full
of
incomprehensible
and
inexhaustible
pleasures
and
sweetnesses
do
but
behold
how
these
two
sing
loath
to
depart
yea
pray
observe
what
a
number
of
imbracings
how
many
thousand
kisses
and
other
toyisch
actions
are
used
before
this
couple
can
leave
one
another
nevertheless
the
reason
of
necessity
doth
forsooth
conquer
in
a
vigilant
husband
these
effeminate
passions
therefore
away
he
goes
leaving
his
whining
beloved
sitting
between
her
sister
and
her
neece
speaking
words
of
consolation
to
her
and
using
all
arguments
possible
to
enliven
and
make
her
sorrowfull
heart
merry
either
of
them
striving
to
be
most
free
in
proffering
to
be
her
bedfellow
and
the
next
day
to
keep
her
company
but
alas
saies
she
suppose
ye
did
all
this
yet
nevertheless
i
have
not
my
husband
with
me
but
because
time
and
good
company
help
to
decline
and
pass
away
sorrow
she
very
happily
begins
to
consider
that
she
hath
now
a
fit
opportunity
to
invite
her
neeces
and
bridemaids
and
other
good
acquaintance
with
whom
she
hath
been
formerly
mighty
familiar
to
come
and
take
a
treat
with
her
and
to
drink
a
dish
of
tee
for
they
have
when
she
was
in
her
maiden
estate
treated
her
so
many
times
with
tarts
pankakes
and
fritters
custards
and
stew
pruins
that
she
is
as
yet
ashamed
for
not
having
made
them
some
recompence
and
she
never
could
find
an
occasion
that
was
convenient
before
because
one
while
she
dwelt
with
her
guardians
and
at
another
time
with
her
uncle
who
took
very
sharp
notice
where
on
and
in
what
time
her
was
spent
and
consumed
that
they
continually
gave
her
for
trivial
expences
which
vext
her
so
much
the
more
because
the
treat
she
received
was
for
the
most
part
done
to
bring
her
acquainted
with
this
or
that
gentlewomans
brother
or
cousin
or
some
other
pretty
gentlemen
to
the
end
that
by
this
means
she
might
happen
to
make
a
gallant
match
and
indeed
the
first
original
of
the
wooing
and
acquaintance
with
her
beloved
had
there
its
foundation
to
treat
these
gentlewomen
when
her
husband
is
at
home
would
no
waies
appear
so
well
and
so
much
the
more
because
they
generally
suffer
themselves
to
be
conducted
to
the
place
by
one
or
other
of
their
gallants
who
then
either
very
easily
are
persuaded
or
it
may
be
of
themselves
tarry
to
take
part
with
them
therefore
this
must
be
done
and
concluded
on
because
she
hath
now
the
disposal
and
keeping
of
the
mony
as
well
as
her
husband
here
now
must
run
up
and
down
to
borrow
a
and
some
other
new
invented
to
bake
cheesekakes
and
custards
in
whilest
is
also
hardly
able
to
stand
longer
upon
her
legs
with
running
up
and
down
to
fetch
egs
flour
sugar
spices
blanch
almonds
the
mistriss
and
are
able
to
perform
this
duty
well
enough
for
they
both
helpt
to
do
it
very
neatly
at
her
neeces
but
the
must
be
spoken
to
for
the
making
a
delicate
minc
py
and
must
run
to
the
in
to
fetch
some
conserves
preserves
and
of
all
other
sorts
of
sweetmeats
raisins
of
the
sun
and
more
of
the
like
ingredients
for
she
knows
best
where
all
those
things
are
to
be
had
and
for
a
principal
dish
there
ought
to
be
a
pot
of
venison
a
couple
of
a
delicate
peece
of
martelmas
beef
some
anchovis
and
olives
for
the
gentlemen
because
they
certainly
will
accompany
the
gentlewomen
and
truly
they
that
bring
them
may
very
well
tarry
to
carry
them
home
again
it
is
also
but
one
and
the
same
trouble
goodman
twoshoes
is
gone
out
of
town
and
sees
it
not
neither
need
he
know
it
when
he
comes
home
he
treats
so
many
of
his
friends
and
acquaintance
and
then
again
next
day
following
invites
them
to
a
i
may
very
well
play
my
part
once
in
my
life
and
have
all
things
to
my
mind
let
come
o
what
will
who
knows
whether
such
another
occasion
may
happen
again
this
three
years
and
against
next
morning
very
privately
she
invites
the
gentlewomen
alone
to
come
about
nine
a
clock
in
the
morning
to
eat
hot
buns
and
cakes
for
then
they
come
precisely
out
of
the
oven
and
in
the
afternoon
again
to
some
curious
fruit
pankakes
and
fritters
and
a
glass
of
the
purest
canary
let
it
cost
so
much
or
be
fetcht
so
far
thus
runs
the
tongue
of
this
pretty
housewife
that
but
a
while
ago
was
so
sorrowfull
for
the
departure
of
her
beloved
husband
certainly
there
nothing
comes
out
more
suddenly
or
dries
up
more
easily
then
womens
tears
but
hangt
no
more
of
that
for
the
guests
will
be
here
presently
therefore
all
things
ought
to
be
in
order
for
mirth
and
moreover
there
there
are
some
of
them
that
frequent
baxter
puritanical
whose
heads
will
immediately
in
imitation
of
their
patron
hang
like
for
they
are
taught
to
mourn
with
the
sorrowfull
and
to
rejoice
with
the
joifull
but
it
is
now
a
time
to
be
merry
and
throw
away
masks
and
vizards
for
all
is
done
under
the
rose
and
among
good
acquaintance
and
verily
if
the
good
woman
had
not
this
or
some
such
sort
of
delight
where
should
we
find
the
pleasures
of
marriage
for
in
the
first
of
the
husband
there
was
no
looking
for
them
come
on
then
that
mirth
may
be
used
let
the
cards
also
be
brought
in
sight
which
formerly
out
of
a
puritanical
humour
ought
not
to
have
been
seen
in
a
house
nay
not
so
much
as
to
have
been
spoken
of
but
now
every
one
knows
how
to
play
artificially
at
put
all
fours
omber
pas
la
bete
bankerout
and
all
other
games
that
the
expertest
gamesters
can
play
at
and
who
knows
whether
they
do
not
carry
in
their
pockets
as
do
cards
that
are
cut
and
marked
they
learn
to
play
the
game
at
bankerout
so
well
with
the
cards
that
in
a
short
time
they
can
and
also
do
it
with
their
housholdstuf
wares
and
commodities
to
be
sure
alwaies
find
that
every
one
of
them
by
length
of
time
are
capable
of
setting
up
a
school
and
to
act
the
part
of
a
mistriss
and
most
especially
they
learn
to
discourse
very
exactly
touching
the
use
and
misuse
thereof
just
as
these
dissimulating
wigs
intend
to
do
though
indeed
men
have
never
seen
that
they
practised
this
lesson
themselves
but
although
the
mistriss
and
her
companions
know
little
or
nothing
of
these
tricks
they
serve
howsoever
without
setting
up
a
school
and
that
also
for
nothing
for
good
instructresses
to
their
servants
who
hereby
are
most
curiously
taught
what
paths
they
have
to
walk
in
and
what
best
for
them
to
do
that
they
may
follow
their
mistresses
footsteps
as
soon
as
their
master
and
mistriss
are
but
gone
abroad
together
who
then
know
so
exactly
how
to
dance
upon
those
notes
that
we
thought
it
necessary
as
being
one
of
the
principallest
pleasures
of
marriage
also
to
be
set
down
in
the
third
table
of
the
first
part
many
women
who
are
sick
of
this
liquorish
and
disease
will
be
grumbling
very
much
at
this
that
such
a
blame
and
scandal
should
be
cast
upon
their
innocent
sex
and
say
that
batchelors
hereby
will
be
afraid
to
marry
but
if
they
and
the
gentlewomen
that
were
in
private
domineering
together
had
not
gone
to
confession
and
made
a
publick
relation
of
it
who
would
have
known
it
therefore
this
sort
of
well
treated
female
guests
are
like
unto
those
that
when
they
have
gotten
a
delicate
bit
by
the
by
can
not
fare
well
but
they
must
cry
though
they
should
be
beaten
with
the
spit
for
it
but
the
good
ones
though
they
are
thin
sown
who
are
not
distempered
with
this
evil
never
trouble
themselves
at
what
one
will
say
or
another
write
concerning
women
because
their
guiltless
consciences
serves
them
as
well
as
a
thousand
witnesses
and
they
are
very
indifferent
whether
that
the
deceased
scandal
raiser
hippolitus
do
arise
and
come
into
the
world
again
daring
him
in
this
manner
then
hippolytus
out
from
thy
ghostly
nest
who
scandal
least
esteem
revenge
themselves
the
yet
howsoever
though
this
is
true
nevertheless
i
must
furnish
the
delicate
stomackt
ladies
with
some
sort
of
weapons
that
they
may
be
in
a
posture
of
defending
themselves
against
their
vituperous
enemies
for
verily
there
are
several
men
that
walk
not
so
even
and
neat
in
their
waies
as
they
ought
to
do
and
who
knows
whether
our
mistresses
dearly
beloved
at
this
very
present
doth
not
as
many
others
have
done
who
when
they
are
travelling
any
whither
the
first
thing
they
do
is
to
be
very
diligent
and
look
earnestly
about
whether
there
be
not
some
handsom
gentlewoman
that
travels
with
them
by
whom
they
very
courteously
take
place
shewing
themselves
mightily
humble
and
complacent
and
telling
them
that
they
are
batchelors
or
at
the
least
widowers
then
casting
out
a
discourse
of
playing
a
game
at
cards
that
they
may
the
better
see
what
mettle
the
lady
is
made
of
and
then
again
when
they
come
to
a
or
where
they
must
stay
the
night
over
there
they
domineer
lustily
with
them
and
play
the
part
of
a
rodomontade
where
many
times
more
is
acted
and
spent
then
they
dare
either
tell
their
wives
or
their
father
confessors
of
others
there
are
who
seek
not
so
much
such
company
but
very
artificially
before
hand
know
how
to
find
out
such
as
most
suit
with
their
own
humour
to
that
end
providing
themselves
with
some
bottles
of
canary
and
pure
spanish
tobacco
and
where
ever
they
come
are
sure
to
make
choice
of
the
best
inn
where
there
a
good
table
delicate
wine
and
a
handsom
wench
to
be
had
certainly
if
the
husband
thus
one
way
and
his
wife
another
know
how
to
find
out
the
pleasures
of
marriage
they
are
then
both
of
them
happy
to
the
utmost
is
it
not
possible
but
that
they
might
if
this
continued
long
take
a
journy
for
pleasure
to
for
at
first
it
was
by
them
esteem
too
mean
a
place
to
be
look
upon
and
not
worth
their
thinking
of
but
then
its
probable
it
may
come
into
their
considerations
by
reason
that
rents
are
low
there
provisions
very
cheap
and
pleasures
in
abundance
neither
hath
pride
or
ambition
taken
any
habitation
there
nay
who
knows
but
that
they
might
chance
to
observe
that
there
is
no
such
need
of
feasting
and
junketting
nor
be
subject
to
so
many
visits
because
there
dwells
not
such
a
number
of
their
friends
and
acquaintance
and
besides
all
this
you
may
there
for
a
small
matter
agree
with
the
collectors
of
the
excises
so
that
for
a
whole
year
you
may
have
wine
and
severall
other
things
plenty
for
little
or
nothing
but
let
lay
aside
all
this
because
they
are
untimely
cogitations
that
fly
astray
and
it
is
much
decenter
that
we
turn
again
to
our
mistriss
with
her
merry
companions
who
now
are
about
the
taking
leave
of
each
other
using
to
shew
their
gratitude
whole
bundles
full
of
complements
offering
them
up
with
an
inexpressible
amiablenes
and
eloquency
for
the
respect
and
honour
they
have
received
and
confirm
them
with
so
many
kisses
cursies
bows
and
conges
that
it
is
easie
to
be
perceived
that
on
both
sides
its
cordially
meant
and
doll
that
good
and
faithfull
servant
is
not
able
to
express
how
pleasing
this
entertainment
hath
been
to
all
the
company
nay
it
lies
buzzing
her
so
in
the
pate
that
she
can
not
be
at
quiet
in
a
morning
whilest
her
mistriss
is
asleep
but
she
must
with
the
neighbors
maids
either
at
the
opening
of
the
shop
or
sweeping
of
the
street
be
tatling
and
telling
of
it
to
them
putting
every
foot
into
their
hands
privately
some
almonds
and
raisins
that
came
in
by
de
relating
unto
them
as
if
she
did
it
by
a
scrole
what
a
horrible
quantity
of
things
she
hath
to
scour
and
wash
that
must
be
made
clean
and
set
in
order
against
the
time
that
the
bridemaids
as
it
was
mentioned
are
to
come
again
alone
and
so
much
the
more
because
her
master
is
daily
expected
home
who
then
finally
coming
in
is
not
ordinarily
welcomed
for
she
is
so
full
of
joy
that
her
husband
is
come
home
that
both
her
tongue
and
actions
are
incapable
of
demonstrating
her
felicity
and
he
on
the
side
is
so
glad
to
find
his
dearly
beloved
in
good
health
and
all
things
in
decent
order
that
it
is
beyond
imagination
all
this
while
they
both
laugh
in
their
sleeves
that
each
one
in
of
the
hath
taken
to
themselves
such
a
private
an
cunning
pleasure
finding
so
much
content
and
injoiment
therein
that
they
both
hope
to
serve
themselves
again
with
the
like
occasion
o
mighty
pleasure
of
marriage
who
would
not
but
be
invited
to
go
into
this
estate
especially
if
we
proceeded
to
write
down
and
rehearse
the
further
confession
of
the
separate
pleasures
of
man
and
wife
which
is
preserved
as
matter
for
the
insuing
fifth
and
sixth
pleasure
illustration
by
the
navarre
society
the
fourth
pleasure
wife
will
be
master
of
the
cash
or
mony
as
mony
is
one
of
the
most
curiousest
minerals
is
it
in
like
manner
the
less
admirable
that
the
handling
and
use
there
of
rendreth
the
greatest
pleasures
of
the
world
it
is
loves
fire
and
charities
fountain
yea
if
man
and
wife
in
their
house
keeping
may
be
esteemed
or
compared
to
the
sun
and
moon
in
the
firmament
verily
those
merry
white
or
yellow
boies
may
very
well
be
considered
of
as
twinkling
stars
it
rejoiceth
all
mankind
to
behold
in
the
sky
the
innumerable
multitude
of
glittering
stars
but
it
is
a
far
surpassinger
pleasure
that
the
new
married
couple
receive
when
they
see
vast
heaps
of
silver
and
gold
ly
dazling
their
eys
and
they
lording
over
it
you
o
lately
married
couple
possess
this
pleasure
to
the
utmost
you
have
to
your
content
received
your
promised
portions
you
onely
want
the
great
iron
to
lock
it
up
in
securely
and
to
keep
it
safely
that
it
may
be
laid
out
to
advantage
o
how
pleasant
the
free
dispensation
thereof
is
unto
you
what
a
noble
valley
it
is
to
walk
in
between
these
mountains
and
to
delight
your
eys
with
such
an
object
yet
nevertheless
o
faithfull
couple
here
is
need
that
a
great
deal
of
prudence
be
used
as
well
in
the
laying
of
it
out
as
the
preserving
of
it
in
ancient
times
it
hath
been
often
observed
and
taken
notice
of
that
where
mony
was
hid
the
places
were
generally
hanted
with
terrible
spirits
and
strange
ghosts
that
walked
there
coming
in
frightfull
apparitions
but
since
they
have
been
driven
out
of
our
country
and
houses
there
another
sort
of
imp
come
in
ten
times
wickeder
then
any
of
the
other
which
regards
nor
cares
neither
for
crosses
exorcisms
or
any
sort
of
but
dares
boldly
shew
himself
at
namely
a
which
sets
man
an
wife
together
by
the
ears
to
try
who
of
them
both
shall
have
the
command
and
government
of
the
cash
or
and
to
the
end
he
may
herein
act
his
part
well
he
knows
how
very
subtlily
first
to
fill
the
weak
womans
ears
full
that
she
ought
above
all
things
to
have
the
command
of
the
cash
because
she
had
such
a
great
portion
and
that
it
is
her
mony
which
she
hears
gingle
so
and
then
again
because
the
care
of
the
is
appropriated
to
be
her
duty
it
is
against
all
reason
that
she
like
a
servant
should
give
an
account
to
her
husband
what
wherefore
or
how
that
the
mony
is
laid
out
because
the
necessaries
also
for
are
so
many
that
they
are
without
end
name
or
number
and
it
is
impossible
that
one
should
relate
or
ring
them
all
into
the
ears
of
a
man
likewise
the
good
woman
can
not
have
so
fit
an
occasion
every
foot
to
be
making
some
new
things
that
she
may
follow
the
fashion
as
it
is
usual
for
women
to
do
much
less
to
have
any
private
to
treat
and
play
the
divel
for
god
sake
with
her
when
her
husband
is
gone
from
home
and
on
the
contrary
when
men
pay
out
any
thing
it
goes
out
by
great
sums
according
as
is
specified
by
the
accounts
delivered
which
must
be
set
to
book
and
an
acquittance
given
this
can
not
be
so
done
with
every
pittifull
small
thing
that
belongs
to
insomuch
that
the
husband
can
then
with
all
facility
demand
what
mony
is
needful
for
his
occasion
from
his
wife
moreover
when
the
wife
hath
the
command
of
the
mony
she
can
alwaies
see
in
what
condition
and
state
her
affairs
stands
and
by
taking
good
observation
thereof
her
husband
can
not
fob
her
off
with
pumpkins
for
musmillions
but
easily
perceive
whether
she
be
decreasing
or
increasing
in
her
estate
so
that
if
her
husband
might
come
to
dy
and
she
be
left
a
widow
with
several
children
she
can
immediately
see
and
understand
in
what
posture
her
affairs
stands
and
whether
she
be
gotten
forward
or
gone
backward
in
the
world
and
what
more
yet
it
would
be
a
great
shame
for
a
woman
who
hath
alwaies
been
so
highly
respected
by
her
husband
and
as
it
appeared
to
all
the
world
was
honoured
like
a
princess
that
she
should
within
dores
be
as
servile
as
a
servant
and
must
be
fed
out
of
her
husbands
hands
just
as
if
she
were
a
a
or
gamestress
with
these
and
a
thousand
such
like
arguments
doth
this
know
how
to
puff
up
the
vain
humours
of
the
weak
women
to
the
true
pitch
of
and
on
the
contrary
is
in
the
mean
while
busie
with
flatteries
to
stir
up
the
husband
to
idle
imaginations
and
demonstrating
unto
him
that
he
is
the
lord
and
guide
of
his
wife
created
to
command
her
and
she
to
obey
him
that
it
is
most
easie
to
be
perceived
what
a
noble
creature
man
is
whilest
that
woman
who
is
so
handsom
and
haughty
is
nevertheless
but
added
unto
him
as
a
servant
therefore
if
he
once
admit
his
wife
into
an
equality
with
him
he
will
then
be
subject
to
see
that
she
will
be
striving
for
the
predominancy
and
that
it
is
the
greatest
curse
imaginable
in
a
country
for
women
to
lordize
over
men
and
for
these
reasons
they
ought
to
be
but
like
the
nul
in
figures
and
to
be
kept
as
a
controuler
by
the
harth
the
pot
and
the
whilest
they
that
deliver
up
to
them
the
keys
of
the
are
deprived
of
all
their
superiority
and
like
men
unman
have
only
the
name
but
can
not
obtain
the
effect
in
such
manner
doth
as
yet
this
spirit
domineer
by
clear
daylight
in
many
of
the
principallest
houses
and
hearts
and
makes
oftentimes
so
great
a
difference
and
discord
about
the
key
of
the
cash
that
the
cash
it
self
seems
to
get
eagles
wings
and
swiftly
flies
away
whilest
the
husband
perceiving
that
the
wife
seeks
to
deceive
and
take
the
key
from
him
is
alwaies
possessed
with
abhominable
suspicions
certainly
thinking
that
she
is
minded
to
make
some
unnecessary
thing
or
other
or
to
hide
some
mony
from
him
which
makes
him
watch
her
waters
so
much
the
stricter
and
is
not
ashamed
to
give
out
and
make
what
he
hath
a
mind
to
for
his
own
pleasure
and
the
wife
perceiving
that
her
husband
is
so
sneaking
and
forsooth
so
circumspect
with
subtilety
contrives
and
practises
how
to
make
him
pay
out
mony
for
all
what
she
hath
any
waies
a
mind
to
by
that
means
making
her
self
mistriss
of
the
beyond
his
knowledge
though
he
hath
the
name
and
carries
the
keys
in
his
pocket
for
if
she
have
a
mind
to
new
stays
for
her
self
or
daughter
away
she
goes
to
a
buies
stuf
to
her
mind
and
causeth
it
to
be
made
as
modish
as
possible
may
be
and
having
tried
that
it
fits
and
pleases
her
fancy
fully
then
it
is
brought
home
by
one
or
other
of
her
trusty
acquaintance
who
come
at
a
convenient
time
appointed
just
like
some
petty
brokester
proffering
it
forsooth
in
sale
to
the
mistriss
and
tilling
her
a
relation
that
it
was
really
made
for
such
a
lady
but
that
she
died
whilest
it
was
making
and
for
that
reason
it
may
be
had
for
a
very
low
price
yea
that
it
is
such
a
cheap
bargain
that
perhaps
the
like
may
not
be
had
again
this
ten
years
thus
the
good
wife
knows
rarely
well
how
to
play
her
part
and
begins
to
reckon
how
many
ells
of
stuff
how
much
for
lining
and
the
making
thereof
would
come
to
cost
so
that
her
husband
by
reason
of
the
cheapness
is
curious
of
himself
to
desire
her
to
try
it
on
and
finally
sees
that
it
fits
her
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
her
to
be
short
after
much
cheapning
and
bargaining
the
price
is
concluded
on
though
it
be
against
the
husbands
stomack
or
the
cash
wel
can
bear
it
and
then
the
broker
is
ordered
when
she
hath
such
or
the
like
other
good
bargain
to
come
again
and
let
them
see
it
in
this
manner
the
wife
fetches
about
by
the
by
as
much
as
she
can
and
hoodwinking
her
husband
as
she
pleases
for
at
other
times
there
comes
to
be
sold
napkins
and
then
again
coats
sheets
blankets
and
all
sorts
of
necessaries
for
housekeeping
and
habit
from
some
gentlewoman
or
other
that
its
left
to
by
the
decease
of
some
friend
insomuch
that
the
wife
through
the
niggardliness
of
her
husband
imbezles
away
and
buies
more
then
otherwise
she
would
do
making
it
all
her
delight
and
sole
pleasure
to
blind
fold
her
peep
in
the
pot
as
she
calls
him
although
she
by
these
waies
and
means
doth
jestingly
consume
her
own
self
but
this
belongs
also
to
the
pleasures
of
marriage
and
if
it
in
the
conclusion
prove
to
be
a
pain
patience
is
the
best
remedy
but
be
merry
o
new
married
couple
that
you
like
unto
young
have
found
out
the
remedy
how
to
drive
away
this
of
your
wedlock
by
living
in
love
and
tranquility
equally
confiding
in
each
other
desiring
no
superiority
but
with
a
true
cordiality
interchangeably
granting
and
having
each
alike
freedom
of
the
monies
the
husband
hath
the
keeping
and
government
of
the
keys
and
the
wife
wants
for
no
mony
nay
hath
access
also
her
self
to
it
who
can
doubt
but
that
your
family
will
be
blest
and
your
stock
of
monies
increase
and
that
so
much
the
more
because
the
husband
hates
playing
at
tables
and
the
wife
is
an
enemy
to
cards
which
hath
been
the
occasion
ofttimes
on
both
sides
of
the
consuming
much
mony
and
therefore
is
little
used
by
some
shopkeepers
leaving
that
to
gentlemen
to
lose
both
time
and
mony
who
therein
seek
their
pastime
delight
and
pleasure
and
this
is
in
like
manner
imitated
by
many
great
ladies
who
are
often
so
cruelly
addicted
to
that
they
somtimes
value
not
in
one
evening
the
losing
of
very
great
sums
and
yet
know
how
to
maintain
their
respects
therein
very
prudently
and
gallantly
but
in
the
mean
while
let
the
millaner
tailor
and
shoemaker
run
most
miserably
and
shamefully
after
them
for
moneys
from
one
month
to
another
ofttimes
from
one
year
to
another
as
if
they
came
begging
to
them
for
a
peece
of
bread
and
when
they
do
pay
them
it
must
not
be
taken
notice
of
by
their
lords
and
husbands
these
generally
use
the
greatest
violence
against
the
peace
of
the
family
because
this
superfluous
expence
and
liberal
disposition
of
my
lady
is
very
seldom
pleasing
to
my
lord
who
little
thought
that
her
ladiship
would
have
been
such
a
of
the
cash
but
since
great
lords
as
well
as
other
meaner
sorts
of
persons
are
shot
and
pierc
by
one
and
the
same
blind
cupid
they
are
in
like
manner
subject
to
such
casualities
of
adversities
and
pleasures
and
every
one
perceives
when
it
is
too
late
what
kind
of
election
he
hath
made
just
as
they
do
who
begin
a
war
but
before
its
half
finished
are
weary
of
it
therefore
battel
be
ye
slow
but
slower
be
to
wed
for
many
do
repent
untill
that
they
be
dead
but
if
avoided
then
by
you
it
can
not
be
a
thousand
counsellors
will
well
deserve
your
illustration
by
the
navarre
society
the
fifth
pleasure
mens
negligence
of
their
affairs
whereby
their
and
loss
of
time
is
verily
the
women
being
the
weakest
vessels
are
many
times
most
cruelly
impeacht
when
the
sails
not
well
before
wind
and
tide
just
as
if
they
to
whom
is
only
given
the
charge
of
the
family
care
of
the
kitchin
and
nourishment
of
the
children
were
the
occasioners
of
sad
casualities
and
disasters
in
the
merchandizes
and
when
on
the
contrary
the
negligence
of
the
men
is
many
times
so
great
that
if
the
woman
knew
not
how
to
carry
her
self
like
a
prudent
it
would
be
impossible
ever
to
bring
the
ship
to
a
safe
harbour
and
to
free
it
from
shipwrack
but
all
things
must
run
to
a
total
destruction
many
men
are
free
hereof
who
are
continually
using
their
utmost
indeavours
and
take
their
chiefest
delight
in
the
promotion
of
their
affairs
by
day
with
their
bodies
and
at
night
with
their
sences
are
earnestly
busie
in
contriving
them
it
whose
main
aim
is
to
live
honestly
to
get
a
good
name
to
shew
good
examples
to
their
children
and
servants
to
leave
somthing
to
their
widows
and
never
to
be
a
or
derision
to
their
enemies
and
this
manner
of
diligence
makes
no
labour
irksom
no
morning
too
early
nor
no
evening
too
late
for
them
but
others
on
the
contrary
are
so
easie
humoured
and
so
negligent
of
their
vocation
that
they
think
its
much
below
the
respect
of
a
man
to
be
seen
whole
daies
in
their
houses
with
their
wives
and
about
their
affairs
then
in
such
cases
there
must
by
every
one
in
his
calling
be
found
a
multitude
of
lame
excuses
before
they
can
blind
the
eys
of
a
woman
or
pin
it
upon
her
so
far
that
she
perceives
not
he
seeks
his
pleasure
from
her
in
whom
his
whole
delight
ought
to
be
if
it
be
of
he
forsooth
hath
no
time
to
study
because
he
must
go
to
visit
a
patient
that
hath
a
violent
ague
to
see
what
operation
the
cordial
hath
done
which
he
ordered
him
to
take
yesternight
for
if
any
thing
else
should
come
to
it
he
would
certainly
be
a
dead
man
and
if
you
do
but
trace
his
paths
and
patient
it
is
by
his
friend
who
yesternight
was
troubled
with
a
vehement
and
at
the
very
last
before
he
went
to
sleep
took
in
a
swinging
bowl
of
strong
liquor
which
made
his
pulse
beat
so
feaverish
and
disorderly
the
next
morning
that
he
was
necessitated
at
one
draught
to
whip
off
a
lusty
glass
of
an
excellent
remedy
for
the
ague
and
then
to
walk
an
hour
or
two
upon
it
wherein
the
doctor
accompanying
him
it
causes
the
better
operation
here
now
you
see
the
doctor
and
what
ague
the
patient
hath
what
he
takes
what
comes
to
it
and
how
dead
a
man
he
is
truly
the
doctor
hath
made
as
neat
a
guess
at
it
as
if
he
had
studied
long
for
it
hang
the
books
when
a
man
hath
his
art
so
perfect
in
his
pate
for
this
the
doctor
hath
so
much
good
again
when
he
hath
a
mind
to
visit
a
patient
in
or
jameses
square
this
patient
walks
along
with
him
for
company
and
when
one
hand
washes
the
other
in
this
manner
o
then
they
are
both
so
silver
clean
turn
you
about
now
to
the
and
see
how
their
studies
are
all
on
fire
only
to
be
going
too
and
again
from
one
court
to
another
to
hear
forsooth
this
or
cause
pleaded
that
mightily
concerns
them
thereby
to
take
their
measures
accordingly
when
to
the
contrary
it
serves
to
no
other
purpose
then
to
sell
a
parcel
of
chatwood
and
tatle
tales
of
some
brave
practitioners
a
great
deal
worse
then
women
would
do
and
finally
to
appoint
a
place
where
in
the
evening
they
may
accompany
their
fraternity
at
a
good
glas
of
wine
under
this
bundle
resorts
continually
the
shittlecock
excisemen
accompanied
with
collectors
and
promooters
who
are
the
greatest
bellringers
in
taverns
and
somtimes
in
one
evening
spend
as
much
in
rhenish
wine
oisters
and
tobacco
as
ten
sufficient
families
would
do
in
a
month
these
live
without
care
and
command
freely
out
of
a
full
purse
imagining
in
themselves
that
all
the
revenues
are
their
own
and
if
their
wives
do
in
the
least
but
peep
into
their
concerns
they
presently
baptize
it
with
the
name
of
going
upon
an
exploit
to
chase
a
fat
doe
or
neatly
to
attrap
some
defrauder
and
that
this
part
may
have
the
better
gloss
when
they
come
home
in
the
morning
they
have
their
pockets
full
of
mony
which
they
throw
into
their
wives
laps
and
tell
them
that
they
have
attrapped
some
body
and
agreed
with
them
for
a
great
sum
of
mony
having
in
part
of
paiment
received
this
when
to
the
contrary
it
is
all
the
king
and
countries
mony
only
taken
out
of
their
offices
this
generally
lasts
so
long
till
they
are
pursued
by
the
treasurer
and
are
arrested
and
clapt
up
or
that
they
prevent
it
by
playing
bankrupt
and
in
this
manner
leave
a
sorrowfull
widow
and
children
behind
them
by
these
the
foolwise
for
the
most
part
join
themselves
making
their
wives
beleeve
that
they
are
sent
for
into
this
or
alehouse
or
tavern
about
an
business
or
to
write
a
will
or
a
contract
of
agreement
of
merchandize
though
it
be
to
no
other
end
or
purpose
then
to
have
a
perfect
knowledge
who
plaies
best
at
ticktack
irish
backgammon
passage
or
from
thence
then
they
can
not
come
before
it
be
late
in
the
night
and
have
learnt
there
to
make
a
scotch
will
so
wel
that
they
are
by
two
witnesses
half
carried
and
half
trail
home
to
their
houses
bragging
still
that
they
have
had
wine
and
beer
and
received
mony
into
the
bargain
thus
all
things
is
baptized
with
the
name
of
having
earnest
business
the
like
knowledge
have
also
the
and
others
who
love
company
to
alledge
for
their
excuses
and
defence
but
the
most
fashionable
give
it
the
name
of
going
to
a
sale
of
some
lands
and
houses
parts
of
ships
merchandizes
meetings
or
arbitrations
though
many
times
in
more
then
a
month
there
hath
not
been
the
least
sale
of
any
of
the
aforenamed
commodities
or
occasion
for
any
such
sort
of
businesses
and
verily
whom
do
you
see
sooner
or
later
at
the
exchange
then
these
sort
of
people
and
is
no
wonder
for
since
they
indeavour
not
to
have
the
name
of
their
principallest
aim
is
to
obtain
the
name
of
and
that
hath
so
much
in
it
that
it
requires
a
person
free
from
all
affairs
and
business
to
be
imploied
therein
here
you
may
perceive
them
to
be
the
most
diligent
of
all
others
oftner
inquiring
what
tidings
there
are
in
the
french
english
and
flanders
letters
then
to
know
what
news
from
the
seas
concerning
the
arrivall
or
loss
of
ships
or
what
merchandizes
commodities
and
wares
are
risen
or
fallen
in
price
nevertheless
these
make
the
greatest
bawling
and
scolding
at
their
wives
if
they
have
not
their
dinners
made
ready
for
them
precisely
an
hour
before
just
as
if
the
main
weight
of
all
the
traffick
and
negotiation
at
change
lay
upon
their
shoulders
though
it
only
tends
to
follow
the
train
and
to
hear
some
news
or
to
seek
some
these
blades
will
be
sure
also
in
the
winter
time
by
four
and
in
the
summer
time
by
six
a
clock
in
the
evening
to
be
precisely
at
the
where
under
the
taking
of
a
pipe
of
pure
spanish
tobacco
some
dishes
of
coffe
chocolate
sherbate
or
limonado
there
is
a
relation
made
of
the
newest
tidings
or
what
is
most
remarkable
of
things
that
have
hapned
here
or
there
they
hear
there
no
clock
strike
nor
think
upon
wives
children
or
servants
though
it
were
never
so
late
there
another
sort
of
men
that
do
not
frequent
the
exchange
and
go
out
only
about
their
shop
affairs
these
we
see
taking
their
pleasures
for
several
hours
together
at
queenhithe
and
other
places
with
selling
of
chatwood
and
when
they
are
a
weary
with
walking
and
talking
away
they
go
to
the
plume
of
feathers
to
rest
themselves
and
call
for
half
a
pint
or
a
pint
of
sack
and
some
to
the
strong
water
shop
and
drink
a
quartern
of
cinamon
water
or
aqua
mirabilis
and
these
imagine
themselves
to
be
of
the
most
orderly
sort
by
reason
that
some
men
in
the
summer
time
take
their
pleasure
most
part
of
the
morning
to
be
busie
at
their
wormwood
wine
and
consume
their
afternoon
in
clashing
and
quafing
off
the
bottels
of
old
hock
and
and
when
it
grows
cold
and
the
daies
short
then
they
are
early
at
the
shop
and
in
the
evening
late
in
the
and
again
twice
or
thrice
a
week
precisely
and
that
more
devouter
then
once
in
a
church
they
are
most
certain
to
be
found
at
the
playhouses
whilest
others
again
are
earnestly
imploied
in
taking
their
pleasures
in
a
coach
or
on
horseback
ambling
trotting
and
gallopping
along
the
high
ways
from
one
country
fair
or
horsemarket
to
another
and
at
every
place
where
they
see
but
a
conveniency
to
stable
their
horses
there
they
are
certain
to
bait
and
consume
an
infinite
deal
of
time
especially
if
they
happen
to
find
any
there
to
be
chatting
and
chaffering
with
these
are
much
like
unto
those
that
take
delight
in
and
barges
who
with
the
smallest
gale
of
wind
are
stormed
out
of
all
their
occupations
nay
although
they
were
never
so
important
yet
the
very
breathing
of
a
warm
zephyr
blows
not
only
all
business
out
of
their
heads
but
themselves
in
person
out
of
their
shops
and
here
you
may
behold
them
with
unwearied
bodies
rigging
of
their
masts
spreading
of
their
sails
hailing
up
their
spreet
and
leeboards
and
all
in
a
sweat
catching
hold
of
the
oars
to
be
rowing
whilest
at
home
they
are
too
weak
or
lazy
to
move
or
stir
the
least
thing
in
the
world
nay
can
hardly
bring
pen
to
paper
for
to
neglect
such
a
gallant
and
pleasant
day
of
weather
would
be
a
crime
unpardonable
lover
of
a
boat
may
stay
within
a
port
though
shop
and
office
both
should
dearly
suffer
others
again
are
sworn
pigeon
merchants
and
every
market
day
in
the
forenoon
precisely
let
it
cost
what
it
will
must
be
attending
there
and
the
rest
of
the
week
both
morning
and
afternoon
at
their
here
in
they
take
an
infinite
pleasure
hushing
up
their
pigeons
to
flight
then
observing
the
course
they
take
looking
upon
the
turning
of
their
tumblers
and
then
to
the
very
utmost
commending
the
actions
carriages
and
colours
of
their
great
runts
small
runts
carriers
light
horsemen
barberies
croppers
shakers
and
jacopins
taking
care
and
making
so
much
provision
for
their
young
ones
that
they
let
both
their
own
young
and
the
run
to
destruction
but
there
are
the
surpass
these
abundantly
who
upon
certain
penalties
must
at
the
least
thrice
a
week
appear
in
the
and
there
before
the
battel
begins
consume
two
or
three
hours
at
tables
and
in
wine
beer
and
tobacco
whilest
they
attend
there
the
coming
of
their
adversaries
and
other
lovers
of
the
sport
here
then
a
view
must
be
taken
of
each
others
cocks
which
are
forsooth
according
to
their
merits
and
value
set
apart
in
their
coops
either
in
the
yard
or
above
in
the
garret
to
be
fed
as
is
most
convenient
and
there
then
a
discourse
held
concerning
them
as
if
they
were
persons
of
some
extraordinary
state
quality
and
great
valour
not
a
word
must
be
spoke
as
much
as
if
there
were
a
penalty
imposed
upon
it
but
of
here
master
capon
vaunts
that
his
was
hard
enough
for
the
gallant
of
sir
john
boaster
although
sir
john
boasters
famous
but
three
weeks
before
had
fought
against
that
incomparable
of
squire
and
claw
him
off
severely
here
you
may
see
abundance
of
country
gentlemen
and
rich
farmers
coming
from
several
parts
with
their
cocks
in
their
bags
to
the
battel
hanging
them
up
there
in
ample
form
till
it
be
their
turns
to
fight
and
there
also
you
may
behold
lord
spendall
brought
thither
in
his
coach
very
magnificently
and
carried
home
in
no
less
state
but
seldom
goes
away
before
he
hath
either
won
or
lost
a
pretty
number
of
guinneys
yea
there
squire
clearpurse
with
his
princely
companion
who
keep
alwaies
six
and
thirty
at
nurse
by
the
master
of
the
pit
never
goes
away
from
thence
before
he
hath
got
by
his
ordinary
dunghill
cock
that
runs
about
the
streets
and
without
false
spurs
too
half
a
score
and
as
much
more
as
will
pay
his
reckoning
in
his
pocket
but
if
they
both
begin
to
appear
with
their
then
it
is
stand
clear
gentlemen
here
comes
the
honour
of
the
pit
and
then
the
master
of
the
pit
must
have
out
of
each
battel
for
sharpning
the
spurs
and
clipping
of
the
neck
feathers
half
a
ginny
and
then
when
the
battels
ended
he
brings
into
the
reckoning
half
a
crown
for
brandy
salve
and
cherishing
and
chafing
it
by
the
fire
but
for
this
they
have
the
honour
also
to
be
in
the
chamber
with
the
principallest
gentlemen
to
sit
in
the
best
places
of
the
pit
to
turn
the
and
like
prudent
aldermen
in
the
presence
of
all
the
auditors
to
give
their
judgements
touching
the
contending
parties
where
there
are
generally
more
consultations
advices
and
sentences
held
and
pronounced
then
are
to
be
found
or
heard
of
in
the
principallest
or
statutes
of
the
kingdom
it
would
be
here
an
everlasting
shame
if
the
conqueror
like
a
niggard
should
carry
all
this
mony
home
therefore
the
greatest
part
must
be
given
and
generously
spent
with
the
company
this
is
the
duty
of
every
one
whose
cock
hath
beaten
anothers
out
of
the
pit
and
went
away
crowing
like
a
conqueror
nay
what
matter
if
it
were
all
spent
its
no
such
great
peece
of
business
the
honours
more
worth
then
the
mony
in
the
mean
while
it
grows
late
in
the
night
and
the
good
woman
with
the
table
covered
sits
longing
telling
every
minute
and
hoping
for
the
coming
home
of
him
who
seems
to
find
and
take
more
pleasure
in
cockfighling
then
like
a
brave
himself
to
enter
into
the
pit
with
his
wife
o
most
contrary
and
miserable
pleasure
of
marriage
on
the
mens
side
but
amongst
these
i
am
of
opinion
there
none
hath
more
pleasure
then
the
master
of
the
pit
because
he
gets
more
for
the
feeding
clipping
salving
and
anointing
of
them
then
ten
good
nurses
and
put
them
all
together
and
moreover
he
hath
all
the
pleasure
for
nothing
and
is
mighty
observant
to
feed
and
tickle
their
fancies
and
obey
their
commands
that
their
delight
therein
may
the
more
and
more
increase
and
the
reckoning
also
be
a
whit
the
less
and
these
lovers
and
gentlemen
are
no
sooner
departed
but
he
laies
him
down
very
orderly
in
a
very
fashionable
bedstead
hung
round
about
the
curtains
and
vallians
with
suck
out
but
if
he
did
for
the
same
purpose
suck
out
all
the
it
would
be
a
much
more
rare
and
pleasant
sight
there
is
yet
another
sort
of
men
which
we
in
like
manner
find
that
consume
their
time
neglect
their
occasion
and
spend
their
mony
with
bull
and
as
the
do
with
one
way
that
they
take
pleasure
in
is
to
bring
their
dogs
together
and
there
fight
them
for
a
wager
of
five
or
ten
pound
and
somtimes
more
which
mony
must
be
set
or
stak
down
though
they
hardly
know
how
to
find
as
much
more
again
in
the
whole
world
and
there
the
poor
dogs
by
biting
and
tearing
one
anothers
skins
and
flesh
in
pieces
for
the
pleasure
of
their
fantastical
masters
and
if
the
wager
be
in
the
least
manner
to
be
contradicted
then
they
go
themselves
and
thump
and
knock
one
another
till
they
look
more
like
beasts
then
men
this
being
done
the
next
meeting
is
to
try
their
bear
and
at
the
bear
garden
the
match
being
made
all
their
wits
must
be
screw
up
to
the
highest
how
to
get
mony
to
make
good
their
wagers
though
wife
house
and
family
should
sink
in
the
mean
while
then
away
they
go
with
their
tousers
and
rousers
to
the
and
then
the
bull
being
first
brought
to
the
stake
the
challenger
lets
fly
at
her
and
the
bull
perceiving
the
dog
coming
slants
him
under
the
belly
with
her
horns
and
tosses
him
as
high
as
the
gallerys
this
is
much
laught
at
but
his
master
very
earnestly
and
tenderly
catching
him
in
the
fall
tries
him
the
second
time
when
he
comes
off
with
little
better
success
then
his
adversary
lets
loose
his
dog
at
the
bull
who
running
close
with
his
belly
to
the
ground
fastens
under
the
bulls
nose
by
the
skin
of
the
the
bull
shaking
and
roaring
to
get
him
loose
but
he
holds
faster
and
faster
then
up
flie
caps
and
hats
shouting
out
the
excessive
joy
that
there
is
for
this
most
noble
victory
now
comes
the
bear
dogs
being
stout
swinging
mastives
and
the
bearard
having
brought
the
bear
to
the
stake
unrings
him
and
turns
him
about
so
that
he
may
see
the
dog
that
to
play
at
him
the
challenger
lets
fly
his
dog
which
being
a
cruel
strong
cur
rises
up
to
the
bears
nose
fastens
and
turns
him
there
no
small
joy
and
an
eccho
of
shouts
that
makes
the
very
earth
tremble
then
there
pulling
and
hawling
to
get
him
off
from
the
bear
then
the
adversary
let
fly
his
dog
who
coming
to
fasten
the
bear
being
furious
and
angry
that
he
was
so
plagu
with
the
first
dog
claps
his
paw
about
the
back
of
him
and
squeezes
him
that
he
howls
and
runs
there
stands
the
master
looking
like
an
owl
in
an
ivybush
to
see
the
stakes
drawn
and
he
haply
with
never
a
penny
in
his
pocket
hath
no
mony
at
home
nor
knows
not
where
to
get
any
and
that
which
vexeth
him
worst
of
all
is
that
his
delicate
dog
is
utterly
spoil
but
leave
of
these
inhuman
and
brutal
stories
and
rather
relate
the
confession
of
another
sort
of
men
who
are
generally
of
a
longing
temper
not
much
unlike
to
the
weak
women
nay
sometimes
do
therein
far
surpas
the
women
and
altho
they
know
that
it
is
never
so
damagable
or
hurtfull
unto
them
yet
dare
boldly
say
women
long
it
harms
by
chance
but
mens
desire
a
worser
and
in
this
they
are
both
bold
and
shameless
clear
contrary
to
in
so
much
that
they
without
fear
or
terror
dare
at
noon
day
say
to
their
i
have
a
mighty
mind
to
a
pipe
of
tabacco
come
lets
go
to
the
sun
half
moon
or
to
the
golden
fleece
and
smoke
a
pipe
where
they
rip
up
such
a
multiplicity
of
discourse
and
consume
so
much
time
and
tabacco
that
if
they
tasted
neither
beer
nor
wine
they
might
with
all
reason
be
upbraided
to
be
persons
but
it
would
be
a
work
as
inexpressible
as
infinite
to
relate
their
longing
appetites
at
all
other
times
to
musmillions
seldry
anchovis
olives
or
slubbring
caviart
with
all
their
appurtenances
much
more
their
liquorishness
at
oisters
where
they
stand
greedily
swallowing
them
up
in
the
open
shops
not
giving
themselves
time
to
send
for
them
to
a
tavern
and
eat
them
decently
if
they
did
thus
in
the
presence
of
their
wives
they
might
have
some
pleasure
of
it
also
but
the
content
hereof
seems
to
consist
therein
that
either
alone
or
with
their
fraternity
they
may
thus
lustily
satisfie
their
longing
appetites
here
we
shall
commend
the
lovers
of
tee
because
they
are
willing
to
make
use
of
it
in
the
company
of
women
although
there
be
now
a
daies
so
much
formality
used
with
it
and
so
much
time
idly
spent
in
the
consumption
of
it
that
it
seems
almost
as
if
this
herb
were
found
out
or
brought
over
to
no
other
purpose
then
to
be
the
occasion
of
an
honest
between
men
and
women
where
you
may
have
intelligence
of
all
that
passes
betwixt
married
and
unmarried
persons
throughout
the
whole
city
and
wo
be
to
them
that
have
the
least
symptom
of
a
meazle
upon
their
tongue
for
the
true
lovers
of
tee
are
like
unto
the
suppers
up
of
coffy
and
are
the
best
for
all
things
that
happens
in
the
city
yea
almost
in
all
kingdoms
and
when
you
hear
the
men
speak
seriously
of
such
matters
it
is
as
if
they
had
the
best
correspondence
for
intelligence
out
of
all
princes
courts
but
especially
if
this
miracle
be
wrought
thereby
that
the
water
be
changed
in
to
wine
others
who
love
neither
tee
nor
coffy
and
yet
are
very
desirous
to
know
what
passes
in
the
world
you
may
find
mighty
earnestly
for
some
hours
stand
prating
in
the
booksellers
shops
alwaies
asking
what
news
is
there
what
pamphlets
what
pasquils
what
plays
what
libels
or
any
of
the
like
rubbish
is
lately
come
out
and
then
they
must
buy
and
read
them
let
it
cost
what
it
will
here
they
make
the
sole
balance
of
here
with
great
prudence
discourse
is
held
of
the
importantest
and
of
the
supreamest
persons
in
authority
and
in
their
own
imaginations
know
more
then
both
the
houses
of
lords
and
commons
although
they
never
sate
in
councel
with
any
of
their
footmen
nay
they
know
to
the
weight
of
an
ace
and
can
give
a
perfect
demonstration
of
it
which
of
the
three
governments
is
best
monarchy
anarchy
or
democracy
which
many
times
takes
such
a
deep
root
and
impression
upon
them
and
touches
them
so
to
the
very
heart
that
they
absolutely
forget
the
governing
of
their
needfull
affairs
which
they
went
out
about
for
when
they
come
to
the
place
where
their
occasions
lay
they
find
the
person
either
long
before
gone
abroad
or
so
imploied
with
his
own
business
that
he
can
hardly
a
quarter
do
that
he
ought
to
do
is
true
some
soft
natured
women
that
are
as
innocent
as
doves
observe
not
these
sort
of
actions
and
tricks
but
suffer
themselves
easily
to
be
fopt
off
by
their
husbands
or
else
by
a
gentle
salutation
are
appeased
but
others
who
are
cunninger
in
the
cares
of
their
shops
and
families
can
no
waies
take
a
view
of
these
doings
with
eys
of
pleasure
yet
this
is
nothing
near
the
worst
sort
and
is
naught
else
but
a
kind
of
a
scabbiness
that
the
most
accomplishedst
marriages
are
infected
with
and
verily
if
the
husbands
do
thus
neglect
their
times
and
their
wives
in
the
meanwhile
like
carefull
bees
are
diligent
in
looking
after
their
shop
and
housekeeping
they
ought
when
they
do
come
home
to
speak
their
minds
somthing
freely
to
them
but
the
imaginary
authority
of
men
many
times
surges
to
such
height
that
it
seems
to
them
insupportable
to
hear
any
thing
of
a
womans
contradiction
thinking
that
all
what
ever
they
do
is
absolutely
perfect
and
uncontrolable
and
can
on
the
contrary
when
their
wives
go
to
the
shambles
or
market
reckon
to
a
minute
in
what
time
they
ought
to
be
back
again
and
wo
be
to
them
if
they
do
according
to
the
nature
of
women
stand
and
prattle
here
or
there
their
time
away
concerning
laces
cookery
and
other
houshold
occasions
but
you
o
wel
married
couple
how
pleasant
it
is
to
see
that
you
two
agree
so
well
together
that
either
is
alike
diligent
and
earnest
in
taking
care
of
their
charge
that
your
husband
many
times
saith
unto
you
his
houswife
my
dear
it
is
a
curious
fair
day
go
walk
abroad
and
give
a
visit
to
some
or
other
of
your
good
acquaintance
i
shall
tarry
at
home
the
whole
day
and
will
take
sufficient
care
of
all
things
and
in
the
evening
come
and
fetch
you
home
and
you
again
in
like
manner
upon
a
good
occasion
releeve
your
husband
and
take
delight
in
his
walking
abroad
with
some
good
friends
to
take
his
pleasure
and
to
recreate
and
refresh
his
tired
sences
if
he
be
a
little
sickish
of
that
distemper
and
that
he
will
somtimes
spend
a
penny
upon
a
libel
or
new
tiding
that
is
a
great
pleasure
for
you
because
you
know
that
the
booksellers
and
printers
must
live
and
every
fool
must
have
one
or
bawble
to
play
with
you
had
great
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
if
he
consumed
his
mony
in
the
tavern
or
with
tables
but
you
know
that
ben
johnsons
poems
and
pembrooks
arcadia
did
so
inchant
you
that
they
the
mony
out
of
your
pocket
yet
they
serv
you
in
your
maiden
estate
with
very
good
instructions
and
shewing
you
many
vertues
you
may
therefore
think
that
such
men
who
desire
to
surge
higher
in
knowledge
will
have
somthing
also
to
be
reading
and
it
is
most
certain
whilest
they
are
busie
with
that
their
wives
are
free
from
being
controled
is
also
undeniable
that
men
can
not
alwaies
be
alike
earnest
in
their
affairs
for
verily
if
they
be
so
they
are
for
the
most
part
great
in
the
and
directers
of
their
wives
who
have
certainly
their
imperfections
and
it
is
the
principallest
satisfaction
and
greatest
pleasure
in
marriage
when
a
woman
winks
or
passes
by
the
actions
of
her
husband
and
the
husband
in
like
manner
the
actions
of
his
wife
for
if
that
were
not
so
how
should
they
now
and
then
in
passing
by
throw
a
at
one
another
or
how
should
they
at
night
be
so
earnest
in
pressing
one
another
to
go
first
to
bed
is
therefore
above
all
things
very
needfull
for
the
increasing
of
love
that
a
woman
wink
at
many
of
her
husbands
actions
especially
if
he
keep
no
correspondence
with
tiplers
that
will
be
alwaies
in
the
alehouses
and
there
too
will
be
serv
and
waited
upon
forsooth
to
a
hairs
breadth
nay
and
as
we
perceive
if
the
wife
brings
in
the
anchovis
upon
the
table
without
watring
them
a
little
as
oftimes
happens
there
then
the
house
is
full
of
hell
and
damnation
for
these
smaller
sort
of
gentlemen
are
they
who
sow
strife
and
sedition
between
man
and
wife
and
continually
talk
of
new
taverns
and
alehouses
clean
pots
and
the
best
wine
they
alwaies
know
where
there
is
an
oxhead
newly
broach
and
the
first
word
they
speak
as
soon
as
they
come
together
is
well
sir
where
were
you
yesternight
that
we
saw
you
not
at
our
ordinary
meeting
place
ho
saies
the
was
at
the
where
i
drunk
the
delicatest
wine
that
ever
my
lips
tasted
you
never
tasted
the
like
o
if
i
should
live
a
thousand
year
the
tast
would
never
be
out
of
my
thoughts
nay
if
the
gods
do
yet
drink
nectar
it
is
certainly
prest
out
of
those
grapes
words
can
not
possibly
decipher
or
express
the
tast
though
himself
the
father
of
eloquence
having
drunk
of
it
would
make
the
oration
what
do
you
think
then
if
you
and
i
went
thither
immediately
and
drunk
one
pint
of
it
standing
i
am
sure
sir
that
you
will
as
well
as
i
admire
it
above
all
others
done
it
is
and
away
they
go
but
it
is
not
long
before
you
see
those
roses
blossoming
in
their
hands
of
whose
smell
tast
and
colour
a
neat
draught
is
taken
and
an
excellent
exposition
of
the
qualities
yet
the
gentleman
commends
it
to
the
highest
though
he
is
assured
that
he
tasted
a
glass
in
master
cellar
that
was
far
delicater
and
that
he
would
far
esteem
beyond
this
nevertheless
he
acknowledges
this
to
be
very
good
but
the
pint
being
out
the
first
word
is
what
goes
upon
one
leg
draws
pint
of
the
same
and
then
they
begin
to
find
that
the
longer
they
drink
the
better
it
tasts
which
is
an
undeniable
sign
that
it
is
pure
good
wine
and
this
pint
being
out
again
presently
saies
the
good
things
consist
in
three
so
that
we
must
have
the
pint
where
upon
the
second
saith
as
soon
as
this
is
out
we
will
go
with
the
relish
of
it
in
our
mouths
to
master
clean
pints
to
tast
his
and
this
against
each
other
i
am
contented
so
said
so
done
and
thus
by
the
oftentimes
tasting
and
retasting
they
grow
so
mighty
loving
that
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
depart
from
one
another
because
they
every
foot
say
they
can
not
part
with
an
empty
pot
and
this
love
in
a
few
hours
grows
on
so
hot
that
the
love
of
the
wife
is
totally
squencht
not
only
drawing
men
mightily
out
of
their
business
but
keeping
them
late
out
from
their
families
and
making
them
like
incarnate
divels
against
their
wives
from
whence
proceeds
that
when
they
come
either
whole
or
half
drunk
home
there
is
nothing
well
to
their
minds
but
they
will
find
one
thing
or
another
to
controul
bawl
or
chide
with
to
these
also
may
be
adjoined
those
who
generally
resort
to
the
miter
kings
arms
and
plume
of
feathers
or
some
other
places
where
they
commonly
make
their
bargains
for
buying
and
selling
of
goods
and
merchandizes
from
whence
they
seldom
come
before
they
have
spent
a
large
reckoning
and
lost
more
then
three
of
their
five
sences
thinking
themselves
no
less
rich
then
they
are
wise
and
ly
then
very
subtlely
upon
the
catch
to
overreach
another
in
a
good
and
advantagious
bargain
by
which
means
they
themselves
are
somtimes
catcht
by
the
nose
with
a
mouldly
old
sort
of
unknown
commodity
that
they
may
walk
home
with
by
weeping
cross
and
next
morning
there
they
stand
and
look
as
if
they
had
suckt
their
dam
through
a
hurdle
and
know
not
which
way
to
turn
themselves
with
their
merchandize
they
have
made
in
this
manner
bringing
their
wives
and
children
if
they
let
them
know
it
into
excessive
inconveniences
and
for
all
this
want
for
nothing
of
grumbling
and
mumbling
sorts
of
men
are
tyrants
when
their
thirsty
souls
are
fill
they
scold
sore
hot
peep
in
th
pot
never
can
be
still
they
talk
and
at
such
a
rate
and
think
of
nought
but
evil
they
fight
and
brawl
and
wives
do
mawl
though
all
run
for
the
divel
but
at
their
draugh
they
quaff
and
laugh
amongst
their
fellow
creatures
they
swear
and
tear
and
never
fear
old
in
his
worst
features
who
would
but
say
then
by
the
way
that
woman
is
distressed
who
must
indure
an
epicure
with
whom
she
be
blessed
in
this
last
many
fathers
commit
great
errors
who
when
they
are
with
multiplicity
of
wine
take
little
regard
of
the
bad
examples
they
shew
unto
their
children
and
families
nay
some
there
are
that
will
in
their
sobrest
sence
go
with
their
sons
as
if
they
were
their
companions
into
a
tavern
without
making
any
sort
of
difference
and
also
when
there
is
a
necessity
or
occasion
for
it
know
but
very
slenderly
how
to
demonstrate
their
paternal
prudence
and
respect
but
in
this
manner
let
loose
the
bridle
of
government
over
their
children
thus
i
knew
an
understanding
father
do
who
with
some
other
gentlemen
and
his
son
being
upon
a
journy
together
to
take
care
of
some
important
affairs
but
seeing
that
at
every
inn
where
they
came
that
his
were
resolute
blades
and
that
he
must
pay
as
deep
to
his
son
as
himself
exhorted
his
son
to
take
his
full
share
of
all
things
and
especially
of
the
wine
every
foot
whispering
him
in
the
ear
peter
drink
and
then
after
a
little
while
again
peter
drink
and
as
he
recommended
this
so
earnestly
to
his
son
he
himself
very
diligently
lost
no
time
to
get
his
share
which
continued
so
long
that
going
out
of
the
chamber
for
their
necessities
they
both
fell
into
a
channel
where
clasping
each
other
in
the
arms
the
son
said
father
are
we
not
now
like
brothers
by
this
we
may
observe
what
the
father
of
a
family
by
his
examples
may
do
but
you
o
woman
have
no
need
to
fear
this
sort
of
president
in
your
husband
because
he
is
a
perfect
hater
of
excessive
drinking
and
an
enemy
to
such
company
that
alwaies
frequent
taverns
and
and
if
he
doth
go
once
among
good
acquaintance
and
take
a
glass
more
then
ordinary
which
is
but
seldom
there
nothing
that
he
doth
less
then
maunder
and
mumble
but
he
all
for
kissing
hugging
and
dallying
hating
to
the
highest
or
those
that
make
it
their
business
or
spend
their
times
in
the
summer
with
going
a
fishing
and
in
the
winter
go
a
birding
upon
which
sort
of
gentlemen
this
old
rime
was
made
in
the
winter
bird
and
summers
go
a
fishing
have
no
bad
meat
in
tub
that
is
not
worth
the
but
your
husband
on
the
contrary
takes
especial
care
of
his
affairs
and
for
the
pleasure
and
ease
of
his
wife
goes
himself
to
market
there
buies
a
good
joint
of
meat
or
a
fowl
and
gets
it
made
ready
and
sits
down
and
eats
it
with
his
beloved
then
when
he
and
you
have
very
relishingly
satisfied
your
appetites
and
drunk
two
or
three
glas
of
wine
into
the
bargain
he
invites
you
very
quietly
to
walk
up
stairs
into
your
chamber
to
say
a
well
who
could
wish
for
greater
pleasure
then
this
o
good
woman
how
happy
are
you
if
as
well
as
your
husband
you
can
keep
your
self
in
these
joys
and
delights
what
state
or
condition
is
there
in
this
world
that
may
be
compared
to
such
a
loving
friendly
and
well
accomplished
match
for
without
jesting
it
happens
hardly
once
in
a
thousand
times
that
a
match
falls
out
so
well
and
although
it
did
yet
it
is
not
free
from
a
thousand
crosses
and
dissatisfactions
which
are
done
unto
you
either
by
children
wicked
friends
or
somtimes
bad
neighbours
and
are
oftentimes
so
many
that
if
they
were
all
drawn
up
in
one
picture
we
should
in
good
truth
see
more
grief
and
horror
in
it
then
is
demonstrated
in
the
very
picture
of
hell
it
self
but
one
pound
of
the
hony
of
sweet
love
can
easily
balance
a
hundred
weight
of
that
terrible
and
bitter
wormwood
but
where
is
there
one
among
all
the
whole
number
of
tender
young
gentlewomen
who
being
incountred
by
an
airy
exquisite
lover
that
doth
not
start
back
with
a
thousand
troublesom
cogitations
and
beleeves
that
he
who
thus
earnestly
affects
her
is
at
the
least
possessed
with
one
of
these
terribly
evil
natures
nay
perhaps
with
some
what
else
as
a
pate
a
grumbling
gizzard
not
wel
in
his
sences
jealous
thoughts
or
the
actions
of
a
cotquean
are
his
companions
and
that
is
more
then
all
these
keeps
hid
a
certain
imbecility
in
his
defective
nature
which
is
no
waies
to
be
discovered
till
the
nuptial
rites
be
absolutely
celebrated
this
seems
to
be
a
great
occasion
and
reason
to
have
an
abhorrance
for
marrying
but
when
we
begin
again
with
serious
judgement
to
consider
the
weaknesses
strange
humors
and
deficiences
that
the
most
gaudiest
and
neatest
ladies
are
subject
to
experience
will
teach
us
that
they
are
cakes
bak
of
one
dough
and
fruits
of
one
tree
and
therefore
they
are
very
happy
if
two
of
one
mind
and
alike
natured
meet
together
but
if
two
of
contrary
humors
happen
together
there
is
nothing
to
be
expected
but
grief
sorrow
and
destruction
unless
it
happen
that
the
understanding
of
the
one
knows
extraordinarily
how
to
assist
the
weakness
of
the
other
by
somtimes
letting
loose
a
rope
and
then
drawing
it
in
again
whereby
they
may
the
prudentlier
sail
against
wind
and
tide
these
do
arrive
in
the
haven
of
the
pleasures
of
marriage
whereas
others
on
the
contrary
suffer
most
miserable
shipwrack
illustration
by
the
navarre
society
the
sixth
pleasure
woman
hath
got
the
breeches
what
mischeefes
arise
by
it
counsel
for
the
unmarried
to
shun
those
that
are
evil
under
a
thousand
pleasures
that
we
find
in
the
estate
of
marriage
it
is
none
of
the
least
to
see
the
woman
put
the
breeches
on
seeming
that
she
will
act
the
part
of
a
but
melancoly
men
oftentimes
can
not
bear
with
such
sort
of
jesting
and
presently
bawl
and
rail
at
such
a
woman
calling
her
a
monster
or
some
other
ill
name
although
they
know
very
well
that
such
sort
of
monsters
are
now
a
daies
so
common
that
if
they
were
all
to
be
shewn
in
booths
for
farthings
a
peece
there
would
be
less
spectators
then
there
was
to
see
the
sheep
with
five
legs
or
the
great
crocodile
verily
such
men
are
unhappy
and
they
do
not
a
little
also
neglect
these
pleasures
when
they
forsooth
think
that
by
the
putting
on
of
the
breeches
must
be
understood
that
they
are
over
lorded
and
that
the
hen
crows
louder
then
the
cock
o
miserable
man
if
your
head
be
possest
with
this
kind
of
frenzy
and
ca
be
removed
verily
if
you
had
but
seen
the
plate
of
the
women
fighting
for
the
breeches
you
would
be
of
another
judgement
for
in
those
daies
the
man
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
them
if
he
could
but
get
the
lining
untorn
or
indamaged
for
he
saw
perfectly
that
the
world
was
at
that
time
so
full
of
those
pretty
beldams
that
there
was
begun
a
most
bloody
war
between
the
better
sort
of
gentlewomen
and
the
meaner
degree
of
women
for
the
gaining
of
the
breeches
wherein
ketels
and
pans
tongs
and
fireshovels
brooms
and
maps
were
all
beaten
out
of
fashion
and
it
may
very
well
be
thought
that
if
the
woman
had
put
them
on
at
first
and
so
have
helpt
him
to
have
kept
them
this
wonderfull
and
destructive
war
would
never
have
risen
to
that
fury
therefore
it
is
no
small
prudence
of
the
women
in
these
daies
who
are
descended
from
that
family
to
take
care
at
the
very
first
for
the
good
of
their
husbands
that
the
breeches
may
be
well
preserved
but
let
be
serious
and
pass
by
all
these
kind
of
waggeries
if
we
consider
the
husband
as
captain
and
the
wife
as
lieutenant
is
it
not
in
the
highest
degree
necessary
that
she
should
have
also
a
part
of
the
masculine
knowledge
and
authority
besides
women
must
be
silent
in
politick
and
why
should
not
they
have
somthing
to
say
in
those
places
where
they
are
houswives
we
see
certainly
that
the
men
for
the
most
part
can
not
tarry
at
home
and
will
be
going
hither
or
thither
to
take
the
air
or
for
his
pleasure
or
to
smoke
a
pipe
of
tabacco
as
is
shew
you
in
the
fifth
confession
if
then
in
the
mean
while
the
woman
through
occasion
of
some
customers
in
the
shop
or
in
the
government
of
the
men
and
should
not
in
some
measure
shew
that
she
had
in
part
the
breeches
on
and
that
she
could
in
the
absence
of
her
captain
take
care
of
his
command
how
is
it
possible
that
the
trading
should
be
kept
in
order
and
the
children
and
servants
well
governed
i
will
not
so
much
as
mention
that
there
are
several
men
who
are
so
and
so
excessive
careless
that
if
they
had
not
had
the
good
fortunes
to
get
notable
young
women
to
their
wives
they
of
themselves
would
have
been
quickly
out
of
breath
and
might
now
perhaps
be
found
in
the
barbado
or
bermoodo
planting
tabacco
o
stout
amazonians
who
thus
couragiously
take
the
weapons
in
hand
to
defend
and
protect
your
husbands
children
servants
and
houskeeping
why
should
not
you
have
as
great
commendations
given
you
as
those
noble
souls
of
your
sex
had
in
former
times
and
who
would
not
rather
ingage
in
the
imbracing
of
you
then
any
waies
to
affront
or
bespatter
you
i
know
wel
enough
there
will
come
some
times
a
whiffling
blade
that
will
be
relating
one
or
other
story
how
like
a
drunken
nabal
he
was
well
instructed
by
his
prudent
and
diligent
wife
and
how
little
that
he
would
obey
or
listen
to
the
commands
of
so
brave
a
captain
but
they
will
very
seldom
or
never
say
any
thing
what
grounds
or
provocatives
they
have
given
her
for
so
doing
nevertheless
my
intent
is
not
so
much
to
flatter
the
evil
or
bad
natured
women
as
if
their
throwing
out
their
ire
upon
their
husbands
had
alwaies
a
lawfull
excuse
or
cause
just
as
xantippe
did
who
was
socrates
wife
think
that
she
had
reason
enough
on
her
side
to
scold
brawl
at
and
abuse
that
wise
and
good
natured
philosopher
and
to
dash
him
in
the
face
with
a
whole
stream
of
her
hot
marish
piss
or
that
it
did
any
waies
become
that
whorish
faustina
to
govern
that
sage
and
understanding
emperor
marcus
aurelius
by
no
means
for
then
that
and
high
minded
sex
would
prick
up
their
so
much
the
higher
but
happy
would
all
these
houswives
be
if
they
had
such
tutors
to
their
husbands
as
aurelius
was
is
most
certain
that
then
that
corrupt
seed
would
be
cropt
in
the
very
bud
and
not
be
suffered
to
come
to
perfection
yet
you
new
married
couple
are
both
in
heart
and
mind
concordant
and
all
your
delight
is
to
please
each
others
fancy
you
have
no
difference
about
the
supremacy
for
the
authority
of
the
one
is
alwaies
submitted
to
the
other
and
so
much
the
more
because
your
husband
never
commands
you
as
if
you
were
a
maid
but
with
the
sweetest
and
kindest
expressions
saith
my
dearest
will
you
bid
the
maid
draw
a
glass
of
beer
or
wine
or
do
this
or
that
oh
if
you
could
but
both
keep
your
selves
in
this
state
and
posture
how
happily
and
exemplarily
would
you
live
in
this
world
but
it
happens
many
times
that
the
women
through
length
of
time
do
take
upon
them
and
grow
to
be
so
free
that
they
will
be
solely
and
totally
master
and
if
their
husbands
through
have
given
them
a
little
more
then
ordinary
liberty
they
will
have
the
last
word
in
spight
of
fate
so
have
i
seen
one
who
could
by
no
means
keep
her
self
in
that
first
and
life
who
observing
her
husbands
good
nature
thought
her
self
wise
enough
to
govern
all
things
and
to
bring
him
to
her
bow
which
by
degrees
to
his
great
discontent
did
more
and
more
increase
in
matters
of
the
housekeeping
but
it
hapned
once
that
the
good
man
went
to
the
market
and
having
bought
a
delicate
capon
meets
with
a
friend
whom
he
invited
to
be
his
guest
and
going
home
with
it
his
wife
powts
maunders
and
mutters
and
looks
so
sowr
that
the
guest
saw
well
enough
how
welcome
he
should
be
the
good
man
with
fair
and
kind
words
sought
to
remove
this
which
was
in
some
measure
done
but
a
pretty
while
after
the
goodman
being
in
the
market
buies
a
couple
of
delicate
pullets
and
sends
them
home
with
a
porter
but
the
wife
told
him
she
had
made
ready
somthing
else
and
had
no
need
of
them
therefore
let
him
say
what
he
would
made
him
bring
them
back
again
the
good
man
meeting
with
the
porter
and
perceiving
the
of
his
wife
sends
them
to
a
tavern
to
be
made
ready
and
gets
a
friend
or
two
along
with
him
to
dispatch
them
and
dript
them
very
gallantly
with
the
juice
of
grapes
at
this
when
he
came
home
his
wife
grin
scolded
and
bawl
yet
done
it
was
and
must
serve
her
for
a
future
example
and
she
on
the
contrary
persisting
in
her
ill
nature
made
a
for
the
ruine
of
her
self
and
family
because
he
afterwards
to
shun
his
wife
frequented
more
then
too
much
taverns
and
alehouses
and
gave
the
breeches
solely
to
his
wife
not
long
ago
just
in
the
like
manner
there
married
an
indifferent
handsom
gentlewoman
with
a
proper
handsom
honest
and
good
natured
gentleman
but
the
gentlewoman
imagining
her
self
to
be
as
wise
as
a
doctor
acted
the
part
of
a
domineerer
controuling
grumbling
and
chiding
at
all
whatsoever
he
did
insomuch
that
all
his
sweet
expressions
could
no
waies
allay
her
but
rather
augmented
her
rage
yea
insomuch
that
at
last
she
saluted
him
with
boxes
and
buffettings
but
he
seeing
that
no
reasons
or
perswasions
would
take
place
and
that
she
grew
the
longer
the
more
furious
locks
the
dore
to
and
catches
her
by
the
coif
instructing
her
with
such
a
feeling
sence
that
at
last
she
got
open
a
window
and
leaps
out
thereby
escaping
the
remaining
part
of
that
dance
away
she
flies
immediately
to
her
father
and
her
brother
but
they
very
well
knowing
her
obstinacy
both
denied
her
houseroom
yet
the
next
day
through
the
intercession
of
others
there
was
a
pacification
made
and
a
truce
concluded
on
which
did
not
long
continue
so
for
she
beginning
again
her
former
wicked
actions
made
him
run
to
the
tavern
there
to
allay
his
disturbed
sences
leaving
her
to
wear
the
breeches
but
now
they
are
rid
of
mony
credit
respect
and
every
thing
else
another
gentlewoman
of
late
daies
seeing
that
she
had
married
a
good
husband
that
was
not
guilty
of
any
vice
exercised
her
authority
and
wickedness
so
much
the
more
over
him
yea
so
far
that
in
the
presence
of
several
neighbors
she
oftentimes
knockt
thumpt
and
cudgelled
him
that
at
last
she
was
called
by
every
one
incarnate
but
he
after
some
years
of
suffering
this
martyrdom
hapning
to
dy
there
comes
another
lover
very
suddenly
to
cast
himself
away
upon
this
hellish
peece
of
flesh
but
she
had
of
him
being
a
just
punishment
such
a
beloved
that
he
thunderd
her
three
times
as
bad
about
as
she
did
her
first
husband
and
then
flew
pots
kans
and
glasses
ringling
and
gingling
along
the
flore
and
she
on
the
top
of
them
well
and
warm
covered
with
good
thumps
and
and
somtimes
traild
over
the
flore
by
the
hair
of
the
head
o
miserable
terrors
of
such
a
horrible
state
and
condition
who
can
but
shake
and
quiver
yea
with
fear
start
back
when
they
begin
to
feel
the
least
motion
to
the
same
in
their
bodies
and
so
much
the
more
because
that
we
see
that
this
present
world
is
so
mightily
replenished
with
such
numbers
of
monstrous
wicked
and
unhappy
women
who
hide
their
wickedness
and
ill
natures
under
their
powdered
locks
and
flattring
looks
and
like
a
camelion
in
their
maiden
estate
will
be
agreeable
to
all
things
that
are
propounded
to
them
but
being
married
they
abandon
all
rationality
make
their
own
passions
their
masters
and
can
not
understand
by
any
means
the
pleasures
of
their
husbands
though
they
certainly
know
and
have
daily
experience
that
there
is
nothing
under
the
sun
which
hath
a
bewitchinger
power
upon
the
hearts
of
their
husbands
then
the
friendliness
and
kind
compliance
of
their
wives
this
hath
in
ancient
times
done
a
thousand
wonders
and
is
as
yet
the
most
powerfull
to
drive
all
stuborn
and
humors
out
of
the
heads
of
men
and
can
lead
them
as
it
were
by
the
hand
in
to
the
paths
of
reason
equity
and
love
o
happy
women
who
in
this
manner
have
the
hearts
of
men
in
your
hands
and
can
bring
the
same
to
your
obedience
where
you
will
what
means
and
waies
ought
you
not
to
indeavour
by
dallyings
and
kind
actions
to
gain
the
same
on
your
side
you
certainly
know
that
the
main
butt
which
is
aim
at
by
all
mankind
is
to
pass
through
this
short
life
of
ours
with
pleasure
and
quietness
but
alas
what
life
what
rest
what
pleasure
can
he
possess
in
this
world
who
hath
hapned
upon
a
scolding
and
no
waies
friendly
wife
oh
if
all
lovers
knew
this
so
well
they
would
never
suffer
themselves
to
be
led
away
captive
by
the
jettish
eys
and
breasts
or
strangle
themselves
in
the
curled
locks
of
women
but
would
imbrace
their
kind
naturedness
to
be
the
surpassingest
beauty
but
the
carnal
desires
and
covetousness
of
mony
blindeth
the
eys
of
so
many
that
oftentimes
for
the
satisfaction
thereof
they
will
contrary
to
all
exhortations
run
headlong
and
cast
themselves
into
a
pit
of
infinite
horrors
and
vexations
of
spirit
chusing
rather
a
proud
finical
blockheaded
virgin
with
two
thousand
pound
then
a
mean
understanding
one
with
ten
thousand
vertues
this
was
that
which
the
prudent
king
lycurgus
sought
to
prevent
when
he
gave
out
his
commands
that
no
parents
should
give
any
portions
with
their
daughters
in
marriage
or
might
leave
them
any
thing
for
an
inheritance
because
he
would
not
have
them
to
be
desired
in
marriage
by
any
but
for
their
beauty
and
vertues
in
those
daies
the
vitious
remained
just
as
now
doth
the
poor
ones
most
of
them
unmarried
and
cast
aside
and
every
maid
was
hereby
spur
up
that
her
vertues
might
in
brightness
and
splendor
surpass
others
happy
are
you
o
father
of
the
family
who
without
the
least
thoughts
of
lycurgus
have
made
so
good
a
choice
and
have
gotten
a
wife
that
is
beautifull
rich
good
natured
and
vertuous
you
learnt
first
to
know
her
well
that
you
might
the
better
woe
her
and
so
be
happy
in
marriage
make
this
your
example
o
all
you
foolish
and
wandring
lovers
who
are
so
desirous
to
tast
of
the
pleasures
and
sweetness
of
marriage
and
are
somtimes
so
disquieted
and
troubled
till
you
cast
your
selves
upon
an
insulting
domineering
wife
who
perhaps
hath
the
breeches
already
on
and
will
vex
you
with
all
the
torments
imaginable
in
the
world
do
but
use
these
few
remedies
for
your
squandered
brains
and
be
assured
they
will
bring
you
to
have
good
fortune
and
tranquility
search
not
after
great
riches
but
for
one
of
your
own
degree
for
the
rich
are
insulting
and
proud
admire
no
outward
beauty
because
they
are
proud
of
their
beauty
and
imagine
themselves
to
be
goddesses
whom
their
husbands
ought
to
obey
shun
those
who
are
much
lesser
then
your
self
for
when
a
mean
one
finds
her
self
promoted
by
a
great
match
she
is
much
prouder
and
then
one
of
a
good
extraction
and
will
much
sooner
than
another
indeavour
to
domineer
over
her
husband
dissemble
not
in
your
wooing
for
dissimulation
deceives
its
own
master
be
not
too
hasty
for
a
thing
of
importance
must
be
long
and
prudently
considered
of
before
a
final
conclusion
can
be
made
follow
the
advice
of
understanding
friends
for
to
be
wise
and
in
love
was
not
given
to
the
gods
themselves
chuse
no
country
wench
for
want
a
whole
years
learning
before
know
how
to
shine
upon
a
house
or
office
and
two
years
to
learn
to
make
a
cursie
if
you
marry
arm
your
self
with
patience
for
he
that
hath
the
yoke
of
marriage
upon
his
shoulders
must
patiently
suffer
and
indure
all
the
disquiets
and
troubles
that
that
estate
is
subject
to
if
these
things
be
observed
by
you
innocent
and
wandring
lovers
they
will
much
assist
you
in
your
choice
but
not
preserve
you
from
being
a
slave
because
the
gentlewoman
whom
you
have
chosen
hath
till
this
time
be
past
had
one
or
other
ill
condition
which
she
knew
how
to
hide
and
dissemble
with
that
you
never
so
much
as
thought
of
or
expected
from
her
cornelius
agrippa
knew
this
in
his
daies
when
he
said
men
must
have
and
keep
their
wives
as
it
chanceth
if
they
be
saies
he
merry
humored
if
they
be
foolish
if
they
be
unmannerly
if
they
be
proud
if
they
be
sluttish
if
they
be
ugly
if
they
be
dishonest
or
whatsoever
vice
she
is
guilty
of
that
will
be
perceived
after
the
wedding
but
never
amended
be
therefore
very
vigilant
you
wandring
lovers
and
sell
not
your
liberty
at
so
low
a
price
which
can
not
be
redeemed
again
with
a
whole
sea
of
repentances
and
you
o
silent
gentlewomen
methinks
you
long
to
know
whether
there
be
no
remedies
for
you
to
be
had
that
you
may
also
be
as
well
against
the
rigid
natured
subtle
and
dissembling
lovers
as
well
as
they
have
against
the
vitious
gentlewomen
take
notice
that
since
you
have
subjected
your
selves
to
that
foolish
fashion
of
these
times
never
of
your
selves
to
go
a
wooing
but
with
patience
will
expect
who
will
come
for
you
that
rule
must
be
first
observed
and
regard
taken
of
him
that
cometh
then
it
is
the
time
to
consider
principally
whether
he
loveth
you
for
your
mony
or
for
your
beauty
inquire
whether
he
have
a
good
method
or
way
for
the
maintaining
of
a
family
for
if
he
have
not
that
to
build
upon
the
whole
foundation
will
tumble
search
also
whether
he
be
of
an
honest
rather
then
great
extraction
for
vertue
is
the
greatest
gentility
inquire
also
whether
he
be
a
frequenter
of
alehouses
especially
of
such
as
are
of
an
evill
reput
be
a
lover
of
such
houses
makes
him
to
think
of
other
if
he
be
covetous
of
honour
he
hath
several
other
vertues
hate
a
gamester
like
the
plague
for
they
are
consumers
of
all
nay
their
very
gain
is
loss
abhor
a
person
of
no
imploy
or
gadder
along
the
streets
for
they
are
fit
for
nothing
if
you
marry
shew
all
honour
respect
and
love
to
your
husband
indeavour
not
to
lordize
over
him
because
that
both
by
heaven
and
nature
is
given
unto
him
in
so
doing
you
will
have
as
well
as
our
couple
the
expectation
of
a
happy
match
which
though
it
falls
out
well
yet
is
subject
to
severall
accidental
corruptions
as
you
will
perceive
in
the
further
confession
of
the
insuing
pleasures
even
as
if
they
were
a
the
seventh
pleasure
bad
times
teaches
the
new
married
couple
makes
them
brave
housekeepers
they
take
in
lodgers
and
give
good
examples
to
their
it
was
formerly
very
pleasant
living
when
trading
and
merchandizing
flourished
so
nobly
that
every
evening
people
were
fain
to
carry
a
whole
drawer
full
of
mony
out
of
the
counter
in
to
the
and
then
the
good
woman
had
alwaies
two
or
three
hours
work
to
sort
it
before
they
could
so
much
as
think
of
going
to
bed
but
it
seems
that
destructive
war
as
being
a
scourge
from
heaven
for
our
dissatisfied
spirits
hath
so
lamentably
humbled
the
land
of
our
nativity
that
there
are
very
few
who
have
not
now
just
causes
enough
to
complain
and
you
o
young
people
shall
be
witnesses
hereof
who
have
already
in
that
short
time
that
you
have
been
married
experience
that
things
do
not
alwaies
run
upon
wheels
so
merrily
as
was
expected
is
true
you
possess
the
pleasure
of
an
indifferent
trade
as
well
as
the
rest
of
your
neighbours
but
it
is
not
in
any
measure
to
be
compared
with
those
golden
daies
that
your
ancestors
had
when
they
could
lay
up
so
much
wealth
and
yet
complained
they
had
but
little
custom
illustration
by
the
navarre
society
verily
when
i
rightly
consider
it
methinks
you
are
happier
then
they
were
for
at
that
time
all
their
delight
was
by
a
covetous
frugality
to
reap
much
riches
together
and
though
that
hapned
very
well
yet
there
was
never
enough
for
mony
is
no
impediment
to
a
covetous
soul
because
it
alwaies
yearns
for
more
but
now
on
the
contrary
it
is
esteemed
to
be
very
nobly
done
and
people
take
an
absolute
delight
in
it
if
they
can
but
tell
how
to
scrape
so
much
together
that
they
may
keep
the
dunners
from
their
dores
bring
up
their
children
indifferently
well
and
pay
the
taxations
and
impositions
that
are
imposed
upon
them
in
good
truth
they
that
can
do
this
now
are
worthy
of
as
much
credit
and
reputation
as
those
were
that
prospered
much
in
former
daies
and
their
pleasure
ought
not
to
be
lesser
then
the
others
before
was
o
happy
successors
who
through
the
contentment
of
your
minds
possess
now
as
great
pleasure
as
your
rich
parents
formerly
did
in
their
plentifull
daies
verily
your
gain
is
comparatively
better
then
theirs
because
you
are
satisfied
with
so
much
less
and
by
consequence
when
the
hour
of
death
approaches
you
can
so
much
the
easier
depart
from
this
world
by
reason
you
shall
not
leave
so
many
knives
behind
you
that
may
cut
your
childrens
throats
therefore
if
your
trading
should
come
to
diminish
more
and
that
you
can
hardly
tell
how
to
keep
both
ends
together
then
comfort
your
selves
with
this
happiness
to
the
end
that
the
pleasures
of
your
marriage
may
thereby
not
be
eclipsed
for
in
bad
times
you
must
as
diligently
search
after
the
pleasures
of
marriage
as
for
gain
and
good
trading
but
it
seems
as
you
imagine
that
this
pleasure
rather
decreases
then
increases
because
that
the
small
trading
is
accompanied
with
bad
paiment
and
where
ever
you
run
or
go
to
dun
you
find
no
body
at
home
but
return
back
to
your
house
with
empty
pockets
for
there
is
master
highmind
and
squire
spightfull
who
come
every
day
in
their
velvet
coats
to
the
change
are
not
in
the
least
ashamed
that
the
goods
which
they
bought
to
be
paid
ready
down
after
the
expiration
of
a
full
year
are
not
yet
paid
and
master
negligent
who
is
alwaies
in
an
alehouse
and
seldom
to
be
found
in
his
or
at
the
change
thinks
it
is
abundance
too
early
in
july
so
much
as
to
look
upon
the
reckoning
of
last
much
less
to
pay
it
nevertheless
others
have
their
creditors
also
and
this
bill
of
exchange
and
that
assignment
must
be
paid
at
their
due
times
yea
and
the
winter
is
approaching
wood
and
coals
must
be
bought
the
cellar
furnisht
with
beer
and
wine
and
some
firkins
of
butter
and
provision
made
for
the
to
be
filled
as
well
as
several
other
sorts
of
necessaries
for
the
family
that
will
be
wanting
insomuch
that
this
affords
but
a
very
slight
appearance
of
concluding
the
year
in
pleasure
but
o
carefull
house
father
if
you
knew
in
what
a
happy
age
you
live
you
would
not
go
away
so
dissatisfied
but
imbrace
all
these
affairs
very
joifully
for
extraordinary
pleasures
hitherto
you
have
gone
forward
like
one
young
and
unexperienced
and
have
meant
with
master
dolittle
alias
john
the
satisfied
that
things
were
to
be
done
with
kissing
licking
dallying
and
other
fidle
fadles
but
now
you
are
come
to
a
more
sober
serious
understanding
and
to
have
mans
knowledge
and
the
same
prudent
conduct
that
your
parents
and
friends
had
when
they
were
assembled
together
about
your
contract
of
marriage
and
then
thought
of
all
these
things
now
you
are
grown
to
be
a
master
of
arts
in
the
university
of
wedlock
and
great
juno
laught
that
venus
hath
so
long
hoodwink
you
come
on
then
these
films
being
now
fallen
from
your
eys
do
but
observe
how
prudent
carefull
time
hath
made
you
and
how
circumspect
and
diligent
you
begin
to
be
that
you
may
get
through
the
world
with
honour
commendations
and
good
respect
how
like
a
care
taking
father
you
are
now
providing
for
your
wife
children
and
whole
family
oh
if
your
father
and
mother
were
now
alive
how
would
they
rejoice
in
this
your
advancement
which
are
indeed
the
upright
pleasures
of
marriage
for
all
married
people
draw
the
cares
here
mentioned
along
with
them
though
they
come
with
a
bag
full
of
mony
about
their
necks
in
to
the
world
do
but
see
till
now
you
have
had
a
brave
and
splendant
house
paid
great
rent
only
for
your
self
and
family
to
live
in
now
you
begin
to
consider
with
understanding
and
pleasure
whether
a
dwelling
of
less
price
would
not
serve
as
well
in
which
you
might
have
a
chamber
or
two
that
you
could
let
out
to
some
civil
gentlemen
who
might
diet
with
you
it
would
help
to
pay
the
rent
and
bring
some
profit
in
besides
and
it
is
all
one
trouble
for
boiling
roasting
and
going
to
market
the
day
goes
about
nevertheless
and
the
maid
suits
her
work
accordingly
and
moreover
you
have
good
company
of
them
in
your
house
and
alwaies
either
one
or
another
at
dinner
begins
to
relate
some
kind
of
pretty
discourse
that
is
continually
very
pleasurable
and
delightfull
to
be
heard
observe
how
glad
your
wife
is
concerning
this
resolution
there
hath
not
been
these
three
years
any
proclamation
published
which
pleased
her
fancy
better
for
now
her
husband
will
have
some
pastime
and
good
company
at
home
so
that
he
needs
not
go
to
seek
it
in
the
evening
in
alehouses
or
other
places
well
who
can
not
but
see
here
how
one
may
learn
through
honest
time
and
experience
what
pleasures
they
are
accompanied
with
but
stay
a
little
and
to
be
serious
with
you
when
you
get
such
guests
see
how
they
will
plague
you
for
the
general
imaginations
of
such
gentlemen
are
that
all
the
monies
they
spend
is
pure
gain
and
that
the
landlord
and
landlady
alwaies
ought
to
provide
such
sort
of
diet
as
they
have
most
a
mind
to
and
though
it
be
never
so
well
drest
yet
there
shall
hardly
come
one
dish
to
the
table
but
they
will
be
finding
fault
that
this
hath
too
much
pepper
in
it
and
that
too
much
salt
besides
all
this
both
maids
and
men
and
all
what
in
the
house
must
be
at
their
commands
nay
be
readier
and
nimbler
to
serve
them
then
their
master
and
mistriss
and
that
more
you
are
deprived
of
the
whole
freedom
of
your
house
and
table
it
happens
also
many
times
that
they
have
so
many
visiters
and
runners
after
them
that
they
require
more
attendance
and
the
maid
hath
more
work
with
them
alone
then
the
whole
besides
this
is
the
general
course
of
all
fellow
commoners
i
will
not
say
any
thing
of
a
worser
sort
which
are
many
times
amongst
them
who
run
in
the
mornings
to
shops
and
in
the
afternoon
to
taverns
where
they
so
disguise
themselves
that
one
must
be
ashamed
for
honest
people
who
are
in
the
shop
or
standing
upon
the
flore
that
sees
them
either
come
in
a
dores
or
down
from
their
chambers
hardly
able
to
stand
besides
they
value
not
if
they
tarry
out
late
at
nights
and
if
it
be
possible
they
will
intice
the
good
man
of
the
house
to
debauch
with
them
and
then
again
they
are
seldom
free
from
private
chatting
and
pratling
with
the
maid
and
men
servants
but
perhaps
you
may
light
of
a
better
sort
which
time
who
is
the
mother
of
all
things
will
make
appear
let
it
be
as
it
will
here
is
alwaies
pleasure
and
delight
to
be
expected
for
the
good
man
because
the
good
woman
by
this
means
increaseth
to
more
knowledge
of
housholding
affairs
and
therefore
is
alwaies
busie
like
a
prudent
mother
in
educating
governing
and
instructing
her
children
yea
if
you
o
father
of
the
family
will
go
a
little
further
and
behold
with
clear
eys
how
far
your
wife
through
these
bad
times
is
advanced
in
understanding
and
knowledge
i
do
assure
you
you
will
find
your
self
as
ravisht
with
joy
because
this
is
as
great
a
transformation
as
ever
ovid
writ
of
for
whereas
at
the
beginning
of
your
marriage
all
her
cogitations
were
imploied
for
the
buying
of
large
venetian
indean
chainy
plush
stools
and
chairs
turkish
tapistry
rich
presses
and
tables
yea
and
whatsoever
else
was
needfull
for
neatness
and
gallantry
we
see
now
that
all
her
sences
are
at
work
where
ever
they
may
or
can
be
to
save
and
spare
all
things
and
to
take
care
that
there
may
not
so
much
as
a
match
negligently
be
thrown
away
formerly
your
good
wife
used
by
reason
of
her
youth
and
want
of
knowledge
to
walk
very
stately
hand
in
hand
with
you
along
the
streets
finically
trickt
up
with
powdered
locks
and
a
laced
gorget
and
gown
and
had
commonly
need
of
at
the
least
three
hours
time
before
she
with
the
help
of
two
serviceable
assistants
could
be
put
to
her
mind
in
her
dress
and
then
again
all
her
discourse
was
of
walking
or
riding
abroad
and
of
junketting
and
merriment
whereas
now
on
the
contrary
seeing
the
small
gain
she
is
sparing
of
all
things
and
ordring
it
to
the
best
advantage
for
the
family
without
so
much
as
setting
one
foot
out
of
her
house
or
counter
unnecessarily
never
thinking
more
of
gadding
abroad
to
take
pleasure
but
finds
all
her
delight
by
being
busie
in
her
houskeeping
amongst
her
children
and
servants
here
you
may
behold
her
driving
the
maid
forwards
and
setting
her
a
spinning
to
keep
the
sleep
out
of
her
eys
and
with
this
intent
also
that
she
may
have
the
delight
to
get
yarn
enough
ready
towards
winter
to
let
a
brave
web
of
linnen
be
woven
for
the
service
of
the
family
yea
and
here
she
shews
you
that
though
before
she
was
but
a
bartholomew
baby
that
she
is
now
grown
to
be
a
brave
houswife
and
that
if
need
requires
she
can
put
a
hand
to
the
plough
stoutly
o
happy
man
who
in
such
a
sad
and
troublesom
time
can
find
out
so
many
pleasures
of
marriage
and
who
art
already
so
well
instructed
in
that
most
illustrious
school
is
true
you
will
meet
with
some
jeering
that
will
say
is
this
that
brave
couple
that
there
was
such
a
noise
made
of
when
they
were
married
is
this
the
gentlewoman
that
used
to
go
so
costly
in
her
gorgets
and
gowns
goes
she
now
with
a
plain
wastcoat
alas
and
welladay
doth
her
feathers
begin
to
hang
thus
well
is
this
the
gentlewoman
that
used
alwaies
to
keep
two
maids
can
she
now
make
a
shift
with
a
little
wench
that
earns
her
wages
with
spinning
and
her
diet
with
doing
the
house
work
it
must
certainly
ly
very
nastily
and
sluttishly
at
her
house
is
very
true
this
might
happen
to
you
and
it
would
seem
to
eclipse
the
sun
of
your
pleasures
of
marriage
very
much
if
you
had
not
now
o
well
matcht
couple
through
the
instruction
of
the
winged
time
gotten
such
prudent
eys
that
you
can
easily
see
through
such
vain
and
simple
clouds
but
now
you
apprehend
to
your
great
joy
and
comfort
that
this
arrow
comes
out
of
the
quiver
of
such
as
are
indebted
to
every
body
and
suffer
themselves
daily
to
be
durrid
who
are
continually
pratling
with
the
neighbors
and
gadding
along
the
streets
they
take
notice
of
every
dore
that
opens
and
neglect
their
own
houskeeping
having
no
understanding
to
govern
it
the
dishes
pots
and
pans
are
alwaies
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
flore
and
benches
and
stools
are
all
covered
and
ly
filled
with
the
childrens
dirty
clouts
and
the
windows
are
so
thick
with
dirt
that
the
sun
can
hardly
shine
through
them
whose
first
word
is
when
any
body
comes
into
their
house
what
by
reason
of
these
sad
times
a
body
hath
neither
joy
nor
delight
in
their
houskeeping
if
we
wash
the
glass
windows
they
are
in
danger
of
breaking
and
at
present
we
can
not
bear
with
any
losses
and
these
ordinarily
have
more
pratling
and
felling
then
any
other
women
and
no
body
knows
any
thing
better
then
these
sworn
tittletattlers
they
are
seldom
to
be
found
with
a
upon
their
laps
and
are
the
occasion
that
their
houses
children
and
maids
stink
of
filth
and
sluttishness
with
their
cloaths
out
at
the
elbous
and
their
stockins
out
at
the
heels
whilest
their
husbands
sit
in
the
alehouses
and
seek
by
drinking
domineering
and
gaming
to
drive
these
damps
of
the
sad
times
out
of
theire
brains
which
continueth
so
long
till
that
all
is
consumed
and
they
both
fly
damnably
in
debt
to
their
creditors
well
then
you
worthy
and
faithfull
houskeepers
you
see
now
the
unhappy
state
and
condition
of
these
venomous
controulers
of
others
and
on
the
contrary
you
may
perceive
how
happy
the
bad
times
like
a
prudent
instructor
makes
you
what
a
quantity
of
understanding
and
delight
it
imparts
unto
you
whilest
you
both
with
joint
resolution
diligent
hands
and
vigilant
eys
indeavor
the
maintenance
and
setting
up
of
your
family
be
assured
that
this
care
and
frugality
will
so
root
it
self
in
your
very
bones
that
although
the
times
changed
and
grew
better
you
would
reserve
a
stedfast
delight
in
the
promoting
the
good
and
benefit
of
your
houskeeping
and
withall
leave
to
your
children
such
riches
and
good
examples
that
they
will
follow
your
footsteps
of
carefulness
with
delight
and
lay
a
hand
to
the
plough
thereby
to
demonstrate
that
they
were
of
a
good
extraction
which
if
it
so
happen
you
will
inherit
one
of
the
greatest
and
desiredst
pleasures
that
is
to
be
found
in
the
married
estate
illustration
by
the
navarre
society
the
eighth
pleasure
parents
would
bring
up
their
son
in
their
way
of
trade
but
he
hath
no
mind
he
is
put
to
school
out
of
the
city
grows
a
scholler
commits
much
mischief
is
apprehended
and
informed
what
a
schollerlike
life
uds
life
now
i
thinke
o
amongst
the
pleasures
of
mariage
this
is
none
of
the
least
when
one
sees
their
children
feed
well
and
grow
up
healthfully
and
merrily
and
their
stomacks
in
a
morning
are
as
soon
open
as
their
eys
then
at
noons
they
can
claw
it
away
at
a
good
dish
as
well
as
persons
of
full
growth
and
years
and
about
four
of
the
clock
their
appetites
are
again
prepared
for
an
afternoons
lunchion
insomuch
that
they
can
eat
you
into
poverty
without
making
their
teeth
bleed
o
it
is
such
a
delight
to
see
that
they
continually
grow
up
so
slovenly
and
wastfully
in
their
cloaths
that
they
must
needs
have
every
half
year
almost
a
new
suit
and
that
alwaies
a
little
bigger
whereby
the
father
sees
that
he
shall
in
short
time
have
a
son
to
be
his
man
in
the
shop
and
the
mother
a
daughter
to
be
her
caretakester
and
controulster
of
the
kitchin
thus
we
advance
in
the
estate
of
mariage
from
one
pleasure
to
another
o
how
happy
be
if
your
children
be
but
pliable
and
courteous
and
grow
up
in
obedience
and
according
to
your
example
but
we
see
in
the
generality
that
as
their
understanding
increases
that
also
their
own
wills
and
desires
do
in
like
manner
not
diminish
perhaps
you
meet
with
some
such
symptoms
as
these
are
in
your
own
son
for
having
been
some
years
learning
the
latine
tongue
at
pauls
or
merchant
tailors
school
he
is
then
inveagled
by
some
of
the
neighbors
sons
to
go
with
them
to
learn
the
italian
or
french
language
to
which
purpose
they
know
of
a
very
delicate
boarding
school
a
little
way
out
of
the
city
and
then
they
baptize
it
with
the
name
that
he
hath
such
a
longing
and
earnest
desire
to
learn
it
that
he
can
not
rest
in
the
night
for
it
what
will
you
do
the
charge
there
of
the
bad
times
and
the
necessity
you
have
for
him
at
home
makes
you
perswade
him
from
it
and
to
proffer
him
convenient
occasions
in
the
city
but
what
helps
it
the
fear
of
drawing
the
child
from
that
which
he
has
so
much
a
mind
to
and
may
be
that
also
wherein
his
whole
good
fortune
consists
causes
you
to
take
a
resolution
to
fullfill
his
desire
away
he
sent
then
and
agreed
for
and
then
there
must
be
a
trunk
furnisht
with
all
manner
of
linnen
and
cloaths
with
other
toys
and
sweet
meats
and
mony
in
his
pocket
to
boot
having
been
some
small
time
there
he
sends
some
letters
for
what
he
wants
which
is
with
recommendations
of
being
saving
and
diligent
sent
unto
him
and
it
is
no
small
pleasure
for
the
parents
if
they
do
but
see
that
he
is
an
indifferent
proficiant
all
their
delight
and
pleasure
is
when
time
will
permit
to
go
to
their
son
and
to
shew
him
their
great
love
and
affection
but
the
daughter
which
goes
along
with
her
mother
is
kindled
with
no
small
matter
of
jealousie
to
see
that
her
brother
puts
her
parents
to
so
much
charge
gets
what
he
pleases
and
that
their
minds
are
never
at
rest
about
him
when
she
on
the
contrary
being
at
home
is
thrust
by
her
mother
into
the
drudgery
of
the
house
or
kept
close
to
her
needle
yet
these
are
pacified
with
a
fine
lace
a
ring
or
some
such
sort
of
trinkom
trankoms
and
then
with
telling
them
into
the
bargain
when
your
brother
comes
home
he
shall
keep
the
shop
this
the
father
is
in
expectation
of
and
the
son
being
come
home
gives
a
great
pleasure
to
his
father
and
mother
by
reason
he
speaks
such
good
latin
and
italian
and
is
so
gentile
in
his
behaviour
but
to
look
to
the
shop
he
hath
no
mind
to
say
what
they
will
talk
is
but
talk
all
his
desire
and
mind
is
to
go
to
the
university
either
of
oxford
or
cambridge
and
although
the
father
in
some
measure
herein
yeelds
and
consents
the
mother
on
the
other
side
can
by
no
means
resolve
to
it
for
her
main
aim
was
that
her
son
should
be
brought
up
in
the
shop
because
that
in
the
absence
or
by
decease
of
her
husband
he
might
then
therein
be
helpfull
to
her
besides
that
it
is
yet
fresh
in
her
memory
that
when
her
brother
studied
at
oxford
what
a
divellish
deal
of
mony
it
cost
and
what
complaints
there
come
of
his
manner
of
living
insomuch
that
there
was
hardly
a
month
past
but
the
proctor
of
the
colledge
or
the
magistracy
of
the
city
must
have
one
or
other
penalty
paid
them
now
they
try
to
imploy
the
son
in
the
shop
who
delights
in
no
less
melody
then
the
tune
of
that
song
letting
slip
no
occasion
that
he
can
meet
with
to
get
out
of
the
shop
and
shew
himself
with
all
diligence
willing
to
be
a
labourer
in
the
tennis
court
or
at
the
bilyard
table
and
is
not
ashamed
if
there
be
hasty
work
in
the
evening
to
tarry
there
till
it
be
past
eleven
of
the
clock
what
a
pleasure
this
vigilance
is
to
the
father
and
mother
those
that
have
experience
know
best
especially
when
they
in
the
morning
call
their
son
to
confession
and
between
anger
and
love
catechize
him
with
severall
natural
and
kind
reproofs
is
but
labour
lost
and
ill
whistling
if
the
horse
wo
drink
what
remedy
turn
it
and
wind
it
so
as
you
will
son
his
mind
to
study
is
full
bent
or
else
will
live
upon
his
yearly
here
must
be
a
counsell
held
by
wisdom
prudence
love
and
patience
here
also
the
imaginations
of
incapableness
or
want
of
monies
must
be
conquered
for
to
constrain
a
son
to
that
he
hath
no
mind
to
is
the
ready
way
to
dull
his
genious
and
perhaps
bring
him
to
what
is
worser
to
wit
running
after
whores
or
gaming
and
to
teach
him
how
to
live
upon
his
yearly
means
the
tools
are
too
damn
costly
so
that
now
the
parents
have
true
experience
of
the
old
proverb
children
in
their
youth
oft
make
their
parents
smart
being
come
to
riper
years
they
vex
their
very
nevertheless
after
you
have
turn
it
and
wound
it
so
as
you
will
the
sending
of
him
to
the
university
of
oxford
bears
the
sway
and
there
to
let
him
study
theology
being
the
modestest
faculty
by
one
of
the
learnedst
and
famousest
doctors
and
verily
he
goes
forward
so
nobly
that
in
few
months
before
he
half
knows
the
needfull
philosophy
he
is
found
to
be
a
master
of
arts
in
villany
and
moreover
the
parents
were
by
some
good
friends
informed
that
lately
he
was
acting
the
domineering
student
and
being
catcht
by
the
watch
was
brought
into
the
court
of
guard
but
through
the
extraordinary
intercession
of
his
own
and
some
other
doctors
they
privately
let
him
go
out
again
a
little
longer
time
being
expired
he
sends
post
upon
post
dunning
letters
his
quarter
of
the
years
out
his
pockets
empty
and
the
landlady
wants
mony
besides
there
are
severall
other
things
that
he
wants
both
of
linnen
and
woollen
all
which
things
yield
an
extraordinary
pleasure
especially
if
the
mony
which
is
sent
without
suffring
shipwrack
be
imploied
and
laid
out
for
those
necessaries
for
some
students
are
so
deeply
learnt
that
they
consume
the
monies
they
get
in
mirth
and
jovialty
and
leave
their
landladies
booksellers
tailors
shoomakers
and
all
whom
they
are
indebted
to
unpaid
nay
his
own
cousin
that
studied
at
cambridge
knew
very
learnedly
how
to
make
a
cleaver
dispatch
with
his
at
gutterlane
of
all
the
mony
that
was
sent
him
by
his
parents
for
his
promotion
and
under
the
covert
of
many
well
studied
lies
desired
more
but
who
knows
what
wonderfull
students
tricks
before
he
is
half
so
perfect
your
son
will
have
learnt
to
make
his
father
and
mother
merry
with
for
as
i
have
heard
he
hath
gotten
so
much
aquaintance
that
he
hath
the
bookseller
to
be
his
friend
who
sets
down
the
prizes
of
the
books
he
delivers
three
times
as
much
again
as
they
are
worth
and
for
the
overplus
he
with
some
other
students
are
bravely
merry
together
yea
he
come
so
far
himself
that
he
doth
to
get
mony
know
how
to
sell
his
best
authors
and
sets
in
place
of
them
some
blocks
very
neatly
cut
and
coloured
like
gallant
books
and
if
any
one
comes
that
will
lay
their
hands
upon
them
he
saith
immediately
eat
drink
smoke
and
be
merry
to
your
hearts
content
but
whatsoever
you
do
touch
not
my
books
for
that
as
a
medean
law
and
an
inviolable
statute
in
my
chamber
as
it
doth
to
the
same
purpose
stand
written
thus
before
my
chamber
of
books
jolly
sing
and
dance
command
me
with
a
look
one
thing
i
do
forbid
you
must
not
touch
a
the
old
proverb
saith
it
must
bend
well
before
it
can
make
a
good
hook
but
it
is
easie
to
be
perceived
by
the
beginning
what
may
be
expected
from
the
flexibility
of
this
precious
twig
o
extraordinary
and
magnificent
pleasure
for
the
parents
when
they
see
that
their
son
in
so
short
a
time
is
so
damnably
advanced
and
so
much
the
more
a
little
while
after
there
comes
one
and
tells
them
by
word
of
mouth
that
there
were
several
schollars
which
were
playing
some
antick
tricks
in
the
night
and
amongst
some
others
both
their
son
and
their
cousin
were
apprehended
and
at
this
very
present
sad
accusations
were
brought
in
against
them
in
the
mean
while
the
chancellor
having
heard
that
they
are
all
persons
of
good
parentage
and
that
there
will
be
brave
greasing
in
the
case
laughs
in
his
fist
because
such
things
as
those
are
generally
moderated
and
assopiated
by
the
means
and
infallible
vertue
of
the
correcting
finger
hearb
this
brings
the
parents
a
fine
bartholomew
baby
to
play
with
and
if
there
ly
loosely
in
a
corner
a
fifty
pound
bag
they
will
go
nigh
to
see
how
they
may
make
use
of
it
and
this
gives
a
horrible
augmentation
to
the
pleasures
of
marriage
but
let
them
turn
it
and
wind
it
which
way
they
will
the
parents
must
go
thither
and
seek
by
all
means
possible
according
to
their
ability
to
pacific
the
matter
as
they
are
upon
their
journy
they
hear
in
every
town
where
they
come
how
debauched
and
wicked
lives
the
students
leads
not
only
concerning
that
which
was
lately
done
at
oxford
but
at
other
places
also
which
makes
them
be
in
no
small
fear
whether
their
son
perhaps
may
not
be
guilty
only
of
this
but
some
worser
misdemeanor
and
is
therefore
at
present
clapt
up
here
master
truetale
begins
to
relate
that
lately
there
were
four
students
who
for
some
petulancy
had
been
at
confession
by
the
mayor
and
he
with
their
vomiting
up
some
guinies
gave
them
their
absolutions
but
they
perceiving
that
hereby
their
purses
were
cruelly
weakned
and
that
the
return
of
monies
did
not
come
according
to
expectation
took
a
resolution
to
get
some
revenge
of
him
for
it
and
he
having
built
a
new
house
caused
it
by
a
curious
workman
to
be
neatly
painted
on
the
outside
which
these
four
students
seeing
they
took
a
good
quantity
of
tar
and
did
so
damnably
bedawb
it
that
it
looked
as
if
old
nick
had
been
there
with
his
rubbing
brush
which
the
mayor
seeing
in
the
morning
seemed
to
be
little
troubled
at
it
but
said
certainly
some
body
hath
done
this
that
i
have
taken
too
little
mony
of
and
therefore
in
gratitude
have
for
nothing
thus
bepainted
my
delicately
painted
house
but
nevertheless
the
mayor
sends
in
the
evening
five
or
six
spies
abroad
into
those
taverns
and
alehouses
where
the
lightest
students
generally
frequented
who
were
smoking
and
drinking
there
and
amongst
other
discourses
related
how
it
tickled
their
fancies
that
the
covetous
mayor
was
served
such
a
delicate
trik
whereupon
some
of
them
hearing
that
the
action
was
so
much
commended
and
that
the
mayor
made
no
search
about
it
saies
that
was
my
work
with
james
smith
the
londoner
jack
dove
the
kentishman
and
sanny
clow
the
scotch
man
upon
this
they
were
all
four
apprehended
in
the
night
and
very
cleaverly
clapt
by
the
heels
hereupon
mistriss
credit
said
there
are
no
such
wicked
inventers
of
mischief
as
moniless
students
of
which
we
had
lately
a
new
example
for
some
of
those
blades
wanting
mony
were
resolved
to
act
this
trick
some
few
daies
before
there
was
a
malefactor
hanged
and
one
of
them
between
eleven
and
twelve
of
the
clock
at
night
gets
hard
by
the
gallows
where
he
hung
and
feigned
to
be
the
spirit
of
the
malefactor
sometimes
appearing
and
then
again
vanishing
in
the
mean
while
the
rest
of
his
companions
all
separate
from
each
other
as
if
they
had
been
strangers
placed
themselves
not
far
from
it
each
of
them
seemed
to
be
frightned
and
shewed
unto
all
the
passers
by
that
there
was
the
spirit
of
the
malefactor
that
was
executed
this
run
forward
like
wild
fire
in
somuch
that
the
number
of
the
spectators
increased
abundantly
and
whilest
every
one
was
so
busie
in
beholding
it
the
moniless
students
were
as
serious
in
picking
of
their
pockets
cutting
the
silver
buttons
off
their
cloaths
which
no
body
perceived
till
the
spirit
was
vanished
and
they
were
gotten
home
so
did
i
know
saith
master
mouth
two
necessitous
students
who
at
a
observed
that
a
country
man
having
sold
some
commodities
that
he
brought
to
market
had
received
five
or
six
crown
pieces
for
them
and
went
amongst
the
booths
to
buy
somthing
but
feared
in
the
throng
one
or
another
might
steal
them
from
him
therefore
would
not
trust
them
in
his
pocket
nor
with
his
purse
in
the
breast
of
his
doublet
but
puts
them
in
his
mouth
saying
no
body
i
sure
can
take
them
from
thence
and
walks
into
the
booths
there
cheapning
a
hat
in
the
mean
while
one
of
these
students
goes
to
the
very
next
booth
buies
some
pedling
thing
and
pulling
mony
out
of
his
pocket
to
pay
saith
what
a
pox
is
the
meaning
of
this
just
now
i
had
several
crown
pieces
and
now
i
have
nothing
and
since
that
there
hath
no
body
else
been
near
me
but
this
country
fellow
and
begins
to
catch
him
by
the
shoulders
saying
hark
ye
squire
i
miss
several
crown
pieces
which
i
had
but
just
now
this
so
amazed
the
country
man
that
he
began
to
mumble
with
the
crown
pieces
in
his
mouth
whereupon
the
student
said
i
verily
beleeve
the
villain
hath
them
in
his
mouth
the
country
man
answered
thereupon
those
that
i
have
in
my
mouth
are
my
own
i
received
them
just
now
for
some
commodities
but
let
the
country
man
say
what
he
would
it
was
not
beleeved
he
was
lamentably
beaten
his
crown
pieces
taken
from
him
and
given
to
the
student
by
this
you
may
perceive
saith
master
otherway
that
the
proverb
is
true
is
i
was
lately
told
of
some
poor
troublesom
students
who
had
a
little
way
off
the
city
caused
a
dainty
feast
to
be
made
ready
for
them
and
knowing
that
the
landlord
had
a
brother
whom
he
extreamly
loved
which
lived
about
five
and
twenty
miles
off
write
a
letter
to
the
landlord
and
therein
acquaint
him
that
his
brother
was
very
desperately
sick
oftentimes
calling
for
him
therefore
if
he
would
see
and
speak
with
him
alive
he
must
with
all
possible
speed
immediately
come
thither
then
they
found
out
such
a
cleaver
contryvance
to
have
this
letter
delivered
into
the
hands
of
the
landlord
that
he
had
not
the
least
distrust
of
a
cheat
but
away
he
rides
immediately
in
the
mean
while
these
students
committed
much
sauciness
and
wantonness
with
the
mistriss
and
the
maid
till
at
last
locking
them
both
up
in
a
chamber
away
they
went
without
paying
to
this
a
miller
that
sate
close
by
relates
that
lately
not
far
from
his
house
two
students
laid
violent
hands
upon
a
woman
and
bound
her
to
a
post
is
a
wonder
saith
master
demure
proceeding
forward
that
since
they
commit
such
wicked
and
so
many
base
actions
more
of
these
students
are
not
apprehended
when
i
dwelt
at
my
country
house
there
came
a
parcel
of
these
drunken
blades
that
were
expresly
gone
abroad
to
play
some
mad
tricks
they
pulled
down
the
pales
of
my
neighbors
garden
and
one
among
them
that
served
for
chief
commanded
pull
off
these
planks
tear
up
this
post
in
the
mean
time
a
poor
country
man
coming
by
with
his
empty
wagon
begs
of
this
commander
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
bestow
upon
him
those
old
planks
and
posts
for
his
winter
firing
because
he
was
so
poor
that
he
knew
not
where
to
get
any
which
this
gentleman
granting
him
he
laies
on
a
lusty
load
upon
his
wagon
being
drove
a
pretty
way
of
the
owner
comes
to
the
place
and
sees
in
what
a
lamentable
condition
his
garden
lay
asks
who
had
done
it
and
understands
that
they
were
students
which
had
taken
their
march
towards
some
of
the
adjacent
country
towns
but
that
the
country
man
with
his
planks
must
needs
be
got
very
far
from
the
city
away
runs
the
owner
with
all
speed
makes
his
complaint
and
gets
an
order
to
arrest
the
poor
country
man
his
horse
and
wagon
who
coming
to
be
examined
at
his
triall
was
condemned
to
be
set
in
the
pillory
with
two
planks
set
before
him
upon
which
must
be
written
in
great
white
letters
these
wicked
students
stood
together
to
behold
this
and
laught
till
they
split
to
see
that
this
poor
innocent
country
man
must
suffer
such
shame
and
punishment
for
his
winter
firing
just
in
the
same
manner
not
long
ago
some
divellish
students
had
taken
a
heavy
rail
from
before
a
house
which
was
newly
set
there
but
hearing
that
the
watch
or
bell
man
approched
they
presently
whept
it
before
another
mans
dore
where
there
was
none
and
leaning
all
of
them
over
the
rail
saluted
the
watch
with
saying
good
night
gentlemen
good
night
and
the
watch
the
like
to
them
again
but
the
watch
was
no
sooner
gone
then
they
fell
to
breaking
of
it
all
in
peeces
and
run
away
as
fast
as
they
could
drive
those
people
are
unhappy
saith
master
talkon
especially
such
as
live
in
country
towns
that
are
near
to
cities
where
there
are
universities
for
many
times
one
or
another
must
be
a
sufferer
from
these
roguish
natured
students
and
they
imagine
in
themselves
that
all
what
the
country
people
possess
must
be
at
their
pleasure
and
disposition
whereby
it
happens
in
the
summer
that
for
their
wicked
pastime
they
go
to
rob
the
orchards
of
the
best
fruit
and
to
steal
hens
ducks
and
pigeons
and
then
again
to
destroy
the
fields
of
turnips
carrots
parsnips
beans
and
pease
tearing
up
such
multiplicities
that
it
would
be
incredible
if
we
should
relate
it
all
but
it
is
common
for
them
to
destroy
ten
times
as
much
as
they
can
eat
or
carry
away
and
when
the
summer
is
past
that
there
are
no
fruits
either
in
orchards
or
fields
then
their
whole
delight
and
recreation
is
to
commit
insolencies
in
the
streets
of
the
city
by
night
and
if
they
can
but
any
waies
put
an
affront
upon
the
watch
that
is
laught
at
and
esteemed
to
be
an
heroick
act
it
hapned
lately
that
some
students
walking
out
of
town
saw
a
little
boy
in
the
fields
that
was
holding
the
cord
of
an
indifferent
kite
which
was
in
the
air
in
his
hand
they
laughing
at
him
said
the
kite
is
bigger
than
the
boy
come
let
us
ty
the
cord
about
the
boy
then
they
will
not
lose
one
another
and
immediately
catching
hold
of
the
boy
they
forced
the
cord
from
him
and
bound
it
fast
about
his
middle
in
a
great
many
knots
then
went
their
way
whilest
the
boy
was
very
busie
and
indeavouring
to
unty
the
knots
the
wind
grew
high
insomuch
that
the
boy
used
all
his
strength
to
hold
back
the
cord
but
his
strength
failing
him
he
was
with
a
furious
blast
snatcht
up
by
the
kite
from
the
ground
and
presently
after
let
fall
again
into
a
pretty
deep
ditch
where
the
poor
innocent
boy
was
unhappily
drowned
it
would
be
sempiternal
for
us
here
to
make
a
relation
of
all
the
petulancy
and
wickedness
of
students
whereof
these
and
other
parents
each
in
their
particular
are
miserably
sensible
of
for
every
one
acts
his
own
part
but
it
tends
altogether
unto
wickedness
lavishness
and
troublesomness
here
you
may
see
master
takes
the
greatest
delight
in
the
world
nobly
to
treat
some
northern
gentlemen
of
his
acquaintance
and
and
then
again
to
be
treated
by
them
where
there
is
an
absolute
agreement
made
that
when
any
one
of
them
gets
mony
from
their
parents
he
shall
give
the
company
a
treat
of
five
guinnies
and
though
they
generally
observe
that
before
they
part
one
quarrel
or
other
arises
and
the
swords
drawn
yet
this
law
is
inviolabler
than
ever
any
statutes
of
henry
the
viii
were
which
continued
so
long
till
one
of
them
be
desperately
wounded
or
killed
and
he
that
did
it
apprehended
and
to
the
great
greef
of
his
parents
tried
for
his
life
or
else
flies
his
country
to
save
it
others
we
may
see
that
have
no
greater
pleasure
then
to
sit
whole
nights
with
their
companions
playing
at
tables
and
there
game
away
rings
hats
cloaks
and
swords
and
then
ply
one
another
so
close
with
whole
bumpers
of
sack
and
old
hock
that
they
are
worse
then
senceless
beasts
feeling
and
groping
of
the
very
walls
and
tumbling
and
wallowing
to
and
fro
in
their
own
nastiness
and
esteem
it
to
be
a
championlike
action
if
one
can
but
make
the
dead
drunk
by
his
voracity
of
sucking
in
most
as
if
they
intended
hereby
to
become
learned
doctors
some
again
are
most
horribly
addicted
to
frequent
the
pestilential
of
which
they
are
never
satisfied
till
mony
cloaths
books
and
their
own
health
of
body
is
consumed
and
then
come
home
to
their
parents
soundly
peppered
some
there
are
that
oftentimes
so
deeply
ingage
themselves
with
their
landlords
daughters
that
they
can
answer
to
her
examination
without
the
knowledge
either
of
their
parents
or
doctors
and
are
fit
for
promotion
in
the
art
of
nature
but
if
the
landlady
hath
never
a
daughter
of
her
own
there
a
neece
or
neighbors
daughter
which
knows
how
to
shew
her
self
there
so
neatly
that
with
her
tripping
and
mincing
she
makes
signals
enough
that
at
their
house
cubicula
locanda
is
to
be
had
and
these
are
the
true
divers
that
know
infinitely
well
how
to
empty
the
students
pockets
thus
doth
every
one
act
their
parts
whilest
the
parents
are
indeavouring
to
gather
and
scrape
all
together
that
they
can
that
their
son
who
is
many
times
the
onliest
or
eldest
may
go
forward
in
his
study
and
become
perfect
in
one
faculty
and
the
more
because
they
see
that
he
is
and
according
as
his
doctor
saith
a
very
hopefull
young
man
little
thinking
that
he
makes
as
bad
use
of
those
natural
benefits
as
he
is
lavish
of
his
mony
but
it
is
a
common
saying
that
the
must
have
their
wills
which
oftentimes
occasions
that
when
they
have
studied
a
long
time
in
divinity
they
finally
turn
to
be
some
inns
of
court
gentlemen
fearing
that
their
wild
students
life
might
in
any
other
vocation
be
cast
in
their
teeth
yet
somtimes
it
also
happens
that
from
the
very
first
they
behave
themselves
modestly
and
advance
so
gallantly
in
their
studies
that
it
is
a
comfort
for
their
parents
and
great
benefit
for
themselves
but
nevertheless
though
they
obtain
their
promotion
with
commendation
reputation
and
great
charges
yet
it
is
all
but
fastidious
unless
their
parents
can
leave
or
give
them
some
considerable
means
or
that
they
through
their
brave
behaviours
perfections
and
sweet
discourses
can
inveagle
themselves
in
to
a
rich
match
for
many
years
are
spent
before
they
can
get
a
parsonage
or
benefice
and
when
it
doth
happen
in
some
country
town
the
means
will
hardly
maintain
them
if
he
be
a
counsellor
or
doctor
of
physick
what
a
deal
of
time
runs
away
before
he
can
come
in
to
practice
especially
if
in
the
one
he
hath
not
the
good
fortune
to
get
the
two
or
three
first
causes
for
his
clients
and
in
the
other
not
to
make
satisfactory
cures
of
his
first
patients
therefore
what
a
joy
would
it
have
been
for
the
parents
if
their
son
had
spent
his
time
in
understanding
and
been
obedient
to
the
exhortations
of
his
parents
but
though
some
do
this
and
are
therein
compliant
to
their
parents
yet
we
perceive
that
this
also
is
subject
to
many
vexations
by
reason
that
the
children
through
a
contrary
drift
many
times
disturb
their
parents
night
rest
especially
when
there
are
such
kind
of
maids
in
the
house
that
will
listen
to
their
humors
and
fancies
these
will
for
the
most
part
please
their
master
and
mistriss
to
the
full
and
do
all
things
so
that
their
mistriss
shall
be
satisfied
and
have
no
occasion
to
look
out
for
another
and
yet
in
the
mean
while
all
their
main
aim
is
to
get
and
intice
the
son
with
their
neatness
cleanliness
friendliness
and
gentileness
to
be
on
their
side
to
that
end
knowing
how
as
well
as
their
mistriss
to
hood
themselves
curl
their
locks
and
wantonly
overspread
their
breasts
with
a
peece
of
fine
lawn
or
cambrick
that
they
seem
rather
to
be
finically
over
shadowed
then
covered
and
may
the
better
allure
the
weak
eys
of
the
beholders
these
know
that
dame
nature
hath
placed
her
best
features
in
a
city
maid
as
well
as
in
a
lady
at
court
and
that
there
are
no
keener
swords
or
stronger
steels
to
penetrate
through
the
hearts
of
men
then
the
handsom
bodiedness
comly
and
kind
behaviour
of
women
this
is
oftentimes
the
occasion
that
the
son
hath
more
inclination
towards
her
then
he
hath
for
a
gentlewoman
of
a
good
family
and
indifferent
fortune
nay
it
transports
him
so
that
they
finally
make
use
of
one
bed
and
the
son
much
unexpected
by
the
parents
is
come
to
be
father
himself
but
what
an
inestimable
pleasure
of
marriage
this
is
for
the
new
grandfather
and
grandmother
every
one
may
judge
especially
if
it
happens
as
i
saw
once
that
the
prentice
lay
with
his
masters
daughter
and
the
son
with
the
kitchin
wench
and
the
prentice
run
away
with
the
daughter
and
the
son
would
by
all
means
marry
with
the
kitchin
wench
which
was
such
a
great
grief
for
the
parents
that
it
might
be
justly
termed
rather
one
of
the
terrors
than
pleasures
of
marriage
so
that
we
see
although
the
children
be
at
home
by
their
parents
or
in
the
shop
and
remain
under
their
view
and
tuition
yet
nevertheless
by
one
or
other
never
to
be
expected
occasion
they
fall
in
to
evill
courses
which
every
one
that
brings
up
children
hath
such
manifold
and
several
waies
experience
of
that
it
would
be
infinite
and
too
tiresom
to
give
you
an
account
of
all
the
confessions
therefore
we
will
pass
by
these
as
if
we
were
running
a
and
to
shorten
our
journy
return
again
to
our
well
married
couple
from
whom
we
are
cruelly
straied
you
see
and
observe
then
o
well
married
couple
what
strange
tricks
and
actions
that
children
will
play
if
yours
act
then
the
part
of
a
liberal
son
or
wanton
student
rejoice
therein
that
you
have
not
brought
forth
a
dunce
or
blockhead
but
since
his
doctor
saith
that
he
is
and
a
hopefull
youth
doubt
not
but
that
you
will
when
he
comes
to
his
seriouser
years
with
delight
and
pleasure
see
him
to
be
a
great
man
illustration
by
the
navarre
society
for
it
hath
many
times
hapned
that
those
who
have
been
the
maddest
and
wildest
students
at
the
university
have
afterwards
come
to
be
noble
personages
ministers
of
state
and
learned
doctors
of
whom
we
could
relate
unto
you
several
examples
if
we
knew
certainly
that
the
revealing
of
that
confession
would
not
be
ill
taken
thrice
happy
are
you
o
noble
couple
that
you
are
yet
in
possession
of
the
pleasures
of
the
first
marriage
and
are
not
troubled
with
the
contention
of
a
or
over
your
children
nor
with
their
or
children
of
the
second
bed
for
whatsoever
happens
to
you
now
comes
from
a
web
of
your
own
spinning
and
your
love
to
that
conquers
and
covers
all
infirmities
because
we
know
very
well
that
that
certainly
compleats
one
of
the
pleasures
of
marriage
the
ninth
pleasure
base
conditioned
true
it
seems
to
fall
both
tart
and
bitter
when
the
children
take
such
lavish
courses
and
get
such
wild
hairs
in
their
nostrils
the
sons
acting
the
parts
of
spendthrifts
and
petulant
students
and
the
daughters
of
light
punks
as
long
as
these
things
remain
so
they
appear
to
be
but
very
sober
pleasures
of
marriage
but
when
we
perceive
that
these
thorns
being
past
the
pleasant
roses
appear
and
that
these
light
hearted
students
finally
come
to
be
gallant
practitioners
o
that
affords
you
the
most
satisfactory
and
largest
pleasure
of
marriage
that
ever
could
be
expected
so
also
if
you
perceive
that
your
daughters
are
lively
active
and
airy
that
somtimes
they
would
rather
go
to
a
play
then
to
church
or
rather
be
merry
of
an
evening
than
at
sermon
in
the
morning
and
grow
to
be
altogether
mannish
minded
you
must
then
conclude
these
are
natural
instincts
if
it
happen
to
fall
out
contrary
to
your
expectation
that
she
hath
more
mind
to
a
brave
young
fellow
that
a
prentice
whose
parts
and
humor
she
knows
then
she
hath
in
a
plush
jacketted
or
gilt
midas
then
make
your
selves
joyfull
in
the
several
examples
that
you
have
of
others
who
being
so
married
have
proved
to
be
the
best
matches
of
which
examples
multiplicities
are
at
large
prostrated
to
your
view
in
the
theater
of
lovers
so
that
you
do
herein
yet
find
the
pleasure
of
marriage
but
it
is
much
farther
to
be
sought
for
among
the
vexations
which
people
have
not
only
from
children
but
from
lasie
tailing
lavish
and
servants
done
unto
them
somtimes
by
their
men
but
generally
by
the
foolish
and
stifnecked
maids
these
can
make
their
master
totally
forget
his
base
viol
and
singing
of
musick
and
their
mistriss
the
playing
upon
the
virginals
it
was
a
much
less
trouble
for
arion
and
orfeus
to
charm
all
the
senceless
creatures
both
of
sea
and
land
in
those
daies
then
it
is
now
for
to
bring
their
servants
to
a
due
obedience
neither
is
this
strange
because
some
maids
when
they
see
they
have
gotten
a
kind
natured
and
mild
gentlewoman
to
their
mistriss
immediately
practice
by
all
means
possible
to
rule
and
domineer
over
her
insomuch
that
whatsoever
the
mistriss
orders
or
commands
she
knows
how
according
to
the
imagination
of
her
own
understanding
to
order
and
do
it
otherwise
and
dare
many
times
boldly
contradict
them
and
say
it
would
be
better
if
this
were
done
then
and
that
and
if
the
mistriss
be
so
mild
that
she
condescends
and
passes
by
this
some
times
they
are
immediately
in
their
own
conceits
as
wise
again
as
their
mistriss
and
dare
when
they
come
among
their
tailing
gossips
brag
that
they
can
bend
their
mistriss
to
their
bow
and
if
their
mistriss
bids
them
do
any
thing
they
do
it
when
it
pleases
them
or
at
their
own
oportunity
for
their
mistriss
is
troubled
with
the
simples
a
but
if
it
happen
so
that
one
of
these
wenches
comes
into
a
service
where
the
mistriss
is
a
notable
spirited
woman
that
looks
sharply
and
circumspectly
to
the
government
of
her
family
then
damnably
put
and
is
troubled
in
spirit
that
her
mistriss
will
not
understand
it
so
as
she
would
fain
have
it
according
to
her
manner
and
gets
this
to
an
answer
do
it
as
i
command
you
then
it
is
well
though
it
were
ill
done
let
your
mistriss
command
its
your
duty
to
obey
or
else
next
time
you
must
hire
your
self
out
for
mistriss
and
not
for
maid
how
pleasant
this
answer
was
to
jane
it
appears
because
she
no
sooner
gets
out
but
she
runs
to
goody
that
hires
out
servants
where
she
makes
no
smal
complaint
of
her
mistresses
insulting
spirit
and
asks
whether
she
knows
not
of
a
hire
for
her
by
some
houskeeping
batchelor
or
widower
because
she
understands
the
ordring
of
her
work
very
well
is
a
special
good
cook
and
loves
children
then
she
would
leave
her
mistriss
and
tell
her
that
her
aunt
was
very
sick
and
lay
a
dying
and
that
she
must
go
thither
goody
is
presently
ready
because
she
sees
here
is
a
means
to
earn
double
wages
the
maid
must
be
provided
with
another
service
and
the
mistriss
with
another
maid
so
she
begins
like
a
broker
to
turn
and
wind
it
about
every
way
to
rid
her
self
of
the
one
and
then
to
recommend
another
in
the
place
though
it
be
mighty
inconvenient
for
the
mistriss
and
troubles
her
because
she
many
times
may
be
near
her
or
some
other
pressing
necessity
whose
merrier
then
jane
for
she
hath
gotten
a
new
service
by
a
widower
and
can
order
and
govern
all
things
now
according
to
her
own
mind
where
she
hath
not
the
name
of
a
maid
but
of
a
governantess
nay
now
she
cunning
enough
to
bridle
in
all
her
ill
conditions
and
watches
the
very
ey
of
her
master
keeping
all
things
very
cleanly
and
neat
in
order
upon
hopes
that
her
master
might
fall
into
a
good
humour
and
make
a
place
also
for
her
in
his
bed
for
verily
she
loves
children
so
well
that
she
would
be
helping
to
get
one
her
self
to
which
purpose
she
useth
all
inventions
imaginable
running
too
and
again
about
the
house
and
her
breasts
raised
up
or
comes
to
his
bedside
all
unlaced
or
fains
to
sit
sleeping
by
the
fire
side
with
her
coats
up
to
her
knees
against
her
master
comes
home
with
the
key
in
his
pocket
merrily
disposed
from
his
companions
or
with
a
short
coat
on
stoops
down
very
low
in
the
presence
of
her
master
to
take
up
somthing
from
or
clean
the
flore
or
climbs
up
a
ladder
to
rub
the
glass
windows
and
knows
of
a
thousand
such
manner
of
inticements
of
which
there
never
a
one
of
them
but
if
the
master
have
any
flesh
or
blood
in
him
are
sufficient
to
catch
and
insnare
him
for
this
hapned
to
her
fellow
creature
who
having
dwelt
some
indifferent
time
with
a
widower
he
came
home
one
evening
pretty
merry
and
jestingly
talked
to
her
about
her
sweetheart
there
peggy
be
carefull
and
when
you
come
to
marry
i
will
give
you
this
bed
that
i
ly
on
with
all
that
belongs
to
whereupon
the
maid
answered
sir
if
i
shall
have
all
that
justly
belongs
to
it
i
must
have
you
also
sir
for
it
is
yours
and
you
ly
upon
the
answer
pleased
the
master
so
well
that
he
catches
peggy
in
his
arms
throws
her
upon
the
bed
and
lies
down
by
her
till
at
last
in
spite
of
all
his
relations
he
made
his
maid
his
wife
who
being
married
then
began
to
discover
her
stifnecked
humors
that
she
had
so
long
kept
secret
but
it
was
the
occasion
of
both
their
ruines
but
we
will
leave
jane
and
peggy
with
their
widowers
and
take
a
view
what
kind
of
a
pleasure
of
marriage
that
our
mistriss
possesseth
with
her
new
maid
for
goody
recommended
her
highly
to
be
a
very
honest
vertuous
maid
of
a
good
family
and
gave
her
self
security
for
her
fidelity
nevertheless
there
are
hardly
three
daies
past
but
the
mistriss
perceives
that
she
is
notably
inclined
to
toss
up
her
cup
but
for
the
better
certainty
the
mistriss
commands
her
to
draw
some
wine
in
a
glass
that
was
very
clean
rinsed
which
she
no
sooner
brought
back
but
the
mistriss
observed
that
greasy
lips
had
been
at
it
yet
before
she
sent
her
the
second
time
she
takes
a
trencher
and
holds
it
over
the
smoke
of
a
candle
to
grow
black
then
with
her
finger
rubs
that
soot
upon
the
edge
or
hollow
part
of
the
glass
and
commanded
her
as
she
did
before
to
draw
some
wine
but
when
she
came
back
again
the
mistriss
then
perceived
that
the
round
circle
of
the
glass
was
impressed
upon
both
sides
of
her
mouth
and
upon
her
forehead
who
can
abstain
themselves
from
laughter
when
they
see
such
a
marked
sheep
come
out
of
the
wine
cellar
who
could
imagine
that
a
maid
in
three
daies
time
should
occasion
so
much
pleasure
of
marriage
how
much
more
mirth
will
you
receive
from
her
when
she
has
taken
a
good
bowsing
cup
to
be
jolly
you
have
here
a
triall
of
her
fidelity
that
goody
vaunted
of
for
the
future
she
may
very
well
say
that
she
is
mighty
dexterous
at
smuckling
of
wine
who
knows
but
she
may
get
an
angel
a
year
the
more
wages
for
it
but
whilest
she
pleases
her
mistriss
with
this
sight
the
causes
her
to
enjoy
a
new
recreation
for
she
having
gotten
leave
to
go
to
church
in
tarries
out
till
seven
of
the
clock
in
the
evening
tho
she
knows
there
are
friends
invited
to
supper
the
children
must
be
got
to
bed
and
all
things
set
in
good
order
neither
is
it
strange
for
she
thinks
i
am
now
the
eldest
maid
the
may
attend
when
i
hired
my
self
my
mistriss
told
me
i
should
go
on
sundaies
to
church
and
also
when
occasion
served
after
sermon
i
should
walk
abroad
for
an
hour
or
two
and
now
there
is
a
very
good
opportunity
because
she
hath
another
maid
at
home
she
keeps
singing
in
this
tune
and
finally
coming
home
thinks
that
she
has
a
great
deal
of
reason
on
her
side
and
is
not
ashamed
to
retort
ten
cross
words
for
one
is
no
wonder
neither
for
she
had
been
talking
with
mistriss
sayall
the
cupster
who
had
cupt
her
but
the
sunday
before
and
then
told
her
that
she
could
observe
out
of
her
physiognomy
and
the
course
of
her
blood
several
infallible
signs
that
she
should
come
to
be
a
woman
of
good
quality
and
that
she
would
not
be
above
a
year
unmarried
also
there
came
thither
at
the
same
time
dorothy
and
margery
whom
mistriss
sayall
had
in
like
manner
prognosticated
what
was
befallen
them
these
did
not
a
little
admire
that
she
being
now
the
eldest
maid
earned
such
small
wages
and
that
her
mistriss
did
not
raise
it
because
she
deserved
at
the
least
fifteen
shillings
a
year
more
and
a
better
new
years
gift
and
fairing
thus
they
stuff
one
anothers
pates
full
and
mistriss
sayall
and
goody
busiebody
seem
to
be
as
if
they
were
sisters
cast
in
one
mould
for
the
one
knows
how
to
blow
the
simple
wenches
ears
full
and
the
worse
then
a
bawd
makes
them
and
keep
both
of
them
a
school
for
wenches
and
lazy
sluts
to
natter
to
exhort
and
to
exasperate
in
yet
these
half
carry
themselves
before
the
mistresses
like
saints
but
do
indeed
shew
themselves
to
be
the
most
deceitfullest
cheats
who
carry
alwaies
fire
in
one
hand
and
water
in
the
these
know
how
very
subtlely
many
times
to
fatten
their
carkasses
with
meat
and
drink
out
of
the
mistresses
cellars
and
butteries
keeping
alwaies
a
fair
correspondence
with
the
theevish
maids
which
know
many
tricks
and
waies
how
to
convey
it
unto
them
and
scold
and
brawl
against
those
whose
stoln
meat
and
drink
they
thus
idly
and
basely
convey
away
these
use
again
all
possible
indeavours
to
recommend
them
here
or
there
to
a
sweetheart
and
make
their
own
houses
serve
as
an
exchange
for
this
negotiation
where
they
appear
as
precise
at
their
hours
as
a
merchant
doth
at
this
it
is
that
makes
them
look
like
a
dog
in
a
halter
when
they
can
not
get
leave
on
sundaies
to
go
a
gadding
and
it
is
a
wonder
they
do
not
bargain
for
it
when
they
hire
themselves
though
there
are
some
that
are
not
ashamed
who
dare
not
so
openly
confess
this
to
bargain
that
they
may
go
every
sunday
to
church
as
if
they
were
extraordinary
devout
when
it
is
really
to
no
other
end
then
to
set
out
their
gins
to
catch
some
tailor
baker
shoomaker
cooper
carpenter
mason
or
such
like
journyman
which
is
hardly
passed
by
to
satisfie
their
fleshly
lusts
before
they
perceive
that
they
have
chosen
a
poor
and
wretched
for
a
plentifull
livelihood
and
are
often
by
their
husbands
beaten
like
stockfish
though
lent
be
long
past
but
what
delight
they
have
in
being
curried
with
this
sort
of
comb
the
neighbours
can
judge
by
the
miserable
songs
they
sing
these
find
also
the
pleasures
of
marriage
at
which
they
have
so
long
aimed
and
so
much
indeavoured
for
and
would
now
gladly
lick
their
fingers
at
that
which
they
have
many
times
thrown
away
upon
the
dunghills
or
in
the
kennels
falling
many
times
into
deplorable
poverty
or
to
receive
alms
from
the
churchwardens
and
charitable
people
of
which
there
are
vast
numbers
of
examples
too
lamentable
and
terrible
to
be
related
by
this
small
relation
you
may
see
what
kind
of
points
these
sort
of
people
have
upon
their
compass
but
to
write
the
true
nature
and
actions
of
such
rubbish
were
to
no
other
purpose
then
to
foul
a
vast
quantity
of
paper
with
a
deal
of
trash
and
trumpery
for
many
are
damnably
liquorish
tooth
everlasting
tattlesters
lazy
salt
bitches
continual
mumblers
out
of
their
pockets
wicked
scolds
lavish
drones
secret
drinckers
stifnecked
dunces
tyrants
over
children
stinking
sluts
mouldy
brain
trugs
hellish
sottish
gipsies
nay
and
sometimes
both
whorish
and
theevish
and
must
therefore
not
have
come
into
consideration
here
if
they
did
not
so
especially
belong
to
the
disconsolations
of
marriage
occasioning
many
times
more
troubles
and
disquiets
in
a
family
then
all
the
rest
of
the
adversities
that
may
befall
it
this
is
the
reason
that
makes
the
mistriss
many
times
turn
one
after
out
of
dores
and
is
afreard
that
a
new
one
should
come
in
again
and
is
also
ashamed
that
the
neighbors
should
see
every
foot
a
new
maid
upon
her
flore
who
by
an
evil
nature
are
ready
to
beleeve
the
worst
of
their
fellow
neighbours
what
is
told
them
by
a
slut
of
a
maid
though
they
many
times
observe
how
wickedly
they
are
plagued
with
their
own
o
pleasure
of
marriage
where
shall
we
make
a
conclusion
if
we
should
set
all
things
down
according
to
their
worth
and
value
certainly
every
one
would
to
that
purpose
want
a
clark
in
their
own
family
the
tenth
pleasure
empty
purse
makes
a
sorrowfull
pate
the
husband
grows
jealous
and
the
wife
also
the
husband
is
weary
of
his
wife
and
seeks
to
be
as
continual
prosperity
giveth
a
great
satisfaction
to
married
people
and
congealeth
their
hearts
more
and
more
with
a
fervent
love
so
on
the
contrary
we
many
times
see
that
when
they
are
oppressed
with
bad
trading
bankrupts
chargeable
housekeeping
and
children
it
occasions
and
raises
a
coolness
in
the
affections
insomuch
that
it
disquiets
their
rest
and
they
consume
the
whole
night
many
times
with
flying
fancies
and
cogitations
how
such
an
assignment
or
that
bill
of
exchange
or
the
last
half
years
rent
shal
be
paid
because
the
emptness
of
their
purse
and
the
slow
paiment
of
their
debtors
too
much
impedes
them
and
their
yearly
rents
are
so
small
and
uncertain
that
there
runs
away
many
times
more
in
reparations
and
taxations
annually
then
the
rents
amounts
to
this
occasions
disquiet
from
this
it
proceeds
that
many
times
when
they
rise
their
wits
run
a
and
they
are
more
inclined
to
look
crabbedly
grumble
and
mumble
then
to
shew
each
other
any
signs
of
love
and
friendship
for
an
empty
purse
makes
a
sorrowfull
pate
this
gives
no
smal
defeat
to
the
pleasures
of
marriage
now
they
begin
to
observe
that
there
is
no
state
or
condition
in
the
world
so
compleat
but
it
hath
some
kind
of
imperficiency
illustration
by
the
navarre
society
this
kind
of
necessity
may
by
a
man
in
a
tavern
with
good
company
be
rinsed
with
a
glass
of
wine
but
never
thereby
be
supplied
and
the
woman
may
with
singing
and
dandling
of
her
children
or
controuling
and
commanding
of
her
servants
a
little
forget
it
yet
nevertheless
when
john
the
cashier
comes
with
the
bill
of
exchange
and
william
the
bookkeeper
with
the
assignment
they
ought
both
to
be
paid
or
else
credit
and
respect
ly
at
the
stake
this
requires
a
great
deal
of
prudence
to
take
care
for
the
one
and
preserve
the
other
the
best
sort
of
matches
have
found
this
by
experience
to
be
true
and
for
that
reason
they
ofttimes
stop
a
little
hole
to
make
a
bigger
but
because
this
can
be
of
no
long
continuance
some
do
measure
their
business
smaller
out
at
first
and
dwell
at
a
lesser
rent
hire
out
their
chambers
and
cellars
and
afterwards
make
mony
of
some
movables
will
not
turmoil
themselves
with
so
much
trade
and
great
trust
nay
sometimes
also
take
some
other
trade
by
the
hand
the
commodities
whereof
are
of
a
quicker
consumption
and
if
this
happen
to
people
that
are
not
so
perfectly
well
match
as
our
couple
and
that
the
husband
hath
been
a
frequenter
of
company
you
shall
then
seldom
see
that
the
husband
and
the
wife
are
concordant
in
their
opinions
for
he
generally
will
be
for
trading
in
wine
and
tobacco
in
which
sort
of
commodities
he
is
well
studied
and
the
woman
is
for
dealing
in
linnen
stockings
gloves
or
such
like
wares
as
she
knows
best
how
to
traffick
with
and
verily
it
looks
but
sadly
although
it
oftentimes
happens
when
a
man
and
his
wife
do
contend
about
this
nevertheless
some
men
because
they
imagine
to
have
the
best
understanding
use
herein
a
very
hard
way
of
discourse
with
their
wives
making
it
all
their
business
to
snap
and
snarl
chide
and
bawl
nay
threaten
and
strike
also
which
indeed
rather
mars
then
mends
the
matter
little
thinking
that
quietness
in
a
family
is
such
a
costly
jewell
that
it
seldom
can
be
valued
others
on
the
contrary
take
their
greatest
delight
when
they
know
how
with
affableness
to
please
their
wives
humour
and
with
plausible
words
can
admonish
them
what
is
best
and
fittest
to
be
done
and
rather
to
extoll
those
graces
which
are
found
in
them
than
to
reprove
their
deficiencies
according
to
the
instructions
of
the
prudent
emperor
marcus
aurelius
who
said
that
men
ought
often
to
admonish
their
wives
seldom
reprove
them
and
never
strike
them
but
many
men
whose
understanding
is
turned
topsie
turvy
in
their
brains
seek
it
in
a
contrary
place
and
where
the
bank
is
lowest
the
water
breaks
in
soonest
in
such
case
the
women
suffer
cruelly
for
if
he
be
he
is
not
ashamed
openly
before
his
servants
and
other
people
to
check
curb
and
controul
his
wife
lustily
and
when
they
are
in
private
together
reprehends
her
so
bitterly
that
he
would
not
dare
to
mention
it
in
the
ears
of
honest
people
because
having
seen
that
his
border
out
of
meer
civility
cut
many
times
the
best
peece
at
table
and
presented
to
his
wife
bilds
thereupon
a
foundation
of
jealousie
and
an
undoubted
familiarity
which
he
privately
twits
her
in
the
teeth
with
though
in
publick
he
is
ashamed
to
let
it
appear
that
he
is
jealous
because
then
he
would
be
laught
at
for
it
therefore
he
doth
nothing
but
pout
mumble
bawl
scold
is
and
troubled
at
every
thing
nay
looks
upon
his
wife
and
all
the
rest
of
his
family
like
a
welsh
goat
none
of
them
knowing
the
least
reason
in
the
world
for
it
in
the
meanwhile
he
useth
all
possible
means
privately
to
attrap
his
wife
for
to
see
that
which
he
never
will
see
and
at
which
he
is
so
divellishly
possessed
to
have
a
wicked
revenge
nay
which
he
also
never
can
see
though
he
had
a
whole
boxfull
of
spectacles
upon
his
nose
because
she
never
hath
or
ever
will
give
him
the
least
reason
for
it
in
that
manner
violating
loves
knot
and
laying
a
foundation
of
implacable
hatred
verily
if
a
woman
be
a
little
and
merry
humoured
it
is
a
great
delight
and
pleasure
for
her
to
be
taking
notice
and
every
way
to
be
scoffing
with
all
the
foolish
tricks
and
devices
of
such
a
jealous
coxcomb
but
otherwise
there
is
no
greater
hell
upon
earth
then
for
an
honest
woman
to
dwell
with
a
jealous
husband
because
in
his
absence
she
dare
not
in
the
least
speak
to
any
one
and
in
his
presence
hardly
look
upon
any
body
this
is
known
to
those
who
have
had
experience
of
it
and
it
never
went
well
with
any
family
where
this
damned
ever
got
an
entrance
is
true
all
men
are
not
defiled
with
this
dirtiness
but
such
loggerheads
many
times
occasion
through
their
wicked
folly
and
evill
doings
that
the
woman
who
before
never
thought
of
jealousie
now
begins
to
grow
jealous
her
self
for
she
considering
that
her
husband
is
so
without
any
ground
or
reason
looks
so
sour
and
and
alwaies
when
he
comes
home
every
thing
stands
in
his
way
besides
that
the
soothings
and
friendly
entertainments
should
differ
so
much
from
those
of
former
times
and
especially
from
them
of
the
first
year
can
not
imagine
that
the
small
gain
and
the
bad
times
are
the
occasion
of
it
therefore
she
thinks
that
there
is
some
other
fine
gipsie
that
puts
him
on
to
these
base
humors
or
that
he
is
led
away
by
some
or
other
charming
punk
and
it
is
no
wonder
because
coming
home
lately
he
said
that
somewhere
as
he
was
walking
home
he
had
lost
his
watch
which
he
had
just
as
he
was
coming
out
of
the
tavern
and
two
or
three
weeks
before
came
home
without
his
cloak
saying
that
some
wicked
rascals
had
taken
it
from
him
in
the
streets
moreover
she
rememorates
how
he
related
not
long
since
that
he
had
been
out
of
jest
one
evening
with
three
or
four
others
in
six
of
the
most
vile
and
wickedest
bawdy
houses
in
the
city
though
that
he
had
committed
nothing
unhandsom
there
as
he
said
therefore
she
thinks
that
she
hath
more
reason
to
suspect
his
evil
doings
then
he
hath
of
hers
and
having
pondered
upon
all
these
things
this
and
way
imagineth
that
she
hath
a
great
deal
of
reason
to
suspect
him
nay
the
daily
grumbling
and
mumbling
the
lessening
of
the
mony
his
coming
home
late
at
nights
his
cool
kindness
besides
all
the
rest
seem
to
be
sufficient
proofs
so
that
here
the
pleasure
of
marriage
is
so
monstrously
clouded
as
if
there
were
a
great
eclipse
of
the
sun
and
it
will
be
a
wonder
to
see
with
what
kind
of
colour
it
will
appear
again
for
the
husband
catechizes
his
wife
with
such
a
loud
voice
that
it
is
generally
heard
through
the
whole
neighbourhood
and
the
wife
to
vindicate
her
innocency
lets
fly
at
him
again
with
such
a
shrill
note
as
if
she
had
gone
to
school
to
learn
it
in
drury
lane
or
turnball
street
and
it
is
a
wonder
that
the
first
chyrurgian
is
not
sent
for
to
cure
this
woman
of
her
bad
tongue
here
you
ought
to
come
o
restless
lovers
to
behold
your
selves
in
these
two
darlings
you
who
in
your
wooing
are
also
possessed
with
jealousie
if
you
see
that
another
obtains
access
to
your
mistriss
or
who
perhaps
as
wel
as
you
doth
but
once
kiss
the
knocker
of
the
dore
or
cause
an
aubade
to
be
plaied
under
her
chamber
window
look
sharply
about
you
and
behold
how
these
aubades
decline
or
whether
it
be
worth
your
while
to
give
your
rival
the
challenge
or
to
stab
poison
or
drown
your
self
to
shew
by
such
an
untimely
death
the
love
you
had
for
her
and
on
your
grave
bear
this
epitaph
that
through
damn
jealousie
you
murthered
your
self
these
married
couple
used
to
do
so
but
see
now
what
a
sad
life
they
live
together
because
jealousie
took
root
in
them
so
soon
and
now
bringeth
forth
such
evill
fruits
oh
that
this
now
senceless
married
couple
had
here
like
the
athenians
prudent
umpires
how
easily
might
they
perhaps
be
united
and
pacified
for
the
athenians
had
constituted
a
certain
sort
of
superiors
whom
they
intituled
pacificators
of
the
married
people
whose
power
was
to
appease
all
differences
between
married
people
and
to
constrain
them
that
they
must
live
in
peace
and
unity
with
each
other
in
like
manner
at
rome
a
temple
was
built
where
scolding
married
people
being
reunited
came
to
sacrifice
and
to
live
in
better
tranquility
but
alas
it
is
now
clear
contrary
such
contentious
couples
use
all
the
means
and
indeavours
they
possibly
can
rather
to
be
divorced
then
reunited
to
that
end
solliciting
both
the
majestical
and
ecclesiastical
powers
to
whom
are
related
a
thousand
sad
reasons
by
each
party
because
either
of
them
pretendeth
to
have
the
greatest
reason
on
their
side
of
which
this
age
imparteth
us
several
examples
wherewith
the
magistracy
ministry
and
elders
find
no
small
trouble
especially
if
they
be
people
of
a
brave
extraction
good
credit
and
reputation
who
have
procreated
severall
children
together
for
this
jealous
and
contentious
house
divell
domineers
as
well
among
people
of
great
respect
as
those
of
lesser
degree
though
there
be
some
which
so
order
it
that
they
smother
this
fire
within
dores
and
suffer
it
not
to
burst
out
at
the
house
top
nevertheless
it
is
impossible
to
hide
this
unkindness
from
the
eys
of
them
that
are
in
the
family
therefore
it
is
to
be
admired
that
the
sister
who
dwelleth
with
this
married
couple
and
seeth
and
hears
all
this
unkindness
mumbling
and
grumbling
yet
hath
such
an
earnest
desire
to
be
set
down
in
the
list
of
the
great
company
nay
though
she
had
read
all
the
twenty
pleasures
of
marriage
through
and
through
and
finds
by
the
example
of
her
brother
that
they
are
all
truth
yet
she
is
like
a
fish
never
at
rest
till
she
gets
her
self
into
the
where
she
knows
that
she
never
can
get
out
again
according
to
these
following
verses
which
she
hath
sung
so
many
times
may
in
sea
lanch
when
you
will
to
see
the
boistrous
main
great
storms
and
wind
your
sails
will
fill
fore
you
return
again
the
married
state
is
much
like
this
with
many
crosses
yet
must
be
born
see
how
it
is
with
tauntings
toils
and
but
i
beleeve
that
the
sister
makes
flesh
and
blood
her
counsellors
just
as
her
brother
did
who
hath
now
totally
forgotten
these
verses
for
since
the
flesh
is
almost
come
to
the
very
bone
all
his
designs
and
indeavours
seem
to
bend
now
to
the
being
separated
from
bed
and
table
and
if
fortune
would
favour
it
he
would
rather
see
it
done
by
death
then
any
civil
authority
for
then
he
might
look
out
again
for
a
new
beloved
and
by
that
means
get
another
new
portion
though
it
might
lightly
happen
to
be
some
mendicant
for
a
reward
of
his
jealousie
and
perhaps
he
little
thinks
how
that
bawling
and
scolding
between
him
and
his
wife
is
spread
abroad
but
it
hath
often
hapned
that
those
who
would
be
separated
very
unexpectedly
have
been
parted
by
death
but
not
so
neither
that
they
who
most
desired
the
separation
have
just
remained
alive
happy
were
those
restless
souls
if
they
did
like
the
wise
and
prudent
chyrurgians
who
will
not
cut
off
any
member
before
they
have
made
an
operation
of
all
imaginable
means
for
cure
and
recovery
thereof
and
that
they
first
learnt
to
know
their
own
deficiences
perfectly
that
they
might
the
better
excuse
those
of
their
adversary
o
how
thrice
happy
are
our
couple
who
like
a
for
all
others
live
together
in
love
pleasure
and
tranquility
and
have
banished
that
monstrous
beast
jealousie
out
of
their
hearts
and
house
wishing
nothing
more
then
to
live
long
together
and
to
dy
both
at
one
time
that
neither
of
them
both
might
inherit
that
grief
to
be
the
longest
liver
by
missing
their
these
do
recommend
marriage
in
the
highest
degree
to
the
whole
world
as
the
noblest
state
and
condition
and
despise
the
folly
of
those
who
reject
it
imagining
in
themselves
that
they
have
more
knowledge
and
understanding
then
all
the
wise
men
of
greece
ever
had
who
by
their
marrying
demonstrated
that
they
esteemed
the
married
estate
to
be
the
best
and
commendablest
though
some
of
them
were
married
to
women
who
notably
bore
the
sway
we
may
very
well
then
contemn
the
chattering
of
epicurus
that
pleasurable
hoggrubber
who
said
that
no
wise
man
would
ever
give
himself
in
to
the
bands
of
matrimony
because
there
is
so
much
grief
trouble
and
misery
to
be
found
in
it
for
we
see
to
the
contrary
that
the
wise
men
long
to
be
in
it
and
that
the
sun
of
understanding
appears
more
gloriously
in
them
when
it
is
nourisht
and
inlivened
by
marriage
especially
if
they
have
got
like
unto
our
couple
good
matches
to
this
end
all
those
that
are
unmarried
ought
to
look
very
circumspectly
for
the
getting
themselves
such
a
that
they
would
never
desire
to
part
with
and
for
the
exhortation
of
every
one
to
this
i
will
break
off
and
conclude
with
that
faithfull
warning
given
by
that
great
emperor
and
philosopher
marcus
aurelius
saying
the
life
of
man
can
not
remain
without
women
i
do
warn
the
young
pray
the
old
admonish
the
wise
and
teach
the
simple
that
they
should
shun
women
as
much
as
the
plague
for
i
say
that
all
the
venemous
creatures
in
the
world
have
not
so
much
poison
spread
or
contained
in
their
whole
bodies
as
one
woman
alone
hath
in
her
the
end
of
the
second
part
of
the
ten
pleasures
of
marriage
