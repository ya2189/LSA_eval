pantheism
not
sectarian
or
even
racial
pantheism
differs
from
the
systems
of
belief
constituting
the
main
religions
of
the
world
in
being
comparatively
free
from
any
limits
of
period
climate
or
race
for
while
what
we
roughly
call
the
egyptian
religion
the
vedic
religion
the
greek
religion
buddhism
and
others
of
similar
fame
have
been
necessarily
local
and
temporary
pantheism
has
been
for
the
most
part
a
dimly
discerned
background
an
esoteric
significance
of
many
or
all
religions
rather
than
a
denomination
by
itself
the
best
illustration
of
this
characteristic
of
pantheism
is
the
catholicity
of
its
great
prophet
spinoza
for
he
felt
so
little
antagonism
to
any
christian
sect
that
he
never
urged
any
member
of
a
church
to
leave
it
but
rather
encouraged
his
humbler
friends
who
sought
his
advice
to
make
full
use
of
such
spiritual
privileges
as
they
appreciated
most
he
could
not
indeed
content
himself
with
the
fragmentary
forms
of
any
sectarian
creed
but
in
the
few
writings
which
he
made
some
effort
to
adapt
to
the
popular
understanding
he
seems
to
think
it
possible
that
the
faith
of
pantheism
might
some
day
leaven
all
religions
alike
i
shall
endeavour
briefly
to
sketch
the
story
of
that
faith
and
to
suggest
its
significance
for
the
future
but
first
we
must
know
what
it
means
sidenote
meaning
of
pantheism
sidenote
god
is
all
sidenote
but
not
everything
is
god
sidenote
analogy
of
the
human
organism
pantheism
then
being
a
term
derived
from
two
greek
words
signifying
all
and
god
suggests
to
a
certain
extent
its
own
meaning
thus
if
atheism
be
taken
to
mean
a
denial
of
the
being
of
god
pantheism
is
its
extreme
opposite
because
pantheism
declares
that
there
is
nothing
but
god
this
however
needs
explanation
for
no
pantheist
has
ever
held
that
is
god
any
more
than
a
teacher
of
physiology
in
enforcing
on
his
students
the
unity
of
the
human
organism
would
insist
that
every
toe
and
finger
is
the
man
but
such
a
teacher
at
least
in
these
days
would
almost
certainly
warn
his
pupils
against
the
notion
that
the
man
can
be
really
divided
into
limbs
or
organs
or
faculties
or
even
into
soul
and
body
indeed
he
might
without
affectation
adopt
the
language
of
a
much
controverted
creed
so
far
as
to
pronounce
that
the
reasonable
soul
and
flesh
is
one
man
one
altogether
in
this
view
the
man
is
the
unity
of
all
organs
and
faculties
but
it
does
not
in
the
least
follow
that
any
of
these
organs
or
faculties
or
even
a
selection
of
them
is
the
man
sidenote
the
analogy
imperfect
but
useful
if
i
apply
this
analogy
to
an
explanation
of
the
above
definition
of
pantheism
as
the
theory
that
there
is
nothing
but
god
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
regard
the
parallelism
as
perfect
in
fact
one
purpose
of
the
following
exposition
will
be
to
show
why
and
where
all
such
analogies
fail
for
pantheism
does
not
regard
man
or
any
organism
as
a
true
unity
in
the
view
of
pantheism
the
only
real
unity
is
god
but
without
any
inconsistency
i
may
avail
myself
of
common
impressions
to
correct
a
common
thus
those
who
hold
that
the
reasonable
soul
and
flesh
is
one
man
one
altogether
but
at
the
same
time
deny
that
the
toe
or
the
finger
or
the
stomach
or
the
heart
is
the
man
are
bound
in
consistency
to
recognise
that
if
pantheism
affirms
god
to
be
all
in
all
it
does
not
follow
that
pantheism
must
hold
a
man
or
a
tree
or
a
tiger
to
be
god
sidenote
farther
definition
excluding
then
such
an
apparently
plausible
but
really
fallacious
inversion
of
the
pantheistic
view
of
the
universe
i
repeat
that
the
latter
is
the
precise
opposite
of
atheism
so
far
from
tolerating
any
doubt
as
to
the
being
of
god
it
denies
that
there
is
anything
else
for
all
objects
of
sense
and
thought
including
individual
consciousness
whether
directly
observed
in
ourselves
or
inferred
as
existing
in
others
are
according
to
pantheism
only
facets
of
an
infinite
unity
which
is
altogether
one
in
a
sense
inapplicable
to
anything
else
because
that
unity
is
not
merely
the
aggregate
of
all
the
finite
objects
which
we
observe
or
infer
but
is
a
living
whole
expressing
itself
in
infinite
variety
of
that
infinite
variety
our
gleams
of
consciousness
are
infinitesimal
parts
but
not
parts
in
a
sense
involving
any
real
division
the
questions
raised
by
such
a
view
of
the
universe
many
of
them
unanswerable
as
is
also
the
case
with
questions
raised
by
every
other
view
of
the
universe
will
be
considered
further
on
all
that
i
am
trying
to
secure
in
these
preliminary
observations
is
a
general
idea
of
the
pantheistic
view
of
the
universe
as
distinguished
from
that
of
polytheism
monotheism
or
atheism
sidenote
various

spurious

sidenote
exclusion
of

sidenote

and

applicable
only
to
parts
not
to
the
whole
of
course
there
have
been
different
forms
of
pantheism
as
there
have
been
also
various
phases
of
monotheism
and
in
the
brief
historical
review
which
will
follow
this
introductory
explanation
of
the
name
i
shall
note
at
least
the
most
important
of
those
forms
but
any
which
fail
to
conform
to
the
general
definition
here
given
will
not
be
recognised
as
pantheism
at
all
though
they
may
be
worth
some
attention
as
approximations
thereto
for
any
view
of
the
universe
allowing
the
existence
of
anything
outside
the
divine
unity
denies
that
god
is
all
in
all
and
therefore
is
obviously
not
pantheism
whether
we
should
recognise
as
true
pantheism
any
theory
involving
the
evolution
of
a
finite
world
or
worlds
out
of
the
divine
substance
at
some
definite
epoch
or
epochs
may
be
a
debatable
question
provided
that
the
eternity
and
inviolability
of
the
divine
oneness
is
absolutely
guarded
in
thought
yet
i
will
anticipate
so
far
as
to
say
that
in
my
view
the
question
must
be
negatived
at
any
rate
we
must
exclude
all
creeds
which
tolerate
the
idea
of
a
creation
in
the
popular
sense
of
the
word
or
of
a
final
catastrophe
true
the
individual
objects
great
or
small
from
a
galaxy
to
a
moth
which
have
to
us
apparently
a
separate
existence
have
all
been
evolved
out
of
preceding
modes
of
being
by
a
process
which
seems
to
us
to
involve
a
beginning
and
to
ensure
an
end
but
in
the
view
of
pantheism
properly
the
transference
of
such
a
process
to
the
whole
universe
is
the
result
of
an
illusion
suggested
by
false
analogy
for
the
processes
called
evolution
though
everywhere
operative
affect
each
of
them
only
parts
of
the
infinite
whole
of
things
and
experience
can
not
possibly
afford
any
justification
for
supposing
that
they
affect
the
universe
itself
thus
the
matter
or
energy
of
which
we
think
we
consist
was
in
existence
every
atom
of
it
and
every
element
of
force
before
we
were
born
and
will
survive
our
apparent
death
and
the
same
thing
at
least
on
the
pantheistic
view
is
true
of
every
other
mode
of
apparently
separate
or
finite
existence
therefore
no
birth
of
a
new
nebula
ever
added
a
grain
of
matter
or
an
impulse
of
new
energy
to
the
universe
and
the
final
decease
of
our
solar
system
if
such
an
event
be
in
prospect
can
not
make
any
difference
whatever
to
the
infinite
balance
of
forces
of
which
speaking
in
anthropomorphic
and
inadequate
language
we
suppose
the
eternal
all
to
consist
sidenote
limitation
of
scope
these
observations
are
not
intended
to
be
controversial
but
only
to
make
clear
the
general
sense
in
which
the
term
pantheism
is
here
used
not
that
it
would
be
possible
at
the
outset
to
indicate
all
that
is
implicit
in
the
definition
i
only
wish
to
premise
plainly
that
i
am
not
concerned
with
any
view
of
the
world
such
as
implies
or
admits
that
whether
by
process
of
creation
or
emanation
or
or
evolution
the
oneness
of
the
eternal
has
ever
been
marred
or
anything
other
than
the
being
of
god
has
been
or
can
be
produced

as

entirely
modern
sidenote
mystics
not
necessarily
pantheist
but
before
passing
on
to
the
promised
historical
review
it
is
perhaps
necessary
to
refer
again
to
a
remark
previously
made
that
pantheism
may
be
considered
either
from
the
point
of
view
of
philosophy
or
from
that
of
religion
not
that
the
two
points
of
view
are
mutually
exclusive
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
pantheism
as
a
religion
is
with
certain
exceptions
among
indian
saints
and
later
neoplatonists
almost
entirely
a
modern
development
of
which
spinoza
was
the
first
distinct
and
devout
teacher
for
this
statement
justification
will
be
given
hereafter
meantime
to
deprecate
adverse
prejudice
i
may
suggest
that
a
careful
study
of
the
most
ancient
forms
of
pantheism
seems
to
show
that
they
were
purely
philosophical
an
endeavour
to
reach
in
thought
the
ultimate
reality
which
polytheism
travestied
and
which
the
senses
disguised
but
little
or
no
attempt
was
made
to
substitute
the
contemplation
of
the
eternal
for
the
worship
of
mediator
divinities
thus
in
the
same
spirit
in
which
socrates
ordered
the
sacrifice
of
a
cock
to
aesculapius
for
his
recovery
from
the
disease
of
mortal
life
philosophical
pantheists
whether
egyptian
or
greek
or
even
indian
satisfied
their
religious
instincts
by
hearty
communion
with
the
popular
worship
of
traditional
gods
or
if
it
is
thought
that
the
mediaeval
mystics
were
religious
pantheists
a
closer
examination
of
their
devout
utterances
will
show
that
though
they
approximated
to
pantheism
and
even
used
language
such
as
if
interpreted
logically
must
have
implied
it
yet
they
carefully
reserved
articles
of
the
ecclesiastical
creed
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
fundamental
position
that
there
is
nothing
but
god
indeed
their
favourite
comparison
of
creature
life
to
the
ray
of
a
candle
is
not
really
a
pantheistic
conception
because
to
the
true
pantheist
the
creature
is
not
an
emanation
external
to
god
but
a
finite
mode
of
infinite
being
still
the
mystics
did
much
to
prepare
the
devout
for
an
acceptance
of
spinoza
teaching
and
although
so
amazing
a
transfiguration
of
religion
rather
dazzled
than
convinced
the
world
at
first
nay
though
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
one
and
perhaps
more
of
spinoza
fundamental
conceptions
have
increasingly
repelled
rather
than
attracted
religious
people
yet
it
can
hardly
be
disputed
that
he
gave
an
impulse
to
contemplative
religion
of
which
the
effect
is
only
now
beginning
to
be
fully
realised

if
buddha
occurs
to
the
reader
it
should
be
remembered
that
he

chapter
i
pantheism
sidenote
its
origins
doubtful
and
unimportant
sidenote
the
secret
of
pantheism
is
within
us
it
has
been
the
customary
and
perhaps
inevitable
method
of
writers
on
pantheism
to
trace
its
main
idea
back
to
the
dreams
of
vedic
poets
the
musings
of
egyptian
priests
and
the
speculations
of
the
greeks
but
though
it
is
undeniable
that
the
divine
unity
of
all
being
was
an
almost
necessary
issue
of
earliest
human
thought
upon
the
many
and
the
one
yet
the
above
method
of
treating
pantheism
is
to
some
extent
misleading
and
therefore
caution
is
needed
in
using
it
for
the
revival
of
pantheism
at
the
present
day
is
much
more
a
tangible
resultant
of
action
and
reaction
between
science
and
religion
than
a
ghost
conjured
up
by
speculation
thus
religious
belief
driven
out
from
the
darkness
and
the
cloud
of
sinai
takes
refuge
in
the
mystery
of
matter
and
if
the
glory
passes
from
the
mount
of
transfiguration
it
is
because
it
expands
to
etherialise
the
whole
world
as
the
garment
of
god
again
the
evanescence
of
the
atom
into
galaxies
of
electrons
destroys
the
only
physical
theory
that
ever
threatened
us
with
atheism
and
the
infinitesimal
electrons
themselves
open
up
an
immeasurable
perspective
into
the
abyss
of
an
unknowable
in
which
all
things
live
and
move
and
have
their
being
therefore
it
matters
little
to
us
except
as
a
matter
of
antiquarian
interest
to
know
what
the
vedic
singers
may
have
dreamed
or
what
thales
or
xenophanes
or
parmenides
may
have
thought
about
the
first
principle
of
things
or
about
the
many
and
the
one
for
our
spiritual
genealogy
is
not
from
them
but
from
a
nearer
and
double
line
of
begetters
including
seers
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
and
saints
for
both

by
kepler
and
hooker
newton
and
jeremy
taylor
descartes
and
spinoza
leibnitz
and
wesley
spencer
and
newman
and
even
these
have
authority
not
through
any
divine
right
of
genius
or
acquired
claim
of
learning
but
because
they
illumine
and
interpret
obscure
suggestions
of
our
own
thoughts
indeed
to
the
sacrament
of
historic
communion
with
the
past
as
well
as
to
the
chief
rite
of
the
church
the
apostolic
injunction
is
applicable
let
a
man
examine
himself
and
so
let
him
eat
of
that
bread
sidenote
suggestions
of
nature
obeying
that
injunction
any
man
possessing
ordinary
powers
of
observation
and
reflection
may
in
the
course
of
a
summer
day
walk
find
abundant
reason
for
interest
in
the
speculations
of
historic
pantheism
for
the
aspect
of
nature
then
presented
to
him
is
one
both
of
movement
and
repose
of
variety
and
harmony
of
multiplicity
and
unity
thus
the
slight
breeze
scarcely
stirring
the
drowsy
flowery
the
monotonous
cadences
of
the
stony
brook
and
the
gliding
of
feathery
flecks
of
cloud
across
the
blue
create
a
peace
far
deeper
than
absolute
stillness
and
suggest
an
infinite
life
in
which
activity
and
repose
are
one
besides
there
is
evident
everywhere
an
interplay
of
forces
acting
and
reacting
so
as
mutually
to
help
and
fulfil
one
another
for
instance
the
falling
leaves
give
back
the
carbon
they
gathered
from
the
air
and
so
repay
the
soil
with
interest
for
the
subtler
essences
derived
therefrom
and
dissolved
in
the
sap
the
bees
again
humming
among
the
flowers
while
actuated
only
by
instincts
of
appetite
and
thrift
fructify
the
blooms
and
become
a
connecting
link
between
one
vegetable
generation
and
another
the
heat
of
the
sun
draws
up
water
from
ocean
and
river
and
lake
while
chilly
currents
of
higher
air
return
it
here
and
there
in
rain
so
earth
sea
and
air
are
for
ever
trafficking
together
and
their
interchange
of
riches
and
force
is
complicated
ten
thousandfold
by
the
activities
of
innumerable
living
things
all
adapting
themselves
by
some
internal
energy
to
the
ever
varying
balance
of
heat
and
cold
moisture
and
drought
light
and
darkness
chemical
action
and
reaction
and
all
this
has
been

it
may
well
occur
to
anyone
to
think
with
interest
and
sympathy
of
the
poets
and
seers
who
thousands
of
years
ago
first
dared
to
discern
in
this
maze
of
existence
the
varied
expression
of
one
and
eternal
life
or
power
such
contemplations
and
speculations
were
entirely
uninfluenced
by
anything
which
the
christian
church
recognises
as
revelation
yet
we
must
not
on
that
account
suppose
that
they
were
without
religion
or
pretended
to
explain
anything
without
reference
to
superhuman
beings
called
gods
and
demons
on
the
contrary
they
for
the
most
part
shared
subject
to
such
modifications
as
were
imperatively
required
by
cultivated
common
sense
the
beliefs
of
their
native
land
but
the
difference
between
these
men
and
their
unthinking
contemporaries
lay
in
this
that
the
former
conceived
of
one
supreme
and
comprehensive
divinity
beyond
the
reach
of
common
thought
an
ultimate
and
eternal
being
which
included
gods
as
well
as
nature
within
its
unity
so
for
them
indra

or
jove
were
mere
modes

sidenote
the

and

every
race
possessing
even
the
rudiments
of

has
been
impelled
by
a
happy
instinct
which
if
we
like
we
may
call
inspiration
to
record
in
more
or
less
permanent
form
its
experience
of
nature
of
life
and
of
what
seemed

mysteries
of
both
to
this
inspiration
we
owe
the
sacred
books
of
the
jews
but
it
is
now
generally

that
an
impulse
not
wholly
dissimilar
also
moved
prophetic
or
poetic
minds

other
races

for
instance
as
the
egyptians
the
chaldaeans
and

considerable

is
taken
up
by
the

involved
in
life

and

most
notably
is
this
the
case
with
the
ancient
indian
literature
called
the
vedas
and
such
sequels
as
the
upanishads
sutras
and
much
later
the
bhagavad

this
collection

our

various
dates
extending
over
much
more
than
a
thousand
years
sidenote
indian
pantheism
the
forgotten
singers
and
preachers
of
this
prehistoric

were
as
much
haunted
as
we
ourselves
are
with
the
harassing
questions
suggested
by
sin
and
sorrow
by
life
and
death
and
by
aspirations
after
a
higher
state
and
many
perhaps
we
may
say
most
of
them
found
comfort
in
the
thought
that
essentially
they
belonged
to
an
all
comprehensive
and
infinite
life
in
which
if
they
acted
purely
and
nobly
their
seeming
personality
might
be
merged
and
find
peace
their
frame
of
mind
was
religious
rather
than
philosophical
but
their
philosophy
was
naturally
conformed
to
it
and
in
their
contrast
of
the
bewildering
variety
of
finite
visible
things
with
the
unity
of
the
eternal
being
of
which
all
are
phases
those
ancients
were
in
close
sympathy
with
the
thoughts
of
the
modern
meditative
saunterer
by
field
and
river
and

sidenote
differences
between
ancient
and
modern
conditions
of
thought
but
the
enormous
interval
of
time
separating
us
from
those
early
indian
thinkers
necessarily
involves
very
great
differences
in
conditions
of
thought
and
we
should
not
be
surprised
if
amidst
much
in
their
writings
that
stirs
our
sympathy
there
is
also
a
great
deal
which
is
to
us
incongruous
and
absurd
therefore
it
may
be
well
before
quoting
these
writings
to
note
one
or
two
points
marking
an
almost
incommensurable
difference
between
their
mode
and
ours
of
regarding
the
world
sidenote
survival
in
their
day
of
fetishistic
and
animistic
ideas
first
they
were
much
less
removed
than
we
are
from
the
influence
of
fetishistic
and
animistic
traditions
even
in
the
greek
and
roman
classics
the
casual
reader
is
often
revolted
by
the
grossly
absurd
stories
told
of
gods
and
heroes
and
indeed
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
the
amours
of
zeus
or
jove
for
instance
with
leda
europa
or
danaë
as
having
been
first
conceived
during
an
age
marked
by
the
poetic
genius
and
comparative
culture
evinced
in
the
most
ancient
epics
but
the
most
probable
solution
of
the
puzzle
is
that
the
earliest
civilization
inherited
a
number
of
animal
stories
such
as
are
characteristic
of
savagery
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
that
the
first
literary
generations
into
whose
poetic
myths
those
stories
were
transferred
being
as
much
accustomed
to
them
as
to
other
surroundings
of
their
childhood
such
as
bloody
sacrifices
mystic
expiations
and
fantastic
initiations
saw
no
incongruity
in
anything
told
them
of
the
gods
besides
as
those
wild
myths
were
associated
with
sacred
rites
the
inveterate
conservatism
of
religion
which
insisted
on
stone
knives
in
sacrifices
long
after
bronze
and
iron
came
in
was
likely
enough
to
maintain
the
divine
importance
of
those
fables
just
as
the
historicity
of
balaam
ass
and
jonah
whale
is
in
some
churches
piously
upheld
still
sidenote
ancient
ignorance
of
natural
order
in
the
times
from
which
the
first
known
pantheistic
teaching
dates
ideas
of
nature
order
were
incongruous
and
indeed
incommensurable
with
ours
not
that
the
world
was
then
regarded
as
a
chaos
but
such
order
as
existed
was
considered
to
be
a
kind
of
balance
of
power
between
various
unseen
beings
some
good
some
evil
some
indifferent
true
some
indian
prophets
projected
an
idea
of
one
eternal
being
including
all
such
veiled
principalities
and
powers
but
their
pantheism
was
necessarily
conditioned
by
their
ignorance
of
natural
phenomena
in
fact
an
irreducible
inconsistency
marred
their
view
of
the
world
for
while
their
pantheism
should
have
taught
them
to
think
of
a
universal
life
or
energy
as
working
within
all
things
their
theological
habit
of
mind
bound
them
to
the
incongruous
notion
of
devils
or
deities
moulding
or
at
least
ruling
matter
from
without
and
indeed
the
nearest
approach
they
made
to
the
more
genuine
pantheism
of
modern
times
was
the
conception
of
a
world
emanating
from
and
projected
outside
brahma
to
be
in
him
after
the
lapse
of
ages
now
if
i
am
right
in
my
definition
of
pantheism
as
absolutely
identifying
god
with
the
universe
so
that
in
fact
there
can
not
be
anything
but
god
the
inconsistency
here
noted
must
be
regarded
as
fatal
to
the
genuineness
of
the
indian
or
indeed
of
any
other
ancient
pantheism
for
the
defect
proved
during
many
centuries
to
be
incurable
and
was
not
indeed
fully
removed
until
spinoza
time
sidenote
absence
of
definite
creeds
another
difference
between
ancient
pantheists
and
ourselves
was
the
absence
in
their
case
of
any
religious
creed
sanctioned
by
supernatural
authority
and
embodied
in
a
definite
form
like
that
of
the
three
anglican
creeds
or
the
westminster
confession
of
faith
not
that
those
ancients
supposed
themselves
to
be
without
a
revelation
for
the
vedas
at
least
were
considered
to
be
of
divine
authority
and
their
words
metres
and
grammar
were
regarded
with
a
superstitious
awe
such
as
reminds
us
of
what
has
been
called
the
bibliolatry
of
the
jewish
rabbis
but
subject
to
this
verbal
veneration
the
rishis
or
learned
divines
used
the
utmost
freedom
in
regard
to
the
forced
and
fanciful
interpretations
extorted
from
the
sacred
text
a
freedom
which
again
reminds
us
of
the
paradoxical
caprice
shown
by
some
schools
of
jewish
rabbis
in
their
treatment
of
the
volume
they
professed
to
regard
with
awe
the
various
finite
gods
such
as
vishnu
indra
krishna
marut
or
varuna
were
not
the
subjects
of
any
church
creed
chanted
every
day
and
carefully
stereotyped
in
the
tender
minds
of
children
on
the
contrary
various
rôles
were
assigned
by
successive
generations
to
these
divinities
so
that
for
instance
varuna
was
at
one
time
the
god
of
the
ocean
and
at
another
of
the
sky
but
the
uniform
tendency
of
all
poets
and
rishis
alike
was
to
seek
beyond
all
these
gods
one
unbeginning
unending
and
all
comprehensive
being
from
whom
these
devas
emerged
and
into
whom
they
must
return
not
only
so
but
it
is
clearly
suggested
in
many
passages
of
which
an
instance
will
presently
be
quoted
that
the
eternal
called
brahma
who
was
the
true
self
of
all
gods
was
also
the
true
self
of
man
and
bird
and
beast
so
that
in
fact
notwithstanding
the
illogical
emanation
theory
he
was
the
only
real
being
the
all
in
all
sidenote
illustration
from
the
upanishads
sidenote
monism
thus
one
section
of
the
khandogya
upanishad
consists
entirely
of
instructions
given
by
a
father
uddâlaka
to
his
son
svetaketu
who
had
gone
through
the
ordinary
courses
of
study
in
the
vedas
but
who
in
the
father
view
had
failed
to
reach
the
true
significance
of
life
accordingly
uddâlaka
inquires
have
you
ever
asked
for
that
instruction
by
which
we
hear
what
can
not
be
heard
by
which
we
perceive
what
can
not
be
perceived
by
which
we
know
what
can
not
be
known
the
youth
more
accustomed
than
we
are
to
teaching
by
paradox
expresses
no
surprise
at
this
mode
of
putting
things
but
simply
asks
what
is
that
instruction
sir
the
father
then
proceeds
to
give
an
explanation
of
what
in
these
days
is
called
monism
that
is
the
absolute
singleness
of
ultimate
being
and
traces
all
that
is
or
seems
to
be
up
to
one
ultimate
essence
now
whether
in
the
form
given
by
uddâlaka
to
his
exposition
his
theory
can
properly
be
called
pantheism
according
to
the
definition
of
it
assumed
above
is
perhaps
questionable
but
that
it
was
intended
to
be
pantheism
there
can
be
no
doubt
in
the
beginning
says
uddâlaka
there
was
that
only
which
is
greek
to
hon
one
only
without
a
second
others
say
in
the
beginning
there
was
that
only
which
is
not
greek
to
mae
hon
one
only
without
a
second
and
from
that
which
is
not
that
which
is
was
born
but
uddâlaka
rejects
this
latter
doctrine
as
unthinkable
which
indeed
many
explorers
of
hegel
have
found
with
pain
and
anguish
of
mind
and
then
the
father
traces
all
the
multiformity
of
the
universe
to
the
desire
or
will
of
the
original
one
that
which
is
sidenote
evolution
from
the
one
through
desire
it
thought
i
be
many
may
i
grow
forth
it
sent
forth
fire
my
limits
do
not
allow
me
to
quote
further
the
fantastic
account
given
of
the
farther
process
by
which
water
and
earth
plants
animals
and
men
sprang
out
of
that
desire
of
the
one
may
i
become
many
may
i
grow
forth
for
our
purpose
it
is
more
important
to
show
that
in
the
view
of
uddâlaka
however
inconsistently
he
may
express
himself
the
original
one
was
never
really
divided
but
remains
the
true
self
of
every
finite
being
however
apparently
separate
thus
consider
the
following

its
ablest

simply
ignored

and
this
not

because
its
aims
were

was
to

of

was
in

in

only
infinitesimal

with
the
thought
of

thus
true
pantheism
takes
the
universe
as
it
is
in
its
infinity
regards
it
as
without
beginning

and
worships
it
not
that
pantheism
denies
the
existence
of
evil
or
is
unmoved
by

struggle
between
evil
and
good
or
is
uninspired
by
faith
in
the
reiterated
triumph
of
good
wherever
the
local
conflict
arises
but
it
insists
that
evil
is
relative
to
the
finite
parts
of
the
universe
in
their
supposed
isolation
and
can
not
possibly
affect
the
eternal

allows
of

need
not
detain
us
for
though
there
are
clear
traces
of
pantheistic
speculation
among
the
priests
it
can
scarcely
be
contended
that
such
speculations
had
the
same
influence
on
the
cultured
laity
as
the
teaching
of
the
rishis
had
in
ancient
india
but
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
the
oldest
popular
theology
of
egypt
was
only
a
variety
of
negro
animism
and
fetishism
yet
these
grovelling
superstitions
as
is
often
the
case
evolved
in
unbroken
continuity
a
higher
faith
for
in
the
attempt
made
to
adapt
this
savage
cult
to
the
religious
needs
of
various
districts
all
alike
gradually
advancing
in
culture
the
number
and
variety
of
divinities
became
so
bewildering
to
the
priests
that
the
latter
almost
inevitably
adopted
the
device
of
recognising
in
parochial
gods
only
so
many
hints
of
one
divine
energy
not
that
they
ever
embraced
monotheism
or
the
belief
in
one
personal
god
distinct
from
the
universe
but
if
plutarch
be
accurate
as
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
in
his
record
of
an
inscription
in
a
temple
of
isis
they
or
at
least
the
most
spiritual
of
them
found
refuge
in
pantheism
for
the
transfigured
and
glorified
goddess
was
not
regarded
as
the
maker
of
the
universe
but
as
identical
with
it
and
therefore
unknowable
i
am
all
that
hath
been
is
or
shall
be
and
no
mortal
has
lifted
my
veil
the
prevalence
of
such
pantheism
at
least
among
the
learned
and
spiritual
of
ancient
egypt
is
to
a
considerable
extent
confirmed
by
other
greek
writers
besides
plutarch
but
the
inscription
noted
by
plutarch
gives
the
sum
and
substance
of
what
they
tell
us
sidenote
greek
pantheism
sidenote
evolved
from
polytheism
before
considering
the
classical
and
greek
speculations
commonly
regarded
as
pantheistic
we
may
do
well
to
recall
to
mind
the
immense
difference
between
the
established
habit
of
theological
thought
in
our
day
and
the
vague
or
at
best
poetically
vivid
ideas
of
the
ancients
for
the
long
tradition
of
nearly
two
thousand
years
which
has
made
monotheism
to
us
almost
as
fixed
an
assumption
as
that
of
our
own
individuality
was
entirely
wanting
in
this
case
not
that
the
idea
of
one
supreme
god
had
never
been
suggested
but
it
was
not
the
hebrew
or
christian
idea
that
was
occasionally
propounded
for
in
the
ethnic
mind
it
was
rarely
if
ever
regarded
as
inconsistent
with
polytheism
and
consequently
it
verged
on
pantheism
consequently
i
say
because
such
monotheism
as
existed
had
necessarily
to
explain
the
innumerable
minor
deities
as
emanations
from
or
manifestations
of
the
supreme
god
and
though
such
conscious
attempts
at
reconciliation
of
beliefs
in
many
gods
and
in
one
supreme
were
confined
to
a
small
minority
of
meditative
priests
and
speculative
philosophers
yet
really
the
combination
was
implicit
in
the
sort
of
polytheistic
religion
which
possessed
the
family
affections
and
patriotic
associations
of
the
early
greek
world
sidenote
not
the
material
figure
but
the
divinity
suggested
was
the
object
of
worship
for
though
we
may
find
a
difficulty
in
ridding
ourselves
of
a
prejudice
wrought
into
the
tissue
of
our
early
faith
by
the
nursery
lessons
of
childhood
it
was
not
the
graven
or
molten
image
which
was
really
worshipped
by
the
devout
but
that
form
of
superhuman
power
which
by
local
accident
had
been
identified
with
the
idol
if
indeed
we
supposed
every
idolator
to
have
received
definite
religious
teaching
analogous
to
that
with
which
we
ourselves
were
imbued
in
youth
we
might
well
find
his
attitude
inconceivable
but
he
had
nothing
of
the
kind
he
only
knew
that
in
war
in
hunting
in
fishing
in
farming
he
was
confronted
with
powers
which
passed
his
comprehension
and
tradition
permeated
him
with
the
expectation
that
such
powers
would
be
propitiated
by
his
worship
of
the
images
set
up
in
their
names
there
was
therefore
no
reasoned
creed
such
as
those
of
the
catholic
and
reformed
churches
but
only
a
vague
sentiment
brought
to
a
focus
by
the
associations
of
the
shrine
from
such
a
view
of
polytheism
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
most
if
not
all
of
the
old
speculative
philosophers
could
allow
the
existence
of
the
traditional
gods
even
while
in
reasoned
contemplation
they
saw
that
all
deities
were
subordinate
to
and
merged
in
one
universal
god
sidenote
possible
influence
of
oriental
pantheism
how
far
this
unstable
religious
position
was
subject
to
the
influence
of
the
oriental
mysticism
at
which
we
have
glanced
already
is
at
any
rate
so
far
as
concerns
the
classical
age
of
greek
philosophy
a
matter
of
conjecture
but
the
resurrection
of
a
prehistoric
and
almost
forgotten
civilization
from
the
buried
cities
of
crete
has
brought
to
light
many
evidences
of
frequent
intercourse
two
or
three
thousand
years
before
the
christian
era
between
european
and
egyptian
or
asiatic
centres
of
life
therefore
we
may
well
believe
that
during
the
earliest
stages
of
the
evolution
of
thought
in
east
and
west
it
was
as
impossible
as
at
the
present
time
for
any
local
school
of
thinkers
to
be
absolutely
original
or
independent
thus
later
greek
philosophers
whether
themselves
within
sound
of
the
echoes
of
hindoo
teaching
or
not
may
very
well
have
grown
up
in
an
atmosphere
impregnated
with
mythic
germs
whose
origin
they
did
not
know
but
however
that
may
be
greek
pantheism
while
it
had
many
points
of
contact
with
eastern
speculation
was
more
purely
intellectual
and
less
essentially
religious
than
the
pantheism
of
the
vedas
or
the
solemn
dream
that
haunted
egyptian
temples
for
while
the
aspiration
of
hindoo
pantheists
was
to
find

assume
the
right

of
the

found
in
water

the

out

all

a

we
are
here
not
concerned
except
to
say
that
it
was
not
pantheism
as
understood
in
modern
times
for
while
his
ablest
exponents
admit
that
no
sufficient
evidence
is
left
to
show
very
clearly
what
he
meant
there
seems
no
reason
for
supposing
that
to
him
the
universe
was
a
living
god
sidenote
successors
of
thales
it
would
be
fruitless
to
relate
how
successors
of
thales
varied
his
theory
of
an
ultimate
principle
by
substituting
air
or
fire
for
water
but
it
is
worth
while
to
note
that
another
citizen
of
miletus
anaximander
after
an
interval
of
some
forty
years
pronounced
that
the
beginning
the
first
principle
the
origin
of
all
things
was
neither
water
nor
air
nor
fire
but
the
infinite
greek

on
and
though
the
best
authorities
confess
that
they
can
not
be
sure
of
his
meaning
this
may
very
well
be
because
he
anticipated
herbert
spencer
by
two
and
a
half
millenniums
in
acknowledging
that
all
things
merge
in
one
and
the
same
unknowable
but
so
far
as
our
evidence
goes
he
made
no
such
attempt
as
the
modern
philosopher
did
to
persuade
the
religious
instinct
that
this
unknowable
could
supply
the

is

us
of

strongly
suggestive
of

interpretation
put
upon

by

and

had

appear

that
in
human

has

and

equally

throughout
his
infinite
essence
and
if
that
essence
is
compared
by
xenophanes
to
a
sphere
neither
bounded
nor
boundless
neither
moving
nor
immovable
this
is
only
because
few
if
any
in
that
age
of
the
world
could
content
themselves
with
loyally
accepting
the
limits
imposed
on
man

very
nature
of

which
now
compel
us
to
own
that

the

is
more
real
than
ourselves
yet
in
the
strict
sense
of
knowing
he
is
from
an
intellectual
standpoint
the
unknowable
sidenote
extent
of
his
sympathy
with
popular
religion
sidenote
a
pantheistic
communion

this
pantheism
did
not
generate
in
xenophanes
any
arrogant
disdain
for
the
religion
of
his
time

though
he
condemned
in
words
often
quoted
the
folly
which
supposed
the
gods
to
have
the
human
form

appetites
he
was
yet
glad
to
worship
the
divine

as
partially
manifested
in
finite
beings
perhaps
personified
powers
of
nature
thus
among
the
fragments
of
his
poetry
fortunately
preserved
is
one
exquisite
gem
a
description
of
a
festive
repast
in
the
open

there

comes
first
symbolised
by
clear

hands
and
spotless
dishes

purity

in
the
forms
desired
by

passion
but
in

of
flowers

in
delicate
scents

wine
is
unstinted
yet
tempered
with
sparkling
water
but
lest
the
plentifulness
of
bread
and
honey
and

table
should
eclipse
the
highest
sanctions
of
human
joy
an
altar
prominent
in
the
festive
scene
is
heaped
with

then
the
first
note
of
music
is
the
praise
of
god
a
praise
taking
form
in
blameless

holy
thoughts
in
such
a

be

very
few
lines

course

tradition
among
the
greeks
after
his
day

arithmetical
mysticism
of
pythagoras

no
bearing
upon
our
subject
empedocles
of
agrigentum
living
about
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
and
thus
perhaps
in
the
second
generation
after
xenophanes
was
in
many
respects
a
much
more
imposing
figure
clothed
in
purple
wielding
political
power
possessing
medical
skill
and
even
working
miraculous
cures
such
as
are
apparently
easy
to
men
of
personal
impressiveness
sympathy
and
magnetism
but
he
does
not
appear
to
have
so
nearly
anticipated
modern
pantheism
as
did
his
humbler
predecessor
for
though
the
fragments
of
empedocles
much
larger
in
volume
than
those
of
xenophanes
certainly
hint
at
some
kind
of
everlasting
oneness
in
things
and
expressly
tell
us
that
there
is
no
creation
nor
annihilation
but
only
perpetual
changes
of
arrangement
yet
they
present
other
phases
of
thought
apparently
irreconcileable
with
the
doctrine
that
there
is
nothing
other
than
god
thus
he
teaches
that
there
are
four
elements
earth
air
water
and
fire
out
of
which
all
things
are
generated
he
also
anticipates
lucretius
in
his
pessimistic
view
of
humanity
lot
and
insists
on
the
apparently
independent
existence
of
a
principle
of
discord
or
strife
in
the
universe
it
would
be
a
forced
interpretation
to
suppose
him
to
have
set
forth
precociously
the
darwinian
theory
of
the
struggle
for
life
for
his
notion
seems
much
more
akin
to
the
zoroastrian
imagination
of
ahriman
again
he
sings
melodiously
but
most
unphilosophically
of
a
former
golden
age
in
which
the
lion
and
the
lamb
would
seem
to
have
lain
down
together

still
it
must
be
remembered
that
whether
consistently
or
not
empedocles
produced
an
elaborate
work
on
the
nature
of
things
to
which
lucretius
makes
eloquent
and
earnest
acknowledgments
but
that
very
approval
of
lucretius
forbids
us
to
regard
the
older

as
a

he
regarded
the

as
an
emanation
from
the

and
the

the

world
as
in
some
way
emanating
from
the

perhaps
indeed
if
we
could
exclude
from
emanation
the

and

forbid
such

whether
he
regarded
matter
as
eternally
existing

looked
upon

followed
socrates

in
reverence
for
knowledge

begetter
of
virtue
but
their
speculations
about
the
divine
being
were
touched
by
oriental
emotion
and
we
may
with
some
confidence
believe
that
their
development
of
the
platonic
trinity
owed
a
good
deal
to
the
rapid
spread
of
christianity
thus
the
sentiment
the
fervour

yearning
for
salvation

worship

devotion
taught
by
the
best
of

not

from

and

though
there
were
in
their
many
anticipations
of
the
gospel
of
the
man
whom
the
counsels
of
the
eternal
reserved
for
the
fulness
of
times
it
would
scarcely
be
accurate
to
describe
the
system
of
any
of
them
as
strictly
pantheistic
for
they
were
always
troubled
about
matter
as
an
anomalous
thing
in
a
divine
universe
and
in
treating
of
it
they
hesitated
between
the
notion
of
an
eternal
nuisance
which
the
demiurgus
or
acting
god
could
only
modify
not
destroy
and
on
the
other
hand
a
strained
theory
of
an
evil
nothing
which
is
yet
something
again
so
far
from
realising
faith
in
god
as
so
literally
all
in
all
that
there
is
nothing
else
but
he
they
would
not
tolerate
the
contact
of
the
infinite
with
the
finite
of

with
the

consistently
with
such
prepossessions
they
held
obstinately
to
the
notion
of
some
beginning
and
therefore
some
ending
of
the
ordered
world
and
this
beginning
was
effected
by
emanations
such
as
the
logos
or
as
others
had
it
the
and
other
divine
energies
between
the
eternal
and
creation
a
phantasy
which
however
poetically
wrought
out
is
not
really
consistent
with
pantheism
sidenote
the
gnostics
such
ideas
of
a
hierarchy
of
subordinate
emanations
to
fill
the
supposed
abyss
between
the
infinite
and
the
finite
were
eagerly
adopted
and
developed
by
the
called
gnostics
on
both
sides
of
the
boundary
between
the
church
and
the
world
suffice
it
that
like
most
though
by
no
means
all
of
their
predecessors
they
regarded
the
world
of
earth
sun
planet
stars
and
animated
nature
with
man
at
its
head
as
the
whole
universe
and
assuming
that
it
must
have
had
a
beginning
they
vexed
their
souls
with
futile
attempts
to
frame
some
gradual
transition
from
the
uncreated
to
the
created
from
the
eternal
to
the
mortal
the
grotesque
chimaeras
engendered
thus
are
remembered
now
only
as
illustrations
of
the
facile
transition
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
and
from
philosophy
to
folly
sidenote
the
church
fathers
sidenote
augustine
the
orthodox
christian
fathers
were
not
less
conscious
than
the
or
gnostics
of
the
perennial
problem
of
the
many
and
the
one
but
they
were
restrained
perhaps
by
the
faith
that
comes
of
perhaps
by
mere
common
sense
from
indulging
in
attempts
to
connect
the
infinite
with
the
finite
by
vain
genealogies
indeed
for
the
most
part
they
confessed
that
whatever
light
the
gospel
might
shed
on
moral
issues
it
left
untouched
the
ultimate
question
of
the
relation
of
the
infinite
to
the
finite
and
the
only
aspect
of
their
most
venturesome
speculations
which
i
need
recall
is
their
insistence
even
when
apparently
verging
toward
pantheism
on
a
transcendent
as
well
as
an
immanent
god
that
is
on
a
creator
existing
so
to
speak
outside
the
universe
and
apart
from
it
as
well
as
permeating
every
part
thus
for
example
augustine
would
seem
to
deny
to
the
world
any
separate
creature
existence
when
he
says
that
but
for
the
divinity
everywhere
in
it
creation
would
cease
to
be
but
in
his
insistence
on
the
creation
of
the
world
from
nothing
he
directly
contradicts
pantheism
because
he
must
necessarily
be
taken
to
mean
that
there
is
now
something
other
than
god
that
there
have
been
devout
christians
whose
mystic
speculations
on
the
relations
of
the
soul
to
the
eternal
logically
involved
pantheism
if
logic
in
such
a
case
had
any
function
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
for
most
of
them
god
word
written
seemed
to
confirm
god
word
in
heaven
and
earth
as
known
to
them
proclaiming
that
there
had
been
a
beginning
and
there
must
be
an
end
therefore
whatever
might
be
the
immanence
of
the
creator
in
his
works
god
could
not
in
their
minds
be
identified
with
the
fashion
of
this
world
which
passeth
away
yet
the
time
was
coming
when
the
divine
word
both
in
scripture
and
in
nature
was
to
be
otherwise
read
for
men
began
to
learn
that
the

was
other
than

supposed

the

very
clearly
against

for
the

increasingly

satisfying
the

an
ever

for
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
spinoza
was
the
first
pantheist
who
was
also
a
prophet
in
the
sense
of
speaking
out
the
divine
voice
of
the
infinite

its
human

i
would

their
pantheism
that
seems
to
have
been
imperfect
but
in
spinoza
we
have
a
man
who
inheriting
by
birth
the
tradition
i
might
even
say
the
apostolic
succession
of
the
jewish
prophets
and
gifted
with
an
insight
into
the
consummation
of
that
tradition
in
jesus
christ
was
driven
by
a
commanding
intellect
to
divorce

he
prized
from

that
had
become
to
him
impossible
and
to
enshrine
it
in
the
worthier
temple
of
an
eternal

identical
with

he
himself
was
disposed
at

during

earlier
philosophical
development
to
exaggerate
his
indebtedness
to
the
philosopher
descartes
whose
system
he
laboriously

whatever
may
have
been
the
esoteric
belief
of
descartes
about

out
of
nothing
and
the
theological
dogmas
connected
therewith
he
attached
too
much
importance
to
the
social
and
political
functions
of
established
ecclesiastical
institutions
to
declare
himself
independent
of
them
and
though
his
submission
signalised
on
his
did
not
interfere
with
the
freest
working
of
his
brilliant
intellect
within
limits
permitted
to
the
former
ecclesiastical
schoolmen
it
did
prevent
his
frank
realization
of
the
eternal
oneness
of
all
being
for
it
compelled
him
to
retain
belief
in
a
creator
distinct
in

from

such
a
belief
spinoza
entirely
rejected
for

are

for
him
there
was
no

of
the

and
there
could
be
no

there
was
no
creation
out
of
nothing
nor
any

arising

or
of
the
mythical
engineer
who
digs
deep
in
the
darkness
to
lay
the
foundations
of
the
earth
for
that
is
poetry
appealing
by
concrete
images
to
the
emotions
but
it
does
not
bind
the
intellect
to
a
literal
interpretation
and
we
are
no
longer
tormented
by
vain
efforts
to
reconcile
with
infinite
impossibilities
the
personality
presented
in
poetic
guise
so
that
the
vision
of
the
seer
is
now
the
suggestion
to
us
of
an
infinite
and
eternal
being
whose
attributes
by
modification
take
the
innumerable
shapes
of
sun
moon
and
stars
and
mountains
and
river
and
tree
and
flower
and
bird
and
beast
and
man
and
the
winds
that
sweep
and
the
floods
that
roll
and
the
rocky
barriers
that
stand
fast
and
the
rivers
that
wind
among
the
hills
and
the
trees
that
flourish
and
the
living
societies
that
gather
in
fruitful
places
the
labourer
in
his
vineyard
the
sailor
in
his
ship
all
are
in
and
of
the
one
eternal
being
yet
we
echo
not
with
less
but
perhaps
with
more
reverence
than
the
believers
in
a
divine
artisan
the
words
of
the
psalmist
o
lord
how
manifold
are
thy
works
in
wisdom
hast
thou
made
them
all
the
earth
is
full
of
thy
riches
but
if
the
thunder
and
the
flaming
fire
and
the
sweeping
flood
seem
discordant
they
existed
for
the
psalmist
as
well
as
for
us
and
they
do
not
seem
to
have
troubled
him
at
this
point
therefore
we
need
only
say
that
spinoza
religion
of
one
divine
substance
whose
unity
in
variety
is
holy
ought
to
stir
within
us
with
not
less
fervour
at
least
the
spirit
of
the
psalmist
concluding
prayer
let
the
sinners
be
consumed
out
of
the
earth
and
let
the
wicked
be
no
more
sidenote
spinoza
no
materialist
sidenote
notwithstanding
his
attribution
of
extension
to
god
sidenote
criticism
by
sir
f
pollock
sidenote
changes
in
theories
of
matter
since
spinoza
time
spinoza
maintenance
of
extension
as
one
of
the
two
infinite
divine
attributes
cognizable
by
us
has
with
a
certain
amount
of
plausibility
been
urged
as
a
note
of
materialism
and
this
reproach
has
been
supported
by
reference
to
his
insistence
that
in
man
the
body
and
the
soul
are
only
two
different
aspects
of
the
same
thing
for
to
him
the
body
is
a
finite
mode
of
god
infinite
attribute
of
extension
and
the
soul
a
finite
mode
of
god
infinite
attribute
of
thought
while
both
are
manifestations
of
the
one
eternal
divine
substance
still
if
in
any
way
we
are
to
regard
god
as
extended
it
seems
impossible
to
avoid
the
inference
that
we
regard
him
as
identified
with
matter
or
at
least
the
possibility
of
matter
sir
frederick
pollock
has
admitted
that
this
is
a
weak
point
in
spinoza
philosophy
and
mars
its
symmetry
but
being
more
concerned
with
his
religion
i
am
content
to
point
out
that
such
an
objection
was
much
more
effective
in
spinoza
time
than
it
is
for
the
whole
trend
of
philosophy
during
the
nineteenth
century
was
towards
a
view
of
extension
itself
as
a
mode
of
thought
and
therefore
toward
the
absorption
of
one
of
spinoza
theoretical
divine
attributes
in
the
other
sidenote
their
effect
on
his
system
now
if
this
should
prove
to
be
the
permanent
tendency
of
the
most
influential
thinkers
as
indeed
seems
most
likely
it
will
probably
be
held
that
spinoza
was
wrong
in
attributing
extension
to
the
eternal
as
one
of
the
qualities
of
his
substance
except
in
so
far
as
extension
is
if
not
a
necessary
at
any
rate
an
actual
and
so
far
as
we
know
a
universal
mode
of
thought
but
though
as
sir
frederick
pollock
has
pointed
out
spinoza
has
in
a
manner
counted
thought
twice
over
while
treating
of
the
only
two
infinite
attributes
cognizable
to
us
we
need
not
on
that
account
surrender
his
luminous
idea
of
god
as
a
being
absolutely
infinite
that
is
substance
consisting
of
infinite
attributes
whereof
each
one
expresses
eternal
and
infinite
being
nor
need
we
abandon
his
supplementary
but
essential
idea
of
modes
or
modifications
which
mould
the
attributes
into
the
varieties
of
finite
worlds
known
and
unknown
thus
it
may
be
that
in
spinoza
sense
of
the
word
attribute
we
shall
have
to
confess
that
only
one
comes
within
our
human
ken
that
of
thought
in
a
sense
which
includes
feeling
but
if
the
late
herbert
spencer
apart
from
his
synthetic
philosophy
of
phenomena
has
left
any
permanent
mark
on
the
religions
consciousness
it
has
been
by
a
consecration
of
the
mystery
of
the
ultimate
unknowable
and
in
the
spirit
of
reverence
thus
taught
by
him
we
may
still
hold
with
spinoza
that
the
eternal
has
an
infinity
of
other
attributes
with
their
infinite
modifications
not
within
our
cognizance
this
would
only
be
an
enlarged
application
of
hamlet
words
there
are
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
horatio
than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
or
to
put
it
in
another
way
the
universe
perceptible
to
us
is
only
one
of
an
infinity
of
universes
by
which
is
not
meant
an
infinite
extension
of
galaxies
in
space
but
the
and
so
to
speak
interpenetration
of
an
infinity
of
modes
of
existence
imperceptible
to
us
sidenote
god
is
identical
with
the
whole
of
being
to
spinoza
then
god
is
the
totality
of
being
but
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
that
he
identified
god
with
the
visible
or
with
any
conceivable
universe
for
either
of
these
must
fall
far
short
of
infinity
and
the
being
of
god
is
infinite
all
i
mean
when
i
say
that
spinoza
identifies
god
with
the
totality
of
existence
is
that
he
regards
the
deity
as
that
perfect
being
without
beginning
or
end
whose
essence
it
is
to
be
and
of
whom
all
that
exists
whether
known
to
us
or
not
is
separately
a
partial
and
comprehensively
a
perfect
expression
sidenote
his
doctrine
of
man
of
more
practical
interest
to
us
perhaps
is
spinoza
doctrine
of
man
though
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
explain
that
without
first
indicating
his
idea
of
god
in
his
view
then
man
is
a
finite
mode
of
the
two
divine
attributes
extension
and
thought
thus
both
the
extended
body
and
the
conscious
mind
have
their
substance
and
reality
in
god
but
the
essence
of
man
does
not
necessarily
involve
his
separate
existence
as
the
essence
of
god
implies
being
of
course
the
substance
of
man
is
imperishable
because
it
is
of
god
substance
nay
there
is
a
sense
in
which
each
man
being
an
eternal
thought
of
god
has
an
aspect
towards
eternity
or
exists
sub
specie
eternitatis
but
that
is
a
truth
transcending
the
finite
practical
world
with
which
we
have
to
do
sidenote
illustration
by
the
vortex
theory
sidenote
distinction
between
man
and
beast
according
to
spinoza
what
constitutes
the
real
essence
of
the
human
mind
is
the
divine
idea
of
a
certain
individual
creature
actually
existing
here
perhaps
modern
speculations
about
the
constitution
of
matter
may
help
us
if
we
use
them
with
due
reserve
to
grasp
spinoza
notion
of
a
res
singularis
in
actu
or
as
it
might
be
rendered
freely
a
creature
of
individual
functions
for
what
is
called
the
vortex
theory
though
as
old
as
cartesian
philosophy
has
recently
flashed
into
sudden
prominence
and
whether
or
no
the
speculation
be
only
a
passing
phase
of
human
thought
about
the
unknowable
it
equally
answers
the
purpose
of
illustration
thus
the
ether
is
supposed
to
fill
all
space
and
within
it
there
are
imagined
or
inferred
innumerable
tourbillons
or
vortices
which
though
parts
of
the
indefinitely
extended
ether
form
by
their
motion
little
worlds
in
themselves
these
little
worlds
are
by
some
regarded
as
the
atoms
which
by
composition
and
differentiation
build
up
our
palpable
universe
with
the
possibilities
of
such
a
theory
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
the
notion
of
the
vortex
in
the
ether
may
perhaps
help
us
to
a
glimpse
of
spinoza
notion
when
he
speaks
of
a
res
singularis
in
actu
a
creature
of
individual
functions
for
to
him
man
was
as
it
were
an
infinitesimal
vortex
in
a
phase
or
attribute
of
the
divine
substance
the
analogy
like
all
other
analogies
would
not
bear
being
pressed
but
it
does
suggest
to
us
a
picture
of
finite
individuality
in
action
or
function
subordinated
to
unity
with
infinite
substance
if
it
be
said
that
such
an
explanation
would
necessarily
include
the
conscious
life
of
beasts
and
birds
the
answer
would
seem
to
be
that
admitting
this
to
be
the
case
yet
in
man
the
divine
idea
of
individuality
is
more
fully
expressed
and
has
more
of
reality
than
in
any
lower
creature
sidenote
moral
difficulties
man
then
according
to
spinoza
is
in
god
and
of
god
but
what
are
we
to
say
of
bad
men
the
vile
the
base
the
liar
the
murderer
are
they
also
in
god
and
of
god
spinoza
does
not
blench
yes
they
are
but
here
comes
in
his
doctrine
of
adequate
and
inadequate
ideas
thus
if
you
see
the
colour
red
it
completely
expresses
itself
it
can
not
be
defined
and
needs
no
explanation
as
it
is
in
the
infinite
thought
so
it
is
in
ours
we
have
an
adequate
idea
of
it
but
now
if
you
see
on
an
artist
canvas
a
splotch
of
red
and
blue
and
yellow
part
of
a
work
only
begun
it
gives
you
no
adequate
idea
true
you
have
an
adequate
idea
of
each
several
colour
but
not
of
their
relations
to
the
work
conceived
to
get
that
you
would
have
to
enter
into
the
mind
of
the
artist
and
see
as
he
sees
then
the
splotch
of
colour
would
take
its
place
as
part
of
a
harmonious
whole
and
would
give
you
an
adequate
idea
just
as
it
does
to
the
artist
sidenote
but
the
universe
is
not
an
unfinished
picture
sidenote
it
is
an
eternal
whole
of
which
a
partial
consideration
is
misleading
now
according
to
spinoza
when
we
see
things
as
they
appear
in
infinite
thought
we
have
an
adequate
idea
but
if
we
see
only
a
component
element
in
an
idea
let
us
say
of
the
divine
artist
then
our
idea
is
inadequate
hence
we
misjudge
things
and
of
the
part
played
by
bad
men
in
the
divine
whole
we
certainly
have
no
adequate
idea
but
here
again
we
must
be
on
our
guard
against
the
abuse
of
illustrations
for
it
is
not
to
be
inferred
that
spinoza
regards
the
universe
as
an
unfinished
picture
of
which
the
completion
will
justify
the
beginning
on
the
contrary
the
universe
is
to
him
eternal
the
necessary
expression
of
the
infinite
attributes
of
eternal
being
still
the
analogy
may
help
us
for
the
concentration
of
attention
on
a
single
part
of
an
ordered
whole
may
quite
as
certainly
as
a
glance
at
an
unfinished
work
be
the
occasion
of
an
inadequate
idea
in
effect
the
suggestion
is
that
if
we
like
god
could
contemplate
the
infinite
universe
all
at
once
and
have
an
adequate
idea
thereof
in
other
words
if
we
could
ascend
to
the
self
contemplation
of
the
eternal
we
should
have
the
bliss
associated
by
long
habit
with
the
words
of
the
psalmist
i
shall
be
satisfied
when
i
awake
with
thy
likeness
such
bliss
however
is
only
approximately
attainable
in
moments
of
mystic
transport
and
when
as
in
so
many
experiences
we
see
only
in
part
and
have
inadequate
ideas
faith
in
the
eternal
whole
is
needed
to
keep
us
from
blasphemy
sidenote

sidenote
freedom

with
such
necessarily
brief
hints
as

spinoza
attitude
towards

i
resume
his
doctrine
of
man
the
individual
creature
as
a
centre
of
action
of
final
causes
spinoza
will
not
hear
but
if
instead
of
asking
what
is
the
chief
end
of
man
we
ask
what
is
the
idea
of
man
spinoza
answers
that
it
is
the
realization
of
a
mode
of
the
divine
attributes
extension
and
thought
and
if
this
should
seem
unsatisfying
let
it
be
remembered
that
to
this
devout
pantheist
the
divine
attributes
and
their
modes
were
the
expression
of
the
very
substance
and
life
of
god
now
with
extension
for
reasons
already
given
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
except
to
say
that
at
least
spinoza
teaching
would
suggest
the
idea
of
sana
in
corpore
because
to
him
the
mind
was
the
idea
of
the
body
and
the
body
the
object
not
quite
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
mind
but
as
regards
the
human
mode
of
the
divine
attribute
of
thought
spinoza
makes
its
ideal
to
be
a
life
absorbed
in
such
contemplation
of
the
blessed
god
the
infinite
whole
as
shall
react
on
the
creature
in
inspirations
of
freedom
purity
and
love
sidenote
idea
of
freedom
and
first
as
to
freedom
spinoza
means
by
this
not
caprice
nor
the
monstrous
miracle
of
causeless
action
but
independence
of
external
force
or
of
any
disproportionate
and
illegitimate
passion
the
freedom
to
which
he
aspires
is
the
freedom
of
god
who
eternally
acts
in
accordance
with
the
mutual
harmony
of
the
whole
attributes
of
his
nature
not
one
of
which
clashes
with
another
so
spinoza
free
man
is
one
in
whom
all
aspirations
and
energies
converging
in
one
resultant
the
expression
of
the
divine
idea
move
him
in
harmony
with
the
universe
from
such
a
point
of
view
the
quibbles
about
free
will
in
the
sense
of
causeless
action
cease
to
have
any
meaning
for
if
the
good
man
says
i
could
have
done
otherwise
if
i
had
liked
the
obvious
reply
is
yes
but
you
would
not
have
liked
because
the
will
is
not
a
separate
faculty
but
the
expression
of
the
whole
nature
as
that
exists
at
the
moment
of
willing
and
the
only
real
freedom
is
the
unimpeded
conglomerate
impulse
to
do
right
but
should
it
be
asked
what
if
the
resultant
impulse
of
the
whole
nature
is
toward
wrong
the
answer
is
in
that
case
there
is
no
freedom
but
a
slavery
to
some
external
influence
or
to
a
disturbed
balance
of
the
passions
or
if
it
be
asked
what
is
right
that
is
a
far
reaching
question
to
the
solution
of
which
spinoza
bends
all
his
splendid
powers
but
limits
of
space
preclude
me
from
saying
more
than
that
his
ideal
of
right
will
be
found
conformable
to
the
highest
standards
of
the
most
spiritual
religions
sidenote
purity
this
ideal
i
ventured
to
symbolize
rather
than
define
as
purity
for
after
all
the
philosophic
reasoning
with
which
it
is
no
less
lucidly
than
laboriously
worked
out
in
the
final
book
of
his
concerning
human
freedom
the
moral
result
of
all
this
intellectual
effort
is
that
same
cleansing
of
the
soul
from
vain
desire
and
that
subordination
of
the
earthly
self
to
its
divine
idea
which
we
are
taught
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
and
while
surely
every
one
but
a
fanatical
must
allow
the
greater
prophetic
worth
of
the
galilean
who
could
teach
these
sublime
lessons
so
that
the
common
people
heard
him
gladly
it
seems
difficult
to
deny
to
the
heretic
jew
of
the
hague
the
second
rank
among
the
teachers
given
to
the
world
by
that
strangely
gifted
race
for
though
he
could
not
speak
to
the
common
people
he
left
as
his
legacy
to
mankind
not
so
much
a
system
of
philosophy
as
an
impregnable
foundation
for
morals
and
religion
available
for
the
time
now
coming
upon
us
such
a
time
as
that
suggested
by
the
writer
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
when
he
spoke
of
the
removing
of
those
things
that
are
shaken
as
of
things
that
are
made
that
those
things
which
can
not
be
shaken
may
remain
no
doubt
sir
frederic
pollock
is
quite
right
in
declaring
that
spinoza
would
have
been
the
very
last
man
to
desire
any
one
to
become
a
spinozist
but
that
is
quite
consistent
with
the
inspired
pantheist
infinite
longing
to
see
all
men
blessed
by
that
inward
peace
which
he
proved
by
his
own
heroic
experience
to
be
identical
with
the
conferred
and
maintained
by
devout
contemplation
of
god
being
and
our
place
therein
if
then
i
regard
purity
as
the
best
symbol
of
such
a
moral
ideal
it
is
because
the
word
connotes
together
with
freedom
from
discordant
passion
a
frankly
unconstrained
recognition
of
the
simplicity
of
our
relation
to
god
for
surely
when
once
the
self
has
made
the
great
surrender
and
becomes
content
to
be
nothing
that
in
paul
words
god
may
be
all
in
all
the
whole
problem
of
life
is
infinitely
simplified
in
the
sense
that
no
farther
degree
of
simplification
is
possible
because
all
contradictions
of
pain
and
evil
and
sorrow
are
dissolved
in
that
act
of
surrender
we
must
indeed
recognize
that
to
our
inadequate
ideas
the
time
often
seems
out
of
joint
but
we
need
not
with
hamlet
cry
out
on
an
impossible
spite
for
when
once
it
is
heartily
and
loyally
realized
that
not
our
partial
likings
but
the
eternal
harmony
of
the
whole
is
the
glory
of
god
we
already
anticipate
the
peace
of
absorption
in
the
infinite
sidenote
love
nor
is
this
moral
ideal
without
a
sacred
passion
at
least
to
ordinary
men
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
spinoza
in
the
stillness
of
his
sacred
peace
ignored
the
word
but
he
still
held
that
the
larger
our
view
of
the
universe
and
of
our
communion
therewith
the
more
we
have
of
god
in
us
and
the
more
do
we
realize
an
intellectual
love
towards
him
that
this
in
his
case
was
no
barren
sentiment
but
a
genuine
moral
inspiration
was
proved
by
his
life
for
truly
he
endured
as
seeing
him
who
is
invisible
and
it
was
not
by
faculties
wholly
wanting
to
smaller
men
that
he
did
this
for
though
his
intellect
was
in
some
respects
almost
beyond
compare
it
was
rather
by
his
contemplation
that
he
was
kept
at
peace
indeed
he
knew
far
less
of
the
extended
universe
than
our
men
of
science
do
and
his
doctrines
of
mind
and
thought
are
by
indisputable
authorities
regarded
as
imperfect
but
imagining
what
god
must
be
could
we
have
an
adequate
idea
not
only
of
his
being
which
spinoza
thought
he
had
but
of
his
infinite
attributes
and
their
modes
which
spinoza
recognized
that
he
had
not
he
declared
that
love
toward
god
was
the
very
highest
good
and
it
was
supremely
blessed
in
this
that
it
could
engender
no
jealousy
nor
selfishness
nor
sectarian
zeal
but
rather
a
charity
which
would
gather
all
mankind
into
the
present
heaven
of
that

of
those
to

the
following
particulars
may
be
given
spinoza
was
born
in
amsterdam
november
of
a
fairly
prosperous
jewish
family
originally
from
portugal
he
received
thorough
instruction
in
the
language
and
literature
of
the
hebrews
and
in
addition
became
a
good
latin
scholar
so
far
as
to
write
and
correspond
in
that
language
he
was
early
interested
in
philosophy
and
especially
attracted
for
a
time
by
the
writings
of
descartes
by
the
time
he
was
years
old
he
was
suspected
of
heresy
and
in
his
year
was
cut
off
from
the
synagogue
with
a
frightful
curse
his
family
disowned
him
and
for
his
maintenance
he
turned
to
the
polishing
of
lenses
a
trade
already
learned
in
accordance
with
the
jewish
custom
that
every
boy
must
have
a
handicraft
what
he
earned
would
hardly
be
considered
a
living
wage
in
these
days
but
according
to
colerus
his
first
biographer
who
enquired
of
the
householders
with
whom
spinoza
lodged
his
maintenance
of
often
cost
no
more
than
various
incidents
proved
his
total
indifference
to
money
except
as
far
as
needed
to
provide
things
honest
in
the
sight
of
all
men
though
of
an
amiable
and
sociable
disposition
he
lived
a
solitary
life
while
not
indisposed
to
kindly
talk
with
his
humbler
neighbours
he
had
some
of
the
greatest
scholars
of
the
day
among
his
correspondents
he
published
but
little
during
his
life
leaving
his
greatest
work
as
a
legacy
to
the
world

his
early
death

is
to
be
observed
that

footnote
it
is
of
course
true
that
spinoza
considered
himself
to
have
a
clear
and
adequate
conception
of
god
but
by
this
he
meant
only
that
as
a
philosopher
he
had
an
intuitive
certainty
of
eternal
and
infinite
being
so
have
all
of
us
humbler
mortals
though
we
should
not
have
been
able
to
express
it
for
ourselves
no
one
supposes
that
for
an
indefinite
space
of
time
or
eternity
there
was
nothing
and
then
suddenly
there
was
something
but
if
not
then
everyone
recognises
with
spinoza
the
fact
of
eternal
being
though
of
course
he
saw
what
this
recognition
meant
as
the
many
do
not
but
when
it
comes
to
the
facts
of
mortal
imperfections
and
ignorance
spinoza
with
his
theory
of
inadequate
ideas
is
as
ready
as
spencer
to
acknowledge
the
unknowable

i
do
not
think
it

in

the

may
be

i
suspect
that

affected
latinity
thus
several
ecclesiastical
writers
are
quoted
as
using
the

the
sense
of

or
function
surely
this
would
suit
spinoza
definition
of
the
mind
for
he
treats
it
as
a
centre
of
phenomenal
activity
amidst
the
infinite
modes
of
the
divine
attribute
its
apparent
individuality
is
a
consequence
of
its
spontaneity
as
a
centre
of

the
spontaneity
is
consistent
with
the
absolute

assumed
throughout

accordingly
when

is
that
the

has
the

may
believe

if

is
not

there
is
something
other

was
too
literary
to
be
a

is
though
he
thought
more
of

of
expression
than
of

satirical
disintegration
of
the

wherever
it
is
effective
makes
pantheism
the

may
be
offered

their
incongruity
with

of

it
dies

treat
it

involving
a
king
of
kings
enthroned
like
an
eastern
monarch
and
sending
forth
his
ministering
spirits
or
appointing
his
angel
deputies
to
direct
and
govern
at
his
beck
or
if
it
be
said
that
never
except
in
the
ages
of
primeval
simplicity
or
amongst
later
generations
living
under
primeval
conditions
has
such
a
conception
been
entertained
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
broadest
churchman
to
say
what
has
been
put
in
its
place
it
is
vain
to
remind
us
how
later
christianity
has
patronised
nebular
hypotheses
and
the
doctrine
of
evolution
for
these
give
no
definite
substitute
whatever
for
the
old
story
that
elohim
spoke
and
it
was
done
he
commanded
and
it
stood
fast
whence
the
fiery
mists
by
the
rotation
and
cooling
of
which
the
worlds
were
slowly
evolved
we
are
told
that
the
same
process
is
going
on
now
within
the
ken
of
astronomers
but
does
any
one
suppose
that
in
those
realms
of
space
god
is
evoking
something
out
of
nothing
or
saying
be
and
there
is
no
we
are
assured
that
these
fiery
mists
are
formed
by
the
collision
of
misguided
orbs
and
we
are
even
asked
or
at
least
we
asked
to
believe
that
this
process
must
go
on
until
all
systems
are
agglomerated
in
one
orb
to
be
ultimately
congealed
into
stone
what
then
is
the
office
of
the
creator
according
to
this
scheme
as
repulsive
as
it
is
absurd
it
would
appear
that
at
some
moment
in
a
vacuous
eternity
he
calls
matter
out
of
nothing
whirls
it
into
fiery
vortices
and
then
lets
it
cool
down
to
the
absolute
zero
wherein
death
reigns
for
ever
sidenote
the
protest
of
faith
sidenote
sustained
by
latest
science
sidenote
which
suggests
an
infinite
unity
but
after
all
there
is
a
spirit
in
man
and
the
inspiration
of
the
almighty
of
the
eternal
of
the
glorious
whole
to
which
we
belong
stirs
in
us
a
protest
against
this
blasphemy
of
ignorance
ignorance
i
say
for
it
was
not
the
knowledge
of
our
wise
men
that
whispered
such
things
but
their
sense
of
the
vacuity
beyond
their
knowledge
up
to
certain
bounds
their
grasp
of
facts
their
insight
into
physical
order
their
mathematical
skill
were
beyond
all
praise
but
beyond
that
bound
aye
and
within
it
in
every
inconceivable
mode
of
the
action
of
force
as
for
example
in
gravitation
brooded
the
unknowable
and
it
was
not
their
knowledge
but
their
ignorance
that
entailed
absurd
issues
already
there
are
signs
that
even
celestial
physics
and
mathematics
will
refuse
to
endorse
as
final
so
revolting
a
scheme
of
material
evolution
and
devolution
ending
only
in
universal
death
and
when
once
the
of
new
order
out
of
the
old
is
seen
to
be
everywhere
and
eternally
taking
place
then
all
the
hints
given
us
by
science
of
the
ultimate
oneness
of
all
things
converge
in
the
faith
that
all
is
god
and
god
is
all
for
certainly
the
latest
observations
on
matter
suggest
that
all
forms
of
it
are
variations
of
one
ultimate
substance
and
the
convertibility
of
forces
as
well
as
the
conservation
of
force
point
to
one
eternal
energy
nor
is
the
duality
thus
suggested
any
final
conclusion
for
few
i
imagine
would
now
contend
that
in
the
last
result
matter
and
force
are
fundamentally
different
things
in
fact
monism
holds
the
field
and
though
the
evolution
of
human
opinion
is
very
slow
it
appears
safe
to
predict
that
the
triumph
of
that
world
theory
is
assured
sidenote
idea
of
creation
incongruous
with
modern
knowledge
this
result
is
additionally
secured
by
the
increasing
incongruity
felt
between
the
immeasurable
vastness
of
the
universe
even
as
known
and
the
idea
of
creation
out
of
nothing
when
the
almighty
could
be
seriously
pictured
as
constructing
chambers
for
himself
and
his
heavenly
host
above
the
middle
floor
of
earth
for
the
children
of
men
and
the
abyss
for
ghosts
and
devils
the
notion
that
his
word
evoked
that
puny
structure
from
nothing
might
be
invested
by
poets
and
prophets
with
a
certain
grandeur
each
part
of
the
work
had
an
object
as
conceivable
as
that
of
each
floor
in
a
house
and
according
to
petty
human
notions
of
utility
nothing
was
wasted
but
now
when
our
astronomers
confront
us
with
countless
millions
of
orbs
to
whose
extension
in
space
no
bound
can
be
proved
while
some
of
them
tell
us
that
the
whole
immensity
is
a
desert
of
alternate
fire
and
darkness
with
no
spark
of
finite
intellect
except
in
our
tiny
earth
some
of
us
at
least
can
not
help
feeling
that
the
notion
of
a
personal
divine
worker
calling
this
huge
enigma
out
of
blank
eternal
nothing
is
enormously
and
utterly
incongruous
both
with
reverence
and
common
sense
and
if
the
pantheist
in
these
days
be
asked
what
interpretation
then
do
you
propose
his
answer
is
i
propose
none
i
take
things
as
they
are
in
their
totality
they
are
unknowable
as
indeed
even
science
finds
they
are
in
their
infinitesimal
parts
but
we
need
not
on
this
account
lose
the
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
sidenote
pantheistic
morality
sidenote
the
law
of
the
whole
for
between
the
infinite
and
the
infinitesimal
the
human
experience
realizes
itself
in
surroundings
which
when
observed
and
reflected
on
make
the
impression
of
ordered
relations
of
parts
by
a
necessity
of
our
finite
and
individual
existence
as
centres
of
action
a
necessity
of
which
we
can
give
no
account
we
present
those
relations
to
ourselves
in
forms
of
time
and
space
then
when
our
experience
is
large
enough
and
ripe
enough
being
enriched
and
stimulated
by
the
experience
of
humanity
as
recorded
in
tradition
custom
bibles
and
epics
we
attain
to
the
moral
sense
and
realize
that
we
are
bound
to
be
loyal
to
something
greater
than
self
that
greater
may
be
the
tribe
the
nation
humanity
or
god
but
in
far
the
larger
number
of
cases
in
which
this
sense
of
willing
loyalty
is
aroused
its
cause
is
the
appeal
to
us
of
some
whole
of
which
we
form
a
part
certainly
this
is
so
with
the
patriot
and
the
philanthropist
indeed
it
would
be
difficult
or
impossible
to
find
any
human
relationship
from
the
family
upwards
through
the
wider
circles
of
school
club
municipality
nationality
in
which
this
sense
of
loyalty
or
devotion
to
the
law
of
the
whole
is
not
the
best
incentive
to
devotion
sidenote
of
that
law
of
the
whole
loyalty
to
god
in
the
supreme
application
yet
when
we
come
to
contemplate
the
final
and
supreme
object
of
devotion
the
eternal
himself
it
has
been
almost
the
universal
custom
to
make
a
surprising
exception
and
to
regard
religion
as
maintainable
only
by
recognition
of
a
tremendous
outward
authority
to
which
only
such
loyalty
is
possible
as
in
barbarous
times
was
fostered
towards
a
personal
chieftain
or
feudal
king
now
pantheism
holds
this
to
be
an
error
and
regards
obedience
and
devotion
to
god
as
the
ultimate
and
most
inspiring
application
of
that
principle
of
the
loyalty
of
the
part
to
the
whole
which
runs
through
all
morality
sidenote
conclusion
why
should
we
be
supposed
to
be
without
god
because
we
acknowledge
him
to
be
superpersonal
and
past
finding
out
or
why
should
we
be
suspected
of
denying
the
divinity
of
evolution
because
we
do
not
believe
the
eternal
all
to
be
subject
to
it
this
instinct
of
loyalty
in
the
sense
of
to
any
greater
whole
of
which
we
are
part
the
distinction
of
right
and
wrong
thence
arising
and
the
aspiration
after
a
moral
ideal
are
not
of
man
invention
speaking
as
we
can
not
help
doing
in
terms
of
time
i
hold
that
the
germs
of
this
higher
were
always
in
the
divine
unity
out
of
which
man
is
evolved
and
in
pursuing
the
inspirations
of
that
higher
life
as
experience
suggests
them
humanity
has
always
had
a
guide
and
a
saviour
in
the
living
god
of
whom
the
race
of
man
is
an
infinitesimal
phase
in
such
an
interpretation
of
man
relations
to
god
there
is
nothing
necessarily
hostile
to
any
form
of
genuine
religion
true
there
are
in
the
creeds
many
statements
which
we
can
not
accept
in
the
letter
but
there
are
few
which
have
not
some
spiritual
suggestion
for
us
and
if
we
can
attain
to
that
intellectual
love
of
god
in
which
spinoza
was
absorbed
we
have
no
quarrel
with
any
mode
of
sincere
devotion
pious
catholic
protestant
vedantist
mohammedan
all
by
the
implicit
though
unrecognised
necessities
of
their
faith
worship
the
same
god
as
ourselves
but
the
wrangles
of
sectarian
zeal
no
longer
concern
us
for
we
have
passed
to
where
beyond
those
voices
there
is
peace
