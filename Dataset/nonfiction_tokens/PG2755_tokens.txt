dumas
the
set
of
eight
volumes
of
contents
on
the
june
at
the
very
moment
when
the
destiny
of
europe
was
being
decided
at
waterloo
a
man
dressed
like
a
beggar
was
silently
following
the
road
from
toulon
to
marseilles
arrived
at
the
entrance
of
the
gorge
of
ollioulles
he
halted
on
a
little
eminence
from
which
he
could
see
all
the
surrounding
country
then
either
because
he
had
reached
the
end
of
his
journey
or
because
before
attempting
that
forbidding
sombre
pass
which
is
called
the
thermopylae
of
provence
he
wished
to
enjoy
the
magnificent
view
which
spread
to
the
southern
horizon
a
little
longer
he
went
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
ditch
which
bordered
the
road
turning
his
back
on
the
mountains
which
rise
like
an
amphitheatre
to
the
north
of
the
town
and
having
at
his
feet
a
rich
plain
covered
with
tropical
vegetation
exotics
of
a
conservatory
trees
and
flowers
quite
unknown
in
any
other
part
of
france
beyond
this
plain
glittering
in
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
pale
and
motionless
as
a
mirror
lay
the
sea
and
on
the
surface
of
the
water
glided
one
which
taking
advantage
of
a
fresh
land
breeze
had
all
sails
spread
and
was
bowling
along
rapidly
making
for
italian
seas
the
beggar
followed
it
eagerly
with
his
eyes
until
it
disappeared
between
the
cape
of
gien
and
the
first
of
the
islands
of
hyeres
then
as
the
white
apparition
vanished
he
sighed
deeply
let
his
head
fall
into
his
hands
and
remained
motionless
and
absorbed
in
his
reflections
until
the
tramplings
of
a
cavalcade
made
him
start
he
looked
up
shook
back
his
long
black
hair
as
if
he
wished
to
get
rid
of
the
gloomy
thoughts
which
were
overwhelming
him
and
looking
at
the
entrance
to
the
gorge
from
whence
the
noise
came
he
soon
saw
two
riders
appear
who
were
no
doubt
well
known
to
him
for
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
he
let
fall
the
stick
he
was
carrying
and
folding
his
arms
he
turned
towards
them
on
their
side
the
had
hardly
seen
him
before
they
halted
and
the
foremost
dismounted
threw
his
bridle
to
his
companion
and
uncovering
though
fifty
paces
from
the
man
in
rags
advanced
respectfully
towards
him
the
beggar
allowed
him
to
approach
with
an
air
of
sombre
dignity
and
without
a
single
movement
then
when
he
was
quite
marshal
have
you
news
for
me
said
the
beggar
sire
said
the
other
sadly
what
are
they
that
i
could
wish
it
were
anyone
but
myself
to
announce
them
to
your
the
emperor
refuses
my
services
he
forgets
the
victories
of
aboukir
eylau
and
moscow
sire
but
he
remembers
the
treaty
of
naples
the
taking
of
reggio
and
the
declaration
of
war
of
the
viceroy
of
the
beggar
struck
his
forehead
yes
i
daresay
he
thinks
i
deserve
his
reproaches
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
he
ought
to
remember
that
there
are
two
men
in
soldier
whom
he
made
his
brother
and
the
brother
whom
he
made
a
king
yes
as
brother
i
have
treated
him
ill
but
as
king
upon
my
soul
i
could
not
have
acted
differently
i
had
to
choose
between
my
sword
and
my
crown
and
between
a
regiment
and
a
people
listen
brune
you
do
not
know
how
it
all
happened
there
was
an
english
fleet
the
guns
of
which
were
growling
in
the
port
there
was
a
neapolitan
population
howling
in
the
streets
if
i
had
been
alone
i
would
have
passed
through
the
fleet
with
one
boat
through
the
crowd
with
my
sword
alone
but
i
had
a
wife
and
children
yet
i
hesitated
the
idea
of
being
called
traitor
and
deserter
caused
me
to
shed
more
tears
than
the
loss
of
my
throne
or
perhaps
the
death
of
those
i
love
best
will
ever
wring
from
me
and
so
he
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
me
he
refuses
me
as
general
captain
private
then
what
is
left
for
me
to
do
your
majesty
must
leave
france
if
i
obey
orders
are
to
arrest
you
and
deliver
you
up
to
a
comrade
you
will
not
do
that
shall
do
it
praying
god
to
strike
me
dead
in
the
moment
i
lay
hands
on
you
you
all
over
brune
you
have
been
able
to
remain
a
good
loyal
fellow
he
did
not
give
you
a
kingdom
he
did
not
encircle
your
brow
with
a
band
of
iron
which
men
call
a
crown
and
which
drives
one
mad
he
did
not
place
you
between
your
conscience
and
your
family
so
i
must
leave
france
begin
my
vagabond
life
again
and
say
farewell
to
toulon
which
recalls
so
many
memories
to
me
see
brune
continued
murat
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
marshal
not
the
pines
yonder
as
fine
as
any
at
the
villa
pamfili
the
palms
as
imposing
as
any
at
cairo
the
mountains
as
grand
as
any
range
in
the
tyrol
look
to
your
left
is
not
cape
gien
something
like
castellamare
and
out
vesuvius
and
see
at
the
farthest
point
of
the
gulf
is
it
not
like
my
rock
of
capri
which
lamarque
juggled
away
so
cleverly
from
that
idiot
of
a
sir
hudson
lowe
my
god
and
i
must
leave
all
this
is
there
no
way
of
remaining
on
this
little
corner
of
french
me
brune
break
my
heart
sire
answered
the
marshal
say
no
more
about
it
what
news
emperor
has
left
paris
to
join
the
army
they
must
be
fighting
now
and
i
not
there
oh
i
feel
i
could
have
been
of
use
to
him
on
this
battlefield
how
i
would
have
gloried
in
charging
those
miserable
prussians
and
dastardly
english
brune
give
me
a
passport
go
at
full
speed
reach
the
army
i
will
make
myself
known
to
some
colonel
i
shall
say
me
your
charge
at
its
head
and
if
the
emperor
does
not
clasp
my
hand
blow
my
brains
out
i
swear
i
will
do
what
i
ask
brune
and
however
it
may
end
my
eternal
gratitude
will
be
yours
can
not
well
say
no
more
about
your
majesty
is
going
to
leave
france
know
obey
your
orders
marshal
and
if
you
come
across
me
again
have
me
arrested
another
way
of
doing
something
for
me
life
is
a
heavy
burden
nowadays
he
who
will
relieve
me
of
it
will
be
welcome
he
held
out
his
hand
to
the
marshal
who
tried
to
kiss
it
but
murat
opened
his
arms
the
two
old
comrades
held
each
other
fast
for
a
moment
with
swelling
hearts
and
eyes
full
of
tears
then
at
last
they
parted
brune
remounted
his
horse
murat
picked
up
his
stick
again
and
the
two
men
went
away
in
opposite
directions
one
to
meet
his
death
by
assassination
at
avignon
the
other
to
be
shot
at
pizzo
meanwhile
like
richard
iii
napoleon
was
bartering
his
crown
against
a
horse
at
waterloo
after
the
interview
that
has
just
been
related
murat
took
refuge
with
his
nephew
who
was
called
bonafoux
and
who
was
captain
of
a
frigate
but
this
retreat
could
only
be
temporary
for
the
relationship
would
inevitably
awake
the
suspicions
of
the
authorities
in
consequence
bonafoux
set
about
finding
a
more
secret
place
of
refuge
for
his
uncle
he
hit
on
one
of
his
friends
an
avocat
a
man
famed
for
his
integrity
and
that
very
evening
bonafoux
went
to
see
him
after
chatting
on
general
subjects
he
asked
his
friend
if
he
had
not
a
house
at
the
seaside
and
receiving
an
affirmative
answer
he
invited
himself
to
breakfast
there
the
next
day
the
proposal
naturally
enough
was
agreed
to
with
pleasure
the
next
day
at
the
appointed
hour
bonafoux
arrived
at
bonette
which
was
the
name
of
the
country
house
where
wife
and
daughter
were
staying
marouin
himself
was
kept
by
his
work
at
toulon
after
the
ordinary
greetings
bonafoux
stepped
to
the
window
beckoning
to
marouin
to
rejoin
him
thought
he
said
uneasily
your
house
was
by
the
are
hardly
ten
walk
from
it
is
not
in
hill
prevents
you
from
seeing
we
go
for
a
stroll
on
the
beach
before
breakfast
is
served
all
means
well
your
horse
is
still
saddled
i
will
order
will
come
back
for
marouin
went
out
bonafoux
remained
at
the
window
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
the
ladies
of
the
house
occupied
in
preparations
for
the
meal
did
not
observe
or
did
not
appear
to
observe
his
preoccupation
in
five
minutes
marouin
came
back
he
was
ready
to
start
the
avocat
and
his
friend
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
quickly
down
to
the
sea
on
the
beach
the
captain
slackened
his
pace
and
riding
along
the
shore
for
about
half
an
hour
he
seemed
to
be
examining
the
bearings
of
the
coast
with
great
attention
marouin
followed
without
inquiring
into
his
investigations
which
seemed
natural
enough
for
a
naval
officer
after
about
an
hour
the
two
men
went
back
to
the
house
marouin
wished
to
have
the
horses
unsaddled
but
bonafoux
objected
saying
that
he
must
go
back
to
toulon
immediately
after
lunch
indeed
the
coffee
was
hardly
finished
before
he
rose
and
took
leave
of
his
hosts
marouin
called
back
to
town
by
his
work
mounted
his
horse
too
and
the
two
friends
rode
back
to
toulon
together
after
riding
along
for
ten
minutes
bonafoux
went
close
to
his
companion
and
touched
him
on
the
he
said
have
an
important
secret
to
confide
to
captain
after
a
father
confessor
you
know
there
is
no
one
so
discreet
as
a
notary
and
after
a
notary
an
can
quite
understand
that
i
did
not
come
to
your
country
house
just
for
the
pleasure
of
the
ride
a
more
important
object
a
serious
responsibility
preoccupied
me
i
have
chosen
you
out
of
all
my
friends
believing
that
you
were
devoted
enough
to
me
to
render
me
a
great
did
well
us
go
straight
to
the
point
as
men
who
respect
and
trust
each
other
should
do
my
uncle
king
joachim
is
proscribed
he
has
taken
refuge
with
me
but
he
can
not
remain
there
for
i
am
the
first
person
they
will
suspect
your
house
is
in
an
isolated
position
and
consequently
we
could
not
find
a
better
retreat
for
him
you
must
put
it
at
our
disposal
until
events
enable
the
king
to
come
to
some
is
at
your
service
said
marouin
my
uncle
shall
sleep
there
at
least
give
me
time
to
make
some
preparations
worthy
of
my
royal
poor
marouin
you
are
giving
yourself
unnecessary
trouble
and
making
a
vexatious
delay
for
us
king
joachim
is
no
longer
accustomed
to
palaces
and
courtiers
he
is
only
too
happy
nowadays
to
find
a
cottage
with
a
friend
in
it
besides
i
have
let
him
know
about
it
so
sure
was
i
of
your
answer
he
is
counting
on
sleeping
at
your
house
and
if
i
try
to
change
his
determination
now
he
will
see
a
refusal
in
what
is
only
a
postponement
and
you
will
lose
all
the
credit
for
your
generous
and
noble
action
is
agreed
at
ten
at
the
champs
de
with
these
words
the
captain
put
his
horse
to
a
gallop
and
disappeared
marouin
turned
his
horse
and
went
back
to
his
country
house
to
give
the
necessary
orders
for
the
reception
of
a
stranger
whose
name
he
did
not
mention
at
ten
at
night
as
had
been
agreed
marouin
was
on
the
champs
de
mars
then
covered
with
marshal
no
one
had
arrived
yet
he
walked
up
and
down
between
the
until
a
functionary
came
to
ask
what
he
was
doing
he
was
hard
put
to
it
to
find
an
answer
a
man
is
hardly
likely
to
be
wandering
about
in
an
artillery
park
at
ten
at
night
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
the
thing
he
asked
to
see
the
commanding
officer
the
officer
came
up
marouin
informed
him
that
he
was
an
avocat
attached
to
the
law
courts
of
toulon
and
told
him
that
he
had
arranged
to
meet
someone
on
the
champs
de
mars
not
knowing
that
it
was
prohibited
and
that
he
was
still
waiting
for
that
person
after
this
explanation
the
officer
authorised
him
to
remain
and
went
back
to
his
quarters
the
sentinel
a
faithful
adherent
to
discipline
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
with
his
measured
step
without
troubling
any
more
about
the
presence
a
few
moments
later
a
group
of
several
persons
appeared
from
the
direction
of
les
lices
the
night
was
magnificent
and
the
moon
brilliant
marouin
recognised
bonafoux
and
went
up
to
him
the
captain
at
once
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
the
king
and
speaking
in
turn
to
each
of
he
said
is
the
friend
i
told
you
then
turning
to
he
said
the
king
of
naples
exile
and
fugitive
whom
i
confide
to
your
care
i
do
not
speak
of
the
possibility
that
some
day
he
may
get
back
his
crown
that
would
deprive
you
of
the
credit
of
your
fine
action
now
be
his
will
follow
at
a
distance
march
the
king
and
the
lawyer
set
out
at
once
together
murat
was
dressed
in
a
blue
buttoned
to
the
throat
he
wore
white
trousers
and
top
boots
with
spurs
he
had
long
hair
moustache
and
thick
whiskers
which
would
reach
round
his
neck
as
they
rode
along
he
questioned
his
host
about
the
situation
of
his
country
house
and
the
facility
for
reaching
the
sea
in
case
of
a
surprise
towards
midnight
the
king
and
marouin
arrived
at
bonette
the
royal
suite
came
up
in
about
ten
minutes
it
consisted
of
about
thirty
individuals
after
partaking
of
some
light
refreshment
this
little
troop
the
last
of
the
court
of
the
deposed
king
retired
to
disperse
in
the
town
and
its
environs
and
murat
remained
alone
with
the
women
only
keeping
one
valet
named
leblanc
murat
stayed
nearly
a
month
in
this
retirement
spending
all
his
time
in
answering
the
newspapers
which
accused
him
of
treason
to
the
emperor
this
accusation
was
his
absorbing
idea
a
phantom
a
spectre
to
him
day
and
night
he
tried
to
shake
it
off
seeking
in
the
difficult
position
in
which
he
had
found
himself
all
the
reasons
which
it
might
offer
him
for
acting
as
he
had
acted
meanwhile
the
terrible
news
of
the
defeat
at
waterloo
had
spread
abroad
the
emperor
who
had
exiled
him
was
an
exile
himself
and
he
was
waiting
at
rochefort
like
murat
at
toulon
to
hear
what
his
enemies
would
decide
against
him
no
one
knows
to
this
day
what
inward
prompting
napoleon
obeyed
when
rejecting
the
counsels
of
general
lallemande
and
the
devotion
of
captain
bodin
he
preferred
england
to
america
and
went
like
a
modern
prometheus
to
be
chained
to
the
rock
of
helena
we
are
going
to
relate
the
fortuitous
circumstance
which
led
murat
to
the
moat
of
pizzo
then
we
will
leave
it
to
fatalists
to
draw
from
this
strange
story
whatever
philosophical
deduction
may
please
them
we
as
humble
annalists
can
only
vouch
for
the
truth
of
the
facts
we
have
already
related
and
of
those
which
will
follow
king
louis
xviii
remounted
his
throne
consequently
murat
lost
all
hope
of
remaining
in
france
he
felt
he
was
bound
to
go
his
nephew
bonafoux
fitted
out
a
frigate
for
the
united
states
under
the
name
of
prince
rocca
romana
the
whole
suite
went
on
board
and
they
began
to
carry
on
to
the
boat
all
the
valuables
which
the
exile
had
been
able
to
save
from
the
shipwreck
of
his
kingdom
first
a
bag
of
gold
weighing
nearly
a
hundred
pounds
a
on
which
were
the
portraits
of
the
king
the
queen
and
their
children
the
deed
of
the
civil
estates
of
his
family
bound
in
velvet
and
adorned
with
his
arms
murat
carried
on
his
person
a
belt
where
some
precious
papers
were
concealed
with
about
a
score
of
unmounted
diamonds
which
he
estimated
himself
to
be
worth
four
millions
when
all
these
preparations
for
departing
were
accomplished
it
was
agreed
that
the
next
day
the
of
august
at
five
a
boat
should
fetch
the
king
to
the
brig
from
a
little
bay
ten
walk
from
the
house
where
he
was
staying
the
king
spent
the
night
making
out
a
route
for
marouin
by
which
he
could
reach
the
queen
who
was
then
in
austria
i
think
it
was
finished
just
as
it
was
time
to
leave
and
on
crossing
the
threshold
of
the
hospitable
house
where
he
had
found
refuge
he
gave
it
to
his
host
slipped
into
a
volume
of
a
pocket
edition
of
voltaire
below
the
story
of
the
king
had
written
the
volume
is
still
in
the
hands
of
marouin
at
toulon
reassure
yourself
dear
caroline
although
unhappy
i
am
free
i
am
departing
but
i
do
not
know
whither
i
am
bound
wherever
i
may
be
my
heart
will
be
with
you
and
my
children
ten
minutes
later
murat
and
his
host
were
waiting
on
the
beach
at
bonette
for
the
boat
which
was
to
take
them
out
to
the
ship
they
waited
until
midday
and
nothing
appeared
and
yet
on
the
horizon
they
could
see
the
brig
which
was
to
be
his
refuge
unable
to
lie
at
anchor
on
account
of
the
depth
of
water
sailing
along
the
coast
at
the
risk
of
giving
the
alarm
to
the
sentinels
at
midday
the
king
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
lying
on
the
beach
when
a
servant
arrived
bringing
various
refreshments
which
madame
marouin
being
very
uneasy
had
sent
at
all
hazards
to
her
husband
the
king
took
a
glass
of
wine
and
water
and
ate
an
orange
and
got
up
for
a
moment
to
see
whether
the
boat
he
was
expecting
was
nowhere
visible
on
the
vastness
of
the
sea
there
was
not
a
boat
in
sight
only
the
brig
tossing
gracefully
on
the
horizon
impatient
to
be
off
like
a
horse
awaiting
its
master
the
king
sighed
and
lay
down
again
on
the
sand
the
servant
went
back
to
bonette
with
a
message
summoning
brother
to
the
beach
he
arrived
in
a
few
minutes
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
galloped
off
at
full
speed
to
toulon
in
order
to
find
out
from
bonafoux
why
the
boat
had
not
been
sent
to
the
king
on
reaching
the
house
he
found
it
occupied
by
an
armed
force
they
were
making
a
search
for
murat
the
messenger
at
last
made
his
way
through
the
tumult
to
the
person
he
was
in
search
of
and
he
heard
that
the
boat
had
started
at
the
appointed
time
and
that
it
must
have
gone
astray
in
the
creeks
of
saint
louis
and
sainte
marguerite
this
was
in
fact
exactly
what
had
happened
by
five
marouin
had
reported
the
news
to
his
brother
and
the
king
it
was
bad
news
the
king
had
no
courage
left
to
defend
his
life
even
by
flight
he
was
in
a
state
of
prostration
which
sometimes
overwhelms
the
strongest
of
men
incapable
of
making
any
plan
for
his
own
safety
and
leaving
marouin
to
do
the
best
he
could
just
then
a
fisherman
was
coming
into
harbour
singing
marouin
beckoned
to
him
and
he
came
up
marouin
began
by
buying
all
the
fish
then
when
he
had
paid
him
with
a
few
coins
he
let
some
gold
glitter
before
his
eyes
and
offered
him
three
louis
if
he
would
take
a
passenger
to
the
brig
which
was
lying
off
the
the
fisherman
agreed
to
do
it
this
chance
of
escape
gave
back
murat
all
his
strength
he
got
up
embraced
marouin
and
begged
him
to
go
to
the
queen
with
the
volume
of
voltaire
then
he
sprang
into
the
boat
which
instantly
left
the
shore
it
was
already
some
distance
from
the
land
when
the
king
stopped
the
man
who
was
rowing
and
signed
to
marouin
that
he
had
forgotten
something
on
the
beach
lay
a
bag
into
which
murat
had
put
a
magnificent
pair
of
pistols
mounted
with
silver
gilt
which
the
queen
had
given
him
and
which
he
set
great
store
on
as
soon
as
he
was
within
hearing
he
shouted
his
reason
for
returning
to
his
host
marouin
seized
the
valise
and
without
waiting
for
murat
to
land
he
threw
it
into
the
boat
the
bag
flew
open
and
one
of
the
pistols
fell
out
the
fisherman
only
glanced
once
at
the
royal
weapon
but
it
was
enough
to
make
him
notice
its
richness
and
to
arouse
his
suspicions
nevertheless
he
went
on
rowing
towards
the
frigate
marouin
seeing
him
disappear
in
the
distance
left
his
brother
on
the
beach
and
bowing
once
more
to
the
king
returned
to
the
house
to
calm
his
anxieties
and
to
take
the
repose
of
which
he
was
in
much
need
two
hours
later
he
was
awakened
his
house
was
to
be
searched
in
its
turn
by
soldiers
they
searched
every
nook
and
corner
without
finding
a
trace
of
the
king
just
as
they
were
getting
desperate
the
brother
came
in
maroum
smiled
at
him
believing
the
king
to
be
safe
but
by
the
expression
he
saw
that
some
fresh
misfortune
was
in
the
wind
in
the
first
respite
given
him
by
his
visitors
he
went
up
to
his
brother
he
said
hope
the
king
is
on
board
king
is
fifty
yards
away
hidden
in
the
did
he
come
back
fisherman
pretended
he
was
afraid
of
a
sudden
squall
and
refused
to
take
him
off
to
the
scoundrel
the
soldiers
came
in
again
they
spent
the
night
in
fruitless
searching
about
the
house
and
buildings
several
times
they
passed
within
a
few
steps
of
the
king
and
he
could
hear
their
threats
and
imprecations
at
last
half
an
hour
before
dawn
they
went
away
marouin
watched
them
go
and
when
they
were
out
of
sight
he
ran
to
the
king
he
found
him
lying
in
a
corner
a
pistol
clutched
in
each
hand
the
unhappy
man
had
been
overcome
by
fatigue
and
had
fallen
asleep
marouin
hesitated
a
moment
to
bring
him
back
to
his
wandering
tormented
life
but
there
was
not
a
minute
to
lose
he
woke
him
they
went
down
to
the
beach
at
once
a
morning
mist
lay
over
the
sea
they
could
not
see
anything
two
hundred
yards
ahead
they
were
obliged
to
wait
at
last
the
first
sunbeams
began
to
pierce
this
nocturnal
mist
it
slowly
dispersed
gliding
over
the
sea
as
clouds
move
in
the
sky
the
hungry
eye
roved
over
the
tossing
waters
before
him
but
he
saw
nothing
yet
he
could
not
banish
the
hope
that
somewhere
behind
that
moving
curtain
he
would
find
his
refuge
little
by
little
the
horizon
came
into
view
light
wreaths
of
mist
like
smoke
still
floated
about
the
surface
of
the
water
and
in
each
of
them
the
king
thought
he
recognised
the
white
sails
of
his
vessel
the
last
gradually
vanished
the
sea
was
revealed
in
all
its
immensity
it
was
deserted
not
daring
to
delay
any
longer
the
ship
had
sailed
away
in
the
night
said
the
king
die
is
cast
i
will
go
to
the
same
day
marshal
brune
was
assassinated
at
avignon
once
more
on
the
same
beach
at
bonette
in
the
same
bay
where
he
had
awaited
the
boat
in
vain
still
attended
by
his
band
of
faithful
followers
we
find
murat
on
the
august
in
the
same
year
it
was
no
longer
by
napoleon
that
he
was
threatened
it
was
by
louis
xviii
that
he
was
proscribed
it
was
no
longer
the
military
loyalty
of
marshal
brune
who
came
with
tears
in
his
eyes
to
give
notice
of
the
orders
he
had
received
but
the
ungrateful
hatred
of
de
riviere
who
had
set
a
price
francs
on
the
head
of
the
man
who
had
saved
his
own
conspiracy
of
pichegru
de
riviere
had
indeed
written
to
the
of
naples
advising
him
to
abandon
himself
to
the
good
faith
and
humanity
of
the
king
of
france
but
his
vague
invitation
had
not
seemed
sufficient
guarantee
to
the
outlaw
especially
on
the
part
of
one
who
had
allowed
the
assassination
almost
before
his
eyes
of
a
man
who
carried
a
signed
by
himself
murat
knew
of
the
massacre
of
the
mamelukes
at
marseilles
the
assassination
of
brune
at
avignon
he
had
been
warned
the
day
before
by
the
police
of
toulon
that
a
formal
order
for
his
arrest
was
out
thus
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
remain
any
longer
in
france
corsica
with
its
hospitable
towns
its
friendly
mountains
its
impenetrable
forests
was
hardly
fifty
leagues
distant
he
must
reach
corsica
and
wait
in
its
towns
mountains
and
forests
until
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
should
decide
the
fate
of
the
man
they
had
called
brother
for
seven
years
at
ten
at
night
the
king
went
down
to
the
shore
the
boat
which
was
to
take
him
across
had
not
reached
the
rendezvous
but
this
time
there
was
not
the
slightest
fear
that
it
would
fail
the
bay
had
been
reconnoitred
during
the
day
by
three
men
devoted
to
the
fallen
fortunes
of
the
blancard
langlade
and
donadieu
all
three
naval
officers
men
of
ability
and
warm
heart
who
had
sworn
by
their
own
lives
to
convey
murat
to
corsica
and
who
were
in
fact
risking
their
lives
in
order
to
accomplish
their
promise
murat
saw
the
deserted
shore
without
uneasiness
indeed
this
delay
afforded
him
a
few
more
moments
of
patriotic
satisfaction
on
this
little
patch
of
land
this
strip
of
sand
the
unhappy
exile
clung
to
his
mother
france
for
once
his
foot
touched
the
vessel
which
was
to
carry
him
away
his
separation
from
france
would
be
long
if
not
eternal
he
started
suddenly
amidst
these
thoughts
and
sighed
he
had
just
perceived
a
sail
gliding
over
the
waves
like
a
phantom
through
the
transparent
darkness
of
the
southern
night
then
a
song
was
heard
murat
recognised
the
appointed
signal
and
answered
it
by
burning
the
priming
of
a
pistol
and
the
boat
immediately
ran
inshore
but
as
she
drew
three
feet
of
water
she
was
obliged
to
stop
ten
or
twelve
feet
from
the
beach
two
men
dashed
into
the
water
and
reached
the
beach
while
a
third
remained
crouching
in
the
wrapped
in
his
my
good
friends
said
the
king
going
towards
blancard
and
langlade
until
he
felt
the
waves
wet
his
feet
moment
is
come
is
it
not
the
wind
is
favourable
the
sea
calm
we
must
get
to
answered
langlade
we
must
start
and
yet
perhaps
it
would
be
wiser
to
wait
till
asked
murat
langlade
did
not
answer
but
turning
towards
the
west
he
raised
his
hand
and
according
to
the
habit
of
sailors
he
whistled
to
call
the
wind
no
good
said
donadieu
who
had
remained
in
the
boat
are
the
first
gusts
you
will
have
more
than
you
know
what
to
do
with
in
a
minute
take
care
langlade
take
care
sometimes
in
calling
the
wind
you
wake
up
a
murat
started
for
he
thought
that
this
warning
which
rose
from
the
sea
had
been
given
him
by
the
spirit
of
the
waters
but
the
impression
was
a
passing
one
and
he
recovered
himself
in
a
moment
the
better
he
said
more
wind
we
have
the
faster
we
shall
answered
langlade
god
knows
where
it
will
take
us
if
it
goes
on
shifting
like
start
sire
said
blancard
adding
his
voice
to
those
of
his
two
companions
why
not
see
that
bank
of
black
cloud
there
you
well
at
sunset
it
was
hardly
visible
now
it
covers
a
good
part
of
the
sky
in
an
hour
there
be
a
star
to
be
you
afraid
asked
murat
answered
langlade
what
of
the
storm
i
might
as
well
ask
if
your
majesty
is
afraid
of
a
we
have
demurred
solely
on
your
account
sire
do
you
think
seadogs
like
ourselves
would
delay
on
account
of
the
storm
let
us
go
cried
murat
with
a
sigh
marouin
god
alone
can
reward
you
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
i
am
at
your
orders
at
these
words
the
two
sailors
seized
the
king
end
hoisted
him
on
to
their
shoulders
and
carried
him
into
the
sea
in
another
moment
he
was
on
board
langlade
and
blancard
sprang
in
behind
him
donadieu
remained
at
the
helm
the
two
other
officers
undertook
the
management
of
the
boat
and
began
their
work
by
unfurling
the
sails
immediately
the
pinnace
seemed
to
rouse
herself
like
a
horse
at
touch
of
the
spur
the
sailors
cast
a
careless
glance
back
and
murat
feeling
that
they
were
sailing
away
turned
towards
his
host
and
called
for
a
last
have
your
route
as
far
as
trieste
do
not
forget
my
wife
keep
you
sire
murmured
marouin
and
for
some
time
thanks
to
the
white
sail
which
gleamed
through
the
darkness
he
could
follow
with
his
eyes
the
boat
which
was
rapidly
disappearing
at
last
it
vanished
altogether
marouin
lingered
on
the
shore
though
he
could
see
nothing
then
he
heard
a
cry
made
faint
by
the
distance
it
was
last
adieu
to
france
when
marouin
was
telling
me
these
details
one
evening
on
the
very
spot
where
it
all
happened
though
twenty
years
had
passed
he
remembered
clearly
the
slightest
incidents
of
the
embarkation
that
night
from
that
moment
he
assured
me
that
a
presentiment
of
misfortune
seized
him
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
from
the
shore
and
several
times
he
longed
to
call
the
king
back
but
like
a
man
in
a
dream
he
opened
his
mouth
without
being
able
to
utter
a
sound
he
was
afraid
of
being
thought
foolish
and
it
was
not
until
one
that
is
two
and
a
half
hours
after
the
departure
of
the
he
went
home
with
a
sad
and
heavy
heart
the
adventurous
navigators
had
taken
the
course
from
toulon
to
bastia
and
at
first
it
seemed
to
the
king
that
the
predictions
were
belied
the
wind
instead
of
getting
up
fell
little
by
little
and
two
hours
after
the
departure
the
boat
was
rocking
without
moving
forward
or
backward
on
the
waves
which
were
sinking
from
moment
to
moment
murat
sadly
watched
the
phosphorescent
furrow
trailing
behind
the
little
boat
he
had
nerved
himself
to
face
a
storm
but
not
a
dead
calm
and
without
even
interrogating
his
companions
of
whose
uneasiness
he
took
no
account
he
lay
down
in
the
boat
wrapped
in
his
cloak
closing
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
asleep
and
following
the
flow
of
his
thoughts
which
were
far
more
tumultuous
than
that
of
the
waters
soon
the
two
sailors
thinking
him
asleep
joined
the
pilot
and
sitting
down
beside
the
helm
they
began
to
consult
together
were
wrong
langlade
said
donadieu
choosing
a
craft
like
this
which
is
either
too
small
or
else
too
big
in
an
open
boat
we
can
never
weather
a
storm
and
without
oars
we
can
never
make
any
way
in
a
god
i
had
no
choice
i
was
obliged
to
take
what
i
could
get
and
if
it
had
not
been
the
season
for
i
might
not
even
have
got
this
wretched
pinnace
or
rather
i
should
have
had
to
go
into
the
harbour
to
find
it
and
they
keep
such
a
sharp
lookout
that
i
might
well
have
gone
in
without
coming
out
least
it
is
seaworthy
said
blancard
you
know
what
nails
and
planks
are
when
they
have
been
soaked
in
for
ten
years
on
any
ordinary
occasion
a
man
would
rather
not
go
in
her
from
marseilles
to
the
chateau
but
on
an
occasion
like
this
one
would
willingly
go
round
the
world
in
a
said
donadieu
the
sailors
listened
a
distant
growl
was
heard
but
it
was
so
faint
that
only
the
experienced
ear
of
a
sailor
could
have
distinguished
it
yes
said
langlade
is
a
warning
for
those
who
have
legs
or
wings
to
regain
the
homes
and
nests
that
they
ought
never
to
have
we
far
from
the
islands
asked
donadieu
quickly
a
mile
for
for
asked
murat
looking
up
put
in
there
sire
if
we
no
cried
murat
will
not
land
except
in
corsica
i
will
not
leave
france
again
besides
the
sea
is
calm
and
the
wind
is
getting
up
with
the
sails
shouted
donadieu
instantly
langlade
and
blancard
jumped
forward
to
carry
out
the
order
the
sail
slid
down
the
mast
and
fell
in
a
heap
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
are
you
doing
cried
murat
you
forget
that
i
am
king
and
that
i
command
you
said
donadieu
is
a
king
more
powerful
than
there
is
a
voice
which
drowns
voice
of
the
tempest
let
us
save
your
majesty
if
possible
and
demand
nothing
more
of
just
then
a
flash
of
lightning
quivered
along
the
horizon
a
clap
of
thunder
nearer
than
the
first
one
was
heard
a
light
foam
appeared
on
the
surface
of
the
water
and
the
boat
trembled
like
a
living
thing
murat
began
to
understand
that
danger
was
approaching
then
he
got
up
smiling
threw
his
hat
behind
him
shook
back
his
long
hair
and
breathed
in
the
storm
like
the
smell
of
soldier
was
ready
for
the
battle
said
donadieu
have
seen
many
a
battle
but
perhaps
you
have
never
watched
a
storm
if
you
are
curious
about
it
cling
to
the
mast
for
you
have
a
fine
opportunity
ought
i
to
do
said
murat
i
not
help
you
in
any
way
not
just
now
sire
later
you
will
be
useful
at
the
during
this
dialogue
the
storm
had
drawn
near
it
rushed
on
the
travellers
like
a
breathing
out
fire
and
wind
through
its
nostrils
neighing
like
thunder
and
scattering
the
foam
of
the
waves
beneath
its
feet
donadieu
turned
the
rudder
the
boat
yielded
as
if
it
understood
the
necessity
for
prompt
obedience
and
presented
the
poop
to
the
shock
of
wind
then
the
squall
passed
leaving
the
sea
quivering
and
everything
was
calm
again
the
storm
took
breath
that
gust
be
all
asked
murat
your
majesty
that
was
the
only
the
body
of
the
army
will
be
up
are
you
not
going
to
prepare
for
it
asked
the
king
gaily
could
we
do
said
donadieu
have
not
an
inch
of
canvas
to
catch
the
wind
and
as
long
as
we
do
not
make
too
much
water
we
shall
float
like
a
cork
look
indeed
a
second
hurricane
was
on
its
way
bringing
rain
and
lightning
it
was
swifter
than
the
first
donadieu
endeavoured
to
repeat
the
same
manoeuvre
but
he
could
not
turn
before
the
wind
struck
the
boat
the
mast
bent
like
a
reed
the
boat
shipped
a
wave
the
pumps
cried
donadieu
now
is
the
moment
to
help
blancard
langlade
and
murat
seized
their
hats
and
began
to
bale
out
the
boat
the
position
of
the
four
men
was
lasted
three
hours
at
dawn
the
wind
fell
but
the
sea
was
still
high
they
began
to
feel
the
need
of
food
all
the
provisions
had
been
spoiled
by
only
the
wine
had
been
preserved
from
its
contact
the
king
took
a
bottle
and
swallowed
a
little
wine
first
then
he
passed
it
to
his
companions
who
drank
in
their
turn
necessity
had
overcome
etiquette
by
chance
langlade
had
on
him
a
few
chocolates
which
he
offered
to
the
king
murat
divided
them
into
four
equal
parts
and
forced
his
companions
to
take
their
shares
then
when
the
meal
was
over
they
steered
for
corsica
but
the
boat
had
suffered
so
much
that
it
was
improbable
that
it
would
reach
bastia
the
whole
day
passed
without
making
ten
miles
the
boat
was
kept
under
the
jib
as
they
dared
not
hoist
the
mainsail
and
the
wind
was
so
variable
that
much
time
was
lost
in
humouring
its
caprices
by
evening
the
boat
had
drawn
a
considerable
amount
of
water
it
penetrated
between
the
boards
the
handkerchiefs
of
the
crew
served
to
plug
up
the
leaks
and
night
which
was
descending
in
mournful
gloom
wrapped
them
a
second
time
in
darkness
prostrated
with
fatigue
murat
fell
asleep
blancard
and
langlade
took
their
places
beside
donadieu
and
the
three
men
who
seemed
insensible
to
the
calls
of
sleep
and
fatigue
watched
over
his
slumbers
the
night
was
calm
enough
apparently
but
low
grumblings
were
heard
now
and
then
the
three
sailors
looked
at
each
other
strangely
and
then
at
the
king
who
was
sleeping
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
his
cloak
soaked
with
sleeping
as
soundly
as
he
had
slept
on
the
sands
of
egypt
or
the
snows
of
russia
then
one
of
them
got
up
and
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
boat
whistling
between
his
teeth
a
provencal
air
then
after
examining
the
sky
the
waves
and
the
boat
he
went
back
to
his
comrades
and
sat
down
muttering
except
by
a
miracle
we
shall
never
make
the
the
night
passed
through
all
its
phases
at
dawn
there
was
a
vessel
in
sight
sail
cried
donadieu
sail
at
this
cry
the
and
soon
a
little
trading
brig
hove
in
sight
going
from
corsica
to
toulon
donadieu
steered
for
the
brig
blancard
hoisted
enough
sail
to
work
the
boat
and
langlade
ran
to
the
prow
and
held
up
the
cloak
on
the
end
of
a
sort
of
harpoon
soon
the
voyagers
perceived
that
they
had
been
sighted
the
brig
went
about
to
approach
them
and
in
ten
minutes
they
found
themselves
within
fifty
yards
of
it
the
captain
appeared
in
the
bows
then
the
king
hailed
him
and
offered
him
a
substantial
reward
if
he
would
receive
them
on
board
and
take
them
to
corsica
the
captain
listened
to
the
proposal
then
immediately
turning
to
the
crew
he
gave
an
order
in
an
undertone
which
donadieu
could
not
hear
but
which
he
understood
probably
by
the
gesture
for
he
instantly
gave
langlade
and
blancard
the
order
to
make
away
from
the
schooner
they
obeyed
with
the
unquestioning
promptitude
of
sailors
but
the
king
stamped
his
foot
are
you
doing
donadieu
what
are
you
about
you
see
that
she
is
coming
up
to
us
my
she
is
do
as
i
say
langlade
ready
blancard
yes
she
is
coming
upon
us
and
perhaps
i
was
too
late
in
seeing
this
all
all
right
my
part
then
he
forced
over
the
rudder
giving
it
so
violent
a
jerk
that
the
boat
forced
to
change
her
course
suddenly
seemed
to
rear
and
plunge
like
a
horse
struggling
against
the
curb
finally
she
obeyed
a
huge
wave
raised
by
the
giant
bearing
down
on
the
pinnace
carried
it
on
like
a
leaf
and
the
brig
passed
within
a
few
feet
of
the
stern
traitor
cried
the
king
who
had
only
just
begun
to
realise
the
intention
of
the
captain
at
the
same
time
he
pulled
a
pistol
from
his
belt
crying
her
board
her
and
tried
to
fire
on
the
brig
but
the
powder
was
wet
and
would
not
catch
the
king
was
furious
and
went
on
shouting
her
board
her
the
wretch
or
rather
the
imbecile
said
donadieu
took
us
for
pirates
and
wanted
to
sink
if
we
needed
him
to
do
that
indeed
a
single
glance
at
the
boat
showed
that
she
was
beginning
to
make
water
the
escape
which
donadieu
had
made
had
strained
the
boat
terribly
and
the
water
was
pouring
in
by
a
number
of
leaks
between
the
planks
they
had
to
begin
again
bailing
out
with
their
hats
and
went
on
at
it
for
ten
hours
then
for
the
second
time
donadieu
heard
the
consoling
cry
sail
a
sail
the
king
and
his
companions
immediately
left
off
bailing
they
hoisted
the
sails
again
and
steered
for
the
vessel
which
was
coming
towards
them
and
neglected
to
fight
against
the
water
which
was
rising
rapidly
from
that
time
forth
it
was
a
question
of
time
of
minutes
of
seconds
it
was
a
question
of
reaching
the
ship
before
the
boat
foundered
the
vessel
however
seemed
to
understand
the
desperate
position
of
the
men
imploring
help
she
was
coming
up
at
full
speed
langlade
was
the
first
to
recognise
her
she
was
a
government
felucca
plying
between
toulon
and
bastia
langlade
was
a
friend
of
the
captain
and
he
called
his
name
with
the
penetrating
voice
of
desperation
and
he
was
heard
it
was
high
time
the
water
kept
on
rising
and
the
king
and
his
companions
were
already
up
to
their
knees
the
boat
groaned
in
its
it
stood
still
and
began
to
go
round
and
round
just
then
two
or
three
ropes
thrown
from
the
felucca
fell
upon
the
boat
the
king
seized
one
sprang
forward
and
reached
the
he
was
saved
blancard
and
langlade
immediately
followed
donadieu
waited
until
the
last
as
was
his
duty
and
as
he
put
his
foot
on
the
ladder
he
felt
the
other
boat
begin
to
go
under
he
turned
round
with
all
a
calm
and
saw
the
gulf
open
its
jaws
beneath
him
and
then
the
shattered
boat
capsized
and
immediately
disappeared
five
seconds
more
and
the
four
men
who
were
saved
would
have
been
lost
beyond
recall
these
details
are
well
known
to
the
people
of
toulon
and
i
have
heard
them
myself
a
score
of
times
during
the
two
stays
that
i
made
in
that
town
during
and
some
of
the
people
who
related
them
had
them
from
langlade
and
donadieu
themselves
murat
had
hardly
gained
the
deck
before
a
man
came
and
fell
at
his
feet
it
was
a
mameluke
whom
he
had
taken
to
egypt
in
former
years
and
had
since
married
at
castellamare
business
affairs
had
taken
him
to
marseilles
where
by
a
miracle
he
had
escaped
the
massacre
of
his
comrades
and
in
spite
of
his
disguise
and
fatigue
he
had
recognised
his
former
master
his
exclamations
of
joy
prevented
the
king
from
keeping
up
his
incognito
then
senator
casabianca
captain
oletta
a
nephew
of
prince
baciocchi
a
called
boerco
who
were
themselves
fleeing
from
the
massacres
of
the
south
were
all
on
board
the
vessel
and
improvising
a
little
court
they
greeted
the
king
with
the
title
of
it
had
been
a
sudden
embarkation
it
brought
about
a
swift
change
he
was
no
longer
murat
the
exile
he
was
joachim
the
king
of
naples
the
refuge
disappeared
with
the
foundered
boat
in
its
place
naples
and
its
magnificent
gulf
appeared
on
the
horizon
like
a
marvellous
mirage
and
no
doubt
the
primary
idea
of
the
fatal
expedition
of
calabria
was
originated
in
the
first
days
of
exultation
which
followed
those
hours
of
anguish
the
king
however
still
uncertain
of
the
welcome
which
awaited
him
in
corsica
took
the
name
of
the
count
of
campo
melle
and
it
was
under
this
name
that
he
landed
at
bastia
on
the
august
but
this
precaution
was
useless
three
days
after
his
arrival
not
a
soul
but
knew
of
his
presence
in
the
town
crowds
gathered
at
once
and
cries
of
live
joachim
were
heard
and
the
king
fearing
to
disturb
the
public
peace
left
bastia
the
same
evening
with
his
three
companions
and
his
mameluke
two
hours
later
he
arrived
at
viscovato
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
general
franceschetti
who
had
been
in
his
service
during
his
whole
reign
and
who
leaving
naples
at
the
same
time
as
the
king
had
gone
to
corsica
with
his
wife
to
live
with
his
colonna
cicaldi
he
was
in
the
middle
of
supper
when
a
servant
told
him
that
a
stranger
was
asking
to
speak
to
went
out
and
found
murat
wrapped
in
a
military
greatcoat
a
cap
drawn
down
on
his
head
his
beard
grown
long
and
wearing
a
trousers
boots
and
gaiters
the
general
stood
still
in
amazement
murat
fixed
his
great
dark
eyes
on
him
and
then
folding
his
arms
said
he
you
room
at
your
table
for
your
general
who
is
hungry
have
you
a
shelter
under
your
roof
for
your
king
who
is
an
exile
franceschetti
looked
astonished
as
he
recognised
joachim
and
could
only
answer
him
by
falling
on
his
knees
and
kissing
his
hand
from
that
moment
the
house
was
at
disposal
the
news
of
the
arrival
had
hardly
been
handed
about
the
neighbourhood
before
officers
of
all
ranks
hastened
to
viscovato
veterans
who
had
fought
under
him
corsican
hunters
who
were
attracted
by
his
adventurous
character
in
a
few
days
the
house
was
turned
into
a
palace
the
village
into
a
royal
capital
the
island
into
a
kingdom
strange
rumours
were
heard
concerning
intentions
an
army
of
nine
hundred
men
helped
to
give
them
some
amount
of
confirmation
it
was
then
that
blancard
donadieu
and
langlade
took
leave
of
him
murat
wished
to
keep
them
but
they
had
been
vowed
to
the
rescue
of
the
exile
not
to
the
fortunes
of
the
king
we
have
related
how
murat
had
met
one
of
his
former
mamelukes
a
man
called
othello
on
board
the
bastia
mailboat
othello
had
followed
him
to
viscovato
and
the
of
naples
considered
how
to
make
use
of
him
family
relations
recalled
him
naturally
to
castellamare
and
murat
ordered
him
to
return
there
entrusting
to
him
letters
for
persons
on
whose
devotion
he
could
depend
othello
started
and
reached
his
safely
and
thought
he
could
confide
in
him
but
the
latter
was
and
alarmed
the
police
who
made
a
descent
on
othello
one
night
and
seized
the
letters
the
next
day
each
man
to
whom
a
letter
was
addressed
was
arrested
and
ordered
to
answer
murat
as
if
all
was
well
and
to
point
out
salerno
as
the
best
place
for
disembarking
five
out
of
seven
were
dastards
enough
to
obey
the
two
remaining
who
were
two
spanish
brothers
absolutely
refused
they
were
thrown
into
a
dungeon
however
on
the
september
murat
left
viscovato
general
franceschetti
and
several
corsican
officers
served
as
escort
he
took
the
road
to
ajaccio
by
cotone
the
mountains
of
serra
and
bosco
venaco
and
vivaro
by
the
gorges
of
the
forest
of
vezzanovo
and
bogognone
he
was
received
and
feted
like
a
king
everywhere
and
at
the
gates
of
the
towns
he
was
met
by
deputations
who
made
him
speeches
and
saluted
him
with
the
title
of
at
last
on
the
september
he
arrived
at
ajaccio
the
whole
population
awaited
him
outside
the
walls
and
his
entry
into
the
town
was
a
triumphal
procession
he
was
taken
to
the
inn
which
had
been
fixed
upon
beforehand
by
the
quartermasters
it
was
enough
to
turn
the
head
of
a
man
less
impressionable
than
murat
as
for
him
he
was
intoxicated
with
it
as
he
went
into
the
inn
he
held
out
his
hand
to
franceschetti
see
he
said
the
neapolitans
will
do
for
me
by
the
way
the
corsicans
receive
it
was
the
first
mention
which
had
escaped
him
of
his
plans
for
the
future
and
from
that
very
day
he
began
to
give
orders
for
his
departure
they
collected
ten
little
feluccas

waiting
for
the
answers
to
letters

of
the
murat
invited
all
his
officers
to
a
grand
dinner
and
ordered
double
pay
and
double
rations

the
king
was
at
dessert
when
the
arrival
of
maceroni
was
announced
to
him
he
was
the
envoy
of
the
foreign
powers
who
brought
murat
the
answer

he
had
been
awaiting
so
long
at
toulon

he
could
even
inhabit

smiled
as
he
finished
reading
then
he
signed
to
maceroni
to
follow
him
he
led
him
on
to
the
terrace
of
the
house
which
looked
over
the
whole
town
and
over
which
a
banner
floated
as
it
might
on
a
royal
castle
from
thence
they
could
see
ajaccio
all
gay
and
illuminated
the
port
with
its
little
fleet
and
the
streets
crowded
with
people
as
if
it
were
a
hardly
had
the
crowd
set
eyes
on
murat
before
a
universal
cry
arose
live
joachim
brother
of
napoleon
long
live
the
king
of
naples
murat
bowed
and
the
shouts
were
redoubled
and
the
garrison
band
played
the
national
airs
maceroni
did
not
know
how
to
believe
his
own
eyes
and
ears
when
the
king
had
enjoyed
his
astonishment
he
invited
him
to
go
down
to
the
his
staff
were
there
all
in
full
uniform
one
might
have
been
at
caserte
or
at
capo
di
monte
at
last
after
a
hesitation
maceroni
approached
murat
he
said
is
my
answer
to
be
to
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
austria
answered
murat
with
the
lofty
dignity
which
sat
so
well
on
his
fine
face
my
brother
francis
what
you
have
seen
and
heard
and
add
that
i
am
setting
out
this
very
night
to
reconquer
my
kingdom
of
the
letters
which
had
made
murat
resolve
to
leave
corsica
had
been
brought
to
him
by
a
calabrian
named
luidgi
he
had
presented
himself
to
the
king
as
the
envoy
of
the
arab
othello
who
had
been
thrown
into
prison
in
naples
as
we
have
related
as
well
as
the
seven
recipients
of
the
letters
the
answers
written
by
the
head
of
the
neapolitan
police
indicated
the
port
of
salerno
as
the
best
place
for
joachim
to
land
for
king
ferdinand
had
assembled
three
thousand
austrian
troops
at
that
point
not
daring
to
trust
the
neapolitan
soldiers
who
cherished
a
brilliant
and
enthusiastic
memory
of
murat
accordingly
the
flotilla
was
directed
for
the
gulf
of
salerno
but
within
sight
of
the
island
of
capri
a
violent
storm
broke
over
it
and
drove
it
as
far
as
paola
a
little
seaport
situated
ten
miles
from
cosenza
consequently
the
vessels
were
anchored
for
the
night
of
the
of
october
in
a
little
indentation
of
the
coast
not
worthy
of
the
name
of
a
roadstead
the
king
to
remove
all
suspicion
from
the
coastguards
and
the
sicilian
scorridori
small
vessels
fitted
up
as
ordered
that
all
lights
should
be
extinguished
and
that
the
vessels
should
tack
about
during
the
night
but
towards
one
such
a
violent
sprang
up
that
the
expedition
was
driven
out
to
sea
so
that
on
the
at
dawn
the
vessel
was
alone
during
the
morning
they
overhauled
captain
felucca
and
the
two
ships
dropped
anchor
at
four
in
sight
of
in
the
evening
the
king
commanded
ottoviani
a
staff
officer
to
go
ashore
and
reconnoitre
luidgi
offered
to
accompany
him
murat
accepted
his
services
so
ottoviani
and
his
guide
went
ashore
whilst
cicconi
and
his
felucca
put
out
to
sea
in
search
of
the
rest
of
the
fleet
towards
eleven
at
night
the
lieutenant
of
the
watch
descried
a
man
in
the
waves
swimming
to
the
vessel
as
soon
as
he
was
within
hearing
the
lieutenant
hailed
him
the
swimmer
immediately
made
himself
known
it
was
luidgi
they
put
out
the
boat
and
he
came
on
board
then
he
told
them
that
ottoviani
had
been
arrested
and
he
had
only
escaped
himself
by
jumping
into
the
sea
first
idea
was
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
ottoviani
but
luidgi
made
the
king
realise
the
danger
and
uselessness
of
such
an
attempt
nevertheless
joachim
remained
agitated
and
irresolute
until
two
in
the
morning
at
last
he
gave
the
order
to
put
to
sea
again
during
the
manoeuvre
which
effected
this
a
sailor
fell
overboard
and
disappeared
before
they
had
time
to
help
him
decidedly
these
were
ill
omens
on
the
morning
of
the
two
vessels
were
in
sight
the
king
gave
the
order
to
prepare
for
action
but
barbara
recognised
them
as
felucca
and
lugger
which
had
joined
each
other
and
were
keeping
each
other
company
they
hoisted
the
necessary
signals
and
the
two
captains
brought
up
their
vessels
alongside
the
while
they
were
deliberating
as
to
what
route
to
follow
a
boat
came
up
to
vessel
captain
pernice
was
on
board
with
a
lieutenant
they
came
to
ask
the
permission
to
board
his
ship
not
wishing
to
remain
on
for
in
their
opinion
he
was
a
traitor
murat
sent
to
fetch
him
and
in
spite
of
his
protestations
he
was
made
to
descend
into
a
boat
with
fifty
men
and
the
boat
was
moored
to
the
vessel
the
order
was
carried
out
at
once
and
the
little
squadron
advanced
coasting
along
the
shores
of
calabria
without
losing
sight
of
them
but
at
ten
in
the
evening
just
as
they
came
abreast
of
the
gulf
of
captain
courrand
cut
the
rope
which
moored
his
boat
to
the
vessel
and
rowed
away
from
the
fleet
murat
had
thrown
himself
on
to
his
bed
without
undressing
they
brought
him
the
news
he
rushed
up
to
the
deck
and
arrived
in
time
to
see
the
boat
which
was
fleeing
in
the
direction
of
corsica
grow
small
and
vanish
in
the
distance
he
remained
motionless
not
uttering
a
cry
giving
no
signs
of
rage
he
only
sighed
and
let
his
head
fall
on
his
breast
it
was
one
more
leaf
falling
from
the
exhausted
tree
of
his
hopes
general
franceschetti
profited
by
this
hour
of
discouragement
to
advise
him
not
to
land
in
calabria
and
to
go
direct
to
trieste
in
order
to
claim
from
austria
the
refuge
which
had
been
offered
the
king
was
going
through
one
of
those
periods
of
extreme
exhaustion
of
mortal
depression
when
courage
quite
gives
way
he
refused
flatly
at
first
and
there
at
last
agreed
to
do
it
just
then
the
general
perceived
a
sailor
lying
on
some
coils
of
ropes
within
hearing
of
all
they
said
he
interrupted
himself
and
pointed
him
out
to
murat
the
latter
got
up
went
to
see
the
man
and
recognised
luidgi
overcome
with
exhaustion
he
had
fallen
asleep
on
deck
the
king
satisfied
himself
that
the
sleep
was
genuine
and
besides
he
had
full
confidence
in
the
man
the
conversation
which
had
been
interrupted
for
a
moment
was
renewed
it
was
agreed
that
without
saying
anything
about
the
new
plans
they
would
clear
cape
spartivento
and
enter
the
adriatic
then
the
king
and
the
general
went
below
again
to
the
lower
deck
the
next
day
the
october
they
found
themselves
abreast
of
pizzo
when
joachim
questioned
by
barbara
as
to
what
he
proposed
to
do
gave
the
order
to
steer
for
messina
barbara
answered
that
he
was
ready
to
obey
but
that
they
were
in
need
of
food
and
water
consequently
he
offered
to
go
on
board
vessel
and
to
land
with
him
to
get
stores
the
king
agreed
barbara
asked
for
the
passports
which
he
had
received
from
the
allied
powers
in
order
he
said
not
to
be
molested
by
the
local
authorities
these
documents
were
too
important
for
murat
to
consent
to
part
with
them
perhaps
the
king
was
beginning
to
suspect
he
refused
barbara
insisted
murat
ordered
him
to
land
without
the
papers
barbara
flatly
refused
the
king
accustomed
to
being
obeyed
raised
his
to
strike
the
maltese
but
changing
his
resolution
he
ordered
the
soldiers
to
prepare
their
arms
the
officers
to
put
on
full
uniform
he
himself
set
the
example
the
disembarkation
was
decided
upon
and
pizzo
was
to
become
the
golfe
juan
of
the
new
napoleon
consequently
the
vessels
were
steered
for
land
the
king
got
down
into
a
boat
with
soldiers
and
three
servants
amongst
whom
was
luidgi
as
they
drew
near
the
shore
general
franceschetti
made
a
movement
as
if
to
land
but
murat
stopped
him
is
for
me
to
land
first
he
said
and
he
sprang
on
shore
he
was
dressed
in
a
coat
white
breeches
and
a
belt
carrying
two
pistols
a
hat
with
a
cockade
fastened
in
with
a
clasp
made
of
fourteen
brilliants
and
lastly
he
carried
under
his
arm
the
banner
round
which
he
hoped
to
rally
his
partisans
the
town
clock
of
pizzo
struck
ten
murat
went
straight
up
to
the
town
from
which
he
was
hardly
a
hundred
yards
distant
he
followed
the
wide
stone
staircase
which
led
up
to
it
it
was
sunday
mass
was
about
to
be
celebrated
and
the
whole
population
had
assembled
in
the
great
square
when
he
arrived
no
one
recognised
him
and
everyone
gazed
with
astonishment
at
the
fine
officer
presently
he
saw
amongst
the
peasants
a
former
sergeant
of
his
who
had
served
in
his
guard
at
naples
he
walked
straight
up
to
him
and
put
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
he
said
you
recognise
me
but
as
the
man
made
no
answer
am
joachim
murat
i
am
your
king
he
said
be
the
honour
to
shout
live
joachim
suite
instantly
made
the
air
ring
with
acclamations
but
the
calabrians
remained
silent
and
not
one
of
his
comrades
took
up
the
cry
for
which
the
king
himself
had
given
the
signal
on
the
contrary
a
low
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd
murat
well
understood
this
forerunner
of
the
storm
he
said
to
tavella
you
cry
live
joachim
you
can
at
least
fetch
me
a
horse
and
from
sergeant
i
will
promote
you
to
be
tavella
walked
away
without
answering
but
instead
of
carrying
out
the
behest
went
into
his
house
and
did
not
appear
again
in
the
meantime
the
people
were
massing
together
without
evincing
any
of
the
sympathy
that
the
king
had
hoped
for
he
felt
that
he
was
lost
if
he
did
not
act
instantly
monteleone
he
cried
springing
forward
towards
the
road
which
led
to
that
town
monteleone
shouted
his
officers
and
men
as
they
followed
him
and
the
crowd
persistently
silent
opened
to
let
them
pass
but
they
had
hardly
left
the
square
before
a
great
disturbance
broke
out
a
man
named
giorgio
pellegrino
came
out
of
his
house
with
a
gun
and
crossed
the
square
shouting
your
arms
he
knew
that
captain
trenta
capelli
commanding
the
cosenza
garrison
was
just
then
in
pizzo
and
he
was
going
to
warn
him
the
cry
arms
had
more
effect
on
the
crowd
than
the
cry
live
joachim
every
calabrian
possesses
a
gun
and
each
one
ran
to
fetch
his
and
when
trenta
capelli
and
giorgio
pellegrino
came
back
to
the
square
they
found
nearly
two
hundred
armed
men
there
they
placed
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
column
and
hastened
forward
in
pursuit
of
the
king
they
came
up
with
him
about
ten
minutes
from
the
square
where
the
bridge
is
nowadays
seeing
them
murat
stopped
and
waited
for
them
trenta
capelli
advanced
sword
in
hand
towards
the
king
said
the
latter
you
exchange
your
epaulettes
for
a
cry
live
joachim
and
follow
me
with
these
brave
fellows
to
said
trenta
capelli
are
the
faithful
subjects
of
king
ferdinand
and
we
come
to
fight
you
and
not
to
bear
you
company
give
yourself
up
if
you
would
prevent
murat
looked
at
the
captain
with
an
expression
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
then
without
deigning
to
answer
he
signed
to
cagelli
to
move
away
while
his
other
hand
went
to
his
pistol
giotgio
pellegrino
perceived
the
movement
captain
down
he
cried
the
captain
obeyed
immediately
a
bullet
whistled
over
his
head
and
brushed
head
commanded
franceschetti
with
your
arms
cried
murat
waving
his
handkerchief
in
his
right
hand
he
made
a
step
towards
the
peasants
but
at
the
same
moment
a
number
of
shots
were
fired
an
officer
and
two
or
three
men
fell
in
a
case
like
this
when
blood
has
begun
to
flow
there
is
no
stopping
it
murat
knew
this
fatal
truth
and
his
course
of
action
was
rapidly
decided
on
before
him
he
had
five
hundred
armed
men
and
behind
him
a
precipice
thirty
feet
high
he
sprang
from
the
jagged
rock
on
which
he
was
standing
and
alighting
on
the
sand
jumped
up
safe
and
sound
general
franceschetti
and
his
campana
were
able
to
accomplish
the
jump
in
the
same
way
and
all
three
went
rapidly
down
to
the
sea
through
the
little
wood
which
lay
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
shore
and
which
hid
them
for
a
few
moments
from
their
enemies
as
they
came
out
of
the
wood
a
fresh
discharge
greeted
them
bullets
whistled
round
them
but
no
one
was
hit
and
the
three
fugitives
went
on
down
to
the
beach
it
was
only
then
that
the
king
perceived
that
the
boat
which
had
brought
them
to
land
had
gone
off
again
the
three
ships
which
composed
the
fleet
far
from
remaining
to
guard
his
landing
were
sailing
away
at
full
speed
into
the
open
sea
the
maltese
barbara
was
going
off
not
only
with
fortune
but
with
his
hopes
likewise
his
salvation
his
very
life
they
could
not
believe
in
such
treachery
and
the
king
took
it
for
some
manoeuvre
of
seamanship
and
seeing
a
drawn
up
on
the
beach
on
some
nets
he
called
to
his
two
companions
that
boat
they
all
began
to
push
it
down
to
the
sea
with
the
energy
of
despair
the
strength
of
agony
no
one
had
dared
to
leap
from
the
rock
in
pursuit
of
them
their
enemies
forced
to
make
a
detour
left
them
a
few
moments
of
liberty
but
soon
shouts
were
heard
giorgio
pellegrino
trenta
capelli
followed
by
the
whole
population
of
pizzo
rushed
out
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
paces
from
where
murat
franceschetti
and
campana
were
straining
themselves
to
make
the
boat
glide
down
the
sand
these
cries
were
immediately
followed
by
a
volley
campana
fell
with
a
bullet
through
his
heart
the
boat
however
was
launched
franceschetti
sprang
into
it
murat
was
about
to
follow
but
he
had
not
observed
that
the
spurs
of
his
had
caught
in
the
meshes
of
the
net
the
boat
yielding
to
the
push
he
gave
it
glided
away
and
the
king
fell
head
foremost
with
his
feet
on
land
and
his
face
in
the
water
before
he
had
time
to
pick
himself
up
the
populace
had
fallen
on
him
in
one
instant
they
had
torn
away
his
epaulettes
his
banner
and
his
coat
and
would
have
torn
him
to
bits
himself
had
not
giorgio
pellegrino
and
trenta
capelli
taken
him
under
their
protection
and
giving
him
an
arm
on
each
side
defended
him
in
their
turn
against
the
people
thus
he
crossed
the
square
as
a
prisoner
where
an
hour
before
he
had
walked
as
a
king
his
captors
took
him
to
the
castle
he
was
pushed
into
the
common
prison
the
door
was
shut
upon
him
and
the
king
found
himself
among
thieves
and
murderers
who
not
knowing
him
took
him
for
a
companion
in
crime
and
greeted
him
with
foul
language
and
hoots
of
derision
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
door
of
the
gaol
opened
and
commander
mattei
came
in
he
found
murat
standing
with
head
proudly
erect
and
folded
arms
there
was
an
expression
of
indefinable
loftiness
in
this
man
whose
face
was
stained
with
blood
and
bespattered
with
mud
mattei
bowed
before
him
said
murat
recognising
his
rank
by
his
epaulettes
round
you
and
tell
me
whether
this
is
a
prison
for
a
then
a
strange
thing
happened
the
criminals
who
believing
murat
their
accomplice
had
welcomed
him
with
vociferations
and
laughter
now
bent
before
his
royal
majesty
which
had
not
overawed
pellegrino
and
trenta
capelli
and
retired
silently
to
the
depths
of
their
dungeon
misfortune
had
invested
murat
with
a
new
power
commander
mattei
murmured
some
excuse
and
invited
murat
to
follow
him
to
a
room
that
he
had
had
prepared
for
him
but
before
going
out
murat
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
handful
of
gold
and
let
it
fall
in
a
shower
in
the
midst
of
the
gaol
he
said
turning
towards
the
prisoners
shall
not
be
said
that
you
have
received
a
visit
from
a
king
prisoner
and
crownless
as
he
is
without
having
received
live
joachim
cried
the
prisoners
murat
smiled
bitterly
those
same
words
repeated
by
the
same
number
of
voices
an
hour
before
in
the
public
square
instead
of
resounding
in
the
prison
would
have
made
him
king
of
naples
the
most
important
events
proceed
sometimes
from
such
mere
trifles
that
it
seems
as
if
god
and
the
devil
must
throw
dice
for
the
life
or
death
of
men
for
the
rise
or
fall
of
empires
murat
followed
commander
mattei
he
led
him
to
a
little
room
which
the
porter
had
put
at
his
disposal
mattei
was
going
to
retire
when
murat
called
him
back
he
said
want
a
scented
it
will
be
difficult
to
are
fifty
ducats
let
someone
buy
all
the
eau
de
cologne
that
can
be
obtained
let
some
tailors
be
sent
to
will
be
impossible
to
find
anyone
here
capable
of
making
anything
but
a
someone
to
monteleone
to
fetch
them
from
the
commander
bowed
and
went
out
murat
was
in
his
bath
when
the
lavaliere
alcala
was
announced
a
general
and
governor
of
the
town
he
had
sent
damask
coverlets
curtains
and
murat
was
touched
by
this
attention
and
it
gave
him
fresh
composure
at
two
the
same
day
general
nunziante
arrived
from
with
three
thousand
men
murat
greeted
his
old
acquaintance
with
pleasure
but
at
the
first
word
the
king
perceived
that
he
was
before
his
judge
and
that
he
had
not
come
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
visit
but
to
make
an
official
inquiry
murat
contented
himself
with
stating
that
he
had
been
on
his
way
from
corsica
to
trieste
with
a
passport
from
the
emperor
of
austria
when
stormy
weather
and
lack
of
provisions
had
forced
him
to
put
into
pizzo
all
other
questions
murat
met
with
a
stubborn
silence
then
at
least
wearied
by
his
he
said
you
lend
me
some
clothes
after
my
bath
the
general
understood
that
he
could
expect
no
more
information
and
bowing
to
the
king
he
went
out
ten
minutes
later
a
complete
uniform
was
brought
to
murat
he
put
it
on
immediately
asked
for
a
pen
and
ink
wrote
to
the
of
the
austrian
troops
at
naples
to
the
english
ambassador
and
to
his
wife
to
tell
them
of
his
detention
at
pizzo
these
letters
written
he
got
up
and
paced
his
room
for
some
time
in
evident
agitation
at
last
needing
fresh
air
he
opened
the
window
there
was
a
view
of
the
very
beach
where
he
had
been
captured
two
men
were
digging
a
hole
in
the
sand
at
the
foot
of
the
little
redoubt
murat
watched
them
mechanically
when
the
two
men
had
finished
they
went
into
a
neighbouring
house
and
soon
came
out
bearing
a
corpse
in
their
arms
the
king
searched
his
memory
and
indeed
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
the
midst
of
that
terrible
scene
he
had
seen
someone
fall
but
who
it
was
he
no
longer
remembered
the
corpse
was
quite
without
covering
but
by
the
long
black
hair
and
youthful
outlines
the
king
recognised
campana
the
he
had
always
loved
best
this
scene
watched
from
a
prison
window
in
the
twilight
this
solitary
burial
on
the
shore
in
the
sand
moved
murat
more
deeply
than
his
own
fate
great
tears
filled
his
eyes
and
fell
silently
down
the
leonine
face
at
that
moment
general
nunziante
came
in
and
surprised
him
with
outstretched
arms
and
face
bathed
with
tears
murat
heard
him
enter
and
turned
round
and
seeing
the
old
surprise
general
he
said
weep
i
weep
for
that
boy
just
entrusted
to
me
by
his
parents
whose
death
i
have
brought
about
i
weep
for
that
vast
brilliant
future
which
is
buried
in
an
unknown
grave
in
an
country
on
a
hostile
shore
oh
campana
campana
if
ever
i
am
king
again
i
will
raise
you
a
royal
the
general
had
had
dinner
served
in
an
adjacent
room
murat
followed
him
and
sat
down
to
table
but
he
could
not
eat
the
sight
which
he
had
just
witnessed
had
made
him
heartbroken
and
yet
without
a
line
on
his
brow
that
man
had
been
through
the
battles
of
aboukir
eylau
and
moscow
after
dinner
murat
went
into
his
room
again
gave
his
various
letters
to
general
nunziante
and
begged
to
be
left
alone
the
general
went
away
murat
paced
round
his
room
several
times
walking
with
long
steps
and
pausing
from
time
to
time
before
the
window
but
without
opening
it
at
last
he
overcame
a
deep
reluctance
put
his
hand
on
the
bolt
and
drew
the
lattice
towards
him
it
was
a
calm
clear
night
one
could
see
the
whole
shore
he
looked
for
grave
two
dogs
scratching
the
sand
showed
him
the
spot
the
king
shut
the
window
violently
and
without
undressing
threw
himself
onto
his
bed
at
last
fearing
that
his
agitation
would
be
attributed
to
personal
alarm
he
undressed
and
went
to
bed
to
sleep
or
seem
to
sleep
all
night
on
the
morning
of
the
the
tailors
whom
murat
had
asked
for
arrived
he
ordered
a
great
many
clothes
taking
the
trouble
to
explain
all
the
details
suggested
by
his
fastidious
taste
he
was
thus
employed
when
general
nunziante
came
in
he
listened
sadly
to
the
commands
he
had
just
received
telegraphic
despatches
ordering
him
to
try
the
king
of
naples
by
as
a
public
enemy
but
he
found
the
king
so
confident
so
tranquil
almost
cheerful
indeed
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
announce
his
trial
to
him
and
took
upon
himself
to
delay
the
opening
of
operation
until
he
received
written
instructions
these
arrived
on
the
evening
of
the
they
were
couched

was
sound
asleep
stratti
was
going
away
again
when
he
stumbled
against
a
chair
the
noise
awoke
murat
do
you
want
with
me
captain
asked
the
king
stratti
tried
to
speak
but
his
voice
failed
him

from

murat
trial
by
whose
order
will
sentence
be
pronounced
if
you
please
where
will
they
find
peers
to
judge
me
if
they
consider
me
as
a
king
i
must
have
a
tribunal
of
kings
if
i
am
a
marshal
of
france
i
must
have
a
court
of
marshals
if
i
am
a
general
and
that
is
the
least
i
can
be
i
must
have
a
jury
of
you
are
declared
a
public
enemy
and
as
such
you
are
liable
to
be
judged
by
that
is
the
law
which
you
instituted
yourself
for
law
was
made
for
brigands
and
not
for
crowned
heads
sir
said
murat
scornfully
am
ready
let
them
butcher
me
if
they
like
i
did
not
think
king
ferdinand
capable
of
such
an
will
you
not
hear
the
names
of
your
judges
sir
i
will
it
must
be
a
curious
list
read
it
i
am
captain
stratti
read
out
the
names
that
we
have
enumerated
murat
listened
with
a
disdainful
smile
he
said
as
the
captain
finished
seems
that
every
precaution
has
been
sire
you
know
that
all
these
men
with
the
exception
of
francesco
froio
the
reporter
owe
their
promotion
to
me
they
will
be
afraid
of
being
accused
of
sparing
me
out
of
gratitude
and
save
one
voice
perhaps
the
sentence
will
be
suppose
you
were
to
appear
before
the
court
to
plead
your
own
cause
sir
silence
said
murat
could
not
officially
recognise
the
judges
you
have
named
without
tearing
too
many
pages
of
history
such
tribunal
is
quite
incompetent
i
should
be
disgraced
if
i
appeared
before
it
i
know
i
could
not
save
my
life
let
me
at
least
preserve
my
royal
at
this
moment
lieutenant
francesco
froio
came
in
to
interrogate
the
prisoner
asking
his
name
his
age
and
his
nationality
hearing
these
questions
murat
rose
with
an
expression
of
sublime
dignity

joachim
napoleon
king
of
the
two
sicilies
he
answered
i
order
you
to
leave
the
registrar
obeyed
then
murat
partially
dressed
himself
and
asked
stratti
if
he
could
write
a
farewell
to
his
wife
and
children
the
captain
no
longer
able
to
speak
answered
by
an
affirmative
sign
then
joachim
sat
down
to
the
table
and
wrote
this
letter

of
my
heart
fatal
moment
has
come
i
am
to

hour

been
i
bless
you
all
never
curse
my
memory
remember
that
the
worst
pang
of
my
agony
is
in

far
from
my
children
far
from
my
wife
without
a
friend
to
close
my
eyes
farewell

caroline
farewell

i
send

my
blessing
my
most
tender
tears
my
last

farewell
never
forget
your
unhappy
father
we
can
guarantee
the
authenticity
of
this
letter
having
copied
it
ourselves
at
pizzo
from
the
lavaliere
copy
of
the
original
then
he
cut
off
a
lock
of
his
hair
and
put
it
in
his
letter
just
then
general
nunziante
came
in
murat
went
to
him
and
held
out
his
hand
he
said
are
a
father
you
are
a
husband
one
day
you
will
know
what
it
is
to
part
from
your
wife
and
sons
swear
to
me
that
this
letter
shall
be
my
epaulettes
said
the
general
wiping
his
eyes
madame
murat
never
received
this
letter
come
courage
general
said
murat
are
soldiers
we
know
how
to
face
death
one
will
let
me
give
the
order
to
fire
will
you
not
the
general
signed
acquiescence
just
then
the
registrar
came
in
with
the
sentence
in
his
hand
murat
guessed
what
it
was
sir
he
said
coldly
am
the
registrar
obeyed
murat
was
right
the
sentence
of
death
had
been
carried
with
only
one
dissentient
voice
when
the
reading
was
finished
the
king
turned
again
to
nunziante
he
said
that
i
distinguish
in
my
mind
the
instrument
which
strikes
me
and
the
hand
that
wields
that
instrument
i
should
never
have
thought
that
ferdinand
would
have
had
me
shot
like
a
dog
he
does
not
hesitate
apparently
before
such
infamy
very
well
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
i
have
challenged
my
judges
but
not
my
executioners
what
time
have
you
fixed
for
my
execution
you
fix
it
yourself
sir
said
the
general
murat
pulled
out
a
watch
on
which
there
was
a
portrait
of
his
wife
by
chance
he
turned
up
the
portrait
and
not
the
face
of
the
watch
he
gazed
at
it
tenderly
general
he
said
showing
it
to
nunziante
is
a
portrait
of
the
queen
you
know
her
is
it
not
like
her
the
general
turned
away
his
head
murat
sighed
and
put
away
the
watch
sire
said
the
registrar
time
have
you
fixed
yes
said
murat
smiling
forgot
why
i
took
out
my
watch
when
i
saw
then
he
looked
at
his
watch
again
but
this
time
at
its
face
it
shall
be
at
four
if
you
like
it
is
past
three
i
ask
for
fifty
minutes
is
that
too
much
sir
the
registrar
bowed
and
went
out
the
general
was
about
to
follow
him
i
never
see
you
again
nunziante
said
murat
orders
are
to
be
present
at
your
death
sire
but
i
can
not
do
well
general
i
will
dispense
with
your
presence
at
the
last
moment
but
i
should
like
to
say
farewell

more
and
to
embrace

be
near

me
there
are
two
priests
murat
made
an
impatient
movement

receive
them
continued
the
general
bring
them
the
general
went
out
a
moment
later
two
priests
appeared
in
the
doorway
one
of
them
was
called
francesco
pellegrino
uncle
of
the
man
who
had
caused
the
death
the
other
was
don
antonio
masdea
do

to
ask
you
if
you
are
dying

christian

as
a
soldier

don
francesco
pellegrino
retired
no
doubt
he
felt
ill
at
ease
before
joachim
but
antonio
masdea
remained
at
the
door
you
not
hear
me
asked
the
king
indeed

the
old
man
permit
me
sire
to
hope
that
it
was
not
your
last
word
to
me
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
see
you
or
beg
something
of
you
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
ask
a
favour
of
was
that
your
majesty
came
to
pizzo
in
i
asked
you
for
francs
to
enable
us
to
finish
our
church
your
majesty
sent
me
must
have
foreseen
that
i
should
be
buried
there
said
murat
smiling
sire
i
should
like
to
think
that
you
did
not
refuse
my
second
boon
any
more
than
my
first
sire
i
entreat
you
on
my
the
old
man
fell
at
feet
as
a
christian
would
give
you
pleasure
then
would
it
said
the
king
i
would
give
the
few
short
days
remaining
to
me
if
god
would
grant
that
his
holy
spirit
should
fall
upon
you
in
your
last
said
murat
my
confession
i
accuse
myself
of
having
been
disobedient
to
my
parents
as
a
child
since
i
reached
manhood
i
have
done
nothing
to
reproach
myself
will
you
give
me
an
attestation
that
you
die
in
the
christian
faith
said
murat
and
he
took
a
pen
and
wrote
joachim
murat
die
a
christian
believing
in
the
holy
catholic
church
apostolic
and
he
signed
it
father
continued
the
king
you

a
third
favour
to
ask
of
me
make
haste
for
in
half
an
hour
it
will
be
too
indeed
the
castle
clock
was
striking
three
the
priest
signed
that
he
had
finished
leave
me
alone
said
murat
and
the
old
man
went
out
murat
paced
his
room
for
a
few
moments
then
he
sat
down
on
his
bed
and
let
his
head
fall
into
his
hands
doubtless
during
the
quarter
of
an
hour
he
remained
thus
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
he
saw
his
whole
life
pass
before
him
from
the
inn
where
he
had
started
to
the
palace
he
had
reached
no
doubt
his
adventurous
career
unrolled
itself
before
him
like
some
golden
dream
some
brilliant
fiction
some
tale
from
the
arabian
nights
his
life
gleamed
athwart
the
storm
like
a
rainbow
and
like
a
its
two
extremities
were
lost
in
clouds
of
birth
and
death
at
last
he
roused
himself
from
this
inward
contemplation
and
lifted
a
pale
but
tranquil
face
then
he
went
to
the
glass
and
arranged
his
hair
his
strange
characteristics
never
left
him
the
affianced
of
death
he
was
adorning
himself
to
meet
his
bride
four
struck
murat
went
to
the
door
himself
and
opened
it
general
nunziante
was
waiting
for
him
you
general
said
murat
have
kept
your
word
kiss
me
and
go
at
once
if
you
the
general
threw
himself
into
the
arms
weeping
and
utterly
unable
to
speak
said
murat
see
i
am
it
was
this
very
calmness
which
broke
the
heart
he
dashed
out
of
the
corridor
and
left
the
castle
running
like
a
madman
then
the
king
walked
out
into
the
courtyard
everything
was
ready
for
the
execution
nine
men
and
a
corporal
were
ranged
before
the
door
of
the
council
chamber
opposite
them
was
a
wall
twelve
feet
high
three
feet
away
from
the
wall
was
a
stone
block
murat
mounted
it
thus
raising
himself
about
a
foot
above
the
soldiers
who
were
to
execute
him
then
he
took
out
his
watch
madame
murat
recovered
this
watch
at
the
price
of
louis
kissed
his
portrait
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
it
gave
the
order
to
fire
at
the
word
of
command
five
out
of
the
nine
men
fired
murat
remained
standing
the
soldiers
had
been
ashamed
to
fire
on
their
king
and
had
aimed
over
his
head
that
moment
perhaps
displayed
most
gloriously
the
lionlike
courage
which
was
special
attribute
his
face
never
changed
he
did
not
move
a
muscle
only
gazing
at
the
soldiers
with
an
expression
of
mingled
bitterness
and
gratitude
he
said
you
my
friends
since
sooner
or
later
you
will
be
obliged
to
aim
true
do
not
prolong
my
all
i
ask
you
is
to
aim
at
the
heart
and
spare
the
face
with
the
same
voice
the
same
calm
the
same
expression
he
repeated
the
fatal
words
one
after
another
without
lagging
without
hastening
as
if
he
were
giving
an
accustomed
command
but
this
time
happier
than
the
first
at
the
word
he
fell
pierced
by
eight
bullets
without
a
sigh
without
a
movement
still
holding
the
watch
in
his
left
hand
the
soldiers
took
up
the
body
and
laid
it
on
the
bed
where
ten
minutes
before
he
had
been
sitting
and
the
captain
put
a
guard
at
the
door
in
the
evening
a
man
presented
himself
asking
to
go
into
the
the
sentinel
refused
to
let
him
in
and
he
demanded
an
interview
with
the
governor
of
the
prison
led
before
him
he
produced
an
order
the
commander
read
it
with
surprise
and
disgust
but
after
reading
it
he
led
the
man
to
the
door
where
he
had
been
refused
entrance
the
signor
luidgi
he
said
to
the
sentinel
ten
minutes
had
hardly
elapsed
before
he
came
out
again
holding
a
bloodstained
handkerchief
containing
something
to
which
the
sentinel
could
not
give
a
name
an
hour
later
the
carpenter
brought
the
coffin
which
was
to
contain
the
remains
the
workman
entered
the
room
but
instantly
called
the
sentinel
in
a
voice
of
indescribable
terror
the
sentinel
half
opened
the
door
to
see
what
had
caused
the
panic
the
carpenter
pointed
to
a
headless
corpse
at
the
death
of
king
ferdinand
that
head
preserved
in
spirits
of
wine
was
found
in
a
secret
cupboard
in
his
bedroom
a
week
after
the
execution
of
pizzo
everyone
had
received
his
reward
trenta
capelli
was
made
a
colonel
general
nunziante
a
marquis
and
luidgi
died
from
the
effects
of
poison
