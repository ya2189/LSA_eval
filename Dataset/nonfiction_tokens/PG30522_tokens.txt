the

introductory
remarks
the
word
has
an
sound
about
it
and
carries
the
mind
back
to
the
statelier
manners
of
bygone
days
nowadays
we
have
no
leisure
for
courtly
greetings
and
compliments
we
are
slackening
many
of
the
old
bonds
breaking
down
some
of
the
old
restraint
and
though
it
will
seem
treason
to
members
of
a
past
generation
to
say
it
we
are
let
us
hope
arriving
at
a
less
artificial
state
of
things
during
the
march
of
civilisation
marriage
and
the
circumstances
that
lead
up
to
it
have
undergone
many
and
wonderful
changes
though
the
fundamental
idea
of
having
a
mate
has
remained
unaltered
in
essence
just
as
the
savage
of
steals
or
fights
for
his
dusky
bride
so
did
our
own
rude
forefathers
of
past
ages
look
to
rapine
and
the
sword
as
the
natural
means
of
procuring
the
mate
who
was
to
minister
to
their
joys
and
necessities
as
the
chinese
girl
of
the
twentieth
century
is
bought
by
her
husband
like
a
piece
of
furniture
or
a
cooking
utensil
so
the
child
bride
of
ancient
rome
used
to
take
a
formal
farewell
of
her
dolls
and
playthings
making
a
solemn
offering
of
them
to
the
gods
before
she
was
sold
to
the
husband
who
was
legally
entitled
to
beat
her
if
he
liked
she
being
nothing
but
his
slave
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
we
have
travelled
far
since
then
and
it
would
be
impossible
even
to
touch
upon
the
main
points
of
development
that
have
placed
engagement
and
marriage
upon
their
present
footing
amongst
us
it
is
to
be
noted
that
no
two
countries
have
moved
quite
side
by
side
in
this
matter
we
find
the
written
and
unwritten
laws
which
regulate
the
conduct
of
man
to
woman
different
to
some
extent
in
every
land
and
what
would
be
an
act
of
courtesy
in
one
country
would
be
regarded
as
a
serious
breach
of
etiquette
in
another
no
one
has
made
a
clean
sweep
of
all
the
old
formalities
there
are
still
certain
things
which
may
and
may
not
be
done
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
a
few
hints
on
this
ever
new
subject
of
courtship
and
marriage
may
be
found
helpful
to
those
who
are
contemplating
the
most
important
step
in
the
life
of
man
or
woman
we
are
very
free
and
easy
now
in
england
though
not
quite
as
unconventional
as
they
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
we
have
abolished
a
great
many
of
the
false
barriers
erected
by
grundy
or
her
predecessors
which
kept
young
men
and
women
from
enjoying
each
other
society
in
an
innocent
natural
way
of
course
there
is
no
gain
without
a
certain
amount
of
loss
and
while
we
have
advanced
in
freedom
we
have
retrograded
in
chivalry
deference
and
courtesy
the
girl
who
daily
meets
a
man
on
common
ground
in
his
business
or
his
sport
is
not
regarded
by
him
with
the
same
distant
reverence
which
the
devout
lover
of
former
days
cherished
for
the
lady
of
his
heart
perhaps
as
we
are
but
human
beings
it
is
as
well
that
we
are
more
natural
and
less
given
to
idealise
our
beloved
women
are
no
longer
brought
up
in
the
belief
that
it
is
a
disgrace
not
to
get
married
and
a
still
greater
disgrace
to
show
the
least
sign
of
being
anxious
to
fulfil
their
destiny
every
woman
who
is
honest
with
herself
must
confess
to
her
own
heart
even
if
to
no
other
that
marriage
rightly
understood
is
the
life
for
which
she
was
intended
and
the
one
in
which
she
would
find
the
highest
purest
happiness
if
however
the
right
man
fails
to
appear
she
can
make
herself
very
happy
she
does
not
think
that
each
man
of
her
acquaintance
is
desirous
to
marry
her
or
that
a
ten
minutes
will
expose
her
to
the
risk
of
a
proposal
as
things
go
now
men
and
women
in
england
have
abundant
opportunities
for
seeing
and
knowing
each
other
before
linking
their
lives
together
this
freedom
of
intercourse
however
is
fettered
here
and
there
by
what
we
call
etiquette
which
varies
considerably
in
the
different
scales
of
social
life
the
coster
may
have
less
ceremony
in
his
wooing
and
wedding
than
the
nobleman
the
royal
prince
is
hedged
in
by
formalities
unknown
to
the
middle
classes
but
in
every
rank
there
are
accepted
traditions
written
and
unwritten
rules
to
which
men
and
women
must
submit
if
they
will
be
citizens

or
may

it
may
coincide
with
the
birth
of
the
tender
passion
it
may
possibly
be
well
in

of
cupid

or
sad
to
say
it
may
be
little
more
than

men
and
women
meet
each
other
on
very
varied
planes
and

walk

life

its
own
opportunities
the
intellectually
minded
may
begin
their
courtship
over
musty
books
or
choice
editions
and
advanced
students
will
make
love
as
ardently
as
a
country
maid
and
her
rustic
lover
a
dry
mathematical
problem
may
be
as
good
a
medium
for
the
lover
as
a
nosegay
or
a
verse
of
poetry
a
love
of
the
arts
implies
an
emotional
element
that
lends
itself

easily

interpreter

love

the
heart

comradeship
the
fascinations
of
art
are
more
sensuous
than
the
vigorous
breezy
pleasures
of
outdoor
pursuits
for
this
comradeship
yields
golden
opportunities
the
outdoor
pair
may
not
look
so
sentimental
as
the
artistic
couple
but
their
hearts
may
be
as
tender
and
their
love
as
true
though
their
hands
meet
over
the
mending
of
a
tyre
or
the
finding
of
a
tennis
ball
instead
of
being
clasped
in
the
ecstasy
born
of
sweet
sounds
amateur
acting
i
know
of
an
amateur
dramatic
society
that
has
been
nicknamed
the
matrimonial
club
from
the
number
of
marriages
that
have
taken
place
among
the
members
this
amusement
does
pave
the
way
for
courtship
for
in
no
other
are
the
conventionalities
so
completely
set
aside
for
the
time
being
those
who
have
thus
been
brought
together
in
are
not
always
anxious
to
resume
formal
relations
acting
affords
priceless
opportunities
making
up
his
mind
now
when
a
man
has
made
up
his
mind
that
he
wants
to
marry
a
certain
girl
he
emerges
from
the
indefinite
stage
of
observation
admiration
or
flirtation
and
begins
to
make
his
intentions
known
in
view
of
the
impossibility
of
a
universal
law
of
etiquette
it
may
be
said
that
the
remarks
in
these
pages
apply
to
that
largest
section
of
society
known
as
the
middle
classes
when
a
man
is
in
a
position
to
marry
he
should
be
especially
careful
not
to
single
out
a
girl
by
his
attentions
if
he
does
not
intend
to
propose
to
her
for
the
way
in
which
his
conduct
is
regarded
will
be
greatly
influenced
by
his
banking
account
and
one
with
a
small
income
and
smaller
prospects
may
do
things
with
impunity
that
a
man
in
more
affluent
circumstances
could
not
do
without
the
risk
of
having
a
serious
construction
put
upon
them
ineligibles
i
once
heard
a
very
rich
young
man
bewail
his
fate
on
this
score
he
said
a
fellow
with
only
a
hundred
a
year
gets
all
the
fun
he
can
talk
to
any
nice
girl
he
likes
as
much
as
he
likes
and
nothing
is
said
because
people
know
he
ca
marry
but
if
you
have
a
little
money
ran
into
thousands
they
say
you
engaged
the
second
time
you
seen
with
a
lady
this
may
sound
mercenary
but
after
all
it
is
only
practical
when
it
is
known
that
a
man
neither
is
nor
is
likely
to
be
in
a
position
to
marry
parents
encourage
his
visits
to
the
house
or
permit
his
attentions
to
their
daughters
at
their
own
risk
not
that
lack
of
means
will
prevent
falling
in
love
far
from
it
when
parents
think
marriage
impossible
they
sometimes
give
opportunities
to
an
and
then
are
aggrieved
at
his
making
good
use
of
them
there
are
many
things
to
be
considered
at
the
beginning
of
courtship
much
must
depend
upon
the
family
of
the
lady
social
intercourse
in
a
household
where
there
is
neither
father
nor
brother
on
the
scene
a
man
must
walk
warily
he
is
sure
to
be
chaffed
about
any
special
intimacy
with
such
a
family
and
even
chaff
sometimes
spoils
a
situation
a
woman
who
has
no
son
and
has
lost
or
is
temporarily
separated
from
her
husband
will
do
well
to
avoid
any
undue
eagerness
in
cultivating
masculine
society
she
should
exercise
her
own
intuition
and
extend
a
cordial
unaffected
welcome
to
such
men
as
she
thinks
suitable
friends
or
possible
husbands
for
her
daughters
she
should
be
equally
careful
to
eschew
any
sign
of
intrigue
or
suspicion
if
she
is
the
right
sort
of
mother
the
men
will
probably
find
in
her
a
charming
companion
and
valuable
friend
it
is
most
essential
that
girls
who
have
been
mainly
brought
up
under
feminine
influences
should
have
ample
and
varied
opportunities
of
learning
something
about
the
other
sex
by
personal
intercourse
before
there
is
any
question
of
their
marriage
if
this
is
not
done
it
will
be
found
that
they
generally
fall
a
prey
to
the
first
suitor
who
comes
along
they
have
formed
unreal
impossible
and
often
foolish
ideas
about
men
and
are
unable
to
distinguish
the
tares
from
the
wheat
a
girl
with
brothers
or
men
friends
is
far
more
likely
to
make
a
wise
choice
than
one
who
has
formed
her
ideas
from
heroes
of
fiction
where
a
man
is
introduced
by
the
son
of
the
house
his
path
is
on
smoother
ground
as
charlie
chum
he
has
a
perfectly
reasonable
and
innocent
excuse
for
his
frequent
visits
even
though
charlie
may
receive
a
minimum
of
his
attention
on
the
other
hand
fathers
and
brothers
are
not
always
aids
to
courtship
they
hold
different
views
about
the
man
to
those
of
their
womenkind
and
make
things
unpleasant
for
all
parties
a
man
can
soon
establish
himself
as
a
sort
of
oracle
in
a
feminine
circle
and
has
countless
chances
of
making
himself
useful
to
the
ladies
he
may
have
to
consider
the
proprieties
a
little
more
but
then
he
is
master
of
the
situation
with
none
of
his
own
kind
to
point
out
the
weak
joints
in
his
armour
tact
a
tactful
suitor
will
be
courteous
to
every
member
of
his
family
he
will
not
for
a
moment
let
it
be
thought
that
he
considers
her
the
only
one
worthy
of
his
notice
even
younger
brothers
and
sisters
are
preferable
as
allies
and
it
will
make
the
whole
position
much
pleasanter
if
he
is
liked
by
her
own
people
he
will
especially
make
it
his
business
to
stand
well
with
her
parents
by
prettily
filial
attentions
to
mollie
mother
his
cause
will
be
materially
strengthened
and
though
the
young
lady
may
grudge
the
time
he
spends
in
discussing
politics
or
stocks
and
shares
with
her
father
her
own
common
sense
will
tell
her
that
it
is
a
very
good
investment
for
the
future
moreover
a
really
girl
would
never
tolerate
a
man
who
was
discourteous
to
her
parents
however
flattering
his
attitude
might
be
to
herself
a
breach
of
etiquette
when
a
girl
is
staying
with
friends
no
man
should
pay
his
addresses
to
her
unknown
to
her
hostess
or
against
that
lady
wishes
it
is
better
to
end
a
visit
than
to
abuse
hospitality
the
hostess
is
responsible
to
her
visitor
parents
for
the
time
being
and
the
lovers
should
consider
her
position
whatever
social
or
domestic
restrictions
may
stand
between
a
man
and
the
woman
he
wishes
to
woo
he
must
pay
a
certain
regard
to
them
for
her
sake
if
not
for
his
own
no
two
households
are
regulated
by
the
same
code
in
the
smaller
details
of
etiquette
in
one
family
notions
of
decorum
prevail
and
the
lover
will
want
and
prudence
in
another
the
law
of
liberty
reigns
supreme
and
the
young
people
do
pretty
much
as
they
like
in
such
a
circle
the
lover
presence
will
be
taken
for
granted
one
more
or
less
does
not
matter
and
courtship
is
made
easy
man
being
by
nature
a
hunter
who
values
his
spoils
in
proportion
to
the
dangers
and
difficulties
overcome
in
the
chase
is
not
always
so
keen
to
secure
the
quarry
that
costs
the
least
effort
so
the
free
and
easy
parents
often
find
that
their
daughters
remain
unmarried

at
first
sight
how
to
follow
up
an
acquaintance
kindly
offices
of
relations
and
introductions
there
are
definite
laws
of
etiquette
in
the
matter
of
introductions
a
man
has
seen
the
lady
once
or
it
may
be
has
watched
her
from
a
distance
with
longing
eyes
for
months
past
he
may
not
make
himself
known
to
her
without
the
aid
of
a
third
person
who
should
first
ascertain
whether
his
acquaintance
will
be
agreeable
to
the
object
of
his
admiration
it
may
happen
that
the
gods
will
send
him
some
lucky
chance
of
rendering
her
a
timely
service
he
might
rescue
her
dog
from
a
canine
street
fray
pick
up
a
trinket
she
had
dropped
or
better
still
like
the
people
in
novels
travel
with
her
on
a
long
journey
and
prove
himself
a
tactful
cavalier
under
any
of
these
circumstances
the
ice
would
be
broken
and
possibly
an
informal
introduction
would
take
place
it
ought
however
to
be
supplemented
by
more
regular
proceedings
before
any
recognised
intercourse
is
possible
a
girl
is
not
supposed
to
ask
for
an
introduction
to
a
man
but
low
be
it
spoken
she
often
does
not
publicly
of
course
but
she
simply
confides
in
her
married
lady
friend
or
favourite
brother
neither
of
whom
would
naturally
give
her
away
a
man
ought
not
to
haunt
a
girl
whose
acquaintance
he
wishes
to
make
there
is
a
wide
margin
between
accepting
invitations
to
houses
or
turning
up
opportunely
at
parties
where
he
may
expect
to
meet
her
and
walking
obtrusively
past
her
house
several
times
a
day
or
shadowing
her
out
shopping
and
at
public
places
of
amusement
a
very
young
girl
might
think
this
romantic
though
youth
is
terribly
nowadays
her
elders
would
certainly
consider
it
rude
and
put
him
down
as
a
man
to
be
avoided
an
elderly
sentimental
spinster
would
be
in
a
flutter
a
girl
would
think
him
a
bore
if
not
a
bit
of
a
fool
love
at
first
sight
this
seems
a
very
large
order
for
love
means
so
much
that
there
is
often
a
wondrous
of
a
sort
of
flash
from
soul
to
soul
kindling
the
desire
for
closer
union
is
undeniable
a
man
suddenly
sees
the
one
whom
he
resolves
to
win
for
his
wife
a
woman
realises
that
she
has
found
the
man
of
all
others
to
whom
she
would
gladly
give
herself
this
is
not
love
it
is
but
the
herald
that
goes
before
the
king
opinions
on
the
subject
of
marrying
one
first
love
are
much
divided
and
one
has
rather
to
beg
the
question
by
saying
that
it
is
mainly
a
matter
of
temperament
the
age
at
which
you
begin
falling
in
love
has
also
to
be
taken
into
account
a
modern
writer
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
a
wise
man
will
never
marry
his
first
love
for
he
knows
that
matrimony
demands
as
much
special
attention
as
any
of
the
learned
professions
unqualified
amateurs
swell
the
lists
of
the
divorce
court
the
man
case
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
the
man
who
has
some
experience
of
women
and
their
ways
makes
a
better
lover
than
one
who
knows
nothing
of
them
love
may
supply
him
with
essentials
but
only
practice
can
perfect
details
a
man
of
may
be
supposed
to
know
his
own
mind
the
girl
case
the
girl
in
her
teens
who
gives
her
love
and
herself
may
find
full
satisfaction
in
her
marriage
but
blind
and
impulsive
inexperience
may
lay
up
a
store
of
sorrow
for
the
future
no
man
is
wise
to
hurry
a
young
girl
into
marriage
how
to
follow
up
an
acquaintance
once
the
introduction
is
over
it
remains
mainly
with
the
man
to
make
the
most
of
his
advantages
he
obtains
permission
to
call
and
it
is
not
a
bad
plan
to
allow
a
short
interval
to
elapse
before
availing
himself
of
the
privilege
he
must
not
seem
neglectful
but
may
wait
just
long
enough
to
give
the
lady
time
to
think
about
him
to
wonder
to
wish
to
long
for
his
coming
he
will
be
careful
not
to
transgress
any
detail
of
etiquette
in
this
his
first
call
but
he
will
not
leave
without
having
made
some
distinct
advance
having
found
some
pretext
for
a
less
formal
visit
he
will
convey
to
her
in
a
subtle
meaning
manner
that
the
sun
will
not
shine
for
him
till
he
sees
her
again
her
family
he
will
find
out
what
interests
her
people
he
will
bring
her
father
rare
cuttings
for
his
garden
or
introduce
him
to
a
choice
brand
of
cigars
he
will
lend
her
mother
books
sing
or
recite
at
her
pet
charity
entertainments
or
even
make
a
martyr
of
himself
at
and
bazaars
he
will
bring
designs
for
her
or
teach
small
tommy
to
ride
a
bicycle
as
to
the
lady
of
his
heart
he
will
begin
by
sharing
her
pursuits
only
as
a
means
to
an
end
for
when
once
steps
in
other
pursuits
are
neglected
if
not
totally
shelved
for
the
time
being
this
transition
stage
requires
great
tact
he
must
not
startle
her
by
too
sudden
a
development
some
women
may
like
to
be
taken
by
storm
to
be
married
by
capture
as
it
were
but
the
average
girl
likes
to
have
time
to
enjoy
being
wooed
and
won
she
basks
in
the
gradual
unfolding
of
his
love
she
rejoices
over
each
new
phase
of
their
courtship
she
lingers
longingly
on
the
threshold
of
her
great
happiness
she
is
intoxicated
by
the
sense
of
her
own
power
she
is
touched
by
the
deference
which
curbs
his
ardour
kindly
offices
of
relations
and
friends
outsiders
can
often
make
or
mar
a
possible
marriage
when
the
third
person
undertakes
to
introduce
two
people
in
a
case
where
even
a
attraction
is
supposed
to
exist
no
remark
should
be
made
about
it
the
lady
friend
who
tells
a
girl
that
a
man
is
very
much
taken
with
her
strikes
a
fatal
blow
at
the
unconscious
grace
with
which
the
girl
would
otherwise
have
received
him
the
blundering
brother
who
blurts
out
my
sister
says
that
girl
awfully
gone
on
you
old
chap
probably
makes
his
chum
fight
shy
of
the
girl
or
indulge
in
a
little
fun
at
her
expense
it
should
be
remembered
that
a
nearer
acquaintance
does
not
always
confirm
impressions
formed
at
a
distance
a
sister
who
will
discreetly
play
the
part
of
number
three
is
invaluable
a
brother
who
will
bring
the
man
home
to
dinner
or
arrange
cycling
expeditions
is
a
treasure
the
aunt
who
gives
dances
or
river
parties
just
when
he
has
his
holiday
is
inestimable
the
uncle
who
has
a
fancy
for
stage
managing
and
casts
the
two
for
the
lovers
parts
in
a
charmingly
unconscious
fashion
is
a
relation
worth
having
married
friends
on
either
side
can
afford
many
extra
and
delightful
opportunities
of
meeting
while
thus
smoothing
the
path
of
love
all
obtrusive
allusion
to
the
suspected
or
recognised
state
of
things
should
be
carefully
avoided
it
is
an
unpardonable
breach
of
etiquette
for
any
one
to
draw
attention
to
the
movements
of
a
couple
by
a
laugh
a
nod
or
a
wink
which
though
not
intended
to
reach
them
gives
frequent
rise
to
unpleasant
situations
her
friends
should
guard
against
anything
savouring
of
a
his
friends
should
avoid
any
indication
that
they
look
upon
her
as
his
lawful
prey
there
should
be
no
questionable
chaff
or
talking
at
the
possible
lovers
older
people
who
have
forgotten
how
tender
their
own
sensibilities
once
were
are
rather
fond
of
cracking
jokes
and
make
tactless
pointed
remarks
the
old
friend
of
the
family
who
slaps
the
prospective
suitor
on
the
back
and
in
the
lady
presence
challenges
him
to
kiss
her
under
the
mistletoe
only
succeeds
in
making
them
both
uncomfortable
the
elderly
relative
who
nods
her
cap
saying
oh
yes
we
know
all
about
it
we
were

the

george
eliot
describes
two
of
her
characters
as
being
in
that
stage
of
courtship
which
makes
the
most
exquisite
moment
of
youth
the
freshest
of
passion
when
each
is
sure
of
the
other
love
and
all
its
mutual
divination
exalting
the
most
trivial
word
the
slightest
gesture
into
thrills
delicate
and
delicious
as
wafted
jasmine
scent
it
may
be
that
he
has
some
honourable
reason
to
forbid
his
speaking
when
he
would
he
may
fear
to
lose
her
altogether
if
he
is
too
hasty
possibly
there
is
another
man
in
the
case
she
may
be
revelling
in
the
new
joy
of
life
without
analysing
its
source
if
she
has
faced
the
secret
of
her
own
heart
she
will
mount
guard
over
herself
lest
word
or
look
should
betray
her
before
he
has
told
her
that
she
does
not
love
in
vain
breaches
of
etiquette
when
a
man
finds
that
his
attentions
are
unwelcome
and
a
woman
has
used
every
means
in
her
power
short
of
actual
rudeness
to
show
him
that
she
does
not
desire
his
nearer
acquaintance
he
has
no
right
to
force
himself
or
his
love
upon
her
he
has
no
right
to
make
sure
of
any
woman
love
before
he
has
asked
her
for
it
unless
of
course
she
has
betrayed
herself
by
an
unwomanly
want
of
reticence
it
is
both
foolish
and
for
him
to
play
the
part
of
and
to
object
to
her
receiving
attentions
from
any
one
else
until
he
has
declared
himself
he
can
assume
no
control
over
the
disposal
of
her
favours
still
less
should
he
stoop
to
put
a
spoke
in
another
wheel
the
question
of
presents
a
line
must
be
carefully
drawn
between
the
gifts
of
an
unconfessed
lover
and
of
a
the
former
may
send
flowers
and
pretty
trifles
of
that
sort
or
he
could
give
her
a
dog
or
a
persian
kitten
but
he
must
not
offer
her
articles
of
jewellery
or
any
item
of
her
toilette
he
might
give
her
the
undressed
skin
of
an
animal
that
he
had
shot
but
he
could
not
order
a
set
of
furs
to
be
sent
to
her
from
a
shop
it
must
be
remembered
that
ostensibly
they
are
as
yet
only
friends
and
though
every
gift
will
have
its
inward
meaning
it
should
not
have
any
outward
significance

exchange
of
hospitality
where
both
families
are
acquainted
and
in
a
similar
social
position
the
interchange
of
hospitality
will
probably
be
somewhat
increased
in
virtue
of
the
growing
intimacy
between
the
possible
lovers
until
there
is
an
acknowledged
engagement
it
would
not
be
etiquette
for
his
family
to
single
her
out
from
the
rest
of
her
own
people
by
inviting
her
alone
a
parent
brother
or
sister
ought
to
be
included
it
would
also
be
diplomatic
on
the
part
of
her
friends
not
to
extend
too
gushing
a
welcome
to
him
while
they
take
his
belongings
as
a
matter
of
course
because
the
one
family
can
give
dinner
parties
it
does
not
follow
that
the
other
should
not
afford
just
as
much
enjoyment
by
a
simpler
form
of
hospitality
the
possible
lover
does
not
come
to
criticise
the
cuisine
of
the
household
in
which
the
object
of
his
desires
is
to
be
seen
the
man
who
lives
at
home
it
will
often
happen
that
a
man
makes
acquaintances
who
become
friends
quite
independently
of
his
own
family
but
if
he
is
seriously
contemplating
matrimony
he
will
be
anxious
to
introduce
his
chosen
one
to
his
womenkind
supposing
that
his
people
were
the
older
residents
in
the
place
he
would
pave
the
way
by
saying
that
his
mother
or
sister
as
the
case
might
be
would
so
much
like
to
call
and
might
she
do
so
unless
there
should
be
some
purely
feminine
feud
the
permission
would
be
cordially
given
if
on
the
other
hand
the
family
were
the
first
comers
to
the
locality
he
would
then
ask
the
lady
to
call
on
his
people
intimating
that
they
were
longing
to
know
her
and
her
daughter
and
what
a
personal
gratification
it
would
be
to
him
to
bring
the
desired
meeting
about
in
the
present
day
the
old
hard
and
fast
rules
which
used
to
regulate
calling
are
no
longer
observed
if
acquaintance
is
really
sought
there
will
be
no
difficulty
for
a
woman
of
tact
and
judgment
to
cultivate
it
a
danger
women
are
very
quick
to
see
when
they
are
being
courted
for
their
sons
or
brothers
and
they
do
not
always
like
it
it
is
discourteous
and
very
transparent
to
send
an
invitation
to
a
girl
the
day
after
her
brother
has
come
home
on
leave
in
which
you
hope
that
captain
boyle
will
be
able
to
accompany
her
when
practically
you
have
ignored
her
existence
since
the
last
time
he
was
at
home
it
is
not
kind
or
considerate
to
try
and
monopolise
the
society
of
any
man
whose
business
or
profession
only
permits
of
his
being
at
home
at
long
intervals
a
girl
may
want
to
have
him
with
her
very
much
indeed
but
she
should
not
be
piqued
and
feel
injured
if
he
excuses
himself
on
the
ground
of
having
to
take
his
sister
out
or
spend
his
evening
with
his
parents
he
will
be
all
the
better
husband
for
this
courtesy
to
his
own
relations
of
course
his
people
may
be
very
dull
possibly
unpleasant
and
in
that
case
real
friendship
will
be
a
labour
if
not
an
impossibility
but
for
the
man
sake
they
must
be
treated
in
such
a
way
as
not
to
hurt
either
his
feelings
or
their
own
the
same
naturally
holds
good
with
regard
to
her
belongings
the
man
who
lives
in
rooms
is
a
much
easier
person
to
cultivate
you
take
it
for
granted
that
he
is
dull
that
his
dinners
are
not
well
cooked
and
that
he
misses
the
delights
of
home
so
you
ask
him
to
drop
in
when
he
likes
we
are
nearly
always
in
to
tea
or
we
dine
at
and
if
you
take
us
as
we
are
there
will
be
a
place
for
you
as
soon
as
a
man
sees
that
this
sort
of
invitation
is
really
meant
he
will
not
be
slow
to
avail
himself
of
it
not
that
he
will
come
to
dinner
every
other
night
but
he
will
drop
in
to
tea
and
turn
up
in
the
course
of
the
evening
for
a
little
music
and
a
chat
he
gets
into
the
habit
of
coming
in
on
sunday
afternoons
and
generally
ends
by
staying
to
supper
as
a
host
all
this
means
a
great
deal
to
a
lone
bachelor
and
makes
him
long
for
a
home
of
his
own
in
return
for
this
delightful
hospitality
he
will
perhaps
ask
a
sister
to
stay
with
him
and
give
a
in
his
rooms
later
on
he
will
have
seats
for
a
theatre
and
arrange
a
nice
little
dinner
or
supper
in
town
where
dramatic
delights
are
out
of
reach
he
will
plan
a
river
or
cycling
expedition
he
will
entertain
his
friends
at
a
local
cricket
match
he
will
inspire
his
fellow
bachelors
to
give
a
dance
and
there
will
be
only
one
guest
whose
presence
is
of
any
importance
to
him
he
will
not
let
it
appear
that
he
is
paying
a
debt
he
will
imply
rather
that
the
ladies
are
conferring
a
favour
upon
him
he
will
consult
her
mother
as
to
many
arrangements
and
make
sure
that
all
the
guests
are
to
her
liking
he
will
not
be
afraid
of
asking
a
possible
rival
who
might
be
more
dangerous
when
absent
than
present
while
thus
entertaining
the
lady
of
his
choice
the
suitor
must
discern
nicely
between
paying
her
special
honour
and
taking
it
for
granted
that
she
already
belongs
to
him
he
must
not
advertise
the
fact
that
the
party
is
given
for
her
by
neglecting
his
other
guests
or
by
omitting
pleasant
courtesies
to
maidens
chapter
iv
with
the
home
girl
the
bachelor
girl
the
business
girl
the
student
or
professional
girl
friends
who
become
the
home
girl
as
has
already
been
said
the
lover
will
do
well
to
study
the
workings
of
his
lady
home
if
she
has
many
domestic
duties
to
perform
he
will
arrange
his
spare
time
to
fit
in
with
hers
he
will
not
call
at
such
times
as
would
be
inconvenient
and
run
the
risk
of
ructions
simply
because
he
knows
will
be
glad
to
see
him
he
will
not
look
aggrieved
if
she
refuses
to
go
out
cycling
with
him
because
she
has
promised
to
take
the
little
ones
out
blackberrying
he
will
seize
a
golden
chance
and
go
with
them
when
he
is
at
her
home
he
will
not
act
as
if
the
whole
place
belonged
to
him
and
he
will
be
careful
not
to
become
a
bore
men
of
leisure
and
men
whose
professions
place
them
on
confidential
terms
such
as
doctors
and
clergymen
have
the
greatest
opportunities
of
knowing
the
home
girl
at
her
best
and
at
her
worst
the
last
two
see
her
under
conditions
that
show
what
she
is
really
made
of
and
not
merely
what
she
appears
in
society
for
they
have
access
to
the
house
in
times
of
trouble
when
outsiders
are
excluded
the
bachelor
girl
is
pretty
sure
to
be
out
of
her
teens
but
not
necessarily
in
the
thirties
she
will
probably
have
girl
chums
who
like
herself
are
living
in
a
more
or
less
independent
fashion
she
sometimes
indulges
in
theories
and
it
may
prove
most
interesting
to
convert
her
from
the
error
of
her
ways
a
man
has
such
beautifully
sure
ground
under
his
feet
when
she
has
given
him
plainly
to
understand
that
she
prefers
friendship
to
love
a
suitor
will
find
his
opportunities
of
intercourse
regulated
by
her
standard
of
conventionality
she
is
free
to
make
her
own
life
with
her
own
code
of
conduct
her
own
ideas
of
responsibility
she
meets
him
frankly
on
what
she
deems
common
ground
but
he
sees
the
other
side
of
things
for
men
and
women
never
can
and
never
will
look
at
life
from
the
same
point
of
view
his
knowledge
should
make
him
all
the
more
jealous
of
her
fair
fame
but
he
must
walk
warily
lest
he
wound
her
womanly
dignity
she
will
do
nothing
wrong
her
heart
is
too
pure
for
that
but
he
must
not
let
her
do
what
may
even
appear
to
be
wrong
at
first
she
will
be
a
little
intoxicated
with
the
sense
of
her
own
freedom
he
must
never
take
advantage
of
that
for
he
knows
that
the
woman
always
pays
they
will
probably
include
one
of
her
chums
in
their
cosy
at
her
rooms
and
there
will
be
no
secret
of
his
coming
and
going
he
will
see
her
home
from
the
theatre
concert
or
lecture
but
he
will
not
go
and
smoke
in
her
flat
till
the
small
hours
he
will
discriminate
as
to
the
restaurant
where
they
have
lunch
together
and
he
will
not
invite
her
to
a
supper
after
the
play
she
will
entertain
him
at
her
club
and
he
will
guard
against
the
assumption
of
rights
that
are
not
his
the
business
girl
the
daily
life
of
the
business
girl
is
of
necessity
a
regular
one
and
the
man
who
wants
to
know
more
of
her
knows
where
to
find
her
if
by
chance
he
is
employed
in
the
same
firm
he
has
daily
chances
of
making
headway
with
her
he
can
often
render
her
little
services
help
her
over
rough
places
and
make
life
as
pleasant
again
for
her
all
this
can
be
so
managed
that
no
one
save
perhaps
a
rival
will
know
anything
about
it
he
will
certainly
not
make
her
the
talk
of
the
office
by
bragging
of
his
conquest
and
laying
wagers
as
to
his
chance
of
success
or
get
her
into
hot
water
by
hindering
her
at
her
work
she
will
keep
her
own
counsel
and
not
giggle
with
other
girls
when
he
comes
along
of
course
she
will
tell
her
special
friend
all
about
it
for
what
is
the
good
of
a
if
you
can
not
talk
to
some
one
on
the
subject
she
will
not
display
the
buttonhole
he
bought
her
on
the
way
from
the
train
to
all
the
other
girls
as
his
gift
nor
will
she
be
foolish
and
give
herself
away
by
hanging
about
his
room
door
in
the
hopes
of
seeing
him
she
will
always
find
time
for
a
word
or
a
bright
glance
when
they
do
meet
by
accident
of
course
he
will
not
make
her
conspicuous
by
always
travelling
home
with
her
but
he
will
be
at
hand
to
pilot
her
through
a
fog
to
help
her
out
of
a
crowd
or
to
get
her
a
place
when
there
is
anything
to
be
seen
he
will
make
it
plain
that
he
thinks
of
her
and
is
ever
on
the
alert
to
play
the
part
of
her
cavalier
she
is
practical
and
as
a
rule
but
she
does
not
object
to
be
courted
when
they
plan
a
saturday
outing
she
will
not
propose
what
she
knows
to
be
beyond
his
means
but
she
will
pardon
him
for
a
little
extravagance
in
her
honour
social
inequality
when
a
man
in
a
superior
position
begins
paying
attentions
to
a
girl
filling
a
subordinate
post
he
will
probably
expose
her
to
the
jealousy
and
possible
malice
of
her
fellows
but
this
will
depend
greatly
upon
the
girl
herself
in
this
case
the
suitor
must
steer
clear
of
anything
like
patronage
if
she
is
worthy
of
his
notice
she
is
worthy
of
his
respect
and
consideration
he
will
be
careful
not
to
take
her
to
any
place
of
amusement
where
she
would
feel
out
of
her
element
or
run
the
risk
of
being
snubbed
by
any
of
his
own
rich
friends
the
son
of
a
wealthy
merchant
would
not
give
as
much
pleasure
to
a
girl
earning
thirty
shillings
in
his
father
office
if
he
took
her
to
supper
at
the
carlton
as
if
he
selected
some
less
magnificent
restaurant
she
would
feel
more
at
home
on
the
river
or
at
court
than
on
the
lawn
at
hurlingham
he
would
show
her
that
his
pleasure
was
to
be
with
her
and
he
would
wait
till
he
could
call
her
his
wife
before
introducing
her
to
a
new
world
the
student
or
professional
girl
there
is
a
little
country
called
bohemia
whose
laws
rule
the
kingdom
of
art
and
whose
government
seems
a
trifle
erratic
to
those
who
live
outside
the
charmed
circle
students
of
music
painting
sculpture
and
the
drama
have
a
code
of
etiquette
that
may
be
called
adaptable
but
it
does
not
follow
that
because
a
man
is
an
artist
he
must
therefore
be
deficient
in
courtesy
to
women
nor
is
it
yet
inevitable
that
when
a
girl
develops
a
talent
for
drawing
she
should
violate
all
the
proprieties
falling
in
love
with
is
a
very
old
story
but
it
is
not
quite
a
thing
of
the
past
a
man
has
no
right
to
work
on
the
emotions
of
his
pupil
merely
for
his
own
amusement
or
to
gratify
his
vanity
he
may
find
that
it
infuses
more
soul
into
her
music
but
she
is
a
woman
as
well
as
an
artist
where
both
have
the
artistic
temperament
highly
developed
it
is
playing
with
fire
indeed
dramatic
is
thrown
into
very
mixed
society
she
is
left
with
a
great
deal
of
spare
time
on
her
hands
when
merely
understudying
or
out
of
an
engagement
she
is
forced
to
keep
late
hours
and
may
be
exposed
to
many
unpleasant
experiences
i
know
of
one
man
who
was
so
distressed
at
the
girl
of
his
heart
having
to
cross
london
by
the
last
every
night
that
he
changed
his
quarters
and
took
rooms
as
near
to
where
she
was
living
as
he
could
in
order
to
be
able
to
see
her
home
without
making
the
fact
unduly
conspicuous
this
was
a
delicate
act
of
courtesy
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
they
are
now
happily
married
medical
student
and
hospital
are
generally
women
with
a
special
turn
of
mind
and
in
the
former
case
the
work
of
training
is
so
absorbing
that
it
can
hardly
be
run
concurrently
with
the
delights
of
courtship
the
nurse
soon
learns
to
take
care
of
herself
and
has
many
special
opportunities
of
studying
the
lords
of
creation
she
sees
some
of
the
noblest
and
most
gifted
of
them
at
their
work
the
wildest
of
them
at
play
and
all
and
sundry
in
their
hour
of
weakness
and
this
experience
should
be
borne
in
mind
by
the
man
who
seeks
to
win
her
she
will
not
regard
him
as
a
nor
as
a
hero
of
romance
she
will
not
appeal
to
the
man
who
wants
a
mere
plaything
in
his
wife
she
will
have
far
higher
gifts
than
the
society
doll
but
she
will
be
a
woman
to
be
wooed
and
worth
the
winning
friends
who
become
lovers
there
are
those
who
say
that
friendship
excludes
love
and
there
is
a
kind
of
friendship
which
can
only
exist
where
love
is
impossible
and
undesired
on
the
other
hand
we
know
that
sometimes
the
boy
and
girl
who
have
grown
up
side
by
side
who
have
shared
each
other
pranks
and
penalties
do
wake
up
one
day
to
find
a
new
element
asserting
itself
in
their
intercourse
a
certain
shyness
springs
up
between
them
only
to
be
dispelled
by
fuller
sweeter
comradeship
this
development
sometimes
takes
place
during
a
period
of
separation
or
when
a
possible
rival
appears
on
the
scene
it
usually
assumes
concrete
form
in
the
man
mind
first
he
may
hide
his
love
under
the
guise
of
friendship
till
he
feels
he
has
a
right
to
make
it
known
it
may
be
that
he
has
to
go
abroad
to
seek
the
wherewithal
to
start
a
home
and
when
he
has
succeeded
he
will
write
some
such
letter
as
this
my
dear
clari
when
i
threw
up
my
berth
at
home
you
wondered
why
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
leave
the
old
country
and
home
and
you
and
it
was
very
hard
not
to
tell
you
the
real
reason
i
came
out
here
to
make
enough
money
to
set
up
housekeeping
and
dear
i
want
you
to
come
and
help
me
now
i
have
succeeded
so
far
i
know
it
is
a
tremendous
thing
to
ask
and
that
i
am
entirely
unworthy
of
the
sacrifice
you
would
be
making
but
dear
we
know
each
other
pretty
well
by
this
and
i
hope
you
can
trust
yourself
to
me
if
you
only
knew
how
i
have
longed
to
tell
you
this
through
the
last
two
years
of
our
sweet
but
to
me
unsatisfying
friendship
you
would
not
keep
me
in
suspense
any
longer
than
you
can
help
you
have
been
the
one
thought
and
object
of
my
life
ever
since
i
came
out
and
i
have
lived
in
fear
of
some
other
fellow
getting
in
before
me
i
think
i
must
always
have
loved
you
it
seems
a
part
of
myself
but
it
was
your
first
ball
that
woke
me
up
let
me
know
soon
ever
and
always
your
devoted
gordon
however
the
change
from
friendship
to
love
comes
about
the
man
must
be
just
as
courteous
as
if
she
had
only
crossed
his
path
in
the
fulness
of
her
young
womanhood
he
must
not
take
her
for
granted
because
he
knew
her
in
pinafores
nor
slight
her
sensibilities
because
he
taught
her
to
climb
trees
if
he
is
negligent
other
men
will
supply
his
deficiencies
as
a
lover
he
is
bound
to
appear
in
a
new
light
and
he
must
look
to
it
that
he
does
not
suffer
by
the
change
the
friend
ought
to
make
the
best
lover
for
he
knows
the
tastes
and
weaknesses
the
temperament
and
surroundings
of
the
woman
he
has
chosen
they
will
be
bound
by
countless
old
associations
but
this
very
familiarity
may
breed
not
contempt
but
a
mental
attitude
that
will
rob
courtship
of
more
than
half
its
charm
chapter
v
male
and
female
he
changes
his
mind
on
the
verge
of
a
proposal
how
she
accepts
the
situation
how
she
may
give
encouragement
or
ward
off
an
unwelcome
it
may
be
questioned
whether
there
is
any
etiquette
in
flirtation
yes
i
think
there
is
flirts
of
both
sexes
may
be
divided
into
two
large
classes
the
wanton
and
deliberate
the
kindly
and
spontaneous
flirts
the
first
class
are
birds
of
prey
the
man
is
probably
very
charming
a
delightful
companion
an
ideal
cavalier
a
man
whose
society
a
woman
always
enjoys
especially
if
she
does
not
take
him
seriously
it
is
she
who
fails
to
realise
that
she
is
only
one
of
a
large
number
who
fall
victims
and
suffer
accordingly
she
blissfully
accepts
his
subtle
suggestion
that
she
is
one
woman
in
the
world
for
him
so
she
is
while
they
are
together
and
flatters
herself
that
though
he
may
have
flirted
with
others
he
is
really
in
love
with
her
when
once
the
sport
of
the
moment
is
over
he
leaves
his
prey
more
or
less
cruelly
wounded
and
gaily
seeks
new
fields
for
his
prowess
this
sort
of
man
likes
young
and
inexperienced
girls
or
women
whose
confiding
trust
exceeds
their
power
of
discernment
it
is
an
unpardonable
breach
of
etiquette
for
a
man
to
abuse
hospitality
and
the
privilege
of
intercourse
by
wanton
conduct
of
this
kind
making
a
girl
conspicuous
a
man
should
remember
that
it
is
the
woman
who
suffers
from
the
breath
of
slander
or
the
pettiness
of
gossip
such
things
affect
him
but
little
if
at
all
suppose
that
two
young
people
belong
to
a
public
tennis
or
dramatic
club
the
man
singles
out
one
particular
girl
by
his
attentions
makes
a
point
of
always
seeing
her
home
establishes
himself
as
her
constant
cavalier
and
thus
puts
it
in
the
power
of
the
gossips
to
say
well
if
they
are
not
engaged
they
ought
to
be
after
a
time
he
cools
off
for
no
other
reason
than
that
he
is
tired
of
the
girl
or
has
possibly
seen
a
fresh
and
more
attractive
face
it
may
have
dawned
upon
him
that
he
might
be
asked
his
intentions
and
he
does
not
care
to
confess
that
he
never
had
any
this
course
of
action
is
especially
unfair
in
the
case
of
a
young
girl
whose
experience
of
men
ways
is
but
beginning
an
older
woman
ought
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
herself
and
if
she
thinks
such
a
game
worth
the
candle
no
one
can
blame
the
man
for
helping
her
to
play
it
the
female
flirt
a
woman
in
the
first
class
of
flirts
is
possibly
more
dangerous
than
the
man
she
has
no
heart
only
insatiable
vanity
she
uses
her
powers
on
all
who
come
in
her
way
regardless
of
any
claim
another
of
her
sex
may
have
upon
them
lover
husband
and
friend
they
are
all
fair
game
for
her
and
if
hearts
are
damaged
well
she
is
always
sure
that
her
own
will
remain
intact
her
veracity
is
as
elastic
as
her
conscience
her
charms
are
equalled
by
her
unscrupulousness
she
will
keep
the
youth
in
bondage
without
the
slightest
intention
of

after

or
more

if
she

on
a

scale
kindly
spontaneous
flirts
the
members
of
the
second
class
men
and
women
are
charming
without
being
dangerous
they
love
the
society
of
the
other
sex
they
have
the
art
of
pleasing
and
make
use
of
it
but
they
play
the
game
fairly
there
is
no
poaching
no
snares
are
laid
for
the
unwary
and
if
harm
is
done
it
is
because
people
have
misunderstood
them
the
man
flirts
because
he
loves
to
say
pretty
things
to
a
woman
he
revels
in
an
interchange
of
banter
and
repartee
which
makes
her
eyes
sparkle
and
his
pulses
beat
the
faster
the
girl
flirts
out
of
the
abundance
of
her
joyous
vitality
she
suits
herself
to
the
companion
of
the
hour
she
knows
nothing
of
the
tender
passion
she
is
not
taking
life
quite
seriously
yet
but
she
has
the
delicacy
to
draw
back
when
she
sees
danger
signals
in
the
eyes
or
the
lingering
clasp
of
her
hand
she
will
not
make
a
fool
of
him
she
is
too
straight
for
that
withdrawing
gracefully
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
change
the
course
of
things
when
one
has
drifted
into
a
flirtation
it
behoves
a
girl
then
to
choose
her
man
carefully
and
not
to
place
herself
in
any
false
position
towards
him
if
he
is
not
chivalrous
enough
to
take
a
delicately
conveyed
hint
he
will
only
imagine
that
she
is
playing
a
more
subtle
game
of
coquetry
and
by
redoubling
his
attentions
make
himself
the
reverse
of
agreeable
no
man
with
any
regard
for
the
most
elementary
rules
of
etiquette
would
either
embarrass
a
lady
by
keeping
up
a
tone
that
she
had
even
indirectly
discouraged
or
insult
her
by
insinuating
that
she
had
led
him
on
he

his
mind
on
the
verge
of
a
proposal
this
is
bound
to
be
an
awkward
development
for
both
parties
and
it
will
take
all
a
man
tact
to
avoid
giving
pain
and
possibly
gaining
credit
for
having
behaved
badly
it
is
nevertheless
the
best
time
for
a
change
to
come
it
may
be
that
he
has
idealised
the
object
of
his
attentions
looked
at
her
through
eyes
blinded
by
her
beauty
or
dazzled
by
her
fascination
he
has
not
stopped
to
think
what
sort
of
woman
she
really
is
what
lies
beneath
that
fair
exterior
then
the
word
is
spoken
the
action
witnessed
the
mood
revealed
which
makes
him
shrink
from
the
thought
of
making
her
his
wife
his
way
of
escape
he
will
either
seek
safety
in
flight
after
a
perfectly
polite
but
farewell
or
he
will
gradually
withdraw
from
the
terms
of
intimacy
upon
which
he
has
stood
in
no
way
must
he
be
discourteous
either
to
the
lady
or
her
friends
slow
awakening
a
man
may
change
his
mind
almost
imperceptibly
he
will
not
turn
against
the
woman
but
he
will
realise
that
she
can
never
be
more
to
him
than
a
friend
a
genial
chum
the
cause
of
this
is
most
likely
the
advent
of
the
right
woman
force
of
contrast
has
a
way
of
sorting
people
out
he
will
tell
his
friend
the
truth
and
she
will
like
him
all
the
better
for
his
confidence
in
her
how
she
accepts
the
situation
a
brave
woman
will
not
like
being
left
any
more
than
her
weaker
sister
but
she
will
take
the
blow
standing
and
be
able
to
rejoice
in
the
happiness
of
others
she
will
face
her
own
sorrow
alone
and
will
utter
no
sound
of
complaint
it
is
an
impertinence
for
acquaintances
to
condole
with
her
the
sympathy
of
her
loved
ones
will
be
hard
enough
to
bear
she
will
be
perfectly
loyal
to
the
woman
her
friend
has
chosen
how
she
may
give
encouragement
there
are
women
who
leave
the
men
very
little
to
do
in
the
way
of
courtship
encouragement

in
a
true
womanly
fashion
she
can
wear
his
flowers
in
preference
to
any
others
and
may
judiciously
let
him
see
that
she
has
kept
the
best
in
water
after
the
dance
she
will
accept
his
escort
and
receive
his
attentions
graciously
so
as
to
show
that
they
are
valued
due
reserve
she
should
never
bestow
effusive
attentions
on
her
lover
nor
boast
of
his
devotion
to
her
she
may
let
him
see
that
he
stands
well
with
her
without
telling
him
that
he
comes
first
it
is
good
for
him
to
see
that
other
men
are
in
the
running
and
she
must
not
let
her
feeling
for
him
lead
her
into
discourtesy
to
any
one
else
she
can
let
him
do
the
wooing
without
being
either
haughty
or
capricious
for
no
man
likes
a
woman
who
openly
runs
after
him
transparent
devices
a
girl
does
not
always
try
to
detach
her
lover
from
the
rest
of
the
company
though
she
enjoys
a
as
much
as
he
does
she
does
not
want
to
be
sent
with
him
on
fictitious
errands
to
the
bottom
of
the
garden
she
leaves
him
to
find
the
opportunities
and
has
a
horror
of
her
matchmaking
relations
how
she
may
ward
off
an
unwelcome
offer
it
is
commonly
agreed
that
a
woman
ought
to
be
able
to
do
this
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
her
own
intuition
is
seldom
at
fault
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
she
may
save
the
situation
by
a
timely
jest
a
kindly
bit
of
inconsequence
a
sudden
humorous
inspiration
not
at
his
expense
of
course
and
the
man
who
is
not
a
fool
will
see
that
it
is
not

psychological
moment
above
all
she
must
avoid

let

keep

at
her
side
pay
attention
to
the
greatest
bore
listen
with
grateful
patience
to
the
most
prosy
person
she
knows
rather
than
leave
the
ground
clear
for
him
she
should
not
go
for
moonlight
strolls
nor
to
look
for
the
southern
cross
on
board
ship
if
she
really
wants
to
stave
off
his
proposal
there
is
no
need
to
be
rude
and
even
if
she
has
to
appear
unsympathetic
that
is
better
than
to
humiliate
him
by
a
rejection
some
women

over
their
hapless
suitors
as

this
is
the
height

may

be

in
the
best
years
of

if

position
and
endow
her

with
the
needful
strength
for
the

how
can
the

of
twenty
be
expected
to
work
for
three
without
getting
weary
before
his
day
has
well
begun

how
can
either

really
know
wherein
true
happiness
lies
most
probably
such
a
pair
will
learn
to
curse
their
folly
before
they
reach
maturity

marriage
should
not

and
driven
off

my
ideal

a

matched
couple
young

love
at
is
a
terribly
intoxicating
draft
says
a
writer
and
the
sight
of
young
lovers
is
one
that
softens
all
but
the
most
cynical
we
smile
at
their
inconsequence
tremble
almost
at
their
rapturous
happiness
yawn
it
may
be
over
their
mutual
ecstasies
still
we
know
they
are
passing
through
a
phase
they
are
lifted
for
the
time
being
out
of
the
commonplace
and
we
make
excuses
but
these
blissful
young
people
are
apt
to
take
too
much
for
granted
because
doris
worships

it
does
not
follow
that
her

are
to
be
inflicted
morning
noon
and
night
with
his
presence
or
his
praises
she
has
no
right
to
imply
that
every
moment
spent
apart
from
him
is
wasted
she
has
no
call
to
give
up
her
share
of
household
duties
or
to
forsake
her
own
studies
just
to
wander
about
restlessly
counting
the
minutes
till
he
shall
come
or
to
spend
the
intervals
between
his
visits
in
dressing
for
his
next
appearance
she
should
not
look
bored
directly
the
conversation
turns
away
from
him
or
exalt
her
idol
over
those
who
have
loved
and
cared
for
her
since
infancy
young
men
who
woo
maturity
there
seems
to
be
a
tendency
nowadays
for
the
surplus
years
to
be
on
the
woman
side
this
is
in
most
cases
a
grievous
mistake
the
girls
are
often
to
blame
for
it
in
the
pride
of
their
youth
they
snub
the
young
admirers
whom
they
do
not
think
worth
their
notice
an
older
woman
knows
how
to
heal
the
wound
thus
inflicted
and
with
her
experience
her
greater
tolerance
and
her
charms
mellowed
but
not
yet
faded
by
age
she
can
win
passionate
devotion
from
one
of
these
singed
butterflies
she
welcomes
him
with
a
dash
of
maternal
tenderness
in
her
manner
she
takes
an
interest
in
his
doings
and
subtly
flatters
his
vanity
while
her
own
heart
is
glad
that
she
still
has
the
power
to
please
drifting
he
soon
feels
quite
at
home
with
her
and
grows
more
venturesome
she
feels
her
youth
renewed
and
they
drift
into
closer
relations
she
salves
her
conscience
with
the
thought
that
she
is
keeping
him
out
of
harm
way
she
makes
no
secret
of
the
disparity
between
them
though
she
may
avoid
the
cold
fact
of
figures
he
fondly
thinks
she
will
never
grow
old
such
a
connection
may
be
the
salvation
of
an
unstable
youth
especially
if
she
does
not
let
him
marry
her
she
may
make
a
man
of
him
a
good
husband
for
a
girl
young
enough
to
be
her
daughter
she
will
not
tell
him
to
go
and
marry
the
girl
if
she
is
in
earnest
as
such
a
course
would
only
call
forth
his
protests
of
undying
devotion
to
herself
but
she
will
imperceptibly
let
him
see
that
she
is
no
mate
for
him
and
he
will
think
he
has
found
it
out
for
himself
he
may
feel
a
little
ashamed
at
leaving
her
but
she
will
make
it
easy
for
him
and
perhaps
give
a
sigh
of
relief
that
she
has
been
saved
from
making
a
fool
of
herself
the
dark
side
for
the
woman
who
marries
a
man
much
younger
than
herself
there
is
the
inevitable
picture
of
later
life
to
be
faced
the
ridicule
of
society
will
be
felt
if
it
is
not
heard
the
advance
of
age
is
relentless
and
will
make
her
an
old
woman
when
he
is
just
in
his
prime
she
may
pray
for
death
to
come
and
set
him
free
or
she
may
paint
her
face
and
wear
a
golden
wig
accentuating
the
ruthless
lines
round
her
tired
eyes
but
if
they
live
long
enough
both
husband
and
wife
will
suffer
the
old
man
who
courts
youth
the
older
we
get
the
younger
we
like
them
was
a
favourite
saying
of
an
old
squire
i
used
to
know
there
are
old
men
who
seem
to
have
lost
but
little
of
youth
vitality
and
whom
many
a
girl
would
be
proud
to
marry
there
are
others
and
it
seems
like
an
act
of
sacrilege
to
let
any
young
life
be
linked
to
what
remains
of
theirs
the
old
man
disarms
suspicion
by
his
fatherly
attitude
and
the
beginnings
of
courtship
are
made
easy
by
the
latitude
allowed
to
his
years
his
experience
stands
him
in
good
stead
an
old
unmarried
man
has
generally
either
a
very
good
or
a
very
bad
reason
for
being
single
the
girl
who
marries
her
grandfather
contemporary
will
probably
regain
her
freedom
while
still
in
her
prime
but
she
can
not
calculate
beforehand
what
price
she
will
have
paid
for
it
the
real
love
of
an
old
man
must
have
much
pathos
in
it
and
she
who
accepts
it
must
deal
tenderly
with
it
even
in
her
moments
of
disillusion
the
elderly
rake
who
buys
a
young
wife
from
entirely
selfish
motives
will
see
that
he
does
not
lose
by
the
bargain
lovers
no
one
would
wish
that
the
couple
to
whom
love
has
come
when
youth
has
passed
should
take
their
pleasure
sadly
but
one
does
look
for
a
and
dignity
that
shall
be
compatible
with
maturity
the
woman
of
can
love
perhaps
more
deeply
than
the
girl
of
eighteen
she
can
experience
the
full
joy
of
being
beloved
but
she
only
exposes
herself
to
ridicule
if
she
takes
the
public
into
her
confidence
it
is
not
only
bad
taste
to
see
such
a
one
gushing
over
her
lover
aping
the
little
ways
of
sweet
seventeen
and
coquetting
like
a
kitten
telling
the
curious
world
in
fact
how
rejoiced
she
is
to
be
no
more
an
unappropriated
blessing
poor
soul
it
may
be
that
she
has
put
through
weary
years
of
heart
loneliness
but
surely
she
might
have
learnt
to
hold
her
joy
as
sacred
as
her
sorrow
let
her
smarten
herself
up
by
all
means
her
happiness
will
suit
nice
gowns
and
dainty
lace
let
her
choose
warm
colours
and
handsome
fabrics
and
shun
white
muslin
and
blue
ribbons
the
man
the
lover
may
be
as
impulsive
as
a
boy
and
his
friends
will
smile
but
not
with
the
contempt
they
would
show
to
the
woman
he
is
generally
very
much
in
earnest
even
if
his
motive
be
practical
rather
than
romantic
he
should
be
most
careful
never
to
hurt
the
woman
he
has
chosen
by
neglecting
her
for
younger
fresher
faces
he
should
not
suppose
that
she
is
too
old
to
care
for
attentions
no
woman
is
ever
too
old
for
that
he
should
not
make
her
a
by
talking
as
if
she
were
sweet
and
twenty
or
draw
notice
to
the
fact
that
she
has
passed
her
first
youth
she
will
enjoy
being
taken
care
of
being
planned
for
and
being
eased
of
her
burdens
but
while
showing
her
all
courtesy
let
him
give
her
credit
for
some
for
she

so
far
to
get
through

to
strike
the
responsive
chord
when
the
two
minds
are
in
harmony
a
man
who
tries
to
propose
when
a
servant
is
expected
to
arrive
with
a
scuttle
of
coals
or
when
the
children
are
just
tumbling
in
from
school
is
not
likely
to
meet
with
much
favour
we
can
not
all
have
the
momentous
question
put
in
the
witching
hour
of
moonlight
or
in
the
suggestive
stillness
of
a
summer
eve
but
the
tactful
man
will
know
when
to
speak
and
how
to
turn
dull
prose
into
the
sweetest
rhythm
too
much
haste
i
do
know
of
a
case
where
two
young
people
made
acquaintance
wooed
and
married
in
something
over
a
fortnight
no
sane
man
would
advocate
such
haste
it
seems
almost
an
impertinence
for
a
lover
to
ask
a
woman
to
give
herself
into
his
keeping
when
he
has
only
just
made
his
entrance
into
her
life
it
must
be
admitted
that
love
defies
time
as
well
as
locksmiths
a
few
hours
may
bring
kindred
souls
nearer
to
each
other
than
double
the
number
of
years
would
do
in
an
ordinary
acquaintance
on
board
ship
especially
in
the
tropics
things
mature
with
a
rapidity
seldom
found
ashore
certain
circumstances
conspire
to
hasten
the
happy
development
and
certain
conditions
may
justify
exceptional
haste
when
a
long
separation
is
pending
a
man
may
be
forgiven
for
hurrying
to
know
his
fate
but
for
the
ordinary
man
to
be
introduced
one
week
and
propose
the
next
is
to
put
it
mildly
a
doubtful
compliment
too
keen
a
sense
of
humour
a
momentary
realisation
of
the
comic
side
of
things
may
dash
the
cup
of
happiness
from
a
woman
lips
an
involuntary
smile
will
be
taken
for
heartlessness
by
the
man
who
is
so
terribly
in
earnest
a
humorous
word
will
be
little
short
of
an
insult
a
jest
but
a
proof
of
scorn
his
vanity
if
not
his
heart
will
receive
a
wound
that
is
not
lightly
to
be
healed
there
are
those
who
laugh
from
sheer
nervous
excitement
let
them
not
lose
the
men
they
love
by
a
lack
of
that
may
be
so
cruelly
misconstrued
some
things
to
avoid
the
nervous
unready
wooer
both
endures
and
inflicts
agonies
of
mind
if
he
tries
to
make
a
verbal
offer
he
had
much
better
write
for
then
he
will
at
least
be
intelligible
the
vacillating
woman
has
no
right
to
let
a
man
propose
to
her
and
then
accept
him
just
because
she
can
not
make
up
her
mind
to
tell
him
the
truth
she
may
mean
to
be
kind
but
she
only
causes
unnecessary
pain
no
woman
is
justified
in
keeping
a
man
in
suspense
while
she
angles
for
a
better
matrimonial
prize
no
honourable
offer
of
marriage
should
be
rejected
rudely
unkindly
or
with
scorn
let
there
be
but
few
words
spoken
but
let
them
be
simple
courteous
and
above
all
definite
let
him
see
that
you
are
sensible
of
the
honour
he
has
done
you
even
while
you
retain
the
right
to
dispose
of
your
heart
as
you
think
best
vaguely
worded
offers
it
is
said
that
the
indefinite
form
of
proposal
is
in
favour
at
present
it
would
seem
that
however
he
may
elect
to
say
it
the
man
should
clearly
make
the
lady
understand
that
he
is
asking
her
to
be
his
wife
she
can
not
very
well
urge
him
to
be
explicit
and
while
a
modest
woman
might
thus
lose
her
lover
an
intriguing
female
might
annex
a
man
who
had
never
intended
to
propose
to
her
the
suitor
should
be
quite
frank
as
to
his
social
position
and
means
it
may
be
necessary
to
enter
into
private
details
of
his
past
life
he
should
not
conceal
anything
like
family
disgrace
from
the
one
he
is
asking
to
share
his
name
her
point
of
view
a
woman
who
loves
will
not
need
to
be
told
how
to
answer
her
request
both
lips
and
eyes
will
be
eloquent
without
a
teacher
there
may
be
cases
where
a
woman
is
justified
in
accepting
a
man
for
whom
she
only
feels
liking
and
respect
provided
she
has
been
quite
frank
with
him
and
he
is
content
to
have
it
so
if
a
man
has
the
fidelity
and
pertinacity
to
ask
a
woman
a
second
or
third
time
he
may
find
that
the
intervening
years
have
worked
in
his
favour
but
no
woman
should
say
yes
merely
because
she
is
tired
of
saying
no
when
she
may
take
the
initiative
folk
say
never
an
american
writer
who
calls
himself
a
speculative
bachelor
has
quite
another
idea
on
the
subject
he
asks
shall
girls
propose
why
is
it
that
in
the
matter
of
initiative
a
coarse
unattractive
young
man
should
have
the
privilege
to
ask
any
unmarried
woman
in
the
whole
world
to
marry
him
while
his
refined
and
much
more
accomplished
sister
must
make
no
motion
towards
any
choice
of
her
own
except
to
sit
still
and
wait
for
some
other
girl
mediocre
brother
to
make
a
proposal
to
her
he
goes
on
to
suggest
that
the
practice
is
a
survival
of
asiatic
barbarism
while
there
is
no
denying
the
truth
of
the
above
picture
it
does
go
against
the
grain
to
think
of
a
woman
asking
a
man
to
marry
her
we
know
that
ladies
of
queenly
rank
have
to
do
it
and
lose
no
dignity
thereby
but
we
are
not
all
anxious
to
be
royal
there
is
something
repellent
in
the
idea
of
a
direct
offer
of
marriage
coming
from
a
woman
lips
indirectly
however
she
may
do
much
to
further
her
own
happiness
when
she
may
help
a
lady
of
high
rank
may
take
the
initiative
in
breaking
down
the
barrier
of
social
inequality
which
she
sees
is
standing
between
her
and
her
lover
for
a
man
who
would
be
held
back
by
such
a
consideration
would
be
worth
bending
to
the
very
wealthy
woman
who
is
so
often
wooed
for
her
banking
account
yet
is
well
worthy
to
be
loved
for
herself
may
see
with
secret
joy
that
only
his
comparative
poverty
is
holding
back
the
man
of
her
choice
and
she
lets
love
melt
the
golden
barrier
that
is
keeping
them
apart
the
woman
whose
heart
has
gone
out
to
one
physically
handicapped
in
the
race
with
his
fellows
who
knows
that
were
he
as
other
men
he
would
woo
her
with
the
love
he
is
now
too
noble
to
express
surely
she
may
take
the
initiative
and
only
gain
in
womanly
sweetness
by
so
doing
the
woman
who
realises
that
the
assurance
of
her
love
and
faith
will
impel
the
man
to
more
strenuous
effort
and
make
his
working
and
waiting
brighter
for
the
goal
that
lies
beyond
may
be
forgiven
if
in
her
intense
sympathy
she
betray
somewhat
of
her
desire
to
crown
his
success
a
warning
there
must
be
no
mistake
made
the
wish
must
not
be
father
to
the
thought
she
must
be
sure
that
she
is
beloved
and
desired
she
must
throw
out
the
most
delicate
feelers
so
sensitive
that
they
will
at
once
detect
coldness
and
withdraw
into
the
shell
of
her
reserve
she
must
not
offer
herself
unsought
she
may
not
fling
herself
into
the
arms
of
any
man
pity
whether
there
are
any
women
who
avail
themselves
of
the
supposed
privilege
of
leap
year
is
a
question
that
can
only
be
answered
by
those
who
possibly
prefer
to
keep
silence
it
is
a
questionable
joke
when
a
man
says
before
his
wife
that
she
married
him
but
can
any
woman
conceive
the
humiliation
of
having
such
words
with
the
sting
of
truth
in
them
flung
at
her
in
the
moment
of
passion
or
with
the
cool
contempt
of
scorn

goes
first
to
the
principal
person
and
when
fortified
by
her
consent
bravely
faces
the

it
is

for

a
pronounced
objection

him

without
cringing
there
should
be
no

that
he

asking
a

probable
date
at
which
he
will
be

must
not

somewhat
closely

heartfelt
words
are
better
than

the

elegance
of
phrase
in

it
is
often
difficult
to
be
quite
sincere
in
offering
our
congratulations
for
our
friends
choose
rather
oddly
to
our
tastes
sometimes
when
the
choice
of
your
dear
friend
falls
on
your
pet
abomination
the
case
is
hard
indeed
you
can
congratulate
though
you
want
to
tell
him
she
is
worlds
too
good
for
him
but
what
to
say
to
when
you
feel
that
she
is
making
a
disastrous
match
is
a
painful
problem
you
can
honestly
wish
that
her
brightest
dreams
may
be
realised
even
where
you
have
little
hope
of
it
let
there
be
no
bitterness
in
the
congratulations
respect
the
happiness
of
the
lovers
even
if
you
can
not
understand
it
the
ring
in
choosing
the
ring
the
lover
should
first
think
of
its
durability
and
then
of
its
sweet
symbolism
it
should
be
the
best
he
can
afford
and
the
small
detail
of
fit
is
not
to
be
ignored
the
choice
of
stones
and
style
will
depend
upon
taste
and
the
money
available
but
personally
i
like
an
engagement
ring
to
be
of
special
design
unlike
any
that
other
women
are
likely
to
wear
one
good
stone
is
far
better
than
a
number
of
smaller
ones
making
acquaintance
with
future
relations
this
is
one
of
the
sorest
trials
for
even
when
people
like
a
girl
very
well
as
a
friend
they
do
not
always
welcome
her
as
a
member
of
their
family
she
must
face
the
fact
that
they
have
not
chosen
her
and
the
more
simply
and
naturally
she
bears
herself
under
the
inevitable
criticism
the
better
it
is
fatal
to
and
make
a
good
impression
tact
and
intuition
will
do
a
great
deal
for
her
but
much
lies
in
the
power
of
his
relations
to
make
or
mar
the
happiness
of
her
entry
into
their
midst
i
know
of
a
girl
who
lived
a
long
way
from
her
who
was
made
quite
miserable
during
her
occasional
visits
to
his
home
by
the
discourtesy
of
his
sisters
he
was
in
town
all
day
and
of
course
knew
nothing
of
the
discomfort
she
endured
in
his
absence
he
knows
now
and
it
has
not
increased
his
brotherly
love
what
she
should
avoid
it
is
bad
manners
in
a
girl
to
try
and
show
off
her
power
over
her
lover
in
his
own
home
or
anywhere
else
for
the
matter
of
that
it
is
foolish
to
pretend
that
she
does
not
care
for
him
or
to
talk
of
her
as
if
it
were
her
execution
i
have
known
girls
who
did
this
she
should
not
devote
herself
exclusively
to
him
and
thereby
fail
in
courtesy
to
his
family
or
their
friends
she
should
not
boast
of
her
own
people
or
infer
that
her
home
is
superior
to
theirs
she
should
guard
especially
against
anything
that
looks
like
wishing
to
oust
her
lover
mother
from
her
place
in
his
affections
women
are
nearly
always
a
little
jealous
of
the
girls
their
sons
marry
and
care
must
be
taken
to
disarm
this
letters
when
the
introductions
take
place
mainly
by
letter
many
are
removed
from
the
path
of
the
it
only
behoves
her
to
reply
with
ready
grateful
recognition
to
the
words
of
welcome
which
should
be
gracious
and
on
the
part
of
his
friends
the
following
may
serve
as
an
example
from
his
mother
my
dear
sybil
frank
has
told
me
of
his
engagement
to
you
and
i
am
writing
to
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
and
how
fully
i
enter
into
his
happiness
i
feel
sure
my
dear

he
will
make
you
a
good
and
loving
husband
for
he
has
been
such
a
dear
son
to
me
i
have
always
prayed
that
he
might
find
a
wife
who
would
appreciate
his
love
and
share
his
highest
interests
i
am
now
satisfied
that
he
has
done
this
dear
i
want
you
to
come
and
stay
with
me
as
soon
as
you
can
so
that
we
may
learn
to
understand

other
it
ought
not
to
be
difficult
now
that
we
have
so
much
in
with
kind
love
believe
me
affectionately

alice
stanley
the
above
letter
would
imply
that
the
mother
knew
a
good
deal
about
the
girl
her
son
was
going
to
marry
and
of
course
she
would
try
to
write
in
a
cordial
strain
even
though
she
was
taking
her
future
upon
the
son
recommendation
the
girl
answer
might
be
on
these
lines
my
dear
stanley
you
can
not
think
how
glad
i
was
to
receive
your
most
kind
letter
it
is
such
a
relief
to
feel
that
you
do
not
disapprove
of
frank
choice
i
only
hope
that
you
may
still
approve
when
you
know
me
better
i
am
delighted
to
accept
your
kind
invitation
and
can
come
on
the
if
that
will
suit
you
i
can
hardly
yet
realise
my
great
happiness
and
feel
that
i
can
never
do
enough
for
with
many
thanks
for
your
kindness
believe
me
with
love
yours

chapter
ix
visits
to
her
home
the
engaged
couple
in
public
in
society
visiting
at
the
same
house
going
about
together
the
question
of
his
visits
to
her
home
if
distance
parts
the
loving
couple
he
will
only
be
able
to
spend
his
leave
or
annual
holidays
with
her
and
will
make
a
point
of
consulting
her
movements
before
he
lays
any
plans
for
his
leisure
time
if
he
could
meet
her
abroad
or
at
the
seaside
he
would
not
go
off
yachting
without
her
nor
postpone
his
holiday
till
the
shooting
had
begun
rather
than
spend
the
month
of
june
with
her
in
the
suburbs
if
he
lives
in
the
same
neighbourhood
as
his
beloved
he
will
have
many
opportunities
of
being
with
her
he
ought
never
to
neglect
his
work
for
his
courtship
and
a
girl
should
be
very
careful
not
to
propose
such
a
thing
it
is
a
poor
lookout
for
their
future
if
they
put
pleasure
first
he
will
probably
be
expected
or
permitted
to
spend
two
or
three
evenings
a
week
at
her
home
dine
there
on
sundays
and
if
he
is
busy
all
the
week
devote
saturday
afternoons
to
her
entirely
a
man
of
leisure
can
make
his
own
arrangements
the
business
or
professional
man
must
do
his
when
he
can
the
engaged
couple
in
public
some
men
like
to
advertise
their
kissing
rights
said
an
engaged
man
to
me
the
other
day
but
for
my
part
i
do
think
there
should
be
anything
in
the
bearing
of
an
engaged
couple
in
public
to
indicate
that
they
are
more
than
friends
here
i
think
we
have
the
etiquette
of
the
matter
in
a
nutshell
wherever
the
lovers
are
they
will
be
supremely
conscious
of
each
other
presence
but
it
need
not
be
writ
large
over
their
actions
it
is
sometimes
debated
whether
lovers
should
kiss
in
public
as
the
sweetest
kisses
must
ever
be
those
exchanged
under
four
eyes
as
the
germans
put
it
there
seems
little
advantage
in
a
mere
conventional
peck
in
the
public
gaze
a
close
clasp
of
the
hand
a
silent
greeting
of
the
eyes
will
be
truer
to
the
love
that
is
held
too
sacred
for
exhibition
the
man
attentions
should
never
merge
into
questionable
hilarity
he
ought
to
respect
as
well
as
love
the
woman
he
hopes
to
marry
she
should
equally
avoid
gushing
and
tyrannising
over
him
to
see
a
girl
ordering
her
about
making
him
fetch
and
carry
like
a
black
boy
and
taking
his
submission
as
her
due
is
enough
to
justify
the
hope
that
the
worm
will
turn
to
some
purpose
when
she
least
expects
it
there
should
be
nothing
abject
in
love
on
either
side
it
hurts
to
see
the
look
of
entreaty
in
human
eyes
things
should
be
more
on
a
level
the
hearts
of
man
and
woman
should
give
and
take
gladly
of
their
best
with
love
that
is
pure
brave
and
unashamed
in
society
mutual
friends
will
be
sure
to
invite
the
engaged
couple
to
various
social
functions
where
it
is
possible
and
convenient
they
will
arrive
and
leave
together
he
will
naturally
be
eager
to
escort
her
about
as
much
as
he
can
they
must
however
be
prepared
to
sacrifice
themselves
on
such
occasions
he
will
see
that
she
has
all
she
wants
at
a
garden
party
or
at
home
but
he
will
not
glare
at
another
man
for
handing
her
an
ice
or
a
cup
of
tea
nor
will
he
neglect
his
duties
to
sit
in
his
sweetheart
pocket
or
stand
behind
her
chair
to
warn
off
intruders
on
the
other
hand
he
will
not
attract
attention
by
devoting
himself
to
any
one
particular
lady
or
play
into
the
hands
of
the
wanton
flirt
a
woman
or
girl
will
not
give
herself
away
by
allowing
awkward
pauses
to
break
the
conversation
because
her
thoughts
and
eyes
are
hungrily
trying
to
follow
her
lover
who
is
manfully
assisting
the
hostess
she
will
not
make
herself
conspicuous
in
her
behaviour
with
any
other
admirer
but
be
perfectly
at
ease
with
any
man
to
whom
she
may
have
occasion
to
speak
if
any
of
the
lady
friends
wish
to
make
her
acquaintance
they
will
send
him
an
invitation
to
a
dance
or
party
through
her
not
an
informal
message
but
a
card
such
as
they
send
to
their
other
guests
which
she
will
pass
on
to
him
visiting
at
the
same
house
the
engaged
couple
are
not
considered
good
company
by
outsiders
so
when
they
are
included
in
a
they
should
exercise
a
little
healthful
the
cosy
corners
shady
walks
and
secluded
nooks
are
not
their
monopoly
the
two
who
are
beginning
to
make
love
ought
to
have
a
chance
others
may
have
business
to
discuss
arrangements
to
make
or
letters
to
write
for
which
they
desire
privacy
and
the
pervading
presence
of
the
betrothed
pair
is
apt
to
become
irritating
when
etiquette
requires
that
they
should
be
parted
it
is
their
duty
to
fall
in
courteously
with
any
arrangement
their
hostess
may
make
going
about
together
the
amount
of
intercourse
will
differ
in
almost
every
case
it
seems
most
natural
that
lovers
should
go
about
together
as
much
as
possible
seeing
that
they
are
learning
to
pass
their
lives
together
the
girl
who
has
taken
little
expeditions
with
her
will
be
spared
much
of
the
embarrassment
that
might
mar
the
opening
of
the
honeymoon
if
she
felt
shy
and
strange
cut
off
from
all
her
old
moorings
they
will
spend
long
days
on
the
river
take
rambles
into
the
country
see
the
sights
of
the
town
and
do
a
hundred
other
things
that
will
be
doubly
delightful
just
because
they
are
alone
together
the
question
of
expenses
it
is
sometimes
taken
for
granted
that
the
must
pay
all
expenses
when
he
takes
his
sweetheart
about
this
i
think
should
depend
upon
circumstances
the
rich
lover
does
well
to
lavish
his
money
upon
his
future
wife
and
will
take
a
pride
in
so
doing
the
man
of
moderate
means
who
has
to
work
for
his
income
will
do
well
to
put
by
all
he
can
for
future
emergencies
and
if
the
girl
to
whom
he
is
engaged
has
her
own
money
or
an
ample
allowance
it
is
much
better
that
they
should
come
to
an
understanding
to
share
the
cost
of
their
pleasures
in
view
of
possible
necessities
this
need
not
prevent
the
poorer
man
from
spending
a
certain
amount
upon
his
love
every
now
and
then
there
will
be
special
days
when
he
will
play
the
host
and
they
will
be
days
to
both
if
she
is
going
anywhere
by
his
special
invitation
he
would
naturally
defray
her
expenses
but
on
their
weekly
jaunts
why
should
he
be
put
to
the
double
outlay
when
he
wants
to
save
all
he
can
to
start
their
home
why
should
he
reduce
his
balance
at
the
bank
by
fares
theatre
tickets
and
taxis
two
or
three
times
a
week
when
he
may
have
to
borrow
money
to
buy
their
furniture
no
girl
ought
to
expect
or
encourage
this
sort
of
thing
she
is
not
afraid
of
being
under
an
obligation
to
him
for
love
knows
no
such
thing
but
she
has
the
wisdom
to
look
ahead
chapter
x
long
or
short
engagements
broken
engagements
clandestine
engagements
when
justifiable
the
mother
in
the
secret
friends
who
act
as
there
are
i
believe
engaged
couples
who
after
parting
from
each
other
at
write
a
long
letter
before
going
to
bed
that
night
containing
all
that
they
had
not
time
to
say
if
they
have
the
time
and
energy
to
spare
it
concerns
no
one
but
themselves
but
it
seems
a
pity
to
make
a
rule
of
this
sort
as
it
may
become
a
tax
and
the
breaking
of
it
on
either
side
may
cause
pain
if
not
friction
there
will
be
times
without
number
when
delightful
little
will
have
to
be
written
they
will
come
as
a
joyful
surprise
and
be
twice
as
sweet
as
those
that
are
expected
when
daily
or
even
frequent
meetings
are
impossible
then
the
has
a
most
important
part
to
play
in
the
course
of
true
love
letters
are
a
very
valuable
addition
to
personal
intercourse
it
is
not
safe
to
judge
a
person
entirely
from
them
but
taking
them
side
by
side
with
personal
knowledge
they
throw
a
good
deal
of
light
on
a
character
the
glamour
of
the
beloved
presence
is
not
there
to
blind
the
charm
of
manner
or
voice
is
not
powerful
to
fascinate
so
the
words
stand
on
their
own
merits
sometimes
they
do
not
quite
fit
in
with
what
we
know
of
the
writer
they
show
us
another
side
of
one
we
love
it
may
be
endearing
it
may
be
the
reverse
in
any
case
the
letters
that
pass
between
an
engaged
couple
should
be
kept
absolutely
private
we
know
the
story
of
the
man
who
wrote
the
same
to
two
girls
who
discovered
his
treachery
by
comparing
their
respective
treasures
such
a
case
is
i
hope
purely
fictional
but
there
ought
to
be
some
exceptionally
good
reason
for
divulging
the
sweet
nothings
that
go
to
make
up
the
typical
for
the
one
to
whom
they
are
addressed
they
will
be
sublime
to
the
outsider
they
will
probably
be
only
ridiculous
the
length
of
engagements
considering
what
a
vital
change
marriage
is
bound
to
bring
into
the
lives
of
those
who
make
the
contract
it
would
seem
the
height
of
rashness
to
hurry
into
it
with
a
person
of
whom
one
knows
but
little
it
may
be
contended
that
the
mutual
attitude
of
lovers
during
their
engagement
is
not
calculated
to
enlarge
their
real
knowledge
of
each
other
certainly
not
if
the
marriage
is
to
take
place
while
they
are
at
living
in
a
whirl
of
emotional
rapture
but
let
an
engagement
be
long
enough
for
their
love
to
settle
down
into
a
more
normal
state
where
their
reasoning
faculties
will
be
able
to
work
then
they
will
gain
a
clearer
estimate
of
their
mutual
fitness
and
may
learn
a
good
deal
about
each
other
it
has
been
said
that
no
man
should
make
an
offer
of
marriage
till
he
is
in
a
position
to
support
a
wife
this
is
a
little
hard
if
a
man
is
worth
having
he
is
worth
waiting
for
he
has
no
right
to
speak
till
he
has
some
definite
prospect
in
view
or
unless
he
is
fully
determined
to
do
his
best
to
further
his
own
interests
no
girl
or
woman
should
be
expected
to
waste
her
youth
and
wear
out
her
heart
as
the
promised
wife
of
a
man
who
is
not
trying
to
make
their
marriage
possible
above
all
no
man
should
be
mean
enough
to
take
money
from
the
one
to
whom
he
is
engaged
merely
to
indulge
his
own
idleness
a
year
or
eighteen
months
may
be
taken
as
a
fair
time
for
the
engagement
of
those
who
have
known
but
little
of
each
other
beforehand
in
the
case
of
long
intimacy
six
months
will
probably
suffice
a
girl
exposes
herself
to
much
unpleasant
criticism
by
urging
on
a
hasty
marriage
even
if
she
feels
impatient
she
should
let
that
sort
of
thing
come
from
the
man
if
he
lets
the
time
drag
on
with
seeming
indifference
or
satisfaction
she
should
ask
one
of
her
parents
to
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
and
if
she
guesses
that
he
has
no
real
desire
to
marry
her
she
had
far
better
give
him
up
altogether
than
urge
him
to
take
the
step
unwillingly
broken
engagements
it
sometimes
happens
that
during
this
period
of
courtship
either
the
man
or
the
woman
realises
that
a
mistake
has
been
made
if
so
let
it
be
rectified
before
a
still
more
serious
one
be
committed
it
is
a
delicate
matter
for
a
man
to
take
the
initiative
no
woman
should
drive
him
to
do
so
let
her
make
him
a
present
of
his
freedom
before
he
has
to
ask
for
it
it
is
due
to
a
man
to
break
with
a
woman
who
openly
and
wantonly
disregards
his
wishes
on
any
important
point
in
the
same
way
if
a
man
will
not
give
up
bad
habits
such
as
gambling
intemperance
or
whatever
it
may
be
for
the
sake
of
the
girl
he
is
engaged
to
she
may
be
pretty
sure
that
he
will
not
do
it
when
she
is
his
wife
let
him
choose
between
her
and
his
vices
once
the
engagement
is
at
an
end
the
ring
and
other
presents
should
be
sent
back
unless
by
special
mutual
arrangement
to
the
contrary
letters
are
either
burnt
or
returned
to
the
writer
there
is
a
good
deal
of
sentiment
about
these
written
proofs
of
a
love
that
has
proved
a
failure
on
one
side
at
least
the
two
who
have
been
so
nearly
one
now
become
mere
acquaintances
again
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
will
probably
not
be
anxious
to
meet
for
some
time
to
come
clandestine
engagement
the
obstacle
to
true
love
in
former
days
was
parental
authority
which
often
savoured
of
tyranny
in
these
days
of
liberty
the
young
people
have
it
more
their
own
way
when
parents
object
to
a
lover
on
the
mere
ground
of
his
poverty
or
some
personal
prejudice
a
girl
may
be
excused
for
making
her
own
choice
when
she
is
of
age
if
she
binds
herself
secretly
to
a
man
whose
moral
unfitness
is
objected
to
she
is
courting
certain
misery
and
possible
disgrace
a
justifiable
case
it
would
seem
then
that
where
parental
consent
is
refused
on
the
ground
of
advisability
not
of
vital
principle
the
girl
is
justified
in
holding
herself
bound
till
such
time
as
she
is
free
to
give
her
hand
in
marriage
she
will
use
this
bond
as
a
defence
against
other
suitors
who
may
be
urged
upon
her
she
will
not
flaunt
her
decision
in
the
parental
face
nor
cause
ructions
by
tactlessly
obtruding
the
bone
of
contention
but
she
will
be
firm
and
loyal
true
to
herself
and
to
him
she
loves
where
the
mother
shares
the
secret
where
the
father
is
somewhat
of
a
spartan
there
is
not
unfrequently
a
gentle
sympathetic
mother
who
will
dare
much
to
make
her
child
happy
the
daughter
is
well
advised
to
make
such
a
mother
her
confidante
a
woman
who
schemes
to
entangle
a
young
man
of
wealth
or
high
rank
into
a
secret
engagement
with
her
daughter
who
she
knows
is
no
suitable
wife
for
him
is
neither
honest
to
him
nor
kind
to
her
child
such
unequal
marriages
seldom
answer
in
real
life
there
must
be
sympathy
and
a
certain
community
of
interests
to
make
marriage
a
success
friends
who
act
as
there
is
a
spice
of
romance
in
helping
distressed
and
persecuted
lovers
but
young
people
should
be
very
careful
not
to
mix
themselves
up
in
such
matters
their
own
experience
is
too
limited
to
qualify
them
for
the
task
older
friends
must
take
the
consequences
of
such
interference
sometimes
their
help
is
most
still
for
a
time
at
least
the
lovers
will
be
intensely
grateful
to
them
there
is
one
thing
that
seems
quite
unjustifiable
and
that
is
for
a
secretly
engaged
pair
to
make
a
friend
house
their
rendezvous
without
telling
the
friend
exactly
how
matters
stand
it
is
an
abuse
of
hospitality
for
it
is
pretty
sure
to
bring
unpleasantness
to
the
friend
who
will
inevitably
be
blamed
by
the
parents
when
the
secret
leaks
out
or
an
elopement
takes
place
trains
telephones
and
telegraphs
have
robbed
the
latter
episode
of
all
its
reckless
charm
and
it
really
seems
hardly
worth
the
doing
in
some
cases
a
married
friend
may
intervene
to
prevent
any
scandal
from
touching
the
wilful
bride
if
the
young
folks
will
not
listen
to
reason
it
is
as
well
for
their
folly
to
be
carried
out
as
respectably
as
possible
but
all
such
sympathy
should
be
tempered
by
judgment
for
the
making
or
marring
of
two
lives
is
in
the
balance
and
the
happiness
of
many
hearts
may
be
at
stake
chapter
xi
etiquette
of
engagements
betrothal
a
much
more
serious
matter
than
in
in
no
other
country
is
an
engagement
so
informal
as
in
england
we
find
all
sorts
of
ceremonies
connected
with
the
plighting
of
a
troth
which
seems
but
little
less
important
than
the
tying
of
the
marriage
knot
itself
there
is
less
spontaneity
and
exercise
of
private
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
young
people
in
fact
there
are
several
countries
in
which
they
are
allowed
no
voice
in
the
matter
in
italy
girls
are
kept
quite
in
the
background
and
have
a
very
dull
time
this
makes
them
ready
to
accept
any
suitor
their
parents
may
choose
a
meeting
is
arranged
between
the
young
people
and
after
that
he
pays
stiff
visits
to
her
home
generally
in
the
evening
but
they
are
never
left
alone
together
and
he
is
not
allowed
to
pay
her
any
marked
attention
even
before
others
they
may
exchange
photographs
and
she
may
work
him
a
little
present
but
it
is
all
lifeless
passionless
and
among
the
peasantry
there
is
more
of
the
picturesque
and
many
quaint
customs
still
survive
do
a
good
trade
and
get
a
percentage
on
each
pair
that
they
see
through
the
ordeal
of
a
wedding
in
frascati
parents
with
marriageable
sons
and
daughters
assemble
on
sunday
afternoons
in
the
chief
piazza
the
men
sit
on
one
side
and
the
women
on
the
other
in
the
intervening
space
the
candidates
for
matrimony
walk
about
the
girls
near
their
mothers
the
youths
under
their
fathers
eyes
by
some
mysterious
process
of
selection
they
sort
themselves
into
couples
or
rather
the
parents
make
mutual
advances
on
behalf
of
their
children
and
they
are
betrothed
in
france
similar
restrictions
are
placed
upon
lovers
and
no
one
under
the
age
of
can
contract
a
legal
marriage
without
the
consent
of
his
or
her
parents
if
three
appeals
have
been
made
in
vain
for
parental
sanction
there
may
be
an
appeal
to
the
law
the
proposed
marriage
must
also
be
publicly
announced
beforehand
or
it
is
invalid
in
there
is
a
strange
mixture
of
the
romantic
and
the
practical
the
village
tailor
is
the
usual
negotiator
who
interviews
both
the
lovers
and
their
parents
when
he
has
smoothed
the
way
the
intending
bridegroom
pays
his
first
visit
which
is
accompanied
by
many
pretty
customs
he
is
allowed
to
take
his
sweetheart
aside
and
no
one
dares
to
interrupt
this
their
first
meanwhile
the
elders
discuss
business
and
when
the
lovers
come
back
to
the
family
circle
a
feast
is
enjoyed
at
which
the
parents
bless
the
food
and
the
lovers
are
only
allowed
one
knife
and
plate
between
them
the
signing
of
the
wedding
contract
later
on
is
another
festivity
and
the
presents
are
mostly
of
a
useful
nature
german
betrothals
are
more
or
less
formal
though
the
young
couple
are
allowed
to
choose
for
themselves
the
suitor
has
not
much
chance
of
seeing
the
lady
alone
before
he
has
made
up
his
mind
he
must
be
circumspect
or
his
intentions
will
be
promptly
inquired
into
he
puts
on
his
sunday
clothes
with
lavender
kids
when
he
comes
to
ask
the
important
question
and
as
soon
as
a
satisfactory
answer
has
been
obtained
the
happy
pair
are
congratulated
by
the
family
and
the
table
is
decorated
for
the
festive
meal
they
go
out
to
call
upon
their
friends
in
a
day
or
two
and
a
formal
announcement
is
not
only
sent
round
to
all
their
acquaintance
but
is
also
inserted
in
the
daily
papers
great
attention
must
be
paid
to
the
exact
title
possessed
by
every
one
connected
with
the
happy
pair
as
titles
count
for
much
in
germany
the
engaged
girl
is
called
a
bride
and
her
lover
a
bridegroom
before
marriage
she
shows
her
prowess
in
the
culinary
line
by
preparing
the
meals
to
which
he
is
invited
they
are
not
supposed
to
travel
alone
even
if
they
are
going
to
stay
with
his
relations
some
lady
must
accompany
them
in
many
cases
the
parents
have
qualms
about
allowing
too
much
intercourse
to
the
engaged
couple
but
greater
liberty
is
gradually
being
given
in
russia
it
is
considered
a
disgrace
for
a
woman
to
be
unmarried
and
if
no
suitor
offers
himself
she
leaves
her
home
and
settles
in
a
strange
place
as
a
widow
she
may
prefer
to
travel
for
a
time
and
return
home
with
a
pitiful
tale
of
the
husband
she
lost
at
sea
or
who
died
at
the
beginning
of
the
honeymoon
the
priests
often
act
as
intermediaries
but
sometimes
a
woman
versed
in
dark
lore
makes
the
arrangements
at
the
betrothal
feast
the
girl
gives
her
lover
a
long
lock
of
her
hair
and
he
gives
her
a
silver
ring
set
with
turquoise
bread
and
salt
and
an
almond
cake
this
interchange
of
gifts
is
equal
to
a
marriage
bond
all
the
presents
have
a
symbolical
meaning
the
rings
are
bought
from
and
blessed
by
the
clergy
and
are
treasured
as
heirlooms
in
the
family
in
spain
girls
are
most
jealously
guarded
and
marriages
are
arranged
by
the
parents
still
the
romantic
element
is
not
wanting
the
young
man
sees
the
lady
who
steals
his
heart
and
begins
to
woo
her
from
a
distance
with
eyes
and
voice
till
he
can
gain
an
introduction
to
her
family
the
main
joy
in
a
spanish
courtship
is
the
clandestine
prelude
to
the
actual
engagement
he
may
follow
the
lady
about
and
serenade
her
according
to
regulations
but
he
may
not
speak
till
he
is
introduced
she
appears
to
ignore
his
attentions
but
she
misses
nothing
the
courtship
is
often
protracted
but
the
girl
is
given
freedom
of
choice
the
law
can
come
to
the
assistance
of
lovers
whose
union
is
prevented
by
their
parents
in
the
same
way
as
in
france
the
amount
of
liberty
given
to
the
engaged
couple
differs
in
various
districts
but
throughout
spain
the
love
making
may
be
said
to
end
with
marriage
in
murcia
they
may
not
meet
or
speak
unless
her
mother
is
present
and
the
lover
may
neither
touch
the
hand
nor
kiss
the
lips
of
his
sweetheart
till
she
is
his
wife
sweden
unmarried
girls
in
this
country
enjoy
an
unrivalled
reputation
for
gaiety
and
merriment
bread
is
considered
a
love
charm
and
the
two
who
eat
from
the
same
loaf
will
fall
in
love
with
each
other
the
suitor
often
sends
an
ambassador
to
a
girl
he
has
never
seen
and
if
his
proposal
is
accepted
he
calls
the
next
sunday
the
lady
is
not
supposed
to
take
any
notice
of
him
but
continues
her
knitting
in
a
stolid
fashion
in
some
parts
there
is
a
religious
betrothal
ceremony
when
plain
gold
rings
are
exchanged
but
the
more
usual
way
of
celebrating
an
engagement
is
by
a
social
festivity
the
lover
must
give
a
to
his
future
bride
which
consists
of
a
gold
or
silver
cup
the
size
is
not
stipulated
filled
with
coins
wrapped
up
in
quite
new
white
he
also
gives
her
a
while
she
offers
in
return
some
garment
she
has
made
for
him
herself
if
it
is
a
shirt
he
wears
it
on
his
and
then
lays
it
aside
to
wear
in
his
grave
these
quaint
customs
are
mostly
found
in
the
country
districts
merely
send
out
cards
with
the
names
of
the
pair
printed
on
each
one
and
further
announcements
appear
in
the
papers
in
switzerland
there
is
not
much
romance
in
either
wooing
or
wedding
the
swiss
may
not
marry
till
the
youth
is
eighteen
and
the
girl
sixteen
and
up
to
the
age
of
twenty
the
consent
of
parents
or
guardians
is
necessary
when
the
time
draws
near
for
the
wedding
the
pair
must
go
together
to
a
civil
officer
and
must
each
present
him
with
a
certificate
of
birth
and
tell
him
their
ages
names
professions
and
where
they
and
where
their
parents
live
he
then
writes
a
deed
containing
their
promise
of
marriage
which
must
be
made
public
for
at
least
a
fortnight
in
the
places
where
they
were
born
where
they
are
living
at
the
time
and
where
they
wish
to
be
married
if
nobody
makes
an
objection
the
ceremony
can
take
place
is
sacred
to
lovers
in
lucerne
he
plants
a
small
decorated
before
her
house
at
dawn
and
if
he
is
accepted
a
right
royal
feast
is
prepared
for
him
the
little
tree
is
treasured
till
the
first
baby
appears
a
swiss
peasant
girl
is
often
compelled
to
take
the
lover
who
lives
nearest
to
her
home
as
the
introduction
of
an
outsider
is
resented
by
the
men
of
the
place
the
hungarian
likes
to
linger
over
his
wooing
and
he
is
a
past
master
in
the
art
the
lovers
have
absolute
freedom
of
intercourse
and
secure
privacy
in
the
family
circle
by
making
a
tent
of
his
large
graceful
cloak
under
which
they
sit
and
make
love
undisturbed
all
the
actual
formalities
go
through
a
third
person
and
much
ceremony
is
observed
in
the
negotiations
the
first
stage
of
courtship
is
marked
by
the
loving
cup
feast
and
the
binding
betrothal
is
known
as
the
kissing
feast
in
norway
courtship
is
of
necessity
a
very
long
process
among
the
peasant
folk
for
money
is
not
easily
earned
and
no
man
may
marry
till
he
is
a
householder
while
houses
may
only
be
built
in
certain
places
and
under
fixed
regulations
seven
years
is
quite
an
average
time
for
an
engagement
during
which
they
do
their
in
a
simple
unaffected
manner
no
man
ever
jilts
a
woman
and
broken
engagements
are
almost
unknown
in
parents
pay
a
man
to
marry
their
daughter
and
no
man
may
marry
till
all
his
own
sisters
are
provided
with
and
dowers
the
girl
who
an
offer
of
marriage
in
is
for
ever
disgraced
her
father
may
give
her
away
or
her
husband
may
drag
her
by
her
hair
to
his
own
tent
and
it
is
all
right
she
must
be
married
by
capture
against
her
own
will
and
the
love
comes
afterwards
if
at
all
a
thuringian
girl
gives
her
suitor
sausage
to
eat
as
a
sign
that
he
is

if

for
himself
on

the

courtship
is
marriage
which
should
take

as
soon
as

to
serve

but
in

may
appears
to
be

supposed

be
unlucky
for

the
reason
for
this
does
not
seem
clear
the
couplet
if
married
in
lent
you
are
sure
to
repent
is
an
echo
from
the
days
when
church
discipline
was
stricter
than
it
is
now
and
the
time
set
apart
for
spiritual
sorrow
was
not
considered
suitable
for
the
crowning
of
earthly
happiness
even
in
the
present
day
very
few
marriages
are
celebrated
during
the
season
of
lent
there
are
many
people
and
things
to
take
into
account
when
fixing
the
important
date
if
the
bridegroom
elect
is
not
his
own
master
a
time
must
be
chosen
when
he
is

to
be
at
liberty
it
was
said
of
the
late
sir
walter
besant
that
he
was
so
overwhelmed
with
business
that
he
hardly
had
time
to
be
married
the
bride
father
has
also
to
be
considered
and
if
any
particular
church
dignitary
is
required
to
perform
the
ceremony
his
engagements
will
have
to
be
taken
into
account
when
possible
it
is
well
to
let
a
good
interval
elapse
between
the
final
decision
and
the
day
itself
a
month
or
six
weeks
is
none
too
much
more
than
this
is
often
allowed
the
bride
burden
there
is
a
great
deal
of
mental
wear
and
tear
for
the
to
go
through
in
the
few
weeks
immediately
before
her
marriage
and
it
is
a
pity
that
it
should
be
so
the
fuss
and
display
at
an
wedding
make
it
a
thing
to
quail
before
dress
has
become
so
extravagant
and
absorbing
that
in
the
matter
of
her
clothes
alone
the
girl
has
her
time
pretty
well
taken
up
instead
of
being
able
to
prepare
calmly
and
restfully
for
the
most
vital
step
in
life
she
is
kept
in
a
ceaseless
whirl
of
mental
and
physical
excitement
till
she
is
worn
out
in
any
case
care
should
be
taken
to
avoid
a
rush
at
the
last
let
her
have
at
least
a
few
days
of
peace
and
quietness
in
which
to
prepare
for
the
great
event
how
can
she
realise
the
solemnity
of
the
vows
she
is
going
to
make
or
the
gravity
of
the
responsibility
she
is
taking
upon
her
shoulders
if
she
never
has
a
moment
to
think
and
is
being
hurried
from
milliner
to
dressmaker
from
jeweller
to
shoemaker
from
furrier
to
glovemaker
day
in
day
out
the
choice
of
the
bridesmaids
in
some
families
this
is
a
difficult
matter
and
may
be
the
cause
of
much
friction
the
bride
sisters
if
she
has
any
take
precedence
there
may
be
a
dear
friend
who
has
been
promised
this
office
since
she
and
the
bride
were
at
school
together
but
then
sisters
expect
to
be
asked
and
they
may
be
neither
attractive
nor
very
young
when
the
desired
number
is
but
small
the
problem
is
sometimes
solved
by
having
two
or
three
children
and
forswearing
all
adults
this
is
certainly
a
prettier
and
less
expensive
arrangement
for
children
look
more
picturesque
as
bridesmaids
than
the
average
girls
who
can
not
be
chosen
for
their
appearance
elderly
bridesmaids
in
youthful
frocks
and
girlish
hats
are
ridiculous
to
the
unthinking
but
pathetic
to
those
who
look
below
the
surface
wedding
frocks
married
in
white
you
have
chosen
all
right
says
the
old
rhyme
and
the
ivory
duchesse
satin
seems
to
have
come
to
stay
there
should
however
be
some
regard
for
the
future
social
position
of
the
bride
in
choosing
the
wedding
gown
the
girl
who
is
marrying
a
man
with
a
small
income
and
who
is
prepared
to
begin
housekeeping
on
a
simple
scale
is
not
likely
to
want
a
magnificent
satin
with
a
court
train
a
much
less
expensive
frock
would
answer
her
requirements
far
better
for
with
the
fashions
the
costly
material
would
have
to
be
cut
up
and
altered
many
a
time
before
it
was
worn
out
it
is
a
pity
to
weigh
down
a
young
girlish
bride
with
heavy
brocades
and
silks
that
stand
alone
her
freshness
and
beauty
will
stand
a
simpler
setting
and
look
all
the
sweeter
in
it
there
are
so
many
soft
diaphanous
fabrics
made
now
which
fall
into
graceful
draperies
that
i
would
like
the
young
bride
clad
in
some
of
them
the
bridesmaids
dresses
the
choice
of
a
costume
for
the
bridesmaids
is
not
an
easy
matter
you
can
find
one
that
will
suit
two
sisters
to
perfection
but
there
are
the
others
with
possibly
such
colouring
as
to
forbid
the
very
thing
that
another
will
look
her
best
in
white
is
taken
as
being
generally
safe
and
becoming
but
when
worn
unrelieved
in
the
daytime
it
is
very
trying
to
some
there
are
also
the
height
and
build
of
the
various
girls
to
be
considered
so
altogether
the
matter
demands
much
care
and
taste
expense
the
question
of
cost
should
not
be
ignored
unless
the
bride
is
in
a
position
to
give
all
the
dresses
then
she
may
be
as
lavish
as
she
thinks
fit
it
is
hardly
fair
to
expect
her
friends
to
go
to
the
most
expensive
house
and
to
buy
the
most
costly
hats
and
frocks
which
will
perhaps
be
of
little
use
to
them
afterwards
merely
for
her
personal
gratification
this
is
especially
the
case
where
two
sisters
are
asked
to
be
bridesmaids
a
girl
may
long
to
attend
her
friend
to
the
altar
and
yet
be
obliged
to
decline
because
her
parents
can
not
afford
the
outlay
necessitated
by
the
extravagance
of
the
costume
if
one
has
her
frock
made
by
an
artiste
the
others
must
follow
suit
or
the
picture
is
spoilt
the
bride
who
is
married
in
her
travelling
dress
does
not
have
bridesmaids
but
attendants
whose
dresses
should
harmonise
but
not
eclipse
her
own
due
regard
should
be
paid
to
the
time
of
year
in
the
choice
of
materials
white
gauzy
frocks
look
chill
and
comfortless
in
even
if
the
wearers
do
not
shiver
perceptibly
and
are
not
afflicted
with
red
noses
but
soft
thick
fabrics
like
white
cloth
or
velvet
trimmed
with
touches
of
fur
suggest
the
warmth
that
lies
beneath

well

the

a
young
friend
of
mine
who
was
going
to
be
married
last
year
said
to
me
oh
my

are
so
lovely
i
never
knew
how
delightful
it
was
to
be
able
to
have
all
the
beautiful
things
you
want
this
sentiment
will
be
echoed
by
most
of
the
dowered
brides
of
there
is
generally
a
fixed
sum
set
apart
for
the
trousseau
and
the
amount
must
necessarily
control
the
extent
of
the
purchases
the
and
underwear
can
be
obtained
from
about
ten
guineas
with
prices
varying
according
to
the
number
and
quality
of
the
garments
up
to
forty
or
fifty
guineas
dresses
boots
and
shoes
and
all
wear
including
hats
must
be
added
on
to
this
outlay
few
people
buy
many
dresses
at
once
now
on
account
of
the
changeful
whims
of
fashion
but
the
great
point
is
to
have
the
few
gowns
of
good
material
and
excellent
cut
there
are
a
hundred
items
only
known
to
a
woman
or
her
maid
with
which
the
bride
should
be
well
stocked
it
is
a
disgrace
to
don
a
costly
when
you
have
not
a
decent
or
to
load
yourself
with
finery
when
your
stockings
are
in
holes
feminine
attire
is
so
dainty
and
fascinating
in
the
present
day
that
there
is
a
danger
of
setting
more
value
on
the
trimmings
and
make
than
on
the
quality
of
the
material
let
the
try
to
picture
her
pretty
things
when
they
emerge
from
the
ruthless
hands
of
a
laundress
and
she
will
realise
the
value
of
quality
where
anything
like
regular
or
hard
wear
is
required
it
is
always
good
economy
to
buy
the
best
all
garments
that
need
to
be
marked
must
have
the
initials
of
the
married
name
upon
them
all
women
are
supposed
to
love
shopping
surely
no
expeditions
can
be
so
delightful
as
going
to
buy
the
trousseau

a
purse

these
are
sent
out
by

acts
in
that

good

will
have
plenty
of

as

any
friend
who
has

a

before
the
invitations
are
out
must
be
invited
the
general
feeling
seems
to
be
that
an
invitation
to
a
wedding
involves
a
present
and
that
is
rather
a
tax
it
also
takes
away
from
that
purely
voluntary
spirit
which
is
the
beauty
of
a

in
some
cases
friends
are
only
asked
to

the
reception

confined

a

who
lives
at
a
distance
must
be
asked
to
stay
at
the
bride
home
for
a
few
days
before
the
wedding
the
death
of
a
near
relation
would
necessitate
the
postponement
of
the
wedding
and
this
would
cancel
all
invitations
in
cases
of
loss
more
remote
from
the
young
couple
the
wedding
takes
place
soon
after
the
first
date
but
quietly
owing
to
family
bereavement
a
notice
to
this
effect
is
often
put
in
the
papers
when
a
marriage
has
been
publicly
announced
but
in
a
more
private
affair
notes
would
be
sent
to
those
who
had
been

the

becomes
a

proportionately
heavy
to
the

it
seems
a
pity
that
there
should
be
so
much
vulgarising
advertisement
about
what
are
supposed
to
be

there
is
also

much
routine
in

choice
of
the
gifts
themselves
the

and
are
monotonous
and
while
comparative
strangers
may
be

good
silver
is
always
a
joy
except
perhaps
when
you
have
to
keep
it

the
young
wife
with
only
one
servant
will
have
to
rub
up
her
own
silver
backed
brushes
and
sweetmeat
dishes
if
she
wants
them
to
look
nice
of
course
it
may
be
said
that
extra
silver
can
be
put
by
till
circumstances
improve
or
that
it
might
be
useful
in
a
financial
emergency
this
last
idea
is
rather
a
gruesome
one
to
take
to
a
wedding
and
it
is
in
the
early
days
of
her
housekeeping
that
the
young
wife
likes
to
have
her
pretty
things
about
her
why
an
artistic
chair
or
table
should
not
be
as
suitable
as
an
i

not
quite
see
and
if
a
place
is
to
look

pictures
are
quite
as
necessary
as

a
temptation
both
bride
and
bridegroom
receive
presents
some
for
individual
others
for
mutual
use
the
bride
must
promptly
and
personally
acknowledge
all
those
that
are
sent
to
her
and
the
bridegroom
does
the
same
on
his
own
account
presents
from
mutual
friends
would
be
mutually
acknowledged
especially
if
the
gift
were
sent
to
both
of
them
when
one
does
not
feel
very
kindly
disposed
to
the
man
or
woman
whom
our
dear
friend
is
going
to
marry
there
is
a
great
temptation
i
do
know
that
it
need
be
resisted
to
send
a
gift
that
will
be
the
property
and
pleasure
of
that
friend
and
not
to
give
the
mutual
into
which
both
will
dip
the
spoon
how
to
send
them
all
wedding
presents
should
be
nicely
and
daintily
packed
up
sometimes
they
are
better
sent
from
the
shop
direct
but
in
that
case
the
card
or
cards
of
the
donors
should
accompany
them
many
people
tie
their
cards
on
with
narrow
white
ribbon
and
anything
that
adds
to
the
daintiness
of
a
present
is
to
be
commended
it
is
a
very
sensible
plan
for
relations
to
let
the
young
people
choose
their
own
sideboard
or
dinner
service
instead
of
buying
it
for
them
there
is
only
one
drawback
to
this
arrangement
the
thing
that
costs
the
most
is
so
often
the
thing
we
want
most
even
before
we
know
the
price
and
it
would
not
be
nice
to
feel
we
had
trespassed
on
the
generosity
of
the
giver
by
inducing
him
to
spend
more
than
he
intended
it
is
becoming
the
fashion
for
members
of
a
family
to
club
together
and
give
a
handsome
piece
of
jewellery
instead
of
each
one
presenting
a
smaller
trinket
this
might
well
be
done
with
more
practical
presents
the
art
of
giving
much
of
the
pleasure
afforded
by
a
gift
is
contained
in
the
way
it
is
given
there
is
an
exquisite
art
in
giving
many
people
choose
a
present
just
because
they
happen
to
like
the
thing
themselves
whereas
a
gift
should
be
selected
entirely
with
a
view
to
the
pleasure
or
use
it
will
afford
to
its
future
owner
a
grand
piano
is
no
good
to
a
girl
who
will
not
have
a
room
large
enough
to
hold
it
and
herself
costly
china
is
only
an
encumbrance
to
a
woman
who
is
going
to
follow
the
fortunes
of
her
soldier
husband
and
who
will
not
have
a
settled
home
for
years
there
must
be
kindly
sympathy
in
the
choice
of
gifts
as
well
as
tact
and
courtesy
in
the
offering
of
them
the
selection
of
the
house
whenever
it
is
possible
the
young
or
newly
married
couple
should
start
their
life
together
in
a
home
of
their
own
i
would
warn
all
brides
to
superintend
the
choice
of
that
home
a
man
certainly
one
of
the
nicest
kind
has
not
what
may
be
called
a
domestic
eye
if
he
is
artistic
he
will
choose
a
dwelling
for
its
picturesqueness
regardless
of
drains
and
dank
ditches
near
the
house
an
inert
man
will
value
his
home
for
its
proximity
to
the
station
another
considers
the
garden
the
most
important
feature
the
will
be
influenced
by
the
place
which
affords
the
most
scope
for
the
pursuit
of
his
hobbies
men
can
not
gauge
the
amount
of
work
that
may
be
made
or
saved
by
the
build
of
a
house
and
the
arrangement
of
its
rooms
the
question
of
cupboards
and
the
aspect
of
the
larder
and
condition
of
the
kitchen
range
are
things
that
do
not
appeal
to
the
masculine
mind
especially
when
that
mind
is
in
love
if
the
bride
is
young
and
inexperienced
she
will
do
well
to
visit
the
projected
abode
with
some
practised
housewife
the
expeditions
taken
by
the
engaged
couple
in
search
of
their
new
home
ought
surely
to
be
among
their
sweetest
experiences
even
taking
into
account
the
misleading
tactics
of
the
house
agent
furnishing
in
olden
days
when
the
daughters
of
eve
span
the
bride
provided
all
the
household
linen
most
of
which
had
taken
shape
under
her
own
fair
fingers
now
the
intending
bridegroom
furnishes
the
house
throughout
if
the
bride
father
were
wealthy
and
generous
enough
to
make
them
a
present
of
the
lining
for
the
nest
i
do
not
suppose
the
bridegroom
or
the
bride
would
have
any
objection
one
argument
for
not
furnishing
till
after
the
wedding
is
that
many
of
the
presents
in
money
and
kind
might
be
valuable
adjuncts
but
then
those
presents
would
come
from
near
relations
who
could
tell
the
young
people
what
to
expect
a
chest
of
plate
or
a
box
of
linen
a
piano
or
some
such
handsome
item
often
comes
from
some
one
in
the
bride
family
but
failing
such
gifts
the
bridegroom
must
supply
the
new
home
with
all
needful
articles
the
bride
share
in
the
matter
as
she
is
to
be
the
mistress
of
the
establishment
the
bride
should
have
a
voice
in
all
that
concerns
it
many
departments
of
house
furnishing
do
not
require
the
assistance
of
the
male
mind
at
all
they
will
both
like
to
choose
the
actual
household
gods
to
discuss
schemes
of
colour
and
decoration
together
but
no
woman
need
take
a
man
to
buy
saucepans
or
request
his
opinion
on
such
soft
matters
as
pillows
and
blankets
it
will
please
his
mother
if
the
bride
consults
her
about
domestic
details
and
in
any
case
she
will
profit
by
the
advice
of
one
who
has
been
there
things
to
be
considered
however
small
it
is
the
newly
married
pair
should
have
their
home
to
themselves
and
it
is
as
well
not
to
settle
immediately
under
the
parental
eye
on
either
side
like
kipling
ship
they
have
to
find
themselves
and
they
will
do
it
far
better
alone
together
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
good
for
a
bride
to
be
set
down
in
an
utterly
strange
neighbourhood
where
she
will
not
know
a
soul
till
the
people
are
thoroughly
satisfied
as
to
her
respectability
this
as
we
shall
see
later
may
constitute
a
grave
danger
the
husband
should
think
of
his
wife
daily
round
as
well
as
of
his
own
train
service
to
town
or
the
house
proximity
to
the
golf
links
they
should
go
to
some
place
within
easy
reach
of
friends
or
where
they
have
good
introductions
to
possible
people
when
preparing
to
start
life
together
they
should
not
be
too
ambitious
because
she
has
been
brought
up
in
a
big
house
he
is
doing
her
no
kindness
by
saddling
himself
with
a
higher
rent
than
he
can
really
afford
to
pay
she
is
quite
willing
to
take
him
in
exchange
for
the
extra
accommodation
that
she
is
giving
up
that
is

she
is

right
sort

fees
for

a
marriage
by
certificate
costs
about
ten
or
twelve
shillings
with
a

the
expense
mounts
up
to
about
settlements
this
is
a
matter
of
cold
unromantic
fact
and
one
which
very
ardent
impossible
lovers
regard
almost
in
the
light
of
a
desecration
as
the
prosaic
side
of
life
has
to
be
faced
it
is
very
necessary
that
money
matters
should
find
a
place
in
the
matrimonial
preparations
an
honourable
man
is
always
anxious
to
effect
some
arrangement
by
which
his
wife
may
be
safeguarded
from
ruin
or
extreme
poverty
if
she
has
money
of
her
own
he
will
see
that
it
is
settled
upon
her
absolutely
should
he
raise
or
even
hint
at
an
objection
to
this
plan
he
will
lay
himself
open
to
a
serious
charge
of
possessing
mercenary
motives
a
man
with
private
means
would
settle
a
certain
portion
upon
his
wife
but
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
she
would
only
have
the
interest
of
this
amount
and
would
not
have
control
over
the
capital
during
his
life
at
the
same
time
it
could
not
be
touched
by
his
creditors
in
more
legal
language
by
marriage
settlements
the
property
to
be
settled
by
one
or
both
of
the
parties
is
conveyed
to
trustees
upon
trust
as
to
the
lady
property
for
her
separate
use
during
her
life
and
after
her
decease
for
the
husband
for
his
life
the
property
is
settled
on
him
for
life
with
remainder
to
the
wife
for
life
on
the
death
of
the
survivor
the
trust
is
for
the
children
of
the
marriage
in
such
shares
as
the
husband
and
wife
or
the
survivor
appoint
and
in
default
of
appointment
among
the
children
equally
clauses
as
to
maintenance
and
education
of
the
children
and
powers
of
investment
of
trust
funds
are
inserted
in
settling
large
estates
and
sums
of
money
various
modes
of
settlement
are
adopted
to
suit
the
circumstances
but
the
above
is
the
outline
of
an
ordinary
settlement
large
landed
estates
are
generally
settled
after
the
decease
of
the
settlers
upon
the
first
and
other
sons
in
tail
male
with
cross
remainders
between
them
and
in
default
of
male
issue
among
the
daughters
the
bride
dowry
or
marriage
portion
is
of
very
ancient
origin
even
two
centuries
before
christ
the
wealth
possessed
by
a
woman
brought
her
an
increase
of
respect
from
her
husband
and
lessened
the
humiliation
of
her
legal
and
social
position
by
degrees
the
rich
wife
gained
the
upper
hand
and
what
the
law
would
not
give
to
her
sex
as
a
right
she
obtained
by
virtue
of
her
money

the

that
the

adage
but
we
may
hope
that
the
lives
of
all
english
brides
are
not
as
grey
as
the
skies
under
which
they
are
often
married
we
can
also
hope
that
every
bride
will
have
the
sunshine
of
joy
in
her
heart
on
her
most
weddings
now
take
place
at
or
in
consequence
of
the
extension
of
the
marriage
hours
and
this
has
in
a
great
measure
abolished
the
old
breakfast
which
was
a
rather
trying
affair
for
all
concerned
now
a
more
informal
reception
takes
place
on
the
return
from
church
with
champagne
tea
ices
and
all
sorts
of
pretty
light
refreshments
those
who
from
choice
or
force
of
circumstances
decide
upon
the
morning
for
the
ceremony
would
naturally
give
a
luncheon
but
the
smarter
section
of
society
has
spoken
in
favour
of
the
reception
i
know
of
a
capricious
couple
who
played
their
friends
a
very
shabby
trick
the
invitations
had
been
issued
for
a
wednesday
and
at
the
last
moment
they
decided
to
be
married
on
the
tuesday
morning
they
went
quietly
to
church
in
the
early
hours
left
the
town
separately
during
the
day
met
in
london
and
started
for
the
honeymoon
the
next
afternoon
their
friends
assembled
to
find
that
the
objects
of
their
congratulations
were
away
across
the
channel
this
was
a
most
serious
breach
of
etiquette
as
there
was
no
reason
for
such
rudeness
what
is
expected
of
the
bride
however
long
and
frequent
the
visits
of
the
may
have
been
to
his
sweetheart
home
tradition
decrees
that
he
must
not
sleep
under
the
same
roof
with
her
the
night
before
the
wedding
nor
is
he
supposed
to
see
her
on
the
day
till
he
meets
her
in
all
her
bridal
beauty
she
is
supposed
to
keep
in
retirement
even
from
the
members
of
her
own
household
during
the
early
part
of
the
day
but
this
is
a
matter
of
opinion
and
all
old
ideas
are
giving
way
to
more
modern
views
on
her
at
least
if
it
is
to
be
a
smart
affair
the
bride
is
handicapped
as
well
as
adorned
by
her
clothes
as
seems
to
be
the
general
lot
of
women
on
all
important
occasions
let
us
hope
that
every
care
has
been
taken
to
minimise
the
minor
anxieties
as
to
the
fit
of
her
frock
the
set
of
her
veil
the
comfort
of
shoes
and
gloves
she
must
feel
something
like
a
dressing
for
her
presentation
at
court
but
while
the
latter
is
only
making
her
entry
into
society
the
bride
is
entering
upon
a
condition
that
will
affect
her
eternally
and
one
that
ought
to
have
the
blessing
of
god
upon
it
one
would
therefore
like
the
bride
to
be
free
from
such
inconveniences
as
will
drag
her
down
mentally
let
her
be
free
to
respond
to
the
high
inspirations
and
holy
desires
that
best
become
a
woman
on
this
great
day
of
her
life
she
will
probably
be
nervous
and
small
wonder
but
she
will
be
none
the
less
attractive
for
a
little
maidenly
diffidence
the
bride
who
marches
triumphantly
through
her
wedding
does
not
show
the
best
taste
in
the
rush
and
excitement
of
the
wedding
morning
some
one
must
make
a
point
of
seeing
that
the
bride
has
proper
food
to
sustain
her
through
her
part
in
the
day
proceedings
her
appearance
will
not
be
improved
by
the
look
of
strained
weariness
that
combined
fatigue
and
exhaustion
will
bring
even
into
the
youngest
face
she
is
expected
to
look
her
best
and
to
have
her
emotions
under
control
nowadays
the
weeping
bride
is
out
of
date
she
is
expected
to
look
happy
for
is
she
not
completing
the
choice
which
she
freely
made
if
her
shoes
pinch
or
she
is
faint
from
hunger
those
expectations
can
not
be
fulfilled
the
bridesmaids
these
attendant
maidens
must
be
at
the
church
awaiting
the
bride
ready
to
follow
her
up
the
aisle
and
the
chief
one
takes
her
place
so
as
to
be
prepared
to
receive
the
gloves
and
bouquet
from
the
bride
before
the
putting
on
of
the
ring
one
or
more
of
them
will
help
the
bride
later
in
the
day
to
change
into
her
travelling
costume
and
they
can
be
of
assistance
in
countless
ways
both
to
the
hostess
and
her
guests
sometimes
however
a
bridesmaid
is
too
occupied
preparing
for
another
wedding
in
which
she
will
play
the
chief
part
to
have
much
time
for
any
one
else
the
bridegroom
though
of
the
highest
and
most
vital
importance
the
bridegroom
never
seems
quite
so
much
to
the
fore
as
the
bride
it
is
probably
a
mere
matter
of
clothes
he
is
expected
to
have
the
ring
in
readiness
to
provide
a
conveyance
to
take
himself
and
the
best
man
to
the
scene
of
the
ceremony
and
above
all
to
be
in
good
time
waiting
in
proud
anticipation
for
the
bride
arrival
he
does
not
always
look
happy
or
quite
at
his
ease
with
the
eyes
of
the
curious
congregation
upon
him
but
that
is
only
his
modesty
he
has
to
give
the
bridesmaids
a
present
generally
some
trinket
is
chosen
and
the
bride
receives
her
bouquet
from
him
sometimes
the
best
man
gives
the
bridesmaids
their
bouquets
but
it
is
generally
the
bridegroom
unless
they
are
all
related
together
the
best
man
i
have
heard
it
said
that
the
office
of
the
best
man
is
to
see
that
the
bridegroom
does
not
run
away
at
the
last
moment
we
will
hope
he
does
not
often
have
hard
work
in
that
case
he
certainly
has
to
see
that
love
does
not
make
the
bridegroom
oblivious
to
the
practical
details
of
life
he
escorts
him
to
church
and
supports
him
through
the
service
he
pays
the
fees
of
clerk
and
clergyman
and
calls
the
carriages
when
the
register
is
signed
he
is
a
very
busy
and
useful
person
if
he
does
his
duty
and
much
of
the
success
from
a
social
point
of
view
may
lie
in
his
hands
the
bride
parents
the
heaviest
burden
of
responsibility
falls
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
bride
mother
she
has
to
arrange
with
a
caterer
for
the
refreshments
unless
she
prefers
to
have
all
the
trouble
of
preparing
them
at
home
she
must
order
the
carriages
arrange
the
meals
for
guests
staying
in
the
house
and
settle
the
order
in
which
the
wedding
party
is
to
go
to
church
she
has
to
see
about
floral
decorations
wherever
they
are
wanted
and
now
flowers
play
such
an
part
in
every
festivity
she
will
be
the
one
to
whom
every
one
will
go
for
instructions
and
it
may
be
her
own
heart
will
be
very
sore
at
the
thought
of
parting
with
her
daughter
where
there
are
other
girls
they
would
naturally
take
some
portion
of
the
work
off
her
hands
but
she
is
nominal
head
of
affairs
in
most
households
the
has
to
escort
his
daughter
to
church
and
bestow
her
upon
her
husband
in
the
event
of
his
being
prevented
from
doing
this
her
mother
would
drive
with
her
and
the
relation
or
friend
who
was
acting
as
her
father
deputy
would
meet
her
at
the
church
door
the
father
pays
all
the
expenses
of
music
or
decoration
in
the
church
in
addition
to
those
of
entertainment
at
home
and
conveyances
he
will
find
the
bill
a
large
one
in
these
days
of
lavish
display
and
increased
luxury
the
idea
that
a
reception
is
much
cheaper
than
a
luncheon
is
balanced
by
the
facts
that
a
far
larger
number
of
people
can
be
included
in
the
former
and
that
champagne
can
not
be
dispensed
with
at
the
bride
house
before
the
appointed
hour
bustle
and
possible
confusion
will
reign
in
the
bride
home
the
young
people
will
take
a
pride
in
decking
the
with
flowers
the
presents
will
be
in
a
room
by
themselves
and
will
probably
have
been
arranged
the
day
before
but
there
are
always
a
hundred
little
finishing
touches
to
be
put
to
everything
the
caterer
will
if
required
supply
all
needful
glass
china
tables
and
attendance
for
the
reception
or
breakfast
everyone
should
be
dressed
in
good
time
there
will
be
belated
presents
telegrams
of
congratulation
and
all
sorts
of
minor
distractions
dressing
the
bride
in
many
cases
the
dressmaker
who
has
the
wedding
gown
comes
to
see
it
put
on
but
where
such
skilled
help
is
not
required
the
loving
hands
of
mother
sister
or
friend
would
deck
the
bride
one
thing
i
would
suggest
it
is
a
risk
to
dress
the
hair
to
suit
the
veil
rather
than
the
face
i
remember
seeing
a
bride
quite
spoiled
by
having
her
pretty
hair
dragged
up
under
her
veil
when
as
a
rule

it

almost
an
impertinence
to
tell
her
how
she
should
look
at

solemn
time
but
it
is
not
necessary
or
seemly
for
her
to
smile
and
nod
to

should
remove

a

is
bound
to
call
forth
both
retrospective
and
anticipatory
thoughts

all
unkind

should
be

by
a
common

the

the

should
see
that
all
the

have
opportunities
of
seeing
the
wedding
presents
but
it
is
not
judicious
for
visitors
at
a
big
function
to
poke
about
among
the
gifts
unless
accompanied
by
one
of
the
family
or
perhaps
a
bridesmaid
because
it
is
generally
deemed
wise
to
have
a
detective
present
on
such
an
occasion
and
he
might
misinterpret
this
friendly
interest
to
the
discomfort
of
the
prying
guests
in

a

thoughtfulness
and
tact
are
necessary
let
the
smaller
offerings
have
due
prominence
for
the
sake
of
the
kindly
thought
that
prompted
them
one
who
had
not
been
able
to
afford
a
gift
in
any
proportion
to
her
affection
would
feel
touched
by
its
occupying
a
place
of
honour

for
the

as
the
time
for
departure

will
slip
away
to
doff
her
bridal
splendour
for
her
travelling
costume
her
sister
the
favourite
bridesmaid
or
her
mother
will
doubtless
go
and
help
her
and
probably
some
of
the
real
will
be
spoken
before
she
rejoins
the
company
the
dress
will
have
been
chosen
with
reference
to
the
journey
she
is
now
undertaking
if
she
has
but
a
short
distance
to
go
it
may
be
a
picturesque
dainty
creation
but
if
she
has
hard
travelling
before
her
it
will
be
of
the
type
at

stylish
and
devoid
of
unnecessary
fallals
all
present
will
be
anxious
to
take
leave
of
the

and
to
wish
them
there
is
often
deep
sorrow
under
the
surface
of
merriment
at
such
partings
it
is
the
moment
when
young
brothers
and
frivolous
cousins
perform
impish
pranks
while
the
parents
and
maybe
the
bride
are
feeling
the
keen
pang
of
separation
paper
confetti
are
a
harmless
substitute
for
rice
which
is
not
soothing
to
receive
in
the
eye
or
ear
the
throwing
of
old
shoes
is
said
to
be
a
relic
of
the
sticks
and
stones
hurled
in
wrath
by
the
defeated
friends
of
the
bride
when
the
victorious
bridegroom
carried
her
off
as
his
prize
and
captive
the
journey
many
are
the
devices
resorted
to
by
the
newly
married
to
escape
detection
on
the
wedding
journey
some
take
old
battered
portmanteaux
i
have
heard
of
a
baby
being
borrowed
to
block
up
the
window
of
the
railway
carriage
but
matrimony
like
murder
will
out
the
bridegroom
will
naturally
do
all
in
his
power
to
make
the
journey
an
ideally
pleasant
one
and
he
will
do
well
to
remember
that
his
bride
has
had
much
more
to
strain
her
nerves
and
weary
her
than
he
has
luggage
at
any
time
it
seems
well
to
avoid
a
number
of
small
parcels
but
on
this
occasion
it
is
doubly
advisable
even
if
the
husband
and
wife
can
fix
their
minds
on
such
prosaic
things
it
is
hardly
fair
for
her
to
hang
him
round
with
her
bags
and
other
feminine
impedimenta
on
the
other
hand
if
he
has
brought
his
cycle
his
golf
clubs
his
and
his
camera
his
attention
is
bound
to
be
divided
between
the
safety
of
his
possessions
and
the
comfort
of
his
bride
where
to
go
the
destination
of
the
honeymooners
will
depend
upon
the
time
they
have
to
spare
the
money
they
can
spend
and
their
combined
tastes
there
are
a
few
practical
hints
that
may
be
given
it
is
often
said
that
travelling
is
one
of
the
best
tests
of
temper
so
let
the
woman
who
soon
feels
fretted
and
looks
jaded
or
is
physically
indisposed
by
a
long
railway
journey
take
her
honeymoon
near
home
let
no
one
who
is
not
reliably
happy
on
board
ship
attempt
to
cross
the
water
and
run
the
risk
of
ending
her
in
the
terribly
unbecoming
condition
caused
by
de
how
long
to
stay
the
modern
tendency
to
shorten
honeymoons
seems
born
of
wisdom
as
much
as
of
expediency
it
may
sound
brutal
but
undisturbed
possession
soon
palls
and
man
was
made
for
something
more
virile
than
perpetual
billing
and
cooing
the
long
honeymoon
makes
a
very
heavy
demand
upon
the
emotions
it
is
fatal
to
try
and
keep
up
a
lost
illusion
the
moment
a
man
or
woman
sees
that
the
sweetness
is
beginning
to
cloy
and
the
inaction
to
bore
it
is
time
to
return
to
everyday
life
inevitable
test
of
temperament
the
honeymoon
is
bound
to
disclose
many
hitherto
unsuspected
phases
of
character
these
revelations
will
be
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
previous
mutual
understanding
the
lover
who
has
been
may
turn
into
the
husband
who
haggles
over
his
hotel
bills
the
girl
who
has
always
looked
like
a
dainty
picture
because
there
was
some
one
to
take
care
of
her
things
may
be
careless
and
unkempt
when
there
is
no
one
but
her
husband
to
see
her
the
man
who
had
preferred
a
sandwich
in
the
woods
with
his
beloved
may
be
the
one
to
swear
at
the
waiter
if
the
made
dishes
are
not
exactly
to
his
taste
the
sweetheart
who
has
been
all
smiles
may
prove
but
a
sorry
companion
when
exposed
to
discomfort
and
show
herself
quite
unable
to
rise
cheerfully
to
an
emergency
on
the
other
hand
surprises
of
a
pleasant
nature
may
be
in
store
for
bride
and
bridegroom
unthought
of
qualities
may
be
called
into
play
deeper
feelings
may
be
aroused
and
the
full
sweetness
of
a
character
only
be
fully
revealed
in
the
sacred
privacy
of
the
honeymoon
possible
disappointments
a
modern
writer
says
how
many
ideals
are
shattered
by
the
intimacy
of
marriage
simply
because
the
antenuptial
love
has
been
based
upon
fiction
and
misunderstanding
if
only
a
man
and
a
woman
made
their
several
motives
for
marrying
quite
clear
to
one
another
and
were
not
quite
so
anxious
to
preserve
a
veneer
of
romance
up
to
the
very
altar
matrimony
would
not
be
the
terrible
iconoclast
it
too
often
is
this
is
plain
speaking
and
one
wonders
how
many
marriages
would
ever
take
place
if
this
precept
were
carried
out
it
is
true
that
much
has
to
be
revealed
after
marriage
the
lover
has
only
seen
his
sweetheart
when
she
has
placed
herself
on
view
so
to
speak
they
were
both
kept
in
check
by
the
uncertainty
of
their
position
the
husband
sees
his
wife
under
all
circumstances
in
mentally
trying
moments
in
physically
unbecoming
situations
in
fact
she
has
to
appear
before
him
with
her
hair
out
of
curl
actually
and
metaphorically
to
use
a
homely
illustration
disillusion
passing
or
permanent
the
mental
relations
between
husband
and
wife
must
necessarily
differ
from
those
between
lovers
and
the
more
honest
and
sincere
they
have
been
during
their
courtship
the
less
painful
will
be
the
awakening
after
marriage
where
there
is
both
love
and
trust
coupled
with
common
sense
a
little
humour
and
a
broad
view
of
life
the
disillusion
should
only
be
a
passing
cloud
that
makes
the
sunshine
all
the
brighter
for
its
temporary
shade
where
there
has
been
conscious
or
even
involuntary
deception
an
unreal
position
or
exaggerated
idealisation
on
either
side
the
pain
of
disillusion
will
be
poignant
and
its
effect
permanent
things
can
be
sorrowfully
and
bravely
patched
up
for
mere
outward
use
but
there
will
be
a
smart
under
the
smile
and
a
blank
in
the
life
that
should
have
been
so
full
whatever
mental
crisis
may
follow
marriage
the
two
who
suffer
for
one
seldom
suffers
alone
will
do
well
to
keep
their
own
counsel
if
the
silence
is
too
great
a
strain
it
is
wiser
though
perhaps
not
so
natural
to
seek
help
from
some
trusted
friend
unconnected
by
kinship
with
either
family
relations
can
not
take
an
unprejudiced
view
of
the
case
they
are
bound
to
be
biassed
in
favour
of
their
own
and
even
if
family
jars
are
not
openly
discussed
the
leaven
works
and
its
effect
is
soon
perceptible

a

into
the
practical
housekeeping
wedding
calls
the
couple
at
home
and
in
the
return
home
it
is
the
unanimous
and
unqualified
opinion
of
those
who
know
that
the
first
year
of
married
life
practically
answers
the
question
is
marriage
a
failure
the
bride
who
can
emerge
triumphantly
from
this
searching
ordeal
will
hold
her
own
for
the
rest
of
her
career
as
a
wife
the
girl
or
woman
has
everything
to
try
her
mettle
the
end
of
the
honeymoon
sees
the
beginning
of
her
real
work
she
has
won
her
husband
she
has
charmed
and
satisfied
him
in
the
hours
of
love
in
idleness
she
has
now
to
keep
him
true
to
his
allegiance
through
the
dull
prosaic
days
of
ordinary
humdrum
life
for
the
husband
the
change
is
not
nearly
so
great
he
has
his
usual
daily
avocations
to
follow
his
business
or
professional
duties
have
undergone
no
alteration
we
will
hope
the
wedded
pair
have
a
nice
cosy
home
awaiting
their
return
if
the
honeymoon
has
been
short
the
bulk
of
the
preparations
will
have
been
made
before
the
wedding
and
a
mother
or
sister
will
have
put
the
finishing
touches
during
the
bride
absence
but
no
one
should
be
awaiting
them
in
their
new
home
except
the
servants
they
have
engaged
it
may
be
that
there
is
a
visit
to
be
paid
to
relations
before
settling
into
the
new
home
and
this
will
be
a
little
trying
those
who
love
them
and
who
watch
them
start
on
their
wedding
journey
will
eagerly
scan
their
features
for
some
sign
to
indicate
how
things
have
gone
with
them
in
this
important
interval
a
happy
heart
need
shun
no
such
scrutiny
but
where
the
slightest
wound
is
hidden
under
smiles
the
loving
solicitude
will
give
pain
a
plunge
into
the
practical
whatever
the
nature
of
the
new
home
may
be
whether
mansion
or
cottage
town
flat
or
suburban
villa
even
if
it
be
but
the
temporary
of
furnished
rooms
the
wife
will
do
well
to
begin
by
studying
her
husband
comfort
and
finding
out
any
special
likes
and
dislikes
that
may
not
as
yet
have
come
under
her
notice
he
for
his
part
must
not
expect
too
much
and
should
try
not
to
make
her
painfully
conscious
of
her
shortcomings
he
might
also
reflect
with
advantage
when
things
are
not
to
his
taste
that
he
has
himself
to
thank
for
a
good
deal
he
chose
his
wife
for
her
youth
her
beauty
her
charm
or
her
money
it
may
be
and
he
then
asked
for
no
other
qualification
he
took
up
all
her
thoughts
and
her
spare
time
during
their
engagement
and
all
he
asked
was
that
she
should
look
nice
and
let
him
make
love
to
her
she
was
purely
ornamental
in
those
days
and
he
was
content
to
have
her
so
once
marriage
is
over
he
expects
her
to
develop
exactly
those
domestic
gifts
that
shall
best
minister
to
his
comfort
and
this
can
not
be
done
in
a
day
housekeeping
apart
from
the
strangeness
of
her
position
her
probable
isolation
from
all
familiar
faces
her
mingled
sense
of
freedom
and
responsibility
the
young
wife
has
much
to
contend
with
housekeeping
comes
more
easily
to
some
women
than
to
others
and
the
one
who
has
a
domestic
gift
scores
a
big
point
in
starting
married
life
the
girl
who
has
had
no
previous
training
or
practical
experience
will
spend
many
a
bitter
moment
face
to
face
with
her
own
utter
incompetence
the
servant
question
alone
is
enough
for
most
people
the
young
maid
knows
her
new
mistress
is
but
a
novice
the
experienced
cook
regards
her
either
from
a
motherly
point
of
view
or
in
the
light
of
lawful
prey
she
has
however
to
maintain
her
dignity
in
the
face
of
all
this
she
knows
her
ignorance
will
be
detected
and
possibly
laughed
at
behind
her
back
but
she
must
not
compromise
the
position
in
which
her
husband
has
placed
her
by
undue
familiarity
or
undignified
relations
with
those
over
whom
she
is
to
preside
by
this
it
is
not
meant
that
a
mistress
should
be
afraid
of
being
civil
and
even
friendly
with
her
maids
but
she
must
discern
nicely
between
that
which
breeds
contempt
and
that
which
adds
affection
to
respect
money
matters
many
girls
have
had
no
money
to
manage
beyond
the
spending
of
a
dress
allowance
with
an
indulgent
parent
always
ready
to
make
up
the
deficit
it
would
be
well
for
every
mother
to
give
the
housekeeping
accounts
into
the
hands
of
her
engaged
daughter
for
at
least
a
month
before
she
marries
she
will
not
master
the
subject
but
she
will
acquire
some
idea
of
the
just
prices
of
household
commodities
and
the
quantities
that
should
be
ordered
the
bride
who
suggested
the
leg
of
beef
for
a
change
is
happily
fictional
but
it
is
to
be
feared
that
many
do
not
much
exceed
her
in
knowledge
some
men
give
their
wives
a
regular
weekly
allowance
for
domestic
expenses
and
this
seems
a
fair
way
to
do
things
others
believe
in
paying
everything
by
cheque
and
thus
keep
all
the
money
in
their
own
hands
provided
the
husband
is
pleasant
when
the
cheques
are
drawn
out
the
wife
is
saved
a
great
deal
of
trouble
but
the
man
who
swears
over
the
monthly
bill
and
wants
an
account
of
every
pound
of
meat
consumed
in
that
time
creates
a
perpetual
burden
for
his
luckless
partner
the
early
mismanagement
of
household
expenses
is
fraught
with
sorrow
to
the
wife
and
to
the
husband
who
begins
to
ask
anxiously
could
i
really
afford
to
marry
whatever
the
precise
nature
of
the
arrangement
may
be
there
should
be
a
clear
understanding
as
to
how
the
expenses
are
to
be
divided
supposing
the
wife
has
her
own
income
or
an
allowance
from
her
husband
she
ought
to
know
exactly
what
that
sum
is
expected
to
cover
she
is
also
entitled
to
a
definite
knowledge
as
to
the
extent
of
his
income
many
a
tragedy
might
have
been
averted
if
the
wife
had
been
taken
earlier
into
the
husband
confidence
wedding
calls
there
is
much
diversity
of
opinion
as
to
how
the
bride
is
to
make
her
known
to
her
friends
the
fashion
of
sending
is
pronounced
out
of
date
and
they
are
only
now
tolerated
when
enclosed
with
to
old
friends
it
is
no
longer
necessary
for
the
bride
to
sit
at
home
in
expectant
and
solitary
grandeur
waiting
for
the
callers
to
make
their
appearance
she
is
free
to
go
out
and
about
as
she
pleases
unless
of
course
she
has
fixed
any
date
upon
which
to
receive
friends
she
must
be
careful
to
return
all
the
calls
made
upon
her
in
due
time
and
should
note
the
at
home
days
and
addresses
of
her
new
acquaintances
the
simplest
way
is
to
let
the
date
of
return
filter
out
through
friends
and
if
any
one
is
really
anxious
to
call
she
will
find
out
when
to
do
so
in
the
suburbs
and
in
country
towns
the
bride
may
quite
well
give
an
at
home
to
the
friends
who
gave
her
presents
and
to
those
who
were
at
her
wedding
without
waiting
for
them
to
call
upon
her
the
invitations
would
be
sent
out
in
the
wife
name
only
but
her
husband
would
put
in
an
appearance
if
possible
the
bride
would
receive
her
friends
in
one
of
her
dainty
new
frocks
and
though
there
would
be
no
formal
display
of
presents
those
who
had
given
her
pretty
things
would
be
pleased
to
see
them
put
to
their
appointed
uses
it
is
not
a
bride
place
to
start
an
acquaintance
with
older
married
people
nor
is
she
expected
to
entertain
upon
a
large
scale
during
the
early
part
of
her
married
life
in
certain
cases
notably
those
of
professional
men
the
social
success
of
the
young
wife
may
materially
affect
the
financial
position
of
her
husband
i
knew
of
a
doctor
bride
who
gave
great
offence
to
his
patients
by
omitting
to
return
her
wedding
calls
until
after
her
first
child
was
born
the
couple
at
home
loneliness
is
one
of
the
bride
trials
she
is
alone
the
greater
part
of
the
day
her
things
are
all
new
and
do
not
require
much
attention
in
the
way
of
mending
or
altering
her
household
is
but
small
and
once
she
has
had
her
morning
interview
with
the
cook
there
is
not
much
for
her
to
do
the
novelty
of
her
position
makes
her
restless
and
averse
to
going
on
with
the
pursuits
that
have
been
interrupted
by
her
marriage
the
old
familiar
home
life
is
exchanged
for
solitary
sway
and
she
does
not
always
know
how
to
fill
up
the
long
hours
she
gets
nervous
and
is
sometimes
driven
out
of
her
new
home
in
search
of
excitement
the
woman
who
marries
on
a
small
income
and
has
plenty
of
work
to
do
is
not
so
liable
to
this
unfortunate
development
the
husband
should
be
prepared
for
the
effect
of
this
uprooting
on
his
young
wife
he
must
not
grudge
her
the
little
diversions
that
will
help
to
pass
the
time
while
he
is
away
a
woman
with
tact
will
choose
the
right
moment
for
unburdening
her
mind
of
domestic
woes
it
is
generally
considered
a
wise
plan
to
give
a
man
a
good
dinner
before
you
tell
him
anything
unpleasant
the
less
she
tells
him
of
her
petty
worries
the
better
a
wife
will
get
on
and
the
more
her
husband
will
admire
her
real
troubles
and
grave
anxieties
should
always
be
shared
and
both
authority
and
responsibility
should
be
divided
in
a
household
if
things
are
to
run
smoothly
it
will
be
well
for
the
young
wife
if
she
can
feel
the
matrimonial
ground
firmly
beneath
her
feet
before
she
is
called
upon
to
bear
the
additional
anxieties
and
physical
trials
of
approaching
motherhood
in
society
the
bride
is
the
honoured
guest
at
any
party
given
on
her
account
she
would
naturally
appear
in
white
and
if
it
were
a
grand
affair
she
might
don
a
modified
edition
of
the
wedding
gown
i
know
a
youthful
bride
who
having
been
married
in
a
travelling
dress
ordered
a
white
satin
frock
at
her
husband
expense
in
which
to
make
her
social
the
average
couple
are
not
the
most
entertaining
companions
their
own
little
world
is
too
absorbing
for
them
to
take
much
interest
in
the
trifles
outside
it
but
it
is
beautiful
to
see
their
happiness
sometimes
they
are
tiresome
the
bride
is
the
chief
offender
she
quotes
her
adolphus
as
the
and
dilates
on
her
own
recent
domestic
discoveries
as
if
they
were
what
civilised
humanity
had
been
waiting
for
through
dark
ages
of
perplexity
her
superior
attitude
towards
unmarried
friends
not
unfrequently
leads
to
friction
we
must
have
patience
with
her
for
she
is
learning
a
great
deal
and
has
not
yet
had
time
to
sort
it
out
into
proper
proportions

marriages
differences
of
colour

and
religion
scotch
marriages
marriage
of
minors
and
wards
in
mixed
marriages
love
overleaps
all
barriers
and
it
is
of
but
little
use
to
try
and
bind
it
marriage
however
is
another
thing
and
can
be
prevented
even
where
love
exists
how
far
it
is
right
or
advisable
to
do
so
must
be
a
matter
of
individual
judgment
decided
by
the
facts
of
each
separate
case
to
take
an
instance
there
is
a
very
strong
feeling
especially
among
medical
men
against
the
marriage
of
cousins
now
love
deep
and
true
may
exist
between
two
cousins
but
seeing
the
physical
deterioration
that
comes
from
the
intermarrying
of
members
of
one
family
it
may
be
a
plain
duty
to
unborn
generations
for
these
two
to
abstain
from
marriage
with
each
other
where
there
is
any
hereditary
disease
of
mind
or
body
it
is
little
short
of
criminal
to
contract
such
a
union
in
the
matter
of
namely
those
between
men
and
women
differing
from
each
other
in
colour
nationality
or
religion
it
is
generally
thought
that
they
are
fraught
with
grave
risks
the
question
of
colour
this
does
not
affect
us
here
in
england
as
much
as
it
does
in
india
and
those
parts
of
the
empire
where
there
is
a
coloured
native
population
to
those
who
have
lived
among
it
the
question
is
one
of
burning
importance
we
can
not
go
into
it
here
but
seeing
that
these
marriages
do
take
place
even
in
england
a
word
of
warning
may
not
be
amiss
women
who
are
fascinated
by
coloured
men
would
do
well
to
note
that
there
is
not
a
white
man
good
bad
or
indifferent
who
does
not
abhor
the
idea
of
a
white
woman
marrying
a
coloured
man
this
is
not
the
outcome
of
jealousy
nor
yet
of
ignorance
for
the
more
the
european
has
travelled
the
more
rooted
is
his
aversion
to
such
unions
he
knows
as
man
with
man
what
the
real
mental
attitude
of
those
dusky
gentlemen
is
towards
women
he
knows
what
lies
behind
the
courtly
manner
the
nameless
grace
and
sensuous
charm
of
these
impassioned
lovers
no
woman
can
know
this
till
after
marriage
and
then
the
knowledge
does
not
do
her
much
good
let
any
woman
who
contemplates
a
marriage
with
a
coloured
man
no
matter
how
high
his
caste
may
be
take
counsel
with
some
man
who
has
lived
among
the
dark
races
and
who
can
not
possibly
be
suspected
of
jealousy
and
she
will
learn
that
which
may
save
her
from
an
infinity
of
suffering
different
nationalities
among
europeans
intermarriage
is
fairly
frequent
and
may
turn
out
well
no
doubt
it
is
a
success
in
many
cases
but
where
it
is
i
think
it
will
be
found
that
either
the
man
has
become
cosmopolitan
in
his
ideas
or
the
woman
has
lived
long
enough
abroad
to
fit
in
with
continental
modes
of
life
the
english
girl
who
has
been
educated
in
a
french
convent
will
not
have
the
same
difficulty
in
pleasing
a
french
husband
or
adapting
herself
to
his
ways
as
the
girl
who
meets
monsieur
blanc
on
her
first
visit
to
the
continent
without
a
fairly
wide
knowledge
of
the
home
life
to
which
marriage
with
a
foreigner
will
lead
an
english
scotch
or
irish
girl
is
running
a
great
risk
by
taking
such
a
final
step
as
matrimony
for
in
no
other
country
in
europe
have
women
quite
the
same
position
as
in
the
british
isles
the
more
restricted
the
mental
horizon
of
the
one
may
be
the
less
likelihood
is
there
of
perfect
sympathy
between
husband
and
wife
the
necessary
formalities
where
such
a
marriage
has
been
decided
upon
there
are
many
preliminary
regulations
to
be
observed
as
my
legal
friend
remarks
a
strict
observance
of
the
marriage
laws
of
foreign
countries
where
one
of
the
parties
to
a
marriage
is
english
and
it
takes
place
in
england
is
most
necessary
or
a
person
may
find
herself
or
himself
married
in
england
but
legally
repudiated
abroad
in
france
the
consent
of
parents
is
required
up
to
the
age
of
and
if
refused
what
are
called
three
respectful
summonses
are
to
be
made
if
consent
be
still
withheld
the
party
can
marry
legally
there
was
a
case
recently
in
the
english
papers
of
a
marriage
between
two
french
people
being
annulled
because
the
ceremony
had
been
performed
in
england
without
the
proper
formalities
having
been
observed
in
france
in
germany
the
fact
of
the
betrothal
and
intention
to
marry
must
be
advertised
in
newspapers
circulating
in
the
district
or
districts
in
which
the
parties
reside
and
if
one
of
them
resides
in
england
then
in
an
english
newspaper
in
germany
notice
has
also
to
be
given
to
the
or
some
like
official
any
marriage
that
is
legal
in
the
country
where
it
is
contracted
is
valid
in
switzerland
an
englishwoman
marrying
an
italian
may
be
married
in
england
according
to
the
rites
of
her
own
church
but
a
copy
of
the
marriage
certificate
must
be
sent
to
the
nearest
italian
consul
who
forwards
it
to
the
authorities
of
the
man
native
town
or
place
of
residence
there
should
be
no
delay
in
doing
this
as
no
marriage
is
legal
in
italy
if
not
registered
within
three
months
of
its
celebration
there
have
been
so
many
sad
results
from
irregular
mixed
marriages
that
at
the
february
meeting
of
the
lower
house
of
convocation
at
york
a
resolution
was
moved
in
view
of
the
grave
scandals
arising
in
respect
to
marriages
between
english
and
foreign
subjects
asking
the
upper
house
to
consider
the
desirability
of
issuing
an
order
to
the
beneficed
clergy
and
the
diocesan
registrars
requiring
that
when
a
foreigner
gives
notice
of
his
intention
to
be
married
to
an
english
subject
the
marriage
should
not
be
solemnised
till
a
consular
certificate
was
produced
that
the
laws
of
the
foreign
country
had
been
complied
with
british
subjects
living
abroad
no
british
subject
especially
a
woman
should
agree
to
any
form
of
marriage
without
having
first
applied
to
the
british
consul
of
the
district
or
to
the
embassy
if
there
is
one
for
full
particulars
and
instructions
for
the
contracting
of
a
legal
marriage
in
a
foreign
country
under
the
marriage
act
an
englishwoman
takes
the
nationality
of
the
man
she
marries
a
marriage
that
would
be
illegal
in
england
is
unaffected
by
any
ceremony
performed
in
the
presence
of
authorised
persons
abroad
should
the
parties
return
to
this
country
for
instance
a
man
who
wishes
to
marry
his
deceased
wife
sister
can
go
to
a
country
where
such
a
marriage
is
legal
and
be
married
but
if
the
couple
return
to
england
they
are
not
man
and
wife
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
different
religious
persuasions
where
there
is
a
difference
of
religious
faith
and
practice
between
the
man
and
woman
there
will
not
only
be
the
marriage
ceremony
to
arrange
but
there
should
be
a
clear
written
agreement
as
to
which
faith
any
children
that
may
be
born
are
to
be
reared
in
the
roman
church
does
not
recognise
marriage
except
when
solemnised
by
her
own
priests
but
if
one
of
the
parties
is
not
a
romanist
the
ceremony
may
be
afterwards
gone
through
in
an
english
church
or
nonconformist
chapel
a
jew
in
england
can
be
married
by
a
registrar
but
probably
the
majority
of
jews
in
england
are
married
in
a
synagogue
in
which
case
a
registrar
is
in
attendance
any
one
who
marries
a
romanist
should
bear
in
mind
that
the
dearest
aim
of
every
faithful
member
of
their
church
is
to
bring
others
into
the
fold
many
nonconformists
are
willing
and
even
anxious
to
be
married
in
the
parish
church
of
their

etiquette
of
marriage
quaint
customs
and
strange
continental
weddings
many
of
the
national
picturesque
customs
have
disappeared
from
the
weddings
of
the
townspeople
and
the
more
educated
classes
on
the
continent
but
many
distinctive
points
of
etiquette
still
remain
and
we
shall
find
that
in
matters
of
detail
there
is
much
that
differs
from
our
english
ways
in
it
is
impossible
for
young
people
to
marry
without
the
consent
of
their
parents
or
legal
guardians
and
unless
certain
prescribed
forms
are
gone
through
the
marriage
will
be
null
and
void
so
many
certificates
of
birth
parentage
have
to
be
produced
that
it
is
said
the
working
classes
can
neither
afford
the
time
nor
the
money
necessary
for
a
legal
marriage
so
many
of
them
do
without
it
the
husband
is
the
lord
and
master
his
wife
property
passes
into
his
keeping
and
is
at
his
absolute
disposal
he
may
compel
her
to
work
and
even
if
the
pair
be
divorced
he
still
retains
her
money
as
german
girls
are
brought
up
to
expect
this
it
does
not
strike
them
as
any
hardship
and
most
of
them
are
quite
happy
to
be
under
the
sway
of
their
liege
lords
the
chief
festivity
of
a
german
wedding
is
the
a
somewhat
hilarious
party
given
the
night
before
the
young
friends
of
the
bride
enact
charades
or
give
living
pictures
illustrative
of
the
chief
events
in
her
childhood
and
youth
there
is
much
merriment
and
i
believe
the
breaking
of
crockery
has
a
part
in
the
proceedings
the
bridesmaids
are
accompanied
by
an
equal
number
of
young
men
called
the
bridal
wreath
is
always
of
myrtle
not
orange
blossom
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
exchange
rings
customs
vary
according
to
social
station
and
locality
at
a
south
german
peasant
wedding
there
is
wild
rejoicing
and
much
ceremony
the
guests
are
invited
by
a
messenger
who
draws
devices
on
the
doorsteps
of
those
he
has
to
summon
to
the
feast
there
is
music
and
dancing
processions
are
formed
to
and
from
the
church
the
bride
is
hailed
with
flowers
and
all
sorts
of
emblematical
offerings
are
taken
to
church
the
bridegroom
stuffs
his
pockets
with
samples
of
what
he
hopes
will
constitute
his
worldly
wealth
if
he
never
looks
back
between
the
house
and
the
altar
the
bride
knows
that
he
will
never
want
a
second
wife
for
those
who
have
the
leisure
and
opportunity
to
study
these
peasant
marriages
a
curious
compound
of
sentiment
superstition
and
practical
common
sense
will
present
itself
in
norway
the
bride
who
has
preserved
her
maiden
state
untarnished
it
is
not
necessarily
expected
of
her
is
crowned
with
a
high
glittering
crown
inlaid
with
gems
which
is
the
property
of
the
church
and
can
be
hired
for
five
dollars
special
music
is
also
performed
in
her
honour
by
the
rustic
musicians
wedding
festivities
are
marked
by
unbounded
hospitality
there
is
food
and
drink
for
all
when
the
procession
is
formed
the
bride
walks
last
clad
in
a
gorgeous
costume
which
also
may
be
hired
there
are
both
bridesmaids
and
the
latter
being
married
women
who
lend
their
moral
support
to
the
bride
the
couple
kneel
in
the
church
under
a
sort
of
canopy
made
out
of
shawls
and
scarves
held
up
by
the
bridesmaids
after
the
ceremony
an
amount
of
eating
drinking
and
dancing
go
on
that
we
can
hardly
imagine
the
bridegroom
has
a
last
sort
of
romp
with
his
bachelor
friends
and
has
to
be
wrested
from
them
by
the
married
men
the
bride
dances
off
her
crown
is
then
blindfolded
and
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
her
bridesmaids
and
places
her
crown
upon
the
head
of
one
of
them
who
is
claimed
as
the
next
bride
before
the
cake
is
cut
each
friend
lays
a
coin
upon
it
and
toasts
are
drunk
with
enthusiasm
in
some
provinces
the
bride
has
to
run
away
and
hide
the
day
after
the
wedding
a
grand
search
is
then
made
and
she
is
carried
home
with
much
ado
this
practice
still
prevails
among
some
of
the
native
african
tribes
and
the
aborigines
of
australia
in
brittany
the
bridegroom
pretends
to
capture
his
bride
he
makes
a
mock
assault
upon
her
house
which
is
carefully
closed
with
locks
and
bolts
against
him
the
besieging
party
take
bagpipes
to
while
away
the
time
much
parleying
goes
on
and
every
female
member
of
the
bride
family
is
offered
to
the
bridegroom
by
one
of
her
male
relations
who
is
the
chosen
tormentor
when
she
finally
does
appear
the
pair
exchange
sprigs
of
myrtle
or
orange
blossom
and
there
is
a
dance
before
the
party
starts
for
the
church
they
all
kneel
in
prayer
and
the
bride
takes
a
touching
farewell
of
her
parents
feasting
and
revelry
finish
up
the
day
in
italy
the
bride
becomes
entirely
one
of
her
husband
family
and
his
mother
is
before
the
marriage
the
couple
accompanied
by
three
witnesses
must
go
before
the
appointed
authorities
and
a
document
is
drawn
up
stating
that
they
wish
to
marry
the
witnesses
sign
this
paper
to
show
that
there
is
no
impediment
to
the
marriage
the
document
is
then
posted
up
outside
a
stated
public
building
for
the
inspection
of
the
if
no
one
makes
any
objection
before
the
end
of
a
fortnight
the
couple
may
then
make
a
legal
civil
contract
and
nothing
more
is
required
this
arrangement
was
made
to
check
the
power
of
the
priests
who
manipulated
marriages
much
to
their
own
fancy
under
the
papal
government
a
youth
must
be
eighteen
and
a
girl
sixteen
before
they
can
marry
there
are
many
superstitions
about
the
lucky
and
unlucky
days
for
marriages
sunday
is
the
favoured
day
there
are
hardly
ever
any
bridesmaids
at
an
italian
wedding
as
girls
are
not
supposed
to
be
present
on
such
occasions
so
the
married
women
accompany
the
bride
in
russia
no
man
under
thirty
nor
woman
under
may
marry
without
the
consent
of
parents
but
in
the
event
of
unreasonable
opposition
an
appeal
may
be
made
to
the
law
both
bride
and
bridegroom
must
give
costly
presents
to
the
church
the
man
comes
to
claim
his
bride
from
her
parents
and
she
kneels
before
them
to
ask
pardon
for
all
she
may
have
done
to
vex
or
grieve
them
they
raise
her
with
a
kiss
of
forgiveness
and
give
her
bread
and
salt
in
token
that
they
will
never
let
her
want
when
she
leaves
her
old
home
the
door
is
left
open
as
a
sign
that
she
may
always
return
to
it
rich
brides
wear
nothing
but
white
and
orange
blossom
but
pale
blue
and
a
coronet
of
silver
ribbon
are
more
in
accordance
with
the
national
custom
the
religious
ceremony
has
all
the
ritual
and
grandeur
of
the
greek
church
the
bride
has
to
prostrate
herself
before
her
husband
in
token
of
entire
submission
the
best
man
attends
the
bride
not
the
bridegroom
and
is
chosen
by
her
seven
in
the
evening
is
the
time
for
russian
weddings
to
begin
mostly
couples
live
with
the
husband
family
who
greet
them
on
their
return
from
church
with
bread
and
salt
a
dance
follows
during
which
the
bride
has
to
change
her
dress
as
many
times
as
she
has
different
costumes
in
her
trousseau
the
supper
is
served
at
daybreak
after
which
the
guests
depart
in
russia
the
wife
name
is
always
a
little
different
from
that
of
her
husband
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
family
name
when
borne
by
a
male
is
a
substantive
and
can
be
used
alone
while
in
a
case
it
is
only
an
adjective
which
requires
completion
to
give
it
full
meaning
in
sweden
a
rainy
day
is
considered
lucky
for
a
marriage
as
it
foretells
wealth
there
is
barbaric
feasting
at
the
wedding
and
departing
guests
are
given
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
a
huge
ring
of
wheaten
bread
with
which
to
treat
those
they
meet
on
their
way
home
the
bride
is
dressed
by
her
particular
friend
or
by
the
pastor
wife
and
wears
a
black
beribboned
gown
ornamented
with
mock
gems
tinsel
and
artificial
flowers
she
has
a
myrtle
wreath
or
a
crown
like
her
norwegian
sister
her
shoes
have
some
symbolical
reference
to
possible
motherhood
in
the
left
one
her
father
places
a
silver
coin
while
her
mother
puts
gold
in
the
right
shoe
these
represent
the
necessaries
and
luxuries
with
which
they
hope
she
will
be
provided
on
her
return
from
church
her
mother
places
a
sweetmeat
in
her
mouth
to
make
her
gentle
of
speech
in
spain
the
bride
always
retains
her
maiden
name
attached
to
that
of
her
husband
and
both
must
be
used
together
flowers
form
a
great
feature
of
spanish
marriages
and
in
each
district
blossoms
have
special
significance
in
valentia
the
ceremony
takes
place
at
night
and
there
is
a
mock
marriage
by
capture
all
the
guests
must
leave
by
in
catalonia
only
the
nearest
relations
of
the
pair
are
allowed
to
attend
the
service
but
many
guests
are
asked
to
the
house
and
each
must
bring
a
gift
it
is
an
insult
to
refuse
an
invitation
of
this
kind
the
guests
are
divided
according
to
sex
and
when
the
bridegroom
is
tired
of
the
men
he
goes
and
throws
sweets
at
the
ladies
exclusive
of
his
wife
then
dancing
follows
the
bride
father
gives
his
daughter
her
house
furniture
and
trousseau
while
the
guests
are
supposed
to
supply
her
dowry
in
andalusia
no
ring
is
used
but
every
married
woman
wears
flowers
in
her
hair
over
the
right
ear
as
a
mark
of
her
matronly
dignity
in
hungary
a
society
has
been
formed
in
south
hungary
to
enable
the
bride
to
have
her
name
joined
with
that
of
her
husband
and
it
may
be
noted
in
passing
that
in
germany
and
austria
the
wife
takes
the
title
as
well
as
the
name
of
the
man
she
marries
she
is
braun
or
sanitary
inspector
meyer
mrs
colonel
schmidt
and
so
on
the
day
before
a
marriage
in
hungary
there
is
a
grand
display
of
the
presents
and
trousseau
and
the

lasts
for

with

may
have
a

with
and
a
kiss
from
the

for
which
payment
is
made
in
small
coins
in
switzerland
as
in
france
the
civil
marriage
must
precede
the
religious

a
widow
or
a
woman
separated
from

may
not
marry
again
till
at
least
ten
months
have
elapsed
since
the
death
or

at
a

there
is
often
a
mistress
of
the
ceremonies
who
distributes
red
and
blue
handkerchiefs
among
the
guests
in
return
for
which
she
receives
money
for
the

the
sum
thus
collected
is

vary
according
to
the

and
the

the

takes
place
in

the

ring
does
duty
both
for

and

from

to

the

at
the

ceremony
in
france
women
of
the
upper
and
middle
classes
often
wear

they
seem
to
regard
it
as
a
badge
of
servitude
and
leave
it
to
their
humbler
sisters
in
a
roman
catholic
french
church
the
bride
is
attended
by
one
bridesmaid
and
a
groomsman
who
after
the
service
make
a
collection
from
the
guests
and
hand
it
over
to
the

the
two
perform
this
act
very
gracefully
the

turns
one

upwards
and
the

for
the
wedding
dress
thinks
the
careful
woman
the
bride
wears
a
costume
similar
to
that
worn
in
england
but
the
bridesmaid
is
in
more
ordinary
afternoon
dress
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
guests
who
do
not
assume
a
distinctively
bridal
appearance
sometimes
the
civil
marriage
takes
place
immediately
before
the
religious
one
or
it
may
be
performed
on

preceding
day
the
protestant

and
all
are

as

as
they
are

so
why
stain
the
start
of
their
wedded
life
by
deception
and
falsehood
the
seeds
of
distrust
and
contempt
may
thus
be
sown
in
hearts
where
there
should
be
mutual
love
and
trust
and
then
bitter
fruits
will
spring
up
when
once
the
novelty
is
over

there
need
be
no
secret
marriages
in
this
empire
a
private
marriage
celebrated
in
the
presence
of
only
a
few
chosen
friends
is
what
many
may
prefer
and
desire
but
considering
the
inevitable
slur
contained
in

words

they

that
to

the

the
great
question
in
the
remarriage
of
parents
with
children
under
age
is
the
welfare
of
those
children
and
the
choice
of
husband
or
wife
especially
the
latter
should
be
largely
influenced
by
this
consideration

is
not

in

disfavour
as
the
probably
because

relations
with
the
young
people
are
not
so
intimate
the
widow
a
genial
student
of
womankind
says
a
little
widow
is
a
dangerous
thing
she
knows
not
only
her
own
sex
but
the
other
too
and
knowledge
is
power
she
is
experienced
accessible
and
free
and
withal
fatally
fascinating
there
is
a
great
charm
in
loving
a
woman
who
is
versed
in
the
lore
of
love
and
is
practised
in
all
the
tricks
of
it
her
courtship
is
more
untrammelled
than
that
of
a
single
woman
her
position
is
all
in
her
favour
if
she
is
very
young
she
will
probably
have
a
companion
or
live
with
some
relative
if
she
has
small
children
they
can

a
very
convenient

a
lover
comes
to
woo
she
does
not
always
have
a

she
may
prefer

it
is
also
a
matter
of
taste
whether
she
retain

its
place
or
not
if
she
decides
to
banish

the

to

home

she
and
her
husband
may
decide
to
live
in

he
will
need
to
exercise
tact
in
taking
up
his
position
as
master
of
a
household
that
has
hitherto
gone
on
quite
well
without
him
an
entire
change
of
servants
would
probably
be
advisable
if
not
inevitable
the
wife
would
be
careful
to
give
him
his
full
dignity
and
not
to
let
it
appear
that
he
was
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
pensioner
on
her
bounty
the
widower
a
man
whose
wife
dies
leaving
him
with
young
children
or
even
one
baby
is
in
a
most
pathetic
position
and
the
best
thing
he
can
do
is
to
find
some
nice
woman
to
console
him
and
mother
the
little
ones
it
is
a
pity
that
the
two
qualifications
can
not
always
go
together
it
is
rather
risky
for
a
sister
or
a
niece
to
regard
the
home
offered
her
by
a
widowed
brother
or
uncle
as
a
permanency
men
who
are
apparently
satisfied
with
existing
arrangements
have
a
way
of
springing
surprises
upon
their
devoted
womenfolk
and
when
the
new
wife
appears
the
sister
or
niece
who
has
tided
him
over
the
worst
part
of
his
life
must
find
a
home
elsewhere
of
course
the
man
is
quite
within
his
rights
but
i
would
warn
those
who
may
be
living
in
a
fool
paradise
the
widower
with
a
house
or
estate
would
naturally
consult
the
future
mistress
of
it
about
any
alterations
he
proposed
making
before
his
marriage
on
her
visits
of
inspection
she
would
either
be
chaperoned
by
her
mother
or
some
married
relation
but
if
more
convenient
he
would
ask
a
lady
friend
to
come
and
meet
her
if
he
had
a
daughter
she
would
continue
to
preside
over
his
household
till
after
his
marriage
it
is
not
fair
for
a
man
to
take
a
second
wife
without
giving
any
previous
intimation
to
his
adult
sons
and
daughters
who
may
still
be
making
their
home
with
him
the
installation
of
a
girl
over
youths
of
her
own
age
places
them
all
in
rather
a
difficult
position
and
has
the
possible
making
of
a
tragedy
in
it
the
widower
who
marries
a
spinster
may
go
through
all
the
glories
of
a
smart
wedding
for
a
second
or
third
time
if
he
likes
seeing
that
it
is
the
condition
of
the
bride
that
decides
such
matters
comparison
with
the
predecessor
those
who
play
the
role
of
no
must
make
up
their
minds
to
be
compared
in
thought
if
not
in
word
involuntarily
if
not
intentionally
with
no
and
the
process
need
not
necessarily
be
painful
unless
there
has
been
some
distressing
or
tragic
element
in
the
first
marriage
why
should
the
memory
of
the
dead
be
banished
except
by
jealousy
or
inconstancy
it
is
not
generous
of
no
to
try
and
sweep
away
all
traces
of
the
predecessor
the
man
or
woman
who
will
lightly
abandon
all
the
memories
of
the
partner
of
youth
is
not
so
calculated
to
make
an
ideal
companion
for

age
as
the

who
cherishes
a
tender
regard

chapter
xxi
for

concluding
marrying
for
love
in
spite
of
all
that
the
cynics
and
pessimists
may
say
love
should
be
the
lord
of
marriage
how
sweet
the
mutual
yoke
of
man
and
wife
when
holy
fires
maintain
love
heavenly

true
happiness
can
not
exist
without
it
however
great
the
wealth
or
exalted
the
position
of
the
married
pair
may
be
while
the
worst
evils
of
life
are
lightened
and
made
bearable
by
its
presence
marrying
for
love
need
not
mean
improvidence
only
an
unreasoning
passion
based
on
selfishness
will
plunge
the
beloved
into
privation
and
want
the
highest
truest
love
has
its
substratum
of
common
sense
and
thought
for
others
it
is
very
hard
to
draw
the
line
for
vices
and
virtues
tread
somewhat
closely
on
each
other
heels
the
division
between
prudence
and
cowardice
is
often
the
love
that
rushes
into
poverty
that
it
is
not
strong
enough
to
endure
has
in
it
an
element
of
the
selfishness
that
makes
another
sit
still
in
comfort
while
the
path
is
being
made
smooth
for
her
soft
tread
there
are
those
who
laugh
at
love
and
say
that
mutual
respect
and
sufficient
means
are
the
only
two
reliable
things
with
which
to
enter
upon
matrimony
both
these
excellent
possessions
may
however
be
quite
compatible
with
love
in
fact
the
former
is
bound
to
be
included
in
the
softer
passion
or
it
will
not
wear
very
well
no
one
will
deny
that
a
marriage
founded
on
mere
mutual
respect
may
one
day
be
crowned
by
true
and
lasting
love
nor
yet
that
love
may
die
a
speedy
or
even
violent
death
soon
after
the
lovers
are
united
but
these
possibilities
do
not
alter
the
fact
that
taking
things
all
round
love
is
the
best
and
most
precious
asset
with
which
to
begin
married
life
marrying
for
money
there
are
many
marriages
that
are
casually
put
under
this
heading
which
do
not
deserve
to
be
a
man
position
may
be
such
that
it
will
mean
ruin
to
him
if
he
adds
to
his
expenses
by
taking
a
wife
without
a
penny
he
honourably
refrains
from
making
any
advances
to
girls
who
are
so
situated
but
that
does
not
prevent
his
becoming
really
attached
to
one
whose
income
will
make
married
life
possible
for
him
the
possession
of
money
does
not
make
a
woman
unlovable
for
herself
though
it
may
give
her
an
unenviable
experience
at
the
hands
of
the
fortune
hunter
the
cold
calculating
nature
that
deliberately
plans
a
mercenary
marriage
is
probably
satisfied
for
the
time
being
by
the
acquisition
of
the
coveted
wealth
little
pity
will
be
given
when
the
human
element
of
the
man
or
woman
begins
to
cry
out
for
something
more
than
money
can
buy
there
are
excuses
for
some
mercenary
alliances
the
daughter
of
impecunious
parents
whose
youth
has
been
clouded
by
grey
grinding
poverty
and
who
sees
the
prospects
of
her
brothers
and
sisters
blighted
by
lack
of
means
to
start
them
in
life
is
to
be
pardoned
if
not
commended
when
she
marries
for
money
but
she
should
not
deceive
the
man
who
gives
it
to
her
if
she
does
not
love
him
the
man
with
talents
and
high
ambitions
may
easily
be
tempted
to
take
the
wife
whose
money
will
open
a
field
for
the
realisation
of
his
hopes
he
would
be
more
of
a
man
if
he
fought
his
way
through
alone
the
curse
of
it
all
is
that
no
one
marrying
for
money
dares
say
so
it
would
be
brutal
no
doubt
and
unless
there
were
some
fair
equivalent
to
offer
in
exchange
probably
few
such
marriages
would
take
place
when
the
cloak
of
simulated
love
is
thrown
over
the
real
motive
often
only
to
be
cast
aside
as
soon
as
the
prize
is
secured
it
is
hard
not
to
feel
contempt
and
indignation
marriage
money
is
a
necessity
marriage
money
is
a
mere
business
affair
a
travesty
of
the
sacred
institution
he
that
marries
for
money
sells
his
liberty
it
is
humiliating
enough
for
a
woman
but
immeasurably
mean
in
a
man
marrying
for
a
home
the
woman
with
strong
domestic
instincts
who
dreads
to
face
life
alone
or
has
grown
weary
in
the
attempt
to
wage
the
fight
often
yields
to
the
temptation
of
marrying
one
who
can
give
her
a
home
with
only
a
secondary
regard
for
the
man
himself
if
she
duly
counts
the
cost
and
does
not
ask
too
much
the
plan
may
succeed
very
well
but
the
entirely
domestic
woman
does
not
hold
the
highest
place
in
a
man
mind
he
may
fully
value
the
creature
comforts
she
ensures
for
him
but
she
so
soon
becomes
a
drudge
and
so
soon
loses
touch
with
the
higher
side
of
his
nature
that
he
will
probably
seek
sympathy
elsewhere
and
salve
his
conscience
with
the
thought
that
he
has
given
her
what
she
really
wanted
most
she
must
never
forget
that
she
has
to
reckon
with
the
man
who
has
provided
her
with
a
home
and
she
will
probably
have
to
repay
him
in
whatever
coin
he
may
choose
marrying
for
a
housekeeper
the
man
who
must
keep
a
home
together
and
maintain
appearances
grows
tired
of
wrestling
with
domestic
problems
and
either
dreads
the
sudden
departure
of
his
or
trembles
under
her
tyrannical
sway
he
finally
takes
a
lady
who
can
not
give
him
a
notice
nor
leave
his
roof
by
stealth
without
unpleasant
consequences
to
herself
when
he
thus
primarily
marries
for
a
housekeeper
who
will
promote
his
own
comfort
he
should
be
satisfied
if
she
shows
the
needful
domestic
efficiency
he
sometimes
finds
that
the
one
who
was
intended
to
be
little
more
than
a
dependant
turns
out
to
be
his
mistress
there
are
plenty
of
women
who
have
done
with
romance
and
who
are
perfectly
willing
to
take
up
the
position
of
wife
to
a
man
who
honestly
states
that
he
requires
a
companion
to
help
his
digestion
by
conversing
at
meals
to
manage
his
house
entertain
his
guests
and
darn
his
socks
when
such
a
couple
meet
together
let
them
show
mutual
respect
for
each
other
motives
and
invest
the
arrangement
with
comfort
and
dignity
in
the
absence
of
tenderer
emotions
concluding
remarks
however
short
a
marriage
may
fall
of
the
high
ideal
standpoint
there
should
never
be
recrimination
in
public
between
man
and
wife
nor
the
utterance
of
taunts
as
to
the
avarice
expediency
or
cowardice
that
may
have
influenced
either
side
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
few
attain
to
the
highest
happiness
of
which
we
are
capable
in
this
state
few
perhaps
make
the
most
of
what
they
have
yet
it
is
very
rare
to
find
a
married
woman
who
honestly
wishes
herself
single
and
that
is
a
powerful
argument
in
favour
of
an
institution
which
seems
to
give
the
weaker
sex
her
full
share
of
the
burden
there
is
much
discussion
nowadays
on
the
relative
positions
of
the
sexes
the

lines
