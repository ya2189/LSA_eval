preface
this
book
is
written
for
the
guidance
of
the
novice
in
aviation
the
man
who
seeks
practical
information
as
to
the
theory
construction
and
operation
of
the
modern
flying
machine
with
this
object
in
view
the
wording
is
intentionally
plain
and
it
contains
some
propositions
which
so
far
as
satisfying
the
experts
is
concerned
might
doubtless
be
better
stated
in
technical
terms
but
this
would
defeat
the
main
purpose
of
its
preparation
consequently
while
fully
aware
of
its
shortcomings
in
this
respect
the
authors
have
no
apologies
to
make
in
the
stating
of
a
technical
proposition
so
it
may
be
clearly
understood
by
people
not
versed
in
technical
matters
it
becomes
absolutely
necessary
to
use
language
much
different
from
that
which
an
expert
would
employ
and
this
has
been
done
in
this
volume
no
man
of
ordinary
intelligence
can
read
this
book
without
obtaining
a
clear
comprehensive
knowledge
of
flying
machine
construction
and
operation
he
will
learn
not
only
how
to
build
equip
and
manipulate
an
aeroplane
in
actual
flight
but
will
also
gain
a
thorough
understanding
of
the
principle
upon
which
the
suspension
in
the
air
of
an
object
much
heavier
than
the
air
is
made
possible
this
latter
feature
should
make
the
book
of
interest
even
to
those
who
have
no
intention
of
constructing
or
operating
a
flying
machine
it
will
enable
them
to
better
understand
and
appreciate
the
performances
of
the
daring
men
like
the
wright
brothers
curtiss
bleriot
farman
paulhan
latham
and
others
whose
bold
experiments
have
made
aviation
an
actuality
for
those
who
wish
to
engage
in
the
fascinating
pastime
of
construction
and
operation
it
is
intended
as
a
reliable
practical
guide
it
may
be
well
to
explain
that
the
in
the
articles
by
chanute
were
inserted
by
the
authors
without
his
knowledge
the
purpose
of
this
was
merely
to
preserve
uniformity
in
the
typography
of
the
book
this
explanation
is
made
in
justice
to
chanute
the
authors
in
memoriam
octave
chanute
the
father
of
the
modern
flying
machine
died
at
his
home
in
chicago
on
november
at
the
age
of
years
his
last
work
in
the
interest
of
aviation
was
to
furnish
the
introductory
chapter
to
the
first
edition
of
this
volume
and
to
render
valuable
assistance
in
the
handling
of
the
various
subjects
he
even
made
the
trip
from
his
home
to
the
office
of
the
publishers
one
inclement
day
last
spring
to
look
over
the
proofs
of
the
book
and
at
his
suggestion
several
important
changes
were
made
all
this
was
a
labor
of
love
on
chanute
part
he
gave
of
his
time
and
talents
freely
because
he
was
enthusiastic
in
the
cause
of
aviation
and
because
he
knew
the
authors
of
this
book
and
desired
to
give
them
material
aid
in
the
preparation
of
the
work
a
favor
that
was
most
sincerely
appreciated

asked
to
set
forth
the
development
of
the
type
of
flying
machine
which
is
now
used
with
modifications
by
wright
brothers
farman
delagrange
herring
and
others
this
type
originated
with
wenham
who
patented
it
in
england
in
no
taking
out
provisional
papers
only
in
the
abridgment
of
british
patent
aeronautical
specifications
it
is
described
as
follows
two
or
more
aeroplanes
are
arranged
one
above
the
other
and
support
a
framework
or
car
containing
the
motive
power
the
aeroplanes
are
made
of
silk
or
canvas
stretched
on
a
frame
by
wooden
rods
or
steel
ribs
when
manual
power
is
employed
the
body
is
placed
horizontally
and
oars
or
propellers
are
actuated
by
the
arms
or
legs
a
start
may
be
obtained
by
lowering
the
legs
and
running
down
hill
or
the
machine
may
be
started
from
a
moving
carriage
one
or
more
screw
propellers
may
be
applied
for
propelling
when
steam
power
is
employed
on
june
wenham
read
before
the
aeronautical
society
of
great
britain
then
recently
organized
the
ablest
paper
ever
presented
to
that
society
and
thereby
breathed
into
it
a
spirit
which
has
continued
to
this
day
in
this
paper
he
described
his
observations
of
birds
discussed
the
laws
governing
flight
as
to
the
surfaces
and
power
required
both
with
wings
and
screws
and
he
then
gave
an
account
of
his
own
experiments
with
models
and
with
aeroplanes
of
sufficient
size
to
carry
the
weight
of
a
man
second
wenham
aeroplane
his
second
aeroplane
was
sixteen
feet
from
tip
to
tip
a
trussed
spar
at
the
bottom
carried
six
superposed
bands
of
thin
holland
fabric
fifteen
inches
wide
connected
with
vertical
webs
of
holland
two
feet
apart
thus
virtually
giving
a
length
of
wing
of
feet
and
one
hundred
and
twenty
square
feet
of
supporting
surface
the
man
was
placed
horizontally
on
a
base
board
beneath
the
spar
this
apparatus
when
tried
in
the
wind
was
found
to
be
unmanageable
by
reason
of
the
fluttering
motions
of
the
fabric
which
was
insufficiently
stiffened
with
crinoline
steel
but
wenham
pointed
out
that
this
in
no
way
invalidated
the
principle
of
the
apparatus
which
was
to
obtain
large
supporting
surfaces
without
increasing
unduly
the
leverage
and
consequent
weight
of
spar
required
by
simply
superposing
the
surfaces
this
principle
is
entirely
sound
and
it
is
surprising
that
it
is
to
this
day
not
realized
by
those
aviators
who
are
hankering
for
monoplanes
experiments
by
stringfellow
the
next
man
to
test
an
apparatus
with
superposed
surfaces
was
stringfellow
who
becoming
much
impressed
with
wenham
proposal
produced
a
largish
model
at
the
exhibition
of
the
aeronautical
society
in
it
consisted
of
three
superposed
surfaces
aggregating
square
feet
and
a
tail
of
square
feet
more
the
weight
was
under
pounds
and
it
was
driven
by
a
central
propeller
actuated
by
a
steam
engine
overestimated
at
of
a
horsepower
it
ran
suspended
to
a
wire
on
its
trials
but
failed
of
free
flight
in
consequence
of
defective
equilibrium
this
apparatus
has
since
been
rebuilt
and
is
now
in
the
national
museum
of
the
smithsonian
institution
at
washington
unsuccessful
efforts
in
linfield
tested
an
apparatus
in
england
consisting
of
a
car
to
which
was
attached
on
each
side
frames
five
feet
square
containing
each
superposed
planes
of
stretched
and
varnished
linen
eighteen
inches
wide
and
only
two
inches
apart
thus
reminding
one
of
a
spanish
donkey
with
panniers
the
whole
weighed
two
hundred
and
forty
pounds
this
was
tested
by
being
mounted
on
a
flat
car
behind
a
locomotive
going
miles
an
hour
when
towed
by
a
line
fifteen
feet
long
the
apparatus
rose
only
a
little
from
the
car
and
exhibited
such
unstable
equilibrium
that
the
experiment
was
not
renewed
the
lift
was
only
about
of
what
it
would
have
been
had
the
planes
been
properly
spaced
say
their
full
width
apart
instead
of
as
erroneously
devised
renard
dirigible
parachute
in
commandant
renard
the
eminent
superintendent
of
the
french
aeronautical
department
exhibited
at
the
paris
exposition
of
that
year
an
apparatus
experimented
with
some
years
before
which
he
termed
a
dirigible
parachute
it
consisted
of
an
oviform
body
to
which
were
pivoted
two
upright
slats
carrying
above
the
body
nine
long
superposed
flat
blades
spaced
about
of
their
width
apart
when
this
apparatus
was
properly
set
at
an
angle
to
the
longitudinal
axis
of
the
body
and
dropped
from
a
balloon
it
travelled
back
against
the
wind
for
a
considerable
distance
before
alighting
the
course
could
be
varied
by
a
rudder
no
practical
application
seems
to
have
been
made
of
this
device
by
the
french
war
department
but
holland
the
inventor
of
the
submarine
boat
which
bears
his
name
proposed
in
an
arrangement
of
pivoted
framework
attached
to
the
body
of
a
flying
machine
which
combines
the
principle
of
commandant
renard
with
the
curved
blades
experimented
with
by
phillips
now
to
be
noticed
with
the
addition
of
lifting
screws
inserted
among
the
blades

in

phillips
of

after
some
very
interesting
experiments
with
various
wing
sections
from
which
he
deduced
conclusions
as
to
the
shape
of
maximum
lift
tested
an
apparatus
resembling
a
venetian
blind
which
consisted
of
fifty
wooden
slats
of
peculiar
shape
feet
long
one
and
a
half
inches
wide
and
two
inches
apart
set
in
ten
vertical
upright
boards
all
this
was
carried
upon
a
body
provided
with
three
wheels
it
weighed
pounds
and
was
driven
at
miles
an
hour
on
a
wooden
sidewalk
by
a
steam
engine
of
nine
horsepower
which
actuated
a
screw
the
lift
was
satisfactory
being
perhaps
pounds
per
horsepower
but
the
equilibrium
was
quite
bad
and
the
experiments
were
discontinued
they
were
taken
up
again
in
with
a
similar
apparatus
large
enough
to
carry
a
passenger
but
the
longitudinal
equilibrium
was
found
to
be
defective
then
in
a
new
machine
was
tested
in
which
four
sets
of
frames
carrying
similar
sets
of
slat
sustainers
were
inserted
and
with
this
arrangement
the
longitudinal
stability
was
found
to
be
very
satisfactory
the
whole
apparatus
with
the
operator
weighed
pounds
it
flew
about
yards
when
driven
by
a
motor
of
to
at
miles
an
hour
thus
exhibiting
a
lift
of
about
pounds
per
while
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
aeroplane
of
wright
brothers
exhibits
a
lifting
capacity
of
pounds
to
the
hargrave
kite
experiments
after
experimenting
with
very
many
models
and
building
no
less
than
eighteen
monoplane
flying
model
machines
actuated
by
rubber
by
compressed
air
and
by
steam
lawrence
hargrave
of
sydney
new
south
wales
invented
the
cellular
kite
which
bears
his
name
and
made
it
known
in
a
paper
contributed
to
the
chicago
conference
on
aerial
navigation
in
describing
several
varieties
the
modern
construction
is
well
known
and
consists
of
two
cells
each
of
superposed
surfaces
with
vertical
side
fins
placed
one
behind
the
other
and
connected
by
a
rod
or
frame
this
flies
with
great
steadiness
without
a
tail
hargrave
idea
was
to
use
a
team
of
these
kites
below
which
he
proposed
to
suspend
a
motor
and
propeller
from
which
a
line
would
be
carried
to
an
anchor
in
the
ground
then
by
actuating
the
propeller
the
whole
apparatus
would
move
forward
pick
up
the
anchor
and
fly
away
he
said
the
next
step
is
clear
enough
namely
that
a
flying
machine
with
acres
of
surface
can
be
safely
got
under
way
or
anchored
and
hauled
to
the
ground
by
means
of
the
string
of
kites
the
first
tentative
experiments
did
not
result
well
and
emphasized
the
necessity
for
a
light
motor
so
that
hargrave
has
since
been
engaged
in
developing
one
not
having
convenient
access
to
those
which
have
been
produced
by
the
automobile
designers
and
builders
experiments
with
glider
model
and
here
a
curious
reminiscence
may
be
indulged
in
in
the
present
writer
experimented
with
a
gliding
model
precisely
similar
to
a
hargrave
kite
as
will
be
confirmed
by
mr
herring
it
was
frequently
tested
by
launching
from
the
top
of
a
house
and
glided
downward
very
steadily
in
all
sorts
of
breezes
but
the
angle
of
descent
was
much
steeper
than
that
of
birds
and
the
weight
sustained
per
square
foot
was
less
than
with
single
cells
in
consequence
of
the
lesser
support
afforded
by
the
rear
cell
which
operated
upon
air
already
set
in
motion
downward
by
the
front
cell
so
nothing
more
was
done
with
it
for
it
never
occurred
to
the
writer
to
try
it
as
a
kite
and
he
thus
missed
the
distinction
which
attaches
to
hargrave
name
sir
hiram
maxim
also
introduced
fore
and
aft
superposed
surfaces
in
his
wondrous
flying
machine
of
but
he
relied
chiefly
for
the
lift
upon
his
main
large
surface
and
this
necessitated
so
many
guys
to
prevent
distortion
as
greatly
to
increase
the
head
resistance
and
this
together
with
the
unstable
equilibrium
made
it
evident
that
the
design
of
the
machine
would
have
to
be
changed
how
lilienthal
was
killed
in
otto
lilienthal
the
father
of
modern
aviation
the
man
to
whose
method
of
experimenting
almost
all
present
successes
are
due
after
making
something
like
two
thousand
glides
with
monoplanes
added
a
superposed
surface
to
his
apparatus
and
found
the
control
of
it
much
improved
the
two
surfaces
were
kept
apart
by
two
struts
or
vertical
posts
with
a
few
guy
wires
but
the
connecting
joints
were
weak
and
there
was
nothing
like
trussing
this
eventually
cost
his
most
useful
life
two
weeks
before
that
distressing
loss
to
science
herr
wilhelm
kress
the
distinguished
and
veteran
aviator
of
vienna
witnessed
a
number
of
glides
by
lilienthal
with
his
apparatus
he
noticed
that
it
was
much
wracked
and
wobbly
and
wrote
to
me
after
the
accident
the
connection
of
the
wings
and
the
steering
arrangement
were
very
bad
and
unreliable
i
warned
herr
lilienthal
very
seriously
he
promised
me
that
he
would
soon
put
it
in
order
but
i
fear
that
he
did
not
attend
to
it
immediately
in
point
of
fact
lilienthal
had
built
a
new
machine
upon
a
different
principle
from
which
he
expected
great
results
and
intended
to
make
but
very
few
more
flights
with
the
old
apparatus
he
unwisely
made
one
too
many
and
like
pilcher
was
the
victim
of
a
distorted
apparatus
probably
one
of
the
joints
of
the
struts
gave
way
the

experiments
by
the
writer
in
assisted
by
mr
herring
and
avery
i
experimented
with
several
full
sized
gliding
machines
carrying
a
man
the
first
was
a
lilienthal
monoplane
which
was
deemed
so
cranky
that
it
was
discarded
after
making
about
one
hundred
glides
six
weeks
before
accident
the
second
was
known
as
the
multiple
winged
machine
and
finally
developed
into
five
pairs
of
pivoted
wings
trussed
together
at
the
front
and
one
pair
in
the
rear
it
glided
at
angles
of
descent
of
or
degrees
or
of
one
in
five
and
this
was
deemed
too
steep
then
mr
herring
and
myself
made
computations
to
analyze
the
resistances
we
attributed
much
of
them
to
the
five
front
spars
of
the
wings
and
on
a
sheet
of
paper
i
at
once
drew
the
design
for
a
new
machine
to
be
built
by
mr
herring
being
a
builder
of
bridges
i
trussed
these
surfaces
together
in
order
to
obtain
strength
and
stiffness
when
tested
in
gliding
flight
the
lower
surface
was
found
too
near
the
ground
it
was
taken
off
and
the
remaining
apparatus
now
consisted
of
two
surfaces
connected
together
by
a
girder
composed
of
vertical
posts
and
diagonal
ties
specifically
known
as
a
pratt
truss
then
mr
herring
and
avery
together
devised
and
put
on
an
elastic
attachment
to
the
tail
this
machine
proved
a
success
it
being
safe
and
manageable
over
glides
were
made
with
it
at
angles
of
descent
of
to
degrees
or
one
in
six
to
one
in
seven
first
proposed
by
wenham
the
elastic
tail
attachment
and
the
trussing
of
the
connecting
frame
of
the
superposed
wings
were
the
only
novelties
in
this
machine
for
the
superposing
of
the
surfaces
had
first
been
proposed
by
wenham
but
in
accordance
with
the
popular
perception
which
bestows
all
the
credit
upon
the
man
who
adds
the
last
touch
making
for
success
to
the
labors
of
his
predecessors
the
machine
has
since
been
known
by
many
persons
as
the
chanute
type
of
gliders
much
to
my
personal
gratification
it
has
since
been
improved
in
many
ways
wright
brothers
disregarding
the
fashion
which
prevails
among
birds
have
placed
the
tail
in
front
of
their
apparatus
and
called
it
a
front
rudder
besides
placing
the
operator
in
horizontal
position
instead
of
upright
as
i
did
and
also
providing
a
method
of
warping
the
wings
to
preserve
equilibrium
farman
and
delagrange
under
the
very
able
guidance
and
constructive
work
of
voisin
brothers
then
substituted
many
details
including
a
box
tail
for
the
tail
which
i
used
this
may
have
increased
the
resistance
but
it
adds
to
the
steadiness
now
the
tendency
in
france
seems
to
be
to
go
back
to
the
monoplane
monoplane
idea
wrong
the
advocates
of
the
single
supporting
surface
are
probably
mistaken
it
is
true
that
a
single
surface
shows
a
greater
lift
per
square
foot
than
superposed
surfaces
for
a
given
speed
but
the
increased
weight
due
to
leverage
more
than
counterbalances
this
advantage
by
requiring
heavy
spars
and
some
guys
i
believe
that
the
future
aeroplane
dynamic
flier
will
consist
of
superposed
surfaces
and
now
that
it
has
been
found
that
by
imbedding
suitably
shaped
spars
in
the
cloth
the
head
resistance
may
be
much
diminished
i
see
few
objections
to
superposing
three
four
or
even
five
surfaces
properly
trussed
and
thus
obtaining
a
compact
handy
manageable
and
comparatively
light
apparatus

it
is
not

among

octave
chanute
of
chicago
may
well
be
called
the
developer
of
the
flying
machine
leaving
balloons
and
various
forms
of
out
of
consideration
other
experimenters
notably
langley
and
lilienthal
antedated
him
in
attempting
the
navigation
of
the
air
on
aeroplanes
or
flying
machines
but
none
of
them
were
wholly
successful
and
it
remained
for
chanute
to
demonstrate
the
practicability
of
what
was
then
called
the
gliding
machine
this
term
was
adopted
because
the
apparatus
was
as
the
name
implies
simply
a
gliding
machine
being
without
motor
propulsion
and
intended
solely
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
best
form
of
construction
the
biplane
used
by
chanute
in
is
still
the
basis
of
most
successful
flying
machines

only
radical
difference
being
that

have
been

of

it
was
the
privilege
of
the
author
of
this
book
to
be
guest
at
millers
indiana
in
when
in
collaboration
with
messrs
herring
and
avery
he
was
conducting
the
series
of
experiments
which
have
since
made
possible
the
construction
of
the
modern
flying
machine
which
such
successful
aviators
as
the
wright
brothers
and
others
are
now
using
it
was
a
wild
country
much
frequented
by
eagles
hawks
and
similar
birds
the
enthusiastic
trio
chanute
herring
and
avery
would
watch
for
hours
the
evolutions
of
some
big
bird
in
the
air
agreeing
in
the
end
on
the
verdict
when
we
master
the
principle
of
that
soaring
without
wing
action
we
will
have
come
close
to
solving
the
problem
of
the
flying
machine
aeroplanes
of
various
forms
were
constructed
by
chanute
with
the
assistance
of
messrs
herring
and
avery
until
at
the
time
of
the
writer
visit
they
had
settled
upon
the
biplane
or
machine
mr
herring
later
equipped
this
with
a
rudder
and
made
other
additions
but
the
general
idea
is
still
the
basis
of
the
wright
curtiss
and
other
machines
in
which
by
the
aid
of
gasolene
motors
long
flights
have
been
made

by
the
wrights
in
the
wright
brothers
william
and
orville
who
were
then
in
the
bicycle
business
in
dayton
ohio
became
interested
in
experiments
and
communicated
with
him
the
result
was
that
the
wrights
took
up
chanute
ideas
and
developed
them
further
making
many
additions
of
their
own
one
of
which
was
the
placing
of
a
rudder
in
front
and
the
location
of
the
operator
horizontally
on
the
machine
thus
diminishing
by
the
wind
resistance
of
the
body
for
three
years
the
wrights
experimented
with
the
glider
before
venturing
to
add
a
motor
which
was
not
done
until
they
had
thoroughly
mastered
the
control
of
their
movements
in
the
air
limits
of
the
flying
machine
in
the
opinion
of
competent
experts
it
is
idle
to
look
for
a
commercial
future
for
the
flying
machine
there
is
and
always
will
be
a
limit
to
its
carrying
capacity
which
will
prohibit
its
employment
for
passenger
or
freight
purposes
in
a
wholesale
or
general
way
there
are
some
of
course
who
will
argue
that
because
a
machine
will
carry
two
people
another
may
be
constructed
that
will
carry
a
dozen
but
those
who
make
this
contention
do
not
understand
the
theory
of
weight
sustentation
in
the
air
or
that
the
greater
the
load
the
greater
must
be
the
lifting
power
motors
and
plane
surface
and
that
there
is
a
limit
to
these
as
will
be
explained
later
on
beyond

the

can
not
go
some
practical
uses
at
the

time
there
are
fields
in
which
the
flying

may
be
used
to
great
advantage
these
are
sports

will
always
be
popular
by
reason
of
the
element
of
danger
it
is
a
strange
but
nevertheless
a
true
proposition
that
it
is
this
element
which
adds
zest
to
all
sporting
events

of
otherwise
inaccessible

as

chapter
iii
mechanical
bird
action
in
order
to
understand
the
theory
of
the
modern
flying
machine
one
must
also
understand
bird
action
and
wind
action
in
this
connection
the
following
simple
experiment
will
be
of
interest
take
a
bit
of
cardboard
like
the
lid
of
a
hat
box
and
remove
the
portion
so
as
to
have
a
perfectly
flat
surface
with
a
clean
sharp
edge
holding
the
cardboard
at
arm
length
withdraw
your
hand
leaving
the
cardboard
without
support
what
is
the
result
the
cardboard
being
heavier
than
air
and
having
nothing
to
sustain
it
will
fall
to
the
ground
pick
it
up
and
throw
it
with
considerable
force
against
the
wind
edgewise
what
happens
instead
of
falling
to
the
ground
the
cardboard
sails
along
on
the
wind
remaining
afloat
so
long
as
it
is
in
motion
it
seeks
the
ground
by
gravity
only
as
the
motion
ceases
and
then
by
easy
stages
instead
of
dropping
abruptly
as
in
the
first
instance
here
we
have
a
homely
but
accurate
illustration
of
the
action
of
the
flying
machine
the
motor
does
for
the
latter
what
the
force
of
your
arm
does
for
the
cardboard
imparts
a
motion
which
keeps
it
afloat
the
only
real
difference
is
that
the
motion
given
by
the
motor
is
continuous
and
much
more
powerful
than
that
given
by
your
arm
the
action
of
the
latter
is
limited
and
the
end
of
its
propulsive
force
is
reached
within
a
second
or
two
after
it
is
exerted
while
the
action
of
the
motor
is
prolonged
another
simple
illustration
another
simple
means
of
illustrating
the
principle
of
flying
machine
operation
so
far
as
sustentation
and
the
elevation
and
depression
of
the
planes
is
concerned
is
explained
in
the
accompanying
diagram
a
is
a
piece
of
cardboard
about
by
inches
in
size
b
is
a
piece
of
paper
of
the
same
size
pasted
to
one
edge
of
a
if
you
bend
the
paper
to
a
curve
with
convex
side
up
and
blow
across
it
as
shown
in
figure
c
the
paper
will
rise
instead
of
being
depressed
the
dotted
lines
show
that
the
air
is
passing
over
the
top
of
the
curved
paper
and
yet
no
matter
how
hard
you
may
blow
the
effect
will
be
to
elevate
the
paper
despite
the
fact
that
the
air
is
passing
over
instead
of
under
the
curved
surface
in
figure
d
we
have
an
opposite
effect
here
the
paper
is
in
a
curve
exactly
the
reverse
of
that
shown
in
figure
c
bringing
the
concave
side
up
now
if
you
will
again
blow
across
the
surface
of
the
card
the
action
of
the
paper
will
be
downward
it
will
be
impossible
to
make
it
rise
the
harder
you
blow
the
greater
will
be
the
downward
movement
principle
in
general
use
this
principle
is
taken
advantage
of
in
the
construction
of
all
successful
flying
machines
makers
of
monoplanes
and
biplanes
alike
adhere
to
curved
bodies
with
the
concave
surface
facing
downward
straight
planes
were
tried
for
a
time
but
found
greatly
lacking
in
the
power
of
sustentation
by
curving
the
planes
and
placing
the
concave
surface
downward
a
sort
of
inverted
bowl
is
formed
in
which
the
air
gathers
and
exerts
a
buoyant
effect
just
what
the
ratio
of
the
curve
should
be
is
a
matter
of
contention
in
some
instances
one
inch
to
the
foot
is
found
to
be
satisfactory
in
others
this
is
doubled
and
there
are
a
few
cases
in
which
a
curve
of
as
much
as
inches
to
the
foot
has
been
used
right
here
it
might
be
well
to
explain
that
the
word
plane
applied
to
flying
machines
of
modern
construction
is
in
reality
a
misnomer
plane
indicates
a
flat
level
surface
as
most
successful
flying
machines
have
curved
supporting
surfaces
it
is
clearly
wrong
to
speak
of
planes
or
aeroplanes
usage
however
has
made
the
terms
convenient
and
as
they
are
generally
accepted
and
understood
by
the
public
they
are
used
in
like
manner
in
this
volume
getting
under
headway
a
bird
on
first
rising
from
the
ground
or
beginning
its
flight
from
a
tree
will
flap
its
wings
to
get
under
headway
here
again
we
have
another
illustration
of
the
manner
in
which
a
flying
machine
gets
under
headway
the
motor
imparts
the
force
necessary
to
put
the
machine
into
the
air
but
right
here
the
similarity
ceases
if
the
machine
is
to
be
kept
afloat
the
motor
must
be
kept
moving
a
flying
machine
will
not
sustain
itself
it
will
not
remain
suspended
in
the
air
unless
it
is
under
headway
this
is
because
it
is
heavier
than
air
and
gravity
draws
it
to
the
ground
puzzle
in
bird
soaring
but
a
bird
which
is
also
heavier
than
air
will
remain
suspended
in
a
calm
will
even
soar
and
move
in
a
circle
without
apparent
movement
of
its
wings
this
is
explained
on
the
theory
that
there
are
generally
vertical
columns
of
air
in
circulation
strong
enough
to
sustain
a
bird
but
much
too
weak
to
exert
any
lifting
power
on
a
flying
machine
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
a
bird
can
remain
suspended
when
the
wind
is
in
action
but
its
suspension
in
a
seeming
dead
calm
was
a
puzzle
to
scientists
until
chanute
advanced
the
proposition
of
vertical
columns
of
air
modeled
closely
after
birds
so
far
as
possible
builders
of
flying
machines
have
taken
what
may
be
called
the
architecture
of
birds
as
a
model
this
is
readily
noticeable
in
the
form
of
construction
when
a
bird
is
in
motion
its
wings
except
when
flapping
are
extended
in
a
straight
line
at
right
angles
to
its
body
this
brings
a
sharp
thin
edge
against
the
air
offering
the
least
possible
surface
for
resistance
while
at
the
same
time
a
broad
surface
for
support
is
afforded
by
the
flat
under
side
of
the
wings
identically
the
same
thing
is
done
in
the
construction
of
the
flying
machine
note
for
instance
the
marked
similarity
in
form
as
shown
in
the
illustration
in
chapter
ii
here
a
is
the
bird
and
b
the
general
outline
of
the
machine
the
thin
edge
of
the
plane
in
the
latter
is
almost
a
duplicate
of
that
formed
by
the
outstretched
wings
of
the
bird
while
the
rudder
plane
in
the
rear
serves
the
same
purpose
as
the
tail
chapter
iv
various
forms
of
flying
machines
there
are
three
distinct
and
radically
different
forms
of
flying
machines
these
are
aeroplanes
helicopters
and
ornithopers
of
these
the
aeroplane
takes
precedence
and
is
used
almost
exclusively
by
successful
aviators
the
helicopters
and
ornithopers
having
been
tried
and
found
lacking
in
some
vital
features
while
at
the
same
time
in
some
respects
the
helicopter
has
advantages
not
found
in
the
aeroplane
what
the
helicopter
is
the
helicopter
gets
its
name
from
being
fitted
with
vertical
propellers
or
helices
see
illustration
by
the
action
of
which
the
machine
is
raised
directly
from
the
ground
into
the
air
this
does
away
with
the
necessity
for
getting
the
machine
under
a
gliding
headway
before
it
floats
as
is
the
case
with
the
aeroplane
and
consequently
the
helicopter
can
be
handled
in
a
much
smaller
space
than
is
required
for
an
aeroplane
this
in
many
instances
is
an
important
advantage
but
it
is
the
only
one
the
helicopter
possesses
and
is
more
than
overcome
by
its
drawbacks
the
most
serious
of
these
is
that
the
helicopter
is
deficient
in
sustaining
capacity
and
requires
too
much
motive
power
form
of
the
ornithopter
the
ornithopter
has
hinged
planes
which
work
like
the
wings
of
a
bird
at
first
thought
this
would
seem
to
be
the
correct
principle
and
most
of
the
early
experimenters
conducted
their
operations
on
this
line
it
is
now
generally
understood
however
that
the
bird
in
soaring
is
in
reality
an
aeroplane
its
extended
wings
serving
to
sustain
as
well
as
propel
the
body
at
any
rate
the
ornithoper
has
not
been
successful
in
aviation
and
has
been
interesting
mainly
as
an
ingenious
toy
attempts
to
construct
it
on
a
scale
that
would
permit
of
its
use
by
man
in
actual
aerial
flights
have
been
far
from
encouraging
three
kinds
of
aeroplanes
there
are
three
forms
of
aeroplanes
with
all
of
which
more
or
less
success
has
been
attained
these
are
the
monoplane
a
plane
like
that
used
by
bleriot
the
biplane
a
plane
now
used
by
the
wrights
curtiss
farman
and
others
the
triplane
a
plane
this
form
is
but
little
used
its
only
prominent
advocate
at
present
being
elle
lavimer
a
danish
experimenter
who
has
not
thus
far
accomplished
much
whatever
of
real
success
has
been
accomplished
in
aviation
may
be
credited
to
the
monoplane
and
biplane
with
the
balance
in
favor
of
the
latter
the
monoplane
is
the
more
simple
in
construction
and
where
capacity
is
not
a
prime
requisite
may
probably
be
found
the
most
convenient
this
opinion
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
smaller
the
surface
of
the
plane
the
less
will
be
the
resistance
offered
to
the
air
and
the
greater
will
be
the
speed
at
which
the
machine
may
be
moved
on
the
other
hand
the
biplane
has
a
much
greater
plane
surface
double
that
of
a
monoplane
of
the
same
size
and
consequently
much
greater
capacity
differences
in
biplanes
while
all
biplanes
are
of
the
same
general
construction
so
far
as
the
main
planes
are
concerned
each
aviator
has
his
own
ideas
as
to
the

for
instance
places
a
double
horizontal
rudder
in

with
a

chapter
constructing
a
gliding
machine
first
decide
upon
the
kind
of
a
machine
you
want
monoplane
biplane
or
triplane
for
a
novice
the
biplane
will
as
a
rule
be
found
the
most
satisfactory
as
it
is
more
compact
and
therefore
the
more
easily
handled
this
will
be
easily
understood
when
we
realize
that
the
surface
of
a
flying
machine
should
be
laid
out
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
weight
it
will
have
to
sustain
the
generally
accepted
rule
is
that
square
feet
of
surface
will
sustain
the
weight
of
an
man
say
pounds
now
it
follows
that
if
these
square
feet
of
surface
are
used
in
one
plane
as
in
the
monoplane
the
length
and
width
of
this
plane
must
be
greater
than
if
the
same
amount
of
surface
is
secured
by
using
two
planes
the
biplane
this
results
in
the
biplane
being
more
compact
and
therefore
more
readily
manipulated
than
the
monoplane
which
is
an
important
item
for
a
novice
glider
the
basis
of
success
flying
machines
without
motors
are
called
gliders
in
making
a
flying
machine
you
first
construct
the
glider
if
you
use
it
in
this
form
it
remains
a
glider
if
you
install
a
motor
it
becomes
a
flying
machine
you
must
have
a
good
glider
as
the
basis
of
a
successful
flying
machine
it
will
be
well
for
the
novice
the
man
who
has
never
had
any
experience
as
an
aviator
to
begin
with
a
glider
and
master
its
construction
and
operation
before
he
essays
the
more
pretentious
task
of
handling
a
flying
machine
in
fact
it
is
essential
that
he
should
do
so
plans
for
handy
glider
a
glider
with
a
spread
advancing
edge
of
feet
and
a
breadth
or
depth
of
feet
will
be
about
right
to
begin
with
two
planes
of
this
size
will
give
the
square
yards
of
surface
necessary
to
sustain
a
man
weight
remember
that
in
referring
to
flying
machine
measurements
spread
takes
the
place
of
what
would
ordinarily
be
called
length
and
invariably
applies
to
the
long
or
advancing
edge
of
the
machine
which
cuts
into
the
air
thus
a
glider
is
spoken
of
as
being
feet
spread
and
feet
in
depth
so
far
as
mastering
the
control
of
the
machine
is
concerned
learning
to
balance
one
self
in
the
air
guiding
the
machine
in
any
desired
direction
by
changing
the
position
of
the
body
all
this
may
be
learned
just
as
readily
and
perhaps
more
so
with
a
glider
than
with
a
larger
apparatus
kind
of
material
required
there
are
three
features
in
flying
machine
construction
viz
lightness
strength
and
extreme
rigidity
spruce
is
the
wood
generally
used
for
glider
frames
oak
ash
and
hickory
are
all
stronger
but
they
are
also
considerably
heavier
and
where
the
saving
of
weight
is
essential
the
difference
is
largely
in
favor
of
spruce
this
will
be
seen
in
the
following
table
weight

cubic
ft
strength

lbs
lbs

in
lbs
per

hickory
oak
ash
walnut
spruce
pine
considering
the
marked
saving
in
weight
spruce
has
a
greater
percentage
of
tensile
strength
than
any
of
the
other
woods
it
is
also
easier
to
find
in
long
pieces
free
from
knots
and
it
is
this
kind
only
that
should
be
used
in
flying
machine
construction
you
will
next
need
some
spools
or
hanks
of
no
linen
shoe
thread
metal
sockets
a
supply
of
strong
piano
wire
a
quantity
of
silk
or
cotton
cloth
glue
turnbuckles
varnish
etc
names
of
the
various
parts
the
long
strips
four
in
number
which
form
the
front
and
rear
edges
of
the
upper
and
lower
frames
are
called
the
horizontal
beams
these
are
each
feet
in
length
these
horizontal
beams
are
connected
by
upright
strips
feet
long
called
stanchions
there
are
usually
of
these
six
on
the
front
edge
and
six
on
the
rear
they
serve
to
hold
the
upper
plane
away
from
the
lower
one
next
comes
the
ribs
these
are
feet
in
length
projecting
for
a
foot
over
the
rear
beam
and
while
intended
principally
as
a
support
to
the
cloth
covering
of
the
planes
also
tend
to
hold
the
frame
together
in
a
horizontal
position
just
as
the
stanchions
do
in
the
vertical
there
are
of
these
ribs
on
the
upper
and
twenty
on
the
lower
plane
then
come
the
struts
the
main
pieces
which
join
the
horizontal
beams
all
of
these
parts
are
shown
in
the
illustrations
reference
to
which
will
make
the
meaning
of
the
various
names
clear
quantity
and
cost
of
material
for
the
horizontal
beams
four
pieces
of
spruce
feet
long
inches
wide
and
inch
thick
are
necessary
these
pieces
must
be
and
absolutely
free
from
knots
if
it
is
impossible
to
obtain
clear
pieces
of
this
length
shorter
ones
may
be
spliced
but
this
is
not
advised
as
it
adds
materially
to
the
weight
the
twelve
stanchions
should
be
feet
long
and
inch
in
diameter
and
rounded
in
form
so
as
to
offer
as
little
resistance
as
possible
to
the
wind
the
struts
there
are
twelve
of
them
are
feet
long
by
x
inch
for
a
biplane
about
yards
of
stout
silk
or
unbleached
muslin
of
standard
one
yard
width
will
be
needed
the
ribs
are
each
feet
long
and
inch
square
a
roll
of
no
piano
wire
sockets
a
package
of
small
copper
tacks
a
pot
of
glue
and
similar
accessories
will
be
required
the
entire
cost
of
this
material
should
not
exceed
the
wood
and
cloth
will
be
the
two
largest
items
and
these
should
not
cost
more
than
this
leaves
for
the
varnish
wire
tacks
glue
and
other
incidentals
this
estimate
is
made
for
cost
of
materials
only
it
being
taken
for
granted
that
the
experimenter
will
construct
his
own
glider
should
the
services
of
a
carpenter
be
required
the
total
cost
will
probably
approximate
or
application
of
the
rudders
the
figures
given
also
include
the
expense
of
rudders
but
the
details
of
these
have
not
been
included
as
the
glider
is
really
complete
without
them
some
of
the
best
flights
the
writer
ever
saw
were
made
by
herring
in
a
glider
without
a
rudder
and
yet
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
rudder
properly
proportioned
and
placed
especially
a
rear
rudder
is
of
great
value
to
the
aviator
as
it
keeps
the
machine
with
its
head
to
the
wind
which
is
the
only
safe
position
for
a
novice
for
initial
educational
purposes
however
a
rudder
is
not
essential
as
the
glides
will
or
should
be
made
on
level
ground
in
moderate
steady
wind
currents
and
at
a
modest
elevation
the
addition
of
a
rudder
therefore
may
well
be
left
until
the
aviator
has
become
reasonably
expert
in
the
management
of
his
machine
putting
the
machine
together
having
obtained
the
necessary
material
the
first
move
is
to
have
the
rib
pieces
steamed
and
curved
this
curve
may
be
slight
about
inches
for
the
feet
while
this
is
being
done
the
other
parts
should
be
carefully
rounded
so
the
square
edges
will
be
taken
off
this
may
be
done
with
sand
paper
next
apply
a
coat
of
shellac
and
when
dry
rub
it
down
thoroughly
with
fine
sand
paper
when
the
ribs
are
curved
treat
them
in
the
same
way
lay
two
of
the
long
horizontal
frame
pieces
on
the
floor
feet
apart
between
these
place
six
of
the
strut
pieces
put
one
at
each
end
and
each
feet
put
another
leaving
a
space
in
the
center
this
will
give
you
four
struts
feet
apart
and
two
in
the
center
feet
apart
as
shown
in
the
illustration
this
makes
five
rectangles
be
sure
that
the
points
of
contact
are
perfect
and
that
the
struts
are
exactly
at
right
angles
with
the
horizontal
frames
this
is
a
most
important
feature
because
if
your
frame
skews
or
twists
you
can
not
keep
it
straight
in
the
air
now
glue
the
ends
of
the
struts
to
the
frame
pieces
using
plenty
of
glue
and
nail
on
strips
that
will
hold
the
frame
in
place
while
the
glue
is
drying
the
next
day
lash
the
joints
together
firmly
with
the
shoe
thread
winding
it
as
you
would
to
mend
a
broken
gun
stock
and
over
each
layer
put
a
coating
of
glue
this
done
the
other
frame
pieces
and
struts
may
be
treated
in
the
same
way
and
you
will
thus
get
the
foundations
for
the
two
planes
another
way
of
placing
struts
in
the
machines
built
for
professional
use
a
stronger
and
more
certain
form
of
construction
is
desired
this
is
secured
by
the
placing
the
struts
for
the
lower
plane
under
the
frame
piece
and
those
for
the
upper
plane
over
it
allowing
them
in
each
instance
to
come
out
flush
with
the
outer
edges
of
the
frame
pieces
they
are
then
securely
fastened
with
a
tie
plate
or
clamp
which
passes
over
the
end
of
the
strut
and
is
bound
firmly
against
the
surface
of
the
frame
piece
by
the
eye
bolts
of
the
stanchion
sockets
placing
the
rib
pieces
take
one
of
the
frames
and
place
on
it
the
ribs
with
the
arched
side
up
letting
one
end
of
the
ribs
come
flush
with
the
front
edge
of
the
forward
frame
and
the
other
end
projecting
about
a
foot
beyond
the
rear
frame
the
manner
of
fastening
the
ribs
to
the
frame
pieces
is
optional
in
some
cases
they
are
lashed
with
shoe
thread
and
in
others
clamped
with
a
metal
clamp
fastened
with
wood
screws
where
clamps
and
screws
are
used
care
should
be
taken
to
make
slight
holes
in
the
wood
with
an
awl
before
starting
the
screws
so
as
to
lessen
any
tendency
to
split
the
wood
on
the
top
frame
ribs
placed
one
foot
apart
will
be
required
on
the
lower
frame
because
of
the
opening
left
for
the
operator
body
you
will
need
only
twenty
joining
the
two
frames
the
two
frames
must
now
be
joined
together
for
this
you
will
need
aluminum
or
iron
sockets
which
may
be
purchased
at
a
foundry
or
hardware
shop
these
sockets
as
the
name
implies
provide
a
receptacle
in
which
the
end
of
a
stanchion
is
firmly
held
and
have
flanges
with
holes
for
which
hold
them
firmly
to
the
frame
pieces
and
also
serve
to
hold
the
guy
wires
in
addition
to
these
holes
there
are
two
others
through
which
screws
are
fastened
into
the
frame
pieces
on
the
front
frame
piece
of
the
bottom
plane
place
six
sockets
beginning
at
the
end
of
the
frame
and
locating
them
exactly
opposite
the
struts
screw
the
sockets
into
position
with
wood
screws
and
then
put
the
in
place
repeat
the
operation
on
the
rear
frame
next
put
the
sockets
for
the
upper
plane
frame
in
place
you
are
now
ready
to
bring
the
two
planes
together
begin
by
inserting
the
stanchions
in
the
sockets
in
the
lower
plane
the
ends
may
need
a
little
rubbing
with
sandpaper
to
get
them
into
the
sockets
but
care
must
be
taken
to
have
them
fit
snugly
when
all
the
stanchions
are
in
place
on
the
lower
plane
lift
the
upper
plane
into
position
and
fit
the
sockets
over
the
upper
ends
of
the
stanchions
trussing
with
guy
wires
the
next
move
is
to
tie
the
frame
together
rigidly
by
the
aid
of
guy
wires
this
is
where
the
no
piano
wire
comes
in
each
rectangle
formed
by
the
struts
and
stanchions
with
the
exception
of
the
small
center
one
is
to
be
wired
separately
as
shown
in
the
illustration
at
each
of
the
eight
corners
forming
the
rectangle
the
ring
of
one
of
the
will
be
found
there
are
two
ways
of
doing
this
tieing
or
trussing
one
is
to
run
the
wires
diagonally
from
to
depending
upon
main
strength
to
pull
them
taut
enough
and
then
twist
the
ends
so
as
to
hold
the
other
is
to
first
make
a
loop
of
wire
at
each
and
connect
these
loops
to
the
main
wires
with
this
latter
method
is
the
best
as
it
admits
of
the
tension
being
regulated
by
simply
turning
the
buckle
so
as
to
draw
the
ends
of
the
wire
closer
together
a
glance
at
the
illustration
will
make
this
plain
and
also
show
how
the
wires
are
to
be
placed
the
proper
degree
of
tension
may
be
determined
in
the
following
manner
after
the
frame
is
wired
place
each
end
on
a
so
as
to
lift
the
entire
frame
clear
of
the
floor
get
under
it
in
the
center
rectangle
and
grasping
the
center
struts
one
in
each
hand
put
your
entire
weight
on
the
structure
if
it
is
properly
put
together
it
will
remain
rigid
and
unyielding
should
it
sag
ever
so
slightly
the
tension
of
the
wires
must
be
increased
until
any
tendency
to
sag
no
matter
how
slight
it
may
be
is
overcome
putting
on
the
cloth
we
are
now
ready
to
put
on
the
cloth
covering
which
holds
the
air
and
makes
the
machine
buoyant
the
kind
of
material
employed
is
of
small
account
so
long
as
it
is
light
strong
and
or
nearly
so
some
aviators
use
what
is
called
rubberized
silk
others
prefer
balloon
cloth
ordinary
muslin
of
good
quality
treated
with
a
coat
of
light
varnish
after
it
is
in
place
will
answer
all
the
purposes
of
the
amateur
cut
the
cloth
into
strips
a
little
over
feet
in
length
as
you
have
feet
in
width
to
cover
and
the
cloth
is
one
yard
wide
you
will
need
seven
strips
for
each
plane
so
as
to
allow
for
laps
etc
this
will
give
you
fourteen
strips
glue
the
end
of
each
strip
around
the
front
horizontal
beams
of
the
planes
and
draw
each
strip
back
over
the
ribs
tacking
the
edges
to
the
ribs
as
you
go
along
with
small
copper
or
brass
tacks
in
doing
this
keep
the
cloth
smooth
and
stretched
tight
tacks
should
also
be
used
in
addition
to
the
glue
to
hold
the
cloth
to
the
horizontal
beams
next
give
the
cloth
a
coat
of
varnish
on
the
clear
or
upper
side
and
when
this
is
dry
your
glider
will
be
ready
for
use
reinforcing
the
cloth
while
not
absolutely
necessary
for
amateur
purposes
reinforcement
of
the
cloth
so
as
to
avoid
any
tendency
to
split
or
tear
out
from
is
desirable
one
way
of
doing
this
is
to
tack
narrow
strips
of
some
heavier
material
like
felt
over
the
cloth
where
it
laps
on
the
ribs
another
is
to
sew
slips
or
pockets
in
the
cloth
itself
and
let
the
ribs
run
through
them
still
another
method
is
to
sew
strips
of
the
same
material
as
the
cover
on
the
cloth
placing
them
about
one
yard
apart
but
having
them
come
in
the
center
of
each
piece
of
covering
and
not
on
the
laps
where
the
various
pieces
are
joined
use
of
armpieces
should
armpieces
be
desired
aside
from
those
afforded
by
the
center
struts
take
two
pieces
of
spruce
feet
long
by
x
inches
and
bolt
them
to
the
front
and
rear
beams
of
the
lower
plane
about
inches
apart
these
will
be
more
comfortable
than
using
the
struts
as
the
operator
will
not
have
to
spread
his
arms
so
much
in
using
the
struts
the
operator
as
a
rule
takes
hold
of
them
with
his
hands
while
with
the
armpieces
as
the
name
implies
he
places
his
arms
over
them
one
of
the
strips
coming
under
each
armpit
frequently
somebody
asks
why
the
ribs
should
be
curved
the
answer
is
easy
the
curvature
tends
to
direct
the
air
downward
toward
the
rear
and
as
the
air
is
thus
forced
downward
there
is
more
or
less
of
an
impact
which
assists
in
propelling
the
aeroplane
upwards
chapter
vi
learning
to
fly
do
be
too
ambitious
at
the
start
go
slow
and
avoid
unnecessary
risks
at
its
best
there
is
an
element
of
danger
in
aviation
which
can
not
be
entirely
eliminated
but
it
may
be
greatly
reduced
and
minimized
by
the
use
of
common
sense
theoretically
the
proper
way
to
begin
a
glide
is
from
the
top
of
an
incline
facing
against
the
wind
so
that
the
machine
will
soar
until
the
attraction
of
gravitation
draws
it
gradually
to
the
ground
this
is
the
manner
in
which
experienced
aviators
operate
but
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
these
men
are
experts
they
understand
air
currents
know
how
to
control
the
action
and
direction
of
their
machines
by
shifting
the
position
of
their
bodies
and
by
so
doing
avoid
accidents
which
would
be
unavoidable
by
a
novice
begin
on
level
ground
make
your
first
flights
on
level
ground
having
a
couple
of
men
to
assist
you
in
getting
the
apparatus
under
headway
take
your
position
in
the
center
rectangle
back
far
enough
to
give
the
forward
edges
of
the
glider
an
inclination
to
tilt
upward
very
slightly
now
start
and
run
forward
at
a
moderately
rapid
gait
one
man
at
each
end
of
the
glider
assisting
you
as
the
glider
cuts
into
the
air
the
wind
will
catch
under
the
uplifted
edges
of
the
curved
planes
and
buoy
it
up
so
that
it
will
rise
in
the
air
and
take
you
with
it
this
rise
will
not
be
great
just
enough
to
keep
you
well
clear
of
the
ground
now
project
your
legs
a
little
to
the
front
so
as
to
shift
the
center
of
gravity
a
trifle
and
bring
the
edges
of
the
glider
on
an
exact
level
with
the
atmosphere
this
with
the
momentum
acquired
in
the
start
will
keep
the
machine
moving
forward
for
some
distance
effect
of
body
movements
when
the
weight
of
the
body
is
slightly
back
of
the
center
of
gravity
the
edges
of
the
advancing
planes
are
tilted
slightly
upward
the
glider
in
this
position
acts
as
a
scoop
taking
in
the
air
which
in
turn
lifts
it
off
the
ground
when
a
certain
altitude
is
reached
this
varies
with
the
force
of
the
wind
the
tendency
to
a
forward
movement
is
lost
and
the
glider
comes
to
the
ground
it
is
to
prolong
the
forward
movement
as
much
as
possible
that
the
operator
shifts
the
center
of
gravity
slightly
bringing
the
apparatus
on
an
even
keel
as
it
were
by
lowering
the
advancing
edges
this
done
so
long
as
there
is
momentum
enough
to
keep
the
glider
moving
it
will
remain
afloat
if
you
shift
your
body
well
forward
it
will
bring
the
front
edges
of
the
glider
down
and
elevate
the
rear
ones
in
this
way
the
air
will
be
spilled
out
at
the
rear
and
having
lost
the
air
support
or
buoyancy
the
glider
comes
down
to
the
ground
a
few
flights
will
make
any
ordinary
man
proficient
in
the
control
of
his
apparatus
by
his
body
movements
not
only
as
concerns
the
elevating
and
depressing
of
the
advancing
edges
but
also
actual
steering
you
will
quickly
learn
for
instance
that
as
the
shifting
of
the
bodily
weight
backwards
and
forwards
affects
the
upward
and
downward
trend
of
the
planes
so
a
movement
sideways
to
the
left
or
the
right
affects
the
direction
in
which
the
glider
travels
ascends
at
an
angle
in
ascending
the
glider
and
flying
machine
like
the
bird
makes
an
angular
not
a
vertical
flight
just
what
this
angle
of
ascension
may
be
is
difficult
to
determine
it
is
probable
and
in
fact
altogether
likely
that
it
varies
with
the
force
of
the
wind
weight
of
the
rising
body
power
of
propulsion
etc
this
in
the
language
of
physicists
is
the
angle
of
inclination
and
as
a
general
thing
under
normal
conditions
still
air
should
be
put
down
as
about
one
in
ten
or
degrees
this
would
be
an
ideal
condition
but
it
has
not
as
vet
been
reached
the
force
of
the
wind
affects
the
angle
considerably
as
does
also
the
weight
and
velocity
of
the
apparatus
in
general
practice
the
angle
varies
from
to
degrees
at
more
than
degrees
the
supporting
effort
is
overcome
by
the
resistance
to
forward
motion
increasing
the
speed
or
propulsive
force
tends
to
lessen
the
angle
at
which
the
machine
may
be
successfully
operated
because
it
reduces
the
wind
pressure
most
of
the
modern
flying
machines
are
operated
at
an
angle
of
degrees
or
less
maintaining
an
equilibrium
stable
equilibrium
is
one
of
the
main
essentials
to
successful
flight
and
this
can
not
be
preserved
in
an
uncertain
gusty
wind
especially
by
an
amateur
the
novice
should
not
attempt
a
glide
unless
the
conditions
are
just
right
these
conditions
are
a
clear
level
space
without
obstructions
such
as
trees
and
a
steady
wind
of
not
exceeding
twelve
miles
an
hour
always
fly
against
the
wind
when
a
reasonable
amount
of
proficiency
in
the
handling
of
the
machine
on
level
ground
has
been
acquired
the
field
of
practice
may
be
changed
to
some
gentle
slope
in
starting
from
a
slope
it
will
be
found
easier
to
keep
the
machine
afloat
but
the
experience
at
first
is
likely
to
be
very
disconcerting
to
a
man
of
less
than
iron
nerve
as
the
glider
sails
away
from
the
top
of
the
slope
the
distance
between
him
and
the
ground
increases
rapidly
until
the
aviator
thinks
he
is
up
a
hundred
miles
in
the
air
if
he
will
keep
cool
manipulate
his
apparatus
so
as
to
preserve
its
equilibrium
and
let
nature
take
its
course
he
will
come
down
gradually
and
safely
to
the
ground
at
a
considerable
distance
from
the
starting
place
this
is
one
advantage
of
starting
from
an
elevation
your
machine
will
go
further
but
if
the
aviator
becomes
rattled
if
he
loses
control
of
his
machine
serious
results
including
a
bad
fall
with
risk
of
death
are
almost
certain
and
yet
this
practice
is
just
as
necessary
as
the
initial
lessons
on
level
ground
when
judgment
is
used
and
haste
made
slowly
there
is
very
little
real
danger
while
experimenting
with
gliders
the
wrights
made
flights
innumerable
under
all
sorts
of
conditions
and
never
had
an
accident
of
any
kind
effects
of
wind
currents
the
larger
the
machine
the
more
difficult
it
will
be
to
control
its
movements
in
the
air
and
yet
enlargement
is
absolutely
necessary
as
weight
in
the
form
of
motor
rudder
is
added
air
currents
near
the
surface
of
the
ground
are
diverted
by
every
obstruction
unless
the
wind
is
blowing
hard
enough
to
remove
the
obstruction
entirely
take
for
instance
the
case
of
a
tree
or
shrub
in
a
moderate
wind
of
from
ten
to
twelve
miles
an
hour
as
the
wind
strikes
the
tree
it
divides
part
going
to
one
side
and
part
going
to
the
other
while
still
another
part
is
directed
upward
and
goes
over
the
top
of
the
obstruction
this
makes
the
handling
of
a
glider
on
an
obstructed
field
difficult
and
uncertain
to
handle
a
glider
successfully
the
place
of
operation
should
be
clear
and
the
wind
moderate
and
steady
if
it
is
gusty
postpone
your
flight
in
this
connection
it
will
be
well
to
understand
the
velocity
of
the
wind
and
what
it
means
as
shown
in
the
following
table
miles
per
hour
feet
per
second
pressure
per
sq
foot
pressure
of
wind
increases
in
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
velocity
thus
wind
at
miles
an
hour
has
four
times
the
pressure
of
wind
at
miles
an
hour
the
greater
this
pressure
the
large
and
heavier
the
object
which
can
be
raised
any
boy
who
has
had
experience
in
flying
kites
can
testify
to
this
high
winds
however
are
almost
invariably
gusty
and
uncertain
as
to
direction
and
this
makes
them
dangerous
for
aviators
it
is
also
a
fact
that
beyond
a
certain
stage
the
harder
the
wind
blows
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
make
headway
against
it

on

designed
and
patented
by

octave
chanute
in
describing
this
invention
in
aeronautics
chanute
says
in
practicing
the
track
preferably
portable
is
generally
laid
in
the
direction
of
the
existing
wind
and
the
car
preferably
a
light
is
placed
on
the
track
the
truck
carrying
the
and
its
motor
is
placed
to
windward
a
suitable
distance
say
from
two
hundred
to
one
thousand
feet
and
is
firmly
blocked
or
anchored
in
line
with
the
portable
track
which
is
preferably
or
feet
in
length
the
flying
or
gliding
machine
to
be
launched
with
its
operator
is
placed
on
the
at
the
leeward
end
of
the
portable
track
the
line
which
is
preferably
a
flexible
combination
cable
is
stretched
between
the
on
the
track
and
detachably
secured
to
the
flying
or
gliding
machine
preferably
by
means
of
a
or
else
held
in
the
hand
of
the
operator
so
that
the
operator
may
readily
detach
the
same
from
the
when
the
desired
height
is
attained
how
glider
is
started
then
upon
a
signal
given
by
the
operator
the
engineer
at
the
motor
puts
it
into
operation
gradually
increasing
the
speed
until
the
line
is
wound
upon
the
drum
at
a
maximum
speed
of
say
thirty
miles
an
hour
the
operator
of
the
whether
he
stands
upright
and
carries
it
on
his
shoulders
or
whether
he
sits
or
lies
down
prone
upon
it
adjusts
the
aeroplane
or
carrying
surfaces
so
that
the
wind
shall
strike
them
on
the
top
and
press
downward
instead
of
upward
until
the
under
action
of
the
and
line
attains
the
required
speed
when
the
operator
judges
that
his
speed
is
sufficient
and
this
depends
upon
the
velocity
of
the
wind
as
well
as
that
of
the
car
moving
against
the
wind
he
quickly
causes
the
front
of
the
to
tip
upward
so
that
the
relative
wind
striking
on
the
under
side
of
the
planes
or
carrying
surfaces
shall
lift
the
flying
machine
into
the
air
it
then
ascends
like
a
kite
to
such
height
as
may
be
desired
by
the
operator
who
then
trips
the
hook
and
releases
the
line
from
the
machine
what
the
operator
does
the
operator
being
now
free
in
the
air
has
a
certain
initial
velocity
imparted
by
the
and
line
and
also
a
potential
energy
corresponding
to
his
height
above
the
ground
if
the
flying
or
gliding
machine
is
provided
with
a
motor
he
can
utilize
that
in
his
further
flight
and
if
it
is
a
simple
gliding
machine
without
motor
he
can
make
a
descending
flight
through
the
air
to
such
distance
as
corresponds
to
the
velocity
acquired
and
the
height
gained
steering
meanwhile
by
the
devices
provided
for
that
purpose
the
simplest
operation
or
maneuver
is
to
continue
the
flight
straight
ahead
against
the
wind
but
it
is
possible
to
vary
this
course
to
the
right
or
left
or
even
to
return
in
downward
flight
with
the
wind
to
the

tips
upward

so
caused
the
operator
is
in
no
way
permanently
fastened
to
his

and
the
machine
and
the
operator
simply
rest
upon
the

may
be
of
any
suitable
kind
or
construction
but
is
preferably
an
electric

the
is
furnished
with
any
suitable
or
customary
to
cause
the

chapter
vii
putting
on
the
rudder
gliders
as
a
rule
have
only
one
rudder
and
this
is
in
the
rear
it
tends
to
keep
the
apparatus
with
its
head
to
the
wind
unlike
the
rudder
on
a
boat
it
is
fixed
and
immovable
the
real
flying
machine
generally
has
both
front
and
rear
rudders
manipulated
by
wire
cables
at
the
will
of
the
operator
allowing
that
the
amateur
has
become
reasonably
expert
in
the
manipulation
of
the
glider
he
should
before
constructing
an
actual
flying
machine
equip
his
glider
with
a
rudder
cross
pieces
for
rudder
beam
to
do
this
he
should
begin
by
putting
in
a
cross
piece
feet
long
by
x
inches
between
the
center
struts
in
the
lower
plane
this
may
be
fastened
to
the
struts
with
bolts
or
braces
the
former
method
is
preferable
on
this
cross
piece
and
on
the
rear
frame
of
the
plane
itself
the
rudder
beam
is
clamped
and
bolted
this
rudder
beam
is
feet
inches
long
having
put
these
in
place
duplicate
them
in
exactly
the
same
manner
and
dimensions
from
the
upper
frame
the
cross
pieces
on
which
the
ends
of
the
rudder
beams
are
clamped
should
be
placed
about
one
foot
in
advance
of
the
rear
frame
beam
the
rudder
itself
the
next
step
is
to
construct
the
rudder
itself
this
consists
of
two
sections
one
horizontal
the
other
vertical
the
latter
keeps
the
aeroplane
headed
into
the
wind
while
the
former
keeps
it
steady
preserves
the
equilibrium
the
rudder
beams
form
the
top
and
bottom
frames
of
the
vertical
rudder
to
these
are
bolted
and
clamped
two
upright
pieces
feet
inches
in
length
and
inch
in
cross
section
these
latter
pieces
are
placed
about
two
feet
apart
this
completes
the
framework
of
the
vertical
rudder
see
next
page
for
the
horizontal
rudder
you
will
require
two
strips
feet
long
and
four
feet
long
find
the
exact
center
of
the
upright
pieces
on
the
vertical
rudder
and
at
this
spot
fasten
with
bolts
the
long
pieces
of
the
horizontal
placing
them
on
the
outside
of
the
vertical
strips
next
join
the
ends
of
the
horizontal
strips
with
the
pieces
using
small
screws
and
corner
braces
this
done
you
will
have
two
of
the
pieces
left
these
go
in
the
center
of
the
horizontal
frame
straddling
the
vertical
strips
as
shown
in
the
illustration
the
framework
is
to
be
covered
with
cloth
in
the
same
manner
as
the
planes
for
this
about
ten
yards
will
be
needed
strengthening
the
rudder
to
ensure
rigidity
the
rudder
must
be
stayed
with
guy
wires
for
this
purpose
the
no
piano
wire
is
the
best
begin
by
running
two
of
these
wires
from
the
top
of
stanchions
and
page
to
rudder
beam
where
it
joins
the
rudder
planes
fastening
them
at
the
bottom
then
run
two
wires
from
the
top
of
the
rudder
beam
at
the
same
point
to
the
bottom
of
the
same
stanchions
this
will
give
you
four
diagonal
wires
reaching
from
the
rudder
beam
to
the
top
and
bottom
planes
of
the
glider
now
from
the
outer
ends
of
the
rudder
frame
run
four
similar
diagonal
wires
to
the
end
of
the
rudder
beam
where
it
rests
on
the
cross
piece
you
will
then
have
eight
truss
wires
strengthening
the
connection
of
the
rudder
to
the
main
body
of
the
glider
the
framework
of
the
rudder
planes
is
then
to
be
braced
in
the
same
way
which
will
take
eight
more
wires
four
for
each
rudder
plane
all
the
wires
are
to
be
connected
at
one
end
with
so
the
tension
may
be
regulated
as
desired
in
forming
the
rudder
frame
it
will
be
well
to
mortise
the
corners
tack
them
together
with
small
nails
and
then
put
in
a
corner
brace
in
the
inside
of
each
joint
in
doing
this
bear
in
mind
that
the
material
to
be
thus
fastened
is
light
and
consequently
the
lightest
of
nails
screws
bolts
and
corner
pieces
is
necessary
chapter
viii
the
real
flying
machine
we
will
now
assume
that
you
have
become
proficient
enough
to
warrant
an
attempt
at
the
construction
of
a
real
flying
machine
one
that
will
not
only
remain
suspended
in
the
air
at
the
will
of
the
operator
but
make
respectable
progress
in
whatever
direction
he
may
desire
to
go
the
glider
it
must
be
remembered
is
not
steerable
except
to
a
limited
extent
and
moves
only
in
one
direction
against
the
wind
besides
this
its
power
of
flotation
suspension
in
the
air
is
circumscribed
larger
surface
area
required
the
real
flying
machine
is
the
glider
enlarged
and
equipped
with
motor
and
propeller
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
decide
upon
the
size
required
while
a
glider
of
foot
spread
is
large
enough
to
sustain
a
man
it
could
not
under
any
possible
conditions
be
made
to
rise
with
the
weight
of
the
motor
propeller
and
similar
equipment
added
as
the
load
is
increased
so
must
the
surface
area
of
the
planes
be
increased
just
what
this
increase
in
surface
area
should
be
is
problematical
as
experienced
aviators
disagree
but
as
a
general
proposition
it
may
be
placed
at
from
three
to
four
times
the
area
of
a
glider
some
practical
examples
the
wrights
used
a
biplane
feet
in
spread
and
deep
this
for
the
two
planes
gives
a
total
surface
area
of
square
feet
inclusive
of
auxiliary
planes
this
sustains
the
engine
equipment
operator
a
total
weight
officially
announced
at
pounds
it
shows
a
lifting
capacity
of
about
two
pounds
to
the
square
foot
of
plane
surface
as
against
a
lifting
capacity
of
about
pound
per
square
foot
of
plane
surface
for
the
glider
this
same
wright
machine
is
also
reported
to
have
made
a
successful
flight
carrying
a
total
load
of
pounds
which
would
be
over
two
pounds
for
each
square
foot
of
surface
area
which
with
auxiliary
planes
is
square
feet
to
attain
the
same
results
in
a
monoplane
the
single
surface
would
have
to
be
feet
in
spread
and
feet
deep
but
while
this
is
the
mathematical
rule
bleriot
has
demonstrated
that
it
does
not
always
hold
good
on
his
trip
across
the
english
channel
july
the
frenchman
was
carried
in
a
monoplane
feet
in
spread
and
with
a
total
sustaining
surface
of
square
feet
the
total
weight
of
the
outfit
including
machine
operator
and
fuel
sufficient
for
a
run
was
only
pounds
with
an
engine
of
nominally
horsepower
the
distance
of
miles
was
covered
in
minutes
which
is
the
best
right
here
an
established
mathematical
quantity
is
involved
a
small
plane
surface
offers
less
resistance
to
the
air
than
a
large
one
and
consequently
can
attain
a
higher
rate
of
speed
as
explained
further
on
in
this
chapter
speed
is
an
important
factor
in
the
matter
of
capacity
a
machine
that
travels
faster
than
another
can
get
along
with
the
surface
area
of
the
latter
without
affecting
the
load
see
the
closing
paragraph
of
this
chapter
on
this
point
in
theory
the
construction
is
also
the
simplest
but
this
is
not
always
found
to
be
so
in
practice
the
designing
and
carrying
into
execution
of
plans
for
an
extensive
area
like
that
of
a
monoplane
involves
great
skill
and
cleverness
in
getting
a
framework
that
will
be
strong
enough
to
furnish
the
requisite
support
without
an
undue
excess
of
weight
this
proposition
is
greatly
simplified
in
the
biplane
and
while
the
speed
attained
by
the
latter
may
not
be
quite
so
great
as
that
of
the
monoplane
it
has
much
larger
capacity
proper
sizes
for
frame
allowing
that
the
biplane
form
is
selected
the
construction
may
be
practically
identical
with
that
of
the
glider
described
in
chapter
except
as
to
size
and
elimination
of
the
armpieces
in
size
the
surface
planes
should
be
about
twice
as
large
as
those
of
the
glider
viz
feet
spread
instead
of
and
feet
deep
instead
of
the
horizontal
beams
struts
stanchions
ribs
should
also
be
increased
in
size
proportionately
while
care
in
the
selection
of
clear
timber
is
important
in
the
glider
it
is
still
more
important
in
the
construction
of
a
flying
machine
as
the
strain
on
the
various
parts
will
be
much
greater
how
to
splice
timbers
it
is
practically
certain
that
you
will
have
to
resort
to
splicing
the
horizontal
beams
as
it
will
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
find
pieces
of
timber
totally
free
from
knots
and
worm
holes
and
of
straight
grain
if
splicing
is
necessary
select
two
good
pieces
inches
wide
and
inches
thick
and
one
long
of
the
same
thickness
and
width
plane
off
the
bottom
sides
of
the
strip
beginning
about
two
feet
back
from
each
end
and
taper
them
so
the
strip
will
be
about
inch
thick
at
the
extreme
ends
lay
the
two
beams
end
to
end
and
under
the
joint
thus
made
place
the
strip
with
the
ends
downward
the
joint
of
the
pieces
should
be
directly
in
the
center
of
the
piece
bore
ten
holes
with
a
augur
apart
through
the
strips
and
the
strip
under
them
through
these
holes
run
stove
bolts
with
round
beveled
heads
in
placing
these
bolts
use
washers
top
and
bottom
one
between
the
head
and
the
top
beam
and
the
other
between
the
bottom
beam
and
the
screw
nut
which
holds
the
bolt
screw
the
nuts
down
hard
so
as
to
bring
the
two
beams
tightly
together
and
you
will
have
a
rigid
beam
splicing
with
metal
sleeves
an
even
better
way
of
making
a
splice
is
by
tonguing
and
grooving
the
ends
of
the
frame
pieces
and
enclosing
them
in
a
metal
sleeve
but
it
requires
more
mechanical
skill
than
the
method
first
named
the
operation
of
tonguing
and
grooving
is
especially
delicate
and
calls
for
extreme
nicety
of
touch
in
the
handling
of
tools
but
if
this
dexterity
is
possessed
the
job
will
be
much
more
satisfactory
than
one
done
with
a
third
timber
as
the
frame
pieces
are
generally
about
inch
in
diameter
the
tongue
and
the
groove
into
which
the
tongue
fits
must
be
correspondingly
small
begin
by
sawing
into
one
side
of
one
of
the
frame
pieces
about
inches
back
from
the
end
make
the
cut
about
inch
deep
then
turn
the
piece
over
and
duplicate
the
cut
next
saw
down
from
the
end
to
these
cuts
when
the
parts
are
removed
you
will
have
a
tongue
in
the
end
of
the
frame
timber
inches
long
and
inch
thick
the
next
move
is
to
saw
out
a
groove
in
the
end
of
the
frame
piece
which
is
to
be
joined
you
will
have
to
use
a
small
chisel
to
remove
the
bit
this
will
leave
a
groove
into
which
the
tongue
will
fit
easily
joining
the
two
pieces
take
a
thin
metal
sleeve
this
is
merely
a
hollow
tube
of
aluminum
or
brass
open
at
each
end
inches
long
and
slip
it
over
either
the
tongued
or
grooved
end
of
one
of
the
frame
timbers
it
is
well
to
have
the
sleeve
fit
snugly
and
this
may
necessitate
a
of
the
frame
pieces
so
the
sleeve
will
slip
on
push
the
sleeve
well
back
out
of
the
way
cover
the
tongue
thoroughly
with
glue
and
also
put
some
on
the
inside
of
the
groove
use
plenty
of
glue
now
press
the
tongue
into
the
groove
and
keep
the
ends
firmly
together
until
the
glue
is
thoroughly
dried
rub
off
the
joint
lightly
with
to
remove
any
of
the
glue
which
may
have
oozed
out
and
slip
the
sleeve
into
place
over
the
joint
tack
the
sleeve
in
position
with
small
copper
tacks
and
you
will
have
an
ideal
splice
the
same
operation
is
to
be
repeated
on
each
of
the
four
frame
pieces
two
pieces
joined
in
this
way
will
give
a
substantial
frame
but
when
suitable
timber
of
this
kind
can
not
be
had
three
pieces
each
feet
inches
long
may
be
used
this
would
give
feet
inches
of
which
inches
will
be
taken
up
in
the
two
joints
leaving
the
frame
feet
inch
long
installation
of

next
comes
the
installation
of
the
motor
the
kinds
and
efficiency
of
the
various
types
are
described
in
the
following
chapter
ix
all
we
are
interested
in
at
this
point
is
the
manner
of
installation
this
varies
according
to
the
personal
ideas
of
the
aviator
thus
one
man
puts
his
motor
in
the
front
of
his
machine
another
places
it
in
the
center
and
still
another
finds
the
rear
of
the
frame
the
best
all
get
good
results
the
comparative
advantages
of
which
it
is
difficult
to
estimate
where
one
man
as
already
explained
flies
faster
than
another
the
one
beaten
from
the
speed
standpoint
has
an
advantage
in
the
matter
of
carrying
weight
etc
the
ideas
of
various
aviators
as
to
the
correct
placing
of
motors
may
be
had
from
the
following
wrights
in
rear
of
machine
and
to
one
side
curtiss
well
to
rear
about
midway
between
upper
and
lower

raich
in

directly
behind

voisin
in

and
on

bleriot
in

in

the
one
chief
object
an
even
distribution
of
the
load
so
as
to
assist
in
maintaining
the
equilibrium
of
the
machine
should
be
the
one
chief
object
in
deciding
upon
the
location
of
the
motor
it
matters
little
what
particular
spot
is
selected
so
long
as
the
weight
does
not
tend
to
overbalance
the
machine
or
to
throw
it
off
an
even
keel
it
is
just
like
loading
a
vessel
an
operation
in
which
the
expert
seeks
to
so
distribute
the
weight
of
the
cargo
as
to
keep
the
vessel
in
a
perfectly
upright
position
and
prevent
a
list
or
leaning
to
one
side
the
more
evenly
the
cargo
is
distributed
the
more
perfect
will
be
the
equilibrium
of
the
vessel
and
the
better
it
can
be
handled
sometimes
when
not
properly
stowed
the
cargo
shifts
and
this
at
once
affects
the
position
of
the
craft
when
a
ship
lists
to
starboard
or
port
a
preponderating
weight
of
the
cargo
has
shifted
sideways
if
bow
or
stern
is
unduly
depressed
it
is
a
sure
indication
that
the
cargo
has
shifted
accordingly
in
either
event
the
handling
of
the
craft
becomes
not
only
difficult
but
extremely
hazardous
exactly
the
same
conditions
prevail
in
the
handling
of
a
flying
machine
shape
of
machine
a
factor
in
placing
the
motor
you
must
be
governed
largely
by
the
shape
and
construction
of
the
flying
machine
frame
if
the
bulk
of
the
weight
of
the
machine
and
auxiliaries
is
toward
the
rear
then
the
natural
location
for
the
motor
will
be
well
to
the
front
so
as
to
counterbalance
the
excess
in
rear
weight
in
the
same
way
if
the
preponderance
of
the
weight
is
forward
then
the
motor
should
be
placed
back
of
the
center
as
the
propeller
blade
is
really
an
integral
part
of
the
motor
the
latter
being
useless
without
it
its
placing
naturally
depends
upon
the
location
selected
for
the
motor
rudders
and
auxiliary
planes
here
again
there
is
great
diversity
of
opinion
among
aviators
as
to
size
location
and
form
the
striking
difference
of
ideas
in
this
respect
is
well
illustrated
in
the
choice
made
by
prominent
makers

as
to
the
best
manner
of
placing
the

hopeless
would
be

why

is

a
frequently
asked
question
is
why
is
not
aluminum
or
some
similar
metal
substituted
for
wood
wood
particularly
spruce
is
preferred
because
weight
considered
it
is
much
stronger
than
aluminum
and
this
is
the
lightest
of
all
metals
in
this
connection

as

combined

especially
tensile
strength
is
the
great
essential
in
construction
it
can
be
readily
seen
that
the
use
of
metal
even
aluminum
for
the
framework
is
prohibited
by
its
weight
while
aluminum
has
double
the
strength
of
spruce
wood
it
is
vastly
heavier
and
thus
the
advantage
it
has
in
strength
is
overbalanced
many
times
by
its
weight
the
specific
gravity
of
aluminum
is
that
of
spruce
is
only
things
to
be
considered
in
laying
out
plans
for
a
flying
machine
there
are
five
important
points
which
should
be
settled
upon
before
the
actual
work
of
construction
is
started
these
are
first
approximate
weight
of
the
machine
when
finished
and
equipped
second
area
of
the
supporting
surface
required
third
amount
of
power
that
will
be
necessary
to
secure
the
desired

and
lifting
capacity
fourth
exact
dimensions
of
the
main
framework
and
of
the
auxiliary
parts
fifth
size
speed
and
character
of
the
propeller
in
deciding
upon
these
it
will
be
well
to
take
into
consideration
the
experience
of
expert
aviators
regarding
these
features
as
given
elsewhere
see
chapter
x
estimating
the
weights
involved
in
fixing
upon
the
probable
approximate
weight
in
advance
of
construction
much
of
course
must
be
assumed
this
means
that
it
will
be
a
matter
of
advance
estimating
if
a
machine
is
to
be
built
we
will
start
by
assuming
the
maximum
combined
weight
of
the
two
people
to
be
pounds
most
of
the
professional
aviators
are
lighter
than
this
taking
the
medium
between
the
weights
of
the
curtiss
and
wright
machines
we
have
a
net
average
of
pounds
for
the
framework
motor
propeller
etc
this
with
the
two
passengers
amounts
to
pounds
as
the
machines
quoted
are
in
successful
operation
it
will
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
this
will
be
a
safe
basis
to
operate
on
what
the
novice
must
avoid
this
does
not
mean
however
that
it
will
be
safe
to
follow
these
weights
exactly
in
construction
but
that
they
will
serve
merely
as
a
basis
to
start
from
because
an
expert
can
turn
out
a
machine
thoroughly
equipped
of
pounds
weight
it
does
not
follow
that
a
novice
can
do
the
same
thing
the
expert
work
is
the
result
of
years
of
experience
and
he
has
learned
how
to
construct
frames
and
motor
plants
of
the
utmost
lightness
and
strength
it
will
be
safer
for
the
novice
to
assume
that
he
can
not
duplicate
the
work
of
such
men
as
wright
and
curtiss
without
adding
materially
to
the
gross
weight
of
the
framework
and
equipment
minus
passengers
how
to
distribute
the
weight
let
us
take
pounds
as
the
net
weight
of
the
machine
as
against
the
same
average
in
the
wright
and
curtiss
machines
now
comes
the
question
of
distributing
this
weight
between
the
framework
motor
and
other
equipment
as
a
general
proposition
the
framework
should
weigh
about
twice
as
much
as
the
complete
power
plant
this
is
for
amateur
work
the
word
framework
indicates
not
only
the
wooden
frames
of
the
main
planes
auxiliary
planes
rudders
but
the
cloth
coverings
as
well
everything
in
fact
except
the
engine
and
propeller
on
the
basis
named
the
framework
would
weigh
pounds
and
the
power
plant
these
figures
are
liberal
and
the
results
desired
may
be
obtained
well
within
them
as
the
novice
will
learn
as
he
makes
progress
in
the
work
figuring
on
surface
area
it
was
langley
who
first
brought
into
prominence
in
connection
with
flying
machine
construction
the
mathematical
principle
that
the
larger
the
object
the
smaller
may
be
the
relative
area
of
support
as
explained
in
chapter
xiii
there
are
mechanical
limits
as
to
size
which
it
is
not
practical
to
exceed
but
the
main
principle
remains
in
effect
take
two
aeroplanes
of
marked
difference
in
area
of
surface
the
larger
will
as
a
rule
sustain
a
greater
weight
in
relative
proportion
to
its
area
than
the
smaller
one
and
do
the
work
with
less
relative
horsepower
as
a
general
thing
machines
will
average
a
supporting
capacity
of
one
pound
for
every
square
foot
of
surface
area
accepting
this
as
a
working
rule
we
find
that
to
sustain
a
weight
of
pounds
machine
and
two
passengers
we
should
have
square
feet
of
surface
distributing
the
surface
area
the
largest
surfaces
now
in
use
are
those
of
the
wright
voisin
and
antoinette
machines
square
feet
in
each
the
actual
sustaining
power
of
these
machines
so
far
as
known
has
never
been
tested
to
the
limit
it
is
probable
that
the
maximum
is
considerably
in
excess
of
what
they
have
been
called
upon
to
show
in
actual
practice
the
average
is
a
little
over
one
pound
for
each
square
foot
of
surface
area
allowing
that
square
feet
of
surface
will
be
used
the
next
question
is
how
to
distribute
it
to
the
best
advantage
this
is
another
important
matter
in
which
individual
preference
must
rule
we
have
seen
how
the
professionals
disagree
on
this
point
some
using
auxiliary
planes
of
large
size
and
others
depending
upon
smaller
auxiliaries
with
an
increase
in
number
so
as
to
secure
on
a
different
plan
virtually
the
same
amount
of
surface
in
deciding
upon
this
feature
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
follow
the
plans
of
some
successful
aviator
increasing
the
area
of
the
auxiliaries
in
proportion
to
the
increase
in
the
area
of
the
main
planes
thus
if
you
use
square
feet
of
surface
where
the
man
whose
plans
you
are
following
uses
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
making
your
planes
larger
all
around
the
cost
of
production
cost
of
production
will
be
of
interest
to
the
amateur
who
essays
to
construct
a
flying
machine
assuming
that
the
size
decided
upon
is
double
that
of
the
glider
the
material
for
the
framework
timber
cloth
wire
will
cost
a
little
more
than
double
this
is
because
it
must
be
heavier
in
proportion
to
the
increased
size
of
the
framework
and
heavy
material
brings
a
larger
price
than
the
lighter
goods
if
we
allow
as
the
cost
of
the
glider
material
it
will
be
safe
to
put
down
the
cost
of
that
required
for
a
real
flying
machine
framework
at
provided
the
owner
builds
it
himself
as
regards
the
cost
of
motor
and
similar
equipment
it
can
only
be
said
that
this
depends
upon
the
selection
made
there
are
some
reliable
aviation
motors
which
may
be
had
as
low
as
and
there
are
others
which
cost
as
much
as
services
of
expert
necessary
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
motor
may
be
selected
the
services
of
an
expert
will
be
necessary
in
its
proper
installation
unless
the
amateur
has
considerable
genius
in
this
line
himself
as
a
general
thing
should
be
a
liberal
allowance
for
this
work
no
matter
how
carefully
the
engine
may
be
placed
and
connected
it
will
be
largely
a
matter
of
luck
if
it
is
installed
in
exactly
the
proper
manner
at
the
first
attempt
the
chances
are
that
several
alterations
prompted
by
the
results
of
trials
will
have
to
be
made
if
this
is
the
case
the
expert
bill
may
readily
run
up
to
if
the
amateur
is
competent
to
do
this
part
of
the
work
the
entire
item
of
may
of
course
be
cut
out
as
a
general
proposition
a
fairly
satisfactory
flying
machine
one
that
will
actually
fly
and
carry
the
operator
with
it
may
be
constructed
for
but
it
will
lack
the
better
qualities
which
mark
the
higher
priced
machines
this
computation
is
made
on
the
basis
of
for
material
for
services
of
expert
for
motor
and
an
allowance
of
for
extras
no
man
who
has
the
flying
machine
germ
in
his
system
will
be
long
satisfied
with
his
first
moderate
price
machine
no
matter
how
well
it
may
work
it
the
old
story
of
the
automobile
bug
over
again
the
man
who
starts
in
with
a
modest
automobile
invariably
progresses
by
easy
stages
to
the
or
class
the
natural
tendency
is
to
want
the
biggest
and
best
attainable
within
the
financial
reach
of
the
owner
it
exactly
the
same
way
with
the
flying
machine
convert
the
more
proficient
he
becomes
in
the
manipulation
of
his
car
the
stronger
becomes
the
desire
to
fly
further
and
stay
in
the
air
longer
than
the
rest
of
his
brethren
this
necessitates
larger
more
powerful
and
more
expensive
machines
as
the
work
of
the
germ
progresses
speed
affects
weight
capacity
do
overlook
the
fact
that
the
greater
speed
you
can
attain
the
smaller
will
be
the
surface
area
you
can
get
along
with
if
a
machine
with
square
feet
of
sustaining
surface
traveling
at
a
speed
of
miles
an
hour
will
carry
a
weight
of
pounds
we
can
cut
the
sustaining
surface
in
half
and
get
along
with
square
feet
provided
a
speed
of
miles
an
hour
can
be
obtained
at
miles
an
hour
only
square
feet
of
surface
area
would
be
required
in
both
instances
the
weight
sustaining
capacity
will
remain
the
same
as
with
the
square
feet
of
surface
area
pounds
one
of
these
days
some
mathematical
genius
will
figure
out
this
problem
with
exactitude
and
we
will
have
a
dependable
table
giving
the
maximum
carrying
capacity
of
various
surface
areas
at
various
stated
speeds
based
on
the
dimensions
of
the
advancing
edges
at
present
it
is
largely
a
matter
of
guesswork
so
far
as
making
accurate
computation
goes
much
depends
upon
the

of
the

the
amount

motors
for
flying
machines
must
be
light
in

of
great
strength
productive
of

and
positively

it
matters
little
as
to
the
particular
form
or
whether

or
water
cooled
so
long
as
the
four
features
named
are

there
are
at

that
the

to
the
horse

produced
as
opposed
to
an
average

in
other
makes
this
result
is
secured
by
the
elimination

obtaining
the

effect
that
would
be
produced
by

even

considerably

which
is
the
nearest
approach
to
the

that
will
make
possible
a
complete

the
total
weight
of
which
will
not
exceed
one
pound
per
square

of
area
how
lightness
is
secured
thus
far
foreign
manufacturers
are
ahead
of
americans
in
the
production
of
aerial
motors
as
is
evidenced
by
the
gnome
and
farcot
engines
both
of
which
are
of
french
make
extreme
lightness
is
made
possible
by
the
use
of
fine
specially
prepared
steel
for
the
cylinders
thus
permitting
them
to
be
much
thinner
than
if
ordinary
forms
of
steel
were
used
another
big
saving
in
weight
is
made
by
substituting
what
are
known
as
auto
lubricating
alloys
for
bearings
these
alloys
are
made
of
a
combination
of
aluminum
and
magnesium
still
further
gains
are
made
in
the
use
of
alloy
steel
tubing
instead
of
solid
rods
and
also
by
the
paring
away
of
material
wherever
it
can
be
done
without
sacrificing
strength
this
plan
with
the
exclusive
use
of
the
best
grades
of
steel
regardless
of
cost
makes
possible
a
marked
reduction
in
weight
multiplicity
of
cylinders
strange
as
it
may
seem
multiplicity
of
cylinders
does
not
always
add
proportionate
weight
because
a
motor
weighs
say
pounds
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
an
equipment
will
weigh
pounds
the
reason
of
this
will
be
plain
when
it
is
understood
that
many
of
the
parts
essential
to
a
motor
will
fill
the
requirements
of
an
motor
without
enlargement
or
addition
neither
does
multiplying
the
cylinders
always
increase
the
horsepower
proportionately
if
a
motor
is
rated
at
horsepower
it
is
not
safe
to
take
it
for
granted
that
double
the
number
of
cylinders
will
give
horsepower
generally
speaking
eight
cylinders
the
bore
stroke
and
speed
being
the
same
will
give
double
the
power
that
can
be
obtained
from
four
but
this
does
not
always
hold
good
just
why
this
exception
should
occur
is
not
explainable
by
any
accepted
rule
horse
power
and
speed
speed
is
an
important
requisite
in
a
motor
as
the
velocity
of
the
aeroplane
is
a
vital
factor
in
flotation
at
first
thought
the
propeller
and
similar
adjuncts
being
equal
the
inexperienced
mind
would
naturally
argue
that
a
engine
should
produce
just
double
the
speed
of
one
of
that
this
is
a
fallacy
is
shown
by
actual
performances
the
wrights
using
a
motor
have
made
miles
an
hour
while
bleriot
with
a
motor
has
a
record
of
a
flight
at
the
rate
of
miles
an
hour
the
fact
is
that
so
far
as
speed
is
concerned
much
depends
upon
the
velocity
of
the
wind
the
size
and
shape
of
the
aeroplane
itself
and
the
size
shape
and
gearing
of
the
propeller
the
stronger
the
wind
is
blowing
the
easier
it
will
be
for
the
aeroplane
to
ascend
but
at
the
same
time
the
more
difficult
it
will
be
to
make
headway
against
the
wind
in
a
horizontal
direction
with
a
strong
head
wind
and
proper
engine
force
your
machine
will
progress
to
a
certain
extent
but
it
will
be
at
an
angle
if
the
aviator
desired
to
keep
on
going
upward
this
would
be
all
right
but
there
is
a
limit
to
the
altitude
which
it
is
desirable
to
reach
from
to
feet
for
experts
and
after
that
it
becomes
a
question
of
going
straight
ahead
great
waste
of
power
one
thing
is
certain
even
in
the
most
efficient
of
modern
aerial
motors
there
is
a
great
loss
of
power
between
the
two
points
of
production
and
effect
the
wright
outfit
which
is
admittedly
one
of
the
most
effective
in
use
takes
one
horsepower
of
force
for
the
raising
and
propulsion
of
each
pounds
of
weight
this
for
a
engine
would
give
a
maximum
lifting
capacity
of
pounds
it
is
doubtful
if
any
of
the
higher
rated
motors
have
greater
efficiency
as
an
motor
requires
more
fuel
to
operate
than
a
it
naturally
follows
that
it
is
more
expensive
to
run
than
the
smaller
motor
and
a
normal
increase
in
capacity
taking
actual
performances
as
a
criterion
is
lacking
in
other
words
what
is
the
sense
of
using
an
motor
when
one
of
cylinders
is
sufficient
what
the
propeller
does
much
of
the
efficiency
of
the
motor
is
due
to
the
form
and
gearing
of
the
propeller
here
again
as
in
other
vital
parts
of
mechanism
we
have
a
wide
divergence
of
opinion
as
to
the
best
form
a
fish
makes
progress
through
the
water
by
using
its
fins
and
tail
a
bird
makes
its
way
through
the
air
in
a
similar
manner
by
the
use
of
its
wings
and
tail
in
both
instances
the
motive
power
comes
from
the
body
of
the
fish
or

in
place
of
fins
or
wings
the
flying
machine
is
equipped
with
a
propeller
the
action
of
which
is
furnished
by
the
engine
fins
and
wings
have
been
tried
but
they
do
work
while
operating
on
the
same
general
principle
aerial
propellers
are
much
larger
than
those
used
on
boats
this
is
because
the
boat
propeller
has
a
denser
more
substantial
medium
to
work
in
water
and
consequently
can
get
a
better
hold
and
produce
more
propulsive
force
than
one
of
the
same
size
revolving
in
the
air
this
necessitates
the
aerial
propellers
being
much
larger
than
those
employed
for
marine
purposes
up
to
this
point
all
aviators
agree
but
as
to
the
best
form
most
of
them
differ
kinds
of
propellers
used
one
of
the
most
simple
is
that
used
by
curtiss
it
consists
of
two
blades
of
laminated
wood
each
blade
being
inches
wide
at
its
extreme
point
tapering
slightly
to
the
shaft
connection
these
blades
are
joined
at
the
engine
shaft
in
a
direct
line
the
propeller
has
a
pitch
of
feet
and
weighs
complete
less
than
pounds
the
length
from
end
to
end
of
the
two
blades
is
feet
wright
uses
two
wooden
propellers
in
the
rear
of
his
biplane
revolving
in
opposite
directions
each
propeller
is
bleriot
also
uses
a
wooden
propeller
but
it
is
placed
in
front
of
his
machine
the
blades
are
each
about
feet
long
and
have
an
acute
twist
uses
a
wooden
propeller
strikingly
similar
to
the
bleriot
on
the
antoinette
monoplane
with
which
good
records
have
been
made
the
propeller
consists
of
two
pieces
of
metal
joined
at
the
engine
shaft
in
front
and
with
the
concave
surfaces
facing
the
machine
the
propeller
on
the
voisin
biplane
is
also
of
metal
consisting
of
two
aluminum
blades
connected
by
a
forged
steel
arm
maximum
thrust
or
stress
exercise
of
the
greatest
force
is
the
object
sought
this
according
to
experts
is
best
obtained
with
a
large
propeller
diameter
and
reasonably
low
speed
the
diameter
is
the
distance
from
end
to
end
of
the
blades
which
on
the
largest
propellers
ranges
from
to
feet
the
larger
the
blade
surface
the
greater
will
be
the
volume
of
air
displaced
and
following
this
the
greater
will
be
the
impulse
which
forces
the
aeroplane
ahead
in
all
centrifugal
motion
there
is
more
or
less
tendency
to
disintegration
in
the
form
of
flying
off
from
the
center
and
the
larger
the
revolving
object
is
the
stronger
is
this
tendency
this
is
illustrated
in
the
many
instances
in
which
big
grindstones
and
have
burst
from
being
revolved
too
fast
to
have
a
propeller
break
apart
in
the
air
would
jeopardize
the
life
of
the
aviator
and
to
guard
against
this
it
has
been
found
best
to
make
its
revolving
action
comparatively
slow
besides
this
the
slow
motion
it
is
only
comparatively
slow
gives
the
atmosphere
a
chance
to
refill
the
area
disturbed
by
one
propeller
blade
and
thus
have
a
new
surface
for
the
next
blade
to
act
upon
placing
of
the
motor
as
on
other
points
aviators
differ
widely
in
their
ideas
as
to
the
proper
position
for
the
motor
wright
locates
his
on
the
lower
plane
midway
between
the
front
and
rear
edges
but
considerably
to
one
side
of
the
exact
center
he
then
the
engine
weight
by
placing
his
seat
far
enough
away
in
the
opposite
direction
to
preserve
the
center
of
gravity
this
leaves
a
space
in
the
center
between
the
motor
and
the
operator
in
which
a
passenger
may
be
carried
without
disturbing
the
equilibrium
bleriot
on
the
contrary
has
his
motor
directly
in
front
and
preserves
the
center
of
gravity
by
taking
his
seat
well
back
this
with
the
weight
of
the
aeroplane
acting
as
a
on
the
curtiss
machine
the
motor
is
in
the
rear
the
forward
seat
of
the
operator
and
weight
of
the
horizontal
rudder
and
damping
plane
in
front
equalizing
the
engine
weight
no
perfect
motor
as
yet
engine
makers
in
the
united
states
england
france
and
germany
are
all
seeking
to
produce
an
ideal
motor
for
aviation
purposes
many
of
the
productions
are
highly
creditable
but
it
may
be
truthfully
said
that
none
of
them
quite
fill
the
bill
as
regards
a
combination
of
the
minimum
of
weight
with
the
maximum
of
reliable
maintained
power
they
are
all
in
some
respects
improvements
upon
those
previously
in
use
but
the
great
end
sought
for
has
not
been
fully
attained
one
of
the
motors
thus
produced
was
made
by
the
french
firm
of
darracq
at
the
suggestion
of
santos
dumont
and
on
lines
laid
down
by
him
santos
dumont
wanted
a
horizontal
motor
capable
of
developing
horsepower
and
not
exceeding
pounds
per
horsepower
in
weight
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
the
ability
and
skill
of
the
darracq
people
or
of
their
desire
to
produce
a
motor
that
would
bring
new
credit
and
prominence
to
the
firm
neither
could
anything
radically
wrong
be
detected
in
the
plans
but
the
motor
in
at
least
one
important
requirement
fell
short
of
expectations
it
could
not
be
depended
upon
to
deliver
an
energy
of
horsepower
continuously
for
any
length
of
time
its
maximum
power
could
be
secured
only
in
spurts
this
tends
to
show
how
hard
it
is
to
produce
an
ideal
motor
for
aviation
purposes
santos
dumont
of
undoubted
skill
and
experience
as
an
aviator
outlined
definitely
what
he
wanted
one
of
the
greatest
designers
in
the
business
drew
the
plans
and
the
famous
house
of
darracq
bent
its
best
energies
to
the
production
but
the
desired
end
was
not
fully
attained
features
of
darracq
motor
horizontal
motors
were
practically
abandoned
some
time
ago
in
favor
of
the
vertical
type
but
santos
dumont
had
a
logical
reason
for
reverting
to
them
he
wanted
to
secure
a
lower
center
of
gravity
than
would
be
possible
with
a
vertical
engine
theoretically
his
idea
was
correct
as
the
horizontal
motor
lies
flat
and
therefore
offers
less
resistance
to
the
wind
but
it
did
not
work
out
as
desired
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
admitted
that
this
darracq
motor
is
a
marvel
of
ingenuity
and
exquisite
workmanship
the
two
cylinders
having
a
bore
of
inches
and
a
stroke
of
inches
are
machined
out
of
a
solid
bar
of
steel
until
their
weight
is
only
pounds
complete
the
head
is
separate
carrying
the
seatings
for
the
inlet
and
exhaust
valves
is
screwed
onto
the
cylinder
and
then
welded
in
position
a
copper
is
fitted
and
it
is
in
this
condition
that
the
weight
of
pounds
is
obtained
on
long
trips
especially
in
regions
where
gasolene
is
hard
to
get
the
weight
of
the
fuel
supply
is
an
important
feature
in
aviation
as
a
natural
consequence
flying
machine
operators
favor
the
motor
of
greatest
economy
in
gasolene
consumption
provided
it
gives
the
necessary
power
an
american
inventor
ramsey
by
name
is
working
on
a
motor
which
is
said
to
possess
great
possibilities
in
this
line
its
distinctive
features
include
a
connecting
rod
much
shorter
than
usual
and
a
crank
shaft
located
the
length
of
the
crank
from
the
central
axis
of
the
cylinder
this
has
the
effect
of
increasing
the
piston
stroke
and
also
of
increasing
the
proportion
of
the
crank
circle
during
which
effective
pressure
is
applied
to
the
crank
making
the
connecting
rod
shorter
and
leaving
the
crank
mechanism
the
same
would
introduce
excessive
cylinder
friction
this
ramsey
overcomes
by
the
location
of
his
crank
shaft
the
effect
of
the
long
piston
stroke
thus
secured
is
to
increase
the
expansion
of
the
gases
which
in
turn
increases
the
power
of
the
engine
without
increasing
the
amount
of
fuel
used
propeller
thrust
important
there
is
one
great
principle
in
flying
machine
propulsion
which
must
not
be
overlooked
no
matter
how
powerful
the
engine
may
be
unless
the
propeller
thrust
more
than
overcomes
the
wind
pressure
there
can
be
no
progress
forward
should
the
force
of
this
propeller
thrust
and
that
of
the
wind
pressure
be
equal
the
result
is
obvious
the
machine
is
at
a
so
far
as
forward
progress
is
concerned
and
is
deprived
of
the
essential
advancing
movement
speed
not
only
furnishes
sustentation
for
the
airship
but
adds
to
the
stability
of
the
machine
an
aeroplane
which
may
be
jerky
and
uncertain
in
its
movements
so
far
as
equilibrium
is
concerned
when
moving
at
a
slow
gait
will
readily
maintain
an
even
keel
when
the
speed
is
increased
designs
for
propeller
blades
it
is
the
object
of
all
men
who
design
propellers
to
obtain
the
maximum
of
thrust
with
the
minimum
expenditure
of
engine
energy
with
this
purpose
in
view
many
peculiar
forms
of
propeller
blades
have
been
evolved
in
theory
it
would
seem
that
the
best
effects
could
be
secured
with
blades
so
shaped
as
to
present
a
thin
or
cutting
edge
when
they
come
out
of
the
wind
and
then
at
the
climax
of
displacement
afford
a
maximum
of
surface
so
as
to
displace
as
much
air
as
possible
while
this
is
the
form
most
generally
favored
there
are
others
in
successful
operation
there
is
also
wide
difference
in
opinion
as
to
the
equipment
of
the
propeller
shaft
with
two
or
more
blades
some
aviators
use
two
and
some
four
all
have
more
or
less
success
as
a
mathematical
proposition
it
would
seem
that
four
blades
should
give
more
propulsive
force
than
two
but
here
again
comes
in
one
of
the
puzzles
of
aviation
as
this
result
is
not
always
obtained
difference
in
propeller
efficiency
that
there
is
a
great
difference
in
propeller
efficiency
is
made
readily
apparent
by
the
comparison
of
effects
produced
in
two
leading
makes
of
machines
the
wright
and
the
voisin
in
the
former
a
weight
of
from
to
pounds
is
sustained
and
advance
progress
made
at
the
rate
of
miles
an
hour
and
more
with
half
the
engine
speed
of
a
motor
this
would
be
a
sustaining
capacity
of
pounds
per
horsepower
but
the
actual
capacity
of
the
wright
machine
as
already
stated
is
pounds
per
horsepower
the
voisin
machine
with
aviator
weighs
about
pounds
and
is
operated
with
a
motor
allowing
it
the
same
speed
as
the
wright
we
find
that
with
double
the
engine
energy
the
lifting
capacity
is
only
pounds
per
horsepower
to
what
shall
we
charge
this
remarkable
difference
the
surface
of
the
planes
is
exactly
the
same
in
both
machines
so
there
is
no
advantage
in
the
matter
of
supporting
area
comparison
of
two
designs
on
the
wright
machine
two
wooden
propellers
of
two
blades
each
each
blade
having
a
decided
twist
are
used
as
one
horsepower
motor
drives
both
propellers
the
engine
energy
amounts
to
just
of
this
for
each
or
horsepower
and
this
energy
is
utilized
at
the
normal
engine
speed
on
the
voisin
a
radically
different
system
is
employed
here
we
have
one
metal
propeller
with
a
very
slight
twist
to
the
blade
surfaces
the
full
energy
of
a
motor
is
utilized
experts
fail
to
agree
why
should
there
be
such
a
marked
difference
in
the
results
obtained
who
knows
some
experts
maintain
that
it
is
because
there
are
two
propellers
on
the
wright
machine
and
only
one
on
the
voisin
and
consequently
double
the
propulsive
power
is
exerted
but
this
is
not
a
fair
deduction
unless
both
propellers
are
of
the
same
size
propulsive
power
depends
upon
the
amount
of
air
displaced
and
the
energy
put
into
the
thrust
which
displaces
the
air
other
experts
argue
that
the
difference
in
results
may
be
traced
to
the
difference
in
blade
design
especially
in
the
matter
of
twist
the
fact
is
that
propeller
results
depend
largely
upon
the
nature
of
the
aeroplanes
on
which
they
are
used
a
propeller
for
instance
which
gives
excellent
results
on
one
type
of
aeroplane
will
not
work
satisfactorily
on
another
there
are
some
features
however
which
may
be
safely
adopted
in
propeller
selection
these
are
as
extensive
a
diameter
as
possible
blade
area
to
per
cent
of
the
area
swept

rotation
slow
the

chapter
x
proper
dimensions
of
machines
in
laying
out
plans
for
a
flying
machine
the
first
thing
to
decide
upon
is
the
size
of
the
plane
surfaces
the
proportions
of
these
must
be
based
upon
the
load
to
be
carried
this
includes
the
total
weight
of
the
machine
and
equipment
and
also
the
operator
this
will
be
a
rather
difficult
problem
to
figure
out
exactly
but
practical
approximate
figures
may
be
reached
it
is
easy
to
get
at
the
weight
of
the
operator
motor
and
propeller
but
the
matter
of
determining
before
they
are
constructed
what
the
planes
rudders
auxiliaries
will
weigh
when
completed
is
an
intricate
proposition
the
best
way
is
to
take
the
dimensions
of
some
successful
machine
and
use
them
making
such
alterations
in
a
minor
way
as
you
may
desire
dimensions

leading

in
the
following
tables

be

thus
while
the
dimensions
of

of

machine
are
feet
spread

feet
in

the
depth
over
all
is
figuring
out
the
details
with
this
data
as
a
guide
it
should
be
comparatively
easy
to
decide
upon
the
dimensions
of
the
machine
required
in
arriving
at
the
maximum
lifting
capacity
the
weight
of
the
operator
must
be
added
assuming
this
to
average
pounds
the
method
of
procedure
would
be
as
follows
add
the
weight
of
the
operator
to
the
weight
of
the
complete
machine
the
new
wright
machine
complete
weighs
pounds
this
plus
the
weight
of
the
operator
gives
a
total
of
pounds
there
are
square
feet
of
supporting
surface
or
practically
one
square
foot
of
surface
area
to
each
two
pounds
of
load
there
are
some
machines
notably
the
bleriot
in
which
the
supporting
power
is
much
greater
in
this
latter
instance
we
find
a
surface
area
of
square
feet
carrying
a
load
of
plus
or
an
aggregate
of
pounds
this
is
the
equivalent
of
five
pounds
to
the
square
foot
this
ratio
is
phenomenally
large
and
should
not
be
taken
as
a
guide
by
amateurs
the
matter
of
passengers
these
deductions
are
based
on
each
machine
carrying
one
passenger
which
is
admittedly
the
limit
at
present
of
the
monoplanes
like
those
operated
for
purposes
by
and
bleriot
the
biplanes
however
have
a
capacity
and
this
adds
materially
to
the
proportion
of
their
power
as
compared
with
the
surface
area
in
the
following
statement
all
the
machines
are
figured
on
the
basis
curtiss
and
wright
have
carried
two
passengers
on
numerous
occasions
and
an
extra
pounds
should
therefore
be
added
to
the
total
weight
carried
which
would
materially
increase
the
capacity
even
with
the
load
the
limit
is
by
no
means
reached
but
as
experiments
have
gone
no
further
it
is
impossible
to
make
more
accurate
figures
average
proportions
of

it
will
be
interesting
before

to

out
the

to
make

with

the
fact
that
it
is
the
engine
power
which
keeps
the
machine
in
motion
and
that
it
is
only
while
in
motion
that
the
machine
will
remain
suspended
in
the
air
hence
to
attribute
the
support
solely
to
the
surface
area
is
erroneous
true
that
once
under
headway
the
planes
contribute
largely
to
the
sustaining
effect
and
are
absolutely
essential
in
aerial
navigation
the
motor
could
not
rise
without
them
still
when
it
comes
to
a
question
of
power
we
must
also
figure
on
the
engine
capacity
in
the
wright
machine
in
which
there
is
a
lifting
capacity
of
approximately
pounds
to
the
square
foot
of
surface
area
an
engine
of
only
horsepower
is
used
in
the
curtiss
which
has
a
lifting
capacity
of
pounds
per
square
foot
the
engine
is
of
horsepower
this
is
another
of
the
peculiarities
of
aerial
construction
and
navigation
here
we
have
a
gain
of
pound
in
capacity
with
an
expenditure
of
double
the
horsepower
it
is
this
feature
which
enables
curtiss
to
get
along
with
a
smaller
surface
area
of
supporting
planes
at
the
expense
of
a
big
increase
in
engine
power
proper
weight
of
machine
as
a
general
proposition
the
most
satisfactory
machine
for
amateur
purposes
will
be
found
to
be
one
with
a
total
power
of
about
pounds
deducting
pounds
as
the
weight
of
the
operator
this
will
leave
pounds
for
the
complete
machine
and
it
should
be
easy
to
construct
one
within
this
limit
this
implies
of
course
that
due
care
will
be
taken
to
eliminate
all
superfluous
weight
by
using
the
lightest
material
compatible
with
strength
and
safety
this
plan
will
admit
of
pounds
weight
in
the
frame
work
coverings
and
for
the
motor
propeller
which
will
be
ample
just
how
to
distribute
the
weight
of
the
planes
is
a
matter
which
must
be
left
to
the
ingenuity
of
the
builder
comparison
of
bird
power
there
is
an
interesting
study
in
the
accompanying
illustration
note
that
the
surface
area
of
the
albatross
is
much
smaller
than
that
of
the
vulture
although
the
wing
spread
is
about
the
same
despite
this
the
albatross
accomplishes
fully
as
much
in
the
way
of
flight
and
soaring
as
the
vulture
why
because
the
albaboss
is
quicker
and
more
powerful
in
action
it
is
the
application
of
this
same
principle
in
flying
machines
which
enables
those
of
great
speed
and
power
to
get
along
with
less
supporting
surface
than
those
of
slower
movement
measurements
of
curtiss
machine
some
idea
of
framework
proportion
may
be
had
from
the
following
description
of
the
curtiss
machine
the
main
planes
have
a
spread
width
of
feet
and
are
feet
deep
the
front
double
surface
horizontal
rudder
is
feet
with
an
area
of
square
feet
to
the
rear
of
the
main
planes
is
a
single
surface
horizontal
plane
feet
with
an
area
of
square
feet
in
connection
with
this
is
a
vertical
rudder
feet
square
two
movable
ailerons
or
balancing
planes
are
placed
at
the
extreme
ends
of
the
upper
planes
these
are
feet
and
have
a
combined
area
of
square
feet
there
is
also
a
triangular
shaped
vertical
steadying
surface
in
connection
with
the
front
rudder
thus
we
have
a
total
of
square
feet
but
as
the
official
figures
are
and
the
size
of
the
steadying
surface
is
unknown
we
must
take
it
for
granted
that
this
makes
up
the
difference
in
the
matter
of
proportion
the
horizontal
rudder
is
about
the
size
of
the
main
plane
counting
the
surface
area
of
only
one
plane
the
vertical

and
the
ailerons
chapter
xi
plane
and
rudder
control
having
constructed
and
equipped
your
machine
the
next
thing
is
to
decide
upon
the
method
of
controlling
the
various
rudders
and
auxiliary
planes
by
which
the
direction
and
equilibrium
and
ascending
and
descending
of
the
machine
are
governed
the
operator
must
be
in
position
to
shift
instantaneously
the
position
of
rudders
and
planes
and
also
to
control
the
action
of
the
motor
this
latter
is
supposed
to
work
automatically
and
as
a
general
thing
does
so
with
entire
satisfaction
but
there
are
times
when
the
supply
of
gasolene
must
be
regulated
and
similar
things
done
airship
navigation
calls
for
quick
action
and
for
this
reason
the
matter
of
control
is
an
important
one
it
is
more
than
important
it
is
vital
several
methods
of
control
some
aviators
use
a
steering
wheel
somewhat
after
the
style
of
that
used
in
automobiles
and
by
this
not
only
manipulate
the
rudder
planes
but
also
the
flow
of
gasolene
others
employ
foot
levers
and
still
others
like
the
wrights
depend
upon
hand
levers
curtiss
steers
his
aeroplane
by
means
of
a
wheel
but
secures
the
desired
stabilizing
effect
with
an
ingenious
jointed
this
is
so
arranged
that
by
leaning
toward
the
high
point
of
his
wing
planes
the
aeroplane
is
restored
to
an
even
keel
the
steering
post
of
the
wheel
is
movable
backward
and
forward
and
by
this
motion
elevation
is
obtained
the
wrights
for
some
time
used
two
hand
levers
one
to
steer
by
and
warp
the
flexible
tips
of
the
planes
the
other
to
secure
elevation
they
have
now
consolidated
all
the
functions
in
one
lever
bleriot
also
uses
the
single
lever
control
farman
employs
a
lever
to
actuate
the
rudders
but
manipulates
the
balancing
planes
by
foot
levers
uses
two
hand
levers
with
which
to
steer
and
elevate
but
manipulates
the
planes
by
means
of
an
attachment
to
the
back
of
his
outer
coat
connection
with
the
levers
no
matter
which
particular
method
is
employed
the
connection
between
the
levers
and
the
object
to
be
manipulated
is
almost
invariably
by
wire
for
instance
from
the
steering
levers
or
lever
two
wires
connect
with
opposite
sides
of
the
rudder
as
a
lever
is
moved
so
as
to
draw
in
the
wire
the
rudder
is
drawn
to
the
right
and
vice
versa
the
operation
is
exactly
the
same
as
in
steering
a
boat
it
is
the
same
way
in
changing
the
position
of
the
balancing
planes
a
movement
of
the
hands
or
feet
and
the
machine
has
changed
its
course
or
if
the
equilibrium
is
threatened
is
back
on
an
even
keel
simple
as
this
seems
it
calls
for
a
cool
head
quick
eye
and
steady
hand
the
least
hesitation
or
a
false
movement
and
both
aviator
and
craft
are
in
danger
which
method
is
best
it
would
be
a
bold
man
who
would
attempt
to
pick
out
any
one
of
these
methods
of
control
and
say
it
was
better
than
the
others
as
in
other
sections
of
aeroplane
mechanism
each
method
has
its
advocates
who
dwell
learnedly
upon
its
advantages
but
the
fact
remains
that
all
the
various
plans
work
well
and
give
satisfaction
what
the
novice
is
interested
in
knowing
is
how
the
control
is
effected
and
whether
he
has
become
proficient
enough
in
his
manipulation
of
it
to
be
absolutely
dependable
in
time
of
emergency
no
amateur
should
attempt
a
flight
alone
until
he
has
thoroughly
mastered
the
steering
and
plane
control
if
the
services
and
advice
of
an
experienced
aviator
are
not
to
be
had
the
novice
should
mount
his
machine
on
some
suitable
supports
so
it
will
be
well
clear
of
the
ground
and
getting
into
the
seat
proceed
to
make
himself
well
acquainted
with
the
operation
of
the
steering
wheel
and
levers
some
things
to
be
learned
he
will
soon
learn
that
certain
movements
of
the
steering
gear
produce
certain
effects
on
the
rudders
if
for
instance
his
machine
is
equipped
with
a
steering
wheel
he
will
find
that
turning
the
wheel
to
the
right
turns
the
aeroplane
in
the
same
direction
because
the
tiller
is
brought
around
to
the
left
in
the
same
way
he
will
learn
that
a
given
movement
of
the
lever
throws
the
forward
edge
of
the
main
plane
upward
and
that
the
machine
getting
the
impetus
of
the
wind
under
the
concave
surfaces
of
the
planes
will
ascend
in
the
same
way
it
will
quickly
become
apparent
to
him
that
an
opposite
movement
of
the
lever
will
produce
an
opposite
effect
the
forward
edges
of
the
planes
will
be
lowered
the
air
will
be
spilled
out
to
the
rear
and
the
machine
will
descend
the
time
expended
in
these
preliminary
lessons
will
be
well
spent
it
would
be
an
act
of
folly
to
attempt
to
actually
sail
the
craft
without
them
chapter
xii
how
to
use
the
machine
it
is
a
mistaken
idea
that
flying
machines
must
be
operated
at
extreme
altitudes
true
under
the
impetus
of
handsome
prizes
and
the
incentive
to
advance
scientific
knowledge
professional
aviators
have
ascended
to
considerable
heights
flights
at
from
to
feet
being
now
common
with
such
experts
as
farman
bleriot
latham
paulhan
wright
and
curtiss
the
altitude
record
at
this
time
is
about
feet
held
by
paulhan
one
of
the
instructions
given
by
experienced
aviators
to
pupils
and
for
which
they
insist
upon
implicit
obeyance
is
if
your
machine
gets
more
than
feet
high
or
comes
closer
to
the
ground
than
feet
descend
at
once
such
men
as
wright
and
curtiss
will
not
tolerate
a
violation
of
this
rule
if
their
instructions
are
not
strictly
complied
with
they
decline
to
give
the
offender
further
lessons
why
this
rule
prevails
there
is
good
reason
for
this
precaution
the
higher
the
altitude
the
more
rarefied
thinner
becomes
the
air
and
the
less
sustaining
power
it
has
consequently
the
more
difficult
it
becomes
to
keep
in
suspension
a
given
weight
when
sailing
within
feet
of
the
ground
sustentation
is
comparatively
easy
and
should
a
fall
occur
the
results
are
not
likely
to
be
serious
on
the
other
hand
sailing
too
near
the
ground
is
almost
as
objectionable
in
many
ways
as
getting
up
too
high
if
the
craft
is
navigated
too
close
to
the
ground
trees
shrubs
fences
and
other
obstructions
are
liable
to
be
encountered
there
is
also
the
handicap
of
contrary
air
currents
diverted
by
the
obstructions
referred
to
and
which
will
be
explained
more
fully
further
on
how
to
make
a
start
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
beginner
has
familiarized
himself
with
the
manipulation
of
the
machine
and
especially
the
control
mechanism
the
next
thing
in
order
is
an
actual
flight
it
is
probable
that
his
machine
will
be
equipped
with
a
wheeled
alighting
gear
as
the
skids
used
by
the
wrights
necessitate
the
use
of
a
special
starting
track
in
this
respect
the
wheeled
machine
is
much
easier
to
handle
so
far
as
novices
are
concerned
as
it
may
be
easily
rolled
to
the
trial
grounds
this
as
in
the
case
of
the
initial
experiments
should
be
a
clear
reasonably
level
place
free
from
trees
fences
rocks
and
similar
obstructions
with
which
there
may
be
danger
of
colliding
the
beginner
will
need
the
assistance
of
three
men
one
of
these
should
take
his
position
in
the
rear
of
the
machine
and
one
at
each
end
on
reaching
the
trial
ground
the
aviator
takes
his
seat
in
the
machine
and
while
the
men
at
the
ends
hold
it
steady
the
one
in
the
rear
assists
in
retaining
it
until
the
operator
is
ready
in
the
meantime
the
aviator
has
started
his
motor
like
the
glider
the
flying
machine
in
order
to
accomplish
the
desired
results
should
be
headed
into
the
wind
when
the
machine
rises
under
the
impulse
of
the
pushing
movement
and
assisted
by
the
motor
action
the
machine
will
gradually
rise
from
the
ground
provided
it
has
been
properly
proportioned
and
put
together
and
everything
is
in
working
order
this
is
the
time
when
the
aviator
requires
a
cool
head
at
a
modest
distance
from
the
ground
use
the
control
lever
to
bring
the
machine
on
a
horizontal
level
and
overcome
the
tendency
to
rise
the
exact
manipulation
of
this
lever
depends
upon
the
method
of
control
adopted
and
with
this
the
aviator
is
supposed
to
have
thoroughly
familiarized
himself
as
previously
advised
in
chapter
xi
it
is
at
this
juncture
that
the
operator
must
act
promptly
but
with
the
perfect
composure
begotten
of
confidence
one
of
the
great
drawbacks
in
aviation
by
novices
is
the
tendency
to
become
rattled
and
this
is
much
more
prevalent
than
one
might
suppose
even
among
men
who
under
other
conditions
are
cool
and
confident
in
their
actions
there
is
something
in
the
sensation
of
being
suddenly
lifted
from
the
ground
and
suspended
in
the
air
that
is
disconcerting
at
the
start
but
this
will
soon
wear
off
if
the
experimenter
will
keep
cool
a
few
successful
flights
no
matter
how
short
they
may
be
will
put
a
lot
of
confidence
into
him
make
your
flights
short
be
modest
in
your
initial
flights
do
attempt
to
match
the
records
of
experienced
men
who
have
devoted
years
to
mastering
the
details
of
aviation
paulhan
farman
bleriot
wright
curtiss
and
all
the
rest
of
them
began
and
practiced
for
years
in
the
manner
here
described
being
content
to
make
just
a
little
advancement
at
each
attempt
a
flight
of
feet
cleanly
and
safely
made
is
better
as
a
beginning
than
one
of
yards
full
of
bungling
mishaps
and
yet
these
latter
have
their
uses
provided
the
operator
is
of
a
discerning
mind
and
can
take
advantage
of
them
as
object
lessons
but
it
is
not
well
to
invite
them
they
will
occur
frequently
enough
under
the
most
favorable
conditions
and
it
is
best
to
have
them
come
later
when
the
feeling
of
trepidation
and
uncertainty
as
to
what
to
do
has
worn
off
above
all
do
attempt
to
fly
too
high
keep
within
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
ground
about
or
feet
this
advice
is
not
given
solely
to
lessen
the
risk
of
serious
accident
in
case
of
collapse
but
mainly
because
it
will
assist
to
instill
confidence
in
the
operator
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
learn
to
swim
in
shallow
water
but
the
knowledge
that
one
is
tempting
death
in
deep
water
begets
timidity
preserving
the
equilibrium
after
learning
how
to
start
and
stop
to
ascend
and
descend
the
next
thing
to
master
is
the
art
of
preserving
equilibrium
the
knack
of
keeping
the
machine
perfectly
level
in
the
air
on
an
even
keel
as
a
sailor
would
say
this
simile
is
particularly
appropriate
as
all
aviators
are
in
reality
sailors
and
much
more
daring
ones
than
those
who
course
the
seas
the
latter
are
in
craft
which
are
kept
afloat
by
the
buoyancy
of
the
water
whether
in
motion
or
otherwise
and
so
long
as
normal
conditions
prevail
will
not
sink
aviators
sail
the
air
in
craft
in
which
constant
motion
must
be
maintained
in
order
to
ensure
flotation
the
man
who
has
ridden
a
bicycle
or
motorcycle
around
curves
at
anything
like
high
speed
will
have
a
very
good
idea
as
to
the
principle
of
maintaining
equilibrium
in
an
airship
he
knows
that
in
rounding
curves
rapidly
there
is
a
marked
tendency
to
change
the
direction
of
the
motion
which
will
result
in
an
upset
unless
he
overcomes
it
by
an
inclination
of
his
body
in
an
opposite
direction
this
is
why
we
see
racers
lean
well
over
when
taking
the
curves
it
simply
must
be
done
to
preserve
the
equilibrium
and
avoid
a
spill
how
it
works
in
the
air
if
the
equilibrium
of
an
airship
is
disturbed
to
an
extent
which
completely
overcomes
the
center
of
gravity
it
falls
according
to
the
location
of
the
displacement
if
this
displacement
for
instance
is
at
either
end
the
apparatus
falls
endways
if
it
is
to
the
front
or
rear
the
fall
is
in
the
corresponding
direction
owing
to
uncertain
air
currents
the
air
is
continually
shifting
and
eddying
especially
within
a
hundred
feet
or
so
of
the
earth
the
equilibrium
of
an
airship
is
almost
constantly
being
disturbed
to
some
extent
even
if
this
disturbance
is
not
serious
enough
to
bring
on
a
fall
it
interferes
with
the
progress
of
the
machine
and
should
be
overcome
at
once
this
is
one
of
the
things
connected
with
aerial
navigation
which
calls
for
prompt
intelligent
action
frequently
when
the
displacement
is
very
slight
it
may
be
overcome
and
the
craft
immediately
righted
by
a
mere
shifting
of
the
body
take
for
illustration
a
case
in
which
the
extreme
right
end
of
the
machine
becomes
lowered
a
trifle
from
the
normal
level
it
is
possible
to
bring
it
back
into
proper
position
by
leaning
over
to
the
left
far
enough
to
shift
the
weight
to
the
point
the
same
holds
good
as
to
minor
front
or
rear
displacements
when
planes
must
be
used
there
are
other
displacements
however
and
these
are
the
most
frequent
which
can
be
only
overcome
by
manipulation
of
the
stabilizing
planes
the
method
of
procedure
depends
upon
the
form
of
machine
in
use
the
wright
machine
as
previously
explained
is
equipped
with
plane
ends
which
are
so
contrived
as
to
admit
of
their
being
warped
position
changed
by
means
of
the
lever
control
these
flexible
tip
planes
move
simultaneously
but
in
opposite
directions
as
those
on
one
end
rise
those
on
the
other
end
fall
below
the
level
of
the
main
plane
by
this
means
air
is
displaced
at
one
point
and
an
increased
amount
secured
in
another
this
may
seem
like
a
complicated
system
but
its
workings
are
simple
when
once
understood
it
is
by
the
manipulation
or
warping
of
these
flexible
tips
that
transverse
stability
is
maintained
and
any
tendency
to
displacement
endways
is
overcome
longitudinal
stability
is
governed
by
means
of
the
front
rudder
stabilizing
planes
of
some
form
are
a
feature
and
a
necessary
feature
on
all
flying
machines
but
the
methods
of
application
and
manipulation
vary
according
to
the
individual
ideas
of
the
inventors
they
all
tend
however
toward
the
same
end
the
keeping
of
the
machine
perfectly
level
when
being
navigated
in
the
air
when
to
make
a
flight
a
beginner
should
never
attempt
to
make
a
flight
when
a
strong
wind
is
blowing
the
fiercer
the
wind
the
more
likely
it
is
to
be
gusty
and
uncertain
and
the
more
difficult
it
will
be
to
control
the
machine
even
the
most
experienced
and
daring
of
aviators
find
there
is
a
limit
to
wind
speed
against
which
they
dare
not
compete
this
is
not
because
they
lack
courage
but
have
the
sense
to
realize
that
it
would
be
silly
and
useless
the
novice
will
find
a
comparatively
still
day
or
one
when
the
wind
is
blowing
at
not
to
exceed
miles
an
hour
the
best
for
his
experiments
the
machine
will
be
more
easily
controlled
the
trip
will
be
safer
and
also
cheaper
as
the
consumption
of
fuel
increases
with
the
speed

which
the
aeroplane
is
forced
chapter
xiii
peculiarities
of
airship
power
as
a
general
proposition
it
takes
much
more
power
to
propel
an
airship
a
given
number
of
miles
in
a
certain
time
than
it
does
an
automobile
carrying
a
far
heavier
load
automobiles
with
a
gross
load
of
pounds
and
equipped
with
engines
of
horsepower
have
travelled
considerable
distances
at
the
rate
of
miles
an
hour
this
is
an
equivalent
of
about
pounds
per
horsepower
for
an
average
modern
flying
machine
with
a
total
load
machine
and
passengers
of
pounds
and
equipped
with
a
engine
miles
an
hour
is
the
maximum
here
we
have
the
equivalent
of
exactly
pounds
per
horsepower
why
this
great
difference
no
less
an
authority
than
mr
octave
chanute
answers
the
question
in
a
plain
easily
understood
manner
he
says
in
the
case
of
an
automobile
the
ground
furnishes
a
stable
support
in
the
case
of
a
flying
machine
the
engine
must
furnish
the
support
and
also
velocity
by
which
the
apparatus
is
sustained
in
the
air
pressure
of
the
wind
air
pressure
is
a
big
factor
in
the
matter
of
aeroplane
horsepower
allowing
that
a
dead
calm
exists
a
body
moving
in
the
atmosphere
creates
more
or
less
resistance
the
faster
it
moves
the
greater
is
this
resistance
moving
at
the
rate
of
miles
an
hour
the
resistance
or
wind
pressure
is
approximately
pounds
to
the
square
foot
of
surface
presented
if
the
moving
object
is
advancing
at
a
right
angle
to
the
wind
the
following
table
will
give
the
horsepower
effect
of
the
resistance
per
square
foot
of
surface
at
various
speeds
horse
power
miles
per
hour
per
sq
foot
while
the
pressure
per
square
foot
at
miles
an
hour
is
only
horsepower
at
miles
less
than
double
the
speed
it
has
increased
to
horsepower
or
exactly
eight
times
as
much
in
other
words
the
pressure
of
the
wind
increases
with
the
square
of
the
velocity
wind
at
miles
an
hour
has
four
times
more
pressure
than
wind
at
miles
an
hour
how
to
determine
upon
power
this
element
of
air
resistance
must
be
taken
into
consideration
in
determining
the
engine
horsepower
required
when
the
machine
is
under
headway
sufficient
to
raise
it
from
the
ground
about
miles
an
hour
each
square
foot
of
surface
resistance
will
require
nearly
of
a
horsepower
to
overcome
the
wind
pressure
and
propel
the
machine
through
the
air
as
shown
in
the
table
the
ratio
of
power
required
increases
rapidly
as
the
speed
increases
until
at
miles
an
hour
approximately
horsepower
is
needed
in
a
machine
like
the
curtiss
the
area
of
surface
is
about
square
feet
on
the
basis
of
this
resistance
moving
the
machine
at
miles
an
hour
would
require
horsepower
this
computation
covers
only
the
machine
power
to
overcome
resistance
it
does
not
cover
the
power
exerted
in
propelling
the
machine
forward
after
the
air
pressure
is
overcome
to
meet
this
important
requirement
curtiss
finds
it
necessary
to
use
a
engine
of
this
power
as
has
been
already
stated
horsepower
is
consumed
in
meeting
the
wind
pressure
leaving
horsepower
for
the
purpose
of
making
progress
the
flying
machine
must
move
faster
than
the
air
to
which
it
is
opposed
unless
it
does
this
there
can
be
no
direct
progress
if
the
two
forces
are
equal
there
is
no
advancement
take
for
sake
of
illustration
a
case
in
which
an
aeroplane
which
has
developed
a
speed
of
miles
an
hour
meets
a
wind
velocity
of
equal
force
moving
in
an
opposite
direction
what
is
the
result
there
can
be
no
advance
because
it
is
a
contest
between
two
evenly
matched
forces
the
aeroplane
stands
still
the
only
way
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
is
for
the
operator
to
wait
for
more
favorable
conditions
or
bring
his
machine
to
the
ground
in
the
usual
manner
by
manipulation
of
the
control
system
take
another
case
an
aeroplane
capable
of
making
miles
an
hour
in
a
calm
is
met
by
a
head
wind
of
miles
an
hour
how
much
progress
does
the
aeroplane
make
obviously
it
is
miles
an
hour
over
the
ground
put
the
proposition
in
still
another
way
if
the
wind
is
blowing
harder
than
it
is
possible
for
the
engine
power
to
overcome
the
machine
will
be
forced
backward
wind
pressure
a
necessity
while
all
this
is
true
the
fact
remains
that
wind
pressure
up
to
a
certain
stage
is
an
absolute
necessity
in
aerial
navigation
the
atmosphere
itself
has
very
little
real
supporting
power
especially
if
inactive
if
a
body
heavier
than
air
is
to
remain
afloat
it
must
move
rapidly
while
in
suspension
one
of
the
best
illustrations
of
this
is
to
be
found
in
skating
over
thin
ice
every
school
boy
knows
that
if
he
moves
with
speed
he
may
skate
or
glide
in
safety
across
a
thin
sheet
of
ice
that
would
not
begin
to
bear
his
weight
if
he
were
standing
still
exactly
the
same
proposition
obtains
in
the
case
of
the
flying
machine
the
reason
why
the
support
of
the
machine
becomes
easier
as
the
speed
increases
is
that
the
sustaining
power
of
the
atmosphere
increases
with
the
resistance
and
the
speed
with
which
the
object
is
moving
increases
this
resistance
with
a
velocity
of
miles
an
hour
the
weight
of
the
machine
is
practically
reduced
by
pounds
thus
if
under
a
condition
of
absolute
calm
it
were
possible
to
sustain
a
weight
of
pounds
the
same
atmosphere
would
sustain
a
weight
of
pounds
moving
at
a
speed
of
miles
an
hour
this
sustaining
power
increases
rapidly
as
the
speed
increases
while
at
miles
the
sustaining
power
is
figured
at
pounds
at
miles
it
is
four
times
as
great
or
pounds
supporting
area
of
birds
one
of
the
things
which
all
producing
aviators
seek
to
copy
is
the
motive
power
of
birds
particularly
in
their
relation
to
the
area
of
support
close
investigation
has
established
the
fact
that
the
larger
the
bird
the
less
is
the
relative
area
of
support
required
to
secure
a
given
result
this
is
shown
in
the
following
table
supporting
weight
surface
horse

lbs
in
sq

per

pigeon
wild
goose
buzzard
condor
so
far
as
known
the
condor
is
the
largest
of
modern
birds
it
has
a
wing
stretch
of
feet
from
tip
to
tip
a
supporting
area
of
about
square
feet
and
weighs
pounds
it
is
capable
of
exerting
perhaps
horsepower
these
figures
are
of
course
approximate
comparing
the
condor
with
the
buzzard
with
a
wing
stretch
of
feet
supporting
area
of
square
feet
and
a
little
over
horsepower
it
may
be
seen
that
broadly
speaking
the
larger
the
bird
the
less
surface
area
relatively
is
needed
for
its
support
in
the
air
comparison
with
aeroplanes
if
we
compare
the
bird
figures
with
those
made
possible
by
the
development
of
the
aeroplane
it
will
be
readily
seen
that
man
has
made
a
wonderful
advance
in
imitating
the
results
produced
by
nature
here
are
the

bleriot
antoinette
curtiss
wright
farman
voisin
while
the
average
supporting
surface
is
in
favor
of
the
aeroplane
this
is
more
than
overbalanced
by
the
greater
amount
of
horsepower
required
for
the
weight
lifted
the
average
supporting
surface
in
birds
is
about
of
a
square
foot
per
pound
in
the
average
aeroplane
it
is
about
square
foot
per
pound
on
the
other
hand
the
average
aeroplane
has
a
lifting
capacity
of
pounds
per
horsepower
while
the
buzzard
for
instance
lifts
pounds
with
of
a
horsepower
if
the
wright
machine
which
has
a
lifting
power
of
pounds
per
horsepower
should
be
alone
considered
the
showing
would
be
much
more
favorable
to
the
aeroplane
but
it
would
not
be
a
fair
comparison
more
surface
less
power
broadly
speaking
the
larger
the
supporting
area
the
less
will
be
the
power
required
wright
by
the
use
of
square
feet
of
supporting
surface
gets
along
with
an
engine
of
horsepower
curtiss
who
uses
only
square
feet
of
surface
finds
an
engine
of
horsepower
is
needed
other
things
such
as
frame
being
equal
it
stands
to
reason
that
a
reduction
in
the
area
of
supporting
surface
will
correspondingly
reduce
the
weight
of
the
machine
thus
we
have
the
curtiss
machine
with
its
square
feet
of
surface
weighing
only
pounds
without
operator
but
requiring
double
the
horsepower
of
the
wright
machine
with
square
feet
of
surface
and
weighing
pounds
this
demonstrates
in
a
forceful
way
the
proposition
that
the
larger
the
surface
the
less
power
will
be
needed
but
there
is
a
limit
on
account
of
its
bulk
and
awkwardness
in
handling
beyond
which
the
surface
area
can
not
be
enlarged
otherwise
it
might
be
possible
to
equip
and
operate
aeroplanes
satisfactorily
with
engines
of
horsepower
or
even
less
the
fuel
consumption
problem
fuel
consumption
is
a
prime
factor
in
the
production
of
engine
power
the
veriest
mechanical
tyro
knows
in
a
general
way
that
the
more
power
is
secured
the
more
fuel
must
be
consumed
allowing
that
there
is
no
difference
in
the
qualities
of
the
material
used
but
few
of
us
understand
just
what
the
ratio
of
increase
is
or
how
it
is
caused
this
proposition
is
one
of
keen
interest
in
connection
with
aviation
let
us
cite
a
problem
which
will
illustrate
the
point
quoted
allowing
that
it
takes
a
given
amount
of
gasolene
to
propel
a
flying
machine
a
given
distance
half
the
way
with
the
wind
and
half
against
it
the
wind
blowing
at
the
speed
of
the
machine
what
will
be
the
increase
in
fuel
consumption
increase
of
thirty
per
cent
on
the
face
of
it
there
would
seem
to
be
no
call
for
an
increase
as
the
resistance
met
when
going
against
the
wind
is
apparently
offset
by
the
propulsive
force
of
the
wind
when
the
machine
is
travelling
with
it
this
however
is
called
faulty
reasoning
the
increase
in
fuel
consumption
as
figured
by
lanchester
of
the
royal
society
of
arts
will
be
fully
per
cent
over
the
amount
required
for
a
similar
operation
of
the
machine
in
still
air
if
the
journey
should
be
made
at
right
angles
to
the
wind
under
the
same
conditions
the
increase
would
be
per
cent
in
other
words
lanchester
maintains
that
the
work
done
by
the
motor
in
making
headway
against
the
wind
for
a
certain
distance
calls
for
more
engine
energy
and
consequently
more
fuel
by
per
cent
than
is
saved
by
the
helping
force
of
the
wind
on
the
return
journey
chapter
xiv
about
wind
currents
etc
one
of
the
first
difficulties
which
the
novice
will
encounter
is
the
uncertainty
of
the
wind
currents
with
a
low
velocity
the
wind
some
distance
away
from
the
ground
is
ordinarily
steady
as
the
velocity
increases
however
the
wind
generally
becomes
gusty
and
fitful
in
its
action
this
it
should
be
remembered
does
not
refer
to
the
velocity
of
the
machine
but
to
that
of
the
air
itself
in
this
connection
arthur
atherholt
president
of
the
aero
club
of
pennsylvania
in
addressing
the
boston
society
of
scientific
research
said
probably
the
whirlpools
of
niagara
contain
no
more
erratic
currents
than
the
strata
of
air
which
is
now
immediately
above
us
a
fact
hard
to
realize
on
account
of
its
invisibility
changes
in
wind
currents
while
atherholt
experience
has
been
mainly
with
balloons
it
is
all
the
more
valuable
on
this
account
as
the
balloons
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
their
varying
directions
afforded
an
indisputable
guide
as
to
the
changing
course
of
the
air
currents
in
speaking
of
this
he
said
in
the
many
trips
taken
varying
in
distance
traversed
from
to
miles
it
was
never
possible
except
in
one
instance
to
maintain
a
straight
course
these
uncertain
currents
were
most
noticeable
in
the
race
from
louis
in
of
the
nine
aerostats
competing
in
that
event
eight
covered
a
more
or
less
direct
course
due
east
and
southeast
whereas
the
writer
with
major
henry
hersey
first
started
northwest
then
north
northeast
east
east
by
south
and
when
over
the
center
of
lake
erie
were
again
blown
northwest
notwithstanding
that
more
favorable
winds
were
sought
for
at
altitudes
varying
from
to
meters
necessitating
a
finish
in
canada
nearly
northeast
of
the
starting
point
these
nine
balloons
making
landings
extending
from
lake
ontario
canada
to
virginia
all
started
from
one
point
within
the
same
hour
the
single
exception
to
these
roving
currents
occurred
on
october
of
last
year
when
starting
from
philadelphia
the
wind
shifted
more
than
eight
degrees
the
greatest
variation
being
at
the
lowest
altitudes
yet
at
no
time
was
a
height
of
over
a
mile
reached
throughout
the
entire
day
the
sky
was
overcast
with
a
thermometer
varying
from
degrees
at
feet
to
degrees
fahrenheit
at
feet
at
which
altitude
the
wind
had
a
velocity
of
miles
an
hour
in
clouds
of
a
nature
a
landing
finally
being
made
near
tannersville
new
york
in
the
catskill
mountains
after
a
voyage
of
five
and
hours
i
have
no
knowledge
of
a
recorded
trip
of
this
distance
and
duration
maintained
in
practically
a
straight
line
from
start
to
finish
this
wind
disturbance
is
more
noticeable
and
more
difficult
to
contend
with
in
a
balloon
than
in
a
flying
machine
owing
to
the
bulk
and
unwieldy
character
of
the
former
at
the
same
time
it
is
not
conducive
to
pleasant
safe
or
satisfactory
in
an
aeroplane
this
is
not
stated
with
the
purpose
of
discouraging
aviation
but
merely
that
the
operator
may
know
what
to
expect
and
be
prepared
to
meet
it
not
only
does
the
wind
change
its
horizontal
course
abruptly
and
without
notice
but
it
also
shifts
in
a
vertical
direction
one
second

no
man
has
as
yet
fathomed
the
why
and
wherefore
of
this
erratic
action
it
is
only
known
that
it
exists
the
most
stable
currents
will
be
found
from
to
feet
from
the
earth
provided
the
wind
is
not
diverted
by
such
objects
as
trees
rocks
etc
that
there
are
equally
stable
currents
higher
up
is
true
but
they
are
generally
to
be
found
at
excessive
altitudes
how
a
bird
meets
currents
observe
a
bird
in
action
on
a
windy
day
and
you
will
find
it
continually
changing
the
position
of
its
wings
this
is
done
to
meet
the
varying
gusts
and
eddies
of
the
air
so
that
sustentation
may
be
maintained
and
headway
made
one
second
the
bird
is
bending
its
wings
altering
the
angle
of
incidence
the
next
it
is
lifting
or
depressing
one
wing
at
a
time
still
again
it
will
extend
one
wing
tip
in
advance
of
the
other
or
be
spreading
or
folding
lowering
or
raising
its
tail
all
these
motions
have
a
meaning
a
purpose
they
assist
the
bird
in
preserving
its
equilibrium
without
them
the
bird
would
be
just
as
helpless
in
the
air
as
a
human
being
and
could
not
remain
afloat
when
the
wind
is
still
or
comparatively
so
a
bird
having
secured
the
desired
altitude
by
flight
at
an
angle
may
sail
or
soar
with
no
wing
action
beyond
an
occasional
stroke
when
it
desires
to
advance
but
in
a
gusty
uncertain
wind
it
must
use
its
wings
or
alight
somewhere
trying
to
imitate
the
bird
writing
in
william
white
says
the
bird
flight
suggests
a
number
of
ways
in
which
the
equilibrium
of
a
mechanical
bird
may
be
controlled
each
of
these
methods
of
control
may
be
effected
by
several
different
forms
of
mechanism
placing
the
two
wings
of
an
aeroplane
at
an
angle
of
three
to
five
degrees
to
each
other
is
perhaps
the
oldest
way
of
securing
lateral
balance
this
way
readily
occurs
to
anyone
who
watches
a
sea
gull
soaring
the
theory
of
the
dihedral
angle
is
that
when
one
wing
is
lifted
by
a
gust
of
wind
the
air
is
spilled
from
under
it
while
the
other
wing
being
correspondingly
depressed
presents
a
greater
resistance
to
the
gust
and
is
lifted
restoring
the
balance
a
fixed
angle
of
three
to
five
degrees
however
will
only
be
sufficient
for
very
light
puffs
of
wind
and
to
mount
the
wings
so
that
the
whole
wing
may
be
moved
to
change
the
dihedral
angle
presents
mechanical
difficulties
which
would
be
better
avoided
the
objection
of
mechanical
impracticability
applies
to
any
plan
to
preserve
the
balance
by
shifting
weight
or
ballast
the
center
of
gravity
should
be
lower
than
the
center
of
the
supporting
surfaces
but
can
not
be
made
much
lower
it
is
a
common
mistake
to
assume
that
complete
stability
will
be
secured
by
hanging
the
center
of
gravity
very
low
on
the
principle
of
the
parachute
an
aeroplane
depends
upon
rapid
horizontal
motion
for
its
support
and
if
the
center
of
gravity
be
far
below
the
center
of
support
every
change
of
speed
or
wind
pressure
will
cause
the
machine
to
turn
about
its
center
of
gravity
pitching
forward
and
backward
dangerously
preserving
longitudinal
balance
the
birds
maintain
longitudinal
or
fore
and
aft
balance
by
elevating
or
depressing
their
tails
whether
this
action
is
secured
in
an
aeroplane
by
means
of
a
horizontal
rudder
placed
in
the
rear
or
by
deflecting
planes
placed
in
front
of
the
main
planes
the
principle
is
evidently
the
same
a
horizontal
rudder
placed
well
to
the
rear
as
in
the
antoinette
bleriot
or
monoplanes
will
be
very
much
safer
and
steadier
than
the
deflecting
planes
in
front
as
in
the
wright
or
curtiss
biplanes
but
not
so
sensitive
or
prompt
in
action
the
natural
fore
and
aft
stability
is
very
much
strengthened
by
placing
the
load
well
forward
the
center
of
gravity
near
the
front
and
a
tail
or
rudder
streaming
to
the
rear
secures
stability
as
an
arrow
is
balanced
by
the
head
and
feathering
the
adoption
of
this
principle
makes
it
almost
impossible
for
the
aeroplane
to
turn
over
the
matter
of
lateral
balance
all
successful
aeroplanes
thus
far
have
maintained
lateral
balance
by
the
principle
of
changing
the
angle
of
incidence
of
the
wings
other
ways
of
maintaining
the
lateral
balance
suggested
by
observation
of
the
flight
of
birds
are
extending
the
wing
tips
and
spilling
the
air
through
the
pinions
or
what
is
the
same
thing
varying
the
area
of
the
wings
at
their
extremities
extending
the
wing
tips
seems
to
be
a
simple
and
effective
solution
of
the
problem
the
tips
may
be
made
to
swing
outward
upon
a
vertical
axis
placed
at
the
front
edge
of
the
main
planes
or
they
may
be
hinged
to
the
ends
of
the
main
plane
so
as
to
be
elevated
or
depressed
through
suitable
connections
by
the
aviator
or
they
may
be
supported
from
a
horizontal
axis
parallel
with
the
ends
of
the
main
planes
so
that
they
may
swing
outward
the
aviator
controlling
both
tips
through
one
lever
so
that
as
one
tip
is
extended
the
other
is
retracted
the
elastic
wing
pinions
of
a
bird
bend
easily
before
the
wind
permitting
the
gusts
to
glance
off
but
presenting
always
an
even
and
efficient
curvature
to
the
steady
currents
of
the
air
high
winds
threaten
stability
to
ensure
perfect
stability
without
control
either
human
or
automatic
it
is
asserted
that
the
aeroplane
must
move
faster
than
the
wind
is
blowing
so
long
as
the
wind
is
blowing
at
the
rate
of
miles
an
hour
and
the
machine
is
traveling
or
more
there
will
be
little
trouble
as
regards
equilibrium
so
far
as
wind
disturbance
goes
provided
the
wind
blows
evenly
and
does
not
come
in
gusts
or
eddying
currents
but
when
conditions
are
reversed
when
the
machine
travels
only
miles
an
hour
and
the
wind
blows
at
the
rate
of
look
out
for
loss
of
equilibrium
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
this
is
that
high
winds
are
rarely
steady
they
seldom
blow
for
any
length
of
time
at
the
same
speed
they
are
usually
gusty
the
gusts
being
a
momentary
movement
at
a
higher
speed
tornadic
gusts
are
also
formed
by
the
meeting
of
two
opposing
currents
causing
a
whirling
motion
which
makes
stability
uncertain
besides
it
is
not
unusual
for
wind
of
high
speed
to
suddenly
change
its
direction
without
warning
trouble
with
vertical
columns
vertical
currents
columns
of
ascending
air
are
frequently
encountered
in
unexpected
places
and
have
more
or
less
tendency
according
to
their
strength
to
make
it
difficult
to
keep
the
machine
within
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
ground
these
vertical
currents
are
most
generally
noticeable
in
the
vicinity
of
steep
cliffs
or
deep
ravines
in
such
instances
they
are
usually
of
considerable
strength
being
caused
by
the
deflection
of
strong
winds
blowing
against
the
face
of
the
cliffs
this
deflection
exerts
a
back
pressure
which
is
felt
quite
a
distance
away
from
the
point
of
origin
so
that
the
vertical
current
exerts
an
influence
in
forcing
the
machine
upward
long
before
the
cliff
is
reached
chapter
xv
the
element
of
danger
that
there
is
an
element
of
danger
in
aviation
is
undeniable
but
it
is
nowhere
so
great
as
the
public
imagines
men
are
killed
and
injured
in
the
operation
of
flying
machines
just
as
they
are
killed
and
injured
in
the
operation
of
railways
considering
the
character
of
aviation
the
percentage
of
casualties
is
surprisingly
small
this
is
because
the
results
following
a
collapse
in
the
air
are
very
much
different
from
what
might
be
imagined
instead
of
dropping
to
the
ground
like
a
bullet
an
aeroplane
under
ordinary
conditions
will
when
anything
goes
wrong
sail
gently
downward
like
a
parachute
particularly
if
the
operator
is
and
nervy
enough
to
so
manipulate
the
apparatus
as
to
preserve
its
equilibrium
and
keep
the
machine
on
an
even
keel
two
fields
of
safety
at
least
one
prominent
aviator
has
declared
that
there
are
two
fields
of
safety
one
close
to
the
ground
and
the
other
well
up
in
the
air
in
the
the
fall
will
be
a
slight
one
with
little
chance
of
the
operator
being
seriously
hurt
from
the
field
of
high
altitude
the
the
descent
will
be
gradual
as
a
rule
the
planes
of
the
machine
serving
to
break
the
force
of
the
fall
with
a
operator
in
control
the
aeroplane
may
be
even
guided
at
an
angle
about
to
in
its
descent
so
as
to
touch
the
ground
with
a
gliding
motion
and
with
a
minimum
of
impact
such
an
experience
of
course
is
far
from
pleasant
but
it
is
by
no
means
so
dangerous
as
might
appear
there
is
more
real
danger
in
falling
from
an
elevation
of
or
feet
than
there
is
from
feet
as
in
the
former
case
there
is
no
chance
for
the
machine
to
serve
as
a
parachute
its
contact
with
the
ground
comes
too
quickly
lesson
in
recent
accidents
among
the
more
recent
fatalities
in
aviation
are
the
deaths
of
antonio
fernandez
and
leon
delagrange
the
former
was
thrown
to
the
ground
by
a
sudden
stoppage
of
his
motor
the
entire
machine
seeming
to
collapse
it
is
evident
there
were
radical
defects
not
only
in
the
motor
but
in
the
aeroplane
framework
as
well
at
the
time
of
the
stoppage
it
is
estimated
that
fernandez
was
up
about
feet
but
the
machine
got
no
opportunity
to
exert
a
parachute
effect
as
it
broke
up
immediately
this
would
indicate
a
fatal
weakness
in
the
structure
which
under
proper
testing
could
probably
have
been
detected
before
it
was
used
in
flight
it
is
hard
to
say
it
but
delagrange
appears
to
have
been
culpable
to
great
degree
in
overloading
his
machine
with
a
motor
equipment
much
heavier
than
it
was
designed
to
sustain
he
was
feet
up
in
the
air
when
the
collapse
occurred
resulting
in
his
death
as
in
the
case
of
fernandez
precaution
would
doubtless
have
prevented
the
fatality
aviation
not
extra
hazardous
all
told
there
have
been
up
to
the
time
of
this
writing
april
just
five
fatalities
in
the
history
of
aviation
this
is
surprisingly
low
when
the
nature
of
the
experiments
and
the
fact
that
most
of
the
operators
were
far
from
having
extended
experience
is
taken
into
consideration
men
like
the
wrights
curtiss
bleriot
farman
paulhan
and
others
are
now
experts
but
there
was
a
time
and
it
was
not
long
ago
when
they
were
unskilled
that
they
with
numerous
others
less
widely
known
should
have
come
safely
through
their
many
experiments
would
seem
to
disprove
the
prevailing
idea
that
aviation
is
an
extra
hazardous
pursuit
in
the
hands
of
careful
nervy
men
the
sailing
of
an
airship
should
be
no
more
hazardous
than
the
sailing
of
a
yacht
a
vessel
captain
with
common
sense
will
not
go
to
sea
in
a
storm
or
navigate
a
weak
unseaworthy
craft
neither
should
an
aviator
attempt
to
sail
when
the
wind
is
high
and
gusty
nor
with
a
machine
which
has
not
been
thoroughly
tested
and
found
to
be
strong
and
safe
safer
than
railroading
statistics
show
that
some
people
are
killed
and
injured
every
year
on
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
come
to
think
it
over
it
is
small
wonder
that
the
list
of
fatalities
is
so
large
trains
are
run
at
high
speeds
dashing
over
crossings
at
which
collisions
are
liable
to
occur
and
over
bridges
which
often
collapse
or
are
swept
away
by
floods
still
while
the
number
of
casualties
is
large
the
actual
percentage
is
small
considering
the
immense
number
of
people
involved
it
is
so
in
aviation
the
number
of
casualties
is
remarkably
small
in
comparison
with
the
number
of
flights
made
in
the
hands
of
competent
men
the
sailing
of
an
airship
should
be
and
is
freer
from
risk
of
accident
than
the
running
of
a
railway
train
there
are
no
rails
to
spread
or
break
no
bridges
to
collapse
no
crossings
at
which
collisions
may
occur
no
chance
for
some
sleepy
or
overworked
employee
to
misunderstand
the
dispatcher
orders
and
cause
a
wreck
two
main
causes
of
trouble
the
two
main
causes
of
trouble
in
an
airship
leading
to
disaster
may
be
attributed
to
the
stoppage
of
the
motor
and
the
aviator
becoming
rattled
so
that
he
loses
control
of
his
machine
modern
ingenuity
is
fast
developing
motors
that
almost
daily
become
more
and
more
reliable
and
experience
is
making
aviators
more
and
more
in
their
ability
to
act
wisely
and
promptly
in
cases
of
emergency
besides
this
a
satisfactory
system
of
automatic
control
is
in
a
fair
way
of
being
perfected
occasionally
even
the
most
experienced
and
competent
of
men
in
all
callings
become
careless
and
by
foolish
action
invite
disaster
this
is
true
of
aviators
the
same
as
it
is
of
railroaders
men
who
work
in
dynamite
mills
etc
but
in
nearly
every
instance
the
responsibility
rests
with
the
individual
not
with
the
system
there
are
some
men
unfitted
by
nature
for
aviation
just
as
there
are
others
unfitted
to
be
railway
engineers
chapter

radical
changes
being
made
changes
many
of
them
extremely
radical
in
their
nature
are
continually
being
made
by
prominent
aviators
and
particularly
those
who
have
won
the
greatest
amount
of
success
wonderful
as
the
results
have
been
few
of
the
aviators
are
really
satisfied
their
successes
have
merely
spurred
them
on
to
new
endeavors
the
ultimate
end
being
the
development
of
an
absolutely
perfect
aircraft
among
the
men
who
have
been
thus
experimenting
are
the
wright
brothers
who
last
year
brought
out
a
craft
totally
different
as
regards
proportions
and
weight
from
the
one
used
the
preceding
year
one
marked
result
was
a
gain
of
about
miles
an
hour
in
speed
dimensions
of
machine
the
model
aeroplane
was
by
feet
over
all
the
carrying
surfaces
that
is
the
two
aerocurves
were
by
feet
having
a
parabolical
curve
of
one
in
twelve
with
about
square
feet
of
surface
in
the
rudders
the
total
surface
given
was
about
square
feet
the
engine
which
is
the
invention
of
the
wright
brothers
weighed
approximately
pounds
and
gave
about
horsepower
at
revolutions
per
minute
the
total
weight
of
the
aeroplane
exclusive
of
passenger
but
inclusive
of
engine
was
about
pounds
this
result
showed
a
lift
of
a
fraction
over
pounds
to
the
square
foot
of
carrying
surface
the
speed
desired
was
miles
an
hour
but
the
machine
was
found
to
make
only
a
scant
miles
an
hour
the
upright
struts
were
about
thick
the
skids
by
inches
thick
dimensions
of
machine
the
aeroplane
was
built
primarily
for
greater
speed
and
relatively
heavier
to
be
less
at
the
mercy
of
the
wind
this
result
was
obtained
as
follows
the
aerocurves
or
carrying
surfaces
were
reduced
in
dimensions
from
by
feet
to
by
feet
the
curve
remaining
the
same
one
in
twelve
the
upright
struts
were
cut
from
inch
to
inch
and
the
skids
from
two
and
by
one
and
to
two
and
by
one
and
inches
this
result
shows
that
there
were
some
square
feet
of
carrying
surface
missing
over
that
of
last
year
model
and
some
pounds
loss
of
weight
relatively
though
the
model
aeroplane
while
actually
pounds
lighter
is
really
some
pounds
heavier
in
the
air
than
the
model
owing
to
the
lesser
square
feet
of
carrying
surface
some
of
the
results
obtained
reducing
the
carrying
surfaces
from
to
feet
gave
two
results
first
less
carrying
capacity
and
second
less
resistance
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
extent
of
the
parabolic
curve
in
the
carrying
surfaces
was
shortened
the
resistance
is
the
retardance
the
aeroplane
meets
in
passing
through
the
air
and
is
counted
in
square
feet
in
the
model
the
curve
being
one
in
twelve
and
feet
deep
gave
inches
of
resistance
the
plane
being
feet
spread
gave
inches
by
feet
or
square
feet
of
resistance
increasing
this
figure
by
a
like
amount
for
each
plane
and
adding
approximately
square
feet
for
struts
skids
and
wiring
we
have
a
total
of
approximately
square
feet
of
surface
for
resistance
in
the
aeroplane
shortening
the
curve
inches
at
the

of
the
curve
took
off
inch
of

shortening
the

took

add
to

the
total
of

curve
surface
and
about
square

resistance
and
we
have
a
grand
total
of
approximately
square

of
less
resistance
over
the
model
changes
in
engine
action
the
engine
used
in
was
the
same
one
used
in
though
some
minor
changes
were
made
as
improvements
for
instance
a
make
and
break
spark
was
used
and
a
instead
of
a
magneto
was
used
this
increased
the
engine
revolutions
per
minute
from
to
and
the
propeller
revolutions
per
minute
from
to
giving
a
propeller
thrust
of
approximately
foot
pounds
instead
of
as
was
had
last
year
more
speed
and
same
capacity
one
unsatisfactory
feature
of
the
model
over
that
of
apparently
was
the
lack
of
inherent
lateral
stability
this
was
caused
by
the
lesser
surface
and
lesser
extent
of
curvatures
at
the
portions
of
the
aeroplane
which
were
warped
this
defect
did
not
show
so
plainly
after
orville
wright
had
become
fully
proficient
in
the
handling
of
the
new
machine
and
with
skillful
management
the
model
aeroplane
will
be
just
as
safe
and
secure
as
the
other
though
it
will
take
a
little
more
practice
to
get
that
same
degree
of
skill
to
sum
up
the
aeroplane
used
in
was
pounds
lighter
but
really
about
pounds
heavier
in
the
air
had
less
resistance
and
greater
propeller
thrust
the
speed
was
increased
from
about
miles
per
hour
to
miles
per
hour
the
lifting
capacity
remained
about
the
same
about
pounds
capacity
with
the
machine
in
this
respect
the
loss
of
carrying
surface
was
compensated
for
by
the
increased
speed
during
the
first
few
flights
it
was
plainly
demonstrated
that
it
would
need
the
highest
skill
to
properly
handle
the
aeroplane
as
first
one
end
and
then
the
other
would
dip
and
strike
the
ground
and
either
tear
the
canvas
or
slew
the
aeroplane
around
and
break
a
skid
wrights
adopt
wheeled
gears
in
still
another
important
respect
the
wrights
so
far
as
the
output
of
one
of
their
companies
goes
have
made
a
radical
change
all
the
aeroplanes
turned
out
by
the
deutsch
wright
gesellschaft
according
to
the
german
publication
will
hereafter
be
equipped
with
wheeled
running
gears
and
tails
the
plan
of
this
new
machine
is
shown
in
the
illustration
on
page
the
wheels
are
three
in
number
and
are
attached
one
to
each
of
the
two
skids
just
under
the
front
edge
of
the
planes
and
one
forward
of
these
attached
to
a
it
is
asserted
that
with
these
wheels
the
teaching
of
purchasers
to
operate
the
machines
is
much
simplified
as
the
beginners
can
make
short
flights
on
their
own
account
without
using
the
starting
derrick
this
is
a
big
concession
for
the
wrights
to
make
as
they
have
hitherto
adhered
stoutly
to
the
skid
gear
while
it
is
true
they
do
not
control
the
german
company
producing
their
aeroplanes
yet
the
nature
of
their
connection
with
the
enterprise
is
such
that
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
no
radical
changes
in
construction
would
be
made
without
their
approval
and
consent
only
three
dangerous
rivals
official
trials
with
the
model
smashed
many
records
and
leave
the
wright
brothers
with
only
three
dangerous
rivals
in
the
field
and
with
basic
patents
which
cover
the
curve
warp
and
devices
found
on
all
the
other
makes
of
aeroplanes
these
three
rivals
are
the
curtiss
and
voisin
biplane
type
and
the
bleriot
monoplane
pattern
the
bleriot
monoplane
is
probably
the
most
dangerous
rival
as
this
make
of
machine
has
a
record
of
miles
per
hour
has
crossed
the
english
channel
and
has
lifted
two
passengers
besides
the
operator
the
latest
type
of
this
machine
only
weighs
pounds
complete
without
passengers
and
will
lift
a
total
passenger
weight
of
pounds
which
is
a
lift
of
pounds
to
the
square
foot
this
is
a
better
result
than
those
published
by
the
wright
brothers
the
best
noted
being
pounds
per
square
foot
other
aviators
at
work
the
wrights
however
are
not
alone
in
their
efforts
to
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
flying
machine
other
competent
inventive
aviators
notably
curtiss
voisin
bleriot
and
farman
are
close
after
them
the
wrights
as
stated
have
a
marked
advantage
in
the
possession
of
patents
covering
surface
plane
devices
which
have
thus
far
been
found
indispensable
in
flying
machine
construction
numerous
law
suits
growing
out
of
alleged
infringements
of
these
patents
have
been
started
and
others
are
threatened
what
effect
these
actions
will
have
in
deterring
aviators
in
general
from
proceeding
with
their
experiments
remains
to
be
seen
in
the
meantime
the
four
men
named
curtiss
voisin
bleriot
and
farman
are
going
ahead
regardless
of
consequences
and
the
inventive
genius
of
each
is
so
strong
that
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
some
remarkable
developments
in
the
near
future
smallest
of
flying
machines
to
santos
dumont
must
be
given
the
credit
of
producing
the
smallest
practical
flying
machine
yet
constructed
true
he
has
done
nothing
remarkable
with
it
in
the
line
of
speed
but
he
has
demonstrated
the
fact
that
a
large
supporting
surface
is
not
an
essential
feature
this
machine
is
named
la
demoiselle
it
is
a
monoplane
of
the
dihedral
type
with
a
main
plane
on
each
side
of
the
center
these
main
planes
are
of
foot
spread
and
nearly
feet
in
depth
giving
approximately
feet
of
surface
area
the
total
weight
is
pounds
which
is
pounds
less
than
any
other
machine
which
has
been
successfully
used
the
total
depth
from
front
to
rear
is
feet
the
framework
is
of
bamboo
strengthened
and
held
taut
with
wire
guys
have
one
rule
in
mind
in
this
struggle
for
mastery
in
flying
machine
efficiency
all
the
contestants
keep
one
rule
in
mind
and
this
is
the
carrying
capacity
of
an
aeroplane
is
governed
by
the
peripheral
curve
of
its
carrying
surfaces
plus
the
speed
and
the
speed
is
governed
by
the
thrust
of
the
propellers
less
the
resistance
their
ideas
as
to
the
proper
means
of
approaching
the
proposition
may
and
undoubtedly
are
at
variance
but
the
one
rule
in
solving
the
problem
of
obtaining
the
greatest
carrying
capacity
combined
with
the
greatest
speed
obtains

all

some
of
the
new
designs
spurred
on
by
the
success
attained
by
the
more
experienced
and
better
known
aviators
numerous
inventors
of
lesser
fame
are
almost
daily
producing
practical
flying
machines
varying
radically
in
construction
from
those
now
in
general
use
one
of
these
comparatively
new
designs
is
the
van

biplane
made
by
frank
van
anden
of

a
member
of
the
new

one
flight
made
october
is
of
particular
interest
as
showing
the
practicability
of
an
automatic
stabilizing
device
installed
by
the
inventor
the
machine
was
caught
in
a
sudden
severe
gust
of
wind
and
keeled
over
but
almost
immediately
righted
itself
thus
demonstrating
in
a
most
satisfactory
manner
the
value
of
one
new
attachment

and
causes
the

normally
the
wing

are
held
horizontal
by
stiff
springs
introduced
in
the
cables
outside
of
the

it
was
the
successful
working
of
this
device
which
righted
the
van
anden
craft
when
it
was
overturned
in
the
squall
of
october
previous
to
that
occurrence
van
anden
had
looked
upon
the
device
as
purely
experimental
and
had
admitted
that
he
had
grave
uncertainty
as
to
how
it
would
operate
in
time
of
emergency
he
is
now
quoted
as
being
thoroughly
satisfied
with
its
practicability
it
is
this
automatic
device
which
gives
the
van
anden
machine
at
least
one
distinctively
new
feature
while
on
this
subject
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
add
that
curtiss
does
not
look
kindly
on
automatic
control
i
would
rather
trust
to
my
own
action
than
that
of
a
machine
he
says
this
is
undoubtedly
good
logic
so
far
as
curtiss
is
concerned
but
all
aviators
are
not
so
and

transversely
the
curvature
of
the
planes
is
also
laid
out
on
new
lines
that
this
new
plan
is
effective
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
machine
has
been
elevated
to
an
altitude
of
feet
by
using
the
power
of
the
motor
the
system
of
rudder
and
elevation
control
is
very
simple
the
aviator
sits
in
front
of
the
lower
plane
and
extending
his
arms
grasps
two
supports
which
extend
down
diagonally
in
front
on
the
under
side
of
these
supports
just
beneath
his
fingers
are
the
controls
which
operate
the
vertical
rudder
in
the
rear
thus
if
he
wishes
to
turn
to
the
right
he
presses
the
control
under
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
if
to
the
left
that
under
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
the
elevating
rudder
is
operated
by
the
aviator
right
foot
the
control
being
placed
on
a
motor
is
extremely
light
not
the
least
notable
feature
of
the
craft
is
its
motor
although
developing
under
load
or
that
of
an
ordinary
automobile
it
weighs
complete
hardly
pounds
having
occasion
to
move
it
a
little
distance
for
inspection
burgess
picked
it
up
and
walked
off
with
it
cylinders
pistons
crankcase
and
all
even
the
magneto
being
attached
there
are
not
many
engines
which
can
be
so
handled
everything
about
it
is
reduced
to
its
lowest
terms
of
simplicity
and
hence
of
weight
a
single
camshaft
operates
not
only
all
of
the
inlet
and
exhaust
valves
but
the
magneto
and
gear
water
pump
as
well
the
motor
is
placed
directly
behind
the
operator
and
the
propeller
is
directly
mounted
on
the
crankshaft
this
weight
of
less
than
pounds
it
must
be
remembered
is
not
for
the
motor
alone
it
includes
the
entire
power
plant
equipment
the
thrust
of
the
propeller
is
also
extraordinary
being
between
and
pounds
the
force
of
the
wind
displacement
is
strong
enough
to
knock
down
a
boy
as
one
youngster
ascertained
when
he
got
behind
the
propeller
as
it
was
being
tested
he
was
not
only
knocked
down
but
driven
for
some
distance
away
from
the
machine
the
propeller
has
four
blades
which
are
but
little
wider

have
constructed
a
practical
aeroplane
of
ordinary
maximum
size
in
which
is
incorporated
many
new
ideas
the
most
unique
of
these
is
to
be
found
in
the
steering
gear
and
the
provision
made
for
the
accommodation
of
a
pupil
while
taking
lessons
under
an
experienced

immediately
back

is
an
extra

and
an
extra
steering
wheel
which
works
in
tandem

the
front

by
this
arrangement
a
beginner
may
be
easily
and
quickly
taught
to
have
perfect
control
of
the
machine
these
tandem
wheels
are
also
handy
for
passengers
who
may
wish
to
operate
the
car
independently
of
one
another
it
being
understood
of
course
that
there
will
be
no
conflict

applying
for

was
begun
and
is
said
to
be
superior
to
the

the

is
also
new
in
design
this

demand
for

as
a
commercial
proposition
the
manufacture

as
was
the

that
of

this
is
a
startling
statement
but
it
is
fully
warranted
by
the
facts
it
is
barely
more
than
a
year

that
attention
was
seriously
attracted

up
to
that

such
actual

as
were
made
were
almost
exclusively
with
the
sole
purpose
of
demonstrating

full
realization
of

fact
that

possible
for

to
indulge

reach
of
all
who
had
the
inclination
nerve
and
financial
means
to
adopt
it
from
this
event
may
be
dated
the
birth
of
the
modern
flying
machine
into
the
world
of
business
the
automobile
was
taken
up
by
the
general
public
from
the
very
start
because
it
was
a
proposition
comparatively
easy
of
demonstration
there
was
nothing
mysterious
or
uncanny
in
the
fact
that
a
wheeled
vehicle
could
be
propelled
on
solid
substantial
roads
by
means
of
engine
power
and
yet
it
took
comparatively
speaking
a
long
time
to
really
popularize
the
motor
car
wonderful
results
in
a
year
men
of
large
financial
means
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
automobiles
and
expended
fortunes
in
attracting
public
attention
to
them
through
the
medium
of
advertisements
speed
and
road
contests
etc
by
these
means
a
mammoth
business
has
been
built
up
but
bringing
this
business
to
its
present
proportions
required
years
of
patient
industry
and
indomitable
pluck
at
this
writing
less
than
a
year
from
the
day
when
bleriot
crossed
the
channel
the
actual
sales
of
flying
machines
outnumber
the
actual
sales
of
automobiles
in
the
first
year
of
their
commercial
development
this
may
appear
incredible
but
it
is
a
fact
as
statistics
will
show
in
this
connection
we
should
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
up
to
a
year
ago
there
was
no
serious
intention
of
putting
flying
machines
on
the
market
no
preparations
had
been
made
to
produce
them
on
a
commercial
scale
no
money
had
been
expended
in
advertisements
with
a
view
to
selling
them
some
of
the
actual
results
today
flying
machines
are
being
produced
on
a
commercial
basis
and
there
is
a
big
demand
for
them
the
people
making
them
are
overcrowded
with
orders
some
of
the
producers
are
already
making
arrangements
to
enlarge
their
plants
and
advertise
their
product
for
sale
the
same
as
is
being
done
with
automobiles
while
a
number
of
flying
machine
motor
makers
are
already
promoting
the
sale
of
their
wares
in
this
way
here
are
a
few
actual
figures
of
flying
machine
sales
made
by
the
more
prominent
producers
since
july
santos
dumont
machines
bleriot
farman
voisin
antoinette
many
of
these
orders
have
been
filled
by
delivery
of
the
machines
and
in
others
the
construction
work
is
under
way
the
foregoing
are
all
of
foreign
make
in
this
country
curtiss
and
the
wrights
are
engaged
in
similar
work
but
no
actual
figures
of
their
output
are
obtainable
larger
plants
are
necessary
and
this
situation
exists
despite
the
fact
that
none
of
the
producers
are
really
equipped
with
adequate
plants
for
turning
out
their
machines
on
a
modern
basis
the
demand
was
so
sudden
and
unexpected
that
it
found
them
poorly
prepared
to
meet
it
this
however
is
now
being
remedied
by
the
erection
of
special
plants
the
enlargement
of
others
and
the
introduction
of
new
machinery
and
other
conveniences
companies
with
large
capitalization
to
engage
in
the
exclusive
production
of
airships
are
being
organized
in
many
parts
of
the
world
one
notable
instance
of
this
nature
is
worth
quoting
as
illustrative
of
the
manner
in
which
the
production
of
flying
machines
is
being
commercialized
this
is
the
formation
at
frankfort
germany
of
the
flugmaschine

with
a
capital
of
the
krupps
of
essen
being
interested
prices
at
which
machines
sell
this
wonderful
demand
from
the
public
has
come
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
machines
owing
to
lack
of
facilities
for
wholesale
production
are
far
from
being
cheap
such
definite
quotations
as
are
made
are
on
the
following
basis
santos

but
owing
to
the
rush
of
orders
agents
are
readily
getting

there
is
however
no
stability
in
prices
as
purchasers
are
almost
invariably
ready
to
pay
a
considerable
premium
to
facilitate
delivery
the
motor
is
the
most
expensive
part
of
the
flying

motor
prices
range
from
to
this
latter
amount
being
asked
for

systematic
instruction
of
amateurs
in
addition
to
the
production
of
flying
machines
many
of
the
experienced
aviators
are
making
a
business
of
the
instruction
of
amateurs
curtiss
and
the
wrights
in
this
country
have
a
number
of
pupils
as
have
also
the
prominent
foreigners
schools
of
instruction
are
being
opened
in
various
parts
of
the
world
not
alone
as
private
ventures
but
in
connection
with
public
educational
institutions
one
of
these
latter
is
to
be
found
at
the
university
of
barcelona
spain
the
flying
machine
agent
the
man
who
handles
the
machines
on
a
commission
has
also
become
a
known
quantity
and
will
soon
be
as
numerous
as
his
brother
of
the
automobile
the
sign
john
bird
agent
for
skimmer
flying
machine
is
no
longer
a
curiosity
yes
the
airship
is
here
from
all
of
which
we
may
well
infer
that
the
flying
machine
in
practical
form
has
arrived
and
that
it
is
here
to
stay
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
the
time
is
close
at
hand
when
people
will
keep
flying
machines
just
as
they
now
keep
automobiles
and
that
pleasure
jaunts
will
be
fully
as
numerous
and
popular
with
the
important
item
of
practicability
fully
demonstrated
come
take
a
trip
in
my
airship
will
have
more
real
significance
than
now
attaches
to
the
vapid
warblings
of
the
vaudeville
vocalist
as
a
further
evidence
that
the
airship
is
really
here
and
that
its
presence
is
recognized
in
a
business
way
the
action
of
life
and
accident
insurance
companies
is
interesting
some
of
them
are
reconstructing
their
policies
so
as
to
include
a
special
waiver
of
insurance
by
aviators
anything
which
compels
these
great
corporations
to
modify
their
policies
can
not
be
looked
upon
as
a
mere
curiosity
or
toy
it
is
some
consolation
to
know
that
the
movement
in
this
direction
is
not
thus
far
widespread
moreover
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
competition
for
business
will
eventually
induce
the
companies
to
act
more
liberally
toward
aviators
especially
as
the
art
of
aviation
advances
chapter
xix
law
of
the
airship
successful
aviation
has
evoked
some
peculiar
things
in
the
way
of
legal
action
and
interpretation
of
the
law
it
is
well
understood
that
a
man
property
can
not
be
used
without
his
consent
this
is
an
old
established
principle
in
common
law
which
holds
good
today
the
limits
of
a
man
property
lines
however
have
not
been
so
well
understood
by
laymen
according
to
eminent
legal
authorities
such
as
blackstone
littleton
and
coke
the
fathers
of
the
law
the
owner
of
realty
also
holds
title
above
and
below
the
surface
and
this
theory
is
generally
accepted
without
question
by
the
courts
rights
of
property
owners
in
other
words
the
owner
of
realty
also
owns
the
sky
above
it
without
limit
as
to
distance
he
can
dig
as
deep
into
his
land
or
go
as
high
into
the
air
as
he
desires
provided
he
does
not
trespass
upon
or
injure
similar
rights
of
others
the
owner
of
realty
may
resist
by
force
all
other
means
having
failed
any
trespass
upon
or
invasion
of
his
property
other
people
for
instance
may
not
enter
upon
it
or
over
or
under
it
without
his
express
permission
and
consent
there
is
only
one
exception
and
this
is
in
the
case
of
public
utility
corporations
such
as
railways
which
under
the
law
of
eminent
domain
may
condemn
a
right
of
way
across
the
property
of
an
obstinate
owner
who
declines
to
accept
a
fair
price
for
the
privilege
privilege
sharply
confined
the
law
of
eminent
domain
may
be
taken
advantage
of
only
by
corporations
which
are
engaged
in
serving
the
public
it
is
based
upon
the
principle
that
the
advancement
and
improvement
of
a
community
is
of
more
importance
and
carries
with
it
more
rights
than
the
interests
of
the
individual
owner
but
even
in
cases
where
the
right
of
eminent
domain
is
exercised
there
can
be
no
confiscation
of
the
individual
property
exercising
the
right
of
eminent
domain
is
merely
obtaining
by
public
purchase
what
is
held
to
be
essential
to
the
public
good
and
which
can
not
be
secured
by
private
purchase
when
eminent
domain
proceedings
are
resorted
to
the
court
appoints
appraisers
who
determine
upon
the
value
of
the
property
wanted
and
this
value
in
money
is
paid
to
the
owner
how
it
affects
aviation
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
this
privilege
of
the
right
of
eminent
domain
is
accorded
only
to
corporations
which
are
engaged
in
serving
the
public
individuals
can
not
take
advantage
of
it
thus
far
all
aviation
has
been
conducted
by
individuals
there
are
no
flying
machine
or
airship
corporations
regularly
engaged
in
the
transportation
of
passengers
mails
or
freight
this
leads
up
to
the
question
what
would
happen
if
realty
owners
generally
or
in
any
considerable
numbers
should
prohibit
the
navigation
of
the
air
above
their
holdings
it
is
idle
to
say
such
a
possibility
is
ridiculous
it
is
already
an
actuality
in
a
few
individual
instances
one
property
owner
in
new
jersey
a
justice
of
the
peace
maintains
a
large
sign
on
the
roof
of
his
house
warning
aviators
that
they
must
not
trespass
upon
his
domain
that
he
is
acting
well
within
his
rights
in
doing
this
is
conceded
by
legal
authorities
hard
to
catch
offenders
but
suppose
the
alleged
trespass
is
committed
what
is
the
property
owner
going
to
do
about
it
he
must
first
catch
the
trespasser
and
this
would
be
a
pretty
hard
job
he
certainly
could
not
overtake
him
unless
he
kept
a
racing
aeroplane
for
this
special
purpose
it
would
be
equally
difficult
to
identify
the
offender
after
the
offense
had
been
committed
even
if
he
were
located
as
aeroplanes
carry
no
license
numbers
allowing
that
the
offender
should
be
caught
the
only
recourse
of
the
realty
owner
is
an
action
for
damages
he
may
prevent
the
commission
of
the
offense
by
force
if
necessary
but
after
it
is
committed
he
can
only
sue
for
damages
and
in
doing
this
he
would
have
a
lot
of
trouble
points
to
be
proven
one
of
the
first
things
the
plaintiff
would
be
called
upon
to
prove
would
be
the
elevation
of
the
machine
if
it
were
reasonably
close
to
the
ground
there
would
of
course
be
grave
risk
of
damage
to
fences
shrubbery
and
other
property
and
the
court
would
be
justified
in
holding
it
to
be
a
nuisance
that
should
be
suppressed
if
on
the
other
hand
the
machine
was
well
up
in
the
air
but
going
slowly
or
hovering
over
the
plaintiff
property
the
court
might
be
inclined
to
rule
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
a
nuisance
but
right
here
the
court
would
be
in
serious
embarrassment
by
deciding
that
it
was
not
a
nuisance
he
would
virtually
override
the
law
against
invasion
of
a
man
property
without
his
consent
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
invasion
by
the
same
decision
he
would
also
say
in
effect
that
if
one
flying
machine
could
do
this
a
dozen
or
more
would
have
equal
right
to
do
the
same
thing
while
one
machine
hovering
over
a
certain
piece
of
property
may
be
no
actual
nuisance
a
dozen
or
more
in
the
same
position
could
hardly
be
excused
difficult
to
fix
damages
such
a
condition
would
tend
to
greatly
increase
the
risk
of
accident
either
through
collision
or
by
the
carelessness
of
the
aviators
in
dropping
articles
which
might
cause
damages
to
the
people
or
property
below
in
such
a
case
it
would
undoubtedly
be
a
nuisance
and
in
addition
to
a
fine
the
offender
would
also
be
liable
for
the
damages
taking
it
for
granted
that
no
actual
damage
is
done
and
the
owner
merely
sues
on
account
of
the
invasion
of
his
property
how
is
the
amount
of
compensation
to
be
fixed
upon
the
owner
has
lost
nothing
no
part
of
his
possessions
has
been
taken
away
nothing
has
been
injured
or
destroyed
everything
is
left
in
exactly
the
same
condition
as
before
the
invasion
and
yet
if
the
law
is
strictly
interpreted
the
offender
is
liable
right
of
way
for
airships
somebody
has
suggested
the
organization
of
corporations
as
common
carriers
which
would
give
them
the
right
of
eminent
domain
with
power
to
condemn
a
right
of
way
but
what
would
they
condemn
there
is
nothing
tangible
in
the
air
railways
in
condemning
a
right
of
way
specify
tangible
property
realty
within
certain
limits
how
would
an
aviator
designate
any
particular
right
of
way
through
the
air
a
certain
number
of
feet
in
width
and
a
certain
distance
from
the
ground
and
yet
should
the
higher
courts
hold
to
the
letter
of
the
law
and
decide
that
aviators
have
no
right
to
navigate
their
craft
over
private
property
something
will
have
to
be
done
to
get
them
out
of
the
dilemma
as
aviation
is
too
far
advanced
to
be
discarded
fortunately
there
is
little
prospect
of
any
widespread
antagonism
among
property
owners
so
long
as
aviators
refrain
from
making
nuisances
of
themselves
possible
solution
offered
one
possible
solution
is
offered
and
that
is
to
confine
the
path
of
airships
to
the
public
highways
so
that
nobody
property
rights
would
be
invaded
in
addition
as
a
matter
of
promoting
safety
for
both
operators
and
those
who
may
happen
to
be
beneath
the
airships
as
they
pass
over
a
course
adoption
of
the
french
rules
are
suggested
these
are
as
follows
aeroplanes
when
passing
must
keep
to
the
right
and
pass
at
a
distance
of
at
least
feet
they
are
free
from
this
rule
when
flying
at
altitudes
of
more
than
feet
every
machine
when
flying
at
night
or
during
foggy
weather
must
carry
a
green
light
on
the
right
and
a
red
light
on
the
left
and
a
white
headlight
on
the
front
these
are
sensible
rules
but
may
be
improved
upon
by
the
addition
of
a
signal
system
of
some
kind
either
horn
whistle
or
bell
responsibility
of
aviators
jay
carver
bossard
in
recent
numbers
of
brings
out
some
curious
and
interesting
legal
points
in
connection
with
aviation
among
which
are
the
following
private
parties
who
possess
aerial
craft
and
desire
to
operate
the
same
in
aerial
territory
other
than
their
own
must
obtain
from
land
owners
special
permission
to
do
so
such
permission
to
be
granted
only
by
agreement
founded
upon
a
valid
consideration
otherwise
passing
over
another
land
will
in
each
instance
amount
to
a
trespass
leaving
this
highly
technical
side
of
the
question
let
us
turn
to
another
view
the
criminal
and
tort
liability
of
owners
and
operators
to
airship
passengers
if
a
invites
b
to
make
an
ascension
with
him
in
his
machine
and
b
knowing
that
a
is
merely
an
enthusiastic
amateur
and
far
from
being
an
expert
accepts
and
is
through
a
innocent
negligence
injured
he
has
no
grounds
for
recovery
but
if
a
contracts
with
b
to
transport
him
from
one
place
to
another
for
a
consideration
and
b
is
injured
by
the
poor
piloting
of
a
a
would
be
liable
to
b
for
damages
which
would
result
now
in
order
to
safeguard
such
people
as
b
curious
to
the
point
of
recklessness
the
law
will
have
to
require
all
airship
operators
to
have
a
license
and
to
secure
this
license
airship
pilots
will
have
to
meet
certain
requirements
here
again
is
a
question
who
is
going
to
say
whether
an
applicant
is
competent
to
pilot
a
balloon
or
airship
fine
for
an
aeronaut
an
aeroplane
while
maneuvering
is
suddenly
caught
by
a
treacherous
gale
and
swept
to
the
ground
a
crowd
of
people
hasten
over
to
see
if
the
aeronaut
is
injured
and
in
doing
so
trample
over
garden
much
to
the
detriment
of
his
growing
vegetables
and
flowers
who
is
liable
for
the
damages
queer
as
it
may
seem
a
case
very
similar
to
this
was
decided
in
in
the
new
york
supreme
court
and
it
was
held
that
the
aeronaut
was
liable
upon
the
following
grounds
render
one
man
liable
in
trespass
for
the
acts
of
others
it
must
appear
either
that
they
acted
in

ascending
in

balloon
is
not
an
unlawful
act
but
it
is
certain
that
the
aeronaut
has
no
control
over
its
motion

is
at
the
sport

his

is
a
matter
of
hazard
if
his

out

from

all
this

the
general
belief
among
people
is
that
the
air
is
free
not
only
free
to
breathe
and

but
free
to
travel
in
and
that
no

relations
of
owner
and

it
is
a
general
rule
of
law
that
a
master
is
bound
to
provide
reasonably
safe
tools
appliances
and
machines
for
his
servant
how
this
rule
is
going
to
be
applied
in
cases
of
aeroplanes
remains
to
be
seen
the
aeroplane
owner
who
hires
a
professional
aeronaut
that
is
one
who
has
qualified
as
an
expert
owes
him
very
little
legal
duty
to
supply
him
with
a
perfect
aeroplane
the
expert
is
supposed
to
know
as
much
regarding
the
machine
as
the
owner
if
not
more
and
his
acceptance
of
his
position
relieves
the
owner
from
liability
when
the
owner
hires
an
amateur
aeronaut
to
run
the
aeroplane
and
teaches
him
how
to
manipulate
it
even
though
the
prescribed
manner
of
manipulation
will
make
flight
safe
nevertheless
if
the
machine
is
visibly
defective
or
known
to
be
so
any
injury
which
results
to
the
aeronaut
the
owner
is
liable
for
as
to
aeroplane
contracts
at
the
present
time
there
are
many
orders
being
placed
with
aeroplane
manufacturing
companies
there
are
some
unique
questions
to
be
raised
here
under
the
law
of
contract
it
is
an
elementary
principle
of
law
that
no
one
can
be
compelled
to
complete
a
contract
which
in
itself
is
impossible
to
perform
for
instance
a
contract
to
row
a
boat
across
the
atlantic
in
two
weeks
for
a
consideration
could
never
be
enforced
because
it
is
within
judicial
knowledge
that
such
an
undertaking
is
beyond
human
power
again
contracts
formed
for
the
doing
of
acts
contrary
to
nature
are
never
enforcible
and
here
is
where
our
difficulty
comes
in
is
it
possible
to
build
a
machine
or
species
of
craft
which
will
transport
a
person
or
goods
through
the
air
the
courts
know
that
balloons
are
practical
that
is
they
know
that
a
bag
filled
with
gas
has
a
lifting
power
and
can
move
through
the
air
at
an
appreciable
height
therefore
a
contract
to
transport
a
person
in
such
manner
is
a
good
contract
and
the
conditions
being
favorable
could
undoubtedly
be
enforced
but
the
passengers
right
of
action
for
injury
would
be
very
limited
no
redress
for
purchasers
in
the
case
of
giving
warranties
on
aeroplanes
we
have
yet
to
see
just
what
a
court
is
going
to
say
it
is
easy
enough
for
a
manufacturer
to
guarantee
to
build
a
machine
of
certain
dimensions
and
according
to
certain
specifications
but
when
he
inserts
a
clause
in
the
contract
to
the
effect
that
the
machine
will
raise
itself
from
the
surface
of
the
earth
defy
the
laws
of
gravity
and
soar
in
the
heavens
at
the
will
of
the
aviator
he
is
to
say
the
least
contracting
to
perform
a
miracle
until
aeroplanes
have
been
made
and
accepted
as
practical
no
court
will
force
a
manufacturer
to
turn
out
a
machine
guaranteed
to
fly
so
purchasers
can
well
remember
that
if
their
machines
refuse
to
fly
they
have
no
redress
against
the
maker
for
he
can
always
say
industry
is
still
in
its
experimental
stage
in
contracting
for
an
engine
no
builder
will
guarantee
that
the
particular
engine
will
successfully
operate
the
aeroplane
in
fact
he
could
never
be
forced
to
live
up
to
such
an
agreement
should
he
agree
to
a
stipulation
of
that
sort
the
best
any
engine
maker
will
guarantee
is
to
build
an
engine
according
to
specifications

soaring
flight
by
octave
chanute
there
is
a
wonderful
performance
daily
exhibited
in
southern
climes
and
occasionally
seen
in
northerly
latitudes
in
summer
which
has
never
been
thoroughly
explained
it
is
the
soaring
or
sailing
flight
of
certain
varieties
of
large
birds
who
transport
themselves
on
rigid
unflapping
wings
in
any
desired
direction
who
in
winds
of
to
miles
per
hour
circle
rise
advance
return
and
remain
aloft
for
hours
without
a
beat
of
wing
save
for
getting
under
way
or
convenience
in
various
maneuvers
they
appear
to
obtain
from
the
wind
alone
all
the
necessary
energy
even
to
advancing
dead
against
that
wind
this
feat
is
so
much
opposed
to
our
general
ideas
of
physics
that
those
who
have
not
seen
it
sometimes
deny
its
actuality
and
those
who
have
only
occasionally
witnessed
it
subsequently
doubt
the
evidence
of
their
own
eyes
others
who
have
seen
the
exceptional
performances
speculate
on
various
explanations
but
the
majority
give
it
up
as
a
sort
of
negative
gravity
soaring
power
of
birds
the
writer
of
this
paper
published
in
the
aeronautical
annual
for
and
an
article
upon
the
sailing
flight
of
birds
in
which
he
gave
a
list
of
the
authors
who
had
described
such
flight
or
had
advanced
theories
for
its
explanation
and
he
passed
these
in
review
he
also
described
his
own
observations
and
submitted
some
computations
to
account
for
the
observed
facts
these
computations
were
correct
as
far
as
they
went
but
they
were
scanty
it
was
for
instance
shown
convincingly
by
analysis
that
a
gull
weighing
pounds
with
a
total
supporting
surface
of
square
feet
a
maximum
body
of
square
feet
and
a
maximum
of
wing
edges
of
square
feet
patrolling
on
rigid
wings
soaring
on
the
weather
side
of
a
steamer
and
maintaining
an
upward
angle
or
attitude
of
degrees
to
degrees
above
the
horizon
in
a
wind
blowing
miles
an
hour
which
was
deflected
upward
degrees
to
degrees
by
the
side
of
the
steamer
these
all
being
carefully
observed
facts
was
perfectly
sustained
at
its
own
relative
speed
of
miles
per
hour
and
extracted
from
the
upward
trend
of
the
wind
sufficient
energy
to
overcome
all
the
resistances
this
energy
amounting
to
per
second
great
power
of
gulls
it
was
shown
that
the
same
bird
in
flapping
flight
in
calm
air
with
an
attitude
or
incidence
of
degrees
to
degrees
above
the
horizon
and
a
speed
of
miles
an
hour
was
well
sustained
and
expended
per
second
this
being
at
the
rate
of
pounds
sustained
per
horsepower
it
was
stated
also
that
a
gull
in
its
observed
maneuvers
rising
up
from
a
pile
head
on
unflapping
wings
then
plunging
forward
against
the
wind
and
subsequently
rising
higher
than
his
starting
point
must
either
time
his
ascents
and
descents
exactly
with
the
variations
in
wind
velocities
or
must
meet
a
wind
billow
rotating
on
a
horizontal
axis
and
come
to
a
poise
on
its
crest
thus
availing
of
an
ascending
trend
but
the
observations
failed
to
demonstrate
that
the
variations
of
the
wind
gusts
and
the
movements
of
the
bird
were
absolutely
synchronous
and
it
was
conjectured
that
the
peculiar
shape
of
the
soaring
wing
of
certain
birds
as
differentiated
from
the
flapping
wing
might
when
experimented
upon
hereafter
account
for
the
performance
mystery
to
be
explained
these
computations
however
satisfactory
they
were
for
the
speed
of
winds
observed
failed
to
account
for
the
observed
spiral
soaring
of
buzzards
in
very
light
winds
and
the
writer
was
compelled
to
confess
now
this
spiral
soaring
in
steady
breezes
of
to
miles
per
hour
which
are
apparently
horizontal
and
through
which
the
bird
maintains
an
average
speed
of
about
miles
an
hour
is
the
mystery
to
be
explained
it
is
not
accounted
for
quantitatively
by
any
of
the
theories
which
have
been
advanced
and
it
is
the
one
performance
which
has
led
some
observers
to
claim
that
it
was
done
through
i
that
a
bird
acted
upon
by
a
current
actually
drew
forward
into
that
current
against
its
exact
direction
of
motion
buzzards
soar
in
dead
calm
a
still
greater
mystery
was
propounded
by
the
few
observers
who
asserted
that
they
had
seen
buzzards
soaring
in
a
dead
calm
maintaining
their
elevation
and
their
speed
among
these
observers
was
huffaker
at
one
time
assistant
experimenter
for
professor
langley
the
writer
believed
and
said
then
that
he
must
in
some
way
have
been
mistaken
yet
to
satisfy
himself
he
paid
several
visits
to
huffaker
in
eastern
tennessee
and
took
along
his
anemometer
he
saw
quite
a
number
of
buzzards
sailing
at
a
height
of
to
feet
in
breezes
measuring
or
miles
an
hour
at
the
surface
of
the
ground
and
once
he
saw
one
buzzard
soaring
apparently
in
a
dead
calm
the
writer
was
fairly
baffled
the
bird
was
not
simply
gliding
utilizing
gravity
or
acquired
momentum
he
was
actually
circling
horizontally
in
defiance
of
physics
and
mathematics
it
took
two
years
and
a
whole
series
of
further
observations
to
bring
those
two
sciences
into
accord
with
the
facts
results
of
close
observations
curiously
enough
the
key
to
the
performance
of
circling
in
a
light
wind
or
a
dead
calm
was
not
found
through
the
usual
way
of
gathering
human
knowledge
through
observations
and
experiment
these
had
failed
because
i
did
not
know
what
to
look
for
the
mystery
was
in
fact
solved
by
an
eclectic
process
of
conjecture
and
computation
but
once
these
computations
indicated
what
observations
should
be
made
the
results
gave
at
once
the
reasons
for
the
circling
of
the
birds
for
their
then
observed
attitude
and
for
the
necessity
of
an
independent
initial
sustaining
speed
before
soaring
began
both
huffaker
and
myself
verified
the
data
many
times
and
i
made
the
computations
these
observations
disclosed
several
facts
that
winds
blowing
five
to
seventeen
miles
per
hour
frequently
had
rising
trends
of
degrees
to
degrees
and
that
upon
occasions
when
there
seemed
to
be
absolutely
no
wind
there
was
often
nevertheless
a
local
rising
of
the
air
estimated
at
a
rate
of
four
to
eight
miles
or
more
per
hour
this
was
ascertained
by
watching
thistledown
and
rising
fogs
alongside
of
trees
or
hills
of
known
height
everyone
will
readily
realize
that
when
walking
at
the
rate
of
four
to
eight
miles
an
hour
in
a
dead
calm
the
relative
wind
is
quite
inappreciable
to
the
senses
and
that
such
a
rising
air
would
not
be
noticed
that
the
buzzard
sailing
in
an
apparently
dead
horizontal
calm
progressed
at
speeds
of
fifteen
to
eighteen
miles
per
hour
as
measured
by
his
shadow
on
the
ground
it
was
thought
that
the
air
was
then
possibly
rising
feet
per
second
or
six
miles
per
hour
that
when
soaring
in
very
light
winds
the
angle
of
incidence
of
the
buzzards
was
negative
to
the
horizon
that
when
seen
coming
toward
the
eye
the
afternoon
light
shone
on
the
back
instead
of
on
the
breast
as
would
have
been
the
case
had
the
angle
been
inclined
above
the
horizon
that
the
sailing
performance
only
occurred
after
the
bird
had
acquired
an
initial
velocity
of
at
least
fifteen
or
eighteen
miles
per
hour
either
by
industrious
flapping
or
by
descending
from
a
perch
an
interesting
experiment
that
the
whole
resistance
of
a
stuffed
buzzard
at
a
negative
angle
of
degrees
in
a
current
of
air
of
miles
per
hour
was
pounds
this
test
was
kindly
made
for
the
writer
by
professor
zahm
in
the
wind
tunnel
of
the
catholic
university
at
washington
who
moreover
stated
that
the
resistance
of
a
live
bird
might
be
less
as
the
dried
plumage
could
not
be
made
to
lie
smooth
this
particular
buzzard
weighed
in
life
pounds
the
area
of
his
wings
and
body
was
square
feet
the
maximum
of
his
body
was
square
feet
and
that
of
his
wing
edges
when
fully
extended
was
square
feet
with
these
data
it
became
surprisingly
easy
to
compute
the
performance
with
the
coefficients
of
lilienthal
for
various
angles
of
incidence
and
to
demonstrate
how
this
buzzard
could
soar
horizontally
in
a
dead
horizontal
calm
provided
that
it
was
not
a
vertical
calm
and
that
the
air
was
rising
at
the
rate
of
four
or
six
miles
per
hour
the
lowest
observed
and
quite
inappreciable
without
actual
measuring
some
data
on
bird
power
the
most
difficult
case
is
purposely
selected
for
if
we
assume
that
the
bird
has
previously
acquired
an
initial
minimum
speed
of
seventeen
miles
an
hour
feet
per
second
nearly
the
lowest
measured
and
that
the
air
was
rising
vertically
six
miles
an
hour
feet
per
second
then
we
have
as
the
trend
of
the
relative
wind
encountered
or
the
tangent
of
degrees
which
brings
the
case
into
the
category
of
rising
wind
effects
but
the
bird
was
observed
to
have
a
negative
angle
to
the
horizon
of
about
degrees
as
near
as
could
be
guessed
so
that
his
angle
of
incidence
to
the
relative
wind
was
reduced
to
degrees
the
relative
speed
of
his
soaring
was
therefore
velocity
square
root
of
squared
squared
miles
per
hour
at
this
speed
using
the
langley
recently
practically
confirmed
by
the
accurate
experiments
of
eiffel
the
air
pressure
would
be
squared
x
pounds
per
square
foot
if
we
apply
lilienthal
for
an
angle
of
degrees
we
have
for
the
force
in
action
normal
x
x
pounds
tangential
x
x
pounds
which
latter
being
negative
is
a
propelling
force
results
astonish
scientists
thus
we
have
a
bird
weighing
pounds
not
only
thoroughly
supported
but
impelled
forward
by
a
force
of
pounds
at
seventeen
miles
per
hour
while
the
experiments
of
professor
zahm
showed
that
the
resistance
at
miles
per
hour
was
only
pounds
squared
or
x
pounds
at
seventeen
miles
an
squared
hour
these
are
astonishing
results
from
the
data
obtained
and
they
lead
to
the
inquiry
whether
the
energy
of
the
rising
air
is
sufficient
to
make
up
the
losses
which
occur
by
reason
of
the
resistance
and
friction
of
the
bird
body
and
wings
which
being
rounded
do
not
encounter
air
pressures
in
proportion
to
their
maximum
we
have
no
accurate
data
upon
the
to
apply
and
estimates
made
by
myself
proved
to
be
much
smaller
than
the
pounds
resistance
measured
by
professor
zahm
so
that
we
will
figure
with
the
latter
as
modified
as
the
speed
is
seventeen
miles
per
hour
or
feet
per
second
we
have
for
the
work
work
done
x
foot
pounds
per
second
endorsed
by
marvin
corresponding
energy
of
rising
air
is
not
sufficient
at
four
miles
per
hour
this
amounts
to
but
foot
pounds
per
second
but
if
we
assume
that
the
air
was
rising
at
the
rate
of
seven
miles
per
hour
feet
per
second
at
which
the
pressure
with
the
langley
coefficient
would
be
pounds
per
square
foot
we
have
on
square
feet
for
energy
of
rising
air
x
x
foot
pounds
per
second
which
is
seen
to
be
still
a
little
too
small
but
well
within
the
limits
of
error
in
view
of
the
hollow
shape
of
the
bird
wings
which
receive
greater
pressure
than
the
flat
planes
experimented
upon
by
langley
these
computations
were
chiefly
made
in
january
and
were
communicated
to
a
few
friends
who
found
no
fallacy
in
them
but
thought
that
few
aviators
would
understand
them
if
published
they
were
then
submitted
to
professor
marvin
of
the
weather
bureau
who
is
well
known
as
a
skillful
physicist
and
mathematician
he
wrote
that
they
were
theoretically
entirely
sound
and
quantitatively
probably
as
accurate
as
the
present
state
of
the
measurements
of
wind
pressures
permitted
the
writer
determined
however
to
withhold
publication
until
the
feat
of
soaring
flight
had
been
performed
by
man
partly
because
he
believed
that
to
ensure
safety
it
would
be
necessary
that
the
machine
should
be
equipped
with
a
motor
in
order
to
supplement
any
deficiency
in
wind
force
conditions
unfavorable
for

the
feat
would
have
been
attempted
in
by
wright
brothers
if
the
local

had

favorable

were

wright
brothers
were
apprehensive
that
if
they
rose
on
the
ascending
current
of

at
the

and
began
to
circle
like
the
birds
they
might
be
carried
by

past

and

offered
no
greater

in

than
the

as

of

professor
langley
said
in
concluding
his
paper
upon
the
internal
work
of
the

the
final
application
of
these
principles
to
the
art
of
aerodromics
seems
then
to
be
that
while
it
is
not
likely
that
the
perfected
aerodrome
will
ever
be
able
to
dispense
altogether
with
the
ability
to
rely
at
intervals
on
some
internal
source
of
power
it
will
not
be
indispensable
that
this
aerodrome
of
the
future
shall
in
order
to
go
any
distance
even
to
circumnavigate
the
globe
without
alighting
need
to
carry
a
weight
of
fuel
which
would
enable
it
to
perform
this
journey
under
conditions
analogous
to
those
of
a
steamship
but
that
the
fuel
and
weight
need
only
be
such
as
to
enable
it
to
take
care
of
itself
in
exceptional
moments
of
calm
now
that
dynamic
flying
machines
have
been
evolved
and
are
being
brought
under
control
it
seems
to
be
worth
while
to
make
these
computations
and
the
succeeding
explanations
known
so
that
some
bold
man
will
attempt
the
feat
of
soaring
like
a
bird
the
theory
underlying
the
performance
in
a
rising
wind
is
not
new
it
has
been
suggested
by
penaud
and
others
but
it
has
attracted
little
attention
because
the
exact
data
and
the
maneuvers
required
were
not
known
and
the
feat
had
not
yet
been
performed
by
a
man
the
puzzle
has
always
been
to
account
for
the
observed
act
in
very
light
winds
and
it
is
hoped
that
by
the
present
selection
of
the
most
difficult
case
to
explain
the
soaring
in
a
dead
horizontal
calm
somebody
will
attempt
the
exploit
requisites
for
soaring
flights
the
following
are
deemed
to
be
the
requisites
and
maneuvers
to
master
the
secrets
of
soaring
flight
develop
a
dynamic
flying
machine
weighing
about
one
pound
per
square
foot
of
area
with
stable
equilibrium
and
under
perfect
control
capable
of
gliding
by
gravity
at
angles
of
one
in
ten
degrees
in
still
air
select
locations
where
soaring
birds
abound
and
occasions
where
rising

of
gentle
winds
are
frequent
and
to
be
relied
on
obtain
an
initial
velocity
of
at
least
feet
per
second
before
attempting
to
soar
so
locate
the
center
of
gravity
that
the
apparatus
shall
assume
a
negative
angle
fore
and
aft
of
about
degrees
calculations
show
however
that
sufficient
propelling
force
may
still
exist
at
degrees
but
disappears
entirely
at
degrees
circle
like
the
bird
simultaneously
with
the

incline
the
apparatus
to
the
side
toward
which
it
is
desired
to
turn
so
that
the
centrifugal
force
shall
be
balanced
by
the
centripetal
force
the
amount
of
the
required

depends
upon
the

on

as
to
descend
slightly
when

and
to
ascend
when
going
against
the
wind
the
bird
circles
over
one
spot
because
the
rising
trends
of
wind
are
generally
confined
to
small
areas
or
local
chimneys
as
pointed
out
by
sir
maxim
and
others
once
altitude
is
gained
progress
may
be
made
in
any
direction
by
gliding
downward

gravity
the
bird
flying
apparatus
and
skill
are
as
yet
infinitely
superior
to
those
of

but
there
are
indications
that
within
a
few
years
the
latter
may
evolve
more
accurately
proportioned
apparatus
and
obtain
absolute
control
over
it
it
is
hoped
therefore
that
if
there
be
found
no
radical
error
in
the
above
computations
they
will
carry
the
conviction
that
soaring
flight
is
not
inaccessible
to
man
as
it
promises
great
economies
of
motive

in
favorable

of

flying

the
most
ardent
advocates
of
this
form
of
aerial

admit
that
it
has
serious
drawbacks
some
of
these
may
be
described
as

items

the

rapidly
and
a

be

partially
every
time
it
is

the
zeppelin
holds
cubic
feet
of
gas
which
even
at

would
cost

of

a

suddenly
becomes
deflated
by
accident
or
atmospheric

and
similar
causes
one
of
the
largest

the

was
thus
lost
at
stuttgart
in
some
balloon
performances
it
is
only
a
matter
of
fairness
to
state
that
under
favorable
conditions
some
very
creditable
records
have
been
made
with
modern
balloons
viz
november
the
french

and

this
was
a
little
over

expense
of
producing
gas
gas
is
indispensable
in
the
operation
of
dirigible
balloons
and
gas
is
expensive
besides
this
it
is
not
always
possible
to
obtain
it
in
sufficient
quantities
even
in
large
cities
as
the
supply
on
hand
is
generally
needed
for
regular
customers
such
as
can
be
had
is
either
water
or
coal
gas
neither
of
which
is
as
efficient
in
lifting
power
as
hydrogen
hydrogen
is
the
lightest
and
consequently
the
most
buoyant
of
all
known
gases
it
is
secured
commercially
by
treating
zinc
or
iron
with
dilute
sulphuric
or
hydrochloric
acid
the
average
cost
may
be
safely
placed
at
per
feet
so
that
to
inflate
a
balloon
of
the
size
of
the
zeppelin
holding
cubic
feet
would
cost
proportions
of
materials
required
in
making
hydrogen
gas
it
is
customary
to
allow
per
cent
for
loss
between
the
generation
and
the
introduction
of
the
gas
into
the
balloon
thus
while
the
formula
calls
for
iron
times
heavier
than
the
weight
of
the
hydrogen
required
and
acid
times
heavier
the
real
quantities
are
per
cent
greater
hydrogen
weighs
about
ounce
to
the
cubic
foot
consequently
if
we
need
say
cubic
feet
of
gas
we
must
have
pounds
in
weight
to
produce
this
allowing
for
the
percent
loss
we
must
have
times
its
weight
in
iron
or
over
tons
of
acid
it
would
take
times
the
weight
of
the
gas
or
nearly
tons
in
time
of
emergency
these
figures
are
appalling
and
under
ordinary
conditions
would
be
prohibitive
but
there
are
times
when
the
balloon
operator
unable
to
obtain
water
or
coal
gas
must
foot
the
bills
in
military
maneuvers
where
the
field
of
operation
is
fixed
it
is
possible
to
furnish
supplies
of
hydrogen
gas
in
portable
cylinders
but
on
long
trips
where
sudden
leakage
or
other
cause
makes
descent
in
an
unexpected
spot
unavoidable
it
becomes
a
question
of
making
your
own
hydrogen
gas
or
deserting
the
balloon
and
when
this
occurs
the
balloonist
is
up
against
another
serious
proposition
can
he
find
the
necessary
zinc
or
iron
can
he
get
the
acid
balloons
for
commercial
use
despite
all
this
the
balloon
has
its
uses
if
there
is
to
be
such
a
thing
as
aerial
navigation
in
a
commercial
way
the
carrying
of

it
will
come
through
the

even
then
the

must
of
necessity
be
limited
the

long

the

even

chapter
xxii
problems
of
aerial
flight
in
a
lecture
before
the
royal
society
of
arts
reported
in
engineering
lanchester
took
the
position
that
practical
flight
was
not
the
abstract
question
which
some
apparently
considered
it
to
be
but
a
problem
in
locomotive
engineering
the
flying
machine
was
a
locomotive
appliance
designed
not
merely
to
lift
a
weight
but
to
transport
it
elsewhere
a
fact
which
should
be
sufficiently
obvious
nevertheless
one
of
the
leading
scientific
men
of
the
day
advocated
a
type
in
which
this
the
main
function
of
the
flying
machine
was
overlooked
when
the
machine
was
considered
as
a
method
of
transport
the
vertical
screw
type
or
helicopter
became
at
once
ridiculous
it
had
nevertheless
many
advocates
who
had
some
vague
and
notion
of
subsequent
motion
through
the
air
after
the
weight
was
raised
helicopter
type
useless
when
efficiency
of
transport
was
demanded
the
helicopter
type
was
entirely
out
of
court
almost
all
of
its
advocates
neglected
the
effect
of
the
motion
of
the
machine
through
the
air
on
the
efficiency
of
the
vertical
screws
they
either
assumed
that
the
motion
was
so
slow
as
not
to
matter
or
that
a
patch
of
still
air
accompanied
the
machine
in
its
flight
only
one
form
of
this
type
had
any
possibility
of
success
in
this
there
were
two
screws
running
on
inclined
axles
one
on
each
side
of
the
weight
to
be
lifted
the
action
of
such
inclined
screw
was
curious
and
in
a
previous
lecture
he
had
pointed
out
that
it
was
almost
exactly
the
same
as
that
of
a
bird
wing
in
racing
craft
such
inclined
screws
were
of
necessity
often
used
but
it
was
at
a
sacrifice
of
their
efficiency
in
any
case
the
efficiency
of
the
helicopter
could
not
compare
with
that
of
an
aeroplane
and
that
type
might
be
dismissed
from
consideration
so
soon
as
efficiency
became
the
ruling
factor
of
the
design
must
compete
with
locomotive
to
justify
itself
the
aeroplane
must
compete
in
some
regard
or
other
with
other
locomotive
appliances
performing
one
or
more
of
the
purposes
of
locomotion
more
efficiently
than
existing
systems
it
would
be
no
use
unless
able
to
stem
air
currents
so
that
its
velocity
must
be
greater
than
that
of
the
worst
winds
liable
to
be
encountered
to
illustrate
the
limitations
imposed
on
the
motion
of
an
aeroplane
by
wind
velocity
lanchester
gave
the
diagrams
shown
in
figs
to
the
circle
in
each
case
was
he
said
described
with
a
radius
equal
to
the
speed
of
the
aeroplane
in
still
air
from
a
center
placed
from
the
aeroplane
by
an
amount
equal
to
the
velocity
of
the
wind
fig
therefore
represented
the
case
in
which
the
air
was
still
and
in
this
case
the
aeroplane
represented
by
had
perfect
liberty
of
movement
in
any
direction
in
fig
the
velocity
of
the
wind
was
half
that
of
the
aeroplane
and
the
latter
could
still
navigate
in
any
direction
but
its
speed
against
the
wind
was
only
of
its
speed
with
the
wind
in
fig
the
velocity
of
the
wind
was
equal
to
that
of
the
aeroplane
and
then
motion
against
the
wind
was
impossible
but
it
could
move
to
any
point
of
the
circle
but
not
to
any
point
lying
to
the
left
of
the
tangent
finally
when
the
wind
had
a
greater
speed
than
the
aeroplane
as
in
fig
the
machine
could
move
only
in
directions
limited
by
the
tangents
and
matter
of
fuel
consumption
taking
the
case
in
which
the
wind
had
a
speed
equal
to
half
that
of
the
aeroplane
lanchester
said
that
for
a
given
journey
out
and
home
down
wind
and
back
the
aeroplane
would
require
per
cent
more
fuel
than
if
the
trip
were
made
in
still
air
while
if
the
journey
was
made
at
right
angles
to
the
direction
of
the
wind
the
fuel
needed
would
be
per
cent
more
than
in
a
calm
this
per
cent
extra
was
quite
a
heavy
enough
addition
to
the
fuel
and
to
secure
even
this
figure
it
was
necessary
that
the
aeroplane
should
have
a
speed
of
twice
that
of
the
maximum
wind
in
which
it
was
desired
to
operate
the
machine
again
as
stated
in
the
last
lecture
to
insure
the
automatic
stability
of
the
machine
it
was
necessary
that
the
aeroplane
speed
should
be
largely
in
excess
of
that
of
the
gusts
of
wind
liable
to
be
encountered
eccentricities
of
the
wind
there
was
lanchester
said
a
loose
connection
between
the
average
velocity
of
the
wind
and
the
maximum
speed
of
the
gusts
when
the
average
speed
of
the
wind
was
miles
per
hour
that
of
the
gusts
might
be
equal
or
more
at
one
moment
there
might
be
a
calm
or
the
direction
of
the
wind
even
reversed
followed
the
next
moment
by
a
violent
gust
about
the
same
minimum
speed
was
desirable
for
security
against
gusts
as
was
demanded
by
other
considerations
sixty
miles
an
hour
was
the
least
figure
desirable
in
an
aeroplane
and
this
should
be
exceeded
as
much
as
possible
actually
the
wright
machine
had
a
speed
of
miles
per
hour
while
farman
voisin
machine
flew
at
miles
per
hour
both
machines
were
extremely
sensitive
to
high
winds
and
the
speaker
in
spite
of
newspaper
reports
to
the
contrary
had
never
seen
either
flown
in
more
than
a
gentle
breeze
the
damping
out
of
the
oscillations
of
the
flight
path
discussed
in
the
last
lecture
increased
with
the
fourth
power
of
the
natural
velocity
of
flight
and
rapid
damping
formed
the
easiest
and
sometimes
the
only
defense
against
dangerous
oscillations
a
machine
just
stable
at
miles
per
hour
would
have
reasonably
rapid
damping
if
its
speed
were
increased
to
miles
per
hour
thinks
use
is
limited
it
was
the
lecturer
proceeded
inconceivable
that
any
very
extended
use
should
be
made
of
the
aeroplane
unless
the
speed
was
much
greater
than
that
of
the
motor
car
it
might
in
special
cases
be
of
service
apart
from
this
increase
of
speed
as
in
the
exploration
of
countries
destitute
of
roads
but
it
would
have
no
general
utility
with
an
automobile
averaging
to
miles
per
hour
almost
any
part
of
europe
russia
excepted
was
attainable
in
a
day
journey
a
flying
machine
of
but
equal
speed
would
have
no
advantages
but
if
the
speed
could
be
raised
to
or
miles
per
hour
the
whole
continent
of
europe
would
become
a
playground
every
part
being
within
a
daylight
flight
of
berlin
further
some
marine
craft
now
had
speeds
of
miles
per
hour
and
efficiently
to
follow
up
and
report
movements
of
such
vessels
an
aeroplane
should
travel
at
miles
per
hour
at
least
hence
from
all
points
of
view
appeared
the
imperative
desirability
of
very
high
velocities
of
flight
the
difficulties
of
achievement
were
however
great
weight
of
lightest
motors
as
shown
in
the
first
lecture
of
his
course
the
resistance
to
motion
was
nearly
independent
of
the
velocity
so
that
the
total
work
done
in
transporting
a
given
weight
was
nearly
constant
hence
the
question
of
fuel
economy
was
not
a
bar
to
high
velocities
of
flight
though
should
these
become
excessive
the
body
resistance
might
constitute
a
large
proportion
of
the
total
the
horsepower
required
varied
as
the
velocity
so
the
factor
governing
the
maximum
velocity
of
flight
was
the
horsepower
that
could
be
developed
on
a
given
weight
at
present
the
weight
per
horsepower
of
motors
appeared
to
range
from
pounds
up
to
pounds
per
brake
horsepower
some
actual
figures
being
as
follows
antoinette
lbs
fiat
lbs
gnome
under

metallurgic

renault
lbs
wright
lbs
automobile
engines
on
the
other
hand
commonly
weighed
pounds
to
pounds
per
brake
horsepower
for
short
flights
fuel
economy
was
of
less
importance
than
a
saving
in
the
weight
of
the
engine
for
long
flights
however
the
case
was
different
thus
if
the
gasolene
consumption
was
pound
per
horsepower
hour
and
the
engine
weighed
pounds
per
brake
horsepower
the
fuel
needed
for
a
flight
would
weigh
as
much
as
the
engine
but
for
half
an
hour
flight
its
weight
would
be
unimportant
best
means
of
propulsion
the
best
method
of
propulsion
was
by
the
screw
which
acting
in
air
was
subject
to
much
the
same
conditions
as
obtained
in
marine
work
its
efficiency
depended
on
its
diameter
and
pitch
and
on
its
position
whether
in
front
of
or
behind
the
body
propelled
from
this
theory
of
dynamic
support
lanchester
proceeded
the
efficiency
of
each
element
of
a
screw
propeller
could
be
represented
by
curves
such
as
were
given
in
his
first
lecture
before
the
society
and
from
these
curves
the
efficiency
of
any
proposed
propeller
could
be
computed
by
mere
inspection
with
a
fair
degree
of
accuracy
these
curves
showed
that
the
tips
of
propellers
were
inefficient
as
was
also
the
portion
of
the
blade
near
the
root
in
actual
marine
practice
the
blade
from
boss
to
tip
was
commonly
of
such
a
length
that
the
efficiency
was
per
cent
of
that
of
the
most
efficient
element
of
it
advocates
propellers
in
rear
from
these
curves
the
diameter
and
appropriate
pitch
of
a
screw
could
be
calculated
and
the
number
of
revolutions
was
then
fixed
thus
for
a
speed
of
feet
per
second
the
pitch
might
come
out
as
feet
in
which
case
the
revolutions
would
be
per
minute
which
might
however
be
too
low
for
the
motor
it
was
then
necessary
either
to
gear
down
the
propeller
as
was
done
in
the
wright
machine
or
if
it
was
decided
to
drive
it
direct
to
sacrifice
some
of
the
efficiency
of
the
propeller
an
analogous
case
arose
in
the
application
of
the
steam
turbine
to
the
propulsion
of
cargo
boats
a
problem
as
yet
unsolved
the
propeller
should
always
be
aft
so
that
it
could
abstract
energy
from
the
wake
current
and
also
so
that
its
wash
was
clear
of
the
body
propelled
the
best
possible
efficiency
was
about
per
cent
and
it
was
safe
to
rely
upon
per
cent
benefits
of
soaring
flight
there
was
lanchester
proceeded
some
possibility
of
the
aeronaut
reducing
the
power
needed
for
transport
by
his
adopting
the
principle
of
soaring
flight
as
exemplified
by
some
birds
there
were
he
continued
two
different
modes
of
soaring
flight
in
the
one
the
bird
made
use
of
the
upward
current
of
air
often
to
be
found
in
the
neighborhood
of
steep
vertical
cliffs
these
cliffs
deflected
the
air
upward
long
before
it
actually
reached
the
cliff
a
whole
region
below
being
thus
the
seat
of
an
upward
current
darwin
has
noted
that
the
condor
was
only
to
be
found
in
the
neighborhood
of
such
cliffs
along
the
south
coast
also
the
gulls
made
frequent
use
of
the
up
currents
due
to
the
nearly
perpendicular
chalk
cliffs
along
the
shore
in
the
tropics
up
currents
were
also
caused
by
temperature
differences
cumulus
clouds
moreover
were
nearly
always
the
terminations
of
such
up
currents
of
heated
air
which
on
cooling
by
expansion
in
the
upper
regions
deposited
their
moisture
as
fog
these
clouds
might
perhaps
prove
useful
in
the
future
in
showing
the
aeronaut
where
up
currents
were
to
be
found
another
mode
of
soaring
flight
was
that
adopted
by
the
albatross
which
took
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
air
moved
in
pulsations
into
which
the
bird
fitted
itself
being
thus
able
to
extract
energy
from
the
wind
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
the
aeronaut
to
employ
a
similar
method
must
be
left
to
the
future
to
decide
main
difficulties
in
aviation
in
practical
flight
difficulties
arose
in
starting
and
in
alighting
there
was
a
lower
limit
to
the
speed
at
which
the
machine
was
stable
and
it
was
inadvisable
to
leave
the
ground
till
this
limit
was
attained
similarly
in
alighting
it
was
inexpedient
to
reduce
the
speed
below
the
limit
of
stability
this
fact
constituted
a
difficulty
in
the
adoption
of
high
speeds
since
the
length
of
run
needed
increased
in
proportion
to
the
square
of
the
velocity
this
drawback
could
however
be
surmounted
by
forming
starting
and
alighting
grounds
of
ample
size
he
thought
it
quite
likely
in
the
future
that
such
grounds
would
be
considered
as
essential
to
the
flying
machine
as
a
seaport
was
to
an
steamer
or
as
a
road
was
to
the
automobile
requisites
of
flying
machine
flying
machines
were
commonly
divided
into
monoplanes
and
biplanes
according
as
they
had
one
or
two
supporting
surfaces
the
distinction
was
not
however
fundamental
to
get
the
requisite
strength
some
form
of
girder
framework
was
necessary
and
it
was
a
mere
question
of
convenience
whether
the
supporting
surface
was
arranged
along
both
the
top
and
the
bottom
of
this
girder
or
along
the
bottom
only
the
framework
adopted
universally
was
of
wood
braced
by
ties
of
pianoforte
wire
an
arrangement
giving
the
stiffness
desired
with
the
least
possible

some
kind
of
chassis
was
also
necessary

in

circuit
court
granted
a
preliminary
injunction
restraining
the
and
glenn
curtiss
from
manufacturing
selling
or
using
for
exhibition
purposes
the
machine
known
as
the
curtiss
aeroplane
the
injunction
was
obtained
on
the
ground
that
the
curtiss
machine
is
an
infringement
upon
the
wright
patents
in
the
matter
of
wing
warping
and
rudder
control
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
authors
to
discuss
the
subject
pro
or
con
such
discussion
would
have
no
proper
place
in
a
volume
of
this
kind
it
is
enough
to
say
that
curtiss
stoutly
insists
that
his
machine
is
not
an
infringement
of
the
wright
patents
although
judge
hazel
evidently
thinks
differently
what
the
judge
said
in
granting
the
preliminary
injunction
the
judge
said
defendants
claim
generally
that
the
difference
in
construction
of
their
apparatus
causes
the
equilibrium
or
lateral
balance
to
be
maintained
and
its
aerial
movement
secured
upon
an
entirely
different
principle
from
that
of
complainant
the
defendants
aeroplanes
are
curved
firmly
attached
to
the
stanchions
and
hence
are
incapable
of
twisting
or
turning
in
any
direction
that
the
supplementary
planes
or
rudders
are
secured
to
the
forward
stanchion
at
the
extreme
lateral
ends
of
the
planes
and
are
adjusted
midway
between
the
upper
and
lower
planes
with
the
margins
extending
beyond
the
edges
that
in
moving
the
supplementary
planes
equal
and
uniform
angles
of
incidence
are
presented
as
distinguished
from
fluctuating
angles
of
incidence
such
claimed
functional
effects
however
are
strongly
contradicted
by
the
expert
witness
for
complainant
similar
to
plan
of
wrights
upon
this
contention
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
the
affidavits
for
the
complainant
so
clearly
define
the
principle
of
operation
of
the
flying
machines
in
question
that
i
am
reasonably
satisfied
that
there
is
a
variableness
of
the
angle
of
incidence
in
the
machine
of
defendants
which
is
produced
when
a
supplementary
plane
on
one
side
is
tilted
or
raised
and
the
other
stimultaneously
tilted
or
lowered
i
am
also
satisfied
that
the
rear
rudder
is
turned
by
the
operator
to
the
side
having
the
least
angle
of
incidence
and
that
such
turning
is
done
at
the
time
the
supplementary
planes
are
raised
or
depressed
to
prevent
tilting
or
upsetting
the
machine
on
the
papers
presented
i
incline
to
the
view
as
already
indicated
that
the
claims
of
the
patent
in
suit
should
be
broadly
construed
and
when
given
such
construction
the
elements
of
the
wright
machine
are
found
in
defendants
machine
performing
the
same
functional
result
there
are
dissimilarities
in
the
structure
changes
of
form
and
strengthening
of
parts
which
may
be
improvements
but
such
dissimilarities
seem
to
me
to
have
no
bearing
upon
the
means
adopted
to
preserve
the
equilibrium
which
means
are
the
equivalent
of
the
claims
in
suit
and
attain
an
identical
result
variance
from
patent
immaterial
defendants
further
contend
that
the
curved
or
arched
surfaces
of
the
wright
aeroplanes
in
commercial
use
are
departures
from
the
patent
which
describes
flat
surfaces
and
that
such
a
construction
would
be
wholly
impracticable
the
drawing
fig
however
attached
to
the
specification
shows
a
curved
line
inward
of
the
aeroplane
with
straight
lateral
edges
and
considering
such
drawing
with
the
terminology
of
the
specification
the
slight
arching
of
the
surface
is
not
thought
a
material
departure
at
any
rate
the
patent
in
issue
does
not
belong
to
the
class
of
patents
which
requires
narrowing
to
the
details
of
construction
june

referring
to
the
matter
of
priority
the
judge
said
indeed
no
one
interfered
with
the
rights
of
the
patentees
by
constructing
machines
similar
to
theirs
until
in
july
when
curtiss
exhibited
a
flying
machine
which
he
called
the
bug
he
was
immediately
notified
by
the
patentees
that
such
machine
with
its
movable
surfaces
at
the
tips
of
wings
infringed
the
patent
in
suit
and
he
replied
that
he
did
not
intend
to
publicly
exhibit
the
machine
for
profit
but
merely
was
engaged
in
exhibiting
it
for
scientific
purposes
as
a
member
of
the
aerial
experiment
association
to
this
the
patentees
did
not
object
subsequently
however
the
machine
with
supplementary
planes
placed
midway
between
the
upper
and
lower
aeroplanes
was
publicly
exhibited
by
the
defendant
corporation
and
used
by
curtiss
in
aerial
flights
for
prizes
and
emoluments
it
further
appears
that
the
defendants
now
threaten
to
continue
such
use
for
gain
and
profit
and
to
engage
in
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
such
infringing
machines
thereby
becoming
an
active
rival
of
complainant
in
the
business
of
constructing
flying
machines
embodying
the
claims
in

but
such
use
of
the
infringing

it
is
the

of
this

which
has
a
distinct
advantage
in
the
operation
of

as
will
be
hereafter
discussed
does
not
warp
main
surface
defendants
machine
does
not
use
the
warping
of
the
main
supporting
surfaces
in
restoring
the
lateral
equilibrium
but
has
two
comparatively
small
pivoted
balancing
surfaces
or
rudders
when
one
end
of
the
machine
is
tipped
up
or
down
from
the
normal
these
planes
may
be
thrown
in
opposite
directions
by
the
operator
and
so
steer
each
end
of
the
machine
up
or
down
to
its
normal
level
at
which
time
tension
upon
them
is
released
and
they
are
moved
back
by
the
pressure
of
the
wind
to
their
normal
position
rudder
used
only
for
steering
when
defendants
balancing
surfaces
are
moved
they
present
equal
angles
of
incidence
to
the
normal
rush
of
air
and
equal
resistances
at
each
side
of
the
machine
and
there
is
therefore
no
tendency
to
turn
around
a
vertical
axis
as
is
the
case
of
the
machine
of
the
patent
consequently
no
reason
or
necessity
for
turning
the
vertical
rear
rudder
in
defendants
machine
to
counteract
any
such
turning
tendency
at
any
rate
whatever
may
be
the
theories
in
regard
to
this
matter
the
fact
is
that
the
operator
of
defendants
machine
does
not
at
any
time
turn
his
vertical
rudder
to
counteract
any
turning
tendency
clue
to
the
side
balancing
surfaces
but
only
uses
it
to
steer
the
machine
the
same
as
a

has
officially
recognized
the

this
course
was
taken
following
a
conference
held
april
participated
in
by
william

arrangements
were
made
by
which
the

not
give
its
section
to
any
open

where
the

have
not
secured
a

the
substance
of
the
agreement
was
that
the
aero

of
america
recognizes
the
rights
of
the
owners
of
the
wright
patents
under
the
decisions
of
the
federal

and
refuses
to
countenance
the
infringement
of
those
patents
as
long
as
these
decisions
remain
in
force
in
the
meantime
in
order
to
encourage
aviation
both
at
home
and
abroad
and
in
order
to
permit
foreign
aviators
to
take
part
in
aviation
contests
in
this
country
it
was
agreed
that
the
aero

of
america
as
the
american
representative
of
the
international
aeronautic
federation
should
approve
only
such
public
contests
as
may
be
licensed
by
the
wright

and
that
the
wright
company
on
the
other
hand
should
encourage
the
holding
of
open

where
ever
approved
as
aforesaid
by
the
aero

by
granting
licenses
to
promoters
who
make
satisfactory
arrangements
with
the

for
its
compensation
for
the
use
of
its

chapter
xxiv
hints
on
propeller
construction
every
professional
aviator
has
his
own
ideas
as
to
the
design
of
the
propeller
one
of
the
most
important
features
of
construction
while
in
many
instances
the
propeller
at
a
casual
glance
may
appear
to
be
identical
close
inspection
will
develop
the
fact
that
in
nearly
every
case
some
individual
idea
of
the
designer
has
been
incorporated
thus
two
propellers
of
the
variety
while
of
the
same
general
size
as
to
length
and
width
of
blade
will
vary
greatly
as
to
pitch
and
twist
or
curvature
what
the
designers
seek
every
designer
is
seeking
for
the
same
result
the
securing
of
the
greatest
possible
thrust
or
air
displacement
with
the
least
possible
energy
the
angles
of
any
screw
propeller
blade
having
a
uniform
or
true
pitch
change
gradually
for
every
increased
diameter
in
order
to
give
a
reasonably
clear
explanation
it
will
be
well
to
review
in
a
primary
way
some
of
the
definitions
or
terms
used
in
connection
with
and
applied
to
screw
propellers
terms
in
general
use
the
term
pitch
as
applied
to
a
screw
propeller
is
the
theoretical
distance
through
which
it
would
travel
without
slip
in
one
revolution
and
as
applied
to
a
propeller
blade
it
is
the
angle
at
which
the
blades
are
set
so
as
to
enable
them
to
travel
in
a
spiral
path
through
a
fixed
distance
theoretically
without
slip
in
one
revolution
pitch
the
term
pitch
speed
of
a
screw
propeller
is
the
speed
in
feet
multiplied
by
the
number
of
revolutions
it
is
caused
to
make
in
one
minute
of
time
if
a
screw
propeller
is
revolved
times
per
minute
and
if
its
pitch
is
then
the
pitch
speed
of
such
a
propeller
would
be
revolutions
or
per
minute
uniform
a
true
pitch
screw
propeller
is
one
having
its
blades
formed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
enable
all
of
its
useful
portions
from
the
portion
nearest
the
hub
to
its
outer
portion
to
travel
at
a
uniform
pitch
speed
or
in
other
words
the
pitch
is
uniform
when
the
projected
area
of
the
blade
is
parallel
along
its
full
length
and
at
the
same
time
representing
a
true
sector
of
a
circle
all
screw
propellers
having
a
pitch
equal
to
their
diameters
have
the
same
angle
for
their
blades
at
their
largest
diameter
when
pitch
is
not
uniform
a
screw
propeller
not
having
a
uniform
pitch
but
having
the
same
angle
for
all
portions
of
its
blades
or
some
arbitrary
angle
not
a
true
pitch
is
distinguished
from
one
having
a
true
pitch
in
the
variation
of
the
pitch
speeds
that
the
various
portions
of
its
blades
are
forced
to
travel
through
while
traveling
at
its
maximum
pitch
speed
on
this
subject
jamieson
says
in
aeronautics
take
for
example
an
screw
propeller
having
an
pitch
at
its
largest
diameter
if
the
angle
is
the
same
throughout
its
entire
blade
length
then
all
the
porions
of
its
blades
approaching
the
hub
from
its
outer
portion
would
have
a
gradually
decreasing
pitch
the
portion
would
have
a
pitch
the
portion
a
pitch
and
so
on
to
the
portion
which
would
have
an
pitch
when
this
form
of
propeller
is
caused
to
revolve
say
the
portion
would
have
a
calculated
pitch
speed
of
feet
by
revolutions
or
feet
per
min
while
the
portion
would
have
a
calculated
pitch
speed
of
revolutions
by
feet
or
feet
per
minute
effect
of
now
as
all
of
the
portions
of
this
type
of
screw
propeller
must
travel
at
some
pitch
speed
which
must
have
for
its
maximum
a
pitch
speed
in
feet
below
the
calculated
pitch
speed
of
the
largest
diameter
it
follows
that
some
portions
of
its
blades
would
perform
useful
work
while
the
action
of
the
other
portions
would
be
negative
resisting
the
forward
motion
of
the
portions
having
a
greater
pitch
speed
the
portions
having
a
pitch
speed
below
that
at
which
the
screw
is
traveling
cease
to
perform
useful
work
after
their
pitch
speed
has
been
exceeded
by
the
portions
having
a
larger
diameter
and
a
greater
pitch
speed
we
might
compare
the
larger
and
smaller
diameter
portions
of
this
form
of
screw
propeller
to
two
vessels
connected
with
a
line
one
capable
of
traveling
miles
per
hour
the
other
miles
per
hour
it
can
be
readily
understood
that
the
boat
capable
of
traveling
miles
per
hour
would
have
no
useful
effect
to
help
the
one
traveling
miles
per
hour
as
its
action
would
be
such
as
to
impose
a
dead
load
upon
the
latter
progress
the
term
slip
as
applied
to
a
screw
propeller
is
the
distance
between
its
calculated
pitch
speed
and
the
actual
distance
it
travels
through
under
load
depending
upon
the
efficiency
and
proportion
of
its
blades
and
the
amount
of
load
it
has
to
carry
the
action
of
a
screw
propeller
while
performing
useful
work
might
be
compared
to
a
nut
traveling
on
a
threaded
bolt
little
resistance
is
offered
to
its
forward
motion
while
it
spins
freely
without
load
but
give
it
a
load
to
carry
then
it
will
take
more
power
to
keep
up
its
speed
if
too
great
a
load
is
applied
the
thread
will
strip
and
so
it
is
with
a
screw
propeller
gliding
spirally
on
the
air
a
propeller
traveling
without
load
on
to
new
air
might
be
compared
to
the
nut
traveling
freely
on
the
bolt
it
would
consume
but
little
power
and
it
would
travel
at
nearly
its
calculated
pitch
speed
but
give
it
work
to
do
and
then
it
will
take
power
to
drive
it
there
is
a
reaction
caused
from
the
propeller
projecting
air
backward
when
it
slips
which
together
with
the
supporting
effect
of
the
blades
combine
to
produce
useful
work
or
pull
on
the
object
to
be
carried
a
screw
propeller
working
under
load
approaches
more
closely
to
its
maximum
efficiency
as
it
carries
its
load
with
a
minimum
amount
of
slip
or
nearing
its
calculated
pitch
speed
why
blades
are
curved
it
has
been
pointed
out
by
experiment
that
certain
forms
of
curved
surfaces
as
applied
to
aeroplanes
will
lift
more
per
horse
power
per
unit
of
square
foot
while
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
shown
that
a
flat
surface
will
lift
more
per
horse
power
but
requires
more
area
of
surface
to
do
it
as
a
true
pitch
screw
propeller
is
virtually
a
rotating
aeroplane
a
curved
surface
may
be
advantageously
employed
when
the
limit
of
size
prevents
using
large
plane
surfaces
for
the
blades
care
should
be
exercised
in
keeping
the
chord
of
any
curve
to
be
used
for
the
blades
at
the
proper
pitch
angle
and
in
all
cases
propeller
blades
should
be
made
rigid
so
as
to
preserve
the
true
angle
and
not
be
distorted
by
centrifugal
force
or
from
any
other
cause
as
flexibility
will
seriously
affect
their
pitch
speed
and
otherwise
affect
their
efficiency
how
to
determine
angle
to
find
the
angle
for
the
proper
pitch
at
any
point
in
the
diameter
of
a
propeller
determine
the
circumference
by
multiplying
the
diameter
by
which
represent
by
drawing
a
line
to
scale
in
feet
at
the
end
of
this
line
draw
another
line
to
represent
the
desired
pitch
in
feet
then
draw
a
line
from
the
point
representing
the
desired
pitch
in
feet
to
the
beginning
of
the
circumference
line
for
example
if
the
propeller
to
be
laid
out
is
feet
in
diameter
and
is
to
have
a
pitch
the
circumference
will
be
feet
draw
a
diagram
representing
the
circumference
line
and
pitch
in
feet
if
this
diagram
is
wrapped
around
a
cylinder
the
angle
line
will
represent
a
true
thread
feet
in
diameter
and
feet
long
and
the
angle
of
the
thread
will
be
degrees
relation
of
diameter
to
circumference
since
the
areas
of
circles
decrease
as
the
diameter
lessens
it
follows
that
if
a
propeller
is
to
travel
at
a
uniform
pitch
speed
the
volume
of
its
blade
displacement
should
decrease
as
its
diameter
becomes
less
so
as
to
occupy
a
corresponding
relation
to
the
circumferences
of
larger
diameters
and
at
the
same
time
the
projected
area
of
the
blade
must
be
parallel
along
its
full
length
and
should
represent
a
true
sector
of
a
circle
let
us
suppose
a
circle
to
be
divided
into
sectors
one
of
which
represents
a
propeller
blade
if
the
pitch
is
to
be
feet
then
the
greatest
depth
of
the
angle
would
be
part
of
the
pitch
or
inch
if
the
line
representing
the
greatest
depth
of
the
angle
is
kept
the
same
width
as
it
approaches
the
hub
the
pitch
will
be
uniform
if
the
blade
is
set
at
an
angle
so
its
projected
area
is
part
of
the
pitch
and
if
it
is
moved
through
divisions
for
one
revolution
it
would
have
a
travel
of
feet
chapter
xxv
new
motors
and
devices
since
the
first
edition
of
this
book
was
printed
early
in
there
has
been
a
remarkable
advance
in
the
construction
of
aeroplane
motors
which
has
resulted
in
a
wonderful
decrease
in
the
amount
of
surface
area
from
that
formerly
required
marked
gain
in
lightness
and
speed
of
the
motor
has
enabled
aviators
to
get
along
in
some
instances
with
of
the

used
the
first
wright
biplane
propelled
by
a
motor
of
productive
of
a
fair
average

had
a
plane
surface
of
square
feet
now
by
using
a
specially
designed
motor
of
capable
of
developing
a
speed
of
from
to
miles
an
hour
the
wrights
are
enabled
to
successfully
navigate
a
machine

area
of
which
is
about
square
feet
this
apparatus
is
intended
to
carry
only
one
person
the
operator
at
belmont
park
the
wrights
demonstrated
that
the
biplane
is
much
faster
easier
to
manage
in
the
hands
of
a
skilled
manipulator
and
a
better
altitude
climber
than
the
large
and
cumbersome
machines
with
square
feet
of
surface
heretofore
used
by
them
in
this
may
be
found
a
practical
illustration
of
the
principle
that
increased
speed
permits
of
a
reduction
in
plane
area
in
mathematical
ratio
to
the
gain
in
speed
the
faster
any
object
can
be
made
to
move
through
the
air
the
less
will
be
the
supporting
surface
required
to
sustain
a
given
weight
but
there
is
a
limit
beyond
which
the
plane
surface
can
not
be
reduced
with
safety
regard
must
always
be
had
to
the
securing
of
an
ample
sustaining
surface
so
that
in
case
of
motor
stoppage
there
will
be
sufficient
buoyancy
to
enable
the
operator
to
descend

we
will
then
be
able
after

we
are
doing
now
to
send
forth
a

that
will
make
a
new

until
recently
american
aviators
had
not
given
serious
attention
to
any
form
of

aside
from

the
various
foreign
aviators
who
took
part
in
the

unhesitatingly
gave
preference
to
monoplanes
whatever
may
have
been
the
cause
of
this
seeming
prejudice
against
the
monoplane
on
the
part
of
american
air
sailors
it
is
slowly
being
overcome
when
a
man
like
curtiss
who
has
attained
great
success
with
biplanes
gives
serious
attention
to
the
monoplane
form
of
construction
and
goes
so
far
as
to
build
and
successfully
operate
a
single
surface
machine
it
may
be
taken
for

that
the
monoplane
is
a
fixture
in

the
number

there
is
some
feature
of
advantage
in
nearly
all
the
new
makes
interest
centers
chiefly
in
the
antoinette

bleriot
machines
this
is
because
more
has
been
accomplished
with
them
than
with
any
of
the
others
possibly
because
they
have
had
greater
opportunities
for
the
guidance

those
who
may
wish
to
build
a

the
monoplane
type

multiplane
another
innovation
is
a
multiplane
or
machine
built
and
operated
by
b
sellers
formerly
of
grahn
but
now
located
at
norwood
aside
from
the
use
of
four
sustaining
surfaces
the
novelty
in
the
sellers
machine
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
operated
successfully
with
an
motor
which
is
the
smallest
yet
used
in
actual
flight
in
describing
his
work
mr
sellers
says
his
purpose
has
been
to
develop
the
efficiency
of
the
surfaces
to
a
point
where
flight
may
be
obtained
with
the
minimum
of
power
and
judging
by
the
results
accomplished
he
has
succeeded
in
a
letter
written
to
the
authors
of
this
book
mr
sellers
says
i
dislike
having
my
machine
called
a
quadruplane
because
the
number
of
planes
is
immaterial
the
distinctive
feature
being
the
arrangement
of
the
planes
in
steps
a
better
name
would
be
step
aeroplane
or
step
plane
the
machine
as
patented
comprises
two
or
more
planes
arranged
in
step
form
the
highest
being
in
front
the
machine
i
am
now
using
has
four
planes
x
total
about
square
feet
camber
arch
in
the
vertical
keel
is
for
lateral
stability
the
rudder
for
direction
this
is
the
first
machine
so
far
as
i
know
to
have
a
combination
of
wheels
and
runners
or
skids
the
wheels
rise
up
automatically
when
the
machine
leaves
the
ground
so
that
it
may
alight
on
the
runners
a
duthirt
chalmers
opposed
engine
was
used
first
and
several
hundred
short
flights
were
made
the
engine
gave
four
brake
which
was
barely
sufficient
for
continued
flight
the
aeroplane
complete
with
this
engine
weighed
pounds
the
engine
now
used
is
a
bates
opposed
showing
and
apparently
giving
plenty
of
power
the
weight
of
aeroplane
with
this
engine
is
now
pounds
owing
to
poor
grounds
only
short
flights
have
been
made
the
longest
to
date
being
about

in
building

aviation
development
the
wonderful
progress
made
in
the
science
of
aviation
during
the
year

surpasses
any
twelve
months
advancement
recorded
the
advancement
has
not
been
confined
to
any
country
or
continent
since
every
part
of
the
world
is
taking
its
part
in
aviation
history
making
the
rapidly
increasing
interest
in
aviation
has
brought
forth
schools
for
the
instruction
of
flying
in
both
the
old
and
new
world
and
licensed
air
pilots
before
they
receive
their
sanctions
from
the
governing
aero
clubs
of
their
country
are
required
to
pass
an
extremely
trying
examination
in
actual
flights
exhibition
flights
and
races
were
common
in
all
parts
of
the
world
during
and
touring
aviators
visited
india
china
japan
south
africa
australia
and
south
america
giving
exhibitions
and
instruction
europe
was
the
scene
of
a
number
of
races
in
which
entries
ranging
from
ten
to
twenty
aviators
flew
from
city
to
city
around
a
given
circuit
which
in
some
instances
exceeded
miles
in
distance
flights
with
and
without
passengers
became
so
common
that
those
of
less
than
two
hours
duration
attracted
little
attention
there
were
fewer
attempts
at
high
altitude
soaring
although
the
record
in
this
department
of
aviation
was
bettered
several
times
in
place
of
these
high
flights
the
aviators
devoted
more
attention
to
speed
duration
and
spectacular
manoeuvres
which
appeared
to
satisfy
the
spectators
the
prize
money
won
during
exceeded
but
owing
to
the
increased
number
of
aviators
the
individual
winnings
were
not
as
large
as
in
it
is
estimated
that
within
the
past
twelve
months
more
than
miles
have
been
covered
in
aeroplane
flights
and
more
than
seven
thousand
persons
classed
either
as
aviators
or
passengers
taken
up
into
the
air
the
aeroplane
of
today
ranges
through
monoplane
biplane
triplane
and
even
quadraplane
and
more
than
two
hundred
types
of
these
machines
are
in
use
aeroplanes
are
becoming
a
factor
of
international
commerce
the
records
of
the
bureau
of
statistics
show
that
more
than
worth
of
aeroplanes
were
imported
into
and
exported
from
the
united
states
in
the
months
of
july
august
and
september
the
bureau
of
statistics
only
began
the
maintenance
of
a
separate
record
of
this
comparatively
new
article
of
commerce
with
the
opening
of
the
fiscal
year
two
of
the
prominent
developments
of
were
the
introduction
of
the
and
the
motorless
glider
experiments
of
the
wright
brothers
at
killdevil
hills
where
during
the
two
experiments
numerous
flights
with
and
against
the
wind
were
made
culminating
in
the
establishing
of
a
record
by
orville
wright
on
october
when
in
a
per
hour
blow
he
reached
an
elevation
of
feet
and
remained
in
the
air
minutes
and
seconds
the
search
for
the
secret
of
automatic
stability
still
continues
and
though
some
remarkable
progress
has
been
made
the
solution
has
not
yet
been
reached
notable
flights
of
one
of
the
important
features
of
in
aviation
was
the
rapid
increase
in
the
number
and
distance
of
flights
made
either
for
the
purpose
of
exhibition
testing
instruction
or
pleasure
flights
between
cities
in
almost
every
country
of
the
world
became
common
occurrences
so
great
was
the
number
that
only
those
of
more
than
ordinary
importance
because

are
distinct
advantages
there
has
not
yet
been
much
opportunity
to
test
the
airship
in
actual
warfare
the
aeroplane
has
been
used
by
the
italians
in
tripoli
for
scouting
and
reconnoitering
and
is
said
to
have
justified
expectations
on
several
occasions
the
italian
military
aviators
followed
the
movements
of
the
enemy
in
one
instance
as
far
as
forty
miles
inland
at
the
time
of
the
attack
by
the
turks
a
skillful
aeroplane
reconnaissance
revealed
the
approach
of
a
large
turkish
force
believed
to
be
at
the
time
sixty
miles
away
in
the
mountains
aeroplanes
and
airships
as
they
exist
today
would
doubtless
render
very
valuable
service
in
a
time
of
war
both
over
land
and
water
in
scouting
reconnoitering
carrying
dispatches
and
as
some
experts
believe
in
locating
submarines
and
mines
placed
by
the
enemy
in
channels
of
exits
from
ports
a
coast
aeroplane
could
fly
out
or
miles
from
land
and
rising
to
a
great
height
descry
any
hostile
ships
on
the
distant
horizon
observe
their
number
strength
formation
and
direction
and
return
within
two
hours
with
a
report
to
obtain
which
would
require
several
swift
destroyers
and
a
much
greater
time
the
question
as
to
whether
it
would
be
practicable
to
bombard
an
enemy
on
land
or
sea
with
explosive
bombs
dropped
or
discharged
from
flying
machines
or
airships
is
one
which
is
much
discussed
but
hardly
yet
determined
aeroplanes
have
been
constructed
with
floats
in
the
place
of
runners
and
several
attempts
have
been
made
in
some
cases
successfully
to
light
with
them
on
and
to
rise
from
the
water
curtiss
did
this
at
san
francisco
in
january
attempts
have
also
been
made
with
the
aeroplane
to
alight
on
and
to
take
flight
from
the
deck
of
a
warship
toward
the
end
of
aviator
ely
flew
to
land
from
the
cruiser
birmingham
and
in
january
he
flew
from
land
and
alighted
on
the
cruiser
pennsylvania
but
in
these
cases
special
arrangements
were
made
which
would
be
hardly
practicable
in
a
time
of
actual
war
in
november
a
test
was
made
at
newport
by
lieut
rodgers
of
the
navy
of
a
as
an
auxiliary
to
a
battleship
the
idea
of
the
test
was
to
alight
alongside
of
the
ship
hoist
the
machine
aboard
put
out
to
sea
and
launch
the
machine
again
with
the
use
of
a
crane
lieut
rodgers
came
down
smoothly
alongside
the
ohio
his
machine
was
easily
drawn
aboard
with
a
crane
and
the
ohio
steamed
down
to
the
open
sea
where
it
was
blowing
half
a
gale
but
owing
to
the
misjudgment
of
the
ship
headway
one
of
the
wings
of
the
machine
when
it
struck
the
water
after
being
released
from
the
crane
went
under
the
water
and
was
snapped
off
lieut
rodgers
was
convinced
that
this
method
was
too
risky
and
that
some
other
must
be
devised
