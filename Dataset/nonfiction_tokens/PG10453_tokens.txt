preface
the
author
has
aimed
to
prepare
a
on
human
physiology
for
use
in
higher
schools
the
design
of
the
book
is
to
furnish
a
practical
manual
of
the
more
important
facts
and
principles
of
physiology
and
hygiene
which
will
be
adapted
to
the
needs
of
students
in
high
schools
normal
schools
and
academies
teachers
know
and
students
soon
learn
to
recognize
the
fact
that
it
is
impossible
to
obtain
a
clear
understanding
of
the
functions
of
the
various
parts
of
the
body
without
first
mastering
a
few
elementary
facts
about
their
structure
the
course
adopted
therefore
in
this
book
is
to
devote
a
certain
amount
of
space
to
the
anatomy
of
the
several
organs
before
describing
their
functions
a
mere
knowledge
of
the
facts
which
can
be
gained
in
secondary
schools
concerning
the
anatomy
and
physiology
of
the
human
body
is
of
little
real
value
or
interest
in
itself
such
facts
are
important
and
of
practical
worth
to
young
students
only
so
far
as
to
enable
them
to
understand
the
relation
of
these
facts
to
the
great
laws
of
health
and
to
apply
them
to
daily
living
hence
it
has
been
the
earnest
effort
of
the
author
in
this
book
as
in
his
other
physiologies
for
schools
to
lay
special
emphasis
upon
such
points
as
bear
upon
personal
health
physiology
can
not
be
learned
as
it
should
be
by
mere
book
study
the
result
will
be
meagre
in
comparison
with
the
capabilities
of
the
subject
the
study
of
the
text
should
always
be
supplemented
by
a
series
of
practical
experiments
actual
observations
and
actual
experiments
are
as
necessary
to
illuminate
the
text
and
to
illustrate
important
principles
in
physiology
as
they
are
in
botany
chemistry
or
physics
hence
as
supplementary
to
the
text
proper
and
throughout
the
several
chapters
a
series
of
carefully
arranged
and
practical
experiments
has
been
added
for
the
most
part
they
are
simple
and
can
be
performed
with
inexpensive
and
easily
obtained
apparatus
they
are
so
arranged
that
some
may
be
omitted
and
others
added
as
circumstances
may
allow
if
it
becomes
necessary
to
shorten
the
course
in
physiology
the
various
sections
printed
in
smaller
type
may
be
omitted
or
used
for
home
study
the
laws
of
most
of
the
states
now
require
in
our
public
schools
the
study
of
the
effects
of
alcoholic
drinks
tobacco
and
other
narcotics
upon
the
bodily
life
this
book
will
be
found
to
comply
fully
with
all
such
laws
the
author
has
aimed
to
embody
in
simple
and
concise
language
the
latest
and
most
trustworthy
information
which
can
be
obtained
from
the
standard
authorities
on
modern
physiology
in
regard
to
the
several
topics
in
the
preparation
of
this
the
author
has
had
the
editorial
help
of
his
esteemed
friend
sanborn
of
melrose

is
also

introduction
the
study
of
physiology
we
are
now
to
take
up
a
new
study
and
in
a
field
quite
different
from
any
we
have
thus
far
entered
of
all
our
other
studies
physics
history
language
one
comes
home
to
us
with
such
peculiar
interest
as
does
physiology
because
this
is
the
study
of
ourselves
every
thoughtful
young
person
must
have
asked
himself
a
hundred
questions
about
the
problems
of
human
life
how
it
can
be
that
the
few
articles
of
our
daily
bread
meats
and
similar
up
our
complex
bodies
and
by
what
strange
magic
they
are
transformed
into
hair
skin
teeth
bones
muscles
and
blood
how
is
it
that
we
can
lift
these
curtains
of
our
eyes
and
behold
all
the
wonders
of
the
world
around
us
then
drop
the
lids
and
though
at
noonday
are
instantly
in
total
darkness
how
does
the
minute
structure
of
the
ear
report
to
us
with
equal
accuracy
the
thunder
of
the
tempest
and
the
hum
of
the
passing
bee
why
is
breathing
so
essential
to
our
life
and
why
can
not
we
stop
breathing
when
we
try
where
within
us
and
how
burns
the
mysterious
fire
whose
subtle
heat
warms
us
from
the
first
breath
of
infancy
till
the
last
hour
of
life
these
and
scores
of
similar
questions
it
is
the
province
of
this
deeply
interesting
study
of
physiology
to
answer
what
physiology
should
teach
us
the
study
of
physiology
is
not
only
interesting
but
it
is
also
extremely
useful
every
reasonable
person
should
not
only
wish
to
acquire
the
knowledge
how
best
to
protect
and
preserve
his
body
but
should
feel
a
certain
profound
respect
for
an
organism
so
wonderful
and
so
perfect
as
his
physical
frame
for
our
bodies
are
indeed
not
ourselves
but
the
frames
that
contain
us
ships
in
which
we
the
real
selves
are
borne
over
the
sea
of
life
he
must
be
indeed
a
poor
navigator
who
is
not
zealous
to
adorn
and
strengthen
his
ship
that
it
may
escape
the
rocks
of
disease
and
premature
decay
and
that
the
voyage
of
his
life
may
be
long
pleasant
and
successful
but
above
these
thoughts
there
rises
another
in
studying
physiology
we
are
tracing
the
myriad
lines
of
marvelous
ingenuity
and
forethought
as
they
appear
at
every
glimpse
of
the
work
of
the
divine
builder
however
closely
we
study
our
bodily
structure
we
are
at
our
best
but
imperfect
observers
of
the
handiwork
of
him
who
made
us
as
we
are
distinctive
characters
of
living
bodies
even
a
very
meagre
knowledge
of
the
structure
and
action
of
our
bodies
is
enough
to
reveal
the
following
distinctive
characters
our
bodies
are
continually
breathing
that
is
they
take
in
oxygen
from
the
surrounding
air
they
take
in
certain
substances
known
as
food
similar
to
those
composing
the
body
which
are
capable
through
a
process
called
oxidation
or
through
other
chemical
changes
of
setting
free
a
certain
amount
of
energy
again
our
bodies
are
continually
making
heat
and
giving
it
out
to
surrounding
objects
the
production
and
the
loss
of
heat
being
so
adjusted
that
the
whole
body
is
warm
that
is
of
a
temperature
higher
than
that
of
surrounding
objects
our
bodies
also
move
themselves
either
one
part
on
another
or
the
whole
body
from
place
to
place
the
motive
power
is
not
from
the
outside
world
but
the
energy
of
their
movements
exists
in
the
bodies
themselves
influenced
by
changes
in
their
surroundings
finally
our
bodies
are
continually
getting
rid
of
waste
matters
which
may
be
considered
products
of
the
oxidation
of
the
material
used
as
food
or
of
the
substances
which
make
up
the
organism
the
main
problems
of
physiology
briefly
stated
we
shall
learn
in
a
subsequent
chapter
that
the
living
body
is
continually
losing
energy
but
by
means
of
food
is
continually
restoring
its
substance
and
replenishing
its
stock
of
energy
a
great
deal
of
energy
thus
stored
up
is
utilized
as
mechanical
work
the
result
of
physical
movements
we
shall
learn
later
on
that
much
of
the
energy
which
at
last
leaves
the
body
as
heat
exists
for
a
time
within
the
organism
in
other
forms
than
heat
though
eventually
transformed
into
heat
even
a
slight
change
in
the
surroundings
of
the
living
body
may
rapidly
profoundly
and
in
special
ways
affect
not
only
the
amount
but
the
kind
of
energy
set
free
thus
the
mere
touch
of
a
hair
may
lead
to
such
a
discharge
of
energy
that
a
body
previously
at
rest
may
be
suddenly
thrown
into
violent
convulsions
this
is
especially
true
in
the
case
of
tetanus
or
lockjaw
the
main
problem
we
have
to
solve
in
the
succeeding
pages
is
to
ascertain
how
it
is
that
our
bodies
can
renew
their
substance
and
replenish
the
energy
which
they
are
continually
losing
and
can
according
to
the
nature
of
their
surroundings
vary
not
only
the
amount
but
the
kind
of
energy
which
they
set
free
technical
terms
defined
all
living
organisms
are
studied
usually
from
two
points
of
view
first
as
to
their
form
and
structure
second
as
to
the
processes
which
go
on
within
them
the
science
which
treats
of
all
living
organisms
is
called
biology
it
has
naturally
two
divisions
which
treats
of
the
form
and
structure
of
living
beings
and
physiology
which
investigates
their
functions
or
the
special
work
done
in
their
vital
processes
the
word
anatomy
however
is
usually
employed
instead
of
morphology
it
is
derived
from
two
greek
words
and
means
the
science
of
dissection
human
anatomy
then
deals
with
the
form
and
structure
of
the
human
body
and
describes
how
the
different
parts
and
organs
are
arranged
as
revealed
by
observation
by
dissection
and
by
the
microscope
histology
is
that
part
of
anatomy
which
treats
of
the
minute
structure
of
any
part
of
the
body
as
shown
by
the
microscope
human
physiology
describes
the
various
processes
that
go
on
in
the
human
body
in
health
it
treats
of
the
work
done
by
the
various
parts
of
the
body
and
of
the
results
of
the
harmonious
action
of
the
several
organs
broadly
speaking
physiology
is
the
science
which
treats
of
functions
by
the
word
function
is
meant
the
special
work
which
an
organ
has
to
do
an
organ
is
a
part
of
the
body
which
does
a
special
work
thus
the
eye
is
the
organ
of
sight
the
stomach
of
digestion
and
the
lungs
of
breathing
it
is
plain
that
we
can
not
understand
the
physiology
of
our
bodies
without
a
knowledge
of
their
anatomy
an
engineer
could
not
understand
the
working
of
his
engine
unless
well
acquainted
with
all
its
parts
and
the
manner
in
which
they
were
fitted
together
so
if
we
are
to
understand
the
principles
of
elementary
physiology
we
must
master
the
main
anatomical
facts
concerning
the
organs
of
the
body
before
considering
their
special
functions
as
a
branch
of
study
in
our
schools
physiology
aims
to
make
clear
certain
laws
which
are
necessary
to
health
so
that
by
a
proper
knowledge
of
them
and
their
practical
application
we
may
hope
to
spend
happier
and
more
useful
because
healthier
lives
in
brief
the
study
of
hygiene
or
the
science
of
health
in
the
school
curriculum
is
usually
associated
with
that
of
physiology
chemical
elements
in
the
body
all
of
the
various
complex
substances
found
in
nature
can
be
reduced
by
chemical
analysis
to
about
elements
which
can
not
be
further
divided
by
various
combinations
of
these
elements
all
the
substances
known
to
exist
in
the
world
of
nature
are
built
up
when
the
inanimate
body
like
any
other
substance
is
submitted
to
chemical
analysis
it
is
found
that
the
bone
muscle
teeth
blood
may
be
reduced
to
a
few
chemical
elements
in
fact
the
human
body
is
built
up
with
of
the
elements
namely
oxygen
hydrogen
nitrogen
chlorine
fluorine
carbon
phosphorus
sulphur
calcium
potassium
sodium
magnesium
and
iron
besides
these
a
few
of
the
other
elements
as
silicon
have
been
found
but
they
exist
in
extremely
minute
quantities
the
following
table
gives
the
proportion
in
which
these
various
elements
are
present
oxygen
per
cent
carbon
hydrogen
nitrogen
calcium
phosphorus
potassium
sulphur
chlorine
sodium
magnesium
iron
fluorine
as
will
be
seen
from
this
table
oxygen
hydrogen
and
nitrogen
which
are
gases
in
their
uncombined
form
make
up
of
the
weight
of
the
whole
human
body
carbon
which
exists
in
an
impure
state
in
charcoal
forms
more
than
of
the
weight
of
the
body
thus
carbon
and
the
three
gases
named
make
up
about
per
cent
of
the
total
weight
of
the
body
chemical
compounds
in
the
body
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
with
slight
exceptions
none
of
these
elements
exist
in
their
elementary
form
in
the
animal
economy
they
are
combined
in
various
proportions
the
results
differing
widely
from
the
elements
of
which
they
consist
oxygen
and
hydrogen
unite
to
form
water
and
water
forms
more
than
of
the
weight
of
the
whole
body
in
all
the
fluids
of
the
body
water
acts
as
a
solvent
and
by
this
means
alone
the
circulation
of
nutrient
material
is
possible
all
the
various
processes
of
secretion
and
nutrition
depend
on
the
presence
of
water
for
their
activities
inorganic
salts
a
large
number
of
the
elements
of
the
body
unite
one
with
another
by
chemical
affinity
and
form
inorganic
salts
thus
sodium
and
chlorine
unite
and
form
chloride
of
sodium
or
common
salt
this
is
found
in
all
the
tissues
and
fluids
and
is
one
of
the
most
important
inorganic
salts
the
body
contains
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
continued
existence
by
a
combination
of
phosphorus
with
sodium
potassium
calcium
and
magnesium
the
various
phosphates
are
formed
the
phosphates
of
lime
and
soda
are
the
most
abundant
of
the
salts
of
the
body
they
form
more
than
half
the
material
of
the
bones
are
found
in
the
teeth
and
in
other
solids
and
in
the
fluids
of
the
body
the
special
place
of
iron
is
in
the
coloring
matter
of
the
blood
its
various
salts
are
traced
in
the
ash
of
bones
in
muscles
and
in
many
other
tissues
and
fluids
these
compounds
forming
salts
or
mineral
matters
that
exist
in
the
body
are
estimated
to
amount
to
about
per
cent
of
the
entire
weight
organic
compounds
besides
the
inorganic
materials
there
exists
in
the
human
body
a
series
of
compound
substances
formed
of
the
union
of
the
elements
just
described
but
which
require
the
agency
of
living
structures
they
are
built
up
from
the
elements
by
plants
and
are
called
organic
human
beings
and
the
lower
animals
take
the
organized
materials
they
require
and
build
them
up
in
their
own
bodies
into
still
more
highly
organized
forms
the
organic
compounds
found
in
the
body
are
usually
divided
into
three
great
classes
proteids
or
albuminous
substances
carbohydrates
starches
sugars
and
gums
fats
the
extent
to
which
these
three
great
classes
of
organic
materials
of
the
body
exist
in
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
and
are
utilized
for
the
food
of
man
will
be
discussed
in
the
chapter
on
food
chapter
the
proteids
because
they
contain
the
element
nitrogen
and
the
others
do
not
are
frequently
called
nitrogenous
and
the
other
two
are
known
as
substances
the
proteids
the
type
of
which
is
egg
albumen
or
the
white
of
egg
are
found
in
muscle
and
nerve
in
glands
in
blood
and
in
nearly
all
the
fluids
of
the
body
a
human
body
is
estimated
to
yield
on
an
average
about
per
cent
of
albuminous
substances
in
the
succeeding
chapters
we
shall
have
occasion
to
refer
to
various
and
allied
forms
of
proteids
as
they
exist
in
muscle
myosin
coagulated
blood
fibrin
and
bones
gelatin
the
carbohydrates
are
formed
of
carbon
hydrogen
and
oxygen
the
last
two
in
the
proportion
to
form
water
thus
we
have
animal
starch
or
glycogen
stored
up
in
the
liver
sugar
as
grape
sugar
is
also
found
in
the
liver
the
body
of
an
average
man
contains
about
per
cent
of
fats
these
are
formed
of
carbon
hydrogen
and
oxygen
in
which
the
latter
two
are
not
in
the
proportion
to
form
water
the
fat
of
the
body
consists
of
a
mixture
which
is
liquid
at
the
ordinary
temperature
now
it
must
not
for
one
moment
be
supposed
that
the
various
chemical
elements
as
the
proteids
the
salts
the
fats
exist
in
the
body
in
a
condition
to
be
easily
separated
one
from
another
thus
a
piece
of
muscle
contains
all
the
various
organic
compounds
just
mentioned
but
they
are

the
bones
the
skeleton
most
animals
have
some
kind
of
framework
to
support
and
protect
the
soft
and
fleshy
parts
of
their
bodies
this
framework
consists
chiefly
of
a
large
number
of
bones
and
is
called
the
skeleton
it
is
like
the
keel
and
ribs
of
a
vessel
or
the
frame
of
a
house
the
foundation
upon
which
the
bodies
are
securely
built
there
are
in
the
adult
human
body
distinct
bones
of
many
sizes
and
shapes
this
number
does
not
however
include
several
small
bones
found
in
the
tendons
of
muscles
and
in
the
ear
the
teeth
are
not
usually
reckoned
as
separate
bones
being
a
part
of
the
structure
of
the
skin
the
number
of
distinct
bones
varies
at
different
periods
of
life
it
is
greater
in
childhood
than
in
adults
for
many
bones
which
are
then
separate
to
allow
growth
afterwards
become
gradually
united
in
early
adult
life
for
instance
the
skull
contains
naturally
separate
bones
but
in
infancy
the
number
is
much
greater
and
in
old
age
far
less
the
bones
of
the
body
thus
arranged
give
firmness
strength
and
protection
to
the
soft
tissues
and
vital
organs
and
also
form
levers
for
the
muscles
to
act
upon

the

forming
the
framework
of
the

too
early
in
childhood
the
bones
still
contain
a
larger
percentage
of
animal
matter
than
in
more
advanced
life
and
are
therefore
more
liable
to
bend
than
to
break

they
contain
a

bones
of
the

have
little
freedom

bring
the

a
matter
of
the
highest
importance

for
this
reason
the

far
more
than

this
very
significant
opposition
of

characteristic
of

besides

another
essential
to
the
action
of
the
joints
is
the
pressure
of
the
outside
air
this
may
be
sufficient
to
keep
the
articular
surfaces
in
contact
even
after
all
the
muscles
are
removed
thus
the
hip
joint
is
so
completely
surrounded
by
ligaments
as
to
be
and
the
union
is
very
strong
but
if
the
ligaments
be
pierced
and
air
allowed
to
enter
the

the
union
at
once
becomes
much

glairy
fluid

mutton
they
are
so
firmly
held
together
by
tough
ligaments
while
ligaments
are
pliable
and
flexible
permitting
free
movement
they
are
also
wonderfully
strong

may
be
broken

parts
so

some
joints
lack

are
therefore
called
imperfect

joints
allow
little

no
motion
and
have
no
smooth
cartilages
at
their
edges

together
of
the
ends
of
some
of
the
bones
with
their
shafts
does
not
occur
until
somewhat
late
in
life
for
example
the
upper
end
of
the
tibia
and
its
shaft
do
not
unite
until
the
year
the
separate
bones
of
the
sacrum
do
not
fully
knit
into
one
solid
bone
until
the
year
hence
the
risk
of
subjecting
the
bones
of
young
persons
to
undue
violence
from
injudicious
physical
exercise
as
in
rowing
baseball
football
and
the
bones
during
life
are
constantly
going
through
the
process
of
absorption
and
reconstruction
they
are
easily
modified
in
their
growth
thus
the
continued
pressure
of
some
morbid
deposit
as
a
tumor
or
cancer
or
an
enlargement
of
an
artery
may
cause
the
absorption
or
distortion
of
bones
as
readily
as
of
one
of
the
softer
tissues
the
distortion
resulting
from
tight
lacing
is
a
familiar
illustration
of
the
facility
with
which
the
bones
may
be
modified
by
prolonged
pressure
some
savage
races
not
content
with
the
natural
shape
of
the
head
take
special
methods
to
mould
it
by
continued
artificial
pressure
so
that
it
may
conform
in
its
distortion
to
the
fashion
of
their
tribe
or
race
this
custom
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
widespread
with
which
we
are
acquainted
in
some
cases
the
skull
is
flattened
as
seen
in
certain
indian
tribes
on
our
pacific
coast
while
with
other
tribes
on
the
same
coast
it
is
compressed
into
a
sort
of
conical
appearance
in
such
cases
the
brain
is
compelled
of
course
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
change
in
the
shape
of
the
head
and
this
is
done
it
is
said
without
any
serious
result
sprains
and
dislocations
a
twist
or
strain
of
the
ligaments
and
soft
parts
about
a
joint
is
known
as
a
sprain
and
may
result
from
a
great
variety
of
accidents
when
a
person
falls
the
foot
is
frequently
caught
under
him
and
the
twist
comes
upon
the
ligaments
and
tissues
of
the
ankle
the
ligaments
can
not
stretch
and
so
have
to
endure
the
wrench
upon
the
joint
the
result
is
a
sprained
ankle
next
to
the
ankle
a
sprain
of
the
wrist
is
most
common
a
person
tries
by
throwing
out
his
hand
to
save
himself
from
a
fall
and
the
weight
of
the
body
brings
the
strain
upon
the
firmly
fixed
wrist
as
a
result
of
a
sprain
the
ligaments
may
be
wrenched
or
torn
and
even
a
piece
of
an
adjacent
bone
may
be
torn
off
the
soft
parts
about
the
injured
joint
are
bruised
and
the
neighboring
muscles
put
to
a
severe
stretch
a
sprain
may
be
a
slight
affair
needing
only
a
brief
rest
or
it
may
be
severe
and
painful
enough
to
call
for
the
most
skillful
treatment
by
a
surgeon
lack
of
proper
care
in
severe
sprains
often
results
in
permanent
lameness
a
fall
or
a
blow
may
bring
such
a
sudden
wrench
or
twist
upon
the
ligaments
as
to
force
a
bone
out
of
place
this
displacement
is
known
as
a
dislocation
a
child
may
trip
or
fall
during
play
and
put
his
elbow
out
of
joint
a
fall
from
horseback
a
carriage
or
a
bicycle
may
result
in
a
dislocation
of
the
shoulder
joint
in
playing
baseball
a
swift
ball
often
knocks
a
finger
out
of
joint
a
dislocation
must
be
reduced
at
once
any
delay
or
carelessness
may
make
a
serious
and
painful
affair
of
it
as
the
torn
and
bruised
parts
rapidly
swell
and
become
extremely
sensitive
broken
bones
the
bones
especially
those
of
the
upper
limbs
are
often
fractured
or
broken
the
fracture
is
the
most
common
form
the
bone
being
broken
in
a
single
place
with
no
opening
through
the
skin
when
properly
adjusted
the
bone
heals
rapidly
sometimes
bones
are
crushed
into
a
number
of
fragments
this
is
a
fracture
when
besides
the
break
there
is
an
opening
through
the
soft
parts
and
surface
of
the
body
we
have
a
fracture
this
is
a
serious
injury
and
calls
for
the
best
surgical
treatment
a
bone
may
be
bent
or
only
partly
broken
or
split
this
is
called
fracture
from
its
resemblance
to
a
green
stick
this
fracture
is
more
common
in
the
bones
of
children
fractures
may
be
caused
by
direct
violence
as
when
a
bone
is
broken
at
a
certain
point
by
some
powerful
force
as
a
blow
from
a
baseball
bat
or
a
fall
from
a
horse
again
a
bone
may
be
broken
by
indirect
violence
as
when
a
person
being
about
to
fall
throws
out
his
hand
to
save
himself
the
force
of
the
fall
on
the
hand
often
breaks
the
wrist
by
which
is
meant
the
fracture
of
the
lower
end
of
the
radius
often
known
as
the
this
accident
is
common
in
winter
from
a
fall
or
slip
on
the
ice
sometimes
bones
are
broken
at
a
distance
from
the
point
of
injury
as
in
a
fracture
of
the
ribs
by
violent
compression
of
the
chest
or
fracture
may
occur
from
the
vibration
of
a
blow
as
when
a
fall
or
blow
upon
the
top
of
the
head
produces
fracture
of
the
bones
at
the
base
of
the
brain
treatment
for
broken
bones
when
a
bone
is
broken
a
surgeon
is
needed
to
set
it
that
is
to
bring
the
broken
parts
into
their
natural
position
and
retain
them
by
proper
appliances
nature
throws
out
between
and
around
the
broken
ends
of
bones
a
supply
of
repair
material
known
as
plastic
lymph
which
is
changed
to
fibrous
tissue
then
to
cartilage
and
finally
to
bone
this
material
serves
as
a
sort
of
cement
to
hold
the
fractured
parts
together
the
excess
of
this
at
the
point
of
union
can
be
felt
under
the
skin
for
some
time
after
the
bone
is
healed
with
old
people
a
broken
bone
is
often
a
serious
matter
and
may
cripple
them
for
life
or
prove
fatal
a
trifling
fall
for
instance
may
cause
a
broken
hip
popularly
so
called
though
really
a
fracture
of
the
neck
of
the
femur
from
the
shock
of
which
and
the
subsequent
pain
and
exhaustion
an
aged
person
may
die
in
a
few
weeks
in
young
people
however
the
parts
of
a
broken
bone
will
knit
together
in
three
or
four
weeks
after
the
fracture
is
reduced
while
in
adults
six
or
even
more
may
be
required
for
firm
union
after
a
broken
bone
is
strong
enough
to
be
used
it
is
fragile
for
some
time
and
great
care
must
be
taken
especially
with
children
that
the
injured
parts
may
not
be
broken
again
before
perfect
union
takes
place
the
effect
of
alcohol
upon
the
bones
while
the
growth
of
the
bones
occurs
of
course
mainly
during
the
earlier
years
of
life
yet
they
do
not
attain
their
full
maturity
until
about
the
year
and
it
is
stated
that
in
persons
devoted
to
intellectual
pursuits
the
skull
grows
even
after
that
age
it
is
plainly
necessary
that
during
this
period
of
bone
growth
the
nutrition
of
the
body
should
be
of
the
best
that
the
bones
may
be
built
up
from
pure
blood
and
supplied
with
all
the
materials
for
a
large
and
durable
framework
else
the
body
will
be
feeble
and
stunted
and
so
through
life
fall
short
of
its
purpose
if
this
bony
foundation
be
then
laid
wrong
the
defect
can
never
be
remedied
this
condition
is
seen
in
young
persons
who
have
been
underfed
and
overworked
but
the
use
of
alcoholic
liquors
produces
a
similar
effect
hindering
bone
and
preventing
full
development
the
appetite
is
diminished
nutrition
perverted
and
impaired
the
stature
stunted
and
both
bodily
and
mental
powers
are
enfeebled
effect
of
tobacco
upon
the
bones
another
narcotic
the
destructive
influence
of
which
is
wide
and
serious
is
tobacco
its
pernicious
influence
like
that
of
alcohol
is
peculiarly
hurtful
to
the
young
as
the
cell
development
during
the
years
of
growth
is
easily
disturbed
by
noxious
agents
the
bone
growth
is
by
cells
and
a
powerful
narcotic
like
tobacco
retards
and
thus
hinders
the
building
up
of
the
bodily
frame
the
formation
of
healthy
bone
demands
good
nutritious
blood
but
if
instead
of
this
the
material
furnished
for
the
production
of
blood
is
poor
in
quality
or
loaded
with
poisonous
narcotics
the
body
thus
defrauded
of
its
proper
building
material
becomes
undergrown
and
enfeebled
two
unfavorable
facts
accompany
this
serious
drawback
one
is
that
owing
to
the
insidious
nature
of
the
smoky
poison
cigarettes
are
its
worst
form
the
cause
may
often
be
unsuspected
and
so
go
on
unchecked
and
the
other
that
the
progress
of
growth
once
interrupted
the
gap
can
never
be
fully
made
up
nature
does
her
best
to
repair
damages
and
to
restore
defects

the
muscles
motion
in
animals
all
motion
of
our
bodies
is
produced
by
means
of
muscles
not
only
the
limbs
are
moved
by
them
but
even
the
movements
of
the
stomach
and
of
the
heart
are
controlled
by
muscles
every
part
of
the
body
which
is
capable
of
motion
has
its
own
special
set
of
muscles
even
when
the
higher
animals
are
at
rest
it
is
possible
to
observe
some
kind
of
motion
in
them
trees
and
stones
never
move
unless
acted
upon
by
external
force
while
the
infant
and
the
tiniest
insect
can
execute
a
great
variety
of
movements
even
in
the
deepest
sleep
the
beating
of
the
heart
and
the
motion
of
the
chest
never
cease
in
fact
the
power
to
execute
spontaneous
movement
is
the
most
characteristic
property
of
living
animals
kinds
of
muscles
most
of
the
bodily
movements
such
as
affect
the
limbs
and
the
body
as
a
whole
are
performed
by
muscles
under
our
control
these
muscles
make
up
the
red
flesh
or
lean
parts
which
together
with
the
fat
clothe
the
bony
framework
and
give
to
it
general
form
and
proportion
we
call
these
muscular
tissues
voluntary
muscles
because
they
usually
act
under
the
control
of
the
will
the
internal
organs
as
those
of
digestion
secretion
circulation
and
respiration
perform
their
functions
by
means
of
muscular
activity
of
another
kind
that
is
by
that
of
muscles
not
under
our
control
this
work
goes
on
quite
independently
of
the
will
and
during
sleep
we
call
the
instruments
of
this
activity
involuntary
muscles
the
voluntary
muscles
from
peculiarities
revealed
by
the
microscope
are
also
known
as
striped
or
striated
muscles
the
involuntary
from
their
smooth

the

these
muscles
do
not
cover

surround
the
bones
in
continuous
sheets
but
consist
of
separate
bundles
of
flesh
varying
in
size
and
length
many
of
which
are
capable
of
independent
movement
each
muscle
has
its
own

it

that
gives
the

color
to
the

and
nerves
on
their
way

through
the
muscles
but
between
them
each
muscle
is
enveloped
in
its
own
sheath
of
connective
tissue
known
as
the
fascia
muscles
are
not
usually
connected
directly
with
bones
but
by
means
of
white

cords
called

the
intestines
called
vermicular
motion
it
is
the
irregular
and
excessive
contraction
of
the
muscular
walls
of
the
bowels
that
produces
the
pains
of
colic
the
smooth
muscles
are
found
in
the
tissues
of
the
heart
lungs
stomach
and
intestines
in
the
stomach
their
contraction
produces
the
motion
by
which
the
food
is
churned
about
in
the
arteries
and
veins
they
help
supply
the
force
by
which
the
blood
is
driven
along
and
in
the
intestines
that
by
which
the
partly
digested
food
is
mainly
kept
in
motion
thus
all
the
great
vital
functions
are
carried
on
regardless
of
the
will
of
the
individual
or
of
any
outward
circumstances
if
it
required
an
effort
of
the
will
to
control
the
action
of
the
internal
organs
we
could
not
think
of
anything
else
it
would
take
all
our
time
to
attend
to
living
hence
the
care
of
such
delicate
and
important
machinery
has
wisely
been
put
beyond
our
control
thus
too
these
muscles
act
instinctively
without

a

can
use
the

as

as
it
ever
can
but
as

up
long

patient
education
of

is
needed
to
achieve
walking

properties
of
muscular
tissue
the
peculiar
property
of
living
muscular
tissue
is
irritability
or
the
capacity
of
responding
to
a
stimulus
when
a
muscle
is
irritated
it
responds
by
contracting
by
this
act
the
muscle
does
not
diminish
its
bulk
to
any
extent
it
simply
changes
its
form
the
ends
of
the
muscle
are
drawn
nearer
each
other
and
the
middle
is
thicker
muscles
do
not
shorten
themselves
all
at
once
but
the
contraction
passes
quickly
over
them
in
the
form
of
a
wave
they
are
usually
stimulated
by
nervous
action
the
delicate
nerve
fibrils
which
end
in
the
fibers
communicate
with
the
brain
the
center
of
the
will
power
hence
when
the
brain
commands
a
nervous
impulse
sent
along
the
nerve
fibers
becomes
the
exciting
stimulus
which
acts
upon
the
muscles
and
makes
them
shorter
harder
and
more
rigid
muscles
however
will
respond
to
other
than
this
usual
stimulus
thus
an
electrical
current
may
have
a
similar
effect
heat
also
may
produce
muscular
contraction
mechanical
means
such
as
a
sharp
blow
or
pinching
may
irritate
a
muscle
and
cause
it
to
contract
we
must
remember
that
this
property
of
contraction
is
inherent
and
belongs
to
the
muscle
itself
this
power
of
contraction
is
often
independent
of
the
brain
thus
on
pricking
the
heart
of
a
fish
an
hour
after
removal
from
its
body
obvious
contraction
will
occur
in
this
case
it
is
not
the
nerve
force
from
the
brain
that
supplies
the
energy
for
contraction
the
power
of
contraction
is
inherent
in
the
muscle
substance
and
the
stimulus
by
irritating
the
nerve
ganglia
of
the
heart
simply
affords
the
opportunity
for
its
exercise
contraction
is
not
however
the
natural
state
of
a
muscle
in
time
it
is
tired
and
begins
to
relax
even
the
heart
the
muscle
has
short
periods
of
rest
between
its
beats
muscles
are
highly
elastic
as
well
as
contractile
by
this
property
muscle
yields
to
a
stretching
force
and
returns
to
its
original
length
if
the
stretching
has
not
been
excessive
illustration

the
object
of

the
object
of
contraction
is
obvious
like
rubber
bands
if
one
end
of
a
muscle
be
fixed
and
the
other
attached
to
some
object
which
is
free
to
move
the
contraction
of
the
muscle
will
bring
the
movable
body
nearer
to
the
fixed
point
a
weight
fastened
to
the
free
end
of
a
muscle
may
be
lifted
when
the
muscle
contracts
thus
by
their
contraction
muscles
are
able
to
do
their
work
they
even
contract
more
vigorously
when
resistance
is
opposed
to
them
than
when
it
is
not
with
increased
weight
there
is
an
increased
amount
of
work
to
be
done
the
greater
resistance
calls
forth
a
greater
action
of
the
muscle
this
is
true
up
to
a
certain
point
but
when
the
limit
has
been
passed
the
muscle
quickly
fails
to
respond
again
muscles
work
best
with
a
certain
degree
of
rapidity
provided
the
irritations
do
not
follow
each
other
too
rapidly
if
however
the
contractions
are
too
rapid
the
muscles
become
exhausted
and
fatigue
results
when
the
feeling
of
fatigue
passes
away
with

the
muscle
recovers
its

the

generally
by
means
of
a

the

connected
with

is
its

there
are
about
muscles
in
the
human

all
necessary
for
its
various
movements
they
vary
greatly
in
shape
and
size
according

use
some
are
from

long
others
only
a
fraction
of
an
inch
some
are
long
and
others
thin
and
broad
while
still
others
form

thus
some
of
the
muscles
of
the
arm
and
thigh
are
long
and
tapering
while
the
abdominal
muscles
are
thin
and
broad
because
they
help
form
walls
for
cavities
again
the
muscular
fibers
which
surround
and
by
their
contraction
close
certain
orifices
as
those
of
the
eyelids
and
lips
often
radiate
like
the
spokes
of

muscles
are
named
according
to
their

division
of
origin

and
their

thus
we
have
the

so
named

again
we
have
the
and
many
others
with
similar
names
so
called
from
the
points
of
origin
and

we
find
other
groups
named
after
their
special
use
the
muscles
which
bend
the
limbs
are
called
while
those
which
straighten
them
are
known
as
after
a
bone
has
been
moved
by
the
contraction
of
a
muscle
it
is
brought
back
to
its
position
by

contraction
of
another
muscle
on
the
opposite
side
the
former
muscle
meanwhile
being
relaxed
muscles
thus
acting
in
opposition
to
each
other
are
called
antagonistic
thus
the
biceps
serves
as
one
of
the
antagonists
to
the
triceps
and
the
various
flexors

extensors
of
the
limbs
are
antagonistic

the
tendons
the
muscles
which
move
the
bones
by
their
contraction
taper
for
the
most
part
as
before
mentioned
into
tendons
these
are
commonly
very
strong
cords
like
belts
or
straps
made
up
of
white
fibrous
tissue
tendons
are
most
numerous
about
the
larger
joints
where
they
permit
free
action
and
yet
occupy
but
little
space
large
and
prominent
muscles
in
these
places
would
be
clumsy
and
inconvenient
if
we
bend
the
arm
or
leg
forcibly
and
grasp
the
inside
of
the
elbow
or
knee
joint
we
can
feel
the
tendons
beneath
the
skin
the
numerous
tendons
in
the
palm
or
on
the
back
of
the
hand
contribute
to
its
marvelous
dexterity
and
flexibility
the
thickest
and
strongest
tendon
in
the
body
is
the
tendon
of
achilles
which
connects
the
great
muscles
in
the
calf
of
the
leg
with
the
heel
bone
sec
when
muscles
contract
forcibly
they
pull
upon
the
tendons
which
transmit
the
movement
to
the
bones
to
which
they
are
attached
tendons
may
be
compared
to
ropes
or
cords
which
when
pulled
are
made
to
act
upon
distant
objects
to
which
one
end

sometimes
the

runs
down

of
a
muscle

run
obliquely

resembling
the
quill
in

feather
again
tendons
are
spread
out
in
a
flat
layer
on
the
surface
of
muscles
in
which
case
they
are
called
aponeuroses
sometimes
a
tendon
is
found
in

this
is

the

movements
as

are
the
muscles
which
by

cause

bones
to
move

all
these
movements
both
of

and
of

occur
according
to
certain
fixed
laws
of
mechanics
the
bones
to
which
a
great
proportion
of
the
muscles
in
the
body
are
attached
act
as
distinct
levers
the
muscles
supply
the

fulcrums
or

the

the

levers
in

in

three
classes
of
levers
are
described
according
to
the
relative
position
of
the
power
the
fulcrum
and
the
resistance
all
the
movements
of
the
bones
can
be
referred
to
one
or
another
of
these
three
classes
levers
of
the
first
class
are
those
in
which
the
fulcrum
is
between
the
power
and
the
weight

lift
a
weight
at
one
end
by

application
of
power
at
the
other

fulcrum
is
a
familiar
example
of
this
class
there
are
several
examples
of
this
in
the
human
body
the
head
supported
on
the
atlas
is
one
the
joint
between
the
atlas
and
the
skull
is
the
fulcrum
the
weight
of
the
head
is
the
resistance
the
power
is
behind
where
the
muscles
from
the
neck
are
attached
to
the
back
of
the
skull
the
object
of
this
arrangement
is
to
keep
the
head
steady
and
balanced
on
the
spinal
column
and
to
move
it
backward
and

a
familiar
example
is
the
crowbar
when
used
for
lifting
a
weight
while
one
end
rests
on
the
ground
this
class
of
levers
is
not
common
in
the
body
standing
on
tiptoe
is
however
an
example
here
the
toes
in
contact
with
the
ground
are
the
fulcrum
the
power
is
the
action
of
the
muscles
of
the
calf
and
between
these
is
the
weight
of
the
body
transmitted
down
the
bones
of

leg
to

foot
levers
of
the
third
class
are
those
in
which
the
power
is
applied
at
a
point
between
the
fulcrum
and
weight
a
familiar
example
is
where
a
workman
raises
a
ladder
against
a
wall
this
class
of
levers
is
common
in
the
body
in
bending
the
forearm
on
the
arm
familiarly
known
as
your
muscle
the
power
is
supplied
by
the
biceps
muscle
attached
to
the
radius
the
fulcrum
is
the
elbow
joint
at
one
end
of
the
lever
and
the

is
the

of

forearm
at

these
experiments
showing
how
the
bones
serve
as
levers
may
be
multiplied
and

circumstances
may
require

position
the
erect
position
is
peculiar
to
man
no
other
animal
naturally
assumes
it
or
is
able
to
keep
it
long
it
is
the
result
of
a
somewhat
complex
arrangement
of
muscles
which
balance
each
other
some
pulling
backwards
and
some
forwards
although
the
whole
skeleton
is
formed
with
reference
to
the
erect
position
yet
this
attitude
is
slowly
learned
in
infancy
in
the
erect
position
the
center
of
gravity
lies
in
the
joint
between
the
sacrum
and
the
last
lumbar
vertebra
a
line
dropped
from
this
point
would
fall
between
the
feet
just
in
front
of
the
ankle
joints
we
rarely
stand
with
the
feet
close
together
because
that
basis
of
support
is
too
small
for
a
firm
position
hence
in
all
efforts
requiring
vigorous
muscular
movements
the
feet
are
kept
more
or
less
apart
to
enlarge
the
basis
of
support
now
on
account
of
the
large
number
and
flexibility
of
the
joints
the
body
could
not
be
kept
in
an
upright
position
without
the
cooperation
of
certain
groups
of
muscles
the
muscles
of
the
calf
of
the
leg
acting
on
the
thigh
bone
above
the
knee
keep
the
body
from
falling
forward
while
another
set
in
front
of
the
thigh
helps
hold
the
leg
straight
these
thigh
muscles
also
tend
to
pull
the
trunk
forward
but
in
turn
are
balanced
by
the
powerful
muscles
of
the
lower
back
which
help
keep
the
body
straight
and
braced
the
head
is
kept
balanced
on
the
neck
partly
by
the
central
position
of
the
joint
between
the
atlas
and
axis
and
partly
by
means
of
strong
muscles
thus
the
combined
action
of
these
and
other
muscles
serves
to
balance
the
body
and
keep
it
erect
a
blow
on
the
head
or
a
sudden
shock
to
the
nervous
system
causes
the
body
to
fall
in

the

upon
the

it
is
found
that
a
man
can
do
more
work
without
alcohol
than
with
it
after
taking
it
there
may
be
a
momentary
increase
of
activity
but
this
lasts
only
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
at
the
most
it
is
followed
by
a
rapid
reduction
of
power
that
more
than
outweighs
the
momentary
gain
while
the
quality
of
the
work
is
decidedly
impaired
from
the
time
the
alcohol
is
taken
even
in
the
case
of
hard
work
that
must
be
speedily
done
alcohol
does
not
help
but
hinders
its
execution
the
tired
man
who
does
not
understand
the
effects
of
alcohol
often
supposes
that
it
increases
his
strength
when
in
fact
it
only
deadens
his
sense
of
fatigue
by
paralyzing
his
nerves
when
put
to
the
test
he
is
surprised
at
his
full
intoxication
produces
by
its
peculiar
depression
of
the
brain
and
nervous
system
an
artificial
and
temporary
paralysis
of
the
muscles
as
is
obvious
in
the
pitifully
helpless
condition
of
a
man
fully
intoxicated
but
even
partial
approach
to
intoxication
involves
its
proportionate
impairment
of
nervous
integrity
and
therefore
just
so
much
diminution
of
muscular
force
all
athletes
recognize
this
fact
as
while
training
for
a
contest
rigid
abstinence
is
the
rule
both
from

this
muscular
weakness
is

also
that
the

escaping

of

is
from
thirty

fifty
per

less
than

this
carbon
stifles
the
nervous
energy
and
cuts
off
the
power
that
controls
muscular
force
this
lost

is
in
close
ratio
to
the
retained
carbon
so
much
perverted
chemical
change
so
much
loss
of
muscular
power
not
only
the

but
the
fine

of

is
lost
the

of

of

and
fingers
as
in
neat
penmanship
or
the
use
of

to
this
perverted

is
also
due
the
fatty
degeneration
so
common
in
inebriates
affecting
the

the
heart

the

these
organs
are
encroached
upon
by
globules
of

a
hydrocarbon

while
very

become
a
source
of

even
of

they
abnormally
invade
vital

other
poisons
as
phosphorus
produce
this
fatty
decay
more
rapidly

alcohol
causes
it
in
a
much
more
general
way

is
proved
by

children
pent

this
natural

although

the
full

of
the
bodily

unlike
other
machines
the
human
body
becomes
within

limits
stronger

the
more

at

it
is
our

it
is
therefore
of
paramount
importance
to
rightly
exercise
every

and
this
without
undue
effort
or
injurious
strain
strictly
speaking
physical
exercise
refers
to
the
functional
activity
of
each

every
tissue
and
properly
includes
the
regulation
of
the

and
movements
of
the
entire
body
the
word
exercise
however
is
used
usually
in
a
narrower
sense
as
applied
to
those
movements
that
are
effected
by
the
contraction
of
the
voluntary
muscles
brief
reference
will
be
made
in
this
chapter
only
to
such
natural
and
systematic
physical
training
as
should
enter
into
the
life
of
every
healthy
person
muscular
activity
the
body
as
we
have
learned
is
built
up
of
certain
elementary
tissues
which
are
combined
to
make
bones
muscles
nerves
and
other
structures
the
tissues
in
turn
are
made
up
of
countless
minute
cells
each
of
which
has
its
birth
lives
its
brief
moment
to
do
its
work
in
the
animal
economy
is
separated
from
the
tissue
of
which
it
was
a
part
and
is
in
due
time
eliminated
by
the
organs
of
excretion
lungs
the
skin
or
the
kidneys
thus
there
is
a
continuous
process
of
growth
of
decay
and
removal
among
the
individual
cells
of
each
tissue
note
the
incessant
changes
in
muscular
tissue
every
tiny
block
of
muscle
there
is
a
part
which
is
really
alive
there
are
parts
which
are
becoming
alive
there
are
parts
which
have
been
alive
and
are
now
dying
or
dead
there
is
an
upward
rush
from
the
lifeless
to
the
living
a
downward
rush
from
the
living
to
the
dead
this
is
always
going
on
whether
the
muscle
be
quiet
and
at
rest
or
whether
it
be
active
and
moving
of
the
capital
of
living
material
is
being
spent
changed
into
dead
waste
some
of
the
new
food
is
always
being
raised
into
living
capital
but
when
the
muscle
is
called
upon
to
do
work
when
it
is
put
into
movement
the
expenditure
is
quickened
there
is
a
run
upon
the
living
capital
the
greater
the
more
urgent
the
call
for
michael
foster
these
ceaseless
processes
are
greatly
modified
by
the
activity
of
the
bodily
functions
every
movement
of
a
muscle
for
instance
involves
change
in
its
component
cells
and
since
the
loss
of
every
atom
of
the
body
is
in
direct
relation
to
its
activity
a
second
process
is
necessary
to
repair
this
constant
waste
else
the
body
would
rapidly
diminish
in
size
and
strength
and
life
itself
would
soon
end
this
process
of
repair
is
accomplished
as
we
shall
learn
in
chapters
vi
and
by
the
organs
of
nutrition
which
convert
the
food
into

systematic
exercise
influences
the
growth
and
structure
of
the
muscles
of
the
body
in
a
manner
somewhat
remarkable
muscular
exercise
makes
muscular
tissue
from
the
lack

it
muscles
become
soft
and
wasted
muscles
properly
exercised
not
only
increase
in
size
both
as

whole
and
in
their
individual
structure
but
are
better
enabled
to
get
rid
of
material
which
tends
to
hamper
their
movements
thus
muscular
exercise
helps
to
remove
any
needless
accumulation
of

as
well
as
useless

which
may
exist
in

strength
provides
the
joints
with
more
powerful
ligaments
and

after

from

the
joints
have
wasted

and
the

duly
exercised

influence
the
size
of
the

upon

they
act
thus

of
a

a
great

work
and
one
important
cause
of
fatigue
is
removed
effect
of
exercise
on
important
organs
the
importance
of
regular
exercise
is
best
understood
by
noting
its
effects
upon
the
principal
organs
of
the
body
as
the
action
of
the
heart
is
increased
both
in
force
and
frequency
during
exercise
the
flow
of
blood
throughout
the
body
is
augmented
this
results
from
the
force
of
the
muscular
contractions
which
play
their
part
in
pressing
the
blood
in
the
veins
onward
towards
the
heart
exercise
also
induces
a
more
vigorous
respiration
and
under
increased
breathing
efforts
the
lung
capacity
is
increased
and
the
size
of
the
chest
is
enlarged
the
amount
of
air
inspired
and
expired
in
a
given
time
is
much
larger
than
if
the
body
were
at
rest
the
blood
is
thus
supplied
with
a
much
larger
amount
of
oxygen
from
the
air
inhaled
and
gives
off
to
the
air
a
corresponding
excess
of
carbon
dioxid
and
water
again
exercise
stimulates
and
strengthens
the
organs
of
digestion
the
appetite
is
improved
as
is
especially
noted
after
exercise
in
the
open
air
the
digestion
is
more
complete
absorption
becomes
more
rapid
the
peristaltic
movements
of
the
bowels
are
promoted
and
the
circulation
through
the
liver
is
more
vigorous
more
food
is
taken
to
supply
the
force
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
the
mechanical
movements
ample
exercise
also
checks
the
tendency
towards
a
torpid
circulation
in
the
larger
digestive
organs
as
the
stomach
and
the
liver
so
common
with
those
who
eat
heartily
but
lead
sedentary
lives
in
short
exercise
may
be
regarded
as
a
great
regulator
of
nutrition
exercise
increases
the
flow
of
blood
through
the
small
vessels
of
the
skin
and
thus
increases
the
radiation
of
heat
from
the
surface
if
the
exercise
be
vigorous
and
the
weather
hot
a
profuse
sweat
ensues
the
rapid
evaporation
of
which
cools
the
body
the
skin
is
thus
a
most
important
regulator
of
the
bodily
temperature
and
prevents
any
rise
above
the
normal
which
would
otherwise
result
from
vigorous
exercise

and
an
easier

more
graceful
carriage
rounded

the
awkward
gait
disappears
and
there
is
seen
a
graceful
poise
to
the
head
and
a
bearing
of
the
body
which
mark
those
whose
muscles
have
been
well
trained
a
perfectly
formed
skeleton
and
muscles
give
the
graceful
contour
and
perfect
outline
to
the
human

the
lean
soft
limbs
of
those
who
have
never
had
any
physical
education
often
look
as
if
they
belonged
to
persons
recovering
from
sickness
the
effects
of
sound
physical
exercise
are
well
exhibited
in
the
aspect
of
the
neck
shoulders
and
chest
of
one
who
has
been
well
trained
this
is
noticeable
in
gymnasts
and
others
who
practice
upon
the
horizontal
bar
with
chest
weights
and
other
apparatus
which
develop
more
especially
the
muscles
of
the
upper
half
of

improves

condition
of
the
tissues
generally
they
become
more
elastic
and
in
all
respects
sounder
the
skin
becomes
firm
clear
and
wholesome
hence
every
part
of
the
surface
of
the
body
rapidly
takes
on
a
change
in
contour
and
soon
assumes
that
appearance
of
vigor
and
soundness
which
marks
those
of
firm
physical
condition
the
delicate
ruddy
aspect
of
the
complexion
the
swing
about
the
body
and
the
bearing
of
the
head
and
shoulders
of
young
women
whose
physical
training
has
been
efficient
are
in
marked
contrast
with
those
characteristics
in
persons
whose
education
in
this
respect
has
been
neglected
effect
of
unsuitable
or
excessive
exercise
but
exercise
like
everything
else
which
contributes
to
our
welfare
may
be
carried
to
excess
the
words
excessive
and
unsuitable
when
applied
to
muscular
exertion
are
relative
terms
and
apply
to
the
individual
rather
than
to
amount
of
work
done
thus
what
may
be
excessive
for
one
person
might
be
suitable
and
beneficial
to
another
then
the
condition
of
the
individual
rather
than
the
character
of
the
muscular
work
is
always
a
most
important
factor
breathlessness
is
perhaps
the
most
common
effect
of
undue
exertion
let
a
person
who
is
out
of
practice
run
a
certain
distance
and
he
is
soon
troubled
with
his
breathing
the
respirations
become
irregular
and
there
is
a
sense
of
oppression
in
his
chest
he
pants
and
his
strength
gives
out
his
chest
and
not
his
legs
has
failed
him
he
is
said
to
be
of
he
might
have
practiced
or
rowed
for
some
time
without
inconvenience
the
heart
is
often
overstrained
and
at
times
has
been
ruptured
during
violent
exertion
as
in
lifting
an
immense
weight
the
various
forms
of
are
common
with
those
whose
occupations
involve
severe
muscular
effort
as
professional
athletes
and
oarsmen
hæmorrhages
of
various
kinds
especially
from
the
lungs
or
rupture
of
in
the
brain
are
not
uncommon
results
of
excessive
repetition
of
muscular
movements
may
lead
to
permanent
contractions
of
the
parts
involved
thus
sailors
mechanics
and
others
frequently
develop
a
rigidity
of
the
tendons
of
the
hand
which
prevents
the
full
extension
of
the
fingers
so
stenographers
telegraphers
and
writers
occasionally
suffer
from
permanent
contractions
of
certain
muscles
of
the
arm
known
as
cramp
due
to
their
excessive
use
but
the
accidents
which
now
and
then
may
result
from
severe
physical
exertion
should
discourage
no
one
from
securing
the
benefits
which
accrue
from
moderate
and
reasonable
exercise
muscular
fatigue
we
all
know
how
tiresome
it
is
to
hold
the
arm
outstretched
horizontally
even
for
a
few
moments
a
single
muscle
the
deltoid
in
this
case
does
most
of
the
work
even
in
a
vigorous
man
this
muscle
can
act
no
longer
than
four
to
six
minutes
before
the
arm
drops
helpless
we
may
prolong
the
period
by
a
strong
effort
of
the
will
but
a
time
soon
comes
when
by
no
possible
effort
are
we
able
to
hold
out
the
arm
the
muscle
is
said
to
be
fatigued
it
has
by
no
means
lost
its
contractile
power
for
if
we
apply
a
strong
electric
stimulus
to
it
the
fatigue
seems
to
disappear
thus
we
see
the
functional
power
of
a
muscle
has
a
definite
limit
and
in
fatigue
that
limit
is
reached
illustration
fig
gymnasium
from
a
photograph
the
strength
of
the
muscle
its
physical
condition
the
work
it
has
done
and
the
mental
condition
of
the
individual
all
modify
the
state
of
fatigue
in
those
difficult
acts
which
involve
a
special
effort
of
the
will
the
matter
of
nerve
exhaustion
is
largely
concerned
thus
the
incessant
movements
in
dance
result
in
comparatively
little
fatigue
because
there
is
no
association
of
the
brain
with
the
muscular
action
if
a
strong
man
should
attempt
to
perform
voluntarily
the
same
movements
he
would
soon
have
to
rest
none
of
the
movements
which
are
performed
independently
of
the
will
as
the
and
breathing
movements
ever
involve
the
sensation
of
fatigue
as
a
result
of
fatigue
the
normal
irritability
of
muscular
tissue
becomes
weakened
and
its
force
of
contraction
is
lessened
there
is
also
often
noticed
in
fatigue
a
peculiar
tremor
of
the
muscles
rendering
their
movements
uncertain
the
stiffness
of
the
muscles
which
comes
on
during
severe
exercise
or
the
day
after
are
familiar
results
of
fatigue
this
sense
of
fatigue
should
put
us
on
guard
against
danger
it
is
a
kind
of
regulator
which
serves
in
the
ordinary
actions
of
life
to
warn
us
not
to
exceed
the
limits
of
useful
exercise
fatigue
summons
us
to
rest
long
before
all
the
force
of
the
motor
organs
has
been
expended
just
as
the
sensation
of
hunger
warns
us
that
we
need
food
long
before
the
body
has
become
weak
from
the
lack
of
nourishment
we
should
never
forget
that
it
is
highly
essential
to
maintain
an
unused
reserve
of
power
just
as
a
cautious
merchant
always
keeps
at
the
bank
an
unexpended
balance
of
money
if
he
overspends
his
money
he
is
bankrupt
and
the
person
who
overspends
his
strength
is
for
the
time
physically
bankrupt
in
each
case
the
process
of
recovery
is
slow
and
painful
rest
for
the
muscles
rest
is
necessary
for
the
tissues
that
they
may
repair
the
losses
sustained
by
work
that
is
a
period
of
rest
must
alternate
with
a
period
of
activity
even
the
heart
beating
ceaselessly
has
its
periods
of
absolute
rest
to
alternate
with
those
of
work
a
is
always
slowly
but
surely
losing
its
fitness
for
work
at
last
it
stops
from
the
need
of
repair
unlike
the
engine
the
body
is
constantly
renewing
itself
and
undergoing
continual
repair
were
it
not
for
this
power
to
repair
and
renew
its
various
tissues
the
body
would
soon
be
worn
out
this
repair
is
really
a
renovation
of
the
structure
rest
and
work
are
relative
terms
directly
opposed
to
each
other
work
quickens
the
pulse
and
the
respiration
while
rest
slows
both
during
sleep
the
voluntary
muscles
are
relaxed
and
those
of
organic
life
work
with
less
energy
the
pulse
and
the
respiration
are
less
frequent
and
the
temperature
lower
than
when
awake
hence
sleep
sweet
restorer
may
be
regarded
as
a
complete
rest
the
periods
of
rest
should
vary
with
the
kind
of
exercise
thus
exercise
which
produces
breathlessness
requires
frequent
but
short
rests
the
trained
runner
finding
his
respiration
embarrassed
stops
a
moment
to
regain
his
breath
exercises
of
endurance
cause
fatigue
less
quickly
than
those
of
speed
but
require
longer
rest
thus
a
man
not
used
to
long
distances
may
walk
a
number
of
hours
without
stopping
but
while
fatigue
is
slow
to
result
it
is
also
slow
to
disappear
hence
a
lengthy
period
of
rest
is
necessary
before
he
is
able
to
renew
his
journey
amount
of
physical
exercise
required
the
amount
of
physical
exercise
that
can
be
safely
performed
by
each
person
is
a
most
important
and
practical
question
no
rule
can
be
laid
down
for
what
one
person
bears
well
may
prove
very
injurious
to
another
to
a
certain
extent
each
must
be
guided
by
his
own
judgment
if
after
taking
exercise
we
feel
fatigued
and
irritable
are
subject
to
headache
and
sleeplessness
or
find
it
difficult
to
apply
the
mind
to
its
work
it
is
plain
that
we
have
been
taxing
our
strength
unduly
and
the
warnings
should
be
heeded
age
is
an
important
factor
in
the
problem
as
a
young
man
may
do
with
ease
and
safety
what
might
be
injurious
to
an
older
person
in
youth
when
the
body
is
making
its
most
active
development
the
judicious
use
of
games
sports
and
gymnastics
is
most
beneficial
in
advanced
life
both
the
power
and
the
inclination
for
exercise
fail
but
even
then
effort
should
be
made
to
take
a
certain
reasonable
amount
of
exercise
abundant
evidence
shows
that
physical
development
is
most
active
from
thirteen
to
seventeen
years
of
age
this
manifests
itself
clearly
by
increase
in
weight
hence
this
period
of
life
is
of
great
consequence
if
at
this
age
a
boy
or
girl
is
subjected
to
undue
physical
strain
the
development
may
suffer
the
growth
be
retarded

from

photograph
the
proper
amount
of
exercise
must
vary
greatly
with
circumstances
it
may
be
laid
down
as
a
fairly
safe
rule
that
a
person
of
average
height
and
weight
engaged
in
study
or
in
any
indoor
or
sedentary
occupation
should
take
an
amount
of
exercise
equivalent
to
walking
five
or
six
miles
a
day
growing
children
as
a
rule
take
more
exercise
than
this
while
most
men
working
indoors
take
far
less
and
many
women
take
less
exercise
than
men
exercise
may
be
varied
in
many
ways
the
more
the
better
but
for
the
most
part
it
should
always
be
taken
in
the
open
air
time
for
exercise
it
is
not
prudent
to
do
hard
work
or
take
severe
exercise
just
before
or
just
after
a
full
meal
the
best
time
is
one
or
two
hours
after
a
meal
vigorous
exercise
while
the
stomach
is
busily
digesting
food
may
prove
injurious
and
is
apt
to
result
sooner
or
later
in
dyspepsia
on
the
other
hand
severe
exercise
should
not
be
taken
on
an
empty
stomach
those
who
do
much
work
or
study
before
breakfast
should
first
take
a
light
lunch
just
enough
to
prevent
any
faint
feeling
with
this
precaution
there
is
no
better
time
for
moderate
exercise
than
the
early
morning
in
the
case
of
children
physical
exercises
should
not
be
undertaken
when
they
are
overtired
or
hungry
neither
is
it
judicious
for
adults
to
take
vigorous
exercise
in
the
evening
after
a
long
and
arduous
work
walking
running
and
jumping
walking
is
generally
regarded
as
the
simplest
and
most
convenient
mode
of
taking
exercise
man
is
essentially
a
walking
animal
when
taken
with
a
special
object
in
view
it
is
the
best
and
most
pleasant
of
all
physical
activities
it
is
suited
for
individuals
of
all
ages
and
occupations
and
for
residents
of
every
climate
the
child
the
athlete
and
the
aged
are
all
able
to
indulge
in
this
simple
and
effective
means
of
keeping
the
body
in
health
in
walking
the
muscles
of
the
entire
body
are
brought
into
action
and
the
movements
of
breathing
and
the
circulation
of
the
blood
are
increased
the
body
should
be
erect
the
chest
thrown
out
the
head
and
shoulders
held
back
and
the
stride
long
and
elastic
it
is
an
excellent
custom
to
add
to
the
usefulness
of
this
fine
exercise
by
deep
voluntary
inhalations
of
pure
air
running
is
an
excellent
exercise
for
children
and
young
people
but
should
be
sparingly
indulged
in
after
the
age
of
if
it
be
accompanied
with
a
feeling
of
faintness
breathlessness
and
palpitation
of
the
heart
the
exercise
is
too
severe
and
its
continuance
may
do
serious
harm
running
as
an
exercise
is
beneficial
to
those
who
have
kept
themselves
in
practice
and
in
sound
condition
it
brings
into
play
nearly
every
muscle
of
the
body
and
thus
serves
to
develop
the
power
of
endurance
as
well
as
strength
and
capacity
for
rapid
movement
jumping
may
well
be
left
to
boys
and
young
men
under
twenty
but
skipping
with
a
rope
allied
to
jumping
is
an
admirable
and
beneficial
form
of
exercise
it
brings
into
action
many
muscles
without
putting
undue
strain
upon
any
particular
group
skating
swimming
and
rowing
skating
is
a
delightful
and
invigorating
exercise
it
calls
into
play
a
great
variety
of
muscles
and
is
admirably
adapted
for
almost
all
ages
it
strengthens
the
ankles
and
helps
give
an
easy
and
graceful
carriage
to
the
body
skating
is
especially
valuable
as
it
can
be
enjoyed
when
other
exercises
are
not
convenient
every
child
above
ten
years
of
age
should
be
taught
to
swim
the
art
once
mastered
is
never
forgotten
it
calls
into
use
a
wide
combination
of
muscles
this
accomplishment
so
easily
learned
should
be
a
part
of
our
education
as
well
as
baseball
or
bicycling
as
it
may
chance
to
any
one
to
save
his
own
life
or
that
of
a
companion
in
many
respects
rowing
is
one
of
the
most
perfect
exercises
at
our
command
it
expands
the
chest
strengthens
the
body
and
gives
tone
to
the
muscles
of
the
abdomen
it
is
very
suitable
for
girls
and
women
as
no
other
exercise
is
so
well
adapted
to
remedy
the
muscular
defects
so
marked
in
their
sex
even
elderly
persons
can
row
day
after
day
without
difficulty
the
degree
of
muscular
effort
required
can
be
regulated
so
that
those
with
weak
hearts
and
weak
lungs
can
adjust
themselves
to
the
exercise
bicycling
as
an
exercise
the
bicycle
as
a
means
of
taking
exercise
has
come
into
popular
use
with
remarkable
rapidity
sharp
competition
bids
fair
to
make
the
wheel
more
popular
and
less
expensive
than
ever
its
phenomenal
use
by
persons
of
all
ages
and
in
all
stations
of
life
is
proof
of
the
enthusiasm
with
which
this
athletic
exercise
is
employed
by
women
as
well
as
by
men
mechanical
skill
has
removed
most
of
the
risks
to
health
and
person
which
once
existed
a
good
machine
used
by
its
owner
with
judgment
is
the
most
convenient
the
safest
and
the
least
expensive
means
of
traveling
for
pleasure
or
exercise
it
is
doing
more
than
any
other
form
of
exercise
to
improve
the
bodily
condition
of
thousands
whose
occupations
confine
them
all
day
to
sedentary
work
dependent
upon
no
one
but
himself
the
cyclist
has
his
means
of
exercise
always
at
hand
no
preparation
is
necessary
to
take
a
spin
of
ten
miles
or
so
on
the
road
during
a
summer
evening
or
before
breakfast
bicycling
brings
into
active
use
the
muscles
of
the
legs
as
well
as
those
of
the
trunk
and
arms
it
seems
to
benefit
those
who
suffer
from
dyspepsia
constipation
and
functional
disorders
of
the
liver
a
special
caution
must
be
used
against
overdoing
in
cycling
for
the
temptation
by
rivalry
making
a
record
by
social
competition
on
the
road
is
stronger
in
this
form
of
exercise
than
in
any
other
especially
for
young
folks
many
cases
have
occurred
of
permanent
injury
and
even
loss
of
life
from
collapse
simply
by
excessive
exertion
and
exhaustion
outdoor
games
and
physical
education
while
outdoor
games
are
not
necessary
to
maintain
health
yet
we
can
scarcely
overestimate
the
part
that
the
great
games
of
baseball
football
tennis
golf
and
croquet
play
in
the
physical
development
of
young
people
when
played
in
moderation
and
under
suitable
conditions
they
are
most
useful
and
beneficial
exercises
they
are
played
in
the
open
air
and
demand
a
great
variety
of
vigorous
muscular
movement
with
a
considerable
amount
of
skill
and
adroitness
of
action
these
games
not
only
involve
healthful
exercise
but
develop
all
those
manly
and
wholesome
qualities
so
essential
to
success
in
life
a
vigorous
body
is
essential
to
success
but
equally
important
are
readiness
of
action
sound
judgment
good
temper
personal
courage
a
sense
of
fair
play
and
above
all
a
spirit
of
honor
outdoor
games
when
played
in
a
reasonable
and
honorable
manner
are
most
efficient
and
practical
means
to
develop
these
qualities
in
young
people
the
school
and
physical
education
the
advantages
to
be
derived
during
the
school
period
from
the
proper
care
and
development
of
the
body
should
be
understood
and
appreciated
by
school
officials
teachers
and
parents
the
school
period
is
the
best
time
to
shape
the
lives
of
pupils
not
mentally
or
morally
alone
but
physically
as
well
this
is
the
time
by
the
use
of
a
few
daily
exercises
at
school
to
draw
back
the
rounding
shoulders
to
form
the
habit
of
sitting
and
standing
erect
to
build
up
strong
and
comely
arms
and
chests
and
otherwise
to
train
pupils
to
those
methods
which
will
serve
to
ripen
them
into
vigorous
and
men
and
women
teachers
can
by
a
little
effort
gain
the
knowledge
requisite
properly
to
instruct
their
pupils
in
a
few
systematic
exercises
gratifying
results
will
follow
just
as
the
teacher
and
pupils
evince
interest
and
judgment
in
the
work
it
is
found
by
experience
that
pupils
are
not
only
quick
to
learn
but
look
forward
eagerly
to
the
physical
exercises
as
an
interesting
change
from
the
routine
of
school
life
there
should
be
a
stated
time
for
these
school
exercises
as
for
any
other
duty
there
can
be
practiced
in
the
schoolroom
a
great
variety
of
interesting
and
useful
exercises
which
call
for
little
or
no
expense

such
exercises
should

more
interfere
with
the
usual
games
than
any
other
study
does
under
no
circumstances
should
the
play

be
curtailed

physical
exercises
of
some
sort
then
should
be
provided
for
pupils
in
our
schools
especially
in
large
towns
and
cities
where
there
is
little
opportunity
for
outdoor
games
and
they
should
form
a
part
of
the
regular
course
of
study
the
object
should
be
the
promotion
of
sound
health
rather
than
the
development
of

feats
of

practical
points
about
physical
exercise
the
main
object
in
undertaking
systematic
and
graduated
physical
exercises
is
not
to
learn
to
do
mere
feats
of
strength
and
skill
but
the
better
to
fit
the
individual
for
the
duties
and
the
work
of
life
exercises
should
be
considered
with
reference
to
their
availability
from
the
standpoint
the
most
beneficial
exercises
ordinarily
are
the
gentle
ones
in
which
no
strain
is
put
upon
the
heart
and
the
respiration
the
special
aim
is
to
secure
the
equal
use
of
all
the
muscles
not
the
development
of
a
few
the
performance
of
feats
of
strength
should
never
come
within
the
scope
of
any
educational
scheme
exercises
which
call
for
sustained
effort
violent
exertion
or
sudden
strain
are
best
avoided
by
those
who
have
had
no
preparation
or
training
regular
exercise
not
sudden
and
occasional
prolonged
exertion
is
necessary
for
health
the
man
or
woman
who
works
in
an
office
or
store
all
the
week
and
on
sunday
or
a
holiday
indulges
in
a
long
spin
on
the
bicycle
often
receives
more
harm
than
good
from
the
exertion
exercise
should
be
taken
so
far
as
is
convenient
in
the
open
air
or
in
a
large
and
room
after
the
more
violent
exercises
as
baseball
football
a
long
ride
on
the
bicycle
or
even
after
a
prolonged
walk
a
warm
bath
should
be
taken
at
the
first
convenient
opportunity
care
should
be
taken
to
rub
down
thoroughly
and
to
change
a
part
or
all
of
the
clothing
exercise
is
comparatively
valueless
until
the
idea
of
taking
it
for
health
is
quite
forgotten
in
the
interest
and
pleasure
excited
by
the
occasion
no
exercise
should
be
carried
to
such
a
degree
as
to
cause
fatigue
or
exhaustion
keep
warmly
clad
after
exercise
avoid
chills
and
always
stop
exercising
as
soon
as
fatigue
is
felt
wear
clothing
which
allows
free
play
to
all
the
muscles
of
the

the
clothing
should
be

the

has
done
much
to
call
the
attention
of
the
public
to
the
usefulness

importance
of
a
more
thorough
and
systematic
use
of
physical
exercises
both
at

in

it
is
not
within

of
this
book
to
describe
the
various
systems
of
gymnastic
and
calisthenic
exercises
now
in
common
use
in
this
country
for
the
most
part
they
have
been
modified

rearranged
from

from

the

is
often
compared
to
a

order
an
engine
uses
up
fuel
and
water
to
obtain
from
them
the
energy
necessary
to
do
its
work
so
we
consume
within
our
bodies
certain
nutritious
substances
to
obtain
from
them
the
energy
necessary
for
our
activities
just
as
the
energy
for
the
working
of
the
engine
is
obtained
from
steam
by
the
combustion
of
fuel
so
the
energy
possessed
by
our
bodies
results
from
the
combustion
or
oxidation
within
us
of
the
food
we
eat
unless
this
energy
is
provided
for
the
body
it
will
have
but
little
power
of
doing
work
and
like
an
engine
without
steam
must
soon
become
motionless
waste
and
repair
a

the
first
stroke
of
its

to
wear
out
and
before
long
needs

all
work
involves
waste
the

unless
kept
in
thorough
repair
would
soon
stop
so
with
our

in
their
living

the

down
complex
substances

being
broken
up
into

so
long
as
life
lasts
food
must
be
brought
to
the
tissues
and
waste
products
carried
away
from

it
is
impossible
to
move
a

even
to

without
some
minute
part
of
the
muscular
or
brain
tissue
becoming
of
no
further
use
in
the
body
the
transformation
of
dead
matter
into
living
tissue
is
the
miracle
which
life
presents
even
in
its
lowest
forms
in
childhood
the
waste
is
small
and
the
amount
of
food
taken
is
more
than
sufficient
to
repair
the
loss
some
of
the
extra
food
is
used
in
building
up
the
body
especially
the
muscles
as
we
shall
learn
in
chapter
food
is
also
required
to
maintain
the
bodily
heat
food
then
is
necessary
for
the
production
of
energy
for
the
repair
of
the
body
for
the
building
up
of
the
tissues
and
for
the
maintenance
of
bodily
heat
nature
of
the
waste
material
an
ordinarily
healthy
person
passes
daily
on
an
average
by
the
kidneys
about
ounces
of
waste
material
of
which
per
cent
is
water
and
from
the
intestines
on
an
average
ounces
a
large
proportion
of
which
is
water
by
the
skin
in
the
shape
of
sweat
and
insensible
perspiration
there
is
cast
out
about
ounces
of
which
per
cent
is
water
and
by
the
lungs
about
ounces
of
which
are
water
and
the
remainder
carbon
dioxid
now
if
we
omit
an
estimate
of
the
undigestible
remains
of
the
food
we
find
that
the
main
bulk
of
what
daily
leaves
the
body
consists
of
water
carbon
dioxid
and
certain
solid
matters
contained
in
solution
in
the
renal
secretion
and
the
sweat
the
chief
of
these
solid
matters
is
urea
a
complex
product
made
up
of
four
elements
hydrogen
oxygen
and
nitrogen
water
contains
only
two
elements
hydrogen
and
oxygen
and
carbon
dioxid
also
has
only
two
carbon
and
oxygen
hence
what
we
daily
cast
out
of
our
bodies
consists
essentially
of
these
four
elements
in
the
form
mainly
of
water
carbon
dioxid
and
urea
these
waste
products
represent
the
oxidation
that
has
taken
place
in
the
tissues
in
producing
the
energy
necessary
for
the
bodily
activities
just
as
the
smoke
ashes
clinkers
and
steam
represent
the
consumption
of
fuel
and
water
in
the
engine
plainly
therefore
if
we
could
restore
to
the
body
a
supply
of
these
four
elements
equivalent
to
that
cast
out
we
could
make
up
for
the
waste
the
object
of
food
then
is
to
restore
to
the
body
an
amount
of
the
four
elements
equal
to
that
consumed
in
other
words
and
briefly
the
purpose
of
food
is
to
supply
the
waste
of
the
tissues
and
to
maintain
the
normal
composition
of
the
blood
classification
of
foods
foods
may
be
conveniently
divided
into
four
great
classes
to
which
the
name
or
alimentary
principles
has
been
given
they
correspond
to
the
chief
of
which
the
body
consists
to
one
or
the
other
of
these
classes
all
available
foods
belong
the
classification
of
usually
given
is
as
follows
proteids
or
nitrogenous
foods
starches
and
sugars
or
carbohydrates
fats
and
oils
inorganic
or
mineral
foods
salt
proteids
or
nitrogenous
foods
the
proteids
frequently
spoken
of
as
the
nitrogenous
foods
are
rich
in
one
or
more
of
the
following
organic
substances
albumen
casein
fibrin
gelatine
myosin
gluten
and
legumin
the
type
of
this
class
of
foods
is
albumen
well
known
as
the
white
of
an
egg
the
serum
of
the
blood
is
very
rich
in
albumen
as
is
lean
meat
the
curd
of
milk
consists
mainly
of
casein
fibrin
exists
largely
in
blood
and
flesh
foods
gelatine
is
obtained
from
the
animal
parts
of
bones
and
connective
tissue
by
prolonged
boiling
one
of
the
chief
constituents
of
muscular
fiber
is
myosin
gluten
exists
largely
in
the
cereals
wheat
barley
oats
and
rye
the
proteid
principle
of
peas
and
beans
is
legumin
a
substance
resembling
casein
as
the
name
implies
the
proteids
or
nitrogenous
foods
contain
nitrogen
carbohydrates
and
fats
on
the
contrary
do
not
contain
nitrogen
the
principal
proteid
are
milk
eggs
flesh
foods
of
all
kinds
fish
and
the
cereals
among
vegetable
foods
peas
and
beans
are
rich
in
proteids
the
essential
use
of
the
proteids
to
the
tissues
is
to
supply
the
material
from
which
the
new
proteid
tissue
is
made
or
the
old
proteid
tissue
is
repaired
they
are
also
valuable
as
sources
of
energy
to
the
body
now
as
the
proteid
part
of
its
molecule
is
the
most
important
constituent
of
living
matter
it
is
evident
that
proteid
food
is
an
absolute
necessity
if
our
diet
contained
no
proteids
the
tissues
of
the
body
would
gradually
waste
away
and
death
from
starvation
would
result
all
the
are
necessary
in
one
way
or
another
to
the
preservation
of
perfect
health
but
proteids
together
with
a
certain
proportion
of
water
and
inorganic
salts
are
absolutely
necessary
for
the
bare
maintenance
of
animal
is
for
the
formation
and
preservation
of
living
protoplasm
starches
and
sugars
the
starches
sugars
and
gums
also
known
as
carbohydrates
enter
largely
into
the
composition
of
foods
of
vegetable
origin
they
contain
no
nitrogen
but
the
three
elements
carbon
hydrogen
and
oxygen
the
last
two
in
the
same
proportion
as
in
water
the
starches
are
widely
distributed
throughout
the
vegetable
kingdom
they
are
abundant
in
potatoes
and
the
cereals
and
in
arrowroot
rice
sago
and
tapioca
starch
probably
stands
first
in
importance
among
the
various
vegetable
foods
the
sugars
are
also
widely
distributed
substances
and
include
the
cane
grape
malt
maple
and
milk
sugars
here
also
belong
the
gums
and
cellulose
found
in
fruit
cereals
and
all
vegetables
which
form
the
basis
of
the
plant
cells
and
fibers
honey
molasses
and
manna
are
included
in
this
class
the
physiological
value
of
the
starches
and
sugars
lies
in
the
fact
that
they
are
oxidized
in
the
body
and
a
certain
amount
of
energy
is
thereby
liberated
the
energy
of
muscular
work
and
of
the
heat
of
the
body
comes
largely
from
the
oxidation
or
destruction
of
this
class
of
foods
now
inasmuch
as
we
are
continually
giving
off
energy
from
the
body
chiefly
in
the
form
of
muscular
work
and
heat
it
is
evident
that
material
for
the
production
of
this
energy
must
be
taken
in
the
food
the
carbohydrates
constitute
the
bulk
of
our
ordinary
food
fats
and
oils
these
include
not
only
the
ordinary
fats
of
meat
but
many
animal
and
vegetable
oils
they
are
alike
in
chemical
composition
consisting
of
carbon
and
hydrogen
with
a
little
oxygen
and
no
nitrogen
the
principal
kinds
of
fat
used
as
food
are
the
fat
of
meat
butter
suet
and
lard
but
in
many
parts
of
the
world
various
vegetable
oils
are
largely
used
as
the
olive
palm
cotton
seed
cocoanut
and
almond
the
use
of
the
fats
in
the
body
is
essentially
the
same
as
that
of
the
starches
and
sugars
weight
for
weight
they
are
more
valuable
than
the
carbohydrates
as
sources
of
energy
but
the
latter
are
more
easily
digested
and
more
easily
oxidized
in
the
body
an
important
use
of
fatty
foods
is
for
the
maintenance
of
the
bodily
heat
the
inhabitants
of
arctic
regions
are
thus
enabled
by
large
use
of
the
fat
and
oil
from
the
animals
they
devour
to
endure
safely
the
severe
cold
then
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
fat
helps
the
digestion
of
other
foods
for
it
is
found
that
the
body
is
better
nourished
when
the
fats
are
used
as
food
when
more
fat
is
consumed
than
is
required
to
keep
up
the
bodily
heat
and
to
yield
working
power
the
excess
is
stored
up
in
various
parts
of
the
body
making
a
sort
of
reserve
fuel
which
may
be
drawn
upon
at
any
future
time
saline
or
mineral
foods
all
food
contains
besides
the
substances
having
potential
energy
as
described
certain
saline
matters
water
and
salts
are
not
usually
considered
foods
but
the
results
of
scientific
research
as
well
as
the
experience
of
life
show
that
these
substances
are
absolutely
necessary
to
the
body
the
principal
mineral
foods
are
salt
lime
iron
magnesia
phosphorus
potash
and
water
except
common
salt
and
water
these
substances
are
usually
taken
only
in
combination
with
other
foods
these
saline
matters
are
essential
to
health
and
when
not
present
in
due
proportion
nutrition
is
disturbed
if
a
dog
be
fed
on
food
freed
from
all
salines
but
otherwise
containing
proper
nutrients
he
soon
suffers
from
weakness
after
a
time
amounting
to
paralysis
and
often
dies
in
convulsions
about
grains
of
common
salt
are
required
daily
by
an
adult
but
a
large
proportion
of
this
is
in
our
food
phosphate
of
lime
is
obtained
from
milk
and
meats
and
carbonate
of
lime
from
the
hard
water
we
drink
both
are
required
for
the
bones
and
teeth
the
salts
of
potash
which
assist
in
purifying
the
blood
are
obtained
from
vegetables
and
fruits
an
iron
salt
is
found
in
most
foods
and
sulphur
in
the
yolk
of
eggs
water
water
is
of
use
chiefly
as
a
solvent
and
while
not
strictly
a
food
is
necessary
to
life
it
enters
into
the
construction
of
every
tissue
and
is
constantly
being
removed
from
the
body
by
every
channel
of
waste
as
a
solvent
water
aids
digestion
and
as
it

is
also
high
varying
from

the
most
common

used
in
this
country
are
beef
mutton
veal
pork
poultry
and
game
beef
contains
less
fat
and
is
more
nutritious
than
either
mutton
or
pork
mutton
has
a
fine
flavor
and
is
easily
digested
veal
and
lamb
though
more
tender
are
less
easily
digested
pork
contains
much
fat
and
its
fiber
is
hard
so
that
it
is
the
most
difficult
to
digest
of
all
the
meats
poultry
and
game
have
usually
a
small
proportion
of
fat
but
are
rich
in
phosphates
and
are
valued
for
their
flavor
eggs
consisting
of
about
water
and
the
rest
albumen
and
fat
eggs
are
often
spoken
of
as
typical
natural

the
white
of

egg
is
chiefly
albumen
with
traces
of

is
due
partly
to

but
their
chief
use
is
to
furnish
starches
sugars

the
vegetable
foods
indirectly
supply
the
body
with
a
large
amount
of
water
which
they
absorb
in
cooking
proteid
vegetable
foods
the
most
important
proteid
vegetable
foods
are
those
derived
from
the
grains
of
cereals
and
certain
leguminous
seeds
as
peas
and
beans
the
grains
when
ground
make
the
various
flours
or

they
contain
a
large
quantity
of
starch
a
proteid
substance
peculiar
to
them
called
gluten
and
mineral
salts
especially
phosphate
of

peas
and

contain
a
smaller
proportion
of

has
starch
sugar
and
everything
to

oatmeal
is
rich
in
proteids
in
some
countries
as
scotland
it
forms
an
important

it
is
unfit

butter
is
one
of
the
most
digestible
of
animal
fats
agreeable
and
delicate
in
flavor
and
is
on
this
account
much
used
as
a
wholesome
food
various
substitutes
have
recently
come
into
use
these
are
all
made
from
animal
fat
chiefly
that
of
beef
and
are
known
as
butterine
oleomargarine
and
by
other
trade
names
these
preparations
if
properly
made
are
wholesome
and
may
be
useful
substitutes
for
butter
from
which
they
differ
but
little
in
composition
garden
vegetables
various
green
fresh
and
succulent
vegetables
form
an
essential
part
of
our
diet
they
are
of
importance
not
so
much
on
account
of
their
nutritious
elements
which
are
usually
small
as
for
the
salts
they
supply
especially
the
salts
of
potash
it
is
a
fact
that
the
continued
use
of
a
diet
from
which
fresh
vegetables
are
excluded
leads
to
a
disease
known
as
scurvy
they
are
also
used
for
the
agreeable
flavor
possessed
by
many
and
the
pleasant
variety
and
relish
they
give
to
the
food
the
undigested
residue
left
by
all
green
vegetables
affords
a
useful
stimulus
to
intestinal
contraction
and
tends
to
promote
the
regular
action
of
the
bowels
fruits
a
great
variety
of
fruits
both
fresh
and
dry
is
used
as
food
or
as
luxuries
they
are
of
little
nutritive
value
containing
as
they
do
much
water
and
only
a
small
amount
of
proteid
but
are
of
use
chiefly
for
the
sugar
vegetable
acids
and
salts
they
contain
in
moderate
quantity
fruits
are
a
useful
addition
to
our
regular
diet
they
are
cooling
and
refreshing
of
agreeable
flavor
and
tend
to
prevent
constipation
their
flavor
and
juiciness
serve
to
stimulate
a
weak
appetite
and
to
give
variety
to
an
otherwise
heavy
diet
if
eaten
in
excess
especially
in
an
unripe
or
an
overripe
state
fruits
may
occasion
a
disturbance
of
the
stomach
and
bowels
often
of
a
severe
form
condiments
the
refinements
of
cookery
as
well
as
the
craving
of
the
appetite
demand
many
articles
which
can
not
be
classed
strictly
as
foods
they
are
called
condiments
and
as
such
may
be
used
in
moderation
they
give
flavor
and
relish
to
food
excite
appetite
and
promote
digestion
condiments
increase
the
pleasure
of
eating
and
by
their
stimulating
properties
promote
secretions
of
the
digestive
fluids
and
excite
the
muscular
contractions
of
the
alimentary
canal
the
condiments
are
salt
vinegar
pepper
ginger
nutmeg
cloves
and
various
substances
containing
ethereal
oils
and
aromatics
their
excessive
use
is
calculated
to
excite
irritation
and
disorder
of
the
digestive
organs
salt
the
most
important
and
extensively
used
of
the
condiments
is
common
salt
it
exists
in
all
ordinary
articles
of
diet
but
in
quantities
not
sufficient
to
meet
the
wants
of
the
bodily
tissues
hence
it
is
added
to
many
articles
of
food
it
improves
their
flavor
promotes
certain
digestive
secretions
and
meets
the
nutritive
demands
of
the
body
the
use
of
salt
seems
based
upon
an
instinctive
demand
of
the
system
for
something
necessary
for
the
full
performance
of
its
functions
food
without
salt
however
nutritious
in
other
respects
is
taken
with
reluctance
and
digested
with
difficulty
salt
has
always
played
an
important
and
picturesque
part
in
the
history
of
dietetics
reference
to
its
worth
and
necessity
abounds
in
sacred
and
profane
history
in
ancient
times
salt
was
the
first
thing
placed
on
the
table
and
the
last
removed
the
place
at
the
long
table
above
or
below
the
salt
indicated
rank
it
was
everywhere
the
emblem
of
hospitality
in
parts
of
africa
it
is
so
scarce
that
it
is
worth
its
weight
in
gold
and
is
actually
used
as
money
torture
was
inflicted
upon
prisoners
of
state
in
olden
times
by
limiting
the
food
to
water
and
bread
without
salt
so
intense
may
this
craving
for
salt
become
that
men
have
often
risked
their
liberty
and
even
their
lives
to
obtain
it
water
the
most
important
natural
beverage
is
pure
water
in
fact
it
is
the
only
one
required
man
has
however
from
the
earliest
times
preferred
and
daily
used
a
variety
of
artificial
drinks
among
which
are
tea
coffee
and
cocoa
all
beverages
except
certain
strong
alcoholic
liquors
consist
almost
entirely
of
water
it
is
a
large
element
of
solid
foods
and
our
bodies
are
made
up
to
a
great
extent
of
water
everything
taken
into
the
circulating
fluids
of
the
body
or
eliminated
from
them
is
done
through
the
agency
of
water
as
a
solvent
it
is
indispensable
in
all
the
activities
of
the
body
it
has
been
estimated
that
an
adult
loses
by
means
of
the
lungs
skin
and
kidneys
about
eighty
ounces
of
water
every
hours
to
restore
this
loss
about
four
pints
must
be
taken
daily
about
one
pint
of
this
is
obtained
from
the
food
we
eat
the
remaining
three
pints
being
taken
as
drink
one
of
the
best
ways
of
supplying
water
to
the
body
is
by
drinking
it
in
its
pure
state
when
its
solvent
properties
can
be
completely
utilized
the
amount
of
water
consumed
depends
largely
upon
the
amount
of
work
performed
by
the
body
and
upon
the
temperature
being
one
of
the
essential
elements
of
the
body
it
is
highly
important
that
water
should
be
free
from
harmful
impurities
if
it
contain
the
germs
of
disease
sickness
may
follow
its
use
without
doubt
the
most
important
factor
in
the
spread
of
disease
is
with
the
exception
of
impure
air
impure
water
the
chief
agent
in
the
spread
of
typhoid
fever
is
impure
water
so
with
cholera
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
filthy
water
is
an
agent
in
the
spread
of
this
terrible
disease
tea
coffee
and
cocoa
the
active
principle
of
tea
is
called
theine
that
of
coffee
caffeine
and
of
cocoa
theobromine
they
also
contain
an
aromatic
volatile
oil
to
which
they
owe
their
distinctive
flavor
tea
and
coffee
also
contain
an
astringent
called
tannin
which
gives
the
peculiar
bitter
taste
to
the
infusions
when
steeped
too
long
in
cocoa
the
fat
known
as
cocoa
butter
amounts
to
fifty
per
cent
tea
it
has
been
estimated
that
of
the
human
race
now
use
tea
either
habitually
or
occasionally
its
use
is
a
prolific
source
of
indigestion
palpitation
of
the
heart
persistent
wakefulness
and
of
other
disorders
when
used
at
all
it
should
be
only
in
moderation
persons
who
can
not
use
it
without
feeling
its
hurtful
effects
should
leave
it
alone
it
should
not
be
taken
on
an
empty
stomach
nor
sipped
after
every
mouthful
of
food
coffee
coffee
often
disturbs
the
rhythm
of
the
heart
and
causes
palpitation
taken
at
night
coffee
often
causes
wakefulness
this
effect
is
so
well
known
that
it
is
often
employed
to
prevent
sleep
immoderate
use
of
strong
coffee
may
produce
other
toxic
effects
such
as
muscular
tremors
nervous
anxiety
palpitation
and
various
uncomfortable
feelings
in
the
cardiac
region
some
persons
can
not
drink
even
a
small
amount
of
tea
or
coffee
without
these
unpleasant
effects
these
favorite
beverages
are
unsuitable
for
young
people
cocoa
the
beverage
known
as
cocoa
comes
from
the
seeds
of
the
which
are
roasted
like
the
coffee
berries
to
develop
the
aroma
chocolate
is
manufactured
cocoa
and
flavors
being
added
to
the
prepared
seeds
chocolate
is
a
convenient
and
palatable
form
of
highly
nutritious
food
for
those
with
whom
tea
and
coffee
disagree
it
may
be
an
agreeable
beverage
the
large
quantity
of
fat
which
it
contains
however
often
causes
it
to
be
somewhat
indigestible
alcoholic
beverages
there
is
a
class
of
liquids
which
are
certainly
not
properly
food
or
drink
but
being
so
commonly
used
as
beverages
they
seem
to
require
special
notice
in
this
chapter
in
view
of
the
great
variety
of
alcoholic
beverages
the
prevalence
of
their
use
and
the
very
remarkable
deleterious
effects
they
produce
upon
the
bodily
organism
they
imperatively
demand
our
most
careful
attention
both
from
a
physiological
and
an
hygienic
point
of
view
nature
of
alcohol
the
ceaseless
action
of
minute
forms
of
plant
life
in
bringing
about
the
decomposition
of
the
elaborated
products
of
organized
plant
or
animal
structures
will
be
described
in
more
detail
secs
all
such
work
of
vegetable
organisms
whether
going
on
in
the
moulding
cheese
in
the
souring
of
milk
in
putrefying
meat
in
rotting
fruit
or
in
decomposing
fruit
juice
is
essentially
one
of
fermentation
caused
by
these
minute
forms
of
plant
life
there
are
many
kinds
of
fermentation
each
with
its
own
special
form
of
minute
plant
life
or
in
this
section
we
are
more
especially
concerned
about
that
fermentation
which
results
from
the
decomposition
of
sweet
fruit
plant
or
other
vegetable
juices
which
are
composed
largely
of
water
containing
sugar
and
flavoring
matters
this
special
form
of
fermentation
is
known
as
alcoholic
or
vinous
fermentation
and
the
that
cause
it
are
familiarly
termed
alcoholic
ferments
the
botanist
classes
them
as
of
which
there
are
several
varieties
germs
of
are
found
on
the
surfaces
and
stems
of
fruit
as
it
is
ripening
while
the
fruit
remains
whole
these
germs
have
no
power
to
invade
the
juice
and
even
when
the
skins
are
broken
the
conditions
are
less
favorable
for
their
work
than
for
that
of
the
moulds
which
are
the
cause
of
the
rotting
of
fruit
but
when
fruit
is
crushed
and
its
juice
pressed
out
the
are
carried
into
it
where
they
can
not
get
the
oxygen
they
need
from
the
air
they
are
then
able
to
obtain
oxygen
by
taking
it
from
the
sugar
of
the
juice
by
so
doing
they
cause
a
breaking
up
of
the
sugar
and
a
rearrangement
of
its
elements
two
new
substances
are
formed
in
this
decomposition
of
sugar
carbon
dioxid
which
arises
from
the
liquid
in
tiny
bubbles
and
alcohol
a
poison
which
remains
in
the
fermenting
fluid
now
we
must
remember
that
fermentation
entirely
changes
the
nature
of
the
substance
fermented
for
all
forms
of
decomposition
this
one
law
holds
good
before
alcoholic
fermentation
the
fruit
juice
was
wholesome
and
beneficial
after
fermentation
it
becomes
by
the
action
of
the
minute
germs
a
poisonous
liquid
known
as
alcohol
and
which
forms
an
essential
part
of
all
intoxicating
beverages
taking
advantage
of
this
great
law
of
fermentation
which
dominates
the
realm
of
nature
man
has
devised
means
to
manufacture
various
alcoholic
beverages
from
a
great
variety
of
plant
structures
as
ripe
grapes
pears
apples
and
other
fruits
cane
juices
corn
the
malt
of
barley
rye
wheat
and
other
cereals
the
process
differs
according
to
the
substance
used
and
the
manner
in
which
it
is
treated
but
the
ultimate
outcome
is
always
the
same
the
manufacture
of
a
beverage
containing
a
greater
or
less
proportion
of
alcoholic
poison
by
the
process
of
new
and
stronger
liquor
is
made
beverages
thus
distilled
are
known
as
ardent
spirits
brandy
is
distilled
from
wine
rum
from
fermented
molasses
and
commercial
alcohol
mostly
from
whiskey
the
poisonous
element
in
all
forms
of
intoxicating
drinks
and
the
one
so
fraught
with
danger
to
the
bodily
tissues
is
the
alcohol
they
contain
the
proportion
of
the
alcoholic
ingredient
varies
being
about
per
cent
in
brandy
whiskey
and
rum
about
to
per
cent
in
wines
down
to
per
cent
or
less
in
the
various
beers
and
cider
but
whether
the
proportion
of
alcohol
be
more
or
less
the
same
element
of
danger
is
always
present
effects
of
alcoholic
beverages
upon
the
human
system
one
of
the
most
common
alcoholic
beverages
is
wine
made
from
the
juice
of
grapes
as
the
juice
flows
from
the
crushed
fruit
the
ferments
are
washed
from
the
skins
and
stems
into
the
vat
here
they
bud
and
multiply
rapidly
producing
alcohol
in
a
few
hours
the
juice
that
was
sweet
and
wholesome
while
in
the
grape
is
changed
to
a
poisonous
liquid
capable
of
injuring
whoever
drinks
it
one
of
the
gravest
dangers
of
is
the
power
which
the
alcohol
in
it
has
to
create
a
thirst
which
demands
more
alcohol
the
spread
of
alcoholism
in
countries
is
an
illustration
of
this
fact
another
alcoholic
beverage
common
in
districts
is
cider
until
the
microscope
revealed
the
ferment
germ
on
the
of
the
very
little
was
known
of
the
changes
produced
in
cider
during
the
mysterious
process
of
now
when
we
see
the
bubbles
of
gas
in
the
glass
of
cider
we
know
what
has
produced
them
and
we
know
too
that
a
poison
which
we
do
not
see
is
there
also
in
corresponding
amounts
we
have
learned
too
to
trace
the
wrecked
hopes
of
many
a
family
to
the
alcohol
in
the
cider
which
he
provided
so
freely
supposing
it
harmless
beer
and
other
malt
liquors
are
made
from
grain
by
sprouting
the
grain
which
changes
its
starch
to
sugar
and
then
dissolving
out
the
sugar
with
water
a
sweet
liquid
is
obtained
which
is
fermented
with
yeast
one
kind
of
alcoholic
ferment
some
kinds
of
beer
contain
only
a
small
percentage
of
alcohol
but
these
are
usually
drunk
in
proportionately
large
amounts
the
life
insurance
company
finds
the
beer
drinker
a
precarious
risk
the
surgeon
finds
him
an
unpromising
subject
the
criminal
court
finds
him
conspicuous
in
its
proceedings
the
united
testimony
from
all
these
sources
is
that
beer
is
demoralizing
mentally
morally
and
physically
cooking
the
process
through
which
nearly
all
food
used
by
civilized
man
has
to
pass
before
it
is
eaten
is
known
as
cooking
very
few
articles
indeed
are
consumed
in
their
natural
state
the
exceptions
being
eggs
milk
oysters
fruit
and
a
few
vegetables
man
is
the
only
animal
that
cooks
his
food
although
there
are
savage
races
that
have
no
knowledge
of
cooking
civilized
man
invariably
cooks
most
of
his
food
it
seems
to
be
true
that
as
nations
advance
in
civilization
they
make
a
proportionate
advance
in
the
art
of
cooking
cooking
answers
most
important
purposes
in
connection
with
our
food
especially
from
its
influence
upon
health
it
enables
food
to
be
more
readily
chewed
and
more
easily
digested
thus
a
piece
of
meat
when
raw
is
tough
and
tenacious
but
if
cooked
the
fibers
lose
much
of
their
toughness
while
the
connective
tissues
are
changed
into
a
soft
and
mass
besides
the
meat
is
much
more
readily
masticated
and
acted
upon
by
the
digestive
fluids
so
cooking
makes
vegetables
and
grains
softer
loosens
their
structure
and
enables
the
digestive
juices
readily
to
penetrate
their
substance
cooking
also
improves
or
develops
flavors
in
food
especially
in
animal
foods
and
thus
makes
them
attractive
and
pleasant
to
the
palate
the
appearance
of
uncooked
meat
for
example
is
repulsive
to
our
taste
but
by
the
process
of
cooking
agreeable
flavors
are
developed
which
stimulate
the
appetite
and
the
flow
of
digestive
fluids
another
important
use
of
cooking
is
that
it
kills
any
minute
parasites
or
germs
in
the
raw
food
the
safeguard
of
cooking
thus
effectually
removes
some
important
causes
of
disease
the
warmth
that
cooking
imparts
to
food
is
a
matter
of
no
slight
importance
for
warm
food
is
more
readily
digested
and
therefore
nourishes
the
body
more
quickly
the
art
of
cooking
plays
a
very
important
part
in
the
matter
of
health
and
thus
of
comfort
and
happiness
badly
cooked
and
foods
are
often
the
cause
of
serious
disorders
mere
cooking
is
not
enough
but
good
cooking
is
essential
experiments

the
proteids

as
a
type
of
the
group
of
proteids

take
the
white

so
as
not
to

chapter
vi
digestion
the
purpose
of
digestion
as
we
have
learned
our
bodies
are
subject
to
continual
waste
due
both
to
the
wear
and
tear
of
their
substance
and
to
the
consumption
of
material
for
the
production
of
their
heat
and
energy
the
waste
occurs
in
no
one
part
alone
but
in
all
the
tissues
now
the
blood
comes
into
direct
contact
with
every
one
of
these
tissues
the
ultimate
cells
which
form
the
tissues
are
constantly
being
bathed
by
the
myriads
of
minute
which
bring
to
the
cells
the
raw
material
needed
for
their
continued
renewal
these
cells
are
able
to
select
from
the
nutritive
fluid
whatever
they
require
to
repair
their
waste
and
to
provide
for
their
renewed
activity
at
the
same
time
the
blood
as
it
bathes
the
tissues
sweeps
into
its
current
and
bears
away
the
products
of
waste
thus
the
waste
occurs
in
the
tissues
and
the
means
of
repair
are
obtained
from
the
blood
the
blood
is
thus
continually
being
impoverished
by
having
its
nourishment
drained
away
how
then
is
the
efficiency
of
the
blood
maintained
the
answer
is
that
while
the
ultimate
purpose
of
the
food
is
for
the
repair
of
the
waste
its
immediate
destination
is
the
blood
absorption
of
food
by
the
blood

does
the
food
pass

the

the

fig
mastication
or
chewing
the
first
step
of
the
process
of
digestion
is
mastication
the
cutting
and
grinding
of
the
food
by
the
teeth
effected
by
the
vertical
and
lateral
movements
of
the
lower
jaw
while
the
food
is
thus
being
crushed
it
is
moved
to
and
fro
by
the
varied
movements
of
the
tongue
that
every
part
of
it
may
be
acted
upon
by
the
teeth
the
advantage
of
this
is
obvious
the
more
finely
the
food
is
divided
the
more
easily
will
the
digestive
fluids
reach
every
part
of
it
and
the
more
thoroughly
and
speedily
will
digestion
ensue
the
act
of
chewing
is
simple
and
yet
important
for
if
hurriedly
or
imperfectly
done
the
food
is
in
a
condition
to
cause
disturbance
in
the
digestive
process
thorough
mastication
is
a
necessary
introduction
to
the
more
complicated
changes
which
occur
in
the
later
digestion
the
teeth
the
teeth
are
attached
to
the
upper

lower
maxillary
bones
by
roots
which
sink

the
uses
to
which
they
are
specially
adapted

the
jaws
the
incisors

teeth
number
eight
two
on

they
have
a
single
root

these
are
broad
teeth
with
four

five
points
on

each
molar
has
three

the
food
is
being
chewed
it
is
moistened
with
a
fluid
called
saliva
which
flows
into
the
mouth
from
six
little
glands
there
are
on
each
side
of
the
mouth
three
salivary
glands
which
secrete
the
saliva
from
the
blood
the
parotid
is
situated
on
the
side
of
the
face
in
front
of
the
ear
the
disease
common
in
childhood
during
which
this
gland
becomes
inflamed
and
swollen
is
known
as
the
the
submaxillary
gland
is
placed
below
and
to
the
inner
side
of
the
lower
jaw
and
the
sublingual
is
on
the
floor
of
the
mouth
between
the
tongue
and
the
gums
each
gland
opens
into
the
mouth
by
a
little
duct
these
glands
somewhat
resemble
a
bunch
of
grapes
with
a
tube
for
a
stalk
the
saliva
is
a
colorless
liquid
without
taste
or
smell
its
principal
element
besides
water
is
a
ferment
called
which
has
the
remarkable
property
of
being
able
to
change
starch
into
a
form
of
known
as
maltose
thus
while
the
food
is
being
chewed
another
process
is
going
on
by
which
starch
is
changed
into
sugar
the
saliva
also
moistens
the
food
into
a
mass
for
swallowing
and
aids
in
speech
by
keeping
the
mouth
moist
the
activity
of
the
salivary
glands
is
largely
regulated
by
their
abundant
supply
of
nerves
thus
the
saliva
flows
into
the
mouth
even
at
the
sight
smell
or
thought
of
food
this
is
popularly
known
as
the
mouth
the
flow
of
saliva
may
be
checked
by
nervous
influences
as
sudden
terror
and
undue
anxiety

the
action
of

for
experiment
may
be
obtained
by
chewing
a
piece
of
india
rubber
and
collecting
the
saliva
in
a
test
tube
observe
that
it
is
colorless
and
either
transparent

when
poured

therefore
starch
is
converted
into
a
reducing
sugar
by
the
saliva
this
is
done
by
the
ferment

in

the
pharynx
and
œsophagus
the
dilated
upper
part
of
the
alimentary
canal
is
called
the
pharynx
it
forms
a
blind
sac
above
the
level
of

the
mouth
opens
directly
into
the
pharynx
and
just
above
it
are
two
openings
leading
into
the
posterior
passages
of
the
nose
there
are
also
little
openings
one
on
each
side
from
which
begin
the
eustachian
tubes
which
lead
upward
to
the
ear
cavities
the
windpipe
opens
downward
from
the
pharynx
but
this
communication
can
be
shut
off
by
a
little
plate
or
lid
of
cartilage
the
epiglottis
during
the
act
of
swallowing
this
closes
down
over
the
entrance
to
the
windpipe
like
a

which
by
their

grasp
the
successive
masses
of

swallowed
and
pass
them

deglutition
or

the
food
having
been
well
chewed
and
mixed
with
saliva
is
now
ready
to
be
swallowed
as

the

gathers
it
up

so
as
to
cover

and
prevent
the
passage
of
food
into
the
trachea
there
is
only
one
pathway
for
the
food
to
travel
and
that
is

the
slow
descent
of
the

if
a
horse

be
watched
while

even
liquids
do
not

this

is
of
great
surgical
importance
from
the
fact
that
it
is
subject
to
severe
inflammation
often
resulting
in
an
internal
abscess
which
is
always
dangerous
and
may
prove
fatal
inflammation
of

known
as

quite
familiar
on
account
of
the
many
surgical
operations
performed
of
late
years
for
its
relief
the
large
intestine
passes
upwards
on
the
right
side
as
the
ascending
colon
until
the
under
side
of
the

is
reached

it
passes
to

it
there
turns

the

encircles

the

itself
produce
a

this

of

is
supposed
to
be
designed
for

the

the

of
two

the
various

it
is
held
in

by
five
ligaments
four

which
are
formed

the

reaches

of

but
the

rises
slightly
in

and
the

passes
up
and
is
almost
wholly
covered

the

in

the

is
often
forced

we
have
in

on
a
grand
scale
exactly
the

conditions
as
obtain
in
the
smaller

simpler
glands
the
liver
cells
take
from
the
blood
certain
materials
which
they
elaborate
into
an
important
digestive
fluid
called
the
bile
this
newly
manufactured
fluid
is
carried
away
in
little
canals
called
these
minute
ducts
gradually
unite
and
form
at
last
one
main
duct
which
carries
the
bile
from
the
liver
this
is
known
as
the
hepatic
duct
it
passes
out
on
the
under
side
of
the
liver
and
as
it
approaches
the
intestine
it
meets
at
an
acute
angle
the
cystic
duct
which
proceeds
from
the
gall
bladder
and
forms
with
it
the
common

duct
the

the

where
it
expands
into
a
sac
capable
of
holding
about
two
ounces
of
fluid
and
is
known
as
the
gall
bladder
thus
the
bile
prepared
in
the

of

by
the

cells
is
carried
away
by
the

we
must
not

that
the

itself
being

organ
requires

the
work
assigned
to
it
the
blood
which
is

the

from

known
as
the

minute

which
in
the

spread
themselves
around

the

having

now
laden

is
picked
up
by
minute
veinlets
which
unite
again
and
again

they
at

form
one
great

called

functions
of
the
liver
we
have
thus
far
studied
the
liver
only
as
an
organ
of
secretion
whose
work
is
to
elaborate
bile
for
future
use
in
the
process
of
digestion
this
is
however
only
one
of
its
functions
and
perhaps
not
the
most
important
in
fact
the
functions
of
the
liver
are
not
single
but
several
the
bile
is
not
wholly
a
digestive
fluid
but
it
contains
also
materials
which
are
separated
from
the
blood
to
be
cast
out
of
the
body
before
they
work
mischief
thus
the
liver
ranks
above
all
others
as
an
organ
of
excretion
that
is
it
separates
material
of
no
further
use
to
the
body
of
the
various
ingredients
of
the
bile
only
the
bile
salts
are
of
use
in
the
work
of
digestion
for
they
act
upon
the
fats
in
the
alimentary
canal
and
aid
somehow
in
their
emulsion
and
absorption
they
appear
to
be
themselves
split
up
into
other
substances
and
absorbed
with
the
dissolved
fats
into
the
blood
stream
again
the
third
function
of
the
liver
is
very
different
from
those
already
described
it
is
found
that
the
liver
of
an
animal
well
and
regularly
fed
when
examined
soon
after
death
contains
a
quantity
of
a
carbohydrate
substance
not
unlike
starch
this
substance
extracted
in
the
form
of
a
white
powder
is
really
an
animal
starch
it
is
called
glycogen
or
liver
sugar
and
is
easily
converted
into
grape
sugar
the
hepatic
cells
appear
to
manufacture
this
glycogen
and
to
store
it
up
from
the
food
brought
by
the
portal
blood
it
is
also
thought
the
glycogen
thus
deposited
and
stored
up
in
the
liver
is
little
by
little
changed
into
sugar
then
as
it
is
wanted
the
liver
disposes
of
this
material
by
pouring
it
in
a
state
of
solution
into
the
hepatic
vein
it
is
thus
steadily
carried
to
the
tissues
as
their
needs
demand
to
supply
them
with
material
to
be
transformed
into
heat
and
energy
the
pancreas
the
pancreas
or
sweetbread
is
much
smaller
than
the
liver
it
is
a
mass
from
six
to
eight
inches
long
weighing
from
three
to
four
ounces
and
is
often
compared
in
appearance
to
a
tongue
it
is
somewhat
the
shape
of
a
hammer
with
the
handle
running
to
a
point
the
pancreas
lies
behind
the
stomach
across
the
body
from
right
to
left
with
its
large
head
embraced
in
the
horseshoe
bend
of
the
duodenum
it
closely
resembles
the
salivary
glands
in
structure
with
its
main
duct
running
from
one
end
to
the
other
this
duct
at
last
enters
the
duodenum
in
company
with
the
common
bile
duct
the
pancreatic
juice
the
most
powerful
in
the
body
is
clear
somewhat
viscid
fluid
it
has
a
decided
alkaline
reaction
and
is
not
unlike
saliva
in
many
respects
combined
with
the
bile
this
juice
acts
upon
the
large
drops
of
fat
which
pass
from
the
stomach
into
the
duodenum
and
emulsifies
them
this
process
consists
partly
in
producing
a
fine
subdivision
of
the
particles
of
fat
called
an
emulsion
and
partly
in
a
chemical
decomposition
by
which
a
kind
of
soap
is
formed
in
this
way
the
oils
and
fats
are
divided
into
particles
sufficiently
minute
to
permit
of
their
being
absorbed
into
the
blood
again
this
most
important
digestive
fluid
produces
on
starch
an
action
similar
to
that
of
saliva
but
much
more
powerful
during
its
short
stay
in
the
mouth
very
little
starch
is
changed
into
sugar
and
in
the
stomach
as
we
have
seen
the
action
of
the
saliva
is
arrested
now
the
pancreatic
juice
takes
up
the
work
in
the
small
intestine
and
changes
the
greater
part
of
the
starch
into
sugar
nor
is
this
all
for
it
also
acts
powerfully
upon
the
proteids
not
acted
upon
in
the
stomach
and
changes
them
into
peptones
that
do
not
differ
materially
from
those
resulting
from
gastric
digestion
the
remarkable
power
which
the
pancreatic
juice
possesses
of
acting
on
all
the
appears
to
be
due
mainly
to
the
presence
of
a
specific
element

ferment

is
not
well
adapted
for
absorption
that
this
does
occur
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
certain
poisonous
chemicals
like
cyanide
of
potash
if
kept
in
the
mouth
for
a
few
moments
will
cause
death
while
we
are
chewing
and
swallowing
our
food
no
doubt
a
certain
amount
of
water
and
common
salt
together
with
sugar
which
has
been
changed
from
starch
by
the
action
of
the
saliva
gains
entrance
to
the
blood
in
the
stomach
however
absorption
takes
place
with
great
activity
the
food
is
separated
from
the
enormous
supply
of
in
the
mucous
membrane
only
by
a
thin
porous
partition
there
is
therefore
nothing
to
prevent
the
exchange
taking
place
between
the
blood
and
the
food
water
along
with
any
substances
in
the
food
that
have
become
dissolved
will
pass
through
the
partition
and
enter
the
thus
it
is
that
a
certain
amount
of
starch
that
has
been
changed
into
sugar
of
salts
in
solution
of
proteids
converted
into
peptones
is
taken
up
directly
by
the
of
the
stomach
absorption
by
the
intestines
absorption
by
the
intestines
is
a
most
active
and
complicated
process
the
stomach
is
really
an
organ
more
for
the
digestion
than
the
absorption
of
food
while
the
small
intestines
are
especially
constructed
for
absorption
in
fact
the
greatest
part
of
absorption
is
accomplished
by
the
small
intestines
they
have
not
only
a
very
large
area
of
absorbing
surface
but
also
structures
especially
adapted
to
do
this
work
the
lacteals
we
have
learned
in
section
that
the
mucous
lining
of
the
small
intestines
is
crowded
with
millions
of
little
appendages
called
villi
meaning
of
these
are
only
about
of
an
inch
long
and
a
dime
will
cover
more
than
five
hundred
of
them
each
villus
contains
a
loop
of
and
another
vessel
the
lacteal
so
called
from
the
latin
word
milk
because
of
the
milky
appearance
of
the
fluid
it
contains
the
villi
are
adapted
especially
for
the
absorption
of
fat
they
dip
like
the
tiniest
fingers
into
the
chyle
and
the
minute
particles
of
fat
pass
through
their
cellular
covering
and
gain
entrance
to
the
lacteals
the
milky
material
sucked
up
by
the
lacteals
is
not
in
a
proper
condition
to
be
poured
at
once
into
the
blood
current
it
is
as
it
were
in
too
crude
a
state
and
needs
some
special
preparation
the
intestines
are
suspended
to
the
posterior
wall
of
the
abdomen
by
a
double
fold
of
peritoneum
called
the
mesentery
in
this
membrane
are
some
glands
about
the
size
of
an
almond
called
mesenteric
glands
now
the
lacteals
join
these
glands
and
pour
in
their
fluid
contents
to
undergo
some
important
changes
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
mesenteric
glands
may
intercept
like
a
filter
material
which
if
allowed
to
enter
the
blood
would
disturb
the
whole
body
thus
while
the
glands
might
suffer
the
rest
of
the
body
might
escape
this
may
account
for
the
fact
that
these
glands
and
the
lymphatics
may
be
easily
irritated
and
inflamed
thus
becoming
enlarged
and
sensitive
as
often
occurs
in
the
axilla
having
been
acted
upon
by
the
mesenteric
glands
and
passed
through
them
the
chyle
flows
onward
until
it
is
poured
into
a
dilated
reservoir
for
the
chyle
known
as
the
receptaculum
chyli
this
is
a
expansion
of
the
lower
end
of
the
thoracic
duct
into
this
receptacle
situated
at
the
level
of
the
upper
lumbar
vertebræ
in
front
of
the
spinal
column
are
poured
not
only
the
contents
of
the
lacteals
but
also
of
the
lymphatic
vessels
of
the
lower
limbs
the
thoracic
duct
this
duct
is
a
tube
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
inches
long
which
passes
upwards
in
front
of
the
spine
to
reach
the
base
of
the
neck
where
it
opens
at
the
junction
of
the
great
veins
of
the
left
side
of
the
head
with
those
of
the
left
arm
thus
the
thoracic
duct
acts
as
a
kind
of
feeding
pipe
to
carry
along
the
nutritive
material
obtained
from
the
food
and
to
pour
it
into
the
blood
current
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
lacteals
are
in
reality
lymphatics

taking

to

under
the

in

complete

digestion
the
spleen
and
other
ductless
glands
with
the
lymphatics
may
be
classified
for
convenience
a
number
of
organs
called
ductless
or
blood
glands
although
they
apparently
prepare
materials
for
use
in
the
body
they
have
no
ducts
or
canals
along
which
may
be
carried
the
result
of
their
work
again
they
are
called
blood
glands
because
it
is
supposed
they
serve
some
purpose
in
preparing
material
for
the
blood
the
spleen
is
the
largest
of
these
glands
it
lies
beneath
the
diaphragm
and
upon
the
left
side
of
the
stomach
it
is
of
a
deep
red
color
full
of
blood
and
is
about
the
size
and
shape
of
the
palm
of
the
hand
the
spleen
has
a
fibrous
capsule
from
which
partitions
pass
inwards
dividing
it
into
spaces
by
a
framework
of
elastic
tissue
with
plain
muscular
fibers
these
spaces
are
filled
with
what
is
called
the
spleen
pulp
through
which
the
blood
filters
from
its
artery
just
as
a
fluid
would
pass
through
a
sponge
the
functions
of
the
spleen
are
not
known
it
appears
to
take
some
part
in
the
formation
of
blood
corpuscles
in
certain
diseases
like
malarial
fever
it
may
become
remarkably
enlarged
it
may
be
wholly
removed
from

animal
without

injury

it

to
act
as
a
muscular
pump
drawing
the
blood
onwards
with
increased
vigor
along
its
large
vein
to
the
liver
the
thyroid
is
another
ductless
gland
it
is
situated
beneath
the
muscles
of
the
neck
on
the
sides
of
and
below
it
it
undergoes
great
enlargement
in
the
disease
called

the
thymus
is
also
a
blood
gland
it
is
situated
around
the
windpipe
behind
the
upper
part
of
the
breastbone
until
about
the
end
of
the
second
year
it
increases
in
size
and
then
it
begins
gradually
to
shrivel
away
like
the
spleen
the
thyroid
and
thymus
glands
are
supposed
to
work
some
change
in
the
blood
but
what
is
not
clearly
known
the
suprarenal
capsules
are
two
little
bodies
one
perched
on
the
top
of
each
kidney
in

depends
partly
upon
the
nature
of
the
food
in
its
raw
state
partly
upon
the
effect
produced
upon
it
by
cooking
and
to
some
extent
upon
its
admixture
with
other
foods
certain
foods
as
the
vegetable
albumens
are
both
nutritious
and
digestible
a
man
may
grow
strong
and
maintain
vigorous
health
on
most
of
them
even
if
deprived
of
animal
food
while
it
is
true
that
the
vegetable
albumens
furnish
all
that
is
really
needed
for
the
bodily
health
animal
food
of
some
kind
is
an
economical
and
useful
addition
to
the
diet
races
of
men
who
endure
prolonged
physical
exertion
have
discovered
for
themselves
without
the
teaching
of
science
the
great
value
of
meat
hence
the
common
custom
of
eating
meat
with
bread
and
vegetables
is
a
sound
one
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
the
people
of
this
country
as
a
rule
eat
meat
too
often
and
too
much
at
a
time
the
judicious
admixture
of
different
classes
of
foods
greatly
aids
their
digestibility
the
great
abundance
and
variety
of
food
in
this
country
permit
this
principle
to
be
put
into
practice
a
variety
of
mixed
foods
as
milk
eggs
bread
and
meat
are
almost
invariably
associated
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
at
every
meal
oftentimes
where
there
is
of
necessity
a
sameness
of
diet
there
arises
a
craving
for
special
articles
of
food
thus
on
long
voyages
and
during
long
campaigns
in
war
there
is
an
almost
universal
craving
for
onions
raw
potatoes
and
other
vegetables
hints
about
meals
on
an
average
three
meals
each
day
from
five
to
six
hours
apart
is
the
proper
number
for
adults
five
hours
is
by
no
means
too
long
a
time
to
intervene
between
consecutive
meals
for
it
is
not
desirable
to
introduce
new
food
into
the
stomach
until
the
gastric
digestion
of
the
preceding
meal
has
been
completed
and
until
the
stomach
has
had
time
to
rest
and
is
in
condition
to
receive
fresh
material
the
stomach
like
other
organs
does
its
work
best
at
regular
periods
eating
out
of
mealtimes
should
be
strictly
avoided
for
it
robs
the
stomach
of
its
needed
rest
food
eaten
when
the
body
and
mind
are
wearied
is
not
well
digested
rest
even
for
a
few
minutes
should
be
taken
before
eating
a
full
meal
it
is
well
to
lie
down
or
sit
quietly
and
read
fifteen
minutes
before
eating
and
directly
afterwards
if
possible
severe
exercise
and
hard
study
just
after
a
full
meal
are
very
apt
to
delay
or
actually
arrest
digestion
for
after
eating
heartily
the
vital
forces
of
the
body
are
called
upon
to
help
the
stomach
digest
its
food
if
our
bodily
energies
are
compelled
in
addition
to
this
to
help
the
muscles
or
brain
digestion
is
retarded
and
a
feeling
of
dullness
and
heaviness
follows
fermentative
changes
instead
of
the
normal
digestive
changes
are
apt
to
take
place
in
the
food
practical
points
about
eating
we
should
not
eat
for
at
least
two
or
three
hours
before
going
to
bed
when
we
are
asleep
the
vital
forces
are
at
a
low
ebb
the
process
of
digestion
is
for
the
time
nearly
suspended
and
the
retention
of
incompletely
digested
food
in
the
stomach
may
cause
bad
dreams
and
troubled
sleep
but
in
many
cases
of
sleeplessness
a
trifle
of
some
simple
food
especially
if
the
stomach
seems
to
feel
exhausted
often
appears
to
promote
sleep
and
rest

the

has
much
to
do
with

sudden

news
may
destroy
the
appetite
at
once
let
a
hungry
person
be
anxiously
awaiting
a
hearty
meal
when
suddenly
a
disastrous
telegram
is
brought
him
all
appetite
instantly
disappears
and
the
tempting
food
is
refused
hence
we
should
laugh
and
talk
at
our
meals
and
drive
away
anxious
thoughts
and
unpleasant
topics
of
discussion
the
proper
chewing
of
the
food
is
an
important
element
in
digestion
hence
eat
slowly
and
do
not
large
fragments
of
food
if
imperfectly
chewed
it
is
not
readily
acted
upon
by
the
gastric
juice
and
often
undergoes
fermentative
changes
which
result
in
sour
stomach
gastric
pain
and
other
digestive
disturbance
if
we
take
too
much
drink
with
our
meals
the
flow
of
the
saliva
is
checked
and
digestion
is
hindered
it
is
not
desireable
to
dilute
the

nor
to
chill
the

with
large
amount
of
cold
liquid
do
not
take
food
and
drink
too

or
too
cold
if
they
are
taken
too
cold
the
stomach
is
chilled
and
digestion
delayed
if
we
drink
freely
of
it
may
require
half
an
hour
or
more
for
the
stomach
to
regain
its
natural
heat
it
is
a
poor
plan
to
stimulate
a
flagging
appetite
with
highly
spiced
food
and
bitter
drinks
an
undue
amount
of
pepper
mustard
horseradish
pickles
and
highly
seasoned
may
stimulate
digestion
for
the
time
but
they
soon
impair
it
note
the
process
of
gastric
digestion
was
studied
many
years
ago
by
beaumont
and
others
in
the
remarkable
case
of
alexis
martin
a
who
met
with
a
wound
which
left
a
permanent
opening
into
his
stomach
guarded
by
a
little
valve
of
mucous
membrane
through
this
opening
the
lining
of
the
stomach
could
be
seen
the
temperature
ascertained
and
numerous
experiments
made
as
to
the
digestibility
of
various
kinds
of
food
it
was
by
these
careful
and
convincing
experiments
that
the
foundation
of
our
exact
knowledge
of
the
composition
and
action
of
gastric
juice
was
laid
the
modest
book
in
which
beaumont
published
his
results
is
still
counted
among
the
classics
of
physiology
the
production
of
artificial
fistulæ
in
animals
a
method
that
has
since
proved
so
fruitful
was
first
suggested
by
his
work
it
can
not
be
too
strongly
stated
that
food
of
a
simple
character
well
cooked
and
neatly
served
is
more
productive
of
healthful
living
than
a
great
variety
of
fancy
dishes
which
unduly
stimulate
the
digestive
organs
and
create
a
craving
for
food
in
excess
of
the
bodily
needs
the
proper
care
of
the
teeth
it
is
our
duty
not
only
to
take
the
very
best
care
of
our
teeth
but
to
retain
them
as
long
as
possible
teeth
as
we
well
know
are
prone
to
decay
we
may
inherit
poor
and
soft
teeth
our
mode
of
living
may
make
bad
teeth
worse
if
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
ever
worth
a
pound
of
cure
it
is
in
keeping
the
teeth
in
good
order
bad
teeth
and
toothless
gums
mean
imperfect
chewing
of
the
food
and
hence
impaired
digestion
to
attain
a
healthful
old
age
the
power
of
vigorous
mastication
must
be
preserved
one
of
the
most
frequent
causes
of
decay
of
the
teeth
is
the
retention
of
fragments
of
food
between
and
around
them
the
warmth
and
moisture
of
the
mouth
make
these
matters
decompose
quickly
the
acid
thus
generated
attacks
the
enamel
of
the
teeth
causing
decay
of
the
dentine
decayed
teeth
are
often
the
cause
of
an
offensive
breath
and
a
foul
stomach
illustration
fig
on
the
inside
of
the
right
hand
to
keep
the
teeth
clean
and
wholesome
they
should
be
thoroughly
cleansed
at
bedtime
and
in
the
morning
with
a
soft
brush
and
warm
water
castile
soap
and
some
prepared
without
grit
should
be
used
and
the
brush
should
be
applied
on
both
sides
of
the
teeth
the
enamel
once
broken
through
is
never
renewed
the
tooth
decays
slowly
but
surely
hence
we
must
guard
against
certain
habits
which
injure
the
enamel
as
picking
the
teeth
with
pins
and
needles
we
should
never
crack
nuts
crush
hard
candy
or
bite
off
stout
thread
with
the
teeth
stiff
gritty
and
cheap
and
hot
food
and
drink
often
injure
the
enamel
to
remove
fragments
of
food
which
have
lodged
between
adjacent
teeth
a
quill
or
wooden
toothpick
should
be
used
even
better
than
these
is
the
use
of
floss
or
silk
which
when
drawn
between
the
teeth
effectually
dislodges
retained
particles
if
the
teeth
are
not
regularly
cleansed
they
become
discolored
and
a
hard
coating
known
as
accumulates
on
them
and
tends
to
loosen
them
it
is
said
that
after
the
age
of
thirty
more
teeth
are
lost
from
this
deposit
than
from
all
other
causes
combined
in
fact
decay
and
tartar
are
the
two
great
agents
that
furnish
work
for
the
dentist
hints
about
saving
teeth
we
should
exercise
the
greatest
care
in
saving
the
teeth
the
last
resort
of
all
is
to
lose
a
tooth
by
extraction
the
skilled
dentist
will
save
almost
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
tooth
people
are
often
urged
and
consent
to
have
a
number
of
teeth
extracted
which
with
but
little
trouble
and
expense
might
be
kept
and
do
good
service
for
years
the
object
is
to
replace
the
teeth
with
an
artificial
set
very
few
plates
either
partial
or
entire
are
worn
with
real
comfort
they
should
always
be
removed
before
going
to
sleep
as
there
is
danger
of
their
being
swallowed
the
great
majority
of
drugs
have
no
injurious
effect
upon
the
teeth
some
medicines
however
must
be
used
with
great
care
the
acids
used
in
the
tincture
of
iron
have
a
great
affinity
for
the
lime
salts
of
the
teeth
as
this
form
of
iron
is
often
used
it
is
not
unusual
to
see
teeth
very
badly
stained
or
decayed
from
the
effects
of
this
drug
the
acid
used
in
the
liquid
preparations
of
quinine
may
destroy
the
teeth
in
a
comparatively
short
time
after
taking
such
medicines
the
mouth
should
be
thoroughly
rinsed
with
a
weak
solution
of
common
soda
and
the
teeth
cleansed
alcohol
and
digestion
the
influence
of
alcoholic
drinks
upon
digestion
is
of
the
utmost
importance
alcohol
is
not
and
can
not
be
regarded
from
a
physiological
point
of
view
as
a
true
food
the
reception
given
to
it
by
the
stomach
proves
this
very
plainly
it
is
obviously
an
unwelcome
intruder
it
can
not
like
proper
foods
be
transformed
into
any
element
or
component
of
the
human
body
but
passes
on
innutritious
and
for
the
most
part
unappropriated
taken
even
into
the
mouth
by
any
person
not
hardened
to
its
use
its
effect
is
so
pungent
and
burning
as
at
once
to
demand
its
rejection
but
if
allowed
to
pass
into
the
stomach
that
organ
immediately
rebels
against
its
intrusion
and
not
unfrequently
ejects
it
with
indignant
emphasis
the
burning
sensation
it
produces
there
is
only
an
appeal
for
water
to
dilute
it
the
stomach
meanwhile
in
response
to
this
fiery
invitation
secretes
from
its
myriad
pores
its
juices
and
watery
fluids
to
protect
itself
as
much
as
possible
from
the
invading
liquid
it
does
not
digest
alcoholic
drinks
we
might
say
it
does
not
attempt
to
because
they
are
not
material
suitable
for
digestion
and
also
because
no
organ
can
perform
its
normal
work
while
smarting
under
an
unnatural
irritation
even
if
the
stomach
does
not
at
once
eject
the
poison
it
refuses
to
adopt
it
as
food
for
it
does
not
pass
along
with
the
other
food
material
as
chyme
into
the
intestines
but
is
seized
by
the
absorbents
borne
into
the
veins
which
convey
it
to
the
heart
whence
the
pulmonary
artery
conveys
it
to
the
lungs
where
its
presence
is
announced
in
the
breath
but
wherever
alcohol
is
carried
in
the
tissues
it
is
always
an
irritant
every
organ
in
turn
endeavoring
to
rid
itself
of
the
noxious
material
effect
of
alcoholic
liquor
upon
the
stomach
the
methods
by
which
intoxicating
drinks
impair
and
often
ruin
digestion
are
various
we
know
that
a
piece
of
animal
food
as
beef
if
soaked
in
alcohol
for
a
few
hours
becomes
hard
and
tough
the
fibers
having
been
compacted
together
because
of
the
abstraction
of
their
moisture
by
the
alcohol
which
has
a
marvelous
affinity
for
water
in
the
same
way
alcohol
hardens
and
toughens
animal
food
in
the
stomach
condensing
its
fibers
and
rendering
it
indigestible
thus
preventing
the
healthful
nutrition
of
the
body
so
if
alcohol
be
added
to
the
clear
liquid
white
of
an
egg
it
is
instantly
coagulated
and
transformed
into
hard
albumen
as
a
result
of
this
hardening
action
animal
food
in
contact
with
alcoholic
liquids
in
the
stomach
remains
undigested
and
must
either
be
detained
there
so
long
as
to
become
a
source
of
gastric
disturbance
or
else
be
allowed
to
pass
undigested
through
the
pyloric
gate
and
then
may
become
a
cause
of
serious
intestinal
disturbance
this
peculiar
property
of
alcohol
its
greedy
absorption
of
water
from
objects
in
contact
with
it
acts
also
by
absorbing
liquids
from
the
surface
of
the
stomach
itself
thus
hardening
the
delicate
glands
impairing
their
ability
to
absorb
the
and
so
inducing
gastric
dyspepsia
this
local
injury
inflicted
upon
the
stomach
by
all
forms
of
intoxicants
is
serious
and
protracted
this
organ
is
with
admirable
wisdom
so
constructed
as
to
endure
a
surprising
amount
of
abuse
but
it
was
plainly
not
intended
to
thrive
on
alcoholic
liquids
the
application
of
fiery
drinks
to
its
tender
surface
produces
at
first
a
marked
congestion
of
its
changing
the
natural
pink
color
as
in
the
mouth
to
a
bright
or
deep
red
if
the
irritation
be
not
repeated
the
lining
membrane
soon
recovers
its
natural
appearance
but
if
repeated
and
continued
the
congestion
becomes
more
intense
the
red
color
deeper
and
darker
the
entire
surface
is
the
subject
of
chronic
inflammation
its
walls
are
thickened
and
sometimes
ulcerated
in
this
deplorable
state
the
organ
is
quite
unable
to
perform
its
normal
work
of
digestion
alcohol
and
the
gastric
juice
but
still
another
destructive
influence
upon
digestion
appears
in
the
singular
fact
that
alcohol
diminishes
the
power
of
the
gastric
juice
to
do
its
proper
work
alcohol
coagulates
the
pepsin
which
is
the
dissolving
element
in
this
important
gastric
fluid
a
very
simple
experiment
will
prove
this
obtain
a
small
quantity
of
gastric
juice
from
the
fresh
stomach
of
a
calf
or
pig
by
gently
pressing
it
in
a
very
little
water
pour
the
milky
juice
into
a
clear
glass
vessel
add
a
little
alcohol
and
a
white
deposit
will
presently
settle
to
the
bottom
this
deposit
contains
the
pepsin
of
the
gastric
juice
the
potent
element
by
which
it
does
its
special
work
of
digestion
the
ill
effect
of
alcohol
upon
it
is
one
of
the
prime
factors
in
the
long
series
of
evil
results
from
the
use
of
intoxicants
the
final
results
upon
digestion
we
have
thus
explained
three
different
methods
by
which
alcoholic
drinks
exercise
a
terrible
power
for
harm
they
act
upon
the
food
so
as
to
render
it
less
digestible
they
injure
the
stomach
so
as
seriously
to
impair
its
power
of
digestion
and
they
deprive
the
gastric
juice
of
the
one
principal
ingredient
essential
to
its
usefulness
alcoholic
drinks
forced
upon
the
stomach
are
a
foreign
substance
the
stomach
treats
them
as
such
and
refuses
to
go
on
with
the
process
of
digestion
till
it
first
gets
rid
of
the
poison
this
irritating
presence
and
delay
weaken
the
stomach
so
that
when
proper
food
follows
the
enfeebled
organ
is
ill
prepared
for
its
work
after
intoxication
there
occurs
an
obvious
reaction
of
the
stomach
and
digestive
organs
against
the
violent
and
unnatural
disturbance
the
appetite
is
extinguished
or
depraved
and
intense
headache
racks
the
frame
the
whole
system
is
prostrated
as
from
a
partial
paralysis
all
these
results
being
the
voice
of
sharp
warning
of
this
great
wrong
and
a
rest
of
some
days
is
needed
before
the
system
fully
recovers
from
the
injury
inflicted
it
is
altogether
an
error
to
suppose
the
use
of
intoxicants
is
necessary
or
even
desirable
to
promote
appetite
or
digestion
in
health
good
food
and
a
stomach
undisturbed
by
artificial
interference
furnish
all
the
conditions
required
more
than
these
is
harmful
if
it
may
sometimes
seem
as
if
alcoholic
drinks
arouse
the
appetite
and
invigorate
digestion
we
must
not
shut
our
eyes
to
the
fact
that
this
is
only
a
seeming
and
that
their
continued
use
will
inevitably
ruin
both
in
brief
there
is
no
more
sure
foe
to
good
appetite
and
normal
digestion
than
the
habitual
use
of
alcoholic
liquors
effect
of
alcoholic
drinks
upon
the
liver
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
circulation
of
the
liver
is
peculiar
that
the
capillaries
of
the
hepatic
artery
unite
in
the
lobule
with
those
of
the
portal
vein
and
thus
the
blood
from
both
sources
is
combined
and
that
the
portal
vein
brings
to
the
liver
the
blood
from
the
stomach
the
intestines
and
the
spleen
from
the
fact
that
alcohol
absorbed
from
the
stomach
enters
the
portal
vein
and
is
borne
directly
to
the
liver
we
would
expect
to
find
this
organ
suffering
the
full
effects
of
its
presence
and
all
the
more
would
this
be
true
because
we
have
just
learned
that
the
liver
acts
as
a
sort
of
filter
to
strain
from
the
blood
its
impurities
so
the
liver
is
especially
liable
to
diseases
produced
by
alcoholics
post
mortems
of
those
who
have
died
while
intoxicated
show
a
larger
amount
of
alcohol
in
the
liver
than
in
any
other
organ
next
to
the
stomach
the
liver
is
an
early
and
late
sufferer
and
this
is
especially
the
case
with
hard
drinkers
and
even
more
moderate
drinkers
in
hot
climates
yellow
fever
occurring
in
inebriates
is
always
fatal
the
effects
produced
in
the
liver
are
not
so
much
functional
as
organic
that
is
not
merely
a
disturbed
mode
of
action
but
a
destruction
of
the
fabric
of
the
organ
itself
from
the
use
of
intoxicants
the
liver
becomes
at
first
irritated
then
inflamed
and
finally
seriously
diseased
the
fine
bands
or
septa
which
serve
as
partitions
between
the
hepatic
lobules
and
so
maintain
the
form
and
consistency
of
the
organ
are
the
special
subjects
of
the
inflammation
though
the
liver
is
at
first
enlarged
it
soon
becomes
contracted
the
secreting
cells
are
compressed
and
are
quite
unable
to
perform
their
proper
work
which
indeed
is
a
very
important
one
in
the
round
of
the
digestion
of
food
and
the
purification
of
the
blood
this
contraction
of
the
septa
in
time
gives
the
whole
organ
an
irregularly
puckered
appearance
called
from
this
fact
a
liver
or
popularly
gin
liver
the
yellowish
discoloration
usually
from
retained
or
perverted
bile
gives
the
disease
the
medical
name
of
cirrhosis
it
is
usually
accompanied
with
dropsy
in
the
lower
extremities
caused
by
obstruction
to
the
return
of
the
circulation
from
the
parts
below
the
liver
this
disease
is
always
fatal
fatty
degeneration
due
to
alcohol
another
form
of
destructive
disease
often
occurs
there
is
an
increase
of
fat
globules
deposited
in
the
liver
causing
notable
enlargement
and
destroying
its
function
this
is
called
fatty
degeneration
and
is
not
limited
to
the
liver
but
other
organs
are
likely
to
be
similarly
affected
in
truth
this
deposition
of
fat
is
a
most
significant
occurrence
as
it
means
actual
destruction
of
the
liver
tissues
less
than
progressive
death
of
the
organ
this
condition
always
leads
to
a
fatal
issue
still
other
forms
of
alcoholic
disease
of
the
liver
are
produced
one
being
the
excessive
formation
of
sugar
constituting
what
is
known
as
a
form
of
diabetes
effect
of
tobacco
on
digestion
the
noxious
influence
of
tobacco
upon
the
process
of
digestion
is
nearly
parallel
to
the
effects
of
alcohol
which
it
resembles
in
its
irritant
and
narcotic
character
locally
it
stimulates
the
secretion
of
saliva
to
an
unnatural
extent
and
this
excess
of
secretion
diminishes
the
amount
available
for
normal
digestion
tobacco
also
poisons
the
saliva
furnished
for
the
digestion
of
food
and
thus
at
the
very
outset
impairs
in
both
of
these
particulars
the
general
digestion
and
especially
the
digestion
of
the
starchy
portions
of
the
food
for
this
reason
the
amount
of
food
taken
fails
to
nourish
as
it
should
and
either
more
food
must
be
taken
or
the
body
becomes
gradually
impoverished
the
poisonous
the
active
element
of
tobacco
exerts
a
destructive
influence
upon
the
stomach
digestion
enfeebling
the
vigor
of
the
muscular
walls
of
that
organ
these
effects
combined
produce
dyspepsia
with
its
weary
train
of
baneful
results
the
tobacco
tongue
never
presents
the
natural
clear
pink
color
but
rather
a
dirty
yellow
and
is
usually
heavily
coated
showing
a
disordered
stomach
and
impaired
digestion
then
too
there
is
dryness
of
the
mouth
an
unnatural
thirst
that
demands
drink
but
pure
water
is
stale
and
flat
to
such
a
mouth
something
more
emphatic
is
needed
thus
comes
the
unnatural
craving
for
alcoholic
liquors
and
thus
are
taken
the
first
steps
on
the
downward
grade
is
no
doubt
that
tobacco
predisposes
to
neuralgia
vertigo
indigestion
and
other
affections

the
blood

its
circulation
the
circulation
all
the
tissues
of
the
body
are
traversed
by
exceedingly
minute
tubes
called
capillaries
which
receive
the
blood
from
the
arteries
and
convey
it
to
the

these
capillaries
form
a
great
system
of

the

of
which
are
filled
with
the
elements
of
the
various

that
is
the
capillaries

lie

the

and

the

of

in
which
a
transfer
of
material
takes
place
between
the

in
the

around

a
similar

is
constantly
going

we
must
remember
in

so

lasts
this

takes
place
between
the

the
body
was
formerly
greatly
overestimated
it
is
about
of
the
total
weight
of
the
body
and
in
a
person
weighing
pounds
would
amount
to
about
pounds
blood
corpuscles
if
we
put
a
drop
of
blood
upon
a
glass
slide
and
place
upon
it
a
cover
of
thin
glass
we
can
flatten
it
out
until
the
color
almost
disappears
if
we
examine
this
thin
film
with
a
microscope
we
see
that
the
blood
is
not
altogether
fluid
we
find
that
the
liquid
part
or
plasma
is
of
a
light
straw
color
and
has
floating
in
it
a
multitude
of
very
minute
bodies
called
corpuscles
these
are
of
two
kinds
the
red
and
the
colorless
the
former
are
much
more
numerous
and
have
been
compared
somewhat
fancifully
to
countless
myriads
of
tiny
fishes
in
a
swiftly
flowing
stream
red
corpuscles
the
red
corpuscles
are
circular
disks
about
of
an
inch
in
diameter
and
double
concave
in
shape
they
tend
to
adhere
in
long
rolls
like
piles
of
coins
they
are
soft
flexible
and
elastic
readily
squeezing
through
openings
and
passages
narrower
than
their
own
diameter
then
at
once
resuming
their
own
shape
the
red
corpuscles
are
so
very
small
that
rather
more
than
ten
millions
of
them
will
lie
on
a
surface
one
inch
square
their
number
is
so
enormous
that
if
all
the
red
corpuscles
in
a
healthy
person
could
be
arranged
in
a
continuous
line
it
is
estimated
that
they
would
reach
four
times
around
the
earth
the
principal
constituent
of
these
corpuscles
next
to
water
and
that
which
gives
them
color
is
a
compound
containing
iron
as
all
the
tissues
are
constantly
absorbing
oxygen
and
giving
off
carbon
dioxid
a
very
important
office
of
the
red
corpuscles
is
to
carry
oxygen
to
all
parts
of
the
body
colorless
corpuscles
the
colorless
corpuscles
are
larger
than
the
red
their
average
diameter
being
about
of
an
inch
while
the
red
corpuscles
are
regular
in
shape
and
float
about
and
tumble
freely
over
one
another
the
colorless
are
of
irregular
shape
and
stick
close
to
the
glass
slide
on
which
they
are
placed
again
while
the
red
corpuscles
are
changed
only
by
some
influence
from
without
as
pressure
and
the
like
the
colorless
corpuscles
spontaneously
undergo
active
and
very
curious
changes
of
form
resembling
those
of
the
amœba
a
very
minute
organism
found
in
stagnant
water
fig
the
number
of
both
red
and
colorless
corpuscles
varies
a
great
deal
from
time
to
time
for
instance
the
number
of
the
latter
increases
after
meals
and
quickly
diminishes
there
is
reason
to
think
both
kinds
of
corpuscles
are
continually
being
destroyed
their
place
being
supplied
by
new
ones
while
the
action
of
the
colorless
corpuscles
is
important
to
the
lymph
and
the
chyle
and
in
the
coagulation
of
the
blood
their
real
function
has
not
been
ascertained

a

powerful

is
necessary
to
examine
blood
corpuscles
let
a
small
drop
of
blood
easily
obtained
by
pricking
the
finger
with
a
needle
be
placed
upon
a
clean
slip
of
glass
and
covered
with
thin
glass
such
as
is
ordinarily
used
for
microscopic
purposes
the
blood
is
thus
spread
out
into
a
film
and
may
be
readily
examined
at
first
the
red
corpuscles
will
be
seen
as
pale
bodies
floating
in
the
clear
fluid
soon
they
will
be
observed
to
stick
to
each
other
by
their
flattened
faces
so
as
to
form
rows
the
colorless
corpuscles
are
to
be
seen
among
the
red
ones
but
are
much
less
numerous
the
coagulation
of
the
blood
blood
when
shed
from
the
living
body
is
as
fluid
as
water
but
it
soon
becomes
viscid
and
flows
less
readily
from
one
vessel
to
another
soon
the
whole
mass
becomes
a
nearly
solid
jelly
called
a
clot
the
vessel
containing
it
even
can
be
turned
upside
down
without
a
drop
of
blood
being
spilled
if
carefully
shaken
out
the
mass
will
form
a

of
the
vessel
in
which
it
is
contained
and
is
of
a
uniform
color
but
in
a
short
time
a
pale
yellowish
fluid
begins
to
ooze
out
and
to
collect
on
the
surface
the
clot
gradually
shrinks
until
at
the
end
of
a
few
hours
it
is
much
firmer
and
floats
in
the
yellowish
fluid
the
white
corpuscles
become
entangled
in
the
upper
portion
of
clot
giving
it
a
pale
yellow
look
on
the
top
known
as
the
as
the
clot
is
attached
to
the
sides
of
the
vessel
the
shrinkage
is
more
pronounced
toward
the
center
and
thus
the
surface
of
the
clot
is
hollowed
or
as
it
is
called
this
remarkable
process
is
known
as
coagulation
or
the
clotting
of
blood
and
the
liquid
which
separates
from
the
clot
is
called
serum
the
serum
is
almost
entirely
free
from
corpuscles
these
being
entangled

d
lower
portion

this
clotting
of
the
blood
is
due
to
the
formation
in
the
blood
after
it
is
withdrawn
from
the
living
body
of
a
substance
called
fibrin
it
is
made
up
of
a
network
of
fine
white
threads
running
in
every
direction
through
the
plasma
and
is
a
proteid
substance
the
coagulation
of
the
blood
may
be
retarded
and
even
prevented
by
a
temperature
below
or
a
temperature
above
the
addition
of
common
salt
also
prevents
coagulation
the
clotting
of
the
blood
may
be
hastened
by
free
access
to
air
by
contact
with
roughened
surfaces
or
by
keeping
it
at
perfect
rest
this
power
of
coagulation
is
of
the
most
vital
importance
but
for
this
a
very
small
cut
might
cause
bleeding
sufficient
to
empty
the
and
death
would
speedily
follow
in
slight
cuts
nature
plugs
up
the
wound
with
clots
of
blood
and
thus
prevents
excessive
bleeding
the
unfavorable
effects
of
the
want
of
clotting
are
illustrated
in
some
persons
in
whom
bleeding
from
even
the
slightest
wounds
continues
till
life
is

such
persons
are

to

but
also
to

we

the

and
again
until
it
ends
in
capillaries
which
form
a
very
fine
network
in
every
part
of
the
lung
thus
the
blood
is
pumped
from
the
right
ventricle
into
the
pulmonary
artery
and
distributed
throughout
the
two
lungs
figs
and
we
will
now
turn
to
the
left
side
of
the
heart
and
notice
the
general
arrangement
of
its
great
vessels
four
veins
called
the
pulmonary
veins
open
into
the
left
auricle
two
from
each
lung
these
veins
start
from
very
minute
vessels
the
continuation
of
the
capillaries
of
the
pulmonary
artery
they
form
larger
and
larger
vessels
until
they
become
two
large
veins
in
each
lung
and
pour
their
contents
into
the
left
auricle
thus
the
pulmonary
artery
carries
venous
blood
from
the
right
ventricle
the
lungs
as
the
pulmonary
veins
carry
arterial
blood
the
lungs
to
the
left
auricle
from
the
left
ventricle
springs
the
largest
arterial
trunk
in
the
body
over
of
an
inch
in
diameter
called
the
aorta
from
the
aorta
other
arteries
branch
off
to
carry
the
blood
to
all
parts
of
the
body
only
to
be
again
brought
back
by
the
veins
to
the
right
side
through
the
cavities
of
the
ventricles
we
shall
learn
in
chapter
viii
that
the
main
object
of
pumping
the
blood
into
the
lungs
is
to
have
it
purified
from
certain
waste
matters
which
it
has
taken
up
in
its
course
through
the
body
before
it
is
again
sent
on
its
journey
from
the
left
ventricle
the
arteries
the
are
flexible
tubes
through
which
the
blood
is
borne
through
the
body
there
are
three
kinds
arteries
the
veins
and
the
capillaries
and
these
differ
from
one
another
in
various
ways
the
arteries
are
the
highly
elastic
and
extensible
tubes
which
carry
the
pure
fresh
blood
outwards
from
the
heart
to
all
parts
of
the
body
they
may
all
be
regarded
as
branches
of
the
aorta
after
the
aorta
leaves
the
left
ventricle
it
rises
towards
the
neck
but
soon
turns
downwards
making
a
curve
known
as
the
arch
of
the
aorta
from
the
arch
are
given
off
the
arteries
which
supply
the
head
and
arms
with
blood
these
are
the
two
carotid
arteries
which
run
up
on
each
side
of
the
neck
to
the
head
and
the
two
subclavian
arteries
which
pass
beneath
the
collar
bone
to
the
arms
this
great
arterial
trunk
now
passes
down
in
front
of
the
spine
to
the
pelvis
where
it
divides
into
two
main
branches
which
supply
the
pelvis
and
the
lower
limbs
the
descending
aorta
while
passing
downwards
gives
off
arteries
to
the
different
tissues
and
organs
of
these
branches
the
chief
are
the
cœliac
artery
which
subdivides
into
three
great
branches
each
to
supply
the
stomach
the
liver
and
the
spleen
then
the
renal
arteries
one
to
each
kidney
and
next
two
others
the
mesenteric
arteries
to
the
intestines
the
aorta
at
last
divides
into
two
main
branches
the
common
iliac
arteries
which
by
their
subdivisions
furnish
the
arterial
vessels
for
the
pelvis
and
the
lower

the

the
veins
are
the
which
carry
the
impure
blood
from
the
various
tissues
of
the
body
to
the
heart
they
begin
in
the
minute
capillaries
at
the
extremities
of
the
four
limbs
and
everywhere
throughout
the

and
passing
onwards
toward
the

receive
constantly
fresh
accessions
on

myriad
other

bringing

till
the
central
veins
gradually
unite

larger
vessels
until
at

they
form
the

open

generally

most
veins
lie
near

beneath
the
skin
they
may
be
easily
seen
under

of
the

arm
of
a

is
allowed
to
hang
down
a
few
moments
and
then
tightly
bandaged
above
the
elbow
to
retard
the
return
of
the

the
veins
become
large
and
prominent
the
walls
of
the
larger
veins
unlike
arteries
contain
but
little
of
either
elastic
or
muscular
tissue
hence
they
are
thin
and
when
empty
collapse
the
inner
surfaces
of
many
of
the
veins
are
supplied
with
folds
or
pockets
which
act
as
valves
to
impede
the
backward
flow
of
the
blood
while
they
do
not
obstruct
blood
flowing
forward
toward
the

these
valves
can
be
shown
by
letting
the
forearm
hang

sliding
the
finger
upwards
over
the
veins
fig
the
veins
have
no
like
the
arteries
to
propel
their
contents
towards
their
destination
the
onward
flow
of
the
blood
in
them
is
due
to
various
causes
the
chief
being
the
pressure
behind
of
the
blood
pumped
into
the
capillaries
then
as
the
valves
prevent
the
backward
flow
of
the
blood
the
pressure
of
the
various
muscles
of
the
body
urges
along
the
blood
and
thus
promotes
the
onward
flow
the
forces
which
drive
the
blood
through
the
arteries
are
sufficient
to
carry
the
blood
on
through
the
capillaries
it
is
calculated
that
the
onward
flow
in
the
capillaries
is
about
to
of
an
inch
in
a
second
while
in
the
arteries
the
blood
current
flows
about

about

the

are
the
minute
tubes
with
very
thin
walls
which
form
the
connection
between
the
ending
of
the
finest
arteries
and
the
beginning
of
the
smallest

they
are
distributed
through

the

so
minute
as
to
be
quite
invisible
at

smaller
than
the

visible

the
capillaries
serve
as
a
medium
to
transmit
the
blood
from
the
arteries
to
the
veins
and
it
is
through
them
that
the
blood
brings
nourishment
to
the
surrounding
tissues
in
brief
we
may
regard
the
whole
body
as
consisting
of
countless
groups
of
little
islands
surrounded
by
streams
of
blood
the
walls
of
the
capillaries
are
of
the
most
delicate
structure
consisting
of
a
single
layer
of
cells
loosely
connected
thus
there
is
allowed
the
most
free
interchange
between
the
blood
and
the
tissues
through
the
medium
of
the
lymph
the
number
of
the
capillaries
is
inconceivable
those
in

alone
placed
in

would
reach
thousands

are
admirably
adapted
for
the
important
interchanges
that
take
place
between
the
blood
and
the
tissues
the
circulation
of
the
blood
it
is
now
well
to
study
the
circulation
as
a
whole
tracing
the
course
of
the
blood
from
a
certain
point
until
it
returns
to
the
same
point
we
may
conveniently
begin
with
the
portion
of
blood
contained
at
any
moment
in
the
right
auricle
the
superior
and
inferior
venæ
cavæ
are
busily
filling

with
dark

blood
when
it
is
full
it
contracts
the
passage
leading
to
the
right
ventricle
lies
open
and
through
it
the
blood
pours
till
the
ventricle
is
full
instantly
this
begins
in
its
turn
to
contract
the
tricuspid
valve
at
once
closes
and
blocks
the
way
backward
the
blood
is
now
forced
through
the
open
semilunar
valves
into
the
pulmonary
artery
the
pulmonary
artery
bringing
venous
blood
by
its
alternate
expansion
and
recoil
draws
the
blood
along
until
it
reaches
the
pulmonary
capillaries
these
tiny
tubes
surround
the
air
cells
of
the
lungs
and
here
an
exchange
takes
place
the
impure
venous
blood
here
gives
up
its
in
the
shape
of
carbon
dioxid
and
water
and
in
return
takes
up
a
large
amount
of
oxygen
thus
the
blood
brought
to
the
lungs
by
the
pulmonary
arteries
leaves
the
lungs
entirely
different
in
character
and
appearance
this
part
of
the
circulation
is
often
called
the
lesser
or
pulmonic
circulation
the
four
pulmonary
veins
bring
back
bright
scarlet
blood
and
pour
it
into
the
left
auricle
of
the
heart
whence
it
passes
through
the
mitral
valve
into
the
left
ventricle
as
soon
as
the
left
ventricle
is
full
it
contracts
the
mitral
valve
instantly
closes
and
blocks
the
passage
backward
into
the
auricle
the
blood
having
no
other
way
open
is
forced
through
the
semilunar
valves
into
the
aorta
now
red
in
color
from
its
fresh
oxygen
and
laden
with
nutritive
materials
it
is
distributed
by
the
arteries
to
the
various
tissues
of
the
body
here
it
gives
up
its
oxygen
and
certain
nutritive
materials
to

and
receives
certain

of

consists

of

from

vein

to
the
hepatic
vein
the

of

intestines
spleen
and

is
gathered
into
veins
which
unite
into
a
single
trunk
called
the
portal
vein
the
blood
thus
laden
with
certain
products
of
digestion
is
carried
to
the
liver
by
the
portal
vein
mingling
with
that
supplied
to
the
capillaries
of
the

organ
by
the
hepatic
artery
from
these

the
blood
is
carried
by
small
veins

the

note
if

be
laid
flat
over
the

wall
on
the
left
between
the
fifth
and
sixth
ribs
the
heart
will
be
felt
beating
this
movement
is
known
as
the
beat
or
impulse
of
the
heart
and
can
be
both
seen
and
felt
on
the
left
side
the
is
unusually
strong
during
active
bodily
exertion
and
under
mental
excitement
the
impulse
of
the
heart
is
due
to
the
striking
of
the
lower
tense
part
of
the
apex
of
the
the
chest
wall
at
the
moment
of
their
vigorous
contraction
it

physician
to
know
the
exact
place
where
the
should
be

the
heart

be
displaced

sounds
also
accompany

action
if

ear
be

of

two
distinct
sounds
will
be
heard
following
one
another
with

regularity
their
character
may
be
tolerably
imitated
by
pronouncing
the
syllables
one
sound
is
heard
immediately
after
the
other
then
there

then
come
the
two
sounds
again
the
first
is
a

muffled
sound
known
as
the
sound
followed
at
once
by
a
short
and
sharper
sound
known
as
the
of
the
heart
the
precise
cause
of
the
first
sound
is
still
doubtful
but
it
is
made
at
the
moment
the
ventricles
contract
the
second
sound
is
without
doubt
caused
by
the
sudden
closure
of
the
semilunar

of

the
sounds
of

are

or
masked
by
blowing
when
the
cardiac
orifices
or
valves
are
roughened
dilated
or
otherwise
affected
as
the
result
of
disease
hence
these
new
sounds
may
often
afford
indications
of
the
greatest
importance
to
physicians
in
the
diagnosis
of
the
nervous
control
of
the
heart
the
regular
rhythmic
movement
of
the
heart
is
maintained
by
the
action
of
certain
nerves
in
various
places
in
the
substance
of
the
heart
are
masses
of
nerve
matter
called
ganglia
from
these
ganglia
there
proceed
at
regular
intervals
discharges
of
nerve
energy
some
of
which
excite
movement
while
others
seem
to
restrain
it
the
heart
would
quickly
become
exhausted
if
the
exciting
ganglia
had
it
all
their
own
way
while
it
would
stand
still
if
the
restraining
ganglia
had
full
sway
the
influence
of
one
however
modifies
the
other
and
the
result
is
a
moderate
and
regular
activity
of
the
heart
the
heart
is
also
subject
to
other
nerve
influences
but
from
outside
of
itself
two
nerves
are
connected
with
the
heart
the
pneumogastric
and
the
sympathetic
secs
and
the
former
appears
to
be
connected
with
the
restraining
ganglia
the
latter
with
the
exciting
ganglia
thus
if
a
person
were
the
subject
of
some
emotion
which
caused
fainting
the
explanation
would
be
that
the
impression
had
been
conveyed
to
the
brain
and
from
the
brain
to
the
heart
by
the
pneumogastric
nerves
the
result
would
be
that
the
heart
for
an
instant
ceases
to
beat
death
would
be
the
result
if
the
nerve
influence
were
so
great
as
to
restrain
the
movements
of
the
heart
for
any
appreciable
time
again
if
the
person
were
the
subject
of
some
emotion
by
which
the
heart
were
beating
faster
than
usual
it
would
mean
that
there
was
sent
from
the
brain
to
the
heart
by
the
sympathetic
nerves
the
impression
which
stimulated
it
to
increased
activity
the
nervous
control
of
the
the
tone
and
caliber
of
the
are
controlled
by
certain
nerves
which
are
distributed
among
the
muscular
fibers
of
the
walls
these
nerves
are
governed
from
a
center
in
the
medulla
oblongata
a
part
of
the
brain
sec
if
the
nerves
are
stimulated
more
than
usual
the
muscular
walls
contract
and
the
quantity
of
the
blood
flowing
through
them
and
the
supply
to
the
part
are
diminished
again
if
the
stimulus
is
less
than
usual
the
vessels
dilate
and
the
supply
to
the
part
is
increased
now
the
center
may
be
excited
to
increased
activity
by
influences
reaching
it
from
various
parts
of
the
body
or
even
from
the
brain
itself
as
a
result
the
nerves
are
stimulated
and
the
vessels
contract
again
the
normal
influence
of
the
center
may
be
suspended
for
a
time
by
what
is
known
as
the
inhibitory
or
restraining
effect
the
result
is
that
the
tone
of
the
becomes
diminished
and
their
channels
widen
the
effect
of
this
power
of
the
nervous
system
is
to
give
it
a
certain
control
over
the
circulation
in
particular
parts
thus
though
the
force
of
the
heart
and
the
general
average
remain
the
same
the
state
of
the
circulation
may
be
very
different
in
different
parts
of
the
body
the
importance
of
this
local
control
over
the
circulation
is
of
the
utmost
significance
thus
an
organ
at
work
needs
to
be
more
richly
supplied
with
blood
than
when
at
rest
for
example
when
the
salivary
glands
need
to
secrete
saliva
and
the
stomach
to
pour
out
gastric
juice
the
arteries
that
supply
these
organs
are
dilated
and
so
the
parts
are
flushed
with
an
extra
supply
of
blood
and
thus
are
aroused
to
greater
activity
again
the
ordinary
supply
of
blood
to
a
part
may
be
lessened
so
that
the
organ
is
reduced
to
a
state
of
inactivity
as
occurs
in
the
case
of
the
brain
during
sleep
we
have
in
the
act
of
blushing
a
visible
example
of
sudden
enlargement
of
the
smaller
arteries
of
the
face
and
neck
called
forth
by
some
mental
emotion
which
acts
on
the
center
and
diminishes
its
activity
the
reverse
condition
occurs
in
the
act
of
turning
pale
then
the
result
of
the
mental
emotion
is
to
cause
the
nerves
to
exercise
a
more
powerful
control
over
the
capillaries
thereby
closing
them
and
thus
shutting
off
the
flow
of
blood

but
by
either
course
the
route
is
direct
enough
and
speedy
enough
to
accomplish
a
vast
amount
of
ruinous
work
the
influence
of
alcohol
upon
the
heart
and

is
produced
mainly
through
the
nervous
system
the
inhibitory

as
we
have

the

exercise
a
restraining
control
over
it
very
much
as

reins

horse
in

this
inhibitory
influence
is
protective
and
sustaining
but
now
comes
the
narcotic
invasion
of
alcoholic
drinks
which
paralyze
the
inhibitory
nerves
with
the
others
and
at
once
the
uncontrolled
heart
like

unchecked
steed
plunges

violent
and

destructive

this
action
because
it
is
quicker
has
been
considered
also
a
stronger
action
and
the
alcohol
has
therefore
been
supposed
to
produce
a
stimulating
effect
but
later
researches
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
effect
of
alcoholic
liquors
is
not
properly
that
of
a
stimulant
but
of
a
narcotic
paralyzant
and
that
while
it
indeed
quickens
it
also
really
weakens
the
action
this
view
would
seem
sustained
by
the
fact
that
the
more
the
intoxicants
are
pushed
the
deeper
are
the
narcotic
and
paralyzing
effects
after
having
obstructed
the
nutritive
and
reparative
functions
of
the
vital
fluid
for
many
years
their
effects
at
last
may
become
fatal
this
relaxing
effect
involves
not
only
the
heart
but
also
the
capillary
system
as
is
shown
in
the
complexion
of
the

in

the

course
not
the

chapter

respiration
nature
and
object
of
respiration
the
blood
as
we
have
learned
not
only
provides
material
for
the
growth
and
activity
of
all
the
tissues
of
the
body
but
also
serves
as
a
means
of
removing
from
them
the
products
of
their
activity
these
are
waste
products
which
if
allowed
to
remain
would
impair
the
health
of
the
tissues
thus
the
blood
becomes
impoverished
both
by
the
addition
of
waste
material
and
from
the
loss
of
its
nutritive
matter
we
have
shown
in
the
preceding
chapter
how
the
blood
carries
to
the
tissues
the
nourishment
it
has
absorbed
from
the
food
we
have
now
to
consider
a
new
source
of
nourishment
to
the
blood
that
which
it
receives
from
the
oxygen
of
the
air
we
are
also
to
learn
one
of
the
methods
by
which
the
blood
gets
rid
of
poisonous
waste
matters
in
brief
we
are
to
study
the
set
of
processes
known
as
respiration
by
which
oxygen
is
supplied
to
the
various
tissues
and
by
which
the
principal
waste
matters
or
chief
products
of
oxidation
are
removed
now
the
tissues
are
continually
feeding
on
the
oxygen
and
at
the
same
time
are
continually
producing
carbon
dioxid
and
other
waste
products
in
fact
the
life
of
the
tissues
is
dependent
upon
a
continual
succession
of
oxidations
and
deoxidations
when
the
blood
leaves
the
tissues
it
is
poorer
in
oxygen
is
burdened
with
carbon
dioxid
and
has
had
its
color
changed
from
bright
scarlet
to
purple
red
this
is
the
change
from
the
arterial
to
venous
conditions
which
has
been
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
now
as
we
have
seen
the
change
from
venous
to
arterial
blood
occurs
in
the
capillaries
of
the
lungs
the
only
means
of
communication
between
the
pulmonary
arteries
and
the
pulmonary
veins
the
blood
in
the
pulmonary
capillaries
is
separated
from
the
air
only
by
a
delicate
tissue
formed
of
its
own
wall
and
the
pulmonary
membrane
hence
a
gaseous
interchange
the
essential
step
in
respiration
very
readily
takes
place
between
the
blood
and
the
air
by
which
the
latter
gains
moisture
and
carbon
dioxid
and
loses
its
oxygen
these
changes
in
the
lungs
also
restore
to
the
dark
blood
its
rosy
tint
the
only
condition
absolutely
necessary
to
the
purification
of
the
blood
is
an
organ
having
a
delicate
membrane
on
one
side
of
which
is
a
thin
sheet
of
blood
while
the
other
side
is
in
such
contact
with
the
air
that
an
interchange
of
gases
can
readily
take
place
the
demand
for
oxygen
is
however
so
incessant
and
the
accumulation
of
carbon
dioxid
is
so
rapid
in
every
tissue
of
the
human
body
that
an
creator
has
provided
a
most
perfect
but
complicated
set
of
machinery
to
effect
this
wonderful
purification
of
the
blood
we
are
now
ready
to
begin
the
study
of
the
arrangement
and
working
of
the
respiratory
apparatus
with
its
consideration
we
complete
our
view
of
the
sources
of
supply
to
the
blood
and
begin
our
study
of
its
purification

the

the

the

of

consists
of
a
series
of
rhythmical
movements
succeeding
one
another
in
regular
order
in
the
first
movement
inspiration
the
chest
rises
and
there
is
an
inrush
of
fresh
air
this
is
at
once
followed
by
expiration
the
falling
of
the
chest
walls
and
the
output
of
air
a
pause
now
occurs
and
the
same
breathing
movements
are
repeated
the
entrance
and
the
exit
of
air
into
the
respiratory
passages
are
accompanied
with
peculiar
sounds
which
are
readily
heard
on
placing
the
ear
at
the
chest
wall
these
sounds
are
greatly
modified
in
various
pulmonary
diseases
and
hence
are
of
great
value
to
the
physician
in
making
a
correct
diagnosis
in
a
healthy
adult
the
number
of
respirations
should
be
from
to
per
minute
but
they
vary
with
age
that
of
a
newly
born
child
being
for
the

time
exercise
increases
the
number
while
rest
diminishes
it
in
standing
the
rate
is
more
than
when
lying

mental
emotion
and
excitement

a
notable
effect
upon
the
frequency
of

and
the

be
alarmingly
increased

the

the
mechanism
of

the

is
a
chamber
with
bony

the

connecting
in
front
with
the
breastbone
and
behind
with
the
spine
the
spaces
between
the
ribs
are
occupied
by
the
intercostal
muscles
while
large
muscles
clothe
the
entire
chest
the
diaphragm
serves
as
a
movable
floor
to
the
chest
which
is
an
chamber
with
movable
walls
and
floor
in
this
chamber
are
suspended
the
lungs
the
air
cells
of
which
communicate
with
the
outside
through
the
bronchial
passages
but
have
no
connection
with
the
chest
cavity
the
thin
space
between
the
lungs
and
the
rib
walls
called
the
pleural
cavity
is
in
health
a
vacuum
now
when
the
diaphragm
contracts
it
descends
and
thus
increases
the
depth
of
the
chest
cavity
a
quantity
of
air
is
now
drawn
into
the
lungs
and
causes
them
to
expand
thus
filling
up
the
increased
space
as
soon
as
the
diaphragm
relaxes
returning
to
its
arched
position
and
reducing
the
size
of
the
chest
cavity
the
air
is
driven
from
the
lungs
which
then
diminish
in
size
after
a
short
pause
the
diaphragm
again
contracts
and
the
same
round
of
operation
is
constantly
repeated
the
walls
of
the
chest
being
movable
by
the
contractions
of
the
intercostals
and
other
muscles
the
ribs
are
raised
and
the
breastbone
pushed
forward
the
chest
cavity
is
thus
enlarged
from
side
to
side
and
from
behind
forwards
thus
by
the
simultaneous
descent
of
the
diaphragm
and
the
elevation
of
the
ribs
the
cavity
of
the
chest
is
increased
in
three
directions
and
from
behind
forwards
it
is
thus
evident
that
inspiration
is
due
to
a
series
of
muscular
contractions
as
soon
as
the
contractions
cease
the
elastic
lung
tissue
resumes
its
original
position
just
as
an
extended

band
recovers
itself
as
a
result
the
original
size
of
the

cavity
is
restored
and
the
inhaled
air
is
driven
from

expiration
may
then
be
regarded
as
the
result
of
an

recoil
and
not
of
active
muscular
contractions

varieties
of
breathing
this
is
the
mechanism
of
quiet
normal
respiration
when
the
respiration
is
difficult
additional
forces
are
brought
into
play
thus
when
the
windpipe
and
bronchial
tubes
are
obstructed
as
in
croup
asthma
or
consumption
many
additional
muscles
are
made
use
of
to
help
the
lungs
to
expand
the
position
which
asthmatics
often
assume
with
arms
raised
to
grasp
something
for
support
is
from
the
need
of
the
sufferer
to
get
a
fixed
point
from
which
the
muscles
of
the
arm
and
chest
may
act
forcibly
in
raising
the
ribs
and
thus
securing
more
comfortable
breathing
the
visible
movements
of
breathing
vary
according
to
circumstances
in
infants
the
action
of
the
diaphragm
is
marked
and
the
movements
of
the
abdomen
are
especially
obvious
this
is
called
abdominal
breathing
in
women
the
action
of
the
ribs
as
they
rise
and
fall
is
emphasized
more
than
in
men
and
this
we
call
costal
breathing
in
young
persons
and
in
men
the
respiration
not
usually
being
impeded
by
tight
clothing
the
breathing
is
normal
being
deep
and
abdominal
disease
has
a
marked
effect
upon
the
mode
of
breathing
thus
when
children
suffer
from
some
serious
chest
disease
the
increased
movements
of
the
abdominal
walls
seem
distressing
so
in
fracture
of
the
ribs
the
surgeon
envelops
the
overlying
part
of
the
chest
with
long
strips
of
firm
adhesive
plaster
to
restrain
the
motions
of
chest
respiration
that
they
may
not
disturb
the
jagged
ends
of
the
broken
bones
again
in
painful
diseases
of
the
abdomen
the
sufferer
instinctively
suspends
the
abdominal
action
and
relies
upon
the
chest
breathing
these
deviations
from
the
natural
movements
of
respiration
are
useful
to
the
physician
in
ascertaining
the
seat
of
disease
the
nervous
control
of
respiration
it
is
a
matter
of
common
experience
that
breath
may
be
held
for
a
short
time
but
the
need
of
fresh
air
speedily
gets
the
mastery
and
a
long
deep
breath
is
drawn
hence
the
efforts
of
criminals
to
commit
suicide
by
persistent
restraint
of
their
breathing
are
always
a
failure
at
the
very
worst
unconsciousness
ensues
and
then
respiration
is
automatically
resumed
thus
a
wise
providence
defeats
the
purpose
of
crime
the
movements
of
breathing
go
on
without
our
attention
in
sleep
the
regularity
of
respiration
is
even
greater
than
when
awake
there
is
a
particular
part
of
the
nervous
system
that
presides
over
the
breathing
function
it
is
situated
in
that
part
of
the

called

effects
of
respiration
upon
the
blood
the
blood
contains
three
gases
partly
dissolved
in
it
and
partly
in
chemical
union
with
certain
of
its
constituents
these
are
oxygen
carbon
dioxid
and
nitrogen
the
latter
need
not
be
taken
into
account
the
oxygen
is
the
nourishing
material
which
the
tissues
require
to
carry
on
their
work
the
carbon
dioxid
is
a
waste
substance
which
the
tissues
produce
by
their
activity
and
which
the
blood
carries
away
from
them
as
before
shown
the
blood
as
it
flows
through
the
tissues
loses
most
of
its
oxygen
and
carbon
dioxid
takes
its
place
now
if
the
blood
is
to
maintain
its
efficiency
in
this
respect
it
must
always
be
receiving
new
supplies
of
oxygen
and
also
have
some
mode
of
throwing
off
its
excess
of
carbon
dioxid
this
then
is
the
double
function
of
the
process
of
respiration
again
the
blood
sent
out
from
the
left
side
of
the
heart
is
of
a
bright
scarlet
color
after
its
work
is
done
and
the
blood
returns
to
the
right
side
of
the
heart
it
is
of
a
dark
purple
color
this
change
in
color
takes
place
in
the
capillaries
and
is
due
to
the
fact
that
there
the
blood
gives
up
most
of
its
oxygen
to
the
tissues
and
receives
from
them
a
great
deal
of
carbon
dioxid
in
brief
while
passing
through
the
capillaries
of
the
lungs
the
blood
has
been
changed
from
the
venous
to
the
arterial
blood
that
is
to
say
the
blood
in
its
progress
through
the
lungs
has
rid
itself
of
its
excess
of
carbon
dioxid
and
obtained
a
fresh
supply
of
oxygen
effects

upon
the

in

it
is
well
known
that
if
two
different
liquids
be
placed
in
a
vessel
in
contact
with
each
other
and
left
undisturbed
they
do
not
remain
separate
but
gradually
mix
and
in
time
will
be
perfectly
combined
this
is
called
diffusion
of
liquids
the
same
thing
occurs
with
gases
though
the
process
is
not
visible
this
is
known
as
the
diffusion
of
gases
it
is
also
true
that
two
liquids
will
mingle
when
separated
from
each
other
by
a
membrane
sec
in
a
similar
manner
two
gases
especially
if
of
different
densities
may
mingle
even
when
separated

in
a
general
way

that
occur

flowing
in
countless

a

well

this

is
the
delicate

of
the

and
the

of

by

it
has
been
found
that
the

is
less
than

that
the

in

is
greater
than
that
in

as
a
result
a
diffusion
of
gases
ensues
the

gains
oxygen
and
loses

it

now
evident

be
constantly

is
contained
in

it
is
not

to
understand
how
these

may
be
conveyed
through

from
the

of
the

to
those
of

healthy
people
such

by

to
fall
victims
to
this
dreaded

overcrowding
poor

dampness
all
tend
to
increase
the
risk

not
be
supposed

the
question
of
a
practicable
and
economical
system
of
ventilation
for
our
homes
schoolrooms
workshops
and
public
places
presents
many
difficult
and
perplexing
problems
it
is
perhaps
due
to
the
complex
nature
of
the
subject
that
ventilation
as
an
ordinary
condition
of
daily
health
has
been
so
much
neglected
the
matter
is
practically
ignored
in
building
ordinary
houses
the
continuous
renewal
of

receives
little
if
any
consideration
compared
with
the
provision
made
to
furnish
our
homes
with
heat
light
and

when
the
windows
are
closed
we
usually
depend
for
ventilation
upon

chance
the
chimney
the
fireplace
and
the
crevices
of
doors
and

the
proper
ventilation
of
a
house
and
its
surroundings
should
form
as
prominent
a
consideration
in
the
plans
of
builders
and
architects
as
do
the
grading
of
the
land
the
size
of
the

and
the
cost
of
heating
the
object
of
ventilation
is
twofold
first
to
provide
for
the
removal
of
the
impure
air
second
for
a
supply
of
pure
air
this
must
include
a
plan
to
provide
fresh
air
in
such
a
manner
that
there
shall
be
no
draughts
or
exposure
of
the
occupants
of
the
rooms
to
undue
temperature
hence
what
at
first
might
seem
an
easy
thing
to
do
is
in
fact
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
sanitary
problems
conditions
of
efficient
ventilation
to
secure
proper
ventilation
certain
conditions
must
be
observed
the
pure
air
introduced
should
not
be
far
below
the
temperature
of
the
room
or
if
so
the
entering
current
should
be
introduced
towards
the
ceiling
that
it
may
mix
with
the
warm
air
draughts
must
be
avoided
if
the
circuit
from
entrance
to
exit
is
short
draughts
are
likely
to
be
produced
and
impure
air
has
less
chance
of
mixing
by
diffusion
with
the
pure
air
the
current
of
air
introduced
should
be
constant
otherwise
the
balance
may
occasionally
be
in
favor
of
vitiated
air
if
a
mode
of
ventilation
prove
successful
it
should
not
be
interfered
with
by
other
means
of
entrance
thus
an
open
door
may
prevent
the
incoming
air
from
passing
through
its
proper
channels
it
is
desirable
that
the
inlet
be
so
arranged
that
it
can
be
diminished
in
size
or
closed
altogether
for
instance
when
the
outer
air
is
very
cold
or
the
wind
blows
directly
into
the
inlet
the
amount
of
cold
air
entering
it
may
lower
the
temperature
of
the
room
to
an
undesirable
degree
in
brief
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
thorough
mixing
of
pure
and
impure
air
so
that
the
combination
at
different
parts
of
the
room
may
be
fairly
uniform
to
secure
these
results
the
inlets
and
outlets
should
be
arranged
upon
principles
of
ventilation
generally
accepted
by
authorities
on
public
health
it
seems
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
due
attention
must
be
paid
to
the
source
from
which
the
introduced
air
is
drawn
if
it
be
taken
from
foul
cellars
or
from
dirty
streets
it
may
be
as
impure
as
that
which
it
is
designed
to

animal
or
vital
heat
if
a
thermometer
made
for
the
purpose
be
placed
for
five
minutes
in
the
armpit
or
under
the
tongue
it
will
indicate
a
temperature
of
about
whether
the
surrounding
atmosphere
be
warm
or
cold
this
is
the
natural
heat
of
a
healthy
person
and
in
health
it
rarely
varies
more
than
a
degree
or
two
but
as
the
body
is
constantly
losing
heat
by
radiation
and
conduction
it
is
evident
that
if
the
standard
temperature
be
maintained
a
certain
amount
of
heat
must
be
generated
within
the
body
to
make
up
for
the
loss
externally
the
heat
thus
produced
is
known
as
animal
or
vital
heat
this
generation
of
heat
is
common
to
all
living
organisms
when
the
mass

the

in

it
is

oxidation
the
vital
part
of
the
tissues
built
up
from
the
complex
classes
of
food
is
oxidized
by
means
of
the
oxygen
carried
by
the
arterial
blood
and
broken
down
into
simpler
bodies
which
at
last
result
in
urea
carbon
dioxid
and
water
wherever
there
is
life
this
process
of
oxidation
is
going
on
but
more
energetically
in
some
tissues
and
organs
than
in
others
in
other
words
the
minutest
tissue
in
the
body
is
a
source
of
heat
in
proportion
to
the
activity
of
its
chemical
changes
the
more
active
the
changes
the
greater
is
the
heat
produced
and
the
greater
the
amount
of
urea
carbon
dioxid
and
water
eliminated
the
waste
caused
by
this
oxidation
must
be
made
good
by
a
due
supply
of
food
to
be
built
up
into
protoplasmic
material
for
the
production
of
heat
therefore
food
is
necessary
but
the
oxidation
process
is
not
as
simple
and
direct
as
the
statement
of
it
might
seem
to
indicate
though
complicated
in
its
various
stages
the
ultimate
result
is
as
simple
as
in
ordinary
combustion
outside
of
the
body
and
the
products
are
the
same
the
continual
chemical
changes
then
chiefly
by
oxidation
of
combustible
materials
in
the
tissues
produce
an
amount
of
heat
which
is
efficient
to
maintain
the
temperature
of
the
living
body
at
about
this
process
of
oxidation
provides
not
only
for
the
heat
of
the
body
but
also
for
the
energy
required
to
carry
on
the
muscular
work
of
the
animal
organism
regulation
of
the
bodily
temperature
while
bodily
heat
is
being
continually
produced
it
is
also
as
continually
being
lost
by
the
lungs
by
the
skin
and
to
some
extent
by
certain
excretions
the
blood
in
its
swiftly
flowing
current
carries
warmth
from
the
tissues
where
heat
is
being
rapidly
generated
to
the
tissues
or
organs
in
which
it
is
being
lost
by
radiation
conduction
or
evaporation
were
there
no
arrangement
by
which
heat
could
be
distributed
and
regulated
the
temperature
of
the
body
would
be
very
unequal
in
different
parts
and
would
vary
at
different
times
the
normal
temperature
is
maintained
with
slight
variations
throughout
life
indeed
a
change
of
more
than
a
degree
above
or
below
the
average
indicates
some
failure
in
the
organism
or
some
unusual
influence
it
is
evident
then
that
the
mechanisms
which
regulate
the
temperature
of
the
body
must
be
exceedingly
sensitive
the
two
chief
means
of
regulating
the
temperature
of
the
body
are
the
lungs
and
the
skin
as
a
means
of
lowering
the
temperature
the
lungs
and
air
passages
are
very
inferior
to
the
skin
although
by
giving
heat
to
the
air
we
breathe
they
stand
next
to
the
skin
in
importance
as
a
regulating
power
they
are
altogether
subordinate
to
the
skin
experiment
show
the
natural
temperature
of
the
borrow
a
clinical
thermometer
and
take
your
own
temperature
and
that
of
several
friends
by
placing
the
instrument
under
the
tongue
closing
the
mouth
and
holding
it
there
for
five
minutes
it
should
be
thoroughly
cleansed
after
each
use
the
skin
as
a
the
great
regulator
of
the
bodily
temperature
is
undoubtedly
the
skin
which
performs
this
function
by
means
of
a
apparatus
with
a
more
or
less
double
action
first
the
skin
regulates
the
loss
of
heat
by
means
of
the
mechanism
the
more
blood
passes
through
the
skin
the
greater
will
be
the
loss
of
heat
by
conduction
radiation
and
evaporation
hence
any
action
of
the
mechanism
which
causes
dilatation
of
the
cutaneous
capillaries
leads
to
a
larger
flow
of
blood
through
the
skin
and
will
tend
to
cool
the
body
on
the
other
hand
when
by
the
same
mechanism
the
cutaneous
vessels
are
constricted
there
will
be
a
smaller
flow
of
blood
through
the
skin
which
will
serve
to
check
the
loss
of
heat
from
the
body
secs
and
again
the
special
nerves
of
perspiration
act
directly
as
regulators
of
temperature
they
increase
the
loss
of
heat
when
they
promote
the
secretion
of
the
skin
and
diminish
the
loss
when
they
cease
to
promote
it
the
practical
working
of
this
mechanism
is
well
shown
by
exercise
the
bodily
temperature
rarely
rises
so
much
as
a
degree
during
vigorous
exercise
the
respiration
is
increased
the
cutaneous
capillaries
become
dilated
from
the
quickened
circulation
and
a
larger
amount
of
blood
is
circulating
through
the
skin
besides
this
the
skin
perspires
freely
a
large
amount
of
heat
is
thus
lost
to
the
body
sufficient
to
offset
the
addition
caused
by
the
muscular
contractions
it
is
owing
to
the
wonderful
elasticity
of
the
mechanism
and
to
the
increase
in
respiratory
activity
and
the
consequent
increase
in
the
amount
of
watery
vapor
given
off
by
the
lungs
that
men
are
able
to
endure
for
days
an
atmosphere
warmer
than
the
blood
and
even
for
a
short
time
at
a
temperature
above
that
of
boiling
water
the
temperature
of
a
turkish
bath
may
be
as
high
as
to
but
an
atmospheric
temperature
may
be
considerably
below
this
and
yet
if
long
continued
becomes
dangerous
to
life
in
august
for
instance
hundreds
of
persons
died
in
this
country
within
a
few
days
from
the
effects
of
the
excessive
heat
a
much
higher
temperature
may
be
borne
in
dry
air
than
in
humid
air
or
that
which
is
saturated
with
watery
vapor
thus
a
shade
temperature
of
in
the
dry
air
of
a
high
plain
may
be
quite
tolerable
while
a
temperature
of
in
the
atmosphere
of
less
elevated
regions
is
oppressive
the
reason
is
that
in
dry
air
the
sweat
evaporates
freely
and
cools
the
skin
in
saturated
air
at
the
bodily
temperature
there
is
little
loss
of
heat
by
perspiration
or
by
evaporation
from
the
bodily
surface
this
topic
is
again
discussed
in
the
description
of
the
skin
as
a
regulator
of
the
bodily
temperature
sec
voluntary
means
of
regulating
the
temperature
the
voluntary
factor
as
a
means
of
regulating
the
heat
loss
in
man
is
one
of
great
importance
clothing
retards
the
loss
of
heat
by
keeping
in
contact
with
it
a
layer
of
still
air
which
is
an
exceedingly
bad
conductor
when
a
man
feels
too
warm
and
throws
off
his
coat
he
removes
one
of
the
badly
conducting
layers
of
air
and
increases
the
heat
loss
by
radiation
and
conduction
the
vapor
next
the
skin
is
thus
allowed
a
freer
access
to
the
surface
and
the
loss
of
heat
by
evaporation
of
the
sweat
becomes
greater
this
voluntary
factor
by
which
the
equilibrium
is
maintained
must
be
regarded
as
of
great
importance
this
power
also
exists
in
the
lower
animals
but
to
a
much
smaller
extent
thus
a
dog
on
a
hot
day
runs
out
his
tongue
and
stretches
his
limbs
so
as
to
increase
the
surface
from
which
heat
is
radiated
and
conducted
the
production
like
the
loss
of
heat
is
to
a
certain
extent
under
the
control
of
the
will
work
increases
the
production
of
heat
and
rest
especially
sleep
lessens
it
thus
the
inhabitants
of
very
hot
countries
seek
relief
during
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
by
a
siesta
the
quantity
and
quality
of
food
also
influence
the
production
of
heat
a
larger
quantity
of
food
is
taken
in
winter
than
in
summer
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
northern
and
arctic
regions
the
daily
consumption
of
food
is
far
greater
than
in
temperate
and
tropical
climates
effect
of
alcohol
upon
the
lungs
it
is
a
well
recognized
fact
that
alcohol
when
taken
into
the
stomach
is
carried
from
that
organ
to
the
liver
where
by
the
baneful
directness
of
its
presence
it
produces
a
speedy
and
often
disastrous
effect
but
the
trail
of
its
malign
power
does
not
disappear
there
from
the
liver
it
passes
to
the
right
side
of
the
heart
and
thence
to
the
lungs
where
its
influence
is
still
for
harm
in
the
lungs
alcohol
tends
to
check
and
diminish
the
breathing
capacity
of
these
organs
this
effect
follows
from
the
partial
paralyzing
influence
of
the
stupefying
agent
upon
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
diminishing
its
sensibility
to
the
impulse
of
healthful
respiration
this
diminished
capacity
for
respiration
is
clearly
shown
by
the
use
of
the
a
simple
instrument
which
accurately
records
the
cubic
measure
of
the
lungs
and
proves
beyond
denial
the
decrease
of
the
lung
space
familiar
and
most
dangerous
is
the
drinking
inability
to
resist
lung
adoph
frick
the
eminent
german
physiologist
of
zurich
instead
of
preventing
consumption
as
was
once
believed
reduces
the
vitality
so
much
as
to
render
the
system
unusually
susceptible
to
that
fatal
tracy
sanitary

alcoholic

present
in

portion
of

more
frequently
than
in
other
cases
of

is
no
form
of
consumption
so
fatal
as
that

alcohol
medicines
affect
the
disease
but
little
the
most
judicious
diet
fails
and
change
of
air
accomplishes
but
slight
real
good
in
plain
terms
there
is
no
remedy
whatever
for
alcoholic
phthisis
it
may
be
delayed
in
its
course
but
it
is
never
stopped
and
not
infrequently
instead
of
being
delayed
it
runs
on
to
a
fatal
termination
more
rapidly
than
is
common
in
any
other
type
of
the
richardson
in
of
modern
other
results
of
intoxicants
upon
the
lungs
but
a
more
potent
injury
to
the
lungs
comes
from
another
cause
the
lungs
are
the
arena
where
is
carried
on
the
ceaseless
interchange
of
elements
that
is
necessary
to
the
processes
of
life
here
the
dark
venous
blood
loaded
with
effete
material
lays
down
its
carbon
burden
and
with
the
brightening
company
of
oxygen
begins
again
its
circuit
but
the
enemy
intrudes
and
the
use
of
alcohol
tends
to
prevent
this
benign
interchange
the
continued
congestion
of
the
lung
tissue
results
in
its
becoming
thickened
and
hardened
thus
obstructing
the
absorption
of
oxygen
and
the
escape
of
carbon
dioxid
besides
this
alcohol
destroys
the
integrity
of
the
red
globules
causing
them
to
shrink
and
harden
and
impairing
their
power
to
receive
oxygen
thus
the
blood
that
leaves
the
lungs
conveys
an
excess
of
the
poisonous
carbon
dioxid
and
a
deficiency
of
the
needful
oxygen
this
is
plainly
shown
in
the
purplish
countenance
of
the
inebriate
crowded
with
enlarged
veins
this
discoloration
of
the
face
is
in
a
measure
reproduced
upon
the
congested
mucous
membrane
of
the
lungs
it
is
also
proved
beyond
question
by
the
decreased
amount
of
carbon
dioxid
thrown
off
in
the
expired
breath
of
any
person
who
has
used
alcoholics
the
enfeebled
respiration
explains
though
it
is
only
one
of
the
reasons
why
inebriates
can
not
endure
vigorous
and
prolonged
exertion
as
can
a
healthy
person
the
hurried
circulation
produced
by
intoxicants
involves
in
turn
quickened
respiration
which
means
more
rapid
exhaustion
of
the
life
forces
the
use
of
intoxicants
involves
a
repeated
dilatation
of
the
capillaries
which
steadily
diminishes
their
defensive
power
rendering
the
person
more
liable
to
yield
to
the
invasion
of
pulmonary
diseases
effect
of
alcoholics
upon
disease
a
theory
has
prevailed
to
a
limited
extent
that
the
use
of
intoxicants
may
act
as
a
preventive
of
consumption
the
records
of
medical
science
fail
to
show
any
proof
whatever
to
support
this
impression
no
error
could
be
more
serious
or
more
misleading
for
the
truth
is
in
precisely
the
opposite
direction
instead
of
preventing
alcohol
tends
to
develop
consumption
many
physicians
of
large
experience
record
the
existence
of
a
distinctly
recognized
alcoholic
consumption
attacking
those
constitutions
broken
down
by
dissipation
this
form
of
consumption
is
steadily
progressive
and
always
fatal
the
constitutional
debility
produced
by
the
habit
of
using
alcoholic
beverages
tends
to
render
one
a
prompt
victim
to
the

effect
of
tobacco
upon
the
respiratory
passages
the
effects
of
tobacco
upon
the
throat
and
lungs
are
frequently
very
marked
and
persistent
the
hot
smoke
must
very
naturally
be
an
irritant
as
the
mouth
and
nostrils
were
not
made
as
a
chimney
for
heated
and
narcotic
vapors
the
smoke
is
an
irritant
both
by
its
temperature
and
from
its
destructive
ingredients
the
carbon
soot
and
the
ammonia
which
it
conveys
it
irritates
and
dries
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
mouth
and
throat
producing
an
unnatural
thirst
which
becomes
an
enticement
to
the
use
of
intoxicating
liquors
the
inflammation
of
the
mouth
and
throat
is
apt
to
extend
up
the
eustachian
tube
thus
impairing
the
sense
of
hearing
but
even
these
are
not
all
the
bad
effects
of
tobacco
the
inhalation
of
the
poisonous
smoke
produces
unhealthful
effects
upon
the
delicate
mucous
membrane
of
the
bronchial
tubes
and
of
the
lungs
upon
the
former
the
effect
is
to
produce
an
irritating
cough
with
short
breath
and
chronic
bronchial
catarrh
the
pulmonary
membrane
is
congested
taking
cold
becomes
easy
and
recovery
from
it
tedious
frequently
the
respiration
is
seriously
disturbed
thus
the
blood
is
imperfectly
aërated
and
so
in
turn
the
nutrition
of
the
entire
system
is
impaired
the
cigarette
is
the
defiling
medium
through
which
these
direful
results
frequently

the
elimination
of
waste
products
we
have
traced
the
food
from
the
alimentary
canal
into
the
blood
we
have
learned
that
various
food
materials
prepared
by
the
digestive
processes
are
taken
up
by
the
branches
of
the
portal
vein
or
by
the
lymphatics
and
carried
into
the
blood
current
the
nutritive
material
thus
absorbed
is
conveyed
by
the
blood
plasma
and
the
lymph
to
the
various
tissues
to
provide
them
with
nourishment
we
have
learned
also
that
oxygen
taken
up
in
the
air
cells
of
the
lungs
is
being
continually
carried
to
the
tissues
and
that
the
blood
is
purified
by
being
deprived
in
the
lungs
of
its
excess
of
carbon
dioxid
from
this
tissue
activity
which
is
mainly
oxidation
are
formed
certain
waste
products
which
as
we
have
seen
are
absorbed
by
the
capillaries
and
lymphatics
and
carried
into
the
venous
circulation
in
their
passage
through
the
blood
and
tissues
the
albumens
sugars
starches
and
fats
are
converted
into
carbon
dioxid
water
and
urea
or
some
closely
allied
body
certain
articles
of
food
also
contain
small
amounts
of
sulphur
and
phosphorus
which
undergo
oxidation
into
sulphates
and
phosphates
we
speak
then
of
carbon
dioxid
salts

waste
products
of
the
animal
economy
these
leave
the
body
by
one
of
the
three
main
channels
lungs
the
skin
or
the
kidneys
the
elimination
of
these
products
is
brought
about
by
a
special
apparatus
called
organs
of
excretion
the
substances
themselves
are
called
excretions
as
opposed
to
secretions
which
are
elaborated
for
use
in
the
body
see

as
already
shown
the
lungs
are
the
main
channels
for
the
elimination
of
carbon
dioxid

portion
of

vapor
by
the
skin
the
body
gets
rid
of
a
small
portion
of
salts
a
little
carbon
dioxid

a
large
amount
of
water
in
the
form
of
perspiration
from
the
kidneys

it

the
outer

is
an
important
organ
of
sensibility

in
some
parts
it
is
closely
attached
to
the
structures
beneath
while
in
others
it
is
less
firmly
adherent
and
rests
upon
a
variable
amount
of
fatty
tissue
it
thus
assists
in
relieving
the
abrupt

in

it

often
observed
that
the

more
abundant

the
largest
and
most
important
some
carbon
dioxid
passes
out
through
the
skin
but
not
more
than
as
much
as
escapes
by
the
lungs
the
sweat
ordinarily
passes
off
as
vapor
if
there
is
no
obvious
perspiration
we
must
not
infer
that
the
skin
is
inactive
since
sweat
is
continually
passing
from
the
surface
though
often
it
may
not
be
apparent
on
an
average
from
to
pounds
of
sweat
are
eliminated
daily
from
the
skin
in
the
form
of
vapor
this
is
double
the
amount
excreted
by
the
lungs
and
averages
about
of
the
weight
of
the
body
the
visible
sweat
or
sensible
perspiration
becomes
abundant
during
active
exercise
after
copious
drinking
of
cold
water
on
taking
certain
drugs
and
when
the
body
is
exposed
to
excessive
warmth
forming
more
rapidly
than
it
evaporates
it
collects
in
drops
on
the
surface
the
disagreeable
sensations
produced
by
humid
weather
result
from
the
fact
that
the
atmosphere
is
so
loaded
with
vapor
that
the
moisture
of
the
skin
is
slowly
removed
by
evaporation
experiment
study
the
openings
of
the
sweat
glands
with
the
aid
of
a
strong

are
conveniently
examined
on
the
palms
a
weight
may
be
considerably
reduced
within
a
short
time
by
loss
through
the
perspiration
alone
this
may
explain
to
some
extent
the
weakening
effect
of
profuse
perspiration
as
from
night
sweats
of
consumption
convalescence
from
typhoid
fever
or
the
artificial
sweating
from
taking
certain
drugs
the
skin
as
a
regulator
of
the
temperature
of
the
body
we
thus
learn
that
the
skin
covers
and
protects
the
more
delicate
structures
beneath
it
and
that
it
also
serves
as
an
important
organ
of
excretion
by
means
of
the
sweat
the
skin
performs
a
third
and
a
most
important
function
that
of
regulating
the
temperature
of
the
body
the
of
the
skin
like
those
of
other
parts
of
the
body
are
under
the
control
of
the
nervous
system
which
regulates
their
diameter
if
the
nervous
control
be
relaxed
the
dilate
more
blood
flows
through
them
and
more
material
is
brought
to
the
glands
of
the
skin
to
be
acted
upon
external
warmth
relaxes
the
skin
and
its
there
results
an
increased
flow
of
blood
to
the
skin
with
increased
perspiration
external
cold
on
the
other
hand
contracts
the
skin
and
its
producing
a
diminished
supply
of
blood
and
a
diminished
amount
of
sweat
now
it
is
a
law
of
physics
that
the
change
from
liquid
to
vapor
involves
a
loss
of
heat
a
few
drops
of
ether
or
of
any
volatile
liquid
placed
on
the
skin
produce
a
marked
sense
of
coldness
because
the
heat
necessary
to
change
the
liquid
into
vapor
has
been
drawn
rapidly
from
the
skin
this
principle
holds
good
for
every
particle
of
sweat
that
reaches
the
mouth
of
a
sweat
gland
as
the
sweat
evaporates
it
absorbs
a
certain
amount
of
heat
and
cools
the
body
to
that
extent
how
the
action
of
the
skin
may
be
modified
after
profuse
sweating
we
feel
chilly
from
the
evaporation
of
a
large
amount
of
moisture
which
rapidly
cools
the
surface
when
the
weather
is
very
warm
the
evaporation
tends
to
prevent
the
bodily
temperature
from
rising
on
the
other
hand
if
the
weather
be
cold
much
less
sweat
is
produced
the
loss
of
heat
from
the
body
is
greatly
lessened
and
its
temperature
prevented
from
falling
thus
it
is
plain
why
medicine
is
given
and
other
efforts
are
made
to
sweat
the
fever
patient
the
increased
activity
of
the
skin
helps
to
reduce
the
bodily
heat
the
sweat
glands
are
under
the
control
of
certain
nerve
fibers
originating
in
the
spinal
cord
and
are
not
necessarily
excited
to
action
by
an
increased
flow
of
blood
through
the
skin
in
other
words
the
sweat
glands
may
be
stimulated
to
increased
action
both
by
an
increased
flow
of
blood
and
also
by
reflex
action
upon
the
nerves
of
the
parts
these
two
agencies
while
working
in
harmony
through
the
produce
phenomena
which
are
essentially
independent
of
each
other
thus
a
strong
emotion
like
fear
may
cause
a
profuse
sweat
to
break
out
with
cold
pallid
skin
during
a
fever
the
skin
may
be
hot
and
its
vessels
full
of
blood
and
yet
there
may
be
no
perspiration

is
a

both
excrete

in

the

although
the

of

constant
necessity
for
personal
cleanliness
it
is
evident
that
the
skin
with
its
myriads
of
nerves
and
sweat
and
oil
glands
is
an
exceedingly
complicated
and
important
structure
the
surface
is
continually
casting
off
perspiration
oily
material
and
dead
scales
by
friction
and
regular
bathing
we
get
rid
of
these
waste
materials
if
this
be
not
thoroughly
done
the
oily
secretion
holds
the
particles
of
waste
substances
to
the
surface
of
the
body
while
dust
and
dirt
collect
and
form
a
layer
upon
the
skin
when
we
remember
that
this
dirt
consists
of
a
great
variety
of
dust
particles
poisonous
matters
and
sometimes
germs
of
disease
we
may
well
be
impressed
with
the
necessity
of
personal
cleanliness
this
layer
of
foreign
matter
on
the
skin
is
in
several
ways
injurious
to
health
it
clogs
the
pores
and
retards
perspiration
thus
checking
the
proper
action
of
the
skin
as
one
of
the
chief
means
of
getting
rid
of
the
waste
matters
of
the
body
hence
additional
work
is
thrown
upon
other
organs
chiefly
the
lungs
and
the
kidneys
which
already
have
enough
to
do
this
extra
work
they
can
do
for
only
a
short
time
sooner
or
later
they
become
disordered
and
illness
follows
moreover
as
this
unwholesome
layer
is
a
fertile
soil
in
which
bacteria
may
develop
many
skin
diseases
may
result
from
this
neglect
it
is
also
highly
probable
that
germs
of
disease
thus
adherent
to
the
skin
may
then
be
absorbed
into
the
system
parasitic
skin
diseases
are
thus
greatly
favored
by
the
presence
of
an
unclean
skin
it
is
also
a
fact
that
uncleanly
people
are
more
liable
to
take
cold
than
those
who
bathe
often
the
importance
of
cleanliness
would
thus
seem
too
apparent
to
need
special
mention
were
it
not
that
the
habit
is
so
much
neglected
the
old
and
excellent
definition
that
dirt
is
suitable
matter
but
in
the
wrong
place
suggests
that
the
place
should
be
changed
this
can
be
done
only
by
regular
habits
of
personal
cleanliness
not
only
of
the
skin
the
hair
the
teeth
the
nails
and
the
clothing
but
also
by
the
rigid
observance
of
a
proper
system
in
daily
living
baths
and
bathing
in
bathing
we
have
two
distinct
objects
in
view
keep
the
skin
clean
and
to
impart
vigor
these
are
closely
related
for
to
remove
from
the
body
material
which
tends
to
injure
it
is
a
direct
means
of
giving
vigor
to
all
the
tissues
thus
a
cold
bath
acts
upon
the
nervous
system
and
calls
out
in
response
to
the
temporary
abstraction
of
heat
a
freer
play
of
the
general
vital
powers
bathing
is
so
useful
both
locally
and
constitutionally
that
it
should
be
practiced
to
such
an
extent
as
experience
proves
to
be
beneficial
for
the
general
surface
the
use
of
hot
water
once
a
week
fulfills
the
demands
of
cleanliness
unless
in
special
occupations
whether
we
should
bathe
in
hot
or
cold
water
depends
upon
circumstances
most
persons
especially
the
young
and
vigorous
soon
become
accustomed
to
cool
and
even
cold
water
baths
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
the
hot
bath
should
be
taken
at
night
before
going
to
bed
as
in
the
morning
there
is
usually
more
risk
of
taking
cold
the
body
is
readily
chilled
if
exposed
to
cold
when
the
of
the
skin
have
been
relaxed
by
heat
hot
baths
besides
their
use
for
the
purposes
of
cleanliness
have
a
sedative
influence
upon
the
nervous
system
tending
to
allay
restlessness
and
weariness
they
are
excellent
after
severe
physical
or
mental
work
and
give
a
feeling
of
restful
comfort

cleansing
than
hot

serve
as
an
excellent
tonic
and

to

the
best
and
most
convenient
time
for
a
cold

is
in
the
morning
immediately
after
rising
to
the
healthy
and
vigorous
it
is
if
taken
at
this
time
with
proper
precautions
a
most
agreeable
and
healthful
luxury
the
sensation
of
chilliness
first
felt
is
caused
by
the
contraction
of
the
skin
and
its
so
that
the
blood
is
forced
back
as
it
were
into
the
deeper
parts
of
the
body
this
stimulates
the
nervous
system
the
breathing
becomes
quicker
and
deeper
the
heart
beats
more
vigorously
and
as
a
consequence
the
warm
blood
is
sent
back
to
the
skin
with
increased
force
this
is
known
as
the
stage
of
reaction
which
is
best
increased
by
friction
with
a
rough
towel
this
should
produce
the
pleasant
feeling
of
a
warm
glow
all
over
the
body
a
cold
bath
which
is
not
followed
by
reaction
is
likely
to
do
more
harm
than
good
the
lack
of
this
reaction
may
be
due
to
the
water
being
too
cold
the
bath
too
prolonged
or
to
the

being
in
a
low

the

is
the
main
secret
of

the
temperature

should
be
adapted
to
the
age
and
strength
of
the
bather
the
young

robust
can
safely
endure
cold

that
would
be
of
no
benefit
but
indeed
an
injury
to
those
of
greater
age
or
of
less
vigorous
conditions
of
health
after
taking
a

the
skin
should
be

bathing
in
cold

should
not
be
indulged

not
serious
results
have
ensued
from

state
of
exhaustion
or

a
daily
cold
bath
when
the
body
is
comfortably
warm
is
a
safe
tonic
for
almost
all
persons
during
the
summer
months
and
tends
especially
to
restore
the
appetite
cold
baths
taken
regularly
render
persons
who
are
susceptible
to
colds
much
less
liable
to
them
and
less
likely
to
be
disturbed
by
sudden
changes
of
temperature
persons
suffering
from
heart
disease
or
from
chronic
disease
of
an
important
organ
should
not
indulge
in
frequent
cold
bathing
except
by
medical
advice
owing
to
the
relaxing
nature
of
hot
baths
persons
with
weak
hearts
or
suffering
from
debility
may
faint
while

outdoor
bathing
should
not
be
taken
for
at

an
hour
after
a
full
meal
and
except
for
the
robust
it
is
not
prudent
to
bathe
with
the
stomach
empty
especially
before
breakfast
it
is
a
wise
rule
in
outdoor
or
sea
bathing
to
come
out
of
the
water
as
soon
as
the
glow
of
reaction
is
felt
it
is
often
advisable
not
to
apply
cold
water
very
freely
to
the
head
tepid
or
even
hot
water
is
preferable
especially
by
those
subject
to
severe
mental
strain
but
it
is
often
a
source
of
great
relief
during
mental
strain
to
bathe
the
face
neck
and
chest
freely
at
bedtime
with
cold
water
it
often
proves
efficient
at
night
in
calming
the
sleeplessness
which
results
from
mental
labor
hot
baths
if
taken
at
bedtime
are
often
serviceable
in
preventing
a
threatened
cold
or
cutting
it
short
the
patient
going
immediately
to

with
extra
clothing
and
hot
drinks
the
free
perspiration
induced
helps
to
break
up
the
cold
salt
water
acts
more
as
a
stimulant
to
the
skin
than
fresh
water
bathing
is
refreshing
and
invigorating
for
those
who
are
healthy
but
the
bather
should
come
out
of
the
water
the
moment
there
is
the
slightest
feeling
of
chilliness
the
practice
of
bathing
in
salt
water
more
than
once

unhealthful

bathing
is
beneficial
in
many
ways
for
children
as
their
skin
reacts
well
after
it
in
all
cases
brisk
rubbing
with
a
rough
towel
should
be
had
afterwards

a
the
golden
rule
of
all
bathing
is
that
it
must
never
be
followed
by
a
chill
if
even
a
chilliness
occur
after
bathing
it
must
immediately
be
broken
up
by
some
appropriate
methods
as
lively
exercise
brisk
friction
hot
drinks
and
the
application
of
heat
swimming
is
a
most
valuable
accomplishment
combining
bathing
and
exercise
bathing
of
the
feet
should
never
be
neglected
cleanliness
of
the
hair
is
also
another
matter
requiring
strict
attention
especially
in
children
care
of
the
hair
and
nails
the
hair
brush
should
not
be
too
stiff
as
this
increases
the
tendency
towards
scurfiness
of
the
head
if
however
the
hair
is
brushed
too
long
or
too
hard
the
scalp
is
greatly
stimulated
and
an
increased
production
of
scurf
may
result
if
the
head
be
washed
too
often
with
soap
its
natural
secretion
is
checked
and
the
scalp
becomes
dry
and
scaly
the
various
hair
pomades
are
as
a
rule
undesirable
and
unnecessary
the
nails
should
be
kept
in
proper
condition
else
they
are
not
only
unsightly
but
may
serve
as
carriers
of
germs
of
disease
the
nails
are
often
injured
by
too
much
interference
and
should
never
be
trimmed
to
the
quick
the
upper
surfaces
should
on
no
account
be
scraped
the
is
sufficient
to
cleanse
them
without
impairing
their
smooth
and
polished
surfaces

use
of
clothing
the
chief
use
of
clothing
from
a
hygienic
point
of
view
is
to
assist
in
keeping
the
body
at
a
uniform
temperature
it
also
serves
for
protection
against
injury
and
for
personal
adornment
the
heat
of
the
body
as
we
have
learned
is
normally
about
this
varies
but
slightly
in
health
a
rise
of
temperature
of
more
than
one
degree
is
a
symptom
of
disturbance
the
normal
temperature
does
not
vary
with
the
season
in
summer
it
is
kept
down
by
the
perspiration
and
its
rapid
evaporation
in
winter
it
is
maintained
by
more
active
oxidation
by
extra
clothing
and
by
artificial
heat
the
whole
matter
of
clothing
is
modified
to
a
great
extent
by
climatic
conditions
and
local
environments
which
do
not
come
within
the
scope
of
this
book
material
used
for
clothing
it
is
evident
that
if
clothing
is
to
do
double
duty
in
preventing
the
loss
of
heat
by
radiation
and
in
protecting
us
from
the
hot
rays
of
the
sun
some
material
must
be
used
that
will
allow
the
passage
of
heat
in
either
direction
the
ideal
clothing
should
be
both
a
bad
conductor
and
a
radiator
of
heat
at
the
same
time
it
must
not
interfere
with
the
free
evaporation
of
the
perspiration
otherwise
chills
may
result
from
the
accumulation
of
moisture
on
the
surface
of
the
body
wool
is
a
bad
conductor
and
should
be
worn
next
the
skin
both
in
summer
and
winter
especially
in
variable
climates
it
prevents
better
than
any
other
material
the
loss
of
heat
from
the
body
and
allows
free
ventilation
and
evaporation
its
fibers
are
so
lightly
woven
that
they
make
innumerable
meshes
enclosing
air
which
is
one
of
the
best
of
silk
ranks
next
to
wool
in
warmth
and
porosity
it
is
much
softer
and
less
irritating
than
flannel
or
merino
and
is
very
useful
for
summer
wear
the
practical
objection
to
its
general
use
is
the
expense
fur
ranks
with
wool
as
a
bad
conductor
of
heat
it
does
not
however
like
wool
allow
of
free
evaporation
its
use
in
cold
countries
is
universal
but
in
milder
climates
it
is
not
much
worn
cotton
and
linen
are
good
conductors
of
heat
but
are
not
absorbents
of
moisture
and
should
not
be
worn
next
the
skin
they
are
however
very
durable
and
easily
cleansed
as
an
intermediate
clothing
they
may
be
worn
at
all
seasons
especially
over
wool
or
silk
waterproof
clothing
is
also
useful
as
a
protection
but
should
not
be
worn
a
longer
time
than
necessary
as
it
shuts
in
the
perspiration
and
causes
a
sense
of
great
heat
and
discomfort
the
color
of
clothing
is
of
some
importance
especially
if
exposed
directly
to
the
rays
the
best
reflectors
such
as
white
and
light
gray
clothing
absorb
comparatively
little
heat
and
are
the
coolest
while
black
or
materials
being
poor
reflectors
and
good
absorbents
become
very
warm
suggestions
for
the
use
of
clothing
prudence
and
good
sense
should
guide
us
in
the
spring
in
changing
winter
flannels
or
clothing
for
fabrics
of
lighter
weight
with
the
fickle
climate
in
most
sections
of
this
country
there
are
great
risks
of
severe
colds
pneumonia
and
other
pulmonary
diseases
from
carelessness
or
neglect
in
this
matter
a
change
from
heavy
to
lighter
clothing
should
be
made
first
in
the
outer
garments
the
underclothing
being
changed
very
cautiously
the
two
essentials
of
healthful
clothing
are
cleanliness
and
dryness
to
wear
garments
that
are
daily
being
soiled
by
perspiration
and
other
cutaneous
excretions
is
a
most
uncleanly
and
unhealthful
practice
clothing
especially
woolen
underclothing
should
be
frequently
changed
one
of
the
objections
to
the
use
of
this
clothing
is
that
it
does
not
show
soiling
to
the
same
extent
as
do
cotton
and
linen
infectious
and
contagious
diseases
may
be
conveyed
by
the
clothing
hence
special
care
must
be
taken
that
all
clothing
in
contact
with
sick
people
is
burned
or
properly
disinfected
children
especially
are
susceptible
to
scarlet
fever
diphtheria
and
measles
and
the
greatest
care
must
be
exercised
to
prevent
their
exposure
to
infection
through
the
clothing
we
should
never
sleep
in
a
damp
bed
or
between
damp
sheets
the
vital
powers
are
enfeebled
during
sleep
and
there
is
always
risk
of
pneumonia
or
rheumatism
the
practice
of
sitting
with
wet
feet
and
damp
clothing
is
highly
injurious
to
health
the
surface
of
the
body
thus
chilled
may
be
small
yet
there
is
a
grave
risk
of
serious
if
not
of
fatal
disease
no
harm
may
be
done
even
with
clothing
wet
with
water
or
damp
with
perspiration
so
long
as
exercise
is
maintained
but
the
failure
or
inability
to
change
into
dry
garments
as
soon
as
the
body
is
at
rest
is
fraught
with
danger
woolen
comforters
scarfs
and
fur
mufflers
so
commonly
worn
around
the
neck
are
more
likely
to
produce
throat
troubles
and
local
chill
than
to
have
any
useful
effect
harm
ensues
from
the
fact
that
the
extra
covering
induces
local
perspiration
which
enfeebles
the
natural
defensive
power
of
the
parts
and
when
the
warmer
covering
is
removed
the
perspiring
surface
is
readily
chilled
those
who
never
bundle
their
throats
are
least
liable
to
suffer
from
throat
ailments
ill
effects
of
wearing
tightly
fitting
clothing
the
injury
to
health
caused
by
tight
lacing
when
carried
to
an
extreme
is
due
to
the
compression
and
displacement
of
various
organs
by
the
pressure
exerted
on
them
thus
the
lungs
and
the
heart
may
be
compressed
causing
short
breath
on
exertion
palpitation
of
the
heart
and
other
painful
and
dangerous
symptoms
the
stomach
the
liver
and
other
abdominal
organs
are
often
displaced
causing
dyspepsia
and
all
its
attendant
evils
the
improper
use
of
corsets
especially
by
young
women
is
injurious
as
they
interfere
with
the
proper
development
of
the
chest
and
abdominal
organs
the
use
of
tight
elastics
below
the
knee
is
often
injurious
they
obstruct
the
local
venous
circulation
and
are
a
fruitful
source
of
cold
feet
and
of
enlarged
or
varicose
veins
tightly
fitting
boots
and
shoes
often
cause
corns
bunions
and
ingrowing
nails
on
the
other
hand
if
too
loosely
worn
they
cause
corns
from
friction
boots
too
narrow
in
front
crowd
the
toes
together
make
them
overlap
and
render
walking
difficult
and
painful
boots
throw
the
weight
of
the
body
forwards
so
that
the
body
rests
too
much
on
the
toes
instead
of
on
the
heels
as
it
should
thus
placing
an
undue
strain
upon
certain
groups
of
muscles
of
the
leg
in
order
to
maintain
the
balance
while
other
groups
are
not
sufficiently
exercised
locomotion
is
never
easy
and
graceful
and
a
firm
even
tread
can
not
be
expected
the
compression
of
the
scalp
by
a
hat
interferes
with
the
local
circulation
and
may
cause
headaches
neuralgia
or
baldness
the
nutrition
of
the
being
diminished
by
the
impaired
circulation
the
compression
of
the
chest
and
abdomen
by
a
tight
belt
and
various
binders
interferes
with
the
action
of
the
diaphragm
most
important
muscle
of

miscellaneous
hints

the
use
of

children
and
old
people
are
less
able
to
resist
the
extreme
changes
of
temperature
than
are
adults
of
an
average
age
special
care
should
be
taken
to
provide
children
with
woolen
underclothing
and
to
keep
them
warm
and
in
rooms
neither
the
chest
nor
limbs
of
young
children
should
be
unduly
exposed
as
is
often
done
to
the
cold
blasts
of
winter
or
the
fickle
weather
of
early
spring
very
young
children
should
not
be
taken
out
in
extremely
cold
weather
unless
quite
warmly
clad
and
able
to
run
about
the
absurd
notion
is
often
entertained
that
children
should
be
hardened
by
exposure
to
the
cold
judicious
means
ample
exposure
of
and
children
exposure
of
children
not
thus
cared
for
is
simple
cruelty
the
many
sicknesses
of
children
especially
diseases
of
the
throat
and
lungs
may
often
be
traced
directly
to
gross
carelessness
ignorance
or
neglect
with
reference
to
undue
exposure
the
delicate
feet
of
children
should
not
be
injured
by
wearing
or
clumsy
boots
or
shoes
many
deformities
of
the
feet
which
cause
much
vexation
and
trouble
in
after
years
are
acquired
in

life
no
one
should
sleep
in
any
of
the
clothes
worn
during
the
day
not
even
in
the

these
precautions
often
results
in

we
must
not

they
must
not

the
cheaper

have
been
known
to
produce

how

modified
the
action
of
the

is
subject
to
very
marked
and
sudden
modifications
especially
those
operating
through
the
nervous
system
thus
whatever
raises
the

capillaries
of
the
capsules
will
increase
the
quantity
of
fluid
filtering
through
them
that
is
the
watery
portion
of
the
secretion
will
be
increased
without
necessarily
adding
to
its
solids
so
anything
which
lowers
the

diminish
the
watery
portion
of
the
secretion
that
is
the
secretion
will
be
scanty
but
concentrated
the
renal
function
of
the
kidneys
is
to
secrete
a
fluid
commonly
known
as
the
urine
the
average
quantity
passed
in
hours
by
an
adult
varies
from
to
fluid
ounces
normal
urine
consists
of
about
per
cent
of
water
and
per
cent
of
solids
the
latter
consist
chiefly
of
certain
nitrogenous
substances
known
as
urea
and
uric
acid
a
considerable
quantity
of
mineral
salts
and
some
coloring
matter
urea
the
most
important
and
most
abundant
constituent
of
urine
contains
the
four
elements
but
nitrogen
forms
its
weight
while
therefore
the
lungs
expel
carbon
dioxid
chiefly
the
kidneys
expel
nitrogen
both
of
these
substances
express
the
result
of
oxidations
going

the

acids
represent
the

the
type

can
keep

or
we

this
vital
fact
is
the
key
to
the
injurious
results
developed
in
the

by
the
use

these
two
organs
have

amounts
of
blood
to

from

and
they
feel
very
quickly
the
presence
of

excite
and
irritate
the
delicate
renal
membranes
and
speedily
disturb
and
eventually
destroy
their
capacity
to
excrete
the
proper
materials
from
the
blood
the
continued
congestion
of
the
minute
structure
of
the
kidney
cuts
off
the

of
the

and
forms
the
primary

in

sometimes
from

then
with
this

alcoholic

the

one
of

is
the

it

thus
far
we
have
learned
something
of
the
various
organs
and
the
manner
in
which
they
do
their
work
regarding
our
bodily
structure
as
a
kind
of
living
machine
we
have
studied
its
various
parts
and
found
that
each
is
designed
to
perform
some
special
work
essential
to
the
of
the
whole
as
yet
we
have
learned
of
no
means
by
which
these
organs
are
enabled
to
adjust
their
activities
to
the
needs
of
other
tissues
and
other
organs
we
are
now
prepared
to
study
a

wonderful
and
complex
agency
nervous
system
the
master
tissue
which
controls
regulates
and
directs
every
other
tissue
of
the
human
body
the
nervous
system
in
its
properties
and
mode
of
action
is
distinct
from
all
the
other
systems
and
organs
and
it
shares
with
no
other
organ
or
tissue
the
power
to
do
its
special
work
it
is
the
medium
through
which
all
impressions
are
received
it
connects
all
the
parts
of
the
body
into
an
organism
in
which
each
acts
in
harmony
with
every
other
part
for
the
good
of
the
whole
it
animates
and
governs
all
movements
voluntary
or
involuntary
excretion
nutrition
in
fact
all
the
processes
of
organic
life
are
subject
to
its
regulating
power
the
different
organs
of
the
body
are
united
by
a
common
sympathy
which
regulates
their
action
this
harmonious
result
is
secured
by
means
of
the
nervous
system
this
system
in
certain
of
its
parts
receives
impressions
and
generates
a
force
peculiar
to
itself
we
shall
learn
that
there
can
be
no
physical
communication
between
or
coördination
of
the
various
parts
of
organs
or

without

as
in
ordinary

or
special
impressions
as
in

every
act
of

and
every
thought
are
possible
only
through
the
action
of
the
nerve
centers
nerve
cells
however
complicated
the
structure
of
nerve
tissue
in
man
seems
to
be
it
is
found
to
consist
of
only
two
different
elements
nerve
cells
and
nerve
fibers
these
are
associated
and
combined
in
many
ways
they
are
arranged
in
distinct
masses
called
nerve
centers
or
in
the
form
of
cords
known
as
nerves
the
former
are
made
up
of
nerve
fibers

many
the
various
kinds
of
nerve

differ
much
in
the

of

one
of
the
processes
is
a

with
at

each
part
of
this
system
has
its
own
characteristic
cell
thus
we
have
in
the
spinal
cord
the
large
irregular
cells
with
many
processes
and
in
the
brain
proper
the
cells
with
a
process
jutting
out
from
each
corner
so
characteristic
are
these
forms
of
cells
that
any
particular
part
of
nerve
structure
may
be
identified
by
the
kind
of
cells
seen
under
the
microscope
nerve
cells
and
nerve
fibers
are
often
arranged
in
groups
the

continuous
throughout
the
whole

of
the

called
the

this
core
is
surrounded
by
the

its

in
branches
from
the
sympathetic
ganglia
though
found
to
some
extent
in
the
nerves
of
the
system
in
a
general
way
the
nerve
fibers
resemble
an
electric
cable

its
central
rod
of
copper

its
outer
layer

the

thus
the

nourishment
but
also
supplies
new
material
as

we

in
men
and

highly
organized

nerves
are
found
in
nearly
every
tissue
and
organ
of
the
body
they
penetrate
the
most
minute
muscular
fibers
they
are
closely
connected
with
the

among
the
chief
factors
of

sense
organs

thus
the
nervous
system
is
the
system
of
organs
through
the
functions
of
which
we
are
brought
into
relation
with
the
world
around
us

we
hear

help
us
the
better
to
understand
the
complicated

of
the
nervous
system
if
we
compare
it
to
a
telegraph
line
the
brain
is
the
main
office
and
the
multitudes
of
nerve
fibers
branching
off
to
all
parts
of
the
body
are
the
wires
by
means
of
these
nerve
messages
are
constantly
being
sent
to
the
brain
to
inform
it
of
what
is
going
on
in
various
parts
of
the
body
and
asking
what
is
to
be
done
in
each
case
the
brain
on
receiving
the
intelligence
at
once
sends
back
the
required
instructions
countless
messages
are
sent
to
and
fro
with
unerring
accuracy
and
marvelous
rapidity
thus
when
we
accidentally
pick
up
something
hot
it
is
instantly
dropped
a
nerve
impulse
passes
from
the
nerves
of
touch
in
the
fingers
to
the
brain
which
at
once
hurries
off
its
order
along
another
set
of
nerves

hand

drop
the
burning
object
these
examples
so
common
in
daily
life
may
be
multiplied
to
any
extent
almost
every
voluntary
act
we
perform
is
executed
under
the
direction
of
the
nervous
system
although
the
time
occupied
is
so
small
that
it
is
beyond
our
power

estimate
it

which

divisions
of
the
nervous
system
this
system
in
man
consists
of
two
great
divisions
the
first
is
the
great
nerve
center
of
the
body
the
system
which
rules
the
organs
of
animal
life
this
includes
the
brain
the
spinal
cord
and
the
nerves
nerves
are
given
off
from
the
brain
and
the
cord
and
form
the
mediums
of
communication
between
the
external
parts
of
the
body
the
muscles
or
the
sense
organs
and
the
brain
the
second
part
is
the
sympathetic
system
which
regulates
the
organic
life
this
consists
of
numerous
small
nerve
centers
arranged
in
oval
masses
varying
greatly
in
size
called
ganglia
or
knots
these
are
either
scattered
irregularly
through
the
body
or
arranged
in
a
double
chain
of
knots
lying
on
the
front
of
the
spine
within
the
chest
and
abdomen
from
this
chain
large
numbers
of
nerves
are
given
off
which
end
chiefly
in
the
organs
of
digestion
circulation
and
respiration
the
sympathetic
system
serves
to
bring
all
portions
of
the
animal
economy
into
direct
sympathy
with
one
another
the
brain
as
a
whole
the
brain
is
the
seat
of
the
intellect
the
will
the
affections
the
emotions
the
memory
and
sensation
it
has
also
many
other
and
complex
functions
in
it
are
established
many
reflex
automatic
and
coordinating
centers
which
are
as
independent
of
consciousness
as
are
those
of
the
spinal

the
brain
is
the
largest
and
most
complex
mass
of
nerve
tissue
in
the
body
made
up
of
an
enormous
collection
of
gray
cells
and
nerve
fibers
this
organ
consists
of
a
vast
number
of
distinct
ganglia
or
separate
masses
of
nerve
matter
each
capable
of
performing
separate
functions
but
united
through
the
cerebral
action
into
a
harmonious
whole

the
average
weight
of
the
adult
human
brain
is
about
ounces
for
men
and
ounces
for
women
other
things
being
equal
the
size
and
weight
of
the
brain
bear
a
general
relation
to
the
mental
power
of
the
individual
as
a
rule
a
large
healthy
brain
stands
for
a
vigorous
and
superior
intellect
the
brains
of
many
eminent
men
have
been
found
to
be
to
ounces
above
the
average
weight
but
there
are
notable
exceptions
the
brains
of
idiots
are
small
indeed
any
weight
under
a
certain
size
about
ounces
seems
to
be
invariably
associated
with
an
imbecile
mind
the
human
brain
is
absolutely
heavier
than
that
of
any
other
animal
except
the
whale
and
elephant
comparing
the
size
of
these
animals
with
that
of
man
it
is
instructive
to
notice
how
much
larger
in
proportion
to
the
body
is
brain
the
average
proportion
of
the
weight
of
the
brain
to
the
weight
of
the
body
is
greater
in
man
than
in
most
animals
being
about
to
in
some
small
birds
in
the
smaller
monkeys
and
in
some
rodents
the
proportional
weight
of
the
brain
to
that
of
the
body
is
even
greater
than
in
man
the
cerebrum
the
three
principal
masses
which
make
up
the
brain
when
viewed
as
a
whole
are
the
cerebrum
or
brain
proper
the
cerebellum
or
lesser
brain
the
medulla
oblongata
the
cerebrum
comprises
nearly
of
the
entire
mass
and
fills
the
upper
part
of
the
skull
it
consists
of
two
halves
the
right
and
left
cerebral
hemispheres
these
are
almost
separated
from
each
other
by
a
deep
median
fissure
the
hemispheres
are
united
at
the
bottom
of
the
fissure
by
a
mass
of
white
fibers
passing
from
side
to
side
each
of
these
hemispheres
is
subdivided
into
three
lobes
so
that
the
entire
cerebrum
is
made
up
of
six
distinct
lobes
the
cerebrum
has
a
peculiar
convoluted
appearance
its
deep
folds
being
separated
by
fissures
some
of
them
nearly
an
inch
in
depth
it
is
composed
of
both
white
and
gray
matter
the
former
comprises
the
greater
part
of
the
mass
while
the
latter
is
spread
over
the
surface
in
a
layer
of
about
of
an
inch
thick
the
gray
matter
is
the
portion
having
the
highest
functions
and
its
apparent
quantity
is
largely
increased
by
being
formed
in
convolutions
the
convolutions
of
the
cerebrum
are
without
doubt
associated
with
all
those
higher
actions
which
distinguish
life
but
all
the
convolutions
are
not
of
equal
importance
thus
it
is
probable
that
only
the
frontal
part
of
the
brain
is
the
intellectual
region
while
certain
convolutions
are
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
senses
the
cerebrum
is
the
chief
seat
of
the
sensations
the
intellect
the
will
and
the
emotions
a
study
of
cerebral
injuries
and
diseases
and
experiments
upon
the
lower
animals
prove
that
the
hemispheres
and
more
especially
the
gray
matter
are
connected
with
mental
states
the
convolutions
in
the
human
brain
are
more
prominent
than
in
that
of
the
higher
animals
most
nearly
allied
to
man
although
some
species
of
animals
not
especially
intelligent
have
marked
cerebral
convolutions
the
higher
races
of
men
have
more
marked
convolutions
than
those
less
civilized

a
portion
of
the

in
some
animals
as

the

other
parts
of
the
nervous
system
by
strands
of
white
matter
on
each
side
radiating
from
the
center
and
divided
into
numerous
branches
around
these
branches
the
gray

is
arranged
in
a
beautiful
manner
suggesting
the
leaves
of

hence
its
name
arbor

the
functions
of
the
cerebellum
are
not
certainly
known
it
appears
to
influence
the
muscles
of
the
body
so
as
to
regulate
their
movements
that
is
it

to
bring
the
various
muscular

the
mechanism
by
which
it
does
this
has
not
yet
been
clearly
explained
in
an
animal

which
the
cerebellum

the
cranial

nerves
consist
of
twelve
pairs
of
nerves
which
pass
from
the
brain
through
different
openings
in
the
base
of
the
skull
and
are
distributed
over
the
head
and
face
also
to
some
parts
of
the
trunk
and
certain
internal
organs
these
nerves
proceed
in
pairs
from
the
corresponding
parts
of
each
side
of
the
brain
chiefly
to
the
organs
of
smell
taste
hearing

the
cranial

are
of
three
kinds
sensory
motor
and
both
combined

the
cranial

which
pass
down
through

ethmoid
bone
into
the
nasal
cavities
and
are
spread
over
the
inner
surface
of
the
nose
they
are
sensory
and
are
the
special

run
down
to
the
base
of
the
brain
from
which
an
optic
nerve
passes
to

eyeball
these
are
sensory
nerves
and
are
devoted
to
sight
the
third
fourth
and
sixth
pairs
proceed
to
the
muscles
of
the
eyes
and
control
their

these
are
motor
nerves
the

in
three
branches
and
proceeds
mainly
to
the

are
called
and
are
mixed
nerves
partly
sensory
and
partly
motor
the
first
branch
is
purely
sensory
and
gives
sensibility
to
the
eyeball
the
second
gives
sensibility
to
the
nose
gums
and
cheeks
the
third
mixed
gives
the

the
facial
proceed
to

face
where
they
spread

the
eighth
pair
are
the
auditory

nerves
of
hearing
and
are
distributed
to
the
special
organs

more
convenient
to
consider
them
separately
the
ninth

are
partly
sensory

each
nerve
contains
two
roots
one
a
nerve
of
taste
which
spreads
over

the
functions
of
the
spinal
nerves
the
messages
which
pass
along
the
spinal
nerves
to
and
from
the
brain
are
transmitted
mostly
through
the
gray
matter
of
the
cord
but
some
pass
along
the
white
matter
on
the
outer
part
as
in
the
brain
however
all
the
active
powers
of
the
cord
are
confined
to
the
gray
matter
the
spinal
nerves
themselves
have
nothing
to
do
with
sensation
or
will
they
are
merely
conductors
to
carry
messages
to
and
fro
they
neither
issue
commands
nor
feel
a
sensation
hence
they
consist
entirely
of
white
matter
functions
of
the
spinal
cord
the
spinal
cord
is
the
principal
channel
through
which
all
impulses
from
the
trunk
and
extremities
pass
to
the
brain
and
all
impulses
to
the
trunk
and
extremities
pass
from
the
brain
that
is
the
spinal
cord
receives
from
various
parts
of
the
body
by
means
of
its
sensory
nerves
certain
impressions
and
conveys
them
to
the
brain
where
they
are
interpreted
the
cord
also
transmits
by
means
of
its
motor
nerves
the
commands
of
the
brain
to
the
voluntary
muscles
and
so
causes
movement
thus
when
the
cord
is
divided
at
any
point
compressed
as
by
a
tumor
or
broken
bone
or
disorganized
by
disease
the
result
is
a
complete
loss
of
sensation
and
voluntary
movement
below
the
point
of
injury
if
by
accident
a
man
has
his
spinal
cord
injured
at
some
point
he
finds
he
has
lost
all
sensation
and
power
of
motion
below
that
spot
the
impulse
to
movement
started
in
his
brain
by
the
will
does
not
reach
the
muscles
he
wishes
to
move
because
traveling
the
spinal
cord
it
can
not
pass
the
seat
of
injury
so
the
impression
produced
by
pricking
the
leg
with
a
pin
which
before
pain
can
be
felt
must
travel
up
the
spinal
cord
to
the
brain
can
not
reach
the
brain
because
the
injury
obstructs
the
path
the
telegraph
wire
has
been
cut
and
the
current
can
no
longer
pass
the
spinal
cord
as
a
conductor
of
impulses
the
identity
in
structure
of
the
spinal
nerves
whether
motor
or
sensory
and
the
vast
number
of
nerves
in
the
cord
make
it
impossible
to
trace
for
any
distance
with
the
eye
even
aided
by
the
microscope
and
the
most
skillful
dissection
the
course
of
nerve
fibers
the
paths
by
which
the
motor
impulses
travel
down
the
cord
are
fairly
well
known
these
impulses
originate
in
the
brain
and
passing
down
keep
to
the
same
side
of
the
cord
and
go
out
by
nerves
to
the
same
side
of
the
body
the
sensory
impulses
however
soon
after
they
enter
the
cord
by
the
nerve
of
one
side
cross
in
the
cord
to
the
opposite
side
up
which
they
travel
to
the
brain
thus
the
destruction
of
one
lateral
half
of
the
cord
causes
paralysis
of
motion
on
the
as
the
injury
but
loss
of
sensation
on
the
because
the
posterior
portion
destroyed
consists
of
fibers
which
have
crossed
from
the
opposite
side
experiment
proves
that
if
both
roots
of
a
spinal
nerve
be
cut
all
those
parts
of
the
body
to
which
they
send
branches
become
paralyzed
and
have
neither
sense
of
pain
nor
power
of
voluntary
movement
the
parts
might
even
be
cut
or
burned
without
pain
it
is
precisely
like
cutting
a
telegraph
wire
and
stopping

that

all

is
lost

all

in

supplied

is

remains
from

and

it
is
evident
that
those

of

which
are
derived

root
are
motor
and
those
from
the
posterior
root
sensory
fibers
impulses
sent

to
muscles
will
therefore
pass

those

of
the
nerves
which
are
derived
from
these
motor
roots
on

impressions
or
sensations
passing

will
enter
the
spinal

and
reach
the
brain
through
the

or
sensory
roots
the
spinal
cord
as
a
reflex
center
besides
this
function
of
the
spinal
cord
as
a
great
nerve
conductor
to
carry
sensations
to
the
brain
and
bring
back
its
orders
it
is
also
an
independent
center
for
what
is
called
reflex
action
by
means
of
its
sensory
nerves
it
receives
impressions
from
certain
parts
of
the
body
and
on
its
own
authority
sends
back
instructions
to
the
muscles
by
its
motor
nerves
without
consulting
the
brain
this
constitutes
reflex
action
so
called
because
the
impulse
sent
to
the
spinal
cord
by
certain
sensory
nerves
is
at
once
reflected
or
sent
back
as
a
motor
impulse
to
the
muscles
this
reflex
action
is
a
most
important
function
of
the
spinal
cord
this
power
is
possessed
only
by
the
gray
matter
of
the
cord
the
white
substance
being
simply
a
conductor
the
cells
of
gray
matter
are
found
all
along
the
cord
but
are
grouped
together
in
certain
parts
notably
in
the
cervical
and
lumbar
regions
the
cells
of
the
anterior
horns
are
in
relation
with
the
muscles
by
means
of
nerve
fibers
and
are
also
brought
into
connection
with
the
skin
and
other
sensory
surfaces
by
means
of
nerve
fibers
running
in
the
posterior
part
of
the
cord
thus
there
is
established
in
the
spinal
cord
without
reference
to
the
brain
at
all
a
reflex
mechanism
reflex
centers
for
the
purpose
of
illustration
we
might
consider
the
body
as
made
up
of
so
many
segments
piled
one
on
another
each
segment
presided
over
by
a
similar
segment
of
spinal
cord
each
bodily
segment
would
have
sensory
and
motor
nerves
corresponding
to
its
connection
with
the
spinal
cord
the
group
of
cells
in
each
spinal
segment
is
intimately
connected
with
the
cells
of
the
segments
above
and
below
thus
an
impression
reaching
the
cells
of
one
spinal
segment
might
be
so
strong
as
to
overflow
into
the
cells
of
other
segments
and
thus
cause
other
parts
of
the
body
to
be
affected
take
as
an
example
the
case
of
a
child
who
has
eaten
improper
food
which
irritates
its
bowels
sensory
nerves
of
the
bowels
are
disturbed
and
powerful
impressions
are
carried
up
to
a
center
in
the
spinal
cord
these
impressions
may
now
overflow
into
other
centers
from
which
spasmodic
discharges
of
nerve
energy
may
be
liberated
which
passing
to
the
muscles
throw
them
into
violent
and
spasmodic
contraction
in
other
words
the
child
has
a
fit
or
convulsion
all
this
disturbance
being
the
result
of
reflex
action
the
spasmodic
motions
being
quite
involuntary
as
the
brain
takes
no
part
in
them
the
child
meanwhile
is
of
course
entirely
unconscious
and
however
it
may
seem
to
be
distressed
really
suffers
no
pain
scattered
along
the
entire
length
of
the
spinal
cord
especially
in
the
upper
part
are
groups
of
nerve
cells
which
preside
over
certain
specific
functions
of
animal
life
that
is
definite
collections
of
cells
which
control
definite
functions
thus
there
are
certain
centers
for
maintaining
the
action
of
the
heart
and
the
movements
of
breathing
and
low
down
in
the
cord
in
the
lumbar
regions
are
centers
for
the
control
of
the
various
abdominal
organs
numerous
other
reflex
centers
are
described
by
physiologists
but
enough
has
been
said
to
emphasize
the
great
importance
of
the
spinal
cord
as
an
independent
nerve
center
besides
its
function
as
a
conductor
of
nervous
impulses
to
and
from
the
brain
the
brain
as
a
reflex
center
the
brain
as
we
have
just
stated
is
the
seat
of
consciousness
and
intelligence
it
is
also
the
seat
of
many
reflex
automatic
and
coordinating
centers
these
give
rise
to
certain
reflex
actions
which
are
as
entirely
independent
of
consciousness
as
are
those
of
the
spinal
cord
these
acts
take
place
independently
of
the
will
and
often
without
the
consciousness
of
the
individual
thus
a
sudden
flash
of
light
causes
the
eyes
to
blink
as
the
result
of
reflex
action
the
optic
nerves
serve
as
the
sensory
and
the
facial
nerves
as
the
motor
conductors
the
sudden
start
of
the
whole
body
at
some
loud
noise
the
instinctive
dodging
a
threatened
blow
and
the
springing
back
from
sudden
danger
are
the
results
of
reflex
action
the
result
ensues
in
these
and
in
many
other
instances
without
the
consciousness
of
the
individual
and
indeed
beyond
his
power
of
control
the
importance
of
reflex
action
reflex
action
is
thus
a
marvelous
provision
of
nature
for
our
comfort
health
and
safety
its
vast
influence
is
not
realized
as
its
numberless
acts
are
so
continually
going
on
without
our
knowledge
in
fact
the
greater
part
of
nerve
power
is
expended
to
produce
reflex
action
the
brain
is
thus
relieved
of
a
vast
amount
of
work
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
brain
to
serve
as
a
to
control
every
act
of
our
daily
life
if
we
had
to
plan
and
to
will
every
or
every
respiration
the
struggle
for
life
would
soon
be
given
up
the
fact
that
the
gray
cells
of
the
spinal
cord
can
originate
a
countless
number
of
reflex
and
automatic
activities
is
not
only
of
great
importance
in
protecting
the
body
from
injury
but
increases
vastly
the
range
of
the
activities
of
our
daily
life
even
walking
riding
the
bicycle
playing
on
a
piano
and
numberless
other
such
acts
may
be
reflex
movements
to
learn
how
requires
of
course
the
action
of
the
brain
but
with
frequent
repetition
the
muscles
become
so
accustomed
to
certain
successive
movements
that
they
are
continued
by
the
cord
without
the
control
of
the
brain
thus
we
may
acquire
a
sort
of
artificial
reflex
action
which
in
time
becomes
in
a
way
a
part
of
our
organization
and
is
carried
on
without
will
power
or
even
consciousness
so
while
the
hands
are
busily
doing
one
thing
the
brain
can
be
intently
thinking
of
another
in
fact
any
attempt
to
control
reflex
action
is
more
apt
to
hinder
than
to
help
in
coming
rapidly
down
stairs
the
descent
will
be
made
with
ease
and
safety
if
the
spinal
cord
is
allowed
entire
charge
of
the
act
but
the
chances
of
stumbling
or
of
tripping
are
very
much
increased
if
each
step
be
taken
as
the
result
of
the
will
power
the
reflex
action
of
the
cord
may
be
diminished
or
inhibited
as
it
is
called
but
this
power
is
limited
thus
we
can
by
an
effort
of
the
will
stop
breathing
for
a
certain
time
but
beyond
that
the
reflex
mechanism
overcomes
our
will
and
we
could
not
if
we
would
commit
suicide
by
holding
our
breath
when
we
are
asleep
if
the
palm
of
the
hand
be
tickled
it
closes
when
we
are
awake
we
can
prevent

hence
all
these

of
the

mentioned
that
are
necessary
to
the
maintenance
of
the
animal
life
and
of
the
harmony
which
must
exist
between
them
are
controlled
by
the
sympathetic
system
but
for
this
control
the
heart
would
stop
beating
during
sleep
digestion
would
cease
and
breathing
would
be
suspended
gentle
irritation
of
these
nerves
induced
by
contact
of
food
in
the
stomach
causes
that
organ
to
begin
the

various
mental
emotions
also
have
a
reflex
action
upon
the
sympathetic
system
thus
terror
dilates
the
pupils
fear
acts
upon
the
nerves
of
the
small
of
the
face
to
produce
pallor
and
the
sight
of
an
accident
or
even
the
emotions
produced
by
hearing
of
one
may
excite
nausea
and
vomiting
the
control
of
the
as
has
been
stated
sec
is
one
of
the
special
functions
of
the
sympathetic
system
through
the
nerves
distributed
to
the
muscular
coats
of
the
arteries
the
caliber
of
these
vessels
can
be
varied
so
that
at
one
moment
they
permit
a
large
quantity
of
blood
to
pass
and
at
another
will
contract
so
as
to
diminish
the
supply
this
too
is
beyond
the
control
of
the
will
and
is
brought
about
by
the
nerves
of
the
sympathetic
system
through
a
reflex
arrangement
the
center
for
which
is
the
medulla
oblongata
need
of
rest
the
life
of
the
body
as
has
been
emphasized
in
the
preceding
chapters
is
subject
to
constant
waste
going
on
every
moment
from
the
first
breath
of
infancy
to
the
last
hour
of
old
age
we
should
speedily
exhaust
our
life
from
this
continual
loss
but
for
its
constant
renewal
with
fresh
material
this
exhaustion
of
life
is
increased
by
exertion
and
the
process
of
repair
is
vastly
promoted
by
rest
thus
while
exercise
is
a
duty
rest
is
equally
imperative
the
eye
when
exactingly
used
in
fine
work
should
have
frequent
intervals
of
rest
in
a
few
moments
of
darkness
by
closing
the
lids
the
brain
when
urged
by
strenuous
study
should
have
occasional
seasons
of
rest
by
a
dash
of
cold
water
upon
the
forehead
and
a
brief
walk
with
slow
and
deep
inspirations
of
fresh
air
the
muscles
long
cramped
in
a
painful
attitude
should
be
rested
as
often
as
may
be
by
change
of
posture
or
by
a
few
steps
around
the
room
it
is
not
entirely
the
amount
of
work
done
but
the
continuity
of
strain
that
wears
upon
the
body
even
a
brief
rest
interrupts
this
strain
it
unclogs
the
wheels
of
action
our
bodies
are
not
designed
for
continuous
toil
an
alternation
of
labor
and
rest
diminishes
the
waste
of
life
the
benign
process
of
repair
can
not
go
on
to
any
extent
during
strenuous
labor
but
by
interposing
frequent
though
brief
periods
of
rest
we
lessen
the
amount
of
exhaustion
refresh
the
jaded
nerves
and
the
remaining
labor
is
more
easily
endured
benefits
of
rest
there
is
too
little
repose
in
our
american
nature
and
in
our
modes
of
life
a
sense
of
fatigue
is
the
mute
appeal
of
the
body
for
a
brief
respite
from
labor
and
the
appeal
should
if
possible
be
heeded
if
this
appeal
be
not
met
the
future
exertion
exhausts
far
more
than
if
the
body
had
been
even
slightly
refreshed
if
the
appeal
be
met
the
brief
rest
eases
the
friction
of
toil
and
the
remaining
labor
is
more
easily
borne
the
feeling
that
a
rest
is
so
much
time
lost
is
quite
an
error
it
is
a
gain
of
physical
strength
of
mental
vigor
and
of
the
total
amount
of
work
done
the
merchant
burdened
with
the
cares
of
business
life
the
soldier
on
the
long
march
the
ambitious
student
to
win
success
in
his
studies
the
housewife
wearied
with
her
many
hours
of
exacting
toil
each
would
make
the
task
lighter
and
would
get
through
it
with
less
loss
of
vital
force
by
occasionally
devoting
a
few
minutes
to
absolute
rest
in
entire
relaxation
of
the
strained
muscles
and
overtaxed
nerves
the
sabbath
as
a
day
of
physiological
rest
the
divine
institution
of
a
sabbath
of
rest
one
day
in
seven
is
based
upon
the
highest
needs
of
our
nature
rest
to
be
most
effective
should
alternate
in
brief
periods
with
labor
it
is
sound
physiology
as
well
as
good
morals
and
manners
to
cease
from
the
usual
routine
of
six
days
of
mental
or
physical
work
and
rest
both
the
mind
and
the
body
on
the
seventh
those
who
have
succeeded
best
in
what
they
have
undertaken
and
who
have
enjoyed
sound
health
during
a
long
and
useful
life
have
studiously
lived
up
to
the
mandates
of
this
great
physiological
law
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
the
tendency
nowadays
to
devote
the
sabbath
to
long
trips
on
the
bicycle
tiresome
excursions
by
land
and
sea
and
generally
affords
that
real
rest
from
a
physiological
point
of
view
which
nature
demands
after
six
days
of
manual
or
mental
labor
the
significance
of
sleep
as
a
periodical
rest
of
the
chief
characteristics
of
all
living
beings
none
is
so
significant
as
their
periodicity
plants
as
well
as
animals
exhibit
this
periodic
character
thus
plants
have
their
annual
as
well
as
daily
periods
of
activity
and
inactivity
hibernating
animals
pass
the
winter
in
a
condition
of
unconsciousness
only
to
have
their
functions
of
activity
restored
in
early
spring
human
beings
also
present
many
instances
of
a
periodic
character
many
of
which
have
been
mentioned
in
the
preceding
pages
thus
we
have
learned
that
the
heart
has
its
regular
alternating
periods
of
work
and
rest
after
every
expiration
from
the
lungs
there
is
a
pause
before
the
next
inspiration
begins
now
sleep
is
just
another
manifestation
of
this
periodic
and
physiological
rest
by
which
nature
refreshes
us
it
is
during
the
periods
of
sleep
that
the
energy
expended
in
the
activities
of
the
waking
hours
is
mainly
renewed
in
our
waking
moments
the
mind
is
kept
incessantly
active
by
the
demands
made
on
it
through
the
senses
there
is
a
expenditure
of
energy
and
a
consequent
waste
which
must
be
repaired
a
time
soon
comes
when
the
brain
cells
fail
to
respond
to
the
demand
and
sleep
must
supervene
however
resolutely
we
may
resist
this
demand
nature
in
her
relentless
way
puts
us
to
sleep
no
matter
what
objects
are
brought
before
the
mind
with
a
view
to
retain
its
attention
effect
of
sleep
upon
the
bodily
functions
in
all
the
higher
animals
the
central
nervous
system
enters
once
at
least
in
the
hours
into
the
condition
of
rest
which
we
call
sleep
inasmuch
as
the
most
important
modifications
of
this
function
are
observed
in
connection
with
the
system
a
brief
consideration
of
the
subject
is
properly
studied
in
this
chapter
in
chapter
iv
we
learned
that
repose
was
as
necessary
as
exercise
to
maintain
muscular
vigor
so
after
prolonged
mental
exertion
or
in
fact
any
effort
which
involves
an
expenditure
of
what
is
often
called
sleep
becomes
a
necessity
the
need
of
such
a
rest
is
and
the
loss
of
it
is
a
common
cause
of
the
impairment
of
health
while
we
are
awake
and
active
the
waste
of
the
body
exceeds
the
repair
but
when
asleep
the
waste
is
diminished
and
the
cells
are
more
actively
rebuilding
the
structure
for
labor
the
organic
functions
such
as
are
under
the
direct
control
of
the
sympathetic
nervous
system
respiration
and
digestion
diminished
in
activity
during
sleep
the
pulsations
of
the
heart
and
the
respiratory
movements
are
less
frequent
and
the
circulation
is
slower
the
bodily
temperature
is
reduced
and
the
cerebral
circulation
is
diminished
the
eyes
are
turned
upward
and
inward
and
the
pupils
are
contracted
the
senses
do
not
all
fall
to
sleep
at
once
but
drop
off
successively
first
the
sight
then
the
smell
the
taste
the
hearing
and
lastly
the
touch
the
sleep
ended
they
awake
in
an
inverse
order

and

the
amount
of
sleep
required
no
precise
rule
can
be
laid
down
concerning
the
amount
of
sleep
required
it
varies
with
age
occupation
temperament
and
climate
to
a
certain
extent
an
infant
whose
main
business
it
is
to
grow
spends
the
greater
part
of
its
time
in
sound
sleep
adults
of
average
age
who
work
hard
with
their
hands
or
brain
under
perfectly
normal
physiological
conditions
usually
require
at
least
eight
hours
of
sleep
some
need
less
but
few
require
more
personal
peculiarities
and
perhaps
habit
to
a
great
extent
exert
a
marked
influence
some
of
the
greatest
men
as
napoleon
have
been
very
sparing
sleepers
throughout
his
long
and
active
life
frederick
the
great
never
slept
more
than
five
or
six
hours
in
the
on
the
other
hand
some
of
the
busiest
who
lived
to
old
age
as
william
cullen
bryant
and
henry
ward
beecher
required
and
took
care
to
secure
at
least
eight
or
nine
hours
of
sound
sleep
every
night
in
old
age
less
sleep
is
usually
required
than
in
adult
life
while
the
aged
may
pass
much
of
their
time
in
sleep
in
fact
each
person
learns
by
experience
how
much
sleep
is
necessary
there
is
no
one
thing
which
more
unfits
one
for
prolonged
mental
or
physical
effort
than
the
loss
of
natural
rest
practical
rules
about
sleep
children
should
not
be
played
with
boisterously
just
before
the
bedtime
hour
nor
their
minds
excited
with
weird
goblin
stories
or
a
long
time
may
pass
before
the
eyes
and
agitated
nerves
become
composed
to
slumber
disturbed
or
insufficient
sleep
is
a
potent
factor
towards
producing
a
fretful
irritable
child
at
all
ages
the
last
hour
before
sleep
should
if
possible
be
spent
quietly
to
smooth
the
way
towards
sound
and
refreshing
rest
the
sleep
induced
by
medicine
is
very
often
troubled
and
unsatisfactory
medicines
of
this
sort
should
not
be
taken
except
on
the
advice
of
a
physician
while
a
hearty
meal
should
not
usually
be
taken
just
before
bedtime
it
is
not
well
to
go
to
bed
with
a
sense
of
positive
faintness
and
hunger
rather
one
should
take
a
very
light
lunch
of
quite
simple
food

a
support
for
the
next
eight

and

parts
it
is
better
as
a
rule
not
to
engage
in
severe
study
during
the
hours
just
before
bedtime
neither
body
nor
mind
being
at
its
best
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
study
at
that
time
wears
upon
the
system
more
and
the
progress
is
less
than
at
earlier
hours
one
hour
of
morning
or
day
study
is
worth
a
much
longer
time
late
at
night
it
is
therefore
an
economy
both
of
time
and
of
nerve
force
to
use
the
day
hours
and
the
early
evening
for
study
the
should
never
be
made
to
serve
as
a
substitute
for
a
full
sleep
they
are
largely
a
matter
of
habit
and
are
detrimental
to
some
as
well
as
beneficial
to
others
late
hours
are
usually
associated
with
exposure
excitement
and
various
other
drains
upon
the
nerve
force
and
hence
are
injurious
it
is
better
to
sleep
on
one
or
other
side
than
on
the
back
the
head
should
be
somewhat
raised
and
a
mattress
is
better
than
a
feather
bed
the
bedclothes
should
be
sufficient
but
not
too

tends
to
prevent
sleep
as
do

monotonous

aid

alcohol
and
the

the
unfortunate
effects
which
alcoholic
drinks
produce
upon
the
brain
and
nervous
system
differ
from
the
destructive
results
upon
other
parts
of
the
body
in
this
respect
that
elsewhere
the
consequences
are
usually
both
less
speedy
and
less
obvious
the
stomach
the
liver
and
even
the
heart
may
endure
for
a
while
the
trespass
of
the
narcotic
poison
and
not
betray
the
invasion
but
the
nervous
system
can
not
like
them
suffer
in
silence
in
the
other
parts
of
the
body
the
victim
may
to
a
certain
extent
conceal
from
others
the
suffering
of
which
he
himself
is
painfully
conscious
but
the
tortured
brain
instantly
reveals
the
calamity
and
the
shame
while
the
only
one
who
may
not
fully
realize
it
is
the
victim
himself
besides
this
the
injuries
inflicted
upon
other
organs
affect
only
the
body
but
here
they
drag
down
the
mind
ruin
the
morals
and
destroy
the
character
the
brain
is
indeed
the
most
important
organ
of
the
body
as
it
presides
over
all
the
others
it
is
the
lofty
seat
of
power
and
authority
here
the
king
is
on
his
throne
but
if
by
this
malignant
adversary
the
king
himself
be
dethroned
his
whole
empire
falls
to
ruins
how
alcohol
injures
the
brain
the
brain
the
nerve
centers
and
the
nerves
are
all
made
up
of
nerve
pulp
the
softest
and
most
delicate
tissue
in
the
whole
bodily
structure
wherever
this
fragile
material
occurs
in
our
bodies
the
skull
the
spine
the
trunk
or
the
limbs
architect
has
carefully
protected
it
from
violence
for
a
rough
touch
would
injure
it
or
even
tender
pressure
would
disturb
its
function
it
is
a
further
indication
of
the
supreme
importance
of
the
brain
that
about
of
the
entire
blood
of
the
body
is
furnished
to
it
manifestly
then
this
vital
organ
must
be
tenderly
cared
for
it
must
indeed
be
well
nourished
and
therefore
the
blood
sent
to
it
must
be
highly
nutrient
capable
of
supplying
oxygen
freely
this
condition
is
essential
to
successful
brain
action
but
intoxicants
bring
to
it
blood
surcharged
with
a
poisonous
liquid
and
bearing
only
a
limited
supply
of
oxygen
another
condition
of
a
healthy
brain
is
that
the
supply
of
blood
to
it
shall
be
equable
and
uniform
but
under
the
influence
of
strong
drink
the
blood
pours
into
the
paralyzed
arteries
a
surging
tide
that
floods
the
head
and
hinders
and
may
destroy
the
use
of
the
brain
and
the
senses
still
another
requirement
is
that
whatever
is
introduced
into
the
cerebral
tissues
having
first
passed
through
the
stomach
walls
and
thence
into
the
blood
shall
be
bland
not
irritating
but
in
the
brain
of
the
inebriate
are
found
not
only
the
distinct
odor
but
the
actual
presence
of
alcohol
thus
we
plainly
see
how
all
these
three
vital
conditions
of
a
healthy
brain
are
grossly
violated
by
the
use
of
intoxicants
think
there
is
a
great
deal
of
injury
being
done
by
the
use
of
alcohol
in
what
is
supposed
by
the
consumer
to
be
a
most
moderate
quantity
to
persons
who
are
not
in
the
least
intemperate
and
to
people
supposed
to
be
fairly
well
it
leads
to
degeneration
of
the
tissues
it
damages
the
health
it
injures
the
intellect
short
of
drunkenness
that
is
in
those
effects
of
it
which
stop
short
of
drunkenness
i
should
say
from
my
experience
that
alcohol
is
the
most
destructive
agent
we
are
aware
of
in
this
william
gull
the
most
eminent
english
physician
of
our
time
why
the
brain
suffers
from
the
alcoholic
habit
we
do
not
find
that
the
alcoholic
habit
has
produced
in
the
brain
the
same
coarse
injuries
that
we
see
in
other
organs
as
in
the
stomach
the
liver
or
the
heart
nor
should
we
expect
to
find
them
for
so
delicate
and
so
sensitive
is
the
structure
of
this
organ
that
a
very
slight
injury
here
goes
a
great
way
disturbance
may
be
overwhelming
to
the
brain
that
would
be
only
a
trifle
to
some
of
the
less
delicate
organs
alcohol
has
different
degrees
of
affinity
for
different
organs
of
the
body
but
much
the
strongest
for
the
cerebral
tissues
therefore
the
brain
feels
more
keenly
the
presence
of
alcohol
than
does
any
other
organ
almost
the
moment
that
the
poison
is

up

very
soon
its
paralyzed
are

this

is
in
a
certain
sense
exhilarating

from
this

the
falsity
of
this

alcohol
the
enemy
of
brain
work
the
healthy
brain
contains
a
larger
proportion
of
water
than
does
any
other
organ
now
alcohol
with
its
intense
affinity
for
water
absorbs
it
from
the
brain
and
thus
condenses
and
hardens
its
structure
one
of
the
important
elements
of
the
brain
is
its
albumen
this
also
is
contracted
by
alcohol
the
nerve
cells
and
fibers
gradually
become
shriveled
and
their
activity
is
lowered
the
elasticity
of
the
arteries
is
diminished
the
membranes
enveloping
the
brain
are
thickened
and
thus
all
proper
brain
nutrition
is
impaired
the
entire
organ
is
slowly
hardened
and
becomes
unfitted
for
the
proper
performance
of
its
delicate
duties
in
brief
alcohol
in
any

every

of

the

of

as
is
shown
by
the

of
the

the
thickened

and
the

the

is
often
affected
and
becomes
unable
to
respond
to
the
demand
for

as
appears
from
the
trembling

the
staggering

the
swaying

and
the
general
muscular
uncertainty
all
these
are
varied
results
of
the
temporary
paralysis
of
the
great
nerve
centers
besides
the
sensibility
of
the

is
deadened
the
inebriate

seize

hardly

it
or
wound

painfully
and
never

the
numbness
is
not
of
the
skin
but
of
the
brain
for
the
drunken
man
may
be
frozen
or
burned
to
death
without

too
are

only
perhaps
in

of

on

in
others
there
is
a
general
muscular

the

testify

nature
just
as
the

fail
to

correctly

fails
to

properly
over
the
inner
realm
mental
perceptions
are
dulled
the
stupefied
faculties
can
hardly
be
aroused
by
any
appeal
memory
fails
thus
the
man
is
disqualified
for
any
responsible
labor
no
railroad
company
no
mercantile
house
will
employ
any
one
addicted
to
drinking
the
mind
of
the
drunkard
is
unable
to
retain
a
single
chain
of
thought
but
gropes
about
with
idle
questionings
the
intellect
is
debased
judgment
is
impossible
for
the
unstable
mind
can
not
think
compare
or
decide
the
once
active
power
of
the
will
is
prostrate
and
the
victim
can
no
longer
resist
the
feeblest
impulse
of
temptation
the
grand
faculty
of
is
lost
and
as
a
result
the
baser
instincts
of
our
lower
nature
are
now
uppermost
greed
and
appetite
rule
unrestrained
but
the
moral
power
is
also
dragged
down
to
the
lowest
depths
all
the
finer
sensibilities
of
character
are
deadened
all
pride
of
personal
appearance
all

for
the
good
opinion
of
others
every
sense
of
decorum
and
at

every
pretence
of
decency
dignity
of
behavior
yields
to
clownish
silliness
and
the

is
now
an
object
of
pity
and
loathing

great
central
convictions
of

and
wrong
now

conscience

quenched
dishonesty
prevails
this
is
true
both
as
to
the
solemn
promises
which
prove
mere
idle
tales
and
also
as
to
property
for
he
resorts
to
any
form
of
fraud
or
theft
to
feed
the
consuming
craving
for
more

evil
results
of
alcoholism
inherited
but
the
calamity
does
not
end
with
the
offender
it
may
follow
down
the
family
line
and
fasten
itself
upon
the
unoffending
children
these
often
inherit
the
craving
for
drink
with
the
enfeebled
nature
that
can
not
resist
the
craving
and
so
are
almost
inevitably
doomed
to
follow
the
appalling
career
of
their
parents
before
them
nor
does
this
cruel
taint
stop
with
the
children
even
their
descendants
are
often
prone
to
become
perverse
as
one
example
careful
statistics
of
a
large
number
of
families
more
than
two
hundred
descended
from
drunkards
show
that
a
very
large
portion
of
them
gave
undoubted
proof
of
degeneration
this
was
plain
in
the
unusual
prevalence
of
infant
mortality
convulsions
epilepsy
hysteria
fatal
brain
diseases
and
actual
imbecility
it
is
found
that
the
habitual
user
of
alcoholic
drinks
the
man
who
is
never
intoxicated
but
who
will
tell
you
that
he
has
drunk
whiskey
all
his
life
without
being
harmed
by
it
is
more
likely
to
transmit
the
evil
effects
to
his
children
than
the
man
who
has
occasional
drunken
outbreaks
with
intervals
of
perfect
sobriety
between
by
his
frequently
repeated
small
drams
he
keeps
his
tissues
constantly
to
such
an
extent
that
they
are
seldom
free
from
some
of
the
more
or
less
serious
consequences
his
children
are
born
with
organisms
which
have
received
a
certain
bias
from
which
they
can
not
escape
they
are
freighted
with
some
heredity
or
predisposition
to
particular
forms
of
degeneration
to
some
morbid
tendency
to
an
enfeebled
constitution
to
various
defective
conditions
of
mind
and
body
let
the
children
of
such
a
man
attempt
to
imitate
the
drinking
habits
of
the
father
and
they
quickly
show
the
effects
moderate
drinking
brings
them
down
among
other
consequences
of
an
alcoholic
inheritance
which
have
been
traced
by
careful
observers
are
morbid
changes
in
the
nerve
centers
consisting
of
inflammatory
lesions
which
vary
according
to
the
age
in
which
they
occur
alcoholic
insanity
congenital
malformations
and
a
much
higher
infant
death
rate
owing
to
lack
of
vitality
than
among
the
children
of
normal
parents
where
the
alcoholic
inheritance
does
not
manifest
itself
in
some
definite
disease
or
disorder
it
can
still
be
traced
in
the
limitations
to
be
found
in
the
drinking
descendants
they
seem
to
reach
a
level
from
which
they
can
not
ascend
and
where
from
slight
causes
they
deteriorate
the
parents
by
alcoholic
poisoning
have
lowered
the
race
stock
of
vitality
beyond
the
power
of
ascent
or
possibility
to
rise
above
or
overcome
the
downward
tendency
of
course
these
effects
of
alcoholics
differ
widely
according
to
the
degree
of
intoxication
yet
we
must
not
forget
that
the
real
nature
of
inebriety
is
always
the
same
the
end
differs
from
the
beginning
only
in
degree
he
who
would
avoid
a
life
of
sorrow
disgrace
and
shame
must
carefully
shun
the
very
first

of

some
persons
are
drawn
into
the
use
of

solely
for
its
narcotic
and
intoxicating
influence
every
early
consent
to
its
use
involves
a
lurking
pledge
to
repeat

till
soon

cords
of
the

of
this

are
found
in
nearly
all
the

so
freely
sold
as

in

all
the

remedies
so
widely
and
unwisely
used
many
deaths
occur
from
the
use
of
these
opiates

at
first
seem
indeed
to
bring
relief
but
really
only
smother
the
prominent
symptoms

goes
on
unchecked

the
next
so
widely
different
are
the
effects
of
opiates
upon
different
ages
and
temperaments
but
it
is
upon
children
that
these
fatal
results
oftenest

unwisely
resort
to

procure

in
these
and
other
similar
cases
the
use
of
opiates
is
always
most
pernicious
the
amount
must
be
steadily
increased
to
obtain
the
elusive
repose
and
at
best
the
phantom
too
often
escapes
even
if
the
desired
sleep
is
procured
it
is
hardly
the
coveted

a
troubled

dreamy

quite
unrefreshed
the

aching

mouth
dry
and
the
stomach

devoid

far
worse
than
even

the
slavish
yielding

those

become

especially
if

down
they
are
liable
to
become
slowly

and
so
to

till

there
is
still
another
class
of
drugs
often
carelessly
used
whose
effect
while
less
directly
serious
than

is
yet

from
harmless

which
have
sprung

carelessly

trouble
the
random
arrow
may
yet
do

these
drugs
products
of
distillation
are
powerful
depressants
they
lower
the
action
of
the
heart
and
the
tone
of
the
nervous
centers
thus
the
effect
of
their
continued
use
is
to
so
diminish
the
vigor
of
the
system
as
to
aggravate
the
very
disorder
they
are
taken
to
relieve
effect
of
tobacco
on
the
nervous
system
that
the
use
of
tobacco
produces
a
pernicious
effect
upon
the
nervous
system
is
obvious
from
the
indignant
protest
of
the
entire
body
against
it
when
it
is
first
used
its
poisonous
character
is
amply
shown
by
the
distressing
prostration
and
pallor
the
dizziness
and
faintness
with
extreme
nausea
and
vomiting
which
follow
its
employment
by
a
novice
the
morbid
effects
of
tobacco
upon
the
nervous
system
of
those
who
habitually
use
it
are
shown
in
the
irregular
and
enfeebled
action
of
the
heart
with
dizziness
and
muscular
tremor
the
character
of
the
pulse
shows
plainly
the
unsteady
heart
action
caused
by
partial
paralysis
of
the
nerves
controlling
this
organ
old
habitual
smokers
often
show
an
irritable
and
nervous
condition
with
sleeplessness
due
doubtless
to
lack
of
proper
brain
nutrition
all
these
results
tend
to
prove
that
tobacco
is
really
a
nerve
poison
and
there
is
reason
to
suspect
that
the
nervous
breakdown
of
many
men
in
mature
life
is
often
due
to
the
continued
use
of
this
depressing
agent
this
is
shown
more
especially
in
men
of
sedentary
life
and
habits
as
men
of
active
habits
and
life
experience
less
of
the
ill
effects
of
tobacco
few
if
any
habitual
users
of
tobacco
ever
themselves
approve
of
it
they
all
regret
the
habit
and
many
lament
they
are
so
enslaved
to
it
that
they
can
not
throw
it
off
they
very
rarely
advise
any
one
to
follow
their
example
effects
of
tobacco
on
the
mind
with
this
continuously
depressing
effect
of
tobacco
upon
the
brain
it
is
little
wonder
that
the
mind
may
become
enfeebled
and
lose
its
capacity
for
study
or
successful
effort
this
is
especially
true
of
the
young
the
growth
and
development
of
the
brain
having
been
once
retarded
the
youthful
user
of
tobacco
especially
the
foolish
has
established
a
permanent
drawback
which
may
hamper
him
all
his
life
the
young
man
addicted
to
the
use
of
tobacco
is
often
through
its
use
retarded
in
his
career
by
mental
languor
or
weakening
will
power
and
by
mental
incapacity
the
keenness
of
mental
perception
is
dulled
and
the
ability
to
seize
and
hold
an
abstract
thought
is
impaired
true
these
effects
are
not
sharply
obvious
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
contrast
the
present
condition
of
any
one
person
with
what
it
might
have
been
but
the
comparison
of
large
numbers
conveys
an
instructive
lesson
scholars
who
start
well
and
give
promise
of
a
good
future
fail
by
the
way
the
honors
of
the
great
schools
academies
and
colleges
are
very
largely
taken
by
the
tobacco
abstainers
this
is
proved
by
the
result
of
repeated
and
extensive
comparisons
of
the
advanced
classes
in
a
great
number
of
institutions
in
this
country
and
in
europe
so
true
is
this
that
any
young
man
who
aspires
to
a
noble
career
should
bid
farewell
either
to
his
honorable
ambition
or
to
his
tobacco
for
the
two
very
rarely
travel
together
consequently
our
military
and
naval
academies
and
very
many
seminaries
and
colleges
prohibit
the
use
of
tobacco

chapter
xi
the
special
senses
the
special
senses
in
man
certain
special
organs
are
set
apart
the
particular
duty
of
which
is
to
give
information
of
the
nature
of
the
relations
which
he
sustains
to
the
great
world
of
things
and
of
which
he
is
but
a
mere
speck
the
special
senses
are
the
avenues
by
which
we
obtain
this
information
as
to
our
bodily
condition
the
world
around
us
and
the
manner
in
which
it
affects
us
animals
high
in
the
scale
are
affected
in
so
many
different
ways
and
by
so
many
agencies
that
a
subdivision
of
labor
becomes
necessary
that
the
sense
avenues
may
be
rigidly
guarded
one
person
alone
may
be
a
sufficient
watch
on
the
deck
of
a
sloop
but
an
ocean
steamer
needs
a
score
or
more
on
guard
each
with
his
special
duty
and
at
his
own
post
or
the
senses
are
like
a
series
of
disciplined
along
the
outposts
of
the
mind
to
take
note
of
events
and
to
report
to
headquarters
any
information
which
may
be
within
the
range
of
their
duty
thus
it
is
that
we
are
provided
with
a
number
of
special
senses
by
means
of
which
information
is
supplied
regarding
outward
forces
and
objects
these
are
touch
taste
smell
seeing
and
hearing
to
which
may
be
added
the
muscular
sense
and
a
sense
of
temperature
general
sensations
the
body
as
we
have
learned
is
made
up
of
a
great
number
of
complicated
organs
each
doing
its
own
part
of
the
general
work
required
for
the
life
and
vigor
of
the
human
organism
these
organs
should
all
work
in
harmony
for
the
good
of
the
whole
we
must
have
some
means
of
knowing
whether
this
harmony
is
maintained
and
of
receiving
timely
warning
if
any
organ
fails
to
do
its
particular
duty
such
information
is
supplied
by
the
common
or
general
sensations
thus
we
have
a
feeling
of
hunger
or
thirst
indicating
the
need
of
food
and
a
feeling
of
discomfort
when
imperfectly
clad
informing
us
of
the
need
of
more
clothing
to
these
may
be
added
the
sensation
of
pain
tickling
itching
and
so
on
the
needs
of
which
arise
from
the
complicated
structure
of
the
human
body
the
great
majority
of
sensations
result
from
some
stimulus
or
outward
agency
and
yet
some
sensations
such
as
those
of
faintness
restlessness
and
fatigue
seem
to
spring
up
within
us
in
some
mysterious
way
without
any
obvious
cause
essentials
of
a
sense
organ
certain
essentials
are
necessary
for
a
sensation
first
there
is
a
special
structure
adapted
to
a
particular
kind
of
influence
thus
the
ear
is
formed
specially
for
being
stimulated
by
the
waves
of
sound
while
the
eye
is
not
influenced
by
sound
but
responds
to
the
action
of
light
these
special
structures
are
called
terminal
organs
again
a
nerve
proceeds
from
the
special
structure
which
is
in
direct
communication
with
nerve
cells
in
the
brain
at
the
region
of
consciousness
this
last
point
is
important
to
remember
for
if
on
some
account
the
impression
is
arrested
in
the
connecting
nerve
no
sensation
will
result
thus
a
man
whose
spine
has
been
injured
may
not
feel
a
severe
pinch
on
either
leg
the
impression
may
be
quite
sufficient
to
stimulate
a
nerve
center
in
a
healthy
cord
so
as
to
produce
a
marked
reflex
act
but
he
has
no
sensation
because
the
injury
has
prevented
the
impression
from
being
carried
up
the
cord
to
the
higher
centers
in
the
brain
the
condition
of
sensation
it
is
thus
evident
that
while
an
impression
may
be
made
upon
a
terminal
organ
it
can
not
strictly
be
called
a
sensation
until
the
person
becomes
conscious
of
it
the
consciousness
of
an
impression
is
therefore
the
essential
element
of
a
sensation
it
follows
that
sensation
may
be
prevented
in
various
ways
in
the
sense
of
sight
for
example
one
person
may
be
blind
because
the
terminal
organ
or
eye
is
defective
or
diseased
another
may
have
perfect
eyes
and
yet
have
no
sight
because
a
tumor
presses
on
the
nerve
between
the
eye
and
the
brain
in
this
case
the
impression
fails
because
of
the
break
in
the
communication
once
more
the
eye
may
be
perfect
and
the
nerve
connection
unbroken
and
yet
the
person
can
not
see
because
the
center
in
the
brain
itself
is
injured
from
disease
or
accident
and
can
not
receive
the
impression
the
functions
of
the
brain
center
in
the
perception
of
an
impression
sensation
is
really
the
result
of
a
change
which
occurs
in
a
nerve
center
in
the
brain
and
yet
we
refer
impressions
to
the
various
terminal
organs
thus
when
the
skin
is
pinched
the
sensation
is
referred
to
the
skin
although
the
perception
is
in
the
brain
we
may
think
it
is
the
eyes
that
see
objects
in
reality
it
is
only
the
brain
that
takes
note
of
them
this
is
largely
the
result
of
education
and
habit
from
a
blow
on
the
head
one
sees
flashes
of
light
as
vividly
as
if
torches
actually
dance
before
the
eyes
impressions
have
reached
the
in
the
brain
from
irritation
of
the
optic
nerve
producing
the
same
effect
as
real
lights
would
cause
in
this
case
however
knowing
the
cause
of
the
colors
the
person
is
able
to
correct
the
erroneous
conclusion
as
a
result
of
a
depraved
condition
of
blood
the
itself
may
be
unduly
stimulated
and
a
person
may
see
objects
which
appear
real
thus
in
an
attack
of
delirium
tremens
the
victim
of
alcoholic
poisoning
sees
horrible
and
fantastic
creatures
the
diseased
brain
refers
them
as
usual
to
the
external
world
hence
they
appear
real
as
the
judgment
is
warped
by
the
alcoholic
liquor
he
can
not
correct
the
impressions
and
is
therefore
deceived
by
them
organs
of
special
sense
the
organs
of
special
sense
the
means
by
which
we
are
brought
into
relation
with
surrounding
objects
are
usually
classed
as
five
in
number
they
are
sometimes
fancifully
called
five

corpuscle
the
organ
of
touch
the
organ
of
touch
or
tactile
sensibility
is
the
most
widely
extended
of
all
the
special
senses
and
perhaps
the
simplest
it
is
certainly
the
most
precise
and
certain
in
its
results
it
is
this
sense
to
which
we
instinctively
appeal
to
escape
from
the
illusions
into
which
the
other
senses
may
mislead
us
it
has
its
seat
in
the
skin
all
over
the
body
and
in
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
nostrils
all
parts
of
the
body
however
do
not
have
this
sense
in
an
equal
degree
in
chapter
ix
we
learned
that
the
superficial
layers
of
the
skin
covers
and
dips
in
between
the
papillæ
we
also
learned
that
these
papillæ
are
richly
provided
with
and
sensory
nerve
fibers
sec
now
these
nerve
fibers
terminate
in
a
peculiar
way
in
those
parts
of
the
body
which
are
endowed
with
a
very
delicate
sense
of
touch
in
every
papilla
are
bodies
about
of
an
inch
long
around
which
the
nerve
fibers
wind
and
which
they
finally
enter
these
are
called
or
tactile
corpuscles
and
are
found
in
great
numbers
on
the
feet
and
toes
and
more
scantily
in
other
places
as
on
the
edges
of
the
eyelids
again
many
of
the
nerve
fibers
terminate
in
corpuscles
the
largest
about
of
an
inch
long
called
pacinian
corpuscles
these
are
most
numerous
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
and
the
sole
of
the
foot
in
the
papillæ
of
the
red
border
of
the
lips
the
nerves
end
in
capsules
which
enclose
one
or
more
fibers
and
are
called
the
great
majority
of
the
nerve
fibers
which
supply
the
skin
do
not
end
in
such
organs
they
oftener
divide
into
exceedingly
delicate
filaments
the
terminations
of
which
are
traced
with
the
greatest
difficulty
the
sense
of
touch
touch
is
a
sensation
of
contact
referred
to
the
surface
of
the
body
it
includes
three
things
sense
of
contact
the
sense
of
pressure
and
the
sense
of
heat
and
cold
the
sense
of
contact
is
the
most
important
element
in
touch
by
it
we
learn
of
the
form
size
and
other
properties
of
objects
as
their
smoothness
and
hardness
as
we
all
know
the
sense
of
touch
varies
in
different
parts
of
the
skin
it
is
most
acute
where
the
outer
skin
is
thinnest
the
tips
of
the
fingers
the
edges
of
the
lips
and
the
tip
of
the
tongue
are
the
most
sensitive
parts
even
the
nails
the
teeth
and
the
hair
have
the
sense
of
touch
in
a
slight
degree
when
the
scarf
skin
is
removed
the
part
is
not
more
sensitive
to
sense
of
contact
in
fact
direct
contact
with
the
unprotected
true
skin
occasions
pain
which
effectually
masks
the
feeling
of
touch
the
sense
of
touch
is
capable
of
education
and
is
generally
developed
to
an
extraordinary
degree
in
persons
who
are
deprived
of
some
other
special
sense
as
sight
or
hearing
we
read
of
the
famous
blind
sculptor
who
was
said
to
model
excellent
likenesses
guided
entirely
by
the
sense
of
touch
an
eminent
authority
on
botany
was
a
blind
man
able
to
distinguish
rare
plants
by
the
fingers
and
by
the
tip
of
the
tongue
the
blind
learn
to
read
with
facility
by
passing
their
fingers
over
raised
letters
of
a
coarse
type
it
is
impossible
to
contemplate
even
for
a
moment
the
prominence
assigned
to
the
sense
of
touch
in
the
physical
organism
without
being
impressed
with
the
manifestations
of
work
of
an
creator
muscular
sense
sense
of
temperature
pain
when
a
heavy
object
is
laid
upon
certain
parts
of
the
body
it
produces
a
sensation
of
pressure
by
it
we
are
enabled
to
estimate
differences
of
weight
if
an
attempt
be
made
to
raise
this
object
it
offers
resistance
which
the
muscles
must
overcome
this
is
known
as
the
muscular
sense
it
depends
on
sensory
nerves
originating
in
the
muscles
and
carrying
impressions
from
them
to
the
nerve
centers
the
skin
also
judges
to
a
certain
extent
of
heat
and
cold
these
sensations
can
be
felt
only
by
the
skin
direct
irritation
of
a
nerve
does
not
give
rise
to
them
thus
the
exposed
pulp
of
a
diseased
tooth
when
irritated
by
cold
fluids
gives
rise
to
pain
and
not
to
a
sensation
of
temperature
various
portions
of
the
body
have
different
degrees
of
sensibility
in
this
respect
the
hand
will
bear
a
degree
of
heat
which
would
cause
pain
to
some
other
parts
of
the
body
then
again
the
sensibility
of
the
outer
skin
seems
to
affect
the
sensibility
to
heat
for
parts
with
a
thin
skin
can
bear
less
heat
than
portions
with
a
thick
cuticle
experiment

how
the
sense
of
touch
is
a
matter
of

a
friend
run
the
tips
of
your
fingers

test
the
sense
of
ask
a
person
to
shut
his
eyes
touch
some
part
of
his
body
lightly
with
the
point
of
a
pin
and
ask
him
to
indicate
the
part
touched
as
to
the
general
temperature
this
sense
is
relative
and
is
much
modified
by
habit
for
what
is
cold
to
an
inhabitant
of
the
torrid
zone
would
be
warm
to
one
accustomed
to
a
very
cold
climate
pain
is
an
excessive
stimulation
of
the
sensory
nerves
and
in
it
all
finer
sensations
are
lost
thus
when
a
piece
of
hot
iron
burns
the
hand
the
sensation
is
the
same
as
when
the
iron
is
very
cold
and
extreme
cold
feels
like
intense
heat
the
organ
of
taste
the
sense
of
taste
is
located
chiefly
in
the
tongue
but
may
also
be
referred
even
to
the
regions
of
the
fauces
taste
like
touch
consists
in
a
particular
mode
of
nerve
termination
the
tongue
is
a
muscular
organ
covered
with
mucous
membrane
and
is
richly
supplied
with
and
nerves
by
its
complicated
movements
it
is
an
important
factor
in
chewing
in
swallowing
and
in
articulate
speech
the
surface
of
the
tongue
is
covered
with
irregular
projections
called
papillæ
processes
about
of
an
inch
high
interspersed
with
these
are
the
fungiform
papillæ
these
are
shaped
something
like
a
mushroom
and
may
often
be
detected
by
their
bright
red
points
when
the
rest
of
the
tongue
is
coated
towards
the
root
of
the
tongue
is
another
kind
of
papillæ
the
circumvallate
eight
to
fifteen
in
number
arranged
in
the
form
of
the
letter
v
with
the
apex
directed
backwards
these
are
so
called
because
they
consist
of
a
fungiform
papilla
surrounded
by
a
fold
of
mucous
membrane
presenting
the
appearance
of
being
walled
around
in
many
of
the
fungiform
and
most
of
the
circumvallate
papillæ
are
peculiar
structures
called
taste
buds
or
taste
goblets
these
exist
in
great
numbers
and
are
believed
to
be
connected
with
nerve
fibers
these
taste
buds
are
readily
excited
by
savory
substances
and
transmit
the
impression
along
the
connected
nerve
the
tongue
is
supplied
with
sensory
fibers
by
branches
from
the
fifth
and
eighth
pairs
of
cranial
nerves
the
former
confers

the

the
sense
of

is
excited
by
stimulation
of
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
tongue
and
of
the
palate
affecting
the
ends
of
the
nerve
fibers
taste
is
most
acute
in
or
near
the
circumvallate
papillæ
the
middle
of
the
tongue
is
scarcely
sensitive
to
taste
while
the
edges
and
the
tip
are
as
a
rule
highly
sensitive
certain
conditions
are
necessary
that
the
sense
of
taste
may
be
exercised
first
the
substance
to
be
tasted
must
be
in
or
be
soluble
in
the
fluids
of
the
mouth
insoluble
substances
are
tasteless
if
we
touch
our
tongue
to
a
piece
of
rock
crystal
there
is
a
sensation
of
contact
or
cold
but
no
sense
of
taste
on
the
other
hand
when
we
bring
the
tongue
in
contact
with
a
piece
of
rock
salt
we
experience
the
sensations
of
contact
coolness
and
saline
taste
again
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
mouth
must
be
when
the
mouth
is
dry
and
receives
substances
not
already
in
solution
there
is
no
saliva
ready
to
dissolve
them
hence
they
are
tasteless
this
absence
of
taste
is
common
with
the
parched
mouth
during
a
fever
the
tongue
assists
in
bringing
the
food
in
contact
with
the
nerves
by
pressing
it
against
the
roof
of
the
mouth
and
the
soft
palate
and
thus
is
produced
the
fullest
sense
of
taste
physiological
conditions
of
taste
the
tongue
is
the
seat
of
sensations
which
are
quite
unlike
each
other
thus
besides
the
sense
of
taste
there
is
the
sensation
of
touch
pressure
heat
and
cold
burning
or
acrid
feelings
and
those
produced
by
the
application
of
the
tongue
to
an
interrupted
electric
current
these
are
distinct
sensations
due
to
some
chemical
action
excited
probably
in
the
touch
cells
although
the
true
tastes
may
be
excited
by
causes
not
strictly
chemical
thus
a
smart
tap
on
the
tongue
may
excite
the
sensation
of
taste
in
the
majority
of
persons
the
back
of
the
tongue
is
most
sensitive
to
bitters
and
the
tip
to
sweets
saline
matters
are
perceived
most
distinctly
at
the
tip
and
acid
substances
at
the
sides
the
nerves
of
taste
are
sensitive
in
an
extraordinary
degree
to
some
articles
of
food
and
certain
drugs
for
example
the
taste
of
the
various
preparations
of
quinine
peppermint
and
wild
cherry
is
got
rid
of
with
difficulty
like
the
other
special
senses
that
of
taste
may
become
fatigued
the
repeated
tasting
of
one
substance
rapidly
deadens
the
sensibility
probably
by
some
savors
so
impress
the
nerves
of
taste
that
others
fail
to
make
any
impression
this
principle
is
used
to
make
disagreeable
medicine
somewhat
tasteless
thus
a
few
cloves
or
grains
of
coffee
or
a
bit
of
pepper
eaten
before
a
dose
of
castor
oil
renders
it
less
nauseous
flavor
is
something
more
than
taste
it
is
in
reality
a
mixed
sensation
in
which
smell
and
taste
are
both
concerned
as
is
shown
by
the
common
observation
that
one
suffering
from
a
cold
in
the
head
which
blunts
his
sense
of
smell
loses
the
proper
flavor
of
his
food
so
if
a
person
be
blindfolded
and
the
nose
pinched
he
will
be
unable
to
distinguish
between
an
apple
and
an
onion
if
one
be
rubbed
on
the
tongue
after
the
other
as
soon
as
the
nostrils
are
opened
the
difference
is
at
once
perceived

a
drop
of
vinegar
on
a
tongue
or
on
your
own

the

of

different
parts
of
the

the

it
seems
to
have

modifications
of
the
sense
of
taste
taste
is
modified
to
a
great
extent
by
habit
education
and
other
circumstances
articles
of
food
that
are
unpleasant
in
early
life
often
become
agreeable
in
later
years
there
is
occasionally
a
craving
especially
with
people
of
a
peculiar
nervous
organization
for
certain
unnatural
articles
as
chalk
and
laundry
starch
which
are
eaten
without
the
least
repugnance
again
the
most
savory
dishes
may
excite
disgust
while
the
simplest
articles
may
have
a
delicious
flavor
to
one
long
deprived
of
them
the
taste
for
certain
articles
is
certainly
acquired
this
is
often
true
of
raw
tomatoes
olives
and
especially
of
tobacco
the
organs
of
taste
and
smell
may
be
regarded
as
necessary
accessories
of
the
general
apparatus
of
nutrition
and
are
therefore
more
or
less
essential
to
the
maintenance
of
animal
life
while
taste
and
smell
are
generally
maintained
until
the
close
of
life
sight
and
hearing
are
often
impaired
by
time
and
may
be
altogether
destroyed

other
vital
functions
remaining
unimpaired
effect
of
tobacco
and
alcohol
upon

it
would
be
remarkable
if
tobacco
should
fail
to
injure
the
sense
of
taste
the
effect
produced
upon
the
tender
papillæ
of
the
tongue
by
the
juices
and
the
acrid
smoke
tends
to
impair
the
delicate
sensibility
of
the
entire
surface
the
keen
appreciation
of
fine
flavors
is
destroyed
the
once
clear
and
enjoyable
tastes
of
simple
objects
become
dull
and
vapid
thus
highly
spiced
and
seasoned
articles
of
food
are
in
demand
and
then
follows
continued
indigestion
with
all
its
suffering
again
the
burning
almost
caustic
effect
of
the
stronger
alcoholic
drinks
and
the
acrid
pungency
of
tobacco
smoke
are
disastrous
to
the
finer
perceptions
of
both
taste
and
odors
smell
the
sense
of
smell
is
lodged
in
the
delicate

man
in

sec
the
sense
of
smell
the
sense
of
smell
is
excited
by
the
contact
of
odorous
particles
contained
in
the
air
with
the
fibers
of
the
olfactory
nerves
which
are
distributed
over
the
delicate
surface
of
the
upper
parts
of
the
nasal
cavities
in
the
lower
parts
are
the
endings
of
nerves
of
ordinary
sensation
these
latter
nerves
may
be
irritated
by
some
substance
like
ammonia
resulting
in
a
powerfully
pungent
sensation
this
is
not
a
true
sensation
of
smell
but
merely
an
irritation
of
a
nerve
of
general
sensation
in
ordinary
quiet
breathing
the
air
simply
flows
along
the
lower
nasal
passages
into
the
pharynx
scarcely
entering
the
olfactory
chamber
at
all
this
is
the
reason
why
when
we
wish
to
perceive
a
faint
odor
we
sniff
up
the
air
sharply
by
so
doing
the
air
which
is
forcibly
drawn
into
the
nostrils
passes
up
even
into
the
higher
olfactory
chamber
where
some
of
the
floating
particles
of
the
odorous
material
come
into
contact
with
the
nerves
of
smell
one
of
the
most
essential
conditions
of
the
sense
of
smell
is
that
the
nasal
passages
be
kept
well
bathed
in
the
fluid
secreted
by
the
lining
membrane
at
the
beginning
of
a
cold
in
the
head
this
membrane
becomes
dry
and
swollen
thus
preventing
the
entrance
of
air
into
the
upper
chamber
deadening
the
sensibility
of
the
nerves
and
thus
the
sense
of
smell
is
greatly
diminished
the
delicacy
of
the
sense
of
smell
varies
greatly
in
different
individuals
and
in
different
animals
it
is
generally
more
acute
in
savage
races
it
is
highly
developed
in
both
the
carnivora
and
the
herbivora
many
animals
are
more
highly
endowed
with
this
sense
than
is
man
the
dog
for
example
appears
to
depend
on
the
sense
of
smell
almost
as
much
as
on
sight
it
is
well
known
also
that
fishes
have
a
sense
of
smell
fragments
of
bait
thrown
into
the
water
soon
attract
them
to
a
fishing
ground
and
at
depths
which
little
or
no
light
can
penetrate
deer
wild
horses
and
antelopes
probably
surpass
all
other
animals
in
having
a
vivid
sense
of
smell
smell
has
been
defined
as
at
a
distance
and
it
is
obvious
that
these
two
senses
not
only
form
a
natural
group
but
are
clearly
associated
in
their
physical
action
especially
in
connection
with
the
perception
of
the
flavor
of
food
the
sense
of
odor
gives
us
information
as
to
the
quality
of
food
and
drink
and
more
especially
as
to
the
quality
of
the
air
we
breathe
taste
is
at
the
gateway
of
the
alimentary
canal
while
smell
acts
as
the
sentinel
of
the
respiratory
tract
just
as
taste
and
flavor
influence
nutrition
by
affecting
the
digestive
process
so
the
agreeable
odors
about
us
even
those
of
the
perfumes
play
an
important
part
in
the
economy
of
life
the
sense
of
sight
the
sight
is
well
regarded
as
the
highest
and
the
most
perfect
of
all
our
senses
it
plays
so
common
and
so
beneficent
a
part
in
the
animal
economy
that
we
scarcely
appreciate
this
marvelous
gift
sight
is
essential
not
only
to
the
simplest
matters
of
daily
comfort
and
necessity
but
is
also
of
prime
importance
in
the
culture
of
the
mind
and
in
the
higher
forms

pleasure
it
opens
to
us
the
widest
and
the
most
varied
range
of
observation
and
enjoyment
the
pleasures
and
advantages
it
affords
directly
and
indirectly

presents
beyond

the
most
beautiful
example
of
design

workmanship

be
found
in
the
bodily
structure
it
is
the
watchful
sentinel
and
investigator
of
the
external
world
unlike
the
senses
of
taste
and

we
seem
by
the
sense
of
vision
to
become
aware
of
the
existence
of
objects
which
are
entirely
apart
from
us
and
which
have
no
direct
or
material
link
connecting
them
with
our
bodies
and
yet
we
are
told
that
in

another
and
such
an
exquisite
adaptation

part
to
the
great
object
of
the
whole
that
the
eye
is
properly
regarded
as
one
of
the
wonders
of
nature
the
eyeball
is
nearly
spherical
in
shape
but
is
slightly
elongated
from
before
backwards
the
front
part
is
clear
and
transparent
and
bulges
somewhat
prominently
to
allow
the
entrance
of
the
rays
of
light
the
eye
rests
in
a
socket
called
the
orbit
formed
by
parts
of
various
bones
of
the
head
and
face
the
margins
of
this
cavity
are
formed
of
strong
bone
which
can
withstand
heavy
blows
the
socket
is
padded
with
loose
fatty
tissue
and
certain
membranes
which
serve
as
a
soft
and
yielding
bed
in
which
the
eyeball
can
rest
and
move
without
injury
in
a
severe
sickness
this
fatty
tissue
is
absorbed
and
this
fact
explains
the
sunken
appearance
of
the
eyes
the
orbit
is
pierced
through
its
posterior
surface
by
an
opening
through
which
the
nerve
of
sight
the
optic
passes
to
the
eyeball
we
may
think
of
the
optic
nerve
holding
the
eyeball
much
as
the
stem
holds
the
apple
it
is
the
function
of
this
most
important
nerve
to
transmit
retinal
impressions
to
the
seat
of
consciousness
in
the
brain
where
they
are

the

its

called
ciliary

these

gradually
become
larger

at

muscle
of
the

the

a

the

the

this
is
the

up
of

really
an
expansion
of
the
ultimate

of
the

the

curious
structures
which
can
be
seen
only
with

for

a

cylinders
called

packed
together
not

these

are
to
be
regarded
as
the

of

just

it

serves
to
hold
the
choroid
and
the
retina
in
position
and
to
maintain
the
proper
relations
of
the
inner
structures
of
the
eye
the
iris
consists
of
a
framework
of
connective
tissue
the
surface
of
which
is
lined
by
cells
containing
pigment
which
gives
color
to
the

bundles
of
involuntary

fibers
are

of
the
iris
some
are
arranged
in
a
ring
round
the
margin
of
the
pupil
others
radiate
from
it
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
when
the
circular
fibers
contract
the
pupil
is
made
smaller
but
if
these
fibers
relax
the
radiating
fibers
cause
the
pupil
to
dilate
more
or
less
widely
the
crystalline
lens
just
behind
the
pupil
and
close
to
the
iris
is
a
body
called
the
crystalline

the

more

eyeball
but
is
enclosed
in
a
transparent
and
elastic
capsule
suspended
throughout
its
circumference
by
a
ligament
called
the
suspensory
ligament
this
ligament
not
only
retains
the
lens
in
place
but
is
capable
of
altering
its
shape
in
ordinary
conditions
of
the
eye
this
ligament
is
kept
tense
so
that
the
front
part
of
the
lens
is
flattened
somewhat
by
the
pressure
on
it
all
around
the
edge
where
the

sclerotic
and
choroid
meet
is
a
ring
of
involuntary
muscular
fibers
forming
the
ciliary
muscle
when
these
fibers
contract
they
draw
forwards
the
attachment
of
the
suspensory
ligament
of
the
lens
the
pressure
of
which
on
the
lens
is
consequently
diminished
the
elasticity
of
the
lens
causes
it
at
once
to
bulge
forwards
and
it
becomes
more
convex
the
ciliary
muscle
is
thus
known
as
the
muscle
of
accommodation
because
it
has
the
power
to
accommodate
the
eye
to
near
and
distant
objects
in
this
respect
it

its
use

to
the

the
eye
may
be
aptly
compared
in
many
particulars
to
the
photographic
camera
the
latter
of
course
is
much
simpler
in
structure
the
eyelid
forms
the
cap
which
being
removed
the
light
from
the
object
streams
through
the
eye
and
passes
across
the

chamber
to
the
retina
behind
which
corresponds
to
the
sensitive
plate
of
the
camera
the
transparent
structures
through
which
the
rays
of
light
pass
represent
the
lenses
to
prevent
any
reflected
light
from
striking
the
plate
and
interfering
with
the
sharpness
of
the

of
the
photographic
camera

uses
a
to
bring
to
a

the
rays
of
light
coming
from
objects
at
different
distances
thus
the
lens
of
the
camera
may
be
moved
nearer
to
or
farther
from

to
obtain
clear
images
the

must
be
accomplished
by
the
eye
when
the
eye
is
focused

near
objects
those
at

result
is
obtained
by
what
is
called
again
every
camera
has
an
arrangement
of
diaphragms
regulating
the
amount
of
light
this
is
a
rude
contrivance
compared
with
the
iris
which
by
means
of
its
muscular
fibers
can
in
a
moment
alter
the
size
of
the
pupil

serving
a
similar
purpose

all

were
all
of

an

these

the

the

these

sight
known
as

a
common
defect
of
vision
in
advancing
years
this
is
a
partial
loss
of
the
power
to
accommodate
the
eye
to

distances
this
defect
is
caused
by
an
increase
in

density
of

an
accompanying
diminution
in
the
ability
to
change

form
the
far
point
of
vision
is
not
changed

time

come
to
seek
the
advice

an
optician
a
convex
lens
may
be
needed
to
aid
the
failing
power
to
increase
the
convexity
of
the
lens
and
to
assist
it
in
bringing
the
divergent
rays

hypermetropia
both
the
near

sooner

later
it

distinct
effort
in
many
cases
becomes
a
serious
matter
and
demands
skillful
advice
and
careful
treatment
to
remedy
this
defect
something
must
be
done
to
throw
farther
back
the
rays
proceeding
from
an
object
so
that
they
will
come
to
a
focus
exactly
on
the
retina
this
is
done
by
means
of
concave
glasses
properly
adjusted
to
meet
the
conditions
of
the
eyes
the
selection
of
suitable
glasses
calls
for
great
care
as
much
harm
may
be
done

an
optical
condition
of

known
as

in

the

at
fault
in
this
defect
of
vision
the
curvature
of
the

is
greater
in
one
meridian
than
in
another

a
result
the

to
counteract
this

that
our
eyes
may
be
efficient
instruments
of

it
is
necessary

the
power
of
moving
independently
of
the

the
mechanical
arrangement
by
which
the
eyeballs
are
moved
in
different
directions
is
quite
simple

is
done
by
six
little
muscles

the

consists
of

flows
out
by

and
is
collected
at
the
inner

nasal
corner
here
in
each
lid
is
a
little
reddish
elevation
or
in
which
is
an
opening
communicating
with
a
small
canal
in
the
lid
which
joins
the
lacrymal
sac
lodged
between
the
orbit
and
the
bridge
of
the
nose
fig
from
this
sac
there
passes
a
channel
the
nasal
duct
about
of
an
inch
long
leading
into
the
lower
portion
of
the
nostril
the
fluid
which
has
flowed
over
the
eye
is
drained
off
by
these
canals
into
the
nose
during
sleep
this
secretion
is
much
diminished
when
the
eyes
are
open
the
quantity
is
sufficient
to
moisten
the
eyeball
the
excess
being
carried
into
the
nose
so
gradually
that
the
attention
is
not
attracted
to
it
the
lacrymal
canals
are
at
times
blocked
by
inflammation
of
the
nasal
duct
and
the
fluid
collects
in
the
corners
of
the
eyelids
and
overflows
down
the

producing

the
lining
membrane
of
the
eyelids
through
these

is
continuous
with
that
of
the
nostrils
hence
when
the
lining
membrane
of
the
eye
is
red
and
swollen
as
during
a
cold
the
nasal
passages
are
also
irritated
and
when
the
nasal
membrane
is
inflamed
the
irritation
is
apt
to
pass
upwards
and
affect
the
eyelids
the
tears
the
lacrymal
or
tear
gland
is
under
the
control
of
the
nervous
system
thus
if
anything
irritates
the
eyelids
the
sensory
nerves
are
stimulated
and
the
impression
is
carried
to
the
brain
thence
the
nerve
impulses
travel
to
the
lacrymal

leading
to
an
increased
flow
of
their

the

the
structure
of

ear
is
much
more
complicated
than
is
generally
supposed
it
is
an
apparatus
constructed
to
respond
to
the

a
whole
it
may
be
considered
a
peculiar
form
of

only
a
part
of
a
most
elaborate
apparatus
whereby
sound
waves
may
be
transmitted
inwards
to
the
real
organ
of
hearing
the
really
sensitive
part
of
the
ear
in
which
the
auditory
nerve
ends
is
buried
for
protection
deep
out
of
sight
in
the
bones
of
the
head
so
deep
that
sounds
can
not
directly
affect
it
some
arrangement
therefore
is
required
for
conducting
the
sounds
inwards
to
this
true
organ

in
studying
the
structure
of
the
ear
and
how
it
is
fitted
to
respond
to
sonorous
vibrations
we
may
divide
it
into
three
parts
the
part
known
as
the
external
ear
the
middle
ear
and
the
deeply
placed
nerve
portion
the
inner
ear
the
external
ear
the
external
ear
consists
of
an
expanded
portion
known
as
the
pinna
or
and
of
a
passage
the
auditory
canal
or
leading
inwards
from
it
the
surface
of
the
auricle
is
convoluted
to
collect
and
transmit
the
vibrations
of
air
by
which
sound
is
produced
the
auditory
canal
conducts
these
vibrations
to
the
tympanic
membrane
many
animals
move
the
auricle
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
thus
the
horse
pricks
up
its
ears
when
it
hears
a
noise
the
better
to
judge
of
the
direction
of

the
external
auditory
meatus
the
passage
to
the
middle
ear
is
curved
and
is
about
an
inch
and
a
quarter
long
near
its
outer
portion
are
a
number
of
fine
hairs
slanting
outwards
to
prevent
the
entrance
of
insects
embedded
in
the
deeper
parts
of
the
canal
are
glands
which
secrete
the
or
which
keeps
the
canal
moist

helps
to
protect
it
against
foreign
bodies
and
insects
as
the
result
of
a
cold
this
wax
may
collect
in
sufficient
quantities
to
block
the

and
to
diminish
to
a
considerable
extent
the
power
of
hearing
the

at
the
inner
end
of

is
the
tympanum
known
as

a
thin
oval
membrane
stretched
at
an
angle
across
the
deep
end
of

closes
the

thus
a
partition
between
the
passage
of
the
outer
ear
and
the
cavity
of
the
middle

on

is
a
small

chamber
in
the
petrous
portion
of
the
temporal

called
the
cavity

or
the

communicates
with
the
back
part
of
the
throat
by
the
eustachian
tube
this
tube
is
about
one
and
a
half
inches
long
and
lined
with
mucous
membrane
similar
to
that

this

there
is
no
communication
between
the
chamber
of
the

and
the
outside
except
by
the
eustachian

thus
a
throat
cold
with
redness
and
swelling
of
the
mucous
membrane
is
usually
accompanied
with
some
degree
of
deafness
because
the
swelling
may
block
the

oftentimes
by
a

the
throat
the
throat
is
a
double
highway
as
it
were
through
which
the
air
we
breathe
traverses
the
larynx
on
its
way
to
the
lungs
and
through
which
the
food
we
swallow
reaches
the
œsophagus
on
its
passage
to
the
stomach
it
is
therefore
a
very
important
region
of
the
body
being
concerned
in
the
great
acts
of
respiration

the
mechanism
of

may
be
more
easily
understood
by
a
study
of
fig
we
have
here
the

viewed
from

with
all
the
soft

with
it
on

down
the

cords
are
seen
enclosing
a
aperture
the

the
narrow
part
being
in

the
form
of
this
aperture
may
be
changed
by
the
delicately
coordinate
activities
of
the
muscles
of
the
larynx
for
instance
the
vocal
cords
may
be
brought
so
closely
together
that
the
space
becomes
a
mere
slit
air
forced
through
the
slit
will
throw
the
edges
of
the
folds
into
vibration
and
a
sound
will
be
produced
the
variations
in
the
form
of
the
opening
will
determine
the
variations
in
the
sound
now
if
the
various
muscles
of
the
larynx
be
relaxed
the
opening
of
the
glottis
is
wider
thus
the
air
enters
and
leaves
the
larynx
during
breathing
without
throwing
the
cords
into
vibration
enough
to
produce
any
sound
we
may
say
that
the
production
of
the
voice
is
effected
by
an
arrangement
like
that
of
some
musical
instruments
the
sounds
produced
by
the
vibrations
of
the
vocal

being
modified
by
the
tubes
above

musical
sounds
are
due
to
movements
or

occurring
with
a

regularity
and
they
differ
in

loudness
of
the

depends
upon
the

so
that

a

the

from
the

serve
to

the

thus
the

increase
with

force
of

we
have
just
learned
that
the
pitch
of
sound
depends
on
the
rapidity
of
the

this
depends
on
the
length
of

and
their
tightness

the
higher

the

the

of

about
shorter

of

hence
the
higher
pitch
of
the

they
produce
in

the
vocal

are
shorter

the

of

are
also
shorter

of

and
baritones
the
muscles
within
the
larynx
of
course
play
a
very
important
part
in
altering
the
tension
of
the
vocal
cords
those
qualities
of
the
voice
which
we
speak
of
as
sweet
harsh
and
sympathetic
depend
to
a
great
extent
upon
the
peculiar
structure
of
the
vocal
cords
of
the
individual
besides
the
physical
condition
of
the
vocal
cords
as
their
degree
of
smoothness
elasticity
thickness
and
so
on
other
factors
determine
the
quality
of
an
voice
thus
the
general
shape
and
structure
of
the
trachea
the
larynx
the
throat
and
mouth
all
influence
the
quality
of
voice
in
fact
the
air
passages
both
below

above
the
vibrating
cords
act
as
resonators
or
resounding
chambers
and
intensify
and
modify
the
sounds
produced
by
the

it
is
this
fact
that
prompts
skillful
teachers
of

to
urge
upon

the
organ
of
speech
is
perhaps
the
most
delicate
and
perfect
apparatus
in
the
whole
body
it
has
been
calculated
that
upwards
of
movements
per
minute
can
be
made
by
the
movable
organs
of
speech
during
reading
speaking
and
singing
it
is
said
that
no
less
than
a
hundred
different
muscles
are
called
into
action
in
talking
each
part
of
this
delicate
apparatus
is
so
admirably
adjusted
to
every
other
that
all
parts
of
this
most
complex
machinery
act
in
perfect
harmony
there
are
certain
articulate
sounds
called
vowel
or
vocal
from
the
fact
that
they
are
produced
by
the
vocal
cords
and
are
but
slightly
modified
as
they
pass
out
of
the
mouth
the
true
vowels
e
i
o
can
all
be
sounded
alone
and
may
be
prolonged
in
expiration
these
are
the
sounds
chiefly
used
in
singing
the
differences
in
their
characters
are
produced
by
changes
in
the
position
of
the
tongue
mouth
and
lips
consonants
are
sounds
produced
by
interruptions
of
the
outgoing
current
of
air
but
in
some
cases
have
no
sound
in
themselves
and
serve
merely
to
modify
vowel
sounds
thus
when
the
interruption
to
the
outgoing
current
takes
place
by
movements
of
the
lips
we
have
the
consonants
and
when
the
tongue
in
relation
with
the
teeth
or
hard
palate
obstructs
the
air
the
consonants
and
are
produced
such
as
and
are
due
to
the
movements
of
the
root
of
the
tongue
in
connection
with
the
soft
palate
or
pharynx
to
secure
an
easy
and
proper
production
of
articulate
sounds
the

tongue
and
palate
should
be
in
perfect
order
the
modifications
in
articulation
occasioned
by
a
defect
in
the
palate
or
in
the
uvula
by
the
loss
of
teeth
from
disease
and
from
congenital
defects
are
sufficiently
familiar
we
have
seen
that
speech
consists
essentially
in
a
modification
of
the
vocal
sounds
by
the
accessory
organs
or
by
parts
above
the
larynx
the
latter
being
the
essential
vocal
instrument
many
animals
have
the
power
of
making
articulated
sounds
a
few
have
risen
like
man
to
the
dignity
of
sentences
but
these
are
only
by
imitation
of
the
human
voice
both
vowels
and
consonants
can
be
distinguished
in
the
notes
of
birds
the
vocal
powers
of
which
are
generally
higher
than
those
of
mammals
the
latter
as
a
rule
produce
only
vowels
though
some
are
also
able
to
form
consonants
persons
idiotic
from
birth
are
incapable
of
producing
any
other
vocal
sounds
than
inarticulate
cries
although
supplied
with
all
the
internal
means
of
articulation
persons
deaf
and
dumb
are
in
the
same
situation
though
from
a
different
cause

one
being
incapable
of
imitating
and
the
other
being

incised
and
lacerated
wounds
an
incised
or
cut
wound
is
one
made
by
a
sharp
instrument
as
when
the
finger
is
cut
with
a
knife
such
a
wound
bleeds
freely
because
the
edges
do
not
favor
the
clotting
of
blood
in
slight
cuts
the
bleeding
readily
ceases
and
the
wound
heals
by
primary
union
or
by
intention
as
surgeons
call
it
lacerated
and
contused
wounds
are
made
by
a
tearing
or
bruising
instrument
for
example
catching
the
finger
on
a
nail
such
wounds
bleed
but
little
and
the
edges
and
surfaces
are
rough
and
ragged
if
the
incised
wound
is
deep
or
extensive
a
physician
is
necessary
to
bring
the
cut
edges
together
by
stitches
in
order
to
get
primary
union
oftentimes
in
severe
cuts
and
generally
in
lacerations
there
is
a
loss
of
tissue
so
that
the
wound
heals
by

contusion

an
injury
to
the
soft
tissues
caused
by
a
blow
from
some
blunt
instrument
or
a
fall
is
a
contusion
or
bruise
it
is
more
or
less
painful
followed
by
discoloration
due
to
the
escape
of
blood
under
the
skin
which
often
may
not
be
torn
through
a

a
knee
injured
by
a
fall
from
a
bicycle
and
a
finger
hurt
by
a
baseball
are
familiar
examples
of
this
sort

such

ordinarily
require
very
simple

the
main
thing
to
do
is
to
keep

the
simplest
way
to
do
it
the

elbows

sweep
them
upward

pull

tends
to
fill
the
lungs

chest
cavity
larger
now
return
the
arms
to
the
sides
of
the
body
until
they
press
hard
against
the
ribs
this
tends
to
force
out
the
air
this
makes
artificially
a
complete
act
of
respiration
repeat
this
act
about
fifteen
times
every
minute

all
this

any
such

then
be
gross
cruelty

be
lost
from
the
untimely
call
of
some
thoughtless
visitor

carry

to
the
very
letter
as
long
as
he
visits
you
make
on
a
slip
of

a
note
of
his
directions
make
a
brief
record
of
exactly
what
to
do
the

this
should
always
be
done
in
serious
cases
and

then
there
is
no

are

must
be
said
in

say
it
openly
and
aloud
how
often
a
sudden
turn
in
bed
or
a
quick
glance
of
inquiry
shows
that
whispering
is
doing
harm
if
the
patient
is
in
his
right
mind
answer
his
questions
plainly
and
squarely
it
may
not
be
best
to
tell
all
the
truth
but
nothing
is
gained
in
trying
to
avoid
a
straightforward
reply
noises
that
are
liable
to
disturb
the
patient
in
other
parts
of
the
house
than
the
should
be
avoided
sounds
of
a
startling
character
especially
those
not
easily
explained
as
the
rattling
or
slamming
of
distant
blinds
and
doors
are
always
irritating
to
the
sick
always
attract
the
attention
of
a
patient
before
addressing
him
otherwise
he
may
be
startled
and
a
nervous
spell
be
induced
the
same
hint
applies
equally
to
leaning
or
sitting
upon
the
or
running
against
furniture
in
moving
about
the
rest
of
mind
and
body
the
great
importance
of
rest
for
the
sick
is
not
so
generally
recognized
as
its
value
warrants
if
it
is
worry
and
not
work
that
breaks
down
the
mental
and
physical
health
of
the
well
how
much
more
important
is
it
that
the
minds
and
bodies
of
the
sick
should
be
kept
at
rest
free
from
worry
and
excitement
hence
the
skilled
nurse
does
her
best
to
aid
in
restoring
the
sick
to
a
condition
of
health
by
securing
for
her
patient
complete
rest
both
of
mind
and
body
to
this
end
she
skillfully
removes
all
minor
causes
of
alarm
irritation
or
worry
there
are
numberless
ways
in
which
this
may
be
done
of
which
space
does
not
allow
even
mention
details
apparently
trifling
as
noiseless
shoes
quietness
wearing
garments
that
do
not
rustle
use
of
small
pillows
of
different
sizes
and
countless
other
small
things
that
make
up
the
refinement
of
modern
nursing
play
an
important
part
in
building
up
the
impaired
tissues
of
the
sick
care
of
infectious
and
contagious
diseases
there
are
certain
diseases
which
are
known
to
be
infectious
and
can
be
communicated
from
one
person
to
another
either
by
direct
contact
through
the
medium
of
the
atmosphere
or
otherwise
of
the
more
prevalent
infectious
and
contagious
diseases
are
fever
diphtheria
erysipelas
and
considerations
of
health
demand
that
a
person
suffering
from
any
one
of
these
diseases
should
be
thoroughly
isolated
from
all
other
members
of
the
family
all
that
has
been
stated
in
regard
to
general
nursing
in
previous
sections
of
this
chapter
applies
of
course
to
nursing
infectious
and
contagious
diseases
in
addition
to
these
certain
special
directions
must
be
always
kept
in
mind
upon
the
nurse
or
the
person
having
the
immediate
charge
of
the
patient
rests
the
responsibility
of
preventing
the
spread
of
infectious
diseases
the
importance
must
be
fully
understood
of
carrying
out
in
every
detail
the
measures
calculated
to
check
the
spread
or
compass
the
destruction
of
the

should
be
put
to
soak
at

in
disinfectants
and
afterward
boiled
apart
from
the

scrupulously
clean
by
frequent
boiling

worn
articles
of

that
can
be
destroyed
should
be

so
far
as
possible
during
convalescence
or
when
ready
to
leave
isolation
the
patient
should
be
thoroughly
bathed
in
water
properly
disinfected
the
hair
and
nails
especially
being
carefully
treated
many
details
of
the
after
treatment
depend
upon
the
special
disease
as
the
rubbing
of
the
body
with
carbolized
vaseline
after
scarlet
fever
the
care
of
the
eyes
after
measles
and
other

here
poisons
and
their
antidotes
poisons
a
poison
is
a
substance
which
if
taken
into
the
system
in
sufficient
amounts
will
cause
serious
trouble
or
death
for
convenience
poisons
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
irritants
and
narcotics
the
effects
of
irritant
poisons
are
evident
immediately
after
being
taken
they
burn
and
corrode
the
skin
or
membrane
or
other
parts
with
which
they
come
in
contact
there
are
burning
pains
in
the
mouth
throat
stomach
and
abdomen
with
nausea
and
vomiting
a
certain
amount
of
faintness
and
shock
is
also
present
with
narcotic
poisoning
the
symptoms
come
on
more
slowly
after
a
time
there
is
drowsiness
which
gradually
increases
until
there
is
a
profound
sleep
or
stupor
from
which
the
patient
can
be
aroused
only
with
great
difficulty
there
are
some
substances
which
possess
both
the
irritant
and
narcotic
properties
and
in
which
the
symptoms
are
of
a
mixed
character
treatment
of
poisoning
an
antidote
is
a
substance
which
will
either
combine
with
a
poison
to
render
it
harmless
or
which
will
have
a
directly
opposite
effect
upon
the
body
thus
neutralizing
the
effect
of
the
poison
hence
in
treatment
of
poisoning
the
first
thing
to
do
if
you
know
the
special
poison
is
to
give
its
antidote
at
once
if
the
poison
is
unknown
and
there
is
any
delay
in
obtaining
the
antidote
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
remove
the
poison
from
the
stomach
therefore
cause
vomiting
as
quickly
as
possible
this
may
be
done
by
an
emetic
given
as
follows
stir
a
tablespoonful
of
mustard
or
of
common
salt
in
a
glass
of
warm
water
and
make
the
patient
swallow
the
whole
it
will
usually
be
vomited
in
a
few
moments
if
mustard
or
salt
is
not
at
hand
compel
the
patient
to
drink
lukewarm
water
very
freely
until
vomiting
occurs
vomiting
may
be
hastened
by
thrusting
the
forefinger
down
the
throat
two
teaspoonfuls
of
the
syrup
of
ipecac
or
a
heaping
teaspoonful
of
powdered
ipecac
taken
in
a
cup
of
warm
water
make
an
efficient
emetic
especially
if
followed
with
large
amounts
of
warm
water
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
in
some
poisons
as
certain
acids
and
alkalies
no
emetic
should
be
given
again
for
certain
poisons
except
in
case
of
arsenic
causing
local
irritation
but
which
also
affect
the
system
at
large

emetic

any

unless
its
exact
nature
is
known
if
there
is
the
least
doubt
about
the
substance
do
not
assume
the

risk

destroy
it
at

often
take
by
mistake
with
serious
and
often
fatal
results
poisonous
doses
of
carbolic
acid
poison
oxalic
acid
and
other
poisons
a
safe
rule
is
to
keep
all
bottles
and
boxes
containing
poisonous
substances
securely
bottled
or
packed
and
carefully
labeled
with
the
word
poison
plainly
written
in
large

across
the
label
fasten
the

of
a
bottle
containing
poison
to
the
bottle
itself
with
copper
or
iron
wire
twisted
into
a
knot
at
the
top
this
is
an
effective
means
of
preventing
any
mistakes
especially
in
the
night
this
subject
of
poisons
assumes
nowadays
great
importance
as
it
is
a
common
custom
to
keep
about
stables
workshops
bathrooms
and
living
rooms
generally
a
more
or
less
formidable
array
of
germicides
disinfectants
and
other
preparations
of
a
similar
character
for
the
most
part
they
contain
poisonous
ingredients
bacteria
nature
of
bacteria
the
word
bacteria
is
the
name
applied
to
very
low
forms
of
plant
life
of
microscopic
size
thus
if
hay
be
soaked
in
water
for
some
time
and
a
few
drops
of
the
liquid
are
examined
under
a
high
power
of
the
microscope
the
water
is
found
to
be
swarming
with
various
forms
of
living
vegetable
organisms
or
bacteria
these
microscopic
plants
belong
to
the
great
fungus
division
and
consist
of
many
varieties
which
may
be
roughly
divided
into
groups
according
as
they
are
spherical
spiral
or
otherwise
in
shape
each
plant
consists
of
a
mass
of
protoplasm
surrounded
by
an
cell
wall
the
bacteria
vary
considerably
in
size
some
of
the
varieties
are
from
to
of
an
inch
in
length
and
average
about
of
an
inch
in
diameter
it
has
been
calculated
that
a
space
of
one
cubic
millimeter
would
contain
of
these
minute
organisms
and
that
they
would
not
weigh
more
than
a
milligram

so
on
the
rapidity
with
which
these

multiply
under
favorable
conditions
makes
them
in
some
cases
most
dangerous
enemies
it
has
been
calculated
that
if
all
of
the
organisms
survived
one
bacterium
would
lead
to
the
production
of
several
billions
of
others
in
hours
the
struggle
of
bacteria
for
existence
like
all
kinds
of
living
things
many
species
of
bacteria
are
destroyed
if
exposed
to
boiling
water
or
steam
but
seem
able
to
endure
prolonged
cold
far
below

and
rivers

contain
numerous
germs
which
resume
their
activity
when
the
ice
is
melted
typhoid

germs
have
been
known
to
take
an
active
and
vigorous
growth
after
they
have
been
kept
for
weeks
exposed
in
ice
to
a
temperature
below
zero
the
bacteria
of

bacillus
tuberculosis
may
retain
their
vitality
for
months
and
then
the
dried
expectoration
of
the
invalids
may
become
a
source
of
danger
to
those
who
inhale
air
laden
with
such
impurities
sec
and
fig
like
other
living
organisms
bacteria
need
warmth
moisture
and
some
chemical
compound
which
answers
for
food
in
order
to
maintain
the
phenomena
of
life
some
species
grow
only
in
contact
with
air
others
need
no
more
oxygen
than

importance
of
bacteria
in

we
might
well
ask
why
the
myriads
of
bacteria
do
not
devastate
the
earth
with
their
marvelous
rapidity
of
propagation
so
indeed
they
might
were
it
not
for
the
winds
rains
melting
snow
and
ice
which
scatter
them
far
and
wide
and
destroy
them
again
as
in
countless
other
species
of
living
organisms
bacteria
are
subject
to
the
relentless
law
which
allows
only
the
fittest
to
survive
the
bacteria
of
higher
and
more
complex
types
devour
those
of
a
lower
type
myriads
perish
in
the
digestive
tract
of
man
and
other
animals
the
excreta
of
some
species
of
bacteria
act
as
poison
to
destroy
other
species
it
is
true
from
the
strictest
scientific
point
of
view
that
all
living
things
literally
return
to
the
dust
whence
they
came
while
living
they
borrow
a
few
elementary
substances
and
arrange
them
in
new
combinations
by
aid
of
the
energy
given
them
by
the
sun
and
after
a
time
die
and
leave
behind
all
they
had
borrowed
both
of
energy
and
matter
countless
myriads
of
bacteria
are
silently
at
work
changing

and
vegetable

the
elements
necessary
to

it
would
be
embalmed
in
the

of
the
dead
action
of
bacteria
in
certain
processes
bacteria
have
the
power
of
bringing
about
decomposition
of
various
kinds
thus
a
highly
organized
fungus
like
the
yeast
plant
growing
in
the
presence
of
sugar
has
the
power
of
breaking
down
this
complex
body
into
simpler
ones
alcohol
and
carbon
dioxid
in
the
same
way
various
forms
of
bacteria
have
the
power
of
breaking
down
complex
bodies
in
their
immediate
neighborhood
the
products
depending
upon
the
substance
the
kind
of
bacteria
and
the
conditions
under
which
they
act
thus
the
act
upon
the
milk
sugar
present
in
milk
and
convert
it
into
lactic
acid
thus
bringing
about
the
souring

are
harmless
some
are

admittance
to
the

under
certain
conditions
these
bacteria
known
as
when
established

of
the
body
bring
about
important
chemical
changes
depending
upon
the
species
of

and
also
produce
a
particular
form
of
disease
the
production
of
certain
diseases
by
the
agency
of
bacteria
has
now
been
proved
beyond
all
doubt
in
yellow
fever
erysipelas
diphtheria
typhoid
fever
consumption
and
other
diseases
the
connection
has
been
definitely
established
the
evil
results
these
germs
of
disease
produce
vary
greatly
in
kind
and
severity
thus
the
bacteria
of
asiatic
cholera
and
diphtheria
may
destroy
life
in
a
few
hours
while
those
of
consumption
may
take
years
to
produce
a
fatal
result
again
the
bacteria
may
attack
some
particular
organ
or
group
of
organs
and
produce
mostly
local
symptoms
thus
in
a
boil
there
is
painful
swelling
due
to
the
local
effect
of
the
bacteria
with
slight
general
disturbance
the
battle
against
bacteria
when
we
reflect
upon
the
terrible
ravages
made
by
infectious
diseases
and
all
their
attendant
evils
for
these
many
years
we
can
the
better
appreciate
the
work
done
of
late
years
by
tireless
scientists
in
their
efforts
to
modify
the
activity
of
bacteria
it
is
now
possible
to
cultivate
certain
pathogenic
bacteria
and
by
modifying
the
conditions
under
which
they
are
grown
to
destroy
their
violence
in
brief
science
has
taught
us
within
certain
limitations
how
to
change
the
virulent
germs
of
a
few
diseases
into
harmless
microbes
alcoholic
fermentation
and
bacteria
men
of
the
lowest
as
well
as
of
the
highest
type
of
civilization
have
always
known
that
when
the
sugary
juice
of
any
fruit
is
left
to
itself
for
a
time
at
a
moderately
warm
temperature
a
change
takes
place
under
certain
conditions
and
the
result
is
a
liquid
which
when
drank
produces
a
pronounced
effect
upon
the
body
in
brief
man
has
long
known
how
to
make
for
himself
alcoholic
beverages
by
means
of
which
he
may
become
intoxicated
with
their
poisonous
ingredients
whether
it
is
a
degraded
south
sea
islander
making
a
crude
intoxicant
from
a
sugary
plant
a
japanese
preparing
his
favorite
alcoholic
beverage
from
the
fermentation
of
rice
by
means
of
a
fungus
plant
grown
for
the
purpose
a
farmer
of
this
country
making
cider
from
fermenting
apple
juice
or
a
french
expert
manufacturing
costly
champagne
by
a
complicated
process
the
outcome
and
the
intent
are
one
and
the
same
the
essential
thing
is
to
produce
an
alcoholic
beverage
which
will
have
a
marked
physiological
effect
this
effect
is
poisonous
and
is
due
solely
to
the
alcoholic
ingredient
without
which
man
would
have
little
or
no
use
for
the
otherwise
harmless
liquid
while
the
practical
process
of
making
some
form
of
alcoholic
beverage
has
been
understood
for
these
many
centuries
the
real
reason
of
this
remarkable
change
in
a
wholesome
fruit
juice
was
not
known
until
revealed
by
recent
progress
in
chemistry
and
by
the
use
of
the
microscope
we
know
now
that
the
change
is
due
to
fermentation
brought
about
from
the
influence
and
by
the
action
of
bacteria
sec
in
other
words
fermentation
is
the
result
of
the
growth
of
low
form
of
vegetable
life
known
as
an
organised
ferment
the
ferment
whether
it
be
the
commonly
used
yeast
or
any
other
species
of
alcoholic
ferment
has
the
power
to
decompose
or
break
down
a
large
part
of
the
sugar
present
in
the
liquid
into
alcohol
which
remains
as
a
poison
and
which
escapes
more
or
less
completely
thus
man
ever
prone
to
do
evil
was
once
obliged
in
his
ignorance
to
make
his
alcoholic
drinks
in
the
crudest
manner
but
now
he
has
forced
into
his
service
the
latest
discoveries
in
science
more
especially
in
bacteriology
that
he
may
manufacture
more
scientifically
and
more
economically
alcoholic
beverages
of
all
sorts
and
kinds
and
distribute
them
broadcast
all
over

the
physical
and
moral
ruin
of

disinfectants
disinfectants
antiseptics
and

the
word
disinfectant
is
synonymous
with
the
term

a
disinfectant
is
a
substance
which
destroys
infectious
material
an
antiseptic
is
an
agent
which
may
hinder
the
growth
but
does
not
destroy
the
vitality
of
bacteria
a
deodorant
is
not
necessarily
a
disinfectant
or
even
an
antiseptic
but
refers
to
a
substance
that
destroys
or
masks
offensive
odors

two
most

is
evident
that

by
other
means
the
destruction

costly
means
of

dry

the

its
limitations
the
scope

is
necessarily
extremely
limited
compared
with
what
may
be
done
with
the
costly
and
elaborate
apparatus
of
the
medical
laboratory
again
the
foundation
of
physiology
rests
upon
systematic
and
painstaking
dissection
of
the
dead
human
body
and
the
lower
animals
which
mode
of
study
very
properly
is
not
permitted
in
ordinary
school
work
experiments

the
living
human

and
the
lower

now
so
generally
depended

in
our
medical

more
advanced
scientific
schools
for
obvious
reasons
can
be
performed
only
in
a
crude
and
quite
superficial
manner
in
secondary
schools
hence
in
the
study
of
physiology
in
schools
many
things
must
be
taken
for
granted
the
observation
and
experience
of
medical
men
and
the
experiments
of
the
physiologist
in
his
laboratory
must
be
depended
upon
for
data
which
can
not
be
well
obtained
at
first
hand
by
young
students
value
of
experiments
in
physiology
in
secondary
schools
while
circumstances
and
regard
for
certain
proprieties
of
social
life
forbid
the
use
of
a
range
of
experiments
in
anatomy
and
physiology
such
as
are
permitted
in
other
branches
of
science
in
secondary
schools
it
by
no
means
follows
that
we
are
shut
out
altogether
from
this
most
important
and
interesting
part
of
the
study
however
simple
and
crude
the
apparatus
the
skillful
and
enthusiastic
teacher
has
at
his
command
a
wide
series
of
materials
which
can
be
profitably
utilized
for
experimental
instruction
as
every
experienced
teacher
knows
pupils
gain
a
far
better
knowledge
and
keep
up
a
livelier
interest
in
any
branch
of
science
if
they
see
with
their
own
eyes
and
do
with
their

the

the
experimental
method
of

rivets
the
attention
and
arouses
and
keeps
alive
the
interest
of
the
young

in

it
is
the
only
true
method
of
cultivating
a
scientific
habit
of
study
the
as
set
forth
on
the
printed
pages
of
this
book
should
be
mastered
of
course
but
at
the
same
time
the
topics
discussed
should
be
illuminated
and
made
more
interesting
and
practical
by
a
series
of
experiments
a
goodly
show
of
specimens
and
a
certain
amount
of
microscopical
work
the
question
of
apparatus
the
author
well
understands
from
personal
experience
the
many
practical
difficulties
in
the
way
of
providing
a
suitable
amount
of
apparatus
for
classroom
use
if
there
are
ample
funds
for
this
purpose
there
need
be
no
excuse
or
delay
in
providing
all
that
is
necessary
from
dealers
in
apparatus
in
the
larger
towns
from
the
drug
store
markets
and
elsewhere
in
schools
where
both
the
funds
and
the
time
for
such
purposes
are
limited
the
zeal
and
ingenuity
of
teachers
and
students
are
often
put
to
a
severe
test
fortunately
a
very
little
money
and
a
great
deal
of
ingenuity
and
patience
will
do
apparent
wonders
towards
providing
a
working
supply
of
apparatus
it
will
be
noticed
that
many
of
the
experiments
in
the
preceding
chapters
of
this
book
can
be
performed
with
very
simple
and
often
a
crude
and
sort
of

this
plan
has
been
rigidly
followed
by
the
author
first
because
he
fully
realizes
the
limitations
and
restrictions
of
the
subject
and
secondly
because
he
wishes
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
expensive
and
complicated

is
by
no
means
necessary
to

the
great
principles
of

and
physiology
use
of
the
microscope
to
do
thorough
and
satisfactory
work
in

in
our
higher
schools
a
compound
microscope
is
almost
indispensable
inasmuch
as
many
of
our
best
secondary
schools
are
equipped
with
one
or
more
microscopes
for
use
in
other
studies
notably
botany
it
is
much
less
difficult
than
it
was
a
few
years
ago
to
obtain
this
important
help
for
the
classes
in

a
but
and
strong
instrument
should
be
provided
if

does
not
own

the
loan
of
an
instrument
should
be
obtained
for
at

a
few
weeks
from
some
person
in

neighborhood
the
appearance
of
the
various
structures
and
tissues
of
the
human
body
as
revealed
by
the
microscope
possesses
a
curious
fascination
for
every
observer
especially
for
young
people
no
one
ever
forgets
the
first
look
at
a

the
use

the
study
of
the
bones
by
the
help
of
a
skeleton
is
almost
a
necessity
to
this
intent
schools
of
a
higher
grade
should
be
provided
both
with
a
skeleton
and
a
manikin
if
the
former
is
not
owned
by
the
school
oftentimes
a
loan
of
one
can
be
secured
of
some
medical
man
in
the
vicinity
separate
bones
will
also
prove
useful
in
fact
there
is
no
other
way
to
study
properly
the
structure
and
use
of
the
bones
and
joints
than
by
the
bones
themselves
a
good
manikin
is
also
equally
serviceable
although
not
so
commonly
provided
for
schools
on
account
of
its
cost
the
question
of
vivisection
and
dissection
there
should
be
no
question
at
all
concerning
vivisection
no
shape
or
form
should
it
be
allowed
in
any
grade
of
our
nor
is
there
any
need
of
much
dissection
in
the
grades
a
few
simple
dissections
to
be
performed
with
fresh
tendons
of
turkey
legs
and
so
on
will
never
engender
cruel
or
brutal
feelings
toward
living
things
in
the
lower
grades
a
discreet
teacher
will
rarely
advise
his
pupils
to
dissect
a
dead
cat
dog
frog
or
any
other
animal
instead
of
actual
dissection
the
pupils
should
examine
specimens
or
certain
parts
previously
dissected
by
the
teacher
the
muscles
and
tendons
of
a
sheep
the
heart
of
an
ox
the
eye
of
a
codfish
and
so
on
even
under
these
restrictions
the
teacher
should
not
use
the
knife
or
scissors
before
the
class
to
open
up
any
part
of
the
specimen
in
brief
avoid
everything
that
can
possibly
arouse
any
cruel
or
brutal
feeling
on
the
part
of
young
students
in
the
higher
schools
in
normal
and
other
training
schools
different
conditions
prevail
never
allow
vivisection
in
any
form
whatever
either
in

or
at
home
under
the
most
exact
restrictions
students
in
these
schools
may
be
taught
to
make
a
few
simple
dissections
most
teachers
will
find
however
even
in
schools
of
a
higher
grade
that
the
whole
subject
is
fraught
with
many
difficulties
it
will
not
require
much
oftentimes
to
provoke
in
a
community
a

of
unjust
criticism

anatomy

in
all
of
our
leading
medical
colleges
the
students
are
carefully
and
thoroughly
drilled
on
a
study
of
certain
persons
selected
as
models
the
object
is
to
master
by
observation
and
manipulation
the
details
of
what
is
known
as
surface
anatomy
and
landmarks
now
while
detailed
work
of
this
kind
is
not
necessary
in
secondary
schools
yet
a
limited
amount
of
study
along
these
lines
is
deeply
interesting
and
profitable
the
habit
of
looking
at
the
living
body
with
anatomical
eyes
and
with
eyes
at
our
ends
during
the
course
in
physiology
can
not
be
too
highly
estimated
in
elementary
work
it
is
only
fair
to
state
that
many
points
of
surface
anatomy
and
many
of
the
landmarks
can
not
always
be
defined
or
located
with
precision
a
great
deal
in
this
direction
can
however
be
done
in
higher
schools
with
ingenuity
patience
and
a
due
regard
for
the
feelings
of
all
concerned
students
should
be
taught
to
examine
their
own
bodies
for
this
purpose
two
friends
may
thus
work
together
each
serving
as
a

the
other
to

following
syllabus
may
be
added
such
other
similar

as

be
distinctly
felt
at
the

of
the
head
this
is
always
the
thickest
part
often
of
an
inch
or
more
of
the

is
more
prominent
in
some
than
in
others
the
thinnest
part
is
over
the
temples
where
it
may
be
almost
as
thin
as
parchment
the

out
of
the
glenoid
cavity
and
returns
to
its
socket
when
the

lies
the
zygoma
one
of
the
most
marked
and
important
landmarks
to
the
touch
and
in
lean
persons
to
the
eye
the
sliding
movement
of
the

the
chest
can
be
properly
understood
only
on
the
living
subject
it
can
move
not
only
upwards
and
downwards
as
in
shrugging
the
shoulders
backwards
and
forwards
as
in
throwing
back
the
shoulders
but
it
has
a
rotary
movement
round
a
movable
center
this
rotation
is
seen
while
the
arm
is
being
raised
from
the
horizontal
to
the
vertical
position
and
is
effected
by
the
cooperation
of
the

can
be
felt
all
the
way
down
the
inner

can
be
felt
but
not
so
plainly
the
head
of

a
good
landmark
on
the
outer
side
of
the

about
one
inch
below
the
top
of
the

note
that
it
is
placed
well
back
and
that
it
forms
no

of
the
humerus
it
distinctly
moves
under

in

removed
the

jawbone
from
a
young

leaving
the

by

the
entire

grew
again
and
the

resumed
their
original
places
as
it
grew
the
mechanism
of
this
remarkable
effect
is
clearly
shown
by
an
experiment
which
the
late
oliver
wendell
holmes
used
to
take
delight
in
performing
in
his
anatomical
lectures
at
the
harvard
medical

he
had
a
strong
iron
bar
made
into
a
ring
of
some
eight
inches
in
diameter
with
a
space
left
between
the
ends
just
large
enough
to
be
filled
by
an
english
walnut
the
ring
was
then
dropped
to
the
floor
so
as
to
strike
on
the
convexity
just
opposite
to
the

which
invariably
was

do
not
lie

a
delicate
serous
membrane
called
the
peritoneum
it
envelops
in
a

degree
all
the

in
the

and
forms
folds
by
which
they
are
connected
with

are
attached

its
arrangement
is
therefore
very
complicated
when
the

comes
in
contact
with
the
large
intestine
it
passes
over
it
just
as
the

are
suspended
from
the
back
wall
of
the

by
a
double
fold
of

peritoneum
called
the
mesentery
the

are
also
protected
from

by
several
folds
of

this

known
as
the

smoothly
on

on
the
other

in

may
increase
in

may
become
greatly
distended

the

essentially
of

the
fact
that
