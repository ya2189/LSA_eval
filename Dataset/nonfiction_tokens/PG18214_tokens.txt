our
friend
the
dog
i
i
have
lost
within
these
last
few
days
a
little
he
had
just
completed
the
sixth
month
of
his
brief
existence
he
had
no
history
his
intelligent
eyes
opened
to
look
out
upon
the
world
to
love
mankind
then
closed
again
on
the
cruel
secrets
of
death
the
friend
who
presented
me
with
him
had
given
him
perhaps
by
antiphrasis
the
startling
name
of
pelléas
why
rechristen
him
for
how
can
a
poor
dog
loving
devoted
faithful
disgrace
the
name
of
a
man
or
an
imaginary
hero
pelléas
had
a
great
bulging
powerful
forehead
like
that
of
socrates
or
verlaine
and
under
a
little
black
nose
blunt
as
a
churlish
assent
a
pair
of
large
hanging
and
symmetrical
chops
which
made
his
head
a
sort
of
massive
obstinate
pensive
and
menace
he
was
beautiful
after
the
manner
of
a
beautiful
natural
monster
that
has
complied
strictly
with
the
laws
of
its
species
and
what
a
smile
of
attentive
obligingness
of
incorruptible
innocence
of
affectionate
submission
of
boundless
gratitude
and
total
lit
up
at
the
least
caress
that
adorable
mask
of
ugliness
whence
exactly
did
that
smile
emanate
from
the
ingenuous
and
melting
eyes
from
the
ears
pricked
up
to
catch
the
words
of
man
from
the
forehead
that
unwrinkled
to
appreciate
and
love
or
from
the
stump
of
a
tail
that
wriggled
at
the
other
end
to
testify
to
the
intimate
and
impassioned
joy
that
filled
his
small
being
happy
once
more
to
encounter
the
hand
or
the
glance
of
the
god
to
whom
he
surrendered
himself
illustration
pelléas
was
born
in
paris
and
i
had
taken
him
to
the
country
his
bonny
fat
paws
shapeless
and
not
yet
stiffened
carried
slackly
through
the
unexplored
pathways
of
his
new
existence
his
huge
and
serious
head
and
as
it
were
rendered
heavy
with
thought
for
this
thankless
and
rather
sad
head
like
that
of
an
overworked
child
was
beginning
the
overwhelming
work
that
oppresses
every
brain
at
the
start
of
life
he
had
in
less
than
five
or
six
weeks
to
get
into
his
mind
taking
shape
within
it
an
image
and
a
satisfactory
conception
of
the
universe
man
aided
by
all
the
knowledge
of
his
own
elders
and
his
brothers
takes
thirty
or
forty
years
to
outline
that
conception
but
the
humble
dog
has
to
unravel
it
for
himself
in
a
few
days
and
yet
in
the
eyes
of
a
god
who
should
know
all
things
would
it
not
have
the
same
weight
and
the
same
value
as
our
own
it
was
a
question
then
of
studying
the
ground
which
can
be
scratched
and
dug
up
and
which
sometimes
reveals
surprising
things
of
casting
at
the
sky
which
is
uninteresting
for
there
is
nothing
there
to
eat
one
glance
that
does
away
with
it
for
good
and
all
of
discovering
the
grass
the
admirable
and
green
grass
the
springy
and
cool
grass
a
field
for
races
and
sports
a
friendly
and
boundless
bed
in
which
lies
hidden
the
good
and
wholesome
it
was
a
question
also
of
taking
promiscuously
a
thousand
urgent
and
curious
observations
it
was
necessary
for
instance
with
no
other
guide
than
pain
to
learn
to
calculate
the
height
of
objects
from
the
top
of
which
you
can
jump
into
space
to
convince
yourself
that
it
is
vain
to
pursue
birds
who
fly
away
and
that
you
are
unable
to
clamber
up
trees
after
the
cats
who
defy
you
there
to
distinguish
between
the
sunny
spots
where
it
is
delicious
to
sleep
and
the
patches
of
shade
in
which
you
shiver
to
remark
with
stupefaction
that
the
rain
does
not
fall
inside
the
houses
that
water
is
cold
uninhabitable
and
dangerous
while
fire
is
beneficent
at
a
distance
but
terrible
when
you
come
too
near
to
observe
that
the
meadows
the
and
sometimes
the
roads
are
haunted
by
giant
creatures
with
threatening
horns
creatures
perhaps
and
at
any
rate
silent
creatures
who
allow
you
to
sniff
at
them
a
little
curiously
without
taking
offence
but
who
keep
their
real
thoughts
to
themselves
it
was
necessary
to
learn
as
the
result
of
painful
and
humiliating
experiment
that
you
are
not
at
liberty
to
obey
all
laws
without
distinction
in
the
dwelling
of
the
gods
to
recognize
that
the
kitchen
is
the
privileged
and
most
agreeable
spot
in
that
divine
dwelling
although
you
are
hardly
allowed
to
abide
in
it
because
of
the
cook
who
is
a
considerable
but
jealous
power
to
learn
that
doors
are
important
and
capricious
volitions
which
sometimes
lead
to
felicity
but
which
most
often
hermetically
closed
mute
and
stern
haughty
and
heartless
remain
deaf
to
all
entreaties
to
admit
once
and
for
all
that
the
essential
good
things
of
life
the
indisputable
blessings
generally
imprisoned
in
pots
and
stewpans
are
almost
always
inaccessible
to
know
how
to
look
at
them
with
indifference
and
to
practise
to
take
no
notice
of
them
saying
to
yourself
that
here
are
objects
which
are
probably
sacred
since
merely
to
skim
them
with
the
tip
of
a
respectful
tongue
is
enough
to
let
loose
the
unanimous
anger
of
all
the
gods
of
the
house
illustration
and
then
what
is
one
to
think
of
the
table
on
which
so
many
things
happen
that
can
not
be
guessed
of
the
derisive
chairs
on
which
one
is
forbidden
to
sleep
of
the
plates
and
dishes
that
are
empty
by
the
time
that
one
can
get
at
them
of
the
lamp
that
drives
away
the
dark
how
many
orders
dangers
prohibitions
problems
enigmas
has
one
not
to
classify
in
one
overburdened
memory
and
how
to
reconcile
all
this
with
other
laws
other
enigmas
wider
and
more
imperious
which
one
bears
within
one
self
within
one
instinct
which
spring
up
and
develop
from
one
hour
to
the
other
which
come
from
the
depths
of
time
and
the
race
invade
the
blood
the
muscles
and
the
nerves
and
suddenly
assert
themselves
more
irresistibly
and
more
powerfully
than
pain
the
word
of
the
master
himself
or
the
fear
of
death
thus
for
instance
to
quote
only
one
example
when
the
hour
of
sleep
has
struck
for
men
you
have
retired
to
your
hole
surrounded
by
the
darkness
the
silence
and
the
formidable
solitude
of
the
night
all
is
sleep
in
the
master
house
you
feel
yourself
very
small
and
weak
in
the
presence
of
the
mystery
you
know
that
the
gloom
is
peopled
with
foes
who
hover
and
lie
in
wait
you
suspect
the
trees
the
passing
wind
and
the
moonbeams
you
would
like
to
hide
to
suppress
yourself
by
holding
your
breath
but
still
the
watch
must
be
kept
you
must
at
the
least
sound
issue
from
your
retreat
face
the
invisible
and
bluntly
disturb
the
imposing
silence
of
the
earth
at
the
risk
of
bringing
down
the
whispering
evil
or
crime
upon
yourself
alone
whoever
the
enemy
be
even
if
he
be
man
that
is
to
say
the
very
brother
of
the
god
whom
it
is
your
business
to
defend
you
must
attack
him
blindly
fly
at
his
throat
fasten
your
perhaps
sacrilegious
teeth
into
human
flesh
disregard
the
spell
of
a
hand
and
voice
similar
to
those
of
your
master
never
be
silent
never
attempt
to
escape
never
allow
yourself
to
be
tempted
or
bribed
and
lost
in
the
night
without
help
prolong
the
heroic
alarm
to
your
last
breath
there
is
the
great
ancestral
duty
the
essential
duty
stronger
than
death
which
not
even
man
will
and
anger
are
able
to
check
all
our
humble
history
linked
with
that
of
the
dog
in
our
first
struggles
against
every
breathing
thing
tends
to
prevent
his
forgetting
it
and
when
in
our
safer
of
we
happen
to
punish
him
for
his
untimely
zeal
he
throws
us
a
glance
of
astonished
reproach
as
though
to
point
out
to
us
that
we
are
in
the
wrong
and
that
if
we
lose
sight
of
the
main
clause
in
the
treaty
of
alliance
which
he
made
with
us
at
the
time
when
we
lived
in
caves
forests
and
fens
he
continues
faithful
to
it
in
spite
of
us
and
remains
nearer
to
the
eternal
truth
of
life
which
is
full
of
snares
and
hostile
forces
but
how
much
care
and
study
are
needed
to
succeed
in
fulfilling
this
duty
and
how
complicated
it
has
become
since
the
days
of
the
silent
caverns
and
the
great
deserted
lakes
it
was
all
so
simple
then
so
easy
and
so
clear
the
lonely
hollow
opened
upon
the
side
of
the
hill
and
all
that
approached
all
that
moved
on
the
horizon
of
the
plains
or
woods
was
the
unmistakable
enemy
but
you
can
no
longer
tell
you
have
to
acquaint
yourself
with
a
civilization
of
which
you
disapprove
to
appear
to
understand
a
thousand
incomprehensible
things
thus
it
seems
evident
that
henceforth
the
whole
world
no
longer
belongs
to
the
master
that
his
property
conforms
to
unintelligible
limits
it
becomes
necessary
therefore
first
of
all
to
know
exactly
where
the
sacred
domain
begins
and
ends
whom
are
you
to
suffer
whom
to
stop
there
is
the
road
by
which
every
one
even
the
poor
has
the
right
to
pass
why
you
do
not
know
it
is
a
fact
which
you
deplore
but
which
you
are
bound
to
accept
fortunately
on
the
other
hand
here
is
the
fair
path
which
none
may
tread
this
path
is
faithful
to
the
sound
traditions
it
is
not
to
be
lost
sight
of
for
by
it
enter
into
your
daily
existence
the
difficult
problems
of
life
would
you
have
an
example
you
are
sleeping
peacefully
in
a
ray
of
the
sun
that
covers
the
threshold
of
the
kitchen
with
pearls
the
earthenware
pots
are
amusing
themselves
by
elbowing
and
nudging
one
another
on
the
edge
of
the
shelves
trimmed
with
paper
the
copper
stewpans
play
at
scattering
spots
of
light
over
the
smooth
white
walls
the
motherly
stove
hums
a
soft
tune
and
dandles
three
saucepans
blissfully
dancing
and
from
the
little
hole
that
lights
up
its
inside
defies
the
good
dog
who
can
not
approach
by
constantly
putting
out
at
him
its
fiery
tongue
the
clock
bored
in
its
oak
case
before
striking
the
august
hour
of
meal
time
swings
its
great
gilt
navel
to
and
fro
and
the
cunning
flies
tease
your
ears
on
the
glittering
table
lie
a
chicken
a
hare
three
partridges
besides
other
things
which
are
called
fruits
peaches
melons
grapes
and
which
are
all
good
for
nothing
the
cook
guts
a
big
silver
fish
and
throws
the
entrails
instead
of
giving
them
to
you
into
the
ah
the
inexhaustible
treasury
receptacle
of
windfalls
the
jewel
of
the
house
you
shall
have
your
share
of
it
an
exquisite
and
surreptitious
share
but
it
does
not
do
to
seem
to
know
where
it
is
you
are
strictly
forbidden
to
rummage
in
it
man
in
this
way
prohibits
many
pleasant
things
and
life
would
be
dull
indeed
and
your
days
empty
if
you
had
to
obey
all
the
orders
of
the
pantry
the
cellar
and
the
luckily
he
is
and
does
not
long
remember
the
instructions
which
he
lavishes
he
is
easily
deceived
you
achieve
your
ends
and
do
as
you
please
provided
you
have
the
patience
to
await
the
hour
you
are
subject
to
man
and
he
is
the
one
god
but
you
none
the
less
have
your
own
personal
exact
and
imperturbable
morality
which
proclaims
aloud
that
illicit
acts
become
most
lawful
through
the
very
fact
that
they
are
performed
without
the
master
knowledge
therefore
let
us
close
the
watchful
eye
that
has
seen
let
us
pretend
to
sleep
and
to
dream
of
the
moon
hark
a
gentle
tapping
at
the
blue
window
that
looks
out
on
the
garden
what
is
it
nothing
a
bough
of
hawthorn
that
has
come
to
see
what
we
are
doing
in
the
cool
kitchen
trees
are
inquisitive
and
often
excited
but
they
do
not
count
one
has
nothing
to
say
to
them
they
are
irresponsible
they
obey
the
wind
which
has
no
principles
but
what
is
that
i
hear
steps
up
ears
open
nose
on
the
alert
it
is
the
baker
coming
up
to
the
rails
while
the
postman
is
opening
a
little
gate
in
the
hedge
of
they
are
friends
it
is
well
they
bring
something
you
can
greet
them
and
wag
your
tail
discreetly
twice
or
thrice
with
a
patronizing
smile
another
alarm
what
is
it
now
a
carriage
pulls
up
in
front
of
the
steps
the
problem
is
a
complex
one
before
all
it
is
of
consequence
to
heap
copious
insults
on
the
horses
great
proud
beasts
who
make
no
reply
meantime
you
examine
out
of
the
corner
of
your
eye
the
persons
alighting
they
are
and
seem
full
of
confidence
they
are
probably
going
to
sit
at
the
table
of
the
gods
the
proper
thing
is
to
bark
without
acrimony
with
a
shade
of
respect
so
as
to
show
that
you
are
doing
your
duty
but
that
you
are
doing
it
with
intelligence
nevertheless
you
cherish
a
lurking
suspicion
and
behind
the
backs
stealthily
you
sniff
the
air
persistently
and
in
a
knowing
way
in
order
to
discern
any
hidden
intentions
but
halting
footsteps
resound
outside
the
kitchen
this
time
it
is
the
poor
man
dragging
his
crutch
the
unmistakable
enemy
the
hereditary
enemy
the
direct
descendant
of
him
who
roamed
outside
the
cave
which
you
suddenly
see
again
in
your
racial
memory
drunk
with
indignation
your
bark
broken
your
teeth
multiplied
with
hatred
and
rage
you
are
about
to
seize
their
reconcilable
adversary
by
the
breeches
when
the
cook
armed
with
her
broom
the
ancillary
and
forsworn
sceptre
comes
to
protect
the
traitor
and
you
are
obliged
to
go
back
to
your
hole
where
with
eyes
filled
with
impotent
and
slanting
flames
you
growl
out
frightful
but
futile
curses
thinking
within
yourself
that
this
is
the
end
of
all
things
and
that
the
human
species
has
lost
its
notion
of
justice
and
injustice
is
that
all
not
yet
for
the
smallest
life
is
made
up
of
innumerous
duties
and
it
is
a
long
work
to
organize
a
happy
existence
upon
the
borderland
of
two
such
different
worlds
as
the
world
of
beasts
and
the
world
of
men
how
should
we
fare
if
we
had
to
serve
while
remaining
within
our
own
sphere
a
divinity
not
an
imaginary
one
like
to
ourselves
because
the
offspring
of
our
own
brain
but
a
god
actually
visible
ever
present
ever
active
and
as
foreign
as
superior
to
our
being
as
we
are
to
the
dog
illustration
we
now
to
return
to
pelléas
know
pretty
well
what
to
do
and
how
to
behave
on
the
master
premises
but
the
world
does
not
end
at
the
and
beyond
the
walls
and
beyond
the
hedge
there
is
a
universe
of
which
one
has
not
the
custody
where
one
is
no
longer
at
home
where
relations
are
changed
how
are
we
to
stand
in
the
street
in
the
fields
in
the
in
the
shops
in
consequence
of
difficult
and
delicate
observations
we
understand
that
we
must
take
no
notice
of
obey
no
calls
but
the
master
be
polite
with
indifference
to
strangers
who
pet
us
next
we
must
conscientiously
fulfil
certain
obligations
of
mysterious
courtesy
toward
our
brothers
the
other
dogs
respect
chickens
and
ducks
not
appear
to
remark
the
cakes
at
the
which
spread
themselves
insolently
within
reach
of
the
tongue
show
to
the
cats
who
on
the
steps
of
the
houses
provoke
us
by
hideous
grimaces
a
silent
contempt
but
one
that
will
not
forget
and
remember
that
it
is
lawful
and
even
commendable
to
chase
and
strangle
mice
rats
wild
rabbits
and
generally
speaking
all
animals
we
learn
to
know
them
by
secret
marks
that
have
not
yet
made
their
peace
with
mankind
all
this
and
so
much
more
was
it
surprising
that
pelléas
often
appeared
pensive
in
the
face
of
those
numberless
problems
and
that
his
humble
and
gentle
look
was
often
so
profound
and
grave
laden
with
cares
and
full
of
unreadable
questions
illustration
alas
he
did
not
have
time
to
finish
the
long
and
heavy
task
which
nature
lays
upon
the
instinct
that
rises
in
order
to
approach
a
brighter
region
an
ill
of
a
mysterious
character
which
seems
specially
to
punish
the
only
animal
that
succeeds
in
leaving
the
circle
in
which
it
is
born
an
indefinite
ill
that
carries
off
hundreds
of
intelligent
little
dogs
came
to
put
an
end
to
the
destiny
and
the
happy
education
of
pelléas
and
now
all
those
efforts
to
achieve
a
little
more
light
all
that
ardour
in
loving
that
courage
in
understanding
all
that
affectionate
gaiety
and
innocent
fawning
all
those
kind
and
devoted
looks
which
turned
to
man
to
ask
for
his
assistance
against
unjust
death
all
those
flickering
gleams
which
came
from
the
profound
abyss
of
a
world
that
is
no
longer
ours
all
those
nearly
human
little
habits
lie
sadly
in
the
cold
ground
under
a
flowering
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
ii
man
loves
the
dog
but
how
much
more
ought
he
to
love
it
if
he
considered
in
the
inflexible
harmony
of
the
laws
of
nature
the
sole
exception
which
is
that
love
of
a
being
that
succeeds
in
piercing
in
order
to
draw
closer
to
us
the
partitions
every
elsewhere
impermeable
that
separate
the
species
we
are
alone
absolutely
alone
on
this
chance
planet
and
amid
all
the
forms
of
life
that
surround
us
not
one
excepting
the
dog
has
made
an
alliance
with
us
a
few
creatures
fear
us
most
are
unaware
of
us
and
not
one
loves
us
in
the
world
of
plants
we
have
dumb
and
motionless
slaves
but
they
serve
us
in
spite
of
themselves
they
simply
endure
our
laws
and
our
yoke
they
are
impotent
prisoners
victims
incapable
of
escaping
but
silently
rebellious
and
so
soon
as
we
lose
sight
of
them
they
hasten
to
betray
us
and
return
to
their
former
wild
and
mischievous
liberty
the
rose
and
the
corn
had
they
wings
would
fly
at
our
approach
like
the
birds
among
the
animals
we
number
a
few
servants
who
have
submitted
only
through
indifference
cowardice
or
stupidity
the
uncertain
and
craven
horse
who
responds
only
to
pain
and
is
attached
to
nothing
the
passive
and
dejected
ass
who
stays
with
us
only
because
he
knows
not
what
to
do
nor
where
to
go
but
who
nevertheless
under
the
cudgel
and
the
retains
the
idea
that
lurks
behind
his
ears
the
cow
and
the
ox
happy
so
long
as
they
are
eating
and
docile
because
for
centuries
they
have
not
had
a
thought
of
their
own
the
affrighted
sheep
who
knows
no
other
master
than
terror
the
hen
who
is
faithful
to
the
because
she
finds
more
maize
and
wheat
there
than
in
the
neighbouring
forest
i
do
not
speak
of
the
cat
to
whom
we
are
nothing
more
than
a
too
large
and
uneatable
prey
the
ferocious
cat
whose
sidelong
contempt
tolerates
us
only
as
encumbering
parasites
in
our
own
homes
she
at
least
curses
us
in
her
mysterious
heart
but
all
the
others
live
beside
us
as
they
might
live
beside
a
rock
or
a
tree
they
do
not
love
us
do
not
know
us
scarcely
notice
us
they
are
unaware
of
our
life
our
death
our
departure
our
return
our
sadness
our
joy
our
smile
they
do
not
even
hear
the
sound
of
our
voice
so
soon
as
it
no
longer
threatens
them
and
when
they
look
at
us
it
is
with
the
distrustful
bewilderment
of
the
horse
in
whose
eye
still
hovers
the
infatuation
of
the
elk
or
gazelle
that
sees
us
for
the
first
time
or
with
the
dull
stupor
of
the
ruminants
who
look
upon
us
as
a
momentary
and
useless
accident
of
the
pasture
for
thousands
of
years
they
have
been
living
at
our
side
as
foreign
to
our
thoughts
our
affections
our
habits
as
though
the
least
fraternal
of
the
stars
had
dropped
them
but
yesterday
on
our
globe
in
the
boundless
interval
that
separates
man
from
all
the
other
creatures
we
have
succeeded
only
by
dint
of
patience
in
making
them
take
two
or
three
illusory
steps
and
if
leaving
their
feelings
toward
us
untouched
nature
were
to
give
them
the
intelligence
and
the
weapons
wherewith
to
conquer
us
i
confess
that
i
should
distrust
the
hasty
vengeance
of
the
horse
the
obstinate
reprisals
of
the
ass
and
the
maddened
meekness
of
the
sheep
i
should
shun
the
cat
as
i
should
shun
the
tiger
and
even
the
good
cow
solemn
and
somnolent
would
inspire
me
with
but
a
wary
confidence
as
for
the
hen
with
her
round
quick
eye
as
when
discovering
a
slug
or
a
worm
i
am
sure
that
she
would
devour
me
without
a
thought
iii
now
in
this
indifference
and
this
total
want
of
comprehension
in
which
everything
that
surrounds
us
lives
in
this
incommunicable
world
where
everything
has
its
object
hermetically
contained
within
itself
where
every
destiny
is
where
there
exist
among
the
creatures
no
other
relations
than
those
of
executioners
and
victims
eaters
and
eaten
where
nothing
is
able
to
leave
its
sphere
where
death
alone
establishes
cruel
relations
of
cause
and
effect
between
neighbouring
lives
where
not
the
smallest
sympathy
has
ever
made
a
conscious
leap
from
one
species
to
another
one
animal
alone
among
all
that
breathes
upon
the
earth
has
succeeded
in
breaking
through
the
prophetic
circle
in
escaping
from
itself
to
come
bounding
toward
us
definitely
to
cross
the
enormous
zone
of
darkness
ice
and
silence
that
isolates
each
category
of
existence
in
unintelligible
plan
this
animal
our
good
familiar
dog
simple
and
unsurprising
as
may
appear
to
us
what
he
has
done
in
thus
perceptibly
drawing
nearer
to
a
world
in
which
he
was
not
born
and
for
which
he
was
not
destined
has
nevertheless
performed
one
of
the
most
unusual
and
improbable
acts
that
we
can
find
in
the
general
history
of
life
when
was
this
recognition
of
man
by
beast
this
extraordinary
passage
from
darkness
to
light
effected
did
we
seek
out
the
poodle
the
collie
or
the
mastiff
from
among
the
wolves
and
the
jackals
or
did
he
come
spontaneously
to
us
we
can
not
tell
so
far
as
our
human
annals
stretch
he
is
at
our
side
as
at
present
but
what
are
human
annals
in
comparison
with
the
times
of
which
we
have
no
witness
the
fact
remains
that
he
is
there
in
our
houses
as
ancient
as
rightly
placed
as
perfectly
adapted
to
our
habits
as
though
he
had
appeared
on
this
earth
such
as
he
now
is
at
the
same
time
as
ourselves
we
have
not
to
gain
his
confidence
or
his
friendship
he
is
born
our
friend
while
his
eyes
are
still
closed
already
he
believes
in
us
even
before
his
birth
he
has
given
himself
to
man
but
the
word
friend
does
not
exactly
depict
his
affectionate
worship
he
loves
us
and
reveres
us
as
though
we
had
drawn
him
out
of
nothing
he
is
before
all
our
creature
full
of
gratitude
and
more
devoted
than
the
apple
of
our
eye
he
is
our
intimate
and
impassioned
slave
whom
nothing
discourages
whom
nothing
repels
whose
ardent
trust
and
love
nothing
can
impair
he
has
solved
in
an
admirable
and
touching
manner
the
terrifying
problem
which
human
wisdom
would
have
to
solve
if
a
divine
race
came
to
occupy
our
globe
he
has
loyally
religiously
irrevocably
recognized
man
superiority
and
has
surrendered
himself
to
him
body
and
soul
without
without
any
intention
to
go
back
reserving
of
his
independence
his
instinct
and
his
character
only
the
small
part
indispensable
to
the
continuation
of
the
life
prescribed
by
nature
with
an
unquestioning
certainty
an
unconstraint
and
a
simplicity
that
surprise
us
a
little
deeming
us
better
and
more
powerful
than
all
that
exists
he
betrays
for
our
benefit
the
whole
of
the
animal
kingdom
to
which
he
belongs
and
without
scruple
denies
his
race
his
kin
his
mother
and
his
young
illustration
but
he
loves
us
not
only
in
his
consciousness
and
his
intelligence
the
very
instinct
of
his
race
the
entire
unconsciousness
of
his
species
it
appears
think
only
of
us
dream
only
of
being
useful
to
us
to
serve
us
better
to
adapt
himself
better
to
our
different
needs
he
has
adopted
every
shape
and
been
able
infinitely
to
vary
the
faculties
the
aptitudes
which
he
places
at
our
disposal
is
he
to
aid
us
in
the
pursuit
of
game
in
the
plains
his
legs
lengthen
inordinately
his
muzzle
tapers
his
lungs
widen
he
becomes
swifter
than
the
deer
does
our
prey
hide
under
wood
the
docile
genius
of
the
species
forestalling
our
desires
presents
us
with
the
basset
a
sort
of
almost
footless
serpent
which
steals
into
the
closest
thickets
do
we
ask
that
he
should
drive
our
flocks
the
same
compliant
genius
grants
him
the
requisite
size
intelligence
energy
and
vigilance
do
we
intend
him
to
watch
and
defend
our
house
his
head
becomes
round
and
monstrous
in
order
that
his
jaws
may
be
more
powerful
more
formidable
and
more
tenacious
are
we
taking
him
to
the
south
his
hair
grows
shorter
and
lighter
so
that
he
may
faithfully
accompany
us
under
the
rays
of
a
hotter
sun
are
we
going
up
to
the
north
his
feet
grow
larger
the
better
to
tread
the
snow
his
fur
thickens
in
order
that
the
cold
may
not
compel
him
to
abandon
us
is
he
intended
only
for
us
to
play
with
to
amuse
the
leisure
of
our
eyes
to
adorn
or
enliven
the
home
he
clothes
himself
in
a
sovereign
grace
and
elegance
he
makes
himself
smaller
than
a
doll
to
sleep
on
our
knees
by
the
fireside
or
even
consents
should
our
fancy
demand
it
to
appear
a
little
ridiculous
to
please
us
you
shall
not
find
in
nature
immense
crucible
a
single
living
being
that
has
shown
a
like
suppleness
a
similar
abundance
of
forms
the
same
prodigious
faculty
of
accommodation
to
our
wishes
this
is
because
in
the
world
which
we
know
among
the
different
and
primitive
geniuses
that
preside
over
the
evolution
of
the
several
species
there
exists
not
one
excepting
that
of
the
dog
that
ever
gave
a
thought
to
the
presence
of
man
it
will
perhaps
be
said
that
we
have
been
able
to
transform
almost
as
profoundly
some
of
our
domestic
animals
our
hens
our
pigeons
our
ducks
our
cats
our
horses
our
rabbits
for
instance
yes
perhaps
although
such
transformations
are
not
comparable
with
those
undergone
by
the
dog
and
although
the
kind
of
service
which
these
animals
render
us
remains
so
to
speak
invariable
in
any
case
whether
this
impression
be
purely
imaginary
or
correspond
with
a
reality
it
does
not
appear
that
we
feel
in
these
transformations
the
same
unfailing
and
preventing
good
will
the
same
sagacious
and
exclusive
love
for
the
rest
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
dog
or
rather
the
inaccessible
genius
of
his
race
troubles
scarcely
at
all
about
us
and
that
we
have
merely
known
how
to
make
use
of
various
aptitudes
offered
by
the
abundant
chances
of
life
it
matters
not
as
we
know
nothing
of
the
substance
of
things
we
must
needs
cling
to
appearances
and
it
is
sweet
to
establish
that
at
least
in
appearance
there
is
on
the
planet
where
like
unacknowledged
kings
we
live
in
solitary
state
a
being
that
loves
us
however
the
case
may
stand
with
these
appearances
it
is
none
the
less
certain
that
in
the
aggregate
of
intelligent
creatures
that
have
rights
duties
a
mission
and
a
destiny
the
dog
is
a
really
privileged
animal
he
occupies
in
this
world
a
position
enviable
among
all
he
is
the
only
living
being
that
has
found
and
recognizes
an
indubitable
tangible
unexceptionable
and
definite
god
he
knows
to
what
to
devote
the
best
part
of
himself
he
knows
to
whom
above
him
to
give
himself
he
has
not
to
seek
for
a
perfect
superior
and
infinite
power
in
the
darkness
amid
successive
lies
hypotheses
and
dreams
that
power
is
there
before
him
and
he
moves
in
its
light
he
knows
the
supreme
duties
which
we
all
do
not
know
he
has
a
morality
which
surpasses
all
that
he
is
able
to
discover
in
himself
and
which
he
can
practise
without
scruple
and
without
fear
he
possesses
truth
in
its
fulness
he
has
a
certain
and
infinite
ideal
iv
and
it
was
thus
that
the
other
day
before
his
illness
i
saw
my
little
pelléas
sitting
at
the
foot
of
my
his
tail
carefully
folded
under
his
paws
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
the
better
to
question
me
at
once
attentive
and
tranquil
as
a
saint
should
be
in
the
presence
of
god
he
was
happy
with
the
happiness
which
we
perhaps
shall
never
know
since
it
sprang
from
the
smile
and
the
approval
of
a
life
incomparably
higher
than
his
own
he
was
there
studying
drinking
in
all
my
looks
and
he
replied
to
them
gravely
as
from
equal
to
equal
to
inform
me
no
doubt
that
at
least
through
the
eyes
the
most
immaterial
organ
that
transformed
into
affectionate
intelligence
the
light
which
we
enjoyed
he
knew
that
he
was
saying
to
me
all
that
love
should
say
and
when
i
saw
him
thus
young
ardent
and
believing
bringing
me
in
some
wise
from
the
depths
of
unwearied
nature
quite
fresh
news
of
life
and
trusting
and
wonderstruck
as
though
he
had
been
the
first
of
his
race
that
came
to
inaugurate
the
earth
and
as
though
we
were
still
in
the
first
days
of
the
world
existence
i
envied
the
gladness
of
his
certainty
compared
it
with
the
destiny
of
man
still
plunging
on
every
side
into
darkness
and
said
to
myself
that
the
dog
who
meets
with
a
good
master
is
the
happier
of
the
two
