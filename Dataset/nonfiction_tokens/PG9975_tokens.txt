this
diary
is
dedicated
in
affectionate
memory
of
his
father
the
late
preface
this
is
not
a
story
of
the

these
notes
jotted
down
at
odd
moments
in
a
diary
are
published
with
the
idea
of
recording
day
by
day
the
aspect
temper
mood
and
humor
of
paris
when
the
entire
manhood
of
france
responds
with
profound
spontaneous
patriotism
to
the
call
of
mobilization
in
defense
of
national
existence
france
is
herself
again
her
capital
during
this
supreme
trial
is
a
new
paris
the
like
of
which
after
the
present
crisis
is
over
will
probably
not
be
seen
again
by
any
one
now
living
as
a
youth
in
the
spring
of
i
witnessed
paris
partly
in
ruins
emerging
from
the
scourges
of
german
invasion
and
of
the
commune
as
a
correspondent
of
the
york
under
the
personal
direction
of
my
chief
james
gordon
bennett
for
whom
i
retain
a
friendship
and
admiration
for
his
sterling
rugged
qualities
of
a
true
american
and
a
masterly
journalist
it
was
my
good
fortune
during
fourteen
years
to
share
the
joys
and
charms
of
parisian
life
i
was
in
paris
during
the
throes
of
the
dreyfus
affair
when
at
the
call
of
the
late
whitelaw
reid
i
began
my
duties
as
resident
correspondent
of
the
york
i
saw
paris
suffer
the
winter
floods
of
whether
in
storm
or
in
sunshine
i
have
always
found
myself
among
friends
in
this
vivacious
center
of
humanity
intelligence
art
science
and
sentiment
where
our
countrymen
and
above
all
our
countrywomen
realize
that
they
have
a
second
home
with
a
finger
on
the
pulse
as
it
were
of
paris
i
have
sought
to
register
the
throbs
and
feelings
of
parisians
and
americans

war
days
august
this
war
comes
like
the
traditional
bolt
from
the
blue
i
had
made
arrangements
to
retire
from
active
journalism
and
relinquish
the
duties
of
paris
correspondent
of
the
york
which
i
had
fulfilled
for
sixteen
consecutive
years
in
reply
to
a
request
from
ogden
reid
i
had
expressed
willingness
to
remain
at
my
post
in
paris
until
the
early
autumn
inasmuch
as
a
quiet
summer
was
expected
spring
was
a
busy
time
for
newspaper
men
there
had
been
the
sensational
assassination
of
gaston
calmette
editor
of
the
by
mme
caillaux
wife
of
the
cabinet
minister
then
there
was
the
of
the
streets
of
paris
owing
to
the
effect
of
storms
on
the
thin
surface
left
by
the
underground
tunnelling
for
the
electric
tramways
and
for
the
new
metropolitan
tubes
the
big
prize
fight
between
jack
johnson
and
frank
moran
for
the
championship
of
the
world
followed
next
came
the
trial
of
mme
caillaux
and
her
acquittal
then
followed
the
newspaper
campaign
of
the
brothers
mm
paul
and
guy
de
cassagnac
against
german
newspaper
correspondents
in
paris
the
cassagnacs
demanded
that
certain
german
correspondents
should
quit
french
territory
within
hours
as
several
german
correspondents
were
members
of
the
association
of
the
foreign
press
of
which
i
happen
to
be
president
i
was
able
to
smooth
matters
over
a
little
although
my
personal
sympathies
were
strongly
with
the
cassagnacs
who
are
editors
of
especially
in
their
condemnation
of
the
severity
of
the
german
government
in
regard
to
hansi
the
alsatian
caricaturist
and
author
of
i
managed
with
the
help
of
some
of
my
russian
italian
english
and
spanish
colleagues
to
avoid
needless
duels
and
quarrels
between
french
and
german
journalists
finally
the
day
of
the
grand
prix
de
paris
brought
the
news
of
the
murder
at
sarajevo
of
the
heir
to
the
throne
my
friend
edward
schuler
was
despatched
by
the
associated
press
to
vienna
and
when
he
returned
i
readily
saw
from
the
state
of
feeling
that
he
described
as
existing
in
vienna
that
war
between
austria
and
servia
was
inevitable
and
that
unless
some
supreme
effort
should
be
made
for
peace
by
emperor
william
a
general
european
war
must
follow
wednesday
july
the
day
after
austria
declaration
of
war
against
servia
i
lunched
at
the
hotel
ritz
with
marshall
field
and
her
nephew
spencer
eddy
field
was
about
to
leave
paris
for
we
talked
about
the
probability
of
russia
being
forced
to
make
war
with
germany
i
warned
field
of
the
risk
she
would
run
in
going
to
and
in
the
event
of
mobilization
of
being
deprived
of
her
and
of
all
means
of
getting
away
at
that
time
no
one
seemed
to
think
that
war
really
would
break
out
field
finally
gave
up
her
plan
of
going
to
and
went
to
london
the
following
evening
maître
charles
philippe
of
the
paris
bar
and
a
french
railroad
engineer
who
had
built
many
of
the
turkish
and
servian
railroads
dined
with
me
they
both
felt
that
nothing
could
now
avert
war
between
france
and
germany
yesterday
july
a
sort
of
war
fever
permeated
the
air
a
cabinet
minister
assured
me
that
at
whatever
capital
there
was
the
slightest
hope
of
engaging
in
negotiations
and
compromise
at
that
very
point
the
mailed
fist
diplomacy
of
the
kaiser
william
dealt
an
unexpected
blow
there
seems
no
longer
any
hope
for
peace
because
it
is
evident
that
the
military
pretorian
guard
advisers
to
the
german
and
austrian
emperors
are
in
the
ascendency
and
they
want
war
very
well
they
will
have
it
remarked
the
veteran
french
statesman
georges
clemençeau
after
dinner
last
evening
i
happened
to
be
near
the
café
du
croissant
near
the
bourse
and
in
the
heart
of
the
newspaper
quarter
of
paris
suddenly
an
excited
crowd
collected
jaurès
has
been
assassinated
shouted
a
waiter
the
french
deputy
and
agitator
was
sitting
with
his
friends
at
a
table
near
an
open
window
in
the
café
a
young
frenchman
named
raoul
villain
son
of
a
clerk
of
the
civil
court
of
rheims
pushed
a
revolver
through
the
window
and
shot
jaurès
through
the
head
he
died
a
few
moments
later
the
murder
of
the
socialist
leader
would
in
ordinary
times
have
so
aroused
party
hatred
that
almost
civil
war
would
have
broken
out
in
paris
but
under
the
tremendous
patriotic
pressure
of
the
german
emperor
impending
onslaught
upon
france
the
whole
nation
is
united
as
one
man
as
arthur
meyer
editor
of
the
remarked
france
is
now
herself
again
not
since
a
hundred
years
has
the
world
seen
debout
at
four
this
afternoon
i
was
standing
on
the
place
de
la
bourse
when
the
mobilization
notices
were
posted
paris
seemed
electrified
all
cabs
were
immediately
taken
i
walked
to
the
place
de
and
rue
de
la
paix
to
note
the
effect
of
the
mobilization
call
upon
the
people
crowds
of
young
men
with
french
flags
promenaded
the
streets
shouting
vive
la
france
bevies
of
young
collected
at
the
open
windows
and
on
the
balconies
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
cheering
waving
their
handkerchiefs
at
the
youthful
patriots
and
throwing
down
upon
them
handfuls
of
flowers
and
garlands
that
had
decked
the
fronts
of
the
shops
the
crowd
was
not
particularly
noisy
or
boisterous
no
cries
of
on
to
berlin
or
down
with
the
germans
were
heard
the
shouts
that
predominated
were
simply
vive
la
france
vive
and
vive
one
or
two
british
flags
were
also
borne
along
beside
the
french
tricolor
i
cabled
the
following
message
to
ogden
reid
editor
of
the
york
tribune
new
york
private
for
reid
suggest
supreme
importance
event
hostilities
of
brussels
as

also
that
harry

london
is
open
any
propositions
coming
from
you
concerning
sharing
war
news

with
his
paper
according
best
military
information
be
useless
expense
sending
special
men
to
front
with
french
owing
absolute
rigid
censorship
barnard
i
based
this
suggestion
about
the
supreme
importance
of
brussels
because
it
has
for
years
been
an
open
secret
among
military
men
that
the
only
hope
of
the
famous
of
the
german
armies
being
successful
would
be
by
violating
belgian
neutrality
and
swarming
in
like
wasps
near
liége
and
namur
and
surprising
the
french
mobilization
by
sweeping
by
the
lines
of
forts
constructed
by
the
foremost
military
engineer
in
europe
the
late
belgian
general
de
brialmont
i
subsequently
received
a
cable
message
from
the
editor
of
the
expressing
the
wish
to
count
upon
my
services
during
the
present
crisis
to
this
i
promptly
agreed
august
this
is
the
first
day
of
mobilization
i
looked
out
of
the
window
of
my
apartment
at
number
rue
at
four
this
morning
already
the
streets
resounded
with
the
buzz
whirl
and
horns
of
speeding
along
the
boulevard
de
courcelles
and
the
excited
conversation
of
men
and
women
gathered
in
groups
on
the
sidewalks
it
was
warm
rather
cloudy
weather
thermometer
degrees
centigrade
with
light
southwesterly
breezes
my
servant
félicien
summoned
by
the
mobilization
notices
calling
out
the
reservists
was
getting
ready
to
join
his
regiment
the
dragoons
his
young
wife
and
child
had
arrived
the
day
before
from
brittany
my
housekeeper
sophie
who
was
born
in
and
came
to
paris
with
her
mother
when
a
girl
of
eight
is
in
great
anxiety
lest
she
be
expelled
owing
to
her
german
nationality
i
walked
to
the
chancellery
of
the
american
embassy
number
rue
de
chaillot
where
fifty
stranded
americans
were
vainly
asking
the
clerks
how
they
could
get
away
from
paris
and
how
they
could
have
their
letters
of
credit
cashed
three
stray
americans
drove
up
in
a
cab
i
took
the
cab
after
it
had
been
discharged
and
went
to
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
where
i
expected
to
find
our
ambassador
myron
herrick
viviani
the
president
of
the
council
of
ministers
and
minister
of
foreign
affairs
was
there
awaiting
the
arrival
of
baron
de
schoen
the
german
ambassador
who
had
made
an
appointment
for
eleven
it
was
now
eleven
and
his
german
excellency
had
not
yet
come
i
watched
the
arrival
of
the
cyr
cadets
at
the
gare
station
on
their
way
to
the
gare
de
these
young
french
west
pointers
are
sturdy
active
wiry
little
chaps
brimful
of
pluck
intelligence
and
determination
they
carried
their
bags
and
boxes
in
their
hands
and
their
overcoats
were
neatly
folded
fashion
from
the
right
shoulder
to
the
left
hip
then
came
a
couple
of
hundred
requisitioned
horses
led
by
cavalrymen
driving
by
the
invalides
i
noticed
about
five
hundred
requisitioned
automobiles
i
was
very
much
impressed
by
the
earnest
grave
determination
of
the
reservists
who
were
silently
rejoining
their
posts
some
of
them
were
accompanied
by
wives
sisters
or
sweethearts
who
concealed
their
tears
with
forced
smiles
now
and
then
groups
of
young
men
escorted
the
reservists
singing
the
marseillaise
and
waving
french
british
and
russian
flags
at
the
place
de
la
concorde
near
the
statue
of
strasbourg
was
a
procession
of
italians
who
had
offered
their
military
services
to
the
minister
of
war
in
spite
of
italy
obligation
to
the
triple
alliance
later
at
the
american
embassy
number
rue
françois
premier
i
found
ambassador
herrick
arranging
for
a
sort
of
relief
committee
of
americans
to
aid
and
regulate
the
situation
of
our
stranded
countrymen
and
women
here
there
are
about
three
thousand
who
want
to
get
home
but
who
are
unable
to
obtain
money
on
their
letters
of
credit
if
they
have
money
they
are
unable
to
find
trains
or
passenger
space
on
westward
bound
liners
herrick
showed
me
a
cablegram
from
the
state
department
at
washington
instructing
him
to
remain
at
his
post
until
his
successor
sharp
can
reach
paris
also
to
inform
thomas
nelson
page
american
ambassador
at
rome
to
cancel
his
leave
of
absence
and
stop
in
rome
even
if
italy
had
decided
to
remain
neutral
as
soon
as
the
german
and
ambassadors
quit
the
capital
herrick
will
be
placed
in
charge
of
all
the
german
and
subjects
left
behind
here
i
met
also
jusserand
french
ambassador
at
washington
who
intends
sailing
tuesday
for
new
york
jusserand
informed
me
that
official
news
had
reached
the
paris
ministry
of
the
interior
of
germany
violation
of
the
territory
of
luxemburg
the
independence
of
which
had
been
guaranteed
by
the
powers
including
of
course
prussia
by
the
treaty
of
london
in
jusserand
was
very
indignant
at
this
reckless
breach
of
international
law
at
the
suggestion
of
herrick
a
committee
of
americans
was
chosen
to
with
him
in
giving
such
information
and
advice
to
americans
in
paris
as
the
efforts
of
the
committee
to
ascertain
facts
and
conditions
may
justify
the
committee
think
there
is
no
cause
for
alarm
on
the
part
of
those
who
remain
in
the
city
for
the
present
and
that
americans
will
be
able
to
leave
at
some
later
date
if
any
desire
to
do
so
the
committee
will
endeavor
to
learn
what
can
be
done
in
securing
money
on
letters
of
credit
or
travelers
cheques
or
in
getting
means
of
transportation
to
such
places
as
they
may
desire
to
go

committee
includes

asked
me
to
convey
a
private
message
to
one
of
his
friends
but
as
the
telephone
service
was
interrupted
laurence
norton
the
ambassador
secretary
loaned
me
his
for
the
purpose
on
the
cour
la
reine
a
procession
of
young
men
escorting
reservists
and
bearing
a
french
flag
appeared
i
naturally
raised
my
hat
to
salute
the
colors
the
crowd
noticing
the
red
white
and
blue
cockades
on
the
hats
of
the
chauffeur
and
the
footman
mistook
me
for
the
american
ambassador
or
for
a
cabinet
minister
and
burst
into
frantic
cheers
in
the
german
quarter
near
the
rue
a
couple
of
german
socialists
who
were
so
imprudent
as
to
shout
bas
were
surrounded
by
angry
frenchmen
and
despite
an
attempt
of
the
police
to
protect
them
were
very
roughly
handled
a
german
shoemaker
who
attempted
to
charge
exaggerated
prices
for
boots
had

windows
smashed
and
his
stock
looted
by
an
infuriated
crowd
the
news
that
the
german
shops
were
being
attacked
soon
spread
and
youths
gathered
in
bands
going
from
one
shop
to
the
other
and
wrecking
them
in
the
course
of
a
few
moments
further
riots
occurred
near
the
gare
de
a
district
which
is
inhabited
by
a
large
number
of
germans
a
great
deal
of
damage
was
done
measures
were
taken
at
once
by
the
authorities
and
several
cavalry
detachments
were
called
to
the
aid
of
the
police
the
youths
were
quite
docile
on
the
whole
a
word
from
a
policeman
being
sufficient
to
turn
them
away
the
cavalry
too
only
made
a
few
charges
at
a
sharp
trot
and
were
received
with
hearty
cheers
policemen
and
municipal
guards
were
however
stationed
before

to
be
owned

responsible
parisians
may
be
said
to
have
remained
as
calm
as
they
have
been
all
through
this
critical
time
among
those
taking
part
in
wrecking
shops
were
few
people
older
than
seventeen
or
eighteen
already
the
familiar
aspect
of
the
parisian
street
crowd
has
changed
it
is
now
composed
almost
exclusively
of
men
either
too
young
or
too
old
for
military
service
and
of
women
and
children
most
of
the
younger
generation
have
already
left
to
join
corps
on
the
front
or
elsewhere
in
france
it
is
impossible
to
spend
more
than
a
few
minutes
in
the
streets
without
witnessing
scenes
which
speak
of
war
there
are
long
processions
of
vehicles
of
all
sorts
market
carts
lorries
furniture
vans
all
of
them
stocked
with
rifles
for
the
reserves
and
all
of
them
led

driven
by
soldiers
not
a
is
to
be

the
and
cabs
are
scarce
are
running
although
on
some
lines
the
service
is
reduced
considerably
in
spite
of
the
disorganization
of
traffic
the
majority
of
parisians
go
about
their
business
quietly
there
is
deep
confidence
in
the
national
cause
we
did
not
want
this
war
but
as
germany
has
begun
we
will
fight
and
germany
will
find
that
the
heart
of
france
is
in
a
war
for
freedom
is
an
expression
heard
on
all
sides
everywhere
there
are
touching
scenes
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
a
covered
with
dust
who
had
come
to
bid
farewell
to
his
family
was
seen
riding
through
the
city
as
he
rode
down
the
street
an
old
woman
stopped
him
and
said
do
your
best
they
killed
my
husband

young
soldier
stooped
from

with
a
brown
paper

consisting
of
cold

walked
off
to

his

by

his
young
wife
wept
as
if
félicien
like
all
the
reservists
restrained
his
emotions
i
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
said
that
i
would
surely
see
him
again
here
within
six
months
and
that
he
would
come
home
a
victor
do
be
afraid
of
that
sir
was
his
reply
and
away
he
went
i
watched
the
looting
of
the
maggi
milk
shops
near
the
place
des
ternes
the
marauders
were
youths
from
fifteen
to
eighteen
years
old
and
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
the
crimes
they
were
committing
the
maggi
is
no
longer
a
german
enterprise
and
the
stupid
acts
of
these
young
ruffians
can
only
have
the
effect
of
depriving
french
mothers
and
infants
of
milk
i
bought
a
bicycle
at
peugeot
in
the
avenue
of
the
grande
armée
because
it
is
hopeless
to
get
cabs
or
while
there
the
shop
was
requisitioned
by
an
officer
who
took
away
with
him
three
hundred
bicycles
for
the
army
the
aspect
of
the
main
thoroughfares
in
the
opéra
quarter
the
center
of
english
and
american
tourist
traffic
was
depressing
in
the
extreme
this
afternoon
all
the
shipping
offices
in
the
rue
scribe
closed
in
the
morning
the
rue
de
la
paix
is
never
very
brilliant
in
august
but
now
it
is
an
abode
of
desolation
nine
tenths
of
the
shops
have
their
shutters
up
and
the
jewelers
who
keep
open
have
withdrawn
all
their
stock
from
the
windows
many
of
the
closed
shops
on
the
boulevards
and
elsewhere
bear
placards
designed
to
protect
them
from
the
possible
attentions
of
the
mob
on
these
placards
are
such
texts
as
maison
française
or
even
maison
ultrafrançaise
on
the
café
de

is
the
following
announcement
in
several
places
the
proprietor
andré
millon
who
is
mayor
of
evecquemont
has
been
called
out
for
service
in
the
army
and
left
this
morning
similar
messages
written
in

are
to
be
seen
on
hundreds
of
shutters
steps
have
been
taken
at
the
american
embassy
to
supply
credentials
in
the
form
of
a
paper
of
nationality
to
citizens
of
the
united
states
which
will
make
it
possible
for
them
to
register
as
such
with
the
police
as
required
by
the
french
government
the
proposed
american
ambulance
has
been
organized
under
the
official
patronage
of
ambassador
herrick
and
the
auspices
of
the
american
hospital
of
paris
beginning
all
cafés
and
restaurants
will
be
closed
at
eight
in
the
evening
they
were
left
open
till
nine
yesterday
as
an
exceptional
measure
owing
to
the
fact
that
there
was
not
time
to
distribute
the
order
for
early
closing
by
eight
the
aspect
of
the
boulevards
last
night
was
the
completest
possible
contrast
to
what
was
seen
on
sunday
night
the
city
was
under
martial
law
and
the
police
showed
very
plainly
that
they
did
not
intend
to
be
trifled
with
instead
of
shouting
crowds
and
by
excited
youths
and
women
one
saw
only
a
few
citizens
walking
slowly
along
one
group
of
policemen
took
shelter
from
the
intermittent
showers
under
the
marquise
of
the
vaudeville
theater
and
other
detachments
were
in
readiness
at
corners
all
along
the
line
of
the
boulevards
which
were
dotted
with
isolated
policemen
no
one
was
allowed
to
loiter
to
wait
five
minutes
outside
a
house
was
to
court
investigation
and
possibly
arrest
there
was
no
sound
except
that
of
footfalls
and
a
low
murmur
of
conversation
it
was
the
first
night
of
war
stern
government
germany
officially
declared
war
upon
france
at
five
this
evening
the
notification
was
made
by
baron
von
schoen
the
german
ambassador
to
france
when
he
called
at
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
to
ask
for
his
passports
baron
von
schoen
declared
that
his
government
had
instructed
him
to
inform
the
government
of
the
republic
that
french
aviators
had
flown
over
belgium
and
that
other
french
aviators
had
flown
over
germany
and
dropped
bombs
as
far
as
nuremberg
he
added
that
this
constituted
an
act
of
aggression
and
violation
of
german
territory
viviani
listened
in
silence
to
baron
von
schoen
statement
and
when
the
german
ambassador
had
finished
replied
that
it
was
absolutely
false
that
french
aviators
had
flown
over
belgium
and
germany
and
had
dropped
bombs
immediately
after
this
interview
viviani
telegraphed
to
jules
cambon
french
ambassador
in
berlin
instructing
him
to
immediately
ask
for
his
passports
and
to
make
a
report
on
france
protest
against
the
violation
of
the
neutrality
of
luxemburg
and
the
ultimatum
sent
to
belgium
cambon
will
leave
berlin
since
acts
of
war
were
committed
by
german
troops
two
days
ago
the
delay
in
the
recall
of
the
german
ambassador
had
appeared
inexplicable
to
the
great
majority
of
french
people
to
whom
baron
von
schoen
appeared
to
be
decidedly
outstopping
his
welcome
the
ambassador
himself
seemed
conscious
of
this
feeling
for
not
only
did
he
take
care
to
proceed
to
the
quai
in
as
inconspicuous
a
manner
as
possible
but
he
also
applied
to
the
authorities
to
detail
a
policeman
to
accompany
him
in
his
automobile
baron
von
schoen
departure
from
paris
was
a
solemn
affair
he
left
the
embassy
last
after
a
vast
collection
of
luggage
had
gone
off
in
and
other
vehicles
a
few
minutes
before
ten
wearing
a
soft
felt
hat
and
black
frock
coat
adorned
with
the
rosette
of
the
legion
of
honor
and
carrying
a
rainproof
coat
over
his
arm
he
left
in
a
powerful
automobile
which
by
way
of
the
invalides
the
trocadero
and
the
boulevard
flandrin
conveyed
him
to
the
station
the
station
employés
and
the
police
on
duty
at
the
station
formed
a
silent
cordon
through
which
the
departing
ambassador
passed
with
downcast
eyes
not
a
word
was
spoken
as
the
baron
stood
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
platform
then
the
stationmaster
said
quietly
there
was
a
shrill
whistle
and
the
train
composed
of
five
coaches
and
three
goods
trucks
glided
slowly
out
of
the
station
august
we
are
now
in
the
third
day
of
mobilization
weather
slightly
cooler
degrees
centigrade
with
moderate
southwest
wind
at
seven
this
morning
i
went
with
sophie
to
the
registration
office
for
germans
alsatians
and
number
place
boulevard
periere
a
crowd
of
some
five
hundred
persons
men
women
and
children
were
waiting
at
the
doors
of
the
public
schoolroom
now
used
as
the
du
for
the
seventeenth
arrondissement
although
a
german
by
birth
sophie
is
french
at
heart
she
came
to
paris
when
only
eight
years
old
and
has
remained
here
ever
since
she
is
now
and
has
been
years
with
me
as
housekeeper
and
cook
all
her
german
relatives
are
dead
hers
is
a
hard
case
for
if
expelled
from
france
she
would
have
to
become
practically
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
fortunately
she
has
all
her
papers
in
order
and
can
show
that
she
has
nine
nephews
actually
in
the
french
army
i
made
a
statement
in
writing
for
her
to
this
effect
which
she
took
to
the
registration
office
but
she
had
to
wait
standing
without
shelter
from
eight
in
the
morning
to
six
at
night
after
carefully
scrutinizing
her
papers
the
officials
told
her
that
her
papers
must
go
for
inspection
to
the
prefecture
of
police
and
that
she
must
come
back
for
them
she
had
with
her
photographs
of
three
of
her
nephews
in
military
uniforms
one
of
these
nephews
had
received
a
decoration
during
the
morocco
campaign
for
saving
his
captain
life
during
an
engagement
i
managed
to
see
the
commissary
of
police
of
the
quarter
and
spoke
to
him
about
sophie
explaining
her
case
and
saying
that
as
she
was
such
a
splendid
cook
it
would
be
a
great
pity
if
paris
should
lose
her
services
the
commissary
smiled
and
said
it
will
be
all
right
sophie
will
be
allowed
to
remain
in
paris
i
profited
by
the
occasion
to
obtain
a
de
or
residence
permit
for
myself
the
commissary
after
noting
on
paper
my
personal
description
and
measuring
my
height
handed
me
the
precious
document
authorizing
me
to
reside
in
the
entrenched
camp
of
paris
these
papers
must
be
kept
on
person
ready
to
be
shown
whenever
called
for
outside
of
the
office
about
three
hundred
foreigners
including
emile
wauters
the
belgian
painter
and
several
americans
and
english
were
waiting
their
turn
to
get
into
the
office
i
congratulated
myself
on
having
a
journalist
card
that
had
enabled
me
to
get
in
before
the
others
some
of
whom
stood
waiting
for
six
hours
before
their
turn
came
this
is
an
instance
of
stupid
french
bureaucracy
or
it
would
have
been
very
easy
to
have
distributed
numbers
to
those
waiting
and
the
applicants
would
then
have
been
able
by
calculating
the
time
to
go
about
their
business
and
return
when
necessary
another
instance
of
this
fatal
of
french
officialdom
came
in
the
shape
of
a
summons
from
the
fiscal
office
of
vernon
where
i
have
a
little
country
place
on
the
seine
to
pay
the
sum
of
two
francs
which
is
the
annual
tax
for
a
float
i
had
there
for
boating
purposes
this
trivial
paper
coming
in
amidst
the
whirlpool
of
mobilization
displays
the
mentality
of
the
provincial
officials
after
doing
some
writing
i
went
on
my
new
bicycle
to
the
chancellery
of
the
united
states
embassy
and
saw
a
crowd
of
about
seventy
americans
on
the
sidewalk
awaiting
their
turn
to
obtain
identification
papers
i
met
here
bernard
schoninger
former
president
of
the
american
chamber
of
commerce
in
paris
the
news
of
the
outbreak
of
war
found
him
at
luchon
in
the
pyrenées
all
train
service
being
monopolized
for
the
troops
he
came
in
his
automobile
to
paris
a
distance
of
about
a
thousand
kilometers
all
went
smoothly
until
he
reached
tours
when
he
was
held
up
at
every
five
kilometers
by
guards
who
demanded
his
papers
chains
or
ropes
were
often
stretched
across
the
roads
schoninger
showed
the
guards
his
visiting
card
explained
who
he
was
and
said
that
he
was
going
to
paris
on
purpose
to
get
his
papers
the
authorities
were
very
civil
as
they
usually
are
to
all
americans
who
approach
them
politely
and
allowed
him
to
motor
to
neuilly
just
outside
the
fortifications
of
paris
i
proceeded
on
my
wheel
to
the
embassy
where
i
found
our
ambassador
very
busy
with
the
american
relief
committee
and
with
the
american
ambulance
people
several
americans
at
the
embassy
were
making
impractical
requests
as
for
instance
that
the
american
ambassador
demand
that
the
french
government
accept
the
passports
or
identification
papers
issued
by
the
american
embassy
here
in
lieu
of
de
if
the
french
government
accorded
this
favor
to
the
united
states
all
the
other
neutral
nations
would
require
the
same
privilege
and
thus
in
time
of
war
with
fighting
going
on
only
a
little
over
two
hundred
kilometers
from
paris
the
french
government
would
lose
direct
control
of
permission
for
foreigners
to
remain
in
the
capital
it
is
estimated
that
there
are
over
forty
thousand
americans
at
present
stranded
in
europe
hundred
of
them
being
in
paris
of
these
fifteen
hundred
are
without
present
means
the
embassy
is
literally
besieged
by
hundreds
of
these
unfortunate
travelers
there
were
so
many
of
them
and
their
demands
were
so
urgent
that
the
military
attaché
major
spencer
cosby
had
to
utilize
the
services
of
eight
american
army
officers
on
leave
to
form
a
sort
of

to

his
face
against

there
could
hardly
be

the
chamber
filled
in
complete
silence
the
whole
house
from
royalists
to
socialists
listened
standing
to
a
glowing
tribute
by
paul
deschanel
president
of
the
chamber
to
jaurès
over
whose
coffin
he
said
the
whole
of

was
united
there
are
no
more
adversaries
exclaimed
deschanel
with
a
voice
trembling
with
emotion
there
are
only
frenchmen
the
whole
house
as
one
man
raised
a
resounding
shout
of
vive
la
france
when
deschanel
concluded
there
was
a
pause
during
the
absence
of
viviani
the
premier
entered
pale
but
confident
amid
a
hurricane
of
cheers
and
read
amid
a
silence
broken
only
by
frenzied
shouts
of
vive
la
france
a
speech
detailing
the
whole
course
of
the
diplomatic
negotiations
in
which
he
placed
upon
germany
crushing
responsibility
for
the
catastrophe
which
has
overtaken
europe
the
chamber
before
rising
adopted
unanimously
without
discussion
a
whole
series
of
bills
making
provision
for
national
defense
and
the
maintenance
of
order
in
france
viviani
speech
was
interrupted
by
terrific
cheering
when
he
referred
to
the
attitude
adopted
by
the
british
and
belgian
governments
all
rose
to
face
the
diplomatic
tribune
cheering
again
and
again
viviani
last
phrase
we
are
without
reproach
we
shall
be
without
fear
swept
the
whole
chamber
off
its
feet
the
vast
hemicycle
was
a
compact
mass
of
cheering
deputies
all
waving
aloft
in
their
hands
papers
and
handkerchiefs
from
the
tribunes
of
the
public
gallery
shout
after
shout
went
up
at
the
foot
of
the
presidential
platform
the
usher
with
his
war
medals
on
his
breasts
was
seated
overcome
with
emotion
the
tears
coursing
down
his
cheeks
paris
is
back
in
the
days
of
the
curfew
and
at
eight
by
order
of
the
military
governor
of
paris
it
is
lights
out
on
the
boulevards
all
the
cafés
close
their
doors
the
underground
railway
ceases
running
and
policemen
and
sentinels
challenge
any
one
going
home
late
lest
he
should
be
a
german
spy
paris
is
no
longer
ville
it
is
a
sad
and
gloomy
city
where
men
and
women
go
about
with
solemn
anxious
faces
and
every
conversation
seems
to
begin
and
end
with
the
dreadful
word
war
there
is
no
more
rioting
in
the
streets
the
bands
of
young
blackguards
who
went
about
pillaging
the
shops
of
inoffensive
citizens
have
been
cleared
from
the
streets
and
demonstrations
of
every
kind
are
strictly
forbidden
so
far
is
this
carried
that
a
cab
was
stopped
at
the
madeleine
and
a
policeman
ordered
the
cab
driver
to
take
the
little
french
flag
out
of
the
horse
collar
in
the
evening
the
city
is
wrapped
in
a
silence
which
makes
it
difficult
to
realize
that
one
is
in
the
capital
of
a
great
commercial
center
the
smallest
of
provincial
villages
would
seem
lively
compared
with
the
boulevards
last
night
but
for
large
numbers
of
policemen
and
occasional
military
patrols
the
streets
were
practically
deserted
there
is
however
nothing
for
the
police
to
do
for
the
sternly
worded
announcement
that
disturbers
of
the
peace
would
be
had
the
instant
effect
of
putting
a
stop
to
any
noisy
demonstrations
let
alone
any
attempts
at
pillage
policemen
can
be
seen
sitting
about
on
doorsteps
or
leaning
against
trees
parisians
are
already
going
through
a
small
revival
of
what
they
did
during
the
siege
of
they
are
lining
up
at
regular
hours
outside
provision
shops
and
waiting
their
turn
to
be
served
many
large
groceries
are
open
only
from
nine
to
eleven
in
the
morning
and
from
three
to
five
in
the
afternoon
not
because
there
is
any
scarcity
of
food
but
on
account
of
lack
of
assistants
all
their
young
men
being
at
the
front
or
on
their
way
there
great
activity
is
already
being
shown
in
preparing
to
receive
wounded
soldiers
from
the
front
and
all
the
ambulance
and
nursing
societies
are
working
hand
in
hand
the
women
of
paris
are
being
enrolled
in
special
schools
where
they
will
be
taught
the
art
of
nursing
and
thousands
of
young
women
and
girls
in
the
provinces
have
promised
to
help
their
country
by
making
uniforms
and
bandages
others
will
look
after
the
children
of
widowers
who
have
gone
to

train
of
ready

to

the
medical
board
of
the
american
hospital
held
another
meeting
at
the
hospital
in
neuilly
to
consider
further
the
organization
of
the
hospital
for
wounded
soldiers
with
an
ambulance
service
which
it
is
proposed
to
offer
as
an
american
contribution
to
france
in
her
hour
of
trouble
just
how
extensive
this
medical
service
will
be
depends
upon
the
amount
of
money
that
will
be
obtained
from
americans
the
enterprise
was
given
its
first
impulse
at
a
meeting
of
the
board
of
governors
and
the
medical
board
of
the
american
hospital
held
on
monday
at
the
request
of
ambassador
herrick
it
is
intended
to
establish
at
first
a
hospital
of
one
hundred
or
two
hundred
beds
fully
equipped
to
care
for
wounded
french
soldiers
several
places
are
under
consideration
but
at
present
no
information
of
a
definite
character
can
be
given
on
this
subject
later
if
americans
are
sufficiently
generous
in
their
contributions
it
is
proposed
to
obtain
from
the
french
government
the
use
of
the
lycée
pasteur
in
neuilly
not
far
from
the
american
hospital
in
this
building
a
thousand
beds
could
be
placed
and
it
is
hoped
that
funds
will
be
available
to
undertake
this
larger
ambulance
service
meanwhile
the
american
hospital
at
neuilly
is
not
to
be
affected
in
any
way
by
this
emergency
undertaking
but
it
will
continue
its
work
for
americans
in
need
of
medical
attention
the
special
hospital
for
soldiers
is
to
be
an
american
offering
under
the
auspices
of
the
american
hospital
and
under
the
direction

board

it
is
odd
to
notice
the
martial
aspect
of
the
doorkeepers
and
ushers
at
the
war
office
their
moustaches
have
become
longer
and
fiercer
and
their
replies
to
most
trivial
questions
are
pronounced
with
an
air
of
impressive
mystery
at
the
war
office
i
met
louis

former
prime
minister
who
expressed
genuine
enthusiasm
at
the

of

afterwards
went
to

the

for

upwards
of

of

are
closed
and
on
both
sides
the
street
presents
a
long
gray
expanse
broken
only
at
intervals
of
forbidding
iron
shutters
it
is
not
here
however
that
one
must
look
for
the
effect
of
the
war
on
american
business
but
rather
along
the
avenue

streets
in

of

proposed
to

just
the

in

the

headquarters
are

the

on

are
open
in
spite
of
the
hardship
entailed
upon
american
firms
they
are
far
from
complaining
on
the
contrary
there
is
a
concerted
movement
among
american
business
men
at
this
time
to
assist
the
french
in
keeping
the
industrial
life
of
paris
going
as
normally
as
possible
during

at

paris
is
still
dark
and
silent
but
in
the
daytime
the
city
is
beginning
to
adapt
itself
to
the
new
state
of
things
many
places
from
which
the
men
have
been
called
away
to
serve
their
country
are
being
filled
by
women
women
are
becoming

and
there
is
talk
of
their
working
the
underground
railway
girl
clerks
are
taking
places
in

and
other

the
unusual
state
of
things
prevailing
in
paris
is
the
cause
of
many
picturesque
scenes
this
morning
there
was
an
unwonted
sight
of
a
hundred
cows
being
driven
by
herdsmen
of
rustic
appearance
along
the
boulevard
des
capucines
a
little
further
on
the
eye
was
arrested
by
a
brilliant
mass
of
red
and
blue
on
the
steps
of
the
madeleine
where
a
number
of
men
of
the
second
cuirassiers
were
attending
special
mass
the
cheerful
tone
which
prevails
among
the
people
in
the
street
is
very
noticeable
all
faces
are
smiling
and
give
the
impression
of
a
holiday
crowd
out
enjoying
themselves
at
the
national
fête
an
impression
which
is
reinforced
by
the
gay
display
of
bunting
in
most
of
the
streets
in
the
center
of
paris
a
remarkable
sight
is
the
rue
du
croissant
in
the
afternoon
at
the
time
when
the
evening
newspapers
are
printed
the
unusual
number
of
papers
sold
in
the
streets
has
brought
thousands
of
boys
girls
women
and
old
men
from
the
outlying
districts
of
the
city

replacing

there
are
thousands
of
them
eagerly
awaiting
the
appearance
of
the

other
papers
the
narrow
picturesque
old
street
is
one
seething
mass
of
human
beings
hundreds
also
wait
in
the
rue
montmartre
as
they
wait
they
pass
the
time
by
playing
cards
or

many
industries
are
severely
affected
owing
to
the
absence
of
men
one
of
them
is
the
laundry
industry
which
is
unable
to
deliver
washing
owing
to
the
want
of
vehicles
and
drivers
in
consequence
many
parisians
have
now
adopted
the
soft
collar
no
one
at
this
hour
pays
attention
to
questions
of
toilette
or
personal
elegance
however
no
one
dreams
of
complaining
of
lack
of
comfort
all
want
to
do
their
best
to
help
the
national
cause
in
any
way
they
can
the
warmth
of
patriotic
feeling
is
magnificent
already
it
is
proposed
to
name
streets
in
paris
after
samain
the
young
alsatian
who
was
shot
in
metz
for
french
sympathies
and
after
the
curé
of
the
frontier
village
who
was
murdered
by
german
soldiers
because
he
rang
his
church
bells
to
give
the
alarm
of
their
approach
never
did
a
nation
rise
to
repel
attack
with
a
deeper
resentment
or
a
more
vigorous
one
effect
of
the
war
has
been
to
anathematize
the
name
of
germany
the
villette
district
through
its
local
representatives
has
presented
a
petition
to
the
city
council
praying
that
the
name
rue
shall
be
changed
to
that
of
rue
jean
jaurès
in
honor
of
the
assassinated
socialist
leader
scenes
of
extraordinary
enthusiasm
marked
the
departure
of
the
fifth
regiment
of
line
from
the
pépinière
barracks
long
before
six
the
appointed
hour
of
departure
the
avenue
portalis
and
the
steps
of
the
church
of
du
roule
were
black
with
people
at
six
the
bugles
sounded
the
iron
gates
opened
and
the
regiment
with
fixed
bayonets
swung
out
into
the
road
amid
ringing
cheers
and
shouts
of
vive
la
france
as
the
passed
the
cheer
increased
in
volume
and
men
stood
with
bared
heads
and
waved
their
hats
in

disembarking
of
british
troops

has
begun
and
the
greatest
enthusiasm
is
reported
from
the
northern
departments
i
went
to
see
the
duc
de
loubet
this
morning
and
met
there
de
courcey
forbes
who
told
me
that
the
french
mobilization
was
working
like
two
days
ahead
of
scheduled
time
he
said
that
about
a
hundred
germans
and
austrians
had
been
arrested
as
spies
they
were
tried
by
court
martial
at
eleven
yesterday
morning
and
of
them
who
were
found
guilty
were
shot
at
vincennes
at
four
the
same
afternoon
it
subsequently
turned
out
that
these
spies
had
not
been
shot
after
all
but
had
been
imprisoned
and
kept
in
close
confinement
when
baron
schoen
left
the
german
embassy
in
paris
he
was
treated
with
great
courtesy
and
escorted
by
the
chef
de
protocol
william
martin
to
the
railway
station
where
he
was
provided
with
a
special
de
with
a
restaurant
car
upon
the
arrival
at
the
frontier
the
germans
actually
seized
and
confiscated
the
train
reports
of
french
families
returning
from
germany
show
that
not
only
individual
frenchmen
but
french
diplomatists
and
russian
diplomatists
have
been
greatly
insulted
in
germany
especially
in
berlin
and
munich
contrast
with
this
the
attitude
of
a
crowd
which
i
saw
watching
about
a
thousand
germans
and
austrians
tramp
to
a
railway
station
where
they
were
entrained
for
their
concentration
camp
they
marched
between
soldiers
with
fixed
bayonets
ready
to
protect
them
but
the
crowd
watched
them
almost
sympathetically
with
not
an
insult
not
a
jeer
the
mobilization
in
france
has
caused
an
extraordinary
increase
in
the
number
of
marriages
contracted
at
the
various
paris
town
halls
from
morning
till
night
the
mayors
and
their
assistants
have
been
kept
busy
uniting
couples
who
would
be
separated
the
same
day
or
the
next
when
the
husband
joined
his
regiment
at
the
bare
announcement
of
the
possibility
of
war
the
marriage
offices
at
the
town
halls
were
literally
taken
by
assault
as
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
arrangements
were
made
by
the
chief
officials
to
accept
the
minimum
of
documentary
proofs
of
identity
in
all
cases
where
the
bridegrooms
were
called
upon
to
serve
their
country
the
other
papers
required
by
the
law
will
be
put
in
later
the
statistics
of
the
first
five
days
of
the
mobilization
show
that
one
hundred
and
marriages
were
performed
a
day
as
against
the
ordinary
figure
of
one
hundred
and
ten
in
the
suburbs
the
increase
is
even
greater
and
a
notable
fact
both
in
paris
and
outside
is
that
the
largest
number
of
marriages
took
place
in
the
most
populous
districts
in
the
eleventh
arrondissement
the
ordinary
figures
were
trebled

until
august
i
was
with
an
american
journalist
who
has
an
apartment
in
the
rue
hardy
at
versailles
he
is
a
single
man
and
his
house
is
a
fairly
roomy
one
the
other
day
he
was
waited
upon
by
a
military
officer
who
told
him
that
sixty
thousand
soldiers
were
to
be
billeted
on
the
inhabitants
making
one
to
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
city
of
the
roi
soleil
they
would
need
some
part
of
his
house
which
by
the
way
was
formerly
the
domicile
of
louis
david
the
great
painter
of
napoleon
and
he
would
be
glad
if
he
could
make
arrangements
to
lodge
four
soldiers
my
friend
at
once
consented
and
out
of
the
five
rooms
he
has
kept
two
to
himself
in
the
other
three
are
billeted
a
cavalry
officer
and
four
soldiers
the
only
thing
the
american
has
had
to
complain
of
up
to
now
is
that
every
morning
at
six
the
officer
wakes
him
up
by
playing
the
pilgrims
chorus
from
tannhauser
on
the
piano
germans
are
still
found
in
strange
places
considering
the
fact
that
the
french
are
at
war
with
them
i
saw
one
man
ask
for
his
papers
at
the
gare
de
this
afternoon
where
with
incredible
assurance
he
was
watching
the
entraining
of
french
troops
he
was
led
away
between
two
policemen
and
ought
to
feel
thankful
that
the
crowd
did
not
get
hold
of
him
he
might
have
shared
the
same
fate
as
that
which
befell
one
of
his
imprudent
compatriots
last
sunday
at
clarendon
it
was
the
day
after
mobilization
had
been
declared
and
the
german
knew
that
he
must
leave
the
country
but
in
a
swaggering
mood
he
said
he
would
not
leave
until
he
had
killed
at
least
one
of
these
condemned
frenchmen
his
words
were
reported
and
he
fled
into
an
entry
and
made
his
way
into
an
adjoining
house
where
the
crowd
lost
sight
of
him
when
he
emerged
a
cavalry
escort
protected
him
against
the
mad
people
who
wanted
to
lynch
him
and
bundled
him
into
a
cab
he
had
been
very
badly
handled
and
his
face
was
streaming
with
blood
he
drove
away
as
fast
as
the
horse
could
gallop
but
bystanders
went
after
him
climbed
up
behind
at
the
rear
of
the
cab
and
shot
him
dead
through
the
little
window
foreigners
who
know
the
women
of
france
who
have
lived
in
the
country
have
always
given
them
a
very
high
place
as
wives
mothers
and
managers
but
they
merit
the
admiration
of
the
world
more
than
ever
i
have
seen
them
taking
farewell
of
their
husbands
sons
and
brothers
during
the
past
few
days
and
nothing
could
surpass
the
courage
with
which
they
have
sent
them
off
to
the
war
they
have
struggled
bravely
to
conceal
their
emotion
and
only
after
the
men
have
gone
have
the
women
given
their
feelings
free
play
an
american
lady
who
has
seen
some
of
these
departures
told
me
the
other
day
that
the
sight
of
the
children
clinging
to
their
fathers
hands
so
as
to
prevent
them
going
away
to
the
war
was
one
of
the
saddest
sights
she
had
ever
witnessed
august
seventh
day
of
mobilization
ideal
summer
weather
temperature
centigrade
with
light
westerly
breezes
the
moon
is
now
full
a
thing
for
the
british
fleet
in
search
of
german
ships
also
useful
for
french
military
operations
and
for
lighting
the
streets
of
paris
thereby
enabling
economy
in

the
news
of
the
capture
of
altkirch
in
alsace
by
the
french
troops
reached
paris
at
about
five
this
afternoon
it
spread
like
wildfire
through
the
city
and
a
rush
was
immediately
made
to
buy
the
special
editions
of
the
newspapers
announcing
the
victory
to
those
who
are
not
familiar
with
the
parisian
character
the
comparative
silence
with
which
the
news
was
received
came
as
a
surprise
there
was
no
enthusiastic
outbreak
of
popular
sentiment
no
cheering
no
throwing
into
the
air
of
hats
or
sticks
after
years
of
weary
waiting
the
tricolor
floated
over
an
alsatian
town
at
last
that
was
the
word
that
was
heard
on
every
side
the
moment
was
too
solemn
to
frenchmen
to
allow
them
to
say
more
the
existence
of
war
will
be
further
brought
home
to
parisians
on
monday
by
the
disappearance
of
the
morning
breakfast
rolls
in
consequence
of
the
great
number
of
bakers
now
serving
with
the
colors
it
has
been
decided
to
simplify
bread
making
in
paris
so
as
to
ensure
the
supply
being
regular
and
consequently
the
only
kinds
obtainable
after
will
be
those
known
as
and
the
regulation
of
the
milk
supply
is
being
rapidly
organized
those
households
in
which
milk
is
a
necessity
for
children
invalids
or
the
old
can
obtain
certificates
giving
them
the
preference
on
the
day
after
application
for
these
certificates
they
are
delivered
together
with
full
particulars
as
to
the
amount
quantity
price
and
place
of
purchase
the
position
of
other
food
supplies
is
excellent
the
only
difficulty
is
to
get
them
delivered
housekeepers
must
fetch
their
bread
and
milk
if
they
want
them
to
time
few
articles
of
food
have
reached
the
maximum
price
laid
down
for
them
by
the
authorities
fresh
vegetables
and
fruit
are
very
cheap
the
only
important
articles
which
the
shops
have
difficulty
in
supplying
are
sugar
condensed
milk
and
dried
cereals
during
the
past
week
about
three
thousand
papers
of
nationality
were
issued
at
the
american
and
some
sixteen
hundred
at
the
embassy
this
number
may
be
taken
as
approximately
coinciding
with
the
number
of
american
tourists
now
in
paris
as
virtually
all
of
these
had
to
secure
papers
of
nationality
in
order
to
register
with
the
police
regulations
are
still
very
strict
following
the
discovery
of
numerous
spies
in
and
about
paris
general
michel
has
issued
an
order
strictly
prohibiting
conversations
on
the
telephone
in
any
other
language
but
french
when
this
order
is
not
obeyed
the
communication
is
immediately
cut
off
august
eighth
day
of
mobilization
hot
summer
day
with
light
southwesterly
breezes
temperature
at
five
degrees
centigrade
this
may
be
regarded
as
the
first
sunday
of
the
war
last
sunday
was
a
day
of
rush
and
clamor
in
paris
all
shops
were
open
and
filled
with
eager
customers
the
streets
were
crammed
with
shouting
crowds
and
hurrying
vehicles
everything
was
forgotten
in
the
outburst
of
national
enthusiasm
in
the
afternoon
and
evening
the
city
was
the
scene
of
riots
and
pillage
paris
presented
a
strong
contrast
the
news
of
french
and
belgian
successes
at
the
front
had
cheered
the
hearts
of
parisians
and
in
spite
of
the
strange
aspect
of
the
boulevards
denuded
of
their
gay
terraces
and
of
most
of
the
ordinary
means
of
locomotion
the
city
had
something
of
a
holiday
aspect
about
it
in
the
afternoon
the
city
was
crowded
with
promenaders
dressed
in
sunday
garb
the
proportion
of
women
to
men
has
largely
increased
but
the
arrival
of
numerous
reservists
from
the
provinces
caused
paris
to
appear
temporarily
at
least
somewhat
less
empty
of
men
indeed
the
aspect
of
the
city
very
much
resembled
that
of
any
sunday
in
summer
when
the
city
is
normally
far
from
crowded
i
met
macalpin
of
the
who
said
to
me
i
took
a
walk
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
yesterday
afternoon
in
a
lonely
alley
i
was
stopped
by
three
cyclist
policemen
they
asked
for
my
papers
fortunately
i
had
with
me
my
passport
and
the
to
remain
issued
to
me
as
a
foreigner
if
i
had
happened
to
have
left
these
in
another
coat
i
should
have
been
arrested
the
policemen
told
me
those
were
their
orders
they
added
confidentially
that
they
were
looking
for
germans
after
this
i
saw
many
more
cyclists
on
the
same
errand
they
are
hunting
the
woods
systematically
because
many
germans
of
suspicious
character
have
taken
refuge
there
i
rang
up
a
friend
on
the
telephone
and
began
as
usual
is
that
you
i
was
immediately
told
by
the
girl
at
the
exchange
that
in
foreign
languages
was
not
permitted
you
speak
in
french
she
said
shall
cut
you
off
at
once
i
suppose
she
listened
to
what
we
were
saying
all
the
time
i
went
into
a
to
send
a
telegram
to
my
wife
must
get
it
authorized
at
a
police
office
i
was
told
not
the
simplest
private
message
can
be
accepted
until
it
has
passed
the
censor
no
one
is
to
be
allowed
from
now
on
to
have
a
complete
wireless
installation
in
paris
many
people
have
set
up
instruments
some
for
amusement
some
it
appears
for
sinister
purposes
no
one
may
send
messages
now
though
they
are
allowed
to
keep
their
receivers
in
order
to
hear
the
messages
which
come
through
from
russia
the
eiffel
tower
station
it
is
explained
needs
dead
silence
in
the
air
it
was
even
announced
two
days
ago
that
no
one
would
be
allowed
to
pass
in
or
out
of
paris
between
six
at
night
and
six
in
the
morning
but
this
caused
such
inconvenience
to
so
many
people
that
the
military
governor
of
paris
was
asked
by
the
police
to
rescind
his
order
which
he
at
once
did
the
tenors
and
baritones
and
sopranos
of
the
opéra
and
other
theaters
are
going
round
singing
in
the
courtyards
for
the
benefit
of
the
red
cross
the
salon
is
turned
into
a
military
stable
where
the
pictures
hung
horses
are
munching
their
hay
the
comédie

is
to
become
a

nursery
for

in
the
absence
of
their

are
obliged
to
go
out
to

herrick
told
me
this
afternoon
that
a
few
days
ago
the
telegraph
office
refused
his
cipher
cables
to
washington
the
ambassador
at
once
protested
at
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
where
the
minister
doumergue
forthwith
gave
orders
authorizing
the
telegraph
office
to
accept
his
cipher
messages
the
austrian
ambassador
who
is
still
here
is
not
permitted
to
communicate
by
cipher
telegrams
with
his
government
this
is
quite
natural

depicted
on
all

this
morning
is
anxious
but
confident
expectation
for
the
public
are
conscious
that
a
desperate
encounter
between
two
millions
of
men
is
impending
in
belgium
and
on
the
border
from
liége
to
colmar
the
french
capital
is
at
the
present
moment
a
city
of
strange
contrasts
mothers
wives
sisters
and
brides
were
last
week
from
the
sorrow
of
parting
now
these
same
women
have
decorated
their
windows
with
bunting
and
have
no
thought
other
than
of
working
as
best
they
may
to
help
the
national
cause
in
the
streets
the
shrill
voices
of
children
pipe
the
latest

from
the
front

grim
details
of
the
war
all
prisoners
charged
with
light
offenses

been
allowed

themselves
the
central
prison
of
fresnes
which
ten
days
ago
contained
nine
hundred
criminals
has
now
only
two
hundred
and
fifty
left
and
all
the
time
paris
lives
an
humdrum
life
makes
the
best
of
everything
and
never
complains
day
by
day
the
aspect
of
the
streets
becomes
more
normal
for
the
reason
that
more
and
more
vehicles
are
freed
from
military
service
and
can
now
resume
their
ordinary
duties
of
transporting

me
that
two

after

a

took
place
near

in
the

and
a

arthur

manager
of
the

zinia
brozia
of
the
opéra
comique
who
remains
in
paris
was
also
of
our
party
all
sorts
of
war
rumors
were
current
but
as
messimy
the
minister
of
war
has
given
to
arthur
meyer
the
assurance
that
while
the
news
given
out
might
not
be
the
news
it
would
nevertheless
be
invariably
confidence
in
the
official
communications
to
the
press
which
are
the
only
authentic
source
of
war
news
is
unshaken
the
french
ministry
of
war
in
its
official
of
the
military
situation
issued
at
this
evening
states
that
the
french
troops
are
in
contact
with
the
enemy
along
almost
the
entire
front
the
only
fighting
that
has
taken
place
however
has
been
engagements
between
the
outposts
in
which
the
french
soldiers
everywhere
showed
irresistible
courage
and
ardor
a
uhlan
who
was
captured
near

on

was
found
to
be
the

of

with

at
the

several
members
of
the
club
had
just
arrived
from
various
one
of
them
who
came
from
said
that
he
was
hours
en
route
the
trains
stop
at
every
station
so
that
they
have
uniform
speed
thus
rendering
accidents
almost
out
of
the
question
only
tickets
are
sold
but
these
admit
to
all
places
it
seems
certain
that
the
first
part
of
the
german
plan
namely
to
come
with
a
overwhelming
crash
through
belgium
via
liége
and
namur
has
failed
but
the
battle
of
millions
along
the
vast
front
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
between
liége
and
verdun
has
opened
and
the
opposing
armies
are
in
touch
with
each
other
every
one
in
paris
has
confidence
in
the
final
result
there
is
news
of
stupendous
importance
in
the
official
announcement
that
germany
is
employing
the
bulk
of
her
army
corps
against
france
and
belgium
between
liége
and
luxemburg
the
disappearance
of
the
german
first
line
troops
from
the
russian
frontier
is
now
explained
by
flinging
this
immense
force
upon
france
germany
gains
an
advantage
of
numbers
how
will
she
use
it
paris
seems
to
have
seen
very
little
after
all
of
the
mobilization
most
people
may
have
seen
an
odd
regiment
pass
or
perhaps
numbers
of
horses
obviously
requisitioned
but
they
realize
none
of
the
feverish
bustle
of
the
mobilization
centers
versailles
relieves
paris
of
all
this
and
versailles
since
the
first
day
of
august
has
been
amazing
the
broad
avenues
of
the
sleepy
old
town
have
been
packed
from
side
to
side
with
men
in
uniform
men
only
partly
in
uniform
or
men
carrying
their
uniforms
under
their
arm
at
the
first
glance
there
seemed
nothing
but
confusion
but
the
appearance
was
misleading
for
at
the
chantiers

of
troops

have
been
despatched
taking
the

of

to

on

at
versailles
one
realizes
very
fully
that
france
is
at

for
there
are
lines
and

of

awaiting
teams
and

hundreds
upon
hundreds
of

made
some
valuable
mental
and
written
notes
of
what
she
has
seen
in
paris
she
is
about
to
leave
for
england
so
sure
were
the
germans
of
advancing
rapidly
into
france
that
they
had
decided
to
complete
their
mobilization
on
french
territory
according
to
the
an
alsatian
doctor
who
came
to
france
on
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
had
been
ordered
to
join
the
german
army
at
verdun
on
the
third
day
of
mobilization
a
german
tailor
living
in
paris
had
instructions
to
join
at
rheims
on
the
thirteenth
day
although
the
early
closing
hour
of
all
cafés
and
restaurants
causes
some
inconvenience
it
is
being
taken
in
good
part
by
parisians
it
has
not
the
slightest
effect
on
the
habits
of
the
city
as
far
as
keeping
late
hours
is
concerned
no
power
on
earth
could
make
the
parisian
go
to
bed
at
nine
people
can
not
spend
their
evenings
in
the
cafés
so
they
spend
them
either
strolling
or
sitting
about
in
the
streets
smoking
and
chatting
for
hours
but
the
new
closing
hour
has
had
the
effect
expected
by
the
authorities
it
has
made
paris
the
most
orderly
city
in
the
world
the
police
are
however
kept
very
busy
for
the
regulation
as
to
carrying
papers
is
being
rigorously
enforced
and
the
belated
pedestrian
is
invariably
challenged
by
a
cavalry
patrol
or
by
the
ordinary
police
if
his
answers
are
unsatisfactory
he
undergoes
a
more
searching
examination
at
the
police
station
paris
has
become
a
paradise
for
cyclists
owing
to
the
lack
of
transportation
facilities
hundreds
of
parisians
have
taken
to
using
bicycles
as
a
practical
mode
of
locomotion
and
the
city
now
swarms
with
them
this
state
of
things
is
not
however
likely
to
last
very
long
for
every
day
brings
more
vehicles
back
to
the
capital
and
every
day
brings
a
further
step
towards
a
more
normal
situation
some
cars
requisitioned
will
hardly
be
returned
as
is
evidenced
by
the
experience
of
julia
newell
and
her
sister
miss
josephine
pomeroy
two
americans
just
returned
to
paris
before
the
war
broke
out
miss
pomeroy
left
frankfort
by

but
in
passing
through
metz
her
machine
was
confiscated
by
the
germans
and
her
footman
and
chauffeur
who
were
frenchmen
were
put
into
prison
all
her
luggage
was
lost
no
attention
was
paid
to
her
protests
that
she

greater
military
activity
is
noticed
in
the
streets
than
for
some
days
past
many
movements
of
troops
took
place
all
day
and
long
convoys
of
the
ambulance
corps
including
several
complete
field
hospital
staffs
were
seen
driving
and
marching
through
the
city
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
within
the
last
few
days
large
bodies
of
the
territorial
forces
had
concentrated
in
the
environs
notably
at
versailles
from
whence
they
left
for
the
front
early
this
morning
certain
districts
of
paris
literally
swarmed
with
soldiers
of
the
territorial
reserve
although
most
of
them
are
married
men
and
fathers
they
display
as
fine
a
spirit
as
their
younger
comrades
they
may
perhaps
show
less
enthusiasm
but
that
they
are
quite
as
calm
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
a
number
of
them
spent
the
last
hours
before
their
departure
fishing
in
the
ourcq
canal
a
detachment
of
naval
reserves
has
been
brought
to
paris
to
assist
the
police
and
the
municipal
guards
in
assuring
order
in
the
capital
the
men
wear
the
uniform
of
and
correspond
to
the
marines
in
the
british
navy
they
will
be
placed
under
the
orders
of
the
prefect
of
police
beaumont
of
the
has
had
a
very
narrow
escape
from
being
shot
as
a
spy
he
is
a
naturalized
american
citizen
but
was
born
in
alsace
when
the
present
war
broke
out
he
started
in
a
to
the
front
without
the
necessary
passes
and
permits
he
circulated
about
and
obtained
good
and
useful
news
for
his
paper
the
other
day
however
he
was
brought
to
a
standstill
in
belgium
and
was
arrested
the
belgian
authorities
asked
at
the
french
headquarters
what
shall
we
do
with
him
the
reply
was
send
him
on
here
to
headquarters
and
if
he
proves
to
be
a
spy
he
will
be
and
shot
this
arose
from
the
confusion
of
names
it
seems
that
the
doings
of
a
german
spy
named
brémont
of
alsatian
birth
had
become
known
to
the
military
authorities
in
france
and
belgium
beaumont
stoutly
asserted
that
he
was
the
victim
of
mistaken
identity
and
only
after
very
great
difficulty
and
with
the
exceptional
efforts
of
herrick
and
of
sir
francis
bertie
the
british
ambassador
was
he
able
to
establish
his
true
identity
when
he
was
released
by
the
french
headquarter
staff
and
handed
over
to
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
arrivals
of

of

a

yesterday
the

with

huge
crowds
lined
the
streets
leading
from
the
gare
du

to
the
british
embassy
to
welcome
sir
john
french
commander
of
the
british

who
came
to
visit
president
poincaré
before
taking
command
of
his

at

rapidly
approached
the

in
the

i
could
get
a
glimpse
of
sir
john
in
his
khaki
uniform
his
firm
trim
appearance
and
his
clear
blue
eyes
genial
smile
and
sunburnt
face
made
an
excellent
impression
and
he
was
greeted
with
loud
cheers
he
had
a
long
talk
with
messimy
minister
of
war
i
am
having
a
very
busy
time
trying
to
obtain
permission
for
american
war
correspondents
to
accompany
the
french
armies
in
the
field
richard
harding
davis
and
gerald
morgan
have
arrived
in
london
on
the
from
new
york
to
act
as
war
correspondents
in
the
field
with
the
french
forces
as
president
of
the
association
of
the
foreign
press
and
as
paris
correspondent
of
the
york
i
made
special
applications
at
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
and
at
the
war
office
for
authority
for
them
to
act
as
war
correspondents
for
the
york
these
applications
were
endorsed
by
ambassador
herrick
who
also
did
everything
possible
to
secure
permission
for
them
to
take
the
field
the
official
regulations
for
war
correspondents
are
much
more
severe
however
than
those
enforced
during
the
japanese
and
turkish
wars
in
the
first
place
only
frenchmen
and
correspondents
of
one
of
the
belligerent
nationalities
that
is
to
say
french
british
russian
belgian
or
servian
are
allowed
to
act
as
war
correspondents
frenchmen
may
represent
foreign
papers
all
despatches
must
be
written
in
the
french
language
and
must
be
sent
by
the
military
post
and
only
after
having
been
formally
approved
by
the
military
censor
no
despatches
can
be
sent
by
wire
or
by
wireless
telegraphy
no
correspondent
can
circulate
in
the
zone
of
operations
unless
accompanied
by
an
officer
especially
designated
for
that
purpose
all
private
as
well
as
professional
correspondence
must
pass
through
the
hands
of
the
censor
war
correspondents
of
whatever
nationality
will
during
their
sojourn
with
the
army
be
subject
to
martial
law
and
if
they
infringe
regulations
by
trying
to
communicate
news
not
especially
authorized
by
the
official
censors
will
be
dealt
with
by
the
laws
of
espionage
in
war
time
these
are
merely
a
few
among
the
many
rigid
prescriptions
governing
war
correspondents
i
talked
with
several
editors
of
paris
papers
on
the
subject
notably
with
arthur
meyer
of
the
marquis
robert
de
flers
of
the
and
georges
clemençeau
of
the
they
one
and
all
expressed
the
opinion
that
war
correspondents
would
enjoy
exceptional
opportunities
enabling
them
to
get
mental
of
picturesque
events
and
to
acquire
valuable
information
for
writing
magazine
articles
or
books
but
that
from
a
newspaper
standpoint
there
would
be
insurmountable
difficulties
preventing
them
from
getting
their
news
to
market
that
is
to
say
in
getting
their
despatches
on
the
wires
for
their
respective
papers
however
herrick
is
doing
everything
he
can
to
obtain
all
possible
facilities
for
davis
and
for
morgan
almost
every
day
brings
some
fresh
measure
in
the
interest
of
the
public
yesterday
the
prefect
of
police
issued
an
order
forbidding
the
sale
of
absinthe
in
the
cafés
under
pain
of
immediate
closure
and
again
called
the
attention
of
motorists
to
the
regulations
which
they
are
daily
breaking
the
sanitary
authorities
too
have
their
hands
full
so
far
however
the
present
circumstances
have
had
no
influence
on
the
state
of
health
in
paris
the
weekly
bulletin
published
by
the
municipality
shows
that
the
death
and
disease
figures
are
quite
normal
bernard
schoninger
chairman
of
the
committee
which
has
recently
been
formed
by
the
american
chamber
of
commerce
in
paris
with
the
object
of
settling
difficult
questions
which
may
arise
in
commercial
relations
states
that
his
committee
is
collaborating
with
the
ladies
committee
founded
by
the
wife
of
the
american
ambassador
to
assist
wounded
soldiers
in
a
few
days
this
committee
collected
one
hundred
and
thousand
francs
his
own
committee
has
issued
an
appeal
to
all
chambers
of
commerce
in
the
united
states
and
he
trusts
that
considerable
funds
will
be
forthcoming
for
the
ambulance
corps
created
under
the
auspices
of
the
american
hospital
in
paris
the
minister
for
war
has
granted
the
use
of
the
lycée
pasteur
where
it
is
hoped
to
establish
an
ambulance
of
two
hundred
beds
which
may
later
be
increased
to
one
thousand
the
committee
has
also
taken
up
the
question
of
the
payment
of
customs
duties
on
american
imports
into
france
and
schoninger
states
that
he
has
met
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
that
the
french
customs
authorities
have
agreed
to
accept
guarantees
from
various
commercial
syndicates
instead
of
actual
immediate
cash
payments
this
will
obviate
difficulties
occasioned
by
the
refusal
of
french
banking
establishments
acting
under
the
terms
of
the
moratorium
in
handing
over

moving

off

made

fell
then
the

cantered
away
they
were
four

but
did
not

the
french
followed
up
resolutely
but
the
germans
kept
their
distance
when
the
dragoons
trotted
the
uhlans
trotted
too
now
the
former
would
gallop
across
a
bit
of

country
and
the
germans
would
gallop
away
just
as
quickly
evidently
they
were
making
for
shelter
soon
lieutenant

saw
that
they
were
trying

reach
a
wood
where
they
could
take
cover
no
time
was
to
be
lost
he
knew
that
if
they
got
there
they
would
escape
him
now
was
the
moment
to
unchain
the
ardor
of
his
men
he
gave
the
orders
draw
swords
charge
the
seven
spurred
their
horses
and
fell
upon

the
shock
demoralized

immense
enthusiasm
not

have
they
landed

with

they

they
were
entrained

that
boulogne
was
full
of
british

they
marched
through
the
narrow
streets
of
the
city
wearing
their
khaki
uniforms
thousands
upon
thousands
of
them
roaring
as
they
pass
the
new
british
war
slogan
are

then
came
an
irish
regiment
with
their
brown
jolly
faces
beaming
with
fun
and
singing

long
way
to
tipperary
it

the

throw

to
these
stalwart
british

as
soon
as

is
given
bevies
of
smiling
lasses
surround

there
would
be

if
they

witness
the
reception
highland
regiments
wearing

have
stupendous
success
with
the
blushing
young
women
of
france
from
the
seat
of
war
in
belgium
and
also
in
the
north
sea
the
same
awful
silence
continues
and
parisians
manifest
growing
impatience
for
the
inevitable
great
battle
i
went
to
the
ministry
of
war
with
and
mme
picard
but
no
news
of
military
importance
was
communicated
august
eighteenth
day
of
mobilization
fine
summer
weather
with
light
northerly
wind
temperature
at
five
degrees
centigrade
absolute
silence
concerning
military
movements
in
belgium
no
official
communication
was
made
at
the
ministry
of
war
parisians
feel
that
momentous
events
are
about
to
take
place
but
look
forward
with
calm
confidence
i
called
upon
my
old
friend
rené
baschet
manager
of
the
which
is
the
only
illustrated
weekly
paper
in
france
to
continue
its
issue
i
hastened
to
tell
baschet
that
i
had
received
a
private
telegram
from
rome
announcing
that
the
pope
was
so
ill
that
his
physicians
and
above
all
monseigneur
zampini
did
not
think
that
his
holiness
could
live
through
the
night
baschet
paid
genuine
tribute
to
lord
kitchener
instructions
to
every
soldier
of
the
british
expeditionary
forces
and
said
that
the
british
war
minister
showed
himself
at
once
heroic
and
hygienic
and
cited
the
passage
you
may
find
temptations
both
in
wine
and
women
you
must
entirely
resist
both
temptations
and
while
treating
all
women
with
perfect
courtesy
you
should
avoid
any
intimacy
at
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
i
met
jules
cambon
french
ambassador
at
berlin
who
after
being
treated
discourteously
by
the
germans
and
dealt
with
practically
as
a
prisoner
reached
paris
by
way
of
denmark
and
england
it
would
have
been
indiscreet
to
ask
jules
cambon
to
disclose
diplomatic
secrets
but
after
conversing
with
persons
who
accompanied
him
it
seems
certain
that
there
had
been
complete
understanding
between
germany
and
austria
about
the
sending
of
ultimatum
to
servia
it
is
true
that
german
diplomacy
had
not
accepted
the
exact
terms
of
the
ultimatum
communicated
to
servia
on
july
and
had
asked
for
certain
modifications
in
the
text
which
austria
refused
to
make
cambon
drew
an
important
distinction
between
german
and
the
german
the
former
were
willing
only
to
go
so
far
as
a
war
while
the
latter
seized
the
opportunity
to
the
war
and
to
attack
france
the
discussion
lasted
two
or
three
days
and
the
military
caste
receiving
the
strong
personal
encouragement
and
support
of
emperor
william
became
omnipotent
and
from
that
moment
war
was
inevitable
in
regard
to
france
germany
constantly
repeated
the
formula
put
strong
pressure
upon
russia
your
ally
to
prevent
her
from
helping
the
servians
to
this
france
replied
very
good
but
you
yourself
should
put
strong
pressure
upon
austria
your
ally
to
prevent
her
from
provoking
a
catastrophe
to
this
germany
rejoined
ah
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
thus
it
was
in
this
that
the
diplomatic
conversation
continued
which
under
the
circumstances
and
especially
owing
to
the
attitude
of
emperor
william
could
end
in
nothing
else
but
war
august

good
news
of

parisians

the

of

where
the

office
pégoud
inventor
of

the

who
was
being
congratulated
by
messimy
minister
of

own
having
been
riddled
through

wings
by
bullets
and
two
shells
when
he
was
making
a
raid
of
one
hundred
and
eighty
miles
into
german
territory
he
naturally
did
not
tell
me
he
went
but
simply
said
he
crossed
the
rhine
with
an
official
observer
and
blew
up
by
means
of
bombs
two
german
convoys
captain
fink
he
stated
destroyed
the
frascati
airship
shed
near
metz
where
there
was
a
zeppelin
which
was
wrecked
he
also
destroyed
three
taube
aeroplanes
which
were
also
in
the
shed
general
bonnal
formerly
professor
of
strategy
at
the
ecole
militaire
says
the
greatest
piece
of
good
fortune
for
france
that
can
be
expected
is
that
emperor
william
will
take
personal
command
of
all
the
german
armies
this
is
now
an
accomplished
fact
and
it
gives
us
all
immense
encouragement

most
people
however
were
profoundly
indifferent
to

thousands
of
foreign
volunteers
assembled
on
the
esplanade

invalides
this
morning
to
offer
their
services
for
the
war
these
young
foreigners
are
mostly
strong
active
youths
and
have
all
received
more
or
less
military
training
they
marched
through
the
streets
in
detachments
of
from
two
to
six
hundred
grouped
together
according
to
nationalities
bearing
french
flags
alongside
flags

were

was

reported
as
having

shot
as
a
spy
for
arranging

on
the

of
his

to
interfere
with

was
tried
today
not
by
court
martial
but
by
a
civil
judge
tortat
to
whom
the
court
martial
had
referred
the
matter
for
further
evidence
it
appears
that
geissler
had
been
denounced
on
insufficient
grounds
by
a
clerk
in
his
employment
his
innocence
was
established
this
morning
and
he
was
released
from
the
santé
prison
and
handed
over
to
the
military
authorities
who
will
probably
let
the
matter
drop

all
that
i
can
say
to
you
is
that

i

made
by

he
stepped

on

this

after

of

of

remarkable
impressive
silence
prevails
everywhere
if
people
speak
it
seems
to
be
in
a
whisper
never
before
was
paris
so
full
of
all
driving
hurriedly
hither
and
thither
bearing
nurses
or
red
cross
attendants
but
never
a
wounded
the
whole
of

the

stations
have
an
unusual
appearance
with

a

of
barrier

the
calm
confident
silent

expectation

well
for
the
future

vividly
contrasts
with
the
noisy

my
friend
laurence
jerrold
chief
paris
correspondent
of

spoke
of
the
stories
showing
the
amazing
ignorance
in
which
german
officers
have
been
kept
regarding
the
situation
jerrold
told
me
that
a
relative
of
his
who
is
a
french

yesterday
two
prussian
lieutenants
who
as
prisoners
of

were
being
taken
around
paris
to
a
town
in
western
france
both
spoke
french
perfectly
at
juvisy
station
where
the
train
stopped
they
said
to
the
french
officer
of
course
we
know
why
you
are
taking
us
around
paris

not
paris
paris

in

state
of
revolution
and
you
do
want
us

going

prussian
officers
persisted
that
paris
was
in

italian
army
had
already
crossed

all
the
newspapers

could
find
and

aghast

the

the

announcing
that
three
of

great
popularity
not

at

abroad
and
is
a
warm
friend
of

he
has
also
a
keen
sense
of
humor
not
long
ago
a
distinguished
member
of
the
french
parliament
lunched
with
monseigneur
ferrata
and
remarked
how
is
it
that
the
church
requires
such
a
long
lapse
of
time
before
pronouncing
a
decree
of
nullity
of
marriage
well
replied
cardinal
ferrata
before
the
end
of
the
ten
years
delay
it
is
usually
found
that
of
the
dies
or
disappears
and
that
the
petition
consequently
is
no
longer
pressed
a
great
change
is
noticeable
in
the
paris
churches
they
have
been
more
crowded
since
the
war
than
for
many
years
past
i
entered
the
madeleine
and
found
to
my
surprise
an
unusually
large
proportion
of
men
among
the
congregation
most
of
them
were
reservists
called
to
arms
in
other
churches
the
congregations
were
almost
entirely
composed

children

to

crop
up

on

the

remain

some
of

are
very
hard
to
please
everything
possible
is
being
done
for
those
who
wish
to
return
home
and
money
when
necessary
is
advanced
to
them
for
the
purpose
but
they
strongly
object
to
waiting
in
line
for
their
turn
whether
at
the
embassy
the
consulate
or
at
the
transatlantic
company
where
owing
to
the
crowd
of
applicants
there
is
some
necessary
delay
in
attending

september
a
number
of
complications
have
arisen
by
discharged
servants
filing
statements
against
their
former
employers
denouncing
them
as
probable
spies
several
examples
of
this
have
already
occurred
with
prominent
american
ladies
who
permanently
reside
here
i
spoke
with
hennion
the
prefect
of
police
on
the
subject
and
he
said
that
such
malicious
accusations
and
he
showed
me
a
pile
of
denunciations
nearly
a
yard
high
were
never
acted
upon
unless
under
suspicious
one
of
herrick
callers
at
the
american
embassy
was
mme
henri
de
sinçay
a
of
general
logan
of
civil
war
fame
she
is
the
wife
of
a
french
army
officer
and
when
the
war
broke
out
was
living
in
a
chateau
near
liege
she
fled
to
brussels
with
her
child
and
then
leaving
the
latter
there
with
her
came
to
paris
to
say
to
her
husband
who
is
attached
to
the
aviation
corps
near
versailles
now
mme
de
sinçay
can
not
return
to
her
child
but
she
is
not
worrying
over
the
situation
and
has
offered
her
services
to
the
american
ambulance
here
in
paris
the
earnest
practical
way
in
which
general
victor
constant
michel
military
governor
of
paris
carries
out
his
work
is
admirable
general
michel
has
quietly
despatched
large
numbers
of
the
unruly
youths
of
belleville
montmartre
and
montparnasse
known
as
the
apaches
to
the
country
in
small
gangs
to
reap
the
wheat
harvest
and
he
also
employs
them
in
the
government
cartridge
and
ammunition
factories
in
paris
they
have
completely
vanished
from
sight
the
prohibition
of
the
drinking
and
sale
of
absinthe
not
only
in
paris
but
throughout
france
was
also
due
to
the
foresight
of
the
military
governor
general
michel
although
a
rigid
disciplinarian
and
a
masterful
organizer
is
extremely
affable
and
agreeable
he
was
born
at
auteuil
in
and
after
graduation
from
the
french
west
point
served
in
the
war
of
as
second
lieutenant
of
infantry
in
he
was
made
colonel
of
an
infantry
regiment
and
showed
such
proficiency
during
the
manoeuvers
that
he
became
in
he
was
made
in
he
is
member
of
the
supreme
war
council
and
in
was
awarded
the
high
distinction
of
grand
officer
of
the
legion
of

terrific

and

fighting
continues
on
the
sambre
and
meuse
the
french
attack
seems
to
have
been
repulsed
the
allies
remain
on
the
defensive
awaiting
further
german
attacks
the
losses
on
both
sides
are
terrible
some
days
yet
must
elapse
before
the
final
result
of
the
great
battle
can
be
known
meanwhile
paris
waits
with
patriotic
confidence
russian
victories
in
east
prussia
the
japanese
bombardment
of
in
the
advance
of
the
servians
and
the
increasing
probability
of
italy
claiming
eventually
her
territory
are
all
encouraging
factors
in
this
war
the
american
volunteers
mustered
at
their
recruiting
offices
in
the
rue
de
valais
and
marched
to
the
invalides
where
they
passed
the
french
medical
test
prior
to
enrolment
in
the
french
army
the
men
are
wonderfully
fit
and
their
splendid
muscular
wiry
physique
was
greatly
admired
as
they
marched
through
the
streets
out
of
the
two
hundred
present
only
one
was
not
passed
by
the
army
surgeons
and
even
he
was
not
definitely
refused
the
corps
will
proceed
to
the
gare
for
entrainment
they
will
be
sent
at
first
to
rouen
granger
a
young
frenchman
arrived
in
paris
from
new
york
where
he
left
his
wife
and
family
he
sailed
on
the
with
many
of
his
countrymen
coming
like
himself
to
join
the
colors
granger
tells
me
that
he
saw
near
lisieux
a
train
of
german
prisoners
mostly
cavalrymen
some
of
whom
had
been
wounded
by
lance
thrusts
they
seemed
resigned
to
their
fate
without
enthusiasm
and
on
the
whole
rather
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
being
confined
and
fed
in
france
instead
of
remaining
at
the
front
they
said
that
they
had
no
idea
that
england
and
belgium
were
fighting
against
them
until
they
crossed
swords
with
the
belgian
cavalry
which
they
at
first
supposed
were
french
august
this
is
the
day
of
the
war
another
warm
sunny
day
with
northwesterly
breezes

at
five
degrees

better
news
from
the
front
this
morning
the
great
battle
that
has
been
raging
for
three
days
from
mons
to
virton
during
which
the
french
and
british
attacks
were
repulsed
has
been
resumed
and
renewed
german
attacks
have
been
checked
considerable
anxiety
as
to
the
result
nevertheless
prevails
my
concierge
baptiste
for
instance
shakes
his
head
in
a
mournful
way
and
says
ah
monsieur
there
is
already
terrible
loss
of
life
my
who
left
luxemburg
three
weeks
ago
to
join
his
reserve
regiment
in
france
is
without
a
cent
in
the
world
and
what
will
become
of
his
wife
and
two
little
children
the
lord
only
knows
their
little
farmhouse
with
all
their
belongings
has
been
burned
and
nothing
is
left
i
breakfasted
at
the
restaurant
champeaux
place
de
la
bourse
two
official
members
of
the
paris
stock
exchange
took
very
gloomy
views
of
the
situation
it
seems
however
that
the
french
rentes
maintain
their
quotation
of
francs
elmer
roberts
of
the
associated
press
and
hart
berg
sat
at
our
table
both
thought
that
the
war
would
be
much
longer
than
at
first
expected
and
would
depend
upon
how
long
germany
could
exist
owing
to
the
impossibility
of
obtaining
food
from
abroad
eight
months
said
berg
after
lunch
i
went
with
roberts
to
see
the
departure
of
the
first
contingent
of
american
volunteers
from
the
gare
these
youths
are
a
tall
stalwart
lot
marching
with
a
sort
of
cowboy
swing
they
were
not
in
uniform
but
wore
flannel
shirts
felt
hats
and
khaki
trousers
they
carried
a
big
american
flag
surmounted
with
a
huge
bouquet
of
roses
and
alongside
this
a
large
french
flag
they
were
loudly
cheered
as
they
were
entrained
for
rouen
where
they
will
be
drilled
into
effective
shape
i
met
edith
wharton
who
remains
in
paris
and
is
doing
good
work
with
her
or
which
with
thorne
she
has
organized
in
the
rue
vaneau
this
is
to
supply
work
to
unmarried

went
in
the
afternoon
to
see
madame

at

boulevard
haussmann
madame
waddington
makes
an
appeal
by
cable
to
the
york
calling
upon
all
american
women
and
men
to
aid
her
indigent
french
who
are
employed
in
making
garments
for
the
sick
and
wounded
for
which
they
receive
one
and
a
half
francs
thirty
cents
and
one
meal
for
a

work
madame
waddington
wore
a
gray
linen
gown
with
a
red
cross
and
was
working
away
very
merrily
distributing
materials
to
the
women
she
told
me
that
her
son
had
joined
the
colors
as
a
sergeant
in
an
infantry
reservist
regiment
and
was
at
the

the

paris
is

every

from

elsewhere
although
many
tourists
have
been

the
persons
in

off

america
on
the
the

no

has
no

representing

making
a

since

alexandre
millerand
is
an
illustrious
member
of
the
paris
bar
who
has
been
several
times
a
cabinet
minister
as
head
of
the
war
department
two
years
ago
he
did
more
than
any
living
frenchman
towards
the
reconstitution
of
true
in
the
french
army
he
prepared
the
way
for
the
three
years
service
and
reorganized
the
forces
of
the
nation
that
had
grown
rusty
during
the
decade
that
preceded
the
alarm
caused
by
the
german
emperor
at

it
is
quite
probable
that
millerand
will
prove
to
be
the

the
organizer
of

of
the

with

of

hands

deputy
for

upon
marcel

a
socialist
both
unified
socialists

the
government
is
assured
of
the
hearty
support
of
the
extreme
revolutionary
parties
mm
guesde
and
sembat
can
certainly
do
the
government
less
harm
the
cabinet
than
they
might
do
of
it
no
better
evidence
that
all
bitterness
of
political
parties
is
now
in
the
can
be
found
than
in
the
comment
of
the
reactionary
royalist
which
says
we
are
all
united
in
the
bonds
of
patriotism
in
face
of
the
common
enemy
we
place
absolute
confidence
in
the
men
who
have
assumed
a
task
the
success
of
which
means
the
salvation
of
france
and
the
triumph
of
civilization
georges

was
offered

accept
it
the

of
general
joseph
simon
galliéni
as
commander
of
the
army
of
paris
and
military
governor
in

is
resolved
to
put
paris
in
a
thoroughly
efficient
state
of
defence
and
to
be
ready
for
the
worst
possible
emergencies
general
michel
is
an
admirable
organizer
and
administrator
but
he
has
not
had
the
vast
military
experience
of
general
galliéni
who
is
by
the
way
a
warm
friend
and
comrade
of
the
former

august
general
galliéni
as
a
strategist
enjoys
the
same
high
reputation
as
the
general
joffre
he
was
born
on
april
at
in
the
department
of
the
haute
garonne
he
entered
the
military
academy
in
and
was
appointed

in

of

infantry
two
years
later
and
he
fought
with

regiment
through

of
since
then
he
has
distinguished
himself
in
tonkin
senegal
and
madagascar
everywhere
he
has
shown
exceptional
qualities
both
as
a
soldier

administrator
his
brilliant
career
finally
led
to
his
appointment
as
a
member
of

higher
council
of

in
acknowledgment

president
poincaré
confers
further
extraordinary
powers
upon
general
joffre
authorizing
him
to
exercise
the
almost
sovereign
right
of
promoting
officers
on
the
spot
just
as
napoleon
did
by
simply
naming
them
to
the
posts
where
he
thinks
they
may
be
most
useful
thus
general
joffre
can
make
a
captain
a
colonel
or
a
by
word
of
mouth
this
privilege
was
not
even
granted
by
napoleon
to
his
marshals
these
promotions
are
however
only
provisional
during
the
war
and
when
peace
is
made
must
be
ratified
by
parliament
this
renders
it
possible
to
replace
general
officers
killed
or
wounded
by
officers
selected
on
the
battlefield
and
above
all
enables
important
commands
to
be
filled
by
young
officers
who
give
proof
of
their
qualities
in
face
of
the
enemy
an
idea
of
the
infinite
tragedy
of
war
was
brought
home
to
many
parisians
by
a
visit
to
the
cirque
de
paris
where
hundred
belgian
refugees
men
women
and
children
have
been
provided
with
at
least
a
temporary
shelter
the
vast
building
where
so
many
famous
have
taken
place
is
now
completely
transformed
the
ring
has
been
cut
in
two
and
hundreds
of
fauteuils
have
been
placed
in
small
groups
so
arranged
as
to
form
substitutes
for
beds
the
boxes
have
been
reserved
for
the
many
women
with
infants
in
arms
hardly
were
they
installed
and
hardly
had
the
news
spread
in
paris
of
their
miserable
plight
than
hundreds
of
parisians
visited
the
cirque
de
paris
all
bringing
gifts
of
food
drink
or
clothing
it
was
a
pathetic
and
at
the
same
time
a
cheering
sight
to
watch
the
refugees
hungrily
eating
the
midday
meal
which
their

a
wounded
sergeant
of
a
highland
regiment
in
talking
yesterday
with
an
american
friend
of
mine
at
amiens
station
bitterly
denounced
the
german
practice
of
concealing
their
advance
by
driving
along
in
front
of
them
numbers
of
refugee
women
and
children
the
scottish
sergeant
said
our
battalion
was
badly
cut
up
we
were
using
our
machine
guns
to
repel
a
german
advance
suddenly
we
saw
a
lot
of
women
and
children
coming
along
the
road
towards
us
our
officers
ordered
us
to
cease
firing
the
refugees
came
pouring
through
our
lines
immediately
behind
them
however
were
the
german
riflemen
who
suddenly
opened
fire
on
us
at
short
range
with
terrible
effect
had
it
not
been
for
this
dastardly
trick
of
shoving
women
and
children
ahead
of
them
at
the
points
of
their
bayonets
we
might
have
wiped
out
this
german
rifle
battalion
that
attacked
us
but
instead
of
that
we
were
driven
back
damn
these
germans
with
these
words
the
scottish
sergeant
his
right
arm
shattered
from
shoulder
to
elbow
climbed
into
the
train
of
british
wounded
and
was
carried
off
towards
rouen
a
number
of
french
wounded
soldiers
from
the
northern
army
arrived
in
paris
during
the
night
and
were
sent
to
the
military
hospital
rue
des
récollets
to
the
hospital
of
and
to
a
hospital
installed
in
the
college
rollin
among
them
were
a
number
slightly
wounded
but
very
few
severely
their
spirit
seems
excellent
and
all
agree
that
few
were
killed
considering
the
number
of
wounded
all
promise
to
obey
orders
more
closely
when
they
are
well
and
back
in
the

line
and
not
to
be
too
rash
rashness
and
too
great
anxiety
to
get
at
the
foe
seem
indeed
to
have
been
the
cause

many
casualties
august
day
of
the

bright
clear
weather
with
northeasterly
breezes
temperature
at
five
degrees
centigrade
i
saw
in
the
rue
franklin
georges
clemençeau
the
veteran
demolisher
of
cabinets
and
former
prime
minister
who
in
his
youthful
days
was
a
mayor
of
the
eighteenth
arrondissement
of
paris
the
turbulent
montmartre
quarter
clemençeau
severely
criticizes
the
new
viviani
cabinet
viviani
said
he
asked
me
twice
to
form
part
of
it
i
declined
because
in
addition
to
personal
reasons
the
ministry
did
not
seem
to
me
to
realize
the
elements
of
power
and
action
required
by
this
war
having
this
opinion
it
would
not
be
fair
either
to
viviani
or
to
myself
to
enter
into
a
combination
where
i
should
have
to
assume
the
responsibility
for
acts
that
to
my
mind
would
not
adequately
meet
the
emergency
under
the
circumstances
there
are
only
three
ministers
that
count
for
anything
those
of
war
foreign
affairs
and
finance
clemençeau
said
there
must
be
something
wrong
with
the
mobilization
scheme
because
when
our
troops
were
outnumbered
at
the
front
there
were
great
quantities
of
young
officers
and
men
who
for
ten
days
had
been
awaiting
at
their
various
points
of
assembly
orders
to
join
their
corps
and
at
the
last
moment
were
told
to
go
home
on
the
other
hand
millerand
minister
of

has
visited
general
joffre
at
the
army
headquarters
and
returned
to

very
satisfied
with
the
situation
i
took
a
spin
in
an
automobile
to
versailles
and
thence
to
buc
with
its

aerodrome

about

that
wonderful
gymnast
of

there
is
verrier
and
here
driving
a

is
carpentier
whose
more
familiar
costume
is
a
pair
of
white
slips
and
a
pair
of
gloves
for
carpentier
has
been
mobilized
too
instead
of
making
thousands
of
dollars
this
month
by
his
fight
with
young
ahearn
and
possibly
other
matches
with
bombardier

and

is
on

of

at

he
is
attached
to

have

they
fly
off

on

to

the

a

flew

across

so
high

on

a

reached

and
in

they

running

hurriedly
putting

leather
coats

was
filled

the

were

see
that
they
were
all
right
but
it
was
a
false

after
all

although
a
close
lookout
was
kept
everywhere
between

and

were
craning

into

the

army
of

arrived
in
paris
at
four
this
afternoon
but
the
reason
for
his
visit
is
naturally
kept
secret
he
had
a
conference
at
the
ministry
of

with
millerand
he
called
for
a
few
moments
at

again
for

morning
refugees
from
belgium
and
northern
france
continue
to
pour
into
paris
but
the
authorities
having
had
time
to
organize
are
sending
them
on
with
very
little
delay
to
various
places
in
the
west
and
south
of
france
it
is
impossible
to
prevent
these
frightened
people
from
taking
refuge
in
paris
which
they
regard
as
a
place
of
safety
and
the
only
course
open
is
to
send
them
on
as
soon
as
possible
among
the
financial
victims
of
the
war
are
a
number
of
chinese
students
who
have
found
their
supplies
of
money
from
home
suddenly
cut
off
a
body
of
about
sixty
went
to
the
chinese
legation
in
the
rue
de
babylone
on
friday
evening
and
clamored
for
money
the
minister
liu
was
out
but
to
the
great
disgust
of
the
staff
the
students
invaded
the
and
kitchen
and
commandeered
the
dinner
which
was
being
prepared
for
the
minister
a
message
was
sent
to
his
excellency
who
dined
at
a
restaurant
meanwhile
the
students
having
dined
began
to
gamble
and
several
made
preparations
to
spend
the
night
in
the
legation
they
were
however
expelled
by
the
police
at
the
meeting
of
the
women
auxiliary
of
the
american
ambulance
at
the
embassy
this
afternoon
many
details
in
connection
with
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
the
hospital
in
the
lycée
pasteur
were
discussed
a
committee
was
appointed
for
the
special
purpose
of
supplying
with
clothing
such
wounded
soldiers
as
may
be
brought
to
the
hospital
it
was
announced
that
miss
matthews
will
succeed
miss
cameron
as
the
chairman
of
the
sewing
committee
the
latter
having
been
called
to
america
by
her
brother
illness
vanderbilt
has
offered
to
contribute
many
articles
needed
in
the
installation
of
the
hospital
particularly
such
things
as
window
curtains
and
other
furnishings
designed
to
make
the
institution
as
comfortable
as
possible
for
the
sufferers
for
just
four
weeks
now
the
american
government
has
been
advancing
money
to
citizens
in
need
of
it
at
the
embassy
and
still
the
stream
of
applicants
continues
in
about
the
same
proportions
as
ever
the
undiminishing
demand
for
funds
is
due
largely
to
the
fact
that
there
are
new
arrivals
in
the
city
every
day
but
major
cosby
who
is
in
charge
of
the
distribution
of
the
money
believes
that
with
the
departure
of
the
and
the
there
will
come
a
gradually
lessening
demand
for
assistance
so
far
about
five
hundred
persons
have
received
money
and
the
total
paid
out
for
the
four
weeks
is
francs
this
represents
about
one
hundred
and
francs
or
dollars
apiece
in
addition
to
the
government
fund
which
is
paid
only
to
persons
who
accept
it
as
a
loan
about
thousand
francs
raised
here
in
paris
has
been
given
outright
to
persons
who
for
various
reasons
could
not
be
assisted
out
of
the
government
fund
captain
brinton
has
also
paid
out
from
sixty
to
seventy
thousand
dollars
to
various
persons
upon
cable
orders
from
the
department
of
state
in
washington
this
represents
a
purely
business
transaction
as
the
money
has
first
been
deposited
with
the
government
by
friends
in
the
united
states
it
has
however
been
an
exceedingly
practical
means
of
helping
persons
who
otherwise
might
have
had
to
fall
back
on
the
relief

department
of

aisne
near
la
fère
guise
and
laon
on
the
road
to
paris
still
hangs
in
the
balance
it
seems
pretty
certain
that
the
french
armies
were
concentrated
too
far
to
the
east
the
temptation
to
enter
alsace
where
strong
force
is
needless
was
too
great
for
the
then
war
minister
messimy
to
withstand
france
is
paying
for
this
now
for
over
twenty
years
it
was
an
open
secret
among
military
authorities
that
the
main
german
attack
upon
france
would
burst
in
through
belgium
and
the
northern
departments
of
france
which
seem
to
have
been
left
without
adequate
fortifications
here
is
france
vulnerable
point
for
france
to
be
now
outnumbered
in
this
theater
of
the
war
is
strong
evidence
of
her
also
being
while
the
french
have
wasted
needless
troops
in
futile
excursions
beyond
the
vosges
and
in
the
ardennes
they
seem
to
have
been
blind
to
the
tremendous
concentration
of
german
fighting
strength
in
the
north
had
it
not
been
for
the
solid
heroic
resistance
of
the
british
army
under
sir
john
french
on
the
extreme
french
left
at
mons
and
cambrai
it
is
very
likely
that
the
french
would
have
sustained
a
crushing
defeat
that
the
french
should
be
outnumbered
on
the
lines
near
la
fère
seems
incomprehensible
and
requires
satisfactory
explanation
from
the
ministry
of

further
proof
of

were
thousands
of
parisians
promenading
the
streets
at
the
time
the
news
spread
like
but
no
panic
nor
even
undue
excitement
ensued
the
people
of
paris
are
totally
different
from
what
they
were
in
of
course
the
intention
of
these
aeroplane
of
whose
exploits
we
shall
probably
hear
a
great
deal
was
to
create
a
panic
and
demoralize
the
inhabitants
and
especially
to
terrify
women
and
children
this
utterly
failed
after
dropping
the
three
bombs
and
his
de
the
german
aeroplane
vanished
towards
the
east
it
seems
strange
that
the
flotillas

were
thus
caught

allowed

says
that

this

told
her
that
if

the

sharp
comment
is
elicited
by
an
incident
at
the
travellers
club
a
somewhat
select
resort
of
americans
english
and
other
foreigners
in
the
former
hotel
of
the
famous
beauty
of

madame
de
paíva
in
the
it
appears
that
a
wealthy
and
prominent
german
by
birth
but
naturalized
american
casually
remarked
one
day
at
the
club
that
he
did
not
intend
to
trouble
himself
to
get
a
de
permission
to
reside
in
paris
because
when
the
german
troops
arrived
in
the
capital
these
papers
would
no
longer
be
needed
was
told
that
if
he
persisted
in
expressing
such
views
offensive
to
the
members
of
the
club
and
to
the
hospitable
city
in
which
the
club
was
situated
his
resignation
would
be
forthwith
accepted
by
the
house
committee
paid
no
attention
to
the
warning
but
when
next
he
entered
the
club
a
few
days
after
the
incident
he
was
informed
that
his
name
had
been
stricken
from
the
list
of
members
adrien
mithouard
president
of
the
municipal
council
states
that
arrangements
were
made
months
ago
to
store
a
large
quantity
of
flour
in
the
city
so
as
to
provide
the
civilian
inhabitants
with
bread
this
flour
is
in
the
hands
of
the
military
authorities
who
have
a
considerably
larger
supply
than
was
originally
intended
and
are
still
adding
to
it
there
will
be
no
lack
of
coal
the
army
has
accumulated
enormous
quantities
and
the
gas
company
has
enough
coal
for
five
months
mithouard
also
says
he
recently
made
a
personal
investigation
of
the
water
supply
and
found
that
even
if
the
aqueducts
were
cut
the
city
would
have
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
cubic
meters
of
filtered
water
available
every
day
from
the
ivry
and
waterworks
and
even
without
these
paris
could
still
have
two
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
cubic
meters
a
day
chemically
purified
the
municipal
council
has
also
approved
a
proposal
to
buy
up
certain
provisions
to
be
added
to
the
necessaries
of
life
for
the
civilian
population
georges
clemençeau
the
parliamentary
tiger
who
although
remaining
outside
the
cabinet
is
one
of
the
greatest
personal
forces
of
france
has
made
a
stirring
statement
to
somerville
story
editor
of
the
clemençeau
said
yes
their
guns
are
almost
within
sound
of
paris
and
what
if
they
are
what
if
we
were
yet
to
be
defeated
again
and
again
we
should
still
go
on
let
them
burn
paris
if
they
can
let
them
wipe
it
out
raze
it
to
the
level
of
the
ground
we
shall
still
fight
on
this
is
not
my
personal
resolve
alone
the
government
too
is
just
as
grimly
determined
do
you
know
it
is
strange
that
one
should
have
been
able
to
come
to
feel
like
this
but
the
germans
could
destroy
all
these
beautiful
places
that
i
love
so
much
they
may
blow
up
the
museums
overthrow
monuments
it
would
only
leave
me
still
determined
to
fight
on
france
may
disappear
if
you
like
it
may
be
called
frankreich
if
you
like
we
may
be
driven
back
to
the
very
pyrenees
it
will
not
abate
one
fraction
our
vigor
and
our
decision
and
in
this
terrible
war
we
must
all
realize
how
unutterably
great
are
the
stakes
it
is
we
in
france
and
our
friends
in
belgium
who
are
doomed
to
suffer
the
most
bitterly
england
will
be
spared
much
that
we
must
endure
but
we
must
all
make
sacrifices
almost
beyond
reckoning
we
are
fighting
for
the
dignity
of
humanity
we
are
fighting
for
the
right
of
civilization
to
continue
to
exist
we
are
fighting
so
that
nations
may
continue
to
live
in
europe
without
being
under
the
heel
of
another
nation
it
is
a
great
cause
it
is
worthy
of
great
sacrifices
i
say
this
to
convince
you
of
the
unbreakable
spirit
of
the
french
nation
but
the
situation
is
not
yet
so
grave
we
knew
our
frontier
would
be
invaded
somewhere
we
have
many
troops
in
reserve
for
the
big
battle
that
will
follow
this
one
the
germans
can
not
besiege
or
invest
paris
its
size
is
too
vast
its
defence
will
be
assisted
by
the
armies
now
fighting
on
the
oise
seventy
miles
away
the
fortifications
of
paris
are
by
no
means
the
feeble
things
they
were
in
from
the
eiffel
tower
we
can
control
the
movements
in
with
our
armies
in
the
provinces
of
france
the
situation
is
in
no
way
desperate
although
the
germans
have
invaded
france
france
will
fight
on
and
on
until
this
attempt
to
establish
tyranny
in
europe
is
overthrown

the
famous

corps
will
be
the

of
the
battle
of

the
mailed
fist
is
doing
his
best
to
celebrate
it
by
leading
his

to
paris
it
is
daredevil
desperation
that
spurs
him
on
for
nowhere
as
yet
have
the

been
broken

and
they
continue
to
present
successive
stone

to
the
teuton
invasion
and
oppose
every
inch
of

dogged
tenacity
the

has
been
forced
always
by
the
traditional
enveloping
tactics
on
their
right
to
retreat
but
they
do
so
sullenly
and
in
good
order
making
the
germans
pay
dearly
for
every
step
gained
the

continuously
and
much
depends
upon
which

the

there
is

all

rushed
for

expresses
the
opinion
that
it

for

our

towards

the

however

realize
his
boast
that
he
would
celebrate

of

distance
of
the

may
indicate
that
the
turning
point
of
this
phase
of
the

is
near
at

the
allied

north
of

have
established
themselves
in
a

position
more
favorable
than
that
into

an

was

to
draw
them
the

still

the

no

was
done

were
found
in

when
i
heard
the

i
looked
up

out
of
regular
employment
make
a
circumference
of
two
hundred
kilometers
or
about
one
hundred
and
miles
this
line
of
defence
would
protect
paris
and
also
a
field
army
with
all
its
own
resources
and
probably
make
it
impossible
for
the
germans
to
completely
invest
the
city
as
they
did
in
meanwhile
the
allied
armies
outside
of
paris
would
be
able
to
keep
the
rest
of
the
german
armies
busy
and
threaten
the
long
line
of
german
communications
paris
would
thus
be
able
to
hold
out
for
a
long
time
the
germans
would
obtain
food
supplies
from
the
rich
country
that
they
occupy
but
their
supplies
of
ammunition
and
of
men
to
fill
gaps
in

of

must
become

the

fleeing

of

forty

wounded
in
the
recent
fighting
in
the

department
arrived
at
nine
this

at
the

most
of

were
shot
in
the
legs
and
arms
but
in

their
sufferings
none
of
them
showed
the
least
sign
of
being
broken
in
spirit
as
they
were
transported
from
the
train
there
were
touching
demonstrations
of
sympathy
from
the
crowd
which
the
wounded
men
acknowledged
to
the
best
of
their
ability
by
a
pretty
little
attention
on
the

of
the

in

all
the
men
wore
a

and
had
been
the
recipients
of
refreshments
and
fair
words
of
encouragement
there
was
quite
a
procession
of
wounded
of
various
nationalities
at
the
station
and
scenes
were
witnessed
which
caused
the
tears
to
start
in
many
eyes
a
group
of
belgian
soldiers
including
several
wounded
encountered
the
british
convoy
on
their
arrival
and
hearty
handshakes
were
exchanged
half
an
hour
after
the
arrival
of
the
british
wounded
a
party
of
thirty
turcos
wounded
in
the
battle
of
guise
came
in
and
were
in
turn
accorded
an
ovation
according
to
one
of
the
men
they
fought
for
nine
days
and
nights
without
a
break
but
were
gratified
in
the
end
by
beating
back
the
enemy
with
one
voice
they
declared
that
they
are
impatient
to
get
back
again

this

frenchmen
for
several
weeks
during

our
heroic
troops
have
struggled
with
the
enemy
army
our
soldiers
valiance
has
brought
them
marked
advantages
on
several
points
but
to
the
north
the
advance
of
the
german
forces
has
compelled
us
to
draw
back
this
situation
imposes
on
the
president
of
the
republic
and
the
government
a
painful
decision
to
safeguard
the
national
salvation
the
public
powers
have
as
a
duty
momentarily
to
leave
the
city
of
paris
under
the
command
of
an
eminent
leader
a
french
army
full
of
courage
and
zest
will
defend
the
capital
and
its
patriotic
population
against
the
invader
but
the
war
must
be
pursued
at
the
same
time
over
the
rest
of
the
land
without
peace
or
truce
without
halt
or
faltering
the
sacred
struggle
for
the
honor
of
the
nation
and
the
reparation
of
violated
right
will
be
continued
none
of
our
armies
is
cut
into
if
some
of
them
have
undergone
losses
too
great
losses
the
vacant
places
have
been
immediately
filled
by
the
dépôts
and
the
call
of
the
recruits
ensures
for
us
for
further
resources
of
men
and
energies
fight
and
stand
firm
such
must
be
the
watchword
of
the
allied
armies
british
russian
belgian
and
french
fight
and
stand
firm
while
on
the
sea
the
british
help
us
to
cut
our
enemy
line
of
communications
with
the
outside
world
fight
and
stand
firm
while
the
russians
continue
to
advance
to
strike
the
decisive
blow
in
the
heart
of
the
german
empire
it
is
the
duty
of
the
government
of
the
republic
to
direct
this
stubborn
resistance
frenchmen
will
rise
on
every
side
for
the
sake
of
independence
but
in
order
that
this
formidable
struggle
shall
be
conducted
as
efficaciously
and
with
as
much
spirit
as
possible
it
is
essential
that
the
government
should
be
left
free
to
act
at
the
request
of
the
military
authorities
therefore
the
government
will
be
temporarily
transferred
to
a
point
in
french
territory
where
it
can
remain
in
constant
relations
with
the
whole
of
the
country
the
government
requests
members
of
parliament
not
to
remain
too
distant
from
it
in
order
that
in
conjunction
with
them
and
with
their
colleagues
they
may
be
able
to
form
a
solid
core
of
national
unity
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
the
government
leaves
paris
only
after
having
assured
by
every
means
within
its
power
the
defence
of
the
city
and
the
entrenched
camp
it
knows
that
there
is
no
necessity
to
recommend
the
admirable
population
of
paris
to
remain
calm
resolute
and
every
day
the
people
show
that
it
is
equal
to
this
highest
duty
frenchmen
let
us
be
worthy
of
these
tragic
circumstances
we
shall
win
the
victory
finally
we
shall
win
it
by
untiring
will
endurance
and
tenacity
a
nation
which
is
determined
not
to
perish
and
which
recoils
neither
before
suffering
nor
sacrifice
is
sure
to
conquer
this
proclamation
had
a
good
effect
on
the
population
the
wife
of
my
concierge
voiced
the
popular
sentiment
when
she
said
this
evening
ah
monsieur
we
may
have
some
pretty
bad
here
but
we
have
such
confidence
that
all
must
end
well
that
my
husband
old
mother
and
our
little
children
will
remain
in
paris
with
us
this
remark
was
made
five
minutes
after
a
german
had
flown
over
the
roof
of
the
houses
in
my
street
rue
and
had
dropped
near
the
parc

to
return

at
the

this
was
promptly
done
the
performance
being
postponed
the
postponement
was
due
to
the
appearance
of
several
french
aeroplanes
which
evidently
had
been
sighted
by
the
germans
now
that
the

my
servant
félicien
telephoned
me
from
aubervillier
some
ten
kilometers
from
paris
saying
that
he
together
with
four
men
of
his
squadron
had
become
separated
from
his
regiment
the
dragoons
they
had
lost
their
horses
in
the
marshes
and
woods
near
chantilly
during
a
cavalry
engagement
and
had
been
instructed
to
make
their
way
to
paris
and
rejoin
their
regimental
dépôt
at
versailles
the
party
was
in
charge
of
their
sergeant
who
explained
that
the
regiment
had
at
first
been
sent
towards
metz
where
they
took
part
in
the
daily
fighting
all
along
the
line
there
and
that
suddenly
they
were
entrained
and
rushed
across
country
to
péronne
to
check
the
advance
of
the
germans
in
their
march
upon
paris
this
seems
to
indicate
that
the
french
generals
did
not
fully
appreciate
until
too
late
the
really
vital
importance
of
the
concentrated
rush
upon
paris
of
the
right
wing
of
the
german
armies
where
all
their
strength
had
been
assembled
the
dragoons
seemed
pretty
worn
out
but
were
in
good
spirits
and
anxious
to
get
back
again
in
the

they
must
go

had
to
have
their

with
them
i
registered
for
my
little
place
at
vernon
and
also
for
my
apartment
in
the
rue
among
well
known
americans
whom
i
saw
at

were
james

julius

robert
stewart
william
morton
fullerton
duer
formerly
clarence
mackay
joseph
blake
and
about
a
hundred
others
all
sorts
of
wild
rumors
about
the
approaching
germans
were
current
one
tremulous
little
lady
said
that
when
the
germans
entered
the
forest
of
compiègne
the
french
set
fire
to
the
woods
and
then
shot
down
the
germans
like
rabbits
as
they
fled
from
the
burning
thicket
i
met
here
robert
dunn
war
correspondent
of
the
york
evening
who
is
the
only
newspaper
man
i
have
talked
with
who
really
saw
the
fighting
near
la
câteau
and
saint
quentin
dunn
went
on
a
train
with
his
bicycle
last
week
provided
only
with
a
for
aulnay
in
the
department
of
the
north
the
train
was
brought
to
a
stop
near
aulnay
and
the
passengers
were
informed
that
german
cavalry
occupied
the
line
a
couple
of
kilometers
further
on
every
one
got
out
dunn
jumped
on
his
bicycle
and
wheeled
off
to
la
câteau
here
he
met
the
british
retreating
in
good
order
he
remained
with
them
as
they
retired
toward
saint
quentin
he
saw
them
spread
out
in
thin
lines
and
pick
off
the
german
gunners
by
their
splendid
marksmanship
most
of
the
british
were
wounded
by
shells
very
few
of
them
had
bullet
wounds
at
saint
quentin
a
few
highlanders
came
limping
along
thoroughly
exhausted
with
their
five
days
continuous
fighting
but
although
pale
and
hungry
their
jaws
were
set
with
determined
grit
their
superb
pluck
impressed
dunn
immensely
as
they
were
sitting
at
a
café
some
french
soldiers
led
away
a
german
spy
with
a
towel
wrapped
around
his
eyes
the
man
was
executed
i
met
a
british
staff
officer
at
brentano
bookstore
as
he
was
buying
maps
of
the
environs
of
paris
i
told
him
that
lord
kitchener
had
been
to
paris
and
had
conferred
with
millerand
the
french
minister
of
war
the
officer
said
i
am
glad
to
hear
of
because
at
a
certain
phase
of
the
fighting
in
the
north
the
completely
failed
to
support
i
called
upon
william
sharp
the
newly
appointed
united
states
ambassador
and
upon
robert
bacon
the
former
united
states
ambassador
both
are
stopping
at
the
hôtel
de
crillon
the
paris
newspapers
seem
highly
pleased
at
this
strong
diplomatic
manifestation
the
american
ambassador
of
yesterday
the
american
ambassador
of
today
and
the
american
ambassador
of
tomorrow
constituting
a
delegation
from
the
united
states
to
see
that
the
rights
of
universal
humanity
are
respected
parisians
salute
the
star
spangled
banner
as
it
floats
over
the
american
embassy
as
the
symbol
of
the
world
vigilance
against
barbarity
such
are
the
words
of
gabriel
hanotaux
writing
in
the
attaches
equal
importance
to
the
attitude
of
the
united
states
as
interpreted
by
its
three
representatives
saying
herrick
is
very
happily
not
leaving
us
he
has
followed
the
whole
course
of
events
which
led
to
this
fatal
war
watching
with
a
just
and
noble
spirit
he
has
kept
his
government
accurately
informed
of
all
and
he
will
continue
at
the
head
of
the
embassy
the
says
that
of
all
the
diplomatists
accredited
to
france
it
was
herrick
who
took
the
gallant
initiative
to
remain
in
paris
and
parisians
deeply
appreciate
this
in
making
this
choice
herrick
said
that
he
regarded
paris
not
only
as
the
capital
of
france
but
as
that
of
the
world
spoken
of
by
marcus
aurelius
he
feels
that
he
is
the
american
ambassador
to
both
these
cities
in
his
eyes
this
of
the
world
possesses
a
government
invisible
doubtless
but
perpetually
present
and
one
with
which
he
wishes
to
remain
in
touch
it
is
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
paris
in
its
period
of
trial
and
to
the
fatherland
of
the
human
race
that
herrick
wishes
to
give
the
pledge
of
his
affection
thus
he
is
remaining
as
a
link
between
those
of
his
compatriots
who
are
residing
among
us
and
the
citizens
of
the
free
republic
across
the
sea
that
has
more
than
once
declared
itself
the
sister
republic
and
which
professes
as
much
love
for
our
as
we
ourselves
esteem
the
passion
for
of
which
it
gives
the
example

germans
appear
to
have
evacuated
the

and
are
apparently
moving
towards
the
southeast
thus
continuing
a
movement
that
began
on
friday
general
cherfils
the
military
critic
of
the
taking
a
very
optimistic
view
of
the
situation
thinks
the
movement
may
be
to
assure
a
retreat
by
some
route
other
than
by
a
return
through
belgium
general
cherfils
says
this
rush
of
the
german
right
wing
upon
paris
is
the
last
bluff
of
terrorism
of
the
last
german
emperor
the
kaiser
thought
that
he
could
frighten
us
and
induce
france
to
make
peace
after
which
he
would
be
free
to
return
with
his
armies
against
russia
morel
the
financial
correspondent
of
the
daily
came
to
see
me
he
lives
at
reuil
in
the
military
zone
northwest
of
fort
he
had
been
up
all
night
getting
his
belongings
to
paris
and
had
just
sent
his
little
daughter
to
dieppe
on
her
way
to
england
morel
said
that
the
night
trains
out
of
paris
at
the
gare
were
filled
to
overflowing
no
lights
were
permitted
in
the
cars
and
a
dozen
soldiers
with
loaded
rifles
were
placed
in
a
car
just
behind
the
locomotive
and
a
dozen
more
soldiers
at
the
rear
end
of
the
train
these
trains
stop
at
every
station
and
take
about
ten
hours
to
reach
dieppe
instead
of
four
hours
as
usual
precautions
of
guarding
the
trains
are
made
because
several
german
armored
had
been
signalled
dashing
about
near
marly
and
pontoise
the
gardener
of
my
little
place
at
vernon
which
is
on
the
western
line
of
the
seine
at
a
point
where
it
is
intersected
by
a
strategic
line
between
chartres
in
the
south
and
gisors
and
beauvais
in
the
north
seems
to
be
confident
that
vernon
will
not
be
occupied
by
the
germans
for
he
managed
to
send
me
today
a
big
basket
full
of
peaches
pears
string
beans
and
green
corn
the
first
oysters
make
their
appearance
this
event
trivial
in
itself
is
significant
as
showing
that
the
paris
central
markets
are
able
to
supply
parisians
not
only
with
necessities
but
with
luxuries
the
mute
oyster
that
comes
in
with
the
months
having
the
letter
r
in
their
names
bears
eloquent
testimony
to
uninterrupted
communications
i
looked
in
for
a
few
moments
this
afternoon
at
the
national
library
in
the
rue
de
richelieu
no
signs
of
war
here
a
score
of
inveterate
bookworms
were
pondering
over
dusty
volumes
inquisitive
writers
were
exploring
literature
bearing
upon
the
war
of
seeking
precedents
and
parallels
for
coming
events
a
few
ladies
were
looking
up
files
of
old
newspapers
and
fashion
plates
the
national
library
seemed
exactly
as
in
the
most
peaceful
days
i
lunched
at
the
restaurant
beaugé
in
the
rue
a
favorite
resort
of
journalists
the
manager
told
me
that
it
would
be
closed
that
evening
it
seems
that
he
had
received
a
third
warning
not
to
keep
open
after
nine
as
he
could
never
pluck
up
courage
to
eject
his
customers
while
enjoying
succulent
repasts
he
decided
to
shut
up
his
place
altogether
the
suggestion
made
by
an
irishman
sullivan
of
reuter
agency
to
employ
a
london
did
not
at
all
appeal
to
his
notions
of
the
traditions
of
parisian
gastronomic
hospitality
i
met
another
british
officer
buying
books
at
brentano
he
gave
me
a
picturesque
description
of
the
german
method
of
advance
it
is
the
scientific
development
of
the
wild
fanatic
condensed
rush
of
the
soudan
dervishes
he
said
the
germans
mass
together
all
their
big
field
guns
they
close
in
around
them
serried
infantry
goaded
on
by
their
wonderful
officers
who
prick
them
with
sword
bayonets
and
whenever
from
wounds
or
from
sheer
exhaustion
men
fall
out
they
are
shoved
aside
to
die
by
the
roadside
or
to
be
trampled
under
foot
like
mechanical
tools
that
have
become
useless
the
german
officers
and
officers
are
utterly
regardless
of
life
the
german
flanks
are
protected
by
quantities
of
machine
guns
placed
so
close
together
that
their
gunners
jostle
one
another
this
strange
engine
of
modern
warfare

on

a
monster
of
the

all

hovering
over
the
fronts
of

the
dense
serried
mass
of

a
splendid
target
the
losses
must
have
been
frightful
exceeding
anything
recorded
in

the
german
infantry
are
poor
marksmen
they
do
know
how
to
shoot
scarcely
any
of

were
wounded
by

nearly
all
the
wounds
were
inflicted

the
trend

being
that
paris
was
the
most

place
to
be
in
just
now
and
that
perhaps
the
best
story
of

in

i
drove
in

with

to

of

that
was

sitting
at

opposite

i
noticed
the
huge
statues
of

vienna
over
the
front
of
the
building
and
wondered
if
they
would
remain
intact
during

driving
to
the

saw
gangs
of
workmen
with
entrenching

going
into

the

questioned
it
turned
out
that

the
has
decided
to
remain
in
paris
but
its
price
will
be

instead
of

the
reasons
for
the

are
that

government
of
paris
for
an
eventual
siege
the
bois
de
boulogne
resembles
a
cattle
ranch
the
census
of
the
civil
population
of
the
entrenched
camp
of
paris
just
taken
with
a
view
of
providing
rations
during
a
possible
siege
shows
that
there
are
families
residing
in
paris
representing
a
total
of
individuals
of
all
ages
and
both
sexes
this
is
a
decrease
of
thirty
percent
since
the
last
census
in
the
health
of
the
city
is
excellent
the
census
sheets
notify
inhabitants
that
gas
during
a
siege
must
be
used
exclusively
for
lighting
purposes
and
never
for
cooking
or
heating
this
will
cause
some
tribulation
in
the
small
ménages
where
the
cheap
popular
and
handy
has
replaced
the
coal
or
charcoal
ovens
and
ranges
the
ram
came
on
this
afternoon
at
four
while
a
large
crowd
of
parisians
stood
in
the
square
in
front
of
the
church
of
du
mont
beside
the
pantheon
but
it
failed
to
disperse
the
faithful
who
were
taking
part
in
the
outdoor
service
of
homage
to
the
protectress
of
paris
whose
remains
are
buried
in
this
small
church
of
the
period
one
of
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
sacred
edifices
of
france
those
who
recently
hastened
away
from
paris
in
search
of
a
place
of
refuge
quiet
and
safety
have
met
with
many
disappointments
the
roads
to
tours
are
blocked
with
vehicles
of
every
description
many
of
them
filled
with
refugees
who
have
turned
them
into
temporary
dwellings
automobiles
are
brought
to
a
standstill
for
lack
of
benzol
everything
on
the
way
from
paris
to
bordeaux
is
requisitioned
at
orléans
people
wander
about
vainly
seeking
a
place
in
which
to
sleep
the
town
is
filled
people
buy
ham
and
sausages
which
they
eat
in
cafés
or
in
the
streets
at
blois
the
citizens
offer
to
lodge
refugees
and
travelers
at
the
rate
of
five
francs
a
day
the
blois
people
are
very
hospitable
and
do
not
seek
to
unduly
profit
by
the
situation
the
grand
hotel
is
of
course
overflowing
but
the
prices
remain
the
same
as
in
ordinary
times
at
tours
the
inhabitants
are
less
hospitable
and
more
avaricious
one
of
the
biggest
hotels
in
the
town
asks
fifty
francs
ten
dollars
for
a
simple
armchair
in
which
to
pass
the
night
three
special
trains
yesterday
carried
away
to
provence
the
inmates
of
the
insane
asylums
of
bicêtre
and
charenton
it
was
a
weird
sight
to
see
these
men
and
women
utterly
unconscious
of
the
war
gazing
with
nervous
uncertainty
upon
the
strange
scenes
through
which
they
were
conducted
to
the
orléans
station
somewhat
like
helpless
flocks
of
sheep
shortly
after
leaving
the
large
room
at
number
boulevard
des
invalides
where
the
official
are
now
given
out
to
the
french
and
foreign
press
i
met
a
sergeant
of
an
infantry
regiment
who
had
been
wounded
during
the
fighting
between
coulommier
and
at
daybreak
on
sunday
he
said
we
were
sent
forward
to
prevent
the
german
infantry
from
making
their
favorite
turning
movement
on
our
left
wing
our
orders
were
to
hold
on
to
the
enemy
and
prevent
his
advance
until
the
allied
troops
near
meaux
had
repulsed
the
german
attack
being
made
in
their
direction
early
in
the
afternoon
the
germans
retired
from
meaux
before
the
allied
divisions
we
advanced
and
drove
them
north
of
the
fighting
lasted
all
night
and
became
very
severe
on
monday
morning
but
shortly
afterwards
the
germans
offered
but
slight
resistance
for
thirty
kilometers
we
followed
up
two
german
infantry
regiments
supported
by
their
cavalry
and
a
section
of
artillery
during
their
retreat
the
germans
did
not
fire
a
single
shot
we
soon
succeeded
in
cutting
off
a
detachment
of
infantry
and
in
capturing
seven
field
guns
and
two
machine
guns
one
of
the
prisoners
an
infantry
sergeant
admitted
that
his
men
were
short
of
ammunition
and
that
their
orders
were
to
use
as
little
of
it
as
possible
it
was
during
the
last
combat
that
i
was
wounded
in
the
thigh
by
a
prussian
officer
who
cut
me
with
his
sword
as
i
was
trying
to
disarm
him
a
wounded
french
infantry
lieutenant
says
that
the
german
troops
seem
fatigued
and
fagged
out
another
officer
says
that
in
the
trenches
near
coulommier
a
dozen
german
infantry
soldiers
were
found
dead
having
been
killed
by
french
millimeter
shells
and
were
in
the
same
attitudes
of
firing
that
they
had
taken
at
the
moment
when
they
had
been
crisped
by
death
an
algerian
turco
was
found
dead
grasping
his
rifle
the
bayonet
of
which
had
pierced
and
killed
a
german
soldier
both
were
corpses
but
stood
in
grim
death
like
a
group
of
statuary
i
received
a
letter
from
my
gardener
at
vernon
he
says
that
the
roads
are
filled
with
refugees
who
are
being
sent
on
to
brittany
by
way
of
louviers
motorists
along
the
roads
say
that
they
have
passed
continuous
lines
of
refugees
sometimes
seventy
kilometers
in
length
the
château
de
bizy
is
transformed
into
a
hospital
and
so
also
is
the
château
des
pénitents
at
vernonnet
most
of
the
injured
have
slight
wounds
in
the
arms
or
legs
many
of
them
after
five
days
treatment
are
able
to
go
back
to
the
front
september
day
of
the
war
somewhat
cooler
weather
with
cloudy
sky
and
with
south
to
southwesterly
wind
at
times
blowing
in
sharp
gusts
thermometer
at
five
degrees
centigrade
the
air
is
still
overcharged
with
uncertainty
as
to
the
result
of
the
great
battle
along
the
front
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
between
the
ourcq
and
verdun
will
the
germans
succeed
in
forcing
their
tremendous
wedge
through
the
french
center
near
vitry
and
separate
the
allied
armies
to
the
west
and
around
paris
from
the
great
french
armies
to
the
east
and
around
verdun
a
german
repulse
means
a
german
tragedy
but
if
they
succeed
in
their
bold
move
on
the
center
and
separate
the
allied
armies
they
will
gain
a
very
great
strategic
success
and
can
then
turn
their
attention
to
the
investment
of
a
segment
of
the
fortifications
of
paris
meanwhile
the
official
given
out
at
three
and
at
eleven
at
the
military
government
of
paris
are
to
say
the
least
hopeful
every
attempt
to
break
through
the
french
lines
on
the
ourcq
has
failed
no
change
noted
on
the
center
and
on
the
allied
right
at
two
this
afternoon
i
saw
a
small
low
dusty
come
spinning
along
the
boulevard
des
invalides
containing
four
soldiers
who
had
with
them
two
german
flags
captured
this
morning
during
the
fighting
near
the
ourcq
they
were
bringing
their
trophies
to
general
galliéni
who
conferred
the
military
medal
the
highest
french
distinction
for
valor
in
action
on
the
reserve
infantry
soldier
guillemard
who
captured
one
of
these
flags
in
a
encounter
the
flag
belonged
to
the
prussian
infantry
regiment
the
magdeburg
fusiliers
and
had
been
decorated
with
the
iron
cross
in
one
of
the
french
biplanes
that
scour
the
sky
daily
in
search
of
german
met
with
sad
disaster
yesterday
while
flying
over
the
bois
de
vincennes
the
aeroplane
contained
a
lieutenant
and
a
corporal
of
the
aviation
corps
a
violent
gust
of
wind
capsized
it
and
it
fell
to
the
ground
burying
the
occupants
in
a
heap
of
débris
when
extricated
both
were
dead
a
few
moments
after
the
biplane
struck
the
earth
either
its
motor
or
the
bombs
that
it
had
on
board
exploded
and
four
were
killed
by
flying
fragments
two
of
them
were
lads
a
little
girl
and
several
other
persons
were
more
or
less
bruised
it
so
happened
that
i
had
watched
this
biplane
from
the
boulevard
de
courcelles
as
it
soared
over
paris
at
a
height
of
fifteen
hundred
meters
it
was
very
steady
in
its
movements
and
was
going
in
an
easterly
direction
this
must
have
been
some
ten
minutes
before
the
catastrophe
the
committee
of
the
national
society
of
fine
arts
held
a
meeting
today
at
the
grand
palais
to
render
aid
to
painters
sculptors
and
artists
in
need
of
assistance
without
regard
to
nationality
passed
resolutions
of
indignation
at
the
injury
of
works
of
art
in
france
and
belgium
committed
by
the
german
armies
and
at
the
destruction
of
the
objects
of
art
solicited
by
germany
and
entrusted
by
france
to
the
international
exhibition
at
leipsic
and
unanimously
voted
to
strike
from
the
list
of
members
the
names
of
all
artists
of
german
nationality
the
art
critic
of
the
louis
vauxelles
whose
scathing
criticisms
of
the
classic
academic
school
of
painting
and
of
sculpture
and
whose
intelligent
censure
of
the
extreme
futurist
clique
elicit
the
hearty
approval
of
all
true
lovers
of
art
in
the
united
states
as
well
as
in
france
is
serving
as
a
simple
soldier
in
an
infantry
regiment
but
finds
time
occasionally
to
write
to
the
picturesque
descriptions
of
military
life
i
received
a
letter
from
a
friend
at
tours
where
the
refugees
are
becoming
less
numerous
but
the
hospitals
on
the
contrary
are
nearly
full
of
wounded
comtesse
paul
de
pourtalès
is
doing
splendid
work
there
as
the
head
of
the
red
cross
and
gaston
ménier
the
popular
senator
a
warm
personal
friend
of
andrew
carnegie
and
the
owner
of
the
great
chocolate
works
has
turned
his
château
of
chenonceaux
into
a
perfectly
organized
hospital
with
a
corps
of
surgeons
and
professional
nurses
which
he
maintains
at
his
own
expense
nearly
a
hundred
french
wounded
are
already
being
cared
for
in
the
chenonceaux
hospital
as
soon
as
they
get
well
enough
they
are
sent
back
to
rejoin
their
regiments
all
the
villas
in
the
neighborhood
of
tours
are
already
leased
to
families
that
have
gone
away
from
paris
in
accordance
with
the
notices
of
the
military
governor
of
paris
i
was
vaccinated
against
smallpox
together
with
all
those
now
living
in
the
house
in
all
twelve
persons
william
sharp
who
has
been
appointed
to
succeed
myron
herrick
as
american
ambassador
in
france
remains
here
with
his
son
george
and
is
preparing
to
make
himself
familiar
with
the
situation
so
that
when
the
proper
time
comes
he
may
take
over
his
office
sharp
is
already
making
headway
with
his
somewhat
theoretical
knowledge
of
french
he
told
me
that
the
war
had
upset
many
diplomatic
and
other
precedents
it
is
quite
obvious
he
said
that
at
this
critical
period
herrick
could
not
desert
his
post
where
his
knowledge
and
experience
have
been
so
valuable
sharp
added
it
is
needless
to
say
that
there
will
be
no
change
of
policy
with
my
arrival
as
ambassador
to
france
the
friendship
between
the
united
states
and
france
was
never
firmer
than
it
is
personally
i
am
a
fervent
admirer
of
france
of
french
art
culture
and
science
probably
no
country
in
the
world
is
more
universally
admired
for
its
high
degree
of
civilization
than
france
but
it
is
my
duty
as
the
future
representative
of
the
united
states
to
be
absolutely
neutral
in
everything
concerning
the
present
conflict
it
can
not
be
too
strongly
stated
that
the
united
states
government
will
not
swerve
from
its
attitude
of
strict
neutrality
the
more
impartial
we
remain
the
stronger
our
position
will
be
and
the
better
it
will
be
indeed
for
all
the
belligerents
when
the
time
comes
for
discussing
the
conclusion
of
peace
for
i
shall
not
be
indiscreet
if
i
give
voice
to
the
thought
held
by
many
people
that
the
role
of
the
united
states
is
bound
to
be
a
most
important
one
at
that
moment
president
wilson
recent
offer
he
said
was
timely
and
although
every
one
knew
that
it
could
not
then
be
accepted
yet
it
had
the
effect
of
setting
men
minds
thinking
what
nation
could
be
more
fitted
than
the
united
states
to
take
the
lead
in
the
peace
negotiations
asked
sharp
in
our
nation
are
amalgamated
all
the
races
now
at
war
our
sincerity
is
undoubted
our
natural
position
of
impartiality
and
neutrality
is
such
that
voice
would
be
surely
listened
to
at
the
opportune
moment
sharp
himself
belongs
to
several
peace
organizations
in
america
he
believes
that
after
the
present
war
there
will
be
a
complete
revulsion
of
public
opinion
throughout
the
world
in
favor
of
peace
never
he
said
will
there
have
been
a
riper
moment
for
some
scheme
of
general
disarmament
sharp
would
like
to
see
the
united
states
a
party
to
an
treaty
sealing
such
an
international
accord
in
this
respect
he
believes
that
atrocious
as
this
european
conflagration
is
good
will
be
the
outcome
for
all
nations
whoever
the
victors
may
be
if
europe
reaps
a
lasting
peace
sharp
comes
to
paris
with
a
general
knowledge
of
international
political
affairs
having
served
as
a
member
in
the
united
states
congress
for
three
terms
and
holding
position
of
ranking
member
of
the
foreign
affairs
committee
at
the
time
of
his
appointment
september
day
of
the
war
cloudy
weather
with
a
brisk
shower
and
some
thunder
at
three
this
afternoon
afterwards
fine
southerly
wind
temperature
at
five
degrees
centigrade
favorable
news
was
communicated
at
eleven
this
evening
at
the
headquarters
at
the
invalides
after
four
days
of
steady
fighting
the
allied
left
wing
has
crossed
the
marne
near
charly
and
driven
back
the
enemy
sixty
kilometers
the
british
taking
many
prisoners
and
machine
guns
near
sezanne
the
prussian
guard
corps
has
been
driven
back
north
of
the
marshes
of
gond
no
change
is
noted
in
relative
positions
on
the
allied
center
and
right
where
fighting
still
continues
with
great
violence
i
went
to
the
official
press
bureau
at
three
this
afternoon
and
met
there
arthur
meyer
the
genial
and
venerable
editor
of
the
and
about
forty
french
and
foreign
journalists
arthur
meyer
as
dean
of
our
calling
had
a
pleasant
word
and
smile
for
all
just
before
the
official
the
director
of
the
press
bureau
commandant
klotz
former
minister
of
finance
instructed
his
assistant
to
notify
all
present
that
any
reproduction
of
or
even
allusion
to
the
interview
published
in
an
american
morning
paper
the
with
an
american
diplomatist
would
not
pass
the
censor
if
handed
in
at
the
telegraph
or
cable
offices
and
also
that
its
appearance
in
any
french
newspaper
was
prohibited
the
reason
for
this
is
that
the
interview
might
cause
misunderstanding
and
that
it
merely
reflected
the
personal
opinions
of
a
private
individual
who
in
no
way
was
an
accredited
representative
of
the
united
states
this
official
rebuke
was
of
course
intended
for
william
sharp
whose
interview
was
printed
in
today
according
to
european
custom
diplomacy
is
a
special
calling
or
profession
like
those
of
the
soldier
sailor
lawyer
or
physician
amateur
diplomacy
has
no
place
in
europe
and
to
the
french
mind
the
presence
in
paris
of
an
unaccredited
although
designated
ambassador
who
expresses
his
personal
opinions
on
every
subject
while
there
is
a
duly
accredited
ambassador
here
is
an
anomaly
causing
no
little
annoyance
to
the
authorities
and
tending
to
hamper
and
discredit
the
official
representative
of
the
united
states
in
paris
it
is
whispered
that
this
diplomatic
indiscretion
of
sharp
may
lead
to
a
refusal
of
the
french
government
when
the
time
comes
to
grant
his
credentials
all
the
more
so
because
when
sharp
was
first
spoken
of
as
a
possible
ambassador
to
russia
the
russian
foreign
office
notified
washington
that
sharp
was
not
exactly
a
owing
to
certain
public
statements
attributed
to
him
concerning
the
attitude
of
the
russian
government
in
regard
to
passports
to
jews
of
american
and
other
nationalities
when
sharp
was
nominated
as
american
ambassador
to
france
the
french
foreign
office
discreetly
inquired
at
petersburg
whether
the
russian
government
had
any
objection
to
sharp
being
accepted
in
paris
as
the
united
states
ambassador
the
reply
from
petersburg
was
that
there
were
no
objections
consequently
the
usual
intimation
was
given
by
the
quai
that
sharp
would
be
an
agreeable
person
in
paris
the
arrival
here
of
sharp
in
the
midst
of
the
war
and
his
interview
on
the
situation
however
has
not
influenced
the
french
officials
at
the
foreign
office
in
his
favor
sharp
is
unquestionably
a
patriotic
capable
and
highly
intelligent
representative
of
our
countrymen
and
moreover
he
is
now
obtaining
diplomatic
experience
spain
has
also
had
some
tribulation
with
its
ambassadors
to
france
when
president
poincaré
and
the
french
cabinet
decided
to
transfer
the
seat
of
government
to
bordeaux
the
spanish
ambassador
marquis
de
villa
urrutia
was
about
to
quit
paris
with
president
poincaré
but
the
king
of
spain
wished
his
representative
to
remain
in
paris
the
marquis
however
to
use
an
american
expression
got
cold
feet
and
expressed
a
wish
to
go
to
bordeaux
when
this
news
reached
king
alfonso
it
so
happened
that
de
los
monteros
marquis
de
valtierra
of
northern
spain
at
burgos
and
san
sebastian
was
in
conference
with
the
king
king
alfonso
asked
the
marquis
de
valtierra
where
in
his
opinion
would
be
the
proper
place
in
france
for
the
spanish
ambassador
why
was
the
quick
reply
paris
of
course
well
said
the
king
that
is
not
the
opinion
of
the
marquis
de
villa
urrutia
but
it
is
also
my
own
opinion
and
i
have
now
decided
to
send
you
to
paris
as
my
ambassador
consequently
the
marquis
de
villa
urrutia
was
forthwith
replaced
by
the
marquis
de
valtierra
who
is
already
duly
installed
in
the
spanish
embassy
in
the
boulevard
de
courcelles
the
new
spanish
ambassador
speaks
english
perfectly
as
well
as
french
and
he
is
a
personal
friend
of
ambassador
herrick
the
condition
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
of
some
of
the
french
fortresses
in
the
north
near
the
belgian
frontier
as
well
as
around
rheims
and
for
which
the
french
chamber
of
deputies
refused
in
to
vote
appropriations
is
being
paid
for
a
thousandfold
in
when
experiments
made
at
malmaison
with
the
torpedo
shells
then
about
to
be
adopted
by
the
german
artillery
showed
that
no
forts
could
resist
them
unless
provided
with
armor
plates
and
with
protection
for
men
and
ammunition
a
new
plan
of
defence
was
drawn
up
as
the
cost
of
the
new
armor
and
protection
for
the
forts
was
very
great
it
was
decided
to
a
number
of
fortresses
among
which
were
lille
douai
arras
landrecies
péronne
and
others
it
had
already
been
foreseen
that
the
main
german
attack
would
some
day
be
made
through
luxemburg
and
belgium
the
fortresses
of
maubeuge
charlemont
givet
montmédy
and
longwy
then
became
of
supreme
importance
for
the
defence
of
northern
france
against
an
invading
army
through
belgium
the
chamber
of
deputies
persistently
refused
to
vote
the
necessary
money
and
the
result
of
this
want
of
foresight
became
painfully
apparent
during
the
present
war
when
the
germans
made
their
broad
sweep
from
belgium
to
compiègne
meeting
on
their
way
with
no
permanent
works
of
defence
the
civil
and
religious
wedding
of
james
gordon
bennett
proprietor
of
the
york
with
baroness
george
de
reuter
took
place
at
the
town
hall
of
the
ninth
arrondissement
of
paris
and
at
the
american
episcopal
church
of
the
holy
trinity
in
the
avenue
de
the
witnesses
of
the
bride
were
the
duc
de
camastra
and
vicomte
de
breteuil
those
for
bennett
were
the
american
ambassador
herrick
and
professor
albert
robin
the
scientist
and
member
of
the
french
academy
of
medicine
the
bride
was
the
widow
of
baron
george
de
reuter
and
was
formerly
miss
potter
of
baltimore
the
ceremonies
were
very
simple
the
only
guests
being
herrick
and
the
vicomtesse
de
breteuil
the
ceremony
in
the
church
was
performed
by
the
reverend
doctor
watson
those
present
afterwards
took
tea
at
the
residence
of
bennett
in
the
rue
de
lubeck
the
day
before
the
wedding
bennett
had
been
confirmed
by
the
reverend
doctor
watson
in
the
faith
of
the
american
episcopal
church
it
will
be
remembered
that
bennett
father
was
a
scotch
roman
catholic
while
his
mother
was
an
irish
protestant
a
combination
that
seldom
occurs
and
which
often
induced
bennett
to
playfully
remark
i
take
after
both
my
father
and
my
mother
for
when
i
find
myself
surrounded
by
genial
conviviality
i
feel
that
i
am
an
irishman
but
when
amidst
grave
cares
and
weighty
business
i
am
a
scotchman

the
german

seventy

in

days
all
seems
to
go
well
with
the
allies
the
heavy
rain
is
bad
for
the
german
retreat
especially
in
the
swampy
ground
they
must
pass
through
all
this
cheerful
news
from
the
front
gives
renewed
confidence
to
the
two
millions
of
parisians
remaining
at
home
who
begin
to
feel
that
there
is
no
longer
any
imminent
danger
of
being
besieged
what
might
be
called
a
of
the
war
appeared
in
the
shape
of
a
new
english
daily
newspaper
published
in
paris
called
the

it
consists
of
a
small
single
sheet
the

the
de
are
the
only
papers
now
printed
on
double
sheets
and
in
an
editorial
note
declares
that
its
policy
is
to
preach
courage
and
confidence
it
is
an
unpretentious
lively
amusing
little
production
and
may
eventually
have
a
brilliant
career
many
of
the
wounded
now
coming
in

treated
for

a
man
of
the
east
lancashire
regiment
who
had
his
left
arm
smashed
by
a
shell
said
that
when
his
detachment
were
attacked
at
dawn
in
a
village
near
compiègne
the
terrified
women
and
children
rushed
into
the
streets
in
their
night
gowns
their
houses
were
being
smashed
like
it
made
us
feel
badly
to
see
some
of
these
poor
women
and
children
blown
to
pieces
by
the
german
shells
we
tried
to
put
them
in
whatever
shelter
was
available
professor
pierre
delbet
of
the
paris
faculty
of
medicine
relates
an
extraordinary
conversation
between
a
young
general
commanding
a
division
of
the
prussian
guard
corps
and
doctor
delbet
mother
who
is
a
venerable
lady
of
professor
delbet
went
yesterday
to
visit
his
mother
at
her
country
house
situated
in
a
village
on
the
grand
morin
river
in
the
heart
of
the
region
where
the
fighting
took
place
a
few
days
ago
madame
delbet
house
is
in
the
center
of
the
village
and
on
her
grounds
a
small
wooden
bridge
connects
the
courtyard
and
flower
garden
with
the
vegetable
garden
on
the
other
bank
there
are
two
public
bridges
at
the
ends
of
the
village
but
these
had
been
blown
up
by
the
french
engineer
soldiers
last
friday
morning
the
germans
arrived
and
smashed
open
the
double
gate
of
madame
delbet
house
a
young
general
with
an
eyeglass
fixed
to
his
left
eye
approached
while
a
soldier
stood
with
a
loaded
revolver
pointed
at
the
old
lady
head
the
general
remarked
with
politeness
madame
you
will
let
us
pass
over
your
private
bridge
i
have
no
means
of
preventing
you
but
i
warn
you
the
bridge
is
not
very
solid
ah
we
will
see
to
that
the
general
gave
orders
and
in
fifteen
minutes
the
rickety
bridge
was
braced
up
with
three
strong
trusses
then
thirty
soldiers
were
put
on
the
bridge
and
jumped
six
times
in
unison
at
the
word
of
command
after
this
test
the
passage
of
troops
began
while
the
were
repairing
the
two
public
bridges
the
general
approached
madame
delbet
and
with
great
courtesy
placed
two
comfortable
armchairs
in
a
shady
nook
of
the
courtyard
and
by
an
invitation
that
seemed
to
be
a
command
requested
her
to
take
a
seat
and
see
the
little
prussian
review
that
would
surely
be
interesting
the
old
lady
sat
beside
the
general
and
witnessed
the
that
lasted
seven
hours
from
in
the
morning
to
in
the
evening
the
general
scrutinized
his
men
through
his
monocle
by
and
by
he
had
his
servant
make
some
tea
and
toast
which
he
offered
to
his
hostess
while
sipping
tea
the
general
said
madame
when
you
become
a
german
as
will
surely
be
the
case
you
will
be
proud
to
recollect
that
you
witnessed
the
passage
of
my
troops
over
your
bridge
i
shall
have
a
bronze
tablet
made
and
placed
over
your
gate
to
commemorate
the
event
when
madame
delbet
protested
the
general
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
and
said
why
madame
that
is
already
settled
you
can
not
defend
yourselves
oh
yes
you
have
in
mind
your
friends
the
english
and
your
friends
the
russians
but
your
good
friends
the
english
can
only
fight
on
the
sea
they
are
of
no
value
on
land
as
for
the
russians
they
do
know
what
an
army
is
at
this
moment
the
cavalry
was
passing
over
the
bridge
three
abreast
and
a
lancer
accidentally
knocked
over
a
bison
head
that
was
hung
in
the
court
as
a
hunting
trophy
the
general
severely
reprimanded
the
trooper
for
his
carelessness
and
ordered
the
cavalry
to
cross
two
abreast
the
conversation
continued
madame
delbet
said
that
she
thought
the
russians
had
made
considerable
progress
since
the
japanese
war
ah
yes
perhaps
but
they
have
no
real
army
the
general
then
remarked
now
about
the
french
you
yourself
madame
must
be
aware
as
you
belong
to
a
medical
family
that
the
french
are
absolutely
degenerate
the
french
have
come
to
the
end
of
their
tether
i
will
let
you
into
one
of
our
secrets
this
will
be
our
of
which
i
have
already
read
the
text
voilà
we
have
decided
to
preserve
a
selection
of
the
best
and
healthiest
frenchmen
and
marry
them
to
north
german
girls
of
strong
shape
and
build
the
result
of
this
cross
may
be
useful
children
as
to
the
other
frenchmen
who
survive
the
war
we
have
arranged
to
export
them
all
to
north
and
south
america
but
general
replied
madame
delbet
we
have
had
at
least
success
during
the
war
none
whatever
madame
why
we
have
captured
some
flags
anyway
where
did
you
see
that
in
the
newspapers
the
french
english
and
american
newspapers
publish
nothing
but
lies
in
two
days
we
shall
be
in
paris
the
general
then
gave
a
fresh
turn
to
his
eyeglass
and
called
madame
delbet
attention
to
the
splendid
physique
smart
appearance
perfect
order
method
and
discipline
of
his
troops
madame
delbet
admitted
that
this
praise
was
fully
justified
for
the
troops
and
horses
were
quite
fresh
their
uniforms
and
equipments
were
all
spick
and
span
and
the
officers
even
wore
fresh
unspotted
gloves
on
sunday
the
general
took
his
departure
as
he
came
to
bid
madame
delbet
he
said
i
am
going
to
paris
madame
and
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
there
kindly
let
me
know
he
then
mounted
his
beautiful
bay
charger
and
rode
away
followed
by
his
staff
a
couple
of
officers
and
a
small
detachment
were
left
in
the
village
monday
morning
a
german
automobile
dashed
through
the
village
at
fourth
speed
a
sentry
discharged
his
rifle
as
a
signal
the
same
troops
came
trotting
back
again
over
the
three
bridges
one
of
them
who
had
been
particularly
attentive
to
madame
delbet
maid
passed
through
the
little
courtyard
the
maid
slyly
asked
is
that
the
road
to
paris
she
received
the
reply
from
her
admirer
plus
paris
plus
paris
soon
afterwards
some
french
dragoons
galloped
into
the
village
over
the
bridges
that
the
germans
had
had
no
time
to
destroy
then
came
two
battalions
of
british
infantry
at
a
double
over
madame
delbet
little
garden
bridge
and
they
deployed
and
opened
fire
on
the
retreating
germans
a
paris
and
plus
paris
are
words
that
madame
delbet
says
will
always
ring
in
her
ears
for
these
phrases
exactly
describe
the
picturesque
side
glimpse
of
the
war
that
passed
in
her
pretty
little
courtyard
lined
with
near
her
rustic
wooden
bridge
professor
pierre
delbet
vouches
for
the
implicit
accuracy
of
this
characteristic
conversation
between
his
mother
and
the
young
of

in
a
french
victory
all
along
the
line
of
the
marne
the
german
retreat
is
general
it
is
astonishing
to
see
how
quietly
and
calmly
parisians
receive
the
welcome
news
they
are
naturally
delighted
but
there
are
no
wild
outbursts
of
enthusiasm
they
fully
realize
that
this
is
merely
one
of
the
phases
of
the
long
hard
struggle
both
joffre
and
the
german
general
staff
foresaw
that
the
great
battle
of
the
marne
must
be
decisive
general
joffre
in
his
order
of
the
day
of
september
impressed
upon
his
troops
that
upon
the
coming
battle
the
salvation
of
the
country
would
depend
and
admonished
his
soldiers
that
if
they
should
be
unable
to
advance
further
they
must
hold
their
ground
or
be
killed
on
the
spot
rather
than
retire
when
the
french
cavalry
made
a
sudden
dash
into
and
entered
the
house
that
had
been
occupied
by
the
headquarters
staff
of
the
eighth
army
corps
which
had
been
hastily
abandoned
a
few
minutes
before
they
found
signed
by
tulff
von
tscheppe
und
werdenbach
a
general
order
which
ran
as
follows
september
the
goal
pursued
by
our
long
and
painful
marches
is
reached
the
principal
french
forces
have
had
to
accept
battle
after
withdrawing
continually
the
great
decision
is
undoubtedly
near
at
hand
therefore
the
total
forces
of
the
german
army
as
well
as
all
those
of
our
army
corps
will
have
to
be
engaged
all
along
the
line
going
from
paris
to
verdun
to
save
the
happiness
and
honor
of
germany
i
expect
from
each
officer
and
soldier
despite
the
hard
and
heroic
fighting
of
the
last
few
days
that
he
will
accomplish
his
duty
entirely
and
to
his
last
breath
all
depends

at
this

met
in

captain

the
military
commanders
at

came
on

the
train
to
ask
if
they
could
be
of
any
service
to
them
and
they
were
saluted
with
enthusiasm
whenever
they
showed
themselves
the
train

to

all
the

went
at

we
were

in
getting
to

is
only
fifty

from

at
achères
the

with
the
northern

two
carloads
of
wounded
were
hitched
to
our

i
found
barricades
on
the
outskirts
of
vernon
and
the
beautiful
bridge
that
had
been
blown
up
by
the
french
in
in
a
vain
attempt
to
prevent
the
german

was
mined
so
that
it
could
be
instantly
destroyed
i
found
my
little

rather
neglected
for
the

who
looks
after
it

wounded
germans
here
receive
exactly
the
same
treatment
as
the
french
the
german
soldiers
were
from
and
saxon
regiments
the
officers
five
altogether
in
a
separate
ward
were
extremely
reticent
and
it
was
only
with
great
difficulty
that
they
could
be
induced
to
give
their
names
and
the
numbers
of
their
regiments
happening
to
speak
german
i
acted
as
interpreter
during
the
inspection
by
the
french
medical
director
these
young
officers
seemed
greatly
depressed
and
mortified
at
finding
themselves
prisoners
while
strolling
about
vernon
i
met
frederick
macmonnies
the
american
sculptor
and
his
wife
riding
on
bicycles
they
had
come
from
giverny
some
three
miles
away
where
macmonnies
has
his
studio
not
far
from
that
of
claude
monet
macmonnies
told
me
that
his
studio
was
now
a
hospital
with
fifty
beds
all
of
which
were
occupied
by
french
and
belgians
macmonnies
aids
the
surgeons
in
tending
the
wounded
during
the
approach
of
the
germans
towards
beauvais
it
was
thought
that
uhlans
would
soon
appear
at
vernon
and
orders
had
been
given
to
evacuate
the
hospitals
macmonnies
buried
his
valuable
tapestries
and
rare
works
of
french
and
italian
renaissance
art
and
prepared
for
the
worst
fortunately
vernon
giverny
paris
and
its
delightful
neighborhood
seems
no
longer
to
be
in
danger
from
invaders
and
the
people
are
recovering
their
peace

paris
has
rarely
seen
so
dense
and
vast
a
throng
as
that
which
assembled
on
sunday
in
the
cathedral
of
notre
dame
for
the
special
service
of
intercession
for
the
success
of
french
arms
when
monseigneur
amette
cardinal
of
paris
preached
a
stirring
sermon
exhorting
people
to
make
extreme
sacrifice
for
their
native
land
there
must
have
been
eight
thousand
persons
in
the
cathedral
not
only
were
the
five
naves
densely
packed
but
all
the
chapels
along
the
side
aisles
were
crowded
with
worshippers
an
imposing
procession
was
formed
including
many
religious
bodies
associations
of
young
girls
and
all
the
roman
catholic
clergy
of
paris
this
cortège
left
the
cathedral
through
the
three
gates
of
the
great
façade
and
took
up
its
position
between
the
basilica
and
the
exterior
railings
here
a
temporary
platform
had
been
erected
from
which
monseigneur
amette
addressed
the
enormous
crowd
that
filled
the
rue
the
pont
notre
dame
and
the
place
notre

right
up
to
the
prefecture
of
police
after
the
cardinal
had
pronounced
the
benediction
the
crowd
joined
with
impressive
solemnity
in
the
invocation
of
joan
of
arc
and
other
saints
on
behalf
of
the
french
armies
and
afterwards
dispersed

the

are
close
on
the

heels
but
as
everybody
in
paris
expected
the
enemy
is
inclined
to
resist
along
their
new
lines
they
are
throwing
up
defences
on
the

from
the

in

from
north
of
rheims
and
the

to
on
the
west
fringe
of
the

the
outlook
seems
so
encouraging
to
the

it
has
returned
to

reduced
its

is
indefatigable
in

the
organization
seems
perfect
the
funds
so
far
subscribed
exceed
five
hundred
and
thousand
francs
during
a
brief
visit
to
the

i
noticed
that
vanderbilt
herself
visited
the

and
with
the
aid
of
her
experienced

prepared

going
to

in

of
a

to
distribute

to

hospital
near
i
had
an
opportunity
to
visit
the
scene
of
the
recent
battles
along
the
ourcq
canal
where
general
von
kluck
army
met
its
first
signal
defeat
we
came
near
to
the
villages
of
chambry
marcilly
etrepilly
and
vincy
along
the
road
from
meaux
to
soissons
and
found
that
the
trenches
dug
by
the
germans
were
filled
with
human
corpses
in
thick
serried
masses
quicklime
and
straw
had
been
thrown
over
them
by
the
ton
piles
of
bodies
of
men
and
of
horses
had
been
partially
cremated
in
the
most
rudimentary
fashion
the
country
seemed
to
be
one
endless
the
stench
of
the
dead
was
appalling
of
the
fifty
odd
houses
that
form
the
village
of
etrepilly
not
one
remained
intact
some
of
them
had
been
hit
by
a
shell
that
penetrated
through
the
roof
falling
into
the
cellar
and
by
its
explosion
bringing
down
from
garret
or
second
story
all
the
furniture
in
one
confused
mass
of
ruin
but
many
other
houses
had
been
simply
sacked
and
looted
cupboards
chests
of
drawers
and
wardrobes
were
smashed
open
and
their
contents
scattered
in
the
streets
courtyards
and
fields
here
was
the
portrait
of
an
ancestor
ripped
to
shreds
by
a
bayonet
there
was
a
child
cradle
an
grandmother
armchair
with
its
cushions
and
lay
smashed
in
fragments
in
the
gutter
the
village
had
fortunately
been
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
at
the
approach
of
the
germans
who
furious
with
rage
had
looted
sacked
or
wantonly
destroyed
whatever
they
found
how
thirsty
the
germans
were
the
roads
and
fields
and
trenches
were
strewn
with
bottles
full
or
the
germans
must
have
been
obliged
to
retreat
suddenly
for
heaps
of
unexploded
shells
for
the
and
german
were
abandoned
and
in
wicker
baskets
were
loads
of
unexploded
shells
apparently
about
to
be
served
to
the
gunners
wanton
ruthless
devastation
everywhere
in
a
field
was
a
wrecked
aeroplane
a
white
and
yellow
with
its
right
wing
reaching
into
the
air
looking
like
some
gigantic
wounded
bird
towards
sunset
an
automobile
passed
along
the
road
through
this
terrible
desolate
valley
of
death
in
it
sat
monseigneur
marbeau
the
venerable
bishop
of
meaux
the
successor
of
bossuet
the
famous
eagle
of
meaux
who
now
and
then
raised
his
right
finger
aloft
and
then
lowered
it
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
as
he
pronounced
benedictions
on
this
vast
a
great
number
of
german
killed
and
wounded
wearing
uniforms
of
the
eleventh
prussian
infantry
regiment
indicated
that
this
corps
had
occupied
the
village
of
etrepilly
as
there
were
no
civilian
villagers
noticed
in
this
part
of
the
country
this
seems
presumptive
evidence
that
the
eleventh
prussian
infantry
participated
in
this
looting
and
wanton
devastation
as
we
were
about
to
return
to
paris
we
met
a
friend
of
gaston
ménier
on
his
way
from
the
latter
near
where
the
memorable
à
take
place
in
the
forest
which
under
normal
conditions
abounds
in
deer
and
stags
the
château
had
been
used
as
the
headquarters
of
a
brigade
of
bavarian
infantry
the
house
was
intact
but
some
valuable
furniture
of
the
louis
xv
period
and
some
paintings
had
been
destroyed
and
the
cellar
that
had
contained
over
two
thousand

of
excellent
wine
including
forty
dozen
bottles
of

of
the
admirable

been

has
failed
nothing

this

the

the

paris
is
coming
to

this

can
only
be

by
an

either

the

the

falls
upon
the

of

and
for
the
present
at

paris
is
no
longer
in
danger
i
see
that
a
change
has
come
over
the
parisians
and
i
can
read
in
their
calm
confident
faces
the
brighter
phase
that
the
war
has
assumed
parisians
of
every
class
from
the
of
the
faubourg
to
the
of
the
rue
de
la

or
the

of

subdued
and
chastened
by
the
sudden
change
that
overtook
their
bright
and

existence
during
this

clamorous

tango

sparkling

boisterous

and

have
all
vanished
the
machinery
of
parisian
life
is
working
at
quarter
speed
streets
are
nearly
deserted
except
for
rapidly
flitting
automobiles
used
mostly
for
military
purposes
the
rue
de

is
a

pathway
where
one
might
play

all

probably
three

the

are

now
and

a

rumbles
along
the

there
is

by
