guy
carleton
first
baron
dorchester
was
born
at
strabane
county
tyrone
on
the
of
september
the
anniversary
of
cromwell
two
great
victories
and
death
he
came
of
a
very
old
family
of
english
country
gentlemen
which
had
migrated
to
ireland
in
the
seventeenth
century
and
intermarried
with
other
families
equally
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
british
crown
guy
father
was
christopher
carleton
of
newry
in
county
down
his
mother
was
catherine
ball
of
county
donegal
his
father
died
comparatively
young
and
when
he
was
himself
fifteen
his
mother
married
the
rector
of
newry
the
reverend
thomas
skelton
whose
influence
over
the
six
of
the
household
worked
wholly
for
their
good
at
eighteen
guy
received
his
first
commission
as
ensign
in
the
foot
then
known
as
lord
rothes
regiment
and
now
as
the
king
own
scottish
borderers
at
he
fought
gallantly
at
the
siege
of
four
years
later
he
was
a
lieutenant
in
the
grenadier
guards
he
was
one
of
those
quiet
men
whose
sterling
value
is
appreciated
only
by
the
few
till
some
crisis
makes
it
stand
forth
before
the
world
at
large
pitt
wolfe
and
george
ii
all
recognized
his
solid
virtues
at
thirty
he
was
still
some
way
down
the
list
of
lieutenants
in
the
grenadiers
while
wolfe
two
years
his
junior
in
age
had
been
four
years
in
command
of
a
battalion
with
the
rank
of
yet
he
had
long
been
friend
carleton
to
wolfe
he
was
soon
to
become
one
of
young
men
and
he
was
enough
of
a
man
to
incur
the
king
displeasure
he
had
criticized
the
hanoverians
and
the
king
never
forgave
him
the
third
george
in
the
name
of
englishman
but
the
first
two
were
hanoverian
all
through
and
for
an
english
guardsman
to
disparage
the
hanoverian
army
was
considered
next
door
to
lady
dorchester
burnt
all
her
husband
private
papers
after
his
death
in
so
we
have
lost
some
of
the
most
intimate
records
concerning
him
but
appears
so
frequently
in
the
letters
of
his
friend
wolfe
that
we
can
see
his
character
as
a
young
man
in
almost
any
aspect
short
of
the
first
reference
has
nothing
to
do
with
affairs
of
state
in
wolfe
aged
twenty
writing
to
miss
lacey
an
english
girl
in
brussels
and
signing
himself
sincerely
your
friend
and
admirer
says
was
doing
the
greatest
injustice
to
the
dear
girls
to
admit
the
least
doubt
of
their
constancy
perhaps
with
respect
to
ourselves
there
may
be
cause
of
complaint
carleton
i
afraid
is
a
recent
example
of
it
from
this
we
may
infer
that
carleton
was
less
as
a
young
man
than
wolfe
found
him
later
on
six
years
afterwards
wolfe
strongly
recommended
him
for
a
position
which
he
had
himself
been
asked
to
fill
that
of
military
tutor
to
the
young
duke
of
richmond
who
was
to
get
a
company
in
wolfe
own
regiment
writing
home
from
paris
in
wolfe
tells
his
mother
that
the
duke
some
skilful
man
to
travel
with
him
through
the
low
countries
and
into
lorraine
i
have
proposed
my
friend
carleton
whom
lord
albemarle
approves
of
lord
albemarle
was
the
british
ambassador
to
france
so
carleton
got
the
post
and
travelled
under
the
happiest
auspices
while
learning
the
frontier
on
which
the
belgian
french
and
british
allies
were
to
fight
the
germans
in
the
great
world
war
of
it
was
during
this
military
tour
of
fortified
places
that
carleton
acquired
the
engineering
skill
which
a
few
years
later
proved
of
such
service
to
the
british
cause
in
canada
in
george
washington
at
that
time
a
young
virginian
officer
of
only
fired
the
first
shot
in
what
presently
became
the
seven
years
war
the
immediate
result
was
disastrous
to
the
british
arms
and
washington
had
to
give
up
the
command
of
the
ohio
by
surrendering
fort
necessity
to
the
french
on
of
all
dates
the
of
july
in
came
braddock
defeat
in
montcalm
arrived
in
canada
and
won
his
first
victory
at
oswego
in
wolfe
distinguished
himself
by
formulating
the
plan
which
if
properly
executed
would
have
prevented
the
british
fiasco
at
rochefort
on
the
coast
of
france
but
carleton
remained
as
undistinguished
as
before
he
simply
became
commanding
the
foot
now
the
seaforth
highlanders
in
his
chance
appeared
to
have
come
at
last
amherst
had
asked
for
his
services
at
louisbourg
but
the
king
had
neither
forgotten
nor
forgiven
the
remarks
about
the
hanoverians
and
so
refused
to
wolfe
great
grief
and
disappointment
it
is
a
public
loss
carleton
not
going
wolfe
confidence
in
carleton
either
as
a
friend
or
as
an
officer
was
stronger
than
ever
writing
to
george
warde
afterwards
the
famous
cavalry
leader
he
said
may
happen
in
the
family
that
may
throw
my
little
affairs
into
disorder
carleton
is
so
good
as
to
say
he
will
give
what
help
is
in
his
power
may
i
ask
the
same
favour
of
you
my
oldest
friend
writing
to
lord
george
sackville
of
whom
we
shall
hear
more
than
enough
at
the
crisis
of
carleton
career
wolfe
said
will
tell
you
his
opinion
of
carleton
by
which
you
will
probably
be
better
convinced
of
our
loss
again
want
grave
carleton
for
every
purpose
of
the
war
and
yet
again
after
the
fall
of
louisbourg
his
majesty
had
thought
proper
to
let
carleton
come
with
us
as
engineer
it
would
have
cut
the
matter
much
shorter
and
we
might
now
be
ruining
the
walls
of
quebec
and
completing
the
conquest
of
new
france
a
little
later
on
wolfe
blazes
out
with
indignation
over
supersession
by
a
junior
sir
john
ligonier
the
allow
his
majesty
to
remain
unacquainted
with
the
merit
of
that
officer
and
can
he
see
such
a
mark
of
displeasure
without
endeavouring
to
soften
or
clear
the
matter
up
a
little
a
man
of
honour
has
the
right
to
expect
the
protection
of
his
colonel
and
of
the
commander
of
the
troops
and
he
ca
serve
without
it
if
i
was
in
carleton
place
i
would
stay
an
hour
in
the
army
after
being
aimed
at
and
distinguished
in
so
remarkable
a
manner
but
carleton
bided
his
time
at
the
beginning
of
wolfe
was
appointed
to
command
the
army
destined
to
besiege
quebec
he
immediately
submitted
carleton
name
for
appointment
as
pitt
and
ligonier
heartily
approved
but
the
king
again
refused
ligonier
went
back
a
second
time
to
no
purpose
pitt
then
sent
him
in
for
the
third
time
saying
in
a
tone
meant
for
the
king
to
overhear
his
majesty
that
in
order
to
render
the
general
wolfe
completely
responsible
for
his
conduct
he
should
be
made
as
far
as
possible
inexcusable
if
he
should
fail
and
that
whatever
an
officer
entrusted
with
such
a
service
of
confidence
requests
ought
therefore
to
be
granted
the
king
then
consented
thus
began
long
devoted
and
successful
service
for
canada
the
empire
and
the
crown
early
in
this
memorable
empire
year
of
he
sailed
with
wolfe
and
saunders
from
spithead
on
the
of
april
the
fleet
rendezvoused
at
halifax
where
admiral
durell
to
saunders
had
spent
the
winter
with
a
squadron
intended
to
block
the
st
lawrence
directly
navigation
opened
in
the
spring
durell
was
a
good
commonplace
officer
but
very
slow
he
had
lost
many
hands
from
sickness
during
a
particularly
cold
season
and
he
was
not
enterprising
enough
to
start
cruising
round
cabot
strait
before
the
month
of
may
saunders
greatly
annoyed
by
this
delay
sent
him
off
with
eight
on
the
of
may
wolfe
gave
him
seven
hundred
soldiers
under
carleton
these
forces
were
sufficient
to
turn
back
capture
or
destroy
the
french
merchantmen
which
were
then
bound
for
quebec
with
supplies
and
soldiers
as
reinforcements
for
montcalm
but
the
french
ships
were
a
week
ahead
of
durell
and
when
he
landed
carleton
at
on
the
of
may
the
last
of
the
enemy
transports
had
already
discharged
her
cargo
at
quebec
sixty
miles
above
so
named
by
jacques
cartier
in
was
a
point
of
great
strategic
importance
for
it
commanded
the
only
channel
then
used
it
was
the
place
wolfe
had
chosen
for
his
winter
quarters
that
is
in
case
of
failure
before
quebec
and
supposing
he
was
not
recalled
none
but
a
particularly
good
officer
would
have
been
appointed
as
its
first
commandant
carleton
spent
many
busy
days
here
preparing
an
advanced
base
for
the
coming
siege
while
the
subsequently
famous
captain
cook
was
equally
busy
of
the
channell
of
the
which
the
fleet
would
have
to
pass
on
its
way
to
quebec
some
of
durell
ships
destroyed
the
french
batteries
near
this
traverse
at
the
lower
end
of
the
island
of
orleans
while
the
rest
kept
ceaseless
watch
to
seaward
anxiously
scanning
the
offing
day
after
day
to
make
out
the
colours
of
the
first
fleet
up
no
one
knew
what
the
french
west
india
fleet
would
do
and
there
was
a
very
disconcerting
chance
that
it
might
run
north
and
slip
into
the
st
lawrence
ahead
of
saunders
in
the
same
way
as
the
french
reinforcements
had
just
slipped
in
ahead
of
durell
presently
at
the
first
streak
of
dawn
on
the
of
june
a
strong
squadron
was
seen
advancing
rapidly
under
a
press
of
sail
instantly
the
officers
of
the
watch
called
all
hands
up
from
below
the
boatswains
whistles
shrilled
across
the
water
as
the
seamen
ran
to
quarters
and
cleared
the
decks
for
action
carleton
camp
was
equally
astir
the
guards
turned
out
the
bugles
sounded
the
men
fell
in
and
waited
then
the
signalled
ashore
that
the
strangers
had
just
answered
correctly
in
private
code
that
all
was
well
and
that
wolfe
and
saunders
were
aboard
next
to
wolfe
himself
carleton
was
the
busiest
man
in
the
army
throughout
the
siege
of
quebec
in
addition
to
his
arduous
and
very
responsible
duties
as
he
acted
as
inspector
of
engineers
and
as
a
officer
for
work
of
an
exceptionally
confidential
nature
as
he
superintended
the
supply
and
transport
branches
considering
that
the
army
was
operating
in
a
devastated
hostile
country
a
thousand
miles
away
from
its
bases
at
halifax
and
louisbourg
and
that
the
interaction
of
the
different
services
naval
and
military
imperial
and
colonial
required
adjustment
to
a
nicety
at
every
turn
it
was
wonderful
that
so
much
was
done
so
well
with
means
which
were
far
from
being
adequate
war
prices
of
course
ruled
in
the
british
camp
but
they
compared
very
favourably
with
the
famine
prices
in
quebec
where
most
soon
became
unobtainable
at
any
price
there
were
no
canteen
or
scandals
under
carleton
then
as
now
every
soldier
had
a
regulation
ration
of
food
and
a
regulation
allowance
for
his
service
kit
but
were
always
acceptable
the
of
these
reads
strangely
to
modern
ears
but
under
the
circumstances
it
was
not
exorbitant
and
it
was
slightly
tempered
by
being
reckoned
in
halifax
currency
of
four
dollars
to
the
pound
instead
of
five
the
british
tommy
atkins
of
that
and
many
a
later
day
thought
canada
a
wonderful
country
for
making
money
go
a
long
way
when
he
could
buy
a
pot
of
beer
for
twopence
and
get
back
thirteen
pence
halifax

as
change
for
his
english
shilling

and

ran
from
ninepence
to
a
shilling

respectively
the
term
did
not
then
mean
noxious
but
only
inferior
it
stood
against
every
article
in
the
no
goods
were
while
carleton
was
the
engineers
were
and
overworked
there
were
no
royal
engineers
as
a
permanent
and
comprehensive
corps
till
the
time
of
wellington
wolfe
complained
bitterly
and
often
of
the
lack
of
men
and
materials
for
scientific
siege
work
but
he
on
carleton
to
good
purpose
in
this
respect
as
well
as
in
many
others
in
his
celebrated
dispatch
to
pitt
he
mentions
carleton
twice
it
was
carleton
whom
he
sent
to
seize
the
west
end
of
the
island
of
orleans
so
as
to
command
the
basin
of
quebec
and
carleton
whom
he
sent
to
take
prisoners
and
gather
information
at
twenty
miles
above
the
city
whether
or
not
he
revealed
the
whole
of
his
final
plan
to
carleton
is
probably
more
than
we
shall
ever
know
since
carleton
papers
were
destroyed
but
we
do
know
that
he
did
not
reveal
it
to
any
one
else
not
even
to
his
three
brigadiers
monckton
townshend
and
murray
carleton
was
wounded
in
the
head
during
the
battle
of
the
plains
but
soon
returned
to
duty
wolfe
showed
his
confidence
in
him
to
the
last
carleton
was
the
only
name
mentioned
twice
in
the
will
which
wolfe
handed
over
to
jervis

future

and

carleton
wolfe
mother
who
died
five
years
later
showed
the
same
confidence
by
appointing
carleton
her
executor
with
the
fall
of
quebec
in
carleton
disappears
from
the
canadian
scene
till
but
so
many
pregnant
events
happened
in
canada
during
these
seven
years
while
so
few
happened
in
his
own
career
that
it
is
much
more
important
for
us
to
follow
her
history
than
his
biography
in
he
was
wounded
at
the
storming
of
port
andro
during
the
attack
on
belle
isle
off
the
west
coast
of
france
in
he
was
wounded
at
havana
in
the
west
indies
after
that
he
enjoyed
four
years
of
quietness
at
home
then
came
the
exceedingly
difficult
task
of
guiding
canada
through
twelve
years
of
turbulent
politics
and
most
subversive
war
chapter
ii
general
murray
both
armies
spent
a
terrible
winter
after
the
battle
of
the
plains
there
was
better
shelter
for
the
french
in
montreal
than
for
the
british
among
the
ruins
of
quebec
but
in
the
matter
of
food
the
positions
were
reversed
nevertheless
the
french
gallantly
refused
the
truce
offered
them
by
murray
who
had
now
succeeded
wolfe
they
were
determined
to
make
a
supreme
effort
to
regain
quebec
in
the
spring
and
they
were
equally
determined
that
the
habitants
should
not
be
free
to
supply
the
british
with
provisions
in
spite
of
the
state
of
war
however
the
french
and
british
officers
even
as
prisoners
and
captors
began
to
make
friends
they
had
found
each
other
foemen
worthy
of
their
steel
a
distinguished
french
officer
the
comte
de
malartic
writing
to
levis
montcalm
successor
said
can
not
speak
too
highly
of
general
murray
although
he
is
our
enemy
murray
on
his
part
was
equally
loud
and
generous
in
his
praise
of
the
french
the
canadian
seigneurs
found
among
the
british
officers
the
priests
and
nuns
of
quebec
found
many
among
the
scottish
and
irish
troops
and
nothing
but
courteous
treatment
from
the
soldiers
of
every
rank
and
form
of
religion
murray
directed
that
compliment

the

of

giving
up
part
of
their

for

poor
while
the
habitants
from
the
surrounding
country
presently
began
to
find
out
that
the
british
were
honest
to
deal
with
and
most
humane
though
sternly
just
as
conquerors
in
the
following
april
levis
made
his
desperate
throw
for
victory
and
actually
did
succeed
in
defeating

but
the

came
up

armies
converged

the

power

stood
despairingly
at

when
levis
found
his
two
thousand
effective
french
regulars
surrounded
by
eight
times
as
many
british
troops
he
had
no
choice
but
to
lay
down
the
arms
of
france
for
ever
on
the
of
september
his
gallant
little
army
was
included
in
the
capitulation
of
montreal
by
which
the
whole
of
canada
passed
into
the
possession
of
the
british
crown
great
britain
had
a
different
general
idea
for
each
one
of
the
four
decades
which
immediately
followed
the
conquest
of
canada
in
the
sixties
the
general
idea
was
to
kill
refractory
old
french
ways
with
a
double
dose
of
new
british
liberty
and
kindness
so
that
canada
might
gradually
become
the
loyal
fourteenth
colony
of
the
empire
in
america
but
the
fates
were
against
this
benevolent
scheme
the
french
canadians
were
firmly
wedded
to
their
old
ways
of
life
except
in
so
far
as
the
new
liberty
enabled
them
to
throw
off
irksome
duties
and
restraints
while
the
new
were
so
few
and
mostly
so
bad
that
they
became
the
cause
of
endless
discord
where
harmony
was
essential
in
the
seventies
the
idea
was
to
restore
the
old
life
so
as
not
only
to
make
canada
proof
against
the
disaffection
of
the
thirteen
colonies
but
also
to
make
her
a
safe
base
of
operations
against
rebellious
americans
in
the
eighties
the
great
concern
of
the
government
was
to
make
a
harmonious
whole
out
of
two
very
widely
differing
parts
the
french
canadians
and
the
newly
arrived
united
empire
loyalists
in
the
nineties
each
of
these
parts
was
set
to
work
out
its
own
salvation
under
its
own
provincial
constitution

only

seven

james
murray
the
first
british
governor
of
canada
was
a
younger
son
of
the
fourth
lord
elibank
he
was
just
over
forty
and
an
excellent
french
scholar
and
every
inch
a
soldier
he
had
been
a

the
defence

was
a

side

him
later

old
antagonist

wolfe
knew
a
good
man
when
he
saw
one
and
gave
his
full
confidence
to
his
antagonist
both
at
louisbourg
and
quebec
murray
was
not
born
under
a
lucky
star
he
saw
three
defeats
in
three
successive
wars
he
began
his
service
with
the
abortive
attack
on
pestilential
cartagena
where
wolfe
father
was
present
as
in
he
lost

he
was

distinguished
for
honour
and
steadfastness
on
all
occasions
an
admiring
contemporary
described
him
as
a
model
of
all
the
military
virtues
except
prudence
but
he
had
more
prudence
and
less
genius
than
his
admirer
thought
and
he
showed
a
marked
talent
for
general
government
the
problem
before
him
was
harder
than
his
superiors
could
believe
he
was
expected
to
prepare
for
assimilation
some
thousand
subjects
who
were
mostly
alien
in
religion
and
wholly
alien
in
every
other
way
but
for
the
moment
this
proved
the
least
of
his
many
difficulties
because
no
immediate
results
were
required
while
the
war
went
on
in
europe
canada
remained
nominally
a
part
of
the
enemy
dominions
and
so
of
course
was
subject
to
military
rule

threw
himself
into

assembled

the
british
towards
their
new
possession
canada
had
been
conquered
by
great
britain
with
some
help
from
the
american
colonies
for
three
main
reasons
first
to
strike
a
at
french
dominion
in
america
secondly
to
increase
the
opportunities
of
british
seaborne
trade
and
thirdly
to
enlarge
the
area
available
for
british
settlement
when
murray
was
instructed
to
prepare
a
report
on
canada
he
had
to
keep
all
this
in
mind
for
the
government
wished
to
satisfy
the
public
both
at
home
and
in
the
colonies
he
had
to
examine
the
military
strength
of
the
country
and
the
disposition
of
its
population
in
case
of
future
wars
with
france
he
had
to
satisfy
the
natural
curiosity
of
men
like
the
london
merchants
and
he
had
to
show
how
and
where
settlers
could
go
in
and
make
canada
not
only
a
british
possession
but
the
fourteenth
british
colony
in

burton
and

were
also
instructed
to
report
about
their
own
districts
of

the
documents
they
prepared
were
tacked
on
to
murray
by
june
the
work
was
completed
and
sent
on
to

sent
it
to
england
in
ample
time
to
be
studied
there
before
the
opening
of
the
impending
negotiations
for

murray
was
greatly
concerned
about
the
military
strength
of
quebec
then
as
always
the
key
of
canada
like
the
unfortunate
montcalm
he
found
the
walls
of
quebec
badly
built
badly
placed
and
falling
into
ruins
and
he
thought
they
could
not
be
defended
by
three
thousand
men
against
well
conducted
he
proposed
to
crown
cape
diamond
with
a
proper
citadel
which
would
overawe
the
disaffected
in
quebec
itself
and
defend
the
place
against
an
outside
enemy
long
enough
to
let
a
british
fleet
come
up
to
its
relief
the
rest
of
the
country
was
defended
by
little
garrisons
at
three
rivers
and
montreal
as
well
as
by
several
small
detachments
distributed
among
the
where
the
white
men
and
the
red
met
in
the
depths
of
the
western
wilderness
the
relations
between
the
british
garrison
and
the
french
canadians
were
so
excellent
that
what
gage
reported
from
montreal
might
be
taken
as
equally
true
of
the
rest
of
the
country
soldiers
live
peaceably
with
the
inhabitants
and
they
reciprocally
acquire
an
affection
for
each
other

french
canadians
numbered
thousand
altogether
exclusive
of
the
fur
traders
and
coureurs
de
bois
barely
fifteen
thousand
lived
in
the
three
little
towns
of
quebec
montreal
and
three
rivers
while
over
fifty
thousand
lived
in
the
country
nearly
all
the
officials
had
gone
back
to
france
the
three
classes
of
greatest
importance
were
the
seigneurs
the
clergy
and
the
habitants
the
lawyers
were
not
of
much
account
the
petty
commercial
classes
of
less
account
still
the
coureurs
de
bois
and
other
fur
traders
formed
an
important
link
between
the
savage
and
the
civilized
life
of
the
country
apart
from
furs
the
trade
of
canada
was
contemptibly
small
in
the
eyes
of
men
like
the
london
merchants
but
the
opportunity
of
fostering
all
the
fur
trade
that
could
be
carried
down
the
st
lawrence
was
very
well
worth
while
and
if
there
was
no
other
existing
trade
worth
capturing
there
seemed
to
be
some
kinds
worth
creating
murray
held
out
hopes
of
the
fisheries
and
forests
most
immense
cod
fishery
can
be
established
in
the
river
and
gulph
of
st
lawrence
a
rich
tract
of
country
on
the
south
side
of
the
gulph
will
be
settled
and
improved
and
a
port
or
ports
furnished
with
every
material
requisite
to
repair
ships
he
then
went
on
to
enumerate
the
other
kinds
of
fishery
the
abundance
of
whales
seals
and
walruses
in
the
gulf
and
of
salmon
up
all
the
tributary
rivers
burton
recommends
immediate
attention
to
the
iron
mines
behind
three
rivers
all
the
governors
expatiate
on
the
vast
amount
of
forest
wealth
and
remind
the
home
government
that
under
the
french
regime
the
king
when
making
out
patents
for
the
seigneurs
reserved
the
right
of
taking
wood
for
and
fortifications
from
any
of
the
seigneuries
agriculture
was
found
to
be
in
a
very
backward
state
the
habitants
would
raise
no
more
than
they
required
for
their
own
use
and
for
a
little
local
trade
but
the
fault
was
attributed
to
the
gambling
attractions
of
the
fur
trade
to
the
bad
governmental
system
and
to
the
frequent
interruptions
of
the
a
kind
of
forced
labour
which
was
meant
to
serve
the
public
interest
but
which
bigot
and
other
thievish
officials
always
turned
to
their
own
private
advantage
on
the
whole
the
reports
were
most
encouraging
in
the
prospects
they
held
out
to
honest
labour
trade
and
government
while
murray
and
his
lieutenants
had
been
collecting
information
for
their
reports
the
home
government
had
been
undergoing
many
changes
for
the
worse
the
pitt
had
gone
out
of
power
and
the
politician
bute
had
come
in
pitt
and
expensive
war
the
war
that
more
than
any
other
laid
the
foundations
of
the
present
british
empire
was
to
be
ended
on
any
terms
the
country
could
be
persuaded
to
bear
thus
the
end
of
the
seven
years
war
or
as
the
british
part
of
it
was
more
correctly
called
the
war
was
no
more
glorious
in
statesmanship
than
its
beginning
had
been
in
arms
but
the
spirit
of
its
mighty
heart
still
lived
on
in
the
empire
grateful
memories
of
pitt
and
quickened
the
world
enough
to
prevent
any
really
disgraceful
surrender
of
the
fruits
of
victory
the
treaty
of
paris
signed
on
the
of
february
and
the
king
proclamation
published
in
october
were
duly
followed
by
the
inauguration
of
civil
government
in
canada
the
incompetent
bute
anxious
to
get
pitt
out
of
the
way
tried
to
induce
him
to
become
the
first
british
governor
of
the
new
colony
even
bute
probably
never
dared
to
hope
that
pitt
would
actually
go
out
to
canada
but
he
did
hope
to
lower
his
prestige
by
making
him
the
holder
of
a
sinecure
at
home
however
this
may
be
pitt
mightiest
of
all
parliamentary
ministers
of
war
refused
to
be
made
either
a
jobber
or
an
exile
whereupon
position
was
changed
from
a
military
command
into
that
of
and
the
changes
which
ensued
in
the
laws
of
canada
were
heartily
welcomed
so
far
as
the
adoption
of
the
humaner
criminal
code
of
england
was
concerned
the
new
laws
relating
to
debtor
and
creditor
also
gave
general
satisfaction
except
as
we
shall
presently
see
when
they
involved
imprisonment
for
debt
but
the
tentative
efforts
to
introduce
english
civil
law
side
by
side
with
the
old
french
code
resulted
in
great
confusion
and
much
discontent
the
land
laws
had
become
so
unworkable
under
this
dual
system
that
they
had
to
be
left
as
they
were
a
court
of
common
pleas
was
set
up
specially
for
the
benefit
of
the
french
canadians
if
either
party
demanded
a
jury
one
had
to
be
sworn
in
and
french
canadians
were
to
be
jurors
on
equal
terms
with
king
old
subjects
the
roman
catholic
church
was
to
be
completely
tolerated
but
not
in
any
way
established
lord
egremont
in
giving
the
king
instructions
to
murray
reminded
him
that
the
proviso
in
the
treaty
of
paris
far
as
the
laws
of
great
britain
should
govern
his
action
whenever
disputes
arose
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
last
jacobite
rising
was
then
a
comparatively
recent
affair
and
that
france
was
equally
ready
to
upset
either
the
protestant
succession
in
england
or
the
british
regime
in
canada
the
indians
were
also
an
object
of
special
solicitude
in
the
royal
proclamation
indians
who
live
under
our
protection
should
not
be
molested
in
the
possession
of
such
parts
of
our
dominions
and
territories
as
not
having
been
ceded
to
or
purchased
by
us
are
reserved
to
them
the
home
government
was
far
in
advance
of
the
american
colonists
in
its
humane
attitude
towards
the
indians
the
common
american
attitude
then
and
long
afterwards
indeed
up
to
a
time
well
within
living
memory
was
that
indians
were
a
kind
of
human
vermin
to
be
exterminated
without
mercy
unless
of
course
more
money
was
to
be
made
out
of
them
alive
the
result
was
an
endless
struggle
along
the
frontier
of
the
west
and
just
at
this
particular
time
the
of
pontiac
had
brought
about
something
like
a
real
war
the
story
of
this
great
effort
of
the
indians
to
stem
the
encroachments
of
the
exterminating
colonists
is
told
in
another
chronicle
of
the
present
series
footnote
the
war
chief
of
the
ottawas
the
french
traders
in
the
west
undoubtedly
had
a
hand
in
stirring
up
the
indians
pontiac
a
sort
of
indian
napoleon
was
undoubtedly
cruel
as
well
as
crafty
and
the
indians
undoubtedly
fought
just
as
the
ancestors
of
the
french
and
british
used
to
fight
when
they
were
at
the
corresponding
stage
of
social
evolution
but
the
mere
fact
that
so
many
jealously
distinct
tribes
united
in
this
common
cause
proves
how
much
they
all
must
have
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
colonists
while
pontiac
war
continued
in
the
west
murray
had
to
deal
with
a
political
war
in
canada
which
rose
to
its
height
in
the
king
proclamation
of
the
previous
october
had
express
power
to
our
governor
that
so
soon
as
the
state
and
circumstances
of
the
said
colony
will
admit
thereof
he
shall
call
a
general
assembly
in
such
manner
and
form
as
is
used
in
those
colonies
and
provinces
in
america
which
are
under
our
immediate
government
the
intention
of
establishing
parliamentary
institutions
was
therefore
perfectly
clear
but
it
was
equally
clear
that
the
introduction
of
such
institutions
was
to
depend
on
and
it
is
well
to
remember
here
that
these
were
not
held
to
warrant
the
opening
of
a
canadian
parliament
till
now
the
military
government
had
been
a
great
success
there
was
every
reason
to
suppose
that
civil
government
by
a
governor
and
council
would
be
the
next
best
thing
and
it
was
quite
certain
that
calling
a
assembly
at
once
would
defeat
the
very
ends
which
such
bodies
are
designed
to
serve
more
than
per
cent
of
the
population
were
dead
against
an
assembly
which
none
of
them
understood
and
all
distrusted
on
the
other
hand
the
clamorous
minority
of
less
than
one
per
cent
were
in
favour
only
of
a
parliament
from
which
the
majority
should
be
rigorously
excluded
even
if
possible
as
voters
the
immense
majority
comprised
the
entire
community
the
absurdly
small
minority
consisted
mostly
of
americanized
traders
who
having
come
to
fish
in
troubled
waters
naturally
wanted
the
laws
made
to
suit
poachers
the
british
garrison
the
governing
officials
and
the
very
few
other
people
of
a
more
enlightened
class
all
looked
down
on
the
rancorous
minority
the
whole
question
resolved
itself
into
this
should
canada
be
handed
over
to
the
licensed
exploitation
of
a
few
hundred
who
had
done
nothing
to
win
her
for
the
british
empire
who
were
despised
by
those
who
had
and
who
promised
to
be
a
dangerous
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
new
colony
what
this
ridiculous
minority
of
really
wanted
was
not
a
parliament
but
a
rump
many
a
representative
assembly
has
ended
in
a
rump
the
wished
to
begin
with
one
and
stop
there
it
might
be
supposed
that
such
pretensions
would
defeat
themselves
but
there
was
a
twofold
difficulty
in
the
way
of
getting
the
truth
understood
by
the
public
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
in
the
first
place
the
french
canadians
were
practically
dumb
to
the
outside
world
in
the
second
the
vociferous
rumpites
had
the
ear
of
some
english
and
more
american
commercial
people
who
were
not
anxious
to
understand
while
the
great
mass
of
the
general
public
were
inclined
to
think
if
they
ever
thought
at
all
that
parliamentary
government
must
mean
more
liberty
for
every
one
concerned
a
singularly
apt
commentary
on
the
pretensions
of
the
is
supplied
by
the
famous
or
infamous
of
the
grand
jury
of
quebec
in
october
the
moving
spirits
of
this
precious
jury
were
aspirants
to
membership
in
the
strictly
exclusive
rumpish
little
parliament
of
their
own
seeking
the
signatures
of
the
members
were
obtained
by
fraud
as
was
subsequently
proved
by
a
sworn
official
protestation
the
first
presentment
tells
its
own
tale
as
it
refers
to
the
only
courts
in
which
lawyers
were
allowed
to
plead
great
number
of
inferior
courts
are
tiresome
litigious
and
expensive
to
this
poor
colony
then
came
a
hit
at
the
previous
military
rule
decrees
of
the
military
courts
may
be
amended
after
having
been
confirmed
by
legal
ordinance
by
allowing
appeals
if
the
matter
decided
exceed
ten
pounds
which
would
put
it
out
of
the
reach
of
the
courts
and
into
the
clutches
of
king
old
subjects
but
the
gist
of
it
all
was
contained
in
the
following
represent
that
as
the
grand
jury
must
be
considered
at
present
as
the
only
body
representative
of
the
colony
we
propose
that
the
publick
accounts
be
laid
before
the
grand
jury
at
least
twice
a
year
that
the
grand
jury
was
to
be
purged
of
all
its
members
is
evident
from
the
addendum
slipped
in
behind
their
backs
this
addendum
is
a
fine
specimen
of
verbose
invective
against
church
of
rome
the
pope
bulls
briefs
absolutions
the
empanelling
grand
and
petty
jurys
of
or
popish
recusants
convict
and
so
on
the
of
the
grand
jury
was
presently
followed
by
humble
petition
of
your
majesty
most
faithful
and
loyal
subjects
british
merchants
and
traders
in
behalf
of
themselves
and
their
fellow
subjects
inhabitants
of
your
majesty
province
of
fellow
subjects
did
not
of
course
include
any
or
popish
recusants
convict
among
the
and
distresses
enumerated
were
oppressive
and
severely
felt
military
government
the
inability
to
the
fruit
of
our
industry
under
such
a
martinet
as
murray
who
in
one
paragraph
is
accused
of
dutyfull
remonstrances
in
silence
and
in
the
next
of
them
with
a
rage
and
rudeness
of
language
and
demeanor
as
dishonourable
to
the
trust
he
holds
of
your
majesty
as
painfull
to
those
who
suffer
from
it
finally
the
petitioners
solemnly
warn
his
majesty
that
their
in
the
province
are
so
very
unhappy
that
we
must
be
under
the
necessity
of
removing
from
it
unless
timely
prevented
by
a
removal
of
the
present
governor
in
forwarding
this
document
murray
poured
out
the
vials
of
his
wrath
on
licentious
fanaticks
trading
here
while
he
boldly
championed
the
cause
of
the
french
canadians
race
who
could
they
be
indulged
with
a
few
priveledges
which
the
laws
of
england
deny
to
roman
catholicks
at
home
would
soon
get
the
better
of
every
national
antipathy
to
their
conquerors
and
become
the
most
faithful
and
most
useful
set
of
men
in
this
american
empire
while
these
charges
and
were
crossing
the
atlantic
another
and
much
more
violent
trouble
came
to
a
head
as
there
were
no
barracks
in
canada
billeting
was
a
necessity
it
was
made
as
little
burdensome
as
possible
and
the
houses
of
magistrates
were
specially
exempt
this
however
did
not
prevent
the
magistrates
from
baiting
the
military
whenever
they
got
the
chance
fines
imprisonments
and
other
sentences
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
offence
committed
were
heaped
on
every
redcoat
in
much
the
same
way
as
was
then
being
practised
in
boston
and
other
hotbeds
of
disaffection
the
redcoats
had
done
their
work
in
ridding
america
of
the
old
french
menace
they
were
doing
it
now
in
ridding
the
colonies
of
the
last
serious
menace
from
the
indians
and
so
the
colonists
having
no
further
use
for
them
began
trying
to
make
the
land
they
had
delivered
too
hot
to
hold
them
there
were
of
course
exceptions
and
the
american
colonists
had
some
real
as
well
as
pretended
grievances
but
wantonly
baiting
the
redcoats
had
already
become
a
most
discreditable
general
practice
montreal
was
most
in
touch
with
the
disaffected
people
to
the
south
it
also
had
a
magistrate
of
the
name
of
walker
the
most
rancorous
of
all
the
disaffected
magistrates
in
canada
this
walker
well
mated
with
an
equally
rancorous
wife
was
the
same
man
who
entertained
benjamin
franklin
and
the
other
commissioners
sent
by
congress
into
canada
in
the
year
in
which
both
the
american
republic
and
a
truly
british
canada
were
born
he
would
not
have
been
flattered
could
he
have
seen
the
entry
franklin
made
about
him
and
his
wife
in
a
diary
which
is
still
extant
the
gist
of
it
was
that
wherever
the
walkers
might
be
they
would
soon
set
the
place
by
the
ears
walker
of
course
was
foremost
in
the
persecution
of
the
redcoats
and
he
eagerly
seized
his
opportunity
when
an
officer
was
billeted
in
a
house
where
a
brother
magistrate
happened
to
be
living
as
a
lodger
under
such
circumstances
the
magistrate
could
not
claim
exemption
but
this
made
no
difference
either
to
him
or
to
walker
captain
payne
the
gentleman
whose
presence
enraged
these
boors
was
seized
and
thrown
into
gaol
the
chief
justice
granted
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
but
the
mischief
was
done
and
resentment
waxed
high
the
seigneurs
sympathized
with
payne
which
added
fuel
to
the
magisterial
flame
and
murray
scenting
danger
summoned
the
whole
bench
down
to
quebec
but
before
this
bench
of
bumbles
started
some
masked
men
seized
walker
in
his
own
house
and
gave
him
a
good
sound
thrashing
unfortunately
they
spoilt
the
fair
reprisal
by
cutting
off
his
ear
that
very
night
the
news
had
run
round
montreal
and
made
a
start
for
boston
and
quebec
feeling
ran
high
and
higher
still
when
a
few
weeks
later
the
civil
magistrates
vented
their
rage
on
several
redcoats
by
imposing
sentences
exceeding
even
the
utmost
limits
of
their
previous
vindictive
action
montreal
became
lest
the
soldiers
baited
past
endurance
should
break
out
in
open
violence
murray
drove
up
from
quebec
ordered
the
affected
regiment
to
another
station
reproved
the
offending
magistrates
and
public
confidence
official
and
private
rewards
were
offered
to
any
witnesses
who
would
identify
walker
assailants
but
in
vain
the
smouldering
fire
burst
out
again
under
carleton
but
the
mystery
was
never
cleared
up
things
had
now
come
to
a
crisis
the
london
merchants
knowing
nothing
about
the
internal
affairs
of
canada
backed
the
petition
of
the
quebec
traders
who
were
quite
unworthy
of
such
support
from
men
of
real
business
probity
and
knowledge
the
magisterial
faction
in
canada
advertised
their
side
of
the
case
all
over
the
colonies
and
in
any
sympathetic
quarter
they
could
find
in
england
the
seigneurs
sent
home
a
warm
defence
of
murray
and
murray
himself
sent
cramahe
a
very
able
swiss
officer
in
the
british
army
the
home
government
thus
had
plenty
of
contradictory
evidence
before
it
in
the
result
was
that
murray
was
called
home
in
rather
in
a
spirit
of
and
sympathetic
inquiry
into
his
conduct
than
with
any
idea
of
censuring
him
he
never
returned
to
canada
but
as
he
held
the
titular
governorship
for
some
time
longer
and
as
he
was
afterwards
employed
in
positions
of
great
responsibility
and
trust
the
verdict
of
the
home
authorities
was
clearly
given
in
his
favour
the
troublous
year
of
saw
another
innovation
almost
as
revolutionary
compared
with
the
old
regime
as
the
introduction
of
civil
government
itself
this
was
the
issue
of
the
first
newspaper
in
canada
where
indeed
it
was
also
the
first
printed
thing
of
any
kind
nova
scotia
had
produced
an
earlier
paper
the
which
lived
an
intermittent
life
from
to
but
no
press
had
ever
been
allowed
in
new
france
the
few
documents
that
required
printing
had
always
been
done
in
the
mother
country
brown
and
gilmore
two
philadelphians
were
thus
undertaking
a
pioneer
business
when
they
announced
that
design
is
in
case
we
are
fortunate
enough
to
succeed
early
in
this
spring
to
settle
in
this
city
quebec
in
the
capacity
of
printers
and
forthwith
to
publish
a
weekly
newspaper
in
french
and
english
the
which
first
appeared
on
the
of
the
following
june
has
continued
to
the
present
time
though
it
is
now
a
daily
and
is
known
as
the
centenarian
papers
are
not
common
in
any
country
and
those
that
have
lived
over
a
century
and
a
half
are
very
few
indeed
so
the
which
is
the
second
surviving
senior
in
america
is
also
among
the
great
press
seniors
of
the
world
the
original
number
is
one
of
the
curiosities
of
journalism
the
publishers
felt
tolerably
sure
of
having
what
was
then
considered
a
good
deal
of
recent
news
for
their
three
hundred
readers
during
the
open
season
but
knowing
that
the
supply
would
be
both
short
and
stale
in
winter
they
held
out
prospects
of
a
canadian
or
without
however
being
rash
enough
to
promise
a
supply
of
addisons
and
steeles
their
announcement
makes
curious
reading
at
the
present
day
the
rigour
of
winter
preventing
the
arrival
of
ships
from
and
in
a
great
measure
interrupting
the
ordinary
intercourse
with
the
southern
provinces
it
will
be
necessary
in
a
paper
designed
for
general
perusal
and
publick
utility
to
provide
some
things
of
general
entertainment
independent
of
foreign
intelligence
we
shall
therefore
on
such
occasions
present
our
readers
with
such
both
in
and
as
will
please
the
fancy
and
instruct
the
judgment
and
here
we
beg
leave
to
observe
that
we
shall
have
nothing
so
much
at
heart
as
the
support
of
virtue
and
morality
and
the
noble
cause
of
liberty
the
refined
amusements
of
literature
and
the
pleasing
veins
of
well
pointed
wit
shall
also
be
considered
as
necessary
to
this
collection
interspersed
with
chosen
pieces
and
curious
essays
extracted
from
the
most
celebrated
authors
so
that
blending
philosophy
with
politicks
history
the
youth
of
both
sexes
will
be
improved
and
persons
of
all
ranks
agreeably
and
usefully
entertained
and
upon
the
whole
we
will
labour
to
attain
to
all
the
exactness
that
so
much
variety
will
permit
and
give
as
much
variety
as
will
consist
with
a
reasonable
exactness
and
as
this
part
of
our
project
can
not
be
carried
into
execution
without
the
correspondence
of
the
ingenious
we
shall
take
all
opportunities
of
acknowledging
our
obligations
to
those
who
take
the
trouble
of
furnishing
any
matter
which
shall
tend
to
entertainment
or
instruction
our
intentions
to
please
the
without
offence
to
any
will
be
better
evinced
by
our
practice
than
by
writing
volumes
on
the
subject
this
one
thing
we
beg
may
be
believed
that
party
prejudice
or
private
scandal
will
never
find
a
place
in
this
paper
governor
carleton
the
twelve
years
of
carleton
first
administration
naturally
fall
into
three
distinct
periods
of
equal
length
during
the
first
he
was
busily
employed
settling
as
many
difficulties
as
he
could
examining
the
general
state
of
the
country
and
gradually
growing
into
the
change
that
was
developing
in
the
minds
of
the
home
government
the
change
that
is
from
the
americanizing
sixties
to
the
seventies
during
the
second
period
he
was
in
england
helping
to
shape
the
famous
quebec
act
during
the
third
he
was
defending
canada
from
american
attack
and
aiding
the
british
counterstroke
by
every
means
in
his
power
on
the
of
september
carleton
arrived
at
quebec
and
began
his
thirty
years
experience
as
a
canadian
administrator
by
taking
over
the
government
from
colonel
irving
who
had
held
it
since
murray
departure
in
the
spring
irving
had
succeeded
murray
simply
because
he
happened
to
be
the
senior
officer
present
at
the
time
carleton
himself
was
technically
murray
lieutenant
till
but
neither
of
these
facts
really
affected
the
course
of
canadian
history
the
council
the
magistrates
and
the
traders
each
presented
the
new
governor
with
an
address
containing
the
usual
professions
of
loyal
devotion
carleton
remarked
in
his
dispatch
that
these
separate
addresses
and
the
marked
absence
of
any
united
address
showed
how
much
the
population
was
divided
he
also
noted
that
a
good
many
of
the
minority
had
objected
to
the
addresses
on
account
of
their
own
opposition
to
the
stamp
act
and
that
there
had
been
some
broken
heads
in
consequence
troubles
enough
soon
engaged
his
anxious
attention
troubles
over
the
indian
trade
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
the
canadian
jesuits
the
wounded
dignity
of
some
members
of
the
council
and
the
still
smouldering
and
ever
mysterious
walker
affair
the
strife
between
canada
and
the
thirteen
colonies
over
the
indian
trade
of
the
west
remained
the
same
in
principle
as
under
the
old
regime
the
conquest
had
merely
changed
the
old
rivalry
between
two
foreign
powers
into
one
between
two
widely
differing
british
possessions
and
this
because
of
the
general
unrest
among
the
americans
made
the
competition
more
bitter
if
possible
than
ever
the
jesuits
pressed
their
claims
for
recognition
for
their
original
estates
and
for
compensation
but
their
order
had
fallen
on
evil
days
all
over
the
world
it
was
not
popular
even
in
canada
and
the
arrangement
was
that
while
the
existing
members
were
to
be
treated
with
every
consideration
the
society
itself
was
to
be
allowed
to
die
out
the
offended
councillors
went
so
far
as
to
present
carleton
with
a
remonstrance
which
irving
himself
had
the
misfortune
to
sign
carleton
had
consulted
some
members
on
points
with
which
they
were
specially
acquainted
the
members
who
had
not
been
consulted
thereupon
protested
to
irving
who
assured
them
that
carleton
must
have
done
so
by
accident
not
design
but
when
carleton
received
a
joint
letter
in
which
they
said
you
are
pleased
to
signifye
to
us
by
coll
irving
that
it
was
accident
not
intention
he
at
once
replied
lieutenant
colonel
irving
has
signified
to
you
that
the
part
of
my
conduct
you
think
worthy
of
your
reprehension
happened
by
accident
let
him
explain
his
reasons
for
so
doing
he
had
no
authority
from
me
carleton
then
went
on
to
say
that
he
would
consult
any
of
good
sense
truth
candour
and
impartial
justice
whenever
he
chose
no
matter
whether
they
were
councillors
or
not
the
walker
affair
which
now
broke
out
again
was
much
more
serious
than
the
storm
in
the
council
teacup
it
agitated
the
whole
of
canada
and
threatened
to
range
the
population
of
montreal
and
quebec
into
two
irreconcilable
factions
the
civil
and
the
military
for
the
whole
of
the
two
years
since
murray
had
been
called
upon
to
deal
with
it
cleverly
presented
versions
of
walker
views
had
been
spread
all
over
the
colonies
and
worked
into
influential
opposition
circles
in
england
the
invectives
against
the
redcoats
and
their
friends
the
seigneurs
were
of
the
usual
abusive
type
but
they
had
an
unusually
powerful
effect
at
that
particular
time
in
the
thirteen
colonies
as
well
as
in
what
their
authors
hoped
to
make
a
fourteenth
colony
after
a
fashion
of
their
own
and
they
looked
plausible
enough
to
mislead
a
good
many
moderate
men
in
the
mother
country
too
walker
case
was
that
he
had
an
actual
witness
as
to
the
identity
of
his
assailants
in
the
person
of
mcgovoch
a
discharged
soldier
who
laid
information
against
one
civilian
three
british
officers
and
the
celebrated
leader
la
corne
de
st
luc
all
the
accused
were
arrested
in
their
beds
in
montreal
and
thrown
into
the
common
gaol
walker
objected
to
bail
on
the
plea
that
his
life
would
be
in
danger
if
they
were
allowed
at
large
he
also
sought
to
postpone
the
trial
in
order
to
punish
the
accused
as
much
as
possible
guilty
or
innocent
but
william
hey
the
chief
justice
an
able
and
upright
man
would
consent
to
postponement
only
on
condition
that
bail
should
be
allowed
so
the
trial
proceeded
when
the
grand
jury
threw
out
the
case
against
one
of
the
prisoners
walker
let
loose
such
a
flood
of
virulent
abuse
that
moderate
men
were
turned
against
him
in
the
end
all
the
accused
were
honourably
acquitted
while
mcgovoch
who
was
proved
to
have
been
a
false
witness
from
the
first
was
convicted
of
perjury
carleton
remained
absolutely
impartial
all
through
and
even
dismissed
colonel
irving
and
another
member
of
the
council
for
heading
a
petition
on
behalf
of
the
military
prisoners
the
walker
affair
was
an
instance
of
a
bad
case
in
which
the
law
at
last
worked
well
but
there
were
many
others
in
which
it
did
not
what
with
the
de
which
is
still
quoted
in
the
province
of
quebec
the
other
complexities
of
the
old
french
law
the
doubtful
meanings
drawn
from
the
capitulation
the
treaty
the
proclamation
and
the
various
ordinances
the
instinctive
opposition
between
the
french
canadians
and
the
civilians
and
finally
what
with
the
portents
of
subversive
change
that
were
already
beginning
to
overshadow
all
america
what
with
all
this
and
more
carleton
found
himself
faced
with
a
problem
which
no
man
could
have
solved
to
the
satisfaction
of
every
one
concerned
each
side
in
a
lawsuit
took
whatever
amalgam
of
french
and
english
codes
was
best
for
its
own
argument
but
generally
speaking
the
ingrained
feeling
of
the
french
canadians
was
against
any
change
of
their
own
laws
that
was
not
visibly
and
immediately
beneficial
to
their
own
particular
interests
moreover
the
use
of
the
unknown
english
language
the
worthlessness
of
the
rapacious
magistrates
and
the
detested
innovation
of
imprisonment
for
debt
all
combined
to
make
every
part
of
english
civil
law
hated
simply
because
it
happened
to
be
english
and
not
french
the
home
authorities
were
anxious
to
find
some
workable
compromise
in
carleton
exchanged
several
important
dispatches
with
them
and
in
they
sent
out
maurice
morgan
to
study
and
report
after
consultation
with
the
chief
justice
and
well
instructed
persons
morgan
was
an
indefatigable
and
man
who
deserves
to
be
gratefully
remembered
by
both
races
for
he
was
a
good
friend
both
to
the
french
canadians
before
the
quebec
act
and
to
the
united
empire
loyalists
just
before
their
great
migration
when
he
was
carleton
secretary
at
new
york
in
the
official
correspondence
entered
the
and
stage
with
a
dispatch
from
the
home
government
to
carleton
suggesting
a
house
of
representatives
to
which
practically
speaking
the
towns
would
send
protestant
members
and
the
country
districts
roman
catholics
in
carleton
sailed
for
england
he
carried
a
good
deal
of
experience
with
him
both
on
this
point
and
on
many
others
he
went
home
with
a
strong
opinion
not
only
against
an
assembly
but
against
any
immediate
attempts
at
anglicization
in
any
form
the
royal
instructions
that
had
accompanied
his
commission
as
and
in
contained
directions
for
establishing
the
church
of
england
with
a
view
to
converting
the
whole
population
to
its
tenets
later
on
but
no
steps
had
been
taken
and
needless
to
say
the
french
canadians
remained
as
roman
catholic
as
ever
an
increasingly
important
question
soon
to
overshadow
all
others
was
defence
in
april
carleton
had
proposed
the
restoration
of
the
seigneurial
militia
system
the
lands
here
are
held
of
his
castle
of
st
lewis
the
governor
official
residence
in
quebec
the
oath
which
the
vassals
seigneurs
take
is
very
solemn
and
binding
they
are
obliged
to
appear
in
arms
for
the
king
defence
in
case
his
province
is
attacked
carleton
pointed
out
that
a
hundred
men
of
the
canadian
seigneurial
families
were
being
kept
on
full
pay
in
france
ready
to
return
and
raise
the
canadians
at
the
first
opportunity
the
other
hand
there
are
only
about
seventy
of
these
officers
in
canada
who
have
been
in
the
french
service
not
one
of
them
has
been
given
a
commission
in
the
king
george
service
nor
is
there
one
who
from
any
motive
whatever
is
induced
to
support
his
government
the
few
french
canadians
raised
for
pontiac
war
had
of
course
been
properly
paid
during
the
continuance
of
their
active
service
but
they
had
been
disbanded
like
mere
militia
afterwards
without
either
gratuities
or
for
the
officers
this
naturally
made
the
class
from
which
officers
were
drawn
think
that
no
career
was
open
to
them
under
the
union
jack
and
turned
their
thoughts
towards
france
where
their
fellows
were
enjoying
full
pay
without
a
break
what
made
this
the
more
serious
was
the
weakness
of
the
regular
garrisons
all
of
which
put
together
numbered
only
men
carleton
calculated
that
about
five
hundred
of
king
old
subjects
were
capable
of
bearing
arms
though
most
of
them
were
better
at
talking
than
fighting
he
had
nothing
but
contempt
for
flimsy
wall
round
montreal
and
relied
little
more
on
the
very
defective
works
at
quebec
thus
with
all
his
wonderful
equanimity
carleton
left
canada
with
no
light
heart
when
he
took
six
months
leave
of
absence
in
and
he
would
have
been
more
anxious
still
if
he
could
have
foreseen
that
his
absence
was
to
be
prolonged
to
no
less
than
four
years
he
had
however
two
great
satisfactions
he
was
represented
at
quebec
by
a
most
steadfast
lieutenant
the
quiet
alert
discreet
and
determined
cramahe
and
he
was
leaving
canada
after
having
given
proof
of
a
disinterestedness
which
was
worthy
of
the
elder
pitt
himself
when
pitt
became
of
england
he
at
once
declined
to
use
the
two
chief
perquisites
of
his
office
the
interest
on
the
government
balance
and
the
half
per
cent
commission
on
foreign
subsidies
though
both
were
regarded
as
a
kind
of
indirect
salary
when
carleton
became
governor
of
canada
he
at
once
issued
a
proclamation
abolishing
all
the
fees
and
perquisites
attached
to
his
position
and
explained
his
action
to
the
home
authorities
in
the
following
words
is
a
certain
appearance
of
dirt
a
sort
of
meanness
in
exacting
fees
on
every
occasion
i
think
it
necessary
for
the
king
service
that
his
representative
should
be
thought
unsullied
murray
who
had
accepted
the
fees
at
first
took
umbrage
but
carleton
soon
put
matters
straight
with
him
the
fact
was
that
fees
and
even
certain
perquisites
were
no
dishonour
to
receive
as
they
nearly
always
formed
a
recognized
part
and
often
the
whole
of
a
perfectly
legal
salary
but
fees
and
perquisites
could
be
abused
and
they
did
lead
to
misunderstandings
even
when
they
were
not
abused
while
fixed
salaries
were
free
from
both
objections
so
carleton
surrounded
by
shamelessly
rapacious
magistrates
and
the
whole
vile
gang
as
well
as
by
french
canadians
who
had
suffered
from
the
robberies
of
bigot
and
his
like
decided
to
sacrifice
everything
but
his
indispensable
fixed
salary
in
order
that
even
the
most
malicious
critics
could
not
bring
any
accusation
however
false
against
the
man
who
represented
britain
and
her
king
an
interesting
personal
interlude
which
was
not
without
considerable
effect
on
canadian
history
took
place
in
the
middle
of
carleton
four
years
stay
in
england
he
was
and
still
a
bachelor
tradition
whispers
that
these
long
years
of
single
life
were
the
result
of
a
disappointing
love
affair
with
jane
carleton
a
pretty
cousin
when
both
he
and
she
were
young
however
that
may
be
he
now
proposed
to
lady
anne
howard
whose
father
the
earl
of
effingham
was
one
of
his
greatest
friends
but
he
was
doomed
to
a
second
though
doubtless
very
minor
disappointment
lady
anne
who
probably
looked
on
carleton
as
a
sort
of
amiable
uncle
had
fallen
in
love
with
his
nephew
whom
she
presently
married
and
with
whom
she
afterwards
went
out
to
canada
where
her
husband
served
under
the
rejected
uncle
himself
what
added
spice
to
this
peculiar
situation
was
the
fact
that
carleton
actually
married
the
younger
sister
of
the
lady
anne
when
lady
anne
rejoined
her
sister
and
their
bosom
friend
miss
seymour
after
the
disconcerting
interview
with
carleton
she
explained
her
tears
by
saying
they
were
due
to
her
having
been
to
refuse
the
best
man
on
earth
more
fool
you
answered
the
younger
sister
lady
maria
then
just
eighteen
only
wish
he
had
given
me
the
chance
there
for
the
time
the
matter
ended
carleton
went
back
to
his
official
duties
in
furtherance
of
the
quebec
act
his
nephew
and
the
elder
sister
made
mutual
love
lady
maria
held
her
tongue
but
miss
seymour
had
not
forgotten
and
one
day
she
mustered
up
courage
to
tell
carleton
the
story
of
more
fool
you
this
decided
him
to
act
at
once
he
proposed
was
accepted
and
lived
happily
married
for
the
rest
of
his
long
life
lady
maria
was
small
and
which
heightened
her
girlish
appearance
when
like
madame
de
champlain
she
came
out
to
canada
with
a
husband
more
than
old
enough
to
be
her
father
but
she
had
been
brought
up
at
versailles
she
knew
all
the
aristocratic
graces
of
the
old
regime
and
her
slight
upright
figure
erect
as
any
soldier
to
her
dying
day
almost
matched
her
husband
stalwart
form
in
dignity
of
carriage
the
quebec
act
of
the
magna
charta
of
the
race
finally
passed
the
house
of
lords
on
the
of
june
the
general
idea
of
the
act
was
to
reverse
the
unsuccessful
policy
of
ultimate
assimilation
with
the
other
american
colonies
by
making
canada
a
distinctly
province
the
maritime
provinces
with
a
population
of
some
thirty
thousand
were
to
be
as
english
as
they
chose
but
a
greatly
enlarged
quebec
with
a
population
of
ninety
thousand
and
stretching
far
into
the
unsettled
west
was
to
remain
equally
though
the
rights
of
what
it
was
then
thought
would
be
a
perpetual
minority
were
to
be
safeguarded
in
every
reasonable
way
the
whole
country
between
the
american
colonies
and
the
domains
of
the
hudson
bay
company
was
included
in
this
new
quebec
which
comprised
the
southern
half
of
what
is
now
the
newfoundland
labrador
practically
the
whole
of
the
modern
provinces
of
quebec
and
ontario
and
all
the
western
lands
between
the
ohio
and
the
great
lakes
as
far
as
the
mississippi
that
is
the
modern
american
states
of
ohio
indiana
illinois
michigan
and
wisconsin
the
act
gave
canada
the
english
criminal
code
it
recognized
most
of
the
french
civil
law
including
the
seigneurial
tenure
of
land
roman
catholics
were
given
free
exercise
of
their
religion
to
the
supremacy
as
defined
an
act
made
in
the
first
year
of
queen
elizabeth
which
act
with
a
magnificently
prophetic
outlook
on
the
future
british
empire
was
to
apply
to
the
dominions
and
countries
which
then
did
or
thereafter
should
belong
to
the
imperial
crown
the
roman
catholic
clergy
were
authorized
to
collect
accustomed
dues
and
rights
from
members
of
their
own
communion
the
new
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
crown
was
silent
about
differences
of
religion
so
that
roman
catholics
might
take
it
without
question
the
clergy
and
seigneurs
were
thus
restored
to
an
acknowledged
leadership
in
church
and
state
those
who
wanted
a
parliament
were
distinctly
told
that
is
at
present
inexpedient
to
call
an
assembly
and
that
a
council
of
from
seventeen
to
members
all
appointed
by
the
crown
would
attend
to
local
government
and
have
power
to
levy
taxes
for
roads
and
public
buildings
only
lands
held
free
and
common
socage
were
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
laws
of
england
as
was
all
property
which
could
be
freely
willed
away
a
possible
establishment
of
the
church
of
england
was
provided
for
but
never
put
in
operation
in
some
ways
the
act
did
in
other
ways
it
did
not
fulfil
the
objects
of
its
framers
it
was
undoubtedly
a
generous
concession
to
the
leading
french
canadians
it
did
help
to
keep
canada
both
british
and
canadian
and
it
did
open
the
way
for
what
ought
to
have
been
a
crushing
attack
on
the
american
revolutionary
forces
but
it
was
not
and
neither
it
nor
any
other
act
could
possibly
have
been
at
that
late
hour
completely
successful
it
conciliated
the
seigneurs
and
the
parochial
clergy
but
it
did
not
and
it
could
not
also
conciliate
the
lesser
townsfolk
and
the
habitants
for
the
last
fourteen
years
the
habitants
had
been
gradually
drifting
away
from
their
former
habits
of
obedience
and
former
obligations
towards
their
leaders
in
church
and
state
the
leaders
had
lost
their
old
followers
the
followers
had
found
no
new
leaders
of
their
own
naturally
enough
there
was
great
satisfaction
among
the
seigneurs
and
the
clergy
with
a
general
feeling
among
government
supporters
both
in
england
and
canada
that
the
best
solution
of
a
very
refractory
problem
had
been
found
at
last
on
the
other
hand
the
opposition
in
england
nearly
every
one
in
the
american
colonies
and
the
great
majority
of
people
in
newfoundland
the
maritime
provinces
and
canada
itself
were
dead
against
the
act
while
the
habitants
resenting
the
privileges
already
reaffirmed
in
favour
of
the
seigneurs
and
clergy
and
suspicious
of
further
changes
in
the
same
unwelcome
direction
were
neutral
at
the
best
and
hostile
at
the
worst
the
american
colonists
would
have
been
angered
in
any
case
but
when
they
saw
canada
proper
made
as
unlike
a
colony
as
could
be
and
when
they
also
saw
the
gates
of
the
coveted
western
lands
closed
against
them
by
the
same
detested
act
the
last
of
the
intolerable
acts
to
which
they
most
objected
their
fury
knew
no
bounds
they
cursed
the
king
the
pope
and
the
french
canadians
with
as
much
violence
as
any
temporal
or
spiritual
rulers
had
ever
cursed
heretics
and
rebels
the
and
tyrannical
ministry
in
england
was
accused
of
subservience
to
the
idolatrous
and
hypocritical
creed
of
the
french
canadians
to
think
that
people
whose
religion
had
spread
persecution
and
revolt
throughout
the
world
were
to
be
entrenched
along
the
st
lawrence
was
bad
enough
but
to
see
crown
protection
given
to
the
indian
lands
which
the
americans
considered
their
own
western
was
infinitely
worse
was
the
king
of
england
to
steal
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
in
the
same
way
as
the
king
of
france
it
is
easy
to
be
wise
after
the
event
and
hard
to
follow
any
counsel
of
perfection
but
it
must
always
be
a
subject
of
keen
if
unavailing
regret
that
the
french
canadians
were
not
guaranteed
their
own
way
of
life
within
the
limits

immediately
after

capitulation
of
montreal
in
they
would
then
have
entered
the
british
empire
as
a
whole
people
on
terms
which
they
must
all
have
understood
to
be
exceedingly
generous
from
any
conquering
power
and
which
they
would
have
soon
found
out
to
be
far
better
than
anything
they
had
experienced
under
the
government
of
france
in
return
for
such
unexampled
generosity
they
might
have
become
convinced
defenders
of
the
only
flag
in
the
world
under
which
they
could
possibly
live
as
french
canadians
their
relations
to
each
other
to
the
rest
of
a
changing
canada
and
to
the
empire
would
have
followed
the
natural
course
of
political
evolution
with
the
burning
questions
of
language
laws
and
religion
safely
removed
from
general
controversy
in
after
years
the
rights
of
the
minority
could
of
course
have
been
still
better
safeguarded
under
this
system
than
under
the
distracting
series
of
which
took
its
place
there
should
have
been
no
question
of
a
parliament
in
the
immediate
future
then
with
the
peopling
of
ontario
by
the
united
empire
loyalists
and
the
growth
of
the
maritime
provinces
on
the
other
side
quebec
could
have
entered
carleton
proposed
confederation
in
the
nineties
to
her
own
and
every
one
else
best
advantage
on
the
other
hand
the
delay
of
fourteen
years
after
the
capitulation
of
and
the
unwarrantable
extension
of
the
provincial
boundaries
were
cardinal
errors
of
the
most
disastrous
kind
the
delay
filled
with
a
futile
attempt
at
mistaken
americanization
bred
doubts
and
dissensions
not
only
between
the
two
races
but
between
the
different
kinds
of
french
canadians
when
the
hour
of
trial
came
disintegration
had
already
gone
too
far
the
mistake
about
the
boundaries
was
equally
bad
the
western
wilds
ought
to
have
been
administered
by
a
under
the
supervision
of
a
even
leasing
them
for
a
short
term
of
years
to
the
hudson
bay
company
would
have
been
better
than
annexing
them
to
a
preposterous
province
of
quebec
the
american
colonists
would
have
doubtless
objected
to
either
alternative
but
both
could
have
been
defended
on
sound
principles
of
administration
while
the
sudden
invasion
of
a
new
and
inflated
quebec
into
the
colonial
hinterlands
was
little
less
than
a
declaration
of
war
the
whole
problem
bristled
with
enormous
difficulties
and
the
circumstances
under
which
it
had
to
be
faced
made
an
ideal
solution
impossible
but
an
earlier
quebec
act
without
its
outrageous
boundary
clause
would
have
been
well
worth
the
risk
of
passing
for
the
delay
led
many
french
canadians
to
suppose
however
falsely
that
the
empire
need
might
always
be
their
opportunity
and
this
idea
however
repugnant
to
their
best
minds
and
better
feelings
has
persisted
among
their
extreme
particularists
until
the
present
day
chapter
iv
invasion
carleton
first
eight
years
as
governor
of
canada
were
almost
entirely
occupied
with
civil
administration
the
next
four
were
equally
occupied
with
war
so
much
so
indeed
that
the
quebec
act
could
not
be
put
in
force
on
the
of
may
as
provided
for
in
the
act
itself
but
only
bit
by
bit
much
later
on
there
was
one
short
session
of
the
new
legislative
council
which
opened
on
the
of
august
but
all
men
minds
were
even
then
turned
towards
the
montreal
frontier
whence
the
american
invasion
threatened
to
overspread
the
whole
country
and
make
this
opening
session
the
last
that
might
ever
be
held
most
of
the
members
were
soon
called
away
from
the
to
the
field
no
further
session
could
be
held
either
that
year
or
the
next
and
carleton
was
obliged
to
nominate
the
judges
himself
the
fifteen
years
of
peace
were
over
and
canada
had
once
more
become
an
object
of
contention
between
two
fiercely
hostile
forces
the
war
of
the
american
revolution
was
a
long
and
exceedingly
complicated
struggle
and
its
many
varied
fortunes
naturally
had
a
profound
effect
on
those
of
canada
but
canada
was
directly
engaged
in
no
more
than
the
first
three
campaigns
when
the
americans
invaded
her
in
and
and
when
the
british
used
her
as
the
base
from
which
to
invade
the
new
american
republic
in
these
first
three
campaigns
formed
a
purely
civil
war
within
the
british
empire
on
each
side
stood
three
parties
opponents
were
ranged
against
each
other
in
the
mother
country
in
the
thirteen
colonies
and
in
canada
in
the
mother
country
the
king
and
his
party
government
were
ranged
against
the
opposition
and
all
who
held
radical
or
revolutionary
views
here
the
strife
was
merely
political
but
in
the
thirteen
colonies
the
forces
of
the
crown
were
ranged
against
the
forces
of
the
new
continental
congress
the
small
minority
of
colonists
who
were
afterwards
known
as
the
united
empire
loyalists
sided
with
the
crown
a
majority
sided
with
the
congress
the
rest
kept
as
selfishly
neutral
as
they
could
among
the
civilians
in
canada
many
of
whom
were
now
of
a
much
better
class
than
the
original
the
active
loyalists
comprised
only
the
smaller
half
the
larger
half
sided
with
the
americans
as
was
only
natural
seeing
that
most
of
them
were
immigrants
from
the
thirteen
colonies
but
by
no
means
all
these
sympathizers
were
ready
for
a
fight
among
the
french
canadians
the
loyalists
included
very
few
besides
the
seigneurs
the
clergy
and
a
handful
of
educated
people
in
montreal
three
rivers
and
quebec
the
mass
of
the
habitants
were
more
or
less
neutral
but
many
of
them
were
at
first
while
most
of
them
were
afterwards
events
moved
quickly
in
on
the
of
april
the
heard
round
the
world
was
fired
at
lexington
in
massachusetts
on
the
of
may
the
day
appointed
for
the
inauguration
of
the
quebec
act
the
statue
of
the
king
in
montreal
was
grossly
defaced
and
hung
with
a
cross
a
necklace
of
potatoes
and
a
placard
bearing
the
inscription
the
canadian
pope
and
english
fool
voila
le
pape
du
canada
et
le
sot
large
rewards
were
offered
for
the
detection
of
the
culprits
but
without
avail
excitement
ran
high
and
many
an
argument
ended
with
a
bloody
nose
meanwhile
three
americans
were
plotting
an
attack
along
the
old
line
of
lake
champlain
two
of
them
were
outlaws
from
the
colony
of
new
york
which
was
then
disputing
with
the
neighbouring
colony
of
new
hampshire
the
possession
of
the
lawless
region
in
which
all
three
had
taken
refuge
and
which
afterwards
became

the
gigantic
leader
of
the
wild
green

a
price
on
his
head

his
assistant
was
an
outlaw
of
a
somewhat
humbler
kind
benedict
arnold
the
third
invader
came
from
connecticut
he
was
a
carrying
on
business
with
quebec
and
montreal
as
well
as
the
west
indies
he
was
just
an
excellent
rider
a
dead
shot
a
very
fair
sailor
and
captain
of
a
crack
militia
company
immediately
after
the
affair
at
lexington
he
had
turned
out
his
company
reinforced
by
undergraduates
from
yale
had
seized
the
new
haven
powder
magazine
and
marched
over
to
cambridge
where
the
massachusetts
committeemen
took
such
a
fancy
to
him
that
they
made
him
a
colonel
on
the
spot
with
full
authority
to
raise
men
for
an
immediate
attack
on
ticonderoga
the
opportunity
seemed
too
good
to
be
lost
though
the
continental
congress
was
not
then
in
favour
of
attacking
canada
as
its
members
hoped
to
see
the
canadians
throw
off
the
yoke
of
empire
on
their
own
account
the
british
posts
on
lake
champlain
were
absurdly
undermanned
ticonderoga
contained
two
hundred
cannon
but
only
forty
men
none
of
whom
expected
an
attack
crown
point
had
only
a
sergeant
and
a
dozen
men
to
watch
its
hundred
and
thirteen
pieces
fort
george
at
the
head
of
lake
george
was
no
better
off
and
nothing
more
had
been
done
to
man
the
fortifications
at
st
johns
on
the
richelieu
where
there
was
an
excellent
sloop
as
well
as
many
cannon
in
charge
of
the
usual
sergeant
guard
this
want
of
preparation
was
no
fault
of
carleton
he
had
frequently
reported
home
on
the
need
of
more
men
now
he
had
less
than
a
thousand
regulars
to
defend
the
whole
country
and
not
another
man
was
to
arrive
till
the
spring
of
next
year
when
gage
was
hard
pressed
for
reinforcements
at
boston
in
the
autumn
of
carleton
had
immediately
sent
him
two
excellent
battalions
that
could
ill
be
spared
from
canada
but
when
carleton
himself
made
a
similar
request
in
the
autumn
of
admiral
graves
to
his
lasting
dishonour
refused
to
sail
up
to
quebec
so
late
as
october
the
first
moves
of
the
three
americans
smacked
strongly
of
a
extravaganza
in
which
the
smart
yankees
never
failed
to
score
off
the
dunderheaded
british
the
green
mountain
boys
assembled
on
the
east
side
of
the
lake
spies
walked
in
and
out
of
ticonderoga
exactly
opposite
and
reported
to
ethan
allen
that
the
commandant
and
his
whole
garrison
of
forty
unsuspecting
men
would
make
an
easy
prey
allen
then
sent
eighty
men
down
to
skenesborough
now
whitehall
at
the
southern
end
of
the
lake
to
take
the
tiny
post
there
and
bring
back
boats
for
the
crossing
on
the
of
may
then
arnold
turned
up
with
his
colonel
commission
but
without
the
four
hundred
men
it
authorized
him
to
raise
allen
however
had
made
himself
a
colonel
too
with
warner
as
his
so
there
were
no
less
than
three
colonels
for
two
hundred
and
thirty
men
arnold
claimed
the
command
by
virtue
of
his
massachusetts
commission
but
the
green
mountain
boys
declared
they
would
follow
no
colonels
but
their
own
and
so
arnold
after
being
threatened
with
arrest
was
appointed
something
like
chief
of
the
staff
on
the
understanding
that
he
would
make
himself
generally
useful
with
the
boats
this
appointment
was
made
at
dawn
on
the
of
may
just
as
the
first
eighty
men
were
advancing
to
the
attack
after
crossing
over
under
cover
of
night
the
british
musket
missed
fire
whereupon
he
and
the
guard
were
rushed
while
the
rest
of
the
garrison
were
surprised
in
their
beds
ethan
allen
who
knew
the
fort
thoroughly
hammered
on
the
commandant
door
and
summoned
him
to
surrender
the
name
of
the
great
jehovah
and
the
continental
congress
the
astonished
commandant
seeing
that
resistance
was
impossible
put
on
his
and
paraded
his
disarmed
garrison
as
prisoners
of
war
seth
warner
presently
arrived
with
the
rest
of
men
and
soon
became
the
hero
of
crown
point
which
he
took
with
the
whole
of
its
thirteen
men
and
a
hundred
and
thirteen
cannon
then
arnold
had
his
own
turn
in
command
of
an
expedition
against
the
sergeant
guard
cannon
stores
fort
and
sloop
at
st
johns
on
the
richelieu
all
of
which
he
captured
in
the
same
absurdly
simple
way
when
he
came
sailing
back
the
three
victorious
commanders
paraded
all
their
men
and
fired
off
many
straggling
fusillades
of
joy
in
the
meantime
the
continental
congress
at
philadelphia
with
a
delightful
touch
of
unconscious
humour
was
gravely
debating
the
following
resolution
which
was
passed
on
the
of
june
no
expedition
or
incursion
ought
to
be
undertaken
or
made
by
any
colony
or
body
of
colonists
against
or
into
the
same
congress
however
found
reasons
enough
for
changing
its
mind
before
the
month
of
may
was
out
the
british
forces
in
canada
had
already
begun
to
move
towards
the
threatened
frontier
they
had
occupied
and
strengthened
st
johns
and
the
americans
were
beginning
to
fear
lest
the
command
of
lake
champlain
might
again
fall
into
british
hands
on
the
of
may
the
congress
closed
the
phase
of
individual
raids
and
inaugurated
the
phase
of
regular
invasion
by
commissioning
general
schuyler
to
any
measures
in
canada
that
may
have
a
tendency
to
promote
the
peace
and
security
of
these
colonies
philip
schuyler
was
a
distinguished
member
of
the
family
whose
head
had
formulated
the
enterprize
of
conquering
new
france
in
footnote
see
in
this
series
fighting
so
it
was
quite
in
line
with
the
family
tradition
for
him
to
be
under
orders
to
possession
of
st
johns
montreal
and
any
other
parts
of
the
country
provided
always
adds
the
cautious
congress
that
schuyler
finds
it
practicable
and
that
it
will
not
be
disagreeable
to
the
canadians
a
few
days
later
arnold
was
trying
to
get
a
colonelcy
from
the
convention
of
new
york
whose
members
just
then
happened
to
be
thinking
of
giving
commissions
to
his
rivals
the
leaders
of
the
green
mountain
boys
while
to
make
the
complication
quite
complete
these
boys
themselves
had
every
intention
of
electing
officers
on
their
own
account
in
the
meantime
connecticut
determined
not
to
be
forestalled
by
either
friend
or
foe
ordered
a
thousand
men
to
ticonderoga
and
commissioned
a
general
called
wooster
to
command
them
thus
early
were
sown
the
seeds
of
those
dissensions
between
congress
troops
and
colony
troops
which
nearly
drove
washington
mad
schuyler
reached
ticonderoga
in
and
assumed
his
position
as
congressional
unfortunately
for
the
good
of
the
service
he
had
only
a
few
hundred
men
with
him
so
wooster
who
had
a
thousand
thought
himself
the
bigger
general
of
the
two
the
connecticut
men
followed
wooster
lead
by
jeering
at
schuyler
men
from
new
york
while
the
vermonters
added
to
the
confusion
by
electing
seth
warner
instead
of
ethan
allen
in
a
second
congressional
general
arrived
making
three
generals
and
half
a
dozen
colonels
for
less
than
fifteen
hundred
troops
this
third
general
was
richard
montgomery
an
ardent
rebel
of
who
had
been
a
captain
in
the
british
army
he
had
sold
his
commission
bought
an
estate
on
the
hudson
and
married
a

headed
the
revolutionists
in

as
the
schuylers

dutch
one
of
them
was
very
active
on

side
in

richard
montgomery
was
a
much
better
man
than
his
savage
brother
though
as
the
sequel
proves
he
was
by
no
means
the
perfect
hero
his
american
admirers
would
have
the
world
believe
his
great
value
at
ticonderoga
was
his
professional
knowledge
and
his
ardour
in
the
cause
he
had
espoused
his
presence
the
spirit
of
the
camp
it
sadly
needed
change
a
set
of
pusillanimous
wretches
never
were
collected
is
his
own
description
in
a
despairing
letter
to
his
wife
the
in
fact
was
all
parts
and
no
whole
and
all
the
parts
were
mere
untrained
militia

the
spirit
of

ruled

a

could
not
be
moved
without
consulting

schuyler

far
more
phlegmatic
than

heartily
about

exasperating

of
canada
the
prospect
was
already
black
enough
though
it
grew
blacker
still
as
time
went
on
immediately
on
hearing
the
news
of
ticonderoga
crown
point
and
st
johns
at
the
end
of
may
he
had
sent
every
available
man
from
quebec
to
montreal
whence
colonel
templer
had
already
sent
off
a
hundred
and
forty
men
to
st
johns
while
calling
for
volunteers
to
follow
the
seigneurial
class
came
forward
at
once
but
all
attempts
to
turn
out
the
militia
en
proved
utterly
futile
fourteen
years
of
kindly
british
rule
had
loosened
the
old
french
bonds
of
government
and
the
habitants
were
no
longer
united
as
part
of
one
people
with
the
seigneurs
and
the
clergy
the
rebels
had
been
busy
spreading
insidious
perversions
of
the
belated
quebec
act
poisoning
the
minds
of
the
habitants
against
the
british
government
and
filling
their
imaginations
with
all
sorts
of
terrifying
doubts
the
habitants
were
ignorant
credulous
and
suspicious
to
the
last
degree
the
most
absurd
stories
obtained
ready
credence
and
ran
like
wildfire
through
the
province
seven
thousand
russians
were
said
to
be
coming
up
the
st
lawrence
whether
as
friends
or
foes
mattered
nothing
compared
with
the
awful
fact
that
they
were
all
outlandish
bogeys
carleton
was
said
to
have
a
plan
for
burning
alive
every
habitant
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
montgomery
thousand
were
said
to
be
five
thousand
with
many
more
to
follow
and
later
on
when
arnold
men
came
up
the
kennebec
it
was
satisfactorily
explained
to
most
of
the
habitants
that
it
was
no
good
resisting
riflemen
who
were
themselves
carleton
issued
proclamations
the
seigneurs
waved
their
swords
the
clergy
thundered
from
their
pulpits
but
all
in
vain
two
months
after
the
american
exploits
on
lake
champlain
carleton
gave
a
guinea
to
the
sentry
mounted
in
his
honour
by
the
local
militia
colonel
de
tonnancour
because
this
man
was
the
first
genuine
habitant
he
had
yet
seen
armed
in
the
whole
district
of
three
rivers
what
must
carleton
have
felt
when
the
home
government
authorized
him
to
raise
six
thousand
of
his
majesty
loyal
subjects
for
immediate
service
and
informed
him
that
the
arms
and
equipment
for
the
first
three
thousand
were
already
on
the
way
to
canada
seven
years
earlier
it
might
still
have
been
possible
to
raise
counterparts
of
those
highland
regiments
which
wolfe
had
recommended
and
pitt
had
so
cordially
approved
carleton
himself
had
recommended
this
excellent
scheme
at
the
proper
time
but
though
the
home
government
even
then
agreed
with
him
they
thought
such
a
measure
would
raise
more
parliamentary
and
public
clamour
than
they
could
safely
face
the
chance
once
lost
was
lost
for
ever
carleton
had
done
what
he
could
to
keep
the
enemy
at
arm
length
from
montreal
by
putting
every
available
man
into
chambly
and
st
johns
he
knew
nothing
of
force
till
it
actually
reached
quebec
in
november
quebec
was
thought
secure
for
the
time
being
and
so
was
left
with
a
handful
of
men
under
cramahe
montreal
had
a
few
regulars
and
a
hundred
emigrants
mostly
old
highlanders
who
had
settled
along
the
new
york
frontier
after
the
conquest
for
the
rest
it
had
many
american
and
a
few
british
sympathizers
ready
to
fly
at
each
others
throats
and
a
good
many
neutrals
ready
to
curry
favour
with
the
winners
sorel
was
a
mere
post
without
any
effective
garrison
chambly
was
held
by
only
eighty
men
under
major
stopford
but
its
strong
stone
fort
was
well
armed
and
quite
proof
against
anything
except
siege
artillery
while
its
little
garrison
consisted
of
good
regulars
who
were
well
provisioned
for
a
siege
the
mass
of
carleton
little
force
was
at
st
johns
under
major
preston
who
had
men
of
the
and
royal
fusiliers
and
cameronians
gunners
and
volunteers
mostly
gentlemen
preston
was
an
excellent
officer
and
his
seven
hundred
men
were
able
to
give
a
very
good
account
of
themselves
as
soldiers
but
the
fort
was
not
nearly
so
strong
as
the
one
at
chambly
it
had
no
natural
advantages
of
position
and
it
was
short
of
both
stores
and
provisions
the
three
successive
steps
for
montgomery
to
take
were
st
johns
chambly
and
montreal
but
the
natural
order
of
events
was
completely
upset
by
that
headstrong
yankee
ethan
allen
who
would
have
his
private
war
at
montreal
and
by
that
contemptible
british
officer
major
stopford
who
would
not
defend
chambly
montgomery
laid
siege
to
st
johns
on
the
of
september
but
made
no
substantial
progress
for
more
than
a
month
he
probably
had
no
use
for
allen
at
anything
like
a
regular
siege
so
allen
and
a
major
brown
went
on
to
politicks
and
concert
a
rising
with
men
like
livingston
and
walker
livingston
as
we
have
seen
already
belonged
to
a
leading
new
york
family
which
was
very
active
in
the
rebel
cause
and
livingston
walker
allen
and
brown
would
have
made
a
dangerous
combination
if
they
could
only
have
worked
together
but
they
could
not
livingston
hurried
off
to
join
montgomery
with
four
hundred
who
served
their
cause
fairly
well
till
the
invasion
was
over
walker
had
no
military
qualities
whatever
so
allen
and
brown
were
left
to
their
own
disunited
devices
montreal
seemed
an
easy
prey
it
had
plenty
of
rebel
sympathizers
nearly
all
the
surrounding
habitants
were
either
neutrals
or
inclined
to
side
with
the
americans
though
not
as
fighting
men
carleton
order
to
bring
in
all
the
ladders
so
as
to
prevent
an
escalade
of
the
walls
had
met
with
general
opposition
and
evasion
nothing
seemed
wanting
but
a
good
working
plan
brown
or
possibly
allen
himself
then
hit
upon
the
idea
of
treating
montreal
very
much
as
allen
had
treated
ticonderoga
in
any
case
allen
jumped
at
it
he
jumped
so
far
indeed
that
he
forestalled
brown
who
failed
to
appear
at
the
critical
moment
thus
on
the
of
september
allen
found
himself
alone
at
long
point
with
a
hundred
and
twenty
men
in
face
of
three
times
as
many
under
the
redoubtable
major
carden
a
skilled
veteran
who
had
won
wolfe
admiration
years
before
force
included
thirty
regulars
two
hundred
and
forty
militiamen
and
some
indians
probably
not
over
a
hundred
strong
the
militia
were
mostly
of
the
seigneurial
class
with
a
following
of
habitants
and
townsmen
of
both
french
and
british
blood
carden
broke
allen
flanks
rounded
up
his
centre
and
won
the
little
action
easily
though
at
the
expense
of
his
own
most
useful
life
allen
was
very
indignant
at
being
handcuffed
and
marched
off
like
a
common
prisoner
after
having
made
himself
a
colonel
twice
over
but
carleton
had
no
respect
for
officers
and
had
no
soldiers
to
spare
for
guarding
dangerous
rebels
so
he
shipped
allen
off
to
england
where
that
eccentric
warrior
was
confined
in
pendennis
castle
near
falmouth
in
cornwall
this
affair
small
as
it
was
revived
british
hopes
in
montreal
and
induced
a
few
more
militiamen
and
indians
to
come
forward
but
within
a
month
more
was
lost
at
chambly
than
had
been
gained
at
montreal
on
the
of
october
a
small
american
detachment
attacked
chambly
with
two
little
and
induced
it
to
surrender
on
the
if
ever
an
officer
deserved
to
be
shot
it
was
major
stopford
who
tamely
surrendered
his
and
fort
to
an
insignificant
force
after
a
flimsy
resistance
of
only
hours
without
even
taking
the
trouble
to
throw
his
stores
into
the
river
that
flowed
beside
his
strong
stone
walls
the
news
of
this
disgraceful
surrender
diligently
spread
by
rebel
sympathizers
frightened
the
indians
away
from
st
johns
thus
depriving
major
preston
the
commandant
of
his
best
couriers
at
the
very
worst
time
but
the
evil
did
not
stop
there
for
nearly
all
the
few
militiamen
whom
the
more
distant
seigneurs
had
been
able
to
get
under
arms
deserted
with
many
threats
against
any
one
who
should
try
to
turn
them
out
again
chambly
is
only
a
short
day
march
from
montreal
to
the
west
and
st
johns
to
the
south
so
its
capture
meant
that
st
johns
was
entirely
cut
off
from
the
richelieu
to
the
north
and
dangerously
exposed
to
being
cut
off
from
montreal
as
well
its
ample
stores
and
munitions
of
war
were
a
priceless
boon
to
montgomery
who
now
redoubled
his
efforts
to
take
st
johns
but
preston
held
out
bravely
for
the
remainder
of
the
month
while
carleton
did
his
best
to
help
him
a
fortnight
earlier
carleton
had
arrested
that
firebrand
walker
who
had
previously
refused
to
leave
the
country
though
carleton
had
given
him
the
chance
of
doing
so
mrs
walker
as
much
a
rebel
as
her
husband
interviewed
carleton
and
noted
in
her
diary
that
he
many
severe
things
in
very
soft
polite
termes
carleton
was
firm
walker
actions
words
and
correspondence
all
proved
him
a
dangerous
rebel
whom
no
governor
could
possibly
leave
at
large
without
breaking
his
oath
of
office
walker
who
had
himself
caused
so
many
outrageous
arrests
now
not
only
resisted
the
legal
arrest
of
his
own
person
but
fired
on
the
little
party
of
soldiers
who
had
been
sent
to
bring
him
into
montreal
the
soldiers
then
began
to
burn
him
out
whereupon
he
carried
his
wife
to
a
window
from
which
the
soldiers
rescued
her
he
then
surrendered
and
was
brought
into
montreal
where
the
sight
of
him
as
a
prisoner
made
a
considerable
impression
on
the
waverers
a
few
hundred
neighbouring
militiamen
were
scraped
together
every
one
of
the
handful
of
regulars
who
could
be
spared
was
turned
out
and
carleton
set
off
to
the
relief
of
st
johns
but
seth
warner
green
mountain
boys
reinforced
by
many
more
sharpshooters
prevented
carleton
from
landing
at
longueuil
opposite
montreal
the
remaining
indians
began
to
slink
away
the
militiamen
deserted
fast
or
forty
of
a
night
there
were
not
two
hundred
regulars
available
for
a
march
across
country
and
on
the
carleton
was
forced
to
give
up
in
despair
within
the
week
st
johns
surrendered
with
men
who
were
taken
south
as
prisoners
of
war
preston
had
been
completely
cut
off
and
threatened
with
starvation
as
well
so
when
he
destroyed
everything
likely
to
be
needed
by
the
enemy
he
had
done
all
that
could
be
expected
of
a
brave
and
capable
commander
it
was
the
of
november
when
st
johns
surrendered
ten
days
later
montgomery
occupied
montreal
and
arnold
landed
at
wolfe
cove
just
above
quebec
the
race
for
the
possession
of
quebec
had
been
a
very
close
one
the
race
for
the
capture
of
carleton
was
to
be
closer
still
and
on
the
fate
of
either
depended
the
immediate
and
perhaps
the
ultimate
fate
of
canada
the
race
for
quebec
had
been
none
the
less
desperate
because
the
british
had
not
known
of
the
danger
from
the
south
till
after
arnold
had
suddenly
emerged
from
the
wilds
of
maine
and
was
well
on
his
way
to
the
mouth
of
the
chaudiere
which
falls
into
the
st
lawrence
seven
miles
above
the
city
arnold
subsequent
change
of
sides
earned
him
the
execration
of
the
americans
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatever
that
if
he
had
got
through
in
time
to
capture
quebec
he
would
have
become
a
national
hero
of
the
united
states
he
had
the
advantage
of
leading
picked
men
though
nearly
three
hundred
did
turn
back
but
even
with
picked
men
his
feat
was
one
of
surpassing
excellence
his
force
went
in
eleven
hundred
strong
it
came
out
reduced
by
desertion
as
well
as
by
almost
incredible
hardships
with
barely
seven
hundred
it
began
its
toilsome
ascent
of
the
kennebec
towards
the
end
of
september
carrying
six
weeks
supplies
in
the
bad
hastily
built
boats
or
on
the
men
backs
daniel
morgan
and
his
virginian
riflemen
led
the
way
aaron
burr
was
present
as
a
young
volunteer
the
portages
were
many
and
trying
the
settlements
were
few
at
first
and
then
wanting
altogether
early
in
october
the
drenched
portagers
were
already
sleeping
in
their
frozen
clothes
the
boats
began
to
break
up
quantities
of
provisions
were
lost
soon
there
was
scarcely
anything
left
but
flour
and
salt
pork
it
took
nearly
a
fortnight
to
get
past
the
great
carrying
place
in
sight
of
mount
bigelow
rock
bog
and
freezing
slime
told
on
the
men
some
of
whom
began
to
fall
sick
then
came
the
chain
of
ponds
leading
into
dead
river
then
the
last
climb
up
to
the
beyond
which
lay
the
headwaters
of
the
chaudiere
which
takes
its
rise
in
lake
megantic
there
were
sixty
miles
to
go
beyond
the
lake
and
a
badly
broken
sixty
miles
they
were
before
the
first
settlement
of
french
canadians
could
be
reached
there
was
no
trail
provisions
were
almost
at
an
end
sickness
increased
the
sick
began
to
die
what
was
it
all
for
a
chance
to
get
killed
the
end
of
the
march
was
quebec
impregnable
on
the
of
october
arnold
with
fifteen
other
men
began
race
against
time
a
race
against
starvation
by
pushing
on
ahead
in
a
desperate
effort
to
find
food
within
a
week
he
had
reached
the
first
settlement
after
losing
three
of
his
five
boats
with
everything
in
them
three
days
later
and
not
one
day
too
soon
the
french
canadians
met
his
seven
hundred
famishing
men
with
a
drove
of
cattle
and
plenty
of
provisions
the
rest
of
the
way
was
toilsome
enough
but
it
seemed
easy
by
comparison
the
habitants
were
friendly
but
very
shy
about
enlisting
in
spite
of
invitation
to
yourselves
under
the
standard
of
general
liberty
the
indians
were
more
responsive
and
nearly
fifty
joined
on
their
own
terms
by
the
of
november
arnold
was
marching
down
the
south
shore
of
the
st
lawrence
from
the
chaudiere
to
point
levis
in
full
view
of
quebec
he
had
just
received
a
dispatch
ten
days
old
from
montgomery
by
which
he
learned
that
st
johns
was
expected
to
fall
immediately
and
that
schuyler
was
no
longer
with
the
army
at
the
front
but
he
could
not
tell
when
the
junction
of
forces
would
be
made
and
he
saw
at
once
that
quebec
was
on
the
alert
because
every
boat
had
been
either
destroyed
or
taken
over
to
the
other
side
the
spring
and
summer
had
been
anxious
times
enough
in
quebec
but
the
autumn
was
a
great
deal
worse
bad
news
kept
coming
down
from
montreal
the
disaffected
got
more
and
more
restless
and
began
act
as
though
no
opposition
might
be
shown
the
rebel
forces
and
in
october
it
did
seem
as
if
nothing
could
be
done
to
stop
the
invaders
there
were
only
a
few
hundred
militiamen
that
could
be
depended
on
the
regulars
under
colonel
maclean
had
gone
up
to
help
carleton
on
the
montreal
frontier
the
fortifications
were
in
no
state
to
stand
a
siege
but
cramahe
was
full
of
steadfast
energy
he
had
mustered
the
militia
on
september
the
very
day
arnold
was
leaving
cambridge
in
massachusetts
for
his
daring
march
against
quebec
these
men
had
answered
the
call
far
better
in
the
city
of
quebec
than
anywhere
else
there
was
also
a
larger
proportion
of
loyalists
here
than
in
montreal
but
no
transports
brought
troops
up
the
st
lawrence
from
boston
or
the
mother
country
and
no
vessel
brought
carleton
down
the
loyalists
were
however
encouraged
by
the
presence
of
two
small
one
of
which
the
had
been
the
for
wolfe
boat
the
night
before
the
battle
of
the
plains
some
minor
reinforcements
also
kept
arriving
veterans
from
the
border
settlements
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
from
newfoundland
on
the
of
november
the
day
st
johns
surrendered
to
montgomery
an
intercepted
dispatch
had
warned
cramahe
of
approach
and
led
him
to
seize
all
the
boats
on
the
south
shore
opposite
quebec
this
was
by
no
means
his
first
precaution
he
had
sent
some
men
forty
miles
up
the

as
soon
as
the
news
of
the
raids
on
lake
champlain
and
st
johns
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
may
thus
though
neither
of
them
had
anticipated
such
a
bolt
from
the
blue
both
carleton
and
cramahe
had
taken
all
the
reasonable
means
within
their
most
restricted
power
to
provide
against
unforeseen
contingencies
arnold
chance
of
surprising
quebec
had
been
lost
ten
days
before
he
was
able
to
cross
the
st
lawrence
and
when
the
habitants
on
the
south
shore
were
helping
his
men
to
make
the
british
garrison
on
the
north
had
already
become
too
strong
for
him
but
he
was
indefatigable
in
collecting
boats
and
canoes
at
the
mouth
of
the
chaudiere
and
at
other
points
higher
up
than
cramahe
men
had
reached
when
on
their
mission
of
destruction
or
removal
and
he
was
as
capable
as
ever
when
on
the
night
of
the
he
led
his
little
flotilla
through
the
gap
between
the
two
british
the
and
the
the
next
day
he
marched
across
the
plains
of
abraham
and
saluted
quebec
with
three
cheers
but
meanwhile
colonel
maclean
who
had
set
out
to
help
carleton
at
montreal
and
turned
back
on
hearing
the
news
of
st
johns
had
slipped
into
quebec
on
the
so
arnold
found
himself
with
less
than
seven
hundred
effectives
against
the
eleven
hundred
british
who
were
now
behind
the
walls
after
vainly
summoning
the
city
to
surrender
he
retired
to
more
than
twenty
miles
up
the
north
shore
of
the
st
lawrence
there
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
victorious
montgomery
meanwhile
montgomery
was
racing
for
carleton
and
carleton
was
racing
for
quebec
montgomery
had
hurried
on
to
sorel
at
the
mouth
of
the
richelieu
miles
below
montreal
to
mount
guns
that
would
command
the
narrow
channel
through
which
the
fugitive
governor
would
have
to
pass
on
his
way
to
quebec
they
had
ample
time
to
set
the
trap
for
an
incessant
blew
up
the
st
lawrence
day
after
day
and
held
carleton
fast
in
montreal
while
only
a
league
away
main
body
was
preparing
to
cross
over
escape
by
land
was
impossible
as
the
americans
held
berthier
on
the
north
shore
and
had
won
over
the
habitants
all
the
way
down
from
montreal
on
both
sides
of
the
river
at
last
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
wind
shifted
immediately
a
single
was
fired
a
bugle
sounded
the
in
and
whole
military
establishment
of
montreal
formed
up
in
the
barrack
square
one
hundred
and
thirty
officers
and
men
all
told
carleton
to
the
soul
as
one
of
his
officers
wrote
home
came
on
parade
unshaken
and
serene
the
little
column
then
marched
down
to
the
boats
through
shuttered
streets
of
timid
neutrals
and
scowling
rebels
the
few
loyalists
who
came
to
say
to
carleton
at
the
wharf
might
well
have
thought
it
was
the
last
handshake
they
would
ever
get
from
a
british
and
as
they
saw
him
step
aboard
in
the
dreary
dusk
of
that
november
afternoon
and
if
he
and
they
had
known
the
worst
they
might
well
have
thought
their
fate
was
sealed
for
neither
of
them
then
knew
that
both
sides
of
the
st
lawrence
were
occupied
in
force
at
two
different
places
on
the
perilous
way
to
quebec
the
little
flotilla
of
eleven
vessels
got
safely
down
to
within
a
few
miles
of
sorel
when
one
grounded
and
delayed
the
rest
till
the
wind
failed
altogether
at
noon
on
the
the
next
three
days
it
blew
upstream
without
a
break
no
progress
could
be
made
as
there
was
no
room
to
tack
in
the
narrow
passages
opposite
sorel
on
the
third
day
an
american
floating
battery
suddenly
appeared
firing
hard
behind
it
came
a
boat
with
a
flag
of
truce
and
the
following
summons
from
colonel
easton
who
commanded
montgomery
at
sorel
sir
by
this
you
will
learn
that
general
montgomery
is
in
possession
of
the
fortress
montreal
you
are
very
sensible
that
i
am
in
possession
at
this
place
and
that
from
the
strength
of
the
united
colonies
on
both
sides
your
own
situation
is
rendered
very
disagreeable
i
am
therefore
induced
to
make
you
the
following
proposal
viz
that
if
you
will
resign
your
fleet
to
me
immediately
without
destroying
the
effects
on
board
you
and
your
men
shall
be
used
with
due
civility
together
with
women
children
on
board
to
this
i
shall
expect
your
direct
and
immediate
answer
should
you
neglect
you
will
cherefully
take
the
consequences
which
will
follow
carleton
was
surprised
and
well
he
might
be
he
had
not
supposed
that
montgomery
men
were
in
any
such
commanding
position
but
like
cramahe
at
quebec
he
refused
to
answer
whereupon
easton
batteries
opened
both
from
the
south
shore
and
from
isle
st
ignace
heaviest
gun
was
a
while
easton
had
four
one
of
them
mounted
on
a
rowing
battery
that
soon
forced
the
british
to
retreat
the
skipper
of
the
schooner
containing
the
powder
magazine
wanted
to
surrender
on
the
spot
especially
when
he
heard
that
the
americans
were
getting
some
hot
shot
ready
for
him
but
carleton
retreated
upstream
twelve
miles
above
sorel
to
lavaltrie
just
above
berthier
on
the
north
shore
where
on
attempting
to
land
he
was
driven
back
by
some
americans
and
habitants
next
morning
the
a
fateful
day
for
canada
the
same
major
brown
who
had
failed
ethan
allen
at
montreal
came
up
with
a
flag
of
truce
to
propose
that
carleton
should
send
an
officer
to
see
for
himself
how
well
all
chance
of
escape
had
now
been
cut
off
the
offer
was
accepted
and
brown
explained
the
situation
from
the
rebel
point
of
view
is
my
small
battery
and
even
if
you
should
chance
to
escape
i
have
a
grand
battery
at
the
mouth
of
the
sorel
richelieu
which
will
infallibly
sink
all
of
your
vessels
wait
a
little
till
you
see
the
that
are
now
within
there
was
a
good
deal
of
yankee
bluff
in
this
warning
especially
as
the
could
not
be
mounted
in
time
but
the
british
officer
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
that
the
way
was
completely
blocked
and
so
the
americans
felt
sure
that
carleton
would
surrender
the
following
day
carleton
however
was
not
the
man
to
give
in
till
the
very
last
and
one
desperate
chance
still
remained
his
flotilla
was
doomed
but
he
might
still
get
through
alone
without
it
one
of
the
skippers
better
known
as
tourte
or
pigeon
than
by
his
own
name
of
bouchette
because
of
his
wonderfully
quick
trips
was
persuaded
to
make
the
dash
for
freedom
so
carleton
having
ordered
prescott
his
not
to
surrender
the
flotilla
before
the
last
possible
moment
arranged
for
his
own
escape
in
a
whaleboat
it
was
with
infinite
precaution
that
he
made
his
preparations
as
the
enemy
though
confident
of
taking
him
were
still
on
the
alert
to
prevent
such
a
prize
from
slipping
through
their
fingers
he
dressed
like
a
habitant
from
head
to
foot
putting
on
a
tasselled
and
an
du
grey
homespun
suit
of
clothes
with
a
red
sash
and
like
indian
moccasins
then
the
whaleboat
was
quietly
brought
alongside
the
crew
got
in
and
plied
their
muffled
oars
noiselessly
down
to
the
narrow
passage
between
isle
st
ignace
and
the
isle
du
pas
where
they
shipped
the
oars
and
leaned
over
the
side
to
paddle
past
the
nearest
battery
with
the
palms
of
their
hands
it
was
a
moment
of
breathless
excitement
for
the
hope
of
canada
was
in
their
keeping
and
no
turning
back
was
possible
but
the
american
sentries
saw
no
furtive
french
canadians
gliding
through
that
dark
november
night
and
heard
no
suspicious
noises
above
the
regular
ripple
of
the
eddying
island
current
one
tense
and
all
was
over
the
oars
were
run
out
again
the
men
gave
way
with
a
will
and
three
rivers
was
safely
reached
in
the
morning
here
carleton
met
captain
napier
who
took
him
aboard
the
armed
ship
in
which
he
continued
his
journey
to
quebec
he
was
practically
safe
aboard
the
for
arnold
had
neither
an
army
strong
enough
to
take
quebec
nor
any
craft
big
enough
to
fight
a
ship
but
the
flotilla
above
sorel
was
doomed
after
throwing
all
its
powder
into
the
st
lawrence
it
surrendered
on
the
the
very
day
carleton
reached
quebec
the
astonished
americans
were
furious
when
they
found
that
carleton
had
slipped
through
their
fingers
after
all
they
got
prescott
whom
they
hated
and
they
released
walker
whom
carleton
was
taking
as
a
prisoner
to
quebec
but
no
friends
and
foes
like
walker
and
prescott
could
make
up
for
the
loss
of
carleton
who
was
the
heart
as
well
as
the
head
of
canada
at
bay
the
exultation
of
the
british
more
than
matched
the
disappointment
of
the
americans
thomas
ainslie
collector
of
customs
and
captain
of
militia
at
quebec
only
expressed
the
feelings
of
all
his
when
he
made
the
following
entry
in
the
extremely
accurate
diary
he
kept
throughout
those
troublous
times
the
a
happy
day
for
quebec
to
the
unspeakable
joy
of
the
friends
of
the
government
and
to
the
utter
dismay
of
the
abettors
of
sedition
and
rebellion
general
carleton
arrived
in
the
arm
ship
accompanied
by
an
arm
schooner
we
saw
our
salvation
in
his
presence
chapter
v
beleaguerment
when
carleton
finally
turned
at
bay
within
the
walls
of
quebec
the
british
flag
waved
over
less
than
a
single
one
out
of
the
more
than
a
million
square
miles
that
had
so
recently
been
included
within
the
boundaries
of
canada
the
landward
walls
cut
off
the
last
of
the
tilted
promontory
which
rises
three
hundred
feet
above
the
st
lawrence
but
only
one
hundred
above
the
valley
of
the
st
charles
this
promontory
is
just
a
thousand
yards
wide
where
the
landward
walls
run
across
it
and
not
much
wider
across
the
heights
and
plains
of
abraham
which
then
covered
the
first
two
miles
beyond
the
whole
position
makes
one
of
nature
strongholds
when
the
enemy
can
be
kept
at
arm
length
but
carleton
had
no
men
to
spare
for
more
than
the
actual
walls
and
the
narrow
little
strip
of
the
lower
town
between
the
base
of
the
cliff
and
the
st
lawrence
so
the
enemy
closed
in
along
the
heights
and
among
the
suburbs
besides
occupying
any
point
of
vantage
they
chose
across
the
st
lawrence
or
st
charles
the
walls
were
by
no
means
fit
to
stand
a
siege
a
fact
which
carleton
had
frequently
reported
but
as
the
americans
had
neither
the
men
nor
the
material
for
a
regular
siege
they
were
obliged
to
confine
themselves
to
a
mere
beleaguerment
with
the
chance
of
taking
quebec
by
assault
one
of
carleton
first
acts
was
to
proclaim
that
every
man
refusing
to
bear
arms
was
to
leave
the
town
within
four
days
but
though
this
had
the
desired
effect
of
clearing
out
nearly
all
the
dangerous
rebels
the
americans
still
believed
they
had
enough
sympathizers
inside
to
turn
the
scale
of
victory
if
they
could
only
manage
to
take
the
lower
town
with
all
its
commercial
property
and
shipping
or
gain
a
footing
anywhere
within
the
walls
there
were
five
thousand
souls
left
in
quebec
which
was
well
provisioned
for
the
winter
the
women
children
and
men
unfit
to
bear
arms
numbered
three
thousand
the
amounted
to
a
hundred
and
eighty
as
there
was
a
growing
suspicion
about
many
of
these
last
carleton
paraded
them
for
medical
examination
at
the
beginning
of
march
when
a
good
deal
more
than
half
were
found
quite
fit
for
duty
these
men
had
been
malingering
all
winter
in
order
to
skulk
out
of
danger
so
he
treated
them
with
extreme
leniency
in
only
putting
them
on
duty
as
a
of
invalids
but
the
slur
stuck
fast
the
only
other
exceptions
to
the
general
efficiency
were
a
very
few
instances
of
cowardice
and
many
more
of
slackness
the
militia
have
repeated
entries
about
men
who
turned
up
late
for
even
important
duties
as
well
as
about
others
whose
authorized
substitutes
were
no
better
than
themselves
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
as
a
whole
the
garrison
did
exceedingly
good
service
and
that
all
the
malingerers
and
serious
delinquents
together
did
not
amount
to
more
than
a
tenth
of
its
total
which
is
a
small
proportion
for
such
a
mixed
body
the
effective
strength
at
the
beginning
of
the
siege
was
eighteen
hundred
of
all
ranks
only
one
hundred
of
these
belonged
to
the
regular
british
garrison
in
canada
a
few
men
of
the
royal
artillery
and
seventy
men
of
the
royal
fusiliers
a
regiment
which
was
to
be
commanded
in
quebec
sixteen
years
later
by
queen
victoria
father
the
duke
of
kent
the
fusiliers
and
two
hundred
and
thirty
emigrants
were
formed
into
a
little
battalion
under
colonel
maclean
a
officer
and
carleton
man
in
action
majesty
royal
highland
regiment
of
emigrants
which
subsequently
became
the
foot
now
known
as
the
york
and
lancaster
was
hastily
raised
in
from
the
highland
veterans
who
had
settled
in
the
american
colonies
after
the
peace
of
maclean
two
hundred
and
thirty
were
the
first
men
he
could
get
together
in
time
to
reach
quebec
the
only
other
professional
fighters
were
four
hundred
and
marines
of
and
who
were
formed
into
a
naval
battalion
under
their
own
officers
captains
hamilton
and
mckenzie
hamilton
being
made
a
and
mckenzie
a
major
while
doing
duty
ashore
fifty
masters
and
mates
of
trading
vessels
were
enrolled
in
the
same
battalion
the
whole
of
the
shipping
was
laid
up
for
the
winter
in
the
cul
de
sac
which
alone
made
the
lower
town
a
prize
worth
taking
the
mustered
three
hundred
and
thirty
the
five
hundred
and
these
two
corps
included
practically
all
the
official
and
business
classes
in
quebec
and
formed
nearly
half
the
total
combatants
some
of
them
took
no
pay
and
were
not
bound
to
service
beyond
the
neighbourhood
of
quebec
thus
being
very
much
like
the
home
guards
raised
all
over
canada
and
the
rest
of
the
empire
during
the
great
world
war
of
all
the
militia
wore
dark
green
coats
with
buff
waistcoats
and
breeches
the
total
of
eighteen
hundred
was
completed
by
a
hundred
and
twenty
that
is
men
who
would
now
belong
to
the
engineers
ordnance
and
army
service
corps
as
the
composition
of
this
garrison
has
been
so
often
misrepresented
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
distinctly
that
the
past
or
present
regulars
of
all
kinds
soldiers
and
sailors
together
numbered
eight
hundred
and
the
militia
and
other
a
thousand
the
french
canadians
very
few
of
whom
were
or
had
been
regulars
formed
less
than
a
third
of
the
whole
montgomery
and
arnold
had
about
the
same
total
number
of
men
sometimes
there
were
more
sometimes
less
but
what
made
the
real
difference
and
what
really
turned
the
scale
was
that
the
americans
had
hardly
any
regulars
and
that
their
effectives
rarely
averaged
of
their
total
strength
the
balance
was
also
against
them
in
the
matter
of
armament
for
though
virginians
had
many
more
rifles
than
were
to
be
found
among
the
british
the
americans
in
general
were
not
so
well
off
for
bayonets
and
not
so
well
able
to
use
those
they
had
while
the
artillery
odds
were
still
more
against
them
carleton
artillery
was
not
of
the
best
but
it
was
better
than
that
of
the
americans
he
decidedly
overmatched
them
in
the
combined
strength
of
all
kinds
of
ordnance
cannons
carronades
howitzers
mortars
and
swivels
cannons
and
howitzers
fired
shot
and
shell
at
any
range
up
to
the
limit
then
reached
between
two
and
three
miles
carronades
were
on
the
principle
of
a
gigantic
shotgun
firing
masses
of
bullets
with
great
effect
at
very
short
ranges
less
than
that
of
a
long
then
reckoned
at
two
hundred
yards
the
biggest
mortars
threw
shells
to
a
great
distance
but
their
main
use
was
for
fire
such
as
that
from

of
quebec
swivels
were
the
smallest
kind
of
ordnance
firing
or
balls
at
short
or
medium
ranges
they
were
used
at
convenient
points
to
stop
rushes
much
like
modern
thanks
chiefly
to
cramahe
the
defences
were
not
nearly
so
as
arnold
at
first
had
thought
them
the
walls
however
useless
against
the
best
siege
artillery
were
formidable
enough
against
irregular
troops
and
makeshift
batteries
while
the
warehouses
and
shipping
in
the
lower
town
were
protected
by
two
stockades
one
straight
under
cape
diamond
the
other
at
the
corner
where
the
lower
town
turns
into
the
valley
of
the
st
charles
the
first
was
called
the
the
second
the
the
shipping
was
open
to
bombardment
from
the
levis
shore
but
the
americans
had
no
guns
to
spare
for
this
till
april
montgomery
advance
was
greatly
aided
by
the
little
flotilla
which
easton
had
captured
at
sorel
montgomery
met
arnold
at
twenty
miles
above
quebec
on
the
of
december
and
supplied
his
little
force
with
the
british
uniforms
taken
at
st
johns
and
chambly
he
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
magnificent
physique
of
arnold
men
the
fittest
of
an
originally
lot
he
still
had
some
wretches
among
his
own
new
yorkers
who
resented
the
air
of
superiority
affected
by
arnold
new
englanders
and
morgan
virginians
he
felt
a
confidence
in
livingston
and
some
of
the
canadian
whom
livingston
had
brought
into
his
camp
before
st
johns
in
september
but
he
began
to
feel
more
and
more
doubtful
about
the
french
canadians
most
of
whom
began
to
feel
more
and
more
doubtful
about
themselves
on
the
he
arrived
before
quebec
and
took
up
his
quarters
in
holland
house
two
miles
beyond
the
walls
at
the
far
end
of
the
plains
of
abraham
the
same
day
he
sent
carleton
the
following
summons
sir
notwithstanding
the
personal
i
have
received
at
your
hands
notwithstanding
your
cruelty
to
the
unhappy
prisoners
you
have
taken
the
feelings
of
humanity
induce
me
to
have
recourse
to
this
expedient
to
save
you
from
the
destruction
which
hangs
over
you
give
me
leave
sir
to
assure
you
that
i
am
well
acquainted
with
your
situation
a
great
extent
of
works
in
their
nature
incapable
of
defence
manned
with
a
motley
crew
of
sailors
the
greatest
part
our
friends
of
citizens
who
wish
to
see
us
within
their
walls
a
few
of
the
worst
troops
who
ever
stiled
themselves
soldiers
the
impossibility
of
relief
and
the
certain
prospect
of
wanting
every
necessary
of
life
should
your
opponents
confine
their
operations
to
a
simple
blockade
point
out
the
absurdity
of
resistance
such
is
your
situation
i
am
at
the
head
of
troops
accustomed
to
success
confident
of
the
righteousness
of
the
cause
they
are
engaged
in
inured
to
danger
so
highly
incensed
at
your
inhumanity
illiberal
abuse
and
the
ungenerous
means
employed
to
prejudice
them
in
the
mind
of
the
canadians
that
it
is
with
difficulty
i
restrain
them
till
my
batteries
are
ready
from
assaulting
your
works
which
afford
them
a
fair
opportunity
of
ample
vengeance
and
just
retaliation
firing
upon
a
flag
of
truce
hitherto
unprecedented
even
among
savages
prevents
my
taking
the
ordinary
mode
of
communicating
my
sentiments
however
i
will
at
any
rate
acquit
my
conscience
should
you
persist
in
an
unwarrantable
defence
the
consequences
be
upon
your
own
head
beware
of
destroying
stores
of
any
kind
publick
or
private
as
you
have
done
at
montreal
and
in
three
rivers
if
you
do
by
heaven
there
will
be
no
mercy
shown
though
montgomery
wrote
bunkum
like
the
common
politician
of
that
and
many
a
later
age
he
was
really
a
brave
soldier
what
galled
him
into
fury
was
quiet
refusal
to
recognize
either
him
or
any
other
rebel
commander
as
the
accredited
leader
of
a
hostile
army
it
certainly
must
have
been
exasperating
for
the
general
of
the
continental
congress
to
be
reduced
to
such
expedients
as
tying
a
grandiloquent
ultimatum
to
an
arrow
and
shooting
it
into
the
beleaguered
town
the
charge
of
firing
on
flags
of
truce
was
another
instance
of
for
buncombe
carleton
never
fired
on
any
white
flag
but
he
always
sent
the
same
answer
that
he
could
hold
no
communication
with
any
rebels
unless
they
came
to
implore
the
king
pardon
this
of
course
was
an
aggravation
of
his
offensive
calmness
in
the
face
of
so
much
revolutionary
rage
to
individual
rebels
of
all
sorts
he
was
if
anything
he
would
not
burn
the
suburbs
of
quebec
till
the
enemy
forced
him
to
it
though
many
of
the
houses
that
gave
the
americans
the
best
cover
belonged
to
rebel
canadians
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
be
kind
to
all
prisoners
especially
if
sick
or
wounded
and
it
was
entirely
owing
to
his
restraining
influence
that
the
friendly
indians
had
not
raided
the
border
settlements
of
new
england
during
the
summer
nor
was
he
animated
only
by
the
very
natural
desire
of
bringing
back
rebellious
subjects
to
what
he
thought
their
true
allegiance
as
his
subsequent
actions
amply
proved
he
simply
acted
with
the
calm
dignity
and
impartial
justice
which
his
position
required
three
days
before
christmas
the
bombardment
began
in
earnest
the
soon
found
to
their
equal
amazement
and
delight
that
a
good
many
shells
did
very
little
damage
if
fired
about
at
random
but
news
intended
to
make
their
flesh
creep
came
in
at
the
same
time
and
probably
had
more
effect
than
the
shells
on
the
members
of
the
community
seven
hundred
no
quarter
if
carleton
persisted
in
holding
out
and
a
prophecy
attributed
to
montgomery
that
he
would
eat
his
christmas
dinner
either
in
quebec
or
in
hell
these
were
some
of
the
items
that
came
in
by
petticoat
or
arrow
post
one
of
the
most
active
purveyors
of
all
this
bombast
was
jerry
duggan
a
canadian
barber
now
become
a
continental
major
but
there
was
a
serious
side
deserters
and
prisoners
as
well
as
british
adherents
who
had
escaped
all
began
to
tell
the
same
tale
though
with
many
variations
montgomery
was
evidently
bent
on
storming
the
walls
the
first
dark
night
his
own
orders
showed
it
head
quarters
holland
house
near
quebec
decr
the
general
having
in
vain
offered
the
most
favourable
terms
of
accommodation
to
the
governor
of
quebec
having
taken
every
possible
step
to
prevail
on
the
inhabitants
to
desist
from
seconding
him
in
his
wild
scheme
of
defending
the
town
for
the
speedy
reduction
of
the
only
hold
possessed
by
the
ministerial
troops
in
this
province
the
soldiers
flushed
with
continual
success
confident
of
the
justice
of
their
cause
relying
on
that
providence
which
has
uniformly
protected
them
will
advance
with
alacrity
to
the
attack
of
works
incapable
of
being
defended
by
the
wretched
garrison
posted
behind
them
consisting
of
sailors
unacquainted
with
the
use
of
arms
of
citizens
incapable
of
soldiers
duty
of
a
few
miserable
emigrants
the
general
is
confident
that
a
vigorous
spirited
attack
must
be
attended
with
success
the
troops
shall
have
the
effects
of
the
governor
garrison
of
such
as
have
been
active
in
misleading
the
inhabitants
distressing
the
friends
of
liberty
equally
divided
among
them
except
the
share
out
of
the
whole
which
shall
be
at
the
disposal
of
the
general
to
be
given
to
such
soldiers
as
distinguished
themselves
by
their
activity
bravery
to
be
sold
at
public
auction
the
whole
to
be
conducted
as
soon
as
the
city
is
in
our
hands
and
the
inhabitants
disarmed
it
was
a
week
after
these
orders
had
been
written
before
the
first
positive
news
of
the
threatened
assault
was
brought
into
town
by
an
escaped
british
prisoner
who
strangely
enough
bore
the
name
of
wolfe
wolfe
escape
naturally
caused
a
postponement
of
montgomery
design
and
a
further
council
of
war
unlike
most
councils
of
war
this
one
was
full
of
fight
three
feints
were
to
be
made
at
different
points
while
the
real
attack
was
to
be
driven
home
at
cape
diamond
but
just
after
this
decision
had
been
reached
two
rebel
montrealers
came
down
and
in
another
debate
carried
the
day
for
another
plan
these
men
antell
and
price
were
really
responsible
for
the
final
plan
which
like
its
predecessor
did
not
meet
with
montgomery
approval
montgomery
wanted
to
make
a
breach
before
trying
the
walls
but
he
was
no
more
than
the
chairman
of
a
committee
and
this
egregious
committee
first
decided
to
storm
the
unbroken
walls
and
then
changed
to
an
attack
on
the
lower
town
only
antell
was
engineer
price
was
a
agitator
both
were
better
at
politics
than
soldiering
their
argument
was
that
if
the
lower
town
could
be
taken
the
quebec
militia
would
force
carleton
to
surrender
in
order
to
save
the
warehouses
shipping
and
other
valuable
property
along
the
waterfront
and
that
even
if
carleton
held
out
in
debate
he
would
soon
be
brought
to
his
knees
by
the
americans
who
would
march
through
the
gates
which
were
to
be
opened
by
the
inside
another
week
passed
and
montgomery
had
not
eaten
his
christmas
dinner
either
in
quebec
or
in
the
other
place
but
both
sides
knew
the
crisis
must
be
fast
approaching
for
the
new
yorkers
had
sworn
that
they
would
not
stay
a
minute
later
than
the
end
of
the
year
when
their
term
of
enlistment
was
up
thus
every
day
that
passed
made
an
immediate
assault
more
likely
as
montgomery
had
to
strike
before
his
own
men
left
him
yet
new
year
eve
itself
began
without
the
sign
of
an
alarm
carleton
had
been
sleeping
in
his
clothes
at
the
recollets
night
after
night
so
that
he
might
be
first
on
parade
at
the
general
rendezvous
on
the
place
which
stood
near
the
top
of
mountain
hill
the
only
road
between
the
upper
and
the
lower
town
officers
and
men
off
duty
had
been
following
his
example
and
every
one
was
ready
to
turn
out
at
a
moment
notice
a
snowstorm
was
blowing
furiously
straight
up
the
st
lawrence
making
quebec
a
partly
seen
blur
to
the
nearest
american
patrols
and
the
heights
of
abraham
a
wild
sea
of
whirling
drifts
to
the
nearest
british
sentries
one
passed
and
nothing
stirred
but
when
two
struck
at
holland
house
montgomery
rose
and
began
to
put
the
council
plan
in
operation
the
lower
town
was
to
be
attacked
at
both
ends
the
barricade
was
to
be
carried
by
montgomery
and
the
by
arnold
while
livingston
was
to
distract
carleton
attention
as
much
as
possible
by
making
a
feint
against
the
landward
walls
where
the
british
still
expected
the
real
attack
canadian
fighting
waded
through
the
drifts
against
the
storm
across
the
plains
and
took
post
close
in
on
the
far
side
of
cape
diamond
only
eighty
yards
from
the
same
walls
that
were
to
have
been
stormed
some
days
before
jerry
duggan
parasitic
canadian
took
post
in
the
suburb
of
st
john
and
thence
round
to
palace
gate
montgomery
led
his
own
column
straight
to
wolfe
cove
whence
he
marched
in
along
the
narrow
path
between
the
cliff
and
the
st
lawrence
till
he
reached
the
spot
at
the
foot
of
cape
diamond
just
under
the
right
of
livingston
line
arnold
whose
quarters
were
in
the
valley
of
the
st
charles
took
post
in
st
roch
with
a
mortar
battery
to
fire
against
the
walls
and
a
column
of
men
to
storm
the
livingston
and
jerry
duggan
whole
command
numbered
about
four
hundred
men
montgomery
five
hundred
arnold
six
the
opposing
totals
were
fifteen
hundred
americans
against
seventeen
hundred
british
there
was
considerable
risk
of
confusion
between
friend
and
foe
as
most
of
the
americans
especially
arnold
men
wore
captured
british
uniforms
with
nothing
to
distinguish
them
but
odds
and
ends
of
their
former
kits
and
a
sort
of
paper
hatband
bearing
the
inscription
or
a
little
after
four
the
sentries
on
the
walls
at
cape
diamond
saw
lights
flashing
about
in
front
of
them
and
were
just
going
to
call
the
guard
when
captain
malcolm
fraser
of
the
royal
emigrants
came
by
on
his
rounds
and
saw
other
lights
being
set
out
in
regular
order
like
lamps
in
a
street
he
instantly
turned
out
the
guards
and
pickets
the
drums
beat
to
arms
every
church
bell
in
the
city
pealed
forth
its
alarm
into
that
wild
night
the
bugles
blew
the
men
off
duty
swarmed
on
to
the
place
where
carleton
calm
and
intrepid
as
ever
took
post
with
the
general
reserve
and
waited
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
just
yet
everything
that
could
have
been
foreseen
had
already
been
amply
provided
for
and
in
his
quiet
confidence
his
followers
found
their
own
towards
five
two
green
rockets
shot
up
from
montgomery
position
beside
the
anse
des
meres
under
cape
diamond
this
was
the
signal
for
attack
column
immediately
struggled
on
again
along
the
path
leading
round
the
foot
of
the
cape
towards
the
barricade
livingston
serious
on
the
top
of
the
cape
changed
their
dropping
shots
into
a
hot
fire
against
the
walls
while
jerry
duggan
little
mob
of
looters
shouted
and
blazed
away
from
safer
cover
in
the
suburbs
of
st
john
and
st
roch
arnold
mortars
pitched
shells
all
over
the
town
while
his
advanced
towards
the
barricade
carleton
naturally
anxious
about
the
landward
walls
sent
some
of
the
british
militia
to
reinforce
the
men
at
cape
diamond
which
as
he
knew
montgomery
considered
the
best
point
of
attack
the
walls
lower
down
did
not
seem
to
be
in
any
danger
from
jerry
duggan
whose
noisy
demonstration
was
at
once
understood
to
be
nothing
but
an
empty
feint
the
walls
facing
the
st
charles
were
well
manned
and
well
gunned
by
the
naval
battalion
those
facing
the
st
lawrence
though
weak
in
themselves
were
practically
impregnable
as
the
cliffs
could
not
be
scaled
by
any
formed
body
the
lower
town
however
was
by
no
means
so
safe
in
spite
of
its
two
barricades
the
general
uproar
was
now
so
great
that
carleton
could
not
distinguish
the
firing
there
from
what
was
going
on
elsewhere
but
it
was
at
these
two
points
that
the
real
attack
was
rapidly
developing
the
first
decisive
action
took
place
at
the
guard
there
consisted
of
fifty
men
john
coffin
who
was
a
merchant
of
quebec
sergeant
hugh
mcquarters
of
the
royal
artillery
captain
barnsfair
a
merchant
skipper
with
fifteen
mates
and
skippers
like
himself
and
thirty
french
canadians
under
captain
chabot
and
lieutenant
picard
these
fifty
men
had
to
guard
a
front
of
only
as
many
feet
on
their
right
cape
diamond
rose
almost
sheer
on
their
left
raged
the
stormy
st
lawrence
they
had
a
tiny
next
to
the
cliff
and
four
small
guns
on
the
barricade
all
with
canister
and
grape
they
had
heard
the
dropping
shots
on
the
top
of
the
cape
for
nearly
an
hour
and
had
been
quick
to
notice
the
change
to
a
regular
hot
fire
but
they
had
no
idea
whether
their
own
post
was
to
be
attacked
or
not
till
they
suddenly
saw
the
head
of
montgomery
column
halting
within
fifty
paces
of
them
a
man
came
forward
cautiously
and
looked
at
the
barricade
the
storm
was
in
his
face
the
defences
were
wreathed
in
whirling
snow
and
the
men
inside
kept
silent
as
the
grave
when
he
went
back
a
little
group
stood
for
a
couple
of
minutes
in
hurried
consultation
then
montgomery
waved
his
sword
called
out
on
brave
boys
quebec
is
ours
and
led
the
charge
the
defenders
let
the
americans
get
about
before
barnsfair
shouted
then
the
guns
and
muskets
volleyed
together
cutting
down
the
whole
front
of
the
densely
massed
column
montgomery
his
two
and
his
ten
leading
men
were
instantly
killed
some
more
farther
back
were
wounded
and
just
as
the
fifty
british
fired
their
second
round
the
rest
of
the
five
hundred
americans
turned
and
ran
in
wild
confusion
a
few
minutes
later
a
man
whose
identity
was
never
established
came
running
from
the
lower
town
to
say
that
arnold
men
had
taken
the
barricade
if
this
was
true
it
meant
that
the
fifty
would
be
caught
between
two
fires
some
of
them
made
as
if
to
run
back
and
reach
mountain
hill
before
the
americans
could
cut
them
off
but
coffin
at
once
threatened
to
kill
the
first
man
to
move
and
by
the
time
an
artillery
officer
had
arrived
with
reinforcements
perfect
order
had
been
restored
this
officer
finding
he
was
not
wanted
there
sent
back
to
know
where
else
he
was
to
go
and
received
an
answer
telling
him
to
hurry
to
the
when
he
arrived
there
less
than
half
a
mile
off
he
found
that
desperate
street
fighting
had
been
going
on
for
over
an
hour
arnold
advance
had
begun
at
the
same
time
as
demonstration
and
montgomery
attack
but
his
task
was
very
different
and
the
time
required
much
longer
there
were
three
obstacles
to
be
overcome
first
his
men
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
fire
from
the
bluejackets
ranged
along
the
grand
battery
which
faced
the
st
charles
at
its
mouth
and
overlooked
the
narrow
little
street
of
at
a
height
of
fifty
or
sixty
feet
then
they
had
to
take
the
small
advanced
barricade
which
stood
a
hundred
yards
on
the
st
charles
side
of
the
actual
or
sailor
leap
which
is
the
point
of
the
quebec
promontory
and
nearly
a
hundred
feet
high
finally
they
had
to
round
this
point
and
attack
the
regular
barricade
this
second
barricade
was
about
a
hundred
yards
long
from
the
rock
to
the
river
it
crossed
street
and
st
peter
street
which
were
the
same
then
as
now
but
it
ended
on
a
wharf
down
the
modern
st
james
street
as
the
outer
half
of
this
street
was
then
a
natural
strand
completely
covered
at
high
tide
it
was
much
closer
than
the
barricade
was
to
mountain
hill
at
the
top
of
which
carleton
held
his
general
reserve
ready
in
the
place
and
it
was
fairly
strong
in
material
and
armament
but
it
was
at
first
defended
by
only
a
hundred
men
the
american
forlorn
hope
under
captain
oswald
got
past
most
of
the
grand
battery
unscathed
but
by
the
time
the
main
body
was
following
under
morgan
the
british
were
firing
down
from
the
walls
at
less
than
range
the
driving
snow
the
clumps
of
bushes
on
the
cliff
and
the
little
houses
in
the
street
below
all
gave
the
americans
some
welcome
cover
but
many
of
them
were
hit
while
the
gun
they
were
towing
through
the
drifts
on
a
sleigh
stuck
fast
and
had
to
be
abandoned
captain
dearborn
the
future
of
the
american
army
in
the
war
of
noted
in
his
diary
that
he
the
wounded
men
very
thick
as
he
was
bringing
up
the
rear
when
the
forlorn
hope
reached
the
advanced
barricade
arnold
halted
it
till
the
supports
had
come
up
the
loss
of
the
gun
and
the
worrying
his
main
body
was
receiving
from
the
sailors
along
the
grand
battery
spoilt
his
original
plan
of
smashing
in
the
barricade
by
shell
fire
while
morgan
circled
round
its
outer
flank
on
the
ice
of
the
tidal
flats
and
took
it
in
rear
so
he
decided
on
a
frontal
attack
when
he
thought
he
had
a
fair
chance
he
stepped
to
the
front
and
shouted
boys
all
together
rush
but
before
he
could
climb
the
barricade
he
was
shot
through
the
leg
for
some
time
he
propped
himself
up
against
a
house
and
leaning
on
his
rifle
continued
encouraging
his
men
who
were
soon
firing
through
the
as
well
as
over
the
top
but
presently
growing
faint
from
loss
of
blood
he
had
to
be
carried
off
the
field
to
the
general
hospital
on
the
banks
of
the
st
charles
the
men
now
called
out
for
a
lead
from
morgan
who
climbed
a
ladder
leaped
the
top
and
fell
under
a
gun
inside
in
another
minute
the
whole
forlorn
hope
had
followed
him
while
the
main
body
came
close
behind
the
guard
not
strong
in
numbers
and
weak
in
being
composed
of
young
militiamen
gave
way
but
kept
on
firing
with
your
arms
if
you
want
quarter
yelled
morgan
whose
men
were
in
overwhelming
strength
and
the
guard
surrendered
a
little
way
beyond
just
under
the
bluff
of
the
the
british
supports
many
of
whom
were
seminary
students
also
surrendered
to
morgan
who
at
once
pressed
on
round
the
corner
of
the
and
halted
in
sight
of
the
second
or
regular
barricade
what
was
to
be
done
now
where
was
montgomery
how
strong
was
the
barricade
and
had
it
been
reinforced
it
could
not
be
turned
because
the
cliff
rose
sheer
on
one
flank
while
the
icy
st
lawrence
lashed
the
other
had
morgan
known
that
there
were
only
a
hundred
men
behind
it
when
he
attacked
its
advanced
barricade
he
might
have
pressed
on
at
all
costs
and
carried
it
by
assault
but
it
looked
strong
there
were
guns
on
its
platforms
and
it
ran
across
two
streets
his
hurried
council
of
war
him
as
montgomery
council
had
the
original
plan
of
storming
the
walls
and
so
his
men
began
a
desultory
fight
in
the
streets
and
from
the
houses
this
was
fatal
to
american
success
the
original
british
hundred
were
rapidly
reinforced
the
artillery
officer
who
had
found
that
he
was
not
needed
at
the
after
montgomery
defeat
and
who
had
hurried
across
the
intervening
now
occupied
the
corner
houses
enlarged
the
embrasures
and
trained
his
guns
on
the
houses
occupied
by
the
enemy
detachments
of
fusiliers
and
royal
emigrants
also
arrived
as
did
the
masters
and
mates
of
merchant
vessels
who
were
not
on
guard
with
barnsfair
at
the
thus
what
with
soldiers
sailors
and
militiamen
of
both
races
the
main
barricade
was
made
secure
against
being
rushed
like
the
outer
one
but
there
was
plenty
of
fighting
with
some
confusion
at
close
quarters
caused
by
the
british
uniforms
which
both
sides
were
wearing
a
herculean
sailor
seized
the
first
ladder
the
americans
set
against
the
barricade
hauled
it
up
and
set
it
against
the
window
of
a
house
out
of
the
far
end
of
which
the
enemy
were
firing
major
nairne
and
lieutenant
dambourges
of
the
royal
emigrants
at
once
climbed
in
at
the
head
of
a
and
wild
work
followed
with
the
bayonet
all
the
americans
inside
were
either
killed
or
captured
meanwhile
a
vigorous
british
had
been
turned
on
another
house
they
occupied
this
house
was
likewise
battered
in
so
that
its
surviving
occupants
had
to
run
into
the
street
where
they
were
well
plied
with
musketry
by
the
regulars
and
militiamen
the
chance
for
a
sortie
then
seeming
favourable
lieutenant
anderson
of
the
navy
headed
his
merchant
mates
and
skippers
in
a
rush
along
street
but
his
effort
was
premature
morgan
shot
him
dead
and
morgan
virginians
drove
the
seamen
back
inside
the
barricade
carleton
had
of
course
kept
in
perfect
touch
with
every
phase
of
the
attack
and
defence
and
now
fearing
no
surprise
against
the
walls
in
the
growing
daylight
had
decided
on
taking
arnold
men
in
rear
to
do
this
he
sent
captain
lawes
of
the
royal
engineers
and
captain
mcdougall
of
the
royal
emigrants
with
a
hundred
and
twenty
men
out
through
palace
gate
this
detachment
had
hardly
reached
the
advanced
barricade
before
they
fell
in
with
the
enemy
rearguard
which
they
took
by
complete
surprise
and
captured
to
a
man
leaving
mcdougall
to
secure
these
prisoners
before
following
on
lawes
pushed
eagerly
forward
round
the
corner
of
the
cliff
and
running
in
among
the
americans
facing
the
main
barricade
called
out
are
all
my
prisoners
we
not
you
ours
they
answered
no
replied
lawes
as
coolly
as
if
on
parade
mistake
yourselves
i
vow
to
god
you
mine
where
are
your
men
asked
the
astonished
americans
and
then
lawes
suddenly
found
that
he
was
utterly
alone
the
roar
of
the
storm
and
the
work
of
securing
the
prisoners
on
the
far
side
of
the
advanced
barricade
had
prevented
the
men
who
should
have
followed
him
from
understanding
that
only
a
few
were
needed
with
mcdougall
but
lawes
put
a
bold
face
on
it
and
answered
ho
make
yourselves
easy
my
men
are
all
round
here
and
they
be
with
you
in
a
twinkling
he
was
then
seized
and
disarmed
some
of
the
americans
called
out
him
kill
him
but
a
major
meigs
protected
him
the
whole
parley
had
lasted
about
ten
minutes
when
mcdougall
came
running
up
with
the
missing
men
released
lawes
and
made
prisoners
of
the
nearest
americans
lawes
at
once
stepped
forward
and
called
on
the
rest
to
surrender
morgan
was
for
cutting
his
way
through
a
few
men
ran
round
by
the
wharf
and
escaped
on
the
tidal
flats
of
the
st
charles
but
after
a
hurried
consultation
the
main
body
including
morgan
laid
down
their
arms
this
was
decisive
the
british
had
won
the
fight
the
complete
british
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
was
wonderfully
small
only
thirty
just
of
the
corresponding
american
loss
which
was
large
out
of
all
proportion
nearly
half
of
the
fifteen
hundred
americans
had
gone
over
four
hundred
prisoners
and
about
three
hundred
killed
and
wounded
nor
were
the
mere
numbers
the
most
telling
point
about
it
for
the
worse
half
escaped
livingston
montreal
many
of
whom
had
done
very
little
fighting
montgomery
new
yorkers
most
of
whom
wanted
to
go
home
and
jerry
duggan
miscellaneous
rabble
all
of
whom
wanted
a
maximum
of
plunder
with
a
minimum
of
war
the
british
victory
was
as
nearly
perfect
as
could
have
been
desired
it
marked
the
turn
of
the
tide
in
a
desperate
campaign
which
might
have
resulted
in
the
total
loss
of
canada
and
it
was
of
the
greatest
significance
and
happiest
augury
because
all
the
racial
elements
of
this
new
and
vast
domain
had
here
united
for
the
first
time
in
defence
of
that
which
was
to
be
their
common
heritage
in
carleton
little
garrison
of
regulars
and
militia
of
bluejackets
marines
and
merchant
seamen
there
were
frenchmen
and
french
canadians
there
were
englishmen
irishmen
scotsmen
welshmen
orcadians
and
channel
islanders
there
were
a
few
newfoundlanders
and
there
mere
a
good
many
of
those
steadfast
royal
emigrants
who
may
be
fitly
called
the
forerunners
of
the
united
empire
loyalists
yet
in
spite
of
this
remarkable
significance
no
public
memorial
of
carleton
has
ever
been
set
up
and
it
was
only
in
the
twentieth
century
that
the
dominion
first
thought
of
commemorating
his
most
pregnant
victory
by
placing
tablets
to
mark
the
sites
of
the
two
famous
barricades
as
soon
as
things
had
quieted
down
within
the
walls
carleton
sent
out
to
bring
in
the
dead
for
decent
burial
and
to
see
if
any
of
the
wounded
had
been
overlooked
james
thompson
the
assistant
engineer
saw
a
frozen
hand
protruding
from
a
snowdrift
at
it
was
montgomery
the
thirteen
bodies
were
dug
out
and
thompson
was
ordered
to
have
a
coffin
made
for
mr
montgomery
who
was
buried
in
the
wall
just
above
st
louis
gate
by
the
anglican
chaplain
thompson
kept
montgomery
sword
which
was
given
to
the
livingston
family
more
than
a
century
later
the
beleaguerment
continued
in
a
way
till
the
spring
the
americans
received
various
small
reinforcements
which
eventually
brought
their
total
up
to
what
it
had
been
under
montgomery
command
but
there
were
no
more
assaults
arnold
grew
dissatisfied
and
finally
went
to
montreal
while
wooster
the
new
general
who
arrived
on
the
of
april
was
himself
succeeded
by
thomas
an
on
the
of
may
the
suburb
of
st
roch
was
burnt
down
after
the
victory
so
the
american
snipers
were
bereft
of
some
very
favourite
cover
and
this
with
other
causes
kept
the
bulk
of
the
besiegers
at
an
ineffective
distance
from
the
walls
the
british
garrison
had
certain
little
troubles
of
its
own
for
discipline
always
tends
to
become
irksome
after
a
great
effort
carleton
was
obliged
to
stop
the
retailing
of
spirits
for
fear
the
slacker
men
would
be
getting
out
of
hand
the
guards
and
duties
were
made
as
easy
as
possible
especially
for
the
militia
but
the
parade
was
an
imperative
necessity
the
winter
was
very
stormy
and
the
drifts
would
have
frequently
covered
the
walls
and
even
the
guns
if
they
had
not
promptly
been
dug
out
the
cold
was
also
unusually
severe
one
early
morning
in
january
an
angry
officer
was
asking
a
sentry
why
he
had
challenged
him
when
the
sentry
said
bless
your
honour
and
i
glad
you
come
for
blind
then
it
was
found
that
his
eyelids
were
frozen
fast
together
news
came
in
occasionally
from
the
outside
world
there
was
intense
indignation
among
the
garrison
when
they
learned
that
the
american
commanders
in
montreal
were
imprisoning
every
canadian
officer
who
would
not
surrender
his
commission
such
an
outrage
was
worthy
of
walker
but
others
must
have
thought
of
it
for
walker
was
now
in
philadelphia
giving
all
the
evidence
he
could
against
prescott
and
other
british
officers
bad
news
for
the
rebels
was
naturally
welcomed
especially
anything
about
their
growing
failure
to
raise
troops
in
canada
on
hearing
of
montgomery
defeat
the
continental
congress
had
passed
a
resolution
addressed
to
the
of
canada
declaring
that
will
never
abandon
you
to
the
unrelenting
fury
of
your
and
our
enemies
but
there
were
no
trained
soldiers
to
back
this
up
and
the
raw
militia
though
often
filled
with
zeal
and
courage
could
do
nothing
to
redress
the
increasingly
adverse
balance
in
the
middle
of
march
the
americans
sent
in
a
summons
but
carleton
refused
to
receive
it
and
the
garrison
put
a
wooden
horse
and
a
bundle
of
hay
on
the
walls
with
a
placard
bearing
the
inscription
this
horse
has
eaten
this
bunch
of
hay
we
will
surrender
some
excellent
practice
made
with
shells
sent
the
americans
flying
from
their
new
battery
at
levis
and
by
the
of
march
one
of
the
several
exultant
british
diarists
whose
anonymity
must
have
covered
an
irish
name
was
able
to
record
that
being
st
patrick
day
the
governor
who
is
a
true
hibernian
has
requested
the
garrison
to
put
off
keeping
it
till
the
of
may
when
he
promises
they
shall
be
enabled
to
do
it
properly
and
with
the
usual
solemnities
a
fortnight
later
a
plot
concerted
between
the
american
prisoners
and
their
friends
outside
was
discovered
just
in
time
with
tools
supplied
by
traitors
they
were
to
work
their
way
out
of
their
quarters
overpower
the
guard
at
the
nearest
gate
set
fire
to
the
nearest
houses
in
three
different
streets
turn
the
nearest
guns
inwards
on
the
town
and
shout
for
ever
as
an
additional
signal
to
the
that
was
to
be
waiting
to
confirm
their
success
carleton
seized
the
chance
of
turning
this
scheme
against
the
enemy
three
safe
bonfires
were
set
ablaze
the
marked
guns
were
turned
inwards
and
fired
at
the
town
with
blank
charges
and
the
preconcerted
shout
was
raised
with
a
will
but
the
besiegers
never
stirred
after
this
the
among
the
prisoners
who
had
taken
the
oath
and
enlisted
in
the
garrison
were
disarmed
and
confined
while
the
rest
were
more
strictly
watched
two
brave
attempts
were
made
by
french
canadians
to
reach
quebec
with
reinforcements
one
headed
by
a
seigneur
the
other
by
a
parish
priest
carleton
had
sent
word
to
de
beaujeu
seigneur
of
crane
island
forty
miles
below
quebec
asking
him
to
see
if
he
could
cut
off
the
american
detachment
on
the
levis
shore
de
beaujeu
raised
three
hundred
and
fifty
men
but
arnold
sent
over
reinforcements
a
habitant
betrayed
his
a
dozen
french
canadians
were
then
killed
or
wounded
while
forty
were
taken
prisoners
whereupon
the
rest
dispersed
to
their
homes
the
other
attempt
was
made
by
father
bailly
whose
little
force
of
about
fifty
men
was
also
betrayed
entrapped
in
a
these
men
fought
bravely
till
nearly
half
their
number
had
been
killed
or
wounded
and
the
valiant
priest
had
been
mortally
hit
they
then
surrendered
to
a
much
stronger
force
which
had
lost
more
men
than
they
this
was
on
the
of
april
just
before
arnold
was
leaving
in
disgust
wooster
made
an
effort
to
use
his
new
artillery
to
advantage
by
converging
the
fire
of
three
batteries
one
close
in
on
the
heights
of
abraham
another
from
across
the
mouth
of
the
st
charles
and
the
third
from
levis
but
the
combination
failed
the
batteries
were
too
light
for
the
work
and
overmatched
by
the
guns
on
the
walls
the
practice
was
bad
and
the
effect
was
nil
on
the
of
may
the
new
general
thomas
an
enterprising
man
tried
a
fireship
which
was
meant
to
destroy
all
the
shipping
in
the
cul
de
sac
it
came
on
under
full
sail
in
a
very
threatening
manner
but
the
crew
lost
their
nerve
at
the
critical
moment
took
to
the
boats
too
soon
and
forgot
to
lash
the
helm
the
vessel
immediately
flew
up
into
the
wind
and
as
the
tidal
stream
was
already
changing
began
to
drift
away
from
the
cul
de
sac
just
when
she
burst
into
flame
the
result
as
described
by
an
enthusiastic
british
diarist
was
that
affoard
a
very
pritty
prospect
while
she
was
floating
down
the
river
every
now
then
sending
up
sky
rackets
firing
of
cannon
or
bursting
of
shells
so
continued
till
she
disappear
in
the
channell
three
days
later
on
the
of
may
when
the
beleaguerment
had
lasted
precisely
five
months
the
sound
of
distant
gunfire
came
faintly
up
the
st
lawrence
with
the
first
breath
of
the
dawn
wind
from
the
east
the
sentries
listened
to
make
sure
then
called
the
sergeants
of
the
guards
who
sent
word
to
the
officers
on
duty
who
in
their
turn
sent
word
to
carleton
by
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
the
breeze
was
freshening
the
sound
was
gradually
nearing
quebec
and
there
could
hardly
be
room
for
doubting
that
it
came
from
the
vanguard
of
the
british
fleet
the
drums
beat
to
arms
the
church
bells
rang
the
news
flew
round
to
every
household
in
quebec
and
before
the
tops
of
the
frigate
were
seen
over
the
point
of
levy
every
battery
was
fully
manned
every
battalion
was
standing
ready
on
the
grand
parade
and
every
man
woman
and
child
was
lining
the
seaward
wall
the
regulation
shot
was
fired
across
her
bows
as
she
neared
the
city
whereupon
she
fired
three
guns
to
leeward
hoisted
the
private
signal
and
showed
the
union
jack
then
at
last
a
cheer
went
up
that
told
both
friend
and
foe
of
british
victory
and
american
defeat
by
a
strange
coincidence
the
parole
for
this
triumphal
day
was
st
george
while
the
parole
appointed
for
the
victorious
new
year
eve
had
been
st
denis
so
that
the
patron
saints
of
france
and
england
happen
to
be
associated
with
the
two
great
days
on
which
the
stronghold
of
canada
was
saved
by
land
and
sea
the
same
tide
brought
in
two
other
some
soldiers
of
the
who
were
on
board
the
were
immediately
landed
together
with
the
marines
from
all
three
vessels
carleton
called
for
volunteers
from
the
militia
to
attack
the
americans
at
once
and
nearly
every
man
both
of
the
and
of
the
corps
stepped
forward
there
was
joy
in
every
heart
that
the
day
for
striking
back
had
come
at
last
the
columns
marched
gaily
through
the
gates
and
deployed
into
line
at
the
double
on
the
heights
outside
the
americans
fired
a
few
hurried
shots
and
then
ran
for
dear
life
leaving
their
dinners
cooking
and
in
some
cases
even
their
arms
behind
them
the
plains
were
covered
with
flying
enemies
and
strewn
with
every
sort
of
impediment
to
flight
from
a
cannon
to
a
loaf
of
bread
quebec
had
been
saved
by
british
and
with
it
the
whole
vast
dominion
of
which
it
was
the
key
chapter
vi
deliverance
the
continental
congress
had
always
been
anxious
to
have
delegates
from
the
fourteenth
colony
but
as
these
never
came
the
congress
finally
decided
to
send
a
special
commission
to
examine
the
whole
civil
and
military
state
of
canada
and
see
what
could
be
done
the
news
of
montgomery
death
and
defeat
was
a
very
unwelcome
surprise
but
reinforcements
were
being
sent
the
canadians
could
surely
be
persuaded
and
a
congressional
commission
must
be
able
to
set
things
right
this
commission
was
a
very
strong
one
benjamin
franklin
was
the
chairman
samuel
chase
of
maryland
and
charles
carroll
of
carrollton
were
the
other
members
carroll
brother
the
future
archbishop
of
baltimore
accompanied
them
as
a
sort
of
ecclesiastical
diplomatist
franklin
prestige
and
the
fact
that
he
was
to
set
up
a
in
montreal
were
to
work
wonders
with
the
educated
classes
at
once
and
with
the
uneducated
masses
later
on
chase
would
appeal
to
all
the
reasonable
carroll
a
great
landlord
and
the
nearest
approach
yet
made
to
an
american
millionaire
was
expected
to
charm
the
canadian
noblesse
while
the
fact
that
he
and
his
exceedingly
diplomatic
brother
were
devout
roman
catholics
was
thought
to
be
by
itself
a
powerful
argument
with
the
clergy
when
they
reached
st
johns
towards
the
end
of
april
the
commissioners
sent
on
a
courier
to
announce
their
arrival
and
prepare
for
their
proper
reception
in
montreal
but
the
ferryman
at
laprairie
positively
refused
to
accept
continental
paper
money
at
any
price
and
it
was
only
when
a
of
liberty
gave
him
a
dollar
in
silver
that
he
consented
to
cross
the
courier
over
the
st
lawrence
the
same
hitch
occurred
in
montreal
where
the
same
friend
of
liberty
had
to
pay
in
silver
before
the
consented
to
accept
a
fare
either
from
him
or
from
the
commissioners
even
the
name
of
carroll
of
carrollton
was
conjured
with
in
vain
the
french
canadians
remembered
bigot
bad
french
paper
their
worst
suspicions
were
being
confirmed
about
the
equally
bad
american
paper
so
they
demanded
nothing
but
hard
cash
however
the
first
great
obstacle
had
been
successfully
overcome
and
so
on
the
strength
of
five
borrowed
silver
dollars
the
accredited
commissioners
of
the
continental
congress
of
the
thirteen
colonies
made
their
state
entry
into
what
they
still
hoped
to
call
the
fourteenth
colony
but
silver
dollars
were
scarce
and
on
the
of
may
the
crestfallen
commissioners
had
to
send
the
congress
a
financial
report
which
may
best
be
summed
up
in
a
pithy
phrase
which
soon
became
proverbial
worth
a
continental
on
the
of
may
they
heard
the
bad
news
from
quebec
and
increased
the
panic
among
their
montreal
sympathizers
by
hastily
leaving
the
city
lest
they
should
be
cut
off
by
a
british
franklin
foresaw
the
end
and
left
for
philadelphia
accompanied
by
the
reverend
john
carroll
whose
twelve
days
of
disheartening
experience
with
the
leading
clergy
had
convinced
him
that
they
were
impervious
to
any
arguments
or
blandishments
emanating
from
the
continental
congress
it
was
a
sad
disillusionment
for
the
commissioners
who
had
expected
to
be
settling
the
affairs
of
a
fourteenth
colony
instead
of
being
obliged
to
leave
the
city
from
which
they
were
to
have
enlightened
the
people
with
a
free
press
in
their
first
angry
ignorance
they
laid
the
whole
blame
on
their
unfortunate
army
for
its
flight
from
quebec
a
week
later
when
chase
and
charles
carroll
ought
to
have
known
better
they
were
still
assuring
the
congress
that
this
retreat
was
principal
cause
of
all
the
disorders
in
the
army
and
even
after
the
whole
story
ought
to
have
been
understood
neither
they
nor
the
congress
gave
their
army
its
proper
due
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
american
position
had
become
untenable
the
moment
the
british
fleet
began
to
threaten
the
american
line
of
communication
with
montreal
for
the
rest
the
american
volunteers
all
things
considered
had
done
very
well
indeed
arnold
march
was
a
truly
magnificent
feat
morgan
men
had
fought
with
great
courage
at
the
and
though
montgomery
assault
might
well
have
been
better
planned
and
executed
we
must
remember
that
the
good
plan
which
had
been
rejected
was
the
military
one
while
the
bad
plan
which
had
been
adopted
was
concocted
by
mere
politicians
nor
were
the
disorders
so
severely
condemned
by
the
commissioners
due
to
the
army
alone
far
from
it
indeed
the
root
of
the
disorders
lay
in
the
fact
that
a
makeshift
government
was
obliged
to
use
makeshift
levies
for
an
invasion
which
required
a
regular
army
supported
by
a
fleet
on
the
of
may
another
disaster
happened
this
time
above
montreal
the
congress
had
not
felt
strong
enough
to
attack
the
western
posts
so
captain
forster
of
the
foot
finding
that
he
was
free
to
go
elsewhere
had
come
down
from
oswegatchie
the
modern
ogdensburg
with
a
hundred
whites
and
two
hundred
indians
and
made
prisoners
of
four
hundred
and
thirty
americans
at
the
cedars
about
thirty
miles
up
the
st
lawrence
from
montreal
forster
was
a
very
good
officer
butterfield
the
american
commander
was
a
very
bad
one
and
that
made
all
the
difference
after
two
days
of
feeble
and
misdirected
defence
butterfield
surrendered
three
hundred
and
fifty
men
the
other
eighty
were
reinforcements
who
walked
into
the
trap
next
day
forster
now
had
four
american
prisoners
for
every
white
soldier
of
his
own
while
arnold
was
near
by
having
come
up
from
sorel
to
lachine
with
a
small
but
determined
force
so
forster
carefully
pointing
out
to
his
prisoners
their
danger
if
the
indians
should
be
reinforced
and
run
wild
offered
them
their
freedom
on
condition
that
they
should
be
regarded
as
being
exchanged
for
an
equal
number
of
british
prisoners
in
american
hands
this
was
agreed
to
and
never
made
a
matter
of
dispute
afterwards
but
the
second
article
butterfield
accepted
was
a
stipulation
that
while
the
released
british
were
to
be
free
to
fight
again
the
released
americans
were
not
and
it
was
over
this
point
that
a
bitter
controversy
raged
the
british
authorities
maintained
that
all
the
terms
were
binding
because
they
had
been
accepted
by
an
officer
commissioned
by
the
congress
the
congress
maintained
that
the
disputed
article
was
obtained
by
an
unfair
threat
of
an
indian
massacre
and
that
it
was
so
as
to
be
good
for
nothing
but
repudiation
affair
at
the
cedars
thus
became
a
sorely
vexed
question
in
itself
it
would
have
died
out
among
later
and
more
important
issues
if
it
had
not
been
used
as
a
torch
to
fire
american
public
opinion
at
a
time
when
the
congress
was
particularly
anxious
to
make
the
thirteen
colonies
as
as
possible
most
of
men
were
indians
he
had
reminded
butterfield
how
dangerous
an
increasing
number
of
indians
might
become
butterfield
was
naturally
anxious
to
prove
that
he
had
yielded
only
to
overwhelming
odds
and
horrifying
risks
americans
in
general
were
ready
to
believe
anything
bad
about
the
indians
and
the
british
the
temptation
and
the
opportunity
seemed
made
for
each
other
and
so
a
quite
imaginary
indian
massacre
conveniently
appeared
in
the
american
news
of
the
day
and
helped
to
form
the
kind
of
public
opinion
which
was
ardently
desired
by
the
party
of
revolt
the
british
evidence
in
this
and
many
another
embittering
dispute
about
the
indians
need
not
be
cited
since
the
following
items
of
american
evidence
do
ample
justice
to
both
sides
in
the
spring
of
the
massachusetts
provincial
congress
sent
samuel
kirkland
to
exhort
the
iroquois
whet
their
hatchet
and
be
prepared
to
defend
our
liberties
and
lives
while
ethan
allen
asked
the
indians
round
vermont
to
treat
him
a
brother
and
ambush
the
regulars
in
the
continental
congress
secretly
resolved
it
is
highly
expedient
to
engage
the
indians
in
the
service
of
the
united
colonies
this
was
before
the
members
knew
about
the
affair
at
the
cedars
a
few
days
later
washington
was
secretly
authorized
to
raise
two
thousand
indians
while
agents
were
secretly
sent
engage
the
six
nations
in
our
interest
on
the
best
terms
that
can
be
procured
within
three
weeks
of
this
secret
arrangement
the
declaration
of
independence
publicly
accused
the
king
of
trying
bring
on
the
inhabitants
of
our
frontiers
the
merciless
indian
savages
four
days
after
this
public
accusation
the
congress
gave
orders
for
raising
indians
along
penobscot
the
st
john
and
in
nova
scotia
and
an
entry
to
that
effect
was
made
in
its
secret
journal
yet
before
the
month
was
out
the
same
congress
publicly
appealed
to
people
of
ireland
in
the
following
words
wild
and
barbarous
savages
of
the
wilderness
have
been
solicited
by
gifts
to
take
up
the
hatchet
against
us
and
instigated
to
deluge
our
settlements
with
the
blood
of
defenceless
women
and
children
the
american
defeats
at
quebec
and
at
the
cedars
completely
changed
the
position
of
the
two
remaining
commissioners
they
had
expected
to
control
a
victorious
advance
they
found
themselves
the
highest
authority
present
with
a
disastrous
retreat
thereupon
they
made
blunder
after
blunder
public
interest
and
parliamentary
control
are
the
very
life
of
armies
and
navies
in
every
country
which
enjoys
the
blessings
of
but
civilian
interference
is
death
yet
chase
and
carroll
practically
abolished
rank
in
the
disintegrating
army
by
becoming
an
open
court
of
appeal
to
every
junior
with
a
grievance
or
a
plan
there
never
was
an
occasion
on
which
military
rule
was
more
essential
in
military
matters
yet
though
they
candidly
admitted
that
they
had
abilities
nor
inclination
to
command
these
wretched
misrulers
tried
to
do
their
duty
both
to
the
congress
and
the
army
by
turning
the
camp
into
a
sort
of
town
meeting
where
the
best
orders
had
no
chance
whatever
against
the
loudest
they
had
themselves
found
the
root
of
all
evil
in
the
retreat
from
quebec
their
army
like
every
impartial
critic
found
it
in
commissioners
and
the
smallpox
with
the
commissioners
easily
first
the
smallpox
had
been
bad
enough
at
quebec
it
became
far
worse
at
sorel
there
were
few
doctors
fewer
medicines
and
not
a
single
hospital
the
reinforcements
melted
away
with
the
army
they
were
meant
to
strengthen
famine
threatened
both
even
in
may
finally
the
commissioners
left
for
home
at
the
end
of
the
month
but
even
their
departure
could
no
longer
make
the
army
burden
light
enough
to
bear
thomas
the
who
did
his
best
to
stem
the
adverse
tide
of
trouble
caught
the
smallpox
became
blind
and
died
at
the
beginning
of
june
sullivan
the
fourth
commander
in
less
than
half
a
year
having
determined
that
one
more
effort
should
be
made
arrived
at
sorel
with
new
battalions
after
innumerable
difficulties
by
the
way
he
was
led
to
believe
that
reinforcements
had
come
from
nova
scotia
not
from
england
and
this
encouraged
him
to
push
on
farther
he
was
naturally
of
a
very
sanguine
temper
and
thompson
his
heartily
approved
of
the
dash
the
new
troops
cheered
up
and
thought
of
taking
quebec
itself
but
after
getting
misled
by
their
guide
floundering
about
in
bottomless
bogs
and
losing
a
great
deal
of
very
precious
time
they
found
three
rivers
defended
by
entrenchments
superior
numbers
and
the
vanguard
of
the
british
fleet
nevertheless
they
attacked
bravely
on
the
of
june
but
taken
in
front
and
flank
by
regulars
and
they
presently
broke
and
fled
every
avenue
of
escape
was
closed
as
they
wandered
about
the
woods
and
bogs
but
carleton
who
came
up
from
quebec
after
the
battle
was
all
over
purposely
opened
the
way
to
sorel
he
had
done
his
best
to
win
the
hearts
of
his
prisoners
at
quebec
and
had
succeeded
so
well
that
when
they
returned
to
crown
point
they
were
kept
away
from
the
rest
of
the
american
army
lest
their
account
of
his
kindness
should
affect
its
zeal
now
that
he
was
in
overwhelming
force
he
thought
he
saw
an
even
better
chance
of
earning
gratitude
from
rebels
and
winning
converts
to
the
loyal
side
by
a
still
greater
act
of
clemency
the
battle
of
three
rivers
was
the
last
action
fought
on
canadian
soil
the
american
army
retreated
to
sorel
and
up
the
richelieu
to
st
johns
where
it
was
joined
by
arnold
who
had
just
evacuated
montreal
most
of
the
friends
of
liberty
in
canada
fled
either
with
or
before
their
beaten
forces
so
like
the
ebbing
of
a
whole
river
system
the
main
and
tributary
streams
of
fugitives
drew
south
towards
lake
champlain
the
neutral
french
canadians
turned
against
them
at
once
though
not
to
the
extent
of
making
an
actual
attack
the
habitant
cared
nothing
for
the
incomprehensible
constitutionalities
over
which
different
kinds
of
british
foreigners
were
fighting
their
exasperating
civil
war
but
he
did
know
what
the
big
fleet
and
army
meant
he
did
begin
to
feel
that
his
own
ways
of
life
were
safer
with
the
loyal
than
with
the
rebel
side
and
he
quite
understood
that
he
had
been
forced
to
give
a
good
deal
for
nothing
ever
since
the
american
commissioners
had
authorized
their
famishing
army
to
commandeer
his
supplies
and
pay
him
with
their
worthless
from
st
johns
the
americans
crawled
homewards
in
stray
exhausted
parties
dropping
fast
by
the
way
as
they
went
did
not
look
into
a
hut
or
a
tent

a
horrified
observer
which
i
did
not
find
a
dead
or
dying
man
disorganization
became
so
complete
that
no
exact
returns
were
ever
made
up
but
it
is
known
that
over
ten
thousand
armed
men
crossed
into
canada
from
first
to
last
and
that
not
far
short
of
half
this
total
either
found
their
death
beyond
the
line
or
brought
it
back
with
them
to
lake
champlain
it
was
on
what
long
afterwards
became
dominion
day
the
of
july
that
the
ruined
american
forces
reassembled
at
crown
point
having
abandoned
all
hope
of
making
canada
the
fourteenth
colony
three
days
later
the
disappointed
thirteen
issued
the
declaration
of
independence
which
virtually
proclaimed
that
canadians
and
americans
should
thenceforth
live
a
separate
life
chapter
vii
the
counterstroke
six
thousand
british
troops
commanded
by
burgoyne
and
four
thousand
germans
commanded
by
baron
riedesel
had
arrived
at
quebec
before
the
battle
of
three
rivers
quebec
itself
had
then
been
left
to
the
care
of
a
german
garrison
under
a
german
commandant
excellent
man
colonel
baum
while
the
great
bulk
of
the
army
had
marched
up
the
st
lawrence
as
we
have
seen
already
such
a
force
as
this
new
one
of
carleton
was
expected
to
dismay
the
rebel
colonies
and
so
to
a
great
extent
it
did
with
a
much
larger
force
in
the
colonies
themselves
the
king
was
confidently
expected
to
master
his
unruly
subjects
no
matter
how
much
they
proclaimed
their
independence
the
loyalists
were
encouraged
the
trimmers
prepared
to
join
them
only
those
steadfast
americans
who
held
their
cause
dearer
than
life
itself
were
still
determined
to
venture
all
but
they
formed
the
one
party
that
really
knew
its
own
mind
this
gave
them
a
great
advantage
over
the
king
party
which
hampered
at
every
turn
by
the
opposition
in
the
mother
country
was
never
quite
sure
whether
it
ought
to
strike
hard
or
gently
in
america
on
one
point
however
everybody
was
agreed
the
command
of
lake
champlain
was
essential
to
whichever
side
would
hold
its
own
the
american
forces
at
crown
point
might
be
too
weak
for
the
time
being
but
arnold
knew
that
even
ten
thousand
british
soldiers
could
not
overrun
the
land
without
a
naval
force
to
help
them
so
he
got
together
a
flotilla
which
had
everything
its
own
way
during
the
time
that
carleton
was
laboriously
building
a
rival
flotilla
on
the
richelieu
with
a
very
scanty
supply
of
and
materials
arnold
moreover
could
devote
his
whole
attention
to
the
work
makeshift
as
it
had
to
be
while
carleton
was
obliged
to
keep
moving
about
the
province
in
an
effort
to
bring
it
into
some
sort
of
order
after
the
late
invasion
throughout
the
summer
the
british
army
held
the
line
of
the
richelieu
all
the
way
south
as
far
as
very
near
the
lake
and
the
line
but
carleton
flotilla
could
not
set
sail
from
st
johns
till
october
by
which
time
the
main
body
of
his
army
was
concentrated
round
at
the
northern
end
of
the
lake
ninety
miles
north
of
the
american
camp
at
crown
point
it
was
a
curious
situation
for
a
civil
and
military
governor
to
be
hoisting
his
flag
as
a
naval
however
small
the
fleet
might
be
but
it
is
commonly
ignored
that
down
to
the
present
day
the
of
canada
is
appointed
of
the
same
in
his
commissions
from
the
crown
carleton
of
course
carried
expert
naval
officers
with
him
and
had
enough
professional
seamen
to
work
the
vessels
and
lay
the
guns
but
though
captain
pringle
manoeuvred
the
flotilla
and
lieutenant
dacre
handled
the
flagship
the
actual
command
remained
in
own
hands
the
capital
ship
and
the
only
real
of
this
lilliputian
fleet
was
which
had
been
taken
up
the
richelieu
in
sections
and
hauled
past
the
portages
with
immense
labour
before
reaching
st
johns
whence
there
is
a
clear
run
upstream
to
lake
champlain
the
carried
thirty
guns
mostly
and
was
an
overmatch
for
quite
the
half
of
arnold
decidedly
weaker
flotilla
the
was
a
sort
of
sister
ship
to
the
the
little
armada
was
completed
by
a
with
six
by
twenty
gunboats
and
four
longboats
each
carrying
a
single
piece
and
by
many
small
craft
used
as
transports
on
the
of
october
carleton
whole
naval
force
was
sailing
south
when
one
of
arnold
vessels
was
seen
making
for
valcour
island
a
few
miles
still
farther
south
on
the
same
or
western
side
of
lake
champlain
presently
the
yankee
ran
ashore
on
the
southern
end
of
the
island
where
she
was
immediately
attacked
by
some
british
small
craft
while
the
sailed
on
then
to
the
intense
disgust
of
the
crew
complete
flotilla
was
suddenly
discovered
drawn
up
in
a
masterly
position
between
the
mainland
and
the
island
it
was
too
late
for
the
to
beat
back
now
but
the
rest
of
carleton
flotilla
turned
in
to
the
attack
arnold
flanks
rested
on
the
island
and
the
mainland
his
rear
could
be
approached
only
by
beating
back
against
a
bad
wind
all
the
way
round
the
outside
of
valcour
island
and
even
if
this
manoeuvre
could
have
been
performed
the
british
attack
on
his
rear
from
the
north
could
have
been
made
only
in
a
piecemeal
way
because
the
channel
was
there
at
its
narrowest
with
a
bad
obstruction
in
the
middle
so
for
every
reason
a
frontal
attack
from
the
south
was
the
one
way
of
closing
with
him
the
fight
was
furious
while
it
lasted
and
seemingly
decisive
when
it
ended
arnold
best
vessel
the
which
he
had
taken
at
st
johns
the
year
before
was
driven
ashore
and
captured
the
others
were
so
severely
mauled
that
when
the
victorious
british
anchored
their
superior
force
in
line
across
front
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
for
him
to
escape
the
following
day
but
that
night
he
performed
an
even
more
daring
and
wonderful
feat
than
bouchette
had
performed
the
year
before
when
paddling
carleton
through
the
american
lines
among
the
islands
opposite
sorel
using
muffled
sweeps
with
consummate
skill
he
slipped
all
his
remaining
vessels
between
the
mainland
and
the
nearest
british
gunboat
and
was
well
on
his
way
to
crown
point
before
his
escape
had
been
discovered
next
day
carleton
chased
south
the
day
after
he
destroyed
the
whole
of
the
miniature
as
a
fighting
force
but
the
only
three
serviceable
vessels
got
away
while
arnold
burnt
everything
else
likely
to
fall
into
british
hands
so
carleton
had
no
more
than
his
own
reduced
flotilla
to
depend
on
when
he
occupied
crown
point
a
vexed
question
destined
to
form
part
of
a
momentous
issue
now
arose
should
ticonderoga
be
attacked
at
once
or
not
it
commanded
the
only
feasible
line
of
march
from
montreal
to
new
york
and
no
force
from
canada
could
therefore
attack
the
new
republic
effectively
without
taking
it
first
but
the
season
was
late
the
fort
was
strong
well
gunned
and
well
manned
reconnaissance
convinced
him
that
he
could
have
little
chance
of
reducing
it
quickly
if
at
all
with
the
means
at
hand
especially
as
the
americans
had
supplies
close
by
at
lake
george
while
he
was
now
a
hundred
miles
south
of
his
base
a
winter
siege
was
impossible
sufficient
supplies
could
never
be
brought
through
the
dense
bush
all
the
way
from
canada
even
if
the
long
and
harassing
line
of
communications
had
not
been
everywhere
open
to
american
attack
moreover
carleton
army
was
in
no
way
prepared
for
a
midwinter
campaign
even
if
it
could
have
been
supplied
with
food
and
warlike
stores
so
he
very
sensibly
turned
his
back
on
lake
champlain
until
the
following
year
that
was
the
gayest
winter
quebec
had
seen
since
first
season
twenty
years
before
carleton
had
been
knighted
for
his
services
and
was
naturally
supposed
to
be
the
chosen
leader
for
the
next
campaign
the
ten
thousand
troops
gave
confidence
to
the
loyalists
and
promised
success
for
the
coming
campaign
the
clergy
were
getting
their
disillusioned
parishioners
back
to
the
fold
beneath
the
union
jack
while
himself
was
fain
to
admit
that
his
own
ways
of
life
and
the
money
he
got
for
his
goods
were
very
much
safer
with
than
with
the
revolutionists
whom
he
called
because
most
trade
between
quebec
and
the
thirteen
colonies
was
carried
on
by
vessels
hailing
from
the
port
of
boston
the
seigneurs
were
delighted
they
still
hoped
for
commissions
as
regulars
which
too
few
of
them
ever
received
and
they
were
charmed
with
the
little
viceregal
court
over
which
lady
maria
carleton
despite
her
youthful
summers
presided
with
a
dignity
inherited
from
the
premier
ducal
family
of
england
and
brought
to
the
acme
of
conventional
perfection
by
her
intimate
experience
of
versailles
on
new
year
eve
carleton
gave
a
public
fete
a
state
dinner
and
a
ball
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
the
british
victory
over
montgomery
and
arnold
the
bishop
held
a
special
thanksgiving
and
made
all
notorious
renegades
do
open
penance
nothing
seemed
wanting
to
bring
the
new
year
in
under
the
happiest
auspices
since
british
rule
began
but
quite
unknown
to
carleton
mischief
was
brewing
in
the
colonial
office
of
that
unhappy
government
which
did
so
many
stupid
things
and
got
the
credit
for
so
many
more
in
the
earl
of
dartmouth
was
superseded
by
lord
george
germain
who
continued
the
mismanagement
of
colonial
affairs
for
seven
disastrous
years
few
characters
have
abused
civil
and
military
positions
more
than
the
man
who
first
as
a
british
general
disgraced
the
noble
name
of
sackville
on
the
battlefield
of
minden
in
and
then
as
a
cabinet
minister
disgraced
throughout
america
the
plebeian
one
of
germain
which
he
took
in
with
a
suitable
legacy
attached
to
it
his
crime
at
minden
was
set
down
by
the
thoughtless
public
to
sheer
cowardice
but
sackville
was
no
coward
he
had
borne
himself
with
conspicuous
gallantry
at
fontenoy
he
was
admired
before
minden
by
two
very
brave
soldiers
wolfe
and
the
duke
of
cumberland
and
he
afterwards
fought
a
famous
duel
with
as
much
as
any
one
would
care
to
see
his
real
crime
at
minden
was
admirably
exposed
by
the
which
found
him
of
having
disobeyed
the
orders
of
prince
ferdinand
of
brunswick
whom
he
was
by
his
commission
bound
to
obey
as
according
to
the
rules
of
war
this
court
also
found
him
to
serve
his
majesty
in
any
military
capacity
whatever
and
george
ii
directed
that
the
following
should
be
added
when
the
sentence
was
read
out
on
parade
to
every
regiment
in
the
service
is
his
majesty
pleasure
that
the
above
sentence
be
given
out
in
public
orders
not
only
in
britain
but
in
america
and
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
where
british
troops
happen
to
be
so
that
all
officers
being
convinced
that
neither
high
birth
nor
great
employments
can
shelter
offences
of
such
a
nature
and
seeing
they
are
subject
to
censures
worse
than
death
to
a
man
who
has
any
sense
of
honour
may
avoid
the
fatal
consequences
arising
from
disobedience
of
orders
this
seemed
to
mark
the
end
of
sackville
sinister
career
but
when
george
ii
died
and
george
iii
began
to
reign
with
a
very
different
set
of
men
to
help
him
the
bad
general
reappeared
as
an
equally
bad
politician
haughty
cantankerous
and
to
the
last
degree
germain
who
had
many
perverse
abilities
fitting
him
for
the
meaner
side
of
party
politics
was
appointed
to
the
post
for
which
he
was
least
qualified
just
when
canada
and
the
thirteen
colonies
most
needed
a
master
mind
worse
still
he
cherished
a
contemptible
grudge
against
carleton
for
having
refused
to
turn
out
a
good
officer
and
put
in
a
bad
one
who
happened
to
be
a
pampered
favourite
at
first
however
carleton
was
allowed
to
do
his
best
but
in
the
summer
of
germain
restricted
carleton
command
to
canada
and
put
burgoyne
a
junior
officer
in
command
of
the
army
destined
to
make
the
counterstroke
the
ship
bearing
this
malicious
order
had
to
put
back
so
it
was
not
till
the
middle
of
may
that
carleton
was
disillusioned
by
its
arrival
as
well
as
by
a
second
and
still
more
exasperating
dispatch
accusing
him
of
neglect
of
duty
for
not
having
taken
ticonderoga
in
november
and
thus
prevented
washington
from
capturing
the
hessians
at
trenton
the
physical
impossibility
of
a
winter
siege
the
three
hundred
miles
of
hostile
country
between
trenton
and
ticonderoga
and
the
fact
that
the
other
leading
british
general
howe
had
thirty
thousand
troops
in
the
colonies
while
carleton
had
only
ten
thousand
with
which
to
hold
canada
that
year
and
act
as
ordered
next
year
all
went
for
nothing
when
germain
found
a
chance
to
give
a
good
stab
in
the
back
on
may
carleton
wrote
a
pungent
reply
pointing
out
the
utter
impossibility
of
following
up
his
victory
on
lake
champlain
by
carrying
out
germain
plan
of
operations
in
the
middle
of
winter
regard
it
as
a
particular
blessing
that
your
lordship
dispatch
did
not
arrive
in
due
time
as
for
the
disaster
at
trenton
he
to
inform
his
lordship
that
if
howe
thirty
thousand
men
had
been
properly
used
the
hessians
could
never
have
been
taken
all
the
rebels
from
ticonderoga
had
reinforced
mr
washington
army
moreover
never
could
imagine
why
if
troops
so
far
south
as
howe
found
it
necessary
to
go
into
winter
quarters
your
lordship
could
possibly
expect
troops
so
far
north
to
continue
their
operations
a
week
later
carleton
wrote
again
and
sent
in
his
resignation
that
i
can
no
longer
be
of
use
under
your
administration
i
flatter
myself
i
shall
obtain
the
king
permission
to
return
home
this
fall
i
shall
embark
with
great
satisfaction
still
entertaining
the
ardent
wish
that
after
my
departure
the
dignity
of
the
crown
in
this
unfortunate
province
may
not
appear
beneath
your
lordship
concern
burgoyne
had
spent
the
winter
in
london
and
had
arrived
at
quebec
about
the
same
time
as
germain
dispatches
he
had
loyally
represented
carleton
plans
at
headquarters
but
he
did
not
know
america
and
he
was
not
great
enough
to
see
the
weak
points
in
the
plan
which
germain
proposed
to
carry
out
with
wholly
inadequate
means
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
actual
idea
of
this
plan
washington
carleton
and
every
other
leading
man
on
either
side
saw
perfectly
well
that
the
british
army
ought
to
cut
the
rebels
in
two
by
holding
the
direct
line
from
montreal
to
new
york
throughout
the
coming
campaign
of
given
the
irresistible
british
command
of
the
sea
fifty
thousand
troops
were
enough
the
general
idea
was
that
half
of
these
should
hold
the
line
of
the
richelieu
lake
champlain
and
the
hudson
while
the
other
half
seized
strategic
points
elsewhere
and
still
further
divided
the
american
forces
but
the
troops
employed
were
ten
thousand
short
of
the
proper
number
many
of
them
were
foreign
mercenaries
and
the
generals
were
not
the
men
to
smash
the
enemy
at
all
costs
they
were
ready
to
do
their
duty
but
their
affinities
were
rather
with
the
opposition
which
was
against
the
war
than
with
the
government
which
was
for
it
howe
was
a
strong
whig
burgoyne
became
a
follower
of
fox
clinton
had
many
whig
connections
cornwallis
voted
against
colonial
taxation
to
make
matters
worse
the
government
itself
wavered
between
war
and
some
sort
of
compromise
both
with
its
political
opponents
at
home
and
its
armed
opponents
in
america
under
these
circumstances
carleton
was
in
favour
of
a
modified
plan
ticonderoga
had
been
abandoned
by
the
americans
and
occupied
by
the
british
as
burgoyne
marched
south
carleton
idea
was
to
use
it
as
a
base
of
operations
against
new
england
while
howe
main
body
struck
at
the
main
body
of
the
rebels
and
broke
them
up
as
much
as
possible
germain
however
was
all
for
the
original
plan
so
burgoyne
set
off
for
the
hudson
expecting
to
get
into
touch
with
howe
at
albany
but
germain
in
his
haste
to
leave
town
for
a
holiday
forgot
to
sign
howe
orders
at
the
proper
time
and
afterwards
forgot
them
altogether
so
howe
in
politics
and
temporizer
in
the
field
manoeuvred
round
his
own
headquarters
at
new
york
until
october
when
he
sailed
south
to
philadelphia
receiving
no
orders
from
germain
and
having
no
initiative
of
his
own
he
had
made
no
attempt
to
hold
the
line
of
the
hudson
all
the
way
north
to
albany
where
he
could
have
met
burgoyne
and
completed
the
union
of
the
forces
which
would
have
cut
the
colonies
in
two
meanwhile
burgoyne
ignorant
of
germain
neglect
and
futilities
was
struggling
to
his
fate
at
saratoga
north
of
albany
he
had
been
receiving
constant
aid
from
carleton
scanty
resources
though
carleton
knew
full
well
that
the
sending
of
any
aid
beyond
the
limits
of
the
province
exposed
him
to
personal
ruin
in
case
of
a
reverse
in
canada
but
it
was
all
in
vain
and
on
the
of
october
burgoyne
much
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
laid
down
his
arms
the
british
garrison
immediately
evacuated
ticonderoga
and
retired
to
st
johns
thus
making
carleton
position
fairly
safe
in
canada
but
germain
only
too
glad
to
oust
him
had
now
notified
him
that
haldimand
the
new
governor
was
on
the
point
of
sailing
for
quebec
haldimand
to
his
great
credit
had
asked
to
have
his
own
appointment
cancelled
when
he
heard
of
germain
shameful
attitude
towards
carleton
and
had
only
consented
to
go
after
being
satisfied
that
carleton
really
wished
to
come
home
the
exchange
however
was
not
to
take
place
that
year
contrary
winds
blew
haldimand
back
and
so
canada
had
to
remain
under
the
best
of
all
possible
governors
in
spite
of
germain
germain
had
provoked
carleton
past
endurance
both
by
his
public
blunders
and
by
his
private
malice
even
in
there
was
hate
on
one
side
contempt
on
the
other
when
germain
had
blamed
carleton
for
not
carrying
out
the
idiotic
winter
siege
of
ticonderoga
carleton
in
his
official
reply
only
suppose
that
his
lordship
had
acted
other
places
with
such
great
wisdom
that
without
our
assistance
the
rebels
must
immediately
be
compelled
to
lay
down
their
arms
and
implore
the
mercy
after
that
germain
had
murder
in
his
heart
to
the
bitter
end
of
carleton
rule
carleton
had
frequently
reported
the
critical
state
of
affairs
in
canada
is
nothing
to
fear
from
the
canadians
so
long
as
things
are
in
a
state
of
prosperity
nothing
to
hope
from
them
when
in
distress
there
are
some
of
them
who
are
guided
by
sentiments
of
honour
the
multitude
is
influenced
by
hope
of
gain
or
fear
of
punishment
the
recent
invasion
had
proved
this
up
to
the
hilt
then
welcome
reaction
began
the
defeat
of
the
invaders
the
arrival
of
army
and
the
efforts
of
the
seigneurs
and
the
clergy
had
considerably
brightened
the
prospects
of
the
british
cause
in
canada
the
partial
mobilization
of
the
militia
which
followed
burgoyne
surrender
was
not
indeed
a
great
success
but
it
was
far
better
than
the
fiasco
of
two
years
before
there
was
also
a
corresponding
improvement
in
civil
life
the
judges
whom
carleton
had
been
obliged
to
appoint
in
haste
all
proved
at
leisure
the
wisdom
of
his
choice
and
there
seemed
to
be
every
chance
that
other
nominees
would
be
equally
fit
for
their
positions
because
the
quebec
act
which
annulled
every
appointment
made
before
it
came
into
force
opened
the
way
for
the
exclusion
of
bad
officials
and
the
inclusion
of
the
good
but
the
chance
of
perverting
this
excellent
intention
was
too
much
for
germain
who
succeeded
in
foisting
one
worthless
nominee
after
another
on
the
province
just
as
carleton
was
doing
his
best
to
heal
old
sores
one
of
the
worst
cases
was
that
of
livius
a
german
portuguese
who
ousted
the
future
master
of
the
rolls
sir
william
grant
a
man
most
admirably
fitted
to
interpret
the
laws
of
canada
with
knowledge
sympathy
and
absolute
impartiality
livius
as
chief
justice
was
more
than
carleton
could
stand
in
silence
this
mongrel
lawyer
had
picked
up
all
the
yankee
vices
without
acquiring
any
of
the
countervailing
yankee
virtues
he
was
of
power
more
greedy
of
gain
imperious
and
impetuous
in
his
temper
but
learned
in
the
ways
and
eloquence
of
the
new
england
provinces
and
valuing
himself
particularly
on
his
knowledge
of
how
to
manage
governors
he
had
been
sent
by
germain
administer
justice
to
the
canadians
when
he
understands
neither
their
laws
manners
customs
nor
language
other
like
nominees
followed
regardless
of
the
public
tranquility
but
zealous
to
pay
court
to
a
powerful
minister
and
provided
they
can
obtain
advantages
unconcerned
should
the
means
of
obtaining
them
prove
ruinous
to
the
king
service
these
pettifoggers
so
turned
and
twisted
the
law
about
for
the
sake
of
screwing
out
the
maximum
of
fees
that
carleton
pointedly
refused
to
appoint
livius
as
a
member
of
the
legislative
council
livius
then
laid
his
case
before
the
privy
council
in
england
but
this
great
court
of
ultimate
appeal
pronounced
such
a
damning
judgment
on
his
gross
pretensions
that
even
germain
could
not
prevent
his
final
dismissal
from
all
employment
under
the
crown
wounded
in
the
house
of
those
who
should
have
been
his
friends
thwarted
in
every
measure
of
his
rule
carleton
served
on
devotedly
through
six
weary
months
of
the
year
in
which
a
vindictive
government
of
bourbon
france
became
the
first
of
the
several
foreign
enemies
who
made
the
new
american
republic
an
accomplished
fact
by
taking
sides
in
a
british
civil
war
his
burden
was
now
far
more
than
any
man
could
bear
yet
he
closed
his
answer
to
germain
parting
shot
with
words
which
are
as
noble
as
his
deeds
have
long
looked
out
for
the
arrival
of
a
successor
happy
at
last
to
learn
his
near
approach
i
resign
the
important
commands
with
which
i
have
been
entrusted
into
hands
less
obnoxious
to
your
lordship
thus
for
the
king
service
as
willingly
i
lay
them
down
as
for
his
service
i
took
them
up
chapter
viii
guarding
the
loyalists
burgoyne
surrender
marked
the
turning
of
the
tide
against
the
british
arms
true
the
three
campaigns
of
purely
civil
war
begun
in
had
reached
no
decisive
result
true
also
that
the
independence
declared
in
had
no
apparent
chance
of
becoming
an
accomplished
fact
but
was
the
fatal
year
for
all
that
the
long
political
strife
in
england
the
gross
mismanagement
of
colonial
affairs
under
germain
and
the
shameful
blunders
that
made
saratoga
possible
all
combined
to
encourage
foreign
powers
to
take
the
field
against
the
incompetent
and
distracted
ministry
france
spain
and
holland
joined
the
americans
in
arms
while
russia
sweden
denmark
prussia
and
all
the
german
seaboard
countries
formed
the
armed
neutrality
of
the
north
this
made
stupendous
odds
no
less
than
ten
to
one
first
of
the
ten
came
the
political
opposition
at
home
which
in
regard
to
the
american
rebellion
itself
was
at
least
equal
to
the
most
powerful
enemy
abroad
next
came
the
four
enemies
in
arms
the
american
rebels
france
spain
and
holland
finally
came
the
five
armed
neutrals
all
ready
to
use
their
navies
on
the
slightest
provocation
from
this
it
may
be
seen
that
not
perhaps
not
a
quarter
of
all
the
various
forces
that
won
the
revolutionary
war
were
purely
american
nor
were
the
americans
and
their
allies
together
victorious
over
the
mother
country
but
only
over
one
sorely
hampered
party
in
it
yet
from
the
nature
of
the
case
the
americans
got
much
more
than
the
lion
share
of
the
spoils
while
even
in
their
own
eyes
they
seemed
to
have
gained
honour
and
glory
in
the
same
proportion
the
last
real
campaign
was
fought
in
and
ended
with
the
british
surrender
at
yorktown
from
that
time
on
peace
was
in
the
air
the
unfortunate
ministry
now
on
the
eve
of
political
defeat
at
home
were
sick
of
civil
war
and
only
too
anxious
for
a
chance
of
uniting
all
parties
against
the
foreign
foes
but
they
had
first
to
settle
with
the
americans
who
had
considered
themselves
an
independent
sovereign
power
for
the
last
five
years
and
who
were
determined
to
make
the
most
of
england
difficulties
no
darker
new
year
day
had
ever
dawned
on
any
cabinet
than
that
of
on
north
in
spite
of
his
change
from
repression
to
conciliation
and
in
spite
of
dismissing
germain
to
the
house
of
lords
with
an
peerage
lord
north
found
his
majority
dwindling
away
at
last
on
the
of
march
he
resigned
meanwhile
every
real
statesman
in
either
party
had
felt
that
the
crisis
required
the
of
carleton
with
germain
the
gone
carleton
would
doubtless
have
served
under
any
cabinet
for
no
government
could
have
done
without
him
but
his
actual
commission
came
through
the
rockingham
administration
on
the
of
april
after
three
quiet
years
of
retirement
at
his
country
seat
in
hampshire
he
was
again
called
upon
to
face
a
situation
of
extreme
difficulty
for
once
with
a
wisdom
rare
enough
in
any
age
and
almost
unknown
in
that
one
the
government
gave
him
a
free
hand
and
almost
unlimited
powers
the
only
questions
over
which
he
had
no
final
power
were
those
of
making
treaties
he
was
appointed
and
of
all
his
majesty
forces
within
the
colonies
lying
in
the
atlantic
ocean
from
nova
scotia
to
the
floridas
and
inclusive
of
newfoundland
and
canada
should
they
be
attacked
he
was
also
appointed
commissioner
for
executing
the
terms
of
any
treaty
that
might
be
made
and
his
instructions
contained
two
passages
which
bore
eloquent
witness
to
the
universal
confidence
reposed
in
him
is
impossible
to
judge
of
the
precise
situation
at
so
great
a
and
majesty
affairs
are
so
situated
that
further
deliberations
give
way
to
instant
decision
we
are
satisfied
that
whatever
inconveniences
may
arise
they
will
be
compensated
by
the
presence
of
a
of
whose
discretion
conduct
and
ability
his
majesty
has
long
entertained
the
highest
opinion
thus
the
great
justifier
of
british
rule
beyond
the
seas
arrived
in
new
york
on
the
of
may
with
at
least
some
hope
of
reconciling
enough
americans
to
turn
the
scale
before
it
was
too
late
for
three
months
the
prospect
though
worse
than
he
had
anticipated
did
not
seem
utterly
hopeless
it
had
been
considerably
brightened
by
rodney
great
victory
over
the
french
fleet
which
was
on
its
way
to
attack
jamaica
but
an
unfortunate
incident
happened
to
be
exasperating
loyalists
and
revolutionists
at
this
very
time
some
revolutionists
had
killed
a
loyalist
named
philip
white
apparently
out
of
pure
hate
some
loyalists
under
captain
lippincott
then
seized
and
hanged
joshua
huddy
a
captain
in
the
congress
militia
out
of
sheer
revenge
a
paper
left
pinned
on
huddy
breast
bore
the
inscription
goes
huddy
for
philip
white
washington
then
demanded
that
lippincott
should
be
delivered
up
and
on
refusal
chose
a
british
prisoner
by
lot
instead
the
lot
fell
on
a
young
lieutenant
asgill
of
the
guards
whose
mother
appealed
to
the
king
and
queen
of
france
and
to
their
powerful
minister
vergennes
the
american
congress
wanted
blood
for
blood
which
would
have
led
to
an
endless
vendetta
but
vergennes
pointed
out
that
asgill
a
youth
of
nineteen
was
as
much
a
prisoner
of
the
king
of
france
as
of
the
continental
congress
at
this
the
congress
gnashed
its
teeth
but
had
to
give
way
while
the
asgill
affair
was
still
running
its
course
and
embittering
loyalists
and
rebels
more
than
ever
carleton
was
suddenly
informed
that
the
government
had
decided
to
grant
complete
independence
this
was
more
than
he
could
stand
and
he
at
once
asked
to
be
recalled
he
had
been
all
for
honourable
reconciliation
from
the
first
he
had
been
particularly
kind
to
his
american
prisoners
in
canada
and
had
purposely
refrained
from
annihilating
the
american
army
after
the
battle
of
three
rivers
but
he
was
not
prepared
for
independence
nor
had
he
been
sent
out
with
this
ostensible
object
in
view
his
official
instructions
were
to
inform
the
americans
that
most
liberal
sentiments
had
taken
root
in
the
nation
and
that
the
narrow
policy
of
monopoly
was
totally
extinguished
now
he
was
called
upon
to
surrender
without
having
tried
either
his
arms
or
his
diplomacy
with
british
beginning
to
reassert
its
superiority
over
all
possible
rivals
with
practically
all
constitutional
points
of
dispute
conceded
to
the
revolutionists
and
with
the
certain
knowledge
that
by
no
means
the
majority
of
all
americans
were
absolute
he
thought
it
no
time
to
dismember
the
empire
his
intelligence
department
had
been
busily
collecting
information
which
seems
surprising
enough
as
we
read
it
over
but
which
was
based
on
the
solid
facts
of
that
unhappy
time
one
member
of
the
continental
congress
was
anxious
to
know
what
would
become
of
the
american
army
if
reconciliation
should
be
effected
on
the
understanding
that
there
would
be
no
more
imperial
taxation
or
customs
duty
would
it
become
part
of
the
imperial
army
or
what
but
speculation
on
all
such
contingencies
was
suddenly
cut
short
by
the
complete
change
of
policy
at
home
the
idea
was
to
end
the
civil
war
that
had
divided
the
empire
and
to
concentrate
on
the
foreign
war
that
at
least
united
the
people
of
great
britain
no
matter
at
what
cost
this
policy
had
now
to
be
carried
out
and
carleton
was
the
only
man
that
every
one
would
trust
to
do
it
so
sacrificing
his
own
feelings
and
convictions
he
made
the
best
of
an
exceedingly
bad
business
he
had
to
safeguard
the
prisoners
and
loyalists
while
preparing
to
evacuate
the
few
remaining
footholds
of
british
power
in
the
face
of
an
implacable
foe
at
the
same
time
he
had
to
watch
every
other
point
in
north
america
and
keep
in
touch
with
his
excellent
naval
colleague
admiral
digby
lest
his
own
rear
might
be
attacked
by
the
three
foreign
enemies
of
england
he
was
even
ordered
off
to
the
west
indies
in
the
autumn
but
fortunately
arrived
before
he
could
start
thus
surrounded
by
enemies
in
front
and
rear
and
on
both
flanks
he
spent
the
seven
months
between
august
and
the
following
march
at
the
end
of
march
news
arrived
that
the
preliminary
treaty
of
peace
had
been
signed
the
final
treaty
was
not
signed
till
his
birthday
the
of
the
following
september
the
signature
of
the
preliminaries
simplified
the
naval
and
military
situation
but
it
made
the
situation
of
the
loyalists
worse
than
ever
compared
with
them
the
prisoners
of
war
had
been
most
highly
favoured
from
the
first
and
yet
the
british
prisoners
had
little
to
thank
the
congress
for
that
they
were
badly
fed
and
badly
housed
was
not
always
the
fault
of
the
americans
but
that
political
favourites
and
underlings
were
allowed
to
prey
on
them
was
an
inexcusable
disgrace
when
a
prisoner
complained
he
was
told
it
was
the
fault
of
the
british
government
which
would
not
pay
for
his
keep
this
answer
so
contrary
to
all
the
accepted
usages
of
war
which
reserve
such
payments
till
after
the
conclusion
of
peace
was
no
empty
gibe
for
when
some
time
before
the
preliminaries
had
been
signed
the
british
and
american
commissioners
met
to
effect
an
exchange
of
prisoners
the
americans
began
by
claiming
the
immediate
payment
of
what
the
british
prisoners
had
cost
them
this
of
course
broke
up
the
meeting
at
once
in
the
meantime
the
german
prisoners
in
british
pay
were
offered
their
freedom
at
eighty
dollars
a
head
then
farmers
came
forward
to
buy
up
these
prisoners
at
this
price
but
the
farmers
found
competitors
in
the
recruiting
sergeants
who
urged
the
germans
with
only
too
much
truth
not
to
become
slaves
of
farmers
but
to
follow
glorious
trade
of
war
against
their
employers
the
british
government
to
their
honour
be
it
said
these
germans
kept
faith
with
the
british
much
to
the
surprise
of
the
americans
who
like
many
modern
writers
could
not
understand
that
these
foreign
mercenaries
took
a
professional
pride
in
carrying
out
a
sworn
contract
even
when
it
would
pay
them
better
to
break
it
the
british
prisoners
were
not
put
up
for
sale
in
the
same
way
but
money
sent
to
them
had
a
habit
of
disappearing
on
the
road
one
item
mentioned
by
carleton
amounted
to
six
thousand
pounds
if
such
was
the
happy
lot
of
prisoners
during
the
war
what
was
the
wretched
lot
of
loyalists
after
the
treaty
of
peace
the
words
of
one
of
the
many
petitions
sent
in
to
carleton
will
suggest
the
answer
we
have
to
encounter
this
inexpressible
misfortune
we
beg
consideration
for
our
lives
fortunes
and
property
not
by
mere
terms
of
what
this
means
can
not
be
appreciated
unless
we
fully
realize
how
strong
the
spirit
of
hate
and
greed
had
grown
and
why
it
had
grown
so
strong
the
american
revolution
had
not
been
provoked
by
oppression
violence
and
massacre
the
and
slavery
of
revolutionary
orators
was
only
a
figure
of
speech
the
real
causes
were
constitutional
and
personal
and
the
actual
crux
of
the
question
was
one
of
payment
for
defence
of
course
there
were
many
other
causes
at
work
the
social
religious
and
political
grudges
with
which
so
many
emigrants
had
left
the
mother
country
had
not
been
forgotten
and
were
now
revived
commercial
restrictions
however
well
they
agreed
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
were
galling
to
such
keen
traders
and
the
mere
difference
between
colonies
and
motherland
had
produced
misunderstandings
on
both
sides
but
the
main
provocative
cause
was
imperial
taxation
for
local
defence
the
thirteen
colonies
could
not
have
held
their
own
by
land
or
sea
much
less
could
they
have
conquered
their
french
rivals
without
the
imperial
forces
which
indeed
had
done
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
fighting
how
was
the
cost
to
be
shared
between
the
mother
country
and
themselves
the
colonies
had
not
been
asked
to
pay
more
than
their
share
the
point
was
whether
they
could
be
taxed
at
all
by
the
imperial
government
when
they
had
no
representation
in
the
imperial
parliament
the
government
said
yes
the
colonies
and
the
opposition
at
home
said
no
as
the
colonies
would
not
pay
of
their
own
accord
and
as
the
government
did
not
see
why
they
should
be
parasites
on
the
armed
strength
of
the
mother
country
parliament
proceeded
to
tax
them
they
then
refused
to
pay
under
compulsion
and
a
complete
deadlock
ensued
the
personal
factors
in
this
perhaps
insoluble
problem
were
still
more
refractory
than
the
constitutional
all
the
great
questions
of
peace
and
war
and
other
foreign
relations
were
settled
by
the
mother
country
which
was
the
only
sovereign
power
and
which
alone
possessed
the
force
to
make
any
british
rights
respected
the
americans
supplied
subordinate
means
and
so
became
subordinate
men
when
they
and
the
imperial
forces
worked
together
this
to
use
a
homely
phrase
made
their
leaders
feel
out
of
it
everything
that
breeds
trouble
between
militiamen
and
regulars
colonials
and
fanned
the
flame
of
colonial
resentment
till
the
leaders
were
able
to
set
their
followers
on
fire
it
was
a
rebellion
there
was
no
maddening
cruelty
or
even
oppression
such
as
those
which
have
produced
so
many
revolutions
elsewhere
it
was
a
leaders
victory
there
was
no
general
feeling
that
death
or
independence
were
the
only
alternatives
from
the
first
but
as
the
fight
went
on
and
loyalists
and
revolutionists
grew
more
and
more
bitter
towards
one
another
the
revolutionary
followers
found
the
same
cause
for
hating
the
loyalists
as
their
leaders
had
found
for
hating
the
government
many
of
the
loyalists
belonged
to
the
and
classes
so
the
envy
and
greed
of
the
revolutionary
followers
were
added
to
the
personal
and
political
rage
of
their
leaders
the
british
government
had
done
its
best
for
the
loyalists
in
the
treaty
of
peace
and
had
urged
carleton
who
needed
no
urging
in
such
a
cause
to
do
his
best
as
well
but
the
treaty
was
made
with
the
congress
and
the
congress
had
no
authority
over
the
internal
affairs
of
the
thirteen
new
states
each
one
of
which
could
do
as
it
liked
with
its
own
envied
and
detested
loyalists
the
revolutionists
wanted
some
tangible
spoils
the
safety
of
peace
had
made
the
trimmers
equally
and
equally
clamorous
so
the
confiscation
of
loyalist
property
soon
became
the
order
of
the
day
it
was
not
the
custom
of
that
age
to
confiscate
private
property
simply
because
the
owners
were
on
the
losing
side
still
less
to
confiscate
it
under
local
instead
of
national
authority
but
need
greed
and
resentment
were
stronger
than
any
scruples
need
was
the
weakest
resentment
the
strongest
of
all
the
animating
motives
the
american
army
was
in
rags
and
its
pay
greatly
in
arrears
while
the
british
forces
under
carleton
were
fed
clothed
and
paid
in
the
regular
way
but
it
was
the
passionate
resentment
of
the
revolutionists
that
perverted
this
exasperating
difference
into
another
wrong
washington
was
above
such
meaner
measures
but
when
he
said
the
loyalists
were
only
fit
for
suicide
and
when
adams
another
future
president
said
they
ought
to
be
hanged
it
is
little
wonder
that
lesser
men
thought
the
time
had
come
for
legal
looting
those
loyalists
who
best
understood
the
temper
of
their
late
left
at
once
they
were
right
even
to
be
a
woman
was
no
protection
against
confiscation
in
the
case
of
mary
phillips
to
beverley
robinson
a
loyalist
who
settled
in
new
brunswick
after
the
revolution
her
case
was
not
nearly
so
hard
as
many
another
but
her
historic
makes
it
the
most
romantic
years
before
this
general
braddock
had
marched
to
death
and
defeat
beside
the
monongahela
with
two
handsome
and
gallant
young
washington
and
morris
both
fell
in
love
with
bewitching
mary
phillips
but
while
washington
left
her
morris
won
her
heart
and
hand
now
that
the
strife
was
no
longer
against
a
foreign
foe
but
between
two
british
parties
the
former
found
themselves
rivals
in
arms
as
well
as
love
for
colonel
morris
was
man
in
all
that
concerned
the
loyalists
being
the
official
head
of
the
department
of
claims
and
succour
morris
morgan
and
carleton
were
the
three
busiest
men
in
new
york
forty
thick
manuscript
volumes
still
show
maurice
morgan
assiduous
work
as
carleton
confidential
secretary
but
morris
had
the
more
duty
of
the
three
with
no
relief
day
after
day
from
the
anguishing
appeals
of
loyalist
widows
orphans
and
other
ruined
refugees
no
sooner
had
the
dire
news
arrived
that
peace
had
been
made
with
the
congress
and
that
each
of
the
thirteen
united
states
was
free
to
show
uncovenanted
mercies
towards
its
own
loyalists
than
the
exodus
began
five
thousand
five
hundred
and
loyalists
sailed
for
halifax
in
the
first
convoy
on
the
of
april
with
a
strong
recommendation
from
carleton
to
governor
parr
of
nova
scotia
of
these
are
of
the
first
families
and
born
to
the
fairest
possessions
i
therefore
beg
that
you
will
have
them
properly
considered
shipping
was
scarce
for
the
hostility
of
the
whole
foreign
naval
world
had
made
enormous
demands
on
the
british
navy
and
mercantile
marine
so
six
thousand
loyalists
had
to
march
overland
to
join
carleton
vessels
at
new
york
some
of
them
from
as
far
south
as
charlottesville
virginia
they
were
carefully
shepherded
by
colonel
alured
clarke
of
whom
we
shall
hear
again
meanwhile
carleton
and
washington
had
exchanged
the
usual
compliments
on
the
conclusion
of
peace
and
had
met
each
other
on
the
of
may
at
tappan
where
they
discussed
the
exchange
of
prisoners
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty
the
british
were
to
evacuate
new
york
their
last
foothold
in
the
new
republic
with
all
practicable
dispatch
so
as
summer
changed
into
autumn
the
congress
became
more
and
more
impatient
to
see
the
last
of
them
but
carleton
would
not
go
without
the
loyalists
whose
many
tributary
streams
of
misery
were
still
flowing
into
new
york
in
september
when
the
treaty
of
peace
was
ratified
in
europe
the
congress
asked
carleton
to
name
the
date
of
his
own
departure
but
he
replied
that
this
was
impossible
and
that
the
more
the
loyalists
were
persecuted
the
longer
he
would
be
obliged
to
stay
the
correspondence
between
him
and
the
congress
teems
with
complaints
and
explanations
the
americans
were
very
anxious
lest
the
loyalists
should
take
away
any
goods
and
chattels
not
their
own
particularly
slaves
carleton
was
disposed
to
consider
slaves
as
human
beings
though
slavery
was
still
the
law
in
the
british
oversea
dominions
and
so
the
americans
felt
uneasy
lest
he
might
discriminate
between
their
slaves
and
other
chattels
reams
of
the
carleton
papers
are
covered
with
descriptive
lists
of
claimed
and
niggers
julius
caesars
jupiters
venuses
dianas
and
so
on
who
were
either
wenches
and
fellows
or
and
perhaps
when
a
slave
wished
to
remain
british
and
his
case
was
nicely
balanced
between
the
claimants
and
the
carleton
was
a
little
inclined
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
but
with
other
forms
of
disputed
property
he
was
too
severe
to
please
all
loyalists
a
typical
case
of
restitution
in
canada
will
show
how
differently
the
two
governments
viewed
the
rights
of
private
property
mercier
and
halsted
two
quebec
rebels
owned
a
wharf
and
the
frame
of
a
warehouse
in
it
was
arnold
intercepted
letter
to
mercier
that
gave
carleton
lieutenant
cramahe
the
first
warning
of
danger
from
the
south
halsted
was
major
caldwell
miller
at
the
time
and
took
advantage
of
his
position
to
give
his
employer
flour
to
arnold
army
in
which
he
served
as
commissary
throughout
the
siege
just
after
the
peace
of
mercier
and
halsted
laid
claim
to
their
former
property
which
they
had
abandoned
for
eight
years
and
on
which
the
government
had
meanwhile
built
a
provision
store
making
use
of
the
original
frame
the
case
was
complicated
by
many
details
too
long
for
notice
here
but
the
british
government
finally
gave
the
two
rebels
the
original
property
plus
thirteen
years
rent
less
the
cost
of
government
works
erected
in
the
meantime
all
the
documents
are
still
in
quebec
property
was
troublesome
enough
but
people
were
worse
and
carleton
difficulties
increased
as
the
autumn
wore
on
the
first
great
harrying
of
the
loyalists
drove
more
than
thirty
thousand
from
their
homes
and
about
thousand
of
these
embarked
at
new
york
then
there
were
the
remnants
of
twenty
loyalist
corps
to
pension
settle
or
employ
there
were
also
the
british
prisoners
to
receive
besides
ten
thousand
german
mercenaries
add
to
all
this
the
regular
garrison
and
the
general
oversight
of
every
british
interest
in
north
america
from
the
floridas
to
labrador
remember
the
implacable
enemy
in
front
and
we
may
faintly
imagine
what
carleton
had
to
do
before
he
could
report
that
majesty
troops
and
such
remaining
loyalists
as
chose
to
emigrate
were
successfully
withdrawn
on
the
of
november
without
the
smallest
circumstance
of
irregularity
thus
ended
one
of
the
greatest
acts
in
the
drama
of
the
british
empire
the
peoples
or
the
world
and
thus
for
the
second
time
carleton
now
in
his
sixtieth
year
apparently
ended
his
own
long
service
in
america
he
had
left
canada
after
saving
her
from
obliteration
because
so
long
as
he
remained
her
governor
the
war
minister
at
home
remained
her
enemy
he
had
then
returned
to
serve
in
new
york
and
had
stayed
there
to
the
bitter
end
because
there
was
no
other
man
whom
the
new
government
would
trust
to
command
the
rearguard
of
the
empire

chapter

founding
modern
canada
carleton
now
enjoyed
two
years
of
uninterrupted
peace
at
his
country
seat
in
england
his
active
career
seemed
to
have
closed
at
last
he
had
no
taste
for
party
politics
he
was
not
anxious
to
fill
any
position
of
civil
or
military
trust
even
if
it
had
been
pressed
upon
him
and
he
had
said
farewell
to
america
for
good
and
all
when
he
had
left
new
york
though
as
full
of
public
spirit
as
before
and
only
just
turned
sixty
he
bid
fair
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
as
an
english
country
gentleman
his
young
wife
was
well
contented
with
her
lot
his
manly
boys
promised
to
become
worthy
followers
of
the
noble
profession
of
arms
and
the
overseeing
of
his
little
estate
occupied
his
time
very
pleasantly
indeed
like
most
healthy
englishmen
he
was
devoted
to
horses
and
unlike
some
others
he
was
very
successful
with
his
thoroughbreds
he
had
first
bought
a
place
near
maidenhead
beside
the
thames
which
is
nowhere
lovelier
than
in
that
sylvan
neighbourhood
then
he
bought
the
present
family
seat
of
greywill
hill
near
the
little
village
of
odiham
in
hampshire
as
an
and
a
county
magnate
a
personage
of
great
importance
to
the
empire
and
the
one
victorious
british
general
in
the
unhappy
american
war
he
had
more
than
earned
a
peerage
but
it
was
not
till
on
the
eve
of
his
birthday
and
at
a
time
when
his
services
were
urgently
required
again
that
he
received
it
needless
to
say
this
peerage
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
his
acceptance
of
another
duty
it
was
not
given
till
several
months
after
he
had
promised
to
return
to
canada
and
he
would
certainly
have
refused
it
if
it
had
been
held
out
to
him
as
an
inducement
to
go
there
he
became
baron
dorchester
and
was
granted
the
not
very
extravagant
addition
to
his
income
of
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
payable
during
four
lives
his
own
his
wife
and
those
of
his
two
eldest
sons
his
elevation
to
the
house
of
lords
met
with
the
almost
unanimous
approval
of
his
in
marked
contrast
to
the
open
hostility
they
had
shown
towards
his
old
enemy
lord
george
germain
when
that
vile
wrecker
had
been
upstairs
among
them
the
carleton
motto
crest
and
supporters
are
all
most
appropriate
the
crest
is
a
strong
right
arm
with
the

clenched
firmly
on

arrow
the
motto
is
his
vicimus

the
supporters
are
two
beavers

canada
while
their
respective
collars
one
a
naval
the
other
a
military
coronet
show
how
her
british
life
was
won
and
saved
and
has
been
kept
carleton
was
a
man
of
great
reserve
and
but
his
kindly
nature
must
have
responded
to
the
cordial
welcome
which
he
received
on
his
return
to
quebec
in
october
it
was
not
without
reason
that
the
people
of
canada
rejoiced
to
have
him
back
as
their
leader
all
that
the
indians
imagined
the
great
white
father
to
be
towards
themselves
he
was
in
reality
towards
both
red
man
and
white
stern
when
the
occasion
forced
him
to
be
stern
just
in
all
his
dealings
between
man
and
man
dignified
and
courteous
in
all
his
ways
a
soldier
through
every
inch
of
his
stalwart
six
feet
he
was
a
ruler
with
whom
no
one
ever
dreamt
of
taking
liberties
but
neither
did
any
deserving
one
in
trouble
ever
hesitate
to
lay
the
most
confidential
case
before
him
in
the
full
assurance
that
his
head
and
heart
were
at
the
service
of
all
committed
to
his
care
and
no
other
governor
before
his
time
or
since
ever
inspired
his
followers
with
such
a
firm
belief
that
all
would
turn
out
for
the
best
so
long
as
he
was
in
command
this
power
of
inspiring
confidence
was
now
badly
needed
everything
in
canada
was
still
provisional
owing
to
the
war
the
quebec
act
of
had
never
been
thoroughly
enforced
then
when
the
war
was
over
the
loyalists
arrived
and
completely
changed
the
circumstances
which
the
act
had
been
designed
to
meet
the
next
constitution
the
canada
act
of
was
of
a
very
different
character
during
the
seventeen
years
between
these
two
constitutions
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
make
the
best
of
a
very
confusing
state
of
flux
not
that
the
quebec
act
was
a
dead
letter
far
from
it
but
simply
that
it
could
not
go
beyond
restoring
the
privileges
of
the
priests
and
seigneurs
within
the
area
then
effectively
occupied
by
the
race
carleton
as
we
have
seen
had
faced
its
problem
for
the
first
four
years
haldimand
had
carried
on
the
government
under
its
provisions
for
the
following
six
hamilton
and
hope
successive
had
bridged
the
two
years
between
haldimand
retirement
and
carleton
second
appointment
now
carleton
was
to
pick
up
the
threads
and
make
what
he
could
of
the
tangled
skein
for
the
next
five
years
haldimand
had
not
been
popular
with
either
of
the
two
chief
parties
into
which
the
leading
french
canadians
were
divided
the
seigneurs
had
nothing
like
the
same
regard
for
a
swiss
soldier
of
fortune
that
they
had
for
aristocratic
british
commanders
like
murray
and
carleton
the
clergy
also
preferred
these
anglicans
to
such
a
strong
swiss
protestant
the
habitants
and
agitators
who
were
far
less
favourable
to
the
new
regime
had
passionately
resented
haldimand
firmness
at
times
of
crisis
but
despite
all
this
animus
he
was
not
such
an
absolute
martinet
as
some
writers
would
have
us
think
the
war
with
france
and
with
the
american
revolutionists
required
strong
government
in
canada
while
the
influx
of
loyalists
had
introduced
an
entirely
new
set
of
most
perplexing
circumstances
on
the
whole
haldimand
had
done
very
well
in
spite
of
many
personal
and
public
drawbacks
and
it
was
through
no
special
fault
of
his
nor
yet
of
hope
that
the
threads
which
carleton
picked
up
formed
such
a
perversely
tangled
skein
the
troubles
that
now
dogged
the
great
every
step
were
of
all
kinds
racial
religious
social
political
military
diplomatic
legal
the
confusion
resulting
from
the
intermixture
of
french
and
english
civil
laws
had
become
a
great
deal
more
confounded
since
he
had
left
canada
eight
years
before
the
old
proportions
of
races
and
religions
to
each
other
had
changed
most
disturbingly
the
loyalists
were
of
quite
a
different
social
class
from
the
immigrants
of
earlier
days
they
wanted
a
parliament
public
schools
and
many
other
things
new
to
the
country
and
they
were
the
sort
of
people
who
had
a
right
to
have
them
the
problem
of
defence
was
always
a
vexed
one
with
the
inadequate
military
forces
at
hand
and
the
insuperable
difficulties
concerning
the
militia
the
british
still
held
the
western
forts
pending
the
settlement
of
the
frontier
and
the
execution
of
the
treaty
of
peace
in
full
this
naturally
annoyed
the
american
government
and
gave
carleton
endless
trouble
but
more
serious
still
was
the
ceaseless
western
march
of
the
american
backwoodsmen
who
were
everywhere
in
conflict
with
the
indians
the
indians
in
their
turn
were
confused
between
the
british
and
americans
under
the
new
conditions
they
and
their
rights
and
territories
had
not
been
mentioned
in
the
treaty
but
seeing
that
they
would
be
better
off
under
british
than
under
american
rule
they
were
inclined
to
take
sides
accordingly
there
were
now
no
openly
hostile
sides
to
take
but
for
all
that
the
british
posts
in
the
hinterland
looked
like
weak
little
islands
which
might
be
suddenly
engulfed
in
the
sea
of
indian
troubles
raging
round
them
then
at
the
other
end
of
the
british
line
there
were
the
three
maritime
provinces
to
watch
over
new
brunswick
had
been
divided
off
from
nova
scotia
and
prince
edward
island
had
been
taken
from
the
direct
supervision
of
the
home
authorities
and
placed
under
the
command
of
the
new
governor
at
quebec
thus
carleton
had
to
deal
directly
with
everything
that
happened
from
the
far
west
to
gaspe
while
dealing
indirectly
with
the
three
maritime
provinces
and
all
the
troubles
that
proved
too
much
for
their
own
there
was
no
chance
of
concentrating
on
one
thing
at
a
time
nothing
would
wait
the
governor
had
to
watch
the
writhing
tangle
as
a
whole
during
every
minute
he
devoted
to
any
one
kinked
and
knotted
thread
fortunately
there
were
some
good
men
in
office
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
lords
sydney
and
grenville
the
two
cabinet
ministers
with
whom
carleton
had
most
to
do
were
both
sensible
and
sympathetic
years
afterwards
grenville
the
favourite
cousin
of
pitt
became
the
colleague
of
fox
at
the
head
of
the
celebrated
of
all
the
talents
hope
was
an
acceptable
and
his
successor
sir
alured
clarke
was
better
still
francois
bailly
the
coadjutor
roman
catholic
bishop
of
quebec
who
had
gone
to
england
as
french
tutor
to
carleton
children
was
a
most
enlightened
cleric
so
too
was
charles
inglis
the
anglican
bishop
of
nova
scotia
appointed
in
he
was
the
first
canadian
bishop
of
the
anglican
communion
and
his
diocese
comprised
the
whole
of
british
north
america
william
smith
the
new
chief
justice
was
as
different
from
carleton
last
chief
justice
livius
as
angels
are
from
devils
smith
had
been
an
excellent
chief
justice
of
his
native
new
york
in
the
old
colonial
days
and
like
inglis
was
a
very
ardent
loyalist
he
respected
all
reasonable
peculiarities
but
he
favoured
the
way
of
down
from
precedent
to
precedent
rather
than
the
french
way
of
referring
to
a
supposedly
infallible
written
regulation
we
shall
soon
meet
him
as
a
statesman
but
he
well
deserves
an
honoured
place
in
canadian
history
for
his
legal
services
alone
to
him
more
than
to
any
other
man
is
due
the
nicely
balanced
adjustments
which
eventually
harmonized
the
french
and
english
codes
into
a
body
of
laws
adapted
to
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
the
province
of
quebec
besides
the
committee
on
laws
carleton
had
nominated
three
other
active
committees
of
his
council
one
on
police
another
on
education
and
a
third
on
trade
and
commerce
the
police
committee
was
of
the
usual
kind
and
dealt
with
usual
problems
in
the
usual
way
but
the
education
committee
brought
out
all
the
vexed
questions
of
french
and
english
protestant
and
roman
catholic
progressive
and
reactionary
strangely
enough
the
sharpest
personal
controversy
was
that
between
hubert
the
roman
catholic
bishop
of
quebec
and
his
coadjutor
bailly
hubert
enumerated
all
the
institutions
already
engaged
in
educational
work
and
suggested
that
and
be
thankful
was
the
only
proper
attitude
for
the
committee
to
assume
but
bailly
very
neatly
pointed
out
that
his
respected
superior
real
opinions
could
not
be
those
attributed
to
him
over
his
own
signature
because
they
were
at
variance
with
the
facts
hubert
had
said
that
the
cures
were
spreading
education
with
most
commendable
zeal
had
repudiated
the
base
insinuation
that
only
three
or
four
people
in
each
parish
could
read
and
write
and
had
wound
up
by
thinking
that
while
there
was
so
much
land
to
clear
the
farmers
would
do
better
to
keep
their
sons
at
home
than
send
them
to
a
university
where
they
would
be
under
professors
so
as
to
have
no
definite
views
on
religion
bailly
argued
that
the
bishop
could
not
mean
what
these
words
seemed
to
imply
as
the
logical
conclusion
would
be
to
wait
till
canada
was
cleared
right
up
to
the
polar
circle
in
the
end
the
committee
made
three
very
sanguine
recommendations
a
free
common
school
in
every
parish
a
secondary
school
in
every
town
or
district
and
an
absolutely
central
university
this
educational
ladder
was
never
set
up
there
was
nothing
to
support
either
end
of
it
the
financial
side
was
one
difficulty
the
estates
were
intended
to
be
made
over
into
educational
endowments
under
government
control
but
amherst
claim
that
they
had
been
granted
to
him
in
was
not
settled
for
forty
years
and
by
that
time
all
chance
of
carrying
out
the
committee
intentions
was
seen
to
be
hopeless
commerce
was
another
burning
question
and
one
of
much
more
immediate
concern
in
the
united
populations
of
all
the
provinces
amounted
to
only
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
whom
at
least
were
french
canadians
quebec
and
montreal
had
barely
ten
thousand
citizens
apiece
but
the
commercial
classes
mostly
had
greatly
increased
in
numbers
ability
and
social
standing
the
gangs
of
twenty
years
before
had
now
either
disappeared
or
sunk
down
to
their
appropriate
level
so
petitions
from
the
merchants
required
and
received
much
more
consideration
than
formerly
the
loyalists
had
not
yet
had
time
to
start
in
business
all
their
energies
were
needed
in
hewing
out
their
future
homes
but
two
parts
of
the
american
republic
vermont
and
kentucky
were
very
anxious
to
do
business
with
the
british
at
any
reasonable
price
some
of
their
citizens
were
even
ready
for
a
change
of
allegiance
if
the
terms
were
only
good
enough
vermont
wanted
a
outlet
to
the
st
lawrence
by
way
of
the
richelieu
the
rapids
between
st
johns
and
chambly
lay
in
british
territory
but
vermont
was
ready
to
join
in
building
a
canal
and
would
even
become
british
to
make
sure
the
old
green
mountain
boys
had
changed
their
tune
ethan
allen
himself
had
buried
the
hatchet
and
like
his
brother
become
carleton
friendly
correspondent
he
frankly
explained
that
what
vermonters
really
wanted
was
not
liberty
and
added
that
they
would
stand
no
coercion
from
the
american
government
about
the
same
time
kentucky
was
bent
on
getting
an
equally
trade
outlet
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
by
way
of
the
mississippi
the
fact
that
france
spain
the
british
empire
and
the
united
states
might
all
be
involved
in
war
over
it
did
not
trouble
the
conspirators
in
the
least
the
central
authority
of
the
new
republic
was
still
weak
the
individual
states
were
still
ready
to
fly
asunder
federal
taxation
was
greatly
feared
anything
that
savoured
of
federal
interference
with
state
rights
was
passionately
resented
the
general
spirit
of
the
westerners
was
that
of
the
exploiting
pioneer
in
a
virgin
wilderness
a
law
unto
itself
alone
there
were
various
plans
for
opening
the
coveted
mississippi
one
was
to
join
spain
another
was
to
seize
new
orleans
turn
out
the
french
and
bring
in
the
british
then
to
make
the
plot
complete
the
french
minister
to
the
united
states
was
asking
permission
to
make
a
tour
through
canada
at
the
very
time
when
carleton
was
sending
home
reams
of
documents
bearing
on
the
impending
troubles
the
letters
exchanged
on
this
subject
are
perfect
models
of
politeness
but
carleton
answer
was
an
emphatic
no
foreign
complications
were
thickening
fast
the
french
revolution
had
already
begun
though
its
effect
was
not
yet
felt
in
canada
the
american
government
was
anxiously
watching
its
refractory
states
while
an
political
party
was
making
headway
in
the
south
as
if
this
was
not
enough
to
engage
whatever
attention
carleton
had
to
spare
from
the
internal
affairs
of
canada
he
suddenly
heard
that
the
spaniards
had
been
seizing
british
vessels
trading
to
a
british
post
on
vancouver
island
footnote
pioneers
of
the
pacific
in
this
series
this
nootka
affair
which
nearly
brought
on
a
war
with
spain
in
was
settled
in
london
and
madrid
but
the
threat
of
war
added
to
carleton
anxieties
meanwhile
the
governor
was
busily
employed
with
an
immigration
problem
it
was
desirable
that
the
immigrants
should
settle
on
the
land
with
the
least
possible
friction
between
them
and
the
french
canadians
the
french
canadians
differed
among
themselves
but
no
such
differences
brought
them
any
closer
to
their
new
neighbours
on
questions
of
land
settlement
the
french
had
granted
lands
in
seigneuries
the
british
would
hear
of
nothing
but
free
and
common
socage
french
farms
were
measured
by
the
arpent
and
were
staked
out
in
long
and
narrow
oblongs
british
farms
were
measured
by
the
acre
and
staked
out
the
square
language
laws
religion
manners
and
customs
ways
of
life
were
also
different
so
there
was
hardly
any
intermixture
of
settlements
the
french
canadians
remained
where
they
were
most
of
the
new
settled
in
the
maritime
provinces
or
moved
west
into
what
is
now
ontario
a
few
settled
in
rural
quebec
on
lands
outside
the
line
of
seigneuries
the
eastern
townships
that
part
of
the
province
lying
east
of
the
richelieu
and
nearest
the
american
frontier
absorbed
many
english
irish
and
scots
as
well
as
a
good
many
americans
who
were
attracted
by
cheap
land
ontario
or
upper
canada
received
still
more
americans
who
were
to
be
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
british
during
the
war
of
but
carleton
work
comprised
much
more
than
this
there
were
the
church
of
england
the
post
office
a
refractory
down
in
prince
edward
island
two
royal
visitors
and
many
other
distracting
matters
the
only
anglican
see
thus
far
established
was
at
halifax
but
the
bishop
there
had
authority
over
the
whole
country
and
the
government
intended
to
establish
the
church
of
england
in
canada
and
endow
it
the
presbyterians
also
petitioned
for
the
establishment
of
the
scottish
church
the
fortunes
or
misfortunes
of
the
clergy
reserves
belong
to
another
chapter
of
canadian
history
but
the
root
of
their
good
or
evil
was
planted
in
the
time
of
carleton
the
postal
service
was
surrounded
by
enormous
difficulties
the
vast
extent
of
wild
country
the
few
towns
the
long
winters
the
poverty
of
the
people
the
question
of
the
winter
port
was
even
then
a
live
one
between
st
john
and
halifax
each
of
these
towns
asserted
its
advantages
and
promised
twelve
trips
a
year
and
connection
with
quebec
overland
by
means
of
walking
postmen
till
a
bush
road
should
be
cut
from
quebec
to
the
sea
in
prince
edward
island
the
old
walter
patterson
declined
to
make
way
for
the
new
one
edmund
fanning
in
the
end
patterson
gave
up
the
contest
but
the
incident
trivial
as
it
now
appears
shows
what
a
had
to
face
in
the
early
days
when
each
province
had
queer
little
ways
of
its
own
patterson
had
no
precise
official
reason
but
he
said
he
could
not
go
home
to
answer
charges
he
did
not
understand
and
leave
an
island
which
had
been
his
very
successful
hobby
for
so
many
years
the
people
sided
with
him
so
vigorously
that
time
had
to
be
given
them
to
cool
down
before
the
transfer
could
be
peaceably
effected
a
judge
whose
court
is
in
perpetual
session
or
a
commander
whose
inadequate
forces
are
continually
surrounded
by
prospective
enemies
has
little
time
for
the
amenities
of
purely
social
life
so
carleton
generally
left
his
young
consort
to
rule
the
viceregal
court
at
the
chateau
st
louis
with
a
perfect
blend
of
london
and
versailles
two
princes
of
the
blood
however
demanded
more
than
the
usual
attention
from
the
governor
prince
william
henry

was
the
first
member
of
the
royal
family
to

when
he
arrived
in

he
was
the
proverbial
jolly
jack
tar
extremely
affable
to
everybody
and
he
quickly
won
golden
opinions
from
all
who
met
him
except
perhaps
from
lady
dorchester
and
sundry
partners
for
his
duty
dances
philippe
aubert
de
gaspe
and
other
privileged
chroniclers
record
with
slightly
shocked
delight
how
often
he
would
break
loose
from
lady
dorchester
designing
care
long
before
she
thought
it
right
for
him
to
do
so
and
his
partners
for
their
pretty
faces
instead
of
by
precedence
at
sorel
the
people
were
so
carried
away
by
their
enthusiasm
that
they
insisted
on
changing
the
name
of
their
little
town
to
william
henry
happily
this
name
never
took
root
in
public
sentiment
and
the
old
one
soon
came
back
to
stay
the
second
member
of
the
royal
family
to
come
to
canada
was
prince
edward
duke
of
kent
fourth
son
of
george
iii
father
of
queen
victoria
and
grandfather
of
prince
arthur
duke
of
connaught
who
became
the
first
royal
in
exactly
a
hundred
and
twenty
years
later
the
duke
of
kent
would
have
gladly
returned
to
quebec
as
and
the
people
would
have
gladly
welcomed
him
but
he
was
not
a
favourite
with
the
government
at
home
and
so
he
never
came
there
was
no
doubt
about
his
being
a
popular
favourite
in
quebec
during
the
three
years
he
spent
there
as
colonel
of
the
fusiliers
nor
has
he
been
forgotten
to
the
present
day
kent
house
is
still
the
name
of
his
quarters
in
the
town
as
well
as
of
his
country
residence
at
montmorency
falls
seven
miles
away
while
the
only
new
opening
ever
made
in
the
walls
is
called
kent
gate
the
duke
made
fast
friends
with
several
of
the
seigneurial
families
more
especially
with
the
de
salaberrys
whose
at
beauport
stood
between
montmorency
and
quebec
and
not
far
from
montcalm
headquarters
in
the
de
salaberrys
were
a
military
family
all
the
sons
went
into
the
army
and
one
became
the
hero
of
chateauguay
in
the
war
of
but
the
duke
mixed
freely
with
many
other
people
than
the
local
aristocracy
he
was
young
and
loved
adventure
as
was
proved
by
his
subsequent
gallantry
at
martinique
he
was
also
fond
of
driving
round
incognito
a
habit
which
on
at
least
one
occasion
obliged
him
to
put
his
skill
at
boxing
to
good
use
this
was
at
charlesbourg
a
village
near
quebec
where
he
was
watching
the
fun
at
the
first
election
ever
held
perhaps
from
a
meticulously
constitutional
point
of
view
the
scene
of
a
hotly
contested
election
was
not
quite
the
place
for
princes
of
the
blood
but
however
that
might
be
when
the
duke
saw
two
electors
pommelling
a
third
who
happened
to
be
a
friend
of
his
he
dashed
in
to
the
rescue
and
floored
both
of
them
with
a
neatly
planted
right
and
left
one
of
these
men
who
lived
to
see
king
edward
vii
arrive
in
as
prince
of
wales
always
took
the
greatest
pride
in
telling
successive
generations
of
voters
how
queen
victoria
father
had
knocked
him
down
like
his
brother
before
him
the
duke
was
very
fond
of
dancing
and
kept
many
a
reluctant
senior
and
many
a
chaperone
up
till
all
hours
at
the
grand
ball
given
in
honour
of
his
birthday
also
like
his
brother
he
was
inclined
to
reduce
his
duty
dances
to
a
minimum
much
to
lady
dorchester
dismay
she
had
gone
home
with
her
husband
for
two
years
shortly
after
the
duke
arrival
but
she
had
seen
enough
of
him
and
was
to
see
enough
again
on
her
return
to
make
her
regret
the
good
old
times
of
more
exacting
ceremony
to
her
dying
day
half
a
century
later
she
kept
up
a
prodigious
stateliness
of
manner
before
meals
she
expected
the
whole
company
to
assemble
and
remain
standing
till
she
had
made
her
royal
progress
through
the
room
she
was
a
living
anachronism
for
many
years
before
her
death
with
her
shoes
her
raised
high
above
her
head
and
interlaced
with
ribbons
her
elaborately
gorgeous
dress
her
intricate
array
of
ornaments
and
her
long
cane
but
she
was
no
anachronism
to
herself
for
she
still
lived
in
the
light
of
other
days
in
the
fondly
remembered
times
when
as
the
of
the
chateau
st
louis
she
helped
her
consort
to
settle
nice
points
of
etiquette
and
maintain
a
dignity
befitting
his
majesty
chosen
representative
how
did
the
seigneurs
rank
among
themselves
and
with
the
leading
people
who
were
to
dance
in
the
state
minuet
should
dancing
cease
when
the
bishops
came
in
and
for
how
long
was
that
curtsy
dropped
quite
low
enough
to
her
viceregal
self
and
did
that
offer
her
blushing
cheek
in
quite
the
proper
way
to
carleton
when
he
graciously
gave
her
the
presentation
kiss
how
immeasurably
far
away
it
all
seems
now
that
stately
little
court
where
the
echoes
of
a
dead
versailles
lived
on
for
seven
years
after
the
fall
of
the
bastille
and
yet
there
is
still
one
citizen
o
quebec
whose
early
partners
were
chaperoned
by
ladies
who
had
danced
the
minuet
with
lord
and
lady
dorchester
the
two
royal
visits
were
not
without
their
political
significance
using
the
word
political
in
its
larger
meaning
but
the
three
years
between
them
that
is
formed
the
really
pregnant
time
of
constitutional
development
when
the
canada
act
of
was
taking
shape
in
the
minds
of
its
chief
authors
carleton
and
smith
in
canada
grenville
and
pitt
in
england
the
loyalists
and
the
merchants
of
quebec
and
montreal
took
good
care
to
make
themselves
heard
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings
most
french
canadians
would
have
preferred
to
be
left
without
the
suspected
blessings
of
a
parliament
the
clergy
and
seigneurs
wished
for
a
continuance
of
the
quebec
act
and
the
habitants
wanted
they
knew
not
what
provided
it
would
enable
them
to
get
more
and
give
less
the
people
on
the
other
hand
were
all
for
a
parliament
but
they
differed
widely
as
to
what
kind
of
parliament
would
suit
their
purpose
best
as
a
rule
they
acquiesced
with
a
more
or
less
bad
grace
in
the
necessity
of
admitting
french
canadians
on
the
same
terms
as
themselves
if
canada
without
the
maritime
provinces
should
be
taken
as
a
whole
then
the
french
canadians
would
only
be
in
a
moderate
majority
if
however
two
provinces
upper
canada
and
lower
canada
were
to
be
erected
then
the
minority
in
lower
canada
would
be
outvoted
three
or
four
to
one
there
was
a
third
alternative
no
less
than
the
establishment
of
a
regular
dominion
of
british
north
america
in
a
step
which
might
have
saved
much
trouble
between
that
time
and
the
confederation
of
william
smith
was
its
strongest
advocate
carleton
its
most
cautious
and
judicious
supporter
the
chief
justice
was
in
favour
of
federating
upper
and
lower
canada
with
the
maritime
provinces
and
newfoundland
into
a
single
dominion
each
of
the
six
provinces
would
have
its
own
parliament
under
a
while
there
would
also
be
a
central
parliament
under
a
carleton
forwarded
the
suggestion
to
the
home
government
but
he
nowhere
committed
himself
to
any
very
definite
scheme
his
own
preference
was
for
keeping
the
existing
province
of
quebec
a
little
longer
then
dividing
it
and
afterwards
drawing
in
the
other
provinces
the
chief
justice
preferred
to
make
a
constitution
the
governor
preferred
to
let
it
grow
the
home
government
preference
could
not
be
stated
better
than
in
grenville
dispatch
to
carleton
of
the
of
october
general
object
is
to
assimilate
the
constitution
to
that
of
great
britain
as
nearly
as
the
difference
arising
from
the
manners
of
the
people
and
from
the
present
situation
of
the
province
will
admit
attention
is
due
to
the
prejudices
and
habits
of
the
french
inhabitants
and
every
caution
should
be
used
to
continue
to
them
the
enjoyment
of
those
civil
and
religious
rights
which
were
secured
to
them
by
the
capitulation
or
which
have
since
been
granted
by
the
liberal
and
enlightened
spirit
of
the
british
government
except
for
its
rather
too
conclusion
this
confidential
announcement
really
is
an
admirable
statement
of
the
and
enlightened
views
which
prevailed
at
westminster
the
bill
postponed
in
was
introduced
by
pitt
himself
in
the
house
of
commons
on
the
of
march
sixteen
days
later
adam
lymburner
a
representative
merchant
of
quebec
whom
carleton
described
as
quiet
decent
man
not
unfriendly
to
the
administration
pleaded
for
hours
before
the
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
against
the
division
of
the
province
all
the
minority
in
the
prospective
province
of
lower
canada
were
afraid
of
being
swamped
by
the
vote
and
so
of
being
hampered
in
liberty
and
trade
the
london
merchants
naturally
backed
lymburner
fox
opposed
the
bill
as
not
being
liberal
enough
burke
flared
up
into
the
speech
which
led
to
his
final
breach
with
fox
pitt
the
pilot
who
was
to
weather
far
greater
storms
in
the
years
to
come
eventually
got
the
bill
through
both
houses
with
substantial
majorities
on
the
of
may
it
became
law
quebec
and
ontario
were
parted
for
good
notwithstanding
the
legislative
union
of
fifty
years
later
the
canada
act
or
as
it
is
better
known
the
constitutional
act
cut
off
upper
canada
lower
canada
was
now
the
old
quebec
reduced
to
its
right
size
endowed
with
clarified
laws
and
a
parliament
and
made
as
acceptable
as
possible
to
the
minority
without
any
injustice
to
the
vastly
greater
french
majority
quebec
three
rivers
montreal
and
sorel
got
each
two
members
in
the
new
parliament
an
allotment
which
ensured
a
certain
representation
of
the
merchants
the
franchise
was
the
same
in
both
provinces
in
the
country
parts
a
freehold
or
its
equivalent
and
in
the
towns
either
a
annual
ownership
value
or
twice
that
for
a
tenant
the
crown
gave
up
all
taxation
except
commercial
duties
which
were
to
be
applied
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
provinces
lands
outside
the
seigneuries
were
to
be
in
free
and
common
socage
while
seigneurial
tenure
itself
could
be
converted
into
freehold
on
petition
of
the
crown
lands
was
reserved
for
the
endowment
of
the
church
of
england
the
crown
kept
all
rights
of
veto
and
appointment
the
legislatures
were
small
in
membership
the
upper
houses
could
be
made
hereditary
though
the
actual
tenure
was
never
more
than
for
life
during
good
behaviour
carleton
favoured
the
hereditary
principle
whenever
it
could
be
applied
with
advantage
but
he
knew
the
ups
and
downs
of
colonial
fortunes
too
well
to
believe
that
canada
was
ready
for
any
such
experiment
no
one
dreamt
of
having
what
is
now
known
as
responsible
government
that
is
an
executive
sitting
in
the
legislature
and
responsible
to
the
legislature
for
its
acts
nor
was
the
greatest
of
all
parliamentary
powers
the
power
of
the
purse
given
outright
this
however
was
owing
to
simple
force
of
circumstances
and
not
to
any
desire
of
abridging
the
liberties
of
the
people
the
fact
is
that
at
this
time
eighty
per
cent
of
the
total
civil
expenditure
had
to
be
paid
by
the
home
government
it
is
frequently
ignored
that
the
mother
country
paid
most
of
bills
till
long
after
the
war
of
that
she
paid
nearly
all
the
naval
and
military
accounts
for
longer
still
and
that
she
has
borne
far
more
than
her
own
share
of
the
common
defence
down
to
the
present
day
the
new
constitution
came
into
force
on
the
of
december
and
for
the
first
time
upper
and
lower
canada
had
the
right
to
elect
their
own
representatives
assemblies
of
course
were
nothing
new
in
british
north
america
nova
scotia
had
an
assembly
in
the
year
that
louisbourg
was
taken
prince
edward
island
had
one
in
the
year
before
the
quebec
act
was
passed
new
brunswick
had
one
in
the
year
carleton
began
his
second
term
but
assemblies
still
had
all
the
charm
of
novelty
in
proper
perhaps
it
would
be
more
appropriate
to
say
that
upper
canada
experienced
more
charm
than
novelty
while
lower
canada
experienced
more
novelty
than
charm
the
in
all
five
provinces
were
used
to
parliaments
in
america
their
ancestors
had
been
used
to
them
for
centuries
in
england
so
the
little
parliament
of
upper
canada
at
newark
passed
as
many
bills
in
five
weeks
as
that
of
lower
canada
passed
in
seven
months
the
fact
that
there
were
fifty
members
in
the
assembly
at
quebec
while
there
were
only
half
as
many
in
both
chambers
at
newark
doubtless
had
something
to
do
with
it
but
the
fact
that
the
quebec
parliament
was
an
innovation
while
the
one
at
newark
was
a
simple
development
had
very
much
more
there
is
no
need
to
follow
the
course
of
legislation
in
any
of
the
five
provinces
as
most
of
the
civil
and
practically
all
the
naval
and
military
expenditure
had
to
be
met
by
the
imperial
treasury
and
as
canada
was
five
parts
and
no
whole
from
her
own
parliamentary
point
of
view
the
legislation
required
for
a
grand
total
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
people
could
not
be
of
the
national
kind
but
at
quebec
the
scene
the
setting
and
the
innovation
itself
all
give
a
special
interest
to
every
detail
of
the
opening
ceremony
on
the
of
december
carleton
was
in
england
so
the
speech
from
the
throne
was
read
by
the
sir
alured
clarke
half
of
the
upper
house
and
of
the
lower
were
french
canadians
a
member
was
nominated
for
the
speakership
and
elected
unanimously
both
races
were
for
the
most
part
represented
by
members
whose
official
title
of
gentlemen
was
not
at
all
a
misnomer
the
french
members
of
the
assembly
were
half
distrustful
both
of
it
and
of
themselves
but
they
knew
how
to
add
grace
and
dignity
to
a
very
notable
occasion
the
old
bishop
palace
served
as
the
houses
of
parliament
and
so
continued
for
many
years
to
come
it
was
a
solid
rather
than
a
stately
pile
but
it
stood
on
a
commanding
site
at
the
head
of
mountain
hill
between
the
grand
battery
and
the
chateau
st
louis
every
one
was
in
uniform
or
in
what
corresponded
to
court
dress
round
the
throne
stood
many
officers
in
their
red
and
gold
conspicuous
among
them
the
duke
of
kent
in
front
sat
the
executive
and
legislative
councillors
corresponding
to
the
modern
cabinet
ministers
and
senators
their
roll
as
well
as
the
assembly
bore
many
names
that
recalled
the
glories
of
the
old
regime
st
ours
longueuil
de
lanaudiere
boucherville
de
salaberry
de
lotbiniere
and
many
more
the
council
chamber
was
crowded
in
every
part
long
before
the
governor
arrived
ladies
introduced
into
the
house
were
hat
cloak
or
bonnet
the
of
his
majesty
council
having
taken
good
care
to
see
them
the
same
in
the
great
committee
room
previous
to
their
introduction
ladies
attached
to
his
excellency
suite
were
admitted
the
railing
or
body
of
the
house
and
with
the
seats
of
the
members
as
far
as
possible
outwardly
it
was
all
very
much
the
same
in
principle
as
the
opening
of
any
other
british
parliament
the
escort
guard
and
band
the
royal
salute
the
brilliant
staff
the
scarlet
cloth
of
state
the
few
and
quiet
members
of
the
upper
house
the
many
of
the
lower
jostling
each
other
to
get
a
good
place
near
mr
speaker
at
the
bar
the
radiant
ladies
the
crowded
galleries
corniced
with
inquiring
faces
and
craned
necks
the
gentlemen
ushers
and
their
quaint
bows
the
speech
from
the
throne
and
the
occasional
lifting
of
his
excellency
hat
the
retiring
in
full
state
and
then
the
ebbing
away
of
all
the
sightseers
their
eddying
currents
of
packed
humanity
in
the
halls
and
passages
the
porch
the
door
the
emptying
street
but
inwardly
what
a
world
of
difference
for
here
was
the
first
british
parliament
in
which
legislators
of
foreign
birth
and
blood
and
language
were
shaping
british
laws
as
british
subjects
in
september
carleton
returned
from
his
two
absence
and
was
welcomed
more
warmly
than
ever
quebec
blazed
with
illuminations
the
streets
swarmed
with
eager
crowds
the
first
session
of
the
first
parliament
had
been
better
than
any
one
had
dared
to
hope
for
there
was
a
general
tendency
to
give
the
new
constitution
a
fair
trial
and
all
classes
looked
to
carleton
to
make
the
harmony
that
had
been
attained
both
permanent
and
universal
dr
jacob
mountain
first
anglican
bishop
of
quebec
also
arrived
shortly
afterwards
and
was
warmly
greeted
by
the
roman
catholic
prelate
who
embraced
him
saying
time
you
came
to
shepherd
your
own
flock
mountain
was
statesman
and
churchman
in
one
he
had
been
chosen
by
the
elder
pitt
to
be
the
younger
tutor
and
then
chosen
by
the
younger
to
be
his
private
secretary
the
fact
that
the
anglican
bishop
of
quebec
was
then
and
for
many
years
afterwards
a
sort
of
canadian
to
the
imperial
troops
and
that
most
of
the
leading
officials
and
leading
loyalists
belonged
to
the
church
of
england
made
him
a
personage
of
great
importance
it
was
fortunate
that
as
in
the
case
of
inglis
down
in
halifax
the
choice
could
not
have
fallen
on
a
better
man
or
on
one
who
knew
better
how
to
win
the
esteem
of
communions
other
than
his
own
this
same
year
died
william
smith
full
of
honours
but
the
next
year
his
excellent
successor
arrived
in
the
person
of
william
osgoode
the
new
chief
justice
an
eminent
english
lawyer
who
had
served
for
two
years
as
chief
justice
of
upper
canada
and
whose
name
is
commemorated
in
osgoode
hall
toronto
he
had
come
out
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
no
fees
were
to
be
attached
to
his
office
only
a
definite
salary
this
was
a
great
triumph
for
carleton
who
certainly
practised
what
he
preached
so
far
so
good
but
the
third
conspicuous
new
arrival
john
graves
simcoe
of
upper
canada
who
had
come
out
the
year
before
was
a
great
deal
less
to
carleton
liking
simcoe
was
a
good
officer
who
threw
himself
heart
and
soul
into
the
work
of
settling
the
new
province
he
won
the
affectionate
regard
of
his
people
and
is
gratefully
remembered
by
their
posterity
but
he
was
too
exclusively
of
his
own
province
in
his
civil
and
military
outlook
and
was
disposed
to
ignore
carleton
as
his
official
chief
moreover
he
was
appointed
in
spite
of
carleton
strongly
expressed
preference
for
sir
john
johnson
who
to
all
appearances
was
the
very
man
for
the
post
sir
william
johnson
the
first
baronet
had
been
the
great
british
leader
of
the
indians
and
a
person
of
much
consequence
throughout
america
his
son
john
inherited
many
of
his
good
qualities
thoroughly
understood
the
west
and
its
problems
was
a
devoted
loyalist
all
through
the
revolution
when
he
raised
the
king
royal
regiment
of
new
york
and
would
have
been
second
only
to
carleton
himself
in
the
eyes
of
all
canadians
old
and
new
but
the
government
thought
his
private
interests
too
great
for
his
public
duty
an
excellent
general
principle
though
misapplied
in
this
particular
case
at
any
rate
simcoe
came
instead
and
the
friction
began
at
once
simcoe
commission
clearly
made
him
subordinate
to
carleton
yet
simcoe
made
appointments
without
consulting
his
superior
and
argued
the
point
after
he
had
been
brought
to
book
he
communicated
directly
with
the
home
government
over
his
superior
head
and
was
not
rebuked
by
the
minister
to
whom
he
wrote
henry
dundas
afterwards
first
viscount
melville
dundas
indeed
was
half
inclined
to
snub
carleton
simcoe
desired
to
establish
military
posts
wherever
he
thought
they
would
best
promote
immediate
settlement
a
policy
which
would
tend
to
sap
both
the
government
resources
and
the
of
the
settlers
he
also
wished
to
fix
the
capital
at
london
instead
of
york
now
toronto
and
to
make
york
instead
of
kingston
the
naval
base
for
lake
ontario
thus
the
friction
continued
at
length
carleton
wrote
to
the
duke
of
portland
pitt
home
secretary
saying
command
civil
and
military
being
thus
disorganized
and
without
remedy
your
grace
will
i
hope
excuse
my
anxiety
for
the
arrival
of
any
successor
who
may
have
authority
sufficient
to
restore
order
lest
these
insubordinations
should
extend
to
mutiny
among
the
troops
and
sedition
among
the
people
that
was
in
november
the
government
however
took
no
decisive
action
and
next
year
both
carleton
and
simcoe
left
canada
for
ever
when
this
unfortunate
quarrel
began
canada
was
in
grave
danger
of
being
attacked
by
both
the
french
and
the
american
republics
the
danger
however
had
been
greatly
lessened
by
jay
treaty
of
and
was
to
be
still
further
lessened
by
the
transfer
of
the
western
posts
to
the
united
states
and
by
the
presidential
election
which
gave
the
federal
party
a
new
lease
of
power
though
no
longer
under
washington
had
carleton
remained
in
canada
these
felicitous
events
would
have
offered
him
a
unique
opportunity
of
strengthening
the
friendly
ties
between
the
british
and
the
americans
in
a
way
which
might
have
saved
some
trouble
later
on
but
that
was
not
to
be
to
understand
the
dangers
which
threatened
canada
during
the
last
three
years
of
carleton
rule
we
must
go
back
to
february
when
revolutionary
france
declared
war
on
england
and
there
then
began
that
titanic
struggle
which
only
ended
years
later
on
the
field
of
waterloo
the
americans
were
divided
into
two
parties
one
disposed
to
be
friendly
towards
great
britain
the
other
unfriendly
the
names
these
parties
then
bore
must
not
be
confused
with
those
borne
by
their
political
offspring
at
the
present
day
the
federals
progenitors
of
the
present
republicans
formed
the
friendly
party
under
washington
hamilton
and
jay
the
republicans
progenitors
of
the
present
democrats
formed
the
unfriendly
party
under
jefferson
madison
and
randolph
the
federals
were
in
power
the
republicans
in
opposition
when
the
republicans
got
into
power
in
under
jefferson
they
pursued
their
policy
till
they
finally
brought
on
the
war
of
under
the
presidency
of
madison
the
strength
of
the
peace
party
lay
in
the
north
that
of
the
war
party
lay
in
the
south
the
peaceful
federals
now
that
independence
had
been
gained
were
in
favour
of
meeting
the
amicable
british
government
when
pitt
came
into
power
in
he
at
once
held
out
the
olive
branch
now
ten
years
later
the
more
statesmen
on
both
sides
were
preparing
to
confirm
the
new
friendship
in
the
practical
form
of
jay
treaty
which
put
the
united
states
into
what
is
at
present
known
as
a
position
with
regard
to
british
trade
and
commerce
moreover
washington
and
his
northern
federals
much
preferred
a
british
canada
to
a
french
one
while
jefferson
and
the
southern
republicans
thought
any
stick
was
good
enough
to
beat
the
british
dog
with
the
jeffersonians
eagerly
seized
on
the
reports
of
a
speech
which
carleton
made
to
the
miamis
who
lived
just
south
of
detroit
and
used
it
to
the
utmost
as
a
means
of
stirring
up
feeling
carleton
had
said
are
witnesses
that
we
have
acted
in
the
most
peaceable
manner
and
borne
the
language
and
conduct
of
the
united
states
with
patience
but
i
believe
our
patience
is
almost
exhausted
applied
to
the
vexed
questions
of
the
western
posts
of
the
lawless
ways
of
the
exterminating
american
pioneers
and
of
the
infinitely
worse
jobbing
politicians
behind
them
this
language
was
mildness
itself
but
in
view
of
the
high
statesmanship
of
washington
and
his
government
it
was
injudicious
all
the
same
dundas
more
especially
because
he
was
a
cabinet
minister
was
even
more
injudicious
when
he
adopted
a
tone
of
reproof
towards
carleton
whose
great
services
past
and
present
entitled
him
to
unusual
respect
and
confidence
the
negotiations
for
jay
treaty
were
then
in
progress
in
london
and
jefferson
saw
his
chance
of
injuring
both
the
american
and
british
governments
by
magnifying
carleton
speech
into
an
outrage
he
also
hoped
that
an
indian
war
would
upset
the
treaty
and
bring
on
a
british
war
as
well
and
the
prospect
did
look
encouragingly
black
in
the
west
where
the
american
general
wayne
was
ready
waiting
south
of
lake
erie
while
the
trade
in
scalps
was
unusually
brisk
forty
dollars
was
the
regular
market
price
for
an
ordinary
indian
scalp
but
as
much
as
a
thousand
was
offered
for
simon
girty
in
the
hope
of
getting
that
inconvenient
british
scout
put
quickly
out
of
the
way
nearer
home
jefferson
and
his
band
of
demagogues
had
other
arguments
as
well
the
federal
north
would
suffer
most
by
war
while
the
republican
south
might
use
war
as
a
means
of
repudiating
all
the
debts
she
owed
to
englishmen
this
would
have
been
a
very
different
thing
from
the
insolvency
of
the
continental
congress
during
the
revolution
it
was
dire
want
not
financial
infamy
that
made
the
revolutionary
paper
money
worth
a
continental
but
it
would
have
been
sheer
theft
for
the
jeffersonian
south
to
have
made
its
honest
obligations
as
a
pennsylvanian
bond
the
wild
rage
that
swept
through
the
south
now
fanned
the
flame
and
made
the
sparks
fly
over
into
canada
in
april
a
fiery
red
republican
named
genet
landed
at
charleston
as
french
minister
to
the
united
states
and
made
a
triumphal
progress
to
philadelphia
nobody
bothered
about
the
fundamental
differences
between
the
french
and
american
revolutions
france
and
england
were
going
to
war
and
that
was
enough
genet
was
one
of
those
whom
revolutions
throw
into
ridiculous
power
when
he
began
his
campaign
the
republican
south
was
at
his
feet
planters
and
legislators
donned
caps
of
liberty
and
danced
themselves
so
crazy
over
the
rights
of
abstract
man
that
they
had
no
enthusiasm
left
for
such
concrete
instances
as
loyalists
englishmen
and
their
own
plantation
slaves
then
genet
made
his
next
step
in
the
new
diplomacy
by
fitting
out
french
privateers
in
american
harbours
and
seizing
british
vessels
in
american
waters
this
brought
washington
down
on
him
at
once
then
he
lost
his
head
completely
abused
everybody
including
jefferson
and
retired
from
public
life
as
an
american
citizen
being
afraid
to
go
home
genet
absurd
career
was
short
but
very
meteoric
while
it
lasted
and
full
of
his
agents
were
everywhere
and
his
successor
adet
carried
on
the
underground
agitation
with
equal
zeal
and
more
astuteness
vermont
offered
an
excellent
base
of
operations
finding
that
its
british
proclivities
had
not
produced
the
chambly
canal
for
its
trade
with
the
st
lawrence
it
had
become
more
violently
than
ever
before
and
even
proposed
taking
canada
this
time
its
new
policy
remained
at
fever
heat
for
over
three
years
and
only
cooled
down
when
a
british
captured
the
incongruously
named
in
which
ira
allen
was
trying
to
run
the
blockade
from
ostend
with
twenty
thousand
muskets
and
other
arms
which
he
represented
as
being
solely
for
the
annual
drill
of
the
vermont
militia
thus
carleton
had
to
watch
the
raging
south
the
dangerous
west
and
bellicose
vermont
all
together
besides
taking
whatever
measures
he
could
against
the
swarms
of
secret
enemies
within
the
gates
the
american
immigrants
who
wanted
not
liberty
were
ready
enough
for
a
change
of
flag
whenever
it
suited
them
but
they
were
few
compared
with
the
mass
of
french
canadians
who
were
being
stirred
into
disaffection
the
seigneurs
the
clergy
and
the
very
few
enlightened
people
of
other
classes
had
no
desire
for
being
conquered
by
a
regicide
france
or
an
obliterating
american
republic
but
many
of
the
habitants
and
of
the
uneducated
in
the
towns
lent
a
willing
ear
to
those
who
promised
them
all
kinds
of
liberty
and
property
put
together
the
danger
was
all
the
greater
because
it
was
no
longer
one
foreigner
intriguing
against
another
as
in
but
french
against
british
and
class
against
class
some
of
the
appeals
were
still
ridiculous
the
habitants
found
themselves
credited
with
an
unslakable
thirst
for
higher
education
they
were
promised
maritime
intercommunication
between
the
old
world
and
the
new
a
wonderful
extension
of
representative
institutions
and
much
more
to
the
same
effect
universal
revolutionary
brotherhood
included
but
when
frenchmen
came
promising
fleets
and
armies
when
these
emissaries
were
backed
by
french
canadians
who
had
left
home
for
good
reasons
after
the
troubles
of
and
when
the
habitants
were
positively
assured
by
all
these
credible
witnesses
that
france
and
the
united
states
were
going
to
drive
the
british
out
of
canada
and
make
a
heaven
on
earth
for
all
who
would
turn
against
carleton
then
there
really
was
something
that
sensible
men
could
believe
everything
for
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
only
turn
against
the
british
and
the
rest
would
be
easy
no
more
tithes
to
the
cures
no
more
seigneurial
dues
no
more
taxes
to
a
government
which
put
half
the
money
in
its
own
pocket
and
sent
the
other
half
to
the
king
who
spent
it
buying
palaces
and
crowns
is
too
absurd
for
them
to
believe
wrote
carleton
who
felt
all
the
old
troubles
of
coming
back
in
a
greatly
aggravated
form
he
lost
no
time
in
vain
regrets
however
but
got
a
militia
bill
through
parliament
improved
the
defences
of
quebec
and
issued
a
proclamation
enjoining
all
good
subjects
to
find
out
report
and
seize
every
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
an
attempt
to
embody
two
thousand
militiamen
by
ballot
was
a
dead
failure
the
few
militiamen
required
came
forward
alacrity
the
habitants
hung
back
or
broke
into
riotous
mobs
the
ordinary
habitant
could
hardly
be
blamed
he
saw
little
difference
between
one
kind
of
people
and
another
so
he
naturally
thought
it
best
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
prospective
winners
especially
when
they
persuaded
him
that
he
would
get
back
everything
taken
from
him
by
infamous
quebec
act
there
really
was
no
way
whatever
of
getting
him
to
see
the
truth
under
these
circumstances
the
mere
fact
that
his
condition
had
improved
so
much
under
british
rule
made
him
all
the
readier
to
cry
for
the
moon
things
presently
went
from
bad
to
worse
a
glowing
bombastic
address
from
free
french
to
their
canadian
brothers
who
of
course
were
was
even
read
out
at
more
than
one
church
door
then
the
quebec
assembly
unanimously
passed
an
alien
act
in
may
and
suspected
characters
began
to
find
that
two
could
play
at
the
game
this
stringent
act
was
not
passed
a
day
too
soon
by
its
provisions
the
habeas
corpus
act
could
be
suspended
or
suppressed
and
the
strongest
measures
taken
against
sedition
in
every
form
monk
the
reported
that
is
astonishing
to
find
the
same
savagery
exhibited
here
as
in
france
the
habitants
and
lower
class
of
townsfolk
had
beers
well
worked
up
follow
france
and
the
united
states
by
destroying
a
throne
which
was
the
seat
of
hypocrisy
imposture
despotism
greed
cruelty
and
all
the
other
deadly
sins
the
first
step
was
to
be
the
assassination
of
all
obnoxious
officials
and
leading
british
patriots
the
minute
the
promised
invasion
began
to
prove
successful
no
war
came
and
as
we
have
seen
already
last
year
was
more
peaceful
than
his
first
but
even
then
the
external
dangers
made
the
post
a
very
trying
one
especially
when
internal
troubles
were
equally
rife
thus
carleton
never
enjoyed
a
single
day
without
its
anxious
moments
till
old
and
growing
weary
though
devoted
as
ever
he
finally
left
quebec
on
the
of
july
this
was
the
second
occasion
on
which
he
had
been
forced
to
resign
by
unfair
treatment
at
the
hands
of
those
who
should
have
been
his
best
support
it
was
infinitely
worse
the
first
time
when
he
was
stabbed
in
the
back
by
that
shameless
political
assassin
lord
george
germain
but
the
second
was
also
inexcusable
because
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
as
to
which
of
the
incompatibles
should
have
left
his
post
the
replaceable
simcoe
or
the
irreplaceable
carleton
yet
as
rounded
point
levy
and
the
great
stronghold
of
quebec
faded
from
his
view
carleton
had
at
least
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
had
been
the
principal
saviour
of
one
british
canada
and
the
principal
founder
of
another
chapter
x
our
tale
is
told
the
was
wrecked
on
the
island
of
anticosti
where
the
estuary
of
the
st
lawrence
joins
the
gulf
no
lives
were
lost
and
the
carletons
reached
perce
in
gaspe
quite
safely
in
a
little
coasting
vessel
then
a
ship
came
round
from
halifax
and
sailed
the
family
over
to
england
at
the
end
of
september
just
thirty
years
after
carleton
had
come
out
to
canada
to
take
up
a
burden
of
oversea
governance
such
as
no
other
viceroy
in
any
part
of
the
british
empire
has
ever
borne
so
long
he
lived
to
become
a
wonderful
link
with
the
past
when
he
died
at
home
in
england
he
was
in
the
year
of
his
connection
with
the
army
and
in
the
of
his
age
more
than
any
other
man
of
note
he
brought
the
days
of
marlborough
into
touch
with
those
of
wellington
though
a
century
lay
between
at
the
time
he
received
his
first
commission
most
of
the
senior
officers
were
old
marlburians
at
the
time
of
his
death
nelson
had
already
won
trafalgar
napoleon
had
already
been
emperor
of
the
french
for
nearly
three
years
and
wellington
had
already
begun
the
great
peninsular
campaigns
own
life
thus
constitutes
a
most
remarkable
link
between
two
very
different
eras
of
imperial
history
but
he
and
his
wife
together
constitute
a
still
more
remarkable
link
between
two
eras
of
canadian
history
which
are
still
farther
apart
at
first
sight
it
seems
almost
impossible
that
he
who
was
the
trusted
friend
o
wolfe
and
she
who
learned
deportment
at
versailles
in
the
reign
of
louis
quinze
should
together
make
up
a
living
link
between
when
frontenac
saved
quebec
from
the
american
colonials
under
phips
and
when
the
new
dominion
was
proclaimed
there
but
it
is
true
carleton
born
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
eighteenth
century
knew
several
old
men
who
had
served
at
the
battle
of
the
boyne
which
was
fought
three
months
before
frontenac
sent
his
defiance
to
phips
the
mouth
of
my
cannon
carleton
wife
living
far
on
into
the
second
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
knew
several
rising
young
men
who
saw
the
dominion
of
canada
well
started
on
its
great
career
all
carleton
sons
went
into
the
army
and
all
died
on
active
service
the
fourth
was
killed
in
at
carrying
the
same
sword
that
carleton
himself
had
used
there
years
before
a
picture
of
the
first
siege
of
hangs
in
the
of
the
family
seat
at
greywell
hill
to
remind
successive
generations
of
their
martial
ancestors
but
no
carleton
needs
to
be
reminded
of
a
man
first

the
call
to
arms
the
present
holder
of
the
dorchester
estates
and
title
is
a
woman
but
her
son
and
heir
went
straight
to
the
front
with
the
cavalry
of
the
first
british
army
corps
to
take
the
field
in
belgium
during
the
great
world
war
of
carleton
spent
most
of
his
last
twelve
years
at
kempshot
near
basingstoke
because
he
kept
his
stud
there
and
horses
were
his
chief
delight
but
he
died
at
stubbings
his
place
near
maidenhead
beside
the
silver
thames
on
the
of
november
thus
after
an
unadventurous
youth
and
early
manhood
he
spent
his
long
maturity
steering
the
ship
of
state
through
troublous
seas
abroad
then
passed
life

in
the
quiet

leading
character
in
the
first
half
of
the
third
volume
of
and
its
which
being
the
work
of
different
authors
throws
light
on
his
character
from
several
different
british
points
of
view
as
well
as
from
several
different
kinds
of
evidence
kingsford

volumes

to

treats
the
period
in
considerable
detail
justin

two
volumes
struggle
for
the
fourteenth
is
the
work
of
a
most
painstaking
american
scholar
who
had
already
produced
an
excellent
account
of
march
from
cambridge
to
in
which
for
the
first
time
was
printed
word
for
word
expedition
to
by
codman
is
another
careful
work
these
are
the
complements
of
the
british
books
mentioned
above
as
they
emphasize
the
american
point
of
view
and
draw
more
from
american
than
from
british
sources
of
original
information
the
unfortunate
defect
of
struggle
for
the
fourteenth
is
that
the
author
efforts
to
be
sprightly
at
all
costs
tend
to
repel
the
serious
student
while
his
very
thoroughness
itself
repels
the
merely
casual
reader
so
many
absurd
or
perverting
mistakes
are
still
made
about
the
life
and
times
of
carleton
and
a
full
understanding
of
his
career
is
of
such
vital
importance
to
canadian
history
that
no
accounts
given
in
the
general
run
of
books
including
many
works
should
be
accepted
without
reference
to
the
original
authorities
justin
smith
books
cited
above
have
useful
lists
of
authorities
though
there
is
no
discrimination
between
documents
of
very
different
value
the
original
british
diaries
kept
during
montgomery
and
arnold
beleaguerment
have
been
published
by
the
literary
and
historical
society
of
quebec
in
two
volumes
at
the
end
of
which
there
is
a
very
useful
bibliography
showing
the
whereabouts
of
the
actual
manuscripts
of
these
and
many
other
documents
in
english
french
and
german
in
addition
to
the
american
and
british
diarists
who
wrote
in
english
there
were
several
prominent
french
canadians
and
german
officers
who
kept
most
interesting
journals
which
are
still
extant
the

archives
at
ottawa
possess
an
immense
mass
of
originals
facsimiles
and
verbatim
copies
of
every
kind
