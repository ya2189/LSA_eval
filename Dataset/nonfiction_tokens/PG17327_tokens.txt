both
the

two
figures

at

emerge
from

darkness
a
certain
irbarammân
and
an
whom
we
find
engaged
in
building
palaces
and
making
a
necropolis
they
were
followed
towards
by
a
of
whom
nothing
is
known
but
his
name
he
in
his
turn
was
succeeded
about
the
year
by
one
assurdân
who
appears
to
have
concentrated
his
energies
upon
public
works
for
we
hear
of
him
digging
a
canal
to
supply
his
capital
with
water
restoring
the
temples
and
fortifying
towns
who
followed
him
in
stands
out
more
distinctly
from
the
mists
which
envelop
the
history
of
this
period
he
repaired
the
gate
of
the
tigris
and
the
adjoining
wall
at
assur
he
enlarged
its
principal
sanctuary
reduced
several
rebellious
provinces
to
obedience
and
waged
a
successful
warfare
against
the
neighbouring
inhabitants
of
karduniash
since
the
extinction
of
the
race
of
nebuchadrezzar
babylon
had
been
a
prey
to
civil
discord
and
foreign
invasion
the
aramaean
tribes
mingled
with
or
contiguous
to
the
remnants
of
the
cossoans
bordering
on
the
persian
gulf
constituted
possibly
even
at
this
period
the
powerful
nation
of
the
kaldâ
our
only
knowledge
of
ii
is
from
a
brick
on
which
he
is
mentioned
as
being
the
grandfather
of
nirâri
ii
the
names
chaldæa
and
chaldæans
being
ordinarily
used
to
designate
the
territory
and
people
of
babylon
i
shall
employ
the
term
kaldu
or
kaldâ
in
treating
of
the
aramæan
tribes
who
constituted
the
actual
chaldæan
nation
it
has
been
supposed
not
without
probability
that
a
certain
simashshikhu
prince
of
the
country
of
the
sea
who
immediately
followed
the
last
scion
of
the
line
of
pashê
was
one
of
their
chiefs
he
endeavoured
to
establish
order
in
the
city
and
rebuilt
the
temple
of
the
sun
destroyed
by
the
nomads
at
sippar
but
at
the
end
of
eighteen
years
he
was
assassinated
his
son
eâmukinshurnu
remained
at
the
head
of
affairs
some
three
to
six
months
ruled
three
or
six
years
at
the
expiration
of
which
a
man
of
the
house
of
bâzi
by
name
seized
upon
the
crown
his
dynasty
consisted
of
three
members
himself
included
and
it
was
overthrown
after
a
duration
of
twenty
years
by
an
elamite
who
held
authority
for
another
seven
the
name
of
this
prince
has
been
read
simbarshiku
by
peiser
a
reading
adopted
by
rost
simbarshiku
would
have
been
shortened
into
sibir
and
we
should
have
to
identify
it
with
that
of
the
sibir
mentioned
by
in
his
annals
ii
as
a
king
of
karduniash
who
lived
before
his
time
see
of
the
present
volume
the
name
of
this
king
may
be
read
the
house
of
bâzi
takes
its
name
from
an
ancestor
who
must
have
founded
it
at
some
unknown
date
but
who
never
reigned
in
chaldæa
winckler
has
with
reason
conjectured
that
the
name
subsequently
lost
its
meaning
to
the
babylonians
and
that
they
confused
the
chaldæan
house
of
bâzi
with
the
arab
country
of
bâzu
this
may
explain
why
in
his
dynasties
berosos
attributes
an
arab
origin
to
that
one
which
comprises
the
line
of
our
knowledge
of
these
events
is
derived
solely
from
the
texts
of
the
babylonian
canon
published
and
translated
by
smith
by
pinches
and
by
sayce
the
inscription
of
nabubaliddin
informs
us
that
and
shâkinshumu
continued
the
works
begun
by
simashshiku
in
the
temple
of
the
sun
at
sippar
it
was
a
period
of
calamity
and
distress
during
which
the
arabs
or
the
aramæans
ravaged
the
country
and
pillaged
without
compunction
not
only
the
property
of
the
inhabitants
but
also
that
of
the
gods
the
elamite
usurper
having
died
about
the
year
a
babylonian
of
noble
extraction
expelled
the
intruders
and
succeeded
in
bringing
the
larger
part
of
the
kingdom
under
his
rule
the
names
of
the
first
kings
of
this
dynasty
are
destroyed
in
the
copies
of
the
royal
canon
which
have
come
down
to
us
the
three
preceding
dynasties
are
restored
as
follows

table
of

five
or
six
of
his
descendants
had
passed
away
and
a
certain
was
feebly
holding
the
reins
of
government
when
the
expeditions
of
iii
provoked
war
afresh
between
assyria
and
babylon
the
two
armies
encountered
each
other
once
again
on
their
former
battlefield
between
the
lower

and
the
turnat
after
being
totally
routed
near
the
yalmân
mountains
did
not
long
survive
and
naboshumishkun
who
succeeded
him
showed
neither
more
ability
nor
energy
than
his
predecessor
the
assyrians
wrested
from
him
the
fortresses
of
bambala
and
bagdad
dislodged
him
from
the
positions
where
he
had
entrenched
himself
and
at
length
took
him
prisoner
while
in
flight
and
condemned
him
to
perpetual
captivity
appears
to
have
died
about
naboshumishkun
probably
reigned
only
one
or
two
years
from

or
to

of
his
successor

destroyed
in
the
it
might
be
nabubaliddin
who
seems
to
have
had
a
long
life
but
it
is
wiser
until
fresh
light
is
thrown
on
the
subject
to
admit
that
it
is
some
prince
other
than
nabubaliddin
whose
name
is
as
yet
unknown
to
us
his
successor
abandoned
to
the
assyrians
most
of
the
districts
situated
on

a

his
adversaries
and
exposed
their
heads
upon
stakes
but
unlike
his
predecessor
he
directed
his
efforts
against
naîri
and
the
northern
and
western
tribes
we
possess
no
details
of
his
campaigns
we
can
only
surmise
that
in
six
years
from
to
he
brought
into
subjection
the
valley
of
the
upper
tigris
and
the
mountain
provinces
which
separate
it
from
the
assyrian
plain
having
reached
the
source
of
the

he
carved
beside

which
may
still
be
read

the

is
drawn
between

in

long
to
enjoy
his

but
his
death
made
no

the
fortunes
of
his
country

he
left

the
eldest
of
his
sons
embraced
scarcely
any
of
the
countries
which
had
paid
tribute
to
former
sovereigns
besides
assyria
proper
it
comprised
merely
those
districts
of
naîri
which
had
been
annexed
within
his
own
generation
the
remainder
had
gradually
regained
their
liberty

the
outlying
dependencies

and
then
the
provinces
nearer

capital

of
the
masios
and
the
zagros
the
steppes
of
the
khabur
and
even
some
districts
such
as
lubdi
and
shupria
which
had
been
allotted
to
assyrian
colonists
at
various
times
after
successful
campaigns
nearly
the
whole
empire
had
to
be
reconquered
under
much
the
same
conditions
as
in
the
first
instance
assyria
itself
it
is
true
had
recovered
the
vitality
and
elasticity
of
its
earlier
days
the
people
were
a
robust
and
energetic
race
devoted
to
their
rulers
and
ready
to
follow
them
blindly
and
trustingly
wherever
they
might
lead
the
army
while
composed
chiefly
of
the
same
classes
of
troops
as
in
the
time
of
spearmen
archers
sappers
and
slingers
now
possessed
a
new
element
whose
appearance
on
the
field
of
battle
was
to
revolutionize
the
whole
method
of
warfare
this
was
the
cavalry
properly
so
called
introduced
as
an
adjunct
to
the
chariotry
the
number
of
horsemen
forming
this
contingent
was
as
yet
small
like
the
infantry
they
wore
casques
and
cuirasses
but
were
clothed
with
a

place
of
the
long
kilt
the
folds
of
which
would
have
embarrassed
their
movements

other
half
sword
and

a
smaller
kind
than
that
used
by
the
infantry
their
horses
were
bridled
and
bore
trappings
on
the
forehead
but
had
no
saddles
their
riders
rode
bareback
without

he
has

the

riding
it
each
horseman
was
attended
by
a
groom
who
rode
abreast
of
him
and
held
his
reins
during
an
action
so
that
he
might
be
free
to
make
use
of
his
weapons
this
body
of
cavalry
having
little
confidence
in
its
own
powers
kept
in
close
contact
with
the
main
body
of
the
army
and
was
not
used
in
independent
manouvres
it
was
associated
with
and
formed
an
escort

expeditions
where
speed
was
essential
and
where
the
ordinary
foot
soldier
would
have
hampered

isolated
horsemen
must
no
doubt
have
existed
in
the
assyrian
just
as
in
the
egyptian
army

we
never
find
any
mention
of
a
of
cavalry
in
inscriptions
prior
to
the
time
of
the
introduction
of
this
new
corps
must
consequently
have
taken
place
between
the
reigns
of
and
probably
nearer
the
time
of
the
latter
himself
seldom
speaks
of
his
cavalry

he
constantly
makes

of
the
horsemen

cost
his

forced
him
back

the
ninevite
dynasties
had
persisted
in
their
pretensions
to
a
suzerainty

they
had
generally
been
unable
to
enforce
the
tradition
of
which
unsupported
by
any
definite
decree
had
been
handed
on
from
one
generation
to
another

in
practice
their
kings
had
not
succeeded

bel

in
reigning
personally
in
babylon
nor
in
extorting
from
the
native
sovereign
an
official
acknowledgment
of
his
vassalage
profiting
doubtless
by
past
experience
resolutely
avoided
those
direct
conflicts
in
which
so
many
of
his
predecessors
had
wasted
their
lives
if
he
did
not
actually
renounce
his
hereditary
pretensions
he
was
content
to
let
them
lie
dormant

preferred
to
accommodate
himself
to
the
terms
of
the
treaty
signed
a
few
years
previously
by
even
when
babylon
neglected
to
observe
them
he
closed
his
eyes
to
the
many
acts
of
hostility
to
which
he
was
exposed

devoted
all
his
energies
to
dealing

frontier
touched

was

enough

to
place
it

oblige
us
to
locate
the
country
in

of

and
i
should
place
it
near

where
different
forms
of
the
word
occur
many
times
on
the
map
such
as
ghalzan
in
kharzan
the

of
a
caza
of
the
sandjak
of
sert
khizan
the
name
of
a
caza
of
the
sandjak
of

would
thus
be
the
roman
province
of
arzanene

in

in
which
the
initial
g
or
h
of

ancient
name
has
been
replaced

has
been
placed
by
lenormant
to
the
east
of
the
upper
zab
and
south
of
arapkha
and
this
identification
has
been
approved
by
schrader
and
also
by
delitzsch
according
to
the
passages
that
schrader
himself
has
cited
it
must
however
have
stretched
northwards
as
far
as
meeting
gilzân
at
one
point
of
the
sandjaks
of
van
and
hakkiari
in
going
from
kirruri
to
kirkhi
in
the
basin
of
the
tigris
could
go
either
by
the
pass
of
bitlis
or
that
of
sassun
that
of
bitlis
is
excluded
by
the
fact
that
it
lies
in
kirruri

kirruri
is
not
mentioned
in
what
follows

if
the
route
chosen
was
by
the
pass
of
sassun
khulun
necessarily
must
have
occupied
a
position
at
the
entrance
of
the
defiles
perhaps
that
of
the
present
town
of

that
of
the

probably
to

second
year
of
his
reign
was
no
less
fully
occupied
nor
did
it
prove
less
successful
than
the
first
at
its
very
beginning
and
even
before
the
return
of
the
favourable
season
the
sukhi
on

euphrates
made

untoward

good
impression
he

made
the
descendants
of
the
colonists
planted
in
bygone
times
by
shalmaneser
on
the
western
slope
of
the
masios
in
the
district
of
khalzidipkha
had
thrown
off
their
allegiance
and
their
leader
khulaî
was
besieging
the
royal
fortress
of
damdamusa
marched
direct
to
the
sources
of
the
tigris
and
the
mere
fact
of
his
presence
sufficed
to
prevent
any
rising
in
that
quarter
he
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
set
up
a
stele
beside
those
of
his
father
and
his
ancestor
and
then
having
halted
to
receive
the
tribute
of
izalla
he
turned
southwards
and
took
up
a
position
on
the
slopes
of
the
kashiari
the
position
of
khalzidipkha
or
khalzilukha
as
well
as
that
of
its
stronghold
is
shown
approximately
by
what
follows
marching
from
the
sources
of
the
supnat
towards
tela
could
pass
either
to
the
east
or
west
of
the
as
the
end
of
the
campaign
finds
him
at
tushkhân
to
the
south
of
the
tigris
and
he
returns
to
naîri
and
kirkhi
by
the
eastern
side
of
the
we
are
led
to
conclude
that
the
outgoing
march
to
tela
was
by
the
western
side
through
the
country
situated
between
the
and
the
euphrates
on
referring
to
a
modern
map
two
rather
important
places
will
be
found
in
this
locality
the
first
arghana
commanding
the
road
from
diarbekîr
to
the
other
severek
on
the
route
from
diarbekîr
to
orfah
arghana
appears
to
me
to
correspond
to
the
royal
city
of
damdamusa
which
would
thus
have
protected
the
approach
to
the
plain
on
the
severek
corresponds
fairly
well
to
the
position
which
according
to
the
assyrian
text
kinabu
must
have
occupied
hence
the
country
of
khalzidipkha
khalzilukha
must
be
the
district
of
severek
izalla
written
also
izala
azala
paid
its
tribute
in
sheep
and
oxen
and
also
produced
a
wine
for
which
it
continued
to
be
celebrated
down
to
the
time
of
nebuchadrezzar
ii
lenormant
and
finzi
place
this
near
to
nisibis
where
the
byzantine
and
syrian
writers
mention
a
district
and
a
mountain
of
the
same
name
and
this
conjecture
is
borne
out
by
the
passages
of
the
of
which
place
it
in
the
vicinity
of
and
it
has
also
been
adopted
by
most
of
the
historians
who
have
recently
studied
the
question
at
the
first
news
of
his
approach
khulai
had
raised
the
blockade
of
damdamusa
and
had
entrenched
himself
in
kinabu
the
assyrians
however
carried
the
place
by
storm
and
six
hundred
soldiers
of
the
garrison
were
killed
in
the
attack
the
survivors
to
the
number
of
three
thousand
together
with
many
women
and
children
were
thrown
into
the
flames
the
people
of
mariru
hastened
to
the
rescue
the
assyrians
took
three
hundred
of
them
prisoners
and
burnt
them
alive
fifty
others
were
ripped
up
but
the
victors
did
not
stop
to
reduce
their
town
the
district
of
nirbu
was
next
subjected
to
systematic
ravaging
and
half
of
its
inhabitants
fled
into
the
mesopotamian
desert
while
the
remainder
sought
refuge
in
tela
at
the
foot
of
the
ukhira
the
site
of
mariru

unknown
according
to
the
text
of
the
annals
it
ought
to
lie
near
severek
kinabu

the

the
south
and
the
latter
place
was
a
strong
one
being
surrounded
by
three
enclosing
walls
and
it
offered
an
obstinate
resistance
notwithstanding
this
it
at
length
fell
after
having
lost
three
thousand
of
its
defenders
some
of
its
garrison
were
condemned
to
the
stake
some
had
their
hands
noses
or
ears
cut
off
others
were
deprived
of
sight
flayed
alive
or
impaled
amid
the
smoking
ruins
this
being
deemed
insufficient
punishment
the
conqueror
degraded
the
place
from
its
rank
of
chief
town
transferring
this
together
with
its
other
privileges
to
a
neighbouring
city
tushkhân
which
had
belonged
to
the
assyrians
from
the
beginning
of
their
conquests
the
king
enlarged
the
place
added
to
it
a
strong
enclosing
wall
and
installed
within
it
the
survivors
of
the
older
colonists
who
had
been
dispersed
by
the
war
the
majority
of
whom
had
taken
refuge
in
shupria
from
this
passage
we
learn
that
tushkhân
also
called
tushkha
was
situated
on
the
border
of
nirbu
while
from
another
passage
in
the
campaign
of
the
vth
year
we
find
that
it
was
on
the
right
bank
of
the
tigris
following
rawlinson
i
place
it
at
kurkh
near
the
tigris
to
the
east
of
diarbekîr
the
existence
in
that
locality
of
an
inscription
of

to
prove
the
correctness
of
this
identification
we
are
aware
in
fact
of
the
particular
favour
in
which
this
prince
held
tushkhân
for
he
speaks
with
pride
of
the
buildings
with
which
he
embellished

however

with
the
town

made

has
been

been
brought
into
submission
from
the
time

we
gather
from
the
passages
in

it

mentioned
that
it
was
a
hilly
country

rich
in

and
lying
at
a
short
distance
from

perhaps
mariru

one
of
its
towns

we
may
safely

it

there
built

the

unknown
to
us
it
was
at
all
events
a
military
station
on
the
road
to
nineveh
along
which
the
king
returned
victorious
with
the

at

were

petty
wars

their
immediate
results
appear
at
the

glance
quite
inadequate
to
account
for
the
contemporary
enthusiasm
they
excited
the
sincerity
of
it
can
be
better
understood
when
we
consider
the
miserable
state
of
the
country
twenty
years
previously
assyria
then
comprised
two
territories
one
in
the
plains
of
the
middle
the
other
in
the
districts
of
the
upper
tigris
both
of
considerable
extent
but
almost
without
regular
intercommunication
caravans
or
isolated
messengers
might
pass
with
tolerable
safety
from
assur
and
nineveh
to
singar
or
even
to
nisibis
but
beyond
these
places
they
had
to
brave
the
narrow
defiles
and
steep
paths
in
the
forests
of
the
masios
through
which
it
was
rash
to
venture
without
keeping
eye
and
ear
ever
on
the
alert
the
mountaineers
and
their
chiefs
recognized
the
nominal
suzerainty
of
assyria
but
refused
to
act
upon
this
recognition
unless
constrained
by
a
strong
hand
if
this
control
were
relaxed
they
levied
contributions
on
or
massacred
all
who
came
within
their
reach
and
the
king
himself
never
travelled
from
his
own
city
of
nineveh
to
his
own
town
of
amidi
unless
accompanied
by
an
army
in
less
than
the
short
space
of
three
years
had
remedied
this
evil
by
the
slaughter
of
some
two
hundred
men
in
one
place
three
hundred
in

the
following
season
the
course
of
events
diverted
the
efforts
into
quite
an
opposite
direction
under
the
name
of
zamua
there
existed
a
number
of
small
states
scattered
along
the
western
slope
of
the
iranian
plateau
north
of
the
cossæans
many
of
them
as
for
instance
the
lullumê
had
been
civilized
by
the
chaldæans
almost
from
time
immemorial
the
most
southern
among
them
were
perpetually
oscillating
between
the
respective
areas
of
influence
of
babylon
and
nineveh
according
as
one
or
other
of
these
cities
was
in
the
ascendant

at
this
particular
moment
they
acknowledged
assyrian
sway
were
they
excited
to
rebellion
against
the
latter
power
by
the
emissaries
of
its
rival
or
did
they
merely
think
that
was
too
fully
absorbed
in
the
affairs
of
naîri
to
be
able
to
carry
his
arms
effectively
elsewhere
at
all
events
they
coalesced
under
nurrammân
the
sheikh
of
dagara
blocked
the
pass
of
babiti

led
to
their

massed

taking
the

he
marched
along
that

put

at
the
spot
where
jones
noticed
important
assyrian
ruins
excavated
by
layard
as
the
campaign
threatened
to
be
prolonged
he
formed
an
entrenched
camp
in
a
favourable
position
and
stationed
in
it
some
of
his
troops
to
guard
the
booty
while
he
dispersed
the
rest
to
pillage
the
country
on
all
sides
illustration
the
campaigns
of
in
zamua
one
expedition
led
him
to
the
mountain
group
of
nizir
at
the
end
of
the
chain
known
to
the
people
of
lullumê
as
the
kinipa
he
there
reduced
to
ruins
seven
towns
whose
inhabitants
had
barricaded
themselves
in
urgent
haste
collected
the
few
herds
of
cattle
he
could
find
and
driving
them
back
to
the
camp
set
out
afresh
towards
a
part
of
nizir
as
yet
unsubdued
by
any
conqueror
the
stronghold
of
larbusa
fell
before
the
to
be
followed
shortly
by
the
capture
of
bara
thereupon
the
chiefs
of
zamua
convinced
of
their
helplessness
purchased
the
departure
by
presents
of
horses
gold
silver
and
corn
nurrammân
alone
remained
impregnable
in
his
retreat
at
nishpi
and
an
attempt
to
oust
him
resulted
solely
in
the
surrender
of
the
fortress
of
birutu
the
campaign
far
from
having
been
decisive
had
to
be
continued
during
the
winter
in
another
direction
where
revolts
had
taken
place
in
khudun
in
kissirtu
and
in
the
fief
of
arashtua
all
three
of
which
extended
over
the
upper
valleys
of
the
lesser
zab
the
radanu
the
turnat
and
their
affluents
mount
kinipa
is
a
part
of
nizir
the
if
we
from
the
direction
of
the
assyrian
campaign
none
of
these
places
can
be
identified
with
certainty
the
gist
of
the
account
leads
us
to
gather
that
bara
was
situated
to
the
east
of
dagara
and
formed
its
frontier
we
shall
not
be
far
wrong
in
looking
for
all
these
districts
in
the
fastnesses
of
the
in
the
caza
of
suleimaniyeh
mount
nishpi
is
perhaps
the
of
the
present
day
the
assyrian
compiler
appears
to
have
made
use
of
two
slightly
differing
accounts
of
this
campaign
he
has
twice
repeated
the
same
facts
without
noticing
his
mistake
the
fief
of
arashtua
situated
beyond
the
turnat
is
probably
the
district
of
suleimaniyeh
it
is
indeed
at
this
place
only
that
the
upper
course
of
the
turnat
is
sufficiently
near
to
that
of
the
radanu
to
make
the
marches
of
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
assyrian
scribe
possible
according
to
the
account
of
the
it
seems
to
me
that
we
must
seek
for
khudun
and
kissirtu
to
the
south
of
the
fief
of
arashtua
in
the
modern
cazas
of
gulanbar
or
shehrizôr
the
king
once
more
set
out
from
kakzi
crossed
the
zab
and
the
eadanu
through
the
gorges
of
babiti
and
halting
on
the
ridges
of
mount
simaki
peremptorily
demanded
tribute
from
dagara
this
was
however
merely
a
ruse
to
deceive
the
enemy
for
taking
one
evening
the
lightest
of
his
chariots
and
the
best
of
his
horsemen
he
galloped
all
night
without
drawing
rein
crossed
the
turnat
at
dawn
and
pushing
straight
forward
arrived
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
before
the
walls
of
ammali
in
the
very
heart
of
the
fief
of
arashtua
the
town
vainly
attempted
a
defence
the
whole
population
was
reduced
to
slavery
or
dispersed
in
the
forests
the
ramparts
were
demolished
and
the
houses
reduced
to
ashes
khudun
with
twenty
and
kissirtu
with
ten
of
its
villages
bara
kirtiara
and
bunisa
offered
no
further
resistance
and
the
invading
host
halted
within
sight
of
the
defiles
of
khashmar
the
of
go
on
to
mention
that
mount
simaki
extended
as
far
as
the
turnat
and
that
it
was
close
to
mount
azira
this
passage
when
compared
with
that
in
which
the
opening
of
the
campaign
is
described
obliges
us
to
recognise
in
mounts
simaki
and
azira
two
parts
of
the
shehrizôr
chain
parallel
to
the
the
fortress
of
mizu
mentioned
in
the
first
of
these
two
texts
may
perhaps
be
the
present
hommel
thinks
that
ammali
is
perhaps
the
present
suleimaniyeh
it
is
at
all
events
on
this
side
that
we
must
look
for
its
site
i
do
not
know
whether
we
may
trace
the
name
of
the
ancient
mount
in
the
present
it
is
at
its
feet
probably
in
the
valley
of
suleimanabad
that
we
ought
to
place
the
passes
of
khashmar
one
kinglet
however
amika
of
zamru
showed
no
intention
of
capitulating
entrenched
behind
a
screen
of
forests
and
frowning
mountain
ridges
he
fearlessly
awaited
the
attack
the
only
access
to
the
remote
villages
over
which
he
ruled
was
by
a
few
rough
roads
hemmed
in
between
steep
cliffs
and
beds
of
torrents
difficult
and
dangerous
at
ordinary
times
they
were
blocked
in
war
by
temporary
barricades
and
dominated
at
every
turn
by
some
fortress
perched
at
a
dizzy
height
above
them
after
his
return
to
the
camp
where
his
soldiers
were
allowed
a
short
respite
set
out
against
zamru
though
he
was
careful
not
to
approach
it
directly
and
attack
it
at
its
most
formidable
points
between
two
peaks
of
the
lara
and
bidirgi
ranges
he
discovered
a
path
which
had
been
deemed
impracticable
for
horses
or
even
for
heavily
armed
men
by
this
route
the
king
unsuspected
by
the
enemy
made
his
way
through
the
mountains
and
descended
so
unexpectedly
upon
zamru
that
amika
had
barely
time
to
make
his
escape
abandoning
everything
in
his
alarm
palace
treasures
harem
and
even
his
chariot
a
body
of
assyrians
pursued
him
hotly
beyond
the
fords
of
the
lallu
chasing
him
as
far
as
mount
itini
then
retracing
their
steps
to
headquarters
they
at
once
set
out
on
a
fresh
track
crossed
the
idir
and
proceeded
to
lay
waste
the
plains
of
ilaniu
and
suâni
this
raid
which
started
from
the
same
point
as
the
preceding
one
ran
eastwards
in
an
opposite
direction
and
ended
at
mount
itini
leaving
the
fief
of
arashtua
in
the
neighbourhood
of
suleimaniyeh
crossed
the
chain
of
the
near
and
gudrun
where
we
must
place
mounts
lara
and
bidirgi
and
emerged
upon
zamru
the
which
appear
to
correspond
to
zamru
in
that
region
are
kandishin
and
suleimanabad
hence
the
lallu
is
the
river
which
runs
by
kandishin
and
suleimanabad
and
itini
the
mountain
which
separates
this
river
from
the
i
think
we
may
recognise
the
ancient
name
of
ilaniu
in
that
of
alan
now
borne
by
a
district
on
the
turkish
and
persian
frontier
situated
between
kunekd
and
the
town
of
serdesht
the
expedition
coming
from
the
fief
of
arashtua
must
have
marched
northwards
the
idir
in
this
case
must
be
the
and
mount
sabua
the
chain
of
mountains
above
serdesht
despairing
of
taking
amika
prisoner
allowed
him
to
lie
hidden
among
the
brushwood
of
mount
sabua
while
he
himself
called
a
halt
at
parsindu
and
set
to
work
to
organise
the
fruits
of
his
conquest
parsindu
mentioned
between
mount
ilaniu
and
the
town
of
zamru
ought
to
lie
somewhere
in
the
valley
of
kizildjik
near
murana
he
placed
garrisons
in
the
principal
towns
parsindu
zamru
and
at
arakdi
in
lullumê
which
one
of
his
predecessors
had

taken
the

on
the
surrounding
country

annual
tribute
of
gold

copper
dyed
stuffs
oxen
sheep
and

envoys
from
neighbouring
kings
poured
in
from
khudun
khubushkia
and
gilzân
and
the
whole
of
northern
zamua
bowed
the
splendour
of
his
arms
it
now
needed
only
a
few
raids
resolutely
directed
against
mounts
azîra
and
simaki
as
far
as
the
turn
at
to
achieve
the
final
pacification
of
the
south
while
in
this
neighbourhood
his
attention
was
directed
to
the
old
town
of
atlîla
built
by
sibir
an
ancient
king
of
karduniash
but
which
had
been
half
ruined
by
the
barbarians
he
it
fortress
of
assur
and
built
himself
within
it
a
palace
and
storehouses
in
which
he
accumulated
large
quantities
of
corn
making
the
town
the
strongest
bulwark
of
his
power
on
the
cossæan
border
approximate
site
of
arakdi
is
indicated
in
the
itinerary
of
itself
the
king

from
zamru
in
the
neighbourhood
of
crosses
mount
lara

is
the
northern
part
of

arrives
at
arakdi
possibly
somewhere
in
surtash
in
the
course
of
the
preceding
campaign
after
having
laid
waste
bara
he
set
out
from
this
same
town
arakdi
to
subdue
nishpi
all
of
which
bears
out
the
position
i
have
indicated
the
present
town
of
baziân
would
answer
fairly
well
for
the
site
of
a
place
destined
to
protect
the
assyrian
frontier
on
this
side
given
its
position
on
the
chaldæan
frontier
atlîla
is
probably
to
be
identified
with
the
kerkuk
of
the
present
day
hommel
is
inclined
to
believe
that
sibir
was
the
immediate
predecessor
of
nabubaliddin
who
reigned
at
babylon
at
the
same
time
as
at
nineveh
consequently
he
would
be
a
contemporary
of
iii
and
of
ii
peiser
and
rost
have
identified
him
with
illustration
the
zab
below
the
passes
of
alan
the
ancient
ilaniu
drawn
by
boudier
from
a
photograph
by
de
morgan
the
two
campaigns
of
and
had
cost
great
efforts
and
their
results
had
been
inadequate
to
the
energy
expended
his
two
principal
adversaries
nurrammân
and
amika
had
eluded
him
and
still
preserved
their
independence
at
the
eastern
extremities
of
their
former
states
most
of
the
mountain
tribes
had
acknowledged
the
supremacy
merely
provisionally
in
order
to
rid
themselves
of
his
presence
they
had
been
vanquished
scores
of
times
but
were
in
no
sense
subjugated
and
the
moment
pressure
was
withdrawn
they
again
took
up
arms
the
districts
of
zamua
alone
which
bordered
on
the
assyrian
plain
and
had
been
occupied
by
a
military
force
formed
a
province
a
kind
of
buffer
state
between
the
mountain
tribes
and
the
plains
of
the
zab
protecting
the
latter
from
incursions
feeling
himself
tolerably
safe
on
that
side
made
no
further
demands
and
withdrew
his
battalions
to
the
westward
part
of
his
northern
frontier
he
hoped
no
doubt
to
complete
the
subjugation
of
the
tribes
who
still
contested
the
possession
of
various
parts
of
the
kashiari
and
then
to
push
forward
his
main
guard
as
far
as
the
euphrates
and
the
arzania
so
as
to
form
around
the
plain
of
amidi
a
zone
of
vassals
or
tutelary
subjects
like
those
of
zamua
with
this
end
in
view
he
crossed
the
tigris
near
its
source
at
the
traditional
fords
and
made
his
way
unmolested
in
the
bend
of
the
euphrates
from
the
palace
of
tilluli
where
the
accustomed
tribute
of
kummukh
was
brought
to
him
to
the
fortress
of
ishtarâti
and
from
thence
to
kibaki
the
town
of
matiatê
having
closed
its
gates
against
him
was
at
once
sacked
and
this
example
so
stimulated
the
loyalty
of
the
kurkhi
chiefs
that
they
to
welcome
him
at
the
neighbouring
military
station
of
zazabukha
the
progress
continued
thence
as
before
broken
by
frequent
halts
at
the
most
favourable
points
for
levying
contributions
on
the
encountered
no
serious
difficulty
except
on
the
northern
slopes
of
the
kashiari
but
there
again
fortune
smiled
on
him
all
the
contested
positions
were
soon
ceded
to
him
including
even
madara
whose
fourfold
circuit
of
walls
did
not
avail
to
save
it
from
the
conqueror
after
a
brief
respite
at
tushkhân
he
set
out
again
one
evening
with
his
lightest
chariots
and
the
pick
of
his
horsemen
crossed
the
tigris
on
rafts
rode
all
night
and
arrived
unexpectedly
the
next
morning
before
pitura
the
chief
town
of
the
dirrabans
it
was
surrounded
by
a
strong
double
enceinte
through
which
he
broke
after
hours
of
continuous
assault
of
its
men
perished
in
the
breach
and
others
were
impaled
before
the
gates
it
is
difficult
to
place
any
of
these
localities
on
the
map
they
ought
all
to
be
found
between
the
ford
of
the
tigris
at
diarbeldr
and
the
euphrates
probably
at
the
foot
of
the
and
the
madara
belonged
to
a
certain
lapturi
son
of
tubusi
mentioned
in
the
campaign
of
the
second
year
in
comparing
the
facts
given
in
the
two
passages
we
see
it
was
situated
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
kashiari
not
far
from
tushkhan
on
one
side
and
ardupa
that
is
probably
mardin
on
the
other
the
position
of
ortaveran
or
of
one
of
the
in
its
neighbourhood
answers
fairly
well
to
these
conditions
according
to
the
details
given
in
the
we
must
place
the
town
of
bitura
or
pitura
at
about
miles
from
kurkh
on
the
other
side
of
the
tigris
in
a
direction
and
consequently
the
country
of
lirrâ
would
be
between
the
and
the
the
matni
with
its
passes
leading
in
to
naîri
must
in

there
he
called
a
halt
facing
some
town
on
the
opposite

but
the

which

have
put

across
had
been

guarded
to

khindânu
made
him
a

he
affected
to
regard
as
a
tribute
but
kharidi
and
anat
appeared
not
even
to
suspect
his
presence
in
their
vicinity
and
he
continued
on
his
way
without
having
obtained
from
them
anything
which
could
be
construed
into
a
mark
of
vassalage
the

us
that

this
information
enables
us
to
determine
on

with
tolerable
certainty
the
localities
mentioned
in
this
campaign
the
mountain
in
question
can
be
none
other
than
the
only
one
met
with
on
this
bank
of
the
euphrates
between
the
confluents
of
the
euphrates
and
the
khabur
khindânu
is
therefore
identical
with
the
ruins
of

the
dabausa
of

hence
supri

situated
between
this
point
and

the

the
direction
of

the

the

the

a
relic
of
that

kharidi

in
that
case
to
be
looked
for
on
the
opposite
bank
near
and
aksubi
where
chesney
points
out
ancient
remains
a
march
beyond
kabr
brings
us
to
so
that
the
town
of

would
be
in
the
isle
of

shuru

be
somewhere
near

him
battle

he
was
defeated
by

captured
the

of
brother
forced
his
way
into
the
town
after
an
assault
lasting
two
days
and
returned
to
assyria
laden
with
spoil
this
might
almost
be
considered
as
a
repulse
for
no
sooner
had
the
king
quitted
the
country
than
the
aramaeans
in
their
turn
crossed
the
euphrates
and
ravaged
the
plains
of

resolved
not
to
return
until
he
was
in
a
position
to
carry
his
arms
into
the
heart
of
the
country
he
built
a
flotilla
at
shuru
in
on
which
he
embarked
his
troops
wherever
the
navigation
of
the
euphrates
proved
to
be
difficult
the
boats
were
drawn
up
out
of
the
water
and
dragged
along
the

over
rollers
until
they

launched
thus
partly
afloat
and
partly
on

they
passed
through
the
gorge
of

landed
at

and
inflicted
a
salutary
punishment
on
the
cities
which
had
defied
the
wrath
on
his
last
expedition
khindânu
kharidi
and
kipina
were
reduced
to
ruins
and
the
sukhi
and
the

as
the
frontiers
of
the

not
give
us
either
the
or
the
date
of
the
year
for
this
new
expedition
the
facts
taken
altogether
prove
that
it
was
a
continuation
of
the
preceding
one
and
it
may
therefore
be
placed
in
the
year
the
campaign
of
had
for
its
arena
that
of
the
euphrates
which
lies
between
the
khabur
and
the
balikh
this
time
however
the
principal
operations
took
place
on
the
right
bank
if
mount
bisuru
is
the
the
town
of
kipina
which
is
mentioned
between
it
and
kharidi
ought
to
be
located
between
maidân
and
sabkha
a
complete
submission
was
brought
about
and
its
permanency
secured
by
the
erection
of
two
strongholds
one
of
which
commanded
the
left
and
the
other
the
right
bank
of
the
euphrates
this
last
expedition
had
brought
the
king
into
contact
with
the
most
important
of
the
numerous
aramaean
states
congregated
in
the
western
region
of
mesopotamia
this
was
which
lay
on
both
sides
of
the
middle
course

included
on
the

the

of

of
its
princes
whose
authority
also
extended
eastwards
as

as
the

of

desert
the
account
in
the
annals
is
confused
and
contains
perhaps
some
errors
with
regard
to
the
facts
the
site
of
the
two
towns
is
nowhere
indicated
but
a
study
of
the
map
shows
that
the
assyrians
could
not
become
masters
of
the
country
without
occupying
the
passes
of
the
euphrates
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
is
and
zalebiyeh
the
zenobia
of
roman
times
appears
to
have
occupied
on
the
right
bank
of

none

the
only
possible
site
that
i
can
find

the

of

times
the

nowhere
mentioned
as
belonging

to

to

must
hence
conclude
that
at
this
period
it
formed
a
little
principality
independent
of
those
two
states
the
situation
of
is
shown
by
the
position
which
it

the
account
of
the

by
the
names
associated

it

another
passage
of

by

of

fulfilled
their
duties
as
vassals
whenever
had
appeared
in
their
neighbourhood
alone
had
remained
independent
though
its
strength
was
more
apparent
than
real
the
districts
which
it
included
had
never
been
able
to
form
a
basis
for
a
powerful
state
if
by
chance
some
small
kingdom
arose
within
it
uniting
under
one
authority
the
tribes
scattered
over
the
burning
plain
or
along
the
river
banks
the
first
conquering
dynasty
which
sprang
up
in
the
neighbourhood
would
be
sure
to
effect
its
downfall
and
absorb
it
under
its
own
leadership
as
mitâni
saved
by
its
remote
position
from
bondage
to
egypt
had
not
been
able
to
escape
from
acknowledging
the
supremacy
of
the
khâti
so
was
destined
to
fall
almost
without
a
struggle
under
the
yoke
of
the
assyrians
it
was
protected
from
their
advance
by
the
volcanic
groups
of
the
urâa
and
which
lay
directly
in
the
way
of
the
main
road
from
the
marshes
of
the
khabur
to
the
outskirts
of
who
might
have
worked
round
this
line
of
natural
defence
to
the
north
through
nirbu
or
to
the
south
through
his
recently
acquired
province
of
lâqi

to
approach
it
in

he
faced
the
desert
and
in
spite
of
the
drought
he
invested
the
strongest
citadel
of
in
the
month
of
june
the
name
of
the
place
was
kaprabi
and
its
inhabitants
believed
it
impregnable
clinging
as
it
did
to
the
a
cloud
in
the
the
name
is
commonly
interpreted
rock
and
divided
thus
it
may
also
be
considered
like
kapridargila
or
kapranishâ
as
being
formed
of
and
this
latter
element
appears
to
exist
in
the
ancient
name
of
telaba
thallaba
now
might
be
a
fortress
of
the
province
of
the
king
however
soon
demolished
its
walls
by
sapping
and
by
the
use
of
the
ram
killed
of
its
garrison
burned
its
houses
and
carried
off

their
families

he

of

suburbs
of

was
then
reigning

not
anticipated
that
the
invasion
would
reach
his
neighbourhood
he
at
once
sent
hostages
and
purchased
peace
by
a
tribute
the
lord
of
followed
his
example
and
the
dominion
of
assyria
was
carried
at
a
blow
to
the
very
frontier
of
the
khâti
it
was
about
two
centuries
before
this
that
assurirba
had
crossed
these
frontiers
with
his
vanquished
army
but
the
remembrance
of
his
defeat
had
still
remained
fresh
in
the
memory
of
the
people
as
a
warning
to
the
sovereign
who
should
attempt
the
old
hazardous
enterprise
and
repeat
the
exploits
of
sargon
of
agadê
or
of
made
careful
preparations
for
this
campaign
so
decisive
a
one
for
his
own
prestige
and
for
the
future
of
the
empire
he
took
with
him
not
only
all
the
assyrian
troops
at
his
disposal
but
requisitioned
by
the
way
the
armies
of
his
most
recently
acquired
vassals
incorporating
them
with
his
own
not
so
much
for
the
purpose
of
augmenting
his
power
of
action
as
to
leave
no
force
in
his
rear
when
once
he
was
engaged
hand
to
hand
with
the
syrian
legions
he
left
calah
in
the
latter
days
of
april
receiving
the
customary
taxes
from
izalla
and
which
comprised
horses
silver
gold
copper
lead
precious
stuffs
vessels
of
copper
and
furniture
of
ivory
having
reached
he
accepted
the
gifts
offered
by
and
crossing
the
euphrates
upon
rafts
of
inflated
skins
he
marched
his
columns
against
oarchemish
on
the
iyyâr
but
without
any
indication
of
limmu
or
any
number
of
the
year
or
of
the
campaign
the
date
is
admitted
by
the
majority
of
historians
the
political
organisation
of
northern
syria
had
remained
entirely
unaltered
since
the
days
when
made
his
first
victorious
inroad
into
the
country
the
cilician
empire
which
succeeded
to
the
assyrian

excite
his
cupidity
this
discretion
would
be
inexplicable
did
we
not
know
that
there
existed
in
that
region
a
formidable
power
which
he
may
have
thought
it
imprudent
to
provoke
it
was
damascus
which
held
sway
over
those
territories
whose
frontiers
he
respected
and
its
kings
also
suzerains
of
hamath
and
masters
of
half
israel
were
powerful
enough
to
resist
if
not
conquer
any
enemy
who
might
present
himself
the
fear
inspired
by
damascus
naturally
explains
the
attitude
adopted
by
the
hittite
states
towards
the
invader
and
the
precautions
taken
by
the
latter
to
restrict
his
operations
within
somewhat
narrow
limits
having
accepted
the
complimentary
presents
of
the
phoenicians
the
king
again
took
his
way
northwards
making
a
slight
detour
in
order
to
ascend
the
amanos
for
the
purpose
of
erecting
there
a
stele
commemorating
his
exploits
and
of
cutting
pines
cedars
and
larches
for
his
buildings
and
then
returned
to
nineveh
amid
the
acclamations
of
his
people
in
reading
the
history
of
this
campaign
its
plan
and
the
principal
events
which
took
place
in
it
appear
at
times
to
be
the
echo
of
what
had
happened
some
centuries
before
the
recapitulation
of
the
near
the
sources
of
the
tigris
and
on
the
banks
of
the
upper
euphrates
the
marches
through
the
valleys
of
the
zagros
or
on
the
slopes
of
kashiari
the
crushing
one
by
one
of
the
mesopotamian
races
ending
in
a
triumphal
progress
through
northern
syria
is
almost
a
repetition
both
as
to
the
names
and
order
of
the
places
mentioned
of
the
expedition
made
by
in
the
first
five
years
of
his
reign
the
question
may
well
arise
in
passing
whether
consciously
modelled
his
campaign
on
that
of
his
ancestor
as
in
egypt
ramses
iii
imitated
ramses
or
whether
in
similar
circumstances
he
instinctively
and
naturally
followed
the
same
line
of
march
in
either
case
he
certainly
showed
on
all
sides
greater
wisdom
than
his
predecessor
and
having
attained
the
object
of
his
ambition
avoided
compromising
his
success
by
injudiciously
attacking
damascus
or
babylon
the
two
powers
who
alone
could
have
offered
effective
resistance
the
victory
he
had
gained
in
over
the
brother
of
had
immensely
flattered
his
vanity
his
panegyrists
vied
with
each
other
in
depicting
karduniash
bewildered
by
the
terror
of
his
majesty
and
the
chaldæans
overwhelmed
by
the
fear
of
his
arms
but
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
their
extravagant
flatteries
and
continued
to
the
end
of
his
reign
to
observe
the
treaties
concluded
between
the
two
courts
in
the
time
of
his
grandfather
his
frontier
on
the
chaldæan
side
between
the
tigris
and
the
mountains
was
the
boundary
fixed
by
he
had
however
sufficiently
enlarged
his
dominions
in
less
than
ten
years
to
justify
some
display
of
pride
he
himself
described
his
empire
as
extending
on
the
west
of
assyria
proper
from
the
banks
of
the
tigris
near
nineveh
to
lebanon
and
the
mediterranean
besides
which

was
subject
to
him

this
included

province
of

frontiers
of

while
the
extensive
country
of

which
alternately
gave
their
adherence

formed

borders
of

kingdom

despite
repeated
blows
inflicted
on
them

not
succeeded
in

factors
into

compact
and
homogeneous
whole
some
small
proportion
of

assimilated
to

were

nineveh
from
the
time
of

accession
to
the

from
thence
he
had
set
out
on
four
successive
campaigns

who
came
to

him
homage

implored
his

foreign
attacks
thither
he

they
had
marched
in
ignominy
through
the
streets
he
had
put
them
to
torture

to
death

of
the
crowd

skins

still
hanging

of
his
capital
the
ancient
capital
no

suited
his
present
state
as
a
conqueror
the
accommodation
was
too
restricted
the

too
poor

probably
the

in

the

space

only
have
been
obtained
by
altering
the
course
of

sacrificing
a

of
the
adjoining
quarters
of
the
city

preferred
to
abandon
the
place
and
to
select

apparently
forgotten

lessons
they
had

much
bloodshed

girded
on
his
armour
and
led
his
troops
to

vigorously
as
in

hastily
collected

this
was
his

exploit
he
never
subsequently
quitted
his
hereditary
domain
but
there
passed
the
remaining
seven
years
of
his
life
in
peace
if
not
in
idleness
he
died
in
after
a
reign
of
years
his
portraits
represent
him
as
a
vigorous
man
with
a
brawny
neck
and
broad
shoulders
capable
of
bearing
the
weight
of
his
armour
for
many
hours
at
a
time
he
is
short
in
the
head
with
a
somewhat
flattened
skull
and
low

his
eyes
are
large
and
beneath
bushy
eyebrows
his
high
and
his
nose
aquiline
with
a
fleshy
tip
and
wide
nostrils
while
his
mouth
and
chin
are
hidden
by
moustache
and
beard
the
whole
figure
is
instinct
with
real
dignity
yet
such
dignity
as
is
due
rather
to
rank
and
the
habitual
exercise
of
power
than
to
the
innate
qualities
of
the
man
perrot
and
chipiez
do
not
admit
that
the
assyrian
sculptors
intended
to
represent
the
features
of
their
kings
for
this
they
rely
chiefly
on
the
remarkable
likeness
between
all
the
figures
in
the
same
series
of
my
own
belief
is
that
in
assyria
as
in
egypt
the
sculptors
took
the
portrait
of
the
reigning
sovereign
as
the
model
for
all
their
figures
the
character
of
as
gathered
from
the
dry
details
of
his
annals
seems
to
have
been
very
complex
he
was
as
ambitious
resolute
and
active
as
any
prince
in
the
world
yet
he
refrained
from
offensive
warfare
as
soon
as
his
victories
had
brought
under
his
rule
the
majority
of
the
countries
formerly
subject
to
i
he
knew
the
crucial
moment
for
ending
a
campaign
arresting
his
progress
where
one
more
success
might
have
brought
him
into
collision
with
some
formidable
neighbour
and
this
wise
prudence
in
his
undertakings
enabled
him
to
retain
the
principal
acquisitions
won
by
his
arms
as
a
worshipper
of
the
gods
he
showed
devotion
and
gratitude
he
was
just
to
his
subjects
but
his
conduct
towards
his
enemies
was
so
savage
as
to
appear
to
us
cruel
even
for
that
terribly
pitiless
age
no
king
ever
employed
such
horrible
punishments
or
at
least
none
has
described
with
such
satisfaction
the
tortures
inflicted
on
his
vanquished
foes
perhaps
such
measures
were
necessary
and
the
harshness
with
which
he
repressed
insurrection
prevented
more
frequent
outbreaks
and
so
averted
greater
sacrifice
of
life
but
the
horror
of
these
scenes
so
appals
the
modern
reader
that
at
first
he
can
only
regard
as
a
royal
butcher
of
the
worst
type

studies

as
its
identity
with
the
ararat
of
the

the

of

it
was
also
generally
recognised
that
the
name
biainas
in
the
vannic
inscriptions
which
hincks
read

corresponded
to
the
urartu
of
the
assyrians

this
mistaken
reading
efforts
have
been
made

connect
it

not
a
secondary
form

afraid

approached
quite
close

he
preferred
to
check

to
have

at

under

a
certain
sharduris

about

to
have
passed

himself
king

ambition
may
have

forced
to
take
up

dependence
he
intended
to
exercise
effective
control
over
all
the

however

shalmaneser
had
destroyed

laid

confirmed
the
tributary
states
of
syria
in
their
allegiance
but
damascus
and
babylon
were
as
yet
untouched
and
the
moment
was
at
hand
when
he
would
have
to
choose
between
an
arduous
conflict
with
them
or
such
a
repression
of
the
warlike
zeal
of
his
opening
years
that
like
his
father
he
would
have
to
repose
on
his
laurels
shalmaneser
was
too
deeply
imbued
with
the
desire
for
conquest
to
choose
a
peaceful
policy
he
decided
at
once
to
assume
the
offensive
against
damascus
being
probably
influenced
by
the
news
of
successes
and
deeming
that
if
the
king
of
israel
had
gained
the
ascendency
unaided
assur
fully
confident
of
its
own
superiority
need
have
no
fear
as
to
the
result
of
a
conflict
the
forces
however
at
the
disposal
of
benhadad
ii
adadidri
were
sufficient
to
cause
the
assyrians
some
uneasiness
the
king
of
damascus
was
not
only
lord
of
and
the
haurân
but
he
exercised
a
suzerainty
more
or
less
defined
over
hamath

their

provide

an

proved
by
the
way
in

that

lie

it

demonstrated
the
power
of

eyes

the
most
incredulous
and
proved
how
easy
resistance
would
be
if
only
the
various
princes
of
syria
would
lay
aside
their
differences
and
all
unite
under
the
command
of
a
single
chief
the
effect
of
the
battle
in
northern
syria
and
among
the
recently
annexed

was
very
great
they
began

shalmaneser
spent
a

in

moreover
arose
at

which
obliged
him
to
concentrate
his
attention
and
energy
on
chaldæan
affairs
had
always
maintained
peaceful
and
friendly
relations
with
assyria
but
he
had
been
overthrown

so
much
of

country
that

fears
for

itself
he
then
probably
remembered
the
pretensions
to
kharduniash
which
his
assyrian
neighbours
had
for
a
long
time
maintained
and
applied
to
shalmaneser
to
support
his
tottering
fortunes
the
assyrian
monarch
must
have
been
disposed
to
lend
a
favourable
ear
to
a
request
which
allowed
him
to
intervene
as
suzerain
in
the
quarrels
of
the
rival

he
mobilised
his
forces

sacrifices
in

at

and
crossed
the
frontier
in
the

dragged
on
during
the
next
two

the
scene
of

was
at

outset

for

had
served

probably
near

perhaps
we
may
identify
it
with
the

gananatê

be
sought
higher
up

as
the
context
points
out
i

inclined
to
place
it
near
the
site
of
khanekin
whose
gardens
are
still
celebrated
and
the
strategic
importance
of
which
is
considerable
vacillating
king
incapable
of
directing
his
own
affairs
came
out
to
meet
him
but
although
repulsed
and
driven
within
the
town
he
defended
his
position
with
such
spirit
that

was
at
length
obliged
to
draw
off
his
troops
after
having
cut
down
all
the
young

after

effected

the
damage
he
could

the
most
direct

into

hands

having
no
heart

from

not
do

in
placing

either
at

in

the

they

had
refused
him
their
allegiance
and
were
ravaging
the
regions
of
the
lower
euphrates
by
their
repeated
incursions
they
constituted
not
so
much
a
compact
state
as
a
confederation
of
little
states
alternately
involved
in
petty
internecine
quarrels
or
temporarily
reconciled
under
the
precarious
authority
of
a
sole
monarch
each
separate
state

the
name
of
the
head
of
the
family
real
or
mythical
from
whom
all
its
members
prided
themselves
on
being
descended
and
finally
which
in
the
end
asserted
its
predominance
over
all
the
rest
as
far
as
we
can
judge
and
were
the

the

the

gulf
in
demanding
help
had
virtually
thrown
on
him
the
responsibility
of
bringing
these
turbulent
subjects
to
order
and
the
assyrian
monarch
accepted
the
duties
of
his
new
position
without
demur
he
marched
to
babylon
entered
the
city
and
went
direct
to
the
temple
of
the
people
beheld
him
approach
with
reverence
their
deities
bel
and
belît
and
visit
all
the
sanctuaries
of
the
local
gods
to
whom
he
made
endless
propitiatory
libations
and
pure
offerings
he
had
worshipped
ninip
in
kuta
he
was
careful
not
to
forget
nabo
of
borsippa
while
on
the
other
hand
he
officiated
in
the
temple
of
ezida
and
consulted
its
ancient
oracle
offering
upon
its
altars
the
flesh
of
splendid
oxen
and
fat
lambs
the
inhabitants
had
their
part
in
the
festival
as
well
as
the
gods
shalmaneser
summoned
them
to
a
public
banquet
at
which
he
distributed
to
them
embroidered
garments
and
plied
them
with
meats
and
wine
then
after
renewing
his
homage
to
the
gods
of
babylon
he
recommenced
his
campaign
and
set
out
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
baqâni
the
first
of
the
chaldæan
cities
which
lay
on
his
route
belonged
to
one
of
the
tribes
of
it
appeared
disposed
to
resist
him
and
was
therefore
promptly
dismantled
and
burnt
an
example
which
did
not
fail
to
cool
the
warlike
inclinations
which
had
begun
to
manifest
themselves
in
other
parts
of
the
site
of
baqâni
is
unknown
it
should
be
sought
for
between
lamlum
and
warka
and
in
should
be
placed
between
the
and
the
arabian
desert
if
the
name
of
enzudî
the
other
royal
town
situated
to
the
west
of
the
euphrates
is
found
as
is
possible
under
a
popular
etymology
in
that
of
kalaat
saîd
or
kalaat
in
the
modern
maps
he
next
crossed
the
euphrates
and
pillaged
enzudî
the
fate
of
which
caused
the
remainder
of
to
lay
down
arms
and
the
submission
of
the
latter
brought
about
that
of
and
these
were
all
rich
provinces
and
they
bought
off
the
conqueror
liberally
gold
silver
tin
copper
iron
ivory
skins
were
all
showered
upon
the
invader
to
secure
his
mercy
it
must
have
been
an
intense
satisfaction
to
the
pride
of
the
assyrians
to
be
able
to
boast
that
their
king
had
deigned
to
offer
sacrifices
in
the
sacred
cities
of
accad
and
that
he
had
been
borne
by
his
to
the
shores
of
the
salt
sea
these
facts
of
little
moment
to
us
now
appeared
to
the
people
of
those
days
of
decisive
importance
no
king
who
was
not
actually
master
of
the
country
would
have
been
tolerated
within
the
temple
of
the
eponymous
god
for
the
purpose
of
celebrating
the
rites
which
the
sovereign
alone
was
empowered
to
perform
in
recognising
right
to
act
thus
thereby
acknowledged
that
he
himself
was
not
only
the
ally
but
his
liegeman
this
bond
of
supremacy
doubtless
did
not
weigh
heavily
upon
him
as
soon
as
his
suzerain
had
evacuated
the
country
the
two
kingdoms
remained
much
on
the
same
footing
as
had
been
established
by
the
treaties
of
the
three
previous
generations
alliances
were
made
between
private
families
belonging
to
both
peace
existed
between
the
two
sovereigns
interchange
of
commerce
and
amenities
took
place
between
the
two
peoples
but
with
one
point
of
difference
which
had
not
existed
formerly
assur
protected
babel
and
by
taking
precedence
of
marduk
he
became
the
real
head
of
the
peoples
of
the
euphrates
valley
assured
of
the
subordination
or
at
least
of
the
friendly
neutrality
of
babylon
had
now
a
free
hand
to
undertake
a
campaign
in
the
remoter
regions
of
syria
without
being
constantly
haunted
by
the
fear
that
his
rival
might
suddenly
swoop
down
upon
him
in
the
rear
by
the
valleys
of
the
badanu
or
the
zabs
he
now
ran
no
risks
in
withdrawing
his
troops
from
the
frontier
and
in
marshalling
his
forces
on
the
slopes
of
the
armenian
alps
or
on
the
banks
of
the
orontes
leaving
merely
a
slender
contingent
in
the
heart
of
assyria
proper
to
act
as
the
necessary
guardians
of
order
in
the
capital
since
the
indecisive
battle
of
qarqar
the
western
frontier
of
the
empire
had
receded
as
far
as
the
euphrates
and
shalmaneser
had
been
obliged
to
forego
the
collection
of
the
annual
syrian
tribute
it
would
have
been
an
excellent
opportunity
for
the
khâti
while
they
enjoyed
this
accidental
respite
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
damascus
for
the
purpose
of
acting
conjointly
against
a
common
enemy
but
they
let
the
right
moment
slip
and
their
isolation
made
submission
inevitable
the
effort
to
subdue
them
cost
shalmaneser
dear
both
in
time
and
men
in
the
spring
of
each
year
he
appeared
at
the
fords
of
and
ravaged
the
environs
of
carchemish
then
marched
upon
the
orontes
to
accomplish
the
systematic
devastation
of
some
fresh
district
or
to
inflict
a
defeat
on
such
of
his
adversaries
as
dared
to
encounter
him
in
the
open
field
in
the
first
blow
was
struck
at
the
khâti
was
the
next
to
suffer
and
its
king
aramê
lost
arniê
his
royal
city
with
some
hundred
more
townships
and
strongholds
historians
have
up
to
the
present
admitted
that
this
campaign
of
the
year
took
place
in
armenia
the
context
of
the
account
itself
shows
us
that
in
his
tenth
year
shalmaneser
advanced
against
the
towns
of
aramê
immediately
after
having
pillaged
the
country
of
the
khâti
which
inclines
me
to
think
that
these
towns
were
situated
in
northern
syria
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
aramê
in
question
is
not
the
armenian
king
of
that
name
but
aramê
the
sovereign
of
who
is
named
several
times
in
the
annals
of
shalmaneser
the
text
of
bull
no
adds
to
the
account
of
the
war
against
aramê
that
of
a
war
against
the
damascene
league
which
merely
repeats
the
account
of
eleventh
year
it
is
generally
admitted
that
the
war
against
aramê
falls
under
his
tenth
year
and
the
war
against
during
his
eleventh
year
the
scribes
must
have
had
at
their
disposal
two
different
versions
of
one
document
in
which
these
two
wars
were
described
without
distinction
of
year
the
compiler
of
the
inscription
of
the
bulls
would
have
considered
them
as
forming
two
distinct
accounts
which
he
has
placed
one
after
the
other
in
it
was
the
turn
of
damascus
the
league
of
which
had
proclaimed
himself
the
suzerain
was
still
in
existence
but
it
had
recently
narrowly
escaped
dissolution
and
a
revolt
had
almost
deprived
it
of
the
adherence
of
israel
and
the
house
of
omri
after
hamath
the
most
active
of
all
its
members
the
losses
suffered
at
qarqar
had
doubtless
been
severe
enough
to
shake
faith
in
the
strength
of
his
master
and
ally
besides
this
it
would
appear
that
the
latter
had
not
honourably
fulfilled
all
the
conditions
of
the
treaty
of
peace
he
had
signed
three
years
previously
he
still
held
the
important
fortress
of
and
he
delayed
handing
it
over
to
ahab
in
spite
of
his
oath
to
restore
it
finding
that
he
could
not
regain
possession
of
it
by
fair
means
ahab
resolved
to
take
it
by
force
a
great
change
in
feeling
and
politics
had
taken
place
at
jerusalem
jehoshaphat
who
occupied
the
throne
was
like
his
father
asa
a
devout
worshipper
of
jahveh
but
his
piety
did
not
blind
him
to
the
secular
needs
of
the
moment
the
experience
of
his
predecessors
had
shown
that
the
union
of
the
twelve
tribes
under
the
rule
of
a
scion
of
judah
was
a
thing
of
the
past
for
ever
all
attempts
to
restore
it
had
ended
in
failure
and
bloodshed
and
the
house
of
david
had
again
only
lately
been
saved
from
ruin
by
the
dearly
bought
intervention
of
and
his
syrians
jehoshaphat
from
the
outset
clearly
saw
the
necessity
of
avoiding
these
errors
of
the
past
he
accepted
the
situation
and
sought
the
friendship
of
israel
an
alliance
between
two
princes
so
unequal
in
power
could
only
result
in
a
disguised
suzerainty
for
one
of
them
and
a
state
of
vassalage
for
the
other
what
alliance
was
to
ahab
that
of
ahab
was
to
jehoshaphat
and
it
served
his
purpose
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
the
the
strained
relations
between
the
two
countries
were
relaxed
and
the
severed
tribes
on
both
sides
of
the
frontier
set
about
repairing
their
losses
while
hiel
the
bethelite
at
length
set
about
rebuilding
jericho
on
behalf
of
samaria
jehoshaphat
was
collecting
around
him
a
large
army
and
strengthening
himself
on
the
west
against
the
philistines
and
on
the
south
against
the
bedawîn
of
the
desert
the
marriage
of
his
eldest
son
with
athaliah
subsequently
bound
the
two
courts
together
by
still
closer
ties
were
exchanged
and
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
a
stay
made
by
jehoshaphat
at
jezreel
that
the
expedition
against
eamoth
was
finally
resolved
on
the
subordinate
position
of
jehoshaphat
is
clearly
indicated
by
the
reply
which
he
makes
to
ahab
when
the
latter
asks
him
to
accompany
him
on
this
expedition

as
thou
art
my
people
as
thy
people

cf

and
several
authors
prefer
the
latter
filiation
while
the
majority
see
in
it
a
mistake
of
the
hebrew
scribe
it
is
possible
that
both
attributions
may
be
correct
for
we
see
by
the
assyrian
inscriptions
that
a
sovereign
is
called
the
son
of
the
founder
of
his
line
even
when
he
was
several
generations
removed
from
him
thus
the
adversary
of
sargon
of
assyria
calls
himself
son
of
iakin
although
the
founder
of
the
had
been
dead
many
centuries
before
his
accession
the
document
used
in
kings
viii
may
have
employed
the
term
daughter
of
omri
in
the
same
manner
merely
to
indicate
that
the
queen
of
jerusalem
belonged
to
the
house
of
omri
it
might
well
have
appeared
a
more
than
foolhardy
enterprise
and
it
was
told
in
israel
that
micaiah
a
prophet
the
son
of
imlah
had
predicted
its
disastrous
ending
saw
exclaimed
the
prophet
lord
sitting
on
his
throne
and
all
the
host
of
heaven
standing
on
his
right
hand
and
on
his
left
and
the
lord
said
who
shall
entice
ahab
that
he
may
go
up
and
fall
at
and
one
said
on
this
manner
and
another
said
on
that
manner
and
there
came
forth
a
spirit
and
stood
before
the
lord
and
said
i
will
entice
him
and
the
lord
said
unto
him
wherewith
and
he
said
i
will
go
forth
and
will
be
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
his
prophets
and
he
said
thou
shalt
entice
him
and
shalt
prevail
also
go
forth
and
do
so
now
therefore
behold
the
lord
hafch
put
a
lying
spirit
in
the
mouth
of
all
these
thy
prophets
and
the
lord
hath
spoken
evil
concerning
kings
xxii
reproduced
in
chron
xviii
the
two
kings
thereupon
invested
ramoth
and
hastened
to
the
defence
of
his
fortress
selecting
of
his
bravest
charioteers
he
commanded
them
to
single
out
ahab
only
for
attack
and
not
fight
with
others
until
they
had
slain
him
this
injunction
happened
in
some
way
to
come
to
the
ears
and
he
therefore
disguised
himself
as
a
common
soldier
while
jehoshaphat
retained
his
ordinary
dress
attracted
by
the
richness
of
the
armour
the
syrians
fell
upon
him
but
on
his
raising
his
they
perceived
their
mistake
and
turning
from
the
king
of
judah
they
renewed
their
quest
of
the
israelitish
leader
while
they
were
vainly
seeking
him
an
archer
drew
a
bow
a
venture
and
pierced
him
in
the
joints
of
his
cuirass
he
said
to
his
charioteer
turn
thine
hand
and
carry
me
out
of
the
host
for
i
am
sore
perceiving
however
that
the
battle
was
going
against
him

revoked
the
order
and
remained
on
the
field

to

man
to
his
country
the
followers
bore
his
body
to

again
relapsed
into
the
position
of
a
vassal
probably
under
the
same
conditions
as
before
the

kings
xxii
cf
ohron
xviii
with
interpolations
in
verses
and
it
is
impossible
to
establish
the
chronology
of
this
period
with
any
certainty
so
entirely
do
the
hebrew
accounts
of
it
differ
from
the
assyrian
the
latter
mention
ahab
as
alive
at
the
time
of
the
battle
of
qarqar
in
and
jehu
on
the
throne
in
we
must
therefore
place
in
the
intervening
twelve
years
first
the
end
of
reign
secondly
the
two
years
of
ahaziah
thirdly
the
twelve
years
of
joram
fourthly
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
jehu
in
all
possibly
fourteen
years
the
reign
of
joram
has
been
prolonged
beyond
reason
by
the
hebrew
annalists
and
it
alone
lends
itself
to
be
curtailed
admitting
that
the
siege
of
samaria
preceded
the
battle
of
qarqar
we
may
surmise
that
the
three
years
which
elapsed
according
to
the
tradition
kings
xxii
between
the
triumph
of
ahab
and
his
death
fall
into
two
unequal
periods
two
previous
to
qarqar
and
one
after
it
in
such
a
manner
that
the
revolt
of
israel
would
have
been
the
result
of
the
defeat
of
the
damascenes
ahab
must
have
died
in
as
most
modern
historians
agree
on
the
other
hand
it
is
scarcely
probable
that
jehu
ascended
the
throne
at
the
very
moment
that
shalmaneser
was
defeating
hazael
in
we
can
only
carry
back
his
accession
to
the
preceding
year
possibly
the
duration
of
two
years
for
the
reign
of
ahaziah
can
only
be
reduced
by
a
few
months
if
indeed
as
much
as
that
as
it
allows
of
a
full
year
and
part
of
a
second
year
cf
kings
xxii
where
it
is
said
that
ahaziah
ascended
the
throne
in
the
year
of
jehoshaphat
and
kings
iii
where
it
states
that
joram
of
israel
succeeded
ahaziah
in
the
year
of
the
same
jehoshaphat
in
placing
these
two
years
between
and
there
will
remain
for
the
reign
of
joram
the
period
comprised
between
and
namely
eight
years
instead
of
the
twelve
attributed
to
him
by
biblical
tradition
ahaziah
survived
his
father
two
years
and
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
joram
when
shalmaneser
in
reappeared
in
the
valley
of
the
orontes
joram
sent
out
against
him
his
prescribed
contingent
and
the
conquered
israelites
once
more
fought
for
their
conqueror
the
hebrew
documents
merely
make
mention
of
accession
length
of
reign
and
death
kings
xxii
and
kings
i
the
assyrian
texts
do
not
mention
his
name
but
they
state
that
in
twelve
fought
against
shalmaneser
and
as
we
have
already
seen
one
of
the
twelve
was
king
of
israel
here
therefore
necessarily
ahaziah
whose
successor
was
joram
the
assyrians
had
as
usual
maltreated
the
khâti
after
having
pillaged
the
towns
of
carchemish
and
agusi
they
advanced
on
the
amanos
held
to
ransom
the
territory
of
the
patina
enclosed
within
the
bend
of
the
orontes
and
descending
upon
hamath
by
way
of
the
districts
of
iaraku
and
they
came
into
conflict
with
the
army
of
the
twelve
kings
though
on
this
occasion
the
contest
was
so
bloody
that
they
were
forced
to
withdraw
immediately
after
their
success
they
had
to
content
themselves
with
sacking
apparazu
one
of
the
citadels
of
aramê
and
with
collecting
the
tribute
of
garparuda
of
the
patina
which
done
they
skirted
the
amanos
and
provided
themselves
with
beams
from
its
cedars
the
two
following
years
were
spent
in
harrying
the
people
of
paqarakhbuni
on
the
right
bank
of
the
euphrates
in
the
dependencies
of
the
ancient
kingdom
of
adini
and
in
plundering
the
inhabitants
of
ishtaratê
in
the
country
of
iaîti
near
the
sources
of
the
tigris
till
in
they
returned
to
try
their
fortune
again
in
syria
they
transported
men
across
the
euphrates
hoping
perhaps
by
the
mere
mass
of
such
a
force
to
crush
their
enemy
in
a
single
battle
but
was
supported
by
his
vassals
and
their
combined
army
must
have
been
as
formidable
numerically
as
that
of
the
assyrians
as
usual
after
the
engagement
shalmaneser
claimed
the
victory
but
he
did
not
succeed
in
intimidating
the
allies
or
in
wresting
from
them
a
single
rood
of
territory
the
care
which
the
king
takes
to
specify
that
men
he
crossed
the
euphrates
in
very
probably
shows
that
this
number
was
for
him
in
some
respects
an
unusual
one
discouraged
doubtless
by
so
many
fruitless
attempts
he
decided
to
suspend
hostilities
at
all
events
for
the
present
in
he
visited
naîri
and
caused
an
of
his
royal
to
be
carved
at
the
source
of
the
tigris
close
to
the
very
spot
where
the
stream
first
rises
pushing
forward
through
the
defiles
of
tunibuni
he
next
invaded
urartu
and
devastated
it
as
far
as
the
sources
of
the
euphrates
on
reaching
these
he
purified
his
arms
in
the
virgin
spring
and
offered
a
sacrifice
to
the
gods
on
his
return
to
the
frontier
the
chief
of
dayaini
his
feet
and
presented
him
with
some
thoroughbred
horses
in
he
crossed
the
lower
zab
and
plunged
into

heart

namri

country

long
been
under
babylonian
influence

its
princes
bore

was
then
its
ruler
betook
himself
to
the
mountains
to
preserve
his
life
but
his
treasures
idols
and
troops
were
carried
off
to
assyria
and
he
was
superseded
on
the
throne
by
ianzu
the
son
of
khambân
a
noble
of
cossæan
origin
as
might
be
expected
after
such
severe
exertions
shalmaneser
apparently
felt
that
he
deserved
a
time
of
repose
for
his
chroniclers
merely
note
the
date
of
as
that
of
an
inspection
terminating
in
a
felling
of
cedars
in
the
amanos
as
a
fact
there
was
nothing
stirring
on
the
frontier
chaldæa
itself
looked
upon
him
as
a
benefactor
almost
as
a
suzerain
and
by
its
position
between
elam
and
assyria
protected
the
latter
from
any
quarrel
with
susa
the
nations
on
the
east
continued
to
pay
their
tribute
without
coercion
and
namri
which
alone
entertained
pretensions
to
independence
had
just
received
a
severe
lesson
urartu
had
not
acknowledged
the
supremacy
of
assur
but
it
had
suffered
in
the
last
invasion
and
aramê
had
shown
no
further
sign
of
hostility
the
tribes
of
the
upper
tigris
kummukh
and
adini
accepted
their
position
as
subjects
and
any
trouble
arising
in
that
quarter
was
treated
as
merely
an
ebullition
of
local
dissatisfaction
and
was
promptly
crushed
the
khâti
were
exhausted
by
the
systematic
destruction
of
their
towns
and
their
harvests
lastly
of
the
principalities
of
the
amanos
gurgum
samalla
and
the
patina
if
some
had
occasionally
taken
part
in
the
struggles
for
independence
the
others
had
always
remained
faithful
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
as
vassals
damascus
alone
held
out
and
the
valour
with
which
she
had
endured
all
the
attacks
made
on
her
showed
no
signs
of
abatement
unless
any
internal
disturbance
arose
to
diminish
her
strength
she
was
likely
to
be
able
to
resist
the
growing
power
of
assyria
for
a
long
time
to
come
it
was
at
the
very
time
when
her
supremacy
appeared
to
be
thus
firmly
established
that
a
revolution
broke
out
the
effects
of
which
soon
undid
the
work
of
the
preceding
two
or
three
generations
disembarrassed
of
shalmaneser
desired
to
profit
by
the
respite
thus
gained
to
make
a
final
reckoning
with
the
israelites
it
would
appear
that
their
fortune
had
been
on
the
wane
ever
since
the
heroic
death
of
ahab
immediately
after
the
disaster
at
eamoth
the
moabites
had
risen
against
ahaziah
and
their
king
mesha
son
of
kamoshgad
had
seized
the
territory
north
of
the
arnon
which
belonged
to
the
tribe
of
gad
he
had
either
killed
or
carried
away
the
jewish
population
in
order
to
colonise
the
district
with
moabites
and
he
had
then
fortified
most
of
the
towns
beginning
with
dhibon
his
capital
owing
to
the
shortness
of
his
reign
ahaziah
had
been
unable
to
take
measures
to
hinder
him
but
joram
as
soon
as
he
was
firmly
seated
on
the
throne
made
every
effort
to
regain
possession
of
his
province
and
claimed
the
help
of
his
ally
or
vassal
jehoshaphat
kings
iii
the
text
does
not
name
ahaziah
and
it
might
be
concluded
that
the
revolt
took
place
under
joram
the
expression
employed
by
the
hebrew
writer
however
ahab
was
dead
the
king
of
moab
rebelled
against
the
king
of
israel
does
not
permit
of
it
being
placed
otherwise
than
at
the
opening
of
reign
kings
iii
where
jehoshaphat
replies
to
joram
in
the
same
terms
which
he
had
used
to
ahab
the
chronological
difficulties
induced
ed
meyer
to
replace
the
name
of
jehoshaphat
in
this
passage
by
that
of
his
son
jehoram
as
stade
has
remarked
the
presence
of
two
kings
both
bearing
the
name
of
jehoram
in
the
same
campaign
against
moab
would
have
been
one
of
those
facts
which
strike
the
popular
imagination
and
would
not
have
been
forgotten
if
the
hebrew
author
has
connected
the
moabite
war
with
the
name
of
jehoshaphat
it
is
because
his
sources
of
information
furnished
him
with
that
name
the
latter
had
done
his
best
to
repair
the
losses
caused
by
the
war
with
syria
being
lord
of
edom
he
had
been
tempted
to
follow
the
example
of
solomon
and
the
deputy
who
commanded
in
his
name
had
constructed
a
vessel
at
go
to
ophir
for
gold
but
the
vessel
was
wrecked
before
quitting
the
port
and
the
disaster
was
regarded
by
the
king
as
a
punishment
from
jahveh
for
when
ahaziah
suggested
that
the
enterprise
should
be
renewed
at
their
joint
expense
he
refused
the
offer
but
the
sudden
insurrection
of
moab
threatened
him
as
much
as
it
did
joram
and
he
gladly
acceded
to
the
appeal
for
help
both
in
the
hebrew
and
the
septuagint
the
ships
are
in
the
plural
number
in
kings
xxii
tr
kings
xxii
where
the
hebrew
writer
calls
the
vessel
constructed
by
jehoshaphat
a
of
tarshish
that
is
a
vessel
built
to
make
long
voyages
the
author
of
the
chronicles
thought
that
the
jewish
expedition
to
geber
on
the
red
sea
was
destined
to
go
to
tarshish
in
spain
he
has
moreover
transformed
the
vessel
into
a
fleet
and
has
associated
ahaziah
in
the
enterprise
contrary
to
the
testimony
of
the
book
of
kings
finally
he
has
introduced
into
the
account
a
prophet
named
eliezer
who
represents
the
disaster
as
a
chastisement
for
the
alliance
with
ahaziah
ghron
xx
apparently
the
simplest
way
of
approaching
the
enemy
would
have
been
from
the
north
choosing
gilead
as
a
base
of
operations
but
the
line
of
fortresses
constructed
by
mesha
at
this
vulnerable
point
of
his
frontier
was
so
formidable
that
the
allies
resolved
to
attack
from
the
south
after
passing
the
lower
extremity
of
the
dead
sea
they
marched
for
seven
days
in
an
arid
desert
digging
wells
as
they
proceeded
for
the
necessary
supply
of
water
mesha
awaited
them
with
his
hastily
assembled
troops
on
the
confines
of
the
cultivated
land
the
allies
routed
him
and
blockaded
him
within
his
city
of
closely
beset
and
despairing
of
any
help
from
man
he
had
recourse
to
the
last
resource
which
religion
provided
for
his
salvation
taking
his
firstborn
son
he
offered
him
to
chemosh
and
burnt
him
on
the
city
wall
in
sight
of
the
besiegers
the
israelites
knew
what
obligations
this
sacrifice
entailed
upon
the
moabite
god
and
the
succour
which
he
would
be
constrained
to
give
to
his
devotees
in
consequence
they
therefore
raised
the
siege
and
disbanded
in
all
directions
mesha
delivered
at
the
very
moment
that
his
cause
seemed
hopeless
dedicated
a
stele
in
the
temple
of
dhibôn
on
which
he
recorded
his
victories
and
related
what
measures
he
had
taken
to
protect
his
people
or
is
the
present
kcrak
the
krak
of
mediaeval
times
the
account
of
the
campaign
kings
iii
belongs
to
the
prophetic
cycle
of
elisha
and
seems
to
give
merely
a
popular
version
of
the
event
a
king
of
edom
is
mentioned
while
elsewhere
under
jehoshaphat
it
is
stated
was
no
king
in
kings
xxii
the
geography
also
of
the
route
taken
by
the
expedition
is
somewhat
confused
finally
the
account
of
the
siege
of
hareseth
is
mutilated
and
the
compiler
has
abridged
the
episode
of
the
human
sacrifice
as
being
too
conducive
to
the
honour
of
chemosh
and
to
the
dishonour
of
jahveh
the
main
facts
of
the
account
are
correct
but
the
details
are
not
clear
and
do
not
all
bear
the
stamp
of
veracity
this
is
the
famous
moabite
stone
or
stele
of
dhibôn
discovered
by
in
and
now
preserved
in
the
louvre
illustration
the
moabite
stone
of
stele
of
mesha
from
a
photograph
by
retouched
by
massias
from
the
original
in
the
louvre
the
fainter
parts
of
the
stele
are
the
portions
restored
in
the
original
he
still
feared
a
repetition
of
the
invasion
but
this
misfortune
was
spared
him
jehoshaphat
was
gathered
to
his
fathers
and
his
edomite
subjects
revolted
on
receiving
the
news
of
his
death
jeho
his
son
and
successor
at
once
took
up
arms
to
bring
them
to
a
sense
of
their
duty
but
they
surrounded
his
camp
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
cut
his
way
through
their
ranks
and
escaped
during
the
night
the
date
of
the
death
of
jehoshaphat
may
be
fixed
as
or
the
biblical
documents
give
us
for
the
period
of
the
history
of
judah
following
on
the
death
of
ahab
first
eight
years
of
jehoshaphat
from
the
year
of
his
reign
kings
xxii
to
his
and
last
year
kings
xxii
secondly
eight
years
of
jehoram
son
of
jehoshaphat
kings
viii
thirdly
one
year
of
ahaziah
son
of
jehoram
kings
viii
in
all
years
which
must
be
reduced
and
condensed
into
the
period
between
the
probable
date
of
the
battle
of
ramoth
and
the
equally
probable
date
of
the
accession
of
jehu
the
reigns
of
the
two
ahaziahs
are
too
short
to
be
further
abridged
we
must
therefore
place
the
campaign
against
moab
at
the
earliest
in
during
the
months
which
followed
the
accession
of
joram
of
israel
and
lengthen
reign
from
to
there
will
then
be
room
between
and
for
five
years
instead
of
eight
for
the
reign
of
jehoram
of
judah
the
defection
of
the
old
canaanite
city
of
libnah
followed
quickly
on
this
reverse
and
jehoram
was
powerless
to
avenge
himself
on
it
the
philistines
and
the
bedâwin
having
threatened
the
western
part
of
his
territory
and
raided
the
country
in
the
midst
of
these
calamities
judah
had
no
leisure
to
take
further
measures
against
mesha
and
israel
itself
had
suffered
too
severe
a
blow
to
attempt
retaliation
the
advanced
age
of
and
the
unsatisfactory
result
of
the
campaigns
against
shalmaneser
had
furnished
joram
with
an
occasion
for
a
rupture
with
damascus
war
dragged
on
for
some
time
apparently
till
the
tide
of
fortune
turned
against
joram
and
like
his
father
ahab
in
similar
circumstances
he
shut
himself
within
samaria
where
the
false
alarm
of
an
egyptian
or
hittite
invasion
produced
a
panic
in
the
syrian
camp
and
restored
the
fortunes
of
the
israelitish
king
kings
viii
cf
ghron
xxi
this
war
is
mentioned
only
in
ghron
xxi
where
it
is
represented
as
a
chastisement
from
jahveh
the
philistines
and
arabs
which
are
beside
the
kush
seem
to
have
taken
jerusalem
pillaged
the
palace
and
carried
away
the
wives
and
children
of
the
king
into
captivity
that
there
was
never
a
son
left
him
save
jehoahaz
ahaziah
the
youngest
of
his
kuenen
has
proposed
to
take
the
whole
account
of
the
reign
of
joram
son
of
ahab
and
transfer
it
to
that
of
jehoahaz
son
of
jehu
and
this
theory
has
been
approved
by
several
recent
critics
and
historians
on
the
other
hand
some
have
desired
to
connect
it
with
the
account
of
the
siege
of
samaria
in
reign
i
fail
to
see
any
reasonable
argument
which
can
be
brought
against
the
authenticity
of
the
main
fact
whatever
opinion
may
be
held
with
regard
to
the
details
of
the
biblical
narrative
did
not
long
survive
the
reverse
he
had
experienced
he
returned
sick
and
at
the
point
of
death
to
damascus
where
he
was
assassinated
by
hazael
one
of
his
captains
hebrew
tradition
points
to
the
influence
of
the
prophets
in
all
these
events
the
aged
elijah
had
disappeared
so
ran
the
story
caught
up
to
heaven
in
a
chariot
of
fire
but
his
mantle
had
fallen
on
elisha
and
his
power
still
survived
in
his
disciple
from
far
and
near
counsel
was
sought
alike
by
gentiles
as
by
the
followers
of
the
true
god
whether
the
suppliant
was
the
weeping
shunamite
mourning
for
the
loss
of
her
only
son
or
naaman
the
captain
of
the
damascene
chariotry
he
granted
their
petitions
and
raised
the
child
from
its
bed
and
healed
the
soldier
of
his
leprosy
during
the
siege
of
samaria
he
had
several
times
frustrated
the
designs
and
had
predicted
to
joram
not
only
the
fact
but
the
hour
of
deliverance
and
the
circumstances
which
would
accompany
it
had
sent
hazael
to
the
prophet
to
ask
him
if
he
should
recover
and
elisha
had
wept
on
seeing
the
envoy
i
know
the
evil
that
thou
wilt
do
unto
the
children
of
israel
their
strongholds
wilt
thou
set
on
fire
and
their
young
men
wilt
thou
slay
with
the
sword
and
wilt
dash
in
pieces
their
little
ones
and
rip
up
their
women
with
child
and
hazael
said
but
what
is
thy
servant
which
is
but
a
dog
that
he
should
do
this
great
thing
and
elisha
answered
the
lord
hath
showed
me
that
thou
shalt
be
king
over
on
returning
to
damascus
hazael
gave
the
results
of
his
mission
in
a
reassuring
manner
to
but
the
morrow
he
took
the
coverlet
and
dipped
it
in
water
and
spread
it
on
his
face
so
that
he
the
deed
which
deprived
it
of
its
seriously
affected
damascus
itself
it
was
to
that
it
owed
most
of
its
prosperity
he
it
was
who
had
humiliated
hamath
and
the
princes
of
the
coast
of
arvad
and
the
nomads
of
the
arabian
desert
he
had
witnessed
the
rise
of
the
most
energetic
of
all
the
israelite
dynasties
and
he
had
curbed
its
ambition
omri
had
been
forced
to
pay
him
tribute
ahab
ahaziah
and
joram
had
continued
it
and
suzerainty
recognised
more
or
less
by
their
vassals
had
extended
through
moab
and
judah
as
far
as
the
bed
sea
not
only
had
he
skilfully
built
up
this
fabric
of
vassal
states
which
made
him
lord
of
of
syria
but
he
had
been
able
to
preserve
it
unshaken
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
spite
of
rebellions
in
several
of
his
fiefs
and
reiterated
attacks
from
assyria
shalmaneser
indeed
had
made
an
attack
on
his
line
but
without
breaking
through
it
and
had
at
length
left
him
master
of
the
field
this
superiority
however
which
no
reverse
could
shake
lay
in
himself
and
in
himself
alone
no
sooner
had
he
passed
away
than
it
suddenly
ceased
and
hazael
found
himself
restricted
from
the
very
outset
to
the
territory
of
damascus
proper
hamath
arvad
and
the
northern
peoples
deserted
the
league
to
return
to
it
no
more
joram
of
israel
called
on
his
nephew
ahaziah
who
had
just
succeeded
to
jehoram
of
judah
and
both
together
marched
to
besiege
bamoth
from
this
point
onward
the
assyrian
texts
which
mentioned
twelve
kings
of
the
irkhulini
of
hamath
and
adadidri
of
damascus

not
successful
in
their
methods
of
carrying
on

joram
wounded
in
a
skirmish
retired
to
his
palace
at
jezreel
where
ahaziah
joined
him
a
few
days
later
on
the
pretext
of
inquiring
after
his
welfare
the
prophets
of
both
kingdoms
and
their
followers
had
never
forgiven
the
family
of
ahab
their
extraction
nor
their
eclecticism
in
the
matter
of
religion
they
had
numerous
partisans
in
both
armies
and
a
conspiracy
was
set
on
foot
against
the
absent
sovereigns
elisha
judging
the
occasion
to
be
a
propitious
one
despatched
one
of
his
disciples
to
the
camp
with
secret
instructions
the
generals
were
all
present
at
a
banquet
when
the
messenger
arrived
he
took
one
of
them
jehu
the
son
of
nimshi
on
one
side
anointed
him
and
then
escaped
jehu
returned
and
seated
himself
amongst
his
who
unsuspicious
of
what
had
happened
questioned
him
as
to
the
errand
all
well
wherefore
came
this
mad
fellow
to
thee
and
he
said
unto
them
ye
know
the
man
and
what
his
talk
was
and
they
said
it
is
false
tell
us
now
and
he
said
thus
and
thus
spake
he
to
me
saying
thus
saith
the
lord
i
have
anointed
thee
king
over
israel
then
they
hasted
and
took
every
man
his
garment
and
put
it
under
him
on
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
blew
the
trumpet
saying
jehu
is
he
at
once
marched
on
jezreel
and
the
two
kings
surprised
at
this
movement
went
out
to
meet
him
with
scarcely
any
escort
the
two
parties
had
hardly
met
when
joram
asked
it
peace
jehu
to
which
jehu
replied
peace
so
long
as
the
whoredoms
of
thy
mother
jezebel
and
her
witchcrafts
are
so
many
whereupon
joram
turned
rein
crying
to
his
nephew
is
treachery
o
but
an
arrow
pierced
him
through
the
heart
and
he
fell
forward
in
his
chariot
ahaziah
wounded
near
ibleam
managed
however
to
take
refuge
in
megiddo
where
he
died
his
servants
bringing
the
body
back
to
jerusalem
according
to
the
very
curtailed
account
in
chron
xxii
ahaziah
appears
to
have
hidden
himself
in
samaria
where
he
was
discovered
and
taken
to
jehu
who
had
him
killed
this
account
may
perhaps
have
belonged
to
the
different
version
of
which
a
fragment
has
been
preserved
in
kings
x
when
jezebel
heard
the
news
she
guessed
the
fate
which
awaited
her
she
painted
her
eyes
and
tired
her
head
and
posted
herself
in
one
of
the
upper
windows
of
the
palace
as
jehu
entered
the
gates
she
reproached
him
with
the
words
it
peace
thou
zimri
thy
murderer
and
he
lifted
up
his
face
to
the
window
and
said
who
is
on
my
side
who
two
or
three
eunuchs
rose
up
behind
the
queen
and
he
called
to
them
throw
her
down
so
they
threw
her
down
and
some
of
her
blood
was
sprinkled
on
the
wall
and
on
the
horses
and
he
trode
her
under
foot
and
when
he
was
come
in
he
did
eat
and
drink
and
he
said
see
now
to
this
cursed
woman
and
bury
her
for
she
is
a
but
nothing
was
found
of
her
except
her
skull
hands
and
feet
which
they
buried
as
best
they
could
seventy
princes
the
entire
family
of
ahab
were
slain
and
their
heads
piled
up
on
either
side
of
the
gate
the
priests
and
worshippers
of
baal
remained
to
be
dealt
with
jehu
summoned
them
to
samaria
on
the
pretext
of
a
sacrifice
and
massacred
them
before
the
altars
of
their
god
according
to
a
doubtful
tradition
the
brothers
and
relatives
of
ahaziah
ignorant
of
what
had
happened
came
to
salute
joram
and
perished
in
the
confusion
of
the
slaughter
and
the
line
of
david
narrowly
escaped
extinction
with
the
house
of
omri
kings
x
stade
has
shown
that
this
account
is
in
direct
contradiction
with
its
immediate
context
and
that
it
belonged
to
a
version
of
the
events
differing
in
detail
from
the
one
which
has
come
down
to
us
according
to
the
latter
jehu
must
at
once
have
met
jehonadab
the
son
of
rechab
and
have
entered
samaria
in
his
company
vers
this
would
have
been
a
poor
way
of
inspiring
the
priests
of
baal
with
the
confidence
necessary
for
drawing
them
into
the
trap
according
to
chron
xxii
the
massacre
of
the
princes
of
judah
preceded
the
murder
of
ahaziah
athaliah
assumed
the
regency
broke
the
tie
of
vassalage
which
bound
judah
to
israel
and
by
a
singular
irony
of
fate
jerusalem
offered
an
asylum
to
the
last
of
the
children
of
ahab
the
treachery
of
jehu
in
addition
to
his
inexpiable
cruelty
terrified
the
faithful
even
while
it
served
their
ends
dynastic
crimes
were
common
in
those
days
but
the
tragedy
of
jezreel
eclipsed
in
horror
all
others
that
had
preceded
it
it
was
at
length
felt
that
such
avenging
of
jahveh
was
in
his
eyes
too
ruthless
and
a
century
later
the
prophet
hosea
saw
in
the
misery
of
his
people
the
divine
chastisement
of
the
house
of
jehu
for
the
blood
shed
at
his
accession
the
report
of
these
events
reaching
calah
awoke
the
ambition
of
shalmaneser
would
damascus
mistrusting
its
usurper
deprived
of
its
northern
allies
and
by
the
hebrews
prove
itself
as
invulnerable
as
in
the
past
at
all
events
in
shalmaneser
once
more
crossed
the
euphrates
marched
along
the
orontes
probably
receiving
the
homage
of
hamath
and
arvad
by
the
way
restricted
solely
to
the
resources
of
damascus
hazael
did
not
venture
to
advance
into
as
had
always
done
he
barricaded
the
defiles
of
and
entrenched
on
mount
shenir
with
the
flower
of
his
troops
prepared
to
await
the
attack
it
proved
the
most
bloody
battle
that
the
assyrians
had
up
to
that
period
ever
fought
hazael
lost
horsemen
chariots
and
yet
succeeded
in
falling
back
on
damascus
in
good
order
shalmaneser
finding
it
impossible
to
force
the
city
devastated
the
surrounding

burnt
numberless
villages
and

and
felled
all
the

up
to
the
margin
of
the
desert
this
district
had
never
since
the
foundation
of
the
kingdom
by
bezon
a
century
before
suffered
at
the
hands
of
an
army
and
its
population
enriched
as
much
by
peaceful
labour
as
by
the
spoil
of
its
successful
wars
offered
a
prize
of
incalculable
value
on
his
return
march
shalmaneser
raided
the
bekaa
entered
phoenicia
and
carved
a
triumphal
stele
on
one
of
the
rocks
of
baalirasi
the
site
of
baalirasi
is
left
undecided
by
assyriologists
the
events
which
follow
enable
us
to
affirm
with
tolerable
certainty
that
the
point
on
the
coast
where
shalmaneser
received
the
tributes
of
tyre
and
sidon
is
none
other
than
the
mouth
of
the
the
name
baalirasi
master
of
the
head
would
then
be
applicable
to
the
rocky
point
which
rises
to
the
south
of
the
river
and
on
which
egyptian
kings
had
already
sculptured
their
stelæ
the
kings
of
tyre
and
sidon
hastened
to
offer
him
numerous
gifts
and
jehu
who
owed
to
his
presence
temporary
immunity
from
a
syrian
invasion
sent
his
envoys
to
greet
him
accompanied
by
offerings
of
gold
and
silver
in
bars
vessels
of
gold
of
various
forms
situlæ
salvers
cups
tin
sceptres
and
wands
of
precious
woods
pride
was
flattered
by
this
homage
and
he
carved
on
one
of
his
monuments
the
representation
of
this
first
official
connection
of
assyria
with
israel

the
prestige
of
the
house
of
omri
was
still
a
living
influence
or
else
the
ninevite
scribes
were
imperfectly
informed
of
the
internal
changes
which
had
taken
place
in

victory
had
been
so
dearly
bought
that
the
following
year
the
assyrians
merely
attempted
an
expedition
for
in
the
amanos
their
next
move
was
to
push
forward
into
kuî
in
the
direction
of
the
pyramos
and
saros
in
the
summer
of
they
once
more
ventured
southwards
but
this
time
hazael
changed
his
tactics
pitched
battles
and
massed
movements
in
which
the
fate
of
a
campaign
was
decided
by
one
cast
of
the
dice
were
now
avoided
and
ambuscades
guerilla
warfare
and
long
and
tedious
sieges
became
the
order
of
the
day
by
the
time
that
four
towns
had
been
taken
patience
was
worn
out
he
drew
off
his
troops
and
fell
back
on
phoenicia
laying
tyre
sidon
and
byblos
under
tribute
before
returning
into
mesopotamia
hazael
had
shown
himself
possessed
of
no
less
energy
than
and
damascus
isolated
had
proved
as
formidable
a
foe
as
damascus
surrounded
by
its
vassals
shalmaneser
therefore
preferred
to
leave
matters
as
they
were
and
accept
the
situation
indeed
the
results
obtained
were
of
sufficient
importance
to
warrant
his
feeling
some
satisfaction
he
had
ruthlessly
dispelled
the
dream
of
syrian
hegemony
which
had
buoyed
up
he
had
forced
damascus
to
withdraw
the
suzerainty
it
had
exercised
in
the
south
and
he
had
conquered
northern
syria
and
the
lower
basin
of
the
orontes
before
running
any
further
risks
he
judged
it
prudent
to
strengthen
his
recently
acquired
authority
over
these
latter
countries
and
to
accustom
the
inhabitants
to
their
new
position
as
subjects
of
nineveh
he
showed
considerable
wisdom
by
choosing
the
tribes
of
the
taurus
and
of
the
oappadocian
marches
as
the
first
objects
of
attack
in
regions
so
difficult
of
access
war
could
only
be
carried
on
with
considerable
hardship
and
severe
loss
the
country
was
seamed
by
torrents
and
densely
covered
with
undergrowth
while
the
towns
and
villages
which
clung
to
the
steep
sides
of
the
valleys
had
no
need
of
walls
to
become
effective
fortresses
for
the
houses
rose
abruptly
one
above
another
and
formed
so
many
redoubts
which
the
enemy
would
be
forced
to
attack
and
take
one
by
one
few
pitched
battles
could
be
fought
in
a
district
of
this
description
the
assyrians
wore
themselves
out
in
incessant
skirmishes
and
endless
petty
sieges
and
were
barely
compensated
by
the
meagre
spoil
which
such
warfare
yielded
illustration
a
mountain
village
drawn
by
boudier
from
a
photograph
by
alfred
boissier
in
shalmaneser
swept
over
the
country
of
tabal
and
reduced
of
its
princes
to
a
state
of
subjection
proceeding
thence
he
visited
the
mountains
of
turat
celebrated
from
this
period
downwards
for
their
silver
mines
and
quarries
of
valuable
marbles
the
position
of
the
mountains
of
turat
is
indicated
by
the
nature
of
their
products
know
of
silver
at
marash
and
an
iron
mine
not
worked
and
fine
one
of
pink
and
the
other
of
black
turat
therefore
must
be
the
marash
mountain
the
and
its
spurs
hence
the
two
sorts
of
stone
mentioned
in
the
assyrian
text
would
be
the
one
the
pink
the
other
the
black
marble
in
he
seized
the
stronghold
of
uêtash
in
melitene
and
laid
tabal
under
a
fresh
contribution
this
constituted
a
sort
of
advance
post
in
the
sight
of
those
warlike
and
continually
fluctuating
races
situated
between
the
sources
of
the
halys
and
the
desert
border
of
asia
minor
secure
on
this
side
he
was
about
to
bring
matters
to
a
close
in
cilicia
when
the
defection
of
ianzu
recalled
him
to
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
empire
he
penetrated
into
namri
by
the
defiles
of
khashmur
made
a
hasty
march
through
and
surprised
the
rebels
and
drove
them

he
then
bore
down
on

plundered
petty
kings
consecutively
a
fragment
of
an
anonymous
list
discovered
by
delitzsch
puts
the
expedition
against
the

instead
of
in
and
consequently
makes
the
entire
series
of
ensuing
expeditions
one
year
later
up
to
the
revolt
of
pal
this
is
evidently
a
mistake
of
the
scribe
who
compiled
this
edition
of
the
canon
and
the
chronology
of
a
contemporary
monument
such
as
the
black
obelisk
ought
to
obtain

further
light
can
be
thrown
on
the
subject
for
the
site
of
khashmur
or
khashmar
cf
note
the
other
localities
can
not
as
yet
be
identified
with
any
modern

may
conjecture
that
they
were

with
the

termination
parsuash

been

first
with

then
with

and

still
persists
in
its
identification
if
not
with
the
parthia
of
classical
geographers
at
least
with
the
parthian
people
schrader
has
shown
that
it
ought
to
be
sought
between
namri
on
the
south
and
the
mannai
on
the
north
in
one
of
the
valleys
of
the
gordysean
mountains
and
his
demonstration
has
been
accepted
with
a
few
modifications
of
detail
by
most
scholars
i
believe
it
to
be
possible
to
determine
its
position
with
still
further
precision
parsua
on
one
side
lay
on
the
border
of
namri
which
comprises
the
districts
to
the
east
of
the
dîyalah
in
the
direction
of
zohab
and
was
contiguous
to
the
medes
on
the
other
side
and
also
to
the
mannai
who
occupied
the
southern
regions
of
lake
urumiah
it
also
lies
close
to
the
principal
of
the
cossæan
tribes
as
it
would
appear
i
can
find
only
one
position
on
the
map
which
would
answer
to
all
these
requirements
this
is
in
the
main
the
basin
of
the
and
its
small
affluents
the
ardelân
and
the
sources
of
the

i
shall
there
place

further
information
is
forthcoming
on
the
subject

and

of
the

lying
on
the

at
length
came
up
with

he
seized

gives
us

been
located
further
westwards
by
schrader
near
the
upper
course
of

but
the
documents
of
all
periods
show
us
that
on
one
side
it
adjoined
kharkhar
that
is
the
basin
of
the
âb
on
the
other
side
media
that
is
the
country
of
hamadan
it
must
therefore
be
placed
between
the
two
in
the
northern
part
of
the
ancient
cambadenê
in
the
present
tchamabadân
kharkhar
in
this
case
would
be
in
the
southern
part
of
cambadene
on
the
main
road
which
leads
from
the
gates
of
the
zagros
to
hamadan
an
examination
of
the
general
features
of
the
country
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
town
of
kharkhar
should
occupy
the
site
of
kirmânshahân
or
rather
of
the
ancient
city
which
preceded
that
town
it
was
at
this
juncture
perhaps
that
he
received
from
the
people
of
muzri
the
gift
of
an
elephant
and
some
large
monkeys
representations
of
which
he
has
left
us
on
one
of
his
elephants
were
becoming
rare
and
it
was
not
now
possible
to
kill
them
by
the
hundred
as
formerly
in
syria
this
particular
animal
therefore
excited
the
wonder
of
the
ninevites
and
the
possession
of
it
flattered
the
vanity
of
the
conqueror
this
was
however
an
interlude
of
short
duration
and
the
turbulent
tribes
of
the
taurus
recalled
him
to
the
west
as
soon
as
spring
set
in
he
laid
waste
kuî
in
destroyed

its
capital
and

territory

and

he
had
now
occupied
the
throne
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
not
a
year
of
which
had
elapsed
without
seeing
the
monarch
gird
on
his
armour
and
lead
his
soldiers
in
person
towards
one
or
other
points
of
the
horizon
he
was
at
length
weary
of
such
perpetual
warfare
and
advancing
age
perchance
prevented
him
from
leading
his
troops
with
that
dash
and
vigour
which
are
necessary
to
success
however
this
might
be
on
his
return

he
laid
aside
his
armour
once
for
all
and
devoted
himself
to
peaceful
occupations
but
he
did
not
on
that
account
renounce
all
attempts
at
conquest
conducting
his
campaigns
by
proxy
delegated
the
command
of
his
army
to
his
tartan
and
the
northern
tribes
were
the
first
on
whom
this
general
gave
proof
of
his
prowess

passed
into
the
hands
of
another
sovereign
since
its
defeat
in
and
a
second
had
taken
the
place
of

who
had
ruled
at
the
beginning
of
reign
the
name
is
written
siduri
or
seduri
in
the
text
of
the
obelisk
probably
in
accordance
with
some
popular
pronunciation
in
which
the
r
was
but
slightly
rolled
and
finally
disappeared
the
identity
of
seduri
and
sharduris
has
been
adopted
by
recent
historians
belck
and
lehmann
have
shown
that
this
seduri
was
not
sharduris
son
of
lutipris
but
a
sharduris
probably
the
son
of
aramê
it
would
appear
that
the
accession
of
this
prince
who
was
probably
young
and
active
was
the
signal
for
a
disturbance
among
the
people
of
the
upper
tigris
and
the
masios
a
race
always
impatient
of
the
yoke
and
ready
to
make
common
cause
with
any
fresh
enemy
of
assyria
an
insurrection
broke
out
in
and
the
neighbouring
districts
quelled
it
offhand
then
quitting
the
basin
of
the
tigris
by
the
défiles
of
armash
he
crossed
the
arzania
and
entered
urartu
sharduris
came
out
to
meet
him
and
was
defeated
if
we
may
give
credence
to
the
official
record
of
the
campaign
even
if
the
account
be
an
authentic
one
the
victory
was
of
no
advantage
to
the
assyrians
for
they
were
obliged
to
retreat
before
they
had
subjugated
the
enemy
and
an
insurrection
among
the
patina
prevented
them
from
returning
to
the
attack
in
the
following
year
with
obligations
to
their
foreign
master
on
one
hand
and
to
their
own
subjects
on
the
other
the
princes
of
the
syrian
states
had
no
easy
life
if
they
failed
to
fulfil
their
duties
as
vassals
then
an
assyrian
invasion
would
pour
in
to
their
country
and
sooner
or
later
their
ruin
would
be
assured
they
would
have
before
them
the
prospect
of
death
by
impaling
or
under
the
knife
of
the
flayer
or
if
they
escaped
this
captivity
and
exile
in
a
land
prudence
therefore
dictated
a
scrupulous
fidelity
to
their
suzerain
on
the
other
hand
if
they
resigned
themselves
to
their
dependent
condition
the
people
of
their
towns
would
chafe
at
the
payment
of
tribute
or
some
ambitious
relative
would
take
advantage
of
the
popular
discontent
to
hatch
a
plot
and
foment
a
revolution
and
the
prince
thus
threatened
would
escape
from
an
assyrian
reprisal
only
to
lose
his
throne
or
fall
by
the
blow
of
an
assassin
in
circumstances
such
as
these
the
people
of
the
patina
murdered
their
king
lubarna
and
proclaimed
in
his
room
a
certain
sum
who
had
no
right
to
the
crown
but
who
doubtless
undertook
to
liberate
them
from
the
foreigner
defeated
the
rebels
and
blockaded
the
remains
of
their
army
in
kinalua
they
defended
themselves
at
first
energetically
but
on
the
death
of
surri
from
some
illness
their
courage
failed
them
and
they
offered
to
deliver
over
the
sons
of
their
chief
if
their
own
lives
might
be
spared
had
the
poor
wretches
impaled
laid
the
inhabitants
under
a
heavy
contribution
and
appointed
a
certain
sâsi
son
of
uzza
to
be
their
king
the
remainder
of
syria
gave
no
further
trouble
a
fortunate
circumstance
for
the
countries
on
the

however
that

afforded

enabled

of

aramæan

were
rent
from

though
iv
waged
continuous
warfare
during
the
twelve
years
that
he
governed
he
could
only
partially
succeed
in
regaining
the
territory
which
had
been
thus
lost
all
that
we
know
of
the
reign
of
iv
comes
from
an
inscription
in
archaic
characters
containing
the
account
of
four
campaigns
without
giving
the
years
of
each
reign
or
the
and
historians
have
classified
them
in
different
ways
his
first
three
campaigns
against
the
and
eastern
provinces
he
began
by
attempting
to
collect
the
tribute
from
naîri
the
payment
of
which
had
been
suspended
since
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
and
he
the
dominion
of
assyria
from
the
district
of
paddir
to
the
township
of
which
his
father
had
founded
at
the
fords
of
the
euphrates
opposite
to
carchemish
in
the
following
campaign
he
did
not
personally
take
part
but
the
rabshakeh
pillaged
the
shores
of
lake
urumiah
and
then
made
his
way
towards
urartu
where
he
destroyed
three
hundred
towns
the
third
expedition
was
directed
against
misi
and
gizilbunda
beyond
the
upper
zab
and
mount
zilar
the
inhabitants
of
misi
entrenched
themselves
on
a
wooded
ridge
commanded
by
three
peaks
but
were
defeated
in
spite
of
the
advantages
which
their
position
secured
for
them
the
people
of
gizilbunda
were
not
more
fortunate
than
their
neighbours
and
six
thousand
of
them
perished
at
the
assault
of
urash
their
capital
mount
zilar
is
beyond
the
upper
zab
on
one
of
the
roads
which
lead
to
the
basin
of
lake
urumiah
probably
in
khubushkia
there
are
two
of
these
roads
that
which
passes
over
the
neck
of
kelishin
and
the
other
which
runs
through
the
gorges

the
exception
of
these
two
points
the
mountain
chain
is
absolutely
according
to
the
general
direction
of
the
campaign
it
appears
to
me
probable
that
the
king
crossed
by
the
passes
of
alan
mount
zilâr
would
therefore
be
the
group
of
chains
which
cover
the

the

descending

all
these

incline
us
to
place

of

it
may
be
asked
if
the
word
kizil
which
occurs
several
times
in
the
topographical
nomenclature
of
these
regions
is
not
a
relic
of
the
name
in
question
and
if
is
not
a
compound
of
the
same
class
as
gatchi
kizihalân
whether
it
be
that
part
of
the
population
spoke
a
language
analogous
to
the
dialects
now
in
use
in
these
districts
or
that
the
ancient
word
has
been
preserved
by
later
conquerors
and
assimilated
to
some
known
word
in
their
own
language
at
once
turned

the

vanquished
them
and
drove
them
at
the
point
of
the
sword
into
their
remote
valleys
returning
to
the
district
of
araziash
which
he
laid
waste
a
score
of
chiefs
with
barbarous
names
alarmed
by
this
example
hastened
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
feet
and
submitted
to
the
tribute
which
he
imposed
on
them
assyria
thus
regained
in
these
regions
the
ascendency
which
the
victories
of
shalmaneser
iii
in
their
time
had
won
for
her
babylon
which
had
endured
the
suzerainty
of
its
rival
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
seems
to
have
taken
advantage
of
the
events
occurring
in
assyria
to
throw
off
the
yoke
by
espousing
the
cause
of
therefore
as
soon
as
he
was
free
to
turn
his
attention

his
forces

however
although
reinforced

utterly
routed
before
its
walls

the
respite
thus
obtained
gave
sufficient
time
to
collect
the
main
body
of
his
troops
the
army
was
recruited
from
kaldâ
and

one

reached

offered
sacrifices
to
the

as
his
father
had
done
before
him
and
concluded
a
treaty
with
the
terms
of
which
included
rectification
of
boundaries
payment
of
a
subsidy
and
the
other
clauses
usual
in
such
circumstances
the
peace
was
probably
ratified
by
a
matrimonial
alliance
concluded
between
the
babylonian
princess
sammuramat
and
son
of
the
conqueror
in
this
manner
the
hegemony
of
assyria
over
karduniash
was
established
even
more
firmly
than
before
the
insurrection

all
available
resources
had
been
utilised
in

secure
it

no
leisure

it
had
been

the
peace
with
babylon
moreover
did
not
last
long
who
had
succeeded
refused
to
observe
the
terms
of
the
treaty
and
hostilities
again
broke
out
on
the
turnat
and
the
tigris
as
they
had
done
six
years
previously
this
war
was
prolonged
from
to
and
was
still
proceeding

died
his
son

quickly
brought
it
to
a
successful
issue
he
carried
captive
to
assyria
with
his
family
and
the
nobles
of
his
court
and
placed
on
the
vacant
throne
one
of
his
own
partisans
while
he
celebrated
festivals
in
honour
of
his
own
supremacy
at
babylon
kuta
and
borsippa
karduniash
made
no
attempt
to
rebel
against
assyria
during
the
next
proved
himself
an
energetic
and
capable
sovereign
and
the
thirty
years
of
his
reign
were
by
no
means
inglorious
we
learn
from
the
eponym
lists
what
he
accomplished
during
that
time
and
against
which
countries
he
waged
war
but
we
have
not
yet
recovered
any
inscription
to
enable
us
to
fill
in
this
outline
and
put
together
a
detailed
account
of
his
reign
his
first
expeditions
were
directed
against
media
gozân
and
the
mannai
he
then
crossed
the
euphrates
and
in
four
successive
years
conducted
as
many
vigorous
campaigns
against

the
town
of

and
the
cities

the

interfering

lushia
in

in

enumeration
conjures
up
a
vision
of
an
enterprising

victorious
monarch
of
the
type
of

shalmaneser
one
who
perhaps
succeeded
even
where

the
manner
in

before
long
the
memory
of
his
services
faded
away
and
the

sought
only
how
to
rid
himself
of
a
tutelage
which
had
grown
irksome
the

had
suffered
during

late

all

be
placed
unreservedly
at

disposal
of
the

on
condition
that
they
should
apply
them
to
the
maintenance
of
the
services
and

of
the

the
priests
accepted
the
gift
but
failed
in
the
faithful
observance
of
the
conditions

that
in
the
king
was
obliged
to
take
stringent
measures
to
compel
them
to
repair
the
breaches
in

therefore
withdrew
the
privilege
which

abused

disastrous
reign

both
he
and
his

been
obliged
to
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
hazael
not
only
was
he
in
the
position
of
an
inferior

in
order
to
preclude
any

from
this

judah
became
like

with
the
possible

formed
a

as
strong

had
successfully
resisted

therefore
did
not
venture
to
attack
syria
during
the
lifetime
of
hazael
but
a
change
of
sovereign
is
always
a
critical
moment
in
the
history

eastern

is
doubtful
whether
pushed
further
south

penetrated
in
person
as
far
as
the
deserts

a
suggestion
which
the
mention
of
the
philistines
and
edomites
among
the
list
of
his
tributary
states
might
induce
us
to
accept
probably
it
was
not
the
case
and
he
really
went
no
further
than
damascus
but
the
submission
of
that
city
included
in
theory
at
least
the
submission
of
all
states
subject
to
her
sway
and
these
dependencies
may
have
sent
some
presents
to
testify
their
desire
to
conciliate
his
favour
their
names
appear
in
the
inscriptions
in
order
to
swell
the
number
of
direct
or
indirect
vassals
of
the
empire

they
were
subject
to
a
state
which
had
been
effectually
conquered

not
meet
with
such
good
fortune
in
the
north
not
only
did
he
fail
to
obtain
the
brilliant
successes
which
elsewhere
attended
his
arms
but
he
ended
by
sustaining
considerable
reverses
the
ninevite
historians
reckoned
the
two
expeditions
of
and
against
the
mannai
as
victories
doubtless
because
the
king
returned
with
a
train
of
prisoners
and
loaded
with
spoil

the
vannic
inscriptions

that
urartu
which
had
been
rising
into
prominence
during
the
reign
of
shalmaneser

now
grown
still
more
powerful

in

towards

but
several

testify
that
he
pushed
his

distance
towards

rebuilt

there
inscriptions

it
follows
from

that
the

of

replaced

abode
of
the

circumstances
it
naturally
passed
away
with
the

of

imposed

partly
subjugated
the

planting

throughout

to
strengthen

kingdom

stretching
from
the
south

of
the
araxes
to
the
upper
reaches
of
the
zab
and
the

was
quite
equal
to

in
size

probably
surpassed
it
in
density
of
population
for
it
contained
no
barren
steppes
such
as
stretched

affording
support
merely
to
a
few
wretched

the
sovereigns
of

began
to
consider
themselves
on
an
equality
with

endeavoured
still

to
imitate
them

the
luxury
and
display
of
their
domestic
life
as
well
as
in
the
energy
of
their
actions
and
the
continuity
of
their
victories
they
engraved
everywhere
on
the
rocks
triumphal
inscriptions
destined
to
show
to
posterity
their
own
exploits
and
the
splendour
of
their
gods
having
made
this
concession
to
their
vanity
they
took
effective
measures
to
assure
possession
of
their

selected
in
the

on

they
would
build
a
fortress

finding
a

already
existing

would
repair
it

with
the

of
the
of
as
far
as
we
are
at

acquainted
with

müller
has
shown
in
fact
that
they
contain
the
account
of
fourteen
campaigns
probably
the
first
fourteen
of
the
reign
of
argistis
and
he
has
recognised
in
accordance
with
the
observations
of
stanislas
guyard
the
formula
which
separates
the
campaigns
one
from
another
there
are
two
campaigns
against
the
peoples
of
the
upper
euphrates
mentioned
before
the
campaigns
against
assyria
and
as
these
latter
follow
continuously
after
it
is
probable
that
the
former
must
be
placed
in
which
would
give
or
for
the
year
of
his
accession
he
was
engaged
up
to
the
last
in
a
quarrel
with
the
princes
who
occupied
the
mountainous
country
to
the
north
of
the
araxes
and
his
son
argistis
spent
the
first
few
years
of
his
reign
in
completing
his
conquests
in
this
region
he
crushed
with
ease
an
attempted
revolt
in
dayaîni
and
then
invaded
etius
systematically
devastating
it
its
king
uduris
being
powerless
to
prevent
his
ravages
all
the
principal
towns
succumbed
one
after
another
before
the
vigour
of
his
assault
and
from
the
numbers
killed
and
taken
prisoners
we
may
surmise
the
importance
of
his
victories
in
these
barbarous
districts
to
which
belonged
the
names
of
seriazis
silius
zabakhas
zirimutaras
babanis

as

the

of

had
greatly
advanced
the
work
of
conquest
when
the
accession
of
a
new
sovereign
in
assyria
made
argistis
decide
to
risk
a
change
of
front
and
to
concentrate
the
main
part
of
his
forces
on
the
southern
boundary
of
his
empire
after
his
last
contest
in
khubushkia
in
had
fought
two
consecutive
campaigns
against
the
aramæan
tribes
of
itua
near
the
frontiers
of
babylon
and
he
was
still
in
conflict
with
them
when
he
died
in
his
son
shalmaneser
may
have
wished
to
signalise
the
commencement
of
his
reign
by
delivering
from
the
power
of
urartu
the
provinces
which
the
kings
of
that
country
had
wrested
from
his
ancestors
or
perhaps
argistis
thought
that
a
change
of
ruler
offered
him
an
excellent
opportunity
for
renewing
the
struggle
at
the
point
where
menuas
had
left
it
and
for
conquering
yet
more
of
the
territory
which
still
remained
to
his
rival
whatever
the
cause
the
assyrian
annals
show
us
the
two
adversaries
ranged
against
each
other
in
a
struggle
which
lasted
from
to
argistis
had
certainly
the
upper
hand
and
though
his
advance
was
not
rapid
it
was
never
completely
checked
the
first
engagement
took
place
at
nirbu
near
the
sources
of
the
supnat

the

the

war
had
shifted
and
the
contest
was
now
carried
on
in
the
countries
bordering
on

urumiah
bustus
and
parsua
the
natives
gained
nothing
by
the
change
of
invader
and
were
as
hardly
used
by
the
king
of
urartu
as
they
had
been
by
shalmaneser
iii
or
by
samsirammân
as
was
invariably
the
case
their
towns
were
given
over
to
the
flames
their
fields
ravaged
their
cattle
and
their
families
carried
into
captivity
their
resistance
however
was
so
determined
that
a
second
campaign
was
required
to
complete
the
conquest
and
this
time
the
assyrians
suffered
a
serious
defeat
at
surisidas
and
a
year
at
least
was
needed
for
their
recovery
from
the
disaster
during
this
respite
argistis

to
complete
the
pacification
of

had
not
been
reduced
to
subjection
by

returned
to
the
conflict
he
defeated
them
again
and
while
they
withdrew
to

a
rebellion
had
broken
out

reduced

small

clustered

was
conducting
a

made

he
was
again
victorious

from
henceforth

so
persistently
endeavoured
for
more
than
a
century
to
establish
her
own
supremacy
became

hold
of
them
proved
however
to
be
a
precarious
and
uncertain
one

difficulties
assailed
him

of

worthy
to
bear

with
the
most
indefatigable

triumphant
of

pharaohs
of
egypt
or
the
lords
of
chaldæa
the
inscriptions
which
are
constantly
being
discovered
within
the
limits
of
his
kingdom
prove
that
following
the
example
of
all
oriental
sovereigns
he
delighted
as
much
in
building
as
in
battle
perhaps
we
shall
some
day
recover
a
sufficient
number
of
records
to
enable
us
to
restore

been
accompanied

the

as
in

times
had
been
the
case
with

that
arpad

proved
among

neither
arpad

ever
neglected

send
the
customary
presents
to
any
sovereign
who
had
the
temerity
to
cross
the
euphrates
and
advance
into
their
neighbourhood
but
the
necessity
for
this
act

homage
became
more
and
more
infrequent

eighteen
years

before

death
assyria
was
gradually
becoming
involved
in
difficulties
and
the
means
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
its
empire
were
less
available
than
formerly
assurdân
had
frankly
renounced
all
idea
of
attacking
urartu
but
he
had
at
least
endeavoured
to
defend
himself
against
his
enemies
on
the
southern
and
eastern
frontiers
he
had
led
his
armies
against
gananâtê
against
itua
and
against
the
medes
before
risking
an
attack
on
hadrach
but
more
than
this
he
had
not
attempted
on
two
occasions
in
eight
years
he
had
preferred
to
abstain
from
offensive
action
and
had
remained
inactive
in
his
own
country
assyria
found
herself
in
one
of
those
crises
of
exhaustion
which
periodically
laid
her
low
after
each
outbreak
of
ambitious
enterprise
she
might
well
be
compared
to
a
man
worn
out
by
fatigue
and
loss
of
blood
who
becomes
breathless
and
needs
repose
as
soon
as
he
attempts
the
least
exertion
before
long
too
the
scourges
of
disease
and
civil
strife
combined
with
exhaustion
in
hastening
her
ruin
the
plague
had
broken
out
in
the
very
year
of
the
last
expedition
against
hadrach
perhaps
under
the
walls
of
that
city
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
occurred
in
in
the
month
of
sivân
and
this
harbinger
of
woe
was
the
signal
for
an
outbreak
of
revolt
in
the
city
of
assur
the
ideas
which
orientals
held
on
the
subject
of
comets
renders
the
connection
between
the
two
events
very
likely
if
not
certain
from
assur
the
movement
spread
to
arrapkha
and
wrought
havoc
there
from
to
it
then
passed
on
to
gozân
where
it
was
not
finally
extinguished
till
the
last
remains
of
assyrian
authority
in
syria
vanished
during
this
period
assurdân
after
two
respite
endeavoured
to
it

attacked
successively
hadrach

this
was
his
last
exploit
his
son

spent
his
short
reign
of
eight
years
in
helpless
inaction
he
lost
syria
he
carried
on
hostilities
in
namri
from
to
whether
against
the
aramaeans
or
urartians
is
uncertain
then
relapsed
into
inactivity
and
a
popular
sedition
drove
him
finally
from
calah
in
he
died
some
months
later
without
having
repressed
the
revolt
none
of
his
sons
succeeded
him

the

fallen
into
disrepute
through
the
misfortunes
of

in
their
turn

their

over
the
countries
of
the
euphrates

the

like
those
of
the
egyptians
before

their

enriched
their
own
cities
and
spread
the
terror
of
their
name
throughout
the
eastern
world
but
their
supremacy
had
only
taken
firm
root
in
the
plains
bordering
on
mesopotamia
and
just
when
they
were
preparing
to
extend
their
rule
a
power
had
sprung
up
beside
them
over
which
they
had
been
unable
to
triumph
they
had
been
obliged
to
withdraw
behind
the
euphrates
and
they
might
reasonably
have
asked
themselves
whether
by
weakening
the
peoples
of
syria
at
the
price
of
the
best
blood
of
their
own
nation
they
had
not
merely
laboured
for
the
benefit
of
a
rival
power
and
facilitated
the
rise
of
urartu
egypt
after
her
victory
over
the
peoples
of
the
sea
had
seemed
likely
for
the
moment
to
make
a
fresh
start
on
a
career
of
conquest
under
the
energetic
influence
of
ramses
but
her
forces
proved
unequal
to
the
task
and
as
soon
as
the
hand
ceased
to
urge
her
on
she
shrank
back
without
a
struggle
within
her
ancient
limits
and
ere
long
nothing
remained
to
her
of
the
asiatic
empire
carved
out
by
the
warlike
pharaohs
of
the
theban
dynasties
if
could
show
the
same
courage
and
capacity
as
ramses
he
might
well
be
equally
successful
and
raise
his
nation
again
to
power
but
time
alone
could
prove
whether
nineveh
on
his
death
would
be
able
to
maintain
a
continuous
effort
or
whether
her
new
display
of
energy
would
prove
merely
ephemeral
and
her
empire
be
doomed
to
sink
into
irremediable
weakness

the

of

now
in

events
proved
that
in
this
period
at
any
rate
the
decadence
of
assyria
was
not
due
to
any
exhaustion
of
the
race
or
impoverishment
of
the
country
but
was
mainly
owing
to
the
incapacity
of
its
kings
and
the
lack
of
energy
displayed
by
their
generals
if
menuas
and
argistis
had
again
and
again
triumphed
over
the
assyrians
during
half
a
century
it
was
not
because
their
bands
of
raw
recruits
were
superior
to
the
tried
veterans
of
in
either
discipline
or
courage
the
assyrian
troops
had
lost
none
of
their
former
valour
and
their
showed
no
trace
of
diminution
but
their
leaders
had
lost
the
power
of
handling
their
men
after
the
vigorous
fashion
of
their
predecessors
and
showed
less
foresight
and
tenacity
in
conducting
their
campaigns
although
decimated
and
driven
from
fortress
to
fortress
and
from
province
to
province
hampered
by
the
rebellions
it
was
called
upon
to
suppress
and
distracted
by
civil
discord
the
assyrian
army
still
remained
a
strong
and
efficient
force
ever
ready
to
make
its
full
power
felt
the
moment
it
realised
that
it
was
being
led
by
a
sovereign
capable
of
employing
its
good
qualities
to
advantage
had
doubtless
held
a
military
command
before
ascending
the
throne
and
had
succeeded
in
winning
the
confidence
of
his
men
as
soon
as
he
had
assumed
the
leadership
they
regained
their
former
prestige
and
restored
to
their
country
that
supremacy
which
its
last
three
rulers
had
failed
to
maintain
the
official
documents
dealing
with
the
history
of
iii
have
been
seriously
mutilated
and
there
is
on
several
points
some
difference
of
opinion
among
historians
as
to
the
proper
order
in
which
the
fragments
ought
to
be
placed
and
consequently
as
to
the
true
sequence
of
the
various
campaigns

either
resumed

thrown
in
their
lot
with
the
states
against
which
they
had
been
intended
to
watch
the
aramaean
tribes
never
let
slip
an
opportunity
of
encroaching
on
the
southern
frontier
so
far
the
migratory
instinct
which
had
brought
them
from
the
arabian
desert
to
the
swamps
of
the
persian
gulf
had
met
with
no
check
those
who
first
reached
its
shores
became
the
founders
of
that
nation
of
the
kaldâ
which
had
perhaps
already
furnished
babylon
with
one
of
its
dynasties
others
had
soon
after
followed
in
their
footsteps
and
passing
beyond
the
kaldâ
settlement
had
gradually
made
their
way
along
the
canals
which
connect
the
euphrates
with
the
tigris
till
they
had
penetrated
to
the
lowlands
of
the
uknu
towards
the
middle
of
the
eighth
century
they
wedged
themselves
in
between
elam
and
karduniash
forming
so
many
buffer
states
of
varying
size
and
influence
they
extended
from
north
to
south
along
both
banks
of
the
tigris
their
different
tribes
being
known
as
the
gambulu
the
puqudu
the
litau
the
damunu
the
ruuâ
the
khindaru
the
labdudu
the
harîlu
and
the
rubuu
the

who
formed
the
vanguard
reached
the
valleys
of
the
turnat
during
the
reign
of
iii
they
were
defeated
in
but
obstinately
renewed
hostilities
in
and
favoured
by
circumstances
they
ended
by
forcing
the
cordon
of
assyrian
outposts
and
by
the
time
of
had
secured
a
footing
on
the
lower
zab
close
by
to
the
east
of
them
lay
namri
and
media
both
at
that
time
in
a
state
of
absolute
anarchy
the
invasions
of
menuas
and
of
argistis
had
entirely
laid
waste
the
country
and
sharduris
the
king
who
succeeded
argistis
had
done
nothing
towards
permanently
incorporating
them
with
urartu
sharduris
while
still
to
the
throne
had
been
appointed
by
his
father
governor
of
the
recently
annexed
territory
belonging
to
etius
and
the
mannai
he
made
lununis
his
headquarters
and
set
himself
to
subdue
the
barbarians
who
had
settled
between
the
kur
and
the
araxes
when
he
succeeded
to
the
throne
about
the
enjoyment
of
supreme
power
in
no
way
lessened
his
activity
on
the
contrary
he
at
once
fixed
upon
the
sort
of
wide
isthmus
which
separates
the
araxes
from
lake
urumiah
as
the
goal
of
his
incursions
and
overran
the
territory
of
the
babilu
there
he
carried
by
storm
three
royal
castles
cities
and
sixty
villages
he
then
fell
back
upon
etius
passing
through
dakis
edias
and
urmes
on
his
way
and
brought
back
with
him
children
women
men
capable
of
bearing
arms
oxen
sheep
and
horses
these
figures
give
some
idea
of
the
importance
of
his
victories
and
the
wealth
of
the
conquered
territory
the
list
of
aramæan
tribes
and
the
positions
occupied
by
them
towards
the
middle
of
the
eighth
century
have
been
given
us
by
iii
himself
did
not
encounter
any
urartian
forces
in
these
regions
as
would
almost
certainly
have
been
the
case
had
these
countries
remained
subject
to
urartu
from
the
invasions
of
menuas
and
argistis
onwards
argistis
tells
us
in
the
that
he
had
made
his
son
satrap
over
the
provinces
won
from
the
mannai
and
etius
though
his
name
is
not
mentioned
sayce
believes
this
son
must
have
been
sharduris
so
far
as
we
can
learn
he
does
not
seem
to
have
attacked
khubushkia
nor
to
have
entered
into
open
rivalry
with
assyria
even
under
the
rule
of
iii
assyria
showed
a
bold
enough
front
to
deter
any
enemy
from
disturbing
her
except
when
forced
to
do
so
sharduris
merely
strove
to
recover
those
portions
of
his
inheritance
to
which
assyria
attached
but
little
value
and
his
inscriptions
tell
us
of
more
than
one
campaign
waged
by
him
with
this
object
against
the
mountaineers
of
melitene
about
the
year
he
captured
most
of
their
citadels
one
after
another
dhumeskis
zapsas
fourteen
royal
castles
and
a
hundred
towns
including
milid
itself
where
king
khitaruadas
held
his
court
it
is
evident
from
the
account
of
the
campaigns
that
occupied
khubushkia
from
the
very
commencement
of
his
reign
we
must
therefore
assume
that
the
invasions
of
argistis
had
produced
only
transient
effects
these
campaigns
must
have
preceded
the
descent
into
syria
and
i
believe
this
latter
to
have
been
anterior
to
the
expedition
of
against
arpad
in
probably
tried
to
reconquer
the
tribes
who
had
just
become
subject
to
sharduris
the
descent
of
this
latter
into
syria
probably
took
place
about
or
and
his
wars
against
melitene
about
to
at
this
point
two
courses
lay
open
before
him
he
could
either
continue
his
march
westwards
and
penetrating
into
asia
minor
fall
upon
the
wealthy
and
industrious
races
who
led
a
prosperous
existence
between
the
halys
and
the
sangarios
such
as
the
tabal
the
chalybes
and
the
phrygians
or
he
could

to

itself

several

to
urartu

the
basis
on
which
its
rule
in

rested
had
as
we
know
at
first
sought
to
recover
it

his
attempt
to
do
so
in
was
unsuccessful

followed
in
the
steps
of
the
agusi
and
had
acknowledged
the
supremacy
of
sharduris
the
extent
of
the
dominions
of
sharduris
in
syria
may
be
deduced
from
the
list
of
the
allies
assigned
to
him
by
in
in
the
annals
this
prince
must
now
haye
been
sorely
tempted
to
adopt
on
his
own
account
the
policy
of
the
ninevite
monarchs
and
push
on
in
the
direction
of
hamath
damascus
and
the
phoenician
seaboard
towards
those
countries
of
israel
and
judah
which
were
nearly
coterminous
with
egypt

rapidity
of
the
victories
which
he
had
just
succeeded
in
winning
at
the
foot
of
mount
taurus
and
mount
amanus
must
have
seemed
a
happy
omen
of
what
awaited
his
enterprise
in
the
valleys
of
the
orontes
and
the
jordan
although
the
races
of
southern
and
central
syria
had
suffered
less
than
those
of
the
north
from
the
ambition
of
the
ninevite
kings
they
had
none
the
less
been
sorely
tried
during
the
previous
century
and
it
might
be
questioned
whether
they
had
derived
courage
from
the
humiliation
of
assyria
or
still
remained
in
so
feeble
a
state
as
to
present
an
easy
prey
to
the
first
invader
the
defeat
inflicted
on

by

done

little
harm
to
the
prestige
of

the
influence
exercised
by
this
state
from
the
sources
of
the
litany
to
the
brook
of
egypt
was
based
on
so
solid
a
foundation
that
no

begged

did
not
dare
to
shelter
the
vanquished
enemies

of

forgetting
his
hatred
of

in
delight
at
being
able
to
gratify

against

this
prophecy
which

pronounced

which

lived
in

it
is
now
generally
recognised
as
the
production
of
an
anonymous
judsean
prophet
and
the
earliest
authentic
fragment
of
prophetic
literature
which
has
come
down
to
us
this
revival
like
the
former
greatness
of
david
and
solomon
was
due
not
so
much
to
any
inherent
energy
on
the
part
of
israel
as
to
the
weakness
of
the
nations
on
its
frontiers
egypt
was
not
in
the
habit
of
intervening
in
the
quarrels
of
asia
and
assyria
was
suffering
from
a
temporary
eclipse
damascus
had
suddenly
collapsed
and
hadrach
or
mansuati
the
cities
which
sought
to
take
its
place
found
themselves
fully
employed
in
repelling
the
intermittent
attacks
of
the
assyrian
the
hebrews
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
therefore
had
the
stage
to
themselves
there
being
no
other
actors
to
dispute
their
possession
of
it
during
the
three
hundred
years
of
their
existence
as
a
monarchy
they
had
adopted
nearly
all
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
races
over
whom
they
held
sway
and
by
whom
they
were
completely
surrounded
the
bulk
of
the
people
devoted
themselves
to
the
pasturing
and
rearing
of
cattle
and
during
the
better
part
of
the
year
preferred
to
live
in
tents
unless
war
rendered
such
a
practice
impossible
they
had
few
industries
save
those
of
the
and
the
smith
and
their
trade
was
almost
entirely
in
the
hands
of
foreigners
cf
the
passage
in
kings
xiii
the
children
of
israel
dwelt
in
their
tents
as
although
the
word
had
by
that
time
acquired
the
more
general
meaning
of
the
context
here
seems
to
require
us
to
translate
it
by
its
original
meaning

the
antiquity
of
the
art
among
the
israelites
the
smith

practically
the
only
artisan
to
be
found
amongst
nomadic
tribes
we
find
however
hebrew
merchants
in
egypt

tyre

in
and
they
were
so
numerous
at
damascus
that
they
requested
that
a
special
bazaar
might
be
allotted
to
them
similar
to
that
occupied
by
the
merchants
of
damascus
in
samaria
from

the
accurate
ideas
on
the
subject
of
egypt
possessed
by
the
earliest
compilers
of
the
traditions
contained
in
genesis

that
hebrew
merchants
must
have
been
in
constant

as
a

it
has
been
estimated
that
the
owners
of
landed
estate
in
israel
who
were
in
that
capacity
liable
to
render
military
service
numbered
in
the
time
of
that
king
all
others
were
exempt
from
military
service
the
reigning
prince
was
hereditary
but
the
or
captain
of
the
troops
often
took
his
place
as
in
the
time
of
david
and
thereby
became
the
most
important
person
in
the
kingdom
more
than
one
of
these
officers
had
already
turned
against
their
sovereign
the
forces
which
he
had
entrusted
to
them
and
these
revolts
when
crowned
with
success
had
on
various
occasions
in
israel
at
any
rate
led
to
a
change
of
dynasty
omri
had
been
shar
zaba
when
he
mutinied
against
zimri
the
assassin
of
elah
and
jehu
occupied
the
same
position
when
elisha
deputed
him
to
destroy
the
house
of
omri
the
political
constitutions
of
judah
and
israel
were
on
the
whole
very
similar
to
those
of
the
numerous
states
which
shared
the
territory
of
syria
between
them
and
their
domestic
history
gives
us
a
fairly
exact
idea
of
the
revolutions
which
agitated
damascus
hamath
carchemish
arpad
and
the
principalities
of
amanos
and
lebanon
about
the
same
period
it
would
seem
however
that
none
of
these
other
nations
possessed
a
literary
or
religious
life
of
any
great
intensity
they
had
their
archives
it
is
true
in
which
were
accumulated
documents
relating
to
their
past
history
their
rituals
of
theology
and
religious
worship
their
collections
of
hymns
and
national
songs
but
none
of
these
have
survived
and
the
very
few
inscriptions
that
have
come
down
to
us
merely
show
that
they
had
nearly
all
of
them
adopted
the
alphabet
invented
by
the
phoenicians
the
israelites
initiated
by
them
into
the
art
of
writing
lost
no
time
in
setting
down
in
their
turn
all
they
could
recall
of
the
destinies
of
their
race
from
the
creation
of
the
world
down
to
the
time
in
which
they
lived
from
the
beginning
of
the
monarchical
epoch
onwards
their
scribes
collected
together
in
the
of
the
wars
of
the
the
of
and
in
other
works
the
titles
of
which
have
not
survived
lyrics
of
different
dates
in
which
nameless
poets
had
sung
the
victories
and
glorious
deeds
of
their
national
heroes
such
as
the
song
of
the
well
the
hymn
of
moses
the
triumphal
ode
of
deborah
and
the
blessing
of
jacob
they
were
able
to
draw
upon
traditions
which
preserved
the
memory
of
what
had
taken
place
in
the
time
of
the
judges
and
when
that
patriarchal
form
of
government
was
succeeded
by
a
monarchy
they
had
narratives
of
the
ark
of
the
lord
and
its
wanderings
of
samuel
saul
david
and
solomon
not
to
mention
the
official
records
which
since
then
had
been
continuously
produced
and
accumulated
by
the
court
historians
the
books
of
and
of
the
of
the
appear
to
date
from
the
ixth
century
as
the
latter
is
quoted
in
the
elohist
narrative
it
can
not
have
been
compiled
later
than
the
beginning
of
the
viiith
century
the
passage
in
numb
xxi
lib
is
the
only
one
expressly
attributed
by
the
testimony
of
the
ancients
to
the
of
the
wars
of
the
lord
but
modern
writers
add
to
this
the
of
the
well
numb
xxi
and
the
song
of
victory
over
moab
numb
xxi
the
of
the
sam
i
admittedly
formed
part
of
the
of
song
of
victory
over
the
amorites
josh
x
and
very
probably
the
couplet
recited
by
solomon
at
the
dedication
of
the
temple
kings
viii
placed
by
the
lxx
after
verse
also
formed
part
of
it
as
also
the
of
and
the
blessing
of
jacob
xlix
wellhausen
was
the
first
to
admit
the
existence
of
a
book
of
judges
prior
to
the
epoch
of
deuteronomy
and
his
opinion
has
been
adopted
by
kuenen
and
driver
this
book
was
probably
drawn
upon
by
the
two
historians
of
the
ixth
and
viiith
centuries
of
whom
we
are
about
to
speak
some
of
the
narratives
such
as
the
story
of
abimelech
and
possibly
that
of
ehud
may
have
been
taken
from
a
document
written
at
the
end
of
the
xth
or
the
beginning
of
the
ixth
centuries
the
revolutions
which
occurred
in
the
family
of
david
sam
bear
so
evident
a
stamp
of
authenticity
that
they
have
been
attributed
to
a
contemporary
writer
perhaps
ahimaaz
son
of
zadok
sam
xv
who
took
part
in
the
events
in
question
but
apart
from
this
the
existence
is
generally
admitted
of
two
or
three
books
which
were
drawn
up
shortly
after
the
separation
of
the
tribes
containing
a
kind
of
epic
of
the
history
of
the
first
two
kings
the
one
dealing
with
saul
for
instance
was
probably
written
in
the
time
of
jeroboam
the
two
lists
in
which
the
names
of
the
principal
personages
at
the
court
of
david
are
handed
down
to
us
mention
a
certain
jehoshaphat
son
of
ahilud
who
was
or
recorder
he
retained
his
post
under
solomon
kings
iv
it
may
be
that
more
than
one
writer
had
already
endeavoured
to
evolve
from
these
materials
an
epie
of
jahveh
and
his
faithful
people
but
in
the
second
half
of
the
ixth
century
perhaps
in
the
time
of
jehoshaphat
a
member
of
the
tribe
of
judah
undertook
to
put
forth
a
fresh
edition
the
approximate
date
of
the
composition
and
source
of
this
first
is
still
an
open
reuss
and
kuenen
not
to
mention
others
believe
the
jehovist
writer
to
have
been
a
native
of
the
northern
kingdom
i
have
adopted
the
opposite
view
which
is
supported
by
most
modern
critics
he
related
how
god
after
creating
the
universe
out
of
chaos
had
chosen
his
own
people
and
had
led
them
after
trials
innumerable
to
the
conquest
of
the
promised
land
he
showed
as
he
went
on
the
origin
of
the
tribes
identified
with
the
children
of
israel
and
the
covenants
made
by
jahveh
with
moses
in
the
arabian
desert
while
accepting
the
stories
connected
with
the
ancient
sanctuaries
of
the
north
and
east
at
shechem
bethel
peniel
mahanaim
and
succoth
it
was
at
hebron
in
judah
that
he
placed
the
principal
residence
of
abraham
and
his
descendants
his
style
while
simple
and
direct
is
at
the
same
time
singularly
graceful
and
vivacious
the
incidents
he
gives
are
carefully
selected
apt
and
characteristic
while
his
narrative
passes
from
scene
to
scene
without
trace
of
flagging
unburdened
by
useless
details
and
his
dialogue
always
natural
and
easy
rises
without
effort
from
the
level
of
familiar
conversation
to
heights
of
impassioned
eloquence
his
aim
was
not
merely
to
compile
the
history
of
his
people
he
desired
at
the
same
time
to
edify
them
by
showing
how
sin
first
came
into
the
world
through
disobedience
to
the
commandments
of
the
most
high
and
how
man
prosperous
so
long
as
he
kept
to
the
laws
of
the
covenant
fell
into
difficulties
as
soon
as
he
transgressed
or
failed
to
respect
them
his
concept
of
jahveh
is
in
the
highest
degree
a
concrete
one
he
regards
him
as
a
being
superior
to
other
beings
but
made
like
unto
them
and
moved
by
the
same
passions
he
shows
anger
and
is
appeased
displays
sorrow
and
repents
him
of
the
evil
when
the
descendants
of
noah
build
a
tower
and
a
city
he
draws
nigh
to
examine
what
they
have
done
and
having
taken
account
of
their
work
confounds
their
language
and
thus
prevents
them
from
proceeding
farther
he
desires
later
on
to
confer
a
favour
on
his
servant
abraham
he
appears
to
him
in
human
form
and
eats
and
drinks
with
him
sodom
and
gomorrah
had
committed
abominable
iniquities
the
cry
against
them
was
great
and
their
sin
very
grievous
but
before
punishing
them
he
tells
abraham
that
he
will
down
and
see
whether
they
have
done
according
to
the
cry
of
it
which
is
come
unto
me

if
not

him

appeased

at
her
feet
this
book
though
it
breathes
the
spirit
of
the
prophets
and
was
perhaps
written
in
one
of
their
schools
did
not
however
include
all
the
current
narratives
and
omitted
many
traditions
that
were
passing
from
lip
to
lip
moreover
the
excessive
materialism
of
its
treatment
no
longer
harmonised
with
that
more
idealised
concept
of
the
deity
which
had
already
begun
to
prevail
consequently
within
less
than
a
century
of
its
appearance
more
than
one
version
containing
changes
and
interpolations
in
the
narrative
came
to
be
circulated
till
a
scribe
of
ephraim
who
flourished
in
the
time
of
jeroboam
took
up
the
subject
and
dealt
with
it
in
a
different
fashion
xxxii
exod
iv
schrader
and
wellhausen
have
drawn
attention
to
contradictions
in
the
primitive
history
of
humanity
as
presented
by
the
jehovist
which
forbid
us
to
accept
it
as
the
work
of
a
single
writer
nor
can
these
inconsistencies
be
due
to
the
influence
of
the
elohist
since
the
latter
did
not
deal
with
this
period
in
his
book
budde
has
maintained
that
the
primitive
work
contained
no
account
of
the
deluge
and
traced
the
descent
of
all
the
nations
israel
included
back
to
cain
and
he
declares
he
can
detect
in
the
earlier
chapters
of
genesis
traces
of
a
first
jehovist
whom
he
calls
a
second
jehovist
who
flourished
between
and
is
supposed
to
have
added
to
the
contribution
of
the
first
certain
details
borrowed
from
the
babylonian
tradition
such
as
the
deluge
the
story
of
noah
of
nimrod
etc
finally
a
third
jehovist
is
said
to
have
thrown
the
versions
of
his
two
predecessors
into
one
taking
as
the
basis
of
his
work
the
date
and
origin
of
the
elohist
have
given
rise
to
no
less
controversy
than
those
of
the
jehovist
the
view
most
generally
adopted
is
that
he
was
a
native
of
the
northern
kingdom
and
flourished
about
putting
on
one
side
the
primitive
accounts
of
the
origin
of
the
human
race
which
his
predecessors
had
taken
pleasure
in
elaborating
he
confined
his
attention
solely
to
events
since
the
birth
of
abraham
his
origin
is
betrayed
by
the
preference
he
displays
for
details
calculated
to
flatter
the
of
the
northern
tribes
to
his
eyes
joseph
is
the
noblest
of
all
the
sons
of
jacob
before
whom
all
the
rest
must
bow
their
heads
as
to
a
king
next
to
joseph
comes
reuben
to
whom
rather
than
to
he
gives
the
place
as
firstborn
he
groups
his
characters
round
bethel
and
shechem
the
sanctuaries
of
israel
even
abraham
is
represented
as
residing
not
at
hebron
in
judea
but
at
beersheba
a
spot
held
in
deep
veneration
by
pilgrims
belonging
to
the
ten
tribes
it
is
in
his
concept
of
the
supreme
being
however
that
he
differs
most
widely
from
his
predecessors
god
is
according
to
him
widely
removed
from
ordinary
humanity
he
no
longer
reveals
himself
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
but
works
rather
by
night
and
appears
to
men
in
their
dreams
or
when
circumstances
require
his
active
interference
is
content
to
send
his
angels
rather
than
come
in
his
own
person
budde
seems
to
have
proved
conclusively
that
the
elohist
did
not
write
any
part
of
the
primitive
history
of
mankind
xxxvii
xlii
whereas
in
xliii
where
the
narrative
is
from
the
pen
of
the
jehovist
it
is
judah
that
plays
the
principal
part
it
is
possible
that
in
xxxvii
reuben
has
been
substituted
in
the
existing
text
for
judah
xxi
xxii
the
importance
of
beersheba
as
a
holy
place
resorted
to
by
pilgrims
from
the
northern
kingdom
is
shown
in
kings
xix
and
amos
viii

xxviii
xxxi
numb
xxii
indeed
such
cases
of
active
interference
are
of
rare
occurrence
and
he
prefers
to
accomplish
his
purpose
through
human
agents
who
act
unconsciously
or
even
in
direct
contravention
of
their
own
clearly
expressed
intentions
moreover
it
was
only
by
degrees
that
he
revealed
his
true
nature
and
title
the
patriarchs
abraham
isaac
jacob
and
joseph
had
called
him
elohim
or
gods
and
it
was
not
until
the
coming
of
moses
that
he
disclosed
his
real
name
of
jahveh
to
his
worshippers
end
of
the
story
of
joseph
as
for
you
ye
meant
evil
against
me
but
god
meant
it
for
good
to
bring
it
to
pass

it
is

in
a
word
this
new
historian
shows
us
in
every
line
that
the
theological
instinct
has
superseded
popular
enthusiasm
and
his
work
loses
unmistakably
in
literary
interest
by
the
change
we
feel
that
he
is
wanting
in
feeling
and
inspiration
his
characters
no
longer
palpitate
with
life
his
narrative
drags
its
interest
decreases
and
his
language
is
often
deficient
in
force
and
colour
but
while
writers
trained
in
the
schools
of
the
prophets
thus
sought
to
bring
home
to
the
people
the
benefits
which
their
god
had
showered
on
them
the
people
themselves
showed
signs
of
disaffection
towards
him
or
were
at
any
rate
inclined
to
associate
with
him
other
gods
borrowed
from
neighbouring
states
and
to
overlay
the
worship
they
rendered
him
with
ceremonies
and
ideas
inconsistent
with
its
original
purity
the
permanent
division
of
the
nation
into
two
independent
kingdoms
had
had
its
effect
on
their
religion
as
well
as
on
their
political
life
and
had
separated
the
worshippers
into
two
hostile
camps
the
inhabitants
of
judah
still
continued
to
build
altars
on
their
high
places
as
they
had
done
in
the
time
before
david
there
the
devout
prostrated
themselves
before
the
sacred
stones
and
before
the
asherah
or
went
in
unto
the
in
honour
of
astarte
and
in
own
temple
at
jerusalem
they
had
set
up
the
image
of
a
brazen
serpent
to
which
they
paid
homage
the
feeling
however
that
the
patron
deity
of
the
chosen
people
could
have
but
one
recognised
habitation
the
temple
built
for
him
by
solomon
and
that
the
priests
of
this
temple
were
alone
qualified
to
officiate
there
in
an
effective
manner
came
to
prevail
more
and
more
strongly
in
judaea
the
king
indeed
continued
to
offer
sacrifices
and
prayer
there
but
the
common
people
could
no
longer
intercede
with
their
god
except
through
the
agency
of
the
priests
cf
what
we
are
told
of
idolatrous
practices
in
judah
under
rehoboam
and
abraham
kings
xiv
xv
and
of
the
tolerance
of
high
places
by
asa
and
jehoshaphat
kings
xv
xxii
even
at
the
period
now
under
consideration
neither
amaziah
kings
xiv
nor
azariah
kings
xv
showed
any
disposition
to
prohibit
them
the
brazen
serpent
was
still
in
existence
in
the
time
of
hezekiah
at
the
close
of
the
viiith
century
kings
xviii
kings
xvi
where
ahaz
is
described
as
offering
sacrifice
and
giving
instructions
to
the
high
priest
urijah
as
to
the
reconstruction
and
service
of
the
altar
cf
chron
xxvi
where
similar
conduct
on
the
part
of
uzziah
is
recorded
and
where
the
leprosy
by
which
he
was
attacked
is
in
accordance
with
the
belief
of
later
times
represented
as
a
punishment
of
the
sacrilege
committed
by
him
in
attempting
to
perform
the
sacrifice
in
person
the
latter
in
their
turn
tended
to
develop
into
a
close
corporation
of
families
consecrated
for
generations
past
to
the
priestly
office
they
came
in
time
to
form
a
tribe
by
themselves
which
took
rank
among
the
other
tribes
of
israel
and
claimed
levi
one
of
the
twelve
sons
of
jacob
as
its
ancestor
their
head
chosen
from
among
the
descendants
of
zadok
who
had
been
the
first
high
priest
in
the
reign
of
solomon
was
by
virtue
of
his
office
one
of
the
chief
ministers
of
the
crown
and
we
know
what
an
important
part
was
played
by
jehoiadah
in
the
revolution
which
led
to
the
deposition
of
athaliah
the
high
priest
was
however
no
less
subordinate
to
the
supreme
power
than
his
and
the
sanctity
of
his
office
did
not
avail
to
protect
him
from
or
death
if
he
incurred
the
displeasure
of
his
sovereign
he
had
control
over
a
treasury
continually
enriched
by
the
offerings
of
the
faithful
and
did
not
always
turn
his
trust
to
the
best
uses
in
times
of
extreme
distress
the
king
used
to
borrow
from
him
as
a
last
resource
in
order
to
bring
about
the
withdrawal
of
an
invader
or
purchase
the
help
of
a
powerful
ally
the
capital
of
israel
was
of
too
recent
foundation
to
allow
of
its
chapel
royal
becoming
the
official
centre
of
national
worship
the
temple
and
priesthood
of
samaria
never
succeeded
in
effacing
the
prestige
enjoyed
by
the
ancient
oracles
though
in
the
reign
of
both
the
first
and
second
jeroboam
dan
bethel
gilgal
and
mizpah
had
each
its
band
of
chosen
worshippers
in
order
to
form
an
idea
of
the
relative
positions
occupied
by
the
king
and
the
high
priest
we
must
read
what
is
told
of
jehoiadah
and
joash
kings

or
urijah
and
ahaz
kings

the
story
runs
that

even

elijah

elisha

not

this

heretical

to
do

point

do
we
find
a
disagreement

that
is
in
connection
with
the
one
and

holy
of
holies
to
the
possession
of
which
the
southern
kingdom
had
begun
to
lay
claim
in
a
passage
full
of
significance
jahveh
declares
altar
of

thou
shalt
make
unto
me
and
shalt
sacrifice
thereon
thy
burnt
offerings
and
thy
peace
offerings
thy

i

my

will
come
unto

will
bless
thee
and

thou
make
me
an

thou
shalt
not
build
it
of

stones

thou
lift
up
thy

upon

thou
hast
polluted

thou
go

exod

the
patriarchs
and
early
ancestors
of
the
race
had
performed
their
sacrifices
in
the
open
air
on
rude
and
low
altars
differing
widely
from
lofty
and
elaborately
ornamented
erections
like
those
at
jerusalem
which
seem
to
have
borne
a
resemblance
to
the
altars
of
the
egyptians
the
author
of
the
of
the
advises
the
faithful
to
follow
the
example
of
those
great
men
rather
than
that
of
the
lévites
of
judah
nevertheless
this
multiplicity
of
high
places
was
not
without
its
dangers
it
led
the
common
people
to
confuse
jahveh
with
the
idols
of
canaan
and
encouraged
the
spread
of
foreign
superstitions
the
misfortunes
which
had
come
thick
and
fast
upon
the
israelites
ever
since
the
division
of
the
kingdom
had
made
them
only
too
ready
to
seek
elsewhere
that
support
and
consolation
which
they
could
no
longer
find
at
home
the
gods
of
damascus
and
assur
who
had
caused
the
downfall
of
gath
of
calneh
and
of
hamath
those
of
tyre
and
sidon
who
lavished
upon
the
phoenicians
the
wealth
of
the
seas
or
even
the
deities
of
ammon
moab
or
edom
might
well
appear
more
desirable
than
a
being
who
in
spite
of
his
former
promises
seemed
powerless
to
protect
his
own
people
a
number
of
the
israelites
transferred
their
allegiance
to
these
powerful
deities
prostrated
themselves
before
the
celestial
host
flocked
round
the
of
kevan
the
star
of
el
and
carried
the
tabernacles
of
the
king
of
heaven
nor
was
judah
slow
to
follow
their
example
the
prophets
however
did
not
view
their
persistent
in
the
same
light
as
the
common
people
far
from
accepting
it
as
a
proof
of
the
power
of
other
divinities
they
recognised
in
it
a
mark
of
superiority
amos
vi
with
regard
to
the
destruction
of
gath
by
hazael
amos
in
their
eyes
jahveh
was
the
one
god
compared
with
whom
the
pagan
deities
were
no
gods
at
all
and
could
not
even
be
said
to
exist
he
might
had
he
so
willed
it
have
bestowed
his
protection
on
any
one
of
the
numerous
races
whom
he
had
planted
on
the
earth
but
as
a
special
favour
which
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
confer
he
had
chosen
israel
to
be
his
own
people
and
had
promised
them
that
they
should
occupy
canaan
so
long
as
they
kept
free
from
sin
but
israel
had
sinned
israel
had
followed
after
idols
its
misfortunes
were
therefore
but
the
just
penalty
of
its
unfaithfulness
thus
conceived
jahveh
ceased
to
be
merely
the
god
of
a
nation
he
became
the
god
of
the
whole
world
and
it
is
in
the
guise
of
a
universal
deity
that
some
at
any
rate
of
the
prophets
begin
to
represent
him
from
the
time
of
jeroboam
ii
onwards
this
change
of
view
in
regard
to
the
being
of
jahveh
coincided
with
a
no
less
marked
alteration
in
the
character
of
his
prophets
at
first
they
had
taken
an
active
part
in
public
affairs
they
had
thrown
themselves
into
the
political
movements
of
the
time
and
had
often
directed
their
course
by
persuasion
when
persuasion
sufficed
by
violence
when
violence
was
the
only
means
that
was
left
to
them
of
enforcing
the
decrees
of
the
most
high
not
long
before
this
we
find
elisha
secretly
conspiring
against
the
successors
of
ahab
and
taking
a
decisive
part
in
the
revolution
which
set
the
house
of
jehu
on
the
throne
in
place
of
that
of
omri
but
during
the
which
had
elapsed
since
his
death
the
revival
in
the
fortunes
of
israel
and
its
growing
prosperity
under
the
rule
of
an
energetic
king
had
furnished
the
prophets
with
but
few
pretexts
for
interfering
in
the
conduct
of
state
affairs
cf
the
part
taken
by
nathan
in
the
conspiracy
which
raised
solomon
to
the
throne

et
seq
and
previous
to
this
in

as

no

by

is
found

very
late
date
but
in
chronicles
in
addition
to
a
letter
from
elijah
to
jehoram
of
juda
ghron

we
find
a
reference
to
the
commentary
of
the
prophet
iddo
in
the
time
of
abijah
ghron
xiii
and
to
the
of
jehu
the
son
of
hanani
which
is
inserted
in
the
book
of
the
kings
of
chron
xx
in
the
time
of
jehoshaphat
they
no
longer
occupied
themselves
in
resisting
the
king
but
addressed
themselves
to
the
people
pointed
out
the
heinousness
of
their
sins
and
threatened
them
with
the
wrath
of
jahveh
if
they
persisted
in
their
unfaithfulness
they
came
to
be
spiritual
advisers
rather
than
political
partisans
and
orators
rather
than
men
of
action
like
their
predecessors
their
discourses
were
carefully
prepared
beforehand
and
were
written
down
either
by
themselves
or
by
some
of
their
disciples
for
the
benefit
of
posterity
in
the
hope
that
future
generations
would
understand
the
dangers
or
witness
the
catastrophes
which
their
contemporaries
might
not
live
to
see
about
amos
of
tekôa
a
native
of
judaea
suddenly
made
his
appearance
at
bethel
in
the
midst
of
the
festivals
which
pilgrims
had
flocked
to
celebrate
in
the
ancient
temple
erected
to
jahveh
in
one
of
his
animal
forms
the
title
of
the
book
of
amos
fixes
the
date
as
being
the
days
of
uzziah
king
of
judah
and
in
the
days
of
jeroboam
the
son
of
joash
king
of
i
and
the
state
of
affairs
described
by
him
corresponds
pretty
closely
with
what
we
know
of
this
period
most
critics
fix
the
date
somewhere
between
and
but
nearer
than
his
opening
words
filled
the
listening
crowd
with
wonder
high
places
of
isaac
shall
be
desolate
he
proclaimed
the
sanctuaries
of
israel
shall
be
laid
waste
and
i
will
rise
against
the
house
of
jeroboam
with
the
amos
vii
yet
jeroboam
had
by
this
time
gained
all
his
victories
and
never
before
had
the
king
of
samaria
appeared
to
be
more
firmly
seated
on
the
throne
what
then
did
this
intruder
mean
by
introducing
himself
as
a
messenger
of
wrath
in
the
name
of
jahveh
at
the
very
moment
when
jahveh
was
furnishing
his
worshippers
with
abundant
signs
of
his
favour
amaziah
the
priest
of
bethel
interrupted
him
as
he
went
on
to
declare
that
should
die
by
the
sword
and
israel
should
surely
be
led
away
captive
out
of
his
the
king
informed
of
what
was
going
on
ordered
amos
into
exile
and
amaziah
undertook
to
communicate
this
sentence
to
him
thou
seer
go
flee
thee
away
into
the
land
of
judah
and
there
eat
bread
and
prophesy
there
but
prophesy
not
again
any
more
at
bethel
for
it
is
the
sanctuary
and
it
is
a
royal
and
amos
replied
was
no
prophet
neither
was
i
a
son
but
i
was
a
herdman
and
a
dresser
of
sycomore
trees
and
the
lord
took
me
from
following
the
flock
and
the
lord
said
unto
me
go
prophesy
unto
my
people
israel
now
therefore
hear
thou
the
word
of
the
lord
thou
sayest
prophesy
not
against
israel
and
drop
not
thy
word
against
the
house
of
isaac
therefore
thus
saith
the
lord
thy
wife
shall
be
an
harlot
in
the
city
and
thy
sons
and
thy
daughters
shall
fall
by
the
sword
and
thy
land
shall
be
divided
by
line
and
thou
thyself
shalt
die
in
a
land
that
is
unclean
and
israel
shall
surely
be
led
away
captive
out
of
his
amos
vii
this
prophecy
first
expanded
and
then
written
down
with
a
purity
of
diction
and
loftiness
of
thought
which
prove
amos
to
have
been
a
master
of
literary
art
was
widely
circulated
and
gradually
gained
authority
as
portents
indicative
of
the
divine
wrath
began
to
accumulate
such
as
an
earthquake
which
occurred
two
years
after
the
incident
at

then
denouncing
israel
itself
condemned
it
to
the
same
penalties
for
the
same
iniquities
in
vain
did
the
latter
plead
its
privileges
as
the
chosen
people
of
jahveh
and
seek
to
atone
for
its
guilt
by
endless
sacrifices

i
will
take
no

let

roll
down
as

and
righteousness
as
a
mighty
jerome
describes
amos
as
and
sermone
but
modern
writers
are
generally
agreed
that
in
putting
forward
this
view
he
was
influenced
by
the
statement
as
to
the
peasant
origin
of
the
prophet
amos
i
reference
is
made
to
it
by
the
unknown
prophet

words
are

mentioned
in

the
unfaithfulness
of

the
corruption
of
its

pride

had
sealed
its
doom

at
that
moment

avenger
was
at

its
border

assyrian
appointed
to
carry

of

this
conviction
led
him
to
regard
as
possible
and
probable
a
state
of

hoshea
or
hosea
was
regarded
by
the
rabbis
as
the

of

his
writings
were
placed
at
the
head
of
their
collected
works
the
title
of

he
begins

stating
that
he
preached

of

is
a
later
interpolation
the
additional
mention
of

due
to
an
attempted
analogy

familiar
with
the
prophecies
of
amos

his
own
predictions
show
that
the
events
merely
foreseen
by
his
predecessor
were
now
in
course
of
fulfilment

his
day
the
first
three
chapters
probably
date
from
the
end
of
the

of

that
hosea
must
have

the
tone
of

this
hypothesis
is
generally
accepted
by
theologians
the
halo
of
grandeur
and
renown
with
which
jeroboam
had
surrounded

not
hide
its
wretched
and
paltry
character

demands
of

why
he
should
have
seen
fit
to
visit
such
humiliation
on
his
servant
and
persuades
himself
that
the
faithlessness
of
which
he
is
a
victim
is
but
a
feeble
type
of
that
which
jahveh
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
his
people
israel
had
gone
after
strange
gods
and
the
day
of
retribution

i
is
the
story
of

and
his

an
allegory
or
does
it
rest
on
a
basis
of
actual
fact
most
critics
now
seem
to
incline
to
the
view
that
the
prophet
has
here
set
down
an
authentic
episode
from
his
own
career
and
uses
it
to
point
the
moral
of
his
work
whether
the
decadence
of
the
hebrews
was
or
was
not
due
to
the
purely
moral
and
religious
causes
indicated
by
the
prophets
it
was
only
too
real
and
even
the
least
observant
among
their
contemporaries
must
have
suspected
that
the
two
kingdoms
were
quite
unfitted
as
to
their
numbers
their
military
organisation
and
monetary
reserves
to
resist
successfully
any
determined
attack
that
might
be
made
upon
them
by
surrounding
nations
an
armed
force
entering
syria
by
way
of
the
euphrates
could
hardly
fail
to
overcome
any
opposition
that
might
be
offered
to
it
if
not
at
the
first
onset
at
any
rate
after
a
very
brief
struggle
none
of
the
minor
states
to
be
met
upon
its
way
such
as
damascus
or
israel
much
less
those
of
hamath
or
hadrach
were
any
longer
capable
of
barring
its
progress
as
and
hazael
had
arrested
that
of
the
assyrians
in
the
time
of
shalmaneser
iii
the
efforts
then
made
by
the
syrian
kings
to
secure
their
independence
had
exhausted
their
resources
and
worn
out
the
spirit
of
their
peoples
civil
war
had
prevented
them
from
making
good
their
losses
during
the
afforded
by
the
decadence
of
assyria
and
now
that
nature
herself
had
afflicted
them
with
the
crowning
misfortunes
of
famine
and
pestilence
they
were
reduced
to
a
mere
shadow
of
what
they
had
been
during
the
previous
century
if
therefore
sharduris
after
making
himself
master
of
the
countries
of
the
taurus
and
amanos
had
turned
his
steps
towards
the
valley
of
the
orontes
he
might
have
secured
possession
of
it
without
much
difficulty
and
after
that
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
prevent
his
soldiers
from
pressing
on
if
need
be
to
the
walls
of
samaria
or
even
of
jerusalem
itself
indeed
he
seems
to
have
at
last
made
up
his
mind
to
embark
on
this
venture
when
the
revival
of
assyrian
power
put
a
stop
to
his
ambitious
schemes
hard
pressed
on
every
side
by
daring
and
restless
foes
began
by
attacking
those
who
were
at
once
the
most
troublesome
and
most
vulnerable
the
aramæan
tribes
on
the
banks
of
the
tigris
to
give
these
incorrigible
banditti
who
boldly
planted
their
outposts
not
a
score
of
leagues
from
his
capital
a
free
hand
on
his
rear
and
brave
the
fortune
of
war
in
armenia
or
syria
without
first
teaching
them
a
lesson
in
respect
would
have
been
simply
to
court
serious
disaster
an
aramæan
raid
occurring
at
a
time
when
he
was
engaged
elsewhere
with
the
bulk
of
his
army
might
have
made
it
necessary
to
break
off
a
successful
campaign
and
fall
back
in
haste
to
the
relief
of
nineveh
or
calah
kalakh
just
as
he
was
on
the
eve
of
gaining
some
decisive
advantage
moreover
the
suzerainty
of
assyria
over
karduniash
entailed
on
him
the
duty
of
safeguarding
babylon
from
that
other
horde
of
aramæans
which
harassed
it
on
the
east
while
the
kaldâ
were
already
threatening
its
southern
frontier
it
is
not
quite
clear
whether
nabunazîr
who
then
occupied
the
throne
implored
his
help
at
any
rate
he
took
the
field
as
soon
as
he
felt
that
his
own
crown
was
secure
overthrew
the
aramæans
at
the
first
encounter
and
drove
them
back
from
the
banks
of
the
lower
zab
to
those
of
the
uknu
all
the
countries
which
they
had
seized

bowed
down

him
but
he
abstained
from
giving
any
provocation
to
the
kaldâ
and
satisfied
with
having
convinced
nabunazîr
that
assyria
had
lost
none
of
her
former
vigour
he
made
his
way
back
to
his
hereditary
kingdom
most
historians
believe
that
entered
karduniash
as
an
enemy
that
he
captured
several
towns
and
allowed
the
others
to
ransom
themselves
on
payment
of
tribute
the
way
in
which
the
texts
known
to
us
refer
to
this
expedition
seems
to
me
however
to
prove
that
he
set
out
as
an
ally
and
protector
of
nabonazir
and
that
his
visit
to
the
babylonian
sanctuaries
was
of
a
purely
pacific
nature
the
success
of
this
expedition
produced
the
result
had
set
out
a
king
but
now
that
the
gods
of
the
ancient
sanctuaries
had
declared
themselves
satisfied
with
his
homage
and
had
granted
him
that
religious
consecration
which
had
before
been
lacking
he
returned
a
king
de
jure
as
well
his
next
campaign
completed
what
the
first
had
begun
the
subjugation
of
the
plain
would
have
been
of
little
advantage
if
the
highlands
had
been
left
in
the
power
of
tribes
as
yet
unconquered
and
allowed
to
pour
down
with
impunity
bands
of
rapacious
freebooters
on
the
newly
liberated
provinces
security
between
the
zab
and
the
uknu
could
only
be
attained
by
the
pacification
of
namri
and
it
was
therefore
to
namri
that
the
sea
of
war
was
transferred
in
all
the
cossæan
and
babylonian

victory
the

the
brilliant
campaigns
of

had
invested
its
name
if
somewhat
diminished
had
still
survived
its
recent
reverses
and
the
terror
inspired
by
its
arms
was
so
great
even
among
races
who
had
witnessed
them
from
a
distance
that
the
image
of
assyria
rose
involuntarily
before
the
eyes
of
the
hebrew
prophets
as
that
of
the
avenger
destined
to
punish
israel
for
its
excesses
cf
amos
vi
no
doubt
during
the
last
few
reigns
its
prosperity
had
waned
and
its
authority
over
distant
provinces
had
gradually
become
relaxed
but
now
the
old
dynasty
worn
out
by
its
own
activity
had
given
place
to
a
new
one
and
with
this
change
of
rulers
the
tide
of
was
perhaps
at
last
about
to
turn
at
such
a
juncture
a
successful
campaign
meant
full
compensation
for
all
past
disasters
and
the
attainment
of
a
firmer
position
than
had
ever
yet
been
held
whereas
another
reverse
following
on
those
from
which
the
empire
had
already
suffered
would
render
their
effect
tenfold
more
deadly
and
by
letting
loose
the
hatred
of
those
whom
fear
alone
still
held
in
check
complete
its
overthrow
it
was
essential
therefore
before
entering
on
the
struggle
to
weigh
well
every
chance
of
victory
and
to
take
every
precaution
by
which
adverse
contingencies
might
be
as
far
as
possible
eliminated
the
army
encouraged
by
its
success
in
the
two
preceding
campaigns
was
in
excellent
fighting
order
and
ready
to
march
in
any
direction
without
a
hesitation
confident
in
its
ability
to
defeat
the
forces
of
urartu
as
it
had
defeated
those
of
the
medes
and
aramæans
but
the
precise
point
of
attack
needed
careful
consideration
must
have
been
sorely
tempted
to
take
the
shortest
route
challenge
the
enemy
at
his
most
vulnerable
point
on
the
shores
of
lake
van
and
by
a
thrust
deal
him
a
blow
from
which
he
would
never
or
only
by
slow
degrees
recover
but
this
vital
region
of
urartu
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
presented
the
greatest
difficulties
of
access
the
rampart
of
mountain
and
forest
by
which
it
was
protected
on
the
assyrian
side
could
only
be
traversed
by
means
of
a
few
byways
along
which
bands
of
guerrillas
could
slip
down
easily
enough
to
the
banks
of
the
tigris
but
which
were
quite
impassable
to
any
army
in
full
marching
order
hampered
by
its
horses
chariots
and
compelled
to
thread
its
way
with
columns
unduly
extended
through
the
woods
and
passes
of
an
unknown
country
which
daily
use
had
long
made
familiar
to
its
adversaries
it
would
have
run
the
risk
of
being
cut
to
pieces

by
man
a
dozen
times
before
it
could
hope
to
range
its
disciplined
masses
on
the
field
of

former
assyrian
invasions
had
as
a
general
rule
taken
an
oblique
course
towards
some
of
the
spurs
of
this
formidable
chain
and
had
endeavoured
to
neutralise
its
defences
by
outflanking
them
either
by
proceeding
westwards
along
the
basins
of
the
supnat
and
the
arzania
or
eastwards
through
the
countries
bordering
on
lake
urumiah
but
even
this
method
presented
too
many
difficulties
and
too
little
certainty
of
success
to
warrant
in
staking
the
reviving
fortunes
of
his
empire
on
its
adoption
he
rightly
argued
that
sharduris
would
be
most
easily
vulnerable
in
those
provinces
whose
allegiance
to
him
was
of
recent
date
and
he
resolved
to
seek
out
his
foe
in
the
heart
of
northern
syria

the

operations
while
it
had
long
been
familiar
to
his
own
generals
and
soldiers
was
on
the
other
hand
entirely
new
ground
to
those
of
the
enemy
the
latter
though
unsurpassed
in
mountain
warfare
lost
much
of
their
superiority
on
the
plains
and
could
not
with
all
their
courage
make
up
for
their
lack
of
experience
moreover
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
a
victory
on
the
banks
of
the
afrîn
or
the
orontes
would
have
more
important
results
than
a
success
gained
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
lakes
or
of
urartu
not
only
would
it
free
the
assyrians
from
the
only
one
of
their
enemies
whom
they
had
any
cause
to
fear
but
it
would
also
bring
back
the
hittite
kings
to
their
allegiance
and
restore
the
assyrian
supremacy
over
the
wealthiest
regions
of
western
asia
they
would
thus
disable
urartu
and
reconquer
syria

of
neither

nor

daring
to
interfere
with
his
progress
he
thus
advanced
as
far
as
arpad
and
in
the
first
moment
of
surprise
the
town
threw
open
its
gates
before
him
different
writers
have
given
different
versions
of
this
campaign
some
think
that
arpad
resisted
and
that
pileser
was
laying
siege
to
it
when
the
arrival
of
sharduris
compelled
him
to
retire
others
prefer
to
believe
that
arpad
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
assyrians
and
that
used
it
as
his
base
of
operations
the
formula
ina
arpadda
in
the
eponym
canon
proves
that
pileser
was
certainly
in
arpad
since
arpad
belonged
to
the
and
they
were
the
allies
or
vassals
of
sharduris
we
must
assume
as
i
have
done
here
that
in
the
absence
of
the
urartians
they
did
not
dare
to
resist
the
assyrians
and
opened
their
gates
to
them
there
while
he
was
making
ready
to
claim
the
homage
of
the
surrounding
countries
he
learnt
that
sharduris
was
hastening
up
to
the
rescue
he
at
once
struck
his
camp
and
marched
out
to
meet
his
rival
coming
up
with
him
in
the
centre
of
kummukh
not
far
from
the
euphrates
between
kishtân
and
khalpi
sharduris
was
at
the
head
of
his
syrian
contingents
including
the
forces
of
agusi
melitene
kummukh
and
gurgum
a
formidable
army
probably
superior
in
point
of
numbers
to
that
of
the
assyrians
the
struggle
lasted
a
whole
day
and
in
the
course
of
it
the
two
kings
catching
sight
of
one
another
on
the
field
of
battle
engaged
in
personal
combat
at
last
towards
evening
the
chariots
and
cavalry
of
urartu
gave
way
and
the
rout
began
the
victors
made
their
way
into
the
camp
at
the
heels
of
their
flying
enemies
sharduris
abandoned
his
chariot
and
could
find
nothing
but
a
mare
to
aid
him
in
his
flight
he
threw
himself
upon
her
back
careless
of
the
ridicule
at
that
time
attached
to
the
use
of
such
a
mount
in
eastern
countries
fled
at
a
gallop
all
through
the
night
hard
pressed
by
a
large
body
of
cavalry
crossed
the
hills
of
sibak
and
with
much
difficulty
reached
the
bridge
over
the
euphrates
so
too
later
on
in
the
time
of
sargon
rusas
when
defeated
gets
on
the
back
of
a
mare
and
rides
off
his
pursuers
drew
rein
on
the
and
sharduris
his
kingdom
in
safety
he
had
lost
nearly
men
killed
or
taken
prisoners
in
addition
to
his
chariots
and
nearly
the
whole
train
of
horses
asses
servants
and
artisans
attached
to
his
army
he
left
his
tent
still
standing
and
those
who
were
first
to
enter
it
laid
hands
on
his
furniture
and
effects
his
royal
ornaments
his
bed
and
portable
throne
with
its
cushions
and
none
of
which
had
he
found
time
to
take
with
him
burnt
them
all
on
the
spot
as
a
to
the
gods
who
had
so
signally
favoured
him
the
bed
alone
he
retained
in
order
that
he
might
dedicate
it
as
a
trophy
to
the
goddess
ishtar
of
nineveh
he
had
covered
himself
with
glory
and
might
well
be
proud
of
his
achievement
yet
the
victory
was
in
no
way
a
decisive
one
the
damage
inflicted
on
the
allies
considerable
though
it
was
had
cost
him
dear
the
forces
left
to
him
were
not
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
finish
the
campaign
and
extort
oaths
of
allegiance
from
the
syrian
princes
before
they
had
recovered
from
the
first
shock
of
defeat
he
returned
to
nineveh
and
spent
the
whole
winter
in
reorganising
his
troops
while
his
enemies
on
the
other
hand
made
preparations
to
repel
the
attack
energetically
sharduris
could
not
yet
venture
outside
his
mountain
strongholds
but
the
hope
of
being
reinforced
by
him
as
soon
as
he
had
got
together
another
army
encouraged
the
syrian
kings
to
remain
faithful
to
him
in
spite
of
his
reverses

part
played
by

no

astonish
us
now
that
we

observations
made
on

the
marvellous
skill
displayed
in
the
fortification
of
these
asiatic
towns
the
ruins
of

have
yet
to
be
explored
but
those
of
samalla
have
been
excavated
and
show
us
the
methods
adopted
for
the
defence
of
a
royal
residence
about
the
middle
of
the
century
with
which
we
are
now
concerned
the
practice
of
building
citadels
on
a
square
or
rectangular
plan
which
prevailed
so
largely
under
the
egyptian
rule
had
gradually
gone
out
of
fashion
as
the
knowledge
of
engineering
advanced
and
the
use
of
mines
and
military
engines
had
been
more
fully
developed
among
the
nations
of
western
asia
it
was
found
that
the
heavily
fortified
angles
of
the
enclosing
wall
merely
presented
so
many
weak
points
easy
to
attack
but
difficult
to
defend
no
matter
how
carefully
they
might
be
protected
by
an
accumulation
of
obstacles
in
the
case
of
fortresses
built
on
a
plain
where
the
plan
was
not
modified
by
the
nature
of
the
site
the
enclosing
wall
was
generally
round
or
oval
in
shape
and
free
from
useless
angles
which
might
detract
from
its
strength
the
walls
were
surmounted
by
battlements
and
flanked
at
short
intervals
by
round
or
square
towers
the
tops
of
which
rose
but
little
if
indeed
at
all
above
the
level
of
the
curtain
in
front
of
this
main
wall
was
a
second
lower
one
also
furnished
with
towers
and
battlements
which
followed
the
outline
of
the
first
all
the
way
round
at
an
interval
of
some
yards
thus
acting
as
a
sort
of
continuous
screen
to
it
the
gates
were
little
less
than
miniature
citadels
built
into
each
line
of
ramparts
the
gate
of
the
outer
wall
was
often
surrounded
by
lower
outworks
two
square
bastions
and
walls
enclosing
an
outer
quadrangle
which
had
to
be
crossed
before
the
real
gate
was
reached

of
artificial

stood
the

castle

on
the
part
of
its
garrison
would
make
it
necessary
for
the
enemy
to
undertake
a
second
siege
no
less
deadly

protracted
than
the

knew

could
hope
for
no
mercy
at

of
the
assyrians
he
therefore
struggled
on
to
the
last
and
when
at
length
obliged
to
surrender
in
the
year
he
paid
for
his
obstinacy
by
the
loss
of
his
throne
and
perhaps
also
of
his
life

these

to
which
it
still
clung

wrested

may

recalled
to
the

in
the
year
the
petty
kings
who
shared
with
assyria
the
possession
of
the
mountains
and
plains
of
the
afrîn
could
not
succeed
in
living
at
peace
with
one
another
and
every
now
and
then
their
disputes
broke
out
into
open
warfare
samalla
was
at
that
time
subject
to
a
family
of
which
the
first
members
known
to
history
qaral
and
panammu
shared
yaudi
equally
between
them
barzur
son
of
panammu
had
reigned
there
since
about
and
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
he
must
have
passed
through
the
same
vicissitudes
as
his
neighbours
faithful
to
urartu
as
long
as
sharduris
kept
the
upper
hand
and
to
assyria
as
soon
as
had
humiliated
urartu
he
had
been
killed
in
a
skirmish
by
some
rival
his
son
panammu
il
came
to
the
throne
merely
as
a
nominee
of
his
suzerain
and
seems
to
have
always
rendered
him
faithful
service
unfortunately
yaudi
was
no
longer
subject
to
the
house
of
panammu
but
obeyed
the
rule
of
a
certain
azriyahu
who
chafed
at
the
presence
of
an
alien
power
azriyahu
of
yaudi
was
identified
with
azariah
of
judah
by
smith
and
this
identification
was
for
a
long
time
accepted
without
question
by
most
assyriologists
after
a
violent
controversy
it
has
finally
been
shown
that
the
of
inscriptions
ought
to
be
identified
with
the
or
of
the
zinjirli
inscriptions
and
consequently
that
azriyahu
was
not
king
of
judah
but
a
king
of
northern
syria
this
view
appears
to
me
to
harmonise
so
well
with
what
remains
of
the
texts
and
with
our
knowledge
of
the
events
that
i
have
had
no
hesitation
in
adopting
it
azriyahu
took
advantage
of
the
events
which
kept
fully
occupied
in
the
east
to
form
a
coalition
in
favour
of
himself
among
the
states
on
the
banks
of
the
orontes
including
some
seventeen
provinces
dependencies
of
hamath
and
certain
turbulent
cities
of
northern
phoenicia
such
as
byblos
arka
zimyra
usnû
siannu
and
even
hadrach
itself
it
is
not
quite
clear
whether
damascus
and
the
hebrews
took
part
in
this
movement
jeroboam

died
in
after
a
prosperous
reign
of
years
and
on
his
death
israel
seems
to
have
fallen
under
a
cloud
six
months
later
his
son
zechariah
was
assassinated
at

son
of
jabesh
and

prophecy
of

in
which
he
declared
that

have
made
himself
master
of
the
kingdom
little
by
little
the
success
of
his
usurpation
being
entirely
due
to
the
ruthless
energy
invariably
and
everywhere
displayed
by
him
as
for
instance
when
tappuakh
tiphsah
refused
to
open
its
gates
at
his
summons
he
broke
into
the
town
and
slaughtered
its
inhabitants

to
be

and

ever
since
the
expedition
of
sheshonq
into
asia
egypt
seemed
to
have
lost
all
interest
in
foreign
politics
osorkon
had
not
inherited
the
warlike
propensities
of
his
father
and
his
son
takelôti
and
his
grandson
osorkon
followed
his
example
the
chronology
of
this
period
is
still
very
uncertain
and
the
stelae
of
the
serapseum
which
enable
us
to
fix
the
order
of
the
various
reigns
yield
no
information
as
to
their
length
sheshonq
did
not
reign
much
longer
than
years
which
is
his
latest
known
date
and
we
may
take
the
reign
of
years
attributed
to
him
by
manetho
as
being
substantially
correct
the
latest
dates
we
possess
are
as
follows
osorkon
twelfth
year
and
takelôti
sixth
year
or
seventh
year
lastly
we
have
a
year
in
the
case
of
osorkon
with
a
reference
in
the
case
of
the
year
to
the
fifth
year
of
a
takelôti
whose
first
cartouche
is
missing
and
who
perhaps
died
before
his
father
and
in
manetho
osorkon
is
credited
with
a
reign
of
fifteen
years
and
his
three
next
successors
with
a
total
of
years
between
them
which
is
manifestly
incorrect
since
the
monuments
give
years
or
at
the
very
least
if
we
take
into
account
the
double
date
in
the
case
of
the
first
two
of
these
kings
the
wisest
course
seems
to
be
to
allow
years
to
osorkon
and
his
two
successors
if
sheshonq
as
i
believe
died
in
the
fifty
years
allotted
to
the
next
three
pharaohs
would
bring
us
down
to
and
it
is
in
this
year
that
i
am
for
the
present
inclined
to
place

death
of

of

we

the

in

was
secretly
fomented
by

by

numerous

boasted
of
their

from

hereditary
claims
to

it
was
not
till
some
time
after
between
the
fifteenth
and

of

that
they
finally
laid
down
their
arms
at
the
end
of
this
struggle
the
power
was
quite
exhausted
while
that
of
the
feudal
magnates
had
proportionately
increased
before

egypt
was
split
up

states
some
of
them
containing

a
few

others
following
the
example
of

boldly
annexed
several
adjacent

a
last
remnant
of
respect
for
the
traditional
monarchy
kept
them
from
entirely
repudiating
the
authority
of
pharaoh
they
still
kept
up
an
outward
show
of
submission
to
his
rule
they
paid
him
military
service
when
called
upon
and
appealed
to
him
as
umpire
in
their
disputes
without
however
always
accepting
his
rulings
and
when
they
actually
came
to
blows
among
themselves
were
content
to
exercise
their
right
of
private
warfare
under
his
direction
the
royal
domain
gradually
became
narrowed
down
to
the
memphite
nome
and
the
private
appanages
of
the
reigning
house
and
soon
it
no
longer
yielded
the
sums
necessary
for
the
due
performance
of
costly
religious
ceremonies
such
as
the
enthronement
or
burial
of
an

the
pomp
and
luxury
usually
displayed

grew
less
and
less
under

the
later
kings
of
the
xxiind
dynasty
had
fallen
the
fact
that
the
chapel
and

were
built
under
their
direction
shows
that
they
were
still
masters
of

have
no

we
know
that

reigned
two
years

years
of

we
find
a
reference
to
the
year
of
sheshonq

if
we
allow
a
round
century
for
these
last
kings
we
are
not

to
be

place

the

did
their
very
utmost
to
appease
their
wrath
before
he
appeared
on

they
told
off
a

to
keep
watch
over

they
themselves
marched

they
took
oxyrrhynchos
by

with
fury

informed
the
king
of
this
achievement
but
heart
was
not
softened
they
crossed
over
to
the
right

they
crushed
the
people
of
the
north
under
the

of
tatehni

forced
the

of

inhabitants
amongst
others
a
son
of
tafnakhti
whose
body
they
sent
to
the
king

heart
was
not
softened
they
then
pushed
on
as
far
as

sacked
it

still
failed

regain

who
constructed

at

and
now
only
a

shapeless
fragments
of
it
remain
he
then
made
his
way
to
the
palace
and
inspected
its
courts
chambers
treasury
and
storehouses
and
reviewed
the
whole
household
including
even
own

and
daughters
though
turned
not
his
face
towards
any
one
of
he
next
went
on
to
the
and
was
indignant
to
find
that
the
horses
had
suffered
from
hunger
during
the
siege
thoroughbreds
were
probably
somewhat
scarce
at
napata
and
he
had
no
doubt
reckoned
on
obtaining
new
blood
and
a
complete
relay
of

from
the

his
chances

doing
so
seemed
likely
to
vanish

commanded

the
son
of

agreed
to
surrender
it
provided
he
were
allowed
to
march
out
with
the
honours
of

this
fortress
which
bears
a
name
compounded
with
that
of
osorkon
must
have
been
rebuilt
by
that
monarch
on
the
site
of
an
earlier
fort
the
new
name
remained
in
use
under
the
xxiind
and
xxiiith
dynasties
after
which
the
old
one
reappears
it
is
illahun
where
petrie
discovered
the
remains
of
a
flourishing
town
of
the
bubastite
epoch
shortly
after
maîtumu
threw
open
its
gates
and
its
example
was
followed
by
titauî
at
maîtumu
there
was
rioting
among
the
egyptians
in
the
streets
one
party
wishing
to
hold
out
the
other
to
surrender
but
in
the
end
the
latter
had
their
way
piônkhi
discharged
his
priestly
duties
wherever
he
went
and
received
the
local
taxes
always
being
careful
to
reserve
a
tenth
for
the
treasury
of
the
fact
that
his
army
was
kept
under
rigid
control
and
that
he
showed
great
clemency
to
the
vanquished
helped
largely
to
conciliate
those
who
were
not
bound
by
close
ties
of
interest
to
the
cause
of
tafnakhti
on
reaching
memphis
piônkhi
at
once
had
recourse
to
the
persuasive
methods
which
had
hitherto
served
him
so
well
and
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
garrison
not
yourselves
up
in
forts
and
fight
not
against
the
upper
country
for
shu
the
god
of
creation
when
i
enter
he
entereth
and
when
i
go
out
he
goeth
out
and
none
may
repel

attacks
i
will
present
offerings
to
phtah
and
to
the
divinities
of

i
will
honour

mysterious
coffer
i
will
contemplate

i
will
return
from
thence
in
peace
if
ye
will
trust
in

memphis
shall
be
prosperous
and
healthy
even
the
children
shall
not
cry
therein
behold
the
nomes
of

not
a

been
massacred
there
saving
only
the
impious

blasphemed

and
these
rebels
have
been
maritumu
or
maîtumu
is
the
modern
meîdum
associated
in
the
inscription
with
the
characteristic
epithet
or
of
sokari
master
of
the
titauî
lay
exactly
on
the
frontier
between
upper
and
lower
egypt
hence
its
name
which
signifies
the
two
regions
it
was
in
the
memphite
nome
and
brugsch
identifies
it
with
the
greek
city
of
acanthos
near
dahshur
but
this
position
appears
to
me
to
be
too
close
to
memphis
and
too
far
from
the
boundary
of
the
nome
i
should
prefer
to
place
titauî
at
kafr
or
thereabouts
against
piônkhi
who
was
master
of
the
upper
country
that
is
of
thebes
and
ethiopia
and
the
forces
from
the
whole
of
the
valley
to
the
south
of
memphis
who
accompanied
him
who
is
on
the
south
of
his
wall
a
name
given
to
one
of
the
quarters
of
memphis
and
afterwards
applied
to
the
god
phtah
who
was
worshipped
in
that
quarter
this
eloquence
however
was
of
no
avail
a
detachment
of
archers
sailors
and
engineers
sent
to
make
a
reconnaissance
of
the
harbour
was
taken
by
surprise
and
routed
with
loss
and
on
the
following
night
tafnakhti
suddenly
made
his
appearance
on
the
spot
he
had
the
men
who
were
defending
it
paraded
before
him
and
made
them
a
speech
in
which
he
pointed
out
the
great
natural
strength
of
the
position
the
stoutness
of
the
walls
and
the
abundance
of
provisions
he
then
mounted
his
horse
and
making
his
way
a
second
time
through
the
outposts
headed
straight
for
the
delta
in
order
to
levy
reinforcements
there
the
next
day
piônkhi
went
in
person
to
examine
the
approaches
of
the
city
in
which
his
ancestors
had
once
been
throned
there
was
a
full
nile
and
the
river
came
right
up
to
the
walls
he
sailed
close
in
along
the
whole
of
the
eastern
front
and
landed
on
the
north
much
vexed
and
discomfited
at
finding
it
so
strongly
fortified
even
the
common
soldiers
were
astonished
and
began
to
discuss
among
themselves
the
difficulties
of
the
undertaking
with
a
certain
feeling
of
discouragement
it
would
be
necessary
they
declared
to
open
a
regular
siege
make
an
inclined
plane
leading
to
the
city
throw
earthworks
against
its
walls
bind
ladders
set
up
masts
and
erect
spars
all
around
piônkhi
burst
into
a
rage
when
these
remarks
were
repeated
to
him
a
siege
in
set
form
would
have
been
a
most
serious
enterprise
and
would
have
allowed
the
allied
princes
time
to
get
together
fresh
troops
he
drove
his
ships
full
speed
against
the
line
of
boats
anchored
in
the
harbour
and
broke
through
it
at
the
first
onset
his
sailors
then
scaled
the
bank
and
occupied
the
houses
which
overlooked
it
reinforcements
concentrated
on
this
point
gradually
penetrated
into
the
heart
of
the
city
and
after
two
fighting
the
garrison
threw
down
their
arms
the
victor
at
once
occupied
the
temples
to
save
them
from
pillage
he
then
purified
memphis
with
water
and
natron
ascended
in
triumph
to
the
temple
of
phtah
and
celebrated
there
those
rites
which
the
king
alone
was
entitled
to
perform
the
other
fortresses
in
the
neighbourhood
surrendered
without
further
hesitation
king
auputi
of
tentramu
prince
akaneshu
and
prince
petisis
tendered
the
homage
of
their
subjects
in
person
and
the
other
sovereigns
of
the
delta
merely
waited
for
a
demonstration
in
force
on
the
part
of
the
ethiopians
before
following
their
example
probably
the
original
of
the
statue
discovered
by
naville
at
tentramu
and
taânu
the
cities
of
auputi
are
perhaps
identical
with
the
biblical
elim
exod
xvi
and
the
daneon
portus
of
pliny
on
the
red
sea
but
naville
prefers
to
identify
daneon
with
the
tonu
of
the
papyrus
no
i
believe
that
we
ought
to
look
for
the
kingdom
of
auputi
in
the
neighbourhood
of
menzaleh
near
tanis
akaneshu
ruled
over
sebennytos
and
in
the
xviith
nome
naville
discovered
at
samannud
the
statue
of
one
of
his
descendants
a
king
of
the
same
name
perhaps
his
grandson
who
was
prince
of
sebennytos
in
the
time
of
psammetichus
piônkhi
crossed
the
nile
and
marched
in
state
to
heliopolis
there
to
receive
the
royal
investiture
he
offered
up
prayers
at
the
various
holy
places
along
the
route
such
as
the
sanctuary
of
tumu
at
khriâhu
and
the
temple
of
the
ennead
who
dwelt
in
the
cavern
from
which
the
northern
nile
was
supposed
to
spring
he
then
crossed
over
mount
ahu
bathed
his
face
in
the
reputed
source
of
the
river
and
at
length
penetrated
into
the
of
râ
he
ascended
the
steps
leading
to
the
great
chapel
in
order
that
he
might
there
râ
in
even
himself
all
unattended
he
drew
the
bolt
threw
open
the
doors
contemplated
his
father
râ
in
adjusted
boat
mâdît
and
the
saktit
of
shu
then
closed
the
doors
again
affixed
a
seal
of
clay
and
impressed
it
with
the
royal
he
had
thus
submitted
his
conduct
for
the
approval
of
the
god
in
whom
all
attributes
of
royalty
were
vested
and
the
god
had
legitimatised
his
claims
to
universal
rule
he
was
henceforth
the
master
not
merely
but
as
well
and
the
kings
who
had
hitherto
declined
to
recognise
him
were
now
obliged
to
bow
reverently
before
his
authority
osorkon
was
the
first
to
submit
and
did
so
before
the
close
of
stay
at
heliopolis
when
the
latter
pitched
his
camp
near
in
the
athribite
nome
the
nobles
of
the
eastern
delta
both
small
and
great
came
one
after
another
with
their
followers
among
them
patinifi
of
pisapti
paimau
of
busiris
pabîsa
of
khriâhu
and
of
pihâpi
besides
a
dozen
others

perhaps
the
modern
kaha
some
distance
to
the
north
of
qaliub
pisapti
stood
on
the
present
site
of
khriâhu
as
we
know
formed
part
of
the
heliopolitan
nome
and
is
very
possibly
to
be
identified
with
babylon
of
egypt
the
postât
of
the
arabs
pihâpi
was
a
place
not
far
from
the
supposed
source
of
the
southern
nile
he
extended
his
favour
to
all
alike
merely
stipulating
that
they
should
give
him
the
best
of
their
horses
and
undertake
to
keep
careful
watch
over
the
prosperity
of
their
stud
farms
but
tafnakhti
still
held
out
and
seemed
determined
to
defy
him
to
the
end
he
had
set
fire
to
his
palace
and
taken
refuge
in
the
islands
on
the
river
and
had
provided
a
for
himself
at
masudît
among
the
marshes
on
the
coast
in
case
of
final
defeat
a
victory
gained
over
him
by
the
ethiopian
generals
suddenly
induced
him
to
sue
for
peace
he
offered
to
disband
his
men
and
pay
tribute
provided
he
was
guaranteed
undisturbed
possession
of
sais
and
of
the
western
districts
of
the
delta
he
refused
however
to
sue
for
pardon
in
person
and
asked
that
an
envoy
should
be
sent
to
receive
his
oath
of
allegiance
in
the
temple
of
nit
though
deserted
by
his
brother
princes
and
allies
he
still
retained
sufficient
power
to
be
a
thorn
in
his
side
his
ultimate
overthrow
was
certain
but
it
would
have
entailed
many
a
bloody
struggle
while
a
defeat
might
easily
have
shaken
the
fidelity
of
the
other
feudatory
kings
and
endangered
the
stability
of
the
new
dynasty
piônkhi
therefore
accepted
the
terms
offered
him
without
modification
and
asked
for
no
guarantee
beyond
the
oath
taken
in
the
presence
of
the
gods
news
was
brought
him
about
this
time
that
cynopolis
and
aphroditopolis
had
at
last
thrown
open
their
gates
and
accordingly
he
summoned
his
vassals
for
the
last
time
to
his
camp
near
athribis
with
the
exception
of
tafnakhti
they
all
obeyed
the
call
including
two
minor
kings
of
upper
and
two
of
lower
egypt
together
with
barons
of
lesser
rank
but
of
these
namrôti
alone
was
admitted
to
the
royal
apartments
because
he
alone
was
circumcised
and
ate
no
fish
after
this
the
camp
was
broken
up
and
the
ethiopians
set
out
on
their
return
journey
southwards
piônkhi
may
well
have
been
proud
of
the
result
of
this
campaign
both
for
himself
and
for
his
country
the
empire
of
the
pharaohs
which
had
for
the
last
hundred
and
fifty
years
been
divided
was
now
from
the
confluence
of
the
niles
to
the
shores
of
the

after

of
ethiopia
to
rule
and
the
seat

was
transferred

no

it

we
are
often
tempted
to
conclude
when
we
come
to
measure
these
revolutions
by

of

had
succeeded

a
very
long

had
no

persisted
so
effectively
that

give
to
the
precedence
over
the

of

the

continued
to
be
the

was
his

psamutis
who
was
regarded
as
the
lord
of

tafnakhti

in

gained
formal
recognition
of

was
no

were

rested

piônkhi

him
amnesty
had
conferred
official
investiture
on
him

on
his
descendants
henceforth
his
rule
at

was
every
whit
as
legitimate
as
that
of
osorkon
at
bubastis
and
he
was
not
slow
in
furnishing
material
proof
of
this
for
he
granted
himself
cartouches
the
uraeus
and
all
the
other
insignia
of
royalty
these
changes
must
have
been
quickly
noised
abroad
throughout

commercial
intercourse
between
syria
and
egypt
was
maintained
as
actively
as
ever
and
the

and

exported
with
regularity
the

of

as
well
as
the
natural
products
of

or
of

the
tidings
of

ethiopian
conquest
and
of
the
of
an
undivided

as
they
did
at
the
very
moment
when
the
first
effects
of
the
assyrian
revival
began
to
be
so
keenly
felt
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
attention
and
arouse
the
hopes
of
syrian
statesmen
the
philistines
who
had
never
entirely
released
themselves
from
the
ties
which
bound
them
to
the
pharaohs
of
the
delta
felt
no
repugnance
at
asking
for
a
renewal
of
their
former
protection

disposed

fact
that
egypt
was
torn
by
domestic
dissensions

divided
into
a
score
of
rival
principalities
in
no
way
diminished
their
traditional
admiration
for
its
wealth

their
confidence
in

power
assyria
itself
was
merely
an
agglomeration
of
turbulent
provinces
vassal
cities
and
minor
kingdoms
artificially
grouped
round
the
ancient
domain
of
assur
and
yet
the
convulsions
by
which
it
was
periodically
shaken
had
not
prevented
it
from
developing
into
the
most
formidable
engine
of
war
that
had
ever
threatened
the
peace
of
asia
the
african
hosts
whether
led
by
ordinary
generals
or
by
a
king
of
secondary
rank
formed
none
the
less
a
compact
army
well
fitted
by
numbers
and
organisation
to
hold
its
own
against
any
forces
which
might
put
into
the
field
and
even
should
the
supreme
pharaoh
be
unwilling
to
throw
the
full
weight
of
his
authority
into
the
balance
yet
an
alliance
with
one
of
the
lesser
kings
such
as
the
lord
of
sais
or
of
bubastis
would
be
of
inestimable
assistance
to
any
one
fortunate
enough
to
secure
it
it
is
true
that
in
so
far
as
the
ultimate
issue
was
concerned
there
was
little
to
be
gained
by
thus
pitting
the
two
great
powers
together
and
persuading
one
to
fight
against
the
other
the
victor
must
in
the
long
run
remain
master
alike
of
those
who
had
appealed
for
help
and
of
those
who
had
fought
against
him
and
if
egypt
emerged
triumphant
there
would
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
accept
her
supremacy
in
either
event
there
could
be
no
question
of
independence
it
was
a
choice
between
the
hegemony
of
egypt
or
that
of
assyria
from
the
moment
that
had
made
his
appearance
on
the
northern
horizon
the
nations
of
southern
syria
had
instinctively
looked
to
pharaoh
for
aid
there
seems
to
have
been
an
egyptian
faction
in
samaria
even
during
the
disorders
which
broke
out
after
the
death
of
jeroboam
and
perhaps
it
was
a
hope
of
overcoming
it
easily
which
led
menahem
of
his
own
accord
to
invoke
the
still
remote
suzerainty
of
nineveh
after
the
fall
of
unki
in
later
on
when
pekah
had
assassinated
pekahiah
and
entered
into
alliance
with
eezin
he
adopted
the
view
of
those
who
saw
no
hope
of
safety
save
from
the
banks
of
the
nile
his
only
reason
for
doing
so
being
apparently
because
the
kings
of
the
fallen
dynasty
had
received
support
from
the
valley
of
the
tigris
hosea
continually
reproached
his
countrymen
with
this
vacillating
policy
and
pointed
out
the
folly
of
it
is
like
a
silly
dove
without
understanding
they
call
unto
egypt
they
go
unto
assyria
when
they
shall
go
i
will
spread
my
net
upon
them
said
the
eternal
the
existence
of
an
egyptian
faction
at
this
period
has
been
admitted
by
kittel
winckler
has
traced
to
the
arabian
or
idumæan
muzri
everything
previously
referred
to
egypt
his
arguments
seem
to
me
to
be
in
many
cases
convincing
as
i
shall
point
out
where
necessary
but
i
think
he
carries
his
theory
too
far
when
he
systematically
excludes
egypt
and
puts
muzri
in
its
place
egypt
even
in
its
decadent
state
was
a
far
more
important
power
than
the
arabian
muzri
and
it
seems
unreasonable
to
credit
it
with
such
a
limited
share
in
the
politics
of
the
time
i
can
not
believe
that
any
other
power
is
intended
in
most
of
those
passages
in
the
hebrew
writings
and
assyrian
inscriptions
in
which
the
words
mizraîm
and
muzri
occur
hos

they
were
to
be
given
up
to
assyria
and
dispersed
and
while
some
were
to
go
into
assur
and
eat
unclean
food
ephraim
was
to
return
into
egypt
lo
they
are
gone
away
from
destruction
yet
egypt
shall
gather
them
up
memphis
shall
bury
nevertheless
they
persisted
in
negotiating
with
egypt
and
though
there
was
as
yet
no
formal
alliance
between
samaria
and
sais
or
tanis
their
relations
were
so
close
that
no
enemy
of
israel
could
look
for
protection
from
psamuti
or
his
vassals
ahaz
had
therefore
nothing
to
hope
from
this
quarter
and
was
compelled
by
the
force
of
circumstances
to
throw
himself
into
the
arms
of
assyria
if
he
decided
to
call
in
outside
aid
at
all
his
prophets
like
those
of
pekah
strenuously
forbade
him
to
do
so
and
among
them
was
one
who
was
beginning
to
exert
a
marvellous
influence
over
all
classes
of
society
isaiah
the
son
of
amoz
he
had
begun
his
career
in
the
year
that
uzziah
died
and
had
continued
to
prophesy
without
interruption
during
the
brief
reign
of
jotham
hos
ix
isa
vi
the
fragments
which
can
be
assigned
to
this
period
now
occur
as
follows
chap
ii
verses
are
also
found
in
iv
and
were
perhaps
borrowed
from
some
third
prophet
ii
the
parable
of
the
vineyard
and
lastly
chap
in
so
far
as
the
substance
is
concerned
it
seems
to
have
been
put
into
its
present
form
long
after
the
events
when
jahveh
first
appeared
to
him
in
the
smoke
of
the
altar
seated
on
a
throne
and
surrounded
by
seraphim
a
sense
of
his
own
unworthiness
filled
him
with
fear
but
an
angel
purified
his
lips
with
a
live
coal
and
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
lord
saying
shall
i
send
and
who
will
go
for
us
and
he
replied
am
i
send
me
whereupon
jahveh
gave
him
this
message
ye
indeed
but
understand
not
and
see
ye
indeed
but
perceive
not
make
the
heart
of
this
people
fat
and
make
their
ears
heavy
and
shut
their
eyes
lest
they
see
with
their
eyes
and
hear
with
their
ears
and
understand
with
their
heart
and
turn
again
and
be
then
the
prophet
asked
how
long
and
jahveh
answered
cities
be
waste
without
inhabitant
and
houses
without
man
and
the
land
become
utterly
waste
and
jahveh
have
removed
men
far
away
and
the
forsaken
places
be
many
in
the
midst
of
the
land
and
if
there
be
yet
a
tenth
in
it
it
shall
be
eaten
up
as
a
terebinth
and
as
an
oak
whose
stock
remaineth
when
they
are
felled
so
the
holy
seed
is
the
stock

explanatory
gloss

and

and
of
the
son
of

which
formed
no
part
of
the
original
prophecy

here
inserted
in
the
text
judah
though
less
powerful
was
quite
as
corrupt
as
his
brethren
of
israel
and
the
divine
wrath
threatened
him
no
less
than
them
it
rested
with
himself
however
to
appease
it
by
repentance
and
to
enter
again
into
divine
favour
after
suffering
his
punishment
the
eternal
would
then
gather
together
on
mount
sion
those
of
his
faithful
people
who
had
survived
the
crisis
and
would
assure
them
a
long
period
of
prosperity
under
his
law
the
prophet
convinced
that
men
could
in
no
wise
alter
the
decrees
of
the
highest
save
by
repentance
alone
was
astonished
that
the
heads
of
the
state
should
strive
to
impede
the
progress
of
events
that
were
happening
under
their
very
eyes
by
the
elaborately
useless
combinations
of
their
worldly
diplomacy
to
his
mind
the
invasion
of
pekah
and
eezin
was
a
direct
manifestation
of
the
divine
anger
and
it
filled
him
with
indignation
that
the
king
should
hope
to
escape
from
it
by
begging
for
an
alliance
against
them
with
one
of
the
great
powers
when
jahveh
should
decide
that
the
punishment
was
sufficient
for
the
crime
he
would
know
how
to
shatter
his
instruments
without
any
earthly
help
indeed
isaiah
had
already
told
his
master
some
days
before
the
allied
kings
appeared

was

thereby

the
matter
would
not

to

moment

his

were

serious
danger
nabonazîr

never

from
the
fidelity
which
he
had
sworn
to
his
mighty
ally
after
the
events

the
tranquillity
of
his
reign
had
been
more
than
once
disturbed
by
revolt

itself
had
risen
on
one
occasion
and
endeavoured
to
establish
itself
as
an
independent
city
side
by
side
with
babylon
when
nabonazîr
died

was
succeeded
by
his
son
nabunâdinzîri

at

end
of

couple
of
years

was
assassinated
during

outbreak

of

had

usurped
the
crown

wore
it
for
two
months
and
twelve
days
and
then
abdicated
in
favour
of
a
certain
ukînzîr
the
following
is
as
complete
a
list
as
can
at

be
compiled
of
this
babylonian
dynasty
the
eighth
of
those
registered
in
canons
cf

altorient
illustration
table
of
this
babylonian
dynasty
it
included
kings
and
lasted
for
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
years
the
latter
was
chief
of
the
one
of
the
most
important
among
the
chaldæan
communities
the
descendants
of
the
aramaean
nomads
were
thus
once
more
placed
upon
the
throne
and
their
accession
put
an
end
to
the
relations
which
had
existed
for
several
centuries
between
assyria
and
karduniash
the
chronicle
is
silent
with
regard
to
the
origin
of
ukînzîr
but
who
declines
to
give
him
the
title
of
of
babylon
says
that
he
was
son
of
amukkâni
indicates
that
ukînzîr
belonged
to
a
dynasty
the
name
of
which
may
be
read
either
shashi
or
shapi
the
reading
shapi
at
once
recalls
the
name
of
shapîa
one
of
the
chief
cities
of
the
bît
amukkâni
it
would
thus
confirm
the
evidence
of
the
nimroud
inscription
these
marauders
who
had
always
shown
themselves
impatient
of
any
settled
authority
and
had
never
proffered
more
than
a
doubtful
submission
to
even
the
most
triumphant
invader
were
not
likely
to
accept
the
subordinate
position
which
members
of
the
presiding
dynasty
had
been
for
the
most
part
content
to
occupy
it
was
more
probable
that
they
would
from
the
very
first
endeavour
to
throw
off
the
suzerainty
of
nineveh
gave
the
new
dynasty
no
time
to
settle
itself
firmly
on
the
throne
the
year
after
his
return
from
syria
he
got
together
an
army
and
marched
against
it
he
first
cleared
the
right
bank
of
the
tigris
where
the
pukudu
pekod
offered
but
a
feeble
resistance
he
annexed
their
territory
to
the
ancient
province
of

crossed
the

still
however
maintained
the
siege
but
when
winter
came
on
and
the
place
still
held
out
he
broke
up
his
camp

retreated
in
good
order

the
districts
which
he
had
laid
waste

by
an
assyrian
force

campaign

had
acquired
nearly
of
the
whole
babylonian

still
refused
to

it

no
easy
task
to
compel
it
to

master

an
assyrian
king

the
hands

the
condition
attached
to
this
solemn
investiture
which
obliged
him
to
divide
his
time
between
calah
and

and
to
repeat
at
every
festival
of
the
new
year
the
mystic
ceremony
by
which
the
god
of
the
city
confirmed
him
in

once
more

his
babylonian
subjects
seem
to
have
taken
a
liking
to
him
and
perhaps
in
order
to
hide
from
themselves
their
dependent
condition
they
shortened
his
purely
assyrian
name
of
into
the
familiar
sobriquet
of
puru
or
pulu
under
which
appellation
the
native
chroniclers
later
on
inscribed
him
in
the
official
list
of
kings

did
not
long
survive
his
triumph
but
died
in
the
month
of
tebeth
after
having
reigned
eighteen
years
over
assyria
and
less
than
two
years
over
babylon
and
chaldæa
the
formulae
employed
by
the
scribes
in
recording
historical
events
vary
so
little
from
one
reign
to
another
that
it
is
in
most
cases
a
difficult
matter
to
make
out
under
the
mask
of
uniformity
by
which
they
are
all
concealed
the
true
character
and
disposition
of
each
successive
sovereign
one
thing
however
is
certain
the
monarch
who
now
came
upon
the
scene
after
half
a
century
of
reverses
and
in
a
brief
space
restored
to
his
armies
the
skill
necessary
to
defeat
such
formidable
foes
as
the
armenians
or
the
syrians
of
damascus
must
have
been
an
able
general
and
a
born
leader
of
men
yet
nineveh
had
never
suffered
long
from
a
lack
of
capable
generals
and
there
would
be
little
to
distinguish
from
any
of
his
predecessors
if
we
could
place
nothing
more
than
a
few
successful
campaigns
to
his
credit
his
claim
to
a
place
among
them
rests

he
combined
the
talents
of
the
soldier
with
the
higher
qualities
of
the
administrator
and
organised
his
kingdom
in
a
manner
at
once
so
simple
and
so
effective
that
most
of
the
oriental
powers
down
to
the
time
of
the
grecian
conquest
were
content
to
accept
it
as
a
model
as
soon
as
the
ambition
of
the
assyrian
kings
began
to
extend
beyond
the
region
confined
between
the
khabur
and
the
greater
zab
they
found
it
necessary
to
parcel
out
their
territory
into
provinces
under
the
authority
of
prefects
for
the
purpose
of
preserving
order
among
the
vanquished
peoples
and
at
the
same
time
of
protecting
them
from
the
attacks
of
adjacent
tribes
these
representatives
of
the
central
power
were
supported
by
garrisons
and
were
thus
enabled
to
put
down
such
minor
insurrections
as
broke
out
from
time
to
time
some
of
these
provinces
were
already
in
existence
in
the
reigns
of

fact
that

in
northern
phoenicia
and
in
in
galilee
at

in
his
case
however
certain
elements
came
into
play
which
forced
him
to
modify
several
of
their
methods
and
to
have
recourse
to
others
which
they
had
seldom
or
never
employed
the
majority
of
the
countries
hitherto
incorporated
had
been
near
enough
to
the
capital
whether
it
were
assur
calah
or
nineveh
to
permit
of
strict
watch
being
kept
for
any
sign
of
disaffection
and
they
could
be
promptly
recalled
to
order
if
they
attempted
to
throw
off
the
yoke
these
provinces
were
moreover
of
moderate
area
and
sparsely
populated
once
drawn
within
the
orbit
of
attraction
they
were
unable
to
escape
from
its
influence
by
their
own
unaided
efforts
on
the
contrary
they
gradually
lost
their
individuality
and
ended
by
becoming
merged
in
the
body
of
the
nation

aramaean
tribes
of
the

of
the

the

of

the
slopes
of

became
assimilated
to
their
conquerors
after
a
more
or
less
protracted
resistance
till
at
length
in
spite
of
differences
of
origin
creed
and
speech
they
became
the
best
of
assyrians
every
whit
as
devoted
to
the
person
of
their
king
and
as
jealous
of
his
honour
as
the
aboriginal
assyrians
themselves
a
similar
result
could
not
be
looked
for
in
the
case
of
the
cities
recently
subdued
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
babylon
and
damascus
to
name
but
two
of
the
most
important
would
allow
themselves
to
be
influenced
and
to
become
reconciled
to
their
lot
by
artifices
which
had
been
successful
enough
with
the
medes
and
in
the
country
of
to
take
the
case
of
babylon
first
it
was
no
mere
conglomeration
of
tribes
nor
a
state
of
minor
importance
but
an
actual
empire
nearly
as
large
as
that
of
assyria
itself
and
almost
as
solidly
welded
together
it
extended
from
the
turnat
and
the
mountains
of
blam
to
the
arabian
desert
and
the
and
even
though
the
cossæans
elamites
kaldâ
sumerians
akkadians
and
other
remnants
of
ancient
peoples
who
formed
its
somewhat
motley
population
had
dwelt
there
for
centuries
in
a
state
of
chronic
discord
they
all
agreed
in
theory
at
any
rate
in
recognising
the
common
suzerainty
of
babylon
babylon
was
moreover
by
general
acknowledgment
the
ancient
metropolis
to
which
assyria
owed
its
whole
civilisation
it
was
the
holy
city
whose
gods
and
whose
laws
had
served
as
a
prototype
for
the
gods
and
laws
of
assyria
from
its
temples
and
its
archives
the
assyrian
scribes
had
drawn
such
knowledge
as
they
had
of
the
history
of
the
ancient
world
their
religious
doctrines
and
ceremonies
their
methods
of
interpreting
the
omens
and
of
forecasting
the
future
in
short
their
whole
literature
both
sacred
and
profane
the
king
of
nineveh
might
conquer
babylon
might
even
enter
within
its
gates
in
the
hour
of
triumph
and
when
once
he
had
it
at
his
mercy
might
throw
down
its
walls
demolish
its
palaces
destroy
its
burn
its
houses
exterminate
or
carry
off
its
inhabitants
and
blot
out
its
name
from
the
list
of
nations
but
so
long
as
he
recoiled
from
the
sacrilege
involved
in
such
irreparable
destruction
he
was
not
merely
powerless
to
reduce
it
to
the
level
of
an
ordinary
leading
provincial
town
such
as
tela
or
tushkhân
but
he
could
not
even
deprive
it
in
any
way
of
its
rank
as
a
capital
or
hope
to
make
it
anything
less
than
the
second
city
of
his
empire
as
long
as
it
remained
in
existence
it
necessarily
took
precedence
of
all
others
thanks
to
its
extensive
area
the
beauty
and
antiquity
of
its
buildings
and
the
number
of
its
inhabitants
the
pride
of
its
nobles
and
priests
subdued
for
a
moment
by
defeat
would
almost
instantly
have
reasserted
itself
had
the
victor
sought
to
lower
the
dignity
of
their
city
babylon
only
consented
to
accept
an
alien
master
provided
he
bowed
himself
respectfully
before
its
superiority
and
was
willing
to
forget
that
he
was
a
stranger
within
its
gates
and
was
ready
to
comply
with
its
laws
and
masquerade
as
a
babylonian
iii
never
dreamt
therefore
of
treating
the
babylonians
as
slaves
or
of
subordinating
them
to
their
assyrian
descendants
but
left
their
liberties
and
territory
alike
unimpaired
he
did
not
attempt
to
fuse
into
a
single
empire
the
two
kingdoms
which
his
ability
had
won
for
him
he
kept
them
separate
and
was
content
to
be
monarch
of
both
on
similar
terms
he
divided
himself
as
it
were
into
two
persons
one
of
whom
reigned
in
calah
while
the
other
reigned
in
karduniash
and
his
chaldæan
subjects
took
care
to
invest
this
dual
based
on
a
fiction
so
soothing
to
their
pride
with
every
appearance
of
reality
he
received
from
them
together
with
all
the
titles
of
the
babylonian
kings
that
name
of
pulu
which
later
on
found
its
way
into
their
chronicles
and
which
was
so
long
a
puzzle
to
historians
both
ancient
and
modern
experience
amply
proved
that
this
was
the
only
means
by
which
it
was
possible
to
yoke
temporarily
together
the
two
great
powers
of
the
euphrates
and
the
tigris
among
the
successors
of
the
only
sovereigns
to
rule
over
babylon
without
considerable
difficulty
were
those
who
followed
the
precedent
set
by
him
and
were
satisfied
to
divide
their
functions
and
reign
as
dual
kings
over
a
dual
kingdom
this
was
so
in
the
case
of
immediate
successor
shalmaneser
of
esarhaddon
and
of
shalmaneser
was
known
at
babylon
by
the
name
of
ululai
by
that
of
this
combination
while
gratifying
to
the
ambition
of
its
rulers
was
perhaps
more
a
source
of
loss
than
of
gain
to
assyria
itself
it
is
true
that
the
power
of
karduniash
had
decreased
under
the
previous
dynasty
but
it
had
still
been
strong
enough
to
hold
back
the
aramæans
of
the
persian
gulf
on
one
side
and
the
elamite
hordes
on
the
other
it
lay
like
a
broad
barrier
between
these
barbarians
and
the
cities
of
the
middle
tigris
when
an
unusually
vigorous
attack
compelled
it
to
give
way
at
some
point
it
appealed
to
nineveh
for
help
and
an
assyrian
army
entering
the
country
at
the
fords
of
the
zab
hastened
to
drive
back
the
aggressors
to
the
place
from
which
they
had
set
out
when
however
the
kings
of
assyria
had
become
kings
of
babylon
as
well
the
situation
was
altered
several
branches
of
the
kaldâ
had
hitherto
held
possession
of
the
city
and
still
possessed
representatives
and
allies
among
the
other
tribes
especially
among
the
who
believed
themselves
entitled
to
reassert
their
supremacy
within
in
the
elamite
princes
on
their
part
accustomed
to
descend
at
will
into
the
plains
that
lay
between
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates
and
to
enrich
themselves
by
frequent
raids
could
not
make
up
their
minds
to
change
the
habits
of
centuries
until
they
had
at
least
crossed
swords
with
the
new
despot
and
put
his
mettle
to
the
test
the
ninevite
king
of
babylon
was
thus
in
duty
bound
to
protect
his
subjects
against
the
same
enemies
that
had
ceaselessly
harassed
his
predecessors
and
as
the
unaided
resources
of
karduniash
no
longer
enabled
him
to
do
so
effectively
he
was
naturally
obliged
to
fall
back
on
the
forces
at
his
disposal
as
king
of
assyria
henceforward
it
was
no
longer
the
babylonian
army
that
protected
nineveh
but
rather
that
of
nineveh
which
had
to
protect
babylon
and
to
encounter
almost
every
year
foes
whom
in
former
days
it
had
met
only
at
rare
intervals
and
then
merely
when
it
chose
to
intervene
in
their
affairs
where
the
assyrian
sovereigns
had
gained
a
kingdom
for
themselves
and
their
posterity
assyria
itself
found
little
else
but
fresh
and
formidable
adversaries
in
the
effort
to
overcome
whom
its
energies
were
all
but
exhausted
in
syria
and
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
had
nations
of
less
stubborn
vitality
to
deal
with
nor
was
he
bound
by
the
traditions
of
a
common
past
to
show
equal
respect
to
their
prejudices
arpad
unki
the
bekâa
damascus
and
gilead
were
all
consecutively
swallowed
up
by
assyria
but
the
work
of
absorption
once
completed
difficulties
were
encountered
which
now
had
to
be
met
for
the
first
time
the
subordinate
to
whom
he
entrusted
the
task
of
governing
these
had
one
or
two
assyrian
regiments
assigned
him
as
his
and
these
exercised
the
same
ascendency
over
the
natives
as
the
egyptian
archers
had
done
in
days
gone
by
it
was
felt
that
they
had
the
whole
might
of
assyria
behind
them
and
the
mere
fact
of
their
presence
in
the
midst
of
the
conquered
country
was
as
a
rule
sufficient
to
guarantee
the
safety
of
the
assyrian
governor
and
ensure
obedience
to
his
commands
the
governor
was
called
whom
the
king
has
established
in
his
place
and
pilot
manager
whence
district
and
master
of
a
it
seems
that
the
was
of
higher
rank
than
the
and
often
had
the
latter
under
his
command
thus
selected
the
horsemen
and
other
soldiers
who
were
to
form
the
of
the
governor
of
parzindu
this
was
never
a
very
numerous
one
for
the
army
would
have
melted
away
in
the
course
of
a
campaign
or
two
had
it
been
necessary
after
each
fresh
conquest
to
detach
from
it
a
sufficient
force
to
guard
against
rebellion
it
was
strengthened
it
is
true
by
auxiliaries
enlisted
on
the
spot
and
the
tributary
chiefs
included
in
the
provincial
district
were
expected
to
furnish
a
reasonable
quota
of
men
in
case
of
need
but
the
loyalty
of
all
these
people
was
at
the
best
somewhat
doubtful
and
in
the
event
of
their
proving
untrustworthy
at
a
critical
moment
the
little
band
of
assyrian
horse
and
foot
would
be
left
to
deal
with
the
revolt
unaided
until
such
time
as
the
king
could
come
and
relieve
them
in
a
despatch
from
belibni
to
we
find
aramæans
from
the
persian
gulf
submitting
to
the
authority
of
an
assyrian
officer
and
fighting
in
elam
side
by
side
with
his
troops
again
under
an
army
sent
to
repress
a
revolt
on
the
part
of
kedar
and
the
nabatseans
included
contingents
from
ammon
moab
and
edom
together
with
the
assyrian
garrisons
of
the
haurân
and
zobah
the
distance
between
the
banks
of
the
jordan
or
abana
and
those
of
the
tigris
was
a
long
one
and
in
nearly
every
instance
it
would
have
been
a
question
of
months
before
help
could
arrive
meanwhile
egypt
was
at
hand
jealous
of
her
rival
who
was
thus
encroaching
on
territory
which
had
till
lately
been
regarded
as
her
exclusive
sphere
of
influence
and
vaguely
apprehensive
of
the
fate
which
might
be
in
store
for
her
if
some
assyrian
army
spurred
by
the
lust
of
conquest
were
to
cross
the
desert
and
bear
down
upon
the
eastern
frontiers
of
the
delta
distrustful
of
her
own
powers
and
unwilling
to
assume
a
directly
offensive
attitude
she
did
all
she
could
to
foment
continual
disturbances
among
the
hebrews
and
phoenicians
as
well
as
in
philistia
and
aram
she
carried
on
secret
intrigues
with
the
independent
princes
and
held
out
tempting
hopes
of
speedy
intervention
before
the
eyes
of
their
peoples
her
influence
could
readily
be
traced
in
every
seditious
movement
the
handful
of
men
assigned
to
the
governors
of
the
earlier
provinces
close
to
the
capital
would
have
been
of
little
avail
against
perils
of
this
kind
though
added
colony
to
colony
in
the
distant
regions
annexed
by
him
he
organised
them
on
a
different
plan
from
that
which
had
prevailed
before
his
time
his
predecessors
had
usually
sent
assyrians
to
these
colonies
and
filled
the
villages
vacated
by
them
with
families
taken
from
the
conquered
region
a
transfer
of
inhabitants
was
made
for
instance
from
naîri
or
from
media
into
assyria
and
by

therefore
left
his
assyrians
for
the
most
part

only

distribute
them

he

even
in
the

of
the
most
turbulent
provinces
settlements
of
colonists
who
lived
unaffected
by
any
native
influence
or
resentment
the
aborigines
hated
them
because
of
their
religion
their
customs
their
clothing
and
their
language
in
their
eyes
they
were
mere
interlopers
who
occupied
the

who
had
fallen
in

or
had
been
spirited
away
to
the

end
of

world
and
even
when
after
many
years
the
native
owners
of
the
soil
had
become
familiarised
with
them
this
mutual
antipathy
had
struck
such
deep
root
in
their
minds
that
any
understanding
between
the
natives
and
the
descendants
of
the
immigrants
was
quite
out
of
the
question
what
had
been
formerly
a
vast
kingdom
occupied
by
a
single
homogeneous
race
actuated
by
a
common
patriotic
spirit
became
for
many
a
year
a
region
capriciously
subdivided
and
torn
by
the
dissensions
of
a
number
of
paltry
antagonistic
communities
the
colonists
exposed
to
the
same
hatreds
as
the
original
assyrian
conquerors
soon
forgot
to
look
upon
the
latter
as
the
oppressors
of
all
and
allowing
their
present
grudge
to
efface
the
memory
of
past
injuries
did
not
hesitate
to
make
common
cause
with
them
in
time
of
peace
the
governor
did
his
best
to
protect
them
against
molestation
on
the
part
of
the
natives
and
in
return
for
this
they
rallied
round
him
whenever
the
latter
threatened
to
get
out
of
hand
and
helped
him
to
stifle
the
revolt
or
hold
it
in
check
until
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
thanks
to
their
help
the

was
consolidated
and
maintained
without
too
many
violent
outbreaks
in
regions
far
removed
from
the
capital
and
beyond
the
immediate
reach
of
the
sovereign
we
possess
very
few
details
with
regard
to
the
administration
of
these
prefects
this
was
the
history
of
the
only
one
of
those
colonies
whose
fate
is
known
to
us
that
founded
at
samaria
by
sargon
and
his
successors
the
texts
contain
a
certain
number
of
names
of
offices

precise
nature
of
which
it
is
not
easy
to
ascertain
the
khâzanu
the
labuttu
and
others
one
of
them
apparently
should
be
read
and
identical
with
one
of
the
titles
mentioned
in
ezra

as
being
in
existence
during
the
persian
epoch
the
various
functionaries
governors
of
towns
heads
of
stations
and
officers
whose
duty
it
was
to
patrol
the
roads
and
look
after
the
safety
of
merchants
were
for
the
most
part
selected
from
among
natives
who
had
thrown
in
their
lot
with
assyria
and
probably
few
assyrians
were
to
be
found
outside
the
more
turbulent
cities
and
important
fortresses
the
kings
and
chiefs
whose
territory
was
attached
to
a
given
province
either
took
their
instructions
direct
from
nineveh
or
were
sometimes
placed
under
the
control
of
a
resident
or
with
some
sort
of
escort
at
his
back
who
kept
watch
over
their
movements
and
reported
them
to
the
suzerain
and
saw
that
the
tribute
was
paid
regularly
and
that
the
military
service
provided
for
in
the
treaties
was
duly
rendered
governors
and
residents
alike
kept
up
a
constant
correspondence
with
the
court
and
such
of
their
letters
as
have
chanced
to
come
down
to
us
show
what
a
minute
account
of
even
the
most
trifling
occurrences
was
required
of
them
by
the
central
authorities
they
were
not
only
obliged
to
report
any
fluctuation
in
the
temper
or
attitude
of
their
subordinates
or
any
intrigues
that
were
being
entered
into
across
the
frontier
they
had
also
to
record
the
transfer
of
troops
the
return
of
fugitives
the
pursuit
of
deserters
any
chance
scuffle
between
soldiers
and
natives
as
well
as
the
punishment
inflicted
on
the
rebellious
the
appearance
of
a
portent
in
the
heavens
or
omens
noticed
by
the
augurs
there
were
plenty
of
envious
or
officious
tongues
among
their
followers
to
report
to
headquarters
the
slightest
failure
of
duty
and
to
draw
attention
to
their
negligence
moreover
it
seems
certain
that
the
object
of
thus
compelling
them
to
refer
to
the
king
at
every
turn
was
not
merely
in
order
to
keep
him
informed
of
all
that
took
place
in
his
dependencies
but
also
to
lay
bare
the
daily
life
of
his
prefects
before
his
eyes
the
latter
were
entrusted
with
the
command
of
seasoned
troops
they
had
considerable
sums
of
money
passing
through
their
hands
and
were
often
obliged
to
take
prompt
decisions
and
enter
into
diplomatic
or
military
transactions
on
their
own
responsibility
in
short
most
of
them
at
any
rate
who
were
stationed
at
the
furthest
confines
of
the
empire
were
really
kings
in
all
but
title
insignia
and
birth
there
was
always
the
danger
lest
some
among
them
should
be
tempted
to
reassert
in
their
own
interest
the
independence
of
the
countries
under
their
rule
and
seek
to
found
a
dynasty
in
their
midst
the
strict
supervision
maintained
over
these
governors
generally
nipped
any
ambition
of
this
kind
in
the
bud
in
some
cases
however
it
created
the
very
danger
it
was
intended
to
prevent
if
a
governor
who
had
been
recalled
to
nineveh
or
calah
in
order
to
explain
his
conduct
failed
to
clear
himself
completely
he
at
once
fell
into
disgrace
and
disgrace
in
assyria
as
in
other
countries
of
the
east
meant
nine
times
out
of
ten
confiscation
of
property
mutilation
and
lifelong
imprisonment
or
death
in
its
most
hideous
form
he
would
therefore
think
twice
before
quitting
his
post
and
if
he
had
any
reason
to
suppose
himself
suspected
or
viewed
with
disfavour
in
high
quarters
he
would
be
in
no
hurry
to
obey
a
summons
to
the
capital
a
revolt
was
almost
certain
to
be
crushed
without
fail
and
offered
merely
a
very
precarious
chance
of
escape
but
the
governor
was
seldom
likely
to
hesitate
between
almost
certain
condemnation
and
the
vague
possibility
of
a
successful
rising
in
such
a
case
therefore
he
staked
everything
on
a
single
throw
illustration

besieging

by

the
system
was
a
defective
on
in
that
it
exposed
to
strong
temptation
the
very
functionaries
whose
loyalty
was
most
essential
to
the
proper
working
of
the
administration
but
its
dangers
were
out
weighed
by
such
important
advantages
that
we
can
not
but
regard
it
as
a
very
real
improvement
on
the
haphazard
methods
of
the
past
in
the
first
place
it
opened
up
a
larger
for
the
army
and
in
a
measure
guaranteed
it
against
that
premature
exhaustion
which
had
already
led
more
than
once
to
an
eclipse
of
the
assyrian
power
it
may
be
that
the
pick
of
these
provincial
troops
were
preferably
told
off
for
police
duties
or
for
the
defence
of
the
districts
in
which
they
were
levied
and
that
they
seldom
left
it
except
to
do
battle
in
the
adjacent
territory
but
even
with
these
limitations
they
were
none
the
less
of
inestimable
value
since
they
relieved
the
main
army
of
assyria
from
garrison
duties
in
a
hundred
scattered
localities
and
allowed
the
king
to
concentrate
it
almost
in
its
entirety
about
his
own
person
and
to
direct
it
upon
those
points
where
he
wished
to
strike
a
decisive
blow

the
finances
of
the
kingdom
were
put
on
a
more
stable
and
systematic
basis
for
nearly
the
whole
of
the
two
previous
centuries
during
which
assyria
had
resumed
its
victorious
career
the
treasury
had
been
filled
to
some
extent
by
taxes
in
kind
or
in
money
and
by
various
dues
claimed
from
the
hereditary
kingdom
and
its
few
immediate
dependencies
but
mainly
by
booty
and
by
tribute
levied
after
each
campaign
from
the
peoples
who
had
been
conquered
or
had
voluntarily
submitted
to
assyrian
rule
the
result
was
a
budget
which
fluctuated
greatly
since
all
forays
were
not
equally
lucrative
and
the
new
dependencies
proved
so
refractory
at
the
idea
of
perpetual
tribute
that
frequent
expeditions
were
necessary
in
order
to
persuade
them
to
pay
their
dues
we
do
not
know
how
iii
organised
the
finances
of
his
provinces
but
certain
facts
recorded
here
and
there
in
the
texts
show
that
he
must
have
drawn
very
considerable
amounts
from
them
we
notice
that
twenty
or
thirty
years
after
his
time
carchemish
was
assessed
at
a
hundred

the

stirred
by
the

in
the

unexampled

and

devised
a

him
that
of
ululai

though
seeking
to
persuade
themselves
that
they
had
a
king
who
belonged
to
them
alone

it
is
under
this
name
that
their
annalists
have
inscribed
him

such

among

were
of
too
trifling
a
nature
to
be
deemed
worthy
of
notice
in
the
records
of
the
time
syria
alone
was
disturbed
and
several
of
its
independent
states
took
advantage
of
the
change
of
rulers
to
endeavour
to
shake
off
the
authority
of
assyria
it
was
for
a
long
time
an
open
question
with
the
earlier
assyriologists
whether
or
not
shalmaneser
and
sargon
were
different
names
for
one
and
the
same
monarch

for
monuments

possess
only
one

to
shalmaneser

weight
in

by

at

length
of

we
possess
concerning
it
have
been
learnt
from
the
and
babylonian
and
also
from
the
hebrew
texts

the
identity
of
ululai
and
shalmaneser
though
still
questioned
by
oppert
has
been
proved
by
the
comparison
of
babylonian
records
in
some
of
which
the
names
pulu
and
ululai
occur
in
positions
exactly
corresponding
with
those
occupied
in
others
by
and
shalmaneser
the
name
ululai
was
given
to
the
king
because
he
was
born
in
the
month
of
ulul
in
list
we
find
a
gloss
of
tinu
which
probably
indicates
the
assyrian
town
in
which

and
his
son
were
born
egypt
continued
to
give
them
secret
encouragement
in
these
tactics

its
own
internal
dissensions
prevented
it
from
offering
any
effective
aid

the

is
possible
that
one

the

it
was

because

counted
on

to
restore

they
must

we

it

from
repudiating

the

it
was
to

that
the
syrian

looked
for

death
removed

who
had
trampled
them
so
ruthlessly
underfoot
ever
since

may
be

this
period

originally
confounded
with
samaria
by
the
early
commentators
on
the
babylonian
chronicle
halévy
very
happily
referred
it
to
the
biblical
sepharvaîm

place
always
mentioned
in

and
to
the
sibraim
of

called
in
the
samarêim
its
identification
with
samaria
has
since
then
been
generally
rejected
and
its
connection
with
sibraim
admitted
sibraim
or
sepharvaîm
or
samarêîm
has
been
located
at
shomerîyeh
to
the
east
of
the
and
south
of
hamath
this
achievement
proved
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
that
in
spite
of
their
change
of
rulers
the
vengeance
of
the
assyrians
was
as
keen
and
sharp
as
ever
not
one
of
the
syrian
towns
dared
to
stir
and
the
phonician
seaports
though
their
loyalty
had
seemed
for
a
moment
doubtful
took
care
to
avoid
any
action
which
might
expose
them
to
the
terrors
of
a
like
severity
the
israelites
and
philistines
alone
of
the
western
peoples
could
not
resign
themselves
to
a
prudent
policy
after
a
short
period
of
hesitation
they
drew
the
sword
from
its
scabbard
and
in
war
broke
out
the
siege
of
tyre
which
the
historian
menander
in
a
passage
quoted
by
josephus
places
in
the
reign
of
shalmaneser
ought
really
to
be
referred
to
the
reign
of
sennacherib
or
the
fragment
of
menander
must
be
divided
into
three
parts
dealing
with
three
different
assyrian
campaigns
against

under
sennacherib

esarhaddon
respectively

refers
to

the
passages
in
the
of

xvii
and

which
deal
with
the
close
of
the

of

have
been
interpreted
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
us
two
campaigns
by
shalmaneser
against
hoshea
hoshea
having
failed
to
pay
the
tribute
imposed
upon
him

have

have

the
hebrew

has
ascribed
to
shalmaneser
the
subjection
of
hoshea

was
really
the
act
of
as
well
as
the
final
war
against

to
winckler
the
two
portions
of
the
narrative
must
have
been
borrowed
from
two
different
versions
of

the

inserted

after
the
other
heedless
of

in
them

restore
to
them
their
lost
prosperity
amid
the

their

egypt

and
it
was
therefore
to
egypt
that
they

with

of

better
qualified

the

spread

him

at

of

of

to
the
fading
flower
of

glorious
beauty

as

the
crown
of
the
pride
of

be
trodden
underfoot
and
the

of

accomplished
jahveh
sabaoth
was
to
be
a
crown
of
glory
to
those
of
his
children
who
remained
faithful
to
him
but
judah
far
from
submitting
itself
to
his
laws
betrayed
him
even
as
israel
had
done
its
prophets
and
priests
were
likewise
distraught
with
drunkenness
they
staggered
under
the
effects
of
their
potations
and
turned
to
scorn
the
true
prophet
sent
to
proclaim
to
them
the
will
of
jehovah
they
stammered
between
their
hiccups
will
he
teach
knowledge
and
whom
will
he
make
to
understand
the
message
them
that
are
weaned

from

a

and
sure
enough
it
was
by
the
mouth
of
a
stammering
people
by
the
lips
of
the
assyrians
that
jahveh
was
to
speak
to
them
in
vain
did
the
prophet
implore
them
is
the
rest
give
ye
rest
to
him
that
is

they
did
not

now
jahveh
turns
their
own
gibes
against
them

there
was
to

no

it
gave
up
all
dependence
on

trusted
solely

isa
xxviii
giesebrecht
has
given
it
as
his
opinion
that
only
verses
of
the
prophecy
were
delivered
at
this
epoch
the
remainder
he
believes
to
have
been
written
during
campaign
against
judah
and
suggests
that
the
prophet
added
on
his
previous
oracle
to
them
thus
diverting
it
from
its
original
application
others
such
as
stade
and
wellhausen
regard
the
opening
verses
as
embodying
a
mere
rhetorical
figure
jerusalem
they
say
appeared
to
the
prophet
as
though
changed
into
samaria
and
it
is
this
transformed
city
which
he
calls
crown
of
pride
of
the
drunkards
of
samaria
was
doomed
this
was
the
general
belief
and
men
went
about
repeating
it
after
isaiah
each
in
his
own
words
every
one
feared
lest
the
disaster
should
spread
to
judah
also
and
that
jahveh
having
once
determined
to
have
done
with
the
northern
kingdom
would
turn
his
wrath
against
that
of
the
south
as
well
micah
the
morashtite
a
prophet
born
among
the
ranks
of
the
middle
class
went
up
and
down
the
land
proclaiming
misery
to
be
the
common
lot
of
the
two
sister
nations
sprung
from
the
loins
of
jacob
as
a
punishment
for
their
common
errors
and
weaknesses

the

shall
be

for
the

is
all
this
and
for
the
sins
of
the

of

what
is
the
transgression
of
jacob
is
it
not
samaria
and
what
are
the
high
places
of
judah
are
they
not
jerusalem
the
doom
pronounced
against
samaria
was
already
being
carried
out
and
soon
the
hapless
city
was
to
be
no
more
than
heap
of
the
field
and
as
the
plantings
of
a
vineyard
and
i
will
pour
down

the

she
gathered
them
and
into
the
hire
of

harlot
shall
they
yet
even
while
mourning
over
samaria
the
prophet
can
not
refrain
from
thinking
of
his
own
people
for
the
terrible
blow
which
had
fallen
on
israel
come
even
unto
judah
it

of
my
people

to
doubtless
the
assyrian
generals
kept
a
watchful
eye
upon
ahaz
during
the
whole
time
of
the
siege
from
to
and
when
once
the
first
heat
of
enthusiasm
had
cooled
the
presence
of
so
formidable
an
army
within
striking
distance
must
have
greatly
helped
the
king
to
restrain
the
tendencies
of
some
of
his
subjects
samaria
still
held
out
when
shalmaneser
died
at
babylon
in
the
month
of
tebeth
whether
he
had
no
son
of
fit
age
to
succeed
him
or
whether
a
revolution
similar
to
that
which
had
helped
to
place
on
the
throne
broke
out
as
soon
as
he
had
drawn
his
last
breath
is
not
quite
clear
at
any
rate
sargon
an
officer
who
had
served
under
him
was
proclaimed
king
on
the
day
of
tebeth
and
his
election
was
approved
by
the
whole
of
assyria
after
some
days
of
hesitation
babylon
declined
to
recognise
him
and
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
a
kaldu
named
or
while
these
events
were
taking
place
in
the
heart
of
the
empire
samaria
succumbed
perhaps
to
famine
but
more
probably
to
force
it
was
sacked
and
dismantled
and
the
bulk
of
its
population
amounting
to
souls
were
carried
away
into
mesopotamia
and
distributed
along
the
balîkh
the
khabur
the
banks
of
the
river
of
gozân
and
among
the
towns
of
the
median
frontier
sargon
does
not
mention
where
he
deported
the
israelites
to
but
we
learn
this
from
the
book
of
xvii
xviii
there
has
been
much
controversy
as
to
whether
samaria
was
taken
by
shalmanoser
as
the
hebrew
chronicler
seems
to
believe
kings
xvii
xviii
or
by
sargon
as
the
assyrian
scribes
assure
us
at
first
several
scholars
suggested
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
by
arguing
that
shalmaneser
and
sargon
were
one
and
the
same
person
afterwards
the
theory
took
shape
that
samaria
was
really
captured
in
the
reign
of
shalmaneser
but
by
sargon
who
was
in
command
of
the
besieging
army
at
the
time
and
who
transferred
this
achievement
of
which
he
was
naturally
proud
to
the
beginning
of
his
own
reign
the
simplest
course
seems
to
be
to
accept
for
the
present
the
testimony
of
contemporary
documents
and
place
the
fall
of
samaria
at
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
sargon
being
the
time
indicated
by
sargon
in
his
inscriptions
sargon
made
the
whole
territory
into
a
province
an
assyrian
governor
was
installed
in
the
palace
of
the
kings
of
israel

soon
the

of
the
strange
gods
smoked

with

the
last
of
the
states
which
had
aspired
with
some
prospect
of
success
to
rule
over
syria
they
had
risen
one
after
another
during
the
four
centuries
in
which
the
absence
of
the
stranger
had
left
them
masters
of
their
own
fate
the
hittites
in
the
north
the
hebrews
and
the
philistines
in
the
south
and
the
aramæans
and
damascus
in
the
centre
each
one
of
these
races
had
enjoyed
its
years
of
glory
and
ambition
in
the
course
of
which
it
had
seemed
to
prevail
over
its
rivals
then
those
whose
territory
lay
at
the
extremities
began
to
feel
the
disadvantages
of
their
isolated
position
and
after
one
or
two
victories
gave
up
all
hope
of
ever
establishing
a
supremacy
over
the
whole
country
the
hittite
sphere
of
influence
never
at
any
time
extended
much
further
southwards
than
the
sources
of
the
orontes
while
that
of
the
hebrews
in
their
palmiest
days
can
not
have
gone
beyond
the
vicinity
of
hamath
and
even
progress
thus
far
had
cost
both
hebrews
and
hittites
a
struggle
so
exhausting
that
they
could
not
long
maintain
it
no
sooner
did
they
relax
their
efforts
than
those
portions
of
which
they
had
annexed
to
their
original
territory
being
too
remote
from
the
seat
of
power
to
feel
its
full
attraction
gradually
detached
themselves
and
resumed
their
independence
their
temporary
suzerains
being
too
much
exhausted
by
the
intensity
of
their
own
exertions
to
retain
hold
over
them
damascus
which
lay
almost
in
the
centre
at
an
equal
distance
from
the
euphrates

it
was
damascus

damascus
alone

lulled
to
blissful
slumbers
in
her
shady
gardens
she
did
not
awake
to
political
life
and
to
the
desire
of
conquest
until
after
all
the
rest
and
at
the
very
moment
when
nineveh
was
beginning
to
recover
from
her
early
reverses
both
had
had
a
free
hand
given
them
during
the
which
followed
and
they
had
taken
advantage
of
this
respite
to
reduce
the
lebanon
arvadian
phoenicia
hamath
and
the
hebrews
in
fact
of
the
whole
country
to
subjection
and
to
organise

league
of
the
twelve
kings
which
reckoned
ahab

israel
among
its
leaders

rudimentary
kingdom
had
scarcely
come
into
existence

its

had
not
yet
properly
combined

veterans

them
it
however
successfully
withstood
the
shock
and
its
stubborn
resistance
at
the
beginning
of
the
struggle
shows
us
what
it
might
have
done
had
its
founders
been
allowed
time
in
which
to
weld
together
the
various
elements
at
their
disposal
as
it
was
it
was
doomed

much
to
the
superiority
of
the
enemy

to
the
insubordination
of
its
vassals
and
its

internal
discords
the

twelve
kings
did
not
survive
ii
hazael
and
his
successors
wore
themselves
out
in
repelling
the
attacks
of
the
assyrians

in
repressing
the
revolts
of
israel
when
iii
arrived
on
the
scene
both
princes
and
people
alike
at
damascus
and
samaria
were
so
spent
that
even
their
final
alliance
could
not
save
them
from
defeat
its
lack
of
geographical
unity
and
political
combination
had
once
more
doomed
syria
to
the
servitude
of
alien

the
assyrians

iii
sargon
of
assyria
as
a
warrior
and
as
a
whether
sargon
was
even
remotely
connected
with
the
royal
line
is
a
question
which
for
the
present
must
remain
unanswered
he
mentions
in
one
of
his
inscriptions
the
three
hundred
princes
who
had
preceded
him
in
the
government
of
assyria
and
three
lines
further
on
he
refers
to
the
kings
his
ancestors
but
he
never
mentions
his
own
father
by
name
and
this
omission
seems
to
prove
that
he
was
not
a
direct
descendant
of
shalmaneser
nor
of
iii
nor
indeed
of
any
of
their
immediate
predecessors
it
is
however
probable
if
not
certain
that
he
could
claim
some
sort
of
kinship
with
them
though
more
or
less
remote
it
was
customary
for
the
sovereigns
of
nineveh
to
give
their
daughters
in
marriage
to
important
officials
or
lords
of
their
court
and
owing
to
the
constant
contraction
of
such
alliances
through
several
centuries
there
was
hardly
a
noble
family
but
had
some
royal
blood
in
its
veins
and
that
of
sargon
was
probably
no
exception
to
the
rule
his
genealogy
was
traced
by
the
chroniclers
through
several
hundred
generations
of
princes
to
the
heroes
who
had
founded
the
city
of
assur
but
as
and
his
descendants
had
claimed
and
sulili
as
the
founders
of
their
race
the
sargonids
chose
a
different
tradition
and
drew
their
descent
from
belbâni
son
of
adasi
the
cause
and
incidents
of
the
revolution
which
raised
sargon
to
the
throne
are
unknown
but
we
may
surmise
that
the
policy
adopted
with
regard
to
karduniash
was
a
factor
in
the
case
had
hardly
entered
babylon
before
the
fascination
of
the
city
the
charm
of
its
associations
and
the
sacred
character
of
the
legends
which
hallowed
it
seized
upon
his
imagination
he
returned
to
it
twice
in
the
space
of
two
years
to
the
hands
of
bel
and
shalmaneser
much
preferred
it
to
calah
or
nineveh
as
a
place
of
residence
the
assyrians
doubtless
soon
became
jealous
of
the
favour
shown
by
their
princes
to
their
ancient
enemy
and
their
discontent
must
have
doubtless
conduced
to
their
decision
to
raise
a
new
monarch
to
the
throne
the
babylonians
on
the
other
hand
seem
to
have
realised
that
the
change
in
the
dynasty
presaged
a
disadvantageous
alteration
of
government
for
as
soon
as
the
news
reached
them
a
movement
was
set
on
foot
and
search
made
for
a
rival
claimant
to
set
up
in
opposition
to
sargon
the
succession
of
events
as
indicated
in
babylonian
seems
indeed
to
imply
that
the
babylonians
waited
to
ascertain
the
disposition
of
the
new
king
before
they
decided
what
line
to
adopt
in
fact
shalmaneser
died
in
the
month
tebeth
and
sargon
ascended
the
throne
at
assur
in
the
same
month
and
it
was
only
in
the
month
nisân
that
was
proclaimed
king
the
three
months
intervening
between
the
accession
of
sargon
and
that
of
evidently
represent
a
period
of
when
it
was
not
yet
known
if
the
king
would
follow
the
policy
of
his
predecessors
with
regard
to
babylon
or
adopt
a
different
attitude
towards
her
of
all
the
nations
who
had
in
turn
occupied
the
plains
of
the
lower
euphrates
and
the
marshes
bordering
on
arabia
the
kaldâ
alone
had
retained
their
full
vitality
they
were
constantly
recruited
by
immigrants
from
their
kinsfolk
of
the
desert
and
the
continual
infiltration
of
these
elements
kept
the
race
from
becoming
enervated
by
contact
with
the
indigenous
population
and
more
than
compensated
for
the
losses
in
their
ranks
occasioned
by
war
the
invasion
of
and
the
consequent
deportations
of
prisoners
had
decimated
the
tribes
of
and
the
principalities
of
the
kaldâ
which
lay
nearest
to
babylonian
territory
and
which
had
borne
the
brunt
of
attack
in
the
preceding
period
but
their
weakness
brought
into
notice
a
power
better
equipped
for
warfare
whose
situation
in
their
rear
had
as
a
rule
hitherto
preserved
it
from
contact
with
the
assyrians
namely
the
continual
deposit
of
alluvial
soil
at
the
mouths
of
the
rivers
had
greatly
altered
the
coastline
from
the
earliest
historic
times
downwards
the
ancient
estuary
was
partly
filled
up

on
the
western
side

the
euphrates

persian
gulf

narrow
barrier
of
sand

between

the
spot
where
the
streams
of
fresh
water
met
the
tidal
waters
of
the
sea

all
that
was
left
of
the
ancient
gulf

a
vast

as
the

on
the
banks

the
southern
and
western
portions
of
this
district

the
mouth
of
the

to
the
edge
of
the
desert
the
aspect
of
the
country
was
constantly
changing
and
presented
no
distinctive
features
it
was
a
region
difficult
to
attack
and
easy
to
defend
it
consisted
first
of
a
spongy
plain
saturated
with
water
with
scattered
artificial
mounds
on
which
stood
the
clustered
huts
of
the
villages
between
this
plain
and
the
shore
stretched
a
labyrinth
of
fens
and
irregularly
divided
by
canals
and
channels
freshly
formed
each
year
in
meres
strewn
with
floating
islets
immense
where
the
neighbouring
peasants
took
refuge
from
attack
and
into
which
no
one
would
venture
to
penetrate
without
hiring
some
friendly
native
as
a
guide
in
this
fenland
dwelt
the
kaldâ
in
their
low
small
conical
huts
of
reeds
somewhat
resembling

ancient
times
the

aspired
to
the

the
suzerainty
over
it

fortune
had
several
times
favoured
their

designs
on

they
had
pressed
forward
their
victorious
arms
as
far
as
the
mediterranean
and
from
that
time
forward
though
the
theatre
of
their
operations
was
more
restricted
they
had
never
renounced
the
right
to
interfere
in
babylonian
affairs
and
indeed
not
long
previously
one
of
them
had
reigned
for
a
period
of
seven
years
in

between

our
information
with
regard
to
the
order
of
succession

the
history
of
these
energetic
and
warlike
monarchs
is
as
yet
very
scanty
their
names
even
are
for
the
most
part
lost
and
only
approximate
dates
can
be

to
those

from

the

of
whom
we
have
any
record
exercised
a
doubtful
authority
from
anshân
to
susa
somewhere
about
the
fourteenth
century
and
built
a
temple
to
the
god
kirisha
in
his
capital
liyan
these
names
are
in
the
majority
of
cases
found
written
on
stamped

baked
bricks
they
were
first
compared
with
the
names
contained
in
the
annals
of
sargon
and
his
successors
and
assimilated
to
those
of
the
princes
who
were
contemporary
with
sennacherib
and
then
they
were
referred
to
the
time
of
the
great
elamite
empire
and
one
of
them
was
identified
with
that

uruk
years
before
finally
they
were
brought
down
again
to
an
intermediate
period
more
precisely
to
the
fourteenth

thirteenth
century
this
last
date
appears
to
be
justified
at

as
the
highest
permissible
by
the
mention
of
durkurigalzu
in
a

the
first
to
recognise
that
liyan
was
a
name

the

that

it
was

he
is
mentioned
on

that
is
all
the

lifted

perhaps
a

the

of

proved
by
the
genealogies
with
which
their

are

jensen
has
shown
that
we
ought
to
read
and
instead
of
the
shorter
forms
khalludush

read

the
inscriptions
on
their

boast
of
their
power
their
piety
and
their
inexhaustible
wealth
one
after
another
they
repaired
and
enlarged
the
temple
built
by
at
liyan
erected
sanctuaries
and
palaces
at

citadel
and

cossæans

as

contested
the

of
the
countries

bank
of

succeeded

conquering

deprived

one

of
his
sceptre

of
whose
hands
had
to
be
taken
by
each
newly
elected
king

had
carried
it
off
in
his
waggons
to
elam
together
with
much
spoil
from
the
cities

euphrates
the
name
of
the
king

destroyed

document

the
mention
of
as
his
son
obliges
us

further
information
comes
to
light
to
recognise
in
him
the
of
the
bricks
of
susa
who
also
had
a
son

would
confirm
the
restoration
of
as
the
name
of
a
sovereign
who
boasts
in
a
mutilated
inscription
that
he
had
pushed
his
victories
as
far
as
the
tigris

even
up
to
the
euphrates
nebuchadrezzar
brought
the
statue
back
to
babylon
after
many
vicissitudes
and
at
the
same
time
recovered
most
of
his
lost
provinces

he
had
to
leave
at
susa
the
bulk
of
the
trophies
which
had
been
collected
there
in
course
of
the
successful
wars
one

that
they

have

great
sources

come
into
conflict
with
the
northern
districts
of
elam
towards
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
and
more
recently
the
campaigns
of
shalmaneser
and
had
frequently
brought
these
sovereigns
into
contact
with
tribes
under
the
influence
of
susa
but
the
wildness
and
poverty
of
the
country
and
the
difficulties
it
offered
to
the
manoeuvres
of
large
armies
had
always
prevented
the
assyrian
generals
from
advancing
far
into
its
mountainous
regions
the
annexation
of
aramæan
territory
beyond
the
tigris
and
the
conquest
of
babylon
by
at
length
broke
through
the
barrier
and
brought
the
two
powers
face
to
face
at
a
point
where
they
could
come
into
conflict
without
being
impeded
by
almost
insurmountable
natural
obstacles
namely
in
the
plains
of
the
umliash
and
the
united
basins
of
the
lower
ulai
and
the
uknu
ten
experience
had
probably
sufficed
to
convince
of
the
dangers
to
which
the
neighbourhood
of
the
assyrians
exposed
his
subjects
the
vigilant
watch
which
the
kept
over
their
frontier
rendered
raiding
less
easy
and
if
one
of
the
border
chieftains
were
inclined
to
harry
as
of
old
an
unlucky
babylonian
or
cossæan
village
he
ran
the
risk
of
an
encounter
with
a
force
or
of
being
plundered
in
turn
by
way
of
reprisal
sargon
declares
distinctly
that
had
invoked
the
aid
of
an
irregular
but
abundant
source
of
revenue
was
thus
curtailed
without
taking
into
consideration
the
wars
to
which
such
incidents
must
perforce
lead
sooner
or
later
even
unaided
the
elamites
considered
themselves
capable
of
repelling
any
attack
allied
with
the
babylonians
or
the
kaldâ
they
felt
certain
of
victory
in
any
circumstances
sargon
realised
this
fact
almost
as
fully
as
did
the
elamites
themselves
as
soon
therefore
as
his
spies
had
forewarned
him
that
an
invasion
was
imminent
he
resolved
to
take
the
initiative
and
crush
his
enemies
singly
before
they
succeeded
in
uniting
their
forces
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
walls
of
durîlu
a
stronghold
which
commanded
the
umliash
and
he
there
awaited
the
advent
of
his
allies
before
laying
siege
to
the
town
it
was
however
the
assyrian
army
which
came
to
meet
him
and
offered
him
battle
the
conflict
was
a
sanguinary
one
as
became
an
engagement
between
such
valiant
foes
and
both
sides
claimed
the
victory
the
assyrians
maintained
forcing
the
elamites
to
evacuate
their
positions
and
tarried
some
weeks
longer
to
chastise
those
of
their
aramæan
subjects
who
had
made
common
cause
with
the
enemy
they
carried
away
the
tumuna
who
had
given
up
their
sheikh
into
the
hands
of
the
emissaries
of
the
kaldâ
and
transported
the
whole
tribe
without
making
any
attempt
to
save
his
allies
although
his
army
had
not
as
yet
struck
a
single
blow
the
history
of
this
first
campaign
against
baladan
which
is
found
in
a
mutilated
condition
in
the
of
exists
nowhere
else
in
a
complete
form
but
the
facts
are
very
concisely
referred
to
in
the
and
in
the
the
general
sequence
of
events
is
indicated
by
babylonian
but
the
author
places
them
in
the
second
year
of
baladan
contrary
to
the
testimony
of
the
and
attributes
the
victory
to
the
elamites
in
the
battle
of
durîlu
in
deference
to
babylonian
patriotism
the
course
of
events
after
the
battle
of
durflu
seems
to
prove
clearly
that
the
assyrians
remained
masters
of
the
field
having
accomplished
this
act
of
vengeance
the
assyrians
suspended
operations
and
returned
to
nineveh
to
repair
their
losses
probably
intending
to
make
a
great
effort
to
regain
the
whole
of
babylonia
in
the
ensuing
year
grave
events
which
occurred
elsewhere
prevented
them
however
from
carrying
this
ambitious
project
into
effect
the
fame
of
their
war
against
elam
had
spread
abroad
in
the
western
provinces
of
the
empire
and
doubtless
exaggerated
accounts
circulated
with
regard
to
the
battle
of
durîlu
had
roused
the
spirit
of
dissatisfaction
in
the
west
sargon
had
scarcely
seated
himself
securely
on
a
throne
to
which
he
was
not
the
direct
heir
when
he
was
menaced
by
elam
and
repudiated
by
chaldæa
and
it
remained
to
be
seen
whether
his
resources
would
prove
equal
to
maintaining
the
integrity
of
his
empire
or
whether
the
example
set
by
would
not
speedily
be
imitated
by
all
who
groaned
under
the
assyrian
yoke
since
the
decline
of
damascus
and
arpad
hamath
had
again
taken
a
prominent
place
in
northern
syria
prompt
submission
had
saved
this
city
from
destruction
in
the
time
of
and
it
had
since
prospered
under
the
foreign
rule
it
was
therefore
on
hamath

all
hopes
of
deliverance
still
cherished
by
rulers
and
people
now
centred
a
fellow
a
smith
named
iaubîdi
rose
in
rebellion
against
the
prince
of
hamath
for
being
enough
to
pay
tribute
proclaimed
himself
king
and
in
the
space
of
a
few
months
revived
under
his
own
leadership
the
coalition
which
hadadezer
and
rezon
ii
had
formed
in
days
gone
by
arpad
and
zimyra
and
northern
phoenicia
damascus
and
its
dependencies
all
expelled
their
assyrian
garrisons
and

still
suffering
from
its
overthrow

to
rid
itself
of
its
governor

hannon

city

carrying
on

a
view

persuading
egypt
to
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
syria
the
last
of
the
tanite
pharaohs
psamuti
was
just
dead
and
bocchoris
who
had
long
been
undisputed
master
of
the
delta
had
now
ventured
to
assume
the
diadem
openly
a
usurpation
which
the
ethiopians
fully
engaged
in
the
thebaid
and
on
the
upper
nile
seemed
to
regard
with
equanimity
as
soon
as
the
petty
kings
and
feudal
lords
had
recognised
his
suzerainty
bocchoris
favourably
to
the
entreaties
of
hannon
and
promised
to
send
an
army
to
gaza
under
the
command
of
his
general
shabê
sargon

with
the
loss
of
the
entire
western
half
of
his
empire
desisted
for
a
time
from
his
designs
on
babylon
was
wise
enough
to
refrain
from
provoking
an
enemy
who
left
him
in
peace
and
did
not
dare
to
enter
the
lists
without
the
support
of
his
confederate
the
victory
of
durîlu
though
it
had
not
succeeded
in
gaining
a
province
for
nineveh
had
at
least
secured
the
frontier
from
attack
at
all
events
for
so
long
as
it
should
please

to
remain
at
a
distance

of

were
demolished
and
the
city
obliged
to
furnish
a
force
of
two
hundred
charioteers
and
six
hundred
horsemen
probably
recruited
from
among
the
families
of

the
citizens
who
had
been
most
seriously
compromised
in

this
success
confirmed
the

ammon
and

in
their
allegiance
which
had
shown
signs
of
wavering
since

gaza
remained
unsubdued
and
caused
the
more
uneasiness
because
it
was
perceived
that
behind

was
arrayed

majesty
of

was

the
generals
and
soldiers
of
bocchoris
fighting
according
to
antiquated
methods
of
warfare
gave
way
before

their

the
manifest
superiority
of
assyria
was
evident
from
the
first
encounter
but
the
contest
had
been
so
fierce
and
the
result
so
doubtful
that
sargon
did
not
consider
it
prudent
to
press
his
advantage
he
judged
rightly
that
these
troops
whom
he
had
not
dispersed
without
considerable
effort
constituted
merely
an
advanced
guard
egypt
was
not
like
the
petty
kingdoms
of

minor
which
had
but
one
army
apiece
and
could
not
risk
more
than
one
pitched
battle
though

others
would
not
fail
to
take

filled

an
alien
army
might
penetrate
in

it

still
meet
with
the

of

egypt

seemed
to
recede

invader
advanced
and
which
was
ever
ready
to
oppose
the
enemy
with
fresh
forces
whenever
its
troops
had
suffered
from
his
attacks
sargon
having
reached
kaphia
halted
on
the
very
threshold
of
the
unexplored
realm
whose
portals
stood
ajar
ready
to
admit
him
the
same
vague
disquietude
which
had
checked
the
conquering
career
of
the
pharaohs
on
the
borders
of
asia
now
stayed
his
advance
and
bade
him
turn
back
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
entering
africa
he
had
repulsed
the
threatened
invasion
and
as
a
result
of
his
victory
the
princes
and
towns
which
had
invoked
the
aid
of
the
foreigner
lay
at
his
mercy
he
proceeded
therefore
to
reorganise
the
provinces
of
philistia
and
israel
and
received
the
homage
of
judah
and
her
dependencies
ahaz
while
all
the
neighbouring
states
were
in
revolt

not
wavered
in
his
allegiance

pacific
counsels
of
isaiah
had
once
more
prevailed
over
the
influence
of
the
party
which
looked
for
safety
in
an
alliance
with
egypt
sargon
probably
alludes
to
homage
received
at
this
time
when
he
styles
himself
subduer
of
it
is
not
certain
that
ahaz
was
still
king
of
judah
it
was
for
a
long
time
admitted
that
hezekiah
was
already
king
when
these
events
took
place
in
accordance
with
kings
xviii
where
it
is
stated
that
samaria
was
destroyed
in
the
sixth
year
of
hezekiah
i
consider
in
agreement
with
several
historians
that
the
date
of
invasion
of
judah
must
have
remained
more
firmly
fixed
in
the
minds
of
the
jewish
historians
than
that
of
the
taking
of
samaria
and
as
kings
xviii
places
this
invasion
in
the
fourteenth
year
of
hezekiah
which
corresponds
as
we
shall
see
to
the
third
year
of
sennacherib
or
it
seems
better
to
place
the
accession
of
hezekiah
about
and
prolong
the
reign
of
ahaz
till
after
the
campaign
of
sargon
against
hannon
of
gaza
the
whole
country
from
the
orontes
to
the
mountains
of
seir
and
the
river
of
egypt
was
again
reduced
to
obedience
and
set
itself
by
peaceful
labours
to
repair
the
misfortunes
which
had
befallen
it
during
the
previous
quarter
of
a
century
sargon
returned
to
his
capital
but
fate
did
not
yet
allow
him
to
renew
his
projects
against
babylon
barely
did
an
insurrection
break
out
in
any
part
of
the
country
on
the
accession
of
a
new
king
at
nineveh
without
awaking
echoes
in
the
distant
provinces
of
the
empire
the
report
of
a
revolt
in
chaldæa
roused
a
slumbering
dissatisfaction
among
the
syrians
and
finally
led
them
into
open
rebellion
the
episodes
of
the
syrian
campaign
narrated
in
armenia
or
on
the
slopes
of
the
taurus
with
the
thousand
embellishments
suggested
by
the
rancour
of
the
narrators
excited
the
minds
of
the
inhabitants
and
soon
rendered
an
outbreak
inevitable
the
danger
would
have
been
serious
if
the
suppressed
hatred
of
all
had
found
vent
at
the
same
moment
and
if
insurrections
in
five
or
six
different
parts
of
his
empire
had
to
be
faced
by
the
sovereign
simultaneously
but
as
a
rule
these
local
wars
broke
out
without
any
concentrated
plan
and
in
localities
too
remote
from
each
other
to
permit
of
any
possible
between
the
assailants
each
chief
before
attempting
to
assert
his
independence
seemed
to
wait
until
the
assyrians
had
had
ample
time
to
crush
the
rebel
who
first
took
the
field
having
done
which
they
could
turn
the
whole
of
their
forces
against
the
latest
foe
thus
iaubîdi
did
not
risk
a
campaign
till
the
fall
of
elam
and
karduniash
had
been
already
decided
on
the
field
of
durilu
in
the
same
way
the
nations
of
the
north
and
east
refrained
from
entering
the
lists
till
they
had
allowed
sargon
time
to
destroy
the
league
of
hamath
and
repel
the
attack
of
bharaoh
they
were
secretly
incited
to
rebellion
by
a
power
which
played
nearly
the
same
part
with
regard
to
them
that
egypt
had
played
in
southern
syria
urartu
had
received
a
serious
rebuff
in
and
the
burning
of
dhuspas
had
put
an
end
to
its
ascendency
but
the
victory
had
been
effected
at
the
cost
of
so
much
bloodshed
that
was
not
inclined
to
risk
losing
the
advantage
already
gained
by
pushing
it
too
far
he
withdrew
therefore
without
concluding
a
treaty
and
did
not
return
being
convinced
that
no
further
hostilities
would
be
attempted
till
the
vanquished
enemy
had
recovered
from
his
defeat
he
was
justified
in
his
anticipations
for
sharduris
died
about
without
having
again
taken
up
arms
and
his
son
busas
had
left
shalmaneser
unmolested
but
the
accession
of
sargon
and
the
revolts
which
harassed
him
had
awakened
in
busas
the
warlike
instincts
of
his
race
and
the
moment
appeared
advantageous
for
abandoning
his
policy
of
inactivity
the
name
of
this
king
is
usually
written
ursa
in
the
assyrian
inscriptions
but
the
of
give
in
each
case
the
form
rusa
in
accordance
with
which
sayce
had
already
identified
the
assyrian
form
ursa
or
rusa
with
the
form
rusas
found
on
some
urartian
monuments
belck
and
lehmann
have
discovered
several
monuments
of
this
rusas
son
of
sharduris
the
remembrance
of
the
successful
exploits
of
menuas
and
argistis
still
lived
in
the
minds
of
his
people
and
more
than
one
of
his
generals
had
entered
upon
their
military
careers
at
a
time
when
from
arpad
and
carchemish
to
the
country
of
the
medes
quite
a
third
of
the
territory
now
annexed
to
assyria
had
been
subject
to
the
king
of
urartu
eusas
therefore
doubtless
placed
before
himself
the
possibility
of
reconquering
the
lost
provinces
and
even
winning
by
a
stroke
of

than
had
been

a
stroke
of
fortune
wrested
from
his
father
he
began
by
intriguing
with
such
princes
as
were
weary
of
the
assyrian
rule
among
the
mannai
in
zikartu
among
the
tabal
and
even
among
the
khâti
zikruti
zikirtu
zikartu
may
probably
be
identified
with
the
sagartians
of
herodotus
iranzu
who
was
at
that
time
reigning
over
the
mannai
refused
to
listen
to
the
suggestions
of
his
neighbour
but
two
of
his
towns
shuandakhul
and
durdukka
deserted
him
in
and
ranged
themselves
under
mitâtti
chief
of
the
zikartu
while
about
the
same
time
the
strongholds
of
sukkia
bala
and
abitikna
which
were
on
the
borders
of
urartu
broke
the
ties
which
had
long
bound
them
to
assyria
and
concluded
a
treaty
of
alliance
with
rusas
sargon
was
not
deceived
as
to
the
meaning
of
these
events
and
at
once
realised
that
this
movement
was
not
one
of
those
local
agitations
which
broke
out
at
intervals
in
one
or
other
of
his
provinces
his
officers
and
spies
must
have
kept
him
informed
of
the
machinations
of
eusas
and
of
the
revolutions
which
the
migrations
of
the
last
thirty
years
had
provoked
among
the
peoples
of
the
iranian
a
new
race
had
arisen
in
their
rear
that
of
the
cimmerians
and
scythians
which
issuing
in
irresistible
waves
from
the
gorges
of
the
caucasus
threatened
to
overwhelm
the
whole
ancient
world
of
the
east
the
stream
after
a
vacillation
took
a
westerly
direction
and
flooded
asia
minor
from
one
end
to
the
other
some
tribes
however
which
had
detached
themselves
from
the
main
movement
sought
an
outlet
towards
the
on
to
the
rich
plains
of
the
araxes
and
the
country
around
lake
urumiah
the
native
races
pressed
in
the
rear
by
these
barbarians
and
hemmed
in
on
either
side
and
in
front
by
urartu
and
assyria
were
forced
into
closer
proximity
and
conscious
of
their
individual
weakness
had
begun
to
form
themselves
into
three
distinct
groups
varying
considerably
in
compactness
the
medes
in
the
south
misianda
in
the
north
with
zikartu
between
them
zikartu
was
at
that
time
the
best
organised
of
these
nascent
states
and
its
king
mitâtti
was
not
deficient
either
in
military
talent
or
political
sagacity
the
people
over
whom
he
ruled
were
moreover
impregnated
with
the
civilisation
of
mesopotamia
and
by
constantly
meeting
the
assyrians
in
battle
they
had
adopted
the
general
principles
of
their
equipment
organisation
and
military
tactics
the
vigour
of
his
soldiers
and
the
warlike
ardour
which
inspired
them
rendered
his
armies
formidable
even
to
leaders
as
experienced
and
warriors
as
hardened
as
the
officers
and
soldiers
of
nineveh
mitâtti
had
strongly
garrisoned
the
two
rebel
cities
and
trusted
that
if
the
assyrians
were
unable
to
recapture
them
without
delay
other
towns
would
not
be
long
in
following
their
example
iranzu
would
no
doubt
be
expelled
his
place
would
be
taken
by
a
hostile
chief
and
the
mannai
joining
hands
with
urartu
on
the
right
and
zikartu
on
the
left
would
with
these
two
states
form
a
compact
coalition
whose
combined
forces
would
menace

northern
frontier

awakened

with

foundered
one
of

most
glorious
wrecks
of
the
ancient
world
for
more
than
a
century
the
khâti
had
been
the
dominant
power
in

had
successfully

power
of

crushed
by
the
peoples
of
the
sea
hemmed
in
and
encroached
upon
by
the
rising
wave
of
aramæan
invasion
they
had
yet
disputed
their
territory
step
by
step
with
the
assyrian
generals
and
the
area
over
which
they
spread
can
be
traced
by
the
monuments
and
inscriptions
scattered
over
cilicia
lycaonia
cappadocia
and
northern
syria
as
far
as
the
basins
of
the
orontes
and
the
litâny
so
lasting
had
proved
their
influence
on
all
around
them
and
so
fresh
was
the
memory
of
their
greatness
that
it
would
have
seemed
but
natural
that
their
vitality
should
survive
this
last
blow
and
that
they
should
enjoy
a
prosperous
future
which
should
vie
with
their
past
but
events
proved
that
their
national
life
was
dead
and
that
no
recuperative
power
remained
as
soon
as
sargon
had
overthrown
their
last
prince
their
tribes
became
merged
in
the
general
body
of
aramæans
and
their
very
name
ere
long
vanished
from
the
pages
of
history
up
to
this
time
eusas
had
not
directly
interfered
in
these
quarrels
between
the
suzerain
and
his
vassals
he
may
have
incited
the
latter
to
revolt
but
he
had
avoided
compromising
himself
and
was
waiting
till
the
mannai
had
decided
to
make
common
cause
with
him
before
showing
his
hand
openly
ever
since
the
skirmish
of
the
year
mitâtti
had
actively
striven
to
tempt
the
mannai
from
their
allegiance
but
his
intrigues
had
hitherto
proved
of
no
avail
against
the
staunch
fidelity
first
of
irânzu
and
then
of
azâ
who
had
succeeded
the
latter
about
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
mitâtti
was
more
successful
the
mannai
seduced
at
length
by
his
promises
and
those
of
eusas
assembled
on
mount
uaush
murdered
their
king
and
leaving
his
corpse
unburied
hastened
to
place
themselves
under
the
command
of
bagadatti
regent
of
umildîsh
sargon
hurried
to
the
spot
seized
bagadatti
and
had
him
flayed
alive
on
mount
uaush
which
had
just
witnessed
the
murder
of
azâ
and
exposed
the
mass
of
bleeding
flesh
before
the
gaze
of
the
people
to
demonstrate
the
fate
reserved
for
his
enemies
but
though
he
had
acted
speedily
he
was
too
late
and
the
fate
of
their
chief
far
from
discouraging
his
subjects
confirmed
them
in
their
rebellion
they
had
placed
upon
the
throne
ullusunu
the
brother
of
azâ
and
this
prince
had
immediately
concluded
an
alliance
with
eusas
mitâtti
and
the
people
of
andia
his
example
was
soon
followed
by
other
eastern
chiefs
assurlî
of
karallu
and

by

which
eusas
had
for
five
years
been
fomenting

despite
all
the
efforts
of
the
assyrian
government
at
last
broken
out
and
the
whole
frontier
was
ablaze
from
the
borders
of
elam
to
those
of
the
mushku
sargon
turned
his
attention
to
where
danger
was
most
urgent
he
made
a
descent
on
the
territory
of
the
mannai
and
laid
it
waste
a
swarm
of
locusts
might
have
done
he
burnt
their
capital
izirtu
demolished
the
fortifications
of
zibia
and
armaîd
and
took
ullusunu
captive
but
instead
of
condemning
him
to
death
he
restored
to
him
his
liberty
and
his
crown
on
condition
of
his
paying
a
regular
tribute
this
act
of
clemency
in
contrast
with
the
pitiless
severity
shown
at
the
beginning
of
the
insurrection
instantly
produced
the
good
effects
he
expected
the
mannai
laid
down
their
arms
and
swore
allegiance
to
the
conqueror
and
their
defection
broke
up
the
coalition
sargon
did
not
give
the
revolted
provinces
time
to
recover
from
the
dismay
into
which
his
first
victories
had
thrown
them
but
marched
rapidly
to
the
south
and
crushed
them
severally
commencing
with
andia
where
he
took
prisoners
with
their
cattle
he
next
attacked
zikartu

in

never
had
so
great
a

ably

averted
it
was
not
without
good
reason
that
after

of

it

to

to
reflect

ended
in

the
situation
was

with

is
admitted
by
all

as
soon
as

had

entered

surrounded
by

whom
terror
alone
held
to
their
allegiance
and
whom
the
slightest
imprudence
or
the
least
reverse
might
turn
into
open
foes
sargon
resolutely
faced
the
enemy
at
all
three
points
of
attack
as
in
the
previous
year
he
reserved
for
himself
the
position

of
homage
proceeding

sargon
reached

took

its
king
tilusînas

by
this
exploit
reduced
the
province

to
order

restored

done

he
retraced

his
real
character
is
unknown
but
as
he
left
a
deep
impression
on
the
memories
of
his
people
it
is
natural
to
conclude
that
he
displayed
at
times
both
ability
and
energy
many
legends
in
which
the
miraculous
element
prevailed
were
soon
in
circulation
concerning
him
he
was
according
to
these
accounts
weak
in
body
and
insignificant
in
appearance
but
made
up
for
these
defects
by
mental
ability
and
sound
judgment
he
was
credited
with
having
been
simple
in
his
mode
of
life
and
was
renowned
as
one
of
the
six
great
legislators
produced
by
egypt
a
law
concerning
debt
and
the
legal
rates
of
interest
was
attributed
to
him
he
was
also
famed
for
the
uprightness
of
his
judgments
which
were
regarded
as
due
to
divine
inspiration
isis
had
bestowed
on
him
a
serpent
which
coiling
itself
round
his
head
when
he
sat
on

him
with
its
shadow
and
admonished
him
not
to
forget
for
a
moment

inflexible
principles
of
equity

of

there
is
therefore
no

to
add
them
to

was
reputed
to
have
delivered
in
famous
cases
existed
in
the
period
and
one
of
them
is
quoted
at
length
he
had
very
ingeniously
condemned
a
courtesan
to

shadow
of
a
purse
as
payment
for
the
shadowy

the

the

at

in

the

the
famous
judgment
of
solomon
kings
iii
a
less
favourable
tradition
represents
the
king
as
an
avaricious
and
irreligious
sovereign
he
is
said
one
day
to
have
conceived
the
sacrilegious
desire
to
bring
about
a
conflict
between
an
ordinary
bull
and
the
mnevis
adored
at
heliopolis
the
gods
doubtless
angered
by
his
crimes
are
recorded
to
have
called
into
being
a
lamb
with
eight
feet
which
suddenly
breaking
into
articulate
speech
predicted
that
upper
and
lower
egypt
would
be
disgraced
by
the
rule
of

stranger
this
legend
preserved
by
manetho
and

is
also
known
from
the
fragments
of
a

papyrus
at
vienna

contains
the
prophecy
of
the

illustration
sabaco
drawn
by
from
lepsius
the
monuments
of
his
reign
which
have
come
down
to
us
tell
us
nothing
of
his
deeds
we
can
only
conjecture
that
after
the
defeat
sustained
by
his
generals
at
raphia
the
discords
which
had
ruined
the
preceding
dynasties
again
broke
out
with
renewed
violence
indeed
if
he
succeeded
in
preserving
his
crown
for
several
years
longer
he
owed
the
fact
more
to
the
feebleness
of
the
ethiopians
than
to
his
own
vigour
no
sooner
did
an
enterprising
prince
appear
at
barkal
and
demand
that
he
should
render
an
account
of
his
usurpation
than
his
power
came
to
an
end
kashto

died

his

shapenuapît
the
date
of
the
accession
of
sabaco
is
here
fixed
at
because
i
follow
the
version
of
the
lists
of
manetho
which
gives
twelve
years
as
the
reign
of
that
prince
an
inscription
from
hammamât
mentions
his
twelfth
year
sabaco
was
an
able
and
energetic
prince
who
could
by
no
means
tolerate
the
presence
of
a
rival
pharaoh
in
the
provinces
which
piônkhi
had
conquered
he
declared
war
and
being
doubtless
supported
in
his
undertaking
by
all
the
petty
kings
and
great
feudal
nobles
whose
jealousy
was
aroused
by
the
prosperity
of
the
saite
monarch
he
defeated
bocchoris
and
took
him
prisoner
tafnakhti
had
formerly
recognised
the
ethiopian
supremacy
and
bocchoris
when
he
succeeded
to
his
dominions
had
himself
probably
sought
investiture
at
the
hands
of
the
king
of
napata
sabaco
treated
him
as
a
rebel
and
either
burnt
or
flayed
him
alive
according
to
manetho
he
was
burnt
alive
the
tradition
which
mentions
that
he
was
flayed
alive
is
found
in
john
of
antioch
the
struggle
was
hardly
over
when
the
news
of
victories
reached
egypt
it
was
natural
that
the
new
king
not
yet
securely
seated
on
his
throne
should
desire
to
conciliate
the
friendship
of
a
neighbour
who
was
so
successful
in
war
and
that
he
should
seize
the
first
available
pretext
to
congratulate
him
the
assyrian
on
his
part
received
these
advances
with
satisfaction
and
pride
he
perceived
in
them
a
guarantee
that
egyptian
intrigues
with
tyre
and
jerusalem
would
cease
and
that
he
could
henceforth
devote
himself
to
his
projects
against
busas
without
being
distracted
by
the
fear
of
an
ethiopian
attack
and
the
subversion
of
syria
in
his
rear
sargon
took
advantage
of
these
circumstances
to
strike
a
final
blow
at
urartu
he
began
in
the
spring
of
by
collecting
among
the
mannai
the
tribute
due
from
ullusuna
daltâ
and
the
median
chiefs
then
pushing
forward
into
the
country
of
the
zikartu
he
destroyed
three
forts
and
villages
and
burnt
their
capital
parda
mitatti
escaped
servitude
but
it
was
at
the
price
of
his
power
a
proscribed
fugitive
deserted
by
his
followers
he
took
refuge
in
the
woods
and
never
submitted
to
his
conqueror
but
he
troubled
him
no
further
and
disappeared
from
the
pages
of
history
having
achieved
this
result
sargon
turned
towards
the
and
coming
at
length
into
close
conflict
with
eusas
did
not
leave
his
enemy
till
he
had
crushed
him
he
drove
him
into
the
gorges
of
uaush
slaughtered
a
large
number
of
his
troops
and
swept
away
the
whole
of
his
a
body
of
cavalry
of
two
hundred
men
all
of
whom
were
connected
by
blood
with
the
reigning
family
eusas
quitted
his
chariot
and
like
his
father
sharduris
on
the
night
of
the
disaster
at
kishtân
leaped
upon
a
mare
and
fled
overwhelmed
with
shame
into
the
mountains
his
towns
opened
their
gates
at
the
first
summons
to
the
victor
sargon
burnt
those
which
he
knew
he
could
not
retain
granted
the
district
of
uaush
to
his
vassal
ullusunu
as
a
recompense
for
his
loyalty
and
then
marched
up
to
rest
awhile
in
naîri
where
he
revictualled
his
troops
at
the
expense
of
ianzu
of
khubushkia
he
had
no
doubt
hoped
that
urzana
of
muzazîr
the
last
of
the
friends
of
eusas
to
hold
out
against
assyria
would
make
good
use
of
the
respite
thus
to
all
appearances
unintentionally
afforded
him
and
would
come
to
terms
but
as
the
appeal
to
his
clemency
was
delayed
sargon
suddenly
determined
to
assume
the
aggressive
muzazîr
entrenched
within
its
mountain
ranges
was
accessible
only
by
one
or
two
dangerous
passes
urzana
had
barricaded
these
and
believed
himself
in
a
position
to
defy
every
effort
of
the
assyrians
sargon
equally
convinced
of
the
futility
of
a
front
attack
had
recourse
to
a
surprise

preserved
at
the
hague
the
disaster
at
muzazîr
was
the
final
blow
to
urartu
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
took
place
where
eusas
himself
was
and
whether
the
feudatories
refused
him
any
further
allegiance
but
in
a
short
time
he
found
himself
almost
forsaken
without
friends
troops
or
a
place
of
refuge
and
reduced
to
choose
between
death
or
the
degradation
of
appealing
to
the
mercy
of
the
conqueror
he
stabbed
himself
rather
than
yield
and
sargon
only
too
thankful
to
be
rid
of
such
a
dangerous
adversary
stopped
the
pursuit
argistis
ii
succeeded
to
what
was
left
of
his
kingdom
and
being
anxious
above
all
things
to
obtain
peace
for
his
subjects
suspended
hostilities
without
however
disarming
his
troops
no
text
states
positively
that
argistis
ii
immediately
succeeded
his
father
but
he
is
found
mentioned
as
king
of
urartu
from
onwards
and
hence
it
has
been
concluded
not
without
some
reason
that
such
was
the
fact
the
vannic
inscriptions
have
not
as
yet
given
us
this
name
as
was
the
case
under
urartu
neither
submitted
to
assyria
nor
was
there
any
kind
of
treaty
between
the
belligerents
to
prescribe
the
conditions
of
this
temporary
truce
both
sides
maintained
their
positions
on
their
respective
territories
sargon
kept
the
frontier
towns
acquired
by
him
in
previous
years
and
which
he
had
annexed
to
the
border
provinces
retaining
also
his
suzerainty
over
muzazîr
the
mannai
and
the
median
states
implicated
in
the
struggle
argistis
on
his
side
strengthened
himself
in
the
regions
around
the
sources
of
the
euphrates
and
lake
van
in
biaînas
in
etius
and
in
the
plains
of
the
araxes
the
material
injuries
which
he
had
received
however
considerable
they
may
appear
were
not
irreparable
and
as
a
fact
the
country
quickly
recovered
from
them
but
the
confidence
in
their
prince
and
his
chiefs
was
destroyed
the
defeat
of
sharduris
following
as
it
did
on
a
period
of
advantageous
victories
may
have
seemed
to
argistis
one
of
those
unimportant
occurrences
which
constantly
take
place
in
the
career
of
the
strongest
nations
the
disaster
of
rusas
proved
to
him
that
in
attempting
to
wipe
out
his
first
repulse
he
had
only
made
matters
worse
and
the
conviction
was
borne
in
upon
his
princes
that
they
were
not
in
a
position
to
contest
the
possession
of
western
asia
with
the
assyrians
they
therefore
renounced
more
from
instinct
than
as
the
result
of
deliberation
the
project
of
enlarging
their
borders
to
the
south
and
if
they
subsequently
reappeared
on
the
mesopotamian
plains
it
was
in
search
of
booty
and
not
to
acquire
territory
any
attempt
to
stop
their
incursions
or
to
disturb
them
in
their
mountain
fastnesses
found
them
prepared
to
hold
their
own
with
the
same
obstinacy
as
of
old
and
they
were
quite
able
to
safeguard
their
independence
against
an
intruder
besides
this
the
cimmerians
and
the
scythians
were
already
pressing
on
their
frontier
and
were
constantly
harassing
them
illustration
the
assyrians
taking
a
median
town
drawn
by
from
the
facsimile
by
flandin
it
seems
that
this
town
was
called
amkaru
and
its
name
appears
as
far
as
i
know
in
none
of
the
accounts
which
we
possess
of
the
campaigns
the
town
was
apparently
situated
in
karalla
or
in
median
territory
this
fresh
danger
absorbed
their
entire
attention
and
from
this
time
forward
they
ceased
to
play
a
part
in
general
history
the
century
which
had
seen
the
rise
and
growth
of
their
power
was
also
a
witness
of
their
downfall
under
the
attacks
of
assyria
during
the
last
months
of
the
tribes
which
had
formerly
constituted
the
kingdom
of
karalla
mutinied
against
the
tyranny
of
their
governor
and
invited
the
brother
of
their
ancient
lord
assurlî
to
rule
over
them
sargon
attacked
them
in
the
spring
of
dispersed
their
troops
held
them
to
ransom
and
after
having
once
more
exacted
homage
from
ellipi
and
allabria
the
dayaukku
who
gave
his
name
to
this
province
was
at
first
confounded
with
the
personage
who
was
entangled
in
the
affairs
of
ullusunu
and
was
then
banished
by
sargon
to
hamath
a
good
number
of
historians
now
admit
that
they
were
different
persons
is
evidently
the

as
far
as
the

the

the

they
are
those
mentioned
in

of
appian

with
parthians
bactrians
and
tapyræans
as
having
submitted
to
seleucus
the
manda
encamped
in
the
mountain
and
desert
and
who
were
named
after
the
eastern
arabs
must
be
the
peoples
situated
between
the
caspian
and
the
steppes
of
the
iranian
plateau
and
a
branch
of
the
scythians
who
are
soon
to
appear
in
asiatic
history
while
he
was
thus
preparing
the
way
for
peace
in
his
median
domains
one
of
his
generals
crossed
the
euphrates
to
chastise
the
tabal
for
their
ill
deeds
the
latter
had
figured
about
the
year
among
the
peoples
who
had
bowed
before
the
supremacy
of
urartu
and
their
chief
uassarmi
had
been
the
ally
or
vassal
of
sharduris
contemptuously
spared
at
the
taking
of
arpad
he
had
not
been
able
to
resign
himself
to
the
assyrian
yoke
and
had
in
an
moment
thrown
it
off
in
he
had
however
been
overcome
and
forced
to
surrender
and
had
put
in
his
place
a
man
of
obscure
birth
named
khulli
whose
fidelity
had
remained
unshaken
throughout
the
reign
of
shalmaneser
and
the
first
years
of
sargon
son
ambaridis
the
husband
of
a
ninevite
princess
who
had
brought
him
as
dowry
a
considerable
part
of
cilicia
had
been
unable
to
resist
the
flattering
offers
of
kusas
he
had
broken
the
ties
which
attached
him
to
the
new
assyrian
dynasty
but
had
been
left
unmolested
so
long
as
urartu
and
muzazir
remained
unshaken
since
his
position
at
the
western
extremity
of
the
empire
prevented
him
from
influencing
in
the
smallest
degree
the
issue
of
the
struggle
and
it
was
well
known
that
when
the
fall
of
kusas
took
place
ambaridis
would
be
speedily
brought
to
account
he
was
in
fact
seized
banished
to
the
banks
of
the
tigris
and
his
hereditary
fief
of
annexed
to
cilicia
under
the
rule
of
an
assyrian
the
following
year
was
signalised
by
a
similar
execution
at
which
sargon
himself
deigned
to
preside
in
person
tarkhunazi
the
king
of
miliddu
not
only
had
taken
advantage
of
the
troubles
consequent
on
the
armenian
war
to
rebel
against
his
master
but
had
attacked
gunzinânu
who
held
and
had
ruthlessly
pillaged
the
neighbouring
district
of
kammanu
sargon
overcame
him
in
the
open
field
took
from
him
his
city
of
miliddu
and
stormed
the
town
of
tulgarimmê
in
which
he
had
taken
refuge
kammanu
is
probably
not
the
kammanênc
of
the
greek
geographers
which
is
too
far
north
relatively

separated
these
two
countries
sometimes
rivals

always
enemies

its
maintenance
as
an
independent

them
from
combining

obtaining
that
unity
of

ensure
for

not
a

from

extinction
and
an
opportunity
of
maintaining

the
importance
of
the
position
however
rendered
it
particularly
perilous
to
hold
and
the
assyrians
succeeded
in
so
doing
only
by
strongly
fortifying
it

built
round

more

having
served
sharduris
had
transferred
his
homage
to
and
he
had
thenceforward
professed
an
unwavering
loyalty
to
the
assyrian
sovereigns
this
accommodating
personage
was
assassinated
by
his
son
mutallu
and
sargon
fearing
a
revolt
hastened
at
the
head
of
a
detachment
of
picked
troops
to
avenge
him
the
murderer
threw
down
his
arms
almost
without
having
struck

and
gurgum
was
thenceforward
placed

had
not
been
brought
to

outbreak

openly
before
the
death
of

she
had
renewed

with
the
petty
kingdoms
of
the
hebrews

philistines
ashdod
had
for
some
time
past
showed
signs
of
discontent
and
it
had
been
found
necessary
to
replace
their
king
azuri
who
had
refused
to
pay
tribute
by
his
brother
akhimiti
shortly
after
this
however
the
people
had
risen
in
rebellion
they
had
massacred
akhimiti
whom
they
accused
of
being
a
mere
thrall
of
assyria
and
had
placed
on
the
throne
yamani
a
soldier
of
fortune
probably
an
adventurer
of
hellenic
extraction
the
other
philistine
cities
had
immediately
taken
up
arms
edom
and
moab
were
influenced
by
the
general
movement
and
isaiah
was
striving
to
avert
any
imprudent
step
on
the
part
of
judah
sargon
despatched
the
tartan
and
the
rapidity
with
which
that
officer
carried
out
the
campaign
prevented
the
movement
from
spreading
beyond
philistia
he
devastated
ashdod
and
its
vassal
gath
carried
off
their
gods
and
their
inhabitants
and
peopled
the
cities
afresh
with
prisoners
from

yamani
attempted
to
escape
into
egypt
but
the
chief
of
milukhkha
intercepted
him
on
his
way
and
handed
him
over
in
chains
to
the
conqueror
this
name
usually
written
yamani
is
also
written
yatnani
in
the
and
this
variation
which
is
found
again
in
the
name
of
the
island
of
cyprus
and
the
cypriotes
gives
us
grounds
for
believing
that
the
assyrian
scribe
took
the
of
the
prince
for
a
proper
name
the
new
king
of
ashdod
would
have
been
a
yamani
a
greek
of
cyprus
the
assyrian
narratives
as
usual
give
the
honour
of
conducting
the
campaign
to
the
king
isaiah
xx
distinctly
says
that
sargon
sent
the
tartan
to
quell
the
revolt
of
ashdod
the
state
that
yamani
was
made
prisoner
and
taken
to
assyria
the
more
accurate
on
this
point
state
that
he
escaped
to
muzri
and
that
he
was
given
up
by
the
king
of
milukhkha
the
muzri
mentioned
in
this
passage
very
probably
here
means
egypt
the
latter
took
care
not
to
call
either
moab
edom
or
judah
to
account
for
the
part
they
had
taken
in
the
movement
perhaps
because
they
were
not
mentioned
in
his
instructions
or
because
he
preferred
not
to
furnish
them
by
an
untimely
interference
with
a
pretext
for
calling
in
the
help
of
egypt
the
year
was
doubtless
too
far
advanced
to
allow
him
to
dream
of
marching
against
pharaoh
and
moreover
that
would
have
been
one
of
those
important
steps
which
the
king
alone
had
the
right
to
take
there
was
however
no
doubt
that
the
encounter
between
the
two
empires
was
imminent
and
isaiah
ventured
to
predict
the
precise
date
of
its
occurrence
he
walked
stripped
and
barefoot
through
the
streets
of
jerusalem
a
strange
procedure
which
he
explained
by
the
words
which
jahveh
had
put
into
his
lips
as
my
servant
isaiah
hath
walked
naked
and
barefoot
three
years
for
a
sign
and
a
wonder
upon
egypt
and
upon
kush
ethiopia
so
shall
the
king
of
assyria
lead
away
the
captives
of
egypt
and
the
exiles
of
kush
young
and
old
naked
and
barefoot
and
with
buttocks
uncovered
to
the
shame
of
egypt
and
they
shall
be
dismayed
and
ashamed
because
of
kush
their
expectation
and
of
egypt
their
glory
and
the
inhabitants
of
this
coastland
shall
say
in
that
day
behold
such
is
our
expectation
whither
we
fled
for
help
to
be
delivered
from
the
king
of
assyria
and
we
how
shall
we
escape
isa
xx
the
fulfilment
of
this
prophecy
did
not
take
place
as
quickly
as
the
prophet
perhaps
desired
egypt
appeared
too
strong
to
be
openly
attacked
by
a
mere
section
of
the
battalions
at
the
disposal
of
assyria
and
besides
it
may
have
been
deemed
imprudent
to
involve
the
army
to
any
serious
extent
on
so
distant
a
field
as
africa
when
babylon
was
ready
and
waiting
to
fall
upon
the
very
heart
of
assyria
at
the
first
news
of
a
real
or
supposed
reverse
circumstances
seemed
moreover
to
favour
a
war
against
this
sovereign
who
had
been
received
with
acclamation
by
the
babylonians
had
already
lost
the
popularity
he
had
enjoyed
at
his
accession
the
fickle
character
of
the
people
which
made
them
nearly
always
welcome
a
fresh
master
with
enthusiasm
soon
led
them
from
love
and
obedience
to
hatred
and
finally
to
revolt
trusted
to
the
kaldâ
to
help
him
to
maintain
his
position
and
their
rude
barbarity
even
if
it
protected
him
against
the
fickleness
of
his
more
civilised
subjects
increased
the
discontent
at
kutha
sippar
and
borsippa
he
removed
the
statues
of
the
gods
from
these
towns
imprisoned
the
most
turbulent
citizens
confiscated
their
goods
and
distributed
them
among
his
own
followers
the
other
cities
took
no
part
in
the
movement
but
sargon
must
have
expected
to
find
in
them
if
not
effective
support
at
least
sympathies
which
would
facilitate
his
work
of
conquest
it
is
true
that
elam
whose
friendship
for
the
aramæan
was
still
undiminished
remained
to
be
reckoned
with
but
elam
had
lost
much
of
its
prestige
in
the
last
few
years
the
aged
had
died
in
and
his
successor
had
not
apparently
inherited
all
the
energy
of
his
father
and
it
is
possible
that
troubles
had
arisen
among
the
vassals
of
his
own
kingdom
which
prevented
him
from
interfering
on
behalf
of
his
ally
sargon
took
account
of
all
these
circumstances
in
arranging
his
plan
of
campaign
he
divided
his
army
into
two
forces
one
of
which
under
his
own
command
was
to
be
directed
against
while
the
other
was
to
attack
the
insurgent
aramæans
on
the
left
bank
of
the
tigris
and
was
to
be
manoeuvred
so
as
to
drive
back
on
the
marshes
of
the
uknu
the
eastern
force
was
the
first
to
be
set
in
movement
and
it
pushed
forward
into
the
territory
of
the
gambulu
these
latter
had
concentrated
themselves
round
one
of
their
citadels
they
had
increased
the
height
of
the
walls
and
filled
the
ditches
with
water
brought
from
the
shurappu
by
means
of
a
canal
and
having
received
a
reinforcement
of
horsemen
and
foot
soldiers
they
had
drawn
them
up
in
front
of
the
ramparts
the
date
of
the
death
of
is
indirectly
given
in
the
passage
of
the
chronicle
of
where
it
is
said
that
in
the
first
year
of
shumu
king
of
babylon
was
dethroned
by
his
brother
khallushu
after
having
reigned
over
elam
eighteen
years
these
events
actually
took
place
as
we
shall
see
below
about
the
year
before
our
era
is
the
susian
form
of
the
name
the
assyrian
texts
distort
it
into
and
the
chronicle
of
into
owing
to
a
faint
resemblance
in
the
sound
of
the
name
of
the
goddess
ishtar
with
the
form
itself
derived
from
shutruk
with
which
the
name
began
the
earlier
historians
of
assyria
misled
in
the
first
place
by
the
form
in
which
the
scribes
have
handed
down
the
account
in
the
annals
and
the
assumed
the
existence
of
a
single
army
led
by
sargon
himself
and
which
would
have
marched
on
all
the
places
of
the
country
one
by
one
tiele
was
the
first
to
recognise
that
sargon
must
have
left
part
of
his
forces
to
the
command
of
one
of
his
lieutenants
and
winckler
enlarging
on
this
idea
showed
that
there
were
then
two
armies
engaged
at
different
seats
of
war
but
manoeuvring
as
far
as
possible
by
mutual
arrangement
the
site
of
is
unknown
billerbeck
places
it
on
the
stream
of
mendeli
and
his
conjecture
is
in
itself
very
plausible
i
should
incline
however
to
place
it
more
to
the
south
on
account
of
the
passage
in
which
it
is
said
that
the
kaldâ
to
complete
the
defences
of
the
town
brought
a
canal
from
the
shurappu
and
fortified
its
banks
the
shurappu
according
to
delitzsch
would
be
the
shatt
according
to
delattrc
the
kerkha
the
account
of
the
campaign
under
consideration
would
lead
me
to
recognise
in
it
a
watercourse
like
the
tib
which
runs
into
the
tigris
near
amara
in
which
case
the
ruins
of
kherîb
would
perhaps
correspond
with
the
site
of
a
single
morning
sufficed
to
disperse
them
and
the
assyrians
entering
the
city
with
the
fugitives
took
possession
of
it
on
the
same
day
they
made
prisoners
and
seized
horses
mules
asses
camels
and
both
sheep
and
oxen
in
large
numbers
eight
of
the
chiefs
of
the
neighbourhood
who
ruled
over
the
flat
country
between
the
shurappu
and
the
uknu
begged
for
mercy
as
soon
as
they
learned
the
result
of
the
engagement
the
name
of
was
changed
to
that
of
the
territory
of
the
gambulu
was
converted
into
a
province
and
its
organisation
having
been
completed
the
army
continued
its
march
sweeping
before
it
the
euâ
the
khindaru
the
puqudu
in
short
all
the
tribes
occupying
the
district
of
yatbur
the
chiefs
of
these
provinces
sought
refuge
in
the
morasses
of
the
lower
kerkha
but
finding
themselves
surrounded
and
short
of
provisions
they
were
forced
by
famine
to
yield
to
the
enemy
and
came
to
terms
with
the
assyrians
who
imposed
a
tribute
on
them
and
included
them
within
the
new
province
of
gambulu
the
goal
of
this
expedition
was
thus
attained
and
blam
separated
from
karduniash
but
the
issue
of
the
war
remained
undecided
as
long
as
held
the
cities
at
the
edge
of
the
plain
from
which
he
could
emerge
at
will
into
the
heart
of
the
assyrian
position
the
conqueror
therefore
turned
in
that
direction
rapidly
took
from
him
the
citadels
of
shamuna
and
babduri
then
those
of
lakhirimmu
and
pillutu
and
pitched
his
camp
on
the
bank
of
the
naditi
from
whence
he
despatched
marauding
bands
to
pillage
the
country
dismay
spread
throughout
the
district
of
rashi
the
inhabitants
abandoning
their
cities
durmishamash
bubî
and
khamanu
migrated
as
far
as
overcome
with
fear
took
refuge
so
it
was
said
in
the
distant
mountains
to
preserve
his
life
none
of
these
places
can
be
identified
with
certainty
so
far
as
i
can
follow
the
account
of
this
campaign
on
the
map
it
seems
that
the
attacks
upon
took
place
on
the
plain
and
in
the
mountains
between
the
and
the
tib
so
that
the
river
naditi
would
be
the
aftâh
or
one
of
its
tributaries
if
this
were
so
lakhirimmu
and
pillutu
would
be
situated
somewhere
near
the
jughaî
ben
ruan
and
the
tope
ghulamen
of
de
map
of
elam
shamuna
near
babdurî
near
but
i
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
i
do
not
consider
these
comparisons
as
more
than
simple
conjectures
was
certainly
out
of
the
reach
of
the
assyrians
since
it
was
used
as
a
place
of
refuge
by
the
inhabitants
of
rashî
at
the
same
time
it
must
have
been
close
to
rashî
since
the
people
of
this
country
fled
thither
the
site
of
ghilân
which
de
morgan
has
adopted
on
his
map
seems
to
me
to
be
too
far
north
to
comply
with
these
conditions
and
that
of
tapa
approved
by
billerboek
too
southerly
if
as
i
believe
rashî
corresponds
to
the
regions
of
which
lie
on
both
sides
of
the
upper
waters
of
the
mendeli
stream
we
ought
to
look
for
somewhere
near
the
and
the
zenjan
near
a
point
where
communication
with
the
banks
of
the
would
be
easy
sargon
meanwhile
had
crossed
the
euphrates
with
the
other
force
and
had
marched
straight
upon
having
there
noticed
that
the
fortress
of
was
in
ruins
he
rebuilt
it
and
firmly
installed
within
the
heart
of
the
country
he
patiently
waited
until
the
eastern
force
had
accomplished
its
mission
like
his
adversary
he
had
no
desire
to
be
drawn
into
an
engagement
until
he
knew
what
chance
there
was
of
the
latter
being
reinforced
by
the
king
of
elam
at
the
opening
of
hostilities
claimed
the
help
of
the
elamite
king
and
lavished
on
him
magnificent
presents
a
couch
a
throne
a
portable
chair
a
cup
for
the
royal
offerings
and
his
own
pectoral
chain
these
all
reached
their
destination
in
good
condition
and
were
graciously
accepted
but
before
long
the
elamite
prince
threatened
in
his
own
domain
forgot
everything
except
his
own
personal
safety
and
declared
himself
unable
to
render
any
assistance
the
latter
on
receiving
this
news
threw
himself
with
his
face
in
the
dust
rent
his
clothes
and
broke
out
into
loud
weeping
after
which
conscious
that
his
strength
would
not
permit
of
his
meeting
the
enemy
in
the
open
field
he
withdrew
his
men
from
the
other
side
of
the
tigris
escaped
secretly
by
night
and
retired
with
his
troops
to
the
fortress
of
ikbîbel
the
inhabitants
of
babylon
and
borsippa
did
not
allow
themselves
to
be
disconcerted
they
brought
the
arks
of
bel
zarpanît
nebo
and
tashmît
out
of
their
sanctuaries
and
came
forth
with
chanting
and
musical
instruments
to
salute
sargon
at
he
entered
the
city
in
their
company
and
after
he
had
celebrated
the
customary
sacrifices
the
people
enthroned
him
in
palace
tribute
was
offered
to
him
but
he
refused
to
accept
any
part
of
it
for
his
personal
use
and
applied
it
to
a
work
of
public
utility
the
repairing
of
the
ancient
canal
of
borsippa
which
had
become
nearly
filled
up
this
done
he
detached
a
body
of
troops
to
occupy
sippara
and
returned
to
assyria
there
to
take
up
his
winter
quarters
once
again
therefore
the
ancient
metropolis
of
the
euphrates
was
ruled
by
an
assyrian
who
united
in
one
protocol
the
titles
of
the
sovereigns
of
assur
and
babylon
possessed
for
the
kings
of
nineveh
the
same
kind
of

monarchs
been
crowned

than
they
turned
their
eyes
towards
babylon
and
their
ambition
knew
no
rest
till
the
day
came
for
them
to
present
themselves
in
pomp
within
the
temple

god

implore
his
solemn
consecration

at

scrupulously
secured

returned
in

month
nisan

year

preside
over

procession
of

god

he
devoutly
accomplished
the
rites
which
constituted
him
the
legitimate
successor
of
the
heroes
of
the
old
empire
foremost
among
whom
was
his
namesake
shargâni
of

he
offered
sacrifices
to
bel

and
to
the
divinities
of
sumir
and
akkad
and
he
did
not
return
to
the
camp
until
he
had
fulfilled
all
the
duties
incumbent
on
his
new
dignity
he
was
involved
that
year
in
two
important
wars
at
opposite
points
of
his
empire
one
was
at
the
extremity
against
the
mushki
and
their
king
mita
who
after
having
supported
eusas
was
now
intriguing
with
argistis
the
other
in
the
against
the
kaldâ
and
probably
also
against
elam
he
entrusted
the
conduct
of
the
former
to
the
governor
of
kuî
but
reserved
to
himself
the
final
reckoning
with
the
babylonian
king
had
made
good
use
of
the
respite
given
him
during
the
winter
months
too
prudent
to
meet
his
enemy
in
the
open
plain
he
had
transformed
his
hereditary
principality
into
a
formidable
citadel
during
the
preceding
campaign
he
had
devastated
the
whole
of
the
country
lying
between
the
marshes
and
the
territory
occupied
by
the
assyrians
and
had
withdrawn
the
inhabitants
most
of
the
towns

and
were
also
deserted
and
no
garrisons
were
left

he
had
added

the
fortifications
of

enlarged
the
moat
till
it
was
two
hundred
cubits
wide
and
eighteen
deep
so
as
to
reach
the
level
of
infiltration
he
then
turned
into
it
the
waters
of
the
euphrates
so
that
the
town
appeared
to
be
floating
on
a
lake
without
either
bridges
or
quays
by
means
of
which
the
besiegers
might
have
brought
their

within

their
troops
been
able
to
approach

an
assault
had
been
careful
not
to
shut
himself
within

had
taken
up
a
position
in

there

pursued
the
fugitives
to
the
outer
side

seized
the

the

they
were
still
so
powerful
that
it
was

way

seven
of

were
so

alarmed
by
the

to

punishment
for
their
misdeeds
they
therefore
sent

presents
and
for
the

abandoned
their

the
homage
of

inveterate

raised
sargon
in
his
own
eyes
and
in
those
of
his
subjects

years
later
about
he
presented
them
with
a
stele

marble
on
which
he
had
engraved

still
found

for
works

peaceful
character

set
himself
to
remodel

complete

repaired

cleaned
out

made
good
the

the
canals
which
had
been
neglected
during
the
troublous
times
of
the
last
generation
he
erected
buildings
at
and
at
nineveh
but
in
these
cities
everything
seemed
to
recall
too
vividly
the
memory
of
the
sovereigns
who
had
gone
before
him
he
wished
for
a
capital
which
should
belong
to
himself

where
he
would
not
be
reminded
of
a
past
in

that

from

devoted
to
hastening
on
the
progress
of
the
work
and
whenever
he
gained
a
victory

pillaged
a
district
he
invariably
set
aside
a
considerable
part
of
the
booty
in

to
meet
the
outlay
which
the

involved
thus
we
find
that
on
returning
from
his
tenth
campaign
he
brought
with
him
an
immense
convoy
laden
with
timber

precious
metals

he
had
collected
in

years

worry

son
better
known
to
us
as
sennacherib

he

transferred
the
responsibility
of
keeping
watch
over
the
movements
of
the

barbarians
who
dwelt

at

promptly
suppressed

his
young

energetic
deputy

for

himself

was
content
to
retain
the
direct
control
of
the
more
pacific
provinces
such
as
babylon
the
regions
of
the
middle
euphrates
and
syria
and
he
doubtless
hoped
to
enjoy
during
his
later
years
such
tranquillity
as
was
necessary
to
enable
him
to
place
his
conquests
on
a
stable
basis

envious
fates
however
allowed
him
but
little
more
than
twelve
short
months

perished
early

some
soldier
of
alien
birth
if
i
interpret
rightly
the
mutilated
text
which
furnishes
us
with
a
brief
mention
of
the
disaster
sennacherib
was
recalled
in
haste
from
the
frontier
and
proclaimed
king
immediately
on
his
arrival
thus
ascending
unopposed
to
the
throne
on
the
day
of
ab
his
body
had
been
left
unburied
doubtless
in
order
that
he
might
verify
with
his
own
eyes
the
truth
of
what
had
been
told
him
concerning
his
death
and
thus
have
no
ground
for
harbouring
suspicions
that
would
have
boded
ill
for
the
safety
of
the
late
councillors
and
servants
he
looked
upon
his
miserable
ending
as
a
punishment
for
some
unknown
transgression
and
consulted
the
gods
to
learn
what
it
was
that
had
aroused
their
anger
refusing
to
authorise
the
burial
within
the
palace
until
the
various
expiatory
rites
suggested
by
the
oracle
had
been
duly
performed
this
is
my
interpretation
of
the
text
published
and
translated
by
winckler
winckler
sees
in
it
the
account
of
a
campaign
during
which
sargon
was
killed
by
mountaineers
as
was
cyprus
in
later
times
by
the
massagetse
the
body
according
to
him
remained
unburied
and
was
recovered
by
sennacherib
only
after
considerable
delay
in
support
of
his
version
of
this
event
winckler
cites
the
passage
in
isa
xiv
which
he
takes
as
having
been
composed
to
exult
over
the
death
of
sargon
and
then
afterwards
adapted
to
the
death
of
a
king
of
babylon
thus
mysteriously
disappeared
the
founder
of
the
mightiest
dynasty
that
ever
ruled
in
assyria
perhaps
even
in
the
whole
of
western
asia
at
first
sight
it
would
seem
easy
enough
to
determine
what
manner
of
man
he
was
and
to
what
qualities
he
owed
his
greatness
thanks
to
the
abundance
of
documents
which
his
contemporaries
have
bequeathed
to
us
but
when
we
come
to
examine
more
closely
we
soon
find
the
task
to
be
by
no
means
a
simple
one
the
inscriptions
maintain
so
discreet
a
silence
with
regard
to
the
antecedents
of
the
kings
before
their
accession
and
concerning
their
education
and
private
life
that
at
this
distance
of
time
we
can
not
succeed
in
forming
any
clear
idea
as
to
their
individual
temperament
and
character
the
monuments
record
such
achievements
as
they
took
pride
in
in
terms
of
uniform
praise
which
conceal
or
obliterate
the
personality
of
the
king
in
question
it
is
always
the
ideal
assyrian
sovereign
who
is
held
up
for
our
admiration
under
a
score
of
different
names
and
if
here
and
there
we
come
upon
some
trait
which
indicates
the
special
genius
of
this
or
that
monarch
we
may
be
sure
that
the
scribe
has
allowed
it
to
slip
in
by
accident
quite
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
he
is
thus
affording
us
a
glimpse
of
his
true
character
and
disposition
a
study
of
campaigns
as
revealed
in
his
annals
will
speedily
convince
us
that
he
was
something
more
than
a
fearless
general
with
a
keen
eye
to
plunder
who
could
see
nothing
in
the
most
successful
expedition
but
a
means
of
enriching
his
people
or
adding
to
the
splendours
of
his
court
he
was
evidently
convinced
that
certain
nations
such
as
urartu
and
elam
would
never
really
assimilate
with
his
own
subjects
and
in
their
case
he
adhered
strictly
to
the
old
system
of
warfare
and
did
all
he
could
to
bring
about
their
ruin
other
nations
on
the
contrary
he
regarded
as
capable
of
amalgamation
with
the
assyrians
and
these
he
did
his
best
to
protect
from
the
worst
consequences
of
their
rebellion
and
resistance
he
withdrew
them
from
the
influence
of
their
native
dynasties
and
converted
their
territories
into
provinces
under
his
own
vigilant
administration
and
though
he
did
not
scruple
to
send
the
more
turbulent
elements
among
them
into
exile
and
did
his
best
to
weaken
them
by
founding
alien
colonies
in
their
midst
yet
he
respected
their
religion
customs
and
laws
and
in
return
for
their
obedience
to
his
rule
guaranteed
them
an
equitable
and
judicious
government
moreover
he
took
quite
as
much
interest
in
their
in
his
own
military
successes
and
in
the
midst
of
his
heroic
struggles
against
rusas
and
he
contrived
to
find
time
for
the
consideration
of
such
prosaic
themes
as
the
cultivation
of
the
vine
and
of
corn
he
devoted
his
attention
to
the
best
methods
of
storing
wine

to
prevent

man
and
healeth
wounds
from

and

from

that
of
we
seem
to
see
in
him
not
only
the
stern
and
at
times
cruel
conqueror

also
the
gracious
monarch
kind
and

to
his
