the

spirit

the
future
of
democracy
is
america
i
have
never
managed
to
lose
my
old
conviction
that
travel
narrows
the
mind
at
least
a
man
must
make
a
double
effort
of
moral
humility
and
imaginative
energy
to
prevent
it
from
narrowing
his
mind
indeed
there
is
something
touching
and
even
tragic
about
the
thought
of
the
thoughtless
tourist
who
might
have
stayed
at
home
loving
laplanders
embracing
chinamen
and
clasping
patagonians
to
his
heart
in
hampstead
or
surbiton
but
for
his
blind
and
suicidal
impulse
to
go
and
see
what
they
looked
like
this
is
not
meant
for
nonsense
still
less
is
it
meant
for
the
silliest
sort
of
nonsense
which
is
cynicism
the
human
bond
that
he
feels
at
home
is
not
an
illusion
on
the
contrary
it
is
rather
an
inner
reality
man
is
inside
all
men
in
a
real
sense
any
man
may
be
inside
any
men
but
to
travel
is
to
leave
the
inside
and
draw
dangerously
near
the
outside
so
long
as
he
thought
of
men
in
the
abstract
like
naked
toiling
figures
in
some
classic
frieze
merely
as
those
who
labour
and
love
their
children
and
die
he
was
thinking
the
fundamental
truth
about
them
by
going
to
look
at
their
unfamiliar
manners
and
customs
he
is
inviting
them
to
disguise
themselves
in
fantastic
masks
and
costumes
many
modern
internationalists
talk
as
if
men
of
different
nationalities
had
only
to
meet
and
mix
and
understand
each
other
in
reality
that
is
the
moment
of
supreme
danger
the
moment
when
they
meet
we
might
shiver
as
at
the
old
euphemism
by
which
a
meeting
meant
a
duel
travel
ought
to
combine
amusement
with
instruction
but
most
travellers
are
so
much
amused
that
they
refuse
to
be
instructed
i
do
not
blame
them
for
being
amused
it
is
perfectly
natural
to
be
amused
at
a
dutchman
for
being
dutch
or
a
chinaman
for
being
chinese
where
they
are
wrong
is
that
they
take
their
own
amusement
seriously
they
base
on
it
their
serious
ideas
of
international
instruction
it
was
said
that
the
englishman
takes
his
pleasures
sadly
and
the
pleasure
of
despising
foreigners
is
one
which
he
takes
most
sadly
of
all
he
comes
to
scoff
and
does
not
remain
to
pray
but
rather
to
excommunicate
hence
in
international
relations
there
is
far
too
little
laughing
and
far
too
much
sneering
but
i
believe
that
there
is
a
better
way
which
largely
consists
of
laughter
a
form
of
friendship
between
nations
which
is
actually
founded
on
differences
to
hint
at
some
such
better
way
is
the
only
excuse
of
this
book
let
me
begin
my
american
impressions
with
two
impressions
i
had
before
i
went
to
america
one
was
an
incident
and
the
other
an
idea
and
when
taken
together
they
illustrate
the
attitude
i
mean
the
first
principle
is
that
nobody
should
be
ashamed
of
thinking
a
thing
funny
because
it
is
foreign
the
second
is
that
he
should
be
ashamed
of
thinking
it
wrong
because
it
is
funny
the
reaction
of
his
senses
and
superficial
habits
of
mind
against
something
new
and
to
him
abnormal
is
a
perfectly
healthy
reaction
but
the
mind
which
imagines
that
mere
unfamiliarity
can
possibly
prove
anything
about
inferiority
is
a
very
inadequate
mind
it
is
inadequate
even
in
criticising
things
that
may
really
be
inferior
to
the
things
involved
here
it
is
far
better
to
laugh
at
a
negro
for
having
a
black
face
than
to
sneer
at
him
for
having
a
sloping
skull
it
is
proportionally
even
more
preferable
to
laugh
rather
than
judge
in
dealing
with
highly
civilised
peoples
therefore
i
put
at
the
beginning
two
working
examples
of
what
i
felt
about
america
before
i
saw
it
the
sort
of
thing
that
a
man
has
a
right
to
enjoy
as
a
joke
and
the
sort
of
thing
he
has
a
duty
to
understand
and
respect
because
it
is
the
explanation
of
the
joke
when
i
went
to
the
american
consulate
to
regularise
my
passports
i
was
capable
of
expecting
the
american
consulate
to
be
american
embassies
and
consulates
are
by
tradition
like
islands
of
the
soil
for
which
they
stand
and
i
have
often
found
the
tradition
corresponding
to
a
truth
i
have
seen
the
unmistakable
french
official
living
on
omelettes
and
a
little
wine
and
serving
his
sacred
abstractions
under
the
last
fringing
a
desert
in
the
heat
and
noise
of
quarrelling
turks
and
egyptians
i
have
come
suddenly
as
with
the
cool
shock
of
his
own
on
the
listless
amiability
of
the
english
gentleman
the
officials
i
interviewed
were
very
american
especially
in
being
very
polite
for
whatever
may
have
been
the
mood
or
meaning
of
martin
chuzzlewit
i
have
always
found
americans
by
far
the
politest
people
in
the
world
they
put
in
my
hands
a
form
to
be
filled
up
to
all
appearance
like
other
forms
i
had
filled
up
in
other
passport
offices
but
in
reality
it
was
very
different
from
any
form
i
had
ever
filled
up
in
my
life
at
least
it
was
a
little
like
a
freer
form
of
the
game
called
which
my
friends
and
i
invented
in
our
youth
an
examination
paper
containing
questions
like
you
saw
a
rhinoceros
in
the
front
garden
what
would
you
do
one
of
my
friends
i
remember
wrote
the
pledge
but
that
is
another
story
and
might
bring
pussyfoot
johnson
on
the
scene
before
his
time
one
of
the
questions
on
the
paper
was
you
an
anarchist
to
which
a
detached
philosopher
would
naturally
feel
inclined
to
answer
the
devil
has
that
to
do
with
you
are
you
an
atheist
along
with
some
playful
efforts
to
the
official
about
what
constitutes
an
greek
archÃª
then
there
was
the
question
you
in
favour
of
subverting
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
against
this
i
should
write
prefer
to
answer
that
question
at
the
end
of
my
tour
and
not
the
beginning
the
inquisitor
in
his
more
than
morbid
curiosity
had
then
written
down
you
a
polygamist
the
answer
to
this
is
such
luck
or
such
a
fool
according
to
our
experience
of
the
other
sex
but
perhaps
a
better
answer
would
be
that
given
to
stead
when
he
circulated
the
rhetorical
question
i
slay
my
brother
boer
the
answer
that
ran
interfere
in
family
matters
but
among
many
things
that
amused
me
almost
to
the
point
of
treating
the
form
thus
disrespectfully
the
most
amusing
was
the
thought
of
the
ruthless
outlaw
who
should
feel
compelled
to
treat
it
respectfully
i
like
to
think
of
the
foreign
desperado
seeking
to
slip
into
america
with
official
papers
under
official
protection
and
sitting
down
to
write
with
a
beautiful
gravity
am
an
anarchist
i
hate
you
all
and
wish
to
destroy
you
or
intend
to
subvert
by
force
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
soon
as
possible
sticking
the
long
in
my
left
into
harding
at
the
earliest
opportunity
or
again
i
am
a
polygamist
all
right
and
my
wives
are
accompanying
me
on
the
voyage
disguised
as
secretaries
there
seems
to
be
a
certain
simplicity
of
mind
about
these
answers
and
it
is
reassuring
to
know
that
anarchists
and
polygamists
are
so
pure
and
good
that
the
police
have
only
to
ask
them
questions
and
they
are
certain
to
tell
no
lies
now
that
is
a
model
of
the
sort
of
foreign
practice
founded
on
foreign
problems
at
which
a
man
first
impulse
is
naturally
to
laugh
nor
have
i
any
intention
of
apologising
for
my
laughter
a
man
is
perfectly
entitled
to
laugh
at
a
thing
because
he
happens
to
find
it
incomprehensible
what
he
has
no
right
to
do
is
to
laugh
at
it
as
incomprehensible
and
then
criticise
it
as
if
he
comprehended
it
the
very
fact
of
its
unfamiliarity
and
mystery
ought
to
set
him
thinking
about
the
deeper
causes
that
make
people
so
different
from
himself
and
that
without
merely
assuming
that
they
must
be
inferior
to
himself
superficially
this
is
rather
a
queer
business
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
suggest
that
in
this
america
has
introduced
a
quite
abnormal
spirit
of
inquisition
an
interference
with
liberty
unknown
among
all
the
ancient
despotisms
and
aristocracies
about
that
there
will
be
something
to
be
said
later
but
superficially
it
is
true
that
this
degree
of
officialism
is
comparatively
unique
in
a
journey
which
i
took
only
the
year
before
i
had
occasion
to
have
my
papers
passed
by
governments
which
many
worthy
people
in
the
west
would
vaguely
identify
with
corsairs
and
assassins
i
have
stood
on
the
other
side
of
jordan
in
the
land
ruled
by
a
rude
arab
chief
where
the
police
looked
so
like
brigands
that
one
wondered
what
the
brigands
looked
like
but
they
did
not
ask
me
whether
i
had
come
to
subvert
the
power
of
the
shereef
and
they
did
not
exhibit
the
faintest
curiosity
about
my
personal
views
on
the
ethical
basis
of
civil
authority
these
ministers
of
ancient
moslem
despotism
did
not
care
about
whether
i
was
an
anarchist
and
naturally
would
not
have
minded
if
i
had
been
a
polygamist
the
arab
chief
was
probably
a
polygamist
himself
these
slaves
of
asiatic
autocracy
were
content
in
the
old
liberal
fashion
to
judge
me
by
my
actions
they
did
not
inquire
into
my
thoughts
they
held
their
power
as
limited
to
the
limitation
of
practice
they
did
not
forbid
me
to
hold
a
theory
it
would
be
easy
to
argue
here
that
western
democracy
persecutes
where
even
eastern
despotism
tolerates
or
emancipates
it
would
be
easy
to
develop
the
fancy
that
as
compared
with
the
sultans
of
turkey
or
egypt
the
american
constitution
is
a
thing
like
the
spanish
inquisition
only
the
traveller
who
stops
at
that
point
is
totally
wrong
and
the
traveller
only
too
often
does
stop
at
that
point
he
has
found
something
to
make
him
laugh
and
he
will
not
suffer
it
to
make
him
think
and
the
remedy
is
not
to
unsay
what
he
has
said
not
even
so
to
speak
to
unlaugh
what
he
has
laughed
not
to
deny
that
there
is
something
unique
and
curious
about
this
american
inquisition
into
our
abstract
opinions
but
rather
to
continue
the
train
of
thought
and
follow
the
admirable
advice
of
wells
who
said
is
not
much
good
thinking
of
a
thing
unless
you
think
it
out
it
is
not
to
deny
that
american
officialism
is
rather
peculiar
on
this
point
but
to
inquire
what
it
really
is
which
makes
america
peculiar
or
which
is
peculiar
to
america
in
short
it
is
to
get
some
ultimate
idea
of
what
america
and
the
answer
to
that
question
will
reveal
something
much
deeper
and
grander
and
more
worthy
of
our
intelligent
interest
it
may
have
seemed
something
less
than
a
compliment
to
compare
the
american
constitution
to
the
spanish
inquisition
but
oddly
enough
it
does
involve
a
truth
and
still
more
oddly
perhaps
it
does
involve
a
compliment
the
american
constitution
does
resemble
the
spanish
inquisition
in
this
that
it
is
founded
on
a
creed
america
is
the
only
nation
in
the
world
that
is
founded
on
a
creed
that
creed
is
set
forth
with
dogmatic
and
even
theological
lucidity
in
the
declaration
of
independence
perhaps
the
only
piece
of
practical
politics
that
is
also
theoretical
politics
and
also
great
literature
it
enunciates
that
all
men
are
equal
in
their
claim
to
justice
that
governments
exist
to
give
them
that
justice
and
that
their
authority
is
for
that
reason
just
it
certainly
does
condemn
anarchism
and
it
does
also
by
inference
condemn
atheism
since
it
clearly
names
the
creator
as
the
ultimate
authority
from
whom
these
equal
rights
are
derived
nobody
expects
a
modern
political
system
to
proceed
logically
in
the
application
of
such
dogmas
and
in
the
matter
of
god
and
government
it
is
naturally
god
whose
claim
is
taken
more
lightly
the
point
is
that
there
is
a
creed
if
not
about
divine
at
least
about
human
things
now
a
creed
is
at
once
the
broadest
and
the
narrowest
thing
in
the
world
in
its
nature
it
is
as
broad
as
its
scheme
for
a
brotherhood
of
all
men
in
its
nature
it
is
limited
by
its
definition
of
the
nature
of
all
men
this
was
true
of
the
christian
church
which
was
truly
said
to
exclude
neither
jew
nor
greek
but
which
did
definitely
substitute
something
else
for
jewish
religion
or
greek
philosophy
it
was
truly
said
to
be
a
net
drawing
in
of
all
kinds
but
a
net
of
a
certain
pattern
the
pattern
of
peter
the
fisherman
and
this
is
true
even
of
the
most
disastrous
distortions
or
degradations
of
that
creed
and
true
among
others
of
the
spanish
inquisition
it
may
have
been
narrow
touching
theology
it
could
not
confess
to
being
narrow
about
nationality
or
ethnology
the
spanish
inquisition
might
be
admittedly
inquisitorial
but
the
spanish
inquisition
could
not
be
merely
spanish
such
a
spaniard
even
when
he
was
narrower
than
his
own
creed
had
to
be
broader
than
his
own
empire
he
might
burn
a
philosopher
because
he
was
heterodox
but
he
must
accept
a
barbarian
because
he
was
orthodox
and
we
see
even
in
modern
times
that
the
same
church
which
is
blamed
for
making
sages
heretics
is
also
blamed
for
making
savages
priests
now
in
a
much
vaguer
and
more
evolutionary
fashion
there
is
something
of
the
same
idea
at
the
back
of
the
great
american
experiment
the
experiment
of
a
democracy
of
diverse
races
which
has
been
compared
to
a
but
even
that
metaphor
implies
that
the
pot
itself
is
of
a
certain
shape
and
a
certain
substance
a
pretty
solid
substance
the
must
not
melt
the
original
shape
was
traced
on
the
lines
of
jeffersonian
democracy
and
it
will
remain
in
that
shape
until
it
becomes
shapeless
america
invites
all
men
to
become
citizens
but
it
implies
the
dogma
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
citizenship
only
so
far
as
its
primary
ideal
is
concerned
its
exclusiveness
is
religious
because
it
is
not
racial
the
missionary
can
condemn
a
cannibal
precisely
because
he
can
not
condemn
a
sandwich
islander
and
in
something
of
the
same
spirit
the
american
may
exclude
a
polygamist
precisely
because
he
can
not
exclude
a
turk
now
for
america
this
is
no
idle
theory
it
may
have
been
theoretical
though
it
was
thoroughly
sincere
when
that
great
virginian
gentleman
declared
it
in
surroundings
that
still
had
something
of
the
character
of
an
english
countryside
it
is
not
merely
theoretical
now
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
america
being
literally
invaded
by
turks
as
she
is
invaded
by
jews
or
bulgars
in
the
most
exquisitely
inconsequent
of
the
we
are
told
concerning
pasha
bailey
ben
one
morning
knocked
at
eight
a
tall
red
indian
at
his
gate
in
turkey
as
you
aware
red
indians
are
extremely
rare
but
the
converse
need
by
no
means
be
true
there
is
nothing
in
the
nature
of
things
to
prevent
an
emigration
of
turks
increasing
and
multiplying
on
the
plains
where
the
red
indians
wandered
there
is
nothing
to
necessitate
the
turks
being
extremely
rare
the
red
indians
alas
are
likely
to
be
rarer
and
as
i
much
prefer
red
indians
to
turks
not
to
mention
jews
i
speak
without
prejudice
but
the
point
here
is
that
america
partly
by
original
theory
and
partly
by
historical
accident
does
lie
open
to
racial
admixtures
which
most
countries
would
think
incongruous
or
comic
that
is
why
it
is
only
fair
to
read
any
american
definitions
or
rules
in
a
certain
light
and
relatively
to
a
rather
unique
position
it
is
not
fair
to
compare
the
position
of
those
who
may
meet
turks
in
the
back
street
with
that
of
those
who
have
never
met
turks
except
in
the
it
is
not
fair
simply
to
compare
america
with
england
in
its
regulations
about
the
turk
in
short
it
is
not
fair
to
do
what
almost
every
englishman
probably
does
to
look
at
the
american
international
examination
paper
and
laugh
and
be
satisfied
with
saying
do
have
any
of
that
nonsense
in
england
we
do
not
have
any
of
that
nonsense
in
england
because
we
have
never
attempted
to
have
any
of
that
philosophy
in
england
and
above
all
because
we
have
the
enormous
advantage
of
feeling
it
natural
to
be
national
because
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
england
in
these
days
is
not
well
governed
england
is
not
well
educated
england
suffers
from
wealth
and
poverty
that
are
not
well
distributed
but
england
is
english
england
is
english
as
france
is
french
or
ireland
irish
the
great
mass
of
men
taking
certain
national
traditions
for
granted
now
this
gives
us
a
totally
different
and
a
very
much
easier
task
we
have
not
got
an
inquisition
because
we
have
not
got
a
creed
but
it
is
arguable
that
we
do
not
need
a
creed
because
we
have
got
a
character
in
any
of
the
old
nations
the
national
unity
is
preserved
by
the
national
type
because
we
have
a
type
we
do
not
need
to
have
a
test
take
that
innocent
question
you
an
anarchist
which
is
intrinsically
quite
as
impudent
as
you
an
optimist
or
you
a
philanthropist
i
am
not
discussing
here
whether
these
things
are
right
but
whether
most
of
us
are
in
a
position
to
know
them
rightly
now
it
is
quite
true
that
most
englishmen
do
not
find
it
necessary
to
go
about
all
day
asking
each
other
whether
they
are
anarchists
it
is
quite
true
that
the
phrase
occurs
on
no
british
forms
that
i
have
seen
but
this
is
not
only
because
most
of
the
englishmen
are
not
anarchists
it
is
even
more
because
even
the
anarchists
are
englishmen
for
instance
it
would
be
easy
to
make
fun
of
the
american
formula
by
noting
that
the
cap
would
fit
all
sorts
of
bald
academic
heads
it
might
well
be
maintained
that
herbert
spencer
was
an
anarchist
it
is
practically
certain
that
auberon
herbert
was
an
anarchist
but
herbert
spencer
was
an
extraordinarily
typical
englishman
of
the
nonconformist
middle
class
and
auberon
herbert
was
an
extraordinarily
typical
english
aristocrat
of
the
old
and
genuine
aristocracy
every
one
knew
in
his
heart
that
the
squire
would
not
throw
a
bomb
at
the
queen
and
the
nonconformist
would
not
throw
a
bomb
at
anybody
every
one
knew
that
there
was
something
subconscious
in
a
man
like
auberon
herbert
which
would
have
come
out
only
in
throwing
bombs
at
the
enemies
of
england
as
it
did
come
out
in
his
son
and
namesake
the
generous
and
unforgotten
who
fell
flinging
bombs
from
the
sky
far
beyond
the
german
line
every
one
knows
that
normally
in
the
last
resort
the
english
gentleman
is
patriotic
every
one
knows
that
the
english
nonconformist
is
national
even
when
he
denies
that
he
is
patriotic
nothing
is
more
notable
indeed
than
the
fact
that
nobody
is
more
stamped
with
the
mark
of
his
own
nation
than
the
man
who
says
that
there
ought
to
be
no
nations
somebody
called
cobden
the
international
man
but
no
man
could
be
more
english
than
cobden
everybody
recognises
tolstoy
as
the
iconoclast
of
all
patriotism
but
nobody
could
be
more
russian
than
tolstoy
in
the
old
countries
where
there
are
these
national
types
the
types
may
be
allowed
to
hold
any
theories
even
if
they
hold
certain
theories
they
are
unlikely
to
do
certain
things
so
the
conscientious
objector
in
the
english
sense
may
be
and
is
one
of
the
peculiar
of
england
but
the
conscientious
objector
will
probably
have
a
conscientious
objection
to
throwing
bombs
now
i
am
very
far
from
intending
to
imply
that
these
american
tests
are
good
tests
or
that
there
is
no
danger
of
tyranny
becoming
the
temptation
of
america
i
shall
have
something
to
say
later
on
about
that
temptation
or
tendency
nor
do
i
say
that
they
apply
consistently
this
conception
of
a
nation
with
the
soul
of
a
church
protected
by
religious
and
not
racial
selection
if
they
did
apply
that
principle
consistently
they
would
have
to
exclude
pessimists
and
rich
cynics
who
deny
the
democratic
ideal
an
excellent
thing
but
a
rather
improbable
one
what
i
say
is
that
when
we
realise
that
this
principle
exists
at
all
we
see
the
whole
position
in
a
totally
different
perspective
we
say
that
the
americans
are
doing
something
heroic
or
doing
something
insane
or
doing
it
in
an
unworkable
or
unworthy
fashion
instead
of
simply
wondering
what
the
devil
they
are
doing
when
we
realise
the
democratic
design
of
such
a
cosmopolitan
commonwealth
and
compare
it
with
our
insular
reliance
or
instincts
we
see
at
once
why
such
a
thing
has
to
be
not
only
democratic
but
dogmatic
we
see
why
in
some
points
it
tends
to
be
inquisitive
or
intolerant
any
one
can
see
the
practical
point
by
merely
transferring
into
private
life
a
problem
like
that
of
the
two
academic
anarchists
who
might
by
a
coincidence
be
called
the
two
herberts
suppose
a
man
said
my
old
oxford
tutor
wants
to
meet
you
i
wish
you
ask
him
down
for
a
day
or
two
he
has
the
oddest
opinions
but
he
very
stimulating
it
would
not
occur
to
us
that
the
oddity
of
the
oxford
don
opinions
would
lead
him
to
blow
up
the
house
because
the
oxford
don
is
an
english
type
suppose
somebody
said
let
me
bring
old
colonel
robinson
down
for
the
he
a
bit
of
a
crank
but
quite
interesting
we
should
not
anticipate
the
colonel
running
amuck
with
a
and
offering
up
human
sacrifice
in
the
garden
for
these
are
not
among
the
daily
habits
of
an
old
english
colonel
and
because
we
know
his
habits
we
do
not
care
about
his
opinions
but
suppose
somebody
offered
to
bring
a
person
from
the
interior
of
kamskatka
to
stay
with
us
for
a
week
or
two
and
added
that
his
religion
was
a
very
extraordinary
religion
we
should
feel
a
little
more
inquisitive
about
what
kind
of
religion
it
was
if
somebody
wished
to
add
a
hairy
ainu
to
the
family
party
at
christmas
explaining
that
his
point
of
view
was
so
individual
and
interesting
we
should
want
to
know
a
little
more
about
it
and
him
we
should
be
tempted
to
draw
up
as
fantastic
an
examination
paper
as
that
presented
to
the
emigrant
going
to
america
we
should
ask
what
a
hairy
ainu
was
and
how
hairy
he
was
and
above
all
what
sort
of
ainu
he
was
would
etiquette
require
us
to
ask
him
to
bring
his
wife
and
if
we
did
ask
him
to
bring
his
wife
how
many
wives
would
he
bring
in
short
as
in
the
american
formula
is
he
a
polygamist
merely
as
a
point
of
housekeeping
and
accommodation
the
question
is
not
irrelevant
is
the
hairy
ainu
content
with
hair
or
does
he
wear
any
clothes
if
the
police
insist
on
his
wearing
clothes
will
he
recognise
the
authority
of
the
police
in
short
as
in
the
american
formula
is
he
an
anarchist
of
course
this
generalisation
about
america
like
other
historical
things
is
subject
to
all
sorts
of
cross
divisions
and
exceptions
to
be
considered
in
their
place
the
negroes
are
a
special
problem
because
of
what
white
men
in
the
past
did
to
them
the
japanese
are
a
special
problem
because
of
what
men
fear
that
they
in
the
future
may
do
to
white
men
the
jews
are
a
special
problem
because
of
what
they
and
the
gentiles
in
the
past
present
and
future
seem
to
have
the
habit
of
doing
to
each
other
but
the
point
is
not
that
nothing
exists
in
america
except
this
idea
it
is
that
nothing
like
this
idea
exists
anywhere
except
in
america
this
idea
is
not
internationalism
on
the
contrary
it
is
decidedly
nationalism
the
americans
are
very
patriotic
and
wish
to
make
their
new
citizens
patriotic
americans
but
it
is
the
idea
of
making
a
new
nation
literally
out
of
any
old
nation
that
comes
along
in
a
word
what
is
unique
is
not
america
but
what
is
called
americanisation
we
understand
nothing
till
we
understand
the
amazing
ambition
to
americanise
the
kamskatkan
and
the
hairy
ainu
we
are
not
trying
to
anglicise
thousands
of
french
cooks
or
italian
france
is
not
trying
to
gallicise
thousands
of
english
trippers
or
german
prisoners
of
war
america
is
the
one
place
in
the
world
where
this
process
healthy
or
unhealthy
possible
or
impossible
is
going
on
and
the
process
as
i
have
pointed
out
is
internationalisation
it
would
be
truer
to
say
it
is
the
nationalisation
of
the
internationalised
it
is
making
a
home
out
of
vagabonds
and
a
nation
out
of
exiles
this
is
what
at
once
illuminates
and
softens
the
moral
regulations
which
we
may
really
think
faddist
or
fanatical
they
are
abnormal
but
in
one
sense
this
experiment
of
a
home
for
the
homeless
is
abnormal
in
short
it
has
long
been
recognised
that
america
was
an
asylum
it
is
only
since
prohibition
that
it
has
looked
a
little
like
a
lunatic
asylum
it
was
before
sailing
for
america
as
i
have
said
that
i
stood
with
the
official
paper
in
my
hand
and
these
thoughts
in
my
head
it
was
while
i
stood
on
english
soil
that
i
passed
through
the
two
stages
of
smiling
and
then
sympathising
of
realising
that
my
momentary
amusement
at
being
asked
if
i
were
not
an
anarchist
was
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
i
was
not
an
american
and
in
truth
i
think
there
are
some
things
a
man
ought
to
know
about
america
before
he
sees
it
what
we
know
of
a
country
beforehand
may
not
affect
what
we
see
that
it
is
but
it
will
vitally
affect
what
we
appreciate
it
for
being
because
it
will
vitally
affect
what
we
expect
it
to
be
i
can
honestly
say
that
i
had
never
expected
america
to
be
what
of
the
newspaper
critics
invariably
assume
it
to
be
i
never
thought
it
was
a
sort
of
colony
knowing
that
it
was
more
and
more
thronged
with
crowds
of
very
different
colonists
during
the
war
i
felt
that
the
very
worst
propaganda
for
the
allies
was
the
propaganda
for
the
i
tried
to
point
out
that
in
one
way
america
is
nearer
to
europe
than
england
is
if
she
is
not
nearer
to
bulgaria
she
is
nearer
to
bulgars
if
she
is
not
nearer
to
bohemia
she
is
nearer
to
bohemians
in
my
new
york
hotel
the
head
waiter
in
the
was
a
bohemian
the
head
waiter
in
the
was
a
bulgar
americans
have
nationalities
at
the
end
of
the
street
which
for
us
are
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
i
did
my
best
to
persuade
my
countrymen
not
to
appeal
to
the
american
as
if
he
were
a
rather
dowdy
englishman
who
had
been
rusticating
in
the
provinces
and
had
not
heard
the
latest
news
about
the
town
i
shall
record
later
some
of
those
arresting
realities
which
the
traveller
does
not
expect
and
which
in
some
cases
i
fear
he
actually
does
not
see
because
he
does
not
expect
i
shall
try
to
do
justice
to
the
psychology
of
what
belloc
has
called
in
travel
but
there
are
some
things
about
america
that
a
man
ought
to
see
even
with
his
eyes
shut
one
is
that
a
state
that
came
into
existence
solely
through
its
repudiation
and
abhorrence
of
the
british
crown
is
not
likely
to
be
a
respectful
copy
of
the
british
constitution
another
is
that
the
chief
mark
of
the
declaration
of
independence
is
something
that
is
not
only
absent
from
the
british
constitution
but
something
which
all
our
constitutionalists
have
invariably
thanked
god
with
the
jolliest
boasting
and
bragging
that
they
had
kept
out
of
the
british
constitution
it
is
the
thing
called
abstraction
or
academic
logic
it
is
the
thing
which
such
jolly
people
call
theory
and
which
those
who
can
practise
it
call
thought
and
the
theory
or
thought
is
the
very
last
to
which
english
people
are
accustomed
either
by
their
social
structure
or
their
traditional
teaching
it
is
the
theory
of
equality
it
is
the
pure
classic
conception
that
no
man
must
aspire
to
be
anything
more
than
a
citizen
and
that
no
man
should
endure
to
be
anything
less
it
is
by
no
means
especially
intelligible
to
an
englishman
who
tends
at
his
best
to
the
virtues
of
the
gentleman
and
at
his
worst
to
the
vices
of
the
snob
the
idealism
of
england
or
if
you
will
the
romance
of
england
has
not
been
primarily
the
romance
of
the
citizen
but
the
idealism
of
america
we
may
safely
say
still
revolves
entirely
round
the
citizen
and
his
romance
the
realities
are
quite
another
matter
and
we
shall
consider
in
its
place
the
question
of
whether
the
ideal
will
be
able
to
shape
the
realities
or
will
merely
be
beaten
shapeless
by
them
the
ideal
is
besieged
by
inequalities
of
the
most
towering
and
insane
description
in
the
industrial
and
economic
field
it
may
be
devoured
by
modern
capitalism
perhaps
the
worst
inequality
that
ever
existed
among
men
of
all
that
we
shall
speak
later
but
citizenship
is
still
the
american
ideal
there
is
an
army
of
actualities
opposed
to
that
ideal
but
there
is
no
ideal
opposed
to
that
ideal
american
plutocracy
has
never
got
itself
respected
like
english
aristocracy
citizenship
is
the
american
ideal
and
it
has
never
been
the
english
ideal
but
it
is
surely
an
ideal
that
may
stir
some
imaginative
generosity
and
respect
in
an
englishman
if
he
will
condescend
to
be
also
a
man
in
this
vision
of
moulding
many
peoples
into
the
visible
image
of
the
citizen
he
may
see
a
spiritual
adventure
which
he
can
admire
from
the
outside
at
least
as
much
as
he
admires
the
valour
of
the
moslems
and
much
more
than
he
admires
the
virtues
of
the
middle
ages
he
need
not
set
himself
to
develop
equality
but
he
need
not
set
himself
to
misunderstand
it
he
may
at
least
understand
what
jefferson
and
lincoln
meant
and
he
may
possibly
find
some
assistance
in
this
task
by
reading
what
they
said
he
may
realise
that
equality
is
not
some
crude
fairy
tale
about
all
men
being
equally
tall
or
equally
tricky
which
we
not
only
can
not
believe
but
can
not
believe
in
anybody
believing
it
is
an
absolute
of
morals
by
which
all
men
have
a
value
invariable
and
indestructible
and
a
dignity
as
intangible
as
death
he
may
at
least
be
a
philosopher
and
see
that
equality
is
an
idea
and
not
merely
one
of
these
sceptics
who
having
risen
by
low
tricks
to
high
places
drink
bad
champagne
in
tawdry
hotel
lounges
and
tell
each
other
twenty
times
over
with
unwearied
iteration
that
equality
is
an
illusion
in
truth
it
is
inequality
that
is
the
illusion
the
extreme
disproportion
between
men
that
we
seem
to
see
in
life
is
a
thing
of
changing
lights
and
lengthening
shadows
a
twilight
full
of
fancies
and
distortions
we
find
a
man
famous
and
can
not
live
long
enough
to
find
him
forgotten
we
see
a
race
dominant
and
can
not
linger
to
see
it
decay
it
is
the
experience
of
men
that
always
returns
to
the
equality
of
men
it
is
the
average
that
ultimately
justifies
the
average
man
it
is
when
men
have
seen
and
suffered
much
and
come
at
the
end
of
more
elaborate
experiments
that
they
see
men
as
men
under
an
equal
light
of
death
and
daily
laughter
and
none
the
less
mysterious
for
being
many
nor
is
it
in
vain
that
these
western
democrats
have
sought
the
blazonry
of
their
flag
in
that
great
multitude
of
immortal
lights
that
endure
behind
the
fires
we
see
and
gathered
them
into
the
corner
of
old
glory
whose
ground
is
like
the
glittering
night
for
veritably
in
the
spirit
as
well
as
in
the
symbol
suns
and
moons
and
meteors
pass
and
fill
our
skies
with
a
fleeting
and
almost
theatrical
conflagration
and
wherever
the
old
shadow
stoops
upon
the
earth
the
stars
return
meditation
in
a
new
york
all
this
must
begin
with
an
apology
and
not
an
apologia
when
i
went
wandering
about
the
states
disguised
as
a
lecturer
i
was
well
aware
that
i
was
not
sufficiently
well
disguised
to
be
a
spy
i
was
even
in
the
worst
possible
position
to
be
a
a
lecturer
to
american
audiences
can
hardly
be
in
the
holiday
mood
of
a
it
is
rather
the
audience
that
is
even
if
it
is
seeing
a
rather
melancholy
sight
some
say
that
people
come
to
see
the
lecturer
and
not
to
hear
him
in
which
case
it
seems
rather
a
pity
that
he
should
disturb
and
distress
their
minds
with
a
lecture
he
might
merely
display
himself
on
a
stand
or
platform
for
a
stipulated
sum
or
be
exhibited
like
a
monster
in
a
menagerie
the
circus
elephant
is
not
expected
to
make
a
speech
but
it
is
equally
true
that
the
circus
elephant
is
not
allowed
to
write
a
book
his
impressions
of
travel
would
be
somewhat
sketchy
and
perhaps
a
little
in
merely
travelling
from
circus
to
circus
he
would
so
to
speak
move
in
rather
narrow
circles
jumbo
the
great
elephant
with
whom
i
am
hardly
so
ambitious
as
to
compare
myself
before
he
eventually
went
to
the
barnum
show
passed
a
considerable
and
i
trust
happy
part
of
his
life
in
regent
park
but
if
he
had
written
a
book
on
england
founded
on
his
impressions
of
the
zoo
it
might
have
been
a
little
disproportionate
and
even
misleading
in
its
version
of
the
flora
and
fauna
of
that
country
he
might
imagine
that
lions
and
leopards
were
commoner
than
they
are
in
our
hedgerows
and
country
lanes
or
that
the
head
and
neck
of
a
giraffe
was
as
native
to
our
landscapes
as
a
village
spire
and
that
is
why
i
apologise
in
anticipation
for
a
probable
lack
of
proportion
in
this
work
like
the
elephant
i
may
have
seen
too
much
of
a
special
enclosure
where
a
special
sort
of
lions
are
gathered
together
i
may
exaggerate
the
territorial
as
distinct
from
the
vertical
space
occupied
by
the
spiritual
giraffe
for
the
giraffe
may
surely
be
regarded
as
an
example
of
uplift
and
is
even
in
a
manner
of
speaking
a
above
all
i
shall
probably
make
generalisations
that
are
much
too
general
and
are
insufficient
through
being
exaggerative
to
this
sort
of
doubt
all
my
impressions
are
subject
and
among
them
the
negative
generalisation
with
which
i
shall
begin
this
rambling
meditation
on
american
hotels
in
all
my
american
wanderings
i
never
saw
such
a
thing
as
an
inn
they
may
exist
but
they
do
not
arrest
the
traveller
upon
every
road
as
they
do
in
england
and
in
europe
the
saloons
no
longer
existed
when
i
was
there
owing
to
the
recent
reform
which
restricted
intoxicants
to
the
wealthier
classes
but
we
feel
that
the
saloons
have
been
there
if
one
may
so
express
it
their
absence
is
still
present
they
remain
in
the
structure
of
the
street
and
the
idiom
of
the
language
but
the
saloons
were
not
inns
if
they
had
been
inns
it
would
have
been
far
harder
even
for
the
power
of
modern
plutocracy
to
root
them
out
there
will
be
a
very
different
chase
when
the
white
hart
is
hunted
to
the
forests
or
when
the
red
lion
turns
to
bay
but
people
could
not
feel
about
the
american
saloon
as
they
will
feel
about
the
english
inns
they
could
not
feel
that
the
prohibitionist
that
vulgar
was
chucking
chaucer
out
of
the
tabard
and
shakespeare
out
of
the
mermaid
in
justice
to
the
american
prohibitionists
it
must
be
realised
that
they
were
not
doing
quite
such
desecration
and
that
many
of
them
felt
the
saloon
a
specially
poisonous
sort
of
place
they
did
feel
that
were
used
only
as
so
they
have
effected
the
great
reconstruction
by
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
use
only
as
but
i
am
not
dealing
here
with
the
problem
of
prohibition
except
in
so
far
as
it
is
involved
in
the
statement
that
the
saloons
were
in
no
sense
inns
secondly
of
course
there
are
the
hotels
there
are
indeed
there
are
hotels
toppling
to
the
stars
hotels
covering
the
acreage
of
villages
hotels
in
multitudinous
number
like
a
mob
of
babylonian
or
assyrian
monuments
but
the
hotels
also
are
not
inns
broadly
speaking
there
is
only
one
hotel
in
america
the
pattern
of
it
which
is
a
very
rational
pattern
is
repeated
in
cities
as
remote
from
each
other
as
the
capitals
of
european
empires
you
may
find
that
hotel
rising
among
the
red
blooms
of
the
warm
spring
woods
of
nebraska
or
whitened
with
canadian
snows
near
the
eternal
noise
of
niagara
and
before
touching
on
this
solid
and
simple
pattern
itself
i
may
remark
that
the
same
system
of
symmetry
runs
through
all
the
details
of
the
interior
as
one
hotel
is
like
another
hotel
so
one
hotel
floor
is
like
another
hotel
floor
if
the
passage
outside
your
bedroom
door
or
hallway
as
it
is
called
contains
let
us
say
a
small
table
with
a
green
vase
and
a
stuffed
flamingo
or
some
trifle
of
the
sort
you
may
be
perfectly
certain
that
there
is
exactly
the
same
table
vase
and
flamingo
on
every
one
of
the
landings
of
that
towering
habitation
this
is
where
it
differs
most
perhaps
from
the
crooked
landings
and
unexpected
levels
of
the
old
english
inns
even
when
they
call
themselves
hotels
to
me
there
was
something
weird
like
a
magic
multiplication
in
the
exquisite
sameness
of
these
suites
it
seemed
to
suggest
the
still
atmosphere
of
some
eerie
psychological
story
i
once
myself
entertained
the
notion
of
a
story
in
which
a
man
was
to
be
prevented
from
entering
his
house
the
scene
of
some
crime
or
calamity
by
people
who
painted
and
furnished
the
next
house
to
look
exactly
like
it
the
assimilation
going
to
the
most
fantastic
lengths
such
as
altering
the
numbering
of
houses
in
the
street
i
came
to
america
and
found
an
hotel
fitted
and
upholstered
throughout
for
the
enactment
of
my
phantasmal
fraud
i
offer
the
skeleton
of
my
story
with
all
humility
to
some
of
the
admirable
lady
writers
of
detective
stories
in
america
to
miss
carolyn
wells
or
miss
mary
roberts
rhinehart
or
green
of
the
unforgotten
leavenworth
case
surely
it
might
be
possible
for
the
unsophisticated
nimrod
moose
of
yellow
dog
flat
to
come
to
new
york
and
be
entangled
somehow
in
this
net
of
repetitions
or
recurrences
surely
something
tells
me
that
his
beautiful
daughter
the
rose
of
red
murder
gulch
might
seek
for
him
in
vain
amid
the
apparently
unmistakable
surroundings
of
the
floor
while
he
was
being
quietly
butchered
by
the
on
the
floor
an
agent
of
the
green
claw
that
formidable
organisation
and
all
because
the
two
floors
looked
exactly
alike
to
the
virginal
western
eye
the
original
point
of
my
own
story
was
that
the
man
to
be
entrapped
walked
into
his
own
house
after
all
in
spite
of
it
being
differently
painted
and
numbered
simply
because
he
was
and
used
to
taking
a
certain
number
of
mechanical
steps
this
would
not
work
in
the
hotel
because
a
lift
has
no
habits
it
is
typical
of
the
real
tameness
of
machinery
that
even
when
we
talk
of
a
man
turning
mechanically
we
only
talk
metaphorically
for
it
is
something
that
a
mechanism
can
not
do
but
i
think
there
is
only
one
real
objection
to
my
story
of
moose
in
the
new
york
hotel
and
that
is
unfortunately
a
rather
fatal
one
it
is
that
far
away
in
the
remote
desolation
of
yellow
dog
among
those
outlying
and
outlandish
rocks
that
almost
seem
to
rise
beyond
the
sunset
there
is
undoubtedly
an
hotel
of
exactly
the
same
sort
with
all
its
floors
exactly
the
same
anyhow
the
general
plan
of
the
american
hotel
is
commonly
the
same
and
as
i
have
said
it
is
a
very
sound
one
so
far
as
it
goes
when
i
first
went
into
one
of
the
big
new
york
hotels
the
first
impression
was
certainly
its
bigness
it
was
called
the
biltmore
and
i
wondered
how
many
national
humorists
had
made
the
obvious
comment
of
wishing
they
had
built
less
but
it
was
not
merely
the
babylonian
size
and
scale
of
such
things
it
was
the
way
in
which
they
are
used
they
are
used
almost
as
public
streets
or
rather
as
public
squares
my
first
impression
was
that
i
was
in
some
sort
of
high
street
or
during
a
carnival
or
a
revolution
true
the
people
looked
rather
rich
for
a
revolution
and
rather
grave
for
a
carnival
but
they
were
congested
in
great
crowds
that
moved
slowly
like
people
passing
through
an
overcrowded
railway
station
even
in
the
dizzy
heights
of
such
a
there
could
not
possibly
be
room
for
all
those
people
to
sleep
in
the
hotel
or
even
to
dine
in
it
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
did
nothing
whatever
except
drift
into
it
and
drift
out
again
most
of
them
had
no
more
to
do
with
the
hotel
than
i
have
with
buckingham
palace
i
have
never
been
in
buckingham
palace
and
i
have
very
seldom
thank
god
been
in
the
big
hotels
of
this
type
that
exist
in
london
or
paris
but
i
can
not
believe
that
mobs
are
perpetually
pouring
through
the
hotel
cecil
or
the
savoy
in
this
fashion
calmly
coming
in
at
one
door
and
going
out
of
the
other
but
this
fact
is
part
of
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
american
hotel
it
is
built
upon
a
compromise
that
makes
it
possible
the
whole
of
the
lower
floor
is
thrown
open
to
the
public
streets
and
treated
as
a
public
square
but
above
it
and
all
round
it
runs
another
floor
in
the
form
of
a
sort
of
deep
gallery
furnished
more
luxuriously
and
looking
down
on
the
moving
mobs
beneath
no
one
is
allowed
on
this
floor
except
the
guests
or
clients
of
the
hotel
as
i
have
been
one
of
them
myself
i
trust
it
is
not
unsympathetic
to
compare
them
to
active
anthropoids
who
can
climb
trees
and
so
look
down
in
safety
on
the
herds
or
packs
of
wilder
animals
wandering
and
prowling
below
of
course
there
are
modifications
of
this
architectural
plan
but
they
are
generally
approximations
to
it
it
is
the
plan
that
seems
to
suit
the
social
life
of
the
american
cities
there
is
generally
something
like
a
ground
floor
that
is
more
public
a
or
gallery
above
that
is
more
private
and
above
that
the
bulk
of
the
block
of
bedrooms
the
huge
hive
with
its
innumerable
and
identical
cells
the
ladder
of
ascent
in
this
tower
is
of
course
the
lift
or
as
it
is
called
the
elevator
with
all
that
we
hear
of
american
hustle
and
hurry
it
is
rather
strange
that
americans
seem
to
like
more
than
we
do
to
linger
upon
long
words
and
indeed
there
is
an
element
of
delay
in
their
diction
and
spirit
very
little
understood
which
i
may
discuss
elsewhere
anyhow
they
say
elevator
when
we
say
lift
just
as
they
say
automobile
when
we
say
motor
and
stenographer
when
we
say
typist
or
sometimes
by
a
slight
confusion
typewriter
which
reminds
me
of
another
story
that
never
existed
about
a
man
who
was
accused
of
having
murdered
and
dismembered
his
secretary
when
he
had
only
taken
his
typing
machine
to
pieces
but
we
must
not
dwell
on
these
digressions
the
americans
may
have
another
reason
for
giving
long
and
ceremonious
titles
to
the
lift
when
first
i
came
among
them
i
had
a
suspicion
that
they
possessed
and
practised
a
new
and
secret
religion
which
was
the
cult
of
the
elevator
i
fancied
they
worshipped
the
lift
or
at
any
rate
worshipped
in
the
lift
the
details
or
data
of
this
suspicion
it
were
now
vain
to
collect
as
i
have
regretfully
abandoned
it
except
in
so
far
as
they
illustrate
the
social
principles
underlying
the
structural
plan
of
the
building
now
an
american
gentleman
invariably
takes
off
his
hat
in
the
lift
he
does
not
take
off
his
hat
in
the
hotel
even
if
it
is
crowded
with
ladies
but
he
always
so
salutes
a
lady
in
the
elevator
and
this
marks
the
difference
of
atmosphere
the
lift
is
a
room
but
the
hotel
is
a
street
but
during
my
first
delusion
of
course
i
assumed
that
he
uncovered
in
this
tiny
temple
merely
because
he
was
in
church
there
is
something
about
the
very
word
elevator
that
expresses
a
great
deal
of
his
vague
but
idealistic
religion
perhaps
that
flying
chapel
will
eventually
be
ritualistically
decorated
like
a
chapel
possibly
with
a
symbolic
scheme
of
wings
perhaps
a
brief
religious
service
will
be
held
in
the
elevator
as
it
ascends
in
a
few
words
touching
the
utmost
for
the
highest
possibly
he
would
consent
even
to
call
the
elevator
a
lift
if
he
could
call
it
an
uplift
there
would
be
no
difficulty
except
what
i
can
not
but
regard
as
the
chief
moral
problem
of
all
optimistic
modernism
i
mean
the
difficulty
of
imagining
a
lift
which
is
free
to
go
up
if
it
is
not
also
free
to
go
down
i
think
i
know
my
american
friends
and
acquaintances
too
well
to
apologise
for
any
levity
in
these
illustrations
americans
make
fun
of
their
own
institutions
and
their
own
journalism
is
full
of
such
fanciful
conjectures
the
tall
building
is
itself
artistically
akin
to
the
tall
story
the
very
word
is
an
admirable
example
of
an
american
lie
but
i
can
testify
quite
as
eagerly
to
the
solid
and
sensible
advantages
of
the
symmetrical
hotel
it
is
not
only
a
pattern
of
vases
and
stuffed
flamingoes
it
is
also
an
equally
accurate
pattern
of
cupboards
and
baths
it
is
a
dignified
and
humane
custom
to
have
a
bathroom
attached
to
every
bedroom
and
my
impulse
to
sing
the
praises
of
it
brought
me
once
at
least
into
a
rather
quaint
complication
i
think
it
was
in
the
city
of
dayton
anyhow
i
remember
there
was
a
laundry
convention
going
on
in
the
same
hotel
in
a
room
very
patriotically
and
properly
festooned
with
the
stars
and
stripes
and
doubtless
full
of
promise
for
the
future
of
laundering
i
was
interviewed
on
the
roof
within
earshot
of
this
debate
and
may
have
been
the
victim
of
some
association
or
confusion
anyhow
after
answering
the
usual
questions
about
labour
the
league
of
nations
the
length
of
ladies
dresses
and
other
great
matters
i
took
refuge
in
a
rhapsody
of
warm
and
praise
of
american
bathrooms
the
editor
i
understand
running
a
gloomy
eye
down
the
column
of
his
contributor
and
seeing
nothing
but
metaphysical
terms
such
as
justice
freedom
the
abstract
disapproval
of
sweating
swindling
and
the
like
paused
at
last
upon
the
ablutionary
allusion
and
his
eye
brightened
the
only
copy
in
the
whole
thing
he
said
in
every
home
so
these
words
appeared
in
enormous
letters
above
my
portrait
in
the
paper
it
will
be
noted
that
like
many
things
that
practical
men
make
a
great
point
of
they
miss
the
point
what
i
had
commended
as
new
and
national
was
a
bathroom
in
every
bedroom
even
feudal
and
england
is
not
entirely
ignorant
of
an
occasional
in
the
home
but
what
gave
me
great
joy
was
what
followed
i
discovered
with
delight
that
many
people
glancing
rapidly
at
my
portrait
with
its
prodigious
legend
imagined
that
it
was
a
commercial
advertisement
and
that
i
was
a
very
commercial
traveller
when
i
walked
about
the
streets
i
was
supposed
to
be
travelling
in
consider
the
caption
of
the
portrait
and
you
will
see
how
similar
it
is
to
the
true
commercial
slogan
offer
a
in
every
home
and
this
charming
error
was
doubtless
clinched
by
the
fact
that
i
had
been
found
haunting
the
outer
courts
of
the
temple
of
the
ancient
guild
of
lavenders
i
never
knew
how
many
shared
the
impression
i
regret
to
say
that
i
only
traced
it
with
certainty
in
two
individuals
but
i
understand
that
it
included
the
idea
that
i
had
come
to
the
town
to
attend
the
laundry
convention
and
had
made
an
eloquent
speech
to
that
senate
no
doubt
exhibiting
my
tubs
such
was
the
penalty
of
too
passionate
and
unrestrained
an
admiration
for
american
bathrooms
yet
the
connection
of
ideas
however
inconsequent
does
cover
the
part
of
social
practice
for
which
these
american
institutions
can
really
be
praised
about
everything
like
laundry
or
hot
and
cold
water
there
is
not
only
organisation
but
what
does
not
always
or
perhaps
often
go
with
it
efficiency
americans
are
particular
about
these
things
of
dress
and
decorum
and
it
is
a
virtue
which
i
very
seriously
recognise
though
i
find
it
very
hard
to
emulate
but
with
them
it
is
a
virtue
it
is
not
a
mere
convention
still
less
a
mere
fashion
it
is
really
related
to
human
dignity
rather
than
to
social
superiority
the
really
glorious
thing
about
the
american
is
that
he
does
not
dress
like
a
gentleman
he
dresses
like
a
citizen
or
a
civilised
man
his
puritanic
particularity
on
certain
points
is
really
detachable
from
any
definite
social
ambitions
these
things
are
not
a
part
of
getting
into
society
but
merely
of
keeping
out
of
savagery
those
millions
and
millions
of
middling
people
that
huge
middle
class
especially
of
the
middle
west
are
not
near
enough
to
any
aristocracy
even
to
be
sham
aristocrats
or
to
be
real
snobs
but
their
standards
are
secure
and
though
i
do
not
really
travel
in
a
or
believe
in
the
philosophy
and
religion
i
will
not
on
this
matter
recoil
misanthropically
from
them
i
prefer
the
tub
of
dayton
to
the
tub
of
diogenes
on
these
points
there
is
really
something
a
million
times
better
than
efficiency
and
that
is
something
like
equality
in
short
the
american
hotel
is
not
america
but
it
is
american
in
some
respects
it
is
as
american
as
the
english
inn
is
english
and
it
is
symbolic
of
that
society
in
this
among
other
things
that
it
does
tend
too
much
to
uniformity
but
that
that
very
uniformity
disguises
not
a
little
natural
dignity
the
old
romans
boasted
that
their
republic
was
a
nation
of
kings
if
we
really
walked
abroad
in
such
a
kingdom
we
might
very
well
grow
tired
of
the
sight
of
a
crowd
of
kings
of
every
man
with
a
gold
crown
on
his
head
or
an
ivory
sceptre
in
his
hand
but
it
is
arguable
that
we
ought
not
to
grow
tired
of
the
repetition
of
crowns
and
sceptres
any
more
than
of
the
repetition
of
flowers
and
stars
the
whole
imaginative
effort
of
walt
whitman
was
really
an
effort
to
absorb
and
animate
these
multitudinous
modern
repetitions
and
walt
whitman
would
be
quite
capable
of
including
in
his
lyric
litany
of
optimism
a
list
of
the
nine
hundred
and
identical
bathrooms
i
do
not
sneer
at
the
generous
effort
of
the
giant
though
i
think
when
all
is
said
that
it
is
a
criticism
of
modern
machinery
that
the
effort
should
be
gigantic
as
well
as
generous
while
there
is
so
much
repetition
there
is
little
repose
it
is
the
pattern
of
a
kaleidoscope
rather
than
a
a
pattern
of
figures
running
and
even
leaping
like
the
figures
in
a
zoetrope
but
even
in
the
groups
where
there
was
no
hustle
there
was
often
something
of
homelessness
i
do
not
mean
merely
that
they
were
not
dining
at
home
but
rather
that
they
were
not
at
home
even
when
dining
and
dining
at
their
favourite
hotel
they
would
frequently
start
up
and
dart
from
the
room
at
a
summons
from
the
telephone
it
may
have
been
fanciful
but
i
could
not
help
feeling
a
breath
of
home
as
from
a
flap
or
flutter
of
george
cross
when
i
first
sat
down
in
a
canadian
hostelry
and
read
the
announcement
that
no
such
telephonic
or
other
summonses
were
allowed
in
the
it
may
have
been
a
coincidence
and
there
may
be
american
hotels
with
this
merciful
proviso
and
canadian
hotels
without
it
but
the
thing
was
symbolic
even
if
it
was
not
evidential
i
felt
as
if
i
stood
indeed
upon
english
soil
in
a
place
where
people
liked
to
have
their
meals
in
peace
the
process
of
the
summons
is
called
and
consists
of
sending
a
little
boy
with
a
large
voice
through
all
the
halls
and
corridors
of
the
building
making
them
resound
with
a
name
the
custom
is
common
of
course
in
clubs
and
hotels
even
in
england
but
in
england
it
is
a
mere
whisper
compared
with
the
wail
with
which
the
american
page
repeats
the
formula
of
mr
so
and
so
i
remember
a
particularly
crowded
in
the
somewhat
smoky
and
oppressive
atmosphere
of
pittsburg
through
which
wandered
a
youth
with
a
voice
the
like
of
which
i
have
never
heard
in
the
land
of
the
living
a
voice
like
the
cry
of
a
lost
spirit
saying
again
and
again
for
ever
mr
anderson
one
felt
that
he
never
would
find
anderson
perhaps
there
never
had
been
any
anderson
to
be
found
perhaps
he
and
every
one
else
wandered
in
an
abyss
of
bottomless
scepticism
and
he
was
but
the
victim
of
one
out
of
numberless
nightmares
of
eternity
as
he
wandered
a
shadow
with
shadows
and
wailed
by
impassable
streams
this
is
not
exactly
my
philosophy
but
i
feel
sure
it
was
his
and
it
is
a
mood
that
may
frequently
visit
the
mind
in
the
centres
of
highly
active
and
successful
industrial
civilisation
such
are
the
first
idle
impressions
of
the
great
american
hotel
gained
by
sitting
for
the
first
time
in
its
gallery
and
gazing
on
its
drifting
crowds
with
thoughts
equally
drifting
the
first
impression
is
of
something
enormous
and
rather
unnatural
an
impression
that
is
gradually
tempered
by
experience
of
the
kindliness
and
even
the
tameness
of
so
much
of
that
social
order
but
i
should
not
be
recording
the
sensations
with
sincerity
if
i
did
not
touch
in
passing
the
note
of
something
unearthly
about
that
vast
system
to
an
insular
traveller
who
sees
it
for
the
first
time
it
is
as
if
he
were
wandering
in
another
world
among
the
fixed
stars
or
worse
still
in
an
ideal
utopia
of
the
future
yet
i
am
not
certain
and
perhaps
the
best
of
all
news
is
that
nothing
is
really
new
i
sometimes
have
a
fancy
that
many
of
these
new
things
in
new
countries
are
but
the
resurrections
of
old
things
which
have
been
wickedly
killed
or
stupidly
stunted
in
old
countries
i
have
looked
over
the
sea
of
little
tables
in
some
light
and
airy
cafÃ©
and
my
thoughts
have
gone
back
to
the
plain
wooden
bench
and
wooden
table
that
stands
solitary
and
outside
so
many
neglected
english
inns
we
talk
of
experimenting
in
the
french
cafÃ©
as
of
some
fresh
and
almost
impudent
innovation
but
our
fathers
had
the
french
cafÃ©
in
the
sense
of
the
table
in
the
sun
and
air
the
only
difference
was
that
french
democracy
was
allowed
to
develop
its
cafÃ©
or
multiply
its
tables
while
english
plutocracy
prevented
any
such
popular
growth
perhaps
there
are
other
examples
of
old
types
and
patterns
lost
in
the
old
oligarchy
and
saved
in
the
new
democracies
i
am
haunted
with
a
hint
that
the
new
structures
are
not
so
very
new
and
that
they
remind
me
of
something
very
old
as
i
look
from
the
balcony
floor
the
crowds
seem
to
float
away
and
the
colours
to
soften
and
grow
pale
and
i
know
i
am
in
one
of
the
simplest
and
most
ancestral
of
human
habitations
i
am
looking
down
from
the
old
wooden
gallery
upon
the
courtyard
of
an
inn
this
new
architectural
model
which
i
have
described
is
after
all
one
of
the
oldest
european
models
now
neglected
in
europe
and
especially
in
england
it
was
the
theatre
in
which
were
enacted
innumerable
picaresque
comedies
and
romantic
plays
with
figures
ranging
from
sancho
panza
to
sam
weller
it
served
as
the
apparatus
like
some
gigantic
toy
set
up
in
bricks
and
timber
for
the
ancient
and
perhaps
eternal
game
of
tennis
the
very
terms
of
the
original
game
were
taken
from
the
inn
courtyard
and
the
players
scored
accordingly
as
they
hit
the
or
the
roof
singular
speculations
hover
in
my
mind
as
the
scene
darkens
and
the
quadrangle
below
begins
to
empty
in
the
last
hours
of
night
some
day
perhaps
this
huge
structure
will
be
found
standing
in
a
solitude
like
a
skeleton
and
it
will
be
the
skeleton
of
the
spotted
dog
or
the
blue
boar
it
will
wither
and
decay
until
it
is
worthy
at
last
to
be
a
tavern
i
do
not
know
whether
men
will
play
tennis
on
its
ground
floor
with
various
scores
and
prizes
for
hitting
the
electric
fan
or
the
lift
or
the
head
waiter
perhaps
the
very
words
will
only
remain
as
part
of
some
such
rustic
game
perhaps
the
electric
fan
will
no
longer
be
electric
and
the
elevator
will
no
longer
elevate
and
the
waiter
will
only
wait
to
be
hit
but
at
least
it
is
only
by
the
decay
of
modern
plutocracy
which
seems
already
to
have
begun
that
the
secret
of
the
structure
even
of
this
plutocratic
palace
can
stand
revealed
and
after
long
years
when
its
lights
are
extinguished
and
only
the
long
shadows
inhabit
its
halls
and
vestibules
there
may
come
a
new
noise
like
thunder
of
knocking
at
the
door
meditation
in
when
i
had
looked
at
the
lights
of
broadway
by
night
i
made
to
my
american
friends
an
innocent
remark
that
seemed
for
some
reason
to
amuse
them
i
had
looked
not
without
joy
at
that
long
kaleidoscope
of
coloured
lights
arranged
in
large
letters
and
sprawling
advertising
everything
from
pork
to
pianos
through
the
agency
of
the
two
most
vivid
and
most
mystical
of
the
gifts
of
god
colour
and
fire
i
said
to
them
in
my
simplicity
a
glorious
garden
of
wonders
this
would
be
to
any
one
who
was
lucky
enough
to
be
unable
to
read
here
it
is
but
a
text
for
a
further
suggestion
but
let
us
suppose
that
there
does
walk
down
this
flaming
avenue
a
peasant
of
the
sort
called
scornfully
an
illiterate
peasant
by
those
who
think
that
insisting
on
people
reading
and
writing
is
the
best
way
to
keep
out
the
spies
who
read
in
all
languages
and
the
forgers
who
write
in
all
hands
on
this
principle
indeed
a
peasant
merely
acquainted
with
things
of
little
practical
use
to
mankind
such
as
ploughing
cutting
wood
or
growing
vegetables
would
very
probably
be
excluded
and
it
is
not
for
us
to
criticise
from
the
outside
the
philosophy
of
those
who
would
keep
out
the
farmer
and
let
in
the
forger
but
let
us
suppose
if
only
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
peasant
is
walking
under
the
artificial
suns
and
stars
of
this
tremendous
thoroughfare
that
he
has
escaped
to
the
land
of
liberty
upon
some
general
rumour
and
romance
of
the
story
of
its
liberation
but
without
being
yet
able
to
understand
the
arbitrary
signs
of
its
alphabet
the
soul
of
such
a
man
would
surely
soar
higher
than
the
and
embrace
a
brotherhood
broader
than
broadway
realising
that
he
had
arrived
on
an
evening
of
exceptional
festivity
worthy
to
be
blazoned
with
all
this
burning
heraldry
he
would
please
himself
by
guessing
what
great
proclamation
or
principle
of
the
republic
hung
in
the
sky
like
a
constellation
or
rippled
across
the
street
like
a
comet
he
would
be
shrewd
enough
to
guess
that
the
three
festoons
fringed
with
fiery
words
of
somewhat
similar
pattern
stood
for
of
the
people
for
the
people
by
the
people
for
it
must
obviously
be
that
unless
it
were
equality
fraternity
his
shrewdness
would
perhaps
be
a
little
shaken
if
he
knew
that
the
triad
stood
for
tonic
tang
tonic
tang
tonic
all
the
time
he
will
soon
identify
a
restless
ribbon
of
red
lettering
red
hot
and
rebellious
as
the
saying
me
liberty
or
give
me
death
he
will
fail
to
identify
it
as
the
equally
famous
saying
has
gout
beaten
to
a
frazzle
therefore
it
was
that
i
desired
the
peasant
to
walk
down
that
grove
of
fiery
trees
under
all
that
golden
foliage
and
fruits
like
monstrous
jewels
as
innocent
as
adam
before
the
fall
he
would
see
sights
almost
as
fine
as
the
flaming
sword
or
the
purple
and
peacock
plumage
of
the
seraphim
so
long
as
he
did
not
go
near
the
tree
of
knowledge
in
other
words
if
once
he
went
to
school
it
would
be
all
up
and
indeed
i
fear
in
any
case
he
would
soon
discover
his
error
if
he
stood
wildly
waving
his
hat
for
liberty
in
the
middle
of
the
road
as
chunk
chutney
picked
itself
out
in
ruby
stars
upon
the
sky
he
would
impede
the
excellent
but
extremely
rigid
traffic
system
of
new
york
if
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
a
sapphire
splendour
and
began
saying
an
ave
maria
under
a
mistaken
association
he
would
be
conducted
kindly
but
firmly
by
an
irish
policeman
to
a
more
authentic
shrine
but
though
the
foreign
simplicity
might
not
long
survive
in
new
york
it
is
quite
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
such
foreign
simplicity
can
not
enter
new
york
he
may
be
excluded
for
being
illiterate
but
he
can
not
be
excluded
for
being
ignorant
nor
for
being
innocent
least
of
all
can
he
be
excluded
for
being
wiser
in
his
innocence
than
the
world
in
its
knowledge
there
is
here
indeed
more
than
one
distinction
to
be
made
new
york
is
a
cosmopolitan
city
but
it
is
not
a
city
of
cosmopolitans
most
of
the
masses
in
new
york
have
a
nation
whether
or
no
it
be
the
nation
to
which
new
york
belongs
those
who
are
americanised
are
american
and
very
patriotically
american
those
who
are
not
thus
nationalised
are
not
in
the
least
internationalised
they
simply
continue
to
be
themselves
the
irish
are
irish
the
jews
are
jewish
and
all
sorts
of
other
tribes
carry
on
the
traditions
of
remote
european
valleys
almost
untouched
in
short
there
is
a
sort
of
slender
bridge
between
their
old
country
and
their
new
which
they
either
cross
or
do
not
cross
but
which
they
seldom
simply
occupy
they
are
exiles
or
they
are
citizens
there
is
no
moment
when
they
are
cosmopolitans
but
very
often
the
exiles
bring
with
them
not
only
rooted
traditions
but
rooted
truths
indeed
it
is
to
a
great
extent
the
thought
of
these
strange
souls
in
crude
american
garb
that
gives
a
meaning
to
the
masquerade
of
new
york
in
the
hotel
where
i
stayed
the
head
waiter
in
one
room
was
a
bohemian
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
he
called
himself
a
bohemian
i
have
already
protested
sufficiently
before
american
audiences
against
the
pedantry
of
perpetually
talking
about
i
suggested
to
my
american
friends
that
the
abandonment
of
the
word
bohemian
in
its
historical
sense
might
well
extend
to
its
literary
and
figurative
sense
we
might
be
expected
to
say
afraid
henry
has
got
into
very
habits
lately
or
bother
to
dress
it
quite
a
affair
anyhow
my
bohemian
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
nonsense
he
called
himself
a
son
of
bohemia
and
spoke
as
such
in
his
criticisms
of
america
which
were
both
favourable
and
unfavourable
he
was
a
squat
man
with
a
sturdy
figure
and
a
steady
smile
and
his
eyes
were
like
dark
pools
in
the
depth
of
a
darker
forest
but
i
do
not
think
he
had
ever
been
deceived
by
the
lights
of
broadway
but
i
found
something
like
my
real
innocent
abroad
my
real
peasant
among
the
in
another
part
of
the
same
establishment
he
was
a
much
leaner
man
equally
dark
with
a
hook
nose
hungry
face
and
fierce
black
moustaches
he
also
was
a
waiter
and
was
in
the
costume
of
a
waiter
which
is
a
smarter
edition
of
the
costume
of
a
lecturer
as
he
was
serving
me
with
clam
chowder
or
some
such
thing
i
fell
into
speech
with
him
and
he
told
me
he
was
a
bulgar
i
said
something
like
afraid
i
do
know
as
much
as
i
ought
to
about
bulgaria
i
suppose
most
of
your
people
are
agricultural
are
they
he
did
not
stir
an
inch
from
his
regular
attitude
but
he
slightly
lowered
his
low
voice
and
said
from
the
earth
we
come
and
to
the
earth
we
return
when
people
get
away
from
that
they
are
lost
to
hear
such
a
thing
said
by
the
waiter
was
alone
an
epoch
in
the
life
of
an
unfortunate
writer
of
fantastic
novels
to
see
him
clear
away
the
clam
chowder
like
an
automaton
and
bring
me
more
iced
water
like
an
automaton
or
like
nothing
on
earth
except
an
american
waiter
for
piling
up
ice
is
the
cold
passion
of
their
lives
and
all
this
after
having
uttered
something
so
dark
and
deep
so
starkly
incongruous
and
so
startlingly
true
was
an
indescribable
thing
but
very
like
the
picture
of
the
peasant
admiring
broadway
so
he
passed
with
his
artificial
clothes
and
manners
lit
up
with
all
the
ghastly
artificial
light
of
the
hotel
and
all
the
ghastly
artificial
life
of
the
city
and
his
heart
was
like
his
own
remote
and
rocky
valley
where
those
unchanging
words
were
carved
as
on
a
rock
i
do
not
profess
to
discuss
here
at
all
adequately
the
question
this
raises
about
the
americanisation
of
the
bulgar
it
has
many
aspects
of
some
of
which
most
englishmen
and
even
some
americans
are
rather
unconscious
for
one
thing
a
man
with
so
rugged
a
loyalty
to
land
could
not
be
americanised
in
new
york
but
it
is
not
so
certain
that
he
could
not
be
americanised
in
america
we
might
almost
say
that
a
peasantry
is
hidden
in
the
heart
of
america
so
far
as
our
impressions
go
it
is
a
secret
it
is
rather
an
open
secret
covering
only
some
thousand
square
miles
of
open
prairie
but
for
most
of
our
countrymen
it
is
something
invisible
unimagined
and
unvisited
the
simple
truth
that
where
all
those
acres
are
there
is
agriculture
and
where
all
that
agriculture
is
there
is
considerable
tendency
towards
distributive
or
decently
equalised
property
as
in
a
peasantry
on
the
other
hand
there
are
those
who
say
that
the
bulgar
will
never
be
americanised
that
he
only
comes
to
be
a
waiter
in
america
that
he
may
afford
to
return
to
be
a
peasant
in
bulgaria
i
can
not
decide
this
issue
and
indeed
i
did
not
introduce
it
to
this
end
i
was
led
to
it
by
a
certain
line
of
reflection
that
runs
along
the
great
white
way
and
i
will
continue
to
follow
it
the
criticism
if
we
could
put
it
rightly
not
only
covers
more
than
new
york
but
more
than
the
whole
new
world
any
argument
against
it
is
quite
as
valid
against
the
largest
and
richest
cities
of
the
old
world
against
london
or
liverpool
or
frankfort
or
belfast
but
it
is
in
new
york
that
we
see
the
argument
most
clearly
because
we
see
the
thing
thus
towering
into
its
own
turrets
and
breaking
into
its
own
fireworks
i
disagree
with
the
aesthetic
condemnation
of
the
modern
city
with
its
and
i
mean
that
which
laments
the
loss
of
beauty
and
its
sacrifice
to
utility
it
seems
to
me
the
very
reverse
of
the
truth
years
ago
when
people
used
to
say
the
salvation
army
doubtless
had
good
intentions
but
we
must
all
deplore
its
methods
i
pointed
out
that
the
very
contrary
is
the
case
its
method
the
method
of
drums
and
democratic
appeal
is
that
of
the
franciscans
or
any
other
march
of
the
church
militant
it
was
precisely
its
aims
that
were
dubious
with
their
dissenting
morality
and
despotic
finance
it
is
somewhat
the
same
with
things
like
the
in
broadway
the
aesthete
must
not
ask
me
to
mingle
my
tears
with
his
because
these
things
are
merely
useful
and
ugly
for
i
am
not
specially
inclined
to
think
them
ugly
but
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
think
them
useless
as
a
matter
of
art
for
sake
they
seem
to
me
rather
artistic
as
a
form
of
practical
social
work
they
seem
to
me
stark
stupid
waste
if
bilge
is
rich
enough
to
build
a
tower
four
hundred
feet
high
and
give
it
a
crown
of
golden
crescents
and
crimson
stars
in
order
to
draw
attention
to
his
manufacture
of
the
paradise
tooth
paste
or
the
seventh
heaven
cigar
i
do
not
feel
the
least
disposition
to
thank
him
for
any
serious
form
of
social
service
i
have
never
tried
the
seventh
heaven
cigar
indeed
a
premonition
moves
me
towards
the
belief
that
i
shall
go
down
to
the
dust
without
trying
it
i
have
every
reason
to
doubt
whether
it
does
any
particular
good
to
those
who
smoke
it
or
any
good
to
anybody
except
those
who
sell
it
in
short
bilge
usefulness
consists
in
being
useful
to
bilge
and
all
the
rest
is
illusion
and
sentimentalism
but
because
i
know
that
bilge
is
only
bilge
shall
i
stoop
to
the
profanity
of
saying
that
fire
is
only
fire
shall
i
blaspheme
crimson
stars
any
more
than
crimson
sunsets
or
deny
that
those
moons
are
golden
any
more
than
that
this
grass
is
green
if
a
child
saw
these
coloured
lights
he
would
dance
with
as
much
delight
as
at
any
other
coloured
toys
and
it
is
the
duty
of
every
poet
and
even
of
every
critic
to
dance
in
respectful
imitation
of
the
child
indeed
i
am
in
a
mood
of
so
much
sympathy
with
the
fairy
lights
of
this
pantomime
city
that
i
should
be
almost
sorry
to
see
social
sanity
and
a
sense
of
proportion
return
to
extinguish
them
i
fear
the
day
is
breaking
and
the
broad
daylight
of
tradition
and
ancient
truth
is
coming
to
end
all
this
delightful
nightmare
of
new
york
at
night
peasants
and
priests
and
all
sorts
of
practical
and
sensible
people
are
coming
back
into
power
and
their
stern
realism
may
wither
all
these
beautiful
unsubstantial
useless
things
they
will
not
believe
in
the
seventh
heaven
cigar
even
when
they
see
it
shining
as
with
stars
in
the
seventh
heaven
they
will
not
be
affected
by
advertisements
any
more
than
the
priests
and
peasants
of
the
middle
ages
would
have
been
affected
by
advertisements
only
a
very
sentimental
and
rather
servile
generation
of
men
could
possibly
be
affected
by
advertisements
at
all
people
who
are
a
little
more
humorous
and
intellectually
independent
see
the
rather
simple
joke
and
are
not
impressed
by
this
or
any
other
form
of
almost
any
other
men
in
almost
any
other
age
would
have
seen
the
joke
if
you
had
said
to
a
man
in
the
stone
age
says
ugg
makes
the
best
stone
hatchets
he
would
have
perceived
a
lack
of
detachment
and
disinterestedness
about
the
testimonial
if
you
had
said
to
a
medieval
peasant
the
bowyer
proclaims
with
three
blasts
of
a
horn
that
he
makes
good
bows
the
peasant
would
have
said
of
course
he
does
and
thought
about
something
more
important
it
is
only
among
people
whose
minds
have
been
weakened
by
a
sort
of
mesmerism
that
so
transparent
a
trick
as
that
of
advertisement
could
ever
have
been
tried
at
all
and
if
ever
we
have
again
as
for
other
reasons
i
can
not
but
hope
we
shall
a
more
democratic
distribution
of
property
and
a
more
agricultural
basis
of
national
life
it
would
seem
at
first
sight
only
too
likely
that
all
this
beautiful
superstition
will
perish
and
the
fairyland
of
broadway
with
all
its
varied
rainbows
fade
away
for
such
people
the
seventh
heaven
cigar
like
the
city
will
have
ended
in
smoke
and
even
the
smoke
of
it
will
have
vanished
but
the
next
stage
of
reflection
brings
us
back
to
the
peasant
looking
at
the
lights
of
broadway
it
is
not
true
to
say
in
the
strict
sense
that
the
peasant
has
never
seen
such
things
before
the
truth
is
that
he
has
seen
them
on
a
much
smaller
scale
but
for
a
much
larger
purpose
peasants
also
have
their
ritual
and
ornament
but
it
is
to
adorn
more
real
things
apart
from
our
first
fancy
about
the
peasant
who
could
not
read
there
is
no
doubt
about
what
would
be
apparent
to
a
peasant
who
could
read
and
who
could
understand
for
him
also
fire
is
sacred
for
him
also
colour
is
symbolic
but
where
he
sets
up
a
candle
to
light
the
little
shrine
of
joseph
he
finds
it
takes
twelve
hundred
candles
to
light
the
seventh
heaven
cigar
he
is
used
to
the
colours
in
church
windows
showing
red
for
martyrs
or
blue
for
madonnas
but
here
he
can
only
conclude
that
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
belong
to
bilge
now
upon
the
aesthetic
side
he
might
well
be
impressed
but
it
is
exactly
on
the
social
and
even
scientific
side
that
he
has
a
right
to
criticise
if
he
were
a
chinese
peasant
for
instance
and
came
from
a
land
of
fireworks
he
would
naturally
suppose
that
he
had
happened
to
arrive
at
a
great
firework
display
in
celebration
of
something
perhaps
the
sacred
emperor
birthday
or
rather
birthnight
it
would
gradually
dawn
on
the
chinese
philosopher
that
the
emperor
could
hardly
be
born
every
night
and
when
he
learnt
the
truth
the
philosopher
if
he
was
a
philosopher
would
be
a
little
disappointed
possibly
a
little
disdainful
compare
for
instance
these
everlasting
fireworks
with
the
damp
squibs
and
dying
bonfires
of
guy
fawkes
day
that
quaint
and
even
queer
national
festival
has
been
fading
for
some
time
out
of
english
life
still
it
was
a
national
festival
in
the
double
sense
that
it
represented
some
sort
of
public
spirit
pursued
by
some
sort
of
popular
impulse
people
spent
money
on
the
display
of
fireworks
they
did
not
get
money
by
it
and
the
people
who
spent
money
were
often
those
who
had
very
little
money
to
spend
it
had
something
of
the
glorious
and
fanatical
character
of
making
the
poor
poorer
it
did
not
like
the
advertisements
have
only
the
mean
and
materialistic
character
of
making
the
rich
richer
in
short
it
came
from
the
people
and
it
appealed
to
the
nation
the
historical
and
religious
cause
in
which
it
originated
is
not
mine
and
i
think
it
has
perished
partly
through
being
tied
to
a
historical
theory
for
which
there
is
no
future
i
think
this
is
illustrated
in
the
very
fact
that
the
ceremonial
is
merely
negative
and
destructive
negation
and
destruction
are
very
noble
things
as
far
as
they
go
and
when
they
go
in
the
right
direction
and
the
popular
expression
of
them
has
always
something
hearty
and
human
about
it
i
shall
not
therefore
bring
any
fine
or
fastidious
criticism
whether
literary
or
musical
to
bear
upon
the
little
boys
who
drag
about
a
bolster
and
a
paper
mask
calling
out
guy
fawkes
guy
hit
him
in
the
eye
but
i
admit
it
is
a
disadvantage
that
they
have
not
a
saint
or
hero
to
crown
in
effigy
as
well
as
a
traitor
to
burn
in
effigy
i
admit
that
popular
protestantism
has
become
too
purely
negative
for
people
to
wreathe
in
flowers
the
statue
of
kensit
or
even
of
clifford
i
do
not
disguise
my
preference
for
popular
catholicism
which
still
has
statues
that
can
be
wreathed
in
flowers
i
wish
our
national
feast
of
fireworks
revolved
round
something
positive
and
popular
i
wish
the
beauty
of
a
catherine
wheel
were
displayed
to
the
glory
of
catherine
i
should
not
especially
complain
if
roman
candles
were
really
roman
candles
but
this
negative
character
does
not
destroy
the
national
character
which
began
at
least
in
disinterested
faith
and
has
ended
at
least
in
disinterested
fun
there
is
nothing
disinterested
at
all
about
the
new
commercial
fireworks
there
is
nothing
so
dignified
as
a
dingy
guy
among
the
lights
of
broadway
in
that
thoroughfare
indeed
the
very
word
guy
has
another
and
milder
significance
an
american
friend
congratulated
me
on
the
impression
i
produced
on
a
lady
interviewer
observing
says
you
a
regular
guy
this
puzzled
me
a
little
at
the
time
description
is
no
doubt
correct
i
said
i
confess
that
it
would
never
have
struck
me
as
specially
complimentary
but
it
appears
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
graceful
of
compliments
in
the
original
american
a
guy
in
america
is
a
colourless
term
for
a
human
being
all
men
are
guys
being
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
but
i
am
misled
by
another
association
and
a
regular
guy
means
i
presume
a
reliable
or
respectable
guy
the
point
here
however
is
that
the
guy
in
the
grotesque
english
sense
does
represent
the
dilapidated
remnant
of
a
real
human
tradition
of
symbolising
real
historic
ideals
by
the
sacramental
mystery
of
fire
it
is
a
great
fall
from
the
lowest
of
these
lowly
bonfires
to
the
highest
of
the
modern
the
new
illumination
does
not
stand
for
any
national
ideal
at
all
and
what
is
yet
more
to
the
point
it
does
not
come
from
any
popular
enthusiasm
at
all
that
is
where
it
differs
from
the
narrowest
national
protestantism
of
the
english
institution
mobs
have
risen
in
support
of
no
popery
no
mobs
are
likely
to
rise
in
defence
of
the
new
puffery
many
a
poor
crazy
orangeman
has
died
saying
hell
with
the
pope
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
man
will
ever
with
his
last
breath
frame
the
ecstatic
words
hugby
chewing
gum
these
modern
and
mercantile
legends
are
imposed
upon
us
by
a
mercantile
minority
and
we
are
merely
passive
to
the
suggestion
the
hypnotist
of
high
finance
or
big
business
merely
writes
his
commands
in
heaven
with
a
finger
of
fire
all
men
really
are
guys
in
the
sense
of
dummies
we
are
only
the
victims
of
his
pyrotechnic
violence
and
it
is
he
who
hits
us
in
the
eye
this
is
the
real
case
against
that
modern
society
that
is
symbolised
by
such
art
and
architecture
it
is
not
that
it
is
toppling
but
that
it
is
it
is
not
that
it
is
vulgar
but
rather
that
it
is
not
popular
in
other
words
the
democratic
ideal
of
countries
like
america
while
it
is
still
generally
sincere
and
sometimes
intense
is
at
issue
with
another
tendency
an
industrial
progress
which
is
of
all
things
on
earth
the
most
undemocratic
america
is
not
alone
in
possessing
the
industrialism
but
she
is
alone
in
emphasising
the
ideal
that
strives
with
industrialism
industrial
capitalism
and
ideal
democracy
are
everywhere
in
controversy
but
perhaps
only
here
are
they
in
conflict
france
has
a
democratic
ideal
but
france
is
not
industrial
england
and
germany
are
industrial
but
england
and
germany
are
not
really
democratic
of
course
when
i
speak
here
of
industrialism
i
speak
of
great
industrial
areas
there
is
as
will
be
noted
later
another
side
to
all
these
countries
there
is
in
america
itself
not
only
a
great
deal
of
agricultural
society
but
a
great
deal
of
agricultural
equality
just
as
there
are
still
peasants
in
germany
and
may
some
day
again
be
peasants
in
england
but
the
point
is
that
the
ideal
and
its
enemy
the
reality
are
here
crushed
very
close
to
each
other
in
the
high
narrow
city
and
that
the
is
truly
named
because
its
top
towering
in
such
insolence
is
scraping
the
stars
off
the
american
sky
the
very
heaven
of
the
american
spirit
that
seems
to
me
the
main
outline
of
the
whole
problem
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
book
i
have
emphasised
the
fact
that
equality
is
still
the
ideal
though
no
longer
the
reality
of
america
i
should
like
to
conclude
this
one
by
emphasising
the
fact
that
the
reality
of
modern
capitalism
is
menacing
that
ideal
with
terrors
and
even
splendours
that
might
well
stagger
the
wavering
and
impressionable
modern
spirit
upon
the
issue
of
that
struggle
depends
the
question
of
whether
this
new
great
civilisation
continues
to
exist
and
even
whether
any
one
cares
if
it
exists
or
not
i
have
already
used
the
parable
of
the
american
flag
and
the
stars
that
stand
for
a
multitudinous
equality
i
might
here
take
the
opposite
symbol
of
these
artificial
and
terrestrial
stars
flaming
on
the
forehead
of
the
commercial
city
and
note
the
peril
of
the
last
illusion
which
is
that
the
artificial
stars
may
seem
to
fill
the
heavens
and
the
real
stars
to
have
faded
from
sight
but
i
am
content
for
the
moment
to
reaffirm
the
merely
imaginative
pleasure
of
those
dizzy
turrets
and
dancing
fires
if
those
nightmare
buildings
were
really
all
built
for
nothing
how
noble
they
would
be
the
fact
that
they
were
really
built
for
something
need
not
unduly
depress
us
for
a
moment
or
drag
down
our
soaring
fancies
there
is
something
about
these
vertical
lines
that
suggests
a
sort
of
rush
upwards
as
of
great
cataracts
i
have
spoken
of
fireworks
but
here
i
should
rather
speak
of
rockets
there
is
only
something
underneath
the
mind
murmuring
that
nothing
remains
at
last
of
a
flaming
rocket
except
a
falling
stick
i
have
spoken
of
babylonian
perspectives
and
of
words
written
with
a
fiery
finger
like
that
huge
unhuman
finger
that
wrote
on
belshazzar
wall
but
what
did
it
write
on
belshazzar
wall
i
am
content
once
more
to
end
on
a
note
of
doubt
and
a
rather
dark
sympathy
with
those
solar
systems
turning
so
dizzily
far
up
in
the
divine
vacuum
of
the
night
the
earth
we
come
and
to
the
earth
we
return
when
people
get
away
from
that
they
are
lost
and
other
it
is
often
asked
what
should
be
the
first
thing
that
a
man
sees
when
he
lands
in
a
foreign
country
but
i
think
it
should
be
the
vision
of
his
own
country
at
least
when
i
came
into
new
york
harbour
a
sort
of
grey
and
green
cloud
came
between
me
and
the
towers
with
multitudinous
windows
white
in
the
winter
sunlight
and
i
saw
an
old
brown
house
standing
back
among
the
at
home
the
house
of
only
one
among
many
friends
and
neighbours
but
one
somehow
so
sunken
in
the
very
heart
of
england
as
to
be
unconscious
of
her
imperial
or
international
position
and
out
of
the
sound
of
her
perilous
seas
but
what
made
most
clear
the
vision
that
revisited
me
was
something
else
before
we
touched
land
the
men
of
my
own
guild
the
journalists
and
reporters
had
already
boarded
the
ship
like
pirates
and
one
of
them
spoke
to
me
in
an
accent
that
i
knew
and
thanked
me
for
all
i
had
done
for
ireland
and
it
was
at
that
moment
that
i
knew
most
vividly
that
what
i
wanted
was
to
do
something
for
england
then
as
it
chanced
i
looked
across
at
the
statue
of
liberty
and
saw
that
the
great
bronze
was
gleaming
green
in
the
morning
light
i
had
made
all
the
obvious
jokes
about
the
statue
of
liberty
i
found
it
had
a
soothing
effect
on
earnest
prohibitionists
on
the
boat
to
urge
as
a
point
of
dignity
and
delicacy
that
it
ought
to
be
given
back
to
the
french
a
vicious
race
abandoned
to
the
culture
of
the
vine
i
proposed
that
the
last
liquors
on
board
should
be
poured
out
in
a
pagan
libation
before
it
and
then
i
suddenly
remembered
that
this
liberty
was
still
in
some
sense
enlightening
the
world
or
one
part
of
the
world
was
a
lamp
for
one
sort
of
wanderer
a
star
of
one
sort
of
seafarer
to
one
persecuted
people
at
least
this
land
had
really
been
an
asylum
even
if
recent
legislation
as
i
have
said
had
made
them
think
it
a
lunatic
asylum
they
had
made
it
so
much
their
home
that
the
very
colour
of
the
country
seemed
to
change
with
the
infusion
as
the
bronze
of
the
great
statue
took
on
a
semblance
of
the
wearing
of
the
green
it
is
a
commonplace
that
the
englishman
has
been
stupid
in
his
relations
with
the
irish
but
he
has
been
far
more
stupid
in
his
relations
with
the
americans
on
the
subject
of
the
irish
his
propaganda
has
been
worse
than
his
practice
and
his
defence
more
than
the
most
indefensible
things
that
it
was
intended
to
defend
there
is
in
this
matter
a
curious
tangle
of
which
only
a
parallel
example
can
make
at
all
clear
and
i
will
note
the
point
here
because
it
is
some
testimony
to
its
vivid
importance
that
it
was
really
the
first
i
had
to
discuss
on
american
soil
with
an
american
citizen
in
a
double
sense
i
touched
ireland
before
i
came
to
america
i
will
take
an
imaginary
instance
from
another
controversy
in
order
to
show
how
the
apology
can
be
worse
than
the
action
the
best
we
can
say
for
ourselves
is
worse
than
the
worst
that
we
can
do
there
was
a
time
when
english
poets
and
other
publicists
could
always
be
inspired
with
instantaneous
indignation
about
the
persecuted
jews
in
russia
we
have
heard
less
about
them
since
we
heard
more
about
the
persecuting
jews
in
russia
i
fear
there
are
a
great
many
englishmen
already
who
wish
that
trotsky
had
been
persecuted
a
little
more
but
even
in
those
days
englishmen
divided
their
minds
in
a
curious
fashion
and
unconsciously
distinguished
between
the
jews
whom
they
had
never
seen
in
warsaw
and
the
jews
whom
they
had
often
seen
in
whitechapel
it
seemed
to
be
assumed
that
by
a
curious
coincidence
russia
possessed
not
only
the
very
worst
but
the
very
best
semites
a
moneylender
in
london
might
be
like
judas
iscariot
but
a
moneylender
in
moscow
must
be
like
judas
maccabaeus
nevertheless
there
remained
in
our
common
sense
an
unconscious
but
fundamental
comprehension
of
the
unity
of
israel
a
sense
that
some
things
could
be
said
and
some
could
not
be
said
about
the
jews
as
a
whole
suppose
that
even
in
those
days
to
say
nothing
of
these
an
english
protest
against
russian
had
been
answered
by
the
russian
and
suppose
the
answer
had
been
somewhat
as
follows
is
all
very
well
for
foreigners
to
complain
of
our
denying
civic
rights
to
our
jewish
subjects
but
we
know
the
jews
better
than
they
do
they
are
a
barbarous
people
entirely
primitive
and
very
like
the
simple
savages
who
can
not
count
beyond
five
on
their
fingers
it
is
quite
impossible
to
make
them
understand
ordinary
numbers
to
say
nothing
of
simple
economics
they
do
not
realise
the
meaning
or
the
value
of
money
no
jew
anywhere
in
the
world
can
get
into
his
stupid
head
the
notion
of
a
bargain
or
of
exchanging
one
thing
for
another
their
hopeless
incapacity
for
commerce
or
finance
would
retard
the
progress
of
our
people
would
prevent
the
spread
of
any
sort
of
economic
education
would
keep
the
whole
country
on
a
level
lower
than
that
of
the
most
prehistoric
methods
of
barter
what
russia
needs
most
is
a
mercantile
middle
class
and
it
is
unjust
to
ask
us
to
swamp
its
small
beginnings
in
thousands
of
these
rude
tribesmen
who
can
not
do
a
sum
of
simple
addition
or
understand
the
symbolic
character
of
a
threepenny
bit
we
might
as
well
be
asked
to
give
civic
rights
to
cows
and
pigs
as
to
this
unhappy
race
who
can
no
more
count
than
the
beasts
of
the
field
in
every
intellectual
exercise
they
are
hopelessly
incompetent
no
jew
can
play
chess
no
jew
can
learn
languages
no
jew
has
ever
appeared
in
the
smallest
part
in
any
theatrical
performance
no
jew
can
give
or
take
any
pleasure
connected
with
any
musical
instrument
these
people
are
our
subjects
and
we
understand
them
we
accept
full
responsibility
for
treating
such
troglodytes
on
our
own
terms
it
would
not
be
entirely
convincing
it
would
sound
a
little
and
unreal
but
it
would
sound
exactly
like
our
utterances
about
the
irish
as
they
sound
to
all
americans
and
rather
especially
to
americans
that
is
exactly
the
impression
we
produce
on
the
people
of
the
united
states
when
we
say
as
we
do
say
in
substance
something
like
this
mean
no
harm
to
the
poor
dear
irish
so
dreamy
so
irresponsible
so
incapable
of
order
or
organisation
if
we
were
to
withdraw
from
their
country
they
would
only
fight
among
themselves
they
have
no
notion
of
how
to
rule
themselves
there
is
something
charming
about
their
unpracticability
about
their
very
incapacity
for
the
coarse
business
of
politics
but
for
their
own
sakes
it
is
impossible
to
leave
these
emotional
visionaries
to
ruin
themselves
in
the
attempt
to
rule
themselves
they
are
like
children
but
they
are
our
own
children
and
we
understand
them
we
accept
full
responsibility
for
acting
as
their
parents
and
guardians
now
the
point
is
not
only
that
this
view
of
the
irish
is
false
but
that
it
is
the
particular
view
that
the
americans
know
to
be
false
while
we
are
saying
that
the
irish
could
not
organise
the
americans
are
complaining
often
very
bitterly
of
the
power
of
irish
organisation
while
we
say
that
the
irishman
could
not
rule
himself
the
americans
are
saying
more
or
less
humorously
that
the
irishman
rules
them
a
highly
intelligent
professor
said
to
me
in
boston
have
solved
the
irish
problem
here
we
have
an
entirely
independent
irish
government
while
we
are
complaining
in
an
almost
passionate
manner
of
the
impotence
of
mere
cliques
of
idealists
and
dreamers
they
are
complaining
often
in
a
very
indignant
manner
of
the
power
of
great
gangs
of
bosses
and
bullies
there
are
a
great
many
americans
who
pity
the
irish
very
naturally
and
very
rightly
for
the
historic
martyrdom
which
their
patriotism
has
endured
but
there
are
a
great
many
americans
who
do
not
pity
the
irish
in
the
least
they
would
be
much
more
likely
to
pity
the
english
only
this
particular
way
of
talking
tends
rather
to
make
them
despise
the
english
thus
both
the
friends
of
ireland
and
the
foes
of
ireland
tend
to
be
the
foes
of
england
we
make
one
set
of
enemies
by
our
action
and
another
by
our
apology
it
is
a
thing
that
can
from
time
to
time
be
found
in
history
a
misunderstanding
that
really
has
a
moral
the
english
excuse
would
carry
much
more
weight
if
it
had
more
sincerity
and
more
humility
there
are
a
considerable
number
of
people
in
the
united
states
who
could
sympathise
with
us
if
we
would
say
frankly
that
we
fear
the
irish
those
who
thus
despise
our
pity
might
possibly
even
respect
our
fear
the
argument
i
have
often
used
in
other
places
comes
back
with
prodigious
and
redoubled
force
after
hearing
anything
of
american
opinion
the
argument
that
the
only
reasonable
or
reputable
excuse
for
the
english
is
the
excuse
of
a
patriotic
sense
of
peril
and
that
the
unionist
if
he
must
be
a
unionist
should
use
that
and
no
other
when
the
unionist
has
said
that
he
dare
not
let
loose
against
himself
a
captive
he
has
so
cruelly
wronged
he
has
said
all
that
he
has
to
say
all
that
he
has
ever
had
to
say
all
that
he
will
ever
have
to
say
he
is
like
a
man
who
has
sent
a
virile
and
rather
vindictive
rival
unjustly
to
penal
servitude
and
who
connives
at
the
continuance
of
the
sentence
not
because
he
himself
is
particularly
vindictive
but
because
he
is
afraid
of
what
the
convict
will
do
when
he
comes
out
of
prison
this
is
not
exactly
a
moral
strength
but
it
is
a
very
human
weakness
and
that
is
the
most
that
can
be
said
for
it
all
other
talk
about
celtic
frenzy
or
catholic
superstition
is
cant
invented
to
deceive
himself
or
to
deceive
the
world
but
the
vital
point
to
realise
is
that
it
is
cant
that
can
not
possibly
deceive
the
american
world
in
the
matter
of
the
irishman
the
american
is
not
to
be
deceived
it
is
not
merely
true
to
say
that
he
knows
better
it
is
equally
true
to
say
that
he
knows
worse
he
knows
vices
and
evils
in
the
irishman
that
are
entirely
hidden
in
the
hazy
vision
of
the
englishman
he
knows
that
our
unreal
slanders
are
inconsistent
even
with
the
real
sins
to
us
ireland
is
a
shadowy
isle
of
sunset
like
atlantis
about
which
we
can
make
up
legends
to
him
it
is
a
positive
ward
or
parish
in
the
heart
of
his
huge
cities
like
whitechapel
about
which
even
we
can
not
make
legends
but
only
lies
and
as
i
have
said
there
are
some
lies
we
do
not
tell
even
about
whitechapel
we
do
not
say
it
is
inhabited
by
jews
too
stupid
to
count
or
know
the
value
of
a
coin
the
first
thing
for
any
honest
englishman
to
send
across
the
sea
is
this
that
the
english
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
notion
of
what
they
are
up
against
in
america
they
have
never
even
heard
of
the
batteries
of
almost
brutal
energy
of
which
i
had
thus
touched
a
live
wire
even
before
i
landed
people
talk
about
the
hypocrisy
of
england
in
dealing
with
a
small
nationality
what
strikes
me
is
the
stupidity
of
england
in
supposing
that
she
is
dealing
with
a
small
nationality
when
she
is
really
dealing
with
a
very
large
nationality
she
is
dealing
with
a
nationality
that
often
threatens
even
numerically
to
dominate
all
the
other
nationalities
of
the
united
states
the
irish
are
not
decaying
they
are
not
unpractical
they
are
scarcely
even
scattered
they
are
not
even
poor
they
are
the
most
powerful
and
practical
with
whom
we
can
decide
to
be
friends
or
foes
and
that
is
why
i
thought
first
of
that
still
and
solid
brown
house
in
buckinghamshire
standing
back
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
among
my
impressions
of
america
i
have
deliberately
put
first
the
figure
of
the
interviewer
standing
on
the
shore
more
symbolic
than
the
statue
of
liberty
the
irish
interviewer
importance
for
the
english
lay
in
the
fact
of
his
being
an
irishman
but
there
was
also
considerable
interest
in
the
circumstance
of
his
being
an
interviewer
and
as
certain
wild
birds
sometimes
wing
their
way
far
out
to
sea
and
are
the
first
signal
of
the
shore
so
the
first
americans
the
traveller
meets
are
often
american
interviewers
and
they
are
generally
birds
of
a
feather
and
they
certainly
flock
together
in
this
respect
there
is
a
slight
difference
in
the
etiquette
of
the
craft
in
the
two
countries
which
i
was
delighted
to
discuss
with
my
fellow
craftsmen
if
i
could
at
that
moment
have
flown
back
to
fleet
street
i
am
happy
to
reflect
that
nobody
in
the
world
would
in
the
least
wish
to
interview
me
i
should
attract
no
more
attention
than
the
stone
griffin
opposite
the
law
courts
both
monsters
being
grotesque
but
also
familiar
but
supposing
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
anybody
did
want
to
interview
me
it
is
fairly
certain
that
the
fact
of
one
paper
publishing
such
an
interview
would
rather
prevent
the
other
papers
from
doing
so
the
repetition
of
the
same
views
of
the
same
individual
in
two
places
would
be
considered
rather
bad
journalism
it
would
have
an
air
of
stolen
thunder
not
to
say
stage
thunder
but
in
america
the
fact
of
my
landing
and
lecturing
was
evidently
regarded
in
the
same
light
as
a
murder
or
a
great
fire
or
any
other
terrible
but
incurable
catastrophe
a
matter
of
interest
to
all
pressmen
concerned
with
practical
events
one
of
the
first
questions
i
was
asked
was
how
i
should
be
disposed
to
explain
the
wave
of
crime
in
new
york
naturally
i
replied
that
it
might
possibly
be
due
to
the
number
of
english
lecturers
who
had
recently
landed
in
the
mood
of
the
moment
it
seemed
possible
that
if
they
had
all
been
interviewed
regrettable
incidents
might
possibly
have
taken
place
but
this
was
only
the
mood
of
the
moment
and
even
as
a
mood
did
not
last
more
than
a
moment
and
since
it
has
reference
to
a
rather
common
and
a
rather
unjust
conception
of
american
journalism
i
think
it
well
to
take
it
first
as
a
fallacy
to
be
refuted
though
the
refutation
may
require
a
rather
longer
approach
i
have
generally
found
that
the
traveller
fails
to
understand
a
foreign
country
through
treating
it
as
a
tendency
and
not
as
a
balance
but
if
a
thing
were
always
tending
in
one
direction
it
would
soon
tend
to
destruction
everything
that
merely
progresses
finally
perishes
every
nation
like
every
family
exists
upon
a
compromise
and
commonly
a
rather
eccentric
compromise
using
the
word
in
the
sense
of
something
that
is
somehow
at
once
crazy
and
healthy
now
the
foreigner
commonly
sees
some
feature
that
he
thinks
fantastic
without
seeing
the
feature
that
balances
it
the
ordinary
examples
are
obvious
enough
an
englishman
dining
inside
a
hotel
on
the
boulevards
thinks
the
french
eccentric
in
refusing
to
open
a
window
but
he
does
not
think
the
english
eccentric
in
refusing
to
carry
their
chairs
and
tables
out
on
to
the
pavement
in
ludgate
circus
an
englishman
will
go
poking
about
in
little
swiss
or
italian
villages
in
wild
mountains
or
in
remote
islands
demanding
tea
and
never
reflects
that
he
is
like
a
chinaman
who
should
enter
all
the
wayside
in
kent
and
sussex
and
demand
opium
but
the
point
is
not
merely
that
he
demands
what
he
can
not
expect
to
enjoy
it
is
that
he
ignores
even
what
he
does
enjoy
he
does
not
realise
the
sublime
and
starry
paradox
of
the
phrase
which
to
him
should
be
a
glorious
jest
like
the
phrase
gold
or
diamonds
these
are
the
simple
and
cases
but
there
are
many
more
subtle
cases
of
the
same
thing
of
the
tendency
to
see
that
the
nation
fills
up
its
own
gap
with
its
own
substitute
or
corrects
its
own
extravagance
with
its
own
precaution
the
national
antidote
generally
grows
wild
in
the
woods
side
by
side
with
the
national
poison
if
it
did
not
all
the
natives
would
be
dead
for
it
is
so
as
i
have
said
that
nations
necessarily
die
of
the
undiluted
poison
called
progress
it
is
so
in
this
and
example
of
the
american
journalist
the
american
interviewers
really
have
exceedingly
good
manners
for
the
purposes
of
their
trade
granted
that
it
is
necessary
to
pursue
their
trade
and
even
what
is
called
their
hustling
method
can
truly
be
said
to
cut
both
ways
or
hustle
both
ways
for
if
they
hustle
in
they
also
hustle
out
it
may
not
at
first
sight
seem
the
very
warmest
compliment
to
a
gentleman
to
congratulate
him
on
the
fact
that
he
soon
goes
away
but
it
really
is
a
tribute
to
his
perfection
in
a
very
delicate
social
art
and
i
am
quite
serious
when
i
say
that
in
this
respect
the
interviewers
are
artists
it
might
be
more
difficult
for
an
englishman
to
come
to
the
point
particularly
the
sort
of
point
which
american
journalists
are
supposed
with
some
exaggeration
to
aim
at
it
might
be
more
difficult
for
an
englishman
to
ask
a
total
stranger
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
for
the
exact
inscription
on
his
mother
grave
but
i
really
think
that
if
an
englishman
once
got
so
far
as
that
he
would
go
very
much
farther
and
certainly
go
on
very
much
longer
the
englishman
would
approach
the
churchyard
by
a
rather
more
wandering
woodland
path
but
if
once
he
had
got
to
the
grave
i
think
he
would
have
much
more
disposition
so
to
speak
to
sit
down
on
it
our
own
national
temperament
would
find
it
decidedly
more
difficult
to
disconnect
when
connections
had
really
been
established
possibly
that
is
the
reason
why
our
national
temperament
does
not
establish
them
i
suspect
that
the
real
reason
that
an
englishman
does
not
talk
is
that
he
can
not
leave
off
talking
i
suspect
that
my
solitary
countrymen
hiding
in
separate
railway
compartments
are
not
so
much
retiring
as
a
race
of
trappists
as
escaping
from
a
race
of
talkers
however
this
may
be
there
is
obviously
something
of
practical
advantage
in
the
ease
with
which
the
american
butterfly
flits
from
flower
to
flower
he
may
in
a
sense
force
his
acquaintance
on
us
but
he
does
not
force
himself
on
us
even
when
to
our
prejudices
he
seems
to
insist
on
knowing
us
at
least
he
does
not
insist
on
our
knowing
him
it
may
be
to
some
sensibilities
a
bad
thing
that
a
total
stranger
should
talk
as
if
he
were
a
friend
but
it
might
possibly
be
worse
if
he
insisted
on
being
a
friend
before
he
would
talk
like
one
to
a
great
deal
of
the
interviewing
indeed
much
the
greater
part
of
it
even
this
criticism
does
not
apply
there
is
nothing
which
even
an
englishman
of
extreme
sensibility
could
regard
as
particularly
private
the
questions
involved
are
generally
entirely
public
and
treated
with
not
a
little
public
spirit
but
my
only
reason
for
saying
here
what
can
be
said
even
for
the
worst
exceptions
is
to
point
out
this
general
and
neglected
principle
that
the
very
thing
that
we
complain
of
in
a
foreigner
generally
carries
with
it
its
own
foreign
cure
american
interviewing
is
generally
very
reasonable
and
it
is
always
very
rapid
and
even
those
to
whom
talking
to
an
intelligent
fellow
creature
is
as
horrible
as
having
a
tooth
out
may
still
admit
that
american
interviewing
has
many
of
the
qualities
of
american
dentistry
another
effect
that
has
given
rise
to
this
fallacy
this
exaggeration
of
the
vulgarity
and
curiosity
of
the
press
is
the
distinction
between
the
articles
and
the
headlines
or
rather
the
tendency
to
ignore
that
distinction
the
few
really
untrue
and
unscrupulous
things
i
have
seen
in
american
have
always
been
in
the
headlines
and
the
headlines
are
written
by
somebody
else
some
solitary
and
savage
cynic
locked
up
in
the
office
hating
all
mankind
and
raging
and
revenging
himself
at
random
while
the
neat
polite
and
rational
pressman
can
safely
be
let
loose
to
wander
about
the
town
for
instance
i
talked
to
two
decidedly
thoughtful
fellow
journalists
immediately
on
my
arrival
at
a
town
in
which
there
had
been
some
labour
troubles
i
told
them
my
general
view
of
labour
in
the
very
largest
and
perhaps
the
vaguest
historical
outline
pointing
out
that
the
one
great
truth
to
be
taught
to
the
middle
classes
was
that
capitalism
was
itself
a
crisis
and
a
passing
crisis
that
it
was
not
so
much
that
it
was
breaking
down
as
that
it
had
never
really
stood
up
slaveries
could
last
and
peasantries
could
last
but
communities
could
hardly
even
live
and
were
already
dying
all
this
moral
and
even
metaphysical
generalisation
was
most
fairly
and
most
faithfully
reproduced
by
the
interviewer
who
had
actually
heard
it
casually
and
idly
spoken
but
on
the
top
of
this
column
of
political
philosophy
was
the
extraordinary
announcement
in
enormous
letters
takes
sides
in
trolley
strike
this
was
inaccurate
when
i
spoke
i
not
only
did
not
know
that
there
was
any
trolley
strike
but
i
did
not
know
what
a
trolley
strike
was
i
should
have
had
an
indistinct
idea
that
a
large
number
of
citizens
earned
their
living
by
carrying
things
about
in
and
that
they
had
desisted
from
the
beneficent
activities
any
one
who
did
not
happen
to
be
a
journalist
or
know
a
little
about
journalism
american
and
english
would
have
supposed
that
the
same
man
who
wrote
the
article
had
suddenly
gone
mad
and
written
the
title
but
i
know
that
we
have
here
to
deal
with
two
different
types
of
journalists
and
the
man
who
writes
the
headlines
i
will
not
dare
to
describe
for
i
have
not
seen
him
except
in
dreams
another
innocent
complication
is
that
the
interviewer
does
sometimes
translate
things
into
his
native
language
it
would
not
seem
odd
that
a
french
interviewer
should
translate
them
into
french
and
it
is
certain
that
the
american
interviewer
sometimes
translates
them
into
american
those
who
imagine
the
two
languages
to
be
the
same
are
more
innocent
than
any
interviewer
to
take
one
out
of
the
twenty
examples
some
of
which
i
have
mentioned
elsewhere
suppose
an
interviewer
had
said
that
i
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
nut
i
should
be
flattered
but
faintly
surprised
at
such
a
tribute
to
my
dress
and
dashing
exterior
i
should
afterwards
be
sobered
and
enlightened
by
discovering
that
in
america
a
nut
does
not
mean
a
dandy
but
a
defective
or
imbecile
person
and
as
i
have
here
to
translate
their
american
phrase
into
english
it
may
be
very
defensible
that
they
should
translate
my
english
phrases
into
american
anyhow
they
often
do
translate
them
into
american
in
answer
to
the
usual
question
about
prohibition
i
had
made
the
usual
answer
obvious
to
the
point
of
dullness
to
those
who
are
in
daily
contact
with
it
that
it
is
a
law
that
the
rich
make
knowing
they
can
always
break
it
from
the
printed
interview
it
appeared
that
i
had
said
all
matter
of
dollar
sign
this
is
almost
avowed
translation
like
a
french
translation
nobody
can
suppose
that
it
would
come
natural
to
an
englishman
to
talk
about
a
dollar
still
less
about
a
dollar
sign
whatever
that
may
be
it
is
exactly
as
if
he
had
made
me
talk
about
the
skelt
and
stevenson
toy
theatre
as
cent
plain
and
two
cents
coloured
or
condemned
a
parsimonious
policy
as
and
another
interviewer
once
asked
me
who
was
the
greatest
american
writer
i
have
forgotten
exactly
what
i
said
but
after
mentioning
several
names
i
said
that
the
greatest
natural
genius
and
artistic
force
was
probably
walt
whitman
the
printed
interview
is
more
precise
and
students
of
my
literary
and
conversational
style
will
be
interested
to
know
that
i
said
here
walt
whitman
was
your
one
real
man
here
again
i
hardly
think
the
translation
can
have
been
quite
unconscious
most
of
my
intimates
are
indeed
aware
that
i
do
not
talk
like
that
but
i
fancy
that
the
same
fact
would
have
dawned
on
the
journalist
to
whom
i
had
been
talking
and
even
this
trivial
point
carries
with
it
the
two
truths
which
must
be
i
fear
the
rather
monotonous
moral
of
these
pages
the
first
is
that
america
and
england
can
be
far
better
friends
when
sharply
divided
than
when
shapelessly
amalgamated
these
two
journalists
were
false
reporters
but
they
were
true
translators
they
were
not
so
much
interviewers
as
interpreters
and
the
second
is
that
in
any
such
difference
it
is
often
wholesome
to
look
beneath
the
surface
for
a
superiority
for
ability
to
translate
does
imply
ability
to
understand
and
many
of
these
journalists
really
did
understand
i
think
there
are
many
english
journalists
who
would
be
more
puzzled
by
so
simple
an
idea
as
the
plutocratic
foundation
of
prohibition
but
the
american
knew
at
once
that
i
meant
it
was
a
matter
of
dollar
sign
probably
because
he
knew
very
well
that
it
is
then
again
there
is
a
curious
convention
by
which
american
interviewing
makes
itself
out
much
worse
than
it
is
the
reports
are
far
more
rowdy
and
insolent
than
the
conversations
this
is
probably
a
part
of
the
fact
that
a
certain
vivacity
which
to
some
seems
vitality
and
to
some
vulgarity
is
not
only
an
ambition
but
an
ideal
it
must
always
be
grasped
that
this
vulgarity
is
an
ideal
even
more
than
it
is
a
reality
it
is
an
ideal
when
it
is
not
a
reality
a
very
quiet
and
intelligent
young
man
in
a
soft
black
hat
and
spectacles
will
ask
for
an
interview
with
unimpeachable
politeness
wait
for
his
living
subject
with
unimpeachable
patience
talk
to
him
quite
sensibly
for
twenty
minutes
and
go
noiselessly
away
then
in
the
newspaper
next
morning
you
will
read
how
he
beat
the
bedroom
door
in
and
pursued
his
victim
on
to
the
roof
or
dragged
him
from
under
the
bed
and
tore
from
him
replies
to
all
sorts
of
bald
and
ruthless
questions
printed
in
large
black
letters
i
was
often
interviewed
in
the
evening
and
had
no
notion
of
how
atrociously
i
had
been
insulted
till
i
saw
it
in
the
paper
next
morning
i
had
no
notion
i
had
been
on
the
rack
of
an
inquisitor
until
i
saw
it
in
plain
print
and
then
of
course
i
believed
it
with
a
faith
and
docility
unknown
in
any
previous
epoch
of
history
an
interesting
essay
might
be
written
upon
points
upon
which
nations
affect
more
vices
than
they
possess
and
it
might
deal
more
fully
with
the
american
pressman
who
is
a
harmless
clubman
in
private
and
becomes
a
sort
of
in
print
i
have
turned
this
chapter
into
something
like
a
defence
of
interviewers
because
i
really
think
they
are
made
to
bear
too
much
of
the
burden
of
the
bad
developments
of
modern
journalism
but
i
am
very
far
from
meaning
to
suggest
that
those
bad
developments
are
not
very
bad
so
far
from
wishing
to
minimise
the
evil
i
would
in
a
real
sense
rather
magnify
it
i
would
suggest
that
the
evil
itself
is
a
much
larger
and
more
fundamental
thing
and
that
to
deal
with
it
by
abusing
poor
journalists
doing
their
particular
and
perhaps
peculiar
duty
is
like
dealing
with
a
pestilence
by
rubbing
at
one
of
the
spots
what
is
wrong
with
the
modern
world
will
not
be
righted
by
attributing
the
whole
disease
to
each
of
its
symptoms
in
turn
first
to
the
tavern
and
then
to
the
cinema
and
then
to
the
reporter
room
the
evil
of
journalism
is
not
in
the
journalists
it
is
not
in
the
poor
men
on
the
lower
level
of
the
profession
but
in
the
rich
men
at
the
top
of
the
profession
or
rather
in
the
rich
men
who
are
too
much
on
top
of
the
profession
even
to
belong
to
it
the
trouble
with
newspapers
is
the
newspaper
trust
as
the
trouble
might
be
with
a
wheat
trust
without
involving
a
vilification
of
all
the
people
who
grow
wheat
it
is
the
american
plutocracy
and
not
the
american
press
what
is
the
matter
with
the
modern
world
is
not
modern
headlines
or
modern
films
or
modern
machinery
what
is
the
matter
with
the
modern
world
is
the
modern
world
and
the
cure
will
come
from
another
american
there
is
one
point
almost
to
be
called
a
paradox
to
be
noted
about
new
york
and
that
is
that
in
one
sense
it
is
really
new
the
term
very
seldom
has
any
relevance
to
the
reality
the
new
forest
is
nearly
as
old
as
the
conquest
and
the
new
theology
is
nearly
as
old
as
the
creed
things
have
been
offered
to
me
as
the
new
thought
that
might
more
properly
be
called
the
old
thoughtlessness
and
the
thing
we
call
the
new
poor
law
is
already
old
enough
to
know
better
but
there
is
a
sense
in
which
new
york
is
always
new
in
the
sense
that
it
is
always
being
renewed
a
stranger
might
well
say
that
the
chief
industry
of
the
citizens
consists
of
destroying
their
city
but
he
soon
realises
that
they
always
start
it
all
over
again
with
undiminished
energy
and
hope
at
first
i
had
a
fancy
that
they
never
quite
finished
putting
up
a
big
building
without
feeling
that
it
was
time
to
pull
it
down
again
and
that
somebody
began
to
dig
up
the
first
foundations
while
somebody
else
was
putting
on
the
last
tiles
this
fills
the
whole
of
this
brilliant
and
bewildering
place
with
a
quite
unique
and
unparalleled
air
of
rapid
ruin
ruins
spring
up
so
suddenly
like
mushrooms
which
with
us
are
the
growth
of
age
like
mosses
that
one
half
expects
to
see
ivy
climbing
quickly
up
the
broken
walls
as
in
the
nightmare
of
the
time
machine
or
in
some
incredibly
accelerated
cinema
there
is
no
sight
in
any
country
that
raises
my
own
spirits
so
much
as
a
scaffolding
it
is
a
tragedy
that
they
always
take
the
scaffolding
away
and
leave
us
nothing
but
a
mere
building
if
they
would
only
take
the
building
away
and
leave
us
a
beautiful
scaffolding
it
would
in
most
cases
be
a
gain
to
the
loveliness
of
earth
if
i
could
analyse
what
it
is
that
lifts
the
heart
about
the
lightness
and
clarity
of
such
a
white
and
wooden
skeleton
i
could
explain
what
it
is
that
is
really
charming
about
new
york
in
spite
of
its
suffering
from
the
curse
of
cosmopolitanism
and
even
the
provincial
superstition
of
progress
it
is
partly
that
all
this
destruction
and
reconstruction
is
an
unexhausted
artistic
energy
but
it
is
partly
also
that
it
is
an
artistic
energy
that
does
not
take
itself
too
seriously
it
is
first
because
man
is
here
a
carpenter
and
secondly
because
he
is
a
stage
carpenter
indeed
there
is
about
the
whole
scene
the
spirit
of
it
therefore
touches
whatever
nerve
in
us
has
since
childhood
thrilled
at
all
theatrical
things
but
the
picture
will
be
imperfect
unless
we
realise
something
which
gives
it
unity
and
marks
its
chief
difference
from
the
climate
and
colours
of
western
europe
we
may
say
that
the
remains
the
same
the
sky
remained
and
in
the
depths
of
winter
it
seemed
to
be
blue
with
summer
and
so
clear
that
i
almost
flattered
myself
that
clouds
were
english
products
like
primroses
an
american
would
probably
retort
on
my
charge
of
by
saying
that
at
least
he
only
shifted
the
towers
and
domes
of
the
earth
and
that
in
england
it
is
the
heavens
that
are
shifty
and
indeed
we
have
changes
from
day
to
day
that
would
seem
to
him
as
distinct
as
different
slides
one
view
showing
the
bay
of
naples
and
the
next
the
north
pole
i
do
not
mean
of
course
that
there
are
no
changes
in
american
weather
but
as
a
matter
of
proportion
it
is
true
that
the
most
unstable
part
of
our
scenery
is
the
most
stable
part
of
theirs
indeed
we
might
almost
be
pardoned
the
boast
that
britain
alone
really
possesses
the
noble
thing
called
weather
most
other
countries
having
to
be
content
with
climate
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
they
often
are
content
with
it
and
the
beauty
of
new
york
which
is
considerable
is
very
largely
due
to
the
clarity
that
brings
out
the
colours
of
varied
buildings
against
the
equal
colour
of
the
sky
strangely
enough
i
found
myself
repeating
about
this
vista
of
the
west
two
vivid
lines
in
which
yeats
has
called
up
a
vision
of
the
east
and
coloured
like
the
eastern
birds
at
evening
in
their
rainless
skies
to
invoke
a
somewhat
less
poetic
parallel
even
the
untravelled
englishman
has
probably
seen
american
posters
and
trade
advertisements
of
a
patchy
and
gaudy
kind
in
which
a
white
house
or
a
yellow
are
cut
out
as
in
cardboard
against
a
sky
like
blue
marble
i
used
to
think
it
was
only
new
art
but
i
found
that
it
is
really
new
york
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
the
very
nature
of
local
character
has
gained
the
nickname
of
local
colour
colour
runs
through
all
our
experience
and
we
all
know
that
our
childhood
found
talismanic
gems
in
the
very
paints
in
the
or
even
in
their
very
names
and
just
as
the
very
name
of
lake
really
suggested
to
me
some
sanguine
and
mysterious
mere
dark
yet
red
as
blood
so
the
very
name
of
sienna
became
afterwards
tangled
up
in
my
mind
with
the
notion
of
something
traditional
and
tragic
as
if
some
such
golden
italian
city
had
really
been
darkened
by
many
conflagrations
in
the
wars
of
mediaeval
democracy
now
if
one
had
the
caprice
of
conceiving
some
city
exactly
contrary
to
one
thus
seared
and
seasoned
by
fire
its
colour
might
be
called
up
to
a
childish
fancy
by
the
mere
name
of
umber
and
such
a
city
is
new
york
i
used
to
be
puzzled
by
the
name
of
umber
being
unable
to
imagine
the
effect
of
fried
umber
or
stewed
umber
but
the
colours
of
new
york
are
exactly
in
that
key
and
might
be
adumbrated
by
phrases
like
raw
pink
or
raw
yellow
it
is
really
in
a
sense
like
something
uncooked
or
something
which
the
satiric
would
call
and
yet
the
effect
is
not
only
beautiful
it
is
even
delicate
i
had
no
name
for
this
nuance
until
i
saw
that
somebody
had
written
of
towers
of
new
york
and
i
knew
that
the
name
had
been
found
there
are
no
paints
dry
enough
to
describe
all
that
dry
light
and
it
is
not
a
box
of
colours
but
of
crayons
if
the
englishman
returning
to
england
is
moved
at
the
sight
of
a
block
of
white
chalk
the
american
sees
rather
a
bundle
of
chalks
nor
can
i
imagine
anything
more
moving
fairy
tales
are
told
to
children
about
a
country
where
the
trees
are
like
and
the
lakes
like
treacle
but
most
children
would
feel
almost
as
greedy
for
a
fairyland
where
the
trees
were
like
brushes
of
green
paint
and
the
hills
were
of
coloured
chalks
but
here
what
accentuates
this
arid
freshness
is
the
fragmentary
look
of
the
continual
reconstruction
and
change
the
strong
daylight
finds
everywhere
the
broken
edges
of
things
and
the
sort
of
hues
we
see
in
earth
or
the
white
sections
of
trees
and
it
is
in
this
respect
that
the
local
colour
can
literally
be
taken
as
local
character
for
new
york
considered
in
itself
is
primarily
a
place
of
unrest
and
those
who
sincerely
love
it
as
many
do
love
it
for
the
romance
of
its
restlessness
a
man
almost
looks
at
a
building
as
he
passes
to
wonder
whether
it
will
be
there
when
he
comes
back
from
his
walk
and
the
doubt
is
part
of
an
indescribable
notion
as
of
a
white
nightmare
of
daylight
which
is
increased
by
the
very
numbering
of
the
streets
with
its
tangle
of
numerals
which
at
first
makes
an
english
head
reel
the
detail
is
merely
a
symbol
and
when
he
is
used
to
it
he
can
see
that
it
is
like
the
most
humdrum
human
customs
both
worse
and
better
than
his
own
west
street
is
the
easiest
of
all
addresses
to
find
but
the
hardest
of
all
addresses
to
remember
he
who
is
like
myself
so
constituted
as
necessarily
to
lose
any
piece
of
paper
he
has
particular
reason
to
preserve
will
find
himself
wishing
the
place
were
called
crest
or
crag
like
any
unobtrusive
villa
in
streatham
but
his
sense
of
some
sort
of
incalculable
calculations
as
of
the
vision
of
a
mad
mathematician
is
rooted
in
a
more
real
impression
his
first
feeling
that
his
head
is
turning
round
is
due
to
something
really
dizzy
in
the
movement
of
a
life
that
turns
dizzily
like
a
wheel
if
there
be
in
the
modern
mind
something
paradoxical
that
can
find
peace
in
change
it
is
here
that
it
has
indeed
built
its
habitation
or
rather
is
still
building
and
unbuilding
it
one
might
fancy
that
it
changes
in
everything
and
that
nothing
endures
but
its
invisible
name
and
even
its
name
as
i
have
said
seems
to
make
a
boast
of
novelty
that
is
something
like
a
sincere
first
impression
of
the
atmosphere
of
new
york
those
who
think
that
is
the
atmosphere
of
america
have
never
got
any
farther
than
new
york
we
might
almost
say
that
they
have
never
entered
america
any
more
than
if
they
had
been
detained
like
undesirable
aliens
at
ellis
island
and
indeed
there
are
a
good
many
undesirable
aliens
detained
in
manhattan
island
too
but
of
that
i
will
not
speak
being
myself
an
alien
with
no
particular
pretensions
to
be
desirable
anyhow
such
is
new
york
but
such
is
not
the
new
world
the
great
american
republic
contains
very
considerable
varieties
and
of
these
varieties
i
necessarily
saw
far
too
little
to
allow
me
to
generalise
but
from
the
little
i
did
see
i
should
venture
on
the
generalisation
that
the
great
part
of
america
is
singularly
and
even
strikingly
unlike
new
york
it
goes
without
saying
that
new
york
is
very
unlike
the
vast
agricultural
plains
and
small
agricultural
towns
of
the
middle
west
which
i
did
see
it
may
be
conjectured
with
some
confidence
that
it
is
very
unlike
what
is
called
the
wild
and
sometimes
the
woolly
west
which
i
did
not
see
but
i
am
here
comparing
new
york
not
with
the
newer
states
of
the
prairie
or
the
mountains
but
with
the
other
older
cities
of
the
atlantic
coast
and
new
york
as
it
seems
to
me
is
quite
vitally
different
from
the
other
historic
cities
of
america
it
is
so
different
that
it
shows
them
all
for
the
moment
in
a
false
light
as
a
long
white
searchlight
will
throw
a
light
that
is
fantastic
and
theatrical
upon
ancient
and
quiet
villages
folded
in
the
everlasting
hills
philadelphia
and
boston
and
baltimore
are
more
like
those
quiet
villages
than
they
are
like
new
york
if
i
were
to
call
this
book
antiquities
of
america
i
should
give
rise
to
misunderstanding
and
possibly
to
annoyance
and
yet
the
double
sense
in
such
words
is
an
undeserved
misfortune
for
them
we
talk
of
plato
or
the
parthenon
or
the
greek
passion
for
beauty
as
parts
of
the
antique
but
hardly
of
the
antiquated
when
we
call
them
ancient
it
is
not
because
they
have
perished
but
rather
because
they
have
survived
in
the
same
way
i
heard
some
new
yorkers
refer
to
philadelphia
or
baltimore
as
towns
they
mean
by
a
dead
town
a
town
that
has
had
the
impudence
not
to
die
such
people
are
astonished
to
find
an
ancient
thing
alive
just
as
they
are
now
astonished
and
will
be
increasingly
astonished
to
find
poland
or
the
papacy
or
the
french
nation
still
alive
and
what
i
mean
by
philadelphia
and
baltimore
being
alive
is
precisely
what
these
people
mean
by
their
being
dead
it
is
continuity
it
is
the
presence
of
the
life
first
breathed
into
them
and
of
the
purpose
of
their
being
it
is
the
benediction
of
the
founders
of
the
colonies
and
the
fathers
of
the
republic
this
tradition
is
truly
to
be
called
life
for
life
alone
can
link
the
past
and
the
future
it
merely
means
that
as
what
was
done
yesterday
makes
some
difference
so
what
is
done
will
make
some
difference
in
new
york
it
is
difficult
to
feel
that
any
day
will
make
any
difference
these
moderns
only
die
daily
without
power
to
rise
from
the
dead
but
i
can
truly
claim
that
in
coming
into
some
of
these
more
stable
cities
of
the
states
i
felt
something
quite
sincerely
of
that
historic
emotion
which
is
satisfied
in
the
eternal
cities
of
the
mediterranean
i
felt
in
america
what
many
americans
suppose
can
only
be
felt
in
europe
i
have
seldom
had
that
sentiment
stirred
more
simply
and
directly
than
when
i
saw
from
afar
off
above
the
vast
grey
labyrinth
of
philadelphia
great
penn
upon
his
pinnacle
like
the
graven
figure
of
a
god
who
had
fashioned
a
new
world
and
remembered
that
his
body
lay
buried
in
a
field
at
the
turning
of
a
lane
a
league
from
my
own
door
for
this
aspect
of
america
is
rather
neglected
in
the
talk
about
electricity
and
headlines
needless
to
say
the
modern
vulgarity
of
avarice
and
advertisement
sprawls
all
over
philadelphia
or
boston
but
so
it
does
over
winchester
or
canterbury
but
most
people
know
that
there
is
something
else
to
be
found
in
canterbury
or
winchester
many
people
know
that
it
is
rather
more
interesting
and
some
people
know
that
alfred
can
still
walk
in
winchester
and
that
thomas
at
canterbury
was
killed
but
did
not
die
it
is
at
least
as
possible
for
a
philadelphian
to
feel
the
presence
of
penn
and
franklin
as
for
an
englishman
to
see
the
ghosts
of
alfred
and
of
becket
tradition
does
not
mean
a
dead
town
it
does
not
mean
that
the
living
are
dead
but
that
the
dead
are
alive
it
means
that
it
still
matters
what
penn
did
two
hundred
years
ago
or
what
franklin
did
a
hundred
years
ago
i
never
could
feel
in
new
york
that
it
mattered
what
anybody
did
an
hour
ago
and
these
things
did
and
do
matter
quakerism
is
not
my
favourite
creed
but
on
that
day
when
william
penn
stood
unarmed
upon
that
spot
and
made
his
treaty
with
the
red
indians
his
creed
of
humanity
did
have
a
triumph
and
a
triumph
that
has
not
turned
back
the
praise
given
to
him
is
not
a
priggish
fiction
of
our
conventional
history
though
such
fictions
have
illogically
curtailed
it
the
nonconformists
have
been
rather
unfair
to
penn
even
in
picking
their
praises
and
they
generally
forget
that
toleration
cuts
both
ways
and
that
an
open
mind
is
open
on
all
sides
those
who
deify
him
for
consenting
to
bargain
with
the
savages
can
not
forgive
him
for
consenting
to
bargain
with
the
stuarts
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
other
city
yet
more
closely
connected
with
the
tolerant
experiment
of
the
stuarts
the
state
of
maryland
was
the
first
experiment
in
religious
freedom
in
human
history
lord
baltimore
and
his
catholics
were
a
long
march
ahead
of
william
penn
and
his
quakers
on
what
is
now
called
the
path
of
progress
that
the
first
religious
toleration
ever
granted
in
the
world
was
granted
by
roman
catholics
is
one
of
those
little
informing
details
with
which
our
victorian
histories
did
not
exactly
teem
but
when
i
went
into
my
hotel
at
baltimore
and
found
two
priests
waiting
to
see
me
i
was
moved
in
a
new
fashion
for
i
felt
that
i
touched
the
end
of
a
living
chain
nor
was
the
impression
accidental
it
will
always
remain
with
me
with
a
mixture
of
gratitude
and
grief
for
they
brought
a
message
of
welcome
from
a
great
american
whose
name
i
had
known
from
childhood
and
whose
career
was
drawing
to
its
close
for
it
was
but
a
few
days
after
i
left
the
city
that
i
learned
that
cardinal
gibbons
was
dead
on
the
top
of
a
hill
on
one
side
of
the
town
stood
the
first
monument
raised
after
the
revolution
to
washington
beyond
it
was
a
new
monument
saluting
in
the
name
of
lafayette
the
american
soldiers
who
fell
fighting
in
france
in
the
great
war
between
them
were
steps
and
stone
seats
and
i
sat
down
on
one
of
them
and
talked
to
two
children
who
were
clambering
about
the
bases
of
the
monument
i
felt
a
profound
and
radiant
peace
in
the
thought
that
they
at
any
rate
were
not
going
to
my
lecture
it
made
me
happy
that
in
that
talk
neither
they
nor
i
had
any
names
i
was
full
of
that
indescribable
waking
vision
of
the
strangeness
of
life
and
especially
of
the
strangeness
of
locality
of
how
we
find
places
and
lose
them
and
see
faces
for
a
moment
in
a
land
and
it
is
equally
mysterious
if
we
remember
and
mysterious
if
we
forget
i
had
even
stirring
in
my
head
the
suggestion
of
some
verses
that
i
shall
never
finish
if
i
ever
go
back
to
baltimore
the
city
of
maryland
but
the
poem
would
have
to
contain
far
too
much
for
i
was
thinking
of
a
thousand
things
at
once
and
wondering
what
the
children
would
be
like
twenty
years
after
and
whether
they
would
travel
in
white
goods
or
be
interested
in
oil
and
i
was
not
untouched
it
may
be
said
by
the
fact
that
a
neighbouring
shop
had
provided
the
only
sample
of
the
substance
called
ever
found
on
the
american
continent
and
in
front
of
me
soared
up
into
the
sky
on
wings
of
stone
the
column
of
all
those
high
hopes
of
humanity
a
hundred
years
ago
and
beyond
there
were
lighted
candles
in
the
chapels
and
prayers
in
the
where
perhaps
already
a
prince
of
the
church
was
dying
only
on
a
later
page
can
i
even
attempt
to
comb
out
such
a
tangle
of
contrasts
which
is
indeed
the
tangle
of
america
and
this
mortal
life
but
sitting
there
on
that
stone
seat
under
that
quiet
sky
i
had
some
experience
of
the
thronging
thousands
of
living
thoughts
and
things
noisy
and
numberless
as
birds
that
give
its
everlasting
vivacity
and
vitality
to
a
dead
town
two
other
cities
i
visited
which
have
this
particular
type
of
traditional
character
the
one
being
typical
of
the
north
and
the
other
of
the
south
at
least
i
may
take
as
convenient
the
towns
of
boston
and
louis
and
we
might
add
nashville
as
being
a
shade
more
truly
southern
than
louis
to
the
extreme
south
in
the
sense
of
what
is
called
the
black
belt
i
never
went
at
all
now
english
travellers
expect
the
south
to
be
somewhat
traditional
but
they
are
not
prepared
for
the
aspects
of
boston
in
the
north
which
are
even
more
so
if
we
wished
only
for
an
antic
of
antithesis
we
might
say
that
on
one
side
the
places
are
more
prosaic
than
the
names
and
on
the
other
the
names
are
more
prosaic
than
the
places
louis
is
a
fine
town
and
we
recognise
a
fine
instinct
of
the
imagination
that
set
on
the
hill
overlooking
the
river
the
statue
of
that
holy
horseman
who
has
christened
the
city
but
the
city
is
not
as
beautiful
as
its
name
it
could
not
be
indeed
these
titles
set
up
a
standard
to
which
the
most
splendid
spires
and
turrets
could
not
rise
and
below
which
the
commercial
chimneys
and
conspicuously
sink
we
should
think
it
odd
if
belfast
had
borne
the
name
of
joan
of
arc
we
should
be
slightly
shocked
if
the
town
of
johannesburg
happened
to
be
called
jesus
christ
but
few
have
noted
a
blasphemy
or
even
a
somewhat
challenging
benediction
to
be
found
in
the
very
name
of
san
francisco
but
on
the
other
hand
a
place
like
boston
is
much
more
beautiful
than
its
name
and
as
i
have
suggested
an
englishman
general
information
or
lack
of
information
leaves
him
in
some
ignorance
of
the
type
of
beauty
that
turns
up
in
that
type
of
place
he
has
heard
so
much
about
the
purely
commercial
north
as
against
the
agricultural
and
aristocratic
south
and
the
traditions
of
boston
and
philadelphia
are
rather
too
tenuous
and
delicate
to
be
seen
from
across
the
atlantic
but
here
also
there
are
traditions
and
a
great
deal
of
traditionalism
the
circle
of
old
families
which
still
meets
with
a
certain
exclusiveness
in
philadelphia
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
we
in
england
should
expect
to
find
rather
in
new
orleans
the
academic
aristocracy
of
boston
which
oliver
wendell
holmes
called
the
brahmins
is
still
a
reality
though
it
was
always
a
minority
and
is
now
a
very
small
minority
an
epigram
invented
by
yale
at
the
expense
of
harvard
describes
it
as
very
small
indeed
here
is
to
jolly
old
boston
the
home
of
the
bean
and
the
cod
where
cabots
speak
only
to
lowells
and
lowells
speak
only
to
god
but
an
aristocracy
must
be
a
minority
and
it
is
arguable
that
the
smaller
it
is
the
better
i
am
bound
to
say
however
that
the
distinguished
cabot
the
present
representative
of
the
family
broke
through
any
taboo
that
may
tie
his
affections
to
his
creator
and
to
miss
amy
lowell
and
broadened
his
sympathies
so
indiscriminately
as
to
show
kindness
and
hospitality
to
so
lost
a
being
as
an
english
lecturer
but
if
the
thing
is
hardly
a
limit
it
is
very
living
as
a
memory
and
boston
on
this
side
is
very
much
a
place
of
memories
it
would
be
paying
it
a
very
poor
compliment
merely
to
say
that
parts
of
it
reminded
me
of
england
for
indeed
they
reminded
me
of
english
things
that
have
largely
vanished
from
england
there
are
old
brown
houses
in
the
corners
of
squares
and
streets
that
are
like
glimpses
of
a
man
forgotten
childhood
and
when
i
saw
the
long
path
with
posts
where
the
autocrat
may
be
supposed
to
have
walked
with
the
schoolmistress
i
felt
i
had
come
to
the
land
where
old
tales
come
true
i
pause
in
this
place
upon
this
particular
aspect
of
america
because
it
is
very
much
missed
in
a
mere
contrast
with
england
i
need
not
say
that
if
i
felt
it
even
about
slight
figures
of
fiction
i
felt
it
even
more
about
solid
figures
of
history
such
ghosts
seemed
particularly
solid
in
the
southern
states
precisely
because
of
the
comparative
quietude
and
leisure
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
south
it
was
never
more
vivid
to
me
than
when
coming
in
at
a
quiet
hour
of
the
night
into
the
comparatively
quiet
hotel
at
nashville
in
tennessee
and
mounting
to
a
dim
and
deserted
upper
floor
where
i
found
myself
before
a
faded
picture
and
from
the
dark
canvas
looked
forth
the
face
of
andrew
jackson
watchful
like
a
white
eagle
at
that
moment
perhaps
i
was
in
more
than
one
sense
alone
most
englishmen
know
a
good
deal
of
american
fiction
and
nothing
whatever
of
american
history
they
know
more
about
the
autocrat
of
the
than
about
the
autocrat
of
the
army
and
the
people
the
one
great
democratic
despot
of
modern
times
the
napoleon
of
the
new
world
the
only
notion
the
english
public
ever
got
about
american
politics
they
got
from
a
novel
tom
and
to
say
the
least
of
it
it
was
no
exception
to
the
prevalence
of
fiction
over
fact
hundreds
of
us
have
heard
of
tom
sawyer
for
one
who
has
heard
of
charles
sumner
and
it
is
probable
that
most
of
us
could
pass
a
more
detailed
examination
about
toddy
and
budge
than
about
lincoln
and
lee
but
in
the
case
of
andrew
jackson
it
may
be
that
i
felt
a
special
sense
of
individual
isolation
for
i
believe
that
there
are
even
fewer
among
englishmen
than
among
americans
who
realise
that
the
energy
of
that
great
man
was
largely
directed
towards
saving
us
from
the
chief
evil
which
destroys
the
nations
he
sought
to
cut
down
as
with
a
sword
of
simplicity
the
new
and
nameless
enormity
of
finance
and
he
must
have
known
as
by
a
lightning
flash
that
the
people
were
behind
him
because
all
the
politicians
were
against
him
the
end
of
that
struggle
is
not
yet
but
if
the
bank
is
stronger
than
the
sword
or
the
sceptre
of
popular
sovereignty
the
end
will
be
the
end
of
democracy
it
will
have
to
choose
between
accepting
an
acknowledged
dictator
and
accepting
dictation
which
it
dare
not
acknowledge
the
process
will
have
begun
by
giving
power
to
people
and
refusing
to
give
them
their
titles
and
it
will
have
ended
by
giving
the
power
to
people
who
refuse
to
give
us
their
names
but
i
have
a
special
reason
for
ending
this
chapter
on
the
name
of
the
great
popular
dictator
who
made
war
on
the
politicians
and
the
financiers
this
chapter
does
not
profess
to
touch
on
one
in
twenty
of
the
interesting
cities
of
america
even
in
this
particular
aspect
of
their
relation
to
the
history
of
america
which
is
so
much
neglected
in
england
if
that
were
so
there
would
be
a
great
deal
to
say
even
about
the
newest
of
them
chicago
for
instance
is
certainly
something
more
than
the
mere
yard
that
english
tradition
suggests
and
it
has
been
building
a
boulevard
not
unworthy
of
its
splendid
position
on
its
splendid
lake
but
all
these
cities
are
defiled
and
even
diseased
with
industrialism
it
is
due
to
the
americans
to
remember
that
they
have
deliberately
preserved
one
of
their
cities
from
such
defilement
and
such
disease
and
that
is
the
presidential
city
which
stands
in
the
american
mind
for
the
same
ideal
as
the
president
the
idea
of
the
republic
that
rises
above
modern
and
endures
there
has
really
been
an
effort
to
keep
the
white
house
white
no
factories
are
allowed
in
that
town
no
more
than
the
necessary
shops
are
tolerated
it
is
a
beautiful
city
and
really
retains
something
of
that
classical
serenity
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
which
the
fathers
of
the
republic
moved
with
all
respect
to
the
colonial
place
of
that
name
i
do
not
suppose
that
wellington
is
particularly
like
wellington
but
washington
really
is
like
washington
in
this
as
in
so
many
things
there
is
no
harm
in
our
criticising
foreigners
if
only
we
would
also
criticise
ourselves
in
other
words
the
world
might
need
even
less
of
its
new
charity
if
it
had
a
little
more
of
the
old
humility
when
we
complain
of
american
individualism
we
forget
that
we
have
fostered
it
by
ourselves
having
far
less
of
this
impersonal
ideal
of
the
republic
or
commonwealth
as
a
whole
when
we
complain
very
justly
for
instance
of
great
pictures
passing
into
the
possession
of
american
magnates
we
ought
to
remember
that
we
paved
the
way
for
it
by
allowing
them
all
to
accumulate
in
the
possession
of
english
magnates
it
is
bad
that
a
public
treasure
should
be
in
the
possession
of
a
private
man
in
america
but
we
took
the
first
step
in
lightly
letting
it
disappear
into
the
private
collection
of
a
man
in
england
i
know
all
about
the
genuine
national
tradition
which
treated
the
aristocracy
as
constituting
the
state
but
these
very
foreign
purchases
go
to
prove
that
we
ought
to
have
had
a
state
independent
of
the
aristocracy
it
is
true
that
rich
americans
do
sometimes
covet
the
monuments
of
our
culture
in
a
fashion
that
rightly
revolts
us
as
vulgar
and
irrational
they
are
said
sometimes
to
want
to
take
whole
buildings
away
with
them
and
too
many
of
such
buildings
are
private
and
for
sale
there
were
wilder
stories
of
a
millionaire
wishing
to
transplant
glastonbury
abbey
and
similar
buildings
as
if
they
were
portable
shrubs
in
pots
it
is
obvious
that
it
is
nonsense
as
well
as
vandalism
to
separate
glastonbury
abbey
from
glastonbury
i
can
understand
a
man
venerating
it
as
a
ruin
and
i
can
understand
a
man
despising
it
as
a
but
it
is
senseless
to
insult
a
thing
in
order
to
idolatrise
it
it
is
meaningless
to
desecrate
the
shrine
in
order
to
worship
the
stones
that
sort
of
thing
is
the
bad
side
of
american
appetite
and
ambition
and
we
are
perfectly
right
to
see
it
not
only
as
a
deliberate
blasphemy
but
as
an
unconscious
buffoonery
but
there
is
another
side
to
the
american
tradition
which
is
really
too
much
lacking
in
our
own
tradition
and
it
is
illustrated
in
this
idea
of
preserving
washington
as
a
sort
of
paradise
of
impersonal
politics
without
personal
commerce
nobody
could
buy
the
white
house
or
the
washington
monument
it
may
be
hinted
as
by
an
inhabitant
of
glastonbury
that
nobody
wants
to
but
nobody
could
if
he
did
want
to
there
is
really
a
certain
air
of
serenity
and
security
about
the
place
lacking
in
every
other
american
town
it
is
increased
of
course
by
the
clear
blue
skies
of
that
province
from
which
smoke
has
been
banished
the
effect
is
not
so
much
in
the
mere
buildings
though
they
are
classical
and
often
beautiful
but
whatever
else
they
have
built
they
have
built
a
great
blue
dome
the
largest
dome
in
the
world
and
the
place
does
express
something
in
the
inconsistent
idealism
of
this
strange
people
and
here
at
least
they
have
lifted
it
higher
than
all
the
and
set
it
in
a
stainless
sky
the
american
the
sharpest
pleasure
of
a
traveller
is
in
finding
the
things
which
he
did
not
expect
but
which
he
might
have
expected
to
expect
i
mean
the
things
that
are
at
once
so
strange
and
so
obvious
that
they
must
have
been
noticed
yet
somehow
they
have
not
been
noted
thus
i
had
heard
a
thousand
things
about
jerusalem
before
i
ever
saw
it
i
had
heard
rhapsodies
and
disparagements
of
every
description
modern
rationalistic
critics
with
characteristic
consistency
had
blamed
it
for
its
accumulated
rubbish
and
its
modern
restoration
for
its
antiquated
superstition
and
its
vulgarity
but
somehow
the
one
impression
that
had
never
pierced
through
their
description
was
the
simple
and
single
impression
of
a
city
on
a
hill
with
walls
coming
to
the
very
edge
of
slopes
that
were
almost
as
steep
as
walls
the
turreted
city
which
crowns
a
hill
in
so
many
mediaeval
landscapes
one
would
suppose
that
this
was
at
once
the
plainest
and
most
picturesque
of
all
the
facts
yet
somehow
in
my
reading
i
had
always
lost
it
amid
a
mass
of
minor
facts
that
were
merely
details
we
know
that
a
city
that
is
set
upon
a
hill
can
not
be
hid
and
yet
it
would
seem
that
it
is
exactly
the
hill
that
is
hid
though
perhaps
it
is
only
hid
from
the
wise
and
the
understanding
i
had
a
similar
and
simple
impression
when
i
discovered
america
i
can
not
avoid
the
phrase
for
it
would
really
seem
that
each
man
discovers
it
for
himself
thus
i
had
heard
a
great
deal
before
i
saw
them
about
the
tall
and
dominant
buildings
of
new
york
i
agree
that
they
have
an
instant
effect
on
the
imagination
which
i
think
is
increased
by
the
situation
in
which
they
stand
and
out
of
which
they
arose
they
are
all
the
more
impressive
because
the
building
while
it
is
vertically
so
vast
is
horizontally
almost
narrow
new
york
is
an
island
and
has
all
the
intensive
romance
of
an
island
it
is
a
thing
of
almost
infinite
height
upon
very
finite
foundations
it
is
almost
like
a
lofty
lighthouse
upon
a
lonely
rock
but
this
story
of
the
which
i
had
often
heard
would
by
itself
give
a
curiously
false
impression
of
the
freshest
and
most
curious
characteristic
of
american
architecture
told
only
in
terms
of
these
great
towers
of
stone
and
brick
in
the
big
industrial
cities
the
story
would
tend
too
much
to
an
impression
of
something
cold
and
colossal
like
the
monuments
of
asia
it
would
suggest
a
modern
babylon
altogether
too
babylonian
it
would
imply
that
a
man
of
the
new
world
was
a
sort
of
new
pharaoh
who
built
not
so
much
a
pyramid
as
a
pagoda
of
pyramids
it
would
suggest
houses
built
by
mammoths
out
of
mountains
the
cities
reared
by
elephants
in
their
own
elephantine
school
of
architecture
and
new
york
does
recall
the
most
famous
of
all
the
tower
of
babel
she
recalls
it
none
the
less
because
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
confusion
of
tongues
but
in
truth
the
very
reverse
is
true
of
most
of
the
buildings
in
america
i
had
no
sooner
passed
out
into
the
suburbs
of
new
york
on
the
way
to
boston
than
i
began
to
see
something
else
quite
contrary
and
far
more
curious
i
saw
forests
upon
forests
of
small
houses
stretching
away
to
the
horizon
as
literal
forests
do
villages
and
towns
and
cities
and
they
were
in
another
sense
literally
like
forests
they
were
all
made
of
wood
it
was
almost
as
fantastic
to
an
english
eye
as
if
they
had
been
all
made
of
cardboard
i
had
long
outlived
the
silly
old
joke
that
referred
to
americans
as
if
they
all
lived
in
the
backwoods
but
in
a
sense
if
they
do
not
live
in
the
woods
they
are
not
yet
out
of
the
wood
i
do
not
say
this
in
any
sense
as
a
criticism
as
it
happens
i
am
particularly
fond
of
wood
of
all
the
superstitions
which
our
fathers
took
lightly
enough
to
love
the
most
natural
seems
to
me
the
notion
it
is
lucky
to
touch
wood
some
of
them
affect
me
the
less
as
superstitions
because
i
feel
them
as
symbols
if
humanity
had
really
thought
friday
unlucky
it
would
have
talked
about
bad
friday
instead
of
good
friday
and
while
i
feel
the
thrill
of
thirteen
at
a
table
i
am
not
so
sure
that
it
is
the
most
miserable
of
all
human
fates
to
fill
the
places
of
the
twelve
apostles
but
the
idea
that
there
was
something
cleansing
or
wholesome
about
the
touching
of
wood
seems
to
me
one
of
those
ideas
which
are
truly
popular
because
they
are
truly
poetic
it
is
probable
enough
that
the
conception
came
originally
from
the
healing
of
the
wood
of
the
cross
but
that
only
clinches
the
divine
coincidence
it
is
like
that
other
divine
coincidence
that
the
victim
was
a
carpenter
who
might
almost
have
made
his
own
cross
whether
we
take
the
mystical
or
the
mythical
explanation
there
is
obviously
a
very
deep
connection
between
the
human
working
in
wood
and
such
plain
and
pathetic
mysticism
it
gives
something
like
a
touch
of
the
holy
childishness
to
the
tale
as
if
that
terrible
engine
could
be
a
toy
in
the
same
fashion
a
child
fancies
that
mysterious
and
sinister
horse
which
was
the
downfall
of
troy
as
something
plain
and
staring
and
perhaps
spotted
like
his
own
in
the
nursery
it
might
be
said
symbolically
that
americans
have
a
taste
for
as
they
certainly
have
a
taste
for
a
flippant
critic
might
suggest
that
they
select
so
that
even
when
they
are
sitting
down
they
need
not
be
sitting
still
something
of
this
restlessness
in
the
race
may
really
be
involved
in
the
matter
but
i
think
the
deeper
significance
of
the
may
still
be
found
in
the
deeper
symbolism
of
the
i
think
there
is
behind
all
this
fresh
and
facile
use
of
wood
a
certain
spirit
that
is
childish
in
the
good
sense
of
the
word
something
that
is
innocent
and
easily
pleased
it
is
not
altogether
untrue
still
less
is
it
unfriendly
to
say
that
the
landscape
seems
to
be
dotted
with
houses
it
is
the
true
tragedy
of
every
fallen
son
of
adam
that
he
has
grown
too
big
to
live
in
a
doll
house
these
things
seem
somehow
to
escape
the
irony
of
time
by
not
even
challenging
it
they
are
too
temporary
even
to
be
merely
temporal
these
people
are
not
building
tombs
they
are
not
as
in
the
fine
image
of
meynell
poem
merely
building
ruins
it
is
not
easy
to
imagine
the
ruins
of
a
doll
house
and
that
is
why
a
doll
house
is
an
everlasting
habitation
how
far
it
promises
a
political
permanence
is
a
matter
for
further
discussion
i
am
only
describing
the
mood
of
discovery
in
which
all
these
cottages
built
of
lath
like
the
palaces
of
a
pantomime
really
seemed
coloured
like
the
clouds
of
morning
which
are
both
fugitive
and
eternal
there
is
also
in
all
this
an
atmosphere
that
comes
in
another
sense
from
the
nursery
we
hear
much
of
americans
being
educated
on
english
literature
but
i
think
few
americans
realise
how
much
english
children
have
been
educated
on
american
literature
it
is
true
and
it
is
inevitable
that
they
can
only
be
educated
on
rather
american
literature
bernard
shaw
in
one
of
his
plays
noted
truly
the
limitations
of
the
young
american
millionaire
and
especially
the
staleness
of
his
english
culture
but
there
is
necessarily
another
side
to
it
if
the
american
talked
more
of
macaulay
than
of
nietzsche
we
should
probably
talk
more
of
emerson
than
of
ezra
pound
whether
this
staleness
is
necessarily
a
disadvantage
is
of
course
a
different
question
but
in
any
case
it
is
true
that
the
old
american
books
were
often
the
books
of
our
childhood
even
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
books
of
our
nursery
i
know
few
men
in
england
who
have
not
left
their
boyhood
to
some
extent
lost
and
entangled
in
the
forests
of
i
know
few
women
in
england
from
the
most
revolutionary
suffragette
to
the
most
carefully
preserved
early
victorian
who
will
not
confess
to
having
passed
a
happy
childhood
with
the
little
women
of
miss
alcott
was
the
first
and
by
far
the
best
book
in
the
modern
scriptures
of
and
about
all
this
american
literature
there
was
an
undefinable
savour
that
satisfied
and
even
fed
our
growing
minds
perhaps
it
was
the
smell
of
growing
things
but
i
am
far
from
certain
that
it
was
not
simply
the
smell
of
wood
now
that
all
the
memory
comes
back
to
me
it
seems
to
come
back
heavy
in
a
hundred
forms
with
the
fragrance
and
the
touch
of
timber
there
was
the
perpetual
reference
to
the
the
perpetual
background
of
the
woods
there
was
something
crude
and
clean
about
everything
something
fresh
and
strange
about
those
houses
to
which
i
could
not
then
have
put
a
name
indeed
many
things
become
clear
in
this
wilderness
of
wood
which
could
only
be
expressed
in
symbol
and
even
in
fantasy
i
will
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
shortened
the
transition
from
log
cabin
to
white
house
as
if
the
white
house
were
itself
made
of
white
wood
as
oliver
wendell
holmes
said
cuts
like
cheese
but
lasts
like
iron
for
things
like
these
but
i
will
say
that
the
experience
illuminates
some
other
lines
by
holmes
himself
little
i
ask
my
wants
are
few
i
only
ask
a
hut
of
stone
i
should
not
have
known
in
england
that
he
was
already
asking
for
a
good
deal
even
in
asking
for
that
in
the
presence
of
this
wooden
world
the
very
combination
of
words
seems
almost
a
contradiction
like
a
hut
of
marble
or
a
hovel
of
gold
it
was
therefore
with
an
almost
infantile
pleasure
that
i
looked
at
all
this
promising
expansion
of
timber
and
thought
of
the
housing
shortage
at
home
i
know
not
by
what
incongruous
movement
of
the
mind
there
swept
across
me
at
the
same
moment
the
thought
of
things
ancestral
and
hoary
with
the
light
of
ancient
dawns
the
last
war
brought
back
the
next
war
may
bring
back
bows
and
arrows
and
i
suddenly
had
a
memory
of
old
wooden
houses
in
london
and
a
model
of
shakespeare
town
it
is
possible
indeed
that
such
elizabethan
memories
may
receive
a
check
or
a
chill
when
the
traveller
comes
as
he
sometimes
does
to
the
outskirts
of
one
of
these
strange
hamlets
of
new
and
is
confronted
with
a
placard
inscribed
in
enormous
letters
us
grow
he
can
always
imagine
that
he
sees
the
timbers
swelling
before
his
eyes
like
pumpkins
in
some
summer
but
he
may
have
formed
the
conviction
that
no
such
proclamation
could
be
found
outside
shakespeare
town
and
indeed
there
is
a
serious
criticism
here
to
any
one
who
knows
history
since
the
things
that
grow
are
not
always
the
things
that
remain
and
pumpkins
of
that
expansiveness
have
a
tendency
to
burst
i
was
always
told
that
americans
were
harsh
hustling
rather
rude
and
perhaps
vulgar
but
they
were
very
practical
and
the
future
belonged
to
them
i
confess
i
felt
a
fine
shade
of
difference
i
liked
the
americans
i
thought
they
were
sympathetic
imaginative
and
full
of
fine
enthusiasms
the
one
thing
i
could
not
always
feel
clear
about
was
their
future
i
believe
they
were
happier
in
their
than
most
people
in
most
houses
having
democracy
good
education
and
a
hobby
of
work
the
one
doubt
that
did
float
across
me
was
something
like
all
this
be
here
at
all
in
two
hundred
years
that
was
the
first
impression
produced
by
the
wooden
houses
that
seemed
like
the
waggons
of
gipsies
it
is
a
serious
impression
but
there
is
an
answer
to
it
it
is
an
answer
that
opens
on
the
traveller
more
and
more
as
he
goes
westward
and
finds
the
little
towns
dotted
about
the
vast
central
prairies
and
the
answer
is
agriculture
wooden
houses
may
or
may
not
last
but
farms
will
last
and
farming
will
always
last
the
houses
may
look
like
gipsy
caravans
on
a
heath
or
common
but
they
are
not
on
a
heath
or
common
they
are
on
the
most
productive
and
prosperous
land
perhaps
in
the
modern
world
the
houses
might
fall
down
like
shanties
but
the
fields
would
remain
and
whoever
tills
those
fields
will
count
for
a
great
deal
in
the
affairs
of
humanity
they
are
already
counting
for
a
great
deal
and
possibly
for
too
much
in
the
affairs
of
america
the
real
criticism
of
the
middle
west
is
concerned
with
two
facts
neither
of
which
has
been
yet
adequately
appreciated
by
the
educated
class
in
england
the
first
is
that
the
turn
of
the
world
has
come
and
the
turn
of
the
agricultural
countries
with
it
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
resurrection
of
ireland
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
practical
surrender
of
the
bolshevist
jews
to
the
russian
peasants
the
other
is
that
in
most
places
these
peasant
societies
carry
on
what
may
be
called
the
catholic
tradition
the
middle
west
is
perhaps
the
one
considerable
place
where
they
still
carry
on
the
puritan
tradition
but
the
puritan
tradition
was
originally
a
tradition
of
the
town
and
the
second
truth
about
the
middle
west
turns
largely
on
its
moral
relation
to
the
town
as
i
shall
suggest
presently
there
is
much
in
common
between
this
agricultural
society
of
america
and
the
great
agricultural
societies
of
europe
it
tends
as
the
agricultural
society
nearly
always
does
to
some
decent
degree
of
democracy
the
agricultural
society
tends
to
the
agrarian
law
but
in
puritan
america
there
is
an
additional
problem
which
i
can
hardly
explain
without
a
periphrasis
there
was
a
time
when
the
progress
of
the
cities
seemed
to
mock
the
decay
of
the
country
it
is
more
and
more
true
i
think
that
it
is
rather
the
decay
of
the
cities
that
seems
to
poison
the
progress
and
promise
of
the
countryside
the
cinema
boasts
of
being
a
substitute
for
the
tavern
but
i
think
it
a
very
bad
substitute
i
think
so
quite
apart
from
the
question
about
fermented
liquor
nobody
enjoys
cinemas
more
than
i
but
to
enjoy
them
a
man
has
only
to
look
and
not
even
to
listen
and
in
a
tavern
he
has
to
talk
occasionally
i
admit
he
has
to
fight
but
he
need
never
move
at
the
movies
thus
in
the
real
village
inn
are
the
real
village
politics
while
in
the
other
are
only
the
remote
and
unreal
metropolitan
politics
and
those
central
city
politics
are
not
only
cosmopolitan
politics
but
corrupt
politics
they
corrupt
everything
that
they
reach
and
this
is
the
real
point
about
many
perplexing
questions
for
instance
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
is
the
whole
point
about
feminism
and
the
factory
it
is
very
largely
the
point
about
feminism
and
many
other
callings
apparently
more
cultured
than
the
factory
such
as
the
law
court
and
the
political
platform
when
i
see
women
so
wildly
anxious
to
tie
themselves
to
all
this
machinery
of
the
modern
city
my
first
feeling
is
not
indignation
but
that
dark
and
ominous
sort
of
pity
with
which
we
should
see
a
crowd
rushing
to
embark
in
a
leaking
ship
under
a
lowering
storm
when
i
see
wives
and
mothers
going
in
for
business
government
i
not
only
regard
it
as
a
bad
business
but
as
a
bankrupt
business
it
seems
to
me
very
much
as
if
the
peasant
women
just
before
the
french
revolution
had
insisted
on
being
made
duchesses
or
as
is
quite
as
logical
and
likely
on
being
made
dukes
it
is
as
if
those
ragged
women
instead
of
crying
out
for
bread
had
cried
out
for
powder
and
patches
by
the
time
they
were
wearing
them
they
would
be
the
only
people
wearing
them
for
powder
and
patches
soon
went
out
of
fashion
but
bread
does
not
go
out
of
fashion
in
the
same
way
if
women
desert
the
family
for
the
factory
they
may
find
they
have
only
done
it
for
a
deserted
factory
it
would
have
been
very
unwise
of
the
lower
orders
to
claim
all
the
privileges
of
the
higher
orders
in
the
last
days
of
the
french
monarchy
it
would
have
been
very
laborious
to
learn
the
science
of
heraldry
or
the
tables
of
precedence
when
all
such
things
were
at
once
most
complicated
and
most
moribund
it
would
be
tiresome
to
be
taught
all
those
tricks
just
when
the
whole
bag
of
tricks
was
coming
to
an
end
a
french
satirist
might
have
written
a
fine
apologue
about
jacques
bonhomme
coming
up
to
paris
in
his
wooden
shoes
and
demanding
to
be
made
gold
stick
in
waiting
in
the
name
of
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
but
i
fear
the
stick
in
waiting
would
be
waiting
still
one
of
the
first
topics
on
which
i
heard
conversation
turning
in
america
was
that
of
a
very
interesting
book
called
which
involves
many
of
these
questions
of
the
modern
industrial
and
the
eternal
feminine
it
is
simply
the
story
or
perhaps
rather
the
study
than
the
story
of
a
young
married
woman
in
one
of
the
multitudinous
little
towns
on
the
great
central
plains
of
america
and
of
a
sort
of
struggle
between
her
own
more
restless
culture
and
the
provincial
prosperity
of
her
neighbours
there
are
a
number
of
true
and
telling
suggestions
in
the
book
but
the
one
touch
which
i
found
tingling
in
the
memory
of
many
readers
was
the
last
sentence
in
which
the
master
of
the
house
with
unshaken
simplicity
merely
asks
for
the
whereabouts
of
some
domestic
implement
i
think
it
was
a
it
seems
to
me
a
harmless
request
but
from
the
way
people
talked
about
it
one
might
suppose
he
had
asked
for
a
to
screw
down
the
wife
in
her
coffin
and
a
great
many
advanced
persons
would
tell
us
that
wooden
house
in
which
she
lived
really
was
like
a
wooden
coffin
but
this
appears
to
me
to
be
taking
a
somewhat
funereal
view
of
the
life
of
humanity
for
after
all
on
the
face
of
it
at
any
rate
this
is
merely
the
life
of
humanity
and
even
the
life
which
all
humanitarians
have
striven
to
give
to
humanity
revolutionists
have
treated
it
not
only
as
the
normal
but
even
as
the
ideal
revolutionary
wars
have
been
waged
to
establish
this
revolutionary
heroes
have
fought
and
revolutionary
martyrs
have
died
only
to
build
such
a
wooden
house
for
such
a
worthy
family
men
have
taken
the
sword
and
perished
by
the
sword
in
order
that
the
poor
gentleman
might
have
liberty
to
look
for
his
for
there
is
here
a
fact
about
america
that
is
almost
entirely
unknown
in
england
the
english
have
not
in
the
least
realised
the
real
strength
of
america
we
in
england
hear
a
great
deal
we
hear
far
too
much
about
the
economic
energy
of
industrial
america
about
the
money
of
morgan
or
the
machinery
of
edison
we
never
realise
that
while
we
in
england
suffer
from
the
same
sort
of
successes
in
capitalism
and
clockwork
we
have
not
got
what
the
americans
have
got
something
at
least
to
balance
it
in
the
way
of
a
free
agriculture
a
vast
field
of
free
farms
dotted
with
small
freeholders
for
the
reason
i
shall
mention
in
a
moment
they
are
not
perhaps
in
the
fullest
and
finest
sense
a
peasantry
but
they
are
in
the
practical
and
political
sense
a
pure
peasantry
in
that
their
comparative
equality
is
a
true
counterweight
to
the
toppling
injustice
of
the
towns
and
even
in
places
like
that
described
as
main
street
that
comparative
equality
can
immediately
be
felt
the
men
may
be
provincials
but
they
are
certainly
citizens
they
consult
on
a
common
basis
and
i
repeat
that
in
this
after
all
they
do
achieve
what
many
prophets
and
righteous
men
have
died
to
achieve
this
plain
village
fairly
prosperous
fairly
equal
untaxed
by
tyrants
and
untroubled
by
wars
is
after
all
the
place
which
reformers
have
regarded
as
their
aim
whenever
reformers
have
used
their
wits
sufficiently
to
have
any
aim
the
march
to
utopia
the
march
to
the
earthly
paradise
the
march
to
the
new
jerusalem
has
been
very
largely
the
march
to
main
street
and
the
latest
modern
sensation
is
a
book
written
to
show
how
wretched
it
is
to
live
there
all
this
is
true
and
i
think
the
lady
might
be
more
contented
in
her
coffin
which
is
more
comfortably
furnished
than
most
of
the
coffins
where
her
fellow
creatures
live
nevertheless
there
is
an
answer
to
this
or
at
least
a
modification
of
it
there
is
a
case
for
the
lady
and
a
case
against
the
gentleman
and
the
and
when
we
have
noted
what
it
really
is
we
have
noted
the
real
disadvantage
in
a
situation
like
that
of
modern
america
and
especially
the
middle
west
and
with
that
we
come
back
to
the
truth
with
which
i
started
this
speculation
the
truth
that
few
have
yet
realised
but
of
which
i
for
one
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
industrialism
is
spreading
because
it
is
decaying
that
only
the
dust
and
ashes
of
its
dissolution
are
choking
up
the
growth
of
natural
things
everywhere
and
turning
the
green
world
grey
in
this
relative
agricultural
equality
the
americans
of
the
middle
west
are
far
in
advance
of
the
english
of
the
twentieth
century
it
is
not
their
fault
if
they
are
still
some
centuries
behind
the
english
of
the
twelfth
century
but
the
defect
by
which
they
fall
short
of
being
a
true
peasantry
is
that
they
do
not
produce
their
own
spiritual
food
in
the
same
sense
as
their
own
material
food
they
do
not
like
some
peasantries
create
other
kinds
of
culture
besides
the
kind
called
agriculture
their
culture
comes
from
the
great
cities
and
that
is
where
all
the
evil
comes
from
if
a
man
had
gone
across
england
in
the
middle
ages
or
even
across
europe
in
more
recent
times
he
would
have
found
a
culture
which
showed
its
vitality
by
its
variety
we
know
the
adventures
of
the
three
brothers
in
the
old
fairy
tales
who
passed
across
the
endless
plain
from
city
to
city
and
found
one
kingdom
ruled
by
a
wizard
and
another
wasted
by
a
dragon
one
people
living
in
castles
of
crystal
and
another
sitting
by
fountains
of
wine
these
are
but
legendary
enlargements
of
the
real
adventures
of
a
traveller
passing
from
one
patch
of
peasantry
to
another
and
finding
women
wearing
strange
and
men
singing
new
songs
a
traveller
in
america
would
be
somewhat
surprised
if
he
found
the
people
in
the
city
of
louis
all
wearing
crowns
and
crusading
armour
in
honour
of
their
patron
saint
he
might
even
feel
some
faint
surprise
if
he
found
all
the
citizens
of
philadelphia
clad
in
a
composite
costume
combining
that
of
a
quaker
with
that
of
a
red
indian
in
honour
of
the
noble
treaty
of
william
penn
yet
these
are
the
sort
of
local
and
traditional
things
that
would
really
be
found
giving
variety
to
the
valleys
of
mediaeval
europe
i
myself
felt
a
perfectly
genuine
and
generous
exhilaration
of
freedom
and
fresh
enterprise
in
new
places
like
oklahoma
but
you
would
hardly
find
in
oklahoma
what
was
found
in
oberammergau
what
goes
to
oklahoma
is
not
the
peasant
play
but
the
cinema
and
the
objection
to
the
cinema
is
not
so
much
that
it
goes
to
oklahoma
as
that
it
does
not
come
from
oklahoma
in
other
words
these
people
have
on
the
economic
side
a
much
closer
approach
than
we
have
to
economic
freedom
it
is
not
for
us
who
have
allowed
our
land
to
be
stolen
by
squires
and
then
vulgarised
by
sham
squires
to
sneer
at
such
colonists
as
merely
crude
and
prosaic
they
at
least
have
really
kept
something
of
the
simplicity
and
therefore
the
dignity
of
democracy
and
that
democracy
may
yet
save
their
country
even
from
the
calamities
of
wealth
and
science
but
while
these
farmers
do
not
need
to
become
industrial
in
order
to
become
industrious
they
do
tend
to
become
industrial
in
so
far
as
they
become
intellectual
their
culture
and
to
some
great
extent
their
creed
do
come
along
the
railroads
from
the
great
modern
urban
centres
and
bring
with
them
a
blast
of
death
and
a
reek
of
rotting
things
it
is
that
influence
that
alone
prevents
the
middle
west
from
progressing
towards
the
middle
ages
for
after
all
linked
up
in
a
hundred
legends
of
the
middle
ages
may
be
found
a
symbolic
pattern
of
hammers
and
nails
and
saws
and
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
have
also
sanctified
there
is
no
reason
why
the
that
seemed
such
a
trifle
to
the
author
should
not
have
been
borne
in
triumph
down
main
street
like
a
sword
of
state
in
some
pageant
of
the
guild
of
joseph
of
the
carpenters
or
dunstan
of
the
smiths
it
was
the
catholic
poetry
and
piety
that
filled
common
life
with
something
that
is
lacking
in
the
worthy
and
virile
democracy
of
the
west
nor
are
americans
of
intelligence
so
ignorant
of
this
as
some
may
suppose
there
is
an
admirable
society
called
the
mediaevalists
in
chicago
whose
name
and
address
will
strike
many
as
suggesting
a
certain
struggle
of
the
soul
against
the
environment
with
the
national
heartiness
they
blazon
their
with
heraldry
and
the
hues
of
gothic
windows
with
the
national
high
spirits
they
assume
the
fancy
dress
of
friars
but
any
one
who
should
essay
to
laugh
at
them
instead
of
with
them
would
find
out
his
mistake
for
many
of
them
do
really
know
a
great
deal
about
mediaevalism
much
more
than
i
do
or
most
other
men
brought
up
on
an
island
that
is
crowded
with
its
cathedrals
something
of
the
same
spirit
may
be
seen
in
the
beautiful
new
plans
and
buildings
of
yale
deliberately
modelled
not
on
classical
harmony
but
on
gothic
irregularity
and
surprise
the
grace
and
energy
of
the
mediaeval
architecture
resurrected
by
a
man
like
cram
of
boston
has
behind
it
not
merely
artistic
but
historical
and
ethical
enthusiasm
an
enthusiasm
for
the
catholic
creed
which
made
mediaeval
civilisation
even
on
the
huge
puritan
plains
of
the
middle
west
the
influence
strays
in
the
strangest
fashion
and
it
is
notable
that
among
the
pessimistic
epitaphs
of
the
spoon
river
anthology
in
that
churchyard
compared
with
which
most
churchyards
are
cheery
among
the
suicides
and
secret
drinkers
and
monomaniacs
and
hideous
hypocrites
of
that
happy
village
almost
the
only
record
of
respect
and
a
recognition
of
wider
hopes
is
dedicated
to
the
catholic
priest
but
main
street
is
main
street
in
the
main
main
street
is
modern
street
in
its
multiplicity
of
mildly
people
and
all
these
historic
things
are
a
thousand
miles
from
them
they
have
not
heard
the
ancient
noise
either
of
arts
or
arms
the
building
of
the
cathedral
or
the
marching
of
the
crusade
but
at
least
they
have
not
deliberately
slandered
the
crusade
and
defaced
the
cathedral
and
if
they
have
not
produced
the
peasant
arts
they
can
still
produce
the
peasant
crafts
they
can
sow
and
plough
and
reap
and
live
by
these
everlasting
things
nor
shall
the
foundations
of
their
state
be
moved
and
the
memory
of
those
colossal
fields
of
those
fruitful
deserts
came
back
the
more
readily
into
my
mind
because
i
finished
these
reflections
in
the
very
heart
of
a
modern
industrial
city
if
it
can
be
said
to
have
a
heart
it
was
in
fact
an
english
industrial
city
but
it
struck
me
that
it
might
very
well
be
an
american
one
and
it
also
struck
me
that
we
yield
rather
too
easily
to
america
the
dusty
palm
of
industrial
enterprise
and
feel
far
too
little
apprehension
about
greener
and
fresher
vegetables
there
is
a
story
of
an
american
who
carefully
studied
all
the
sights
of
london
or
rome
or
paris
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
had
nothing
on
minneapolis
it
seems
to
me
that
minneapolis
has
nothing
on
manchester
there
were
the
same
grey
vistas
of
shops
full
of
rubber
tyres
and
metallic
appliances
a
man
felt
that
he
might
walk
a
day
without
seeing
a
blade
of
grass
the
whole
horizon
was
so
infinite
with
efficiency
the
factory
chimneys
might
have
been
pittsburg
the
might
have
been
new
york
one
looked
up
in
a
sort
of
despair
at
the
sky
not
for
a
but
in
a
sense
for
a
sign
for
some
sentence
of
significance
and
judgment
by
the
instinct
that
makes
any
man
in
such
a
scene
seek
for
the
only
thing
that
has
not
been
made
by
men
but
even
that
was
illogical
for
it
was
night
and
i
could
only
expect
to
see
the
stars
which
might
have
reminded
me
of
old
glory
but
that
was
not
the
sign
that
oppressed
me
all
the
ground
was
a
wilderness
of
stone
and
all
the
buildings
a
forest
of
brick
i
was
far
in
the
interior
of
a
labyrinth
of
lifeless
things
only
looking
up
between
two
black
chimneys
and
a
telegraph
pole
i
saw
vast
and
far
and
faint
as
the
first
men
saw
it
the
silver
pattern
of
the
plough
american
business
it
is
a
commonplace
that
men
are
all
agreed
in
using
symbols
and
all
differ
about
the
meaning
of
the
symbols
it
is
obvious
that
a
russian
republican
might
come
to
identify
the
eagle
as
a
bird
of
empire
and
therefore
a
bird
of
prey
but
when
he
ultimately
escaped
to
the
land
of
the
free
he
might
find
the
same
bird
on
the
american
coinage
figuring
as
a
bird
of
freedom
doubtless
he
might
find
many
other
things
to
surprise
him
in
the
land
of
the
free
and
many
calculated
to
make
him
think
that
the
bird
if
not
imperial
was
at
least
rather
imperious
but
i
am
not
discussing
those
exceptional
details
here
it
is
equally
obvious
that
a
russian
reactionary
might
cross
the
world
with
a
vow
of
vengeance
against
the
red
flag
but
that
authoritarian
might
have
some
difficulties
with
the
authorities
if
he
shot
a
man
for
using
the
red
flag
on
the
railway
between
willesden
and
clapham
junction
but
of
course
the
difficulty
about
symbols
is
generally
much
more
subtle
than
in
these
simple
cases
i
have
remarked
elsewhere
that
the
first
thing
which
a
traveller
should
write
about
is
the
thing
which
he
has
not
read
about
it
may
be
a
small
or
secondary
thing
but
it
is
a
thing
that
he
has
seen
and
not
merely
expected
to
see
i
gave
the
example
of
the
great
multitude
of
wooden
houses
in
america
we
might
say
of
wooden
towns
and
wooden
cities
but
after
he
has
seen
such
things
his
next
duty
is
to
see
the
meaning
of
them
and
here
a
great
deal
of
complication
and
controversy
is
possible
the
thing
probably
does
not
mean
what
he
first
supposes
it
to
mean
on
the
face
of
it
but
even
on
the
face
of
it
it
might
mean
many
different
and
even
opposite
things
for
instance
a
wooden
house
might
suggest
an
almost
savage
solitude
a
rude
shanty
put
together
by
a
pioneer
in
a
forest
or
it
might
mean
a
very
recent
and
rapid
solution
of
the
housing
problem
conducted
cheaply
and
therefore
on
a
very
large
scale
a
wooden
house
might
suggest
the
very
newest
thing
in
america
or
one
of
the
very
oldest
things
in
england
it
might
mean
a
grey
ruin
at
stratford
or
a
white
exhibition
at
earl
court
it
is
when
we
come
to
this
interpretation
of
international
symbols
that
we
make
most
of
the
international
mistakes
without
the
smallest
error
of
detail
i
will
promise
to
prove
that
oriental
women
are
independent
because
they
wear
trousers
or
oriental
men
subject
because
they
wear
skirts
merely
to
apply
it
to
this
case
i
will
take
the
example
of
two
very
commonplace
and
trivial
objects
of
modern
life
a
walking
stick
and
a
fur
coat
as
it
happened
i
travelled
about
america
with
two
sticks
like
a
japanese
nobleman
with
his
two
swords
i
fear
the
simile
is
too
stately
i
bore
more
resemblance
to
a
cripple
with
two
crutches
or
a
highly
ineffectual
version
of
the
devil
on
two
sticks
i
carried
them
both
because
i
valued
them
both
and
did
not
wish
to
risk
losing
either
of
them
in
my
erratic
travels
one
is
a
very
plain
grey
stick
from
the
woods
of
buckinghamshire
but
as
i
took
it
with
me
to
palestine
it
partakes
of
the
character
of
a
pilgrim
staff
when
i
can
say
that
i
have
taken
the
same
stick
to
jerusalem
and
to
chicago
i
think
the
stick
and
i
may
both
have
a
rest
the
other
which
i
value
even
more
was
given
me
by
the
knights
of
columbus
at
yale
and
i
wish
i
could
think
that
their
chivalric
title
allowed
me
to
regard
it
as
a
sword
now
i
do
not
know
whether
the
americans
i
met
struck
by
the
fastidious
foppery
of
my
dress
and
appearance
concluded
that
it
is
the
custom
of
elegant
english
dandies
to
carry
two
walking
sticks
but
i
do
know
that
it
is
much
less
common
among
americans
than
among
englishmen
to
carry
even
one
the
point
however
is
not
merely
that
more
sticks
are
carried
by
englishmen
than
by
americans
it
is
that
the
sticks
which
are
carried
by
americans
stand
for
something
entirely
different
in
america
a
stick
is
commonly
called
a
cane
and
it
has
about
it
something
of
the
atmosphere
which
the
poet
described
as
the
nice
conduct
of
the
clouded
cane
it
would
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
when
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
see
a
man
carrying
a
light
stick
they
deduce
that
if
he
does
that
he
does
nothing
else
but
there
is
about
it
a
faint
flavour
of
luxury
and
lounging
and
most
of
the
energetic
citizens
of
this
energetic
society
avoid
it
by
instinct
now
in
an
englishman
like
myself
carrying
a
stick
may
imply
lounging
but
it
does
not
imply
luxury
and
i
can
say
with
some
firmness
that
it
does
not
imply
dandyism
in
a
great
many
englishmen
it
means
the
very
opposite
even
of
lounging
by
one
of
those
fantastic
paradoxes
which
are
the
mystery
of
nationality
a
walking
stick
often
actually
means
walking
it
frequently
suggests
the
very
reverse
of
the
beau
with
his
clouded
cane
it
does
not
suggest
a
town
type
but
rather
specially
a
country
type
it
rather
implies
the
kind
of
englishman
who
tramps
about
in
lanes
and
meadows
and
knocks
the
tops
off
thistles
it
suggests
the
sort
of
man
who
has
carried
the
stick
through
his
native
woods
and
perhaps
even
cut
it
in
his
native
woods
there
are
plenty
of
these
vigorous
loungers
no
doubt
in
the
rural
parts
of
america
but
the
idea
of
a
walking
stick
would
not
especially
suggest
them
to
americans
it
would
not
call
up
such
figures
like
a
fairy
wand
it
would
be
easy
to
trace
back
the
difference
to
many
english
origins
possibly
to
aristocratic
origins
to
the
idea
of
the
old
squire
a
man
vigorous
and
even
rustic
but
trained
to
hold
a
useless
staff
rather
than
a
useful
tool
it
might
be
suggested
that
american
citizens
do
at
least
so
far
love
freedom
as
to
like
to
have
their
hands
free
it
might
be
suggested
on
the
other
hand
that
they
keep
their
hands
for
the
handles
of
many
machines
and
that
the
hand
on
a
handle
is
less
free
than
the
hand
on
a
stick
or
even
a
tool
but
these
again
are
controversial
questions
and
i
am
only
noting
a
fact
if
an
englishman
wished
to
imagine
more
or
less
exactly
what
the
impression
is
and
how
misleading
it
is
he
could
find
something
like
a
parallel
in
what
he
himself
feels
about
a
fur
coat
when
i
first
found
myself
among
the
crowds
on
the
main
floor
of
a
new
york
hotel
my
rather
exaggerated
impression
of
the
luxury
of
the
place
was
largely
produced
by
the
number
of
men
in
fur
coats
and
what
we
should
consider
rather
ostentatious
fur
coats
with
all
the
fur
outside
now
an
englishman
has
a
number
of
atmospheric
but
largely
accidental
associations
in
connection
with
a
fur
coat
i
will
not
say
that
he
thinks
a
man
in
a
fur
coat
must
be
a
wealthy
and
wicked
man
but
i
do
say
that
in
his
own
ideal
and
perfect
vision
a
wealthy
and
wicked
man
would
wear
a
fur
coat
thus
i
had
the
sensation
of
standing
in
a
surging
mob
of
american
millionaires
or
even
african
millionaires
for
the
millionaires
of
chicago
must
be
like
the
knights
of
the
round
table
compared
with
the
millionaires
of
johannesburg
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
man
in
the
fur
coat
was
not
even
an
american
millionaire
but
simply
an
american
it
did
not
signify
luxury
but
rather
necessity
and
even
a
harsh
and
almost
heroic
necessity
orson
probably
wore
a
fur
coat
and
he
was
brought
up
by
bears
but
not
the
bears
of
wall
street
eskimos
are
generally
represented
as
a
furry
folk
but
they
are
not
necessarily
engaged
in
delicate
financial
operations
even
in
the
typical
and
appropriate
occupation
called
freezing
out
and
if
the
american
is
not
exactly
an
arctic
traveller
rushing
from
pole
to
pole
at
least
he
is
often
literally
fleeing
from
ice
to
ice
he
has
to
make
a
very
extreme
distinction
between
outdoor
and
indoor
clothing
he
has
to
live
in
an
icehouse
outside
and
a
hothouse
inside
so
hot
that
he
may
be
said
to
construct
an
icehouse
inside
that
he
turns
himself
into
an
icehouse
and
warms
himself
against
the
cold
until
he
is
warm
enough
to
eat
ices
but
the
point
is
that
the
same
coat
of
fur
which
in
england
would
indicate
the
sybarite
life
may
here
very
well
indicate
the
strenuous
life
just
as
the
same
walking
stick
which
would
here
suggest
a
lounger
would
in
england
suggest
a
plodder
and
almost
a
pilgrim
and
these
two
trifles
are
types
which
i
should
like
to
put
by
way
of
proviso
and
apology
at
the
very
beginning
of
any
attempt
at
a
record
of
any
impressions
of
a
foreign
society
they
serve
merely
to
illustrate
the
most
important
impression
of
all
the
impression
of
how
false
all
impressions
may
be
i
suspect
that
most
of
the
very
false
impressions
have
come
from
the
careful
record
of
very
true
facts
they
have
come
from
the
fatal
power
of
observing
the
facts
without
being
able
to
observe
the
truth
they
came
from
seeing
the
symbol
with
the
most
vivid
clarity
and
being
blind
to
all
that
it
symbolises
it
is
as
if
a
man
who
knew
no
greek
should
imagine
that
he
could
read
a
greek
inscription
because
he
took
the
greek
r
for
an
english
p
or
the
greek
long
e
for
an
english
i
do
not
mention
this
merely
as
a
criticism
on
other
impressions
of
america
but
as
a
criticism
on
my
own
i
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
i
am
well
aware
that
all
my
views
are
subject
to
this
sort
of
potential
criticism
and
that
even
when
i
am
certain
of
the
facts
i
do
not
profess
to
be
certain
of
the
deductions
in
this
chapter
i
hope
to
point
out
how
a
misunderstanding
of
this
kind
affects
the
common
impression
not
altogether
unfounded
that
the
americans
talk
about
dollars
but
for
the
moment
i
am
merely
anxious
to
avoid
a
similar
misunderstanding
when
i
talk
about
americans
about
the
dogmas
of
democracy
about
the
right
of
a
people
to
its
own
symbols
whether
they
be
coins
or
customs
i
am
convinced
and
no
longer
to
be
shaken
but
about
the
meaning
of
those
symbols
in
silver
or
other
substances
i
am
always
open
to
correction
that
error
is
the
price
we
pay
for
the
great
glory
of
nationality
and
in
this
sense
i
am
quite
ready
at
the
start
to
warn
my
own
readers
against
my
own
opinions
the
fact
without
the
truth
is
futile
indeed
the
fact
without
the
truth
is
false
i
have
already
noted
that
this
is
especially
true
touching
our
observations
of
a
strange
country
and
it
is
certainly
true
touching
one
small
fact
which
has
swelled
into
a
large
fable
i
mean
the
fable
about
america
commonly
summed
up
in
the
phrase
about
the
almighty
dollar
i
do
not
think
the
dollar
is
almighty
in
america
i
fancy
many
things
are
mightier
including
many
ideals
and
some
rather
insane
ideals
but
i
think
it
might
be
maintained
that
the
dollar
has
another
of
the
attributes
of
deity
if
it
is
not
omnipotent
it
is
in
a
sense
omnipresent
whatever
americans
think
about
dollars
it
is
i
think
relatively
true
that
they
talk
about
dollars
if
a
mere
mechanical
record
could
be
taken
by
the
modern
machinery
of
dictaphones
and
stenography
i
do
not
think
it
probable
that
the
mere
word
would
occur
more
often
in
any
given
number
of
american
conversations
than
the
mere
word
or
in
a
similar
number
of
english
conversations
and
these
statistics
like
nearly
all
statistics
would
be
utterly
useless
and
even
fundamentally
false
it
is
as
if
we
should
calculate
that
the
word
had
been
mentioned
a
certain
number
of
times
in
a
particular
london
street
or
so
many
times
more
often
than
the
word
had
been
used
in
stoke
poges
doubtless
there
are
statisticians
capable
of
carefully
collecting
those
statistics
also
and
doubtless
there
are
scientific
social
reformers
capable
of
legislating
on
the
basis
of
them
they
would
probably
argue
from
the
elephantine
imagery
of
the
london
street
that
such
and
such
a
percentage
of
the
householders
were
megalomaniacs
and
required
medical
care
and
police
coercion
and
doubtless
their
calculations
like
nearly
all
such
calculations
would
leave
out
the
only
important
point
as
that
the
street
was
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
zoo
or
was
yet
more
happily
situated
under
the
benignant
shadow
of
the
elephant
and
castle
and
in
the
same
way
the
mechanical
calculation
about
the
mention
of
dollars
is
entirely
useless
unless
we
have
some
moral
understanding
of
why
they
are
mentioned
it
certainly
does
not
mean
merely
a
love
of
money
and
if
it
did
a
love
of
money
may
mean
a
great
many
very
different
and
even
contrary
things
the
love
of
money
is
very
different
in
a
peasant
or
in
a
pirate
in
a
miser
or
in
a
gambler
in
a
great
financier
or
in
a
man
doing
some
practical
and
productive
work
now
this
difference
in
the
conversation
of
american
and
english
business
men
arises
i
think
from
certain
much
deeper
things
in
the
american
which
are
generally
not
understood
by
the
englishman
it
also
arises
from
much
deeper
things
in
the
englishman
of
which
the
englishman
is
even
more
ignorant
to
begin
with
i
fancy
that
the
american
quite
apart
from
any
love
of
money
has
a
great
love
of
measurement
he
will
mention
the
exact
size
or
weight
of
things
in
a
way
which
appears
to
us
as
irrelevant
it
is
as
if
we
were
to
say
that
a
man
came
to
see
us
carrying
three
feet
of
walking
stick
and
four
inches
of
cigar
it
is
so
in
cases
that
have
no
possible
connection
with
any
avarice
or
greed
for
gain
an
american
will
praise
the
prodigal
generosity
of
some
other
man
in
giving
up
his
own
estate
for
the
good
of
the
poor
but
he
will
generally
say
that
the
philanthropist
gave
them
a
park
where
an
englishman
would
think
it
quite
sufficient
to
say
that
he
gave
them
a
park
there
is
something
about
this
precision
which
seems
suitable
to
the
american
atmosphere
to
the
hard
sunlight
and
the
cloudless
skies
and
the
glittering
detail
of
the
architecture
and
the
landscape
just
as
the
vaguer
english
version
is
consonant
to
our
mistier
and
more
impressionist
scenery
it
is
also
connected
perhaps
with
something
more
boyish
about
the
younger
civilisation
and
corresponds
to
the
passionate
particularity
with
which
a
boy
will
distinguish
the
uniforms
of
regiments
the
rigs
of
ships
or
even
the
colours
of
tram
tickets
it
is
a
certain
godlike
appetite
for
things
as
distinct
from
thoughts
but
there
is
also
of
course
a
much
deeper
cause
of
the
difference
and
it
can
easily
be
deduced
by
noting
the
real
nature
of
the
difference
itself
when
two
business
men
in
a
train
are
talking
about
dollars
i
am
not
so
foolish
as
to
expect
them
to
be
talking
about
the
philosophy
of
thomas
aquinas
but
if
they
were
two
english
business
men
i
should
not
expect
them
to
be
talking
about
business
probably
it
would
be
about
some
sport
and
most
probably
some
sport
in
which
they
themselves
never
dreamed
of
indulging
the
approximate
difference
is
that
the
american
talks
about
his
work
and
the
englishman
about
his
holidays
his
ideal
is
not
labour
but
leisure
like
every
other
national
characteristic
this
is
not
primarily
a
point
for
praise
or
blame
in
essence
it
involves
neither
and
in
effect
it
involves
both
it
is
certainly
connected
with
that
snobbishness
which
is
the
great
sin
of
english
society
the
englishman
does
love
to
conceive
himself
as
a
sort
of
country
gentleman
and
his
castles
in
the
air
are
all
castles
in
scotland
rather
than
in
spain
for
as
an
ideal
a
scotch
castle
is
as
english
as
a
welsh
rarebit
or
an
irish
stew
and
if
he
talks
less
about
money
i
fear
it
is
sometimes
because
in
one
sense
he
thinks
more
of
it
money
is
a
mystery
in
the
old
and
literal
sense
of
something
too
sacred
for
speech
gold
is
a
god
and
like
the
god
of
some
agnostics
has
no
name
and
is
worshipped
only
in
his
works
it
is
true
in
a
sense
that
the
english
gentleman
wishes
to
have
enough
money
to
be
able
to
forget
it
but
it
may
be
questioned
whether
he
does
entirely
forget
it
as
against
this
weakness
the
american
has
succeeded
at
the
price
of
a
great
deal
of
crudity
and
clatter
in
making
general
a
very
real
respect
for
work
he
has
partly
disenchanted
the
dangerous
glamour
of
the
gentleman
and
in
that
sense
has
achieved
some
degree
of
democracy
which
is
the
most
difficult
achievement
in
the
world
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
good
side
to
the
englishman
of
leisure
and
one
which
the
american
spirit
tends
to
miss
it
may
be
expressed
in
the
word
or
still
better
in
the
word
the
englishman
in
his
character
of
robin
hood
really
has
got
two
strings
to
his
bow
indeed
the
englishman
really
is
well
represented
by
robin
hood
for
there
is
always
something
about
him
that
may
literally
be
called
outlawed
in
the
sense
of
being
or
outside
the
rules
a
frenchman
said
of
browning
that
his
centre
was
not
in
the
middle
and
it
may
be
said
of
many
an
englishman
that
his
heart
is
not
where
his
treasure
is
browning
expressed
a
very
english
sentiment
when
he
said
i
like
to
know
a
butcher
paints
a
baker
rhymes
for
his
pursuit
much
acquaints
his
soul
with
song
or
haply
mute
blows
out
his
brains
upon
the
flute
stevenson
touched
on
the
same
insular
sentiment
when
he
said
that
many
men
he
knew
who
were
to
the
outward
eye
might
in
the
life
of
contemplation
sit
with
the
saints
now
the
extraordinary
achievement
of
the
american
is
that
his
poetic
enthusiasm
can
really
be
for
meat
sales
not
for
money
but
for
meat
an
american
commercial
traveller
asked
me
with
a
religious
fire
in
his
eyes
whether
i
did
not
think
that
salesmanship
could
be
an
art
in
england
there
are
many
salesmen
who
are
sincerely
fond
of
art
but
seldom
of
the
art
of
salesmanship
art
is
with
them
a
hobby
a
thing
of
leisure
and
liberty
that
is
why
the
english
traveller
talks
if
not
of
art
then
of
sport
that
is
why
the
two
city
men
in
the
london
train
if
they
are
not
talking
about
golf
may
be
talking
about
gardening
if
they
are
not
talking
about
dollars
or
the
equivalent
of
dollars
the
reason
lies
much
deeper
than
any
superficial
praise
or
blame
touching
the
desire
for
wealth
in
the
english
case
at
least
it
lies
very
deep
in
the
english
spirit
many
of
the
greatest
english
things
have
had
this
lighter
and
looser
character
of
a
hobby
or
a
holiday
experiment
even
a
masterpiece
has
often
been
a
the
works
of
shakespeare
come
out
so
casually
that
they
can
be
attributed
to
the
most
improbable
people
even
to
bacon
the
sonnets
of
shakespeare
are
picked
up
afterwards
as
if
out
of
a
wastepaper
basket
the
immortality
of
johnson
does
not
rest
on
the
written
leaves
he
collected
but
entirely
on
the
words
he
wasted
the
words
he
scattered
to
the
winds
so
great
a
thing
as
pickwick
is
almost
a
kind
of
accident
it
began
as
something
secondary
and
grew
into
something
primary
and
it
began
with
mere
words
written
to
illustrate
somebody
else
pictures
and
swelled
like
an
epic
expanded
from
an
epigram
it
might
almost
be
said
that
in
the
case
of
pickwick
the
author
began
as
the
servant
of
the
artist
but
as
in
the
same
story
of
pickwick
the
servant
became
greater
than
the
master
this
incalculable
and
accidental
quality
like
all
national
qualities
has
its
strength
and
weakness
but
it
does
represent
a
certain
reserve
fund
of
interests
in
the
englishman
life
and
distinguishes
him
from
the
other
extreme
type
of
the
millionaire
who
works
till
he
drops
or
who
drops
because
he
stops
working
it
is
the
great
achievement
of
american
civilisation
that
in
that
country
it
really
is
not
cant
to
talk
about
the
dignity
of
labour
there
is
something
that
might
almost
be
called
the
sanctity
of
labour
but
it
is
subject
to
the
profound
law
that
when
anything
less
than
the
highest
becomes
a
sanctity
it
tends
also
to
become
a
superstition
when
the
does
not
blow
out
his
brains
upon
the
flute
there
is
always
a
danger
that
he
may
blow
them
out
somewhere
else
owing
to
depressed
conditions
in
the
candlestick
market
now
certainly
one
of
the
first
impressions
of
america
or
at
any
rate
of
new
york
which
is
by
no
means
the
same
thing
as
america
is
that
of
a
sort
of
mob
of
business
men
behaving
in
many
ways
in
a
fashion
very
different
from
that
of
the
swarms
of
london
city
men
who
go
up
every
day
to
the
city
they
sit
about
in
groups
with
gravity
as
if
passing
the
pipe
of
peace
though
in
fact
most
of
them
are
smoking
cigars
and
some
of
them
are
eating
cigars
the
latter
strikes
me
as
one
of
the
most
peculiar
of
transatlantic
tastes
more
peculiar
than
that
of
chewing
gum
a
man
will
sit
for
hours
consuming
a
cigar
as
if
it
were
a
but
i
should
imagine
it
to
be
a
very
disagreeable
why
he
attempts
to
enjoy
a
cigar
without
lighting
it
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
a
more
economical
way
of
carrying
a
mere
symbol
of
commercial
conversation
or
whether
something
of
the
same
queer
outlandish
morality
that
draws
such
a
distinction
between
beer
and
ginger
beer
draws
an
equally
ethical
distinction
between
touching
tobacco
and
lighting
it
for
the
rest
it
would
be
easy
to
make
a
merely
external
sketch
full
of
things
equally
strange
for
this
can
always
be
done
in
a
strange
country
i
allow
for
the
fact
of
all
foreigners
looking
alike
but
i
fancy
that
all
those
faces
with
spectacles
and
shaven
jaws
do
look
rather
alike
because
they
all
like
to
make
their
faces
hard
and
with
the
mention
of
their
mental
attitude
we
realise
the
futility
of
any
such
external
sketch
unless
we
can
see
that
these
are
something
more
than
men
smoking
cigars
and
talking
about
dollars
we
had
much
better
not
see
them
at
all
it
is
customary
to
condemn
the
american
as
a
materialist
because
of
his
worship
of
success
but
indeed
this
very
worship
like
any
worship
even
proves
him
rather
a
mystic
than
a
materialist
the
frenchman
who
retires
from
business
when
he
has
money
enough
to
drink
his
wine
and
eat
his
omelette
in
peace
might
much
more
plausibly
be
called
a
materialist
by
those
who
do
not
prefer
to
call
him
a
man
of
sense
but
americans
do
worship
success
in
the
abstract
as
a
sort
of
ideal
vision
they
follow
success
rather
than
money
they
follow
money
rather
than
meat
and
drink
if
their
national
life
in
one
sense
is
a
perpetual
game
of
poker
they
are
playing
excitedly
for
chips
or
counters
as
well
as
for
coins
and
by
the
ultimate
test
of
material
enjoyment
like
the
enjoyment
of
an
omelette
even
a
coin
is
itself
a
counter
the
yankee
can
not
eat
chips
as
the
frenchman
can
eat
chipped
potatoes
but
neither
can
he
swallow
red
cents
as
the
frenchman
swallows
red
wine
thus
when
people
say
of
a
yankee
that
he
worships
the
dollar
they
pay
a
compliment
to
his
fine
spirituality
more
true
and
delicate
than
they
imagine
the
dollar
is
an
idol
because
it
is
an
image
but
it
is
an
image
of
success
and
not
of
enjoyment
that
this
romance
is
also
a
religion
is
shown
in
the
fact
that
there
is
a
queer
sort
of
morality
attached
to
it
the
nearest
parallel
to
it
is
something
like
the
sense
of
honour
in
the
old
duelling
days
there
is
not
a
material
but
a
distinctly
moral
savour
about
the
implied
obligation
to
collect
dollars
or
to
collect
chips
we
hear
too
much
in
england
of
the
phrase
about
good
for
no
sensible
englishman
favours
the
needless
interlarding
of
english
with
scraps
of
foreign
languages
but
though
it
means
nothing
in
english
it
means
something
very
particular
in
american
there
is
a
fine
shade
of
distinction
between
succeeding
and
making
good
precisely
because
there
must
always
be
a
sort
of
ethical
echo
in
the
word
good
america
does
vaguely
feel
a
man
making
good
as
something
analogous
to
a
man
being
good
or
a
man
doing
good
it
is
connected
with
his
serious
and
his
sense
of
being
worthy
of
those
he
loves
nor
is
this
curious
crude
idealism
wholly
insincere
even
when
it
drives
him
to
what
some
of
us
would
call
stealing
any
more
than
the
duellist
honour
was
insincere
when
it
drove
him
to
what
some
would
call
murder
a
very
clever
american
play
which
i
once
saw
acted
contained
a
complete
working
model
of
this
morality
a
girl
was
loyal
to
but
distressed
by
her
engagement
to
a
young
man
on
whom
there
was
a
sort
of
cloud
of
humiliation
the
atmosphere
was
exactly
what
it
would
have
been
in
england
if
he
had
been
accused
of
cowardice
or
and
there
was
nothing
whatever
the
matter
with
the
poor
young
man
except
that
some
rotten
mine
or
other
in
arizona
had
not
good
now
in
england
we
should
either
be
below
or
above
that
ideal
of
good
if
we
were
snobs
we
should
be
content
to
know
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
good
connections
perhaps
too
much
accustomed
to
private
means
to
be
expected
to
be
businesslike
if
we
were
somewhat
people
we
should
know
that
he
might
be
as
wise
as
socrates
and
as
splendid
as
bayard
and
yet
be
unfitted
perhaps
one
should
say
therefore
be
unfitted
for
the
dismal
and
dirty
gambling
of
modern
commerce
but
whether
we
were
snobbish
enough
to
admire
him
for
being
an
idler
or
chivalrous
enough
to
admire
him
for
being
an
outlaw
in
neither
case
should
we
ever
really
and
in
our
hearts
despise
him
for
being
a
failure
for
it
is
this
inner
verdict
of
instinctive
idealism
that
is
the
point
at
issue
of
course
there
is
nothing
new
or
peculiar
to
the
new
world
about
a
man
engagement
practically
failing
through
his
financial
failure
an
english
girl
might
easily
drop
a
man
because
he
was
poor
or
she
might
stick
to
him
faithfully
and
defiantly
although
he
was
poor
the
point
is
that
this
girl
was
faithful
but
she
was
not
defiant
that
is
she
was
not
proud
the
whole
psychology
of
the
situation
was
that
she
shared
the
weird
worldly
idealism
of
her
family
and
it
was
wounded
as
her
patriotism
would
have
been
wounded
if
he
had
betrayed
his
country
to
do
them
justice
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
they
would
have
had
any
real
respect
for
a
royal
duke
who
had
inherited
millions
what
the
simple
barbarians
wanted
was
a
man
who
could
good
that
the
process
of
making
good
would
probably
drag
him
through
the
mire
of
everything
bad
that
he
would
make
good
by
bluffing
lying
swindling
and
grinding
the
faces
of
the
poor
did
not
seem
to
trouble
them
in
the
least
against
this
fanaticism
there
is
this
shadow
of
truth
even
in
the
fiction
of
aristocracy
that
a
gentleman
may
at
least
be
allowed
to
be
good
without
being
bothered
to
make
it
another
objection
to
the
phrase
about
the
almighty
dollar
is
that
it
is
an
almighty
phrase
and
therefore
an
almighty
nuisance
i
mean
that
it
is
made
to
explain
everything
and
to
explain
everything
much
too
well
that
is
much
too
easily
it
does
not
really
help
people
to
understand
a
foreign
country
but
it
gives
them
the
fatal
illusion
that
they
do
understand
it
dollars
stood
for
america
as
frogs
stood
for
france
because
it
was
necessary
to
connect
particular
foreigners
with
something
or
it
would
be
so
easy
to
confuse
a
moor
with
a
montenegrin
or
a
russian
with
a
red
indian
the
only
cure
for
this
sort
of
satisfied
familiarity
is
the
shock
of
something
really
unfamiliar
when
people
can
see
nothing
at
all
in
american
democracy
except
a
yankee
running
after
a
dollar
then
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
trip
them
up
as
they
run
after
the
yankee
or
run
away
with
their
notion
of
the
yankee
by
the
obstacle
of
certain
odd
and
obstinate
facts
that
have
no
relation
to
that
notion
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
a
number
of
such
obstacles
to
any
such
generalisation
a
number
of
notable
facts
that
have
to
be
reconciled
somehow
to
our
previous
notions
it
does
not
matter
for
this
purpose
whether
the
facts
are
favourable
or
unfavourable
or
whether
the
qualities
are
merits
or
defects
especially
as
we
do
not
even
understand
them
sufficiently
to
say
which
they
are
the
point
is
that
we
are
brought
to
a
pause
and
compelled
to
attempt
to
understand
them
rather
better
than
we
do
we
have
found
the
one
thing
that
we
did
not
expect
and
therefore
the
one
thing
that
we
can
not
explain
and
we
are
moved
to
an
effort
probably
an
unsuccessful
effort
to
explain
it
for
instance
americans
are
very
unpunctual
that
is
the
last
thing
that
a
critic
expects
who
comes
to
condemn
them
for
hustling
and
haggling
and
vulgar
ambition
but
it
is
almost
the
first
fact
that
strikes
the
spectator
on
the
spot
the
chief
difference
between
the
humdrum
english
business
man
and
the
hustling
american
business
man
is
that
the
hustling
american
business
man
is
always
late
of
course
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
coming
late
and
coming
too
late
but
i
noticed
the
fashion
first
in
connection
with
my
own
lectures
touching
which
i
could
heartily
recommend
the
habit
of
coming
too
late
i
could
easily
understand
a
crowd
of
commercial
americans
not
coming
to
my
lectures
at
all
but
there
was
something
odd
about
their
coming
in
a
crowd
and
the
crowd
being
expected
to
turn
up
some
time
after
the
appointed
hour
the
managers
of
these
lectures
i
continue
to
call
them
lectures
out
of
courtesy
to
myself
often
explained
to
me
that
it
was
quite
useless
to
begin
properly
until
about
half
an
hour
after
time
often
people
were
still
coming
in
of
an
hour
or
even
an
hour
after
time
not
that
i
objected
to
that
as
some
lecturers
are
said
to
do
it
seemed
to
me
an
agreeable
break
in
the
monotony
but
as
a
characteristic
of
a
people
mostly
engaged
in
practical
business
it
struck
me
as
curious
and
interesting
i
have
grown
accustomed
to
being
the
most
unbusinesslike
person
in
any
given
company
and
it
gave
me
a
sort
of
dizzy
exaltation
to
find
i
was
not
the
most
unpunctual
person
in
that
company
i
was
afterwards
told
by
many
americans
that
my
impression
was
quite
correct
that
american
unpunctuality
was
really
very
prevalent
and
extended
to
much
more
important
things
but
at
least
i
was
not
content
to
lump
this
along
with
all
sorts
of
contrary
things
that
i
did
not
happen
to
like
and
call
it
america
i
am
not
sure
of
what
it
really
means
but
i
rather
fancy
that
though
it
may
seem
the
very
reverse
of
the
hustling
it
has
the
same
origin
as
the
hustling
the
american
is
not
punctual
because
he
is
not
punctilious
he
is
impulsive
and
has
an
impulse
to
stay
as
well
as
an
impulse
to
go
for
after
all
punctuality
belongs
to
the
same
order
of
ideas
as
punctuation
and
there
is
no
punctuation
in
telegrams
the
order
of
clocks
and
set
hours
which
english
business
has
always
observed
is
a
good
thing
in
its
own
way
indeed
i
think
that
in
a
larger
sense
it
is
better
than
the
other
way
but
it
is
better
because
it
is
a
protection
against
hustling
not
a
promotion
of
it
in
other
words
it
is
better
because
it
is
more
civilised
as
a
great
venetian
merchant
prince
clad
in
cloth
of
gold
was
more
civilised
or
an
old
english
merchant
drinking
port
in
an
room
was
more
civilised
or
a
little
french
shopkeeper
shutting
up
his
shop
to
play
dominoes
is
more
civilised
and
the
reason
is
that
the
american
has
the
romance
of
business
and
is
monomaniac
while
the
frenchman
has
the
romance
of
life
and
is
sane
but
the
romance
of
business
really
is
a
romance
and
the
americans
are
really
romantic
about
it
and
that
romance
though
it
revolves
round
pork
or
petrol
is
really
like
a
in
this
that
it
involves
not
only
rushing
but
also
lingering
the
american
is
too
busy
to
have
business
habits
he
is
also
too
much
in
earnest
to
have
business
rules
if
we
wish
to
understand
him
we
must
compare
him
not
with
the
french
shopkeeper
when
he
plays
dominoes
but
with
the
same
french
shopkeeper
when
he
works
the
guns
or
mans
the
trenches
as
a
conscript
soldier
everybody
used
to
the
punctilious
prussian
standard
of
uniform
and
parade
has
noticed
the
roughness
and
apparent
laxity
of
the
french
soldier
the
looseness
of
his
clothes
the
unsightliness
of
his
heavy
knapsack
in
short
his
inferiority
in
every
detail
of
the
business
of
war
except
fighting
there
he
is
much
too
swift
to
be
smart
he
is
much
too
practical
to
be
precise
by
a
strange
illusion
which
can
lift
almost
to
the
level
of
patriotism
the
american
has
the
same
free
rhythm
in
his
romance
of
business
he
varies
his
conduct
not
to
suit
the
clock
but
to
suit
the
case
he
gives
more
time
to
more
important
and
less
time
to
less
important
things
and
he
makes
up
his
as
he
goes
along
suppose
he
has
three
appointments
the
first
let
us
say
is
some
mere
trifle
of
erecting
a
tower
twenty
storeys
high
and
exhibiting
a
on
the
top
of
it
the
second
is
a
business
discussion
about
the
possibility
of
printing
advertisements
of
soft
drinks
on
the
at
a
restaurant
the
third
is
attending
a
conference
to
decide
how
the
populace
can
be
prevented
from
using
and
the
manufacturers
can
still
manage
to
sell
it
he
will
be
content
merely
to
glance
at
the
as
he
goes
by
in
a
or
an
automobile
he
will
then
settle
down
to
the
discussion
with
his
partner
about
the
each
speaker
indulging
in
long
monologues
in
turn
a
peculiarity
of
much
american
conversation
now
if
in
the
middle
of
one
of
these
monologues
he
suddenly
thinks
that
the
vacant
space
of
the
waiter
might
also
be
utilised
to
advertise
the
gee
whiz
ginger
champagne
he
will
instantly
follow
up
the
new
idea
in
all
its
aspects
and
possibilities
in
an
even
longer
monologue
and
will
never
think
of
looking
at
his
watch
while
he
is
rapturously
looking
at
his
waiter
the
consequence
is
that
he
will
come
late
into
the
great
social
movement
against
where
an
englishman
would
probably
have
arrived
at
the
proper
hour
but
though
the
englishman
conduct
is
more
proper
it
need
not
be
in
all
respects
more
practical
the
englishman
rules
are
better
for
the
business
of
life
but
not
necessarily
for
the
life
of
business
and
it
is
true
that
for
many
of
these
americans
business
is
the
business
of
life
it
is
really
also
as
i
have
said
the
romance
of
life
we
shall
admire
or
deplore
this
spirit
accordingly
as
we
are
glad
to
see
trade
irradiated
with
so
much
poetry
or
sorry
to
see
so
much
poetry
wasted
on
trade
but
it
does
make
many
people
happy
like
any
other
hobby
and
one
is
disposed
to
add
that
it
does
fill
their
imaginations
like
any
other
delusion
for
the
true
criticism
of
all
this
commercial
romance
would
involve
a
criticism
of
this
historic
phase
of
commerce
these
people
are
building
on
the
sand
though
it
shines
like
gold
and
for
them
like
fairy
gold
but
the
world
will
remember
the
legend
about
fairy
gold
half
the
financial
operations
they
follow
deal
with
things
that
do
not
even
exist
for
in
that
sense
all
finance
is
a
fairy
tale
many
of
them
are
buying
and
selling
things
that
do
nothing
but
harm
but
it
does
them
good
to
buy
and
sell
them
the
claim
of
the
romantic
salesman
is
better
justified
than
he
realises
business
really
is
romance
for
it
is
not
reality
there
is
one
real
advantage
that
america
has
over
england
largely
due
to
its
livelier
and
more
impressionable
ideal
america
does
not
think
that
stupidity
is
practical
it
does
not
think
that
ideas
are
merely
destructive
things
it
does
not
think
that
a
genius
is
only
a
person
to
be
told
to
go
away
and
blow
his
brains
out
rather
it
would
open
all
its
machinery
to
the
genius
and
beg
him
to
blow
his
brains
in
it
might
attempt
to
use
a
natural
force
like
blake
or
shelley
for
very
ignoble
purposes
it
would
be
quite
capable
of
asking
blake
to
take
his
tiger
and
his
golden
lions
round
as
a
sort
of
barnum
show
or
shelley
to
hang
his
stars
and
haloed
clouds
among
the
lights
of
broadway
but
it
would
not
assume
that
a
natural
force
is
useless
any
more
than
that
niagara
is
useless
and
there
is
a
very
definite
distinction
here
touching
the
intelligence
of
the
trader
whatever
we
may
think
of
either
course
touching
the
intelligence
of
the
artist
it
is
one
thing
that
apollo
should
be
employed
by
admetus
although
he
is
a
god
it
is
quite
another
thing
that
apollo
should
always
be
sacked
by
admetus
because
he
is
a
god
now
in
england
largely
owing
to
the
accident
of
a
rivalry
and
therefore
a
comparison
with
france
there
arose
about
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
an
extraordinary
notion
that
there
was
some
sort
of
connection
between
dullness
and
success
what
the
americans
call
a
bonehead
became
what
the
english
call
a
man
the
merchants
of
london
evinced
their
contempt
for
the
fantastic
logicians
of
paris
by
living
in
a
permanent
state
of
terror
lest
somebody
should
set
the
thames
on
fire
in
this
as
in
much
else
it
is
much
easier
to
understand
the
americans
if
we
connect
them
with
the
french
who
were
their
allies
than
with
the
english
who
were
their
enemies
there
are
a
great
many
resemblances
which
the
practical
are
of
course
too
or
boneheaded
to
see
american
history
is
haunted
with
the
shadow
of
the
plebiscitary
president
they
have
a
tradition
of
classical
architecture
for
public
buildings
their
cities
are
planned
upon
the
squares
of
paris
and
not
upon
the
labyrinth
of
london
they
call
their
cities
corinth
and
syracuse
as
the
french
called
their
citizens
epaminondas
and
timoleon
their
soldiers
wore
the
french
kepi
and
they
make
coffee
admirably
and
do
not
make
tea
at
all
but
of
all
the
french
elements
in
america
the
most
french
is
this
real
practicality
they
know
that
at
certain
times
the
most
businesslike
of
all
qualities
is
et
encore
de
et
toujours
de
the
publisher
may
induce
the
poet
to
do
a
but
the
publisher
would
cheerfully
allow
the
poet
to
set
the
mississippi
on
fire
if
it
would
boil
his
particular
pot
it
is
not
so
much
that
englishmen
are
stupid
as
that
they
are
afraid
of
being
clever
and
it
is
not
so
much
that
americans
are
clever
as
that
they
do
not
try
to
be
any
stupider
than
they
are
the
fire
of
french
logic
has
burnt
that
out
of
america
as
it
has
burnt
it
out
of
europe
and
of
almost
every
place
except
england
this
is
one
of
the
few
points
on
which
english
insularity
really
is
a
disadvantage
it
is
the
fatal
notion
that
the
only
sort
of
commonsense
is
to
be
found
in
compromise
and
that
the
only
sort
of
compromise
is
to
be
found
in
confusion
this
must
be
clearly
distinguished
from
the
commonplace
about
the
utilitarian
world
not
rising
to
the
invisible
values
of
genius
under
this
philosophy
the
utilitarian
does
not
see
the
utility
of
genius
even
when
it
is
quite
visible
he
does
not
see
it
not
because
he
is
a
utilitarian
but
because
he
is
an
idealist
whose
ideal
is
dullness
for
some
time
the
english
aspired
to
be
stupid
prayed
and
hoped
with
soaring
spiritual
ambition
to
be
stupid
but
with
all
their
worship
of
success
they
did
not
succeed
in
being
stupid
the
natural
talents
of
a
great
and
traditional
nation
were
always
breaking
out
in
spite
of
them
in
spite
of
the
merchants
of
london
turner
did
set
the
thames
on
fire
in
spite
of
our
repeatedly
explained
preference
for
realism
to
romance
europe
persisted
in
resounding
with
the
name
of
byron
and
just
when
we
had
made
it
perfectly
clear
to
the
french
that
we
despised
all
their
flamboyant
tricks
that
we
were
a
plain
prosaic
people
and
there
was
no
fantastic
glory
or
chivalry
about
us
the
very
shaft
we
sent
against
them
shone
with
the
name
of
nelson
a
shooting
and
a
falling
star
and
all
good
americans
wish
to
fight
the
representatives
they
have
chosen
all
good
englishmen
wish
to
forget
the
representatives
they
have
chosen
this
difference
deep
and
perhaps
ineradicable
in
the
temperaments
of
the
two
peoples
explains
a
thousand
things
in
their
literature
and
their
laws
the
american
national
poet
praised
his
people
for
their
readiness
against
the
audacity
of
elected
persons
the
english
national
anthem
is
content
to
say
heartily
but
almost
hastily
their
politics
and
then
more
cheerfully
as
if
changing
the
subject
save
the
king
for
this
is
especially
the
secret
of
the
monarch
or
chief
magistrate
in
the
two
countries
they
arm
the
president
with
the
powers
of
a
king
that
he
may
be
a
nuisance
in
politics
we
deprive
the
king
even
of
the
powers
of
a
president
lest
he
should
remind
us
of
a
politician
we
desire
to
forget
the
audacity
of
elected
persons
and
with
us
therefore
it
really
never
does
end
that
is
the
practical
objection
to
our
own
habit
of
changing
the
subject
instead
of
changing
the
ministry
the
king
as
the
irish
wit
observed
is
not
a
subject
but
in
that
sense
the
english
crowned
head
is
not
a
king
he
is
a
popular
figure
intended
to
remind
us
of
the
england
that
politicians
do
not
remember
the
england
of
horses
and
ships
and
gardens
and
good
fellowship
the
americans
have
no
such
purely
social
symbol
and
it
is
rather
the
root
than
the
result
of
this
that
their
social
luxury
and
especially
their
sport
are
a
little
lacking
in
humanity
and
humour
it
is
the
american
much
more
than
the
englishman
who
takes
his
pleasures
sadly
not
to
say
savagely
the
genuine
popularity
of
constitutional
monarchs
in
parliamentary
countries
can
be
explained
by
any
practical
example
let
us
suppose
that
great
social
reform
the
compulsory
haircutting
act
has
just
begun
to
be
enforced
the
compulsory
haircutting
act
as
every
good
citizen
knows
is
a
statute
which
permits
any
person
to
grow
his
hair
to
any
length
in
any
wild
or
wonderful
shape
so
long
as
he
is
registered
with
a
hairdresser
who
charges
a
shilling
but
it
imposes
a
universal
like
that
which
is
found
so
hygienic
during
a
curative
detention
at
dartmoor
on
all
who
are
registered
only
with
a
barber
who
charges
threepence
thus
while
the
ornamental
classes
can
continue
to
ornament
the
street
with
piccadilly
weepers
or
if
they
choose
the
working
classes
demonstrate
the
care
with
which
the
state
protects
them
by
going
about
in
a
fresher
cooler
and
cleaner
condition
a
condition
which
has
the
further
advantage
of
revealing
at
a
glance
that
outline
of
the
criminal
skull
which
is
so
common
among
them
the
compulsory
haircutting
act
is
thus
in
every
way
a
compact
and
convenient
example
of
all
our
current
laws
about
education
sport
liquor
and
liberty
in
general
well
the
law
has
passed
and
the
masses
insensible
to
its
scientific
value
are
still
murmuring
against
it
the
ignorant
peasant
maiden
is
averse
to
so
extreme
a
fashion
of
bobbing
her
hair
and
does
not
see
how
she
can
even
be
a
flapper
with
nothing
to
flap
her
father
his
mind
already
poisoned
by
bolshevists
begins
to
wonder
who
the
devil
does
these
things
and
why
in
proportion
as
he
knows
the
world
of
he
guesses
that
the
real
origin
may
be
quite
obscure
or
the
real
motive
quite
corrupt
the
pressure
may
have
come
from
anybody
who
has
gained
power
or
money
anyhow
it
may
come
from
the
foreign
millionaire
who
owns
all
the
expensive
hairdressing
saloons
it
may
come
from
some
swindler
in
the
cutlery
trade
who
has
contracted
to
sell
a
million
bad
razors
hence
the
poor
man
looks
about
him
with
suspicion
in
the
street
knowing
that
the
lowest
sneak
or
the
loudest
snob
he
sees
may
be
directing
the
government
of
his
country
anybody
may
have
to
do
with
politics
and
this
sort
of
thing
is
politics
suddenly
he
catches
sight
of
a
crowd
stops
and
begins
wildly
to
cheer
a
carriage
that
is
passing
the
carriage
contains
the
one
person
who
has
certainly
not
originated
any
great
scientific
reform
he
is
the
only
person
in
the
commonwealth
who
is
not
allowed
to
cut
off
other
hair
or
to
take
away
other
people
liberties
he
at
least
is
kept
out
of
politics
and
men
hold
him
up
as
they
did
an
unspotted
victim
to
appease
the
wrath
of
the
gods
he
is
their
king
and
the
only
man
they
know
is
not
their
ruler
we
need
not
be
surprised
that
he
is
popular
knowing
how
they
are
ruled
the
popularity
of
a
president
in
america
is
exactly
the
opposite
the
american
republic
is
the
last
mediaeval
monarchy
it
is
intended
that
the
president
shall
rule
and
take
all
the
risks
of
ruling
if
the
hair
is
cut
he
is
the
haircutter
the
magistrate
that
bears
not
the
razor
in
vain
all
the
popular
presidents
jackson
and
lincoln
and
roosevelt
have
acted
as
democratic
despots
but
emphatically
not
as
constitutional
monarchs
in
short
the
names
have
become
curiously
interchanged
and
as
a
historical
reality
it
is
the
president
who
ought
to
be
called
a
king
but
it
is
not
only
true
that
the
president
could
correctly
be
called
a
king
it
is
also
true
that
the
king
might
correctly
be
called
a
president
we
could
hardly
find
a
more
exact
description
of
him
than
to
call
him
a
president
what
is
expected
in
modern
times
of
a
modern
constitutional
monarch
is
emphatically
that
he
should
preside
we
expect
him
to
take
the
throne
exactly
as
if
he
were
taking
the
chair
the
chairman
does
not
move
the
motion
or
resolution
far
less
vote
it
he
is
not
supposed
even
to
favour
it
he
is
expected
to
please
everybody
by
favouring
nobody
the
primary
essentials
of
a
president
or
chairman
are
that
he
should
be
treated
with
ceremonial
respect
that
he
should
be
popular
in
his
personality
and
yet
impersonal
in
his
opinions
and
that
he
should
actually
be
a
link
between
all
the
other
persons
by
being
different
from
all
of
them
this
is
exactly
what
is
demanded
of
the
constitutional
monarch
in
modern
times
it
is
exactly
the
opposite
to
the
american
position
in
which
the
president
does
not
preside
at
all
he
moves
and
the
thing
he
moves
may
truly
be
called
a
motion
for
the
national
idea
is
perpetual
motion
technically
it
is
called
a
message
and
might
often
actually
be
called
a
menace
thus
we
may
truly
say
that
the
king
presides
and
the
president
reigns
some
would
prefer
to
say
that
the
president
rules
and
some
senators
and
members
of
congress
would
prefer
to
say
that
he
rebels
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
moves
he
does
not
take
the
chair
or
even
the
stool
but
rather
the
stump
some
people
seem
to
suppose
that
the
fall
of
president
wilson
was
a
denial
of
this
almost
despotic
ideal
in
america
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
the
strongest
possible
assertion
of
it
the
idea
is
that
the
president
shall
take
responsibility
and
risk
and
responsibility
means
being
blamed
and
risk
means
the
risk
of
being
blamed
the
theory
is
that
things
are
done
by
the
president
and
if
things
go
wrong
or
are
alleged
to
go
wrong
it
is
the
fault
of
the
president
this
does
not
invalidate
but
rather
ratifies
the
comparison
with
true
monarchs
such
as
the
mediaeval
monarchs
constitutional
princes
are
seldom
deposed
but
despots
were
often
deposed
in
the
simpler
races
of
sunnier
lands
such
as
turkey
they
were
commonly
assassinated
even
in
our
own
history
a
king
often
received
the
same
respectful
tribute
to
the
responsibility
and
reality
of
his
office
but
king
john
was
attacked
because
he
was
strong
not
because
he
was
weak
richard
the
second
lost
the
crown
because
the
crown
was
a
trophy
not
because
it
was
a
trifle
and
president
wilson
was
deposed
because
he
had
used
a
power
which
is
such
in
its
nature
that
a
man
must
use
it
at
the
risk
of
deposition
as
a
matter
of
fact
of
course
it
is
easy
to
exaggerate
wilson
real
unpopularity
and
still
more
easy
to
exaggerate
wilson
real
failure
there
are
a
great
many
people
in
america
who
justify
and
applaud
him
and
what
is
yet
more
interesting
who
justify
him
not
on
pacifist
and
idealistic
but
on
patriotic
and
even
military
grounds
it
is
especially
insisted
by
some
that
his
demonstration
which
seemed
futile
as
a
threat
against
mexico
was
a
very
preparation
for
the
threat
against
prussia
but
in
so
far
as
the
democracy
did
disagree
with
him
it
was
but
the
occasional
and
inevitable
result
of
the
theory
by
which
the
despot
has
to
anticipate
the
democracy
thus
the
american
king
and
the
english
president
are
the
very
opposite
of
each
other
yet
they
are
both
the
varied
and
very
national
indications
of
the
same
contemporary
truth
it
is
the
great
weariness
and
contempt
that
have
fallen
upon
common
politics
in
both
countries
it
may
be
answered
with
some
show
of
truth
that
the
new
american
president
represents
a
return
to
common
politics
and
that
in
that
sense
he
marks
a
real
rebuke
to
the
last
president
and
his
more
uncommon
politics
and
it
is
true
that
many
who
put
harding
in
power
regard
him
as
the
symbol
of
something
which
they
call
normalcy
which
may
roughly
be
translated
into
english
by
the
word
normality
and
by
this
they
do
mean
more
or
less
the
return
to
the
vague
capitalist
conservatism
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
might
call
harding
a
victorian
if
they
had
ever
lived
under
victoria
perhaps
these
people
do
entertain
the
extraordinary
notion
that
the
nineteenth
century
was
normal
but
there
are
very
few
who
think
so
and
even
they
will
not
think
so
long
the
blunder
is
the
beginning
of
nearly
all
our
present
troubles
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
very
reverse
of
normal
it
suffered
a
most
unnatural
strain
in
the
combination
of
political
equality
in
theory
with
extreme
economic
inequality
in
practice
capitalism
was
not
a
normalcy
but
an
abnormalcy
property
is
normal
and
is
more
normal
in
proportion
as
it
is
universal
slavery
may
be
normal
and
even
natural
in
the
sense
that
a
bad
habit
may
be
second
nature
but
capitalism
was
never
anything
so
human
as
a
habit
we
may
say
it
was
never
anything
so
good
as
a
bad
habit
it
was
never
a
custom
for
men
never
grew
accustomed
to
it
it
was
never
even
conservative
for
before
it
was
even
created
wise
men
had
realised
that
it
could
not
be
conserved
it
was
from
the
first
a
problem
and
those
who
will
not
even
admit
the
capitalist
problem
deserve
to
get
the
bolshevist
solution
all
things
considered
i
can
not
say
anything
worse
of
them
than
that
the
recent
presidential
election
preserved
some
trace
of
the
old
party
system
of
america
but
its
tradition
has
very
nearly
faded
like
that
of
the
party
system
of
england
it
is
easy
for
an
englishman
to
confess
that
he
never
quite
understood
the
american
party
system
it
would
perhaps
be
more
courageous
in
him
and
more
informing
to
confess
that
he
never
really
understood
the
british
party
system
the
planks
in
the
two
american
platforms
may
easily
be
exhibited
as
very
disconnected
and
ramshackle
but
our
own
party
was
as
much
of
a
patchwork
and
indeed
i
think
even
more
so
everybody
knows
that
the
two
american
factions
were
called
and
it
does
not
at
all
cover
the
case
to
identify
the
former
with
liberals
and
the
latter
with
conservatives
the
democrats
are
the
party
of
the
south
and
have
some
true
tradition
from
the
southern
aristocracy
and
the
defence
of
secession
and
state
rights
the
republicans
rose
in
the
north
as
the
party
of
lincoln
largely
condemning
slavery
but
the
republicans
are
also
the
party
of
tariffs
and
are
at
least
accused
of
being
the
party
of
trusts
the
democrats
are
the
party
of
free
trade
and
in
the
great
movement
of
twenty
years
ago
the
party
of
free
silver
the
democrats
are
also
the
party
of
the
irish
and
the
stones
they
throw
at
trusts
are
retorted
by
stones
thrown
at
tammany
it
is
easy
to
see
all
these
things
as
curiously
sporadic
and
bewildering
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
they
are
as
a
whole
more
coherent
and
rational
than
our
own
old
division
of
liberals
and
conservatives
there
is
even
more
doubt
nowadays
about
what
is
the
connecting
link
between
the
different
items
in
the
old
british
party
programmes
i
have
never
been
able
to
understand
why
being
in
favour
of
protection
should
have
anything
to
do
with
being
opposed
to
home
rule
especially
as
most
of
the
people
who
were
to
receive
home
rule
were
themselves
in
favour
of
protection
i
could
never
see
what
giving
people
cheap
bread
had
to
do
with
forbidding
them
cheap
beer
or
why
the
party
which
sympathises
with
ireland
can
not
sympathise
with
poland
i
can
not
see
why
liberals
did
not
liberate
or
conservatives
conserve
crofters
i
do
not
understand
the
principle
upon
which
the
causes
were
selected
on
both
sides
and
i
incline
to
think
that
it
was
with
the
impartial
object
of
distributing
nonsense
equally
on
both
sides
heaven
knows
there
is
enough
nonsense
in
american
politics
too
towering
and
tropical
nonsense
like
a
cyclone
or
an
earthquake
but
when
all
is
said
i
incline
to
think
that
there
was
more
spiritual
and
atmospheric
cohesion
in
the
different
parts
of
the
american
party
than
in
those
of
the
english
party
and
i
think
this
unity
was
all
the
more
real
because
it
was
more
difficult
to
define
the
republican
party
originally
stood
for
the
triumph
of
the
north
and
the
north
stood
for
the
nineteenth
century
that
is
for
the
characteristic
commercial
expansion
of
the
nineteenth
century
for
a
firm
faith
in
the
profit
and
progress
of
its
great
and
growing
cities
its
division
of
labour
its
industrial
science
and
its
evolutionary
reform
the
democratic
party
stood
more
loosely
for
all
the
elements
that
doubted
whether
this
development
was
democratic
or
was
desirable
all
that
looked
back
to
jeffersonian
idealism
and
the
serene
abstractions
of
the
eighteenth
century
or
forward
to
bryanite
idealism
and
some
simplified
utopia
founded
on
grain
rather
than
gold
along
with
this
went
not
at
all
unnaturally
the
last
and
lingering
sentiment
of
the
southern
squires
who
remembered
a
more
rural
civilisation
that
seemed
by
comparison
romantic
along
with
this
went
quite
logically
the
passions
and
the
pathos
of
the
irish
themselves
a
rural
civilisation
whose
basis
is
a
religion
or
what
the
nineteenth
century
tended
to
call
a
superstition
above
all
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
this
tone
of
thought
should
favour
local
liberties
and
even
a
revolt
on
behalf
of
local
liberties
and
should
distrust
the
huge
machine
of
centralised
power
called
the
union
in
short
something
very
near
the
truth
was
said
by
a
suicidally
silly
republican
orator
who
was
running
blaine
for
the
presidency
when
he
denounced
the
democratic
party
as
supported
by
rum
and
rebellion
they
seem
to
me
to
be
three
excellent
things
in
their
place
and
that
is
why
i
suspect
that
i
should
have
belonged
to
the
democratic
party
if
i
had
been
born
in
america
when
there
was
a
democratic
party
but
i
fancy
that
by
this
time
even
this
general
distinction
has
become
very
dim
if
i
had
been
an
american
twenty
years
ago
in
the
time
of
the
great
free
silver
campaign
i
should
certainly
never
have
hesitated
for
an
instant
about
my
sympathies
or
my
side
my
feelings
would
have
been
exactly
those
that
are
nobly
expressed
by
vachell
lindsay
in
a
poem
bearing
the
characteristic
title
of
bryan
bryan
bryan
and
by
the
way
nobody
can
begin
to
sympathise
with
america
whose
soul
does
not
to
some
extent
begin
to
swing
and
dance
to
the
drums
and
gongs
of
vachell
lindsay
great
orchestra
which
has
the
note
of
his
whole
nation
in
this
that
a
refined
person
can
revile
it
a
hundred
times
over
as
violent
and
brazen
and
barbarous
and
absurd
but
not
as
insincere
there
is
something
in
it
and
that
something
is
the
soul
of
many
million
men
but
the
poet
himself
in
the
political
poem
referred
to
speaks
of
bryan
fall
over
free
silver
as
of
my
boyhood
defeat
of
my
dream
and
it
is
only
too
probable
that
the
cause
has
fallen
as
well
as
the
candidate
the
william
jennings
bryan
of
later
years
is
not
the
man
whom
i
should
have
seen
in
my
youth
with
the
visionary
eyes
of
vachell
lindsay
he
has
become
a
commonplace
pacifist
which
is
in
its
nature
the
very
opposite
of
a
revolutionist
for
if
men
will
fight
rather
than
sacrifice
humanity
on
a
golden
cross
it
can
not
be
wrong
for
them
to
resist
its
being
sacrificed
to
an
iron
cross
i
came
into
very
indirect
contact
with
bryan
when
i
was
in
america
in
a
fashion
that
made
me
realise
how
hard
it
has
become
to
recover
the
illusions
of
a
bryanite
i
believe
that
my
lecture
agent
was
anxious
to
arrange
a
debate
and
i
threw
out
a
sort
of
loose
challenge
to
the
effect
that
woman
suffrage
had
weakened
the
position
of
woman
and
while
i
was
away
in
the
wilds
of
oklahoma
my
lecture
agent
a
man
of
courage
and
enterprise
asked
bryan
to
debate
with
me
now
bryan
is
one
of
the
greatest
orators
of
modern
history
and
there
is
no
conceivable
reason
why
he
should
trouble
to
debate
with
a
wandering
lecturer
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
expressed
himself
in
the
most
magnanimous
and
courteous
terms
about
my
personal
position
but
said
as
i
understood
that
it
would
be
improper
to
debate
on
female
suffrage
as
it
was
already
a
part
of
the
political
system
and
when
i
heard
that
i
could
not
help
a
sigh
for
i
recognised
something
that
i
knew
only
too
well
on
the
front
benches
of
my
own
beloved
land
the
great
and
glorious
demagogue
had
degenerated
into
a
statesman
i
had
never
expected
for
a
moment
that
the
great
orator
could
be
bothered
to
debate
with
me
at
all
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
as
a
general
moral
principle
that
two
educated
men
were
for
ever
forbidden
to
talk
sense
about
a
particular
topic
because
a
lot
of
other
people
had
already
voted
on
it
what
is
the
matter
with
that
attitude
is
the
loss
of
the
freedom
of
the
mind
there
can
be
no
liberty
of
thought
unless
it
is
ready
to
unsettle
what
has
recently
been
settled
as
well
as
what
has
long
been
settled
we
are
perpetually
being
told
in
the
papers
that
what
is
wanted
is
a
strong
man
who
will
do
things
what
is
wanted
is
a
strong
man
who
will
undo
things
and
that
will
be
a
real
test
of
strength
anyhow
we
could
have
believed
in
the
time
of
the
free
silver
fight
that
the
democratic
party
was
democratic
with
a
small
in
wilson
it
was
transfigured
his
friends
would
say
into
a
higher
and
his
foes
into
a
hazier
thing
and
the
republican
reaction
against
him
even
where
it
has
been
healthy
has
also
been
hazy
in
fact
it
has
been
not
so
much
the
victory
of
a
political
party
as
a
relapse
into
repose
after
certain
political
passions
and
in
that
sense
there
is
a
truth
in
the
strange
phrase
about
normalcy
in
the
sense
that
there
is
nothing
more
normal
than
going
to
sleep
but
an
even
larger
truth
is
this
it
is
most
likely
that
america
is
no
longer
concentrated
on
these
faction
fights
at
all
but
is
considering
certain
large
problems
upon
which
those
factions
hardly
troubled
to
take
sides
they
are
too
large
even
to
be
classified
as
foreign
policy
distinct
from
domestic
policy
they
are
so
large
as
to
be
inside
as
well
as
outside
the
state
from
an
english
standpoint
the
most
obvious
example
is
the
irish
for
the
irish
problem
is
not
a
british
problem
but
also
an
american
problem
and
this
is
true
even
of
the
great
external
enigma
of
japan
the
japanese
question
may
be
a
part
of
foreign
policy
for
america
but
it
is
a
part
of
domestic
policy
for
california
and
the
same
is
true
of
that
other
intense
and
intelligent
eastern
people
the
genius
and
limitations
of
which
have
troubled
the
world
so
much
longer
what
the
japs
are
in
california
the
jews
are
in
america
that
is
they
are
a
piece
of
foreign
policy
that
has
become
imbedded
in
domestic
policy
something
which
is
found
inside
but
still
has
to
be
regarded
from
the
outside
on
these
great
international
matters
i
doubt
if
americans
got
much
guidance
from
their
party
system
especially
as
most
of
these
questions
have
grown
very
recently
and
rapidly
to
enormous
size
men
are
left
free
to
judge
of
them
with
fresh
minds
and
that
is
the
truth
in
the
statement
that
the
washington
conference
has
opened
the
gates
of
a
new
world
on
the
relations
to
england
and
ireland
i
will
not
attempt
to
dwell
adequately
here
i
have
already
noted
that
my
first
interview
was
with
an
irishman
and
my
first
impression
from
that
interview
a
vivid
sense
of
the
importance
of
ireland
in
relations
and
i
have
said
something
of
the
irish
problem
prematurely
and
out
of
its
proper
order
under
the
stress
of
that
sense
of
urgency
here
i
will
only
add
two
remarks
about
the
two
countries
respectively
a
great
many
british
journalists
have
recently
imagined
that
they
were
pouring
oil
upon
the
troubled
waters
when
they
were
rather
pouring
out
oil
to
smooth
the
downward
path
and
to
turn
the
broad
road
to
destruction
into
a
they
seem
to
have
no
notion
of
what
to
do
except
to
say
what
they
imagine
the
very
stupidest
of
their
readers
would
be
pleased
to
hear
and
conceal
whatever
the
most
intelligent
of
their
readers
would
probably
like
to
know
they
therefore
informed
the
public
that
majority
of
americans
had
abandoned
all
sympathy
with
ireland
because
of
its
alleged
sympathy
with
germany
and
that
this
majority
of
americans
was
now
ardently
in
sympathy
with
its
english
brothers
across
the
sea
now
to
begin
with
such
critics
have
no
notion
of
what
they
are
saying
when
they
talk
about
the
majority
of
americans
to
anybody
who
has
happened
to
look
in
let
us
say
on
the
city
of
omaha
nebraska
the
remark
will
have
something
enormous
and
overwhelming
about
it
it
is
like
saying
that
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
china
would
agree
with
the
chinese
ambassador
in
a
preference
for
dining
at
the
savoy
rather
than
the
ritz
there
are
millions
and
millions
of
people
living
in
those
great
central
plains
of
the
north
american
continent
of
whom
it
would
be
nearer
the
truth
to
say
that
they
have
never
heard
of
england
or
of
ireland
either
than
to
say
that
their
first
emotional
movement
is
a
desire
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
either
of
them
it
is
perfectly
true
that
the
more
monomaniac
sort
of
sinn
feiner
might
sometimes
irritate
this
innocent
and
isolated
american
spirit
by
being
it
is
equally
true
that
a
traditional
bostonian
or
virginian
might
irritate
it
by
being
the
only
difference
is
that
large
numbers
of
pure
irishmen
are
scattered
in
those
far
places
and
large
numbers
of
pure
englishmen
are
not
but
it
is
truest
of
all
to
say
that
neither
england
nor
ireland
so
much
as
crosses
the
mind
of
most
of
them
once
in
six
months
painting
up
large
notices
of
us
grow
making
money
by
farming
with
machinery
together
with
an
occasional
with
and
photographs
of
a
beautiful
murderess
or
divorcÃ©e
fill
up
the
round
of
their
good
and
happy
lives
and
fleet
the
time
carelessly
as
in
the
golden
age
but
putting
aside
all
this
vast
and
distant
democracy
which
is
the
real
of
americans
and
confining
ourselves
to
that
older
culture
on
the
eastern
coast
which
the
critics
probably
had
in
mind
we
shall
find
the
case
more
comforting
but
not
to
be
covered
with
cheap
and
false
comfort
now
it
is
perfectly
true
that
any
englishman
coming
to
this
eastern
coast
as
i
did
finds
himself
not
only
most
warmly
welcomed
as
a
guest
but
most
cordially
complimented
as
an
englishman
men
recall
with
pride
the
branches
of
their
family
that
belong
to
england
or
the
english
counties
where
they
were
rooted
and
there
are
enthusiasms
for
english
literature
and
history
which
are
as
spontaneous
as
patriotism
itself
something
of
this
may
be
put
down
to
a
certain
promptitude
and
flexibility
in
all
american
kindness
which
is
never
sufficiently
stodgy
to
be
called
good
nature
the
englishman
does
sometimes
wonder
whether
if
he
had
been
a
russian
his
hosts
would
not
have
remembered
remote
russian
aunts
and
uncles
and
disinterred
a
muscovite
or
whether
if
he
had
come
from
iceland
they
would
not
have
known
as
much
about
icelandic
sagas
and
been
as
sympathetic
about
the
absence
of
icelandic
snakes
but
with
a
fair
review
of
the
proportions
of
the
case
he
will
dismiss
this
conjecture
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
a
number
of
educated
americans
are
very
warmly
and
sincerely
sympathetic
with
england
what
i
began
to
feel
with
a
certain
creeping
chill
was
that
they
were
only
too
sympathetic
with
england
the
word
sympathetic
has
sometimes
rather
a
double
sense
the
impression
i
received
was
that
all
these
chivalrous
southerners
and
men
mellow
with
bostonian
memories
were
to
england
they
were
on
the
defensive
and
it
was
poor
old
england
that
they
were
defending
their
attitude
implied
that
somebody
or
something
was
leaving
her
undefended
or
finding
her
indefensible
the
burden
of
that
hearty
chorus
was
that
england
was
not
so
black
as
she
was
painted
it
seemed
clear
that
somewhere
or
other
she
was
being
painted
pretty
black
but
there
was
something
else
that
made
me
uncomfortable
it
was
not
only
the
sense
of
being
somewhat
boisterously
forgiven
it
was
also
something
involving
questions
of
power
as
well
as
morality
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
new
sensation
turned
me
hot
and
cold
and
i
felt
something
i
have
never
before
felt
in
a
foreign
land
never
had
my
father
or
my
grandfather
known
that
sensation
never
during
the
great
and
complex
and
perhaps
perilous
expansion
of
our
power
and
commerce
in
the
last
hundred
years
had
an
englishman
heard
exactly
that
note
in
a
human
voice
england
was
being
i
as
an
englishman
was
not
only
being
pardoned
but
pitied
my
country
was
beginning
to
be
an
object
of
compassion
like
poland
or
spain
my
first
emotion
full
of
the
mood
and
movement
of
a
hundred
years
was
one
of
furious
anger
but
the
anger
has
given
place
to
anxiety
and
the
anxiety
is
not
yet
at
an
end
it
is
not
my
business
here
to
expound
my
view
of
english
politics
still
less
of
european
politics
or
the
politics
of
the
world
but
to
put
down
a
few
impressions
of
american
travel
on
many
points
of
european
politics
the
impression
will
be
purely
negative
i
am
sure
that
most
americans
have
no
notion
of
the
position
of
france
or
the
position
of
poland
but
if
english
readers
want
the
truth
i
am
sure
this
is
the
truth
about
their
notion
of
the
position
of
england
they
are
wondering
or
those
who
are
watching
are
wondering
whether
the
term
of
her
success
is
come
and
she
is
going
down
the
dark
road
after
prussia
many
are
sorry
if
this
is
so
some
are
glad
if
it
is
so
but
all
are
seriously
considering
the
probability
of
its
being
so
and
herein
lay
especially
the
horrible
folly
of
our
terrorism
over
the
irish
people
i
have
noted
that
the
newspapers
told
us
that
america
had
been
chilled
in
its
irish
sympathies
by
irish
detachment
during
the
war
it
is
the
painful
truth
that
any
advantage
we
might
have
had
from
this
we
ourselves
immediately
proceeded
to
destroy
ireland
have
put
herself
wrong
with
america
by
her
attitude
about
belgium
if
england
had
not
instantly
proceeded
to
put
herself
more
wrong
by
her
attitude
towards
ireland
it
is
quite
true
that
two
blacks
do
not
make
a
white
but
you
can
not
send
a
black
to
reproach
people
with
tolerating
blackness
and
this
is
quite
as
true
when
one
is
a
black
brunswicker
and
the
other
a
it
is
true
that
since
then
england
has
made
surprisingly
sweeping
concessions
concessions
so
large
as
to
increase
the
amazement
that
the
refusal
should
have
been
so
long
but
unfortunately
the
combination
of
the
two
rather
clinches
the
conception
of
our
decline
if
the
concession
had
come
before
the
terror
it
would
have
looked
like
an
attempt
to
emancipate
and
would
probably
have
succeeded
coming
so
abruptly
after
the
terror
it
looked
only
like
an
attempt
to
tyrannise
and
an
attempt
that
failed
it
was
partly
an
inheritance
from
a
stupid
tradition
which
tried
to
combine
what
it
called
firmness
with
what
it
called
conciliation
as
if
when
we
made
up
our
minds
to
soothe
a
man
with
a
note
we
always
took
care
to
undo
our
own
action
by
giving
him
a
kick
as
well
the
english
politician
has
often
done
that
though
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
of
such
a
fool
except
that
he
has
wasted
a
fiver
but
in
this
case
he
gave
the
kick
first
received
a
kicking
in
return
and
gave
up
the
money
and
it
was
hard
for
the
bystanders
to
say
anything
except
that
he
had
been
badly
beaten
the
combination
and
sequence
of
events
seems
almost
as
if
it
were
arranged
to
suggest
the
dark
and
ominous
parallel
the
first
action
looked
only
too
like
the
invasion
of
belgium
and
the
second
like
the
evacuation
of
belgium
so
that
vast
and
silent
crowd
in
the
west
looked
at
the
british
empire
as
men
look
at
a
great
tower
that
has
begun
to
lean
thus
it
was
that
while
i
found
real
pleasure
i
could
not
find
unrelieved
consolation
in
the
sincere
compliments
paid
to
my
country
by
so
many
cultivated
americans
their
memories
of
homely
corners
of
historic
counties
from
which
their
fathers
came
of
the
cathedral
that
dwarfs
the
town
or
the
inn
at
the
turning
of
the
road
there
was
something
in
their
voices
and
the
look
in
their
eyes
which
from
the
first
disturbed
me
so
i
have
heard
good
englishmen
who
died
afterwards
the
death
of
soldiers
cry
aloud
in
seems
impossible
of
those
jolly
bavarians
or
will
never
believe
it
when
i
think
of
the
time
i
had
at
heidelberg
but
there
are
other
things
besides
the
parallel
of
prussia
or
the
problem
of
ireland
the
american
press
is
much
freer
than
our
own
the
american
public
is
much
more
familiar
with
the
discussion
of
corruption
than
our
own
and
it
is
much
more
conscious
of
the
corruption
of
our
politics
than
we
are
almost
any
man
in
america
may
speak
of
the
marconi
case
many
a
man
in
england
does
not
even
know
what
it
means
many
imagine
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
propriety
of
politicians
speculating
on
the
stock
exchange
so
that
it
means
a
great
deal
to
americans
to
say
that
one
figure
in
that
drama
is
ruling
india
and
another
is
ruling
palestine
and
this
brings
me
to
another
problem
which
is
also
dealt
with
much
more
openly
in
america
than
in
england
i
mention
it
here
only
because
it
is
a
perfect
model
of
the
misunderstandings
in
the
modern
world
if
any
one
asks
for
an
example
of
exactly
how
the
important
part
of
every
story
is
left
out
and
even
the
part
that
is
reported
is
not
understood
he
could
hardly
have
a
stronger
case
than
the
story
of
henry
ford
of
detroit
when
i
was
in
detroit
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
ford
and
it
really
was
a
pleasure
he
is
a
man
quite
capable
of
views
which
i
think
silly
to
the
point
of
insanity
but
he
is
not
the
vulgar
benevolent
boss
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
is
a
millionaire
but
he
can
not
really
be
convicted
of
being
a
philanthropist
he
is
not
a
man
who
merely
wants
to
run
people
it
is
rather
his
views
that
run
him
and
perhaps
run
away
with
him
he
has
a
distinguished
and
sensitive
face
he
really
invented
things
himself
unlike
most
men
who
profit
by
inventions
he
is
something
of
an
artist
and
not
a
little
of
a
fighter
a
man
of
that
type
is
always
capable
of
being
wildly
wrong
especially
in
the
sectarian
atmosphere
of
america
and
ford
has
been
wrong
before
and
may
be
wrong
now
he
is
chiefly
known
in
england
for
a
project
which
i
think
very
preposterous
that
of
the
peace
ship
which
came
to
europe
during
the
war
but
he
is
not
known
in
england
at
all
in
connection
with
a
much
more
important
campaign
which
he
has
conducted
much
more
recently
and
with
much
more
success
a
campaign
against
the
jews
like
one
of
the
campaigns
of
the
continent
now
any
one
who
knows
anything
of
america
knows
exactly
what
the
peace
ship
would
be
like
it
was
a
national
combination
of
imagination
and
ignorance
which
has
at
least
some
of
the
beauty
of
innocence
men
living
in
those
huge
hedgeless
inland
plains
know
nothing
about
frontiers
or
the
tragedy
of
a
fight
for
freedom
they
know
nothing
of
alarum
and
armaments
or
the
peril
of
a
high
civilisation
poised
like
a
precious
statue
within
reach
of
a
mailed
fist
they
are
accustomed
to
a
cosmopolitan
citizenship
in
which
men
of
all
bloods
mingle
and
in
which
men
of
all
creeds
are
counted
equal
their
highest
moral
boast
is
humanitarianism
their
highest
mental
boast
is
enlightenment
in
a
word
they
are
the
very
last
men
in
the
world
who
would
seem
likely
to
pride
themselves
on
a
prejudice
against
the
jews
they
have
no
religion
in
particular
except
a
sincere
sentiment
which
they
would
call
christianity
and
which
specially
forbids
an
attack
on
the
jews
they
have
a
patriotism
which
prides
itself
on
assimilating
all
types
including
the
jews
ford
is
a
pure
product
of
this
pacific
world
as
was
sufficiently
proved
by
his
pacifism
if
a
man
of
that
sort
has
discovered
that
there
is
a
jewish
problem
it
is
because
there
is
a
jewish
problem
it
is
certainly
not
because
there
is
an
prejudice
for
if
there
had
been
any
amount
of
such
racial
and
religious
prejudice
he
would
have
been
about
the
very
last
sort
of
man
to
have
it
his
particular
part
of
the
world
would
have
been
the
very
last
place
to
produce
it
we
may
well
laugh
at
the
peace
ship
and
its
wild
course
and
inevitable
shipwreck
but
remember
that
its
very
wildness
was
an
attempt
to
sail
as
far
as
possible
from
the
castle
of
everything
that
made
him
should
have
prevented
him
from
being
we
may
mock
him
for
being
mad
on
peace
but
we
can
not
say
that
he
was
so
mad
on
peace
that
he
made
war
on
israel
it
happened
that
when
i
was
in
america
i
had
just
published
some
studies
on
palestine
and
i
was
besieged
by
rabbis
lamenting
my
i
pointed
out
that
they
would
have
got
hold
of
the
wrong
word
even
if
they
had
not
got
hold
of
the
wrong
man
as
a
point
of
personal
autobiography
i
do
not
happen
to
be
a
man
who
dislikes
jews
though
i
believe
that
some
men
do
i
have
had
jews
among
my
most
intimate
and
faithful
friends
since
my
boyhood
and
i
hope
to
have
them
till
i
die
but
even
if
i
did
have
a
dislike
of
jews
it
would
be
illogical
to
call
that
dislike
a
prejudice
prejudice
is
a
very
lucid
latin
word
meaning
the
bias
which
a
man
has
before
he
considers
a
case
i
might
be
said
to
be
prejudiced
against
a
hairy
ainu
because
of
his
name
for
i
have
never
been
on
terms
of
such
intimacy
with
him
as
to
correct
my
preconceptions
but
if
after
moving
about
in
the
modern
world
and
meeting
jews
knowing
jews
doing
business
with
jews
and
reading
and
hearing
about
jews
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
did
not
like
jews
my
conclusion
certainly
would
not
be
a
prejudice
it
would
simply
be
an
opinion
and
one
i
should
be
perfectly
entitled
to
hold
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
not
hold
it
no
extravagance
of
hatred
merely
following
on
of
jews
can
properly
be
called
a
prejudice
now
the
point
is
that
this
new
american
springs
from
experience
and
nothing
but
experience
there
is
no
prejudice
for
it
to
spring
from
or
rather
the
prejudice
is
all
the
other
way
all
the
traditions
of
that
democracy
and
very
creditable
traditions
too
are
in
favour
of
toleration
and
a
sort
of
idealistic
indifference
the
sympathies
in
which
these
people
were
reared
were
all
against
and
in
favour
of
rebecca
they
inherited
a
prejudice
against
a
prejudice
of
these
people
of
the
plains
have
found
the
jewish
problem
exactly
as
they
might
have
struck
oil
because
it
is
and
not
even
because
they
were
looking
for
it
their
view
of
the
problem
like
their
use
of
the
oil
is
not
always
satisfactory
and
with
parts
of
it
i
entirely
disagree
but
the
point
is
that
the
thing
which
i
call
a
problem
and
others
call
a
prejudice
has
now
appeared
in
broad
daylight
in
a
new
country
where
there
is
no
priestcraft
no
feudalism
no
ancient
superstition
to
explain
it
it
has
appeared
because
it
a
problem
and
those
are
the
best
friends
of
the
jews
including
many
of
the
jews
themselves
who
are
trying
to
find
a
solution
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
incident
of
henry
ford
of
detroit
and
you
will
hardly
hear
an
intelligible
word
about
it
in
england
the
talk
of
prejudice
against
the
japs
is
not
unlike
the
talk
of
prejudice
against
the
jews
only
in
this
case
our
indifference
has
really
the
excuse
of
ignorance
we
used
to
lecture
the
russians
for
oppressing
the
jews
before
we
heard
the
word
bolshevist
and
began
to
lecture
them
for
being
oppressed
by
the
jews
in
the
same
way
we
have
long
lectured
the
californians
for
oppressing
the
japs
without
allowing
for
the
possibility
of
their
foreseeing
that
the
oppression
may
soon
be
the
other
way
as
in
the
other
case
it
may
be
a
persecution
but
it
is
not
a
prejudice
the
californians
know
more
about
the
japanese
than
we
do
and
our
own
colonists
when
they
are
placed
in
the
same
position
generally
say
the
same
thing
i
will
not
attempt
to
deal
adequately
here
with
the
vast
international
and
diplomatic
problems
which
arise
with
the
name
of
the
new
power
in
the
far
east
it
is
possible
that
japan
having
imitated
european
militarism
may
imitate
european
pacifism
i
can
not
honestly
pretend
to
know
what
the
japanese
mean
by
the
one
any
more
than
by
the
other
but
when
englishmen
especially
english
liberals
like
myself
take
a
superior
and
censorious
attitude
towards
americans
and
especially
californians
i
am
moved
to
make
a
final
remark
when
a
considerable
number
of
englishmen
talk
of
the
grave
contending
claims
of
our
friendship
with
japan
and
our
friendship
with
america
when
they
finally
tend
in
a
sort
of
summing
up
to
dwell
on
the
superior
virtues
of
japan
i
may
be
permitted
to
make
a
single
comment
we
are
perpetually
boring
the
world
and
each
other
with
talk
about
the
bonds
that
bind
us
to
america
we
are
perpetually
crying
aloud
that
england
and
america
are
very
much
alike
especially
england
we
are
always
insisting
that
the
two
are
identical
in
all
the
things
in
which
they
most
obviously
differ
we
are
always
saying
that
both
stand
for
democracy
when
we
should
not
consent
to
stand
their
democracy
for
half
a
day
we
are
always
saying
that
at
least
we
are
all
when
we
are
descended
from
romans
and
normans
and
britons
and
danes
and
they
are
descended
from
irishmen
and
italians
and
slavs
and
germans
we
tell
a
people
whose
very
existence
is
a
revolt
against
the
british
crown
that
they
are
passionately
devoted
to
the
british
constitution
we
tell
a
nation
whose
whole
policy
has
been
isolation
and
independence
that
with
us
she
can
bear
safely
the
white
man
burden
of
universal
empire
we
tell
a
continent
crowded
with
irishmen
to
thank
god
that
the
saxon
can
always
rule
the
celt
we
tell
a
populace
whose
very
virtues
are
lawless
that
together
we
uphold
the
reign
of
law
we
recognise
our
own
character
in
people
who
make
laws
that
neither
they
nor
anybody
else
can
abide
we
congratulate
them
on
clinging
to
all
they
have
cast
away
and
on
imitating
everything
which
they
came
into
existence
to
insult
and
when
we
have
established
all
these
nonsensical
analogies
with
a
nonexistent
nation
we
wait
until
there
is
a
crisis
in
which
we
really
are
at
one
with
america
and
then
we
falter
and
threaten
to
fail
her
in
a
battle
where
we
really
are
of
one
blood
the
blood
of
the
great
white
race
throughout
the
world
when
we
really
have
one
language
the
fundamental
alphabet
of
cadmus
and
the
script
of
rome
when
we
really
do
represent
the
same
reign
of
law
the
common
conscience
of
christendom
and
the
morals
of
men
baptized
when
we
really
have
an
implicit
faith
and
honour
and
type
of
freedom
to
summon
up
our
souls
as
with
trumpets
many
of
us
begin
to
weaken
and
waver
and
wonder
whether
there
is
not
something
very
nice
about
little
yellow
men
whose
heroic
stories
revolve
round
polygamy
and
suicide
and
whose
heroes
wore
two
swords
and
worshipped
the
ancestors
of
the
mikado
in
fact
and
i
went
to
america
with
some
notion
of
not
discussing
prohibition
but
i
soon
found
that
americans
were
only
too
delighted
to
discuss
it
over
the
nuts
and
wine
they
were
even
willing
if
necessary
to
dispense
with
the
nuts
i
am
far
from
sneering
at
this
having
a
general
philosophy
which
need
not
here
be
expounded
but
which
may
be
symbolised
by
saying
that
monkeys
can
enjoy
nuts
but
only
men
can
enjoy
wine
but
if
i
am
to
deal
with
prohibition
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
first
thing
to
be
said
about
it
the
first
thing
to
be
said
about
it
is
that
it
does
not
exist
it
is
to
some
extent
enforced
among
the
poor
at
any
rate
it
was
intended
to
be
enforced
among
the
poor
though
even
among
them
i
fancy
it
is
much
evaded
it
is
certainly
not
enforced
among
the
rich
and
i
doubt
whether
it
was
intended
to
be
i
suspect
that
this
has
always
happened
whenever
this
negative
notion
has
taken
hold
of
some
particular
province
or
tribe
prohibition
never
prohibits
it
never
has
in
history
not
even
in
moslem
history
and
it
never
will
mahomet
at
least
had
the
argument
of
a
climate
and
not
the
interest
of
a
class
but
if
a
test
is
needed
consider
what
part
of
moslem
culture
has
passed
permanently
into
our
own
modern
culture
you
will
find
the
one
moslem
poem
that
has
really
pierced
is
a
moslem
poem
in
praise
of
wine
the
crown
of
all
the
victories
of
the
crescent
is
that
nobody
reads
the
koran
and
everybody
reads
the
rubaiyat
most
of
us
remember
with
satisfaction
an
old
picture
in
representing
a
festive
old
gentleman
in
a
state
of
collapse
on
the
pavement
and
a
philanthropic
old
lady
anxiously
calling
the
attention
of
a
cabman
to
the
calamity
the
old
lady
says
sure
this
poor
gentleman
is
ill
and
the
cabman
replies
with
fervour
i
wish
i
complaint
we
talk
about
unconscious
humour
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
unconscious
seriousness
flippancy
is
a
flower
whose
roots
are
often
underground
in
the
subconsciousness
many
a
man
talks
sense
when
he
thinks
he
is
talking
nonsense
touches
on
a
conflict
of
ideas
as
if
it
were
only
a
contradiction
of
language
or
really
makes
a
parallel
when
he
means
only
to
make
a
pun
some
of
the
jokes
of
the
best
period
are
examples
of
this
and
that
quoted
above
is
a
very
strong
example
of
it
the
cabman
meant
what
he
said
but
he
said
a
great
deal
more
than
he
meant
his
utterance
contained
fine
philosophical
doctrines
and
distinctions
of
which
he
was
not
perhaps
entirely
conscious
the
spirit
of
the
english
language
the
tragedy
and
comedy
of
the
condition
of
the
english
people
spoke
through
him
as
the
god
spoke
through
a
or
brazen
mask
of
oracle
and
the
oracle
is
an
omen
and
in
some
sense
an
omen
of
doom
observe
to
begin
with
the
sobriety
of
the
cabman
note
his
measure
his
moderation
or
to
use
the
yet
truer
term
his
temperance
he
only
wishes
to
have
half
the
old
gentleman
complaint
the
old
gentleman
is
welcome
to
the
other
half
along
with
all
the
other
pomps
and
luxuries
of
his
superior
social
station
there
is
nothing
bolshevist
or
even
communist
about
the
temperance
cabman
he
might
almost
be
called
distributist
in
the
sense
that
he
wishes
to
distribute
the
old
gentleman
complaint
more
equally
between
the
old
gentleman
and
himself
and
of
course
the
social
relations
there
represented
are
very
much
truer
to
life
than
it
is
fashionable
to
suggest
by
the
realism
of
this
picture
punch
made
amends
for
some
more
snobbish
pictures
with
the
opposite
social
moral
it
will
remain
eternally
among
his
real
glories
that
he
exhibited
a
picture
in
which
the
cabman
was
sober
and
the
gentleman
was
drunk
despite
many
ideas
to
the
contrary
it
was
emphatically
a
picture
of
real
life
the
truth
is
subject
to
the
simplest
of
all
possible
tests
if
the
cabman
were
really
and
truly
drunk
he
would
not
be
a
cabman
for
he
could
not
drive
a
cab
if
he
had
the
whole
of
the
old
gentleman
complaint
he
would
be
sitting
happily
on
the
pavement
beside
the
old
gentleman
a
symbol
of
social
equality
found
at
last
and
the
levelling
of
all
classes
of
mankind
i
do
not
say
that
there
has
never
been
such
a
monster
known
as
a
drunken
cabman
i
do
not
say
that
the
driver
may
not
sometimes
have
approximated
imprudently
to
of
the
complaint
instead
of
adhering
to
his
severe
but
wise
conception
of
half
of
it
but
i
do
say
that
most
men
of
the
world
if
they
spoke
sincerely
could
testify
to
more
examples
of
helplessly
drunken
gentlemen
put
inside
cabs
than
of
helplessly
drunken
drivers
on
top
of
them
philanthropists
and
officials
who
never
look
at
people
but
only
at
papers
probably
have
a
mass
of
social
statistics
to
the
contrary
founded
on
the
simple
fact
that
cabmen
can
be
about
their
habits
and
gentlemen
can
not
social
workers
probably
have
the
whole
thing
worked
out
in
sections
and
compartments
showing
how
the
extreme
intoxication
of
cabmen
compares
with
the
parallel
intoxication
of
costermongers
or
measuring
the
drunkenness
of
a
dustman
against
the
drunkenness
of
a
but
there
is
more
practical
experience
embodied
in
the
practical
speech
of
the
english
and
in
the
proverb
that
says
drunk
as
a
lord
now
prohibition
whether
as
a
proposal
in
england
or
a
pretence
in
america
simply
means
that
the
man
who
has
drunk
less
shall
have
no
drink
and
the
man
who
has
drunk
more
shall
have
all
the
drink
it
means
that
the
old
gentleman
shall
be
carried
home
in
the
cab
drunker
than
ever
but
that
in
order
to
make
it
quite
safe
for
him
to
drink
to
excess
the
man
who
drives
him
shall
be
forbidden
to
drink
even
in
moderation
that
is
what
it
means
that
is
all
it
means
that
is
all
it
ever
will
mean
it
tends
to
that
in
moslem
countries
where
the
luxurious
and
advanced
drink
champagne
while
the
poor
and
fanatical
drink
water
it
means
that
in
modern
america
where
the
wealthy
are
all
at
this
moment
sipping
their
cocktails
and
discussing
how
much
harder
labourers
can
be
made
to
work
if
only
they
can
be
kept
from
festivity
this
is
what
it
means
and
all
it
means
and
men
are
divided
about
it
according
to
whether
they
believe
in
a
certain
transcendental
concept
called
expressed
in
a
more
mystical
paradox
as
the
equality
of
men
so
long
as
you
do
not
believe
in
justice
and
so
long
as
you
are
rich
and
really
confident
of
remaining
so
you
can
have
prohibition
and
be
as
drunk
as
you
choose
i
see
that
some
remarks
by
the
rev
campbell
dealing
with
social
conditions
in
america
are
reported
in
the
press
they
include
some
observations
about
sinn
fein
in
which
as
in
most
of
allusions
to
ireland
it
is
not
difficult
to
detect
his
dismal
origin
or
the
acrid
smell
of
the
smoke
of
belfast
but
the
remarks
about
america
are
valuable
in
the
objective
sense
over
and
above
their
philosophy
he
believes
that
prohibition
will
survive
and
be
a
success
nor
does
he
seem
himself
to
regard
the
prospect
with
any
special
disfavour
but
he
frankly
and
freely
testifies
to
the
truth
i
have
asserted
that
prohibition
does
not
prohibit
so
far
as
the
wealthy
are
concerned
he
testifies
to
constantly
seeing
wine
on
the
table
as
will
any
other
grateful
guest
of
the
generous
hospitality
of
america
and
he
implies
humorously
that
he
asked
no
questions
about
the
story
told
him
of
the
old
stocks
in
the
cellars
so
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
facts
and
we
come
back
as
before
to
the
principles
is
campbell
content
with
a
prohibition
which
is
another
name
for
privilege
if
so
he
has
simply
absorbed
along
with
his
new
theology
a
new
morality
which
is
different
from
mine
but
he
does
state
both
sides
of
the
inequality
with
equal
logic
and
clearness
and
in
these
days
of
intellectual
fog
that
alone
is
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
now
my
primary
objection
to
prohibition
is
not
based
on
any
arguments
against
it
but
on
the
one
argument
for
it
i
need
nothing
more
for
its
condemnation
than
the
only
thing
that
is
said
in
its
defence
it
is
said
by
capitalists
all
over
america
and
it
is
very
clearly
and
correctly
reported
by
campbell
himself
the
argument
is
that
employees
work
harder
and
therefore
employers
get
richer
that
this
idea
should
be
taken
calmly
by
itself
as
the
test
of
a
problem
of
liberty
is
in
itself
a
final
testimony
to
the
presence
of
slavery
it
shows
that
people
have
completely
forgotten
that
there
is
any
other
test
except
the
servile
test
employers
are
willing
that
workmen
should
have
exercise
as
it
may
help
them
to
do
more
work
they
are
even
willing
that
workmen
should
have
leisure
for
the
more
intelligent
capitalists
can
see
that
this
also
really
means
that
they
can
do
more
work
but
they
are
not
in
any
way
willing
that
workmen
should
have
fun
for
fun
only
increases
the
happiness
and
not
the
utility
of
the
worker
fun
is
freedom
and
in
that
sense
is
an
end
in
itself
it
concerns
the
man
not
as
a
worker
but
as
a
citizen
or
even
as
a
soul
and
the
soul
in
that
sense
is
an
end
in
itself
that
a
man
shall
have
a
reasonable
amount
of
comedy
and
poetry
and
even
fantasy
in
his
life
is
part
of
his
spiritual
health
which
is
for
the
service
of
god
and
not
merely
for
his
mechanical
health
which
is
now
bound
to
the
service
of
man
the
very
test
adopted
has
all
the
servile
implication
the
test
of
what
we
can
get
out
of
him
instead
of
the
test
of
what
he
can
get
out
of
life
campbell
is
reported
to
have
suggested
doubtless
rather
as
a
conjecture
than
a
prophecy
that
england
may
find
it
necessary
to
become
teetotal
in
order
to
compete
commercially
with
the
efficiency
and
economy
of
teetotal
america
well
in
the
eighteenth
and
early
nineteenth
centuries
there
was
in
america
one
of
the
most
economical
and
efficient
of
all
forms
of
labour
it
did
not
happen
to
be
feasible
for
the
english
to
compete
with
it
by
copying
it
there
were
so
many
humanitarian
prejudices
about
in
those
days
but
economically
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
a
man
should
not
have
prophesied
that
england
would
be
forced
to
adopt
american
slavery
then
as
she
is
urged
to
adopt
american
prohibition
now
perhaps
such
a
prophet
would
have
prophesied
rightly
certainly
it
is
not
impossible
that
universal
slavery
might
have
been
the
vision
of
calhoun
as
universal
prohibition
seems
to
be
the
vision
of
campbell
the
old
england
of
would
have
said
that
such
a
plea
for
slavery
was
monstrous
but
what
would
it
have
said
of
a
plea
for
enforced
nevertheless
the
nobler
servile
state
of
calhoun
collapsed
before
it
could
spread
to
europe
and
there
is
always
the
hope
that
the
same
may
happen
to
the
far
more
materialistic
utopia
of
campbell
and
soft
drinks
abstract
morality
is
very
important
and
it
may
well
clear
the
mind
to
consider
what
would
be
the
effect
of
prohibition
in
america
if
it
were
introduced
there
it
would
of
course
be
a
decisive
departure
from
the
tradition
of
the
declaration
of
independence
those
who
deny
that
are
hardly
serious
enough
to
demand
attention
it
is
enough
to
say
that
they
are
reduced
to
minimising
that
document
in
defence
of
prohibition
exactly
as
the
were
reduced
to
minimising
it
in
defence
of
slavery
they
are
reduced
to
saying
that
the
fathers
of
the
republic
meant
no
more
than
that
they
would
not
be
ruled
by
a
king
and
they
are
obviously
open
to
the
reply
which
lincoln
gave
to
douglas
on
the
slavery
question
that
if
that
great
charter
was
limited
to
certain
events
in
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
hardly
worth
making
such
a
fuss
about
in
the
nineteenth
or
in
the
twentieth
but
they
are
also
open
to
another
reply
which
is
even
more
to
the
point
when
they
pretend
that
jefferson
famous
preamble
only
means
to
say
that
monarchy
is
wrong
they
are
maintaining
that
jefferson
only
meant
to
say
something
that
he
does
not
say
at
all
the
great
preamble
does
not
say
that
all
monarchical
government
must
be
wrong
on
the
contrary
it
rather
implies
that
most
government
is
right
it
speaks
of
human
governments
in
general
as
justified
by
the
necessity
of
defending
certain
personal
rights
i
see
no
reason
whatever
to
suppose
that
it
would
not
include
any
royal
government
that
does
defend
those
rights
still
less
do
i
doubt
what
it
would
say
of
a
republican
government
that
does
destroy
those
rights
but
what
are
those
rights
sophists
can
always
debate
about
their
degree
but
even
sophists
can
not
debate
about
their
direction
nobody
in
his
five
wits
will
deny
that
jeffersonian
democracy
wished
to
give
the
law
a
general
control
in
more
public
things
but
the
citizens
a
more
general
liberty
in
private
things
wherever
we
draw
the
line
liberty
can
only
be
personal
liberty
and
the
most
personal
liberties
must
at
least
be
the
last
liberties
we
lose
but
they
are
the
first
liberties
we
lose
it
is
not
a
question
of
drawing
the
line
in
the
right
place
but
of
beginning
at
the
wrong
end
what
are
the
rights
of
man
if
they
do
not
include
the
normal
right
to
regulate
his
own
health
in
relation
to
the
normal
risks
of
diet
and
daily
life
nobody
can
pretend
that
beer
is
a
poison
as
prussic
acid
is
a
poison
that
all
the
millions
of
civilised
men
who
drank
it
all
fell
down
dead
when
they
had
touched
it
its
use
and
abuse
is
obviously
a
matter
of
judgment
and
there
can
be
no
personal
liberty
if
it
is
not
a
matter
of
private
judgment
it
is
not
in
the
least
a
question
of
drawing
the
line
between
liberty
and
licence
if
this
is
licence
there
is
no
such
thing
as
liberty
it
is
plainly
impossible
to
find
any
right
more
individual
or
intimate
to
say
that
a
man
has
a
right
to
a
vote
but
not
a
right
to
a
voice
about
the
choice
of
his
dinner
is
like
saying
that
he
has
a
right
to
his
hat
but
not
a
right
to
his
head
prohibition
therefore
plainly
violates
the
rights
of
man
if
there
are
any
rights
of
man
what
its
supporters
really
mean
is
that
there
are
none
and
in
suggesting
this
they
have
all
the
advantages
that
every
sceptic
has
when
he
supports
a
negation
that
sort
of
ultimate
scepticism
can
only
be
retorted
upon
itself
and
we
can
point
out
to
them
that
they
can
no
more
prove
the
right
of
the
city
to
be
oppressive
than
we
can
prove
the
right
of
the
citizen
to
be
free
in
the
primary
metaphysics
of
such
a
claim
it
would
surely
be
easier
to
make
it
out
for
a
single
conscious
soul
than
for
an
artificial
social
combination
if
there
are
no
rights
of
men
what
are
the
rights
of
nations
perhaps
a
nation
has
no
claim
to
perhaps
it
has
no
claim
to
good
government
perhaps
it
has
no
claim
to
any
sort
of
government
or
any
sort
of
independence
perhaps
they
will
say
is
not
implied
in
the
declaration
of
independence
but
without
going
deep
into
my
reasons
for
believing
in
natural
rights
or
rather
in
supernatural
rights
and
jefferson
certainly
states
them
as
supernatural
i
am
content
here
to
note
that
a
man
treatment
of
his
own
body
in
relation
to
traditional
and
ordinary
opportunities
for
bodily
excess
is
as
near
to
his
as
social
coercion
can
possibly
go
and
that
when
that
is
gone
there
is
nothing
left
if
coercion
applies
to
that
it
applies
to
everything
and
in
the
future
of
this
controversy
it
obviously
will
apply
to
everything
when
i
was
in
america
people
were
already
applying
it
to
tobacco
i
never
can
see
why
they
should
not
apply
it
to
talking
talking
often
goes
with
tobacco
as
it
goes
with
beer
and
what
is
more
relevant
talking
may
often
lead
both
to
beer
and
tobacco
talking
often
drives
a
man
to
drink
both
negatively
in
the
form
of
nagging
and
positively
in
the
form
of
bad
company
if
the
american
puritan
is
so
anxious
to
be
a
he
should
obviously
put
a
stop
to
the
evil
communications
that
really
corrupt
good
manners
he
should
reintroduce
the
scold
bridle
among
the
other
blue
laws
for
a
land
of
blue
devils
he
should
gag
all
gay
deceivers
and
plausible
cynics
he
should
cut
off
all
flattering
lips
and
the
tongue
that
speaketh
proud
things
nobody
can
doubt
that
of
the
harm
in
the
world
is
done
simply
by
talking
jefferson
and
the
old
democrats
allowed
people
to
talk
not
because
they
were
unaware
of
this
fact
but
because
they
were
fettered
by
this
old
fancy
of
theirs
about
freedom
and
the
rights
of
man
but
since
we
have
already
abandoned
that
doctrine
in
a
final
fashion
i
can
not
see
why
the
new
principle
should
not
be
applied
intelligently
and
in
that
case
it
would
be
applied
to
the
control
of
conversation
the
state
would
provide
us
with
forms
already
filled
up
with
the
subjects
suitable
for
us
to
discuss
at
breakfast
perhaps
allowing
us
a
limited
number
of
epigrams
each
perhaps
we
should
have
to
make
a
formal
application
in
writing
to
be
allowed
to
make
a
joke
that
had
just
occurred
to
us
in
conversation
and
the
committee
would
consider
it
in
due
course
perhaps
it
would
be
effected
in
a
more
practical
fashion
and
the
private
citizens
would
be
shut
up
as
the
were
shut
up
perhaps
they
would
all
wear
gags
which
the
policeman
would
remove
at
stated
hours
and
their
mouths
would
be
opened
from
one
to
three
as
now
in
england
even
the
are
from
time
to
time
accessible
to
the
public
to
some
this
will
sound
fantastic
but
not
so
fantastic
as
jefferson
would
have
thought
prohibition
but
there
is
one
sense
in
which
it
is
indeed
fantastic
for
by
hypothesis
it
leaves
out
the
favouritism
that
is
the
fundamental
of
the
whole
matter
the
only
sense
in
which
we
can
say
that
logic
will
never
go
so
far
as
this
is
that
logic
will
never
go
the
length
of
equality
it
is
perfectly
possible
that
the
same
forces
that
have
forbidden
beer
may
go
on
to
forbid
tobacco
but
they
will
in
a
special
and
limited
sense
forbid
tobacco
but
not
cigars
or
at
any
rate
not
expensive
cigars
in
america
where
large
numbers
of
ordinary
men
smoke
rather
ordinary
cigars
there
would
be
doubtless
a
good
opportunity
of
penalising
a
very
ordinary
pleasure
but
the
havanas
of
the
millionaire
will
be
all
right
so
it
will
be
if
ever
the
puritans
bring
back
the
scold
bridle
and
the
statutory
silence
of
the
populace
it
will
only
be
the
populace
that
is
silent
the
politicians
will
go
on
talking
these
i
believe
to
be
the
broad
facts
of
the
problem
of
prohibition
but
it
would
not
be
fair
to
leave
it
without
mentioning
two
other
causes
which
if
not
defences
are
at
least
excuses
the
first
is
that
prohibition
was
largely
passed
in
a
sort
of
fervour
or
fever
of
which
was
a
part
of
the
passionate
patriotism
of
america
in
the
war
as
i
have
remarked
elsewhere
those
who
have
any
notion
of
what
that
national
unanimity
was
like
will
smile
when
they
see
america
made
a
model
of
mere
international
idealism
prohibition
was
partly
a
sort
of
patriotic
renunciation
for
the
popular
instinct
like
every
poetic
instinct
always
tends
at
great
crises
to
great
gestures
of
renunciation
but
this
very
fact
while
it
makes
the
inhumanity
far
more
human
makes
it
far
less
final
and
convincing
men
can
not
remain
standing
stiffly
in
such
symbolical
attitudes
nor
can
a
permanent
policy
be
founded
on
something
analogous
to
flinging
a
gauntlet
or
uttering
a
we
might
as
well
expect
all
the
yale
students
to
remain
through
life
with
their
mouths
open
exactly
as
they
were
when
they
uttered
the
college
yell
it
would
be
as
reasonable
as
to
expect
them
to
remain
through
life
with
their
mouths
shut
while
the
which
has
been
the
sacrament
of
all
poets
and
lovers
passed
round
among
all
the
youth
of
the
world
this
point
appeared
very
plainly
in
a
discussion
i
had
with
a
very
thoughtful
and
sympathetic
american
critic
a
clergyman
writing
in
an
magazine
he
put
the
sentiment
of
these
healthier
prohibitionists
which
had
so
much
to
do
with
the
passing
of
prohibition
by
asking
not
a
man
who
is
asked
to
give
up
his
blood
for
his
country
be
asked
to
give
up
his
beer
for
his
country
and
this
phrase
clearly
illuminates
all
the
limitations
of
the
case
i
have
never
denied
in
principle
that
it
might
in
some
abnormal
crisis
be
lawful
for
a
government
to
lock
up
the
beer
or
to
lock
up
the
bread
in
that
sense
i
am
quite
prepared
to
treat
the
sacrifice
of
beer
in
the
same
way
as
the
sacrifice
of
blood
but
is
my
american
critic
really
ready
to
treat
the
sacrifice
of
blood
in
the
same
way
as
the
sacrifice
of
beer
is
bloodshed
to
be
as
prolonged
and
protracted
as
prohibition
is
the
normal
noncombatant
to
shed
his
gore
as
often
as
he
misses
his
drink
i
can
imagine
people
submitting
to
a
special
regulation
as
i
can
imagine
them
serving
in
a
particular
war
i
do
indeed
despise
the
political
knavery
that
deliberately
passes
drink
regulations
as
war
measures
and
then
preserves
them
as
peace
measures
but
that
is
not
a
question
of
whether
drink
and
drunkenness
are
wrong
but
of
whether
lying
and
swindling
are
wrong
but
i
never
denied
that
there
might
need
to
be
exceptional
sacrifices
for
exceptional
occasions
and
war
is
in
its
nature
an
exception
only
if
war
is
the
exception
why
should
prohibition
be
the
rule
if
the
surrender
of
beer
is
worthy
to
be
compared
to
the
shedding
of
blood
why
then
blood
ought
to
be
flowing
for
ever
like
a
fountain
in
the
public
squares
of
philadelphia
and
new
york
if
my
critic
wants
to
complete
his
parallel
he
must
draw
up
rather
a
remarkable
programme
for
the
daily
life
of
the
ordinary
citizens
he
must
suppose
that
through
all
their
lives
they
are
paraded
every
day
at
lunch
time
and
prodded
with
bayonets
to
show
that
they
will
shed
their
blood
for
their
country
he
must
suppose
that
every
evening
after
a
light
repast
of
poison
gas
and
shrapnel
they
are
made
to
go
to
sleep
in
a
trench
under
a
permanent
drizzle
of
it
is
surely
obvious
that
if
this
were
the
normal
life
of
the
citizen
the
citizen
would
have
no
normal
life
the
common
sense
of
the
thing
is
that
sacrifices
of
this
sort
are
admirable
but
abnormal
it
is
not
normal
for
the
state
to
be
perpetually
regulating
our
days
with
the
discipline
of
a
fighting
regiment
and
it
is
not
normal
for
the
state
to
be
perpetually
regulating
our
diet
with
the
discipline
of
a
famine
to
say
that
every
citizen
must
be
subject
to
control
in
such
bodily
things
is
like
saying
that
every
christian
ought
to
tear
himself
with
pincers
because
the
christian
martyrs
did
their
duty
in
time
of
persecution
a
man
has
a
right
to
control
his
body
though
in
a
time
of
martyrdom
he
may
give
his
body
to
be
burned
and
a
man
has
a
right
to
control
his
bodily
health
though
in
a
state
of
siege
he
may
give
his
body
to
be
starved
thus
though
the
patriotic
defence
was
a
sincere
defence
it
is
a
defence
that
comes
back
on
the
defenders
like
a
boomerang
for
it
proves
only
that
prohibition
ought
to
be
ephemeral
unless
war
ought
to
be
eternal
the
other
excuse
is
much
less
romantic
and
much
more
realistic
i
have
already
said
enough
of
the
cause
which
is
really
realistic
the
real
power
behind
prohibition
is
simply
the
plutocratic
power
of
the
pushing
employers
who
wish
to
get
the
last
inch
of
work
out
of
their
workmen
but
before
the
progress
of
modern
plutocracy
had
reached
this
stage
there
was
a
predetermining
cause
for
which
there
was
a
much
better
case
the
whole
business
began
with
the
problem
of
black
labour
i
have
not
attempted
in
this
book
to
deal
adequately
with
the
question
of
the
negro
i
have
refrained
for
a
reason
that
may
seem
somewhat
sensational
that
i
do
not
think
i
have
anything
particularly
valuable
to
say
or
suggest
i
do
not
profess
to
understand
this
singularly
dark
and
intricate
matter
and
i
see
no
use
in
men
who
have
no
solution
filling
up
the
gap
with
sentimentalism
the
chief
thing
that
struck
me
about
the
coloured
people
i
saw
was
their
charming
and
astonishing
cheerfulness
my
sense
of
pathos
was
appealed
to
much
more
by
the
red
indians
and
indeed
i
wish
i
had
more
space
here
to
do
justice
to
the
red
indians
they
did
heroic
service
in
the
war
and
more
than
justified
their
glorious
place
in
the
and
nightmares
of
our
boyhood
but
the
negro
problem
certainly
demands
more
study
than
a
could
give
it
and
this
book
is
controversial
enough
about
things
that
i
have
really
considered
without
permitting
it
to
exhibit
me
as
a
who
shoots
at
sight
but
i
believe
that
it
was
always
common
ground
to
people
of
common
sense
that
the
enslavement
and
importation
of
negroes
had
been
the
crime
and
catastrophe
of
american
history
the
only
difference
was
originally
that
one
side
thought
that
the
crime
once
committed
the
only
reparation
was
their
freedom
while
the
other
thought
that
the
crime
once
committed
the
only
safety
was
their
slavery
it
was
only
comparatively
lately
by
a
process
i
shall
have
to
indicate
elsewhere
that
anything
like
a
positive
case
for
slavery
became
possible
now
among
the
many
problems
of
the
presence
of
an
alien
and
at
least
recently
barbaric
figure
among
the
citizens
there
was
a
very
real
problem
of
drink
drink
certainly
has
a
very
exceptionally
destructive
effect
upon
negroes
in
their
native
countries
and
it
was
alleged
to
have
a
peculiarly
demoralising
effect
upon
negroes
in
the
united
states
to
call
up
the
passions
that
are
the
particular
temptation
of
the
race
and
to
lead
to
appalling
outrages
that
are
followed
by
appalling
popular
vengeance
however
this
may
be
many
of
the
states
of
the
american
union
which
first
forbade
liquor
to
citizens
meant
simply
to
forbid
it
to
negroes
but
they
had
not
the
moral
courage
to
deny
that
negroes
are
citizens
about
all
their
political
expedients
necessarily
hung
the
load
that
hangs
so
heavy
on
modern
politics
hypocrisy
the
superior
race
had
to
rule
by
a
sort
of
secret
society
organised
against
the
inferior
the
american
politicians
dared
not
disfranchise
the
negroes
so
they
coerced
everybody
in
theory
and
only
the
negroes
in
practice
the
drinking
of
the
white
men
became
as
much
a
conspiracy
as
the
shooting
by
the
white
horsemen
of
the
klan
and
in
that
connection
it
may
be
remarked
in
passing
that
the
comparison
illustrates
the
idiocy
of
supposing
that
the
moral
sense
of
mankind
will
ever
support
the
prohibition
of
drinking
as
if
it
were
something
like
the
prohibition
of
shooting
shooting
in
america
is
liable
to
take
a
free
form
and
sometimes
a
very
horrible
form
as
when
private
bravos
were
hired
to
kill
workmen
in
the
capitalistic
interests
of
that
pure
patron
of
disarmament
carnegie
but
when
some
of
the
rich
americans
gravely
tell
us
that
their
drinking
can
not
be
interfered
with
because
they
are
only
using
up
their
existing
stocks
of
wine
we
may
well
be
disposed
to
smile
when
i
was
there
at
any
rate
they
were
using
them
up
very
fast
and
with
no
apparent
fears
about
the
supply
but
if
the
klan
had
started
suddenly
shooting
everybody
they
did
like
in
broad
daylight
and
had
blandly
explained
that
they
were
only
using
up
the
stocks
of
their
ammunition
left
over
from
the
civil
war
it
seems
probable
that
there
would
at
least
have
been
a
little
curiosity
about
how
much
they
had
left
there
might
at
least
have
been
occasional
inquiries
about
how
long
it
was
likely
to
go
on
it
is
even
conceivable
that
some
steps
might
have
been
taken
to
stop
it
no
steps
are
taken
to
stop
the
drinking
of
the
rich
chiefly
because
the
rich
now
make
all
the
rules
and
therefore
all
the
exceptions
but
partly
because
nobody
ever
could
feel
the
full
moral
seriousness
of
this
particular
rule
and
the
truth
is
as
i
have
indicated
that
it
was
originally
established
as
an
exception
and
not
as
a
rule
the
emancipated
negro
was
an
exception
in
the
community
and
a
certain
plan
was
rightly
or
wrongly
adopted
to
meet
his
case
a
law
was
made
professedly
for
everybody
and
practically
only
for
him
prohibition
is
only
important
as
marking
the
transition
by
which
the
trick
tried
successfully
on
black
labour
could
be
extended
to
all
labour
we
in
england
have
no
right
to
be
pharisaic
at
the
expense
of
the
americans
in
this
matter
for
we
have
tried
the
same
trick
in
a
hundred
forms
the
true
philosophical
defence
of
the
modern
oppression
of
the
poor
would
be
to
say
frankly
that
we
have
ruled
them
so
badly
that
they
are
unfit
to
rule
themselves
but
no
modern
oligarch
is
enough
of
a
man
to
say
this
for
like
all
virile
cynicism
it
would
have
an
element
of
humility
which
would
not
mix
with
the
necessary
element
of
hypocrisy
so
we
proceed
just
as
the
americans
do
to
make
a
law
for
everybody
and
then
evade
it
for
ourselves
we
have
not
the
honesty
to
say
that
the
rich
may
bet
because
they
can
afford
it
so
we
forbid
any
man
to
bet
in
any
place
and
then
say
that
a
place
is
not
a
place
it
is
exactly
as
if
there
were
an
american
law
allowing
a
negro
to
be
murdered
because
he
is
not
a
man
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
we
have
not
the
honesty
to
drive
the
poor
to
school
because
they
are
ignorant
so
we
pretend
to
drive
everybody
and
then
send
inspectors
to
the
slums
but
not
to
the
smart
streets
we
apply
the
same
ingenuous
principle
and
are
quite
as
undemocratic
as
western
democracy
nevertheless
there
is
an
element
in
the
american
case
which
can
not
be
present
in
ours
and
this
chapter
may
well
conclude
upon
so
important
a
change
america
can
now
say
with
pride
that
she
has
abolished
the
colour
bar
in
this
matter
the
white
labourer
and
the
black
labourer
have
at
last
been
put
upon
an
equal
social
footing
white
labour
is
every
bit
as
much
enslaved
as
black
labour
and
is
actually
enslaved
by
a
method
and
a
model
only
intended
for
black
labour
we
might
think
it
rather
odd
if
the
exact
regulations
about
flogging
negroes
were
reproduced
as
a
plan
for
punishing
strikers
or
if
industrial
arbitration
issued
its
reports
in
the
precise
terminology
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
but
this
is
in
essentials
what
has
happened
and
one
could
almost
fancy
some
negro
orgy
of
triumph
with
the
beating
of
gongs
and
all
the
secret
violence
of
voodoo
crying
aloud
to
some
ancestral
mumbo
jumbo
that
the
poor
white
trash
was
being
treated
according
to
its
name
and
public
a
foreigner
is
a
man
who
laughs
at
everything
except
jokes
he
is
perfectly
entitled
to
laugh
at
anything
so
long
as
he
realises
in
a
reverent
and
religious
spirit
that
he
himself
is
laughable
i
was
a
foreigner
in
america
and
i
can
truly
claim
that
the
sense
of
my
own
laughable
position
never
left
me
but
when
the
native
and
the
foreigner
have
finished
with
seeing
the
fun
of
each
other
in
things
that
are
meant
to
be
serious
they
both
approach
the
far
more
delicate
and
dangerous
ground
of
things
that
are
meant
to
be
funny
the
sense
of
humour
is
generally
very
national
perhaps
that
is
why
the
internationalists
are
so
careful
to
purge
themselves
of
it
i
had
occasion
during
the
war
to
consider
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
certain
differences
alleged
to
have
arisen
between
the
english
and
american
soldiers
at
the
front
and
rightly
or
wrongly
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
arose
from
the
failure
to
understand
when
a
foreigner
is
serious
and
when
he
is
humorous
and
it
is
in
the
very
nature
of
the
best
sort
of
joke
to
be
the
worst
sort
of
insult
if
it
is
not
taken
as
a
joke
the
english
and
the
american
types
of
humour
are
in
one
way
directly
contrary
the
most
american
sort
of
fun
involves
a
soaring
imagination
piling
one
house
on
another
in
a
tower
like
that
of
a
the
most
english
humour
consists
of
a
sort
of
bathos
of
a
man
returning
to
the
earth
his
mother
in
a
homely
fashion
as
when
he
sits
down
suddenly
on
a
english
farce
describes
a
man
as
being
in
a
hole
american
fantasy
in
its
more
aspiring
spirit
describes
a
man
as
being
up
a
tree
the
former
is
to
be
found
in
the
cockney
comic
songs
that
concern
themselves
with
hanging
out
the
washing
or
coming
home
with
the
milk
the
latter
is
to
be
found
in
those
fantastic
yarns
about
machines
that
turn
live
pigs
into
purses
or
burning
cities
that
serve
to
hatch
an
egg
but
it
will
be
inevitable
when
the
two
come
first
into
contact
that
the
bathos
will
sound
like
vulgarity
and
the
extravagance
will
sound
like
boasting
suppose
an
american
soldier
said
to
an
english
soldier
in
the
trenches
kaiser
may
want
a
place
in
the
sun
i
reckon
he
wo
have
a
place
in
the
solar
system
when
we
begin
to
hustle
the
english
soldier
will
very
probably
form
the
impression
that
this
is
arrogance
an
impression
based
on
the
extraordinary
assumption
that
the
american
means
what
he
says
the
american
has
merely
indulged
in
a
little
art
for
art
sake
and
abstract
adventure
of
the
imagination
he
has
told
an
american
short
story
but
the
englishman
not
understanding
this
will
think
the
other
man
is
boasting
and
reflecting
on
the
insufficiency
of
the
english
effort
the
english
soldier
is
very
likely
to
say
something
like
you
be
wanting
to
get
home
to
your
old
woman
before
that
and
asking
for
a
kipper
with
your
tea
and
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
american
will
be
offended
in
his
turn
at
having
his
arabesque
of
abstract
beauty
answered
in
so
personal
a
fashion
being
an
american
he
will
probably
have
a
fine
and
chivalrous
respect
for
his
wife
and
may
object
to
her
being
called
an
old
woman
possibly
he
in
turn
may
be
under
the
extraordinary
delusion
that
talking
of
the
old
woman
really
means
that
the
woman
is
old
possibly
he
thinks
the
mysterious
demand
for
a
kipper
carries
with
it
some
charge
of
his
wife
which
his
national
sense
of
honour
swiftly
resents
but
the
real
come
from
the
contrary
direction
of
the
two
exaggerations
the
american
making
life
more
wild
and
impossible
than
it
is
and
the
englishman
making
it
more
flat
and
farcical
than
it
is
the
one
escaping
from
the
house
of
life
by
a
skylight
and
the
other
by
a
this
difficulty
of
different
humours
is
a
very
practical
one
for
practical
people
most
of
those
who
profess
to
remove
all
international
differences
are
not
practical
people
most
of
the
phrases
offered
for
the
reconciliation
of
severally
patriotic
peoples
are
entirely
serious
and
even
solemn
phrases
but
human
conversation
is
not
conducted
in
those
phrases
the
normal
man
on
nine
occasions
out
of
ten
is
rather
a
flippant
man
and
the
normal
man
is
almost
always
the
national
man
patriotism
is
the
most
popular
of
all
the
virtues
the
drier
sort
of
democrats
who
despise
it
have
the
democracy
against
them
in
every
country
in
the
world
hence
their
international
efforts
seldom
go
any
farther
than
to
effect
an
international
reconciliation
of
all
internationalists
but
we
have
not
solved
the
normal
and
popular
problem
until
we
have
an
international
reconciliation
of
all
nationalists
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
how
humour
can
be
translated
at
all
when
sam
weller
is
in
the
fleet
prison
and
weller
and
stiggins
sit
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
and
weep
and
groan
with
sympathy
old
weller
observes
sammy
i
hope
you
find
your
spirits
rose
by
this
lively
visit
i
have
never
looked
up
this
passage
in
the
popular
and
successful
french
version
of
but
i
confess
i
am
curious
as
to
what
french
conveys
the
precise
effect
of
the
word
a
translator
has
not
only
to
give
the
right
translation
of
the
right
word
but
the
right
translation
of
the
wrong
word
and
in
the
same
way
i
am
quite
prepared
to
suspect
that
there
are
english
jokes
which
an
englishman
must
enjoy
in
his
own
rich
and
romantic
solitude
without
asking
for
the
sympathy
of
an
american
but
englishmen
are
generally
only
too
prone
to
claim
this
fine
perception
without
seeing
that
the
fine
edge
of
it
cuts
both
ways
i
have
begun
this
chapter
on
the
note
of
national
humour
because
i
wish
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
i
realise
how
easily
a
foreigner
may
take
something
seriously
that
is
not
serious
when
i
think
something
in
america
is
really
foolish
it
may
be
i
that
am
made
a
fool
of
it
is
the
first
duty
of
a
traveller
to
allow
for
this
but
it
seems
to
be
the
very
last
thing
that
occurs
to
some
travellers
but
when
i
seek
to
say
something
of
what
may
be
called
the
fantastic
side
of
america
i
allow
beforehand
that
some
of
it
may
be
meant
to
be
fantastic
and
indeed
it
is
very
difficult
to
believe
that
some
of
it
is
meant
to
be
serious
but
whether
or
no
there
is
a
joke
there
is
certainly
an
inconsistency
and
it
is
an
inconsistency
in
the
moral
of
america
which
both
puzzles
and
amuses
me
the
danger
of
democracy
is
not
anarchy
but
convention
there
is
even
a
sort
of
double
meaning
in
the
word
for
it
is
also
used
for
the
most
informal
and
popular
sort
of
parliament
a
parliament
not
summoned
by
any
king
the
americans
come
together
very
easily
without
any
king
but
their
coming
together
is
in
every
sense
a
convention
and
even
a
very
conventional
convention
in
a
democracy
riot
is
rather
the
exception
and
respectability
certainly
the
rule
and
though
a
superficial
should
hesitate
about
all
such
generalisations
and
certainly
should
allow
for
enormous
exceptions
to
them
he
does
receive
a
general
impression
of
unity
verging
on
uniformity
thus
americans
all
dress
well
one
might
almost
say
that
american
women
all
look
well
but
they
do
not
as
compared
with
europeans
look
very
different
they
are
in
the
fashion
too
much
in
the
fashion
even
to
be
conspicuously
fashionable
of
course
there
are
patches
both
bohemian
and
babylonian
of
which
this
is
not
true
but
i
am
talking
of
the
general
tone
of
a
whole
democracy
i
have
said
there
is
more
respectability
than
riot
but
indeed
in
a
deeper
sense
the
same
spirit
is
behind
both
riot
and
respectability
it
is
the
same
social
force
that
makes
it
possible
for
the
respectable
to
boycott
a
man
and
for
the
riotous
to
lynch
him
i
do
not
object
to
it
being
called
herd
instinct
so
long
as
we
realise
that
it
is
a
metaphor
and
not
an
explanation
public
opinion
can
be
a
prairie
fire
it
eats
up
everything
that
opposes
it
and
there
is
the
grandeur
as
well
as
the
grave
disadvantages
of
a
natural
catastrophe
in
that
national
unity
pacifists
who
complained
in
england
of
the
intolerance
of
patriotism
have
no
notion
of
what
patriotism
can
be
like
if
they
had
been
in
america
after
america
had
entered
the
war
they
would
have
seen
something
which
they
have
always
perhaps
subconsciously
dreaded
and
would
then
have
beyond
all
their
worst
dreams
detested
and
the
name
of
it
is
democracy
they
would
have
found
that
there
are
disadvantages
in
birds
of
a
feather
flocking
together
and
that
one
of
them
follows
on
a
too
complacent
display
of
the
white
feather
the
truth
is
that
a
certain
flexible
sympathy
with
eccentrics
of
this
kind
is
rather
one
of
the
advantages
of
an
aristocratic
tradition
the
imprisonment
of
debs
the
american
pacifist
which
really
was
prolonged
and
oppressive
would
probably
have
been
shortened
in
england
where
his
opinions
were
shared
by
aristocrats
like
bertrand
russell
and
ponsonby
a
man
like
lord
hugh
cecil
could
be
moved
to
the
defence
of
conscientious
objectors
partly
by
a
true
instinct
of
chivalry
but
partly
also
by
the
general
feeling
that
a
gentleman
may
very
probably
have
aunts
and
uncles
who
are
quite
as
mad
he
takes
the
matter
personally
in
the
sense
of
being
able
to
imagine
the
psychology
of
the
persons
but
democracy
is
no
respecter
of
persons
it
is
no
respecter
of
them
either
in
the
bad
and
servile
or
in
the
good
and
sympathetic
sense
and
debs
was
nothing
to
democracy
he
was
but
one
of
the
millions
this
is
a
real
problem
or
question
in
the
balance
touching
different
forms
of
government
which
is
of
course
quite
neglected
by
the
idealists
who
merely
repeat
long
words
there
was
during
the
war
a
society
called
the
union
of
democratic
control
which
would
have
been
instantly
destroyed
anywhere
where
democracy
had
any
control
or
where
there
was
any
union
and
in
this
sense
the
united
states
have
most
emphatically
got
a
union
nevertheless
i
think
there
is
something
rather
more
subtle
than
this
simple
popular
solidity
behind
the
assimilation
of
american
citizens
to
each
other
there
is
something
even
in
the
individual
ideals
that
drives
towards
this
social
sympathy
and
it
is
here
that
we
have
to
remember
that
biological
fancies
like
the
herd
instinct
are
only
figures
of
speech
and
can
not
really
cover
anything
human
for
the
americans
are
in
some
ways
a
very
people
to
compare
their
social
enthusiasm
to
a
stampede
of
cattle
is
to
ask
us
to
believe
in
a
bull
writing
a
diary
or
a
cow
looking
in
a
intensely
sensitive
by
their
very
vitality
they
are
certainly
conscious
of
criticism
and
not
merely
of
a
blind
and
brutal
appetite
but
the
peculiar
point
about
them
is
that
it
is
this
very
vividness
in
the
self
that
often
produces
the
similarity
it
may
be
that
when
they
are
unconscious
they
are
like
bulls
and
cows
but
it
is
when
they
are
that
they
are
like
each
other
individualism
is
the
death
of
individuality
it
is
so
if
only
because
it
is
an
many
americans
become
almost
impersonal
in
their
worship
of
personality
where
their
natural
selves
might
differ
their
ideal
selves
tend
to
be
the
same
anybody
can
see
what
i
mean
in
those
strong
photographs
of
american
business
men
that
can
be
seen
in
any
american
magazine
each
may
conceive
himself
to
be
a
solitary
napoleon
brooding
at
helena
but
the
result
is
a
multitude
of
napoleons
brooding
all
over
the
place
each
of
them
must
have
the
eyes
of
a
mesmerist
but
the
most
person
can
not
be
mesmerised
by
more
than
one
millionaire
at
a
time
each
of
the
millionaires
must
thrust
forward
his
jaw
offering
if
i
may
say
so
to
fight
the
world
with
the
same
weapon
as
samson
each
of
them
must
accentuate
the
length
of
his
chin
especially
of
course
by
always
being
completely
it
would
be
obviously
inconsistent
with
personality
to
prefer
to
wear
a
beard
these
are
of
course
fantastic
examples
on
the
fringe
of
american
life
but
they
do
stand
for
a
certain
assimilation
not
through
brute
gregariousness
but
rather
through
isolated
dreaming
and
though
it
is
not
always
carried
so
far
as
this
i
do
think
it
is
carried
too
far
there
is
not
quite
enough
unconsciousness
to
produce
real
individuality
there
is
a
sort
of
worship
of
in
the
abstract
so
that
people
are
actually
thinking
about
how
they
can
will
more
than
about
what
they
want
to
this
i
do
think
a
certain
corrective
could
be
found
in
the
nature
of
english
eccentricity
every
man
in
his
humour
is
most
interesting
when
he
is
unconscious
of
his
humour
or
at
least
when
he
is
in
an
intermediate
stage
between
humour
in
the
old
sense
of
oddity
and
in
the
new
sense
of
irony
much
is
said
in
these
days
against
negative
morality
and
certainly
most
americans
would
show
a
positive
preference
for
positive
morality
the
virtues
they
venerate
collectively
are
very
active
virtues
cheerfulness
and
courage
and
vim
otherwise
zip
also
pep
and
similar
things
but
it
is
sometimes
forgotten
that
negative
morality
is
freer
than
positive
morality
negative
morality
is
a
net
of
a
larger
and
more
open
pattern
of
which
the
lines
or
cords
constrict
at
longer
intervals
a
man
like
johnson
could
grow
in
his
own
way
to
his
own
stature
in
the
net
of
the
ten
commandments
precisely
because
he
was
convinced
there
were
only
ten
of
them
he
was
not
compressed
into
the
mould
of
positive
beauty
like
that
of
the
apollo
belvedere
or
the
american
citizen
this
criticism
is
sometimes
true
even
of
the
american
woman
who
is
certainly
a
much
more
delightful
person
than
the
mesmeric
millionaire
with
his
shaven
jaw
interviewers
in
the
united
states
perpetually
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
american
women
and
i
confessed
a
distaste
for
such
generalisations
which
i
have
not
managed
to
lose
the
americans
who
are
the
most
chivalrous
people
in
the
world
may
perhaps
understand
me
but
i
can
never
help
feeling
that
there
is
something
polygamous
about
talking
of
women
in
the
plural
at
all
something
unworthy
of
any
american
except
a
mormon
nevertheless
i
think
the
exaggeration
i
suggest
does
extend
in
a
less
degree
to
american
women
fascinating
as
they
are
i
think
they
too
tend
too
much
to
this
cult
of
impersonal
personality
it
is
a
description
easy
to
exaggerate
even
by
the
faintest
emphasis
for
all
these
things
are
subtle
and
subject
to
striking
individual
exceptions
to
complain
of
people
for
being
brave
and
bright
and
kind
and
intelligent
may
not
unreasonably
appear
unreasonable
and
yet
there
is
something
in
the
background
that
can
only
be
expressed
by
a
symbol
something
that
is
not
shallowness
but
a
neglect
of
the
subconsciousness
and
the
vaguer
and
slower
impulses
something
that
can
be
missed
amid
all
that
laughter
and
light
under
those
starry
candelabra
of
the
ideals
of
the
happy
virtues
sometimes
it
came
over
me
in
a
wordless
wave
that
i
should
like
to
see
a
sulky
woman
how
she
would
walk
in
beauty
like
the
night
and
reveal
more
silent
spaces
full
of
older
stars
these
things
can
not
be
conveyed
in
their
delicate
proportion
even
in
the
most
detached
description
but
the
same
thing
was
in
the
mind
of
a
old
man
i
met
in
new
york
an
irish
exile
and
a
wonderful
talker
who
stared
up
at
the
tower
of
gilded
galleries
of
the
great
hotel
and
said
with
that
spontaneous
movement
of
style
which
is
hardly
heard
except
from
irish
talkers
i
have
been
in
a
village
in
the
mountains
where
the
people
could
hardly
read
or
write
but
all
the
men
were
like
soldiers
and
all
the
women
had
pride
it
sounds
like
a
poem
about
an
earthly
paradise
to
say
that
in
this
land
the
old
women
can
be
more
beautiful
than
the
young
indeed
i
think
walt
whitman
the
national
poet
has
a
line
somewhere
almost
precisely
to
that
effect
it
sounds
like
a
parody
upon
utopia
and
the
image
of
the
lion
lying
down
with
the
lamb
to
say
it
is
a
place
where
a
man
might
almost
fall
in
love
with
his
but
there
is
nothing
in
which
the
finer
side
of
american
gravity
and
good
feeling
does
more
honourably
exhibit
itself
than
in
a
certain
atmosphere
around
the
older
women
it
is
not
a
cant
phrase
to
say
that
they
grow
old
gracefully
for
they
do
really
grow
old
in
this
the
national
optimism
really
has
in
it
the
national
courage
the
old
women
do
not
dress
like
young
women
they
only
dress
better
there
is
another
side
to
this
feminine
dignity
in
the
old
sometimes
a
little
lost
in
the
young
with
which
i
shall
deal
presently
the
point
for
the
moment
is
that
even
whitman
truly
poetic
vision
of
the
beautiful
old
women
suffers
a
little
from
that
bewildering
multiplicity
and
recurrence
that
is
indeed
the
whole
theme
of
whitman
it
is
like
the
green
eternity
of
leaves
of
grass
when
i
think
of
the
eccentric
spinsters
and
incorrigible
grandmothers
of
my
own
country
i
can
not
imagine
that
any
one
of
them
could
possibly
be
mistaken
for
another
even
at
a
glance
and
in
comparison
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
travelling
in
an
earthly
paradise
of
more
decorative
harmonies
and
i
remember
only
a
vast
cloud
of
grey
and
pink
as
of
the
plumage
of
cherubim
in
an
old
picture
but
on
second
thoughts
i
think
this
may
be
only
the
inevitable
effect
of
visiting
any
country
in
a
swift
and
superficial
fashion
and
that
the
grey
and
pink
cloud
is
probably
an
illusion
like
the
spinning
prairies
scattered
by
the
wheel
of
the
train
anyhow
there
is
enough
of
this
equality
and
of
a
certain
social
unity
favourable
to
sanity
to
make
the
next
point
about
america
very
much
of
a
puzzle
it
seems
to
me
a
very
real
problem
to
which
i
have
never
seen
an
answer
even
such
as
i
shall
attempt
here
why
a
democracy
should
produce
fads
and
why
where
there
is
so
genuine
a
sense
of
human
dignity
there
should
be
so
much
of
an
impossible
petty
tyranny
i
am
not
referring
solely
or
even
specially
to
prohibition
which
i
discuss
elsewhere
prohibition
is
at
least
a
superstition
and
therefore
next
door
to
a
religion
it
has
some
imaginable
connection
with
moral
questions
as
have
slavery
or
human
sacrifice
but
those
who
ask
us
to
model
ourselves
on
the
states
which
punish
the
sin
of
drink
forget
that
there
are
states
which
punish
the
equally
shameless
sin
of
smoking
a
cigarette
in
the
open
air
the
same
american
atmosphere
that
permits
prohibition
permits
of
people
being
punished
for
kissing
each
other
in
other
words
there
are
states
psychologically
capable
of
making
a
man
a
convict
for
wearing
a
blue
or
having
a
green
or
anything
else
that
anybody
chooses
to
fancy
there
is
an
american
atmosphere
in
which
people
may
some
day
be
shot
for
shaking
hands
or
hanged
for
writing
a
as
for
the
sort
of
thing
to
which
i
refer
the
american
newspapers
are
full
of
it
and
there
is
no
name
for
it
but
mere
madness
indeed
it
is
not
only
mad
but
it
calls
itself
mad
to
mention
but
one
example
out
of
many
it
was
actually
boasted
that
some
lunatics
were
teaching
children
to
take
care
of
their
health
and
it
was
proudly
added
that
the
children
were
that
it
is
not
exactly
the
object
of
all
mental
hygiene
to
make
people
mad
did
not
occur
to
them
and
they
may
still
be
engaged
in
their
earnest
labours
to
teach
babies
to
be
valetudinarians
and
hypochondriacs
in
order
to
make
them
healthy
in
such
cases
we
may
say
that
the
modern
world
is
too
ridiculous
to
be
ridiculed
you
can
not
caricature
a
caricature
imagine
what
a
satirist
of
saner
days
would
have
made
of
the
daily
life
of
a
child
of
six
who
was
actually
admitted
to
be
mad
on
the
subject
of
his
own
health
these
are
not
days
in
which
that
great
extravaganza
could
be
written
but
i
dimly
see
some
of
its
episodes
like
uncompleted
dreams
i
see
the
child
pausing
in
the
middle
of
a
or
when
he
has
performed
of
a
and
consulting
a
little
about
the
amount
of
exercise
per
diem
i
see
him
pausing
up
a
tree
or
when
he
has
climbed
exactly
of
a
tree
and
then
producing
a
clinical
thermometer
to
take
his
own
temperature
but
what
would
be
the
good
of
imaginative
logic
to
prove
the
madness
of
such
people
when
they
themselves
praise
it
for
being
mad
there
is
also
the
cult
of
the
infant
phenomenon
of
which
dickens
made
fun
and
of
which
educationalists
make
fusses
when
i
was
in
america
another
newspaper
produced
a
marvellous
child
of
six
who
had
the
intellect
of
a
child
of
twelve
the
only
test
given
and
apparently
one
on
which
the
experiment
turned
was
that
she
could
be
made
to
understand
and
even
to
employ
the
word
when
asked
to
say
something
proving
this
the
happy
infant
offered
the
polished
aphorism
common
sense
comes
in
superstition
is
annihilated
in
reply
to
which
by
way
of
showing
that
i
also
am
as
intelligent
as
a
child
of
twelve
and
there
is
no
arrested
development
about
me
i
will
say
in
the
same
elegant
diction
psychological
education
comes
in
common
sense
is
annihilated
everybody
seems
to
be
sitting
round
this
child
in
an
adoring
fashion
it
did
not
seem
to
occur
to
anybody
that
we
do
not
particularly
want
even
a
child
of
twelve
to
talk
about
annihilating
superstition
that
we
do
not
want
a
child
of
six
to
talk
like
a
child
of
twelve
or
a
child
of
twelve
to
talk
like
a
man
of
fifty
or
even
a
man
of
fifty
to
talk
like
a
fool
and
on
the
principle
of
hoping
that
a
little
girl
of
six
will
have
a
massive
and
mature
brain
there
is
every
reason
for
hoping
that
a
little
boy
of
six
will
grow
a
magnificent
and
bushy
beard
now
there
is
any
amount
of
this
nonsense
cropping
up
among
american
cranks
anybody
may
propose
to
establish
coercive
eugenics
or
enforce
psychoanalysis
that
is
enforce
confession
without
absolution
and
i
confess
i
can
not
connect
this
feature
with
the
genuine
democratic
spirit
of
the
mass
i
can
only
suggest
in
concluding
this
chapter
two
possible
causes
rather
peculiar
to
america
which
may
have
made
this
great
democracy
so
unlike
all
other
democracies
and
in
this
so
manifestly
hostile
to
the
whole
democratic
idea
the
first
historical
cause
is
puritanism
but
not
puritanism
merely
in
the
sense
of
prohibitionism
the
truth
is
that
prohibitions
might
have
done
far
less
harm
as
prohibitions
if
a
vague
association
had
not
arisen
on
some
dark
day
of
human
unreason
between
prohibition
and
progress
and
it
was
the
progress
that
did
the
harm
not
the
prohibition
men
can
enjoy
life
under
considerable
limitations
if
they
can
be
sure
of
their
limited
enjoyments
but
under
progressive
puritanism
we
can
never
be
sure
of
anything
the
curse
of
it
is
not
limitation
it
is
unlimited
limitation
the
evil
is
not
in
the
restriction
but
in
the
fact
that
nothing
can
ever
restrict
the
restriction
the
prohibitions
are
bound
to
progress
point
by
point
more
and
more
human
rights
and
pleasures
must
of
necessity
be
taken
away
for
it
is
of
the
nature
of
this
futurism
that
the
latest
fad
is
the
faith
of
the
future
and
the
most
fantastic
fad
inevitably
makes
the
pace
thus
the
worst
thing
in
the
aberration
was
not
so
much
puritanism
as
sectarianism
it
searched
for
truth
not
by
synthesis
but
by
subdivision
it
not
only
broke
religion
into
small
pieces
but
it
was
bound
to
choose
the
smallest
piece
there
is
in
america
i
believe
a
large
religious
body
that
has
felt
it
right
to
separate
itself
from
christendom
because
it
can
not
believe
in
the
morality
of
wearing
buttons
i
do
not
know
how
the
schism
arose
but
it
is
easy
to
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
had
originally
existed
some
puritan
body
which
condemned
the
frivolity
of
ribbons
though
not
of
buttons
i
was
going
to
say
of
badges
but
not
buttons
but
on
reflection
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
any
american
however
insane
would
object
to
wearing
badges
but
the
point
is
that
as
the
holy
spirit
of
progressive
prophesy
rested
on
the
first
sect
because
it
had
invented
a
new
objection
to
ribbons
so
that
holy
spirit
would
then
pass
from
it
to
the
new
sect
who
invented
a
further
objection
to
buttons
and
from
them
it
must
inevitably
pass
to
any
rebel
among
them
who
shall
choose
to
rise
and
say
that
he
disapproves
of
trousers
because
of
the
existence
of
each
secession
in
turn
must
be
right
because
it
is
recent
and
progress
must
progress
by
growing
smaller
and
smaller
that
is
the
progressive
theory
the
legacy
of
sectarianism
the
dogma
implied
in
much
modern
politics
and
the
evident
enemy
of
democracy
democracy
is
reproached
with
saying
that
the
majority
is
always
right
but
progress
says
that
the
minority
is
always
right
progressives
are
prophets
and
fortunately
not
all
the
people
are
prophets
thus
in
the
atmosphere
of
this
slowly
dying
sectarianism
anybody
who
chooses
to
prophesy
and
prohibit
can
tyrannise
over
the
people
if
he
chooses
to
say
that
drinking
is
always
wrong
or
that
kissing
is
always
wrong
or
that
wearing
buttons
is
always
wrong
people
are
afraid
to
contradict
him
for
fear
they
should
be
contradicting
their
own
for
their
superstition
is
an
inversion
of
the
of
china
and
instead
of
vainly
appealing
to
something
that
is
dead
they
appeal
to
something
that
may
never
be
born
there
is
another
cause
of
this
strange
servile
disease
in
american
democracy
it
is
to
be
found
in
american
feminism
and
feminist
america
is
an
entirely
different
thing
from
feminine
america
i
should
say
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
american
girls
laugh
at
their
female
politicians
at
least
as
much
as
the
majority
of
american
men
despise
their
male
politicians
but
though
the
aggressive
feminists
are
a
minority
they
are
in
this
atmosphere
which
i
have
tried
to
analyse
the
atmosphere
in
which
there
is
a
sort
of
sanctity
about
the
minority
and
it
is
this
superstition
of
seriousness
that
constitutes
the
most
solid
obstacle
and
exception
to
the
general
and
almost
conventional
pressure
of
public
opinion
when
a
fad
is
frankly
felt
to
be
as
was
abolitionism
before
the
civil
war
or
in
the
great
war
or
the
suggestion
of
racial
admixture
in
the
south
at
all
times
then
the
fad
meets
far
less
mercy
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
it
is
snowed
under
and
swept
away
but
when
it
does
not
thus
directly
challenge
patriotism
or
popular
ideas
a
curious
halo
of
hopeful
solemnity
surrounds
it
merely
because
it
is
a
fad
but
above
all
if
it
is
a
feminine
fad
the
earnest
who
really
utters
a
warning
against
the
social
evil
of
beer
or
buttons
is
seen
to
be
walking
clothed
in
light
like
a
prophetess
perhaps
it
is
something
of
the
holy
aureole
which
the
east
sees
shining
around
an
idiot
but
i
think
there
is
another
explanation
feminine
rather
than
feminist
and
proceeding
from
normal
women
and
not
from
abnormal
idiots
it
is
something
that
involves
an
old
controversy
but
one
upon
which
i
have
not
like
so
many
politicians
changed
my
opinion
it
concerns
the
particular
fashion
in
which
women
tend
to
regard
or
rather
to
disregard
the
formal
and
legal
rights
of
the
citizen
in
so
far
as
this
is
a
bias
it
is
a
bias
in
the
directly
opposite
direction
from
that
now
lightly
alleged
there
is
a
sort
of
underbred
history
going
about
according
to
which
women
in
the
past
have
always
been
in
the
position
of
slaves
it
is
much
more
to
the
point
to
note
that
women
have
always
been
in
the
position
of
despots
they
have
been
despotic
because
they
ruled
in
an
area
where
they
had
too
much
common
sense
to
attempt
to
be
constitutional
you
can
not
grant
a
constitution
to
a
nursery
nor
can
babies
assemble
like
barons
and
extort
a
great
charter
tommy
can
not
plead
a
habeas
corpus
against
going
to
bed
and
an
infant
can
not
be
tried
by
twelve
other
infants
before
he
is
put
in
the
corner
and
as
there
can
be
no
laws
or
liberties
in
a
nursery
the
extension
of
feminism
means
that
there
shall
be
no
more
laws
or
liberties
in
a
state
than
there
are
in
a
nursery
the
woman
does
not
really
regard
men
as
citizens
but
as
children
she
may
if
she
is
a
humanitarian
love
all
mankind
but
she
does
not
respect
it
still
less
does
she
respect
its
votes
now
a
man
must
be
very
blind
nowadays
not
to
see
that
there
is
a
danger
of
a
sort
of
amateur
science
or
being
made
the
excuse
for
every
trick
of
tyranny
and
interference
anybody
who
is
not
an
anarchist
agrees
with
having
a
policeman
at
the
corner
of
the
street
but
the
danger
at
present
is
that
of
finding
the
policeman
down
the
chimney
or
even
under
the
bed
in
other
words
it
is
a
danger
of
turning
the
policeman
into
a
sort
of
benevolent
burglar
against
this
protests
are
already
being
made
and
will
increasingly
be
made
if
men
retain
any
instinct
of
independence
or
dignity
at
all
but
to
complain
of
the
woman
interfering
in
the
home
will
always
sound
like
complaining
of
the
oyster
intruding
into
the
to
object
that
she
has
too
much
power
over
education
will
seem
like
objecting
to
a
hen
having
too
much
to
do
with
eggs
she
has
already
been
given
an
almost
irresponsible
power
over
a
limited
region
in
these
things
and
if
that
power
is
made
infinite
it
will
be
even
more
irresponsible
if
she
adds
to
her
own
power
in
the
family
all
these
alien
fads
external
to
the
family
her
power
will
not
only
be
irresponsible
but
insane
she
will
be
something
which
may
well
be
called
a
nightmare
of
the
nursery
a
mad
mother
but
the
point
is
that
she
will
be
mad
about
other
nurseries
as
well
as
her
own
or
possibly
instead
of
her
own
the
results
will
be
interesting
but
at
least
it
is
certain
that
under
this
softening
influence
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the
people
will
most
assuredly
perish
from
the
earth
but
there
is
always
another
possibility
hints
of
it
may
be
noted
here
and
there
like
muffled
gongs
of
doom
the
other
day
some
people
preaching
some
low
trick
or
other
for
running
away
from
the
glory
of
motherhood
were
suddenly
silenced
in
new
york
by
a
voice
of
deep
and
democratic
volume
the
prigs
who
potter
about
the
great
plains
are
pygmies
dancing
round
a
sleeping
giant
that
which
sleeps
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
is
the
huge
power
of
human
unanimity
and
intolerance
in
the
soul
of
america
at
present
the
masses
in
the
middle
west
are
indifferent
to
such
fancies
or
faintly
attracted
by
them
as
fashions
of
culture
from
the
great
cities
but
any
day
it
may
not
be
so
some
lunatic
may
cut
across
their
economic
rights
or
their
strange
and
buried
religion
and
then
he
will
see
something
he
will
find
himself
running
like
a
nigger
who
has
wronged
a
white
woman
or
a
man
who
has
set
the
prairie
on
fire
he
will
see
something
which
the
politicians
fan
in
its
sleep
and
flatter
with
the
name
of
the
people
which
many
reactionaries
have
cursed
with
the
name
of
the
mob
but
which
in
any
case
has
had
under
its
feet
the
crowns
of
many
kings
it
was
said
that
the
voice
of
the
people
is
the
voice
of
god
and
this
at
least
is
certain
that
it
can
be
the
voice
of
god
to
the
wicked
and
the
last
antics
of
their
arrogance
shall
stiffen
before
something
enormous
such
as
towers
in
the
last
words
that
job
heard
out
of
the
whirlwind
and
a
voice
they
never
knew
shall
tell
them
that
his
name
is
leviathan
and
he
is
lord
over
all
the
children
of
pride
extraordinary
when
i
was
in
america
i
had
the
feeling
that
it
was
far
more
foreign
than
france
or
even
than
ireland
and
by
foreign
i
mean
fascinating
rather
than
repulsive
i
mean
that
element
of
strangeness
which
marks
the
frontier
of
any
fairyland
or
gives
to
the
traveller
himself
the
almost
eerie
title
of
the
stranger
and
i
saw
there
more
clearly
than
in
countries
counted
as
more
remote
from
us
in
race
or
religion
a
paradox
that
is
one
of
the
great
truths
of
travel
we
have
never
even
begun
to
understand
a
people
until
we
have
found
something
that
we
do
not
understand
so
long
as
we
find
the
character
easy
to
read
we
are
reading
into
it
our
own
character
if
when
we
see
an
event
we
can
promptly
provide
an
explanation
we
may
be
pretty
certain
that
we
had
ourselves
prepared
the
explanation
before
we
saw
the
event
it
follows
from
this
that
the
best
picture
of
a
foreign
people
can
probably
be
found
in
a
puzzle
picture
if
we
can
find
an
event
of
which
the
meaning
is
really
dark
to
us
it
will
probably
throw
some
light
on
the
truth
i
will
therefore
take
from
my
american
experiences
one
isolated
incident
which
certainly
could
not
have
happened
in
any
other
country
i
have
ever
clapped
eyes
on
i
have
really
no
notion
of
what
it
meant
i
have
heard
even
from
americans
about
five
different
conjectures
about
its
meaning
but
though
i
do
not
understand
it
i
do
sincerely
believe
that
if
i
did
understand
it
i
should
understand
america
it
happened
in
the
city
of
oklahoma
which
would
require
a
book
to
itself
even
considered
as
a
background
the
state
of
oklahoma
is
a
district
in
the
recently
reclaimed
from
the
red
indian
territory
what
many
quite
incorrectly
imagine
about
all
america
is
really
true
of
oklahoma
it
is
proud
of
having
no
history
it
is
glowing
with
the
sense
of
having
a
great
future
and
nothing
else
people
are
just
as
likely
to
boast
of
an
old
building
in
nashville
as
in
norwich
people
are
just
as
proud
of
old
families
in
boston
as
in
bath
but
in
oklahoma
the
citizens
do
point
out
a
colossal
structure
arrogantly
affirming
that
it
was
there
last
week
it
was
against
the
colours
of
this
crude
stage
scenery
as
of
a
pantomime
city
of
pasteboard
that
the
fantastic
figure
appeared
which
still
haunts
me
like
a
walking
note
of
interrogation
i
was
strolling
down
the
main
street
of
the
city
and
looking
in
at
a
vivid
with
the
news
of
crime
when
a
stranger
addressed
me
and
asked
me
quite
politely
but
with
a
curious
air
of
having
authority
to
put
the
question
what
i
was
doing
in
that
city
he
was
a
lean
brown
man
having
rather
the
look
of
a
shabby
tropical
traveller
with
a
grey
moustache
and
a
lively
and
alert
eye
but
the
most
singular
thing
about
him
was
that
the
front
of
his
coat
was
covered
with
a
multitude
of
shining
metallic
emblems
made
in
the
shape
of
stars
and
crescents
i
was
well
accustomed
by
this
time
to
americans
adorning
the
lapels
of
their
coats
with
little
symbols
of
various
societies
it
is
a
part
of
the
american
passion
for
the
ritual
of
comradeship
there
is
nothing
that
an
american
likes
so
much
as
to
have
a
secret
society
and
to
make
no
secret
of
it
but
in
this
case
if
i
may
put
it
so
the
rash
of
symbolism
seemed
to
have
broken
out
all
over
the
man
in
a
fashion
that
indicated
that
the
fever
was
far
advanced
of
this
minor
mystery
however
his
first
few
sentences
offered
a
provisional
explanation
in
answer
to
his
question
touching
my
business
in
oklahoma
i
replied
with
restraint
that
i
was
lecturing
to
which
he
replied
without
restraint
but
rather
with
an
expansive
and
radiant
pride
also
am
lecturing
i
am
lecturing
on
astronomy
so
far
a
certain
wild
rationality
seemed
to
light
up
the
affair
i
knew
it
was
unusual
in
my
own
country
for
the
astronomer
royal
to
walk
down
the
strand
with
his
coat
plastered
all
over
with
the
solar
system
indeed
it
was
unusual
for
any
english
astronomical
lecturer
to
advertise
the
subject
of
his
lectures
in
this
fashion
but
though
it
would
be
unusual
it
would
not
necessarily
be
unreasonable
in
fact
i
think
it
might
add
to
the
colour
and
variety
of
life
if
specialists
did
adopt
this
sort
of
scientific
heraldry
i
should
like
to
be
able
to
recognise
an
entomologist
at
sight
by
the
decorative
spiders
and
cockroaches
crawling
all
over
his
coat
and
waistcoat
i
should
like
to
see
a
conchologist
in
a
simple
costume
of
shells
an
osteopath
i
suppose
would
be
agreeably
painted
so
as
to
resemble
a
skeleton
while
a
botanist
would
enliven
the
street
with
the
appearance
of
a
so
while
i
regarded
the
astronomical
lecturer
in
the
astronomical
coat
as
a
figure
distinguishable
by
a
high
degree
of
differentiation
from
the
artless
astronomers
of
my
island
home
enough
their
simple
loveliness
for
me
i
saw
in
him
nothing
illogical
but
rather
an
imaginative
extreme
of
logic
and
then
came
another
turn
of
the
wheel
of
and
all
the
logic
was
scattered
to
the
wind
expanding
his
starry
bosom
and
standing
astraddle
with
the
air
of
one
who
owned
the
street
the
strange
being
continued
i
am
lecturing
on
astronomy
anthropology
archaeology
palaeontology
embryology
eschatology
and
so
on
in
a
thunderous
roll
of
theoretical
sciences
apparently
beyond
the
scope
of
any
single
university
let
alone
any
single
professor
having
thus
introduced
himself
however
he
got
to
business
he
apologised
with
true
american
courtesy
for
having
questioned
me
at
all
and
excused
it
on
the
ground
of
his
own
exacting
responsibilities
i
imagined
him
to
mean
the
responsibility
of
simultaneously
occupying
the
chairs
of
all
the
faculties
already
mentioned
but
these
apparently
were
trifles
to
him
and
something
far
more
serious
was
clouding
his
brow
feel
it
to
be
my
duty
he
said
acquaint
myself
with
any
stranger
visiting
this
city
and
it
is
an
additional
pleasure
to
welcome
here
a
member
of
the
upper
ten
i
assured
him
earnestly
that
i
knew
nothing
about
the
upper
ten
except
that
i
did
not
belong
to
them
i
felt
not
without
alarm
that
the
upper
ten
might
be
another
secret
society
he
waved
my
abnegation
aside
and
continued
have
a
great
responsibility
in
watching
over
this
city
my
friend
the
mayor
and
i
have
a
great
responsibility
and
then
an
extraordinary
thing
happened
suddenly
diving
his
hand
into
his
he
flashed
something
before
my
eyes
like
a
something
which
disappeared
again
almost
as
soon
as
it
appeared
in
that
flash
i
could
only
see
that
it
was
some
sort
of
polished
metal
plate
with
some
letters
engraved
on
it
like
a
monogram
but
the
reward
of
a
studious
and
virtuous
life
which
has
been
spent
chiefly
in
the
reading
of
american
detective
stories
shone
forth
for
me
in
that
hour
of
trial
i
received
at
last
the
prize
of
a
profound
scholarship
in
the
matter
of
imaginary
murders
in
magazines
i
remembered
who
it
was
who
in
the
yankee
detective
yarn
flashes
before
the
eyes
of
slim
jim
or
the
lone
hand
crook
a
badge
of
metal
sometimes
called
a
shield
assuming
all
the
desperate
composure
of
slim
jim
himself
i
replied
mean
you
are
connected
with
the
police
authorities
here
do
you
well
if
i
commit
a
murder
here
i
let
you
know
whereupon
that
astonishing
man
waved
a
hand
in
deprecation
bowed
in
farewell
with
the
grace
of
a
dancing
master
and
said
those
are
not
things
we
expect
from
members
of
the
upper
ten
then
that
moving
constellation
moved
away
disappearing
in
the
dark
tides
of
humanity
as
the
vision
passed
away
down
the
dark
tides
from
sir
galahad
and
starlike
mingled
with
the
stars
that
is
the
problem
i
would
put
to
all
americans
and
to
all
who
claim
to
understand
america
who
and
what
was
that
man
was
he
an
astronomer
was
he
a
detective
was
he
a
wandering
lunatic
if
he
was
a
lunatic
who
thought
he
was
an
astronomer
why
did
he
have
a
badge
to
prove
he
was
a
detective
if
he
was
a
detective
pretending
to
be
an
astronomer
why
did
he
tell
a
total
stranger
that
he
was
a
detective
two
minutes
after
saying
he
was
an
astronomer
if
he
wished
to
watch
over
the
city
in
a
quiet
and
unobtrusive
fashion
why
did
he
blazon
himself
all
over
with
all
the
stars
of
the
sky
and
profess
to
give
public
lectures
on
all
the
subjects
of
the
world
every
wise
and
student
of
murder
stories
is
acquainted
with
the
notion
of
a
policeman
in
plain
clothes
but
nobody
could
possibly
say
that
this
gentleman
was
in
plain
clothes
why
not
wear
his
uniform
if
he
was
resolved
to
show
every
stranger
in
the
street
his
badge
perhaps
after
all
he
had
no
uniform
for
these
lands
were
but
recently
a
wild
frontier
rudely
ruled
by
vigilance
committees
some
americans
suggested
to
me
that
he
was
the
sheriff
the
regular
sheriff
of
bret
harte
and
my
boyhood
dreams
others
suggested
that
he
was
an
agent
of
the
klan
that
great
nameless
revolution
of
the
revival
of
which
there
were
rumours
at
the
time
and
that
the
symbol
he
exhibited
was
theirs
but
whether
he
was
a
sheriff
acting
for
the
law
or
a
conspirator
against
the
law
or
a
lunatic
entirely
outside
the
law
i
agree
with
the
former
conjectures
upon
one
point
i
am
perfectly
certain
he
had
something
else
in
his
pocket
besides
a
badge
and
i
am
perfectly
certain
that
under
certain
circumstances
he
would
have
handled
it
instantly
and
shot
me
dead
between
the
gay
bookstall
and
the
crowded
trams
and
that
is
the
last
touch
to
the
complexity
for
though
in
that
country
it
often
seems
that
the
law
is
made
by
a
lunatic
you
never
know
when
the
lunatic
may
not
shoot
you
for
keeping
it
only
in
the
presence
of
that
citizen
of
oklahoma
i
feel
i
am
confronted
with
the
fullness
and
depth
of
the
mystery
of
america
because
i
understand
nothing
i
recognise
the
thing
that
we
call
a
nation
and
i
salute
the
flag
but
even
in
connection
with
this
mysterious
figure
there
is
a
moral
which
affords
another
reason
for
mentioning
him
whether
he
was
a
sheriff
or
an
outlaw
there
was
certainly
something
about
him
that
suggested
the
adventurous
violence
of
the
old
border
life
of
america
and
whether
he
was
connected
with
the
police
or
no
there
was
certainly
violence
enough
in
his
environment
to
satisfy
the
most
ardent
policeman
the
posters
in
the
were
placarded
with
the
verdict
in
the
hamon
trial
a
which
reached
its
crisis
in
oklahoma
while
i
was
there
senator
hamon
had
been
shot
by
a
girl
whom
he
had
wronged
and
his
widow
demanded
justice
or
what
might
fairly
be
called
vengeance
there
was
very
great
excitement
culminating
in
the
acquittal
nor
did
the
hamon
case
appear
to
be
entirely
exceptional
in
that
breezy
borderland
the
moment
the
town
had
received
the
news
that
clara
smith
was
free
newsboys
rushed
down
the
street
shouting
stabbing
outrage
near
oklahoma
or
throat
cut
on
main
street
or
otherwise
resuming
their
regular
mode
of
life
it
seemed
as
much
as
to
say
not
imagine
that
our
local
energies
are
exhausted
in
shooting
a
senator
or
now
the
world
is
young
even
if
clara
smith
is
acquitted
and
the
enthusiasm
of
oklahoma
is
not
yet
cold
but
my
particular
reason
for
mentioning
the
matter
is
this
despite
my
friend
mystical
remarks
about
the
upper
ten
he
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
something
that
was
at
least
the
very
reverse
of
a
respect
for
persons
indeed
there
was
something
in
the
very
crudity
of
his
social
compliment
that
smacked
strangely
enough
of
that
egalitarian
soil
in
a
vaguely
aristocratic
country
like
england
people
would
never
dream
of
telling
a
total
stranger
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
upper
ten
for
one
thing
they
would
be
afraid
that
he
might
be
real
snobbishness
is
never
vulgar
for
it
is
intended
to
please
the
refined
nobody
licks
the
boots
of
a
duke
if
only
because
the
duke
does
not
like
his
boots
cleaned
in
that
way
nobody
embraces
the
knees
of
a
marquis
because
it
would
embarrass
that
nobleman
and
nobody
tells
him
he
is
a
member
of
the
upper
ten
because
everybody
is
expected
to
know
it
but
there
is
a
much
more
subtle
kind
of
snobbishness
pervading
the
atmosphere
of
any
society
trial
in
england
and
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
was
the
total
absence
of
that
atmosphere
in
the
trial
at
oklahoma
hamon
was
presumably
a
member
of
the
upper
ten
if
there
is
such
a
thing
he
was
a
member
of
the
senate
or
upper
house
in
the
american
parliament
he
was
a
millionaire
and
a
pillar
of
the
republican
party
which
might
be
called
the
respectable
party
he
is
said
to
have
been
mentioned
as
a
possible
president
and
the
speeches
of
clara
smith
counsel
who
was
known
by
the
delightfully
oklahomite
title
of
wild
bill
mclean
were
wild
enough
in
all
conscience
but
they
left
very
little
of
my
friend
illusion
that
members
of
the
upper
ten
could
not
be
accused
of
crimes
nero
and
borgia
were
quite
presentable
people
compared
with
senator
hamon
when
wild
bill
mclean
had
done
with
him
but
the
difference
was
deeper
and
even
in
a
sense
more
delicate
than
this
there
is
a
certain
tone
about
english
trials
which
does
at
least
begin
with
a
certain
scepticism
about
people
prominent
in
public
life
being
abominable
in
private
life
people
do
vaguely
doubt
the
criminality
of
man
in
that
position
that
is
the
position
of
the
marquise
de
brinvilliers
or
the
marquis
de
sade
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
the
marquis
de
sade
that
he
was
a
marquis
but
it
was
certainly
against
hamon
that
he
was
a
millionaire
wild
bill
did
not
minimise
him
as
a
bankrupt
or
an
adventurer
he
insisted
on
the
solidity
and
size
of
his
fortune
he
made
mountains
out
of
the
millions
as
if
they
made
the
matter
much
worse
as
indeed
i
think
they
do
but
that
is
because
i
happen
to
share
a
certain
political
philosophy
with
wild
bill
and
other
wild
buffaloes
of
the
prairies
in
other
words
there
is
really
present
here
a
democratic
instinct
against
the
domination
of
wealth
it
does
not
prevent
wealth
from
dominating
but
it
does
prevent
the
domination
from
being
regarded
with
any
affection
or
loyalty
despite
the
man
in
the
starry
coat
the
americans
have
not
really
any
illusions
about
the
upper
ten
mclean
was
appealing
to
an
implicit
public
opinion
when
he
pelted
the
senator
with
his
gold
but
something
more
is
involved
i
became
conscious
as
i
have
been
conscious
in
reading
the
crime
novels
of
america
that
the
millionaire
was
taken
as
a
type
and
not
an
individual
this
is
the
great
difference
that
america
recognises
rich
crooks
as
a
any
englishman
might
recognise
them
as
individuals
any
english
romance
may
turn
on
a
crime
in
high
life
in
which
the
baronet
is
found
to
have
poisoned
his
wife
or
the
elusive
burglar
turns
out
to
be
the
bishop
but
the
english
are
not
always
saying
either
in
romance
or
reality
to
be
done
if
our
food
is
being
poisoned
by
all
these
baronets
they
do
not
murmur
in
indignation
bishops
will
go
on
burgling
like
this
something
must
be
done
the
whole
point
of
the
english
romance
is
the
exceptional
character
of
a
crime
in
high
life
that
is
not
the
tone
of
american
novels
or
american
newspapers
or
american
trials
like
the
trial
in
oklahoma
americans
may
be
excited
when
a
millionaire
crook
is
caught
as
when
any
other
crook
is
caught
but
it
is
at
his
being
caught
not
at
his
being
discovered
to
put
the
matter
shortly
england
recognises
a
criminal
class
at
the
bottom
of
the
social
scale
america
also
recognises
a
criminal
class
at
the
top
of
the
social
scale
in
both
for
various
reasons
it
may
be
difficult
for
the
criminals
to
be
convicted
but
in
america
the
upper
class
of
criminals
is
recognised
in
both
america
and
england
of
course
it
exists
this
is
an
assumption
at
the
back
of
the
american
mind
which
makes
a
great
difference
in
many
ways
and
in
my
opinion
a
difference
for
the
better
i
wrote
merely
fancifully
just
now
about
bishops
being
burglars
but
there
is
a
story
in
new
york
illustrating
this
which
really
does
in
a
sense
attribute
a
burglary
to
a
bishop
the
story
was
that
an
anglican
lord
spiritual
of
the
pompous
and
now
rather
antiquated
school
was
pushing
open
the
door
of
a
poor
american
tenement
with
all
the
placid
patronage
of
the
squire
and
rector
visiting
the
cottagers
when
a
gigantic
irish
policeman
came
round
the
corner
and
hit
him
a
crack
over
the
head
with
a
truncheon
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
a
i
hope
that
those
who
laugh
at
the
story
see
that
the
laugh
is
not
altogether
against
the
policeman
and
that
it
is
not
only
the
policeman
but
rather
the
bishop
who
had
failed
to
recognise
some
fine
logical
distinctions
the
bishop
being
a
learned
man
might
well
be
called
upon
when
he
had
sufficiently
recovered
from
the
knock
on
the
head
to
define
what
is
the
exact
difference
between
a
and
a
and
why
the
should
not
be
regarded
as
a
when
he
will
not
behave
as
a
guest
an
impartial
intelligence
will
be
much
less
shocked
at
the
policeman
disrespect
for
the
than
by
the
disrespect
for
the
home
but
that
story
smacks
of
the
western
soil
precisely
because
of
the
element
of
brutality
there
is
in
it
in
england
snobbishness
and
social
oppression
are
much
subtler
and
softer
the
manifestations
of
them
at
least
are
more
mellow
and
humane
in
comparison
there
is
indeed
something
which
people
call
ruthless
about
the
air
of
america
especially
the
american
cities
the
bishop
may
push
open
the
door
without
an
apology
but
he
would
not
break
open
the
door
with
a
truncheon
but
the
irish
policeman
truncheon
hits
both
ways
it
may
be
brutal
to
the
tenement
dweller
as
well
as
to
the
bishop
but
the
difference
and
distinction
is
that
it
might
really
be
brutal
to
the
bishop
it
is
because
there
is
after
all
at
the
back
of
all
that
barbarism
a
sort
of
a
negative
belief
in
the
brotherhood
of
men
a
dark
democratic
sense
that
men
are
really
men
and
nothing
more
that
the
coarse
and
even
corrupt
bureaucracy
is
not
resented
exactly
as
oligarchic
bureaucracies
are
resented
there
is
a
sense
in
which
corruption
is
not
so
narrow
as
nepotism
it
is
upon
this
queer
cynical
charity
and
even
humility
that
it
has
been
possible
to
rear
so
high
and
uphold
so
long
that
tower
of
brass
tammany
hall
the
modern
police
system
is
in
spirit
the
most
inhuman
in
history
and
its
evil
belongs
to
an
age
and
not
to
a
nation
but
some
american
police
methods
are
evil
past
all
parallel
and
the
detective
can
be
more
crooked
than
a
hundred
crooks
but
in
the
states
it
is
not
only
possible
that
the
policeman
is
worse
than
the
convict
it
is
by
no
means
certain
that
he
thinks
that
he
is
any
better
in
the
popular
stories
of
henry
there
are
light
allusions
to
tramps
being
kicked
out
of
hotels
which
will
make
any
christian
seek
relief
in
strong
language
and
a
trust
in
heaven
not
to
say
in
hell
and
yet
books
even
more
popular
than
henry
are
those
of
the
who
swim
in
lachrymose
lakes
after
spinsters
who
pass
their
lives
in
reclaiming
and
consoling
such
tramps
there
are
in
this
people
two
strains
of
brutality
and
sentimentalism
which
i
do
not
understand
especially
where
they
mingle
but
i
am
fairly
sure
they
both
work
back
to
the
dim
democratic
origin
the
irish
policeman
does
not
confine
himself
fastidiously
to
bludgeoning
bishops
his
truncheon
finds
plenty
of
poor
people
heads
to
hit
and
yet
i
believe
on
my
soul
he
has
a
sort
of
sympathy
with
poor
people
not
to
be
found
in
the
police
of
more
aristocratic
states
i
believe
he
also
reads
and
weeps
over
the
stories
of
the
spinsters
and
the
reclaimed
tramps
in
fact
there
is
much
of
such
pathos
in
an
american
magazine
my
sole
companion
on
many
happy
railway
journeys
which
is
not
only
devoted
to
detective
stories
but
apparently
edited
by
detectives
in
these
stories
also
there
is
the
honest
popular
astonishment
at
the
upper
ten
expressed
by
the
astronomical
detective
if
indeed
he
was
a
detective
and
not
a
demon
from
the
dark
forests
that
faded
to
the
horizon
behind
him
but
i
have
set
him
as
the
head
and
text
of
this
chapter
because
with
these
elements
of
the
third
degree
of
devilry
and
the
seventh
heaven
of
sentimentalism
i
touch
on
elements
that
i
do
not
understand
and
when
i
do
not
understand
i
say
so
republican
in
the
the
heathen
in
his
blindness
bows
down
to
wood
and
stone
especially
to
a
or
a
lithographic
stone
modern
people
put
their
trust
in
pictures
especially
scientific
pictures
as
much
as
the
most
superstitious
ever
put
it
in
religious
pictures
they
publish
a
portrait
of
the
missing
link
as
if
he
were
the
missing
man
for
whom
the
police
are
always
advertising
for
all
the
world
as
if
the
anthropoid
had
been
photographed
before
he
absconded
the
scientific
diagram
may
be
a
hypothesis
it
may
be
a
fancy
it
may
be
a
forgery
but
it
is
always
an
idol
in
the
true
sense
of
an
image
and
an
image
in
the
true
sense
of
a
thing
mastering
the
imagination
and
not
the
reason
the
power
of
these
talismanic
pictures
is
almost
hypnotic
to
modern
humanity
we
can
never
forget
that
we
have
seen
a
portrait
of
the
missing
link
though
we
should
instantly
detect
the
lapse
of
logic
into
superstition
if
we
were
told
that
the
old
greek
agnostics
had
made
a
statue
of
the
unknown
god
but
there
is
a
still
stranger
fashion
in
which
we
fall
victims
to
the
same
trick
of
fancy
we
accept
in
a
blind
and
literal
spirit
not
only
images
of
speculation
but
even
figures
of
speech
the
nineteenth
century
prided
itself
on
having
lost
its
faith
in
myths
and
proceeded
to
put
all
its
faith
in
metaphors
it
dismissed
the
old
doctrines
about
the
way
of
life
and
the
light
of
the
world
and
then
it
proceeded
to
talk
as
if
the
light
of
truth
were
really
and
literally
a
light
that
could
be
absorbed
by
merely
opening
our
eyes
or
as
if
the
path
of
progress
were
really
and
truly
a
path
to
be
found
by
merely
following
our
noses
thus
the
purpose
of
god
is
an
idea
true
or
false
but
the
purpose
of
nature
is
merely
a
metaphor
for
obviously
if
there
is
no
god
there
is
no
purpose
yet
while
men
by
an
imaginative
instinct
spoke
of
the
purpose
of
god
with
a
grand
agnosticism
as
something
too
large
to
be
seen
something
reaching
out
to
worlds
and
to
eternities
they
speak
of
the
purpose
of
nature
in
particular
and
practical
problems
of
curing
babies
or
cutting
up
rabbits
this
power
of
the
modern
metaphor
must
be
understood
by
way
of
an
introduction
if
we
are
to
understand
one
of
the
chief
errors
at
once
evasive
and
pervasive
which
perplex
the
problem
of
america
america
is
always
spoken
of
as
a
young
nation
and
whether
or
no
this
be
a
valuable
and
suggestive
metaphor
very
few
people
notice
that
it
is
a
metaphor
at
all
if
somebody
said
that
a
certain
deserving
charity
had
just
gone
into
trousers
we
should
recognise
that
it
was
a
figure
of
speech
and
perhaps
a
rather
surprising
figure
of
speech
if
somebody
said
that
a
daily
paper
had
recently
put
its
hair
up
we
should
know
it
could
only
be
a
metaphor
and
possibly
a
rather
strained
metaphor
yet
these
phrases
would
mean
the
only
thing
that
can
possibly
be
meant
by
calling
a
corporate
association
of
all
sorts
of
people
that
is
that
a
certain
institution
has
only
existed
for
a
certain
time
i
am
not
now
denying
that
such
a
corporate
nationality
may
happen
to
have
a
psychology
comparatively
analogous
to
the
psychology
of
youth
i
am
not
even
denying
that
america
has
it
i
am
only
pointing
out
to
begin
with
that
we
must
free
ourselves
from
the
talismanic
tyranny
of
a
metaphor
which
we
do
not
recognise
as
a
metaphor
men
realised
that
the
old
mystical
doctrines
were
mystical
they
do
not
realise
that
the
new
metaphors
are
metaphorical
they
have
some
sort
of
hazy
notion
that
american
society
must
be
growing
must
be
promising
must
have
the
virtues
of
hope
or
the
faults
of
ignorance
merely
it
has
only
had
a
separate
existence
since
the
eighteenth
century
and
that
is
exactly
like
saying
that
a
new
chapel
must
be
growing
taller
or
that
a
limited
liability
company
will
soon
have
its
second
teeth
now
in
truth
this
particular
conception
of
american
hopefulness
would
be
anything
but
hopeful
for
america
if
the
argument
really
were
as
it
is
still
vaguely
supposed
to
be
that
america
must
have
a
long
life
before
it
because
it
only
started
in
the
eighteenth
century
we
should
find
a
very
fatal
answer
by
looking
at
the
other
political
systems
that
did
start
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
eighteenth
century
was
called
the
age
of
reason
and
there
is
a
very
real
sense
in
which
the
other
systems
were
indeed
started
in
a
spirit
of
reason
but
starting
from
reason
has
not
saved
them
from
ruin
if
we
survey
the
europe
of
with
real
clarity
and
historic
comprehension
we
shall
see
that
it
is
precisely
the
most
recent
and
the
most
rationalistic
creations
that
have
been
ruined
the
two
great
states
which
did
most
definitely
and
emphatically
deserve
to
be
called
modern
states
were
prussia
and
russia
there
was
no
real
prussia
before
frederick
the
great
no
real
russian
empire
before
peter
the
great
both
those
innovators
recognised
themselves
as
rationalists
bringing
a
new
reason
and
order
into
an
indeterminate
barbarism
and
doing
for
the
barbarians
what
the
barbarians
could
not
do
for
themselves
they
did
not
like
the
kings
of
england
or
france
or
spain
or
scotland
inherit
a
sceptre
that
was
the
symbol
of
a
historic
and
patriotic
people
in
this
sense
there
was
no
russia
but
only
an
emperor
of
russia
in
this
sense
prussia
was
a
kingdom
before
it
was
a
nation
if
it
ever
was
a
nation
but
anyhow
both
men
were
particularly
modern
in
their
whole
mood
and
mind
they
were
modern
to
the
extent
of
being
not
only
but
almost
peter
forced
the
science
of
the
west
on
russia
to
the
regret
of
many
russians
frederick
talked
the
french
of
voltaire
and
not
the
german
of
luther
the
two
experiments
were
entirely
in
the
spirit
of
voltairean
rationalism
they
were
built
in
broad
daylight
by
men
who
believed
in
nothing
but
the
light
of
common
day
and
already
their
day
is
done
if
then
the
promise
of
america
were
in
the
fact
that
she
is
one
of
the
latest
births
of
progress
we
should
point
out
that
it
is
exactly
the
latest
born
that
were
the
first
to
die
if
in
this
sense
she
is
praised
as
young
it
may
be
answered
that
the
young
have
died
young
and
have
not
lived
to
be
old
and
if
this
be
confused
with
the
argument
that
she
came
in
an
age
of
clarity
and
scepticism
uncontaminated
by
old
superstitions
it
could
still
be
retorted
that
the
works
of
superstition
have
survived
the
works
of
scepticism
but
the
truth
is
of
course
that
the
real
quality
of
america
is
much
more
subtle
and
complex
than
this
and
is
mixed
not
only
of
good
and
bad
and
rational
and
mystical
but
also
of
old
and
new
that
is
what
makes
the
task
of
tracing
the
true
proportions
of
american
life
so
interesting
and
so
impossible
to
begin
with
such
a
metaphor
is
always
as
distracting
as
a
mixed
metaphor
it
is
a
tool
that
cuts
both
ways
and
consequently
opposite
ways
we
use
the
same
word
to
mean
two
opposite
extremes
we
mean
something
at
an
early
stage
of
growth
and
also
something
having
the
latest
fruits
of
growth
we
might
call
a
commonwealth
young
if
it
conducted
all
its
daily
conversation
by
wireless
telegraphy
meaning
that
it
was
progressive
but
we
might
also
call
it
young
if
it
conducted
all
its
industry
with
chipped
flints
meaning
that
it
was
primitive
these
two
meanings
of
youth
are
hopelessly
mixed
up
when
the
word
is
applied
to
america
but
what
is
more
curious
the
two
elements
really
are
wildly
entangled
in
america
america
is
in
some
ways
what
is
called
in
advance
of
the
times
and
in
some
ways
what
is
called
behind
the
times
but
it
seems
a
little
confusing
to
convey
both
notions
by
the
same
word
on
the
one
hand
americans
often
are
successful
in
the
last
inventions
and
for
that
very
reason
they
are
often
neglectful
of
the
last
but
one
it
is
true
of
men
in
general
dealing
with
things
in
general
that
while
they
are
progressing
in
one
thing
such
as
science
they
are
going
back
in
another
thing
such
as
art
what
is
less
fully
realised
is
that
this
is
true
even
as
between
different
methods
of
science
the
perfection
of
wireless
telegraphy
might
well
be
followed
by
the
gross
imperfection
of
wires
the
very
enthusiasm
of
american
science
brings
this
out
very
vividly
the
telephone
in
new
york
works
miracles
all
day
long
replies
from
remote
places
come
as
promptly
as
in
a
private
talk
nobody
cuts
anybody
off
nobody
says
you
been
troubled
but
then
the
postal
service
of
new
york
does
not
work
at
all
at
least
i
could
never
discover
it
working
letters
lingered
in
it
for
days
and
days
as
in
some
wild
village
of
the
pyrenees
when
i
asked
a
to
drive
me
to
a
a
look
of
vision
and
adventure
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
said
he
had
once
heard
of
a
somewhere
near
west
street
men
are
not
efficient
in
everything
but
only
in
the
fashionable
thing
this
may
be
a
mark
of
the
march
of
science
it
does
certainly
in
one
sense
deserve
the
description
of
youth
we
can
imagine
a
very
young
person
forgetting
the
old
toy
in
the
excitement
of
a
new
one
but
on
the
other
hand
american
manners
contain
much
that
is
called
young
in
the
contrary
sense
in
the
sense
of
an
earlier
stage
of
history
there
are
whole
patches
and
particular
aspects
that
seem
to
me
quite
early
victorian
i
can
not
help
having
this
sensation
for
instance
about
the
arrangement
for
smoking
in
the
railway
carriages
there
are
no
smoking
carriages
as
a
rule
but
a
corner
of
each
of
the
great
cars
is
curtained
off
mysteriously
that
a
man
may
go
behind
the
curtain
and
smoke
nobody
thinks
of
a
woman
doing
so
it
is
regarded
as
a
dark
bohemian
and
almost
brutally
masculine
indulgence
exactly
as
it
was
regarded
by
the
dowagers
in
thackeray
novels
indeed
this
is
one
of
the
many
such
cases
in
which
extremes
meet
the
extremes
of
stuffy
antiquity
and
cranky
modernity
the
american
dowager
is
sorry
that
tobacco
was
ever
introduced
and
the
american
suffragette
and
social
reformer
is
considering
whether
tobacco
ought
not
to
be
abolished
the
tone
of
american
society
suggests
some
sort
of
compromise
by
which
women
will
be
allowed
to
smoke
but
men
forbidden
to
do
so
in
one
respect
however
america
is
very
old
indeed
in
one
respect
america
is
more
historic
than
england
i
might
almost
say
more
archaeological
than
england
the
record
of
one
period
of
the
past
morally
remote
and
probably
irrevocable
is
there
preserved
in
a
more
perfect
form
as
a
pagan
city
is
preserved
at
pompeii
in
a
more
general
sense
of
course
it
is
easy
to
exaggerate
the
contrast
as
a
mere
contrast
between
the
old
world
and
the
new
there
is
a
superficial
satire
about
the
millionaire
daughter
who
has
recently
become
the
wife
of
an
aristocrat
but
there
is
a
rather
more
subtle
satire
in
the
question
of
how
long
the
aristocrat
has
been
aristocratic
there
is
often
much
misplaced
mockery
of
a
marriage
between
an
upstart
daughter
and
a
decayed
relic
of
feudalism
when
it
is
really
a
marriage
between
an
upstart
daughter
and
an
upstart
grandson
the
sentimental
socialist
often
seems
to
admit
the
blue
blood
of
the
nobleman
even
when
he
wants
to
shed
it
just
as
he
seems
to
admit
the
marvellous
brains
of
the
millionaire
even
when
he
wants
to
blow
them
out
unfortunately
in
the
interests
of
social
science
of
course
the
sentimental
socialist
never
does
go
so
far
as
bloodshed
or
blowing
out
brains
otherwise
the
colour
and
quality
of
both
blood
and
brains
would
probably
be
a
disappointment
to
him
there
are
certainly
more
american
families
that
really
came
over
in
the
than
english
families
that
really
came
over
with
the
conqueror
and
an
english
county
family
clearly
dating
from
the
time
of
the
would
be
considered
a
very
traditional
and
historic
house
nevertheless
there
are
ancient
things
in
england
though
the
aristocracy
is
hardly
one
of
them
there
are
buildings
there
are
institutions
there
are
even
ideas
in
england
which
do
preserve
as
in
a
perfect
pattern
some
particular
epoch
of
the
past
and
even
of
the
remote
past
a
man
could
study
the
middle
ages
in
lincoln
as
well
as
in
rouen
in
canterbury
as
well
as
in
cologne
even
of
the
renaissance
the
same
is
true
at
least
on
the
literary
side
if
shakespeare
was
later
he
was
also
greater
than
ronsard
but
the
point
is
that
the
spirit
and
philosophy
of
the
periods
were
present
in
fullness
and
in
freedom
the
guildsmen
were
as
christian
in
england
as
they
were
anywhere
the
poets
were
as
pagan
in
england
as
they
were
anywhere
personally
i
do
not
admit
that
the
men
who
served
patrons
were
freer
than
those
who
served
patron
saints
but
each
fashion
had
its
own
kind
of
freedom
and
the
point
is
that
the
english
in
each
case
had
the
fullness
of
that
kind
of
freedom
but
there
was
another
ideal
of
freedom
which
the
english
never
had
at
all
or
anyhow
never
expressed
at
all
there
was
another
ideal
the
soul
of
another
epoch
round
which
we
built
no
monuments
and
wrote
no
masterpieces
you
will
find
no
traces
of
it
in
england
but
you
will
find
them
in
america
the
thing
i
mean
was
the
real
religion
of
the
eighteenth
century
its
religion
in
the
more
defined
sense
was
generally
deism
as
in
robespierre
or
jefferson
in
the
more
general
way
of
morals
and
atmosphere
it
was
rather
stoicism
as
in
the
suicide
of
wolfe
tone
it
had
certain
very
noble
and
as
some
would
say
impossible
ideals
as
that
a
politician
should
be
poor
and
should
be
proud
of
being
poor
it
knew
latin
and
therefore
insisted
on
the
strange
fancy
that
the
republic
should
be
a
public
thing
its
republican
simplicity
was
anything
but
a
silly
pose
unless
all
martyrdom
is
a
silly
pose
even
of
the
prigs
and
fanatics
of
the
american
and
french
revolutions
we
can
often
say
as
stevenson
said
of
an
american
that
and
courage
glowed
in
him
and
its
virtue
and
value
for
us
is
that
it
did
remember
the
things
we
now
most
tend
to
forget
from
the
dignity
of
liberty
to
the
danger
of
luxury
it
did
really
believe
in
in
the
of
the
self
as
well
as
of
the
state
and
its
determination
was
really
determined
in
short
it
believed
in
and
it
is
strictly
true
even
of
its
rebels
and
regicides
that
they
desired
chiefly
to
be
respectable
but
there
were
in
it
the
marks
of
religion
as
well
as
respectability
it
had
a
creed
it
had
a
crusade
men
died
singing
its
songs
men
starved
rather
than
write
against
its
principles
and
its
principles
were
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
or
the
dogmas
of
the
declaration
of
independence
this
was
the
idea
that
redeemed
the
dreary
negations
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
there
are
still
corners
of
philadelphia
or
boston
or
baltimore
where
we
can
feel
so
suddenly
in
the
silence
its
plain
garb
and
formal
manners
that
the
walking
ghost
of
jefferson
would
hardly
surprise
us
there
is
not
the
ghost
of
such
a
thing
in
england
in
england
the
real
religion
of
the
eighteenth
century
never
found
freedom
or
scope
it
never
cleared
a
space
in
which
to
build
that
cold
and
classic
building
called
the
capitol
it
never
made
for
that
free
if
sometimes
frigid
figure
called
the
citizen
in
england
he
was
crowded
out
partly
perhaps
by
the
relics
of
better
things
of
the
past
but
largely
at
least
by
the
presence
of
much
worse
things
in
the
present
the
worst
things
kept
out
the
best
things
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
ground
was
occupied
by
legal
fictions
by
a
godless
erastian
church
and
a
powerless
hanoverian
king
its
realities
were
an
aristocracy
of
regency
dandies
in
costumes
made
to
match
brighton
pavilion
a
paganism
not
frigid
but
florid
it
was
a
touch
of
this
aristocratic
waste
in
fox
that
prevented
that
great
man
from
being
a
glorious
exception
it
is
therefore
well
for
us
to
realise
that
there
is
something
in
history
which
we
did
not
experience
and
therefore
probably
something
in
americans
that
we
do
not
understand
there
was
this
idealism
at
the
very
beginning
of
their
individualism
there
was
a
note
of
heroic
publicity
and
honourable
poverty
which
lingers
in
the
very
name
of
cincinnati
but
i
have
another
and
special
reason
for
noting
this
historical
fact
the
fact
that
we
english
never
made
anything
upon
the
model
of
a
capitol
while
we
can
match
anybody
with
the
model
of
a
cathedral
it
is
far
from
improbable
that
the
latter
model
may
again
be
a
working
model
for
i
have
myself
felt
naturally
and
for
a
long
time
a
warm
sympathy
with
both
those
past
ideals
which
seem
to
some
so
incompatible
i
have
felt
the
attraction
of
the
red
cap
as
well
as
the
red
cross
of
the
marseillaise
as
well
as
the
magnificat
and
even
when
they
were
in
furious
conflict
i
have
never
altogether
lost
my
sympathy
for
either
but
in
the
conflict
between
the
republic
and
the
church
the
point
often
made
against
the
church
seems
to
me
much
more
of
a
point
against
the
republic
it
is
emphatically
the
republic
and
not
the
church
that
i
venerate
as
something
beautiful
but
belonging
to
the
past
in
fact
i
feel
exactly
the
same
sort
of
sad
respect
for
the
republican
ideal
that
many
felt
for
the
religious
ideal
the
most
sincere
poets
of
that
period
were
largely
divided
between
those
who
insisted
like
arnold
and
clough
that
christianity
might
be
a
ruin
but
after
all
it
must
be
treated
as
a
picturesque
ruin
and
those
like
swinburne
who
insisted
that
it
might
be
a
picturesque
ruin
but
after
all
it
must
be
treated
as
a
ruin
but
surely
their
own
pagan
temple
of
political
liberty
is
now
much
more
of
a
ruin
than
the
other
and
i
fancy
i
am
one
of
the
few
who
still
take
off
their
hats
in
that
ruined
temple
that
is
why
i
went
about
looking
for
the
fading
traces
of
that
lost
cause
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
new
world
but
i
do
not
as
a
fact
feel
that
the
cathedral
is
a
ruin
i
doubt
if
i
should
feel
it
even
if
i
wished
to
lay
it
in
ruins
i
doubt
if
really
thinks
that
catholicism
is
dying
though
he
might
deceive
himself
into
saying
so
nobody
could
be
naturally
moved
to
say
that
the
crowded
cathedral
of
patrick
in
new
york
was
a
ruin
or
even
that
the
unfinished
cathedral
at
washington
was
a
ruin
though
it
is
not
yet
a
church
or
that
there
is
anything
lost
or
lingering
about
the
splendid
and
spirited
gothic
churches
springing
up
under
the
inspiration
of
cram
of
boston
as
a
matter
of
feeling
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
a
matter
quite
apart
from
theory
or
opinion
it
is
not
in
the
religious
centres
that
we
now
have
the
feeling
of
something
beautiful
but
receding
of
something
loved
but
lost
it
is
exactly
in
the
spaces
cleared
and
levelled
by
america
for
the
large
and
sober
religion
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
is
where
an
old
house
in
philadelphia
contains
an
old
picture
of
franklin
or
where
the
men
of
maryland
raised
above
their
city
the
first
monument
of
washington
it
is
there
that
i
feel
like
one
who
treads
alone
some
banquet
hall
deserted
whose
lights
are
fled
whose
garlands
dead
and
all
save
he
departed
it
is
then
that
i
feel
as
if
i
were
the
last
republican
but
when
i
say
that
the
republic
of
the
age
of
reason
is
now
a
ruin
i
should
rather
say
that
at
its
best
it
is
a
ruin
at
its
worst
it
has
collapsed
into
a
or
is
rotting
like
a
dunghill
what
is
the
real
republic
of
our
day
as
distinct
from
the
ideal
republic
of
our
fathers
but
a
heap
of
corrupt
capitalism
crawling
with
worms
with
those
parasites
the
professional
politicians
i
was
swinburne
bitter
but
not
ignoble
poem
a
crucifix
in
which
he
bids
christ
or
the
ecclesiastical
image
of
christ
stand
out
of
the
way
of
the
onward
march
of
a
political
idealism
represented
by
united
italy
or
the
french
republic
i
was
struck
by
the
strange
and
ironic
exactitude
with
which
every
taunt
he
flings
at
the
degradation
of
the
old
divine
ideal
would
now
fit
the
degradation
of
his
own
human
ideal
the
time
has
already
come
when
we
can
ask
his
goddess
of
liberty
as
represented
by
the
actual
liberals
filled
full
souls
have
brought
freedom
on
the
earth
for
every
engine
in
which
these
old
firmly
and
confidently
trusted
has
itself
become
an
engine
of
oppression
and
even
of
class
oppression
its
free
parliament
has
become
an
oligarchy
its
free
press
has
become
a
monopoly
if
the
pure
church
has
been
corrupted
in
the
course
of
two
thousand
years
what
about
the
pure
republic
that
has
rotted
into
a
filthy
plutocracy
in
less
than
a
hundred
o
hidden
face
of
man
whereover
the
years
have
woven
a
viewless
veil
if
thou
wert
verily
man
lover
what
did
thy
love
or
blood
avail
thy
blood
the
priests
make
poison
of
and
in
gold
shekels
coin
thy
love
which
has
most
to
do
with
shekels
the
priests
or
the
politicians
can
we
say
in
any
special
sense
nowadays
that
clergymen
as
such
make
a
poison
out
of
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
can
we
say
it
in
anything
like
the
real
sense
in
which
we
do
say
that
yellow
journalists
make
a
poison
out
of
the
blood
of
the
soldiers
but
i
understand
how
swinburne
felt
when
confronted
by
the
image
of
the
carven
christ
and
perplexed
by
the
contrast
between
its
claims
and
its
consequences
he
said
his
strange
farewell
to
it
hastily
indeed
but
not
without
regret
not
even
really
without
respect
i
felt
the
same
myself
when
i
looked
for
the
last
time
on
the
statue
of
liberty
footnote
in
the
conclusion
of
this
chapter
i
mean
by
the
republic
not
merely
the
american
republic
but
the
whole
modern
representative
system
as
in
france
or
even
in
england
the
atlantic
narrowing
a
certain
kind
of
question
is
asked
very
earnestly
in
our
time
because
of
a
certain
logical
quality
in
it
connected
with
premises
and
data
it
is
very
difficult
to
answer
thus
people
will
ask
what
is
the
hidden
weakness
in
the
celtic
race
that
makes
them
everywhere
fail
or
fade
away
or
how
the
germans
contrived
to
bring
all
their
organisation
into
a
state
of
such
perfect
efficiency
and
what
was
the
significance
of
the
recent
victory
of
prussia
or
they
will
ask
by
what
stages
the
modern
world
has
abandoned
all
belief
in
miracles
and
the
modern
newspapers
ceased
to
print
any
news
of
murders
they
will
ask
why
english
politics
are
free
from
corruption
or
by
what
mental
and
moral
training
certain
millionaires
were
enabled
to
succeed
by
sheer
force
of
character
in
short
they
will
ask
why
plutocrats
govern
well
and
how
it
is
that
pigs
fly
spreading
their
pink
pinions
to
the
breeze
or
delighting
us
as
they
twitter
and
flutter
from
tree
to
tree
the
logical
difficulty
of
answering
these
questions
is
connected
with
an
old
story
about
charles
the
second
and
a
bowl
of
goldfish
and
with
another
anecdote
about
a
gentleman
who
was
asked
did
you
leave
off
beating
your
wife
but
there
is
something
analogous
to
it
in
the
present
discussions
about
the
forces
drawing
england
and
america
together
it
seems
as
if
the
reasoners
hardly
went
far
enough
back
in
their
argument
or
took
trouble
enough
to
disentangle
their
assumptions
they
are
still
moving
with
the
momentum
of
the
peculiar
notion
of
progress
of
certain
very
simple
tendencies
perpetually
increasing
and
needing
no
special
analysis
it
is
so
with
the
international
i
have
to
consider
here
in
other
places
i
have
ventured
to
express
a
doubt
about
whether
nations
can
be
drawn
together
by
an
ancient
rumour
about
races
by
a
sort
of
prehistoric
or
the
gossip
of
the
stone
age
i
have
ventured
farther
and
even
expressed
a
doubt
about
whether
they
ought
to
be
drawn
together
or
rather
dragged
together
by
the
brute
violence
of
the
engines
of
science
and
speed
but
there
is
yet
another
horrible
doubt
haunting
my
morbid
mind
which
it
will
be
better
for
my
constitution
to
confess
frankly
and
that
is
the
doubt
about
whether
they
are
being
drawn
together
at
all
it
has
long
been
a
conversational
commonplace
among
the
enlightened
that
all
countries
are
coming
closer
and
closer
to
each
other
it
was
a
conversational
commonplace
among
the
enlightened
somewhere
about
the
year
that
all
wars
were
receding
farther
and
farther
into
a
barbaric
past
there
is
something
about
these
sayings
that
seems
simple
and
familiar
and
entirely
satisfactory
when
we
say
them
they
are
of
that
consoling
sort
which
we
can
say
without
any
of
the
mental
pain
of
thinking
what
we
are
saying
but
if
we
turn
our
attention
from
the
phrases
we
use
to
the
facts
that
we
talk
about
we
shall
realise
at
least
that
there
are
a
good
many
facts
on
the
other
side
and
examples
pointing
the
other
way
for
instance
it
does
happen
occasionally
from
time
to
time
that
people
talk
about
ireland
he
would
be
a
very
hilarious
humanitarian
who
should
maintain
that
ireland
and
england
have
been
more
and
more
assimilated
during
the
last
hundred
years
the
very
name
of
sinn
fein
is
an
answer
to
it
and
the
very
language
in
which
that
phrase
is
spoken
curran
and
sheil
would
no
more
have
dreamed
of
uttering
the
watchword
of
in
gaelic
than
of
uttering
it
in
zulu
grattan
could
hardly
have
brought
himself
to
believe
that
the
real
repeal
of
the
union
would
actually
be
signed
in
london
in
the
strange
script
as
remote
as
the
snaky
ornament
of
the
celtic
crosses
it
would
have
seemed
like
washington
signing
the
declaration
of
independence
in
the
of
the
red
indians
ireland
has
clearly
grown
away
from
england
and
her
language
literature
and
type
of
patriotism
are
far
less
english
than
they
were
on
the
other
hand
no
one
will
pretend
that
the
mass
of
modern
englishmen
are
much
nearer
to
talking
gaelic
or
decorating
celtic
crosses
a
hundred
years
ago
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
byron
and
moore
should
walk
down
the
street
arm
in
arm
even
the
sight
of
rudyard
kipling
and
yeats
walking
down
the
street
arm
in
arm
would
now
arouse
some
remark
i
could
give
any
number
of
other
examples
of
the
same
new
estrangement
of
nations
i
could
cite
the
obvious
facts
that
norway
and
sweden
parted
company
not
very
long
ago
that
austria
and
hungary
have
again
become
separate
states
i
could
point
to
the
mob
of
new
nations
that
have
started
up
after
the
war
to
the
fact
that
the
great
empires
are
now
nearly
all
broken
up
that
the
russian
empire
no
longer
directs
poland
that
the
austrian
empire
no
longer
directs
bohemia
that
the
turkish
empire
no
longer
directs
palestine
sinn
fein
is
the
separatism
of
the
irish
zionism
is
the
separatism
of
the
jews
but
there
is
one
simple
and
sufficing
example
which
is
here
more
to
my
purpose
and
is
at
least
equally
sufficient
for
it
and
that
is
the
deepening
national
difference
between
the
americans
and
the
english
let
me
test
it
first
by
my
individual
experience
in
the
matter
of
literature
when
i
was
a
boy
i
read
a
book
like
autocrat
of
the
exactly
as
i
read
another
book
like
book
of
i
did
not
think
of
it
as
an
american
book
but
simply
as
a
book
its
wit
and
idiom
were
like
those
of
the
english
literary
tradition
and
its
few
touches
of
local
colour
seemed
merely
accidental
like
those
of
an
englishman
who
happened
to
be
living
in
switzerland
or
sweden
my
father
and
my
father
friends
were
rightly
enthusiastic
for
the
book
so
that
it
seemed
to
come
to
me
by
inheritance
like
or
its
language
was
as
english
as
ruskin
and
a
great
deal
more
english
than
carlyle
well
i
have
seen
in
later
years
an
almost
equally
wide
and
popularity
of
the
stories
of
henry
but
never
for
one
moment
could
i
or
any
one
else
reading
them
forget
that
they
were
stories
by
an
american
about
america
the
very
first
fact
about
them
is
that
they
are
told
with
an
american
accent
that
is
in
the
unmistakable
tones
of
a
brilliant
and
fascinating
foreigner
and
the
same
is
true
of
every
other
recent
work
of
which
the
fame
has
managed
to
cross
the
atlantic
we
did
not
say
that
spoon
river
was
a
new
book
but
that
it
was
a
new
book
from
america
it
was
exactly
as
if
a
remarkable
realistic
novel
was
reported
from
russia
or
italy
we
were
in
no
danger
of
confusing
it
with
the
in
a
country
churchyard
people
in
england
who
heard
of
main
street
were
not
likely
to
identify
it
with
a
high
street
with
the
principal
thoroughfare
in
any
little
town
in
berkshire
or
buckinghamshire
but
when
i
was
a
boy
i
practically
identified
the
of
the
autocrat
with
any
i
happened
to
know
in
brompton
or
brighton
no
doubt
there
were
differences
but
the
point
is
that
the
differences
did
not
pierce
the
consciousness
or
prick
the
illusion
i
said
to
myself
are
like
this
in
not
are
like
this
in
boston
this
can
be
seen
even
in
the
simple
matter
of
language
especially
in
the
sense
of
slang
take
for
instance
the
delightful
sketch
in
the
causerie
of
oliver
wendell
holmes
the
character
of
the
young
man
called
john
he
is
the
very
modern
type
in
every
modern
country
who
does
specialise
in
slang
he
is
the
young
fellow
who
is
something
in
the
city
the
everyday
young
man
of
the
gilbertian
song
with
a
stick
and
a
pipe
and
a
in
every
country
he
is
at
once
witty
and
commonplace
in
every
country
therefore
he
tends
both
to
the
vivacity
and
the
vulgarity
of
slang
but
when
he
appeared
in
book
his
language
was
not
very
different
from
what
it
would
have
been
in
a
brighton
instead
of
a
boston
or
in
short
if
the
young
man
called
john
had
more
commonly
been
called
if
he
had
appeared
in
a
modern
american
book
his
language
would
have
been
almost
literally
unintelligible
at
the
least
an
englishman
would
have
had
to
read
some
of
the
best
sentences
twice
as
he
sometimes
has
to
read
the
dizzy
and
involved
metaphors
of
henry
nor
is
it
an
answer
that
this
depended
on
the
personalities
of
the
particular
writers
a
comparison
between
the
real
journalism
of
the
time
of
holmes
and
the
real
journalism
of
the
time
of
henry
reveals
the
same
thing
it
is
the
expansion
of
a
slight
difference
of
style
into
a
luxuriant
difference
of
idiom
and
the
process
continued
indefinitely
would
certainly
produce
a
totally
different
language
after
a
few
centuries
the
signatures
of
american
ambassadors
would
look
as
fantastic
as
gaelic
and
the
very
name
of
the
republic
be
as
strange
as
sinn
fein
it
is
true
that
there
has
been
on
the
surface
a
certain
amount
of
give
and
take
or
at
least
as
far
as
the
english
are
concerned
of
take
rather
than
give
but
it
is
true
that
it
was
once
all
the
other
way
and
indeed
the
one
thing
is
something
like
a
just
nemesis
of
the
other
indeed
the
story
of
the
reversal
is
somewhat
singular
when
we
come
to
think
of
it
it
began
in
a
certain
atmosphere
and
spirit
of
certain
people
who
talked
about
the
race
and
were
apparently
indifferent
to
how
the
english
was
spoken
whether
in
the
accent
of
a
jamaican
negro
or
a
convict
from
botany
bay
it
was
their
logical
tendency
to
say
that
dante
was
a
dago
it
was
their
logical
punishment
to
say
that
disraeli
was
an
englishman
now
there
may
have
been
a
period
when
this
amalgamation
included
more
or
less
equal
elements
from
england
and
america
it
never
included
the
larger
elements
or
the
more
valuable
elements
of
either
but
on
the
whole
i
think
it
true
to
say
that
it
was
not
an
allotment
but
an
interchange
of
parts
and
that
things
first
went
all
one
way
and
then
all
the
other
people
began
by
telling
the
americans
that
they
owed
all
their
past
triumphs
to
england
which
was
false
they
ended
up
by
telling
the
english
that
they
would
owe
all
their
future
triumphs
to
america
which
is
if
possible
still
more
false
because
we
chose
to
forget
that
new
york
had
been
new
amsterdam
we
are
now
in
danger
of
forgetting
that
london
is
not
new
york
because
we
insisted
that
chicago
was
only
a
pious
imitation
of
chiswick
we
may
yet
see
chiswick
an
inferior
imitation
of
chicago
our
historians
attempted
that
conquest
in
which
howe
and
burgoyne
had
failed
and
with
infinitely
less
justification
on
their
side
they
attempted
the
great
crime
of
the
anglicisation
of
america
they
have
called
down
the
punishment
of
the
americanisation
of
england
we
must
not
murmur
but
it
is
a
heavy
punishment
it
may
lift
a
little
of
its
load
however
if
we
look
at
it
more
closely
we
shall
then
find
that
though
it
is
very
much
on
top
of
us
it
is
only
on
top
in
that
sense
such
americanisation
as
there
is
is
very
superficial
for
instance
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
american
slang
picked
up
at
random
it
appears
in
certain
pushing
types
of
journalism
and
drama
but
we
may
easily
dwell
too
much
on
this
tragedy
of
people
who
have
never
spoken
english
beginning
to
speak
american
i
am
far
from
suggesting
that
american
like
any
other
foreign
language
may
not
frequently
contribute
to
the
common
culture
of
the
world
phrases
for
which
there
is
no
substitute
there
are
french
phrases
so
used
in
england
and
english
phrases
in
france
the
word
for
instance
is
a
real
discovery
and
revelation
a
new
and
necessary
name
for
something
that
walked
nameless
but
enormous
in
the
modern
world
a
shaft
of
light
and
a
stroke
of
lightning
that
comes
from
america
and
belongs
to
the
world
as
much
as
raven
or
scarlet
or
the
novels
of
henry
james
belong
to
the
world
in
fact
i
can
imagine
henry
james
originating
it
in
the
throes
of
and
bringing
out
a
word
like
with
a
sort
of
gentle
jerk
at
the
end
of
searching
sentences
which
groped
sensitively
until
they
found
the
phrase
but
most
of
the
american
slang
that
is
borrowed
seems
to
be
borrowed
for
no
particular
reason
it
either
has
no
point
or
the
point
is
lost
by
translation
into
another
context
and
culture
it
is
either
something
which
does
not
need
any
grotesque
and
exaggerative
description
or
of
which
there
already
exists
a
grotesque
and
exaggerative
description
more
native
to
our
tongue
and
soil
for
instance
i
can
not
see
that
the
strong
and
simple
expression
it
is
for
you
to
pull
the
police
magistrate
nose
is
in
any
way
strengthened
by
saying
it
is
up
to
you
to
pull
the
police
magistrate
nose
when
tennyson
says
of
the
men
of
the
light
brigade
but
to
do
and
die
the
expression
seems
to
me
perfectly
lucid
to
them
to
do
and
die
would
alter
the
metre
without
especially
clarifying
the
meaning
this
is
an
example
of
ordinary
language
being
quite
adequate
but
there
is
a
further
difficulty
that
even
wild
slang
comes
to
sound
like
ordinary
language
very
often
the
english
have
already
as
humorous
and
fanciful
idiom
of
their
own
only
that
through
habit
it
has
lost
its
humour
when
keats
wrote
the
line
pipes
and
timbrels
what
wild
ecstasy
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
the
american
humorist
would
have
expressed
the
same
sentiment
by
beginning
the
sentence
with
pipe
when
that
was
first
said
somewhere
in
the
wilds
of
colorado
it
was
really
funny
involving
a
powerful
understatement
and
the
suggestion
of
a
mere
sample
if
a
spinster
has
informed
us
that
she
keeps
a
bird
and
we
find
it
is
an
ostrich
there
will
be
considerable
point
in
the
colorado
satirist
saying
inquiringly
bird
as
if
he
were
offering
us
a
small
slice
of
a
small
plover
but
if
we
go
back
to
this
root
and
rationale
of
a
joke
the
english
language
already
contains
quite
as
good
a
joke
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
bird
there
is
a
far
finer
irony
in
the
old
expression
like
a
bird
it
suggests
that
the
speaker
sees
something
faintly
and
strangely
birdlike
about
a
bird
that
it
remotely
and
almost
irrationally
reminds
him
of
a
bird
and
that
there
is
about
ostrich
plumes
a
yard
long
something
like
the
faint
and
delicate
traces
of
a
feather
it
has
every
quality
of
imaginative
irony
except
that
nobody
even
imagines
it
to
be
ironical
all
that
happens
is
that
people
get
tired
of
that
turn
of
phrase
take
up
a
foreign
phrase
and
get
tired
of
that
without
realising
the
point
of
either
all
that
happens
is
that
a
number
of
weary
people
who
used
to
say
like
a
bird
now
say
bird
with
undiminished
weariness
but
they
might
just
as
well
use
dull
and
decent
english
for
in
both
cases
they
are
only
using
jocular
language
without
seeing
the
joke
there
is
indeed
a
considerable
trade
in
the
transplantation
of
these
american
jokes
to
england
just
now
they
generally
pine
and
die
in
our
climate
or
they
are
dead
before
their
arrival
but
we
can
not
be
certain
that
they
were
never
alive
there
is
a
sort
of
unending
frieze
or
scroll
of
decorative
designs
unrolled
ceaselessly
before
the
british
public
about
a
husband
which
is
indistinguishable
to
the
eye
from
an
actual
pattern
like
that
of
the
greek
key
but
which
is
imported
as
if
it
were
as
precious
and
irreplaceable
as
the
elgin
marbles
advertisement
and
syndication
make
mountains
out
of
the
most
funny
little
but
no
doubt
the
are
picturesque
enough
in
their
own
landscape
in
any
case
there
is
nothing
so
national
as
humour
and
many
things
like
many
people
can
be
humorous
enough
when
they
are
at
home
but
these
american
jokes
are
boomed
as
solemnly
as
american
religions
and
their
supporters
gravely
testify
that
they
are
funny
without
seeing
the
fun
of
it
for
a
moment
this
is
partly
perhaps
the
spirit
of
spontaneous
institutionalism
in
american
democracy
breaking
out
in
the
wrong
place
they
make
humour
an
institution
and
a
man
will
be
set
to
tell
an
anecdote
as
if
to
play
the
violin
but
when
the
story
is
told
in
america
it
really
is
amusing
and
when
these
jokes
are
reprinted
in
england
they
are
often
not
even
intelligible
with
all
the
stupidity
of
the
millionaire
and
the
monopolist
the
enterprising
proprietor
prints
jokes
in
england
which
are
necessarily
unintelligible
to
nearly
every
english
person
jokes
referring
to
domestic
and
local
conditions
quite
peculiar
to
america
i
saw
one
of
these
narrative
caricatures
the
other
day
in
which
the
whole
of
the
joke
what
there
was
of
it
turned
on
the
astonishment
of
a
housewife
at
the
absurd
notion
of
not
having
an
it
is
perfectly
true
that
nearly
every
ordinary
american
housewife
possesses
an
an
ordinary
english
housewife
would
no
more
expect
to
possess
an
than
to
possess
an
iceberg
and
it
would
be
about
as
sensible
to
tow
an
iceberg
to
an
english
port
all
the
way
from
the
north
pole
as
to
trail
that
one
pale
and
frigid
joke
to
fleet
street
all
the
way
from
the
new
york
papers
it
is
the
same
with
a
hundred
other
advertisements
and
adaptations
i
have
already
confessed
that
i
took
a
considerable
delight
in
the
dancing
illuminations
of
broadway
in
broadway
everything
there
is
suitable
to
them
the
vast
interminable
thoroughfare
the
toppling
houses
the
dizzy
and
restless
spirit
of
the
whole
city
it
is
a
city
of
dissolving
views
and
one
may
almost
say
a
city
in
everlasting
dissolution
but
i
do
not
especially
admire
a
burning
fragment
of
broadway
stuck
up
opposite
the
old
georgian
curve
of
regent
street
i
would
as
soon
express
sympathy
with
the
republic
of
switzerland
by
erecting
a
small
alp
with
imitation
snow
in
the
middle
of
park
but
all
this
commercial
copying
is
very
superficial
and
above
all
it
never
copies
anything
that
is
really
worth
copying
nations
never
anything
from
each
other
in
this
way
we
have
many
things
to
learn
from
america
but
we
only
listen
to
those
americans
who
have
still
to
learn
them
thus
for
instance
we
do
not
import
the
small
farm
but
only
the
big
shop
in
other
words
we
hear
nothing
of
the
democracy
of
the
middle
west
but
everything
of
the
plutocracy
of
the
middleman
who
is
probably
as
unpopular
in
the
middle
west
as
the
miller
in
the
middle
ages
if
elihu
pike
could
be
transplanted
bodily
from
the
neighbourhood
of
his
home
town
of
marathon
with
his
farm
and
his
and
all
its
fittings
and
they
could
be
set
down
exactly
in
the
spot
now
occupied
by
selfridge
which
could
be
easily
cleared
away
for
the
purpose
i
think
we
could
really
get
a
great
deal
of
good
by
watching
him
even
if
the
watching
were
inevitably
a
little
too
like
watching
a
wild
beast
in
a
cage
or
an
insect
under
a
glass
case
urban
crowds
could
collect
every
day
behind
a
barrier
or
railing
and
gaze
at
pike
pottering
about
all
day
in
his
ancient
and
autochthonous
occupations
we
could
see
him
growing
indian
corn
with
all
the
gravity
of
an
indian
though
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
pike
blessing
the
cornfield
in
the
manner
of
minnehaha
as
i
have
said
there
is
a
certain
lack
of
humane
myth
and
mysticism
about
this
puritan
peasantry
but
we
could
see
him
transforming
the
maize
into
which
is
a
very
pleasant
domestic
ritual
and
pastime
and
is
the
american
equivalent
of
the
glory
of
roasting
chestnuts
above
all
many
of
us
would
learn
for
the
first
time
that
a
man
can
really
live
and
walk
about
upon
something
more
productive
than
a
pavement
and
that
when
he
does
so
he
can
really
be
a
free
man
and
have
no
lord
but
the
law
instead
of
that
america
can
give
nothing
to
london
but
those
multiple
modern
shops
of
which
it
has
too
many
already
i
know
that
many
people
entertain
the
innocent
illusion
that
big
shops
are
more
efficient
than
small
ones
but
that
is
only
because
the
big
combinations
have
the
monopoly
of
advertisement
as
well
as
trade
the
big
shop
is
not
in
the
least
remarkable
for
efficiency
it
is
only
too
big
to
be
blamed
for
its
inefficiency
it
is
secure
in
its
reputation
for
always
sacking
the
wrong
man
a
big
shop
considered
as
a
place
to
shop
in
is
simply
a
village
of
small
shops
roofed
in
to
keep
out
the
light
and
air
and
one
in
which
none
of
the
shopkeepers
is
really
responsible
for
his
shop
if
any
one
has
any
doubts
on
this
matter
since
i
have
mentioned
it
let
him
consider
this
fact
that
in
practice
we
never
do
apply
this
method
of
commercial
combination
to
anything
that
matters
very
much
we
do
not
go
to
the
surgical
department
of
the
stores
to
have
a
portion
of
our
brain
removed
by
a
delicate
operation
and
then
pass
on
to
the
advocacy
department
to
employ
one
or
any
of
its
barristers
when
we
are
in
temporary
danger
of
being
hanged
we
go
to
men
who
own
their
own
tools
and
are
responsible
for
the
use
of
their
own
talents
and
the
same
truth
applies
to
that
other
modern
method
of
advertisement
which
has
also
so
largely
fallen
across
us
like
the
gigantic
shadow
of
america
nations
do
not
arm
themselves
for
a
mortal
struggle
by
remembering
which
sort
of
submarine
they
have
seen
most
often
on
the
hoardings
they
can
do
it
about
something
like
soap
precisely
because
a
nation
will
not
perish
by
having
a
sort
of
soap
as
it
might
by
having
a
sort
of
submarine
a
nation
may
indeed
perish
slowly
by
having
a
sort
of
food
or
drink
or
medicine
but
that
is
another
and
much
longer
story
and
the
story
is
not
ended
yet
but
nobody
wins
a
great
battle
at
a
great
crisis
because
somebody
has
told
him
that
cadgerboy
cavalry
is
the
best
it
may
be
that
commercial
enterprise
will
eventually
cover
these
fields
also
and
will
provide
the
instruments
of
the
surgeon
and
the
weapons
of
the
soldier
when
that
happens
the
armies
will
be
defeated
and
the
patients
will
die
but
though
we
modern
people
are
indeed
patients
in
the
sense
of
being
merely
receptive
and
accepting
things
with
astonishing
patience
we
are
not
dead
yet
and
we
have
lingering
gleams
of
sanity
for
the
best
things
do
not
travel
as
i
appear
here
as
a
traveller
i
may
say
with
all
modesty
that
the
best
people
do
not
travel
either
both
in
england
and
america
the
normal
people
are
the
national
people
and
i
repeat
that
i
think
they
are
growing
more
and
more
national
i
do
not
think
the
abyss
is
being
bridged
by
cosmopolitan
theories
and
i
am
sure
i
do
not
want
it
bridged
by
all
this
slang
journalism
and
blatant
advertisement
i
have
called
all
that
commercial
publicity
the
gigantic
shadow
of
america
it
may
be
the
shadow
of
america
but
it
is
not
the
light
of
america
the
light
lies
far
beyond
a
level
light
upon
the
lands
of
sunset
where
it
shines
upon
wide
places
full
of
a
very
simple
and
a
very
happy
people
and
those
who
would
see
it
must
seek
for
it
and
lost
it
has
already
been
remarked
here
that
the
english
know
a
great
deal
about
past
american
literature
but
nothing
about
past
american
history
they
do
not
know
either
of
course
as
well
as
they
know
the
present
american
advertising
which
is
the
least
important
of
the
three
but
it
is
worth
noting
once
more
how
little
they
know
of
the
history
and
how
illogically
that
little
is
chosen
they
have
heard
no
doubt
of
the
fame
and
the
greatness
of
henry
clay
he
is
a
cigar
but
it
would
be
unwise
to
any
englishman
who
may
be
consuming
that
luxury
at
the
moment
about
the
missouri
compromise
or
the
controversies
with
andrew
jackson
and
just
as
the
statesman
of
kentucky
is
a
cigar
so
the
state
of
virginia
is
a
cigarette
but
there
is
perhaps
one
exception
or
to
this
simple
plan
it
would
perhaps
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
plymouth
rock
is
a
chicken
any
english
person
keeping
chickens
and
chiefly
interested
in
plymouth
rocks
considered
as
chickens
would
nevertheless
have
a
hazy
sensation
of
having
seen
the
word
somewhere
before
he
would
feel
subconsciously
that
the
plymouth
rock
had
not
always
been
a
chicken
indeed
the
name
connotes
something
not
only
solid
but
antiquated
and
is
not
therefore
a
very
tactful
name
for
a
chicken
there
would
rise
up
before
him
something
memorable
in
the
haze
that
he
calls
his
history
and
he
would
see
the
history
books
of
his
boyhood
and
old
engravings
of
men
in
hats
struggling
with
or
red
indians
the
whole
thing
would
suddenly
become
clear
to
him
if
by
a
simple
reform
the
chickens
were
called
pilgrim
fathers
then
he
would
remember
all
about
it
the
pilgrim
fathers
were
champions
of
religious
liberty
and
they
discovered
america
it
is
true
that
he
has
also
heard
of
a
man
called
christopher
columbus
but
that
was
in
connection
with
an
egg
he
has
also
heard
of
somebody
known
as
sir
walter
raleigh
and
though
his
principal
possession
was
a
cloak
it
is
also
true
that
he
had
a
potato
not
to
mention
a
pipe
of
tobacco
can
it
be
possible
that
he
brought
it
from
virginia
where
the
cigarettes
come
from
gradually
the
memories
will
come
back
and
fit
themselves
together
for
the
average
who
learnt
history
at
the
english
elementary
schools
and
who
has
now
something
better
to
do
even
when
the
narrative
becomes
consecutive
it
will
not
necessarily
become
correct
it
is
not
strictly
true
to
say
that
the
pilgrim
fathers
discovered
america
but
it
is
quite
as
true
as
saying
that
they
were
champions
of
religious
liberty
if
we
said
that
they
were
martyrs
who
would
have
died
heroically
in
torments
rather
than
tolerate
any
religious
liberty
we
should
be
talking
something
like
sense
about
them
and
telling
the
real
truth
that
is
their
due
the
whole
puritan
movement
from
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
to
the
last
stand
of
the
last
stuarts
was
a
struggle
religious
toleration
or
what
they
would
have
called
religious
indifference
the
first
religious
equality
on
earth
was
established
by
a
catholic
cavalier
in
maryland
now
there
is
nothing
in
this
to
diminish
any
dignity
that
belongs
to
any
real
virtues
and
virilities
in
the
pilgrim
fathers
on
the
contrary
it
is
rather
to
the
credit
of
their
consistency
and
conviction
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
note
of
their
whole
experiment
in
new
england
was
intolerance
and
even
inquisition
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
new
england
was
then
only
the
newest
and
not
the
oldest
of
these
colonial
experiments
at
least
two
cavaliers
had
been
in
the
field
before
any
puritans
and
they
had
carried
with
them
much
more
of
the
atmosphere
and
nature
of
the
normal
englishman
than
any
puritan
could
possibly
carry
they
had
established
it
especially
in
virginia
which
had
been
founded
by
a
great
elizabethan
and
named
after
the
great
elizabeth
before
there
was
any
new
england
in
the
north
there
was
something
very
like
old
england
in
the
south
relatively
speaking
there
is
still
whenever
the
anniversary
of
the
comes
round
there
is
a
chorus
of
congratulation
and
comradeship
as
if
this
at
least
were
a
matter
on
which
all
can
agree
but
i
knew
enough
about
america
even
before
i
went
there
to
know
that
there
are
a
good
many
people
there
at
any
rate
who
do
not
agree
with
it
long
ago
i
wrote
a
protest
in
which
i
asked
why
englishmen
had
forgotten
the
great
state
of
virginia
the
first
in
foundation
and
long
the
first
in
leadership
and
why
a
few
crabbed
nonconformists
should
have
the
right
to
erase
a
record
that
begins
with
raleigh
and
ends
with
lee
and
incidentally
includes
washington
the
great
state
of
virginia
was
the
backbone
of
america
until
it
was
broken
in
the
civil
war
from
virginia
came
the
first
great
presidents
and
most
of
the
fathers
of
the
republic
its
adherence
to
the
southern
side
in
the
war
made
it
a
great
war
and
for
a
long
time
a
doubtful
war
and
in
the
leader
of
the
southern
armies
it
produced
what
is
perhaps
the
one
modern
figure
that
may
come
to
shine
like
louis
in
the
lost
battle
or
hector
dying
before
holy
troy
again
it
is
characteristic
that
while
the
modern
english
know
nothing
about
lee
they
do
know
something
about
lincoln
and
nearly
all
that
they
know
is
wrong
they
know
nothing
of
his
southern
connections
nothing
of
his
considerable
southern
sympathy
nothing
of
the
meaning
of
his
moderation
in
face
of
the
problem
of
slavery
now
lightly
treated
as
above
all
they
know
nothing
about
the
respect
in
which
lincoln
was
quite
was
indeed
the
very
reverse
of
english
and
can
be
understood
better
if
we
think
of
him
as
a
frenchman
since
it
seems
so
hard
for
some
of
us
to
believe
that
he
was
an
american
i
mean
his
lust
for
logic
for
its
own
sake
and
the
way
he
kept
mathematical
truths
in
his
mind
like
the
fixed
stars
he
was
so
far
from
being
a
merely
practical
man
impatient
of
academic
abstractions
that
he
reviewed
and
revelled
in
academic
abstractions
even
while
he
could
not
apply
them
to
practical
life
he
loved
to
repeat
that
slavery
was
intolerable
while
he
tolerated
it
and
to
prove
that
something
ought
to
be
done
while
it
was
impossible
to
do
it
this
was
probably
very
bewildering
to
his
for
politicians
always
whitewash
what
they
do
not
destroy
but
for
all
that
this
inconsistent
consistency
beat
the
politicians
at
their
own
game
and
this
abstracted
logic
proved
the
most
practical
of
all
for
when
the
chance
did
come
to
do
something
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
thing
to
be
done
the
thunderbolt
fell
from
the
clear
heights
of
heaven
it
had
not
been
tossed
about
and
lost
like
a
common
missile
in
the
the
matter
is
worth
mentioning
because
it
has
a
moral
for
a
much
larger
modern
question
a
wise
man
attitude
towards
industrial
capitalism
will
be
very
like
lincoln
attitude
towards
slavery
that
is
he
will
manage
to
endure
capitalism
but
he
will
not
endure
a
defence
of
capitalism
he
will
recognise
the
value
not
only
of
knowing
what
he
is
doing
but
of
knowing
what
he
would
like
to
do
he
will
recognise
the
importance
of
having
a
thing
clearly
labelled
in
his
own
mind
as
bad
long
before
the
opportunity
comes
to
abolish
it
he
may
recognise
the
risk
of
even
worse
things
in
immediate
abolition
as
lincoln
did
in
abolitionism
he
will
not
call
all
business
men
brutes
any
more
than
lincoln
would
call
all
planters
demons
because
he
knows
they
are
not
he
will
regard
many
alternatives
to
capitalism
as
crude
and
inhuman
as
lincoln
regarded
john
brown
raid
because
they
are
but
he
will
clear
his
from
cant
about
capitalism
he
will
have
no
doubt
of
what
is
the
truth
about
trusts
and
trade
combines
and
the
concentration
of
capital
and
it
is
the
truth
that
they
endure
under
one
of
the
ironic
silences
of
heaven
over
the
pageants
and
the
passing
triumphs
of
hell
but
the
name
of
lincoln
has
a
more
immediate
reference
to
the
international
matters
i
am
considering
here
his
name
has
been
much
invoked
by
english
politicians
and
journalists
in
connection
with
the
quarrel
with
ireland
and
if
we
study
the
matter
we
shall
hardly
admire
the
tact
and
sagacity
of
those
journalists
and
politicians
history
is
an
eternal
tangle
of
and
we
could
not
take
a
clearer
case
or
rather
a
more
complicated
case
of
such
a
tangle
than
the
facts
lying
behind
a
political
parallel
recently
mentioned
by
many
politicians
i
mean
the
parallel
between
the
movement
for
irish
independence
and
the
attempted
secession
of
the
southern
confederacy
in
america
superficially
any
one
might
say
that
the
comparison
is
natural
enough
and
that
there
is
much
in
common
between
the
quarrel
of
the
north
and
south
in
ireland
and
the
quarrel
of
the
north
and
south
in
america
in
both
cases
the
south
was
on
the
whole
agricultural
the
north
on
the
whole
industrial
true
the
parallel
exaggerates
the
position
of
belfast
to
complete
it
we
must
suppose
the
whole
federal
system
to
have
consisted
of
pittsburg
in
both
the
side
that
was
more
successful
was
felt
by
many
to
be
less
attractive
in
both
the
same
political
terms
were
used
such
as
the
term
and
an
ordinary
englishman
comes
to
america
knowing
these
main
lines
of
american
history
and
knowing
that
the
american
knows
the
similar
main
lines
of
irish
history
he
knows
that
there
are
strong
champions
of
ireland
in
america
possibly
he
also
knows
that
there
are
very
genuine
champions
of
england
in
america
by
every
possible
historical
analogy
he
would
naturally
expect
to
find
the
in
the
south
and
the
in
the
north
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
finds
almost
exactly
the
opposite
he
finds
boston
governed
by
irishmen
and
nashville
containing
people
more
than
englishmen
he
finds
virginians
not
only
of
british
blood
like
george
washington
but
of
british
opinions
almost
worthy
of
george
the
third
but
i
do
not
say
this
as
will
be
seen
in
a
moment
as
a
criticism
of
the
comparative
toryism
of
the
south
i
say
it
as
a
criticism
of
the
superlative
stupidity
of
english
propaganda
on
another
page
i
remark
on
the
need
for
a
new
sort
of
english
propaganda
a
propaganda
that
should
be
really
english
and
have
some
remote
reference
to
england
now
if
it
were
a
matter
of
making
foreigners
feel
the
real
humours
and
humanities
of
england
there
are
no
americans
so
able
or
willing
to
do
it
as
the
americans
of
the
southern
states
as
i
have
already
hinted
some
of
them
are
so
loyal
to
the
english
humanities
that
they
think
it
their
duty
to
defend
even
the
english
inhumanities
new
england
is
turning
into
new
ireland
but
old
england
can
still
be
faintly
traced
in
old
dixie
it
contains
some
of
the
best
things
that
england
herself
has
had
and
therefore
of
course
the
things
that
england
herself
has
lost
or
is
trying
to
lose
but
above
all
as
i
have
said
there
are
people
in
these
places
whose
historic
memories
and
family
traditions
really
hold
them
to
us
not
by
alliance
but
by
affection
indeed
they
have
the
affection
in
spite
of
the
alliance
they
love
us
in
spite
of
our
compliments
and
courtesies
and
hands
across
the
sea
all
our
ambassadorial
salutations
and
speeches
can
not
kill
their
love
they
manage
even
to
respect
us
in
spite
of
the
shady
jew
stockbrokers
we
send
them
as
english
envoys
or
the
men
who
are
sent
out
to
be
tactful
with
foreigners
because
they
have
been
too
tactless
with
trades
unionists
this
type
of
traditional
american
north
or
south
really
has
some
traditions
connecting
him
with
england
and
though
he
is
now
in
a
very
small
minority
i
can
not
imagine
why
england
should
wish
to
make
it
smaller
england
once
sympathised
with
the
south
the
south
still
sympathises
with
england
it
would
seem
that
the
south
or
some
elements
in
the
south
had
rather
the
advantage
of
us
in
political
firmness
and
fidelity
but
it
does
not
follow
that
that
fidelity
will
stand
every
shock
and
at
this
moment
and
in
this
matter
of
all
things
in
the
world
our
political
propagandists
must
try
to
bolster
british
imperialism
up
by
kicking
southern
secession
when
it
is
down
the
english
politicians
eagerly
point
out
that
we
shall
be
justified
in
crushing
ireland
exactly
as
sumner
and
stevens
crushed
the
most
english
part
of
america
it
does
not
seem
to
occur
to
them
that
this
comparison
between
the
unionist
triumph
in
america
and
a
unionist
triumph
in
britain
is
rather
hard
upon
our
particular
sympathisers
who
did
not
triumph
when
england
exults
in
lincoln
victory
over
his
foes
she
is
exulting
in
his
victory
over
her
own
friends
if
her
diplomacy
continues
as
delicate
and
chivalrous
as
it
is
at
present
they
may
soon
be
her
only
friends
england
will
be
defending
herself
at
the
expense
of
her
only
defenders
but
however
this
may
be
it
is
as
well
to
bear
witness
to
some
of
the
elements
of
my
own
experience
and
i
can
answer
for
it
at
least
that
there
are
some
people
in
the
south
who
will
not
be
pleased
at
being
swept
into
the
rubbish
heap
of
history
as
rebels
and
ruffians
and
who
will
not
i
regret
to
say
by
any
means
enjoy
even
being
classed
with
fenians
and
sinn
feiners
now
touching
the
actual
comparison
between
the
conquest
of
the
confederacy
and
the
conquest
of
ireland
there
are
of
course
a
good
many
things
to
be
said
which
politicians
can
not
be
expected
to
understand
strange
to
say
it
is
not
certain
that
a
lost
cause
was
never
worth
winning
and
it
would
be
easy
to
argue
that
the
world
lost
very
much
indeed
when
that
particular
cause
was
lost
these
are
not
days
in
which
it
is
exactly
obvious
that
an
agricultural
society
was
more
dangerous
than
an
industrial
one
and
even
southern
slavery
had
this
one
moral
merit
that
it
was
decadent
it
has
this
one
historic
advantage
that
it
is
dead
the
northern
slavery
industrial
slavery
or
what
is
called
wage
slavery
is
not
decaying
but
increasing
and
the
end
of
it
is
not
yet
but
in
any
case
it
would
be
well
for
us
to
realise
that
the
reproach
of
resembling
the
confederacy
does
not
ring
in
all
ears
as
an
unanswerable
condemnation
it
is
scarcely
a
or
sufficient
argument
to
some
hearers
even
to
prove
that
the
english
are
as
delicate
and
philanthropic
as
sherman
still
less
that
the
irish
are
as
criminal
and
lawless
as
lee
nor
will
it
soothe
every
single
soul
on
the
american
continent
to
say
that
the
english
victory
in
ireland
will
be
followed
by
a
reconstruction
like
the
reconstruction
exhibited
in
the
film
called
birth
of
a
nation
and
indeed
there
is
a
further
inference
from
that
fine
panorama
of
the
exploits
of
the
klan
it
would
be
easy
as
i
say
to
turn
the
argument
entirely
in
favour
of
the
confederacy
it
would
be
easy
to
draw
the
moral
not
that
the
southern
irish
are
as
wrong
as
the
southern
states
but
that
the
southern
states
were
as
right
as
the
southern
irish
but
upon
the
whole
i
do
not
incline
to
accept
the
parallel
in
that
sense
any
more
than
in
the
opposite
sense
for
reasons
i
have
already
given
elsewhere
i
do
believe
that
in
the
main
abraham
lincoln
was
right
but
right
in
what
if
lincoln
was
right
he
was
right
in
guessing
that
there
was
not
really
a
northern
nation
and
a
southern
nation
but
only
one
american
nation
and
if
he
has
been
proved
right
he
has
been
proved
right
by
the
fact
that
men
in
the
south
as
well
as
the
north
do
now
feel
a
patriotism
for
that
american
nation
his
wisdom
if
it
really
was
wisdom
was
justified
not
by
his
opponents
being
conquered
but
by
their
being
converted
now
if
the
english
politicians
must
insist
on
this
parallel
they
ought
to
see
that
the
parallel
is
fatal
to
themselves
the
very
test
which
proved
lincoln
right
has
proved
them
wrong
the
very
judgment
which
may
have
justified
him
quite
unquestionably
condemns
them
we
have
again
and
again
conquered
ireland
and
have
never
come
an
inch
nearer
to
converting
ireland
we
have
had
not
one
gettysburg
but
twenty
gettysburgs
but
we
have
had
no
union
and
that
is
where
as
i
have
remarked
it
is
relevant
to
remember
that
flying
fantastic
vision
on
the
films
that
told
so
many
people
what
no
histories
have
told
them
i
heard
when
i
was
in
america
rumours
of
the
local
reappearance
of
the
klan
but
the
smallness
and
mildness
of
the
manifestation
as
compared
with
the
old
southern
or
the
new
irish
case
is
alone
a
sufficient
example
of
the
exception
that
proves
the
rule
to
approximate
to
any
resemblance
to
recent
irish
events
we
must
imagine
the
klan
riding
again
in
more
than
the
terrors
of
that
vision
wild
as
the
wind
white
as
the
moon
terrible
as
an
army
with
banners
if
there
were
really
such
a
revival
of
the
southern
action
there
would
equally
be
a
revival
of
the
southern
argument
it
would
be
clear
that
lee
was
right
and
lincoln
was
wrong
that
the
southern
states
were
national
and
were
as
indestructible
as
nations
if
the
south
were
as
rebellious
as
ireland
the
north
would
be
as
wrong
as
england
but
i
desire
a
new
english
diplomacy
that
will
exhibit
not
the
things
in
which
england
is
wrong
but
the
things
in
which
england
is
right
and
england
is
right
in
england
just
as
she
is
wrong
in
ireland
and
it
is
exactly
that
rightness
of
a
real
nation
in
itself
that
it
is
at
once
most
difficult
and
most
desirable
to
explain
to
foreigners
now
the
irishman
and
to
some
extent
the
american
has
remained
alien
to
england
largely
because
he
does
not
truly
realise
that
the
englishman
loves
england
still
less
can
he
really
imagine
why
the
englishman
loves
england
that
is
why
i
insist
on
the
stupidity
of
ignoring
and
insulting
the
opinions
of
those
few
virginians
and
other
southerners
who
really
have
some
inherited
notion
of
why
englishmen
love
england
and
even
love
it
in
something
of
the
same
fashion
themselves
politicians
who
do
not
know
the
english
spirit
when
they
see
it
at
home
can
not
of
course
be
expected
to
recognise
it
abroad
publicists
are
eloquently
praising
abraham
lincoln
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
but
fundamentally
for
that
worst
and
vilest
of
all
reasons
that
he
succeeded
none
of
them
seems
to
have
the
least
notion
of
how
to
look
for
england
in
england
and
they
would
see
something
fantastic
in
the
figure
of
a
traveller
who
found
it
elsewhere
or
anywhere
but
in
new
england
and
it
is
well
perhaps
that
they
have
not
yet
found
england
where
it
is
hidden
in
england
for
if
they
found
it
they
would
kill
it
all
i
am
concerned
to
consider
here
is
the
inevitable
failure
of
this
sort
of
propaganda
to
create
a
friendship
to
praise
lincoln
as
an
englishman
is
about
as
appropriate
as
if
we
were
praising
lincoln
as
an
english
town
we
are
talking
about
something
totally
different
and
indeed
the
whole
conversation
is
rather
like
some
such
about
some
such
word
as
in
which
one
party
should
be
talking
about
the
president
and
the
other
about
the
cathedral
it
is
like
some
wild
bewilderment
in
a
farce
with
one
man
wondering
how
a
president
could
have
a
and
the
other
wondering
how
a
church
could
have
a
and
the
moral
is
the
moral
on
which
i
would
insist
everywhere
in
this
book
that
the
remedy
is
to
be
found
in
disentangling
the
two
and
not
in
entangling
them
further
you
could
not
produce
a
democrat
of
the
logical
type
of
lincoln
merely
out
of
the
moral
materials
that
now
make
up
an
english
cathedral
town
like
that
on
which
old
tom
of
lincoln
looks
down
but
on
the
other
hand
it
is
quite
certain
that
a
hundred
abraham
lincolns
working
for
a
hundred
years
could
not
build
lincoln
cathedral
and
the
farcical
allegory
of
an
attempt
to
make
old
tom
and
old
abe
embrace
to
the
glory
of
the
illogical
language
is
but
a
symbol
of
something
that
is
always
being
attempted
and
always
attempted
in
vain
it
is
not
by
mutual
imitation
that
the
understanding
can
come
it
is
not
by
erecting
new
york
in
london
that
new
york
can
learn
the
sacred
significance
of
the
towers
of
lincoln
it
is
not
by
english
dukes
importing
the
daughters
of
american
millionaires
that
england
can
get
any
glimpse
of
the
democratic
dignity
of
american
men
i
have
the
best
of
all
reasons
for
knowing
that
a
stranger
can
be
welcomed
in
america
and
just
as
he
is
courteously
treated
in
the
country
as
a
stranger
so
he
should
always
be
careful
to
treat
it
as
a
strange
land
that
sort
of
imaginative
respect
as
for
something
different
and
even
distant
is
the
only
beginning
of
any
attachment
between
patriotic
peoples
the
english
traveller
may
carry
with
him
at
least
one
word
of
his
own
great
language
and
literature
and
whenever
he
is
inclined
to
say
of
anything
is
passing
strange
he
may
remember
that
it
was
no
inconsiderable
englishman
who
appended
to
it
the
answer
therefore
as
a
stranger
give
it
welcome
and
the
world
there
was
recently
a
highly
distinguished
gathering
to
celebrate
the
past
present
and
especially
future
triumphs
of
aviation
some
of
the
most
brilliant
men
of
the
age
such
as
wells
and
garvin
made
interesting
and
important
speeches
and
many
scientific
aviators
luminously
discussed
the
new
science
among
their
graceful
felicitations
and
grave
and
quiet
analyses
a
word
was
said
or
a
note
was
struck
which
i
myself
can
never
hear
even
in
the
most
harmless
speech
without
an
impulse
to
leap
up
and
yell
and
smash
the
decanters
and
wreck
the
long
ago
when
i
was
a
boy
i
heard
it
with
fury
and
never
since
have
i
been
able
to
understand
any
free
man
hearing
it
without
fury
i
heard
it
when
bloch
and
the
old
prophets
of
pacifism
by
panic
preached
that
war
would
become
too
horrible
for
patriots
to
endure
it
sounded
to
me
like
saying
that
an
instrument
of
torture
was
being
prepared
by
my
dentist
that
would
finally
cure
me
of
loving
my
dog
and
i
felt
it
again
when
all
these
wise
and
persons
began
to
talk
about
the
inevitable
effect
of
aviation
in
bridging
the
atlantic
and
establishing
alliance
and
affection
between
england
and
america
i
resent
the
suggestion
that
a
machine
can
make
me
bad
but
i
resent
quite
equally
the
suggestion
that
a
machine
can
make
me
good
it
might
be
the
unfortunate
fact
that
a
coolness
had
arisen
between
myself
and
fitzarlington
blenkinsop
inhabiting
the
suburban
villa
and
garden
next
to
mine
and
i
might
even
be
largely
to
blame
for
it
but
if
somebody
told
me
that
a
new
kind
of
had
just
been
invented
of
so
cunning
a
structure
that
i
should
be
forced
to
become
a
of
blenkinsop
whether
i
liked
it
or
not
i
should
be
very
much
annoyed
i
should
be
moved
to
say
that
if
that
was
the
only
way
of
cutting
my
grass
i
would
not
cut
my
grass
but
continue
to
cut
my
neighbour
or
suppose
the
difference
were
even
less
defensible
suppose
a
man
had
suffered
from
a
trifling
shindy
with
his
wife
and
suppose
somebody
told
him
that
the
introduction
of
an
entirely
new
would
compel
him
to
a
reluctant
reconciliation
with
his
wife
it
would
be
found
i
fancy
that
human
nature
abhors
that
vacuum
reasonably
spirited
human
beings
will
not
be
ordered
about
by
bicycles
and
and
a
sane
man
will
not
be
made
good
let
alone
bad
by
the
things
he
has
himself
made
i
have
occasionally
dictated
to
a
typewriter
but
i
will
not
be
dictated
to
by
a
typewriter
even
of
the
newest
and
most
complicated
mechanism
nor
have
i
ever
met
a
typewriter
however
complex
that
attempted
such
a
tyranny
yet
this
and
nothing
else
is
what
is
implied
in
all
such
talk
of
the
aeroplane
annihilating
distinctions
as
well
as
distances
and
an
international
aviation
abolishing
nationalities
this
and
nothing
else
was
really
implied
in
one
speaker
prediction
that
such
aviation
will
almost
necessitate
an
friendship
incidentally
i
may
remark
it
is
not
a
true
suggestion
even
in
the
practical
and
materialistic
sense
and
the
speaker
phrase
refuted
the
argument
he
said
that
international
relations
must
be
more
friendly
when
men
can
get
from
england
to
america
in
a
day
well
men
can
already
get
from
england
to
germany
in
a
day
and
the
result
was
a
mutual
invitation
of
which
the
formalities
lasted
for
five
years
men
could
get
from
the
coast
of
england
to
the
coast
of
france
very
quickly
through
nearly
all
the
ages
during
which
those
two
coasts
were
bristling
with
arms
against
each
other
they
could
get
there
very
quickly
when
nelson
went
down
by
that
burford
inn
to
embark
for
trafalgar
they
could
get
there
very
quickly
when
napoleon
sat
in
his
tent
in
that
camp
at
boulogne
that
filled
england
with
alarums
of
invasion
are
these
the
amiable
and
pacific
relations
which
will
unite
england
and
america
when
englishmen
can
get
to
america
in
a
day
the
shortening
of
the
distance
seems
quite
as
likely
so
far
as
that
argument
goes
to
facilitate
that
endless
guerilla
warfare
which
raged
across
the
narrow
seas
in
the
middle
ages
when
french
invaders
carried
away
the
bells
of
rye
and
the
men
of
those
flats
of
east
sussex
gloriously
pursued
and
recovered
them
i
do
not
know
whether
american
privateers
landing
at
liverpool
would
carry
away
a
few
of
the
more
elegant
factory
chimneys
as
a
substitute
for
the
superstitious
symbols
of
the
past
i
know
not
if
the
english
on
ripe
reflection
would
essay
with
any
enthusiasm
to
get
them
back
but
anyhow
it
is
anything
but
that
people
can
not
fight
each
other
because
they
are
near
to
each
other
and
if
it
were
true
there
would
never
have
been
any
such
thing
as
border
warfare
in
the
world
as
a
fact
border
warfare
has
often
been
the
one
sort
of
warfare
which
it
was
most
difficult
to
bring
under
control
and
our
own
traditional
position
in
face
of
this
new
logic
is
somewhat
disconcerting
we
have
always
supposed
ourselves
safer
because
we
were
insular
and
therefore
isolated
we
have
been
congratulating
ourselves
for
centuries
on
having
enjoyed
peace
because
we
were
cut
off
from
our
neighbours
and
now
they
are
telling
us
that
we
shall
only
enjoy
peace
when
we
are
joined
up
with
our
neighbours
we
have
pitied
the
poor
nations
with
frontiers
because
a
frontier
only
produces
fighting
and
now
we
are
trusting
to
a
frontier
as
the
only
thing
that
will
produce
friendship
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
for
a
far
deeper
and
more
spiritual
reason
a
frontier
will
not
produce
friendship
only
friendliness
produces
friendship
and
we
must
look
far
deeper
into
the
soul
of
man
for
the
thing
that
produces
friendliness
but
apart
from
this
fallacy
about
the
facts
i
feel
as
i
say
a
strong
abstract
anger
against
the
idea
or
what
some
would
call
the
ideal
if
it
were
true
that
men
could
be
taught
and
tamed
by
machines
even
if
they
were
taught
wisdom
or
tamed
to
amiability
i
should
think
it
the
most
tragic
truth
in
the
world
a
man
so
improved
would
be
in
an
exceedingly
ugly
sense
losing
his
soul
to
save
it
but
in
truth
he
can
not
be
so
completely
coerced
into
good
and
in
so
far
as
he
is
incompletely
coerced
he
is
quite
as
likely
to
be
coerced
into
evil
of
the
financial
characters
who
figure
as
philanthropists
and
philosophers
in
such
cases
it
is
strictly
true
to
say
that
their
good
is
evil
the
light
in
their
bodies
is
darkness
and
the
highest
objects
of
such
men
are
the
lowest
objects
of
ordinary
men
their
peace
is
mere
safety
their
friendship
is
mere
trade
their
international
friendship
is
mere
international
trade
the
best
we
can
say
of
that
school
of
capitalism
is
that
it
will
be
unsuccessful
it
has
every
other
vice
but
it
is
not
practical
it
has
at
least
the
impossibility
of
idealism
and
so
far
as
remoteness
can
carry
it
that
inferno
is
indeed
a
utopia
all
the
visible
manifestations
of
these
men
are
materialistic
but
at
least
their
visions
will
not
materialise
the
worst
we
suffer
but
the
best
we
shall
at
any
rate
escape
we
may
continue
to
endure
the
realities
of
cosmopolitan
capitalism
but
we
shall
be
spared
its
ideals
but
i
am
not
primarily
interested
in
the
plutocrats
whose
vision
takes
so
vulgar
a
form
i
am
interested
in
the
same
thing
when
it
takes
a
far
more
subtle
form
in
men
of
genius
and
genuine
social
enthusiasm
like
wells
it
would
be
very
unfair
to
a
man
like
wells
to
suggest
that
in
his
vision
the
englishman
and
the
american
are
to
embrace
only
in
the
sense
of
clinging
to
each
other
in
terror
he
is
a
man
who
understands
what
friendship
is
and
who
knows
how
to
enjoy
the
motley
humours
of
humanity
but
the
political
reconstruction
which
he
proposes
is
too
much
determined
by
this
old
nightmare
of
necessitarianism
he
tells
us
that
our
national
dignities
and
differences
must
be
melted
into
the
huge
mould
of
a
world
state
or
else
and
i
think
these
are
almost
his
own
words
we
shall
be
destroyed
by
the
instruments
and
machinery
we
have
ourselves
made
in
effect
men
must
abandon
patriotism
or
they
will
be
murdered
by
science
after
this
surely
no
one
can
accuse
wells
of
an
undue
tenderness
for
scientific
over
other
types
of
training
greek
may
be
a
good
thing
or
no
but
nobody
says
that
if
greek
scholarship
is
carried
past
a
certain
point
everybody
will
be
torn
in
pieces
like
orpheus
or
burned
up
like
semele
or
poisoned
like
socrates
philosophy
theology
and
logic
may
or
may
not
be
idle
academic
studies
but
nobody
supposes
that
the
study
of
philosophy
or
even
of
theology
ultimately
forces
its
students
to
manufacture
racks
and
against
their
will
or
that
even
logicians
need
be
so
alarmingly
logical
as
all
that
science
seems
to
be
the
only
branch
of
study
in
which
people
have
to
be
waved
back
from
perfection
as
from
a
pestilence
but
my
business
is
not
with
the
scientific
dangers
which
alarm
wells
but
with
the
remedy
he
proposes
for
them
or
rather
with
the
relation
of
that
remedy
to
the
foundation
and
the
future
of
america
now
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
wells
finds
his
model
in
america
the
world
state
is
to
be
the
united
states
of
the
world
he
answers
almost
all
objections
to
the
practicability
of
such
a
peace
among
states
by
pointing
out
that
the
american
states
have
such
a
peace
and
by
adding
truly
enough
that
another
turn
of
history
might
easily
have
seen
them
broken
up
by
war
the
pattern
of
the
world
state
is
to
be
found
in
the
new
world
oddly
enough
as
it
seems
to
me
he
proposes
almost
cosmic
conquests
for
the
american
constitution
while
leaving
out
the
most
successful
thing
in
that
constitution
the
point
appeared
in
answer
to
a
question
which
many
like
myself
must
have
put
in
this
matter
the
question
of
despotism
and
democracy
i
can
not
understand
any
democrat
not
seeing
the
danger
of
so
distant
and
indirect
a
system
of
government
it
is
hard
enough
anywhere
to
get
representatives
to
represent
it
is
hard
enough
to
get
a
little
town
council
to
fulfil
the
wishes
of
a
little
town
even
when
the
townsmen
meet
the
town
councillors
every
day
in
the
street
and
could
kick
them
down
the
street
if
they
liked
what
the
same
town
councillors
would
be
like
if
they
were
ruling
all
their
from
the
north
pole
or
the
new
jerusalem
is
a
vision
of
oriental
despotism
beyond
the
towering
fancies
of
tamberlane
this
difficulty
in
all
representative
government
is
felt
everywhere
and
not
least
in
america
but
i
think
that
if
there
is
one
truth
apparent
in
such
a
choice
of
evils
it
is
that
monarchy
is
at
least
better
than
oligarchy
and
that
where
we
have
to
act
on
a
large
scale
the
most
genuine
popularity
can
gather
round
a
particular
person
like
a
pope
or
a
president
of
the
united
states
or
even
a
dictator
like
caesar
or
napoleon
rather
than
round
a
more
or
less
corrupt
committee
which
can
only
be
defined
as
an
obscure
oligarchy
and
in
that
sense
any
oligarchy
is
obscure
for
people
to
continue
to
trust
men
it
is
necessary
as
a
preliminary
formality
that
people
should
have
heard
of
them
and
there
are
no
men
of
whom
everybody
has
heard
as
everybody
in
france
had
heard
of
napoleon
as
all
catholics
have
heard
of
the
pope
or
all
americans
have
heard
of
the
president
i
think
the
mass
of
ordinary
americans
do
really
elect
their
president
and
even
where
they
can
not
control
him
at
least
they
watch
him
and
in
the
long
run
they
judge
him
i
think
therefore
that
the
american
constitution
has
a
real
popular
institution
in
the
presidency
but
wells
would
appear
to
want
the
american
constitution
without
the
presidency
if
i
understand
his
words
rightly
he
seems
to
want
the
great
democracy
without
its
popular
institution
alluding
to
this
danger
that
the
world
state
might
be
a
world
tyranny
he
seems
to
take
tyranny
entirely
in
the
sense
of
autocracy
he
asks
whether
the
president
of
the
world
state
would
not
be
rather
too
tremendous
a
person
and
seems
to
suggest
in
answer
that
there
need
not
even
be
any
such
person
he
seems
to
imply
that
the
committee
controlling
the
planet
could
meet
almost
without
any
one
in
the
chair
certainly
without
any
one
on
the
throne
i
can
not
imagine
anything
more
manifestly
made
to
be
a
tyranny
than
such
an
acephalous
aristocracy
but
while
wells
decision
seems
to
me
strange
his
reason
for
it
seems
to
me
still
more
extraordinary
he
suggests
that
no
such
dictator
will
be
needed
in
his
world
state
because
will
be
no
wars
and
no
diplomacy
a
world
state
ought
doubtless
to
go
round
the
world
and
going
round
the
world
seems
to
be
a
good
training
for
arguing
in
a
circle
obviously
there
will
be
no
wars
and
no
if
something
has
the
power
to
prevent
them
and
we
can
not
deduce
that
the
something
will
not
want
any
power
it
is
rather
as
if
somebody
urging
that
the
germans
could
only
be
defeated
by
uniting
the
allied
commands
under
marshal
foch
had
said
that
after
all
it
need
not
offend
the
british
generals
because
the
french
supremacy
need
only
be
a
fiction
the
germans
being
defeated
we
should
naturally
say
that
the
german
defeat
would
only
be
a
reality
because
the
allied
command
was
not
a
fiction
so
the
universal
peace
would
only
be
a
reality
if
the
world
state
were
not
a
fiction
and
it
could
not
be
even
a
state
if
it
were
not
a
government
this
argument
amounts
to
saying
first
that
the
world
state
will
be
needed
because
it
is
strong
and
then
that
it
may
safely
be
weak
because
it
will
not
be
needed
internationalism
is
in
any
case
hostile
to
democracy
i
do
not
say
it
is
incompatible
with
it
but
any
combination
of
the
two
will
be
a
compromise
between
the
two
the
only
purely
popular
government
is
local
and
founded
on
local
knowledge
the
citizens
can
rule
the
city
because
they
know
the
city
but
it
will
always
be
an
exceptional
sort
of
citizen
who
has
or
claims
the
right
to
rule
over
ten
cities
and
these
remote
and
altogether
alien
cities
all
irishmen
may
know
roughly
the
same
sort
of
things
about
ireland
but
it
is
absurd
to
say
they
all
know
the
same
things
about
iceland
when
they
may
include
a
scholar
steeped
in
icelandic
sagas
or
a
sailor
who
has
been
to
iceland
to
make
all
politics
cosmopolitan
is
to
create
an
aristocracy
of
if
your
political
outlook
really
takes
in
the
cannibal
islands
you
depend
of
necessity
upon
a
superior
and
picked
minority
of
the
people
who
have
been
to
the
cannibal
islands
or
rather
of
the
still
smaller
and
more
select
minority
who
have
come
back
given
this
difficulty
about
quite
direct
democracy
over
large
areas
i
think
the
nearest
thing
to
democracy
is
despotism
at
any
rate
i
think
it
is
some
sort
of
more
or
less
independent
monarchy
such
as
andrew
jackson
created
in
america
and
i
believe
it
is
true
to
say
that
the
two
men
whom
the
modern
world
really
and
almost
reluctantly
regards
with
impersonal
respect
as
clothed
by
their
office
with
something
historic
and
honourable
are
the
pope
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
but
to
admire
the
united
states
as
the
united
states
is
one
thing
to
admire
them
as
the
world
state
is
quite
another
the
attempt
of
wells
to
make
america
a
sort
of
model
for
the
federation
of
all
the
free
nations
of
the
earth
though
it
is
international
in
intention
is
really
as
narrowly
national
in
the
bad
sense
as
the
desire
of
kipling
to
cover
the
world
with
british
imperialism
or
of
professor
treitschke
to
cover
it
with
prussian
not
being
schoolboys
we
no
longer
believe
that
everything
can
be
settled
by
painting
the
map
red
nor
do
i
believe
it
can
be
done
by
painting
it
blue
with
white
spots
even
if
they
are
called
stars
the
insufficiency
of
british
imperialism
does
not
lie
in
the
fact
that
it
has
always
been
applied
by
force
of
arms
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
has
not
it
has
been
effected
largely
by
commerce
by
colonisation
of
comparatively
empty
places
by
geographical
discovery
and
diplomatic
bargain
whether
it
be
regarded
as
praise
or
blame
it
is
certainly
the
truth
that
among
all
the
things
that
have
called
themselves
empires
the
british
has
been
perhaps
the
least
purely
military
and
has
least
both
of
the
special
guilt
and
the
special
glory
that
goes
with
militarism
the
insufficiency
of
british
imperialism
is
not
that
it
is
imperial
let
alone
military
the
insufficiency
of
british
imperialism
is
that
it
is
british
when
it
is
not
merely
jewish
it
is
that
just
as
a
man
is
no
more
than
a
man
so
a
nation
is
no
more
than
a
nation
and
any
nation
is
inadequate
as
an
international
model
any
state
looks
small
when
it
occupies
the
whole
earth
any
polity
is
narrow
as
soon
as
it
is
as
wide
as
the
world
it
would
be
just
the
same
if
ireland
began
to
paint
the
map
green
or
montenegro
were
to
paint
it
black
the
objection
to
spreading
anything
all
over
the
world
is
that
among
other
things
you
have
to
spread
it
very
thin
but
america
which
wells
takes
as
a
model
is
in
another
sense
rather
a
warning
wells
says
very
truly
that
there
was
a
moment
in
history
when
america
might
well
have
broken
up
into
independent
states
like
those
of
europe
he
seems
to
take
it
for
granted
that
it
was
in
all
respects
an
advantage
that
this
was
avoided
yet
there
is
surely
a
case
however
mildly
we
put
it
for
a
certain
importance
in
the
world
still
attaching
to
europe
there
are
some
who
find
france
as
interesting
as
florida
and
who
think
they
can
learn
as
much
about
history
and
humanity
in
the
marble
cities
of
the
mediterranean
as
in
the
wooden
towns
of
the
middle
west
europe
may
have
been
divided
but
it
was
certainly
not
destroyed
nor
has
its
peculiar
position
in
the
culture
of
the
world
been
destroyed
nothing
has
yet
appeared
capable
of
completely
eclipsing
it
either
in
its
extension
in
america
or
its
imitation
in
japan
but
the
immediate
point
here
is
perhaps
a
more
important
one
there
is
now
no
creed
accepted
as
embodying
the
common
sense
of
all
europe
as
the
catholic
creed
was
accepted
as
embodying
it
in
mediaeval
times
there
is
no
culture
broadly
superior
to
all
others
as
the
mediterranean
culture
was
superior
to
that
of
the
barbarians
in
roman
times
if
europe
were
united
in
modern
times
it
would
probably
be
by
the
victory
of
one
of
its
types
over
others
possibly
over
all
the
others
and
when
america
was
united
finally
in
the
nineteenth
century
it
by
the
victory
of
one
of
its
types
over
others
it
is
not
yet
certain
that
this
victory
was
a
good
thing
it
is
not
yet
certain
that
the
world
will
be
better
for
the
triumph
of
the
north
over
the
southern
traditions
of
america
it
may
yet
turn
out
to
be
as
unfortunate
as
a
triumph
of
the
north
germans
over
the
southern
traditions
of
germany
and
of
europe
the
men
who
will
not
face
this
fact
are
men
whose
minds
are
not
free
they
are
more
crushed
by
progress
than
any
pietists
by
providence
they
are
not
allowed
to
question
that
whatever
has
recently
happened
was
all
for
the
best
now
progress
is
providence
without
god
that
is
it
is
a
theory
that
everything
has
always
perpetually
gone
right
by
accident
it
is
a
sort
of
atheistic
optimism
based
on
an
everlasting
coincidence
far
more
miraculous
than
a
miracle
if
there
be
no
purpose
or
if
the
purpose
permits
of
human
free
will
then
in
either
case
it
is
almost
insanely
unlikely
that
there
should
be
in
history
a
period
of
steady
and
uninterrupted
progress
or
in
other
words
a
period
in
which
poor
bewildered
humanity
moves
amid
a
chaos
of
complications
without
making
a
single
mistake
what
has
to
be
hammered
into
the
heads
of
most
normal
is
that
man
has
made
a
great
many
mistakes
modern
man
has
made
a
great
many
mistakes
indeed
in
the
case
of
that
progressive
and
pioneering
character
one
is
sometimes
tempted
to
say
that
he
has
made
nothing
but
mistakes
calvinism
was
a
mistake
and
capitalism
was
a
mistake
and
teutonism
and
the
flattery
of
the
northern
tribes
were
mistakes
in
the
french
the
persecution
of
catholicism
by
the
politicians
was
a
mistake
as
they
found
out
in
the
great
war
when
the
memory
gave
irish
or
italian
catholics
an
excuse
for
hanging
back
in
england
the
loss
of
agriculture
and
therefore
of
in
war
and
the
power
to
stand
a
siege
was
a
mistake
and
in
america
the
introduction
of
the
negroes
was
a
mistake
but
it
may
yet
be
found
that
the
sacrifice
of
the
southern
white
man
to
them
was
even
more
of
a
mistake
the
reason
of
this
doubt
is
in
one
word
we
have
not
yet
seen
the
end
of
the
whole
industrial
experiment
and
there
are
already
signs
of
it
coming
to
a
bad
end
it
may
end
in
bolshevism
it
is
more
likely
to
end
in
the
servile
state
indeed
the
two
things
are
not
so
different
as
some
suppose
and
they
grow
less
different
every
day
the
bolshevists
have
already
called
in
capitalists
to
help
them
to
crush
the
free
peasants
the
capitalists
are
quite
likely
to
call
in
labour
leaders
to
whitewash
their
compromise
as
social
reform
or
even
socialism
the
cosmopolitan
jews
who
are
the
communists
in
the
east
will
not
find
it
so
very
hard
to
make
a
bargain
with
the
cosmopolitan
jews
who
are
capitalists
in
the
west
the
western
jews
would
be
willing
to
admit
a
nominal
socialism
the
eastern
jews
have
already
admitted
that
their
socialism
is
nominal
it
was
the
bolshevist
leader
himself
who
said
is
again
a
capitalist
country
but
whoever
makes
the
bargain
and
whatever
is
its
precise
character
the
substance
of
it
will
be
servile
it
will
be
servile
in
the
only
rational
and
reliable
sense
that
is
an
arrangement
by
which
a
mass
of
men
are
ensured
shelter
and
livelihood
in
return
for
being
subjected
to
a
law
which
obliges
them
to
continue
to
labour
of
course
it
will
not
be
called
the
servile
state
it
is
very
probable
that
it
will
be
called
the
socialist
state
but
nobody
seems
to
realise
how
very
near
all
the
industrial
countries
are
to
it
at
any
moment
it
may
appear
in
the
simple
form
of
compulsory
arbitration
for
compulsory
arbitration
dealing
with
private
employers
is
by
definition
slavery
when
workmen
receive
unemployment
pay
and
at
the
same
time
arouse
more
and
more
irritation
by
going
on
strike
it
may
seem
very
natural
to
give
them
the
unemployment
pay
for
good
and
forbid
them
the
strike
for
good
and
the
combination
of
those
two
things
is
by
definition
slavery
and
trotsky
can
beat
any
trust
magnate
as
a
for
he
does
not
even
pretend
that
his
compulsory
labour
is
a
free
bargain
if
trotsky
and
the
trust
magnate
come
to
a
working
compromise
that
compromise
will
be
a
servile
state
but
it
will
also
be
the
supreme
and
by
far
the
most
constructive
and
conclusive
result
of
the
industrial
movement
in
history
of
the
power
of
machinery
or
money
of
the
huge
populations
of
the
modern
cities
of
scientific
inventions
and
resources
of
all
the
things
before
which
the
agricultural
society
of
the
southern
confederacy
went
down
but
even
those
who
can
not
see
that
commercialism
may
end
in
the
triumph
of
slavery
can
see
that
the
northern
victory
has
to
a
great
extent
ended
in
the
triumph
of
commercialism
and
the
point
at
the
moment
is
that
this
did
definitely
mean
even
at
the
time
the
triumph
of
one
american
type
over
another
american
type
just
as
much
as
any
european
war
might
mean
the
triumph
of
one
european
type
over
another
a
victory
of
england
over
france
would
be
a
victory
of
merchants
over
peasants
and
the
victory
of
northerners
over
southerners
was
a
victory
of
merchants
over
squires
so
that
that
very
unity
which
wells
contrasts
so
favourably
with
war
was
not
only
itself
due
to
a
war
but
to
a
war
which
had
one
of
the
most
questionable
and
even
perilous
of
the
results
of
war
that
result
was
a
change
in
the
balance
of
power
the
predominance
of
a
particular
partner
the
exaltation
of
a
particular
example
the
eclipse
of
excellent
traditions
when
the
defeated
lost
their
international
influence
in
short
it
made
exactly
the
same
sort
of
difference
of
which
we
speak
when
we
say
that
was
a
disaster
to
europe
or
that
it
was
necessary
to
fight
prussia
lest
she
should
prussianise
the
whole
world
america
would
have
been
very
different
if
the
leadership
had
remained
with
virginia
the
world
would
have
been
very
different
if
america
had
been
very
different
it
is
quite
reasonable
to
rejoice
that
the
issue
went
as
it
did
indeed
as
i
have
explained
elsewhere
for
other
reasons
i
do
on
the
whole
rejoice
in
it
but
it
is
certainly
not
that
it
is
a
matter
for
rejoicing
one
type
of
american
state
conquered
and
subjugated
another
type
of
american
state
and
the
virtues
and
value
of
the
latter
were
very
largely
lost
to
the
world
so
if
wells
insists
on
the
parallel
of
a
united
states
of
europe
he
must
accept
the
parallel
of
a
civil
war
of
europe
he
must
suppose
that
the
peasant
countries
crush
the
industrial
countries
or
vice
versa
and
that
one
or
other
of
them
becomes
the
european
tradition
to
the
neglect
of
the
other
the
situation
which
seems
to
satisfy
him
so
completely
in
america
is
after
all
the
situation
which
would
result
in
europe
if
the
germanic
empires
let
us
say
had
entirely
arrested
the
special
development
of
the
slavs
or
if
the
influence
of
france
had
really
broken
off
short
under
a
blow
from
britain
the
old
south
had
qualities
of
humane
civilisation
which
have
not
sufficiently
survived
or
at
any
rate
have
not
sufficiently
spread
it
is
true
that
the
decline
of
the
agricultural
south
has
been
considerably
balanced
by
the
growth
of
the
agricultural
west
it
is
true
as
i
have
occasion
to
emphasise
in
another
place
that
the
west
does
give
the
new
america
something
that
is
nearly
a
normal
peasantry
as
a
pendant
to
the
industrial
towns
but
this
is
not
an
answer
it
is
rather
an
augmentation
of
the
argument
in
so
far
as
america
is
saved
it
is
saved
by
being
patchy
and
would
be
ruined
if
the
western
patch
had
the
same
fate
as
the
southern
patch
when
all
is
said
therefore
the
advantages
of
american
unification
are
not
so
certain
that
we
can
apply
them
to
a
world
unification
the
doubt
could
be
expressed
in
a
great
many
ways
and
by
a
great
many
examples
for
that
matter
it
is
already
being
felt
that
the
supremacy
of
the
middle
west
in
politics
is
inflicting
upon
other
localities
exactly
the
sort
of
local
injustice
that
turns
provinces
into
nations
struggling
to
be
free
it
has
already
inflicted
what
amounts
to
religious
persecution
or
the
imposition
of
an
alien
morality
on
the
civilisation
of
california
in
a
word
the
american
system
is
a
good
one
as
governments
go
but
it
is
too
large
and
the
world
will
not
be
improved
by
making
it
larger
and
for
this
reason
alone
i
should
reject
this
second
method
of
uniting
england
and
america
which
is
not
only
americanising
england
but
americanising
everything
else
but
the
essential
reason
is
that
a
type
of
culture
came
out
on
top
in
america
and
england
in
the
nineteenth
century
which
can
not
and
would
not
be
tolerated
on
top
of
the
world
to
unite
all
the
systems
at
the
top
without
improving
and
simplifying
their
social
organisation
below
would
be
to
tie
all
the
tops
of
the
trees
together
where
they
rise
above
a
dense
and
poisonous
jungle
and
make
the
jungle
darker
than
before
to
create
such
a
cosmopolitan
political
platform
would
be
to
build
a
roof
above
our
own
heads
to
shut
out
the
sunlight
on
which
only
usurers
and
conspirators
clad
in
gold
could
walk
about
in
the
sun
this
is
no
moment
when
industrial
intellectualism
can
inflict
such
an
artificial
oppression
upon
the
world
industrialism
itself
is
coming
to
see
dark
days
and
its
future
is
very
doubtful
it
is
split
from
end
to
end
with
strikes
and
struggles
for
economic
life
in
which
the
poor
not
only
plead
that
they
are
starving
but
even
the
rich
can
only
plead
that
they
are
bankrupt
the
peasantries
are
growing
not
only
more
prosperous
but
more
politically
effective
the
russian
moujik
has
held
up
the
bolshevist
government
of
moscow
and
petersburg
a
huge
concession
has
been
made
by
england
to
ireland
the
league
of
nations
has
decided
for
poland
against
prussia
it
is
not
certain
that
industrialism
will
not
wither
even
in
its
own
field
it
is
certain
that
its
intellectual
ideas
will
not
be
allowed
to
cover
every
field
and
this
sort
of
cosmopolitan
culture
is
one
of
its
ideas
industrialism
itself
may
perish
or
on
the
other
hand
industrialism
itself
may
survive
by
some
searching
and
scientific
reform
that
will
really
guarantee
economic
security
to
all
it
may
really
purge
itself
of
the
accidental
maladies
of
anarchy
and
famine
and
continue
as
a
machine
but
at
least
as
a
comparatively
clean
and
humanely
shielded
machine
at
any
rate
no
longer
as
a
machine
capitalism
may
clear
itself
of
its
worst
corruptions
by
such
reform
as
is
open
to
it
by
creating
humane
and
healthy
conditions
for
labour
and
setting
the
labouring
classes
to
work
under
a
lucid
and
recognised
law
it
may
make
pittsburg
one
vast
model
factory
for
all
who
will
model
themselves
upon
factories
and
may
give
to
all
men
and
women
in
its
employment
a
clear
social
status
in
which
they
can
be
contented
and
secure
and
on
the
day
when
that
social
security
is
established
for
the
masses
when
industrial
capitalism
has
achieved
this
larger
and
more
logical
organisation
and
found
peace
at
last
a
strange
and
shadowy
and
ironic
triumph
like
an
abstract
apology
will
surely
hover
over
all
those
graves
in
the
wilderness
where
lay
the
bones
of
so
many
gallant
gentlemen
men
who
had
also
from
their
youth
known
and
upheld
such
a
social
stratification
who
had
the
courage
to
call
a
spade
a
spade
and
a
slave
a
slave
new
martin
the
aim
of
this
book
if
it
has
one
is
to
suggest
this
thesis
that
the
very
worst
way
of
helping
friendship
is
to
be
an
there
is
only
one
thing
lower
of
course
which
is
being
an
it
is
lower
because
at
least
englishmen
do
exist
and
americans
do
exist
and
it
may
be
possible
though
repulsive
to
imagine
an
american
and
an
englishman
in
some
way
blended
together
but
if
angles
and
saxons
ever
did
exist
they
are
all
fortunately
dead
now
and
the
wildest
imagination
can
not
form
the
weakest
idea
of
what
sort
of
monster
would
be
made
by
mixing
one
with
the
other
but
my
thesis
is
that
the
whole
hope
and
the
only
hope
lies
not
in
mixing
two
things
together
but
rather
in
cutting
them
very
sharply
asunder
that
is
the
only
way
in
which
two
things
can
succeed
sufficiently
in
getting
outside
each
other
to
appreciate
and
admire
each
other
so
long
as
they
are
different
and
yet
supposed
to
be
the
same
there
can
be
nothing
but
a
divided
mind
and
a
staggering
balance
it
may
be
that
in
the
first
twilight
of
time
man
and
woman
walked
about
as
one
quadruped
but
if
they
did
i
am
sure
it
was
a
quadruped
that
reared
and
bucked
and
kicked
up
its
heels
then
the
flaming
sword
of
some
angel
divided
them
and
they
fell
in
love
with
each
other
should
the
reader
require
an
example
a
little
more
within
historical
range
or
a
little
more
subject
to
critical
tests
than
the
above
prehistoric
anecdote
which
i
need
not
say
was
revealed
to
me
in
a
vision
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
supply
them
both
in
a
hypothetical
and
a
historical
form
it
is
obvious
enough
in
a
general
way
that
if
we
begin
to
subject
diverse
countries
to
an
identical
test
there
will
not
only
be
rivalry
but
what
is
far
more
deadly
and
disastrous
superiority
if
we
institute
a
competition
between
holland
and
switzerland
as
to
the
relative
grace
and
agility
of
their
mountain
guides
it
will
be
clear
that
the
decision
is
disproportionately
easy
it
will
also
be
clear
that
certain
facts
about
the
configuration
of
holland
have
escaped
our
international
eye
if
we
establish
a
comparison
between
them
in
skill
and
industry
in
the
art
of
building
dykes
against
the
sea
it
will
be
equally
clear
that
the
injustice
falls
the
other
way
it
will
also
be
clear
that
the
situation
of
switzerland
on
the
map
has
received
insufficient
study
in
both
cases
there
will
not
only
be
rivalry
but
very
unbalanced
and
unjust
rivalry
in
both
cases
therefore
there
will
not
only
be
enmity
but
very
bitter
or
insolent
enmity
but
so
long
as
the
two
are
sharply
divided
there
can
be
no
enmity
because
there
can
be
no
rivalry
nobody
can
argue
about
whether
the
swiss
climb
mountains
better
than
the
dutch
build
dykes
just
as
nobody
can
argue
about
whether
a
triangle
is
more
triangular
than
a
circle
is
round
this
fancy
example
is
alphabetically
and
indeed
artificially
simple
but
having
used
it
for
convenience
i
could
easily
give
similar
examples
not
of
fancy
but
of
fact
i
had
occasion
recently
to
attend
the
christmas
festivity
of
a
club
in
london
for
the
exiles
of
one
of
the
scandinavian
nations
when
i
entered
the
room
the
first
thing
that
struck
my
eye
and
greatly
raised
my
spirits
was
that
the
room
was
dotted
with
the
colours
of
peasant
costumes
and
the
specimens
of
peasant
craftsmanship
there
were
of
course
other
costumes
and
other
crafts
in
evidence
there
were
men
dressed
like
myself
only
better
in
the
garb
of
the
modern
middle
classes
there
was
furniture
like
the
furniture
of
any
other
room
in
london
now
according
to
the
ideal
formula
of
the
ordinary
internationalist
these
things
that
we
had
in
common
ought
to
have
moved
me
to
a
sense
of
the
kinship
of
all
civilisation
i
ought
to
have
felt
that
as
the
scandinavian
gentleman
wore
a
collar
and
tie
and
i
also
wore
a
collar
and
tie
we
were
brothers
and
nothing
could
come
between
us
i
ought
to
have
felt
that
we
were
standing
for
the
same
principles
of
truth
because
we
were
wearing
the
same
pair
of
trousers
or
rather
to
speak
with
more
precision
similar
pairs
of
trousers
anyhow
the
pair
of
trousers
that
cloven
pennon
ought
to
have
floated
in
fancy
over
my
head
as
the
banner
of
europe
or
the
league
of
nations
i
am
constrained
to
confess
that
no
such
rush
of
emotions
overcame
me
and
the
topic
of
trousers
did
not
float
across
my
mind
at
all
so
far
as
those
things
were
concerned
i
might
have
remained
in
a
mood
of
mortal
enmity
and
cheerfully
shot
or
stabbed
the
best
dressed
gentleman
in
the
room
precisely
what
did
warm
my
heart
with
an
abrupt
affection
for
that
northern
nation
was
the
very
thing
that
is
utterly
and
indeed
lamentably
lacking
in
my
own
nation
it
was
something
corresponding
to
the
one
great
gap
in
english
history
corresponding
to
the
one
great
blot
on
english
civilisation
it
was
the
spiritual
presence
of
a
peasantry
dressed
according
to
its
own
dignity
and
expressing
itself
by
its
own
creations
the
sketch
of
america
left
by
charles
dickens
is
generally
regarded
as
something
which
is
either
to
be
used
as
a
taunt
or
covered
with
an
apology
doubtless
it
was
unduly
critical
even
of
the
america
of
that
day
yet
curiously
enough
it
may
well
be
the
text
for
a
true
reconciliation
at
the
present
day
it
is
true
that
in
this
as
in
other
things
the
dickensian
exaggeration
is
itself
exaggerated
it
is
also
true
that
while
it
is
it
is
not
allowed
for
dickens
tended
too
much
to
describe
the
united
states
as
a
vast
lunatic
asylum
but
partly
because
he
had
a
natural
inspiration
and
imagination
suited
to
the
description
of
lunatic
asylums
as
it
was
his
finest
poetic
fancy
that
created
a
lunatic
over
the
garden
wall
so
it
was
his
fancy
that
created
a
lunatic
over
the
western
sea
to
read
some
of
the
complaints
one
would
fancy
that
dickens
had
deliberately
invented
a
low
and
farcical
america
to
be
a
contrast
to
his
high
and
exalted
england
it
is
suggested
that
he
showed
america
as
full
of
rowdy
bullies
like
hannibal
chollop
or
ridiculous
like
elijah
pogram
while
england
was
full
of
refined
and
sincere
spirits
like
jonas
chuzzlewit
chevy
slime
montague
tigg
and
pecksniff
if
makes
america
a
lunatic
asylum
what
in
the
world
does
it
make
england
we
can
only
say
a
criminal
lunatic
asylum
the
truth
is
of
course
that
dickens
so
described
them
because
he
had
a
genius
for
that
sort
of
description
for
the
making
of
almost
maniacal
grotesques
of
the
same
type
as
quilp
or
fagin
he
made
these
americans
absurd
because
he
was
an
artist
in
absurdity
and
no
artist
can
help
finding
hints
everywhere
for
his
own
peculiar
art
in
a
word
he
created
a
laughable
pogram
for
the
same
reason
that
he
created
a
laughable
pecksniff
and
that
was
only
because
no
other
creature
could
have
created
them
it
is
often
said
that
we
learn
to
love
the
characters
in
romances
as
if
they
were
characters
in
real
life
i
wish
we
could
sometimes
love
the
characters
in
real
life
as
we
love
the
characters
in
romances
there
are
a
great
many
human
souls
whom
we
should
accept
more
kindly
and
even
appreciate
more
clearly
if
we
simply
thought
of
them
as
people
in
a
story
is
itself
indeed
an
unsatisfactory
and
even
unfortunate
example
for
it
is
among
its
author
other
works
a
rather
unusually
harsh
and
hostile
story
i
do
not
suggest
that
we
should
feel
towards
an
american
friend
that
exact
shade
or
tint
of
tenderness
that
we
feel
towards
hannibal
chollop
our
enjoyment
of
the
foreigner
should
rather
resemble
our
enjoyment
of
pickwick
than
our
enjoyment
of
pecksniff
but
there
is
this
amount
of
appropriateness
even
in
the
particular
example
that
dickens
did
show
in
both
countries
how
men
can
be
made
amusing
to
each
other
so
far
the
point
is
not
that
he
made
fun
of
america
but
that
he
got
fun
out
of
america
and
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
he
applied
exactly
the
same
method
of
selection
and
exaggeration
to
england
in
the
other
english
stories
written
in
a
more
amiable
mood
he
applied
it
in
a
more
amiable
manner
but
he
could
apply
it
to
an
american
too
when
he
was
writing
in
that
mood
and
manner
we
can
see
it
in
the
witty
and
withering
criticism
delivered
by
the
yankee
traveller
in
the
musty
refreshment
room
of
mugby
junction
a
genuine
example
of
a
genuinely
american
fun
and
freedom
satirising
a
genuinely
british
stuffiness
and
snobbery
nobody
expects
the
american
traveller
to
admire
the
refreshments
at
mugby
junction
but
he
might
admire
the
refreshment
at
one
of
the
pickwickian
inns
especially
if
it
contained
pickwick
nobody
expects
pickwick
to
like
pogram
but
he
might
like
the
american
who
made
fun
of
mugby
junction
but
the
point
is
that
while
he
supported
him
in
making
fun
he
would
also
think
him
funny
the
two
comic
characters
could
admire
each
other
but
they
would
also
be
amused
at
each
other
and
the
american
would
think
the
englishman
funny
because
he
was
english
and
a
very
good
reason
too
the
englishman
would
think
the
american
amusing
because
he
was
american
nor
can
i
imagine
a
better
ground
for
his
amusement
now
many
will
debate
on
the
psychological
possibility
of
such
a
friendship
founded
on
reciprocal
ridicule
or
rather
on
a
comedy
of
comparisons
but
i
will
say
of
this
harmony
of
humours
what
wells
says
of
his
harmony
of
states
in
the
unity
of
his
world
state
if
it
be
truly
impossible
to
have
such
a
peace
then
there
is
nothing
possible
except
war
if
we
can
not
have
friends
in
this
fashion
then
we
shall
sooner
or
later
have
enemies
in
some
other
fashion
there
is
no
hope
in
the
pompous
impersonalities
of
internationalism
and
this
brings
us
to
the
real
and
relevant
mistake
of
dickens
it
was
not
in
thinking
his
americans
funny
but
in
thinking
them
foolish
because
they
were
funny
in
this
sense
it
will
be
noticed
that
american
sketches
are
almost
avowedly
superficial
they
are
descriptions
of
public
life
and
not
private
life
jefferson
brick
had
no
private
life
but
jonas
chuzzlewit
undoubtedly
had
a
private
life
and
even
kept
some
parts
of
it
exceeding
private
pecksniff
was
also
a
domestic
character
so
was
quilp
pecksniff
and
quilp
had
slightly
different
ways
of
surprising
their
families
pecksniff
by
playfully
observing
when
he
came
home
quilp
by
coming
home
at
all
but
we
can
form
no
picture
of
how
hannibal
chollop
playfully
surprised
his
family
possibly
by
shooting
at
them
possibly
by
not
shooting
at
them
we
can
only
say
that
he
would
rather
surprise
us
by
having
a
family
at
all
we
do
not
know
how
the
mother
of
the
modern
gracchi
managed
the
modern
gracchi
for
her
maternity
was
rather
a
public
than
a
private
office
we
have
no
romantic
moonlit
scenes
of
the
of
elijah
pogram
to
balance
against
the
love
story
of
seth
pecksniff
these
figures
are
all
in
a
special
sense
theatrical
all
facing
one
way
and
lit
up
by
a
public
limelight
their
ridiculous
characters
are
detachable
from
their
real
characters
if
they
have
any
real
characters
and
the
author
might
perfectly
well
be
right
about
what
is
ridiculous
and
wrong
about
what
is
real
he
might
be
as
right
in
smiling
at
the
pograms
and
the
bricks
as
in
smiling
at
the
pickwicks
and
the
boffins
and
he
might
still
be
as
wrong
in
seeing
pogram
as
a
hypocrite
as
the
great
buzfuz
was
wrong
in
seeing
pickwick
as
a
monster
of
revolting
heartlessness
and
systematic
villainy
he
might
still
be
as
wrong
in
thinking
jefferson
brick
a
charlatan
and
a
cheat
as
was
that
great
disciple
of
lavater
wilfer
in
tracing
every
wrinkle
of
evil
cunning
in
the
face
of
boffin
for
spectacles
and
gaiters
and
boffin
bonnets
and
boudoir
are
after
all
superficial
jokes
and
might
be
equally
well
seen
whatever
we
saw
beneath
them
a
man
may
smile
and
smile
and
be
a
villain
but
a
man
may
also
make
us
smile
and
not
be
a
villain
he
may
make
us
smile
and
not
even
be
a
fool
he
may
make
us
roar
with
laughter
and
be
an
exceedingly
wise
man
now
that
is
the
paradox
of
america
which
dickens
never
discovered
elijah
pogram
was
far
more
fantastic
than
his
satirist
thought
and
the
most
grotesque
feature
of
brick
and
chollop
was
hidden
from
him
the
really
strange
thing
was
that
pogram
probably
did
say
he
may
be
so
air
our
bars
wild
he
may
be
so
air
our
buffalers
and
yet
was
a
perfectly
intelligent
and
citizen
while
he
said
it
the
extraordinary
thing
is
that
jefferson
brick
may
really
have
said
libation
of
freedom
must
sometimes
be
quaffed
in
blood
and
yet
jefferson
brick
may
have
served
freedom
resisting
unto
blood
there
really
has
been
a
florid
school
of
rhetoric
in
the
united
states
which
has
made
it
quite
possible
for
serious
and
sensible
men
to
say
such
things
it
is
amusing
simply
as
a
difference
of
idiom
or
costume
is
always
amusing
just
as
english
idiom
and
english
costume
are
amusing
to
americans
but
about
this
kind
of
difference
there
can
be
no
kind
of
doubt
so
sturdy
not
to
say
stuffy
a
materialist
as
ingersoll
could
say
of
so
shoddy
not
to
say
shady
a
financial
politician
as
blaine
an
armÃ©d
warrior
like
a
plumÃ©d
knight
james
blaine
strode
down
the
hall
of
congress
and
flung
his
spear
full
and
true
at
the
shield
of
every
enemy
of
his
country
and
every
traducer
of
his
fair
name
compared
with
that
the
passage
about
bears
and
buffaloes
which
pogram
delivered
in
defence
of
the
defaulting
is
really
a
very
reasonable
and
appropriate
statement
for
bears
and
buffaloes
are
wild
and
rough
and
in
that
sense
free
while
plumÃ©d
knights
do
not
throw
their
lances
about
like
the
assegais
of
zulus
and
the
defaulting
was
at
least
as
good
a
person
to
praise
in
such
a
fashion
as
james
blaine
of
the
little
rock
railway
but
anybody
who
had
treated
ingersoll
or
blaine
merely
as
a
fool
and
a
figure
of
fun
would
have
very
rapidly
found
out
his
mistake
but
dickens
did
not
know
brick
or
chollop
long
enough
to
find
out
his
mistake
it
need
not
be
denied
that
even
after
a
full
understanding
he
might
still
have
found
things
to
smile
at
or
to
criticise
i
do
not
insist
on
his
admitting
that
hannibal
chollop
was
as
great
a
hero
as
hannibal
or
that
elijah
pogram
was
as
true
a
prophet
as
elijah
but
i
do
say
very
seriously
that
they
had
something
about
their
atmosphere
and
situation
that
made
possible
a
sort
of
heroism
and
even
a
sort
of
prophecy
that
were
really
less
natural
at
that
period
in
that
merry
england
whose
comedy
and
common
sense
we
sum
up
under
the
name
of
dickens
when
we
joke
about
the
name
of
hannibal
chollop
we
might
remember
of
what
nation
was
the
general
who
dismissed
his
defeated
soldiers
at
appomatox
with
words
which
the
historian
has
justly
declared
to
be
worthy
of
hannibal
have
fought
through
this
war
together
i
have
done
my
best
for
you
it
is
not
fair
to
forget
jefferson
or
even
jefferson
davis
entirely
in
favour
of
jefferson
brick
for
all
these
three
things
good
bad
and
indifferent
go
together
to
form
something
that
dickens
missed
merely
because
the
england
of
his
time
most
disastrously
missed
it
in
this
case
as
in
every
case
the
only
way
to
measure
justly
the
excess
of
a
foreign
country
is
to
measure
the
defect
of
our
own
country
for
in
this
matter
the
human
mind
is
the
victim
of
a
curious
little
unconscious
trick
the
cause
of
nearly
all
international
dislikes
a
man
treats
his
own
faults
as
original
sin
and
supposes
them
scattered
everywhere
with
the
seed
of
adam
he
supposes
that
men
have
then
added
their
own
foreign
vices
to
the
solid
and
simple
foundation
of
his
own
private
vices
it
would
astound
him
to
realise
that
they
have
actually
by
their
strange
erratic
path
avoided
his
vices
as
well
as
his
virtues
his
own
faults
are
things
with
which
he
is
so
much
at
home
that
he
at
once
forgets
and
assumes
them
abroad
he
is
so
faintly
conscious
of
them
in
himself
that
he
is
not
even
conscious
of
the
absence
of
them
in
other
people
he
assumes
that
they
are
there
so
that
he
does
not
see
that
they
are
not
there
the
englishman
takes
it
for
granted
that
a
frenchman
will
have
all
the
english
faults
then
he
goes
on
to
be
seriously
angry
with
the
frenchman
for
having
dared
to
complicate
them
by
the
french
faults
the
notion
that
the
frenchman
has
the
french
faults
and
the
english
faults
is
a
paradox
too
wild
to
cross
his
mind
he
is
like
an
old
chinaman
who
should
laugh
at
europeans
for
wearing
ludicrous
and
curling
up
their
inside
them
because
obviously
all
men
have
as
all
monkeys
have
tails
or
he
is
like
an
old
chinese
lady
who
should
justly
deride
the
shoes
of
the
west
considering
them
a
needless
addition
to
the
sufficiently
tight
and
secure
bandaging
of
the
foot
for
of
course
all
women
bind
up
their
feet
as
all
women
bind
up
their
hair
what
these
celestial
thinkers
would
not
think
of
or
allow
for
is
the
wild
possibility
that
we
do
not
have
although
we
do
have
or
that
our
ladies
are
not
silly
enough
to
have
chinese
feet
though
they
are
silly
enough
to
have
shoes
nor
should
we
necessarily
have
come
an
inch
nearer
to
the
chinese
extravagances
even
if
the
hat
rose
higher
than
a
factory
chimney
or
the
high
heels
had
evolved
into
a
sort
of
stilts
by
the
same
fallacy
the
englishman
will
not
only
curse
the
french
peasant
as
a
miser
but
will
also
try
to
tip
him
as
a
beggar
that
is
he
will
first
complain
of
the
man
having
the
surliness
of
an
independent
man
and
then
accuse
him
of
having
the
servility
of
a
dependent
one
just
as
the
hypothetical
chinaman
can
not
believe
that
we
have
but
not
so
the
englishman
can
not
believe
that
peasants
are
not
snobs
even
when
they
are
savages
or
he
sees
that
a
paris
paper
is
violent
and
sensational
and
then
supposes
that
some
millionaire
owns
twenty
such
papers
and
runs
them
as
a
newspaper
trust
surely
the
yellow
press
is
present
everywhere
to
paint
the
map
yellow
as
the
british
empire
to
paint
it
red
it
never
occurs
to
such
a
critic
that
the
french
paper
is
violent
because
it
is
personal
and
personal
because
it
belongs
to
a
real
and
responsible
person
and
not
to
a
ring
of
nameless
millionaires
it
is
a
pamphlet
and
not
an
anonymous
pamphlet
in
a
hundred
other
cases
the
same
truth
could
be
illustrated
the
situation
in
which
the
black
man
first
assumes
that
all
mankind
is
black
and
then
accuses
the
rest
of
the
artificial
vice
of
painting
their
faces
red
and
yellow
or
the
hypocrisy
of
themselves
after
the
fashion
of
whited
sepulchres
the
particular
case
of
it
now
before
us
is
that
of
the
english
misunderstanding
of
america
and
it
is
based
as
in
all
these
cases
on
the
english
misunderstanding
of
england
for
the
truth
is
that
england
has
suffered
of
late
from
not
having
enough
of
the
free
shooting
of
hannibal
chollop
from
not
understanding
enough
that
the
libation
of
freedom
must
sometimes
be
quaffed
in
blood
the
prosperous
englishman
will
not
admit
this
but
then
the
prosperous
englishman
will
not
admit
that
he
has
suffered
from
anything
that
is
what
he
is
suffering
from
until
lately
at
least
he
refused
to
realise
that
many
of
his
modern
habits
had
been
bad
habits
the
worst
of
them
being
contentment
for
all
the
real
virtue
in
contentment
evaporates
when
the
contentment
is
only
satisfaction
and
the
satisfaction
is
only
now
it
is
perfectly
true
that
america
and
not
england
has
seen
the
most
obvious
and
outrageous
official
denials
of
liberty
but
it
is
equally
true
that
it
has
seen
the
most
obvious
flouting
of
such
official
nonsense
far
more
obvious
than
any
similar
evasions
in
england
and
nobody
who
knows
the
subconscious
violence
of
the
american
character
would
ever
be
surprised
if
the
weapons
of
chollop
began
to
be
used
in
that
most
lawful
lawlessness
it
is
perfectly
true
that
the
libation
of
freedom
must
sometimes
be
drunk
in
blood
and
never
more
one
would
think
than
when
mad
millionaires
forbid
it
to
be
drunk
in
beer
but
america
as
compared
with
england
is
the
country
where
one
can
still
fancy
men
obtaining
the
libation
of
beer
by
the
libation
of
blood
vulgar
plutocracy
is
almost
omnipotent
in
both
countries
but
i
think
there
is
now
more
kick
of
reaction
against
it
in
america
than
in
england
the
americans
may
go
mad
when
they
make
laws
but
they
recover
their
reason
when
they
disobey
them
i
wish
i
could
believe
that
there
was
as
much
of
that
destructive
repentance
in
england
as
indeed
there
certainly
was
when
cobbett
wrote
it
faded
gradually
like
a
dying
fire
through
the
victorian
era
and
it
was
one
of
the
very
few
realities
that
dickens
did
not
understand
but
any
one
who
does
understand
it
will
know
that
the
days
of
cobbett
saw
the
last
lost
fight
for
english
democracy
and
that
if
he
had
stood
at
that
turning
of
the
historic
road
he
would
have
wished
a
better
fate
to
the
and
the
fury
against
the
first
machinery
and
luck
to
the
luddite
fires
anyhow
what
is
wanted
is
a
new
martin
chuzzlewit
told
by
a
wiser
mark
tapley
it
is
typical
of
something
sombre
and
occasionally
stale
in
the
mood
of
dickens
when
he
wrote
that
book
that
the
comic
servant
is
not
really
very
comic
mark
tapley
is
a
very
thin
shadow
of
sam
weller
but
if
dickens
had
written
it
in
a
happier
mood
there
might
have
been
a
truer
meaning
in
mark
tapley
happiness
for
it
is
true
that
this
illogical
good
humour
amid
unreason
and
disorder
is
one
of
the
real
virtues
of
the
english
people
it
is
the
real
advantage
they
have
in
that
adventure
all
over
the
world
which
they
were
recently
and
reluctantly
induced
to
call
an
empire
that
receptive
ridicule
remains
with
them
as
a
secret
pleasure
when
they
are
colonists
or
convicts
dickens
might
have
written
another
version
of
the
great
romance
and
one
in
which
america
was
really
seen
gaily
by
mark
instead
of
gloomily
by
martin
mark
tapley
might
really
have
made
the
best
of
america
then
america
would
have
lived
and
danced
before
us
like
pickwick
england
a
fairyland
of
happy
lunatics
and
lovable
monsters
and
we
might
still
have
sympathised
as
much
with
the
rhetoric
of
lafayette
kettle
as
with
the
rhetoric
of
wilkins
micawber
or
with
the
violence
of
chollop
as
with
the
violence
of
boythorn
that
new
martin
chuzzlewit
will
never
be
written
and
the
loss
of
it
is
more
tragic
than
the
loss
of
but
every
man
who
has
travelled
in
america
has
seen
glimpses
and
episodes
in
that
untold
tale
and
far
away
on
the
frontiers
or
in
the
hamlets
in
the
hills
of
pennsylvania
there
are
people
whom
i
met
for
a
few
hours
or
for
a
few
moments
whom
i
none
the
less
sincerely
like
and
respect
because
i
can
not
but
smile
as
i
think
of
them
but
the
converse
is
also
true
they
have
probably
forgotten
me
but
if
they
remember
they
laugh
spirit
of
i
suggest
that
diplomatists
of
the
internationalist
school
should
spend
some
of
their
money
on
staging
farces
and
comedies
of
founded
on
the
curious
and
prevalent
idea
that
england
and
america
have
the
same
language
i
know
of
course
that
we
both
inherit
the
glorious
tongue
of
shakespeare
not
to
mention
the
tune
of
the
musical
glasses
but
there
have
been
moments
when
i
thought
that
if
we
spoke
greek
and
they
spoke
latin
we
might
understand
each
other
better
for
greek
and
latin
are
at
least
fixed
while
american
at
least
is
still
very
fluid
i
do
not
know
the
american
language
and
therefore
i
do
not
claim
to
distinguish
between
the
american
language
and
the
american
slang
but
i
know
that
highly
theatrical
developments
might
follow
on
taking
the
words
as
part
of
the
english
slang
or
the
english
language
i
have
already
given
the
example
of
calling
a
person
regular
guy
which
in
the
states
is
a
graceful
expression
of
respect
and
esteem
but
which
on
the
stage
properly
handled
might
surely
lead
the
way
towards
a
divorce
or
duel
or
something
lively
sometimes
coincidence
merely
clinches
a
mistake
as
it
so
often
clinches
a
misprint
every
knows
that
the
worst
misprint
is
not
that
which
makes
nonsense
but
that
which
makes
sense
not
that
which
is
obviously
wrong
but
that
which
is
hideously
right
he
who
has
essayed
to
write
got
the
book
and
has
found
it
rendered
mysteriously
as
got
the
boob
is
pensively
resigned
it
is
when
it
is
rendered
quite
lucidly
as
got
the
that
he
is
moved
to
a
more
passionate
mood
of
regret
i
have
had
conversations
in
which
this
sort
of
accident
would
have
wholly
misled
me
if
another
accident
had
not
come
to
the
rescue
an
american
friend
of
mine
was
telling
me
of
his
adventures
as
a
down
in
the
where
real
red
indians
were
procurable
he
said
that
certain
indians
were
bad
actors
it
passed
for
me
as
a
very
ordinary
remark
on
a
very
ordinary
or
natural
deficiency
it
would
hardly
seem
a
crushing
criticism
to
say
that
some
wild
arab
chieftain
was
not
very
good
at
imitating
a
farmyard
or
that
the
grand
llama
of
thibet
was
rather
clumsy
at
making
paper
boats
but
the
remark
might
be
natural
in
a
man
travelling
in
paper
boats
or
touring
with
an
invisible
farmyard
for
his
menagerie
as
my
friend
was
a
i
supposed
he
meant
that
the
indians
were
bad
cinema
actors
but
the
phrase
has
really
a
high
and
austere
moral
meaning
which
my
levity
had
wholly
missed
a
bad
actor
means
a
man
whose
actions
are
bad
or
morally
reprehensible
so
that
i
might
have
embraced
a
red
indian
who
was
dripping
with
gore
or
covered
with
atrocious
crimes
imagining
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
him
beyond
a
mistaken
choice
of
the
theatrical
profession
surely
there
are
here
the
elements
of
a
play
not
to
mention
a
cinema
play
surely
a
new
england
village
maiden
might
find
herself
among
the
wigwams
in
the
power
of
the
formidable
and
fiendish
blue
bison
merely
through
her
mistaken
sympathy
with
his
financial
failure
as
a
film
star
the
notion
gives
me
glimpses
of
all
sorts
of
dissolving
views
of
primeval
forests
and
flamboyant
theatres
but
this
impulse
of
irrelevant
theatrical
production
must
be
curbed
there
is
one
example
however
of
this
complication
of
language
actually
used
in
contrary
senses
about
which
the
same
figure
can
be
used
to
illustrate
a
more
serious
fact
suppose
that
in
such
an
international
interlude
an
english
girl
and
an
american
girl
are
talking
about
the
fiancÃ©
of
the
former
who
is
coming
to
call
the
english
girl
will
be
haughty
and
aristocratic
on
the
stage
the
american
girl
will
of
course
have
short
hair
and
skirts
and
will
be
cynical
americans
being
more
completely
free
from
cynicism
than
any
people
in
the
world
it
is
the
great
glory
of
americans
that
they
are
not
cynical
for
that
matter
english
aristocrats
are
hardly
ever
haughty
they
understand
the
game
much
better
than
that
but
on
the
stage
anyhow
the
american
girl
may
say
referring
to
her
fiancÃ©
with
a
cynical
wave
of
the
cigarette
suppose
he
bound
to
come
and
see
you
and
at
this
the
blue
blood
of
the
vere
de
veres
will
boil
over
the
english
lady
will
be
deeply
wounded
and
insulted
at
the
suggestion
that
her
lover
only
comes
to
see
her
because
he
is
forced
to
do
so
a
staggering
stage
quarrel
will
then
ensue
and
things
will
go
from
bad
to
worse
until
the
arrival
of
an
interpreter
who
can
talk
both
english
and
american
he
stands
between
the
two
ladies
waving
two
pocket
dictionaries
and
explains
the
error
on
which
the
quarrel
turns
it
is
very
simple
like
the
seed
of
all
tragedies
in
english
is
bound
to
come
and
see
you
means
that
he
is
obliged
or
constrained
to
come
and
see
you
in
american
it
does
not
in
american
it
means
that
he
is
bent
on
coming
to
see
you
that
he
is
irrevocably
resolved
to
do
so
and
will
surmount
any
obstacle
to
do
it
the
two
young
ladies
will
then
embrace
as
the
curtain
falls
now
when
i
was
lecturing
in
america
i
was
often
told
in
a
radiant
and
congratulatory
manner
that
such
and
such
a
person
was
bound
to
come
and
hear
me
lecture
it
seemed
a
very
cruel
form
of
conscription
and
i
could
not
understand
what
authority
could
have
made
it
compulsory
in
the
course
of
discovering
my
error
however
i
thought
i
began
to
understand
certain
american
ideas
and
instincts
that
lie
behind
this
american
idiom
for
as
i
have
urged
before
and
shall
often
urge
again
the
road
to
international
friendship
is
through
really
understanding
jokes
it
is
in
a
sense
through
taking
jokes
seriously
it
is
quite
legitimate
to
laugh
at
a
man
who
walks
down
the
street
in
three
white
hats
and
a
green
dressing
gown
because
it
is
unfamiliar
but
after
all
the
man
has
reason
for
what
he
does
and
until
we
know
the
reason
we
do
not
understand
the
story
or
even
understand
the
joke
so
the
outlander
will
always
seem
outlandish
in
custom
or
costume
but
serious
relations
depend
on
our
getting
beyond
the
fact
of
difference
to
the
things
wherein
it
differs
a
good
symbolical
figure
for
all
this
may
be
found
among
the
people
who
say
perhaps
with
a
simplicity
that
they
are
bound
to
go
to
a
lecture
if
i
were
asked
for
a
single
symbolic
figure
summing
up
the
whole
of
what
seems
eccentric
and
interesting
about
america
to
an
englishman
i
should
be
satisfied
to
select
that
one
lady
who
complained
of
asquith
lecture
and
wanted
her
money
back
i
do
not
mean
that
she
was
typically
american
in
complaining
far
from
it
i
for
one
have
a
great
and
guilty
knowledge
of
all
that
amiable
american
audiences
will
endure
without
complaint
i
do
not
mean
that
she
was
typically
american
in
wanting
her
money
quite
the
contrary
that
sort
of
american
spends
money
rather
than
hoards
it
and
when
we
convict
them
of
vulgarity
we
acquit
them
of
avarice
where
she
was
typically
american
summing
up
a
truth
individual
and
indescribable
in
any
other
way
is
that
she
used
these
words
risen
from
a
to
come
and
hear
her
and
i
want
my
money
back
the
element
in
that
which
really
amuses
an
englishman
is
precisely
the
element
which
properly
analysed
ought
to
make
him
admire
an
american
but
my
point
is
that
only
by
going
through
the
amusement
can
he
reach
the
admiration
the
amusement
is
in
the
vision
of
a
tragic
sacrifice
for
what
is
avowedly
a
rather
trivial
object
asquith
is
a
candid
lady
of
considerable
humour
and
i
feel
sure
she
does
not
regard
the
experience
of
hearing
her
read
her
diary
as
an
ecstasy
for
which
the
sick
should
thus
suffer
martyrdom
she
also
is
english
and
had
no
other
claim
but
to
amuse
americans
and
possibly
to
be
amused
by
them
this
being
so
it
is
rather
as
if
somebody
said
have
risked
my
life
in
fire
and
pestilence
to
find
my
way
to
the
music
hall
or
have
fasted
forty
days
in
the
wilderness
sustained
by
the
hope
of
seeing
totty
toddles
do
her
new
dance
and
there
is
something
rather
more
subtle
involved
here
there
is
something
in
an
englishman
which
would
make
him
feel
faintly
ashamed
of
saying
that
he
had
fasted
to
hear
totty
toddles
or
risen
from
a
to
hear
asquith
he
would
feel
that
it
was
undignified
to
confess
that
he
had
wanted
mere
amusement
so
much
and
perhaps
that
he
had
wanted
anything
so
much
he
would
not
like
so
to
speak
to
be
seen
rushing
down
the
street
after
totty
toddles
or
after
asquith
or
perhaps
after
anybody
but
there
is
something
in
it
distinct
from
a
mere
embarrassment
at
admitting
enthusiasm
he
might
admit
the
enthusiasm
if
the
object
seemed
to
justify
it
he
might
perfectly
well
be
serious
about
a
serious
thing
but
he
can
not
understand
a
person
being
proud
of
serious
sacrifices
for
what
is
not
a
serious
thing
he
does
not
like
to
admit
that
a
little
thing
can
excite
him
that
he
can
lose
his
breath
in
running
or
lose
his
balance
in
reaching
after
something
that
might
be
called
silly
now
that
is
where
the
american
is
fundamentally
different
to
him
the
enthusiasm
itself
is
meritorious
to
him
the
excitement
itself
is
dignified
he
counts
it
a
part
of
his
manhood
to
fast
or
fight
or
rise
from
a
bed
of
sickness
for
something
or
possibly
for
anything
his
ideal
is
not
to
be
a
lock
that
only
a
worthy
key
can
open
but
a
wire
that
anything
can
touch
or
anybody
can
use
in
a
word
there
is
a
difference
in
the
very
definition
of
virility
and
therefore
of
virtue
a
live
wire
is
not
only
active
it
is
also
sensitive
thus
sensibility
becomes
actually
a
part
of
virility
something
more
is
involved
than
the
vulgar
simplification
of
the
american
as
the
irresistible
force
and
the
englishman
as
the
immovable
post
as
a
fact
those
who
speak
of
such
things
nowadays
generally
mean
by
something
irresistible
something
simply
immovable
or
at
least
something
unalterable
motionless
even
in
motion
like
a
cannon
ball
for
a
cannon
ball
is
as
dead
as
a
cannon
prussian
militarism
was
praised
in
that
way
until
it
met
a
french
force
of
about
half
its
size
on
the
banks
of
the
marne
but
that
is
not
what
an
american
means
by
energy
that
sort
of
prussian
energy
is
only
monotony
without
repose
american
energy
is
not
a
soulless
machine
for
it
is
the
whole
point
that
he
puts
his
soul
into
it
it
is
a
very
small
box
for
so
big
a
thing
but
it
is
not
an
empty
box
but
the
point
is
that
he
is
not
only
proud
of
his
energy
he
is
proud
of
his
excitement
he
is
not
ashamed
of
his
emotion
of
the
fire
or
even
the
tear
in
his
manly
eye
when
he
tells
you
that
the
great
wheel
of
his
machine
breaks
four
billion
butterflies
an
hour
that
is
the
point
about
american
sport
that
it
is
not
in
the
least
sportive
it
is
because
it
is
not
very
sportive
that
we
sometimes
say
it
is
not
very
sporting
it
has
the
vices
of
a
religion
it
has
all
the
paradox
of
original
sin
in
the
service
of
aboriginal
faith
it
is
sometimes
untruthful
because
it
is
sincere
it
is
sometimes
treacherous
because
it
is
loyal
men
lie
and
cheat
for
it
as
they
lied
for
their
lords
in
a
feudal
conspiracy
or
cheated
for
their
chieftains
in
a
highland
feud
we
may
say
that
the
vassal
readily
committed
treason
but
it
is
equally
true
that
he
readily
endured
torture
so
does
the
american
athlete
endure
torture
not
only
the
but
the
solemnity
of
the
american
athlete
is
like
that
of
the
american
indian
the
athletes
in
the
states
have
the
attitude
of
the
athletes
among
the
spartans
the
great
historical
nation
without
a
sense
of
humour
they
suffer
an
ascetic
rÃ©gime
not
to
be
matched
in
any
monasticism
and
hardly
in
any
militarism
if
any
tradition
of
these
things
remains
in
a
saner
age
they
will
probably
be
remembered
as
a
mysterious
religious
order
of
fakirs
or
dancing
dervishes
who
shaved
their
heads
and
fasted
in
honour
of
hercules
or
castor
and
pollux
and
that
is
really
the
spiritual
atmosphere
though
the
gods
have
vanished
and
the
religion
is
subconscious
and
therefore
irrational
for
the
problem
of
the
modern
world
is
that
it
has
continued
to
be
religious
when
it
has
ceased
to
be
rational
americans
really
would
starve
to
win
a
shy
they
would
fast
or
bleed
to
win
a
race
of
paper
boats
on
a
pond
they
would
rise
from
a
to
listen
to
asquith
but
it
is
the
real
reason
that
interests
me
here
it
is
certainly
not
that
americans
are
so
stupid
as
not
to
know
that
are
only
and
paper
boats
only
made
of
paper
americans
are
on
an
average
rather
more
intelligent
than
englishmen
and
they
are
well
aware
that
hercules
is
a
myth
and
that
asquith
is
something
of
a
mythologist
it
is
not
that
they
do
not
know
that
the
object
is
small
in
itself
it
is
that
they
do
really
believe
that
the
enthusiasm
is
great
in
itself
they
admire
people
for
being
impressionable
they
admire
people
for
being
excited
an
american
so
struggling
for
some
disproportionate
trifle
like
one
of
my
lectures
really
feels
in
a
mystical
way
that
he
is
right
because
it
is
his
whole
morality
to
be
keen
so
long
as
he
wants
something
very
much
whatever
it
is
he
feels
he
has
his
conscience
behind
him
and
the
common
sentiment
of
society
behind
him
and
god
and
the
whole
universe
behind
him
wedged
on
one
leg
in
a
hot
crowd
at
a
trivial
lecture
he
has
his
dignity
is
at
rest
that
is
what
he
means
when
he
says
he
is
bound
to
come
to
the
lecture
now
the
englishman
is
fond
of
occasional
larks
but
these
things
are
not
larks
nor
are
they
occasional
it
is
the
essential
of
the
lark
that
he
should
think
it
a
lark
that
he
should
laugh
at
it
even
when
he
does
it
being
english
myself
i
like
it
but
being
english
myself
i
know
it
is
connected
with
weaknesses
as
well
as
merits
in
its
irony
there
is
condescension
and
therefore
embarrassment
this
patronage
is
allied
to
the
patron
and
the
patron
is
allied
to
the
aristocratic
tradition
of
society
the
larks
are
a
variant
of
laziness
because
of
leisure
and
the
leisure
is
a
variant
of
the
security
and
even
supremacy
of
the
gentleman
when
an
undergraduate
at
oxford
smashes
half
a
hundred
windows
he
is
well
aware
that
the
incident
is
merely
a
trifle
he
can
be
trusted
to
explain
to
his
parents
and
guardians
that
it
was
merely
a
trifle
he
does
not
say
even
in
the
american
sense
that
he
was
bound
to
smash
the
windows
he
does
not
say
that
he
had
risen
from
a
to
smash
the
windows
he
does
not
especially
think
he
has
risen
at
all
he
knows
he
has
descended
though
with
delight
like
one
diving
or
sliding
down
the
banisters
to
something
flat
and
farcical
and
full
of
the
english
taste
for
the
bathos
he
has
collapsed
into
something
entirely
commonplace
though
the
owners
of
the
windows
may
possibly
not
think
so
this
rather
indescribable
element
runs
through
a
hundred
english
things
as
in
the
love
of
bathos
shown
even
in
the
sound
of
proper
names
so
that
even
the
yearning
lover
in
a
lyric
yearns
for
somebody
named
sally
rather
than
salome
and
for
a
place
called
wapping
rather
than
a
place
called
westermain
even
in
the
relapse
into
rowdiness
there
is
a
sort
of
relapse
into
comfort
there
is
also
what
is
so
large
a
part
of
comfort
carelessness
the
undergraduate
breaks
windows
because
he
does
not
care
about
windows
not
because
he
does
care
about
more
fresh
air
like
a
hygienist
or
about
more
light
like
a
german
poet
still
less
does
he
heroically
smash
a
hundred
windows
because
they
come
between
him
and
the
voice
of
asquith
but
least
of
all
does
he
do
it
because
he
seriously
prides
himself
on
the
energy
apart
from
its
aim
and
on
the
that
carries
it
through
he
is
not
to
smash
the
windows
even
in
the
sense
of
being
bent
upon
it
he
is
not
bound
at
all
but
rather
relaxed
and
his
violence
is
not
only
a
relaxation
but
a
laxity
finally
this
is
shown
in
the
fact
that
he
only
smashes
windows
when
he
is
in
the
mood
to
smash
windows
when
some
fortunate
conjunction
of
stars
and
all
the
tints
and
nuances
of
nature
whisper
to
him
that
it
would
be
well
to
smash
windows
but
the
american
is
always
ready
at
any
moment
to
waste
his
energies
on
the
wilder
and
more
suicidal
course
of
going
to
lectures
and
this
is
because
to
him
such
excitement
is
not
a
mood
but
a
moral
ideal
as
i
note
in
another
connection
much
of
the
english
mystery
would
be
clear
to
americans
if
they
understood
the
word
englishmen
are
very
moody
especially
when
they
smash
windows
but
i
doubt
if
many
americans
understand
exactly
what
we
mean
by
the
mood
especially
the
passive
mood
it
is
only
by
trying
to
get
some
notion
of
all
this
that
an
englishman
can
enjoy
the
final
crown
and
fruit
of
all
international
friendship
which
is
really
liking
an
american
to
be
american
if
we
only
think
that
parts
of
him
are
excellent
because
parts
of
him
are
english
it
would
be
far
more
sensible
to
stop
at
home
and
possibly
enjoy
the
society
of
a
whole
complete
englishman
but
anybody
who
does
understand
this
can
take
the
same
pleasure
in
an
american
being
american
that
he
does
in
a
thunderbolt
being
swift
and
a
barometer
being
sensitive
he
can
see
that
a
vivid
sensibility
and
vigilance
really
radiate
outwards
through
all
the
ramifications
of
machinery
and
even
of
materialism
he
can
see
that
the
american
uses
his
great
practical
powers
upon
very
small
provocation
but
he
can
also
see
that
there
is
a
kind
of
sense
of
honour
like
that
of
a
duellist
in
his
readiness
to
be
provoked
indeed
there
is
some
parallel
between
the
american
man
of
action
however
vulgar
his
aims
and
the
old
feudal
idea
of
the
gentleman
with
a
sword
at
his
side
the
gentleman
may
have
been
proud
of
being
strong
or
sturdy
he
may
too
often
have
been
proud
of
being
but
he
was
not
proud
of
being
on
the
contrary
he
was
proud
of
being
he
also
seriously
thought
that
sensitiveness
was
a
part
of
masculinity
it
may
be
very
absurd
to
read
of
two
irish
gentlemen
trying
to
kill
each
other
for
trifles
or
of
two
millionaires
trying
to
ruin
each
other
for
trash
but
the
very
pettiness
of
the
pretext
and
even
the
purpose
illustrates
the
same
conception
which
may
be
called
the
virtue
of
excitability
and
it
is
really
this
and
not
any
rubbish
about
iron
and
masterful
mentality
that
redeems
with
romance
their
clockwork
cosmos
and
its
industrial
ideals
being
a
live
wire
does
not
mean
that
the
nerves
should
be
like
wires
but
rather
that
the
very
wires
should
be
like
nerves
another
approximation
to
the
truth
would
be
to
say
that
an
american
is
really
not
ashamed
of
curiosity
it
is
not
so
simple
as
it
looks
men
will
carry
off
curiosity
with
various
kinds
of
laughter
and
bravado
just
as
they
will
carry
off
drunkenness
or
bankruptcy
but
very
few
people
are
really
proud
of
lying
on
a
and
very
few
people
are
really
proud
of
longing
to
look
through
a
i
do
not
speak
of
looking
through
it
which
involves
questions
of
honour
and
but
few
people
feel
that
even
the
desire
is
dignified
now
i
fancy
the
american
at
least
by
comparison
with
the
englishman
does
feel
that
his
curiosity
is
consistent
with
his
dignity
because
dignity
is
consistent
with
vivacity
he
feels
it
is
not
merely
the
curiosity
of
paul
pry
but
the
curiosity
of
christopher
columbus
he
is
not
a
spy
but
an
explorer
and
he
feels
his
greatness
rather
grow
with
his
refusal
to
turn
back
as
a
traveller
might
feel
taller
and
taller
as
he
neared
the
source
of
the
nile
or
the
passage
many
an
englishman
has
had
that
feeling
about
discoveries
in
dark
continents
but
he
does
not
often
have
it
about
discoveries
in
daily
life
the
one
type
does
believe
in
the
indignity
and
the
other
in
the
dignity
of
the
detective
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
ethics
in
the
merely
external
sense
it
involves
no
particular
comparison
in
practical
morals
and
manners
it
is
something
in
the
whole
poise
and
posture
of
the
self
of
the
way
a
man
carries
himself
for
men
are
not
only
affected
by
what
they
are
but
still
more
when
they
are
fools
by
what
they
think
they
are
and
when
they
are
wise
by
what
they
wish
to
be
there
are
truths
that
have
almost
become
untrue
by
becoming
untruthful
there
are
statements
so
often
stale
and
insincere
that
one
hesitates
to
use
them
even
when
they
stand
for
something
more
subtle
this
point
about
curiosity
is
not
the
conventional
complaint
against
the
american
interviewer
it
is
not
the
ordinary
joke
against
the
american
child
and
in
the
same
way
i
feel
the
danger
of
it
being
identified
with
the
cant
about
young
nation
if
i
say
that
it
has
some
of
the
attractions
not
of
american
childhood
but
of
real
childhood
there
is
some
truth
in
the
tradition
that
the
children
of
wealthy
americans
tend
to
be
too
precocious
and
luxurious
but
there
is
a
sense
in
which
we
can
really
say
that
if
the
children
are
like
adults
the
adults
are
like
children
and
that
sense
is
in
the
very
best
sense
of
childhood
it
is
something
which
the
modern
world
does
not
understand
it
is
something
that
modern
americans
do
not
understand
even
when
they
possess
it
but
i
think
they
do
possess
it
the
devil
can
quote
scripture
for
his
purpose
and
the
text
of
scripture
which
he
now
most
commonly
quotes
is
kingdom
of
heaven
is
within
you
that
text
has
been
the
stay
and
support
of
more
pharisees
and
prigs
and
spiritual
bullies
than
all
the
dogmas
in
creation
it
has
served
to
identify
with
the
peace
that
passes
all
understanding
and
the
text
to
be
quoted
in
answer
to
it
is
that
which
declares
that
no
man
can
receive
the
kingdom
except
as
a
little
child
what
we
are
to
have
inside
is
the
childlike
spirit
but
the
childlike
spirit
is
not
entirely
concerned
about
what
is
inside
it
is
the
first
mark
of
possessing
it
that
one
is
interested
in
what
is
outside
the
most
childlike
thing
about
a
child
is
his
curiosity
and
his
appetite
and
his
power
of
wonder
at
the
world
we
might
almost
say
that
the
whole
advantage
of
having
the
kingdom
within
is
that
we
look
for
it
somewhere
else
spirit
of
nine
times
out
of
ten
a
man
is
necessarily
the
narrowest
thing
about
him
this
is
not
particularly
paradoxical
it
is
when
we
come
to
think
of
it
quite
inevitable
his
vision
of
his
own
village
may
really
be
full
of
varieties
and
even
his
vision
of
his
own
nation
may
have
a
rough
resemblance
to
the
reality
but
his
vision
of
the
world
is
probably
smaller
than
the
world
his
vision
of
the
universe
is
certainly
much
smaller
than
the
universe
hence
he
is
never
so
inadequate
as
when
he
is
universal
he
is
never
so
limited
as
when
he
generalises
this
is
the
fallacy
in
the
many
modern
attempts
at
a
creedless
creed
at
something
variously
described
as
essential
christianity
or
undenominational
religion
or
a
world
faith
to
embrace
all
the
faiths
in
the
world
it
is
that
every
sectarian
is
more
sectarian
in
his
unsectarianism
than
he
is
in
his
sect
the
emancipation
of
a
baptist
is
a
very
baptist
emancipation
the
charity
of
a
buddhist
is
a
very
buddhist
charity
and
very
different
from
christian
charity
when
a
philosophy
embraces
everything
it
generally
squeezes
everything
and
squeezes
it
out
of
shape
when
it
digests
it
necessarily
assimilates
when
a
theosophist
absorbs
christianity
it
is
rather
as
a
cannibal
absorbs
christian
missionaries
in
this
sense
it
is
even
possible
for
the
larger
thing
to
be
swallowed
by
the
smaller
and
for
men
to
move
about
not
only
in
a
clapham
sect
but
in
a
clapham
cosmos
under
clapham
moon
and
stars
but
if
this
danger
exists
for
all
men
it
exists
especially
for
the
englishman
the
englishman
is
never
so
insular
as
when
he
is
imperial
except
indeed
when
he
is
international
in
private
life
he
is
a
good
friend
and
in
practical
politics
generally
a
good
ally
but
theoretical
politics
are
more
practical
than
practical
politics
and
in
theoretical
politics
the
englishman
is
the
worst
ally
the
world
ever
saw
this
is
all
the
more
curious
because
he
has
passed
so
much
of
his
historical
life
in
the
character
of
an
ally
he
has
been
in
twenty
great
alliances
and
never
understood
one
of
them
he
has
never
been
farther
away
from
european
politics
than
when
he
was
fighting
heroically
in
the
thick
of
them
i
myself
think
that
this
splendid
isolation
is
sometimes
really
splendid
so
long
as
it
is
isolation
and
does
not
imagine
itself
to
be
imperialism
or
internationalism
with
the
idea
of
being
international
with
the
idea
of
being
imperial
comes
the
frantic
and
farcical
idea
of
being
impartial
generally
speaking
men
are
never
so
mean
and
false
and
hypocritical
as
when
they
are
occupied
in
being
impartial
they
are
performing
the
first
and
most
typical
of
all
the
actions
of
the
devil
they
are
claiming
the
throne
of
god
even
when
it
is
not
hypocrisy
but
only
mental
confusion
it
is
always
a
confusion
worse
and
worse
confounded
we
see
it
in
the
impartial
historians
of
the
victorian
age
who
now
seem
far
more
victorian
than
the
partial
historians
hallam
wrote
about
the
middle
ages
but
hallam
was
far
less
mediaeval
than
macaulay
for
macaulay
was
at
least
a
fighter
huxley
had
more
mediaeval
sympathies
than
herbert
spencer
for
the
same
reason
that
huxley
was
a
fighter
they
both
fought
in
many
ways
for
the
limitations
of
their
own
rationalistic
epoch
but
they
were
nearer
the
truth
than
the
men
who
simply
assumed
those
limitations
as
rational
the
war
of
the
controversionalists
was
a
wider
thing
than
the
peace
of
the
arbiters
and
in
the
same
way
the
englishman
never
cuts
a
less
convincing
figure
before
other
nations
than
when
he
tries
to
arbitrate
between
them
i
have
by
this
time
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
necessity
of
saving
friendship
a
necessity
which
i
myself
feel
rather
too
strongly
to
be
satisfied
with
the
ambassadorial
and
editorial
style
of
achieving
it
i
have
already
said
that
the
worst
style
of
all
is
to
be
or
as
the
more
illiterate
would
express
to
be
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
the
way
for
the
englishman
to
do
it
is
to
be
english
but
to
know
that
he
is
english
and
not
everything
else
as
well
thus
the
only
sincere
answer
to
irish
nationalism
is
english
nationalism
which
is
a
reality
and
not
english
imperialism
which
is
a
reactionary
fiction
or
english
internationalism
which
is
a
revolutionary
one
for
the
english
are
reviled
for
their
imperialism
because
they
are
not
imperialistic
they
dislike
it
which
is
the
real
reason
why
they
do
it
badly
and
they
do
it
badly
which
is
the
real
reason
why
they
are
disliked
when
they
do
it
nobody
calls
france
imperialistic
because
she
has
absorbed
brittany
but
everybody
calls
england
imperialistic
because
she
has
not
absorbed
ireland
the
englishman
is
fixed
and
frozen
for
ever
in
the
attitude
of
a
ruthless
conqueror
not
because
he
has
conquered
such
people
but
because
he
has
not
conquered
them
but
he
is
always
trying
to
conquer
them
with
a
heroism
worthy
of
a
better
cause
for
the
really
native
and
vigorous
part
of
what
is
unfortunately
called
the
british
empire
is
not
an
empire
at
all
and
does
not
consist
of
these
conquered
provinces
at
all
it
is
not
an
empire
but
an
adventure
which
is
probably
a
much
finer
thing
it
was
not
the
power
of
making
strange
countries
similar
to
our
own
but
simply
the
pleasure
of
seeing
strange
countries
because
they
were
different
from
our
own
the
adventurer
did
indeed
like
the
third
son
set
out
to
seek
his
fortune
but
not
primarily
to
alter
other
people
fortunes
he
wished
to
trade
with
people
rather
than
to
rule
them
but
as
the
other
people
remained
different
from
him
so
did
he
remain
different
from
them
the
adventurer
saw
a
thousand
strange
things
and
remained
a
stranger
he
was
the
robinson
crusoe
on
a
hundred
desert
islands
and
on
each
he
remained
as
insular
as
on
his
own
island
what
is
wanted
for
the
cause
of
england
is
an
englishman
with
enough
imagination
to
love
his
country
from
the
outside
as
well
as
the
inside
that
is
we
need
somebody
who
will
do
for
the
english
what
has
never
been
done
for
them
but
what
is
done
for
any
outlandish
peasantry
or
even
any
savage
tribe
we
want
people
who
can
make
england
attractive
quite
apart
from
disputes
about
whether
england
is
strong
or
weak
we
want
somebody
to
explain
not
that
england
is
everywhere
but
what
england
is
anywhere
not
that
england
is
or
is
not
really
dying
but
why
we
do
not
want
her
to
die
for
this
purpose
the
official
and
conventional
compliments
or
claims
can
never
get
any
farther
than
pompous
abstractions
about
law
and
justice
and
truth
the
ideals
which
england
accepts
as
every
civilised
state
accepts
them
and
violates
as
every
civilised
state
violates
them
that
is
not
the
way
in
which
the
picture
of
any
people
has
ever
been
painted
on
the
sympathetic
imagination
of
the
world
enthusiasts
for
old
japan
did
not
tell
us
that
the
japs
recognised
the
existence
of
abstract
morality
but
that
they
lived
in
paper
houses
or
wrote
letters
with
men
who
wished
to
interest
us
in
arabs
did
not
confine
themselves
to
saying
that
they
are
monotheists
or
moralists
they
filled
our
romances
with
the
rush
of
arab
steeds
or
the
colours
of
strange
tents
or
carpets
what
we
want
is
somebody
who
will
do
for
the
englishman
with
his
front
garden
what
was
done
for
the
jap
and
his
paper
house
who
shall
understand
the
englishman
with
his
dog
as
well
as
the
arab
with
his
horse
in
a
word
what
nobody
has
really
tried
to
do
is
the
one
thing
that
really
wants
doing
it
is
to
make
england
attractive
as
a
nationality
and
even
as
a
small
nationality
for
it
is
a
wild
folly
to
suppose
that
nations
will
love
each
other
because
they
are
alike
they
will
never
really
do
that
unless
they
are
really
alike
and
then
they
will
not
be
nations
nations
can
love
each
other
as
men
and
women
love
each
other
not
because
they
are
alike
but
because
they
are
different
it
can
easily
be
shown
i
fancy
that
in
every
case
where
a
real
public
sympathy
was
aroused
for
some
unfortunate
foreign
people
it
has
always
been
accompanied
with
a
particular
and
positive
interest
in
their
most
foreign
customs
and
their
most
foreign
externals
the
man
who
made
a
romance
of
the
scotch
made
a
romance
of
his
kilt
and
even
of
his
dirk
the
friend
of
the
red
indians
was
interested
in
picture
writing
and
had
some
tendency
to
be
interested
in
scalping
to
take
a
more
serious
example
such
nations
as
serbia
had
been
largely
commended
to
international
consideration
by
the
study
of
serbian
epics
or
serbian
songs
the
epoch
of
negro
emancipation
was
also
the
epoch
of
negro
melodies
those
who
wept
over
uncle
tom
also
laughed
over
uncle
remus
and
just
as
the
admiration
for
the
redskin
almost
became
an
apology
for
scalping
the
mysterious
fascination
of
the
african
has
sometimes
almost
led
us
into
the
fringes
of
the
black
forest
of
voodoo
but
the
sort
of
interest
that
is
felt
even
in
the
and
the
cannibal
the
torturer
and
the
that
sort
of
interest
has
never
been
felt
in
the
englishman
and
this
is
the
more
extraordinary
because
the
englishman
is
really
very
interesting
he
is
interesting
in
a
special
degree
in
this
special
manner
he
is
interesting
because
he
is
individual
no
man
in
the
world
is
more
misrepresented
by
everything
official
or
even
in
the
ordinary
sense
national
a
description
of
english
life
must
be
a
description
of
private
life
in
that
sense
there
is
no
public
life
in
that
sense
there
is
no
public
opinion
there
have
never
been
those
prairie
fires
of
public
opinion
in
england
which
often
sweep
over
america
at
any
rate
there
have
never
been
any
such
popular
revolutions
since
the
popular
revolutions
of
the
middle
ages
the
english
are
a
nation
of
amateurs
they
are
even
a
nation
of
eccentrics
an
englishman
is
never
more
english
than
when
he
is
considered
a
lunatic
by
the
other
englishmen
this
can
be
clearly
seen
in
a
figure
like
johnson
who
has
become
national
not
by
being
normal
but
by
being
extraordinary
to
express
this
mysterious
people
to
explain
or
suggest
why
they
like
tall
hedges
and
heavy
breakfasts
and
crooked
roads
and
small
gardens
with
large
fences
and
why
they
alone
among
christians
have
kept
quite
consistently
the
great
christian
glory
of
the
open
fireplace
here
would
be
a
strange
and
stimulating
opportunity
for
any
of
the
artists
in
words
who
study
the
souls
of
strange
peoples
that
would
be
the
true
way
to
create
a
friendship
between
england
and
america
or
between
england
and
anything
else
yes
even
between
england
and
ireland
for
this
justice
at
least
has
already
been
done
to
ireland
and
as
an
indignant
patriot
i
demand
a
more
equal
treatment
for
the
two
nations
i
have
already
noted
the
commonplace
that
in
order
to
teach
internationalism
we
must
talk
nationalism
we
must
make
the
nations
as
nations
less
odious
or
mysterious
to
each
other
we
do
not
make
men
love
each
other
by
describing
a
monster
with
a
million
arms
and
legs
but
by
describing
the
men
as
men
with
their
separate
and
even
solitary
emotions
as
this
has
a
particular
application
to
the
emotions
of
the
englishman
i
will
return
to
the
topic
once
more
now
americans
have
a
power
that
is
the
soul
and
success
of
democracy
the
power
of
spontaneous
social
organisation
their
high
spirits
their
humane
ideals
are
really
creative
they
abound
in
unofficial
institutions
we
might
almost
say
in
unofficial
officialism
nobody
who
has
felt
the
presence
of
all
the
leagues
and
guilds
and
college
clubs
will
deny
that
whitman
was
national
when
he
said
he
would
build
states
and
cities
out
of
the
love
of
comrades
when
all
this
communal
enthusiasm
collides
with
the
englishman
it
too
often
seems
literally
to
leave
him
cold
they
say
he
is
reserved
they
possibly
think
he
is
rude
and
the
englishman
having
been
taught
his
own
history
all
wrong
is
only
too
likely
to
take
the
criticism
as
a
compliment
he
admits
that
he
is
reserved
because
he
is
stern
and
strong
or
even
that
he
is
rude
because
he
is
shrewd
and
candid
but
as
a
fact
he
is
not
rude
and
not
especially
reserved
at
least
reserve
is
not
the
meaning
of
his
reluctance
the
real
difference
lies
i
think
in
the
fact
that
american
high
spirits
are
not
only
high
but
level
that
the
hilarious
american
spirit
is
like
a
plateau
and
the
humorous
english
spirit
like
a
ragged
mountain
range
the
englishman
is
moody
which
does
not
in
the
least
mean
that
the
englishman
is
morose
dickens
as
we
all
feel
in
reading
his
books
was
boisterously
english
dickens
was
moody
when
he
wrote
but
he
was
also
moody
when
he
wrote
that
is
he
was
in
another
and
much
healthier
mood
the
mood
was
normal
to
him
in
the
sense
that
nine
times
out
of
ten
he
felt
and
wrote
in
that
humorous
and
hilarious
mood
but
he
was
if
ever
there
was
one
a
man
of
moods
and
all
the
more
of
a
typical
englishman
for
being
a
man
of
moods
but
it
was
because
of
this
almost
entirely
that
he
had
a
misunderstanding
with
america
in
america
there
are
no
moods
or
there
is
only
one
mood
it
is
the
same
whether
it
is
called
hustle
or
uplift
whether
we
regard
it
as
the
heroic
love
of
comrades
or
the
last
hysteria
of
the
herd
instinct
it
has
been
said
of
the
typical
english
aristocrats
of
the
government
offices
that
they
resemble
certain
ornamental
fountains
and
play
from
ten
till
four
and
it
is
true
that
an
englishman
even
an
english
aristocrat
is
not
always
inclined
to
play
any
more
than
to
work
but
american
sociability
is
not
like
the
trafalgar
fountains
it
is
like
niagara
it
never
stops
under
the
silent
stars
or
the
rolling
storms
there
seems
always
to
be
the
same
human
heat
and
pressure
behind
it
it
is
like
the
central
heating
of
hotels
as
explained
in
the
advertisements
and
announcements
the
temperature
can
be
regulated
but
it
is
not
and
it
is
always
rather
overpowering
for
an
englishman
whose
mood
changes
like
his
own
mutable
and
shifting
sky
the
english
mood
is
very
like
the
english
weather
it
is
a
nuisance
and
a
national
necessity
if
any
one
wishes
to
understand
the
quarrel
between
dickens
and
the
americans
let
him
turn
to
that
chapter
in
in
which
young
martin
has
to
receive
endless
defiles
and
deputations
of
total
strangers
each
announced
by
name
and
demanding
formal
salutation
there
are
several
things
to
be
noticed
about
this
incident
to
begin
with
it
did
not
happen
to
martin
chuzzlewit
but
it
did
happen
to
charles
dickens
dickens
is
incorporating
almost
without
alteration
a
passage
from
a
diary
in
the
middle
of
a
story
as
he
did
when
he
included
the
admirable
account
of
the
prison
petition
of
john
dickens
as
the
prison
petition
of
wilkins
micawber
there
is
no
particular
reason
why
even
the
gregarious
americans
should
so
throng
the
portals
of
a
perfectly
obscure
steerage
passenger
like
young
chuzzlewit
there
was
every
reason
why
they
should
throng
the
portals
of
the
author
of
and
and
no
doubt
they
did
if
i
may
be
permitted
the
aleatory
image
you
bet
they
did
similar
troops
of
sociable
human
beings
have
visited
much
more
insignificant
english
travellers
in
america
with
some
of
whom
i
am
myself
acquainted
i
myself
have
the
luck
to
be
a
little
more
stodgy
and
less
sensitive
than
many
of
my
countrymen
and
certainly
less
sensitive
than
dickens
but
i
know
what
it
was
that
annoyed
him
about
that
unending
and
unchanging
stream
of
american
visitors
it
was
the
unending
and
unchanging
stream
of
american
sociability
and
high
spirits
a
people
living
on
such
a
lofty
but
level
tableland
do
not
understand
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
english
temperament
the
temper
of
a
nation
of
eccentrics
or
as
they
used
to
be
called
of
humorists
there
is
something
very
national
in
the
very
name
of
the
old
play
of
man
in
his
but
the
play
more
often
acted
in
real
life
is
man
out
of
his
humour
it
is
true
as
matthew
arnold
said
that
an
englishman
wants
to
do
as
he
likes
but
it
is
not
always
true
even
that
he
likes
what
he
likes
an
englishman
can
be
friendly
and
yet
not
feel
friendly
or
he
can
be
friendly
and
yet
not
feel
hospitable
or
he
can
feel
hospitable
and
yet
not
welcome
those
whom
he
really
loves
he
can
think
almost
with
tears
of
tenderness
about
people
at
a
distance
who
would
be
bores
if
they
came
in
at
the
door
american
sociability
sweeps
away
any
such
subtlety
it
can
not
be
expected
to
understand
the
paradox
or
perversity
of
the
englishman
who
thus
can
feel
friendly
and
avoid
friends
that
is
the
truth
in
the
suggestion
that
dickens
was
sentimental
it
means
that
he
probably
felt
most
sociable
when
he
was
solitary
in
all
these
attempts
to
describe
the
indescribable
to
indicate
the
real
but
unconscious
differences
between
the
two
peoples
i
have
tried
to
balance
my
words
without
the
irrelevant
bias
of
praise
and
blame
both
characteristics
always
cut
both
ways
on
one
side
this
comradeship
makes
possible
a
certain
communal
courage
a
democratic
derision
of
rich
men
in
high
places
that
is
not
easy
in
our
smaller
and
more
stratified
society
on
the
other
hand
the
englishman
has
certainly
more
liberty
if
less
equality
and
fraternity
but
the
richest
compensation
of
the
englishman
is
not
even
in
the
word
but
rather
in
the
word
that
humour
of
escape
or
seclusion
that
genial
isolation
that
healing
of
wounded
friendship
by
what
christian
science
would
call
absent
treatment
that
is
the
best
atmosphere
of
all
for
the
creation
of
great
poetry
and
out
of
that
came
ruined
choirs
where
late
the
sweet
birds
sang
and
wast
not
made
for
death
immortal
bird
in
this
sense
it
is
indeed
true
that
poetry
is
emotion
remembered
in
tranquillity
which
may
be
extended
to
mean
affection
remembered
in
loneliness
there
is
in
it
a
spirit
not
only
of
detachment
but
even
of
distance
a
spirit
which
does
desire
as
in
the
old
english
rhyme
to
be
not
only
over
the
hills
but
also
far
away
in
other
words
in
so
far
as
it
is
true
that
the
englishman
is
an
exception
to
the
great
truth
of
aristotle
it
is
because
he
is
not
so
near
to
aristotle
as
he
is
to
homer
in
so
far
as
he
is
not
by
nature
a
political
animal
it
is
because
he
is
a
poetical
animal
we
see
it
in
his
relations
to
the
other
animals
his
quaint
and
almost
illogical
love
of
dogs
and
horses
and
dependants
whose
political
rights
can
not
possibly
be
defined
in
logic
many
forms
of
hunting
or
fishing
are
but
an
excuse
for
the
same
thing
which
the
shameless
literary
man
does
without
any
excuse
sport
is
speechless
poetry
it
would
be
easy
for
a
foreigner
by
taking
a
few
liberties
with
the
facts
to
make
a
satire
about
the
sort
of
silent
shelley
who
decides
ultimately
to
shoot
the
skylark
it
would
be
easy
to
answer
these
poetic
suggestions
by
saying
that
he
himself
might
be
responsible
for
ruining
the
choirs
where
late
the
sweet
birds
sang
or
that
the
immortal
bird
was
likely
to
be
mortal
when
he
was
out
with
his
gun
but
these
international
satires
are
never
just
and
the
real
relations
of
an
englishman
and
an
english
bird
are
far
more
delicate
it
would
be
equally
easy
and
equally
unjust
to
suggest
a
similar
satire
against
american
democracy
and
represent
americans
merely
as
birds
of
a
feather
who
can
do
nothing
but
flock
together
but
this
would
leave
out
the
fact
that
at
least
it
is
not
the
white
feather
that
democracy
is
capable
of
defiance
and
of
death
for
an
idea
touching
the
souls
of
great
nations
these
criticisms
are
generally
false
because
they
are
critical
but
when
we
are
quite
sure
that
we
rejoice
in
a
nation
strength
then
and
not
before
we
are
justified
in
judging
its
weakness
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
rejoice
in
any
democratic
success
without
and
nobody
who
knows
me
will
credit
me
with
a
covert
sneer
at
civic
equality
and
this
being
granted
i
do
think
there
is
a
danger
in
the
gregariousness
of
american
society
the
danger
of
democracy
is
not
anarchy
on
the
contrary
it
is
monotony
and
it
is
touching
this
that
all
my
experience
has
increased
my
conviction
that
a
great
deal
that
is
called
female
emancipation
has
merely
been
the
increase
of
female
convention
now
the
males
of
every
community
are
far
too
conventional
it
was
the
females
who
were
individual
and
criticised
the
conventions
of
the
tribe
if
the
females
become
conventional
also
there
is
a
danger
of
individuality
being
lost
this
indeed
is
not
peculiar
to
america
it
is
common
to
the
whole
modern
industrial
world
and
to
everything
which
substitutes
the
impersonal
atmosphere
of
the
state
for
the
personal
atmosphere
of
the
home
but
it
is
emphasised
in
america
by
the
curious
contradiction
that
americans
do
in
theory
value
and
even
venerate
the
individual
but
individualism
is
still
the
foe
of
individuality
where
men
are
trying
to
compete
with
each
other
they
are
trying
to
copy
each
other
they
become
featureless
by
the
same
part
personality
in
becoming
a
conscious
ideal
becomes
a
common
ideal
in
this
respect
perhaps
there
is
really
something
to
be
learnt
from
the
englishman
with
his
turn
or
twist
in
the
direction
of
private
life
those
who
have
travelled
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
see
all
the
american
hotels
and
none
of
the
american
houses
are
sometimes
driven
to
the
excess
of
saying
that
the
americans
have
no
private
life
but
even
if
the
exaggeration
has
a
hint
of
truth
we
must
balance
it
with
the
corresponding
truth
that
the
english
have
no
public
life
they
on
their
side
have
still
to
learn
the
meaning
of
the
public
thing
the
republic
and
how
great
are
the
dangers
of
cowardice
and
corruption
when
the
very
state
itself
has
become
a
state
secret
the
english
are
patriotic
but
patriotism
is
the
unconscious
form
of
nationalism
it
is
being
national
without
understanding
the
meaning
of
a
nation
the
americans
are
on
the
whole
too
kept
moving
too
much
in
the
pace
of
public
life
with
all
its
temptations
to
superficiality
and
fashion
too
much
aware
of
outside
opinion
and
with
too
much
appetite
for
outside
criticism
but
the
english
are
much
too
unconscious
and
would
be
the
better
for
an
increase
in
many
forms
of
consciousness
including
consciousness
of
sin
but
even
their
sin
is
ignorance
of
their
real
virtue
the
most
admirable
english
things
are
not
the
things
that
are
most
admired
by
the
english
or
for
which
the
english
admire
themselves
they
are
things
now
blindly
neglected
and
in
daily
danger
of
being
destroyed
it
is
all
the
worse
that
they
should
be
destroyed
because
there
is
really
nothing
like
them
in
the
world
that
is
why
i
have
suggested
a
note
of
nationalism
rather
than
patriotism
for
the
english
the
power
of
seeing
their
nation
as
a
nation
and
not
as
the
nature
of
things
we
say
of
some
ballad
from
the
balkans
or
some
peasant
costume
in
the
netherlands
that
it
is
unique
but
the
good
things
of
england
really
are
unique
our
very
isolation
from
continental
wars
and
revolutionary
reconstructions
have
kept
them
unique
the
particular
kind
of
beauty
there
is
in
an
english
village
the
particular
kind
of
humour
there
is
in
an
english
are
things
that
can
not
be
found
in
lands
where
the
village
is
far
more
simply
and
equally
governed
or
where
the
vine
is
far
more
honourably
served
and
praised
yet
we
shall
not
save
them
by
merely
sinking
into
them
with
the
conservative
sort
of
contentment
even
if
the
commercial
rapacity
of
our
plutocratic
reforms
would
allow
us
to
do
so
we
must
in
a
sense
get
far
away
from
england
in
order
to
behold
her
we
must
rise
above
patriotism
in
order
to
be
practically
patriotic
we
must
have
some
sense
of
more
varied
and
remote
things
before
these
vanishing
virtues
can
be
seen
suddenly
for
what
they
are
almost
as
one
might
fancy
that
a
man
would
have
to
rise
to
the
dizziest
heights
of
the
divine
understanding
before
he
saw
as
from
a
peak
far
above
a
whirlpool
how
precious
is
his
perishing
soul
future
of
the
title
of
this
final
chapter
requires
an
apology
i
do
not
need
to
be
reminded
alas
that
the
whole
book
requires
an
apology
it
is
written
in
accordance
with
a
ritual
or
custom
in
which
i
could
see
no
particular
harm
and
which
gives
me
a
very
interesting
subject
but
a
custom
which
it
would
be
not
altogether
easy
to
justify
in
logic
everybody
who
goes
to
america
for
a
short
time
is
expected
to
write
a
book
and
nearly
everybody
does
a
man
who
takes
a
holiday
at
trouville
or
dieppe
is
not
confronted
on
his
return
with
the
question
is
your
book
on
france
going
to
appear
a
man
who
betakes
himself
to
switzerland
for
the
winter
sports
is
not
instantly
pinned
by
the
statement
suppose
your
history
of
the
helvetian
republic
is
coming
out
this
spring
lecturing
at
least
my
kind
of
lecturing
is
not
much
more
serious
or
meritorious
than
or
and
it
happens
to
afford
the
far
less
opportunity
of
seeing
the
daily
life
of
the
people
of
all
this
i
am
only
too
well
aware
and
my
only
defence
is
that
i
am
at
least
sincere
in
my
enjoyment
and
appreciation
of
america
and
equally
sincere
in
my
interest
in
its
most
serious
problem
which
i
think
a
very
serious
problem
indeed
the
problem
of
democracy
in
the
modern
world
democracy
may
be
a
very
obvious
and
facile
affair
for
plutocrats
and
politicians
who
only
have
to
use
it
as
a
rhetorical
term
but
democracy
is
a
very
serious
problem
for
democrats
i
certainly
do
not
apologise
for
the
word
democracy
but
i
do
apologise
for
the
word
future
i
am
no
futurist
and
any
conjectures
i
make
must
be
taken
with
the
grain
of
salt
which
is
indeed
the
salt
of
the
earth
the
decent
and
moderate
humility
which
comes
from
a
belief
in
free
will
that
faith
is
in
itself
a
divine
doubt
i
do
not
believe
in
any
of
the
scientific
predictions
about
mankind
i
notice
that
they
always
fail
to
predict
any
of
the
purely
human
developments
of
men
i
also
notice
that
even
their
successes
prove
the
same
truth
as
their
failures
for
their
successful
predictions
are
not
about
men
but
about
machines
but
there
are
two
things
which
a
man
may
reasonably
do
in
stating
the
probabilities
of
a
problem
which
do
not
involve
any
claim
to
be
a
prophet
the
first
is
to
tell
the
truth
and
especially
the
neglected
truth
about
the
tendencies
that
have
already
accumulated
in
human
history
any
miscalculation
about
which
must
at
least
mislead
us
in
any
case
we
can
not
be
certain
of
being
right
about
the
future
but
we
can
be
almost
certain
of
being
wrong
about
the
future
if
we
are
wrong
about
the
past
the
other
thing
that
he
can
do
is
to
note
what
ideas
necessarily
go
together
by
their
own
nature
what
ideas
will
triumph
together
or
fall
together
hence
it
follows
that
this
final
chapter
must
consist
of
two
things
the
first
is
a
summary
of
what
has
really
happened
to
the
idea
of
democracy
in
recent
times
the
second
a
suggestion
of
the
fundamental
doctrine
which
is
necessary
for
its
triumph
at
any
time
the
last
hundred
years
has
seen
a
general
decline
in
the
democratic
idea
if
there
be
anybody
left
to
whom
this
historical
truth
appears
a
paradox
it
is
only
because
during
that
period
nobody
has
been
taught
history
least
of
all
the
history
of
ideas
if
a
sort
of
intellectual
inquisition
had
been
established
for
the
definition
and
differentiation
of
heresies
it
would
have
been
found
that
the
original
republican
orthodoxy
had
suffered
more
and
more
from
secessions
schisms
and
backslidings
the
highest
point
of
democratic
idealism
and
conviction
was
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
american
republic
was
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
equal
it
was
then
that
the
largest
number
of
men
had
the
most
serious
sort
of
conviction
that
the
political
problem
could
be
solved
by
the
vote
of
peoples
instead
of
the
arbitrary
power
of
princes
and
privileged
orders
these
men
encountered
various
difficulties
and
made
various
compromises
in
relation
to
the
practical
politics
of
their
time
in
england
they
preserved
aristocracy
in
america
they
preserved
slavery
but
though
they
had
more
difficulties
they
had
less
doubts
since
their
time
democracy
has
been
steadily
disintegrated
by
doubts
and
these
political
doubts
have
been
contemporary
with
and
often
identical
with
religious
doubts
this
fact
could
be
followed
over
almost
the
whole
field
of
the
modern
world
in
this
place
it
will
be
more
appropriate
to
take
the
great
american
example
of
slavery
i
have
found
traces
in
all
sorts
of
intelligent
quarters
of
an
extraordinary
idea
that
all
the
fathers
of
the
republic
owned
black
men
like
beasts
of
burden
because
they
knew
no
better
until
the
light
of
liberty
was
revealed
to
them
by
john
brown
and
beecher
stowe
one
of
the
best
weekly
papers
in
england
said
recently
that
even
those
who
drew
up
the
declaration
of
independence
did
not
include
negroes
in
its
generalisation
about
humanity
this
is
quite
consistent
with
the
current
convention
in
which
we
were
all
brought
up
the
theory
that
the
heart
of
humanity
broadens
in
ever
larger
circles
of
brotherhood
till
we
pass
from
embracing
a
black
man
to
adoring
a
black
beetle
unfortunately
it
is
quite
inconsistent
with
the
facts
of
american
history
the
facts
show
that
in
this
problem
of
the
old
south
the
eighteenth
century
was
liberal
than
the
nineteenth
century
there
was
sympathy
for
the
negro
in
the
school
of
jefferson
than
in
the
school
of
jefferson
davis
jefferson
in
the
dark
estate
of
his
simple
deism
said
the
sight
of
slavery
in
his
country
made
him
tremble
remembering
that
god
is
just
his
fellow
southerners
after
a
century
of
the
world
advance
said
that
slavery
in
itself
was
good
when
they
did
not
go
farther
and
say
that
negroes
in
themselves
were
bad
and
they
were
supported
in
this
by
the
great
and
growing
modern
suspicion
that
nature
is
unjust
difficulties
seemed
inevitably
to
delay
justice
to
the
mind
of
jefferson
but
so
they
did
to
the
mind
of
lincoln
but
that
the
slave
was
human
and
the
servitude
inhuman
that
was
if
anything
clearer
to
jefferson
than
to
lincoln
the
fact
is
that
the
utter
separation
and
subordination
of
the
black
like
a
beast
was
a
it
was
a
growth
of
enlightenment
and
experiment
a
triumph
of
science
over
superstition
it
was
way
the
world
was
going
as
matthew
arnold
reverentially
remarked
in
some
connection
perhaps
as
part
of
a
definition
of
god
anyhow
it
was
not
definition
of
god
he
fancied
in
his
patriarchal
way
a
father
who
had
made
all
men
brothers
and
brutally
unbrotherly
as
was
the
practice
such
democratical
deists
never
dreamed
of
denying
the
theory
it
was
not
until
the
scientific
sophistries
began
that
brotherhood
was
really
disputed
gobineau
who
began
most
of
the
modern
talk
about
the
superiority
and
inferiority
of
racial
stocks
was
seized
upon
eagerly
by
the
less
generous
of
the
and
trumpeted
as
a
new
truth
of
science
and
a
new
defence
of
slavery
it
was
not
really
until
the
dawn
of
darwinism
when
all
our
social
relations
began
to
smell
of
the
that
men
thought
of
the
barbarian
as
only
a
first
and
the
baboon
as
a
second
cousin
the
full
servile
philosophy
has
been
a
modern
and
even
a
recent
thing
made
in
an
age
whose
invisible
deity
was
the
missing
link
the
missing
link
was
a
true
metaphor
in
more
ways
than
one
and
most
of
all
in
its
suggestion
of
a
chain
by
a
symbolic
coincidence
indeed
slavery
grew
more
brazen
and
brutal
under
the
encouragement
of
more
than
one
movement
of
the
progressive
sort
its
youth
was
renewed
for
it
by
the
industrial
prosperity
of
lancashire
and
under
that
influence
it
became
a
commercial
and
competitive
instead
of
a
patriarchal
and
customary
thing
we
may
say
with
no
exaggerative
irony
that
the
unconscious
patrons
of
slavery
were
huxley
and
cobden
the
machines
of
manchester
were
manufacturing
a
great
many
more
things
than
the
manufacturers
knew
or
wanted
to
know
but
they
were
certainly
manufacturing
the
fetters
of
the
slave
doubtless
out
of
the
best
quality
of
steel
and
iron
but
this
is
a
minor
illustration
of
the
modern
tendency
as
compared
with
the
main
stream
of
scepticism
which
was
destroying
democracy
evolution
became
more
and
more
a
vision
of
the
of
our
brotherhood
till
by
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
genius
of
its
greatest
scientific
romancer
saw
it
end
in
the
anthropophagous
antics
of
the
time
machine
so
far
from
evolution
lifting
us
above
the
idea
of
enslaving
men
it
was
providing
us
at
least
with
a
logical
and
potential
argument
for
eating
them
in
the
case
of
the
american
negroes
it
may
be
remarked
it
does
at
any
rate
permit
the
preliminary
course
of
roasting
them
all
this
materialistic
hardening
which
replaced
the
remorse
of
jefferson
was
part
of
the
growing
evolutionary
suspicion
that
savages
were
not
a
part
of
the
human
race
or
rather
that
there
was
really
no
such
thing
as
the
human
race
the
south
had
begun
by
agreeing
reluctantly
to
the
enslavement
of
men
the
south
ended
by
agreeing
equally
reluctantly
to
the
emancipation
of
monkeys
that
is
what
had
happened
to
the
democratic
ideal
in
a
hundred
years
anybody
can
test
it
by
comparing
the
final
phase
i
will
not
say
with
the
ideal
of
jefferson
but
with
the
ideal
of
johnson
there
was
far
more
horror
of
slavery
in
an
tory
like
johnson
than
in
a
democrat
like
stephen
douglas
stephen
douglas
may
be
mentioned
because
he
is
a
very
representative
type
of
the
age
of
evolution
and
expansion
a
man
thinking
in
continents
like
cecil
rhodes
human
and
hopeful
in
a
truly
american
fashion
and
as
a
consequence
cold
and
careless
rather
than
hostile
in
the
matter
of
the
old
mystical
doctrines
of
equality
he
not
care
whether
slavery
was
voted
up
or
voted
down
his
great
opponent
lincoln
did
indeed
care
very
much
but
it
was
an
intense
individual
conviction
with
lincoln
exactly
as
it
was
with
johnson
i
doubt
if
the
spirit
of
the
age
was
not
much
more
behind
douglas
and
his
westward
expansion
of
the
white
race
i
am
sure
that
more
and
more
men
were
coming
to
be
in
the
particular
mental
condition
of
douglas
men
in
whom
the
old
moral
and
mystical
ideals
had
been
undermined
by
doubt
but
only
with
a
negative
effect
of
indifference
their
positive
convictions
were
all
concerned
with
what
some
called
progress
and
some
imperialism
it
is
true
that
there
was
a
sincere
sectional
enthusiasm
against
slavery
in
the
north
and
that
the
slaves
were
actually
emancipated
in
the
nineteenth
century
but
i
doubt
whether
the
abolitionists
would
ever
have
secured
abolition
abolition
was
a
of
the
civil
war
which
was
fought
for
quite
other
reasons
anyhow
if
slavery
had
somehow
survived
to
the
age
of
rhodes
and
roosevelt
and
evolutionary
imperialism
i
doubt
if
the
slaves
would
ever
have
been
emancipated
at
all
certainly
if
it
had
survived
till
the
modern
movement
for
the
servile
state
they
would
never
have
been
emancipated
at
all
why
should
the
world
take
the
chains
off
the
black
man
when
it
was
just
putting
them
on
the
white
and
in
so
far
as
we
owe
the
change
to
lincoln
we
owe
it
to
jefferson
exactly
what
gives
its
real
dignity
to
the
figure
of
lincoln
is
that
he
stands
invoking
a
primitive
first
principle
of
the
age
of
innocence
and
holding
up
the
tables
of
an
ancient
law
the
trend
of
the
nineteenth
century
repeating
hold
these
truths
to
be
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
to
a
generation
that
was
more
and
more
disposed
to
say
something
like
this
hold
these
truths
to
be
probable
enough
for
pragmatists
that
all
things
looking
like
men
were
evolved
somehow
being
endowed
by
heredity
and
environment
with
no
equal
rights
but
very
unequal
wrongs
and
so
on
i
do
not
believe
that
creed
left
to
itself
would
ever
have
founded
a
state
and
i
am
pretty
certain
that
left
to
itself
it
would
never
have
overthrown
a
slave
state
what
it
did
do
as
i
have
said
was
to
produce
some
very
wonderful
literary
and
artistic
flights
of
sceptical
imagination
the
world
did
have
new
visions
if
they
were
visions
of
monsters
in
the
moon
and
martians
striding
about
like
spiders
as
tall
as
the
sky
and
the
workmen
and
capitalists
becoming
two
separate
species
so
that
one
could
devour
the
other
as
gaily
and
greedily
as
a
cat
devours
a
bird
no
one
has
done
justice
to
the
meaning
of
wells
and
his
original
departure
in
fantastic
fiction
to
these
nightmares
that
were
the
last
apocalypse
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
meant
that
the
bottom
had
fallen
out
of
the
mind
at
last
that
the
bridge
of
brotherhood
had
broken
down
in
the
modern
brain
letting
up
from
the
chasms
this
infernal
light
like
a
dawn
all
had
grown
dizzy
with
degree
and
relativity
so
that
there
would
not
be
so
very
much
difference
between
eating
dog
and
eating
darkie
or
between
eating
darkie
and
eating
dago
there
were
different
sorts
of
apes
but
there
was
no
doubt
that
we
were
the
superior
sort
against
all
this
irresistible
force
stood
one
immovable
post
against
all
this
dance
of
doubt
and
degree
stood
something
that
can
best
be
symbolised
by
a
simple
example
an
ape
can
not
be
a
priest
but
a
negro
can
be
a
priest
the
dogmatic
type
of
christianity
especially
the
catholic
type
of
christianity
had
riveted
itself
irrevocably
to
the
manhood
of
all
men
where
its
faith
was
fixed
by
creeds
and
councils
it
could
not
save
itself
even
by
surrender
it
could
not
gradually
dilute
democracy
as
could
a
merely
sceptical
or
secular
democrat
there
stood
in
fact
or
in
possibility
the
solid
and
smiling
figure
of
a
black
bishop
and
he
was
either
a
man
claiming
the
most
towering
spiritual
privileges
of
a
man
or
he
was
the
mere
buffoonery
and
blasphemy
of
a
monkey
in
a
mitre
that
is
the
point
about
christian
and
catholic
democracy
it
is
not
that
it
is
necessarily
at
any
moment
more
democratic
it
is
that
its
indestructible
minimum
of
democracy
really
is
indestructible
and
by
the
nature
of
things
that
mystical
democracy
was
destined
to
survive
when
every
other
sort
of
democracy
was
free
to
destroy
itself
and
whenever
democracy
destroying
itself
is
suddenly
moved
to
save
itself
it
always
grasps
at
rag
or
tag
of
that
old
tradition
that
alone
is
sure
of
itself
hundreds
have
heard
the
story
about
the
mediaeval
demagogue
who
went
about
repeating
the
rhyme
when
adam
delved
and
eve
span
who
was
then
the
gentleman
many
have
doubtless
offered
the
obvious
answer
to
the
question
serpent
but
few
seem
to
have
noticed
what
would
be
the
more
modern
answer
to
the
question
if
that
innocent
agitator
went
about
propounding
it
never
delved
and
eve
never
span
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
never
existed
they
are
fragments
of
a
mythos
and
adam
is
only
a
slight
variation
of
pronounced
uttu
for
the
real
beginning
of
humanity
we
refer
you
to
darwin
of
and
then
the
modern
man
would
go
on
to
justify
plutocracy
to
the
mediaeval
man
by
talking
about
the
struggle
for
life
and
the
survival
of
the
fittest
and
how
the
strongest
man
seized
authority
by
means
of
anarchy
and
proved
himself
a
gentleman
by
behaving
like
a
cad
now
i
do
not
base
my
beliefs
on
the
theology
of
john
ball
or
on
the
literal
and
materialistic
reading
of
the
text
of
genesis
though
i
think
the
story
of
adam
and
eve
infinitely
less
absurd
and
unlikely
than
that
of
the
prehistoric
man
who
could
fight
a
hundred
men
but
i
do
note
the
fact
that
the
idealism
of
the
leveller
could
be
put
in
the
form
of
an
appeal
to
scripture
and
could
not
be
put
in
the
form
of
an
appeal
to
science
and
i
do
note
also
that
democrats
were
still
driven
to
make
the
same
appeal
even
in
the
very
century
of
science
tennyson
was
if
ever
there
was
one
an
evolutionist
in
his
vision
and
an
aristocrat
in
his
sympathies
he
was
always
boasting
that
john
bull
was
evolutionary
and
not
revolutionary
even
as
these
frenchmen
he
did
not
pretend
to
have
any
creed
beyond
faintly
trusting
the
larger
hope
but
when
human
dignity
is
really
in
danger
john
bull
has
to
use
the
same
old
argument
as
john
ball
he
tells
lady
clara
vere
de
vere
that
gardener
adam
and
his
wife
smile
at
the
claim
of
long
descent
their
own
descent
being
by
no
means
long
lady
clara
might
surely
have
scored
off
him
pretty
smartly
by
quoting
from
and
memoriam
about
evolution
and
the
eft
that
was
lord
of
valley
and
hill
but
tennyson
has
evidently
forgotten
all
about
darwin
and
the
long
descent
of
man
if
this
was
true
of
an
evolutionist
like
tennyson
it
was
naturally
ten
times
truer
of
a
revolutionist
like
jefferson
the
declaration
of
independence
dogmatically
bases
all
rights
on
the
fact
that
god
created
all
men
equal
and
it
is
right
for
if
they
were
not
created
equal
they
were
certainly
evolved
unequal
there
is
no
basis
for
democracy
except
in
a
dogma
about
the
divine
origin
of
man
that
is
a
perfectly
simple
fact
which
the
modern
world
will
find
out
more
and
more
to
be
a
fact
every
other
basis
is
a
sort
of
sentimental
confusion
full
of
merely
verbal
echoes
of
the
older
creeds
those
verbal
associations
are
always
vain
for
the
vital
purpose
of
constraining
the
tyrant
an
idealist
may
say
to
a
capitalist
you
sometimes
feel
in
the
rich
twilight
when
the
lights
twinkle
from
the
distant
hamlet
in
the
hills
that
all
humanity
is
a
holy
family
but
it
is
equally
possible
for
the
capitalist
to
reply
with
brevity
and
decision
i
do
and
there
is
no
more
disputing
about
it
further
than
about
the
beauty
of
a
fading
cloud
and
the
modern
world
of
moods
is
a
world
of
clouds
even
if
some
of
them
are
thunderclouds
for
i
have
only
taken
here
as
a
convenient
working
model
the
case
of
negro
slavery
because
it
was
long
peculiar
to
america
and
is
popularly
associated
with
it
it
is
more
and
more
obvious
that
the
line
is
no
longer
running
between
black
and
white
but
between
rich
and
poor
as
i
have
already
noted
in
the
case
of
prohibition
the
very
same
arguments
of
the
inevitable
suicide
of
the
ignorant
of
the
impossibility
of
freedom
for
the
unfit
which
were
once
applied
to
barbarians
brought
from
africa
are
now
applied
to
citizens
born
in
america
it
is
argued
even
by
industrialists
that
industrialism
has
produced
a
class
submerged
below
the
status
of
emancipated
mankind
they
imply
that
the
missing
link
is
no
longer
missing
even
from
england
or
the
northern
states
and
that
the
factories
have
manufactured
their
own
monkeys
scientific
hypotheses
about
the
and
the
criminal
type
will
supply
the
masters
of
the
modern
world
with
more
and
more
excuses
for
denying
the
dogma
of
equality
in
the
case
of
white
labour
as
well
as
black
and
any
man
who
knows
the
world
knows
perfectly
well
that
to
tell
the
millionaires
or
their
servants
that
they
are
disappointing
the
sentiments
of
thomas
jefferson
or
disregarding
a
creed
composed
in
the
eighteenth
century
will
be
about
as
effective
as
telling
them
that
they
are
not
observing
the
creed
of
athanasius
or
keeping
the
rule
of
benedict
the
world
can
not
keep
its
own
ideals
the
secular
order
can
not
make
secure
any
one
of
its
own
noble
and
natural
conceptions
of
secular
perfection
that
will
be
found
as
time
goes
on
the
ultimate
argument
for
a
church
independent
of
the
world
and
the
secular
order
what
has
become
of
all
those
ideal
figures
from
the
wise
man
of
the
stoics
to
the
democratic
deist
of
the
eighteenth
century
what
has
become
of
all
that
purely
human
hierarchy
of
chivalry
with
its
punctilious
pattern
of
the
good
knight
its
ardent
ambition
in
the
young
squire
the
very
name
of
knight
has
come
to
represent
the
petty
triumph
of
a
profiteer
and
the
very
word
squire
the
petty
tyranny
of
a
landlord
what
has
become
of
all
that
golden
liberality
of
the
humanists
who
found
on
the
high
tablelands
of
the
culture
of
hellas
the
very
balance
of
repose
in
beauty
that
is
most
lacking
in
the
modern
world
the
very
greek
language
that
they
loved
has
become
a
mere
label
for
snuffy
and
snobbish
dons
and
a
mere
for
cheap
and
utilitarians
who
make
it
a
symbol
of
superstition
and
reaction
we
have
lived
to
see
a
time
when
the
heroic
legend
of
the
republic
and
the
citizen
which
seemed
to
jefferson
the
eternal
youth
of
the
world
has
begun
to
grow
old
in
its
turn
we
can
not
recover
the
earthly
estate
of
knighthood
to
which
all
the
colours
and
complications
of
heraldry
seemed
as
fresh
and
natural
as
flowers
we
can
not
the
intellectual
experiences
of
the
humanists
for
whom
the
greek
grammar
was
like
the
song
of
a
bird
in
spring
the
more
the
matter
is
considered
the
clearer
it
will
seem
that
these
old
experiences
are
now
only
alive
where
they
have
found
a
lodgment
in
the
catholic
tradition
of
christendom
and
made
themselves
friends
for
ever
francis
is
the
only
surviving
troubadour
thomas
more
is
the
only
surviving
humanist
louis
is
the
only
surviving
knight
it
would
be
the
worst
sort
of
insincerity
therefore
to
conclude
even
so
hazy
an
outline
of
so
great
and
majestic
a
matter
as
the
american
democratic
experiment
without
testifying
my
belief
that
to
this
also
the
same
ultimate
test
will
come
so
far
as
that
democracy
becomes
or
remains
catholic
and
christian
that
democracy
will
remain
democratic
in
so
far
as
it
does
not
it
will
become
wildly
and
wickedly
undemocratic
its
rich
will
riot
with
a
brutal
indifference
far
beyond
the
feeble
feudalism
which
retains
some
shadow
of
responsibility
or
at
least
of
patronage
its
will
either
sink
into
heathen
slavery
or
seek
relief
in
theories
that
are
destructive
not
merely
in
method
but
in
aim
since
they
are
but
the
negations
of
the
human
appetites
of
property
and
personality
ideals
formulated
in
language
have
no
longer
in
themselves
the
power
to
hold
all
those
pagan
passions
back
even
those
documents
depended
upon
deism
their
real
strength
will
survive
in
men
who
are
still
deists
and
the
men
who
are
still
deists
are
more
than
deists
men
will
more
and
more
realise
that
there
is
no
meaning
in
democracy
if
there
is
no
meaning
in
anything
and
that
there
is
no
meaning
in
anything
if
the
universe
has
not
a
centre
of
significance
and
an
authority
that
is
the
author
of
our
rights
there
is
truth
in
every
ancient
fable
and
there
is
here
even
something
of
it
in
the
fancy
that
finds
the
symbol
of
the
republic
in
the
bird
that
bore
the
bolts
of
jove
owls
and
bats
may
wander
where
they
will
in
darkness
and
for
them
as
for
the
sceptics
the
universe
may
have
no
centre
kites
and
vultures
may
linger
as
they
like
over
carrion
and
for
them
as
for
the
plutocrats
existence
may
have
no
origin
and
no
end
but
it
was
far
back
in
the
land
of
legends
where
instincts
find
their
true
images
that
the
cry
went
forth
that
freedom
is
an
eagle
whose
glory
is
gazing
at
the
sun
