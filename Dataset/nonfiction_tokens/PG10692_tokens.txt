a

of

robert
edward
lee
part
i
early
i
introduction
the
name
of
lee
is
beloved
and
respected
throughout
the
world
men
of
all
parties
and
opinions
unite
in
this
sentiment
not
only
those
who
thought
and
fought
with
him
but
those
most
violently
opposed
to
his
political
views
and
career
it
is
natural
that
his
own
people
should
love
and
honor
him
as
their
great
leader
and
defender
in
a
struggle
of
intense
bitterness
that
his
old
enemies
should
share
this
profound
regard
and
admiration
is
due
solely
to
the
character
of
the
individual
his
military
genius
will
always
be
conceded
and
his
figure
remain
a
conspicuous
landmark
in
history
but
this
does
not
account
for
the
fact
that
his
very
enemies
love
the
man
his
private
character
is
the
origin
of
this
sentiment
the
people
of
the
north
no
less
than
the
people
of
the
south
feel
that
lee
was
truly
great
and
the
harshest
critic
has
been
able
to
find
nothing
to
detract
from
this
view
of
him
the
soldier
was
great
but
the
man
himself
was
greater
no
one
was
ever
simpler
truer
or
more
honest
those
who
knew
him
best
loved
him
the
most
reserved
and
silent
with
a
bearing
of
almost
austere
dignity
he
impressed
many
persons
as
cold
and
unsympathetic
and
his
true
character
was
long
in
revealing
itself
to
the
world
all
men
know
what
his
friends
knew
during
his
life
that
under
the
grave
exterior
of
the
soldier
oppressed
with
care
and
anxiety
beat
a
warm
and
kindly
heart
full
of
an
even
extraordinary
gentleness
and
sweetness
that
the
man
himself
was
not
cold
or
stiff
or
harsh
but
patient
forbearing
charitable
under
many
trials
of
his
equanimity
and
magnanimous
without
effort
from
the
native
impulse
of
his
heart
friend
and
foe
thus
regard
him
with
much
the
same
sentiment
as
a
genuinely
honest
man
incapable
of
duplicity
in
thought
or
deed
wholly
good
and
sincere
inspired
always
under
all
temptations
by
that
which
purifies
and
ennobles
and
resolutely
bent
in
the
dark
hour
as
in
the
bright
on
the
full
performance
of
his
duty
duty
is
the
sublimest
word
in
our
language
he
wrote
to
his
son
and
if
we
add
that
other
august
maxim
human
virtue
should
be
equal
to
human
calamity
we
shall
have
in
a
few
words
a
summary
of
the
principles
which
inspired
lee
the
crowning
grace
of
this
man
who
was
thus
not
only
great
but
good
was
the
humility
and
trust
in
god
which
lay
at
the
foundation
of
his
character
upon
this
point
we
shall
quote
the
words
of
a
gentleman
of
commanding
intellect
a
bitter
opponent
of
the
south
in
the
war
lee
is
worthy
of
all
praise
as
a
man
he
was
fearless
among
men
as
a
soldier
he
had
no
superior
and
no
equal
in
the
course
of
nature
my
career
on
earth
may
soon
terminate
god
grant
that
when
the
day
of
my
death
shall
come
i
may
look
up
to
heaven
with
that
confidence
and
faith
which
the
life
and
character
of
robert
lee
gave
him
he
died
trusting
in
god
as
a
good
man
with
a
good
life
and
a
pure
conscience
he
had
lived
as
he
died
with
this
supreme
trust
in
an
overruling
and
merciful
providence
and
this
sentiment
pervading
his
whole
being
was
the
origin
of
that
august
calmness
with
which
he
greeted
the
most
crushing
disasters
of
his
military
career
his
faith
and
humble
trust
sustained
him
after
the
war
when
the
woes
of
the
south
wellnigh
broke
his
great
spirit
and
he
calmly
expired
as
a
weary
child
falls
asleep
knowing
that
its
father
is
near
of
this
eminent
soldier
and
man
whose
character
offers
so
great
an
example
a
memoir
is
attempted
in
this
volume
the
work
will
necessarily
be
popular
rather
than
full
and
elaborate
as
the
public
and
private
correspondence
of
lee
are
not
at
this
time
accessible
these
will
throw
a
fuller
light
on
the
subject
but
sufficient
material
is
at
the
disposal
of
the
writer
to
enable
him
to
present
an
accurate
likeness
of
lee
and
to
narrate
clearly
the
incidents
of
his
career
in
doing
so
the
aim
of
the
author
is
to
measure
out
full
justice
to
all
not
to
arouse
old
enmities
which
should
be
allowed
to
slumber
but
to
treat
his
subject
with
the
judicial
moderation
of
the
student
of
history
a
few
words
will
terminate
this
preface
the
volume
before
the
reader
was
begun
in
the
writer
first
however
informed
general
lee
of
his
design
and
had
the
honor
to
receive
from
him
in
reply
the
assurance
that
the
work
would
not
interfere
with
any
he
might
have
in
contemplation
he
had
not
written
a
line
of
any
work
as
yet
and
might
never
do
so
but
should
he
write
a
history
of
the
campaigns
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
the
proposed
work
would
be
rather
an
assistance
than
a
hinderance
as
the
writer
had
offered
promptly
to
discontinue
the
work
if
it
were
not
agreeable
to
general
lee
this
reply
was
regarded
in
the
light
of
an
assurance
that
he
did
not
disapprove
of
it
the
composition
was
however
interrupted
and
the
work
laid
aside
it
is
now
resumed
and
completed
at
a
time
when
the
death
of
the
illustrious
soldier
adds
a
new
and
absorbing
interest
to
whatever
is
connected
with
his
character
or
career
ii
the
lees
of
virginia
the
lees
of
virginia
spring
from
an
ancient
and
respectable
family
of
essex
in
england
of
some
members
of
the
family
both
in
the
old
world
and
the
new
a
brief
account
will
be
given
the
origin
of
an
individual
explains
much
that
is
striking
and
peculiar
in
his
own
character
and
it
will
be
found
that
general
lee
inherited
many
of
the
traits
of
his
ancestors
especially
of
some
eminent
personages
of
his
name
in
virginia
the
family
pedigree
is
traced
back
by
lee
in
the
life
of
his
father
to
launcelot
lee
of
london
in
france
who
accompanied
william
the
conqueror
to
england
after
the
battle
of
hastings
which
subjected
england
to
the
sway
of
the
normans
launcelot
lee
like
others
was
rewarded
by
lands
wrested
from
the
subdued
saxons
his
estate
lay
in
essex
and
this
is
all
that
is
known
concerning
him
lionel
lee
is
the
next
member
of
the
family
of
whom
mention
is
made
he
lived
during
the
reign
of
richard
coeur
de
lion
and
when
the
king
went
on
his
third
crusade
in
the
year
lionel
lee
raised
a
company
of
gentlemen
and
marched
with
him
to
the
holy
land
his
career
there
was
distinguished
he
displayed
special
gallantry
at
the
siege
of
acre
and
for
this
he
received
a
solid
proof
of
king
richard
approbation
on
his
return
he
was
made
first
earl
of
litchfield
the
king
presented
him
with
the
estate
of
ditchley
which
became
the
name
afterward
of
an
estate
of
the
lees
in
virginia
and
when
he
died
the
armor
which
he
had
worn
in
the
holy
land
was
placed
in
the
department
of
horse
armory
in
the
great
tower
of
london
the
name
of
richard
lee
is
next
mentioned
as
one
of
the
followers
of
the
earl
of
surrey
in
his
expedition
across
the
scottish
border
in
two
of
the
family
about
this
period
were
knights
companions
of
the
garter
and
their
banners
with
the
lee
arms
above
were
suspended
in
george
chapel
in
windsor
castle
the
was
a
shield
band
sinister
battled
and
embattled
the
crest
a
closed
visor
surmounted
by
a
squirrel
holding
a
nut
the
motto
which
may
be
thought
characteristic
of
one
of
general
lee
traits
as
a
soldier
was
incautus
such
are
the
brief
notices
given
of
the
family
in
england
they
seem
to
have
been
persons
of
high
character
and
often
of
distinction
when
richard
lee
came
to
virginia
and
founded
the
family
anew
there
as
launcelot
the
first
lee
had
founded
it
in
england
he
brought
over
in
his
veins
some
of
the
best
and
most
valiant
blood
of
the
great
norman
race
this
richard
lee
the
of
the
family
in
virginia
was
it
seems
like
the
rest
of
his
kindred
strongly
cavalier
in
his
sentiments
indeed
the
lees
seem
always
to
have
been
cavalier
the
reader
will
recall
the
stately
old
representative
of
the
family
in
scott
woodstock
sir
henry
lee
of
ditchley
who
is
seen
stalking
proudly
through
the
great
apartments
of
the
palace
in
his
laced
doublet
slashed
boots
and
velvet
cloak
scowling
darkly
at
the
puritan
intruders
sir
henry
was
not
a
fanciful
person
but
a
real
individual
and
the
political
views
attributed
to
him
were
those
of
the
lee
family
who
remained
faithful
to
the
royal
cause
in
all
its
hours
of
adversity
it
will
be
seen
that
richard
lee
the
first
of
the
virginia
lees
was
an
ardent
monarchist
he
came
over
during
the
reign
of
charles
but
returned
to
england
bequeathing
all
his
lands
to
his
servants
he
subsequently
came
back
to
virginia
however
and
lived
and
died
there
in
his
will
he
styles
himself
richard
lee
of
strafford
langton
in
the
county
of
essex
esquire
it
is
not
certainly
known
whether
he
sought
refuge
in
virginia
after
the
failure
of
the
king
cause
or
was
tempted
to
emigrate
with
a
view
to
better
his
fortunes
in
the
new
world
either
may
have
been
the
impelling
motive
great
numbers
of
cavaliers
came
over
after
the
overthrow
of
charles
at
naseby
but
a
large
emigration
had
already
taken
place
and
took
place
afterward
induced
by
the
salubrity
of
the
country
the
ease
of
living
and
the
cheapness
and
fertility
of
the
lands
on
the
great
rivers
where
families
impoverished
or
of
failing
fortunes
in
england
might
make
new
settlements
and
build
on
a
new
foundation
this
would
amply
account
for
the
removal
of
richard
lee
to
virginia
and
for
the
ambition
he
seems
to
have
been
inspired
with
to
build
and
improve
without
attributing
to
him
any
apprehension
of
probable
punishment
for
his
political
course
very
many
families
had
the
motives
and
commenced
to
build
great
which
were
never
finished
or
were
too
costly
for
any
one
of
their
descendants
to
possess
the
abolition
of
primogeniture
despite
the
opposition
of
pendleton
and
others
overthrew
all
this
and
the
lees
like
other
families
now
possess
few
of
the
broad
acres
which
their
ancestors
acquired
to
return
however
to
richard
lee
he
had
already
visited
virginia
in
some
official
capacity
under
the
royal
governor
sir
william
berkeley
and
had
been
so
much
pleased
with
the
soil
and
climate
of
the
country
that
he
as
we
have
said
emigrated
finally
and
cast
his
lot
in
the
new
land
he
brought
a
number
of
followers
and
servants
and
coming
over
to
westmoreland
county
in
the
northern
neck
of
virginia
took
up
extensive
tracts
of
land
there
and
set
about
building
upon
them
among
these
it
is
stated
was
the
original
stratford
house
afterward
destroyed
by
fire
it
was
rebuilt
however
and
became
the
birthplace
of
richard
henry
lee
and
afterward
of
general
robert
lee
we
shall
speak
of
it
more
in
detail
after
finishing
in
a
few
words
our
notice
of
richard
lee
its
founder
and
the
founder
of
the
lee
family
in
virginia
he
is
described
as
a
person
of
great
force
of
character
and
many
virtues
as
a
man
of
good
stature
comely
visage
enterprising
genius
sound
head
vigorous
spirit
and
generous
nature
this
may
be
suspected
to
partake
of
the
nature
of
epitaph
but
of
his
courage
and
energy
the
proof
remains
in
the
action
taken
by
him
in
connection
with
charles
ii
inheriting
it
would
seem
in
full
measure
the
royalist
and
cavalier
sentiments
of
his
family
he
united
with
sir
william
berkeley
the
royal
governor
in
the
irregular
proclamation
of
charles
ii
in
virginia
a
year
or
two
before
his
reinstallment
on
the
english
throne
he
had
already
it
is
reported
on
the
authority
of
tradition
made
a
voyage
across
the
atlantic
to
breda
where
charles
ii
was
then
in
exile
and
offered
to
erect
his
standard
in
virginia
and
proclaim
him
king
there
this
proposition
the
young
monarch
declined
shrinking
with
excellent
good
sense
from
a
renewal
under
less
favorable
circumstances
of
the
struggle
which
terminated
at
worcester
lee
was
therefore
compelled
to
return
without
having
succeeded
in
his
enterprise
but
he
had
made
it
seems
a
very
strong
impression
in
favor
of
virginia
upon
the
somewhat
frivolous
young
monarch
when
he
came
to
his
throne
again
charles
ii
graciously
wore
a
of
virginia
silk
and
virginia
who
had
proved
so
faithful
to
him
in
the
hour
of
his
need
was
authorized
by
royal
decree
to
rank
thenceforward
in
the
british
empire
with
england
scotland
and
ireland
and
bear
upon
her
shield
the
motto
dat
virginia
richard
lee
returned
after
his
unsuccessful
mission
to
the
northern
neck
and
addressed
himself
thenceforward
to
the
management
of
his
private
fortunes
and
the
affairs
of
the
colony
he
had
now
become
possessed
of
very
extensive
estates
between
the
potomac
and
rappahannock
rivers
and
elsewhere
besides
stratford
he
owned
plantations
called
mocke
neck
mathotick
neck
war
captain
neck
bishop
neck
and
paradise
with
four
thousand
acres
besides
on
the
potomac
lands
in
maryland
three
islands
in
chesapeake
bay
an
interest
in
several
and
innumerable
indented
and
other
servants
he
became
a
member
of
the
king
council
and
lived
in
great
elegance
and
comfort
that
he
was
a
man
of
high
character
and
of
notable
piety
for
an
age
of
free
living
and
worldly
tendencies
his

in
that

me
and
to
my
blessed
redeemer
jesus

assuredly
trusting
in
and
by
his
meritorious
death
and
passion
to
receive
salvation
the
attention
of
the
reader
has
been
particularly
called
to
the
character
and
career
of
richard
lee
not
only
because
he
was
the
founder
of
the
family
in
virginia
but
because
the
traits
of
the
individual
reappear
very
prominently
in
the
great
soldier
whose
life
is
the
subject
of
this
volume
the
coolness
courage
energy
and
aptitude
for
great
affairs
which
marked
richard
lee
in
the
seventeenth
century
were
unmistakably
present
in
the
character
of
robert
lee
in
the
nineteenth
century
we
shall
conclude
our
notice
of
the
family
by
calling
attention
to
that
great
group
of
celebrated
men
who
illustrated
the
name
in
the
days
of
the
revolution
and
exhibited
the
family
characteristics
as
clearly
these
were
richard
henry
lee
of
chantilly
the
famous
orator
and
statesman
who
moved
in
the
american
congress
the
declaration
of
independence
francis
lightfoot
lee
a
scholar
of
elegant
attainments
and
high
literary
accomplishments
who
signed
with
his
more
renowned
brother
the
declaration
william
lee
who
became
sheriff
of
london
and
ably
seconded
the
cause
of
the
colonies
and
arthur
lee
diplomatist
and
representative
of
america
abroad
where
he
displayed
as
his
diplomatic
correspondence
indicates
untiring
energy
and
devotion
to
the
interests
of
the
colonies
the
last
of
these
brothers
was
philip
ludwell
lee
whose
daughter
matilda
married
her
second
cousin
general
henry
lee
this
gentleman
afterward
famous
as
harry
lee
married
a
second
time
and
from
this
union
sprung
the
subject
of
this
memoir
iii
general
harry
lee
this
celebrated
soldier
who
so
largely
occupied
the
public
eye
in
the
revolution
is
worthy
of
notice
both
as
an
eminent
member
of
the
lee
family
and
as
the
father
of
general
robert
lee
he
was
born
in
in
the
county
of
westmoreland
which
boasts
of
being
the
birthplace
of
washington
monroe
richard
henry
lee
general
henry
lee
and
general
robert
lee
presidents
statesmen
and
soldiers
and
after
graduating
at
princeton
college
entered
the
army
in
as
captain
of
cavalry
an
arm
of
the
service
afterward
adopted
by
his
more
celebrated
descendant
in
the
united
states
army
he
soon
displayed
military
ability
of
high
order
and
for
the
capture
of
paulus
hook
received
a
gold
medal
from
congress
in
he
marched
with
his
legion
to
join
greene
in
the
carolinas
carrying
with
him
the
high
esteem
of
washington
who
had
witnessed
his
skilful
and
daring
operations
in
the
jerseys
his
career
in
the
arduous
campaigns
of
the
south
against
cornwallis
and
the
efficient
commander
of
his
cavalry
arm
colonel
tarleton
may
be
best
understood
from
general
greene
dispatches
and
from
his
own
memoirs
of
the
operations
of
the
army
which
are
written
with
as
much
modesty
as
ability
from
these
it
is
apparent
that
the
small
body
of
the
legion
cavalry
under
its
active
and
daring
commander
was
the
eye
and
ear
of
greene
army
whose
movements
it
accompanied
everywhere
preceding
its
advances
and
covering
its
retreats
few
pages
of
military
history
are
more
stirring
than
those
in
lee
memoirs
describing
retrograde
movement
to
the
dan
and
this
alone
if
the
hard
work
at
the
eutaws
and
elsewhere
were
left
out
would
place
lee
fame
as
a
cavalry
officer
upon
a
lasting
basis
the
distinguished
soldier
under
whose
eye
the
virginian
operated
did
full
justice
to
his
courage
and
capacity
i
believe
wrote
greene
that
few
officers
either
in
europe
or
america
are
held
in
so
high
a
position
of
admiration
as
you
are
everybody
knows
i
have
the
highest
opinion
of
you
as
an
officer
and
you
know
i
love
you
as
a
friend
no
man
in
the
progress
of
the
campaign
had
equal
merit
with
yourself
the
officer
who
wrote
those
lines
was
not
a
courtier
nor
a
diplomatist
but
a
blunt
and
honest
soldier
who
had
seen
lee
bearing
in
the
most
arduous
straits
and
was
capable
of
appreciating
military
ability
add
expression
of
his
love
and
thanks
in
a
letter
written
in
and
the
light
in
which
he
was
regarded
by
his
contemporaries
will
be
understood
his
memoirs
of
the
war
in
the
southern
department
is
a
valuable
military
history
and
a
very
interesting
book
the
movements
of
greene
in
face
of
cornwallis
are
described
with
a
precision
which
renders
the
narrative
valuable
to
military
students
and
a
picturesqueness
which
rivets
the
attention
of
the
general
reader
from
these
memoirs
a
very
clear
conception
of
the
writer
character
may
be
derived
and
everywhere
in
them
is
felt
the
presence
of
a
cool
and
dashing
nature
a
man
gifted
with
the
aequa
in
whom
no
reverse
of
fortune
could
cast
down
the
fairness
and
courtesy
of
the
writer
toward
his
opponents
is
an
attractive
characteristic
of
the
work
which
is
written
with
a
simplicity
and
directness
of
style
highly
agreeable
to
readers
of
judgment
footnote
see
his
observations
upon
the
source
of
his
successes
over
tarleton
full
of
the
generous
spirit
of
a
great
soldier
he
attributes
them
in
no
degree
to
his
own
military
ability
but
to
the
superior
character
of
his
large
horses
which
rode
over
tarleton
inferior
stock
he
does
not
state
that
the
famous
legion
numbered
only
two
hundred

that

commanded
a
much

the

the
narrative

stormy
scenes

his
let
us
pause
a
moment
and
bestow
a
glance
upon
this
ancient
mansion
which
is
still
standing
a
silent
and
melancholy
relic
of
the
past
in
the
remote
northern
neck
as
the
birthplace
of
a
great
man
it
would
demand
attention
but
it
has
other
claims
still
as
a
venerable
memorial
of
the
past
and
its
eminent
personages
one
of
the
few
remaining
monuments
of
a
state
of
society
that
has
disappeared
or
is
disappearing
the
original
stratford
house
is
supposed
as
we
have
said
to
have
been
built
by
richard
lee
the
first
of
the
family
in
the
new
world
whoever
may
have
been
its
founder
it
was
destroyed
in
the
time
of
thomas
lee
an
eminent
representative
of
the
name
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
thomas
lee
was
a
member
of
the
king
council
a
gentleman
of
great
popularity
and
when
it
was
known
that
his
house
had
been
burned
contributions
were
everywhere
made
to
rebuild
it
the
governor
the
merchants
of
the
colony
and
even
queen
anne
in
person
united
in
this
subscription
the
house
speedily
rose
again
at
a
cost
of
about
eighty
thousand
dollars
and
this
is
the
edifice
still
standing
in
westmoreland
the
sum
expended
in
its
construction
must
not
be
estimated
in
the
light
of
at
that
time
the
greater
part
of
the
heavy
work
in
was
performed
by
servants
of
the
manor
it
is
fair
indeed
to
say
that
the
larger
part
of
the
work
thus
cost
nothing
in
money
and
thus
the
eighty
thousand
dollars
represented
only
the
english
brick
the
carvings
furniture
and
decorations
the
construction
of
such
an
edifice
had
at
that
day
a
distinct
object
these
great
old
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
country
were
intended
to
become
the
headquarters
of
the
family
in
all
time
in
their
large
apartments
the
eldest
son
was
to
uphold
the
name
generation
after
generation
was
to
pass
and
some
one
of
the
old
name
still
live
there
and
though
all
this
has
passed
away
now
and
may
appear
a
superstition
and
though
some
persons
may
stigmatize
it
as
contributing
to
the
sentiment
of
aristocracy
the
strongest
opponents
of
that
old
system
may
pardon
in
us
the
expression
of
some
regret
that
this
love
of
the
hearthstone
and
old
family
memories
should
have
disappeared
the
great
man
whose
character
is
sought
to
be
delineated
in
this
volume
never
lost
to
the
last
this
home
and
family
sentiment
he
knew
the
kinships
of
every
one
and
loved
the
old
of
the
old
virginia
families
plain
and
honest
people
attached
like
himself
to
the
virginia
soil
we
pass
to
a
brief
description
of
the
old
house
in
which
lee
was
born
stratford
the
old
home
of
the
lees
but
the
property
of
others
stands
on
a
picturesque
bluff
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
potomac
and
is
a
house
of
very
considerable
size
it
is
built
in
the
form
of
the
letter
the
walls
are
several
feet
in
thickness
in
the
centre
is
a
saloon
thirty
feet
in
size
and
surmounting
each
wing
is
a
pavilion
with
balustrades
above
which
rise
clusters
of
chimneys
the
front
door
is
reached
by
a
broad
flight
of
steps
and
the
grounds
are
handsome
and
variegated
by
the
bright
foliage
of
oaks
cedars
and
here
and
there
in
the
extensive
lawn
rises
a
slender
and
ghostly
old
lombardy
poplar
a
tree
once
a
great
favorite
in
virginia
but
now
seen
only
here
and
there
the
relic
of
a
past
generation
within
the
stratford
house
is
as
antique
as
without
and
with
its
halls
corridors
wainscoting
and
ancient
mouldings
takes
the
visitor
back
to
the
era
of
powder
and
silk
stockings
such
was
the
mansion
to
which
general
harry
lee
came
to
live
after
the
revolution
and
the
sight
of
the
old
home
must
have
been
dear
to
the
heart
here
had
flourished
three
generations
of
lees
dispensing
a
profuse
and
hospitality
in
each
generation
some
one
of
the
family
had
distinguished
himself
and
attracted
the
best
company
to
stratford
the
old
walls
had
rung
with
merriment
the
great
door
was
wide
open
everybody
was
welcome
and
one
could
see
there
a
good
illustration
of
a
manner
of
living
which
had
at
least
the
merit
of
being
hearty
and
picturesque
general
harry
lee
the
careless
soldier
partook
of
the
family
tendency
to
hospitality
he
kept
open
house
entertained
all
comers
and
hence
doubtless
sprung
the
pecuniary
embarrassments
embittering
an
old
age
which
his
eminent
public
services
should
have
rendered
serene
and
happy
our
notice
of
stratford
may
appear
unduly
long
to
some
readers
but
it
is
not
without
a
distinct
reference
to
the
subject
of
this
volume
in
this
quiet
old
mansion
and
in
the
very
apartment
where
richard
henry
and
francis
lightfoot
lee
first
saw
the
light
robert
lee
was
born
the
eyes
of
the
child
fell
first
upon
the
old
apartments
the
great
grounds
the
homely
scenes
around
the
old
upon
the
tall
lombardy
poplars
and
the
oaks
through
which
passed
the
wind
bearing
to
his
ears
the
murmur
of
the
potomac
he
left
the
old
home
of
his
family
before
it
could
have
had
any
very
great
effect
upon
him
it
would
seem
but
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
these
first
influences
to
decide
the
depth
of
the
impression
which
the
child
heart
is
capable
of
receiving
the
bright
eyes
of
young
robert
lee
must
have
seen
much
around
him
to
interest
him
and
shape
his
first
views
critics
charged
him
with
family
pride
sometimes
if
he
possessed
that
virtue
or
failing
the
fact
was
not
strange
stratford
opened
before
his
childish
eyes
a
memorial
of
the
old
splendor
of
the
lees
he
saw
around
him
old
portraits
old
plate
and
old
furniture
telling
plainly
of
the
ancient
origin
and
high
position
of
his
family
old
parchments
contained
histories
of
the
deeds
of
his
race
old
genealogical
trees
traced
their
line
far
back
into
the
past
old
servants
grown
gray
in
the
house
waited
upon
the
child
and
in
a
corner
of
one
of
the
great
apartments
an
old
soldier
gray
too
and
shattered
in
health
once
the
friend
of
washington
and
greene
was
writing
the
history
of
the
battles
in
which
he
had
drawn
his
sword
for
his
native
land
amid
these
scenes
and
surroundings
passed
the
first
years
of
robert
lee
they
must
have
made
their
impression
upon
his
character
at
a
period
when
the
mind
takes
every
new
influence
and
grows
in
accordance
with
it
and
to
the
last
the
man
remained
simple
hearty
proud
courteous
the
in
all
the
texture
of
his
character
he
always
rejoiced
to
visit
the
country
loved
horses
was
an
excellent
rider
was
fond
of
plain
country
talk
jests
humorous
anecdote
and
was
the
plain
country
gentleman
in
a
word
preferring
grass
and
trees
and
streams
to
all
the
cities
and
crowds
in
the
world
in
the
last
year
of
his
life
he
said
to
a
lady
my
visits
to
florida
and
the
white
sulphur
have
not
benefited
me
much
but
it
did
me
good
to
go
to
the
white
house
and
see
mules
walking
round
and
the
corn
we
notice
a
last
result
of
the
child
residence
now
or
visits
afterward
to
the
country
and
the
sports
in
which
he
indulged
the
superb
physical
health
and
strength
which
remained
unshaken
afterward
by
all
the
hardships
of
war
lee
to
the
last
was
a
marvel
of
sound
physical
development
his
frame
was
as
solid
as
oak
and
stood
the
strain
of
exhausting
marches
loss
of
sleep
hunger
thirst
heat
and
cold
without
failing
him
when
he
died
it
was
care
which
crushed
his
heart
his
health
was
perfect
lee
early
manhood
and
career
in
the
united
states
army
of
lee
childhood
we
have
no
memorials
except
the
words
of
his
father
long
afterward
was
always
wrote
general
henry
lee
footnote
to
lee
february
that
is
all
but
the
words
indicate
much
that
the
good
man
was
always
good
it
will
be
seen
that
when
he
went
to
west
point
he
never
received
a
demerit
the
good
boy
was
the
good
young
officer
and
became
in
due
time
the
good
in
the
year
general
henry
lee
left
stratford
and
removed
with
his
family
to
alexandria
actuated
it
seems
by
the
desire
of
affording
his
children
facilities
for
gaining
their
education
after
his
death
in
lee
continued
to
reside
in
alexandria
was
a
communicant
of
christ
church
and
her
children
were
taught
the
episcopal
catechism
by
young
william
meade
eventually
bishop
of
virginia
we
shall
see
how
bishop
meade
long
afterward
recalled
those
early
days
when
he
and
his
pupil
young
robert
lee
were
equally
unknown
how
when
about
to
die
just
as
the
war
began
in
earnest
he
sent
for
the
boy
he
had
once
instructed
now
the
soldier
and
when
he
came
to
the
bedside
exclaimed
god
bless
you
robert
i
ca
call
you
i
have
heard
you
your
catechism
too
often
alexandria
continued
to
be
the
residence
of
the
family
until
the
young
man
was
eighteen
years
of
age
when
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
make
choice
of

obtained
the
appointment
and
in
at
the
age
of
eighteen
entered
the
military
academy
his
progress
in
his
studies
was
steady
and
it
is
said
that
during
his
stay
at
west
point
he
was
never
reprimanded
nor
marked
with
a
demerit
he
graduated
in

he
is
described
by
those
who
saw
him
at
this
time
as
a
young
man
of
great
personal
beauty
and
this
is
probably
not
an
exaggeration
as
he
remained
to
the
last
distinguished
for
the
elegance
and
dignity
of
his
person
he
had
not
yet
lost
what
the
cares
of
command
afterward
banished
his
gayety
and
and
was
noted
it
is
said
for
the
sweetness
of
his
smile
and
the
cordiality
of
his
manners
the
person
who
gave
the
writer
these
details
added
he
was
a
perfect
gentleman
three
years
after
graduating
at

he
married

known
in
the

the
life
of
lee
up
to
the
beginning
of
the
great
conflict
of
is
of
moderate
interest
only
and
we
shall
not
dwell
at
length
upon
it
he
was
employed
on
the
coast
defences
in
new
york
and
virginia
and
in
in
running
the
boundary
line
between
the
states
of

and

in
september
he
was
promoted
to
the
rank
of
first
lieutenant
in
july
to
a
captaincy
in
he
became
a
member
of
the
board
of
visitors
to
the
military
academy
in
he
was
a
member
of
the
board
of
engineers
and
in
when
the
mexican
war
broke
out
was
assigned
to
duty
as
chief
engineer
of
the
central
army
of
mexico
in
which
capacity
he
served
to
the
end
of
the
war
up
to
the
date
of
the
mexican
war
captain
lee
had
attracted
no
public
attention
but
had
impressed
the
military
authorities
including
general
winfield
scott
with
a
favorable
opinion
of
his
ability
as
a
topographical
engineer
for
this
department
of
military
science
he
exhibited
endowments
of
the
first
class
what
other
faculties
of
the
soldier
he
possessed
it
remained
for
events
to
show
this
opportunity
was
now
given
him
in
the
mexican
war
and
the
efficient
character
of
his
services
may
be
seen
in
scott
autobiography
where
captain
lee
of
the
engineers
is
mentioned
in
every
report
and
everywhere
with
commendation
from
the
beginning
of
operations
the
young
officer
seems
to
have
been
summoned
to
the
councils
of
war
and
general
scott
particularly
mentions
that
held
at
vera
cruz
so
serious
an
affair
that
a
discussion
could
hardly
have
been
more
solemn
the
passages
in
which
the
mentions
lee
are
too
numerous
and
not
of
sufficient
interest
to
quote
but
two
entries
will
exhibit
the
general
tenor
of
this
honorable
mention
after
cerro
gordo
scott
writes
in
his
official
report
of
the
battle
i
am
compelled
to
make
special
mention
of
captain
lee
engineer
this
officer
greatly
distinguished
himself
at
the
siege
of
vera
cruz
was
again
indefatigable
during
these
operations
in
reconnoissance
as
daring
as
laborious
and
of
the
utmost
value
after
chapultepec
he
wrote
captain
lee
so
constantly
distinguished
also
bore
important
orders
for
me
september
until
he
fainted
from
a
wound
and
the
loss
of
two
nights
sleep
at
the
batteries
we
may
add
here
the
statement
of
the
hon
reverdy
johnson
that
he
had
heard
general
scott
more
than
once
say
that
his
success
in
mexico
was
largely
due
to
the
skill
valor
and
undaunted
energy
of
robert
e
lee
for
these
services
lee
received
steady
promotion
for
meritorious
conduct
at
cerro
gordo
he
was
made
brevet
major
for
the
same
at
contreras
and
cherubusco
brevet
and
after
chapultepec
he
received
the
additional
brevet
of
colonel
distinctions
fairly
earned
by
energy
and
courage
when
the
war
ended
lee
returned
to
his
former
duties
in
the
engineer
corps
of
the
and
was
placed
in
charge
of
the
works
then
in
process
of
construction
at
fort
carroll
near
baltimore
his
assignment
to
the
duty
of
thus
superintending
the
military
defences
of
hampton
roads
new
york
bay
and
the
approaches
to
baltimore
in
succession
would
seem
to
indicate
that
his
abilities
as
engineer
were
highly
esteemed
of
his
possession
of
such
ability
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
young
officer
was
not
only
thoroughly
trained
in
this
high
department
of
military
science
but
had
for
his
duties
unmistakable
natural
endowments
this
fact
was
clearly
indicated
on
many
occasions
in
the
confederate
struggle
his
eye
for
positions
never
failed
him
it
is
certain
that
had
lee
never
commanded
troops
in
the
field
he
would
have
left
behind
him
the
reputation
of
an
excellent
engineer
in
he
was
called
for
the
first
time
to
command
men
for
his
duties
hitherto
had
been
those
of
military
engineer
astronomer
or
the
act
of
congress
directing
that
two
new
cavalry
regiments
should
be
raised
excited
an
ardent
desire
in
the
officers
of
the
army
to
receive
appointments
in
them
and
lee
was
transferred
from
his
place
of
engineer
to
the
post
of
in
the
second
cavalry
one
of
the
regiments
in
question
the
extraordinary
number
of
names
of
officers
in
this
regiment
who
afterward
became
famous
is
worthy
of
notice
the
colonel
was
albert
sydney
johnston
the
lee
the
senior
major
william
hardee
the
junior
major
george
thomas
the
senior
captain
earl
yan
dorn
the
next
ranking
captain
kirby
smith
the
lieutenants
hood
fields
cosby
major
fitzhugh
lee
johnson
palmer
and
stoneman
all
of
whom
became
general
officers
afterward
on
the
southern
side
with
the
exception
of
thomas
and
the
three
last
named
who
became
prominent
generals
in
the
federal
army
it
is
rare
that
such
a
constellation
of
famous
names
is
found
in
the
list
of
officers
of
a
single
regiment
the
explanation
is
nevertheless
simple
positions
in
the
new
regiments
were
eagerly
coveted
by
the
best
soldiers
of
the
army
and
in
appointing
the
officers
those
of
conspicuous
ability
only
were
selected
the
second
regiment
of
cavalry
thus
became
the
of
the
united
states
army
and
after
albert
sydney
johnston
robert
lee
was
the
ranking
officer
lee
proceeded
with
his
regiment
to
texas
remaining
there
for
several
years
on
frontier
duty
and
does
not
reappear
again
until
such
was
the
early
career
in
the
army
of
the
soldier
soon
to
become
famous
on
a
greater
theatre
that
of
a
and
conscientious
officer
with
the
single
exception
of
his
brief
record
in
the
mexican
war
his
life
had
been
passed
in
official
duties
unconnected
with
active
military
operations
he
was
undoubtedly
what
is
called
a
rising
man
but
he
had
had
no
opportunity
to
display
the
greatest
faculties
of
the
soldier
the
time
was
coming
now
when
he
was
to
be
tested
and
the
measure
of
his
faculties
taken
in
one
of
the
greatest
wars
which
darken
the
pages
of
history
a
single
incident
of
public
importance
marks
the
life
of
lee
between
and
this
was
what
is
known
to
the
world
as
the
john
brown
raid
an
incident
of
the
year
and
preluding
the
approaching
storm
this
occurrence
is
too
well
known
to
require
a
minute
account
in
these
pages
and
we
shall
accordingly
pass
over
it
briefly
indicating
simply
the
part
borne
in
the
affair
by
lee
he
was
in
washington
at
the
time
the
fall
of
on
a
visit
to
his
family
then
residing
at
arlington
near
the
city
when
intelligence
came
that
a
party
of
desperadoes
had
attacked
and
captured
harper
ferry
with
the
avowed
intent
of
arming
and
inciting
to
insurrection
the
slaves
of
the
neighborhood
and
entire
state
lee
was
immediately
thereupon
directed
by
president
buchanan
to
proceed
to
the
point
of
danger
and
arrest
the
rioters
he
did
so
promptly
found
upon
his
arrival
that
brown
and
his
confederates
had
shut
themselves
up
in
an
of
the
town
with
a
number
of
their
prisoners
brown
was
summoned
to
surrender
to
be
delivered
over
to
the
authorities
for
civil
trial
he
refused
and
lee
then
proceeded
to
assault
with
a
force
of
marines
the
stronghold
to
which
brown
had
retreated
the
doors
were
driven
in
brown
firing
upon
the
assailants
and
killing
or
wounding
two
but
he
and
his
men
were
cut
down
and
captured
they
were
turned
over
to
the
virginia
authorities
and
lee
having
performed
the
duty
assigned
him
returned
to
washington
and
soon
afterward
to
texas
he
remained
there
commanding
the
department
until
the
early
spring
of
he
was
then
recalled
to
washington
at
the
moment
when
the
conflict
between
the
north
and
the
south
was
about
to
commence
vi
lee
and
scott
lee
found
the
country
burning
as
with
fever
and
the
air
hot
with
contending
passions
the
animosity
long
smouldering
between
the
two
sections
was
about
to
burst
into
the
flame
of
civil
war
all
men
were
taking
sides
the
war
of
discussion
on
the
floor
of
congress
was
about
to
yield
to
the
clash
of
bayonets
and
the
roar
of
cannon
on
the
any
enumeration
of
the
causes
which
led
to
this
unhappy
state
of
affairs
would
be
worse
than
useless
in
a
volume
like
the
present
even
less
desirable
would
be
a
discussion
of
the
respective
blame
to
be
attached
to
each
of
the
great
opponents
in
inaugurating
the
bitter
and
struggle
such
a
discussion
would
lead
to
nothing
and
would
probably
leave
every
reader
of
the
same
opinion
as
before
it
would
also
be
the
repetition
of
a
and
wearisome
story
these
events
are
known
of
all
men
for
the
political
history
of
the
united
states
from
when
the
slavery
agitation
began
on
the
question
of
the
missouri
restriction
to
when
it
ended
in
civil
convulsion
has
been
discussed
rediscussed
and
discussed
again
in
every
journal
great
and
small
in
the
whole
country
the
person
who
is
not
familiar
therefore
with
the
main
points
at
issue
must
be
ignorant
beyond
the
power
of
any
writer
to
enlighten
him
we
need
only
say
that
the
election
of
abraham
lincoln
the
nominee
of
the
republican
party
had
determined
the
gulf
states
to
leave
the
union
south
carolina
accordingly
seceded
on
the
of
december
and
by
the
of
february
she
had
been
followed
by
mississippi
florida
alabama
georgia
louisiana
and
texas
the
struggle
thus
approached
military
movements
began
at
many
points
like
those
distant
flashes
of
lightning
and
vague
mutterings
which
herald
the
tempest
early
in
february
jefferson
davis
of
mississippi
was
elected
president
of
the
confederate
states
at
montgomery
on
the
of
april
fort
sumter
surrendered
to
general
beauregard
and
on
the
next
day
april
president
lincoln
issued
his
proclamation
declaring
the
gulf
states
in
rebellion
and
calling
upon
the
states
which
had
not
seceded
for
thousand
men
to
enforce
the
federal
authority
tip
to
this
time
the
older
state
of
virginia
had
persistently
resisted
secession
her
refusal
to
array
herself
against
the
general
government
had
been
based
upon
an
unconquerable
repugnance
it
seemed
for
the
dissolution
of
that
union
which
she
had
so
long
loved
from
real
attachment
to
the
flag
which
she
had
done
so
much
to
make
honorable
and
from
a
natural
indisposition
to
rush
headlong
into
a
conflict
whose
whole
fury
would
burst
upon
and
desolate
her
own
soil
the
proclamation
of
president
lincoln
however
decided
her
course
the
convention
had
obdurately
refused
week
after
week
to
pass
the
ordinance
of
secession
now
the
naked
question
was
whether
virginia
should
fight
with
or
against
her
sisters
of
the
gulf
states
she
was
directed
to
furnish
her
quota
of
the
thousand
troops
called
for
by
president
lincoln
and
must
decide
at
once
on
the
of
april
accordingly
an
ordinance
of
secession
passed
the
virginia
convention
and
that
commonwealth
cast
her
fortunes
for
weal
or
woe
with
the
southern
confederacy
such
is
a
brief
and
rapid
summary
of
the
important
public
events
which
had
preceded
or
immediately
followed
lee
return
to
washington
in
march
a
grave
and
to
him
a
very
solemn
question
demanded
instant
decision
which
side
should
he
espouse
the
side
of
the
united
states
or
that
of
the
south
to
choose
either
caused
him
acute
pain
the
attachment
of
the
soldier
to
his
flag
is
greater
than
the
civilian
can
realize
and
lee
had
before
him
the
brightest
military
prospects
the
brief
record
which
we
have
presented
of
his
military
career
in
mexico
conveys
a
very
inadequate
idea
of
the
position
which
he
had
secured
in
the
army
he
was
regarded
by
the
authorities
at
washington
and
by
the
country
at
large
as
the
ablest
and
most
promising
of
all
the
rising
class
of
army
officers
upon
general
winfield
scott
of
the
federal
army
he
had
made
an
impression
which
is
the
most
striking
proof
of
his
great
merit
general
scott
was
enthusiastic
in
his
expressions
of
admiration
for
the
young
virginian
and
with
the
death
of
that
general
which
his
great
age
rendered
a
probable
event
at
any
moment
lee
was
sure
to
become
a
candidate
for
the
highest
promotion
in
the
service
to
this
his
great
ability
gave
him
a
title
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
and
other
considerations
operated
to
advance
his
fortunes
he
was
conceded
by
all
to
be
a
person
of
the
highest
moral
character
was
the
descendant
of
an
influential
and
distinguished
family
which
had
rendered
important
services
to
the
country
in
the
revolution
his
father
had
been
the
friend
of
washington
and
had
achieved
the
first
glories
of
arms
and
the
ample
estates
derived
from
his
wife
gave
him
that
worldly
prestige
which
has
a
direct
influence
upon
the
fortunes
of
an
individual
colonel
lee
could
thus
look
forward
without
the
imputation
of
presumption
to
positions
of
the
highest
responsibility
and
honor
under
the
government
with
the
death
of
scott
and
other
aged
officers
of
the
army
the
place
of
would
fall
to
the
most
deserving
of
the
younger
generation
and
of
this
generation
there
was
no
one
so
able
and
prominent
as
lee
footnote
general
scott
stated
his
purpose
to
recommend
lee
as
his
successor
in
the
chief
command
of
the
reverdy
the
personal
relations
of
lee
with
general
scott
constituted
another
powerful
temptation
to
decide
him
against
going
over
to
the
southern
side
we
have
referred
to
the
great
admiration
which
the
old
soldier
felt
for
the
young
officer
he
is
said
to
have
exclaimed
on
one
occasion
it
would
be
better
for
every
officer
in
the
army
including
myself
to
die
than
robert
lee
there
seems
no
doubt
of
the
fact
that
scott
looked
to
lee
as
his
ultimate
successor
in
the
supreme
command
for
which
his
character
and
military
ability
peculiarly
fitted
him
warm
personal
regard
gave
additional
strength
to
his
feelings
in
lee
favor
and
the
consciousness
of
this
regard
on
the
part
of
his
superior
made
it
still
more
difficult
for
lee
to
come
to
a
decision
vii
lee
resigns
it
is
known
that
general
scott
used
every
argument
to
persuade
lee
not
to
resign
to
retain
him
in
the
service
he
had
been
appointed
on
his
arrival
at
washington
a
full
colonel
and
in
his
name
had
been
sent
in
with
others
by
scott
as
a
proper
person
to
fill
the
vacancy
caused
by
the
death
of
jessup
to
these
tempting
intimations
that
rapid
promotion
would
attend
his
adherence
to
the
united
states
flag
scott
added
personal
appeals
which
coming
from
him
must
have
been
almost
irresistible
for
god
sake
do
resign
lee
the
is
said
to
have
exclaimed
and
in
the
protracted
interviews
which
took
place
between
the
two
officers
every
possible
argument
was
urged
by
the
elder
to
decide
lee
to
remain
firm
the
attempt
was
in
vain
lee
attachment
to
the
flag
he
had
so
long
fought
under
and
his
personal
affection
for
general
scott
were
great
but
his
attachment
to
his
native
state
was
still
more
powerful
by
birth
a
virginian
he
declared
that
he
owed
his
first
duty
to
her
and
his
own
people
if
she
summoned
him
he
must
obey
the
summons
as
long
as
she
remained
in
the
union
he
might
remain
in
the
united
states
army
when
she
seceded
from
the
union
and
took
part
with
the
gulf
states
he
must
follow
her
fortunes
and
do
his
part
in
defending
her
the
struggle
had
been
bitter
but
brief
my
husband
has
wept
tears
of
blood
lee
wrote
to
a
friend
over
this
terrible
war
but
he
must
as
a
man
and
a
virginian
share
the
destiny
of
his
state
which
has
solemnly
pronounced
for
independence
the
secession
of
virginia
by
a
vote
of
the
convention
assembled
at
richmond
decided
lee
in
his
course
he
no
longer
hesitated
to
general
scott
urgent
appeals
not
to
send
in
his
resignation
he
replied
i
am
compelled
to
i
can
not
consult
my
own
feelings
in
this
matter
he
accordingly
wrote
to
general
scott
from
arlington
on
the
of
april
enclosing
his
resignation
the
letter
was
in
the
following
words
general
since
my
interview
with
you
on
the
instant
i
have
felt
that
i
ought
not
longer
to
retain
my
commission
in
the
army
i
therefore
tender
my
resignation
which
i
request
you
will
recommend
for
acceptance
it
would
have
been
presented
at
once
but
for
the
struggle
it
has
cost
me
to
separate
myself
from
a
service
to
which
i
have
devoted
all
the
best
years
of
my
life
and
all
the
ability
i
possessed
during
the
whole
of
that
time
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
have
experienced
nothing
but
kindness
from
my
superiors
and
the
most
cordial
friendship
from
my
comrades
to
no
one
general
have
i
been
as
much
indebted
as
to
yourself
for
uniform
kindness
and
consideration
and
it
has
always
been
my
ardent
desire
to
merit
your
approbation
i
shall
carry
to
the
grave
the
most
grateful
recollections
of
your
kind
consideration
and
your
name
and
fame
will
always
be
dear
to
me
save
in
defence
of
my
native
state
i
never
desire
again
to
draw
my
sword
be
pleased
to
accept
my
most
earnest
wishes
for
the
continuance
of
your
happiness
and
prosperity
and
believe
me
most
truly
yours

this

full
of
dignity
and

courtesy

vainly
attempts
to
hide
the
acute
pain
he
felt
at
parting
from
his
friend
and
abandoning
the
old
service
another
letter
written
on
the
same
day
expresses
the
same
sentiment
of
painful
regret
arlington
virginia
my
dear
sister
i
am
grieved
at
my
inability
to
see
you
i
have
been
waiting
for
a
more
convenient
season
which
has
brought
to
many
before
me
deep
and
lasting
regret
now
we
are
in
a
state
of
war
which
will
yield
to
nothing
the
whole
south
is
in
a
state
of
revolution
into
which
virginia
after
a
long
struggle
has
been
drawn
and
i
recognize
no
necessity
for
this
state
of
and
would
have
forborne
and
pleaded
to
the
end
for
redress
of
grievances
real
or
supposed
yet
in
my
own
person
i
had
to
meet
the
question
i
should
take
part
against
my
native
with
all
my
devotion
to
the
union
and
the
feeling
of
loyalty
and
duty
of
an
american
citizen
i
have
not
been
able
to
make
up
my
mind
to
raise
my
hand
against
my
relatives
my
children
my
home
i
have
therefore
resigned
my
commission
in
the
army
and
save
in
defence
of
my
native
state
with
the
sincere
hope
that
my
poor
services
may
never
be
needed
i
hope
i
may
never
be
called
on
to
draw
my
sword
i
know
you
will
blame
me
but
you
must
think
as
kindly
of
me
as
you
can
and
believe
that
i
have
endeavored
to
do
what
i
thought
right
to
show
you
the
feeling
and
struggle
it
has
cost
me
i
send
a
copy
of
my
letter
to
general
scott
which
accompanied
my
letter
of
resignation
i
have
no
time
for
more
may
god
guard
and
protect
you
and
yours
and
shower
upon
you
every
blessing
is
the
prayer
of
your
devoted
brother
lee
the
expression
used
in
this
letter
though
i
recognize
no
necessity
for
this
state
of
things
conveys
very
clearly
the
political
sentiments
of
the
writer
he
did
not
regard
the
election
of
a
republican
president
even
by
a
strictly
sectional
vote
as
sufficient
ground
for
a
dissolution
of
the
union
it
may
be
added
here
that
such
we
believe
was
the
opinion
of
a
large
number
of
southern
officers
at
that
time
accustomed
to
look
to
the
flag
as
that
which
they
were
called
upon
to
defend
against
all
comers
they
were
loath
to
admit
the
force
of
the
reasoning
which
justified
secession
and
called
upon
them
to
abandon
it
their
final
action
seems
to
have
been
taken
from
the
same
considerations
which
controlled
the
course
of
lee
their
states
called
them
and
they
obeyed
in
resigning
his
commission
and
going
over
to
the
south
lee
sacrificed
his
private
fortunes
in
addition
to
all
his
hopes
of
future
promotion
in
the
united
states
army
his
beautiful
home
arlington
situated
upon
the
heights
opposite
washington
must
be
abandoned
forever
and
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
this
old
mansion
was
a
model
of
peaceful
loveliness
and
attraction
all
around
here
says
a
writer
describing
the
place
arlington
heights
presents
a
lovely
picture
of
rural
beauty
the
lee
house
as
some
term
it
stands
on
a
grassy
lot
surrounded
with
a
grove
of
stately
trees
and
underwood
except
in
front
where
is
a
verdant
sloping
ground
for
a
few
rods
when
it
descends
into
a
valley
spreading
away
in
beautiful
and
broad
expanse
to
the
lovely
potomac
this
part
of
the
splendid
estate
is
apparently
a
meadow
the
grass
waving
in
the
gentle
breeze
like
the
undulating
bosom
of
old
atlantic
to
the
south
north
and
west
the
grounds
are
beautifully
diversified
into
hill
and
valley
and
richly
stored
with
oak
willow
and
maple
though
the
oak
is
the
principal
wood
the
view
from
the
height
is
a
charming
picture
washington
georgetown
and
the
intermediate
potomac
are
all
before
you
in
the
foreground
in
this
old
mansion
crowning
the
grassy
hill
the
young
officer
had
passed
the
happiest
moments
of
his
life
all
around
him
were
spots
associated
with
his
hours
of
purest
enjoyment
each
object
in
the
house
the
old
furniture
and
very
recalled
the
memory
of
washington
and
were
dear
to
him
here
were
many
pieces
of
the
martha
washington
china
portions
of
the
porcelain
set
presented
to
washington
by
lafayette
and
others
in
the
centre
of
each
piece
the
monogram
with
golden
rays
diverging
to
the
names
of
the
old
thirteen
states
here
were
also
fifty
pieces
remnants
of
the
set
of
one
thousand
procured
from
china
by
the
cincinnati
society
and
presented
to
washington
articles
of
elaborate
decoration
in
blue
and
gold
with
the
of
the
society
held
by
fame
with
a
blue
ribbon
from
which
is
suspended
the
eagle
of
the
order
with
a
green
wreath
about
its
neck
and
on
its
breast
a
shield
representing
the
inauguration
of
the
order
add
to
these
the
used
by
washington
and
one
of
his
bookcases
old
portraits
antique
furniture
and
other
memorials
of
the
lee
family
from
stratford
let
the
reader
imagine
the
old
mansion
stored
with
these
priceless
relics
and
he
will
understand
with
what
anguish
lee
must
have
contemplated
what
came
duly
to
pass
the
destruction
by
rude
hands
of
objects
so
dear
to
him
that
he
must
have
foreseen
the
fate
of
his
home
is
certain
to
take
sides
with
virginia
was
to
give
up
arlington
to
its
fate
there
is
no
proof
however
that
this
sacrifice
of
his
personal
fortunes
had
any
effect
upon
him
if
he
could
decide
to
change
his
flag
and
dissolve
every
tie
which
bound
him
to
the
old
service
he
could
sacrifice
all
else
without
much
regret
no
one
will
be
found
to
say
that
the
hope
of
rank
or
emolument
in
the
south
influenced
him
the
character
and
whole
career
of
the
man
contradict
the
idea
his
ground
of
action
may
be
summed
up
in
a
single
sentence
he
went
with
his
state
because
he
believed
it
was
his
duty
to
do
so
and
because
to
ascertain
what
was
his
duty
and
perform
it
was
the
cardinal
maxim
of
his
life
viii
his
reception
at
richmond
no
sooner
had
intelligence
of
lee
resignation
of
his
commission
in
the
united
states
army
reached
richmond
than
governor
letcher
appointed
him
of
the
military
forces
of
virginia
the
appointment
was
confirmed
by
the
convention
rather
by
acclamation
than
formal
vote
and
on
the
of
april
lee
who
had
meanwhile
left
washington
and
repaired
to
richmond
was
honored
by
a
formal
presentation
to
the
convention
the
address
of
president
janney
was
eloquent
and
deserves
to
be
preserved
lee
stood
in
the
middle
aisle
and
the
president
rising
said
lee
in
the
name
of
the
people
of
our
native
state
here
represented
i
bid
you
a
cordial
and
welcome
to
this
hall
in
which
we
may
almost
yet
hear
the
echoes
of
the
voices
of
the
statesmen
the
soldiers
and
sages
of
days
who
have
borne
your
name
and
whose
blood
now
flows
in
your
veins
we
met
in
the
month
of
february
last
charged
with
the
solemn
duty
of
protecting
the
rights
the
honor
and
the
interests
of
the
people
of
this
commonwealth
we
differed
for
a
time
as
to
the
best
means
of
accomplishing
that
object
but
there
never
was
at
any
moment
a
shade
of
difference
among
us
as
to
the
great
object
itself
and
now
virginia
having
taken
her
position
as
far
as
the
power
of
this
convention
extends
we
stand
animated
by
one
impulse
governed
by
one
desire
and
one
determination
and
that
is
that
she
shall
be
defended
and
that
no
spot
of
her
soil
shall
be
polluted
by
the
foot
of
an
invader
when
the
necessity
became
apparent
of
having
a
leader
for
our
forces
all
hearts
and
all
eyes
by
the
impulse
of
an
instinct
which
is
a
surer
guide
than
reason
itself
turned
to
the
old
county
of
westmoreland
we
knew
how
prolific
she
had
been
in
other
days
of
heroes
and
statesmen
we
knew
she
had
given
birth
to
the
father
of
his
country
to
richard
henry
lee
to
monroe
and
last
though
not
least
to
your
own
gallant
father
and
we
knew
well
by
your
deeds
that
her
productive
power
was
not
yet
exhausted
sir
we
watched
with
the
most
profound
and
intense
interest
the
triumphal
march
of
the
army
led
by
general
scott
to
which
you
were
attached
from
vera
cruz
to
the
capital
of
mexico
we
read
of
the
sanguinary
conflicts
and
the
fields
in
all
of
which
victory
perched
upon
our
own
banners
we
knew
of
the
unfading
lustre
that
was
shed
upon
the
american
arms
by
that
campaign
and
we
know
also
what
your
modesty
has
always
disclaimed
that
no
small
share
of
the
glory
of
those
achievements
was
due
to
your
valor
and
your
military
genius
sir
one
of
the
proudest
recollections
of
my
life
will
be
the
honor
that
i
yesterday
had
of
submitting
to
this
body
confirmation
of
the
nomination
made
by
the
governor
of
this
state
of
you
as
of
the
military
and
naval
forces
of
this
commonwealth
i
rose
to
put
the
question
and
when
i
asked
if
this
body
would
advise
and
consent
to
that
appointment
there
rushed
from
the
hearts
to
the
tongues
of
all
the
members
an
affirmative
response
which
told
with
an
emphasis
that
could
leave
no
doubt
of
the
feeling
whence
it
emanated
i
put
the
negative
of
the
question
for
form
sake
but
there
was
an
unbroken
silence
sir
we
have
by
this
unanimous
vote
expressed
our
convictions
that
you
are
at
this
day
among
the
living
citizens
of
virginia
in
war
we
pray
to
god
most
fervently
that
you
may
so
conduct
the
operations
committed
to
your
charge
that
it
may
soon
be
said
of
you
that
you
are
in
peace
and
when
that
time
comes
you
will
have
earned
the
still
prouder
distinction
of
being
in
the
hearts
of
your
countrymen
the
president
concluded
by
saying
that
virginia
on
that
day
intrusted
her
spotless
sword
to
lee
keeping
and
lee
responded
as
follows
president
and
gentlemen
of
the
convention
profoundly
impressed
with
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
for
which
i
must
say
i
was
not
prepared
i
accept
the
position
assigned
me
by
your
partiality
i
would
have
much
preferred
had
your
choice
fallen
upon
an
abler
man
trusting
in
almighty
god
an
approving
conscience
and
the
aid
of
my
i
devote
myself
to
the
service
of
my
native
state
in
whose
behalf
alone
will
i
ever
again
draw
my
sword
such
were
the
modest
and
dignified
expressions
of
lee
in
accepting
the
great
trust
the
reply
is
brief
and
simple
but
these
are
very
great
merits
on
such
an
occasion
no
portion
of
the
address
contains
a
phrase
or
word
denunciatory
of
the
federal
government
or
of
the
motives
of
the
opponents
of
virginia
and
this
moderation
and
absence
of
all
rancor
characterized
the
utterances
of
lee
both
oral
and
written
throughout
the
war
he
spoke
doubtless
as
he
felt
and
uttered
no
expression
of
heated
animosity
because
he
cherished
no
such
sentiment
his
heart
was
bleeding
still
from
the
cruel
trial
it
had
undergone
in
abruptly
tearing
away
from
the
old
service
to
embark
upon
civil
war
with
the
emotions
of
the
present
occasion
excited
by
the
great
ovation
in
his
honor
no
bitterness
mingled
or
at
least
if
there
were
such
bitterness
in
his
heart
he
did
not
permit
it
to
rise
to
his
lips
he
accepted
the
trust
confided
to
him
in
terms
of
dignity
and
moderation
worthy
of
washington
exchanged
grave
salutations
with
the
members
of
the
convention
and
then
retiring
from
the
hall
where
he
had
solemnly
consecrated
his
life
to
his
native
commonwealth
proceeded
at
once
to
energetic
work
to
get
the
state
in
a
posture
of
defence
the
sentiment
of
the
country
in
reference
to
lee
was
even
warmer
than
that
of
the
convention
for
weeks
reports
had
been
rife
that
he
had
determined
to
adhere
to
the
federal
government
in
the
approaching
struggle
such
an
event
it
was
felt
by
all
would
be
a
public
calamity
to
virginia
and
the
general
joy
may
be
imagined
when
it
was
known
that
lee
had
resigned
and
come
to
fight
with
his
own
people
he
assumed
command
therefore
of
all
the
virginia
forces
in
the
midst
of
universal
public
rejoicing
and
the
fact
gave
strength
and
consistency
to
the
general
determination
to
resist
the
federal
government
to
the
last
ix
lee
in
at
this
time
april
general
lee
was
years
of
age
and
may
be
said
to
have
been
in
the
ripe
vigor
of
every
faculty
physically
and
intellectually
he
was
at
his
best
and
in
the
bloom
of
manhood
his
figure
was
erect
and
he
bore
himself
with
the
brief
somewhat
stiff
air
of
command
derived
from
his
military
education
and
service
in
the
army
this
air
of
the
professional
soldier
which
characterized
generally
the
graduates
of
west
point
was
replaced
afterward
by
a
grave
dignity
the
result
of
high
command
and
great
responsibilities
in
april
however
he
was
rather
the
ordinary
army
officer
in
bearing
than
the
he
had
always
been
remarkable
for
his
manly
beauty
both
of
face
and
figure
and
the
cares
of
great
command
had
not
yet
whitened
his
hair
there
was
not
a
gray
hair
in
his
head
and
his
mustache
was
dark
and
heavy
the
rest
of
his
face
was
and
his
cheeks
had
that
fresh
ruddy
hue
which
indicates
high
physical
health
this
was
not
at
that
time
or
afterward
the
result
of
high
living
of
all
the
prominent
personages
of
his
epoch
lee
was
perhaps
the
most
temperate
he
rarely
drank
even
so
much
as
a
single
glass
of
wine
and
it
was
a
matter
of
general
notoriety
in
the
army
afterward
that
he
cared
not
what
he
ate
the
ruddy
appearance
which
characterized
him
from
first
to
last
was
the
result
of
the
most
physical
health
which
no
species
of
indulgence
had
ever
impaired
he
used
no
tobacco
then
or
afterward
in
any
shape
that
seductive
weed
which
has
been
called
the
soldier
comfort
and
seemed
indeed
superior
to
all
those
small
vices
which
assail
men
of
his
profession
grave
silent
with
a
military
composure
of
bearing
which
amounted
at
times
as
we
have
said
to
stiffness
he
resembled
a
machine
in
the
shape
of
a
man
at
least
this
was
the
impression
which
he
produced
upon
those
who
saw
him
in
public
at
this
time
the
writer
design
here
is
to
indicate
the
personal
appearance
and
bearing
of
general
lee
on
the
threshold
of
the
war
it
may
be
said
by
way
of
summing
up
all
that
he
was
a
in
appearance
the
as
distinguished
from
the
civilian
and
no
doubt
impressed
those
who
held
official
interviews
with
him
as
a
personage
of
marked
reserve
the
truth
and
frankness
of
the
man
under
all
circumstances
and
his
great
warm
heart
full
of
honesty
and
unassuming
simplicity
became
known
only
in
the
progress
of
the
war
how
simple
and
true
and
honest
he
was
will
appear
from
a
letter
to
his
son
custis
lee
written
some
time
before
you
must
study
he
wrote
to
be
frank
with
the
world
frankness
is
the
child
of
honesty
and
courage
say
just
what
you
mean
to
do
on
every
occasion
and
take
it
for
granted
you
mean
to
do
right
if
a
friend
asks
a
favor
you
should
grant
it
if
it
is
reasonable
if
not
tell
him
plainly
why
you
can
not
you
will
wrong
him
and
wrong
yourself
by
equivocation
of
any
kind
never
do
a
wrong
thing
to
make
a
friend
or
keep
one
the
man
who
requires
you
to
do
so
is
dearly
purchased
at
a
sacrifice
deal
kindly
but
firmly
with
all
your
classmates
you
will
find
it
the
policy
which
wears
best
above
all
do
not
appear
to
others
what
you
are
not
if
you
have
any
fault
to
find
with
any
one
tell
him
not
others
of
what
you
complain
there
is
no
more
dangerous
experiment
than
that
of
undertaking
to
be
one
thing
before
a
face
and
another
behind
his
back
we
should
live
act
and
say
nothing
to
the
injury
of
any
one
it
is
not
only
best
as
a
matter
of
principle
but
it
is
the
path
to
peace
and
honor
in
regard
to
duty
let
me
in
conclusion
of
this
hasty
letter
inform
you
that
nearly
a
hundred
years
ago
there
was
a
day
of
remarkable
gloom
and
darkness
still
known
as
dark
day
a
day
when
the
light
of
the
sun
was
slowly
extinguished
as
if
by
an
eclipse
the
legislature
of
connecticut
was
in
session
and
as
its
members
saw
the
unexpected
and
unaccountable
darkness
coming
on
they
shared
in
the
general
awe
and
terror
it
was
supposed
by
many
that
the
last
day
the
day
of
judgment
had
come
some
one
in
the
consternation
of
the
hour
moved
an
adjournment
then
there
arose
an
old
puritan
legislator
davenport
of
stamford
and
said
that
if
the
last
day
had
come
he
desired
to
be
found
at
his
place
doing
his
duty
and
therefore
moved
that
candles
be
brought
in
so
that
the
house
could
proceed
with
its
duty
there
was
quietness
in
that
man
mind
the
quietness
of
heavenly
wisdom
and
inflexible
willingness
to
obey
present
duty
duty
then
is
the
sublimest
word
in
our
language
do
your
duty
in
all
things
like
the
old
puritan
you
can
not
do
more
you
should
never
wish
to
do
less
never
let
me
and
your
mother
wear
one
gray
hair
for
any
lack
of
duty
on
your
part
the
maxims
of
this
letter
indicate
the
noble
and
conscientious
character
of
the
man
who
wrote
it
frankness
is
the
child
of
honesty
and
courage
say
just
what
you
mean
to
do
on
every
occasion
never
do
a
wrong
thing
to
make
a
friend
or
keep
one
duty
is
the
sublimest
word
in
our
language
do
your
duty
in
all
things
you
can
not
do
more
that
he
lived
up
to
these
great
maxims
amid
all
the
troubled
scenes
and
hot
passions
of
a
stormy
epoch
is
lee
greatest
glory
his
fame
as
a
soldier
great
as
it
is
yields
to
the
true
glory
of
having
placed
duty
before
his
eyes
always
as
the
supreme
object
of
life
he
resigned
his
commission
from
a
sense
of
duty
to
his
native
state
made
this
same
duty
his
sole
aim
in
every
portion
of
his
subsequent
career
and
when
all
had
failed
and
the
cause
he
had
fought
for
was
overthrown
it
was
the
consciousness
of
having
performed
conscientiously
and
to
his
utmost
his
whole
duty
which
took
the
sting
from
defeat
and
gave
him
that
noble
calmness
which
the
whole
world
saw
and
admired
human
virtue
should
be
equal
to
human
calamity
were
his
august
words
when
all
was
lost
and
men
minds
were
sinking
under
the
accumulated
agony
of
defeat
and
despair
those
words
could
only
have
been
uttered
by
a
man
who
made
duty
the
paramount
object
of
living
the
performance
of
it
the
true
glory
and
crown
of
virtuous
manhood
it
may
be
objected
by
some
critics
that
he
mistook
his
duty
in
espousing
the
southern
cause
doubtless
many
persons
will
urge
that
objection
and
declare
that
the
words
here
written
are
senseless
panegyric
but
that
will
not
affect
the
truth
or
detract
from
lee
great
character
he
performed
at
least
what
in
his
inmost
soul
considered
his
duty
and
from
the
beginning
of
his
career
when
all
was
so
bright
to
its
termination
when
all
was
so
dark
it
will
be
found
that
his
controlling
sentiment
was
first
last
and
all
the
time
this
performance
of
duty
the
old
puritan
whose
example
he
admired
so
much
was
not
more
calm
and
resolute
when
the
last
day
of
the
cause
he
fought
for
came
in
the
spring
of
it
was
plain
to
all
who
saw
the
man
standing
unmoved
in
the
midst
of
the
general
disaster
that
his
sole
desire
was
to
be
found
at
his
place
and
doing
his
duty
from
this
species
of
digression
upon
the
moral
constituents
of
the
individual
we
pass
to
the
record
of
that
career
which
made
the
great
fame
of
the
soldier
the
war
had
already
begun
when
lee
took
command
of
the
provisional
forces
of
virginia
and
the
collisions
in
various
portions
of
the
gulf
states
between
the
federal
and
state
authorities
were
followed
by
overt
acts
in
virginia
which
all
felt
would
be
the
real
of
the
war
the
north
entered
upon
the
struggle
with
very
great
ardor
and
enthusiasm
the
call
for
volunteers
to
enforce
obedience
to
the
federal
authority
was
tumultuously
responded
to
throughout
the
entire
north
and
troops
were
hurried
forward
to
washington
which
soon
became
an
enormous
camp
the
war
began
in
virginia
with
the
evacuation
and
attempted
destruction
of
the
works
at
harper
ferry
by
the
federal
officer
in
command
there
this
was
on
the
of
april
and
on
the
next
day
reinforcements
were
thrown
into
fortress
monroe
and
the
at
norfolk
with
the
shipping
set
on
fire
and
abandoned
lee
thus
found
the
commonwealth
in
a
state
of
war
and
all
his
energies
were
immediately
concentrated
upon
the
work
of
placing
her
in
a
condition
of
defence
he
established
his
headquarters
in
the
at
richmond
orderlies
were
seen
coming
and
going
bustle
reigned
throughout
the
building
and
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
general
lee
labored
incessantly
to
organize
the
means
of
resistance
from
the
first
moment
all
had
felt
that
virginia
from
her
geographical
position
adjoining
the
federal
frontier
and
facing
the
federal
capital
would
become
the
arena
of
the
earliest
longest
and
most
determined
struggle
her
large
territory
and
moral
influence
as
the
oldest
of
the
southern
states
also
made
her
the
chief
object
of
the
federal
hostility
it
was
felt
that
if
virginia
were
occupied
and
her
people
reduced
under
the
federal
authority
again
the
southern
cause
would
be
deprived
of
a
large
amount
of
its
prestige
and
strength
the
authorities
of
the
gulf
states
accordingly
hurried
forward
to
richmond
all
available
troops
and
from
all
parts
of
virginia
the
volunteer
regiments
which
had
sprung
up
like
magic
were
in
like
manner
forwarded
by
railway
to
the
capital
every
train
brought
additions
to
this
great
mass
of
raw
war
material
large
camps
rose
around
richmond
chief
among
which
was
that
named
camp
lee
and
the
work
of
drilling
and
moulding
this
crude
material
for
the
great
work
before
it
was
ardently
proceeded
with
under
the
supervision
of
lee
an
executive
board
or
military
council
had
been
formed
consisting
of
governor
letcher
and
other
prominent
officials
but
these
gentlemen
had
the
good
sense
to
intrust
the
main
work
of
organizing
an
army
to
lee
as
yet
the
great
question
at
richmond
was
to
place
virginia
in
a
state
of
defence
to
prepare
that
commonwealth
for
the
hour
of
trial
by
enrolling
her
own
people
it
will
be
remembered
that
lee
held
no
commission
from
the
confederate
states
he
was
of
the
provisional
army
of
virginia
and
to
place
this
provisional
army
in
a
condition
to
take
the
field
was
the
first
duty
before
him
it
was
difficult
not
from
want
of
ardor
in
the
population
but
from
the
want
of
the
commonest
material
necessary
in
time
of
war
there
were
few
arms
and
but
small
supplies
of
ammunition
while
the
federal
government
entered
upon
the
war
with
the
amplest
resources
the
south
found
herself
almost
entirely
destitute
of
the
munitions
essential
to
her
protection
all
was
to
be
organized
and
put
at
once
into
operation
the
quartermaster
commissary
ordnance
and
other
departments
transportation
supplies
of
rations
arms
ammunition
all
were
to
be
collected
immediately
the
material
existed
or
could
be
supplied
as
the
sequel
clearly
showed
but
as
yet
there
was
almost
nothing
and
it
was
chiefly
to
the
work
of
organizing
these
departments
first
of
all
that
general
lee
and
the
military
council
addressed
themselves
with
the
utmost
energy
the
result
was
that
the
state
found
herself
very
soon
in
a
condition
to
offer
a
determined
resistance
the
troops
at
the
various
camps
of
instruction
were
successively
sent
to
the
field
others
took
their
places
and
the
work
of
drilling
the
raw
material
into
soldiers
went
on
supplies
were
collected
transportation
found
workshops
for
the
construction
of
arms
and
ammunition
sprung
up
cannon
cartridges
fixed
and
other
ammunition
were
produced
in
quantities
and
in
a
time
which
now
seems
wholly
inadequate
for
such
a
result
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
was
ready
to
take
the
field
against
the
federal
government
x
the
war
begins
early
in
may
virginia
became
formally
a
member
of
the
southern
confederacy
and
the
troops
which
she
had
raised
a
portion
of
the
confederate
states
army
when
richmond
became
the
capital
soon
afterward
and
the
southern
congress
assembled
five
were
appointed
generals
cooper
albert
johnston
lee
johnston
and
beauregard
large
forces
had
been
meanwhile
raised
throughout
the
south
virginia
became
the
centre
of
all
eyes
as
the
scene
of
the
main
struggle
and
early
in
june
occurred
at
bethel
in
lower
virginia
the
first
prominent
affair
in
which
general
butler
with
about
four
thousand
men
was
repulsed
and
forced
to
retire
the
affair
at
bethel
which
was
of
small
importance
was
followed
by
movements
in
northern
and
western
virginia
the
battles
at
rich
mountain
and
carrick
ford
johnston
movements
in
the
valley
and
the
advance
of
the
main
federal
army
on
the
force
under
beauregard
which
resulted
in
the
first
battle
of
manassas
in
these
events
general
lee
bore
no
part
and
we
need
not
speak
of
them
further
than
to
present
a
summary
of
the
results
the
federal
design
had
been
to
penetrate
virginia
in
three
columns
one
was
to
advance
from
the
northwest
under
general
mcclellan
a
second
under
general
patterson
was
to
take
possession
of
the
valley
and
a
third
under
general
mcdowell
was
to
drive
beauregard
back
from
manassas
on
richmond
only
one
of
these
columns
that
of
mcclellan
succeeded
in
its
undertaking
johnston
held
patterson
in
check
in
the
valley
until
the
advance
upon
manassas
then
by
a
flank
march
the
confederate
general
hastened
to
the
assistance
of
beauregard
the
battle
of
manassas
followed
on
sunday
the
of
july
after
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
force
the
confederate
right
general
mcdowell
assailed
their
left
making
for
that
purpose
a
long
and
at
first
carried
all
before
him
reënforcements
were
hurried
forward
however
and
the
confederates
fought
with
the
energy
of
men
defending
their
own
soil
the
obstinate
stand
made
by
evans
bee
bartow
jackson
and
their
brave
associates
turned
the
fortunes
of
the
day
and
when
reënforcements
subsequently
reached
the
field
under
general
kirby
smith
and
general
early
the
federal
troops
retreated
in
great
disorder
toward
washington
xi
lee
advance
into
western
virginia
general
lee
nowhere
appears
as
we
have
seen
in
these
first
great
movements
and
conflicts
he
was
without
any
specific
command
and
remained
at
richmond
engaged
in
placing
that
city
in
a
state
of
defence
the
works
which
he
constructed
proved
subsequently
of
great
importance
to
the
city
and
a
northern
officer
writes
of
lee
while
the
fortifications
of
richmond
stand
his
name
will
evoke
admiration
the
art
of
war
is
unacquainted
with
any
defence
so
admirable
lee
first
appearance
in
the
war
as
commander
of
troops
in
the
field
took
place
in
the
fall
of
when
he
was
sent
to
operate
against
the
forces
under
general
rosecrans
in
the
fastnesses
of
western
virginia
this
indecisive
and
unimportant
movement
has
been
the
subject
of
various
comment
the
official
reports
were
burned
in
the
conflagration
at
richmond
or
captured
and
the
elaborate
plans
drawn
up
by
lee
of
his
intended
movement
against
general
reynolds
at
cheat
mountain
have
in
the
same
manner
disappeared
under
these
circumstances
and
as
the
present
writer
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
subject
it
seems
best
to
simply
quote
the
brief
statement
which
follows
it
is
derived
from
an
officer
of
high
rank
and
character
whose
statement
is
only
second
in
value
to
that
of
general
lee
himself
after
general
garnett
death
general
lee
was
sent
by
the
president
to
ascertain
what
could
be
done
in
the
region
and
to
endeavor
to
harmonize
our
movements
in
that
part
of
the
state
he
was
not
ordered
to
take
command
of
the
troops
nor
did
he
do
so
during
the
whole
time
he
was
there
soon
after
his
arrival
he
came
to
the
decided
conclusion
that
was
not
the
line
from
which
to
make
an
offensive
movement
the
country
although
not
hostile
was
not
friendly
supplies
could
not
be
obtained
the
enemy
had
possession
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
from
which
and
the
ohio
river
as
a
base
he
could
operate
with
great
advantage
against
us
and
our
only
chance
was
to
drive
him
from
the
railroad
take
possession
and
use
it
ourselves
we
had
not
the
means
of
doing
this
and
consequently
could
only
try
to
hold
as
much
country
as
possible
and
occupy
as
large
a
force
of
the
enemy
as
could
be
kept
in
front
of
us
the
movement
against
cheat
mountain
which
failed
was
undertaken
with
a
view
of
causing
the
enemy
to
contract
his
lines
and
enable
us
to
unite
the
troops
under
generals
jackson
of
georgia
and
loring
after
the
failure
of
this
movement
on
our
part
general
rosecrans
feeling
secure
strengthened
his
lines
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
went
with
a
part
of
his
forces
to
the
kanawha
driving
our
forces
across
the
gauley
general
lee
then
went
to
that
line
of
operations
to
endeavor
to
unite
the
troops
under
generals
floyd
and
wise
and
stop
the
movements
under
rosecrans
general
loring
with
a
part
of
his
force
from
valley
mountain
joined
the
forces
at
sewell
mountain
rosecrans
movement
was
stopped
and
the
season
for
operations
in
that
country
being
over
general
lee
was
ordered
to
richmond
and
soon
afterward
sent
to
south
carolina
to
meet
the
movement
of
the
enemy
from
port
royal
etc
he
remained
in
south
carolina
until
shortly
before
the
commencement
of
the
campaign
before
richmond
in
the
months
spent
by
general
lee
in
superintending
the
coast
defences
of
south
carolina
and
georgia
present
nothing
of
interest
and
we
shall
therefore
pass
to
the
spring
of
when
he
returned
to
richmond
his
services
as
engineer
had
been
highly
appreciated
by
the
people
of
the
south
and
a
writer
of
the
period
said
the
time
will
yet
come
when
his
superior
abilities
will
be
vindicated
both
to
his
own
renown
and
the
glory
of
his
country
the
time
was
now
at
hand
when
these
abilities
if
the
individual
possessed
them
were
to
have
an
opportunity
to
display
themselves
xii
lee
last
interview
with
bishop
meade
a
touching
incident
of
lee
life
belongs
to
this
time
the
early
spring
of
bishop
meade
the
venerable
head
of
the
episcopal
church
in
virginia
lay
at
the
point
of
death
in
the
city
of
richmond
when
general
lee
was
informed
of
the
fact
he
exhibited
lively
emotion
for
the
good
bishop
as
we
have
said
in
the
commencement
of
this
narrative
had
taught
him
his
catechism
when
he
was
a
boy
in
alexandria
on
the
day
before
the
bishop
death
general
lee
called
in
the
morning
to
see
him
but
such
was
the
state
of
prostration
under
which
the
sick
man
labored
that
only
a
few
of
his
most
intimate
friends
were
permitted
to
have
access
to
his
chamber
in
the
evening
general
lee
called
again
and
his
name
was
announced
to
bishop
meade
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
he
said
faintly
for
his
breathing
had
become
much
oppressed
and
he
spoke
with
great
difficulty
i
must
see
him
if
only
for
a
few
moments
general
lee
was
accordingly
introduced
and
approached
the
dying
man
with
evidences
of
great
emotion
in
his
countenance
taking
the
thin
hand
in
his
own
he
said
how
do
you
feel
bishop
almost
gone
replied
bishop
meade
in
a
voice
so
weak
that
it
was
almost
inaudible
but
i
wanted
to
see
you
once
more
he
paused
for
an
instant
breathing
heavily
and
looking
at
lee
with
deep
feeling
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
robert
he
faltered
out
and
fit
you
for
your
high
and
responsible
duties
i
ca
call
you
i
must
call
you
i
have
heard
you
your
catechism
too
often
general
lee
pressed
the
feeble
hand
and
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
yes
bishop
very
often
he
said
in
reply
to
the
last
words
uttered
by
the
bishop
a
brief
conversation
followed
bishop
meade
making
inquiries
in
reference
to
lee
who
was
his
own
relative
and
other
members
of
the
family
he
also
says
the
clergyman
who
furnishes
these
particulars
put
some
pertinent
questions
to
general
lee
about
the
state
of
public
affairs
and
of
the
army
showing
the
most
lively
interest
in
the
success
of
our
cause
it
now
became
necessary
to
terminate
an
interview
which
in
the
feeble
condition
of
the
aged
man
could
not
be
prolonged
much
exhausted
and
laboring
under
deep
emotion
bishop
meade
shook
the
general
by
the
hand
and
said
heaven
bless
you
heaven
bless
you
and
give
you
wisdom
for
your
important
and
arduous
duties
these
were
the
last
words
uttered
during
the
interview
general
lee
pressed
the
dying
man
hand
released
it
stood
for
several
minutes
by
the
bedside
motionless
and
in
perfect
silence
and
then
went
out
of
the
room
on
the
next
morning
bishop
meade
expired

part

front
of
i
plan
of
the
federal
campaign
the
pathetic
interview
which
we
have
just
described
took
place
in
the
month
of
march
by
the
latter
part
of
that
month
general
mcclellan
in
command
of
an
army
of
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
men
landed
on
the
peninsula
between
the
james
and
york
rivers
and
after
engagements
with
the
forces
of
general
johnston
advanced
up
the
peninsula
the
confederates
slowly
retiring
in
the
latter
part
of
may
a
portion
of
the
federal
forces
had
crossed
the
chickahominy
and
confronted
general
johnston
defending
richmond
such
was
the
serious
condition
of
affairs
in
the
spring
of
the
federal
sword
had
nearly
pierced
the
heart
of
virginia
and
as
the
course
of
events
was
about
to
place
lee
in
charge
of
her
destinies
a
brief
notice
is
indispensable
of
the
designs
of
the
adversaries
against
whom
he
was
to
contend
on
the
great
arena
of
the
state
while
the
south
had
been
lulled
to
sleep
as
it
were
by
the
battle
of
manassas
the
north
greatly
enraged
at
the
disaster
had
prepared
to
prosecute
the
war
still
more
vigorously
the
military
resources
of
the
south
had
been
plainly
underestimated
it
was
now
obvious
that
the
north
had
to
fight
with
a
dangerous
adversary
and
that
the
people
of
the
south
were
entirely
in
earnest
many
journals
of
the
north
had
ridiculed
the
idea
of
war
and
one
of
them
had
spoken
of
the
great
uprising
of
the
southern
states
from
the
potomac
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
as
a
mere
local
commotion
which
a
force
of
fifty
thousand
men
would
be
able
to
put
down
without
difficulty
a
column
of
thousand
men
it
was
said
would
be
sufficient
to
carry
all
before
it
in
virginia
and
capture
richmond
and
the
comment
on
this
statement
had
been
the
battle
of
manassas
where
a
force
of
more
than
fifty
thousand
had
been
defeated
and
driven
back
to
washington
it
was
thus
apparent
that
the
war
was
to
be
a
serious
struggle
in
which
the
north
would
be
compelled
to
exert
all
her
energies
the
people
responded
to
the
call
upon
them
with
enthusiasm
all
the
roving
and
adventurous
elements
of
northern
society
flocked
to
the
federal
standard
and
in
a
short
time
a
large
force
had
once
more
assembled
at
washington
the
work
now
was
to
drill
equip
and
put
it
in
efficient
condition
for
taking
the
field
this
was
undertaken
with
great
energy
the
congress
coöperating
with
the
executive
in
every
manner
the
city
of
washington
resounded
with
the
wheels
of
artillery
and
the
tramp
of
cavalry
the
workshops
were
busy
night
and
day
to
supply
arms
and
ammunition
and
the
best
officers
devoted
themselves
without
rest
to
the
work
of
drilling
and
disciplining
the
mass
by
the
spring
of
a
force
of
about
two
hundred
thousand
men
was
ready
to
take
the
field
in
virginia
general
scott
was
not
to
command
in
the
coming
campaigns
he
had
retired
in
the
latter
part
of
the
year
and
his
place
had
been
filled
by
a
young
officer
of
rising
reputation
general
george
mcclellan
who
had
achieved
the
successes
of
rich
mountain
and
carrick
ford
in
western
virginia
general
mcclellan
was
not
yet
forty
but
had
impressed
the
authorities
with
a
high
opinion
of
his
abilities
a
soldier
by
profession
and
enjoying
the
distinction
of
having
served
with
great
credit
in
the
mexican
war
he
had
been
sent
as
united
states
military
commissioner
to
the
crimea
and
on
his
return
had
written
a
book
of
marked
ability
on
the
military
organizations
of
the
powers
of
europe
when
the
struggle
between
the
north
and
south
approached
he
was
said
with
what
truth
we
know
not
to
have
hesitated
before
determining
upon
his
course
but
it
is
probable
that
the
only
question
with
him
was
whether
he
should
fight
for
the
north
or
remain
neutral
in
his
politics
he
was
a
democrat
and
the
war
on
the
south
is
said
to
have
shocked
his
view
but
whatever
his
sentiments
had
been
he
accepted
command
and
fought
a
successful
campaign
in
western
virginia
from
that
moment
his
name
became
famous
he
was
said
to
have
achieved
two
victories
in
one
day
and
he
received
from
the
newspapers
the
flattering
name
of
the
young
napoleon
the
result
of
this
successful
campaign
slight
in
importance
as
it
was
procured
for
general
mcclellan
the
high
post
of
of
the
armies
of
the
united
states
operations
in
every
portion
of
the
south
were
to
be
directed
by
him
and
he
was
especially
intrusted
with
the
important
work
of
organizing
the
new
levies
at
washington
this
he
performed
with
very
great
ability
under
his
vigorous
hand
the
raw
material
soon
took
shape
he
gave
his
personal
attention
to
every
department
and
the
result
as
we
have
said
in
the
early
spring
of
was
an
army
of
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
men
for
operations
in
virginia
alone
the
great
point
now
to
be
determined
was
the
best
line
of
operations
against
richmond
president
lincoln
was
strongly
in
favor
of
an
advance
by
way
of
manassas
and
the
orange
and
alexandria
railroad
which
he
thought
would
insure
the
safety
of
the
federal
capital
this
was
always
throughout
the
whole
war
a
controlling
consideration
with
him
and
regarded
in
the
light
of
subsequent
events
this
solicitude
seems
to
have
been
well
founded
more
than
once
afterward
general
lee
to
use
his
own
expression
thought
of
swapping
queens
that
is
to
say
advancing
upon
washington
without
regard
to
the
capture
of
richmond
and
president
lincoln
with
that
excellent
good
sense
which
he
generally
exhibited
felt
that
the
loss
of
washington
would
prove
almost
fatal
to
the
federal
such
was
the
origin
of
the
president
preference
for
the
manassas
line
general
mcclellan
did
not
share
it
he
assented
it
seems
at
first
but
soon
resolved
to
adopt
another
plan
an
advance
either
from
urbanna
on
the
rappahannock
or
from
west
point
on
the
york
against
his
views
and
determination
the
president
and
authorities
struggled
in
vain
mcclellan
treated
their
arguments
and
appeals
with
a
want
of
ceremony
amounting
at
times
nearly
to
contempt
he
adhered
to
his
own
plan
resolutely
and
in
the
end
the
president
gave
way
in
rueful
protest
against
the
continued
inactivity
of
general
mcclellan
president
lincoln
had
exclaimed
if
general
mcclellan
does
not
want
to
use
the
army
i
would
like
to
borrow
it
and
if
something
is
not
soon
done
the
bottom
will
be
out
of
the
whole
affair
at
last
general
mcclellan
carried
his
point
and
an
advance
against
richmond
from
the
peninsula
was
decided
upon
in
order
to
assist
this
movement
general
fremont
was
to
march
through
northwestern
virginia
and
general
banks
up
the
valley
and
having
thus
arranged
their
programme
the
federal
authorities
began
to
move
forward
to
the
great
work
to
transport
an
army
of
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
men
by
water
to
the
peninsula
was
a
heavy
undertaking
but
the
ample
resources
of
the
government
enabled
them
to
do
so
without
difficulty
general
mcclellan
who
had
now
been
removed
from
his
post
of
of
the
armies
of
the
united
states
and
assigned
to
the
command
only
of
the
army
to
operate
against
richmond
landed
his
forces
on
the
peninsula
and
after
several
actions
of
an
obstinate
description
advanced
toward
the
chickahominy
general
johnston
the
confederate
commander
deliberately
retiring
johnston
took
up
a
position
behind
this
stream
and
toward
the
end
of
may
mcclellan
crossed
a
portion
of
his
forces
and
confronted
him
ii
johnston
is
wounded
the
army
thus
threatening
the
city
which
had
become
the
capital
of
the
confederacy
was
large
and
excellently
equipped
it
numbered
in
all
according
to
general
mcclellan
report
one
hundred
and
thousand
eight
hundred
and
men
of
whom
one
hundred
and
fifteen
thousand
one
hundred
and
two
were
effective
troops
that
is
to
say
present
and
ready
for
duty
as
in
the
field
results
of
such
magnitude
were
expected
from
this
great
army
that
all
the
resources
of
the
federal
government
had
been
taxed
to
bring
it
to
the
highest
possible
state
of
efficiency
the
artillery
was
numerous
and
of
the
most
approved
description
of
the
best
patterns
and
workmanship
were
profusely
supplied
the
ammunition
was
of
the
finest
quality
and
almost
inexhaustible
in
quantity
and
the
rations
for
the
subsistence
of
the
troops
which
were
equally
excellent
and
abundant
were
brought
up
in
an
unfailing
stream
from
the
white
house
in
general
mcclellan
rear
over
the
york
river
railroad
which
ran
straight
to
his
army
such
was
the
admirable
condition
of
the
large
force
under
command
of
general
mcclellan
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
an
army
better
prepared
for
active
operations
and
the
position
which
it
held
had
been
well
selected
the
left
of
the
army
was
protected
by
the
wellnigh
impassable
morass
of
the
swamp
and
all
the
approaches
from
the
direction
of
richmond
were
obstructed
by
the
natural
difficulties
of
the
ground
which
had
been
rendered
still
more
forbidding
by
an
abattis
of
felled
trees
and
earthworks
of
the
best
description
unless
the
right
of
mcclellan
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
chickahominy
were
turned
by
the
confederates
his
communications
with
his
base
at
the
white
house
and
the
safety
of
his
army
were
assured
and
even
the
apparently
improbable
contingency
of
such
an
assault
on
his
right
had
been
provided
for
other
bodies
of
federal
troops
had
advanced
into
virginia
to
coöperate
with
the
main
force
on
the
peninsula
general
mcdowell
the
able
soldier
who
had
nearly
defeated
the
confederates
at
manassas
was
at
fredericksburg
with
a
force
of
about
forty
thousand
men
which
were
to
advance
southward
without
loss
of
time
and
unite
with
general
mcclellan
right
this
would
completely
insure
the
communications
of
his
army
from
interruption
and
it
was
no
doubt
expected
that
generals
fremont
and
banks
would
coöperate
in
the
movement
also
fremont
was
to
advance
from
northwestern
virginia
driving
before
him
the
small
confederate
force
under
jackson
in
the
valley
and
general
banks
then
at
winchester
was
to
cross
the
blue
ridge
mountains
and
posting
his
forces
along
the
manassas
railroad
guard
the
approaches
to
washington
when
mcdowell
advanced
from
fredericksburg
to
the
aid
of
general
mcclellan
thus
richmond
would
be
half
encircled
by
federal
armies
general
mcclellan
if
permitted
by
the
confederates
to
carry
out
his
plan
of
operations
would
soon
be
in
command
of
about
two
hundred
thousand
men
and
with
this
force
it
was
anticipated
he
would
certainly
be
able
to
capture
richmond
such
was
the
federal
programme
of
the
war
in
virginia
it
promised
great
results
and
ought
it
would
seem
to
have
succeeded
the
confederate
forces
in
virginia
did
not
number
in
all
one
hundred
thousand
men
and
it
is
now
apparent
that
without
the
able
strategy
of
johnston
lee
and
jackson
general
mcclellan
would
have
been
in
possession
of
richmond
before
the
summer
prompt
action
was
thus
necessary
on
the
part
of
the
sagacious
soldier
commanding
the
army
at
richmond
and
directing
operations
throughout
the
theatre
of
action
in
virginia
the
officer
in
question
was
general
joseph
johnston
a
virginian
by
birth
who
had
first
held
general
patterson
in
check
in
the
shenandoah
valley
and
then
hastened
to
the
assistance
of
general
beauregard
at
manassas
where
in
right
of
his
superior
rank
he
took
command
before
the
enemy
design
to
advance
up
the
peninsula
had
been
developed
johnston
had
made
a
masterly
retreat
from
manassas
reappearing
with
his
force
of
about
forty
thousand
men
on
the
peninsula
he
had
obstinately
opposed
mcclellan
and
only
retired
when
he
was
compelled
by
numbers
to
do
so
with
the
resolution
however
of
fighting
a
decisive
battle
on
the
chickahominy
in
face
figure
and
character
general
johnston
was
thoroughly
the
soldier
above
the
medium
height
with
an
erect
figure
in
a
uniform
buttoned
to
the
chin
with
a
ruddy
face
decorated
with
gray
mustache
and
tuft
on
the
chin
reserved
in
manner
brief
of
speech
without
impulses
of
any
description
it
seemed
general
johnston
appearance
and
bearing
were
military
to
stiffness
and
he
was
popularly
compared
to
a
gamecock
ready
for
battle
at
any
moment
as
a
soldier
his
reputation
was
deservedly
high
to
unshrinking
personal
courage
he
added
a
capacity
for
the
conduct
of
great
operations
throughout
his
career
he
enjoyed
a
profound
public
appreciation
of
his
abilities
as
a
commander
and
was
universally
respected
as
a
gentleman
and
a
patriot
general
johnston
surveying
the
whole
field
in
virginia
and
penetrating
it
would
seem
the
designs
of
the
enemy
had
hastened
to
direct
general
jackson
commanding
in
the
valley
to
begin
offensive
operations
and
by
threatening
the
federal
force
there
with
washington
in
perspective
relieve
the
heavy
pressure
upon
the
main
arena
jackson
carried
out
these
instructions
with
the
vigor
which
marked
all
his
operations
in
march
he
advanced
down
the
valley
in
the
direction
of
winchester
and
coming
upon
a
considerable
force
of
the
enemy
at
kernstown
made
a
vigorous
assault
upon
them
a
heavy
engagement
ensued
and
though
jackson
was
defeated
and
compelled
to
retreat
a
very
large
federal
force
was
retained
in
the
valley
to
protect
that
important
region
a
more
decisive
diversion
soon
followed
jackson
advanced
in
may
upon
general
banks
then
at
strasburg
drove
him
from
that
point
to
and
across
the
potomac
and
such
was
the
apprehension
felt
at
washington
that
president
lincoln
ordered
general
mcdowell
then
at
fredericksburg
with
about
forty
thousand
men
to
send
twenty
thousand
across
the
mountains
to
strasburg
in
order
to
pursue
or
cut
off
jackson
thus
the
whole
federal
programme
in
virginia
was
thrown
into
confusion
general
banks
after
the
fight
at
kernstown
was
kept
in
the
valley
after
jackson
second
attack
upon
him
when
general
banks
was
driven
across
the
potomac
and
washington
threatened
general
mcdowell
was
directed
to
send
half
his
army
to
operate
against
jackson
thus
general
mcclellan
waiting
at
richmond
for
mcdowell
to
join
him
did
not
move
with
a
portion
of
his
army
on
one
side
of
the
stream
and
the
remainder
on
the
other
side
he
remained
inactive
hesitating
and
unwilling
as
any
good
soldier
would
have
been
to
commence
the
decisive
assault
his
indecision
was
brought
to
an
end
by
general
johnston
discovering
that
the
force
in
his
front
near
seven
pines
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
chickahominy
was
only
a
portion
of
the
federal
army
general
johnston
determined
to
attack
it
this
resolution
was
not
in
consequence
of
the
freshet
in
the
chickahominy
as
has
been
supposed
prompting
johnston
to
attack
while
the
federal
army
was
cut
in
two
as
it
were
his
resolution
he
states
had
already
been
taken
and
was
with
or
without
reference
to
the
rains
that
of
a
good
soldier
general
johnston
struck
at
general
mcclellan
on
the
last
day
of
may
just
at
the
moment
it
appears
when
the
federal
commander
designed
commencing
his
last
advance
upon
the
city
the
battle
which
took
place
was
one
of
the
most
desperate
and
bloody
of
the
war
both
sides
fought
with
obstinate
courage
and
neither
gained
a
decisive
advantage
on
the
confederate
right
near
seven
pines
the
federal
line
was
broken
and
forced
back
but
on
the
left
at
fair
oaks
station
the
confederates
in
turn
were
repulsed
night
fell
upon
a
field
where
neither
side
could
claim
the
victory
the
most
that
could
be
claimed
by
the
southerners
was
that
mcclellan
had
received
a
severe
check
and
they
sustained
a
great
misfortune
in
the
wound
received
by
general
johnston
he
was
struck
by
a
fragment
of
shell
while
superintending
the
attack
at
fair
oaks
and
the
nature
of
his
wound
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
retain
command
of
the
army
he
therefore
retired
from
the
command
and
repaired
to
richmond
where
he
remained
for
a
long
time
an
invalid
wholly
unable
to
continue
in
service
in
the
field
this
untoward
event
rendered
it
necessary
to
find
a
new
commander
for
the
army
without
loss
of
time
general
lee
had
returned
some
time
before
from
the
south
and
to
him
all
eyes
were
turned
he
had
had
no
opportunity
to
display
his
abilities
upon
a
conspicuous
theatre
the
sole
command
he
had
been
intrusted
with
that
in
virginia
could
scarcely
be
called
a
real
command
and
he
owed
his
elevation
now
to
the
place
vacated
by
general
johnston
rather
to
his
services
performed
in
the
old
army
of
the
united
states
than
to
any
thing
he
had
effected
in
the
war
of
the
confederacy
the
confidence
of
the
virginia
people
in
his
great
abilities
had
never
wavered
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
confederate
authorities
were
backward
in
conceding
his
merits
as
a
soldier
whatever
may
have
been
the
considerations
leading
to
his
appointment
he
was
assigned
on
the
day
of
june
to
the
command
of
the
army
and
thus
the
virginians
assembled
to
defend
the
capital
of
their
state
found
themselves
under
the
command
of
the
most
illustrious
of
their
own
countrymen
iii
lee
assigned
to
the
command
his
family
at
the
white
house
lee
had
up
to
this
time
effected
as
we
have
shown
almost
nothing
in
the
progress
of
the
war
intrusted
with
no
command
and
employed
only
in
organizing
the
forces
or
superintending
the
construction
of
defences
he
had
failed
to
achieve
any
of
those
successes
in
the
field
which
constitute
the
glory
of
the
soldier
he
might
possess
the
great
abilities
which
his
friends
and
admirers
claimed
for
him
but
he
was
yet
to
show
the
world
at
large
that
he
did
really
possess
them
the
decisive
moment
had
now
arrived
which
was
to
test
him
he
was
placed
in
command
of
the
largest
and
most
important
army
in
the
confederacy
and
to
him
was
intrusted
the
defence
of
the
capital
not
only
of
virginia
but
of
the
south
if
richmond
were
to
fall
the
confederate
congress
executive
and
heads
of
departments
would
all
be
fugitives
the
evacuation
of
virginia
might
or
might
not
follow
but
in
the
very
commencement
of
the
conflict
the
enemy
would
achieve
an
immense
advantage
recognition
by
the
european
powers
would
be
hopeless
in
such
an
event
and
the
wandering
and
fugitive
government
of
the
confederacy
would
excite
only
contempt
such
were
the
circumstances
under
which
general
lee
assumed
command
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
as
it
was
soon
afterward
styled
the
date
of
his
assignment
to
duty
was
june
three
days
after
general
johnston
had
retired
in
consequence
of
his
wound
thirty
days
afterward
the
great
campaign
around
richmond
had
been
decided
and
to
the
narrative
of
what
followed
the
appointment
of
lee
we
shall
at
once
proceed
after
giving
a
few
words
to
another
subject
connected
with
his
family
when
general
lee
left
washington
to
repair
to
richmond
he
removed
the
ladies
of
his
family
from
arlington
to
the
white
house
on
the
pamunkey
near
the
spot
where
that
river
unites
with
the
mattapony
to
form
the
york
river
this
estate
like
the
arlington
property
had
come
into
possession
of
general
lee
through
his
wife
and
as
arlington
was
exposed
to
the
enemy
the
ladies
had
taken
refuge
here
with
the
hope
that
they
would
be
safe
from
intrusion
or
danger
the
result
was
unfortunate
the
white
house
was
a
favorable
base
for
the
federal
army
and
intelligence
one
day
reached
lee
and
her
family
that
the
enemy
were
approaching
the
ladies
therefore
hastened
from
the
place
to
a
point
of
greater
safety
and
before
her
departure
lee
is
said
to
have
affixed
to
the
door
a
paper
containing
the
following
words
northern
soldiers
who
profess
to
reverence
washington
forbear
to
desecrate
the
home
of
his
first
married
life
the
property
of
his
wife
now
owned
by
her
descendants
a
of
mrs
washington
when
the
federal
forces
took
possession
of
the
place
a
northern
officer
it
is
said
wrote
beneath
this
a
northern
officer
has
protected
your
property
in
sight
of
the
enemy
and
at
the
request
of
your
overseer
the
resolute
spirit
of
lee
is
indicated
by
an
incident
which
followed
she
took
refuge
with
her
daughters
in
a
friend
house
near
richmond
and
when
a
federal
officer
was
sent
to
search
the
house
handed
to
him
a
paper
addressed
to
the
general
in
command
in
which
she
wrote
sir
i
have
patiently
and
humbly
submitted
to
the
search
of
my
house
by
men
under
your
command
who
are
satisfied
that
there
is
nothing
here
which
they
want
all
the
plate
and
other
valuables
have
long
since
been
removed
to
richmond
and
are
now
beyond
the
reach
of
any
northern
marauders
who
may
wish
for
their
possession
wife
of
robert
lee
general
the
ladies
finally
repaired
for
safety
to
the
city
of
richmond
and
the
white
house
was
burned
either
before
or
when
general
mcclellan
retreated
the
place
was
not
without
historic
interest
as
the
scene
of
washington
first
interview
with
martha
custis
who
afterward
became
his
wife
he
was
married
either
at
peter
church
near
by
or
in
the
house
which
originally
stood
on
the
site
of
the
one
now
destroyed
by
the
federal
forces
its
historic
associations
thus
failed
to
protect
the
white
house
and
like
arlington
it
fell
a
sacrifice
to
the
pitiless
hand
of
war
from
this
species
of
digression
we
come
back
to
the
narrative
of
public
events
and
the
history
of
the
great
series
of
battles
which
were
to
make
the
banks
of
the
chickahominy
historic
ground
on
taking
command
lee
had
assiduously
addressed
himself
to
the
task
of
increasing
the
efficiency
of
the
army
riding
incessantly
to
and
fro
he
had
inspected
with
his
own
eyes
the
condition
of
the
troops
officers
of
the
commissary
quartermaster
and
ordnance
departments
were
held
to
a
strict
accountability
and
in
a
short
time
the
army
was
in
a
high
state
of
efficiency
what
was
the
amount
of
the
confederate
force
under
command
of
lee
it
may
be
asked
the
present
writer
is
unable
to
state
this
number
with
any
thing
like
exactness
the
official
record
if
in
existence
is
not
accessible
and
the
matter
must
be
left
to
conjecture
it
is
tolerably
certain
however
that
even
after
the
arrival
of
jackson
the
army
numbered
less
than
thousand
officers
of
high
rank
and
character
state
the
whole
force
to
have
been
sixty
or
seventy
thousand
only
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
the
federal
army
was
larger
than
the
confederate
but
this
was
comparatively
an
unimportant
fact
the
event
was
decided
rather
by
generalship
than
the
numbers
of
the
combatants
iv
lee
resolves
to
attack
general
lee
assumed
command
of
the
army
on
the
of
june
a
week
afterward
jackson
finished
the
great
campaign
of
the
valley
by
defeating
generals
fremont
and
shields
at
port
republic
such
had
been
the
important
services
performed
by
the
famous
stonewall
jackson
who
was
to
become
the
right
arm
of
lee
in
the
greater
campaigns
of
the
future
retreating
after
the
defeat
of
general
banks
and
passing
through
strasburg
just
as
fremont
from
the
west
and
the
twenty
thousand
men
of
general
mcdowell
from
the
east
rushed
to
intercept
him
jackson
had
sullenly
fallen
back
up
the
valley
with
all
his
captured
stores
and
prisoners
and
at
cross
keys
and
port
republic
had
achieved
a
complete
victory
over
his
two
adversaries
fremont
was
checked
by
ewell
who
then
hastened
across
to
take
part
in
the
attack
on
shields
the
result
was
a
federal
defeat
and
retreat
down
the
valley
jackson
was
free
to
move
in
any
direction
and
his
army
could
unite
with
that
at
richmond
for
a
decisive
attack
upon
general
mcclellan
the
attack
in
question
had
speedily
been
resolved
on
by
lee
any
further
advance
of
the
federal
army
would
bring
it
up
to
the
very
earthworks
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
and
unless
the
confederate
authorities
proposed
to
undergo
a
siege
it
was
necessary
to
check
the
further
advance
of
the
enemy
by
a
general
attack
how
to
attack
to
the
best
advantage
was
now
the
question
the
position
of
general
mcclellan
army
has
been
briefly
stated
advancing
up
the
peninsula
he
had
reached
and
passed
the
chickahominy
and
was
in
sight
of
richmond
to
this
stream
the
natural
line
of
defence
of
the
city
on
the
north
and
east
numerous
roads
diverged
from
the
capital
including
the
york
river
railroad
of
which
the
federal
commander
made
such
excellent
use
and
general
mcclellan
had
thrown
his
left
wing
across
the
stream
advancing
to
a
point
on
the
railroad
four
or
five
miles
from
the
city
here
he
had
erected
heavy
defences
to
protect
that
wing
until
the
right
wing
crossed
in
turn
the
tangled
thickets
of
the
swamp
on
his
left
flank
were
a
natural
defence
but
he
had
added
to
these
obstacles
as
we
have
stated
by
felling
trees
and
guarding
every
approach
by
redoubts
in
these
heavy
artillery
kept
watch
against
an
approaching
enemy
and
any
attempt
to
attack
from
that
quarter
seemed
certain
to
result
in
repulse
in
front
toward
seven
pines
the
chance
of
success
was
equally
doubtful
the
excellent
works
of
the
federal
commander
bristled
with
artillery
and
were
heavily
manned
it
seemed
thus
absolutely
necessary
to
discover
some
other
point
of
assault
and
as
the
federal
right
beyond
the
chickahominy
was
the
only
point
left
it
was
determined
to
attack
if
possible
in
that
quarter
an
important
question
was
first
however
to
be
decided
the
character
of
the
defences
if
any
on
general
mcclellan
right
in
the
direction
of
old
church
and
cold
harbor
a
reconnoissance
in
force
was
necessary
to
acquire
this
information
and
general
lee
accordingly
directed
general
stuart
commanding
the
cavalry
of
the
army
to
proceed
with
a
portion
of
his
command
to
the
vicinity
of
old
church
in
the
federal
rear
and
gain
all
the
information
possible
of
their
position
and
defences
stuart
ride
around
mcclellan
general
james
stuart
who
now
made
his
first
prominent
appearance
upon
the
theatre
of
the
war
was
a
virginian
by
birth
and
not
yet
thirty
years
of
age
resigning
his
commission
of
lieutenant
in
the
united
states
cavalry
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
he
had
joined
johnston
in
the
valley
and
impressed
that
officer
with
a
high
opinion
of
his
abilities
as
a
cavalry
officer
proceeded
thence
to
manassas
where
he
charged
and
broke
a
company
of
zouave
infantry
protected
the
rear
of
the
army
when
johnston
retired
to
the
rappahannock
and
bore
an
active
part
in
the
conflict
on
the
peninsula
in
person
he
was
of
medium
height
his
frame
was
broad
and
powerful
he
wore
a
heavy
brown
beard
flowing
upon
his
breast
a
huge
mustache
of
the
same
color
the
ends
curling
upward
and
the
blue
eyes
flashing
beneath
a
forehead
had
at
times
the
dazzling
brilliancy
attributed
to
the
eyes
of
the
eagle
fond
of
movement
adventure
bright
colors
and
all
the
pomp
and
pageantry
of
war
stuart
had
entered
on
the
struggle
with
ardor
and
enjoyed
it
as
the
huntsman
enjoys
the
chase
young
ardent
ambitious
as
brave
as
steel
ready
with
jest
or
laughter
with
his
following
him
going
into
the
hottest
battles
humming
a
song
this
young
virginian
was
in
truth
an
original
character
and
impressed
powerfully
all
who
approached
him
one
who
knew
him
well
wrote
every
thing
striking
brilliant
and
picturesque
seemed
to
centre
in
him
the
war
seemed
to
be
to
stuart
a
splendid
and
exciting
game
in
which
his
blood
coursed
joyously
and
his
immensely
strong
physical
organization
found
an
arena
for
the
display
of
all
its
faculties
the
affluent
life
of
the
man
craved
those
perils
and
hardships
which
flush
the
pulses
and
make
the
heart
beat
fast
he
swung
himself
into
the
saddle
at
the
sound
of
the
bugle
as
the
hunter
springs
on
horseback
and
at
such
moments
his
cheeks
glowed
and
his
huge
mustache
curled
with
enjoyment
the
romance
and
poetry
of
the
hard
trade
of
arms
seemed
first
to
be
inaugurated
when
this
joyous
cavalier
with
his
floating
plume
and
splendid
laughter
appeared
upon
the
great
arena
of
the
war
in
virginia
precise
people
shook
their
heads
and
called
him
frivolous
undervaluing
his
great
ability
those
best
capable
of
judging
him
were
of
a
different
opinion
johnston
wrote
to
him
from
the
west
how
can
i
eat
or
sleep
in
peace
without
upon
the
outpost
jackson
said
when
he
fell
at
chancellorsville
go
back
to
general
stuart
and
tell
him
to
act
upon
his
own
judgment
and
do
what
he
thinks
best
i
have
implicit
confidence
in
him
lee
said
when
he
was
killed
at
yellow
tavern
i
can
scarcely
think
of
him
without
weeping
and
the
brave
general
sedgwick
of
the
united
states
army
said
stuart
is
the
best
cavalry
officer
ever
in
north
america
in
the
summer
of
when
we
present
him
to
the
reader
stuart
had
as
yet
achieved
little
fame
in
his
profession
but
he
was
burning
to
distinguish
himself
he
responded
ardently
therefore
to
the
order
of
lee
and
was
soon
ready
with
a
picked
force
of
about
fifteen
hundred
cavalry
under
some
of
his
best
officers
among
them
were
colonels
william
lee
and
lee
the
first
a
son
of
general
lee
a
graduate
of
west
point
and
an
officer
of
distinction
afterward
the
second
a
son
of
smith
lee
brother
of
the
general
and
famous
subsequently
in
the
most
brilliant
scenes
of
the
war
as
the
gay
and
gallant
general
fitz
lee
of
the
cavalry
with
his
picked
force
officered
by
the
two
lees
and
other
excellent
lieutenants
stuart
set
out
on
his
adventurous
expedition
to
old
church
he
effected
more
than
he
anticipated
and
performed
a
daring
feat
of
arms
in
addition
driving
the
outposts
from
hanover
he
charged
and
broke
a
force
of
federal
cavalry
near
old
church
pushed
on
to
the
york
river
railroad
which
he
crossed
burning
or
capturing
all
federal
stores
met
with
including
enormous
and
then
finding
the
way
back
barred
against
him
and
the
federal
army
on
the
alert
he
continued
his
march
with
rapidity
passed
entirely
around
general
mcclellan
army
and
building
a
bridge
over
the
chickahominy
safely
reëntered
the
confederate
lines
just
as
a
large
force
made
its
appearance
in
his
rear
the
temporary
bridge
was
destroyed
however
and
stuart
hastened
to
report
to
his
superiors
his
information
was
important
general
mcclellan
right
and
rear
were
unprotected
by
works
of
any
strength
if
the
confederate
general
desired
to
attack
in
that
quarter
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
results
of
stuart
famous
ride
around
mcclellan
as
the
people
called
it
determined
general
lee
to
make
the
attack
on
the
north
bank
of
the
stream
if
he
had
not
already
so
decided
it
was
necessary
now
to
bring
jackson
forces
from
the
valley
without
delay
and
almost
equally
important
to
mask
the
movement
from
general
mcclellan
to
this
end
a
very
simple
was
adopted
on
the
of
june
division
was
embarked
on
the
cars
of
the
danville
railroad
at
richmond
and
moved
across
the
river
to
a
point
near
belle
isle
where
at
that
moment
a
considerable
number
of
federal
prisoners
were
about
to
be
released
and
sent
down
james
river
here
the
train
loaded
with
confederate
troops
remained
for
some
time
and
was
discovered
by
the
released
prisoners
general
lee
was
reënforcing
jackson
in
order
that
the
latter
might
march
on
washington
such
was
the
report
carried
to
general
mcclellan
and
it
seems
to
have
really
deceived
him
footnote
i
have
no
doubt
jackson
has
been
reënforced
from
here
mcclellan
to
president
lincoln
june
whiting
division
reached
lynchburg
and
was
thence
moved
by
railway
to
charlottesville
jackson
marched
and
countermarched
with
an
elaborate
pretence
of
advancing
down
the
valley
at
last
one
morning
the
astute
confederate
who
kept
his
own
counsels
had
disappeared
he
was
marching
rapidly
to
join
lee
on
the
chickahominy
not
even
his
own
soldiers
knew
what
direction
they
were
taking
they
were
forbidden
by
general
order
to
inquire
even
the
names
of
the
towns
they
passed
through
directed
to
reply
i
do
know
to
every
question
and
it
is
said
that
when
jackson
demanded
the
name
and
regiment
of
a
soldier
robbing
a
he
could
extract
from
the
man
no
reply
but
i
do
know
jackson
advanced
with
rapidity
and
on
the
of
june
was
near
ashland
here
he
left
his
forces
and
rode
on
rapidly
to
richmond
passing
unrecognized
through
the
streets
after
night
he
went
on
to
general
lee
headquarters
at
a
house
on
the
road
leading
from
the
new
bridge
road
toward
fair
oaks
station
and
here
took
place
the
first
interview
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
between
lee
and
jackson
what
each
thought
of
the
other
will
be
shown
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
we
shall
proceed
now
with
the
history
of
the
great
series
of
battles
for
which
jackson
appearance
was
the
signal
part
iii
the
i
the
two
armies
the
chickahominy
whose
banks
were
now
to
be
the
scene
of
a
bitter
and
determined
conflict
between
the
great
adversaries
is
a
sluggish
and
winding
stream
which
rising
above
richmond
describes
a
curve
around
it
and
empties
its
waters
into
the
james
far
below
the
city
its
banks
are
swampy
and
thickly
clothed
with
forest
or
underwood
from
the
nature
of
these
banks
which
scarcely
rise
in
many
places
above
the
level
of
the
water
the
least
freshet
produces
an
overflow
and
the
stream
generally
narrow
and
insignificant
becomes
a
sort
of
lake
covering
the
low
grounds
to
the
bases
of
the
wooded
bluffs
extending
upon
each
side
numerous
bridges
cross
the
stream
from
bottom
bridge
below
the
york
river
railroad
to
meadow
bridge
north
of
the
city
of
these
the
mechanicsville
bridge
about
four
miles
from
the
city
and
the
new
bridge
about
nine
miles
were
points
of
the
greatest
importance
general
mcclellan
position
has
been
repeatedly
referred
to
he
had
crossed
a
portion
of
his
army
east
of
richmond
and
advanced
to
within
four
or
five
miles
of
the
city
the
remainder
meanwhile
lay
on
the
north
bank
of
the
stream
and
swept
round
in
a
sort
of
crescent
to
the
vicinity
of
mechanicsville
where
it
had
been
anticipated
general
mcdowell
would
unite
with
it
thereby
covering
its
right
flank
and
protecting
the
communications
with
the
federal
base
at
the
white
house
that
this
disposition
of
the
federal
troops
was
faulty
in
face
of
adversaries
like
johnston
and
lee
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
general
mcclellan
was
the
victim
it
seems
of
the
shifting
and
vacillating
policy
of
the
authorities
at
washington
with
the
arrival
of
the
forty
thousand
men
under
mcdowell
his
position
would
have
been
a
safe
one
general
mcdowell
did
not
arrive
and
this
unprotected
right
flank
left
unprotected
from
the
fact
that
mcdowell
presence
was
counted
on
became
the
point
of
the
confederate
attack
the
amount
of
blame
if
any
justly
attributable
to
general
mcclellan
first
for
his
inactivity
and
then
for
his
defeat
by
lee
can
not
be
referred
to
here
save
in
a
few
brief
sentences
a
sort
of
feud
seems
to
have
arisen
between
himself
and
general
halleck
the
stationed
at
washington
and
general
halleck
then
and
afterward
appears
to
have
regarded
mcclellan
as
a
soldier
without
decision
or
broad
generalship
and
yet
mcclellan
does
not
seem
to
have
merited
the
censure
he
received
he
called
persistently
for
reinforcements
remaining
inactive
meanwhile
because
he
estimated
the
confederate
army
before
him
at
two
hundred
thousand
men
and
was
unwilling
to
assail
this
force
under
command
of
soldiers
like
johnston
and
lee
until
his
own
force
seemed
adequate
to
the
undertaking
another
consideration
was
the
confederate
position
in
front
of
the
powerful
earthworks
of
the
city
these
works
would
double
the
confederate
strength
in
case
of
battle
in
front
of
them
and
believing
himself
already
outnumbered
the
federal
commander
was
naturally
loath
to
deliver
battle
until
reënforced
the
faulty
disposition
of
his
army
divided
by
a
stream
crossed
by
few
bridges
has
been
accounted
for
in
like
manner
he
so
disposed
the
troops
expecting
reënforcements
but
jackson
energy
delayed
these
washington
was
in
danger
it
was
supposed
and
general
mcdowell
did
not
come
it
thus
happened
that
general
mcclellan
awaited
attack
instead
of
making
it
and
that
his
army
was
so
posted
as
to
expose
him
to
the
greatest
peril
a
last
point
is
to
be
noted
in
vindication
of
this
able
soldier
finding
at
the
very
last
moment
that
he
could
expect
no
further
assistance
from
the
president
or
general
halleck
he
resolved
promptly
to
withdraw
his
exposed
right
wing
and
change
his
base
of
operations
to
james
river
where
at
least
his
communications
would
be
safe
this
it
seems
had
been
determined
upon
just
before
the
confederate
attack
or
if
he
had
not
then
decided
general
mcclellan
soon
determined
upon
that
plan
to
pass
now
to
the
confederate
side
where
all
was
ready
for
the
great
movement
general
lee
army
lay
in
front
of
richmond
exactly
corresponding
with
the
front
of
general
mcclellan
the
divisions
of
magruder
and
huger
supported
by
those
of
longstreet
and
hill
were
opposite
mcclellan
left
on
the
williamsburg
and
york
river
roads
directly
east
of
the
city
from
magruder
left
extended
the
division
of
general
hill
reaching
thence
up
the
river
toward
mechanicsville
and
a
brigade
under
general
branch
lay
on
hill
left
near
the
point
where
the
brook
turnpike
crosses
the
chickahominy
north
of
richmond
the
approaches
from
the
east
northeast
and
north
were
thus
carefully
guarded
as
the
confederates
held
the
interior
line
the
whole
force
could
be
rapidly
concentrated
and
was
thoroughly
in
hand
both
for
offensive
or
defensive
movements
the
army
thus
held
in
lee
grasp
and
about
to
assail
its
great
federal
adversary
was
composed
of
the
best
portion
of
the
southern
population
the
rank
and
file
was
largely
made
up
of
men
of
education
and
high
social
position
and
this
resulted
from
the
character
of
the
struggle
the
war
was
a
war
of
invasion
on
the
part
of
the
north
and
the
ardent
and
youth
of
the
entire
south
threw
themselves
into
it
with
enthusiasm
the
heirs
of
ancient
families
and
great
wealth
served
as
privates
personal
pride
love
of
country
indignation
at
the
thought
that
a
hostile
section
had
sent
an
army
to
reduce
them
to
submission
combined
to
draw
into
the
confederate
ranks
the
flower
of
the
southern
youth
and
all
the
best
fighting
material
deficient
in
discipline
and
hard
to
manage
this
force
was
yet
of
the
most
efficient
character
it
could
be
counted
on
for
hard
work
and
especially
for
offensive
operations
and
the
officers
placed
over
it
shared
its
character
among
these
general
hill
a
virginian
by
birth
was
soon
to
be
conspicuous
as
commander
of
the
light
division
and
representative
of
the
spirit
and
dash
and
enthusiasm
of
the
army
under
forty
years
of
age
with
a
slender
figure
a
face
dark
eyes
a
composed
and
unassuming
bearing
characterized
when
off
duty
by
a
quiet
cordiality
he
was
personally
popular
with
all
who
approached
him
and
greatly
beloved
both
as
man
and
commander
his
chief
merit
as
a
soldier
was
his
dash
and
impetus
in
the
charge
a
braver
heart
never
beat
in
human
breast
throughout
the
war
he
retained
the
respect
and
admiration
of
the
army
and
the
country
and
a
strange
fact
in
relation
to
this
eminent
soldier
is
that
his
name
was
uttered
by
both
jackson
and
lee
as
they
expired
associated
with
him
in
the
battles
of
the
chickahominy
and
to
the
end
was
the
able
and
resolute
longstreet
an
officer
of
low
and
powerful
stature
with
a
heavy
brown
beard
reaching
to
his
breast
a
manner
marked
by
unalterable
composure
and
a
countenance
whose
expression
of
phlegmatic
tranquillity
never
varied
in
the
hottest
hours
of
battle
longstreet
was
as
famous
for
his
obstinacy
as
hill
for
his
dash
and
enthusiasm
general
lee
styled
him
his
old
and
depended
upon
him
as
will
be
seen
in
some
of
the
most
critical
operations
of
the
war
of
the
young
and
ardent
virginian
general
magruder
the
brave
and
resolute
hill
and
other
officers
who
subsequently
acquired
great
reputations
in
the
army
we
have
no
space
at
present
to
speak
all
were
to
coöperate
in
the
assault
on
general
mcclellan
and
do
their
part
on
the
night
of
the
of
june
all
was
ready
for
the
important
movement
and
the
troops
rested
on
their
arms
ready
for
the
coming
battle
ii
lee
plan
of
assault
general
lee
had
been
hitherto
regarded
as
a
soldier
of
too
great
caution
but
his
plan
for
the
assault
on
general
mcclellan
indicated
the
possession
of
a
nerve
approaching
audacity
fully
comprehending
his
enemy
strength
and
position
and
aware
that
a
large
portion
of
the
federal
army
had
crossed
the
chickahominy
and
was
directly
in
his
front
he
had
resolved
to
pass
to
the
north
bank
of
the
stream
with
the
bulk
of
his
force
leaving
only
about
thousand
men
to
protect
the
city
and
deliver
battle
where
defeat
would
prove
ruinous
this
plan
indicated
nothing
less
than
audacity
as
we
have
already
said
but
like
the
audacity
of
the
flank
movement
at
chancellorsville
afterward
and
the
daring
march
in
disregard
of
general
hooker
to
pennsylvania
in
it
was
founded
on
profound
military
insight
and
indicated
the
qualities
of
a
great
soldier
lee
design
was
to
attack
the
federal
right
wing
with
a
part
of
his
force
while
jackson
advancing
still
farther
to
the
left
came
in
on
their
communications
with
the
white
house
and
assailed
them
on
their
right
and
rear
meanwhile
richmond
was
to
be
protected
by
general
magruder
with
his
thousand
men
on
the
south
bank
if
mcclellan
fell
back
down
the
peninsula
this
force
was
to
cross
and
unite
with
the
rest
thus
the
federal
army
would
be
driven
from
all
its
positions
and
the
fate
of
the
whole
campaign
against
richmond
would
be
decided
lee

given
it
possesses
interest
as
a
clear
and
detailed
statement
of

operations
and
it
will
be

that
what
was
resolved
on
by
the

iii
the
battle
of
the
chickahominy
on
the
morning
of
the
of
june
all
was
ready
for
the
great
encounter
of
arms
between
the
confederates
and
the
federal
forces
on
the
chickahominy
general
jackson
had
been
delayed
on
his
march
from
the
mountains
and
had
not
yet
arrived
but
it
was
known
that
he
was
near
and
would
soon
make
his
appearance
and
in
the
afternoon
general
lee
accordingly
directed
that
the
movement
should
commence
at
the
word
general
hill
moved
from
his
camps
to
meadow
bridge
north
of
richmond
crossed
the
chickahominy
there
and
moved
rapidly
on
mechanicsville
where
a
small
federal
force
behind
intrenchments
guarded
the
head
of
the
bridge
this
force
was
not
a
serious
obstacle
and
hill
soon
disposed
of
it
he
attacked
the
federal
works
stormed
them
after
a
brief
struggle
and
drove
the
force
which
had
occupied
them
back
toward
beaver
dam
creek
below
the
mechanicsville
bridge
was
thus
cleared
and
in
compliance
with
his
orders
from
lee
general
longstreet
hastened
to
throw
his
division
across
hill
had
meanwhile
pressed
forward
on
the
track
of
the
retreating
enemy
and
a
mile
or
two
below
found
himself
in
front
of
a
much
more
serious
obstruction
than
that
encountered
at
the
bridge
namely
the
formidable
position
held
by
the
enemy
on
beaver
dam
creek
the
ground
here
is
of
a
peculiar
character
and
admirably
adapted
for
a
defensive
position
against
an
enemy
advancing
from
above
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
narrow
valley
through
which
runs
beaver
dam
creek
rises
a
bold
almost
precipitous
bluff
and
the
road
which
the
confederates
were
compelled
to
take
bends
abruptly
to
the
right
when
near
the
stream
thus
exposing
the
flank
of
the
assaulting
party
to
a
fire
from
the
bluff
as
hill
column
pushed
forward
to
attack
this
position
it
was
met
by
a
determined
fire
of
artillery
and
from
the
crest
beyond
the
stream
where
a
large
force
of
riflemen
in
pits
were
posted
with
infantry
supports
before
this
raking
his
flanks
and
doing
heavy
execution
hill
was
compelled
to
fall
back
it
was
impossible
to
cross
the
stream
in
face
of
the
fusillade
and
cannon
the
attack
ended
after
dark
with
the
withdrawal
of
the
confederates
but
at
dawn
hill
resumed
the
struggle
attempting
to
cross
at
another
point
lower
down
the
stream
this
attempt
was
in
progress
when
the
federal
troops
were
seen
rapidly
falling
back
from
their
strong
position
and
intelligence
soon
came
that
this
was
in
consequence
of
the
arrival
of
jackson
who
had
passed
around
the
federal
right
flank
above
and
forced
them
to
retire
toward
the
main
body
of
the
federal
army
below
no
time
was
now
lost
the
memorable
of
june
had
dawned
clear
and
cloudless
and
the
brilliant
sunshine
gave
promise
of
a
day
on
which
no
interference
of
the
elements
would
check
the
bloody
work
to
be
performed
hill
advanced
steadily
on
the
track
of
the
retiring
federal
forces
who
had
left
evidences
of
their
precipitate
retreat
all
along
the
road
and
about
noon
came
in
front
of
the
very
powerful
position
of
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
near
cold
harbor
general
mcclellan
had
drawn
up
his
forces
on
a
ridge
along
the
southern
bank
of
powhite
creek
a
small
which
flowing
from
the
northeast
empties
below
new
bridge
into
the
chickahominy
his
left
nearest
the
chickahominy
was
protected
by
a
deep
ravine
in
front
which
he
had
filled
with
and
his
right
rested
upon
elevated
ground
near
the
locality
known
as
maghee
house
in
front
the
whole
line
of
battle
which
described
a
curve
backward
to
cover
the
bridges
in
rear
was
protected
by
difficult
approaches
the
ground
was
either
swampy
or
covered
with
tangled
undergrowth
or
both
the
ridge
held
by
the
federal
forces
had
been
hastily
fortified
by
breastworks
of
felled
trees
and
earth
behind
which
the
long
lines
of
infantry
supported
by
numerous
artillery
awaited
the
attack
the
amount
of
the
federal
force
has
been
variously
stated
the
impression
of
the
confederates
differed
from
the
subsequent
statements
of
federal
writers
the
principal
part
of
the
federal
army
says
general
lee
in
his
report
was
now
on
the
north
side
of
the
chickahominy
the
force
has
been
placed
by
northern
writers
at
only
thirty
or
at
most
thousand
if
this
was
the
whole
number
of
troops
engaged
from
first
to
last
in
the
battle
the
fact
is
highly
creditable
to
the
federal
arms
as
the
struggle
was
long
doubtful
no
doubt
the
exact
truth
will
some
day
be
put
upon
record
and
justice
will
be
done
to
both
the
adversaries
the
federal
force
was
commanded
by
the
brave
and
able
general
porter
with
general
morell
commanding
his
right
general
sykes
his
left
and
general
mccall
forming
a
second
line
division
and
the
brigades
of
generals
french
and
meagher
afterward
reënforced
porter
who
now
prepared
with
great
coolness
for
the
confederate
attack
the
moment
had
come
hill
pressing
forward
rapidly
with
longstreet
division
on
the
right
reached
cold
harbor
in
front
of
the
federal
centre
about
noon
hill
immediately
attacked
and
an
engagement
of
the
most
obstinate
character
ensued
general
lee
accompanied
by
general
longstreet
had
ridden
from
his
headquarters
on
the
road
to
the
scene
of
action
and
now
witnessed
in
person
the
fighting
of
the
troops
who
charged
under
his
eye
closing
in
in
a
nearly
conflict
with
the
enemy
this
was
no
doubt
the
first
occasion
on
which
a
considerable
portion
of
the
men
had
seen
him
certainly
in
battle
and
that
air
of
supreme
calmness
which
always
characterized
him
in
action
must
have
made
a
deep
impression
upon
them
he
was
clad
simply
and
wore
scarcely
any
badges
of
rank
a
felt
hat
drooped
low
over
the
broad
forehead
and
the
eyes
beneath
were
calm
and
unclouded
add
a
voice
of
measured
calmness
the
air
of
immovable
composure
which
marked
the
erect
military
figure
evidently
at
home
in
the
saddle
and
the
reader
will
have
a
correct
conception
of
general
lee
personal
appearance
in
the
first
of
the
great
battles
of
his
career
hill
attacked
with
that
dash
and
obstinacy
which
from
this
time
forward
characterized
him
but
succeeded
in
making
no
impression
on
the
federal
line
in
every
assault
he
was
repulsed
with
heavy
loss
the
federal
artillery
which
was
handled
with
skill
and
coolness
did
great
execution
upon
his
column
as
it
rushed
forward
and
the
infantry
behind
their
works
stood
firm
in
spite
of
the
most
determined
efforts
to
drive
them
from
the
ridge
three
of
hill
regiments
reached
the
crest
and
fought
hand
to
hand
over
the
breastworks
but
they
were
speedily
repulsed
and
driven
from
the
crest
and
after
two
hours
hard
fighting
hill
found
that
he
had
lost
heavily
and
effected
nothing
it
was
now
past
two
in
the
afternoon
and
general
lee
listened
with
anxiety
for
the
sound
of
guns
from
the
left
which
would
herald
the
approach
of
general
jackson
nothing
was
heard
from
that
quarter
however
and
affairs
were
growing
critical
the
confederate
attack
had
been
repulsed
the
federal
position
seemed
impregnable
and
it
became
apparent
says
general
lee
that
the
enemy
were
gradually
gaining
ground
under
these
circumstances
general
mcclellan
might
adopt
either
one
of
the
two
courses
both
alike
dangerous
to
the
confederates
he
might
cross
a
heavy
force
to
the
assistance
of
general
porter
thus
enabling
that
officer
to
assume
the
offensive
or
finding
lee
thus
checked
he
might
advance
on
magruder
crush
the
small
force
under
him
and
seize
on
richmond
which
would
be
at
his
mercy
it
was
thus
necessary
to
act
without
delay
while
awaiting
the
appearance
of
jackson
general
lee
accordingly
directed
general
longstreet
who
had
taken
position
to
the
right
of
cold
harbor
to
make
a
feint
against
the
federal
left
and
thus
relieve
the
pressure
on
hill
longstreet
proceeded
with
promptness
to
obey
the
order
advanced
in
face
of
a
heavy
fire
and
with
a
of
artillery
raking
his
right
from
over
the
chickahominy
and
made
the
feint
which
had
been
ordered
by
general
lee
it
effected
nothing
and
to
attain
the
desired
result
it
was
found
necessary
to
turn
the
feint
into
a
real
attack
this
longstreet
proceeded
to
do
first
dispersing
with
a
single
volley
a
force
of
cavalry
which
had
the
temerity
to
charge
his
infantry
as
he
advanced
and
attacked
the
powerful
position
before
him
the
roar
of
guns
succeeded
by
loud
cheers
was
heard
on
the
left
of
lee
line
jackson
had
arrived
and
thrown
his
troops
into
action
without
delay
he
then
rode
forward
to
cold
harbor
where
general
lee
awaited
him
and
the
two
soldiers
shook
hands
in
the
midst
of
tumultuous
cheering
from
the
troops
who
had
received
intelligence
that
jackson
corps
had
joined
them
the
contrast
between
the
two
men
was
extremely
striking
we
have
presented
a
brief
sketch
of
lee
personal
appearance
upon
the
occasion
of
the
grave
with
his
erect
and
graceful
seat
in
the
saddle
his
imposing
dignity
of
demeanor
and
his
calm
and
measured
tones
as
deliberate
as
though
he
were
in
a
jackson
was
a
very
different
personage
he
was
clad
in
a
dingy
old
coat
wore
a
discolored
tilted
almost
upon
his
nose
and
rode
a
rawboned
horse
with
short
stirrups
which
raised
his
knees
in
the
most
ungraceful
manner
neither
in
his
face
nor
figure
was
there
the
least
indication
of
the
great
faculties
of
the
man
and
a
more
personage
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
in
his
hand
he
held
a
lemon
which
he
sucked
from
time
to
time
and
his
demeanor
was
abstracted
and
absent
as
jackson
approached
lee
rode
toward
him
and
greeted
him
with
a
cordial
pressure
of
the
hand
ah
general
said
lee
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
i
hoped
to
be
with
you
before
jackson
made
a
twitching
movement
of
his
head
and
replied
in
a
few
words
rather
jerked
from
the
lips
than
deliberately
uttered
lee
had
paused
and
now
listened
attentively
to
the
long
roll
of
musketry
from
the
woods
where
hill
and
longstreet
were
engaged
then
to
the
still
more
incessant
and
angry
roar
from
the
direction
of
jackson
own
troops
who
had
closed
in
upon
the
federal
forces
that
fire
is
very
heavy
said
lee
do
you
think
your
men
can
stand
it
jackson
listened
for
a
moment
with
his
head
bent
toward
one
shoulder
as
was
customary
with
him
for
he
was
deaf
he
said
in
one
ear
and
could
not
hear
out
of
the
other
and
replied
briefly
they
can
stand
almost
any
thing
they
can
stand
that
he
then
after
receiving
general
lee
instructions
immediately
saluted
and
returned
to
his
corps
lee
remaining
still
at
cold
harbor
which
was
opposite
the
federal
centre
illustration
lee
and
jackson
at
cold
harbor
the
arrival
of
jackson
changed
in
a
moment
the
aspect
of
affairs
in
every
part
of
the
field
whitney
division
of
his
command
took
position
on
longstreet
left
the
command
of
general
hill
on
the
extreme
right
of
the
whole
line
and
ewell
division
with
part
of
jackson
old
division
supported
hill
no
sooner
had
these
dispositions
been
made
than
general
lee
ordered
an
attack
along
the
whole
line
it
was
now
five
or
six
and
the
sun
was
sinking
from
that
moment
until
night
came
the
battle
raged
with
a
fury
unsurpassed
in
any
subsequent
engagement
of
the
war
the
texan
troops
under
general
hood
especially
distinguished
themselves
these
followed
by
their
comrades
charged
the
federal
left
on
the
bluff
and
in
spite
of
a
desperate
resistance
carried
the
position
the
enemy
were
driven
says
general
lee
from
the
ravine
to
the
first
line
of
breastworks
over
which
one
impetuous
column
dashed
up
to
the
intrenchments
on
the
crest
here
the
federal
artillery
was
captured
their
line
driven
from
the
hill
and
in
other
parts
of
the
field
a
similar
success
followed
the
attack
as
night
fell
their
line
gave
way
in
all
parts
and
the
remnants
of
general
porter
command
retreated
to
the
bridges
over
the
chickahominy
the
first
important
passage
of
arms
between
general
mcclellan
and
general
lee
and
it
may
be
added
the
really
decisive
one
had
terminated
in
a
great
success
on
the
side
of
the
confederates
iv
the
retreat
the
battle
of
cold
harbor
or
as
general
lee
styles
it
in
his
report
the
battle
of
the
chickahominy
was
the
decisive
struggle
between
the
great
adversaries
and
determined
the
fate
of
general
campaign
against
richmond
this
view
is
not
held
by
writers
on
the
northern
side
who
represent
the
battle
in
question
as
only
the
first
of
a
series
of
engagements
all
of
pretty
nearly
equal
importance
and
mere
incidents
attending
general
mcclellan
change
of
base
to
the
shores
of
the
james
river
such
a
theory
seems
unfounded
if
the
battle
at
cold
harbor
had
resulted
in
a
federal
victory
general
mcclellan
would
have
advanced
straight
on
richmond
and
the
capture
of
the
city
would
inevitably
have
followed
but
at
cold
harbor
he
sustained
a
decisive
defeat
his
whole
campaign
was
reversed
and
came
to
naught
from
the
events
occurring
between
noon
and
nightfall
on
the
of
june
the
result
of
that
obstinate
encounter
was
not
a
federal
success
leading
to
the
fall
of
richmond
but
a
federal
defeat
which
led
to
the
retreat
to
the
james
river
and
the
failure
of
the
whole
campaign
against
the
confederate
capital
it
is
conceded
that
general
mcclellan
really
intended
to
change
his
base
but
after
the
battle
of
cold
harbor
every
thing
had
changed
he
no
longer
had
under
him
a
army
moving
to
take
up
a
stronger
position
but
a
weary
and
dispirited
multitude
of
human
beings
hurrying
along
to
gain
the
shelter
of
the
gunboats
on
the
james
river
with
the
enemy
pursuing
closely
and
worrying
them
at
every
step
to
the
condition
of
the
federal
army
one
of
their
own
officers
testifies
and
his
expressions
are
so
strong
as
wellnigh
to
move
the
susceptibilities
of
an
opponent
we
were
ordered
to
retreat
says
general
hooker
and
it
was
like
the
retreat
of
a
whipped
army
we
retreated
like
a
parcel
of
sheep
everybody
on
the
road
at
the
same
time
and
a
few
shots
from
the
rebels
would
have
the
whole
command
footnote
report
of
the
committee
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
part
p
such
was
the
condition
of
that
great
army
which
had
fought
so
bravely
standing
firm
so
long
against
the
headlong
assaults
of
the
flower
of
the
southern
troops
it
was
the
battle
at
cold
harbor
which
had
produced
this
state
of
things
thereby
really
deciding
the
result
of
the
campaign
to
attribute
to
that
action
therefore
no
more
importance
than
attached
to
the
engagements
on
the
retreat
to
james
river
seems
in
opposition
to
the
truth
of
history
we
shall
present
only
a
general
narrative
of
the
famous
retreat
which
reflected
the
highest
credit
upon
general
mcclellan
and
will
remain
his
greatest
glory
he
at
least
was
too
good
a
soldier
not
to
understand
that
the
battle
of
the
was
a
decisive
one
he
determined
to
retreat
without
risking
another
action
to
the
banks
of
the
james
river
where
the
federal
gunboats
would
render
a
second
attack
from
the
confederates
a
hazardous
undertaking
and
on
the
evening
of
the
of
june
as
he
says
in
his
official
report
assembled
the
corps
commanders
at
his
headquarters
and
informed
them
of
his
plan
its
reasons
and
his
choice
of
route
and
method
of
execution
orders
were
then
issued
to
general
keyes
to
move
with
his
corps
across
the
swamp
bridge
and
taking
up
a
position
with
his
artillery
on
the
opposite
side
cover
the
passage
of
the
rest
of
the
troops
the
trains
and
supplies
at
savage
station
on
the
york
river
railroad
were
directed
to
be
withdrawn
and
the
corps
commanders
were
ordered
to
move
with
such
provisions
munitions
and
sick
as
they
could
transport
on
the
direct
road
to
landing
these
orders
were
promptly
carried
out
before
dawn
on
the
the
federal
army
took
up
the
line
of
march
and
the
great
retrograde
movement
was
successfully
begun
an
immense
obstacle
to
its
success
lay
in
the
character
of
the
country
through
which
it
was
necessary
to
pass
white
oak
swamp
is
an
extensive
morass
similar
to
that
skirting
the
banks
of
the
chickahominy
and
the
passage
through
it
is
over
narrow
winding
and
difficult
roads
which
furnish
the
worst
possible
pathways
for
wagons
artillery
or
even
troops
it
was
necessary
however
to
use
these
highways
or
none
and
general
mcclellan
resolutely
entered
upon
his
critical
movement
general
lee
was
yet
in
doubt
as
to
his
opponent
designs
and
the
fact
is
highly
creditable
to
general
mcclellan
a
portion
of
the
federal
army
still
remained
on
the
left
bank
of
the
chickahominy
and
it
might
be
the
intention
of
mcclellan
to
push
forward
reënforcements
from
the
peninsula
fight
a
second
battle
for
the
protection
of
his
great
mass
of
supplies
at
the
white
house
or
crossing
his
whole
army
to
the
left
bank
of
the
chickahominy
by
the
lower
bridges
retreat
down
the
peninsula
by
the
same
road
followed
in
advancing
all
that
general
lee
could
do
under
these
circumstances
was
to
remain
near
cold
harbor
with
his
main
body
send
a
force
toward
the
york
river
road
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
chickahominy
to
check
any
federal
attempt
to
cross
there
and
await
further
developments
it
was
not
until
the
morning
of
the
that
general
designs
became
apparent
it
was
then
ascertained
that
he
had
commenced
moving
toward
james
river
with
his
entire
army
and
lee
issued
prompt
orders
for
the
pursuit
while
a
portion
of
the
confederate
army
followed
closely
upon
the
enemy
rear
other
bodies
were
directed
to
move
by
the
williamsburg
and
charles
city
roads
and
intercept
him
or
assail
his
flanks
if
these
movements
were
promptly
made
and
no
unnecessary
delay
took
place
it
was
expected
that
the
federal
army
would
be
brought
to
bay
in
the
swamp
and
a
final
victory
be
achieved
by
the
confederates
these
complicated
movements
were
soon
in
full
progress
and
at
various
points
on
the
line
of
retreat
fierce
fighting
ensued
general
magruder
advancing
to
savage
station
an
important
depot
of
federal
stores
on
the
york
river
railroad
encountered
on
the
the
powerful
federal
which
fought
obstinately
until
night
when
it
retired
next
day
generals
longstreet
and
hill
had
pushed
down
the
long
bridge
road
and
on
the
next
day
june
came
on
the
retreating
column
which
was
vigorously
engaged
from
the
character
of
the
ground
little
however
was
effected
the
enemy
fought
with
obstinate
courage
and
repulsed
every
assault
the
battle
raged
until
after
nightfall
when
the
federal
army
continued
to
retreat
these
actions
were
the
most
important
and
in
both
the
confederates
had
failed
to
effect
any
important
results
even
jackson
who
had
been
delayed
by
the
destruction
of
the
chickahominy
bridges
in
crossing
to
the
south
bank
from
the
vicinity
of
cold
harbor
and
had
followed
in
rear
of
the
rest
of
the
army
found
himself
checked
by
general
mcclellan
admirable
disposition
for
the
protection
of
his
rear
jackson
made
every
effort
to
strike
a
decisive
blow
at
the
federal
rear
in
the
swamp
but
he
found
a
bridge
in
his
front
destroyed
the
enemy
holding
the
opposite
side
in
strong
force
and
when
he
endeavored
to
force
a
passage
the
determined
fire
from
their
artillery
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
do
so
general
mcclellan
had
thus
foiled
the
generalship
of
lee
and
the
hard
fighting
of
stonewall
jackson
his
excellent
military
judgement
had
defeated
every
attempt
made
to
crush
him
on
the
of
july
he
had
successfully
passed
the
terrible
swamp
in
spite
of
all
his
enemies
and
his
army
was
drawn
up
on
the
wellnigh
impregnable
heights
of
malvern
hill
a
last
struggle
took
place
at
malvern
hill
and
the
confederate
assault
failed
at
all
points
owing
to
the
wooded
nature
of
the
ground
and
the
absence
of
accurate
information
in
regard
to
it
the
attack
was
made
under
very
great
difficulties
and
effected
nothing
the
federal
troops
resisted
courageously
and
inflicted
heavy
loss
upon
the
assailing
force
which
advanced
to
the
muzzles
of
the
federal
cannon
but
did
not
carry
the
heights
and
at
nightfall
the
battle
ceased
the
confederates
having
suffered
a
severe
repulse
on
the
next
morning
general
mcclellan
had
disappeared
toward
harrison
landing
to
which
he
conducted
his
army
safely
without
further
molestation
and
the
long
and
bitter
struggle
was
over
richmond
in
danger
lee
views
we
have
presented
a
sufficiently
full
narrative
of
the
great
battles
of
the
chickahominy
to
enable
the
reader
to
form
his
own
opinion
of
the
events
and
the
capacity
of
the
two
leaders
who
directed
them
full
justice
has
been
sought
to
be
done
to
the
eminent
military
abilities
of
general
mcclellan
and
the
writer
is
not
conscious
that
he
has
done
more
than
justice
to
general
lee
lee
has
not
escaped
criticism
and
was
blamed
by
many
persons
for
not
putting
an
end
to
the
federal
army
on
the
retreat
through
swamp
to
this
criticism
it
may
be
said
in
reply
that
putting
an
end
to
nearly
or
quite
one
hundred
thousand
men
is
a
difficult
undertaking
and
that
in
one
instance
at
least
the
failure
of
one
of
his
subordinates
in
arriving
promptly
reversed
his
plans
at
the
most
critical
moment
of
the
struggle
general
lee
himself
however
states
the
main
cause
of
failure
under
ordinary
circumstances
he
says
the
federal
army
should
have
been
destroyed
its
escape
is
due
to
the
causes
already
stated
prominent
among
them
is
the
want
of
timely
and
correct
information
this
fact
attributed
chiefly
to
the
character
of
the
country
enabled
general
mcclellan
skilfully
to
conceal
his
retreat
and
to
add
much
to
the
obstruction
with
which
nature
had
beset
the
way
of
our
pursuing
columns
but
regret
that
more
was
not
accomplished
gives
way
to
gratitude
to
the
sovereign
ruler
of
the
universe
for
the
results
achieved
the
reader
will
form
his
own
opinion
whether
lee
was
or
was
not
to
blame
for
this
want
of
accurate
information
which
would
seem
however
to
be
justly
attributable
to
the
war
department
at
richmond
rather
than
to
an
officer
who
had
been
assigned
to
command
only
three
or
four
weeks
before
other
criticisms
of
lee
referred
to
his
main
plan
of
operations
and
the
danger
to
which
he
exposed
richmond
by
leaving
only
thousand
men
in
front
of
it
when
he
began
his
movement
against
general
mcclellan
right
wing
beyond
the
chickahominy
general
magruder
who
commanded
this
force
of
thousand
men
left
to
guard
the
capital
expressed
afterward
in
his
official
report
his
views
of
the
danger
to
which
the
city
had
been
exposed
he
wrote
from
the
time
at
which
the
enemy
withdrew
his
forces
to
this
side
of
the
chickahominy
and
destroyed
the
bridges
to
the
moment
of
his
evacuation
that
is
from
friday
night
until
saturday
morning
i
considered
the
situation
of
our
army
as
extremely
critical
and
perilous
the
larger
portion
of
it
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
chickahominy
the
bridges
had
been
all
destroyed
but
one
was
rebuilt
the
new
bridge
which
was
commanded
fully
by
the
enemy
guns
from
goulding
and
there
were
but
thousand
men
between
his
army
of
one
hundred
thousand
and
richmond
had
mcclellan
massed
his
whole
force
in
column
and
advanced
it
against
any
point
of
our
line
of
battle
as
was
done
at
austerlitz
under
similar
circumstances
by
the
greatest
captain
of
any
age
though
the
head
of
his
column
would
have
suffered
greatly
its
momentum
would
have
insured
him
success
and
the
occupation
of
our
works
about
richmond
and
consequently
the
city
might
have
been
his
reward
his
failure
to
do
so
is
the
best
evidence
that
our
wise
commander
fully
understood
the
character
of
his
opponent
to
this
portion
of
general
magruder
report
general
lee
appended
the
following
remarks
in
forwarding
it
general
magruder
is
under
a
misapprehension
as
to
the
separation
of
troops
operating
on
the
north
side
of
the
chickahominy
from
those
under
himself
and
general
huger
on
the
south
side
he
refers
to
this
subject
on
pages
and
of
his
report
the
troops
on
the
two
sides
of
the
river
were
only
separated
until
we
succeeded
in
occupying
the
position
near
what
is
known
as
new
bridge
which
occurred
before
twelve
on
friday
june
and
before
the
attack
on
the
enemy
at
gaines
mill
from
the
time
we
reached
the
position
referred
to
i
regarded
communication
between
the
two
wings
of
our
army
as
reëstablished
the
bridge
referred
to
and
another
about
of
a
mile
above
were
ordered
to
be
repaired
before
noon
on
friday
and
the
new
bridge
was
sufficiently
rebuilt
to
be
passed
by
artillery
on
friday
night
and
the
one
above
it
was
used
for
the
passage
of
wagons
ambulances
and
troops
early
on
saturday
morning
besides
this
all
other
bridges
above
new
bridge
and
all
the
fords
above
that
point
were
open
to
us
to
this
general
magruder
subsequently
responded
as
follows
new
bridge
was
finished
on
friday
evening
the
instead
of
saturday
of
june
i
wrote
from
memory
in
reference
to
the
time
of
its
being
finished
it
was
reported
to
me
that
the
bridge
of
a
mile
above
was
attempted
to
be
crossed
by
troops
i
think
ransom
brigade
on
saturday
morning
from
the
south
to
the
north
side
but
that
finding
the
bridge
or
the
approach
to
it
difficult
they
came
down
and
crossed
at
new
bridge
on
the
same
morning
my
statement
in
regard
to
these
bridges
was
not
intended
as
a
criticism
on
general
lee
plan
but
to
show
the
position
of
the
troops
with
a
view
to
the
proper
understanding
of
my
report
and
to
prove
that
the
enemy
might
have
reasonably
entertained
a
design
after
concentrating
his
troops
to
march
on
richmond
we
shall
not
detain
the
reader
by
entering
upon
a
full
discussion
of
the
interesting
question
here
raised
general
lee
as
his
observations
on
general
magruder
report
show
did
not
regard
richmond
as
exposed
to
serious
danger
and
was
confident
of
his
ability
to
recross
the
chickahominy
and
go
to
its
succor
in
the
event
of
an
attack
on
the
city
by
general
mcclellan
had
this
prompt
recrossing
of
the
stream
here
even
been
impracticable
it
may
still
be
a
question
whether
general
lee
did
not
in
his
movement
against
the
federal
right
wing
with
the
bulk
of
his
army
follow
the
dictates
of
sound
generalship
in
war
something
must
be
risked
and
occasions
arise
which
render
it
necessary
to
disregard
general
maxims
it
is
one
of
the
first
principles
of
military
science
that
a
commander
should
always
keep
open
his
line
of
retreat
but
the
moment
may
come
when
his
best
policy
is
to
burn
the
bridges
behind
him
of
lee
movement
against
general
mcclellan
right
it
may
be
said
that
it
was
based
on
the
broadest
good
sense
and
the
best
generalship
the
situation
of
affairs
rendered
an
attack
in
some
quarter
essential
to
the
safety
of
the
capital
which
was
about
to
be
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
to
attack
the
left
of
general
mcclellan
promised
small
results
it
had
been
tried
and
had
failed
his
right
alone
remained
it
was
possible
certainly
that
he
would
mass
his
army
and
crushing
magruder
march
into
richmond
but
it
was
not
probable
that
he
would
make
the
attempt
the
federal
commander
was
known
to
be
a
soldier
disposed
to
caution
rather
than
audacity
the
small
amount
of
force
under
general
magruder
was
a
secret
which
he
could
not
be
expected
to
know
that
general
lee
took
these
facts
into
consideration
as
general
magruder
intimates
may
or
may
not
have
been
the
fact
and
the
whole
discussion
may
be
fairly
summed
up
perhaps
by
saying
that
success
vindicated
the
course
adopted
success
after
all
is
the
test
of
merit
said
the
brave
albert
sydney
johnston
and
talleyrand
compressed
much
sound
reasoning
in
the
pithy
maxim
nothing
succeeds
like
success
on
the
of
july
the
campaign
was
over
and
general
mcclellan
must
have
felt
in
spite
of
his
hopeful
general
orders
to
the
troops
and
dispatches
to
his
government
that
the
great
struggle
for
richmond
had
virtually
ended
a
week
before
he
had
occupied
a
position
within
a
few
miles
of
the
city
with
a
numerous
army
in
the
highest
spirits
and
of
thorough
efficiency
now
he
lay
on
the
banks
of
james
river
thirty
miles
away
from
the
capital
and
his
army
was
worn
out
by
the
tremendous
ordeal
it
had
passed
through
and
completely
discouraged
we
have
not
dwelt
upon
the
horrors
of
the
retreat
and
the
state
of
the
army
which
northern
writers
painted
at
the
time
in
the
gloomiest
colors
for
the
moment
it
was
no
longer
the
splendid
it
had
been
and
was
again
afterward
nothing
could
be
done
with
it
and
general
mcclellan
knew
the
fact
without
fresh
troops
a
renewed
advance
upon
richmond
was
a
mere
dream
no
further
attack
was
made
by
general
lee
who
remained
for
some
days
inactive
in
the
hot
forests
of
charles
city
his
reasons
for
refraining
from
a
new
assault
on
general
mcclellan
are
summed
up
in
one
or
two
sentences
of
his
report
the
federal
commander
he
says
immediately
began
to
fortify
his
position
which
was
one
of
great
natural
strength
flanked
on
each
side
by
a
creek
and
the
approach
to
his
front
commanded
by
the
heavy
guns
of
his
shipping
in
addition
to
those
mounted
in
his
intrenchments
it
was
deemed
inexpedient
to
attack
him
and
in
view
of
the
condition
of
our
troops
who
had
been
marching
and
fighting
almost
incessantly
for
seven
days
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
it
was
determined
to
withdraw
in
order
to
afford
them
the
repose
of
which
they
stood
so
much
in
need
on
the
of
july
general
lee
accordingly
directed
his
march
back
toward
richmond
and
the
troops
went
into
camp
and
rested
vi
lee
and
mcclellan
their
identity
of
opinion
general
lee
had
thus
at
the
outset
of
his
career
as
commander
of
the
confederate
army
saved
the
capital
by
a
blow
at
the
enemy
as
sudden
as
it
was
resistless
the
class
of
persons
who
are
never
satisfied
and
delight
in
under
all
circumstances
declared
that
a
great
general
would
have
crushed
the
enemy
on
their
retreat
these
certainly
were
in
a
minority
the
people
at
large
greeted
lee
as
the
author
of
a
great
deliverance
worked
out
for
them
and
on
his
return
to
richmond
he
was
received
with
every
mark
of
gratitude
and
honor
he
accepted
this
public
ovation
with
the
moderation
and
dignity
which
characterized
his
demeanor
afterward
under
all
circumstances
either
of
victory
or
defeat
it
was
almost
impossible
to
discover
in
his
bearing
at
this
time
as
on
other
great
occasions
any
evidences
whatever
of
elation
success
like
disaster
seemed
to
find
him
calm
collected
and
as
nearly
unimpressible
as
is
possible
for
a
human
being
the
character
of
the
man
led
him
to
look
upon
success
or
failure
with
this
supreme
composure
which
nothing
seemed
able
to
shake
but
in
july
he
probably
understood
that
the
confederate
states
were
still
as
far
as
ever
from
having
achieved
the
objects
of
the
war
general
mcclellan
had
been
defeated
in
battle
but
the
great
resources
of
the
united
states
government
would
enable
it
promptly
to
put
other
and
larger
armies
in
the
field
even
the
defeated
army
was
still
numerous
and
dangerous
for
it
consisted
according
to
report
of
nearly
or
quite
ninety
thousand
men
and
the
wise
brain
of
its
commander
had
devised
a
plan
of
future
operations
which
promised
far
greater
results
than
the
advance
on
richmond
from
the
chickahominy
we
shall
touch
in
passing
on
this
interesting
subject
but
shall
first
ask
the
reader
attention
to
a
communication
addressed
by
general
mcclellan
at
this
time
to
president
lincoln
it
is
one
of
those
papers
which
belong
to
history
and
should
be
placed
upon
record
it
not
only
throws
the
clearest
light
on
the
character
and
views
of
general
lee
great
adversary
but
expresses
with
admirable
lucidity
the
sentiments
of
a
large
portion
of
the
federal
people
at
the
time
the
president
had
invited
a
statement
of
general
views
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
and
on
july
in
the
very
midst
of
the
scenes
of
disaster
at
harrison
landing
mcclellan
wrote
these
statesmanlike
words
this
rebellion
has
assumed
the
character
of
a
war
as
such
it
should
be
regarded
and
it
should
be
conducted
upon
the
highest
principles
know
to
christian
civilization
it
should
not
be
a
war
looking
to
the
subjugation
of
the
people
of
any
state
in
any
event
it
should
not
be
at
all
a
war
upon
population
but
against
armed
forces
and
political
organization
neither
confiscation
of
property
political
executions
territorial
organizations
of
states
nor
forcible
abolition
of
slavery
should
be
contemplated
for
a
moment
in
prosecuting
the
war
all
private
property
and
unarmed
persons
should
be
strictly
protected
subject
only
to
the
necessity
of
military
operations
all
private
property
taken
for
military
use
should
be
paid
or
receipted
for
pillage
and
waste
should
be
treated
as
high
crimes
all
unnecessary
trespass
sternly
prohibited
and
offensive
demeanor
by
the
military
toward
citizens
promptly
rebuked
military
arrests
should
not
be
tolerated
except
in
places
where
active
hostilities
exist
and
oaths
not
required
by
enactments
constitutionally
made
should
be
neither
demanded
nor
received
military
government
should
be
confined
to
the
preservation
of
public
order
and
the
protection
of
political
right
military
power
should
not
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
relations
of
servitude
either
by
supporting
or
impairing
the
authority
of
the
master
except
for
repressing
disorder
as
in
other
cases
slaves
contraband
under
the
act
of
congress
seeking
military
protection
should
receive
it
the
right
of
the
government
to
appropriate
permanently
to
its
own
service
claims
to
should
be
asserted
and
the
right
of
the
owner
to
compensation
therefor
should
be
recognized
this
principle
might
be
extended
upon
grounds
of
military
necessity
and
security
to
all
the
slaves
of
a
particular
state
thus
working
manumission
in
such
state
and
in
missouri
perhaps
in
western
virginia
also
and
possibly
even
in
maryland
the
expediency
of
such
a
measure
is
only
a
question
of
time
a
system
of
policy
thus
constitutional
and
pervaded
by
the
influences
of
christianity
and
freedom
would
receive
the
support
of
almost
all
truly
loyal
men
would
deeply
impress
the
rebel
masses
and
all
foreign
nations
and
it
might
be
humbly
hoped
that
it
would
commend
itself
to
the
favor
of
the
almighty
unless
the
principles
governing
the
future
conduct
of
our
struggle
shall
be
made
known
and
approved
the
effort
to
obtain
requisite
forces
will
be
almost
hopeless
a
declaration
of
radical
views
especially
upon
slavery
will
rapidly
disintegrate
our
present
armies
the
policy
of
the
government
must
be
supported
by
concentrations
of
military
power
the
national
forces
should
not
be
dispersed
in
expeditions
posts
of
occupation
and
numerous
armies
but
should
be
mainly
collected
into
masses
and
brought
to
bear
upon
the
armies
of
the
confederate
states
those
armies
thoroughly
defeated
the
political
structure
which
they
support
would
soon
cease
to
exist
in
carrying
out
any
system
of
policy
which
you
may
form
you
will
require
a
of
the
army
one
who
possesses
your
confidence
understands
your
views
and
who
is
competent
to
execute
your
orders
by
directing
the
military
forces
of
the
nation
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
objects
by
you
proposed
i
do
not
ask
that
place
for
myself
i
am
willing
to
serve
you
in
such
positions
as
you
may
assign
me
and
i
will
do
so
as
faithfully
as
ever
subordinate
served
superior
i
may
be
on
the
brink
of
eternity
and
as
i
hope
forgiveness
from
my
maker
i
have
written
this
letter
with
sincerity
toward
you
and
from
love
for
my
country
this
noble
and
earnest
exposition
of
his
opinion
upon
the
proper
mode
of
conducting
the
war
will
reflect
honor
upon
general
mcclellan
when
his
military
achievements
are
forgotten
it
discusses
the
situation
of
affairs
both
from
the
political
and
military
point
of
view
in
a
spirit
of
the
broadest
statesmanship
and
with
the
acumen
of
a
great
soldier
that
it
had
no
effect
is
the
clearest
indication
upon
which
the
war
was
thenceforward
to
be
conducted
the
removal
of
general
mcclellan
as
holding
views
opposed
to
the
party
in
power
is
said
to
have
resulted
from
this
communication
it
certainly
placed
him
in
open
antagonism
to
general
halleck
the
federal
secretary
of
war
and
as
this
antagonism
had
a
direct
effect
upon
even
connected
with
the
subject
of
our
memoir
we
shall
briefly
relate
now
it
was
now
displayed
defeated
on
the
chickahominy
and
seeing
little
to
encourage
an
advance
on
the
left
bank
of
the
james
upon
richmond
general
mcclellan
proposed
to
cross
that
river
and
operate
against
the
capital
and
its
communications
near
petersburg
the
proof
of
desire
to
undertake
this
movement
which
afterward
proved
so
successful
under
general
grant
is
found
in
a
memorandum
by
general
halleck
himself
of
what
took
place
on
a
visit
paid
by
him
to
mcclellan
at
harrison
landing
on
july
i
stated
to
him
says
general
halleck
that
the
object
of
my
visit
was
to
ascertain
from
him
his
views
and
wishes
in
regard
to
future
operations
he
said
that
he
proposed
to
cross
the
james
river
at
that
point
attack
petersburg
and
cut
off
the
enemy
communications
by
that
route
south
making
no
further
demonstration
for
the
present
against
richmond
i
stated
to
him
very
frankly
my
views
in
regard
to
the
manner
and
impracticability
of
the
plan
and
nothing
further
it
seems
was
said
of
this
highly
impracticable
plan
of
operations
it
became
practicable
afterward
under
general
grant
mcclellan
was
not
permitted
to
essay
it
in
july
from
the
fact
that
it
had
been
resolved
to
relieve
him
from
command
or
from
general
inability
to
perceive
its
good
sense
general
lee
views
upon
this
subject
coincided
completely
with
those
of
general
mcclellan
he
expressed
at
this
time
to
those
in
his
confidence
the
opinion
that
richmond
could
be
assailed
to
greater
advantage
from
the
south
as
a
movement
of
the
enemy
in
that
direction
would
menace
her
communications
with
the
gulf
states
and
events
subsequently
proved
the
soundness
of
this
view
attacks
from
all
other
quarters
failed
including
a
repetition
by
general
grant
of
mcclellan
attempt
from
the
side
of
the
chickahominy
when
general
grant
carried
out
his
predecessor
plan
of
assailing
the
city
from
the
direction
of
petersburg
he
succeeded
in
putting
an
end
to
the
war
part
iv
war
advances
lee
protest
general
lee
remained
in
front
of
richmond
watching
general
mcclellan
but
intelligence
soon
reached
him
from
the
upper
rappahannock
that
another
army
was
advancing
in
that
quarter
and
had
already
occupied
the
county
of
culpepper
with
the
obvious
intention
of
capturing
gordonsville
the
point
of
junction
of
the
orange
and
alexandria
and
virginia
central
railroads
and
advancing
thence
upon
richmond
the
great
defeat
on
the
chickahominy
had
only
inspired
the
federal
authorities
with
new
energy
three
hundred
thousand
new
troops
were
called
for
large
bounties
were
held
out
as
an
inducement
to
enlistment
in
regions
occupied
by
the
united
states
armies
were
directed
to
be
enrolled
as
troops
and
military
commanders
were
authorized
to
seize
upon
whatever
was
necessary
or
convenient
for
their
commands
without
compensation
to
the
owners
this
indicated
the
policy
upon
which
it
was
now
intended
to
conduct
the
war
and
the
army
occupying
culpepper
proceeded
to
carry
out
the
new
policy
in
every
particular
this
force
consisted
of
the
troops
which
had
served
under
generals
banks
mcdowell
and
fremont
a
necleus
and
reënforcements
from
the
army
of
mcclellan
together
with
the
troops
under
general
burnside
were
hastening
to
unite
with
the
army
it
was
styled
the
army
of
virginia
and
was
placed
under
command
of
john
pope
who
had
hitherto
served
in
the
west
general
pope
had
procured
the
command
it
is
said
by
impressing
the
authorities
with
a
high
opinion
of
his
energy
and
activity
in
these
qualities
general
mcclellan
was
supposed
to
be
deficient
and
the
new
commander
coming
from
a
region
where
the
war
was
conducted
on
a
different
plan
it
was
said
would
be
able
to
infuse
new
life
into
the
languid
movements
in
virginia
general
pope
had
taken
special
pains
to
allay
the
fears
of
the
federal
authorities
for
the
safety
of
washington
he
intended
to
lie
off
on
the
flanks
of
lee
army
he
said
and
render
it
impossible
for
the
rebels
to
advance
upon
the
capital
while
he
occupied
that
threatening
position
when
asked
if
with
an
army
like
general
mcclellan
he
would
find
any
difficulty
in
marching
through
the
south
to
new
orleans
general
pope
replied
without
hesitation
i
should
suppose
not
this
confident
view
of
things
seems
to
have
procured
general
pope
his
appointment
and
it
will
soon
be
seen
that
he
proceeded
to
conduct
military
operations
upon
principles
very
different
from
those
announced
by
general
mcclellan
war
as
carried
on
by
general
pope
was
to
be
war
general
mcclellan
had
written
the
war
should
not
be
at
all
a
war
upon
population
but
against
armed
forces
all
private
property
taken
for
military
use
should
be
paid
for
pillage
and
waste
should
be
treated
as
high
crimes
all
unnecessary
trespass
sternly
prohibited
and
offensive
demeanor
by
the
military
toward
citizens
promptly
rebuked
the
new
commander
intended
to
act
upon
a
very
different
principle
and
to
show
that
he
possessed
more
activity
and
resolution
than
his
predecessor
general
pope
assumption
of
the
command
was
signalized
by
much
pomp
and
animated
general
orders
he
arrived
in
a
train
decked
out
with
streamers
and
issued
an
order
in
which
he
said
to
the
troops
i
desire
you
to
dismiss
from
your
minds
certain
phrases
which
i
am
sorry
to
find
much
in
vogue
among
you
i
hear
constantly
of
taking
strong
positions
and
holding
them
lines
of
retreat
and
bases
of
let
us
discard
such
ideas
the
strongest
position
which
a
soldier
should
desire
to
occupy
is
the
one
from
which
he
can
most
easily
advance
upon
the
enemy
let
us
study
the
probable
line
of
retreat
of
our
opponents
leave
our
own
to
take
care
of
itself
let
us
look
before
and
not
behind
disaster
and
shame
look
in
the
the
result
as
will
be
seen
furnished
a
grotesque
commentary
upon
that
portion
of
general
pope
order
which
we
have
italicized
in
an
address
to
the
army
he
added
further
i
have
come
to
you
from
the
west
where
we
have
always
seen
the
backs
of
our
enemies
from
an
army
whose
business
it
has
been
to
seek
the
adversary
and
beat
him
when
found
where
policy
has
been
attack
and
not
defence
i
presume
i
have
been
called
here
to
pursue
the
same
system
such
was
the
tenor
of
general
pope
orders
on
assuming
command
orders
which
were
either
intended
seriously
as
an
announcement
of
his
real
intentions
or
as
a
blind
to
persuade
the
confederates
that
his
force
was
large
unfortunately
for
the
region
in
which
he
now
came
to
operate
general
pope
did
not
confine
himself
to
these
flourishes
of
rhetoric
he
proceeded
to
inaugurate
a
military
policy
in
vivid
contrast
to
general
mcclellan
his
expatriation
orders
directed
that
all
male
citizens
disloyal
to
the
united
states
should
be
immediately
arrested
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
united
states
government
should
be
proffered
them
and
if
they
furnished
sufficient
security
for
its
observance
they
should
be
set
free
again
if
they
refused
the
oath
they
should
be
sent
beyond
the
federal
lines
and
if
afterward
found
within
his
lines
they
should
be
treated
as
spies
and
shot
their
property
to
be
seized
and
applied
to
the
public
use
all
communication
with
persons
living
within
the
southern
lines
was
forbidden
such
communication
should
subject
the
individual
guilty
of
it
to
be
treated
as
lastly
general
pope
subordinates
were
directed
to
arrest
prominent
citizens
and
hold
them
as
hostages
for
the
good
behavior
of
the
population
if
his
soldiers
were
bushwhacked
that
is
to
say
attacked
on
their
foraging
expeditions
the
prominent
citizens
thus
held
as
hostages
were
to
it
is
obvious
that
war
carried
on
upon
such
principles
is
rapine
general
pope
ventured
however
upon
the
new
programme
and
a
foreign
periodical
commenting
upon
the
result
declared
that
this
commander
had
prosecuted
hostilities
against
the
south
in
a
way
that
cast
mankind
two
centuries
back
toward
barbarism
we
shall
not
pause
to
view
the
great
outrages
committed
by
the
federal
troops
in
culpepper
they
have
received
thus
much
comment
rather
to
introduce
the
following
communication
to
the
federal
authorities
from
general
lee
than
to
record
what
is
known
now
to
the
old
world
as
well
as
the
new
profoundly
outraged
and
indignant
at
these
cruel
and
oppressive
acts
general
lee
by
direction
of
the
confederate
authorities
addressed
on
the
of
august
the
following
note
to
general
halleck
headquarters
army
of
the
near
richmond
the
general
commanding
the
army
general
in
obedience
to
the
order
of
his
excellency
the
president
of
the
confederate
states
i
have
the
honor
to
make
you
the
following
communication
on
the
of
july
last
a
cartel
for
a
general
exchange
of
prisoners
was
signed
by
john
dix
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
by
hill
on
the
part
of
this
government
by
the
terms
of
that
cartel
it
is
stipulated
that
all
prisoners
of
war
hereafter
taken
shall
be
discharged
on
parole
until
exchanged
scarcely
had
the
cartel
been
signed
when
the
military
authorities
of
the
united
states
commenced
a
practice
changing
the
character
of
the
war
from
such
as
becomes
civilized
nations
into
a
campaign
of
indiscriminate
robbery
and
murder
a
general
order
issued
by
the
secretary
of
war
of
the
united
states
in
the
city
of
washington
on
the
very
day
that
the
cartel
was
signed
in
virginia
directs
the
military
commanders
of
the
united
states
to
take
the
property
of
our
people
for
the
convenience
and
use
of
the
army
without
compensation
a
general
order
issued
by
pope
on
the
of
july
last
the
day
after
the
date
of
the
cartel
directs
the
murder
of
our
peaceful
citizens
as
spies
if
found
quietly
tilling
their
farms
in
his
rear
even
outside
of
his
lines
and
one
of
his
steinwehr
has
seized
innocent
and
peaceful
inhabitants
to
be
held
as
hostages
to
the
end
that
they
may
be
murdered
in
cold
blood
if
any
of
his
soldiers
are
killed
by
some
unknown
persons
whom
he
designates
as
bushwhackers
some
of
the
military
authorities
seem
to
suppose
that
their
end
will
be
better
attained
by
a
savage
war
in
which
no
quarter
is
to
be
given
and
no
age
or
sex
is
to
be
spared
than
by
such
hostilities
as
are
alone
recognized
to
be
lawful
in
modern
times
we
find
ourselves
driven
by
our
enemies
by
steady
progress
toward
a
practice
which
we
abhor
and
which
we
are
vainly
struggling
to
avoid
under
these
circumstances
this
government
has
issued
the
accompanying
general
order
which
i
am
directed
by
the
president
to
transmit
to
you
recognizing
pope
and
his
commissioned
officers
to
be
in
the
position
which
they
have
chosen
for
themselves
that
of
robbers
and
murderers
and
not
that
of
public
enemies
entitled
if
captured
to
be
treated
as
prisoners
of
war
the
president
also
instructs
me
to
inform
you
that
we
renounce
our
right
of
retaliation
on
the
innocent
and
will
continue
to
treat
the
private
soldiers
of
general
pope
army
as
prisoners
of
war
but
if
after
notice
to
your
government
that
they
confine
repressive
measures
to
the
punishment
of
commissioned
officers
who
are
willing
to
participate
in
these
crimes
the
savage
practices
threatened
in
the
orders
alluded
to
be
persisted
in
we
shall
reluctantly
be
forced
to
the
last
resort
of
accepting
the
war
on
the
terms
chosen
by
our
enemies
until
the
voice
of
an
outraged
humanity
shall
compel
a
respect
for
the
recognized
usages
of
war
while
the
president
considers
that
the
facts
referred
to
would
justify
a
refusal
on
our
part
to
execute
the
cartel
by
which
we
have
agreed
to
liberate
an
excess
of
prisoners
of
war
in
our
hands
a
sacred
regard
for
plighted
faith
which
shrinks
from
the
semblance
of
breaking
a
promise
precludes
a
resort
to
such
an
extremity
nor
is
it
his
desire
to
extend
to
any
other
forces
of
the
united
states
the
punishment
merited
by
general
pope
and
such
commissioned
officers
as
choose
to
participate
in
the
execution
of
his
infamous
order
i
have
the
honor
to
be
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
lee
this
communication
requires
no
comment
it
had
the
desired
effect
although
general
halleck
returned
it
as
couched
in
language
too
insulting
to
be
received
on
the
of
august
the
united
states
war
department
so
far
disapproved
of
general
pope
orders
as
to
direct
that
no
officer
or
soldier
might
without
proper
authority
leave
his
colors
or
ranks
to
take
private
property
or
to
enter
a
private
house
for
the
purpose
under
penalty
of
death
ii
lee
manoeuvres
general
pope
had
promptly
advanced
and
his
army
lay
in
culpepper
the
right
reaching
toward
the
blue
ridge
and
the
left
extending
nearly
to
the
rapidan
the
campaign
now
became
a
contest
of
brains
between
lee
and
the
federal
authorities
their
obvious
aim
was
to
leave
him
in
doubt
whether
a
new
advance
was
intended
under
mcclellan
from
james
river
or
the
real
movement
was
to
be
against
richmond
from
the
north
under
these
circumstances
general
lee
remained
with
the
bulk
of
his
army
in
front
of
richmond
but
on
the
of
july
sent
jackson
with
two
divisions
in
the
direction
of
gordonsville
the
game
of
wits
had
thus
begun
and
general
lee
moved
cautiously
looking
in
both
directions
toward
james
river
and
the
upper
rappahannock
as
yet
the
real
design
of
the
enemy
was
undeveloped
the
movement
of
general
pope
might
or
might
not
be
a
real
advance
but
general
mcclellan
remained
inactive
and
on
the
of
july
hill
division
was
sent
up
to
reënforce
jackson
while
at
the
same
time
general
hill
commanding
a
force
on
the
south
bank
of
the
james
river
was
directed
to
make
demonstrations
against
mcclellan
communications
by
opening
fire
on
his
transports
the
moment
approached
now
when
the
game
between
the
two
adversaries
was
to
be
decided
on
the
of
august
jackson
assumed
the
offensive
by
attacking
the
enemy
at
orange
and
on
the
general
mcclellan
made
a
prompt
demonstration
to
prevent
lee
from
sending
him
further
reinforcements
a
large
federal
force
advanced
to
malvern
hill
and
was
drawn
up
there
in
line
of
battle
with
every
indication
on
the
part
of
general
mcclellan
of
an
intention
to
advance
anew
upon
richmond
lee
promptly
went
to
meet
him
and
a
slight
engagement
ensued
on
curl
neck
but
on
the
next
morning
the
federal
army
had
disappeared
and
the
whole
movement
was
seen
to
have
been
a
feint
this
state
of
indecision
continued
until
nearly
the
middle
of
august
an
incident
then
occurred
which
clearly
indicated
the
intentions
general
burnside
was
known
to
have
reached
hampton
roads
from
the
southern
coast
with
a
considerable
force
and
the
direction
which
his
flotilla
now
took
would
show
the
design
of
the
federal
authorities
if
a
new
advance
was
intended
from
the
james
the
flotilla
would
ascend
that
river
if
general
pope
army
was
looked
to
for
the
real
movement
general
burnside
would
go
in
that
direction
the
secret
was
discovered
by
the
afterward
celebrated
colonel
john
mosby
then
a
private
and
just
returned
by
way
of
fortress
monroe
from
prison
in
washington
he
ascertained
when
he
disembarked
that
burnside
flotilla
was
about
to
move
toward
the
rappahannock
and
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
information
hastened
to
communicate
it
to
general
lee
he
was
admitted
at
the
headquarters
of
the
latter
near
richmond
to
a
private
interview
and
when
general
lee
had
finished
his
conversation
with
the
individual
then
almost
unknown
he
was
in
possession
of
the
information
necessary
to
determine
his
plans
the
rappahannock
and
not
the
james
was
seen
to
be
the
theatre
of
the
coming
campaign
and
general
lee
whole
attention
was
now
directed
to
that
quarter
jackson
had
already
struck
an
important
blow
there
coöperating
vigorously
as
was
habitual
with
him
in
the
general
plan
of
action
general
mcclellan
had
endeavored
by
a
feint
to
hold
lee
at
richmond
by
a
battle
now
jackson
hastened
the
retreat
of
the
army
under
mcclellan
from
james
river
with
his
three
divisions
jackson
crossed
the
rapidan
and
on
the
of
august
attacked
the
advance
force
of
general
pope
at
cedar
mountain
the
struggle
was
obstinate
and
at
one
time
jackson
left
was
driven
back
but
the
action
terminated
at
nightfall
in
the
retreat
of
the
federal
forces
and
the
confederate
commander
remained
in
possession
of
the
field
he
was
too
weak
however
to
hold
his
position
against
the
main
body
of
the
federal
army
which
was
known
to
be
approaching
he
accordingly
recrossed
the
rapidan
to
the
vicinity
of
gordonsville
and
here
he
was
soon
afterward
joined
by
general
lee
with
the
great
bulk
of
the
confederate
army
such
were
the
events
which
succeeded
the
battles
of
the
chickahominy
transferring
hostilities
to
a
new
theatre
and
inaugurating
the
great
campaigns
of
the
summer
and
autumn
of
in
northern
virginia
and
maryland
iii
lee
advances
from
the
rapidan
general
lee
it
will
thus
be
seen
had
proceeded
in
his
military
manoeuvres
with
the
utmost
caution
determined
to
give
his
adversaries
no
advantage
and
remain
in
front
of
the
capital
until
it
was
free
from
all
danger
but
for
the
daring
assault
upon
general
mcclellan
on
the
chickahominy
his
critics
would
no
doubt
have
charged
him
with
weakness
and
indecision
now
but
under
any
circumstances
it
is
certain
that
he
would
have
proceeded
in
the
same
manner
conducting
operations
in
the
method
which
his
judgment
approved
at
length
the
necessity
of
caution
had
disappeared
general
burnside
had
gone
to
reënforce
general
pope
and
a
portion
of
mcclellan
army
was
believed
to
have
followed
it
therefore
seemed
says
general
lee
that
active
operations
on
the
james
were
no
longer
contemplated
and
he
wisely
concluded
that
the
most
effectual
way
to
relieve
richmond
from
any
danger
of
attack
from
that
quarter
would
be
to
reënforce
general
jackson
and
advance
upon
general
pope
in
commenting
upon
these
words
an
able
writer
of
the
north
exclaims
veracious
prophecy
showing
that
which
is
one
of
the
highest
marks
of
generalship
the
movement
indeed
was
the
right
proceeding
as
the
event
showed
and
good
generalship
may
be
defined
to
be
the
power
of
seeing
what
is
the
proper
course
and
the
decision
of
character
which
leads
to
its
adoption
general
lee
exhibited
throughout
his
career
this
mingled
good
judgment
and
daring
and
his
cautious
inactivity
was
now
succeeded
by
one
of
those
offensive
movements
which
if
we
may
judge
him
by
his
subsequent
career
seemed
to
be
the
natural
bent
of
his
character
with
the
bulk
of
his
army
he
marched
in
the
direction
of
general
pope
the
rest
were
speedily
ordered
to
follow
and
active
operations
began
for
driving
the
federal

i
wish
to
know
during
the
day
how
you
proceed
in
your
preparations
they
will
require
the
personal
attention
of
all
your
officers
the
last
reports
from
the
yesterday
evening
were
that
the
enemy
was
breaking
up
his
principal
encampments
and
moving
in
direction
of
culpepper
very
respectfully
lee
these
orders
indicate
general
lee
design
to
reach
the
left
flank
of
the
enemy
prevent
his
retreat
by
destroying
the
bridges
on
the
rappahannock
and
bring
him
to
battle
in
the
neighborhood
of
culpepper
the
plan
failed
in
consequence
of
a
delay
of
two
days
which
took
place
in
its
execution
a
delay
attributed
at
that
time
we
know
not
with
what
justice
to
the
unnecessarily
deliberate
movements
of
the
corps
commanded
by
general
longstreet
this
delay
enabled
the
enemy
to
gain
information
of
the
intended
movement
and
when
general
lee
advanced
on
the
of
august
instead
of
on
the
as
he
had
at
first
determined
to
do
it
was
found
that
general
pope
had
broken
up
his
camps
and
was
in
rapid
retreat
lee
followed
and
reached
the
rappahannock
only
to
find
that
the
federal
army
had
passed
that
stream
general
pope
who
had
promised
to
conduct
none
but
offensive
operations
and
never
look
to
the
rear
had
thus
hastened
to
interpose
the
waters
of
the
rappahannock
between
himself
and
his
adversary
and
when
general
lee
approached
he
found
every
crossing
of
the
river
heavily
defended
by
the
federal
infantry
and
artillery
in
face
of
this
large
force
occupying
a
commanding
position
on
the
heights
general
lee
made
no
effort
to
cross
he
determined
he
says
not
to
attempt
the
passage
of
the
river
at
that
point
with
the
army
but
to
seek
a
more
favorable
place
to
cross
higher
up
the
river
and
thus
gain
the
enemy
right
this
manoeuvre
was
intrusted
to
jackson
whose
corps
formed
the
confederate
left
wing
jackson
advanced
promptly
to
the
warrenton
springs
ford
which
had
been
selected
as
the
point
of
crossing
drove
away
a
force
of
the
enemy
posted
at
the
place
and
immediately
began
to
pass
the
river
with
his
troops
the
movement
was
however
interrupted
by
a
severe
which
swelled
the
waters
of
the
rappahannock
and
rendered
a
further
prosecution
of
it
impracticable
general
lee
was
thus
compelled
to
give
up
that
plan
and
ordered
jackson
to
withdraw
the
force
which
had
crossed
this
was
done
and
general
lee
was
now
called
upon
to
adopt
some
other
method
of
attack
or
to
remain
inactive
in
face
of
the
enemy
but
to
remain
inactive
was
impossible
the
army
must
either
advance
or
retire
information
which
had
just
reached
the
confederate
general
rendered
one
of
these
two
proceedings
indispensable
the
information
referred
to
had
been
obtained
by
general
stuart
the
activity
and
energy
of
this
officer
especially
in
gaining
intelligence
now
proved
as
they
proved
often
afterward
of
the
utmost
importance
to
lee
stuart
had
been
directed
by
general
lee
to
make
an
attack
with
a
cavalry
force
on
the
orange
and
alexandria
railroad
in
the
rear
he
had
promptly
carried
out
his
orders
by
striking
the
federal
communications
at
catlett
station
had
destroyed
there
all
that
he
found
and
torn
up
the
railroad
but
better
than
all
had
captured
a
box
containing
official
papers
belonging
to
general
pope
these
papers
which
stuart
hastened
marching
day
and
night
through
storm
and
flood
to
convey
to
general
lee
presented
the
clearest
evidence
of
the
enemy
movements
and
designs
troops
were
hastening
from
every
direction
to
reënforce
general
pope
the
entire
force
on
james
river
especially
was
to
be
brought
rapidly
north
of
the
rappahannock
and
any
delay
in
the
operations
of
the
confederates
would
thus
expose
them
to
attack
from
the
federal
forces
concentrated
from
all
quarters

their
front

resolved
upon
a
movement
apparently
of
the
most
reckless
character
this
was
to
separate
his
army
into
two
parts
and
while
one
remained
confronting
the
enemy
on
the
rappahannock
send
the
other
by
a
long
circuit
to
fall
on
the
federal
rear
near
manassas
this
plan
of
action
was
opposed
to
the
first
rule
of
the
military
art
that
a
general
should
never
divide
his
force
in
the
face
of
an
enemy
that
lee
ventured
to
do
so
on
this
occasion
can
only
be
explained
on
one
hypothesis
that
he
did
not
highly
esteem
the
military
ability
of
his
opponent
these
flank
attacks
undoubtedly
however
possessed
a
great
attraction
for
him
as
they
did
for
jackson
and
in
preferring
such
movement
lee
was
probably
actuated
both
by
the
character
of
the
troops
on
both
sides
and
by
the
nature
of
the
country
the
men
of
both
armies
were
comparatively
raw
levies
highly
susceptible
to
the
influence
of
surprise
and
the
appearance
of
an
enemy
on
their
flanks
or
in
their
rear
was
calculated
to
throw
them
into
disorder
the
wooded
character
of
the
theatre
of
war
generally
rendered
such
movements
practicable
and
all
that
was
requisite
was
a
certain
amount
of
daring
in
the
commander
who
was
called
upon
to
decide
upon
them
this
daring
lee
repeatedly
exhibited
and
the
uniform
success
of
the
movements
indicates
his
sound
generalship
to
command
the
force
which
was
now
to
go
on
the
perilous
errand
of
striking
general
pope
rear
general
lee
selected
jackson
who
had
exhibited
such
promptness
and
decision
in
the
campaigns
of
the
valley
of
virginia
rapidity
of
movement
was
necessary
above
all
things
and
if
any
one
could
be
relied
upon
for
that
it
was
the
now
famous
stonewall
jackson
to
him
the
operation
was
accordingly
intrusted
and
his
corps
was
at
once
put
in
motion
crossing
the
rappahannock
at
an
almost
forgotten
ford
high
up
and
out
of
view
of
the
federal
right
jackson
pushed
forward
day
and
night
toward
manassas
reached
thoroughfare
gap
in
the
bull
run
mountain
west
of
that
place
passed
through
and
completely
destroyed
the
great
mass
of
supplies
in
the
federal
depot
at
manassas
the
whole
movement
had
been
made
with
such
rapidity
and
general
stuart
commanding
the
cavalry
had
so
thoroughly
guarded
the
flank
of
the
advancing
column
from
observation
that
manassas
was
a
mass
of
smoking
ruins
almost
before
general
pope
was
aware
of
the
real
danger
intelligence
soon
reached
him
however
of
the
magnitude
of
the
blow
aimed
by
lee
and
hastily
breaking
up
his
camps
on
the
rappahannock
he
hurried
to
attack
the
force
assailing
his
communications
the
first
part
of
general
lee
plan
had
thus
fully
succeeded
general
pope
who
had
occupied
every
ford
of
the
rappahannock
so
as
to
render
the
passage
difficult
if
not
impossible
had
disappeared
suddenly
to
go
and
attack
the
enemy
in
his
rear
general
lee
promptly
moved
in
his
turn
with
the
great
corps
under
longstreet
and
pushed
toward
manassas
over
nearly
the
same
road
followed
by
jackson
illustration
jackson
lee
follows
the
contest
of
generalship
had
now
fully
begun
and
the
brain
of
general
lee
was
matched
against
the
brain
of
general
pope
it
is
no
part
of
the
design
of
the
writer
of
this
volume
to
exalt
unduly
the
reputation
of
lee
and
detract
from
the
credit
due
his
adversaries
justice
has
been
sought
to
be
done
to
general
mcclellan
the
same
measure
of
justice
will
be
dealt
out
to
his
successors
on
the
federal
side
nor
is
it
calculated
to
elevate
the
fame
of
lee
to
show
that
his
opponents
were
incapable
and
inefficient
of
general
pope
however
it
must
be
said
that
he
suffered
himself
to
be
outgeneralled
in
every
particular
and
the
pithy
comment
of
general
lee
that
he
did
not
appear
to
be
aware
of
his
situation
sums
up
the
whole
subject
it
is
beyond
our
purpose
to
enter
upon
any
thing
resembling
a
detailed
narrative
of
the
confused
and
complicated
movements
of
the
various
corps
of
the
army
under
general
pope
these
have
been
the
subject
of
the
severest
criticism
by
his
own
followers
we
shall
simply
notice
the
naked
events
jackson
reached
manassas
on
the
night
of
august
took
it
and
on
the
next
day
destroyed
the
great
depot
general
pope
was
hastening
to
protect
it
but
was
delayed
by
ewell
at
bristoe
and
a
force
sent
up
from
washington
under
the
brave
general
taylor
was
driven
off
with
loss
then
having
achieved
his
aim
jackson
fell
back
toward
sudley
if
the
reader
will
look
at
the
map
he
will
now
understand
the
exact
condition
of
affairs
jackson
had
burned
the
federal
depot
of
supplies
and
retired
before
the
great
force
hastening
to
rescue
them
he
had
with
him
about
twenty
thousand
men
and
general
pope
force
was
probably
triple
that
number
thus
the
point
was
to
hold
general
pope
at
until
the
arrival
of
lee
and
to
accomplish
this
great
end
jackson
fell
back
beyond
groveton
there
he
formed
line
of
battle
and
waited
it
is
obvious
that
under
these
circumstances
the
true
policy
of
general
pope
was
to
obstruct
thoroughfare
gap
the
only
road
by
which
lee
could
approach
promptly
and
then
crush
jackson
on
the
night
of
the
general
mcdowell
was
accordingly
sent
thither
with
forty
thousand
men
but
general
pope
ordered
him
on
the
next
morning
to
manassas
where
he
hoped
to
bag
the
whole
crowd
he
said
that
is
to
say
the
force
under
jackson
this
was
the
fatal
mistake
made
by
general
pope
thoroughfare
gap
was
comparatively
undefended
while
general
pope
was
marching
to
attack
jackson
who
had
disappeared
it
was
the
next
thing
to
a
certainty
that
general
lee
would
attack
all
parties
were
thus
moving
to
and
fro
but
the
confederates
enjoyed
the
very
great
advantage
over
general
pope
of
knowing
precisely
how
affairs
stood
and
of
having
determined
upon
their
own
plan
of
operations
jackson
with
his
back
to
the
mountain
was
waiting
for
lee
lee
was
approaching
rapidly
to
unite
the
two
halves
of
his
army
general
pope
meanwhile
was
marching
and
countermarching
apparently
ignorant
of
the
whereabouts
of
jackson
general
lee
in
personal
command
of
longstreet
corps
reached
the
western
end
of
thoroughfare
gap
about
sunset
on
the
and
the
sound
of
artillery
from
the
direction
of
groveton
indicated
that
jackson
and
general
pope
had
come
in
collision
jackson
had
himself
brought
on
this
engagement
by
attacking
the
flank
of
one
of
general
pope
various
columns
as
it
marched
across
his
front
over
the
warrenton
road
and
this
was
the
origin
of
the
sound
wafted
to
general
lee
ears
as
he
came
in
sight
of
thoroughfare
it
was
certainly
calculated
to
excite
his
nerves
if
they
were
capable
of
being
excited
jackson
was
evidently
engaged
and
the
disproportion
between
his
forces
and
those
of
general
pope
rendered
such
an
engagement
extremely
critical
lee
accordingly
pressed
forward
reached
the
gap
and
the
advance
force
suddenly
halted
the
gap
was
defended
the
federal
force
posted
here
at
the
eastern
opening
of
the
gap
was
small
and
wholly
inadequate
for
the
purpose
but
this
was
as
yet
unknown
to
general
lee
his
anxiety
under
these
circumstances
must
have
been
great
jackson
might
be
crushed
before
his
arrival
he
rode
up
to
the
summit
of
the
commanding
hill
which
rises
just
west
of
the
gap
and
dismounting
directed
his
toward
the
shaggy
defile
in
front
footnote

knowing
at
the
time
where
was
the
enemy

what
course

reconnoitring
at
throughfare
gap
the
writer
of
these
pages
chanced
to
be
near
the
confederate
commander
at
this
moment
and
was
vividly
impressed
by
the
air
of
unmoved
calmness
which
marked
his
countenance
and
demeanor
nothing
in
the
expression
of
his
face
and
no
hurried
movement
indicated
excitement
or
anxiety
here
as
on
many
other
occasions
lee
impressed
the
writer
as
an
individual
gifted
with
the
most
surprising
faculty
of
remaining
cool
and
unaffected
in
the
midst
of
circumstances
calculated
to
arouse
the
most
phlegmatic
after
reconnoitring
for
some
moments
without
moving
he
closed
his
glass
slowly
as
though
he
were
buried
in
reflection
and
deliberating
at
his
leisure
and
walking
back
slowly
to
his
horse
mounted
and
rode
down
the
hill
the
attack
was
not
delayed
and
flanking
columns
were
sent
to
cross
north
of
the
gap
and
assail
the
enemy

but
the
assault
in
front
was
successful
the
small
force
of
the
enemy
at
the
eastern
opening
of
the
gap
retired
and
by
nine
at
night
general
corps
was
passing
through
all
the
next
morning
august
longstreet
troops
were
coming
into
position
on
the
right
of
jackson
under
the
personal
supervision
of
lee
by
noon

general
pope
had
not
been
able
to
crush

than
that
army
for
hours
nearly
in
his
clutches
and
it
did
not
seem
probable
that
he
would
meet
with
greater
success
now
that
the
whole
was
concentrated
and
held
in
the
firm
hand
of
lee
footnote
the
hour
of
longstreet
arrival
has
been
strangely
a
subject
of
discussion
the
truth
is
stated
in
the
reports
of
lee
longstreet
jones
and
other
officers
but
general
pope
was
ignorant
of
longstreet

by

was
in
line
of
battle
by
noon
vi
the
second
battle
of
manassas
lee
order
of
battle
for
the
coming
action
was
peculiar
it
resembled
an
open
v
with
the
opening
toward
the
enemy
jackson
corps
forming
the
left
wing
and
extending
from
near
sudley
to
a
point
in
rear
of
the
small
village
of
groveton
longstreet
corps
forming
the
right
wing
and
reaching
from
jackson
right
to
and
beyond
the
warrenton
road
which
runs
to
stonebridge
the
field
of
battle
was
nearly
identical
with
that
of
july
the
only
difference
was
that
the
confederates
occupied
the
ground
formerly
held
by
the
federal
troops
and
that
the
latter
attacked
as
johnston
and
beauregard
had
attacked
from
the
direction
of
manassas
and
the
tableland
around
the
henry
house
the
southern
order
of
battle
seems
to
have
contemplated
a
movement
on
one
or
both
of
general
pope
flanks
while
he
attacked
in
front
an
assault
on
either
wing
would
expose
him
to
danger
from
the
other
and
it
will
be
seen
that
the
fate
of
the
battle
was
decided
by
this
judicious
arrangement
of
the
confederate
commander
the
action
began
a
little
after
noon
when
the
federal
right
consisting
of
the
troops
of
generals
banks
sigel
and
others
advanced
and
made
a
vigorous
attack
on
jackson
left
under
hill
an
obstinate
conflict
ensued
the
opposing
lines
fighting
almost
bayonet
to
bayonet
delivering
their
volleys
into
each
other
at
the
distance
of
ten
paces
at
the
first
charge
an
interval
between
two
of
hill
brigades
was
penetrated
by
the
enemy
and
that
wing
of
jackson
corps
was
in
great
danger
of
being
driven
back
this
disaster
was
however
prevented
by
the
prompt
stand
made
by
two
or
three
regiments
the
enemy
was
checked
and
a
prompt
drove
the
federal
assaulting
columns
back
into
the
woods
the
attempt
to
break
jackson
line
at
this
point
was
not
however
abandoned
the
federal
troops
returned
again
and
again
to
the
encounter
and
general
hill
reported
six
separate
and
distinct
assaults
made
upon
him
they
were
all
repulsed
in
which
important
assistance
was
rendered
by
general
early
that
brave
officer
attacked
with
vigor
and
aided
by
the
fire
of
the
confederate
artillery
from
the
elevated
ground
in
jackson
rear
drove
the
enemy
before
him
with
such
slaughter
that
one
of
their
regiments
is
said
to
have
carried
back
but
three
men
this
assault
of
the
enemy
had
been
of
so
determined
a
character
that
general
lee
in
order
to
relieve
his
left
had
directed
hood
and
evans
near
his
centre
to
advance
and
attack
the
left
of
the
assaulting
column
hood
was
about
to
do
so
when
he
found
a
heavy
force
advancing
to
charge
his
own
line
a
warm
engagement
followed
which
resulted
in
the
repulse
of
the
enemy
and
hood
followed
them
a
considerable
distance
inflicting
heavy
loss
it
was
now
nearly
nine
at
night
and
the
darkness
rendered
further
operations
impossible
the
troops
which
had
driven
the
enemy
were
recalled
from
their
advanced
position
the
southern
line
was
reformed
on
the
same
ground
occupied
at
the
commencement
of
the
action
and
general
lee
prepared
for
the
more
decisive
struggle
of
the
next
day
morning
came
august
but
all
the
forenoon
passed
without
a
resumption
of
the
battle
each
of
the
adversaries
seemed
to
await
some
movement
on
the
part
of
the
other
and
the
federal
commander
made
heavy
feints
against
both
the
confederate
right
and
left
with
the
view
of
discovering
some
weak
point
or
of
inducing
lee
to
lay
himself
open
to
attack
these
movements
had
however
no
effect
lee
remained
obstinately
in
his
strong
position
rightly
estimating
the
advantage
it
gave
him
and
no
doubt
taking
into
consideration
the
want
of
supplies
general
pope
must
labor
under
a
deficiency
which
rendered
a
prompt
assault
on
his
part
indispensable
the
armies
thus
remained
in
face
of
each
other
without
serious
efforts
upon
either
side
until
nearly
or
quite
the
hour
of
three
in
the
afternoon
general
pope
then
resumed
the
assault
on
lee
left
under
jackson
with
his
best
troops
the
charge
was
furious
and
a
bloody
struggle
ensued
but
jackson
succeeded
in
repulsing
the
force
it
fell
back
in
disorder
but
was
succeeded
by
a
second
and
a
third
line
which
rushed
forward
at
the
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
break
the
southern
line
these
new
attacks
were
met
with
greater
obstinacy
than
at
first
and
just
as
the
opponents
had
closed
in
a
heavy
fire
was
directed
against
the
federal
column
by
colonel
lee
commanding
the
artillery
at
lee
centre
this
fire
which
was
of
the
most
rapid
and
destructive
character
struck
the
enemy
in
front
and
flank
at
once
and
seemed
to
sweep
back
the
charging
brigades
as
they
came
the
fire
of
the
cannon
was
then
redoubled
and
jackson
line
advanced
with
cheers
before
this
charge
the
federal
line
broke
and
jackson
pressed
forward
allowing
them
no
respite
general
lee
then
threw
forward
longstreet
who
knowing
what
was
expected
of
him
was
already
moving
the
enemy
were
pressed
thus
in
front
and
on
their
flank
as
lee
had
no
doubt
intended
in
forming
his
peculiar
line
the
corps
of
jackson
and
longstreet
closed
in
like
two
iron
arms
the
federal
forces
were
driven
from
position
to
position
the
glare
of
their
cannon
more
and
more
distant
indicated
that
they
had
abandoned
further
contest
and
at
ten
at
night
the
darkness
put
an
end
to
the
battle
and
pursuit
general
pope
was
retreating
with
his
defeated
forces
toward
washington
on
the
next
day
lee
dispatched
jackson
to
turn
centreville
and
cut
off
the
retreat
of
general
pope
the
result
was
a
severe
engagement
near
germantown
which
was
put
an
end
to
by
a
violent
storm
general
pope
now
reënforced
by
the
commands
of
generals
sumner
and
franklin
had
been
enabled
to
hold
his
ground
until
night
when
on
the
next
day
september
the
confederates
advanced
to
fairfax
it
was
found
that
the
entire
federal
army
was
in
rapid
retreat
upon
washington
such
had
been
the
fate
of
general
pope
part
invades
i
his
designs
the
defeat
of
general
pope
opened
the
way
for
movements
not
contemplated
probably
by
general
lee
when
he
marched
from
richmond
to
check
the
advance
in
culpepper
his
object
at
that
time
was
doubtless
simply
to
arrest
the
forward
movement
of
the
new
force
threatening
gordonsville
now
however
the
position
of
the
pieces
on
the
great
of
war
had
suddenly
changed
and
it
was
obviously
lee
policy
to
extract
all
the
advantage
possible
from
the
new
condition
of
things
he
accordingly
determined
to
advance
into
maryland
the
fortifications
in
front
of
washington
and
the
interposition
of
the
potomac
a

rendering
a
movement
in
that
direction
unpromising
on
the
of

therefore
and
without
waiting
to
rest
his
army
which
was
greatly
fatigued
with
the
nearly
continuous
marching
and
fighting

it
had
left

occupied
on
the
of

lee
object
in
invading
maryland
has
been
the
subject
of
much
discussion
one
party
holding
the
view
that
his
sole
aim
was
to
surround
and
capture
a
force
of
nine
or
ten
thousand
federal
troops
stationed
at
harper
ferry
and
another
party
maintaining
that
he
proposed
an
invasion
of
pennsylvania
as
far
as
the
susquehanna
intending
to
fight
a
decisive
battle
there
and
advance
thereafter
upon
philadelphia
baltimore
or
washington
the
course
pursued
by
an
army
commander
is
largely
shaped
by
the
progress
of
events
it
can
only
be
said
that
general
lee
doubtless
left
the
future
to
decide
his
ultimate
movements
meanwhile
he
had
a
distinct
and
aim
which
he
states
in
plain
words
his
object
was
to
draw
the
federal
forces
out
of
virginia
first
the
movement
culminating
in
the
victory
over
the
enemy
at
manassas
had
produced
the
effect
of
paralyzing
them
in
every
quarter
on
the
coast
of
north
carolina
in
western
virginia
and
in
the
shenandoah
valley
had
been
heard
the
echo
of
the
great
events
in
middle
and
northern
virginia
general
burnside
force
had
been
brought
up
from
the
south
leaving
affairs
at
a
in
that
direction
and
contemporaneously
with
the
retreat
of
general
pope
the
federal
forces
at
washington
and
beyond
had
fallen
back
to
the
potomac
this
left
the
way
open
and
lee
farther
advance
it
was
obvious
would
now
completely
clear
virginia
of
her
invaders
the
situation
of
affairs
and
the
expected
results
are
clearly
stated
by
general
lee
the
war
was
thus
transferred
he
says
from
the
interior
to
the
frontier
and
the
supplies
of
rich
and
productive
districts
made
accessible
to
our
army
to
prolong
a
state
of
affairs
in
every
way
desirable
and
not
to
permit
the
season
for
active
operations
to
pass
without
endeavoring
to
inflict
other
injury
upon
the
enemy
the
best
course
appeared
to
be
the
transfer
of
the
army
into
maryland
the
state
of
things
in
maryland
was
another
important
consideration
that
great
commonwealth
was
known
to
be
sectionally
divided
in
its
sentiment
toward
the
federal
government
the
eastern
portion
adhering
generally
to
the
side
of
the
south
and
the
western
portion
generally
to
the
federal
side
but
even
as
high
up
as
frederick
it
was
hoped
that
the
southern
cause
would
find
adherents
and
volunteers
to
march
under
the
confederate
banner
if
this
portion
of
the
population
had
only
the
opportunity
to
choose
their
part
unterrified
by
federal
bayonets
it
was
supposed
they
would
decide
for
the
south
in
any
event
the
movement
would
be
important
the
condition
of
affairs
in
maryland
general
lee
says
encouraged
the
belief
that
the
presence
of
our
army
however
inferior
to
that
of
the
enemy
would
induce
the
washington
government
to
retain
all
its
available
force
to
provide
for
contingencies
which
its
course
toward
the
people
of
that
state
gave
it
reason
to
apprehend
and
to
cross
the
potomac
might
afford
us
an
opportunity
to
aid
the
citizens
of
maryland
in
any
efforts
they
might
be
disposed
to
make
to
recover
their
liberty
it
may
be
said
in
summing
up
on
this
point
that
lee
expected
volunteers
to
enroll
themselves
under
his
standard
tempted
to
do
so
by
the
hope
of
throwing
off
the
yoke
of
the
federal
government
and
the
army
certainly
shared
this
expectation
the
identity
of
sentiment
generally
between
the
people
of
the
states
of
maryland
and
virginia
and
their
strong
social
ties
in
the
past
rendered
this
anticipation
reasonable
and
the
feeling
of
the
country
at
the
result
afterward
was
extremely
bitter
such
were
the
first
designs
of
lee
his
ultimate
aim
seems
as
clear
by
advancing
into
maryland
and
threatening
baltimore
and
washington
he
knew
that
he
would
force
the
enemy
to
withdraw
all
their
troops
from
the
south
bank
of
the
potomac
where
they
menaced
the
confederate
communications
with
richmond
when
this
was
accomplished
as
it
clearly
would
be
his
design
was
to
cross
the
maryland
extension
of
the
blue
ridge
called
there
the
south
mountain
advance
by
way
of
hagerstown
into
the
cumberland
valley
and
by
thus
forcing
the
enemy
to
follow
him
draw
them
to
a
distance
from
their
base
of
supplies
while
his
own
communications
would
remain
open
by
way
of
the
shenandoah
valley
this
was
essentially
the
same
plan
pursued
in
the
campaign
of
which
terminated
in
the
battle
of
gettysburg
general
lee
movements
now
indicated
similar
intentions
he
doubtless
wished
in
the
first
place
to
compel
the
enemy
to
pursue
him
then
to
lead
them
as
far
as
was
prudent
and
then
if
circumstances
were
favorable
bring
them
to
decisive
battle
success
in
which
promised
to
open
for
him
the
gates
of
washington
or
baltimore
and
end
the
war
it
will
now
be
seen
how
the
delay
caused
by
the
movement
of
jackson
against
harper
ferry
and
the
discovery
by
general
mcclellan
of
the
entire
arrangement
devised
by
lee
for
that
purpose
caused
the
failure
of
this
whole
ulterior
design

the

purpose
that
has

command
within

as

yourselves
the
people
of

long
watched
with
the
deepest
sympathy

wrongs
and
outrages
that
have
been
inflicted
upon
the
citizens
of
a
commonwealth
allied
to

by
the
strongest
social

and
commercial
ties
they
have
seen
with
profound
indignation
their
sister
state
deprived
of
every
right
and
reduced
to
the
condition
of
a
conquered
province
under
the
pretence
of
supporting
the
constitution
but
in
violation
of
its
most
valuable
provisions
your
citizens
have
been
arrested

imprisoned
upon
no

and
contrary
to
all

the

protest
against
this
outrage
made
by
the
venerable
and
illustrious
marylanders
to
whom
in
better
days
no
citizen
appealed
for
right
in
vain
was
treated
with
scorn
and
contempt
the
government
of
your
chief
city
has
been
usurped
by
armed
strangers
your

has
been
dissolved
by
the
unlawful
arrest
of
its

freedom

ordered

for
what
they
may
dare
to
speak
believing
that
the
people
of
maryland
possessed
a
spirit
too
lofty
to
submit
to
such
a
government
the
people
of
the
south
have
long
wished
to
aid
you
in
throwing
off
this
foreign
yoke
to
enable
you
again
to
enjoy
the
inalienable
rights
of

restore

your
natural
position
among

only
welcome
you

you
come

your

free
will
lee
this
address
full
of
grave
dignity
and
highly
characteristic
of
the
confederate
commander
was
in
vivid
contrast
with
the
harsh
orders
of
general
pope
in
culpepper
the
accents
of
friendship
and
persuasion
were
substituted
for
the
rod
of
iron
there
would
be
no
coercive
measures
no
arrests
with
the
alternative
presented
of
an
oath
to
support
the
south
or
instant
banishment
no
intimidation
would
be
permitted
in
the
lines
of
the
southern
army
at
least
marylanders
should
enjoy
freedom
of
thought
and
speech
and
every
man
should
decide
his
destiny
freely
and
without
constraint
this
address
couched
in
terms
of
such
dignity
had
little
effect
upon
the
people
either
their
sentiment
in
favor
of
the
union
was
too
strong
or
they
found
nothing
in
the
condition
of
affairs
to
encourage
their
southern
feelings
a
large
federal
force
was
known
to
be
advancing
lee
army
in
tatters
and
almost
without
supplies
presented
a
very
uninviting
appearance
to
recruits
and
few
joined
his
standard
the
population
in
general
remaining
hostile
or
neutral
the
condition
of
the
army
was
indeed
forlorn
it
was
worn
down
by
marching
and
fighting
the
men
had
scarcely
shoes
upon
their
feet
and
above
the
tattered
figures
flaunting
their
rags
in
the
sunshine
were
seen
gaunt
and
begrimed
faces
in
which
could
be
read
little
of
the
romance
of
war
the
army
was
in
no
condition
to
undertake
an
invasion
lacking
much
of
the
material
of
war
feeble
in
transportation
poorly
provided
with
clothing
and
thousands
of
them
destitute
of
shoes
is
lee
description
of
his
troops
such
was
the
condition
of
the
better
portion
of
the
force
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
potomac
scattered
along
the
hills
could
be
seen
a
weary
ragged
hungry
and
confused
multitude
who
had
dragged
along
in
rear
of
the
rest
unable
to
keep
up
and
whose
miserable
appearance
said
little
for
the
prospects
of
the
army
to
which
they
belonged
from
these
and
other
causes
resulted
the
general
apathy
of
the
marylanders
and
lee
soon
discovered
that
he
must
look
solely
to
his
own
men
for
success
in
his
future
movements
he
faced
that
conviction
courageously
and
without
uttering
a
word
of
comment
or
indulging
in
any
species
of
crimination
against
the
people
of
maryland
resolutely
commenced
his
movements
looking
to
the
capture
of
harper
ferry
and
the
invasion
of
pennsylvania
footnote
the
reader
will
perceive
that
the
intent
to
pennsylvania
is
repeatedly
attributed
in
these
pages
to
general
lee
his
own
expression
is
by
pennsylvania
to
induce
the
enemy
etc
that
he
designed
invasion
aided
by
the
recruits
anticipated
in
maryland
seems
unquestionable
since
even
after
discovering
the
lukewarmness
of
the
people
there
by
the
fact
that
few
joined
his
standard
he
still
advanced
to
hagerstown
but
a
step
from
the
pennsylvania
line
these
facts
have
induced
the
present
writer
to
attribute
the
design
of
actual
invasion
to
lee
with
entire
confidence
and
all
the
circumstances
seem
to
him
to
support
that
hypothesis
the
promises
of
his
address
had
been
kept
no
one
had
been
forced
to
follow
the
southern
flag
and
now
when
the
people
turned
their
backs
upon
it
closing
the
doors
of
the
houses
in
the
faces
of
the
southern
troops
they
remained
unmolested
lee
had
thus
given
a
practical
proof
of
the
sincerity
of
his
character
he
had
promised
nothing
which
he
had
not
performed
and
in
maryland
as
afterward
in
pennsylvania
in
he
remained
firm
against
the
temptation
to
adopt
the
harsh
course
generally
pursued
by
the
commanders
of
invading
armies
he
seems
to
have
proceeded
on
the
principle
that
good
faith
is
as
essential
in
public
affairs
as
in
private
and
to
have
resolved
that
in
any
event
whether
of
victory
or
disaster
his
enemies
should
not
have
it
in
their
power
to
say
that
he
broke
his
plighted
word
or
acted
in
a
manner
unbecoming
a
christian
gentleman
prompt
action
was
now
necessary
the
remnants
of
general
pope
army
greatly
scattered
and
disorganized
by
the
severe
battle
of
manassas
had
been
rapidly
reformed
and
brought
into
order
again
and
to
this
force
was
added
a
large
number
of
new
troops
hurried
forward
from
the
northern
states
to
washington
this
new
army
was
not
to
be
commanded
by
general
pope
who
had
been
weighed
and
found
wanting
in
ability
to
contend
with
lee
the
force
was
intrusted
to
general
mcclellan
in
spite
of
his
unpopularity
with
the
federal
authorities
and
the
urgent
manner
in
which
he
had
been
called
upon
to
take
the
head
of
affairs
and
protect
the
federal
capital
is
the
most
eloquent
of
all
commentaries
upon
the
position
which
he
held
in
the
eyes
of
the
country
and
the
army
it
was
felt
indeed
by
all
that
the
federal
ship
was
rolling
in
the
storm
and
an
experienced
pilot
was
necessary
for
her
guidance
general
mcclellan
was
accordingly
directed
after
general
pope
defeat
to
take
command
of
every
thing
and
see
to
the
safety
of
washington
and
finding
himself
at
length
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
about
one
hundred
thousand
men
he
proceeded
after
the
manner
of
a
good
soldier
to
protect
the
federal
capital
by
advancing
into
upper
maryland
in
pursuit
of
lee
iii
movements
of
the
two
armies
general
lee
was
already
moving
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
designs
the
capture
of
harper
ferry
and
an
advance
into
the
cumberland
valley
his
plan
to
attain
the
object
was
simple
and
promised
to
be
successful
jackson
was
to
march
around
by
way
of
williamsport
and
martinsburg
and
thus
approach
from
the
south
a
force
was
meanwhile
to
seize
upon
and
occupy
the
maryland
heights
a
lofty
spot
of
the
mountain
across
the
potomac
north
of
the
ferry
in
like
manner
another
body
of
troops
was
to
cross
the
potomac
east
of
the
blue
ridge
and
occupy
the
loudon
heights
looking
down
upon
ferry
from
the
east
by
this
arrangement
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
would
be
completely
cut
off
in
every
direction
harper
ferry
must
be
captured
and
having
effected
that
result
the
whole
confederate
force
detached
for
the
purpose
was
to
follow
the
main
body
of
this
army
in
the
direction
of
hagerstown
to
take
part
in
the
proposed
invasion
of
pennsylvania
this
excellent
plan
failed
as
will
be
seen
from
no
fault
of
the
great
soldier
who
devised
it
but
in
consequence
of
unforeseen
obstacles
and
especially
of
one
of
those
singular
incidents
which
occasionally
reverse
the
schemes
and
abruptly
turn
aside
the
currents
of
history
jackson
and
the
commanders
coöperating
with
him
moved
on
september
general
lee
then
with
his
main
body
crossed
the
south
mountain
taking
the
direction
of
hagerstown
meanwhile
general
mcclellan
had
advanced
cautiously
and
slowly
withheld
by
incessant
dispatches
from
washington
warning
him
not
to
move
in
such
a
manner
as
to
expose
that
city
to
danger
such
danger
existed
only
in
the
imaginations
of
the
authorities
as
the
army
in
advancing
extended
its
front
from
the
potomac
to
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
general
mcclellan
nevertheless
moved
with
very
great
precaution
feeling
his
way
step
by
step
like
a
man
in
the
dark
when
on
reaching
frederick
city
which
the
confederates
had
just
evacuated
good
fortune
suddenly
came
to
his
assistance
this
good
fortune
was
the
discovery
of
a
copy
of
general
lee
orders
of
march
for
the
army
in
which
his
whole
plan
was
revealed
general
mcclellan
had
therein
the
unmistakable
evidence
of
his
opponent
intentions
and
from
that
moment
his
advance
was
as
rapid
as
before
it
had
been
deliberate
the
result
of
this
fortunate
discovery
was
speedily
seen
general
lee
while
moving
steadily
toward
hagerstown
was
suddenly
compelled
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
in
his
rear
it
had
not
been
the
intention
of
lee
to
oppose
the
passage
of
the
enemy
through
the
south
mountain
as
he
desired
to
draw
general
mcclellan
as
far
as
possible
from
his
base
but
the
delay
in
the
fall
of
ferry
now
made
this
necessary
it
was
essential
to
defend
the
in
order
to
insure
the
safety
of
the
confederate
troops
at
harper
ferry
and
lee
accordingly
directed
general
hill
to
oppose
the
passage
of
the
enemy
at
boonsboro
gap
and
longstreet
was
sent
from
hagerstown
to
support
him
an
obstinate
struggle
now
ensued
for
the
possession
of
the
main
south
mountain
gap
near
boonsboro
and
the
roar
of
jackson
artillery
from
harper
ferry
must
have
prompted
the
assailants
to
determined
efforts
to
force
the
passage
the
battle
continued
until
night
september
and
resulted
in
heavy
loss
on
both
sides
the
brave
general
reno
of
the
united
states
army
among
others
losing
his
life
darkness
put
an
end
to
the
action
the
federal
forces
not
having
succeeded
in
passing
the
gap
but
learning
that
a
column
of
the
enemy
had
crossed
below
and
threatened
him
with
an
attack
in
flank
general
lee
determined
to
retire
in
the
direction
of
sharpsburg
where
jackson
and
the
forces
coöperating
with
him
could
join
the
main
body
of
the
army
this
movement
was
effected
without
difficulty
and
lee
notices
the
skill
and
efficiency
of
general
fitz
lee
in
covering
the
rear
with
his
cavalry
the
federal
army
failed
to
press
forward
as
rapidly
as
it
is
now
obvious
it
should
have
done
the
head
of
the
column
did
not
appear
west
of
the
mountain
until
eight
in
the
morning
september
and
nearly
at
the
same
moment
the
attack
began
at
dawn
in
about
two
hours
the
garrison
surrendered
says
general
lee
harper
ferry
yielded
to
jackson
couriers
brought
the
welcome
intelligence
of
success
to
general
lee
as
the
latter
was
approaching
sharpsburg
and
official
information
speedily
came
that
the
result
had
been
the
capture
of
more
than
eleven
thousand
men
thirteen
thousand
and
cannon
it
was
probably
this
large
number
of
men
and
amount
of
military
stores
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
confederates
which
afterward
induced
the
opinion
that
lee
sole
design
in
invading
maryland
had
been
the
reduction
of
harper
ferry
general
mcclellan
had
thus
failed
in
spite
of
every
effort
which
he
had
made
to
relieve
harper
ferry
and
no
other
course
remained
now
but
to
follow
lee
and
bring
him
to
battle
the
federal
army
accordingly
moved
on
the
track
of
its
adversary
and
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
september
found
itself
in
sight
of
forces
drawn
up
on
the
western
side
of
antietam
creek
near
the
village
of
sharpsburg
footnote
all
along
the
march
he
had
fired
to
inform
the
officer
in
command
at
harper
ferry
of
his
approach
at
last
the
great
opponents
were
in
face
of
each
other
and
a
battle
it
was
obvious
could
not
long
be
delayed
iv
the
prelude
to
sharpsburg
general
lee
had
once
more
sustained
a
serious
check
from
the
skill
and
soldiership
of
the
officer
who
had
conducted
the
successful
retreat
of
the
federal
army
from
the
chickahominy
to
james
river
the
defeat
and
dispersion
of
the
army
of
general
pope
on
the
last
day
of
august
seemed
to
have
opened
pennsylvania
to
the
confederates
on
the
of
september
a
fortnight
afterward
general
mcclellan
at
the
head
of
a
new
army
raised
in
large
measure
by
the
magic
of
his
name
had
pursued
the
victorious
confederate
checked
his
further
advance
and
forcing
him
to
abandon
his
designs
of
invasion
brought
him
to
bay
a
hundred
miles
from
the
capital
this
was
generalship
it
would
seem
in
the
true
acceptation
of
the
term
and
mcclellan
harassed
and
hampered
by
the
authorities
who
looked
but
coldly
upon
him
could
say
with
coriolanus
alone
i
did
it
lee
was
thus
compelled
to
give
up
his
movement
in
the
direction
of
pennsylvania
and
concentrate
his
army
to
receive
the
assault
of
general
mcclellan
jackson
marching
with
his
customary
promptness
joined
him
with
a
portion
of
the
detached
force
on
the
next
day
september
and
almost
immediately
those
thunders
which
prelude
the
great
struggles
of
history
began
general
lee
had
drawn
up
his
army
on
the
high
ground
west
of
the
antietam
a
narrow
and
winding
stream
which
flows
through
fields
dotted
with
homesteads
and
clumps
of
fruit
and
forest
trees
to
the
potomac
longstreet
corps
was
posted
on
the
right
of
the
road
from
sharpsburg
to
boonsboro
his
right
flank
guarded
by
the
waters
of
the
stream
which
here
bends
westward
on
the
left
of
the
boonsboro
road
hill
command
was
stationed
two
brigades
under
general
hood
were
drawn
up
on
hill
left
and
when
jackson
arrived
lee
directed
him
to
post
his
command
on
the
left
of
hood
his
right
resting
on
the
hagerstown
road
and
his
left
extending
backward
obliquely
toward
the
potomac
here
making
a
large
bend
where
stuart
with
his
cavalry
and
occupied
the
ground
to
the
river
bank
this
arrangement
of
his
troops
was
extremely
judicious
as
the
sequel
proved
it
was
probable
that
general
mcclellan
would
direct
his
main
attack
against
the
confederate
left
with
the
view
of
turning
that
flank
and
hemming
in
the
southern
army
or
driving
it
into
the
river
by
retiring
jackson
left
lee
provided
for
this
contingency
and
it
will
be
seen
that
the
design
attributed
by
him
to
his
adversary
was
that
determined
upon
general
mcclellan
occupied
the
ground
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
antietam
he
had
evidently
massed
his
forces
opposite
the
confederate
left
but
a
heavy
order
of
battle
stood
opposite
the
centre
and
right
of
lee
where
bridges
crossed
the
stream
the
respective
numbers
of
the
adversaries
can
be
stated
with
accuracy
our
forces
at
the
battle
of
antietam
said
general
mcclellan
when
before
the
committee
of
investigation
afterward
were
total
in
action
thousand
one
hundred
and
general
lee
says
in
his
report
this
great
battle
was
fought
by
less
than
forty
thousand
men
on
our
side
colonel
walter
taylor
a
gentleman
of
the
highest
character
and
formerly
of
the
army
makes
the
confederate
numbers
somewhat
less
in
a
memorandum
before
the
writer
he
says
our
strength
at
sharpsburg
i
think
this
is
correct
jackson
including
longstreet
hill
and
walker
effective
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
total
of
all
arms
this
disproportion
was
very
great
amounting
as
it
did
to
more
than
two
for
one
but
this
was
unavoidable
the
southern
army
had
been
worn
out
by
their
long
marching
and
fighting
portions
of
the
command
were
scattered
all
over
the
roads
of
northern
virginia
wearily
dragging
their
limbs
and
shoeless
feet
toward
winchester
whither
they
were
directed
to
repair
this
was
the
explanation
of
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
the
ardent
desire
of
the
whole
army
to
participate
in
the
great
movement
northward
lee
had
in
line
of
battle
at
sharpsburg
less
than
forty
thousand
men
general
mcclellan
made
a
demonstration
against
his
adversary
on
the
evening
of
the
before
the
day
of
the
main
struggle
he
threw
his
right
commanded
by
general
hooker
across
the
antietam
at
a
point
out
of
range
of
fire
from
the
confederates
and
made
a
vigorous
attack
on
jackson
two
divisions
lying
near
the
hagerstown
road
running
northward
and
thus
parallel
with
lee
line
of
battle
a
brief
engagement
took
place
in
the
vicinity
of
the
dunker
church
in
a
fringe
of
woods
west
of
the
road
but
it
was
too
late
to
effect
any
thing
of
importance
night
fell
and
the
engagement
ceased
general
hooker
retaining
his
position
on
the
west
side
of
the
stream
the
opposing
lines
then
remained
at
rest
waiting
for
the
morning
which
all
now
saw
would
witness
the
commencement
of
the
more
serious
conflict
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
or
antietam
for
it
is
known
by
both
names
began
at
early
dawn
on
the
of
september
general
mcclellan
had
obviously
determined
to
direct
his
main
assault
against
the
confederate
left
a
movement
which
general
lee
had
foreseen
and
provided
for
and
at
dawn
commenced
a
rapid
fire
of
artillery
upon
that
portion
of
the
confederate
line
under
cover
of
this
fire
general
hooker
then
advanced
his
infantry
and
made
a
headlong
assault
upon
jackson
line
with
the
obvious
view
of
crushing
that
wing
of
lee
army
or
driving
it
back
on
sharpsburg
and
the
river
the
federal
force
making
this
attack
or
advancing
promptly
to
support
it
consisted
of
the
corps
of
generals
hooker
mansfield
and
sumner
and
numbered
according
to
general
sumner
forty
thousand
men
of
whom
eighteen
thousand
belonged
to
general
hooker
corps

in
anticipation
of
a
movement
to
turn
the
line
of
antietam
hood
two
brigades
had
been
transferred
from
the
right
to
the
left
jackson
whole
force
was
four
thousand
men
of
the
truth
of
this
statement
of
the
respective
forces
proof
is
here
given
i
have
always
believed
said
general
sumner
afterward
before
the
war
committee
that
instead
of
sending
these
troops
into
that
action
in
driblets
had
general
mcclellan
authorized
me
to
march
forty
thousand
on
the
left
flank
of
the
enemy
etc
hooker
formed
his
corps
of
men
says
swinton
the
able
and
candid
northern
historian
of
the
war
jackson
force
is
shown
by
the
confederate
official
reports
his
corps
consisted
of
ewell
division
and
jackson
old
division
general
jones
commanding
the
latter
reported
the
division
at
the
beginning
of
the
fight
numbered
not
over
one
thousand
six
hundred

the
three
brigades
to

lawton
hayes
walker
old
division
as

jackson
corps
footnote
after
general
lawton
was
disabled
this
was
the
entire
force
carried
by
general
jackson
into
the
fight
and
these
four
thousand
men
as
the
reader
will
perceive
bore
the
brunt
of
the
first
great
assault
of
general
mcclellan
just
as
the
light
broadened
in
the
east
above
the
crest
of
mountains
rising
in
rear
of
the
federal
lines
general
hooker
made
his
assault
his
aim
was
plainly
to
drive
the
force
in
his
front
across
the
hagerstown
road
and
back
on
the
potomac
and
in
this
he
seemed
about
to
succeed
jackson
had
placed
in
front
ewell
division
of
hundred
men
this
force
received
general
hooker
charge
and
a
furious
struggle
followed
in
which
the
division
was
nearly
destroyed
a
glance
at
the
casualties
will
show
this
they
were
remarkable
general

and
three
out
of
four
regimental
commanders
and
of
the
of
the
division
scarcely
one
remained
in
an
hour
after
dawn
this
heavy
slaughter
had
been
effected
in
ewell
division
and
the
detailed
statement
which
we
have
given
will
best
show
the
stubborn
resistance
offered
by
the
southern
troops
still
they
were
unable
to
hold
their
ground
and
fell
back
at
last
in
disorder
before
general
hooker
who
pressed
forward
to
seize
the
hagerstown
road
and
crush
the
whole
confederate
left
he
was
met
however
by
jackson
old
division
of
sixteen
hundred
men
who
had
been
held
in
reserve
and
general
lee
hastened
to
the
point
threatened
hood
two
small
brigades
one
of
which
general
hood
states
numbered
but
eight
hundred
and
men
with
this
force
jackson
now
met
the
advancing
column
of
general
hooker
delivering
a
heavy
fire
from
the
woods
upon
the
federal
forces
in
face
of
this
fire
they
hesitated
and
hood
made
a
vigorous
charge
general
stuart
opening
at
the
same
time
a
on
the
enemy
with
his
the
combined
fire
increased
their
disorganization
and
it
now
turned
into
disorder
jackson
seized
the
moment
as
always
throwing
forward
his
whole
line
and
the
enemy
were
first
checked
and
then
driven
back
in
confusion
the
confederates
pursuing
and
cheering
the
first
struggle
had
thus
resulted
in
favor
of
the
confederates
with
about
six
thousand
they
had
repulsed
eighteen
thousand
and
it
was
obvious
to
general
mcclellan
that
without
reinforcements
his
right
could
not
hold
its
ground
he
accordingly
just
at
sunrise
sent
general
mansfield
corps
to
the
aid
of
general
hooker
and
at
nine
general
sumner
corps
was
added
making
in
all
forty
thousand
men
the
appearance
of
affairs
at
this
moment
was
discouraging
to
the
federal
commander
his
heavy
assaulting
column
had
been
forced
back
with
great
slaughter
general
hooker
had
been
wounded
and
borne
from
the
field
general
mansfield
while
forming
his
line
had
been
mortally
wounded
and
now
at
nine
when
the
corps
of
general
sumner
arrived
the
prospect
was
depressing
of
the
condition
of
the
federal
forces
general
sumner
own
statement
conveys
a
very
distinct
conception
on
going
upon
the
field
said
general
sumner
before
the
war
committee
i
found
that
general
hooker
corps
had
been
dispersed
and
routed
i
passed
him
some
distance
in
the
rear
where
he
had
been
carried
wounded
but
i
saw
nothing
of
his
corps
at
all
as
i
was
advancing
with
my
command
on
the
field
i
sent
one
of
my
to
find
where
they
were
and
general
ricketts
the
only
officer
we
could
find
stated
that
he
could
not
raise
three
hundred
men
of
the
corps
general
mansfield
corps
also
had
been
checked
and
now
began
to
waver
and
break
such
had
been
the
result
of
the
great
federal
assault
and
it
was
highly
creditable
to
the
confederate
arms
with
a
comparatively
insignificant
force
jackson
had
received
the
attack
of
the
entire
federal
right
wing
and
had
not
only
repulsed
but
nearly
broken
to
pieces
the
large
force
in
his
front
the
arrival
of
general
sumner
however
completely
changed
the
face
of
affairs
and
as
his
fresh
troops
advanced
those
which
had
been
so
roughly
handled
by
jackson
had
an
opportunity
to
reform
this
was
rapidly
effected
and
having
marshalled
his
troops
general
sumner
an
officer
of
great
dash
and
courage
made
a
vigorous
charge
from
this
moment
the
battle
began
to
rage
with
new
fury
general
lee
had
sent
to
the
left
the
brigades
of
colquitt
ripley
and
mcrae
and
with
these
the
troops
of
hood
and
his
own
shattered
division
jackson
presented
a
stubborn
front
but
his
loss
was
heavy
general
starke
of
the
old
division
was
killed
the
brigade
regimental
and
company
officers
fell
almost
without
an
exception
and
the
brigades
dwindled
to
mere
handfuls
under
the
great
pressure
jackson
was
at
length
forced
back
one
of
general
sumner
divisions
drove
the
right
of
the
confederates
beyond
the
hagerstown
road
and
at
this
moment
the
long
struggle
seemed
ended
the
great
wrestle
in
which
the
adversaries
had
so
long
staggered
to
and
fro
advancing
and
retreating
in
turn
seemed
at
last
virtually
decided
in
favor
of
the
federal
arms
this
was
undoubtedly
the
of
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
and
general
lee
had
witnessed
the
conflict
upon
his
left
with
great
anxiety
it
was
impossible
however
to
send
thither
more
troops
than
he
had
already
sent
as
will
be
seen
in
a
moment
both
his
centre
and
right
were
extremely
weak
hill
and
general
mclaws
had
not
arrived
from
harper
ferry
thus
the
left
had
been
reënforced
to
the
full
extent
of
lee
ability
and
now
that
portion
of
his
line
seemed
about
to
be
crushed
fortunately
however
general
mclaws
who
had
been
delayed
longer
than
was
expected
by
general
lee
at
last
arrived
and
was
hurried
to
the
left
it
was
ten
and
in
that
one
hour
the
fighting
of
an
entire
day
seemed
to
have
been
concentrated
jackson
was
holding
his
ground
with
difficulty
when
the
divisions
of
mclaws
and
walker
were
sent
to
him
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
field
they
were
thrown
into
action
and
general
lee
had
the
satisfaction
of
witnessing
a
new
order
of
things
the
advance
it
might
rather
be
called
the
onward
rush
of
the
federal
line
was
checked
jackson
weary
men
took
fresh
heart
that
great
commander
promptly
assumed
the
offensive
and
advancing
his
whole
line
drove
the
enemy
before
him
until
he
reoccupied
the
ground
from
which
general
sumner
had
forced
him
to
retire
from
the
ground
thus
occupied
the
federal
forces
were
unable
to
dislodge
him
and
the
great
struggle
of
the
left
at
sharpsburg
was
over
it
had
begun
at
dawn
and
was
decided
by
ten
or
eleven
and
the
troops
on
both
sides
had
fought
as
resolutely
as
in
any
other
action
of
the
war
the
event
had
been
decided
by
the
pertinacity
of
the
southern
troops
and
by
the
prompt
movement
of
reënforcements
by
general
lee
from
his
right
and
centre
posted
near
his
centre
he
had
surveyed
at
one
glance
the
whole
field
of
action
the
design
of
general
mcclellan
to
direct
his
main
assault
upon
the
confederate
left
was
promptly
penetrated
and
the
rapid
concentration
of
the
southern
forces
in
that
quarter
had
by
defeating
this
movement
decided
the
result
of
the
battle
attacks
on
the
confederate
centre
and
right
followed
that
upon
the
left
in
the
centre
a
great
disaster
was
at
one
time
imminent
owing
to
a
mistake
of
orders
the
brave
general
rhodes
had
drawn
back
his
brigade
posted
there
this
was
seen
by
the
enemy
and
a
sudden
rush
was
made
by
them
with
the
view
of
piercing
lee
centre
the
promptness
and
courage
of
a
few
officers
and
a
small
body
of
troops
defeated
this
attempt
general
hill
rallied
a
few
hundred
men
and
opened
fire
with
a
single
gun
and
colonel
cooke
faced
the
enemy
with
his
regiment
standing
boldly
in
line
says
general
lee
without
a
cartridge
the
stand
made
by
this
small
force
saved
the
army
from
serious
disaster
the
federal
line
retired
but
a
last
assault
was
soon
begun
this
time
against
the
confederate
right
it
continued
in
a
somewhat
desultory
manner
until
four
in
the
evening
when
having
massed
a
heavy
column
under
general
burnside
opposite
the
bridge
in
front
of
lee
right
wing
general
mcclellan
forced
the
bridge
and
carried
the
crest
beyond
the
moment
was
critical
as
the
confederate
force
at
this
point
was
less
than
three
thousand
men
but
fortunately
reënforcements
arrived
consisting
of
hill
forces
from
harper
ferry
these
attacked
the
enemy
drove
him
from
the
hill
across
the
antietam
again
and
so
threatening
did
the
situation
at
that
moment
appear
to
general
mcclellan
that
he
is
said
to
have
sent
general
burnside
the
message
hold
your
ground
if
you
can
not
then
the
bridge
to
the
last
man
always
the
bridge
if
the
bridge
is
lost
all
is
lost
the
urgency
of
this
order
sufficiently
indicates
that
the
federal
commander
was
not
without
solicitude
for
the
safety
of
his
own
left
wing
ignorant
doubtless
of
the
extremely
small
force
which
had
thus
repulsed
general
burnside
in
all
four
thousand
five
hundred
men
he
feared
that
general
lee
would
cross
the
bridge
assail
his
left
and
that
the
day
might
end
in
disaster
to
his
own
army
that
general
lee
contemplated
this
movement
in
spite
of
the
disproportion
of
numbers
is
intimated
in
his
official
report
it
was
nearly
dark
he
says
and
the
federal
artillery
was
massed
to
defend
the
bridge
with
general
porter
corps
consisting
of
fresh
troops
behind
it
under
these
circumstances
he
adds
it
was
deemed
injudicious
to
push
our
advantage
further
in
the
face
of
fresh
troops
of
the
enemy
much
exceeding
our
own
the
idea
of
an
advance
against
the
federal
left
was
accordingly
abandoned
and
a
movement
of
jackson
command
which
lee
directed
with
the
view
of
turning
the
federal
right
was
discontinued
from
the
same
considerations
night
had
come
both
sides
were
worn
out
neither
of
the
two
great
adversaries
cared
to
risk
another
struggle
and
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
was
over
the
two
armies
remained
facing
each
other
throughout
the
following
day
during
the
night
of
this
day
lee
crossed
with
his
army
back
into
virginia
he
states
his
reasons
for
this
as
we
could
not
look
for
a
material
increase
of
strength
he
says
and
the
enemy
force
could
be
largely
and
rapidly
augmented
it
was
not
thought
prudent
to
wait
until
he
should
be
ready
again
to
offer
battle
general
mcclellan
does
not
seem
to
have
been
able
to
renew
the
struggle
at
that
time
the
next
morning
he
says
referring
to
the
day
succeeding
the
battle
i
found
that
our
loss
had
been
so
great
and
there
was
so
much
disorganization
in
some
of
the
commands
that
i
did
not
consider
it
proper
to
renew
the
attack
that
day
this
decision
of
general
mcclellan
subjected
him
subsequently
to
very
harsh
criticism
from
the
federal
authorities
the
theory
having
obtained
at
washington
that
he
had
had
it
in
his
power
by
renewing
the
battle
to
cut
lee
to
pieces
of
the
probability
of
such
a
result
the
reader
will
form
his
own
judgment
the
ground
for
such
a
conclusion
seems
slight
the
loss
and
disorganization
were
it
would
seem
even
greater
on
the
federal
than
on
the
confederate
side
and
lee
would
have
probably
been
better
able
to
sustain
an
attack
than
general
mcclellan
to
make
it
it
will
be
seen
that
general
meade
afterward
under
circumstances
more
favorable
still
declined
to
attack
lee
at
williamsport
if
one
of
the
two
commanders
be
greatly
censured
the
other
must
be
also
and
the
world
will
be
always
apt
to
conclude
that
they
knew
what
could
be
effected
better
than
the
civilians
but
general
mcclellan
did
make
an
attempt
to
crush
lee
such
as
the
authorities
at
washington
desired
and
its
result
may
possibly
throw
light
on
the
point
in
discussion
on
the
night
of
the
lee
having
crossed
the
potomac
on
the
night
of
the
general
mcclellan
sent
a
considerable
force
across
the
river
near
shepherdstown
which
drove
off
the
confederate
artillery
there
and
at
daylight
formed
line
of
battle
on
the
south
bank
protected
by
their
cannon
north
of
the
river
of
the
brief
but
bloody
engagement
which
followed
an
incident
of
the
war
little
dwelt
upon
in
the
histories
general
hill
who
was
sent
by
lee
to
repulse
the
enemy
gives
an
animated
account
the
federal
artillery
to
the
number
of
seventy
pieces
he
says
lined
the
opposite
heights
and
their
infantry
was
strongly
posted
on
the
crest
of
the
virginia
hills
when
he
advanced
with
his
division
he
was
met
by
the
most
tremendous
fire
of
artillery
he
ever
saw
but
the
men
continued
to
move
on
without
wavering
and
the
attack
resulted
in
the
complete
rout
of
the
enemy
who
were
driven
into
the
river
the
current
of
which
was
blue
with
floating
bodies
general
hill
chronicles
this
incident
in
terms
of
unwonted
eloquence
and
declares
that
by
the
account
of
the
enemy
themselves
they
lost
three
thousand
men
killed
and
drowned
from
one
brigade
which
appears
to
be
an
exaggeration
his
own
loss
was
in
killed
and
wounded
two
hundred
and
this
repulse
was
decisive
and
general
mcclellan
made
no
further
attempt
to
pursue
the
adversary
who
standing
at
bay
on
the
soil
of
virginia
was
still
more
formidable
than
he
had
been
on
the
soil
of
maryland
as
we
have
intimated
on
a
preceding
page
the
result
of
this
attempt
to
pursue
would
seem
to
relieve
general
mcclellan
from
the
criticism
of
the
washington
authorities
if
he
was
repulsed
with
heavy
slaughter
in
his
attempt
to
strike
at
lee
on
the
morning
of
september
it
is
not
probable
that
an
assault
on
his
adversary
on
september
would
have
had
different
results
no
further
crossing
at
that
time
was
undertaken
by
the
federal
commander
his
army
was
moved
toward
harper
ferry
an
important
base
for
further
operations
and
lee
army
went
into
camp
along
the
banks
of
the
opequan
vi
lee
and
mcclellan
their
merits
in
the
maryland
campaign
general
lee
and
his
adversary
had
displayed
conspicuous
merit
in
the
campaign
thus
terminated
and
we
shall
pause
for
a
moment
to
glance
back
upon
this
great
passage
at
arms
to
give
precedence
to
general
mcclellan
he
had
assembled
an
army
after
the
defeat
at
manassas
with
a
promptness
for
which
only
his
own
great
personal
popularity
can
adequately
account
had
advanced
to
check
lee
and
had
fully
succeeded
in
doing
so
and
had
thus
not
only
protected
the
fertile
territory
of
pennsylvania
from
invasion
but
had
struck
a
for
the
time
to
any
designs
general
lee
might
have
had
to
advance
on
the
federal
capital
if
the
situation
of
affairs
at
that
moment
be
attentively
considered
the
extreme
importance
of
these
results
will
not
fail
to
appear
it
may
perhaps
be
said
with
justice
that
general
mcclellan
had
saved
the
federal
cause
from
decisive
defeat
there
was
no
army
to
protect
washington
but
the
body
of
troops
under
his
command
these
were
largely
raw
levies
which
defeat
would
have
broken
to
pieces
and
thus
the
way
would
have
been
open
for
lee
march
upon
washington
or
toward
philadelphia
a
movement
whose
probable
result
would
have
been
a
treaty
of
peace
and
the
independence
of
the
southern
confederacy
all
these
hopes
were
reversed
by
mcclellan
rapid
march
and
prompt
attack
in
the
hours
of
a
single
autumn
day
on
the
banks
of
the
antietam
the
triumphant
advance
of
the
confederates
was
checked
and
defeated
and
if
the
further
fact
be
considered
that
the
adversary
thus
checkmated
was
lee
the
military
ability
of
general
mcclellan
must
be
conceded
it
is
the
fashion
it
would
appear
in
some
quarters
to
deny
him
this
quality
history
will
decide
the
merit
of
lee
was
equally
conspicuous
and
his
partial
failure
in
the
campaign
was
due
to
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
control
his
plan
as
was
always
the
case
with
him
was
and
every
contingency
had
been
provided
for
he
was
disappointed
in
his
aim
by
three
causes
which
he
could
not
foresee
one
was
the
great
diminution
of
his
force
owing
to
the
rapidity
of
his
march
and
the
incessant
fighting
another
the
failure
in
obtaining
recruits
in
maryland
and
a
third
the
discovery
by
general
mcclellan
of
the
lost
dispatch
as
it
is
called
which
revealed
lee
whole
plan
to
his
adversary
in
consequence
of
the
finding
of
the
order
of
march
mcclellan
advanced
with
such
rapidity
that
the
laggards
of
the
southern
army
on
the
hills
north
of
leesburg
had
no
opportunity
of
joining
the
main
body
the
gaps
in
the
ranks
of
the
army
thus
made
were
not
filled
up
by
maryland
recruits
lee
fell
back
and
his
adversary
followed
no
longer
fearful
of
advancing
too
quickly
jackson
had
no
time
after
reducing
ferry
to
rejoin
lee
at
hagerstown
thus
concentration
of
his
troops
and
a
battle
somewhere
near
sharpsburg
were
rendered
a
necessity
with
general
lee
in
this
tissue
of
adverse
events
the
discovery
of
the
order
of
march
by
general
mcclellan
occupies
a
very
prominent
place
this
incident
resembles
what
the
french
call
a
fatality
who
was
to
blame
for
the
circumstance
still
remains
a
mystery
but
it
may
be
said
with
entire
certainty
that
the
brave
officer
upon
whom
it
was
charged
was
entirely
guiltless
of
all
fault
in
the
matter
footnote
the
officer
here
referred
to
is
general
hill
general
mcclellan
said
in
his
testimony
afterward
before
the
congressional
committee
when
at
frederick
we
found
the
original
order
issued
to
hill
etc
the
inference
was
thus
a
natural
one
that
general
hill
was
to
blame
but
that
officer
has
proved
clearly
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
he
received
but
one
copy
of
the
order
which
was
handed
to
him
by
general
jackson
in
person
and
knowing
its
great
importance
he
placed
it
in
his
and
still
retains
it
in
his
possession
this
fact
is
conclusive
since
general
hill
could
not
have
lost
what
he
continues
to
hold
in
his
hands
this
mystery
will
be
cleared
up
at
some
time
probably
at
present
but
one
thing
is
certain
that
general
hill
was
in
no
manner
to
blame
the
present
writer
desires
to
make
this
statement
as
explicit
as
possible
as
in
other
accounts
of
these
transactions
he
was
led
by
general
mcclellan
language
to
attribute
blame
to
general
hill
where
he
deserved
none
whatever
may
have
been
the
secret
history
of
the
lost
dispatch
however
it
certainly
fell
into
general
mcclellan
hands
and
largely
directed
the
subsequent
movements
of
the
opposing
armies
from
what
is
here
written
it
will
be
seen
that
lee
was
not
justly
chargeable
with
the
result
of
the
maryland
campaign
he
had
provided
for
every
thing
as
far
as
lay
in
his
power
had
he
not
been
disappointed
in
events
to
be
fairly
anticipated
it
seemed
his
force
would
have
received
large
accessions
his
rear
would
have
closed
up
and
the
advance
into
pennsylvania
would
have
taken
place
instead
of
this
he
was
forced
to
retire
and
fight
a
pitched
battle
at
sharpsburg
and
this
action
certainly
exhibited
on
lee
part
military
ability
of
the
highest
order
the
force
opposed
to
him
had
been
at
least
double
that
of
his
own
army
and
the
federal
troops
had
fought
with
a
gallantry
unsurpassed
in
any
other
engagement
of
the
war
that
their
assault
on
lee
failed
was
due
to
the
fighting
qualities
of
his
troops
and
his
own
generalship
his
army
had
been
manoeuvred
with
a
rapidity
and
precision
which
must
have
excited
even
the
admiration
of
the
distinguished
soldier
opposed
to
him
he
had
promptly
concentrated
his
forces
opposite
every
threatened
point
in
turn
and
if
he
had
not
been
able
to
carry
out
the
axiom
of
napoleon
that
a
commander
should
always
be
superior
to
the
enemy
at
the
point
of
contact
he
had
at
least
done
all
that
was
possible
to
effect
that
end
and
had
so
far
succeeded
as
to
have
repulsed
if
not
routed
his
adversary
this
is
the
main
feature
to
be
noticed
in
lee
handling
of
his
troops
at
sharpsburg
an
unwary
or
inactive
commander
would
have
there
suffered
decisive
defeat
for
the
confederate
left
wing
numbered
throughout
the
early
part
of
the
battle
scarcely
more
than
four
thousand
men
while
the
column
directed
against
it
amounted
first
to
eighteen
thousand
and
in
all
to
forty
thousand
men
to
meet
the
impact
of
this
heavy
mass
not
only
desperate
fighting
but
rapid
and
skilful
manoeuvring
was
necessary
the
record
we
have
presented
will
enable
the
reader
to
form
his
own
opinion
whether
lee
was
equal
to
this
emergency
involving
the
fate
of
his
army
military
critics
examining
this
great
battle
with
fair
and
candid
eyes
will
not
fail
we
think
to
discern
the
truth
that
the
southern
army
of
less
than
forty
thousand
men
repulsed
more
than
eighty
thousand
in
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
was
due
to
the
hard
fighting
of
the
smaller
force
and
the
skill
with
which
its
commander
manoeuvred
it
vii
lee
and
his
men
general
lee
and
his
army
passed
the
brilliant
days
of
autumn
in
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
shenandoah
this
region
is
famous
for
its
salubrity
and
the
beauty
of
its
scenery
the
mountain
winds
are
pure
and
invigorating
and
the
forests
which
in
the
season
of
autumn
assume
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
inspire
the
mind
with
the
most
agreeable
sensations
the
region
in
fact
is
known
as
the
garden
of
virginia
and
the
benign
influence
of
their
surroundings
was
soon
seen
on
the
faces
of
the
troops
a
northern
writer
who
saw
them
at
sharpsburg
describes
them
as
ragged
hungry
and
in
all
ways
miserable
but
their
forlorn
condition
as
to
clothing
and
supplies
of
every
description
made
no
perceptible
difference
in
their
demeanor
now
in
their
camps
along
the
banks
of
the
picturesque
little
stream
called
the
opequan
which
rising
south
of
winchester
wanders
through
beautiful
fields
and
forests
to
empty
into
the
potomac
the
troops
laughed
jested
sang
rude
and
exhibited
a
joyous
indifference
to
their
privations
and
hardships
which
said
much
for
their
courage
and
endurance
those
who
carefully
considered
the
appearance
and
demeanor
of
the
men
at
that
time
saw
that
much
could
be
effected
with
such
tough
material
and
had
another
opportunity
to
witness
under
circumstances
calculated
to
test
it
the
careless
indifference
to
the
past
as
well
as
the
future
peculiar
alike
to
soldiers
and
children
these
men
who
had
passed
through
a
campaign
of
hard
marches
and
nearly
incessant
battles
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
their
troubles
and
sufferings
the
immense
strain
upon
their
energies
had
left
them
apparently
as
fresh
and
efficient
as
when
the
campaign
begun
there
was
no
want
of
rebound
rather
an
excessive
elasticity
and
readiness
to
undertake
new
movements
they
had
plainly
acquired
confidence
in
themselves
rightly
regarding
the
event
of
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
where
they
were
so
largely
outnumbered
as
highly
honorable
to
them
and
they
had
acquired
still
greater
confidence
in
the
officers
who
commanded
them
we
shall
hereafter
speak
more
particularly
of
the
sentiment
of
the
troops
toward
general
lee
at
this
period
of
his
connection
with
the
army
the
great
events
of
the
war
continually
modified
the
relations
between
him
and
his
men
as
they
came
to
know
him
better
and
better
he
steadily
rose
in
their
admiration
and
regard
at
this
time
the
autumn
of
it
may
be
said
that
the
troops
had
already
begun
to
love
their
leader
and
had
bestowed
upon
him
as
an
army
commander
their
implicit
confidence
without
this
confidence
on
the
part
of
his
men
a
general
can
effect
little
with
it
he
may
accomplish
almost
any
thing
the
common
soldier
is
a
child
and
feels
that
the
directing
authority
is
above
him
that
he
should
look
upon
that
authority
with
respect
and
confidence
is
the
first
necessity
of
effecting
military
organization
lee
had
already
inspired
the
troops
with
this
sentiment
and
it
was
mainly
the
secret
of
his
often
astounding
successes
afterward
the
men
universally
felt
that
their
commander
was
equal
to
any
and
every
emergency
such
a
repute
can
not
be
usurped
troops
measure
their
leaders
with
instinctive
acumen
and
a
very
astonishing
accuracy
they
form
their
opinions
for
themselves
on
the
merits
of
the
question
and
lee
had
already
impressed
the
army
with
a
profound
admiration
for
his
soldiership
from
this
to
the
sentiment
of
personal
affection
the
transition
was
easy
and
the
kindness
consideration
and
simplicity
of
the
man
made
all
love
him
throughout
the
campaign
lee
had
not
been
heard
to
utter
one
harsh
word
a
patient
forbearance
and
kindness
had
been
constantly
exhibited
in
all
his
dealings
with
officers
and
men
he
was
always
in
front
indifferent
plainly
to
personal
danger
and
the
men
looked
now
with
admiring
eyes
and
a
feeling
of
affection
on
the
erect
soldierly
figure
in
the
plain
uniform
with
scarce
any
indication
of
rank
and
the
calm
face
with
its
expression
of
grave
dignity
and
composure
which
remained
unchanged
equally
on
the
march
and
in
battle
it
may
be
said
that
when
he
assumed
command
of
the
army
before
richmond
the
troops
had
taken
him
on
trust
now
they
had
come
to
love
him
and
when
he
appeared
the
camps
buzzed
the
men
ran
to
the
road
called
out
to
each
other
there
goes
mas
robert
or
old
uncle
robert
and
cheers
followed
him
as
he
rode
by
the
country
generally
seemed
to
share
the
opinion
of
the
army
there
was
exhibited
even
at
this
early
period
of
the
war
by
the
people
at
large
a
very
great
admiration
and
affection
for
general
lee
while
in
the
shenandoah
valley
where
jackson
was
beloved
almost
beyond
expression
lee
had
evidences
of
the
position
which
he
occupied
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
which
must
have
been
extremely
gratifying
to
him
men
came
to
his
camp
and
uttered
prayers
for
his
health
and
happiness
as
the
great
leader
of
the
south
aged
ladies
greeted
him
with
faltering
expressions
full
of
deep
feeling
and
pathetic
earnestness
and
wherever
he
went
young
girls
and
children
received
him
with
their
brightest
smiles
the
august
fame
of
the
great
soldier
who
has
now
passed
away
no
doubt
renders
these
memories
of
personal
interviews
with
him
dear
to
many
even
the
most
trifling
incidents
are
cherished
and
kept
fresh
by
repetition
and
the
writer
of
these
pages
recalls
at
the
moment
one
of
these
trifles
which
may
possibly
interest
some
readers
there
stood
and
still
stands
an
ancient
and
hospitable
homestead
on
the
south
bank
of
the
opequan
the
hearts
of
whose
inmates
one
and
all
were
ardently
with
the
south
in
her
struggle
soon
after
sharpsburg
general
lee
one
day
visited
the
old
crowning
the
grassy
hill
and
overshadowed
by
great
oaks
generals
jackson
longstreet
and
stuart
accompanied
him
and
the
reception
which
he
met
with
though
we
can
not
describe
it
was
such
as
would
have
satisfied
the
most
exacting
the
children
came
to
him
and
held
out
their
small
hands
the
ladies
divided
their
attention
between
him
and
the
beloved
hero
of
the
valley
jackson
and
the
lady
of
the
manor
could
only
express
her
sense
of
the
great
honor
of
receiving
such
company
by
declaring
with
a
smile
that
the
dinner
resembled
the
famous
at
in
scott
old
mortality
general
lee
highly
enjoyed
this
and
seemed
disposed
to
laugh
when
the
curious
fact
was
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
had
seated
himself
at
table
in
a
chair
with
an
states
delineated
upon
its
back
the
result
of
this
visit
it
appeared
afterward
was
a
sentiment
of
great
regard
and
affection
for
the
general
personally
by
all
at
the
old
old
and
young
were
charmed
by
his
grave
sweetness
and
mild
courtesy
and
doubtless
he
inspired
the
same
sentiment
in
other
places
his
headquarters
were
at
this
time
in
a
field
some
miles
from
winchester
an
englishman
who
visited
him
there
described
the
general
and
his
surroundings
with
accuracy
and
from
the
account
printed
in
we
quote
the
following
sentences
in
visiting
the
headquarters
of
the
confederate
generals
but
particularly
those
of
general
lee
any
one
accustomed
to
see
european
armies
in
the
field
can
not
fail
to
be
struck
with
the
great
absence
of
all
the
and
circumstance
of
war
in
and
around
their
encampments
lee
headquarters
consisted
of
about
seven
or
eight
pitched
with
their
backs
to
a
stake
fence
upon
a
piece
of
ground
so
rocky
that
it
was
unpleasant
to
ride
over
it
its
only
recommendation
being
a
little
stream
of
good
water
which
flowed
close
by
the
general
tent
in
front
of
the
tents
were
some
three
wagons
drawn
up
without
any
regularity
and
a
number
of
horses
roamed
loose
about
the
field
the
servants
who
were
of
course
slaves
and
the
mounted
soldiers
called
who
always
accompany
each
general
of
division
in
the
field
were
unprovided
with
tents
and
slept
in
or
under
the
wagons
wagons
tents
and
some
of
the
horses
were
marked
showing
that
part
of
that
huge
debt
in
the
north
has
gone
to
furnishing
even
the
confederate
generals
with
camp
equipments
no
guard
or
sentries
were
to
be
seen
in
the
vicinity
no
crowd
of
loitering
about
making
themselves
agreeable
to
visitors
and
endeavoring
to
save
their
generals
from
receiving
those
who
had
no
particular
business
a
large
stands
close
by
which
in
any
other
army
would
have
been
the
general
residence
but
as
no
liberties
are
allowed
to
be
taken
with
personal
property
in
lee
army
he
is
particular
in
setting
a
good
example
himself
his
staff
are
crowded
together
two
or
three
in
a
tent
none
are
allowed
to
carry
more
baggage
than
a
small
box
each
and
his
own
kit
is
but
very
little
larger
every
one
who
approaches
him
does
so
with
marked
respect
although
there
is
none
of
that
bowing
and
flourishing
of
forage
caps
which
occurs
in
the
presence
of
european
generals
and
while
all
honor
him
and
place
implicit
faith
in
his
courage
and
ability
those
with
whom
he
is
most
intimate
feel
for
him
the
affection
of
sons
to
a
father
old
general
scott
was
correct
in
saying
that
when
lee
joined
the
southern
cause
it
was
worth
as
much
as
the
accession
of
twenty
thousand
men
to
the
since
then
every
injury
that
it
was
possible
to
inflict
the
northerners
have
heaped
upon
him
notwithstanding
all
these
personal
losses
however
when
speaking
of
the
yankees
he
neither
evinced
any
bitterness
of
feeling
nor
gave
utterance
to
a
single
violent
expression
but
alluded
to
many
of
his
former
friends
and
companions
among
them
in
the
kindest
terms
he
spoke
as
a
man
proud
of
the
victories
won
by
his
country
and
confident
of
ultimate
success
under
the
blessing
of
the
almighty
whom
he
glorified
for
past
successes
and
whose
aid
he
invoked
for
all
future
operations
the
writer
adds
that
the
troops
regarded
him
in
the
light
of
infallible
love
and
had
a
fixed
and
unshakable
faith
in
all
he
did
a
calm
confidence
of
victory
when
serving
under
him
the
peculiarly
interesting
part
of
this
foreign
testimony
however
is
that
in
which
the
writer
speaks
of
general
lee
religious
sentiment
of
his
gratitude
for
past
mercies
and
prayers
for
the
assistance
of
the
almighty
in
the
hours
of
conflict
still
to
come
this
point
we
shall
return
to
endeavoring
to
give
it
that
prominence
which
it
deserves
at
present
we
shall
leave
the
subject
of
general
lee
in
his
private
and
personal
character
and
proceed
to
narrate
the
last
campaign
of
the
year
viii
lee
passes
the
blue
ridge
from
the
central
frontier
of
his
headquarters
near
winchester
the
key
of
the
lower
valley
general
lee
was
able
to
watch
at
once
the
line
of
the
potomac
in
his
front
beyond
which
lay
general
army
and
the
gaps
of
the
blue
ridge
on
his
right
through
which
it
was
possible
for
the
enemy
by
a
rapid
movement
to
advance
and
attack
his
flank
and
rear
if
lee
had
at
any
time
the
design
of
recrossing
into
maryland
he
abandoned
it
general
mcclellan
attributed
that
design
to
him
i
have
since
been
confirmed
in
the
belief
he
wrote
that
if
i
had
crossed
the
potomac
below
harper
ferry
in
the
early
part
of
october
general
lee
would
have
recrossed
into
maryland
of
lee
ability
to
thus
reënter
maryland
there
can
be
no
doubt
his
army
was
rested
provisioned
and
in
high
spirits
the
stragglers
had
rejoined
their
commands
and
it
is
certain
that
the
order
for
a
new
advance
would
have
been
hailed
by
the
mercurial
troops
with
enthusiasm
no
such
order
was
however
issued
and
soon
the
approach
of
winter
rendered
the
movement
impossible
more
than
a
month
thus
passed
the
two
armies
remaining
in
face
of
each
other
no
engagement
of
any
importance
occurred
during
this
period
of
inactivity
but
once
or
twice
the
federal
commander
sent
heavy
reconnoitring
forces
across
the
potomac
and
stuart
now
mounting
to
the
zenith
of
his
reputation
as
a
repeated
his
famous
ride
around
mcclellan
on
the
chickahominy
the
object
of
general
lee
in
directing
this
movement
of
the
cavalry
was
the
ordinary
one
on
such
occasions
of
obtaining
information
and
inflicting
injury
upon
the
enemy
stuart
responded
with
ardor
to
the
order
he
had
conceived
a
warm
affection
for
general
lee
mingled
with
a
respect
for
his
military
genius
nearly
unbounded
and
at
this
time
as
always
afterward
received
the
orders
of
his
commander
for
active
operations
with
enthusiasm
with
about
eighteen
hundred
troopers
and
four
pieces
of
stuart
crossed
the
potomac
above
williamsport
marched
rapidly
to
chambersburg
in
pennsylvania
where
he
destroyed
the
and
other
buildings
containing
a
large
number
of
arms
and
military
stores
and
continued
his
way
thence
toward
frederick
city
with
the
bold
design
of
completely
passing
around
the
federal
army
and
recrossing
the
river
east
of
the
blue
ridge
in
this
he
succeeded
thanks
to
his
skill
and
audacity
in
spite
of
every
effort
of
the
enemy
to
cut
off
and
destroy
him
reaching
white
ford
on
the
potomac
north
of
leesburg
he
disposed
his
so
as
to
cover
this
movement
cut
his
way
through
the
federal
cavalry
disputing
his
passage
and
recrossed
into
virginia
with
a
large
number
of
captured
horses
and
without
losing
a
man
this
expedition
excited
astonishment
and
a
prominent
officer
of
the
federal
army
declared
that
he
would
not
have
believed
that
could
stand
it
as
the
distance
passed
over
in
about
hours
during
which
considerable
delay
had
occurred
at
chambersburg
was
nearly
or
quite
one
hundred
miles
general
mcclellan
complained
that
his
orders
had
not
been
obeyed
and
said
that
after
these
orders
he
did
not
think
it
possible
for
stuart
to
recross
and
believed
the
destruction
or
capture
of
his
entire
force
perfectly
certain
soon
afterward
the
federal
commander
attempted
reconnoissances
in
his
turn
a
considerable
force
of
infantry
supported
by
artillery
crossed
the
potomac
and
advanced
to
the
vicinity
of
the
little
village
of
leetown
but
on
the
same
evening
fell
back
rapidly
doubtless
fearful
that
lee
would
interpose
a
force
between
them
and
the
river
and
cut
off
their
retreat
this
was
followed
by
a
movement
of
the
federal
cavalry
which
crossed
at
the
same
spot
and
advanced
up
the
road
leading
toward
martinsburg
these
were
met
and
subsequently
driven
back
by
colonel
lee
son
of
the
general
a
third
and
more
important
attempt
to
reconnoitre
took
place
toward
the
end
of
october
general
mcclellan
then
crossed
a
considerable
body
of
troops
both
at
shepherdstown
and
harper
ferry
the
columns
advanced
to
kearneysville
and
charlestown
respectively
and
near
the
former
village
a
brief
engagement
took
place
without
results
general
mcclellan
who
had
come
in
person
as
far
as
charlestown
then
returned
with
his
troops
across
the
potomac
and
further
hostilities
for
the
moment
ceased
these
reconnoissances
were
the
prelude
however
of
an
important
movement
which
the
federal
authorities
had
been
long
urging
general
mcclellan
to
make
although
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
had
been
indecisive
in
one
acceptation
of
the
term
in
another
it
had
been
entirely
decisive
a
drawn
battle
of
the
clearest
sort
it
yet
decided
the
future
movements
of
the
opposing
armies
general
lee
had
invaded
maryland
with
the
design
of
advancing
into
pennsylvania
the
result
of
sharpsburg
was
that
he
fell
back
into
virginia
general
mcclellan
had
marched
from
washington
with
no
object
but
an
campaign
to
afford
the
capital
protection
he
was
now
enabled
to
undertake
anew
the
invasion
of
virginia
to
the
success
of
such
a
movement
the
federal
commander
seems
rightly
to
have
considered
a
full
and
complete
equipment
of
his
troops
absolutely
essential
he
was
directed
at
once
after
sharpsburg
to
advance
upon
lee
he
replied
that
it
was
impossible
neither
his
men
nor
his
horses
had
shoes
or
rations
new
orders
came
general
halleck
appearing
to
regard
the
difficulties
urged
by
general
mcclellan
as
imaginary
new
protests
followed
and
then
new
protests
and
new
orders
again
until
finally
a
peremptory
dispatch
came
this
dispatch
was
cross
the
potomac
and
give
battle
to
the
enemy
or
drive
him
south
an
order
bearing
the
impress
of
the
terse
good
sense
and
rough
directness
of
the
federal
president
this
order
it
was
necessary
in
the
end
to
obey
and
general
mcclellan
having
decided
in
favor
of
a
movement
across
the
potomac
east
instead
of
west
of
the
mountain
proceeded
in
the
last
days
of
october
to
cross
his
army
his
plan
was
excellent
and
is
here
set
forth
in
his
own
words
the
plan
of
campaign
i
adopted
during
this
advance
he
says
was
to
move
the
army
well
in
hand
parallel
to
the
blue
ridge
taking
warrenton
as
the
point
of
direction
for
the
main
army
seizing
each
pass
on
the
blue
ridge
by
detachments
as
we
approached
it
and
guarding
them
after
we
had
passed
as
long
as
they
would
enable
the
enemy
to
trouble
our
communications
with
the
potomac
we
depended
upon
harper
ferry
and
berlin
for
supplies
until
the
manassas
gap
railway
was
reached
when
that
occurred
the
passes
in
our
rear
were
to
be
abandoned
and
the
army
massed
ready
for
action
or
movement
in
any
direction
it
was
my
intention
if
upon
reaching
ashby
or
any
other
pass
the
enemy
were
in
force
between
it
and
the
potomac
in
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
to
move
into
the
valley
and
endeavor
to
gain
their
rear
from
this
statement
of
general
mcclellan
it
will
be
seen
that
his
plan
was
judicious
and
displayed
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
country
in
which
he
was
about
to
operate
the
conformation
of
the
region
is
peculiar
the
valley
of
the
shenandoah
in
which
lee
army
lay
waiting
is
separated
from
piedmont
virginia
through
which
general
mcclellan
was
about
to
advance
by
the
wooded
ramparts
of
the
blue
ridge
mountains
passable
only
at
certain
points
these
as
they
are
called
in
virginia
are
the
natural
doorways
to
the
valley
and
as
long
as
general
mcclellan
held
them
as
he
proposed
to
do
by
strong
detachments
he
would
be
able
both
to
protect
his
own
communications
with
the
potomac
and
if
he
thought
fit
to
do
so
enter
the
valley
and
assail
the
confederate
rear
that
he
ever
seriously
contemplated
the
latter
design
is
however
extremely
doubtful
it
is
not
credible
that
he
would
have
undertaken
to
cut
off
lee
whole
army
and
if
he
designed
a
movement
of
that
description
against
any
portion
of
the
southern
army
which
might
be
detached
the
opportunity
was
certainly
presented
to
him
by
lee
when
jackson
was
left
as
will
be
seen
at
millwood
no
sooner
had
general
mcclellan
commenced
crossing
the
potomac
east
of
the
mountain
than
general
lee
broke
up
his
camp
along
the
opequan
and
moved
to
check
this
new
and
formidable
advance
into
the
heart
of
virginia
it
was
not
known
however
whether
the
whole
of
the
federal
forces
had
crossed
east
of
the
blue
ridge
and
to
guard
against
a
possible
movement
on
his
rear
from
the
direction
of
harper
ferry
as
well
as
on
his
flank
through
the
gaps
of
the
mountain
lee
sent
jackson
corps
to
take
position
on
the
road
from
charlestown
to
berryville
where
he
could
oppose
an
advance
of
the
enemy
from
either
direction
the
rest
of
the
army
then
moved
guardedly
but
rapidly
across
the
mountain
into
culpepper
under
these
circumstances
general
mcclellan
had
an
excellent
opportunity
to
strike
a
heavy
blow
at
jackson
who
seemed
to
invite
that
movement
by
crossing
soon
afterward
in
accordance
with
directions
from
lee
one
of
his
divisions
to
the
east
side
of
the
mountain
on
the
federal
rear
that
general
mcclellan
did
not
strike
is
not
creditable
to
him
as
a
commander
the
confederate
army
was
certainly
divided
in
a
very
tempting
manner
longstreet
was
in
culpepper
on
the
of
november
the
day
after
general
had
passed
the
potomac
and
nothing
would
seem
to
have
been
easier
than
to
cut
the
confederate
forces
by
interposing
between
them
by
seizing
the
blue
ridge
gaps
and
thus
shutting
up
all
the
avenues
of
exit
from
the
valley
general
mcclellan
would
have
had
it
in
his
power
it
would
seem
to
crush
jackson
or
if
that
wily
commander
escaped
longstreet
in
culpepper
was
exposed
to
attack
general
mcclellan
did
not
embrace
this
opportunity
of
a
decisive
blow
and
lee
seems
to
have
calculated
upon
the
caution
of
his
adversary
presence
in
the
valley
only
embarrassed
mcclellan
as
lee
no
doubt
intended
it
should
no
attempt
was
made
to
strike
at
him
on
the
contrary
the
federal
army
continued
steadily
to
concentrate
upon
warrenton
where
on
the
of
november
general
mcclellan
was
abruptly
relieved
of
the
command
he
was
in
his
tent
at
rectortown
at
the
moment
when
the
dispatch
was
handed
to
him
brought
by
an
officer
from
washington
through
a
heavy
then
falling
general
ambrose
burnside
was
in
the
tent
mcclellan
read
the
dispatch
calmly
and
handing
it
indifferently
to
his
visitor
said
well
burnside
you
are
to
command
the
army
such
was
the
abrupt
termination
of
the
military
career
of
a
commander
who
fills
a
large
space
in
the
history
of
the
war
in
virginia
the
design
of
this
volume
is
not
such
as
to
justify
an
extended
notice
of
him
or
a
detailed
examination
of
his
abilities
as
a
soldier
that
he
possessed
military
endowments
of
a
very
high
order
is
conceded
by
most
persons
but
his
critics
add
that
he
was
dangerously
prone
to
caution
and
inactivity
such
was
the
criticism
of
his
enemies
at
washington
and
throughout
the
north
and
his
pronounced
political
opinions
had
gained
him
a
large
number
it
may
however
be
permitted
one
who
can
have
no
reason
to
unduly
commend
him
to
say
that
the
retreat
to
james
river
and
the
arrest
of
lee
in
his
march
of
invasion
toward
pennsylvania
seem
to
indicate
the
possession
of
something
more
than
inactivity
and
of
that
species
of
caution
which
achieves
success
it
will
probably
however
be
claimed
by
few
even
among
the
personal
friends
of
this
general
that
he
was
a
soldier
of
the
first
ability
one
competent
to
oppose
lee
as
to
the
personal
qualities
of
general
mcclellan
there
seems
to
be
no
difference
of
opinion
he
was
a
gentleman
of
high
breeding
and
detested
all
oppression
of
the
weak
and
somewhat
prone
to
in
presence
of
the
importunities
of
the
executive
and
other
civilians
unskilled
in
military
affairs
he
was
patient
mild
and
cordial
with
his
men
these
qualities
with
others
which
he
possessed
seem
to
have
rendered
him
peculiarly
acceptable
to
the
private
soldier
and
it
is
certain
that
he
was
beyond
comparison
the
most
popular
of
all
the
generals
who
one
after
another
commanded
the
army
of
the
potomac
ix
lee
concentrates
at
fredericksburg
in
returning
from
the
valley
general
lee
had
exhibited
that
combination
of
boldness
and
caution
which
indicates
in
a
commander
the
possession
of
excellent
generalship
one
of
two
courses
was
necessary
either
to
make
a
rapid
march
with
his
entire
army
in
order
to
interpose
himself
between
general
mcclellan
and
what
seemed
to
be
his
objective
point
gordonsville
or
to
so
manoeuvre
his
forces
as
to
retard
and
embarrass
his
adversary
of
these
lee
chose
the
latter
course
exposing
himself
to
what
seemed
very
great
danger
jackson
was
left
in
the
valley
and
longstreet
sent
to
culpepper
under
these
circumstances
general
mcclellan
might
have
cut
off
one
of
the
two
detached
bodies
but
lee
seems
to
have
read
the
character
of
his
adversary
accurately
and
to
have
felt
that
a
movement
of
such
boldness
would
not
probably
be
undertaken
by
him
provision
had
nevertheless
been
made
for
this
possible
contingency
jackson
was
directed
by
lee
in
case
of
an
attack
by
general
mcclellan
to
retire
by
way
of
strasburg
up
the
valley
and
so
rejoin
the
main
body
that
this
movement
would
become
necessary
however
was
not
as
we
have
said
contemplated
it
was
not
supposed
by
lee
that
his
adversary
would
adopt
the
bold
plan
of
crossing
the
blue
ridge
to
assail
jackson
thus
to
leave
that
commander
in
the
valley
instead
of
being
a
military
blunder
was
a
stroke
of
generalship
a
source
of
embarrassment
to
general
mcclellan
and
a
standing
threat
against
the
federal
communications
calculated
to
clog
the
movements
of
their
army
that
lee
aimed
at
this
is
obvious
from
his
order
to
jackson
to
cross
a
division
to
the
eastern
side
of
the
blue
ridge
in
general
mcclellan
rear
when
this
was
done
the
federal
commander
abandoned
if
he
had
ever
resolved
upon
the
design
of
striking
in
between
the
confederate
detachments
as
is
claimed
by
his
admirers
to
have
been
his
determination
gave
up
all
idea
of
moving
into
the
valley
and
endeavoring
to
gain
their
rear
and
from
that
moment
directed
his
whole
attention
to
the
concentration
of
his
army
near
warrenton
with
the
obvious
view
of
establishing
a
new
base
and
operating
southward
on
the
line
of
the
orange
and
alexandria
railroad
lee
object
in
these
manoeuvres
besides
the
general
one
of
embarrassing
his
adversary
seems
to
have
been
to
gain
time
and
thus
to
render
impossible
from
the
lateness
of
the
season
a
federal
advance
upon
richmond
had
general
mcclellan
remained
in
command
it
is
probable
that
this
object
would
have
been
attained
and
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
would
not
have
taken
place
the
two
armies
would
have
lain
opposite
each
other
in
culpepper
and
fauquier
respectively
with
the
upper
rappahannock
between
them
throughout
the
winter
and
the
confederate
forces
weary
and
worn
by
the
long
marches
and
hard
combats
of
would
have
had
the
opportunity
to
rest
and
recover
their
energies
for
the
coming
spring
the
change
of
commanders
defeated
these
views
if
they
were
entertained
by
general
lee
on
assuming
command
general
burnside
conceived
the
project
in
spite
of
the
near
approach
of
winter
of
crossing
the
rappahannock
at
fredericksburg
and
marching
on
richmond
this
he
now
proceeded
to
attempt
by
steadily
moving
from
warrenton
toward
the
lower
rappahannock
and
the
result
as
will
be
seen
was
a
federal
disaster
to
wind
up
this
year
of
battles
we
have
spoken
with
some
particularity
of
the
character
and
military
abilities
of
general
mcclellan
the
first
able
commander
of
the
federal
forces
in
virginia
of
general
burnside
who
appears
but
once
and
for
a
brief
space
only
on
that
great
theatre
it
will
be
necessary
to
say
only
a
few
words
a
modest
and
honorable
soldier
cherishing
for
general
mcclellan
a
cordial
friendship
he
was
unwilling
to
supersede
that
commander
both
from
personal
regard
and
distrust
of
his
own
abilities
he
had
not
sought
the
position
which
had
rather
been
thrust
upon
him
he
was
surprised
and
shocked
he
said
at
his
assignment
to
the
command
he
did
not
want
it
it
had
been
offered
to
him
twice
before
and
he
did
not
feel
that
he
could
take
it
he
had
told
them
that
he
was
not
competent
to
command
such
an
army
as
this
he
had
said
the
same
over
and
over
again
to
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
war
he
was
however
directed
to
assume
command
accepted
the
responsibility
and
proceeded
to
carry
out
the
unexpected
plan
of
advancing
upon
richmond
by
way
of
fredericksburg
to
cover
this
movement
general
burnside
made
a
heavy
feint
as
though
designing
to
cross
into
culpepper
this
does
not
seem
to
have
deceived
lee
who
on
the
of
november
knew
that
his
adversary
was
moving
no
sooner
had
the
fact
been
discovered
that
general
burnside
was
making
for
fredericksburg
than
the
confederate
commander
by
a
corresponding
movement
passed
the
rapidan
and
hastened
in
the
same
direction
as
early
as
the
two
divisions
of
infantry
with
cavalry
and
artillery
were
in
motion
on
the
morning
of
the
longstreet
corps
was
sent
in
the
same
direction
and
when
on
november
general
burnside
arrived
with
his
army
the
federal
forces
drawn
up
on
the
hills
north
of
fredericksburg
saw
on
the
highlands
south
of
the
city
the
red
flags
and
gray
lines
of
their
old
adversaries
as
general
jackson
had
been
promptly
directed
to
join
the
main
body
and
was
already
moving
to
do
so
lee
would
soon
be
able
to
oppose
general
burnside
with
his
whole
force
such
were
the
movements
of
the
opposing
armies
which
brought
them
face
to
face
at
fredericksburg
lee
had
acted
promptly
and
it
would
seem
with
good
judgment
but
the
question
has
been
asked
why
he
did
not
repeat
against
general
burnside
the
strategic
movement
which
had
embarrassed
general
mcclellan
and
arrest
the
march
upon
fredericksburg
by
threatening
with
the
detachment
under
jackson
the
federal
rear
the
reasons
for
not
adopting
this
course
will
be
perceived
by
a
glance
at
the
map
general
burnside
was
taking
up
a
new
base
aquia
creek
on
the
potomac
and
from
the
character
of
the
country
it
was
wholly
impossible
for
lee
to
prevent
him
from
doing
so
he
had
only
to
fall
back
before
jackson
or
any
force
moving
against
his
flank
or
rear
the
potomac
was
at
hand
and
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
lee
to
further
annoy
him
the
latter
accordingly
abandoned
all
thought
of
repeating
his
old
manoeuvre
moved
longstreet
and
the
other
troops
in
culpepper
toward
fredericksburg
and
directing
jackson
to
join
him
there
thus
concentrated
his
forces
directly
in
the
federal
front
with
the
view
of
fighting
a
pitched
battle
army
against
army
this
detailed
account
of
lee
movements
may
appear
tedious
to
some
readers
but
it
was
rather
in
grand
tactics
than
in
fighting
battles
that
he
displayed
his
highest
abilities
as
a
soldier
he
uniformly
adopted
the
broadest
and
most
judicious
plan
to
bring
on
battle
and
personally
directed
as
far
as
was
possible
every
detail
of
his
movements
when
the
hour
came
it
may
be
said
of
him
that
he
felt
he
had
done
his
best
the
actual
fighting
was
left
largely
in
the
hands
of
his
corps
commanders
the
feints
and
slight
encounters
preceding
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
are
not
of
much
interest
or
importance
general
burnside
sent
a
force
to
port
royal
about
miles
below
the
city
but
lee
promptly
detached
a
portion
of
his
army
to
meet
it
if
it
attempted
to
cross
and
that
project
was
abandoned
no
attempt
was
made
by
general
burnside
to
cross
above
and
it
became
obvious
that
he
must
pass
the
river
in
face
of
lee
or
not
at
all
such
was
the
condition
of
affairs
at
fredericksburg
in
the
first
days
of
december
x
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
to
a
correct
understanding
of
the
interesting
battle
of
fredericksburg
a
brief
description
of
the
ground
is
essential
the
city
lies
on
the
south
bank
of
the
rappahannock
which
here
makes
a
considerable
bend
nearly
southward
and
along
the
northern
bank
opposite
extends
a
range
of
hills
which
command
the
city
and
the
level
ground
around
it
south
of
the
river
the
land
is
low
but
from
the
depth
of
the
channel
forms
a
line
of
bluffs

good
shelter

troops

force

only
good

such

on

a
range
of
hills
hemming

the

this
range
begins
near
the
western
suburbs
of
the
city
where
it
is
called
marye
hill
and
sweeps
round
to
the
southward
gradually
receding
from
the
stream
until
at
hamilton
crossing
on
the
richmond
and
potomac
railroad
a
mile
or
more
from
the
river
it
suddenly
subsides
into
the
plain
this
plain
extends
to
the
right
and
is
bounded
by
the
deep
and

has
never
heard
or
read
that
he
received
reënforcements
of
any
description
the
number
fifty
thousand
thus
seems
to
have
been
the
full
amount
of
the
army
that
of
general
burnside
forces
seems
to
have
been
considerably
larger
the
federal
army
consisted
of
the
first
second
third
fifth
sixth
ninth
and
eleventh
corps
the
latter
a
corps
of
reserve
and
large
if
these
had
been
recruited
to
the
full
number
reported
by
general
mcclellan
at
sharpsburg
and
the
additional
troops
fifth
and
eleventh
corps
be
estimated
the
federal
army
must
have
exceeded
one
hundred
thousand
men
this
estimate
is
borne
out
by
federal
authorities
general
franklin
says
a
northern
writer
had
now
with
him
about
the
whole
army
and
general
meade
says
that
franklin
force
amounted
to
from
thousand
to
sixty
thousand
men
which
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
whole
army
numbered
from
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
a
strong
position
was
obviously
essential
to
render
it
possible
for
the
southern
army
of
about
fifty
thousand
men
to
successfully
oppose
the
advance
of
this
force
of
above
one
hundred
thousand
lee
had
found
this
position
and
constructed
earthworks
for
artillery
with
the
view
of
receiving
the
attack
of
the
enemy
after
their
crossing
he
was
unable
to
obstruct
this
crossing
in
any
material
degree
and
he
states
clearly
the
grounds
of
this
inability
the
plain
of
fredericksburg
he
says
is
so
completely
commanded
by
the
stafford
heights
that
no
effectual
opposition
could
be
made
to
the
construction
of
bridges
or
the
passage
of
the
river
without
exposing
our
troops
to
the
destructive
fire
of
the
numerous
batteries
of
the
enemy
our
position
was
therefore
selected
with
a
view
to
resist
the
advance
after
crossing
and
the
river
was
guarded
only
by
a
force
sufficient
to
impede
his
movements
until
the
army
could
be
concentrated
the
brief
description
we
have
presented
of
the
character
of
the
ground
around
fredericksburg
and
the
position
of
the
adversaries
will
sufficiently
indicate
the
conditions
under
which
the
battle
was
fought
both
armies
seem
to
have
been
in
excellent
spirits
that
of
general
burnside
had
made
a
successful
march
during
which
they
had
scarcely
seen
an
enemy
and
now
looked
forward
probably
to
certain
if
not
easy
victory
general
lee
army
in
like
manner
had
undergone
recently
no
peculiar
hardships
in
marching
or
fighting
and
to
whatever
cause
the
fact
may
be
attributed
was
in
a
condition
of
the
highest
efficiency
the
men
seemed
to
be
confident
of
the
result
of
the
coming
conflict
and
in
their
bivouacs
on
the
line
of
battle
in
the
woods
fringing
the
ridge
which
they
occupied
laughed
jested
cheered
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
instead
of
shrinking
from
looked
forward
with
eagerness
to
the
moment
when
general
burnside
would
advance
to
attack
them
this
buoyant
and
elastic
spirit
in
the
southern
troops
was
observable
on
the
eve
of
nearly
every
battle
of
the
war
whether
it
was
due
to
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
race
or
to
other
causes
we
shall
not
pause
here
to
inquire
but
the
fact
was
plain
to
the
most
casual
observation
and
was
never
more
striking
than
just
before
fredericksburg
unless
just
preceding
the
battle
of
gettysburg
nothing
of
any
importance
occurred
from
the
of
november
when
general
burnside
army
was
concentrated
on
the
heights
north
of
fredericksburg
until
the
of
december
when
the
federal
army
began
crossing
the
rappahannock
to
deliver
battle
lee
reasons
for
not
attempting
to
resist
the
passage
of
the
river
have
been
given
above
the
plain
on
which
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
draw
up
his
army
in
order
to
do
so
was
too
much
exposed
to
the
numerous
artillery
of
the
enemy
on
the
northern
bank
lee
resolved
therefore
not
to
oppose
the
crossing
of
the
federal
troops
but
to
await
their
assault
on
the
commanding
ground
west
and
south
of
the
city
on
the
morning
of
december
before
dawn
the
dull
boom
of
indicated
that
the
enemy
were
moving
and
the
southern
troops
formed
line
of
battle
to
meet
the
coming
attack
general
burnside
had
made
arrangements
to
cross
the
river
on
pontoon
bridges
one
opposite
the
city
and
another
a
mile
or
two
lower
down
the
stream
general
franklin
commanding
the
two
corps
of
the
left
grand
division
succeeded
without
trouble
in
laying
the
lower
bridge
as
the
ground
did
not
permit
lee
to
offer
material
obstruction
and
this
large
portion
of
the
army
was
now
ready
to
cross
the
passage
of
the
stream
at
fredericksburg
was
more
difficult
although
determined
not
to
make
a
serious
effort
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
crossing
general
lee
had
placed
two
regiments
of
barksdale
mississippians
along
the
bank
of
the
river
in
the
city
to
act
as
and
impede
the
construction
of
the
pontoon
bridges
with
the
view
doubtless
of
thus
giving
time
to
marshal
his
troops
the
success
of
this
device
was
considerable
the
workmen
busily
engaged
in
laying
the
federal
pontoons
were
so
much
interrupted
by
the
fire
of
the
confederate
marksmen
who
directed
their
aim
through
the
heavy
fog
by
the
noise
made
in
putting
together
the
boats
that
after
losing
a
number
of
men
the
federal
commander
discontinued
his
attempt
it
was
renewed
again
and
again
without
success
as
before
when
provoked
apparently
by
the
presence
of
this
hornet
nest
which
reversed
all
his
plans
general
burnside
about
ten
opened
a
furious
fire
of
artillery
upon
the
city
the
extent
of
this
bombardment
will
be
understood
from
the
statement
that
one
hundred
and
pieces
of
artillery
were
employed
which
fired
seven
thousand
three
hundred
and
fifty
rounds
of
ammunition
in
one
instance
piercing
a
single
small
house
with
fifty
an
of
this
scene
says
the
enemy
had
planted
more
than
a
hundred
pieces
of
artillery
on
the
hills
to
the
northern
and
eastern
sides
of
the
town
and
from
an
early
hour
in
the
forenoon
swept
the
streets
with
shell
and
firing
frequently
a
hundred
guns
a
minute
the
quick
puffs
of
smoke
touched
in
the
centre
with
tongues
of
flame
ran
incessantly
along
the
lines
of
their
batteries
on
the
slopes
and
as
the
smoke
slowly
drifted
away
the
bellowing
roar
came
up
in
one
continuous
roll
the
town
was
soon
fired
and
a
dense
cloud
of
smoke
enveloped
its
roofs
and
steeples
the
white
still
rose
serenely
aloft
defying
shot
or
shell
though
a
portion
of
one
of
them
was
torn
off
the
smoke
was
succeeded
by
lurid
flame
and
the
crimson
mass
brought
to
mind
the
pictures
of
moscow
burning
the
same
writer
says
men
women
and
children
were
driven
from
the
town
and
hundreds
of
ladies
and
children
were
seen
wandering
homeless
and
without
shelter
over
the
frozen
highway
in
thin
clothing
knowing
not
where
to
find
a
place
of
refuge
illustration
fredericksburg
general
lee
watched
this
painful
spectacle
from
a
redoubt
to
the
right
of
the
telegraph
road
not
far
from
his
centre
where
a
shoulder
jutting
out
from
the
ridge
and
now
called
lee
hill
afforded
him
a
clear
view
of
the
city
the
destruction
of
the
place
and
the
suffering
of
the
inhabitants
aroused
in
him
a
deep
melancholy
mingled
with
exasperation
and
his
comment
on
the
scene
was
probably
as
bitter
as
any
speech
which
he
uttered
during
the
whole
war
standing
wrapped
in
his
cape
with
only
a
few
officers
near
he
looked
fixedly
at
the
flames
rising
from
the
city
and
after
remaining
for
a
long
time
silent
said
in
his
grave
deep
voice
these
people
delight
to
destroy
the
weak
and
those
who
can
make
no
defence
it
just
suits
them
general
burnside
continued
the
bombardment
for
some
hours
the
mississippians
still
holding
the
and
preventing
the
laying
of
the
pontoons
which
was
again
begun
and
again
discontinued
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
however
a
force
was
sent
across
in
barges
and
by
nightfall
the
city
was
evacuated
by
lee
and
general
burnside
proceeded
rapidly
to
lay
his
pontoon
bridge
upon
which
his
army
then
began
to
pass
over
the
crossing
continued
throughout
the
next
day
not
materially
obstructed
by
the
fire
of
lee
artillery
as
a
dense
fog
rendered
the
aim
of
the
cannoneers
unreliable
by
nightfall
of
the
the
federal
army
was
over
with
the
exception
of
general
hooker
centre
grand
division
which
was
held
in
reserve
on
the
north
bank
general
burnside
then
proceeded
to
form
his
line
of
battle
it
stretched
from
the
western
suburbs
of
fredericksburg
down
the
river
along
what
is
called
the
river
road
for
a
distance
of
about
four
miles
and
consisted
of
the
right
grand
division
under
general
sumner
at
the
city
and
the
left
grand
division
under
general
franklin
lower
down
and
opposite
lee
right
general
franklin
grand
division
numbered
according
to
general
meade
from
to
sixty
thousand
men
the
numbers
of
generals
sumner
and
hooker
are
not
known
to
the
present
writer
but
are
said
by
federal
authorities
as
we
have
stated
to
have
amounted
together
to
about
the
same
at
daybreak
on
the
morning
of
december
a
muffled
sound
issuing
from
the
dense
fog
covering
the
low
ground
indicated
that
the
federal
lines
were
preparing
to
advance
to
enable
the
reader
to
understand
general
burnside
plan
of
attack
it
is
necessary
that
brief
extracts
should
be
presented
from
his
orders
on
the
occasion
and
from
his
subsequent
testimony
before
the
committee
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
despite
the
length
of
time
since
his
arrival
at
fredericksburg
a
period
of
more
than
three
weeks
the
federal
commander
had
it
appears
been
unable
to
obtain
full
and
accurate
information
of
the
character
of
the
ground
occupied
by
lee
and
thus
moved
very
much
in
the
dark
he
seems
to
have
formed
his
plan
of
attack
in
consequence
of
information
from
a
colored
man
his
words
are
the
enemy
had
cut
a
road
along
in
the
rear
of
the
line
of
heights
where
we
made
our
attack
i
obtained
from
a
colored
man
at
the
other
side
of
the
town
information
in
regard
to
this
new
road
which
proved
to
be
correct
i
wanted
to
obtain
possession
of
that
new
road
and
that
was
my
reason
for
making
an
attack
on
the
extreme
left
it
is
difficult
for
those
familiar
with
the
ground
referred
to
to
understand
how
this
new
road
a
mere
country
as
it
were
extending
along
in
the
rear
of
lee
right
wing
could
have
been
regarded
as
a
topographical
feature
of
any
importance
the
road
which
remains
unchanged
and
may
be
seen
by
any
one
was
insignificant
in
a
military
point
of
view
and
in
attaching
such
importance
to
seizing
it
the
federal
commander
committed
a
grave
error
what
seems
to
have
been
really
judicious
in
his
plan
was
the
turning
movement
determined
on
against
lee
right
along
the
old
richmond
road
running
from
the
direction
of
the
river
past
the
end
of
the
ridge
occupied
by
the
confederates
and
so
southward
to
break
through
at
this
point
was
the
only
hope
of
success
and
general
burnside
had
accordingly
resolved
he
declared
upon
a
rapid
movement
down
the
old
richmond
road
with
franklin
large
command
unfortunately
however
this
wise
design
was
complicated
with
another
most
unwise
to
send
forward
first
to
seize
the
crest
of
the
ridge
near
the
point
where
it
sinks
into
the
plain
on
this
crest
were
posted
the
veterans
of
jackson
commanded
in
person
by
that
skilful
soldier
three
lines
of
infantry
supported
by
artillery
were
ready
to
receive
the
federal
attack
and
to
force
back
this
stubborn
obstacle
general
burnside
sent
a
division
the
proof
is
found
in
his
order
to
general
franklin
at
about
six
on
the
morning
of
the
battle
send
out
a
division
at
least
to
seize
if
possible
the
heights
near
captain
hamilton
which
was
the
ground
whereon
jackson
right
rested
an
attack
on
the
formidable
position
known
as
marye
hill
on
left
west
of
fredericksburg
was
also
directed
to
be
made
by
the
same
small
force
the
order
to
general
sumner
was
to
form
a
column
of
for
the
purpose
of
pushing
in
the
direction
of
the
telegraph
and
plank
roads
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
the
heights
in
the
rear
of
the
town
or
according
to
another
version
up
the
plank
road
to
its
intersection
with
the
telegraph
road
where
they
will
divide
with
the
object
of
seizing
the
heights
on
both
sides
of
those
roads
the
point
of
intersection
here
referred
to
was
the
locality
of
what
has
been
called
that
sombre
fatal
terrible
stone
wall
just
under
marye
hill
where
the
most
fearful
slaughter
of
the
federal
forces
took
place
marye
hill
is
a
strong
position
and
its
importance
was
well
understood
by
lee
longstreet
infantry
was
in
heavy
line
of
battle
behind
it
and
the
crest
bristled
with
artillery
there
was
still
less
hope
here
of
effecting
any
thing
with
a
division
than
on
the
confederate
right
held
by
jackson
general
burnside
seems
however
to
have
regarded
success
as
probable
he
added
in
his
order
holding
these
heights
with
the
heights
near
captain
hamilton
will
i
hope
compel
the
enemy
to
evacuate
the
whole
ridge
between
these
points
in
his
testimony
afterward
he
said
that
in
the
event
of
failure
in
these
assaults
on
lee
flanks
he
proposed
to
make
a
direct
attack
on
their
front
and
drive
them
out
of
their
works
these
extracts
from
general
burnside
orders
and
testimony
clearly
indicate
his
plan
which
was
to
assail
both
lee
right
and
left
and
in
the
event
of
failure
direct
a
heavy
blow
at
his
centre
that
the
whole
plan
completely
failed
was
mainly
due
it
would
seem
to
the
inconsiderable
numbers
of
the
assaulting
columns
we
return
now
to
the
narrative
of
the
battle
which
these
comments
have
interrupted
general
lee
was
ready
to
receive
the
federal
attack
and
at
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
rode
from
his
headquarters
in
rear
of
his
centre
along
his
line
of
battle
toward
the
right
where
he
probably
expected
the
main
assault
of
the
enemy
to
take
place
he
was
clad
in
his
plain
gray
uniform
with
felt
hat
and
short
cape
without
sword
and
almost
without
any
indications
of
his
rank
in
these
outward
details
he
differed
much
from
generals
jackson
and
stuart
who
rode
with
him
the
latter
as
was
usual
with
him
wore
a
uniform
sash
black
plume
sabre
and
handsome
gauntlets
general
jackson
also
on
this
day
chanced
to
have
exchanged
his
dingy
old
coat
and
for
a
new
coat
covered
with
dazzling
buttons
and
a
cap
brilliant
with
a
broad
band
of
gold
lace
in
which
for
him
extraordinary
disguise
his
men
scarcely
knew
him
footnote
this
coat
was
a
present
from
stuart
as
lee
and
his
companions
passed
along
in
front
of
the
line
of
battle
the
troops
cheered
them
it
was
evident
that
the
army
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
ready
for
the
hard
work
which
the
day
would
bring
lee
proceeded
down
the
old
richmond
or
stage
road
that
mentioned
in
general
burnside
order
as
the
one
over
which
his
large
flanking
column
was
to
move
and
rode
on
with
stuart
until
he
was
near
the
river
road
running
toward
fredericksburg
parallel
to
the
federal
line
of
battle
here
he
stopped
and
endeavored
to
make
out
through
the
dense
fog
covering
the
plain
whether
the
federal
forces
were
moving
a
stifled
hum
issued
from
the
mist
but
nothing
could
be
seen
it
seemed
however
that
the
enemy
skirmishers
probably
concealed
in
the
ditches
along
the
river
road
had
sharper
eyes
as
bullets
began
to
whistle
around
the
two
generals
and
soon
a
number
of
black
specks
were
seen
moving
forward
general
lee
remained
for
some
time
longer
in
spite
of
the
exposure
conversing
with
great
calmness
and
gravity
with
stuart
who
was
all
ardor
he
then
rode
back
slowly
passed
along
his
line
of
battle
greeted
wherever
he
was
seen
with
cheers
and
took
his
position
on
the
eminence
in
his
centre
near
the
telegraph
road
the
same
commanding
point
from
which
he
had
witnessed
the
bombardment
of
fredericksburg
the
battle
did
not
commence
until
ten
owing
to
the
dense
fog
through
which
the
light
of
the
sun
could
scarcely
pierce
at
that
hour
the
mist
lifted
and
rolled
away
and
the
confederates
posted
on
the
ridge
saw
a
heavy
column
of
infantry
advancing
to
attack
their
right
near
the
hamilton
house
this
force
was
meade
division
supported
by
gibbon
with
a
third
in
reserve
general
franklin
having
put
in
action
as
many
troops
as
his
orders
a
division
at
least
permitted
general
meade
was
arrested
for
some
time
by
a
minute
but
most
annoying
obstacle
stuart
had
placed
a
single
piece
of
artillery
under
major
john
pelham
near
the
point
where
the
old
richmond
and
river
roads
meet
that
is
directly
on
the
flank
of
the
advancing
column
and
this
gun
now
opened
a
rapid
and
determined
fire
upon
general
meade
major
pelham
almost
a
boy
in
years
continued
to
hold
his
exposed
position
with
great
gallantry
although
the
enemy
opened
fire
upon
him
with
several
batteries
killing
a
number
of
his
gunners
general
lee
witnessed
this
duel
from
the
hill
on
which
he
had
taken
his
stand
and
is
said
to
have
exclaimed
it
is
glorious
to
see
such
courage
in
one
so
young
footnote
general
lee
opinion
of
major
pelham
appears
from
his
report
in
which
he
styles
the
young
officer
the
gallant
pelham
and
says
four
batteries
immediately
turned
upon
him
but
he
sustained
their
heavy
fire
with
the
unflinching
courage
that
ever
distinguished
him
pelham
fell
at
kelly
ford
in
march
pelham
continued
the
cannonade
for
about
two
hours
only
retiring
when
he
received
a
peremptory
order
from
jackson
to
do
so
and
it
would
seem
that
this
one
gun
caused
a
considerable
delay
in
the
attack
meade
advanced
across
the
plain
but
had
not
proceeded
far
says
swinton
before
he
was
compelled
to
stop
and
silence
a
battery
that
stuart
had
posted
on
the
port
royal
road
having
brushed
away
this
annoying
obstacle
general
meade
with
a
force
which
he
states
to
have
amounted
to
ten
thousand
men
advanced
rapidly
to
attack
the
hill
upon
which
the
confederates
awaited
him
he
was
suffered
to
approach
within
a
few
hundred
yards
when
jackson
artillery
under
colonel
walker
posted
near
the
end
of
the
ridge
opened
a
sudden
and
furious
fire
which
threw
the
federal
line
into
temporary
confusion
the
troops
soon
rallied
however
and
advanced
again
to
the
attack
which
fell
on
jackson
front
line
under
hill
the
struggle
which
now
ensued
was
fierce
and
bloody
but
a
gap
having
been
left
between
the
brigades
of
archer
and
lane
the
enemy
pierced
the
opening
turning
the
left
of
one
brigade
and
the
right
of
the
other
pressed
on
attacked
gregg
brigade
of
hill
reserve
threw
it
into
confusion
and
seemed
about
to
carry
the
crest
gregg
brigade
was
quickly
rallied
however
by
its
brave
commander
who
soon
afterward
fell
mortally
wounded
the
further
progress
of
the
enemy
was
checked
and
jackson
second
line
rapidly
advancing
the
enemy
were
met
and
forced
back
step
by
step
until
they
were
driven
down
the
slope
again
here
they
were
attacked
by
the
brigades
of
hoke
and
atkinson
and
driven
beyond
the
railroad
the
confederates
cheering
and
following
them
into
the
plain
the
repulse
had
been
complete
and
the
slope
and
ground
in
front
of
it
were
strewed
with
federal
dead
they
had
returned
as
rapidly
as
they
had
charged
pursued
by
shot
and
shell
and
general
lee
witnessing
the
spectacle
from
his
hill
murmured
in
his
grave
and
measured
voice
it
is
well
this
is
so
terrible
we
should
grow
too
fond
of
it
the
assault
on
the
confederate
right
had
thus
ended
in
disaster
but
almost
immediately
another
attack
took
place
whose
results
were
more
bloody
and
terrible
still
as
general
meade
fell
back
pursued
by
the
men
of
jackson
the
sudden
roar
of
artillery
from
the
confederate
left
indicated
that
a
heavy
conflict
had
begun
in
that
quarter
the
federal
troops
were
charging
marye
hill
which
was
to
prove
the
cemetery
hill
of
fredericksburg
this
frightful
charge
for
no
other
adjective
can
describe
it
was
made
by
general
french
division
supported
by
general
hancock
the
federal
troops
rushed
forward
over
the
broken
ground
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
and
as
soon
as
the
masses
became
dense
enough
were
received
with
a
concentrated
artillery
fire
from
the
hill
in
front
of
them
this
fire
was
so
destructive
that
it
made
gaps
that
could
be
seen
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
the
charging
division
had
advanced
in
column
of
brigades
and
the
front
was
nearly
destroyed
the
troops
continued
to
move
forward
however
and
had
nearly
reached
the
base
of
the
hill
when
the
brigades
of
cobb
and
cooke
posted
behind
a
stone
wall
running
parallel
with
the
telegraph
road
met
them
with
a
sudden
fire
of
musketry
which
drove
them
back
in
terrible
disorder
nearly
half
the
force
was
killed
or
lay
disabled
on
the
field
and
upon
the
survivors
now
in
full
retreat
was
directed
a
concentrated

the
hill

longstreet
in
face
of
this
discharge
of
cannon
general
hancock
force
supporting
french
now
gallantly
advanced
in
its
turn
the
charge
lasted
about
fifteen
minutes
and
in
that
time
general
hancock
lost
more
than
two
thousand
of
the
five
thousand
men
of
his
command
the
repulse
was
still
more
bloody
and
decisive
than
the
first
the
second
column
fell
back
in
disorder
leaving
the
ground
covered
with
their
dead
general
burnside
had
hitherto
remained
at
the
phillips
house
a
mile
or
more
from
the
rappahannock
he
now
mounted
his
horse
and
riding
down
to
the
river
dismounted
walked
up
and
down
in
great
agitation
and
exclaimed
looking
at
marye
hill
that
crest
must
be
carried
footnote
the
authority
for
this
incident
is
william
swinton
who
was
present
in
spite
of
the
murderous
results
of
the
first
charges
the
federal
commander
determined
on
a
third
general
hooker
reserve
was
ordered
to
make
it
and
although
that
officer
protested
against
it
general
burnside
was
immovable
and
repeated
his
order
general
hooker
sullenly
obeyed
and
opened
with
artillery
upon
the
stone
wall
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
in
order
to
make
a
breach
in
it
this
fire
continued
until
nearly
sunset
when
humphrey
division
was
formed
for
the
charge
the
men
were
ordered
to
throw
aside
their
knapsacks
and
not
to
load
their
guns
for
there
was
no
time
there
to
load
and
fire
says
general
hooker
the
word
was
given
about
sunset
and
the
division
charged
headlong
over
the
ground
already
covered
with
dead
a
few
words
will
convey
the
result
of
four
thousand
men
who
charged
seventeen
hundred
and
sixty
were
left
dead
or
wounded
on
the
field
the
rest
retreated
pursued
by
the
fire
of
the
batteries
and
infantry
and
night
fell
on
the
this
charge
was
the
real
termination
of
the
bloody
battle
of
fredericksburg
but
on
the
confederate
right
jackson
had
planned
and
begun
to
execute
a
decisive
advance
on
the
force
in
his
front
this
he
designed
to
undertake
precisely
at
sunset
and
his
intention
was
to
depend
on
the
bayonet
his
military
judgment
or
instinct
having
satisfied
him
that
the
of
the
federal
army
was
destroyed
the
advance
was
discontinued
however
in
consequence
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
the
sudden
which
saluted
him
as
he
began
to
move
a
striking
feature
of
this
intended
advance
is
the
fact
that
jackson
had
placed
his
artillery
of
his
line
of
battle
intending
to
attack
in
that
manner
as
darkness
settled
down
the
last
guns
of
stuart
who
had
defended
the
confederate
right
flank
with
about
thirty
pieces
of
artillery
were
heard
far
in
advance
and
apparently
advancing
still
the
federal
lines
had
fallen
back
wellnigh
to
the
banks
of
the
river
and
there
seems
little
room
to
doubt
that
the
of
the
men
was
seriously
impaired
from
what
i
knew
of
our
want
of
success
upon
the
right
says
general
franklin
when
interrogated
on
this
point
and
the
demoralized
condition
of
the
troops
upon
the
right
and
centre
as
represented
to
me
by
their
commanders
i
confess
i
believe
the
order
to
recross
was
a
very
proper
one
general
burnside
refused
to
give
the
order
and
nearly
overwhelmed
apparently
by
the
fatal
result
of
the
attack
determined
to
form
the
ninth
corps
in
column
of
regiments
and
lead
it
in
person
against
marye
hill
on
the
next
morning
such
a
design
in
a
soldier
of
ability
indicates
desperation
to
charge
marye
hill
with
a
corps
in
column
of
regiments
was
to
devote
the
force
to
destruction
it
was
nearly
certain
that
the
whole
command
would
be
torn
to
pieces
by
the
southern
artillery
but
general
burnside
seems
to
have
regarded
the
possession
of
the
hill
as
worth
any
amount
of
blood
and
in
face
of
the
urgent
appeals
of
his
officers
gave
orders
for
the
movement
at
the
last
moment
however
he
yielded
to
the
entreaties
of
general
sumner
and
abandoned
his
bloody
design
still
it
seemed
that
the
federal
commander
was
unable
to
come
to
the
mortifying
resolution
of
recrossing
the
rappahannock
the
battle
was
fought
on
the
of
december
and
until
the
night
of
the
general
burnside
continued
to
face
lee
on
the
south
bank
of
the
river
his
bands
playing
his
flags
flying
and
nothing
indicating
an
intention
of
retiring
to
that
resolve
he
had
however
come
and
on
the
night
of
the
in
the
midst
of
storm
and
darkness
the
federal
army
recrossed
to
the
north
bank
of
the
rappahannock
xi
final
movements
of
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
was
another
defeat
of
the
federal
programme
of
invasion
as
decisive
and
in
one
sense
as
disastrous
as
the
second
battle
of
manassas
general
burnside
had
not
lost
as
many
men
as
general
pope
and
had
not
retreated
in
confusion
pursued
by
a
victorious
enemy
but
brief
as
the
conflict
had
been
two
or
three
hours
summing
up
all
the
real
fighting
its
desperate
character
and
the
evident
hopelessness
of
any
attempt
to
storm
lee
position
profoundly
discouraged
and
demoralized
the
northern
troops
we
have
quoted
the
statement
of
general
franklin
commanding
the
whole
left
wing
that
from
the
demoralized
condition
of
the
troops
upon
the
right
and
centre
as
represented
to
him
by
their
commanders
he
believed
the
order
to
recross
was
a
very
proper
one
nor
is
there
any
ground
to
suppose
that
the
feeling
of
the
left
wing
was
greatly
better
that
wing
of
the
army
had
not
suffered
as
heavily
as
the
right
which
had
recoiled
with
such
frightful
slaughter
from
hill
but
the
repulse
of
general
meade
in
their
own
front
had
been
equally
decisive
and
the
of
the
right
must
have
reacted
on
the
left
discouraging
that
also
northern
writers
in
a
position
to
ascertain
the
condition
of
the
troops
fully
bear
out
this
view
that
the
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
became
seriously
impaired
after
the
disaster
at
fredericksburg
says
swinton
the
able
and
candid
historian
of
the
campaign
was
only
too
manifest
indeed
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
a
graver
or
gloomier
a
more
sombre
or
unmusical
body
of
men
than
the
army
of
the
potomac
a
month
after
the
battle
and
as
the
days
went
by
despondency
discontent
and
all
evil
inspirations
with
their
natural
consequent
desertion
seemed
to
increase
rather
than
to
diminish
until
for
the
first
time
the
army
of
the
potomac
could
be
said
to
be
really
demoralized
general
sumner
noticed
that
a
spirit
of
croaking
had
become
diffused
throughout
the
forces
for
an
army
to
display
that
tendency
clearly
indicates
that
the
troops
have
lost
the
most
important
element
of
victory
confidence
in
themselves
and
their
leader
and
for
this
sentiment
there
was
valid
reason
columns
wholly
inadequate
in
numbers
had
been
advanced
against
the
formidable
confederate
positions
positions
so
strong
and
well
defended
that
it
is
doubtful
if
thrice
the
force
could
have
made
any
impression
upon
them
and
the
result
was
such
as
might
have
been
expected
the
men
lost
confidence
in
the
military
capacity
of
their
commander
and
in
their
own
powers
after
the
double
repulse
at
marye
hill
and
in
front
of
jackson
the
troops
looking
at
the
ground
strewed
with
dead
and
wounded
were
in
no
condition
to
go
forward
hopefully
to
another
struggle
which
promised
to
be
equally
bloody
the
southern
army
was
naturally
in
a
condition
strongly
in
contrast
with
that
of
their
adversary
they
had
repulsed
the
determined
assault
of
the
federal
columns
with
comparative
ease
on
both
flanks
first
line
although
pierced
and
driven
back
soon
rallied
and
checked
the
enemy
until
the
second
line
came
up
when
general
meade
was
driven
back
the
third
line
not
having
moved
from
its
position
along
the
road
near
the
hamilton
house
on
the
left
longstreet
had
repulsed
the
federal
charge
with
his
artillery
and
two
small
brigades
the
loss
of
the
confederates
in
both
these
encounters
was
much
less
than
that
of
their
adversaries
a
natural
result
of
the
circumstances
and
thus
instead
of
sharing
the
depression
of
their
opponents
the
southern
troops
were
elated
and
looked
forward
to
a
renewal
of
the
battle
with
confidence
in
themselves
and
in
their
leader
footnote
our
loss
during
the
operation
since
the
movements
of
the
enemy
began
amounts
to
about
eighteen
hundred
killed
and
wounded
federal
authorities
state
the
northern
loss
at
a
little
over
twelve
thousand
the
larger
part
no
doubt
in
the
attack
on
marye
hill
it
is
not
necessary
to
offer
much
comment
upon
the
manner
in
which
general
burnside
had
attacked
he
is
said
by
his
critics
not
to
have
at
the
time
designed
the
turning
movement
against
general
right
upon
which
point
the
present
writer
is
unable
to
decide
that
movement
would
seem
to
have
presented
the
sole
and
only
chance
of
success
for
the
federal
arms
as
the
successful
advance
of
general
franklin
or
sixty
thousand
men
up
the
old
richmond
road
would
have
compelled
lee
to
retire
his
whole
right
wing
to
protect
it
from
an
assault
in
flank
and
reverse
what
dispositions
he
would
have
made
under
these
circumstances
must
be
left
to
conjecture
but
it
is
certain
that
the
blow
would
have
proved
a
serious
one
calling
for
the
display
of
all
his
military
ability
in
the
event
however
that
this
was
the
main
great
aim
of
general
burnside
his
method
of
carrying
out
his
design
insured
it
would
seem
its
failure
ten
thousand
men
only
were
to
clear
the
way
for
the
flanking
movement
in
order
to
effect
which
object
it
was
necessary
to
crush
jackson
so
that
it
may
be
said
that
the
success
of
the
plan
involved
the
repulse
of
army
with
ten
thousand
men
the
assault
on
marye
hill
was
an
equally
fatal
military
mistake
that
the
position
could
not
be
stormed
is
proved
by
the
result
of
the
actual
attempt
it
is
doubtful
if
in
any
battle
ever
fought
by
any
troops
men
displayed
greater
gallantry
they
rushed
headlong
not
only
once
but
thrice
into
the
focus
of
a
frightful
front
and
cross
fire
of
artillery
and
losing
nearly
half
their
numbers
in
a
few
minutes
the
ground
was
littered
with
their
dead
and
yet
the
foremost
had
only
been
able
to
approach
within
sixty
yards
of
the
terrible
stone
wall
in
advance
of
the
hill
there
they
fell
throwing
up
their
hands
to
indicate
that
they
saw
at
last
that
the
attempt
to
carry
the
hill
was
hopeless
these
comments
seem
justified
by
the
circumstances
and
are
made
with
no
intention
of
casting
obloquy
upon
the
commander
who
displaying
little
ability
gave
evidences
of
unfaltering
courage
he
had
urged
his
inability
to
handle
so
large
an
army
but
the
authorities
had
forced
the
command
upon
him
he
had
accepted
it
and
done
his
best
and
like
a
brave
soldier
determined
to
lead
the
final
charge
in
person
dying
if
necessary
at
the
head
of
his
men
general
lee
has
not
escaped
criticism
any
more
than
general
burnside
the
southern
people
were
naturally
dissatisfied
with
the
result
the
safe
retreat
of
the
federal
army
and
asked
why
they
had
not
been
attacked
and
captured
or
destroyed
the
london
at
that
period
and
a
military
critic
recently
in
the
same
journal
declared
that
lee
had
it
in
his
power
to
crush
general
burnside
horse
foot
and
dragoons
and
from
his
failure
to
do
so
argued
his
want
of
great
generalship
a
full
discussion
of
the
question
is
left
by
the
present
writer
to
those
better
skilled
than
himself
in
military
science
it
is
proper
however
to
insert
here
general
lee
own
explanation
of
his
action
the
attack
on
the
he
says
had
been
so
easily
repulsed
and
by
so
small
a
part
of
our
army
that
it
was
not
supposed
the
enemy
would
limit
his
efforts
to
one
attempt
which
in
view
of
the
magnitude
of
his
preparations
and
the
extent
of
his
force
seemed
to
be
comparatively
insignificant
believing
therefore
that
he
would
attack
us
it
was
not
deemed
expedient
to
lose
the
advantages
of
our
position
and
expose
the
troops
to
the
fire
of
his
inaccessible
batteries
beyond
the
river
by
advancing
against
him
but
we
were
necessarily
ignorant
of
the
extent
to
which
he
had
suffered
and
only
became
aware
of
it
when
on
the
morning
of
the
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
availed
himself
of
the
darkness
of
night
and
the
prevalence
of
a
violent
storm
of
wind
and
rain
to
recross
the
river
this
statement
was
no
doubt
framed
by
general
lee
to
meet
the
criticisms
which
the
result
of
the
battle
occasioned
in
conversing
with
general
stuart
on
the
subject
he
added
that
he
felt
too
great
responsibility
for
the
preservation
of
his
troops
to
unnecessarily
hazard
them
no
one
knows
he
said
how
an
army
is
the
word
may
appear
strange
applied
to
the
army
of
northern
virginia
which
had
certainly
vindicated
its
claim
under
many
arduous
trials
to
the
virtues
of
toughness
and
endurance
but
lee
meaning
was
plain
and
his
view
seems
to
have
been
founded
on
good
sense
the
enemy
had
in
all
probably
two
hundred
pieces
of
artillery
a
large
portion
of
which
were
posted
on
the
high
ground
north
of
the
river
had
lee
descended
from
his
ridge
and
advanced
into
the
plain
to
attack
this
large
number
of
guns
would
have
greeted
him
with
a
rapid
and
destructive
fire
which
must
have
inflicted
upon
him
a
loss
as
nearly
heavy
as
he
had
inflicted
upon
general
burnside
at
hill
from
such
a
result
he
naturally
shrunk
it
has
been
seen
that
the
federal
troops
brave
as
they
were
had
been
demoralized
by
such
a
fire
and
lee
was
unwilling
to
expose
his
own
troops
to
similar
slaughter
there
is
little
question
it
seems
that
an
advance
of
the
description
mentioned
would
have
resulted
in
a
conclusive
victory
and
the
probable
surrender
of
the
whole
or
a
large
portion
of
the
federal
army
whether
the
probability
of
such
a
result
was
sufficient
to
compensate
for
the
certain
slaughter
the
reader
will
decide
for
himself
general
lee
did
not
think
so
and
did
not
order
the
advance
he
preferred
awaiting
in
his
strong
position
the
second
assault
which
general
burnside
would
probably
make
and
while
he
thus
waited
the
enemy
secretly
recrossed
the
river
rendering
an
attack
upon
them
by
lee
impossible
general
burnside
made
a
second
movement
to
cross
the
rappahannock
this
time
at
banks
ford
above
fredericksburg
in
the
inclement
month
of
january
but
as
he
might
have
anticipated
the
condition
of
the
roads
was
such
that
it
was
impossible
to
advance
his
artillery
with
the
horses
dragging
the
pieces
sank
into
the
almost
bottomless
mud
where
they
stuck
fast
even
the
found
it
difficult
to
march
through
the
quagmire
and
the
whole
movement
was
speedily
abandoned
when
general
burnside
issued
the
order
for
this
injudicious
advance
two
of
his
general
officers
met
and
one
asked
what
do
you
think
of
it
it
do
seem
to
have
the
was
the
reply
no
the
bell
is
broken
the
other
added
this
incident
which
is
given
on
the
authority
of
a
northern
writer
probably
conveys
a
correct
idea
of
the
feeling
of
both
the
officers
and
men
of
general
burnside
army
the
disastrous
day
of
fredericksburg
had
seriously
injured
the
troops
the
army
of
the
potomac
the
writer
adds
was
sadly
fractured
and
its
tones
had
no
longer
the
clear
inspiring
ring
of
victory
xii
the
year
of
battles
the
stormy
year
had
terminated
thus
in
a
great
confederate
success
in
its
arduous
campaigns
following
each
other
in
rapid
succession
general
lee
had
directed
the
movements
of
the
main
great
army
and
the
result
of
the
year
fighting
was
to
gain
him
that
high
military
reputation
which
his
subsequent
movements
only
consolidated
and
increased
a
rapid
glance
at
the
events
of
the
year
in
their
general
outlines
will
indicate
the
merit
due
the
southern
commander
the
federal
plan
of
invasion
in
the
spring
had
been
extremely
formidable
virginia
was
to
be
pierced
by
no
less
than
four
armies
from
the
northwest
the
shenandoah
valley
the
potomac
and
the
peninsula
the
whole
force
to
converge
upon
richmond
the
heart
of
the
rebellion
of
these
the
army
of
general
mcclellan
was
the
largest
and
most
threatening
it
advanced
with
little
opposition
until
it
reached
the
chickahominy
crossed
and
lay
in
sight
of
richmond
the
great
force
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
was
about
to
make
the
decisive
assault
when
lee
attacked
it
and
the
battle
which
ensued
drove
the
federal
army
to
a
point
thirty
miles
from
the
city
with
such
loss
as
to
render
hopeless
any
further
attempt
to
assail
the
capital
such
was
the
first
act
of
the
drama
the
rest
speedily
followed
a
new
army
was
raised
promptly
by
the
federal
authorities
and
a
formidable
advance
was
made
against
richmond
again
this
time
from
the
direction
of
alexandria
lee
was
watching
general
mcclellan
when
intelligence
of
the
new
movement
reached
him
remaining
with
a
portion
of
his
troops
near
richmond
he
sent
jackson
to
the
rapidan
the
battle
of
cedar
mountain
resulted
in
the
repulse
of
general
pope
vanguard
and
discovering
at
last
that
the
real
danger
lay
in
the
direction
of
culpepper
lee
moved
thither
drove
back
general
pope
flanked
him
and
in
the
severe
battle
of
manassas
routed
his
army
which
was
forced
to
retire
upon
washington
two
armies
had
thus
been
driven
from
the
soil
of
virginia
and
the
confederate
commander
had
moved
into
maryland
in
order
to
draw
the
enemy
thither
and
if
practicable
transfer
the
war
to
the
heart
of
pennsylvania
unforeseen
circumstances
had
defeated
the
latter
of
these
objects
the
concentration
on
sharpsburg
was
rendered
necessary
an
battle
ensued
there
and
not
defeated
but
forced
to
abandon
further
movements
toward
pennsylvania
lee
had
retired
into
virginia
where
he
remained
facing
his
adversary
this
was
the
first
failure
of
lee
up
to
that
point
in
the
campaigns
of
the
year
and
an
attentive
consideration
of
the
circumstances
will
show
that
the
result
was
not
fairly
attributable
to
any
error
which
he
had
committed
events
beyond
his
control
had
shaped
his
action
and
directed
all
his
movements
and
it
will
remain
a
question
whether
the
extrication
of
his
small
force
from
its
difficult
position
did
not
better
prove
lee
generalship
than
the
victory
at
manassas
the
subsequent
operations
of
the
opposing
armies
indicated
clearly
that
the
southern
forces
were
still
in
excellent
fighting
condition
and
the
movements
of
lee
during
the
advance
of
general
mcclellan
toward
warrenton
were
highly
honorable
to
his
military
ability
with
a
force
much
smaller
than
that
of
his
adversary
he
greatly
embarrassed
and
impeded
the
federal
advance
confronted
them
on
the
upper
rappahannock
completely
checking
their
forward
movement
in
that
direction
and
when
they
moved
rapidly
to
fredericksburg
crossed
the
rapidan
promptly
reappearing
in
their
front
on
the
range
of
hills
opposite
that
city
the
battle
which
followed
compensated
for
the
failure
of
the
maryland
campaign
and
the
drawn
battle
of
sharpsburg
general
burnside
had
attacked
and
sustained
decisive
defeat
the
stormy
year
so
filled
with
great
events
and
arduous
encounters
had
thus
wound
up
with
a
pitched
battle
in
which
the
enemy
suffered
a
bloody
repulse
and
the
best
commentary
on
the
decisive
character
of
this
last
struggle
of
the
year
was
the
fault
found
with
general
lee
for
not
destroying
his
adversary
in
less
than
six
months
lee
had
thus
fought
four
great
pitched
battles
all
victories
to
his
arms
with
the
exception
of
sharpsburg
which
was
neither
a
victory
nor
a
defeat
the
result
was
thus
highly
encouraging
to
the
south
and
had
the
army
of
northern
virginia
had
its
ranks
filled
up
as
the
ranks
of
the
northern
armies
were
the
events
of
the
year
would
have
laid
the
foundation
of
assured
success
an
inquiry
into
the
causes
of
failure
in
this
particular
is
not
necessary
to
the
subject
of
the
volume
before
the
reader
it
is
only
necessary
to
state
the
fact
that
the
army
of
northern
virginia
defending
what
all
conceded
to
be
the
territory
on
which
the
decisive
struggle
must
take
place
was
never
sufficiently
numerous
to
follow
up
the
victories
achieved
by
it
at
the
battles
of
the
chickahominy
the
army
numbered
at
most
about
thousand
at
the
second
manassas
about
fifty
thousand
at
sharpsburg
less
than
forty
thousand
and
at
fredericksburg
about
fifty
thousand
in
the
following
year
it
will
be
seen
that
these
latter
numbers
were
at
first
but
little
exceeded
and
as
the
months
passed
on
that
they
dwindled
more
and
more
until
in
april
the
whole
force
in
line
of
battle
at
petersburg
was
scarcely
more
than
thirty
thousand
men
such
had
been
the
number
of
the
troops
under
command
of
lee
in
the
reader
has
been
informed
of
the
number
of
the
federal
force
opposed
to
him
this
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
on
the
chickahominy
of
whom
one
hundred
and
fifteen
thousand
were
effective
about
one
hundred
thousand
it
would
seem
under
general
pope
at
the
second
battle
of
manassas
thousand
actually
engaged
at
the
battle
of
sharpsburg
and
at
fredericksburg
from
one
hundred
and
ten
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
these
numbers
are
stated
on
the
authority
of
federal
officers
or
historians
and
lee
force
on
the
authority
of
his
own
reports
or
of
gentlemen
of
high
character
in
a
situation
to
speak
with
accuracy
of
the
truth
of
the
statements
the
writer
of
these
pages
can
have
no
doubt
and
if
the
fighting
powers
of
the
northern
and
southern
troops
be
estimated
as
equal
the
fair
conclusion
must
be
arrived
at
that
lee
surpassed
his
adversaries
in
generalship
the
result
at
least
of
the
year
fighting
had
been
extremely
encouraging
to
the
south
and
after
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
no
attempts
were
made
to
prosecute
hostilities
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
the
scheme
of
crossing
above
fredericksburg
proved
a
beginning
and
ending
in
a
day
thereafter
all
movements
ceased
and
the
two
armies
awaited
the
return
of
spring
for
further
operations
xiii
lee
in
december
before
passing
to
the
great
campaigns
of
the
spring
and
summer
of
we
propose
to
say
a
few
words
of
general
lee
in
his
private
and
personal
character
and
to
attempt
to
indicate
the
position
which
he
occupied
at
this
time
in
the
eyes
of
the
army
and
the
country
unknown
save
by
reputation
when
he
assumed
command
of
the
forces
in
june
he
had
now
by
the
winter
of
the
same
year
become
one
of
the
personages
in
the
south
neither
the
troops
nor
the
people
had
perhaps
penetrated
the
full
character
of
lee
and
they
seem
to
have
attributed
to
him
more
reserve
and
less
warmth
and
impulse
than
he
possessed
but
it
was
impossible
for
a
human
being
occupying
so
prominent
a
station
before
the
general
eye
to
hide
in
any
material
degree
his
main
great
characteristics
and
these
had
conciliated
for
lee
an
exalted
and
wellnigh
universal
public
regard
he
was
felt
by
all
to
be
an
individual
of
great
dignity
sincerity
and
earnestness
in
the
performance
of
duty
destitute
plainly
of
that
vulgar
ambition
which
seeks
personal
aggrandizement
rather
than
the
general
good
and
dedicated
as
plainly
heart
and
soul
to
the
cause
for
which
he
fought
he
had
won
even
from
those
who
had
denounced
him
for
the
supposed
hesitation
in
his
course
in
april
and
had
afterward
criticised
his
military
operations
the
repute
of
a
truly
great
man
as
well
as
of
a
commander
of
the
first
ability
it
was
felt
by
all
classes
that
the
dignity
of
the
southern
cause
was
adequately
represented
in
the
person
and
character
of
the
commander
of
her
most
important
army
while
others
as
brave
and
patriotic
no
doubt
but
of
different
temperament
had
permitted
themselves
to
become
violent
and
embittered
in
their
private
and
public
utterances
in
reference
to
the
north
lee
had
remained
calm
moderate
and
dignified
under
every
provocation
his
reports
were
without
rhodomontade
or
exaggeration
and
his
tone
uniformly
modest
composed
and
uninflated
after
his
most
decisive
successes
his
pulse
had
remained
calm
he
had
written
of
those
successes
with
the
air
of
one
who
sees
no
especial
merit
in
any
thing
which
he
has
performed
and
so
marked
was
this
tone
of
moderation
and
dignity
that
in
reading
his
official
reports
it
seems
wellnigh
impossible
that
they
could
have
been
written
in
the
hot
atmosphere
of
a
war
which
aroused
the
bitterest
passions
of
the
human
soul
upon
this
point
of
lee
personal
and
official
dignity
it
is
unnecessary
to
dwell
further
as
the
quality
has
long
since
been
conceded
by
every
one
acquainted
with
the
character
of
the
individual
in
the
old
world
and
the
new
it
is
the
trait
perhaps
the
most
prominent
to
the
observer
looking
back
now
upon
the
individual
and
it
was
doubtless
this
august
moderation
dignity
and
apparent
exemption
from
natural
infirmity
which
produced
the
impression
upon
many
persons
that
lee
was
cold
and
unimpressible
we
shall
speak
in
future
at
greater
length
of
his
real
character
than
is
necessary
in
this
place
but
it
may
here
be
said
that
the
fancy
that
he
was
cold
and
unimpressible
was
a
very
great
error
no
man
had
stronger
or
warmer
feelings
or
regarded
the
invasion
of
the
south
with
greater
indignation
than
himself
the
sole
difference
was
that
he
had
his
feelings
under
greater
control
and
permitted
no
temptation
to
overcome
his
sense
of
that
august
dignity
and
composure
becoming
in
the
chief
leader
of
a
great
people
struggling
for
independent
government
the
sentiment
of
the
southern
people
toward
lee
may
be
summed
up
in
the
statement
that
they
regarded
him
in
his
personal
and
private
character
with
an
admiration
which
was
becoming
unbounded
and
reposed
in
him
as
commander
of
the
army
the
most
implicit
confidence
these
expressions
are
strong
but
they
do
not
convey
more
than
the
truth
and
this
confidence
was
never
withdrawn
from
him
it
remained
as
strong
in
his
hours
of
disaster
as
in
his
noontide
of
success
a
few
soured
or
desponding
people
might
lose
heart
indulge
in
croaking
and
denounce
under
their
breath
the
commander
of
the
army
as
responsible
for
failure
when
it
occurred
but
these
fainthearted
people
were
in
a
small
minority
and
had
little
encouragement
in
their
muttered
criticisms
the
southern
people
from
virginia
to
the
utmost
limits
of
the
gulf
states
resolutely
persisted
in
regarding
lee
as
one
of
the
greatest
soldiers
of
history
and
retained
their
confidence
in
him
unimpaired
to
the
end
the
army
had
set
the
example
of
this
implicit
reliance
upon
lee
as
the
chief
leader
and
military
head
of
the
confederacy
the
brave
had
not
taken
his
reputation
on
trust
but
had
seen
him
win
it
fairly
on
some
of
the
fields
of
history
the
heavy
blow
at
general
mcclellan
on
the
chickahominy
had
first
shown
the
troops
that
they
were
under
command
of
a
thorough
soldier
the
rout
of
pope
at
manassas
had
followed
in
the
ensuing
month
at
sharpsburg
with
less
than
forty
thousand
men
lee
had
repulsed
the
attack
of
nearly
ninety
thousand
and
at
fredericksburg
general
burnside
great
force
had
been
driven
back
with
inconsiderable
loss
to
the
southern
army
these
successes
in
the
eyes
of
the
troops
were
the
proofs
of
true
leadership
and
it
did
not
detract
from
popularity
that
on
all
occasions
he
had
carefully
refrained
from
unnecessary
exposure
of
the
troops
especially
at
fredericksburg
where
an
ambitious
commander
would
have
spared
no
amount
of
bloodshed
to
complete
his
glory
by
a
great
victory
such
was
lee
repute
as
army
commander
in
the
eyes
of
men
accustomed
to
close
scrutiny
of
their
leaders
he
was
regarded
as
a
thorough
soldier
at
once
brave
wise
cool
resolute
and
devoted
heart
and
soul
to
the
cause
personally
the
was
also
by
this
time
extremely
popular
he
did
not
mingle
with
the
troops
to
any
great
extent
nor
often
relax
the
air
of
dignity
somewhat
tinged
with
reserve
which
was
natural
with
him
this
reserve
however
never
amounted
to
stiffness
or
official
coolness
on
the
contrary
lee
was
markedly
free
from
the
chill
demeanor
of
the
martinet
and
had
become
greatly
endeared
to
the
men
by
the
unmistakable
evidences
which
he
had
given
them
of
his
honesty
sincerity
and
kindly
feeling
for
them
it
can
not
indeed
be
said
that
he
sustained
the
same
relation
toward
the
troops
as
general
jackson
for
the
latter
illustrious
soldier
the
men
had
a
species
of
familiar
affection
the
result
in
a
great
degree
of
the
informal
and
often
eccentric
demeanor
of
the
individual
there
was
little
or
nothing
in
jackson
to
indicate
that
he
was
an
officer
holding
important
command
he
was
without
reserve
and
exhibited
none
of
that
formal
courtesy
which
characterized
lee
his
manners
on
the
contrary
were
quite
informal
familiar
and
conciliated
in
return
a
familiar
regard
we
repeat
the
word
as
conveying
precisely
the
idea
intended
to
be
expressed
it
indicated
the
difference
between
these
two
great
soldiers
in
their
outward
appearance
lee
retained
about
him
upon
all
occasions
more
or
less
of
the
passing
before
the
troops
on
an
excellent
and
horse
his
figure
erect
and
graceful
in
the
saddle
for
he
was
one
of
the
best
riders
in
the
army
his
demeanor
grave
and
thoughtful
his
whole
bearing
that
of
a
man
intrusted
with
great
responsibilities
and
the
general
care
of
the
whole
army
jackson
personal
appearance
and
air
were
very
different
his
dress
was
generally
dingy
a
faded
tilted
over
his
eyes
causing
him
to
raise
his
chin
into
the
air
his
stirrups
were
apt
to
be
too
short
and
his
knees
were
thus
elevated
ungracefully
and
he
would
amble
along
on
his
rawboned
horse
with
a
singularly
expression
of
countenance
raising
from
time
to
time
his
right
hand
and
slapping
his
knee
this
brief
outline
of
the
two
commanders
will
serve
to
show
the
difference
between
them
personally
and
it
must
be
added
that
jackson
eccentric
bearing
was
the
source
in
some
degree
of
his
popularity
the
men
admired
him
immensely
for
his
great
military
ability
and
his
odd
ways
procured
for
him
that
familiar
liking
to
which
we
have
alluded
it
is
not
intended
however
in
these
observations
to
convey
the
idea
that
general
lee
was
regarded
as
a
stiff
and
unapproachable
personage
of
whom
the
private
soldiers
stood
in
awe
such
a
statement
would
not
express
the
truth
lee
was
perfectly
approachable
and
no
instance
is
upon
record
or
ever
came
to
the
knowledge
of
the
present
writer
in
which
he
repelled
the
approach
of
his
men
or
received
the
humblest
of
them
with
any
thing
but
kindness
he
was
naturally
simple
and
kind
with
great
gentleness
and
patience
and
it
will
not
be
credible
to
any
who
knew
the
man
that
he
ever
made
any
difference
in
his
treatment
of
those
who
approached
him
from
a
consideration
of
their
rank
in
the
army
his
theory
expressed
upon
many
occasions
was
that
the
private
soldiers
men
who
fought
without
the
stimulus
of
rank
emolument
or
individual
renown
were
the
most
meritorious
class
of
the
army
and
that
they
deserved
and
should
receive
the
utmost
respect
and
consideration
this
statement
however
is
doubtless
unnecessary
men
of
lee
pride
and
dignity
never
make
a
difference
in
their
treatment
of
men
because
one
is
humble
and
the
other
of
high
rank
of
such
human
beings
it
may
be
said
that
the
men
of
the
army
had
thus
found
their
commander
all
that
they
could
wish
and
his
increasing
personal
popularity
was
shown
by
the
greater
frequency
with
which
they
now
spoke
of
him
as
marse
robert
old
uncle
robert
and
by
other
familiar
titles
this
tendency
in
troops
is
always
an
indication
of
personal
regard
these
nicknames
had
been
already
showered
upon
jackson
and
general
lee
was
having
his
turn
the
troops
regarded
him
now
more
as
their
than
formerly
having
found
that
his
dignity
was
not
coldness
and
that
he
would
under
no
temptation
indulge
his
personal
convenience
or
fare
better
than
themselves
it
was
said
we
know
not
with
what
truth
that
the
habit
of
northern
generals
in
the
war
was
to
look
assiduously
to
their
individual
comfort
in
selecting
their
quarters
and
to
take
pleasure
in
surrounding
themselves
with
glittering
and
other
indications
of
their
rank
and
the
consideration
which
they
expected
in
these
particulars
lee
differed
extremely
from
his
opponents
and
there
were
no
evidences
whatever
at
his
headquarters
that
he
was
the
or
even
an
officer
of
high
rank
he
uniformly
lived
in
a
tent
in
spite
of
the
urgent
invitations
of
citizens
to
use
their
houses
for
his
headquarters
and
this
refusal
was
the
result
both
of
an
indisposition
to
expose
these
gentlemen
to
annoyance
from
the
enemy
when
he
himself
retired
and
of
a
rooted
objection
to
fare
better
than
his
troops
they
had
tents
only
often
indeed
were
without
even
that
much
covering
and
it
was
repugnant
to
lee
feelings
to
sleep
under
a
good
roof
when
the
troops
were
so
much
exposed
his
headquarters
tent
at
this
time
december
as
before
and
afterward
was
what
is
called
a
not
differing
in
any
particular
from
those
used
by
the
private
soldiers
of
the
army
in
it
was
pitched
in
an
opening
in
the
wood
near
the
narrow
road
leading
to
crossing
with
the
tents
of
the
officers
of
the
staff
grouped
near
and
with
the
exception
of
an
orderly
who
always
waited
to
summon
couriers
to
carry
dispatches
there
was
nothing
in
the
shape
of
a
visible
or
any
indication
that
the
unpretending
group
of
tents
was
the
army
headquarters
within
no
article
of
luxury
was
to
be
seen
a
few
plain
and
indispensable
objects
were
all
which
the
tent
contained
the
covering
of
the
was
an
ordinary
army
blanket
and
his
fare
was
plainer
perhaps
than
that
of
the
majority
of
his
officers
and
men
this
was
the
result
of
an
utter
indifference
in
lee
to
personal
convenience
or
indulgence
citizens
frequently
sent
him
delicacies
boxes
filled
with
turkeys
hams
wine
cordials
and
other
things
peculiarly
tempting
to
one
leading
the
hard
life
of
the
soldier
but
these
were
almost
uniformly
sent
to
the
sick
in
some
neighboring
hospital
lee
principle
in
so
acting
seems
to
have
been
to
set
the
good
example
to
his
officers
of
not
faring
better
than
their
men
but
he
was
undoubtedly
indifferent
naturally
to
luxury
of
all
descriptions
in
his
habits
and
feelings
he
was
not
the
man
of
peace
but
the
thorough
soldier
willing
to
live
hard
to
sleep
upon
the
ground
and
to
disregard
all
sensual
indulgence
in
his
other
habits
he
was
equally
abstinent
he
cared
nothing
for
wine
whiskey
or
any
stimulant
and
never
used
tobacco
in
any
form
he
rarely
relaxed
his
energies
in
any
thing
calculated
to
amuse
him
but
when
not
riding
along
his
lines
or
among
the
camps
to
see
in
person
that
the
troops
were
properly
cared
for
generally
passed
his
time
in
close
attention
to
official
duties
connected
with
the
of
the
army
or
in
correspondence
with
the
authorities
at
richmond
when
he
relaxed
from
this
continuous
toil
it
was
to
indulge
in
some
quiet
and
simple
diversion
social
converse
with
ladies
in
houses
at
which
he
chanced
to
stop
caresses
bestowed
upon
children
with
whom
he
was
a
great
favorite
and
frequently
in
informal
conversation
with
his
officers
at
hayfield
and
moss
neck
two
hospitable
houses
below
fredericksburg
he
at
this
time
often
stopped
and
spent
some
time
in
the
society
of
the
ladies
and
children
there
one
of
the
latter
a
little
girl
would
come
up
to
him
always
to
receive
her
accustomed
kiss
and
one
day
confided
to
him
as
a
personal
friend
her
desire
to
kiss
general
jackson
who
blushed
like
a
girl
when
lee
with
a
quiet
laugh
told
him
of
the
child
wish
on
another
occasion
when
his
small
friend
came
to
receive
his
caress
he
said
laughing
that
she
would
show
more
taste
in
selecting
a
younger
gentleman
than
himself
and
pointing
to
a
youthful
officer
in
a
corner
of
the
room
added
there
is
the
handsome
major
pelham
which
caused
that
modest
young
soldier
to
blush
with
confusion
the
bearing
of
general
lee
in
these
hours
of
relaxation
was
quite
charming
and
made
him
warm
friends
his
own
pleasure
and
gratification
were
plain
and
gratified
others
who
in
the
simple
and
kindly
gentleman
in
the
plain
gray
uniform
found
it
difficult
to
recognize
the
of
the
southern
army
these
moments
of
relaxation
were
however
only
occasional
all
the
rest
was
toil
and
the
routine
of
hard
work
and
grave
assiduity
went
on
month
after
month
and
year
after
year
with
little
interruption
with
the
exceptions
which
we
have
noted
all
pleasures
and
distractions
seemed
of
little
interest
to
lee
and
to
the
present
writer
at
least
he
seemed
on
all
occasions
to
bear
the
most
striking
resemblance
to
the
traditional
idea
of
washington
high
principle
and
devotion
to
duty
were
plainly
this
human
being
springs
of
action
and
he
went
through
the
hard
and
continuous
labor
incident
to
army
command
with
a
grave
and
systematic
attention
wholly
indifferent
it
seemed
to
almost
every
species
of
diversion
and
relaxation
this
attempt
to
show
how
lee
appeared
at
that
time
to
his
solders
has
extended
to
undue
length
and
we
shall
be
compelled
to
defer
a
full
notice
of
the
most
interesting
and
beautiful
trait
of
his
character
this
was
his
humble
and
profound
piety
the
world
has
by
no
means
done
him
justice
upon
this
subject
no
one
doubted
during
the
war
that
general
lee
was
a
sincere
christian
in
conviction
and
his
exemplary
moral
character
and
life
were
beyond
criticism
beyond
this
it
is
doubtful
if
any
save
his
intimate
associates
understood
the
depth
of
his
feeling
on
the
greatest
of
all
subjects
jackson
strong
religious
fervor
was
known
and
often
alluded
to
but
it
is
doubtful
if
lee
was
regarded
as
a
person
of
equally
fervent
convictions
and
feelings
and
yet
the
fact
is
certain
that
faith
in
god
providence
and
reliance
upon
the
almighty
were
the
foundation
of
all
his
actions
and
the
secret
of
his
supreme
composure
under
all
trials
he
was
naturally
of
such
reserve
that
it
is
not
singular
that
the
extent
of
this
sentiment
was
not
understood
even
then
however
good
men
who
frequently
visited
him
and
conversed
with
him
upon
religious
subjects
came
away
with
their
hearts
burning
within
them
when
the
rev
william
jones
with
another
clergyman
went
in
to
consult
him
in
reference
to
the
better
observance
of
the
sabbath
in
the
army
his
eye
brightened
and
his
whole
countenance
glowed
with
pleasure
and
as
in
his
simple
feeling
words
he
expressed
his
delight
we
forgot
the
great
warrior
and
only
remembered
that
we
were
communing
with
an
humble
earnest
christian
when
he
was
informed
that
the
chaplains
prayed
for
him
tears
started
to
his
eyes
and
he
replied
i
sincerely
thank
you
for
that
and
i
can
only
say
that
i
am
a
poor
sinner
trusting
in
christ
alone
and
that
i
need
all
the
prayers
you
can
offer
for
me
on
the
day
after
this
interview
he
issued
an
earnest
general
order
enjoining
the
observance
of
the
sabbath
by
officers
and
men
urging
them
to
attend
public
worship
in
their
camps
and
forbidding
the
performance
on
sunday
of
all
official
duties
save
those
necessary
to
the
subsistence
or
safety
of
the
army
he
always
attended
public
worship
if
it
were
in
his
power
to
do
so
and
often
the
earnestness
of
the
preacher
would
make
his
eye
kindle
and
his
face
glow
he
frequently
attended
the
meetings
of
his
chaplains
took
a
warm
interest
in
the
proceedings
and
uniformly
exhibited
declares
one
who
could
speak
from
personal
knowledge
an
ardent
desire
for
the
promotion
of
religion
in
the
army
he
did
not
fail
on
many
occasions
to
show
his
men
that
he
was
a
sincere
christian
when
general
meade
came
over
to
mine
run
and
the
southern
army
marched
to
meet
him
lee
was
riding
along
his
line
of
battle
in
the
woods
when
he
came
upon
a
party
of
soldiers
holding
a
on
the
eve
of
battle
such
a
spectacle
was
not
unusual
in
the
army
then
and
afterward
the
rough
fighters
were
often
men
of
profound
piety
and
on
this
occasion
the
sight
before
him
seems
to
have
excited
deep
emotion
in
lee
he
stopped
dismounted
the
accompanying
him
did
the
same
and
lee
uncovered
his
head
and
stood
in
an
attitude
of
profound
respect
and
attention
while
the
earnest
prayer
proceeded
in
the
midst
of
the
thunder
of
artillery
and
the
explosion
of
the
shells

presented

the
fame
of
the
soldier
has
in
some
degree
thrown
into
the
background
the
trait
of
personal
piety
in
the
individual
no
delineation
of
lee

would
be
complete
without
a
full
statement
of
his
religious
principles
and
feelings
as
the
of
the
army
of
northern

he
won
that
august
renown
which
encircles
his
name
with
a
halo
of
military
glory
both
in
america
and
europe
his
battles
and
victories
are
known
to
all
men
it
is
not
known
to
all
that
the
illustrious
soldier
whose
fortune
it
was
to
overthrow
one
after
another
the
best
soldiers
of
the
federal
army
was
a
simple
humble
and
devoted
christian
whose
eyes
filled
with
tears
when
he
was
informed
that
his
chaplains
prayed
for
him
and
who
said

am
a
poor

in

of
general
hooker
lee
remained
throughout
the
winter
at
his
headquarters
in
the
woods
south
of
fredericksburg
watching
the
northern
army
which
continued
to
occupy
the
country
north
of
the
city
with
the
potomac
river
as
their
base
of
supplies
with
the
coming
of
spring
it
was
obviously
the
intention
of
the
federal
authorities
to
again
essay
the
crossing
of
the
rappahannock
at
some
point
either
above
or
below
fredericksburg
and
as
the
movement
above
was
less
difficult
and
promised
more
decisive
results
it
was
seen
by
general
lee
that
this
would
probably
be
the
quarter
from
which
he
might
expect
an
attack
general
stuart
a
soldier
of
sound
judgment
said
during
the
winter
the
next
battle
will
take
place
at
chancellorsville
and
the
position
of
lee
troops
seemed
to
indicate
that
this
was
also
his
own
opinion
his
right
remained
still
opposite
fredericksburg
barring
the
direct
approach
to
richmond
but
his
left
extended
up
the
rappahannock
beyond
chancellorsville
and
all
the
fords
were
vigilantly
guarded
to
prevent
a
sudden
flank
movement
by
the
enemy
in
that
direction
as
will
be
seen
the
anticipations
of
lee
were
to
be
fully
realized
the
heavy
blow
aimed
at
him
in
the
first
days
of
spring
was
to
come
from
the
quarter
in
which
he
had
expected
it
the
federal
army
was
now
under
command
of
general
joseph
hooker
an
officer
of
dash
energy
excellent
administrative
capacity
and
northern
writers
add
extremely
prone
to
general
hooker
had
harshly
criticised
the
military
operations
both
of
general
mcclellan
on
the
chickahominy
and
of
general
burnside
at
fredericksburg
and
so
strong
an
impression
had
these
strictures
made
upon
the
minds
of
the
authorities
that
they
came
to
the
determination
of
intrusting
the
command
of
the
army
to
the
officer
who
made
them
doubtless
concluding
that
his
own
success
would
prove
greater
than
that
of
his
predecessors
this
opinion
seemed
borne
out
by
the
first
proceedings
of
general
hooker
he
set
to
work
energetically
to
reorganize
and
increase
the
efficiency
of
the
army
did
away
with
general
burnside
defective
grand
division
arrangement
consolidated
the
cavalry
into
an
effective
corps
enforced
strict
discipline
among
officers
and
men
alike
and
at
the
beginning
of
spring
had
brought
his
army
to
a
high
state
of
efficiency
his
confident
tone
inspired
the
men
the
depression
resulting
from
the
great
disaster
at
fredericksburg
was
succeeded
by
a
spirit
of
buoyant
hope
and
the
army
was
once
more
that
great
ready
for
any
undertaking
which
it
had
been
under
mcclellan
it
numbered
according
to
one
federal
statement
one
hundred
and
thousand
three
hundred
men
but
according
to
another
which
appears
more
reliable
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
infantry
and
artillery
and
twelve
thousand
cavalry
in
all
one
hundred
and
thousand
troops
the
army
of
general
lee
was
considerably
smaller
two
divisions
of
longstreet
corps
had
been
sent
to
suffolk
south
of
james
river
to
obtain
supplies
in
that
region
and
this
force
was
not
present
at
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
the
actual
numbers
under
lee
command
will
appear
from
the
following
statement
of
colonel
walter
taylor
assistant
of
the
army
our
strength
at
chancellorsville
anderson
and
mclaws
jackson
hill
rodes
and
trimble
early
fredericksburg
cavalry
and
artillery
total
of
all
arms
as
the
federal
infantry
numbered
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
according
to
the
smallest
estimate
of
federal
authorities
and
infantry
forty
thousand
the
northern
force
was
precisely
three
times
as
large
as
the
southern
illustration
map
battle
of
chancellorsville
general
hooker
had
already
proved
himself
an
excellent
administrative
officer
and
his
plan
of
campaign
against
lee
seemed
to
show
that
he
also
possessed
generalship
of
a
high
order
he
had
determined
to
pass
the
rappahannock
above
fredericksburg
turn
lee
flank
and
thus
force
him
to
deliver
battle
under
this
disadvantage
or
retire
upon
richmond
the
safe
passage
of
the
stream
was
the
first
great
object
and
general
hooker
dispositions
to
effect
this
were
highly
judicious
a
force
of
about
twenty
thousand
men
was
to
pass
the
rappahannock
at
fredericksburg
and
thus
produce
upon
lee
the
impression
that
the
federal
army
was
about
to
renew
the
attempt
in
which
they
had
failed
under
general
burnside
while
general
attention
was
engaged
by
the
force
thus
threatening
his
right
the
main
body
of
the
northern
army
was
to
cross
the
rappahannock
and
rapidan
above
chancellorsville
and
sweeping
down
rapidly
upon
the
confederate
left
flank
take
up
a
strong
position
between
chancellorsville
and
fredericksburg
the
column
which
had
crossed
at
the
latter
point
to
engage
the
attention
of
the
confederate
commander
was
then
to
recross
to
the
northern
bank
move
rapidly
to
the
upper
fords
which
the
advance
of
the
main
body
would
by
that
time
have
uncovered
and
a
second
time
crossing
to
the
southern
bank
unite
with
the
rest
thus
the
whole
federal
army
would
be
concentrated
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
rappahannock
and
general
lee
would
be
compelled
to
leave
his
camps
on
the
hills
of
the
massaponnax
and
fight
upon
ground
dictated
by
his
adversary
if
he
did
not
thus
accept
battle
but
one
other
course
was
left
he
must
fall
back
in
the
direction
of
richmond
to
prevent
his
adversary
from
attacking
his
rear
and
capturing
or
destroying
his
army
in
order
to
insure
the
success
of
this
promising
plan
of
attack
a
strong
column
of
cavalry
was
to
cross
in
advance
of
the
army
and
strike
for
the
railroads
in
lee
rear
connecting
him
with
richmond
and
the
southwest
thus
flanked
or
cut
off
and
with
all
his
communications
destroyed
it
seemed
probable
that
general
lee
would
suffer
decisive
defeat
and
that
the
federal
army
would
march
in
triumph
to
the
capture
of
the
confederate
capital
this
plan
was
certainly
excellent
and
seemed
sure
to
succeed
it
was
however
open
to
some
criticism
as
the
event
showed
general
hooker
was
detaching
in
the
beginning
of
the
movement
his
whole
cavalry
force
for
a
distant
operation
and
dividing
his
army
by
the
at
fredericksburg
in
face
of
an
adversary
not
likely
to
permit
that
great
error
to
escape
him
while
advancing
thus
apparently
to
the
certain
destruction
of
lee
general
hooker
was
leaving
a
vulnerable
point
in
his
own
armor
lee
would
probably
discover
that
point
and
aim
to
pierce
his
opponent
there
at
most
general
hooker
was
wrapping
in
huge
folds
the
sword
of
lee
not
remembering
that
there
was
danger
to
the
as
well
as
to
the
weapon
such
was
the
plan
which
general
hooker
had
devised
to
bring
back
that
success
of
the
federal
arms
in
the
spring
of
which
had
attended
them
in
the
early
spring
of
at
this
latter
period
a
heavy
cloud
rested
upon
the
confederate
cause
donaldson
and
roanoke
island
fort
macon
and
the
city
of
new
orleans
had
then
fallen
at
elkhorn
kernstown
newbern
and
other
places
the
federal
forces
had
achieved
important
successes
these
had
been
followed
however
by
the
southern
victories
on
the
chickahominy
at
manassas
and
at
fredericksburg
near
this
spot
now
where
the
year
had
wound
up
with
so
mortifying
a
federal
failure
general
hooker
hoped
to
reverse
events
and
recover
the
federal
glories
of
the
preceding
spring
operations
began
as
early
as
the
middle
of
march
when
general
averill
with
about
three
thousand
cavalry
crossed
the
rappahannock
at
kelly
ford
above
its
junction
with
the
rapidan
and
made
a
determined
attack
upon
nearly
eight
hundred
horsemen
there
under
general
fitz
lee
with
the
view
of
passing
through
culpepper
crossing
the
rapidan
and
cutting
lee
communications
in
the
direction
of
gordonsville
the
obstinate
stand
of
general
fitz
lee
small
force
however
defeated
this
object
and
general
averill
was
forced
to
retreat
beyond
the
rappahannock
again
with
considerable
loss
and
abandon
his
expedition
in
this
engagement
fell
major
john
pelham
who
had
been
styled
in
lee
first
report
of
the
battle
of
fredericksburg
the
gallant
pelham
and
whose
brave
stand
on
the
port
royal
road
had
drawn
from
lee
the
exclamation
it
is
glorious
to
see
such
courage
in
one
so
young
pelham
was
in
spite
of
his
youth
an
artillerist
of
the
first
order
of
excellence
and
his
loss
was
a
serious
one
in
spite
of
his
inferior
rank
after
this
action
every
thing
remained
quiet
until
toward
the
end
of
april
general
lee
continuing
to
hold
the
same
position
with
his
right
at
fredericksburg
his
left
at
the
fords
near
chancellorsville
and
his
cavalry
under
stuart
guarding
the
banks
of
the
rappahannock
in
culpepper
on
the
of
april
general
hooker
began
his
forward
movement
by
advancing
three
corps
of
his
army
the
fifth
eleventh
and
twelfth
to
the
banks
of
the
river
near
kelly
ford
and
on
the
next
day
this
force
was
joined
by
three
additional
corps
the
first
third
and
sixth
and
the
whole
on
wednesday
the
crossed
the
river
without
difficulty
that
this
movement
was
a
surprise
to
lee
as
has
been
supposed
by
some
persons
is
a
mistake
stuart
was
an
extremely
vigilant
and
both
he
and
general
lee
were
in
the
habit
of
sending
accomplished
scouts
to
watch
any
movements
in
the
federal
camps
as
soon
as
these
movements
which
in
a
large
army
can
not
be
concealed
took
place
information
was
always
promptly
brought
and
it
was
not
possible
that
general
hooker
could
move
three
large
army
corps
toward
the
rappahannock
as
he
did
on
april
without
early
knowledge
on
the
part
of
his
adversary
of
so
important
a
circumstance
as
the
federal
infantry
thus
advanced
the
large
cavalry
force
began
also
to
move
through
culpepper
toward
the
central
railroad
in
rear
this
column
was
commanded
by
general
stoneman
formerly
a
subordinate
officer
in
lee
old
cavalry
regiment
in
the
united
states
army
and
as
general
stoneman
operations
were
entirely
separate
from
those
of
the
infantry
and
not
of
much
importance
we
shall
here
dismiss
them
in
a
few
words
he
proceeded
rapidly
across
culpepper
harassed
in
his
march
by
a
small
body
of
horse
under
general
william
lee
reached
the
central
railroad
at
trevillian
below
gordonsville
and
tore
up
a
portion
of
it
passed
on
to
james
river
ravaging
the
country
and
attempted
the
destruction
of
the
columbia
aqueduct
but
did
not
succeed
in
so
doing
when
hearing
probably
of
the
unforeseen
result
at
chancellorsville
he
hastened
back
to
the
rapidan
pursued
and
harassed
as
in
his
advance
and
crossing
regained
the
federal
lines
beyond
the
rappahannock
to
return
to
the
movements
of
the
main
federal
force
under
the
personal
command
of
general
hooker
this
advanced
rapidly
across
the
angle
between
the
two
rivers
with
no
obstruction
but
that
offered
by
the
cavalry
under
stuart
and
on
thursday
april
had
crossed
the
rapidan
at
germanna
and
ely
fords
and
was
steadily
concentrating
around
chancellorsville
at
the
same
time
the
second
corps
under
general
couch
was
preparing
to
cross
at
united
states
ford
a
few
miles
distant
and
general
sedgwick
commanding
the
detached
force
at
fredericksburg
having
crossed
and
threatened
lee
in
obedience
to
orders
now
began
passing
back
to
the
northern
bank
again
in
order
to
march
up
and
join
the
main
body
thus
all
things
seemed
in
train
to
succeed
on
the
side
of
the
federal
army
general
hooker
was
over
with
about
one
hundred
thousand
men
twenty
thousand
additional
troops
would
soon
join
him
lee
army
seemed
scattered
and
not
in
hand
to
oppose
him
and
there
was
some
ground
for
the
ebullition
of
joy
attributed
to
general
hooker
as
he
saw
his
great
force
massing
steadily
in
the
vicinity
of
chancellorsville
to
those
around
him
he
exclaimed
the
rebel
army
is
now
the
legitimate
property
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
they
may
as
well
pack
up
their
haversacks
and
make
for
richmond
and
i
shall
be
after
them
in
a
congratulatory
order
to
his
troops
he
declared
that
they
occupied
now
a
position
so
strong
that
the
enemy
must
either
ingloriously
fly
or
come
out
from
behind
his
defences
and
give
us
battle
on
our
own
ground
where
certain
destruction
awaits
him
such
were
the
joyful
anticipations
of
general
hooker
who
seems
to
have
regarded
the
campaign
as
virtually
ended
by
the
successful
passage
of
the
river
his
expressions
and
his
general
order
would
seem
to
indicate
an
irrepressible
joy
but
it
is
doubtful
if
the
skilful
soldiers
under
him
shared
this
somewhat
juvenile
enthusiasm
the
gray
cavalier
at
fredericksburg
was
not
reported
to
be
retiring
as
was
expected
on
the
contrary
the
southern
troops
seemed
to
be
moving
forward
with
the
design
of
accepting
battle
lee
had
determined
promptly
upon
that
course
as
soon
as
stuart
sent
him
information
of
the
enemy
movements
chancellorsville
was
at
once
seen
to
be
the
point
for
which
general
hooker
was
aiming
and
dispositions
were
made
for
confronting
him
there
and
fighting
a
pitched
battle
the
brigades
of
posey
and
mahone
of
division
had
been
in
front
of
banks
and
ely
fords
and
this
force
of
about
eight
thousand
men
was
promptly
ordered
to
fall
back
on
chancellorsville
at
the
same
time
wright
brigade
was
sent
up
to
reënforce
this
column
but
the
enemy
continuing
to
advance
in
great
force
general
anderson
commanding
the
whole
fell
back
from
chancellorsville
to
tabernacle
church
on
the
road
to
fredericksburg
where
he
was
joined
on
the
next
day
by
jackson
whom
lee
had
sent
forward
to
his
assistance
the
at
fredericksburg
had
not
long
deceived
the
confederate
commander
general
sedgwick
with
three
corps
in
all
about
thousand
men
had
crossed
just
below
fredericksburg
on
the
and
lee
had
promptly
directed
general
jackson
to
oppose
him
there
line
of
battle
was
accordingly
formed
in
the
enemy
front
beyond
crossing
but
as
neither
on
that
day
nor
the
next
any
further
advance
was
made
by
general
sedgwick
the
whole
movement
was
seen
to
be
a
feint
to
cover
the
real
operations
above
lee
accordingly
turned
his
attention
in
the
direction
of
chancellorsville
jackson
as
we
have
related
was
sent
up
to
reënforce
general
anderson
and
lee
followed
with
the
rest
of
the
army
with
the
exception
of
about
six
thousand
men
under
general
early
whom
he
left
to
defend
the
crossing
at
fredericksburg
such
were
the
positions
of
the
opposing
forces
on
the
day
of
may
each
commander
had
displayed
excellent
generalship
in
the
preliminary
movements
preceding
the
actual
fighting
at
last
however
the
opposing
lines
were
facing
each
other
and
the
real
struggle
was
about
to
begin
ii
the
wilderness
the
wilderness
as
the
region
around
chancellorsville
is
called
is
so
strange
a
country
and
the
character
of
the
ground
had
so
important
a
bearing
upon
the
result
of
the
great
battle
fought
there
that
a
brief
description
of
the
locality
will
be
here
presented
the
region
is
a
nearly
unbroken
expanse
of
dense
thicket
pierced
only
by
narrow
and
winding
roads
over
which
the
traveller
rides
mile
after
mile
without
seeing
a
single
human
habitation
it
would
seem
indeed
that
the
whole
barren
and
melancholy
tract
had
been
given
up
to
the
owl
the
whippoorwill
and
the
moccasin
its
original
tenants
the
plaintive
cries
of
the
alone
break
the
gloomy
silence
of
the
desolate
region
and
the
shadowy
thicket
stretching
in
every
direction
produces
a
depressing
effect
upon
the
feelings
chancellorsville
is
in
the
centre
of
this
singular
territory
on
the
main
road
or
rather
roads
running
from
orange
to
fredericksburg
from
which
latter
place
it
is
distant
about
ten
miles
in
spite
of
its
imposing
name
chancellorsville
was
simply
a
large
originally
inhabited
by
a
private
family
but
afterward
used
as
a
roadside
inn
a
little
to
the
westward
the
old
turnpike
and
orange
unite
as
they
approach
the
spot
where
they
again
divide
to
unite
a
second
time
a
few
miles
to
the
east
where
they
form
the
main
highway
to
fredericksburg
from
the
north
come
in
roads
from
united
states
and
ely
fords
germanna
ford
is
northwest
from
the
south
runs
the
brock
road
in
the
direction
of
the
rapidan
passing
a
mile
or
two
west
of
the
place
the
whole
country
the
roads
the
chance
houses
the
silence
the
unending
thicket
in
this
dreary
wilderness
produce
a
sombre
effect
a
writer
familiar
with
it
says
there
all
is
wild
desolate
and
lugubrious
thicket
undergrowth
and
jungle
stretch
for
miles
impenetrable
and
untouched
narrow
roads
wind
on
forever
between
melancholy
masses
of
stunted
and
gnarled
oak
little
sunlight
shines
there
the
face
of
nature
is
dreary
and
sad
it
was
so
before
the
battle
it
is
not
more
cheerful
when
as
you
ride
along
you
see
fragments
of
shell
rotting
knapsacks
rusty
bleached
bones
and
grinning
skulls
into
this
jungle
continues
the
same
writer
general
hooker
penetrated
it
was
the
wolf
in
his
den
ready
to
tear
any
one
who
approached
a
battle
there
seemed
impossible
neither
side
could
see
its
antagonist
artillery
could
not
move
cavalry
could
not
operate
the
very
infantry
had
to
flatten
their
bodies
to
glide
between
the
stunted
trees
that
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
should
have
chosen
that
spot
to
fight
forty
thousand
and
not
only
chosen
it
but
made
it
a
hundred
times
more
impenetrable
by
felling
trees
erecting
breastworks
disposing
artillery
to
sweep
every
road
and
which
led
to
chancellorsville
this
fact
seemed
incredible
it
was
no
part
of
the
original
plan
of
the
federal
commander
to
permit
himself
to
be
cooped
up
in
this
difficult
and
embarrassing
region
where
it
was
impossible
to
manoeuvre
his
large
army
the
selection
of
the
wilderness
around
chancellorsville
as
the
ground
of
battle
was
dictated
by
lee
general
hooker
it
seems
endeavored
to
avoid
being
thus
shut
up
in
the
thicket
and
hampered
in
his
movements
finding
that
the
confederate
force
retiring
from
in
front
of
ely
and
united
states
fords
had
on
reaching
chancellorsville
continued
to
fall
back
in
the
direction
of
fredericksburg
he
followed
them
steadily
passed
through
the
wilderness
and
emerging
into
the
open
country
beyond
rapidly
began
forming
line
of
battle
on
ground
highly
favorable
to
the
manoeuvring
of
his
large
force
in
action
a
glance
at
the
map
will
indicate
the
importance
of
this
movement
and
the
great
advantages
secured
by
it
the
left
of
general
hooker
line
nearest
the
river
was
at
least
five
miles
in
advance
of
chancellorsville
and
commanded
banks
ford
thereby
shortening
fully
the
distance
of
general
sedgwick
march
from
fredericksburg
by
enabling
him
to
use
the
ford
in
question
as
a
place
of
crossing
to
the
south
bank
and
uniting
his
column
with
the
main
body
the
centre
and
right
of
the
federal
army
had
in
like
manner
emerged
from
the
thickets
of
the
wilderness
and
occupied
cleared
ground
sufficiently
elevated
to
afford
them
great
advantages
this
was
in
the
forenoon
of
the
of
may
when
there
was
no
force
in
general
hooker
front
except
the
eight
thousand
men
of
anderson
at
tabernacle
church
jackson
had
marched
at
midnight
from
the
massaponnax
hills
with
a
general
order
from
lee
to
attack
and
repulse
the
enemy
but
had
not
yet
arrived
there
was
thus
no
serious
obstacle
in
the
path
of
the
federal
commander
who
had
it
in
his
power
it
would
seem
to
mass
his
entire
army
on
the
commanding
ground
which
his
vanguard
already
occupied
lee
was
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
position
and
had
he
not
been
delayed
by
the
feint
of
general
sedgwick
would
himself
have
seized
upon
it
as
it
was
general
hooker
seemed
to
have
won
the
prize
in
the
race
and
lee
would
apparently
be
forced
to
assail
him
on
his
strong
ground
or
retire
in
the
direction
of
richmond
the
movements
of
the
enemy
had
however
been
so
rapid
that
dispositions
seem
to
have
been
made
before
they
were
fully
developed
and
accurately
known
to
him
he
had
sent
forward
jackson
and
now
proceeded
to
follow
in
person
leaving
only
a
force
of
about
six
thousand
men
under
early
to
defend
the
crossing
at
fredericksburg
the
promptness
of
these
movements
of
the
confederate
commander
is
noticed
by
northern
writers
lee
with
instant
perception
of
the
situation
says
an
able
historian
now
seized
the
masses
of
his
force
and
with
the
grasp
of
a
titan
swung
them
into
position
as
a
giant
might
fling
a
mighty
stone
from
a
sling
footnote
swinton
in
campaigns
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
whether
the
force
under
lee
could
be
justly
described
as
mighty
however
the
reader
will
form
his
own
opinion
such
were
the
relative
positions
of
the
two
armies
on
the
of
may
general
hooker
forces
well
in
advance
of
chancellorsville
and
rapidly
forming
line
of
battle
on
a
ridge
in
open
country
general
lee
stretching
along
the
whole
distance
from
fredericksburg
to
tabernacle
church
and
certainly
not
in
any
condition
to
deliver
or
accept
battle
the
federal
commander
seemed
to
have
clearly
outgeneralled
his
adversary
and
humanly
speaking
the
movements
of
the
two
armies
up
to
this
time
seemed
to
point
to
a
decisive
federal
success
general
hooker
own
act
reversed
all
this
brilliant
promise
at
the
very
moment
when
his
army
was
steadily
concentrating
on
the
favorable
ground
in
advance
of
chancellorsville
the
federal
commander
for
some
reason
which
has
never
been
divulged
sent
a
peremptory
order
that
the
entire
force
should
fall
back
into
the
wilderness
this
order
reversing
every
thing
is
said
to
have
been
received
with
mingled
amazement
and
incredulity
by
his
officers
two
of
whom
sent
him
word
that
from
the
great
advantages
of
the
position
it
should
be
held
at
all
hazards
general
hooker
reply
was
return
at
once
the
army
accordingly
fell
back
to
chancellorsville
this
movement
undoubtedly
lost
general
hooker
all
the
advantages
which
up
to
that
moment
he
had
secured
what
his
motive
for
the
order
in
question
was
it
is
impossible
for
the
present
writer
to
understand
unless
the
approach
of
lee
powerfully
affected
his
imagination
and
he
supposed
the
thicket
around
chancellorsville
to
be
the
best
ground
to
receive
that
assault
which
the
bold
advance
of
his
opponent
appeared
to
foretell
whatever
his
motive
general
hooker
withdrew
his
lines
from
the
open
country
fell
back
to
the
vicinity
of
chancellorsville
and
began
to
erect
elaborate
defences
behind
which
to
receive
attack
in
this
backward
movement
he
was
followed
and
harassed
by
the
forces
of
jackson
the
command
of
anderson
being
in
front
jackson
maxim
was
to
always
press
an
enemy
when
he
was
retiring
and
no
sooner
had
the
federal
forces
begun
to
move
than
he
made
a
prompt
attack
he
continued
to
follow
them
up
toward
chancellorsville
until
nightfall
when
the
fighting
ceased
the
confederate
advance
having
been
pushed
to
alrich
house
within
about
two
miles
of
chancellorsville
here
the
outer
line
of
the
federal
works
was
found
and
jackson
paused
he
was
unwilling
at
so
late
an
hour
to
attempt
an
assault
upon
them
with
his
small
force
and
directing
further
movements
to
cease
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
lee
arrived
and
a
consultation
was
held
the
question
now
was
the
best
manner
with
a
force
of
about
thousand
to
drive
the
federal
army
of
about
one
hundred
thousand
beyond
the
rappahannock
iii
lee
determination
on
this
night
of
the
of
may
the
situation
of
affairs
was
strange
indeed
general
hooker
had
crossed
the
rappahannock
with
a
force
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
infantry
and
had
without
obstruction
secured
a
position
so
strong
he
declared
that
lee
must
either
ingloriously
fly
or
fight
a
battle
in
which
certain
destruction
awaited
him
so
absolutely
convinced
indeed
was
the
federal
commander
of
the
result
of
the
coming
encounter
that
he
had
jubilantly
described
the
southern
army
as
the
legitimate
property
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
which
in
the
event
of
the
retreat
of
the
confederates
would
be
after
them
there
seemed
just
grounds
for
this
declaration
whatever
question
may
have
arisen
of
the
good
taste
displayed
by
general
hooker
in
making
it
the
force
opposed
to
him
was
in
all
about
thousand
men
but
as
cavalry
take
small
part
in
pitched
battles
lee
fighting
force
was
only
about
forty
thousand
to
drive
back
forty
thousand
with
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
would
not
apparently
prove
difficult
and
it
was
no
doubt
this
conviction
which
had
occasioned
the
joyous
exclamation
of
general
hooker
but
his
own
act
and
the
nerve
of
his
adversary
had
defeated
every
thing
instead
of
retreating
with
his
small
force
upon
richmond
lee
had
advanced
to
accept
or
deliver
battle
this
bold
movement
which
general
hooker
does
not
seem
to
have
anticipated
paralyzed
his
energies
he
had
not
only
crossed
the
two
rivers
without
loss
but
had
taken
up
a
strong
position
where
he
could
manoeuvre
his
army
perfectly
when
in
consequence
of
lee
approach
with
the
evident
intent
of
fighting
he
had
ceased
to
advance
hesitated
and
ended
by
retiring
this
is
a
fair
summary
of
events
up
to
the
night
of
the
of
may
general
hooker
had
advanced
boldly
he
was
now
falling
back
he
had
foretold
that
his
adversary
would
ingloriously
fly
and
that
adversary
was
pressing
him
closely
the
army
of
the
potomac
he
had
declared
would
soon
be
after
the
army
of
northern
virginia
but
from
the
appearance
of
things
at
the
moment
the
army
of
northern
virginia
seemed
after
the
army
of
the
potomac
we
use
general
hooker
own
phrases
they
are
expressive
if
not
dignified
they
are
indeed
suited
to
the
subject
which
contains
no
little
of
the
grotesque
that
anticipations
and
expressions
so
confident
should
have
been
met
with
a
commentary
of
events
so
damaging
was
sufficient
had
the
occasion
not
been
so
tragic
to
cause
laughter
in
the
gravest
of
human
beings
lee
intent
was
now
unmistakable
instead
of
falling
back
from
the
rappahannock
to
some
line
of
defence
nearer
richmond
where
the
force
under
longstreet
at
suffolk
might
have
rejoined
him
with
other
reënforcements
he
had
plainly
resolved
with
the
forty
or
fifty
thousand
men
of
his
command
to
meet
general
hooker
in
open
battle
and
leave
the
event
to
providence
a
design
so
bold
would
seem
to
indicate
in
lee
a
quality
which
at
that
time
he
was
not
thought
to
possess
the
willingness
to
risk
decisive
defeat
by
military
movements
depending
for
their
success
upon
good
fortune
alone
such
seemed
now
the
only
ex
that
could
extricate
the
southern
army
from
disaster
and
a
crushing
defeat
at
that
time
would
have
had
terrible
results
there
was
no
other
force
save
the
small
body
under
longstreet
and
a
few
local
troops
to
protect
richmond
had
lee
been
disabled
and
afterward
pressed
by
general
hooker
it
is
impossible
to
see
that
any
thing
but
the
fall
of
the
confederate
capital
could
have
been
the
result
from
these
speculations
and
comments
we
pass
to
the
narrative
of
actual
events
general
hooker
had
abandoned
the
strong
position
in
advance
of
chancellorsville
and
retired
to
the
fastnesses
around
that
place
to
receive
the
southern
attack
his
further
proceedings
indicated
that
he
anticipated
an
assault
from
lee
the
federal
troops
had
no
sooner
regained
the
thicket
from
which
they
had
advanced
in
the
morning
than
they
were
ordered
to
erect
elaborate
works
for
the
protection
of
infantry
and
artillery
this
was
promptly
begun
and
by
the
next
morning
heavy
defences
had
sprung
up
as
if
by
magic
trees
had
been
felled
and
the
trunks
interwoven
so
as
to
present
a
formidable
obstacle
to
the
southern
attack
in
front
of
these
works
the
forest
had
been
levelled
and
the
fallen
trunks
were
left
lying
where
they
fell
forming
thus
an
sufficient
to
seriously
delay
an
assaulting
force
which
would
thus
be
at
every
step
of
the
necessarily
slow
advance
under
fire
on
the
roads
piercing
the
thicket
in
the
direction
of
the
confederates
cannon
were
posted
to
rake
the
approaches
to
the
federal
position
having
thus
made
his
preparations
to
receive
lee
attack
general
hooker
awaited
that
attack
no
doubt
confident
of
his
ability
to
repulse
it
his
line
resembled
in
some
degree
the
two
sides
of
an
oblong
square
the
longer
side
extending
east
and
west
in
front
that
is
to
say
south
of
chancellorsville
and
the
shorter
side
north
and
south
nearly
east
of
the
place
his
right
in
the
direction
of
wilderness
tavern
was
comparatively
undefended
as
it
was
not
expected
that
lee
would
venture
upon
a
movement
against
that
remote
point
this
line
it
would
appear
was
formed
with
a
view
to
the
possible
necessity
of
falling
back
toward
the
rappahannock
a
commander
determined
to
risk
everything
would
it
seems
have
fronted
lee
boldly
with
a
line
running
north
and
south
east
of
chancellorsville
general
main
front
was
nearly
east
and
west
whatever
may
have
been
his
object
in
so
establishing
it
on
the
night
of
the
of
may
as
we
have
said
lee
and
jackson
held
a
consultation
to
determine
the
best
method
of
attacking
the
federal
forces
on
the
next
day
all
the
information
which
they
had
been
able
to
obtain
of
the
federal
positions
east
and
south
of
chancellorsville
indicated
that
the
defences
in
both
these
quarters
were
such
as
to
render
an
assault
injudicious
jackson
had
found
his
advance
obstructed
by
strong
works
near
alrich
house
on
the
road
running
eastward
from
the
enemy
camps
and
general
stuart
and
general
wright
who
had
moved
to
the
left
and
advanced
upon
the
enemy
front
near
the
point
called
the
furnace
had
discovered
the
existence
of
powerful
defences
in
that
quarter
also
they
had
been
met
by
a
fierce
and
sudden
from
federal
epaulements
and
here
as
to
the
east
of
chancellorsville
the
enemy
had
evidently
fortified
their
position
under
these
circumstances
it
was
necessary
to
discover
if
possible
some
more
favorable
opening
for
an
attack
there
remained
but
one
other
general
hooker
right
west
of
chancellorsville
but
to
divide
the
army
as
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
attack
in
that
quarter
seemed
an
undertaking
too
hazardous
to
be
thought
of
to
execute
such
a
plan
of
assault
with
any
thing
like
a
hope
of
success
general
lee
would
be
compelled
to
detach
considerably
more
than
half
of
his
entire
force
this
would
leave
in
general
hooker
front
a
body
of
troops
too
inconsiderable
to
make
any
resistance
if
he
advanced
his
lines
and
thus
the
movement
promised
to
result
in
the
certain
destruction
of
one
portion
of
the
army
to
be
followed
by
a
triumphant
march
of
the
federal
forces
upon
richmond
in
the
council
of
war
between
lee
and
jackson
on
the
night
of
the
of
may
these
considerations
were
duly
weighed
and
the
whole
situation
discussed
in
the
end
the
hazardous
movement
against
general
hooker
right
beyond
chancellorsville
was
determined
upon
this
was
first
suggested
it
is
said
by
jackson
others
have
attributed
the
suggestion
to
lee
the
point
is
not
material
the
plan
was
adopted
and
lee
determined
to
detach
a
column
of
about
thousand
men
under
jackson
to
make
the
attack
on
the
next
day
his
plan
was
to
await
the
arrival
of
jackson
at
the
point
selected
for
attack
meanwhile
engaging
the
enemy
attention
by
demonstrations
in
their
front
when
guns
gave
the
signal
that
he
was
engaged
the
force
in
front
of
the
enemy
was
to
advance
and
participate
in
the
assault
and
thus
struck
in
front
and
flank
at
once
general
hooker
it
was
hoped
would
be
defeated
and
driven
back
across
the
rappahannock
there
was
another
possible
result
the
defeat
of
lee
and
jackson
by
general
hooker
but
the
desperate
character
of
the
situation
rendered
it
necessary
to
disregard
this
risk
by
midnight
this
plan
had
been
determined
upon
and
at
dawn
jackson
began
to
move
jackson
attack
and
fall
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
general
lee
was
early
in
the
saddle
and
rode
to
the
front
where
he
remained
in
personal
command
of
the
force
facing
the
enemy
main
line
of
battle
throughout
the
day
this
force
consisted
of
the
divisions
of
anderson
and
mclaws
and
amounted
to
thirteen
thousand
men
that
left
at
fredericksburg
as
we
have
said
under
general
early
numbered
six
thousand
men
and
the
thousand
which
jackson
had
taken
with
him
to
strike
at
the
enemy
right
made
up
the
full
body
of
troops
under
lee
that
is
to
say
a
little
over
forty
thousand
artillerymen
included
the
cavalry
numbering
four
or
five
thousand
were
like
the
absent
federal
cavalry
not
actually
engaged
in
accordance
with
the
plan
agreed
upon
between
lee
and
jackson
the
force
left
in
the
enemy
front
proceeded
to
engage
their
attention
and
desultory
fighting
continued
throughout
the
day
general
lee
meanwhile
awaited
the
sound
of
jackson
guns
west
of
chancellorsville
and
must
have
experienced
great
anxiety
at
this
trying
moment
although
with
his
accustomed
he
displayed
little
or
none
we
shall
now
leave
this
comparatively
interesting
portion
of
the
field
and
invite
the
attention
of
the
reader
to
the
movements
of
general
jackson
who
was
about
to
strike
his
last
great
blow
and
lose
his
own
life
in
the
moment
of
victory
jackson
set
out
at
early
dawn
having
under
him
three
divisions
commanded
by
rhodes
and
trimble
in
all
about
thousand
men
and
directed
his
march
over
the
old
mine
road
toward
the
furnace
about
a
mile
or
so
from
and
in
front
of
the
enemy
main
line
stuart
moved
with
his
cavalry
on
the
flank
of
the
column
with
the
view
of
masking
it
from
observation
and
it
reached
and
passed
the
furnace
where
a
regiment
with
artillery
was
left
to
guard
the
road
leading
thence
to
chancellorsville
and
repel
any
attack
which
might
be
made
upon
the
rear
of
the
column
just
as
the
passed
on
the
anticipated
attack
took
place
and
the
regiment
thus
left
the
georgia
was
suddenly
surrounded
and
the
whole
force
captured
the
confederate
artillery
however
opened
promptly
upon
the
assailing
force
drove
it
back
toward
chancellorsville
and
jackson
proceeded
on
his
march
without
further
interruption
he
had
thus
been
seen
but
it
seems
that
the
whole
movement
was
regarded
by
general
hooker
as
a
retreat
of
the
confederates
southward
a
bend
in
the
road
at
this
point
toward
the
south
leading
to
that
supposition
we
know
the
enemy
is
flying
general
hooker
wrote
on
the
afternoon
of
this
day
to
general
sedgwick
trying
to
save
his
trains
two
of
sickles
divisions
are
among
them
soon
after
leaving
the
furnace
however
jackson
following
the
same
turned
westward
and
marching
rapidly
between
the
walls
of
thicket
struck
into
the
brock
road
which
runs
in
a
direction
nearly
northwest
toward
germanna
and
ely
fords
this
would
enable
him
to
reach
without
discovery
the
orange
or
old
turnpike
west
of
chancellorsville
as
the
woods
through
which
the
narrow
highway
ran
completely
barred
him
from
observation
unless
federal
spies
were
lurking
in
the
covert
or
their
of
cavalry
came
in
sight
of
the
column
it
would
move
as
secure
from
discovery
as
though
it
were
a
hundred
miles
distant
from
the
enemy
and
against
the
latter
danger
of
stuart
presence
with
his
horsemen
provided
the
movement
was
thus
made
without
alarming
the
enemy
and
the
head
of
jackson
column
reached
the
orange
near
which
point
general
fitz
lee
invited
jackson
to
ride
up
to
a
slight
elevation
from
which
the
defences
of
the
enemy
were
visible
jackson
did
so
and
a
glance
showed
him
that
he
was
not
yet
sufficiently
upon
the
enemy
flank
he
accordingly
turned
to
an
aide
and
said
pointing
to
the
orange
tell
my
column
to
cross
that
road
the
column
did
so
continuing
to
advance
toward
the
rapidan
until
it
reached
the
old
turnpike
running
from
the
old
wilderness
tavern
toward
chancellorsville
at
this
point
jackson
found
himself
full
on
the
right
flank
of
general
hooker
and
halting
his
troops
proceeded
promptly
to
form
line
of
battle
for
the
attack
it
was
now
past
four
in
the
afternoon
and
the
declining
sun
warned
the
confederates
to
lose
no
time
the
character
of
the
ground
was
however
such
as
to
dismay
any
but
the
most
resolute
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
execute
the
intended
movement
with
any
thing
like
rapidity
in
such
a
jungle
on
both
sides
of
the
old
turnpike
rose
a
wall
of
thicket
through
which
it
was
impossible
to
move
a
regular
line
of
battle
all
the
rules
of
war
must
be
reversed
in
face
of
this
obstacle
and
the
assault
on
general
hooker
works
seemed
destined
to
be
made
in
column
of
infantry
companies
and
with
the
artillery
moving
in
column
of
pieces
despite
these
serious
obstacles
jackson
hastened
to
form
such
order
of
battle
as
was
possible
and
with
rodes
division
in
front
followed
by
colston
trimble
and
hill
advanced
steadily
down
the
old
turnpike
toward
chancellorsville
he
had
determined
not
only
to
strike
the
enemy
right
flank
but
to
execute
if
possible
a
still
more
important
movement
this
was
to
extend
his
lines
steadily
to
the
left
swing
round
his
left
wing
and
so
interpose
himself
between
general
hooker
and
the
rapidan
this
design
of
unsurpassed
boldness
continued
to
burn
in
jackson
brain
until
he
fell
and
almost
his
last
words
were
an
allusion
to
it
the
federal
line
of
works
which
the
confederates
thus
advanced
to
assault
extended
across
the
old
turnpike
near
the
house
of
melzi
chancellor
and
behind
was
a
second
line
which
was
covered
by
the
federal
artillery
in
the
earthworks
near
chancellorsville
the
eleventh
corps
under
general
howard
was
that
destined
to
receive
jackson
assault
this
was
made
at
a
few
minutes
past
five
in
the
evening
and
proved
decisive
the
federal
troops
were
surprised
at
their
suppers
and
were
wholly
unprepared
they
had
scarcely
time
to
run
to
their
muskets
which
were
stacked
near
at
hand
when
rodes
burst
upon
them
stormed
their
works
over
which
the
troops
marched
almost
unresisted
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
entire
corps
holding
the
federal
right
was
in
hopeless
disorder
rodes
pressed
on
followed
by
the
division
in
his
rear
and
the
affair
became
rather
a
hunt
than
a
battle
the
confederates
pursued
with
yells
killing
or
capturing
all
with
whom
they
could
come
up
the
federal
artillery
rushed
off
at
a
gallop
striking
against
and
overturning
and
the
army
of
general
hooker
seemed
about
to
be
hopelessly
routed
this
is
the
account
given
by
northern
writers
who
represent
the
effect
of
jackson
sudden
attack
as
indescribable
it
had
a
serious
effect
as
will
be
subsequently
shown
on
the
both
of
general
hooker
and
his
army
while
opposing
the
heavy
demonstrations
of
general
forces
on
their
left
and
in
front
this
storm
had
burst
upon
them
from
a
quarter
in
which
no
one
expected
it
they
were
thus
caught
between
two
fires
and
ignorant
as
they
were
of
the
small
number
of
the
confederates
must
have
regarded
the
army
as
seriously
imperilled
footnote
their
arms
were
stacked
and
the
men
were
away
from
them
and
scattered
about
for
the
purpose
of
cooking
their
suppers
jackson
continued
to
pursue
the
enemy
on
the
road
to
chancellorsville
intent
now
upon
making
his
blow
decisive
by
swinging
round
his
left
and
cutting
off
the
federal
army
from
the
rappahannock
it
was
impossible
however
to
execute
so
important
a
movement
until
his
troops
were
well
in
hand
and
the
two
divisions
which
had
made
the
attack
had
become
mixed
up
in
a
very
confused
manner
they
were
accordingly
directed
to
halt
and
general
hill
whose
division
had
not
been
engaged
was
sent
for
and
ordered
to
advance
to
the
front
thus
affording
the
disordered
divisions
an
opportunity
to
reform
their
broken
lines
soon
after
dispatching
this
order
jackson
rode
out
in
front
of
his
line
on
the
chancellorsville
road
in
order
to
reconnoitre
in
person
and
ascertain
if
possible
the
position
and
movements
of
the
enemy
then
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
him
it
was
now
between
nine
and
ten
at
night
the
fighting
had
temporarily
ceased
and
the
moon
through
misty
clouds
lit
up
the
dreary
thickets
in
which
no
sound
was
heard
but
the
incessant
and
melancholy
cries
of
the
whippoorwills
jackson
had
ridden
forward
about
a
hundred
yards
in
advance
of
his
line
on
the
turnpike
accompanied
by
a
few
officers
and
had
checked
his
horse
to
listen
for
any
sound
coming
from
the
direction
of
chancellorsville
when
suddenly
a
volley
was
fired
by
his
own
infantry
on
the
right
of
the
road
apparently
directed
at
him
and
his
companions
under
the
impression
that
they
were
a
federal
several
of
the
party
fell
from
their
horses
and
wheeling
to
the
left
jackson
galloped
into
the
wood
to
escape
a
renewal
of
the
fire
the
result
was
melancholy
he
passed
directly
in
front
of
his
men
who
had
been
warned
to
guard
against
an
attack
of
cavalry
in
their
excited
state
so
near
the
enemy
and
surrounded
by
darkness
jackson
was
supposed
to
be
a
federal
cavalryman
the
men
accordingly
fired
upon
him
at
not
more
than
twenty
paces
and
wounded
him
in
three
places
twice
in
the
left
arm
and
once
in
the
right
hand
at
the
instant
when
he
was
struck
he
was
holding
his
bridle
with
his
left
hand
and
had
his
right
hand
raised
either
to
protect
his
face
from
boughs
or
in
the
strange
gesture
habitual
to
him
in
battle
as
the
bullets
passed
through
his
arm
he
dropped
the
bridle
of
his
horse
from
his
left
hand
but
seized
it
again
with
the
bleeding
fingers
of
his
right
hand
when
the
animal
wheeling
suddenly
darted
toward
chancellorsville
in
doing
so
he
passed
beneath
the
limb
of
a
which
struck
the
wounded
man
in
the
face
tore
off
his
cap
and
threw
him
back
on
his
horse
nearly
dismounting
him
he
succeeded
however
in
retaining
his
seat
and
regained
the
road
where
he
was
received
in
the
arms
of
captain
wilbourn
one
of
his
and
laid
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
the
fire
had
suddenly
ceased
and
all
was
again
still
only
captain
wilbourn
and
a
courier
were
with
jackson
but
a
shadowy
figure
on
horseback
was
seen
in
the
edge
of
the
wood
near
silent
and
motionless
when
captain
wilbourn
called
to
this
person
and
directed
him
to
ride
back
and
see
what
troops
had
thus
fired
upon
them
the
silent
figure
disappeared
and
did
not
return
who
this
could
have
been
was
long
a
mystery
but
it
appears
from
a
recent
statement
of
general
revere
of
the
federal
army
that
it
was
himself
he
had
advanced
to
the
front
to
reconnoitre
had
come
on
the
group
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
receiving
the
order
above
mentioned
had
thought
it
prudent
not
to
reveal
his
real
character
he
accordingly
rode
into
the
wood
and
regained
his
own
lines
a
few
words
will
terminate
our
account
of
this
melancholy
event
in
the
history
of
the
war
the
fall
of
jackson
he
was
supported
to
the
rear
by
his
officers
and
during
this
painful
progress
gave
his
last
order
general
pender
recognized
him
and
stated
that
he
feared
he
could
not
hold
his
position
jackson
eye
flashed
and
he
replied
with
animation
you
must
hold
your
ground
general
pender
you
must
hold
your
ground
sir
he
was
now
so
weak
as
to
be
unable
to
walk
even
leaning
on
the
shoulders
of
his
officers
he
was
accordingly
placed
on
a
litter
and
borne
toward
the
rear
before
the
litter
had
gone
far
a
furious
swept
the
road
from
the
direction
of
chancellorsville
and
the
bearers
lowered
it
to
the
earth
and
lay
down
beside
it
the
fire
relaxing
they
again
moved
but
one
of
the
bearers
stumbled
over
a
root
and
let
the
litter
fall
jackson
groaned
and
as
the
moonlight
fell
upon
his
face
it
was
seen
to
be
so
pale
that
he
appeared
to
be
about
to
die
when
asked
if
he
was
much
hurt
he
opened
his
eyes
however
and
said
no
my
friend
do
trouble
yourself
about
me
he
was
then
borne
to
the
rear
placed
in
an
ambulance
and
carried
to
the
hospital
at
the
old
wilderness
tavern
where
he
remained
until
he
was
taken
to
guinea
station
where
he
died
such
was
the
fate
of
lee
great
lieutenant
the
man
whom
he
spoke
of
as
his
right
arm
whose
death
struck
a
chill
to
the
hearts
of
the
southern
people
from
which
they
never
recovered
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
general
lee
was
not
informed
of
the
misfortune
which
had
befallen
his
great
lieutenant
until
toward
daybreak
on
the
next
morning
this
fact
was
doubtless
attributable
to
the
difficult
character
of
the
country
the
interposition
of
the
federal
army
between
the
two
confederate
wings
which
rendered
a
long
détour
necessary
in
reaching
lee
and
the
general
confusion
and
dismay
attending
jackson
fall
it
would
be
difficult
indeed
to
form
an
exaggerated
estimate
of
the
condition
of
jackson
corps
at
this
time
the
troops
had
been
thrown
into
what
seemed
inextricable
disorder
in
consequence
of
the
darkness
and
the
headlong
advance
of
the
second
calston
division
upon
the
heels
of
rhodes
which
had
resulted
in
a
complete
intermingling
of
the
two
commands
and
to
make
matters
worse
general
hill
the
second
in
command
had
been
wounded
and
disabled
nearly
at
the
same
moment
with
jackson
by
the
of
the
enemy
this
transferred
the
command
of
military
right
to
the
brave
and
skilful
general
rhodes
the
ranking
officer
after
hill
but
rhodes
was
only
a
and
had
for
that
reason
never
come
into
personal
contact
with
the
whole
corps
who
knew
little
of
him
and
was
not
aware
of
jackson
plans
and
distrusted
under
these
circumstances
his
ability
to
conduct
to
a
successful
issue
so
vitally
important
an
operation
as
that
intrusted
to
this
great
wing
of
the
southern
army
stuart
who
had
gone
with
his
cavalry
toward
ely
ford
to
make
a
demonstration
on
the
federal
rear
was
therefore
sent
for
and
rode
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
the
scene
of
action
and
the
command
was
formally
relinquished
to
him
by
general
rhodes
jackson
sent
stuart
word
from
wilderness
tavern
to
act
upon
his
own
judgment
and
do
what
he
thought
best
as
he
had
implicit
confidence
in
him
but
in
consequence
of
the
darkness
and
confusion
it
was
impossible
for
stuart
to
promptly
reform
the
lines
and
thus
all
things
remained
entangled
and
confused
it
was
essential
however
to
inform
general
lee
of
the
state
of
affairs
and
jackson
colonel
pendleton
requested
captain
wilbourn
who
had
witnessed
all
the
details
of
the
painful
scene
in
the
wood
to
go
to
general
lee
and
acquaint
him
with
what
had
taken
place
and
receive
his
orders
from
a
statement
of
this
meritorious
officer
we
take
these
brief
details
of
the
interview
lee
was
found
lying
asleep
in
a
little
clump
of
pines
near
his
front
covered
with
an
to
protect
him
from
the
dews
of
the
night
and
surrounded
by
the
officers
of
his
staff
also
asleep
it
was
not
yet
daybreak
and
the
darkness
prevented
the
messenger
from
distinguishing
the
from
the
rest
he
accordingly
called
for
major
taylor
lee
and
that
officer
promptly
awoke
when
he
was
informed
of
what
had
taken
place
as
the
conversation
continued
the
sound
awoke
general
lee
who
asked
who
is
there
major
taylor
informed
him
and
rising
upon
his
elbow
lee
pointed
to
his
blankets
and
said
sit
down
here
by
me
captain
and
tell
me
all
about
the
fight
last
evening
he
listened
without
comment
during
the
recital
but
when
it
was
finished
said
with
great
feeling
ah
captain
any
victory
is
dearly
bought
which
deprives
us
of
the
services
of
general
jackson
even
for
a
short
time
from
this
reply
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
regard
the
wounds
received
by
jackson
as
of
a
serious
character
as
was
natural
from
the
fact
that
they
were
only
in
the
arm
and
hand
and
believed
that
the
only
result
would
be
a
temporary
absence
of
his
lieutenant
from
command
as
captain
wilbourn
continued
to
speak
of
the
incident
lee
added
with
greater
emotion
than
at
first
ah
talk
about
it
thank
god
it
is
no
worse
he
then
remained
silent
but
seeing
captain
wilbourn
rise
as
if
to
go
he
requested
him
to
remain
as
he
wished
to
talk
with
him
some
more
and
proceeded
to
ask
a
number
of
questions
in
reference
to
the
position
of
the
troops
who
was
in
command
etc
when
informed
that
rhodes
was
in
temporary
command
but
that
stuart
had
been
sent
for
he
exclaimed
rhodes
is
a
gallant
courageous
and
energetic
officer
and
asked
where
jackson
and
stuart
could
be
found
calling
for
paper
and
pencil
to
write
to
them
captain
wilbourn
added
that
from
what
he
had
heard
jackson
say
he
thought
he
intended
to
get
possession
if
possible
of
the
road
to
united
states
ford
in
the
federal
rear
and
so
cut
them
off
from
the
river
that
night
or
early
in
the
morning
at
these
words
lee
rose
quickly
and
said
with
animation
these
people
must
be
pressed
it
would
seem
that
at
this
moment
a
messenger
probably
captain
hotchkiss
jackson
skilful
engineer
arrived
from
wilderness
tavern
bringing
a
note
from
the
wounded
general
lee
read
it
with
much
feeling
and
dictated
the
following
reply
general
i
have
just
received
your
note
informing
me
that
you
were
wounded
i
can
not
express
my
regret
at
the
occurrence
could

i
should
have
chosen
for
the
good
of

to
have
been
disabled
in
your
stead
i
congratulate
you
upon
the
victory
which
is

skill
and
energy
lee
this
was
dispatched
with
a
second
note
to
stuart
directing
him
to
assume
command
and
press
the
enemy
at
dawn
lee
then
mounted
his
horse
and
just
as
the
day
began
to
break
formed
line
of
battle
opposite
the
enemy
front
his
line
extending
on
the
right
to
the
running
from
chancellorsville
in
the
direction
of
fredericksburg
this
force
under
the
personal
command
of
lee
amounted
as
we
have
said
originally
to
about
thirteen
thousand
men
and
as
their
loss
had
not
been
very
severe
in
the
demonstrations
made
against
the
enemy
on
the
preceding
days
they
were
in
good
condition
the
obvious
course
now
was
to
place
the
troops
in
a
position
which
would
enable
them
in
the
event
of
stuart
success
in
driving
the
federal
right
to
unite
the
left
of
lee
line
with
the
right
of
stuart
and
so
press
the
federal
army
back
on
chancellorsville
and
the
river
we
shall
now
return
to
the
left
wing
of
the
army
which
in
spite
of
the
absence
of
the
commanding
general
was
the
column
of
attack
which
was
looked
to
for
the
most
important
results
in
response
to
the
summons
of
the
preceding
night
stuart
had
come
back
from
the
direction
of
ely
ford
at
a
swift
gallop
burning
with
ardor
at
the
thought
of
leading
jackson
great
corps
into
battle
the
military
ambition
of
this
distinguished
commander
of
lee
horse
was
great
and
he
had
often
chafed
at
the
jests
directed
at
the
cavalry
arm
and
at
himself
as
only
a
he
had
now
presented
to
him
an
opportunity
of
showing
that
he
was
a
trained
soldier
competent
by
his
nerve
and
military
ability
to
lead
any
arm
of
the
service
and
greeted
the
occasion
with
delight
the
men
of
jackson
had
been
accustomed
to
see
that
commander
pass
slowly
along
their
lines
on
a
horse
as
as
himself
a
figure
with
little
of
the
poetry
of
war
in
his
appearance
they
now
found
themselves
commanded
by
a
youthful
and
daring
cavalier
on
a
spirited
animal
with
floating
plume
silken
sash
and
a
sabre
which
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
as
its
owner
galloped
to
and
fro
cheering
the
men
and
marshalling
them
for
the
coming
assault
as
he
led
the
lines
afterward
with
joyous
vivacity
his
sabre
drawn
his
plume
floating
proudly
one
of
the
men
compared
him
to
henry
of
navarre
at
the
battle
of
ivry
but
stuart
spirit
of
wild
gayety
destroyed
the
romantic
dignity
of
the
scene
he
led
the
men
of
jackson
against
general
hooker
breastworks
bristling
with
cannon
singing
old
joe
hooker
will
you
come
out
of
the
wilderness
this
sketch
will
convey
a
correct
idea
of
the
officer
who
had
now
grasped
the
bâton
falling
from
the
hand
of
the
great
marshal
of
lee
it
was
probable
that
the
advance
of
the
infantry
under
such
a
commander
would
partake
of
the
rush
and
rapidity
of
a
and
the
sequel
justified
this
view
at
early
dawn
the
southern
lines
began
to
move
either
in
consequence
of
orders
from
lee
or
following
his
own
conception
stuart
reversed
the
movement
of
jackson
who
had
aimed
to
swing
round
his
left
and
cut
off
the
enemy
he
seemed
to
have
determined
to
extend
his
right
with
the
view
of
uniting
with
the
left
of
anderson
division
under
lee
and
enclosing
the
enemy
in
the
angle
near
chancellorsville
lee
had
moved
at
the
same
moment
on
their
front
advancing
steadily
over
all
obstacles
and
a
northern
writer
who
witnessed
the
combined
attack
speaks
of
it
in
enthusiastic
terms
from
the
large
brick
house
which
gives
the
name
to
this
vicinity
says
the
writer
speaking
of
chancellorsville
the
enemy
could
be
seen
sweeping
slowly
but
confidently
determinedly
and
surely
through
the
clearings
which
extended
in
front
nothing
could
excite
more
admiration
for
the
qualities
of
the
veteran
soldiers
than
the
manner
in
which
the
enemy
swept
out
as
they
moved
steadily
onward
the
forces
which
were
opposed
to
them
we
say
it
reluctantly
and
for
the
first
time
that
the
enemy
have
shown
the
finest
qualities
and
we
acknowledge
on
this
occasion
their
superiority
in
the
open
field
to
our
own
men
they
delivered
their
fire
with
precision
and
were
apparently
inflexible
and
immovable
under
the
storm
of
bullets
and
shell
which
they
were
constantly
receiving
coming
to
a
piece
of
timber
which
was
occupied
by
a
division
of
our
own
men
half
the
number
were
detailed
to
clear
the
woods
it
seemed
certain
that
here
they
would
be
repulsed
but
they
marched
right
through
the
wood
driving
our
own
soldiers
out
who
delivered
their
fire
and
fell
back
halted
again
fired
and
fell
back
as
before
seeming
to
concede
to
the
enemy
as
a
matter
of
course
the
superiority
which
they
evidently
felt
themselves
our
own
men
fought
well
there
was
no
lack
of
courage
but
an
evident
feeling
that
they
were
destined
to
be
beaten
and
the
only
thing
for
them
to
do
was
to
fire
and
retreat
this
description
of
the
steady
advance
of
the
southern
line
applies
rather
to
the
first
portion
of
the
attack
which
compelled
the
front
line
of
the
federal
army
to
retire
to
the
stronger
ground
in
rear
when
this
was
reached
and
the
troops
of
lee
saw
before
them
the
last
citadel
the
steady
advance
became
a
rush
the
divisions
of
anderson
and
mclaws
on
the
right
made
a
determined
charge
upon
the
great
force
under
generals
hancock
slocum
and
others
in
that
quarter
and
stuart
closed
in
on
the
federal
right
steadily
extending
his
line
to
join
on
to
anderson
the
spectacle
here
was
superb
as
the
troops
rushed
on
stuart
shouted
charge
and
remember
jackson
and
this
watchword
seemed
to
drive
the
line
forward
with
stuart
leading
them
and
singing
in
his
joyous
voice
old
joe
hooker
will
you
come
out
of
the
wilderness
for
courage
poetry
and
seeming
frivolity
were
strangely
mingled
in
this
great
soldier
the
troops
went
headlong
at
the
federal
works
and
in
a
few
moments
the
real
struggle
of
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
had
begun
from
this
instant
when
the
lines
respectively
commanded
in
person
by
lee
and
by
stuart
closed
in
with
the
enemy
there
was
little
manoeuvring
of
any
description
it
was
an
open
attempt
of
lee
by
hard
fighting
to
crush
in
the
enemy
front
and
force
them
back
upon
the
river
in
this
arduous
struggle
it
is
due
to
stuart
to
say
that
his
generalship
largely
decided
the
event
and
the
high
commendation
which
he
afterward
received
from
general
lee
justifies
the
statement
as
his
lines
went
to
the
attack
his
quick
military
eye
discerned
an
elevated
point
on
his
right
from
which
it
appeared
an
woulden
filade
the
federal
line
about
thirty
pieces
of
cannon
were
at
once
hastened
to
this
point
and
a
destructive
fire
opened
on
the
lines
of
general
slocum
which
threw
his
troops
into
great
confusion
so
serious
was
this
fire
that
general
slocum
sent
word
to
general
hooker
that
his
front
was
being
swept
away
by
it
to
which
the
sullen
response
was
i
can
not
make
soldiers
or
ammunition
general
hooker
was
indeed
it
seems
at
this
moment
in
no
mood
to
take
a
hopeful
view
of
affairs
the
heavy
assault
of
jackson
appears
to
have
as
much
demoralized
the
federal
commander
as
his
troops
during
the
night
he
had
erected
a
semicircular
line
of
works
in
the
form
of
a
redan
in
his
rear
toward
the
river
behind
which
new
works
he
no
doubt
contemplated
falling
back
he
now
awaited
the
result
of
the
southern
attack
leaning
against
a
pillar
of
the
porch
at
the
chancellorsville
house
when
a
struck
the
pillar
throwing
it
down
and
so
stunning
the
general
as
to
prevent
him
from
retaining
the
command
which
was
delegated
to
general
couch
illustration
chancellorsville
the
fate
of
the
day
had
now
been
decided
the
right
wing
of
the
southern
army
under
lee
had
gradually
extended
its
left
to
meet
the
extension
of
stuart
right
and
this
junction
of
the
two
wings
having
been
effected
lee
took
personal
command
of
all
and
advanced
his
whole
front
in
a
decisive
assault
before
this
the
federal
front
gave
way
and
the
disordered
troops
were
huddled
back
now
only
a
confused
and
disorganized
mass
upon
chancellorsville
the
southern
troops
pursued
with
yells
leaping
over
the
earthworks
and
driving
all
before
them
a
scene
of
singular
horror
ensued
the
chancellorsville
house
which
had
been
set
on
fire
by
shell
was
seen
to
spout
flame
from
every
window
and
the
adjoining
woods
had
in
like
manner
caught
fire
and
were
heard
roaring
over
the
dead
and
wounded
of
both
sides
alike
the
thicket
had
become
the
scene
of
the
cruellest
of
all
agonies
for
the
unfortunates
unable
to
extricate
themselves
the
whole
spectacle
in
the
vicinity
of
the
chancellorsville
house
now
in
possession
was
frightful
fire
smoke
blood
confused
yells
and
dying
groans
mingled
to
form
the
dark
picture
lee
had
ridden
to
the
front
of
his
line
following
up
the
enemy
and
as
he
passed
before
the
troops
they
greeted
him
with
one
prolonged
unbroken
cheer
in
which
those
wounded
and
lying
upon
the
ground
united
in
that
cheer
spoke
the
fierce
joy
of
men
whom
the
hard
combat
had
turned
into
arousing
all
the
ferocious
instincts
of
the
human
soul
lee
sat
on
his
horse
motionless
near
the
chancellorsville
house
his
face
and
figure
lit
up
by
the
glare
of
the
burning
woods
and
gave
his
first
attention
even
at
this
exciting
moment
to
the
unfortunates
of
both
sides
wounded
and
in
danger
of
being
burned
to
death
while
issuing
his
orders
on
this
subject
a
note
was
brought
to
him
from
jackson
congratulating
him
upon
his
victory
after
reading
it
with
evidences
of
much
emotion
he
turned
to
the
officer
who
had
brought
it
and
said
say
to
general
jackson
that
the
victory
is
his
and
that
the
congratulation
is
due
to
him
the
federal
army
had
fallen
back
in
disorder
by
this
time
toward
their
second
line
it
was
about
ten
in
the
morning
and
chancellorsville
was
in
lee
possession
flank
movement
of
general
sedgwick
lee
hastened
to
bring
the
southern
troops
into
order
again
and
succeeded
in
promptly
reforming
his
line
of
battle
his
front
extending
unbroken
along
the
old
turnpike
facing
the
river
his
design
was
to
press
general
hooker
and
reap
those
rich
rewards
of
victory
to
which
the
hard
fighting
of
the
men
had
entitled
them
of
the
demoralized
condition
of
the
federal
forces
there
can
be
no
doubt
and
the
obvious
course
now
was
to
follow
up
their
retreat
and
endeavor
to
drive
them
in
disorder
beyond
the
rappahannock
the
order
to
advance
upon
the
enemy
was
about
to
be
given
when
a
messenger
from
fredericksburg
arrived
at
full
gallop
and
communicated
intelligence
which
arrested
the
order
just
as
it
was
on
lee
lips
a
considerable
force
of
the
enemy
was
advancing
up
the
turnpike
from
fredericksburg
to
fall
upon
his
right
flank
and
upon
his
rear
in
case
he
moved
beyond
chancellorsville
the
column
was
that
of
general
sedgwick
this
officer
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
detached
to
make
a
heavy
demonstration
at
fredericksburg
and
was
still
at
that
point
with
his
troops
drawn
up
on
the
southern
bank
three
miles
below
the
city
on
saturday
night
while
jackson
was
fighting
on
that
morning
general
hooker
had
sent
for
reynolds
corps
but
even
in
the
absence
of
this
force
general
sedgwick
retained
under
him
about
thousand
men
and
this
column
was
now
ordered
to
storm
the
heights
at
fredericksburg
march
up
the
turnpike
and
attack
lee
in
flank
general
sedgwick
received
the
order
at
eleven
on
saturday
night
about
the
time
when
jackson
was
carried
wounded
to
the
rear
he
immediately
made
his
preparations
to
obey
and
at
daylight
moved
up
from
below
the
city
to
storm
the
ridge
at
marye
and
march
straight
upon
chancellorsville
in
the
first
assaults
he
failed
suffering
considerable
loss
from
the
fire
of
the
southern
troops
under
general
barksdale
commanding
the
line
at
that
point
but
subsequently
forming
an
assaulting
column
for
a
straight
rush
at
the
hill
he
went
forward
with
impetuosity
drove
the
southern
advanced
line
from
behind
the
stone
wall
which
generals
sumner
and
hooker
had
failed
in
reaching
and
about
eleven
in
the
morning
stormed
marye
hill
and
killed
captured
or
dispersed
the
entire
southern
force
there
the
confederates
fought
hand
to
hand
over
their
guns
with
the
enemy
for
the
possession
of
the
crest
but
their
numbers
were
inadequate
the
entire
surviving
force
fell
back
over
the
telegraph
road
southward
and
general
sedgwick
promptly
advanced
up
the
turnpike
leading
from
fredericksburg
to
chancellorsville
to
assail
general
lee
it
was
the
intelligence
of
this
threatening
movement
which
now
reached
lee
and
induced
him
to
defer
further
attack
at
the
moment
upon
general
hooker
he
determined
promptly
to
send
a
force
against
general
sedgwick
and
this
resolution
seems
to
have
been
based
upon
sound
military
judgment
there
was
little
to
be
feared
now
from
general
hooker
large
as
the
force
still
was
under
that
officer
he
was
paralyzed
for
the
time
and
would
not
probably
venture
upon
any
attempt
to
regain
possession
of
chancellorsville
with
general
sedgwick
it
was
different
his
column
was
comparatively
fresh
was
flushed
with
victory
and
numbered
even
after
his
loss
of
one
thousand
more
than
twenty
thousand
men
compared
with
the
entire
federal
army
this
force
was
merely
a
detachment
it
was
true
but
it
was
a
detachment
numbering
as
many
men
probably
as
the
effective
of
lee
entire
army
at
chancellorsville
he
had
carried
into
that
fight
about
thousand
men
his
losses
had
been
heavy
and
the
commands
were
much
shaken
to
have
advanced
under
these
circumstances
upon
general
hooker
without
regard
to
general
sedgwick
twenty
thousand
troops
inspired
by
recent
victory
would
have
resulted
probably
in
disaster
these
comments
may
detract
from
that
praise
of
audacity
accorded
to
lee
in
making
this
movement
it
seems
rather
to
have
been
the
dictate
of
to
have
advanced
upon
general
hooker
would
have
been
the
audacity
it
was
thus
necessary
to
defer
the
final
blow
at
the
main
federal
army
in
his
front
and
general
lee
promptly
detached
a
force
of
about
five
brigades
to
meet
general
sedgwick
which
with
early
command
now
in
rear
of
the
federal
column
would
it
was
supposed
suffice
this
body
moved
speedily
down
the
turnpike
to
check
the
enemy
and
encountered
the
head
of
his
column
about
near
salem
church
general
wilcox
who
had
been
sent
by
lee
to
watch
banks
ford
had
already
moved
to
bar
the
federal
advance
when
the
brigades
sent
by
lee
joined
him
the
whole
force
formed
line
of
battle
a
brisk
action
ensued
continuing
from
about
four
in
the
afternoon
until
nightfall
when
the
fighting
ceased
and
general
sedgwick
made
no
further
attempt
to
advance
on
that
day
these
events
took
place
as
we
have
said
on
sunday
afternoon
the
day
of
the
federal
defeat
at
chancellorsville
on
monday
morning
may
the
theatre
of
action
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
rappahannock
presented
a
very
remarkable
complication
general
early
had
been
driven
from
the
ridge
at
fredericksburg
but
no
sooner
had
general
sedgwick
marched
toward
chancellorsville
than
early
returned
and
seized
upon
marye
heights
again
he
was
thus
in
general
rear
and
ready
to
prevent
him
from
recrossing
the
rappahannock
at
fredericksburg
sedgwick
meanwhile
was
moving
to
assail
lee
flank
and
rear
and
lee
was
ready
to
attack
general
hooker
in
front
such
was
the
singular
entanglement
of
the
northern
and
southern
forces
on
monday
morning
after
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
what
the
result
was
to
be
the
hours
of
that
day
were
now
to
decide
lee
resolved
first
if
possible
to
crush
general
sedgwick
when
it
was
his
design
to
return
and
make
a
decisive
assault
upon
general
hooker
in
accordance
with
this
plan
he
on
monday
morning
went
in
personal
command
of
three
brigades
of
anderson
division
reached
the
vicinity
of
salem
church
and
proceeded
to
form
line
of
battle
with
the
whole
force
there
owing
to
unforeseen
delays
the
attack
was
not
begun
until
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
whole
line
advanced
upon
general
sedgwick
lee
aim
being
to
cut
him
off
from
the
river
in
this
he
failed
the
stubborn
resistance
of
the
federal
forces
enabling
them
to
hold
their
ground
until
night
at
that
time
however
they
seemed
to
waver
and
lose
heart
whether
from
receiving
intelligence
of
general
hooker
mishap
or
from
other
causes
is
not
known
they
were
now
pressed
by
the
southern
troops
and
finally
gave
way
general
sedgwick
retreated
rapidly
but
in
good
order
to
banks
ford
where
a
pontoon
had
been
fortunately
laid
and
this
enabled
him
to
cross
his
men
the
passage
was
effected
under
cover
of
darkness
the
southern
cannon
firing
upon
the
retreating
column
and
with
this
ended
the
movement
of
general
sedgwick
on
tuesday
morning
lee
returned
with
his
men
toward
chancellorsville
and
during
the
whole
day
was
busily
engaged
in
preparation
for
a
decisive
attack
upon
general
hooker
on
the
next
morning
when
however
the
southern
felt
their
way
at
daylight
toward
the
federal
position
it
was
found
that
the
works
were
entirely
deserted
general
hooker
had
recrossed
the
river
spreading
on
the
pontoon
bridge
to
muffle
the
sound
of
his
so
the
great
advance
ended
vii
lee
generalship
and
personal
demeanor
during
the
campaign
the
movements
of
the
two
armies
in
the
chancellorsville
campaign
as
it
is
generally
styled
have
been
so
fully
described
in
the
foregoing
pages
that
little
comment
upon
them
is
here
necessary
the
main
feature
which
attracts
attention
in
surveying
the
whole
series
of
operations
is
the
boldness
amounting
to
apparent
recklessness
of
lee
and
first
the
excellent
generalship
and
then
the
extraordinary
tissue
of
military
errors
of
general
hooker
up
to
the
of
may
when
he
emerged
from
the
chancellorsville
thicket
every
thing
had
succeeded
with
the
federal
commander
and
deserved
to
succeed
he
had
successfully
brought
over
his
great
force
which
he
himself
described
as
the
finest
army
on
the
planet
and
occupied
strong
ground
east
of
chancellorsville
on
the
road
to
fredericksburg
general
sedgwick
was
absent
at
the
latter
place
with
a
strong
detachment
of
the
army
but
the
main
body
covered
banks
ford
but
twelve
miles
from
the
city
and
by
the
afternoon
of
this
day
the
whole
army
might
have
been
concentrated
then
the
fate
of
lee
would
seem
to
have
been
decided
he
had
not
only
a
very
small
army
but
that
army
was
scattered
and
liable
to
be
cut
off
in
detail
general
sedgwick
menaced
his
right
at
fredericksburg
general
hooker
was
in
front
of
his
left
near
chancellorsville
and
to
crush
one
of
these
wings
before
the
other
could
come
to
its
assistance
seemed
a
work
of
no
very
great
difficulty
general
hooker
appears
however
to
have
distrusted
his
ability
to
effect
this
result
and
finding
that
general
lee
was
advancing
with
his
main
body
to
attack
him
retired
from
his
strong
position
in
the
open
country
to
the
dense
thicket
around
chancellorsville
that
this
was
a
grave
military
error
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
by
this
retrograde
movement
general
hooker
not
only
discouraged
his
troops
who
had
been
elated
by
his
confident
and
inspiring
general
orders
but
lost
the
great
advantage
of
the
open
country
where
his
large
force
could
be
successfully
manoeuvred
lee
took
instant
advantage
of
this
fault
in
his
adversary
and
boldly
pressed
the
force
retiring
into
the
wilderness
where
on
the
night
of
the
of
may
general
hooker
was
shut
up
with
his
army
this
unforeseen
result
presented
the
adversaries
now
in
an
entirely
new
light
the
federal
army
which
had
been
promised
by
its
commander
a
speedy
march
upon
richmond
in
pursuit
of
lee
had
instead
of
advancing
made
a
backward
movement
and
lee
who
it
had
been
supposed
would
retreat
was
now
following
and
offering
them
battle
the
daring
resolution
of
lee
to
divide
his
army
and
attack
the
federal
right
followed
it
would
seem
unjust
to
general
hooker
greatly
to
blame
him
for
the
success
of
that
blow
which
could
not
have
been
reasonably
anticipated
in
determining
upon
this
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
movements
of
the
war
general
lee
proceeded
in
defiance
of
military
rules
and
was
only
justified
in
his
course
by
the
desperate
character
of
the
situation
of
affairs
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
impression
upon
general
hooker
front
or
left
owing
to
the
elaborate
defences
in
both
quarters
it
was
therefore
necessary
either
to
retire
or
attack
in
a
different
direction
as
a
retreat
however
upon
richmond
would
have
surrendered
to
the
enemy
a
large
and
fertile
tract
of
country
it
was
desirable
if
possible
to
avoid
that
alternative
and
the
attack
on
the
federal
right
followed
the
results
of
this
were
truly
extraordinary
the
force
routed
and
driven
back
in
disorder
by
general
jackson
was
but
a
single
corps
and
that
corps
it
is
said
not
a
legitimate
part
of
the
old
army
of
the
potomac
but
the
disorder
seems
to
have
communicated
itself
to
the
whole
army
and
to
have
especially
discouraged
general
hooker
in
describing
the
scene
in
question
we
refrained
from
dwelling
upon
the
full
extent
of
the
confusion
into
which
the
federal
forces
were
thrown
some
sentences
taken
from
northern
accounts
may
lead
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
result
after
jackson
assault
a
northern
historian
says
the
open
plain
around
chancellorsville
presented
such
a
spectacle
as
a
simoom
sweeping
over
the
desert
might
make
through
the
dusk
of
nightfall
a
rushing
whirlwind
of
men
and
artillery
and
wagons
swept
down
the
road
past
headquarters
and
on
toward
the
fords
of
the
rappahannock
and
it
was
in
vain
that
the
staff
opposed
their
persons
and
drawn
sabres
to
the
fugitives
another
writer
an
says
the
spectacle
presented
was
that
of
solid
columns
of
infantry
retreating
at
a
dense
mass
of
beings
flying
hundreds
of
left
riderless
at
the
first
discharge
from
the
rebels
dashing
frantically
about
in
all
directions
scores
of
batteries
flying
from
the
field
ambulances
horses
men
cannon
caissons
all
jumbled
and
tumbled
together
in
one
inextricable
mass
the
stampede
universal
the
disgrace
general
after
all
however
it
was
but
one
corps
of
the
federal
army
which
had
been
thus
thrown
into
disorder
and
general
hooker
had
no
valid
grounds
for
distrusting
his
ability
to
defeat
lee
in
a
more
decisive
action
there
are
many
reasons
for
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
he
did
from
that
moment
distrust
his
powers
he
had
courageously
hastened
to
the
assailed
point
ordering
the
men
to
throw
themselves
into
the
breach
and
receive
jackson
troops
on
the
bayonet
but
after
this
display
of
soldierly
resolution
general
hooker
appears
to
have
lost
some
of
that
nerve
which
should
never
desert
a
soldier
and
on
the
same
night
sent
engineers
to
trace
out
a
new
line
of
defences
in
his
rear
to
which
it
seems
he
already
contemplated
the
probability
of
being
forced
to
retire
why
he
came
to
take
this
depressed
view
of
the
situation
of
affairs
it
is
difficult
to
say
one
of
general
sedgwick
corps
reached
him
on
this
night
and
his
force
at
chancellorsville
still
amounted
to
between
ninety
and
one
hundred
thousand
men
about
thrice
that
of
lee
no
decisive
trial
of
strength
had
yet
taken
place
between
the
two
armies
and
yet
the
larger
force
was
constructing
defences
in
rear
to
protect
them
from
the
smaller
a
circumstance
not
tending
it
would
seem
to
greatly
encourage
the
troops
whose
commander
was
thus
providing
for
a
safe
retreat
the
subsequent
order
to
general
sedgwick
to
march
up
from
fredericksburg
and
assail
lee
right
was
judicious
and
really
saved
the
army
from
a
great
disaster
lee
was
about
to
follow
up
the
discouraged
forces
of
general
hooker
as
they
fell
back
toward
the
river
and
as
the
southern
army
was
flushed
with
victory
the
surrender
of
the
great
body
might
have
ensued
this
possible
result
was
prevented
by
the
flank
movement
of
general
sedgwick
and
some
gratitude
for
assistance
so
important
from
his
able
lieutenant
would
have
seemed
natural
and
graceful
in
general
hooker
this
view
of
the
subject
does
not
seem
however
to
have
been
taken
by
the
federal
commander
he
subsequently
charged
the
defeat
of
chancellorsville
upon
general
sedgwick
who
he
declared
had
failed
in
a
prompt
compliance
with
his
orders
the
facts
do
not
bear
out
this
charge
as
the
reader
has
seen
general
sedgwick
received
the
order
toward
midnight
on
saturday
and
at
eleven
on
sunday
morning
had
passed
over
that
stubborn
stone
wall
which
in
the
battle
of
the
preceding
december
general
hooker
column
had
not
even
been
able
to
reach
had
stormed
marye
hill
which
general
hooker
had
described
in
vindication
of
his
own
failure
to
carry
the
position
as
masonry
a
fortification
and
a
mountain
of
rock
and
had
marched
thereafter
so
promptly
as
to
force
lee
in
his
own
defence
to
arrest
the
second
advance
upon
the
federal
main
body
and
divert
a
considerable
force
to
meet
the
attack

his
flank

this

valuable

the
explanation
of
many
interesting
questions
after
the
repulse
of
general
sedgwick
and
his
retreat
across
the
rappahannock
general
hooker
seems
to
have
been
completely
discouraged
and
hastened
to
put
the
river
between
himself
and
lee

losses
in
the
battles
of
saturday
and

amounted
to
seventeen

contrary
to
the
ordinary
course
of
things
the
assailing
force
had
lost
a
less
number
of

than
that
assailed
the
foregoing
reflections
which
necessarily
involve
a
criticism
of
general
hooker
arise
naturally
from
a
review
of
the
events
of
the
campaign
and
seem
justified
by
the
circumstances
there
can
be
no
inducement
for
the
present
writer
to
underrate
the
military
ability
of
the
federal
commander
as
that
want
of
ability
rather
detracts
from
than
adds
to
the
merit
of
general
lee
in
defeating
him
it
may
be
said
indeed
that
without
these
errors
and
shortcomings
of
general
hooker
lee
humanly
speaking
must
have
been
either
defeated
or
forced
to
retire
upon
richmond
after
giving
full
weight
however
to
all
the
advantages
derived
from
the
extraordinary
federal
oversights
and
mistakes
general
lee
merit
in
this
campaign
was
greater
perhaps
than
in
any
other
during
his
entire
career
had
he
left
behind
him
no
other
record
than
this
it
alone
would
have
been
sufficient
to
have
conferred
upon
him
the
first
glories
of
arms
and
handed
his
name
down
to
posterity
as
that
of
one
of
the
greatest
soldiers
of
history
it
is
difficult
to
discover
a
single
error
committed
by
him
in
the
whole
series
of
movements
from
the
moment
when
general
sedgwick
crossed
at
fredericksburg
to
the
time
of
general
hooker
retreat
beyond
the
rappahannock
it
may
appear
that
there
was
unnecessary
delay
in
permitting
tuesday
to
pass
without
a
final
advance
upon
general
hooker
in
his
second
line
of
intrenchments
but
no
doubt
many
circumstances
induced
lee
to
defer
this
attack
the
fatigue
of
his
troops
consequent
upon
the
fighting
of
the
four
preceding
days
friday
saturday
sunday
and
monday
the
necessity
of
reforming
his
battalions
for
the
final
blow
and
the
anticipation
that
general
hooker
who
still
had
at
his
command
a
force
of
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
men
would
not
so
promptly
relinquish
his
campaign
and
retire
with
the
exception
of
this
error
if
it
be
such
lee
had
made
no
single
false
step
in
the
whole
of
his
movements
the
campaign
was
round
perfect
and
complete
such
as
a
student
of
the
art
of
war
might
pore
over
and
analyze
as
an
instance
of
the
greatest
principles
of
military
science
clothed
in
act
the
most
striking
features
of
lee
movements
were
their
rapidity
and
audacity
it
had
been
the
fashion
with
some
persons
to
speak
of
lee
as
slow
and
cautious
in
his
operations
and
this
criticism
had
not
been
completely
silenced
even
in
the
winter
of
when
his
failure
to
crush
general
burnside
afforded
his
detractors
another
opportunity
of
repeating
the
old
charge
after
the
chancellorsville
campaign
these
were
silenced
no
one
could
be
found
to
listen
to
them
the
whole
southern
movement
completely
contradicted
their
theory
at
the
first
intelligence
of
the
advance
of
general
hooker
main
body
across
the
upper
rappahannock
lee
rode
rapidly
in
that
direction
and
ordered
his
troops
at
the
fords
of
the
river
to
fall
back
to
chancellorsville
he
then
returned
and
finding
that
general
sedgwick
had
crossed
at
fredericksburg
held
a
prompt
consultation
with
jackson
when
it
was
decided
at
once
to
concentrate
the
main
body
of
the
army
in
front
of
general
hooker
column

the
word
jackson

on
the
of

pressed

the
his
right

crushed
and
his
army
thrown
into
confusion
on
the
he
was
driven
from
chancellorsville
and
but
for
the
flank
movement
of
general
sedgwick
which
lee
was
not
in
sufficient
force
to
prevent
general
hooker
would
upon
that
same
day
sunday
have
in
all
probability
suffered
a
decisive
defeat
in
the
course
of
four
days
lee
had
thus
advanced
and
checked
and
then
attacked
and
repulsed
with
heavy
slaughter
an
army
thrice
as
large
as
his
own
on
the
last
day
of
april
he
had
been
nearly
enveloped
by
a
host
of
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
men
on
the
day
of
may
their
main
body
was
in
disorderly
retreat
and
at
daylight
on
the
morning
of
the
there
was
not
a
federal
soldier
with
the
exception
of
the
prisoners
taken
on
the
southern
bank
of
the
rappahannock
during
all
these
critical
scenes
when
the
fate
of
the
confederate
capital
and
possibly
of
the
southern
cause
hung
suspended
in
the
balance
general
lee
preserved
as
thousands
of
persons
can
testify
the
most
admirable
serenity
and
composure
without
that
jubilant
confidence
displayed
by
general
hooker
in
his
address
to
the
troops
and
the
exclamations
to
his
officers
lee
was
equally
free
from
gloom
or
any
species
of
depression
his
spirits
seemed
to
rise
under
the
pressure
upon
him
and
at
times
he
was
almost
gay
when
one
of
general
jackson
aides
hastened
into
his
tent
near
fredericksburg
and
with
great
animation
informed
him
that
the
enemy
were
crossing
the
river
in
heavy
force
in
his
front
he
seemed
to
be
amused
by
that
circumstance
and
said
smiling
well
i
firing
and
i
was
beginning
to
think
it
was
time
some
of
you
lazy
young
fellows
were
coming
to
tell
me
what
it
was
all
about
say
to
general
jackson
that
he
knows
just
as
well
what
to
do
with
the
enemy
as
i
do
the
who
could
find
time
at
such
a
moment
to
indulge
in
must
have
possessed
excellent
nerve
and
this
composure
mingled
with
a
certain
buoyant
hopefulness
as
of
one
sure
of
the
event
remained
with
lee
throughout
the
whole
great
wrestle
with
general
hooker
he
retained
to
the
end
his
simple
and
quiet
manner
divested
of
every
thing
like
excitement
in
the
consultation
with
jackson
on
the
night
of
the
of
may
when
the
crisis
was
so
critical
his
demeanor
indicated
no
anxiety
and
when
as
we
have
said
the
news
came
of
jackson
wound
he
said
simply
sit
down
here
by
me
captain
and
tell
me
all
about
the
fight
last
evening
adding
ah
captain
any
victory
is
dearly
bought
which
deprives
us
of
the
services
of
general
jackson
even
for
a
short
time
do
talk
about
it
thank
god
it
is
no
worse
the
turns
of
expression
here
are
those
of
a
person
who
permits
nothing
to
disturb
his
serenity
and
indulges
his
gentler
and
tenderer
feelings
even
in
the
hot
atmosphere
of
a
great
conflict
the
picture
presented
is
surely
an
interesting
and
beautiful
one
the
human
being
who
uttered
the
criticism
at
the
expense
of
the
lazy
young
fellows
and
who
greeted
the
news
of
jackson
misfortune
with
a
sigh
as
tender
as
that
of
a
woman
was
the
soldier
who
had
seized
the
masses
of
his
force
with
the
grasp
of
a
titan
and
swung
them
into
position
as
a
giant
might
fling
a
mighty
stone
to
general
hooker
threat
to
crush
him
he
had
responded
by
crushing
general
hooker
nearly
surrounded
by
the
huge
cordon
of
the
federal
army
he
had
cut
the
cordon
and
emerged
in
safety
general
hooker
with
his
one
hundred
thousand
men
had
retreated
to
the
north
bank
of
the
rappahannock
and
on
the
south
bank
lee
with
his
thirty
thousand
remained
erect
threatening
and
triumphant
we
have
not
presented
in
these
pages
the
orders
of
lee
on
various
occasions
as
these
papers
are
for
the
most
part
of
an
official
character
and
not
of
great
interest
to
the
general
reader
we
shall
however
occasionally
present
these
documents
and
here
lay
before
the
reader
the
orders
of
both
general
hooker
and
general
lee
after
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
giving
precedence
to
the
former
the
order
of
the
federal
commander
was
as
follows
headquarters
army
of
the
potomac
the
commanding
tenders
to
this
army
his
congratulations
on
its
achievements
of
the
last
seven
days
if
it
has
not
accomplished
all
that
was
expected
the
reasons
are
well
known
to
the
army
it
is
sufficient
to
say
they
were
of
a
character
not
to
be
foreseen
or
prevented
by
human
sagacity
or
resources
in
withdrawing
from
the
south
bank
of
the
rappahannock
before
delivering
a
general
battle
to
our
adversaries
the
army
has
given
renewed
evidence
in
its
confidence
in
itself
and
its
fidelity
to
the
principles
it
represents
by
fighting
at
a
disadvantage
we
would
have
been
recreant
to
our
trust
to
ourselves
to
our
cause
and
to
our
country
profoundly
loyal
and
conscious
of
its
strength
the
army
of
the
potomac
will
give
or
decline
battle
whenever
its
interests
or
honor
may
command
it
by
the
celerity
and
secrecy
of
our
movements
our
advance
and
passage
of
the
river
were
undisputed
and
on
our
withdrawal
not
a
rebel
dared
to
follow
us
the
events
of
the
last
week
may
well
cause
the
heart
of
every
officer
and
soldier
of
the
army
to
swell
with
pride
we
have
added
new
laurels
to
our
former
renown
we
have
made
long
marches
crossed
rivers
surprised
the
enemy
in
his
intrenchments
and
whenever
we
have
fought
we
have
inflicted
heavier
blows
than
those
we
have
received
we
have
taken
from
the
enemy
five
thousand
prisoners
and
fifteen
colors
captured
seven
pieces
of
artillery
and
placed
de
eighteen
thousand
of
our
foe
chosen
troops
we
have
destroyed
his
depots
filled
with
vast
amounts
of
stores
damaged
his
communications
captured
prisoners
within
the
fortifications
of
his
capital
and
filled
his
country
with
fear
and
consternation
we
have
no
other
regret
than
that
caused
by
the
loss
of
our
brave
companions
and
in
this
we
are
consoled
by
the
conviction
that
they
have
fallen
in
the
holiest
cause
ever
submitted

to

his

the
heroic

during
the
arduous
operations
in
which
they
have

been
engaged

and
while
we
mourn
their
loss
let
us
resolve
to
emulate
their
noble
example
the

alike
lament
the

they

i
have
received
your

and
reverently
unite
with
you
in
giving
praise
to

for

viii
personal
relations
of
lee
and
jackson
the
most
important
incident
of
the
great
battle
of
chancellorsville
was
the
fall
of
jackson
the
services
of
this
illustrious
soldier
had
now
become
almost
indispensable
to
general
lee
who
spoke
of
him
as
his
right
arm
and
the
had
so
long
been
accustomed
to
lean
upon
the
strong
shoulder
of
his
lieutenant
that
now
when
this
support
was
withdrawn
he
seems
to
have
felt
the
loss
of
it
profoundly
in
the
war
indeed
there
had
arisen
no
soldier
who
so
powerfully
drew
the
public
eye
as
jackson
in
the
opinion
of
many
persons
he
was
a
greater
and
abler
commander
than
lee
himself
and
although
such
an
opinion
will
not
be
found
to
stand
after
a
full
review
of
the
characters
and
careers
of
the
two
leaders
there
was
sufficient
ground
for
it
to
induce
many
fair
and
intelligent
persons
to
adopt
it
jackson
had
been
almost
uniformly
successful
he
had
conducted
to
a
triumphant
issue
the
arduous
campaign
of
the
valley
where
he
was
opposed
in
nearly
every
battle
by
a
force
much
larger
than
his
own
and
these
victories
in
a
quarter
so
important
and
at
a
moment
so
critical
had
come
borne
on
the
wind
of
the
mountain
to
electrify
and
inspire
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
richmond
and
the
entire
confederacy
jackson
rapid
march
and
assault
on
general
right
on
the
chickahominy
had
followed
he
then
advanced
northward
defeated
the
vanguard
of
the
enemy
at
cedar
mountain
led
the
great
column
of
lee
against
the
rear
of
general
pope
destroyed
manassas
held
his
ground
until
lee
arrived
and
bore
an
important
part
in
the
battle
which
ensued
thence
he
had
passed
to
maryland
fallen
upon
harper
ferry
and
captured
it
returned
to
fight
with
lee
at
sharpsburg
and
in
that
battle
had
borne
the
brunt
of
the
enemy
main
assault
with
an
unbroken
front
that
the
result
was
a
drawn
battle
and
not
a
southern
defeat
was
due
to
lee
generalship
and
fighting
the
retrograde
movement
to
the
lowland
followed
and
jackson
was
left
in
the
valley
to
embarrass
mcclellan
advance
in
this
he
perfectly
succeeded
and
then
suddenly
reappeared
at
fredericksburg
where
he
received
and
repulsed
one
of
the
two
great
assaults
of
the
enemy
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
followed
and
lee
statement
of
the
part
borne
in
this
hard
combat
by
jackson
has
been
given
the
result
was
due
he
said
not
to
his
own
generalship
but
to
the
skill
and
energy
of
his
lieutenant
whose
congratulations
he
refused
to
receive
declaring
that
the
victory
was
jackson
here
had
at
last
ended
the
long
series
of
nearly
unbroken
victories
jackson
had
become
the
of
lee
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
the
sense
of
loss
felt
by
the
in
addition
to
this
natural
sentiment
was
deep
regret
at
the
death
of
one
personally
dear
to
him
and
to
whom
he
was
himself
an
object
of
almost
reverent
love
the
personal
relations
of
lee
and
jackson
had
from
first
to
last
remained
the
same
not
the
slightest
cloud
had
ever
arisen
to
disturb
the
perfect
union
in
each
of
admiration
and
affection
for
the
other
it
had
never
occurred
to
these
two
great
soldiers
to
ask
what
their
relative
position
was
in
the
public
eye
which
was
most
spoken
of
and
commended
or
admired
human
nature
is
weak
at
best
and
the
fame
of
jackson
mounting
to
its
dazzling
zenith
might
have
disturbed
a
less
magnanimous
soul
than
lee
there
is
not
however
the
slightest
reason
to
believe
that
lee
ever
gave
the
subject
a
thought
entirely
free
from
that
vulgar
species
of
ambition
which
looks
with
cold
eyes
upon
the
success
of
others
as
offensive
to
its
own
lee
never
seems
to
have
instituted
any
comparison
between
himself
and
jackson
greeted
praise
of
his
famous
lieutenant
with
sincere
pleasure
and
was
the
first
upon
every
occasion
not
only
to
express
the
fullest
sense
of
assistance
and
the
warmest
admiration
of
his
genius
as
a
soldier
but
to
attribute
to
him
as
after
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
the
merit
of
every
description
it
is
not
possible
to
contemplate
this
august
affection
and
admiration
of
the
two
soldiers
for
each
other
without
regarding
it
as
a
greater
glory
to
them
than
all
their
successes
in
arms
lee
opinion
of
jackson
and
personal
sentiment
toward
him
have
been
set
forth
in
the
above
sentences
the
sentiment
of
jackson
for
lee
was
as
strong
or
stronger
he
regarded
him
with
mingled
love
and
admiration
to
excite
such
feelings
in
a
man
like
jackson
it
was
necessary
that
lee
should
be
not
only
a
soldier
of
the
first
order
of
genius
but
also
a
good
and
pious
man
it
was
in
these
lights
that
jackson
regarded
his
commander
and
from
first
to
last
his
confidence
in
and
admiration
for
him
never
wavered
he
had
defended
lee
from
the
criticism
of
unskilled
or
ignorant
persons
from
the
time
when
he
assumed
command
of
the
army
in
the
summer
of
at
that
time
some
one
spoke
of
lee
in
jackson
presence
as
slow
the
criticism
aroused
the
indignation
of
the
silent
soldier
and
he
exclaimed
general
lee
is
no
one
knows
the
weight
upon
his
heart
his
great
responsibilities
he
is
and
he
knows
that
if
an
army
is
lost
it
can
not
be
replaced
no
there
may
be
some
persons
whose
good
opinion
of
me
may
make
them
attach
some
weight
to
my
views
and
if
you
ever
hear
that
said
of
general
lee
i
beg
you
will
contradict
it
in
my
name
i
have
known
general
lee
for
years
he
is
cautious
he
ought
to
be
but
he
is
lee
is
a
phenomenon
he
is
the
only
man
whom
i
would
follow
blindfold
the
abrupt
and
energetic
expressions
of
jackson
on
this
occasion
indicate
his
profound
sense
of
the
injustice
done
lee
by
these
criticisms
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
stronger
statement
than
that
here
made
by
him
it
will
be
conceded
that
he
himself
was
competent
to
estimate
soldiership
and
in
jackson
eyes
lee
was
a
phenomenon
the
only
man
whom
he
would
follow
blindfold
the
subsequent
career
of
lee
seems
to
have
strengthened
and
intensified
this
extreme
admiration
what
lee
advised
or
did
was
always
in
jackson
eyes
the
very
best
that
could
be
suggested
or
performed
he
yielded
his
own
opinions
upon
every
occasion
with
perfect
readiness
and
cheerfulness
to
those
of
lee
as
to
the
loved
him
revered
him
looked
up
to
him
and
never
seems
to
have
found
fault
with
him
but
upon
one
occasion
when
he
received
lee
note
of
congratulation
after
chancellorsville
he
then
said
general
lee
is
very
kind
but
he
should
give
the
glory
to
god
this
affection
and
admiration
were
fully
returned
by
general
lee
who
consulted
jackson
upon
every
occasion
and
confided
in
him
as
his
personal
friend
there
was
seldom
any
question
between
them
of
superior
and
subordinate
never
except
when
the
exigency
required
that
the
decision
should
be
made
by
lee
as
jackson
supreme
genius
indeed
made
this
course
natural
and
no
further
praise
is
due
lee
in
this
particular
save
that
of
modesty
and
good
sense
but
these
qualities
are
commendable
and
not
universal
he
committed
the
greatest
undertakings
to
jackson
with
the
utmost
confidence
certain
that
he
would
do
all
that
could
be
done
and
some
words
of
his
quoted
above
express
this
entire
confidence
say
to
general
jackson
he
replied
to
the
young
at
fredericksburg
that
he
knows
just
as
well
what
to
do
with
the
enemy
as
i
do
lee
personal
affection
was
strikingly
displayed
after
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
when
jackson
lay
painfully
but
no
one
supposed
mortally
wounded
first
at
wilderness
tavern
and
then
at
ginney
prevented
from
visiting
the
wounded
man
by
the
responsibilities
of
command
now
all
the
greater
from
jackson
absence
and
not
regarding
his
hurt
as
serious
as
indeed
it
did
not
appear
to
be
until
toward
the
last
lee
sent
him
continual
messages
containing
good
wishes
and
inquiries
after
his
health
the
tone
of
these
messages
is
very
familiar
and
affectionate
and
leaves
no
doubt
of
the
character
of
the
relations
between
the
two
men
give
him
my
affectionate
regards
he
said
to
one
officer
and
tell
him
to
make
haste
and
get
well
and
come
back
to
me
as
soon
as
he
can
he
has
lost
his
left
arm
but
i
have
lost
my
right
when
the
wound
of
the
great
soldier
took
a
bad
turn
and
it
began
to
be
whispered
about
that
the
hurt
might
prove
fatal
lee
was
strongly
moved
and
said
with
deep
feeling
surely
general
jackson
must
recover
god
will
not
take
him
from
us
now
that
we
need
him
so
much
surely
he
will
be
spared
to
us
in
answer
to
the
many
prayers
which
are
offered
for
him
he
paused
after
uttering
these
words
laboring
evidently
under
very
deep
and
painful
emotion
after
remaining
silent
for
some
moments
he
added
when
you
return
i
trust
you
will
find
him
better
when
a
suitable
occasion
offers
give
him
my
love
and
tell
him
that
i
wrestled
in
prayer
for
him
last
night
as
i
never
prayed
i
believe
for
myself
the
tone
of
these
messages
is
as
we
have
said
that
of
familiar
affection
as
from
one
valued
friend
to
another
the
expression
give
him
my
love
is
a
virginianism
which
is
used
only
when
two
persons
are
closely
and
firmly
bound
by
long
association
and
friendship
such
had
been
the
case
with
lee
and
jackson
and
in
the
annals
of
the
war
there
is
no
other
instance
of
a
friendship
so
close
affectionate
and
unalloyed
jackson
died
on
the
of
may
and
the
unexpected
intelligence
shocked
lee
profoundly
he
mourned
the
death
of
the
illustrious
soldier
with
a
sorrow
too
deep
almost
to
find
relief
in
tears
and
issued
a
general
order
to
the
troops
which
was
in
the
following
words
with
deep
grief
the
commanding
general
announces
to
the
army
the
death
of
jackson
who
expired
on
the
at
three
the
daring
skill
and
energy
of
this
great
and
good
soldier
by
the
decree
of
an
providence
are
now
lost
to
us
but
while
we
mourn
his
death
we
feel
that
his
spirit
still
lives
and
will
inspire
the
whole
army
with
his
indomitable
courage
and
unshaken
confidence
in
god
as
our
hope
and
strength
let
his
name
be
a
watchword
to
his
corps
who
have
followed
him
to
victory
on
so
many
fields
let
his
officers
and
soldiers
emulate
his
invincible
determination
to
do
every
thing
in
defence
of
our
beloved
country
lee
it
is
probable
that
the
composition
of
this
order
cost
general
lee
one
of
the
severest
pangs
he
ever
experienced
ix
circumstances
leading
to
the
invasion
of
pennsylvania
the
defeat
of
general
hooker
at
chancellorsville
was
the
of
the
war
and
for
the
first
time
there
was
apparently
a
possibility
of
inducing
the
federal
government
to
relinquish
its
opposition
to
the
establishment
of
a
separate
authority
in
the
south
the
idea
of
the
formation
of
a
southern
confederacy
distinct
from
the
old
union
had
up
to
this
time
been
repudiated
by
the
authorities
at
washington
as
a
thing
utterly
out
of
the
question
but
the
defeat
of
the
federal
arms
in
the
two
great
battles
of
the
rappahannock
had
caused
the
most
determined
opponents
of
separation
to
doubt
whether
the
south
could
be
coerced
to
return
to
the
union
and
what
was
equally
or
more
important
the
proclamations
of
president
lincoln
declaring
the
slaves
of
the
south
free
and
placing
the
united
states
virtually
under
martial
law
aroused
a
violent
clamor
from
the
great
democratic
party
of
the
north
who
loudly
asserted
that
all
constitutional
liberty
was
disappearing
this
combination
of
in
military
affairs
and
usurpation
by
the
government
emboldened
the
advocates
of
peace
to
speak
out
plainly
and
utter
their
protest
against
the
continuance
of
the
struggle
which
they
declared
had
only
resulted
in
the
prostration
of
all
the
liberties
of
the
country
journals
and
periodicals
violently
denunciatory
of
the
course
pursued
by
the
government
all
at
once
made
their
appearance
in
new
york
and
elsewhere
a
peace
convention
was
called
to
meet
in
philadelphia
vallandigham
nominee
of
the
democratic
party
for
governor
of
ohio
eloquently
denounced
the
whole
policy
of
endeavoring
to
subjugate
the
sovereign
states
of
the
south
and
judge
curtis
of
boston
formerly
associate
judge
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
published
a
pamphlet
in
which
the
federal
president
was
stigmatized
as
a
usurper
and
tyrant
i
do
not
see
wrote
judge
curtis
that
it
depends
upon
the
executive
decree
whether
a
servile
war
shall
be
invoked
to
help
twenty
millions
of
the
white
race
to
assert
the
rightful
authority
of
the
constitution
and
laws
of
their
country
over
those
who
refuse
to
obey
them
but
i
do
see
that
this
proclamation
emancipating
the
southern
slaves
asserts
the
power
of
the
executive
to
make
such
a
decree
i
do
not
perceive
how
it
is
that
my
neighbors
and
myself
residing
remote
from
armies
and
their
operations
and
where
all
the
laws
of
the
land
may
be
enforced
by
constitutional
means
should
be
subjected
to
the
possibility
of
arrest
and
imprisonment
and
trial
before
a
military
commission
and
punishment
at
its
discretion
for
offences
unknown
to
the
law
a
possibility
to
be
converted
into
a
fact
at
the
mere
will
of
the
president
or
of
some
subordinate
officer
clothed
by
him
with
this
power
but
i
do
perceive
that
this
executive
power
is
asserted
it
must
be
obvious
to
the
meanest
capacity
that
if
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
an
constitutional
right
as
of
the
army
and
navy
in
time
of
war
to
disregard
any
one
positive
prohibition
of
the
constitution
or
to
exercise
any
one
power
not
delegated
to
the
united
states
by
the
constitution
because
in
his
judgment
he
may
thereby
subdue
the
enemy
he
has
the
same
right
for
the
same
reason
to
disregard
each
and
every
provision
of
the
constitution
and
to
exercise
all
power
in
his
to
enable
him
to
subdue
the
enemy
the
time
has
certainly
come
when
the
people
of
the
united
states
understand
and
apply
those
great
rules
of
civil
liberty
which
have
been
arrived
at
by
the
efforts
of
thought
and
action
of
their
ancestors
during
seven
hundred
years
of
struggle
against
arbitrary
power
so
far
had
reached
the
thunder
of
lee
guns
at
chancellorsville
their
roar
seemed
to
have
awakened
throughout
the
entire
north
the
great
party
hitherto
lulled
to
slumber
by
the
plea
of
military
necessity
or
paralyzed
by
the
very
extent
of
the
executive
usurpation
which
they
saw
but
had
not
had
heart
to
oppose
on
all
sides
the
advocates
of
peace
on
the
basis
of
separation
were
heard
raising
their
importunate
voices
and
in
the
north
the
hearts
of
the
people
began
to
thrill
with
the
anticipation
of
a
speedy
termination
of
the
bloody
and
exhausting
struggle
the
occasion
was
embraced
by
stephens
of
the
confederate
states
to
propose
negotiations
this
able
gentleman
wrote
from
georgia
on
the
of
june
to
president
davis
offering
to
go
to
washington
and
sound
the
authorities
there
on
the
subject
of
peace
he
believed
that
the
moment
was
propitious
and
wished
to
act
before
further
military
movements
were
undertaken
especially
before
any
further
projects
of
invasion
by
lee
which
would
tend
he
thought
to
silence
the
peace
party
at
the
north
and
again
arouse
the
war
spirit
the
letter
of
stephens
was
written
on
the
of
june
and
president
davis
responded
by
telegraph
a
few
days
afterward
requesting
stephens
to
come
to
richmond
he
reached
that
city
on
the
or
of
june
but
by
that
time
lee
vanguard
was
entering
maryland
and
gettysburg
speedily
followed
which
terminated
all
hopes
of
peace
the
plan
of
moving
the
southern
army
northward
with
the
view
of
invading
the
federal
territory
seems
to
have
been
the
result
of
many
circumstances
the
country
was
elated
with
the
two
great
victories
of
fredericksburg
and
chancellorsville
and
the
people
were
clamorous
for
active
operations
against
an
enemy
who
seemed
powerless
to
stand
the
pressure
of
southern
steel
the
army
which
had
been
largely
augmented
by
the
return
of
absentees
to
its
ranks
new
levies
and
the
recall
of
longstreet
two
divisions
from
suffolk
shared
the
general
enthusiasm
and
thus
a
very
heavy
pressure
was
brought
to
bear
upon
the
authorities
and
on
general
lee
in
favor
of
a
forward
movement
which
it
was
supposed
would
terminate
in
a
signal
victory
and
a
treaty
of
peace
lee
yielded
to
this
view
of
things
rather
than
urged
it
he
was
not
opposed
to
an
offensive
policy
and
seems
indeed
to
have
shared
the
opinion
of
jackson
that
the
scipio
africanus
policy
was
the
best
for
the
south
his
theory
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
had
been
that
the
true
policy
of
the
south
was
to
keep
the
enemy
as
far
as
possible
from
the
interior
fighting
on
the
frontier
or
on
federal
soil
if
possible
that
of
the
south
would
there
thus
be
protected
from
the
ravages
of
the
enemy
and
the
further
advantage
would
accrue
that
the
confederate
capital
richmond
would
at
all
times
be
safe
from
danger
this
was
an
important
consideration
as
events
subsequently
showed
as
long
as
the
enemy
were
held
at
north
of
the
rappahannock
richmond
with
her
of
railroads
connecting
with
every
part
of
the
south
was
safe
and
the
government
undisturbed
in
their
capital
remained
a
power
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
but
with
an
enemy
enveloping
the
city
and
threatening
her
lines
of
communication
the
tenure
of
the
place
by
the
government
was
uncertain
when
general
grant
finally
thus
enveloped
the
city
and
laid
hold
upon
the
railroads
lee
army
was
defeated
and
the
government
became
fugitive
which
alone
would
have
struck
a
mortal
blow
to
its
prestige
and
authority
it
was
to
arrive
at
these
results
which
his
sagacity
discerned
that
lee
always
advocated
such
movements
as
would
throw
back
the
enemy
and
drive
him
if
possible
from
the
soil
of
virginia
another
important
consideration
was
the
question
of
supplies
these
were
at
all
times
deficient
in
the
confederate
armies
and
it
was
obviously
the
best
policy
to
protect
as
much
territory
from
which
supplies
might
be
drawn
as
possible
more
than
ever
before
these
supplies
were
now
needed
and
when
general
lee
sent
in
may
or
june
a
requisition
for
rations
to
richmond
the
is
said
to
have
endorsed
upon
the
paper
if
general
lee
wishes
rations
let
him
seek
them
in
pennsylvania
the
considerations
here
stated
were
the
main
inducements
for
that
great
movement
northward
which
followed
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
the
army
and
country
were
enthusiastic
the
government
rather
followed
than
led
and
throughout
the
month
of
may
lee
was
busily
engaged
in
organizing
and
equipping
his
forces
for
the
decisive
advance
experience
had
now
dictated
many
alterations
and
improvements
in
the
army
it
was
divided
into
three
each
consisting
of
three
divisions
and
commanded
by
an
officer
with
the
rank
of
longstreet
remained
at
the
head
of
his
former
corps
ewell
succeeded
jackson
in
command
of
jackson
old
corps
and
hill
was
assigned
to
a
third
corps
made
up
of
portions
of
the
two
others
the
infantry
was
thus
rearranged
in
a
manner
to
increase
greatly
its
efficiency
and
the
artillery
arm
was
entirely
reorganized
the
old
system
of
assigning
one
or
more
batteries
or
battalions
to
each
division
or
corps
was
done
away
with
and
the
artillery
of
the
army
was
made
a
distinct
command
and
placed
under
general
pendleton
a
brave
and
energetic
officer
who
was
thenceforward
lee
chief
of
artillery
the
last
arm
the
cavalry
was
also
increased
in
efficiency
and
on
the
last
day
of
may
general
lee
had
the
satisfaction
of
finding
himself
in
command
of
a
and
army
of
thousand
three
hundred
and
bayonets
and
nearly
ten
thousand
cavalry
and
artillery
in
all
about
eighty
thousand
men
never
before
had
the
southern
army
had
present
for
duty
as
fighting
men
so
large
a
number
except
just
before
the
battles
on
the
chickahominy
there
was
however
this
great
difference
between
the
army
then
and
at
this
time
in
those
first
months
of
it
was
made
up
largely
of
raw
troops
who
had
never
heard
the
discharge
of
a
musket
in
their
lives
while
now
in
may
the
bulk
of
the
army
consisted
of
lee
veterans
men
who
had
followed
him
through
the
fire
of
manassas
sharpsburg
fredericksburg
and
chancellorsville
and
could
be
counted
on
to
effect
any
thing
not
absolutely
beyond
human
power
general
longstreet
conversing
after
the
war
with
a
gentleman
of
the
north
declared
as
much
the
army
at
that
time
he
said
was
in
a
condition
to
undertake
lee
plans
and
objects
the
great
game
of
chess
was
now
about
to
commence
and
taking
an
illustration
from
that
game
general
lee
is
reported
to
have
said
that
he
believed
he
would
swap
queens
that
is
advance
and
attempt
to
capture
the
city
of
washington
leaving
general
hooker
at
liberty
if
he
chose
so
to
do
to
seize
in
turn
upon
richmond
what
the
result
of
so
singular
a
manoeuvre
would
have
been
it
is
impossible
to
say
it
would
certainly
have
proved
one
of
the
strangest
incidents
of
a
war
fruitful
in
varied
and
shifting
events
such
a
plan
of
operations
however
if
ever
seriously
contemplated
by
lee
was
speedily
abandoned
he
nowhere
makes
mention
of
any
such
design
in
his
published
reports
and
he
probably
spoke
of
it
only
in
jest
his
real
aim
in
the
great
movement
now
about
to
commence
is
stated
with
brevity
and
reserve
then
absolutely
necessary
but
also
with
sufficient
clearness
in
his
official
report
the
position
of
the
enemy
opposite
fredericksburg
was
he
says
such
as
to
render
an
attack
upon
him
injudicious
it
was
therefore
desirable
to
manoeuvre
him
out
of
it
force
him
to
return
toward
maryland
and
thus
free
the
country
of
his
forces
a
further
result
was
expected
from
this
movement
the
lower
shenandoah
valley
was
occupied
by
the
enemy
under
general
milroy
who
with
his
headquarters
at
winchester
harassed
the
whole
region
which
he
ruled
with
a
rod
of
iron
with
the
withdrawal
of
the
federal
army
under
general
hooker
and
before
the
advance
of
the
confederates
general
milroy
would
also
disappear
and
the
fertile
fields
of
the
valley
be
relieved
the
whole
force
of
the
enemy
would
thus
says
lee
be
compelled
to
leave
virginia
and
possibly
to
draw
to
its
support
troops
designed
to
operate
against
other
parts
of
the
country
he
adds
in
this
way
it
was
supposed
that
the
enemy
plan
of
campaign
for
the
summer
would
be
broken
up
and
part
of
the
season
of
active
operations
be
consumed
in
the
formation
of
new
combinations
and
the
preparations
that
they
would
require
in
addition
to
these
advantages
it
was
hoped
that
other
valuable
results
might
be
attained
by
military
success
that
is
to
say
by
a
battle
which
lee
intended
to
fight
when
circumstances
were
favorable
that
he
expected
to
fight
not
merely
to
manoeuvre
the
enemy
from
virginia
is
apparent
from
another
sentence
of
the
report
it
was
thought
he
says
that
the
corresponding
movements
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
to
which
those
contemplated
by
us
would
probably
give
rise
might
a
fair
opportunity
to
strike
a
blow
at
the
army
therein
commanded
by
general
the
word
therein
referring
to
the
region
north
of
the
potomac
in
the
phrase
other
valuable
results
which
might
be
attained
by
military
success
the
reference
is
plainly
to
the
termination
of
the
contest
by
a
treaty
of
peace
based
upon
the
independence
of
the
south
these
sentences
taken
from
the
only
publication
ever
made
by
lee
on
the
subject
of
the
gettysburg
campaign
express
guardedly
but
distinctly
his
designs
he
aimed
to
draw
general
hooker
north
of
the
potomac
clear
the
valley
induce
the
enemy
to
send
troops
in
other
quarters
to
the
assistance
of
the
main
federal
army
and
when
the
moment
came
attack
general
hooker
defeat
him
if
possible
and
thus
end
the
war
that
a
decisive
defeat
of
the
federal
forces
at
that
time
in
maryland
or
pennsylvania
would
have
virtually
put
an
end
to
the
contest
there
seems
good
reason
to
believe
following
the
southern
victories
of
fredericksburg
and
chancellorsville
a
third
bloody
disaster
would
in
all
human
probability
have
broken
the
resolution
of
the
federal
authorities
with
lee
thundering
at
the
gates
of
washington
or
philadelphia
and
with
the
peace
party
encouraged
to
loud
and
importunate
protest
it
is
not
probable
that
the
war
would
have
continued
intelligent
persons
in
the
north
are
said
to
have
so
declared
since
the
war
and
the
declaration
seems
based
upon
good
sense
before
passing
from
this
necessary
preface
to
the
narrative
of
events
it
is
proper
to
add
that
in
the
contemplated
battle
with
general
hooker
when
he
had
drawn
him
north
of
the
potomac
lee
did
not
intend
to
assume
a
but
to
force
the
federal
commander
if
possible
to
make
the
attack
footnote
it
had
not
been
intended
to
fight
a
general
battle
at
such
a
distance
from
our
base
unless
attacked
by
the
enemy
from
this
resolution
he
was
afterward
induced
by
circumstances
to
depart
and
the
result
is
known
what
is
above
written
will
convey
to
the
reader
a
clear
conception
of
lee
views
and
intentions
in
undertaking
his
last
great
offensive
campaign
and
we
now
proceed
to
the
narrative
of
the
movements
of
the
two
armies
and
the
battle
of
gettysburg
xi
the
at
fleetwood
lee
began
his
movement
northward
on
the
day
of
june
just
one
month
after
the
battle
of
chancellorsville
from
this
moment
to
the
time
when
his
army
was
concentrated
in
the
vicinity
of
gettysburg
his
operations
were
rapid
and
energetic
but
with
a
cautious
regard
to
the
movements
of
the
enemy
pursuing
his
design
of
manoeuvring
the
federal
army
out
of
virginia
without
coming
to
action
lee
first
sent
forward
one
division
of
longstreet
corps
in
the
direction
of
culpepper
another
then
followed
and
on
the
and
of
june
ewell
entire
corps
was
sent
in
the
same
direction
hill
remaining
behind
on
the
south
bank
of
the
rappahannock
near
fredericksburg
to
watch
the
enemy
there
and
bar
the
road
to
richmond
these
movements
became
speedily
known
to
general
hooker
whose
army
lay
north
of
the
river
near
that
point
and
on
the
he
laid
a
pontoon
just
below
fredericksburg
and
crossed
about
a
corps
to
the
south
bank
opposite
hill
this
threatening
demonstration
however
was
not
suffered
by
lee
to
arrest
his
own
movements
seeing
that
the
presence
of
the
enemy
there
was
intended
for
the
purpose
of
observation
rather
than
attack
and
only
aimed
to
check
his
operations
he
continued
the
withdrawal
of
his
troops
by
way
of
culpepper
in
the
direction
of
the
shenandoah
valley
a
brilliant
pageant
succeeded
by
a
dramatic
and
stirring
incident
was
now
to
prelude
the
march
of
lee
into
the
enemy
territory
on
the
of
june
the
day
of
the
arrival
of
lee
head
of
column
in
culpepper
a
review
of
stuart
cavalry
took
place
in
a
field
east
of
the
the
review
was
a
picturesque
affair
general
lee
was
present
sitting
his
horse
motionless
on
a
little
knoll
the
erect
figure
half
concealed
by
the
short
falling
from
his
shoulders
and
the
grave
face
overshadowed
by
the
broad
gray
hat
while
above
him
from
a
lofty
pole
waved
the
folds
of
a
large
confederate
flag
the
long
column
of
about
eight
thousand
cavalry
was
first
drawn
up
in
line
and
afterward
passed
in
front
of
lee
at
a
gallop
stuart
and
his
leading
the
charge
with
sabres
at
tierce
point
a
species
of
military
display
highly
attractive
to
the
gallant
and
joyous
young
commander
the
men
then
charged
in
mimic
battle
the
guns
of
the
stuart
which
were
posted
upon
an
adjoining
hill
and
as
the
column
of
cavalry
approached
the
artillerists
received
them
with
a
thunderous
discharge
of
blank
ammunition
which
rolled
like
the
roar
of
actual
battle
among
the
surrounding
hills
this
was
kept
up
for
some
time
and
no
doubt
puzzled
the
enemy
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
rappahannock
on
the
next
morning
either
in
consequence
of
a
design
formed
before
the
review
or
to
ascertain
what
this
discharge
of
artillery
meant
two
divisions
of
federal
cavalry
supported
by
two
brigades
of
picked
infantry
were
sent
across
the
river
at
kelly
and
beverley
fords
east
of
the
to
beat
up
the
quarters
of
stuart
and
find
what
was
going
on
in
the
southern
camps
the
most
extensive
probably
of
the
whole
war
followed
one
of
stuart
brigades
near
beverley
ford
was
nearly
surprised
and
resolutely
attacked
at
daylight
by
buford
division
which
succeeded
in
forcing
back
the
brigade
a
short
distance
toward
the
high
range
called
fleetwood
hill
in
the
rear
from
this
eminence
where
his
headquarters
were
established
stuart
went
to
the
front
at
a
swift
gallop
opened
a
determined
fire
of
artillery
and
upon
the
advancing
enemy
and
sent
hampton
division
to
attack
them
on
their
left
meanwhile
however
the
enemy
were
executing
a
rapid
and
dangerous
movement
against
stuart
rear
general
gregg
commanding
the
second
federal
cavalry
division
crossed
at
ford
below
passed
the
force
left
in
that
quarter
and
came
in
directly
on
stuart
rear
behind
fleetwood
hill
in
the
midst
of
the
hard
fight
in
front
stuart
was
called
now
to
defend
his
rear
he
hastened
to
do
so
by
falling
back
and
meeting
the
enemy
now
charging
the
hill
the
attack
was
repulsed
and
the
enemy
artillery
charged
in
turn
by
the
southerners
this
was
captured
and
recaptured
two
or
three
times
but
at
last
remained
in
the
hands
of
stuart
general
gregg
now
swung
round
his
right
and
prepared
to
advance
along
the
eastern
slope
of
the
hill
stuart
had
however
posted
his
artillery
there
and
as
the
federal
line
began
to
move
arrested
it
with
a
sudden
and
destructive
fire
of
shell
at
the
same
time
a
portion
of
hampton
division
under
the
brave
georgian
general
young
was
ordered
to
charge
the
enemy
the
assault
was
promptly
made
with
the
sabre
unaided
by
carbine
or
pistol
fire
and
young
cut
down
or
routed
the
force
in
front
of
him
which
dispersed
in
disorder
toward
the
river
the
dangerous
assault
on
the
rear
of
fleetwood
hill
was
thus
repulsed
and
the
advance
of
the
enemy
on
the
left
near
the
river
met
with
the
same
ill
success
general
lee
son
of
the
commanding
general
gallantly
charged
them
in
that
quarter
and
drove
them
back
to
the
rappahannock
receiving
a
severe
wound
which
long
confined
him
to
his
bed
hampton
had
followed
the
retreating
enemy
on
the
right
under
the
fire
of
stuart
guns
from
fleetwood
hill
and
by
nightfall
the
whole
force
had
recrossed
the
rappahannock
leaving
several
hundred
dead
and
wounded
upon
the
field
footnote
the
southern
loss
was
also
considerable
colonel
williams
was
killed
generals
lee
and
butler
severely
wounded
the
latter
losing
his
foot
and
general
stuart
staff
had
been
peculiarly
unfortunate
of
the
small
group
of
officers
captain
farley
was
killed
captain
white
wounded
and
lieutenant
goldsborough
captured
the
federal
force
sustained
a
great
loss
in
the
death
of
the
gallant
colonel
davis
of
the
eighth
cavalry
and
other
officers
this
reconnoissance
in
force
the
federal
numbers
probably
amounting
to
fifteen
thousand
had
no
other
result
than
the
discovery
of
the
fact
that
lee
had
infantry
in
culpepper
finding
that
the
event
of
the
fight
was
critical
general
lee
had
moved
a
body
of
infantry
in
the
direction
of
the
field
of
action
and
the
gleam
of
the
bayonets
was
seen
by
the
enemy
the
infantry
was
not
however
engaged
on
either
side
unless
the
federal
infantry
participated
in
the
initial
skirmish
near
beverley
ford
and
general
lee
numbers
and
position
were
not
discovered
we
have
dwelt
with
some
detail
upon
this
cavalry
combat
which
was
an
animated
affair
the
encounter
of
nearly
twenty
thousand
horsemen
throughout
a
whole
day
general
stuart
was
censured
at
the
time
for
allowing
himself
to
be
surprised
and
a
ball
at
culpepper
at
which
some
of
his
officers
were
present
several
days
before
was
pointed
to
as
the
origin
of
this
surprise
the
charge
was
wholly
unjust
stuart
not
having
attended
the
ball
nor
was
there
any
truth
in
the
further
statement
that
his
headquarters
were
captured
in
consequence
of
his
negligence
his
tents
on
fleetwood
hill
were
all
sent
to
the
rear
soon
after
daylight
nothing
whatever
was
found
there
but
a
section
of
the
who
fought
the
charging
cavalry
with
sabres
and
over
the
guns
that
fleetwood
hill
was
at
one
time
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
was
due
not
to
negligence
but
to
the
numbers
and
excellent
soldiership
of
general
gregg
who
made
the
flank
and
rear
attack
while
stuart
was
breasting
that
in
front
these
detached
statements
which
may
seem
unduly
minute
are
made
in
justice
to
a
brave
soldier
who
can
no
longer
defend
himself
xii
the
march
to
gettysburg
this
attempt
of
the
enemy
to
penetrate
his
designs
had
not
induced
general
lee
to
interrupt
the
movement
of
his
infantry
toward
the
shenandoah
valley
the
federal
corps
sent
across
the
rappahannock
at
fredericksburg
still
remained
facing
general
hill
and
two
days
after
the
fleetwood
fight
general
hooker
moved
up
the
river
with
his
main
body
advancing
the
third
corps
to
a
point
near
beverley
ford
but
these
movements
were
disregarded
by
lee
on
the
same
day
corps
moved
rapidly
toward
chester
gap
passed
through
that
defile
in
the
mountain
pushed
on
by
way
of
front
royal
and
reached
winchester
on
the
evening
of
the
having
in
three
days
marched
seventy
miles
the
position
of
the
southern
army
now
exposed
it
to
very
serious
danger
and
at
first
sight
seemed
to
indicate
a
deficiency
of
soldiership
in
the
general
commanding
it
in
face
of
an
enemy
whose
force
was
at
least
equal
to
his
own
footnote
general
hooker
stated
his
effective
at
this
time
to
have
been
diminished
to
eighty
thousand
infantry
lee
had
extended
his
line
until
it
stretched
over
a
distance
of
about
one
hundred
miles
when
ewell
came
in
sight
of
winchester
hill
was
still
opposite
fredericksburg
and
longstreet
between
the
two
in
culpepper
between
the
middle
and
rear
corps
was
interposed
the
rapidan
river
and
between
the
middle
and
advanced
corps
the
blue
ridge
mountains
general
hooker
army
was
on
the
north
bank
of
the
rappahannock
well
in
hand
and
comparatively
massed
and
the
situation
of
lee
army
seemed
excellent
for
the
success
of
a
sudden
blow
at
it
it
seems
that
the
propriety
of
attacking
the
southern
army
while
thus
suggested
itself
both
to
general
hooker
and
to
president
lincoln
but
they
differed
as
to
the
point
and
object
of
the
attack
in
anticipation
of
lee
movement
general
hooker
had
written
to
the
president
probably
suggesting
a
across
the
rappahannock
somewhere
near
fredericksburg
to
threaten
richmond
and
thus
check
lee
advance
this
however
president
lincoln
refused
to
sanction
in
case
you
find
lee
coming
to
the
north
of
the
rappahannock
president
lincoln
wrote
to
general
hooker
i
would
by
no
means
cross
to
the
south
of
it
i
would
not
take
any
risk
of
being
entangled
upon
the
river
an
ox
jumped
half
over
a
fence
and
liable
to
be
torn
by
dogs
front
and
rear
without
a
fair
chance
to
gore
one
way
or
kick
the
five
days
afterward
the
president
wrote
i
think
lee
army
and
not
richmond
is
your
true
objective
point
if
he
comes
toward
the
upper
potomac
fight
him
when
opportunity
offers
if
he
stays
where
he
is
him
and
fret
when
intelligence
now
reached
washington
that
the
head
of
lee
column
was
approaching
the
upper
potomac
while
the
rear
was
south
of
the
rappahannock
the
president
wrote
to
general
hooker
the
head
of
lee
army
is
at
martinsburg
and
the
tail
of
it
on
the
plank
between
fredericksburg
and
chancellorsville
the
must
be
very
slim
somewhere
could
you
not
break
him
general
hooker
did
not
seem
to
be
able
to
determine
upon
a
decisive
course
of
action
in
spite
of
the
tempting
opening
presented
to
him
by
lee
it
would
seem
that
nothing
could
have
been
plainer
than
the
good
policy
of
an
attack
upon
hill
at
fredericksburg
which
would
certainly
have
checked
lee
movement
by
recalling
longstreet
from
culpepper
and
ewell
from
the
valley
but
this
bold
operation
did
not
appear
to
commend
itself
to
the
federal
authorities
instead
of
reënforcing
the
corps
sent
across
at
fredericksburg
and
attacking
hill
general
hooker
withdrew
the
corps
on
the
to
the
north
bank
of
the
river
got
his
forces
together
and
began
to
fall
back
toward
manassas
and
even
remained
in
ignorance
it
seems
of
all
connected
with
his
movements
even
as
late
as
the
of
june
his
general
butterfield
wrote
to
one
of
his
officers
try
and
hunt
up
somebody
from
pennsylvania
who
knows
something
and
has
a
cool
enough
head
to
judge
what
is
the
actual
state
of
affairs
there
with
regard
to
the
enemy
impression
is
that
lee
movement
on
the
upper
potomac
is
a
cover
for
a
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
we
can
not
go
boggling
around
until
we
know
what
we
are
going
such
was
the
first
result
of
lee
daring
movement
to
transfer
military
operations
to
the
region
north
of
the
potomac
a
northern
historian
has
discerned
in
his
plan
of
campaign
an
amount
of
boldness
which
seemed
to
imply
a
great
contempt
for
his
opponent
this
is
perhaps
a
somewhat
exaggerated
statement
of
the
case
without
boldness
a
commander
is
but
half
a
soldier
and
it
may
be
declared
that
a
certain
amount
of
that
quality
is
absolutely
essential
to
successful
military
operations
but
the
question
is
did
lee
expose
himself
by
these
movements
of
his
army
to
probable
disaster
if
his
adversary
equal
to
the
occasion
struck
at
his
flank
a
failure
of
the
campaign
of
invasion
would
probably
have
resulted
from
such
an
attack
either
upon
hill
at
fredericksburg
or
upon
longstreet
in
culpepper
inasmuch
as
ewell
column
in
that
event
must
have
fallen
back
but
a
of
the
combined
forces
of
hill
and
longstreet
who
were
within
supporting
distance
of
each
other
was
not
an
event
which
general
hooker
could
count
upon
with
any
degree
of
certainty
the
two
corps
numbered
nearly
fifty
thousand
men
that
is
to
say
of
the
southern
army
general
hooker
whole
force
was
but
about
eighty
thousand
and
it
was
not
probable
that
the
eighty
thousand
would
be
able
to
rout
the
fifty
thousand
when
at
chancellorsville
less
than
this
last
number
of
southerners
had
defeated
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
there
seems
little
reason
to
doubt
that
general
lee
took
this
view
of
the
subject
and
relied
on
hill
and
longstreet
to
unite
and
repulse
any
attack
upon
them
while
ewell
great
raiding
column
drove
forward
into
the
heart
of
the
enemy
territory
that
the
movement
was
bold
there
can
certainly
be
no
question
that
it
was
a
reckless
and
hazardous
operation
depending
for
its
success
in
lee
eyes
solely
on
the
supposed
inefficiency
of
general
hooker
does
not
appear
these
comments
delay
the
narrative
but
the
subject
is
fruitful
in
suggestion
it
may
be
pardoned
a
southern
writer
if
he
lingers
over
this
last
great
offensive
movement
of
the
southern
army
the
last
it
was
also
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
brilliant
the
war
therefore
was
to
enter
upon
its
second
stage
in
which
the
south
was
to
simply
maintain
the
defensive
but
lee
was
terminating
the
first
stage
of
the
contest
by
one
of
those
great
campaigns
which
project
events
and
personages
in
bold
relief
from
the
broad
canvas
and
illumine
the
pages
of
history
events
were
now
in
rapid
progress
ewell
column
the
sharp
head
of
the
southern
spear
reached
winchester
on
the
of
june
and
rodes
who
had
been
detached
at
front
royal
to
drive
the
enemy
from
berryville
reached
the
village
on
the
same
day
when
the
force
there
retreated
to
winchester
on
the
next
morning
division
attacked
the
forces
of
milroy
at
winchester
stormed
and
captured
their
star
fort
on
a
hill
near
the
place
and
so
complete
was
the
rout
of
the
enemy
that
their
commander
general
milroy
had
scarcely
time
to
escape
with
a
handful
of
his
men
in
the
direction
of
the
potomac
for
this
disaster
the
unfortunate
officer
was
harshly
criticised
by
general
hooker
who
wrote
to
his
government
in
my
opinion
men
will
fight
better
a
after
thus
clearing
the
country
around
winchester
ewell
advanced
rapidly
on
martinsburg
where
he
took
a
number
of
prisoners
and
some
artillery
the
captures
in
two
days
had
been
more
than
four
thousand
prisoners
and
cannon
with
four
hundred
horses
and
a
large
amount
of
stores
ewell
continued
then
to
advance
and
entering
maryland
sent
a
portion
of
his
cavalry
under
general
imboden
westward
to
destroy
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
and
another
body
under
general
jenkins
in
advance
toward
chambersburg
meanwhile
the
rest
of
the
army
was
moving
to
join
him
hill
finding
that
the
enemy
had
disappeared
from
his
front
near
fredericksburg
hastened
to
march
from
that
vicinity
and
was
sent
forward
by
lee
on
the
track
of
ewell
passing
in
rear
of
longstreet
who
had
remained
in
culpepper
the
latter
was
now
directed
by
lee
to
move
along
the
eastern
side
of
the
blue
ridge
and
by
occupying
ashby
and
snicker
gaps
protect
the
flank
of
the
column
in
the
valley
from
attack
a
work
in
which
stuart
cavalry
thrown
out
toward
the
enemy
assisted
such
was
the
posture
of
affairs
when
general
hooker
became
so
much
puzzled
and
described
the
federal
army
as
boggling
around
and
not
knowing
what
they
were
going
after
lee
whole
movement
it
appears
was
regarded
as
a
feint
to
cover
a
on
the
south
side
of
the
river
a
strange
conclusion
it
would
seem
in
reference
to
a
movement
of
such
magnitude
it
now
became
absolutely
necessary
that
lee
designs
should
be
unmasked
if
possible
and
to
effect
this
object
stuart
cavalry
force
covering
the
southern
flank
east
of
the
blue
ridge
must
be
driven
back
this
was
undertaken
in
a
deliberate
manner
three
corps
of
cavalry
with
a
division
of
infantry
and
a
full
supply
of
artillery
were
sent
forward
from
the
vicinity
of
manassas
to
drive
stuart
in
on
all
the
roads
leading
to
the
mountain
a
fierce
struggle
followed
in
which
stuart
who
knew
the
importance
of
his
position
fought
the
great
force
opposed
to
him
from
every
hill
and
knoll
but
he
was
forced
back
steadily
in
spite
of
a
determined
resistance
and
at
upperville
a
wound
up
the
movement
in
which
the
federal
cavalry
was
checked
when
stuart
fell
back
toward
paris
crowned
the
with
his
cannon
and
awaited
a
final
attack
this
was
not
however
made
night
approaching
the
federal
force
fell
back
toward
manassas
and
on
the
next
morning
stuart
followed
them
on
the
same
road
over
which
he
had
so
rapidly
retreated
beyond
middleburg
lee
paid
little
attention
to
these
operations
on

east
of

of

footnote
this
statement
of

orders
is
derived
by
the
writer
from
ewell
general
hooker
had
followed
crossing
the
potomac
opposite
leesburg
at
about
the
moment
when
lee
rear
was
passing
from
maryland
into
pennsylvania
the
direction
of
the
federal
march
was
toward
frederick
from
which
point
general
hooker
could
move
in
either
one
of
two
directions
either
across
the
mountain
toward
boonsboro
which
would
throw
him
upon
lee
communications
or
northward
to
westminster
or
gettysburg
which
would
lead
to
an
open
collision
with
the
invading
army
in
a
pitched
battle
at
this
juncture
of
affairs
just
as
the
federal
army
was
concentrating
near
frederick
general
hooker
at
his
own
request
was
relieved
from
command
the
occasion
of
this
unexpected
event
seems
to
have
been
a
difference
of
opinion
between
himself
and
general
halleck
the
federal
on
the
question
whether
the
fortifications
at
harper
ferry
should
or
should
not
be
abandoned
the
point
at
issue
would
appear
to
have
been
unimportant
but
ill
feeling
seems
to
have
arisen
general
hooker
resented
the
action
of
the
authorities
and
requested
to
be
relieved
his
request
was
complied
with
and
his
place
was
filled
by

general
meade
an

the
repute

and
dignity
assumed

of

of

design
of
moving
directly
across
the

from

drew
him
perforce

with
one
division

penetrated
to
carlisle
and
early
with
another
division
was
at
york
everywhere
the
horses
cattle
and
supplies
of
the
country
had
been
seized
upon
for
the
use
of
the
troops
and
general
meade
was
loudly
called
upon
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
the
people
thus
exposed
to
the
terrible
rebels
his
movements
were
rapid
assuming
command
on
june
he
began
to
move
on
the
and
on
the
was
approaching
the
town
of
gettysburg
footnote
the
movements
of
the
federal
commander
were
probably
hastened
by
the
capture
about
this
time
at
hagerstown
of
a
dispatch
from
president
davis
to
general
lee
lee
it
seems
had
suggested
that
general
beauregard
should
be
sent
to
make
a
demonstration
in
the
direction
of
culpepper
and
by
thus
appearing
to
threaten
washington
embarrass
the
movements
of
the
northern
army
to
this
suggestion
the
president
is
said
to
have
replied
that
he
had
no
troops
to
make
such
a
movement
and
general
meade
had
thus
the
proof
before
him
that
washington
was
in
no
danger
the
confederacy
was
thus
truly
unfortunate
again
as
in
september
when
a
similar
incident
came
to
the
relief
of
general
mcclellan
xiii
lee
in
pennsylvania
lee
in
personal
command
of
the
corps

meanwhile
moved
on
steadily
in
the
direction
of
the
susquehanna
and
reaching
chambersburg
on
the
of
june
made
preparations
to
advance
upon
harrisburg
at
chambersburg
he
issued
an
order
to
the
troops
which
should
find
a
place
in
every
biography
of
this
great
soldier
the
course
pursued
by
many
of
the
federal
commanders
in
virginia
had
been
merciless
and
atrocious
beyond
words
general
pope
had
ravaged
the
counties
north
of
the
rappahannock
especially
the
county
of
culpepper
in
a
manner
which
reduced
that
smiling
region
wellnigh
to
a
waste
general
milroy
with
his
headquarters
at
winchester
had
so
cruelly
oppressed
the
people
of
the
surrounding
country
as
to
make
them
execrate
the
very
mention
of
his
name
and
the
excesses
committed
by
the
troops
of
these
officers
with
the
knowledge
and
permission
of
their
commanders
had
been
such
said
a
foreign
writer
as
to
cast
mankind
two
centuries
back
toward
barbarism
now
the
tables
were
turned
and
the
world
looked
for
a
sudden
and
merciless
retaliation
on
the
part
of
the
southerners
lee
was
in
pennsylvania
at
the
head
of
an
army
thirsting
to
revenge
the
accumulated
wrongs
against
their
helpless
families
at
a
word
from
him
the
fertile
territory
of
the
north
would
be
made
to
feel
the
iron
pressure
of
military
rule
proceeding
on
the
theory
that
retaliation
is
a
just
principle
to
adopt
toward
an
enemy
fire
slaughter
and
outrage
would
have
burst
upon
pennsylvania
and
the
black
flag
which
had
been
virtually
raised
by
generals
pope
and
milroy
would
have
flaunted
now
in
the
air
at
the
head
of
the
southern
army
instead
of
permitting
this
disgraceful
oppression
of
lee
issued
at
chambersburg
the
following
general
order
to
his
troops
headquarters
army
of
northern
virginia
chambersburg
the
commanding
general
has
observed
with
much
satisfaction
the
conduct
of
the
troops
on
the
march
and
confidently
anticipates
results
commensurate
with
the
high
spirit
they
have
manifested
no
troops
could
have
displayed
greater
fortitude
or
better
performed
the
arduous
marches
of
the
past
ten
days
their
conduct
in
other
respects
has
with
few
exceptions
been
in
keeping
with
their
character
as
soldiers
and
entitles
them
to
approbation
and
praise
there
have
however
been
instances
of
forgetfulness
on
the
part
of
some
that
they
have
in
keeping
the
yet
unsullied
reputation
of
the
army
and
that
the
duties
exacted
of
us
by
civilization
and
christianity
are
not
less
obligatory
in
the
country
of
the
enemy
than
in
our
own
the
commanding
general
considers
that
no
greater
disgrace
could
befall
the
army
and
through
it
our
whole
people
than
the
perpetration
of
the
barbarous
outrages
on
the
innocent
and
defenceless
and
the
wanton
destruction
of
private
property
that
have
marked
the
course
of
the
enemy
in
our
own
country
such
proceedings
not
only
disgrace
the
perpetrators
and
all
connected
with
them
but
are
subversive
of
the
discipline
and
efficiency
of
the
army
and
destructive
of
the
ends
of
our
present
movements
it
must
be
remembered
that
we
make
war
only
upon
armed
men
and
that
we
can
not
take
vengeance
for
the
wrongs
our
people
have
suffered
without
lowering
ourselves
in
the
eyes
of
all
whose
abhorrence
has
been
excited
by
the
atrocities
of
our
enemy
without
offending
against
him
to
whom
vengeance
belongeth
without
whose
favor
and
support
our
efforts
must
all
prove
in
vain
the
commanding
general
therefore
earnestly
exhorts
the
troops
to
abstain
with
most
scrupulous
care
from
unnecessary
or
wanton
injury
to
private
property
and
he
enjoins
upon
all
officers
to
arrest
and
bring
to
summary
punishment
all
who
shall
in
any
way
offend
against
the
orders
on
this
subject
lee
the
noble
maxims
and
truly
christian
spirit
of
this
paper
will
remain
the
undying
glory
of
lee
under
what
had
been
surely
a
bitter
provocation
he
retained
the
calmness
and
forbearance
of
a
great
soul
saying
to
his
army
the
duties
exacted
of
us
by
civilization
and
christianity
are
not
less
obligatory
in
the
country
of
the
enemy
than
in
our
own
no
greater
disgrace
could
befall
the
army
and
through
it
our
whole
people
than
the
perpetration
of
outrage
upon
the
innocent

defenceless
we
make

can
not
take

the
wrongs
our

have
suffered
without
offending
against
him
to
whom
vengeance
belongeth
without
whose
favor
and
support
our
efforts
must
all
prove
in
vain
such
were
the
utterances
of
lee
resembling
those
we
might
attribute
to
the
ideal
christian
warrior
and
indeed
it
was
such
a
spirit
that
lay
under
the
plain
uniform
of
the
great
virginian
what
he
ordered
was
enforced
and
no
one
was
disturbed
in
his
person
or
property
of
this
statement
many
proofs
could
be
given
a
pennsylvania
farmer
said
to
a
northern
correspondent
in
reference
to
the
southern
troops
i
must
say
they
acted
like
gentlemen
and
their
cause
aside
i
would
rather
have
forty
thousand
rebels
quartered
on
my
premises
than
one
thousand
union
troops
from
the
journal
of
colonel
freemantle
an
english
officer
accompanying
the
southern
army
we
take
these
sentences
in
passing
through
greencastle
we
found
all
the
houses
and
windows
shut
up
the
natives
in
their
sunday
clothes
standing
at
their
doors
regarding
the
troops
in
a
very
unfriendly
manner
i
saw
no
straggling
into
the
houses
nor
were
any
of
the
inhabitants
disturbed
or
annoyed
by
the
soldiers
sentries
were
placed
at
the
doors
of
many
of
the
best
houses
to
prevent
any
officer
or
soldier
from
getting
in
on
any
pretence
i
entered
chambersburg
at
sentries
were
placed
at
the
doors
of
all
the
principal
houses
and
the
town
was
cleared
of
all
but
the
military
passing
through
or
on
duty
no
officer
or
soldier
under
the
rank
of
a
general
is
allowed
in
chambersburg
without
a
special
order
from
general
lee
which
he
is
very
chary
of
giving
and
i
hear
of
officers
of
rank
being
refused
this
pass
i
went
into
chambersburg
again
and
witnessed
the
singularly
good
behavior
of
the
troops
toward
the
citizens
i
heard
soldiers
saying
to
one
another
that
they
did
not
like
being
in
a
town
in
which
they
were
very
naturally
detested
to
any
one
who
has
seen
as
i
have
the
ravages
of
the
northern
troops
in
southern
towns
this
forbearance
seems
most
commendable
and
surprising
a
northern
correspondent
said
of
the
course
pursued
by
general
jenkins
in
command
of
ewell
cavalry
by
way
of
giving
the
devil
his
due
it
must
be
said
that
although
there
were
over
sixty
acres
of
wheat
and
eighty
acres
of
corn
and
oats
in
the
same
field
he
protected
it
most
carefully
and
picketed
his
horses
so
that
it
could
not
be
injured
no
fences
were
wantonly
destroyed
poultry
was
not
disturbed
nor
did
he
compliment
our
blooded
cattle
so
much
as
to
test
the
quality
of
their
steak
and
roast
of
the
feeling
of
the
troops
these
few
words
from
the
letter
of
an
officer
written
to
one
of
his
family
will
convey
an
idea
i
felt
when
i
first
came
here
that
i
would
like
to
revenge
myself
upon
these
people
for
the
devastation
they
have
brought
upon
our
own
beautiful
home
that
home
where
we
could
have
lived
so
happily
and
that
we
loved
so
much
from
which
their
vandalism
has
driven
you
and
my
helpless
little
ones
but
though
i
had
such
severe
wrongs
and
grievances
to
redress
and
such
great
cause
for
revenge
yet
when
i
got
among
these
people
i
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
molest
them
such
was
the
treatment
of
the
people
of
pennsylvania
by
the
southern
troops
in
obedience
to
the
order
of
the
lee
in
person
set
the
example
a
southern
journal
made
the
sarcastic
statement
that
he
became
irate
at
the
robbing
of
and
if
he
saw
the
of
a
fence
lying
upon
the
ground
as
he
rode
by
would
dismount
and
replace
it
with
his
own
hands
xiv
concentration
at
gettysburg
this
was
the
position
of
the
great
adversaries
in
the
last
days
of
june
lee
was
at
chambersburg
in
the
cumberland
valley
about
to
follow
ewell
who
was
approaching
harrisburg
early
had
captured
york
and
the
federal
army
was
concentrating
rapidly
on
the
flank
of
the
southern
army
toward
gettysburg
lee
had
ordered
the
movement
of
early
upon
york
with
the
object
of
diverting
the
attention
of
the
federal
commander
from
his
own
rear
in
the
cumberland
valley
the
exact
movements
and
position
of
general
meade
were
unknown
to
him
and
this
arose
in
large
measure
from
the
absence
of
stuart
cavalry
this
unfortunate
incident
has
given
rise
to
much
comment
and
stuart
has
been
harshly
criticised
for
an
alleged
disobedience
of
lee
plain
orders
the
question
is
an
embarrassing
one
lee
statement
is
as
follows
general
stuart
was
left
to
guard
the
passes
of
the
mountains
ashby
and
other
gaps
in
the
blue
ridge
in
virginia
and
observe
the
movements
of
the
enemy
whom
he
was
instructed
to
harass
and
impede
as
much
as
possible
should
he
attempt
to
cross
the
potomac
that
event
general
stuart
was
directed
to
move
into
maryland
crossing
the
potomac
east
or
west
of
the
blue
ridge
as
in
his
judgment
should
be
best
and
take
position
on
the
right
of
our
column
as
it
this
order
was
certainly
plain
up
to
a
certain
point
stuart
was
to
harass
and
embarrass
the
movements
of
the
enemy
in
case
they
attempted
to
cross
to
the
north
bank
of
the
potomac
when
they
did
cross
he
also
was
to
pass
the
river
either
east
or
west
of
the
blue
ridge
as
in
his
judgment
should
seem
best
so
far
the
order
was
unmistakable
the
river
was
to
be
crossed
at
such
point
as
stuart
should
select
either
on
the
lower
waters
or
in
the
valley
lee
added
however
that
this
movement
should
be
made
in
such
a
manner
as
to
enable
stuart
to
take
position
on
the
right
of
our
column
as
it
advanced
the
meaning
appearing
to
be
that
the
cavalry
should
move
the
two
armies
in
order
to
guard
the
southern
flank
as
it
advanced
into
the
cumberland
valley
circumstances
arose
however
which
rendered
it
difficult
for
stuart
to
move
on
the
line
thus
indicated
with
sufficient
promptness
to
render
his
services
valuable
the
enemy
crossed
at
leesburg
while
the
southern
cavalry
was
near
middleburg
and
from
the
jaded
condition
of
his
horses
stuart
feared
that
he
would
be
unable
in
case
he
crossed
above
to
place
his
column
between
the
two
armies
then
rapidly
advancing
he
accordingly
took
the
bold
resolution
of
passing
the
potomac
leesburg
designing
to
shape
his
course
due
northward
toward
harrisburg
the
objective
point
of
the
southern
army
this
he
did
crossing
at
seneca
falls
but
on
the
march
he
was
delayed
by
many
incidents
near
rockville
he
stopped
to
capture
a
large
train
of
federal
wagons
at
westminster
and
hanovertown
he
was
temporarily
arrested
by
combats
with
the
federal
cavalry
and
ignorant
as
he
was
of
the
concentration
of
lee
troops
upon
gettysburg
he
advanced
rapidly
toward
carlisle
where
in
the
midst
of
an
attack
on
that
place
he
was
recalled
by
lee
such
were
the
circumstances
leading
to
and
the
incidents
attending
this
movement
the
reader
must
form
his
own
opinion
of
the
amount
of
blame
to
be
justly
attached
to
stuart
he
always
declared
and
asserted
in
his
report
of
these
occurrences
that
he
had
acted
in
exact
obedience
to
his
orders
but
on
the
contrary
as
appears
from
general
lee
report
those
orders
were
meant
to
prescribe
a
different
movement
he
had
marched
in
one
sense
on
the
right
of
the
southern
column
as
it
advanced
but
in
another
sense
he
had
not
done
so
victory
at
gettysburg
would
have
silenced
all
criticism
of
this
difference
of
construction
but
unfortunately
the
event
was
different
and
the
strictures
directed
at
stuart
were
natural
the
absence
of
the
cavalry
unquestionably
embarrassed
lee
greatly
but
in
his
report
he
is
moderate
and
guarded
as
usual
in
his

to
return
now
to
the
movements
of

infantry
after
the
arrival
of
the
main
body
at
chambersburg
lee
was
about
to
continue
his
advance
in
the
direction
of
harrisburg
when
on
the
night
of
the
his
scouts
brought
him
intelligence
that
the
federal
army
was
rapidly
advancing
and
the
head
of
the
column
was
near
the
south
mountain
a
glance
at
the
map
will
indicate
the
importance
of
this
intelligence
general
meade
would
be
able
without
difficulty
in
case
the
southern
army
continued
its
march
northward
to
cross
the
range
and
place
himself
directly
in
lee
rear
in
the
cumberland
valley
then
the
southern
forces
would
be
completely
intercepted
general
meade
would
be
master
of
the
situation
and
lee
must
retreat
east
of
the
mountain
or
cut
his
way
through
the
federal
army
a
battle
was
thus
clearly
about
to
be
forced
upon
the
southern
commander
and
it
only
remained
for
him
to
so
manoeuvre
his
army
as
to
secure
a
position
in
which
he
could
receive
the
enemy
attack
with
advantage
lee
accordingly
put
his
column
in
motion
across
the
mountain
toward
gettysburg
and
sending
couriers
to
ewell
and
early
to
return
from
harrisburg
and
york
toward
the
same
point
made
his
preparations
to
take
position
and
fight
on
the
morning
of
the
day
of
july
this
was
then
the
condition
of
affairs
general
meade
was
advancing
with
rapidity
upon
the
town
of
gettysburg
and
lee
was
crossing
the
south
mountain
opposite
chambersburg
to
meet
him
when
the
heads
of
the
two
columns
came
together
in
the
vicinity
of
gettysburg
the
thunders
of
battle
began
xv
the
first
day
fight
at
gettysburg
the
sanguinary
struggle
which
now
ensued
between
the
army
of
northern
virginia
and
the
army
of
the
potomac
continued
for
three
days
and
the
character
of
these
battles
together
with
their
decisive
results
have
communicated
to
the
events
an
extraordinary
interest
every
fact
has
thus
been
preserved
and
the
incidents
of
the
great
combat
down
to
the
most
minute
details
have
been
placed
upon
record
the
subject
is
indeed
almost
embarrassed
by
the
amount
of
information
collected
and
published
and
the
chief
difficulty
for
a
writer
at
this
late
day
is
to
select
from
the
mass
such
salient
events
as
indicate
clearly
the
character
of
the
conflict
this
difficulty
the
present
writer
has
it
in
his
power
to
evade
in
great
measure
by
confining
himself
mainly
to
the
designs
and
operations
of
general
lee
these
were
plain
and
simple
he
had
been
forced
to
relinquish
his
march
toward
the
susquehanna
by
the
dangerous
position
of
general
meade
so
near
his
line
of
retreat
this
rendered
a
battle
unavoidable
and
lee
was
now
moving
to
accept
battle
designing
if
possible
to
secure
such
a
position
as
would
give
him
the
advantage
in
the
contest
before
he
succeeded
in
effecting
this
object
battle
was
forced
upon
him
not
by
general
meade
but
by
simple
stress
of
circumstances
the
federal
commander
had
formed
the
same
intention
as
that
of
his
adversary
to
accept
and
not
deliver
battle
and
did
not
propose
to
fight
near
gettysburg
he
was
rather
looking
backward
to
a
strong
position
in
the
direction
of
westminster
when
suddenly
the
head
of
his
column
became
engaged
near
gettysburg
and
this
determined
every
thing
a
few
words
are
necessary
to
convey
to
the
reader
some
idea
of
the
character
of
the
ground
gettysburg
is
a
town
nestling
down
in
a
valley
with
so
many
roads
centring
in
the
place
that
if
a
circle
were
drawn
around
it
to
represent
the
circumference
of
a
wheel
the
roads
would
resemble
the
spokes
a
short
distance
south
of
the
town
is
a
ridge
of
considerable
height
which
runs
north
and
south
bending
eastward
in
the
vicinity
of
gettysburg
and
describing
a
curve
resembling
a
hook
from
a
graveyard
on
this
high
ground
it
is
called
cemetery
hill
or
ridge
opposite
this
ridge
looking
westward
is
a
second
and
lower
range
called
seminary
ridge
this
extends
also
north
and
south
passing
west
of
gettysburg
still
west
of
seminary
ridge
are
other
still
lower
ranges
between
which
flows
a
small
stream
called
willoughby
run
and
beyond
these
distant
about
ten
miles
rise
the
blue
heights
of
the
south
mountain
across
the
south
mountain
by
way
of
the
village
of
cashtown
lee
on
the
morning
of
the
of
july
was
moving
steadily
toward
gettysburg
when
hill
holding
the
front
suddenly
encountered
the
head
of
the
enemy
column
in
the
vicinity
of
willoughby
run
this
consisted
of
general
buford
cavalry
division
which
had
pushed
on
in
advance
of
general
reynolds
infantry
corps
the
foremost
infantry
of
the
federal
army
and
now
almost
before
it
was
aware
of
hill
presence
became
engaged
with
him
general
buford
posted
his
to
meet
hill
attack
but
it
soon
became
obvious
that
the
federal
cavalry
could
not
stand
before
the
southern
infantry
fire
and
general
reynolds
at
about
ten
in
the
morning
hastening
forward
reached
the
field
an
engagement
immediately
took
place
between
the
foremost
infantry
divisions
of
hill
and
reynolds
a
brigade
of
hill
from
mississippi
drove
back
a
federal
brigade
seizing
upon
its
artillery
but
in
return
archer
brigade
was
nearly
surrounded
and
several
hundred
of
the
men
captured
almost
immediately
after
this
incident
the
federal
forces
sustained
a
serious
loss
general
reynolds
one
of
the
most
trusted
and
energetic
lieutenants
of
general
meade
was
mortally
wounded
while
disposing
his
men
for
action
and
borne
from
the
field
the
federal
troops
continued
however
to
fight
with
gallantry
some
of
the
men
were
heard
exclaiming
we
have
come
to
stay
in
reference
to
which
one
of
their
officers
afterward
said
and
a
very
large
portion
of
them
never
left
that
ground
footnote
general

on
the

part
p
battle
was
now
joined
in
earnest
between
the
two
heads
of
column
and
on
each
side
reënforcements
were
sent
forward
to
take
part
in
this
unexpected
encounter
neither
general
lee
nor
general
meade
had
expected
or
desired
it
both
had
aimed
in
manoeuvring
their
forces
to
select
ground
suitable
for
receiving
instead
of
making
an
attack
and
now
a
blind
chance
seemed
about
to
bring
on
a
battle
upon
ground
unknown
to
both
commanders
when
the
sound
of
the
engagement
was
first
heard
by
lee
he
was
in
the
rear
of
his
troops
at
the
headquarters
which
hill
had
just
vacated
near
cashtown
under
the
south
mountain
the
firing
was
naturally
supposed
by
him
to
indicate
an
accidental
collision
with
some
body
of
the
enemy
cavalry
and
when
intelligence
reached
him
that
hill
was
engaged
with
the
federal
infantry
the
announcement
occasioned
him
the
greatest
astonishment
general
meade
presence
so
near
him
was
a
circumstance
completely
unknown
to
lee
and
certainly
was
not
desired
by
him
but
a
small
portion
of
his
forces
were
up
longstreet
had
not
yet
passed
the
mountain
and
the
forces
of
general
ewell
although
that
officer
had
promptly
fallen
back
in
obedience
to
his
orders
from
the
susquehanna
were
not
yet
in
a
position
to
take
part
in
the
engagement
under
these
circumstances
if
the
whole
of
general
army
had
reached
gettysburg
directly
in
lee
front
the
advantage
in
the
approaching
action
must
be
largely
in
favor
of
the
federal
army
and
a
battle
might
result
in
a
decisive
confederate
defeat
no
choice
however
was
now
left
general
lee
the
head
of
his
advancing
column
had
come
into
collision
with
the
enemy
and
it
was
impossible
to
retire
without
a
battle
lee
accordingly
ordered
corps
to
be
closed
up
and
reënforcements
to
be
sent
forward
rapidly
to
the
point
of
action
he
then
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
in
the
direction
of
the
firing
guided
by
the
sound
and
the
smoke
which
rose
above
the
tranquil
landscape
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
a
beautiful
season
of
the
year
the
fields
were
green
with
grass
or
golden
with
ripening
grain
over
which
passed
a
gentle
breeze
raising
waves
upon
the
brilliant
surface
the
landscape
was
broken
here
and
there
by
woods
in
the
west
rose
the
blue
range
of
the
south
mountain
the
sun
was
shining
through
showery
clouds
and
in
the
east
the
sky
was
spanned
by
a
rainbow
this
peaceful
scene
was
now
disturbed
by
the
thundering
of
artillery
and
the
rattle
of
musketry
the
sky
was
darkened
here
and
there
by
clouds
of
smoke
rising
from
barns
or
set
on
fire
by
shell
and
beneath
rose
red
tongues
of
flame
roaring
in
response
to
the
guns
each
side
had
now
sent
forward
reinforcements
to
support
the
vanguards
and
an
obstinate
struggle
ensued
the
proportions
of
the
fight
gradually
increasing
until
the
action
became
a
regular
battle
hill
although
suffering
from
indisposition
which
the
pallor
of
his
face
indicated
met
the
federal
attack
with
his
habitual
resolution
he
was
hard
pressed
however
when
fortunately
one
of
general
divisions
under
rodes
débouched
from
the
carlisle
road
running
northward
from
gettysburg
and
came
to
his
assistance
ewell
had
just
begun
to
move
from
carlisle
toward
harrisburg
his
second
division
under
early
being
at
york
when
a
dispatch
from
lee
reached
him
directing
him
to
return
and
proceed
to
gettysburg
or
cashtown
as
his
circumstances
might
direct
he
promptly
obeyed
encamped
within
about
eight
miles
of
gettysburg
on
the
evening
of
the
and
was
now
moving
toward
cashtown
where
johnson
division
of
his
corps
then
was
when
hill
sent
him
word
that
he
needed
his
assistance
rodes
was
promptly
sent
forward
to
the
field
of
action
early
was
ordered
to
hurry
back
and
rodes
soon
reached
the
where
he
formed
his
line
on
high
ground
opposite
the
federal
right
the
appearance
of
this
important
reënforcement
relieved
hill
and
caused
the
enemy
to
extend
his
right
to
face
rodes
the
federal
line
thus
resembled
a
crescent
the
left
half
fronting
hill
toward
the
northwest
and
the
right
rodes
toward
the
north
the
town
of
gettysburg
being
in
rear
of
the
curve
an
obstinate
attack
was
made
by
the
enemy
and
by
rodes
at
nearly
the
same
moment
the
loss
on
both
sides
was
heavy
but
rodes
succeeded
in
shaking
the
federal
right
when
early
made
his
appearance
from
the
direction
of
york
this
compelled
the
federal
force
to
still
farther
extend
its
right
to
meet
the
new
attack
the
movement
greatly
weakened
them
rodes
charged
their
centre
with
impetuosity
early
came
in
on
their
right
with
gordon
brigade
in
front
and
under
this
combined
attack
the
federal
troops
gave
way
and
retreated
in
great
disorder
to
and
through
gettysburg
leaving
the
ground
covered
with
their
dead
and
wounded
to
the
number
of
about
five
thousand
and
the
same
number
of
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
the
confederates
the
first
collision
of
the
two
armies
had
thus
resulted
in
a
clear
southern
victory
and
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
this
important
success
was
not
followed
up
by
the
seizure
of
the
cemetery
range
south
of
the
town
which
it
was
in
the
power
of
the
southern
forces
at
that
time
to
do
to
whom
the
blame
if
blame
there
be
of
this
failure
is
justly
chargeable
the
writer
of
these
pages
is
unable
to
state
all
that
he
has
been
able
to
ascertain
with
certainty
is
the
following
as
soon
as
the
federal
forces
gave
way
general
lee
rode
forward
and
at
about
four
in
the
afternoon
was
posted
on
an
elevated
point
of
seminary
ridge
from
which
he
could
see
the
broken
lines
of
the
enemy
rapidly
retreating
up
the
slope
of
cemetery
range
in
his
front
the
propriety
of
pursuit
with
a
view
to
seizing
this
strong
position
was
obvious
and
general
lee
sent
an
officer
of
his
staff
with
a
message
to
general
ewell
to
the
effect
that
he
could
see
the
enemy
flying
that
they
were
disorganized
and
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
push
on
vigorously
and
the
cemetery
heights
were
ours
footnote
the
officer
who
carried
the
order
is
our
authority
for
this
statement
just
about
the
moment
it
would
seem
when
this
order
was
dispatched
about
four
general
hill
who
had
joined
lee
on
the
ridge
received
a
message
from
general
ewell
requesting
him
hill
to
press
the
enemy
in
front
while
he
performed
the
same
operation
on
his
right
this
statement
is
taken
from
the
journal
of
colonel
freemantle
who
was
present
and
noted
the
hour
he
adds
the
pressure
was
accordingly
applied
in
a
mild
degree
but
the
enemy
were
too
strongly
posted
and
it
was
too
late
in
the
evening
for
a
regular
attack
general
ewell
an
officer
of
great
courage
and
energy
is
said
to
have
awaited
the
arrival
of
his
third
division
johnson
before
making
a
decisive
assault
upon
the
arrival
of
johnson
about
sunset
general
ewell
prepared
to
advance
and
seize
upon
the
eastern
terminus
of
the
cemetery
range
which
commanded
the
subsequent
federal
position
at
this
moment
general
lee
sent
him
word
to
proceed
with
his
troops
to
the
confederate
right
in
case
he
could
do
nothing
where
he
was
he
proceeded
to
general
lee
tent
thereupon
to
confer
with
him
and
the
result
was
that
it
was
agreed
to
first
assault
the
hill
on
the
right
it
was
now
however
after
midnight
and
the
attack
was
directed
by
lee
to
be
deferred
until
the
next
morning
it
was
certainly
unfortunate
that
the
advance
was
not
then
made
but
lee
in
his
report
attributes
no
blame
to
any
one
the
attack
he
says
was
not
pressed
that
afternoon
enemy
force
being
unknown
and
it
being
considered
advisable
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
rest
of
our
the
failure
to
press
the
enemy
immediately
after
their
retreat
with
the
view
of
driving
them
from
and
occupying
cemetery
heights
is
susceptible
of
an
explanation
which
seems
to
retrieve
the
southern
commander
and
his
subordinates
from
serious
criticism
the
federal
forces
had
been
driven
from
the
ground
north
and
west
of
gettysburg
but
it
was
seen
now
that
the
troops
thus
defeated
constituted
only
a
small
portion
of
general
meade
army
and
lee
had
no
means
of
ascertaining
with
any
degree
of
certainty
that
the
main
body
was
not
near
at
hand
the
fact
was
not
improbable
and
it
was
not
known
that
cemetery
hill
was
not
then
in
their
possession
the
wooded
character
of
the
ground
rendered
it
difficult
for
general
lee
even
from
his
elevated
position
on
seminary
ridge
to
discover
whether
the
heights
opposite
were
or
were
not
held
by
a
strong
force
infantry
were
visible
there
and
in
the
plain
in
front
the
cavalry
of
general
buford
were
drawn
up
as
though
ready
to
accept
battle
it
was
not
until
after
the
battle
that
it
was
known
that
the
heights
might
have
been
seized
upon
general
hancock
who
had
succeeded
reynolds
having
to
defend
them
but
a
single
brigade
this
fact
was
not
known
to
lee
the
sun
was
now
declining
and
the
advance
upon
cemetery
hill
was
deferred
until
the
next
day
when
on
the
next
morning
between
daybreak
and
sunrise
general
lee
accompanied
by
hill
longstreet
and
hood
ascended
to
the
same
point
on
seminary
ridge
and
reconnoitred
the
opposite
heights
through
his
they
were
seen
to
be
occupied
by
heavy
lines
of
infantry
and
numerous
artillery
the
moment
had
passed
the
rampart
in
his
front
bristled
with
bayonets
and
cannon
general
hancock
in
command
of
the
federal
advance
had
hastened
back
at
nightfall
to
general
meade
who
was
still
some
distance
in
rear
and
reported
the
position
to
be
an
excellent
one
for
receiving
the
southern
attack
upon
this
information
general
meade
had
at
once
acted
by
one
in
the
morning
his
headquarters
were
established
upon
the
ridge
and
when
lee
on
seminary
hill
opposite
was
reconnoitring
the
heights
the
great
bulk
of
the
federal
army
was
in
position
to
receive
his

the
adversaries
were
thus
face
to
face
and
a
battle
could
not
well
be
avoided
lee
and
his
troops
were
in
high
spirits
and
confident
of
victory
but
every
advantage
of
position
was
seen
to
be
on
the
side
of

xvi
the
two
armies
in
position
the
morning
of
the
of
july
had
arrived
and
the
two
armies
were
in
presence
of
each
other
and
ready
for
battle
the
question
was
which
of
the
great
adversaries
would
make
the
attack
general
meade
was
as
averse
to
assuming
the
offensive
as
his
opponent
lee
statement
on
this
subject
has
been
given
but
is
here
repeated
it
had
not
been
intended
to
fight
a
general
battle
he
wrote
at
such
a
distance
from
our
base
attacked
by
the
general
meade
said
before
the
war
committee
afterward
it
was
my
desire
to
fight
a
defensive
rather
than
an
offensive
battle
and
he
adds
the
obvious
explanation
that
he
was
satisfied
his
chances
of
success
were
greater
in
a
defensive
battle
than
an
offensive
one
there
was
this
great
advantage
however
on
the
federal
side
that
the
troops
were
on
their
own
soil
with
their
communications
uninterrupted
and
could
wait
while
general
lee
was
in
hostile
territory
a
considerable
distance
from
his
base
of
supplies
and
must
for
that
reason
either
attack
his
adversary
or
retreat
he
decided
to
attack
to
this
decision
he
seems
to
have
been
impelled
in
large
measure
by
the
extraordinary
spirit
of
his
troops
whose
demeanor
in
the
subsequent
struggle
was
said
by
a
federal
officer
to
resemble
that
of
men
drunk
on
champagne
general
longstreet
described
the
army
at
this
moment
as
able
from
the
singular
afflatus
which
bore
it
up
to
undertake
any
thing
and
this
sanguine
spirit
was
the
natural
result
of
a
nearly
unbroken
series
of
victories
at
fredericksburg
chancellorsville
and
in
the
preliminary
struggle
of
gettysburg
they
had
driven
the
enemy
before
them
in
disorder
and
on
the
night
succeeding
this
last
victory
both
officers
and
men
spoke
of
the
coming
battle
as
a
certainty
and
the
universal
feeling
in
the
army
was
one
of
profound
contempt
for
an
enemy
whom
they
had
beaten
so
constantly
and
under
so
many
disadvantages

colonel
freemantle
he
was
present

from
observation
contempt
of
an
adversary
is
dangerous
and
pride
goes
before

the
truth
of
these
pithy
adages
was
now
about
to
be
shown
general

it
is
said
shared
the
general
confidence
of
his
troops
and
was
carried
away
by
it
he
says
in

report
finding
ourselves
unexpectedly
confronted
by
the
federal
army
it
became
a
matter
of
difficulty
to
withdraw
through
the
mountain
with
our
large
trains
at
the
same
time
the
country
was
unfavorable
for
collecting
supplies
while
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
main
body
as
he
was
enabled
to
restrain
our
by
occupying
the
passes
of
the
mountains
with
regular
and
local
troops
a
battle
thus
became
in
a
measure
unavoidable
but
even
after
the
battle
when
the
southern
army
was
much
weaker
it
was
found
possible
without
much
difficulty
to
withdraw
through
the
mountains
with
the

a
stronger
motive
than
this
is
stated
in
the
next
sentence
of

by
the
successful
issue
of
the
engagement
of
the
first
day
and
in

of
the
valuable
results
that
would
ensue
from
the
defeat
of
the
army
of
general
it
was
thought
advisable
to
renew
the
attack
the
meaning
of
the
writer
of
these
words
is
plain
the
federal
troops
had
been
defeated
with
little
difficulty
in
the
first
day
fight
it
seemed
probable
that
a
more
serious
conflict
would
have
similar
results
and
a
decisive
victory
promised
to
end
the
war
general
meade
it
seems
scarcely
expected
to
be
attacked

anticipated

footnote

meade

however
it
was

for
what
it
is
worth
it
is
easy
after
the
event
for
the
smallest
to
criticise
the
greatest
under
whatever
influences
general
lee
determined
not
to
retreat
either
through
the
south
mountain
or
toward
emmetsburg
but
marshalled
his
army
for
an
attack
on
the
position
held
by
general
meade
the
southern
lines
were
drawn
up
on
seminary
ridge
and
on
the
ground
near
gettysburg
longstreet
corps
was
posted
on
the
right
opposite
the
federal
left
near
the
southern
end
of
cemetery
ridge
next
came
hill
corps
extending
along
the
crest
nearly
to
gettysburg
there
it
was
joined
by
ewell
line
which
passing
through
the
town
bent
round
adapting
itself
to
the
position
of
the
federal
right
which
held
the
high
ground
curving
round
in
the
shape
of
a
hook
at
the
north
end
of
the
ridge
the
federal
lines
thus
occupied
the
whole
cemetery
range
which
being
higher
commanded
seminary
ridge
and
consisted
counting
from
right
to
left
of
the
troops
of
generals
howard
hancock
sickles
sykes
and
sedgwick
the
two
latter
forming
a
strong
reserve
to
guard
the
federal
left
the
position
was
powerful
as
both
flanks
rested
upon
high
ground
which
gave
every
advantage
to
the
assailed
party
but
on
the
federal
left
an
accidental
error
it
seems
had
been
committed
by
general
sickles
he
had
advanced
his
line
to
a
ridge
in
front
of
the
main
range
which
appeared
to
afford
him
a
better
position
but
this
made
it
necessary
to
retire
the
left
wing
of
his
corps
to
cover
the
opening
in
that
direction
the
result
was
an
angle
the
effect
of
which
is
to
expose
troops
to
serious
danger
and
this
faulty
disposition
of
the
federal
left
seems
to
have
induced
general
lee
to
direct
his
main
attack
at
the
point
in
question
with
the
view
of
breaking
the
federal
line
and
seizing
upon
the
main
ridge
in
rear
in
front
of
general
longstreet
he
says
the
enemy
held
a
position
from
which
if
he
could
be
driven
it
was
thought
that
our
army
could
be
used
to
advantage
in
assailing
the
more
elevated
ground
beyond
in
order
to
coöperate
in
this
the
main
attack
ewell
was
ordered
at
the
same
time
to
assail
the
federal
right
toward
gettysburg
and
hill
directed
to
threaten
their
centre
and
if
there
were
an
opening
make
a
real
attack
these
demonstrations
against
the
enemy
right
and
centre
lee
anticipated
would
prevent
him
from
reënforcing
his
left
longstreet
would
thus
he
hoped
be
enabled
to
reach
the
west
of
the
ridge
in
rear
of
the
federal
line
and
general
meade
afterward
said
if
they
had
succeeded
in
occupying
that
it
would
have
prevented
me
from
holding
any
of
the
ground
which
i
subsequently
held
at
the
last
that
is
to
say
that
he
would
have
been
driven
from
the
entire
cemetery
range
such
was
the
position
of
the
two
adversaries
and
such
the
design
of
lee
on
the
of
july
when
the
real
struggle
was
about
to
begin
xvii
the
second
day
throughout
the
forenoon
of
the
day
about
to
witness
one
of
those
great
passages
of
arms
which
throw
so
bloody
a
glare
upon
the
pages
of
history
scarcely
a
sound
disturbed
the
silence
and
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
nearly
two
hundred
thousand
men
were
watching
each
other
across
the
narrow
valley
ready
at
the
word
to
advance
and
do
their
best
to
tear
each
other
to
pieces
during
all
these
long
hours
when
expectation
and
suspense
were
sufficient
to
try
the
stoutest
nerves
the
two
commanders
were
marshalling
their
lines
for
the
obstinate
struggle
which
was
plainly
at
hand
general
meade
who
knew
well
the
ability
of
his
opponent
was
seeing
in
person
to
every
thing
and
satisfying
himself
that
his
lines
were
in
order
to
receive
the
attack
lee
was
making
his
preparations
to
commence
the
assault
upon
which
there
could
be
little
doubt
the
event
of
the
whole
war
depended
from
the
gallantry
which
the
federal
troops
displayed
in
this
battle
they
must
have
been
in
good
heart
for
the
encounter
it
is
certain
that
the
southern
army
had
never
been
in
better
condition
for
a
decisive
conflict
we
have
spoken
of
the
extraordinary
confidence
of
the
men
in
themselves
and
in
their
commander
this
feeling
now
exhibited
itself
either
in
joyous
laughter
and
the
spirit
of
jesting
among
the
troops
or
in
an
air
of
utter
indifference
as
of
men
sure
of
the
result
and
giving
it
scarcely
a
thought
the
swarthy
gunners
still
begrimed
with
powder
from
the
work
of
the
day
before
lay
down
around
the
cannon
in
position
along
the
crest
and
passed
the
moments
in
uttering
witticisms
or
in
slumber
and
the
lines
of
infantry
seated
or
lying
musket
in
hand
were
as
careless
the
army
was
plainly
ready
and
would
respond
with
alacrity
to
lee
signal
of
the
result
no
human
being
in
this
force
of
more
than
seventy
thousand
men
seemed
to
have
the
least
doubt
lee
was
engaged
during
the
whole
morning
and
until
past
noon
in
maturing
his
preparations
for
the
assault
which
he
designed
making
against
the
enemy
left
in
front
of
longstreet
all
was
not
ready
until
about
four
in
the
afternoon
then
he
gave
the
word
and
longstreet
suddenly
opened
a
heavy
on
the
position
opposite
him
at
this
signal
the
guns
of
hill
opened
from
the
ridge
on
his
left
and
ewell
artillery
on
the
southern
left
in
front
of
gettysburg
thundered
in
response
under
cover
of
his
longstreet
then
advanced
his
lines
consisting
of
hood
division
on
the
right
and
mclawe
division
on
the
left
and
made
a
headlong
assault
upon
the
federal
forces
directly
in
his
front
the
point
aimed
at
was
the
salient
formed
by
the
projection
of
general
sickles
line
forward
to
the
high
ground
known
as
the
peach
orchard
here
as
we
have
already
said
the
federal
line
of
battle
formed
an
angle
with
the
left
wing
of
sickles
corps
bending
backward
so
as
to
cover
the
opening
between
his
line
and
the
main
crest
in
his
rear
hood
division
swung
round
to
assail
the
portion
of
the
line
thus
retired
and
so
rapid
was
the
movement
of
this
energetic
soldier
that
in
a
short
space
of
time
he
pushed
his
right
beyond
the
federal
left
flank
had
pierced
the
exposed
point
and
was
in
direct
proximity
to
the
crest
of
the
ridge
upon
the
possession
of
which
depended
the
fate
of
the
battle
hood
was
fully
aware
of
its
importance
and
lost
not
a
moment
in
advancing
to
seize
it
his
troops
largely
composed
of
those
famous
texas
regiments
which
lee
had
said
fought
grandly
and
nobly
and
upon
whom
he
relied
in
all
tight
places
responded
to
his
ardent
orders
a
small
run
was
crossed
the
men
rushed
up
the
slope
and
the
crest
was
almost
in
their
very
grasp
success
at
this
moment
would
have
decided
the
event
of
the
battle
of
gettysburg
and
in
all
probability
that
of
the
war
all
that
was
needed
was
a
single
brigade
upon
either
side
a
force
sufficient
to
seize
the
crest
for
neither
side
held
it
and
with
this
brigade
a
rare
good
fortune
or
rather
the
prompt
energy
of
a
single
officer
according
to
northern
historians
supplied
the
federal
commander
hood
line
was
rushing
up
with
cheers
to
occupy
the
crest
which
here
takes
the
form
of
a
separate
peak
and
is
known
as
little
round
top
when
general
warren
of
the
army
who
was
passing
saw
the
importance
of
the
position
and
determined
at
all
hazards
to
defend
it
he
accordingly
ordered
the
federal
which
had
used
the
peak
as
a
but
were
hastily
folding
up
their
flags
to
remain
where
they
were
laid
violent
hands
upon
a
brigade
which
was
passing
and
ordered
it
to
occupy
the
crest
and
when
hood
men
rushed
up
the
rocky
slope
with
yells
of
triumph
they
were
suddenly
met
by
a
fusillade
from
the
brigade
delivered
full
in
their
faces
a
violent
struggle
ensued
for
the
possession
of
the
heights
the
men
fought
hand
to
hand
on
the
summit
and
the
issue
remained
for
some
time
doubtful
at
last
it
was
decided
in
favor
of
the
federal
troops
who
succeeded
in
driving
hood
men
from
the
hill
the
summit
of
which
was
speedily
crowned
with
artillery
which
opened
a
destructive
fire
upon
the
retreating
southerners
they
fell
back
sullenly
leaving
the
ground
strewed
with
their
dead
and
wounded
hood
had
been
wounded
and
many
of
his
best
officers
had
fallen
for
an
instant
he
had
grasped
in
his
strong
hand
the
prize
which
would
have
been
worth
ten
times
the
amount
of
blood
shed
but
he
had
been
unable
to
retain
his
hold
he
was
falling
back
from
the
coveted
crest
pursued
by
that
roar
of
the
enemy
cannon
which
seemed
to
rejoice
in
his
discomfiture
an
obstinate
struggle
was
meanwhile
taking
place
in
the
vicinity
of
the
peach
orchard
where
the
left
of
hood
and
the
division
of
mclaws
had
struck
the
front
of
general
sickles
and
were
now
pressing
his
line
back
steadily
toward
the
ridge
in
his
rear
in
spite
of
resolute
resistance
the
federal
troops
at
this
point
were
pushed
back
to
a
in
the
rear
of
the
peach
orchard
and
following
up
this
advantage
longstreet
charged
them
and
broke
their
line
which
fell
back
in
disorder
toward
the
high
ground
in
rear
in
this
attack
mclaws
was
assisted
by
hill
right
division
that
of
anderson
with
this
force
longstreet
continued
to
press
forward
and
piercing
the
federal
line
seemed
about
to
inflict
upon
them
a
great
disaster
by
seizing
the
commanding
position
occupied
by
the
federal
left
nothing
appears
to
have
saved
them
at
this
moment
from
decisive
defeat
but
the
masterly
concentration
of
reënforcements
after
reënforcements
at
the
point
of
danger
the
heavy
reserves
under
generals
sykes
and
sedgwick
were
opposite
this
point
and
other
troops
were
hastened
forward
to
oppose
longstreet
this
reënforcement
was
continuous
throughout
the
entire
afternoon
in
spite
of
lee
demonstrations
in
other
quarters
to
direct
attention
general
meade
driven
by
necessity
continued
to
move
fresh
troops
incessantly
to
protect
his
left
and
success
finally
came
as
the
reward
of
his
energy
and
soldiership
longstreet
found
his
weary
troops
met
at
every
new
step
in
advance
by
fresh
lines
and
as
night
had
now
come
he
discontinued
the
attack
the
federal
lines
had
been
driven
considerably
beyond
the
point
which
they
had
held
before
the
assault
and
were
now
east
of
the
where
some
of
the
hardest
fighting
of
the
day
had
taken
place
but
in
spite
of
this
loss
of
ground
they
had
suffered
no
serious
disaster
and
above
all
lee
had
not
seized
upon
that
crest
of
the
ridge
which
was
the
keystone
of
the
position
thus
longstreet
attack
had
been
neither
a
success
nor
a
failure
he
had
not
accomplished
all
that
was
expected
but
he
had
driven
back
the
enemy
from
their
advanced
position
and
held
strong
ground
in
their
front
a
continuance
of
the
assault
was
therefore
deferred
until
the
next
day
night
having
now
come
and
general
longstreet
ordered
the
advance
to
cease
and
the
firing
to
be
discontinued
during
the
action
on
the
right
hill
had
continued
to
make
heavy
demonstrations
on
the
federal
centre
and
ewell
had
met
with
excellent
success
in
the
attack
directed
by
lee
to
be
made
against
the
right
this
was
posted
upon
the
semicircular
eminence
a
little
southeast
of
gettysburg
and
the
federal
works
were
attacked
by
ewell
about
sunset
with
early
division
on
his
right
and
johnson
on
his
left
ewell
advanced
across
the
open
ground
in

of
a
heavy
the
men
rushed
up
the
slope
and
in
a
brief
space
of
time
the
federal
artillerists
and
infantry
were
driven
from
the
works
which
at
nightfall
remained
in
ewell
hands
such
had
been
the
fate
of
the
second
struggle
around
gettysburg
the
moon
which
rose
just
as
the
fighting
terminated
threw
its
ghastly
glare
upon
a
field
where
neither
side
had
achieved
full
success
lee
had
not
failed
and
he
had
not
succeeded
he
had
aimed
to
drive
the
federal
forces
from
the
cemetery
range
and
had
not
been
able
to
effect
that
object
but
they
had
been
forced
back
upon
both
their
right
and
left
and
a
substantial
advantage
seemed
thus
to
have
been
gained
that
the
confederate
success
was
not
complete
seems
to
have
resulted
from
the
failure
to
seize
the
hill
the
crisis
of
the
battle
had
undoubtedly
been
the
moment
when
hood
was
so
near
capturing
this
position
in
reference
to
the
importance
of
which
we
quoted
general
meade
own
words
it
was
saved
to
the
federal
army
by
the
presence
of
mind
it
seems
of
a
single
officer
and
the
gallantry
of
a
single
brigade
such
are
the
singular
chances
of
battle
in
which
the
smallest
causes
so
often
effect
the
greatest
results
general
lee
in
company
with
general
hill
had
during
the
battle
occupied
his
former
position
on
seminary
ridge
near
the
centre
of
his
line
quietly
seated
for
the
greater
portion
of
the
time
upon
the
stump
of
a
tree
and
looking
thoughtfully
toward
the
opposite
heights
which
longstreet
was
endeavoring
to
storm
his
demeanor
was
entirely
calm
and
composed
an
observer
would
not
have
concluded
that
he
was
the
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
to
his
eyes
and
rising
said
a
few
words
to
general
hill
or
general
long
of
his
staff
after
this
brief
colloquy
he
would
return
to
his
seat
on
the
stump
and
continue
to
direct
his
glass
toward
the
wooded
heights
held
by
the
enemy
a
notable
circumstance
and
one
often
observed
upon
other
occasions
was
that
during
the
entire
action
he
scarcely
sent
an
order
during
the
time
longstreet
was
engaged
from
about
four
until
night
he
sent
but
one
message
and
received
but
one
report
having
given
full
directions
to
his
able
lieutenants
and
informed
them
of
the
objects
which
he
desired
to
attain
he
on
this
occasion
as
upon
others
left
the
execution
of
his
orders
to
them
relying
upon
their
judgment
and
ability
a
singular
incident
occurred
at
this
moment
which
must
have
diverted
lee
temporarily
from
his
abstracted
mood
in
the
midst
of
the
most
furious
part
of
the
cannonade
when
the
air
was
filled
with
exploding
shell
a
confederate
band
of
music
between
the
opposing
lines
just
below
general
lee
position
began
defiantly
playing
polkas
and
waltzes
on
their
instruments
the
incident
was
strange
in
the
midst
of
such
a
the
bloody
seemed
turned
into
a
ballroom
with
nightfall
the
firing
sunk
to
silence
the
moon
had
risen
and
the
pale
light
now
lit
up
the
faces
of
the
dead
and
wounded
of
both
sides
lee
first
great
assault
had
failed
to
secure
the
full
results
which
he
had
anticipated
from
it
xviii
the
last
charge
at
gettysburg
the
weird
hours
of
the
moonlit
night
succeeding
the
second
day
at
gettysburg
witnessed
a
consultation
between
lee
and
his
principal
officers
as
to
the
propriety
of
renewing
the
attack
on
the
federal
position
or
falling
back
in
the
direction
of
the
potomac
in
favor
of
the
latter
course
there
seemed
to
be
many
good
reasons
the
supplies
both
of
provisions
and
ammunition
were
running
short
the
army
although
unshaken
had
lost
heavily
in
the
attack
in
the
event
of
defeat
now
its
situation
might
become
perilous
and
the
destruction
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
was
likely
to
prove
that
of
the
southern
cause
on
the
other
hand
the
results
of
the
day
fighting
if
not
decisive
had
been
highly
encouraging
on
both
the
federal
wings
the
confederates
had
gained
ground
which
they
still
held
longstreet
line
was
in
advance
of
the
peach
orchard
held
by
the
enemy
on
the
morning
of
the
second
and
ewell
was
still
rooted
firmly
it
seemed
in
their
works
near
gettysburg
these
advantages
were
certainly
considerable
and
promised
success
to
the
southern
arms
if
the
assault
were
renewed
but
the
most
weighty
consideration
prompting
a
renewal
of
the
attack
was
the
condition
of
the
troops
they
were
undismayed
and
unshaken
either
in
spirit
or
efficiency
and
were
known
both
to
expect
and
to
desire
a
resumption
of
the
assault
even
after
the
subsequent
charge
of
pickett
which
resulted
so
disastrously
the
ragged
infantry
were
heard
exclaiming
we
not
lost
confidence
in
the
old
man
this
day
work
wo
do
him
no
harm
uncle
robert
will
get
us
into
washington
yet
add
to
this
the
fact
that
the
issue
of
the
second
day
had
stirred
up
in
lee
himself
all
the
martial
ardor
of
his
nature
and
there
never
lived
a
more
thorough
when
he
was
fully
aroused
than
the
virginian
all
this
soldiership
of
the
man
revolted
at
the
thought
of
retreating
and
abandoning
his
great
enterprise
he
looked
on
the
one
hand
at
his
brave
army
ready
at
the
word
to
again
advance
upon
the
enemy
at
that
enemy
scarce
able
on
the
previous
day
to
hold
his
position
and
weighing
every
circumstance
in
his
comprehensive
mind
which
looked
before
and
after
lee
determined
on
the
next
morning
to
try
a
decisive
assault
upon
the
federal
troops
to
storm
if
possible
the
cemetery
range
and
at
one
great
blow
terminate
the
campaign
and
the
war
the
powerful
influences
which
we
have
mentioned
coöperating
shaped
the
decision
to
which
lee
had
come
he
would
not
retreat
but
fight
the
campaign
should
not
be
abandoned
without
at
least
one
great
charge
upon
the
federal
position
and
orders
were
now
given
for
a
renewal
of
the
attack
on
the
next
morning
the
general
plan
of
attack
lee
says
was
unchanged
except
that
one
division
and
two
brigades
of
hill
corps
were
ordered
to
support
longstreet
from
these
words
it
is
obvious
that
lee
main
aim
now
as
on
the
preceding
day
was
to
force
back
the
federal
left
in
front
of
longstreet
and
seize
the
high
ground
commanding
the
whole
ridge
in
flank
and
reverse
to
this
end
longstreet
was
reënforced
and
the
great
assault
was
evidently
intended
to
take
place
in
that
quarter
but
circumstances
caused
an
alteration
as
will
be
seen
in
lee
plans
the
centre
thus
weakened
was
from
stress
of
events
to
become
the
point
of
decisive
struggle
the
assaults
of
the
previous
day
had
been
directed
against
the
two
extremities
of
the
enemy
the
assault
of
the
third
day
which
would
decide
the
fate
of
the
battle
and
the
campaign
was
to
be
the
furious
rush
of
pickett
division
of
virginian
troops
at
the
centre
on
cemetery
hill
a
preliminary
conflict
brought
on
by
the
federal
commander
took
place
early
in
the
morning
ewell
had
continued
throughout
the
night
to
hold
the
enemy
breastworks
on
their
right
from
which
he
had
driven
them
in
the
evening
as
dawn
approached
now
he
was
about
to
resume
the
attack
and
in
obedience
to
lee
orders
attempt
to
dislodge
the
enemy
from
other
parts
of
the
ridge
when
general
meade
took
the
initiative
and
opened
upon
him
a
furious
fire
of
cannon
which
was
followed
by
a
determined
infantry
charge
to
regain
the
hill
ewell
held
his
ground
with
the
obstinate
nerve
which
characterized
him
and
the
battle
raged
about
four
hours
that
is
until
about
eight
at
that
time
however
the
pressure
of
the
enemy
became
too
heavy
to
stand
general
meade
succeeded
in
driving
ewell
from
the
hill
and
the
federal
lines
were
reëstablished
on
the
commanding
ground
which
they
had
previously
occupied
this
event
probably
deranged
in
some
degree
general
plans
which
contemplated
as
we
have
seen
an
attack
by
ewell
contemporaneous
with
the
main
assault
by
longstreet
ewell
was
in
no
condition
at
this
moment
to
assume
the
offensive
again
and
the
pause
in
the
fighting
appears
to
have
induced
general
lee
to
reflect
and
modify
his
plans
throughout
the
hours
succeeding
the
struggle
lee
attended
by
generals
hill
and
longstreet
and
their
rode
along
the
lines
reconnoitring
the
opposite
heights
and
the
cavalcade
was
more
than
once
saluted
by
bullets
from
the
enemy
and
an
occasional
shell
the
result
of
the
reconnoissance
seems
to
have
been
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
left
now
strengthened
by
breastworks
behind
which
powerful
reserves
lay
waiting
was
not
a
favorable
point
for
attack
general
meade
no
doubt
expected
an
assault
there
and
aroused
to
a
sense
of
his
danger
by
the
confederate
success
of
the
previous
day
had
made
every
preparation
to
meet
a
renewal
of
the
movement
the
confederate
left
and
centre
remained
but
it
seemed
injudicious
to
think
of
attacking
from
ewell
position
a
concentration
of
the
southern
force
there
would
result
in
a
dangerous
separation
of
the
two
wings
of
the
army
and
in
the
event
of
failure
the
enemy
would
have
no
difficulty
in
descending
and
turning
lee
right
flank
and
thus
interposing
between
him
and
the
potomac
the
centre
only
was
left
and
to
this
lee
now
turned
his
attention
a
determined
rush
with
a
strong
column
at
cemetery
hill
in
his
front
might
wrest
that
point
from
the
enemy
then
their
line
would
be
pierced
the
army
would
follow
lee
would
be
rooted
on
this
commanding
ground
directly
between
the
two
federal
wings
upon
which
their
own
guns
might
be
turned
and
the
defeat
of
general
meade
must
certainly
follow
such
were
doubtless
the
reflections
of
general
lee
as
he
rode
along
the
seminary
range
scanning
through
his
the
line
of
the
federal
works
his
decision
was
made
and
orders
were
given
by
him
to
prepare
the
column
for
the
assault
for
the
hard
work
at
hand
pickett
division
of
virginian
troops
which
had
just
arrived
and
were
fresh
was
selected
these
were
to
be
supported
by
heth
division
of
north
carolina
troops
under
general
pettigrew
who
was
to
move
on
pickett
left
and
a
brigade
of
hill
under
general
wilcox
was
to
cover
the
right
of
the
advancing
column
and
protect
it
from
a
flank
attack
the
advance
of
the
charging
column
was
preceded
by
a
tremendous
directed
from
seminary
ridge
at
the
enemy
left
and
centre
this
began
about
an
hour
past
noon
and
the
amount
of
thunder
thus
unloosed
will
be
understood
from
the
statement
that
lee
employed
one
hundred
and
pieces
of
artillery
and
the
enemy
replied
with
eighty
in
all
hundred
and
guns
all
discharging
at
the
same
time
for
nearly
two
hours
this
frightful
continued
the
harsh
roar
reverberating
ominously
in
the
gorges
of
the
hills
and
thrown
back
in
crash
after
crash
from
the
rocky
slopes
of
the
two
ridges
to
describe
this
fire
afterward
the
cool
soldier
general
hancock
could
find
no
other
but
the
word
their
he
says
was
the
most
terrific
cannonade
i
ever
witnessed
and
the
most
prolonged
it
was
a
most
terrific
and
appalling
cannonade
one
possibly
hardly
ever
paralleled
while
this
was
in
progress
the
charging
column
was
being
formed
on
the
west
of
seminary
ridge
opposite
the
federal
centre
on
cemetery
hill
pickett
drew
up
his
line
with
kemper
and
garnett
brigades
in
front
and
armistead
brigade
in
rear
the
brigade
under
general
wilcox
took
position
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
was
placed
the
division
under
pettigrew
which
was
to
participate
in
the
charge
the
force
numbered
between
twelve
and
fifteen
thousand
men
but
as
will
be
seen
nearly
in
the
beginning
of
the
action
pickett
was
left
alone
and
thus
his
force
of
about
five
thousand
was
all
that
went
forward
to
pierce
the
centre
of
the
federal
army
the
opposing
ridges
at
this
point
are
about
one
mile
asunder
and
across
this
space
pickett
moved
at
the
word
his
line
advancing
slowly
and
perfectly
dressed
with
its
red
flying
and
the
sunshine
darting
from
the
and
bayonets
the
two
armies
were
silent
concentrating
their
whole
attention
upon
this
slow
and
ominous
advance
of
men
who
seemed
in
no
haste
and
resolved
to
allow
nothing
to
arrest
them
when
the
column
had
reached
a
point
about
midway
between
the
opposing
heights
the
federal
artillery
suddenly
opened
a
furious
fire
upon
them
which
inflicted
considerable
loss
this
however
had
no
effect
upon
the
troops
who
continued
to
advance
slowly
in
the
same
excellent
order
without
exhibiting
any
desire
to
return
the
fire
it
was
impossible
to
witness
this
steady
and
march
under
heavy
fire
without
feeling
admiration
for
the
soldiership
of
the
troops
who
made
it
where
shell
tore
gaps
in
the
ranks
the
men
quietly
closed
up
and
the
hostile
front
advanced
in
the
same
ominous
silence
toward
the
slope
where
the
real
struggle
all
felt
would
soon
begin
they
were
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
hill
when
suddenly
a
rapid
thundered
on
their
right
and
shell
and
canister
from
nearly
fifty
pieces
of
artillery
swept
the
southern
line
enfilading
it
and
for
an
instant
throwing
the
right
into
some
disorder
this
disappeared
at
once
however
the
column
closed
up
and
continued
to
advance
unmoved
toward
the
height
at
last
the
moment
came
the
steady
step
had
become
quick
time
this
had
changed
to
then
the
column
rushed
headlong
at
the
enemy
breastworks
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
as
they
did
so
the
real
thunder
began
a
fearful
fire
of
musketry
burst
forth
and
struck
them
in
the
face
and
this
hurricane
scattered
the
raw
troops
of
pettigrew
as
leaves
are
scattered
by
a
wind
that
whole
portion
of
the
line
gave
way
in
disorder
and
fled
from
the
field
which
was
strewed
with
their
dead
and
as
the
other
supports
had
not
kept
up
the
virginians
under
pickett
were
left
alone
to
breast
the
tempest
which
had
now
burst
upon
them
in
all
its
fury
they
returned
the
fire
from
the
breastworks
in
their
front
with
a
heavy
volley
and
then
with
loud
cheers
dashed
at
the
enemy
works
which
they
reached
stormed
and
took
possession
of
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
their
loss
however
was
frightful
garnett
was
killed
armistead
fell
mortally
wounded
as
he
leaped
on
the
breastworks
cheering
and
waving
his
hat
kemper
was
shot
and
disabled
and
the
ranks
of
the
virginians
were
thinned
to
a
handful
the
men
did
not
however
pause
the
enemy
had
partially
retreated
from
their
first
line
of
breastworks
to
a
second
and
stronger
one
about
sixty
yards
beyond
and
near
the
crest
and
here
the
federal
reserve
as
northern
writers
state
was
drawn
up
four
deep
this
line
bristling
with
bayonets
and
cannon
the
virginians
now
charged
in
the
desperate
attempt
to
storm
it
with
the
bayonet
and
pierce
in
a
decisive
manner
the
centre
of
the
federal
army
but
the
work
was
too
great
for
their
powers
as
they
made
their
brave
rush
they
were
met
by
a
concentrated
fire
full
in
their
faces
and
on
both
flanks
at
the
same
moment
this
fire
did
not
so
much
cause
them
to
lose
heart
as
literally
hurl
them
back
before
it
the
whole
charging
column
seemed
to
melt
and
disappear
the
bravest
saw
now
that
further
fighting
was
useless
that
the
works
in
their
front
could
not
be
stormed
and
with
the
frightful
fire
of
the
enemy
still
tearing
their
lines
to
pieces
the
poor
remnants
of
the
brave
division
retreated
from
the
hill
as
they
fell
back
sullenly
like
from
whom
their
prey
had
been
snatched
just
as
it
was
in
their
grasp
the
enemy
pursued
them
with
a
destructive
fire
both
of
cannon
and
musketry
which
mowed
down
large
numbers
if
large
numbers
indeed
can
be
said
to
have
been
left
the
command
had
been
nearly
annihilated
three
generals
fourteen
and
of
the
men
were
dead
wounded
or
prisoners
the
virginians
had
done
all
that
could
be
done
by
soldiers
they
had
advanced
undismayed
into
the
focus
of
a
fire
unsurpassed
perhaps
in
the
annals
of
war
had
fought
bayonet
to
bayonet
had
left
the
ground
strewed
with
their
dead
and
the

at
this
moment
when
his
hopes
were

reversed
and
his

great
blow
at

had

excited
the
admiration
of
all
who
witnessed

one
of
the

glories

his
memory
seeing
from
his
place

the
unfortunate
results
of
the
attack
he
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
forward
to
meet

retreating

was

of

preserved
the

placidity
and
cheerfulness
the
hurry
and
confusion
of
the
scene
seemed
not
to
move
him
in
any
manner
and
he
rode
slowly
to
and

saying
in
his
grave
kindly
voice
to
the
men
all
this
will
come
right
in
the
end
we
talk
it
over
afterward

in

of
wounded
passed
him
some
stretched
on

which
men
wearing
the

badge
of

were
bearing
to
the

others
limping
along

from
hurts
more
or

serious
to
the
badly
wounded
lee
uttered
words
of
sympathy
and
kindness
to
those
but
slightly
injured
he
said
come
bind
up
your
wound
and
take
a
musket
adding
my
friend
as
was
his
habit
an
evidence
of
his
composure
and
absence
of
flurry
was
presented
by
a
slight
incident
an
officer
near
him
was
striking
his
horse
violently
for
becoming
frightened
and
unruly
at
the
bursting
of
a
shell
when
general
lee
seeing
that
the
horse
was
terrified
and
the
punishment
would
do
no
good
said
in
tones
of
friendly
remonstrance
whip
him
captain
do
whip
him
i
got
just
such
a
foolish
horse
myself
and
whipping
does
no
good
meanwhile
the
men
continued
to
stream
back
pursued
still
by
that
triumphant
roar
of
the
enemy
artillery
which
swept
the
whole
valley
and
slope
of
seminary
ridge
with
shot
and
shell
lee
was
everywhere
encouraging
them
and
they
responded
by
taking
off
their
hats
and
cheering
him
even
the
wounded
joining
in
this
ceremony
although
exposing
himself
with
entire
indifference
to
the
heavy
fire
he
advised
colonel
freemantle
as
that
officer
states
to
shelter
himself
saying
this
has
been
a
sad
day
for
us
colonel
a
sad
day
but
we
ca
expect
always
to
gain
victories
as
he
was
thus
riding
about
in
the
fringe
of
woods
general
wilcox
who
about
the
time
of
pickett
repulse
had
advanced
and
speedily
been
thrown
back
with
loss
rode
up
and
said
almost
sobbing
as
he
spoke
that
his
brigade
was
nearly
destroyed
lee
held
out
his
hand
to
him
as
he
was
speaking
and
grasping
the
hand
of
his
subordinate
in
a
friendly
manner
replied
with
great
gentleness
and
kindness
never
mind
general
all
this
has
been
fault
it
is
who
have
lost
this
fight
and
you
must
help
me
out
of
it
in
the
best
way
you
can
this
supreme
calmness
and
composure
in
the
rapidly
communicated
itself
to
the
troops
who
soon
got
together
again
and
lay
down
quietly
in
line
of
battle
in
the
fringe
of
woods
along
the
crest
of
the
ridge
where
lee
placed
them
as
they
came
up
in
front
of
them
the
guns
used
in
the
great
cannonade
were
still
in
position
and
lee
was
evidently
making
every
preparation
in
his
power
for
the
highly
probable
event
of
an
instant
assault
upon
him
in
his
disordered
condition
by
the
enemy
it
was
obvious
that
the
situation
of
affairs
at
the
moment
was
such
as
to
render
such
an
attack
highly
perilous
to
the
southern
troops
and
a
sudden
cheering
which
was
now
heard
running
along
the
lines
of
the
enemy
on
the
opposite
heights
seemed
clearly
to
indicate
that
their
forces
were
moving
every
preparation
possible
under
the
circumstances
was
made
to
meet
the
anticipated
assault
the
repulsed
troops
of
pickett
like
the
rest
of
the
army
were
ready
and
even
eager
for
of
the
attack
but
it
did
not
come
the
cheering
was
afterward
ascertained
to
have
been
simply
the
greeting
of
the
men
to
some
one
of
their
officers
as
he
rode
along
the
lines
and
night
fell
without
any
attempt
on
the
federal
side
to
improve
their
success
that
success
was
indeed
sufficient
and
little
would
have
been
gained
and
perhaps
much
perilled
by
a
lee
was
not
defeated
but
he
had
not
succeeded
general
meade
could
with
propriety
refrain
from
an
attack
the
battle
of
gettysburg
had
been
a
federal
victory
thus
had
ended
the
last
great
conflict
of
arms
on
northern
soil
in
a
decisive
if
not
a
crushing
repulse
of
the
southern
arms
the
chain
of
events
has
been
so
closely
followed
in
the
foregoing
pages
and
the
movements
of
the
two
armies
have
been
described
with
such
detail
that
any
further
comment
or
illustration
is
unnecessary
the
opposing
armies
had
been
handled
with
skill
and
energy
the
men
had
never
fought
better
and
the
result
seems
to
have
been
decided
rather
by
an
occult
decree
of
providence
than
by
any
other
circumstance
the
numbers
on
each
side
were
nearly
the
same
or
differed
so
slightly
that
in
view
of
past
conflicts
fought
with
much
greater
odds
in
favor
of
the
one
side
they
might
be
regarded
as
equal
the
southern
army
when
it
approached
gettysburg
numbered
thousand
bayonets
and
the
cavalry
and
artillery
probably
made
the
entire
force
about
eighty
thousand
general
meade
statement
is
that
his
own
force
was
about
one
hundred
thousand
the
federal
loss
was
thousand
one
hundred
and
ninety
the
southern
losses
were
also
severe
but
can
not
be
ascertained
they
must
have
amounted
however
to
at
least
as
large
a
number
even
larger
perhaps
as
an
attacking
army
always
suffers
more
heavily
than
one
that
is
attacked
what
is
certain
however
is
that
the
southern
army
if
diminished
in
numbers
and
strength
was
still
unshaken

lee
retreat
across
the
potomac
lee
commenced
his
retreat
in
the
direction
of
the
potomac
on
the
night
of
the
of
july
that
the
movement
did
not
begin
earlier
is
the
best
proof
of
the
continued
efficiency
of
his
army
and
his
own
willingness
to
accept
battle
if
the
enemy
were
inclined
to
offer
it
after
the
failure
of
the
attack
on
the
federal
centre
he
had
withdrawn
ewell
from
his
position
southeast
of
gettysburg
and
forming
a
continuous
line
of
battle
on
seminary
ridge
awaited
the
anticipated
assault
of
general
meade
what
the
result
of
such
an
assault
would
have
been
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
the
theory
that
an
attack
would
have
terminated
in
the
certain
rout
of
the
southern
army
has
nothing
whatever
to
support
it
the
of
lee
army
was
untouched
the
men
instead
of
being
discouraged
by
the
tremendous
conflicts
of
the
preceding
days
were
irate
defiant
and
ready
to
resume
the
struggle
foreign
officers
present
at
the
time
testify
fully
upon
this
point
describing
the
demeanor
of
the
troops
as
all
that
could
be
desired
in
soldiers
and
general
longstreet
afterward
stated
that
with
his
two
divisions
under
hood
and
mclaws
and
his
powerful
artillery
he
was
confident
had
the
enemy
attacked
of
inflicting
upon
them
a
blow
as
heavy
as
that
which
they
had
inflicted
upon
pickett
the
testimony
of
general
meade
himself
fully
corroborates
these
statements
when
giving
his
evidence
afterward
before
the
war
committee
he
said
my
opinion
is
now
that
general
lee
evacuated
that
position
from
the
fear
that
he
would
be
dislodged
from
it
by
any
active
operations
on
my
but
that
he
was
fearful
that
a
force
would
be
sent
to
harper
ferry
to
cut
off
his
communications
that
was
what
caused
him
to
retire
when
asked
the
question
did
you
discover
after
the
battle
of
gettysburg
any
symptoms
of
demoralization
in
lee
army
general
meade
replied
no
sir
i
saw
nothing
of
that
kind
footnote
report
of
committee
on
conduct
of
war
part
page
there
was
indeed
no
good
reason
why
general
lee
should
feel
any
extreme
solicitude
for
the
safety
of
his
army
which
after
all
its
losses
still
numbered
more
than
fifty
thousand
troops
and
with
that
force
of
veteran
combatants
experience
told
him
he
could
count
upon
holding
at
bay
almost
any
force
which
the
enemy
could
bring
against
him
at
chancellorsville
with
a
less
number
he
had
nearly
routed
a
larger
army
than
general
meade
if
the
of
the
men
remained
unbroken
he
had
the
right
to
feel
secure
now
and
we
have
shown
that
the
troops
were
as
full
of
fight
as
ever
the
exclamations
of
the
ragged
infantry
overheard
by
colonel
freemantle
expressed
the
sentiment
of
the
whole
army
recoiling
from
the
fatal
charge
on
cemetery
hill
and
still
followed
by
the
terrible
fire
they
had
heart
to
shout
defiantly
we
not
lost
confidence
in
the
old
man
this
day
work
wo
do
him
no
harm
uncle
robert
will
get
us
into
washington
yet
you
bet
he
will
lee
reasons
for
retiring
toward
the
potomac
were
unconnected
with
the
of
his
army
the
difficulty
of
procuring
supplies
he
says
rendered
it
impossible
to
continue
longer
where
we
were
what
he
especially
needed
was
ammunition
his
supply
of
which
had
been
nearly
exhausted
by
the
three
days
fighting
and
it
was
impossible
to
count
upon
new
supplies
of
these
essential
stores
now
that
the
enemy
were
in
a
condition
to
interrupt
his
communications
in
the
direction
of
harper
ferry
and
williamsport
the
danger
to
which
the
army
was
thus
exposed
was
soon
shown
not
to
have
been
overrated
general
meade
promptly
sent
a
force
to
occupy
harper
ferry
and
a
body
of
his
cavalry
hastening
across
the
south
mountain
reached
the
potomac
near
falling
waters
where
they
destroyed
a
pontoon
bridge
laid
there
for
the
passage
of
the
southern
army
lee
accordingly
resolved
to
retire
and
after
remaining
in
line
of
battle
on
seminary
ridge
throughout
the
evening
and
night
of
the
and
the
whole
of
the
during
which
time
he
was
busy
burying
his
dead
began
to
withdraw
by
the
fairfield
and
chambersburg
roads
on
the
night
of
this
latter
day
the
movement
was
deliberate
and
without
marks
of
haste
the
not
leaving
the
vicinity
of
gettysburg
until
the
morning
of
the
those
who
looked
upon
the
southern
army
at
this
time
can
testify
that
the
spirit
of
the
troops
was
unsubdued
they
had
been
severely
checked
but
there
every
thing
had
ended
weary
covered
with
dust
with
wounds
whose
bandages
were
soaked
in
blood
the
men
tramped
on
in
excellent
spirits
and
were
plainly
ready
to
take
position
at
the
first
word
from
lee
and
meet
any
attack
of
the
enemy
with
a
nerve
as
perfect
as
when
they
had
advanced
for
the
reasons
stated
by
himself
general
meade
did
not
attack
he
had
secured
substantial
victory
by
awaiting
lee
assault
on
strong
ground
and
was
unwilling
now
to
risk
a
disaster
such
as
he
had
inflicted
by
attacking
lee
in
position
the
enthusiasm
of
the
authorities
at
washington
was
not
shared
by
the
cool
commander
of
the
federal
army
he
perfectly
well
understood
the
real
strength
and
condition
of
his
adversary
and
seems
never
to
have
had
any
intention
of
striking
at
him
unless
a
change
of
circumstances
gave
him
some
better
prospect
of
success
than
he
could
see
at
that
time
the
retrograde
movement
of
the
southern
army
now
began
lee
trains
retiring
by
way
of
chambersburg
and
his
infantry
over
the
fairfield
road
in
the
direction
of
hagerstown
general
meade
at
first
moved
directly
on
the
track
of
his
enemy
the
design
of
a
stern
chase
was
however
speedily
abandoned
by
the
federal
commander
who
changed
the
direction
of
his
march
and
moved
southward
toward
frederick
when
near
that
point
he
crossed
the
south
mountain
went
toward
sharpsburg
and
on
the
of
july
found
himself
in
front
of
the
southern
army
near
williamsport
where
lee
had
formed
line
of
battle
to
receive
his
adversary
attack
the
deliberate
character
of
general
meade
movements
sufficiently
indicates
the
disinclination
he
felt
to
place
himself
directly
in
his
opponent
front
and
thus
receive
the
full
weight
of
his
attack
there
is
reason
indeed
to
believe
that
nothing
could
better
have
suited
the
views
of
general
meade
than
for
lee
to
have
passed
the
potomac
before
his
arrival
which
event
would
have
signified
the
entire
abandonment
of
the
campaign
of
invasion
leaving
victory
on
the
side
of
the
federal
army
but
the
elements
seemed
to
conspire
to
bring
on
a
second
struggle
despite
the
reluctance
of
both
commanders
the
recent
rains
had
swollen
the
potomac
to
such
a
degree
as
to
render
it
unfordable
and
as
the
pontoon
near
williamsport
had
been
destroyed
by
the
federal
cavalry
lee
was
brought
to
bay
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
where
on
the
as
we
have
said
general
meade
found
him
in
line
of
battle
lee
demeanor
at
this
critical
moment
was
perfectly
undisturbed
and
exhibited
no
traces
whatever
of
anxiety
though
he
must
have
felt
much
in
his
rear
was
a
swollen
river
and
in
his
front
an
adversary
who
had
been
reënforced
with
a
considerable
body
of
troops
and
now
largely
outnumbered
him
in
the
event
of
battle
and
defeat
the
situation
of
the
southern
army
must
be
perilous
in
the
extreme
nothing
would
seem
to
be
left
it
in
that
event
but
surrender
or
dispersion
among
the
western
mountains
where
the
detached
bodies
would
be
hunted
down
in
detail
and
destroyed
or
captured
confidence
in
himself
and
his
men
remained
however
with
general
lee
and
with
his
line
extending
from
near
hagerstown
to
a
point
east
of
williamsport
he
calmly
awaited
the
falling
of
the
river
resolved
doubtless
if
in
the
mean
time
the
enemy
attacked
him
to
fight
to
the
last
gasp
for
the
preservation
of
his
army
no
attack
was
made
by
general
meade
who
arriving
in
front
of
lee
on
the
did
no
more
on
that
day
than
feel
along
the
southern
lines
for
a
point
to
assault
on
the
next
day
he
assembled
a
council
of
war
and
laid
the
question
before
them
whether
or
not
it
were
advisable
to
make
an
assault
the
votes
of
the
officers
were
almost
unanimously
against
it
as
lee
position
seemed
strong
and
the
spirit
of
his
army
defiant
and
the
day
passed
without
any
attempt
of
the
federal
army
to
dislodge
its
adversary
while
general
meade
was
thus
hesitating
lee
was
acting
a
portion
of
the
pontoon
destroyed
by
the
enemy
was
recovered
new
boats
were
built
and
a
practicable
bridge
was
completed
near
falling
waters
by
the
evening
of
the
the
river
had
also
commenced
falling
and
by
this
time
was
fordable
near
williamsport
toward
dawn
on
the
the
army
commenced
moving
in
the
midst
of
a
violent
across
the
river
at
both
points
and
lee
sitting
his
horse
upon
the
bank
superintended
the
operation
as
was
his
habit
on
occasions
of
emergency
loss
of
rest
and
fatigue
with
that
feeling
of
suspense
unavoidable
under
the
circumstances
had
impaired
the
energies
of
even
his
superb
physical
constitution
as
the
bulk
of
the
of
the
army
safely
passed
over
the
shaky
bridge
which
lee
had
looked
at
with
some
anxiety
as
it
swayed
to
and
fro
lashed
by
the
current
he
uttered
a
sigh
of
relief
and
a
great
weight
seemed
taken
from
his
shoulders
seeing
his
fatigue
and
exhaustion
general
stuart
gave
him
some
coffee
he
drank
it
with
avidity
and
declared
as
he
handed
back
the
cup
that
nothing
had
ever
refreshed
him
so
much
when
general
meade
who
is
said
to
have
resolved
on
an
attack
in
spite
of
the
opposition
of
his
officers
looked
on
the
morning
of
the
toward
the
position
held
on
the
previous
evening
by
the
southern
army
he
saw
that
the
works
were
deserted
the
army
of
northern
virginia
had
vanished
from
the
hills
on
which
it
had
been
posted
and
was
at
that
moment
crossing
the
potomac
pressing
on
its
track
toward
falling
waters
the
federal
cavalry
came
up
with
the
rear
and
in
the
skirmish
which
ensued
fell
the
brave
pettigrew
who
had
supported
pickett
in
the
great
charge
at
gettysburg
where
he
had
waved
his
hat
in
front
of
his
men
and
in
spite
of
a
painful
wound
done
all
in
his
power
to
rally
his
troops
with
this
exception
and
a
few
captures
resulting
from
accident
the
army
sustained
no
losses
the
movement
across
the
potomac
had
been
effected
in
face
of
the
whole
federal
army
as
successfully
as
though
that
army
had
been
a
hundred
miles
distant
footnote
upon
this
point
different
statements
were
subsequently
made
by
generals
lee
and
meade
and
lee
reply
to
the
statements
of
his
opponent
is
here
given
headquarters
army
northern
virginia
cooper
adjutant
and
richmond
general
i
have
seen
in
northern
papers
what
purported
to
be
an
official
dispatch
from
general
meade
stating
that
he
had
captured
a
brigade
of
infantry
two
pieces
of
artillery
two
caissons
and
a
large
number
of
as
this
army
retired
to
the
south
bank
of
the
potomac
on
the
and
inst
this
dispatch
has
been
copied
into
the
richmond
papers
and
as
its
official
character
may
cause
it
to
be
believed
i
desire
to
state
that
it
is
incorrect
the
enemy
did
not
capture
any
organized
body
of
men
on
that
occasion
but
only
stragglers
and
such
as
were
left
asleep
on
the
road
exhausted
by
the
fatigue
and
exposure
of
one
of
the
most
inclement
nights
i
have
ever
known
at
this
season
of
the
year
it
rained
without
cessation
rendering
the
road
by
which
our
troops
marched
to
the
bridge
at
falling
waters
very
difficult
to
pass
and
causing
so
much
delay
that
the
last
of
the
troops
did
not
cross
the
river
at
the
bridge
until
on
the
while
the
column
was
thus
detained
on
the
road
a
number
of
men
worn
down
by
fatigue
lay
down
in
barns
and
by
the
roadside
and
though
officers
were
sent
back
to
arouse
them
as
the
troops
moved
on
the
darkness
and
rain
prevented
them
from
finding
all
and
many
were
in
this
way
left
behind
two
guns
were
left
on
the
road
the
horses
that
drew
them
became
exhausted
and
the
officers
went
forward
to
procure
others
when
they
returned
the
rear
of
the
column
had
passed
the
guns
so
far
that
it
was
deemed
unsafe
to
send
back
for
them
and
they
were
thus
lost
no
arms
cannon
or
prisoners
were
taken
by
the
enemy
in
battle
but
only
such
as
were
left
behind
under
the
circumstances
i
have
described
the
number
of
stragglers
thus
lost
i
am
unable
to
state
with
accuracy
but
it
is
greatly
exaggerated
in
the
dispatch
referred
to
i
am
with
great
respect
your
obedient
servant
lee
the
solicitude
here
exhibited
by
the
southern
commander
that
the
actual
facts
should
be
recorded
is
natural
and
displayed
spirit
of
soldiership
he
was
unwilling
that
his
old
army
should
appear
in
the
light
of
a
routed
column
retreating
in
disorder
with
loss
of
men
and
munitions
when
they
lost
neither
xxi
across
the
blue
ridge
again
lee
moved
his
army
to
the
old
encampment
on
the
banks
of
the
opequan
which
it
had
occupied
after
the
retreat
from
sharpsburg
in
september
and
here
a
few
days
were
spent
in
resting
we
have
in
the
journal
of
a
foreign
officer
an
outline
of
personal
appearance
at
this
time
and
as
we
are
not
diverted
from
these
characteristic
details
at
the
moment
by
the
narrative
of
great
events
this
account
of
lee
given
by
the
officer
in
question
colonel
freemantle
of
the
british
army
is
laid
before
the
reader
general
lee
is
almost
without
exception
the
handsomest
man
of
his
age
i
ever
saw
he
is
tall
very
well
made
well
set
up
a
thorough
soldier
in
appearance
and
his
manners
are
most
courteous
and
full
of
dignity
he
is
a
perfect
gentleman
in
every
respect
i
imagine
no
man
has
so
few
enemies
or
is
so
universally
esteemed
throughout
the
south
all
agree
in
pronouncing
him
as
near
perfection
as
man
can
be
he
has
none
of
the
small
vices
such
as
smoking
drinking
chewing
or
swearing
and
his
bitterest
enemy
never
accused
him
of
any
of
the
greater
ones
he
generally
wears
a
long
gray
jacket
a
high
hat
and
blue
trousers
tucked
into
his
wellington
boots
i
never
saw
him
carry
arms
and
the
only
marks
of
his
military
rank
are
the
three
stars
on
his
collar
he
rides
a
handsome
horse
which
is
extremely
well
governed
he
himself
is
very
neat
in
his
dress
and
person
and
in
the
most
arduous
marches
he
always
looks
smart
and
clean
it
is
understood
that
general
lee
is
a
religious
man
though
not
so
demonstrative
in
that
respect
as
jackson
and
unlike
his
late
he
is
a
member
of
the
church
of
england
his
only
faults
so
far
as
i
can
learn
arise
from
his
excessive
amiability
this
personal
description
is
entirely
correct
except
that
the
word
jacket
conveys
a
somewhat
erroneous
idea
of
lee
undress
uniform
coat
and
his
hat
was
generally
gray
otherwise
the
sketch
is
exactly
accurate
and
is
here
presented
as
the
unprejudiced
description
and
estimate
of
a
foreign
gentleman
who
had
no
inducement
such
as
might
be
attributed
to
a
southern
writer
to
overcolor
his
portrait
such
in
personal
appearance
was
the
leader
of
the
southern
army
a
plain
soldier
in
a
plain
dress
without
arms
with
slight
indications
of
rank
courteous
full
of
dignity
a
perfect
gentleman
and
with
no
fault
save
an
excessive
amiability
the
figure
is
attractive
to
the
eye
it
excited
the
admiration
of
a
foreign
officer
and
remains
in
many
memories
now
when
the
sound
of
battle
is
hushed
and
the
great
leader
in
turn
has
finished
his
and
lain
down
in
peace
the
movements
of
the
two
armies
were
soon
resumed
and
we
shall
briefly
follow
those
movements
which
led
the
adversaries
back
to
the
rappahannock
lee
appears
to
have
conceived
the
design
after
crossing
the
potomac
at
williamsport
to
pass
the
shenandoah
river
and
the
blue
ridge
and
thus
place
himself
in
the
path
of
general
meade
if
he
crossed
east
of
the
mountain
or
threaten
washington
this
appears
from
his
own
statement
owing
he
says
to
the
swollen
condition
of
shenandoah
river
the
plan
of
operations
which
had
been
contemplated
when
we
recrossed
the
potomac
could
not
be
put
in
the
points
fixed
upon
by
lee
for
passing
the
mountain
were
probably
snicker
and
ashby
gaps
opposite
berryville
and
millwood
the
rains
had
however
made
the
river
in
these
places
unfordable
on
the
and
days
of
july
less
than
a
week
after
lee
crossing
at
williamsport
general
meade
passed
the
potomac
above
leesburg
and
lee
moved
his
army
in
the
direction
of
chester
gap
near
front
royal
toward
culpepper
the
new
movements
were
almost
identically
the
same
as
the
old
when
general
mcclellan
advanced
in
november
and
the
adoption
of
the
same
plans
by
general
meade
involves
a
high
compliment
to
his
predecessor
he
acted
with
even
more
energy
as
lee
head
of
column
was
defiling
toward
chester
gap
beyond
front
royal
general
meade
struck
at
it
through
manassas
gap
directly
on
its
flank
and
an
action
followed
which
promised
at
one
time
to
become
serious
the
enemy
was
however
repulsed
and
the
southern
column
continued
its
way
across
the
mountain
the
rest
of
the
army
followed
and
descended
into
culpepper
from
which
position
when
longstreet
was
detached
to
the
west
lee
retired
taking
post
behind
the
rapidan
general
meade
thereupon
followed
and
occupied
culpepper
his
advance
being
about
between
culpepper
and
the
river
such
was
the
position
of
the
two
armies
in
the
first
days
of
october
when
lee
weary
it
seemed
of
inactivity
set
out
to
flank
and
fight
his
adversary
part
vii
campaigns
of
the
i
the
cavalry
of
lee
army
in
a
work
of
the
present
description
the
writer
has
a
choice
between
two
courses
he
may
either
record
the
events
of
the
war
in
all
quarters
of
the
country
as
bearing
more
or
less
upon
his
narrative
or
may
confine
himself
to
the
life
of
the
individual
who
is
the
immediate
subject
of
his
volume
of
these
two
courses
the
writer
prefers
the
latter
for
many
reasons
to
present
a
narrative
of
military
transactions
in
all
portions
of
the
south
would
expand
this
volume
to
undue
proportions
and
there
is
the
further
objection
that
these
occurrences
are
familiar
to
all
it
might
be
necessary
in
writing
for
persons
ignorant
of
the
events
of
the
great
conflict
to
omit
nothing
but
this
ignorance
does
not
probably
exist
in
the
case
of
the
readers
of
these
pages
and
the
writer
will
continue
as
heretofore
to
confine
himself
to
the
main
subject
only
noting
incidentally
such
prominent
events
in
other
quarters
as
affected
movements
one
such
event
was
the
fall
of
vicksburg
which
post
surrendered
at
the
same
moment
with
the
defeat
at
gettysburg
rendering
thereafter
impossible
all
movements
of
invasion
and
another
was
the
advance
of
general
rosecrans
toward
atlanta
which
resulted
in
the
month
of
september
in
a
southern
victory
at
chickamauga
the
immediate
effect
of
the
federal
demonstration
toward
chattanooga
had
been
to
detach
longstreet
corps
from
general
lee
army
for
service
under
general
bragg
general
meade
force
is
said
to
have
also
been
somewhat
lessened
by
detachments
sent
to
enforce
the
draft
in
new
york
and
these
circumstances
had
in
the
first
days
of
october
reduced
both
armies
in
virginia
to
a
less
force
than
they
had
numbered
in
the
past
campaign
general
meade
however
presented
a
bold
front
to
his
adversary
and
with
his
headquarters
near
culpepper
kept
close
watch
upon
lee
whose
army
lay
along
the
south
bank
of
the
rapidan
for
some
weeks
no
military
movements
took
place
and
an
occasional
cavalry
skirmish
between
the
troopers
of
the
two
armies
was
all
which
broke
the
monotony
of
the
autumn
days
this
inactivity
however
was
now
about
to
terminate
lee
had
resolved
to
attempt
a
flank
movement
around
general
meade
right
with
the
view
of
bringing
him
to
battle
and
a
brief
campaign
ensued
which
if
indecisive
and
reflecting
little
glory
upon
the
infantry
was
fruitful
in
romantic
incidents
and
highly
creditable
to
the
cavalry
of
the
southern
army
in
following
the
movements
and
describing
the
operations
of
the
main
body
of
the
army
the
infantry
we
have
necessarily
been
compelled
to
pass
over
to
a
great
extent
the
services
of
the
cavalry
in
the
past
campaign
these
had
nevertheless
been
great
no
arm
of
the
service
had
exhibited
greater
efficiency
and
but
for
the
fact
that
in
all
armies
the
brunt
of
battle
falls
upon
the
it
might
be
added
that
the
services
of
the
cavalry
had
been
as
important
as
those
of
the
infantry
stuart
was
now
in
command
of
a
force
varying
from
five
to
eight
thousand
sabres
and
among
his
troopers
were
some
of
the
best
of
the
south
the
cavalry
had
always
been
the
favorite
arm
with
the
southern
youth
it
had
drawn
to
itself
as
privates
in
the
ranks
thousands
of
young
men
of
collegiate
education
great
wealth
and
the
highest
social
position
and
this
force
was
officered
in
virginia
by
such
resolute
commanders
as
wade
hampton
fitz
lee
william
lee
rosser
jones
wickham
young
munford
and
many
others
under
these
leaders
and
assisted
by
the
stuart
under
pelham
and
his
successors
the
cavalry
had
borne
their
full
share
in
the
hard
marches
and
combats
of
the
army
on
the
chickahominy
in
the
march
to
manassas
and
the
battles
in
maryland
in
the
operations
on
the
rappahannock
and
the
incessant
fighting
of
the
campaign
to
gettysburg
stuart
and
his
troopers
had
vindicated
their
claim
to
the
first
honors
of
arms
and
if
these
services
were
not
duly
estimated
by
the
infantry
of
the
army
the
fact
was
mainly
attributable
to
the
circumstance
that
the
fighting
of
the
cavalry
had
been
done
at
a
distance
upon
the
outposts
far
more
than
in
the
pitched
battles
where
in
modern
times
from
the
improved
and
destructive
character
of
artillery
playing
havoc
with
horses
the
cavalry
arm
can
achieve
little
and
is
not
risked
the
actual
losses
in
stuart
command
left
however
no
doubt
of
the
obstinate
soldiership
of
officers
and
men
since
the
opening
of
the
year
he
had
lost
general
hampton
cut
down
in
a
at
gettysburg
general
lee
shot
in
the
fight
at
fleetwood
colonels
frank
hampton
and
williams
killed
in
the
same
action
colonel
butler
torn
by
a
shell
major
pelham
chief
of
artillery
killed
while
leading
a
charge
footnote
in
this
enumeration
the
writer
mentions
only
such
names
as
occur
at
the
moment
to
his
memory
a
careful
examination
of
the
records
of
the
cavalry
would
probably
furnish
the
names
of
ten
times
as
many
equally
brave
and
unfortunate
about
six
officers
of
his
personal
staff
either
killed
wounded
or
captured
and
in
the
gettysburg
campaign
he
had
lost
nearly
of
his
entire
command
of
its
value
to
the
army
the
infantry
might
have
their
doubts
but
general
lee
had
none
stuart
and
his
horsemen
had
been
the
eyes
and
ears
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
had
fought
incessantly
as
well
as
observed
the
enemy
and
lee
never
committed
the
injustice
of
undervaluing
this
indispensable
arm
which
if
his
official
commendation
of
its
operations
under
stuart
is
to
be
believed
was
only
second
in
importance
in
his
estimation
to
the
infantry
itself
the
army
continued
nevertheless
to
amuse
itself
at
the
expense
of
the
cavalry
and
either
asserted
or
intimated
on
every
favorable
occasion
that
the
was
done
by
themselves
this
flattering
assumption
might
be
natural
under
the
circumstances
but
it
was
now
about
to
be
shown
to
be
wholly
unfounded
a
campaign
was
at
hand
in
which
the
cavalry
were
to
turn
the
tables
upon
their
jocose
critics
and
silence
them
where
the
infantry
were
doomed
to
failure
in
nearly
all
which
they
attempted
and
the
troopers
were
to
do
the
greater
part
of
the
fighting
and
achieve
the
only
successes
to
the
narrative
of
this
brief
and
romantic
episode
of
the
war
we
now
proceed
general
lee
aim
was
to
pass
around
the
right
flank
of
his
adversary
and
bring
him
to
battle
and
although
the
promptness
of
general
meade
movements
defeated
the
object
nearly
completely
the
manoeuvres
of
the
two
armies
form
a
study
the
eminent
soldiers
commanding
the
forces
played
a
veritable
game
of
chess
with
each
other
there
was
little
hard
fighting
but
more
scientific
manoeuvring
than
is
generally
displayed
in
a
campaign
the
brains
of
lee
and
meade
rather
than
the
two
armies
were
matched
against
each
other
and
the
conflict
of
ideas
proved
more
interesting
than
the
actual
fighting
ii
lee
flanks
general
meade
in
prosecution
of
the
plan
determined
upon
general
lee
on
the
morning
of
the
of
october
crossed
the
rapidan
at
the
fords
above
orange
with
the
corps
of
ewell
and
hill
and
directed
his
march
toward
madison
stuart
moved
with
hampton
cavalry
division
on
the
right
of
the
advancing
column
general
fitz
lee
having
been
left
with
his
division
to
guard
the
front
on
the
rapidan
and
general
imboden
commanding
west
of
the
blue
ridge
was
ordered
by
lee
to
advance
down
the
valley
and
guard
the
gaps
of
the
mountains
on
our
left
we
have
said
that
lee
design
was
to
bring
general
meade
to
battle
it
is
proper
to
state
this
distinctly
as
some
writers
have
attributed
to
him
in
the
campaign
as
his
real
object
the
design
of
manoeuvring
his
adversary
out
of
culpepper
and
pushing
him
back
to
the
federal
frontier
his
own
words
are
perfectly
plain
he
set
out
with
the
design
he
declares
of
on
an
engagement
with
the
federal
that
is
to
say
of
general
meade
not
simply
forcing
him
to
fall
back
his
opponent
it
seems
was
not
averse
to
accepting
battle
indeed
from
expressions
attributed
to
him
he
appears
to
have
ardently
desired
it
in
case
he
could
secure
an
advantageous
position
for
receiving
the
southern
attack
it
is
desirable
that
this
readiness
in
both
commanders
to
fight
should
be
kept
in
view
the
fact
adds
largely
to
the
interest
of
this
brief
campaign
of
manoeuvres
in
which
the
army
falling
back
like
that
advancing
sought
battle
to
proceed
to
the
narrative
which
will
deal
in
large
measure
with
the
operations
of
the
cavalry
that
arm
of
the
service
as
we
have
said
having
borne
the
chief
share
of
the
fighting
and
achieved
the
only
successes
stuart
moved
out
on
the
right
of
the
infantry
which
marched
directly
toward
madison
and
near
the
village
of
james
city
directly
west
of
culpepper
drove
in
the
cavalry
and
infantry
outposts
of
general
kilpatrick
on
the
main
body
beyond
the
village
continuous
skirmishing
ensued
throughout
the
rest
of
the
day
stuart
object
being
to
occupy
the
enemy
and
divert
attention
from
the
infantry
movement
in
his
rear
in
this
he
seems
to
have
fully
succeeded
lee
passed
madison
and
moving
as
he
says
by
circuitous
and
concealed
roads
reached
the
vicinity
of
griffinsburg
on
what
is
called
the
sperryville
road
northwest
of
culpepper
a
glance
at
the
map
will
show
the
relative
positions
of
the
two
armies
at
this
moment
general
meade
lay
around
culpepper
with
his
advance
about
between
that
place
and
the
rapidan
and
lee
had
attained
a
position
which
gave
him
fair
hopes
of
intercepting
his
adversary
retreat
that
retreat
must
be
over
the
line
of
the
orange
and
alexandria
railroad
but
from
griffinsburg
to
manassas
was
no
farther
than
from
culpepper
to
the
same
point
if
the
federal
army
fell
back
as
lee
anticipated
it
would
be
a
question
of
speed
between
the
retreating
and
pursuing
columns
and
as
the
narrative
will
show
the
race
was
close
a
few
hours
lost
making
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
in
lee
movement
on
the
morning
of
the
while
the
infantry
were
still
near
griffinsburg
general
stuart
moved
promptly
down
upon
culpepper
driving
the
enemy
from
their
large
camps
near
stonehouse
mountain
these
were
elaborately
provided
with
luxuries
of
every
description
and
there
were
many
indications
of
the
fact
that
the
troops
had
expected
to
winter
there
no
serious
fighting
occurred
a
regiment
of
infantry
was
charged
and
dispersed
by
the
jefferson
company
of
captain
baylor
and
stuart
then
proceeded
rapidly
to
culpepper
where
the
federal
cavalry
forming
the
of
the
army
awaited
him
general
meade
was
already
moving
in
the
direction
of
the
rappahannock
the
presence
of
the
southern
army
near
griffinsburg
had
become
known
to
him
he
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
lee
object
and
leaving
his
cavalry
to
cover
his
rear
he
moved
toward
the
river
as
stuart
attacked
the
federal
horse
posted
on
the
hills
east
of
the
village
the
roar
of
cannon
on
his
right
steadily
drawing
nearer
indicated
that
general
fitz
lee
was
forcing
the
enemy
in
that
direction
to
fall
back
stuart
was
now
in
high
spirits
and
indulged
in
hearty
laughter
although
the
enemy
shells
were
bursting
around
him
ride
back
to
general
lee
he
said
to
an
officer
of
his
staff
and
tell
him
we
are
forcing
the
enemy
back
on
the
rappahannock
and
i
think
i
hear
fitz
lee
guns
toward
the
rapidan
the
officer
obeyed
and
found
general
lee
at
his
headquarters
which
consisted
of
one
or
two
tents
with
a
set
up
in
front
on
the
highway
near
griffinsburg
he
was
conversing
with
general
ewell
and
the
contrast
between
the
two
soldiers
was
striking
ewell
was
thin
cadaverous
and
supported
himself
upon
a
crutch
for
he
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
wound
received
at
manassas
general
lee
on
the
contrary
was
erect
ruddy
robust
and
exhibited
indications
of
health
and
vigor
in
every
detail
of
his
person
when
stuart
message
was
delivered
to
him
he
bowed
with
that
grave
courtesy
which
he
exhibited
alike
toward
the
highest
and
the
lowest
soldier
in
his
army
and
said
thank
you
tell
general
stuart
to
continue
to
press
them
back
toward
the
river
he
then
smiled
and
added
with
that
accent
of
sedate
humor
which
at
times
characterized
him
but
tell
him
too
to
spare
his
horses
to
spare
his
horses
it
is
not
necessary
to
send
so
many
messages
he
turned
as
he
spoke
to
general
ewell
and
pointing
to
the
officer
who
had
come
from
stuart
and
another
who
had
arrived
just
before
him
said
with
lurking
humor
i
think
these
two
young
gentlemen
make
messengers
sent
me
by
general
stuart
he
then
said
to
ewell
you
may
as
well
move
on
with
your
troops
i
suppose
general
and
soon
afterward
the
infantry
began
to
advance
stuart
was
meanwhile
engaged
in
an
obstinate
combat
with
the
federal
cavalry
near
brandy
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
fleetwood
hill
the
scene
of
the
great
fight
in
june
the
stand
made
by
the
enemy
was
resolute
but
the
arrival
of
general
fitz
lee
decided
the
event
that
officer
had
crossed
the
rapidan
and
driven
general
buford
before
him
the
result
now
was
that
while
stuart
was
pressing
the
enemy
in
his
front
general
buford
came
down
on
stuart
rear
and
fitz
lee
on
the
rear
of
buford
the
scene
which
ensued
was
a
grand
commingling
of
the
tragic
and
every
thing
was
mingled
in
wild
confusion
but
the
day
remained
with
the
southern
cavalry
who
at
nightfall
had
pressed
their
opponents
back
toward
the
river
which
the
federal
army
crossed
that
night
blowing
up
the
railroad
bridge
behind
them
such
was
the
first
act
of
the
bustling
drama
at
the
approach
of
lee
general
meade
had
vanished
from
culpepper
and
so
well
arranged
was
the
whole
movement
in
spite
of
its
rapidity
that
scarce
an
empty
box
was
left
behind
lee
aim
to
bring
his
adversary
to
battle
south
of
the
rappahannock
had
thus
failed
but
the
attempt
was
renewed
by
a
continuation
of
the
flanking
movement
toward
warrenton
springs
with
the
design
lee
says
of
reaching
the
orange
and
alexandria
railroad
north
of
the
river
and
interrupting
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
unfortunately
however
for
this
project
which
required
of
all
things
rapidity
of
movement
it
was
found
necessary
to
remain
nearly
all
day
on
the
near
culpepper
to
supply
the
army
with
provisions
it
was
not
until
the
that
the
army
again
moved
stuart
preceded
it
and
after
a
brisk
skirmish
drove
the
enemy
from
warrenton
springs
advancing
in
person
in
front
of
his
column
as
it
charged
through
the
river
and
up
the
hill
beyond
where
a
considerable
body
of
federal
marksmen
were
put
to
flight
the
cavalry
then
pressed
on
toward
warrenton
and
the
infantry
who
had
witnessed
their
prowess
and
cheered
them
heartily
followed
on
the
same
road
the
race
between
lee
and
general
meade
was
in
full
progress
it
was
destined
to
become
complicated
and
an
error
committed
by
general
meade
came
very
near
exposing
him
to
serious
danger
it
appears
that
after
retreating
across
the
rappahannock
the
federal
commander
began
to
entertain
doubt
whether
the
movement
had
not
been
hasty
and
would
not
justly
subject
him
to
the
charge
of
yielding
to
sudden
panic
influenced
apparently
by
this
sentiment
he
now
ordered
three
corps
of
the
federal
army
with
a
division
of
cavalry
back
to
culpepper
and
this
the
main
body
accordingly
crossed
back
leaving
but
one
corps
north
of
the
river
such
was
now
the
very
peculiar
situation
of
the
two
armies
general
lee
was
moving
steadily
in
the
direction
of
warrenton
to
cut
off
his
adversary
from
manassas
and
that
adversary
was
moving
back
into
culpepper
to
hunt
up
lee
there
the
comedy
of
errors
was
soon
terminated
but
not
so
soon
as
it
otherwise
would
have
been
but
for
a
de
played
by
generals
rosser
and
young
general
rosser
had
been
left
by
stuart
near
brandy
with
about
two
hundred
horsemen
and
one
gun
and
when
the
three
infantry
corps
and
the
cavalry
division
of
general
meade
moved
forward
from
the
river
they
encountered
this
obstacle
insignificant
as
was
his
force
general
rosser
so
manoeuvred
it
as
to
produce
the
impression
that
it
was
considerable
and
though
forced
of
course
to
fall
back
he
did
so
fighting
at
every
step
assistance
reached
him
just
at
dusk
in
the
shape
of
a
brigade
of
cavalry
from
above
the
under
general
young
the
same
officer
whose
charge
at
the
fleetwood
fight
had
had
so
important
a
bearing
upon
the
result
there
young
now
formed
line
with
his
men
dismounted
and
advancing
with
a
confident
air
opened
fire
upon
the
federal
army
the
darkness
proved
friendly
and
taking
advantage
of
it
general
young
kindled
fires
along
a
front
of
more
than
a
mile
ordered
his
band
to
play
and
must
have
caused
the
enemy
to
doubt
whether
lee
was
not
still
in
large
force
near
culpepper
they
accordingly
went
into
camp
to
await
the
return
of
daylight
when
at
midnight
a
courier
came
with
orders
from
general
meade
these
orders
were
urgent
and
directed
the
federal
troops
to
recross
the
river
with
all
haste
general
lee
it
was
now
ascertained
had
left
an
insignificant
force
in
culpepper
and
with
nearly
his
whole
army
was
moving
rapidly
toward
warrenton
to
cut
off
his
adversary
iii
a
race
between
two
armies
the
game
of
to
change
the
figure
was
now
in
full
progress
and
nothing
more
dramatic
could
be
conceived
of
than
the
relative
positions
of
the
two
armies
at
midnight
on
monday
october
lee
army
was
near
warrenton
springs
ready
to
advance
in
the
morning
upon
warrenton
while
three
of
the
four
corps
under
general
meade
were
between
the
rappahannock
and
culpepper
expecting
battle
there
thus
a
choice
of
two
courses
was
presented
to
the
federal
commander
to
order
back
his
main
force
and
rapidly
retreat
toward
manassas
or
move
the
fourth
corps
to
support
it
and
place
his
whole
army
directly
in
rear
the
occasion
demanded
instant
decision
every
hour
now
counted
but
unfortunately
for
general
meade
he
was
still
in
the
dark
as
to
the
actual
amount
of
lee
force
in
culpepper
the
movement
toward
warrenton
might
be
a
mere
the
great
master
of
the
art
of
war
to
whom
he
was
opposed
might
have
laid
this
trap
for
him
have
counted
upon
his
falling
into
the
snare
and
while
a
portion
of
the
southern
force
was
engaged
in
culpepper
might
design
an
attack
with
the
rest
upon
the
federal
right
flank
or
rear
in
fact
the
situation
of
affairs
was
so
anomalous
and
puzzling
that
lee
might
design
almost
any
thing
and
succeed
in
crushing
his
adversary
the
real
state
of
the
case
was
that
lee
designed
nothing
of
this
description
having
had
no
intimation
whatever
of
general
meade
new
movement
back
toward
culpepper
he
was
advancing
toward
warrenton
under
the
impression
that
his
adversary
was
retreating
and
aimed
to
come
up
with
him
somewhere
near
that
place
and
bring
him
to
battle
upon
this
theory
his
opponent
now
acted
by
promptly
ordering
back
his
three
corps
to
the
north
bank
of
the
rappahannock
they
began
to
march
soon
after
midnight
recrossed
the
river
near
the
railroad
and
on
the
morning
of
the
hastened
forward
by
rapid
marches
to
pass
the
dangerous
point
near
warrenton
toward
which
lee
was
also
moving
with
his
infantry
in
this
race
every
advantage
seemed
to
be
on
the
side
of
lee
the
three
federal
corps
had
fully
twice
as
far
to
march
as
the
southern
forces
lee
was
concentrating
near
warrenton
while
they
were
far
in
the
rear
and
if
the
confederates
moved
with
only
half
the
rapidity
of
their
adversaries
they
were
certain
to
intercept
them
and
compel
them
either
to
surrender
or
cut
their
way
through
these
comments
tedious
perhaps
are
necessary
to
the
comprehension
of
the
singular
situation
we
proceed
now
with
the
narrative
stuart
had
pushed
on
past
warrenton
with
his
cavalry
toward
the
orange
railroad
when
on
the
night
of
the
he
met
with
one
of
those
adventures
which
were
thickly
strewed
throughout
his
romantic
career
he
was
near
auburn
just
at
nightfall
when
as
his
closed
up
information
reached
him
from
that
quarter
that
the
federal
army
was
passing
directly
in
his
rear
nearly
at
the
same
moment
intelligence
arrived
that
another
column
of
the
enemy
consisting
like
the
first
of
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
was
moving
across
his
front
stuart
was
now
in
an
actual
trap
and
his
situation
was
perilous
in
the
extreme
he
was
enclosed
between
two
moving
walls
of
enemies
and
if
discovered
his
fate
seemed
sealed
but
one
course
was
left
him
to
preserve
if
possible
complete
silence
in
his
command
to
lie
in
the
wood
and
await
the
occurrence
of
some
fortunate
event
to
extricate
him
from
his
situation
he
accordingly
issued
stringent
orders
to
the
men
that
no
noise
of
any
description
should
be
made
and
not
a
word
be
uttered
and
there
was
little
necessity
to
repeat
this
command
the
troopers
remained
silent
and
motionless
in
the
saddle
throughout
the
night
ready
at
any
instant
to
move
at
the
order
and
thus
passed
the
long
hours
of
darkness
the
southern
horsemen
as
silent
as
phantoms
the
federal
columns
passing
rapidly
with
the
roll
of
the
tramp
of
and
the
shuffling
sound
of
feet
on
both
sides
of
the
command
the
column
moving
in
rear
of
stuart
being
distant
but
two
or
three
hundred
yards
this
romantic
incident
was
destined
to
terminate
fortunately
for
stuart
who
having
dispatched
scouts
to
steal
through
the
federal
column
and
announce
his
situation
to
general
lee
prepared
to
seize
upon
the
first
opportunity
to
release
his
command
from
its
imminent
peril
the
opportunity
came
at
dawn
the
federal
rear
under
general
caldwell
had
bivouacked
near
and
had
just
kindled
fires
to
cook
their
breakfast
when
from
the
valley
beneath
the
hill
on
which
the
troops
had
halted
stuart
opened
suddenly
upon
them
with
his
and
as
he
says
in
his
report
knocked
over
and
other
utensils
at
the
moment
when
the
men
least
expected
it
he
then
advanced
his
and
directed
a
rapid
fire
upon
the
disordered
troops
and
under
cover
of
this
fire
wheeled
to
the
left
and
emerged
safely
toward
warrenton
the
army
greeted
him
with
cheers
and
he
was
himself
in
the
highest
spirits
he
had
certainly
good
reason
for
this
joy
for
he
had
just
grazed
destruction
as
stuart
artillery
opened
the
sound
was
taken
up
toward
warrenton
where
ewell
in
obedience
to
lee
orders
had
attacked
the
federal
column
nothing
resulted
however
from
this
assault
general
meade
had
concentrated
his
army
and
was
hastening
toward
manassas
all
now
depended
again
upon
the
celerity
of
lee
movements
in
pursuit
he
had
lost
many
hours
at
warrenton
where
another
halt
was
made
he
says
to
supply
the
troops
with
provisions
thus
on
the
morning
of
the
he
was
as
far
from
intercepting
general
meade
as
before
and
all
now
depended
upon
the
movements
of
hill
who
while
ewell
moved
toward
greenwich
had
been
sent
by
way
of
new
baltimore
to
come
in
on
the
federal
line
of
retreat
at
bristoe
station
near
manassas
in
spite
however
of
his
excellent
soldiership
and
habitual
promptness
hill
did
not
arrive
in
time
he
made
the
détour
prescribed
by
lee
passed
new
baltimore
and
hastened
on
toward
bristoe
where
on
approaching
that
point
he
found
only
the
of
the
federal
army
the
whole
force
with
this
exception
having
crossed
broad
run
and
hastened
on
toward
manassas
hill
arrival
had
thus
been
tardy
it
would
have
been
fortunate
for
him
if
he
had
not
arrived
at
all
seeing
the
federal
column
under
general
warren
hastening
along
the
railroad
to
pass
broad
run
he
ordered
a
prompt
attack
and
cooke
brigade
led
the
charge
the
result
was
unfortunate
for
the
confederates
general
warren
seeing
his
peril
had
promptly
disposed
his
line
behind
the
railroad
embankment
at
the
spot
where
protected
by
this
impromptu
breastwork
the
men
rested
their
guns
upon
the
iron
rails
and
poured
a
destructive
fire
upon
the
southerners
rushing
down
the
open
slope
in
front
by
this
fire
general
cooke
was
severely
wounded
and
fell
and
his
brigade
lost
a
considerable
part
of
its
numbers
before
a
new
attack
could
be
made
general
warren
hastily
withdrew
carrying
off
with
him
in
triumph
a
number
of
prisoners
and
five
pieces
of
artillery
captured
on
the
banks
of
the
run
before
his
retreat
could
be
again
interrupted
he
was
safe
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
and
lost
no
time
in
hurrying
forward
to
join
the
main
body
which
was
retreating
on
centreville
general
meade
had
thus
completely
foiled
his
adversary
lee
had
set
out
with
the
intention
of
bringing
the
federal
commander
to
battle
had
not
succeeded
in
doing
so
owing
to
the
rapidity
of
his
retreat
had
come
up
only
with
his
under
circumstances
which
seemed
to
seal
the
fate
of
that
detached
force
and
the
small
had
repulsed
him
completely
capturing
prisoners
and
artillery
from
him
and
retiring
in
triumph
such
had
been
the
issue
of
the
campaign
all
the
success
had
been
on
the
side
of
general
meade
he
is
said
to
have
declared
that
it
was
like
pulling
out
his
not
to
have
had
a
fight
but
something
resembling
fighting
had
occurred
on
the
banks
of
broad
run
and
the
victory
was
clearly
on
the
side
of
the
federal
troops
to
turn
to
general
lee
it
would
be
an
interesting
question
to
discuss
whether
he
really
desired
to
general
meade
if
there
were
any
data
upon
which
to
base
a
decision
the
writer
hazards
the
observation
that
it
seems
doubtful
whether
this
was
lee
intention
he
had
a
high
opinion
of
general
meade
and
is
said
to
have
declared
of
that
commander
that
he
gave
him
lee
as
much
trouble
as
any
of
them
lee
was
thus
opposed
to
a
soldier
whose
ability
he
respected
and
it
appears
doubtful
whether
he
desired
to
move
so
rapidly
as
to
expose
his
own
communications
to
interruption
by
his
adversary
this
view
seems
to
derive
support
from
the
apparently
unnecessary
delays
at
culpepper
and
warrenton
there
was
certainly
no
good
reason
why
under
ordinary
circumstances
an
army
so
accustomed
to
rapid
marches
as
the
army
of
northern
virginia
should
not
have
been
able
to
reach
warrenton
from
the
neighborhood
of
culpepper
in
less
than
we
were
to
halt
lee
writes
of
the
delay
at
culpepper
but
of
that
at
warrenton
he
simply
says
another
halt
was
made
whether
these
views
have
or
have
not
foundation
the
reader
must
judge
we
shall
aim
in
a
few
pages
to
conclude
our
account
of
this
interesting
campaign
iv
the
fight
at
buckland
lee
rode
forward
to
the
field
upon
which
general
hill
had
sustained
his
bloody
repulse
and
hill
depressed
and
mortified
at
the
mishap
endeavored
to
explain
the
and
vindicate
himself
from
censure
lee
is
said
to
have
listened
in
silence
as
they
rode
among
the
dead
bodies
and
to
have
at
length
replied
gravely
and
sadly
well
well
general
bury
these
poor
men
and
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
he
had
issued
orders
that
the
troops
should
cease
the
pursuit
and
riding
on
the
next
morning
with
general
stuart
to
the
summit
of
a
hill
overlooking
broad
run
dismounted
and
held
a
brief
conversation
with
the
commander
of
his
cavalry
looking
intently
as
he
spoke
in
the
direction
of
manassas
his
demeanor
was
that
of
a
person
who
is
far
from
pleased
with
the
course
of
events
and
the
word
best
describes
his
expression
the
safe
retreat
of
general
meade
with
the
heavy
blow
struck
by
him
in
retiring
was
indeed
enough
to
account
for
this
the
campaign
was
altogether
a
failure
since
general
meade
position
at
centreville
was
unassailable
and
if
he
were
only
driven
therefrom
he
had
but
to
retire
to
the
defences
at
washington
lee
accordingly
gave
stuart
directions
to
follow
up
the
enemy
in
the
direction
of
centreville
and
ordering
the
orange
and
alexandria
railroad
to
be
torn
up
back
to
the
rappahannock
put
his
infantry
in
motion
and
marched
back
toward
culpepper
we
shall
now
briefly
follow
the
movements
of
the
cavalry
stuart
advanced
to
manassas
following
up
the
federal
rear
and
hastening
their
retreat
across
bull
run
beyond
he
then
left
fitz
lee
division
near
manassas
in
the
federal
front
and
moving
with
division
to
the
left
toward
groveton
passed
the
little
catharpin
proceeded
thence
through
the
beautiful
autumn
forest
toward
frying
pan
and
there
found
and
attacked
with
his
command
dismounted
and
acting
as
the
second
corps
of
the
federal
army
this
sudden
appearance
of
southern
troops
on
the
flank
of
centreville
is
said
to
have
caused
great
excitement
there
as
it
was
not
known
that
the
force
was
not
general
lee
army
the
fact
was
soon
apparent
however
that
it
was
merely
a
cavalry
attack
the
federal
infantry
advanced
whereupon
stuart
retired
and
the
adventurous
southern
horsemen
moved
back
in
the
direction
of
warrenton
they
were
not
to
rejoin
lee
army
however
before
a
final
conflict
with
the
federal
cavalry
and
the
circumstances
of
this
conflict
were
as
dramatic
and
picturesque
as
the
de
of
young
in
culpepper
and
the
midnight
adventure
of
stuart
near
auburn
the
bold
assault
on
the
second
corps
seemed
to
have
excited
the
ire
of
the
federal
commander
and
he
promptly
sent
forward
a
considerable
body
of
his
cavalry
under
general
kilpatrick
to
pursue
stuart
and
if
possible
come
up
with
and
defeat
him
stuart
was
near
the
village
of
buckland
on
the
road
to
warrenton
when
intelligence
of
the
approach
of
the
federal
cavalry
reached
him
the
movement
which
followed
was
suggested
by
general
fitz
lee
he
proposed
that
stuart
should
retire
toward
warrenton
with
division
while
he
with
his
own
division
remained
on
the
left
flank
then
at
a
given
signal
stuart
was
to
face
about
he
general
fitz
lee
would
attack
them
in
flank
when
their
rout
would
probably
ensue
this
plan
was
carried
out
to
the
letter
general
kilpatrick
who
seems
to
have
been
confident
of
his
ability
to
drive
stuart
before
him
pressed
forward
on
the
warrenton
road
closely
following
up
his
adversary
when
the
sudden
boom
of
artillery
from
general
fitz
lee
gave
the
signal
stuart
wheeled
at
the
signal
and
made
a
headlong
charge
upon
his
pursuers
fitz
lee
came
in
at
the
same
moment
and
attacked
them
in
flank
and
the
result
was
that
general
kilpatrick
entire
command
was
routed
and
retreated
in
confusion
stuart
pursuing
as
he
wrote
from
within
three
miles
of
warrenton
to
buckland
the
horses
at
full
speed
the
whole
distance
so
terminated
an
incident
afterward
known
among
the
troopers
of
stuart
by
the
jocose
title
of
the
buckland
races
and
the
southern
cavalry
retired
without
further
molestation
behind
the
rappahannock
the
coöperation
of
general
imboden
in
the
campaign
should
not
be
passed
over
that
officer
whose
special
duty
had
been
to
guard
the
gaps
in
the
blue
ridge
advanced
from
berryville
to
charlestown
attacked
the
federal
garrison
at
the
latter
place
drove
them
in
disorder
toward
harper
ferry
and
carried
back
with
him
four
or
five
hundred
prisoners
the
enemy
followed
him
closely
and
he
was
forced
to
fight
them
off
at
every
step
he
succeeded
however
in
returning
in
safety
having
performed
more
than
the
duty
expected
of
him
lee
was
now
behind
the
rappahannock
and
it
remained
to
be
seen
what
course
general
meade
would
pursue
whether
he
would
remain
near
centreville
or
strive
to
regain
his
lost
ground
all
doubt
was
soon
terminated
by
the
approach
of
the
federal
army
which
marching
from
centreville
on
october
and
repairing
the
railroad
as
it
advanced
reached
the
rappahannock
on
the
of
november
lee
army
at
this
time
was
in
camp
toward
culpepper
with
advanced
forces
in
front
of
kelly
ford
and
the
railroad
bridge
general
meade
acted
with
vigor
on
his
arrival
he
promptly
sent
a
force
across
at
kelly
ford
the
southern
troops
occupying
the
there
were
driven
off
with
the
loss
of
many
prisoners
and
an
attack
near
the
railroad
bridge
had
still
more
unfortunate
results
for
general
lee
a
portion
of
early
division
had
been
posted
in
the
abandoned
federal
works
on
the
north
bank
at
this
point
and
these
were
now
attacked
and
after
a
fierce
resistance
completely
routed
nearly
the
whole
command
was
captured
the
remnant
barely
escaping
and
the
way
having
thus
been
cleared
general
meade
threw
his
army
across
into
culpepper
general
lee
retired
before
him
with
a
heavy
heart
and
a
deep
melancholy
which
in
spite
of
his
great
control
over
himself
was
visible
in
his
countenance
the
of
the
campaign
had
begun
and
ended
in
disaster
for
him
in
the
thirty
days
he
had
lost
at
least
two
thousand
men
and
was
back
again
in
his
old
camps
having
achieved
absolutely
nothing
the
advance
to
mine
run
november
of
the
bloody
year
had
come
and
it
seemed
not
unreasonable
to
anticipate
that
a
twelvemonth
marked
by
such
incessant
fighting
at
chancellorsville
fredericksburg
salem
church
winchester
gettysburg
front
royal
bristoe
and
along
the
rappahannock
would
now
terminate
in
peace
permitting
the
combatants
on
both
sides
worn
out
by
their
arduous
work
to
go
into
and
recuperate
their
energies
for
the
operations
of
the
ensuing
spring
but
general
meade
had
otherwise
determined
he
had
resolved
to
try
a
last
advance
in
spite
of
the
inclement
weather
and
anticipations
of
a
season
of
rest
and
refreshment
for
his
troops
undisturbed
by
hostile
demonstrations
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
were
destined
speedily
to
be
disappointed
the
southern
army
had
gone
regularly
into
south
of
the
rapidan
and
the
men
were
felicitating
themselves
upon
the
prospect
of
an
uninterrupted
season
of
leisure
and
enjoyment
in
their
rude
cabins
built
in
sheltered
nooks
or
under
their
breadths
of
canvas
raised
upon
logs
and
fitted
with
rough
but
comfortable
chimneys
built
of
notched
when
suddenly
intelligence
was
brought
by
scouts
that
the
federal
army
was
in
motion
the
fact
reversed
all
their
hopes
of
rest
and
song
and
laughter
by
the
good
the
musket
was
taken
from
its
place
on
the
rude
walls
the
assumed
and
the
army
was
once
more
ready
for
battle
as
gay
hopeful
and
resolved
as
in
the
first
days
of
spring
general
meade
had
indeed
resolved
that
the
year
should
not
end
without
another
blow
at
his
adversary
and
the
brief
campaign
known
as
the
advance
to
mine
run
followed
it
was
the
least
favorable
of
all
seasons
for
active
operations
but
the
federal
commander
is
vindicated
from
the
charge
of
bad
soldiership
by
two
circumstances
which
very
properly
had
great
weight
with
him
the
first
was
the
extreme
impatience
of
the
northern
authorities
and
people
at
the
small
results
of
the
bloody
fighting
of
the
year
gettysburg
had
seemed
to
them
a
complete
defeat
of
lee
since
he
had
retreated
thereafter
without
loss
of
time
to
virginia
and
yet
three
months
afterward
the
defeated
commander
had
advanced
upon
and
forced
back
his
victorious
adversary
that
such
should
be
the
result
of
the
year
campaigning
seemed
absurd
to
the
north
a
clamorous
appeal
was
made
to
the
authorities
to
order
another
advance
and
this
general
sentiment
is
said
to
have
been
shared
by
general
meade
who
had
declared
himself
bitterly
disappointed
at
missing
a
battle
with
lee
in
october
a
stronger
argument
in
favor
of
active
operations
lay
in
the
situation
at
the
moment
of
the
southern
army
lee
anticipating
no
further
fighting
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
opposed
the
enemy
on
the
rapidan
with
only
one
of
his
two
corps
that
of
ewell
while
the
other
that
of
hill
was
thrown
back
in
detached
divisions
at
various
points
on
the
orange
and
the
virginia
central
railroads
for
the
purpose
of
subsistence
during
the
winter
this
fact
becoming
known
to
general
meade
dictated
it
is
said
his
plan
of
operations
an
advance
seemed
to
promise
from
the
position
of
the
southern
forces
a
decisive
success
ewell
right
extended
no
farther
than
morton
ford
on
the
rapidan
and
thus
the
various
fords
down
to
chancellorsville
were
open
if
general
meade
could
cross
suddenly
and
by
a
rapid
march
interpose
between
ewell
and
the
scattered
divisions
of
hill
far
in
rear
it
appeared
not
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
lee
army
would
be
completely
disrupted
and
that
the
two
corps
one
after
another
might
be
crushed
by
the
federal
army
this
plan
which
is
given
on
the
authority
of
northern
writers
exhibited
good
soldiership
and
if
lee
were
to
be
caught
unawares
promised
to
succeed
without
further
comment
we
shall
now
proceed
to
the
narrative
of
this
brief
movement
which
indecisive
as
it
was
in
its
results
was
not
uninteresting
and
may
prove
as
attractive
to
the
military
student
as
other
operations
more
imposing
and
accompanied
by
bloodier
fighting
general
meade
began
to
move
toward
the
rapidan
on
november
and
every
exertion
was
made
by
him
to
advance
with
such
secrecy
and
rapidity
as
to
give
him
the
advantage
of
a
surprise
in
this
however
he
was
disappointed
no
sooner
had
his
orders
been
issued
and
the
correspondent
movements
begun
than
the
accomplished
scouts
of
stuart
hurried
across
the
rapidan
with
the
intelligence
stuart
whose
headquarters
were
in
a
hollow
of
the
hills
near
orange
and
not
far
from
general
lee
promptly
communicated
in
person
to
the
this
important
information
and
lee
dispatched
immediately
an
order
to
general
hill
in
rear
to
march
at
once
and
form
a
junction
with
ewell
in
the
vicinity
of
verdierville
the
latter
officer
was
directed
to
retire
from
his
advanced
position
upon
the
rapidan
which
exposed
him
to
an
attack
on
his
right
flank
and
rear
and
to
fall
back
and
take
post
behind
the
small
stream
called
mine
run
in
following
with
a
critical
eye
the
operations
of
general
lee
the
military
student
must
be
struck
particularly
by
one
circumstance
that
in
all
his
movements
he
seemed
to
proceed
less
according
to
the
nice
technicalities
of
the
art
of
war
than
in
accordance
with
the
dictates
of
a
broad
and
comprehensive
good
sense
it
may
be
said
that
in
choosing
position
he
always
chose
the
right
and
never
the
wrong
one
and
the
choice
of
mine
run
now
as
a
defensive
line
was
a
proof
of
this
the
run
is
a
small
which
rising
south
of
the
great
highway
between
orange
and
chancellorsville
flows
due
northward
amid
woods
and
between
hills
to
the
rapidan
into
which
it
empties
itself
a
few
miles
above
germanna
general
meade
main
place
of
crossing
this
stream
is
the
natural
defence
of
the
right
flank
of
an
army
posted
between
orange
and
the
rapidan
it
is
also
the
natural
and
obvious
line
upon
which
to
receive
the
attack
of
a
force
marching
from
below
toward
gordonsville
behind
mine
run
therefore
just
east
of
the
little
village
of
verdierville
general
lee
directed
his
two
corps
to
concentrate
and
at
the
word
the
men
lounging
but
now
carelessly
in
sprung
to
arms
fell
in
and
with
burnished
muskets
took
up
the
line
of
march
we
have
spoken
of
the
promptness
with
which
the
movement
was
made
and
it
may
almost
be
said
that
general
meade
had
scarcely
broken
up
his
camps
north
of
the
rapidan
when
lee
was
in
motion
to
go
and
meet
him
on
the
night
of
the
stuart
whose
cavalry
was
posted
opposite
the
lower
fords
pushed
forward
in
person
and
bivouacked
under
some
pines
just
below
verdierville
and
before
daylight
general
lee
was
also
in
the
saddle
and
at
sunrise
had
reached
the
same
point
the
night
had
been
severely
cold
for
winter
had
set
in
in
earnest
but
general
lee
always
robust
and
careless
of
weather
walked
down
without
wrapping
and
wearing
only
his
plain
gray
uniform
to
headquarters
under
the
pines
where
beside
a
great
fire
and
without
other
covering
than
his
the
commander
of
the
cavalry
had
slept
since
midnight
as
lee
approached
stuart
came
forward
and
lee
said
admiringly
what
a
hardy
soldier
they
consulted
stuart
walking
back
with
general
lee
and
receiving
his
orders
he
then
promptly
mounted
and
hastened
to
the
front
where
taking
command
of
his
cavalry
he
formed
it
in
front
of
the
advancing
enemy
and
with
artillery
and
dismounted
offered
every
possible
impediment
to
their
advance
general
meade
made
the
passage
of
the
rapidan
without
difficulty
and
as
his
expedition
was
unencumbered
with
wagons
advanced
rapidly
the
only
serious
obstruction
to
his
march
was
made
by
johnson
division
of
ewell
corps
which
had
been
thrown
out
beyond
the
run
toward
the
river
upon
this
force
the
federal
third
corps
under
general
french
suddenly
blundered
by
taking
the
wrong
road
it
is
said
and
an
active
engagement
followed
which
resulted
in
favor
of
the
southerners
the
verdict
of
lee
troops
afterward
was
that
the
enemy
fought
badly
but
general
french
probably
desired
nothing
better
than
to
shake
off
this
into
which
he
had
stumbled
and
to
reach
in
the
time
prescribed
by
general
meade
the
point
of
federal
concentration
near
robertson
tavern
toward
that
point
the
northern
forces
now
converged
from
the
various
crossings
of
the
river
and
stuart
continued
to
reconnoitre
and
feel
them
along
the
entire
front
fighting
obstinately
and
falling
back
only
when
compelled
to
do
so
every
step
was
thus
contested
with
and
the
from
far
below
to
above
church
the
federal
infantry
however
continued
steadily
to
press
forward
forcing
back
the
cavalry
and
on
the
general
meade
was
in
face
of
mine
run
lee
was
ready
hill
had
promptly
marched
and
his
corps
was
coming
into
position
on
the
right
of
ewell
receiving
intelligence
of
the
enemy
movement
only
upon
the
preceding
day
lee
had
seemed
to
move
the
divisions
of
hill
far
back
toward
charlottesville
as
by
the
wave
of
his
hand
the
army
was
concentrated
the
line
of
defence
occupied
and
general
meade
attempt
to
surprise
his
adversary
by
interposing
between
his
wings
had
resulted
in
decisive
failure
if
he
fought
now
the
battle
must
be
one
of
army
against
army
and
what
was
worst
of
all
it
was
lee
who
held
all
the
advantages
of
position
we
have
spoken
of
mine
run
it
is
a
strong
defensive
position
on
its
right
bank
and
on
its
left
flowing
generally
between
hills
and
with
banks
it
is
difficult
to
cross
from
either
side
in
face
of
an
opposing
force
and
it
was
lee
good
fortune
to
occupy
the
attitude
of
the
party
to
be
assailed
he
seemed
to
feel
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
and
was
in
excellent
spirits
as
were
the
men
an
describes
them
as
gay
lively
laughing
magnificent
in
front
of
his
left
wing
he
had
already
erected
works
his
centre
and
right
were
as
yet
undefended
but
the
task
of
strengthening
the
line
at
these
points
was
rapidly
prosecuted
lee
superintended
in
person
the
establishment
of
his
order
of
battle
and
it
was
plain
to
those
who
saw
him
thus
engaged
that
the
department
of
military
engineering
was
a
favorite
one
with
him
riding
along
the
western
bank
of
the
a
large
part
of
which
was
densely
clothed
in
oak
chestnut
and
hickory
he
selected
with
the
quick
eye
of
the
trained
engineer
the
best
position
for
his
line
promptly
moved
it
when
it
had
been
established
on
bad
ground
pointed
out
the
positions
for
artillery
and
as
he
thus
rode
slowly
along
the
works
which
he
had
directed
seemed
to
spring
up
behind
him
as
though
by
magic
as
the
troops
of
hill
came
up
and
halted
in
the
wood
the
men
seized
axes
attacked
the
large
trees
which
soon
fell
in
every
direction
and
the
heavy
logs
were
dragged
without
loss
of
time
to
the
prescribed
line
where
they
were
piled
upon
each
other
in
double
walls
which
were
filled
in
rapidly
with
earth
and
thus
in
an
inconceivably
short
space
of
time
the
men
had
defences
which
would
turn
a
in
front
for
some
distance
too
the
timber
had
been
felled
and
an
thus
formed
a
few
hours
after
the
arrival
of
the
troops
on
the
line
marked
out
by
lee
they
were
rooted
behind
excellent
breastworks
with
forest
stream
and
in
front
to
delay
the
assailing
force
under
the
fire
of
and
cannon
this
account
of
the
movements
of
the
army
and
the
preparations
made
to
receive
general
meade
attack
may
appear
of
undue
length
and
minuteness
of
detail
in
view
of
the
fact
that
no
battle
ensued
but
the
volume
before
the
reader
is
not
so
much
a
history
of
the
battles
of
virginia
which
have
often
been
described
as
an
attempt
to
delineate
the
military
and
personal
character
of
general
lee
which
displayed
itself
often
more
strikingly
in
indecisive
events
than
in
those
whose
results
attract
the
attention
of
the
world
it
was
the
vigorous
brain
indeed
of
the
great
soldier
that
made
events
indecisive
warding
off
by
military
acumen
and
ability
the
disaster
with
which
he
was
threatened
at
mine
run
lee
quick
eye
for
position
and
masterly
handling
of
his
forces
completely
checkmated
an
adversary
who
had
advanced
to
deliver
decisive
battle
with
felled
trees
breastworks
and
a
crawling
stream
lee
reversed
all
the
calculations
of
the
commander
of
the
federal
army
from
the
of
november
to
the
night
of
the
of
december
general
meade
moved
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
formidable
works
of
his
adversary
feeling
them
with
skirmishers
and
artillery
and
essaying
vainly
to
find
some
joint
in
the
armor
through
which
to
pierce
there
was
none
lee
had
inaugurated
that
great
system
of
breastworks
which
afterward
did
him
such
good
service
in
his
long
campaign
with
general
grant
a
feature
of
the
military
art
unknown
to
jomini
had
thus
its
birth
in
the
woods
of
america
and
this
fact
if
there
were
naught
else
of
interest
in
the
campaign
would
communicate
to
the
affair
the
utmost
interest
general
meade
it
seems
was
bitterly
opposed
to
foregoing
an
attack
in
spite
of
the
powerful
position
of
his
adversary
he
ordered
an
assault
it
is
said
but
this
did
not
take
place
in
consequence
it
would
appear
of
the
reluctance
of
general
warren
to
charge
the
confederate
right
this
seemed
so
strong
that
the
men
considered
it
hopeless
when
the
order
was
communicated
to
them
each
one
wrote
his
name
on
a
scrap
of
paper
and
pinned
it
to
his
breast
that
his
corpse
might
be
recognized
and
if
possible
conveyed
to
his
friends
this
was
ominous
of
failure
general
warren
suspended
the
attack
and
general
meade
it
is
said
acquiesced
in
his
decision
he
declared
it
is
related
that
he
could
carry
the
position
a
loss
of
thirty
thousand
but
as
that
idea
was
frightful
there
seemed
nothing
to
do
but
retreat
lee
seemed
to
realize
the
embarrassment
of
his
adversary
and
was
in
excellent
heart
throughout
the
whole
affair
riding
to
and
fro
along
his
line
among
his
merry
men
and
they
had
never
appeared
in
finer
spirits
or
with
greater
confidence
in
their
commander
he
addressed
encouraging
words
to
them
exposed
himself
with
entire
indifference
to
the
shelling
and
seemed
perfectly
confident
of
the
result
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
finding
a
party
of
his
ragged
soldiers
devoutly
kneeling
in
one
of
the
little
glades
behind
the
breastworks
and
holding
a
in
the
midst
of
bursting
shells
he
dismounted
took
off
his
hat
and
remained
silently
and
devoutly
listening
until
the
earnest
prayer
was
concluded
a
great
revival
was
then
going
on
in
the
army
and
thousands
were
becoming
professors
of
religion
the
fact
may
seem
strange
to
those
who
have
regarded
lee
as
only
a
and
soldier
looking
like
all
soldiers
to
military
success
but
the
religious
enthusiasm
of
his
men
in
this
autumn
of
probably
gave
him
greater
joy
than
any
successes
achieved
over
his
federal
adversary
those
who
saw
him
on
the
lines
at
mine
run
will
remember
the
composed
satisfaction
of
his
countenance
an
recalls
his
mild
face
as
he
rode
along
accompanied
by
hill
in
his
drooping
hat
simple
and
cordial

laughing

and
haggard

smile

footnote
journal
of
a
he
was
thus
attended
sitting
his
horse
upon
a
hill
near
the
left
of
his
line
when
a
staff
officer
rode
up
and
informed
him
that
the
enemy
were
making
a
heavy
demonstration
against
his
extreme
right
infantry
or
cavalry
he
asked
with
great
calmness
infantry
i
think
general
from
the
appearance
of
the
guns
general
wilcox
thinks
so
and
has
sent
a
regiment
of
to
meet
them
who
commands
the
regiment
asked
general
lee
and
it
was
to
introduce
this
question
that
this
trifle
has
been
mentioned
lee
knew
his
army
man
by
man
almost
and
could
judge
of
the
probable
result
of
the
movement
here
announced
to
him
by
the
name
of
the
officer
in
command
finding
that
general
meade
would
not
probably
venture
to
assail
him
lee
determined
on
the
night
of
december
to
attack
his
adversary
on
the
next
morning
his
mildness
on
this
night
yielded
to
soldierly
ardor
and
he
exclaimed
they
must
be
attacked
they
must
be
attacked
his
plan
is
said
to
have
contemplated
a
movement
of
his
right
wing
against
the
federal
left
flank
for
which
the
ground
afforded
great
advantages
all
was
ready
for
such
a
movement
and
the
orders
are
said
to
have
been
issued
when
as
the
dawn
broke
over
the
hills
the
federal
camps
were
seen
to
be
deserted
general
meade
had
abandoned
his
campaign
and
was
in
full
retreat
toward
the
rapidan
the
army
immediately
moved
in
pursuit
with
lee
leading
the
column
the
disappearance
of
the
enemy
was
an
astounding
event
to
them
and
they
could
scarcely
realize
it
an
entertaining
illustration
of
this
fact
is
found
in
the
journal
of
a
who
was
sent
with
an
order
to
general
hampton
in
looking
for
him
says
the
writer
i
got
far
to
our
right
and
in
a
hollow
of
the
woods
found
a
grand
guard
of
the
eleventh
cavalry
with
pickets
and
videttes
out
gravely
sitting
their
horses
and
watching
the
for
the
advance
of
an
enemy
who
was
then
retreating
across
ely
ford
stuart
was
pressing
their
rear
with
his
cavalry
while
the
infantry
were
steadily
advancing
but
the
pursuit
was
vain
general
meade
had
disappeared
like
a
phantom
and
was
beyond
pursuit
to
the
extreme
regret
and
disappointment
of
general
lee
who
halted
his
troops
in
great
discouragement
at
parker
store
tell
general
stuart
he
said
with
an
air
of
deep
melancholy
to
an
officer
whom
he
saw
passing
that
i
had
received
his
dispatch
when
he
turned
into
the
brock
road
and
have
halted
my
infantry
here
not
wishing
to
march
them
unnecessarily
even
at
that
early
hour
all
chance
of
effective
pursuit
was
lost
general
meade
without
wagons
and
not
even
with
the
weight
of
the
rations
brought
over
which
the
men
had
consumed
had
moved
with
the
rapidity
of
cavalry
and
was
already
crossing
the
river
far
below
he
was
afterward
asked
by
a
gentleman
of
culpepper
whether
in
crossing
the
rapidan
he
designed
a
real
advance
certainly
he
is
reported
by
the
gentleman
in
question
to
have
replied
i
meant
to
go
to
richmond
if
i
could
but
lee
position
was
so
strong
that
to
storm
it
would
have
cost
me
thirty
thousand
men
i
could
not
remain
without
a
battle
the
weather
was
so
cold
that
my
sentinels
froze
to
death
on
post
the
pursuit
was
speedily
abandoned
by
general
lee
as
entirely
impracticable
and
the
men
were
marched
back
between
the
burning
woods
set
on
fire
by
the
federal
campfires
the
spectacle
was
imposing
the
numerous
fires
burning
outerward
in
the
carpet
of
thick
leaves
formed
picturesque
rings
of
flame
resembling
brilliant
necklaces
and
as
the
flames
reached
the
tall
trees
wrapped
to
the
summit
in
dry
vines
these
would
blaze
aloft
like
gigantic
torches
true
torches
of
war
let
fall
by
the
federal
commander
in
his
hasty
retrograde
hours
afterward
the
larger
part
of
general
lee
army
were
back
in
their
in
less
than
a
week
the
campaign
had
begun
and
ended
the
movement
of
general
meade
might
have
been
compared
to
that
of
the
king
of
france
and
his
forty
thousand
men
in
the
song
but
the
campaign
was
not
ill
devised
was
rather
the
dictate
of
sound
military
judgment
all
that
defeated
it
was
the
extreme
promptness
of
lee
the
excellent
choice
of
position
and
the
beginning
of
that
great
system
of
impromptu
breastworks
which
afterward
became
so
powerful
an
engine
against
general
grant
vi
lee
in
the
autumn
and
winter
of
general
lee
headquarters
remained
throughout
the
autumn
and
winter
of
in
a
wood
on
the
southern
slope
of
the
spur
called
mountain
a
few
miles
east
of
orange
here
his
tents
had
been
pitched
in
a
cleared
space
amid
pines
and
cedars
and
the
ingenuity
of
the
couriers
as
messengers
and
orderlies
were
called
in
the
southern
army
had
fashioned
alleys
and
walks
leading
to
the
various
tents
the
tent
of
the
commanding
general
occupying
the
centre
of
the
gentlemen
of
general
lee
staff
we
have
not
considered
it
necessary
to
speak
but
it
may
here
be
said
that
it
was
composed
of
officers
of
great
efficiency
and
of
the
most
courteous
manners
from
colonel
taylor
the
indefatigable
to
the
youngest
and
least
prominent
member
of
the
friendly
group
among
these
able
assistants
of
the
were
colonel
marshall
of
maryland
a
gentleman
of
distinguished
intellect
colonel
peyton
who
had
entered
the
battle
of
manassas
as
a
private
in
the
ranks
but
on
the
evening
of
that
day
for
courage
and
efficiency
occupied
the
place
of
a
commissioned
officer
on
beauregard
staff
and
others
whose
names
were
comparatively
unknown
to
the
army
but
whose
part
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
under
direction
of
lee
was
most
important
with
the
gentlemen
of
his
staff
general
lee
lived
on
terms
of
the
most
kindly
regard
he
was
a
strict
disciplinarian
and
abhorred
the
theory
that
a
commissioned
officer
from
considerations
of
rank
should
hold
himself
above
the
private
soldiers
but
there
was
certainly
no
fault
of
this
description
to
be
found
at
army
headquarters
and
the
general
and
his
staff
worked
together
in
harmonious
coöperation
the
respect
felt
for
him
by
gentlemen
who
saw
him
at
all
hours
and
under
none
of
the
guise
of
ceremony
was
probably
greater
than
that
experienced
by
the
community
who
looked
upon
him
from
a
distance
that
distant
perspective
hiding
little
weaknesses
and
revealing
only
the
great
proportions
of
a
human
being
is
said
to
be
essential
generally
to
the
heroic
sublime
no
man
it
has
been
said
can
be
great
to
those
always
near
him
but
in
the
case
of
general
lee
this
was
far
from
being
the
fact
he
seemed
greater
and
nobler
day
by
day
as
he
was
better
and
more
intimately
known
and
upon
this
point
we
shall
quote
the
words
of
the
brave
john
gordon
one
of
his
most
trusted
lieutenants
it
has
been
my
fortune
in
life
says
general
gordon
from
circumstances
to
have
come
in
contact
with
some
whom
the
world
pronounced
great
some
of
the
earth
celebrated
and
distinguished
but
i
declare
it
here
that
of
any
mortal
man
whom
it
has
ever
been
my
privilege
to
approach
he
was
the
greatest
and
i
assert
here
that
as
might
be
your
conception
of
the
man
before
he
arose
in
incomparable
majesty
on
more
familiar
this
can
be
affirmed
of
few
men
who
have
ever
lived
or
died
and
of
no
other
man
whom
it
has
ever
been
my
fortune
to
approach
like
niagara
the
more
you
gazed
the
more
its
grandeur
grew
upon
you
the
more
its
majesty
expanded
and
filled
your
spirit
with
a
full
satisfaction
that
left
a
perfect
delight
without
the
slightest
feeling
of
oppression
grandly
majestic
and
dignified
in
all
his
deportment
he
was
genial
as
the
sunlight
of
this
beautiful
day
and
not
a
ray
of
that
cordial
social
intercourse
but
brought
warmth
to
the
heart
as
it
did
light
to
the
understanding
upon
this
point
general
breckinridge
too
bears
his
testimony
during
the
last
year
of
that
unfortunate
struggle
he
says
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
with
him
i
was
almost
constantly
by
his
side
and
it
was
during
the
two
months
immediately
preceding
the
fall
of
richmond
that
i
came
to
know
and
fully
understand
the
true
nobility
of
his
character
in
all
those
long
vigils
he
was
considerate
and
kind
gentle
firm
and
i
can
give
no
better
idea
of
the
impression
it
made
upon
me
than
to
say
it
inspired
me
with
an
ardent
love
of
the
man
and
a
profound
veneration
of
his
character
it
was
so
massive
and
noble
so
grand
in
its
proportions
that
all
men
must
admire
its
heroism
and
gallantry
yet
so
gentle
and
tender
that
a
woman
might
adopt
and
claim
it
as
her
own
we
beg
the
reader
to
observe
that
in
these
two
tributes
to
the
worth
of
the
great
soldier
his
distinguished
associates
dwell
with
peculiar
emphasis
upon
the
charms
of
private
intercourse
with
him
and
bear
their
testimony
to
the
fact
that
to
know
him
better
was
to
love
and
admire
him
more
and
more
the
fact
is
easily
explained
there
was
in
this
human
being
character
naught
that
was
insincere
assumed
or
pretentious
it
was
a
great
and
massive
soul
as
gentle
too
and
tender
as
a
woman
or
a
child
that
lay
beneath
the
reserved
exterior
and
made
the
soldier
more
beloved
as
its
qualities
were
better
known
other
men
reveal
their
weaknesses
on
nearer
acquaintance
lee
only
revealed
his
greatness
and
he
was
more
and
more
loved
and
admired
the
justice
of
these
comments
will
be
recognized
by
all
who
had
personal
intercourse
with
the
illustrious
soldier
and
in
this
autumn
and
winter
of
his
army
lying
around
him
along
the
rapidan
began
to
form
that
more
intimate
acquaintance
which
uniformly
resulted
in
profound
admiration
for
the
man
in
the
great
campaigns
of
the
two
past
years
the
gray
soldier
had
shared
their
hardships
and
never
relaxed
his
fatherly
care
for
all
their
wants
he
had
led
them
in
battle
exposing
his
own
person
with
entire
indifference
had
never
exposed
when
it
was
possible
to
avoid
it
and
on
every
occasion
had
demanded
often
with
disagreeable
persistence
from
the
civil
authorities
that
the
wants
of
his
veterans
should
be
supplied
if
all
else
was
neglected
these
facts
were
now
known
to
the
troops
and
made
lee
immensely
popular
from
the
highest
officers
to
the
humblest
private
soldiers
he
was
universally
respected
and
beloved
the
whole
army
seemed
to
feel
that
in
the
soldier
sleeping
like
themselves
under
canvas
in
the
woods
of
orange
they
had
a
guiding
and
protecting
head
ever
studious
of
their
jealous
of
their
fame
and
ready
both
as
friend
and
commander
to
represent
them
and
claim
their
due
we
have
spoken
of
the
great
revival
of
religion
which
at
this
time
took
place
in
the
army
the
touching
spectacle
was
presented
of
bearded
veterans
who
had
charged
in
a
score
of
combats
kneeling
devoutly
under
the
rustic
roofs
of
evergreens
built
for
religious
gatherings
and
praying
to
the
god
of
battles
who
had
so
long
protected
them
a
of
the
old
european
school
might
have
ridiculed
these
emotional
assemblages
or
at
best
passed
them
without
notice
as
freaks
in
which
he
disdained
to
take
part
lee
on
the
contrary
greeted
the
religious
enthusiasm
of
his
troops
with
undisguised
pleasure
he
went
among
them
conversed
with
the
chaplains
assisted
the
good
work
by
every
means
in
his
power
and
no
ordained
minister
of
the
gospel
could
have
exhibited
a
simpler
sincerer
or
more
heartfelt
delight
than
himself
at
the
general
extension
of
religious
feeling
throughout
the
army
we
have
related
how
in
talking
with
his
cheeks
flushed
and
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
at
the
good
tidings
he
begged
them
to
pray
for
him
too
as
no
less
needing
their
pious
intercession
and
in
making
the
request
he
was
as
always
simple
and
sincere
unaccustomed
to
exhibit
his
feelings
upon
this
the
profoundest
and
most
sacred
of
subjects
he
was
yet
penetrated
to
his
inmost
soul
by
a
sense
of
his
own
weakness
and
dependence
on
divine
support
and
indeed
it
may
be
questioned
whether
any
other
element
of
the
great
soldier
character
was
so
and
controlling
as
his
spirit
of
love
to
god
it
took
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
form
of
a
love
of
duty
but
with
lee
the
word
duty
was
but
another
name
for
the
will
of
the
almighty
and
to
discover
and
perform
this
was
first
and
last
the
sole
aim
of
his
life
we
elaborate
this
point
before
passing
to
the
last
great
campaign
of
the
war
since
to
understand
lee
in
those
last
days
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
keep
in
view
this
utter
subjection
of
the
man
heart
to
the
sense
of
an
overruling
providence
that
providence
which
shapes
our
ends
them
how
we
will
we
shall
be
called
upon
to
delineate
the
soldier
meeting
adverse
circumstances
and
disaster
at
every
turn
with
an
imperial
calmness
and
a
resolution
that
never
shook
and
up
to
a
certain
point
this
noble
composure
may
be
attributed
to
the
stubborn
courage
of
the
man
nature
there
came
in
due
time
however
a
moment
of
trial
when
military
courage
simply
was
of
no
avail
when
that
human
being
never
lived
who
looking
to
earthly
support
alone
would
not
have
lost
heart
and
given
up
the
contest
lee
did
not
in
this
hour
of
conclusive
trial
either
lose
heart
or
give
up
the
struggle
and
the
world
not
understanding
the
phenomenon
gazed
at
him
with
wonder
few
were
aware
of
the
true
explanation
of
his
utter
serenity
when
all
things
were
crumbling
around
him
and
when
he
knew
that
they
were
crumbling
the
stout
heart
of
the
soldier
who
will
not
yield
to
fate
was
in
his
breast
but
he
had
a
still
stronger
sentiment
than
manly
courage
to
support
him
the
consciousness
that
he
was
doing
his
duty
and
that
god
watched
over
him
and
would
make
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
those
who
loved
him
as
yet
that
last
great
wrestle
of
the
opposing
armies
lay
in
the
future
the
veterans
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
defended
the
line
of
the
rapidan
and
the
gray
in
his
tent
on
clarke
mountain
serenely
awaited
the
further
movements
of
the
enemy
during
the
long
months
of
winter
he
was
busily
engaged
as
usual
in
official
correspondence
in
looking
to
the
welfare
of
his
men
and
in
preparations
for
the
coming
campaign
he
often
rode
among
the
camps
and
the
familiar
figure
in
the
hat
cape
and
gray
uniform
mounted
upon
the
powerful
the
famous
traveller
who
survived
to
bear
his
master
after
the
war
was
everywhere
greeted
by
the
ragged
veterans
with
cheers
and
marks
of
the
highest
respect
and
regard
at
times
his
rides
were
extended
to
the
banks
of
the
rapidan
and
in
passing
he
would
stop
at
the
headquarters
of
general
stuart
or
other
officers
on
these
occasions
he
had
always
some
speech
for
all
not
overlooking
the
youngest
officer
but
he
shone
in
the
most
amiable
light
perhaps
in
conversing
with
some
old
private
soldier
like
himself
at
such
moments
the
general
countenance
was
a
pleasant
spectacle
a
kindly
smile
lit
up
the
clear
eyes
and
moved
the
lips
by
the
grizzled
mustache
the
of
this
smile
was
irresistible
and
the
aged
private
soldier
in
his
poor
tattered
was
made
to
feel
by
it
that
his
regarded
him
as
a
friend
and
comrade
we
dwell
at
too
great
length
perhaps
upon
these
slight
personal
traits
of
the
soldier
but
all
relating
to
such
a
human
being
is
interesting
and
worthy
of
record
to
the
writer
indeed
this
is
the
most
attractive
phase
of
his
subject
the
analysis
and
description
of
campaigns
and
battles
is
an
unattractive
task
to
him
but
the
personal
delineation
of
a
good
and
great
man
even
in
his
lesser
and
more
familiar
traits
is
a
pleasing
relief
a
portion
of
his
subject
upon
which
he
delights
to
linger
what
the
writer
here
tries
to
draw
he
looked
upon
with
his
own
eyes
the
figure
of
a
great
calm
soldier
with
kindly
sweetness
and
dignity
but
above
all
a
charming
sincerity
and
simplicity
in
every
movement
accent
and
expression
entirely
free
from
the
trappings
of
high
command
and
with
nothing
to
distinguish
him
from
any
other
soldier
save
the
stars
on
the
collar
of
his
the
was
recognizable
at
the
very
first
glance
and
no
less
the
simple
and
kindly
gentleman
his
old
soldiers
remember
him
as
he
appeared
on
many
and
will
describe
his
martial
seat
in
the
saddle
as
he
advanced
with
the
advancing
lines
but
they
will
speak
of
him
with
even
greater
pleasure
as
he
appeared
in
the
winters
of
and
on
the
rappahannock
and
the
rapidan
a
gray
and
simple
soldier
riding
among
them
and
smiling
kindly
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
their
tattered
uniforms
and
familiar
faces
part
viii

and

general
grant
crosses
the
rapidan
in
the
first
days
of
may
began
the
immense
campaign
which
was
to
terminate
only
with
the
fall
of
the
confederacy
for
this
which
was
regarded
as
the
decisive
trial
of
strength
the
federal
authorities
had
made
elaborate
preparations
new
levies
were
raised
by
draft
to
fill
up
the
ranks
of
the
depleted
forces
great
masses
of
war
material
were
accumulated
at
the
central
depots
at
washington
and
the
government
summoned
from
the
west
an
officer
of
high
reputation
to
conduct
hostilities
on
what
was
more
plainly
than
ever
before
seen
to
be
the
theatre
of
decisive
conflict
virginia
the
officer
in
question
was
general
ulysses
grant
who
had
received
the
repute
of
eminent
military
ability
by
his
operations
in
the
west
he
was
now
commissioned
and
president
lincoln
assigned
him
to
the
command
of
all
the
armies
of
the
united
states
at
that
time
estimated
to
number
one
million
men
general
grant
promptly
accepted
the
trust
confided
to
him
and
relinquishing
to
sherman
the
command
of
the
western
forces
proceeded
to
culpepper
and
assumed
personal
command
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
although
nominally
that
army
remained
under
command
of
general
meade
the
spring
campaign
was
preceded
in
february
by
two
movements
of
the
federal
forces
one
the
advance
of
general
butler
up
the
peninsula
to
the
chickahominy
where
for
a
few
hours
he
threatened
richmond
only
to
retire
hastily
when
opposed
by
a
few
local
troops
the
other
the
expedition
of
general
kilpatrick
with
a
body
of
cavalry
from
the
rapidan
toward
richmond
with
the
view
of
releasing
the
federal
prisoners
there
this
failed
completely
like
the
expedition
up
the
peninsula
general
kilpatrick
after
threatening
the
city
rapidly
retreated
and
a
portion
of
his
command
under
colonel
dahlgren
was
pursued
and
a
large
portion
killed
including
their
commander
it
is
to
be
hoped
for
the
honor
of
human
nature
that
colonel
dahlgren
designs
were
different
from
those
which
are
attributed
to
him
on
what
seems
unassailable
proof
papers
found
upon
his
body
contained
minute
directions
for
releasing
the
prisoners
and
giving
up
the
city
to
them
and
for
putting
to
death
the
confederate
president
and
his
cabinet
to
return
to
the
more
important
events
on
the
rapidan
general
grant
assumed
the
direction
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
under
most
favorable
auspices
other
commanders
especially
general
mcclellan
had
labored
under
painful
disadvantages
from
the
absence
of
coöperation
and
good
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
authorities
the
new
leader
entered
upon
the
great
struggle
under
very
different
circumstances
personally
and
politically
acceptable
to
the
government
he
received
their
hearty
coöperation
all
power
was
placed
in
his
hands
he
was
enabled
to
concentrate
in
virginia
the
best
troops
in
large
numbers
and
the
character
of
this
force
seemed
to
promise
him
assured
victory
general
mcclellan
and
others
had
commanded
troops
comparatively
raw
and
were
opposed
by
confederate
armies
in
the
full
flush
of
anticipated
success
general
grant
had
now
under
him
an
army
of
veterans
and
the
enemy
he
was
opposed
to
had
month
by
month
lost
strength
under
these
circumstances
it
seemed
that
he
ought
to
succeed
in
crushing
his
adversary
the
federal
army
present
and
ready
for
duty
may
numbered
one
hundred
and
thousand
one
hundred
and
men
that
of
general
lee
numbered
thousand
six
hundred
and
colonel
taylor
of
the
army
states
the
strictly
effective
at
a
little
less
viz
ewell
hill
longstreet
infantry
cavalry
and
artillery
total
the
two
statements
do
not
materially
differ
and
require
no
discussion
the
force
at
lee
command
was
a
little
over
of
general
grant
and
if
it
be
true
that
the
latter
commander
continued
to
receive
reënforcements
between
the
and
days
of
may
when
he
crossed
the
rapidan
lee
force
was
probably
less
than
of
his
adversary
longstreet
it
will
be
seen
had
been
brought
back
from
the
west
but
the
confederates
labored
under
an
even
more
serious
disadvantage
than
want
of
sufficient
force
lee
army
small
as
it
was
was
wretchedly
supplied
half
the
men
were
in
rags
and
worse
still
were
but
fed
against
this
suicidal
policy
in
reference
to
an
army
upon
which
depended
the
fate
of
the
south
general
lee
had
protested
in
vain
whether
from
fault
in
the
authorities
or
from
circumstances
over
which
they
could
exercise
no
control
adequate
supplies
of
food
did
not
reach
the
army
and
when
it
marched
to
meet
the
enemy
in
the
first
days
of
may
the
men
were
gaunt
and
in
no
condition
to
enter
upon
so
arduous
a
campaign
there
was
naught
to
be
done
however
but
to
fight
on
to
the
end
upon
the
army
of
northern
virginia
depleted
by
casualties
and
unprovided
with
the
commonest
necessaries
depended
the
fate
of
the
struggle
generals
grant
and
lee
fully
realized
that
fact
and
the
federal
commander
had
the
acumen
to
perceive
that
the
conflict
was
to
be
long
and
determined
he
indulged
no
anticipations
of
an
early
or
easy
success
his
plan
as
stated
in
his
official
report
was
to
against
the
armed
force
of
the
enemy
and
his
resources
until
mere
if
by
nothing
else
there
should
be
nothing
left
of
him
but
an
equal
submission
with
the
loyal
section
of
our
common
country
to
the
constitution
and
the
laws
the
frightful
cost
in
blood
of
this
policy
of
hammering
continuously
and
thus
wearing
away
his
strength
by
mere
attrition
did
or
did
not
occur
to
general
grant
in
either
case
he
is
not
justly
to
be
blamed
it
was
the
only
policy
which
promised
to
result
in
federal
success
pitched
battles
had
been
tried
for
nearly
three
years
and
in
victory
or
in
defeat
the
southern
army
seemed
equally
unshaken
and
dangerous
this
fact
was
now
felt
and
acknowledged
even
by
its
enemies
army
said
a
northern
writer
referring
to
it
at
this
time
is
an
army
of
veterans
it
is
an
instrument
sharpened
to
a
perfect
edge
you
turn
its
flanks
well
its
flanks
are
made
to
be
turned
this
effects
little
or
nothing
all
that
we
reckon
as
gained
therefore
is
the
loss
of
life
inflicted
on
the
enemy
with
an
army
thus
trained
in
many
combats
and
hardened
against
misfortune
defeat
in
one
or
a
dozen
battles
decided
nothing
general
grant
seems
to
have
understood
this
and
to
have
resolutely
adopted
the
programme
of
attrition
coldly
estimating
that
even
if
he
lost
ten
men
to
general
lee
one
he
could
better
endure
that
loss
and
could
afford
it
if
thereby
he
crushed
the
rebellion
the
military
theory
of
the
federal
commander
having
thus
been
set
forth
in
his
own
words
it
remains
to
notice
his
programme
for
the
approaching
campaign
he
had
hesitated
between
two
plans
one
to
cross
the
rapidan
below
lee
moving
by
his
right
flank
the
other
above
moving
by
his
left
the
last
was
abandoned
from
the
difficulty
of
keeping
open
communication
with
any
base
of
supplies
and
the
latter
adopted
general
grant
determined
to
fight
lee
between
culpepper
and
richmond
if
he
would
stand
to
advance
straight
upon
the
city
and
invest
it
from
the
north
and
west
thereby
cutting
its
communications
in
three
directions
and
then
crossing
the
james
river
above
the
city
form
a
junction
with
the
left
of
butler
who
moving
with
about
thirty
thousand
men
from
fortress
monroe
at
the
moment
when
the
army
of
the
potomac
crossed
the
rapidan
was
to
occupy
city
point
advance
thence
up
the
south
side
of
james
river
and
reach
a
position
where
the
two
armies
might
thus
unite
it
is
proper
to
keep
in
view
this
programme
of
general
grant
lee
completely
reversed
it
by
promptly
moving
in
front
of
his
adversary
at
every
step
which
he
took
in
advance
and
it
will
be
seen
that
the
federal
commander
was
finally
compelled
to
adopt
a
plan
which
does
not
seem
to
have
entered
his
mind
save
as
a
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
general
grant
commenced
crossing
the
rapidan
at
germanna
and
other
fords
above
chancellorsville
and
by
the
morning
of
the
his
army
was
over
it
appears
from
his
report
that
he
had
not
anticipated
so
easy
a
passage
of
the
stream
and
greatly
felicitated
himself
upon
effecting
it
so
successfully
this
i
regarded
he
says
as
a
great
success
and
it
removed
from
my
mind
the
most
serious
apprehension
i
had
entertained
that
of
crossing
the
river
in
the
face
of
an
active
large
and
army
lee
had
made
no
movement
to
dispute
the
passage
of
the
stream
from
the
fact
perhaps
that
his
army
was
either
large
or
he
preferred
to
await
the
appearance
of
his
adversary
and
direct
an
assault
on
the
flank
of
his
column
as
it
passed
across
his
front
from
a
speech
attributed
to
general
meade
it
would
seem
to
have
been
the
impression
in
the
federal
army
that
lee
designed
falling
back
to
a
defensive
position
somewhere
near
the
south
anna
his
movements
were
however
very
different
instead
of
retiring
before
general
grant
in
the
direction
of
richmond
he
moved
with
his
three
corps
toward
the
wilderness
to
offer
battle
illustration
routes
of
lee
grant
may
and
june
the
head
of
the
column
consisted
of
ewell
corps
which
had
retained
its
position
on
the
rapidan
forming
the
right
of
lee
line
general
hill
who
had
been
stationed
higher
up
near
liberty
mills
followed
and
longstreet
who
lay
near
gordonsville
brought
up
the
rear
these
dispositions
dictated
as
will
be
seen
the
positions
of
the
three
commands
in
the
ensuing
struggle
ewell
advanced
in
front
down
the
old
turnpike
that
one
of
the
two
great
highways
here
running
east
and
west
which
is
nearest
the
rapidan
hill
came
on
over
the
orange
a
little
south
of
the
turnpike
and
thus
formed
on
ewell
right
and
longstreet
following
came
in
on
the
right
of
hill
general
grant
had
plunged
with
his
army
into
the
dense
and
melancholy
thicket
which
had
been
the
scene
of
general
hooker
discomfiture
his
army
followed
by
its
great
train
of
four
thousand
wagons
indicating
the
important
nature
of
the
movement
had
reached
wilderness
tavern
and
that
brock
road
over
which
jackson
advanced
in
his
secret
against
the
federal
right
in
may
in
may
of
now
another
federal
army
had
penetrated
the
sombre
and
depressing
shadows
of
the
interminable
thickets
of
the
wilderness
and
a
more
determined
struggle
than
the
first
was
to
mark
with
its
bloody
hand
this
historic
territory
ii
the
first
collision
in
the
wilderness
to
understand
the
singular
combat
which
now
ensued
it
is
necessary
to
keep
in
view
the
fact
that
nothing
more
surprised
general
grant
than
the
sudden
appearance
of
his
adversary
face
to
face
with
him
in
the
wilderness
it
had
not
been
supposed
either
by
the
or
his
that
lee
with
his
small
army
would
have
recourse
to
a
proceeding
so
audacious
it
was
anticipated
indeed
that
somewhere
on
the
road
to
richmond
lee
would
make
a
stand
and
fight
in
a
position
which
would
enable
him
to
risk
collision
with
his
great
adversary
but
that
lee
himself
would
bring
on
this
collision
by
making
an
open
attack
unassisted
by
position
of
any
sort
was
the
last
thing
which
seems
to
have
occurred
to
his
adversary
such
however
as
has
been
said
was
the
design
from
the
first
of
the
southern
commander
and
he
moved
with
his
accustomed
celerity
and
energy
as
soon
as
general
grant
broke
up
his
camps
north
of
the
rapidan
lee
was
apprised
of
the
fact
and
ordered
his
three
corps
to
concentrate
in
the
direction
of
chancellorsville
those
who
were
present
in
the
southern
army
at
this
time
will
bear
record
to
the
soldierly
promptness
of
officers
and
men
on
the
evening
of
the
of
may
the
camps
were
the
scenes
of
noise
merriment
and
parade
the
bands
played
the
woods
were
alive
nothing
disturbed
the
scene
of
general
enjoyment
of
on
the
morning
of
the
all
this
was
changed
the
camps
were
deserted
no
sound
was
anywhere
heard
the
troops
were
twenty
miles
away
fully
armed
and
ready
for
battle
general
lee
was
in
the
saddle
and
his
presence
seemed
to
push
forward
his
column
ewell
marching
with
celerity
bivouacked
that
night
directly
in
face
of
the
enemy
and
it
was
the
presence
of
the
troops
of
this
commander
which
arrested
general
grant
advancing
steadily
in
the
direction
of
spottsylvania
he
must
have
inwardly
chafed
at
a
circumstance
so
unexpected
and
embarrassing
it
had
been
no
part
of
his
plan
to
fight
in
the
thickets
of
the
wilderness
and
yet
an
adversary
of
but
his
own
strength
was
about
to
reverse
his
whole
programme
and
dictate
the
terms
of
the
first
battles
of
the
campaign
there
was
nothing
to
do
however
but
to
fight
and
general
grant
hastened
to
form
order
of
battle
for
that
purpose
with
general
sedgwick
commanding
his
right
generals
warren
and
burnside
his
centre
and
general
hancock
his
left
near
the
brock
road
the
line
thus
formed
extended
from
northwest
to
southeast
and
as
the
right
wing
was
in
advance
with
respect
to
lee
that
circumstance
occasioned
the
first
collision
this
occurred
about
on
the
of
may
and
was
brought
on
by
general
warren
who
attacked
the
head
of
swell
column
on
the
old
turnpike
an
obstinate
engagement
ensued
and
the
division
which
received
the
assault
was
forced
back
it
quickly
however
reformed
and
being
reënforced
advanced
in
turn
against
general
warren
and
after
a
hard
fight
he
was
driven
back
with
a
loss
of
three
thousand
men
and
two
pieces
of
artillery
this
first
collision
of
the
armies
on
the
confederate
left
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
a
bloody
struggle
on
the
centre
this
was
held
by
hill
who
had
marched
down
the
and
was
near
the
important
point
of
junction
of
that
road
with
the
brock
road
when
he
was
suddenly
attacked
by
the
enemy
the
struggle
which
ensued
was
long
and
determined
general
lee
wrote
the
assaults
were
repeated
and
desperate
but
every
one
was
repulsed
when
night
fell
hill
had
not
been
driven
back
but
had
not
advanced
and
the
two
armies
rested
on
their
arms
awaiting
the
return
of
light
to
continue
the
battle
iii
the
battle
of
the
of
may
the
morning
of
the
of
may
came
and
with
the
first
light
of
dawn
the
adversaries
as
by
a
common
understanding
advanced
at
the
same
moment
to
attack
each
other
the
battle
which
followed
is
wellnigh
indescribable
and
may
be
said
in
general
terms
to
have
been
naught
but
the
blind
and
desperate
clutch
of
two
great
bodies
of
men
who
could
scarcely
see
each
other
when
they
were
but
a
few
feet
apart
and
who
fired
at
random
rather
by
sound
than
sight
a
southern
writer
describing
the
country
and
the
strange
combat
says
the
country
was
sombre
a
land
of
thicket
undergrowth
jungle
ooze
where
men
could
not
see
each
other
twenty
yards
off
and
assaults
had
to
be
made
by
the
compass
the
fights
there
were
not
even
as
easy
as
night
attacks
in
open
country
for
at
night
you
can
travel
by
the
stars
death
came
unseen
regiments
stumbled
on
each
other
and
sent
swift
destruction
into
each
ranks
guided
by
the
crackling
of
the
bushes
it
was
not
war
military
manoeuvring
science
had
as
little
to
do
with
it
as
sight
two
wild
animals
were
hunting
each
other
when
they
heard
each
other
steps
they
sprung
and
grappled
the
conqueror
advanced
or
went
elsewhere
the
dead
were
lost
from
all
eyes
in
the
thicket
the
curious
spectacle
was
here
presented
of
officers
advancing
to
the
charge
in
the
jungle
in
attacking
not
by
sight
but
by
the
bearing
of
the
needle
in
this
mournful
and
desolate
thicket
did
the
great
campaign
of
begin
here
in
blind
wrestle
as
at
midnight
did
two
hundred
thousand
men
in
blue
and
gray
clutch
each
other
bloodiest
and
weirdest
of
encounters
war
had
had
nothing
like
it
the
genius
of
destruction
tired
apparently
of
the
old
commonplace
killing
had
invented
the
death
at
five
in
the
morning
the
opponents
closed
in
breast
to
breast
in
the
thicket
each
had
thrown
up
here
and
there
slight
temporary
breastworks
of
saplings
and
dirt
beyond
this
they
were
unprotected
the
question
now
was
which
would
succeed
in
driving
his
adversary
from
these
defences
almost
within
a
few
yards
of
each
other
and
from
behind
which
crackled
the
musketry
never
was
sight
more
curious
on
the
low
line
of
these
works
dimly
seen
in
the
thicket
rested
the
muzzles
spouting
flame
from
the
depths
rose
cheers
charges
were
made
and
repulsed
the
lines
scarcely
seeing
each
other
men
fell
and
writhed
and
died
unseen
their
bodies
lost
in
the
bushes
their
drowned
in
the
steady
continuous
crash
these
sentences
convey
a
not
incorrect
idea
of
the
general
character
of
this
remarkable
engagement
which
had
no
precedent
in
the
war
we
shall
now
proceed
to
speak
of
general
lee
plans
and
objects
and
to
indicate
where
they
failed
or
succeeded
the
commanders
of
both
armies
labored
under
great
embarrassments
general
grant
was
the
singular
character
of
the
country
with
which
he
was
wholly
unacquainted
and
general
lee
the
delay
in
the
arrival
of
longstreet
owing
to
the
distance
of
the
camps
of
the
officer
he
had
not
at
dawn
reached
the
field
of
battle
as
his
presence
was
indispensable
to
a
general
assault
this
delay
in
his
appearance
threatened
to
result
in
unfortunate
consequences
as
it
was
nearly
certain
that
general
grant
would
make
an
early
and
resolute
attack
under
these
circumstances
lee
resolved
to
commence
the
action
and
did
so
counting
doubtless
on
his
ability
with
the
thirty
thousand
men
at
his
command
to
at
least
maintain
his
ground
his
plan
seems
to
have
been
to
make
a
heavy
demonstration
against
the
federal
right
and
when
longstreet
arrived
throw
the
weight
of
his
whole
centre
and
right
against
the
federal
left
with
the
view
of
seizing
the
brock
road
running
southward
and
forcing
back
the
enemy
left
wing
into
the
thickets
around
chancellorsville
this
brilliant
conception
which
if
carried
out
would
have
arrested
general
grant
in
the
beginning
of
his
campaign
was
very
near
meeting
with
success
the
attack
on
the
federal
right
under
general
sedgwick
commenced
at
dawn
and
the
fighting
on
both
sides
was
obstinate
it
continued
with
indecisive
results
throughout
the
morning
gradually
involving
the
federal
centre
but
nearly
at
the
moment
when
it
began
a
still
more
obstinate
conflict
was
inaugurated
between
general
hancock
holding
the
federal
left
and
hill
who
opposed
him
on
the
the
battle
raged
in
this
quarter
with
great
fury
for
some
time
but
attacked
in
front
and
flank
at
once
by
his
able
opponent
hill
was
forced
back
steadily
and
at
last
in
some
disorder
a
considerable
distance
from
the
ground
which
had
witnessed
the
commencement
of
the
action
at
this
point
however
he
was
fortunately
met
by
longstreet
that
commander
rapidly
brought
his
troops
into
line
met
the
advancing
enemy
attacked
them
with
great
fury
and
after
a
bloody
contest
in
which
general
wadsworth
was
killed
drove
them
back
to
their
original
position
on
the
brock
road
it
now
seemed
nearly
certain
that
lee
plan
of
seizing
upon
this
important
highway
would
succeed
general
hancock
had
been
forced
back
with
heavy
loss
longstreet
was
pressing
on
and
as
he
afterward
said
he
thought
he
had
another
bull
run
on
them
when
a
singular
casualty
defeated
all
general
longstreet
who
had
ridden
in
front
of
his
advancing
line
turned
to
ride
back
when
he
was
mistaken
by
his
own
men
for
a
federal
cavalryman
fired
upon
and
disabled
by
a
this
threw
all
into
disorder
and
the
advance
was
discontinued
general
lee
as
soon
as
he
was
apprised
of
the
accident
hastened
to
take
personal
command
of
the
corps
and
as
soon
as
order
was
restored
directed
the
line
to
press
forward
the
most
bloody
and
determined
struggle
of
the
day
ensued
the
thicket
filled
the
valleys
and
as
at
chancellorsville
a
new
horror
was
added
to
the
horror
of
battle
a
fire
broke
out
in
the
thicket
and
soon
wrapped
the
adversaries
in
flame
and
smoke
they
fought
on
however
amid
the
crackling
flames
lee
continued
to
press
forward
the
federal
breastworks
along
a
portion
of
their
front
were
carried
and
a
part
of
general
hancock
line
was
driven
from
the
field
the
struggle
had
however
been
decisive
of
no
important
results
and
from
the
lateness
of
the
hour
when
it
terminated
it
could
not
be
followed
up
on
the
left
lee
had
also
met
with
marked
but
equally
indecisive
success
general
gordon
had
attacked
the
federal
right
driven
the
force
at
that
point
in
disorder
from
their
works
and
but
for
the
darkness
this
success
might
have
been
followed
up
and
turned
into
a
complete
defeat
of
that
wing
of
the
enemy
it
was
only
discovered
on
the
next
morning
what
important
successes
gordon
had
effected
with
a
single
brigade
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
with
a
larger
force
this
able
soldier
might
have
achieved
results
of
a
decisive
character
footnote
general
early
in
his
memoir
of
the
last
year
of
the
war
for
independence
bears
his
testimony
to
the
important
character
of
the
blow
struck
by
general
gordon
he
says
at
light
on
the
morning
of
the
an
advance
was
made
which
disclosed
the
fact
that
the
enemy
had
given
up
his
line
of
works
in
front
of
my
whole
line
and
a
good
portion
of
johnson
between
the
lines
a
large
number
of
his
dead
had
been
left
and
at
his
breastworks
a
large
number
of
muskets
and
knapsacks
had
been
abandoned
and
there
was
every
indication
of
great
confusion
it
was
not
till
then
that
we
understood
the
full
extent
of
the
success
attending
the
movement
of
the
evening
before
general
gordon
had
proposed
making
the
attack
on
the
of
the
but
was
overruled
such
had
been
the
character
and
results
of
the
first
conflicts
between
the
two
armies
in
the
thickets
of
the
wilderness
as
we
have
already
said
the
collision
there
was
neither
expected
nor
desired
by
general
grant
who
unlike
general
hooker
in
may
of
the
preceding
year
seems
fully
to
have
understood
the
unfavorable
nature
of
the
region
for
manoeuvring
a
large
army
his
adversary
had
however
forced
him
to
accept
battle
leaving
him
no
choice
and
the
result
of
the
actions
of
the
and
had
been
such
as
to
determine
the
federal
commander
to
emerge
as
soon
as
possible
from
the
tangled
underwood
which
hampered
all
his
movements
on
the
he
accordingly
made
no
movement
to
attack
lee
and
on
the
night
of
that
day
marched
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
hanover
junction
following
the
road
by
todd
tavern
toward
spottsylvania
for
this
determination
to
avoid
further
fighting
in
the
wilderness
general
grant
gives
a
singular
explanation
on
the
morning
of
the
he
says
reconnoissance
showed
that
the
enemy
fallen
behind
his
intrenched
with
pickets
to
the
front
covering
a
part
of
the
from
this
it
was
evident
that
the
fighting
had
satisfied
him
of
his
inability
to
further
maintain
the
contest
in
the
open
field
his
advantage
of
and
that
he
would
wait
an
attack
behind
his
works
the
intrenched
lines
and
advantage
of
position
of
lee
were
both
imaginary
no
lines
of
intrenchment
had
been
made
and
the
ground
was
not
more
favorable
on
general
lee
side
than
on
general
grant
both
armies
had
erected
impromptu
breastworks
of
felled
trees
and
earth
as
continued
to
be
their
habit
throughout
the
campaign
and
the
flat
country
gave
no
special
advantage
to
either
the
forward
movement
of
general
grant
is
susceptible
of
much
easier
explanation
the
result
of
the
fighting
had
very
far
from
pleased
him
he
desired
to
avoid
further
conflict
in
so
difficult
a
country
and
taking
advantage
of
the
quiescence
of
lee
and
the
hours
of
darkness
he
moved
with
his
army
toward
the
more
open
country
iv
the
of
may
throughout
the
entire
day
succeeding
this
first
great
conflict
general
lee
remained
quiet
watching
for
some
movement
of
his
adversary
his
success
in
the
preliminary
straggle
had
been
gratifying
considering
the
great
disproportion
of
numbers
but
he
indulged
no
expectation
of
a
retrograde
movement
across
the
rapidan
on
the
part
of
general
grant
he
expected
him
rather
to
advance
and
anxiously
awaited
some
development
of
this
intention
there
were
no
indications
of
such
a
design
up
to
the
night
of
the
but
at
that
time
to
use
the
words
of
a
confidential
member
of
lee
staff
he
all
at
once
seemed
to
conceive
the
idea
that
his
enemy
was
preparing
to
forsake
his
position
and
move
toward
hanover
junction
the
spottsylvania
and
believing
this
he
at
once
detailed
anderson
division
with
orders
to
proceed
rapidly
toward
the
general
anderson
commenced
his
march
about
nine
at
night
when
the
federal
column
was
already
upon
its
way
a
race
now
began
for
the
coveted
position
and
general
stuart
with
his
dismounted
behind
improvised
breastworks
harassed
and
impeded
the
federal
advance
at
every
step
throughout
the
night
this
greatly
delayed
their
march
and
their
head
of
column
did
not
reach
the
vicinity
of
spottsylvania
until
past
sunrise
general
warren
leading
the
federal
advance
then
hurried
forward
followed
by
general
hancock
when
suddenly
he
found
himself
in
front
of
breastworks
and
was
received
with
a
fire
of
musketry
lee
had
succeeded
in
interposing
himself
between
general
grant
and
richmond
on
the
same
evening
the
bulk
of
the
two
armies
were
facing
each
other
on
the
line
of
the
po
by
the
rapidity
of
his
movements
general
lee
had
thus
completely
defeated
his
adversary
design
to
seize
on
the
important
point
spottsylvania
general
grant
apparently
conceiving
some
explanation
of
this
untoward
event
to
be
necessary
writes
the
enemy
having
become
aware
of
our
movement
and
the
shorter
was
enabled
to
reach
there
first
the
statement
that
general
lee
had
the
shorter
of
the
two
lines
to
march
over
is
a
mistake
the
armies
moved
over
parallel
roads
until
beyond
todd
tavern
after
which
the
distance
to
the
south
bank
of
the
po
was
greater
by
route
than
general
grant
the
map
will
sufficiently
indicate
this
two
other
circumstances
defeated
general
grant
attempt
to
reach
the
point
first
the
extreme
rapidity
of
the
march
of
the
confederate
advance
force
and
the
excellent
fighting
of
stuart
dismounted
men
who
harassed
and
delayed
general
warren
leading
the
federal
advance
throughout
the
entire
night
an
additional
fact
should
be
mentioned
bearing
upon
this
point
and
upon
general
lee
designs
general
lee
orders
to
me
says
general
early
who
from
the
sickness
of
hill
had
been
assigned
to
the
command
of
the
corps
were
to
by
todd
tavern
along
the
brock
to
spottsylvania
as
soon
as
our
front
was
clear
of
the
enemy
from
this
order
it
would
appear
either
that
general
lee
regarded
the
brock
road
over
which
general
grant
moved
as
the
shorter
line
or
that
he
intended
the
movement
of
early
on
the
enemy
rear
to
operate
as
a
check
upon
them
while
he
went
forward
to
their
front
with
his
main
body
these
comments
may
seem
tedious
to
the
general
reader
but
all
that
illustrates
the
military
designs
or
defends
the
good
soldiership
of
lee
is
worthy
of
record
we
proceed
now
to
the
narrative
in
the
wilderness
general
grant
had
found
a
dangerous
enemy
ready
to
strike
at
his
flank
he
now
saw
in
his
front
the
same
active
and
wary
adversary
prepared
to
bar
the
direct
road
to
richmond
general
lee
had
taken
up
his
position
on
the
south
bank
of
one
of
the
four
tributaries
of
the
mattapony
these
four
streams
are
known
as
the
mat
ta
po
and
nye
rivers
and
bear
the
same
relation
to
the
main
stream
that
the
fingers
of
the
open
hand
do
to
the
wrist
general
lee
was
behind
the
po
which
is
next
to
the
nye
the
northernmost
of
these
both
were
difficult
to
cross
and
their
banks
heavily
wooded
it
was
now
to
be
seen
whether
either
by
a
front
attack
or
a
turning
movement
general
grant
could
oust
his
adversary
and
whether
general
lee
would
stand
on
the
defensive
or
attack
all
day
during
the
the
two
armies
were
constructing
breastworks
along
their
entire
fronts
and
these
works
from
the
rapidan
to
the
banks
of
the
chickahominy
remain
yet
in
existence
on
the
evening
of
this
day
a
federal
force
was
thrown
across
the
po
on
the
confederate
left
but
soon
withdrawn
and
on
the
a
similar
movement
took
place
near
the
same
point
which
resulted
in
a
brief
but
bloody
conflict
during
which
the
woods
took
fire
and
many
of
the
assaulting
troops
perished
miserably
in
the
flames
the
force
was
then
recalled
and
during
that
night
and
the
succeeding
day
nothing
of
importance
occurred
although
heavy
skirmishing
and
an
took
place
along
the
lines
on
the
morning
of
the
at
the
first
dawn
of
day
general
grant
made
a
more
important
and
dangerous
assault
than
any
yet
undertaken
in
the
campaign
this
was
directed
at
a
salient
on
general
lee
right
centre
occupied
by
johnson
division
of
ewell
corps
and
was
one
of
the
bloodiest
and
most
terrible
incidents
of
the
war
for
this
assault
general
grant
is
said
to
have
selected
his
best
troops
these
advanced
in
a
heavy
charging
column
through
the
half
darkness
of
dawn
passed
silently
over
the
confederate
skirmishers
scarcely
firing
a
shot
and
just
as
the
first
streak
of
daylight
touched
the
eastern
woods
burst
upon
the
salient
which
they
stormed
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
in
consequence
of
the
suddenness
of
the
assault
and
the
absence
of
artillery
against
whose
removal
general
johnston
is
stated
to
have
protested
and
which
arrived
too
late
the
federal
forces
carried
all
before
them
and
gained
possession
of
the
works
in
spite
of
a
stubborn
and
bloody
resistance
such
was
the
excellent
success
of
the
federal
movement
and
the
southern
line
seemed
to
be
hopelessly
disrupted
nearly
the
whole
of
johnson
division
were
taken
prisoners
the
number
amounting
to
about
three
thousand
and
eighteen
pieces
of
artillery
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
assaulting
column
the
position
of
affairs
was
now
exceedingly
critical
and
unless
general
lee
could
reform
his
line
at
the
point
it
seemed
that
nothing
was
left
him
but
an
abandonment
of
his
whole
position
the
federal
army
had
broken
his
line
was
pouring
into
the
opening
and
to
prevent
him
from
concentrating
at
the
point
to
regain
possession
of
the
works
heavy
attacks
were
begun
by
the
enemy
on
his
right
and
left
wings
it
is
probable
that
at
no
time
during
the
war
was
the
southern
army
in
greater
danger
of
a
bloody
and
decisive
disaster
at
this
critical
moment
general
lee
acted
with
the
nerve
and
coolness
of
a
soldier
whom
no
adverse
event
can
shake
those
who
saw
him
will
testify
to
the
stern
courage
of
his
expression
the
glance
of
the
eye
which
indicated
a
great
nature
aroused
to
the
depth
of
its
powerful
organization
line
of
battle
was
promptly
formed
a
short
distance
in
rear
of
the
salient
then
in
the
enemy
possession
and
a
fierce
charge
was
made
by
the
southerners
under
the
eye
of
lee
to
regain
it
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
on
fire
with
the
ardor
of
battle
which
so
seldom
mastered
him
lee
went
forward
in
front
of
his
line
and
taking
his
station
beside
the
colors
of
one
of
his
virginian
regiments
took
off
his
hat
and
turning
to
the
men
pointed
toward
the
enemy
a
storm
of
cheers
greeted
the
general
as
he
sat
his
gray
in
front
of
the
men
his
head
bare
his
eyes
flashing
and
his
cheeks
flushed
with
the
of
the
soldier
general
gordon
however
spurred
to
his
side
and
seized
his
rein
general
lee
he
exclaimed
this
is
no
place
for
you
go
to
the
rear
these
are
virginians
and
georgians
sir
men
who
have
never
failed
men
you
will
not
fail
now
he
cried
rising
in
his
stirrups
and
addressing
the
troops
no
no
was
the
reply
of
the
men
and
from
the
whole
line
burst
the
shout
lee
to
the
rear
lee
to
the
rear
instead
of
being
needed
it
was
obvious
that
his
presence
was
an
embarrassment
as
the
men
seemed
determined
not
to
charge
unless
he
retired
he
accordingly
did
so
and
the
line
advanced
to
the
attack
led
by
general
gordon
and
other
officers
of
approved
ability
and
courage
the
charge
which
followed
was
resolute
and
the
word
ferocious
best
describes
the
struggle
which
followed
it
continued
throughout
the
entire
day
lee
making
not
less
than
five
distinct
assaults
in
heavy
force
to
recover
the
works
the
fight
involved
the
troops
on
both
flanks
and
was
desperate
and
unyielding
the
opposing
flags
were
at
times
within
only
a
few
yards
of
each
other
and
so
incessant
and
concentrated
was
the
fire
of
musketry
that
a
tree
of
about
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
was
cut
down
by
bullets
and
is
still
preserved
it
is
said
in
the
city
of
washington
as
a
memorial
of
this
bloody
struggle
illustration
the
wilderness
lee
to
the
rear
the
fighting
only
ceased
several
hours
after
dark
lee
had
not
regained
his
advanced
line
of
works
but
he
was
firmly
rooted
in
an
interior
and
straighter
line
from
which
the
federal
troops
had
found
it
impossible
to
dislodge
him
this
result
of
the
stubborn
action
was
essentially
a
success
as
general
grant
aim
in
the
operation
had
been
to
break
asunder
his
adversary
army
in
which
he
very
nearly
succeeded
at
midnight
all
was
again
silent
the
ground
near
the
salient
was
strewed
with
dead
bodies
the
loss
of
the
three
thousand
men
and
eighteen
guns
of
johnson
had
been
followed
by
a
bloody
retaliation
the
federal
commander
having
lost
more
than
eight
thousand
men
from
spottsylvania
to
the
chickahominy
after
the
bloody
action
of
the
of
may
general
grant
remained
quiet
for
many
days
awaiting
he
says
the
arrival
of
reënforcements
from
washington
the
number
of
these
fresh
troops
is
not
known
to
the
present
writer
general
lee
had
no
reinforcements
to
expect
and
continued
to
confront
his
adversary
with
his
small
army
which
must
have
been
reduced
by
the
heavy
fighting
to
less
than
forty
thousand
men
while
that
of
general
grant
numbered
probably
about
one
hundred
and
forty
thousand
finding
that
his
opponent
was
not
disposed
to
renew
hostilities
general
lee
on
the
of
may
sent
general
ewell
to
turn
his
right
flank
but
this
movement
resulted
in
nothing
save
the
discovery
by
general
ewell
that
the
federal
army
was
moving
this
intelligence
was
dispatched
to
general
lee
on
the
evening
of
the
and
reached
him
at
souther
house
on
the
banks
of
the
po
where
he
was
calmly
reconnoitring
the
position
of
the
enemy
as
soon
as
he
read
the
note
of
general
ewell
he
mounted
his
horse
saying
in
his
grave
voice
to
his
staff
come
gentlemen
and
orders
were
sent
to
the
army
to
prepare
to
move
the
troops
began
their
march
on
the
same
night
in
the
direction
of
hanover
junction
which
they
reached
on
the
evening
of
the
when
on
may
general
grant
reached
the
banks
of
the
north
anna
he
found
lee
stationed
on
the
south
bank
ready
to
oppose
his
crossing
the
failure
of
general
grant
to
reach
and
seize
upon
the
important
point
of
hanover
junction
before
the
arrival
of
lee
decided
the
fate
of
the
plan
of
campaign
originally
devised
by
him
if
the
reader
will
glance
at
the
map
of
virginia
this
fact
will
become
apparent
hanover
junction
is
the
point
where
the
virginia
central
and
richmond
and
fredericksburg
railroads
cross
each
other
and
is
situated
in
the
angle
of
the
north
anna
and
south
anna
rivers
which
unite
a
short
distance
below
to
form
the
pamunkey
once
in
possession
of
this
point
general
grant
would
have
had
easy
communication
with
the
excellent
base
of
supplies
at
aquia
creek
would
have
cut
the
virginia
central
railroad
and
a
direct
march
southward
would
have
enabled
him
to
invest
richmond
from
the
north
and
northwest
in
accordance
with
his
original
plan
lee
had
however
reached
the
point
first
and
from
that
moment
unless
the
southern
force
were
driven
from
its
position
the
entire
plan
of
campaign
must
necessarily
be
changed
the
great
error
of
general
grant
in
this
arduous
campaign
would
seem
to
have
been
the
feebleness
of
the
attack
which
he
here
made
upon
lee
the
position
of
the
southern
army
was
not
formidable
and
on
his
arrival
they
had
had
no
time
to
erect
defences
the
river
is
not
difficult
of
crossing
and
the
ground
on
the
south
bank
gives
no
decided
advantage
to
a
force
occupying
it
in
spite
of
these
facts
which
it
is
proper
to
say
general
grant
denies
however
nothing
was
effected
and
but
little
attempted
a
few
words
will
sum
up
the
operations
of
the
armies
during
the
two
or
three
days
reaching
the
river
general
grant
threw
a
column
across
some
miles
up
the
stream
at
a
point
known
as
jericho
ford
where
a
brief
but
obstinate
encounter
ensued
between
generals
hill
and
warren
and
this
was
followed
by
the
capture
of
an
old
redoubt
defending
the
chesterfield
bridge
near
the
railroad
crossing
opposite
lee
right
which
enabled
another
column
to
pass
the
stream
at
that
point
these
two
successful
passages
of
the
river
on
lee
left
and
right
seemed
to
indicate
a
fixed
intention
on
the
part
of
his
adversary
to
press
both
the
southern
flanks
and
bring
on
a
decisive
engagement
and
to
coöperate
in
this
plan
a
third
column
was
now
thrown
over
opposite
lee
centre
these
movements
were
however
promptly
met
lee
retired
his
two
wings
but
struck
suddenly
with
his
centre
at
the
force
attempting
to
cross
there
and
then
active
operations
on
both
sides
ceased
in
spite
of
having
passed
the
river
with
the
bulk
of
his
army
and
formed
line
of
battle
general
grant
resolved
not
to
attack
his
explanation
of
this
is
that
lee
position
was
found
stronger
than
either
of
his
previous
ones
such
was
the
result
of
the
able
disposition
of
the
southern
force
at
this
important
point
general
grant
found
his
whole
programme
reversed
and
on
the
night
of
the
silently
withdrew
and
hastened
down
the
north
bank
of
the
pamunkey
toward
hanovertown
preceded
by
the
cavalry
of
general
sheridan
that
officer
had
been
detached
from
the
army
as
it
approached
spottsylvania
to
make
a
rapid
march
toward
richmond
and
destroy
the
confederate
communications
in
this
he
partially
succeeded
but
attempting
to
ride
into
richmond
was
repulsed
with
considerable
loss
the
only
important
result
indeed
of
the
expedition
was
the
death
of
general
stuart
this
distinguished
commander
of
general
lee
cavalry
had
been
directed
to
pursue
general
sheridan
had
done
so
with
his
customary
promptness
and
intercepted
his
column
near
richmond
at
a
spot
known
as
the
yellow
tavern
and
here
in
a
stubborn
engagement
in
which
stuart
strove
to
supply
his
want
of
troops
by
the
fury
of
his
attack
the
great
chief
of
cavalry
was
mortally
wounded
and
expired
soon
afterward
his
fall
was
a
grievous
blow
to
general
lee
heart
as
well
as
to
the
southern
cause
endowed
by
nature
with
a
courage
which
shrunk
from
nothing
active
energetic
of
immense
physical
stamina
which
enabled
him
to
endure
any
amount
of
fatigue
devoted
heart
and
soul
to
the
cause
in
which
he
fought
and
looking
up
to
the
commander
of
the
army
with
childlike
love
and
admiration
stuart
could
be
ill
spared
at
this
critical
moment
and
general
lee
was
plunged
into
the
deepest
melancholy
at
the
intelligence
of
his
death
when
it
reached
him
he
retired
from
those
around
him
and
remained
for
some
time
communing
with
his
own
heart
and
memory
when
one
of
his
staff
entered
and
spoke
of
stuart
general
lee
said
in
a
low
voice
i
can
scarcely
think
of
him
without
weeping
the
command
of
the
cavalry
devolved
upon
general
hampton
and
it
was
fought
throughout
the
succeeding
campaign
with
the
nerve
and
efficiency
of
a
great
soldier
but
stuart
had
as
it
were
formed
and
moulded
it
with
his
own
hands
he
was
the
first
great
commander
of
horse
in
the
war
and
it
was
hard
for
his
successors
however
great
their
genius
to
compete
with
his
memory
his
name
will
thus
remain
that
of
the
greatest
and
most
prominent
of
the
war
crossing
the
pamunkey
at
hanovertown
after
a
rapid
general
grant
sent
out
a
force
toward
hanover
to
cut
off
lee
retreat
or
discover
his
position
this
resulted
in
nothing
since
general
lee
had
not
moved
in
that
direction
he
had
as
soon
as
the
movement
of
general
grant
was
discovered
put
his
lines
in
motion
directed
his
march
across
the
country
on
the
direct
route
to
cold
harbor
and
halting
behind
the
tottapotomoi
had
formed
his
line
there
to
check
the
progress
of
his
adversary
on
the
main
road
from
hanovertown
toward
richmond
for
the
third
time
thus
general
grant
had
found
his
adversary
in
his
path
and
no
generalship
or
rapidity
in
the
movement
of
his
column
seemed
sufficient
to
secure
to
him
the
advantages
of
a
surprise
on
each
occasion
the
march
of
the
federal
army
had
taken
place
in
the
night
from
the
wilderness
on
the
night
of
may
from
spottsylvania
on
the
night
of
may
and
from
near
the
north
anna
on
the
night
of
may
lee
had
imitated
these
movements
of
his
opponent
interposing
on
each
occasion
at
the
critical
moment
in
his
path
and
inviting
battle
this
last
statement
may
be
regarded
as
too
strongly
expressed
as
it
seems
the
opinion
of
northern
writers
that
lee
in
these
movements
aimed
only
to
maintain
a
strict
defensive
and
by
means
of
breastworks
simply
keep
his
adversary
at
arm
length
this
is
an
entire
mistake
confident
of
the
efficiency
of
his
army
small
as
it
was
he
was
always
desirous
to
bring
on
a
decisive
action
under
favorable
circumstances
general
early
bears
his
testimony
to
the
truth
of
this
statement
i
happen
to
know
says
this
officer
that
general
lee
had
always
the
greatest
anxiety
to
strike
at
grant
in
the
open
field
during
the
whole
movement
from
the
wilderness
to
cold
harbor
the
confederate
commander
was
in
excellent
spirits
when
at
hanover
junction
he
spoke
of
the
situation
almost
jocosely
and
said
to
the
venerable
gwathmey
speaking
of
general
grant
if
i
can
get
one
more
pull
at
him
i
will
defeat
him
this
expression
does
not
seem
to
indicate
any
depression
or
want
of
confidence
in
his
ability
to
meet
general
grant
in
an
open
pitched
battle
it
may
however
be
asked
why
if
such
were
his
desire
he
did
not
come
out
from
behind
his
breastworks
and
fight
the
reply
is
that
general
grant
invariably
defended
his
lines
by
breastworks
as
powerful
as
in
many
cases
much
more
powerful
than
his
adversary
the
opposing
mounds
of
earth
and
trees
along
the
routes
of
the
two
armies
remain
to
prove
the
truth
of
what
is
here
stated
at
cold
harbor
especially
the
federal
works
are
veritable
forts
in
face
of
them
the
theory
that
general
grant
uniformly
acted
upon
the
offensive
without
fear
of
offensive
operations
in
turn
on
the
part
of
lee
will
be
found
untenable
nor
is
this
statement
made
with
the
view
of
representing
general
grant
as
or
of
detracting
from
his
merit
as
a
commander
it
was
on
the
contrary
highly
honorable
to
him
that
opposed
to
an
adversary
of
such
ability
he
should
have
neglected
nothing
reaching
the
tottapotomoi
general
grant
found
his
opponent
in
a
strong
position
behind
that
sluggish
prepared
to
dispute
the
road
to
richmond
and
it
now
became
necessary
to
force
the
passage
in
his
front
or
by
another
flank
march
move
still
farther
to
the
left
and
endeavor
to
cross
the
chickahominy
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
cold
harbor
this
last
operation
was
determined
upon
by
general
grant
and
sending
his
cavalry
toward
cold
harbor
he
moved
rapidly
in
the
same
direction
with
his
infantry
this
movement
was
discovered
at
once
by
lee
he
sent
longstreet
corps
forward
and
when
the
federal
army
arrived
the
southern
forces
were
drawn
up
in
their
front
between
them
and
richmond
thus
barring
for
the
fourth
time
in
the
campaign
the
road
to
the
capital
during
these
movements
nearly
continuous
fighting
had
taken
place
between
the
opposing
columns
which
clung
to
each
other
as
it
were
each
shaping
its
march
more
or
less
by
that
of
the
other
at
last
they
had
reached
the
ground
upon
which
the
obstinate
struggle
of
june
had
taken
place
and
it
now
became
necessary
for
general
grant
either
to
form
some
new
plan
of
campaign
or
by
throwing
his
whole
army
in
one
great
mass
against
his
adversary
break
through
all
obstacles
cross
the
chickahominy
and
seize
upon
richmond
this
was
now
resolved
upon
heavy
fighting
took
place
on
june
near
bethesda
church
and
at
other
points
while
the
armies
were
coming
into
position
but
this
was
felt
to
be
but
the
preface
to
the
greater
struggle
which
general
lee
now
clearly
divined
it
came
without
loss
of
time
on
the
morning
of
the
of
june
soon
after
daylight
general
grant
threw
his
whole
army
straightforward
against
lee
front
all
along
his
line
the
conflict
which
followed
was
one
of
those
bloody
grapples
rather
than
battles
which
discarding
all
manoeuvring
or
in
the
commanders
depend
for
the
result
upon
the
brute
strength
of
the
forces
engaged
the
action
did
not
last
half
an
hour
and
in
that
time
the
federal
loss
was
thirteen
thousand
men
when
general
lee
sent
a
messenger
to
hill
asking
the
result
of
the
assault
on
his
part
of
the
line
hill
took
the
officer
with
him
in
front
of
his
works
and
pointing
to
the
dead
bodies
which
were
literally
lying
upon
each
other
said
tell
general
lee
it
is
the
same
all
along
my
front
the
federal
army
had
indeed
sustained
a
blow
so
heavy
that
even
the
constant
mind
and
fixed
resolution
of
general
grant
and
the
federal
authorities
seem
to
have
been
shaken
the
war
seemed
hopeless
to
many
persons
in
the
north
after
the
frightful
bloodshed
of
this
thirty
minutes
at
cold
harbor
of
which
fact
there
is
sufficient
proof
so
gloomy
says
a
northern
historian
was
the
military
outlook
after
the
action
on
the
chickahominy
and
to
such
a
degree
by
consequence
had
the
moral
spring
of
the
public
mind
become
relaxed
that
there
was
at
this
time
great
danger
of
a
collapse
of
the
war
the
history
of
this
conflict
truthfully
written
will
show
this
the
archives
of
the
state
department
when
one
day
made
public
will
show
how
deeply
the
government
was
affected
by
the
want
of
military
success
and
to
what
resolutions
the
executive
had
in
consequence
come
had
not
success
elsewhere
come
to
brighten
the
horizon
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
have
raised
new
forces
to
recruit
the
army
of
the
potomac
which
shaken
in
its
structure
its
valor
quenched
in
blood
and
thousands
of
its
ablest
officers
killed
and
wounded
was
the
army
of
the
potomac
no
more
footnote
swinton
in
his
able
and
candid
campaigns
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
the
campaign
of
one
month
from
may
to
june
had
cost
the
federal
commander
sixty
thousand
men
and
three
thousand
officers
numbers
which
are
given
on
the
authority
of
federal
historians
while
the
loss
of
lee
did
not
exceed
eighteen
thousand
the
result
would
seem
an
unfavorable
comment
upon
the
choice
of
the
route
across
the
country
from
culpepper
instead
of
that
by
the
james
general
mcclellan
two
years
before
had
reached
cold
harbor
with
trifling
losses
to
attain
the
same
point
had
cost
general
grant
a
frightful
number
of
lives
nor
could
it
be
said
that
he
had
any
important
successes
to
offset
this
loss
he
had
not
defeated
his
adversary
in
any
of
the
of
the
campaign
nor
did
it
seem
that
he
had
stricken
him
any
serious
blow
the
army
of
northern
virginia
not
reënforced
until
it
reached
hanover
junction
and
then
only
by
about
nine
thousand
men
under
generals
breckinridge
and
pickett
had
held
its
ground
against
the
large
force
opposed
to
it
had
repulsed
every
assault
and
in
a
final
trial
of
strength
with
a
force
largely
its
superior
had
inflicted
upon
the
enemy
in
about
an
hour
a
loss
of
thirteen
thousand
men
these
facts
highly
honorable
to
lee
and
his
troops
are
the
plainest
and
most
compendious
comment
we
can
make
upon
the
campaign
the
whole
movement
of
general
grant
across
virginia
is
indeed
now
conceded
even
by
his
admirers
to
have
been
unfortunate
it
failed
to
accomplish
the
end
expected
from
it
the
investment
of
richmond
on
the
north
and
west
and
the
lives
of
about
sixty
thousand
men
were
it
would
seem
unnecessarily
lost
to
reach
a
position
which
might
have
been
attained
with
losses
comparatively
trifling
and
without
the
unfortunate
prestige
of
defeat
vi
first
battles
at
petersburg
general
lee
remained
facing
his
adversary
in
his
lines
at
cold
harbor
for
many
days
after
the
bloody
struggle
of
the
of
june
confident
of
his
ability
to
repulse
any
new
attack
and
completely
barring
the
way
to
richmond
the
federal
campaign
it
was
now
seen
was
at
an
end
on
that
line
and
it
was
obvious
that
general
grant
must
adopt
some
other
plan
in
spite
of
his
determination
expressed
in
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
to
fight
it
out
on
that
line
if
it
took
all
the
summer
the
summer
was
but
begun
and
further
fighting
on
that
line
was
hopeless
under
these
circumstances
the
federal
commander
resolved
to
give
up
the
attempt
to
assail
richmond
from
the
north
or
east
and
by
a
rapid
movement
to
petersburg
seize
upon
that
place
cut
the
confederate
railroads
leading
southward
and
thus
compel
an
evacuation
of
the
capital
illustration
map
of
petersburg
and
environs
it
would
be
interesting
to
inquire
what
the
course
of
general
lee
would
have
been
in
the
event
of
the
success
of
this
plan
and
how
the
war
would
have
resulted
it
would
seem
that
under
such
circumstances
his
only
resource
would
have
been
to
retire
with
his
army
in
the
direction
of
lynchburg
where
his
communications
would
have
remained
open
with
the
south
and
west
if
driven
from
that
point
the
fastnesses
of
the
alleghanies
were
at
hand
and
contemplating
afterward
the
possibility
of
being
forced
to
take
refuge
there
he
said
with
my
army
in
the
mountains
of
virginia
i
could
carry
on
this
war
for
twenty
years
longer
that
spectacle
was
lost
to
the
world
lee
and
his
army
fighting
from
mountain
fastness
to
mountain
fastness
and
the
annals
of
war
are
not
illustrated
by
a
chapter
so
strange
that
lee
was
confident
of
his
ability
to
carry
on
such
a
struggle
successfully
is
certain
and
washington
had
conceived
the
same
idea
in
the
old
revolution
when
he
said
that
if
he
were
driven
from
the
seaboard
he
would
take
refuge
in
west
augusta
and
thereby
prolong
the
war
interminably
to
return
from
these
speculations
to
the
narrative
of
events
general
grant
remained
in
front
of
lee
until
the
of
june
when
moving
again
by
his
left
flank
he
crossed
the
chickahominy
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
city
point
at
which
place
the
appomattox
and
james
rivers
mingle
their
waters
and
crossing
the
james
on
pontoons
hastened
forward
in
order
to
seize
upon
petersburg
this
important
undertaking
had
been
strangely
neglected
by
butler
who
in
obedience
to
general
grant
orders
had
sailed
from
fortress
monroe
on
the
of
may
reached
bermuda
hundred
the
peninsula
opposite
city
point
made
by
a
remarkable
bend
in
james
river
and
proceeded
to
intrench
himself
it
was
in
his
power
on
his
arrival
to
have
seized
upon
petersburg
but
this
he
failed
to
do
at
that
time
and
the
appearance
of
a
force
under
general
beauregard
from
the
south
soon
induced
him
to
give
his
entire
attention
to
his
own
safety
an
attack
by
beauregard
had
been
promptly
made
which
nearly
resulted
in
general
butler
destruction
he
succeeded
however
in
retiring
behind
his
works
across
the
neck
of
the
peninsula
in
which
he
now
found
himself
completely
shut
up
and
so
powerless
was
his
situation
with
his
large
force
of
thirty
thousand
men
that
general
grant
wrote
his
army
was
as
completely
shut
off
as
if
it
had
been
in
a
bottle
strongly
corked
the
attempt
of
general
grant
to
seize
upon
petersburg
by
a
surprise
failed
his
forces
were
not
able
to
reach
the
vicinity
of
the
place
until
the
when
they
were
bravely
opposed
behind
impromptu
works
by
a
body
of
local
troops
who
fought
like
regular
soldiers
and
succeeded
in
holding
the
works
until
night
ended
the
contest
when
morning
came
long
lines
were
seen
defiling
into
the
breastworks
and
the
familiar
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
rose
above
the
long
line
of
bayonets
giving
assurance
that
the
possession
of
petersburg
would
be
obstinately
disputed
general
lee
had
moved
with
his
accustomed
celerity
and
as
usual
without
that
loss
of
time
which
results
from
doubt
of
an
intentions
if
general
grant
retired
without
another
battle
on
the
chickahominy
it
was
obvious
to
lee
that
he
must
design
one
of
two
things
either
to
advance
upon
richmond
from
the
direction
of
charles
city
or
attempt
a
campaign
against
the
capital
from
the
south
of
james
river
lee
seems
at
once
to
have
satisfied
himself
that
the
latter
was
the
design
an
inconsiderable
force
was
sent
to
feel
the
enemy
near
the
swamp
he
was
encountered
there
in
some
force
but
satisfied
that
this
was
a
feint
to
mislead
him
general
lee
proceeded
to
cross
the
james
river
above
drury
bluff
near
wilton
and
concentrate
his
army
at
petersburg
on
the
he
was
in
face
of
his
adversary
there
general
grant
had
adopted
the
plan
of
campaign
which
lee
expected
him
to
adopt
general
mcclellan
had
not
been
permitted
in
to
carry
out
the
same
plan
it
was
now
undertaken
by
general
grant
who
sustained
better
relations
toward
the
government
and
the
result
would
seem
to
indicate
that
general
mcclellan
was
after
all
a
soldier
of
sound
views
as
soon
as
general
lee
reached
petersburg
he
began
promptly
to
draw
a
regular
line
of
earthworks
around
the
city
to
the
east
and
south
for
its
defence
it
was
obvious
that
general
grant
would
lose
no
time
in
striking
at
him
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
slight
character
of
the
defences
already
existing
and
this
anticipation
was
speedily
realized
general
lee
had
scarcely
gotten
his
forces
in
position
on
the
when
he
was
furiously
attacked
and
such
was
the
weight
of
this
assault
that
lee
was
forced
from
his
advanced
position
east
of
the
city
behind
his
second
line
of
works
by
this
time
well
forward
in
process
of
construction
against
this
new
line
general
grant
threw
heavy
forces
in
attack
after
attack
on
the
and
losing
it
is
said
more
than
four
thousand
men
but
effecting
nothing
on
the
general
lee
was
called
upon
to
meet
a
more
formidable
assault
than
any
of
the
preceding
ones
this
time
more
to
his
right
in
the
vicinity
of
the
weldon
railroad
which
runs
southward
from
petersburg
a
heavy
line
was
advanced
in
that
quarter
by
the
enemy
but
observing
that
an
interval
had
been
left
between
two
of
their
corps
general
lee
threw
forward
a
column
under
general
hill
cut
the
federal
lines
and
repulsed
their
attack
bearing
off
nearly
three
thousand
prisoners
on
the
same
night
an
important
cavalry
expedition
consisting
of
the
divisions
of
general
wilson
and
kautz
numbering
about
six
thousand
horse
was
sent
westward
to
cut
the
weldon
southside
and
danville
railroads
which
connected
the
southern
army
with
the
south
and
west
this
raid
resulted
in
apparently
great
but
really
unimportant
injury
to
the
confederate
communications
against
which
it
was
directed
the
federal
cavalry
tore
up
large
portions
of
the
tracks
of
all
three
railroads
burning
the
and
laying
waste
the
country
around
but
the
further
results
of
the
expedition
were
unfavorable
they
were
pursued
and
harassed
by
a
small
body
of
cavalry
under
general
lee
and
on
their
return
in
the
direction
of
reams
station
were
met
near
sapponey
church
by
a
force
of
fifteen
hundred
cavalry
under
general
hampton
that
energetic
officer
at
once
attacked
the
fighting
continued
furiously
throughout
the
entire
night
and
at
dawn
the
federal
horse
retreated
in
confusion
their
misfortunes
were
not
however
ended
near
reams
at
which
point
they
attempted
to
cross
the
weldon
railroad
they
were
met
by
general
fitz
lee
horsemen
and
about
two
hundred
infantry
under
general
mahone
and
this
force
completed
their
discomfiture
after
a
brief
attempt
to
force
their
way
through
the
unforeseen
obstacle
they
broke
in
disorder
leaving
behind
them
twelve
pieces
of
artillery
and
more
than
a
thousand
prisoners
and
with
foaming
and
exhausted
horses
regained
the
federal
lines
such
was
the
result
of
an
expedition
from
which
general
grant
probably
expected
much
the
damage
done
to
lee
communications
was
inconsiderable
and
did
not
repay
the
federal
commander
for
the
losses
sustained
the
railroads
were
soon
repaired
and
in
working
order
again
and
the
federal
cavalry
was
for
the
time
rendered
unfit
for
further
operations
it
was
now
the
end
of
june
and
every
attempt
made
by
general
grant
to
force
lee
lines
had
proved
unsuccessful
it
was
apparent
that
surprise
of
the
able
commander
of
the
confederate
army
was
hopeless
his
works
were
growing
stronger
every
day
and
nothing
was
left
to
his
great
adversary
but
to
lay
regular
siege
to
the
long
line
of
fortifications
to
draw
lines
for
the
protection
of
his
own
front
from
attack
and
by
gradually
extending
his
left
reach
out
toward
the
weldon
and
southside
railroads
to
obtain
possession
of
these
roads
was
from
this
time
general
great
object
and
all
his
movements
were
shaped
by
that
paramount
consideration
vii
the
siege
of
richmond
begun
the
first
days
of
july
witnessed
at
petersburg
the
commencement
of
a
series
of
military
manoeuvres
for
which
few
if
any
precedents
existed
in
all
the
annals
of
war
an
army
of
forty
or
fifty
thousand
men
intrenched
along
a
line
extending
finally
over
a
distance
of
nearly
forty
miles
was
defending
against
a
force
of
about
thrice
its
numbers
a
capital
more
than
twenty
miles
in
its
rear
and
from
july
of
one
year
to
april
of
the
next
there
never
was
a
moment
when
to
have
broken
through
this
line
would
not
have
terminated
the
war
and
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
the
confederacy
a
few
words
in
reference
to
the
topography
of
the
country
and
the
situation
will
show
this
petersburg
is
miles
south
of
richmond
and
is
connected
with
the
south
and
west
by
the
weldon
and
southside
railroads
which
latter
road
crosses
the
danville
railroad
the
main
line
of
communication
between
the
capital
and
the
gulf
states
with
the
enemy
once
holding
these
roads
and
those
north
of
the
city
as
they
were
preparing
to
do
the
capital
would
be
isolated
and
the
confederate
government
must
evacuate
virginia
in
that
event
the
army
of
northern
virginia
had
also
nothing
left
to
it
but
retreat
virginia
must
be
abandoned
the
federal
authority
would
be
extended
over
the
oldest
and
one
of
the
largest
and
most
important
members
of
the
confederacy
and
under
circumstances
so
adverse
it
might
well
be
a
question
whether
disheartened
as
they
would
be
by
the
loss
of
so
powerful
an
ally
the
other
states
of
the
confederacy
would
have
sufficient
resolution
to
continue
the
contest
these
considerations
are
said
to
have
been
fully
weighed
by
general
lee
whose
military
sagacity
divined
the
exact
situation
of
affairs
and
the
probable
results
of
a
conflict
so
unequal
as
that
which
general
grant
now
forced
upon
him
we
have
noticed
on
a
preceding
page
his
opinions
upon
this
subject
expressed
to
a
confidential
friend
as
far
back
as
he
then
declared
that
the
true
line
of
assault
upon
richmond
was
that
now
adopted
by
general
grant
as
long
as
the
capital
was
assailed
from
the
north
or
the
east
he
might
hope
with
some
reason
by
hard
fighting
to
repulse
the
assault
and
hold
richmond
but
with
an
enemy
at
petersburg
threatening
with
a
large
force
the
southern
railroads
it
was
obviously
only
a
question
of
time
when
richmond
and
consequently
virginia
must
be
abandoned
general
lee
we
repeat
fully
realized
the
facts
here
stated
when
his
adversary
giving
up
all
other
lines
crossed
james
river
to
petersburg
lee
is
said
we
know
not
with
what
truth
to
have
coolly
recommended
an
evacuation
of
richmond
but
this
met
with
no
favor
a
powerful
party
including
both
the
friends
and
enemies
of
the
executive
spoke
of
the
movement
as
a
pernicious
idea
if
recommended
by
lee
it
was
speedily
abandoned
and
all
the
energies
of
the
government
were
concentrated
upon
the
difficult
task
of
holding
the
enemy
at
arm
length
south
of
the
appomattox
and
in
charles
city
in
a
few
weeks
after
the
appearance
of
the
adversaries
opposite
each
other
at
petersburg
the
lines
of
leaguer
and
defence
were
drawn
and
the
long
struggle
began
general
grant
had
crossed
a
force
into
charles
city
on
the
north
bank
of
james
river
and
thus
menaced
richmond
with
an
assault
from
that
quarter
his
line
extended
thence
across
the
neck
of
the
peninsula
of
bermuda
hundred
and
east
and
south
of
petersburg
where
day
by
day
it
gradually
reached
westward
approaching
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
railroads
feeding
the
southern
army
and
capital
lee
line
conformed
itself
to
that
of
his
adversary
in
addition
to
the
works
east
and
southeast
of
richmond
an
exterior
chain
of
defences
had
been
drawn
facing
the
hostile
force
near
deep
bottom
and
the
river
at
drury
bluff
a
fortification
of
some
strength
had
been
guarded
by
sunken
obstructions
against
the
approach
of
the
federal
gunboats
the
southern
lines
then
continued
facing
those
of
the
enemy
north
of
the
appomattox
and
crossing
that
stream
extended
around
the
city
of
petersburg
gradually
moving
westward
in
conformity
with
the
works
of
general
grant
a
glance
at
the
accompanying
diagram
will
clearly
indicate
the
positions
and
relations
to
each
other
of
the
federal
and
confederate
works
these
will
show
that
the
real
struggle
was
anticipated
by
both
commanders
west
of
petersburg
and
as
the
days
wore
on
it
was
more
and
more
apparent
that
somewhere
in
the
vicinity
of
dinwiddie
the
last
great
wrestle
of
the
opposing
armies
must
take
place
to
that
conclusive
trial
of
strength
we
shall
advance
with
as
few
interruptions
as
possible
the
operations
of
the
two
armies
at
petersburg
do
not
possess
for
the
general
reader
that
dramatic
interest
which
is
found
in
battles
such
as
those
of
chancellorsville
and
gettysburg
deciding
for
the
time
the
fates
of
great
campaigns
at
petersburg
the
fighting
seemed
to
decide
little
and
the
bloody
collisions
had
no
names
the
day
of
pitched
battles
indeed
seemed
past
it
was
one
long
battle
day
and
night
week
after
week
and
month
after
month
during
the
heat
of
summer
the
sad
hours
of
autumn
and
the
cold
days
and
nights
of
winter
it
was
in
fact
the
siege
of
richmond
which
general
grant
had
undertaken
and
the
fighting
consisted
less
of
battles
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
that
word
than
of
attempts
to
break
through
the
lines
of
his
adversary
now
north
of
james
river
now
east
of
petersburg
now
at
some
point
in
the
long
chain
of
redans
which
guarded
the
approaches
to
the
coveted
southside
railroad
which
once
in
possession
of
the
federal
commander
would
give
him
victory
of
this
long
obstinate
and
bloody
struggle
we
shall
describe
only
those
prominent
incidents
which
rose
above
the
rest
with
a
species
of
dramatic
splendor
for
the
full
narrative
the
reader
must
have
recourse
to
military
histories
aiming
to
chronicle
the
operations
of
each
corps
division
and
brigade
in
the
two
armies

viii
lee
threatens
washington
the
month
of
july
began
and
went
upon
its
way
with
incessant
fighting
all
along
the
confederate
front
both
north
of
james
river
and
south
of
the
appomattox
general
grant
was
thus
engaged
in
the
persistent
effort
to
at
some
point
break
through
his
opponent
works
when
intelligence
suddenly
reached
him
by
telegraph
from
washington
that
a
strong
confederate
column
had
advanced
down
the
shenandoah
valley
crossed
the
potomac
and
was
rapidly
moving
eastward
in
the
direction
of
the
federal
capital
this
portentous
incident
was
the
result
of
a
plan
of
great
boldness
devised
by
general
lee
from
which
he
expected
much
a
few
words
will
explain
this
plan
a
portion
of
general
grant
plan
of
campaign
had
been
an
advance
up
the
valley
and
another
from
western
virginia
toward
the
lynchburg
and
tennessee
railroad
the
two
columns
to
coöperate
with
the
main
army
by
cutting
the
confederate
communications
the
column
in
western
virginia
effected
little
but
that
in
the
valley
under
general
hunter
hastened
forward
almost
unopposed
from
the
small
numbers
of
the
southern
force
and
early
in
june
threatened
lynchburg
the
news
reached
lee
at
cold
harbor
soon
after
his
battle
there
with
general
grant
and
he
promptly
detached
general
early
at
the
head
of
about
eight
thousand
men
with
orders
to
move
to
the
valley
through
gap
or
brown
gap
attack
hunter
and
then
cross
the
potomac
and
threaten
washington
footnote
this
statement
of
his
orders
was
derived
from
early
general
early
an
officer
of
great
energy
and
intrepidity
moved
without
loss
of
time
and
an
engagement
ensued
between
him
and
general
hunter
near
lynchburg
the
battle
was
soon
decided
general
hunter
who
had
more
cruelly
oppressed
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
than
even
general
milroy
was
completely
defeated
driven
in
disordered
flight
toward
the
ohio
and
early
hastened
down
the
valley
and
thence
into
maryland
with
the
view
of
threatening
washington
as
he
had
been
ordered
to
do
by
lee
his
march
was
exceedingly
rapid
and
he
found
the
road
unobstructed
until
he
reached
the
monocacy
near
frederick
city
where
he
was
opposed
by
a
force
under
general
wallace
this
force
he
attacked
and
soon
drove
from
the
field
he
then
pressed
forward
and
on
the
of
july
came
in
sight
of
washington
it
was
the
intelligence
of
this
advance
of
a
confederate
force
into
maryland
and
toward
the
capital
which
came
to
startle
general
grant
while
he
was
hotly
engaged
with
lee
at
petersburg
the
washington
authorities
seem
to
have
been
completely
unnerved
and
to
have
regarded
the
capture
of
the
city
as
nearly
inevitable
general
grant
however
stood
firm
and
did
not
permit
the
terror
of
the
civil
authorities
to
affect
him
he
sent
forward
to
washington
two
army
corps
and
these
arrived
just
in
time
if
it
had
been
in
the
power
of
general
early
to
capture
washington
which
seems
questionable
the
opportunity
was
lost
he
found
himself
compelled
to
retire
across
the
potomac
again
to
avoid
an
attack
in
his
rear
and
this
he
effected
without
loss
taking
up
in
accordance
with
orders
from
lee
a
position
in
the
valley
where
he
remained
for
some
months
a
standing
threat
to
the
enemy
such
was
the
famous
march
of
general
early
to
washington
and
there
seems
at
present
little
reason
to
doubt
that
the
federal
capital
had
a
narrow
escape
from
capture
by
the
confederates
what
the
result
of
so
singular
an
event
would
have
been
it
is
difficult
to
say
but
it
is
certain
that
it
would
have
put
an
end
to
general
grant
entire
campaign
at
petersburg
then
but
speculations
of
this
character
are
simply
loss
of
time
the
city
was
not
captured
the
war
went
upon
its
way
and
was
destined
to
terminate
by
pure
exhaustion
of
one
of
the
combatants
unaffected
by
de
in
any
part
of
the
theatre
of
conflict
we
have
briefly
spoken
of
the
engagement
between
generals
early
and
hunter
near
lynchburg
and
the
abrupt
retreat
of
the
latter
to
the
western
mountains
and
thence
toward
the
ohio
it
may
interest
the
reader
to
know
general
lee
views
on
the
subject
of
this
retreat
which
it
seems
were
drawn
from
him
by
a
letter
addressed
to
him
by
general
hunter
as
soon
after
the
war
as
mail
communications
were
opened
writes
the
gentleman
of
high
character
from
whom
we
derive
this
incident
general
david
hunter
wrote
to
general
lee
begging
that
he
would
answer
him
frankly
on
two
points
his
hunter
campaign
in
was
undertaken
on
information
received
by
general
halleck
that
general
lee
was
about
to
detach
forty
thousand
picked
troops
to
send
to
georgia
did
not
his
hunter
move
prevent
this
when
he
found
it
necessary
to
retreat
from
lynchburg
did
he
not
take
the
most
feasible
route
general
lee
wrote
a
very
courteous
reply
in
which
he
said
general
halleck
was
misinformed
i
had
troops
to
and
forty
thousand
would
have
taken
nearly
my
whole
army
i
am
not
advised
as
to
the
motives
which
induced
you
to
adopt
your
line
of
retreat
and
am
not
perhaps
competent
to
judge
of
the
question
i
certainly
expected
you
to
retreat
by
of
the
shenandoah
valley
general
hunter
adds
our
correspondent
never
published
this
letter
but
i
heard
general
lee
tell
of
it
one
day
with
evident
pleasure
lee
opinion
of
the
military
abilities
of
both
generals
hunter
and
sheridan
was
indeed
far
from
flattering
he
regarded
those
two
commanders
especially
general
sheridan
as
enjoying
reputations
solely
conferred
upon
them
by
the
exhaustion
of
the
resources
of
the
confederacy
and
not
warranted
by
any
military
efficiency
in
themselves
ix
the
mine
explosion
the
end
of
the
month
of
july
was
now
approaching
and
every
attempt
made
by
general
grant
to
break
through
lee
lines
had
resulted
in
failure
at
every
point
which
he
assailed
an
armed
force
sufficient
to
repulse
his
most
vigorous
attacks
seemed
to
spring
from
the
earth
and
no
movement
of
the
federal
forces
however
sudden
and
rapid
had
been
able
to
take
the
confederate
commander
unawares
the
campaign
was
apparently
settling
down
into
stubborn
fighting
day
and
night
in
which
the
object
of
general
grant
was
to
carry
out
his
programme
of
attrition
such
was
the
feeling
in
both
armies
when
at
dawn
on
the
of
july
a
loud
explosion
heard
for
thirty
miles
took
place
on
the
lines
near
petersburg
and
a
vast
column
of
smoke
shooting
upward
to
a
great
height
seemed
to
indicate
the
blowing
up
of
an
extensive
magazine
instead
of
a
magazine
it
was
a
mine
which
had
thus
been
exploded
and
the
incident
was
not
the
least
singular
of
a
campaign
unlike
any
which
had
preceded
it
the
plan
of
forming
a
breach
in
the
southern
works
by
exploding
a
mine
beneath
them
is
said
by
northern
writers
to
have
originated
with
a
subordinate
officer
of
the
federal
army
who
observing
the
close
proximity
of
the
opposing
works
near
petersburg
conceived
it
feasible
to
construct
a
subterranean
gallery
reaching
beneath
those
of
general
lee
the
undertaking
was
begun
the
earth
being
carried
off
in
and
such
was
the
steady
persistence
of
the
workmen
that
a
gallery
five
hundred
feet
long
with
lateral
openings
beneath
the
confederate
works
was
soon
finished
and
in
these
lateral
recesses
was
placed
a
large
amount
of
powder
all
was
now
ready
and
the
question
was
how
to
utilize
the
explosion
general
grant
decided
to
follow
it
by
a
sudden
charge
through
the
breach
seize
a
crest
in
rear
and
thus
interpose
a
force
directly
in
the
centre
of
lee
line
a
singular
discussion
however
arose
and
caused
some
embarrassment
should
the
assaulting
column
consist
of
white
or
negro
troops
this
question
was
decided
general
grant
afterward
declared
by
pulling
straws
or
tossing
coppers
the
white
troops
were
the
fortunate
or
unfortunate
ones
and
on
the
morning
of
july
the
mine
was
exploded
the
effect
was
frightful
and
the
incident
will
long
be
remembered
by
those
present
and
escaping
unharmed
the
small
southern
force
and
artillery
immediately
above
the
mine
were
hurled
into
the
air
an
opening
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
sixty
feet
wide
and
thirty
feet
deep
suddenly
appeared
where
a
moment
before
had
extended
the
confederate
earthworks
and
the
federal
division
selected
for
the
charge
rushed
forward
to
pierce
the
opening
the
result
did
not
justify
the
sanguine
expectations
which
seem
to
have
been
excited
in
the
breasts
of
the
federal
officers
a
southern
writer
thus
describes
what
ensued
the
division
charged
reached
the
crater
stumbled
over
the

suddenly
met
by
a
merciless
fire
of
artillery

and

the
plan
of

of

mingled
with
company
and
upon
this
disordered
unstrung
quivering
mass
of
human
beings
white
and
black
for
the
black
troops
had
followed
was
poured
a
hurricane
of
shot
shell
canister
musketry
which
made
the
hideous
crater
a
horrible
and
frightful
beyond
the
power
of
words
all
order
was
lost
all
idea
of
charging
the
crest
abandoned
lee
infantry
was
seen
concentrating
for
the
carnival
of
death
his
artillery
was
massing
to
destroy
the
remnants
of
the
charging
divisions
those
who
deserted
the
crater
to
scramble
over
the
and
run
back
were
shot
down
then
all
that
was
left
to
the
shuddering
mass
of
blacks
and
whites
in
the
pit
was
to
shrink
lower
evade
the
horrible
and
wait
for
a
charge
of
their
friends
to
rescue
them
or
surrender
these
sentences
sufficiently
describe
the
painful
scene
which
followed
the
explosion
of
the
mine
the
charging
column
was
unable
to
advance
in
face
of
the
very
heavy
fire
directed
upon
them
by
the
southern
infantry
and
artillery
and
the
effect
of
this
fire
was
so
appalling
that
general
mahone
commanding
at
the
spot
is
said
to
have
ordered
it
to
cease
adding
that
the
spectacle
made
him
sick
the
federal
forces
finally
succeeded
in
making
their
way
back
with
a
loss
of
about
four
thousand
prisoners
and
general
lee
whose
losses
had
been
small
reëstablished
his
line
without
interruption
before
passing
from
this
incident
a
singular
circumstance
connected
with
it
is
deserving
of
mention
this
was
the
declaration
of
the
congressional
committee
which
in
due
time
investigated
the
whole
affair
the
conclusion
of
the
committee
was
not
flattering
to
the
veteran
army
of
the
potomac
the
report
declared
that
the
first
and
great
cause
of
disaster
was
the
employment
of
white
instead
of
black
troops
to
make
the
charge
x
end
of
the
campaign
of
throughout
the
months
of
august
and
september
lee
continued
to
be
attacked
at
various
points
along
his
entire
front
but
succeeded
in
repulsing
every
assault
general
grant
design
may
be
said
in
general
terms
to
have
been
a
steady
extension
of
his
left
toward
the
confederate
communications
west
of
petersburg
while
taking
the
chances
by
attacks
north
of
james
river
to
break
through
in
that
quarter
and
seize
upon
richmond
it
is
probable
that
his
hopes
of
effecting
the
object
were
small
but
operations
in
that
direction
promised
the
more
probable
result
of
causing
lee
to
weaken
his
right
and
thus
uncover
the
southside
railroad
an
indecisive
attack
on
the
north
of
james
river
was
followed
toward
the
end
of
august
by
a
heavy
advance
to
seize
upon
the
weldon
railroad
near
petersburg
in
this
general
grant
succeeded
an
event
clearly
foreseen
by
lee
who
had
long
before
informed
the
authorities
that
he
could
not
hold
this
road
general
grant
followed
up
this
success
by
sending
heavy
forces
to
seize
reams
station
on
the
same
road
farther
south
and
afterward
to
destroy
it
to
hicksford
which
however
effected
less
favorable
results
lee
meeting
and
defeating
both
forces
after
obstinate
engagements
in
which
the
federal
troops
lost
heavily
and
were
compelled
to
retreat
these
varying
successes
did
not
however
materially
affect
the
general
result
the
federal
left
gradually
reached
farther
and
farther
westward
until
finally
it
had
passed
the
vaughan
squirrel
level
and
other
roads
running
from
petersburg
and
in
october
was
established
on
the
left
bank
of
hatcher
run
which
unites
with
gravelly
run
to
form
the
rowanty
it
was
now
obvious
that
a
further
extension
of
the
federal
left
would
probably
enable
general
grant
to
seize
upon
the
southside
railroad
an
energetic
attempt
was
speedily
made
by
him
to
effect
this
important
object
to
which
it
is
said
he
attached
great
importance
from
its
anticipated
bearing
on
the
approaching
presidential
election
on
the
of
october
a
heavy
column
was
thrown
across
run
in
the
vicinity
of
burgess
mill
on
the
boydton
road
and
an
obstinate
attack
was
made
on
lee
lines
there
with
the
view
of
breaking
through
to
the
southside
road
in
this
however
general
grant
did
not
succeed
his
column
was
met
in
front
and
flank
by
generals
hampton
who
here
lost
his
brave
son
preston
and
lee
with
dismounted
infantry
was
hastened
to
the
threatened
point
by
general
lee
and
after
an
obstinate
struggle
the
federal
force
was
driven
back
general
lee
reporting
that
general
mahone
charged
and
broke
three
lines
of
battle
footnote
of
lee
it
was
the
habit
of
general
lee
throughout
the
last
campaign
of
the
war
to
send
to
richmond
from
time
to
time
brief
dispatches
announcing
whatever
occurred
along
the
lines
and
these
in
the
absence
of
official
reports
of
these
occurrences
on
the

are
valuable

of
the
progress
of
affairs
these
brief
summaries
are
reliable
from
the
absence
of
all
exaggeration
but
can
not
be
depended
upon
by
the
historian
for
a
very
singular
reason
namely
that
almost

the

are
understated

of
importance
for
the

and
but
one
other
attempt
was
made
during
the
winter
to
gain
ground
on
the
left
this
took
place
early
in
february
and
resulted
in
failure
like
the
former
the
confederates
losing
however
the
brave
general
john
pegram
the
presidential
election
at
the
north
had
been
decided
in
favor
of
lincoln
general
mcclellan
and
pendleton
the
supposed
advocates
of
peace
suffering
defeat
the
significance
of
this
fact
was
unmistakable
it
was
now
seen
that
unless
the
confederates
fought
their
way
to
independence
there
was
no
hope
of
a
favorable
termination
of
the
war
and
this
conclusion
was
courageously
faced
by
general
lee
the
outlook
for
the
coming
year
was
far
from
encouraging
the
resources
of
the
confederacy
were
steadily
being
reduced
her
coasts
were
blockaded
her
armies
were
diminishing
discouragement
seemed
slowly
to
be
invading
every
heart
but
in
the
midst
of
this
general
foreboding
the
commander
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
retained
an
august
composure
and
conversing
with
one
of
the
southern
senators
said
for
myself
i
intend
to
die
sword
in
hand
that
his
sense
of
duty
did
not
afterward
permit
him
to
do
so
was
perhaps
one
of
the
bitterest
pangs
of
his
whole
life
xi
lee
in
the
winter
of
before
entering
upon
the
narrative
of
the
last
and
decisive
campaign
of
the
war
we
shall
speak
of
the
personal
demeanor
of
general
lee
at
this
time
and
endeavor
to
account
for
a
circumstance
which
astonished
many
persons
his
surprising
equanimity
and
even
cheerfulness
under
the
pressure
of
cares
sufficient
it
would
seem
to
crush
the
most
powerful
organization
he
had
established
his
headquarters
a
mile
or
two
west
of
petersburg
on
the
cox
road
nearly
opposite
his
centre
and
here
he
seemed
to
await
whatever
the
future
would
bring
with
a
tranquillity
which
was
a
source
of
surprise
and
admiration
to
all
who
were
thrown
in
contact
with
him
many
persons
will
bear
their
testimony
to
this
extraordinary
composure
his
countenance
seldom
if
ever
exhibited
the
least
traces
of
anxiety
but
was
firm
hopeful
and
encouraged
those
around
him
in
the
belief
that
he
was
still
confident
of
success
that
he
did
not
however
look
forward
with
any
thing
like
hope
to
such
success
we
have
endeavored
already
to
show
from
the
first
he
seems
to
have
regarded
his
situation
unless
his
army
were
largely
reënforced
as
almost
desperate
those
reënforcements
did
not
come
and
yet
as
he
saw
his
numbers
day
by
day
decreasing
and
general
grant
increasing
a
still
larger
ratio
he
retained
his
courage
confronting
the
misfortunes
closing
in
upon
him
with
unmoved
composure
and
at
no
time
seemed
to
lose
his
heart
of
hope
of
this
phenomenon
the
explanation
has
been
sought
in
the
constitutional
courage
of
the
individual
and
that
instinctive
rebound
against
fate
which
takes
place
in
great
organizations
this
explanation
doubtless
is
not
without
a
certain
amount
of
truth
but
an
attentive
consideration
of
the
principles
which
guided
this
eminent
soldier
throughout
his
career
will
show
that
his
equanimity
at
a
moment
so
trying
was
due
to
another
and
more
controlling
sentiment
this
sentiment
was
his
devotion
to
duty
the
sublimest
word
in
our
language
throughout
his
entire
life
he
had
sought
to
discover
and
perform
his
duty
without
regard
to
consequences
that
had
been
with
him
the
great
question
in
april
when
the
war
broke
out
he
had
decided
in
his
own
mind
what
he
ought
to
do
and
had
not
hesitated
from
that
time
forward
he
continued
to
do
what
duty
commanded
without
a
murmur
in
the
obscure
campaign
of
western
virginia
in
the
unnoted
work
of
fortifying
the
southern
coast
in
the
great
campaigns
which
he
had
subsequently
fought
and
everywhere
his
consciousness
of
having
performed
his
duty
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
and
ability
sustained
him
it
sustained
him
above
all
at
gettysburg
where
he
had
done
his
best
giving
him
strength
to
take
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
that
disaster
and
now
in
these
last
dark
days
at
petersburg
it
must
have
been
the
sense
of
having
done
his
whole
duty
and
expended
upon
the
cause
every
energy
of
his
being
which
enabled
him
to
meet
the
approaching
catastrophe
with
a
calmness
which
seemed
to
those
around
him
almost
sublime
if
this
be
not
the
explanation
of
the
composure
of
general
lee
throughout
the
last
great
struggle
with
the
federal
army
the
writer
of
these
pages
is
at
a
loss
to
account
for
it
the
phenomenon
was
plain
to
all
eyes
and
crowned
the
soldier
with
a
glory
greater
than
that
which
he
had
derived
from
his
most
decisive
military
successes
great
and
unmoved
in
the
dark
hour
as
in
the
bright
he
seemed
to
have
determined
to
perform
his
duty
to
the
last
and
to
shape
his
conduct
under
whatever
pressure
of
disaster
upon
the
two
maxims
do
your
duty
and
human
virtue
should
be
equal
to
human
calamity
there
is
little
reason
to
doubt
that
general
lee
saw
this
calamity
coming
for
the
effort
to
reënforce
his
small
army
with
fresh
levies
seemed
hopeless
the
reasons
for
this
unfortunate
state
of
things
must
be
sought
elsewhere
the
unfortunate
fact
will
be
stated
without
comment
that
while
the
federal
army
was
regularly
and
largely
reënforced
so
that
its
numbers
at
no
time
fell
below
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
lee
entire
force
at
petersburg
at
no
time
reached
sixty
thousand
and
in
the
spring
of
when
he
still
continued
to
hold
his
long
line
of
defences
numbered
scarcely
half
of
sixty
thousand
this
was
the
primary
cause
of
the
failure
of
the
struggle
general
grant
immense
hammer
continued
to
beat
upon
his
adversary
wearing
away
his
strength
day
by
day
no
new
troops
arrived
to
take
the
places
of
those
who
had
fallen
and
general
lee
saw
drawing
closer
and
closer
the
inevitable
hour
when
driven
from
his
works
or
with
the
federal
army
upon
his
communications
he
must
cut
his
way
southward
or
surrender
a
last
circumstance
in
reference
to
general
lee
position
at
this
time
should
be
stated
the
fact
that
from
the
autumn
of
to
the
end
in
the
spring
of
he
was
felt
by
the
country
and
the
army
to
be
the
sole
hope
of
the
confederacy
to
him
alone
now
all
men
looked
as
the
ex
to
extricate
them
from
the
dangers
surrounding
them
this
sentiment
needed
no
expression
in
words
it
was
seen
in
the
faces
and
the
very
tones
of
voice
of
all
old
men
visited
him
and
begged
him
with
faltering
voices
not
to
expose
himself
for
if
he
were
killed
all
would
be
lost
the
troops
followed
him
with
their
eyes
or
their
cheers
whenever
he
appeared
feeling
a
singular
sense
of
confidence
from
the
presence
of
the
soldier
in
his
plain
uniform
and
assured
that
as
long
as
lee
led
them
the
cause
was
safe
all
classes
of
the
people
thus
regarded
the
fate
of
the
confederacy
as
resting
not
partially
but
solely
upon
the
shoulders
of
lee
and
although
he
was
not
entitled
by
his
rank
in
the
service
to
direct
operations
in
other
quarters
than
virginia
there
was
a
very
general
desire
that
the
whole
conduct
of
the
war
everywhere
should
be
intrusted
to
his
hands
this
was
done
as
will
be
seen
toward
the
spring
of
but
it
was
too
late
these
notices
of
general
lee
individually
are
necessary
to
a
clear
comprehension
of
the
concluding
incidents
of
the
great
conflict
it
is
doubtful
if
in
any
other
struggle
of
history
the
hopes
of
a
people
were
more
entirely
wrapped
up
in
a
single
individual
all
criticisms
of
the
eminent
soldier
had
long
since
been
silenced
and
it
may
indeed
be
said
that
something
like
a
superstitious
confidence
in
his
fortunes
had
become
widely
disseminated
it
was
the
general
sentiment
even
when
lee
himself
saw
the
end
surely
approaching
that
all
was
safe
while
he
remained
in
command
of
the
army
this
hallucination
must
have
greatly
pained
him
for
no
one
ever
saw
more
clearly
or
was
less
blinded
by
irrational
confidence
lee
fully
understood
and
represented
to
the
civil
authorities
with
whom
his
relations
were
perfectly
friendly
and
cordial
that
if
his
lines
were
broken
at
any
point
the
fate
of
the
campaign
was
sealed
feeling
this
truth
of
which
his
military
sagacity
left
him
in
no
doubt
he
had
to
bear
the
further
weight
of
that
general
confidence
which
he
did
not
share
he
did
not
complain
however
or
in
any
manner
indicate
the
desperate
straits
to
which
he
had
come
he
called
for
fresh
troops
to
supply
his
losses
when
they
did
not
arrive
he
continued
to
oppose
his
powerful
adversary
with
the
remnant
still
at
his
command
these
were
now
more
like
old
comrades
than
mere
private
soldiers
under
his
orders
what
was
left
of
the
army
was
its
best
material
the
fires
of
battle
had
tested
the
metal
and
that
which
emerged
from
the
furnace
was
gold
free
from
alloy
the
men
remaining
with
lee
were
those
whom
no
peril
of
the
cause
in
which
they
were
fighting
could
dishearten
or
prompt
to
desert
or
even
temporarily
absent
themselves
from
the
southern
standard
and
this
d
was
devoted
wholly
to
their
commander
for
this
devotion
they
certainly
had
valid
reason
never
had
leader
exhibited
a
more
systematic
unfailing
and
almost
tender
care
of
his
troops
lee
seemed
to
feel
that
these
veterans
in
their
ragged
jackets
with
their
gaunt
faces
were
personal
friends
of
his
own
who
were
entitled
to
his
most
affectionate
exertions
for
their
welfare
his
calls
on
the
civil
authorities
in
their
behalf
were
unceasing
the
burden
of
these
demands
was
that
unless
his
men
wants
were
attended
to
the
southern
cause
was
lost
and
it
plainly
revolted
his
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
that
men
upon
whom
depended
the
fate
of
the
south
should
be
shoeless
in
tatters
and
forced
to
subsist
on
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
rancid
bacon
and
a
little
corn
bread
when
thousands
remaining
out
of
the
army
and
dodging
the
were
well
clothed
and
fed
and
never
heard
the
whistle
of
a
bullet
the
men
understood
this
care
for
them
and
returned
the
affectionate
solicitude
of
their
commander
in
full
he
was
now
their
ideal
of
a
leader
and
all
that
he
did
was
perfect
in
their
eyes
all
awe
of
him
had
long
since
left
them
they
understood
what
treasures
of
kindness
and
simplicity
lay
under
the
grave
exterior
the
tattered
privates
approached
the
without
embarrassment
and
his
reception
of
them
was
such
as
to
make
them
love
him
more
than
ever
had
we
space
we
might
dwell
upon
this
marked
respect
and
attention
paid
by
general
lee
to
his
private
soldiers
he
seemed
to
think
them
more
worthy
of
marks
of
regard
than
his
highest
officers
and
there
was
never
the
least
air
of
condescension
in
him
when
thrown
with
them
but
a
perfect
simplicity
kindness
and
unaffected
sympathy
which
went
to
their
hearts
this
was
almost
a
natural
gift
with
lee
and
arose
from
the
genuine
goodness
of
his
heart
his
feeling
toward
his
soldiers
is
shown
in
an
incident
which
occurred
at
this
time
and
was
thus
related
in
one
of
the
richmond
journals
a
gentleman
who
was
in
the
train
from
this
city
to
petersburg
a
very
cold
morning
not
long
ago
tells
us
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
efforts
of
a
young
soldier
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
to
get
his
overcoat
on
his
teeth
as
well
as
his
sound
arm
were
brought
into
use
to
effect
the
object
but
in
the
midst
of
his
efforts
an
officer
rose
from
his
seat
advanced
to
him
and
very
carefully
and
tenderly
assisted
him
drawing
the
coat
gently
over
his
wounded
arm
and
buttoning
it
up
comfortably
then
with
a
few
kind
and
pleasant
words
returning
to
his
seat
now
the
officer
in
question
was
not
clad
in
gorgeous
uniform
with
a
brilliant
wreath
upon
his
collar
and
a
multitude
of
gilt
lines
upon
the
sleeves
resembling
the
famous
labyrinth
of
crete
but
he
was
clad
in
a
simple
suit
of
gray
distinguished
from
the
garb
of
a
civilian
only
by
the
three
stars
which
every
confederate
colonel
in
the
service
by
the
regulations
is
entitled
to
wear
and
yet
he
was
no
other
than
our
chief
general
robert
lee
who
is
not
braver
than
he
is
good
and
modest
to
terminate
this
brief
sketch
of
general
lee
personally
in
the
winter
of
he
looked
much
older
than
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
but
by
no
means
less
hardy
or
robust
on
the
contrary
the
arduous
campaigns
through
which
he
had
passed
seemed
to
have
hardened
him
developing
to
the
highest
degree
the
native
strength
of
his
physical
organization
his
cheeks
were
ruddy
and
his
eye
had
that
clear
light
which
indicates
the
presence
of
the
calm
will
but
his
hair
had
grown
gray
like
his
beard
and
mustache
which
were
worn
short
and
his
dress
as
always
was
a
plain
and
serviceable
gray
uniform
with
no
indications
of
rank
save
the
stars
on
the
collar
reached
nearly
to
his
knees
and
he
seldom
wore
any
weapon
a
hat
rested
low
upon
the
forehead
and
the
movements
of
this
soldierly
figure
were
as
firm
measured
and
imposing
as
ever
it
was
impossible
to
discern
in
general
lee
any
evidences
of
impaired
strength
or
any
trace
of
the
wearing
hardships
through
which
he
had
passed
he
seemed
made
of
iron
and
would
remain
in
his
saddle
all
day
and
then
at
his
desk
half
the
night
without
apparently
feeling
any
fatigue
he
was
still
almost
an
anchorite
in
his
personal
habits
and
lived
so
poorly
that
it
is
said
he
was
compelled
to
borrow
a
small
piece
of
meat
when
unexpected
visitors
dined
with
him
such
in
brief
outline
was
the
individual
upon
whose
shoulders
in
the
last
months
of
and
the
early
part
of
rested
the
southern
confederacy
xii
the
situation
at
the
beginning
of
in
approaching
the
narrative
of
the
last
tragic
scenes
of
the
confederate
struggle
the
writer
of
these
pages
experiences
emotions
of
sadness
which
will
probably
be
shared
by
not
a
few
even
of
those
readers
whose
sympathies
from
the
nature
of
things
were
on
the
side
of
the
north
to
doubt
this
would
be
painful
and
would
indicate
a
contempt
for
human
nature
not
only
in
the
eyes
of
his
friends
and
followers
but
even
in
the
eyes
of
his
bitterest
enemies
lee
must
surely
have
appeared
great
and
noble
right
or
wrong
in
the
struggle
he
believed
that
he
was
performing
his
duty
and
the
brave
army
at
his
back
which
had
fought
so
heroically
were
inspired
by
the
same
sentiment
and
risked
all
on
the
issue
this
great
soldier
was
now
about
to
suffer
the
cruellest
pang
which
the
spite
of
fate
can
inflict
and
his
army
to
be
disbanded
to
return
in
poverty
and
defeat
to
their
homes
that
spectacle
was
surely
tragic
and
appealed
to
the
hardest
heart
and
if
any
rejoiced
in
such
misery
he
must
have
been
unsusceptible
of
the
sentiment
of
admiration
for
heroism
in
misfortune
the
last
and
decisive
struggle
between
the
two
armies
at
petersburg
began
in
march
but
events
of
great
importance
in
many
quarters
had
preceded
this
final
conflict
the
result
of
which
had
been
to
break
down
all
the
outer
defences
of
the
confederacy
leaving
only
the
inner
citadel
still
intact
the
events
in
question
are
so
familiar
to
those
who
will
peruse
these
pages
that
a
passing
reference
to
them
is
all
that
is
necessary
affairs
in
the
valley
of
virginia
from
autumn
to
spring
had
steadily
proceeded
from
bad
to
worse
in
september
general
sheridan
with
a
force
of
about
thousand
had
assailed
general
early
near
winchester
with
a
force
of
about
eight
or
nine
thousand
muskets
and
succeeded
in
driving
him
up
the
valley
beyond
strasburg
whence
attacked
a
second
time
he
had
retreated
toward
staunton
this
was
followed
in
october
by
another
battle
at
cedar
run
where
early
attacked
and
nearly
crushed
general
sheridan
but
eventually
was
again
repulsed
and
forced
a
second
time
to
retreat
up
the
valley
to
waynesboro
where
in
february
his
little
remnant
was
assailed
by
overwhelming
numbers
and
dispersed
general
sheridan
who
had
effected
this
inglorious
but
important
success
then
proceeded
to
the
lowlands
joined
general
grant
army
and
was
ready
with
his
large
force
of
horse
to
take
part
in
the
coming
battles
a
more
important
success
had
attended
the
federal
arms
in
the
west
general
johnston
who
had
been
restored
to
command
there
at
the
solicitation
of
lee
had
found
his
force
insufficient
to
oppose
general
sherman
large
army
the
confederates
had
accordingly
retreated
and
general
sherman
almost
unresisted
from
the
exhaustion
of
his
adversary
marched
across
the
country
to
savannah
which
fell
an
easy
prize
and
thence
advanced
to
goldsborough
in
north
carolina
where
he
directly
threatened
lee
line
of
retreat
from
virginia
such
was
the
condition
of
affairs
in
the
months
of
february
and
march
in
the
former
month
commissioners
from
the
confederate
government
had
met
president
lincoln
in
hampton
roads
but
no
terms
of
peace
could
be
agreed
upon
the
issue
was
still
left
to
be
decided
by
arms
and
every
advantage
was
upon
the
federal
side
general
lee
who
had
just
been
appointed
having
thus
imposed
upon
him
the
mockery
of
a
rank
no
longer
of
any
value
saw
the
armies
of
the
enemy
closing
in
upon
him
and
did
not
deceive
himself
with
the
empty
hope
that
he
could
longer
hold
his
lines
at
petersburg
the
country
oppressed
as
it
was
and
laboring
under
a
sentiment
akin
to
despair
still
retained
in
almost
undiminished
measure
its
superstitious
confidence
in
him
but
he
himself
saw
clearly
the
desperate
character
of
the
situation
general
grant
was
in
his
front
with
a
force
of
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
and
general
sherman
was
about
to
enter
virginia
with
an
army
of
about
the
same
numbers
lee
force
at
petersburg
was
a
little
over
thirty
thousand
men
that
of
johnston
was
not
so
great
and
was
detained
by
sherman
under
these
circumstances
it
was
obviously
only
a
question
of
time
when
the
army
of
northern
virginia
would
be
overwhelmed
in
february
these
facts
were
perfectly
apparent
to
general
lee
but
one
course
was
left
to
him
to
retreat
from
virginia
and
he
promptly
began
that
movement
in
the
latter
part
of
the
month
ordering
his
trains
to
amelia
and
directing
pontoons
to
be
got
ready
at
roanoke
river
his
aim
was
simple
to
unite
his
army
with
that
of
general
johnston
and
retreat
into
the
gulf
states
in
the
mountains
of
virginia
he
could
carry
on
the
war
he
had
said
for
twenty
years
in
the
fertile
regions
of
the
south
he
might
expect
to
prolong
hostilities
or
at
least
make
favorable
terms
of
peace
which
would
be
better
than
to
remain
in
virginia
until
he
was
completely
surrounded
and
an
unconditional
submission
would
alone
be
left
him
it
will
probably
remain
a
subject
of
regret
to
military
students
that
lee
was
not
permitted
to
carry
out
this
retreat
into
the
gulf
states
the
movement
was
arrested
after
a
consultation
with
the
civil
authorities
at
richmond
upon
what
grounds
a
course
so
obviously
necessary
was
opposed
the
present
writer
is
unable
to
declare
whatever
the
considerations
lee
yielded
his
judgment
the
movement
suddenly
stopped
and
the
army
of
northern
virginia
if
a
skeleton
can
be
called
such
remained
to
await
its
fate
the
condition
of
the
army
in
which
companies
scarce
existed
regiments
were
counted
by
tens
and
divisions
by
hundreds
only
need
not
here
be
elaborately
dwelt
upon
it
was
indeed
the
phantom
of
an
army
and
the
gaunt
faces
were
almost
ghostly
shoeless
in
rags
with
just
sufficient
coarse
food
to
sustain
life
but
never
enough
to
keep
at
the
gnawing
fiend
hunger
lee
old
veterans
remained
firm
scattered
like
a
thin
along
forty
miles
of
works
while
opposite
them
lay
an
enemy
in
the
highest
state
of
efficiency
and
numbering
nearly
five
men
to
their
one
that
the
soldiers
of
the
army
retained
their
nerve
under
circumstances
so
discouraging
is
surely
an
honorable
fact
and
will
make
their
names
glorious
in
history
they
remained
unshaken
and
fought
undismayed
to
the
last
although
their
courage
was
subjected
to
trials
of
the
most
exhausting
character
day
and
night
for
month
after
month
the
incessant
fire
of
the
federal
forces
had
continued
and
every
engine
of
human
destruction
had
been
put
in
play
to
wear
away
their
strength
they
fought
all
through
the
cheerless
days
of
winter
and
when
they
lay
down
in
the
cold
trenches
at
night
the
shell
of
the
federal
mortars
rained
down
upon
them
bursting
and
mortally
wounding
them
all
day
long
the
fire
of
muskets
and
cannon
then
from
sunset
to
dawn
the
curving
fire
of
the
roaring
mortars
and
the
steady
crack
of
the
along
the
front
snow
or
blinding
sleet
or
freezing
rains
might
be
falling
but
the
fire
went
on
it
seemed
destined
to
go
on
to
all
eternity
in
march
however
the
end
was
approaching
and
general
lee
must
have
felt
that
all
was
lost
his
last
hope
had
been
the
retreat
southward
in
the
month
of
february
that
hope
had
been
taken
from
him
the
result
was
at
hand
and
his
private
correspondence
if
he
intrusted
to
paper
his
views
of
the
situation
will
probably
show
that
from
that
moment
he
gave
up
all
anticipation
of
success
and
prepared
to
do
his
simple
duty
as
a
soldier
leaving
the
issue
of
affairs
to
providence
whatever
may
have
been
his
emotions
they
were
not
reflected
in
his
countenance
the
same
august
composure
which
had
accompanied
him
in
his
previous
campaigns
remained
with
him
still
and
cheered
the
fainting
hearts
around
him
to
the
of
april
and
even
up
to
the
end
this
remarkable
calmness
continued
nearly
unchanged
and
we
can
offer
no
explanation
of
a
circumstance
so
astonishing
save
that
which
we
have
already
given
in
a
preceding
chapter
xiii
lee
attacks
the
federal
centre
general
lee
became
aware
as
the
end
of
march
drew
near
that
preparations
were
being
made
in
the
federal
army
for
some
important
movement
what
that
movement
would
be
there
was
little
reason
to
doubt
the
federal
lines
had
been
extended
gradually
toward
the
southside
railroad
and
it
was
obvious
now
that
general
grant
had
in
view
a
last
and
decisive
advance
in
that
quarter
which
should
place
him
on
his
opponent
communications
and
completely
intercept
his
retreat
southward
the
catastrophe
which
general
lee
had
plainly
foreseen
for
many
months
now
stared
him
in
the
face
and
unless
he
had
recourse
to
some
expedient
as
desperate
as
the
situation
the
end
of
the
struggle
must
soon
come
the
sole
course
left
to
him
was
retreat
but
this
now
seemed
difficult
if
not
impossible
general
grant
had
a
powerful
force
not
far
from
the
main
roads
over
which
lee
must
move
and
unless
a
diversion
of
some
description
were
made
it
seemed
barely
possible
that
the
southern
army
could
extricate
itself
this
diversion
general
lee
now
proceeded
to
make
and
although
we
have
no
authority
to
state
that
his
object
was
to
follow
up
the
blow
if
it
were
successful
by
an
evacuation
of
his
lines
at
petersburg
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
what
other
design
he
could
have
had
in
risking
an
operation
so
critical
he
had
resolved
to
throw
a
column
against
the
federal
centre
east
of
petersburg
with
the
view
to
break
through
there
and
seize
the
commanding
ground
in
rear
of
the
line
he
would
thus
be
rooted
in
the
middle
of
general
grant
army
and
the
federal
left
would
probably
be
recalled
leaving
the
way
open
if
he
designed
to
retreat
if
he
designed
however
to
fight
a
last
pitched
battle
which
should
decide
all
he
would
be
able
to
do
so
in
case
the
federal
works
were
broken
to
greater
advantage
than
under
any
other
circumstances
the
point
fixed
upon
was
fort
steadman
near
the
south
bank
of
the
appomattox
where
the
opposing
works
were
scarcely
two
hundred
yards
from
each
other
the
ground
in
front
was
covered
with
and
otherwise
obstructed
but
it
was
hoped
that
the
assaulting
column
would
be
able
to
pass
over
the
distance
undiscovered
in
that
event
a
sudden
rush
would
probably
carry
the
works
a
large
part
of
the
army
would
follow
the
hill
beyond
would
be
occupied
and
general
grant
would
be
compelled
to
concentrate
his
army
at
the
point
for
his
own
protection
on
the
morning
of
march
before
dawn
the
column
was
ready
it
consisted
of
three
or
four
thousand
men
under
general
gordon
but
an
additional
force
was
held
in
reserve
to
follow
up
the
attack
if
it
succeeded
just
as
dawn
appeared
gordon
put
his
column
in
motion
it
advanced
silently
over
the
intervening
space
made
a
rush
for
the
federal
works
mounted
them
drove
from
them
in
great
confusion
the
force
occupying
them
and
a
loud
cheer
proved
that
the
column
of
gordon
had
done
its
work
but
this
auspicious
beginning
was
the
only
success
achieved
by
the
confederates
for
reasons
unknown
to
the
present
writer
the
force
directed
by
lee
to
be
held
in
readiness
and
to
move
at
once
to
gordon
support
did
not
go
forward
the
brave
commander
and
his
men
were
left
to
breast
the
whole
weight
of
the
federal
onslaught
which
ensued
and
disaster
followed
the
first
great
success
the
forts
to
the
right
and
left
of
fort
steadman
suddenly
opened
their
thunders
and
something
like
a
repetition
of
the
scene
succeeding
the
mine
explosion
ensued
a
considerable
portion
of
the
assaulting
column
was
unable
to
get
back
and
fell
into
the
hands
their
works
were
quickly
reoccupied
and
lee
saw
that
his
last
hope
had
failed
nothing
was
left
to
him
now
but
such
courageous
resistance
as
it
was
in
his
power
to
make
and
he
prepared
with
the
worn
weapon
which
he
still
held
in
his
firm
grasp
to
oppose
as
he
best
could
the
immense
hammer
to
use
general
grant
own
illustration
which
was
plainly
about
to
be
raised
to
strike
xiv
the
southern
lines
broken
the
hour
of
the
final
struggle
now
rapidly
drew
near
on
the
of
march
general
lee
discovered
that
a
large
portion
of
the
federal
army
was
moving
steadily
in
the
direction
of
his
works
beyond
burgen
mill
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
what
this
movement
signified
general
grant
was
plainly
about
to
make
a
decisive
attack
on
the
confederate
right
on
the
road
and
if
that
attack
succeeded
lee
was
lost
had
not
general
lee
and
his
men
become
accustomed
to
retain
their
coolness
under
almost
any
circumstances
of
trial
the
prospect
now
before
them
must
have
filled
them
with
despair
the
bulk
of
the
federal
army
was
obviously
about
to
be
thrown
against
the
confederate
right
and
it
was
no
secret
in
the
little
body
of
southerners
that
lee
would
be
able
to
send
thither
only
a
painfully
inadequate
force
unless
his
extensive
works
were
left
in
charge
of
a
mere
line
of
skirmishers
this
could
not
be
thought
of
the
struggle
on
the
right
must
be
a
desperate
one
and
the
southern
troops
must
depend
upon
hard
fighting
rather
than
numbers
if
they
hoped
to
repulse
the
attack
of
the
enemy
such
was
the
situation
of
affairs
and
neither
the
confederate
commander
nor
his
men
shrunk
in
the
hour
of
trial
leaving
longstreet
to
confront
the
enemy
north
of
the
james
and
gordon
in
command
of
ewell
corps
if
it
could
be
called
such
in
front
of
petersburg
lee
moved
with
nearly
the
whole
remainder
of
his
small
force
westward
beyond
hatcher
run
to
meet
the
anticipated
attack
the
force
thus
moved
to
the
right
to
receive
general
grant
great
assault
consisted
of
about
fifteen
thousand
infantry
and
about
two
thousand
cavalry
under
general
fitz
lee
who
in
consequence
of
the
departure
of
hampton
to
north
carolina
now
commanded
the
cavalry
of
the
army
this
force
however
was
cavalry
only
in
name
and
general
lee
speaking
afterward
of
general
sheridan
said
that
his
victories
were
won
when
we
had
no
horses
for
our
cavalry
and
no
men
to
ride
the
few
steeds
that
we
could
muster
with
this
force
amounting
in
all
to
about
seventeen
thousand
men
lee
proceeded
to
take
position
behind
the
works
extending
along
the
road
in
the
direction
of
five
forks
an
important
beyond
his
extreme
right
the
number
of
men
left
north
of
james
river
and
in
front
of
petersburg
was
a
little
under
twenty
thousand
as
general
grant
had
at
his
command
a
force
about
four
times
as
great
as
his
adversary
it
seemed
scarcely
possible
that
lee
would
be
able
to
offer
serious
resistance
it
soon
became
evident
however
that
in
spite
of
this
great
disproportion
of
force
general
lee
had
determined
to
fight
to
the
last
to
attribute
this
determination
to
despair
and
recklessness
would
be
doing
injustice
to
the
great
soldier
it
was
still
possible
that
he
might
be
able
to
repulse
the
assault
upon
his
right
and
by
disabling
the
federal
force
there
open
his
line
of
retreat
to
this
hope
he
no
doubt
clung
and
the
of
his
race
was
now
thoroughly
aroused
at
chancellorsville
and
elsewhere
the
odds
had
been
nearly
as
great
and
a
glance
at
his
gaunt
veterans
showed
him
that
they
might
still
be
depended
upon
for
a
struggle
as
obstinate
as
any
in
the
past
history
of
the
war
the
event
certainly
vindicated
the
justice
of
this
latter
view
and
we
shall
briefly
trace
the
occurrences
of
the
next
three
or
four
days
which
terminated
the
long
conflict
at
petersburg
general
grant
assaulting
force
was
not
in
position
near
the
boydton
road
beyond
hatcher
run
until
march
when
before
he
could
attack
lee
suddenly
advanced
and
made
a
furious
onslaught
on
the
federal
front
before
this
attack
the
divisions
first
encountered
gave
way
in
confusion
and
it
seemed
that
the
confederate
commander
at
a
single
blow
was
about
to
extricate
himself
from
his
embarrassing
situation
the
force
opposed
to
him
however
was
too
great
and
he
found
himself
unable
to
encounter
it
in
the
open
field
he
therefore
fell
back
to
his
works
and
the
fighting
ceased
only
to
be
renewed
however
at
five
forks
this
had
been
seized
by
the
cavalry
of
general
sheridan
and
as
the
point
was
one
of
importance
lee
detached
a
small
body
of
infantry
to
drive
away
the
federal
horse
this
was
done
without
difficulty
and
the
confederate
infantry
then
advanced
toward
dinwiddie
but
late
at
night
it
was
withdrawn
and
the
day
fighting
ended
on
the
next
day
the
of
april
a
more
determined
struggle
ensued
for
the
possession
of
five
forks
where
lee
had
stationed
the
small
remnants
of
the
divisions
of
pickett
and
johnson
these
made
a
brave
resistance
but
were
wholly
unable
to
stand
before
the
force
brought
against
them
they
maintained
their
ground
as
long
as
possible
but
were
finally
broken
to
pieces
and
scattered
in
confusion
the
whole
right
of
the
confederate
line
and
the
southside
road
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
illustration
lee
at
petersburg
this
was
virtually
the
end
of
the
contest
but
general
grant
it
would
appear
deemed
it
inexpedient
to
venture
any
thing
so
thinly
manned
were
the
lines
in
front
of
petersburg
in
the
absence
of
longstreet
north
of
james
river
and
the
troops
sent
beyond
hatcher
run
that
on
the
of
april
the
federal
commander
might
have
broken
through
the
works
at
almost
any
point
he
elected
to
wait
however
until
the
following
day
thereby
running
the
risk
of
awaking
to
find
that
lee
had
retreated
at
dawn
on
the
the
long
struggle
ended
the
federal
forces
advanced
all
along
the
confederate
front
made
a
furious
attack
and
breaking
through
in
front
of
the
city
carried
all
before
them
the
forts
especially
fort
gregg
made
a
gallant
resistance
this
work
was
defended
by
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
of
harris
mississippi
brigade
and
these
fought
until
their
numbers
were
reduced
to
thirty
killing
or
wounding
five
hundred
of
the
assailants
the
fort
was
taken
at
last
and
the
federal
lines
advanced
toward
the
city
in
this
attack
fell
the
eminent
soldier
general
hill
whose
record
had
been
so
illustrious
and
whose
fortune
it
was
to
thus
terminate
his
life
while
the
southern
flag
still
floated
xv
lee
evacuates
petersburg
any
further
resistance
upon
the
part
of
general
lee
seemed
now
impossible
and
nothing
appeared
to
be
left
him
but
to
surrender
his
army
this
course
he
does
not
seem
however
to
have
contemplated
it
was
still
possible
that
he
might
be
able
to
maintain
his
position
on
an
inner
line
near
the
city
until
night
and
if
he
could
do
so
the
friendly
hours
of
darkness
might
enable
him
to
make
good
his
retreat
to
the
north
bank
of
the
appomattox
and
shape
his
course
toward
north
carolina
where
general
johnston
awaited
him
if
the
movements
of
the
federal
forces
however
were
so
prompt
as
to
defeat
his
march
in
that
direction
he
might
still
be
able
to
reach
lynchburg
beyond
which
point
the
defiles
of
the
alleghanies
promised
him
protection
against
the
utmost
efforts
of
his
enemy
of
his
ability
to
reach
north
carolina
following
the
line
of
the
danville
railroad
lee
however
seems
to
have
had
no
doubt
the
federal
army
would
not
probably
be
able
to
concentrate
in
sufficient
force
in
his
path
to
bar
his
progress
if
his
march
were
rapid
if
detached
bodies
only
opposed
him
on
his
line
of
retreat
there
was
little
doubt
that
the
army
of
northern
virginia
reduced
as
it
was
would
be
able
to
cut
its
way
through
them
this
preface
is
necessary
to
an
intelligent
comprehension
of
movements
on
the
unfortunate
of
april
when
his
lines
were
broken
this
occurrence
took
place
as
we
have
said
about
sunrise
and
an
hour
or
two
afterward
the
federal
forces
pressed
forward
all
along
the
line
surging
toward
the
suburbs
of
petersburg
we
have
mentioned
the
position
of
general
lee
headquarters
about
a
mile
and
a
half
west
of
the
city
on
the
cox
road
nearly
opposite
the
tall
federal
observatory
standing
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
his
headquarters
general
lee
now
saw
approaching
rapidly
a
heavy
column
of
federal
infantry
with
the
obvious
design
of
charging
a
battery
which
had
opened
fire
upon
them
from
a
hill
to
the
right
the
spectacle
was
picturesque
and
striking
across
the
extensive
fields
houses
set
on
fire
by
shell
were
sending
aloft
huge
clouds
of
smoke
and
tongues
of
flame
at
every
instant
was
seen
the
quick
glare
of
the
federal
artillery
firing
from
every
knoll
and
in
front
came
on
the
charging
column
moving
at
a
double
quick
with
burnished
and
bayonets
flashing
in
the
april
sunshine
general
lee
watched
with
attention
but
with
perfect
composure
this
determined
advance
of
the
enemy
and
although
he
must
have
realized
that
his
army
was
on
the
verge
of
destruction
it
was
impossible
to
discern
in
his
features
any
evidences
of
emotion
he
was
in
full
uniform
and
had
buckled
on
his
which
he
seldom
wore
having
on
this
morning
declared
it
is
said
that
if
he
were
compelled
to
surrender
he
would
do
so
in
full
harness
of
his
calmness
at
this
trying
moment
the
writer
is
able
to
bear
his
personal
testimony
chancing
to
hear
a
question
addressed
to
a
member
of
his
staff
general
lee
turned
with
great
courtesy
raised
his
gray
hat
in
response
to
the
writer
salute
and
gave
him
the
desired
information
in
a
voice
entirely
measured
and
composed
it
was
impossible
to
regard
a
calmness
so
striking
without
strong
sentiments
of
admiration
and
lee
appearance
and
bearing
at
this
moment
will
always
remain
vividly
impressed
upon
the
writer
memory
the
federal
column
was
soon
in
dangerous
proximity
to
the
battery
on
the
hill
and
it
was
obliged
to
retire
at
a
gallop
to
escape
capture
an
attempt
was
made
to
hold
the
ground
near
the
headquarters
but
a
close
from
the
enemy
rendered
this
also
impossible
the
artillery
was
withdrawn
and
general
lee
mounting
his
slowly
rode
back
accompanied
by
a
number
of
officers
toward
his
inner
line
he
still
remained
entirely
composed
and
only
said
to
one
of
his
staff
in
his
habitual
tone
this
is
a
bad
business
colonel
well
colonel
he
said
afterward
to
another
officer
it
has
happened
as
i
told
them
it
would
at
richmond
the
line
has
been
stretched
until
it
has
broken
the
federal
column
was
now
pressing
forward
along
the
cox
road
toward
petersburg
and
general
lee
continued
to
ride
slowly
back
in
the
direction
of
the
city
he
was
probably
recognized
by
officers
of
the
federal
artillery
or
his
drew
their
fire
the
group
was
furiously
shelled
and
one
of
the
shells
burst
a
few
feet
in
rear
of
him
killing
the
horse
of
an
officer
near
him
cutting
the
of
others
and
tearing
up
the
ground
in
his
immediate
vicinity
this
incident
seemed
to
arouse
in
general
lee
his
he
turned
his
head
over
his
right
shoulder
his
cheeks
became
flushed
and
a
sudden
flash
of
the
eye
showed
with
what
reluctance
he
retired
before
the
fire
directed
upon
him
no
other
course
was
left
him
however
and
he
continued
to
ride
slowly
toward
his
inner
line
a
low
earthwork
in
the
suburbs
of
the
city
where
a
small
force
was
drawn
up
ardent
hopeful
defiant
and
saluting
the
shell
now
bursting
above
them
with
cheers
and
laughter
it
was
plain
that
the
of
the
ragged
troops
remained
unbroken
and
the
shout
of
welcome
with
which
they
received
lee
indicated
their
unwavering
confidence
in
him
despite
the
untoward
condition
of
affairs
arrangements
were
speedily
made
to
hold
the
inner
line
if
possible
until
night
to
general
gordon
had
been
intrusted
the
important
duty
of
defending
the
lines
east
of
the
city
and
general
longstreet
had
been
directed
to
vacate
the
works
north
of
james
river
and
march
at
once
to
the
lines
of
petersburg
this
officer
made
his
appearance
with
his
small
force
at
an
early
hour
of
the
day
and
except
that
the
federal
army
continued
firing
all
along
the
front
no
other
active
operations
took
place
to
those
present
on
the
confederate
side
this
fact
appeared
strange
as
the
force
beyond
hatcher
run
had
been
completely
defeated
and
dispersed
general
lee
numbers
for
the
defence
of
petersburg
on
this
day
did
not
amount
to
much
if
any
more
than
fifteen
thousand
men
general
grant
force
was
probably
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
of
whom
about
one
hundred
thousand
might
it
would
appear
have
been
concentrated
in
an
hour
or
two
directly
in
front
of
the
city
that
with
this
large
force
at
his
disposal
the
federal
commander
did
not
at
once
attack
and
so
end
all
on
that
day
surprised
the
confederate
troops
and
still
continues
to
surprise
the
writer
night
came
at
last
and
general
lee
began
his
retreat
he
had
sent
early
in
the
morning
a
dispatch
to
the
civil
authorities
at
richmond
informing
them
of
the
fact
that
his
lines
had
been
broken
and
that
he
would
that
night
retreat
from
petersburg
orders
had
also
been
sent
to
all
the
forces
holding
the
lines
north
of
james
river
to
move
at
once
and
join
him
and
just
at
nightfall
the
army
at
petersburg
began
crossing
the
appomattox
this
movement
was
effected
without
interruption
from
the
enemy
and
the
army
turning
into
what
is
called
the
hickory
road
leading
up
the
north
bank
of
the
river
moved
on
steadily
through
the
half
light
its
march
was
superintended
by
lee
in
person
he
had
stationed
himself
at
the
mouth
of
the
hickory
road
and
standing
with
the
bridle
of
his
horse
in
his
hand
gave
his
orders
his
bearing
still
remained
entirely
composed
and
his
voice
had
lost
none
of
its
grave
strength
of
intonation
when
the
rear
was
well
closed
up
lee
mounted
his
horse
rode
on
slowly
with
his
men
and
in
the
midst
of
the
glare
and
thunder
of
the
exploding
magazines
at
petersburg
the
small
remnant
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
amounting
to
about
fifteen
thousand
men
went
on
its
way
through
the
darkness
xvi
the
retreat
and
surrender
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
general
lee
after
allowing
his
column
a
brief
period
of
rest
continued
his
march
up
the
north
bank
of
the
appomattox
the
aspect
of
affairs
at
this
time
was
threatening
and
there
seemed
little
ground
to
hope
that
the
small
force
would
be
able
to
make
good
its
retreat
to
north
carolina
general
grant
had
a
short
and
direct
route
to
the
danville
railroad
a
considerable
portion
of
his
army
was
already
as
far
west
as
dinwiddie
and
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
only
to
use
ordinary
diligence
to
completely
cut
general
lee
off
in
the
vicinity
of
burkesville
junction
a
glance
at
the
map
will
indicate
the
advantages
possessed
by
the
federal
commander
he
could
move
over
the
chord
while
lee
was
compelled
to
follow
the
arc
of
the
circle
unless
good
fortune
assisted
lee
and
ill
fortune
impeded
his
opponent
the
event
seemed
certain
and
it
will
be
seen
that
these
conditions
were
completely
reversed
under
the
circumstances
here
stated
it
appeared
reasonable
to
expect
in
lee
and
his
army
some
depression
of
spirits
the
fact
was
strikingly
the
reverse
the
army
was
in
excellent
spirits
probably
from
the
contrast
of
the
budding
april
woods
with
the
squalid
trenches
and
the
joy
of
an
unfettered
march
through
the
fields
of
spring
general
lee
shared
this
hopeful
feeling
in
a
very
remarkable
degree
his
expression
was
animated
and
buoyant
his
seat
in
the
saddle
erect
and
commanding
and
he
seemed
to
look
forward
to
assured
success
in
the
critical
movement
which
he
had
undertaken
i
have
got
my
army
safe
out
of
its
breastworks
he
said
on
the
morning
of
this
day
and
in
order
to
follow
me
the
enemy
must
abandon
his
lines
and
can
derive
no
further
benefit
from
his
railroads
or
james
river
the
design
of
the
confederate
commander
has
been
already
stated
but
an
important
condition
upon
which
he
depended
for
success
has
not
been
mentioned
this
was
a
supply
of
food
for
his
army
the
troops
during
the
whole
winter
had
lived
from
day
to
day
on
doled
out
to
them
with
a
sparing
hand
and
in
moving
now
from
petersburg
lee
saw
that
he
must
look
to
supplies
somewhere
upon
his
line
of
retreat
these
he
had
directed
to
be
brought
from
the
south
and
deposited
at
amelia
and
the
expectation
of
finding
at
that
point
full
subsistence
for
his
men
had
doubtless
a
great
effect
in
buoying
up
his
spirits
an
evil
chance
however
reversed
all
the
hopes
based
on
this
anticipation
from
fault
or
misapprehension
the
train
loaded
with
supplies
proceeded
to
richmond
without
depositing
the
rations
at
amelia
there
was
no
time
to
obtain
other
subsistence
and
when
after
unforeseen
delay
in
consequence
of
high
water
in
the
appomattox
lee
at
the
head
of
his
soldiers
reached
amelia
it
was
only
to
find
that
there
was
nothing
there
for
the
support
of
his
army
and
to
realize
that
a
successful
retreat
under
the
circumstances
was
wellnigh
hopeless
those
who
accompanied
the
southern
army
on
this
arduous
march
will
recall
the
dismayed
expression
of
the
emaciated
faces
at
this
calamity
and
no
face
wore
a
heavier
shadow
than
that
of
general
lee
the
failure
of
the
supply
of
rations
completely
paralyzed
him
he
had
intended
and
was
confident
of
his
ability
to
cut
his
way
through
the
enemy
but
an
army
can
not
march
and
fight
without
food
it
was
now
necessary
to
halt
and
send
out
foraging
parties
into
the
impoverished
region
around
meanwhile
general
grant
with
his
great
force
was
rapidly
moving
to
bar
his
adversary
further
advance
the
want
of
a
few
thousand
pounds
of
bread
and
meat
had
virtually
terminated
the
war
an
anxious
and
haggard
expression
came
to
general
lee
face
when
he
was
informed
of
this
great
misfortune
and
at
once
abandoning
his
design
of
cutting
his
way
through
to
north
carolina
he
turned
westward
and
shaped
his
march
toward
lynchburg
this
movement
began
on
the
night
of
the
of
april
and
it
would
seem
that
general
grant
had
had
it
in
his
power
to
arrest
it
by
an
attack
on
lee
at
amelia
general
sheridan
was
in
the
immediate
vicinity
with
a
force
of
about
eighteen
thousand
cavalry
and
although
it
was
not
probable
that
this
command
could
effect
any
thing
against
lee
army
of
about
the
same
number
of
infantry
it
might
still
have
delayed
him
by
constructing
breastworks
in
his
way
and
thus
giving
the
federal
infantry
time
to
come
up
and
attack
illustration
lee
at
the
surrender
the
opportunity
of
crushing
his
adversary
at
amelia
was
thus
allowed
to
pass
and
general
grant
now
pressed
forward
his
infantry
to
bring
lee
to
bay
if
possible
before
he
reached
lynchburg
from
this
moment
began
the
struggle
between
the
adversaries
which
was
to
continue
day
and
night
without
intermission
for
the
next
four
days
the
phenomenon
was
here
presented
of
an
army
reduced
to
less
than
twenty
thousand
men
holding
at
an
enemy
numbering
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
and
very
nearly
defeating
every
effort
of
the
larger
force
to
arrest
their
march
it
would
not
interest
the
reader
probably
to
follow
in
minute
detail
the
circumstances
of
this
melancholy
retreat
from
the
importance
of
the
transactions
and
the
natural
attention
directed
to
them
both
north
and
south
they
are
doubtless
familiar
to
all
who
will
read
these
pages
we
shall
only
speak
of
one
or
two
incidents
of
the
retreat
wherein
general
lee
appeared
prominent
personally
leaving
to
the
imagination
of
the
reader
the
remainder
of
the
long
and
tragic
struggle
whose
result
decided
the
fate
of
the
confederacy
general
grant
doubtless
saw
now
that
every
thing
depended
upon
the
celerity
of
his
movements
and
sending
in
advance
his
large
body
of
cavalry
he
hastened
forward
as
rapidly
as
possible
with
his
infantry
bent
on
interposing
if
possible
a
heavy
force
in
his
front
lee
movements
were
equally
rapid
he
seemed
speedily
to
have
regained
his
old
calmness
after
the
trying
disappointment
at
amelia
and
those
who
shared
his
counsels
at
this
time
can
testify
that
the
idea
of
surrender
scarcely
entered
his
mind
for
a
moment
or
if
it
did
so
was
speedily
banished
under
the
pressure
of
circumstances
so
adverse
that
they
seemed
calculated
to
break
down
the
most
stubborn
resolution
general
lee
did
not
falter
and
throughout
the
disheartening
scenes
of
the
retreat
from
the
moment
when
he
left
amelia
to
the
hour
when
his
little
column
was
drawing
near
appomattox
still
continued
to
believe
that
the
situation
was
not
desperate
and
that
he
would
be
able
to
force
his
way
through
to
lynchburg
on
the
evening
of
the
when
the
army
was
near
farmville
a
sudden
attack
was
made
by
the
federal
cavalry
on
the
trains
of
the
army
moving
on
a
parallel
road
and
the
small
force
of
infantry
guarding
them
was
broken
and
scattered
this
occurrence
took
place
while
general
lee
was
confronting
a
body
of
federal
infantry
near
creek
and
taking
a
small
brigade
he
immediately
repaired
to
the
scene
of
danger
the
spectacle
which
followed
was
a
very
striking
and
imposing
one
and
is
thus
described
by
one
who
witnessed
it
the
scene
was
one
of
gloomy
picturesqueness
and
tragic
interest
on
a
plateau
raised
above
the
forest
from
which
they
had
emerged
were
the
disorganized
troops
of
ewell
and
anderson
gathered
in
groups
and
uttering
tumultuous
exclamations
of
rage
and
defiance
rising
above
the
weary
groups
which
had
thrown
themselves
upon
the
ground
were
the
grim
barrels
of
cannon
in
battery
ready
to
fire
as
soon
as
the
enemy
appeared
in
front
of
all
was
the
still
line
of
battle
just
placed
by
lee
and
waiting
calmly
general
lee
had
rushed
his
infantry
over
just
at
sunset
leading
it
in
person
his
face
animated
and
his
eye
brilliant
with
the
soldier
spirit
of
fight
but
his
bearing
unflurried
as
before
an
artist
desiring
to
paint
his
picture
ought
to
have
seen
the
old
cavalier
at
this
moment
sweeping
on
upon
his
large
whose
mane
and
tail
floated
in
the
wind
carrying
his
in
his
right
hand
with
head
erect
gestures
animated
and
in
the
whole
face
and
form
the
expression
of
the
hunter
close
upon
his
game
the
line
once
interposed
he
rode
in
the
twilight
among
the
disordered
groups
above
mentioned
and
the
sight
of
him
aroused
a
tumult
fierce
cries
resounded
on
all
sides
and
with
hands
clinched
violently
and
raised
aloft
the
men
called
on
him
to
lead
them
against
the
enemy
general
lee
robert
the
man
who
wo
follow
uncle
robert
i
heard
on
all
sides
the
swarthy
faces
full
of
dirt
and
courage
lit
up
every
instant
by
the
glare
of
the
burning
wagons
altogether
the
scene
was
indescribable
on
the
the
army
pressed
on
beyond
farmville
still
harassed
as
it
advanced
by
the
federal
infantry
and
cavalry
but
in
some
of
these
encounters
the
pursuing
force
met
with
what
was
probably
a
very
unexpected
discomfiture
general
fitz
lee
bringing
up
the
rear
of
the
army
with
his
force
of
about
fifteen
hundred
cavalry
on
horses
succeeded
not
only
in
repulsing
the
attacks
of
the
large
and
force
under
general
sheridan
but
achieved
over
them
successes
one
such
incident
took
place
on
the
when
general
gregg
attacked
with
about
six
thousand
horse
but
was
met
defeated
and
captured
by
general
fitz
lee
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
general
lee
who
said
to
his
son
general
lee
keep
your
command
together
and
in
good
spirits
general
do
let
them
think
of
surrender
i
will
get
you
out
of
this
on
the
and
however
this
hope
seemed
unwarranted
by
the
circumstances
and
the
appeared
to
be
almost
the
only
human
being
who
remained
sanguine
of
the
result
the
hardships
of
the
retreat
arising
chiefly
from
want
of
food
began
to
seriously
impair
the
resolution
of
the
troops
and
the
scenes
through
which
they
advanced
were
not
calculated
to
raise
their
spirits
these
scenes
declares
one
who
witnessed
them
were
of
a
nature
which
can
be
apprehended
only
by
men
who
are
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
harrowing
details
of
war
behind
and
on
either
flank
a
ubiquitous
and
increasingly
adventurous
enemy
every
and
every
rise
in
the
road
choked
with
blazing
wagons
the
air
filled
with
the
deafening
reports
of
ammunition
exploding
and
shells
bursting
when
touched
by
the
flames
dense
columns
of
smoke
ascending
to
heaven
from
the
burning
and
exploding
vehicles
exhausted
men
mules
and
horses
lying
down
side
by
side
gaunt
famine
glaring
hopelessly
from
sunken
eyes
dead
mules
dead
horses
dead
men
everywhere
death
many
times
welcomed
as
god
messenger
in
disguise
who
can
wonder
if
many
hearts
tried
in
the
fiery
furnace
of
four
unparalleled
years
and
never
hitherto
found
wanting
should
have
quailed
in
presence
of
starvation
fatigue
sleeplessness
misery
unintermitted
for
five
or
six
days
and
culminating
in
hopelessness
it
can
not
however
be
said
with
truth
that
any
considerable
portion
of
the
southern
forces
were
greatly
demoralized
to
use
the
military
phrase
as
the
fighting
of
the
last
two
days
when
the
suffering
of
the
retreat
culminated
will
show
the
men
were
almost
entirely
without
food
and
were
glad
to
find
a
little
corn
to
eat
but
those
who
were
not
physically
unable
longer
to
carry
their
muskets
and
the
number
of
these
latter
was
large
still
marched
and
fought
with
soldierly
cheerfulness
and
resolution
general
lee
spirits
do
not
seem
at
any
time
to
have
flagged
and
up
to
a
late
period
of
the
retreat
he
had
not
seriously
contemplated
surrender
the
necessity
for
this
painful
course
came
home
to
his
corps
commanders
first
and
they
requested
general
pendleton
the
efficient
chief
of
artillery
of
the
army
to
inform
general
lee
that
in
their
opinion
further
struggle
was
hopeless
general
pendleton
informed
general
lee
of
this
opinion
of
his
officers
and
it
seemed
to
communicate
something
like
a
shock
to
him
surrender
he
exclaimed
with
a
flash
of
the
eye
i
have
too
many
good
for
that
nevertheless
the
necessity
of
seriously
contemplating
this
result
was
soon
forced
upon
him
since
the
morning
of
the
a
correspondence
had
taken
place
between
himself
and
general
grant
and
as
these
notes
are
interesting
we
here
present
those
which
were
exchanged
up
to
the
night
of
the
lee
commanding
general
the
result
of
the
last
week
must
convince
you
of
the
hopelessness
of
further
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
in
this
struggle
i
feel
that
it
is
so
and
regard
it
as
my
duty
to
shift
from
myself
the
responsibility
of
any
further
effusion
of
blood
by
asking
of
you
the
surrender
of
that
portion
of
the
confederate
southern
army
known
as
the
army
of
northern
virginia
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
grant
commanding
armies
of
the
united
general
i
have
received
your
note
of
this
day
though
not
entirely
of
the
opinion
you
express
of
the
hopelessness
of
further
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
i
reciprocate
your
desire
to
avoid
useless
effusion
of
blood
and
therefore
before
considering
your
proposition
ask
the
terms
you
will
offer
on
condition
of
its
surrender
lee
to
grant
armies
of
the
united
general
lee
commanding
general
your
note
of
last
evening
in
reply
to
mine
of
the
same
date
asking
the
conditions
on
which
i
will
accept
the
surrender
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
is
just
received
in
reply
i
would
say
that
peace
being
my
first
desire
there
is
but
one
condition
that
i
insist
upon
viz
that
the
men
surrendered
shall
be
disqualified
for
taking
up
arms
again
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
until
properly
exchanged
i
will
meet
you
or
designate
officers
to
meet
any
officers
you
may
name
for
the
same
purpose
at
any
point
agreeable
to
you
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
definitely
the
terms
upon
which
the
surrender
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
will
he
received
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
grant
commanding
armies
of
the
united
general
i
received
at
a
late
hour
your
note
of
in
answer
to
mine
of
yesterday
i
did
not
intend
to
propose
the
surrender
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
but
to
ask
the
terms
of
your
proposition
to
be
frank
i
do
not
think
the
emergency
has
arisen
to
call
for
the
surrender
but
as
the
restoration
of
peace
should
be
the
sole
object
of
all
i
desire
to
know
whether
your
proposals
would
tend
to
that
end
i
can
not
therefore
meet
you
with
a
view
to
surrender
the
army
of
northern
virginia
but
so
far
as
your
proposition
may
affect
the
confederate
states
forces
under
my
command
and
tend
to
the
restoration
of
peace
i
should
be
pleased
to
meet
you
at
on
the
old
to
richmond
between
the
of
the
two
armies
very
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
lee
to
grant
armies
of
the
united
illustration
last
council
of
war
no
reply
was
received
to
this
last
communication
from
general
lee
on
the
evening
of
the
and
that
night
there
was
held
around
a
in
the
woods
the
last
council
of
war
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
the
scene
was
a
very
picturesque
one
the
red
glare
from
the
lit
up
the
group
and
brought
out
the
details
of
each
figure
none
were

generals
gordon
and

half
reclined
upon
an
near
the
fire
longstreet
sat
upon
a
log
smoking
and
general
lee
stood
by
the
fire
holding
in
his
hand
the
correspondence
which
had
passed
between
himself
and
general
grant
the
question
what
course
it
was
advisable
to
pursue
was
then
presented
in
a
few
calm
words
by
general
lee
to
his
corps
commanders
and
an
informal
conversation
ensued
it
was
finally
agreed
that
the
army
should
advance
on
the
next
morning
beyond
appomattox
and
if
only
general
sheridan
cavalry
were
found
in

brush
that
force
from
its
path
and
proceed
on
its
way
to
lynchburg
if
however
the
federal
infantry
was
discovered
in
large
force
beyond
the
the
attempt
to
break
through
was
to
be
abandoned
and
a
flag
dispatched
to
general
grant
requested
an
interview
for
the
arrangement
of
the
terms
of
a
capitulation
of
the
southern
army
with
a
heavy
heart
general
lee
acquiesced
in
this
plan
of
proceeding
and
soon
afterward
the
council
of
war
terminated
the
corps
commanders
saluting
the
who
returned
their
bows
with
grave
courtesy
and
separating
to
return
to
their
own
bivouacs
in
spite
however
of
the
discouraging
and
almost
desperate
condition
of
affairs
general
lee
seems
still
to
have
clung
to
the
hope
that
he
might
be
able
to
cut
his
way
through
the
force
in
his
front
he
woke
from
brief
slumber
beside
his
at
about
three
in
the
morning
and
calling
an
officer
of
his
staff
colonel
venable
sent
him
to
general
gordon
commanding
the
front
to
ascertain
his
opinion
at
that
moment
of
the
probable
result
of
an
attack
upon
the
enemy
general
gordon
reply
was
tell
general
lee
that
my
old
corps
is
reduced
to
a
frazzle
and
unless
i
am
supported
by
longstreet
heavily
i
do
not
think
we
can
do
any
thing
more
general
lee
received
this
announcement
with
an
expression
of
great
feeling
and
after
a
moment
silence
said
there
is
nothing
left
but
to
go
to
general
grant
and
i
would
rather
die
a
thousand
deaths
his
had
now
gathered
around
him
and
one
of
them
said
what
will
history
say
of
our
surrendering
if
there
is
any
possibility
of
escape
posterity
will
not
understand
it
to
these
words
general
lee
replied
yes
yes
they
will
not
understand
our
situation
but
that
is
not
the
question
the
question
is
whether
it
is
and
if
it
is
right
i
take
the
responsibility
his
expression
of
buoyant
hopefulness
had
now
changed
to
one
of
deep
melancholy
and
it
was
evident
to
those
around
him
that
the
thought
of
surrender
was
worse
to
him
than
the
bitterness
of
death
for
the
first
time
his
courage
seemed
to
give
way
and
he
was
nearly
unmanned
turning
to
an
officer
standing
near
him
he
said
his
deep
voice
filled
with
hopeless
sadness
how
easily
i
could
get
rid
of
this
and
be
at
rest
i
have
only
to
ride
along
the
line
and
all
will
be
over
he
was
silent
for
a
short
time
after
uttering
these
words
and
then
added
with
a
heavy
sigh
but
it
is
our
duty
to
live
what
will
become
of
the
women
and
children
of
the
south
if
we
are
not
here
to
protect
them
the
moment
had
now
come
when
the
fate
of
the
retreat
was
to
be
decided
to
general
gordon
who
had
proved
himself
in
the
last
operations
of
the
war
a
soldier
of
the
first
ability
had
been
intrusted
the
command
of
the
advance
force
and
this
was
now
moved
forward
against
the
enemy
beyond
appomattox
gordon
attacked
with
his
infantry
supported
by
fitz
lee
cavalry
and
the
artillery
battalion
of
colonel
carter
and
such
was
the
impetuosity
of
his
advance
that
he
drove
the
federal
forces
nearly
a
mile
but
at
that
point
he
found
himself
in
face
of
a
body
of
infantry
stated
afterward
by
federal
officers
to
number
about
eighty
thousand
as
his
own
force
was
less
than
five
thousand
muskets
he
found
it
impossible
to
advance
farther
and
the
federal
lines
were
already
pressing
forward
to
attack
him
in
overwhelming
force
when
the
movement
suddenly
ceased
seeing
the
hopelessness
of
further
resistance
general
lee
had
sent
a
flag
to
general
grant
requesting
an
interview
looking
to
the
arrangement
if
possible
of
terms
of
surrender
and
to
this
end
the
forward
movement
of
the
federal
forces
was
ordered
to
be
discontinued
the
two
armies
then
remained
facing
each
other
during
the
interview
between
the
two
commanders
which
took
place
in
a
in
appomattox
general
lee
was
accompanied
only
by
colonel
marshall
of
his
staff
and
on
the
federal
side
only
a
few
officers
were
present
general
grant
demeanor
was
courteous
and
that
of
general
lee
unmarked
by
emotion
of
any
description
the
hardships
of
the
retreat
had
somewhat
impaired
his
strength
and
his
countenance
exhibited
traces
of
fatigue
but
no
other
change
had
taken
place
in
his
appearance
he
was
erect
calm
courteous
and
confined
his
observations
strictly
to
the
disagreeable
business
before
him
the
interview
was
brief
and
seated
at
a
plain
table
the
two
commanders
wrote
and
exchanged
the
accompanying
papers
appomattox

in
accordance
with
the
substance
of

your

the
two
generals
then
bowed
to
each
other
and
leaving
the
house
general
lee
mounted
his
gray
and
rode
back
to
his
headquarters
the
scene
as
he
passed
through
the
army
was
affecting
the
men
gathered
round
him
wrung
his
hand
and
in
broken
words
called
upon
god
to
help
him
this
pathetic
reception
by
his
old
soldiers
profoundly
affected
lee
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
and
looking
at
the
men
with
a
glance
of
proud
feeling
he
said
in
suppressed
tones
which
trembled
slightly
we
have
fought
through
the
war
together
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
for
you
my
heart
is
too
full
to
say
more
these
few
words
seemed
to
be
all
he
could
utter
he
rode
on
and
reaching
his
headquarters
in
the
woods
disappeared
in
his
tent
whither
we
shall
not
follow
him
on
the
next
day
the

of

numbering
about
thousand

day

the
capitulation
of

army
issued
an
address
to

they
received

with

after
four
years
of
arduous
service
marked
by
unsurpassed
courage
and
fortitude
the
army
of
northern
virginia
has
been
compelled
to
yield
to
overwhelming
numbers
and
resources
i
need
not
tell
the
survivors
of
so
many
battles
who
have
remained
steadfast
to
the
last
that
i
have
consented
to
this
result
from
no
distrust
of
them
but
feeling
that
valor
and
devotion
could
accomplish
nothing
that
could
compensate
for
the
loss
that
would
have
attended
the
continuation
of
the
contest
i
have
determined
to
avoid
the
useless
sacrifice
of
those
whose
past
services
have
endeared
them
to
their
countrymen
by
the
terms

return

remain
there
until

you
will
take
with
you
the
satisfaction
that
proceeds
from
the
consciousness
of
duty
faithfully
performed
and
i
earnestly
pray
that
a
merciful
god
will
extend
to
you
his
blessing
and
protection
with

unceasing
admiration

i
bid
you
an
affectionate
farewell
lee
the
painful
arrangements
connected
with
the
capitulation
were
on
this
day
concluded
and
general
lee
prepared
to
set
out
on
his
return
to
richmond
like
his
men
a
paroled
prisoner
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
the
parting
between
him
and
his
soldiers
was
pathetic
he
exchanged
with
all
near
him
a
close
pressure
of
the
hand
uttered
a
few
simple
words
of
farewell
and
mounting
his
traveller
who
had
passed
through
all
the
fighting
of
the
campaign
unharmed
rode
slowly
in
the
direction
of
richmond
he
was
escorted
by
a
detachment
of
federal
cavalry
preceded
only
by
a
guidon
and
the
party
including
the
officers
who
accompanied
him
consisted
of
about
horsemen
the
was
followed
by
several
wagons
carrying
the
private
effects
of
himself
and
his
companions
and
by
the
old
black
open
vehicle
which
he
had
occasionally
used
during
the
campaigns
of
the
preceding
year
when
indisposition
prevented
him
from
mounting
his
horse
in
this
vehicle
it
had
been
his
custom
to
carry
stores
for
the
wounded
it
had
never
been
used
for
articles
contributing
to
his
personal
convenience
general
lee
demeanor
on
his
way
to
richmond
was
entirely
composed
and
his
thoughts
seemed
much
more
occupied
by
the
unfortunate
condition
of
the
poor
people
at
whose
houses
he
stopped
than
by
his
own
situation
when
he
found
that
all
along
his
route
the
impoverished
people
had
cooked
provisions
in
readiness
for
him
and
were
looking
anxiously
for
him
with
every
indication
of
love
and
admiration
he
said
to
one
of
his
officers
these
good
people
are
kind
too
kind
their
hearts
are
as
full
as
when
we
began
our
first
campaigns
in
they
do
too
much
more
than
they
are
able
to
do
for
us
his
soldierly
habits
remained
unchanged
and
he
seemed
unwilling
to
indulge
in
any
luxuries
or
comforts
which
could
not
be
shared
by
the
gentlemen
accompanying
him
at
a
house
which
he
reached
just
as
night
came
a
poor
woman
had
prepared
an
excellent
bed
for
him
but
with
a
courteous
shake
of
the
head
he
spread
his
blanket
and
slept
upon
the
floor
stopping
on
the
next
day
at
the
house
of
his
brother
charles
carter
lee
in
powhatan
he
spent
the
evening
in
conversation
but
when
bedtime
came
left
the
house
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
had
begun
to
rain
and
crossing
the
road
into
the
woods
took
up
his
quarters
for
the
night
on
the
hard
planks
of
his
old
black
vehicle
on
the
route
he
exhibited
great
solicitude
about
a
small
quantity
of
oats
which
he
had
brought
with
him
in
one
of
the
wagons
for
his
old
companion
traveller
mentioning
it
more
than
once
and
appearing
anxious
lest
it
should
be
lost
or
used
by
some
one
illustration
lee

after

the
party
came
in
sight
of
richmond
at
last
and
two
or
three
miles
from
the
city
general
lee
rode
ahead
of
his
escort
accompanied
only
by
a
few
officers
and
crossing
the
pontoon
bridge
below
the
ruins
of
mayo
bridge
which
had
been
destroyed
when
the
confederate
forces
retreated
entered
the
capital
the
spectacle
which
met
his
eyes
at
this
moment
must
have
been
exceedingly
painful
in
the
great
conflagration
which
had
taken
place
on
the
morning
of
the
of
april
a
large
portion
of
the
city
had
been
burned
and
as
general
lee
rode
up
main
street
formerly
so
handsome
and
attractive
he
saw
on
either
hand
only
masses
of
blackened
ruins
as
he
rode
slowly
through
the
opening
between
these
masses
of
he
was
recognized
by
the
few
persons
who
were
on
the
street
and
instantly
the
intelligence
of
his
presence
spread
through
the
city
the
inhabitants
hastened
from
their
houses
and
flocked
to
welcome
him
saluting
him
with
cheers
and
the
waving
of
hats
and
handkerchiefs
he
seemed
desirous
however
of
avoiding
this
ovation
and
returning
the
greeting
by
simply
raising
his
hat
rode
on
and
reached
his
house
on
franklin
street
where
respecting
his
desire
for
privacy
under
circumstances
so
painful
his
admirers
did
not
intrude
upon
him
we
have
presented
this
brief
narrative
of
the
incidents
attending
general
lee
return
to
his
home
after
the
surrender
to
show
with
what
simplicity
and
good
sense
he
accepted
his
trying
situation
a
small
amount
of
diplomacy
sending
forward
one
of
his
officers
to
announce
his
intended
arrival
stopping
for
a
few
moments
as
he
ascended
main
street
making
an
address
to
the
citizens
who
first
recognized
him
and
thus
affording
time
for
a
crowd
to
assemble
these
proceedings
on
the
part
of
general
lee
would
have
resulted
in
an
ovation
such
as
a
vanquished
commander
never
before
received
at
the
hands
of
any
people
nothing
however
was
less
desired
by
general
lee
than
this
tumultuous
reception
the
native
modesty
of
the
man
not
only
shrunk
from
such
an
ovation
he
avoided
it
for
another
reason
the
pretext
it
would
probably
afford
to
the
federal
authorities
to
proceed
to
harsh
measures
against
the
unfortunate
persons
who
took
part
in
it
in
accordance
with
these
sentiments
general
lee
had
not
announced
his
coming
had
not
stopped
as
he
rode
through
the
city
and
now
shutting
himself
up
in
his
house
signified
his
desire
to
avoid
a
public
reception
and
to
be
left
in
privacy
this
policy
he
is
well
known
to
have
pursued
from
that
time
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
uniformly
declined
with
great
courtesy
but
firmly
invitations
to
attend
public
gatherings
of
any
description
where
his
presence
might
arouse
passions
or
occasion
discussions
connected
with
the
great
contest
in
which
he
had
been
the
leader
of
the
south
a
mind
less
firm
and
noble
would
doubtless
have
yielded
to
this
great
temptation
it
is
sweet
to
the
soldier
who
has
been
overwhelmed
and
has
yielded
up
his
sword
to
feel
that
the
love
and
admiration
of
a
people
still
follow
him
and
to
have
the
consolation
of
receiving
public
evidences
of
this
unchanged
devotion
that
this
love
of
the
southern
people
for
lee
deeply
touched
him
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
it
did
not
blind
him
to
his
duty
as
the
representative
individual
of
the
south
feeling
that
nothing
was
now
left
the
southern
people
but
an
honest
acceptance
of
the
situation
and
a
cessation
as
far
as
possible
of
all
rancor
toward
the
north
he
refused
to
encourage
sentiments
of
hostility
between
the
two
sections
and
did
all
in
his
power
to
restore
amicable
feeling
i
am
very
glad
to
learn
he
said
in
a
note
to
the
present
writer
that
your
life
of
general
jackson
is
of
the
character
you
describe
i
think
all
topics
or
questions
calculated
to
excite
angry
discussion
or
hostile
feelings
should
be
avoided
these
few
words
convey
a
distinct
idea
of
general
views
and
feelings
he
had
fought
to
the
best
of
his
ability
for
southern
independence
of
the
north
the
south
had
failed
in
the
struggle
and
it
was
now
in
his
opinion
the
duty
of
every
good
citizen
to
frankly
acquiesce
in
the
result
and
endeavor
to
avoid
all
that
kept
open
the
bleeding
wounds
of
the
country
his
military
career
had
placed
him
in
the
estimation
of
the
first
men
of
his
time
among
the
greatest
soldiers
of
history
but
the
dignity
and
moderation
of
the
course
pursued
by
him
from
the
end
of
the
war
to
the
time
of
his
death
will
probably
remain
in
the
opinion
of
both
his
friends
and
enemies
the
noblest
illustration
of
the
character
of
the
man
xviii
general
lee
after
the
war
in
the
concluding
pages
of
this
volume
we
shall
not
be
called
upon
to
narrate
either
military
or
political
events
with
the
surrender
at
appomattox
the
confederate
war
ended
no
attempt
was
made
by
general
johnston
or
other
commanders
to
prolong
it
in
that
great
whirlpool
all
hopes
of
further
resistance
disappeared
we
have
therefore
now
no
task
before
us
but
to
follow
general
lee
into
private
life
and
present
a
few
details
of
his
latter
years
and
his
death
these
notices
will
be
brief
but
will
not
we
hope
be
devoid
of
interest
the
soldier
who
had
so
long
led
the
confederate
armies
was
to
enter
in
his
latter
days
upon
a
new
field
of
labor
and
if
in
this
field
he
won
no
new
glories
he
at
least
displayed
the
loftiest
virtues
and
exhibited
that
rare
combination
of
greatness
and
gentleness
which
makes
up
a
character
altogether
lovely
adhering
to
the
resolution
formed
in
never
again
to
draw
his
sword
except
in
defence
of
virginia
general
lee
after
the
surrender
sought
for
some
occupation
feeling
the
necessity
doubtless
of
in
some
manner
employing
his
energies
he
is
said
to
have
had
offered
to
him
but
to
have
courteously
declined
estates
in
england
and
ireland
and
to
have
also
declined
the
place
of
commercial
agent
of
the
south
in
new
york
which
would
have
proved
exceedingly
lucrative
in
the
summer
of
however
he
accepted
an
offer
more
congenial
to
his
feelings
that
of
the
presidency
of
washington
college
at
lexington
and
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
entered
upon
his
duties
which
he
continued
to
perform
with
great
energy
and
success
to
the
day
of
his
death
of
the
excellent
judgment
and
great
administrative
capacity
which
he
displayed
in
this
new
field
of
labor
we
have
never
heard
any
question
it
was
the
name
and
example
however
of
lee
which
proved
so
valuable
drawing
to
the
college
more
than
five
hundred
students
from
all
portions
of
the
south
and
some
even
from
the
north
upon
the
subject
of
general
lee
life
at
washington
college
a
more
important
authority
than
that
of
the
present
writer
will
soon
speak
in
the
memorial
volume
whose
publication
will
probably
precede
or
immediately
follow
the
appearance
of
this
work
full
details
will
no
doubt
be
presented
of
this
interesting
period
the
subject
possesses
rare
interest
and
the
facts
presented
will
beyond
all
question
serve
to
bring
out
new
beauties
in
a
character
already
regarded
with
extraordinary
love
and
admiration
by
men
of
all
parties
and
opinions
to
the
volume
in
question
we
refer
the
reader
who
desires
the
portrait
of
one
concerning
whom
too
much
can
not
be
written
during
the
period
extending
between
the
end
of
the
war
and
general
lee
death
he
appeared
in
public
but
two
or
three
times
once
at
washington
as
a
witness
before
a
congressional
committee
styled
the
reconstruction
committee
to
inquire
into
the
condition
of
things
in
the
south
again
as
a
witness
on
the
proposed
trial
of
president
davis
and
perhaps
on
one
or
two
additional
occasions
not
of
great
interest
or
importance
his
testimony
was
not
taken
on
the
trial
of
the
president
which
was
deferred
and
finally
abandoned
but
he
was
subjected
before
the
washington
committee
to
a
long
and
searching
examination
in
which
it
is
difficult
to
decide
whether
his
own
calmness
good
sense
and
outspoken
frankness
or
the
bad
taste
of
some
of
the
questions
prepounded
to
him
were
the
more
remarkable
as
the
testimony
of
general
lee
upon
this
occasion
presents
a
full
exposition
of
his
views
upon
many
of
the
most
important
points
connected
with
the
condition
of
the
south
and
the
reconstruction
policy
a
portion
of
the
newspaper
report
of
his
evidence
is
here
given
as
both
calculated
to
interest
the
reader
and
to
illustrate
the
subject
the
examination
of
general
lee
took
place
in
march
and
the
following
is
the
main
portion
of
it
general
robert
lee
sworn
and
examined
by
howard
question
where
is
your
present
residence
answer
lexington
q
how
long
have
you
resided
in
lexington
a
since
the
of
october
last
nearly
five
months
the
feeling
in
virginia
q
are
you
acquainted
with
the
state
of
feeling
among
what
we
call
secessionists
in
virginia
at
present
toward
the
government
of
the
united
states
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
i
have
been
living
very
retired
and
have
had
but
little
communication
with
politicians
i
know
nothing
more
than
from
my
own
observation
and
from
such
facts
as
have
come
to
my
knowledge
q
from
your
observation
what
is
your
opinion
as
to
the
loyalty
toward
the
government
of
the
united
states
among
the
secession
portion
of
the
people
of
that
state
at
this
time
a
so
far
as
has
come
to
my
knowledge
i
do
not
know
of
a
single
person
who
either
feels
or
contemplates
any
resistance
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
indeed
any
opposition
to
it
no
word
has
reached
me
to
either
purpose
q
from
what
you
have
observed
among
them
is
it
your
opinion
that
they
are
friendly
toward
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
that
they
will
coöperate
to
sustain
and
uphold
the
government
for
the
future
i
believe
that
they
entirely
acquiesce
in
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
so
far
as
i
have
heard
any
one
express
an
opinion
they
are
for
coöperating
with
president
johnson
in
his
policy
q
in
his
policy
in
regard
to
what
a
his
policy
in
regard
to
the
restoration
of
the
whole
country
i
have
heard
persons
with
whom
i
have
conversed
express
great
confidence
in
the
wisdom
of
his
policy
of
restoration
and
they
seem
to
look
forward
to
it
as
a
hope
of
restoration
q
how
do
they
feel
in
regard
to
that
portion
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
who
have
been
forward
and
zealous
in
the
prosecution
of
the
war
against
the
rebellion
a
well
i
do
know
as
i
have
heard
anybody
express
any
opinion
in
regard
to
it
as
i
said
before
i
have
not
had
much
communication
with
politicians
in
the
country
if
there
are
any
every
one
seems
to
be
engaged
in
his
own
affairs
and
endeavoring
to
restore
the
civil
government
of
the
state
i
have
heard
no
expression
of
a
sentiment
toward
any
particular
portion
of
the
country
q
how
do
the
secessionists
feel
in
regard
to
the
payment
of
the
debt
of
the
united
states
contracted
in
the
prosecution
of
the
war
i
have
never
heard
anyone
speak
on
the
subject
i
suppose
they
must
expect
to
pay
the
taxes
levied
by
the
government
i
have
heard
them
speak
in
reference
to
the
payment
of
taxes
and
of
their
efforts
to
raise
money
to
pay
taxes
which
i
suppose
are
for
their
share
of
the
debt
i
have
never
heard
any
one
speak
in
opposition
to
the
payment
of
taxes
or
of
resistance
to
their
payment
their
whole
effort
has
been
to
try
and
raise
the
money
for
the
payment
of
the
taxes
the
debt
q
from
your
knowledge
of
the
state
of
public
feeling
in
virginia
is
it
your
opinion
that
the
people
would
if
the
question
were
left
to
them
repudiate
and
reject
that
debt
i
never
heard
any
one
speak
on
that
subject
but
from
my
knowledge
of
the
people
i
believe
that
they
would
be
in
favor
of
the
payment
of
all
just
debts
q
do
they
in
your
opinion
regard
that
as
a
just
debt
i
do
not
know
what
their
opinion
is
on
the
subject
of
that
particular
debt
i
have
never
heard
any
opinion
expressed
contrary
to
it
indeed
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
i
have
had
very
little
discussion
or
intercourse
with
the
people
i
believe
the
people
will
pay
the
debts
they
are
called
upon
to
pay
i
say
that
from
my
knowledge
of
the
people
generally
q
would
they
pay
that
debt
or
their
portion
of
it
with
as
much
alacrity
as
people
ordinarily
pay
their
taxes
to
their
government
i
do
not
know
that
they
would
make
any
distinction
between
the
two
the
taxes
laid
by
the
government
so
far
as
i
know
they
are
prepared
to
pay
to
the
best
of
their
ability
i
never
heard
them
make
any
distinction
q
what
is
the
feeling
of
that
portion
of
the
people
of
virginia
in
regard
to
the
payment
of
the
confederate
debt
i
believe
so
far
as
my
opinion
goes
i
have
no
facts
to
go
upon
but
merely
base
my
opinion
on
the
knowledge
i
have
of
the
people
that
they
would
be
willing
to
pay
the
confederate
debt
too
q
you
think
they
would
i
think
they
would
if
they
had
the
power
and
ability
to
do
so
i
have
never
heard
any
one
in
the
state
with
whom
i
have
conversed
speak
of
repudiating
any
debt
i
suppose
the
confederate
debt
is
almost
entirely
valueless
even
in
the
market
in
virginia
a
entirely
so
as
far
as
i
know
i
believe
the
people
generally
look
upon
it
as
lost
entirely
i
never
heard
any
question
on
the
subject
q
do
you
recollect
the
terms
of
the
confederate
bonds
when
they
were
made
payable
i
think
i
have
a
general
recollection
that
they
were
made
payable
six
months
after
a
declaration
of
peace
q
six
months
after
the
ratification
of
a
treaty
of
peace
between
the
united
states
and
the
confederate
government
i
think
they
ran
that
way
q
so
that
the
bonds
are
not
due
yet
by
their
terms
i
suppose
unless
it
is
considered
that
there
is
a
peace
now
they
are
not
due
the
freedmen
q
how
do
the
people
of
virginia
secessionists
more
particularly
feel
toward
the
freedmen
a
every
one
with
whom
i
associate
expresses
the
kindest
feelings
toward
the
freedmen
they
wish
to
see
them
get
on
in
the
world
and
particularly
to
take
up
some
occupation
for
a
living
and
to
turn
their
hands
to
some
work
i
know
that
efforts
have
been
made
among
the
farmers
near
where
i
live
to
induce
them
to
engage
for
the
year
at
regular
wages
q
do
you
think
there
is
a
willingness
on
the
part
of
their
old
masters
to
give
them
fair
living
wages
for
their
labor
i
believe
it
is
so
the
farmers
generally
prefer
those
servants
who
have
been
living
with
them
before
i
have
heard
them
express
their
preferences
for
the
men
whom
they
knew
who
had
lived
with
them
before
and
their
wish
to
get
them
to
return
to
work
q
are
you
aware
of
the
existence
of
any
combination
among
the
whites
to
keep
down
the
wages
of
the
blacks
i
am
not
i
have
heard
that
in
several
counties
the
have
met
in
order
to
establish
a
uniform
rate
of
wages
but
i
never
heard
nor
do
i
know
of
any
combination
to
keep
down
wages
or
establish
any
rule
which
they
did
not
think
fair
the
means
of
paying
wages
in
virginia
are
very
limited
now
and
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
how
much
each
person
is
able
to
pay
q
how
do
they
feel
in
regard
to
the
education
of
the
blacks
is
there
a
general
willingness
to
have
them
educated
a
where
i
am
and
have
been
the
people
have
exhibited
a
willingness
that
the
blacks
should
be
educated
and
they
express
an
opinion
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
blacks
and
better
for
the
whites
q
general
you
are
very
competent
to
judge
of
the
capacity
of
black
men
for
acquiring
knowledge
i
want
your
opinion
on
that
capacity
as
compared
with
the
capacity
of
white
men
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
particularly
qualified
to
speak
on
that
subject
as
you
seem
to
intimate
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
black
man
is
as
capable
of
acquiring
knowledge
as
the
white
man
there
are
some
more
apt
than
others
i
have
known
some
to
acquire
knowledge
and
skill
in
their
trade
or
profession
i
have
had
servants
of
my
own
who
learned
to
read
and
write
very
well
q
do
they
show
a
capacity
to
obtain
knowledge
of
mathematics
and
the
exact
sciences
i
have
no
knowledge
on
that
subject
i
am
merely
acquainted
with
those
who
have
learned
the
common
rudiments
of
education
q
general
are
you
aware
of
the
existence
among
the
blacks
of
virginia
anywhere
within
the
limits
of
the
state
of
combinations
having
in
view
the
disturbance
of
the
peace
or
any
improper
or
unlawful
acts
i
am
not
i
have
seen
no
evidence
of
it
and
have
heard
of
none
wherever
i
have
been
they
have
been
quiet
and
orderly
not
disposed
to
work
or
rather
not
disposed
to
any
continuous
engagement
to
work
but
just
very
short
jobs
to
provide
them
with
the
immediate
means
of
subsistence
q
has
the
colored
race
generally
as
great
love
of
money
and
property
as
the
white
race
possesses
i
do
not
think
it
has
the
blacks
with
whom
i
am
acquainted
look
more
to
the
present
time
than
to
the
future
q
does
that
absence
of
a
lust
of
money
and
property
arise
more
from
the
nature
of
the
negro
than
from
his
former
servile
condition
a
well
it
may
be
in
some
measure
attributed
to
his
former
condition
they
are
an
amiable
social
race
they
like
their
ease
and
comfort
and
i
think
look
more
to
their
present
than
to
their
future
condition
in
case
of
war
would
virginia
join
our
enemies
q
in
the
event
of
a
war
between
the
united
states
and
any
foreign
power
such
as
england
or
france
if
there
should
be
held
out
to
the
secession
portion
of
the
people
of
virginia
or
the
other
recently
rebel
states
a
fair
prospect
of
gaining
their
independence
and
shaking
off
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
it
or
is
it
not
your
opinion
that
they
would
avail
themselves
of
that
opportunity
i
can
not
answer
with
any
certainty
on
that
point
i
do
not
know
how
far
they
might
be
actuated
by
their
feelings
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
base
an
opinion
upon
so
far
as
i
know
they
contemplate
nothing
of
the
kind
now
what
may
happen
in
the
future
i
can
not
say
q
do
you
not
frequently
hear
in
your
intercourse
with
secessionists
in
virginia
expressions
of
a
hope
that
such
a
war
may
break
out
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
heard
it
on
the
contrary
i
have
heard
persons
i
do
not
know
whether
you
could
call
them
secessionists
or
not
i
mean
those
people
in
virginia
with
whom
i
associate
express
the
hope
that
the
country
may
not
be
led
into
a
war
q
in
such
an
event
do
you
not
think
that
that
class
of
people
whom
i
call
secessionists
would
join
the
common
enemy
a
it
is
possible
it
depends
upon
the
feeling
of
the
individual
q
if
it
is
a
fair
question
you
may
answer
or
not
as
you
choose
what
in
such
an
event
might
be
your
choice
i
have
no
disposition
now
to
do
it
and
i
never
have
had
q
and
you
can
not
foresee
that
such
would
be
your
inclination
in
such
an
event
a
no
i
can
only
judge
from
the
past
i
do
not
know
what
circumstances
it
may
produce
i
can
not
pretend
to
foresee
events
so
far
as
i
know
the
feeling
of
the
people
of
virginia
they
wish
for
peace
q
during
the
civil
war
was
it
not
contemplated
by
the
government
of
the
confederacy
to
form
an
alliance
with
some
foreign
nation
if
possible
i
believe
it
was
their
wish
to
do
so
if
they
could
it
was
their
wish
to
have
the
confederate
government
recognized
as
an
independent
government
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
it
could
have
made
favorable
treaties
it
would
have
done
so
but
i
know
nothing
of
the
policy
of
the
government
i
had
no
hand
or
part
in
it
i
merely
express
my
own
opinion
q
the
question
i
am
about
to
put
to
you
you
may
answer
or
not
as
you
choose
did
you
take
an
oath
of
fidelity
or
allegiance
to
the
confederate
government
i
do
not
recollect
having
done
so
but
it
is
possible
that
when
i
was
commissioned
i
did
i
do
not
recollect
whether
it
was
required
if
it
was
required
i
took
it
or
if
it
had
been
required
i
would
have
taken
it
but
i
do
not
recollect
whether
it
was
or
not
q
by
mr
blow
in
reference
to
the
effect
of
president
policy
if
it
were
adopted
would
there
be
any
thing
like
a
return
of
the
old
feeling
i
ask
that
because
you
used
the
expression
acquiescing
in
the
result
i
believe
it
would
take
time
for
the
feelings
of
the
people
to
be
of
that
cordial
nature
to
the
government
they
were
formerly
q
do
you
think
that
their
preference
for
that
policy
arises
from
a
desire
to
have
peace
and
good
feeling
in
the
country
or
from
the
probability
of
their
regaining
political
power
president
johnson
policy
a
so
far
as
i
know
the
desire
of
the
people
of
the
south
it
is
for
restoration
of
their
civil
government
and
they
look
upon
the
policy
of
president
johnson
as
the
one
which
would
most
clearly
and
most
surely
reëstablish
it
condition
of
the
poorer
classes
q
do
you
see
any
change
among
the
poorer
classes
in
virginia
in
reference
to
industry
are
they
as
much
or
more
interested
in
developing
their
material
interests
than
they
were
i
have
not
observed
any
change
every
one
now
has
to
attend
to
his
business
for
his
support
q
the
poorer
classes
are
generally
hard
at
work
are
they
a
so
far
as
i
know
they
are
i
know
nothing
to
the
contrary
q
is
there
any
difference
in
their
relations
to
the
colored
people
is
their
prejudice
increased
or
diminished
i
have
noticed
no
change
so
far
as
i
do
know
the
feelings
of
all
the
people
of
virginia
they
are
kind
to
the
colored
people
i
have
never
heard
any
blame
attributed
to
them
as
to
the
present
condition
of
things
or
any
responsibility
q
there
are
very
few
colored
laborers
employed
i
suppose
a
those
who
own
farms
have
employed
more
or
less
one
or
two
colored
laborers
some
are
so
poor
that
they
have
to
work
themselves
q
can
capitalists
and
workingmen
from
the
north
go
into
any
portion
of
virginia
with
which
you
are
familiar
and
go
to
work
among
the
people
i
do
not
know
of
any
thing
to
prevent
them
their
peace
and
pleasure
there
would
depend
very
much
on
their
conduct
if
they
confined
themselves
to
their
own
business
and
did
not
interfere
to
provoke
controversies
with
their
neighbors
i
do
not
believe
they
would
be
molested
q
there
is
no
desire
to
keep
out
capital
a
not
that
i
know
of
on
the
contrary
they
are
very
anxious
to
get
capital
into
the
state
q
you
see
nothing
of
a
disposition
to
prevent
such
a
thing
i
have
seen
nothing
and
do
not
know
of
any
thing
as
i
said
before
the
manner
in
which
they
would
be
received
would
depend
entirely
upon
the
individuals
themselves
they
might
make
themselves
obnoxious
as
you
can
understand
q
by
mr
howard
is
there
not
a
general
dislike
of
northern
men
among
secessionists
i
suppose
they
would
prefer
not
to
associate
with
them
i
do
not
know
that
they
would
select
them
as
associates
q
do
they
avoid
and
ostracize
them
socially
a
they
might
avoid
them
they
would
not
select
them
as
associates
unless
there
was
some
reason
i
do
not
know
that
they
would
associate
with
them
unless
they
became
acquainted
i
think
it
probable
they
would
not
admit
them
into
their
social
circles
the
position
of
the
colored
race
q
by
mr
blow
what
is
the
position
of
the
colored
men
in
virginia
with
reference
to
persons
they
work
for
do
you
think
they
would
prefer
to
work
for
northern
or
southern
men
i
think
it
very
probable
they
would
prefer
the
northern
man
although
i
have
no
facts
to
go
upon
q
that
having
been
stated
very
frequently
in
reference
to
the
cotton
states
does
it
result
from
a
bad
treatment
on
the
part
of
the
resident
population
or
from
the
idea
that
they
will
be
more
fairly
treated
by
the
what
is
your
observation
in
that
respect
in
regard
to
virginia
i
have
no
means
of
forming
an
opinion
i
do
not
know
any
case
in
virginia
i
know
of
numbers
of
the
blacks
engaging
with
their
old
masters
and
i
know
of
many
to
prefer
to
go
off
and
look
for
new
homes
whether
it
is
from
any
dislike
of
their
former
masters
or
from
any
desire
to
change
or
they
feel
more
free
and
independent
i
know
the
material
interests
of
virginia
q
what
is
your
opinion
in
regard
to
the
material
interests
of
virginia
do
you
think
they
will
be
equal
to
what
they
were
before
the
rebellion
under
the
changed
aspect
of
affairs
a
it
will
take
a
long
time
for
them
to
reach
their
former
standard
i
think
that
after
some
years
they
will
reach
it
and
i
hope
exceed
it
but
it
can
not
be
immediately
in
my
opinion
q
it
will
take
a
number
of
years
a
it
will
take
a
number
of
years
i
think
q
on
the
whole
the
condition
of
things
in
virginia
is
hopeful
both
in
regard
to
its
material
interests
and
the
future
peace
of
the
country
i
have
heard
great
hopes
expressed
and
there
is
great
cheerfulness
and
willingness
to
labor
q
suppose
this
policy
of
president
johnson
should
be
all
you
anticipate
and
that
you
should
also
realize
all
that
you
expect
in
the
improvement
of
the
material
interests
do
you
think
that
the
result
of
that
will
be
the
gradual
restoration
of
the
old
feeling
a
that
will
be
the
natural
result
i
think
and
i
see
no
other
way
in
which
that
result
can
be
brought
about
q
there
is
a
fear
in
the
public
mind
that
the
friends
of
the
policy
in
the
south
adopt
it
because
they
see
in
it
the
means
of
repairing
the
political
position
which
they
lost
in
the
recent
contest
do
you
think
that
that
is
the
main
idea
with
them
or
that
they
merely
look
to
it
as
you
say
as
the
best
means
of
restoring
civil
government
and
the
peace
and
prosperity
of
their
respective
states
a
as
to
the
first
point
you
make
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
heard
any
person
speak
upon
it
i
never
heard
the
points
separated
i
have
heard
them
speak
generally
as
to
the
effect
of
the
policy
of
president
johnson
the
feeling
is
so
far
as
i
know
now
that
there
is
not
that
equality
extended
to
the
southern
states
which
is
enjoyed
by
the
north
q
you
do
not
feel
down
there
that
while
you
accept
the
result
we
are
as
generous
as
we
ought
to
be
under
the
circumstances
a
they
think
that
the
north
can
afford
to
be
generous
q
that
is
the
feeling
down
there
a
yes
and
they
think
it
is
the
best
policy
those
who
reflect
upon
the
subject
and
are
able
to
judge
i
understand
it
to
be
your
opinion
that
generosity
and
liberality
toward
the
entire
south
would
be
the
surest
means
of
regaining
their
good
opinion
a
yes
and
the
speediest
q
by
mr
howard
i
understand
you
to
say
generally
that
you
had
no
apprehension
of
any
combination
among
the
leading
secessionists
to
renew
the
war
or
any
thing
of
the
kind
i
have
no
reason
in
the
world
to
think
so
q
have
you
heard
that
subject
talked
over
among
any
of
the
politicians
a
no
sir
i
have
not
i
have
not
heard
that
matter
even
suggested
q
let
me
put
another
hypothetical
state
of
things
suppose
the
executive
government
of
the
united
states
should
be
held
by
a
president
who
like
buchanan
rejected
the
right
of
coercion
so
called
and
suppose
a
congress
should
exist
here
entertaining
the
same
political
opinions
thus
presenting
to
the
once
rebel
states
the
opportunity
to
again
secede
from
the
union
would
they
or
not
in
your
opinion
avail
themselves
of
that
opportunity
or
some
of
them
i
suppose
it
would
depend
upon
the
circumstances
existing
at
the
time
if
their
feelings
should
remain
embittered
and
their
affections
alienated
from
the
rest
of
the
states
i
think
it
very
probable
they
might
do
so
provided
they
thought
it
was
to
their
interests
q
do
you
not
think
that
at
the
present
time
there
is
a
feeling
of
dislike
toward
the
government
of
the
united
states
on
the
part
of
the
secessionists
i
do
not
know
that
there
is
any
dislike
i
think
it
is
probable
there
may
be
some
animosity
still
existing
among
the
people
of
the
south
q
is
there
not
a
feeling
of
disappointment
and
chagrin
at
the
result
of
the
war
i
think
that
at
the
time
they
were
disappointed
at
the
result
of
the
war
q
do
you
mean
to
be
understood
as
saying
that
there
is
not
a
condition
of
discontent
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
among
the
secessionists
generally
i
know
none
q
are
you
prepared
to
say
that
they
respect
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
loyal
people
of
the
united
states
so
much
at
the
present
time
as
to
perform
their
duties
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
states
faithfully
and
well
i
believe
that
they
will
perform
all
the
duties
that
they
are
required
to
perform
i
think
that
is
the
general
feeling
so
far
as
i
know
q
do
you
think
it
would
be
practicable
to
convict
a
man
in
virginia
of
treason
for
having
taken
part
in
this
rebellion
against
the
government
by
a
virginian
jury
without
packing
it
with
direct
reference
to
a
verdict
of
guilty
a
on
that
point
i
have
no
knowledge
and
i
do
not
know
what
they
would
consider
treason
against
the
united
states
if
you
refer
to
past
acts
howard
yes
sir
witness
i
have
no
knowledge
what
their
views
on
that
subject
in
the
past
are
q
you
understand
my
question
suppose
a
jury
was
impanelled
in
your
own
neighborhood
taken
by
lot
would
it
be
possible
to
convict
for
instance
jefferson
davis
for
having
levied
war
upon
the
united
states
and
thus
having
committed
the
crime
of
treason
i
think
it
is
very
probable
that
they
would
not
consider
he
had
committed
treason
their
views
of
treason
q
suppose
the
jury
should
be
clearly
and
plainly
instructed
by
the
court
that
such
an
act
of
war
upon
the
part
of
davis
or
any
other
leading
man
constituted
the
crime
of
treason
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
would
the
jury
be
likely
to
heed
that
instruction
and
if
the
facts
were
plainly
in
proof
before
them
convict
the
offender
i
do
not
know
sir
what
they
would
do
on
that
question
q
they
do
not
generally
suppose
that
it
was
treason
against
the
united
states
do
they
i
do
not
think
that
they
so
consider
it
q
in
what
light
would
they
view
it
what
would
be
their
excuse
or
justification
how
would
they
escape
in
their
own
mind
i
refer
to
the
past
i
am
referring
to
the
past
and
the
feelings
they
would
have
a
so
far
as
i
know
they
look
upon
the
action
of
the
state
in
withdrawing
itself
from
the
government
of
the
united
states
as
carrying
the
individuals
of
the
state
along
with
it
that
the
state
was
responsible
for
the
act
not
the
individuals
and
that
the
ordinance
of
secession
so
called
or
those
acts
of
the
state
which
recognized
a
condition
of
war
between
the
state
and
the
general
government
stood
as
their
justification
for
their
bearing
arms
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
yes
sir
i
think
they
would
consider
the
act
of
the
state
as
legitimate
that
they
were
merely
using
the
reserved
rights
which
they
had
a
right
to
do
q
state
if
you
please
and
if
you
are
disinclined
to
answer
the
question
you
need
not
do
so
what
your
own
personal
views
on
that
question
are
a
that
was
my
view
that
the
act
of
virginia
in
withdrawing
herself
from
the
united
states
carried
me
along
as
a
citizen
of
virginia
and
that
her
laws
and
her
acts
were
binding
on
me
q
and
that
you
felt
to
be
your
justification
in
taking
the
course
you
did
a
yes
sir
i
have
been
told
general
that
you
have
remarked
to
some
of
your
friends
in
conversation
that
you
were
rather
wheedled
or
cheated
into
that
course
by
politicians
i
do
not
recollect
ever
making
any
such
remark
i
do
not
think
i
ever
made
it
q
if
there
be
any
other
matter
about
which
you
wish
to
speak
on
this
occasion
do
so
freely
a
only
in
reference
to
that
last
question
you
put
to
me
i
may
have
said
and
may
have
believed
that
the
positions
of
the
two
sections
which
they
held
to
each
other
was
brought
about
by
the
politicians
of
the
country
that
the
great
masses
of
the
people
if
they
understood
the
real
question
would
have
avoided
it
but
not
that
i
had
been
individually
wheedled
by
the
politicians
q
that
is
probably
the
origin
of
the
whole
thing
i
may
have
said
that
but
i
do
not
even
recollect
that
but
i
did
believe
at
the
time
that
it
was
an
unnecessary
condition
of
affairs
and
might
have
been
avoided
if
forbearance
and
wisdom
had
been
practised
on
both
sides
q
you
say
that
you
do
not
recollect
having
sworn
allegiance
and
fidelity
to
the
confederate
government
i
do
not
recollect
it
nor
do
i
know
it
was
ever
required
i
was
regularly
commissioned
in
the
army
of
the
confederate
states
but
i
do
not
really
recollect
that
that
oath
was
required
if
it
was
required
i
have
no
doubt
i
took
it
or
if
it
had
been
required
i
would
have
taken
it
q
is
there
any
other
matter
which
you
desire
to
state
to
the
committee
a
no
sir
i
am
ready
to
answer
any
question
which
you
think
proper
to
put
to
me
negro
citizenship
q
how
would
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
be
received
by
the
secessionists
or
by
the
people
at
large
allowing
the
colored
people
or
certain
classes
of
them
to
exercise
the
right
of
voting
at
elections
i
think
so
far
as
i
can
form
an
opinion
in
such
an
event
they
would
object
q
they
would
object
to
such
an
amendment
a
yes
sir
q
suppose
an
amendment
should
nevertheless
be
adopted
conferring
on
the
blacks
the
right
of
suffrage
would
that
in
your
opinion
lead
to
scenes
of
violence
or
breaches
of
the
peace
between
the
two
races
in
virginia
i
think
it
would
excite
unfriendly
feelings
between
the
two
races
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
to
what
extent
it
would
go
but
that
would
be
the
result
q
are
you
acquainted
with
the
proposed
amendment
now
pending
in
the
senate
of
the
united
states
a
no
sir
i
am
not
i
scarcely
ever
read
a
paper
the
substance
of
the
proposed
amendment
was
here
explained
to
the
witness
by
mr
conkling
so
far
as
i
can
see
i
do
not
think
that
the
state
of
virginia
would
object
to
it
q
would
she
consent
under
any
circumstances
to
allow
the
black
people
to
vote
even
if
she
were
to
gain
a
large
number
of
representatives
in
congress
a
that
would
depend
upon
her
interests
if
she
had
the
right
of
determining
that
i
do
not
see
why
she
would
object
if
it
were
to
her
interest
to
admit
these
people
to
vote
that
might
overrule
any
other
objection
that
she
had
to
it
q
what
in
your
opinion
would
be
the
practical
result
do
you
think
that
virginia
would
consent
to
allow
the
negro
to
vote
i
think
that
at
present
she
would
accept
the
smaller
representation
i
do
not
know
what
the
future
may
develop
if
it
should
be
plain
to
her
that
these
persons
will
vote
properly
and
understandingly
she
might
admit
them
to
vote
q
by
mr
blow
do
you
not
think
it
would
turn
a
good
deal
in
the
cotton
states
upon
the
value
of
the
labor
of
the
black
people
upon
the
amount
which
they
produce
a
in
a
good
many
states
in
the
south
and
in
a
good
many
counties
in
virginia
if
the
black
people
were
allowed
to
vote
it
would
i
think
exclude
proper
representation
that
is
proper
intelligent
people
would
not
be
elected
and
rather
than
suffer
that
injury
they
would
not
let
them
vote
at
all
q
do
you
not
think
that
the
question
as
to
whether
any
southern
state
would
allow
the
colored
people
the
right
of
suffrage
in
order
to
increase
representation
would
depend
a
good
deal
on
the
amount
which
the
colored
people
might
contribute
to
the
wealth
of
the
state
in
order
to
secure
two
things
first
the
larger
representation
and
second
the
influence
desired
from
those
persons
voting
i
think
they
would
determine
the
question
more
in
reference
to
their
opinion
as
to
the
manner
in
which
those
votes
would
be
exercised
whether
they
consider
those
people
qualified
to
vote
my
own
opinion
is
that
at
this
time
they
can
not
vote
intelligently
and
that
giving
them
the
right
of
suffrage
would
open
the
door
to
a
good
deal
of
demagogism
and
lead
to
embarrassments
in
various
ways
what
the
future
may
prove
how
intelligent
they
may
become
with
what
eyes
they
may
look
upon
the
interests
of
the
state
in
which
they
may
reside
i
can
not
say
more
than
you
can
the
above
extract
presents
the
main
portion
of
general
testimony
and
is
certainly
an
admirable
exposition
of
the
clear
good
sense
and
frankness
of
the
individual
once
or
twice
there
is
obviously
an
of
dry
satire
as
in
his
replies
upon
the
subject
of
the
confederate
bonds
when
asked
whether
he
remembered
at
what
time
these
bonds
were
made
payable
he
replied
that
his
general
recollection
was
that
they
were
made
payable
six
months
after
a
declaration
of
peace
the
correction
was
at
once
made
by
his
interrogator
in
the
words
six
months
after
ratification
of
a
treaty
of
etc
i
think
they
ran
that
way
replied
general
lee
so
that
retorted
his
interrogator
the
bonds
are
not
yet
due
by
their
terms
general
lee
reply
was
i
suppose
it
is
considered
that
there
is
a
peace
now
they
are
not
this
seems
to
have
put
an
abrupt
termination
to
the
examination
on
that
point
to
the
question
whether
he
had
taken
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
confederate
government
he
replied
i
do
not
recollect
having
done
so
but
it
is
possible
that
when
i
was
commissioned
i
did
i
do
not
recollect
whether
it
was
required
if
it
was
required
i
took
it
or
if
it
had
been
required
i
would
have
taken
it
if
this
reply
of
general
lee
be
attentively
weighed
by
the
reader
some
conception
may
be
formed
of
the
bitter
pang
which
he
must
have
experienced
in
sending
in
as
he
did
to
the
federal
government
his
application
for
pardon
the
fact
can
not
be
concealed
that
this
proceeding
on
the
part
of
general
lee
was
a
subject
of
deep
regret
to
the
southern
people
but
there
can
be
no
question
that
his
motive
was
disinterested
and
noble
and
that
he
presented
in
so
doing
the
most
remarkable
evidence
of
the
true
greatness
of
his
character
he
had
no
personal
advantage
to
expect
from
a
pardon
cared
absolutely
nothing
whether
he
were
pardoned
or
not
and
to
one
so
proud
and
so
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
justice
of
the
cause
in
which
he
had
fought
to
appear
as
a
supplicant
must
have
been
inexpressibly
painful
he
nevertheless
took
this
mortifying
step
actuated
entirely
by
that
sense
of
duty
which
remained
with
him
to
the
last
overmastering
every
other
sentiment
of
his
nature
he
seems
in
this
as
in
many
other
things
to
have
felt
the
immense
import
of
his
example
the
old
soldiers
of
his
army
and
thousands
of
civilians
were
obliged
to
apply
for
amnesty
or
remain
under
civic
disability
brave
men
with
families
depending
upon
them
had
been
driven
to
this
painful
course
and
general
lee
seems
to
have
felt
that
duty
to
his
old
comrades
demanded
that
he
too
should
swallow
this
bitter
draught
and
share
their
humiliation
as
he
had
shared
their
dangers
and
their
glory
if
this
be
not
the
explanation
of
the
motives
controlling
general
lee
action
the
writer
is
unable
to
account
for
the
course
which
he
pursued
that
it
is
the
sole
explanation
the
writer
no
more
doubts
than
he
doubts
the
fact
of
his
own
existence
xix
general
lee
last
years
and
death
for
about
five
years
from
the
latter
part
of
nearly
to
the
end
of
general
lee
continued
to
concentrate
his
entire
attention
and
all
his
energies
upon
his
duties
as
president
of
washington
college
to
which
his
great
name
and
the
desire
of
southern
parents
to
have
their
sons
educated
under
a
guide
so
illustrious
attracted
as
we
have
said
more
than
five
hundred
students
the
sedentary
nature
of
these
occupations
was
a
painful
trial
to
one
so
long
accustomed
to
lead
a
life
of
activity
but
it
was
not
in
the
character
of
the
individual
to
allow
personal
considerations
to
interfere
with
the
performance
of
his
duty
and
the
laborious
supervision
of
the
education
of
this
large
number
of
young
gentlemen
continued
day
after
day
and
year
after
year
to
occupy
his
mind
and
his
time
to
the
exclusion
wellnigh
of
every
other
thought
his
personal
popularity
with
the
students
was
very
great
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
their
respect
for
him
was
unbounded
by
the
citizens
of
lexington
and
especially
the
graver
and
more
pious
portion
he
was
regarded
with
a
love
and
admiration
greater
than
any
felt
for
him
during
the
progress
of
his
military
career
this
was
attributable
doubtless
to
the
franker
and
clearer
exhibition
by
general
lee
in
his
latter
years
of
that
extraordinary
gentleness
and
sweetness
culminating
in
devoted
christian
piety
which
concealed
from
all
eyes
in
some
degree
during
the
war
now
plainly
revealed
themselves
and
were
evidently
the
broad
foundation
and
controlling
influences
of
his
whole
life
and
character
to
speak
first
of
his
gentleness
and
moderation
in
all
his
views
and
utterances
of
these
eminent
virtues
eminent
and
striking
above
all
in
a
defeated
soldier
with
so
much
to
embitter
him
general
lee
presented
a
very
remarkable
illustration
the
result
of
the
war
seemed
to
have
left
his
great
soul
calm
resigned
and
untroubled
by
the
least
rancor
while
others
not
more
devoted
to
the
south
permitted
passion
and
sectional
animosity
to
master
them
and
dictate
acts
and
expressions
full
of
bitterness
toward
the
north
general
lee
refrained
systematically
from
every
thing
of
that
description
and
by
simple
force
of
greatness
one
would
have
said
rose
above
all
prejudices
and
hatreds
of
the
hour
counselling
and
giving
in
his
own
person
to
all
who
approached
him
the
example
of
moderation
and
christian
charity
he
aimed
to
keep
alive
the
old
southern
traditions
of
honor
and
virtue
but
not
that
sectional
hatred
which
could
produce
only
evil
to
a
lady
who
had
lost
her
husband
in
the
war
and
on
bringing
her
two
sons
to
the
college
indulged
in
expressions
of
great
bitterness
toward
the
north
general
lee
said
gently
madam
do
not
train
up
your
children
in
hostility
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
remember
that
we
are
one
country
now
dismiss
from
your
mind
all
sectional
feeling
and
bring
them
up
to
be
americans
a
still
more
suggestive
exhibition
of
his
freedom
from
rancor
was
presented
in
an
interview
which
is
thus
described
one
day
last
autumn
the
writer
saw
general
lee
standing
at
his
gate
talking
pleasantly
to
an
man
who
seemed
very
much
pleased
at
the
cordial
courtesy
of
the
great
chieftain
and
turned
off
evidently
delighted
as
we
came
up
after
exchanging
salutations
the
general
said
pointing
to
the
retreating
form
is
one
of
our
old
soldiers
who
is
in
necessitous
circumstances
i
took
it
for
granted
that
it
was
some
veteran
confederate
when
the
chieftain
quietly
added
fought
on
the
other
side
but
we
must
not
think
of
that
i
afterward
ascertained
not
from
general
lee
for
he
never
alluded
to
his
charities
that
he
had
not
only
spoken
kindly
to
this
soldier
who
had
on
the
other
side
but
had
sent
him
on
his
way
rejoicing
in
a
liberal
contribution
to
his
necessities
of
the
extent
of
this
christian
moderation
another
proof
was
given
by
the
soldier
at
a
moment
when
he
might
not
unreasonably
have
been
supposed
to
labor
under
emotions
of
the
extremest
bitterness
soon
after
his
return
to
richmond
in
april
when
the
of
surrender
was
still
open
and
bleeding
a
gentleman
was
requested
by
the
federal
commander
in
the
city
to
communicate
to
general
lee
the
fact
that
he
was
about
to
be
indicted
in
the
united
states
courts
for
treason
in
acquitting
himself
of
his
commission
the
gentleman
expressed
sentiments
of
violent
indignation
at
such
a
proceeding
but
these
feelings
general
lee
did
not
seem
to
share
the
threat
of
arraigning
him
as
a
traitor
produced
no
other
effect
upon
him
than
to
bring
a
smile
to
his
lips
and
taking
the
hand
of
his
friend
as
the
latter
rose
to
go
he
said
in
his
mildest
tones
we
must
forgive
our
enemies
i
can
truly
say
that
not
a
day
has
passed
since
the
war
began
that
i
have
not
prayed
for
them
footnote
this
was
afterward
done
by
one
of
the
federal
judges
but
resulted
in
nothing
the
incidents
here
related
define
the
views
and
feelings
of
general
lee
as
accurately
as
they
could
be
set
forth
in
a
whole
volume
the
defeated
commander
who
could
open
his
poor
purse
to
one
of
old
soldiers
who
on
the
other
and
pray
daily
during
the
bitterest
of
conflicts
for
his
enemies
must
surely
have
trained
his
spirit
to
the
perfection
of
christian
charity
of
the
strength
and
controlling
character
of
general
lee
religious
convictions
we
have
more
than
once
spoken
in
preceding
pages
of
this
volume
these
now
seemed
to
exert
a
more
marked
influence
over
his
life
and
indeed
to
shape
every
action
and
utterance
of
the
man
during
the
war
he
had
exhibited
much
greater
reserve
upon
this
the
most
important
of
all
subjects
which
can
engage
the
attention
of
a
human
being
and
although
he
had
been
from
an
early
period
we
believe
a
communicant
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
he
seldom
discussed
religious
questions
or
spoke
of
his
own
feelings
presenting
in
this
a
marked
contrast
as
we
have
said
to
his
illustrious
associate
general
jackson
even
during
the
war
however
as
the
reader
has
seen
in
our
notices
of
his
character
at
the
end
of
general
lee
piety
revealed
itself
in
conversations
with
his
chaplains
and
other
good
men
and
was
not
concealed
from
the
troops
as
on
the
occasion
of
the
in
the
midst
of
the
fighting
at
mine
run
on
another
occasion
when
reviewing
his
army
near
winchester
he
was
seen
to
raise
his
hat
to
a
chaplain
with
the
words
i
salute
the
church
of
god
and
again
near
petersburg
was
observed
kneeling
in
prayer
a
short
distance
from
the
road
as
his
troops
marched
by
still
another
incident
of
the
period
that
of
the
war
will
be
recorded
here
in
the
words
of
the
rev
william
jones
who
relates
it
not
long
before
the
evacuation
of
petersburg
the
writer
was
one
day
distributing
tracts
along
the
trenches
when
he
perceived
a
brilliant
cavalcade
approaching
general
lee
accompanied
by
general
john
gordon
general
hill
and
other
general
officers
with
their
staffs
was
inspecting
our
lines
and
reconnoitring
those
of
the
enemy
the
keen
eye
of
gordon
recognized
and
his
cordial
grasp
detained
the
humble
as
he
warmly
inquired
about
his
work
general
lee
at
once
reined
in
his
horse
and
joined
in
the
conversation
the
rest
of
the
party
gathered
around
and
the
humble
colporteur
thus
became
the
centre
of
a
group
of
whose
notice
the
highest
princes
of
earth
might
well
be
proud
general
lee
asked
if
we
ever
had
calls
for
and
said
that
if
we
would
call
at
his
headquarters
he
would
give
us
some
for
distribution
some
friend
in
richmond
had
given
him
a
new
and
upon
his
saying
that
he
would
give
his
old
one
that
he
had
used
ever
since
the
mexican
war
to
some
soldier
the
friend
had
offered
him
a
dozen
new
books
for
the
old
one
and
he
had
of
course
accepted
so
good
an
offer
and
now
had
twelve
instead
of
one
to
give
away
we
called
at
the
appointed
hour
the
general
had
gone
out
on
some
important
matter
but
even
amid
his
pressing
duties
had
left
the
with
a
member
of
his
staff
with
instructions
concerning
them
he
had
written
on
the
of
each
by
lee
and
we
are
sure
that
those
of
the
gallant
men
to
whom
they
were
given
who
survive
the
war
will
now
cherish
them
as
precious
legacies
and
hand
them
down
as
heirlooms
in
their
families
these
incidents
unmistakably
indicate
that
general
lee
concealed
under
the
natural
reserve
of
his
character
an
earnest
religious
belief
and
trust
in
god
and
our
saviour
nor
was
this
a
new
sentiment
with
him
after
his
death
a
pocket
bible
was
found
in
his
chamber
in
which
was
written
lee
army
it
was
plain
from
this
that
even
during
the
days
of
his
earlier
manhood
in
mexico
and
on
the
western
prairies
he
had
read
his
bible
and
striven
to
conform
his
life
to
its
teachings
with
the
retirement
of
the
great
soldier
however
from
the
cares
of
command
which
necessarily
interfered
in
a
large
degree
with
pious
exercises
and
meditations
the
religious
phase
of
his
character
became
more
clearly
defined
assuming
far
more
prominent
and
striking
proportions
the
sufferings
of
the
southern
people
doubtless
had
a
powerful
effect
upon
him
and
feeling
the
powerlessness
of
man
he
must
have
turned
to
god
for
comfort
but
this
inquiry
is
too
profound
for
the
present
writer
he
shrinks
from
the
attempt
to
sound
the
depths
of
this
truly
great
soul
with
the
view
of
discovering
the
influences
which
moulded
it
into
an
almost
ideal
perfection
general
lee
was
fortunately
for
the
world
surrounded
in
his
latter
days
by
good
and
intelligent
men
fully
competent
to
present
a
complete
exposition
of
his
views
and
feelings
and
to
these
the
arduous
undertaking
is
left
our
easier
task
is
to
place
upon
record
such
incidents
as
we
have
gathered
bearing
upon
the
religious
phase
of
the
illustrious
soldier
character
his
earnest
piety
can
not
be
better
displayed
than
in
the
anxiety
which
he
felt
for
the
conversion
of
his
students
conversing
with
the
rev
kirkpatrick
of
the
presbyterian
church
on
the
subject
of
the
religious
welfare
of
those
intrusted
to
his
charge
he
was
so
overcome
by
emotion
says
kirkpatrick
that
he
could
not
utter
the
words
which
were
on
his
tongue
his
utterance
was
choked
but
recovering
himself
with
his
eyes
overflowing
with
tears
his
lips
quivering
with
emotion
and
both
hands
raised
he
exclaimed
oh
doctor
if
i
could
only
know
that
all
the
young
men
in
the
college
were
good
christians
i
should
have
nothing
more
to
desire
when
another
minister
the
rev
jones
delivered
an
earnest
address
at
the
concert
of
prayer
for
colleges
urging
that
all
christians
should
pray
for
the
aid
of
the
holy
spirit
in
changing
the
hearts
of
the
students
general
lee
after
the
meeting
approached
the
minister
and
said
with
great
warmth
i
wish
sir
to
thank
you
for
your
address
it
was
just
what
we
needed
our
great
want
is
a
revival
which
shall
bring
these
young
men
to
christ
one
morning
while
the
venerable
white
was
passing
general
house
on
his
way
to
chapel
the
general
joined
him
and
they
entered
into
conversation
upon
religious
subjects
general
lee
said
little
but
just
as
they
reached
the
college
stopped
and
remarked
with
great
earnestness
his
eyes
filling
with
tears
as
he
spoke
i
shall
be
disappointed
sir
i
shall
fail
in
the
leading
object
that
brought
me
here
unless
the
young
men
all
become
real
christians
and
i
wish
you
and
others
of
your
sacred
profession
to
de
all
you
can
to
accomplish
this
result
when
a
great
revival
of
religious
feeling
took
place
at
the
virginia
military
institute
in
general
lee
said
to
the
clergyman
of
his
church
with
deep
feeling
that
is
the
best
news
i
have
heard
since
i
have
been
in
lexington
would
that
we
could
have
such
a
revival
in
all
our
colleges
although
a
member
of
the
protestant
episcopal
church
and
preferring
that
communion
general
lee
seems
to
have
been
completely
exempt
from
sectarian
feeling
and
to
have
aimed
first
and
last
to
be
a
true
christian
loving
god
and
his
neighbor
and
not
busying
himself
about
theological
dogmas
when
he
was
asked
once
whether
he
believed
in
the
apostolic
succession
he
replied
that
he
had
never
thought
of
it
and
aimed
only
to
become
a
real
christian
his
catholic
views
were
shown
by
the
letters
of
invitation
which
he
addressed
at
the
commencement
of
each
session
of
the
college
to
ministers
of
all
religious
denominations
at
lexington
to
conduct
in
turn
the
religious
exercises
at
the
college
chapel
and
his
charities
which
were
large
for
a
person
of
his
limited
means
were
given
to
all
alike
these
charities
he
seems
to
have
regarded
as
a
binding
duty
and
were
so
private
that
only
those
receiving
them
knew
any
thing
of
them
it
only
came
to
be
known
accidentally
that
in
he
gave
one
hundred
dollars
for
the
education
of
the
orphans
of
southern
soldiers
one
hundred
dollars
to
the
young
men
christian
association
and
regularly
made
other
donations
amounting
in
all
to
considerable
sums
nearly
his
last
act
was
a
liberal
contribution
to
an
important
object
connected
with
his
church
we
shall
conclude
these
anecdotes
illustrating
general
religious
character
with
one
for
which
we
are
indebted
to
the
kindness
of
a
reverend
clergyman
of
lexington
who
knew
general
lee
intimately
in
his
latter
years
and
enjoyed
his
confidence
the
incident
will
present
in
an
agreeable
light
the
great
simplicity
and
love
for
children
and
no
less
his
catholic
feelings
in
reference
to
sects
in
the
christian
church
i
will
give
you
just
another
incident
writes
the
reverend
gentleman
illustrating
general
lee
love
for
children
and
their
freedom
with
him
when
i
first
came
to
lexington
my
boy
carter
just
four
years
old
then
used
to
go
with
me
to
chapel
service
when
it
was
my
turn
to
officiate
the
general
would
tell
him
that
he
must
always
sit
by
him
and
it
was
a
scene
for
a
painter
to
see
the
great
chieftain
reverentially
listening
to
the
truths
of
god
word
and
the
little
boy
nestling
close
to
him
one
sunday
our
superintendent
told
the
children
that
they
must
bring
in
some
new
scholars
and
that
they
must
bring
old
people
as
well
as
the
young
since
none
were
too
old
or
too
wise
to
learn
god
word
the
next
sabbath
carter
was
with
me
at
the
chapel
from
which
he
was
to
go
with
me
to
the
at
the
close
of
the
service
i
noticed
that
carter
was
talking
very
earnestly
with
general
lee
who
seemed
very
much
amused
and
on
calling
him
to
come
with
me
he
said
with
childish
simplicity
i
am
trying
to
get
general
lee
to
go
to
the
and
my
said
i
the
general
goes
to
any
school
he
will
go
to
his
own
is
his
own
father
episcopal
i
replied
heaving
a
deep
sigh
and
with
a
look
of
disappointment
the
little
fellow
said
am
very
sorry
he
is
i
wish
he
was
a
baptist
so
he
could
go
to
and
be
my
scholar
the
general
seemed
very
much
amused
and
interested
as
he
replied
carter
we
must
all
try
and
be
that
is
the
most
important
thing
knew
all
the
children
in
town
adds
jones
their
grief
at
his
death
was
very
touching
this
incident
may
appear
singular
to
those
who
have
been
accustomed
to
regard
general
lee
as
a
cold
reserved
and
even
stern
human
being
a
statue
beneath
whose
chill
surface
no
heart
ever
throbbed
but
instead
of
a
marble
heart
there
lay
under
the
gray
uniform
of
the
soldier
one
of
warm
flesh
and
blood
tender
impressible
susceptible
to
the
quick
touches
of
all
gentle
and
sweet
emotion
and
filling
as
it
were
with
quiet
happiness
at
the
sight
of
children
and
the
sound
of
their
voices
this
impressibility
has
even
been
made
the
subject
of
criticism
a
foreign
writer
declares
that
the
soldier
character
exhibited
a
feminine
softness
unfitting
him
for
the
conduct
of
affairs
of
moment
what
the
confederacy
wanted
intimates
the
writer
in
question
was
a
rough
dictator
with
little
regard
for
nice
questions
of
law
one
to
lay
the
rough
hand
of
the
born
master
on
the
helm
and
force
the
crew
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
to
obey
his
will
that
will
probably
remain
a
question
general
lee
was
strong
enough
to
break
down
all
obstacles
but
those
erected
by
rightful
authority
that
with
this
masculine
strength
he
united
an
exquisite
gentleness
is
equally
beyond
question
a
noble
action
flushed
his
cheek
with
an
emotion
that
the
reader
may
if
he
will
call
feminine
a
tale
of
suffering
brought
a
sudden
moisture
to
his
eyes
and
a
loving
message
from
one
of
his
poor
old
soldiers
was
seen
one
day
to
melt
him
to
tears
this
poor
and
incomplete
attempt
to
indicate
some
of
the
traits
of
the
illustrious
of
the
southern
armies
will
now
be
brought
to
a
conclusion
we
approach
the
sorrowful
moment
when
surrounded
by
his
weeping
family
he
tranquilly
passed
away
footnote
general
lee
had
three
sons
and
four
daughters
all
of
whom
are
living
except
one
of
the
latter
miss
anne
lee
who
died
in
north
carolina
during
the
war
the
sons
were
general
custis
lee
to
president
davis
subsequently
commander
of
infantry
in
the
field
and
now
president
of
washington
and
lee
college
an
officer
of
such
ability
and
of
character
so
eminent
that
president
davis
regarded
him
as
a
fit
successor
of
his
illustrious
father
in
command
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
general
lee
a
prominent
and
able
commander
of
cavalry
and
captain
robert
lee
an
efficient
member
of
the
these
gentlemen
bore
their
full
share
in
the
perils
and
hardships
of
the
war
from
its
commencement
to
the
surrender
at
appomattox
on
the
of
september
after
laborious
attention
to
his
duties
during
the
early
part
of
the
day
general
lee
attended
in
the
afternoon
a
meeting
of
the
vestry
of
grace
church
of
which
he
was
a
member
over
this
meeting
he
presided
and
it
was
afterward
remembered
that
his
last
public
act
was
to
contribute
the
sum
of
dollars
to
some
good
object
the
requisite
amount
to
effect
which
was
thus
made
up
after
the
meeting
general
lee
returned
to
his
home
and
when
tea
was
served
took
his
place
at
the
table
to
say
grace
as
was
his
habit
as
it
had
been
in
camp
throughout
the
war
his
lips
opened
but
no
sound
issued
from
them
and
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
from
which
he
was
carried
to
bed
the
painful
intelligence
immediately
became
known
throughout
lexington
and
the
utmost
grief
and
consternation
were
visible
upon
every
face
it
was
hoped
at
first
that
the
attack
would
not
prove
serious
and
that
general
lee
would
soon
be
able
to
resume
his
duties
but
this
hope
was
soon
dissipated
the
skilful
physicians
who
hastened
to
his
bedside
pronounced
his
malady
congestion
of
the
brain
and
from
the
appearance
of
the
patient
who
lay
in
a
species
of
coma
the
attack
was
evidently
of
the
most
alarming
character
the
most
discouraging
phase
of
the
case
was
that
physically
general
lee
was
if
we
may
so
say
in
perfect
health
his
superb
physique
although
not
perhaps
as
vigorous
and
robust
as
during
the
war
exhibited
no
indication
whatever
of
disease
his
health
appeared
perfect
and
twenty
years
more
of
life
might
have
been
predicted
for
him
from
simple
reference
to
his
appearance
the
malady
was
more
deeply
seated
however
than
any
bodily
disease
the
cerebral
congestion
was
but
a
symptom
of
the
mental
malady
which
was
killing
its
victim
from
the
testimony
of
the
able
physicians
who
watched
the
great
soldier
day
and
night
throughout
his
illness
and
are
thus
best
competent
to
speak
upon
the
subject
there
seems
no
doubt
that
general
lee
condition
was
the
result
of
mental
depression
produced
by
the
sufferings
of
the
southern
people
every
mail
it
is
said
had
brought
him
the
most
piteous
appeals
for
assistance
from
old
soldiers
whose
families
were
in
want
of
bread
and
the
woes
of
these
poor
people
had
a
prostrating
effect
upon
him
a
year
or
two
before
his
health
had
been
seriously
impaired
by
this
brooding
depression
and
he
had
visited
north
carolina
the
white
sulphur
springs
and
other
places
to
divert
his
mind
in
this
he
failed
the
shadow
went
with
him
and
the
result
was
at
last
the
alarming
attack
from
which
he
never
rallied
during
the
two
weeks
of
his
illness
he
scarcely
spoke
and
evidently
regarded
his
condition
as
hopeless
when
one
of
his
physicians
said
to
him
general
you
must
make
haste
and
get
well
has
been
standing
so
long
in
his
stable
that
he
needs
exercise
general
lee
shook
his
head
slowly
to
indicate
that
he
would
never
again
mount
his
favorite
horse
he
remained
in
this
state
with
few
alterations
in
his
condition
until
wednesday
october
when
about
nine
in
the
morning
in
the
midst
of
his
family
the
great
soldier
tranquilly
expired
of
the
universal
grief
of
the
southern
people
when
the
intelligence
was
transmitted
by
telegraph
to
all
parts
of
the
country
it
is
not
necessary
that
we
should
speak
the
death
of
lee
seemed
to
make
all
hearts
stand
still
and
the
tolling
of
bells
flags
at
and
public
meetings
of
citizens
wearing
mourning
marked
in
every
portion
of
the
south
the
sense
of
a
great
public
calamity
it
is
not
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
in
ten
thousand
southern
homes
tears
came
to
the
eyes
not
only
of
women
but
of
bearded
men
and
that
the
words
lee
is
dead
fell
like
a
upon
every
heart
when
the
intelligence
reached
richmond
the
legislature
passed
resolutions
expressive
of
the
general
sorrow
and
requesting
that
the
remains
of
general
lee
might
be
interred
in
holywood
cemetery
walker

governor
expressing
in
a
special
message
his
participation
in
the
grief
of
the
people
of
virginia
and
the
south
the
family
of
general
lee
however
preferred
that
his
remains
should
rest
at
the
scene
of
his
last
labors
and
beneath
the
chapel
of
washington
college
they
were
accordingly
interred
the
ceremony
was
imposing
and
will
long
be
remembered
on
the
morning
of
the
the
body
was
borne
to
the
college

in
front
moved
a
guard
of
honor
composed

which
was
led
the
dead
soldier

traveller
his
equipments
wreathed
with
crape
the
trustees
and
faculty
of
the
college
the
cadets
of
the
military
institute
and
a
large
number
of
citizens
followed
and
the
procession
moved
slowly
from
the
northeastern
gate
of
the
president
house
to
the
college
chapel
above
which
draped
in
mourning
and
at
floated
the
flag
of
virginia
the
only
one
displayed
during
this
or
any
other
portion
of
the
funeral
ceremonies
on
the
platform
of
the
chapel
the
body
lay
in
state
throughout
this
and
the
succeeding
day
the
coffin
was
covered
with
evergreens
and
flowers
and
the
face
of
the
dead
was
uncovered
that
all
might
look
for
the
last
time
on
the
pale
features
of
the
illustrious
soldier
the
body
was
dressed
in
a
simple
suit
of
black
and
the
appearance
of
the
face
was
perfectly
natural
great
crowds
visited
the
chapel
passing
solemnly
in
front
of
the
coffin
the
silence
interrupted
only
by
sobs
throughout
the
the
body
continued
to
be
in
state
and
to
be
visited
by
thousands
on
the
a
great
funeral
procession
preceded
the
commission
of
it
to
its
last
resting
place
at
an
early
hour
the
crowd
began
to
assemble
in
the
vicinity
of
the
college
which
was
draped
in
mourning
this
great
concourse
was
composed
of
men
women
and
children
all
wearing
crape
and
the
little
children
seemed
as
much
penetrated
by
the
general
distress
as
the
elders
the
bells
of
the
churches
began
to
toll
and
at
ten
the
students
of
the
college
and
officers
and
soldiers
of
the
confederate
army
numbering
together
nearly
one
thousand
persons
formed
in
front
of
the
chapel
between
the
two
bodies
stood
the
hearse
and
the
gray
horse
of
the
soldier
both
draped
in
mourning
the
procession
then
began
to
move
to
the
strains
of
martial
music
the
military
escort
together
with
the
of
general
lee
moved
in
front
the
faculty
and
students
followed
behind
the
hearse
and
in
rear
came
a
committee
of
the
legislative
dignitaries
of
the
commonwealth
and
a
great
multitude
of
citizens
from
all
portions
of
the
state
the
procession
continued
its
way
toward
the
institute
where
the
cadets
made
the
military
salute
as
the
hearse
passed
in
front
of
them
and
the
sudden
thunder
of
artillery
awoke
the
echoes
from
the
hills
the
cadets
then
joined
the
procession
which
was
more
than
a
mile
in
length
and
heralded
by
the
fire
of
artillery
every
few
minutes
it
moved
back
to
the
college
chapel
where
the
last
services
were
performed
general
lee
had
requested
it
is
said
that
no
funeral
oration
should
be
pronounced
above
his
remains
and
the
rev
william
pendleton
simply
read
the
beautiful
of
the
episcopal
church
the
coffin
still
covered
with
evergreens
and
flowers
was
then
lowered
to
its
beneath
the
chapel
amid
the
sobs
and
tears
of
the
great
assembly
and
all
that
was
mortal
of
the
illustrious
soldier
disappeared
from
the
world
eyes
what
thus
disappeared
was
little
what
remained
was
much
the
memory
of
the
virtues
and
the
glory
of
the
greatest
of
virginians
appendix
we
here
present
to
the
reader
a
more
detailed
account
of
the
ceremonies
attending
the
burial
of
general
lee
and
a
selection
from
the
countless
addresses
delivered
in
various
portions
of
the
country
when
his
death
was
announced
to
notice
the
honors
paid
to
his
memory
in
every
city
town
and
village
of
the
south
would
fill
a
volume
and
be
wholly
unnecessary
it
is
equally
unnecessary
to
speak
of
the
great
meetings
at
richmond
baltimore
and
elsewhere
resulting
in
the
formation
of
the
lee
memorial
association
for
the
erection
of
a
monument
to
the
dead
commander
the
addresses
here
presented
are
placed
on
record
rather
for
their
biographical
interest
than
to
do
honor
to
the
dead
of
him
it
may
justly
be
said
that
he
needs
no
record
of
his
virtues
and
his
glory
his
illustrious
memory
is
fresh
and
will
be
fresh
throughout
all
coming
generations
in
every
heart
i
funeral
of
general
the
morning
of
the
obsequies
of
general
lee
broke
bright
and
cheerful
over
the
sorrowful
town
of
lexington
toward
noon
the
sun
poured
down
with
all
the
genial
warmth
of
indian
summer
and
after
it
was
hot
though
not
uncomfortably
so
the
same
solemnity
of
yesterday
reigned
supreme
with
the
difference
that
people
came
thronging
into
town
making
a
mournful
scene
of
bustle
the
gloomy
faces
the
comparative
silence
the
badges
and
emblems
of
mourning
that
everywhere
met
the
eye
and
the
noiseless
strict
decorum
which
was
observed
told
how
universal
and
deep
were
the
love
and
veneration
of
the
people
for
the
illustrious
dead
every
one
uniformly
and
religiously
wore
the
emblematic
crape
even
to
the
women
and
children
who
were
crowding
to
the
college
chapel
with
wreaths
of
flowers
fringed
with
mourning
all
sorrowfully
and
religiously
paid
their
last
tributes
of
respect
and
affection
to
the
great
dead
and
none
there
were
who
did
not
feel
a
just
pride
in
the
sad
offices
at
the
college
grounds
immediately
in
front
of
the
chapel
the
scene
was
peculiarly
sad
all
around
the
buildings
were
gloomily
draped
in
mourning
and
the
students
strolled
listlessly
over
the
grounds
awaiting
the
formation
of
the
funeral
procession
ladies
thronged
about
the
chapel
with
tearful
eyes
children
wept
outright
every
face
wore
a
saddened
expression
while
the
solemn
tolling
of
the
rendered
the
scene
still
more
one
of
grandeur
and
gloom
the
bells
of
the
churches
joined
in
the
mournful
requiem
the
funeral
procession
at
ten
precisely
in
accordance
with
the
programme
agreed
upon
the
students
numbering
four
hundred
formed
in
front
and
to
the
right
of
the
chapel
to
the
left
an
escort
of
honor
numbering
some
three
hundred
and
soldiers
was
formed
at
the
head
of
which
near
the
southwestern
entrance
to
the
grounds
was
the
institute
band
between
these
two
bodies
the
soldiers
and
students
stood
the
hearse
and
the
gray
of
the
dead
hero
both
draped
in
mourning
the
marshals
of
the
procession
in
number
wore
spotless
white
sashes
tied
at
the
waist
and
shoulders
with
crape
and
carrying
also
enveloped
in
the
same
emblematic
material
shortly
after
ten
at
a
signal
from
the

the
solemn

off
to
the
music
of

in
immediately
behind

and
solemnly
the

moved

down

thence
to

where
they
were
joined
by
a

dignitaries
of

state
and
the
citizens
generally
moving
still
onward
this
grand
funeral
pageant
which
had
now
assumed
gigantic
proportions
extending
nearly
a
mile
in
length
soon
reached
the
northeastern
extremity
of
the
town
when
it
took
the
road
to
the
virginia

at
the

here
the

was
highly
impressive
and
imposing

were
drawn
up

having
on
all
their
equipments
and
but
without
their
muskets
spectators
thronged
the
entire
line
of
the
procession
gazing
sadly
as
it
wended
its
way
and
the
sites
around
the
institute
were
crowded
as
the
entered
the
institute
grounds
a
salute
of
artillery
thundered
its
arrival
and
reverberated
it
far
across
the
distant
hills
and
valleys
of
virginia
awakening
echoes
which
have
been
hushed
since
lee
manfully
gave
up
the
struggle
of
the
lost
cause
at
appomattox
winding
along
the
indicated
route
toward
the
grounds
of
washington
college
the
procession
slowly
moved
past
the
institute
and
when
the
and
hearse
of
the
dead
chieftain
came
in
front
of
the
battalion
of
cadets
they
uncovered
their
heads
as
a
salute
of
reverence
and
respect
which
was
promptly
followed
by
the
spectators
when
this
was
concluded
the
visitors

of

joined
the

reëntered
the

was

then
followed
an
imposing
ceremony

towering
in

the

sleeping
in

the
vast

mute
and
sorrowful
the

and
silently
took
seats
in

the
rostrum
the
funeral
services
and
interment
then
followed
the
impressive
funeral
services
of
the
episcopal
church
for
the
dead
amid
a
silence
and
solemnity
that
were
imposing
and
sublimely
grand
there
was
no
funeral
oration
in
compliance
with
the
expressed
wish
of
the
distinguished
dead
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
services
in
the
chapel
the
vast
congregation
went
out
and
mingled
with
the
crowd
without
who
were
unable

then
carried
by

for

the

were
concluded
in

favorite
hymn
commencing
with
the
line
how
firm
a
foundation
ye
saint
of

lord
is
laid
for
your
faith
in
his
excellent
word
and
thus
closed
the
funeral
obsequies
of
robert
edward
lee
to
whom
may
be
fitly
applied
the
grand
poetic
epitaph
to
the
mansions
where
the
mighty
rest
since
their
foundations
came
a
nobler
guest
nor
was
to
the
bowers
of
bliss
conveyed
a
purer
saint
or
a
more
welcome
shade
ii
to
general
in
the
deep
emotion
with
which
the
death
of
general
lee
has
filled
all
classes
of
our
people
says
the
from
whose
pages
this
interesting
summary
is
taken
we
have
thought
that
a
selection
of
the
most
eloquent
or
otherwise
interesting
addresses
delivered
at
the
various
memorial
meetings
may
not
be
unacceptable
louisville
on
october
nearly
the
whole
city
was
draped
in
mourning
and
business
was
suspended
a
funeral
service
was
held
at
church
in
the
evening
an
immense
meeting
assembled
at
weissiger
hall
and
after
an
opening
address
by
mayor
baxter
the
following
resolutions
were
adopted
that
in
the
death
of
robert
lee
the
american
people
without
regard
to
states
or
sections
or
antecedents
or
opinions
lose
a
great
and
good
man
a
distinguished
and
useful
citizen
renowned
not
less
in
arms
than
in
the
arts
of
peace
and
that
the
cause
of
public
instruction
and
popular
culture
is
deprived
of
a
representative
whose
influence
and
example
will
be
felt
by
the
youth
of
our
country
for
long
ages
after
the
passions
in
the
midst
of
which
he
was
engaged
but
which
he
did
not
share
have
passed
into
history
and
the
peace
and
fraternity
of
the
american
republic
are
cemented
and
restored
by
the
broadest
and
purest
american
sentiment
that
a
copy
of
these
resolutions
be
forwarded
to
the
family
of
general
lee
to
the
trustees
of
washington
college
and
to
the
governor
and
general
assembly
of
virginia
address
of
general
breckinridge
president
ladies
and
in
the
humble
part
which
it
falls
to
me
to
take
in
these
interesting
ceremonies
if
for
any
cause
it
has
been
supposed
that
i
am
to
deliver
a
lengthy
address
i
am
not
responsible
for
the
origination
of
that
supposition
i
came
here
simply
to
mingle
my
grief
with
yours
at
the
loss
of
one
of
our
most
distinguished
citizens
and
indeed
i
feel
more
like
silence
than
like
words
i
am
in
the
presence
of
this
vast
assemblage
and
my
mind
goes
back
to
the
past
it
is
preoccupied
by
memories
coming
in
prominent
review
of
the
frequent
and
vicissitudes
which
have
characterized
the
last
ten
years
i
find
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
vast
assemblage
of
the
people
of
this
great
and
growing
city
who
meet
together
without
distinction
of
party
and
presided
over
by
your
chief
officer
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
respect
to
the
memory
of
the
man
who
was
the
leader
of
the
confederate
armies
in
the
late
war
between
the
states
it
is
in
itself
the
omen
of
reunion
i
am
not
surprised
at
the
spectacle
presented
here
throughout
the
entire
south
one
universal
cry
of
grief
has
broken
forth
at
the
death
of
general
lee
and
in
a
very
large
portion
of
the
north
manly
and
noble
tributes
have
been
paid
to
his
memory
my
words
shall
be
brief
but
plain
why
is
it
that
at
the
south
we
see
this
universal
spontaneous
demonstration
first
because
most
of
the
people
mourn
the
loss
of
a
leader
and
a
friend
but
beyond
that
i
must
say
they
seem
to
enter
an
unconscious
protest
against
the
ascription
either
to
him
or
them
of
treason
or
personal
dishonor
it
may
be
an
unconscious
protest
against
the
employment
by
a
portion
of
the
public
press
of
those
epithets
which
have
ceased
to
be
used
in
social
intercourse
it
is
an
invitation
on
their
part
to
the
people
of
the
north
and
south
east
and
west
if
there
be
any
remaining
rancor
in
their
bosoms
to
bury
it
in
the
grave
forever
i
will
not
recall
the
past
i
will
not
enter
upon
any
considerations
of
the
cause
of
that
great
struggle
this
demonstration
we
see
around
us
gives
the
plainest
evidence
that
there
is
no
disposition
to
indulge
in
useless
repinings
at
the
results
of
that
great
struggle
it
is
for
the
pen
of
the
historian
to
declare
the
cause
progress
and
probable
consequences
of
it
in
regard
to
those
who
followed
general
lee
who
gloried
in
his
successes
and
shared
his
misfortunes
i
have
but
this
to
say
the
world
watched
the
contest
in
which
they
were
engaged
and
yet
gives
testimony
to
their
gallantry
the
magnanimity
with
which
they
accepted
the
results
of
their
defeat
the
obedience
they
have
yielded
to
the
laws
of
the
federal
government
give
an
exhibition
so
rare
that
they
are
ennobled
by
their
calm
yet
noble
submission
for
the
rest
their
escutcheon
is
unstained
the
conquerors
themselves
for
their
own
glory
must
confess
that
they
were
brave
neither
my
friends
do
i
come
here
to
speak
of
the
military
career
of
general
lee
i
need
not
speak
of
it
this
evening
i
believe
that
this
is
universally
recognized
not
only
in
the
united
states
but
in
europe
it
has
made
the
circuit
of
the
world
i
come
but
to
utter
my
tribute
to
him
as
a
man
and
as
a
citizen
as
a
man
he
will
be
remembered
in
history
as
a
man
of
the
epoch
how
little
need
i
to
speak
of
his
character
after
listening
to
the
thrilling
delineation
of
it
which
we
had
this
morning
we
all
know
that
he
was
great
noble
and
he
was
just
and
moderate
but
was
perhaps
misunderstood
by
those
who
were
not
personally
acquainted
with
him
he
was
supposed
to
be
just
but
cold
far
from
it
he
had
a
warm
affectionate
heart
during
the
last
year
of
that
unfortunate
struggle
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
with
him
i
was
almost
constantly
by
his
side
and
it
was
during
the
two
months
immediately
preceding
the
fall
of
richmond
that
i
came
to
know
and
fully
understand
the
true
nobility
of
his
character
in
all
those
long
vigils
he
was
considerate
and
kind
gentle
firm
and
i
can
give
no
better
idea
of
the
impression
it
made
upon
me
than
to
say
it
inspired
me
with
an
ardent
love
of
the
man
and
a
profound
veneration
of
his
character
it
was
so
massive
and
noble
so
grand
in
its
proportions
that
all
men
must
admire
its
heroism
and
gallantry
yet
so
gentle
and
tender
that
a
woman
might
adopt
and
claim
it
as
her
own
if
the
spirit
which
animates
the
assembly
before
me
shall
become
general
and
permeate
the
whole
country
then
may
we
say
the
wounds
of
the
late
war
are
truly
healed
we
ask
for
him
only
what
we
give
to
others
among
the
more
eminent
of
the
departed
federal
generals
who
were
distinguished
for
their
gallantry
their
nobility
of
character
and
their
patriotism
may
be
mentioned
thomas
and
mcpherson
what
confederate
is
there
who
would
refuse
to
raise
his
cap
as
their
went
by
or
hesitate
to
drop
a
flower
upon
their
graves
why
because
they
were
men
of
courage
honor
and
nobility
because
they
were
true
to
their
convictions
of
right
and
soldiers
whose
hands
were
unstained
by
cruelty
or
pillage
those
of
us
who
were
so
fortunate
as
to
know
him
and
who
have
appeared
before
this
assemblage
composed
of
all
shades
of
opinion
claim
for
him
your
veneration
because
he
was
pure
and
noble
and
it
is
because
of
this
that
we
see
the
cities
and
towns
of
the
south
in
mourning
this
has
been
the
expression
throughout
the
whole
south
without
distinction
of
party
and
also
of
a
large
portion
of
the
north
is
not
this
why
these
tributes
have
been
paid
to
his
memory
is
it
not
because
his
piety
was
humble
and
sincere
because
he
accorded
in
victory
because
he
filled
his
position
with
admirable
dignity
because
he
taught
his
prostrate
comrades
how
to
suffer
and
be
strong
in
a
word
because
he
was
one
of
the
noblest
products
of
this
hemisphere
a
fit
object
to
sit
in
the
niche
which
he
created
in
the
temple
of
fame
but
he
failed
the
result
is
in
the
future
it
may
be
for
better
or
for
worse
we
hope
for
the
better
but
this
is
not
the
test
for
his
greatness
and
goodness
success
often
gilds
the
shallow
man
but
it
is
disaster
alone
that
reveals
the
qualities
of
true
greatness
was
his
life
a
failure
is
only
that
man
successful
who
erects
a
material
monument
of
greatness
by
the
enforcement
of
his
ideas
is
not
that
man
successful
also
who
by
his
valor
moderation
and
courage
with
all
their
associate
virtues
presents
to
the
world
such
a
specimen
of
true
manhood
as
his
children
and
children
children
will
be
proud
to
imitate
in
this
sense
he
was
not
a
failure
pardon
me
for
having
detained
you
so
long
i
know
there
are
here
and
there
those
who
will
reach
out
and
attempt
to
pluck
from
his
name
the
glory
which
surrounds
it
and
strike
with
malignant
fury
at
the
honors
awarded
to
him
yet
history
will
declare
that
the
remains
which
repose
in
the
vault
beneath
the
little
chapel
in
the
lovely
virginia
valley
are
not
only
those
of
a
valorous
soldier
but
those
of
a
great
and
good
american
general
john
finnell
next
addressed
the
audience
briefly
and
was
followed
by
general
william
preston
chairman
ladies
and
i
feel
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
me
to
add
any
eulogy
to
those
which
are
contained
in
the
resolutions
of
the
committee
or
a
more
merited
tribute
of
praise
than
those
which
have
already
fallen
from
the
lips
of
the
gentlemen
who
have
preceded
me
yet
on
an
occasion
like
this
i
am
willing
to
come
forward
and
add
a
word
to
testify
my
appreciation
of
the
great
virtues
and
admirable
character
of
one
that
commands
not
only
our
admiration
but
that
of
the
entire
country
not
alone
of
the
entire
country
but
his
character
has
excited
more
admiration
in
europe
than
among
ourselves
in
coming
ages
his
name
will
be
marked
with
lustre
and
will
be
one
of
the
richest
treasures
of
the
future
i
speak
of
one
just
gone
down
to
death
ripe
in
all
the
noble
attributes
of
manhood
and
illustrious
by
deeds
the
most
remarkable
in
character
that
have
occurred
in
the
history
of
america
since
its
discovery
it
is
now
some
years
since
i
first
made
the
acquaintance
of
general
lee
he
was
then
in
the
prime
of
manhood
in
mexico
and
i
first
saw
him
as
the
of
general
scott
in
the
valley
of
mexico
i
see
around
me
two
old
comrades
who
then
saw
general
lee
he
was
a
man
of
remarkable
personal
beauty
and
great
grace
of
body
he
had
a
finished
form
delicate
hands
graceful
in
person
while
here
and
there
a
gray
hair
streaked
with
silver
the
dark
locks
with
which
nature
had
clothed
his
noble
brow
there
were
discerning
minds
that
appreciated
his
genius
and
saw
in
him
the
coming
captain
of
america
his
commander
and
his
comrades
appreciated
his
ability
to
a
club
which
was
then
organized
he
belonged
together
with
general
mcclellan
general
albert
sydney
johnston
general
beauregard
and
a
host
of
others
they
recognized
in
lee
a
he
was
never
violent
he
never
wrangled
he
was
averse
to
quarrelling
and
not
a
single
difficulty
marked
his
career
but
all
acknowledged
his
justness
and
wonderful
evenness
of
mind
rare
intelligence
combined
with
these
qualities
served
to
make
him
a
fit
representative
of
his
great
prototype
general
washington
he
had
been
accomplished
by
every
finish
that
a
military
education
could
bestow
i
remember
when
general
lee
was
appointed
at
the
same
time
that
sydney
johnston
was
appointed
colonel
and
general
scott
thought
that
lee
should
have
been
colonel
i
was
talking
with
general
scott
on
the
subject
long
before
the
late
struggle
between
the
north
and
south
took
place
and
he
then
said
that
lee
was
the
greatest
living
soldier
in
america
he
did
not
object
to
the
other
commission
but
he
thought
lee
should
have
been
first
promoted
finally
he
said
to
me
with
emphasis
which
you
will
pardon
me
for
relating
tell
you
that
if
i
were
on
my
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
should
tell
me
that
a
great
battle
was
to
be
fought
for
the
liberty
or
slavery
of
the
country
and
asked
my
judgment
as
to
the
ability
of
a
commander
i
would
say
with
my
dying
breath
let
it
be
robert
e
lee
ah
great
soldier
that
he
was
princely
general
that
he
was
he
has
fulfilled
his
mission
and
borne
it
so
that
no
invidious
tongue
can
level
the
shafts
of
calumny
at
the
great
character
which
he
has
left
behind
him
but
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
was
not
in
this
that
the
matchless
attributes
of
his
character
were
found
you
have
assembled
here
not
so
much
to
do
honor
to
general
lee
but
to
testify
your
appreciation
of
the
worth
of
the
principles
governing
his
character
and
if
the
minds
of
this
assemblage
were
explored
you
would
find
there
was
a
gentleness
and
a
grace
in
his
character
which
had
won
your
love
and
brought
forth
testimonials
of
universal
admiration
take
but
a
single
instance
at
the
battle
of
gettysburg
after
the
attack
on
the
cemetery
when
his
troops
were
repulsed
and
beaten
the
men
threw
up
their
muskets
and
said
we
have
failed
and
it
is
our
fault
my
men
said
he
knowing
the
style
of
fighting
of
general
stonewall
jackson
have
done
well
is
my
fault
i
am
to
blame
and
no
one
but
me
what
man
is
there
that
would
not
have
gone
to
renewed
death
for
such
a
leader
so
when
we
examine
his
whole
character
it
is
in
his
private
life
that
you
find
his
true
greatness
the
christian
simplicity
of
his
character
and
his
great
veneration
for
truth
and
nobility
the
grand
elements
of
his
greatness
what
man
could
have
laid
down
his
sword
at
the
feet
of
a
victorious
general
with
greater
dignity
than
did
he
at
appomattox
he
laid
down
his
sword
with
grace
and
dignity
and
secured
for
his
soldiers
the
best
terms
that
fortune
would
permit
in
that
he
shows
marked
greatness
seldom
shown
by
great
captains
after
the
battle
of
sedan
the
wild
cries
of
the
citizens
of
paris
went
out
for
the
blood
of
the
emperor
but
at
appomattox
veneration
and
love
only
met
the
eyes
of
the
troops
who
looked
upon
their
commander
i
will
not
trespass
upon
your
time
much
farther
when
i
last
saw
him
the
raven
hair
had
turned
white
in
a
small
village
church
his
reverent
head
was
bowed
in
prayer
the
humblest
step
was
that
of
robert
lee
as
he
entered
the
portals
of
the
temple
erected
to
god
in
broken
responses
he
answered
to
the
services
of
the
church
noble
sincere
and
humble
in
his
religion
he
showed
forth
his
true
character
in
laying
aside
his
sword
to
educate
the
youth
of
his
country
never
did
he
appear
more
noble
than
at
that
time
he
is
now
gone
and
rests
in
peace
and
has
crossed
that
mysterious
stream
that
stonewall
jackson
saw
with
inspired
eyes
when
he
asked
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
take
his
troops
across
the
river
and
forever
rest
beneath
the
shadows
of
the
trees
after
a
few
remarks
from
hon
lyttle
the
meeting
adjourned
augusta
a
meeting
was
held
at
augusta
on
october
at
the
city
hall
the
preamble
and
resolutions
adopted
were
as
follows
this
day
throughout
all
this
southern
land
sorrow
is
ascending
to
heaven
for
the
death
of
robert
lee
and
communities
everywhere
are
honoring
themselves
in
striving
to
do
honor
to
that
great
name
and
we
the
people
of
augusta
who
were
not
laggards
in
upholding
his
glorious
banner
while
it
floated
to
the
breeze
would
swell
the
general
lamentation
of
his
departure
therefore
be
it
that
no
people
in
the
tide
of
time
has
been
bereaved
as
we
are
bereaved
for
no
other
people
has
had
such
a
man
to
lose
greece
rich
in
heroes
rome
prolific
mother
of
great
citizens
so
that
the
name
of
roman
is
the
synonyme
of
all
that
is
noblest
in
citizenship
had
no
man
coming
up
to
the
full
measure
of
this
great
departed
on
scores
of
consummate
commander
everywhere
bravest
soldier
in
failure
sublimest
hero
in
disbanding
his
army
most
pathetic
of
writers
in
persecution
most
patient
of
power
victims
in
private
life
purest
of
men
he
was
such
that
all
christendom
with
one
consent
named
him
great
we
recalling
that
so
also
mankind
have
styled
alexander
caesar
frederick
and
napoleon
and
beholding
in
the
confederate
leader
qualities
higher
and
better
than
theirs
find
that
language
poor
indeed
which
only
enables
us
to
call
him
him
standing
among
the
great
of
all
ages
preëminent
that
our
admiration
of
the
man
is
not
the
partial
judgment
of
his
adherents
only
but
so
clear
stand
his
greatness
and
his
goodness
that
even
the
bitterest
of
foes
has
not
ventured
to
asperse
him
while
the
air
has
been
filled
with
calumnies
and
revilings
of
his
cause
none
have
been
aimed
at
him
if
there
are
spirits
so
base
that
they
can
not
discover
and
reverence
his
greatness
and
his
goodness
they
have
at
least
shrunk
from
encountering
the
certain
indignation
of
mankind
this
day
disfranchised
by
stupid
power
as
he
was
branded
as
he
was
in
the
perverted
vocabulary
of
usurpers
as
rebel
and
traitor
his
death
has
even
in
distant
lands
moved
more
tongues
and
stirred
more
hearts
than
the
siege
of
a
mighty
city
and
the
triumphs
of
a
great
king
that
while
he
died
far
too
soon
for
his
country
he
had
lived
long
enough
for
his
fame
this
was
complete
and
the
future
could
unfold
nothing
to
add
to
it
in
this
age
of
startling
changes
imagination
might
have
pictured
him
even
in
the
years
which
he
yet
lacked
of
the
allotted
period
of
human
life
once
more
at
the
head
of
devoted
armies
and
the
conqueror
of
glorious
fields
but
none
could
have
been
more
glorious
than
those
he
had
already
won
wrong
too
might
again
have
triumphed
over
right
and
he
have
borne
defeat
with
sublimest
resignation
but
this
he
had
already
done
at
appomattox
unrelenting
hate
to
his
lost
cause
might
have
again
consigned
him
to
the
walks
of
private
life
and
he
have
become
an
exemplar
of
all
the
virtues
of
a
private
station
but
this
he
had
already
been
in
the
shades
of
lexington
the
contingencies
of
the
future
could
only
have
revealed
him
greatest
soldier
sublimest
hero
best
of
men
and
he
was
already
all
of
these
the
years
to
come
were
barren
of
any
thing
which
could
add
to
his
perfect
name
and
fame
he
had
nothing
to
lose
but
alas
we
his
people
every
thing
by
his
departure
from
this
world
which
was
unworthy
of
him
to
that
other
where
the
good
and
the
pure
of
all
ages
will
welcome
him
thither
follow
him
the
undying
love
of
every
true
southern
man
and
woman
and
the
admiration
of
all
the
world
address
of
general
wright
i
rise
simply
to
move
the
adoption
of
the
resolutions
which
have
just
been
read
to
the
meeting
by
major
cumming
you
have
heard
and
the
people
here
assembled
have
heard
these
resolutions
they
are
truthful
eloquent
and
expressive
although
announced
as
a
speaker
on
this
sad
occasion
i
had
determined
to
forego
any
such
attempt
but
an
allusion
a
passing
reference
to
one
of
the
sublime
virtues
of
the
illustrious
dead
made
in
the
resolutions
which
have
just
been
read
in
your
hearing
has
induced
me
to
add
a
word
or
two
your
resolutions
speak
of
general
lee
patience
under
the
persecutions
of
power
it
was
this
virtue
which
ennobled
the
character
as
it
was
one
of
the
most
prominent
traits
in
the
life
of
him
for
whose
death
a
whole
nation
mourns
and
to
pay
a
tribute
to
the
memory
of
whom
this
multitude
has
assembled
here
this
morning
while
general
lee
was
all
and
more
than
has
been
said
of
him
the
great
general
the
true
christian
and
the
valiant
soldier
there
was
another
character
in
which
he
appeared
more
conspicuously
than
in
any
of
the
rest
the
quiet
dignity
with
which
he
encountered
defeat
and
the
patience
with
which
he
met
the
persecution
of
malignant
power
we
may
search
the
pages
of
all
history
both
sacred
and
profane
and
there
seems
to
be
but
one
character
who
possessed
in
so
large
a
degree
this
remarkable
trait
take
general
lee
whole
life
and
examine
it
observe
his
skill
and
courage
as
a
soldier
his
patriotism
and
his
fidelity
to
principle
the
purity
of
his
private
life
and
then
remember
the
disasters
which
he
faced
and
the
persecutions
to
which
he
was
subjected
and
it
would
seem
that
ever
endured
so
much
not
even
david
the
sweet
singer
of
israel
job
has
been
handed
down
to
posterity
by
the
pages
of
sacred
history
as
the
embodiment
of
patience
as
the
man
who
overwhelmed
with
the
most
numerous
and
bitter
afflictions
never
lost
his
fortitude
and
who
endured
every
fresh
trial
with
uncomplaining
resignation
but
it
seems
to
me
that
even
job
displayed
not
the
patience
of
our
own
loved
hero
for
while
job
suffered
much
he
endured
less
than
general
lee
job
was
compelled
to
lose
his
children
his
friends
and
his
property
but
he
was
never
required
to
give
up
country
general
lee
was
and
with
more
than
the
persecutions
of
job
he
stands
revealed
to
the
world
the
truest
and
the
most
sublime
hero
whom
the
ages
have
produced
to
a
patriot
like
lee
the
loss
of
country
was
the
greatest
evil
which
could
be
experienced
and
it
was
this
last
blow
which
has
caused
us
to
assemble
here
to
mourn
his
departure
he
lost
friends
and
kindred
and
property
in
the
struggle
and
yet
according
to
the
news
which
the
telegraph
brought
us
this
morning
it
was
the
loss
of
his
cause
which
finally
sundered
the
of
the
hero
and
drew
him
from
earth
to
heaven
yes
the
weight
of
this
great
sorrow
which
first
fell
upon
him
under
the
fatal
at
appomattox
has
dwelt
with
him
growing
heavier
and
more
unendurable
with
each
succeeding
year
from
that
time
until
last
wednesday
morn
when
the
soul
of
lee
passed
away
as
i
said
before
chairman
i
only
rose
to
move
the
adoption
of
the
resolutions
and
if
i
have
said
more
than
i
ought
to
have
said
it
is
because
i
knew
the
illustrious
dead
because
i
loved
him
and
because
i
mourn
his
loss
address
of
judge
hilliard
it
is
proper
that
the
people
should
pay
a
public
tribute
to
the
memory
of
a
great
man
when
he
dies
not
a
ruler
not
one
who
merely
holds
a
great
public
position
but
a
great
man
one
who
has
served
his
day
and
generation
it
can
not
benefit
the
dead
but
it
is
eminently
profitable
to
the
living
the
consciousness
than
when
we
cease
to
live
our
memory
will
be
cherished
is
a
noble
incentive
to
live
well
this
great
popular
demonstration
is
due
to
general
lee
life
and
character
it
is
not
ordered
by
the
government
the
government
ignored
him
but
is
rendered
as
a
spontaneous
tribute
to
the
memory
of
an
illustrious
man
good
true
and
great
he
held
no
place
in
the
government
and
since
the
war
has
had
no
military
rank
but
he
was
a
true
man
after
all
that
is
the
noblest
tribute
you
can
pay
to
any
man
to
say
of
him
he
was
a
true
man
general
lee
character
was
eminently
american
in
europe
they
have
their
ideas
their
standards
of
merit
their
rewards
for
great
exploits
they
cover
one
with
decorations
they
give
him
a
great
place
in
the
government
they
make
him
a
marshal
wellington
began
his
career
with
humble
rank
he
was
young
wellesley
he
rose
to
be
the
duke
of
wellington
in
our
country
we
have
no
such
rewards
for
great
deeds
one
must
enjoy
the
patronage
of
the
government
or
he
must
take
the
fortunes
of
private
life
general
lee
was
educated
at
the
great
military
academy
west
point
he
entered
the
army
was
promoted
from
time
to
time
for
brilliant
services
in
mexico
fought
gallantly
under
the
flag
of
the
united
states
and
was
still
advancing
in
his
military
career
in
when
virginia
became
involved
in
the
great
contest
that
then
grew
up
between
the
states
virginia
was
his
mother
she
called
him
to
her
side
to
defend
her
and
resigning
his
commission
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
not
for
a
moment
looking
for
advancement
there
not
counting
the
cost
not
offering
his
sword
to
the
service
of
power
nor
yet
laying
it
down
at
the
feet
of
the
government
he
unsheathed
it
and
took
his
stand
in
defence
of
the
great
principles
asserted
by
virginia
in
the
revolution
when
she
contended
with
great
britain
the
right
of
every
people
to

the
cause
was

it
was
the

constitutional

he
stood
by
it
to
the
last
what
must
have
been
the
convictions
of
a
man
like
general
lee
when
mounted
on
the
same
horse
that
had
borne
him
in
battle
upon
which
he
was
seated
when
the
lines
of
battle
formed
by
his
own
heroic
men
wavered
and
he
seized
the
standard
to
lead
the
charge
but
his
soldiers
rushed
to
him
and
laying
their
hands
on
his
bridle
said
we
can
not
fire
a
gun
unless
you
retire
what
must
have
been
his
emotions
as
he
rode
through
his
own
lines
at
appomattox
to
the
commander
of
the
opposing
army

tendered
his
sword

to
you
that
i
do
not

anywhere
a
sublimer
sentiment
than
general
lee
uttered
when
he
said
virtue
ought
to
be
equal
to
human
calamity
it
will
live
forever
general
lee
died
at
the
right
time
his
sun
did
not
go
down
in
the
strife
of
battle
in
the
midst
of
the
thunder
of
cannon
dimmed
by
the
lurid
smoke
of

he
survived
all
this
lived
with
so
much
dignity
silent
yet
thoughtful
unseduced
by
the
offers
of

or
of
advancement

disk
went
down
behind
the
virginia
hills
shedding
its
departing
lustre
not
only
upon
this
country
but
upon
the
whole
world
his
memory
is
as
much
respected
in
england
as
it
is
here
and
at
the
north
as
well
as
at
the
south
true
hearts
honor
it
there
is
one
thing
i
wish
to
say
before
i
take
my
seat
general
fame
ought
to
rest
on
the
true
base
he
did
not
draw
his
sword
to
perpetuate
human
slavery
whatever
may
have
been
his
opinions
in
regard
to
it
he
did
not
seek
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
he
drew
it
in
defence
of
constitutional
liberty
that
cause
is
not
dead
but
will
live
forever
the
result
of
the
war
established
the
authority
of
the
united
states
the
union
will
stand
let
it
stand
forever
the
flag
floats
over
the
whole
country
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
let
it
increase
in
lustre
and
let
the
power
of
the
government
grow
still
the
cause
for
which
general
lee
struck
is
not
a
lost
cause
it
is
conceded
that
these
states
must
continue
united
under
a
common
government
we
do
not
wish
to
sunder
it
nor
to
disturb
it
but
the
great
principle
that
underlies
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
principle
that
the
people
have
a
right
to
choose
their
own
form
of
government
and
to
have
their
liberties
protected
by
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
is
an
indestructible
principle
you
can
not
destroy
it
like
milton
angels
it
is
immortal
you
may
wound
but
you
can
not
kill
it
it
is
like
the
volcanic
fires
that
flame
in
the
depths
of
the
earth
it
will
yet
upheave
the
ocean
and
the
land
and
flame
up
to
heaven

my
epitaph
until

is

place

but
you
may
write
general

epitaph
now
the
principle
for
which
he
fought
will
survive
him
his
evening
was
in
perfect
harmony
with
his
life
he
had
time
to
think
to
recall
the
past
to
prepare
for
the
future
an
offer
originating
in
georgia
and
i
believe
in
this
very
city
was
made
to
him
to
place
an
immense
sum
of
money
at
his
disposal
if
he
would
consent
to
reside
in
the
city
of
new

and
represent
southern

millions
would
have
flowed
to
him
but
he
declined
he
said
i
am
grateful
but
i
have
a
task
which
i
must
accomplish
i
have
led
the
young
men
of
the
south
in
battle
i
have
seen
many
of
them
fall
under
my
standard
i
shall
devote
my
life
now
to
training
young
men
to
do
their
duty
in
life
and
he
did
it
was
beautiful
to
see
him
in
that
glorious
valley

their
protecting
shadows

fame
is
not
bounded
by

nor
by

i
rejoice
that

gave
him
birth
i
rejoice
that
the

will
hold
his
ashes
but
his
fame
belongs
to
the
human
race
washington
too
was
born
in
the
south
and
sleeps
in
the
south
but
his
great
fame
is
not
to
be
appropriated
by
this
country
it
is
the
inheritance
of
mankind
we
place
the
name
of

by

to

have
been
transmitted
on

wings

will
with
pious
jealousy
envy
our
grief
because
robert
lee
was
an
american
seven
cities
claimed
the
honor
of
having
given
birth
to
the
great
pagan
poet
but
all
christian
nations
while
revering
america
as
the
mother
of
robert
lee
will
claim
for
the
nineteenth
century
the
honor
of
his
birth
there
was
but
one
lee
the
great
christian
captain
and
his
fame
justly
belongs
to
christendom
the
nineteenth
century
has
attacked
every
thing
it
has
attacked
god
the
soul
reason
morals
society
the
distinction
between
good
and
evil
christianity
is
vindicated
by
the
virtues
of
lee
he
is
the
most
brilliant
and
cogent
argument
in
favor
of
a
system
illustrated
by
such
a
man
he
is
the
type
of
the
reign
of
law
in
the
moral
order
that
reign
of
law
which
the
philosophic
duke
of
argyll
has
so
recently
and
so
ably
discussed
as
pervading
the
natural
as
well
as
the
supernatural
world
one
of
the
chief
characteristics
of
the
christian
is
duty
throughout
a
checkered
life
the
conscientious
performance
of
duty
seems
to
have
been
the
mainspring
of
the
actions
of
general
lee
in
his
relations
of
father
son
husband
soldier
citizen
duty
shines
conspicuous
in
all
his
acts
his
agency
as
he
advanced
to
more
elevated
stations
attracts
more
attention
and
surrounds
him
with
a
brighter
halo
of
glory
but
he
is
unchanged
from
first
to
last
it
is
robert
lee
the
most
momentous
act
of
his
life
was
the
selection
of
sides
at
the
commencement
of
the
political
troubles
which
immediately
preceded
the
recent
conflict
high
in
military
rank
caressed
by
general
scott
courted
by
those
possessed
of
influence
and
authority
no
politician
happy
in
his
domestic
relations
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
competent
fortune
consisting
in
the
main
of
property
situated
on
the
borders
of
virginia
nevertheless
impelled
by
a
sense
of
duty
as
he
himself
testified
before
a
congressional
committee
since
the
war
general
lee
determined
to
risk
all
and
unite
his
fortunes
with
those
of
his
native
state
whose
ordinances
as
one
of
her
citizens
he
considered
himself
bound
to
obey
having
joined
the
confederate
army
he
complained
not
that
he
was
assigned
to
the
obscure
duty
of
constructing
for
south
carolina
and
georgia
nor
that
he
was
subsequently
relegated
to
unambitious
commands
in
western
virginia
the
accidental
circumstance
that
general
joseph
johnston
was
wounded
at
the
battle
of
seven
pines
in
may
placed
lee
in
command
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
as
commander
of
that
army
he
achieved
reputation
without
giving
occasion
during
a
period
of
three
years
to
any
complaint
on
the
part
of
officers
men
or
citizens
or
enemies
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
any
act
illegal
oppressive
unjust
or
inhuman
in
its
character
this
is
the
highest
tribute
possible
to
the
wisdom
and
virtue
of
general
lee
for
as
a
general
rule
law
was
degraded
officers
whether
justly
or
unjustly
were
constantly
the
subject
of
complaint
and
discord
and
jealousy
prevailed
in
camp
and
in
the
there
was
a
fraction
of
our
people
represented
by
an
unavailing
minority
in
congress
who
either
felt
or
professed
to
feel
a
jealousy
whose
theory
was
just
but
whose
application
at
such
a
time
was
unsound
they
wished
to
give
as
little
power
as
possible
because
they
dreaded
a
military
despotism
and
thus
desired
to
send
our
armies
forth
with
half
a
shield
and
broken
swords
to
protect
the
government
from
its
enemies
lest
if
the
bucklers
were
entire
and
the
swords
perfect
they
might
be
tempted
in
the
heyday
of
victory
to
smite
their
employers
but
this
want
of
confidence
never
manifested
itself
toward
general
lee
whose
conduct
satisfied
the
most
suspicious
that
his
ambition
was
not
of
glory
but
of
the
performance
of
duty
the
army
always
felt
this
the
fact
that
he
sacrificed
no
masses
of
human
beings
in
desperate
charges
that
he
might
gather
laurels
from
the
spot
enriched
by
their
gore
a
year
or
more
before
he
was
appointed
of
all
the
confederate
forces
a
bill
passed
congress
creating
that
office
it
failed
to
become
a
law
the
president
having
withheld
his
approval
lee
made
no
complaints
his
friends
solicited
no
votes
to
counteract
the
veto
when
a
bill
for
the
same
purpose
was
passed
at
a
subsequent
period
it
was
whispered
about
that
he
could
not
accept
the
position
to
a
committee
of
virginians
who
had
called
on
him
to
ascertain
the
truth
his
reply
was
that
he
felt
bound
to
accept
any
post
the
duties
of
which
his
country
believed
him
competent
to
perform
after
the
battle
of
gettysburg
he
tendered
his
resignation
to
president
davis
because
he
was
apprehensive
his
failure
the
responsibility
for
which
he
did
not
pretend
to
throw
on
his
troops
or
officers
would
produce
distrust
of
his
abilities
and
destroy
his
usefulness
i
am
informed
the
president
in
a
beautiful
and
touching
letter
declined
to
listen
to
such
a
proposition
during
the
whole
period
of
the
war
he
steadily
declined
all
presents
and
when
on
one
occasion
a
gentleman
sent
him
several
dozen
of
wine
he
turned
it
over
to
the
hospitals
in
richmond
saying
the
wounded
and
sick
needed
it
more
than
he
he
was
extremely
simple
and
unostentatious
in
his
habits
and
shared
with
his
soldiers
their
privations
as
well
as
their
dangers
toward
the
close
of
the
war
meat
was
very
scarce
within
the
confederate
lines
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
contending
armies
an
aide
of
the
president
having
occasion
to
visit
general
lee
en
official
business
in
the
field
was
invited
to
dinner
the
meal
spread
on
the
table
consisted
of
and
a
small
piece
of
bacon
buried
in
a
large
dish
of
greens
the
aide
discovered
that
none
of
the
company
which
was
composed
of
the
general
personal
staff
partook
of
the
meat
though
requested
to
do
so
in
the
most
urbane
manner
by
the
general
who
presided
he
therefore
also
declined
and
noticed
that
the
meat
was
carried
off
untouched
after
the
meal
was
over
he
inquired
of
one
of
the
officers
present
what
was
the
reason
for
this
extraordinary
conduct
his
reply
was
had
borrowed
the
meat
for
the
occasion
and
promised
to
return
it
duty
alone
induced
this
great
soldier
to
submit
to
such
privation
for
the
slightest
intimation
given
to
friends
in
richmond
would
have
filled
his
tent
with
all
the
luxuries
that
and
speculators
had
introduced
for
the
favored
few
able
to
purchase
this
performance
of
duty
was
accompanied
by
no
harsh
manner
or
cynical
expressions
for
the
man
whose
soul
is
ennobled
by
true
heroism
possesses
a
heart
as
tender
as
it
is
firm
his
calmness
under
the
most
trying
circumstances
and
his
uniform
sweetness
of
manner
were
almost
poetical
they
manifested
most
sustained
tenderness
of
soul
that
ever
caressed
the
chords
of
a
lyre
in
council
he
was
temperate
and
patient
and
his
words
fell
softly
and
evenly
as
like
the
sentences
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
ulysses
on
the
termination
of
the
war
his
conduct
until
his
death
has
challenged
the
admiration
of
friends
and
foes
he
honestly
acquiesced
in
the
inevitable
result
of
the
struggle
no
discontent
sourness
or
complaint
has
marred
his
tranquil
life
at
washington
college
where
death
found
him
at
his
post
of
duty
engaged
in
fitting
the
young
men
of
his
country
by
proper
discipline
and
education
for
the
performance
of
the
varied
duties
of
life
it
is
somewhat
singular
that
both
lee
and
his
great
lieutenant
jackson
should
in
their
last
moments
have
referred
to
hill
it
is
reported
that
general
lee
said
my
tent
be
struck
send
for
hill
while
the
lamented
jackson
in
his
delirium
cried
out
hill
prepare
for
action
march
the
infantry
rapidly
to
the
front
let
us
cross
over
the
river
and
rest
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
both
heroes
died
with
commands
for
military
movements
on
their
lips
both
the
noblest
specimens
of
the
christian
soldier
produced
by
any
country
or
any
age
both
now
rest
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
of
heaven
rev
palmer
then
spoke
as
follows
and
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
had
i
been
permitted
to
sit
a
simple
listener
to
the
eloquent
tribute
paid
to
the
immortal
chieftain
who
now
reposes
in
death
by
the
speaker
who
has
just
taken
his
seat
the
nature
of
my
calling
so
far
separates
me
from
public
life
that
i
am
scarcely
competent
for
the
office
of
alluding
to
the
elements
which
naturally
gather
around
his
career
when
informed
that
other
artists
would
draw
the
picture
of
the
warrior
and
the
hero
i
yielded
a
cheerful
compliance
in
the
belief
that
nothing
was
left
but
to
describe
the
christian
and
the
man
you
are
entirely
familiar
with
the
early
life
of
him
over
whose
grave
you
this
night
shed
tears
with
his
grave
and
sedate
boyhood
giving
promise
of
the
reserved
force
of
mature
manhood
with
his
academic
career
at
west
point
where
he
received
the
highest
honors
of
a
class
brilliant
with
such
names
as
general
joseph
johnston
his
seizure
of
the
highest
honors
of
a
long
apprenticeship
in
that
institution
and
his
abrupt
ascension
in
the
mexican
war
from
obscurity
to
fame
all
are
too
firmly
stamped
in
the
minds
of
his
admirers
to
require
even
an
allusion
you
are
too
familiar
to
need
a
repetition
from
my
lips
of
that
great
mental
and
spiritual
struggle
passed
not
one
night
but
many
when
abandoning
the
service
in
which
he
had
gathered
so
much
of
honor
and
reputation
he
determined
to
lay
his
heart
upon
the
altar
of
his
native
state
and
swear
to
live
or
die
in
her
defence
it
would
be
a
somewhat
singular
subject
of
speculation
to
discover
how
it
is
that
national
character
so
often
remarkably
expresses
itself
in
single
individuals
who
are
born
as
representatives
of
a
class
it
is
wonderful
for
it
has
been
the
remark
of
ages
how
the
great
are
born
in
clusters
sometimes
indeed
one
star
shining
with
solitary
splendor
in
the
firmament
above
but
generally
gathered
in
grand
constellations
filling
the
sky
with
glory
what
is
that
combination
of
influences
partly
physical
partly
intellectual
but
somewhat
more
moral
which
should
make
a
particular
country
productive
of
men
great
over
all
others
on
earth
and
to
all
ages
of
time
ancient
greece
with
her
indented
coast
inviting
to
maritime
adventures
from
her
earliest
period
was
the
mother
of
heroes
in
war
of
poets
in
song
of
sculptors
and
artists
and
stands
up
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
the
educator
of
mankind
living
in
the
grandeur
of
her
works
and
in
the
immortal
productions
of
minds
which
modern
civilization
with
all
its
cultivation
and
refinement
and
science
never
surpassed
and
scarcely
equalled
and
why
in
the
three
hundred
years
of
american
history
it
should
be
given
to
the
old
dominion
to
be
the
grand
mother
not
only
of
states
but
of
the
men
by
whom
states
and
empires
are
formed
it
might
be
curious
were
it
possible
for
us
to
inquire
unquestionably
president
there
is
in
this
problem
the
element
of
race
for
he
is
blind
to
all
the
truths
of
history
to
all
the
revelations
of
the
past
who
does
not
recognize
a
select
race
as
we
recognize
a
select
individual
of
a
race
to
make
all
history
but
pretermitting
all
speculation
of
that
sort
when
virginia
unfolds
the
scroll
of
her
immortal
sons
not
because
illustrious
men
did
not
precede
him
gathering
in
constellations
and
clusters
but
because
the
name
shines
out
through
those
constellations
and
clusters
in
all
its
peerless
grandeur
we
read
the
name
of
george
washington
and
then
president
after
the
interval
of
of
a
century
when
your
jealous
eye
has
ranged
down
the
record
and
traced
the
names
that
history
will
never
let
die
you
come
to
the
name
the
only
name
in
all
the
annals
of
history
that
can
be
named
in
the
perilous
connection
of
robert
lee
the
second
washington
well
may
old
virginia
be
proud
of
her
twin
sons
born
almost
a
century
apart
but
shining
like
those
binary
stars
which
open
their
glory
and
shed
their
splendor
on
the
darkness
of
the
world
sir
it
is
not
an
artifice
of
rhetoric
which
suggests
this
parallel
between
two
great
names
in
american
history
for
the
suggestion
springs
spontaneously
to
every
mind
and
men
scarcely
speak
of
lee
without
thinking
of
a
mysterious
connection
that
binds
the
two
together
they
were
alike
in
the
presage
of
their
early
history
the
history
of
their
boyhood
both
earnest
grave
studious
both
alike
in
that
peculiar
purity
which
belongs
only
to
a
noble
boy
and
which
makes
him
a
brave
and
noble
man
filling
the
page
of
a
history
spotless
until
closed
in
death
alike
in
that
commanding
presence
which
seems
to
be
the
signature
of
heaven
sometimes
placed
on
a
great
soul
when
to
that
soul
is
given
a
fit
alike
in
that
noble
carriage
and
commanding
dignity
exercising
a
mesmeric
influence
and
a
hidden
power
which
could
not
be
repressed
upon
all
who
came
within
its
charm
alike
in
the
remarkable
combination
and
symmetry
of
their
intellectual
attributes
all
brought
up
to
the
same
equal
level
no
faculty
of
the
mind
overlapping
any
other
all
so
equal
so
well
developed
the
judgment
the
reason
the
memory
the
fancy
that
you
are
almost
disposed
to
deny
them
greatness
because
no
single
attribute
of
the
mind
was
projected
upon
itself
just
as
objects
appear
sometimes
smaller
to
the
eye
from
the
exact
symmetry
and
beauty
of
their
proportions
alike
above
all
in
that
that
christian
virtue
to
which
so
beautiful
a
tribute
has
been
rendered
by
my
friend
whose
high
privilege
it
was
to
be
a
compeer
and
comrade
with
the
immortal
dead
although
in
another
department
and
sphere
and
yet
alike
president
in
their
external
fortune
so
strangely
dissimilar
the
one
the
representative
and
the
agent
of
a
stupendous
revolution
which
it
pleased
heaven
to
bless
and
give
birth
to
one
of
the
mightiest
nations
on
the
globe
the
other
the
representative
and
agent
of
a
similar
revolution
upon
which
it
pleased
high
heaven
to
throw
the
darkness
of
its
frown
so
that
bearing
upon
his
generous
heart
the
weight
of
this
crushed
cause
he
was
at
length
overwhelmed
and
the
nation
whom
he
led
in
battle
gathers
with
spontaneity
of
grief
over
all
this
land
which
is
ploughed
with
graves
and
reddened
with
blood
and
the
tears
of
a
widowed
nation
in
her
bereavement
are
shed
over
his
honored
grave
but
these
crude
suggestions
which
fall
almost
impromptu
from
my
lips
suggest
that
which
i
desire
to
offer
before
this
audience
i
accept
robert
lee
as
the
true
type
of
the
american
man
and
the
southern
gentleman
a
brilliant
english
writer
has
well
remarked
with
a
touch
of
sound
philosophy
that
when
a
nation
has
rushed
upon
its
fate
the
whole
force
of
the
national
life
will
sometimes
shoot
up
in
one
grand
character
like
the
aloe
which
blooms
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
years
shooting
up
in
one
single
spike
of
glory
and
then
expires
and
wherever
philosophy
refinement
and
culture
have
gone
upon
the
globe
it
is
possible
to
place
the
finger
upon
individual
men
who
are
the
exemplars
of
a
nation
character
those
typical
forms
under
which
others
less
noble
less
expanded
have
manifested
themselves
that
gentle
that
perfect
moderation
that
which
enabled
him
to
be
so
amid
the
most
trying
difficulties
of
his
public
career
a
refinement
almost
such
as
that
which
marks
the
character
of
the
purest
woman
were
blended
in
him
with
that
massive
strength
that
mighty
endurance
that
consistency
and
power
which
gave
him
and
the
people
whom
he
led
such
momentum
under
the
disadvantages
of
the
struggle
through
which
he
passed
born
from
the
general
level
of
american
society
blood
of
a
noble
ancestry
flowed
in
his
veins
and
he
was
a
type
of
the
race
from
which
he
sprang
such
was
the
grandeur
and
urbaneness
of
his
manner
the
dignity
and
majesty
of
his
carriage
that
his
only
peer
in
social
life
could
be
found
in
courts
and
among
those
educated
amid
the
refinements
of
courts
and
thrones
in
that
regard
there
was
something
beautiful
and
appropriate
that
he
should
become
in
the
later
years
of
his
life
the
educator
of
the
young
sir
it
is
a
cause
for
mourning
before
high
heaven
that
he
was
not
spared
thirty
years
to
educate
a
generation
for
the
time
that
is
to
come
for
as
in
the
days
when
the
red
banner
streamed
over
the
land
the
south
sent
her
sons
to
fight
under
his
flag
and
beneath
the
wave
of
his
sword
these
sons
have
been
sent
again
to
sit
at
his
feet
when
he
was
the
disciple
of
the
muses
and
the
teacher
of
philosophy
oh
that
he
might
have
brought
his
more
than
regal
character
his
majestic
fame
all
his
intellectual
and
moral
endowments
to
the
task
of
fitting
those
that
should
come
in
the
crisis
of
the
future
to
take
the
mantle
that
had
fallen
from
his
shoulders
and
bear
it
to
the
generations
that
are
unborn
general
lee
i
accept
as
the
representative
of
his
people
and
of
the
temper
with
which
this
whole
southland
entered
into
that
gigantic
that
prolonged
and
that
disastrous
struggle
which
has
closed
but
closed
as
to
us
in
grief
sir
they
wrong
us
who
say
that
the
south
was
ever
impatient
to
rupture
the
bonds
of
the
american
union
the
war
of
which
sir
has
no
more
yet
a
written
history
than
has
the
war
of
to
tells
us
that
it
was
this
southland
that
wrought
the
revolution
of
we
were
the
heirs
of
all
the
glory
of
that
immortal
struggle
it
was
purchased
with
our
blood
with
the
blood
of
our
fathers
which
yet
flows
in
these
veins
and
which
we
desire
to
transmit
pure
and
consecrated
to
the
sons
that
are
born
to
our
loins
the
traditions
of
the
past
sixty
years
were
a
portion
of
our
heritage
and
it
never
was
easy
for
any
great
heart
and
reflective
mind
even
to
seem
to
part
with
that
heritage
to
enter
upon
the
perilous
effort
of
establishing
a
new
nationality
president
it
was
my
privilege
once
to
be
thrilled
in
a
short
speech
uttered
by
one
of
the
noblest
names
clustering
upon
the
roll
of
south
carolina
for
sir
south
carolina
was
virginia
sister
and
south
carolina
stood
by
virginia
in
the
old
struggle
as
virginia
stood
by
south
carolina
in
the
new
and
the
little
state
small
as
greece
barren
in
resources
but
great
only
in
the
grandeur
of
the
men
in
their
gigantic
proportions
whom
she
like
virginia
was
permitted
to
produce
i
heard
sir
one
of
south
carolina
noblest
sons
speak
once
thus
walked
through
the
tower
of
london
that
grand
repository
where
are
gathered
the
memorials
of
england
martial
prowess
and
when
the
guide
in
the
pride
of
his
english
heart
pointed
to
the
spoils
of
war
collected
through
centuries
of
the
past
said
this
speaker
lifting
himself
upon
tiptoe
that
he
might
reach
to
his
greatest
height
said
you
can
not
point
to
one
single
trophy
from
my
people
or
my
country
though
england
engaged
in
two
disastrous
wars
with
her
sir
this
was
the
sentiment
we
loved
every
inch
of
american
soil
and
loved
every
part
of
that
canvas
pointing
to
the
stars
and
stripes
above
him
which
as
a
symbol
of
power
and
authority
floated
from
the
spires
and
from
the
of
our
vessels
and
it
was
after
the
anguish
of
a
woman
in
birth
that
this
land
that
now
lies
in
her
sorrow
and
ruin
took
upon
herself
that
great
peril
but
it
is
all
emblematized
in
the
regret
experienced
by
him
whose
praises
are
upon
our
lips
and
who
like
the
english
nelson
recognized
duty
engraved
in
letters
of
light
as
the
only
ensign
he
could
follow
and
who
tearing
away
from
all
the
associations
of
his
early
life
and
abandoning
the
reputation
gained
in
the
old
service
made
up
his
mind
to
embark
in
the
new
and
with
that
modesty
and
that
firmness
belonging
only
to
the
truly
great
expressed
his
willingness
to
live
and
die
in
the
position
assigned
to
him
and
i
accept
this
noble
chieftain
equally
as
the
representative
of
this
southland
in
the
spirit
of
his
retirement
from
struggle
it
could
not
escape
any
speaker
upon
this
platform
to
allude
to
the
dignity
of
that
retirement
how
from
the
moment
he
surrendered
he
withdrew
from
observation
holding
aloof
from
all
political
complications
and
devoting
his
entire
energies
to
the
great
work
he
had
undertaken
to
discharge
in
this
he
represents
an
the
true
attitude
of
the
south
since
the
close
of
the
war
attitude
of
quiet
submission
to
the
conquering
power
and
of
obedience
to
all
exactions
but
without
resiling
from
those
great
principles
which
were
embalmed
in
the
struggle
and
which
as
the
convictions
of
a
lifetime
no
honest
mind
could
release
all
over
this
land
of
ours
there
are
men
like
lee
not
as
great
not
as
symmetrical
in
the
development
of
character
not
as
grand
in
the
proportions
which
they
have
reached
but
who
like
him
are
sleeping
upon
memories
that
are
holy
as
death
and
who
amid
all
reproach
appeal
to
the
future
and
to
the
tribunal
of
history
when
she
shall
render
her
final
verdict
in
reference
to
the
struggle
closed
for
the
vindication
of
the
people
embarked
in
that
struggle
we
are
silent
resigned
obedient
and
thoughtful
sleeping
upon
solemn
memories
president
but
as
said
by
the
in
the
good
book
sleep
but
my
heart
waketh
looking
upon
the
future
that
is
to
come
and
powerless
in
every
thing
except
to
pray
to
almighty
god
who
rules
the
destinies
of
nations
that
those
who
have
the
power
may
at
least
have
the
grace
given
them
to
preserve
the
constitutional
principles
which
we
have
endeavored
to
maintain
and
sir
were
it
my
privilege
to
speak
in
the
hearing
of
the
entire
nation
i
would
utter
with
the
profoundest
emphasis
this
pregnant
truth
that
no
people
ever
traversed
those
moral
ideas
which
underlie
its
character
its
constitution
its
institutions
and
its
laws
that
did
not
in
the
end
perish
in
disaster
in
shame
and
in
dishonor
whatever
be
the
glory
the
material
civilization
of
which
such
a
nation
may
boast
it
still
holds
true
that
the
truth
is
immortal
and
that
ideas
rule
the
world
and
now
i
have
but
a
single
word
to
say
and
that
is
that
the
grave
of
this
noble
hero
is
bedewed
with
the
most
tender
and
sacred
tears
ever
shed
upon
a
human
tomb
i
was
thinking
in
my
study
this
afternoon
striving
to
strike
out
something
i
might
utter
on
this
platform
and
this
parallel
between
the
first
washington
and
the
second
occurred
to
me
i
asked
my
own
heart
the
question
you
not
accept
the
fame
and
the
glory
and
the
career
of
robert
lee
just
as
soon
as
accept
the
glory
and
career
of
the
immortal
man
who
was
his
predecessor
sir
there
is
a
pathos
in
fallen
fortunes
which
stirs
the
sensibilities
and
touches
the
very
fountain
of
human
feeling
i
am
not
sure
that
at
this
moment
napoleon
the
enforced
guest
of
the
prussian
king
is
not
grander
than
when
he
ascended
the
throne
of
france
there
is
a
grandeur
in
misfortune
when
that
misfortune
is
borne
by
a
noble
heart
with
the
strength
of
will
to
endure
and
endure
without
complaining
or
breaking
perhaps
i
slip
easily
into
this
train
of
remarks
for
it
is
my
peculiar
office
to
speak
of
that
chastening
with
which
a
gracious
providence
visits
men
on
this
earth
and
by
which
he
prepares
them
for
heaven
hereafter
and
what
is
true
of
individuals
in
a
state
of
adversity
is
true
of
nations
when
clothed
in
sorrow
sir
the
men
in
these
galleries
that
once
wore
the
gray
are
here
that
they
may
bend
the
knee
in
reverence
at
the
grave
of
him
whose
voice
and
hand
they
obeyed
amid
the
storms
of
battle
the
young
widow
who
but
as
yesterday
leaned
upon
the
arm
of
her
but
now
clasps
wildly
to
her
breast
the
young
child
that
never
beheld
its
father
face
comes
here
to
shed
her
tears
over
this
grave
and
the
aged
matron
with
the
tears
streaming
from
her
eyes
as
she
recalls
her
unforgotten
dead
lying
on
the
plains
of
gettysburg
or
on
the
heights
of
fredericksburg
now
joins
in
our
dirge
over
him
who
was
that
son
chieftain
and
counsellor
and
friend
a
whole
nation
has
risen
up
in
the
spontaneity
of
its
grief
to
render
the
tribute
of
its
love
sir
there
is
a
unity
in
the
grapes
when
they
grow
together
in
the
clusters
upon
the
vine
and
holding
the
bunch
in
your
hand
you
speak
of
it
as
one
but
there
is
another
unity
when
you
throw
these
grapes
into
the
and
the
feet
of
those
that
bruise
these
grapes
trample
them
almost
profanely
beneath
their
feet
together
in
the
communion
of
pure
wine
and
such
is
the
union
and
communion
of
hearts
that
have
been
fused
by
tribulation
and
sorrow
and
that
meet
together
in
the
true
feeling
of
an
honest
grief
to
express
the
homage
of
their
affection
as
well
as
to
render
a
tribute
of
praise
to
him
upon
whose
face
we
shall
never
look
until
on
that
immortal
day
when
we
shall
behold
it
transfigured
before
the
throne
of
god
the
meeting
then
adopted
the
following
preamble
and
resolutions
like
orphans
at
the
grave
of
a
parent
untimely
snatched
away
our
hearts
have
lingered
and
brooded
with
a
grief
that
no
cunning
of
speech
could
interpret
over
the
thought
that
robert
edward
lee
exists
no
more
in
bodily
life
in
sensible
form
in
visible
presence
for
our
love
and
veneration
for
our
edification
and
guidance
for
our
comfort
and
solace
and
we
have
invoked
all
mute
funeral
emblems
to
aid
us
with
their
utmost
eloquence
of
woe
and
we
can
not
content
ourselves
with
contemplating
from
the
depth
and
the
gloom
of
our
bereavement
the
exalted
and
radiant
virtues
of
the
dead
that
we
the
people
of
new
orleans
have
come
together
under
one
common
impulse
to
render
united
homage
to
the
memory
which
holds
mastery
in
our
minds
whether
we
turn
with
bitter
regard
to
the
past
or
with
prayerful
and
chastened
aspirations
to
the
future
that
as
louisianians
as
southerners
as
americans
we
proudly
claim
our
share
in
the
fame
of
lee
as
an
inheritance
rightfully
belonging
to
us
and
endowed
with
which
we
shall
piously
cherish
though
all
calamities
should
rain
upon
us
true
poverty
the
poverty
indeed
that
abases
and
starves
the
spirit
can
never
approach
us
with
its
noisome
breath
and
withering
look
that
it
is
infinitely
more
bitter
to
have
to
mourn
the
loss
of
our
lee
than
not
to
have
learned
to
prize
him
as
the
noblest
gift
which
could
have
been
allotted
to
a
people
and
an
epoch
a
grand
man
rounded
to
the
symmetry
of
equal
moral
and
intellectual
powers
graces
and
accomplishments
a
man
whose
masterly
and
heroic
energy
left
nothing
undone
in
defending
a
just
cause
while
there
was
a
possibility
of
striking
for
it
a
rational
and
hopeful
blow
and
whose
sublime
resignation
when
the
last
blow
was
struck
in
vain
and
when
human
virtue
was
challenged
to
match
itself
with
the
consummation
of
human
adversity
taught
wiser
more
convincing
more
reassuring
more
lessons
than
were
to
be
found
in
all
the
philosophies
of
all
books
that
worthily
to
show
our
veneration
for
this
majestic
and
beautiful
character
we
must
revolve
it
habitually
in
our
thoughts
and
try
to
appropriate
it
to
the
purification
and
elevation
of
our
lives
and
so
educate
our
children
that
they
shall
if
possible
grow
up
into
its
likeness
that
while
it
is
honorable
for
a
people
to
deeply
lament
the
death
of
such
a
man
it
would
be
glorious
for
a
generation
to
mould
itself
after
his
model
for
it
would
be
a
generation
fraught
with
all
high
manly
qualities
tempered
with
all
gentle
and
christian
virtues
for
truth
love
goodness
health
strength
would
be
with
it
and
consequently
victory
liberty
majesty
and
beauty
that
we
would
hail
the
erection
of
the
proposed
monument
as
well
adapted
to
the
purpose
of
preserving
this
admirable
and
most
precious
memory
as
a
vital
and
beneficent
influence
for
all
time
to
come
and
we
will
therefore
cordially
aid
in
promoting
the
lee
monument
which
has
just
been
inaugurated
atlanta
a
crowded
meeting
assembled
in
this
city
on
october
after
an
impressive
prayer
from
the
rev
brantly
the
meeting
was
addressed
by
general
john
gordon
we
have
met
to
weep
to
mingle
our
tears
and
give
vent
to
our
bursting
hearts
the
sorrowing
south
already
clad
in
weeds
bows
her
head
afresh
in
a
orphanage
and
if
i
could
have
been
permitted
to
indulge
the
sensibilities
of
my
heart
i
would
have
fled
this
most
honorable
task
and
in
solitude
and
silence
have
wept
the
loss
of
the
great
and
good
man
whose
death
we
so
deplore
i
loved
general
lee
for
it
was
my
proud
privilege
to
know
him
well
i
loved
him
with
a
profound
and
love
with
a
sincere
and
unfaded
affection
i
say
i
would
have
retired
from
this
flattering
task
which
your
kindness
has
imposed
but
remembering
that
his
words
his
deeds
his
great
example
has
taught
us
that
duty
was
the
most
commanding
obligation
i
yield
this
morning
to
your
wishes
we
have
met
to
honor
general
lee
to
honor
him
dead
whom
we
loved
while
living
honor
general
lee
how
utterly
vain
what
a
mockery
of
language
do
these
words
seem
honor
lee
why
my
countrymen
his
deeds
have
honored
him
the
very
trump
of
fame
itself
is
proud
to
honor
him
europe
and
the
civilized
world
have
united
to
honor
him
supremely
and
history
itself
has
caught
the
echo
and
made
it
immortal
honor
lee
why
sir
as
the
sad
news
of
his
death
is
with
the
speed
of
thought
communicated
to
the
world
it
will
carry
a
pang
even
to
the
hearts
of
marshals
and
of
monarchs
and
i
can
easily
fancy
that
amid
the
din
and
clash
and
carnage
of
war
the
cannon
itself
in
mute
pause
at
the
whispering
news
will
briefly
cease
its
roar
around
the
walls
of
paris
the
task
is
not
without
pain
while
yet
his
manly
frame
lies
stretched
upon
his
bier
to
attempt
to
analyze
the
elements
that
made
him
truly
great
it
has
been
my
fortune
in
life
from
circumstances
to
have
come
in
contact
with
some
whom
the
world
pronounced
great
some
of
the
earth
celebrated
and
distinguished
but
i
declare
it
here
that
of
any
mortal
man
whom
it
has
ever
been
my
privilege
to
approach
he
was
the
greatest
and
i
assert
here
that
grand
as
might
be
your
conceptions
of
the
man
before
he
arose
in
incomparable
majesty
on
more
familiar
acquaintance
this
can
be
affirmed
of
few
men
who
have
ever
lived
or
died
and
of
no
other
man
whom
it
has
ever
been
my
fortune
to
approach
like
niagara
the
more
you
gazed
the
more
his
grandeur
grew
upon
you
the
more
his
majesty
expanded
and
filled
your
spirit
with
a
full
satisfaction
that
left
a
perfect
delight
without
the
slightest
feeling
of
oppression
grandly
majestic
and
dignified
in
all
his
deportment
he
was
genial
as
the
sunlight
of
this
beautiful
day
and
not
a
ray
of
that
cordial
social
intercourse
but
brought
warmth
to
the
heart
as
it
did
light
to
the
understanding
but
as
one
of
the
great
captains
will
general
lee
first
pass
review
and
inspection
before
the
criticism
of
history
we
will
not
compare
him
with
washington
the
mind
will
halt
instinctively
at
the
comparison
of
two
such
men
so
equally
and
gloriously
great
but
with
modest
yet
calm
and
unflinching
confidence
we
place
him
by
the
side
of
the
marlboroughs
and
wellingtons
who
take
high
niches
in
the
pantheon
of
immortality
let
us
dwell
for
a
moment
my
friends
on
this
thought
marlborough
never
met
defeat
it
is
true
victory
marked
every
step
of
his
triumphant
march
but
when
where
and
whom
did
marlborough
fight
the
ambitious
and
vain
but
able
louis
xiv
but
he
had
already
exhausted
the
resources
of
his
kingdom
before
marlborough
stepped
upon
the
stage
the
great
marshals
turenne
and
condé
were
no
more
and
luxembourg
the
beloved
had
vanished
from
the
scene
marlborough
preëminently
great
as
he
certainly
was
nevertheless
led
the
combined
forces
of
england
and
of
holland
in
the
freshness
of
their
strength
and
the
fulness
of
their
financial
ability
against
prostrate
france
with
a
treasury
depleted
a
people
worn
out
discouraged
and
dejected
but
let
us
turn
to
another
comparison
the
great
von
moltke
who
now
rides
upon
the
whirlwind
and
commands
the
storm
of
prussian
invasion
has
recently
declared
that
general
lee
in
all
respects
was
fully
the
equal
of
wellington
and
you
may
the
better
appreciate
this
admission
when
you
remember
that
wellington
was
the
benefactor
of
prussia
and
probably
von
moltke
special
idol
but
let
us
examine
the
arguments
ourselves
france
was
already
prostrate
when
wellington
met
napoleon
that
great
emperor
had
seemed
to
make
war
upon
the
very
elements
themselves
to
have
contended
with
nature
and
to
have
almost
defeated
providence
itself
the
enemies
of
the
north
more
savage
than
goth
or
vandal
mounting
the
swift
gales
of
a
russian
winter
had
carried
death
desolation
and
ruin
to
the
very
gates
of
paris
wellington
fought
at
waterloo
a
bleeding
and
broken
nation
a
nation
electrified
it
is
true
to
almost
superhuman
energy
by
the
genius
of
napoleon
but
a
nation
prostrate
and
bleeding
nevertheless
compare
this
my
friends
the
condition
of
france
and
the
condition
of
the
united
states
in
the
freshness
of
her
strength
in
the
luxuriance
of
her
resources
in
the
lustihood
of
her
gigantic
youth
tell
me
whether
to
place
the
chaplet
of
military
superiority
with
him
or
with
marlborough
or
wellington
even
the
greatest
of
captains
in
his
italian
campaigns
flashing
fame
in
lightning
splendor
over
the
world
even
bonaparte
met
and
crushed
in
battle
but
three
or
four
i
think
austrian
armies
while
our
lee
with
one
army
badly
equipped
in
time
incredibly
short
met
and
hurled
back
in
broken
and
shattered
fragments
five
of
the
greatest
prepared
and
most
magnificently
appointed
invasions
yea
more
he
discrowned
in
rapid
succession
one
after
another
of
the
united
states
most
accomplished
and
admirable
commanders
lee
was
never
really
defeated
lee
could
not
be
defeated
overpowered
foiled
in
his
efforts
he
might
be
but
never
defeated
until
the
props
which
supported
him
gave
way
never
until
the
platform
sank
beneath
him
did
any
enemy
ever
dare
pursue
on
that
melancholy
occasion
the
downfall
of
the
confederacy
no
leipsic
no
waterloo
no
sedan
can
ever
be
recorded
general
lee
is
known
to
the
world
as
a
military
man
but
it
is
easy
to
divine
from
his
history
how
mindful
of
all
just
authority
how
observant
of
all
constitutional
restriction
would
have
been
his
career
as
a
civilian
when
near
the
conclusion
of
the
war
darkness
was
thickening
about
the
falling
fortunes
of
the
confederacy
when
its
very
life
was
in
the
sword
of
lee
it
was
my
proud
privilege
to
know
with
a
special
admiration
the
modest
demeanor
the
manly
decorum
respectful
homage
which
marked
all
his
dealings
with
the
constituted
authorities
of
his
country
clothed
with
all
power
he
hid
its
very
symbol
behind
a
genial
modesty
and
refused
ever
to
exert
it
save
in
obedience
to
law
and
even
in
his
triumphant
entry
into
the
territory
of
the
enemy
so
regardful
was
he
of
civilized
warfare
that
the
observance
of
his
general
orders
as
to
private
property
and
private
rights
left
the
line
of
his
march
marked
and
marred
by
no
devastated
fields
charred
ruins
or
desolated
homes
but
it
is
in
his
private
character
or
rather
i
should
say
his
personal
emotion
and
virtue
which
his
countrymen
will
most
delight
to
consider
and
dwell
upon
his
magnanimity
transcending
all
historic
precedent
seemed
to
form
a
new
chapter
in
the
book
of
humanity
witness
that
letter
to
jackson
after
his
wounds
at
chancellorsville
in
which
he
said
am
praying
for
you
with
more
fervor
than
i
have
ever
prayed
for
myself
and
that
other
more
disinterested
and
pathetic
could
for
the
good
of
my
country
wish
that
the
wounds
which
you
have
received
had
been
inflicted
upon
my
own
body
or
that
of
the
latter
message
saying
to
general
jackson
that
wounds
were
not
so
severe
as
mine
for
he
loses
but
his
left
arm
while
i
in
my
loss
lose
my
right
or
that
other
expression
of
unequalled
magnanimity
which
enabled
him
to
ascribe
the
glory
of
their
joint
victory
to
the
sole
credit
of
the
dying
hero
did
i
say
unequalled
yes
that
was
an
avowal
of
unequalled
magnanimity
until
it
met
its
parallel
in
his
own
grander
in
assuming
the
sole
responsibility
for
the
defeat
at
gettysburg
ay
my
countrymen
alexander
had
his
arbela
caesar
his
pharsalia
napoleon
his
austerlitz
but
it
was
reserved
for
lee
to
grow
grander
and
more
illustrious
in
defeat
than
even
in
victory
grander
because
in
defeat
he
showed
a
spirit
greater
than
in
the
heroism
of
battles
or
all
the
achievements
of
war
a
spirit
which
crowns
him
with
a
chaplet
grander
far
than
ever
mighty
conqueror
wore
i
turn
me
now
to
that
last
closing
scene
at
appomattox
and
i
will
draw
thence
a
picture
of
that
man
as
he
laid
aside
the
sword
the
unrivalled
soldier
to
become
the
most
exemplary
of
citizens
i
can
never
forget
the
deferential
homage
paid
this
great
citizen
by
even
the
federal
soldiers
as
with
uncovered
heads
they
contemplated
in
mute
admiration
this
now
captive
hero
as
he
rode
through
their
ranks
impressed
forever
daguerreotyped
on
my
heart
is
that
last
parting
scene
with
that
handful
of
heroes
still
crowding
around
him
few
indeed
were
the
words
then
spoken
but
the
quivering
lip
and
the
tearful
eye
told
of
the
love
they
bore
him
in
symphonies
more
eloquent
than
any
language
can
describe
can
i
ever
forget
no
never
can
i
forget
the
words
which
fell
from
his
lips
as
i
rode
beside
him
amid
the
defeated
dejected
and
weeping
soldiery
when
turning
to
me
he
said
could
wish
that
i
was
numbered
among
the
fallen
in
the
last
battle
but
oh
as
he
thought
of
the
loss
of
the
cause
of
the
many
dead
scattered
over
so
many
fields
who
sleeping
neglected
with
no
governmental
arms
to
gather
up
their
remains
sleeping
neglected
isolated
and
alone
beneath
the
weeping
stars
with
naught
but
their
soldiers
blankets
about
them
oh
as
these
emotions
swept
over
his
great
soul
he
felt
that
he
would
have
laid
him
down
to
rest
in
the
same
grave
where
lay
buried
the
common
hope
of
his
people
but
providence
willed
it
otherwise
he
rests
now
forever
my
countrymen
his
spirit
in
the
bosom
of
that
father
whom
he
so
faithfully
served
his
body
beside
the
river
whose
banks
are
forever
memorable
and
whose
waters
are
vocal
with
the
glories
of
his
triumphs
no
sound
shall
ever
wake
him
to
martial
glory
again
no
more
shall
he
lead
his
invincible
lines
to
victory
no
more
shall
we
gaze
upon
him
and
draw
from
his
quiet
demeanor
lessons
of
life
but
oh
it
is
a
sweet
consolation
to
us
my
countrymen
who
loved
him
that
no
more
shall
his
bright
spirit
be
bowed
down
to
earth
with
the
burdens
of
the
people
wrongs
it
is
sweet
consolation
to
us
that
his
last
victory
through
faith
in
his
crucified
redeemer
is
the
most
transcendently
glorious
of
all
his
triumphs
at
this
very
hour
while
we
mourn
here
kind
friends
are
consigning
the
last
that
remains
of
our
hero
to
his
quiet
surrounded
by
the
mountains
of
his
native
state
mountains
the
autumnal
glory
of
whose
magnificent
forests
seem
but
habiliments
of
mourning
in
the
valley
the
pearly
seem
but
tears
of
sadness
upon
the
grasses
and
flowers
let
him
rest
and
now
as
he
has
gone
from
us
and
as
we
regard
him
in
all
the
aspects
of
his
career
and
character
and
attainments
as
a
great
captain
ranking
among
the
first
of
any
age
as
a
patriot
whose
sacrificing
devotion
to
his
country
ranks
him
with
washington
as
a
christian
like
havelock
recognizing
his
duty
to
his
god
above
every
other
earthly
consideration
with
a
native
modesty
that
refused
to
appropriate
the
glory
of
his
own
and
which
surrounds
now
his
entire
character
and
career
with
a
halo
of
unfading
light
with
an
integrity
of
life
and
a
sacred
regard
for
truth
which
no
man
dare
assail
with
a
fidelity
to
principle
which
no
misfortune
could
shake
he
must
ever
stand
peerless
among
men
in
the
estimation
of
christendom
this
representative
son
of
the
south
robert
lee
of
virginia
richmond
a
meeting
was
held
on
november
presided
over
by
jefferson
davis
davis
delivered
an
address
of
which
we
regret
that
we
have
received
no
complete
copy
we
give
it
as
reported
in
the
richmond
remarks
of
president
davis
as
davis
arose
to
walk
to
the
stand
every
person
in
the
house
stood
and
there
followed
such
a
storm
of
applause
as
seemed
to
shake
the
very
foundations
of
the
building
while
cheer
upon
cheer
was
echoed
from
the
throats
of
veterans
saluting
one
whom
they
delighted
to
honor
davis
spoke
at
length
and
with
his
accustomed
thrilling
moving
eloquence
we
shall
not
attempt
at
the
late
hour
at
which
we
write
to
give
a
full
report
of
his
address
he
addressed
his
hearers
as
soldiers
and
sailors
of
the
confederacy
comrades
and
friends
assembled
on
this
sad
occasion
with
hearts
oppressed
with
the
grief
that
follows
the
loss
of
him
who
was
our
leader
on
many
a
bloody
a
pleasing
though
melancholy
spectacle
is
presented
hitherto
and
in
all
times
men
have
been
honored
when
successful
but
here
is
the
case
of
one
who
amid
disaster
went
down
to
his
grave
and
those
who
were
his
companions
in
misfortune
have
assembled
to
honor
his
memory
it
is
as
much
an
honor
to
you
who
give
as
to
him
who
receives
for
above
the
vulgar
test
of
merit
you
show
yourselves
competent
to
discriminate
between
him
who
enjoys
and
him
who
deserves
success
robert
lee
was
my
associate
and
friend
in
the
military
academy
and
we
were
friends
until
the
hour
of
his
death
we
were
associates
and
friends
when
he
was
a
soldier
and
i
a
congressman
and
associates
and
friends
when
he
led
the
armies
of
the
confederacy
and
i
presided
in
its
cabinet
we
passed
through
many
sad
scenes
together
but
i
can
not
remember
that
there
was
ever
aught
but
perfect
harmony
between
us
if
ever
there
was
difference
of
opinion
it
was
dissipated
by
discussion
and
harmony
was
the
result
i
repeat
never
and
i
may
add
that
i
never
in
my
life
saw
in
him
the
slightest
tendency
to
it
was
not
his
to
make
a
record
it
was
not
his
to
shift
blame
to
other
shoulders
but
it
was
his
with
an
eye
fixed
upon
the
welfare
of
his
country
never
faltering
to
follow
the
line
of
duty
to
the
end
his
was
the
heart
that
braved
every
difficulty
his
was
the
mind
that
wrought
victory
out
of
defeat
he
has
been
charged
with
of
dash
i
wish
to
say
that
i
never
knew
lee
to
falter
to
attempt
any
thing
ever
man
could
dare
an
attempt
has
also
been
made
to
throw
a
cloud
upon
his
character
because
he
left
the
army
of
the
united
states
to
join
in
the
struggle
for
the
liberty
of
his
state
without
trenching
at
all
upon
politics
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
say
one
word
in
reference
to
this
charge
virginian
born
descended
from
a
family
illustrious
in
virginia
annals
given
by
virginia
to
the
service
of
the
united
states
he
represented
her
in
the
military
academy
at
west
point
he
was
not
educated
by
the
federal
government
but
by
virginia
for
she
paid
her
full
share
for
the
support
of
that
institution
and
was
entitled
to
demand
in
return
the
services
of
her
sons
entering
the
army
of
the
united
states
he
represented
virginia
there
also
and
nobly
on
many
a
field
lee
was
conspicuous
battling
for
his
native
state
as
much
as
for
the
union
he
came
from
mexico
crowned
with
honors
covered
by
brevets
and
recognized
young
as
he
was
as
one
of
the
ablest
of
his
country
soldiers
and
to
prove
that
he
was
estimated
then
as
such
let
me
tell
you
that
when
lee
was
a
captain
of
engineers
stationed
in
baltimore
the
cuban
junta
in
new
york
selected
him
to
be
their
leader
in
the
struggle
for
the
independence
of
their
native
country
they
were
anxious
to
secure
his
services
and
offered
him
every
temptation
that
ambition
could
desire
he
thought
the
matter
over
and
i
remember
came
to
washington
to
consult
me
as
to
what
he
should
do
and
when
i
began
to
discuss
the
complications
which
might
arise
from
his
acceptance
of
the
trust
he
gently
rebuked
me
saying
that
this
was
not
the
line
upon
which
he
wished
my
advice
the
simple
question
was
it
was
right
or
not
he
had
been
educated
by
the
united
states
and
felt
wrong
to
accept
a
place
in
the
army
of
a
foreign
power
such
was
his
extreme
delicacy
such
was
the
nice
sense
of
honor
of
the
gallant
gentleman
whose
death
we
deplore
but
when
virginia
withdrew
the
state
to
whom
he
owed
his
first
and
last
allegiance
the
same
nice
sense
of
honor
led
him
to
draw
his
sword
and
throw
it
in
the
scale
for
good
or
for
evil
pardon
me
for
this
brief
defence
of
my
illustrious
friend
when
virginia
joined
the
confederacy
robert
lee
the
highest
officer
in
the
little
army
of
virginia
came
to
richmond
and
not
pausing
to
inquire
what
would
be
his
rank
in
the
service
of
the
confederacy
went
to
western
virginia
under
the
belief
that
he
was
still
an
officer
of
the
state
he
came
back
carrying
the
heavy
weight
of
defeat
and
unappreciated
by
the
people
whom
he
served
for
they
could
not
know
as
i
knew
that
if
his
plans
and
orders
had
been
carried
out
the
result
would
have
been
victory
rather
than
retreat
you
did
not
know
for
i
would
not
have
known
it
had
he
not
breathed
it
in
my
ear
only
at
my
earnest
request
and
begging
that
nothing
be
said
about
it
the
clamor
which
then
arose
followed
him
when
he
went
to
south
carolina
so
that
it
became
necessary
on
his
going
to
south
carolina
to
write
a
letter
to
the
governor
of
that
state
telling
him
what
manner
of
man
he
was
yet
through
all
this
with
a
magnanimity
rarely
equalled
he
stood
in
silence
without
defending
himself
or
allowing
others
to
defend
him
for
he
was
unwilling
to
offend
any
one
who
was
wearing
a
sword
and
striking
blows
for
the
confederacy
davis
then
spoke
of
the
straits
to
which
the
confederacy
was
reduced
and
of
the
danger
to
which
her
capital
was
exposed
just
after
the
battle
of
seven
pines
and
told
how
general
lee
had
conceived
and
executed
the
desperate
plan
to
turn
their
flank
and
rear
which
after
seven
days
of
bloody
battle
was
crowned
with
the
protection
of
richmond
while
the
enemy
was
driven
far
from
the
city
the
speaker
referred
also
to
the
circumstances
attending
general
crossing
the
potomac
on
the
march
into
pennsylvania
he
davis
assumed
the
responsibility
of
that
movement
the
enemy
had
long
been
concentrating
his
force
and
it
was
evident
that
if
he
continued
his
steady
progress
the
confederacy
would
be
overwhelmed
our
only
hope
was
to
drive
him
to
the
defence
of
his
own
capital
we
being
enabled
in
the
mean
time
to
reënforce
our
shattered
army
how
well
general
lee
carried
out
that
dangerous
experiment
need
not
be
told
richmond
was
relieved
the
confederacy
was
relieved
and
time
was
obtained
if
other
things
had
favored
to
reënforce
the
army
but
said
davis
i
shall
not
attempt
to
review
the
military
career
of
our
fallen
chieftain
of
the
man
how
shall
i
speak
he
was
my
friend
and
in
that
word
is
included
all
that
i
could
say
of
any
man
his
moral
qualities
rose
to
the
height
of
his
genius
always
intent
upon
the
one
idea
of
duty
to
an
extent
that
many
thought
him
cold
his
feelings
were
really
warm
and
his
heart
melted
freely
at
the
sight
of
a
wounded
soldier
or
the
story
of
the
sufferings
of
the
widow
and
orphan
during
the
war
he
was
ever
conscious
of
the
inequality
of
the
means
at
his
control
but
it
was
never
his
to
complain
or
to
utter
a
doubt
it
was
always
his
to
do
when
in
the
last
campaign
he
was
beleaguered
at
petersburg
and
painfully
aware
of
the
straits
to
which
we
were
reduced
he
said
my
army
in
the
mountains
of
virginia
i
could
carry
on
this
war
for
twenty
years
longer
his
men
exhausted
and
his
supplies
failing
he
was
unable
to
carry
out
his
plans
an
untoward
event
caused
him
to
anticipate
the
movement
and
the
army
of
northern
virginia
was
overwhelmed
but
in
the
surrender
he
anticipated
conditions
that
have
not
been
fulfilled
he
expected
his
army
to
be
respected
and
his
paroled
soldiers
to
be
allowed
the
enjoyments
of
life
and
property
whether
these
conditions
have
been
fulfilled
let
others
say
here
he
now
sleeps
in
the
land
he
loved
so
well
and
that
land
is
not
virginia
only
for
they
do
injustice
to
lee
who
believe
he
fought
only
for
virginia
he
was
ready
to
go
anywhere
on
any
service
for
the
good
of
his
country
and
his
heart
was
as
broad
as
the
fifteen
states
struggling
for
the
principles
that
our
forefathers
fought
for
in
the
revolution
of
he
is
sleeping
in
the
same
soil
with
the
thousands
who
fought
under
the
same
flag
but
first
offered
up
their
lives
here
the
living
are
assembled
to
honor
his
memory
and
there
the
skeleton
sentinels
keep
watch
over
his
grave
this
citizen
this
soldier
this
great
general
this
true
patriot
left
behind
him
the
crowning
glory
of
a
true
christian
his
christianity
ennobled
him
in
life
and
affords
us
grounds
for
the
belief
that
he
is
happy
beyond
the
grave
but
while
we
mourn
the
loss
of
the
great
and
the
true
drop
we
also
tears
of
sympathy
with
her
who
was
his
helpmeet
the
noble
woman
who
while
her
husband
was
in
the
field
leading
the
army
of
the
confederacy
though
an
invalid
herself
passed
the
time
in
knitting
socks
for
the
marching
soldiers
a
woman
fit
to
be
the
mother
of
heroes
and
heroes
are
descended
from
her
mourning
with
her
we
can
only
offer
the
consolation
of
a
christian
our
loss
is
not
his
but
he
now
enjoys
the
rewards
of
a
life
well
spent
and
a
trust
in
a
risen
saviour
this
day
we
unite
our
words
of
sorrow
with
those
of
the
good
and
great
throughout
christendom
for
his
fame
is
gone
over
the
water
his
deeds
will
be
remembered
and
when
the
monument
we
build
shall
have
crumbled
into
dust
his
virtues
will
still
live
a
high
model
for
the
imitation
of
generations
yet
unborn
we
have
given
but
a
faint
idea
of
the
eloquent
thoughts
and
chaste
oratory
of
the
speaker
his
words
were
heard
with
profound
attention
and
received
with
frequent
applause
memorial
resolutions
colonel
venable
then
presented
the
following
report
of
the
committee
on
resolutions
it
is
a
high
and
holy
duty
as
well
as
a
noble
privilege
to
perpetuate
the
honors
of
those
who
have
displayed
eminent
virtues
and
performed
great
achievements
that
they
may
serve
as
incentives
and
examples
to
the
latest
generation
of
their
countrymen
and
attest
the
reverential
admiration
and
affectionate
regard
of
their
compatriots
and
this
duty
and
privilege
devolve
on
all
who
love
and
admire
general
robert
lee
throughout
this
country
and
the
world
and
in
an
especial
manner
upon
those
who
followed
him
in
the
field
or
who
fought
in
the
same
cause
who
shared
in
his
glories
partook
of
his
trials
and
were
united
with
him
in
the
same
sorrows
and
adversity
who
were
devoted
to
him
in
war
by
the
baptism
of
fire
and
blood
and
bound
to
him
in
peace
by
the
still
higher
homage
due
to
the
rare
and
grand
exhibition
of
a
character
pure
and
lofty
and
gentle
and
true
under
all
changes
of
fortune
and
serene
amid
the
greatest
disasters
therefore
be
it
that
we
favor
an
association
to
erect
a
monument
at
richmond
to
the
memory
of
robert
lee
as
an
enduring
testimonial
of
our
love
and
respect
and
devotion
to
his
fame
that
while
donations
will
be
gladly
received
from
all
who
recognize
in
the
excellences
of
general
lee
character
an
honor
and
an
encouragement
to
our
common
humanity
and
an
abiding
hope
that
coming
generations
may
be
found
to
imitate
his
virtues
it
is
desirable
that
every
confederate
soldier
and
sailor
should
make
some
contribution
however
small
to
the
proposed
monument
that
for
the
purpose
of
securing
efficiency
and
dispatch
in
the
erection
of
the
monument
an
executive
committee
of
with
a
president
secretary
treasurer
auditor
be
appointed
to
invite
and
collect
subscriptions
to
procure
designs
for
said
monument
to
select
the
best
to
provide
for
the
organization
of
central
executive
committees
in
other
states
which
may
serve
as
mediums
of
communication
between
the
executive
committee
of
the
association
and
the
local
associations
of
these
states
that
we
respectfully
invite
the
ladies
of
the
hollywood
association
to
lend
us
their
assistance
and
coöperation
in
the
collection
of
subscriptions
that
we
cordially
approve
of
the
local
monument
now
proposed
to
be
erected
by
other
associations
at
atlanta
and
at
lexington
his
last
home
whose
people
were
so
closely
united
with
him
in
the
last
sad
years
of
his
life
that
while
we
cordially
thank
the
governor
and
legislature
of
virginia
for
the
steps
they
have
taken
to
do
honor
to
the
memory
of
general
lee
yet
in
deference
to
the
wishes
of
his
loved
and
venerated
widow
with
whom
we
mourn
we
will
not
discuss
the
question
of
the
most
fitting
for
his
remains
but
will
content
ourselves
with
expressing
the
earnest
desire
and
hope
that
at
some
future
proper
time
they
will
be
committed
to
the
charge
of
this
association
generals
john
preston
john
gordon
henry
a
wise
and
william
henry
preston
and
colonels
robert
withers
and
charles
marshall
delivered
eloquent
and
appropriate
speeches
and
argued
that
richmond
is
the
proper
place
for
the
final
interment
of
the
remains
of
general
lee
the
resolutions
were
adopted
and
the
meeting
adjourned
columbia
at
a
meeting
in
this
city
the
following
remarks
were
made
by
general
wade
hampton
we
are
called
together
by
an
announcement
which
will
cause
profound
sorrow
throughout
the
civilized
world
and
which
comes
to
us
bearing
the
additional
grief
of
a
personal
and
private
bereavement
the
foremost
man
in
all
the
world
is
no
more
and
as
that
news
is
carried
by
the
speed
of
lightning
through
every
town
village
and
hamlet
of
this
land
which
he
loved
so
well
and
among
those
people
who
loved
and
honored
and
venerated
him
so
profoundly
every
true
heart
in
the
stricken
south
will
feel
that
the
country
has
lost
its
pride
and
glory
and
that
the
citizens
of
that
country
have
lost
a
father
i
dare
not
venture
to
speak
of
him
as
i
feel
nor
do
we
come
to
eulogize
him
not
only
wherever
the
english
language
is
spoken
but
wherever
civilization
extends
the
sorrow
a
part
at
least
of
the
sorrow
we
feel
will
be
felt
and
more
eloquent
tongues
than
mine
will
tell
the
fame
and
recount
the
virtues
of
robert
lee
we
need
not
come
to
praise
him
we
come
only
to
express
our
sympathy
our
grief
our
bereavement
we
come
not
to
mourn
him
for
we
know
that
it
is
well
with
him
we
come
only
to
extend
our
sympathy
to
those
who
are
bereaved
now
that
he
is
fallen
i
may
mention
what
i
have
never
spoken
of
before
to
show
you
not
only
what
were
the
feelings
that
actuated
him
in
the
duty
to
which
his
beloved
countrymen
called
him
but
what
noble
sentiments
inspired
him
when
he
saw
the
cause
for
which
he
had
been
fighting
so
long
about
to
perish
just
before
the
surrender
after
a
night
devoted
to
the
most
arduous
duties
as
one
of
his
staff
came
in
to
see
him
in
the
morning
he
found
him
worn
and
weary
and
disheartened
and
the
general
said
to
him
easily
i
could
get
rid
of
this
and
be
at
rest
i
have
only
to
ride
along
the
line
and
all
will
be
over
but
said
he
and
there
spoke
the
christian
patriot
is
our
duty
to
for
what
will
become
of
the
women
and
children
of
the
south
if
we
are
not
here
to
protect
them
that
same
spirit
of
duty
which
had
actuated
him
through
all
the
perils
and
all
the
hardships
of
that
unequalled
conflict
which
he
had
waged
so
heroically
that
same
high
spirit
of
duty
told
him
that
he
must
live
to
show
that
he
was
great
greater
if
that
were
possible
in
peace
than
in
war
live
to
teach
the
people
whom
he
had
before
led
to
victory
how
to
bear
defeat
live
to
show
what
a
great
and
good
man
can
accomplish
live
to
set
an
example
to
his
people
for
all
time
live
to
bear
if
nothing
else
his
share
of
the
sorrows
and
the
afflictions
and
the
troubles
which
had
come
upon
his
people
he
is
now
at
rest
and
surely
we
of
the
south
can
say
of
him
as
we
say
of
his
great
exemplar
the
of
his
country
that
was
first
in
war
first
in
peace
and
first
in
the
hearts
of
his
countrymen
baltimore
at
a
meeting
of
the
officers
and
soldiers
who
served
under
general
lee
held
in
this
city
on
october
a
number
of
addresses
were
made
which
we
are
compelled
to
somewhat
condense
that
of
colonel
marshall
general
lee
chief
of
staff
was
as
follows
colonel
charles
marshall
in
presenting
the
resolutions
of
the
committee
i
can
not
refrain
from
expressing
the
feelings
inspired
by
the
memories
that
crowd
upon
my
mind
when
i
reflect
that
these
resolutions
are
intended
to
express
what
general
lee
surviving
soldiers
feel
toward
general
lee
the
committee
are
fully
aware
of
their
inability
to
do
justice
to
the
sentiments
that
inspire
the
hearts
of
those
for
whom
they
speak
how
can
we
portray
in
words
the
gratitude
the
pride
the
veneration
the
anguish
that
now
fill
the
hearts
of
those
who
shared
his
victories
and
his
reverses
his
triumphs
and
his
defeats
how
can
we
tell
the
world
what
we
can
only
feel
ourselves
how
can
we
give
expression
to
the
crowding
memories
called
forth
by
the
sad
event
we
are
met
to
deplore
we
recall
him
as
he
appeared
in
the
hour
of
victory
grand
imposing
yet
and
humble
we
recall
the
great
scenes
of
his
triumph
when
we
hailed
him
victor
on
many
a
bloody
field
and
when
above
the
paeans
of
victory
we
listened
with
reverence
to
his
voice
as
he
ascribed
glory
to
the
lord
of
hosts
from
whom
all
glories
are
we
remember
that
grand
magnanimity
that
never
stooped
to
pluck
those
meaner
things
that
grew
nearest
the
earth
upon
the
tree
of
victory
but
which
with
eyes
turned
toward
the
stars
and
hands
raised
toward
heaven
gathered
the
golden
fruits
of
mercy
pity
and
holy
charity
that
ripen
on
its
topmost
boughs
beneath
the
approving
smile
of
the
great
god
of
battles
we
remember
the
sublime
of
chancellorsville
when
in
the
midst
of
his
victorious
legions
who
with
the
light
of
battle
yet
on
their
faces
hailed
him
conqueror
he
thought
only
of
his
great
lieutenant
lying
wounded
on
the
field
and
transferred
to
him
all
the
honor
of
that
illustrious
day
i
will
be
pardoned
i
am
sure
for
referring
to
an
incident
which
affords
to
my
mind
a
most
striking
illustration
of
one
of
the
grandest
features
of
his
character
on
the
morning
of
may
as
many
of
you
will
remember
the
final
assault
was
made
upon
the
federal
lines
at
chancellorsville
general
lee
accompanied
the
troops
in
person
and
as
they
emerged
from
the
fierce
combat
they
had
waged
in
depths
of
that
tangled
wilderness
driving
the
superior
forces
of
the
enemy
before
them
across
the
open
ground
he
rode
into
their
midst
the
scene
is
one
that
can
never
be
effaced
from
the
minds
of
those
who
witnessed
it
the
troops
were
pressing
forward
with
all
the
ardor
and
enthusiasm
of
combat
the
white
smoke
of
musketry
fringed
the
front
of
the
line
of
battle
while
the
artillery
on
the
hills
in
the
rear
of
the
infantry
shook
the
earth
with
its
thunder
and
filled
the
air
with
the
wild
shrieks
of
the
shells
that
plunged
into
the
masses
of
the
retreating
foe
to
add
greater
horror
and
sublimity
to
the
scene
the
chancellorsville
house
and
the
woods
surrounding
it
were
wrapped
in
flames
in
the
midst
of
this
awful
scene
general
lee
mounted
upon
that
horse
which
we
all
remember
so
well
rode
to
the
front
of
his
advancing
battalions
his
presence
was
the
signal
for
one
of
those
uncontrollable
outbursts
of
enthusiasm
which
none
can
appreciate
who
have
not
witnessed
them
the
fierce
soldiers
with
their
faces
blackened
with
the
smoke
of
battle
the
wounded
crawling
with
feeble
limbs
from
the
fury
of
the
devouring
flames
all
seemed
possessed
with
a
common
impulse
one
long
unbroken
cheer
in
which
the
feeble
cry
of
those
who
lay
helpless
on
the
earth
blended
with
the
strong
voices
of
those
who
still
fought
rose
high
above
the
roar
of
battle
and
hailed
the
presence
of
the
victorious
chief
he
sat
in
the
full
realization
of
all
that
soldiers
dream
of
triumph
and
as
i
looked
upon
him
in
the
complete
fruition
of
the
success
which
his
genius
courage
and
confidence
in
his
army
had
won
i
thought
it
must
have
been
from
some
such
scene
that
men
in
ancient
days
ascended
to
the
dignity
of
the
gods
his
first
care
was
for
the
wounded
of
both
armies
and
he
was
among
the
foremost
at
the
burning
mansion
where
some
of
them
lay
but
at
that
moment
when
the
transports
of
his
victorious
troops
were
drowning
the
roar
of
battle
with
acclamations
a
note
was
brought
to
him
from
general
jackson
it
was
brought
to
general
lee
as
he
sat
on
his
horse
near
the
chancellorsville
house
and
unable
to
open
it
with
his
gauntleted
hands
he
passed
it
to
me
with
directions
to
read
it
to
him
the
note
made
no
mention
of
the
wound
that
general
jackson
had
received
but
congratulated
general
lee
upon
the
great
victory
i
shall
never
forget
the
look
of
pain
and
anguish
that
passed
over
his
face
as
he
listened
with
a
voice
broken
with
emotion
he
bade
me
say
to
general
jackson
that
the
victory
was
his
and
that
the
congratulations
were
due
to
him
i
know
not
how
others
may
regard
this
incident
but
for
myself
as
i
gave
expression
to
the
thoughts
of
his
exalted
mind
i
forgot
the
genius
that
won
the
day
in
my
reverence
for
the
generosity
that
refused
its
glory
there
is
one
other
incident
to
which
i
beg
permission
to
refer
that
i
may
perfect
the
picture
on
the
day
of
july
the
last
assault
of
the
confederate
troops
upon
the
heights
of
gettysburg
failed
and
again
general
lee
was
among
his
baffled
and
shattered
battalions
as
they
sullenly
retired
from
their
brave
attempt
the
history
of
that
battle
is
yet
to
be
written
and
the
responsibility
for
the
result
is
yet
to
be
fixed
but
there
with
the
painful
consciousness
that
his
plans
had
been
frustrated
by
others
and
that
defeat
and
humiliation
had
overtaken
his
army
in
the
presence
of
his
troops
he
openly
assumed
the
entire
responsibility
of
the
campaign
and
of
the
lost
battle
one
word
from
him
would
have
relieved
him
of
this
responsibility
but
that
word
he
refused
to
utter
until
it
could
be
spoken
without
fear
of
doing
the
least
injustice
thus
my
i
have
presented
to
you
our
great
commander
in
the
supreme
moments
of
triumph
and
defeat
i
can
not
more
strongly
illustrate
his
character
has
it
been
surpassed
in
history
is
there
another
instance
of
such
among
men
the
man
rose
high
above
victory
in
one
instance
and
harder
still
the
man
rose
superior
to
disaster
in
the
other
it
was
such
incidents
as
these
that
gave
general
lee
the
absolute
and
undoubting
confidence
and
affection
of
his
soldiers
need
i
speak
of
the
many
exhibitions
of
that
confidence
you
all
remember
them
my
comrades
have
you
not
seen
a
wavering
line
restored
by
the
magic
of
his
presence
have
you
not
seen
the
few
forget
that
they
were
fighting
against
the
many
because
he
was
among
the
few
but
i
pass
from
the
contemplation
of
his
greatness
in
war
to
look
to
his
example
under
the
oppressive
circumstances
of
final
failure
to
look
to
that
example
to
which
it
is
most
useful
for
us
now
to
refer
for
our
guidance
and
instruction
when
the
attempt
to
establish
the
southern
confederacy
had
failed
and
the
event
of
the
war
seemed
to
have
established
the
indivisibility
of
the
federal
union
general
lee
gave
his
adhesion
to
the
new
order
of
things
his
was
no
hollow
truce
but
with
the
pure
faith
and
honor
that
marked
every
act
of
his
illustrious
career
he
immediately
devoted
himself
to
the
restoration
of
peace
harmony
and
concord
he
entered
zealously
into
the
subject
of
education
believing
as
he
often
declared
that
popular
education
is
the
only
sure
foundation
of
free
government
he
gave
his
earnest
support
to
all
plans
of
internal
improvements
designed
to
bind
more
firmly
together
the
social
and
commercial
interests
of
the
country
and
among
the
last
acts
of
his
life
was
the
effort
to
secure
the
construction
of
a
line
of
railway
communication
of
incalculable
importance
as
a
connecting
link
between
the
north
and
the
south
he
devoted
all
his
great
energies
to
the
advancement
of
the
welfare
of
his
countrymen
while
shrinking
from
public
notice
and
sought
to
lay
deep
and
strong
the
foundations
of
government
which
it
was
supposed
would
rise
from
the
ruins
of
the
old
but
i
need
not
repeat
to
you
my
comrades
the
history
of
his
life
since
the
war
you
have
watched
it
to
its
close
and
you
know
how
faithfully
and
truly
he
performed
every
duty
of
his
position
let
us
take
to
heart
the
lesson
of
his
bright
example
disregarding
all
that
malice
may
impute
to
us
with
an
eye
single
to
the
faithful
performance
of
our
duties
as
american
citizens
and
with
an
honest
and
sincere
resolution
to
support
with
heart
and
hand
the
honor
the
safety
and
the
true
liberties
of
our
country
let
us
invoke
our
to
forget
the
animosities
of
the
past
by
the
side
of
this
honored
grave
and
hands
around
this
royal
corpse
friends
now
enemies
no
more
proclaim
perpetual
truce
to
battle
the
following
are
among
the
resolutions
the
officers
soldiers
and
sailors
of
the
southern
confederacy
residing
in
maryland
who
served
under
general
lee
desiring
to
record
their
grief
for
his
death
their
admiration
for
his
exalted
virtues
and
their
affectionate
veneration
for
his
illustrious
memory
that
leaving
with
pride
the
name
and
fame
of
our
illustrious
commander
to
the
judgment
of
history
we
who
followed
him
through
the
trials
dangers
and
hardships
of
a
sanguinary
and
protracted
war
who
have
felt
the
inspiration
of
his
genius
and
valor
in
the
time
of
trial
who
have
witnessed
his
magnanimity
and
moderation
in
the
hour
of
victory
and
his
firmness
and
fortitude
in
defeat
claim
the
privilege
of
laying
the
tribute
of
our
sorrow
upon
his
honored
grave
that
the
confidence
and
admiration
which
his
eminent
achievements
deserved
and
received
were
strengthened
by
the
noble
example
of
his
constancy
in
adversity
and
that
we
honored
and
revered
him
in
his
retirement
as
we
trusted
and
followed
him
on
the
field
of
battle
that
as
a
token
of
respect
and
sorrow
we
will
wear
the
customary
badge
of
mourning
for
thirty
days
that
a
copy
of
these
resolutions
and
of
the
proceedings
of
this
meeting
be
transmitted
to
the
family
of
our
lamented
chief
on
the
of
october
a
meeting
was
held
to
appoint
delegates
to
represent
the
state
of
maryland
at
the
richmond
lee
monumental
convention
after
some
brief
remarks
by
general
trimble
and
the
adoption
of
resolutions
constituting
the
lee
monument
association
of
maryland
the
hon
reverdy
johnson
addressed
the
meeting
as
follows
hon
reverdy
johnson
chairman
and
i
am
here
in
compliance
with
the
request
of
many
gentlemen
present
and
i
not
only
willingly
complied
with
that
request
but
i
am
willing
to
do
all
i
am
able
to
show
my
appreciation
of
the
character
civil
and
military
of
robert
lee
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
know
him
before
the
mexican
war
in
those
better
days
before
the
commencement
of
the
sad
struggle
through
which
we
have
recently
passed
i
saw
in
him
every
thing
that
could
command
the
respect
and
admiration
of
men
and
i
watched
with
peculiar
interest
his
course
in
the
mexican
war
it
was
also
my
good
fortune
to
know
the
late
scott
in
the
commencement
of
the
struggle
to
which
i
have
alluded
i
occupied
in
washington
the
position
of
military
adviser
to
him
and
was
in
that
capacity
intimately
associated
with
him
i
have
heard
him
often
declare
that
the
glorious
and
continued
success
which
crowned
our
arms
in
the
war
with
mexico
was
owing
in
a
large
measure
to
the
skill
valor
and
undaunted
courage
of
robert
lee
he
entertained
for
him
the
warmest
personal
friendship
and
it
was
his
purpose
to
recommend
him
as
his
successor
in
the
event
of
his
death
or
inability
to
perform
the
duties
of
his
high
position
in
april
after
the
commencement
of
hostilities
between
the
two
great
sections
of
our
country
general
lee
then
of
cavalry
in
the
army
of
the
united
states
offered
his
resignation
i
was
with
general
scott
when
he
was
handed
the
letter
of
resignation
and
i
saw
what
pain
the
fact
caused
him
while
he
regretted
the
step
his
most
valuable
officer
had
taken
he
never
failed
to
say
emphatically
and
over
and
over
again
that
he
believed
he
had
taken
it
from
imperative
sense
of
he
was
also
consoled
by
the
belief
that
if
he
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
armies
of
the
then
confederation
he
would
have
in
him
a
foeman
in
every
way
worthy
of
him
and
one
who
would
conduct
the
war
upon
the
highest
principles
of
civilized
warfare
and
that
he
would
not
suffer
encroachments
to
be
made
upon
the
rights
of
private
property
and
the
rights
of
unoffending
citizens
some
may
be
surprised
that
i
am
here
to
eulogize
robert
lee
it
is
well
known
that
i
did
not
agree
with
him
in
his
political
views
at
the
beginning
of
the
late
war
and
for
many
years
preceding
it
even
from
the
foundation
of
this
government
two
great
questions
agitated
the
greatest
minds
of
this
country
many
believed
that
the
allegiance
of
the
citizen
was
due
first
to
his
state
and
many
were
of
the
opinion
that
according
to
the
true
reading
of
the
constitution
a
state
had
no
right
to
leave
the
union
and
claim
sovereign
rights
and
the
perpetual
allegiance
of
her
citizens
i
did
not
agree
in
the
opinion
but
i
knew
it
was
honestly
entertained
i
knew
men
of
the
purest
character
of
the
highest
ability
and
of
the
most
liberal
and
patriotic
feelings
who
conscientiously
believed
it
now
the
war
is
over
thank
god
and
to
that
thank
i
am
sure
this
meeting
will
respond
it
is
the
duty
of
every
citizen
of
this
land
to
seek
to
heal
the
wounds
of
the
war
to
forget
past
differences
and
to
forgive
as
far
as
possible
the
faults
to
which
the
war
gave
rise
in
no
other
way
can
the
union
be
truly
and
permanently
restored
we
are
now
together
as
a
band
of
brothers
the
soldiers
of
the
confederacy
headed
by
the
great
chief
we
now
mourn
have
expressed
their
willingness
to
abide
by
the
issue
of
the
contest
what
a
spectacle
to
the
world
after
years
of
military
devastation
with
tens
of
thousands
dead
on
her
with
the
flower
of
her
children
slain
with
her
wealth
destroyed
her
commerce
swept
away
her
agricultural
and
mechanical
pursuits
almost
ruined
the
south
yielded
the
north
victorious
and
strong
could
not
forget
what
she
owed
to
liberty
and
human
rights
we
may
well
swear
now
that
as
long
as
liberty
is
virtuous
we
will
be
brothers
robert
lee
is
worthy
of
all
praise
as
a
man
he
was
peerless
as
a
soldier
he
had
no
equal
and
no
superior
as
a
humane
and
christian
soldier
he
towers
high
in
the
political
horizon
you
can
not
imagine
with
what
delight
when
i
had
the
honor
to
represent
this
country
at
the
court
of
great
britain
i
heard
the
praises
of
his
fame
and
character
which
came
from
soldiers
and
statesmen
i
need
not
speak
of
the
comparative
merits
of
general
lee
and
the
union
generals
who
opposed
him
this
is
not
the
place
or
time
for
a
discussion
of
their
respective
successes
and
defeats
but
i
may
say
that
as
far
as
i
was
able
to
judge
of
the
sentiments
of
the
military
men
of
great
britain
they
thought
none
of
the
union
officers
superior
to
general
robert
lee
their
admiration
for
him
was
not
only
on
account
of
his
skill
on
the
and
the
skilful
manner
with
which
he
planned
and
executed
his
campaigns
but
the
humane
manner
in
which
he
performed
his
sad
duty
they
alluded
specially
to
his
conduct
when
invading
the
territory
of
his
enemy
his
restraint
upon
his
men
telling
them
that
the
honor
of
the
army
depended
upon
the
manner
of
conducting
the
war
in
the
enemy
country
and
his
refusal
to
resort
to
retaliatory
measures
i
know
that
great
influences
were
brought
to
bear
upon
him
when
he
invaded
pennsylvania
to
induce
him
to
consent
to
extreme
measures
his
answer
however
was
if
i
suffer
my
army
to
pursue
the
course
recommended
i
can
not
invoke
the
blessing
of
god
upon
my
arms
he
would
not
allow
his
troops
to
destroy
private
property
or
to
violate
the
rights
of
the
citizens
when
the
necessities
of
his
army
compelled
the
taking
of
commissary
stores
by
his
orders
his
officers
paid
for
them
in
confederate
money
at
its
then
valuation
no
burning
homesteads
illumined
his
march
no
shivering
and
helpless
children
were
turned
out
of
their
homes
to
witness
their
destruction
by
the
torch
with
him
all
the
rules
of
civilized
war
having
the
higher
sanction
of
god
were
strictly
observed
the
manly
fortitude
with
which
he
yielded
at
appomattox
to
three
times
his
numbers
showed
that
he
was
worthy
of
the
honors
and
the
fame
the
south
had
given
him
this
is
not
the
first
time
since
the
termination
of
the
war
i
have
expressed
admiration
and
friendship
for
robert
lee
when
i
heard
that
he
was
about
to
be
prosecuted
in
a
virginia
court
for
the
alleged
crime
of
treason
i
wrote
to
him
at
once
and
with
all
my
heart
that
if
he
believed
i
could
be
of
any
service
to
him
professionally
i
was
at
his
command
all
the
ability
i
possess
increased
by
more
than
fifty
years
of
study
and
experience
would
have
been
cheerfully
exerted
to
have
saved
him
for
in
saving
him
i
believe
i
would
have
been
saving
the
honor
of
my
country
i
received
a
characteristic
reply
in
terms
of
friendship
and
grateful
thanks
he
wrote
that
he
did
not
think
the
prosecution
would
take
place
hearing
however
some
time
after
that
the
prosecution
would
commence
at
richmond
i
went
at
once
to
that
city
and
saw
his
legal
adviser
hon
william
mcfarland
one
of
the
ablest
men
of
the
bar
of
virginia
mcfarland
showed
me
a
copy
of
a
letter
from
general
lee
to
general
grant
enclosing
an
application
for
a
pardon
which
he
desired
general
grant
to
present
to
the
president
but
telling
him
not
to
present
it
if
any
steps
had
been
taken
for
his
prosecution
as
he
was
willing
to
stand
the
test
he
wrote
that
he
had
understood
by
the
terms
of
surrender
at
appomattox
that
he
and
all
his
officers
and
men
were
to
be
protected
that
letter
i
am
glad
to
say
raised
general
lee
higher
in
my
esteem
general
grant
at
once
replied
and
he
showed
his
reply
to
me
he
wrote
that
he
had
seen
the
president
and
protested
against
any
steps
being
taken
against
general
lee
and
had
informed
him
that
he
considered
his
honor
and
the
honor
of
the
nation
pledged
to
him
the
president
became
satisfied
and
no
proceedings
were
ever
taken
general
grant
transmitted
to
the
president
the
application
of
general
lee
for
pardon
indorsed
with
his
most
earnest
approval
no
pardon
was
granted
he
did
not
need
it
here
and
when
he
appears
before
that
great
tribunal
before
which
we
must
all
be
called
he
will
find
he
has
no
account
to
settle
there
no
soldier
who
followed
general
lee
could
have
felt
more
grief
and
sympathy
at
his
grave
than
i
would
could
i
have
been
present
upon
the
mournful
occasion
of
his
burial
i
lamented
his
loss
as
a
private
loss
and
still
more
as
a
public
loss
i
knew
that
his
example
would
continue
to
allay
the
passions
aroused
by
the
war
and
which
i
was
not
surprised
were
excited
by
some
acts
in
that
war
i
love
my
country
i
am
jealous
of
her
honor
i
cherish
her
good
name
and
i
am
proud
of
the
land
of
my
birth
i
forbear
to
criticise
the
lives
and
characters
of
her
high
officers
and
servants
but
i
can
say
with
truth
that
during
the
late
war
the
laws
of
humanity
were
forgotten
and
the
higher
orders
of
god
were
trodden
under
foot
the
resolutions
need
no
support
which
human
lips
can
by
human
language
give
their
subject
is
their
support
the
name
of
lee
appeals
at
once
and
strongly
to
every
true
heart
in
this
land
and
throughout
the
world
let
political
partisans
influenced
by
fanaticism
and
the
hope
of
political
plunder
find
fault
with
and
condemn
us
they
will
be
forgotten
when
the
name
of
lee
will
be
resplendent
with
immortal
glory
chairman
and
gentlemen
in
the
course
of
nature
my
career
upon
earth
must
soon
terminate
god
grant
that
when
the
day
of
my
death
comes
i
may
look
up
to
heaven
with
that
confidence
and
faith
which
the
life
and
character
of
robert
lee
gave
him
he
died
trusting
in
god
as
a
good
man
with
a
good
life
and
a
pure
conscience
he
was
consoled
with
the
knowledge
that
the
religion
of
christ
had
ordered
all
his
ways
and
he
knew
that
the
verdict
of
god
upon
the
account
he
would
have
to
render
in
heaven
would
be
one
of
judgment
seasoned
with
mercy
he
had
a
right
to
believe
that
when
god
passed
judgment
upon
the
account
of
his
life
though
he
would
find
him
an
erring
human
being
he
would
find
virtue
enough
and
religious
faith
enough
to
save
him
from
any
other
verdict
than
that
of
done
good
and
faithful
servant
the
monument
will
be
raised
and
when
it
is
raised
many
a
man
will
visit
richmond
to
stand
beside
it
to
do
reverence
to
the
remains
it
may
cover
and
to
say
lie
the
remains
of
one
of
the
noblest
men
who
ever
lived
or
died
in
america
hon
george
william
brown
chairman
and
the
able
and
eloquent
gentlemen
who
have
preceded
me
have
left
but
little
for
me
to
say
i
rise
however
to
express
my
hearty
assent
to
the
resolutions
their
broad
and
liberal
views
are
worthy
of
the
great
and
good
man
whose
virtues
and
fame
we
seek
to
commemorate
he
has
passed
away
from
earth
and
our
blame
or
censure
is
nothing
to
him
now
the
most
eloquent
eulogies
that
human
lips
can
utter
and
the
loftiest
monuments
that
human
hands
can
build
can
not
affect
him
now
but
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
us
to
know
that
expressions
of
the
love
for
him
which
lives
in
every
southern
heart
ay
in
many
a
northern
heart
were
heard
long
before
his
death
and
that
honor
shed
noble
lustre
around
the
last
years
of
his
life
he
was
the
representative
of
a
lost
cause
he
had
sheathed
his
sword
forever
he
had
surrendered
his
army
to
superior
numbers
he
was
broken
in
fortune
and
in
health
and
was
only
president
of
a
virginia
college
yet
he
was
one
of
the
foremost
men
of
all
the
world
it
has
been
said
of
general
lee
as
it
has
been
said
of
washington
that
he
was
deficient
in
genius
his
character
was
so
complete
that
what
would
have
seemed
evidences
of
genius
with
other
men
were
lost
in
the
combination
of
his
character
and
mind
he
was
always
and
especially
in
every
great
crisis
a
leader
among
men
during
the
four
years
of
his
education
at
west
point
he
did
not
receive
a
single
reprimand
as
a
wherever
he
went
he
was
a
marked
man
and
when
general
scott
made
his
wonderful
march
to
the
capital
of
mexico
captain
lee
was
his
right
arm
at
the
commencement
of
the
late
war
though
only
a
of
cavalry
he
was
offered
the
command
of
the
armies
of
the
united
states
what
a
prize
for
ambition
fortune
fame
and
honors
awaited
him
where
would
he
have
been
probably
in
the
presidential
chair
of
this
great
nation
but
he
rejected
all
to
take
his
chance
with
his
own
people
and
to
unite
with
them
in
their
resistance
to
the
vast
numbers
and
resources
which
he
knew
the
north
was
able
to
bring
against
them
there
is
nothing
more
remarkable
in
the
annals
of
warfare
than
the
success
with
which
general
lee
defeated
for
years
the
armies
of
the
united
states
consider
the
battles
around
richmond
the
second
battle
of
manassas
the
battles
at
antietam
fredericksburg
and
gettysburg
the
wonderful
contest
at
chancellorsville
then
again
the
remarkable
battle
of
the
wilderness
in
which
it
has
been
said
by
federal
authority
that
general
lee
actually
killed
as
many
men
as
he
had
under
his
command
the
defence
at
cold
harbor
the
prolonged
defence
of
richmond
and
petersburg
and
the
retreat
with
but
a
handful
before
an
immense
army
well
has
he
been
spoken
of
as
incomparable
strategist
did
any
man
ever
fight
against
more
desperate
odds
or
resources
but
not
merely
as
a
great
general
is
general
lee
to
be
admired
he
claims
our
admiration
as
a
great
man
great
in
adversity
i
think
there
is
nothing
more
admirable
in
all
his
life
than
his
conduct
in
assuming
the
sole
responsibility
at
gettysburg
in
the
midst
of
defeat
lee
was
calm
unmoved
showing
no
fear
where
despair
would
have
been
in
the
heart
of
any
other
general
and
saying
to
his
officers
and
men
fault
is
all
mine
let
the
monument
be
raised
not
merely
by
soldiers
of
general
lee
but
by
all
men
no
matter
of
what
political
feelings
who
appreciate
and
honor
that
which
is
manly
great
and
patriotic
the
monument
at
richmond
will
be
the
resort
of
pilgrims
from
the
north
as
well
as
from
the
south
and
the
grave
of
lee
will
be
second
only
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
to
the
grave
of
washington
lexington
at
the
meeting
at
lexington
resolutions
were
adopted
similar
to
those
already
given
the
meeting
was
addressed
by
general
preston
and
others
general
preston
i
am
permitted
to
accompany
the
report
with
a
few
remarks
although
i
deem
it
unnecessary
to
use
one
word
of
commendation
on
the
character
of
such
a
man
these
resolutions
are
no
doubt
very
short
but
they
will
testify
the
feelings
of
every
man
no
matter
what
may
have
been
his
opinions
as
to
the
past
every
true
and
generous
soul
feels
that
these
resolutions
are
expressive
of
the
sorrow
entertained
by
the
whole
country
we
speak
not
only
the
common
voice
of
america
but
of
the
world
at
this
hour
it
is
no
ordinary
case
of
eulogy
over
an
ordinary
being
but
over
one
who
was
the
man
of
the
century
a
man
who
by
mighty
armies
commanded
with
admirable
skill
by
great
victories
achieved
and
yet
never
stained
by
exultation
by
mighty
misfortunes
met
with
a
calm
eye
and
submitted
to
with
all
the
dignity
that
belongs
to
elevated
intelligence
and
by
his
simplicity
and
grandeur
challenged
the
admiration
of
civilized
mankind
and
still
more
remarkable
after
yielding
to
the
greatest
vicissitudes
that
the
world
ever
saw
resigned
himself
to
the
improvement
of
the
youth
of
the
country
to
the
last
moment
of
his
mortal
life
looking
to
the
glorious
life
which
he
contemplated
beyond
the
tomb
i
must
confess
that
notwithstanding
the
splendor
and
glory
of
his
career
i
envy
him
the
dignity
of
the
pacific
close
of
his
life
nothing
more
gentle
nothing
more
great
nothing
more
uncomplaining
has
ever
been
recorded
in
the
history
of
the
world
by
returning
to
napoleon
we
find
he
murmured
we
find
all
the
marks
of
mortality
and
mortal
anger
but
in
lee
we
find
a
man
perfect
in
christian
principles
dignified
yet
simple
i
knew
him
first
when
he
was
a
captain
i
was
then
a
young
man
connected
with
one
of
the
regiments
of
this
state
in
mexico
the
fourth
kentucky
and
when
i
first
saw
him
he
was
a
man
of
extreme
physical
beauty
remarkable
for
his
great
gentleness
of
manner
and
for
his
freedom
from
all
military
and
social
vices
at
that
time
general
scott
by
common
consent
had
fixed
upon
general
lee
as
the
man
who
would
make
his
mark
if
ever
the
country
needed
his
services
he
never
swore
an
oath
he
never
drank
he
never
wrangled
but
there
was
not
a
single
dispute
between
gentlemen
that
his
voice
was
not
more
potent
than
any
other
his
rare
calmness
serenity
and
dignity
were
above
all
when
the
war
came
on
he
followed
his
native
state
virginia
for
he
was
the
true
representative
of
the
great
virginia
family
at
washington
he
was
the
real
type
of
his
race
he
was
possessed
of
all
the
most
perfect
points
of
washington
character
with
all
the
noble
traits
of
his
own
scott
maintained
that
lee
was
the
greatest
soldier
in
the
army
his
discerning
eye
compared
men
and
i
remember
when
in
some
respects
i
thought
general
lee
military
education
had
not
fitted
him
for
the
great
talents
which
he
was
destined
to
display
i
remember
when
general
scott
made
use
of
these
remarkable
words
tell
you
one
thing
if
i
was
on
my
and
knew
there
was
a
battle
to
be
fought
for
the
liberties
of
my
country
and
the
president
was
to
say
to
me
scott
who
shall
command
i
tell
you
that
with
my
dying
breath
i
should
say
robert
lee
nobody
but
robert
lee
robert
lee
and
nobody
but
lee
that
impressed
me
very
much
because
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
lee
was
not
prosperous
and
why
because
he
was
building
up
his
men
with
that
science
which
he
possessed
his
great
qualities
were
discerned
not
after
his
remarkable
campaigns
but
long
before
it
his
name
was
regarded
with
that
respected
preëminence
to
which
it
did
rise
under
that
campaign
and
i
now
say
and
even
opposite
officers
will
admit
that
no
man
has
displayed
greater
power
more
military
ability
or
more
noble
traits
of
character
than
robert
lee
therefore
it
is
that
america
has
lost
much
europe
will
testify
this
as
well
as
ourselves
in
this
local
community
europe
will
weigh
this
but
will
weigh
him
with
moltke
and
bazaine
with
the
duke
of
magenta
and
with
all
military
men
and
in
my
judgment
those
ages
will
say
that
the
greatest
fame
and
ability
belonged
to
robert
lee
but
let
us
look
to
his
moral
character
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
through
his
whole
life
he
had
been
a
fervent
and
simple
christian
throughout
his
campaigns
he
was
a
brave
and
splendid
soldier
if
you
ask
of
his
friends
you
will
find
that
they
adore
him
if
you
ask
his
character
from
his
enemies
you
will
find
that
they
respect
him
and
respect
is
the
involuntary
tribute
which
friend
and
enemy
alike
have
to
pay
to
elevated
worth
and
as
the
bells
toll
their
sounds
will
vibrate
with
the
tenderest
feelings
through
every
noble
heart
public
confessions
of
his
worth
and
his
greatness
will
be
made
through
thousands
of
the
towns
and
cities
throughout
this
broad
land
and
even
where
they
are
silent
monitors
within
will
tell
that
a
great
spirit
hath
fled
this
secret
monitor
will
tell
that
a
great
and
good
man
has
passed
away
who
has
left
in
my
opinion
no
equal
behind
him
rev
henderson
since
the
announcement
of
the
death
of
robert
lee
i
have
been
momentarily
expecting
the
appearance
of
a
call
to
pay
some
tribute
to
his
splendid
memory
but
if
a
notice
had
been
given
of
this
meeting
it
altogether
escaped
my
attention
else
i
would
have
been
here
freely
and
voluntarily
if
i
am
a
stranger
in
lexington
and
my
lot
has
been
cast
here
only
during
the
last
three
weeks
yet
i
am
happy
that
my
here
have
paid
me
such
great
respect
as
to
call
on
me
on
such
an
occasion
as
the
present
to
testify
to
the
greatness
and
glory
of
general
robert
lee
some
public
calamity
is
required
to
bring
us
into
one
great
brotherhood
touch
of
nature
makes
the
whole
world
kin
though
you
are
all
strangers
to
me
yet
in
that
common
sympathy
which
we
all
feel
we
are
mourners
together
at
the
bier
of
departed
worth
it
does
not
become
one
of
my
profession
to
take
any
partisan
view
of
the
life
of
such
a
man
although
it
was
my
fortune
to
follow
the
same
flag
which
he
carried
to
victory
upon
so
many
fields
when
it
was
furled
it
was
done
with
such
calm
magnificence
as
to
win
the
admiration
of
his
enemies
and
of
the
world
yet
i
do
not
stand
here
to
make
any
reference
to
that
cause
which
has
passed
from
the
theatre
of
earth
activity
and
taken
its
place
only
in
history
but
i
do
claim
the
right
from
the
which
i
occupy
of
pointing
to
a
man
worthy
of
the
emulation
of
all
who
love
the
true
nobility
of
humanity
a
man
who
was
magnanimous
to
his
enemies
who
would
weep
at
the
calamities
of
his
foes
who
throughout
the
sanguinary
struggle
could
preserve
in
himself
the
fullest
share
of
human
sympathy
history
will
challenge
the
world
to
produce
a
single
instance
in
which
this
great
man
ever
wantonly
inflicted
a
blow
or
ever
wilfully
imposed
punishment
upon
any
of
his
captives
or
ever
pushed
his
victory
upon
an
enemy
to
gain
unnecessary
results
a
man
who
in
all
his
campaigns
showed
the
same
bright
example
to
all
the
battalions
that
followed
the
lead
of
his
sword
and
now
since
that
flag
which
he
carried
has
been
furled
what
a
magnificent
example
has
been
presented
to
the
world
it
was
said
of
washington
that
he
was
first
in
war
and
first
in
peace
but
in
the
latter
regard
robert
lee
showed
more
greatness
than
even
the
father
of
his
country
he
was
struck
down
the
sun
that
had
brightened
up
the
horizon
of
hopes
sank
in
dark
eclipse
to
set
in
the
shadow
of
disappointment
calm
and
magnificent
in
the
repose
of
conscious
strength
he
felt
that
he
had
lived
and
struggled
for
a
principle
that
was
dear
to
him
though
dead
it
only
remained
for
him
to
be
our
example
to
the
stricken
and
suffering
people
for
whom
he
labored
and
to
show
how
magnanimously
a
brave
and
true
christian
could
act
even
when
all
he
held
sacred
and
dear
was
shattered
by
the
hand
of
calamity
and
at
the
close
of
his
career
he
devoted
his
splendid
capacity
to
the
culture
of
the
minds
of
his
youth
he
came
down
from
the
summit
on
which
he
had
won
the
admiration
to
the
steady
regular
duties
of
the
to
take
his
place
in
the
vestry
of
a
christian
church
and
to
administer
the
affairs
of
a
country
parish
in
the
interest
of
christianity
a
man
who
by
his
dignity
and
simplicity
preserved
the
constant
admiration
of
his
enemies
without
even
giving
offence
to
his
friends
such
a
man
should
receive
a
niche
in
the
pantheon
of
fame
he
stood
in
that
great
struggle
of
which
as
a
star
he
was
the
leader
of
unclouded
brightness
drawing
over
its
mournful
history
a
splendor
which
is
reflected
from
every
sentence
of
its
chronicle
he
was
an
example
of
a
man
who
though
branded
because
of
defeat
still
by
his
exalted
character
gave
a
dignity
and
nobility
to
a
cause
which
doubtless
is
forever
dead
yet
still
is
rendered
immortal
by
the
achievements
of
robert
lee
sword
and
character
new
york
services
were
held
last
evening
says
a
journal
in
the
large
hall
of
the
cooper
institute
in
commemoration
of
the
life
and
character
of
the
late
general
robert
lee
of
the
confederate
states
army
with
especial
reference
to
his
civic
and
christian
virtues
the
call
for
the
meeting
stated
that
although
it
was
inaugurated
by
the
southern
residents
in
the
city
of
new
york
it
was
to
be
regarded
as
in
no
sense
born
of
partisan
feeling
but
solely
from
the
desire
to
do
honor
to
the
memory
of
a
great
and
good
man
an
illustrious
american
the
attendance
therefore
of
all
without
reference
to
section
or
nationality
was
cordially
invited
there
was
no
special
decoration
of
the
hall
grafulla
band
was
in
attendance
and
prior
to
the
opening
of
the
meeting
played
several
fine
dirges
the
choir
of
stephen
church
also
appeared
upon
the
platform
and
opened
the
proceedings
by
singing
holy
spirit
the
choir
consisted
of
madame
de
luzan
jennie
kempton
bauos
and
herr
weinlich
denforth
presided
at
the
piano
among
the
gentlemen
present
on

colonel

fielding
called
the
meeting
to
order
and
requested
the
rev
carter
to
offer
prayer
the
hon
john
ward
was
then
called
to
preside
and
delivered
the
following
address
all
the
marked
passages
of
which
were
loudly
applauded
we
meet
to
pay
a
tribute
of
respect
to
the
memory
of
one
whom
the
whole
south
revered
with
more
than
filial
affection
the
kind
manifestations
of
sympathy
expressed
through
the
press
of
this
great
metropolis
this
assemblage
the
presence
of
these
distinguished
men
who
join
with
us
this
evening
testify
that
the
afflicted
voice
of
his
bereaved
people
has
charmed
down
with
sweet
persuasion
the
angry
passions
kindled
by
the
conflict
in
which
he
was
their
chosen
leader
this
is
not
the
occasion
either
for
an
elaborate
review
of
his
life
or
a
eulogy
of
his
character
i
propose
to
attempt
neither
born
of
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
distinguished
families
of
our
country
one
so
renowned
in
the
field
and
in
the
cabinet
that
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
give
brighter
lustre
to
it
general
robert
lee
rendered
that
family
name
even
more
illustrious
and
by
his
genius
and
virtues
extended
its
fame
to
regions
of
the
globe
where
it
had
never
before
been
mentioned
there
is
no
cause
for
envy
or
hatred
left
now
his
soldiers
adored
him
most
not
in
the
glare
of
his
brilliant
victories
but
in
the
hour
of
his
deepest
humiliation
when
his
last
great
battle
had
been
fought
and
lost
when
the
government
for
which
he
had
struggled
was
crumbling
about
him
when
his
staff
asking
in
despair
can
now
be
done
he
gave
that
memorable
reply
were
strange
indeed
if
human
virtue
were
not
at
least
as
strong
as
human
calamity
this
is
the
key
to
his
life
the
belief
that
trials
and
strength
suffering
and
consolation
come
alike
from
god
obedience
to
duty
was
ever
his
ruling
principle
infallibility
is
not
claimed
for
him
in
the
exercise
of
his
judgment
in
deciding
what
duty
was
but
what
he
believed
duty
to
command
that
he
performed
without
thought
of
how
he
would
appear
in
the
performance
in
the
judgment
of
many
he
may
have
mistaken
his
duty
when
he
decided
that
it
did
not
require
him
to
draw
his
sword
his
home
his
kindred
and
his
children
but
lee
was
no
casuist
or
politician
he
was
a
soldier
that
he
would
do
highly
that
would
he
do
holily
he
taught
the
world
that
the
christian
and
the
gentleman
could
be
united
in
the
warrior
it
was
not
when
in
pomp
and
power
when
he
commanded
successful
legions
and
led
armies
to
victories
but
when
in
sorrow
and
privation
he
assumed
the
instruction
and
guidance
of
the
youth
of
virginia
laying
the
only
true
foundation
upon
which
a
republic
can
rest
the
christian
education
of
its
youth
that
he
reaped
the
rich
harvest
of
a
people
love
goodness
was
the
chief
attribute
of
greatness
uniting
in
himself
the
rigid
piety
of
the
puritan
with
the
genial
generous
impulses
of
the
cavalier
he
won
the
love
of
all
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
from
the
thoughtless
child
with
whom
it
was
ever
his
delight
to
sport
to
the
great
captain
of
the
age
with
whom
he
fought
all
the
battles
of
mexico
some
may
believe
that
the
world
has
given
birth
to
warriors
more
renowned
to
rulers
more
skilled
in
statecraft
but
all
must
concede
that
a
purer
nobler
man
never
lived
what
successful
warrior
or
ruler
in
ancient
or
modern
times
has
descended
to
his
grave
amid
such
universal
grief
and
lamentation
as
our
lee
caesar
fell
by
the
hands
of
his
own
beloved
brutus
because
by
his
tyranny
he
would
have
enslaved
rome
frederick
the
great
the
founder
of
an
empire
became
so
hated
of
men
and
learned
so
to
despise
them
that
he
ordered
his
carcass
as
he
called
it
to
be
buried
with
his
favorite
dogs
at
potsdam
napoleon
reached
his
giddy
height
by
paths
which
lee
would
have
scorned
to
tread
only
to
be
hurled
from
his
eminence
by
all
the
powers
of
europe
which
his
insatiate
ambition
had
combined
against
him
wellington
the
conqueror
of
napoleon
became
the
leader
of
a
political
party
and
lived
to
need
the
protection
of
police
from
a
mob
even
our
own
washington
whose
character
was
as
high
above
that
of
the
mere
warrior
and
conqueror
as
is
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
above
us
to
the
low
earth
we
tread
beneath
our
feet
was
libelled
in
life
and
slandered
in
death
such
were
the
fates
of
the
most
successful
captains
and
warriors
of
the
world
for
four
long
years
lee
occupied
a
position
not
less
prominent
than
that
of
the
most
distinguished
among
them
the
eyes
of
the
civilized
world
watched
his
every
movement
and
scanned
his
every
motive
his
cause
was
lost
he
was
unsuccessful
yet
he
lived
to
illustrate
to
the
world
how
despite
failure
and
defeat
a
soldier
could
command
honor
and
love
from
those
for
whom
he
struggled
and
admiration
and
respect
from
his
foes
such
as
no
success
had
ever
before
won
for
warrior
prince
or
potentate
and
when
his
life
was
ended
the
whole
population
of
the
south
forming
one
mighty
funeral
procession
followed
him
to
his
grave
his
obsequies
modestly
performed
by
those
most
tenderly
allied
to
him
he
sleeps
in
the
bosom
of
the
land
he
loved
so
well
his
spotless
fame
will
gather
new
vigor
and
freshness
from
the
lapse
of
time
and
the
day
is
not
distant
when
that
fame
will
be
claimed
not
as
the
property
of
a
section
but
as
the
heritage
of
a
united
people
his
soul
now
forever
freed
from
earth

general

rose
and
said
it
is
with
emotions
of
infinite
grief
i
rise
to
perform
one
of
the
saddest
duties
of
my
life
the
committee
who
have
arranged
the
ceremonies
on
this
occasion
deemed
it
expedient
and
proper
to
select
a
virginian
as
their
organ
to
present
to
this
large
assembly
of
the
people
of
new
york
a
formal
preamble
and
resolutions
which
give
expression
to
their
feelings
in
regard
to
the
death
of
general
robert
lee
this
distinction
has
been
conferred
by
the
committee
upon
me
and
i
shall
proceed
to
read
their
report
without
offering
to
submit
any
remarks
as
to
the
feelings
excited
in
my
own
heart
by
this
mournful
intelligence
resolutions
in
this
great
metropolitan
city
of
america
where
men
of
every
clime
and
of
all
nationalities
mingle
in
the
daily
intercourse
of
pleasure
and
of
business
no
great
public
calamity
can
befall
any
people
in
the
world
without
touching
a
sympathetic
chord
in
the
hearts
of
thousands
when
therefore
tidings
reached
us
that
general
robert
lee
of
virginia
was
dead
and
that
the
people
of
that
and
all
the
other
southern
states
of
the
union
were
stricken
with
grief
the
great
public
heart
of
new
york
was
moved
with
a
generous
sympathy
which
found
kindly
and
spontaneous
expression
through
the
columns
of
the
city
press
of
every
shade
of
opinion
all
differences
of
the
past
all
bitter
memories
all
the
feuds
that
have
kept
two
great
sections
of
our
country
in
angry
strife
and
controversy
for
so
long
have
been
forgotten
in
the
presence
of
the
fact
that
no
virtues
no
deeds
no
honors
nor
any
position
can
save
any
member
of
the
human
family
from
the
common
lot
of
all
the
universal
and
profound
grief
of
our
southern
countrymen
is
natural
and
honorable
alike
to
themselves
and
to
him
whom
they
mourn
and
is
respected
throughout
the
world
for
robert
lee
was
allied
and
endeared
to
them
by
all
the
most
sacred
ties
that
can
unite
an
individual
to
a
community
he
was
born
and
reared
in
their
midst
and
shared
their
local
peculiarities
opinions
and
traditional
characteristics
and
his
preëminent
abilities
and
exalted
personal
integrity
and
christian
character
made
him
by
common
consent
their
leader
and
representative
in
a
great
national
conflict
in
which
they
had
staked
life
fortune
and
honor
and
in
virginia
his
family
was
coeval
with
the
existence
of
the
state
and
its
name
was
emblazoned
upon
those
bright
pages
of
her
early
civil
and
military
annals
which
record
the
patriotic
deeds
of
washington
and
his
compeers
by
no
act
of
his
did
he
ever
forfeit
or
impair
the
confidence
thus
reposed
in
him
by
his
own
peculiar
people
and
when
he
had
through
years
of
heroic
trial
and
suffering
done
all
that
mortal
man
could
do
in
discharge
of
the
high
trust
confided
by
them
to
his
hands
and
failed
he
bowed
with
dignified
submission
to
the
decree
of
providence
and
from
the
day
he
gave
his
parole
at
appomattox
to
the
hour
of
his
death
he
so
lived
and
acted
as
to
deprive
enmity
of
its
malignity
and
became
to
his
defeated
soldiers
and
countrymen
a
bright
example
of
unqualified
obedience
to
the
laws
of
the
land
and
of
support
to
its
established
government
nay
more
with
a
spirit
of
christian
and
affectionate
duty
to
his
impoverished
and
suffering
people
and
with
a
high
estimate
of
the
importance
of
mental
and
moral
culture
to
a
generation
of
youth
whose
earlier
years
were
attended
by
war
rough
teachings
he
went
from
the
tented
field
and
the
command
of
armies
to
the
quiet
shades
of
a
scholastic
institution
in
the
secluded
valleys
of
his
own
native
virginia
and
entered
with
all
the
earnestness
of
his
nature
upon
the
duties
of
instruction
and
there
spent
the
closing
years
of
his
life
in
training
the
minds
and
hearts
of
young
men
from
all
parts
of
the
country
for
the
highest
usefulness
their
day
and
generation
by
these
pursuits
and
his
exemplary
and
unobtrusive
life
since
the
close
of
the
great
war
in
america
he
won
the
respect
and
admiration
of
the
enlightened
and
the
good
of
the
whole
world
it
is
meet
and
natural
therefore
that
his
own
people
should
bewail
his
death
as
a
sore
personal
bereavement
to
each
one
of
them
those
of
us
here
assembled
who
were
his
soldiers
friends
and
supporters
sharing
all
the
trials
and
many
of
the
responsibilities
of
that
period
of
his
life
which
brought
him
so
prominently
before
the
world
honored
and
trusted
him
then
have
loved
and
admired
him
have
been
guided
by
his
example
since
and
now
that
he
is
dead
we
should
be
unworthy
of
ourselves
and
unworthy
to
be
called
his
countrymen
did
we
not
feel
and
express
the
same
poignant
grief
which
now
afflicts
those
among
whom
he
lived
and
died
those
of
us
who
were
not
his
soldiers
friends
and
supporters
when
war
raged
throughout
the
land
but
who
have
nevertheless
met
here
with
those
who
were
our
enemies
then
but
are
now
our
friends
and
countrymen
and
appreciate
with
them
the
character
of
lee
and
admire
his
rare
accomplishments
as
an
american
citizen
whose
fame
and
name
are
the
property
of
the
nation
we
all
unite
over
his
hallowed
sepulchre
in
an
earnest
prayer
that
old
divisions
may
be
composed
and
that
a
complete
and
perfect
reconciliation
of
all
estrangements
may
be
effected
at
the
tomb
where
all
alike
in
a
feeling
of
common
humanity
and

therefore
without

meeting
as

by

and
in
the

and
in
the
spirit
above
indicated
to
do
honor
to
a
great
man

who
has
gone
down
to
the
grave
we
do
that
we
have
received
with
feelings
of
profound
sorrow
intelligence
of
the
death
of
general
robert
lee
we
can
and
do
fully
appreciate
the
grief
of
our
southern
countrymen
at
the
death
of
one
so
honored
by
and
so
dear
to
them
and
we
tender
to
them
this
expression
of
our
sympathy
with
the
assurance
that
we
feel
in
the
contemplation
of
so
sad
an
event
that
we
are
and
ought
to
be
henceforth
and
forever
one
great
and
harmonious
national
family
sharing
on
all

each

joys
and

that
a
copy
of
the

preamble

these

signed

transmitted
to

with
a
request
that
the

the
resolutions
were
unanimously
adopted
by
a
standing
and
silent
vote
which
was
followed
by
a
spontaneous
outburst
of
hearty
applause
we
have
given
but
a
small
portion
of
the
addresses
which
were
called
forth
by
this
national
calamity
and
these
no
doubt
have
suffered
injustice
by
imperfect
reporting
but
we
have
shown
as
we
wished
to
show
the
standard
by
which
our
people
estimate
an
heroic
character
and
how
the
south
loves
and
honors
the
memory
of
her
great
leader
a
few
extracts
from
the
english
press
will
show
the
feeling
in
that
country
the
pall
mall
gazette
even
amid
the
turmoil
of
the
great
european
struggle
the
intelligence
from
america
announcing
that
general
robert
lee
is
dead
will
be
received
with
deep
sorrow
by
many
in
this
country
as
well
as
by
his
followers
and
in
america
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
robert
lee
ranked
among
the
great
men
of
the
present
time
he
was
the
able
soldier
of
the
southern
confederacy
the
bulwark
of
her
northern
frontier
the
obstacle
to
the
advance
of
the
federal
armies
and
the
leader
who
twice
threatened
by
the
capture
of
washington
to
turn
the
tide
of
success
and
to
accomplish
a
revolution
which
would
have
changed
the
destiny
of
the
united
states
six
years
passed
by
and
then
we
heard
that
he
was
dying
at
an
obscure
town
in
virginia
where
since
the
collapse
of
the
confederacy
he
had
been
acting
as
a
when
at
the
head
of
the
last
eight
thousand
of
his
valiant
army
the
remnants
which
battle
sickness
and
famine
had
left
him
he
delivered
up
his
sword
to
general
grant
at
appomattox
his
public
career
ended
he
passed
away
from
men
thoughts
and
few
in
europe
cared
to
inquire
the
fate
of
the
general
whose
exploits
had
aroused
the
wonder
of
neutrals
and
belligerents
and
whose
noble
character
had
excited
the
admiration
of
even
the
most
bitter
of
his
political
enemies
if
however
success
is
not
always
to
be
accounted
as
the
sole
foundation
of
renown
general
lee
life
and
career
deserve
to
be
held
in
reverence
by
all
who
admire
the
talents
of
a
general
and
the
noblest
qualities
of
a
soldier
his
family
were
well
known
in
virginia
descended
from
the
cavaliers
who
first
colonized
that
state
they
had
produced
more
than
one
man
who
fought
with
distinction
for
their
country
they
were
allied
by
marriage
to
washington
and
previous
to
the
recent
war
were
possessed
of
much
wealth
general
then
colonel
robert
lee
residing
when
not
employed
with
his
regiment
at
arlington
heights
one
of
the
most
beautiful
places
in
the
neighborhood
of
washington
when
the
civil
war
first
broke
out
he
was
a
colonel
in
the
united
states
army
who
had
served
with
distinction
in
mexico
and
was
accounted
among
the
best
of
the
american
officers
to
him
as
to
others
the
difficult
choice
presented
itself
whether
to
take
the
side
of
his
state
which
had
joined
in
the
secession
of
the
south
or
to
support
the
central
government
it
is
said
that
lee
debated
the
matter
with
general
scott
then
that
both
agreed
that
their
first
duty
lay
with
their
state
but
that
the
former
only
put
the
theory
into
practice
it
was
not
until
the
second
year
of
the
war
that
lee
came
prominently
forward
when
at
the
indecisive
battle
of
fair
oaks
in
front
of
richmond
general
johnston
having
been
wounded
he
took
command
of
the
army
and
subsequently
drove
mcclellan
with
great
loss
to
the
banks
of
the
james
river
from
that
time
he
became
the
recognized
leader
of
the
confederate
army
of
virginia
he
repulsed
wave
after
wave
of
invasion
army
after
army
being
hurled
against
him
only
to
be
thrown
back
beaten
and
in
disorder
the
government
at
washington
were
kept
in
constant
alarm
by
the
near
vicinity
of
his
troops
and
witnessed
more
than
once
the
entry
into
their
intrenchments
of
a
defeated
and
disorganized
rabble
which
a
few
days
previous
had
left
them
a
confident
host
twice
he
entered
the
northern
states
at
the
head
of
a
successful
army
and
twice
indecisive
battles
alone
preserved
from
destruction
the
federal
government
and
turned
the
fortune
of
the
war
he
impressed
his
character
on
those
who
acted
under
him
ambition
for
him
had
no
charms
duty
alone
was
his
guide
his
simplicity
of
life
checked
luxury
and
display
among
his
officers
while
his
disregard
of
hardships
silenced
the
murmurs
of
his
harassed
soldiery
by
the
troops
he
was
loved
as
a
father
as
well
as
admired
as
a
general
and
his
character
impressed
itself
on
all
who
were
brought
in
contact
with
him
and
made
itself
felt
through
the
ranks
of
the
virginian
army
it
is
said
that
during
four
years
of
war
he
never
slept
in
a
house
but
in
winter
and
summer
shared
the
hardships
of
his
soldiers
such
was
the
man
who
in
mature
age
at
a
period
of
life
when
few
generals
have
acquired
renown
fought
against
overwhelming
odds
for
the
cause
which
he
believed
just
he
saw
many
of
his
bravest
generals
and
dearest
friends
fall
around
him
but
although
constantly
exposed
to
fire
escaped
without
a
wound
the
battles
which
prolonged
and
finally
decided
the
issue
of
the
contest
are
now
little
more
than
names
antietam
fredericksburg
chancellorsville
and
gettysburg
are
forgotten
in
europe
by
all
excepting
those
who
study
recent
wars
as
lessons
for
the
future
and
would
collect
from
the
deeds
of
other
armies
experience
which
they
may
apply
to
their
own
to
them
the
boldness
of
lee
tactics
at
chancellorsville
will
ever
be
a
subject
of
admiration
while
even
those
who
least
sympathize
with
his
cause
will
feel
for
the
general
who
saw
the
repulse
of
longstreet
charge
at
gettysburg
and
beheld
the
failure
of
an
attempt
to
convert
a
defensive
war
into
one
of
attack
together
with
the
consequent
abandonment
of
the
bold
stroke
which
he
had
hoped
would
terminate
the
contest
quietly
he
rallied
the
broken
troops
taking
all
the
blame
on
himself
he
encouraged
the
officers
dispirited
by
the
reverse
and
in
person
formed
up
the
scattered
detachments
again
when
fortune
had
turned
against
the
confederacy
when
overwhelming
forces
from
all
sides
pressed
back
her
defenders
lee
for
a
year
held
his
ground
with
a
army
fighting
battle
after
battle
in
the
forests
and
swamps
around
richmond
no
reverses
seemed
to
dispirit
him
no
misfortune
appeared
to
ruffle
his
calm
brave
temperament
only
at
last
when
he
saw
the
remnants
of
his
noble
army
about
to
be
ridden
down
by
sheridan
cavalry
when
eight
thousand
men
and
broken
with
fatigue
were
surrounded
by
the
net
which
grant
and
sherman
had
spread
around
them
did
he
yield
his
fortitude
for
the
moment
gave
way
he
took
farewell
of
his
soldiers
and
giving
himself
up
as
a
prisoner
retired
a
ruined
man
into
private
life
gaining
his
bread
by
the
hard
and
uncongenial
work
of
governing
lexington
college
when
political
animosity
has
calmed
down
and
when
americans
can
look
back
on
those
years
of
war
with
feelings
unbiassed
by
party
strife
then
will
general
lee
character
be
appreciated
by
all
his
countrymen
as
it
now
is
by
a
part
and
his
name
will
be
honored
as
that
of
one
of
the
noblest
soldiers
who
have
ever
drawn
a
sword
in
a
cause
which
they
believed
just
and
at
the
sacrifice
of
all
personal
considerations
have
fought
manfully
a
losing
battle
the
saturday
review
this
journal
after
some
remarks
on
the
death
of
admiral
farragut
continues
a
still
more
famous
leader
in
the
war
has
lately
closed
a
blameless
life
there
may
be
a
difference
of
opinion
on
the
military
qualities
of
the
generals
who
fought
on
either
side
in
the
civil
war
but
it
is
no
disparagement
to
the
capacity
of
grant
or
of
sherman
to
say
that
they
had
no
opportunity
of
rivalling
the
achievements
of
general
lee
assuming
the
chief
command
in
the
confederate
army
in
the
second
campaign
of
the
war
he
repelled
three
or
four
invasions
of
virginia
winning
as
many
pitched
battles
over
an
enemy
of
enormously
superior
resources
after
driving
mcclellan
from
the
peninsula
he
inflicted
on
burnside
and
pope
defeats
which
would
have
been
ruinous
if
the
belligerents
had
been
on
equal
terms
but
twenty
millions
of
men
with
the
absolute
command
of
the
sea
and
the
rivers
eventually
overpowered
a
third
of
their
number
the
drawn
battle
of
gettysburg
proved
that
the
invasion
of
the
northern
states
was
a
blunder
and
in
it
became
evident
that
the
fall
of
the
confederacy
could
not
be
much
longer
delayed
nevertheless
general
lee
kept
grant
swarming
legions
at
bay
for
the
whole
summer
and
autumn
and
the
loss
of
the
northern
armies
in
the
final
campaign
exceeded
the
entire
strength
of
the
gallant
defenders
of
richmond
when
general
lee
outnumbered
cut
off
from
his
communications
and
almost
surrounded
by
his
enemies
surrendered
at
appomattox
he
might
console
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
had
only
failed
where
success
was
impossible
from
that
moment
he
used
his
unequalled
and
merited
authority
to
reconcile
the
southern
people
to
the
new
order
of
affairs
he
had
originally
dissented
from
the
policy
of
secession
and
he
followed
the
banner
of
his
state
exclusively
from
a
sense
of
duty
in
disregard
of
his
professional
and
private
interests
he
might
at
pleasure
have
been
of
the
northern
army
for
he
was
second
in
rank
to
general
scott
his
ancient
home
and
his
ample
estate
on
the
potomac
were
ravaged
by
the
enemy
but
he
never
expressed
a
regret
for
the
sacrifice
of
his
fortune
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
often
thwarted
by
political
superiors
and
by
incompetent
subordinates
but
his
equable
temper
and
lofty
nature
never
inclined
him
to
complaint
the
regret
for
his
loss
which
is
felt
throughout
the
vast
regions
of
the
south
is
a
just
tribute
to
one
of
the
greatest
and
purest
characters
in
american
history
it
will
not
be
inappropriate
to
reproduce
here
the
tribute
which
appeared
in
the
london
on
the
receipt
of
the
news
of
general
lee
illness
the
standard
the
announcement
that
general
lee
has
been
struck
down
by
paralysis
and
is
not
expected
to
recover
will
be
received
even
at
this
crisis
with
universal
interest
and
will
everywhere
excite
a
sympathy
and
regret
which
testify
to
the
deep
impression
made
on
the
world
at
large
by
his
character
and
achievements
few
are
the
generals
who
have
earned
since
history
began
a
greater
military
reputation
still
fewer
are
the
men
of
similar
eminence
civil
or
military
whose
personal
qualities
would
bear
comparison
with
his
the
bitterest
enemies
of
his
country
hardly
dared
to
whisper
a
word
against
the
character
of
her
most
distinguished
general
while
neutrals
regarded
him
with
an
admiration
for
his
deeds
and
a
respect
for
his
lofty
and
unselfish
nature
which
almost
grew
into
veneration
and
his
own
countrymen
learned
to
look
up
to
him
with
as
much
confidence
and
esteem
as
they
ever
felt
for
washington
and
with
an
affection
which
the
cold
demeanor
and
austere
temper
of
washington
could
never
inspire
the
death
of
such
a
man
even
at
a
moment
so
exciting
as
the
present
when
all
thoughts
are
absorbed
by
a
nearer
and
present
conflict
would
be
felt
as
a
misfortune
by
all
who
still
retain
any
recollection
of
the
interest
with
which
they
watched
the
virginian
campaigns
and
by
thousands
who
have
almost
forgotten
the
names
of
fredericksburg
and
chancellorsville
the
wilderness
and
spottsylvania
by
the
south
it
would
be
recognized
as
a
national
calamity
as
the
loss
of
a
man
not
only
inexpressibly
dear
to
an
unfortunate
people
by
his
intimate
association
with
their
fallen
hopes
and
their
proudest
recollections
but
still
able
to
render
services
such
as
no
other
man
could
perform
and
to
give
counsel
whose
value
is
enhanced
tenfold
by
the
source
from
which
it
comes
we
hope
even
yet
that
a
life
so
honorable
and
so
useful
so
pure
and
noble
in
itself
so
valuable
to
a
country
that
has
much
need
of
men
like
him
may
be
spared
and
prolonged
for
further
enjoyment
of
domestic
peace
and
comfort
for
further
service
to
his
country
we
can
not
bear
to
think
of
a
career
so
singularly
admirable
and
so
singularly
unfortunate
should
close
so
soon
and
so
sadly
by
the
tens
of
thousands
who
will
feel
as
we
do
when
they
read
the
news
that
now
lies
before
us
may
be
measured
the
impressions
made
upon
the
world
by
the
life
and
the
deeds
of
the
great
chief
of
the
army
of
virginia
whatever
differences
of
opinion
may
exist
as
to
the
merits
of
the
generals
against
whom
he
had
to
contend
and
especially
of
the
antagonist
by
whom
he
was
at
last
overcome
no
one
pretending
to
understand
in
the
least
either
the
general
principles
of
military
science
or
the
particular
conditions
of
the
american
war
doubts
that
general
lee
gave
higher
proofs
of
military
genius
and
soldiership
than
any
of
his
opponents
he
was
outnumbered
from
first
to
last
and
all
his
victories
were
gained
against
greatly
superior
forces
and
with
troops
greatly
deficient
in
every
necessary
of
war
except
courage
and
discipline
never
perhaps
was
so
much
achieved
against
odds
so
terrible
the
southern
soldiers
incomparable
southern
to
which
a
late
northern
writer
renders
due
tribute
of
respect
were
no
doubt
as
splendid
troops
as
a
general
could
desire
but
the
different
fortune
of
the
east
and
the
west
proves
that
the
virginian
army
owed
something
of
its
excellence
to
its
chief
always
outnumbered
always
opposed
to
a
foe
abundantly
supplied
with
food
transport
ammunition
clothing
all
that
was
wanting
to
his
own
men
he
was
always
able
to
make
courage
and
skill
supply
the
deficiency
of
strength
and
of
supplies
and
from
the
day
when
he
assumed
the
command
after
the
battle
of
seven
pines
where
general
joseph
johnston
was
disabled
to
the
morning
of
the
final
surrender
at
appomattox
he
was
almost
invariably
victorious
in
the
field
at
gettysburg
only
he
was
defeated
in
a
pitched
battle
on
the
offensive
at
the
chickahominy
at
centreville
and
at
chancellorsville
on
the
defensive
at
antietam
fredericksburg
the
wilderness
and
spottsylvania
he
was
still
successful
but
no
success
could
avail
him
any
thing
from
the
moment
that
general
grant
brought
to
bear
upon
the
virginian
army
the
inexhaustible
population
of
the
north
and
employing
sherman
to
cut
them
off
from
the
rest
of
the
confederacy
set
himself
to
work
to
wear
them
out
by
the
simple
process
of
exchanging
two
lives
for
one
from
that
moment
the
fate
of
richmond
and
of
the
south
was
sealed
when
general
lee
commenced
the
campaign
of
the
wilderness
he
had
we
believe
about
fifty
thousand
men
his
adversary
had
thrice
that
number
at
hand
and
a
still
larger
force
in
reserve
when
the
army
of
virginia
marched
out
of
richmond
it
still
numbered
some
thousand
men
after
a
retreat
of
six
days
in
the
face
of
an
overwhelming
enemy
with
a
crushing
artillery
a
retreat
impeded
by
constant
fighting
and
harassed
by
countless
hordes
of
cavalry
eight
thousand
were
given
up
by
the
capitulation
of
appomattox
brilliant
as
were
general
lee
earlier
triumphs
we
believe
that
he
gave
higher
proofs
of
genius
in
his
last
campaign
and
that
hardly
any
of
his
victories
were
so
honorable
to
himself
and
his
army
as
that
retreat
there
have
however
been
other
generals
of
genius
as
brilliant
of
courage
and
endurance
hardly
less
distinguished
how
many
men
have
ever
displayed
the
perfect
simplicity
of
nature
the
utter
absence
of
vanity
or
affectation
which
belongs
to
the
truest
and
purest
greatness
in
triumph
or
in
defeat
as
general
lee
has
done
when
of
the
southern
armies
he
moved
from
point
to
point
as
duty
required
with
less
parade
than
a
european
general
of
division
wearing
no
sword
attended
by
no
other
staff
than
the
immediate
occasion
demanded
and
chatting
with
a
comrade
or
a
visitor
with
a
simple
courtesy
which
had
in
it
no
shade
of
condescension
only
on
one
occasion
does
he
seem
to
have
been
accoutred
with
the
slightest
regard
to
military
display
or
personal
dignity
and
that
characteristically
was
the
last
occasion
on
which
he
wore
the
confederate
uniform
the
occasion
of
his
interview
with
general
grant
on
april
after
the
war
he
retired
without
a
word
into
privacy
and
obscurity
ruined
by
the
seizure
and
destruction
of
his
property
which
mcclellan
protected
and
which
his
successors
gave
up
to
ravage
and
pillage
the
late
of
the
southern
armies
accepted
the
presidency
of
a
virginia
college
and
devoted
himself
as
simply
and
earnestly
to
its
duties
as
if
he
had
never
filled
a
higher
station
or
performed
more
exciting
functions
well
aware
of
the
jealous
temper
of
the
party
dominant
in
the
north
and
anxious
above
all
things
to
avoid
exasperating
that
temper
against
his
conquered
countrymen
he
carefully
abstained
from
appearing
in
any
public
ceremony
or
taking
any
overt
part
in
political
questions
his
influence
has
been
exerted
quietly
but
steadily
in
one
direction
with
a
single
view
to
restore
harmony
and
between
the
two
sections
and
to
reconcile
the
oppressed
southerners
to
the
union
from
which
he
fought
so
gallantly
to
free
them
he
has
discountenanced
all
regretful
longings
after
the
lost
visions
of
southern
independence
all
demonstrations
in
honor
of
the
banner
and
has
encouraged
the
south
to
seek
the
restoration
of
her
material
prosperity
and
the
satisfaction
of
her
national
feelings
in
a
frank
acceptance
of
the
result
of
the
war
and
a
loyal
adhesion
to
the
federal
bond
it
was
characteristic
and
worthy
of
the
man
that
he
was
among
the
first
to
sue
for
a
formal
pardon
from
president
johnson
not
for
any
advantage
which
he
personally
could
obtain
thence
but
to
set
the
example
of
submission
to
his
and
to
reconcile
them
to
a
humiliation
without
which
the
conquerors
refused
them
that
restitution
to
civil
rights
necessary
to
any
effort
to
retrieve
their
own
or
their
country
fortunes
truer
greatness
a
loftier
nature
a
spirit
more
unselfish
a
character
purer
more
chivalrous
the
world
has
rarely
if
ever
known
of
stainless
life
and
deep
religious
feeling
yet
free
from
all
taint
of
cant
and
fanaticism
and
as
dear
and
congenial
to
the
cavalier
stuart
as
to
the
puritan
stonewall
jackson
unambitious
but
ready
to
sacrifice
all
at
the
call
of
duty
devoted
to
his
cause
yet
never
moved
by
his
feelings
beyond
the
line
prescribed
by
his
judgment
never
provoked
by
just
resentment
to
punish
wanton
cruelty
by
reprisals
which
would
have
given
a
character
of
needless
savagery
to
the
war
both
north
and
south
owe
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
to
him
and
the
time
will
come
when
both
will
be
equally
proud
of
him
and
well
they
may
for
his
character
and
his
life
afford
a
complete
answer
to
the
reproaches
commonly
cast
on
mechanical
america
a
country
which
has
given
birth
to
men
like
him
and
those
who
followed
him
may
look
the
chivalry
of
europe
in
the
face
without
shame
for
the
fatherlands
of
sidney
and
of
bayard
never
produced
a
nobler
soldier
gentleman
and
christian
than
general
robert
e
lee
we
may
add
to
these
the
following
just
remarks
upon
the
occupation
to
which
general
lee
devoted
himself
at
the
close
of
his
military
career
from
the
old
dominion
surely
it
should
be
a
cause
of
thankfulness
and
encouragement
for
those
who
are
teachers
that
their
profession
has
received
this
reflection
of
glory
and
honor
from
this
choice
of
his
from
this
life
and
from
this
death
and
it
is
enduring
honor
for
all
the
colleges
of
the
south
and
for
all
our
schools
an
honor
in
which
all
may
share
alike
without
jealousy
that
this
pure
and
bright
name
is
inseparably
connected
by
the
will
of
him
that
bore
it
with
the
cause
of
education
and
is
blended
now
with
that
of
washington
in
the
name
of
one
of
our
own
institutions
of
learning
we
think
that
so
long
as
the
name
of
lee
is
honored
and
loved
among
us
our
southern
teachers
may
rejoice
and
grow
stronger
in
their
work
when
they
remember
that
he
was
one
of
their
number
and
that
his
great
heart
that
had
so
bravely
borne
the
fortunes
of
a
great
empire
bore
also
amid
its
latest
aspirations
the
interests
the
anxieties
and
the
hopes
of
the
unpretending
but
noble
profession
of
teaching
to
leave
this
out
of
the
account
would
be
indeed
to
do
sad
injustice
to
general
lee
own
memory
and
that
not
only
because
his
position
in
this
profession
was
of
his
own
choice
and
was
steadily
maintained
with
unchanging
purpose
to
the
end
of
his
life
but
also
because
the
acknowledgment
of
his
service
here
is
necessary
to
the
completeness
of
his
fame
in
no
position
of
his
life
did
he
more
signally
develop
the
great
qualities
of
his
character
than
in
this
and
it
may
truly
be
said
that
some
of
the
greatest
can
only
be
fully
understood
in
the
light
of
the
serene
patience
and
of
the
simple
and
quiet
of
his
latest
years
it
was
then
that
far
from
the
tumult
of
arms
and
from
the
great
passions
of
public
life
with
no
great
ambition
to
nerve
his
heart
nor
any
great
events
to
obscure
the
public
criticism
of
his
conduct
he
displayed
in
calm
and
steady
light
the
grandest
features
of
his
character
and
by
this
crucial
test
added
certain
confirmation
to
the
highest
estimate
that
could
have
been
formed
of
his
character
and
of
his
abilities
it
was
indeed
a
test
for
such
a
man
and
that
he
sustained
it
as
he
did
is
not
among
the
smallest
of
his
claims
to
the
admiration
of
his
countrymen
no
tribute
to
his
memory
can
be
just
that
does
not
take
this
last
great
service
into
the
account
and
no
history
of
his
life
can
be
fairly
written
that
shall
not
place
in
the
strongest
light
his
career
and
influence
as
president
of
washington
college
and
we
may
appropriately
close
with
the
following
thoughtful
words
from
the
pen
of
hon
alexander
stephens
in
the
darkest
hour
of
our
trials
in
the
very
midst
of
our
deepest
affliction
mourning
over
the
loss
of
the
noble
lee
heaven
sends
to
us
as
consolation
the
best
sign
of
the
times
vouchsafed
in
many
a
day
it
addresses
the
heart
rent
as
it
is
in
surveying
the
desolations
around
us
as
the
rainbow
upon
the
breast
of
the
receding
when
its
power
and
fury
are
over
that
sign
is
the
unmistakable
estimation
in
which
the
real
merits
and
worth
of
this
illustrious
chieftain
of
the
cause
of
the
southern
states
is
held
by
all
classes
of
persons
not
only
in
the
south
but
in
the
north
partisans
and
leaders
aiming
at
the
overthrow
of
our
institutions
may
while
temporarily
in
high
places
by
fraud
and
usurpation
keep
up
the
false
cry
of
and
but
these
irrepressible
outburstings
of
popular
sentiment
regarding
no
restraints
on
which
cause
to
speak
show
clearly
how
this
cry
and
charge
are
regarded
and
looked
upon
by
the
masses
of
the
people
everywhere
everywhere
lee
is
honored
not
only
as
a
but
as
a
this
is
but
the
foreshadowing
of
the
general
judgment
of
the
people
of
the
whole
united
states
and
of
the
world
not
only
upon
lee
but
upon
all
of
his
associates
who
fought

and

in

glorious
cause
