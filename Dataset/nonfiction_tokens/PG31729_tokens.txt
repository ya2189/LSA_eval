the
apple
what
it
is
definition
fleshy
pome
or
fruit

a
rosaceous

origin
of
which
is
probably
the
wild
of
europe
cultivated
in
innumerable
varieties
in
the
temperate
is
scarcely
known
in
the
wild
state
but
as
an
escape
from
cultivation
its
fruit
becomes
small
acid
and
harsh
and
is
known
as
the
crab
the
cultivated

in
the
cultivation
of
the
apple
tree
which
like
most
plants
gets
its
nourishment
from
two
sources
the
soil
and
the
atmosphere
these
must
be
first
considered
from
the
soil
come
the
mineral
ingredients
those
that
are
given
back
to
the
soil
when
the
plant
is
burned
and
from
the
atmosphere
come
the
ingredients
of
no
less
importance
in
the
growth
of
the
tree
but
which
mostly
disappear
as
invisible
gases
upon
combustion
upon
the
character
of

soil
and
upon

climate
a
general
term
that
may
be
said
to
cover
the
conditions
of
the
atmosphere
depend
the
success
of
the
horticulturist
in
addition
to
this
insect
pests
are
liable
to
constantly
menace
the
crop
in
the
making
of
soils
a
process
that
is
constantly
going
on
the
most
important
agents
are
water
air
frost
sunshine
and
the
action
of
living
organisms
by
this
combined
action
the
mountain
with
its
rich
store
of
mineral
matter
is
disintegrated
its
constituents
are
partly
dissolved
in
the
water
and
partly
carried
mechanically
to
the
plains
below
the
air
is
distributed
through
the
soil
seeds
are
dropped
the
living
animal
forms
begin
to
multiply
the
soil
is
enriched
and
gradually
it
begins
to
be
in
a
condition
suitable
to
bear
the
simpler
forms
of
vegetable
life
which
in
turn
decaying
add
to
the
richness
of
the
soil
furthermore
the
mechanical
condition
of
the
soil
has
much
to
do
with
the
successful
growth
of
the
plant
if
the
soil
is
extremely
fine
it
is
liable
to
become
so
compact
that
the
rootlets
can
not
easily
penetrate
it
when
it
is
of
such
a
composition
as
to
bake
readily
in
the
sun
if
very
coarse
like
gravel
there
is
not
a
sufficient
capacity
to
retain
moisture
it
should
however
be
porous
enough
to
allow
the
air
to
penetrate
it
for
upon
the
aeration
of
the
soil
depends
much
of
its
fertility
we
loosen
the
soil
about
the
roots
of
plants
to
allow
the
air
to
penetrate
and
give
an
opportunity
for
the
chemical
changes
constantly
undergoing
in
the
soil
then
too
the
work
of
the
earthworms
in
loosening
the
soil
and
thus
adding
to
its
porosity
should
not
be
overlooked
in
this
soil
workshop
too
live
and
labor
certain
minute
organisms
that
make
it
their
business
to
enrich
the
soil
by
helping
the
rootlets
to
assimilate
the
nitrogen
of
the
air
since
the
soil
is
composed
mostly
of
ingredients
that
come
from
the
decomposition
of
rocks
it
follows
that
is
must
be
of
very
complex
composition
fortunately
however
there
are
only
a
few
of
the
ingredients
of
the
soil
that
are
of
interest
to
the
agriculturist
as
only
a
few
of
the
elements
as
they
are
called
go
to
make
up
the
plant
structure
or
at
least
only
a
few
are
essential
ingredients
of
the
plant
nitrogen
though
very
abundant
in
the
air
is
not
abundant
in
the
soil
in
fact
the
soil
has
to
depend
largely
on
the
nitrogen
compounds
that
are
washed
out
of
the
atmosphere
in
small
quantities
by
the
rain
another
source
of
nitrogen
is
the
action
of
certain
bacteria
that
make
little
sacs
on
the
rootlets
and
living
on
the
juices
of
the
plants
fix
the
nitrogen
of
the
air
and
thus
fertilize
the
soil
especially
on
plants
of
the
leguminous
family
as
peas
beans
and
clover
silicon
which
with
oxygen
makes
ordinary
sand
is
essential
to
the
growth
of
plants
and
is
everywhere
found
in
abundance
sulphur
united
with
oxygen
and
the
metals
to
form
sulphates
is
generally
abundant
enough
the
same
may
be
said
of
chlorine
which
united
with
sodium
or
potassium
is
always
present
in
our
prairie
soils
phosphorus
as
it
occurs
in
the
phosphates
is
one
of
the
most
essential
ingredients
of
a
fertile
soil
calcium
and
magnesium
are
found
in
combination
as
carbonates
and
sulphates
and
though
essential
are
usually
abundant
especially
where
limestone
rocks
underlie
the
soil
and
outcrop
in
so
many
places
potassium
is
found
united
with
chlorine
or
sulphuric
acid
it
is
one
of
the
elements
that
is
most
liable
to
be
exhausted
from
the
soil
by
a
succession
of
crops
sodium
exists
almost
everywhere
it
is
one
of
the
elements
of
common
salt
and
though
much
like
potassium
can
not
take
the
place
of
the
latter
in
plant
nurture
iron
is
abundant
and
at
the
same
time
necessary
in
small
quantities
the
elements
above
mentioned
together
with
oxygen
are
to
be
found
in
the
ashes
of
plants
besides
there
are
two
elements
that
come
largely
from
the
atmosphere
namely
carbon
and
hydrogen
which
united
with
oxygen
make
up
the
bulk
of
the
plant
thus
wood
is
a
substance
containing
carbon
hydrogen
and
oxygen
with
small
quantities
of
nitrogen
and
mineral
salts
the
mineral
salts
represent
about
one
per
cent
of
wood
having
considered
in
a
general
way
the
constituents
of
the
plant
and
having
noticed
the
source
of
each
of
these
constituents
it
may
be
of
interest
to
look
at
the
composition
of
the
soil
as
revealed
by
chemical
analysis
a
is
the
analysis
of
a
soil
from
finney
county
as
made
in
the
laboratory
of
the
kansas
state
university
by
the
author
b
is
a
soil
from
wyandotte
county
as
reported
in
the
report
of
the
kansas
state
board
of
agriculture
for

is
a
prairie

from

as
reported
by

of
the
department
of

silica
and
insoluble
iron
and
aluminum
oxides
calcium
oxide
magnesium

phosphoric
anhydride
chlorine
potassium

sodium
oxide
sulphuric
anhydride
volatile
and
organic
matter
moisture
undetermined
carbonic
acid
etc
in
some
cases
it
happens
that
there
is
a
sufficient
quantity
of
an
ingredient
in
the
soil
but
it
is
not
in
a
sufficiently
form
to
be
available
it
will
be
noticed
that
in
the
analyses
quoted
above
the
amount
of
the
necessary
constituents
of
the
soil
to
plant
growth
is
not
in
any
case
large
the
nitrogen
may
be
present
in
the
volatile
and
organic
matter
and
upon
the
proportion
of
this
complex
organic
matter
very
often
depends
to
a
great
extent
the
fertility
of
the
soil
some
experiments
made
at
one
of
the
agricultural
experiment
stations
upon
the
effect
of
apple
stock
that
is
young
trees
raised
for
nursery
purposes
on
the
soil
showed
that
in
eleven
tons
of
such
stock
the
following
quantities
of
ingredients
were
removed
from
the
soil
silica
lbs
phosphoric
acid
sulphuric
acid
chlorine
gas
iron
oxide
lime
lbs
magnesia
soda
potash
total
lbs
this
is
no
inconsiderable
quantity
of
material
to
be
removed
by
a
single
crop
professor
goessmann
in
discussing
the
ash
of
fruits
gives
the
following
analysis
of
the
ash
of
the
baldwin
apple
this
would
represent
the
mineral
matter
taken
from
the
soil
by
the
fruit
potash
per
cent
soda
lime
magnesia
and
phosphoric
acid
comparing
this
with
the
ash
of
other
fruits
it
is
seen
that
the
amount
of
potash
required
is
larger
than
in
the
case
of
other
fruits
except
plums
and
peaches
and
the
amount
of
phosphoric
acid
is
high
but
not
as
high
as
in
the
case
of
some
berries
the
application
is
obvious
in
order
to
successfully
raise
apples
there
must
be
an
abundance
of
potash
and
of
phosphoric
acid
in
the
soil
and
these
ingredients
must
be
in
an
available
form
if
we
compare
the
apple
and
the
pear
by
an
analysis
for
fertilizing
constituents
or
such
constituents
as
are
usually
introduced
into
deficient
soil
by
means
of
fertilizers
we
have
the
following
table
parts
of
the
fruit
contain
in
the
case
of
each
n
ash
cao
mgo
apple
pear
when
we
study
the
composition
of
the
apple
to
determine
the
proximate
principles
as
they
are
called
it
is
noticed
that
we
have
the
constituents
mentioned
in
the
discussion
of
the
elements
contained
in
the
fruit
combined
to
form
various
substances
thus
apples
pears
cherries
peaches
water
sugar
free
acid
albuminous
substances
pectous
substances
soluble
free
acid
in
fruits
is
not
neutralized
by
sugar
but
it
is
well
known
that
an
abundance
of
sugar
will
cover
up
the
sour
taste
of
a
fruit
the
constituents
above
noted
are
mostly
found
in
the
expressed
juice
of
the
fruit
and
give
it
its
characteristic
flavor
without
the
sugar
in
these
juices
it
would
not
be
possible
to
make
any
alcoholic
beverages
from
them
in
the
process
of
fermentation
in
the
case
of
apple
juice
we
have
first
the
change
of
the
sugar
to
alcohol
and
gas
which
imparts
to
cider
its
characteristic
taste
and
tang
afterwards
the
alcoholic
solution
in
the
presence
of
the
organic
matter
is
subjected
to
what
is
called
acetic
fermentation
that
is
the
vinegar
plant
grows
at
the
expense
of
the
organic
matter
in
the
cider
and
this
beverage
is
converted
into
vinegar
containing
acetic
acid
it
is
a
familiar
fact
that
the
change
does
not
readily
take
place
except
when
cider
is
exposed
to
the
air
and
this
is
shown
to
be
true
from
a
chemical
standpoint
as
the
cider
really
is
oxidized
to
make
the
vinegar
that
is
it
takes
up
oxygen
from
the
air
the
greater
the
proportion
of
sugar
the
greater
the
quantity
of
alcohol
the
stronger
the
vinegar
will
be
grapes
contain
more
than
twice
as
much
sugar
as
apples
hence
a
wine
that
is
made
from
them
is
stronger
in
alcohol
than
a
cider
made
from
apples
cherries
as
will
be
seen
by
reference
to
the
table
above
contain
a
large
amount
of
sugar
hence
their
use
in
making
cherry
brandy
which
contains
a
large
per
cent
of
alcohol
it
should
be
said
however
that
in
order
to
make
brandy
the
cherry
juice
must
be
distilled
in
this
respect
the
process
is
similar
to
that
employed
in
making
apple
brandy
after
the
juice
has
been
extracted
from
the
apples
the
pomace
that
remains
is
sometimes
used
as
a
fertilizer
this
is
valuable
chiefly
on
account
of
the
mineral
salts
contained
in
it
an
analysis
of
the
pomace
shows
that
it
contains
water
per
cent
ash
albuminous
substances
fiber
nitrogen
free
extract
fat
the
acid
of
the
apple
is
usually
considered
to
be
malic
acid
but
really
there
are
several
acids
mixed
together
it
is
a
mild
and
agreeable
vegetable
acid
and
its
presence
adds
much
to
the
flavor
of
the
fruit
the
pectous
and
albuminous
substances
are
those
that
assist
in
the
formation
of
fruit
jellies
some
of
these
substances
are
liquid
when
hot
and
gelatinize
on
cooling
by
too
long
boiling
they
lose
this
property
of
gelatinizing
hence
the
precaution
that
is
taken
in
the
making
of
fruit
jellies
not
to
boil
the
juice
too
long
the
subject
of
the
ripening
of
fruits
like
the
apple
has
been
extensively
studied
as
has
also
that
of
the
subsequent
decay
according
to
recent
researches
early
varieties
of
apples
contain
little
starch
when
picked
and
do
not
keep
well
the
season
soil
and
age
of
the
tree
affect
the
composition
of
the
fruit
it
has
been
shown
that
sugar
is
sure
to
be
formed
from
the
starch
in
the
process
of
ripening
after
the
fruit
is
taken
from
the
tree
and
during
the
winter
the
cane
sugar
is
gradually
and
finally
almost
entirely
changed
to
sugar
the
maximum
sugar
content
is
reached
earlier
the
earlier
in
the
season
the
apple
ripens
late
winter
varieties
reach
this
point
as
late
as
november
there
is
much
starch
in
the
latter
when
picked
which
gradually
changes
to
sugar
on
keeping
this
process
is
analogous
to
the
ripening
of
the
banana
this
fruit
is
picked
while
green
and
from
it
is
made
by
the
natives
of
south
america
a
flour
which
is
a
good
farinaceous
food
and
readily
answers
the
place
of
the
starchy
grains
we
are
familiar
with
the
fact
that
as
the
fruit
ripens
it
contains
large
quantities
of
sugar
and
is
edible
uncooked
which
fact
is
usually
not
true
of
starchy
foods
the
subject
of
the
decay
of
the
apple
has
been
discussed
in
a
very
interesting
way
in
the
science
for
may
by
byron
halsted
though
chemical
changes
take
place
here
also
and
the
apple
is
finally
resolved
mostly
into
gas
water
and
mineral
salts
yet
these
changes
are
brought
about
by
the
action
of
various
fungi
which
find
a
soil
favorable
to
their
growth
in
the
apple
pulp
though
apples
are
considered
digestible
and
wholesome
their
digestibility
is
much
increased
by
cooking
this
is
especially
true
if
some
of
the
starch
is
not
converted
to
sugar
for
as
noted
above
starch
to
be
readily
assimilated
in
the
system
should
be
cooked
there
is
probably
no
fruit
that
is
so
uniformly
wholesome
and
so
deservedly
popular
with
all
classes
as
the
apple
the
apple
and
pear
were
known
in
england
before
the
conquest
and
indeed
probably
before
the
saxon
invasion
they
have
been
gradually
improved
from
the
wild
of
europe
it
is
stated
on
good
authority
that
there
is
no
country
on
the
globe
so
well
adapted
to
the
growth
of
this
fruit
as
the
temperate
regions
of
north
america
and
this
seems
to
be
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
the
apples
of
the
united
states
are
superseding
the
native
fruit
in
most
of
the
civilized
countries

i
shall
speak
of
our
foreign

a
kansas
apple
in
london
is
a
long
way
from
home
but
it
is
there
and
not
at
all
disconcerted
by
its
strange
surroundings
what
is
our
apple
doing
there
was
it
imported
as
a
curiosity
is
it
there
as
evidence
of
some
venture
or
speculation
neither
it
has
passed
the
experimental
stage
and
is
on
a
perfectly
legitimate
errand
it
has
gone
over
for
english
gold
and
will
send
the
same
back
to
its
kansas
home
now
comes
the
interesting
part
which
makes
business
of
the
transaction
if
profitable
it
means
prosperity
and
a
wave
of
prosperity
is
what
the
whole
country
needs
and
when
the
wave
comes
there
will
be
a
lot

arrived

the

sales
of
these
barrels
were
from
canada
and
from
the
united
states
last
year
i
sold
for
export
barrels
of
apples
the
buyer
told
me
it
was
very
difficult
to
carry
barreled
apples
across
the
water
in
good
condition
and
that
owing
to
the
peculiar
motion
of
the
ship
apples
which
were
tight
when
loaded
would
be
loose
and
bruised
on
arrival
at
liverpool
you
may
judge
of
the
correctness
of
this
statement
when
i
tell
you
that
in
the
account
of
sales
of
barrels
are
reported
as
loose
and
tight
they
are
not

county
i

for

apple
this
is
not
only
a
good
apple
for
the
table
but
it
is
also
one
of
the
very
finest
cider
fruits
and
its
fruitfulness
renders
it
a
great
favorite
with
orchardists
the
tree
grows
rather
irregularly
and
does
not
form
a
handsome
head
but
it
bears
early
and
the
apples
have
the
good
quality
of
hanging
late
upon
the
trees
without
injury
while
the
tree
thrives
well
on

the

is
desirable
because
of

deep
rich
color
its
attractiveness
and

its
one
principal
defect
is
over

it
is
a
good

holman
the
excellences
of
the

consist
in
its
color
its
flavor
and
its
keeping
quality
i
would
not
recommend
it
for

commercial
orchard
i
recommend
it
for
the
family
orchard
only
gano
missouri
that
is
my
view
i
would
not
recommend
it
as
a
commercial
apple
the
tree
grows
straggling
and
is
subject
to
insects
and
the
winds
affect
them
greatly
making
them
unprofitable
in
our
orchards
as
a
family
apple
when
grown
to
perfection
we
can
hardly
dispense
with
it
dixon
the
winesap
trees
on
my
farm
are
years
old
and
last
year
yielded
ten
bushels
of
marketable
apples
per
tree
besides
culls
i
would
not
recommend
the
winesap
as
a
commercial
apple
as
it
is
usually
small
phillip
lux
i
must
say
a
good
word
for
the
winesap
it
has
many
traits
against
it
for
profit
yet
i
would
give
it
a
place
in
the
commercial
orchard
it
falls
early
and
must
be
picked
early
but
if
planted
in
good
rich
black
soil
it
will
as
a
rule
do
well
it
commands
a
good
price
and
is
a
good
apple
for
variety
we
can
not
make
it
a
leader
but
should
keep
it
among
our
commercial
apples
james
sharp
morris
county
i
consider
it
a
good
apple
for
my
soil
it
is
a
good
apple
if
planted
in
a
cool
and
moist
red
clay
in
this
they
grow
to
a
marketable
size
holsinger
i
think
i
would
not
plant
another
winesap
unless
for
family
use
i
would
place
it
fifth
or
sixth
on
the
list
after
one
or
two
good
crops
they
generally
play
out
this
year
they
were
about
the
size
of
robison
the
winesap
in
butler
county
is
prone
to
spur
blight
in
summer
when
the
hot
sun
comes
they
dry
up
in
clusters
as
far
south
as
we
are
they
are
hardly
profitable
farther
north
they
do
better
in
illinois
from
one
square
of
trees
winesaps
i
gathered
bushels
of
apples
in
bailey
i
know
no
better
apple
for
family
use
in
our
country
in
the
low
lands
they
are
fine
of
fair
size
producing
well
while
the
tree
is
young
the
fruit
is
fine
after
it
gets
older
it
overbears
and
the
fruit
becomes
small
i
would
not
plant
it
for
market
william
cutter
geary
county
i
consider
the
winesap
good
for
family
orchards
but
when
old
inclined
to
overbear
which
enfeebles
the
tree
while
the
tree
is
young
it
is
among
the
best
it
does
not
pay
for
market
smith
i
would
drop
it
from
the
commercial
list
if
i
were
to
plant
trees
i
would
plant
only
winesaps
i
prefer
the
ben
davis
but
we
should
not
all
grow
the
same
apple
we
want
variety
william
cutter
every
one
likes
winesaps
but
we
can
not
grow
them
at
ordinary
prices
george
whiteker
shawnee
county
i
do
not
know
a
better
apple
as
remarked
when
the
tree
gets
old
the
fruit
runs
down
in
size
it
is
very
deceiving
when
it
appears
overloaded
there
are
often
not
many
on
it
president
wellhouse
it
has
disappointed
us
every
year
some
years
they
are
very
full
but
many
go
to

i
vote
against
the
winesap
we
have
not
planted
any
for
ten
years
walter
wellhouse
is
here
he
can
tell
us
about
the
winesap
walter
wellhouse
shawnee
county
my
experience
is
that
like
some
other
apples
they
will
not
grow
in
poor
soils
but
if
the
soil
is
suitable
they
are
profitable
bohrer
rice
county
i
have
noticed
it
is
not
so
much
in
the
quality
of
the
soil
as
the
quantity
of
moisture
in
it
having
trees
on
high
ground
i
irrigated
one
of
them
and
it
bore
fine
apples
in
arkansas
where
the
land
is
too
poor
to
raise
corn
the
winesap
does
well
but
it
will
not
grow
on
high
dry
soil
they
must
have
more
than
the
ordinary
amount
of

i
examined

its
great

remarks
on
the
jonathan
by
members
of
the
state
horticultural
society
bohrer
jonathan
is
probably
the
best
apple
i
grow
they
sell
for
the
highest
price
in
the
general
market
they
produce
fewer
culls
than
other
varieties
it
is
not
a
profuse
bearer
as
far
south
as
i
am
rice
county
it
ripens
too
early
and
is
affected
by
strong
winds
holman
the
jonathan
is
one
of
the
most
desirable
apples
excellent
as
a
dessert
fruit
of
a
beautiful
deep
bright
color
of
good
quality
and
strong
constitution
it
is
often
called
a
fall
apple
yet
if
put
in
cold
storage
it
may
be
brought
out
even
in
june
in
good
condition
i
place
it
third
as
a
commercial
fruit
gano
the
jonathan
should
be
picked
early
and
put
in
cold
storage
i
would
place
it
second
as
a
commercial
apple
griffing
riley
county
we
consider
it
about
fourth
on
the
list
as
a
commercial
apple
j
mcafee
it
is
large
and
about
the
second
for
profits
in
my
orchard
which
has
been
planted
years
dixon
i
would
place
the
jonathan
about
third
as
a
commercial
apple
in
our
county
it
is
longer
lived
than
any
other
apple
tree
and
freer
from
insects
james
sharp
its
only
objection
is
its
inclination
to
fall
i
suppose
if
picked
early
and
put
in
cold
storage
they
may
be
as
good
but
do
not
look
as
well
walter
wellhouse
i
think
the
demand
for
jonathan
is
declining
some
among
large
dealers
a
few
years
ago
they
sold
for
an
advance
of
from
fifty
cents
to
one
dollar
per
barrel
in
minneapolis
and
chicago
the
market
still
seems
good
for
them
but
if
i
were
to
plant
now
i
would
not
plant
as
many
jonathans
as
five
or
ten
years
ago
whiteker
the
jonathan
sells
better
in
our
market
topeka
than
any
other
apple
they
have
a
good
reputation
none
better
they
must
be
picked
early
phillip
lux
i
would
place
it
fifth
commercially
it
drops
so
early
before
coloring
up
it
stands
more
abuse
than
any
other
apple
we
have
and
if
gathered
early
will
keep
even
without
cold
storage
until
the
market
improves
bohrer
i
agree
with
sharp
i
think
the
farther
west
we
go
the
poorer
the
fruit
gets
you
have
more
rainfall
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
state
it
is
hardy
possibly
hardier
than
ben
davis
but
it
falls
early
it
is
much
like
winesap
requiring
more
moisture
than
other
varieties
when
not
much
exposed
to
winds
it
does
well
of
late
our
rainfall
is
not
sufficient
and
they
are
not
doing
so
well
but
since
trying
irrigation
they
do
better
william
cutter
i
live
too
far
west
for
the
jonathan
it
will
not
stand
drought
or
wind
it
ripens
too
early
it
is
a
apple
the
worst
spur

i
ever
saw
was
on

smith
it
is
a
good
apple
if
there
is
plenty
of
moisture
they
do
fine
i
gather
them
about
the
of
september
and
they
keep
until
the
next
spring
i
tried
to
see
how
long
i
could
keep
them
they
should
be
about

cook
i
am
a
warm

of

vote
it
second
it
is
a
tree
but
brings
paying
returns
for
expense
and
trouble
it
has
a
fairly
good
flavor
robison
the
missouri
pippin
is
a
young
and
profuse
bearer
and
quite
hardy
with
me
i
should
place
it
second
on
the
list
holman
i
have
eliminated
it
from
my
family
orchard
and
give
it
only
as
a
commercial
fruit
and
there
rate
it
second
in
quality
there
can
be
more
money
made
from
it
in
a
few
years
than
from
any
apple
we
have
it
is
the
youngest
bearing
tree
we
have
it
grows
to
a
good
size
and
by
some
is
preferred
to
ben
davis
the
great
merit
of
this
apple
is
in
its
youthful
productiveness
good
color
and
marketable
quality
gano
i
do
not
approve
of
planting
it
thickly
intending
to
let
it
remain
it
is
apt
to
overbear
break
in
pieces
and
become
almost
worthless
with
proper
care
and
thinning
when
too
thick
we
can
partially
overcome
this
griffing
it
is
my
second
best
apple
i
consider
the
winesap
the
best
as
it
has
paid
me
the
best
and
i
am
planting
for
winter
profit
only
these
two
all
apple
trees
die
young
with
us
dixon
i
can
add
nothing
new
but
place
it
second
on

james

it
has
been
my
most
profitable
variety
about
have
been

to

would
rather
grow

president

we
will
have
to
stick
to
it
awhile
yet
in
kansas
when
of
good
size
they
command
a
price
in
advance
of
the
ben
davis
whiteker
it
gives
good
satisfaction
as
a
commercial
apple
it
bears
young
and
you
can
get
good
returns
for
eight
or
ten
years

then
put

remarks
on
the
gano
by
members
of
the
state
horticultural
society
gano
i
can
not
be
against
my
namesake
i
have
found
nothing
yet
that
excels
the
parent
trees
the
gano
is
creating
a
sensation
more
especially
in
the
southern
part
of
missouri
they
prefer
it
to
ben
davis
and
where
extensively
planted
and
in
bearing
it
is
creating
a
sensation
while
i
have
no
interest
in
it
other
than
the
name
still
i
think
we
have
in
the
gano
something
that
will
stay
it
is
much
like
ben
davis
holman
i
would
class
it
and
the
ben
davis
as
twins
james
sharp
i
planted
about
trees
of
it
five
years
ago
this
year
i
raised
five
apples
two
of
these
could
not
be
told
from
ben
davis
one
looked
like
jonathan
william
cutter
i
class
it
with
ben
davis
it
differs
little
except
in
color
trees
are
alike
but
i
think
it
a
younger
bearer
i
got
my
grafts
from
lee
summit
paying
five
dollars
per
for
them
one
tree
i
gave
to
a
friend
was
this
year
a
wonder
to
all
who
saw
it
president
wellhouse
we
have
seventy
or
eighty
acres
in
gano
planted
five
or
six
years
ago
while
the
tree
is
much
like
ben
davis
i
can
distinguish
a
difference
in
the
apples
if
i
pile
both
kinds
together
i
can
see
a
difference
if
i
pick
out
a
gano
and
put
it
in
the
ben
davis
pile
neither
i
nor
any
other
man
on
earth
can
tell
it
from
the
ben
davis
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
distinct
from
the
ben
davis
or
not
if
it
is
ben
davis
it
is
all
right
i
hope
it
is
distinct
but
have
so
far
been
unable
to
settle
the
question
gano
we
originally
found
only
one
tree
in
an
orchard
in
pratt
county
missouri
and
in
the
same
orchard
there
were
plenty
of
ben
davis
trees
there
may
have
been
a
of
these
varieties
but
you
will
not
be
disappointed
if
you
get
the
gano
president
wellhouse
before
planting
i
went
to
lee
summit
for
three
or
four
years
in
succession
and
examined
the
original
trees
to
see
whether
we
ought
to
plant
any
we
concluded
to
plant
for
if
they
were
not
a
new
apple
they
would
be
the
ben
davis
anyhow
we
may
have
obtained
ben
davis
trees
a
moore
my
husband
handles
many
of
them
on
commission
and
favors
them
both
in
the
orchard
and
in
the
market
he
says
they
are
known
as
jonathan
not
as
gano
and
while
you
may
not
distinguish
them
in
a
pile
of
ben
davis
you
will
know
the
difference
if
you
put
your
teeth

cook
i
have
planted
heavily
of
york
imperial
they
are
not
yet
in
full
bearing
they
have
given
me
good
results
the
trees
are
of
large
size
and
the
growth
indicates
that
they
will
be
strong
bearers
they
are
of
rather
a
twig
growth
i
would
put
them
about
sixth
on
the
commercial
list
holman
the
york
imperial
is
an
old
apple
it
is
new
to
many
of
us
because
of
its
late
sudden
popularity
it
has
been
sent
to
europe
holding
its
own
with
missouri
pippin
and
others
it
is
large
a
good
keeper
and
growers
always
seem
pleased
with
it
it
seems
to
be
growing
popular
james

i
have
about
or
trees
i
planted
on
the
recommendation
of
president
wellhouse
six
years
ago
this
year
they
produced
about
bushels
i
think
they
will
be
profitable
president

i
saw
a
gentleman
from
louis
who
gathered
about
ten
and
he
was
favorably
impressed
with
it
we
have
many
trees
bearing

commence

have
some
that

this

they
were

mature

have
little

recommend

is
succeeded

i
would
not
plant
them

they
are

as
ben

they
fall

james

nearly

never
paid

whiteker
it

we
should
not

maiden

a
remarkably
beautiful
apple
a
native
of

first
described
by
coxe
it
begins
to
ripen
about
the
of
august
and
continues
until
the
last
of
october
it
has
all
the
beauty
of
color
of
the
pretty
little
lady
apple
and
is
much
cultivated
and
admired
both
for
the
table
and
for
cooking
it
is
also
very
highly
esteemed
for
drying
this
variety
forms

by

it
is
all
right
to
raise
for
a

market
and
for
family
use
hardy
tree
i
planted
probably
i
can
not
determine
where
to
place
it
on
the
list
probably
others
have
had
more
experience
with
it
than
i
have
holman
the
maiden
blush
deserves
a
place
in
both
the
family
and
the
commercial
orchard
in
its
season
it
is
unexcelled
for
market
purposes
and
is
especially
attractive
i
should
recommend
it
as
a
commercial
apple
ferris
i
would
place
it
first
as
a
summer
apple
for
local
market
gano
you
certainly
will
not
discard
it
griffing
it
is
about
the
earliest
apple
that
will
bear
shipping
in
summer
and
very
profitable
dixon
i
find
it
rather
a
shy
bearer
but
the
tree
is
and
very
hardy
and
it
deserves
a
place
in
the
family
orchard
i
think
there
is
no
profit
in
them
for
a
commercial
orchard
president
wellhouse
they
are
and
very
hardy
i
would
recommend
them
for
family
but
not
for
commercial
orchard
whiteker
it
comes
at
a
time
when
there
is
much
other
fruit
i
do
not
think
it
pays
very
well
mine
turn
brown
from

cause
phillip
lux
it
is
our
very
best
apple
in
its
season
while
talking
of
the
commercial
orchard
there
is
a
demand
for
apples
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
and
if
we
discard
this
we
will
have
nothing
at
its
season
i
would
say
place
it
in
the
commercial
orchard
for
export
griffing
do
not
know
that
it
is
profitable
but
for
quality
the
maiden
blush
is
worthy
of
a
place
among
fruits
bailey
as
a
summer
apple
for
family
and
commercial
orchards
i
would
place
it
at
the
head
of
the
list
william
cutter
it
is
the
best
apple
of
its
season
for
all
purposes
smith
it
is
the
best
commercial
apple
for
summer
trade
we
have
secretary
barnes
at
the
late
meeting
of
the
missouri
horticultural
society
the
secretary
stated
that
he
thought
there
was
good
money
in
the
maiden
blush
he
said
the
trouble
was
they
were
raised
in
too
limited
quantities
he
said
they
should
be
raised
in
car
lots
for
shipping
to
northern
cities
that
they
were
quick
growers
and
brought
ready
money
and
at
their
season
had
little
competition
in
the
market
they
come
in
when
there
are
few
apples
obtainable
and
he
considers
them
profitable
ferris
in
my
experience
it
bears
only
every
other
year
is
that
the
experience
of
others
president

the
maiden
blush
is
the
only
summer
apple
that
we
have
made
pay
robison
we
have
not
grown
maiden
blush
very
largely
here
it
is
one
of
our
old
apples
in
illinois
and
it
is
the
earliest
most
regular
and
profuse
bearer
and
the
best
keeper
of
its
season
to
ship
in
hot
weather
it
was
named
for
its
beauty
and
is
the
most
attractive
apple
grown
they
last
well
if
kept
moderately
cool
they
are
shipped
largely
in

the
earlier

in

the

cold

i
have
not
tried

ship
any
grimes
golden
i
would
place
it
about
second
on
the
list
of
summer
apples
with
me
it
is
a
good
thrifty
hardy
tree
but
my
orchard
is
young
robison
i
have
grown
it
extensively
it
is
one
of
the
best
fall
apples
and
one
of
the
beauties
it
does
not
keep
well
it
rots
badly
after
it
is
gathered
and
goes
to
market
in
rather
bad
shape
it
is
not
planted
as
much
now
as
in
the
past
holman
it
stands
in
quality
beside
the
jonathan
and
is
a
dessert
apple
it
is
a
good
bearer
and
ought
to
be
in
every
family
orchard
but
i
would
not
recommend
it
for
the
commercial
orchard
ferris
mine
bore
very
heavily
and
were
large
and
fine
sold
well
locally
never
shipped
any
think
they
should
come
next
to
the
blush
in
the
commercial
orchard
gano
the
grimes
golden
is
the
very
best
apple
of
its
season
should
be
in
all
family
orchards
and
have
a
small
place
in
commercial
orchards
j
mcafee
like
gano
i
consider
it
the
very
best
apple
that
grows
and
one
of
the
most
profitable
in
my
orchard
i
find
it
i
take
best
care
of
them
for
use
of
my
family
until
about
the
of
november
dixon
it
is
the
best
apple
for
family
use
but
drops
badly
the
tree
is
a
good
bearer
but
not
whiteker
i
plant
grimes
golden
and
maiden
blush
for

the

brings

at
this

phillip
lux
i
have
had
experience
with
it
for
years
in

orchard
we
can
not
do
without
it
we
aim
to
keep
it
for
our
family
as
long
as
it
lasts
say
until
february
in
my
opinion
it
is
better
than
any
pear
that
grows
in
our
state
we
should
handle
them
with
care
as
we
do
pears
put
away
carefully
in
a
cold
dry
cellar
they
retain
their
flavor
and
keep
well
i
think
them
worthy
of
a

like
to

favorite
by

william

the
huntsman
is
and
deserves

place
in

list
holman
the
huntsman
is
of
the
york
imperial
order
an
old
variety
not
sufficiently
known
in
kansas
city
i
saw
them
on
sale
at
six
dollars
per
barrel
the
tree
is
a
good
bearer
and
will
be
planted
more
than
it
has
been
it
never
blights
smith
i
agree
with
holman
gano
it
is
a
very
desirable
orchard
tree
it
is
just
wonderful
how
our

hold
out
its
quality

size
are
good
it
has
one
fault
if
put
in
cold
storage
it
bleaches
out
as
most
yellow
apples
do
i
can
not
keep
yellow
apples
in
cold
storage
and
the
huntsman
has
disappointed
me
but
if
taken
out
and
sold
when
just
right
it
is
a
success
and
sells
in
kansas
city
at
six
dollars

says
he
brought
to
arkansas
and
planted
seeds
of
the
limber
twig
and
black
twig
over
years

this

sprang
from

his
were
very

also
that

were

holman
many
mammoth
black
twig
trees
have
been
extensively
propagated

we
should
know
more
about
them
this
variety
came
before
the
public
with
a
hurrah
and
people
were
told
it
was
an
apple
with
the
quality
of
winesap
and
the
vigor
of
ben
davis
a
moore
missouri
my
husband
and
i
superintended
sixty
acres
we
grew
bushels
of
them
all
very
fine
of
the
tree
i
know
little
but
the
apples
were
beautiful
they
are
of
dark
color
and
very
handsome
smith
two
years
ago
i
was
down
the
port
arthur
road
and
saw
some
and
they
were
apples
but
on
testing
it
i
thought
many
others
were
better
though
in
the
general
trade
i
think
it
will
do
well
we
have
a
few
trees
and
they
are
rapid
growers
but
i
would
not
recommend
them
for
flavor
adams
i
can
give
you
no
particular
information
on
this
apple
but
believe
in
the
right
location
it
is
as

maxey
i
am
greatly
interested
in
it
very
late
last
spring
while
in

city
i
noticed
a
variety
of
apples
that
looked
so
fresh
with
stems
as
green
as
if
just
picked
in
shape
and
color
like
large
janets
they
had
come
out
of
cold

i
asked
the
name
and
was
told
they
were
ingram
i
was
told
they
were
grown
in
the
vicinity
of
garden
city
kan
i
wrote
to
garden
city
and
received
an
answer
from
the

saying
this
apple
was
well
worthy
of
growing
a
moore
i
have
seen
it
kept
until
the
following
august
whiteker
i
got
twenty
barrels
of

from
rose
in

i
brought
them
here
topeka
and
retailed
most
of
them
and
got
six
dollars
per

for

i
do
not
think
we
found

thought

the

to

are
two

the

or
limbs
not
over
two

from

we
grow
most
of
our
trees
from
our
own
root
grafts
cultivation
we
cultivate
for
the
first
five
years
by
throwing
the
soil
first
to
and
then
from
the
trees
with
a
single
or
a
double
turning
plow
and
grow
only
corn
at
five
years
from
planting
we
sow
the
ground
to
clover
and
this
with
other
growths
such
as
weeds
is
left
on
the
ground
as
a
mulch
and
fertilizer
we
have
never
used
any
windbreaks
at
any
of
our
orchards
think
they
would
be
an
advantage
in
some
localities
we
use
traps
for
rabbits
knife
and
wire
for
borers
we
prune
very
little
such
as
removing
broken
limbs
we
have
never
fertilized
any
of
our
orchards
we
do
not
believe
it
pays
to
pasture
orchards
and
do
not
allow
it
the
insects
that
trouble
us
most
are
bud

roundheaded
borer
and
the
caterpillar
on

and
gouger

cricket
on

in

we
spray

named
using
london
purple

adding

we
spray
before

opens
for

moth
and
and
after
the
petals
have
fallen
for
and
fall
we
have
been
successful
except
as
to

we
believe
we
have
greatly
reduced

we

we

we
have
as
yet
found
no
particular
method
for
fighting
the
bud
moth
successfully
we
gather
our
apples
by
hand
in
common
seamless
sacks
used
in
the
same
manner
as
for
sowing
grain
a
strap
of
heavy
leather
is
attached
making
it
easy
for
the
shoulder
a
hook
and
ring
are
also
put
on
to
facilitate
the
removal
of
the
sack
when
emptying
we
prefer
common
straight
ladders
with
sides
from
sixteen
to
twenty
inches
apart
at
the
bottom
and
six
inches
at
the
top
rounds
fourteen

we
use

boxes
for
hauling

sort

three
grades
no

culls

are
all

apples
of
about
from
two

to
two
and
inches

the
size
of
the
smallest
depending
on
the
variety
we
put
in
the
no
grade
those
that
have
any
defects
barring
them
from
the
first
grade
yet
they
make
a
good
for
immediate
use
we
also
pack
in
this
grade
any
sound
apples
that
run
uniformally
small
of
all
packages
tried
we
prefer
and
use
the
barrel
inch
head
and
inch
stave
when
one
head
is
removed
the
barrel
is
turned
over
and
a
rap
with
the
hand
removes
all
trash
if
we
are
packing
a
fine
grade
of
fruit
we
put
a
piece
of
white
paper
cut
a
little
less
than
the
diameter
of
the
barrel
in
before
facing
barrels
are

we
are
careful
to
have
the
barrels
rocked
or
shaken
often
while
being

we
use
the
new
york
hop
kiln
rival
no
parers
and
upright

all
of
which
have
been
reasonably
satisfactory
we
believe
them
the
best
we
can
get
considering
the
class
of
evaporated
fruit
in

white

is
best
handled
in

we
always
found
a

some
years
it
paid
well
we

i
never

think
it

my

i
pick

i
sort

i
pick
to
avoid

putting

the

in

cover
them
with

and
let
them
stay
out
as
long

dare
then
put

but
the
cellar
is
too
warm
think
an
outdoor
cellar
or
cave
would
be
better
would
like
to
put
them
in
cold

which
is
far
the
best
i
sell
my
apples
in

or
any

i
can

generally
take

i
have

have
about

the
best
varieties
of

for

are
not
many
no
one
variety
could
be
named

would
be

pippin
willow

park
keeper
are
all
valuable
sorts
there
are
others
a
family
orchard
is
the
most
important
orchard
a
farmer
plants
it
should
contain
a
small
number
of
trees
and
a
large
number
of
varieties
two
of
a
kind
are
a
plenty
there
should
be
at
least
twenty
kinds
that
will
allow
for
a
new
variety
to
ripen
in
its
season
every
two
weeks
or
less
in
summer
and
fall
and
every
three
weeks
during
the
winter
they
should
begin
with
the
earliest
and
finish
with
the
very
longest
keeper
these
varieties
will
overlap
so
that
the
farmer
will
almost
always
have
two
sorts
to
choose
from
there
should
be
sweet
apples
among
them
particularly
winter
sweets
the
names
characteristics
qualities
description
of
the
twenty
to
thirty
varieties
that
make
up
an
ideal
orchard
would
require
a
long
chapter
if
the
subject
was
fully
treated
beginners
in
tree
buying
should
be
cautioned
not
to
let
the
nurseryman
run
in
half
a
dozen
trees
of
each
kind
for
the
family
orchard
on
them
two
trees
of
a
kind
are
plenty
particularly
as
the
surplus
of
the
family
orchard
commonly
goes
to
waste
the
names
should
be
carefully
registered
so
there
will
be
no
wondering
what
an
apple
is
when
it
begins
to
bear
you
ca
keep
company
satisfactorily
with
an
apple
that
you
do
know
the
name
of
any
better
than
you
can
an
unknown
man
the
best
place
to
keep
these
family
apples
is
in
a
dugout
in
the
side
of
a
bank
if
possible
at
all
events
good
and
deep
with
the
door
at
the
north
and
a
good
in
the
south
end
i
do
know
much
about
soils
or
location
i
found
myself
in
possession
of
some
kaw
river
timbered
hills
clay
soil
carrying
some
sand
not
good
for
much
else
so
i
planted
them
tops
sides
and
draws
with
apple
trees
which
have
done
well
on
the
tops
of
the
hills
sides
of
the
hills
and
in
the
valleys
between
the
hills
am
inclined
to
suspect
there
is
a
great
deal
of
gammon
written
about
slope
and
expanse
for
orchards
my
conclusion
is
that
that
is
a
good
slope
which
you
happen
to
have
trees
growing
in
the
kaw
bottoms
themselves
i
observe
thrive
and
bear
the
only
cultivation
i
have
ever
given
trees
has
been
such
as
they
got
by
being
component
parts
of
a
except
that
i
have
mainly
given
the
tree
rows
extra
cultivation
keeping
them
clean
of
grass
and
weeds
my
orchards
are
now
seeded
to
clover
clover
is
not
valuable
for
its
own
sake
among
trees
but
the
trees
thrive
with
it
its
greatest
use
so
far
as
i
can
see
is
to
make
you
mow
the
orchard
where
it
is
twice
during
the
season
i
prefer
to
stop
cultivation
in
orchards
when
they
are
six
years
old
i
have
no
knowledge
of
windbreaks
but
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
mechanical
destruction
done
by
borers
and
rabbits
both
these
pests
are
good
mechanics
in
their
way
and
willing
to
work
i
have
the
borers
hunted
spring
and
fall
small
trees
i
have
protected
from
rabbits
by
stalks
paper
or
veneering
rabbits
are
not
hard
to
head
off
but
they
wo
let
a
case
go
by
default
some
people
depend
upon
traps
dogs
guns
poison
cats
washes
wagon
grease
and
liver
to
keep
the
rabbits
away
i
have
known
all
of
these
to
fail
but
i
have
never
known
a
tree
well
tied
up
with
to
suffer
from
mechanical
destruction
via
the
rabbit
route
unless
the
string
broke
there
is
no
law
against
having
a
good
string
the
only
pruning
i
have
ever
done
has
been
to
take
out
water
sprouts
i
do
know
whether
it
paid
or
not
but
i
like
the
looks
of
a
tree
better
without
the
pompadour
effect
a
top
full
of
sprouts
gives
it
never
have
thinned
apples
orchards
here
are
by
picking
time
the
fruit
is
fully
half
on
the
ground
and
commonly
not
too
much
on
the
trees
have
never
used
manure
or
any
fertilizer
on
apple
trees
i
never
pastured
an
orchard
but
once
one
trial
cured
me
i
judge
that
one
trial
is
nearly
always
enough
it
is
not
advisable
to
pasture
orchards
not
even
with
hogs
the
greatest
pest
we
have
is
the
apple
worm
son
i
am
told
of
the
have
made
no
effort
to
check
it
by
spraying
or
otherwise
i
pick
apples
by
hand
drop
them
into
a
sack
hung
over
the
shoulder
when
the
sack
is
full
it
is
emptied
onto
a
sorting
table
make
two
classes
of
fruit
no
and
culls
have
never
used
any
package
but
the
barrel
prefer
the
flour
barrel
fill
barrel
full
enough
to
prevent
rattling
when
head
is
pressed
in
mark
faced
head
with
variety
quality
and
my
name
and
address
have
never
sold
crop
in
orchard
often
sell
culls
there
have
never
sold
a
greater
amount
than
one
at
one
time
have
sold
as
little
as
one
peck
the
best
market
is
sometimes
at
one
place
sometimes
at
another
minneapolis
is
the
most
distant
market
i
have
ever
tried
have
mostly
put
my
apples
in
cold
storage
about
one
time
out
of
three
they
have
kept
well
the
fault
was
not
in
the
apples
cold
storage
is
either
not
understood
or
frequently
mismanaged
people
should
be
made
to
guarantee
their
work
should
not
be
paid
for
apples
that
are
not
delivered
in
the
spring
rates
fifty
cents
per

are
absurdly
high
i
use

i
have
been
on

thirteen
years

since

have
set

now
on
it
trees
that
i
set
out
in
the
spring
of
measure
six
to
ten
inches
in

in
i
put
out

trees
in
i
planted
more
part
of
them

and
when
set
i
lost
only
thirteen
out
of
the
a
few
of
the
missouri
pippins
bore
fruit
last
year
i
consider
the
following
varieties
in
the
order
named
best
for
commercial
orchard
ben
davis
jonathan
winesap
grimes
golden
pippin
and
for
family
use
i
would
add
maiden
blush
cooper
early
white
missouri
pippin
and
rawle
janet
i
have
tried
and
discarded
smith
cider
and
lowell
as
they
blight
too
much
i
prefer
bottom
land
if
it
is
properly
drained
as
it
is
apt
to
be
richer
and
the
trees
will
not
suffer
as
much
in
a
dry
season
black
loam
with
a
porous
subsoil
to
let
the
surplus
water
soak
away
i
think
a
northern
slope
best
as
the
trees
do
not
suffer
as
much
from
the
sun
on
hot
summer
days
apple
trees
have
done
best
for
me
on
a
black
loam
underlaid
with
a
porous
subsoil
that
will
take
the
surplus
water
and
still
hold
moisture
in
summer
i
plant
by
plowing
light
furrows
feet
apart
across
the
lay
of
the
ground
then
plowing
two
or
four
furrows
together
up
and
down
the
slope
feet
apart
and
run
a
lister
in
this
big
furrow
breaking
up
the
ground
as
deeply
as
possible
i
dip
the
roots
of
my
trees
in
lye
water
using
one
pound
carbonate
of
lye
to
eight
gallons
of
water
then
fill
in
with
a
spade
around
the
roots
being
careful
not
to
leave
any
holes
for
mice
to
nest
in
or
trees
with
roots
and
top
well
balanced
no
forks
to
split
down
when
the
tree
gets
older
bark
smooth
and
good
color
i
consider
best
i
prefer
to
grafts
my
experience
is
that
we
get
better
trees
on
piece
roots
as
the
union
is
lower
down
in
the
ground
and
the
scion
throws
out
roots
which
makes
the
trees
healthy
and
not
wholly
dependent
on
seedling
roots
i
cultivate
my
orchard
till
ten
or
twelve
years
old
and
keep
all
weeds
and
grass
away
using
an
plow
with
one
horse
next
to
the
trees
and
backfurrow
to
every
other
row
then
use
two
horses
and
plow
for
the
middles
the
next
year
i
backfurrow
to
the
rows
left
the
year
before
in
this
way
we
have
no
large
back
or
dead
furrows
but
keep
the
ground
level
in
cultivating
i
use
a
peerless
harrow
each
side
of
the
row
and
cultivate
the
rest
with
cultivator
then
use
a
good
sharp
hoe
close
to
the
trees
corn
is
the
best
crop
to
raise
among
young
trees
as
it
acts
as
a
windbreak
and
a
partial
shade
after
an
orchard
gets
to
bearing
seed
to
red
clover
i
would
change
from
corn
to
clover
eight
or
nine
years
after
setting
windbreaks
are
essential
i
would
have
them
on
the
south
and
west
sides
of
the
orchard
at
least
i
would
make
them
of
evergreen
osage
orange
or
mulberry
i
would
not
plant
black
walnut
cottonwood
or
maple
as
they
are
injurious
to
apple
trees
plant
peach
trees
between
the
apple
trees
they
grow
fast
and
protect
the
apple
until
large
enough
to
stand
the
winds
the
best
thing
i
have
found
to
keep
rabbits
mice
off
the
trees
is
a
protector
made
of
five
lath
two
feet
long
woven
with
wire
they
can
be
left
on
summer
and
winter
as
sunlight
and
air
can
pass
through
to
the
bark
and
keep
it
healthy
and
keep
the
sun
from
scalding
the
bark
it
also
keeps
the
borers
and
the
whippletree
from
doing
much
damage
they
can
be
left
on
until
the
trees
outgrow
them
i
cut
out
all
limbs
that
are
liable
to
rub
each
other
at
any
future
time
and
all
limbs
that
are
liable
to
split
down
as
the
tree
gets
older
i
also
trim
high
enough
to
let
a
small
horse
walk
under
the
limbs
i
take
off
the
back
pad
while
working
among
the
trees
so
it
will
not
be
catching
on
the
limbs
i
think
that
it
pays
and
is
beneficial
i
have
not
thinned
the
fruit
while
on
the
trees
my
trees
are
planted
in
alternate
rows
of
different
kinds
so
i
can
not
tell
what
is
best
blocks
or
mixed
i
use
all
the
litter
broadcast
that
i
can
get
and
wish
i
had
more
i
shall
plow
under
a
good
crop
of
red
clover
about
every
other
year
and
seed
again
the
same
year
to
clover
as
i
think
it
beneficial
i
would
do
the
same
on
all
lands
that
i
have
yet
tried
i
do
not
let
horses
or
cattle
over
one
year
old
pasture
in
the
orchard
i
let
calves
and
small
pigs
have
access
to
the
orchard
as
they
will
eat
up
a
great
many
wormy
apples
that
drop
and
help
keep
down
the
weeds
i
think
it
advisable
to
pasture
with
young
stock
and
that
it
pays
my
apple
trees
are
troubled
with
and
the
troubled
my
apples
some
last
year
i
have
not
tried
spraying
as
yet
i
have
found
borers
in
a
few
trees
that
were
out
in
the
grass
near
the
fence
i
pick
my
apples
by
hand
using
for
the
lower
limbs
and
longer
ladders
wide
at
the
bottom
and
very
narrow
at
the
top
for
the
upper
limbs
while
picking
in
the
inside
of
a
tree
i
use
a
sack
made
to
hang
on
a
limb
and
so
arranged
that
it
can
be
let
to
the
ground
and
emptied
without
getting
out
of
the
tree
i
make
three
grades
of
my
apples
first
good
size
smooth
free
from
worms
and
good
calyx
second
apples
under
size
a
little
specked
and
wormy
third
culls
i
have
been
sorting
from
the
pile
but
think
i
shall
use
a
table
made
with
the
back
end
the
higher
and
the
top
made
of
heavy
canvas
without
end
and
passing
over
rollers
at
each
end
so
the
apples
can
be
brought
in
reach
without
handling
them
then
i
would
arrange
my
barrels
so
that
the
apples
can
be
placed
in
them
without
bruising
i
prefer
the
barrel
to
ship
in
but
for
handling
i
want
a
box
with
handholes
in
the
ends
i
would
pack
the
barrels
as
tight
as
possible
and
then
mark
the
name
of
variety
grade
and
name
of
grower
on
it
i
would
ship
them
by
fast
freight
or
express
sometimes
i
sell
in
the
orchard
i
have
generally
sold
by
retail
and
peddled
as
i
have
a
good
set
of
customers
i
can
do
as
well
to
sell
direct
to
the
consumer
as
to
sell
at
wholesale
i
sell
second
grade
to
any
one
that
will
buy
i
feed
the
culls
to
cattle
and
hogs
and
let
the
hens
have
all
they
want
i
have
had
a
market
near
home
for
all
i
have
grown
may
have
to
look
further
when
all
my
trees
bear
i
have
not
tried
distant
markets
what
i
have
tried
took
all
the
profits
i
do
not
think
it
pays
to
dry
apples
unless
on
an
extensive
scale
i
store
my
apples
for
winter
market
in
a
dry
cellar
i
pack
in
both
barrels
and
boxes
while
in
the
cellar
prefer
boxes
as
they
are
easier
to
handle
and
sort
from
i
have
not
been
as
successful
as
i
would
like
but
think
i
have
done
as
well
as
many
have
with
the
number
of
trees
i
have
the
ben
davis
winesap
and
janet
have
kept
the
best
for
me
i
have
not
tried
artificial
cold
storage
if
apples
are
held
any
length
of
time
i
repack
so
as
to
be
sure
they
are
up
to
grade
i
do
not
lose
over
two
per
cent
in
the
fall
apples
sold
at
about
thirty
cents
per
bushel
and
through
the
winter
fifty
to
eighty
cents
per
bushel
i
employ
careful
men
to
pick
and
handle
my
fruit

to
eighteen

i
have
lived
in
kansas
years
have
an
apple
orchard
planted
from
two
to
forty
years
i
planted
my
first
orchard
in
and
not
knowing
anything
about
what
sorts
would
be
suitable
for
kansas
i
had
to
rely
entirely
on
what
the
missouri
nurserymen
recommended
among
the
sorts
planted
which
proved
failures
were
yellow
bellflower
fulton
strawberry
white

russets
and
some
others
winesap
rawle
janet
dominie
and
white
bellflower
all
did
fairly
well
of
all
the
sorts
the
winesap
has
been
the
most
profitable
if
i
had
planted
that
first
orchard
chiefly
to
winesaps
the
cash
receipts
would
have
been
more
than
double
my
later
experience
and
observations
prove
that

the
most
profitable

rich
soil
and
a
porous
subsoil
i
prefer
vigorous
trees
set
in
rows
two
rods
apart
use
a
potato
hook
i
consider
the
best
plan
of
planting
is
to
throw
two
furrows
together
and
plant
on
this
double
thickness
of
surface
soil
the
roots
will
luxuriate
in
this
bed
of
fertile
soil
and
with
proper
care
the
tree
will
make
a
vigorous
growth
plant
early
in
the
spring
before
the
buds
start
i
cultivate
my
orchard
with
a
disc
harrow
followed
by
a
common
harrow
until
they
begin
to
bear
plant
corn
potatoes
or
other
hoed
crop

windbreaks
are
not

in
eastern
kansas

pruning
should
be
done
at
the
time
of
planting
after
that
give
the
tree
all
the
top
it
can
grow
never
fear
but
the
roots
will
keep
pace
with
the
top
remember
that
every
time
you
cut
out
a
large
limb
you
threaten
the
life
of
the
tree
give
the
tree
plenty
of
room
so
that
the
roots
will
not
overreach
each
other
the
moisture
in
the
soil
is
only
sufficient
for
one
set
of
roots
about
two
rods
apart
is
the
proper
distance
i
prune
with
a
knife
to
keep
the
limbs
from
crossing
i
do
not
thin
the
fruit
while
on
the
trees
they
usually
thin
themselves
my
ben
davis
and
missouri
pippins
are
in
mixed
planting
i
fertilize
my
orchard
with
stable
litter
i
think
it
beneficial
and
would
advise
its
use
on
all
soils
after
the
trees
begin
to
bear
i
pasture
my
orchard
in
the
fall
after
the
fruit
is
gathered
with
horses
i
can
not
see
any
injury
i
never
let
horned
cattle
in
my
trees
are
troubled
with
root
aphis
and
roundhead
borers
i
do
not
spray
i
find
that
all
apples
must
be
gathered
before
they
are
quite
ripe
if
we
want
them
to
keep
well
in
order
to
have
them
in
the
best
condition
for
keeping
they
must
be
picked
without
bruises
i
mine
in
a
sack
over
the
shoulder
they
must
be
kept
perfectly
cool
and
at
an
even
temperature
this
of
course
can
be
done
by
placing
them
in
cold
storage
i
sort
from
a
table
in
the
orchard
into
two
classes
large
and
medium
pack
in

mark
with
grade
and
haul
to

i
sell
apples
in

generally
wholesale
them
sell
the
best
to

sell
the
culls
for
cider
my
best
markets
are
west
and
north
i
have
tried
distant
markets
through
agents
and
found
it
paid
i
do
not
dry
any
apples
but
sell
many
apples
to
the
evaporating
factory
do
not
store
any
sell
in
the

do
not

per
barrel
up
dried
apples
from
four
to
six
cents
per

i
employ
young
men
at
one
dollar
per
day
the
profits
from
a
good
apple
orchard
are
more
than
those
from
any
other
crop
which
requires
no
more
labor
and
expense
the
profits
from
one
good
crop
of
apples
are
more
than
from
three
crops
of
wheat
or
corn
but
as
well
as
the
growing
of
all
other
kinds
of
fruit
requires
constant
patient
labor
and
attention
in
order
to
be
successful
and
even
then
the
money
will
not
come
in
with
a
great
rush
in
conclusion
i
would
say
that
the
business
of
growing
fruit
is
much
more
certain
of
success
than
that
of
mercantile
business
it
has
been
ascertained
from
actual
statistics
that
of
every
merchants
fifty
utterly
fail
in
business
forty
are
only
moderately
successful
and
of
the
remaining
ten
only
one
will
become
rich
griffing
manhattan
were
that
old
fisherman
izaak
walton
alive
and
an
enthusiastic
of
eastern
kansas
he
would
probably
express
himself
in
the
book
he
would
write
the
complete
horticulturist
that
doubtless
god
might
have
made
a
better
apple
country
than
this
but
doubtless
he
never
did
if
there
is
a
strip
of
land
in
the
united
states
equal
in
size
to
the
eastern
third
of
kansas
able
to
grow
as
many
and
as
fine
apples
as
this
particular
strip
it
has
yet
to
be
discovered
our
own
experience
in
this
line
dates
back
just
forty
years
in
the
old
family
shows
the
purchase
by
my
father
of
three
dollars
worth
of
apple
trees
the
number
not
given
this
amount
judiciously
expended
now
would
secure
considerable
nursery
stock
but
the
same
record
shows
the
purchase
the
month
previous
of
wheat
at
two
dollars
per
bushel
sugar
six
pounds
for
one
dollar
flour
five
dollars
per
hundredweight
so
the
number
of
trees
obtained
was
probably
not
large
the
following
year
however
apple
trees
and
some
cherry
trees
were
purchased
at
a
cost
of
these
efforts
to
start
an
orchard
were
successful
the
location
was
on
the
old
homestead
about
two
and
miles
east
of
what
was
at
that
time
a
frontier
village
called
topeka
the
trees
bore
the
first
fruit
in
other
and
more
profitable
orchards
have
been
planted
since
then
on
the
farm
but
a
few
of
the
original
plantation
are
still
standing
and
bearing
occasional
crops
of
fruit
so
my
brother
informs
me
on
locating
at
manhattan
in
the
sod
was
broken
and
the
following
year
an
orchard
was
planted
and
we
have
planted
trees
more
or
less
every
year
since
it
has
proven
a
source
of
pleasure
and
profit
after
it
commenced
bearing
i
do
not
recall
a
year
when
the
crop
was
an
entire
failure
and
though
we
can
not
now
command
two
dollars
per
bushel
as
we
could
for
the
apples
from
the
topeka
orchard
yet
they
have
paid
well
the
number
of
varieties
we
have
tried
is
no
less
than
not
including
seedlings
the
following
varieties
i
would
unhesitatingly
recommend
as
having
proved
profitable
and
more
or
less
hardy
for
early
summer
early
harvest
and
red
astrachan
both
are
tender
apples
when
fully
ripe
and
will
then
not
bear
shipping
well
i
have
found
it
best
to
gather
the
ripest
at
least
every
other
day
and
find
buyers
in
the
local
market
the
next
to
follow
these
chenango
strawberry
blush
and
pennsylvania
red
streak
the
two
latter
are
good
shippers
the
pennsylvania
red
streaks
are
a
decided
success
with
me
and
have
paid
nearly
as
well
as
my
best
winter
sorts
do
fail
to
plant
some
of
them
next
i
would
recommend
the
following
winter
varieties
in
the
order
named
winesap
missouri
pippin
ben
davis
jonathan
and
if
you
like
a
sweet
apple
plant
some
bentley
sweet
if
you
can
obtain
them
i
have
been
obliged
to
some
seedlings
in
order
to
perpetuate
my
own
stock
of
them
i
think
it
is
also
advisable
to
plant
some
rawle
janet
trees
they
are
a
late
bloomer
and
will
occasionally
produce
a
crop
when
the
other
sorts
have
been
injured
by
late
freezing
in
fact
they
have
the
faculty
of
bearing
in
the
off
years
as
we
call
them
years
when
the
balance
of
the
orchard
is
resting
from
previous
labors
much
has
been
said
as
to
the
proper
location
for
an
orchard
bottom
land
or
hilltop
level
ground
or
sloping
the
fact
is
with
careful
attention
to
the
trees
any
good
rich
soil
will
answer
anything
that
can
in
a
measure
ward
off
the
evil
effects
of
the
fierce
summer
gales
and
the
droughts
of
july
august
and
september
will
tend
to
minimize
the
losses
were
it
possible
for
me
to
choose
a
piece
of
land
exactly
to
my
notions
i
should
select
a
farm
in
the
neck
of
some
large
horseshoe
being
where
it
would
be
possible
for
the
trees
to
reach
down
their
roots
and
draw
moisture
during
the
dry
season
by
natural
subirrigation
marketing
the
crop
is
the
last
but
not
the
least
work
of
the
in
fact
when
the
orchard
is
well
established
this
is
about
the
only
work
connected
with
the
orchard
and
in
that
respect
the
orchard
has
a
decided
advantage
over
other
farm
crops
that
require
yearly
preparation
of
the
soil
sowing
harrowing
cultivating
as
well
as
the
harvesting
of
the
crop
the
early
summer
apples
can
usually
be
sold
on
the
local
market
at
fair
prices
the
later
summer
and
fall
can
be
shipped
and
are
usually
in
fair
demand
by
western
buyers
ship
only
your

it
will
hardly
pay
to
send
any
other
grade
there
is
usually
a
good
demand
at
this
point
for
winter
varieties
by
farmers
from
the
west
who
come
in
and
buy
their
winter
supply
by
the
occasionally
if
the
eastern
crop
is
short
buyers
from
chicago
will
be
on
the
ground
we
do
not
believe
in
holding
apples
long
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
higher
prices
cold
storage
will
solve
this
difficulty
of
the
orchardist
we
hope
it
will
prove
a
success
the
most
convenient
thing
to
gather
apples
in
from
a
tree
or
ladder
that
we
have
tried
is
a
picking
sack
a
grain
sack
with
a
heavy
wire
or
a
stiff
leather
strap
fastened
around
the
mouth
and
a
broad
strap
connecting
the
top
with
the
bottom
of
the
sack
this
can
be
carried
over
the
shoulder
with
considerable
comfort
there
are
always
more
or
less
inferior
and
unmarketable
apples
left
after
the
best
have
been
disposed
of
and
what
to
do
with
them
is
a
question
that
confronts
every
great
apple
grower
for
the
last
fourteen
years
we
have
been
working
this
grade
into
vinegar
we
found
there
was
considerable
to
learn
and
care
exercised
to
avoid
losses
i
will
mention
a
few
important
things
that
are
necessary
to
produce
a
good
article
of
cider
vinegar
first
obtain
good
oak
barrels
vinegar
or
whisky
barrels
preferred
never
use
soft
wood
barrels
of
any
kind
paint
them
well
with
ocher
before
using
they
will
last
longer
after
filling
with
cider
keep
in
a
shed
until
cool
weather
then
draw
off
and
run
into
barrels
in
the
cellar
for
winter
although
if
well
protected
and
not
too
full
they
could
remain
out
in
the
shed
over
winter
in
the
spring
draw
off
again
and
run
into
other
barrels
you
will
in
this
hasten
the
fermentation
of
vinegar
and
obtain
an
article
free
from
sediment
it
requires
from
one
to
two
years
for
vinegar
to
cease
working
sell
it
then
and
not
before
though
it
may
be
very
strong
it
will
not
keep
pickles
unless
the
process
is
complete
much
of
the
vinegar
sold
on
the
markets
as
apple
vinegar
is
made
from
corn
and
now
that
corn
has
risen
in
price
it
is
possible
that
the
price
of
this
kind
of
vinegar
may
rise
also
it
has
not
the
quality
or
flavor
of
cider
vinegar
but
it
can
be
manufactured
so
cheaply
that
it
has
hurt
the
market
for
a
better
article

from

through
lack
of
knowing
what

the

great
and
good
work

i
have
never

yet

read

but
what
was
in
full
sympathy
with
your
labors
but
wondered
why
more
reports
were
not
sent
out
i
think
our
legislators
should
be
more
wise
consequently
more
liberal
in
their
appropriations
for
the
work
and
distribution
of
the
same
not
only
to
the
farmers
but
to
people
in
towns

cities
their
needs
are
in

great
as

how
every

we

all

was
kept
away
from
bodies
of

i
believe
it
all
nonsense
not
to
prune
but
it
should
be
done
while
they
are
young
my
observation
has
been
all
my
life
that
a
tree
is
longer
lived
has
more
bushels
of
fruit
of
better
quality
smoother
limbs
and
trunks
so
i
would
say
if
you
do
not
intend
to
protect
the
bodies
of
your
young
trees
and
prune
do
not
buy
or
plant
them
it
does
not
do
to
sow
oats
wheat
rye
millet
or
any
grain
crops
in
your
orchard
it
is
an
easy
way
to
keep
weeds
down
and
a
sure
way
to
kill
your
orchard
it
does
not
pay
to
pasture
even
with
calves
chickens
are
at
all
times
beneficial
hogs
after
your
orchard
has
matured
so
the
trees
can
resist
the
hog
when
he
rubs
against
them
which
the
hog
is
sure
to
do
and
perhaps
he
will
pull
some
of
the
lower
limbs
i
have
never
sprayed
but
firmly
believe
it
profitable
next
year
i
expect
to
plant
out
a
new
orchard
and
cultivate
along
the
line
of
the
one

planted

were
the
only

that
paid

fifteen

fifteen

bottom
sloping

on

i
put
nothing

gano

and
jonathan
the
ben
davis
every
fifth
row
with
the
mammoth
black

jonathan
and
winesap
i
believe
that
is
beneficial
to
an
orchard
in
making
fruit
more
plentiful
larger
smoother
better
color
and
quality
it
is
believed
by
many
that
ben
davis
jonathan
and
winesap
are
and
do
require
crossing
that
being
the
case
they
should
have
the
cross
near
by
in
order
to
not
decrease
the
species
or
run
it
out
professor
darwin
says
is
abhorrent
to
nature
and
the
same
rule
that
applies
to
small
fruits
is
equally
applicable
to
apples
why
not
fruits
and
premium
awards
are
my
best
advertisers
i
have
succeeded
in
carrying
off
most
of
the
awards
in
every
show
i
exhibited
at
and
have
premiums
on
file
to
show
for
some
all
my
fruits
are
set
for
and
i
shall
continue
to
set
that
way
many
have
said
and
will
say
they
see
no
difference
perhaps
they
are
not
close
observers
and
have
given
the
subject
little
study
i
have
given
the
subject
years
study
and
experience
and
think
i
am
not
mistaken
i
think
there
is
more
money
to
be
made
on
our
high
upland
in
pears
small
fruits
and
stone
fruits
they
pay
me
better
than
apples
the
grimes
golden
pippin
would
be
a
good
apple
to
grow
if
the
trees
did
not
die
after
two
or
three
crops
the
lawver
apples
fail
to
hang
on
the
trees
the
missouri
pippin
will
not
stand
up
on
our
high
land
unless
surrounded
by
windbreaks
they
look
here
like
a
kansas
cyclone
had
passed
through
them
the
limbs
all
blew
off
last
fall
winesaps
fall
off
badly
and
are
affected
with
bitter
rot
for
trial
purposes
i
recommend
mammoth
black

gano
and
york
imperial
stayman
leavenworth
leavenworth
county
we
came
to
kansas
years
ago
and
traveling
over
the
eastern
portion
of
the
state
selected
leavenworth
as
the
most
desirable
point
to
commence
tree
and
we
were
then
engaged
in
that
business
in
illinois
and
had
collected
over
varieties
of
apples
which
we
brought
to
kansas
among
them
were
nearly
all
the
leading
varieties
then
grown
and
many
new
and
rare
kinds
of
local
reputation
our
object
in
making
this
collection
was
to
grow
them
side
by
side
under
the
same
conditions
to
ascertain
their
value
in
we
set
an
orchard
of
a
few
hundred
trees
consisting
of
about
seventy
varieties
two
years
old
among
them
were
ben
davis
winesap
york
imperial
willow
twig
rambo
rawle
janet
white
pippin
and
jonathan
and
the
leading
apples
generally
grown
including
summer
and
fall
varieties
at
the
same
time
we
set
out
about
root
grafts
in
a
nursery
we
then
collected
over
more
scions
and
them
into
standard
trees
to
get
the
fruit
sooner
over
of
these
were
received
from
the
late
charles
downing
from
this
collection
and
from
specimens
of
fruit
received
we
have
been
able
to
accurately
describe
over
varieties
with
an
outline
cut
of
each
with
seeds
and
core
and
all
other
characteristics
and
to
ascertain
what
effect
climate
had
upon
each
variety
we
kept
an
accurate
meteorological
record
of
the
weather
this
we
furnished
to
the
smithsonian
institution
washington
for
ten
years
we
also
grew
the
leading
varieties
on
an
elevation
feet
higher
and
on
various
aspects
not
over
two
miles
apart
and
learned
what
effect
elevation
and
aspect
had
upon
the
bearing
quality
of
different
varieties
for
commercial
orchard
i
prefer
stayman
winesap
york
imperial
jonathan
and
white
pippin
it
will
be
noticed
that
in
the
commercial
list
we
omitted
ben
davis
missouri
pippin
gano
and
willow
twig
these
varieties
are
all
productive
and
profitable
but
we
believe
the
time
has
come
or
soon
will
be
that
the
public
will
demand
something
better
and
to
meet
this
demand
we
have
made
the
change
but
to
those
who
do
not
believe
in
progress
the
above
varieties
will
prove
at
least
productive
if
not
so
profitable
as
in
the
past
in
making
out
the
list
of
apples
we
have
hesitated
somewhat
in
heading
the
list
with
stayman
not
from
any
doubt
about
the
apple
but
from
the
fact
that
it
is
not
generally
known
but
this
objection
can
be
made
against
any
apple
when
first
introduced
the
following
is
the
description
we
gave
years
ago
in
our
fruit
notes
fruit
large
heavy
form
oblate
conic
regular
color
greenish
yellow
mostly
covered
splashed
and

good
to

january
to
may
seedling
of
winesap
bore
the
ninth
year
from
the
seed
after
fruiting
this
apple
over
twenty
years
we
can
add
the
following
it
is
a
strong
grower
has
a
darker
leaf
is
a
better
bearer
hangs
on
the
tree
better
is
of
larger
size
is
of
much
better
quality
and
will
keep
better
than
winesap
charles
downing
gave
a
similar
description
of
this
apple
in
his
appendix
stayman
winesap
j
black
of
ohio
one
of
the
pomologists
who
has
fruited
it
for
years
puts
it
at
the
head
of
both
the
commercial
and
family
lists
and
says
it
has
all
the
qualities
of
the
winesap
without
any
of
its
faults
van
deman
who
has
fruited
it
and
seen
it
fruited
in
delaware
puts
it
at
the
head
of
the
list
and
writes
in
respect
to
the
change
of
name
stayman
apple
is
worth
almost
a
lifetime
to
produce
now
i
have
been
so
impressed
with
its
coming
value
and
popularity
that
i
have
thought
it
ought
to
be
shortened
in
name
to
kerr
of
delaware
says
it
is
superior
to
its
parent
the
winesap
in
size
color
flavor
and
keeping
quality
the
tree
is
more
vigorous
in
growth
after
several
fruiting
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
it
is
the
finest
winter
apple
that
has
come
under
my
notice
professor
heiges
writes
us
about
the
same
in
substance
prof
powell
of
the
delaware
experiment
station
says
in
quality
it
equals
the
northern
spy
and
is
in
season
from
october
to
may
we
could
give
many
quotations
of
equal
value
from
new
fruit
and
stockman
and
since
writing
the
above
we
find
the
following
in
the
paper
of
may
one
variety
stayman
mentioned
frequently
in
these
columns
a
seedling
raised
by
our
correspondent
stayman
of
kansas
from
the
old
winesap
receives
special
commendation
it
is
remarkable
that
in
the
wide
section
of
country
between
kansas
and
delaware
in
ohio
indiana
pennsylvania
and
missouri
wherever
this
variety
has
been
tried
it
has
developed
the
same
excellences
of
size
quality
and
keeping
as
well
as
of
vigor
and
productiveness
lovers
of
choice
apples
will
not
fail
to
make
a
note
of
this
winesap
we
place
second
on
the
list
after
a
fair
trial
of
over
years
side
by
side
with
ben
davis
give
it
good
soil
and
high
cultivation
and
but
few
apples
will
excel
it
york
imperial
we
place
third
it
is
not
of
the
highest
quality
but
it
is
better
than
ben
davis
and
will
keep
in
a
common
cellar
and
command
a
high
price
it
is
very
productive
in
alternate
years
and
a
hardy
tree
although
we
introduced
this
apple
into
the
state
years
ago
yet
its
commercial
value
is
scarcely
known
jonathan
perhaps
should
stand
at
the
head
of
the
list
for
its
great
beauty
fine
quality
and
productiveness
but
it
matures
so
early
drops
so
badly
keeps
so
poorly
and
requires
so
much
care
in
handling
that
we
hesitate
doing
so
it
is
however
a
very
profitable
apple
when
well
handled
and
can
not
be
omitted
as
no
other
in
its
season
equals
it
white
pippin
this
apple
of
unknown
origin
and
seldom
mentioned
should
be
better
known
as
it
is
far
superior
to
the
famous
newtown
or
albemarle
pippin
of
the
same
type
we
have
had
it
in
bearing
on
high
and
low
land
as
long
as
any
other
apple
and
find
it
very
productive
in
alternate
years
of
the
best
quality
and
bringing
the
best
price
it
keeps
better
drops
less
is
of
larger
size
equal
in
quality
and
will
bring
as
high
a
price
where
known
as
the
jonathan
in
a
commercial
orchard
there
should
be
few
if
any
fall
or
summer
varieties
unless
favorably
located
they
should
be
of
the
best
shipping
and
market
varieties
as
early
ripe
duchess
of
oldenburg
orange
pippin
early
white
jefferis
muster
and
watson
these
are
all
early
bearers
very
productive
and
salable
and
of
fine
quality
for
table
or
kitchen
those
best
for
a
family
orchard
are
stayman
winesap
jonathan
white
pippin
mason
orange
summer
extra
garretson
early
summer
pearmain
early
joe
jefferis
early
ripe

watson
muster
and
wagener
and
for
sweet
apples
there
are
none
better
than
broadwell
ramsdell
superb
baltzby
and
mountaineer
all
these
apples
are
early
bearers
productive
and
fine
for
family
use
and
we
can
not
well
discard
any
but
eight
or
ten
trees
of
summer
and
fall
varieties
together
are
enough
to
supply
the
largest
family
it
is
better
however
to
plant
one
of
each
variety
that
we
may
have
a
succession
of
fruit
throughout
the
season
also
if
one
variety
should
fail
others
might
not
it
would
require
a
very
long
list
to
name
all
we
have
tried
and
discarded
but
we
will
name
some
rawle
janet
we
reject
as
it
runs
too
small
and
cracks
badly
ben
davis
missouri
pippin
willow
twig
gano

black

are
all
productive
but
of
poor
quality
maiden

western

fulton

early
cole
quince
and
many
others
because
they
ripen
too
irregularly
and
drop
too
badly
the
white

pearmain
lawver
mcafee
and

blight
badly
and
are
not
sure
bearers
early

early

benoni
are
fine
but
too
small
primate

to
handle
cider
hay
wine
fallawater
scott
best
and
nonpareil
russet
are
productive
but
ripen
early
and
are
not
profitable
many
southern
winter
varieties
are
too
small
such
as
haley
gully
kittageskee
and
harris
few
if
any
eastern
winter
apples
are
of
any
value
here
as
northern
spy
baldwin
canada
red
swaar
sutton
beauty
and
melon
all
ripen
too
early
and
become
poor
dry
fall
apples
it
is
the
same
with
all
northern
apples
from
whatever
source
or
locality
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
we
can
find
a
winter
apple
adapted
to
kansas
that
originated
north
of
kansas
under
a
lower
mean
temperature
this
we
have
fully
demonstrated
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
early
apples
require
a
specific
amount
of
heat
to
bring
them
to
maturity
from
the
time
the
fruit
forms
if
brought
from
a
colder
climate
to
a
warmer
one
you
hasten
its
growth
and
accelerate
its
maturity
just
in
proportion
to
the
difference
in
mean
temperature
of
the
two
localities
and
consequently
it
ripens
in
the
fall
here
i
prefer
hilltop
for
quality
keeping
and
color
and
bottom
for
size
hilltop
and
steep
bluffs
are
the
best
for
all
kinds
of
winter
apples
as
they
produce
the
richest
fruit
with
the
finest
color
and
they
keep
the
best
and
are
not
so
subject
to
injurious
pests
fifty
feet
of
abrupt
elevation
is
equal
in
its
effect
to
fifty
miles
of
latitude
south
on
frosty
nights
it
retards
spring
growth
as
much
as
forty
miles
north
an
elevation
of
feet
makes
a
difference
of
from
ten
to
per
cent
in
the
amount
of
saccharine
matter
in
fruit
to
which
rich
quality
fine
flavor
and
aroma
are
due
bottom
land
produces
the
largest
apples
more
murky
in
color
and
more
irregular
in
bearing
rolling
intermediate
kansas
land
will
prove
satisfactory
east
and
south
slopes
hasten
the
maturity
of
fruit
and
are
the
best
for
early
varieties
a
northern
slope
retards
the
ripening
of
fruit
and
is
the
best
for
winter
apples
the
best
specimens
of
apples
we
ever
saw
in
kansas
grew
on
a
northern
bench
about
thirty
feet
below
the
top
of
an
elevation
of
feet
on
good
rich
soil
they
were
large
in
size
clear
in
color
and
perfect
in
form
we
prefer
any
good
soil
that
will
produce
a
good
corn
crop
with
a
clay
subsoil
mucky
wet
or
soils
are
not
fit
for
fruit
land
that
produces
a
good
crop
of
wheat
is
rich
enough
we
have
seen
a
very
heavy
crop
of
york
imperial
at
its
native
home
on
quite
thin
freestone
land
almost
any
of
the
land
in
leavenworth
county
is
naturally
rich
enough
if
we
only
keep
it
so
i
prefer
untrimmed
trees
set
in
furrows
made
with
a
plow
no
deeper
than
we
plant
the
trees
but
wide
enough
to
take
in
the
roots
we
set
them
about
two
inches
deeper
than
they
stood
in
the
nursery
on
the
solid
subsoil
and
pack
the
dirt
firmly
amongst
the
roots
lean
or
set
the
heaviest
top
to
the
southwest
the
largest
and
heaviest
roots
if
convenient
should
be
in
the
same
direction
after
filling
the
hole
bank
up
a
steep
mound
of
earth
around
the
tree
if
this
is
properly
done
no
ordinary
wind
will
ever
move
it
we
prefer
or
strong
trees
because
they
can
be
set
more
rapidly
cost
less
labor
less
money
live
better
and
grow
more
stocky
we
want
them
taken
up
with
care
give
no
pruning
whatever
neither
cut
their
tops
in
to
balance
the
roots
when
planting
in
orchard
trees
that
are
taken
up
when
young
and
set
out
in
an
open
orchard
without
pruning
grow
stronger
and
more
stocky
bear
sooner
and
are
less
subject
to
blight
and
the
attack
of
flathead
and
roundhead
borers
we
have
as
many
as
in
one
season
on
sections
of
roots
from
two
to
six
inches
long
with
scions
from
three
to
twenty
inches
long
to
see
which
were
the
best
sections
from
roots
grafted
with
scions
about
six
inches
long
set
deep
enough
to
form
roots
on
the
stock
are
best
this
graft
is
simply
a
it
is
the
strength
and
vigor
of
seedling
roots
not
the
length
of
them
that
make
the
trees
no
sensible
man
will
pretend
to
graft
whole
seedlings
roots
and
set
them
out
in
a
nursery
it
can
not
be
done
with
success
we
must
cut
off
a
portion
of
the
root
to
do
it
the
question
arises
how
much
it
is
then
not
a
whole
root
and
it
becomes
a
question
what
length
of
root
is
best
it
is
not
advisable
to
bud
or
graft
seedling
trees
in
the
nursery
for
all
seedlings
are
not
of
the
same
vigor
and
hardiness
consequently
the
trees
would
differ
similarly
i
plant
my
orchard
to
corn
potatoes
and
small
fruits
and
keep
this
up
with
clean
cultivation
using
a
planet
horse
hoe
until
they
begin
to
bear
and
cease
cropping
after
ten
years
planting
nothing
unless
the
crops
or
clover
in
a
bearing
orchard
windbreaks
are
injurious
unless
planted
at
least
feet
from
the
orchard
the
best
protection
is
to
plant
the
two
outer
rows
of
close
together
they
can
be
cut
out
if
desired
when
they
become
too
thick
this
is
better
than
shelter
trees
or
evergreens
we
want
a
free
circulation
of
air
to
pass
among
the
trees
a
high
and
heavy
protection
produces
an
eddy
which
blights
and
the
trees
as
well
as
hastens
the
ripening
and
dropping
of
apples
we
have
had
no
occasion
to
use
any
protection
from
rabbits
and
borers
since
we
quit
pruning
off
the
lower
limbs
pruning
is
not
thoroughly
understood
trees
are
pruned
to
make
them
live
grow
fast
and
stocky
and
also
slender
to
make
them
bear
young
give
form
light
and
air
and
to
make
them
look
alike
to
bear
heavy
crops
and
fine
specimens
it
is
claimed
all
this
can
be
done
by
pruning
it
can
be
accomplished
without
pruning
in
a
much
shorter
time
and
without
extra
labor
we
do
not
recommend
pruning
apple
trees
at
any
times
excepting
the
trees
are
well
established
in
the
orchard
then
the
lower
limbs
be
gradually
removed
to
form
the
head
about
two
feet
from
the
ground
but
the
longer
we
allow
them
to
remain
the
heavier
and
stockier
they
become
for
the
body
of
the
tree
increases
in
size
just
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
foliage
on
the
lower
limbs
we
prune
off
dead
broken
and
sucker
limbs
and
have
no
objections
to
taking
off
limbs
that
chafe
each
other
if
this
should
happen
from
neglect
we
have
lost
more
trees
from
pruning
than
from
all
other
causes
together
we
have
seen
large
orchards
just
in
their
prime
that
have
been
so
injured
from
pruning
that
they
never
recovered
on
the
other
hand
i
have
seen
orchards
that
were
so
neglected
dilapidated
and
crowded
that
i
thought
a
thorough
pruning
would
make
them
more
productive
i
never
thin
the
fruit
on
the
trees
it
is
not
necessary
pollination
is
no
doubt
an
important
factor
in
productiveness
size
quality
and
form
we
have
had
no
opportunity
to
test
the
result
with
apples
as
our
varieties
are
all
mixed
up
together
we
would
not
plant
in
an
orchard
large
blocks
of
any
variety
excessively
better
have
them
intermixed
with
other
varieties
that
bloom
at
the
same
time
the
pollen
of
one
variety
may
be
congenial
to
some
while
it
may
be
neglected
repelled
by
another
we
will
have
to
learn
this
by
experience
or
plant
a
less
number
of
varieties
together
we
have
little
experience
yet
in
planting
large
orchards
of
few
kinds
perhaps
none
of
these
varieties
that
are
esteemed
so
highly
are
congenial
to
each
other
we
had
better
go
slow
about
planting
out
to
of
one
kind
together
we
may
have
gone
too
far
now
we
do
not
use
any
fertilizer
for
our
trees
only
as
we
crop
the
land
the
virgin
soil
of
our
county
does
not
need
fertilizing
if
planted
in
orchard
until
the
tree
comes
into
bearing
except
we
crop
the
land
it
is
however
a
mistake
to
think
we
can
grow
an
orchard
and
crop
the
ground
at
the
same
time
without
any
injury
to
the
orchard
unless
we
restore
the
lost
fertility
in
some
way
orchards
so
exhaust
the
soil
in
about
sixteen
years
cropping
that
it
is
worth
little
afterwards
it
is
estimated
that
an
acre
of
apples
in
good
bearing
removes
annually
about
pounds
of
nitrogen
pounds
of
phosphoric
acid
and
pounds
of
potash
if
the
fertility
and
productiveness
of
the
orchard
is
to
be
kept
up
these
fertilizing
elements
must
be
returned
in
some
form
at
the
market
value
of
these
fertilizing
materials
it
amounts
annually
to
about
twelve
dollars
an
acre
it
is
estimated
that
an
orchard
will
be
in
full
bearing
in
about
ten
years
then
in
six
years
of
full
bearing
it
will
have
exhausted
the
soil
to
the
amount
of
dollars
per
acre
take
in
consideration
the
previous
cropping
of
ten
years
need
we
wonder
what
is
the
matter
with
our
orchard
should
we
diminish
the
feed
of
a
vigorous
horse
annually
for
ten
years
do
you
think
he
could
pull
the
same
load
or
be
of
much
value
the
nitrogen
is
the
most
expensive
element
representing
about
half
of
the
whole
yet
it
can
be
restored
to
the
soil
by
crimson
or
red
clover
peas
vetches
beans
or
turnips
which
have
the
ability
of
converting
the
free
nitrogen
of
the
air
into
available
plant
food
the
best
method
of
accomplishing
this
end
is
to
grow
these
crops
on
the
land
and
plow
them
under
in
their
green
state
at
about
maturity
i
do
not
pasture
my
orchard
it
is
not
advisable
and
does
not
pay
my
apples
are
troubled
with
i
do
not
spray
for
borers
i
bank
the
trees
so
that
if
they
deposit
their
eggs
they
can
be
gotten
out
easily
i
pick
my
apples
in
baskets
and
sacks
from
a
ladder
and
sort
them
into
three
classes
first
second
and
culls
i
pack
in
baskets
and
barrels
press
them
in
barrels
and
mark
with
name
of
variety
i
wholesale
my
apples
in
the
orchard
to
dealers
market
the
best
in
baskets
and
barrels
sell
my
second
and
third
grades
the
best
way
i
can
and
throw
the
culls
away
my
best
market
is
at
home
i
never
tried
distant
markets
and
do
not
dry
any
i
am
successful
in
storing
apples
for
winter
in
boxes
and
barrels
in
a
cellar
and
find
ben
davis
stayman
willow
twig
and
york
imperial
keep
best
in
storing
apples
for
winter
they
should
be
picked
before
they
are
too
ripe
and
when
the
weather
is
not
too
hot
when
picked
they
should
be
taken
at
once
to
shade
and
packed
and
stored
away
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
they
should
be
well
sorted
packed
in
tight
barrels
and
headed
up
to
exclude
the
light
and
air
they
will
keep
longer
if
each
apple
is
wrapped
with
paper
the
temperature
of
your
cave
or
cellar
should
be
reduced
as
much
as
possible
by
throwing
the
doors
open
at
night
and
closing
them
through
the
day
a
gradual
reduction
and
a
regular
temperature
is
better
than
a
sudden
change
apples
should
not
be
hauled
about
in
the
hot
sun
before
storing
them
away
neither
should
they
be
placed
in
cold
storage
at
once
the
change
is
too
sudden
it
is
the
same
in
taking
them
out
of
cold
storage
it
should
not
be
done
at
once
a
storing
room
for
this
purpose
should
be
provided
in
every
plant
i
do
not
have
to
repack
stored
apples
if
they
are
sold
early
but
if
not
until
late
we
have
to
repack
the
loss
depends
upon
the
variety
i
have
tried
irrigation
on
a
small
scale
but
do
not
irrigate
now
prices
have
been
from
fifty
cents
to
two
dollars
per
barrel
i
employ
men
that
are
capable
of
packing
apples
paying
from
five
to
ten
cents
per
hour
we
seldom
hear
anything
about
fall
planting
as
if
it
was
a
settled
fact
that
the
spring
was
the
best
or
the
only
time
it
could
be
done
successfully
all
of
our
trees
for
the
last
years
have
been
transplanted
in
the
fall
excepting
the
last
three
years
they
were
set
out
in
the
spring
the
difference
is
decidedly
in
favor
of
fall
planting
they
start
in
growth
earlier
and
make
a
much
stronger
growth
the
first
season
and
there
is
a
gain
of
nearly
a
year
in
size
over
those
planted
in
the
spring
and
they
certainly
have
lived
better
why
should
they
not
do
better
we
have
more
time
and
less
hurry
to
do
the
work
well
the
ground
is
in
better
condition
the
trees
have
more
time
to
callus
and
become
firmly
established
it
is
often
too
wet
to
take
the
trees
up
and
transplant
them
early
and
late
setting
is
not
advisable
the
distance
trees
should
be
set
apart
is
a
more
important
matter
than
is
generally
supposed
very
few
ever
think
how
large
a
tree
will
grow
and
the
space
it
will
occupy
almost
every
thrifty
variety
will
grow
and
spread
and
require
a
foot
of
space
each
year
that
would
be
ten
feet
in
ten
years
and
forty
feet
in
forty
years
in
other
words
the
trees
will
meet
in
forty
years
if
set
forty
feet
apart
this
holds
good
in
kansas
consequently
forty
feet
apart
is
too
close
to
plant
trees
if
we
expect
an
orchard
to
last
that
long
apple
trees
will
bear
and
be
profitable
for
that
length
of
time
if
they
have
sufficient
space
receive
proper
care
and
cultivation
and
the
fertility
of
the
soil
is
not
allowed
to
become
exhausted
many
set
their
trees
feet
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
large
crop
when
the
trees
first
come
into
bearing
with
the
intention
of
cutting
out
every
other
row
when
they
crowd
but
we
fear
very
few
if
any
ever
think
this
will
have
to
be
done
in
fifteen
years
from
the
setting
or
the
orchard
would
be
ruined
and
the
land
very
much
impoverished
it
would
be
much
better
and
more
profitable
to
set
the
trees
feet
and
cut
every
other
row
out
in
years
at
least
one
way
and
if
they
crowded
both
ways
and
not
crop
the
land
at
all
except
to
keep
up
the
fertility
of
the
soil
by
this
method
we
could
have
a
good
bearing
orchard
for
forty
years
or
longer
which
would
pay
better
than
closer
planting
and
cropping
the
land
to
pay
the
expenses

i
believe
in
thorough

as
long
as

lives
sometimes
the

requires
a
certain
kind
of

at

times
a
different
cultivation
in

orchard
i
usually
grow
corn
potatoes
wheat

i
usually

nothing

sometimes
i
take

i
cease

windbreaks

they
make

kept
thoroughly

thorough

of

it

beneficial
if
carefully
done
a
little
every

will
pay

many
things
are
to
be
well
considered
that
injunction
of
davy
crockett
must
be
kept
constantly
in
view
to
be
successful
be
sure
you
right
then
go
ahead
first
to
select
varieties
that
are
well
adapted
to
your
soil
next
location
last
but
not
least
the
preparation
of
the
soil
and
future
care
many
of
the
varieties
that
are
well
adapted
to
the
eastern
states
are
unprofitable
here
another
great
mistake
is
the
planting
of
too
many
varieties
when
i
first
came
to
this
state
thirty
years
ago
i
consulted
johnson
now
of
topeka
from
him
i
obtained
a
great
deal
of
valuable
information
he
having
had
years
of
kansas
experience
i
should
no
doubt
have
planted
many
that
i
did
not
owing
to
the
information
obtained
of
him
so
it
may
be
seen
that
by
proper
care
experience
and
observation
we
may
be
of
benefit
to
the
rising
generation
having
selected
your
varieties
by
consulting
the
published
fruit
list
of
the
kansas
state
horticultural
society
next
select
your
location
select
if
you
can
the
highest
northern
slope
next
east
next
west
put
your
ground
in
good
order
by
plowing
and
subsoiling
at
least
fifteen
inches
deep
should
there
be
any
tenacious
soil
or
spouty
places
tile
with
tile
forty
feet
apart
three
feet
deep
a
great
mistake
is
made
by
many
in
planting
too
closely
i
have
trees
years
old
forty
feet
from
tip
to
tip
plant
to
some
cultivated
crop
for
six
years
then
seed
to
clover
trim
your
trees
each
february
keep
the
borers
out
and
if
they
do
get
into
your
trees
hunt
them
out
spray
your
trees
frequently
at
the
proper
time
to
prevent
the
noxious
insects
from
getting
the
start
of
you
and
when
your
trees
commence
to
bear
commence
to
fertilize
by
turning
under
clover
and
stable
litter
horace
greeley
once
said
you
might
as
well
expect
milk
from
a
cow
tied
to
a
stake
as
apples
from
an
orchard
uncared
for
munger
hollis
cloud
county
i
have
lived
in
kansas
fifteen
years
have
an
apple
orchard
of
trees
twelve
inches
in
diameter
eighteen
feet
high
seventeen
years
old
i
prefer
for
market
ben
davis
missouri
pippin
and
to
a
limited
extent
yellow
transparent
and
grimes
golden
pippin
and
for
a
family
orchard
add
early
harvest
and
maiden
blush
have
tried
and
discarded
the
willow
twig
on
account
of
blight
and
rot
i
prefer
bottom
land
with
a
loose
subsoil
and
young
and
stocky
trees
i
plant
my
orchard
to
potatoes
beans
and
vines
for
ten
years
and
use
a
cultivator
that
keeps
three
inches
very
mellow
and
cease
cropping
when
impossible
to
cultivate
i
grow
weeds
in
the
orchard
and
mow
them
windbreaks
are
not
essential
but
are
very
desirable
would
make
them
of
osage
orange
russian
mulberries
or
set
the
first
row
four
feet
apart
the
second
six
inches
and
never
trim
the
third
six
feet
for
rabbits
i
use
traps
and
gun
i
hunt
the
borers
and
encourage
the
birds
i
prune
my
trees
so
as
to
give
air
and
sunshine
think
it
pays
do
not
thin
the
fruit
while
on
the
trees
my
apples
are
in
mixed
plantings
i
fertilize
my
orchard
in
the
winter
with
stable
litter
fresh
from
the
stable
it
appears
to
do
good
and
would
advise
its
use
with
judgment
on
all
soils
i
pasture
my
orchard
with
hogs
and
calves
i
do
not
think
it
advisable
among
young
trees
my
trees
are
troubled
with
and
my
fruit
with
i
spray
just
after
the
blossom
falls
with
paris
green
for
the
prices
have
been
from
cents
to
per
bushel
what
the
future
of
in
northern
central
kansas
may
be
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
tell
but
from
the
success
of
the
few
orchards
that
have
been
planted
and
after
being
planted
have
received
some
attention
besides
that
bestowed
by
calves
and
pigs
it
would
seem
well
worth
a
trial
there
are
years
when
the
best
attention
possible
can
not
prevent
damage
and
some
loss
from
drought
especially
on
upland
for
this
reason
bottom
land
would
seem
more
suitable
for
an
orchard
in
this
county
even
though
subject
to
some
disadvantages
in
some
orchards
on
low
land
only
a
few
feet
above
the
where
a
sandy
subsoil
admits
of
a
free
natural
subirrigation
the
thrift
and
productiveness
of
the
trees
have
been
unusually
good
cold
seems
to
be
dreaded
less
than
hot
dry
weather
in
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
although
late
spring
frosts
sometimes
do
damage
even
the
traditional
north
slope
might
have
its
advantages
somewhat
balanced
in
this
county
by
the
valley
lands
that
retain
a
large
amount
of
moisture
a
good
soil
with
a
loose
subsoil
that
holds
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
water
are
the
most
important
requirements
as
to
location
if
the
cultivation
is
then
such
as
to
save
the
water
of
early
summer
rains
to
the
best
advantage
until
the
dry
weather
of
the
late
summer
comes
it
will
be
drawn
upon
and
some
very
dry
seasons
may
be
tided
over
without
much
loss
plowing
in
the
spring
and
very
frequent
shallow
cultivation
afterwards
are
as
yet
the
best
known
means
to
this
end
and
as
a
general
rule
they
are
sufficient
to
answer
every
purpose
as
far
west
as
central
kansas
without
artificial
watering
as
the
average
rainfall
shows
but
if
the
early
rains
are
allowed
to
go
to
waste
by
falling
on
the
hard
ground
and
running
directly
off
or
by
rapid
evaporation
from
an
undisturbed
surface
where
capillary
force
is
rapidly
carrying
back
to
the
surface
what
has
already
soaked
in
we
invite
ultimate
failure
when
the
drought
comes
cultivate
once
a
week
or
after
each
rain
when
they
come
oftener
than
that
with
something
that
will
keep
two
or
three
inches
of
very
fine
mellow
earth
on
the
surface
and
will
cause
an
amount
of
water
to
be
retained
in
the
soil
below
the
earth
mulch
that
will
surprise
any
one
who
has
never
tried
it
an
ordinary
harrow
will
do
very
well
or
better
a
cultivator
behind
which
i
fasten
a
scantling
with
large
wire
nails
driven
through
it
about
two
inches
apart
weighted
on
the
back
edge
to
keep
it
right
side
up
the
scantling
is
cut
as
long
as
the
width
of
the
cultivator
at
one
operation
the
cultivator
and
this
harrow
leave
the
ground
about
like
a
would
marked
only
by
the
footprints
of
the
driver
last
summer
this
was
used
several
times
where
young
peach
trees
had
been
set
out
going
around
each
row
and
sometimes
over
the
entire
ground
there
was
no
time
during
the
summer
that
the
trees
stopped
growing
or
showed
signs
of
needing
more
moisture
than
they
had
nine
hundred
and
lived
the
horses
killed
two
and
the
borers
two
more
fifteen
years
ago
i
bought
a
small
farm
having
on
it
a
small
family
orchard
of
apple
trees
it
included
several
varieties
from
summer
to
winter
sorts
the
trees
were
feet
apart
with
peach
trees
alternating
both
ways
making
three
times
as
many
peaches
as
apples
in
the
orchard
the
land
was
cultivated
until
the
trees
were
ten
years
old
then
sowed
to
timothy
and
clover
the
timothy
soon
died
out
but
the
clover
lived
for
a
few
years
but
is
gone
now
it
happened
that
some
of
the
years
that
it
was
not
cultivated
were
some
of
the
driest
during
the
fifteen
and
several
trees
died
of
blight
would
this
have
happened
if
the
cultivation
had
been
continued
i
have
gone
to
plowing
and
cultivating
again
anyway
with
no
crop
in
the
orchard
the
trees
are
now
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
high
and
about
twelve
inches
in
diameter
at
the
ground
the
peach
trees
have
mostly
been
cut
out
can
not
see
that
they
did
any
harm
unless
it
might
have
been
harder
on
the
apple
trees
during
the
dry
season
but
if
it
was
the
peaches
were
worth
about
as
much
as
the
apples
and
the
trees
make
a
quick
bushy
growth
thus
forming
a
shelter
for
the
apple
trees
which
now
stand
straight
and
are
well
balanced
we
have
had
a
peach
crop
about
half
of
the
years
potatoes
beans
and
vine
crops
were
raised
in
the
orchard
the
first
few
years
it
was
surrounded
by
a
windbreak
of
cottonwood
and
trees
several
rows
seven
feet
apart
each
way
this
is
certainly
very
beneficial
but
russian
mulberries
grow
as
well
make
a
thicker
top
and
at
the
same
time
invite
birds
to
keep
up
their
quarters
there
and
make
their
homes
with
us
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
osage
orange
planted
the
same
as
for
a
hedge
and
never
cut
back
will
make
a
better
windbreak
than
cottonwood
or
and
a
fence
at
the
same
time
this
orchard
has
borne
variable
crops
some
good
some
light
but
always
fruits
it
is
on
bottom
land
sloping
very
slightly
to
the
southeast
soil
a
sandy
loam
with
a
clay
subsoil
it
has
been
pruned
considerably
but
not
very
much
at
a
time
one
man
in
this
county
who
succeeds
well
with
apples
never
prunes
except
to
keep
the
center
open
to
sun
and
air
another
near
him
gave
his
orchard
a
severe
trimming
a
few
years
ago
and
had
no
fruit
but
some
dead
trees
for
two
or
three
years
afterward
in
planting
the
ground
should
be
well
plowed
then
mark
off
one
way
with
a
plow
or
lister
twice
to
the
row
with
the
lister
with
three
or
four
horses
and
the
subsoiler
well
down
will
make
a
very
good
preparation
for
small
trees
without
much
digging
and
small
trees
are
best
for
several
reasons
they
are
cheaper
less
work
to
set
out
and
more
likely
to
live
set
stakes
to
go
by
and
in
planting
cross
the
furrows
we
have
just
finished
setting
peach
trees
in
this
way
and
very
little
digging
was
needed
then
cultivate
well
and
often
rub
off
shoots
that
start
where
limbs
are
not
wanted
and
start
an
evenly
balanced
top
of
four
or
five
limbs
a
year
after
the
trees
are
set
out
if
any
of
them
are
leaning
much
dig
away
the
dirt
on
the
side
from
which
they
lean
and
set
them
up
straight
tramping
the
dirt
well
on
the
opposite
side
with
winter
will
come
the
rabbits
and
they
will
girdle
the
trees
if
not
prevented
many
and
varied
are
the
sure
cures
for
them
but
none
are
perfect
a
wash
of
ordinary
whitewash
and
a
pint
of
sulphur
to
the
bucketful
applied
with
a
brush
or
swab
to
the
bodies
of
the
trees
generally
stops
their
work
but
if
the
rain
washes
it
off
it
must
be
put
on
again
or
they
will
resume
operations
a
little
added
to
the
whitewash
prevents
the
rain
from
having
so
much
effect
on
it
make
it
thin
so
it
will
not
scale
off
so
badly
two
applications
have
been
enough
for
our
young
trees
the
past
winter
we
also
use
traps
which
are
very
similar
to
the
wellhouse
traps
described
in
the
kansas
state
horticultural
report
for
tarred
paper
veneering
screen
wire
cloth
tied
around
the
trees
or
a
fence
around
the
entire
orchard
are
all
among
the
practical
means
used
to
fence
against
rabbits
but
do
try
the
plan
of
one
of
my
neighbors
unless
you
have
too
many
trees
he
applied
it
kept
the
rabbits
off
and
his
orchard
is
now
a
treeless
during
winter
we
haul
manure
direct
from
the
stable
and
spread
under
the
trees
not
against
them
out
as
far
as
the
ends
of
the
limbs
on
good
ground
i
would
not
do
much
of
this
until
the
trees
get
to
bearing
as
it
would
interfere
somewhat
with
cultivation
and
would
not
be
needed
but
when
a
good
annual
crop
is
taken
from
the
orchard
something
must
be
returned
or
the
supply
is
going
to
run
out
on
thin
land
rotten
manure
applied
when
the
trees
are
small
will
do
them
good
pasturing
an
orchard
at
any
time
is
of
doubtful
expediency
it
is
safer
not
to
i
have
sprayed
but
once
that
was
done
just
after
the
blossoms
fell
and
again
ten
days
later
there
were
fewer
wormy
apples
than
usual
that
was
last
year
think
i
will
try
it
further

apart
alternated
with
peaches
i
have
cultivated
my
orchard
to
corn
but
do
not
think
it
advisable
i
used
a
plow
cultivator
and
disc
for
eight
years
i
have
cultivated
the
young
orchard
both
ways
twelve
times
and
shall
keep
on
with
the

and
harrow
i
cease
cropping
after
six

eight
years
and
then
grow
alfalfa
windbreaks
are
not
essential
i
use
as
a
protection
against
rabbits
i
would
not
risk
an
apple
or
pear
tree
without
it
i
prune
with
a
knife
saw
and
shears
when
the
trees
are
young
i
think
it
beneficial
as
it
makes
the
trees
healthier
i
fertilize
my
orchard
with
stable
litter
i
spread
it
all
over
the
ground
and
then
harrow
it
in
i
pasture
my
orchard
with
calves
after
it
is
six
or
eight
years
old
and
has
been
seeded
to
grass
i
think
it
pays
in
an
old
orchard
my
trees
are
troubled
with
and
borers
i
have
not
sprayed
yet
but
think
i
shall
this
spring
with
bordeaux
mixture
i
pick
my
apples
by
hand
sort
into
two
classes
i
feed
my
second

third
grades
and
culls
to
the

and
hogs
have
made
cider
of
them
but
could
not
find
market
for
it
i
have
tried
shipping
apples
to
distant
markets
but
it
did
not
pay
i
dry
some
apples
for
home
use
using
stove
and
sun
neither
way
is
satisfactory
i
store
my
best
apples
in
bulk
in
a
cellar
under
the
house
am
not
very
successful
i
find
ben
davis

keep
the
best

have
been
from

windbreaks
are

a

fence
is
all
that

oats
after
that
i
think
windbreaks
are
essential
and
would
make
them
of
native
timber
planted
south
of
the

i
prune
with
a

and

and
believe
it
makes
the

larger
and
better
i
never
thin
on

i
like
to
put
plenty
of

litter
and
old
straw
at
the
roots
of
the

in

i
pasture
with
hogs
after
the
oats
come
up
they
eat
all
the

and
thus
destroy

never
tried

believe

would
be

fertilizers
make
the
trees
thriftier
but
cause
the
roots
to
run
nearer
the
surface
consequently
the
trees
suffer
more
in
drought
i
have
pastured

with

hogs
injure

the
worst

i
have
are
the

which

cut
out

the

have
never
sprayed

think
i
will
we
pick
from

into

and
sort
into
two

we
pick
the
best
from

and
shake
the
others
to

i
sometimes
sell
in

i

when
i
can
but
sell
more

an

of

of
these

twenty

seventeen

ten

seven

two

i

winesap

for

use
i
add
missouri
pippin
snow
and
early
harvest
winesap
best
of
all
i
prefer
hilltop
as
the
gophers
are
bad
on
the
bottom
i
prefer
a
black
soil
with
lots
of
gravel
and
small
stones
in
it
believe
that
north
and
east
slopes
are
best
i
plant
trees
with
short
bodies
feet
apart
each
way
i
cultivate
with
corn
for
about
ten
years
using
the
stirring
plow
and
cultivator
i
believe
windbreaks
are
essential
and
would
use
four
rows
of
cherry
trees
set
close
together
or
a
row
of
hedge
or
mainly
on
the
south
some
on
the
north
for
protection
from
rabbits
i
tie
around
the
trees
and
keep
them
on
for
three
or
four
years
winter
and
summer
i
prune
some
with
the
and
saw
i
do
not
thin
the
fruit
unless
i
think
the
limbs
are
going
to
break
i
would
use
no
fertilizer
unless
the
soil
is
very
poor
never
pasture
the
orchard
i
sprayed
one
year
with
london
purple
using
a
barrel
with
a
pump
in
it
i
could
not
see
that
it
did
any
good
so
i
let
them
go
i
pick
in
buckets
from
a
people
come
from
the
west
with
wagons
and
take
the
apples
right
out
of
the
orchard
and
they
do
sort
much
i
make
some
culls
into
cider
and
let
the
rest
lay
under
the
trees
and
rot
the
price
last
year
was
cents
per
bushel
and
the
year
before
cents
i
store
a
few
for
winter
in
thin
layers
one
above
another
in
a
rack
in
the
cellar
and
am
successful
winesaps
keep
the
best
for
picking
i
use
good
careful
men
at
one

godfrey
fine
maxson
osage
county
have
lived
in

years
i
have
trees
planted
five
ten
and
years
for

i
use
missouri
pippin
and
ben
davis
for
family
use
i
plant
early
harvest
maiden
blush
lowell
and
jonathan
for
summer
and
missouri
pippin
and
winesap
for

if
i
were
putting
out
now
i
would
only
plant
missouri
pippin
and
winesap
i
prefer
bottom
and
such
soil
as
has
formerly
been
brush
and
timber
land
a
part
of
my
orchard
slopes
a
little
to
the
south
i
plant
thrifty
with
the
top
leaning
to
the
southwest
i
cultivate
until
they
begin
bearing
the
plow
is
as
good
a
tool
as
any
but
care
must
be
taken
not
to
injure
the
roots
the
best
crop
is
buckwheat
or
potatoes
i
have
had
strawberries
and
blackberries
in
the
orchard
but
do
not
consider
it
best
i
cease
cropping
after
they
come
into
bearing
i
believe
in
windbreaks
i
do
not
know
what
would
be
best
mine
is
protected
by
natural
and
hedge
to
protect
from
borers
i
use
a
wash
with
lye
or
strong
i
tie
around
young
trees
to
protect
from
rabbits
i
believe
it
pays
to
prune
with
the
saw
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
fruit
i
think
stable
litter
is
good
for
old
orchards
but
should
not
be
put
close
up
around
the
body
of
the
tree
i
should
pasture
very
little
as
stock
of
all
kinds
destroy
the
trees
and
injure
the
fruit
i
have
sprayed
little
but
can
not
say
much
about
it
i
pick
by
hand
and
do
not
pack
at
all
as
those
that
i
do
not
find
a
market
for
here
at
home
i
sell
to
shippers
i
sell
many
in
the
orchard
and
when
there
is
a
full
crop
i
sell
to
shippers
and
they
grade
and
mark
them
i
sell
culls
for
cider
when
there
is
a
call
for
them
i
tried
drying
but
did
not
find
it
profitable
i
do
not
store
any
apples
for
winter
as
i
have
no
good
place
prices
per
bushel
have
ranged
from
to
cents
i
use
men
for
help
and
pay

the

then
every

for

it

very
fine
siberian
crabs
hyslop
transparent

whitney
they
were
affected
with
blight
nearly
all
of
the
siberian
trees
were
dead
from
the
effects
of
it
and
one
day
while
in
the
orchard
watching
the
movements
of
the
birds
and
boys
i
saw
a
striped
woodpecker
fly
to
one
of
the
trees
and
he
found
what
he
supposed
to
be
a
grub
but
when
he
got
through
the
bark
he
was
very
much
disappointed
wiped
his
bill
and
flew
to
another
tree
where
he
continued
to
wipe
and
clean
his
bill
so
i
went
to
the
tree
mentioned
and
found
the
bark
very
loose
and
sour
where
he
had
punctured
it
i
compared
the
smell
and
taste
with
the
blighted
twigs
and
found
them
the
same
i
cut
the
bark
that
was
loose
from
the
tree
and
found
the
rapid
growth
of
the
bark
and
the
flow
of
the
sap
had
bursted
the
bark
from
the
wood
and
this
sap
had
soured
and
been
taken
up
by
the
other
sap
and
poisoned
the
ends
of
the
new
growth
hence
it
blighted
it
was
sap
poison
like

poison
i
then
used
the
knife
freely
splitting
the
body
and
limbs
i
saved
twenty
out
of
of
the
trees
i
then
went
over
the
orchard
and
cured
all
the
trees
in
one
season
never
been
bothered

the
woodpecker
taught
me
a
lesson

advise
it
on

soils
as
i
think
too
much
straw
mulching
is
an
injury
to
the
trees
when
they
get
old
i
do
not

my

it
does
not

my
trees
were
troubled

last

i

i
have
lived
in
kansas
years
have
an
apple
orchard
of
six
acres
old
enough
to
be
at

best
for
market
i
prefer
ben

pippin
jonathan

and
for
family
use
early
harvest
red
june
maiden

and
missouri
pippin
i
prefer
a
low
bottom
with
a
black
loam
and
a
north
slope
i
prefer
trees
set
in
holes
large
enough
to
receive
them
by
feet
i
cultivate
my
young
orchard
to
corn
and
potatoes
using
a
disc
harrow
and
cease
cropping
when
they
begin
to
bear
i
plant
nothing
in
a
bearing
orchard
windbreaks
would
be
beneficial
on
the
south
to
protect
the
orchard
from
the
hot
south
winds
i
would
make
it
of
walnut
trees
because
they
sap
the
ground
the
least
to
protect
them
from
the
borers
i
leave
the
branches
low
down
and
when
we
see
any
sawdust
i
dig
him
out
with
a
knife
i
prune
very
little
with
knife
and
saw
to
balance
the
trees
i
do
not
thin
the
fruit
on
the
trees
some
say
if
you
expect
to
get
a
load
of
apples
from
a
tree
you
must
give
it
a
load
of
manure
every
time
it
bears
and
i
think
this
is
right
but
do
put
it
too
close
to
the
tree
i
pasture
my
orchard
with
nothing
but
poultry
it
is
not
advisable
it
makes
the
ground
too
hard
troubles
my
apples
very
much
i
do
not
spray
i
sell
apples
in
the
orchard
peddle
the
best
ones
make
cider
and
vinegar
of
the
culls
do
dry
any
for

just
enough
for

use
prices
have
been
from
forty

dickinson

i
have
lived
in

nineteen
years
have
an

ten

eighteen
years

for
commercial
orchard
i
prefer
ben

i

stout
trees
planted
sixteen
or
eighteen
feet
east

west
and
thirty
or
feet
north

i
think
an
orchard
ought
to
have
as
much
cultivation
as
a
i
grow
early
corn
in
my
young
orchard
using
an
acme
and
cutaway
harrow
and
cultivate
as
for
corn
i
cease
cropping
when
fairly
bearing
plant
nothing
in
a
bearing
orchard
unless
for
fertilizing
but
keep
cultivating
windbreaks
are
essential
would
make
them
of
evergreen
osage
orange
maples
cottonwood
etc
for

i
rub
the
trees
with
axle
grease
or
tar
and
fish
oil
or
old

mixed
apply
with
a
cloth
for
borers
i
wash
with
lye

strong
i
prune
my
trees
severely
when
planting
and
watch
them
for
several
years
and
cut
out
all
branches
that
rub
or
crowd
and
cut
out
buds
so
that
the
tree
will
not
have
too
many
limbs
for
foundation
i
think
it
pays
i
thin
the
fruit
while
on
the
trees
begin
early
when
the
trees
are
full
and
continue
all
through
the
season
whenever
i
see
imperfect
fruit
think
it
pays
big
my
trees
are
mixed
plantings
i
fertilize
my
orchard
with
stable
litter
and
wood
ashes
i
would
especially
advise
the
use
of
wood
ashes
i
pasture
my
orchard
very
little
would
put
hogs
in
if
the
limbs
were
not
too
low
and
full
of
apples
i
think
it
would
pay
my
trees
are
troubled
with
flathead
borer
and
and
my
apples
with
i
intend
spraying
this
year
with
paris
green
and
london
purple
for
the
worms
and
bordeaux
mixture
for
blight
and
fungous
diseases
as
soon
as
the
blossoms
fall
in
picking
i
use
foot
ladders
and
baskets
unless
the
variety
is
very
hard
then
i
use
sacks
sort
into
three
classes
pack
in
barrels
shaken
and
pressed
down
then
headed
and
marked
with
name
of
variety
and
haul
to
shipping
point
on
wagon
sell
some
apples
in
the
orchard
let
the
grocer
have
the
best
to
sell
on
commission
sell
second
and
third
grades
the
best
way
i
can
make
cider
of
culls
my
best
market
is
at
abilene
never
tried
distant
markets
dry
only
for
home
use
am
successful
in
storing
apples
in
barrels
and
tight
boxes
in
a
cave
find
winesap
and
rawle
janet
keep
well
till
june
put
my
apples
in
the
cave
when
the
weather
is
cold
and
keep
it
open
cold
nights
but
am
careful
to
not
let
it
freeze
think
it
best
to
repack
stored
apples
when
kept
late
if
they
are
well
managed
you
will
not
lose
five
per
probably
not
two
per
cent
do
not
irrigate
but
would
if
i
had
water
facilities
prices
last
fall
were
from
forty
to
fifty
cents
per
bushel
in
the
orchard
but
the
apples
i
kept
over
netted
me
to
per
bushel
i
employ
men
and
women
think
women
best
and
cheapest
for
sorting
pay
fifty
sixty
and
cents
per
day
i
do
not
consider
myself
a
successful
horticulturist
but
believe
if
i
had
known
as
much
about
the
nature
or
necessity
of
the
orchard
when
we
came
to
kansas
nineteen
years
ago
as
i
do
now
i
could
have
made
a
success
of
it
even
here
in
central
kansas
i
would
especially
say
that
i
do
not
believe
there
can
be
success
with
an
orchard
exposed
on
upland
there
might
possibly
be
some
success
as
a
family
orchard
with
a
good
windbreak
planted
around
it
especially
on
the
south
side
but
i
would
not
take
ten
twenty
or
thirty
acres
of
exposed
upland
with
apple
trees
enough
to
plant
it
as
a
gift
if
i
must
plant
and
tend
it
for
the
produce
of
it
for
ten
or
more
years
i
do
not
know
of
a
single
such
orchard
that
is
worth
having
i
would
advise
selecting
low
ground
sloping
north
and
east
with
an
elevation
or
good
timber
protection
on
south
and
west
land
inclining
to
bottom
or
good
draw
my
belief
is
that
with
a
good
selection
of
varieties
and
the
proper
kind
of
land
and
location
could
be
made
quite
profitable
here
keeping
the
apples
in
cellars
is
a
mistake
a
good
cave
kept
as
cold
as
possible
without
freezing
is
far
better
i
think
apples
should
be
placed
on
the
north
side
of
some
shed
or
building
before
being
put
in
the
cave
and
kept
cool
and
put
into
cave
before
freezing
last
fall
i
sold
my
choice
apples
at
the
orchard
at
from
forty
to
fifty
cents
per
bushel
i
kept
some
in
barrels
in
the
cave
they
were
in
good
demand
later
about
the
holidays
i
got
and
since
then
i
had
a
contract
with
a
grocer
to
sell
them
for
fifteen
per
and
they
netted
me
as
above
i
have
some
in
very
fine
condition
in
my
cave
yet
april
i
still
open
the
cave
on
cold
nights

exclusively
for

purposes
the
same
can
be
done
in
kansas
but
takes
longer
to
come
to
maturity
taxes
are
low
in
missouri
the
orchardist
should
not
be
assessed
on
his
and
pay
the
penalty
for
being
energetic
and
a
pusher
in
horticulture
in
kansas
thanks
to
the
life
work
of
the
members
of
the
state
horticultural
society
we
have
reached
a
point
where
the
culture
of
fruit
is
an
assured
success
and
there
is
more
money
in
it
than
in
hog
or
corn
raising
the
trouble
has
been
too
many
worthless
varieties
have
been
planted
and
now
that
they
are
bearing
are
profitless
and
the
worst
of
it
is
they
are
repeating
the
same
mistake
each
year
i
have
saved
some
valuable
trees
from
the
borers
by
taking
a
bit
and
boring
a
hole
and
putting
in
strychnine
or
sulphur
and
the
tree
lived
on
while
all
others
died
even
in
the
black
locust
it
was
successful
i
then
plug
the
outside
portion
of
the
hole

needs
it
use

on

and
the

thin

sometimes
when

in

i
form

repeating

set
from

thirty
feet
in
the
row
have
tried
root
grafts
that
is
the
only
successful
way
to
grow
trees
here
i
cultivate
my
orchard
to
potatoes
for
the
first
two
or
three
years
after
that
to
any
kind
of
vines
i
use
a
stirring
plow
plowing
very
shallow
near
the
trees
and
deeper
near
the
center
i
grow
nothing
in
a
bearing
orchard
and
cease
cropping
after
five
years
i
think
windbreaks
are
essential
and
would
make
them
of
seedling
peach
russian
mulberry
or
any
trees
in
three
or
four
rows
on
the
south
side
of
the
orchard
i
trap
the
rabbits
and
use
my
knife
on
the
borers
am
not
troubled
with
them
very
much
i
prune
trees
while
young
to
give
the
proper
shape
to
the
top
and
later
to
remove
the
crossed
limbs
and
cause
them
to
spread
out
and
shade
the
trunk
and
as
much
space
as
possible
i
have
thinned
the
fruit
on
trees
to
a
limited
extent
it
should
be
done
when
about
the
size
of
quail
eggs
think
it
makes
little
difference
whether
trees
are
planted
in
block
or
mixed
up
i
do
not
fertilize
my
orchard
the
soil
is
rich
enough
water
is
what
it
needs
i
pasture
my
orchard
with
hogs
and
think
it
advisable
as
they
eat
all
the
wormy
fruit
and
destroy
many
insects
by
rooting
i
find
it
pays
my
trees
are
troubled
with
root
aphis
my
apples
are
bothered
by
gouger
and
blue
jays
i
spray
with
london
purple
and
lime
about
gallons
of
water
to
one
pound
of
purple
and
six
pounds
of
lime
i
think
paris
green
would
be
better
i
spray
for
as
soon
as
i
see
them
and
am
of
the
opinion
that
one
application
is
enough
but
do
not
think
spraying
of
any
use
for
as
the
moth
itself
does
not
eat
anything
but
the
honey
from
the
base
of
the
bloom
and
not
enough
of
the
poison
reaches
them
to
amount
to
anything
my
method
of
fighting
them
is
as
soon
as
the
moth
appears
in
the
spring
to
put
old
fruit
cans
in
the
trees
filled
with
sweet
water
this
attracts
the
moths
and
they
drown
in
it
i
also
burn
torches
in
the
orchard
at
night
another
way
is
to
hang
a
lantern
over
a
tub
of
water
that
has
a
little
in
it
this
will
kill
a
great
many
insects
i
my
fruit
into
sacks
slung
over
the
shoulder
i
use
a
for
those
i
can
not
reach
i
sell
apples
in
orchard
also
retail
sell
best
ones
to
best
customers
i
dry
second
and
third
grades
of
culls
i
make
cider
and
vinegar
and
feed
to
pigs
my
best
market
is
at
home
i
dry
some
apples
use
a
victor
evaporator
and
one
that
i
made
after
drying
we
heat
in
an
oven
and
put
in
double
paper
bags
and
find
a
ready
market
but
it
does
not
pay
i
store
apples
in
boxes
in
a
cellar
dug
in
solid
it
is
fifty
feet
long
five
feet
wide
and
six
and
feet
deep
with
rooms
on
each
side
it
is
perfectly
dry
and
the
temperature
even
but
it
is
too
warm
for
winter
i
find
it
is
excellent
for
summer
and
fall
apples
those
that
keep
best
are
rawle
janet
and
missouri
pippin
we
have
to
repack
stored
apples
before
marketing
i
do
not
lose
many
i
use
or
sell
as
soon
as
fit
i
irrigate
my
orchard
from
a
small
creek
fed
by
springs
i

running

with

also
provided

the
surplus
and
seepage
goes
back

below
the
main
dam
the
creek
below
the
dam
has
small
dams
in
it
to
hold
the
seepage
water
at
the
desired
height
which
serves
for
subirrigation
the
best
irrigation
in
the
world
the
water
should
not
stand
nearer
than
five
feet
of
the
surface
for
apples
i
run
the
water
between
the
rows
in
wide
shallow
ditches
any
time
from
march
to
september
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
a
creek
to
irrigate
an
orchard
a
good
big
ditch
along
the
hillside
above
the
orchard
will
catch
enough
melted
snow

rain
to
pay
for
its
construction
this
should
run

and
lister
in
the
fall
i
think
windbreaks
would
be
beneficial
on
the
south
and
would
make
them
of
buildings
and
sheds
of
all
kinds
i
am
troubled
with
small
borers
in
the
limbs
i
prune
out
the
inside
of
trees
to
let
sun
and
air
through
i
think
it
beneficial
and
that
it
pays
i
never
thin
apples
the
wind
does
the
thinning
my
trees
are
in
mixed
plantings
and
i
believe
would
bear
every
year
if
they
did
not
freeze
i
fertilize
my
orchard
with
stable
litter
on
top
of
heavy
snows
i
think
it
beneficial
if
not
too
close
to
the
trees
i
would
advise
its
use
on
all
soils
if
applied
at
the
right
time
and
in
the
right
manner
i
do
not
pasture
my
orchard
it
does
not
pay
my
trees
are
troubled
with
small
borers
and
my
fruit
with
some
insects
i
do
not
spray
i
have
used
for
borers
but
do
nothing
now

pick

have
an

seven

about

my

is
situated

set

i
plant
my

can
not

that
it

while
on

it

benefit
i
fertilize
my

it
beneficial

heavily
cropped

on

the

is
in

they
have
a
clay
subsoil
and
slope
in

would

trees
set
in
holes
dug
four
feet
deep
five
feet
wide
filled
in
the
bottom
with
soil
hauled
from
the
creek
i
cultivate
my
trees
with
a
cultivator
and
harrow
i
think
the
life
of
the
tree
depends
on
the
cultivation
and
that
we
will
have
to
keep
it
up
as
long
as
the
tree
lives
i
plant
potatoes

in

windbreaks
would

should
be
made

set

rub

on

i
commence
pruning
when
i
set
the

out
using
a
knife

saw
to
keep
the
tops
from
getting
too
heavy
and
to
give
shape
i
think
it
pays
never
have
thinned
the
fruit
while
on

trees
but
would
if
my
trees
should
ever
be
overloaded
i
think
it
would
pay
i
fertilize
my
orchard
from
the
sheep
corral
it
keeps
the
ground
moist
and
is
food
for
the
trees
would
not
advise
its
use
on
bottom
land
as
the
growth
would
be
too
rapid
i
pasture
my
orchard
with
hogs
but
do
not
think
it
advisable
it
does
not
pay
my
trees
are
troubled
with
grasshoppers
and
flathead
borers
i
dig
borers
out
in
the
spring
then
wash
the
tree
with
strong
which
i
think
eradicates
all
lice
and
insects
that
may
be
in
the
bark
of
the
tree
it
gives
the
tree
a
hearty
vigorous
growth
i
do
not
irrigate

cultivate

about

to
give
us
a

for

we
got
three
bushels
from

the
most
ever
taken
from

by

they
are
fine
keepers
and
are
said
to
be
much
better
both
in

than
those
grown
farther
east
we
have
kept
them
in
fine
condition
until
july
following
and
then
the
supply
gave
out
have
no
trees
where
they
can

hope
to
put

select
varieties
from

that
they
may
be
well
supplied
in
planting
a

i
would
study
the
wants

demands
of
the
people
also
the
varieties
best
adapted

do
not
be

catalogued
a

man
who

a

bushels
of
some
one
good
variety
of

can
always
get
the

price
for

if

consisted
of
ten

there
would
not
be
enough
of
any

to
attract

and
consequently
he
must
take
what
he
can
get
for
them
select
such
varieties
as
the
market
demands
and
then
confine
your
planting
to
as
few
varieties
as
possible
and
your

will
attract

destroy

this

and
think
it
advisable
as
it
pays
i
have
sprayed
but
never
saw
any
good
in

i
dig
the
borers
out
with
a
wire
unless
they
are
in
the
heart
of
the
tree
and
then
there
is
no
help
for

i
pick
from

and
sort
into
three
classes
windfalls
wormy
and
perfect
in
picking
we
drop
the
decayed
and
gnarly
to
the
ground
carry
the
rest
in
baskets
to
the

put
the
perfect
ones
in
one
barrel
and
the
others
in
another
do
not
disturb
the
best
ones
until
you
sell
the

should
be

again
before
you
sell
i
sell
some
in
the

but
peddle
mostly
my
best
i
sell
to
the

in

of

i
make

my
best

is
the

in

i
dry
some
satisfactorily
on
a

pack
in

sacks
and
find
a
ready

profitable
market
for

in

i
store
successfully
for

in

in

in

i
find
that
ben

a

up

here
i

in

i

in

crossing
mismatching
to

zigzag
i
will
cultivate
the
orchard
for
forty
years
in
this
county
if
they
live
so
long
i
would
grow
corn
amongst
them
for
the
first
three
or
four
years
after
that
nothing
the
less
crop
the
better
i
believe
windbreaks
are
essential
in
small
orchards
but
in
large
orchards
the
trees
will
protect
each
other
for
windbreaks
i
would
plant
maple
or
mulberry
at
least
two
rods
away
from
the
apple
trees
for
protection
against

add

green
and

it
will
never
fail
i
prune
while
the
tree
is
young
then
the
wound
does
not
affect
them
so
much
it
pays
and
is
very
necessary
i
have
never
thinned
but
think
it
necessary
just
before
the
apples
are
half
grown
i
use
no
fertilizer
whatever
i
do
not
pasture
my
orchard
much
but
when
i
do
it
is
with

and
i
think
it
advisable
when
the
fruit
is
wormy
and
falling
off
i
have
some
insects
but
have
never
sprayed
for
borers
i
use
a

the

of

to

grow
corn
or
for
five
or
six
years
leaving
a
good
space
next
the

not
for
weeds
but
to
be
well
cultivated
a
silly
policy
is
to
cultivate
the
corn
that
costs
less
than
five
cents
per
row
for
seed
four
times
and
leave
the
tree
row
that

more
uncultivated
do
not
use

it
hills
up

too
much
if
you
list
your

go
east

one

the
next

keep

well
cultivated
grow
nothing
after

not
even
weeds
or
clover
cultivate
at
right
angles
and
diagonal
whenever
you
are
blessed
with
a

rain
in

do
wait
until
the

start
but
cultivate
as
soon
as
the

it
keep
a

mulch
on
by

few
know
the
great
value
of
a
dust
mulch
for
a
family
orchard
a
cultivator
near
the
trees
and
a
cultivator
for
the
middles
will
do
use
the
harrow
often
six
days
work
at
the
proper
time
will
keep
a
orchard
in
good
shape
through
the

some
say
this
is
not
a
fruit
country
it
is
not
and
never
will
be
to
the
one
who
has
no
time
to
cultivate
but
to
the
careful
cultivator
there
is
great
reward
for
the
very
same
reason
i
believe
it
essential
to
have
windbreaks
and
advise
planting
three
or
more
rows
of
and
russian
mulberry
for
windbreaks
on

montgomery
county
i
have
lived
in
the
state
ten
years
and
have
an
apple
orchard
of
trees
from
three
to
nine
years
old
for
market
i
prefer
jonathan
missouri
pippin
and
ben
davis
and
for
family
use
add
maiden
blush
i
prefer
hilltop
with
a
sandy
loam
and
a
porous
subsoil
i
prefer
trees
with
plenty
of
roots
i
plant
them
one
rod
north
and
south
and
two
rods
east
and
west
i
will
cultivate
my
orchard
as
long
as
the
trees
live
with
a
planet
cultivator
i
plant
strawberries
in
a
bearing
orchard
they
are
as
good
as
clover
windbreaks
would
be
beneficial
i
would
make
them
of
osage
orange
for
rabbits
i
rub
blood
on
the
trees
i
dig
the
borers
out
with
a
knife
and
wire
i
prune
very
little
with
the
pruning
shears
to
remove
watersprouts
and
interlocking
limbs
it
preserves
their
symmetry
but
does
not
make
them
more
fruitful
i
do
not
thin
the
fruit
while
on
the
trees
the
wind
does
it
for
me
my
trees
are
in
mixed
plantings
i
fertilize
my
orchard
with
stable
litter
between
the
trees
it
is
very
beneficial
and
i
would
advise
its
use
on
all
soils
excepting
very
rich
bottoms
where
it
would
cause
too
much
wood
growth
at
the
expense
of
the
fruit
i
do
not
pasture
my
orchard
it
is
not
advisable
my
trees
are
troubled
with
root
aphis
roundhead
borer
and
and
my
apples
with
and
curculio
i
am
successful
in
spraying
using
london
purple
with
a
pump
when
the
appear
and
a
few
days
afterward
for
i
remove
the
earth
from
around
the
trees
and
pour
in
tobacco
water
i
do
not
dry
any
i
do
not
irrigate
prices
have
been
forty
cents
for
apples
in
the
fall
one
dollar
per
bushel
during
the
winter
while
lasted
and
two
dollars
per
bushel
now
april
dried
apples
sold
for
five
to
ten
cents
per
pound
according
to
quality
bilsing

cowley
county
i
have
lived
in
kansas
years
have
an
orchard
of
sixty
apple
trees
from
sixteen
to
years
old
for
market
i
prefer
ben

limber

jonathan

grimes
golden
pippin
and
for
family
use
jonathan
grimes
golden
pippin
red
june
and
maiden
blush
have
tried
and
discarded
big
romanite
it
is
a
good
grower
but
a
poor
bearer
i
prefer
bottom
land
with
sandy
loam
and
clay
subsoil
and
a
north
slope
prefer
thrifty
trees
set
in
land
which
has
been
plowed
as
deeply
as
possible
and
the
soil
loosened
fifteen
to
eighteen
inches
by
digging
my
trees
are
set
feet
this
is
a
little
too
wide
north
and
south
i
am
still
cultivating
my
first
planting
of
trees
use
a
plow
harrow
and
cultivator
plant
corn
in
a
young
orchard
and
cease
cropping
after
eight
or
ten
years
windbreaks
are
essential
would
make
them
of
peach
groves
for
quick
growth
or
for
slower
and
surer
growth
would
make
them
of
several
rows
of
osage
orange
or
ash
set
fifteen
to
sixteen
feet
east
and
west
by
breaking
rows
i
prune
my
trees
from
the
beginning
with
a
think
it
pays
do
not
thin
the
fruit
on
the
trees
fertilize
my
orchard
with
ashes
and
stable
litter
think
it
beneficial
as
it
keeps
the
ground
from
packing
and
also
keeps
the
trees
vigorous
would
not
advise
its
use
on
very
sandy
soils
do
not
pasture
my
orchard
am
going
to
try
it
with
young
pigs
and
calves
my
trees
are
troubled
with
root
aphis
and
borers
and
my
apples
with
curculio
and
gouger
have
sprayed
three
seasons
soon
after
the
blossom
fell
and
until
the
apples
were
the
size
of
marbles
using
london
purple
think
i
killed
the
first
brood
of
but
a
later
brood
came
which
hurt
the
fruit

early
harvest
and
blush
bottom
land
is
best
in
this
locality
i
prefer
soil
somewhat
clayish
underlaid
with
limestone
with
a
north
or
east
slope
prefer
good
and
stocky
trees
would
plant
on
upland
twenty
by
feet
and
on
rich
bottom
by
feet
i
believe
in
thorough
cultivation
and
during
the
first
two
years
i
use
the
hoe
i
cultivate
until
five
or
six
years
old
usually
growing
corn
as
it
protects
the
trees
from
the
strong
south
winds
i
then
sow
to
clover
changing
every
two
or
three
years
to
or
corn
trees
planted
close
north
and
south
form
their
own
windbreaks
for
rabbits
wrap
the
trees
i
prune
a
little
to
keep
the
trees
from
getting
too
heavy
on
the
north
side
i
should
thin
missouri
pippins
to
keep
from
overbearing
i
should
use
sawdust
and
fertilizer
on
spots
i
allow
no
live
stock
in
the
orchard
but
poultry
am
troubled
some
with
and
i
spray
as
soon
as
the
leaves
start
for
and
using
one
pound
of
london
purple
to
gallons
of
water
for
borers
keep
the
trees
thrifty
borers
can
not
thrive
as
the
sap
will
kill
them
i
believe
it
would
be
well
during
the
first
two
years
to
wash
the
trees
with
a
solution
of
soft
soap
and
water
in
may
and
june
i
sort
in
first
second
and
cider
or
culls
pack
in
barrels
so
full
they
can
not
bruise
i
expect
to
put
in
an
evaporator
and
use
natural
gas
for
fuel
and
think
it
will
pay
i
recommend
subsoiling
to
retain
moisture
prices
have
ranged
here
from
thirty
to
fifty
cents
per
bushel

and
all
the
manure
i
can
get

such

beneficial
for

on

opposed
to

much
troubled

spray
before

after

with

followed
by

imperial

golden

and

are
also
favorites
we
find
the
yellow
bellflower
newtown
pippin
lawver
and
a
few
others
are
condemned
all
over
the
state
in
the
eastern
third
of
the
state
hilltop
or
slope
is
preferred
to
bottom
land
but
in
the
central
and
western
portions
bottom
land
is
preferred
the
reason
for
this
is
obvious
any
good
soil
is
satisfactory
if
subsoil
is
porous
the
favorite
distance
seems
to
be
feet
east
and
west
and
sixteen
to
twenty
feet
north
and
south
some
putting
peach
or
apples
between
the
wide
way
to
be
cut
out
when
they
crowd
this
undoubtedly
brings
the
quickest
returns
but
many
believe
it
robs
the
permanent
trees
of
their
future
sustenance
prefer
trees
one
to
two
years
old
to
want
and
give
no
age
it
is
only
a
matter
of
cost
and
convenience
a
tree
costs
less
and
allows
the
orchardist
to
set
more
trees
for
a
given
amount
of
cash
the
and
trees
require
the
removal
of
less
earth
and
are
more
readily
handled
and
planted
there
is
no
reason
why
an
apple
tree
three
inches
in
diameter
can
not
be
transplanted
as
easily
as
an
elm
or
maple
a
man
is
willing
to
set
a
few
large
at
a
cost
of
one
dollar
to
five
dollars
per
tree
but
can
not
feel
that
it
is
economy
to
set
orchard
trees
at
as
great
individual
expense
grafts
is
a
misleading
appellation
as
it
will
be
found
to
be
only
a
crown
graft
its
advocates
make
great
claims
that
are
at
variance
with
the
facts
there
can
scarcely
be
such
a
thing
unless
grafted
on
a
seedling
without
removal
of
such
seedling
from
the
earth
our
best
nurserymen
prefer
the
second
cut
about
one
and
to
three
inches
taken
from
the
seedling
root
a
couple
of
inches
below
the
crown
in
any
case
the
piece
of
root
taken
has
little
influence
on
the
future
tree
all
our
ordinary
varieties
make
roots
from
the
scion
and
the
original
seedling
root
may
be
found
like
the
piece
of
potato
we
plant
shriveled
and
useless
in
the
midst
of
the
new
roots
the
nature
of
the
root
growth
shows
this
plainly
as
all
its
peculiarities
will
be
found
to
be
a
counterpart
of
the
roots
of
the
variety
from
which
the
scion
was
cut
it
is
folly
to
pay
any
added
price
for
grafts
a
very
great
majority
believe
in
thorough
cultivation
at
least
for
from
six
to
ten
years
some
during
the
life
of
the
tree
nearly
all
agree
that
indian
corn
is
the
best
crop
to
grow
in
a
young
orchard
it
shades
the
ground
and
protects
from
wind
the
corn
in
a
young
orchard
should
not
be
cut
in
the
fall
neither
should
the
stalks
be
pastured
let
them
stand
till
spring
as
a
partial
protection
it
pays
many
parts
of
the
state
especially
the
western
half
believe
windbreaks
on
the
south
and
west
very
valuable
if
not
quite
necessary
with
the
outside
row
or
rows
of
russian
mulberries
and
perhaps
an
osage
orange
hedge
seem
to
meet
the
general
opinion
as
a
protection
from
rabbits
the
seem
most
economical
and
the
favorite
the
cost
is
little
and
the
boys
and
girls
or
the
farmer
and
his
wife
at
odd
times
can
put
them
on
it
is
an
open
question
as
to
the
benefit
or
harm
of
leaving
them
on
permanently
for
the
first
five
years
it
looks
slovenly
but
certainly
has
many
arguments
in
its
favor
the
idea
of
boring
into
an
apple
tree
and
placing
therein
sulphur
asafetida
or
other
drugs
does
not
really
deserve
a
serious
thought
it
is
impossible
for
the
tree
to
assimilate
these
substances
especially
sulphur
and
carry
them
to
the
foliage
or
fruit
for
preventive
or
any
other
purpose
boring
and
plugging
like
any
other
threatened
death
to
the
tree
may
cause
temporary
fruitfulness
as
also
will
girdling
while
several
washes
are
claimed
to
prevent
or
destroy
borers
the
large
majority
of
extensive
orchardists
believe
the
knife
and
a
hooked
wire
in
the
hands
of
a
thoroughgoing
employee
the
best
and
surest
way
of
knowing
that
you
destroy
the
larva
of
this
persistent
and
destructive
insect
smearing
trees
with
any
undiluted
grease
especially
axle
grease
made
from
petroleum
refuse
is
hazardous
and
the
man
who
advises
it
is
an
enemy
to
your
orchard
if
you
have
applied
it
the
sooner
you
wash
it
off
the
longer
will
your
orchard
thrive
pruning
has
its
advocates
but
the
eastern
style
of
a
long
stem
has
scarcely
a
follower
in
our
state
a
great
majority
simply
cut
out
watersprouts
and
limbs
that
cross
or
rub
or
are
thinning
on
the
trees
has
many
advocates
but
few
followers
all
admit
it
would
often
improve
the
size
and
quality
yet
most
growers
believe
the
difference
would
not
be
sufficient
to
pay
for
the
labor
and
it
would
require
skilled
labor
to
do
it
without
injury
a
large
number
perhaps
a
majority
believe
it
pays
to
apply
fertilizers
more
especially
litter
to
the
orchard
but
cases
are
known
where
it
has
done
much
harm
all
agree
that
it
should
be
kept
away
from
the
body
of
the
tree
as
to
pasturing
the
orchard
some
think
it
pays
others
that
it
does
no
harm
others
still
and
they
are
many
condemn
it
the
larger
proportion
of
those
who
pasture
confine
the
stock
to
calves
colts
and
pigs
some
would
allow
only
poultry
in
the
orchard
and
the
poultry
must
not
roost
in
the
trees
this
latter
point
is
an
excellent
one
we
find
we
have
plenty
of
insects
this
is
natural
insects
settle
in
a
country
that
provides
proper
food
for
them
and
their
larva
as
apple
trees
are
planted
in
new
localities
the
insects
that
delight
in
wood
roots
foliage
and
fruits
immigrate
grow
and
multiply
spraying
or
using
some
preventive
or
destroyer
has
become
necessary
and
the
man
who
believes
it
unnecessary
and
intends
to
trust
to
nature
or
providence
or
god
will
find
no
truer
saying
than
god
helps
those
who
help
themselves
sit
down
calmly
and
watch
the
worms
eat
your
trees
trust
to
the
woodpecker
and
the
sparrows
and
you
will
in
time
buy
apples
from
your
more
active
thoroughgoing
neighbor
or
go
without
methods
of
picking
do
not
vary
much
yet
all
agree
that
it
should
be
done
carefully
if
shaken
from
the
tree
poured
out
carelessly
or
jolted
about
in
a
lumber
wagon
it
simply
increases
the
culls
and
decreases
the
cash
returns
sorting
is
done
in
various
ways
a
sorting
table
or
device
is
explained
elsewhere
but
a
majority
seem
to
make
three
classes
first
class
the
unblemished
best
of
each
variety
culls
which
are
the
unmarketable
specked
bruised
and
gnarled
fruit
second
class
which
are
between
the
other
two
and
really
valuable
for
immediate
use
in
some
cases
the
second
best
have
been
put
in
cold
storage
and
they
sold
well
after
the
usual
fall
glut
packing
while
there
are
many
who
handle
in
a
small
way
in
boxes
and
the
time
is
near
when
all
fancy
apples
will
be
marketed
in
boxes
yet
all
the
larger
growers
use
barrels
and
it
is
encouraging
to
find
they
use
full
barrels
the
barrels
should
be
boycotted
out
of
existence
marketing
in
our
large
districts
the
crop
is
generally
wholesaled
either
in
the
orchard
or
subject
to
delivery
at
the
railroad
generally
in
barrels
in
the
western
half
of
the
state
the
apples
are
largely
taken
in
bulk
in
wagons
hauled
farther
west
and
south
and
sold
at
a
good
profit
to
the
wagoner
thousands
of
are
thus
disposed
of
every
year
the
same
wagons
often
appear
in
the
same
neighborhood
year
after
year
to
the
mutual
advantage
of
all
shipping
to
distant
markets
by
the
growers
especially
when
consigned
has
been
generally
unsatisfactory
i
need
not
give
reasons
my
own
experience
along
similar
lines
makes
me
hot
under
the
hat
when
i
think
over
it
drying
is
not
practiced
to
the
extent
that
it
ought
to
be
it
seems
almost
a
sin
to
allow
so
many
thousands
of
bushels
of
apples
to
rot
on
the
ground
every
year
simply
because
the
owner
lacks
faith
in
his
ability
to
turn
them
into
a
product
that
will
keep
while
he
looks
up
a
market
dried
apples
are
in
demand
hundreds
of
tons
of
them
and
kansas
dried
apples
stand
as
good
chances
to
bring
as
remunerative
prices
to
the
manufacturer
as
those
from
other
states
if
the
work
is
economically
done
a
profit
is
sure
storing
for
winter
is
described
elsewhere
cold
storage
cave
storage
and
cellar
storage
all
know
that
after
the
perishable
and
inferior
apples
are
gone
good
winter
apples
bring
sure
and
large
returns
how
best
to
preserve
them
is
a
vital
question
the
art
of
keeping
apples
by
the
artificial
process
is
yet
imperfect
and
unsatisfactory
and
the
losses
have
been
so
great
that
unless
the
owner
of
the
plant
will
take
part
of
the
risk
at
least
to
the
extent
of
his
fee
he
will
find
the
average
grower
standing
back
to
lose
your
apples
and
then
pay
fifty
cents
per
barrel
to
the
man
whose
ignorance
or
carelessness
may
have
caused
the
loss
is
a
burden
too
heavy
to
be
borne
the
hillside
cave
is
described
elsewhere
and
the
orchardist
who
has
such
a
cave
well
built
and
gives
it
careful
attention
will
save
a
large
portion
of
the
fee
and
have
his
apples
always
under
his
own
supervision
besides
saving
in
hauling
and
perhaps
railroad
freight
to
and
from
a
distant
plant
house
cellars
small
caves
and
buried
heaps
each
and
all
have
their
advocates
mostly
for
family
use
or
among
the
small
growers
it
seems
to
be
determined
that
the
winesap
is
the
better
keeper
followed
closely
by
the
missouri
pippin
and
ben
davis
of
less
marketable
varieties
rawle
janet
and
rambo
seem
to
keep
best
the
per
cent
of
loss
excepting
in
a
few
cases
does
not
seem
great
considering
the
usually
greatly
increased
value
of
the
sound
apples
the
reports
from
those
who
irrigate
are
not
as
full
as
we
could
wish
it
is
claimed
that
with
irrigation
every
apple
becomes
a
perfect
specimen
of
its
kind
that
there
are
no
culls
if
this
is
so
and
we
hope
it
is
what
a
grand
opening
for
those
rightly
situated
our
lakin
correspondent
sells
his
apples
at
top
prices
at
the
tree
for
cash
to
men
who
could
but
do
not
heed
the
injunction
go
thou
and
do
likewise
prices

the

the
lion
share
on
the
whole
a
close
study
of
all
that
is
in
this
book

to
give
an
impetus
to
the

the
careful

of

the

to

by

of
coffeyville
before
the
kansas
state
horticultural
society
at
a
summer
meeting
in
coffeyville
june
beginning
in
the
early
roman
period
the
apple
has
been
handed
down
through
the
successive
ages
as
the
standard
fruit
true
the
hard
bitter
uneatable
crab
or
wild
apple
of
former
times
was
not
much
like
the
tempting
apple
of
yet
it
is
the
parent
of
all
or
nearly
all
the
varieties
of
apples
so
much
prized
at
the
present
time
from
its
great
hardiness
easy
cultivation
and
long
continuance
through
the
whole
twelve
months
it
may
be
styled
the
king
of
all
fruits
the
apple
tree
is
now
one
of
the
most
widely
diffused
of
and
in
the
estimation
of
many
is
the
most
valuable
but
what
has
brought
about
this
great
change
in
tree
and
fruit
the
same
cause
which
makes
the
man
of
america
or
europe
superior
to
the
tribes
of
northern
africa
or
india
the
same
cause
by
which
the
most
wonderful
inventions
of
any
age
have
been
placed
before
the
public
cultivation
and
constant
attention
having
made
these
questions
a
study
for
years
or
more
and
having
gathered
all
the
points
possible
from
the
experience
of
the
with
whom
we
have
come
in
contact
we
have
become
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
growth
of
a
perfect
fruit
is
possible
in
this
climate
one
of
the
main
difficulties
in
a
general
business
is
encountered
in
a
hard
subsoil
too
hard
when
it
is
dry
and
too
soft
and
yielding
when
wet
deep
and
thorough
draining
is
therefore
a
great
requisite
in
tree
culture
the
next
step
would
be
the
means
for
securing
plenty
of
moisture
we
would
first
open
trenches
each
way
not
less
than
feet
apart
they
should
be
thrown
out
as
deep
as
can
be
done
with
a
plow
then
followed
by
subsoiler
twelve
to
eighteen
inches
deep
draw
the
surface
earth
back
into
the
crosses
creating
a
mound
plant
the
trees
there
and
fill
up
the
ditches
by
and
bring
the
land
to
a
perfect
level
it
will
not
pay
to
plant
trees
on
soil
without
preparation
it
is
better
to
avoid
the
altogether
and
select
a
deep
rich
subsoil
trees
planted
in
river
bottoms
have
been
known
to
be
vigorous
and
productive
after
years
while
those
on
the
prairie
planted
at
the
same
time
have
entirely
disappeared
the
best
time
for
planting
is
in
november
in
order
that
the
fiber
roots
may
be
ready
for
the
first
warm
days
of
february
nice
healthy
trees
from
two
to
three
years
old
should
be
selected
cut
the
tops
back
and
trim
off
most
of
the
fiber
roots
the
reason
for
cutting
the
tops
back
is
to
make
the
tree
more
productive
more
easily
harvested
and
to
aid
in
keeping
off
the
tree
borers
of
which
we
will
speak
later
our
orchards
should
not
be
allowed
to
grow
up
in
waste
and
neglect
neither
should
they
be
planted
in
those
things
which
sap
the
life
of
the
soil
and
leave
nothing
to
sustain
the
tree
one
of
the
main
causes
of
of
the
apple
orchard
is
land
starvation
an
orchard
can
not
produce
fruit
in
addition
to
a
crop
of
wheat
oats
rye
etc
and
so
if
a
man
continues
to
take
off
crops
of
these
every
year
he
simply
does
it
at
the
expense
of
his
trees
there
are
crops
however
which
may
be
used
with
good
effect
such
as
corn
peas
hay
potatoes
etc
in
this
the
owner
gets
the
profit
of
his
fruit
and
also
the
use
of
his
land
yet
with
all
our
care
of
the
soil
minuteness
in
following
directions
as
to
setting
out
and
trimming
there
are
other
difficulties
still
to
overcome
many
kinds
of
insects
may
infest
the
trunks
and
larger
branches
of
the
trees
among
them
are
the
louse
and
flathead
borers
san
jose
scale
etc
i
would
name
the
borers
and
san
jose
scale
none
yet
found
in
the
sec
as
being
the
worst
of
the
pests
with
which
to
contend
the
borers
attack
the
trunks
and
larger
limbs
of
the
trees
they
seek
the
sunny
side
of
the
tree
not
being
found
where
the
sap
is
abundant
or
where
there
is
a
continual
shade
under
the
first
they
drown
and
under
the
last
they
weaken
and
die
this
is
a
strong
argument
in
favor
of
low
heading
and
shady
growth
of
the
trees
the
parent
of
the
borer
a
long
green
or
pale
brown
beetle
may
be
caught
and
destroyed
but
it
is
not
to
be
presumed
that
all
the
beetles
can
be
caught
it
becomes
necessary
to
examine
the
trees
quite
often
in
order
to
destroy
the
worms
hatched
from
the
eggs
of
the
uncaptured
beetles
to
detect
the
spots
which
indicate
the
whereabouts
of
these
worms
is
to
the
inexperienced
quite
a
difficult
undertaking
for
during
the
spring
and
until
quite
late
in
the
summer
there
are
no
external
marks
save
a
small
speck
or
perhaps
a
dark
blue
line
so
fine
that
it
will
not
attract
the
attention
of
those
not
understanding
the
cause
when
they
are
first
detected
a
sharp
knife
may
be
used
to
remove
them
but
if
they
have
entered
the
wood
about
the
only
way
of
removing
them
is
by
means
of
a
probe
made
of
common
broom
wire
with
which
to
thrust
them
through
or
drag
them
out
of
their
holes
the
san
jose
scale
a
native
of
australia
was
first
found
on
the
american
continent
in
california
in
it
has
not
troubled
kansas
yet
but
it
is
quite
prevalent
in
the
western
states
and
as
it
spreads
rapidly
it
is
much
feared
its
detection
is
almost
the
work
of
a
specialist
yet
there
are
a
few
general
characteristics
which
may
be
detected
by
the
naked
eye
for
instance
the
bark
of
the
tree
loses
its
vigorous
healthy
appearance
and
takes
on
a
rough
gray
scurfy
deposit
as
yet
i
have
heard
of
no
permanent
cure
spraying
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
keeping
off
the
insects
of
which
the
is
getting
to
be
one
of
the
worst
from
the
upper
branches
of
the
trees
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
that
a
tree
should
not
be
sprayed
because
it
has
not
been
infested
by
any
insect
or
fungous
growth
the
attacks
of
both
are
often
unnoticed
at
first
and
the
man
who
is
not
prepared
for
them
often
neglects
spraying
until
it
is
too
late
to
save
the
crop
of
that
year
my
experience
in
regard
to
the
varieties
of
apples
grown
has
been
quite
varied
my
first
orchard
in
did
well
i
took
great
pains
in
setting
it
out
and
for
five
years
there
were
none
of
the
injurious
insects
which
make
us
so
much
trouble
in
my
second
orchard
ten
years
later
i
made
great
mistakes
in
the
varieties
i
chose
some
of
them
not
being
adapted
to
either
soil
or
climate
by
the
time
i
set
my
third
orchard
six
years
from
then
my
experience
had
taught
me
that
the
varieties
which
were
best
for
home
and
commercial
purposes
and
which
were
best
adapted
to
both
the
soil
and
climate
were
the
ben
davis
missouri
pippin
and
mother
and
in
these
varieties
i
planted
most
of
my
orchard
the
habits
of
the
ben
davis
and
missouri
pippin
are
too
well
known
to
need
further
description
in
my
orchard
i
found
them
both
my
ben
davis
began
to
die
out
at
twenty
years
and
a
very
few
reached
the
age
of
the
mother
is
an
apple
not
so
well
known
it
originated
at
bolton
mass
tree
is
moderately
vigorous
upright
and
productive
one
of
the
best
apples
on
the
list
there
and
i
consider
it
equally
so
here
thomas
the
american
fruit
culturist
in
his
description
of
the
apple
says
it
is
rather
large
oblong
ovate
approaching
conical
slightly
and
obtusely
ribbed
color
a
light
warm
rich
red
on
a
yellow
ground
moderately
juicy
rich
very
mild
subacid
with
a
mixture
of
sweet
growth
slow
late
autumnal
and
early
winter
however
it
ripens
earlier
in
this
climate
follows
the
maiden
blush
downing
says
no
orchard
is
complete
without
it
while
the
ben
davis
missouri
pippin
and
mother
are
my
favorites
for
productiveness
we
have
other
varieties
that
are
quite
productive
and
trees
such
as
the
early
margaret
or
striped
june
that
is
an
annual
and
profuse
bearer
and
one
of
our
earliest
duchess
of
oldenburg
has
never
failed
with
me
maiden
blush
has
given
good
success
we
have
the
romanite
rawle
janet
and
limber
twig
that
are
good
keepers
but
owing
to
size
are
not
desirable
for
home
use
or
market
i
find
more
complaint
of
the
ben
davis
than
any
other
apple
though
its
beauty
invariably
causes
it
to
sell
my
greatest
mistake
in
planting
was
in
selecting
rhode
island
greening
and
nonsuch
which
have
proven
almost
the
trees
are
healthy
and
grow
almost
like
an
elm
or
oak
a
number
of
varieties
such
as
the
mammoth
black
twig
arkansas
black
muklen
rome
beauty
i
have
not
fruited
and
can
not
tell
as
to
their
qualities
in
this
locality
in
all
my
experience
in
the
apple
line
i
find
that
no
orchard
will
grow
and
bear
without
attention
and
constant
attention
at
that
the
apple
tree
requires
as
much
interest
from
its
owner
as
cattle
do
from
the
from
a
tiny
seed
it
is
subject
to
disease
and
pests
which
if
not
destroyed
will
destroy
it
i
would
say
in
conclusion
that
success
in
apple
raising
comes
only
through
eternal
vigilance
orchard
culture
by
james
mcnicol
lost
springs
marion
county
kansas
orchard
culture
being
my
subject
of
course
the
varieties
of
trees
are
supposed
to
be
carefully
selected
and
planted
but
the
distance
apart
is
important
if
too
close
no
matter
how
thorough
the
cultivation
they
will
suffer
for
moisture
and
if
too
wide
apart
the
winds
will
play
havoc
with
the
trees
and
fruit
what
is
best
for
this
locality
to
break
the
prevailing
south
winds
and
yet
have
plenty
of
space
for
the
roots
to
find
moisture
is
it
better
to
plant
closely
north
and
south
or
east
and
west
i
would
prefer
close
rows
running
east
and
west
as
each
row
would
help
break
the
wind
when
the
trees
in
the
row
reached
each
other
then
how
close
in
the
row
and
how
far
apart
the
rows
i
would
plant
the
trees
twenty
feet
apart
in
the
rows
and
the
rows
thirty
feet
apart
i
would
like
to
recommend
planting
a
row
of
cherry
dwarf
pear
plum
or
peach
between
each
apple
row
provided
they
are
cut
out
when
they
rob
each
other
of
moisture
eternal
vigilance
is
the
price
of
fruit
but
in
central
kansas
to
eternal
vigilance
you
must
add
thorough
cultivation
for
a
few
years
cultivated
crops
may
be
grown
leaving
a
good
space
next
to
the
trees
to
be
cultivated
not
to
grow
up
in
weeds
do
not
like
one
of
my
neighbors
cultivate
the
corn
row
that
cost
only
about
five
cents
a
row
for
seed
four
times
and
leave
the
tree
row
which
cost
two
dollars
per
row
uncultivated
do
not
use
a
stirring
plow
it
will
hill
up
earth
around
the
trees
too
much
with
a
lister
you
can
list
in
your
corn
or
furrow
out
potato
rows
running
east
and
west
one
year
and
north
and
south
the
next
growing
crops
for
five
or
six
years
is
long
enough
then
cultivation
should
be
done
with
a
disc
an
acme
or
a
common
harrow
i
prefer
a
reversible
disc
acme
is
all
right
if
you
do
not
let
the
weeds
get
the
start
of
you
which
you
should
never
do
but
you
will
sometimes
then
the
disc
is
the
implement
whatever
tool
you
use
keep
it
a
going
east
west
and
diagonal
and
when
blessed
with
a
good
rain
through
the
summer
do
wait
till
the
weeds
get
started
but
cultivate
as
soon
as
dry
enough
to
form
a
dust
mulch
few
seem
to
know
the
value
of
a
dust
mulch
a
high
state
of
cultivation
can
be
kept
up
in
the
orchard
with
what
implements
the
farmer
has
use
the
cultivator
close
to
the
trees
and
the
cultivator
for
the
middle
going
both
ways
then
pulverize
with
the
harrow
use
the
harrow
often
six
days
work
at
the
proper
time
will
keep
a
orchard
in
good
shape
the
whole
season
but
says
some
one
it
does
pay
this
is
not
a
fruit
country
no
it
is
no
fruit
country
and
never
will
be
to
the
one
who
has
no
time
to
cultivate
but
to
the
one
that
will
there
is
a
big
reward
for
the
very
reason
that
it
is
not
a
fruit
country
orchard
treatment
a
paper
read
before
the
kansas
horticultural
society
by
cellar
of
edwardsville
a
wide
difference
of
opinion
prevails
as
to
the
proper
distance
apart
for
apple
trees
some
growers
maintaining
that
forty
feet
is
close
enough
while
others
plant
as
close
as
fifteen
feet
with
varieties
that
come
into
bearing
early
planting
close
in
the
row
north
and
south
with
the
intention
of
cutting
out
every
other
tree
when
they
are
large
enough
to
crowd
may
be
good
husbandry
two
or
three
crops
might
be
secured
before
it
would
be
necessary
to
cut
out
the
extra
trees
the
objections
are
that
the
orchard
can
not
be
so
thoroughly
cultivated
and
the
drain
necessary
to
grow
the
extra
trees
might
so
debilitate
the
soil
as
to
seriously
affect
succeeding
crops
one
grower
says
i
am
satisfied
it
will
pay
in
the
short
run
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
it
will
pay
in
the
long
run
in
this
section
where
we
have
so
much
wind
and
sunshine
to
thirty
feet
seems
to
be
the
proper
distance
for
apple
trees
fifteen
feet
for
plums
and
fifteen
by
twenty
feet
for
peach
and
cherry
and
twenty
feet
for
pear
trees
upland
is
thought
better
than
river
bottom
for
orchards
and
a
north
or
east
slope
is
chosen
for
apples
a
difference
in
location
is
required
for
different
varieties
of
apples
a
variety
will
do
well
on
the
thin
soil
of
the
hills
while
a
variety
deficient
in
root
vigor
which
might
be
profitable
in
deep
soil
would
not
thrive
on
the
hilltops
i
gathered
this
year
from
missouri
pippin
trees
planted
in
the
deep
soil
of
a
creek
bottom
five
bushels
of
apples
to
the
tree
while
missouri
pippins
in
the
same
orchard
on
the
hilltops
planted
at
the
same
time
and
having
the
same
treatment
yielded
scarcely
a
bushel
to
the
tree
in
the
same
orchard
jonathans
yielded
about
as
well
on
the
hill
as
in
the
valley
i
would
not
choose
an
exposed
north
or
northwest
slope
for
peaches
or
cherries
better
an
east
or
even
a
south
slope
professor
whitten
of
the
missouri
state
agricultural
college
has
recommended
whitening
peach
trees
in
winter
by
spraying
with
lime
to
prevent
premature
swelling
of
the
buds
in
my
locality
the
best
varieties
of
apples
from
a
commercial
standpoint
are
ben
davis
jonathan
and
missouri
pippin
more
kieffer
and
duchess
pears
are
planted
than
any
other
kind
the
leading
peaches
are
elberta
old

the

is

best
for
either
a
family
or
commercial
orchard
cultivation
of
the
orchard
for
the
first
few
years
is
deemed
absolutely
necessary
to
success
but
it
is
a
serious
problem
how
to
cultivate
the
hills
and
at
the
same
time
keep
them
from
washing
into
the
hollows
and
so
denuding
the
roots
of
the
trees
at
the
top
i
know
one
orchard
in
which
a
back
furrow
has
been
thrown
to
each
tree
row
in
the
same
direction
for
several
years
leaving
a
dead
furrow
which
has
become
a
ditch
between
the
rows
it
looks
like
a
field
of
huge
rows
with
the
trees
standing
on
tripods
or
quadrapeds
at
the
top
of
the
ridges
neither
back
furrow
nor
dead
furrow
should
be
made
in
the
tree
row
as
few
dead
furrows
as
possible
should
be
left
they
should
be
frequently
changed
and
should
never
run
up
and
down
the
hill
if
ditches
have
started
they
can
not
be
stopped
by
plowing
them
full
of
earth
the
loose
soil
will
wash
out
at
the
first
rain
fill
them
with
old
hay
straw
stalks
or
brush
old
raspberry
or
blackberry
canes
are
excellent
for
this
purpose
begin
at
the
bottom
and
work
up
the
hill
letting
the
forkfuls
overlap
like
shingles
drive
a
stake
through
at
frequent
intervals
and
secure
firmly
at
the
top
else
a
hard
freshet
will
wash
it
all
out
deep
ditches
may
be
filled
by
dams
of
loose
stone
a
rod
or
two
apart
on
many
farms
these
stones
need
to
be
gathered
anyway
and
one
may
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
by
filling
a
big
ditch
with
a
good
many
stones
an
ounce
of
prevention
however
is
worth
a
pound
of
cure
and
the
best
prevention
from
washing
that
i
know
of
is
clover
i
would
advise
seeding
a
hill
orchard
as
soon
as
the
trees
have
had
a
year
or
two
of
vigorous
growth
the
orchard
may
be
cultivated
after
the
spring
rains
and
seeded
again
in
time
to
prevent
washing
the
next
winter
after
the
orchard
is
seven
or
eight
years
old
i
should
leave
it
in
clover
and
weeds
mowing
two
or
three
times
a
year
to
make
a
mulch
and
prevent
tall
growth
of
weeds
hogs
in
the
orchard
is
generally
condemned
i
have
seen
old
orchards
however
that
were
decidedly
benefited
by
hogs
hogs
and
plums
go
together
this
is
no
theory
but
an
established
fact
let
them
rub
the
trees
as
much
as
they
will
let
them
tramp
the
ground
till
it
is
as
bare
and
as
hard
as
the
road
it
will
do
no
harm
it
will
do
good
hogs
may
not
like
green
apples
but
there
is
something
specially
delectable
to
a
hog
in
a
green
wormy
plum
he
will
pick
up
every
one
that
drops
and
so
diminish
the
crop
of
curculio
in
my
locality
pruning
of
apple
and
cherry
orchards
is
practiced
very
sparingly
cutting
out
broken
decayed
and
interlacing
branches
and
the
suckers
at
the
base
seems
to
be
about
all
the
pruning
that
is
desirable
peach
and
plum
orchards
are
likewise
neglected
though
some
growers
practice
heading
in
to
make
the
trees
grow
more
compact
and
to
thin
the
fruit
i
think
that
with
tall
and
straggling
apple
trees
such
as
missouri
pippin
winesap
or
minkler
heading
in
might
be
profitably
practiced
the
question
as
to
the
profit
of
spraying
for
insects
and
fungi
as
far
as
my
observation
goes
is
not
settled
yet
the
theory
is
all
right
indeed
it
has
become
one
of
the
strongest
articles
of
faith
in
the
horticulturist
creed
when
the
subject
comes
up
in
the
horticultural
meeting
all
commend
it
very
few
growers
however
make
a
business
of
spraying
most
of
the
growers
in
my
locality
who
used
to
spray
have
quit
it
they
deny
that
they
have
lost
faith
in
it
but
they
do
do
it
my
opinion
based
not
on
my
own
experience
but
the
practice
or
rather
lack
of
practice
of
others
is
that
save
in
exceptional
cases
it
does
pay
that
the
ravages
of
and
curculio
are
not
appreciably
lessened
by
spraying
that
the
loss
from
scab
in
this
dry
climate
is
so
light
as
not
to
justify
the
cost
of
spraying
that
just
as
many
of
the
doctrines
of
the
churchmen
would
die
out
if
the
preachers
should
turn
teachers
so
the
doctrine
of
spraying
as
a
would
die
out
if
the
pump
men
and
experimenters
should
turn
that
the
average
man
believes
in
a
perfunctory
way
many
things
which
his
experience
forbids
him
to
practice
the
damage
from
borers
is
a
serious
drawback
to
orcharding
there
are
various
patent
contrivances
and
washes
that
are
recommended
to
prevent
the
work
of
borers
but
all
so
far
as
my
observation
goes
fall
short
of
complete
success
the
only
safe
way
is
to
hunt
the
borers
out

just
took
his

not
to

i
know
economy

i
do
not

it
best
to

closely
if
you
put

i
believe
it
benefits
some
orchards
to
run
hogs
in

i
tried
it
on
an
orchard
that
had
ceased
bearing
i
inclosed
the
orchard
and
put
hogs
in
for
a
year
or
more
new
growth
started
on
the
trees
and
they
at
once
began
to
bear
and
bore
for
several
years
after
i
took
the
hogs
out
i
could
see
no
injury
caused
by
their
rubbing
the
trees
i
do
not
think
they
will
rub
the
trees
if
the
orchard
is
large
i
do
not
see
what
injury
they
do
after
the
apples
grew
large
enough
if
wormy
they
fell
and
the
hogs
ate
the
apples
and
the
worms
also
edwin
taylor
i
have
had
a
little
experience
in
that
line
i
fenced
around
a
orchard
expecting
to
combine
horticulture
and
agriculture
right
there
my
hogs
were
lousy
and
they
did
rub
the
trees
and
whenever
they
rub
they
destroy
anybody
who
tries
it
will
find
they
will
absolutely
squeal
for
something
to
eat
when
there
are
bushels
of
apples
on
the
ground

was
at
large
expense

cold
storage
by
geo
richardson
of
leavenworth
kan
it
has
been
well
said
that
necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention
cold
storage
of
the
present
time
is
understood
as
mechanical
refrigeration
and
in
general
the
preservation
of
perishable
articles
by
means
of
low
temperature
hence
the
act
of
reducing
the
temperature
of
any
body
or
maintaining
the
same
below
the
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
is
called
refrigeration
or
more
familiarly
known
as
cold
storage
produced
by
the
employment
of
machinery
of
various
types
of
those
mostly
in
use
are
the
compression
system
using
anhydrous
ammonia
as
a
refrigerant
by
expanding
the
ammonia
either
directly
through
coils
of
pipe
arranged
in
the
storage
rooms
or
through
coils
of
pipe
that
are
submerged
in
salt
brine
where
the
brine
is
reduced
to
a
low
temperature
and
then
forced
and
circulated
through
pipes
in
the
storage
rooms
one
being
known
as
direct
expansion
the
other
brine
circulation
but
both
accomplish
same
results
to
utilize
anhydrous
ammonia
requires
complicated
and
expensive
machinery
and
to
those
not
acquainted
with
the
subject
it
may
seem
strange
that
more
units
of
heat
are
produced
by
the
burning
of
coal
wood
or
oil
than
there
are
units
of
cold
produced
to
reduce
the
temperature
of
storage
rooms
of
the
uses
and
benefits
of
cold
storage
it
can
be
truthfully
stated
that
nothing
in
recent
years
has
been
of
more
direct
benefit
to
the
farmer
and
but
a
brief
period
has
passed
since
cellars
caves
and
underground
grottos
served
as
the
best
means
and
in
a
limited
way
under
certain
conditions
of
weather
for
the
protection
and
preservation
of
perishable
articles
machinery
has
made
it
possible
to
control
temperature
at
any
degree
and
in
all
climates
the
burning
heat
under
the
equator
would
not
be
an
impediment
to
secure
a
zero
temperature
in
a
room
the
construction
and
successful
operation
of
the
mammoth
are
the
outgrowth
of
the
success
of
the
application
of
mechanical
refrigeration
where
any
day
of
the
year
a
market
is
made
for
live
stock
but
few
years
have
elapsed
since
the
vast
herds
of
south
american
cattle
had
no
value
except
for
their
hides
horns
and
tallow
and
the
great
bands
of
australian
sheep
for
their
wool
now
immense

are
in

the

to
especially
those
engaged
in
apple
culture
cold
storage
is
attracting
more
than
common
interest
as
it
has
been
demonstrated
a
grand
success
in
the
preservation
of

from
three
to
six
months
longer
in
good
condition
than
in

that
is

to
the

at
the

time
the
apples
retain
their
original
and
individual
flavor

and

cold

or
mechanical

arrests

better
stated
prolongs

the

offers
a
place

affords
a
protection
for
the

if

conditions
are
not
favorable
such
as
an
overstocked

consequently
low

caused
largely
and
influenced
by
many
other
varieties
of
fruit
that
are
in
season
while
the
apple
crop
is
being
gathered
again
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
houses
has
brought
into
the
field
speculators
which
has
a
wholesome
influence
and
oftentimes
strengthens
the
markets
and
lessens
the
quantity
that
would
of
necessity
be
forced
on
sale
at
an
earlier
period
at
a
great
sacrifice
which
is
the
situation
this
year
where
the
enormous
crops
of
new
york
new
england
and
michigan
apples
are
being
sold
at
from
fifty
to
cents
a
barrel
including
barrels
placed
aboard

for
the
want
of
proper
and
sufficient
storage
facilities
to
relieve
part
of
the
burden
no
such
condition
or
low
price
has
yet
been
felt
by
the
western
grower
there
may
be
years
when
the
buyers
will
look
far
into
the
future
and
think
they
can
see
visions
of
long
prices
when
it
would
be
wise
for
the
growers
to
sell
as
there
is
some
risk
to
be
taken
as
to
future
markets
being
lower
than
prices
in
the
fall
but
such
is
not
the
rule
from
six
years
experience
with
mechanical
refrigeration
and
the
storage
of
apples
there
has
not
been
a
year
but
what
a

has
been
shown

it
is
gratifying
to
state
that
in

the

not
a

rejected

much
of

they

an

in

says
there

just

these

in
a
nervous
uneasy
often
blind
and
condition
going
through
a
change
from
the
luxury
of

to
burrow

tomb

doing
you
no

this
shows
the
absurdity
of
bands
of
cotton
placed
about
a
tree
when
the
bole
is
covered
with
worms
to
keep
them
from

defoliating

on

he
finds
them
in

has

sown
them
broadcast
over
his

had
he
been
observant
during

sunny
middays
of

he
would
have
noticed
insects
similar
to

crawling
up
the
bole
of
the

and
looking
closer
a
little
later
he
would
see

the

looking

a

thread
snipped
into
bits
about

these
millions

scarcely

occupy
their
time
eating

growing

the
orchardist
is
possibly
unaware
of
the
army
he
is
feeding

they
grow

heads

if
disturbed

quickly

their
life
as
worms
lasts
only
about
six
weeks
then
they
seem
suddenly
to
have

make
the
tons
of

entirely
from

on

spraying
with
london

paris
green
one
pound
with
two
pounds
of
lime
and
gallons
of
water
is
the
common
remedy
to
be
efficacious
the
drug
must
be
of
a
normal
strength
say
per
cent
arsenic
and
as
the
worms
grow
larger
and
stronger
the
water
must
be
lessened
when
the
worms
are
an
inch
or
more
long
it
may
require
only
fifty
gallons
of
water
another
formula
is
two
pounds
white
arsenic
four
pounds
sal
soda
two
gallons
of
water
boil
until
the
arsenic
is
dissolved
one
pint
is
enough
for
forty
gallons
of
water
as
the
worms
usually
feed
on
the
under
side
of
the
leaves
spraying
should
be
from
below
as
much
as
possible
the
early
bird
catches
the
worm
is
true
here
therefore
spray
while
the
worms
are
tiny
and
the
foliage
thin
and
the
work
will
count
as
the
stitch
in
time
destroying
nine
hundred

nearly
every
one
has
seen
the
tents
of
these
in
neglected

usually
betoken
the
too
busy
man

are

unsightly
bunches
of
webs
closely
woven
together
at
the
forks
of

at
the
ends
of

the
parents
of
these
worms
are
moths
see
fig
which
appear
in
june
each
year

deposit
their
eggs
in
clusters
containing
two

three
hundred
surrounding

sharp

bring

warm
days
of

and
the
tiny

immediately
seek
and
devour

chandler
i
used
a
tree
wash
last
year
on
apple
trees
for
borers
and
insects
i
have
been
troubled
in
my
timber
recently
cleared
land
with
borers
and
if
i
had
not
taken
this
precaution
they
would
have
been
worse
it
is
known
as
the
carnahan
tree
obtaining
it
ready
prepared
in
a
can
i
applied
it
in
june
with
a
whitewash
brush
to
the
tree
trunks
and
a
portion
of
the
limbs
and
found
it
very
beneficial
while
it
will
not
the
borer
i
think
it
will
prevent
the
borer
beetle
from
depositing
eggs
on
the
outside
from
the
healthy
appearance
of
the
tree
and
the
smooth
appearance
of
the
bark
i
think
it
equals
anything
i
ever
tried
it
is
also
good
for
the
prevention
of
other
insects
as
and
i
think
it
will
destroy
the
curculio
to
some
extent
and
will
prevent
insects
climbing
the
trees
my
trees
never
looked
more
thrifty
i
can
not
say
it
will
prevent
holsinger
i
would
like
to
inquire
whether
your
ground
was
thoroughly
cultivated
chandler
all
the
cultivation
i
could
give
would
not
prevent
borers
i
applied
the
wash
from
the
ground
up
as
far
as
i
could
reach
it
costs
about
two
cents
per
tree
from
four
to
six
years
old
and
i
do
not
know
but
what
that
might
be
reduced
this
wash
is
obtained
in
gallon
and
cans
it
should
be
applied
about
twice
a
year
spring
and
fall
costing
about
four
cents
per
year
for
each
tree
stanley
would
not
a
strong
lime
wash
do
as
well
chandler
no
i
have
no
success
with
it
if
the
borer
is
in
the
tree
you
must
dig
him
out
with
a
knife
by
examination
you
can
tell
whether
borers
have
deposited
eggs
or
not
i
do
not
say
it
will
rid
the
tree
of
borers
if
they
have
been
allowed
to
deposit
eggs
and
are
left
for
years
it
makes
the
tree
grow
more
vigorous
i
do
not
know
what
is
in
this
tree
wash
but
it
did
no
damage
smith
chandler
has
tried
this
wash
and
it
has
proven
successful
with
him
there
are
always
new
things
being
tried
if
he
has
found
something
good
for
trees
we
should
not
object
to
it
if
i
receive
a
package
i
will
try
it
stanley
my
experience
with
borers
will
date
back
as
far
as
fifty
years
ago
when
i
was
a
boy
and
the
best
thing
to
exterminate
them
with
was
a
a
boston
gentleman
visiting
my
father
went
into
the
orchard
and
asked
father
if
he
had
ever
seen
any
borers
father
told
him
he
knew
nothing
about
them
they
were
something
new
in
those
days
examining
a
tree
he
took
out
his
and
went
to
work
near
the
ground
and
he
soon
showed
why
the
tree
was
not
doing
well
with
his
knife
he
dug
the
borer
out
and
said
the
was
the
best
exterminator
he
knew
of
my
experience
is
if
you
will
attend
to
it
about
the
of
june
when
the
beetles
come
out
on
the
tree
and
deposit
their
eggs
behind
loose
scales
of
bark
and
wash
the
tree
with
strong
lime
wash
it
will
kill
them
i
prefer
lime
wash
to
any
nostrum
ever
introduced
when
they
once
get
into
the
tree
no
wash
will
take
them
out
horticulturists
have
been
deceived
enough
by
patent
nostrums
holman
by
instinct
this
insect
never
lays
its
eggs
on
the
surface
it
lays
as
completely
in
the
wood
as
the
locust
which
punctures
almost
to
the
heart
of
a
twig
a
borer
lives
three
years
in
the
wood
the
third
year
it
comes
out
in
perfect
form
it
goes
below
in
the
wood
every
winter
and
the
third
spring
passes
the
cocoon
stage
there
they
lay
about
fifty
eggs
each
placed
separate
and
apart
in
the
wood
rarely
does
an
egg
fail
to
hatch
robison
these
beetles
are
very
fierce
put
a
half
dozen
into
a
bottle
and
they
will
beat
a
bull
fight
and
will
not
stop
until
they
kill
each
other
she
is
a
philosopher
she
makes
punctures
sideways
so
the
eggs
can
be
laid
in
a
row
and
the
bark
close
over
them
it
is
only
a
few
days
until
they
hatch
open
the
lip
where
deposited
and
you
can
see
them
plainly
without
cutting
the
bark
thrust
your
knife
under
the
lip
and
you
can
hear
the
eggs
crack
the
larva
works
round
and
round
until
of
the
size
of
a
pea
and
then
usually
starts
upward
until
he
gets
level
with
the
surface
of
the
ground
staying
there
until
the
next
season
he
comes
up
early
in
the
spring
my
practice
is
to
hoe
around
the
tree
before
the
time
for
the
borer
to
deposit
eggs
i
keep
the
weeds
clear
so
that
i
can
see
where
the
borer
went
in
if
he
has
been
in
a
year
or
two
he
is
near
the
middle
and
you
had
better
let
him
alone
as
it
will
injure
the
tree
to
remove
him
it
is
impossible
to
get
rid
of
these
borers
by
a
wash
because
the
eggs
are
covered
there
is
no
connection
between
the
and
borers
stanley
it
requires
three
years
for
the
borer
to
mature
and
come
out
in
my
experience
the
borer
selects
a
spot
where
loose
bark
is
on
the
tree
and
goes
in
where
it
is
tender
it
lays
eggs
in
even
rows
these
eggs
stay
under
the
bark
but
a
short
time
when
they
hatch
and
the
little
worm
eats
into
the
tender
bark
and
goes
through
it
to
live
and
grow
there
when
large
enough
they
go
into
the
body
of
the
tree
they
stay
there
for
three
years
scrape
off
the
bark
and
put
whitewash
on
the
eggs
and
it
will
destroy
them
president
wellhouse
by
taking
a
knife
cutting
into
the
tree
and
running
a
hooked
wire
in
you
can
pull
them
out
each
female
beetle
deposits
fifty
or
sixty
eggs
and
we
find
it
better
and
less
expensive
to
hunt
the
borers
early
in
the
spring
by
carefully
examining
the
bottom
of
the
tree
for
six
or
eight
inches
above
the
ground
you
will
see
a
little
brown
spot
he
came
to
the
bark
the
fall
previous
and
sets
about
two
inches
back
in
his
cavity
if
you
wait
till
may
he
is
out
and
gone
he
is
easier
taken
out
in
spring
than
later
by
killing
the
insect
you
prevent
the
egg
laying
we
always
have
our
men
hunt
for
the
insects
that
are
about
to
come
out
it
is
easy
to
find
the
little
brown
spot
about
the
size
of
your

you
can
kill
them

a
few

prevent

i
have
practiced
banking
up
my
trees
as
steep
as
i
can
about
a
foot
high
less
may
do
the
beetle
will
not
deposit
eggs
where
the
tree
is
banked
up
i
have
practiced
this
for
thirty
years
and
have
never
seen
a
borer
in
my

i
began
it

gentlemen
i
at

cut

can
prevent

up
early

it
knows
the
bank
will
wash
down
if
it
deposits
its
eggs
how
easy
to
scrape
away
the
mound
i
never
saw
a
flathead
borer
on

that
was
banked

always
work
on

shines
on

this

is
often

destructive

in

mouthfuls
destroying

which
must
make
the
leaves
and
fruit
nipping
in

the
entire
crop
of
fruit
and
debilitating
the
tree
this
worm
works
in
early
spring
as
soon
as
the
buds
begin
to
open
it
delights
in
the
prominent
terminal
buds
and
its
work
stops
all
new
growth
causes
many
leaves
to
turn
brown
and
thus
brings
to
the
notice
of
the
orchardist
its
bad
work
the
moth
measures
about
of
an
inch
across
its
wings
and
is
mainly
a
gray
color
the
middle
of
the
fore
wings
being
lighter
or
creamy
this
insect
first
appears
on
the
buds
as
a
small
dark
brown
worm
about
of
an
inch
long
with
shining
black
head
and
shoulders
it
imbeds
itself
in
the
center
of
the
bud
tying
the
leaves
together
with
its
web
it
is
an
irregular
worker
and
leaves
the
bud
in
a
ragged
brown
dilapidated
condition
its
work
is
most
destructive
in
the
nursery
destroying
terminal
shoots
which
sadly
interferes
with
the
growth
and
symmetry
of
the
young
tree
sometimes
it
burrows
from
the
bud
into
the
pith
of
the
twig
for
several
inches
killing
the
shoot
to
the
tip
the
worm
finally
settles
upon
a
leaf
cutting
the
leaf
stalk
partly
off
so
that
the
leaf
withers
it
then
rolls
this
soft
wilted
leaf
into
a
tube
around
its
body
fastening
it
with
webs
and
lining
it
for
a
nest
from

it

it

careless
paring
is
wasteful

unnecessary
especially
when
the

the

hastening
the
process
of
expanding

and
converting
the

this
suggests
that
in
order
to
produce
the
desirable
lightness
the
oven
should
be
sufficiently
hot
to
change
the
water

addition
for

it
is

to
remove
the
core
before
cooking
and
when
the
apple
as
for
compote
is
not
to
be
otherwise
cut
after

it
should
be
cored

the

the
requisites

it
clean
before
cutting
to
remove
only
a
thin
paring
of
the
core

the
bruised
discolored

than
obscure
the
apple
flavor
using
