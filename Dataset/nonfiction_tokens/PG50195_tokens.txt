preface
the
very
extensive
sale
of
practical
etiquette
a
sale
that
has
required
the
issuance
of
a
large
number
of
editions
of
the
little
manual
has
been
very
gratifying
to
its
author
as
was
also
the
commission
of
its
publisher
to
and
enlarge
the
work
this
commission
however
brought
with
it
a
keen
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
author
feels
that
a
new
work
on
etiquette
can
find
a
only
in
a
fairly
successful
attempt
at
answering
practically
every
question
that
can
arise
concerning
social
relations
at
least
in
ordinary
social
life
but
to
speak
with
authority
on
all
matters
of
is
to
speak
dogmatically
and
so
to
speak
is
in
itself
not
good
form
nevertheless
and
in
spite
of
this
dilemma
the
author
has
attempted
herein
to
decide
when
compelled
to
do
so
between
conflicting
opinions
in
mere
matters
of
social
custom
and
has
given
as
authority
the
opinion
that
seemed
to
her
to
conform
most
nearly
to
common
sense
embodying
such
opinion
in
an
unqualified
statement
without
citing
authority
fortunately
social
customs
are
now
so
nearly
uniform
in
all
parts
of
the
country
that
one
familiar
with
the
ways
of
good
society
in
the
west
or
in
the
north
is
at
home
in
good
society
in
the
east
or
in
the
south
the
author
is
under
obligation
to
so
many
persons
for
suggestions
and
advice
as
well
as
to
many
authors
that
it
does
not
seem
best
to
give
a
list
of
the
same
especially
as
such
list
could
be
only
a
partial
one
for
many
of
her
friends
would
not
desire
mention
of
their
names

introduction
politeness
is
to
do
and
say
the
kindest
thing
in
the
kindest
if
civil
law
is
the
outgrowth
of
regard
for
other
rights
social
law
is
equally
the
outgrowth
of
regard
for
other
feelings
and
convenience
social
law
is
kindness
and
and
the
desire
to
be
agreeable
codified
a
system
of
so
much
importance
can
not
be
unworthy
of
consideration
the
very
essence
of
good
manners
is
and
is
another
name
for
gentility
is
neither
in
birth
manner
nor
fashion
but
in
the
mind
a
high
sense
of
honor
a
determination
never
to
take
a
mean
advantage
of
another
and
an
adherence
to
truth
delicacy
and
politeness
towards
those
with
whom
one
may
have
dealings
are
the
essential
and
distinguishing
characteristics
of
a
gentleman
quietness
in
all
things
is
an
essential
element
to
a
person
he
shuns
all
outward
display
of
his
personality
he
cares
not
to
be
seen
or
heard
he
eschews
noisy
and
grandiloquent
talk
he
avoids
showy
and
noticeable
costumes
his
voice
is
low
his
words
simple
and
his
actions
grave
he
holds
himself
habitually
under
restraint
his
words
never
seem
to
vibrate
with
emotion
habits
are
said
to
be
good
or
bad
as
the
result
of
actions
that
are
right
or
wrong
a
man
of
good
habits
is
one
who
has
for
so
long
a
time
practiced
right
thinking
speaking
and
doing
that
he
acts
properly
from
force
of
habit
good
manners
are
not
to
be
put
on
for
particular
occasions
like
fine
clothes
but
they
should
be
second
nature
the
simpler
and
more
easy
and
unconstrained
manners
the
more
he
will
impress
people
with
his
good
breeding
affectation
is
one
of
the
brazen
marks
of
vulgarity
illustration
chapter
i
introductions
calls
cards
visiting
beautiful
behavior
gives
a
higher
pleasure
than
statues
or
pictures
it
is
the
finest
of
the
fine
introductions
in
introducing
persons
one
should
be
careful
to
pronounce
each
name
distinctly
when
either
name
is
not
perfectly
understood
a
repetition
of
it
should
be
requested
of
the
person
making
the
introduction
when
introductions
are
given
it
is
the
man
who
should
be
presented
to
the
woman
when
two
women
are
introduced
it
is
the
younger
who
is
presented
to
the
elder
for
example
in
presenting
jones
to
smith
it
is
name
that
is
first
mentioned
the
word
is
preferred
to
informal
introductions
are
given
by
merely
mentioning
the
names
as
smith
jones
and
this
is
ordinarily
sufficient
in
introducing
two
sisters
the
elder
is
and
the
younger
virginia
when
two
women
are
introduced
to
each
other
it
is
not
necessary
for
either
to
rise
a
bow
and
a
smile
from
each
is
sufficient
a
woman
does
not
rise
when
a
man
is
presented
to
her
unless
he
is
very
old
or
is
a
person
of
great
importance
upon
being
introduced
a
married
woman
may
offer
her
hand
to
a
man
but
it
is
not
customary
for
a
young
woman
to
do
so
it
is
the
duty
of
a
man
who
attends
a
private
entertainment
to
have
himself
presented
to
every
member
of
the
family
whom
he
does
not
know
an
introduction
in
the
street
car
is
very
bad
form
one
should
never
forget
that
it
is
difficult
almost
impossible
for
some
people
to
remember
names
and
faces
and
that
such
people
actually
suffer
from
their
inability
to
recognize
and
call
by
name
persons
to
whom
they
may
have
been
introduced
recently
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
one
approach
such
a
person
offer
her
hand
and
say
if
there
is
not
an
immediate
recognition
am
afraid
you
do
not
remember
me
while
the
person
approached
stands
in
agony
and
gradually
makes
an
apology
for
her
poor
memory
and
asks
the
name
one
who
is
truly
polite
who
is
at
all
thoughtful
for
another
feelings
would
not
be
the
cause
of
such
a
scene
she
would
prevent
it
by
saying
am
smith
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
at
luncheon
last
thursday
or
something
of
the
kind
whenever
one
has
reason
to
think
his
name
or
face
may
have
been
forgotten
he
should
make
himself
known
in
approaching
another
person
by
giving
his
name
at
least
calls
a
first
call
ought
to
be
returned
within
a
very
short
time
a
lady
when
receiving
rises
as
her
callers
enter
and
they
immediately
advance
to
pay
their
respects
to
her
before
speaking
to
others
a
man
takes
any
vacant
chair
without
troubling
the
hostess
to
look
after
him
a
man
rises
when
women
with
whom
he
is
talking
rise
to
take
their
leave
women
calling
do
not
rise
unless
those
who
are
leaving
are
friends
older
than
themselves
when
taking
leave
one
ought
to
choose
a
moment
when
there
is
a
lull
in
the
conversation
and
then
take
leave
of
the
hostess
letting
one
bow
include
the
others
in
the
room
one
month
after
the
birth
of
a
child
a
call
of
congratulation
is
made
by
acquaintances
a
call
of
condolence
is
made
within
ten
days
after
the
death
if
the
caller
is
on
intimate
terms
with
the
family
or
within
a
month
if
otherwise
calls
of
congratulation
are
due
to
the
newly
married
and
to
the
parents
who
gave
the
invitations
to
the
marriage
a
man
invited
by
a
woman
to
call
upon
her
can
not
without
great
discourtesy
neglect
to
pay
the
call
within
a
week
a
lady
will
never
keep
a
caller
waiting
without
sending
word
that
she
will
be
in
immediately
one
ought
always
to
return
a
call
but
if
the
acquaintance
is
not
desirable
the
first
call
may
be
the
last
some
women
only
rise
when
their
callers
leave
others
accompany
them
as
far
as
the
door
but
it
is
always
polite
for
a
hostess
to
accompany
her
visitors
to
the
front
door
when
they
take
their
leave
if
there
is
not
a
servant
on
hand
to
open
the
door
for
them
the
best
bred
hostesses
even
go
so
far
as
to
accompany
their
callers
to
the
elevator
in
a
hotel
or
an
of
course
if
one
has
more
than
one
caller
at
a
time
it
would
be
discourteous
to
leave
the
others
to
accompany
one
to
the
door
but
otherwise
it
is
rude
to
permit
a
friend
to
go
to
the
door
alone
and
get
out
as
best
she
may
a
bride
who
is
home
after
november
first
should
make
a
point
of
literally
staying
at
home
for
an
hour
or
two
every
afternoon
during
the
month
of
november
and
the
early
part
of
december
she
should
be
dressed
to
receive
callers
and
should
have
some
dainty
refreshments
ready
to
serve
and
sandwiches
or
cake
after
the
first
week
of
december
the
bride
may
begin
to
return
her
calls
calling
first
on
those
who
first
called
upon
her
and
so
on
when
the
is
a
large
and
formal
function
with
engraved
invitations
and
all
the
accessories
of
hired
waiters
an
elaborate
repast
floral
decorations
as
a
coming
out
a
wedding
reception
or
a
reception
to
celebrate
a
wedding
anniversary
and
other
large
entertainments
of
this
order
is
obligatory
but
an
ordinary
does
not
demand
another
call
for
instance
the
reception
or
a
bride
has
on
her
return
from
her
wedding
trip
or
when
she
is
settled
in
her
new
home
or
a
tea
or
for
which
a
hostess
informally
sends
the
invitations
written
or
engraved
on
her
visiting
cards
and
receives
with
little
ceremony
and
serves
only
a
modest
menu
on
the
contrary
the
hostess
owes
a
return
call
to
all
who
attend
and
only
those
who
were
invited
but
were
unable
to
be
present
are
in
debt
to
her
the
length
of
time
proper
for
one
to
stay
at
an
depends
on
circumstances
it
is
always
a
compliment
to
hostess
to
make
a
long
visit
at
for
it
implies
that
one
is
having
a
pleasant
time
but
nobody
should
stay
long
enough
to
be
a
burden
on
the
hospitality
or
to
detain
her
from
her
other
guests
if
one
finds
that
she
does
not
know
any
one
present
or
if
she
is
not
introduced
to
a
congenial
person
with
whom
she
can
have
a
pleasant
chat
it
would
be
wise
for
her
to
leave
after
a
conventional
ten
or
fifteen
call
the
calling
code
demands
that
soon
after
a
second
caller
is
announced
the
caller
who
was
first
present
shall
take
leave
of
the
hostess
the
reason
for
this
rule
is
obvious
visitor
number
one
has
already
had
a
little
time
of
uninterrupted
with
the
hostess
before
visitor
number
two
appeared
and
he
or
she
should
generously
retire
first
so
that
visitor
number
two
may
have
the
same
privilege
but
while
this
is
the
law
it
depends
somewhat
on
circumstances
whether
it
is
always
carried
out
if
the
first
caller
is
an
intimate
friend
of
the
hostess
and
has
come
to
have
a
long
informal
talk
with
her
and
the
second
caller
is
merely
a
formal
visitor
whose
obvious
intention
is
to
make
a
ceremonious
visit
then
the
first
comer
may
with
perfect
propriety
outstay
the
other
or
if
the
hostess
has
particularly
asked
the
former
to
remain
until
after
the
latter
goes
he
may
do
so
and
of
course
if
the
first
visitor
has
come
for
some
special
reason
and
the
visitor
who
is
announced
later
interrupts
an
important
conversation
which
for
business
or
other
reasons
should
be
continued
the
former
is
naturally
justified
in
transgressing
the
calling
code
all
things
being
equal
however
it
is
the
place
of
the
first
comer
to
be
the
first
goer
and
one
must
have
a
very
good
excuse
for
outstaying
a
caller
who
comes
later
guests
who
are
invited
to
attend
one
large
reception
which
is
given
for
the
express
purpose
of
introducing
a
young
woman
into
society
should
make
a
call
after
the
reception
but
if
the
is
introduced
at
a
series
of
the
callers
need
call
but
once
on
one
of
the
an
invitation
to
any
kind
of
or
reception
demands
a
card
from
a
person
who
is
unable
to
attend
the
function
and
the
card
should
be
sent
on
the
day
of
the
reception
even
if
the
invitation
to
the
function
has
been
already
answered
and
even
if
an
is
in
order
when
one
calls
on
an
acquaintance
who
is
staying
with
a
relative
the
caller
should
ask
for
the
latter
the
hostess
even
if
she
does
not
know
her
and
she
should
leave
one
of
her
own
and
one
of
her
cards
for
her
as
well
as
one
of
each
for
her
friend
it
is
not
obligatory
to
leave
two
of
her
cards
for
each
woman
even
in
the
most
formal
visiting
it
is
optional
whether
one
leaves
one
or
two
cards
probably
the
hostess
will
excuse
herself
altogether
but
the
caller
must
show
her
the
courtesy
of
asking
for
her
in
making
a
call
it
is
proper
to
give
card
to
the
servant
who
opens
the
door
if
it
is
not
a
regular
reception
day
but
on
such
an
occasion
the
card
should
be
left
either
in
the
or
on
the
hall
table
in
passing
out
in
making
a
formal
call
ten
minutes
is
quite
long
enough
to
stay
when
one
is
returning
visits
and
driving
it
would
be
in
very
bad
taste
to
have
the
coachman
get
off
his
box
and
take
the
card
to
the
door
it
is
the
place
to
deliver
her
card
in
person
unless
she
has
a
footman
to
attend
to
it
for
her
in
making
an
evening
call
a
man
should
appear
about
eight
and
remain
an
hour
even
if
his
visit
is
to
the
daughter
he
should
ask
for
her
mother
it
is
quite
proper
when
making
calls
with
a
friend
for
one
to
write
her
name
in
pencil
on
her
card
if
she
has
no
card
of
her
own
with
her
those
women
whose
households
are
most
modest
find
that
the
day
is
a
great
convenience
since
having
a
special
time
for
receiving
friends
all
necessary
arrangements
can
be
made
beforehand
and
no
embarrassing
situations
are
apt
to
occur
when
one
calls
on
a
friend
who
lives
in
a
flat
she
should
immediately
after
ringing
call
through
the
tube
her
name
and
that
of
the
person
she
wishes
to
see
a
man
leaves
his
overcoat
hat
and
stick
in
the
hall
when
making
an
evening
call
when
calling
in
the
afternoon
he
leaves
his
overcoat
in
the
hall
but
carries
his
hat
and
stick
into
the
with
him
when
a
daughter
is
in
the
parlor
and
her
mother
is
entertaining
callers
she
should
rise
when
her
mother
does
in
bidding
them
it
is
very
improper
for
a
young
girl
who
is
ill
to
receive
men
callers
in
her
room
cards
when
an
invitation
to
a
reception
is
sent
in
the
name
of
several
women
a
guest
should
leave
or
send
cards
for
all
whose
names
are
on
the
invitation
a
woman
leaves
with
her
own
cards
the
cards
of
those
members
of
her
family
who
are
unable
to
call
a
young
woman
when
calling
upon
her
friends
with
a
young
man
who
is
a
stranger
to
them
should
send
his
card
with
her
own
to
the
hostess
and
other
women
of
the
household
in
making
formal
calls
a
visitor
invariably
hands
her
cards
to
the
servant
who
opens
the
door
with
a
card
tray
in
her
hand
when
calling
informally
one
may
simply
give
her
name
to
the
servant
at
the
door
but
then
leaves
no
card
later
a
married
woman
when
making
formal
calls
leaves
one
of
her
and
one
of
her
own
cards
for
the
hostess
and
for
every
other
woman
she
asks
for
in
the
house
and
one
of
her
cards
besides
for
the
host
but
while
this
is
the
rule
for
formal
visiting
it
is
quite
permissible
for
a
married
woman
when
calling
on
a
number
of
women
who
reside
in
the
same
house
to
leave
besides
her
own
and
her
for
the
host
and
hostess
only
one
more
of
each
for
all
the
others
in
making
formal
visits
and
subsequent
calls
after
the
first
formal
visit
has
been
made
a
married
woman
need
leave
only
one
of
her
cards
with
her
own
and
in
making
a
call
in
acknowledgment
of
an
invitation
to
an
entertainment
to
which
she
alone
was
invited
as
a
luncheon
should
leave
only
one
of
her
own
the
fashionable
visiting
card
varies
in
size
but
for
a
married
woman
it
is
generally
pure
white
and
very
thin
with
the
name
engraved
in
ordinary
script
for
a
woman
who
lives
in
the
country
it
is
in
good
taste
to
have
the
name
of
her
country
place
put
just
where
if
she
were
in
the
city
her
town
address
would
be
which
is
in
the
left
hand
lower
corner
if
a
woman
receives
cards
for
in
february
and
is
prevented
from
calling
on
any
of
the
tuesdays
she
should
send
her
card
in
an
envelope
either
by
hand
or
mail
on
the
first
tuesday
and
call
on
the
hostess
at
the
earliest
opportunity
on
some
other
day
a
man
should
use
a
card
engraved
as
george
wellington
smith
not
omitting
the
prefix
with
the
address
in
one
corner
if
desired
the
size
of
the
card
varies
from
time
to
time
but
it
is
smaller
than
a
card
the
names
of
mother
and
daughter
or
daughters
are
often
engraved
on
one
card
as
judson
brown
miss
anna
judson
brown
the
misses
the
following
is
the
usual
form
for
an
unmarried
card
miss
may
brown
pine
it
is
quite
proper
for
a
woman
to
retain
her
deceased
name
on
her
visiting
cards
as
john
it
is
equally
proper
for
her
to
use
jane
for
the
purpose
when
a
caller
is
met
by
the
hostess
at
the
door
she
should
drop
her
card
in
the
card
receiver
or
leave
it
on
the
hall
table
on
her
way
out
the
object
of
such
a
card
is
not
to
introduce
people
when
visiting
but
as
a
reminder
of
the
visit
cards
should
be
left
on
the
occasion
of
a
long
absence
of
over
three
months
on
leaving
town
at
the
close
of
the
season
on
leaving
a
neighborhood
where
one
has
resided
for
years
or
where
one
has
resided
for
months
and
sometimes
only
for
weeks
but
not
when
changing
houses
in
the
same
neighborhood
not
even
when
about
to
be
married
unless
future
home
is
to
be
in
another
city
the
words
prendre
signify
to
take
leave
means
vous
which
is
the
french
for
if
you
turning
down
the
corner
of
a
visiting
card
meaning
that
the
call
was
made
in
person
is
no
longer
in
vogue
one
might
leave
her
card
in
person
writing
on
it
kind
inquiries
when
sickness
or
death
has
entered
the
household
of
a
friend
and
thus
show
a
delicate
courtesy
it
is
proper
for
a
hostess
to
shake
hands
with
a
man
visitor
on
his
arrival
and
at
his
departure
it
is
an
evidence
of
very
bad
taste
for
a
young
woman
to
send
wedding
cards
to
a
married
man
without
including
his
name
even
if
she
has
no
acquaintance
whatever
with
her
a
young
girl
who
is
not
does
not
have
visiting
cards
if
she
is
the
oldest
or
only
daughter
and
is
in
society
her
cards
have
upon
them
a
woman
should
never
ask
a
man
formally
calling
to
take
his
hat
or
a
woman
to
lay
aside
her
wraps
a
card
sent
to
an
afternoon
reception
represents
self
it
should
be
sent
either
by
mail
or
messenger
and
never
by
a
friend
to
deposit
upon
the
receiver
with
her
own
card
visiting
a
guest
should
always
ascertain
what
are
the
usual
hours
of
rising
taking
meals
and
retiring
and
then
conform
scrupulously
to
them
guests
should
give
as
little
trouble
as
possible
and
never
apologize
for
the
extra
trouble
their
visit
necessarily
occasions
if
a
ride
drive
or
walk
is
proposed
by
one
of
the
family
entertaining
a
guest
should
acquiesce
as
far
as
her
strength
will
allow
and
do
all
in
her
power
to
seem
pleased
by
the
efforts
made
for
her
entertainment
upon
taking
departure
it
is
reasonably
some
acknowledgment
be
made
of
the
pleasure
that
has
been
afforded
one
it
is
also
proper
upon
returning
home
to
inform

another
question
when
one
receives
only
an
invitation
to
a
church
ceremony
or
merely
an
announcement
card
with
no
card
enclosed
and
does
not
know
the
bride
and
groom
well
enough
to
call
if
the
cards
are
sent
merely
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
because
of
business
relations
or
on
account
of
a
former
intimacy
in
the
families
a
call
does
not
seem
necessary
in
such
cases
one
must
judge
more
or
less
for
herself
and
do
what
seems
natural
if
one
lives
in
a
small
place
and
the
bride
comes
there
as
a
stranger
it
is
generally
the
best
way
to
call
whatever
be
the
form
of
the
cards
received
formal
invitations
to
a
church
wedding
do
not
demand
an
answer
unless
one
is
requested
until
the
day
of
the
ceremony
when
those
unable
to
attend
acknowledge
the
invitation
with
visiting
cards
addressed
to
the
father
and
mother
of
the
bride
or
to
whoever
sends
out
the
invitations
for
the
wedding
invitations
to
a
wedding
reception
and
a
demand
no
other
acknowledgment
than
visiting
cards
sent
on
the
day
of
the
function
by
those
unable
to
attend
a
formal
invitation
to
a
house
wedding
demands
the
same
acknowledgment
as
an
invitation
to
a
church
wedding
in
acknowledging
an
invitation
to
a
wedding
a
single
woman
sends
one
of
her
visiting
cards
in
an
envelope
addressed
to
the
mother
and
father
of
the
bride
on
the
day
of
the
wedding
a
single
man
sends
two
of
his
cards
and
a
married
couple
send
one
of
the
and
two
of
the
cards
to
the
bride
on
her
day
cards
should
be
sent
in
exactly
the
same
way
a
wedding
reception
if
it
takes
place
in
the
evening
demands
full
dress
it
is
very
courteous
to
acknowledge
the
reception
of
a
invitation
it
is
very
bad
form
to
write
on
visiting
card
and
send
it
in
answer
to
a
wedding
invitation
if
one
desires
to
send
her
good
wishes
to
the
bride
then
a
personal
note
would
be
proper
it
is
also
bad
form
to
send
a
visiting
card
with
written
in
one
corner
instead
of
writing
the
proper
note
if
having
accepted
an
invitation
one
changes
her
mind
she
certainly
ought
to
give
some
reason
when
writing
a
note
of
apology
letters
in
writing
letters
and
notes
of
invitation
acceptance
regrets
or
introduction
certain
and
specific
rules
of
etiquette
ordained
by
custom
hold
despotic
sway
and
unless
one
is
acquainted
with
these
he
must
be
considered
by
those
who
are
as
more
or
less
uncultivated
in
addressing
an
envelope
one
surely
ought
to
know
that
the
first
line
of
the
address
should
be
at
or
below
the
middle
of
the
envelope
and
the
address
should
be
written
in
a
plain
hand
devoid
of
flourishes
the
place
for
the
stamp
is
always
the
upper
corner
in
no
way
is
culture
sooner
made
known
than
by
his
manner
of
writing
a
note
or
letter
in
a
formal
business
letter
or
in
one
commencing
or
madam
the
name
of
the
person
addressed
is
put
at
the
end
of
the
letter
in
the
corner
but
it
should
not
be
repeated
if
it
is
used
at
the
head
of
the
letter
the
writing
of
notes
in
the
third
person
is
now
confined
to
notes
of
invitations
acceptance
and
regret
nothing
would
show
greater
ignorance
than
signing
name
to
a
note
written
in
the
third
person
in
addressing
a
clergyman
it
is
customary
to
commence
with
doctors
of
divinity
and
of
medicine
are
thus
distinguished
rev
james
swift
or
dr
swift
latham
or
in
writing
to
servants
it
is
customary
to
begin
thus
mary
bates
white
wishes
when
a
woman
is
writing
to
strangers
who
will
not
know
whether
to
address
her
in
reply
as
or
the
address
of
the
writer
should
be
given
in
full
after
signing
her
letter
as
jane
smith
followed
by
the
direction
or
if
unmarried
the
should
be
placed
in
marks
of
parenthesis
preceding
the
signature
one
should
never
sign
her
name
as
or
the
formal
manner
of
address
in
a
note
or
letter
written
in
the
first
person
is
dear
brown
the
less
formal
is
to
an
intimate
friend
one
may
use
either
is
less
formal
than
dear
mary
and
yet
to
one
who
is
near
the
real
significance
of
the
latter
form
is
very
sweet
and
full
of
tender
meaning
however
there
are
no
rigid
laws
to
regulate
the
correspondence
of
friends
when
a
woman
writes
a
personal
note
to
a
man
no
matter
how
slight
her
acquaintance
may
be
with
him
it
should
begin
dear
ordinary
social
correspondence
when
forwarded
by
the
hand
of
an
adult
socially
equal
with
the
sender
should
not
be
sealed
if
for
some
reason
a
letter
must
be
sealed
then
the
post
or
some
other
method
of
letter
conveyance
should
be
used
the
form
on
an
envelope
is
merely
the
relic
of
an
old
legal
form
that
has
no
especial
significance
nowadays
but
is
put
on
the
envelope
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
it
means
that
the
contents
of
the
envelope
are
for
the
person
whose
name
is
written
on
the
outside
it
is
very
seldom
used
and
is
quite
superfluous
only
letters
of
unmarried
women
and
widows
are
addressed
with
their
baptismal
names
all
letters
of
married
women
should
bear
their
names
as
john
writing
on
the
first
then
on
the
third
then
crosswise
on
the
second
and
fourth
pages
of
a
letter
facilitates
the
reading
and
is
in
perfectly
good
form
it
is
very
bad
taste
for
a
wife
to
assume
his
title
an
invitation
addressed
to
them
should
read
and
one
should
not
write
john
brown
lottie
smith
because
one
is
not
born
with
a
christian
name
instead
one
would
write
john
brown
the
use
of
perfumed
stationery
is
not
general
nor
is
it
in
good
taste
any
letter
of
congratulation
received
even
though
it
be
from
a
person
with
whom
one
has
only
a
slight
acquaintance
requires
an
answer
no
matter
how
fond
a
young
girl
may
feel
of
a
man
whom
she
has
known
for
years
any
letters
when
trouble
comes
to
his
family
should
be
addressed
to
his
wife
and
not
to
him
the
fashion
that
obtains
with
reference
to
placing
the
date
on
a
letter
is
to
place
it
in
the
upper
corner
on
a
note
it
is
usually
placed
in
the
lower
corner
a
young
girl
who
receives
letters
from
a
man
at
the
without
the
knowledge
of
her
mother
is
doing
something
wrong
which
in
time
she
will
certainly
regret
and
which
it
is
equally
certain
will
result
in
trouble
it
is
not
in
the
best
taste
to
write
letters
of
friendship
on
the
typewriter
but
it
will
always
be
excused
in
the
busy
woman
letters
of
introduction
letters
of
introduction
are
to
be
regarded
as
certificates
of
respectability
and
esteem
and
should
only
be
given
by
friends
of
the
person
introduced
and
to
friends
they
should
be
brief
and
carefully
worded
intimating
the
mutual
pleasure
that
one
feels
the
acquaintance
will
confer
but
not
complimenting
the
bearer
so
openly
that
he
will
feel
embarrassed
in
delivering
the
letter
such
letters
are
left
unsealed
there
is
no
greater
insult
than
to
treat
a
letter
of
introduction
with
indifference
a
person
thus
introduced
ought
to
be
called
upon
at
once
and
shown
any
other
little
attention
within
power
in
england
letters
of
introduction
are
called
to
in
england
the
party
holding
a
letter
of
introduction
never
takes
it
himself
but
sends
it
with
his
card
on
the
continent
the
reverse
is
the
fashion
in
america
the
english
custom
prevails
though
where
a
young
man
has
a
letter
to
one
many
years
his
senior
or
to
one
who
is
to
aid
him
in
some
enterprise
he
takes
it
himself
at
once
a
letter
of
introduction
should
be
somewhat
like
the
following
dear
barnes
note
will
introduce
to
you
my
friend
charles
smith
whom
i
know
you
will
be
as
glad
to
meet
as
he
will
be
glad
to
meet
smith
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
any
kindness
you
may
be
able
to
show
him
will
be
very
much
appreciated
by
yours
martin
before
giving
a
letter
of
introduction
one
should
be
certain
that
the
persons
introduced
will
be
congenial
to
each
other
such
a
letter
puts
a
certain
obligation
on
the
person
to
whom
it
is
addressed
he
will
be
obliged
to
show
the
bearer
some
attention
and
hospitality
it
is
therefore
not
right
to
make
the
demand
of
a
friend
unless
one
is
certain
that
the
acquaintanceship
will
compensate
him
for
the
trouble
he
may

given
at
seven

the

naturally

usually
consist

the

a

of
the

who
helps
himself
as
a
rule
the
woman
at
the
right
of
the
host
or
the
eldest
woman
should
be
served
first
as
soon
as
a
course
is

the

are
promptly
removed
and
the
next
course
is
served

they
should
be
half
full
of
warm
water
with
a
bit
of
lemon
floating
in
it
when
all
have
finished

the
hostess
gives
the
signal
by
pushing
back
her
chair
that
dinner
is
ended
and
the
guests
repair
to
the
the
oldest
leading
and
the
youngest

the

into
the
library
or
seemingly
one
should
arrive
at
the
house
where
one
is
invited
to
a
dinner
or
a
luncheon
at
exactly
the
hour
mentioned
in
the
invitation
but
the
proper
thing
at
a
formal
function
is
to
get
to
the
house
ten
minutes
after
the
hour
of
the
meal
and
to
be
announced
in
the
five
minutes
later
the
host
with
the
guest
of
honor
leads

way
into
the
at
a
dinner
at
a
luncheon
the
hostess
leads
the
way
alone
or
with
one
of
the
guests
fifteen
minutes
is
the
longest
time
required
to
wait
for
a
tardy
guest
when
the
dinner
hour
was
understood
as
it
always
should
be
if
the
hostess
thinks
the
visitor
has
no
acquaintances
in
the
room
she
introduces
her
to
two
or
three
persons
who
are
near
her
and
then
counting
on
her
knowledge
of
the
customs
of
society
she
will
feel
quite
sure
that
her
guest
will
enjoy
herself
a
hostess
should
never
reprove
a
servant
before
a
guest
as
it
is
unpleasant
for
all
concerned
and
by
passing
over
the
annoyance
herself
it
may
escape
the
attention
of
others
no
accident
must
seem
to
disturb
a

no

embarrass
her
at
formal

is
detailed
to

luncheons
are
usually
given
between
the
hours
of
one
and
two
in
the
afternoon
and
to
them
women
only
are
invited
the
menu
is
lighter
than

generally
consists
of
sherbets

scalloped
oysters

as
best
suits

breakfasts
the
difference
between
a
breakfast
and
a
luncheon
is
very
slight
on
the
invitation
the
word
breakfast
is
used
instead
of
luncheon
and
the
hour
is
earlier
than
for
a
luncheon
also
men
and
woman
may
meet
together
for
a
breakfast
and
therefore
a
few
more
solid
courses
are
advisable
otherwise
one
may
be
guided
entirely
in
giving
the
entertainment
by
the
rules
which
apply
to
a
luncheon
teas
a
tea
is
the
simplest
and
easiest
kind
of
an
entertainment
to
give
for
the
only
essential
requisites
for
its
success
are
prettily
arranged
with
as
many
flowers
as
one
can
afford
a
gracious
hostess
who
stands
during
the
hours
of
the
function
to
receive
her
guests
and
is
properly
dressed
in
a
becoming
house
dress
a
few
other
women
who
also
receive
in
pretty
dresses
and
a
dainty
tea
table
which
may
be
presided
over
by
a
woman
friend
or
two
of
the
hostess
it
is
only
necessary
to
serve
a
modest
menu
of
tea
chocolate
or
bouillon
assorted
sandwiches
fancy
cakes
and
bonbons
the
other
factors
to
the
success
are
pleasant
weather
and
well
trained
servants
who
may
assist
in
serving
the
tea
and
are
alert
to
open
and
close
the
door
for
the
guests
at
a
formal
function
of
any
kind
the
guests
leave
their
wraps
in
where
one
or
more
maids
should
be
on
hand
to
assist
women
in
their
and
a
man
to
perform
the
same
services
in
the
but
at
a
small
tea
where
as
a
rule
the
guests
do
not
remove
their
street
wraps
it
is
only
necessary
to
have
a
maid
in
the
entrance
hall
to
be
ready
if
called
on
to
do
any
service
it
is
not
customary
to
offer
refreshments
to
casual
evening
callers
but
if
one
has
a
regular
evening
for
receiving
she
may
have
a
tea
table
in
the
and
serve
tea
chocolate
sandwiches
cake
as
in
entertaining
on
the
afternoon
of
a
receptions
on
the
day
of
the
reception
the
hostess
with
her
assistants
should
receive
the
guests
standing
at
the
door
of
the
the
refreshment
tables
should
be
spread
in
the

prettily
decorated
with
flowers
candles
in
candelabra
or
candlesticks
dishes
of
bonbons
and
cakes
plates
of
sandwiches
and
platters
of
salad
a
bouillon
urn
may
stand
at
one
end
of
the
table
with
cups
and
coffee
may
be
served
from
the
other
end
all
that
is
necessary
for
the
menu
is
bouillon
easily
prepared
in
the
house
from
canned
bouillon
jellied
tongue
chicken
salad
and
sandwiches
ices
and
cake
fruit
and
candies
coffee
and
lemonade
will
suffice
for
beverages
if
one
can
afford
to
have
a
few
pieces
of
music
so
much
the
better
the
musicians
should
play
from
some
hidden
nook
one
or
two
servants
in
the
and
one
to
open
and
shut
the
front
door
will
be
all
that
is
necessary
dancing
parties
for
the
form
of
invitation
refer
to
chapter
ii
in
selecting
a
company
for
a
dancing
party
the
hostess
will
naturally
choose
only
those
who
dance
and
she
should
see
as
far
as
possible
that
all
the
women
are
provided
with
partners
it
is
better
to
dance
first
with
one
acquaintance
and
then
with
another
rather
than
to
make
self
conspicuous
by
giving
a
great
number
of
dances
to
one
man
a
man
gives
the
first
and
last
dances
to
his
partner
of
the
evening
no
man
should
invite
a
young
woman
to
attend
a
dress
affair
without
providing
a
carriage
for
her
when
the
party
is
small
and
informal
it
is
allowable
to
go
on
the
at
the
end

when
a
wedding
takes
place
in
a
church
that
has
but
one
entrance
the
customary
way
for
the
bridal
procession
to
enter
is
for
the
groom
and
best
man
to
walk
in
just
behind
the
minister
a
little
before
the
others
and
to
take
their
places
at
the
altar
then
the
ushers
enter
walking
two
by
two
then
the
bridesmaids
in
the
same
order
then
the
maid
of
honor
alone
and
last
the
bride
on
her
arm
the
family
enter
the
church
a
few
minutes
before
the
minister
and
the
groom
and
bridal
party
a
bride
goes
up
to
the
altar
with
her
veil
over
her
face
but
comes
down
with
it
thrown
back
it
is
the
duty
of
the
maid
of
honor
to
throw
it
back
immediately
after
the
ceremony
is
ended
when
the
mother
gives
her
away
at
a
church
ceremony
she
usually
walks
up
the
aisle
with
the
bride
after
she
has
given
her
to
the
groom
she
steps
quietly
and
unescorted
to
the
front
pew
where
she
stays
during
the
remainder
of
the
service
the
bride
may
walk
up
the
aisle
with
an
attendant
instead
of
with
her
mother
who
in
this
case
steps
from
her
seat
in
the
front
pew
to
the
chancel
when
the
time
comes
for
her
to
officiate
and
steps
back
to
her
seat
afterwards
the
bride
and
the
groom
should
stand
at
the
wedding
reception
until
they
have
received
the
congratulations
of
all
present
then
together
they
should
walk
into
the
room
where
the
breakfast
is
to
be
served
the
others
follow
as
they
please
with
the
exception
of
the
parents
on
both
sides
the
father
usually
escorts
the
mother
and
it
is
not
the
custom
for
a
bride
to
remove
her
gloves
at
the
wedding
the
inside
seam
of
the
ring
finger
of
the
glove
should
be
ripped
beforehand
and
when
the
time
comes
for
the
ring
to
be
put
on
the
bride
merely
slips
off
this
glove
finger
and
puts
it
back
again
after
the
ring
is
on
her
finger
at
no
wedding
service
is
it
proper
for
the
bride
to
enter
the
church
alone
at
a
church
or
house
wedding
where
the
bride
walks
up
the
aisle
with
her
sister
acting
as
the
maid
of
honor
instead
of
with
a
gentleman
escort
she
need
not
take
the
arm
of
her
attendant
as
both
the
ladies
will
look
more
graceful
if
walking
separately
the
maid
of
honor
should
carry
a
bouquet
and
the
bride
a
bouquet
or
bible
at
a
home
wedding
the
bride
enters
the
room
on
the
arm
of
her
father
with
a
short
dress
she
would
not
wear
a
veil
the
wearing
of
gloves
at
an
informal
wedding
is
entirely
a
matter
of
taste
recently
at
several
large
weddings
they
were
omitted
by
the
entire
bridal
party
the
prettiest
way
to
make
an
aisle
for
the
bridal
party
at
a
house
wedding
is
for
four
children
to
enter
the
room
where
the
ceremony
will
be
just
before
the
bridal
party
comes
in
and
separate
the
guests
into
two
groups
by
stretching
two
pieces
of
white
ribbon
the
length
of
the
room
a
child
stands
at
each
end
of
the
two
pieces
of
ribbon
holding
it
while
the
bridal
party
walks
up
between
them
and
during
the
service
ushers
may
hold
the
ribbons
instead
of
the
children
or
the
ends
may
be
fastened
around
plants
which
are
placed
at
the
requisite
points
where
there
is
no
side
door
through
which
the
groom
and
best
man
may
enter
the
room
at
a
house
wedding
they
come
in
by
the
principal
door
just
before
the
bridal
party
and
just
after
the
minister
it
is
not
customary
for
the
men
at
a
wedding
party
to
kiss
the
bride
that
is
a
liberty
taken
only
by
the
immediate
members
of
the
family
a
bride
if
she
wishes
may
omit
the
bridal
veil
but
she
should
then
wear
a
dainty
bonnet
or
picture
hat
the
ushers
and
best
men
are
invited
by
the
bridegroom
if
the
church
wedding
is
a
full
dress
one
followed
by
an
evening
reception
it
is
proper
to
wear
an
evening
gown
if
it
is
in
the
daytime
a
handsome
visiting
dress
and
pretty
bonnet
are
proper
at
a
daytime
wedding
the
guests
seldom
remove
their
bonnets
although
of
course
heavy
wraps
are
frequently
laid
aside
at
an
evening
affair
one
goes
in
full
dress
without
anything
on
head
the
ushers
present
the
guests
to
the
bridal
party
the
bridesmaids
are
spoken
to
by
the
people
they
know
but
it
is
not
necessary
that
they
should
be
addressed
by
everybody
a
bride
may
wear
her
wedding
dress
after
her
wedding
day
as
much
or
as
little
as
she
chooses
for
the
sake
of
sentiment
many
brides
like
to
preserve
their
wedding
dresses
intact
to
hand
down
to
future
generations
but
a
girl
who
has
to
consider
economy
can
not
afford
to
consider
sentiment
and
often
the
wedding
dress
is
converted
into
a
low
dinner
and
evening
gown
soon
after
the
wedding
day
a
bride
may
with
perfect
propriety
wear
her
wedding
dress
to
the
reception
given
her
after
her
wedding
by
the
mother
of
course
she
will
wear
it
just
as
it
was
when
she
was
married
high
in
the
neck
unless
the
reception
takes
place
in
the
evening
and
demands
evening
dress
when
according
to
the
conventions
it
must
be
cut
low
a
bridegroom
is
always
expected
to
furnish
the
bouquets
that
the
bride
bridesmaids
and
all
the
attendants
carry
at
the
wedding
he
should
learn
from
the
bride
the
flowers
she
wishes
and
should
order
them
several
days
before
the
wedding
so
that
they
may
be
ready
at
the
house
when
the
bridesmaids
meet
there
to
go
together
to
the
church
or
to
the
place
where
the
ceremony
is
held
besides
furnishing
these
bouquets
the
groom
provides
the
ushers
and
best
men
with
their
and
gives
them
also
some
small
souvenir
and
if
he
wishes
a
bachelor
dinner
or
supper
a
day
or
two
before
the
wedding
there
are
no
wedding
luncheons
nowadays
every
entertainment
of
the
kind
up
to
two
is
called
a
breakfast
and
when
it
takes
place
in
the
afternoon
or
evening
it
is
called
a
reception
wedding
gifts
the
idea
that
a
wedding
invitation
necessitates
a
present
has
sensibly
enough
gone
out
of
fashion
and
only
those
who
are
bound
by
ties
of
blood
or
close
friendship
have
the
privilege
of
sending
a
gift
to
the
bride
presents
should
be
sent
as
soon
after
receiving
the
invitations
as
possible
all
wedding
gifts
even
from
friends
of
the
groom
who
may
never
have
met
the
bride
are
sent
to
the
bride
and
if
marked
they
should
be
engraved
with
the
initials
or
monogram
of
the
maiden
name
or
they
may
have
her
name
in
full
wedding
presents
should
be
acknowledged
by
the
in
a
short
personal
note
which
should
be
written
and
sent
immediately
on
receipt
of
the
present
when
several
friends
combine
in
giving
a
present
to
the
bride
she
should
write
a
letter
of
thanks
to
each
one
separately
sending
the
letters
by
post
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
open
a
gift
in
the
presence
of
the
giver
and
express
pleasure
and
gratitude
on
the
spot

it
is

to
do
so

to

the
fruit

noble
natures
and
of
loyal
conversation
the
late
george
ripley
was
wont
to
say
that
the
secret
of
being
agreeable
in
conversation
was
to
be
honorable
to
the
ideas
of
others
he
affirmed
that
some
people
only
half
listened
to
you
because
they
were
considering
even
while
you
spoke
with
what
fine
words
what
wealth
of
wit
they
should
reply
and
they
began
to
speak
almost
before
your
sentence
had
died
upon
your
lips
these
people
he
said
might
be
brilliant
witty
dazzling
but
never
could
they
be
agreeable
you
do
not
love
to
talk
to
them
you
feel
that
they
are
impatient
for
their
turn
to
come
and
that
they
have
no
hospitality
towards
your
of
that
gentle
friendliness
which
asks
your
idea
and
makes
much
of
it
this
want
of
hospitality
to
other
ideas
often
has
its
root
in
egotism
but
it
is
equally
apt
to
be
the
growth
of
a
secret
want
of
a
fear
that
one
will
not
be
ready
to
take
own
part
well
uneasy
which
makes
real
sympathetic
attention
to
the
ideas
of
others
impossible
agreeability
readiness
in
conversation
tact
and
graciousness
of
manner
are
great
aids
to
popularity
to
possess
these
qualities
one
must
have
marked
consideration
for
others
and
be
ever
ready
to
manifest
it
one
should
also
be
ready
to
recall
faces
and
names
though
one
has
but
few
facts
and
ideas
to
draw
upon
she
may
still
by
making
sufficient
effort
become
a
fair
conversationalist
if
one
despair
in
this
direction
she
may
at
least
train
herself
to
become
an
interesting
listener
and
she
will
be
surprised
to
find
how
popular
she
will
be
for
of
the
world
like
to
talk
while
to
listen
intelligently
is
a
great
talent
the
good
listener
by
her
evident
interest
in
and
sympathetic
attention
to
the
matter
of
conversation
brings
out
all
that
is
best
in
the
one
with
whom
she
talks
diffident
people
forget
their
shyness
in
her
presence
and
leave
her
with
the
comfortable
and
novel
conviction
that
they
have
after
all
acquitted
themselves
rather
well
no
person
would
be
guilty
of
the
gross
rudeness
of
picking
up
a
book
or
magazine
and
it
while
pretending
to
pay
heed
to
the
talk
of
a
friend
the
assurance
am
only
looking
at
the
pictures
of
this
magazine
not
reading
and
i
hear
every
word
you
say
is
no
palliation
of
the
offence
the
speaker
would
be
justified
in
refusing
to
continue
the
conversation
until
the
pictures
had
been
properly
studied
if
a
speech
is
worth
hearing
it
is
worthy
of
respectful
and
earnest
attention
no
one
should
ever
monopolize
the
conversation
unless
he
wishes
to
win
for
himself
the
name
of
a
bore
a
and
finely
cultured
person
proclaims
himself
by
the
simplicity
and
terseness
of
his
language
in
conversation
all
provincialisms
affectations
of
foreign
accents
mannerisms
exaggerations
and
slang
are
detestable
flippancy
is
as
much
an
evidence
of
as
is
the
perpetual
smile
the
wandering
eye
the
vacant
stare
or
the
mouth
of
the
man
who
is
preparing
to
break
in
upon
the
conversation
interruption
of
the
speech
of
others
is
a
great
sin
against
good
breeding
anecdotes
should
be
sparsely
introduced
into
a
conversation
lest
they
become
stale
repartee
must
be
indulged
in
with
moderation
puns
are
considered
vulgar
by
many
in
addressing
persons
with
titles
one
ought
always
to
add
the
name
as
do
you
think

the
great
secret
of
talking
well
is
to
adapt
conversation
skillfully
to
the
hearers
in
a
conversation
it
is
extremely
to
drop
the
voice
to
a
whisper
or
to
converse
on
private
matters
one
should
never
try
to
hide
the
lips
in
talking
by
putting
up
the
hand
or
a
fan
one
should
avoid
long
conversations
in
society
with
members
of
his
own
family
if
an
unfinished
conversation
is
continued
after
the
entrance
of
a
visitor
its
import
should
be
explained
to
him
though
bores
find
their
account
in
speaking
ill
or
well
of
themselves
it
is
the
characteristic
of
a
gentleman
that
he
never
speaks
of
himself
at
all
la
buryere
says
great
charm
of
conversation
consists
less
in
the
display
of
own
wit
and
intelligence
than
in
the
power
to
draw
forth
the
resources
of
others
he
who
leaves
one
after
a
long
conversation
pleased
with
himself
and
the
part
has
taken
in
the
discourse
will
be
the
warmest
in
society
the
man
is
uncivil
there
are
many
persons
who
commence
speaking
before
they
know
what
they
are
going
to
say
the
world
which
never
misses
an
opportunity
of
being
severe
declares
them
to
be
foolish
and
destitute
of
brains
he
who
knows
the
world
will
not
be
too
bashful
he
who
knows
himself
will
not
be
imprudent
there
is
no
surer
sign
of
vulgarity
than
the
perpetual
boasting
of
fine
things
at
home
one
should
be
careful
how
freely
he
offers
advice
if
one
keeps
silent
sometimes
upon
subjects
of
which
he
is
known
to
be
a
judge
his
silence
when
from
ignorance
will
not
discover
him
one
should
not
argue
a
point
when
it
is
possible
to
avoid
it
but
when
he
does
argue
he
should
do
so
in
a
gentlemanly
and
dispassionate
manner
one
should
never
notice
any
mistakes
in
the
language

others
chaperonage
the
foreign
custom
that

young

condemns
herself

is

to

necessarily

that
in

broad

a
stranger
visiting
new

might
readily
and
innocently
make
a
mistake
of
this
nature

at

many
parts

allow
this
to
be
done
with
the
smiling
consent
of
good
society
but
in
eastern
cities
it
is
considered
a
violation
of
good
form
and
for
the
comfort
if
not
the
convenience
of
the
girl
considering
it
had
better
be
ranked
among
the
lost
privileges
upon
which
social
evolution
may
look
back
with
fond
regret
it
is
always
wisest
when
a
number
of
young
people
are
to
have
a
party
to
ask
two
or
three
married
women
to
be
present
not
only
for
sake
but
because
there
will
then
be
no
danger
of
anything
unwished
for
happening
inasmuch
as
it
is
the
duty
of
the
chaperones
to
make
all
social
entertainments
smooth
and
pleasant
when
it
is
necessary
for
a
girl
to
pay
long
visits
to
a
office
she
should
be
accompanied
either
by
her
mother
or
some
woman
relative
or
maid
the
etiquette
of
chaperonage
is
much
less
strict
for
a
young
widow
than
for
an
unmarried
girl
of
the
same
age
but
it
is
important
and
in
good
taste
for
a
woman
who
is
a
widow
to
be
very
quiet
and
inconspicuous
in
all
she
does
giving
by
her
behavior
no
opportunity
for
criticism
marriage
a
young
own
safety
as
regards
her
present
and
future
happiness
demands
that
she
receive
attentions
from
only
the
best
of
young
men
of
whom
her
reason
would
approve
if
the
acquaintance
should
lead
to
more
than
acquaintance
parents
should
carefully
watch
the
young
men
who
frequent
their
houses
in
order
to
see
that
undesirable
intimacies
are
not
formed
with
their
daughters
for
friendships
and
intimacies
soon
lead
to
love
many
a
girl
feeling
convinced
that
she
had
loved
unwisely
has
entered
upon
the
married
state
with
heart
and
reason
at
variance
when
she
might
have
given
up
the
acquaintance
in
the
beginning
of
it
very
easily
the
most
perfect
reserve
in
courtship
even
in
cases
of
the
most
ardent
attachment
is
indispensable
to
the
confidence
and
trust
of
married
life
to
come
all
public
display
of
devotion
should
be
avoided
for
it
tends
to
lessen
mutual
respect
and
it
makes
the
actors
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
or
others
it
is
quite
possible
for
a
man
to
show
every
conceivable
attention
to
the
one
to
whom
he
is
engaged
and
yet
to
avoid
committing
the
slightest
offence
against
delicacy
or
good
taste
it
is
quite
possible
for
a
man
to
show
attention
and
even
assiduity
up
to
a
certain
point
without
becoming
a
lover
and
it
is
equally
possible
for
the
girl
to
let
it
be
seen
that
he
is
not
disagreeable
to
her
without
actually
encouraging
him
no
man
likes
to
be
refused
and
no
man
of
tact
will
risk
a
refusal
long
engagements
are
usually
entered
into
by
people
who
are
quite
young
but
who
for
some
reason
can
not
marry
as
the
years
go
on
their
tastes
may
change
and
yet
each
may
feel
that
honor
binds
the
one
to
the
other
the
woman
chosen
by
a
man
when
he
is

seldom
the
woman

would
chose

he
is
forty
when
people
marry
young
they
grow
accustomed
to
each
other
and
oddly
enough
they
grow
to
be
alike
but
during
a
long
engagement
their
tastes
are
apt
to
change
and
the
result
is
apt
to
be
anything
but
a
happy
one
of
course
there
are
exceptions
but
generalizing
the
long
engagement
is
to
be
feared
domestic
etiquette
and

etiquette
is
a
comprehensive
term
and
its
observances
are
nowhere
more
to
be
desired
than
in
the
domestic
circle
if
husbands
and
wives
generally
would
render
each
other
half
of
the
little
attentions
they
lavished
upon
each
other
before
marriage
their
mutual
happiness
would
be
more
than
doubled
a
wife
should
never
let
her
husband
have
cause
to
complain
that
she
is
more
agreeable
abroad
than
at
home
nor
see
her
negligent
of
dress
and
manners
at
home
when
it
is
the
reverse
in
company
if
unhappily
any
misunderstandings
or
annoyances
occur
between
husband
and
wife
it
is
and
unjust
for
either
to
repeat
them
to
a
third
person
faithful
unto
death
in
all
things
should
be
the
motto
of
both
husband
and

and

peculiarities
their
effort
to
attain
if
a
girl
discovers
very
soon
after
her
marriage
that
she
has
made
a
mistake
it
is
wisest
for
her
to
make
the
best
of
it
she
should
look
for
all
that
is
good
in
her
husband
and
try
to
forget
that
which
she
dislikes
there
are
times
when
a
legal
separation
is
necessary
but
when
people
marry
they
marry
for
better
or
for
worse
and
if
unfortunately
it
should
be
for
worse
even
that
does
not
release
them
from
the
solemn
vows
which
they
have
taken
it
is
not
in
good
taste
for
a
husband
and
wife
to
call
each
other
by
endearing
names
in
the
presence
of
others
a
man
has
no
right
whatever
to
open
his
mail
but
a
woman
should
not

the
best
advice
to
all
girls
upon
the
subject
must
be
not
to
be
overdressed
nor
yet
to
be
careless
in
the
matter
they
should
attire
themselves
according
to
their
circumstances
and
should
above
all
things
avoid
all
extremes
of
fashion
as
well
as
all
eccentricities
of
style
only
quiet
colors
should
be
worn
either
to
church
or
on
the
street
and
wherever
girls
go
they
should
endeavor
to
be
unconscious
of
their
personal
appearance
the
woman
who
is
overdressed
at
an
afternoon
reception
is
much
more
uncomfortable
than
she
who
is
gowned
with
the
simplicity
of
a
quaker
a
well
fitting
wool
gown
a
becoming
bonnet
a
fresh
pair
of
gloves
and
one
is
suitably
dressed
as
a
caller
a
girl
of
fourteen
should
not
wear
her
hair
done
up
and
her
gown
should
come
just
below
her
ankles
it
is
not
in
good
taste
for
a
young
girl
to
wear
diamond
rings
if
she
is
fortunate
enough
to
possess
them
let
her
keep
them
carefully
until
she
is
older
and
then
she
may
wear
them
with
perfect
propriety

occasions

neatness
in
a
dress
is
one
of
the
first
requisites
to
dress
well
requires
good
taste
good
sense
and
refinement
the
most
appropriate
and
becoming
dress
is
that
which
so
harmonizes
with
the
figure
that
the
apparel
is
unobserved
a
hostess
should
be
careful
not

her
guests
when
going
out
one
should
consider
the
sort
of
company
she
is
likely
to
meet
and
should
dress
accordingly
the
idea
that
makes

is
a
very
false
one

a

make
or
select
rather
his
dress
and
is
judged
somewhat
in

with
that
selection
at
a

dress
as

not

ice
may

chosen

in
keeping
on

wears
gloves
when

and
removes
them
just
before

just
after
entering
the
parlor

gloves
may
be
worn
at
all
hours
of

ones
are
proper
in

evening
when
calling

at
any
place
of
amusement

matter
how
long

are

should
be
entirely
taken
off
at

and
be
resumed
again
upon
returning
to
the
or
after
using
the
finger
bowls
and
before
arising
from
the
feast
to
wear
gloves
while
playing
cards

an
affectation
of
elegance
street
etiquette
a
man
offers
his
right
arm
if
either
to

woman
on

also
in
the
house
that
she
may
have
her
right

gallantry
assign

place
where
it
is
for
her
greatest
convenience
and
that
is
undeniably
on
the
right
of
the
man
the
rule
for
giving
the
left
arm
was
held
good
in
those
days
when
it
was
necessary
for
men
to
pass
to
the
left
thus
keeping
the
free
for
or
for
the
protection
of
the
women
but
now
the
passing
is
all
to
the
right
in
walking
with
a
woman
a
man
chooses
the
outer
side
without
any
regard
as
to
its
being
either
the
right
or
the
left
in
walking
with
two
women
he
chooses
the
outer
side
also
and
never
walks
between
them
a
man
walking
with
a
woman
returns
a
bow
made
to
her
lifting
his
hat
although
the
one
bowing
is
a
stranger
to
him
ladies
do
not
talk
or
call
across
the
street

should
not
smoke

walking

frequented

they
can
not
remove

from

refuse
to
return
the
bow
of
any
respectable
woman
if

does
not
wish
to
recognize
her

must

her
it
is
much
less
rude
for
women
to
return
a
recognition
coldly
and
upon
the
next
occasion
to
turn
away
or
to
avoid
a
meeting

precede

him

roof

acquainted

travel
all

if
she
conducts
herself
quietly

as

should
she
will
receive
all

respect
at

it

perhaps
a

have
a

with

even
if

is
not
possible

be
put
in

of

one

are
made
she
either
gives

tells

for
her
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
go
into

register

of
some
length
a
letter
of
credit
is
more
convenient

can
be
obtained
from
any
having

connections
in

countries
traveling
in
the
carriages
is
very
comfortable
in
others
it
is
not
in
italy
a
traveler
can
be
comfortable
only
by
traveling
in
france
is
not
bad
and
in
germany
and
great
britain
it
is
perfectly
comfortable
and
preferable
to
in
many
respects
a
rush
and
scramble
at
a
railway
ticket
office
is
only
carried
on
by
people
or
by
those
who
appear
so
at
the
time
if
a
woman
offers
to
seat
herself
beside
a
man
he
should
rise
at
once
and
give
her
the
choice
of
seats
no
real
gentlemen
would
be
unmindful
of
the
comfort
and
convenience
of
women
while
traveling
from
a
selfish
motive
in
the
cars
one
has
no
right
to
keep
a
window
open
if
the
current
of
air
thus
produced
annoys
another
a
woman
should
always
be
careful
to
thank
a
person
for
any
little
attention
he
may
bestow
upon
her
while
traveling
bicycling
as
to
rules
of
politeness
for
bicyclers
one
who
is
a
true
lady
will
show
herself
to
be
one
as
surely
when
riding
a
wheel
as
at
any
other
time
not
only
by
her
costume
which
will
be
unobtrusive
in
color
cut
and
adjustment
but
by
her
manner
which
will
be
even
more
quiet
and
than
usual
as
she
well
knows
that
by
mounting
a
wheel
she
makes
herself
more
or
less
conspicuous
it
goes
without
saying
that
she
will
not
ride
fast
enough
to
attract
undue
attention
that
she
will
not
chew
gum
and
that
she
will
not
allow
advances
from
strangers
who
may
like
herself
be
on
a
wheel
and
to
all
appearances
may
be
gentlemen
neither
will
she
ride
off
alone
after
dark
nor
take
long
rides
in
the
evening
attended
only
by
an
escort
in
the
daytime
when
out
only
with
a
man
friend
she
will
avoid
stopping
to
rest
under
the
trees
and
in
out
of
the
way
places
too
much
care
can
not
be
taken
especially
by
young
girls
as
to
appearances
their
very
innocence
and
ignorance
lays
them
open
to
criticism
telephoning
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
but
seldom
make
use
of
the
telephone
and
consequently
feel
more
or
less
ill
at
ease
when
attempting
to
use
one
and
also
for
those
who
from
ignorance
of
the
first
laws
of
politeness
or
who
from
thoughtlessness
ignore
them
a
few
hints
upon
the
subject
may
not
come
amiss
it
is
after
having
called
up
and
been
given
the
number
requested
that
one
often
stands
in
need
of
no
small
amount
of
tact
and
good
breeding
as
well
as
of
some
idea
of
the
best
method
of
procedure
when
there
are
several
different
persons
using
the
same
line
two
or
three
of
them
may
mistake
the
call
for
theirs
and
all
rush
to
the
telephone
at
once
if
at
all
stupid
or
lacking
in
politeness
they
will
make
it
quite
unpleasant
for
each
other
the
one
entitled
to
speak
should
politely
inquire
for
the
one
for
whom
she
has
called
at
the
telephone
also
giving
her
own
name
as
the
one
delivering
the
message
if
this
does
not
suffice
to
enlighten
those
who
sometimes
keep
calling
without
waiting
to
learn
if
they
are
the
ones
desired
the
one
talking
should
again
announce
herself
and
the
name
of
the
one
to
whom
she
wishes
to
speak
then
occasionally
even
while
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
some
one
will
break
in
with
a
is
it
do
you
want
which
is
quite
distracting
if
one
can
gain
a
hearing
in
no
other
way
it
is
well
to
say
me
i
hold
the
if
this
does
not
bring
order
out
of
chaos
one
should
ring
off
and
call
again
one
should
be
careful
not
to
call
up
friends
at
inconvenient
hours
and
when
one
is
notified
by
a
servant
or
otherwise
that
someone
the
name
being
given
is
at
the
telephone
wishing
to
speak
with
her
she
should
certainly
be
as
expeditious
as
possible
in
replying
for
by
holding
the
wire
she
is
inconveniencing
others
as
well
as
the
one
who
is
waiting
for
her
no
lady
needs
to
be
warned
against
speaking
discourteously
under
any
circumstances
to
the
telephone
assistants
at
the
central
office
it
is
in
these
little
things
that
one
shows
herself
to
be
or
not
none
of
course
but
the
most
informal
of
invitations
can
be
delivered
by
telephone
servants
should
be
taught
always
to
answer
the
telephone
politely
and
intelligently
when
answering
a
servant
should
say
whose
residence
it
is
if
asked
not
by
giving
the
family
name
as
but
as
smith
and
then
if
asked
who
is
at
the
instrument
she
should
reply
or
individual
manners
and
ordinary
polite
or
impolite
forms
of
address
are

made
of

arranged
so
that
the

all
meet
in

while
the
points
are
directed
towards
the
guests
the
effect
is
of
a
great
daisy
a
pretty
conceit
for
decorating
a
dainty
table
is
to
cluster
a
number
of
small
palms
together
in

of

around

of
loose
bunches
of
pinks
roses

tie
these
with
wide
pink

down

menu
cards
are
not
ordinarily
used
at
any
but
the
most
formal
kind
of
an
entertainment
they
are
always
seen
at
large
functions
public
dinners
which
are
usually
given
in
a
hotel
or
restaurant
but
in
a
private
house
individual
menu
cards
whether
at
a
dinner
or
a
luncheon
are
exceptional
when
the
dinner
is
large
and
formal
or
even
when
it
numbers
only
eight
or
ten
it
is
wise
to
have
small
cards
with
the
names
of
the
guests
at
each
place
at
the
table
and
if
the
guests
are
strangers
to
each
other
to
have
a
tray
in
the
or
hall
where
they
remove
their
coats
and
hats
with
tiny
envelopes
addressed
to
each
containing
little
cards
on
which
is
written
the
name
of
the
dinner
partner
the
hostess
must
see
that
as
soon
as
two
dinner
partners
are
in
the
receiving
room
before
dinner
they
meet
each
other
and
have
a
chance
for
a
little
conversation
before
the
meal
is
announced
and
she
should
also
make
a
point
to
introduce
each
woman
before
dinner
to
the
man
who
is
to
sit
on
the
other
side
of
her
introductions
are
not
proper
at
the
table
and
at
a
large
dinner
it
is
awkward
to
introduce
all
guests
to
each
other
before
the
meal
at
a
small
dinner
of
course
it
is
not
necessary
to
observe
all
this
formality
and
the
hostess
may
introduce
her
guests
to
each
other
without
much
ceremony
when
the
company
numbers
only
four
or
six
but
with
more
each
woman
should
be
provided
with
a
partner
who
escorts
her
to
the
table
at
a
small
function
there
need
be
but
a
few
minutes
of
waiting
before
the
guests
are
all
seated
the
guest
of
honor
sits
at
the
right
of
the
host
as
to
the
manner
of
arranging
the
table
there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
however
generally
speaking
there
should
be
a
napkin
squarely
folded
in
front
of
each
guest
and
at
the
left
of
it
the
forks
a
fish
fork
and
a
large
and
a
small
ordinary
fork
at
the
right
of
the
napkin
should
be
the
knives
and
spoons
a
glass
plate
if
used
and
a
salt
cellar
and
in
the
center
of
the
table
on
an
embroidered
centerpiece
or
circular
mirror
the
floral
decorations
at
the

sweet
and
sour
olives
salted
almonds
etc
are
used
to
prepare
such
dishes
as
terrapin
oysters
or
whatever
may
be
cooked
absolutely
on
the
table
a
napkin
and
plate
or
tray
is
best
liked
for
removing

finger
bowls
should
always
follow
the
last

at
formal
and
informal
meals
alike
except
at
breakfast

course
the
is
put
on
the
table
when
the
covers
are
laid
ready
for
the
fruit
course

no
longer
used
but
if
one
should
be
fancied
it
would
be
better
to
put
the
bowl
of
the
spoon
in
the
holder
first
unless
one
serves
something
more
than
wafers
small
cakes
tea
and
chocolate
on
an
day
napkins
are
not
necessary
if
however
there
is
some
dish
that
will
soil
the
fingers
or
the
lips
then
there
should
be
a
pile
of
small
napkins
on
the
should
not
be
put
on
the
table
nor
should
they
be
used
outside

it
is
not

fold

eaten

one
is
staying

is
pouring

is
by
her
left
side
in
waiting
for
the
cups
after
that
she
should
be
on
the
alert
to
see
when
the
glasses
need
filling
or
when
there
is
bread
pickles
or
anything
to
be
passed
when
removing
the
plates
it
should
be
from
the
right
side
of
the
guest
but
everything
should
be
offered
at
the
left

the
right
hand
may
be
used
to
receive
it
when
a
dish
is
passed
and
there
is
no
maid
in
attendance
one
should
help
himself
and
pass
it
on
if
a
dish
is
standing
near
one
under
such
circumstances
he
may
quite
properly
ask
if
he
may
help
himself

do
so

a
plate
is
passed

a
helping

knife
and

are
laid
well
to
the
side
of

placed

will
not
fall
off
and
yet
not
be
in
the
way
of
the
server
all
the
appurtenances
of
each
course
should
be
removed
before
the
succeeding
one
is
served

plates
however
should
be
removed
before
the
salad
course
as
crackers
and
cheese
are
passed
with
this
the
salad
plate
being
used
to
hold
all
three
things
the
salted
almonds
should
be
started
about

table
by
the
hostess
soon
after
the
guests
are
seated
some
hostesses
possess
or
china
individual
dishes
on

are
placed

helps
himself

it
is
quite
usual
for

to
be

by
the
maid

coffee
is
served

it
is
not

a
man
so
much
as
his
manners
at

there
are
a
thousand
little
points
to
be
observed

although
not
absolutely
necessary
distinctly
stamp
the
refined
and
man
a
man
may
pass
muster
by
dressing
well
and
may
sustain
himself
tolerably
in
conversation

if
he
is
not
nearly
perfect
in
table
etiquette
dining
will
betray
him
any
unpleasant
peculiarity
abruptness
or
coarseness
of
manner
is
especially
offensive
at

are
more
easily
disgusted
at

than
at

care
however
is
usually
taken
to
leave
as
few
bones
as
possible
in
the
fish
since
the
general
use
of

it
also
remains
when
the
cup
is
empty
it
is
not
proper
to
eat
gravy

instead
it
should
be
regarded
as

simply
eaten

forms

is
decreed
by
custom
that
the
small
bones
of
any
bird
may
be
taken
in
the
fingers

the
meat
eaten
from

this

always
be
done
daintily

up

in
any

arrange
the
plates

for
the
benefit
of

work
which
is
to
take
away
the
plates
without
any
help
when
one
wishes
for
bread
or
anything
of
that
sort
he
should
simply
ask
for
it
either
addressing
his
request
to
the
servant
or
if
there
is
none

is
given

goes
into

may

its
proper
accompaniments
are

and
either

it
is
in
better
form
to
have
a
luncheon
served
at
a
large
table
especially
when
the
guests
do
not
number
more
than
twenty
than
to
have
small
tables
two
is
the
fashionable
hour
for
a
luncheon
after
it
is
over
the
guests
usually
disperse
a
host
in
entertaining
at
a
hotel
or
a
restaurant
even
if
he
entertains
only
one
woman
should
give
the
order
for
the
meal
himself
and
save
her
the
slight
embarrassment
it
may
be
for
her
to
make
her
own
selection
the
most
courteous
thing
is
for
him
to
order
the
meal
beforehand
but
if
the
occasion
is
very
informal
and
he
prefers
to
wait
until
they
are
at
the
table
he
should
after
he
and
his
guest
are
seated
hand
the
menu
to
her
and
ask
if
she
has
any
especial
preference
and
then
respecting
her
wishes
give
the
order
himself
to
the
waiter
if
however
friends
happen
in
and
are
asked
informally
to
stay
to
a
meal
at
a
hotel
they
may
order
themselves
what
they
want
from
the
menu
and
if
necessary
the
host
or
hostess
of
the
occasion
may
pay
the
bill
before
leaving
the
but
the
bill
should
not
be
paid

come
first
then

or
a

whatever
dessert
may
be
desired
and
coffee
very
often
a
woman
is
well
served
when
she
is
alone
by
allowing
the
waiter
to
arrange
a
dinner
for
her
if
the
only
guest
at
the
family
is
a
man
he
should
not
be
served
until
all
the
ladies
of
the
family
have
been
attended
to
if
the
hostess
is
the
only
woman
at
the
table
she
is
served
first
as
a
lady
is
of
most
importance
from
a
social
standpoint
and
it
is
always
proper
to
attend
to
her
wants
first
after
her
the
man
who
is
a
visitor
or
whose
age
gives
him
precedence
receives
attention
the
guest
of
honor
at
a
tea
arrives
a
little
earlier
than
the
other
guests
and
remains
somewhat
later
but
at
a
luncheon
or
dinner
she
should
appear
at
the
regulation
time
one
should
remove
gloves
at
a
luncheon
but
the
retaining
of
the
hat
is
entirely
a
matter
of
personal
taste
the
inconsiderate
guest
who
arrives
late
for
luncheon
or
dinner
is
shown
immediately
into
the
and
the
hostess
does
not
leave
her
guests
but
simply
rises
and
motions
him
to
a
seat
when
he
enters
the
room
ten
minutes
is
the
time
usually
allowed
for
each
course
where
more
than
a
dinner
is
served
the
correct
and
usual
way
of
seating
a
bridal
party
at
a
wedding
entertainment
is
for
the
groom
to
sit
at
one
end
of
the
table
and
the
bride
at
the
other
end
the
best
man
on
the
right
and
the
maid
of
honor
or
first
bridemaid
on
the
right
the
other
bridemaids
and
ushers
are
placed
wherever
seems
best
as
a
usual
thing
the
parents
of
the
bride
and
groom
do
not
sit
at
the
same
table
with
the
immediate
bridal
party
but
at
another
table
together
with
the
near
relatives
on
both
sides
and
perhaps
the
minister
who
officiated
at
the
wedding
and
his
wife
but
if
it
seems
desirable
to
have
the
parents
at
the
bridal
table
it
is
perfectly
proper
to
seat
them
there
there
are
certain
distinctive
features
of
a
bridal
table
which
must
be
in
evidence
one
is
the
wedding
or
cake
and
this
cake
should
be
the
central
ornament
and
should
be
surrounded
with
a
wreath
of
roses
the
should
have
the
initials
of
the
bride
and
groom
woven
together
for
decoration
and
the
souvenirs
may
be
small
satin
boxes
containing
wedding
cake
servants
and
serving
there
is
so
much
to
say
upon
the
subject
of
servants
notwithstanding
so
much
has
already
been
said
it
is
difficult
to
know
where
to
begin
but
in
the
first
place
every
woman
should
remember
that
servants
are
like
herself
human
and
that
in
our
free
america
they
are
becoming
very
independent
not
to
say
thus
a
house
mistress
has
no
small
matter
to
deal
with
when
she
demands
obedience
and
respectful
attention
from
girls
who
are
generally
ignorant
and
often
impudent
and
the
greatest
strength
of
the
mistress
lies
in
her
power
to
control
herself
and
while
she
must
demand
respectfulness
from
her
servants
she
can
often
avoid
a
clash
with
them
by
using
a
little
tact
if
they
are
treated
in
a
kind
though
dignified
manner
unless
very
degenerate
they
will
usually
respond
satisfactorily
one
can
speak
with
perfect
propriety
of
the
one
servant
employed
as
maid
but
not
as
servants
should
be
expected
to
dress
neatly
and
where
there
is
but
one
she
should
have
a
clean
white
apron
ready
to
put
on
when
answering
the
being
prepared
with
a
tray
to
receive
the
card
she
should
also
know
before
answering
the
bell
who
is
in
and
who
is
not
at
home
and
what
excuse
if
any
to
make
for
each
one
called
for
servants
should
never
be
allowed
to
call
any
member
of
the
family
from
a
distance
as
from
the
foot
of
the
stairs
but
should
go
to
the
one
to
whom
she
wishes
to
speak
and
deliver
her
message
it
is
hard
to
say
under
all
circumstances
what
to
expect
of
a
nursery
governess
and
what
should
be
her
privileges
to
treat
her
with
the
greatest
consideration
is
well
worth
while
for
one
is
compensated
in
being
able
to
get
an
intelligent
ladylike
woman
who
may
be
trusted
to
guide
her
charges
wisely
one
may
ask
a
governess
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
with
the
children
dress
and
undress
them
eat
with
them
and
teach
them
and
take
the
entire
charge
of
them
but
of
course
one
will
provide
some
attractive
place
for
her
to
sit
during
the
evening
while
the
children
are
asleep
in
her
room
it
is
also
necessary
to
see
that
her
meals
are
well
cooked
and
carefully
served
and
to
permit
her
to
be
free
one
afternoon
and
evening
every
week
she
should
be
addressed
as
smith
not
by
her
first
name
it
is
expedient
to
supervise
the
work
of
the
general
servant
as
much
as
possible
and
if
it
is
more
convenient
for
her
to
go
up
the
front
stairs
to
announce
callers
and
to
go
down
them
to
answer
the
front
door
certainly
allow
her
to
use
the
front
stairs
instead
of
the
back
ones
on
occasions
a
waitress
or
is
no
more
privileged
to
use
the
front
stairs
than
a
general
servant
a
nurse
may
be
with
propriety
wherever
her
charges
are
allowed
if
a
maid
is
expected
to
wear
a
cap
it
is
usually
furnished
by
the
lady
of
the
house
it
is
good
form
to
address
the
servants
one
knows
when
entering
a
house
and
to
thank
them
for
any
attention
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
english
system
of
feeing
has
come
into
vogue
here
but
it
is
quite
customary
now
for
a
guest
after
a
visit
even
a
short
one
to
bestow
upon
a
servant
a
small
fee

of
a
dollar

funerals
mourning
civility
implies
it
is
the
last
touch
the
crowning
perfection
of
a
noble
funerals
at
no
place
is
a
lack
of
system
and
an
observance
of
formality
more
noticeable
than
at
a
funeral
an
undertaker
generally
has
charge
of
the
details
and
where
he
is
well
informed
and
has
sufficient
assistance
he
can
manage
affairs
nicely
but
there
is
a
great
deal
of
unostentatious
service
that
may
be
done
by
friends
indeed
must
be
they
can
assist
the
servants
in
arranging
the

before
the
funeral

who
may

and
in
every
way
stand
between
the
afflicted
family
and
the
outside

of
course
none

intimate
friends
can
be
of
service
at
such
a
time
all
others
no

how
willing
can
but
call
at
the
door
with
offers
of
service

are

they
are

head
of
the
casket
if
in
so
doing
his

can
be

it
is
usually
done
by

by

number
of
persons
who
are
seated
at

head
of
the
stairs
out
of
sight
and
unaccompanied
by
any
musical
instrument
those
who
are
not
going
to
the
cemetery
quietly
disperse
at
the
close
of
the
service
carriages
are
in
waiting
for
the
family
and
the
cortege
moves
as
soon
after
the
close
of
the
service
as
possible
in
the
meantime
the
nurse
if
one
still
remains
at
the
house
or
some
friend
with
the
assistance
of
the
servants
makes
everything
look
as
natural
and
pleasant
as
possible
before
the
return
of
the
family
if
visitors
come
in
later
of
course
it
depends
upon
circumstances
whether
or
not
they
should
be
admitted
church
funerals
are
more
formal
the
congregation
assembles
and
when
the
carriages
containing
the
family
arrive
the
organ
plays
softly
and
the
procession
enters
the
relatives
walking
close
to
the
casket
and
sitting
as
near
it
as
possible
after
the
services
the
procession
moves
out
in
the

people
in

be
sent
to
the
bereaved
in
due
time
after
the
death
in
token
of
sympathy
mourning
the
putting
on
of
mourning
is
a
question
that
should
be
decided
entirely
by
those
most
deeply
concerned
many
families
never
follow
the
custom
and
even
wear
white
instead
of
black
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
while
others
seem
to
consider
the
wearing
of
crêpe
as
a
mark
of
respect
shown
to
the
dead
to
assume
the
expense
such
a
change
in
clothing
would
entail
may
sometimes
be
placing
a
burden
upon
the
living
for
the
sake
of
the
dead
which
certainly
neither
custom
nor
reason
should
demand
then
to
many
the
wearing
of
crêpe
is
so
depressing
that
it
is
a
sin
against
self
to
put
it
on
none
but
uncultivated
persons
would
ever
think
of
criticising
one
for
not
doing
so
of
course
one
would
naturally
feel
like
dressing
in
as
subdued
colors
as
possible
if
not
in
assuming
half
mourning
black
and
white
lavendar
drab
etc
if
not
deep
black
or
crêpe
when
mourning
is
worn
by
a
wife
for
a
husband
it
is
worn
from
one
to
two
years
at
least
the
question
of
wearing
mourning
for
betrothed
must
be
decided
by
self
for
it
is
purely
a
personal
question
that
the
laws
of
etiquette
do
not
govern
when
crêpe
is
laid
aside
paper
and
cards
are
no
longer
proper
while
wearing
all
black
on
the
street
after
crêpe
is
laid
aside
one
may
wear
with
propriety
all
white
in
the
house
while
in
deep
mourning
one
does
not
go
into
society
all
that
mourning
etiquette
demands
is
that
one
acknowledge
her
calls
with
her
visiting
cards
which
should
be
sent
in
return
for
a
call
within
two
weeks
after
it
is
made
and
should
go

viii
politeness
of
young
children
give
a
boy
address
and
accomplishments
and
you
give
him
the
mastery
of
palaces
and
fortunes
wherever
he
waldo
a
mother
once
asked
a
clergyman
when
she
should
begin
to
educate
her
child
then
three
years
old
was
his
reply
have
lost
three
years
as
soon
as
the
child
can
talk
its
lessons
in
politeness
should
begin
among
a
first
words
should
be
and
a
child
should
never
be
allowed
to
leave
the
table
after
it
is
old
enough
to
understand
and
to
say
it
without
asking
to
be
excused
a
child
should
be
taught
to
pass
behind
and
not
before
one
little
boys
should
never
be
allowed
to
keep
their
hats
on
in
the
house
children
when
very
young
should
be
taught
to
be
generous
and
polite
to
their
little
visitors
and
if
necessary
to
give
up
all
of
anything
where
half
will
not
do
children
should
be
taught
to
in
playing
games
and
that
no
one
should
monopolize
the
pleasantest
part
of
a
game
children
soon
feel
a
pride
in
being
little
ladies
and
gentlemen
rather
than
in
being
rude
and
impolite
if
mothers
would
impress
upon
their
minds
how
stupid
they
appear
when
they
stand
staring
at
one
without
answering
when
addressed
with
or
a
like
salutation
they
would
be
anxious
to
know
what
to
say
and
to
say
it
children
do
not
always
know
what
to
answer
when
addressed
they
ought
to
be
taught
so
that
they
may
feel
no
embarrassment
when
children
inconvenience
others
they
ought
to
be
taught
to
say
or
in
the
cars
or
in
any
public
place
a
boy
or
a
girl
should
always
rise
and
give
his
or
her
place
to
an
older
person
a
child
should
always
learn
that
it
is
both
naughty
and
rude
to
contradict
and
to
say
and
when
told
to
do
anything
a
mother
who
is
as
careful
of
her
moral
nature
and
manners
as
of
his
physical
nature
will
guard
him
from
naughty
and
rude
playmates
as
closely
as
she
would
from
measles
or
a
mother
should
never
allow
any
disrespect
in
her
manners
toward
herself
nor
toward
any
one
older
than
they
are
they
should
be
taught
especially
to
reverence
the
aged
habits
of
politeness
and
kindness
to
the
poor
are
of
great
worth
and
easily
formed
in
childhood
virtue
is
born
of
good
habits
and
the
formation
of
habits
may
be
said
to
constitute
almost
the
whole
work
of
education
habits
have
been
compared
to
handcuffs
easily
put
on
and
difficult
to
rid
self
of
those
parents
who
regulate
their
lives
in
accordance
with
the
commands
of
the
bible
find
many
verses
which
are
of
great
assistance
in
teaching
politeness
to
young
children
such
as
ye
courteous
one
to
another
respectful
to
your
elder
to
others
as
ye
would
that
they
should
do
to
you
etc
a
child
should
be
thoroughly
trained
with
regard
to
table
manners
the
child
will
not
chew
his
food
with
his
mouth
half
open
talk
with
it
in
his
mouth
nor
make
any
unnecessary
noises
in
eating
and
he
will
handle
his
knife
and
fork
properly
children
should
be
taught
that
it
is
very
rude
to
look
into
drawers
or
boxes
or
in
fact
to
meddle
with
or
handle
anything
away
from
home
that
is
not
intended
for
them
to
play
with
children
should
be
made
to
understand
that
they
must
not
ask
too
many
questions
promiscuously
such
as
are
you
going
have
you
there
etc
a
child
should
be
taught
never
to
tease
a
mother
or
to
have
its
own
mother
teased
by
a
playmate
teasing
should
not
be
allowed
children
should
never
be
allowed
to
say
and
will
even
to
each
other
children
should
never
be
allowed
to
speak
of
an
elder
person
by
the
last
name
without
the
proper
prefix
they
should
also
be
taught
in
addressing
boys
and
girls
say
sixteen
years
of
age
to
use
the
prefix
as
or
before
the
given
name
thus
or
in
fact
all
people
should
observe
this
rule
in
addressing
the
young
except
in
case
the
older
person
is
very
familiar
with
the
younger
or
in
case
the
latter
is
too
young
to
be
so
addressed
children
are
now
taught
to
say
mamma
mamma
you
mamma
allen
allen
in
preference
to
etc
children
should
be
taught
that
it
is
rude
to
yawn
without
trying
to
suppress
it
or
without
concealing
the
mouth
with
the
hand
to
whistle
or
hum
in
the
presence
of
older
persons
or
to
make
any
monotonous
noise
with
feet
or
hands
beating
time
etc
to
play
with
napkin
rings
or
any
article
at
table
during
meal
time
to
pick
the
teeth
with
the
fingers
to
trim
or
clean
nails
outside
room
to
lounge
anywhere
in
the
presence
of
company
to
place
the
elbows
on
the
table
or
to
lean
upon
it
while
eating
to
speak
of
absent
persons
by
their
first
names
when
they
would
not
so
address
them
if
they
were
present
to
acquire
the
habit
of
saying
know
he
she
to
use
slang
words
to
tattle
to
hide
the
mouth
with
the
hand
when
speaking
to
point
at
anyone
or
anything
with
the
finger
to
stare
at
persons
to
laugh
at
own
stories
or
remarks
to
toss
articles
instead
of
handing
them
to
leave
the
table
with
food
in
the
mouth
to
take
possession
of
a
seat
that
belongs
to
another
without
instantly
rising
upon
his
return
to
leave
anyone
without
saying
to
interrupt
any
one
in
conversation
to
push
to
ridicule
others
to
pass
without
speaking
any
one
whom
they
know
etc
some
young
people
are
not
as
particular
as
they
should
be
about
certain
articles
of
the
toilet
such
as
combs
brushes
etc
one
should
always
have
such
things
for
his
own
individual
use
it
is
exceedingly
impolite
to
use
any
toilet
article
belonging
to
another
it
is
to
ask
questions
about
affairs
that
do
not
concern
one
or
to
pry
into
the
private
affairs
of
friends
to
inquire
the
cost
of
articles
indiscriminately
is
impudent
if
parents
are
not
at
home
when
visitors
come
in
or
are
too
busy
to
see
them
at
once
a
child
in
the
absence
of
a
maid
should
politely
show
them
in
offer
them
a
comfortable
chair
show
them
anything
he
thinks
they
will
be
interested
in
and
make
every
effort
to
entertain
them
agreeably
until
such
time
as
his
parents
can
take
his
place
he
should
then
politely
withdraw
from
the
room
children
and
young
people
should
early
learn
not
to
monopolize
the
best
light
or
the
most
desirable
seat
in
the
room
but
to
look
about
when
anyone
enters
whether
a
guest
or
an
older
member
of
their
own
family
and
see
if
by
giving
up
their
own
place
the
may
be
made
more
comfortable
a
boy
ought
to
show
to
his
mother
and
sisters
every
attention
he
would
show
to
any
other
woman
should
they
chance
to
meet
on
the
street
he
should
politely
raise
his
hat
he
should
allow
them
to
pass
first
through
a
door
give
them
the
inside
of
the
walk
help
them
into
a
carriage
and
everywhere
and
under
all
circumstances
treat
them
with
politeness
and
deference
girls
should
of
course
treat
their
brothers
in
the
same
polite
manner
for
they
can
hardly
expect
to
receive
attentions
where
they
are
unwilling
to
bestow
them
children
especially
little
boys
should
be
taught
not
to
precede
their
mothers
or
any
woman
into
theaters
street
cars
churches
elevators
or
into
the
house
or
even
a
room
etiquette
manners
are
the
shadows
of
virtues
if
not
virtues
if
teachers
realized
the
inestimable
amount
of
good
they
might
accomplish
by
giving
a
little
time
and
thought
to
the
manners
of
their
pupils
surely
they
would
willingly
give
it
those
of
their
pupils
who
have
no
proper
training
at
home
would
thus
gain
a
knowledge
which
in
after
life
would
prove
a
blessing
and
such
a
course
acted
upon
by
the
teacher
would
be
of
great
assistance
to
the
parents
of
those
who
are
well
trained
at
home
for
a
large
portion
of
a
time
is
spent
in
school
and
under
conditions
that
require
such
training
teachers
must
treat
their
scholars
politely
if
they
expect
polite
treatment
from
them
every
teacher
should
see
that
no
pupil
is
allowed
to
treat
those
of
a
lower
station
in
life
with
disrespect
it
is
a
common
occurrence
for
a
teacher
to
speak
with
seeming
disrespect
of
a
parents
blaming
them
for
the
lack
of
interest
in
school
truancy
etc
such
a
course
is
highly
reprehensible
in
the
teacher
and
gains
the
it
is
better
to
assume
that
the
parents
would
be
displeased
with
anything
wrong
in
the
pupil
and
to
appeal
to
the
pupil
for
his
or
sake
a
teacher
should
never
allow
herself
or
himself
to
be
addressed
by
pupils
as
but
as
miss
or
smith
if
pupils
would
take
pains
to
bid
a
teacher
and
they
would
appear
well
in
so
doing

easily
give
pleasure

another

atmosphere

a
is
dependent
upon
trifles

a
teacher
by
her
own
actions
and
in
accordance
with
her
requirements
insures
kindness
and
politeness
from
all
to
all
she
may
feel
almost
sure
of
the
success
of
her
school
young
misses
ought
to
be
addressed
by
the
teacher
as
julia
young
boys
too
young
to
be
addressed
as
should
be
addressed
as
brown
jones
etc
teachers
should
use
great
discretion
in
reproving
any
unintentional
rudeness
especially
on
the
part
of
those
ignorant
from
lack
of
home
training
if
such
were
reproved
gently
and
privately
it
would
be
more
efficacious
and
just
no
one
should
be
allowed
to
appear
to
disadvantage
from
ignorance
selfishness
untruthfulness
slang
rowdyism
egotism
or
any
show
of
superiority
should
be
corrected
in
the
young
teachers

with
what

intrust

business
correspondence
closely

it

important
to
make

letters
of
application
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
write
a
letter
of
application
because
one
must
speak
of
himself
and
of
his
ability
to
fill
the
position
sought
and
to
do
so

seeming
egotistic

can
refer
you
for

as
to
my
ability
and
character
i
desire
to
go
to
the
country
and
should
be
glad
to
work
for

if
you
can

per

i
am
informed
that
your
shipping
clerk
is
soon
to
leave
and
that
the
position
now
held
by
him
will
be
vacant
i
desire
to
apply
for
the
same
but
i
am
sorry
to
state
that
i
have
not
had
any
experience
in
this
particular
line
of
work
however
i
have
been
a
general
clerk
in
a
village
store
and
am
familiar
with
simple
which
would
probably
enable
me
to
learn
the
work
of
a
shipping
clerk
in
a
reasonable
length
of
time
in
case
you
should
wish
to
engage
me
on
trial
i
would
gladly
assist
without
compensation
your
present
clerk
until
the
end
of
his
engagement
which
i
understand
is
about
three
weeks
from
date
my
present
employer
is
webster
of
this
place
and
he
will
doubtless
answer
any
inquiries
concerning
my
work
that
you
may
address

such
letters
should
always
contain
a
stamp
for
a
reply
the
stamp
is
attached
by
its
corner
or
by
a
pin
to
the
head
of
the
letter
great
precaution
should
always
be
taken
not
to
send
a
letter
with
insufficient
postage
on
it
for
the
additional
postage
is
collected
from
the
person
to
whom
the
letter
is
sent
and
many
business
men
look
upon
such
neglect
as
inexcusable
if
they
do
not
consider
it
dishonest
inasmuch
as
it
compels
others
to
pay
what
the
writer
should
have
known
it
was
his
duty
to
pay
an
application
for
a
position
as
teacher
in
a
public
school
is
often
very
difficult
to
write
because
it
is
necessary
to
say
much
and
to
say
it
in
some
cases
to
men
who
are
not
thoroughly
familiar
with
business
principles
before
giving
any
forms
some
suggestions
which
experience
has
taught
may
be
of
great
importance
the
handwriting
should
be
natural
if
one
has
a
degree
he
should
not
sign
his
name
with
it
but
state
in
his
letter
that
he
is
a
graduate
naming
the
institution
from
which
he
was
graduated
all
boasting
should
be
avoided
one
should
not
ask
a
reply
by
return
mail
but
he
might
enclose
a
postal
card
or
a
stamp
with
a
request
to
be
informed
when
the
board
meets
to
consider
applications
one
ought
not
to
name
as
references
persons
who
know
nothing
about
his
work
for
although
they
may
if
consulted
endeavor
to
praise
him
they
will
show
their
ignorance
of
what
he
has
done
and
the
board
will
naturally
assume
that
he
has
no
better
references
as
a
rule
it
is
not
advisable
to
give
testimonials
from
ministers
or
from
county
superintendents
unless
the
writers
can
say
that
they
are
familiar
with
the
work
and
have
visited
his
school
very
old
testimonials
should
not
be
placed
before
a
board
indeed
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
testimonial
unless
it
comes
from
a
competent
judge
is
of
value
if
boards
would
consult
references
or
seek
information
from
outside
sources
it
would
be
only
just
to
all
concerned
but
as
they
will
not
often
do
this
it
is
wise
to
send
copies
of
two
or
three
generally
not
more
good
testimonials
and
to
have
one
or
two
of
the
friends
write
the
board
in
his
behalf
a
letter
of
application
especially
if
for
the
position
of
superintendent
or
that
of
principal
should
be
full
and
explicit
specifying
the
opportunities
the
writer
has
had
to
prepare
himself
for
the
position
rather
than
stating
that
he
has
done
for
in
the
latter
case
it
might
seem
like
boasting
sometimes
a
short
letter
unless
circumstances
demand
a
long
one
will
be
most
favorably
received
by
a
board
the
writer
once
knew
a
very
important
position
to
be
obtained
by
a
correspondence
about
as
follows
names
of
places
dates
are
omitted
to
the
honorable
board
of

i
learn
through
a
friend
in
your
county
that
the
position
of
superintendent
of
your
school
is
vacant
if
the
position
has
not
been
filled
i
desire
to
make
application
for
the
same

am
a

of

have
taught
three
years
i
am
now

of

to

respectfully
a
stamp
was
enclosed
for
a
reply
the
secretary
of
the
board
at
once
wrote
asking
for
references
and
stating
the
salary
paid
the
applicant
replied
that
he
did
not
wish
the
position
at
the
salary
named
and
thanked
the
secretary
for
the
trouble
he
had
been
given
had
the
applicant
written
a
long
letter
setting
forth
the
value
of
his
services
and
urging
the
board
to
raise
the
salary
it
is
not
probable
that
a
reply
would
have
been
received
by
him
the
simple
statement
that
he
did
not
want
the
position
at
the
salary
named
was
evidence
to
the
board
that
he
considered
his
services
worth
more
and
moreover
that
he
had
confidence
that
he
would
command
more
the
secretary
replied
to
the
last
short
note
asking
for
references
and
at
what
salary
he
would
accept
the
position
the
information
was
given
and
in
a
few
days
the
applicant
was
requested
to
meet
the
board
with
the
assurance
that
the
position
would
be
given
him
if
the
interview
proved
satisfactory
which
it
did
afterwards
the
applicant
was
informed
by
the
president
of
the
board
that
his
short
letters
written
in
an
almost
illegible
but
natural
hand
obtained
for
him
the
place
over
nearly
one
hundred
applicants
many
of
whom
were
college
graduates
of
long
experience
in
teaching
and
who
had
basketfuls
of
testimonials
but
not
one
of
whom
had
written
even
a
fairly
good
letter
of
application
many
cities
and
towns
have
stated
public
examinations
which
applicants
must
attend
before
they
can
be
employed
the
impression
of
character
and
of
qualification
produced
by
a
personal
interview
is
deemed
so
important
that
even
minor
appointments
are
scarcely
given
to
any
one
not
personally
known
to
one
of
the
school
board
or
to
some
one
in
whose
professional
judgment
they
have
great
confidence
preliminary
inquiries
about
positions
are
most
profitably
made
through
acquaintances
who
can
advise
one
whether
to
take
any
further
steps
one
might
write
as
follows

he

this

it
is
his
tribute

to
indulge
in
ridicule
of

whether

is
to
descend
below
the
level
of
gentlemanly
propriety
a
reverence
for
religious
observances
and
religious
opinions
is
a
distinguishing
trait
of
a
refined
mind
religious
topics
should
be
avoided
in
conversation
except
where
all
are
prepared
to
concur
in
a
respectful
treatment
of
the
subject
in

the

frequent
consultation

impolite
either
when

if
at

it
appears
as
if
one
were
tired
of
the

and
wished
them
to
be
gone
if
abroad
as
if
the
hours
dragged
heavily
and
one
were
calculating
how
soon
he
would
be
released
it
is
very
unbecoming
to
exhibit
petulance
or
angry
feeling
though
it
is
indulged
in
largely
in
almost
every
circle
the
true
gentleman
does
not
suffer
his
countenance
to
be
easily
ruffled
the
right
of
privacy
is
sacred
and
should
always
be
respected
it
is
exceedingly
improper
to
enter
a
private
room
without
knocking
no

however
intimate
will
justify
an
abrupt
intrusion
upon

likewise
the

a
little
slight
whether
real
or
imaginary
in
small
communities
where
near
neighbors
for
sake
borrow
back

forth
great
care
should
be
taken
that
the
practice
does
not
become
a
nuisance
as
it
surely
does
when
it
is
indulged
in
too
frequently
and
when
borrowed
articles
are
not
speedily
returned
and
in
good
condition
there
should
be
no
stinted
measures
in
returning
ostentation
is
snobbish
as
is
all
too
great
profusion
to
affect
not
to
remember
a

is
despicable
and
reflects
only
on
the
pretender

being
rude
and
insulting
one
is
judged
to
a
great
extent
by
the
character

associates
one
should
be
very
careful
how
he
asks
for
the
loan
of
a
book
if
interest
is
shown
in
one
its
owner
will
offer
it
for
perusal
if
willing
to
lend
it
when
reading
a
borrowed
book
one
should
take
the
best
of
care
of
it
and
return
it
as
soon
as
possible
no
real
lady
or
gentlemen
will
leave
finger
prints
upon
its
pages
or
turn
down
its
leaves
in
place
of
a
or
scribble
in
it
with
a
pencil
or
loan
it
to
a
third
person
without
the
knowledge
and
consent
of
the
owner
a
lack
of
reverence
in
one
in

house
of

low
parentage
or
a
coarse
nature

is
not
subject
to
refinement
to
whisper
and
laugh
during
any
public
entertainment
proclaims
and
invades
the
rights
of
others
one
ought
never
to
leave
the
house
after
the
entertainment
without
bidding
the
hostess
and
acknowledging
the
pleasure
the
evening
has
afforded
him
the
business
man
has
no
that
pays
him
better
than
a
good
address
it
is
only
those
persons
and
families
whose
position
is
not
a
secure
one
that
are
afraid
to
be
seen
outside
their
own
social
circle
one
should
never
reprove
servants
or
children
before
strangers
a
true
lady
will
not
betray
her
astonishment
at
any
violation
of
conventional
rules
least
of
all
will
she
make
it
her
province
to
punish
those
who
may
make
any
such
violation
if
one
on
meeting
another
fails
to
recall
the
name
he
should
frankly
say
so
one
should
never
recall
himself
to
the
recollection
of
a
casual
acquaintance
without
at
the
same
time
mentioning
his
name
in
a
a
man
should
take
his
hat
and
coat
into
the
apartment
where
he
is
going
to
call
and
not
leave
them
in
the
hall
on
the
first
floor
it
is
very
bad
taste
even
in
quite
a
large
party
for
young
girls
to
visit
a
man
at
his
office
it
is
perfectly
good
form
for
a
mother
to
invite
to
a
little
party
children
whose
parents
she
does
not
know
or
who
have
not
yet
called
upon
her
the
invitations
go
out
in
the
name
and
to
the
friends
it
is
extremely
rude
and
when
at
a
or
hotel
table
to
criticise
the
food
that
is
served
the
fact
that
it
is
paid
for
makes
it
none
the
less
an
evidence
of
bad
manners
people
who
are
not
satisfied
where
they
are
boarding
should
always
leave
they
have
no
right
to
make
others
uncomfortable
by
their
lack
of
women
of
do
not
permit
themselves
to
those
to
whom
courtesies
are
due
a
man
should
learn
to
put
his
coat
on
in
a
public
place
of
entertainment
so
that
he
will
not
require
assistance
from
the
woman
who
is
with
him
the
young
woman
to
whom
a
seat
is
offered
should
take
it
unless
her
companion
is
an
older
woman
when
it
would
be
quite
proper
to
extend
the
courtesy
to
her
it
is
very
bad
taste
even
for
a
frolic
for
a
young
girl
to
assume
clothes
or
get
herself
up
in
any
way
that
will
tend
to
make
herself
look
masculine
there
is
no
impropriety
in
giving
to
those
men
friends
with
whom
one
is
well
acquainted
some
trifling
souvenir
at
christmas
or
easter
or
on
birthdays
it
is
customary
for
a
young
man
to
send
a
young
woman
only
such
gifts
as
flowers
candy
and
books
and
as
these
presents
are
sent
merely
as
a
slight
return
for
her
hospitality
and
invitations
to
her
house
it
is
not
necessary
for
her
to
send
him
any
gift
in
return
if
however
a
young
woman
and
man
are
on
intimate
enough
terms
to
exchange
presents
she
may
send
him
any
small
article
for
the
desk
or
toilet
such
as
a
whisk
broom
case
or
books
which
are
a
good
present
and
always
acceptable
to
any
one
nothing
looks
more
than
to
see
a
young
man
under
his
roof
devoting
himself
during
a
whole
evening
entirely
to
one
young
woman
to
the
ignoring
of
the
others
a
man
who
is
escorting
two
women
in
the
street
should
not
walk
between
them
but
on
the
outside
of
both
near
the
curb
at
the
theater
or
at
any
place
of
amusement
or
at
church
he
should
sit
nearest
to
the
aisle
at
the
side
of
one
of
them
unless
there
is
some
good
reason
why
she
needs
his
support
a
man
seldom
offers
his
arm
to
a
woman
he
escorts
even
in
the
evening
a
husband
may
offer
his
arm
to
his
wife
of
course
and
a
man
may
proffer
this
help
to
an
invalid
or
aged
person
a
little
delicate
perfume
may
be
used
with
propriety
but
a
heavy
perfume
and
one
that
scents
the
entire
room
in
which
the
person
who
uses
it
happens
to
be
is
in
very
bad
form
in
opening
a
door
from
the
hall
to
the
a
man
should
hold
it
while
a
woman
precedes
him
in
entering
when
pardon
is
asked
for
some
slight
inattention
an
inclination
of
the
head
and
a
smile
is
the
best
answer
the
words
and
have
been
so
vulgarized
that
most
women
now
say
or
friend
it
being
taken
for
granted
that
they
number
among
their
friends
only
ladies
and
gentlemen
custom
never
condones
liberties
no
matter
how
slight
between
young
men
and
women
when
a
woman
is
visiting
any
acquaintance
who
should
call
upon
her
should
also
ask
for
her
hostess
and
if
she
is
absent
leave
a
card
for
her
it
is
considered
very
bad
taste
for
a
young
girl
to
address
a
man
with
whom
her
acquaintance
is
but
slight
by
his
christian
name
no
young
man
has
any
right
to
spend
the
entire
afternoon
and
evening
every
sunday
at
one
particular
house
to
the
annoyance
of
an
entire
family
who
do
not
like
to
make
him
conscious
of
the
fact
that
they
consider
him
a
bore
when
a
young
man
is
paying
a
visit
and
the
older
members
of
the
family
are
in
the
room
he
should
in
leaving
bid
them
first
and
afterward
say
his
farewell
to
the
young
girl
on
whom
he
has
called
it
is
in
bad
taste
for
her
to
go
any
further
than
the
parlor
door
with
him
even
if
a
correspondence
is
of
a
friendly
character
it
should
not
exist
between
a
married
woman
and
a
young
man
or
between
a
married
man
and
a
young
woman
it
is
not
good
taste
to
ask
men
friends
to
buy
tickets
for
charity
affairs
they
do
not
like
to
refuse
and
very
often
though
the
sum
required
may
be
small
they
can
not
afford
it
there
is
very
great
harm
in
young
girls
meeting
young
men
in
secret
the
men
will
have
no
respect
for
the
girls
and
nothing
but
mortification
for
the
girls
will
be
the
result
it
is
quite
proper
to
thank
any
public
servant
such
as
a
railroad
conductor
for
any
information
he
may
give
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
effusive
about
it
it
is
not
in
good
taste
nor
even
proper
for
young
women
to
go
alone
to
a
hotel
to
dine
with
a
man
when
a
girl
is
young
and
pretty
a
platonic
friendship
is
very
difficult
to
keep
up
when
a
man
friend
has
driven
a
woman
in
town
to
go
to
church
he
should
take
her
direct
to
the
church
and
leave
her
there
while
he
drives
where
his
carriage
and
horses
are
to
wait
until
after
the
service
of
course
he
would
walk
to
church
and
join
her
there
it
is
not
in
good
taste
for
different
members
of
a
party
to
go
off
in
pairs
and
spend
the
evening
alone
on
the
seashore
it
is
not
wise
for
a
young
woman
and
young
man
living
in
the
same
city
to
correspond
if
meeting
each
other
often
they
ought
to
be
able
to
say
all
that
is
necessary
one
has
no
right
whatever
to
read
a
postal
card
addressed
to
another
without
permission
the
very
minute
the
married
man
begins
to
tell
of
his
faults
the
time
has
come
to
cut
his
acquaintance
it
is
more
than
wrong
for
a
young
girl
to
receive
visits
from
a
married
man
in
entering
any
public
place
a
woman
should
precede
a
man
but
going
down
the
aisle
the
usher
of
course
would
precede
her
a
hostess
stands
to
receive
her
visitors
but
she
does
not
advance
to
meet
them
unless
the
visitor
should
be
some
one
quite
old
or
of
such
importance
that
the
visit
is
of
great
honor
the
hostess
extends
her
hand
to
the
men
who
call
as
well
as
to
the
women
a
woman
is
not
supposed
to
recognize
a
man
who
is
one
of
a
group
standing
in
a
public
place
since
a
modest
girl
will
not
look
close
enough
at
a
group
of
men
to
recognize
an
acquaintance
no
matter
how
well
a
woman
may
know
a
man
it
would
be
in
very
bad
form
to
send
him
an
invitation
which
does
not
include
his
wife
unless
it
should
be
at
some
affair
at
which
only
men
are
to
be
present
a
man
should
show
as
much
courtesy
to
a
woman
in
his
employ
as
he
does
to
the
women
he
meets
in
social
life
it
is
not
in
good
taste
to
visit
at
the
home
of
betrothed
unless
a
personal
invitation
is
received
from
his
mother
two
women
may
attend
with
perfect
propriety
a
place
of
amusement
without
an
escort
they
should
be
however
under
such
circumstances
exceptionally
quiet
in
their
manners
and
their
dress
in
escorting
a
young
woman
home
a
man
should
go
up
the
steps
with
her
wait
until
the
door
is
opened
and
as
she
enters
the
house
raise
his
hat
and
say
if
a
young
girl
were
very
ill
there
would
be
no
impropriety
in
her
mother
bringing
her
betrothed
to
see
her
although
of
course
she
would
remain
in
the
room
during
his
visit
it
is
always
proper
and
courteous
for
a
person
in
church
to
share
either
or
hymnal
with
anyone
who
may
be
without
either
there
is
no
impropriety
in
a
permitting
a
man
friend
to
assist
her
in
putting
on
her
if
one
approves
of
the
acting
or
the
sentiment
of
the
play
there
is
no
impropriety
in
expressing
gentle
applause
but
a
loud
clapping
of
the
hands
is
decidedly
vulgar
one
should
never
prevent
people
from
leaving
his
house
when
they
desire
that
is
not
hospitality
it
is
tyranny
it
is
taking
a
mean
advantage
of
their
unwillingness
to
offend
if
a
women
lives
in
a
boarding
house
and
has
only
one
room
it
would
be
very
bad
taste
to
receive
any
man
visitor
there
even
if
it
is
not
quite
so
agreeable
they
should
be
received
in
the
public
parlor
when
a
man
and
woman
approach
a
hostess
together
the
hostess
should
shake
hands
with
the
woman
first
when
a
man
calls
on
a
woman
he
shakes
hands
with
her
on
his
arrival
but
unless
he
is
very
intimate
in
the
house
a
simple
bow
is
sufficient
when
he
leaves
an
unmarried
woman
writing
her
name
in
a
hotel
register
should
prefix
it
with
in
parentheses
when
a
man
friend
has
taken
a
lady
to
a
concert
she
should
thank
him
for
his
kindness
in
having
given
her
a
pleasant
evening
it
is
not
advisable
for
a
girl
to
deliberately
any
man
if
she
wishes
to
discontinue
her
acquaintance
with
a
man
whom
she
can
not
respect
it
may
be
done
gradually
at
first
by
the
coolest
of
greetings
then
by
a
look
in
the
other
direction
and
in
time
all
recognition
will
cease
if
a
stranger
takes
occasion
to
be
polite
to
one
during
a
accident
all
that
is
necessary
is
a
polite
when
a
man
who
is
to
escort
a
girl
to
an
entertainment
calls
for
her
at
her
own
home
it
is
proper
for
her
to
appear
with
her
wraps
on
and
be
ready
to
start
at
once
if
a
man
is
courteous
enough
to
open
the
door
of
a
store
or
any
public
building
for
a
woman
she
should
thank
him
if
a
girl
of
sixteen
goes
to
an
evening
affair
her
mother
should
arrange
to
have
either
a
servant
or
a
member
of
the
family
go
after
her
to
bring
her
home
if
the
hostess
opens
the
door
for
a
man
caller
she
should
precede
him
in
entering
the
parlor
after
having
taken
a
meal
or
having
received
any
other
kind
of
entertainment
at
a
private
house
before
leaving
a
guest
should
express
his
thanks
or
rather
his
enjoyment
of
the
same
to
the
hostess
this
courtesy
from
a
young
man
or
girl
is
very
acceptable
to
elderly
ladies
queen
victoria
has
forgiven
certain
breaches
of
etiquette
made
in
ignorance
and
left
her
guest
to
discover
the
mistake
at
another
time
it
is
a
reprehensible
host
indeed
who
does
otherwise
and
so
makes
a
guest
uncomfortable
etiquette
is
all
wrong
and
false
when
it
makes
one
forget
the
higher
laws
of
courtesy
or
hospitality
