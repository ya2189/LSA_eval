being
a
kind
who
fed

but
little
all
of
his
other
masters

slaves
but
was
kind
to
those
that
he
did
own
although
very
young
during
slavery
parson
remembers
many
plantation
activities
and
customs
among
which
are
the
following
that
the
master
children
and
those
of
the
slaves
on
the
plantation
played
together
the
farm
crops
consisted
of
corn
cotton
peas
wheat
and
oats
that
the
food
for
the
slaves
was
cooked
in
pots
which
were
hung
over
a
fire
that
the
iron
ovens
used
by
the
slaves
had
tops
for
baking
how
during
the
civil
war
wheat
corn
and
dried
potatoes
were
parched
and
used
as
substitutes
for
coffee
that
his
mother
was
given
a
peck
of
flour
every
two
weeks
that
a
mixture
of
salt
and
sand
was
dug
from
the
earthern
floor
of
the
smokehouse
and
water
poured
over
it
to
get
the
salt
drippings
for
seasoning
that
most
medicine
consisted
of
boiled
roots
when
thread
and
cloth
were
dyed
with
the
dye
obtained
from
maple
bark
when
shoes
were
made
on
a
wooden
last
and
soles
and
uppers
fastened
together
with
maple
pegs
when
the
white
preachers
preached
obey
your
masters
that
the
first
buggy
that
he
saw
was
owned
by
his
master
lane
it
had
a
seat
at
the
rear
with
rest
which
was
usually
occupied
by
a
man
who
was
called
the
waiter
there
was
no
top
to
the
seat
and
the
waiter
was
exposed
to
the
weather
he
recalls
when
wooden
slats
and
tightened
ropes
were
used
for
bed
springs
also
the
patience
of
aunt
letha
an
old
woman
slave
who
took
care
of
the
children
in
the
neighborhood
while
their
parents
worked
and
how
they
enjoyed
watching
uncle
umphrey
tan
cow
and
pig
hides
parson
describes
himself
as
being
very
frisky
as
a
boy
and
states
that
he
did
but
very
little
work
and
got
but
very
few
whippings
twice
he
ran
away
to
escape
being
whipped
and
hid
in
asparagus
beds
in
sparta
georgia
until
nightfall
when
he
returned
the
master
would
not
whip
him
because
he
was
apprehensive
that
he
might
run
away
again
and
be
stolen
by
poorer
whites
and
thus
cause
trouble
the
richer
whites
he
relates
were
afraid
of
the
poorer
whites
if
the
latter
were
made
angry
they
would
round
up
the
owners
sheep
and
turn
them
loose
into
their
cotton
fields
and
the
sheep
would
eat
the
cotton
row
by
row
he
compares
the
relationship
between
the
rich
and
poor
whites
during
slavery
with
that
of
the
white
and
negro
people
of
today
with
a
face
full
of
frowns
parson
tells
of
a
white
man
persuading
his
mother
to
let
him
tie
her
to
show
that
he
was
master
promising
not
to
whip
her
and
she
believed
him
when
he
had
placed
her
in
a
buck
hands
tied
on
a
stick
so
that
the
stick
would
turn
her
in
any
direction
he
whipped
her
until
the
blood
ran
down
her
back
with
changed
expression
he
told
of
an
incident
during
the
civil
war
slaves
he
explained
had
to
have
passes
to
go
from
one
plantation
to
another
and
if
one
were
found
without
a
pass
the
patrollers
would
pick
him
up
return
him
to
his
master
and
receive
pay
for
their
service
the
patrollers
were
guards
for
runaway
slaves
one
night
they
came
to
aunt
rhoda
house
where
a
crowd
of
slaves
had
gathered
and
were
going
to
return
them
to
their
masters
uncle
umphrey
the
tanner
quickly
spaded
up
some
hot
ashes
and
pitched
it
on
them
all
of
the
slaves
escaped
unharmed
while
all
of
the
patrollers
were
badly
injured
no
one
ever
told
on
uncle
umphrey
and
when
aunt
rhoda
was
questioned
by
her
master
she
stated
that
she
knew
nothing
about
it
but
told
them
that
the
patrollers
had
brought
another
nigger
with
them
her
master
took
it
for
granted
that
she
spoke
the
truth
since
none
of
the
other
negroes
were
hurt
he
remembers
seeing
this
but
does
not
remember
how
he
as
a
little
boy
was
prevented
from
telling
about
it
asked
about
his
remembrance
or
knowledge
of
the
slaves
belief
in
magic
and
spells
he
said
i
remember
this
and
can
just
see
the
dogs
running
around
now
my
mother
brother
uncle
dick
and
uncle
july
swore
they
would
not
work
longer
for
masters
so
they
ran
away
and
lived
in
the
woods
in
winter
they
would
put
cotton
seed
in
the
fields
to
rot
for
fertilizer
and
lay
in
it
for
warmth
they
would
kill
hogs
and
slip
the
meat
to
some
slave
to
cook
for
food
when
their
owners
looked
for
them
bob
amos
who
raised
nigger
hounds
hounds
raised
solely
to
track
negro
slaves
was
summoned
and
the
dogs
located
them
and
surrounded
them
in
their
one
went
one
way
and
one
the
other
and
escaped
in
the
swamps
they
would
run
until
they
came
to
a
fence
each
kept
some
graveyard
dust
and
a
few
lightwood
splinters
with
which
they
smoked
their
feet
and
jumped
the
fence
and
the
dogs
turned
back
and
could
track
no
further
thus
they
stayed
in
the
woods
until
freedom
when
they
came
out
and
worked
for
pay
now
you
know
uncle
dick
just
died
a
few
years
ago
in
sparta
georgia
when
the
civil
war
came
he
remembers
hearing
one
night
sherman
is
coming
it
was
said
that
wheeler
cavalry
of
the
confederates
was
always
running
and
fighting
lane
had
moved
the
family
to
macon
georgia
and
they
lived
on
a
place
called
dunlap
hill
that
night
four
preachers
were
preaching
fellow
soldiers
the
enemy
is
just
here
to
bolden
brook
sixteen
miles
away
and
you
may
be
carried
into
judgment
prepare
to
meet
your
god
while
they
were
preaching
bombs
began
to
fly
because
wheeler
cavalry
was
only
six
miles
away
instead
of
miles
women
screamed
and
children
ran
wheeler
kept
wagons
ahead
of
him
so
that
when
one
was
crippled
the
other
would
replace
it
he
says
he
imagines
he
hears
the
voice
of
sherman
now
saying
tell
wheeler
to
go
on
to
south
carolina
we
will
mow
it
down
with
grape
shot
and
plow
it
in
with
bombshell
emancipation
came
and
with
it
great
rejoicing
he
recalls
that
republicans
were
called
radicals
just
after
the
close
of
the
civil
war
lane
was
able
to
save
all
of
his
meat
silver
and
other
valuables
during
the
war
by
having
a
cave
dug
in
the
hog
pasture
the
hogs
trampled
over
it
daily
parson
states
that
among
the
papers
in
his
trunk
he
has
a
piece
of
money
called
shin
plasters
which
was
used
during
the
civil
war
the
slaves
were
not
allowed
to
attend
schools
of
any
kind
and
school
facilities
immediately
following
emancipation
were
very
poor
when
the
first
teacher
miss
smith
a
yankee
came
to
sparta
georgia
and
began
teaching
sunday
school
all
of
the
children
were
given
testaments
or
catechisms
which
their
parents
were
afraid
for
them
to
keep
lest
their
masters
whip
them
but
the
teacher
called
on
the
parents
and
explained
to
them
that
they
were
as
free
as
their
former
masters
parson
states
that
when
he
was
born
his
master
named
him
monk
his
grandfather
willis
andrews
who
was
a
free
man
of
pittsburg
pennsylvania
purchased
the
freedom
of
his
wife
lizzie
but
was
never
able
to
purchase
their
four
children
his
father
also
named
willis
died
a
slave
was
driven
in
an
to
a
hole
that
had
been
dug
put
in
it
and
covered
up
his
mother
nor
children
could
stop
work
to
attend
the
funeral
but
after
the
emancipation
he
and
a
brother
returned
found
uncle
bob
who
helped
bury
him
and
located
his
grave
soon
after
he
had
been
given
his
freedom
parson
walked
from
union
springs
alabama
where
his
last
master
had
taken
him
back
to
macon
georgia
and
rejoined
his
mother
rachel
his
brothers
samuel
augustus
san
francisco
simon
peter
lewis
carter
powell
wendell
and
sisters
lizzie
and
ann
they
all
dropped
the
name
of
their
master
lane
and
took
the
name
of
their
grandfather
andrews
parson
possesses
an
almost
uncanny
memory
and
attributes
it
to
his
inability
to
write
things
down
and
therefore
being
entirely
dependent
upon
his
memory
he
had
passed
years
of
age
and
had
two
children
who
could
read
and
write
before
he
could
his
connection
with
edward
waters
college
has
given
him
a
decided
advantage
for
education
and
there
are
few
things
that
he
can
not
discuss
intelligently
he
has
come
in
contact
with
thousands
of
students
and
all
of
the
ministers
connected
with
the
african
methodist
episcopal
church
in
the
state
of
florida
and
has
attended
all
of
the
state
and
general
conferences
of
this
church
for
the
past
half
century
he
has
lived
to
be
years
of
age
and
says
he
will
live
until
he
is
this
he
will
do
because
he
claims
your
life
is
in
your
hand
and
tells
these
narratives
as
proof
in
when
the
present
atlantic
coast
line
railroad
was
called
the
and
i
was
coming
from
savannah
to
florida
some
tramps
intent
upon
robbery
had
removed
spikes
from
the
bridge
and
just
as
the
alarm
was
given
and
the
train
about
to
be
thrown
from
the
track
i
raised
the
window
and
jumped
to
safety
i
then
walked
back
two
miles
to
report
it
more
than
were
killed
who
might
have
been
saved
had
they
jumped
as
i
did
as
a
result
the
and
gave
me
a
free
pass
for
life
with
which
i
rode
all
over
the
united
states
and
once
into
canada
he
proudly
displays
this
pass
and
states
that
he
would
like
to
travel
over
the
united
states
again
but
that
the
school
keeps
him
too
close
i
had
been
very
sick
but
took
no
medicine
my
wife
went
out
to
visit
sister
nancy
shortly
afterwards
i
heard
what
sounded
like
walking
and
in
my
imagination
saw
death
entering
push
the
door
open
and
draw
back
to
leap
on
me
i
jumped
through
the
window
my
shirt
hung
but
i
pulled
it
out
hodges
a
baptist
preacher

hoeing
in

at
me
and

a
stiff

and
setting
over
a
white
man
when
he
should
have
a
shovel

was
the
opinion
of
a
man
in
the
vicinity
but
another
white
friend
named
javis
warned
him
and
advised
him
not
to
leave

the

jack

at
times
his
master
would
let
him
do
small
jobs
of
repairing
of

him
hams

good
time
the
wuk
was
hard
then
cause
if
we
had
big
crops
he
would
borrow
some
from
the
other
white
folks
he
used
to
give
us
meat
every
day
and
plenty
of
other
things
one
time
he
bought
all
of
us
shoes
and
on
sunday
night
would
let
us
go
to
wherever
the
preacher
was
meeting
he
used
to
give
my
papa
money
sumptimes
too
but
they
used
to
whisper
that
he
would
gamble
a
lot
we
used
to
see
a
whole
lot
of
men
come
up
to
the
house
sumptimes
and
stay
up
most
of
the
night
sumptimes
they
would
stay
three
or
four
days
and
once
in
a
while
after
one
of
these
big
doings
mistuh
smith
would
look
worried
and
we
would
get
no
meat
and
vary
little
of
anything
else
for
a
long
time
he
would
be
crabby
and
beat
us
for
any
little
thing
he
used
to
tell
my
papa
that
he
would
have
a
d
cent
until
he
made
some
crops
a
few
years
before
he
left
to
enter
the
war
the
slave
owner
came
into
possession
of
a
store
near
his
plantation
this
store
was
in
greensboro
either
because
the
business
paid
or
because
of
another
of
his
economic
spells
ownership
of
his
plantation
passed
to
a
man
named
kimball
and
most
of
the
slaves
with
the
exception
of
bill
austin
and
one
or
two
women
either
transferred
with
the
plantation
or
sold
bill
was
kept
to
do
errands
and
general
work
around
the
store
bill
learned
much
about
the
operation
of
the
store
with
the
result
that
when
smith
left
with
the
southern
army
he
left
his
wife
and
bill
to
continue
its
operation
by
this
time
there
used
to
be
frequent
stories
whispered
among
the
slaves
in
the
neighborhood
and
who
came
with
their
masters
into
the
country
store
of
how
this
or
that
slave
ran
away
and
with
the
white
of
the
section
engaged
in
war
remained
at
large
for
long
periods
or
escaped
altogether
these
stories
always
interested
austin
with
the
result
that
one
morning
he
was
absent
when
smith
opened
the
store
he
remained
away
or
nine
days
i
guess
before
a
friend
of
the
smiths
found
him
near
macon
and
threatened
that
he
would
kill
him
if
he
did
return
immediately
either
the
threat
or
the
fact
that
in
macon
there
were
no
readily
available
foodstuffs
to
be
eaten
all
day
as
in
the
store
caused
austin
to
return
he
was
roundly
berated
by
his
mistress
but
finally
forgiven
by
the
worried
woman
who
needed
his
help
around
the
store
more
than
she
needed
the
contrite
promises
and
effusive
declarations
that
he
would
alright
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
he
did
behave
for
several
whole
months
but
by
this
tine
he
was
great
big
boy
and
he
had
caught
sight
of
a
young
woman
who
took
his
fancy
on
his
trip
to
macon
she
was
free
herself
her
father
had
bought
her
freedom
with
that
of
her
mother
a
few
years
before
and
did
odd
jobs
for
the
white
people
in
the
city
for
a
livelihood
bill
had
thoughts
of
going
back
to
macon
marrying
her
and
bringing
her
back
work
for
missus
with
me
he
asked
permission
to
go
and
was
refused
on
the
grounds
that
his
help
was
too
badly
needed
at
the
store
shortly
afterward
he
had
again
disappeared
however
knew
too
much
of
his
plans
by
this
time
and
it
was
no
difficult
task
to
have
him
apprehended
in
macon
bill
may
not
have
had
such
great
objections
to
the
apprehension
either
he
says
because
by
this
time
he
had
learned
that
the
young
woman
in
macon
had
no
slightest
intention
to
give
up
her
freedom
to
join
him
at
greensboro
a
relative
of
smith
gave
austin
a
sound
beating
on
his
return
for
a
time
it
had
the
desired
effect
and
he
stayed
at
the
store
and
gave
no
further
trouble
smith
however
thought
of
a
surer
plan
of
keeping
him
in
greensboro
she
called
him
and
told
him
he
might
have
his
freedom
bill
never
attempted
to
again
leave
the
place
although
he
did
not
receive
a
cent
for
his
work
until
his
master
had
died
the
store
passed
into
the
hands
of
one
of
smith
sons
and
the
emancipation
of
all
the
slaves
was
a
matter
of
eight
or
ten
years
history
when
he
finally
left
greene
and
hancock
counties
about
years
ago
austin
settled
in
jackson
county
he
married
and
began
the
raising
of
a
family
at
present
he
has
nineteen
living
children
more
grandchildren
than
he
can
accurately
tell
and
is
living
with
his
third
wife
a

united

marshal
registration
inspector
being
only
eight
years
of
age
when
the
emancipation
proclamation
was
issued
he
remembers
little
of
his
life
as
a
slave
the
master
was
kind
in
an
impersonal
way
but
made
no
provision
for
his
freedmen
as
did
many
other
southerners
usually
in
the
form
of
land
grants
although
he
gave
them
their
freedom
as
soon
as
the
proclamation
was
issued
berry
learned
from
his
elders
that
their
master
was
a
noted
duelist
and
owned
several
fine
pistols
some
of
which
have
very
bloody
histories
it
was
during
the
hectic
days
that
followed
the
civil
war
that
berry
served
in
the
offices
he
held
his
marshalship
under
a
judge
king
of
jacksonville
florida
as
state
and
federal
government
contractor
he
built
many
public
structures
a
few
of
which
are
still
in
use
among
them
the
jetties
at
mayport
florida
which
he
helped
to
build
and
a
jail
at
high
springs
florida
it
was
during
the
war
between
the
indians
and
settlers
that
grandmother
serving
as
a
nurse
at
tampa
bay
was
captured
by
the
indians
and
carried
away
to
become
the
squaw
of
their
chief
she
was
later
by
her
owners
this
was
a
common
procedure
according
to
berry
statements
indians
often
captured
slaves
particularly
the
women
or
aided
in
their
escape
and
almost
always
intermarried
with
them
the
red
men
were
credited
with
inciting
many
uprisings
and
wholesale
escapes
among
the
slaves
country
frolics
dances
were
quite
often
attended
by
indians
whose
main
reason
for
going
was
to
obtain
whiskey
for
which
they
had
a
very
strong
fondness
berry
describes
an
intoxicated
indian
as
a
tornado
mad
man
and
recalls
a
hair
raising
incident
that
ended
in
tragedy
for
the
offender
a
group
of
indians
were
attending
one
of
these
frolics
at
fort
myers
and
everything
went
well
until
one
of
the
number
became
intoxicated
terrorizing
the
negroes
with
bullying
and
fighting
anyone
with
whom
he
could
pick
a
quarrel
big
charlie
an
uncle
of
the
narrator
was
present
and
when
the
red
man
challenged
him
to
a
fight
made
a
quick
end
of
him
by
breaking
his
neck
at
one
blow
for
two
years
he
was
hounded
by
revengeful
indians
who
had
an
uncanny
way
of
ferreting
out
his
whereabouts
no
matter
where
he
went
often
he
sighted
them
while
working
in
the
fields
and
would
be
forced
to
flee
to
some
other
place
this
continued
with
many
hairbreadth
escapes
until
he
was
forced
to
move
several
states
away
berry
recalls
the
old
days
of
black
aristocracy
when
negroes
held
high
political
offices
in
the
state
of
florida
when
negro
tradesmen
and
professionals
competed
successfully
and
unmolested
with
the
whites
many
fortunes
were
made
by
men
who
are
now
little
more
than
beggars
to
this
group
belongs
the
man
who
in
spite
of
reduced
circumstances
manages
still
to
make
one
think
of
top
hats
and
state
affairs
although
small
of
stature
and
almost
disabled
by
rheumatism
he
has
the
fiery
dignity
and
straight
back
that
we
associate
with
men
who
have
ruled
others
at
the
same
time
he
might
also
be
characterized
as
a
sweet
old
person
with
all
the
tender
reminiscences
of
the
old
days
and
the
and
childish
prejudices
against
all
things
new
as
might
be
expected
he
lives
in
the
past
and
always
is
delighted
whenever
he
is
asked
to
tell
about
the
only
life
that
he
has
ever
really
lived
together
with
his
aged
wife
he
lives
with
his
children
and
is
known
to
local
relief
agencies
who
supplement
the
very
small

relates
vividly
some
of
her
experiences
her
master
lancaster
jamison
was
a
very
kind
man
and
never
mistreated
his
slaves
he
was
a
man
of
mediocre
means
and
instead
of
having
a
large
plantation
as
was
usual
in
those
days
he
ran
a
boarding
house
the
revenue
therefrom
furnishing
him
substance
for
a
livelihood
he
had
a
small
farm
from
which
fresh
produce
was
obtained
to
supply
the
needs
of
his
lodgers
mary

and
a

the
children
called
the

never
resented
this

and
took
it
in
good
humor
many

stopped
at
his

mary

did
the
cooking
her

tended
the

and
mary
her

was
a

built
in
the

in
which
the

lived
her

had
a
separate
garden
in

a

busy

his
farm
that
there
was
no
time
for
him
to
attend
to
a
little
farm
that
he
was
allowed
to
have
he
overcame
this
handicap
however
by
setting
up
huge
scaffolds
in
the
field
which
he
burned
and
from
the
flames
that
this
fire
emitted
he
could
see
well
enough
to
do
what
was
necessary
to
his
farm

was
very
active
with
the

could
handle
it
with
the
agility
of

this
prowess
gained
her
the
title
of

cooking
stoves
were
unknown
and
cooking
was
done
in
a
fireplace
that
was
built
of
clay
a
large
iron
rod
was
built
in
across
the
opening
of
the
fireplace
on
which
were
hung

had
special
handles

fitted
about

them
in

over
the
blazing
fire

cooking
was
done
in

was
placed
in

fireplace
over
hot
coals
or
corn
cobs
potatoes
were
roasted
in

oft
times
mary

would
sit
in

of
the
fireplace
until
a
late
hour
in
the
night
and
on
arising
in
the
morning
the
children
would
find
in
a
corner
a
number
of
roasted
potatoes
which
their

had
thoughtfully
roasted
and
which
the
children
readily
consumed
lighting
system
matches
were
unknown
a
flint
rock
and
a
file
provided
the
fire
this
occured
by
striking
a
file
against
a
flint
rock
which
threw
off
sparks
that
fell
into
a
wad
of
dry
cotton
used
for
the
purpose
this
cotton
as
a
rule
readily
caught
fire
this
was

and
all
the
fire
needed
to
start
any
blaze
weaving
the
white
folk
wove
the
cloth
on
regular
looms
which
were
made
into
dresses
for
the
slaves
for
various
colors
of
cloth
the
thread
was
dyed
the
dye
was
made
by
digging
up
red
shank
and
wild
indigo
roots
which
were
boiled
the
substance
obtained
being
some
of
the
best
dye
to

was
used
as
a

and
when
this
ran
out
as
times
happened
parched
peanuts
were
used
for
the
purpose
mary
and
family
arose
before
daybreak
and
prepared
breakfast
for
the
master
and
his
family
after
which
they
ate
in
the
same
dining
room
when
this
was
over

and
boiling
in
iron
pots
similar
to
those
of

was
made
from
fat
and
lye
amusements
the
only
amusement
to
be
had
was
a
big
candy
pulling
or
hog
killing
and
chicken
cooking
the
slaves
from
the
surrounding
plantations
were
allowed
to
come
together
on
these
occasions
a
big
time
was
had
church
the
slaves
went
to
the
white
folks
church
on
sundays
they
were
seated
in
the
rear
of
the
church
the
white
minister
would
arise
and
exhort
the
slaves
to
your
masters
you
owe
them
your
respect
an
old
christian
slave
who
perceived
things
differently
could
sometimes
be
heard
to
mumble
yeah
wese
jest
as
good
as
deys

only
deys

and
we
black
huh
she
dare
not
let
the

were
held
in
a
slave
cabin
where
some
inspired
slave
led
the
services
in
the
course
of
years
jamison
married
again
his
second
wife
was
a
veritable
terror
she
was
always
ready
and
anxious
to
whip
a
slave
for
the
least
misdemeanor
the
master
told
mary
and
her
mother
that
before
he
would
take
the
chance
of
them
running
away
on
account
of
her
meanness
he
would
leave
her
as
soon
as
he
would
leave
the
house
this
was
a
signal
for
his
wife
to
start
on
a
slave
one
day
with
a
kettle
of
hot
water
in
her
hand
she
chased
mary
who
ran
to
another
plantation
and
hid
there
until
the
good
master
returned
she
then
poured
out
her
troubles
to
him
he
was
very
indignant
and
remonstrated
with
his
wife
for
being
so
cruel
she
met
her
fate
in
later
years
her
becoming
angry
at
some
of
her
doings
in
regard
to
him
shot
her
which
resulted
in
her
death
instead
of
mourning
everybody
seemed
to
rejoice
for
the
menace
to
well
being

removed
twice
a

to
get

obtained
and
boiled

resulting
they
always
returned
with
about
three
barrels
of
salt
the
greatest
event
in
the
life
of
a
slave
was
about
to
occur
and
the
most
sorrowful
in
the
life
of
a
master
freedom
was
at
hand
a
negro
was
seen
coming
in
the
distance
mounted
upon
a
mule
approaching
jamison
who
stood
upon
the
porch
he
told
him
of
the
liberation
of
the
slaves
jamison
had
never
before
been
heard
to
curse
but
this
was
one
day
that
he
let
go
a
torrent
of
words
that
are
unworthy
to
appear
in
print
he
then
broke
down
and
cried
like
a
slave
who
was
being
lashed
by
his
cruel
master
he
called
mary
mother
and
father
phyliss
and
sandy
i
ai
got
no
more
to
do
with
you
you
are
free

me
you
may
and
i
give
you
of
what
you
raise
they
decided
to
stay
when
the
crop
was
harvested
the
master
did
not
do
as
he
had
promised
he
gave
them
nothing
mary
slipped
away
mounted
the
old
mule
mustang
and
galloped
away
at
a
mules
snail
speed
to
newnansville
where
she
related
what
had
happened
to
a
union
captain
he
gave
her
a
letter
to
give
to
jamison
in
it
he
reminded
him
that
if
he
did
give
mary
family
what
he
had
promised
he
would
be
put
in
jail
without
hesitation
the
old
master
complied
with
these
pungent
orders
after
this
incident
mary
and
her
family
left
the
good
old
boss
to
seek
a
new
abode
in
other
parts
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
master
had
in
any
way
displayed
any
kind
of
unfairness
toward
them
perhaps
it
was
the
reaction
to
having
to
liberate
them
marriage
there
was
no
marriage
during
slavery
according
to
civil
or
religious
custom
among
the
slaves
if
a
slave
saw
a
woman
whom
he
desired
he
told
his
master
if
the
woman
in
question
belonged
on
another
plantation
the
master
would
consult
her
master
one
of
my
boys
wants
to
marry
one
of
your
gals
he
would
say
as
a
rule
it
was
agreeable
that
they
should
live
together
as
man
and
wife
this
was
encouraged
for
it
increased
the
slave
population
by
new
borns
hence
being
an
asset
to
the
masters
the
two
slaves
thus
joined
were
allowed
to
see
one
another
at
intervals
upon
special
permission
from
the
master
he
must
have
a
pass
to
leave
the
plantation
any
slave
caught
without
one
while
off
the
plantation
was
subject
to
be
caught
by
the
paderollers
a
low
class
of
white
who
roved
the
country
to
molest
a
slave
at
the
least
opportunity
some
of
them
were
hired
by
the
masters
to
guard
against
slaves
running
away
or
to
apprehend
them
in
the
event
that
they
did
who
would
beat
them
unmercifully
and
send
them
back
to
the
plantation
from
whence
they
came
as
a
result
of
this
form
of
matrimony
at
emancipation
there
were
no
slaves
lawfully
married
orders
were
given
that
if
they
preferred
to
live
together
as
man
and
wife
they
must
marry
according
to
law
they
were
given
nine
months
to
decide
this
question
after
which
if
they
continued
to
live
together
they
were
arrested
for
adultery
a
fryer
justice
of
the
peace
at
gainesville
was
assigned
to
deal
with
the
situation
around
the
plantation
where
mary
and
her
family
lived
a
big
supper
was
given
it
was
early
about
slave
couples
attended
there
was
gaiety
and
laughter
a
barrel
of
lemonade
was
served
a
big
time
was
had
by
all
then
those
couples
who
desired
to
remain
together
were
joined
in
wedlock
according
to
civil
custom
the
party
broke
up
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
mary
biddie
cognizant
of
the
progress
that
science
and
invention
has
made
in
the
intervening
years
from
emancipation
and
the
present
time
could
not
help
but
remark
of
the
vast
improvement
of
the
lighting
system
of
today
and
that
of
slavery
there
were
no
lamps
or
kerosene
the
first
thread
that
shearer
spun
was
for
a
wick
to
be
used
in
a
candle
the
only
means
of
light
beef
tallow
was
used
to
make
the
candle
this
was
placed
in
a
candle
mould
while
hot
the
wick
was
then
placed
in
the
center
of
the
tallow
as
it
rest
in
the
mould
this
was
allowed
to
cool
when
this
chemical
process
occured
there
was
a
regular
sized
candle
to
be
used
for
lighting

a
governor
slaves
matilda
brooks
who
lives
in
monticello
was
once
a
slave
of
a
south
carolina
governor
brooks
was
born
in
or
in
edgefield
her
parents
were
hawkins
and
harriet
knox
and
at
the
time
of
the
birth
of
their
daughter
were
slaves
on
a
large
plantation
belonging
to
governor
frank
pickens
on
this
plantation
were
raised
cotton
corn
potatoes
tobacco
peas
wheat
and
truck
products
as
soon
as
matilda
was
large
enough
to
go
into
the
fields
she
helped
her
parents
with
the
farming
the
former
slave
describes
governor
pickens
as
being
good
to
his
slaves
he
supervised
them
personally
although
official
duties
often
made
this
difficult
he
saw
to
it
that
their
quarters
were
comfortable
and
that
they
always
had
sufficient
food
when
they
became
ill
he
would
himself
doctor
on
them
with
pills
castor
oil
turpentine
other
remedies
their
diet
consisted
largely
of
potatoes
corn
bread
syrup
greens
peas
and
occasionally
ham
fowl
and
other
meats
or
poultry
their
chief
beverage
was
coffee
made
from
parched
corn
since
there
were
no
stoves
during
slavery
they
cooked
their
foods
in
large
iron
pots
suspended
from
racks
built
into
the
fireplaces
fried
foods
were
prepared
in
iron
large
frying
pans
with
legs
these
pans
were
placed
over
hot
coals
and
the
seasoning
was
done
with
salt
which
they
secured
from
evaporated
after
the
food
was
fried
and
while
the
coals
were
still
glowing
the
fat
of
oxen
and
sheep
was
melted
to
make
candles
any
grease
left
over
was
put
into
a
large
box
to
be
used
later
for
lye
for
the
soap
was
obtained
by
putting
oak
ashes
in
a
barrel
and
pouring
water
over
them
after
standing
for
several
days
until
the
ashes
had
decayed
holes
were
drilled
into
the
bottom
of
the
barrell
and
the
liquid
drained
off
this
liquid
was
the
lye
and
it
was
then
trickled
into
the
pot
into
which
the
fat
had
been
placed
the
two
were
then
boiled
and
after
cooling
cut
into
squares
of
soap
water
for
cooking
and
other
purposes
was
obtained
from
a
well
which
also
served
as
a
refrigerator
at
times
matilda
does
not
recall
seeing
ice
until
many
years
later
in
the
evenings
matilda
mother
would
weave
cloth
on
her
and
an
improvised
loom
this
cloth
was
sometimes
dyed
in
various
colors
blue
from
the
indigo
plant
yellow
from
the
crocus
and
brown
from
the
bark
of
the
red
oak
other
colors
were
obtained
from
berries
and
other
plants
in
seasons
other
than
for
the
cotton
the
children
were
usually
allowed
to
play
in
the
evenings
when
cotton
crops
were
large
however
they
spent
their
evenings
picking
out
seeds
from
the
cotton
bolls
in
order
that
their
parents
might
work
uninterruptedly
in
the
fields
during
the
day
the
cotton
after
being
picked
and
separated
would
be
weighed
in
balances
and
packed
tightly
in
bags
chicken
and
goose
feathers
were
jealously
saved
during
these
days
they
were
used
for
the
mattresses
that
rested
on
the
beds
of
wooden
slats
that
were
built
in
corners
against
the
walls
hoop
skirts
were
worn
at
the
time
but
for
how
long
afterward
matilda
does
not
remember
she
only
recalls
that
they
were
disappearing
the
time
i
saw
a
windmill
for
the
first
time
the
coming
of
the
yankee
soldiers
created
much
excitement
among
the
slaves
on
the
pickens
plantation
the
slaves
were
in
ignorance
of
activities
going
on
and
of
their
approach
but
when
the
first
one
was
sighted
the
news
spread
like
dry
grass
burning
up
a
hill
despite
the
kindness
of
governor
pickens
the
slaves
were
happy
to
claim
their
freedom
some
of
them
even
ran
away
to
join
the
northern
armies
before
they
were
officially
freed
some
attempted
to
show
their
loyalty
to
their
old
owners
by
joining
the
southern
armies
but
in
this
section
they
were
not
permitted
to
do
so
after
she
was
released
from
slavery
matilda
came
with
her
parents
to
the
monticello
section
where
the
knoxes
became
paid
house
servants
the
parents
took
an
active
part
in
politics
in
the
section
and
matilda
was
sent
to
school
white
teachers
operated
the
schools
at
first
and
were
later
replaced
by
negro
teachers
churches
were
opened
with
negro
ministers
in
the
pulpits
and
other
necessities
of
community
life
eventually
came
to
the
vicinity
matilda
still
lives
in
one
of
the
earlier
homes
of
her
parents
in

now

his

he
was
given
to
flowden
wife
who
groomed
him
for
the
job
of
houseboy
although
he
never
received
any
education
bynes
was
quick
to
learn
he
could
tell
the
time
of
day
and
could
distinguish
one
newspaper
from
another
he
recalled
an
incident
which
happened
when
he
was
about
eight
years
of
age
which
led
him
to
conceal
his
precociousness
one
day
while
writing
on
the
ground
he
heard
his
mistress
little
daughter
tell
her
mother
that
he
was
writing
about
water
mistress
flowden
called
him
and
told
him
that
if
he
were
caught
writing
again
his
right
arm
would
be
cut
off
from
then
on
his
precociousness
vanished
in
regards
to
religion
bynes
can
recall
the
sunday
services
very
vividly
and
he
tells
how
the
negroes
who
were
seated
in
the
gallery
first
heard
a
sermon
by
the
white
minister
and
then
after
these
services
they
would
gather
on
the
main
floor
and
hear
a
sermon
by
a
negro
preacher
bynes
served
in
the
civil
war
with
his
boss
and
he
can
remember
the
regiment
camp
between
savannah
georgia
and
charleston
south
carolina
his
mistress
would
not
permit
bynes
to
accompany
his
master
to
virginia
to
join
the
hampton
legion
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
too
cold
for
him
and
thus
ended
his
war
days
when
he
was
years
of
age
his
father
turned
him
loose

acres
of

of

both
her

were
cotton
pickers
and
as
a
little
girl
della
often
went
with
her
parents
into
the
fields
one
day
she
stated
that
the
yankees
came
through
south
carolina
with
knapsacks
on
their
shoulders
it
was
until
later
that
she
learned
the
reason
when
asked
if
she
received
any
educational
training
aunt
bess
replied
in
the
negative
but
stated
that
the
slaves
on
the
hiwards
plantation
were
permitted
to
pick
up
what
education
they
could
without
fear
of
being
molested
no
one
bothered
however
to
teach
them
anything
in
regards
to
religion
aunt
bess
said
that
the
slaves
were
not
told
about
heaven
they
were
told
to
honor
their
masters
and
mistresses
and
of
the
damnation
which
awaited
them
for
disobedience
after
slavery
the
hart
family
moved
to
georgia
where

grew
into

at
an

was
born
in
shellman
georgia
years
ago
of
a
colored
mother
and
a
white
father
which
is
why
i
am
so
white
he
adds
he
has
never
been
known
to
have
passed
as
white
however
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
could
do
so
without
detection

two
of
these
children
were
sent

while
jacob
was
the

gilbert
a
good
sized
lad
when
slavery
was
at
its
height
recalls
vividly
the
cruel
lashings
and
other
punishments
meted
out
to
those
who
disobeyed
their
master
or
attempted
to
run
away
it
was
the
custom
of
slaves
who
wished
to
go
from
one
plantation
to
another
to
carry
passes
in
case
they
were
stopped
as
suspected
runaways
frequently
slaves
would
visit
without
benefit
of
passes
and
as
result
they
suffered
severe
torturing
often
the
sons
of
the
slaves
owners
would
go
nigger
hunting
and
nothing
not
even
murder
was
too
horrible
for
them
to
do
to
slaves
caught
without
passes
they
justified
their
fiendish
acts
by
saying
the
nigger
tried
to
run
away
when
told
to
stop
gilbert
can
not
remember
when
he
came
to
florida
but
he
claims
that
it
was
many
years
ago
like
the
majority
of
negroes
after
slavery
he
became
a
farmer
which
occupation
he
still
pursues
he
married
once

my

the

interesting
in
that
it
illustrates
the
miscegenation
prevalent
during
the
days

interesting
also
is
the
fact
that
florida
was
not
a

though
she
was
a

of
those
turbulent

a

wagon
it

father
charles
coates
father
charles
coates
as
he
is
called
by
all
who
know
him
was
born
a
slave
years
ago
at
richmond
virginia
on
the
plantation
of
a
man
named
his
early
boyhood
days
was
spent
on
the
place
filled
with
duties
such
as
minding
hogs
cows
bringing
in
wood
and
such
light
work
his
wearing
apparel
consisted
of
one
garment
a
shirt
made
to
reach
below
the
knees
and
with
sleeves
he
wore
no
shoes
until
he
was
a
man
past
years
of
age
the
single
garment
was
worn
summer
and
winter
alike
and
the
change
in
the
weather
did
not
cause
an
extra
amount
of
clothes
to
be
furnished
for
the
slaves
they
were
required
to
move
about
so
fast
at
work
that
the
heat
from
the
body
was
sufficient
to
keep
them
warm
when
charles
was
still
a
young
man
sold
him
on
time
payment
to
hall
who
several
years
before
the
civil
war
moved
from
richmond
to
washington
county
georgia
carrying
grown
slaves
and
many
children
hall
made
charles
his
carriage
driver
which
kept
him
from
hard
labor
other
slaves
on
the
plantation
performed
such
duties
as
rail
splitting
digging
up
trees
by
the
roots
and
other
hard
work
charles
coates
remembers
vividly
the
cruelties
practiced
on
the
hall
plantation
his
duty
was
to
see
that
all
the
slaves
reported
to
work
on
time
the
bell
was
rung
at
by
one
of
the
slaves
charles
had
the
ringing
of
the
bell
for
three
years
this
was
in
addition
to
the
carriage
driving
he
tells
with
laughter
how
the
slaves
would
grab
a
piece
of
meat
and
bread
and
run
to
the
field
as
no
time
was
allowed
to
sit
and
eat
breakfast
this
was
a
very
different
way
from
that
of
the
master
he
had
before
as
was
much
better
to
his
slaves
hall
was
different
in
many
ways
from
he
was
always
pretending
says
charles
that
he
did
not
want
his
slaves
beaten
unmercifully
charles
being
close
to
hall
during
work
hours
had
opportunity
to
see
and
hear
much
about
what
was
going
on
at
the
plantation
and
he
believes
that
hall
knew
just
how
the
overseer
dealt
with
the
slaves
on
the
hall
plantation
there
was
a
contraption
similar
to
a
gallows
where
the
slaves
were
suspended
and
whipped
at
the
top
of
this
device
were
blocks
of
wood
with
chains
run
through
holes
and
high
enough
that
a
slave
when
tied
to
the
chains
by
his
fingers
would
barely
touch
the
ground
with
his
toes
this
was
done
so
that
the
slave
could
not
shout
or
twist
his
body
while
being
whipped
the
whipping
was
prolonged
until
the
body
of
the
slave
covered
with
welts
and
blood
trickled
down
his
naked
body
women
were
treated
in
the
same
manner
and
a
pregnant
woman
received
no
more
leniency
than
did
a
man
very
often
after
a
severe
flogging
a
slave
body
was
treated
to
a
bath
of
water
containing
salt
and
pepper
so
that
the
pain
would
be
more
lasting
and
aggravated
the
whipping
was
done
with
sticks
and
a
whip
called
the
cat
o
nine
tails
meaning
every
lick
meant
nine
the
cat
o
nine
tails
was
a
whip
of
nine
straps
attached
to
a
stick
the
straps
were
perforated
so
that
everywhere
the
hole
in
the
strap
fell
on
the
flesh
a
blister
was
left
the
treatment
given
by
the
overseer
was
very
terrifying
he
relates
how
a
slave
was
put
in
a
room
and
locked
up
for
two
and
three
days
at
a
time
without
water
or
food
because
the
overseer
thought
he
had
done
enough
work
in
a
given
time
another
offense
which
brought
forth
severe
punishment
was
that
of
crossing
the
road
to
another
plantation
a
whipping
was
given
and
very
often
a
slave
was
put
on
starvation
for
a
few
days
one
privilege
given
slaves
on
the
plantation
was
appreciated
by
all
and
that
was
the
opportunity
to
hear
the
word
of
god
the
white
people
gathered
in
log
and
sometimes
frame
churches
and
the
slaves
were
permitted
to
sit
about
the
church
yard
on
wagons
and
on
the
ground
and
listen
to
the
preaching
when
the
slaves
wanted
to
hold
church
they
had
to
get
special
permission
from
the
master
and
at
that
time
a
slave
hut
was
used
a
white
preacher
was
called
in
and
he
would
preach
to
them
not
to
steal
lie
or
run
away
and
be
sure
and
git
all
dem
weeds
outen
dat
corn
in
de
field
and
your
master
will
think
a
heap
of
you
charles
does
not
remember
anything
else
the
preacher
told
them
about
god
they
learned
more
about
god
when
they
sat
outside
the
church
waiting
to
drive
their
masters
and
family
back
home
charles
relates
an
incident
of
a
slave
named
sambo
who
thought
himself
very
smart
and
who
courted
the
favor
of
the
master
the
neighboring
slaves
screamed
so
loudly
while
being
whipped
that
sambo
told
his
master
that
he
knew
how
to
make
a
contraption
which
if
a
slave
was
put
into
while
being
whipped
would
prevent
him
from
making
a
noise
the
device
was
made
of
two
blocks
of
wood
cut
to
fit
the
head
and
could
be
fastened
around
the
neck
tightly
when
the
head
was
put
in
the
upper
and
lower
parts
were
clamped
together
around
the
neck
so
that
the
slave
could
not
scream
the
same
effect
as
choking
the
stomach
of
the
victim
was
placed
over
a
barrel
which
allowed
freedom
of
movement
when
the
lash
was
administered
and
the
slave
wiggled
the
barrel
moved
now
it
so
happened
that
sambo
was
the
first
to
be
put
into
his
own
invention
for
a
whipping
the
overseer
applied
the
lash
rather
heavily
and
sambo
was
compelled
to
wiggle
his
body
to
relieve
his
feelings
in
wiggling
the
barrel
under
his
stomach
rolled
a
bit
straining
neck
and
breaking
it
after
sambo
died
from
his
neck
being
broken
the
master
discontinued
the
use
of
the
device
as
he
saw
the
loss
of
property
in
the
death
of
slaves
charles
was
still
a
carriage
driver
when
freedom
came
he
had
opportunity
to
see
and
hear
many
things
about
the
master
private
life
when
the
news
of
the
advance
of
the
union
army
came
hall
carried
his
money
to
a
secluded
spot
and
buried
it
in
an
iron
pot
so
that
the
soldiers
who
were
confiscating
all
the
property
and
money
they
could
would
not
get
his
money
the
slave
owners
were
required
to
notify
the
slaves
that
they
were
free
so
hall
sent
his
son
sherard
to
the
cabins
to
notify
all
the
slaves
to
come
into
his
presence
and
there
he
had
his
son
to
tell
them
that
they
were
free
the
union
soldiers
took
much
of
the
slave
owners
property
and
gave
to
the
slaves
telling
them
that
if
the
owners
took
the
property
back
to
write
and
tell
them
about
it
the
owners
only
laughed
because
they
knew
the
slaves
could
not
read
nor
write
after
the
soldiers
had
gone
the
timid
and
scared
slaves
gave
up
most
of
the
land
some
few
however
fenced
in
a
bit
of
land
while
the
soldiers
remained
in
the
vicinity
and
they
managed
to
keep
a
little
of
the
land
many
of
the
slaves
remained
with
the
owners
there
they
worked
for
small
monthly
wages
and
took
whatever
was
left
of
cast
off
clothing
and
food
and
whatever
the
old
missus
gave
them
a
pair
of
old
pants
of
the
master
was
highly
prized
by
them
charles
coates
was
glad
to
be
free
he
had
been
well
taken
care
of
and
looked
younger
than
years
of
age
at
the
close
of
slavery
he
had
not
been
married
had
been
put
upon
the
block
twice
to
be
sold
after
belonging
to
hall
each
time
he
was
offered
for
sale
his
master
wanted
so
much
for
him
and
refusing
to
sell
him
on
time
payments
he
was
always
left
on
his
master
hands
his
master
said
being
tall
healthy
and
robust
he
was
well
worth
much
money
after
slavery
charles
was
rated
as
a
good
worker
he
at
once
began
working
and
saving
his
money
and
in
a
short
time
he
had
accumulated
around
the
first
sight
of
a
certain
young
woman
caused
him
to
fall
in
love
he
says
the
love
was
mutual
and
after
a
courtship
of
three
weeks
they
were
married
the
girl
mother
told
charles
that
she
had
always
been
very
frail
but
he
did
not
know
that
she
had
consumption
within
three
days
after
they
were
married
she
died
and
her
death
caused
much
grief
for
charles
he
was
reluctant
to
bury
her
and
wanted
to
continue
to
stand
and
look
at
her
face
a
white
doctor
and
a
school
teacher
whose
names
he
does
not
remember
told
him
to
put
his
wife
body
in
alcohol
to
preserve
it
and
he
could
look
at
it
all
the
time
at
that
time
white
people
who
had
plenty
of
money
and
wanted
to
see
the
faces
of
their
deceased
used
this
method
a
glass
casket
was
used
and
the
dressed
body
of
the
deceased
was
placed
in
alcohol
inside
the
casket
another
casket
made
of
wood
held
the
glass
casket
and
the
whole
was
placed
in
a
vault
made
of
stone
or
brick
the
walls
of
the
vault
were
left
about
four
feet
above
the
ground
and
a
window
and
ledge
were
placed
in
front
so
when
the
casket
was
placed
inside
of
the
vault
the
bereaved
could
lean
upon
the
ledge
and
look
in
at
the
face
of
the
deceased
the
wooden
casket
was
provided
with
a
glass
top
part
of
the
way
so
that
the
face
could
easily
be
seen
although
the
process
of
preserving
the
body
in
alcohol
cost
charles
did
not
regret
the
expense
saying
i
had
plenty
of
money
at
that
time
after
the
death
of
his
wife
charles
left
with
his
mother
and
father
henrietta
and
spencer
coates
and
went
to
savannah
georgia
he
said
they
were
so
glad
to
go
that
they
walked
to
within
miles
of
savannah
when
they
saw
a
man
driving
a
horse
and
wagon
who
picked
them
up
and
carried
them
into
savannah
it
was
in
that
city

the
occasion

said
that
the
cause

long
life
was
due
to

close
to

early

to

early
and
not
dissipating
in
any

immediately
after
slavery
in
the
united
states
the
southern
white
people
found
themselves
without
servants
women
who
were
accustomed
to
having
a
nurse
maid
cook
and
laundress
found
themselves
without
sufficient
money
to
pay
wages
to
all
these
there
was
a
great
amount
of
work
to
be
done
and
the
great
problem
confronting
married
women
who
had
not
been
taught
to
work
and
who
thought
it
beneath
their
standing
to
soil
their
hands
found
it
very
difficult
there
were
on
the
other
hand
many
negro
women
who
needed
work
and
young
girls
who
needed
guidance
and
training
the
home
and
guidance
of
the
aristocratic
white
people
offered
the
best
opportunity
for
the
dependent
freed
women
and
it
was
in
this
kind
of
home
that
the
child
of
this
story
was
reared
irene
coates
of
windle
street
jacksonville
florida
was
born
in
georgia
about
she
was
close
to
six
years
of
age
when
freedom
was
declared
she
was
one
among
the
many
negro
children
who
had
the
advantage
of
living
under
the
direct
supervision
of
kind
whites
and
receiving
the
care
which
could
only
be
excelled
by
an
educated
mother
jimmie
and
lou
bedell
were
the
names
of
the
man
and
wife
who
saw
the
need
of
having
a
negro
girl
come
into
their
home
as
one
in
the
family
and
at
the
same
time
be
assured
of
a
good
and
efficient
servant
in
years
to
come
when
irene
was
old
enough
she
became
the
nurse
of
the
bedell
baby
and
when
the
family
left
savannah
georgia
to
come
to
jacksonville
they
brought
irene
with
them
although
irene
was
just
about
six
years
old
when
the
civil
war
ended
she
has
vivid
recollection
of
happenings
during
slavery
some
of
the
incidents
which
happened
were
told
her
by
her
slave
associates
after
slavery
ended
and
some
of
them
she
remembers
herself
two
incidents
which
she
considers
caused
respect
for
slaves
by
their
masters
and
finally
the
emancipation
by
abraham
lincoln
she
tells
in
this
order
the
first
event
tells
of
a
young
strong
healthy
negro
woman
who
knew
her
work
and
did
it
well
she
would
grab
up
two
bags
of
guana
fertilizer
and
tote
at
one
time
said
irene
and
was
never
found
shirking
her
work
the
overseer
on
the
plantation
was
very
hard
on
the
slaves
and
practiced
striking
them
across
the
back
with
a
whip
when
he
wanted
to
spur
them
on
to
do
more
work
irene
says
one
day
a
crowd
of
women
were
hoeing
in
the
field
and
the
overseer
rode
along
and
struck
one
of
the
women
across
the
back
with
the
whip
and
the
one
nearest
her
spoke
and
said
that
if
he
ever
struck
her
like
that
it
would
be
the
day
he
or
she
would
die
the
overseer
heard
the
remark
and
the
first
opportunity
he
got
he
rode
by
the
woman
and
struck
her
with
the
whip
and
started
to
ride
on
the
woman
was
hoeing
at
the
time
she
whirled
around
struck
the
overseer
on
his
head
with
the
hoe
knocking
him
from
his
horse
she
then
pounced
upon
him
and
chopped
his
head
off
she
went
mad
for
a
few
seconds
and
proceeded
to
chop
and
mutilate
his
body
that
done
to
her
satisfaction
she
then
killed
his
horse
she
then
calmly
went
to
tell
the
master
of
the
murder
saying
i
done
killed
de
overseer
the
master
replied
do
you
mean
to
say
you
killed
the
overseer
she
answered
yes
and
that
she
had
killed
the
horse
also
without
hesitating
the
master
pointing
to
one
of
his
small
cabins
on
the
plantation
said
you
see
that
house
over
there
she
answered
yes
at
the
same
time
looking
well
said
he
take
all
your
belongings
and
move
into
that
house
and
you
are
free
from
this
day
and
if
the
mistress
wants
you
to
do
anything
for
her
do
it
if
you
want
to
irene
related
with
much
warmth
the
effect
that
incident
had
upon
the
future
treatment
of
the
slaves
the
other
incident
occured
in
virginia
it
was
upon
an
occasion
when
abraham
lincoln
was
visiting
in
richmond
a
woman
slaveowner
had
one
of
her
slaves
whipped
in
the
presence
of
lincoln
it
was
easily
noticed
that
the
woman
was
an
expectant
mother
lincoln
was
horrified
at
the
situation
and
expressed
herself
as
being
so
saying
that
she
was
going
to
tell
the
president
as
soon
as
she
returned
to
the
white
house
whether
this
incident
had
any
bearing
upon
actions
or
not
those
slaves
who
were
present
and
irene
says
that
they
all
believed
it
to
be
the
beginning
of
the
president
activities
to
end
slavery
besides
these
incidents
irene
remembers
that
women
who
were
not
strong
and
robust
were
given
such
work
as
sewing
weaving
and
minding
babies
the
cloth
from
which
the
sunday
clothes
of
the
slaves
was
made
was
called
and
the
slave
women
were
very
proud
of
this
the
older
women
were
required
to
do
most
of
the
weaving
of
cloth
and
making
shirts
for
the
male
slaves
when
an
old
woman
who
had
been
sick
regained
her
strength
she
was
sent
to
the
fields
the
same
as
the
younger
ones
the
ones
who
could
cook
and
tickle
the
palates
of
her
mistress
and
master
were
highly
prized
and
were
seldon
if
ever
offered
for
sale
at
the
auction
block
the
slaves
were
given
fat
meat
and
bread
made
of
husk
of
corn
and
wheat
this
caused
them
to
steal
food
and
when
caught
they
were
severely
whipped
irene
recalls
the
practice
of
blowing
a
horn
whenever
a
sudden
rain
came
the
overseer
had
a
certain
negro
to
blow
three
times
and
if
shelter
could
be
found
the
slaves
were
expected
to
seek
it
until
the
rain
ceased
the
master
had
sheds
built
at
intervals
on
the
plantation
these
accomodated
a
goodly
number
if
no
shed
was
available
the
slaves
stood
under
trees
if
neither
was
handy
and
the
slaves
got
wet
they
could
not
go
to
the
cabins
to
change
clothes
for
fear
of
losing
time
from
work
this
was
often
the
case
she
says
that
slaves
were
more
neglected
than
the
cattle
another
custom
which
impressed
the
of
irene
was
the
tieing
of
slaves
by
their
thumbs
to
a
tree
limb
and
whipping
them
women
and
young
girls
were
treated
the
same
as
were
men
after
the
bedells
took
irene
to
live
in
their
home
they
traveled
a
deal
after
bringing
her
to
jacksonville
when
jacksonville
was
only
a
small
port
they
then
went
to
camden
county
georgia
irene
married
while
in
georgia
and
came
back
to
jacksonville
with
her
husband
charles

year
of
the
earthquake
at
charleston
south
carolina
about
irene
and
charles
coates
have
lived
in
jacksonville
since
that
time
she
relates
many
tales
of
happenings
during
the
time
that
this
city
grew
from
a
town
of
about
four
acres
to
its

irene
is
the
mother
of
five
children
she
has
nine
grandchildren
and
eight
her
health
is
fair
but
her

is

interesting
tales
of
the
changes
that
came
to
the
section
of
florida
that
is
situated
along
the
county
lines
are
told
by
neil
coker
old
former
slave
who
lives
two
miles
south
of
mcrae
on
the
road
grandin
coker
is
the
son
of
a
slave
mother
and
a
his
father
he
states
was
senator
john
wall
who
held
a
seat
in
the
senate
for
sixteen
years
he
was
born
in
virginia
and
received
his
family
name
from
an
old
family
bearing
the
same
in
that
state
he
was
born
as
nearly
as
he
can
remember
about
one
of
coker
first
reminiscences
is
of
the
road
on
which
he
still
lives
during
his
childhood
it
was
known
as
the
road
so
called
because
it
was
built
some
years
ago
by
a
man
of
that
name
who
hailed
from
west
florida
the
road
was
at
one
time
the
main
route
of
traffic
between
tallahassee
and
augustine
interestingly
enough
the
road
is
at
least
miles
southwest
of
augustine
where
it
passes
through
grandin
the
reason
for
cutting
it
in
such
a
wide
circle
coker
says
was
because
of
the
ferocity
of
the
seminoles
in
the
swamps
north
and
west
of
st
augustine
wagons
carriages
and
stages
passed
along
this
road
in
the
days
before
the
war
between
the
states
coker
says
in
addition
to
these
he
claims
to
have
seen
many
travellers
by
foot
and
not
infrequently
furtive
escaped
slaves
the
latter
usually
under
cover
of
an
appropriate
background
of
darkness
the
road
again
came
into
considerable
use
during
the
late
days
of
the
war
it
was
during
these
days
that
the
federal
troops
both
whites
and
negroes
passed
in
seemingly
endless
procession
on
their
way
to
or
from
encounters
on
one
occasion
the
former
slave
recounts
having
seen
a
procession
of
soldiers
that
took
nearly
two
days
to
pass
they
travelled
on
horse
and
afoot
several
amusing
incidents
are
related
by
the
of
the
events
of
this
period
dozens
of
the
negro
soldiers
he
says
discarded
their
uniforms
for
the
gaudier
clothing
that
had
belonged
to
their
masters
in
former
days
and
could
be
identified
as
soldiers
as
they
passed
only
with
difficulty
others
would
pause
on
their
trip
at
some
plantation
ascertain
the
name
of
the
overseer
on
the
place
then
tie
him
backward
on
a
horse
and
force
him
to
accompany
them
particularly
retributive
were
the
punishments
visited
upon
mays
and
prevatt
generally
recognized
as
the
most
vicious
slave
drivers
of
the
section
bellamy
coker
says
built
the
road
with
slave
labor
and
as
an
investment
realizing
much
money
on
tolls
on
it
for
many
years
a
remarkable
feature
of
the
road
is
that
despite
its
age
and
the
fact
that
county
authorities
have
permitted
its
former
good
grading
to
deterierate
to
an
almost
impassable
sand
at
some
seasons
there
is
no
mistaking
the
fact
that
this
was
once
a
major
thoroughfare
the
region
that
stretches
from
green
cove
springs
in
the
northeast
to
grandin
in
the
southwest
the
former
slave
claims
was
once
dotted
with
lakes
creeks
and
even
a
river
few
of
the
lakes
and
none
of
the
other
bodies
still
exist
however
among
the
more
notable
of
the
bodies
of
water
was
a
stream
he
does
not
now
remember
its
name
that
ran
for
about
miles
in
an
easterly
direction
from
starke
this
stream
was
one
of
the
fastest
that
the
former
slave
can
remember
having
seen
in
florida
its
power
was
utilised
for
the
turning
of
a
power
mill
which
he
believes
ground
corn
or
other
grain
the
falls
in
the
river
that
turned
the
water
mill
he
states
was
at
least
five
or
six
feet
high
and
at
one
point
under
the
falls
a
man
named
or
possibly
nicknamed
yankee
operated
a
sawmill
coker
believes
that
this
mill
too
derived
its
power
from
the
little
stream
he
says
that
the
stream
has
been
extinct
since
he
reached
manhood
it
ended
in
pond
beyond
grandin
and
starke
some
of
the
names
of
the
old
lakes
of
the
section
were
these
brooklyn
lake
magnolia
lake
soldier
pond
near
keystone
pond
near
putnam
hall
hick
lake
and
others
on
one
of
them
was
the
large
grist
mill
of
mccray
coker
suggests
that
this
might
be
the
origin
of
the
town
of
mcrae
of
the
present
period
to
add
to
its
natural
water
facilities
coker
points
out
bradford
county
also
had
a
canal
this
canal
ran
from
the
interior
of
the
county
to
the
john
river
near
green
cove
springs
and
with
mandarin
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
still
a
major
shipping
point
the
canal
handled
much
of
the
commerce
of
bradford
and
clay
counties
coker
recalls
vividly
the
indians
of
the
area
in
the
days
before
these
he
claims
to
have
been
friendly
but
reserved
fellows
he
does
not
recall
any
of
the
indian
women
negro
slaves
from
the
region
around
augustine
and
what
is
now
hastings
used
to
escape
and
use
bellamy
road
on
their
way
to
the
area
about
micanopy
it
was
considered
equivalent
to
freedom
to
reach
that
section
with
its
friendly
indians
and
impenetrable
forests
and
swamps
the
little
town
of
melrose
probably
had
the
most
unusual
name
of
all
the
strange
ones
prevalent
at
the
time
it
was
call
very
simply
coker

no

young

states
that
he
was
born
in
ozark
alabama
june
on
the
plantation
of
charles
davis
who
owned
about
seven
hundred
slaves
and
was
considered
very
wealthy
kindness
and
consideration
for
his
slaves
made
them
love
him
reverend
davis
was
rather
young
during
his
years
in
slavery
but
when
he
was
asked
to
tell
something
about
the
days
of
slavery
replied
i
remember
many
things
about
slavery
but
know
they
will
not
come
to
me
now
anyway
i
tell
what
i
can
think
of
he
tells
of
the
use
of
iron
pots
fireplaces
with
rods
used
to
hold
the
pots
above
the
fire
for
cooking
peas
rice
vegetables
meats
etc
the
coffee
from
meal
spring
and
well
water
tanning
rawhide
for
leather
spinning
of
thread
from
cotton
and
the
weaving
looms
there
was
no
difference
he
states
in
the
treatment
of
men
and
women
for
work
my
parents
worked
very
hard
and
women
did
some
jobs
that
we
would
think
them
crazy
for
trying
now
why
my
mother
helped
build
a
railroad
before
she
was
married
to
my
father
my
mother
first
husband
was
sold
away
from
her
shucks
some
of
the
masters
did
care
how
they
treated
husbands
wives
parents
and
children
any
of
them
might
be
separated
from
the
other
a
good
price
for
a
was
on
down
and
if
one
was
what
was
called
a
stallion
healthy
able
to
get
plenty
children
he
would
bring
about
they
had
what
was
called
legal
money
i
did
have
some
of
it
but
guess
it
was
burned
when
i
lost
my
house
by
fire
a
few
years
ago
now
my
master
had
three
boys
and
two
girls
his
wife
elizabeth
was
about
like
the
ordinary
missus
master
davis
was
good
but
positive
he
did
allow
other
whites
to
bother
his
slaves
when
the
war
came
his
two
boys
went
first
finally
master
davis
went
he
and
one
son
never
returned
the
yankees
killed
cows
as
they
went
along
but
did
not
destroy
any
property
where
i
was
we
had
preachers
and
doctors
but
no
schools
the
white
preachers
told
us
to
obey
and
would
read
the
bible
which
we
could
not
understand
and
told
us
not
to
steal
eggs
most
of
the
doctors
used
herbs
from
the
woods
and
aunt
jane
and
uncle
bob
were
known
for
using
samson
snake
root
devil
for
stomach
troubles
and
myrtle
for
fevers
that
good
now
chile
if
you
can
get
it
the
did
have
a
chance
to
git
in
politics
during
slavery
but
after
emancipation
he
went
immediately
into
the
republican
party
a
few
into
the
democratic
party
there
were
many
other
parties
too
the
religions
were
methodist
and
baptist
my
master
was
baptist
and
that
what
i
am
we
could
attend
church
but
dare
not
try
to
get
any
education
less
we
punished
with
straps
there
are
many
things
i
remember
just
like
it
was
yesterday
the
general
punishment
was
with
straps
some
of
the
slaves
suffered
terribly
on
the
plantations
if
the
master
was
poor
and
had
few
slaves
he
was
mean
the
more
wealthy
or
more
slaves
he
had
the
better
he
was
in
some
cases
it
was
the
general
law
that
made
some
of
the
masters
as
they
were
as
the
law
required
them
to
have
an
overseer
or
foreman
he
was
called
boss
man
by
the
and
usually
came
from
the
lower
or
poorer
classes
of
whites
he
did
like
usually
and
took
authority
to
do
as
he
pleased
with
them
at
times
some
plantations
preferred
and
did
have
riders
that
were
next
to
the
overseer
or
foreman
but
they
were
liked
better
than
the
foreman
and
in
many
instances
were
treated
like
foremen
but
the
law
would
not
let
them
be
called
foremen
some
of
the
masters
stood
between
the
riders
and
foremen
and
some
cases
the
was
really
boss
the
punishments
as
i
said
were
cruel
some
masters
would
hang
the
slaves
up
by
both
thumbs
so
that
their
toes
just
touched
the
floor
women
and
men
alike
many
slaves
ran
away
others
were
forced
by
their
treatment
to
do
all
kinds
of
mean
things
some
slaves
would
dig
deep
holes
along
the
route
of
the
patrollers
and
their
horses
would
fall
in
sometimes
breaking
the
leg
of
the
horse
arm
or
leg
of
the
rider
some
slaves
took
advantage
of
the
protection
their
masters
would
give
them
with
the
overseer
or
other
plantation
owners
would
do
their
devilment
and
fly
to
their
masters
who
did
not
allow
a
man
from
another
plantation
to
bother
his
slaves
i
have
known
pregnant
women
to
go
ten
miles
to
help
do
some
devilment
my
mother
was
a
very
strong
woman
as
i
told
you
she
helped
build
a
railroad
and
felt
that
she
could
whip
any
ordinary
man
would
not
get
a
passport
unless
she
felt
like
it
once
when
caught
on
another
plantation
without
a
passport
she
had
all
of
us
with
her
made
all
of
the
children
run
but
would
run
herself
somehow
she
went
upstream
one
of
the
men
horse
legs
was
broken
and
she
told
him
come
and
get
me
but
she
knew
the
master
allowed
no
one
to
come
on
his
place
to
punish
his
slaves
my
father
was
a
blacksmith
and
made
the
chains
used
for
stocks
like
handcuffs
used
on
legs
and
hands
the
slaves
were
forced
to
lay
flat
on
their
backs
and
were
chained
down
to
the
board
made
for
that
purpose
they
were
left
there
for
hours
sometimes
through
rain
and
cold
he
might
and
groan
but
that
did
not
always
get
him
released
the
race
became
badly
mixed
then
some
negro
women
were
forced
into
association
some
were
beaten
almost
to
death
because
they
refused
the
negro
men
dare
not
bother
or
even
speak
to
some
of
their
women
in
one
instance
an
owner
of
a
plantation
threatened
a
negro
sweetheart
she
told
him
and
he
went
crying
to
this
owner
who
in
turned
threatened
him
and
probably
did
hit
the
woman
straight
to
his
master
this
sweetheart
went
and
when
he
finished
his
story
his
master
immediately
took
his
team
and
drove
to
the
other
plantation
drove
so
fast
that
one
of
his
horses
dropped
dead
when
the
owner
came
out
he
levelled
his
shotgun
at
him
and
shot
him
dead
no
suh
some
masters
did
not
allow
you
to
bother
their
slaves
a
peculiar
case
was
that
of
old
jim
who
lived
on
another
plantation
was
left
to
look
out
for
the
fires
and
do
other
chores
around
the
house
while
was
at
war
a
bad
rumor
spread
and
do
you
know
those
mean
devils
overseers
of
nearby
plantations
came
out
and
got
her
dug
a
deep
hole
and
despite
her
cries
buried
her
up
to
her
neck
nothing
was
left
out
but
her
head
and
hair
a
crowd
of
young
boys
saw
it
all
and
i
was
one
among
the
crowd
that
helped
dig
her
out
oh
there
a
lots
more
i
know
but
just
cant
get
it
together
my
mother
name
was
caroline
and

father
patrick

the
name
of

from
our
master
there
were
thirteen
children
i
am
the
only
one
alive
davis
appears
well
preserved
for
his
age
he
has
most
of
his
teeth
and
is
slightly
gray
his
health
seems
to
be
good
although
he
is
a
cripple
and
uses
a
cane
for
walking
always
this
condition
he
believes
is
the
result
of
an
attack
of
rheumatism
he
is
a
preacher

pastored
in
alabama

of
life
to
lizzie
brown
november
there

no
children
he
gives
no
reason
for
remaining
single
but
his
reason
for
marrying
was
to
give
some

the
privilege
and
see
how
it
feels
to
be

dorsey
an
born
in
suwannee
county
florida
in
fourteen
years
prior
to
freedom
his
parents
charlie
and
anna
dorsey
were
natives
of
maryland
and
free
people
in
those
days
dorsey
relates
there
were
people
known
as
nigger
traders
who
used
any
subterfuge
to
catch
negroes
and
sell
them
into
slavery
there
was
one
jeff
davis
who
was
known
as
a
professional
nigger
trader
his
slave
boat
docked
in
the
slip
at
maryland
and
jeff
davis
and
his
henchmen
went
out
looking
for
their
victims
unfortunately
his
mother
anna
and
his
father
were
caught
one
night
and
were
bound
and
gagged
and
taken
to
jeff
davis
boat
which
was
waiting
in
the
harbor
and
there
they
were
put
into
stocks
the
boat
stayed
in
port
until
it
was
loaded
with
negroes
then
sailed
for
florida
where
davis
disposed
of
his
human
cargo
douglas
dorsey
parents
were
sold
to
colonel
louis
matair
who
had
a
large
plantation
that
was
cultivated
by
slaves
colonel
house
was
of
the
pretentious
southern
colonial
type
which
was
quite
prevalent
during
that
period
the
colonel
had
won
his
title
because
of
his
participation
in
the
indian
war
in
florida
he
was
the
typical
wealthy
southern
gentleman
and
was
very
kind
to
his
slaves
his
wife
however
was
just
the
opposite
she
was
exceedingly
mean
and
could
easily
be
termed
a
tyrant
there
were
several
children
in
the
matair
family
and
their
home
and
plantation
were
located
in
suwannee
county
florida
douglas
parents
were
assigned
to
their
tasks
his
mother
was
and
his
father
was
the
mechanic
having
learned
this
trade
in
maryland
as
a
free
man
charlie
and
anna
had
several
children
and
douglas
was
among
them
when
he
became
large
enough
he
was
kept
in
the
matair
home
to
build
fires
assist
in
serving
meals
and
other
chores
matair
being
a
very
cruel
woman
would
whip
the
slaves
herself
for
any
misdemeanor
dorsey
recalls
an
incident
that
is
hard
to
obliterate
from
his
mind
it
is
as
follows
dorsey
mother
was
called
by
matair
not
hearing
her
she
continued
with
her
duties
suddenly
matair
burst
out
in
a
frenzy
of
anger
over
the
woman
not
answering
anna
explained
that
she
did
not
hear
her
call
thereupon
matair
seized
a
large
butcher
knife
and
struck
at
anna
attempting
to
ward
off
the
blow
anna
received
a
long
gash
on
the
arm
that
laid
her
up
for
for
some
time
young
douglas
was
a
witness
to
this
brutal
treatment
of
his
mother
and
he
at
that
moment
made
up
his
mind
to
kill
his
mistress
he
intended
to
put
strychnine
that
was
used
to
kill
rats
into
her
coffee
that
he
usually
served
her
fortunately
freedom
came
and
saved
him
of
this
act
which
would
have
resulted
in
his
death
he
relates
another
incident
in
regard
to
his
mistress
as
follows
to
his
mother
and
father
was
born
a
little
baby
boy
whose
complexion
was
rather
light
matair
at
once
began
accusing
colonel
matair
as
being
the
father
of
the
child
naturally
the
colonel
denied
but
matair
kept
harassing
him
about
it
until
he
finally
agreed
to
his
wife
desire
and
sold
the
child
it
was
taken
from
its
mother
breast
at
the
age
of
eight
months
and
auctioned
off
on
the
first
day
of
january
to
the
highest
bidder
the
child
was
bought
by
a
captain
ross
and
taken
across
the
suwannee
river
into
hamilton
county
twenty
years
later
he
was
located
by
his
family
he
was
a
grown
man
married
and
farming
young
douglas
had
the
task
each
morning
of
carrying
the
matair
children
books
to
school
willie
a
boy
of
eight
would
teach
douglas
what
he
learned
in
school
finally
douglas
learned
the
alphabet
and
numbers
in
some
way
matair
learned
that
douglas
was
learning
to
read
and
write
one
morning
after
breakfast
she
called
her
son
willie
to
the
dining
room
where
she
was
seated
and
then
sent
for
douglas
to
come
there
too
she
then
took
a
quill
pen
the
kind
used
at
that
time
and
began
writing
the
alphabet
and
numerals
as
far
as
ten
holding
the
paper
up
to
douglas
she
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
they
were
he
proudly
answered
in
the
affirmative
not
suspecting
anything
she
then
asked
him
to
name
the
letters
and
numerals
which
he
did
she
then
asked
him
to
write
them
which
he
did
when
he
reached
the
number
ten
very
proud
of
his
learning
she
struck
him
a
heavy
blow
across
the
face
saying
to
him
if
i
ever
catch
you
making
another
figure
anywhere
i
cut
off
your
right
arm
naturally
douglas
and
also
her
son
willie
were
much
surprised
as
each
thought
what
had
been
done
was
quite
an
achievement
she
then
called
mariah
the
cook
to
bring
a
rope
and
tying
the
two
of
them
to
the
old
colonial
post
on
the
front
porch
she
took
a
chair
and
sat
between
the
two
whipping
them
on
their
naked
backs
for
such
a
time
that
for
two
weeks
their
clothes
stuck
to
their
backs
on
the
lacerated
flesh
to
ease
the
soreness
willie
would
steal
grease
from
the
house
and
together
they
would
slip
into
the
barn
and
grease
each
other
backs
as
to
plantation
life
dorsey
said
that
the
slaves
lived
in
quarters
especially
built
for
them
on
the
plantation
they
would
leave
for
the
fields
at
sun
up
and
remain
until
stopping
only
for
a
meal
which
they
took
along
with
them
instead
of
having
an
overseer
they
had
what
was
called
a
driver
by
the
name
of
januray
tr
his
duties
were
to
get
the
slaves
together
in
the
morning
and
see
that
they
went
to
the
fields
and
assigned
them
to
their
tasks
he
worked
as
the
other
slaves
though
he
had
more
priveliges
he
would
stop
work
at
any
time
he
pleased
and
go
around
to
inspect
the
work
of
the
others
and
thus
rest
himself
most
of
the
orders
from
the
master
were
issued
to
him
the
crops
consisted
of
cotton
corn
cane
and
peas
which
was
raised
in
abundance
when
the
slaves
left
the
fields
they
returned
to
their
cabins
and
after
preparing
and
eating
of
their
evening
meal
they
gathered
around
a
cabin
to
sing
and
moan
songs
seasoned
with
african
melody
then
to
the
tune
of
an
old
fiddle
they
danced
a
dance
called
the
green
corn
dance
and
cut
the
pigeon
wing
sometimes
the
young
men
on
the
plantation
would
slip
away
to
visit
a
girl
on
another
plantation
if
they
were
caught
by
the
patrols
while
on
these
visits
they
would
be
lashed
on
the
bare
backs
as
a
penalty
for
this
offense
a
whipping
post
was
used
for
this
purpose
as
soon
as
one
slave
was
whipped
he
was
given
the
whip
to
whip
his
brother
slave
very
often
the
lashes
would
bring
blood
very
soon
from
the
already
lacerated
skin
but
this
did
not
stop
the
lashing
until
one
had
received
their
due
number
of
lashes
occasionally
the
slaves
were
ordered
to
church
to
hear
a
white
minister
they
were
seated
in
the
front
pews
of
the
master
church
while
the
whites
sat
in
the
rear
the
minister
admonition
to
them
to
honor
their
masters
and
mistresses
and
to
have
no
other
god
but
them
as
we
can
not
see
the
other
god
but
you
can
see
your
master
and
mistress
after
the
services
the
driver
wife
who
could
read
and
write
a
little
would
tell
them
that
what
the
minister
said
was
all
lies
douglas
says
that
he
will
never
forget
when
he
was
a
lad
years
of
age
when
one
evening
he
was
told
to
go
and
tell
the
driver
to
have
all
the
slaves
come
up
to
the
house
soon
the
entire
host
of
about
slaves
were
gathered
there
all
sitting
around
on
stumps
some
standing
the
colonel
son
was
visibly
moved
as
he
told
them
they
were
free
saying
they
could
go
anywhere
they
wanted
to
for
he
had
no
more
to
do
with
them
or
that
they
could
remain
with
him
and
have
half
of
what
was
raised
on
the
plantation
the
slaves
were
happy
at
this
news
as
they
had
hardly
been
aware
that
there
had
been
a
war
going
on
none
of
them
accepted
the
offer
of
the
colonel
to
remain
as
they
were
only
too
glad
to
leaver
the
cruelties
of
the
matair
plantation
dorsey

a
job

in
when
he
was
years
old
ambrose
hilliard
douglass
was
given
a
sound
beating
by
his
north
carolina
master
because
he
attempted
to
refuse
the
mate
that
had
been
given
to
him
with
the
instructions
to
produce
a
healthy
by
her
and
a
long
argument
on
the
value
of
having
good
strong
healthy
children
in
at
the
age
of
ambrose
douglass
welcomed
his
child
into
the
world
the
lives
near
brooksville
in
hernando
county
on
a
farm
that
he
no
longer
attempts
to
tend
now
that
most
of
his
children
have
deserted
the
farm
for
the
more
lucrative
employment
of
the
cities
of
the
phosphate
camps
douglass
was
born
free
in
detroit
in
his
parents
returned
south
to
visit
relatives
still
in
slavery
and
were
soon
reenslaved
themselves
with
their
children
ambrose
was
one
of
these
for
years
he
remained
in
slavery
sometimes
at
the
plantation
of
his
original
master
in
north
carolina
sometimes
in
other
sections
after
he
had
been
sold
to
different
masters
yassuh
i
been
sold
a
lot
of
times
the
old
man
states
our
master
did
believe
in
keeping
a
house
a
horse
or
a
darky
after
he
had
a
chance
to
make
some
money
on
him
mostly
though
i
was
sold
when
i
cut
up
i
was
a
young
man
he
continues
and
did
see
why
i
should
be
anybody
slave
i
run
away
every
chance
i
got
sometimes
they
near
killed
me
but
mostly
they
just
sold
me
i
guess
i
was
pretty
husky
at
that
they
never
did
get
their
money
worth
out
of
me
though
i
worked
as
long
as
they
stood
over
me
then
i
ran
around
with
the
gals
or
sneaked
off
to
the
woods
sometimes
they
used
to
put
dogs
on
me
to
get
me
back
when
they
finally
sold
me
to
a
man
up
in
suwannee
county
his
name
was
harris
i
thought
it
would
be
the
end
of
the
world
we
had
heard
about
him
all
the
way
up
in
virginia
they
said
he
beat
you
starved
you
and
tied
you
up
when
you
did
work
and
killed
you
if
you
ran
away
but
i
never
had
a
better
master
he
never
beat
me
and
always
fed
all
of
us
we
did
get
too
much
to
eat
corn
meal
a
little
piece
of
fat
meat
now
and
then
cabbages
greens
potatoes
and
plenty
of
molasses
when
i
worked
up
at
house
i
et
just
what
the
master
et
sometimes
he
would
give
it
to
me
when
he
did
i
et
it
anyway
he
was
so
good
and
i
was
so
scared
of
him
till
i
did
ever
run
away
from
his
place
ambrose
reminisces
i
had
somebody
there
that
i
liked
anyway
when
he
finally
went
to
the
war
he
sold
me
back
to
a
man
in
north
carolina
in
hornett
county
but
the
war
was
near
over
then
i
soon
was
as
free
as
i
am
now
i
guess
we
musta
celebrated
about
twelve
times
in
hornett
county
every
time
a
bunch
of
sojers
would
come
through
they
would
tell
us
we
was
free
and
we
begin
celebratin
before
we
would
get
through
somebody
else
would
tell
us
to
go
back
to
work
and
we
would
go
some
of
us
wanted
to
jine
up
with
the
army
but
did
know
who
was
goin
to
win
and
did
take
no
chances
i
was
when
freedom
finally
came
and
that
time
i
did
take
no
chances
on
taking
it
back
again
i
lit
out
for
florida
and
wound
up
in
madison
county
i
had
a
nice
time
there
i
got
married
got
a
plenty
of
work
and
made
me
a
little
money
i
fixed
houses
built
worked
around
the
yards
and
did
everything
my
first
child
was
already
born
i
did
know
there
was
goin
to
be
more
though
i
guess
i
would
have
stopped
right
there
i
stayed
in
madison
county
until
they
started
to
working
concrete
rock
down
here
i
heard
about
it
and
thought
that
would
be
a
good
way
for
me
to
feed
all
them
two
dozen
children
i
had
so
i
came
down
this
side
that
was
about
years
ago
i
got
married

willie
tr
dukes
jovially
declares
that
he
is
on
the
high
road
to
livin
a
years
he
was
one
of
slaves
belonging
to
one
john
dukes
who
was
only
in
moderate
circumstances
his
parents
were
amos
and
mariah
dukes
both
born
on
this
plantation
he
thinks
as
they
were
a
healthy
pair
they
were
required
to
work
long
hours
in
the
fields
although
the
master
was
not
actually
cruel
to
them
on
this
plantation
a
variety
of
products
was
grown
cotton
corn
potatoes
peas
rice
and
sugar
cane
nothing
was
thrown
away
and
the
slaves
had
only
coarse
foods
such
as
corn
bread
collard
greens
peas
and
occasionally
a
little
rice
or
white
bread
even
the
potatoes
were
reserved
for
the
white
folk
and
house
niggers
as
a
child
willis
was
required
to
tote
water
and
wood
help
at
milking
time
and
run
errands
his
clothing
consisted
of
only
a
homespun
shirt
that
was
made
on
the
plantation
nearly
everything
used
was
grown
or
manufactured
on
the
plantation
candles
were
made
in
the
big
house
by
the
cook
and
a
batch
of
slaves
from
the
quarters
all
of
them
being
required
to
bring
fat
and
tallow
that
had
been
saved
for
this
purpose
these
candles
were
for
the
use
of
the
master
and
mistress
as
the
slaves
used
fat
lightwood
torches
for
lighting
purposes
cotton
was
used
for
making
clothes
and
it
was
spun
and
woven
into
cloth
by
the
slave
women
then
stored
in
the
commisary
for
future
use
broggan
shoes
were
made
of
tanned
leather
held
together
by
tacks
made
of
maple
wood
lye
soap
was
made
in
large
pots
cut
into
chunks
and
issued
from
the
smoke
house
potash
was
secured
from
the
ashes
of
burnt
oak
wood
and
allowed
to
set
in
a
quantity
of
grease
that
had
also
been
saved
for
the
purpose
then
boiled
into
soap
the
cotton
was
gathered
in
bags
of
bear
grass
and
deposited
in
baskets
woven
with
strips
of
white
oak
that
had
been
dried
in
the
sun
willis
remembers
the
time
when
a
slave
on
the
plantation
escaped
and
went
north
to
live
this
man
managed
to
communicate
with
his
family
somehow
and
it
was
whispered
about
that
he
was
living
very
high
and
actually
saving
money
with
which
to
buy
his
family
he
was
even
going
to
school
this
fired
all
the
slaves
with
an
ambition
to
go
north
and
this
made
them
more
than
usually
interested
in
the
outcome
of
the
war
between
the
states
he
was
too
young
to
fully
understand
the
meaning
of
freedom
but
wanted
very
much
to
go
away
to
some
place
where
he
could
earn
enough
money
to
buy
his
mother
a
real
silk
dress
he
confided
this
information
to
her
and
she
was
very
proud
of
him
but
gave
him
a
good
spanking
for
fear
he
expressed
this
desire
for
freedom
to
his
young
master
or
mistress
prayer
meetings
were
very
frequent
during
the
days
of
the
war
and
very
often
the
slaves
were
called
in
from
the
fields
and
excused
from
their
labors
so
they
could
hold
these
prayer
meetings
always
praying
god
for
the
safe
return
of
their
master
the
master
did
not
return
after
the
war
and
when
the
soldiers
in
blue
came
through
that
section
the
frightened
women
were
greatly
dependent
upon
their
slaves
for
protection
and
livelihood
many
of
these
black
man
chose
loyalty
to
their
dead
masters
to
freedom
and
shouldered
the
burden
of
the
support
of
their
former
mistresses
cheerfully
after
the
war
willis
father
was
one
of
those
to
remain
with
his
widowed
mistress
other
members
of
his
family
left
as
soon
as
they
were
freed
even
his
wife
they
thus
remained
separated
until
her
death
willis
saw
his
first
bedspring
about
years
ago
and
he
still
thinks
a
feather
mattress
superior
to
the
variety
he
recalls
a
humorous
incident
which
occurred
when
he
was
a
child
and
had
been
introduced
for
the
first
time
to
the
task
of
picking
a
goose
after
demonstrating
how
it
was
done
to
a
group
of
slave
children
the
person
in
charge
had
gone
about
his
way
leaving
them
busily
engaged
in
picking
the
goose
they
had
been
told
that
the
one
gathering
the
most
feathers
would
receive
a
piece
of
money
sometimes
later
the
overseer
returned
to
find
a
dozen
geese
that
had
been
stripped
of
all
the
feathers
they
had
been
told
to
pick
only
the
pin
feathers
beneath
the
wings
and
about
the
bodies
of
the
geese
need
we
guess
what
happened
to
the
over
ambitious
children
he
had
heard
of
ice
long
before
he
looked
upon
it
and
he
only
thought
of
it
as
another
wild
experiment
why
buy
ice
when
watermelons
and
butter
could
be
ley
down
into
the
well
to
keep
cool
one
of
willis
happiest
moments
was
when
he
earned
enough
money
to
buy
his
first
pair
of
patern
leather
shoes
to
possess
a
paid
of
store
bought
shoes
had
been
his
ambition
since
he
was
a
child
when
he
had
to
shine
the
shoes
of
his
master
and
those
of
the
master
children
he
next
owned
a
horse
and
buggy
of
which
he
was
very
proud
this
increased
his
popularity
with
the
girls
and
bye
and
bye
he
was
married
to
mary
a
girl
with
whom
he
had
been
reared
nobody
was
surprised
but
mary
explained
dukes
me
and
everybody
else
knowed
us
ud
get
married
some
day
we
did
jump
over
no
broom
neither
we
was
married
like
white
folks
wid
flowers
and
cake
and
everything
willis
dukes
has
been
in
florida
for
lawd
knows
how
long
and
prefers
this
state
to
his
home
state

a
few

everett
sam
and
louise
everett
and
years
of
age
respectively
have
weathered
together
some
of
the
worst
experiences
of
slavery
and
as
they
look
back
over
the
years
can
relate
these
experiences
as
clearly
as
if
they
had
happened
only
yesterday
both
were
born
near
norfolk
virginia
and
sold
as
slaves
several
times
on
nearby
plantations
it
was
on
the
plantation
of
big
jim
mcclain
that
they
met
as
and
departed
after
emancipation
to
live
the
lives
of
free
people
sam
was
the
son
of
peter
and
betsy
everett
field
hands
who
spent
long
hours
in
the
cotton
fields
and
came
home
at
nightfall
to
cultivate
their
small
garden
they
lived
in
constant
fear
that
their
master
would
confiscate
most
of
their
vegetables
he
so
often
did
louisa
remembers
little
about
her
parents
and
thinks
that
she
was
sold
at
an
early
age
to
a
separate
master
her
name
as
nearly
as
she
could
remember
was
norfolk
virginia
everyone
called
her
nor
it
was
not
until
after
she
was
freed
and
had
sent
her
children
to
school
that
she
changed
her
name
to
louisa
sam
and
norfolk
spent
part
of
their
childhood
on
the
plantation
of
big
jim
who
was
very
cruel
often
he
would
whip
his
slaves
into
insensibility
for
minor
offences
he
sometimes
hung
them
up
by
their
thumbs
whenever
they
were
caught
attempting
to
escape
er
fer
no
reason
atall
on
this
plantation
were
more
than
slaves
who
were
mated
indiscriminately
and
without
any
regard
for
family
unions
if
their
master
thought
that
a
certain
man
and
woman
might
have
strong
healthy
offspring
he
forced
them
to
have
sexual
relation
even
though
they
were
married
to
other
slaves
if
there
seemed
to
be
any
slight
reluctance
on
the
part
of
either
of
the
unfortunate
ones
big
jim
would
make
them
consummate
this
relationship
in
his
presence
he
used
the
same
procedure
if
he
thought
a
certain
couple
was
not
producing
children
fast
enough
he
enjoyed
these
orgies
very
much
and
often
entertained
his
friends
in
this
manner
quite
often
he
and
his
guests
would
engage
in
these
debaucheries
choosing
for
themselves
the
prettiest
of
the
young
women
sometimes
they
forced
the
unhappy
husbands
and
lovers
of
their
victims
to
look
on
louisa
and
sam
were
married
in
a
very
revolting
manner
to
quote
the
woman
marse
jim
called
me
and
sam
ter
him
and
ordered
sam
to
pull
off
his
shirt
that
was
all
the
mcclain
niggers
wore
and
he
said
to
me
do
you
think
you
can
stand
this
big
nigger
he
had
that
old
bull
whip
flung
acrost
his
shoulder
and
lawd
that
man
could
hit
so
hard
so
i
jes
said
i
guess
so
and
tried
to
hide
my
face
so
i
see
sam
nakedness
but
he
made
me
look
at
him
anyhow
well
he
told
us
what
we
must
git
busy
and
do
in
his
presence
and
we
had
to
do
it
after
that
we
were
considered
man
and
wife
me
and
sam
was
a
healthy
pair
and
had
fine
big
babies
so
i
never
had
another
man
forced
on
me
thank
god
sam
was
kind
to
me
and
i
learnt
to
love
him
life
on
the
mcclain
plantation
was
a
steady
grind
of
work
from
morning
until
night
slaves
had
to
rise
in
the
dark
of
the
morning
at
the
ringing
of
the
big
house
bell
after
eating
a
hasty
breakfast
of
fried
fat
pork
and
corn
pone
they
worked
in
the
fields
until
the
bell
rang
again
at
noon
at
which
time
they
ate
boiled
vegetables
roasted
sweet
potatoes
and
black
molasses
this
food
was
cooked
in
iron
pots
which
had
legs
attached
to
their
bottoms
in
order
to
keep
them
from
resting
directly
on
the
fire
these
utensils
were
either
hung
over
a
fire
or
set
atop
a
mound
of
hot
coals
biscuits
were
a
luxury
but
whenever
they
had
white
bread
it
was
cooked
in
another
thick
pan
called
a
spider
this
pan
had
a
top
which
was
covered
with
hot
embers
to
insure
the
browning
of
the
bread
on
top
slave
women
had
no
time
for
their
children
these
were
cared
for
by
an
old
woman
who
called
them
twice
a
day
and
fed
them
pot
likker
vegetable
broth
and
skimmed
milk
each
child
was
provided
with
a
wooden
laddle
which
he
dipped
into
a
wooden
trough
and
fed
himself
the
older
children
fed
those
who
were
too
young
to
hold
a
laddle
so
exacting
was
big
jim
that
slaves
were
forced
to
work
even
when
sick
expectant
mothers
toiled
in
the
fields
until
they
felt
their
labor
pains
it
was
not
uncommon
for
babies
to
be
born
in
the
fields
there
was
little
time
for
play
on
his
plantation
even
the
very
small
children
were
assigned
tasks
they
hunted
hen
eggs
gathered
poke
berries
for
dyeing
shelled
corn
and
drove
the
cows
home
in
the
evening
little
girls
knitted
stockings
there
was
no
church
on
this
plantation
and
itinerant
ministers
avoided
going
there
because
of
the
owner
cruelty
very
seldom
were
the
slaves
allowed
to
attend
neighboring
churches
and
still
rarer
were
the
opportunities
to
hold
meetings
among
themselves
often
when
they
were
in
the
middle
of
a
song
or
prayer
they
would
be
forced
to
halt
and
run
to
the
big
house
woe
to
any
slave
who
ignored
the
ringing
of
the
bell
that
summoned
him
to
work
and
told
him
when
he
might
knock
off
from
his
labors
louisa
and
sam
last
heard
the
ringing
of
this
bell
in
the
fall
of
all
the
slaves
gathered
in
front
of
the
big
house
to
be
told
that
they
were
free
for
the
time
being
they
had
heard
whisperings
of
the
war
but
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
it
all
now
big
jim
stood
weeping
on
the
piazza
and
cursing
the
fate
that
had
been
so
cruel
to
him
by
robbing
him
of
all
his
niggers
he
inquired
if
any
wanted
to
remain
until
all
the
crops
were
harvested
and
when
no
one
consented
to
do
so
he
flew
into
a
rage
seizing
his
pistol
he
began
firing
into
the
crowd
of
frightened
negroes
some
were
outright
and
others
were
maimed
for
life
finally
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
stop
he
then
attempted
to
take
his
own
life
a
few
frightened
slaves
promised
to
remain
with
him
another
year
this
placated
him
it
was
necessary
for
union
soldiers
to
make
another
visit
to
the
plantation
before
big
jim
would
allow
his
former
slaves
to
depart
sam
and
louisa
moved
to
boston
georgia
where
they
sharecropped
for
several
years
they
later
bought
a
small
farm
when
their
two
sons
became
old
enough
to
help
they
continued
to
live
on
this
homestead
until
a
few
years
ago
when
their
advancing
ages
made
it
necessary
that
they
live
with
the
children
both
of
the
children
had
settled
in
florida
several
years
previous
and
wanted
their
parents
to
come
to
them
they
now
live
in
mulberry
florida
with
the
younger
son
both
are
pitifully
infirm
but
can
still
remember
the
horrors
they
experienced
under
very
cruel
owners
it
was
with
difficulty
that
they
were
prevailed
upon
to
relate
some
of
the
gruesome
details

duncan
gaines
duncan
gaines
the
son
of
george
and
martha
gaines
was
born
on
a
plantation
in
virginia
on
march
he
was
one
of
four
children
all
fortunate
enough
to
remain
with
their
parents
until
maturity
they
were
sold
many
times
but
duncan
gaines
best
remembers
the
master
who
was
known
as
old
man
beever
on
this
plantation
were
about
slaves
who
toiled
all
day
in
the
cotton
and
tobacco
fields
and
came
home
at
dusk
to
cook
their
meals
of
corn
pone
collards
and
sweet
potatoes
on
the
hearths
of
their
one
room
cabins
biscuits
were
baked
on
special
occasions
by
placing
hot
coals
atop
the
iron
tops
of
long
legged
frying
pans
called
spiders
and
the
potatoes
were
roasted
in
the
ashes
likewise
the
corn
pone
their
masters
being
more
or
less
kind
there
was
pork
chicken
syrup
and
other
foodstuffs
that
they
were
allowed
to
raise
as
their
own
on
a
small
scale
this
work
was
often
done
by
the
light
of
a
torch
at
night
as
they
had
little
time
of
their
own
in
this
way
slaves
earned
money
for
small
luxuries
and
the
more
ambitious
sometimes
saved
enough
money
to
buy
their
freedom
although
this
was
not
encouraged
very
much
the
early
life
of
duncan
was
carefree
and
happy
with
the
exception
of
carrying
water
to
the
laborers
and
running
errands
he
had
little
to
do
most
of
the
time
of
the
slave
children
was
spent
in
playing
ball
and
wrestling
and
foraging
the
woods
for
berries
and
fruits
and
playing
games
as
other
children
they
were
often
joined
in
their
play
by
the
master
children
who
taught
them
to
read
and
write
and
fired
duncan
with
the
ambition
to
be
free
so
that
he
could
wear
a
frill
on
his
colar
and
own
a
pair
of
shoes
that
did
not
have
brass
caps
on
the
toes
and
require
the
application
of
fat
to
make
them
shine
wearing
his
shoes
shined
as
explained
above
and
a
coarse
homespun
suit
dyed
with
oak
bark
indigo
or
poke
berries
he
went
to
church
on
sunday
afternoons
after
the
whites
had
had
their
services
and
listened
to
sermons
delivered
by
white
ministers
who
taught
obedience
to
their
masters
after
the
services
most
of
the
slaves
would
remove
their
shoes
and
carry
them
in
their
hands
as
they
were
unaccustomed
to
wearing
shoes
except
in
winter
the
women
were
given
saturday
afternoons
off
to
launder
their
clothes
and
prepare
for
sunday
services
all
slaves
were
required
to
appear
on
monday
mornings
as
clean
as
possible
with
their
clothing
mended
and
heads
combed
lye
soap
was
used
both
for
laundering
and
bathing
it
was
made
from
fragments
of
fat
meat
and
skins
that
were
carefully
saved
for
that
purpose
potash
was
secured
from
oak
ashes
this
mixture
was
allowed
to
set
for
a
certain
period
of
time
then
cooked
to
a
consistency
after
cooling
the
soap
was
cut
into
square
bars
and
lowanced
out
allowance
to
the
slaves
according
to
the
number
in
each
family
once
duncan
was
given
a
bar
of
sweet
soap
by
his
mistress
for
doing
a
particularly
nice
piece
of
work
of
polishing
the
harness
of
her
favorite
mare
and
so
proud
was
he
of
the
gift
that
he
put
it
among
his
sunday
clothes
to
make
them
smell
sweet
it
was
the
first
piece
of
toilet
sopa
that
he
had
ever
seen
and
it
caused
quite
a
bit
of
envy
among
the
other
slave
children
duncan
gaines
does
not
remember
his
grandparents
but
thinks
they
were
both
living
on
some
nearby
plantation
his
father
was
the
plantation
blacksmith
and
duncan
liked
to
look
on
as
plowshares
single
trees
horse
shoes
etc
were
turned
out
or
sharpened
his
mother
was
strong
and
healthy
so
she
toiled
all
day
in
the
fields
duncan
always
listened
for
his
mother
return
from
the
field
which
was
heraled
by
a
song
no
matter
how
tired
she
was
she
was
very
fond
of
her
children
and
did
not
share
the
attitude
of
many
slave
mother
who
thought
of
their
children
as
belonging
solely
to
the
masters
she
lived
in
constant
fear
that
old
marse
seever
would
meet
with
some
adversity
and
be
forced
to
sell
them
separately
she
always
whispered
to
them
about
de
war
and
fanned
to
a
flame
their
desire
to
be
free
at
that
time
negro
children
listened
to
the
tales
of
head
and
bloody
various
animal
stories
and
such
childish
ditties
as
little
boy
little
boy
who
made
your
breeches
mamma
cut
out
and
pappa
sewed
de
stitches
children
were
told
that
babies
were
dug
out
of
tree
stumps
and
were
generally
made
to
shut
up
if
they
questioned
their
elders
about
such
matters
children
with
long
or
large
heads
were
thought
to
be
marked
to
become
wise
men
everyone
believed
in
ghosts
and
entertained
all
the
superstitions
that
have
been
handed
down
to
the
present
generation
there
was
much
talk
of
hoodooism
and
anyone
ill
for
a
long
time
without
getting
relief
from
herb
medicines
was
thought
to
be
fixed
or
suffering
from
some
sin
that
his
father
had
committed
duncan
was
years
of
age
when
freedom
was
declared
and
remembers
the
hectic
times
which
followed
he
and
other
slave
children
attended
schools
provided
by
the
freedmen
aid
and
other
social
organizations
fostered
by
northerners
most
of
the
instructors
were
whites
sent
to
the
south
for
that
purpose
the
gaines
were
industrious
and
soon
owned
a
prosperous
farm
they
seldom
had
any
money
but
had
plenty
of
foodstuffs
and
clothing
and
a
fairly
comfortable
home
all
of
the
children
secured
enough
learning
to
enable
them
to
read
and
write
which
was
regarded
as
very
unusual
in
those
days
slaves
had
been
taught
that
their
brain
was
inferior
to
the
whites
who
owned
them
and
for
this
reason
many
parents
refused
to
send
their
children
to
school
thinking
it
a
waste
of
time
and
that
too
much
learning
might
cause
some
injury
to
the
brain
of
their
supposedly
children
of
the
various
changes
duncan
remembers
very
little
so
gradual
did
they
occur
in
his
section
water
was
secured
from
the
spring
or
well
perishable
foodstuffs
were
let
down
into
the
well
to
keep
cool
shoes
were
made
from
leather
tanned
by
setting
in
a
solution
of
red
oak
bark
and
water
laundering
was
done
in
wooden
tubs
made
from
barrels
cut
in
halves
candles
were
used
for
lighting
and
were
made
from
sheep
and
beef
tallow
lightwood
torches
were
used
by
those
not
able
to
afford
candles
stockings
were
knitted
by
the
women
during
cold
or
rainy
weather
weaving
and
spinning
done
by
special
slave
women
who
were
too
old
to
work
in
the
fields
others
made
the
cloth
into
garments
everything
was
done
by
hand
except
the
luxuries
imported
by
the
wealthy
duncan
gaines
is
now
a
widower
and
fast
becoming
infirm
he
looks
upon
this
new
fangled
age
with
bare
tolerance
and
feels
that
the
happiest
age
of
mankind
has
passed
with
the
discarding
of
the
simple
old
fashioned
way
of
doing
things

children
they
wuz
white
doctors
and
plenty
of
colored
grannies
when
de
yankees
came
they
acted
diffunt
and
was
naturally
better
to
servants
than
our
masters
had
been
we
colored
folks
done
the
best
we
could
but
that
was
not
so
good
right
after
freedom
still
it
growed
on
and
growed
on
getting
better
before
freedom
we
always
went
to
white
churches
on
sundays
with
passes
but
they
never
mentioned
god
they
always
told
us
to
be
good
niggers
and
mind
our
missus
and
masters
judge
williams
had
ten
or
twelve
heads
of

she
was
lak
marse
williams
i
had
eighteen
head
of
boys
and
five
girls
myself
dere
was
so
many
i
can
all
of
dem
gantling
was
asked
to
relate
some
incidents
that
he
could
remember
of
the
lives
of
slaves
and
he
continued
well
the
horn
would
blow
every
morning
for
you
to
git
up
and
go
right
to
work
when
the
sun
ris
if
you
were
not
in
the
field
working
you
would
be
whipped
with
whips
and
leather
strops
i
aunt
beaty
was
beat
until
she
could
hardly
get
along
but
i
can
what
for
but
do
you
know
she
had
to
work
along
till
she
got
better
my
ma
had
to
work
pretty
hard
but
my
oldest
sister
judy
was
too
young
to
work
much
a
heap
of
de
slaves
would
run
away
and
hide
in
de
woods
to
keep
from
working
so
hard
but
the
white
folks
to
keep
them
from
running
away
so
that
they
could
not
ketch
would
put
a
chain
around
the
neck
which
would
hang
down
the
back
and
be
fastened
on
to
another
the
waist
and
another
the
feet
so
they
could
not
run
still
they
had
to
work
and
sleep
in
too
sometimes
they
would
wear
these
chains
for
three
or
four
months
when
a
slave
would
die
they
had
wooden
boxes
to
put
in
and
dug
holes
and
just
put
then
in
a
slave
might
go
to
a
sister
or
funeral
my
recollection
is
very
bad
and
so
much
is
forgotten
but
i
have
seen
slaves
sold
in
droves
like
cows
they
called
and
white
men
wuz
drivin
like
hogs
and
cows
for
sale
mothers
and
fathers
were
sold
and
parted
from
their
chillun
they
wuz
sold
to
white

he
jes

he
would
ask
him
if

would
give
him

with
arnold

whose
early
life
was
spent
helping
slaves
to
freedom
across
the
ohio
river
while
he
himself
remained
in
bondage
as
he
puts
it
he
guesses
he
could
be
called
a
on
the
underground
railway
only
we
call
it
that
then
i
do
know
as
we
called
it
anything
we
just
knew
there
was
a
lot
of
slaves
always
to
get
free
and
i
had
to
help
most
of
the
slaves
did
know
when
they
was
born
but
i
did
you
see
i
was
born
on
a
christmas
mornin
it
was
in
i
was
a
full
grown
man
when
i
finally
got
my
freedom
before
i
got
it
though
i
helped
a
lot
of
others
get
theirs
lawd
only
knows
how
many
might
have
been
as
much
as
hundred
it
was
more
than
a
hundred
i
know
but
that
all
came
after
i
was
a
young
man
enough
to
know
a
pretty
girl
when
i
saw
one
and
to
go
chasing
after
her
too
i
was
born
on
a
plantation
that
to
jack
tabb
in
mason
county
just
across
the
river
in
kentucky
tabb
was
a
pretty
good
man
he
used
to
beat
us
sure
but
not
nearly
so
much
as
others
did
some
of
his
own
kin
people
even
but
he
was
kinda
funny
sometimes
he
used
to
have
a
special
slave
who
have
nothin
to
do
but
teach
the
rest
of
us
we
had
about
ten
on
the
plantation
and
a
lot
on
the
other
plantations
near
us
how
to
read
and
write
and
figger
tabb
liked
us
to
know
how
to
figger
but
sometimes
when
he
would
send
for
us
and
we
would
be
a
long
time
comin
he
would
ask
us
where
we
had
been
if
we
told
him
we
had
been
learnin
to
read
he
would
near
beat
the
daylights
out
of
us
after
gettin
somebody
to
teach
us
i
think
he
did
some
of
that
so
that
the
other
owners
say
he
was
spoilin
his
slaves
he
was
funny
about
us
marryin
too
he
would
let
us
go
on
the
other
plantations
near
anytime
we
liked
if
we
were
good
and
if
we
found
somebody
we
wanted
to
marry
and
she
was
on
a
plantation
that
to
one
of
his
kin
folks
or
a
friend
he
would
swap
a
slave
so
that
the
husband
and
wife
could
be
together
sometimes
when
he
do
this
he
would
let
a
slave
work
all
day
on
his
plantation
and
live
with
his
wife
at
night
on
her
plantation
some
of
the
other
owners
was
always
talking
about
his
spoilin
us
he
was
a
dimmacrat
like
the
rest
of
in
the
county
he
belonged
to
the
party
and
he
was
a
real
leader
in
it
he
used
to
always
be
makin
speeches
and
sometimes
his
best
friends
would
be
speaking
to
him
for
days
at
a
time
tabb
was
always
specially
good
to
me
he
used
to
let
me
go
all
about
i
guess
he
had
to
could
get
too
much
work
out
of
me
even
when
he
kept
me
right
under
his
eyes
i
learned
fast
too
and
i
think
he
kinda
liked
that
he
used
to
call
sandy
davis
the
slave
who
taught
me
smartest
nigger
in
kentucky
it
was
he
used
to
let
me
go
around
in
the
day
and
night
so
much
that
i
came
to
be
the
one
who
carried
the
runnin
away
slaves
over
the
river
it
was
funny
the
way
i
started
it
too
i
did
have
no
idea
of
ever
gettin
mixed
up
in
any
sort
of
business
like
that
until
one
special
night
i
had
even
thought
of
rowing
across
the
river
myself
but
one
night
i
had
gone
on
another
plantation
and
the
old
woman
whose
house
i
went
to
told
me
she
had
a
real
pretty
girl
there
who
wanted
to
go
across
the
river
and
would
i
take
her
i
was
scared
and
backed
out
in
a
hurry
but
then
i
saw
the
girl
and
she
was
such
a
pretty
little
thing
and
kinda
rosy
and
looking
as
scared
as
i
was
feelin
so
it
was
long
before
i
was
listenin
to
the
old
woman
tell
me
when
to
take
her
and
where
to
leave
her
on
the
other
side
i
did
have
nerve
enough
to
do
it
that
night
though
and
i
told
them
to
wait
for
me
until
tomorrow
night
all
the
next
day
i
kept
seeing
mister
tabb
laying
a
rawhide
across
my
back
or
shootin
me
and
kept
seeing
that
scared
little
brown
girl
back
at
the
house
looking
at
me
with
her
big
eyes
and
asking
me
if
i
would
just
row
her
across
to
ripley
me
and
tabb
lost
and
soon
as
dust
settled
that
night
i
was
at
the
old
lady
house
i
do
know
how
i
ever
rowed
the
boat
across
the
river
the
current
was
strong
and
i
was
trembling
i
could
see
a
thing
there
in
the
dark
but
i
felt
that
girl
eyes
we
did
dare
to
whisper
so
i
could
tell
her
how
sure
i
was
that
tabb
or
some
of
the
others
owners
would
me
up
when
they
found
out
what
i
had
done
i
just
knew
they
would
find
out
i
was
worried
too
about
where
to
put
her
out
of
the
boat
i
ride
her
across
the
river
all
night
and
i
did
know
a
thing
about
the
other
side
i
had
heard
a
lot
about
it
from
other
slaves
but
i
thought
it
was
just
about
like
mason
county
with
slaves
and
masters
overseers
and
rawhides
and
so
i
just
knew
that
if
i
pulled
the
boat
up
and
went
to
asking
people
where
to
take
her
i
would
get
a
beating
or
get
killed
i
do
know
whether
it
seemed
like
a
long
time
or
a
short
time
now
it
so
long
ago
i
know
it
was
a
long
time
rowing
there
in
the
cold
and
worryin
but
it
was
short
too
as
soon
as
i
did
get
on
the
other
side
the
girl
would
be
gone
well
pretty
soon
i
saw
a
tall
light
and
i
remembered
what
the
old
lady
had
told
me
about
looking
for
that
light
and
rowing
to
it
i
did
and
when
i
got
up
to
it
two
men
reached
down
and
grabbed
her
i
started
tremblin
all
over
again
and
prayin
then
one
of
the
men
took
my
arm
and
i
just
felt
down
inside
of
me
that
the
lord
had
got
ready
for
me
hungry
boy
is
what
he
asked
me
and
if
he
had
been
holdin
me
i
think
i
would
have
fell
backward
into
the
river
that
was
my
first
trip
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
get
over
my
scared
feelin
but
i
finally
did
and
i
soon
found
myself
goin
back
across
the
river
with
two
and
three
people
and
sometimes
a
whole
boatload
i
got
so
i
used
to
make
three
and
four
trips
a
month
what
did
my
passengers
look
like
i
ca
tell
you
any
more
about
it
than
you
can
and
you
was
there
after
that
first
girl
no
i
never
did
see
her
again
i
never
saw
my
passengers
i
would
have
to
be
the
black
nights
of
the
moon
when
i
would
carry
them
and
i
would
meet
out
in
the
open
or
in
a
house
without
a
single
light
the
only
way
i
knew
who
they
were
was
to
ask
them
what
you
say
and
they
would
answer
menare
i
do
know
what
that
word
meant
it
came
from
the
bible
i
only
know
that
that
was
the
password
i
used
and
all
of
them
that
i
took
over
told
it
to
me
before
i
took
them
i
guess
you
wonder
what
i
did
with
them
after
i
got
them
over
the
river
well
there
in
ripley
was
a
man
named
rankins
i
think
the
rest
of
his
name
was
john
he
had
a
regular
station
there
on
his
place
for
escaping
slaves
you
see
ohio
was
a
free
state
and
once
they
got
over
the
river
from
kentucky
or
virginia
rankins
could
strut
them
all
around
town
and
nobody
would
bother
the
only
reason
we
used
to
land
quietly
at
night
was
so
that
whoever
brought
could
go
back
for
more
and
because
we
had
to
be
careful
that
none
of
the
owners
had
followed
us
every
once
in
a
while
they
would
follow
a
boat
and
catch
their
slaves
back
sometimes
they
would
shoot
at
whoever
was
trying
to
save
the
poor
devils
rankins
had
a
regular
for
the
slaves
he
had
a
big
lighthouse
in
his
yard
about
thirty
feet
high
and
he
kept
it
all
night
it
always
meant
freedom
for
slave
if
he
could
get
to
this
light
sometimes
rankins
would
have
twenty
or
thirty
slaves
that
had
run
away
on
his
place
at
the
time
it
must
have
cost
him
a
whole
lots
to
keep
them
and
feed
but
i
think
some
of
his
friends
helped
him
those
who
wanted
to
stay
around
that
part
of
ohio
could
stay
but
did
many
of
do
it
because
there
was
too
much
danger
that
you
would
be
walking
along
free
one
night
feel
a
hand
over
your
mouth
and
be
back
across
the
river
and
in
slavery
again
in
the
morning
and
nobody
in
the
world
ever
got
a
chance
to
know
as
much
misery
as
a
slave
that
had
escaped
and
been
caught
so
a
whole
lot
of
went
on
north
to
other
parts
of
ohio
or
to
new
york
chicago
or
canada
canada
was
popular
then
because
all
of
the
slaves
thought
it
was
the
last
gate
before
you
got
all
the
way
of
heaven
i
do
think
there
was
much
chance
for
a
slave
to
make
a
living
in
canada
but
did
many
of
come
back
they
seem
like
they
rather
starve
up
there
in
the
cold
than
to
be
back
in
slavery
the
army
soon
started
taking
a
lot
of
too
they
could
enlist
in
the
union
army
and
get
good
wages
more
food
than
they
ever
had
and
have
all
the
little
gals
wavin
at
when
they
passed
them
blue
uniforms
was
a
nice
change
too
no
i
never
got
anything
from
a
single
one
of
the
people
i
carried
over
the
river
to
freedom
i
did
want
anything
after
had
made
a
few
trips
i
got
to
like
it
and
even
though
i
could
have
been
free
any
night
myself
i
figgered
i
was
getting
along
so
bad
so
i
would
stay
on
tabb
place
and
help
the
others
get
free
i
did
it
for
four
years
i
do
know
to
this
day
how
he
never
knew
what
i
was
doing
i
used
to
take
some
awful
chances
and
he
knew
i
must
have
been
up
to
something
i
would
do
much
work
in
the
day
would
never
be
in
my
house
at
night
and
when
he
would
happen
to
visit
the
plantation
where
i
had
said
i
was
goin
i
would
be
there
sometimes
i
think
he
did
know
and
wanted
me
to
get
the
slaves
away
that
way
so
he
would
have
to
cause
hard
feelins
by
freein
i
think
tabb
used
to
talk
a
lot
to
john
fee
fee
was
a
man
who
lived
in
kentucky
but
lord
how
that
man
hated
slavery
he
used
to
always
tell
us
we
never
let
our
owners
see
us
listenin
to
him
though
that
god
did
intend
for
some
men
to
be
free
and
some
men
be
in
slavery
he
used
to
talk
to
the
owners
too
when
they
would
listen
to
him
but
mostly
they
hated
the
sight
of
john
fee
in
the
night
though
he
was
a
different
man
for
every
slave
who
came
through
his
place
going
across
the
river
he
had
a
good
word
something
to
eat
and
some
kind
of
rags
too
if
it
was
cold
he
always
knew
just
what
to
tell
you
to
do
if
anything
went
wrong
and
sometimes
i
think
he
kept
slaves
there
on
his
place
they
could
be
rowed
across
the
river
helped
us
a
lot
i
almost
ran
the
business
in
the
ground
after
i
had
been
carrying
the
slaves
across
for
nearly
four
years
it
was
in
and
one
night
i
carried
across
about
twelve
on
the
same
night
somebody
must
have
seen
us
because
they
set
out
after
me
as
soon
as
i
stepped
out
of
the
boat
back
on
the
kentucky
side
from
that
time
on
they
were
after
me
sometimes
they
would
almost
catch
me
i
had
to
run
away
from
plantation
and
live
in
the
fields
and
in
the
woods
i
did
know
what
a
bed
was
from
one
week
to
another
i
would
sleep
in
a
cornfield
tonight
up
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
tomorrow
night
and
buried
in
a
haypile
the
next
night
the
river
where
i
had
carried
so
many
across
myself
was
no
good
to
me
it
was
watched
too
close
finally
i
saw
that
i
could
never
do
any
more
good
in
mason
county
so
i
decided
to
take
my
freedom
too
i
had
a
wife
by
this
time
and
one
night
we
quietly
slipped
across
and
headed
for
rankin
bell
and
light
it
looked
like
we
had
to
go
almost
to
china
to
get
across
that
river
i
could
hear
the
bell
and
see
the
light
on
rankin
place
but
the
harder
i
rowed
the
farther
away
it
got
and
i
knew
if
i
make
it
i
get
killed
but
finally
i
pulled
up
by
the
lighthouse
and
went
on
to
my
freedom
just
a
few
months
before
all
of
the
slaves
got
their
i
did
stay
in
ripley
though
i
was
taking
no
chances
i
went
on
to
detroit
and
still
live
there
with
most
of
children
and
grandchildren
the
bigger
ones
do
care
so
much
about
hearin
it
now
but
the
little
ones
never
get
tired
of
hearin
how
their
grandpa
brought
emancipation
to
loads
of
slaves
he
could
touch
and
feel
but
never
could

harriett
gresham
can
recall
quite
clearly
the
major
events
of
her
life
as
a
slave
also
the
civil
war
as
it
affected
the
slaves
of
charleston
and
barnwell
south
carolina

of
a
group
of

with
the

quaint
expressions

this
record
was
given
harriett
by
harriett
bellinger
her
mistress
each
slave
received
a
similar
one
on
being
freed
as
a
child
harriett
played
about
the
premises
of
the
bellinger
estate
leading
a
very
carefree
life
as
did
all
the
slave
children
belonging
to
edmond
bellinger
when
she
was
about
twelve
years
old
she
was
given
small
tasks
to
do
such
as
knitting
a
pair
of
stockings
or
dusting
the
furniture
and
ample
time
was
given
for
each
of
these
assignments
this
was
a
very
large
plantation
and
there
was
always
something
for
the
score
of
slaves
to
do
there
were
the
wide
acres
of
cotton
that
must
be
planted
hoed
and
gathered
by
hand
a
special
batch
of
slave
women
did
the
spinning
and
weaving
while
those
who
had
been
taught
to
sew
made
most
of
the
clothing
worn
by
slaves
at
that
time
other
products
grown
here
were
rice
corn
sugarcane
fruits
and
vegetables
much
of
the
food
grown
on
the
plantation
was
reserved
to
feed
the
slaves
while
they
must
work
hard
to
complete
their
tasks
in
a
given
time
no
one
was
allowed
to
go
hungry
or
forced
to
work
if
the
least
ill
very
little
had
to
be
bought
here
candles
ware
made
in
the
kitchen
of
the
big
house
usually
by
the
cook
who
was
helped
by
other
slaves
these
were
made
of
beeswax
gathered
on
the
plantation
shoes
were
made
of
tanned
dried
leather
and
with
brass
caps
the
large
herds
of
cattle
hogs
and
poultry
furnished
sufficient
meat
syrup
and
sugar
were
made
from
the
cane
that
was
carried
to
a
neighboring
mill
harriett
remembers
her
master
as
being
exceptionally
kind
but
very
severe
when
his
patience
was
tried
too
far
bellinger
was
dearly
loved
by
all
her
slaves
because
she
was
very
thoughtful
of
them
whenever
there
was
a
wedding
frolic
or
holiday
or
quilting
bee
she
was
sure
to
provide
some
extra
goody
and
so
dear
to
the
hearts
of
the
women
were
the
cast
off
clothes
she
so
often
bestowed
upon
them
on
these
occasions
the
slaves
were
free
to
invite
those
from
the
neighboring
plantations
to
join
in
their
social
gatherings
a
negro
preacher
delivered
sermons
on
the
plantation
services
being
held
in
the
church
used
by
whites
after
their
services
on
sunday
the
preacher
must
always
act
as
a
peacemaker
and
mouthpiece
for
the
master
so
they
were
told
to
be
subservient
to
their
masters
in
order
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
god
but
the
slaves
held
secret
meetings
and
had
praying
grounds
where
they
met
a
few
at
a
time
to
pray
for
better
things
harriett
remembers
little
about
the
selling
of
slaves
because
this
was
never
done
on
the
bellinger
plantation
all
slaves
were
considered
a
part
of
the
estate
and
to
sell
one
meant
that
it
was
no
longer
intact
there
were
rumors
of
the
war
but
the
slaves
on
the
bellinger
place
did
not
grasp
the
import
of
the
war
until
their
master
went
to
fight
on
the
side
of
the
rebel
army
many
of
them
gathered
about
their
mistress
and
wept
as
he
left
the
home
to
which
he
would
never
return
soon
after
that
it
was
whispered
among
the
slaves
that
they
would
be
free
but
no
one
ran
away
after
living
in
plenty
all
their
lives
they
were
forced
to
do
without
coffee
sugar
salt
and
beef
everything
available
was
bundled
off
to
the
army
by
bellinger
who
shared
the
popular
belief
that
the
soldiers
must
have
the
best
in
the
way
of
food
and
clothing
harriett
still
remembers
very
clearly
the
storming
of
fort
sumpter
the
whole
countryside
was
thrown
into
confusion
and
many
slaves
were
mad
with
fear
there
were
few
men
left
to
establish
order
and
many
women
loaded
their
slaves
into
wagons
and
gathered
such
belongings
as
they
could
and
fled
bellinger
was
one
of
those
who
held
their
ground
when
the
union
soldiers
visited
her
plantation
they
found
the
plantation
in
perfect
order
the
slaves
going
about
their
tasks
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
happened
it
was
necessary
to
summon
them
from
the
fields
to
give
them
the
message
of
their
freedom
harriett
recalls
that
her
mistress
was
very
frightened
but
walked
upright
and
held
a
trembling
lip
between
her
teeth
as
they
waited
for
her
to
sound
for
the
last
time
the
horn
that
had
summoned
several
generations
of
human
chattel
to
and
from
work
some
left
the
plantation
others
remained
to
harvest
the
crops
one
and
all
they
remembered
to
thank
god
for
their
freedom
they
immediately
began
to
hold
meetings
singing
soul
stirring
spirituals
harriett
recalls
one
of
these
songs
it
is
as
follows
ye
marster

harriett
parents
remained
with
the
widowed
woman
for
a
while
had
they
not
remained
she
might
not
have
met
gaylord
jeannette
the
knight
in
blue
who
later
became
her
husband
he
was
a
member
of
company
i
regiment
she
is
still
a
bit
breathless
when
she
relates
the
details
of
the
military
wedding
that
followed
a
whirlwind
courtship
which
had
its
beginning
on
the
citadel
green
where
the
soldiers
stationed
there
held
their
dress
parade
after
these
parades
there
was
dancing
by
the
soldiers
and
belles
who
had
bedecked
themselves
in
their
sunday
best
and
come
out
to
be
wooed
by
a
soldier
in
blue
music
was
furnished
by
the
military
band
which
offered
many
patriotic
numbers
that
awakened
in
the
newly
freed
negroes
that
had
long
been
dead
patriotism
harriett
recalls
snatches
of
one
of
these
songs
to
which
she
danced
when
she
was
years
of
age
it
is
as
follows
do
you
see
the
lightning
flashing
in
the
cane
brakes
looks
like
we
gon
na
have
a
storm
although
you
mistaken
its
the
yankee
soldiers
going
to
fight
for
uncle
sam
old
master
was
a
colonel
in

army
just
before
he
had
to
run
away
look
out
the
battle

the
darkies
gon

land
harriett
believes
the
two
officers
who
tendered
congratulations
shortly
after
her
marriage
to
have
been
generals
gates
and
beecher
this
was
an
added
thrill
to
her
as
she
lived
a
rather
secluded
life
harriett
gresham
can
tell
very
little
about
the
superstitions
of
her
people
during
slavery
but
knew
them
to
be
very
reverent
of
various
signs
and
omens
in
one
she
places
much
credence
herself
prior
to
the
civil
war
there
were
hordes
of
ants
and
everyone
said
this
was
an
omen
of
war
and
there
was
a
war
she
was
married
when
schools
were
set
up
for
negroes
but
had
no
time
for
school
her
master
was
adamant
on
one
point
and
that
was
the
danger
of
teaching
a
slave
to
read
and
write
so
harriett
received
little
book
learning
harriett
gresham
is
the
mother
of
several
children
grandchildren
and
great
grandchildren
many
of
them
are

she
lives
at

with

her
second

she
sits
on

her
by

who
is
also

she
embroiders
crochets

she
likes
to
show
her
handiwork
to
passersby
who
will
find
themselves
listening
to
some
of
her
reminiscences
if
they
linger
long
enough
to
engage
her
in
conversation
for
she
loves
to
talk
of
the
past
she
still

with
one
of

of
her

now
an
old

the

the
parents
of

the
halls
who
were
born
before
slavery
worked
on
the
large
plantation
of
lenton
which
was
devoted
primarily
to
the
growing
of
cotton
and
corn
and
secondarily
to
the
growing
of
tobacco
and
pumpkins
lenton
was
very
good
to
his
slaves
and
never
whipped
them
unless
it
was
absolutely
necessary
which
was
seldom
he
provided
them
with
plenty
of
food
and
clothing
and
always
saw
to
it
that
their
cabins
were
liveable
he
was
careful
however
to
see
that
they
received
no
educational
training
but
did
not
interfere
with
their
religious
quest
the
slaves
were
permitted
to
attend
church
with
their
masters
to
hear
the
white
preacher
and
occasionally
the
master
supposedly
to
the
slaves
would
have
an
itinerant
colored
minister
preach
to
the
slaves
instructing
them
to
obey
their
master
and
mistress
at
all
times
although
freedom
came
to
the
slaves
in
january
master
lenton
kept
them
until
may
in
order
to
help
him
with
his
crops
when
actual
freedom
was
granted
to
the

only
a

shepherd
mitchell
was
a
wagoner
who
hauled
whiskey
from
newport
news
virginia
for
his
owner
wilkerson
was
very
cruel
and
held
them
in
constant
fear
of
him
he
would
not
permit
them
to
hold
religious
meetings
or
any
other
kinds
of
meetings
but
they
frequently
met
in
secret
to
conduct
religious
services
when
they
were
caught
the
instigators
known
or
suspected
were
severely
flogged
charlotte
recalls
how
her
oldest
brother
was
whipped
to
death
for
taking
part
in
one
of
the
religious
ceremonies
this
cruel
act
halted
the
secret
religious
services
wilkerson
found
it
very
profitable
to
raise
and
sell
slaves
he
selected
the
strongest
and
best
male
and
female
slaves
and
mated
them
exclusively
for
breeding
the
huskiest
babies
were
given
the
best
of
attention
in
order
that
they
might
grow
into
sturdy
youths
for
it
was
those
who
brought
the
highest
prices
at
the
slave
markets
sometimes
the
master
himself
had
sexual
relations
with
his
female
slaves
for
the
products
of
miscegenation
were
very
remunerative
these
offsprings
were
in
demand
as
house
servants
after
slavery
the
mitchells
began
to
separate
a
few
of
the
children
remained
with
their
parents
and
eked
out
their
living
from
the
soil
during
this
period
charlotte
began
to
attract
attention
with
her
herb
cures
doctors
sought
her
out
when
they
were
stumped
by
difficult
cases
she
came
to
live
oak
to
care
for
an
old
colored
woman
and
upon
whose
death
she
was
given
the

nearly
eighty
years
ago
sarah
is
the
daughter
of
harriet
elmore
and
william
donaldson
her
white
owner
donaldson
was
a
very
cruel
man
and
frequently
beat
sarah
mother
because
she
would
not
have
sexual
relations
with
the
overseer
a
colored
man
by
the
name
of
randall
sarah
relates
that
the
slaves
did
not
marry
but
were
forced
in
many
cases
against
their
will
to
live
together
as
man
and
wife
it
was
not
until
after
slavery
that
they
learned
about
the
holy
bonds
of
matrimony
and
many
of
them
actually
married
cotton
corn
and
rice
were
the
chief
products
grown
on
the
donaldson
plantation
okra
also
was
grown
and
from
this
product
coffee
was
made
the
slaves
arose
with
the
sun
to
begin
their
tasks
in
the
fields
and
worked
until
dusk
they
were
beaten
by
the
overseer
if
they
dared
to
rest
themselves
no
kind
of
punishment
was
too
cruel
or
severe
to
be
inflicted
upon
these
souls
in
bondage
frequently
the
thighs
of
the
male
slaves
were
gashed
with
a
saw
and
salt
put
in
the
wound
as
a
means
of
punishment
for
some
misdemeanor
the
female
slaves
often
had
their
hair
cut
off
especially
those
who
had
long
beautiful
hair
if
a
female
slave
was
pregnant
and
had
to
be
punished
she
was
whipped
about
the
shoulders
not
so
much
in
pity
as
for
the
protection
of
the
unborn
child
donaldson
wife
committed
suicide
because
of
the
cruelty
not
only
to
the
slaves
but
to
her
as
well
the
slaves
were
not
permitted
to
hold
any
sort
of
meeting
not
even
to
worship
god
their
work
consumed
so
much
of
their
time
that
they
had
little
opportunity
to
congregate
they
had
to
wash
their
clothes
on
sunday
the
only
day
which
they
could
call
their
own
on
sunday
afternoon
some
of
the
slaves
were
sent
for
to
entertain
the
family
and
its
guests
sarah
remembers
the
coming
of
the
yankees
and
the
destruction
wrought
by
their
appearance
the
soldiers
stripped
the
plantation
owners
of
their
meats
vegetables
poultry
and
the
like
many
plantation
owners
took
their
own
lives
in
desperation
donaldson
kept
his
slaves
several
months
after
liberation
and
defied
them
to
mention
freedom
to
him
when
he
did
give
them
freedom
they
lost
no
time
in
leaving
his
plantation
which
held
for
them
only
unpleasant
memories

rebecca
hooks
age
years
is
one
of
the
few
among
the
ranks
of
who
can
give
a
clear
picture
of
life
befo
de
wah
she
was
born
in
jones
county
georgia
of
martha
and
pleasant
lowe
who
were
slaves
of
william
lowe
the
mother
was
the
mulatto
offspring
of
william
lowe
and
a
slave
woman
who
was
half
cherokee
the
father
was
also
a
mulatto
purchased
from
a
nearby
plantation
because
of
this
blood
mixture
rebecca
parents
were
known
as
house
niggers
and
lived
on
quarters
located
in
the
rear
of
the
big
house
a
house
nigger
was
a
servant
whose
duties
consisted
of
chores
around
the
big
house
such
as
butler
maid
cook
stableman
gardner
and
personal
attendant
to
the
man
who
owned
him
these
slaves
were
often
held
in
high
esteem
by
their
masters
and
of
course
fared
much
better
than
the
other
slaves
on
the
plantation
quite
often
they
were
mulattoes
as
in
the
case
of
rebecca
parents
there
seemed
to
be
a
general
belief
among
slave
owners
that
mulattoes
could
not
stand
as
much
laborious
work
as
pure
blooded
negro
slaves
this
accounts
probably
for
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
now
alive
are
mulattoes
the
lowes
were
originally
of
virginia
and
did
not
own
as
much
property
in
georgia
as
they
had
in
virginia
rebecca
estimates
the
number
of
slaves
on
this
plantation
as
numbering
no
more
than
they
were
treated
kindly
and
cruelly
by
turns
according
to
the
whims
of
a
master
and
mistress
who
were
none
too
stable
in
their
dispositions
there
was
no
driver
or
overseer
on
this
plantation
as
old
tom
was
devil
enough
himself
when
he
wanted
to
be
observes
rebecca
while
she
never
felt
the
full
force
of
his
cruelties
she
often
felt
sorry
for
the
other
slaves
who
were
given
a
task
too
heavy
to
be
completed
in
the
given
time
this
deliberately
so
that
the
master
might
have
some
excuse
to
vent
his
pentup
feelings
punishment
was
always
in
the
form
of
a
severe
whipping
or
revocation
of
a
slave
privilege
such
as
visiting
other
plantations
etc
the
lowes
were
not
wealthy
and
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
raise
and
manufacture
as
many
things
on
the
plantation
as
possible
slaves
toiled
from
early
morning
until
night
in
the
corn
cotton
sugar
cane
and
tobacco
fields
others
tended
the
large
herds
of
cattle
from
which
milk
butter
meat
and
leather
was
produced
the
leather
was
tanned
and
made
into
crude
shoes
for
the
slaves
for
the
short
winter
months
no
one
wore
shoes
except
during
cold
weather
and
on
sundays
fruit
orchards
and
vegetables
were
also
grown
but
not
given
as
much
attention
as
the
cotton
and
corn
as
these
were
the
main
money
crops
as
a
child
rebecca
learned
to
ape
the
ways
of
her
mistress
at
first
this
was
considered
very
amusing
whenever
she
had
not
knitted
her
required
number
of
socks
during
the
week
she
simply
informed
them
that
she
had
not
done
it
because
she
had
not
wanted
to
besides
she
was
not
a
nigger
this
stubbornness
accompanied
by
hysterical
tantrums
continued
to
cause
rebecca
to
receive
many
stiff
punishments
that
might
have
been
avoided
her
master
had
given
orders
that
no
one
was
ever
to
whip
her
so
devious
methods
were
employed
to
punish
her
such
as
marching
her
down
the
road
with
hands
tied
behind
her
back
or
locking
her
in
a
dark
room
for
several
hours
with
only
bread
and
water
rebecca
resembled
very
much
a
daughter
of
william
lowe
the
girl
was
really
her
aunt
and
very
conscious
of
the
resemblance
both
had
brown
eyes
and
long
dark
hair
they
were
about
the
same
height
and
the
clothes
of
the
young
mistress
fitted
rebecca
like
a
glove
to
offset
this
likeness
rebecca
hair
was
always
cut
very
short
finally
rebecca
rebelled
at
having
her
hair
all
cut
off
and
blankly
refused
to
submit
to
the
treatment
any
longer
after
this
happening
the
girls
formed
a
dislike
for
each
other
and
rebecca
was
guilty
of
doing
every
mean
act
of
which
she
was
capable
to
torment
the
white
girl
rebecca
mother
aided
and
abetted
her
in
this
often
telling
her
things
to
do
rebecca
did
not
fear
the
form
of
punishment
administered
her
and
she
had
the
cunning
to
keep
on
the
good
side
of
the
master
who
had
a
fondness
for
her
because
she
was
so
much
like
the
lowes
the
mistress
demand
that
she
be
sold
or
beaten
was
always
turned
aside
with
dear
you
know
the
child
ca
help
it
its
that
cursed
cherokee
blood
in
her
there
seemed
to
be
no
very
strong
opposition
to
a
slave
learning
to
read
and
write
on
the
plantation
so
rebecca
learned
along
with
the
white
children
her
father
purchased
books
for
her
with
money
he
was
allowed
to
earn
from
the
sale
of
corn
whiskey
which
he
made
or
from
work
done
on
some
other
plantation
during
his
time
off
he
was
not
permitted
to
buy
his
freedom
however
on
sundays
rebecca
attended
church
along
with
the
other
slaves
services
were
held
in
the
white
churches
after
their
services
were
over
they
were
taught
to
obey
their
masters
and
work
hard
and
that
they
should
be
very
thankful
for
the
institution
of
slavery
which
brought
them
from
darkest
africa
on
the
plantation
the
doctor
was
not
nearly
as
popular
as
the
granny
or
midwife
who
brewed
medicines
for
every
ailment
each
plantation
had
its
own
granny
who
also
served
the
mistress
during
confinement
some
of
her
remedies
follows
for
colds
horehound
tea
pinetop
tea
lightwood
drippings
on
sugar
for
fever
a
tea
made
of
pomegranate
seeds
and
crushed
mint
for
whooping
cough
a
tea
made
of
sheep
shandy
manure
catnip
tea
for
spasms
garlic
burning
a
garment
next
to
the
skin
of
the
patient
having
the
fit
shortly
before
the
war
rebecca
was
married
to
solomon
her
husband
this
ceremony
consisted
of
simply
jumping
over
a
broom
and
having
some
one
read
a
few
words
from
a
book
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
the
bible
after
the
war
many
couples
were
remarried
because
of
this
irregularity
rebecca
had
learned
of
the
war
long
before
it
ended
and
knew
its
import
she
had
confided
this
information
to
other
slaves
who
could
read
and
write
she
read
the
small
newspaper
that
her
master
received
at
irregular
intervals
the
two
sons
of
william
lowe
had
gone
to
fight
with
the
confederate
soldiers
one
never
returned
and
everywhere
was
felt
the
tension
caused
by
wild
speculation
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
war
certain
commodities
were
very
scarce
rebecca
remembers
drinking
coffee
made
of
okra
seed
that
had
been
dried
and
parched
there
was
no
silk
except
that
secured
by
running
the
blockade
and
this
was
very
expensive
the
smokehouse
floors
were
carefully
scraped
for
any
morsel
of
salt
that
might
be
gotten
salt
had
to
be
evaporated
from
sea
water
and
this
was
a
slow
process
there
were
no
disorders
in
that
section
as
far
as
rebecca
remembers
but
she
thinks
that
the
slaves
were
kept
on
the
lowe
plantation
a
long
time
after
they
had
been
freed
it
was
only
when
rumors
came
that
union
soldiers
were
patrolling
the
countryside
for
such
offenders
that
they
were
hastily
told
of
their
freedom
their
former
master
predicted
that
they
would
fare
much
worse
as
freemen
and
so
many
of
them
were
afraid
to
venture
into
the
world
for
themselves
remaining
in
virtual
slavery
for
many
years
afterward
rebecca
and
her
husband
were
among
those
who
left
the
plantation
they
on
various
plantations
until
they
came
to
florida
which
is
more
than
fifty
years
ago
rebecca
husband
died
several
years
ago
and
she
now
lives
with
two
daughters
who
are

jackson
former

and
minister
of
the
gospel
living
at
third
street
cheerfully
related
the
story
of
his
life
born
in
a
shanty
in
madison
september
of
a
large
family
he
moved
to
jacksonville
at
the
age
of
three
with
the
master
and
his
mother
very
devoted
to
his
mother
he
would
follow
her
into
the
cotton
field
as
she
picked
or
hoed
cotton
urged
by
the
thrashing
of
the
lash
his
master
a
prominent
political
figure
of
that
time
was
very
kind
to
his
slaves
but
would
not
permit
them
to
read
and
write
relating
an
incident
after
having
learned
to
read
and
write
one
day
as
he
was
reading
a
newspaper
the
master
walked
upon
him
unexpectingly
and
demanded
to
know
what
he
was
doing
with
a
newspaper
he
immediately
turned
the
paper
upside
down
and
declared
confederates
done
won
the
war
the
master
laughed
and
walked
away
without
punishing
him
it
la
interesting
to
know
that
slaves
on
this
plantation
were
not
allowed
to
sing
when
they
were
at
work
but
with
all
the
vigilance
of
the
overseers
nothing
could
stop
those
silent
songs
of
labor
and
prayers
for
freedom
on
sundays
the
boys
on
the
plantation
would
play
home
ball
and
shoot
marbles
until
church
time
after
church
a
hearty
meal
consisting
of
rice
and
salt
picked
pork
was
the
usual
sunday
fare
cooked
in
large
iron
pots
hung
over
indoor
hearths
sometimes
coffee
made
out
of
parched
corn
meal
was
added
as
an
extra
treat
he
remembers
the
start
of
the
civil
war
with
the
laying
of
the
atlantic
cable
by
the
great
eastern
being
nineteen
years
of
age
at
the
time
hearing
threats
of
the
war
which
was
about
to
begin
he
ran
away
with
his
brother
to
lake
city
many
times
hiding
in
trees
and
groves
from
the
posse
that
was
looking
for
him
at
night
he
would
cover
up
his
face
and
body
with
spanish
moss
to
sleep
one
night
he
hid
in
a
tree
near
a
creek
himself
in
the
morning
a
group
of
white
women
fishing
near
the
creek
saw
him
and
ran
to
tell
the
men
fortunately
however
he
escaped
after
four
days
of
wearied
travelling
being
guided
by
the
north
star
and
the
indian
instinct
inherited
from
his
indian
grandmother
he
finally
reached
lake
city
later
reporting
to
general
scott
he
was
informed
that
he
was
to
act
as
orderly
until
further
ordered
on
saturday
morning
february
general
scott
called
him
to
his
tent
and
said
squire
i
have
just
had
you
appraised
for
and
you
are
to
report
to
guist
in
alachua
county
for
service
immediately
that
very
night
he
ran
away
to
wellborn
where
the
federals
were
camping
there
in
a
horse
stable
were
wounded
colored
soldiers
stretched
out
on
the
filthy
ground
the
sight
of
these
wounded
men
and
the
feeble
medical
attention
given
them
by
the
federals
was
so
repulsive
to
him
that
he
decided
that
he
did
want
to
join
the
federal
army
in
the
silent
hours
of
the
evening
he
stole
away
to
tallahassee
throughly
convinced
that
war
was
the
place
for
him
while
in
the
horse
shed
hospital
a
white
soldier
asked
one
of
the
wounded
colored
soldiers
to
what
regiment
he
belonged
the
negro
replied
regiment
massachusetts
at
that
time
the
only
railroad
was
between
lake
city
and
tallahassee
which
he
had
worked
on
for
awhile
at
the
close
of
the
war
he
returned
to
jacksonville
to
begin
work
as
a
bricklayer
during
this
period
negro
skilled
help
was
very
much
in
demand
the
first
time
he
saw
ice
was
in
when
a
ship
brought
some
into
this
port
moody
a
white
man
opened
an
icehouse
at
the
foot
of
julia
street
this
was
the
only
icehouse
in
the
city
at
that
time
on
sundays
he
would
attend
church
one
day
he
thought
he
heard
the
call
of
god
beseeching
him
to
preach
he
began
to
preach
in
and
was
ordained
an
elder
in
some
of
the
interesting
facts
obtained
from
this
slave
of
the
fourth
generation
were
salt
was
obtained
by
evaporating
sea
water
there
were
no
regular

was
done
by

in
the
fireplaces
an
open
well
was
used
to
obtain
water
flour
was
sold
at
a
barrell
was
used
for
money
the
first
buggy
was
called
rockaways
due
to
the
elasticity
of
the
rev
jackson
saw
his
first
buggy
as
described
in
during
the
civil
war
cloth
as
well
as
all
other
commodities
were
very
high
slaves
were
required
to
weave
the
cloth
the
women
would
delight
in
dancing
as
they
marched
to
and
fro
in
weaving
the
cloth
by
hand
this
was
one
kind
of
work
the
slaves
enjoyed
doing
even
cotton
seeds
was
picked
by
hand
hulling
the
seeds
out
with
the
fingers
there
was
no
way
of
ginning
it
by
machine
at
that
time
rev
jackson
vividly
recalls
the
being
used
around
bales
of
the
finer
cotton
known
as
short
cotton
during
this
same
period
he
made
all
of
the
shoes
he
wore
by
hand
from
cow
hides
the
women
slaves
at
that
time
wore
grass
shirts
woven
very
closely
with
hoops
around
on
the
inside
to
keep
from
contacting
the
body
gleefully
he
told
of
the
saturday
night
baths
in
big
wooden
washtubs
with
cut
out
holes
for
the
fingers
during
his
boyhood

years
after

were

very
little
moss
was
used
for

chicken

and
goose
feathers
were
the
principal
constituents
during
his
boyhood
soot
mixed
with
water
was
the
best
medicine
one
could
use
for
the
stomach
ache
at
that
time
rev

married
in

has
seven
sons
and

owns
his
own

this
handsome
bronze
piece
of

ended
the

i
am
waiting
now
to
hear
the

once
was

says
that
the
treatment
during
the
time
of

was
very
tough
at
times
but
gathering
himself
up
he
said
no
storm
lasts
forever
and
i
had
the
faith
and
courage
of

carry
me

was
john
gay
owner
of
a
plantation
of
some
acres
and
over
slaves
and
a
heavy
drinker
the
prophet
calls
gay
father
and
becomes
very
vague
when
asked
if
this
title
is
a
blood
tie
or
a
name
of
which
he
is
generally
known
according
to
kemp
gay
was
one
of
the
meanest
plantation
owners
in
the
entire
section
and
frequently
voiced
his
pride
in
being
able
to
employ
the
cruelest
overseers
that
could
be
found
in
all
mississippi
among
these
were
such
men
as
turner
nels
thompson
billy
hole
andrew
winston
and
other
men
with
statewide
reputations
for
brutality
when
all
of
the
cruelties
of
one
overseer
had
been
felt
by
the
slaves
on
the
gay
plantation
and
another
meaner
man
reputation
was
heard
of
on
the
gay
plantation
the
master
would
delight
in
telling
his
slaves
that
if
they
did
not
behave
he
would
send
for
this
man
behaving
the
prophet
says
meant
living
on
less
food
than
one
should
have
mating
only
at
his
command
and
for
purposes
purely
of
breeding
more
and
stronger
slaves
on
his
plantation
for
sale
in
some
cases
with
women
subjecting
to
his
every
demand
if
they
would
escape
hanging
by
the
wrists
for
half
a
day
or
being
beaten
with
a
cowhide
whip
about
these
whippings
the
prophet
tells
many
a
tale
one
day
when
an
old
woman
was
plowing
in
the
field
an
overseer
came
by
and
reprimanded
her
for
being
so
slow
she
gave
him
some
back
talk
he
took
out
a
long
closely
woven
whip
and
lashed
her
severely
the
woman
became
sore
and
took
her
hoe
and
chopped
him
right
across
his
head
and
child
you
should
have
seen
how
she
chopped
this
man
to
a
bloody
death
prophet
kemp
will
tell
you
that
he
hates
to
tell
these
things
to
any
investigator
because
he
hates
for
people
to
know
just
how
mean
his
fahter
really
was
so
great
was
the
fear
in
which
gay
was
held
that
when
kemp
mother
arnette
young
complained
to
mrs
gay
that
her
husband
was
constantly
seeking
her
for
a
mistress
and
threatening
her
with
death
if
she
did
not
submit
even
mrs
gay
had
to
advise
the
slaves
to
do
as
gay
demanded
saying
my
husband
is
a
dirty
man
and
will
find
some
reason
to
kill
you
if
you
do
i
ca
do
a
thing
with
him
since
arnette
worked
at
the
big
house
there
was
no
alternative
and
it
was
believed
that
out
of
the
union
with
her
master
henry
was
born
a
young
slave
by
the
name
of
broxton
kemp
was
given
to
the
woman
as
husband
at
the
time
john
kemp
was
born
it
is
from
this
man
that
prophet
took
his
name
life
on
the
plantation
held
nothing
but
misery
for
the
slaves
of
john
gay
a
week
allowance
of
groceries
for
the
average
small
family
consisted
of
a
package
of
about
ten
pounds
containing
crudely
ground
meal
a
slab
of
bacon
called
and
from
a
pint
to
a
quart
of
syrup
made
from
sorghum
depending
upon
the
season
all
slaves
reported
for
work
a
in
the
morning
except
those
who
cared
for
the
overseer
who
began
their
work
an
hour
earlier
to
enable
the
overseer
to
be
present
at
the
morning
checkup
this
checkup
determined
which
slaves
were
late
or
who
had
committed
some
offense
late
on
the
day
before
or
during
the
night
these
were
singled
out
and
before
the
rest
of
the
slaves
began
their
work
they
were
treated
to
the
sight
of
these
delinquents
being
stripped
and
beaten
until
blood
flowed
women
were
no
exception
to
the
rule
the
possible
loss
of
his
slaves
upon
the
declaration
of
freedom
on
january
caused
gay
considerable
concern
his
mind
was
not
long
in
finding
a
solution
however
he
barred
all
visitors
from
his
plantation
and
insisted
that
his
overseers
see
to
the
carrying
out
of
this
detail
they
did
with
such
efficiency
that
it
was
not
until
may
when
the
government
finally
learned
of
the
condition
and
sent
a
marshall
to
the
plantation
that
freedom
came
to
gay
slaves
may
is
still
celebrated
in
this
section
of
mississippi
as
the
official
emancipation

relief
for
the
hundreds
of

at
last

may
have
gained

constant
reference
to
the

to
his

he
says
he
believes
on

one
religion

preaches
this
belief
constantly
he
claims
to
have
turned
his
back
on

do
not
do
as
the

says
in

this
belief
he
says
he
represents
the
true
primitive
baptist
church
but
does
not
have

palatka
florida
randall
lee
randall
lee
of
branson
street
palatka
florida
was
born
at
camden
south
carolina
about
years
ago
maybe
longer
he
was
the
son
of
robert
and
delhia
lee
who
during
slavery
were
robert
and
delhia
miller
taking
the
name
of
their
master
as
was
the
custom
his
master
was
doctor
miller
and
his
mistress
was
camilla
miller
he
does
not
know
his
master
given
name
as
no
other
name
was
ever
heard
around
the
plantation
except
doctor
miller
randall
was
a
small
boy
when
the
war
between
the
states
broke
out
but
judging
from
what
he
remembers
he
must
have
been
a
boy
around
six
or
seven
years
of
age
during
the
few
years
he
spent
in
slavery
randall
had
many
experiences
which
made
such
deep
impressions
upon
his
brain
that
the
memory
of
them
still
remains
clear
the
one
thing
that
causes
one
to
believe
that
he
must
have
been
around
seven
years
of
age
is
the
statement
that
he
was
not
old
enough
to
have
tasks
of
any
importance
placed
upon
him
yet
he
was
trusted
along
with
another
boy
about
his
own
age
to
carry
butter
from
the
plantation
dairy
two
miles
to
the
house
no
one
would
trust
a
child
younger
than
six
years
of
age
to
handle
butter
for
fear
of
it
being
dropped
into
the
dirt
he
must
have
at
least
reached
the
age
when
he
was
sent
two
miles
with
a
package
and
was
expected
to
deliver
the
package
intact
he
must
have
understood
the
necessity
of
not
playing
on
the
way
he
stated
that
he
knew
not
to
stop
on
the
journey
and
not
to
let
the
butter
get
dirty
randall
had
the
pleasure
of
catching
the
pig
for
his
father
for
doctor
miller
gave
each
of
his
best
negro
men
a
pig
to
raise
for
himself
and
family
he
was
allowed
to
build
a
pen
for
it
and
raise
and
fatten
it
for
killing
when
killing
time
came
he
was
given
time
to
butcher
it
and
grind
all
the
sausage
he
could
make
to
feed
his
family
by
that
method
it
helped
to
solve
the
feeding
problem
and
also
satisfied
the
slaves
it
was
more
like
so
many
families
living
around
a
big
house
with
a
boss
looking
over
them
for
they
were
allowed
a
privilege
that
very
few
masters
gave
their
slaves
on
the
miller
plantation
there
was
a
cotton
gin
doctor
miller
owned
the
gin
and
it
was
operated
by
his
slaves
he
grew
the
cotton
picked
it
ginned
it
and
wove
it
right
there
he
also
had
a
baler
and
made
the
bagging
to
bale
it
with
he
only
had
to
buy
the
iron
bands
that
held
the
bales
intact
doctor
miller
was
a
rich
man
and
had
a
far
reaching
sight
into
how
to
work
slaves
to
the
best
advantage
he
was
kind
to
them
and
knew
that
the
best
way
to
get
the
best
out
of
men
was
to
keep
them
well
and
happy
his
arrangement
was
very
much
the
general
way
in
that
he
allowed
the
young
men
and
women
to
work
in
the
fields
and
the
old
women
and
a
few
old
men
to
work
around
the
house
in
the
gin
and
at
the
loom
the
old
women
mostly
did
the
spinning
of
thread
and
weaving
of
cloth
although
in
some
instances
doctor
miller
found
a
man
who
was
better
adapted
to
weaving
than
any
of
his
women
slaves
everyone
kept
his
plantation
under
fence
and
men
who
were
old
but
strong
and
who
had
some
knowledge
of
carpentry
were
sent
out
to
keep
the
fence
in
repair
and
often
to
build
new
ones
the
fences
were
not
like
those
of
today
they
were
built
of
horizontal
rails
about
six
or
seven
feet
long
running
fashion
instead
of
having
straight
line
fences
and
posts
at
regular
points
they
did
not
use
posts
at
all
the
bottom
rails
rested
upon
the
ground
and
the
fashion
in
which
they
were
laid
gave
strength
to
the
fence
no
nails
were
used
to
hold
the
rails
in
place
if
stock
was
to
be
let
in
or
out
of
the
places
the
planks
were
unlocked
so
to
speak
and
the
stock
allowed
to
enter
after
which
they
were
laid
back
as
before
boys
and
girls
under
ten
years
of
age
were
never
sent
into
the
field
to
work
on
the
miller
plantation
but
were
required
to
mind
the
smaller
children
of
the
family
and
do
chores
around
the
big
house
for
the
mistress
and
her
children
such
work
as
mending
was
taught
the
children
and
tending
food
on
the
pots
was
alloted
others
with
inborn
ability
to
cook
they
were
treated
well
and
taught
and
later
was
used
as
dining
room
girls
and
nurses
randall
father
and
mother
were
considered
lucky
his
father
was
overseer
and
his
mother
was
a
waitress
doctor
miller
was
a
kind
and
considerate
owner
never
believed
in
punishing
slaves
unless
in
extreme
cases
no
overseer
white
or
colored
could
whip
his
slaves
without
first
bringing
the
slave
before
him
and
having
a
full
understanding
as
to
what
the
offense
was
if
it
warranted
whipping
them
it
had
to
be
given
in
his
presence
so
he
could
see
that
it
was
not
given
unmercifully
he
indeed
was
a
doctor
and
practised
his
profession
in
the
keeping
of
his
slaves
from
bodily
harm
as
well
as
keeping
them
well
he
gave
them
medicine
when
they
did
not
feel
well
and
saw
to
it
that
they
took
needed
rest
if
they
were
sick
and
tired
now
robert
lee
randall
father
was
brought
from
virginia
and
sold
to
doctor
miller
when
he
was
a
young
man
the
one
who
sold
him
told
doctor
miller
here
a
nigger
who
wont
take
a
whipping
he
knows
his
work
and
will
do
it
and
all
you
will
need
to
do
is
tell
him
what
you
want
and
its
as
good
as
done
robert
lee
never
varied
from
the
recommendation
his
former
master
gave
when
he
sold
him
the
old
tale
of
corn
bread
baked
on
the
hearth
covered
with
ashes
and
sweet
potatoes
cooked
in
like
manner
are
vivid
memories
upon
the
mind
of
randall
syrup
water
and
plenty
of
sweet
and
butter
milk
rice
and
crackling
bread
are
other
foods
which
were
plentiful
around
the
cabin
of
randall
parents
cows
were
numerous
and
the
family
of
doctor
miller
did
not
need
much
for
their
consumption
while
they
sold
milk
to
neighboring
plantations
the
negroes
were
not
denied
the
amount
necessary
to
keep
all
strong
and
healthy
none
of
the
children
on
the
plantation
were
thin
and
scrawny
nor
did
they
ever
complain
of
being
hungry
the
tanning
yard
was
not
far
from
the
house
doctor
miller
his
own
butcher
shop
was
nearby
he
had
his
cows
butchered
at
intervals
and
when
one
died
of
unnatural
causes
it
was
skinned
and
the
hide
tanned
on
the
place
randall
as
a
child
delighted
in
stopping
around
the
tanning
yard
and
watching
the
men
salt
the
hide
they
after
salting
it
dug
holes
and
buried
it
for
a
number
of
days
after
the
salting
process
was
finished
it
was
treated
with
a
solution
of
water
and
oak
bark
when
the
oak
bark
solution
had
done
its
work
it
was
ready
for
use
shoes
made
of
leather
were
not
dyed
at
that
time
but
the
natural
color
of
the
finished
hide
was
thought
very
beautiful
and
those
who
were
lucky
enough
to
possess
a
pair
were
glad
to
get
them
in
their
natural
color
to
dye
shoes
various
colors
is
a
new
thing
when
the
number
of
years
leather
has
been
dyed
is
compared
with
the
hundreds
of
years
people
knew
nothing
about
it
especially
american
people
randall
paternal
grandparents
were
also
owned
by
doctor
miller
and
were
not
sold
after
he
bought
them
levi
lee
was
his
grandfather
name
he
was
a
fine
worker
in
the
field
but
was
taken
out
of
it
to
be
taught
the
trade
the
master
placed
him
under
a
white
shoemaker
who
taught
him
all
the
fine
points
if
there
were
any
he
knew
about
the
trade
miller
had
an
eye
for
business
who
could
make
shoes
was
a
great
saving
to
him
levi
made
all
the
shoes
and
boots
the
master
mistress
and
the
miller
family
wore
besides
he
made
shoes
for
the
slaves
who
wore
them
not
all
slaves
owned
a
pair
of
shoes
boys
and
girls
under
eighteen
went
except
in
winter
doctor
miller
had
compassion
for
them
and
did
not
allow
them
to
suffer
from
the
cold
by
going
in
winter
another
good
thing
to
be
remembered
was
the
large
number
of
chickens
ducks
and
geese
which
the
slaves
raised
for
the
doctor
every
slave
family
could
rest
his
tired
body
upon
a
feather
bed
for
it
was
allowed
him
after
the
members
of
the
master
family
were
supplied
moss
mattresses
also
were
used
under
the
feather
beds
and
slaves
did
not
need
to
have
as
thick
a
feather
bed
on
that
account
they
were
comfortable
though
and
randall
remembers
how
he
and
the
other
children
used
to
fall
down
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
and
become
hidden
from
view
so
soft
was
the
feather
mattress
it
was
especially
good
to
get
in
bed
in
winter
but
not
so
pleasant
to
get
up
unless
had
made
the
fire
early
enough
for
the
large
cabin
to
get
warm
the
children
called
their
own
parents
and
in
slavery
time
randall
remembers
how
after
a
in
the
old
wooden
tub
which
by
the
way
was
simply
a
barrel
cut
in
half
and
holes
cut
in
the
two
sides
for
fingers
to
catch
a
hold
he
would
sit
a
few
minutes
with
his
feet
held
to
the
fire
so
they
could
dry
he
also
said
his
would
rub
grease
under
the
soles
of
his
feet
to
keep
him
from
taking
cold
it
seemed
to
the
child
that
he
had
just
gone
to
bed
when
the
old
tallow
candle
was
lighted
and
his
arose
and
fell
upon
his
knees
and
prayed
aloud
for
god
blessings
and
thanked
him
for
another
day
the
field
hands
were
to
be
in
the
field
by
five
and
it
meant
to
rise
before
day
summer
and
winter
not
so
bad
in
summer
for
it
was
soon
day
but
in
winter
the
weather
was
cold
and
darkness
was
longer
passing
away
when
daylight
came
field
hands
had
been
working
an
hour
or
more
robert
lee
randall
father
was
an
overseer
and
it
meant
for
him
to
be
up
and
out
with
the
rest
of
the
men
so
he
could
see
if
things
were
going
allright
the
randall
children
were
not
forced
up
early
because
they
did
not
eat
breakfast
with
their
their
mother
was
girl
in
her
mistress
house
so
fed
the
children
right
from
the
miller
table
there
was
no
objection
offered
to
this
doctor
miller
was
kind
but
he
did
not
want
his
slaves
enlightened
too
much
therefore
he
did
not
allow
much
preaching
in
the
church
they
could
have
prayer
meeting
all
they
wanted
to
but
instructions
from
the
bible
were
thought
dangerous
for
the
slaves
he
did
not
wish
them
to
become
too
wise
and
get
it
into
their
heads
to
ran
away
and
get
free
there
was
talk
about
freedom
and
doctor
miller
knew
it
would
be
only
a
matter
of
time
when
he
would
loose
all
his
slaves
he
said
to
mother
one
day
delhia
you
soon
be
as
free
as
i
am
she
said
nuf
massy
and
he
answered
you
sure
will
nothing
more
was
said
to
any
of
the
slaves
until
sherman
army
came
through
notifying
the
slaves
they
were
free
the
presence
of
the
soldiers
caused
such
a
comotion
around
the
plantation
that
randall
mind
was
indelibly
impressed
with
their
doings
the
northern
soldiers
took
all
the
food
they
could
get
their
hands
on
and
took
possession
of
the
cattle
and
horses
and
mules
levi
the
brother
of
randall
and
who
was
named
after
his
paternal
grandfather
was
put
on
a
mule
and
the
mule
loaded
with
provisions
and
sent
two
miles
to
the
soldier
camp
levi
liked
that
for
beside
being
well
treated
he
received
several
pieces
of
money
the
federal
soldiers
played
with
him
and
gave
him
all
the
food
he
wanted
although
the
miller
slaves
and
their
children
were
fed
and
there
was
no
reason
for
the
child
to
be
hungry
levi
lee
the
grandfather
of
young
levi
and
randall
had
a
dream
while
the
soldiers
were
encamped
round
about
the
place
he
dreamed
that
a
pot
of
money
was
buried
in
a
certain
place
the
person
who
showed
it
to
him
told
him
to
go
dig
for
it
on
the
first
rainy
night
he
kept
the
dream
a
secret
and
on
the
first
rainy
night
he
went
dug
and
found
the
pot
of
money
right
where
his
dream
had
told
him
it
would
be
he
took
the
pot
of
money
to
his
cabin
and
told
no
one
anything
about
it
he
hid
it
as
securely
as
possible
but
when
the
soldiers
were
searching
for
gold
and
silver
money
they
did
not
leave
the
negro
cabin
out
of
the
search
when
they
found
the
money
they
thought
levi
master
had
given
him
the
money
to
hide
as
they
took
it
from
him
levi
mourned
a
long
time
about
the
loss
of
his
money
and
often
told
his
grandchildren
that
he
would
have
been
well
fixed
when
freedom
came
if
he
had
not
been
robbed
of
his
money
paddyroles
as
the
men
were
called
who
were
sent
by
the
rebels
to
watch
the
slaves
to
prevent
their
escaping
during
war
times
were
very
active
after
freedom
they
intimidated
the
negroes
and
threatened
them
with
loss
of
life
if
they
did
not
stay
and
work
for
their
former
masters
doctor
miller
did
not
want
any
of
his
slaves
treated
in
such
manner
he
told
them
they
were
free
and
could
take
whatever
name
they
desired
robert
lee
during
slavery
was
robert
miller
as
were
all
of
the
doctor
slaves
after
slavery
was
ended
he
chose
the
name
lee
his
brother
aaron
took
the
name
alexander
not
thinking
how
it
looked
for
two
brothers
of
the
same
parents
to
have
different
surnames
there
are
sons
of
each
brother
living
in
palatka
now
one
set
lees
and
the
others
alexander
randall
as
was
formerly
stated
spent
a
very
little
time
in
slavery
most
of
his
knowledge
concerning
customs
which
long
ago
have
been
abandoned
and
replaced
by
more
modern
ones
is
of
early
reconstruction
days
just
after
the
civil
war
when
his
father
began
farming
on
his
own
plantation
his
mother
remained
home
and
cared
for
her
house
and
children
she
was
of
fair
complexion
having
been
the
daughter
of
a
indian
and
negro
mother
her
father
was
white
her
native
state
was
virginia
and
she
bore
some
of
the
aristocratic
traits
so
common
among
those
born
in
that
state
of
such
parentage
she
often
boasted
of
her
blue
blood
virginia
stock
robert
lee
randall
father
was
very
prosperous
in
early
reconstruction
days
he
owned
horses
mules
and
a
plow
the
plow
was
made
of
point
iron
with
a
wooden
handle
not
like
plows
of
today
for
they
are
of
cast
iron
and
steel
chickens
ducks
and
geese
were
raised
in
abundance
and
money
began
accumulating
rapidly
for
robert
and
delhia
lee
they
began
improving
their
property
and
trying
to
give
their
children
some
education
it
was
very
hard
for
those
living
in
small
towns
and
out
in
the
country
to
go
to
school
even
though
they
had
money
to
pay
for
their
education
the
north
sent
teachers
down
but
not
every
hamlet
was
favored
with
such
randall
was
taught
to
farm
and
he
learned
well
he
saved
his
money
as
he
worked
and
grew
to
manhood
years
after
freedom
he
left
south
carolina
and
went
to
palatka
florida
where
he
is
today
he
bought
some
land
and
although
most
of
it
is
hammock
land
and
not
much
good
he
has
at
intervals
been
offered
good
prices
for
it
some
white
people
during
the
boom
of
offered
him
a
few
dollars
an
acre
for
it
but
he
refused
to
sell
thinking
a
better
price
would
be
offered
if
he
held
on
today
finds
randall
lee
an
old
man
with
fairly
good
health
he
stated
that
he
had
not
had
a
doctor
for
years
and
his
thinking
faculties
are
in
good
order
his
eyesight
is
failing
but
he
does
not
allow
that
to
handicap
him
in
getting
about
he
talks
fluently
about
what
he
remembers
concerning
slavery
and
that
which
his
parents
told
him
he
is
between
a
mulatto
and
brown
skin
with
good
mixed
gray
and
black
hair
his
features
are
regular
not
showing
much
negro
blood
he
is
tall
and
looks
to
weigh
about
one
hundred
and
pounds
his
wife
lives
with
him
in
their
frame
house
which
shows
that
they
have
had
better
days
financially
the
man
and
wife
both
show
interest
in
the
progress
of
the
negro
race
and
possess
some
books
about
the
history
of
the
negro
one
book
of
particular
interest
and
of
which
the
wife
of
randall
lee
thinks
a
great
deal

written
according
to
her
story
by
john

for
years
the

she

about

clamoring
for

listened
to
stories
they

because
pap
had
told
them
so
many
times
before
these
narratives
along
with
the
great
changes
he

carefully
recorded
in
the
mind
of

only
one
of
this
group
now
alive
pap
was
always
ready
to
oblige
with
the

families
subsisting
on
any
wild
plant
not
known
to
be

if
it
contained
the
least
food
value
the
freedmen
helped
those
who
were
newly
liberated
to
gain
a
footing
prior
to
emancipation
they
had
not
been
allowed
to
associate
with
slaves
for
fear
they
might
engender
in
them
the
desire
to
be
free
the
freedmen
bore
the
brunt
of
the
white
man
suspicion
whenever
there
was
a
slave
uprising
they
were
always
accusing
them
of
being
instigators
edward
often
heard
his
mother
tell
of
the
a
group
of
white
men
who
caught
and
administered
severe
whippings
to
these
unfortunate
slaves
they
also
corraled
slaves
back
to
their
masters

they
were
caught
out

nine
at
night
without
a
pass
from
their
masters
george
lycurgas
was
born
at
liverpool
england
and
became
a
seaman
at
an
early
age
edward
thinks
he
might
have
had
a
fair
education
if
he
had
had
the
chance
the
mother
julia
gray
lycurgas
was
the
daughter
of
barbara
and
david
gray
slaves
of
the
flemings
of
clay
county
florida
these
slaves
were
inherited
from
generation
to
generation
and
no
one
ever
thought
to
sell
one
except
for
punishment
or
in
dire
necessity
they
were
treated
kindly
and
like
most
slaves
of
the
wealthy
had
no
knowledge
of
the
real
cruelties
of
slavery
but
upon
the
death
of
their
owner
it
became
necessary
to
parcel
the
slaves
out
to
different
heirs
some
of
whom
did
not
believe
in
holding
these
unfortunates
these
abolitionists
were
not
averse
to
placing
at
auction
their
share
of
the
slaves
however
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
george
lycurgas
saw
and
bought
the
girl
who
was
to
become
his
wife
both
are
now
dead
also
all
of
the
several
children
except
edward
who
tells
their
story
here
edward
lycurgas
was
born
on
october
at
saint
augustine
florida
shortly
after
the
return
of
the
family
from
the
west
indies
he
lived
on
his
father
farm
sharing
at
an
early
age
the
hard
work
that
seemed
always
in
abundance
and
listening
in
awe
to
the
stories
of
the
recent
war
he
heard
his
elders
give
thanks
for
their
freedom
when
they
attended
church
and
wondered
what
it
was
all
about
no
one
failed
to
attend
church
on
sundays
and
all
work
ceased
in
a
vicinity
where
a
camp
meeting
was
held
farmers
flocked
to
the
meeting
from
all
parts
of
saint
johns
county
they
brought
food
in
their
large
baskets
some
owned
buggies
but
most
of
them
hauled
their
families
in
wagons
or
walked
the
camp
meetings
would
sometimes
last
for
several
days
according
to
the
spiritual
fervor
exhibited
by
those
attending
lycurgas
recalls
the
stirring
sermons
and
spirituals
that
rang
through
the
woods
and
could
be
heard
for
several
miles
on
a
clear
day
and
the
river
baptisms
these
climaxed
the
meetings
and
were
attended
by
large
crowds
of
whites
in
the
neighborhood
all
candidates
were
dressed
in
white
gowns
stockings
and
towels
would
about
their
heads
bandana
fashion
tow
by
two
they
marched
to
the
river
from
the
spot
where
they
had
dressed
there
was
always
some
stiring
song
to
accompany
their
slow
march
to
the
river
take
me
to
the
water
to
be
baptized
was
the
favorite
spiritual
for
this
occasion
as
in
all
things
some
attended
camp
meetings
for
the
opportunity
it
afforded
them
to
indulge
in
illicit
love
making
others
went
to
show
their
finery
and
there
was
plenty
of
it
according
to
statement
there
seemed
to
be
beautiful
clothing
fine
teams
and
buggies
everywhere
a
sort
of
reaction
from
the
restraint
upon
them
in
slavery
many
wore
clothing
they
could
not
afford
there
seemed
to
be
a
deeper
interest
in
politics
during
these
times
mass
meetings
engineered
by
carpet
baggers
were
often
held
and
largely
attended
although
the
father
of
edward
did
not
hold
with
these
activities
very
much
he
often
heard
the
preacher
point
out
negroes
who
attended
the
meetings
and
attained
prominence
in
politics
as
an
example
for
members
of
his
flock
to
follow
he
believes
he
recalls
hearing
the
name
of
joseph
gibbs
next
to
the
preacher
the
negro
school
teacher
was
held
in
greatest
respect
until
the
year
of
the
shake
earthquake
of
there
were
no
negro
school
teachers
on
saint
john
county
and
no
school
buildings
they
attended
classes
at
the
fort
and
were
taught
by
a
white
woman
who
had
come
from
up
nawth
for
this
purpose
edward
was
able
to
learn
very
little
from
his
blue
back
webster
because
his
help
was
needed
on
the
farm
he
was
a
lover
of
home
very
shy
and
did
not
care
much
for
courting
he
remained
with
his
parents
until
their
deaths
and
did
not
leave
the
vicinity
for
many
years
he
is
still
unmarried
and
resides
at
the
clara
white
mission
jacksonville
florida
where
he
receives
a
email
salary
for
the
piddling

amanda
mccray
mccray
was
sitting
on
her
porch
crooning
softly
to
herself
and
rocking
so
gently
that
one
might
easily
have
thought
the
wind
was
swaying
her
chair
her
eyes
were
closed
her
hands
incredibly
old
and
workworn
were
slowly
folding
and
unfolding
on
her
lap
she
listened
quietly
to
the
interviewer
request
for
some
of
the
high
lights
of
her
life
and
finally
exclaimed
chile
you
look
among
the
living
fer
the
high
lights
there
was
nothing
resentful
in
this
expression
only
the
patient
weariness
of
one
who
has
been
dragged
through
the
boundaries
of
a
yesterday
from
which
he
was
inseparable
and
catapulted
into
a
present
with
which
he
has
nothing
in
common
after
being
assured
that
her
life
story
was
of
real
interest
to
some
one
she
warmed
up
and
talked
quite
freely
of
the
life
and
times
as
they
existed
in
her
day
how
old
was
she
she
confessed
quite
frankly
that
she
never
knowed
her
age
she
was
a
grownup
during
the
civil
war
when
she
was
commandered
by
union
soldiers
invading
the
country
and
employed
as
a
cook
her
owner
one
redding
pamell
possessed
a
hundred
or
more
slaves
and
was
according
to
her
statement
very
kind
to
them
it
was
on
his
plantation
that
she
was
born
amanda
mccray
is
one
of
several
children
born
to
jacob
and
mary
williams
the
latter
being
blind
since
amanda
could
remember
children
on
the
pamell
plantation
led
a
carefree
existence
until
they
were
about
years
of
age
when
they
were
put
to
light
chores
like
carrying
water
and
food
picking
seed
from
cotton
lint
there
were
no
cotton
gins
and
minding
the
smaller
children
they
were
duly
schooled
in
all
the
current
superstitions
and
listened
to
the
tales
of
ghosts
and
animals
that
talked
and
reasoned
tales
common
to
the
negro
today
little
mandy
believes
to
this
day
that
hogs
can
see
the
wind
and
that
all
animals
talk
like
men
on
christmas
morning
at
a
certain
time
children
wore
moles
feet
and
pearl
buttons
around
their
necks
to
insure
easy
teething
and
had
their
legs
bathed
in
a
concoction
of
wasp
nest
and
vinegar
if
they
were
slow
about
learning
to
walk
this
was
supposed
to
strengthen
the
weak
limbs
it
was
a
common
occurence
to
see
a
child
of
two
or
three
years
still
nursing
at
the
mother
breast
their
masters
encouraged
the
slaves
to
do
this
thinking
it
made
strong
bones
and
teeth
at
christmas
time
the
slave
children
all
trouped
to
de
big
house
and
stood
outside
crying
christmas
gift
to
their
master
and
mistress
they
were
never
disappointed
gifts
consisted
mostly
of
candies
nuts
and
fruits
but
there
was
always
some
useful
article
of
clothing
included
something
they
were
not
accustomed
to
having
once
little
mandy
received
a
beautiful
silk
dress
from
her
young
mistress
who
knew
how
much
she
liked
beautiful
clothes
she
was
a
very
happy
child
and
loved
the
dress
so
much
that
she
never
wore
it
except
on
some
special
occasion
amanda
was
trained
to
be
a
house
servant
learning
to
cook
and
knit
from
the
blind
mother
who
refused
to
let
this
handicap
affect
her
usefulness
she
liked
best
to
sew
the
fine
muslins
and
silks
of
her
mistress
making
beautiful
hooped
dresses
that
required
eight
and
ten
yards
of
cloth
and
sometimes
as
many
as
seven
petticoats
to
enhance
their
fullness
hoops
for
these
dresses
were
made
of
that
were
shaped
while
green
and
cured
in
the
sun
before
using
beautiful
imported
laces
were
used
to
trim
the
petticoats
and
pantaloons
of
the
wealthy
the
pamell
slaves
had
a
negro
minister
who
could
hold
services
any
time
he
chose
so
long
as
he
did
not
interfere
with
the
work
of
the
other
slaves
he
was
not
obliged
to
do
hard
menial
labors
and
went
about
the
plantation
all
dressed
up
in
a
frock
coat
and
shoes
he
was
more
than
a
little
conscious
of
this
and
was
held
in
awe
by
the
others
he
often
visited
neighboring
plantations
to
hold
his
services
it
was
from
this
minister
that
they
first
heard
of
the
civil
war
he
held
whispered
prayers
for
the
success
of
the
union
soldiers
not
because
freedom
was
so
desirable
to
them
but
for
other
slaves
who
were
treated
so
cruelly
there
was
a
praying
ground
where
the
grass
never
had
a
chancet
ter
grow
fer
the
troubled
knees
that
kept
it
crushed
down
amanda
was
an
exceptionally
good
cook
and
so
widespread
was
this
knowledge
that
the
union
soldiers
employed
her
as
a
cook
in
their
camp
for
a
short
while
she
does
not
remember
any
of
their
officers
and
thinks
they
were
no
better
nor
worse
than
the
others
these
soldiers
committed
no
depredations
in
her
section
except
to
confiscate
whatever
they
wanted
in
the
way
of
food
and
clothing
some
married
southern
girls
pamell
made
land
grants
to
all
slaves
who
wanted
to
remain
with
him
few
left
so
kind
had
he
been
to
them
all
life
went
on
in
much
the
same
manner
for
amanda
family
except
that
the
children
attended
school
where
a
white
teacher
instructed
them
from
a
blue
back
webster
amanda
was
a
young
woman
but
she
managed
to
learn
to
read
a
little
later
they
had
colored
teachers
who
followed
much
the
same
routine
as
the
whites
had
they
were
held
in
awe
by
the
other
negroes
and
every
little
girl
yearned
to
be
a
teacher
as
this
was
about
the
only
professional
field
open
to
negro
women
at
that
time
after
de
war
negroes
blossomed
out
with
fine
phaetons
buggies
and
ceiled
houses
and
clothes
oh
my
mccray
did
not
keep
up
with
the
politics
of
her
time
but
remembers
hearing
about
joe
gibbs
member
of
the
florida
legislature
there
was
much
talk
then
of
booker
washington
and
many
thought
him
a
fool
for
trying
to
start
a
school
in
alabama
for
negroes
she
recalls
the
negro
post
master
who
served
two
or
three
terms
at
madison
she
could
not
give
his
name
there
have
been
three
widespread
panics
depressions
during
her
lifetime
but
mccray
thinks
this
is
the
worst
one
during
the
civil
war
coffee
was
so
dear
that
meal
was
parched
and
used
as
a
substitute
but
now
she
remarked
you
ca
hardly
git
the
meal
for
the
bread
her
husband
and
children
are
all
dead
and
she
lives
with
a
niece
who
is
no
longer
young
herself
circumstances
are
poor
here
the
niece
earns
her
living
as
laundress
and
domestic
worker
receiving
a
very
poor
wage
mccray
is
now
quite
infirm
and
almost
blind
she
seems
happiest
talking

description
of

in
slavery
at

until
she
was
about
years
old
during
her
slave
days
she
knew
many
of
the
slaves
on
plantations
in
the
saint
augustine
vicinity
several
of
these
plantations
she
says
were
very
large
and
some
of
them
had
as
many
as
slaves
the
who
is
now
years
old
recalls
that
at
least
three
of
the
plantations
in
the
vicinity
were
owned
or
operated
by
minorcans
she
says
that
the
minorcans
were
popularly
referred
to
in
the
section
as
turnbull
darkies
a
name
they
apparently
resented
this
caused
many
of
them
she
claims
to
drop
or
change
their
names
to
spanish
or
american
surnames
christine

christine
describes
the
little
amelia
island
community
as
practically
its
residents
raising
their
own
food
meats
and
other
commodities
fishing
was
a
favorite
vocation
with
them
and
some
of
then
established
themselves
as
small
merchants
of
sea
foods
several
of
the

was

little
who

years
ago
blacksmith
shooting
champion
and
a
number
of
other
things
represents
one
of
the
most
resourceful
former
slaves
yet
found
in
the
state
moore
was
born
in
on
the
plantation
of
john
overtree
in
forsythe
county
georgia
he
was
one
of
the
six
children
of
eliza
moore
all
of
them
remained
the
property
of
overtree
until
freed
on
the
overtree
plantation
the
slave
children
were
allowed
considerable
time
for
play
until
their
tenth
or
twelfth
years
lindsey
took
full
advantage
of
this
opportunity
and
became
very
skillful
at
it
was
here
that
he
first
learned
to
utilize
his
talents
profitably
overtree
discovered
the
ability
of
lindsey
and
another
urchin
to
shoot
marbles
and
began
taking
them
into
town
to
compete
with
the
little
slaves
of
other
owners
there
would
be
betting
on
the
winners
overtree
won
some
money
in
this
manner
lindsey
and
his
companion
being
consistent
winners
but
lindsey
saw
possibilities
other
than
the
glory
of
his
victories
in
this
new
game
with
pennies
that
some
of
the
spectators
tossed
him
he
began
making
small
wagers
of
his
own
with
his
competitors
and
soon
had
amassed
quite
a
small
pile
of
silver
for
those
days
although
shoes
were
in
lindsey
youth
he
used
to
watch
carefully
whenever
a
cow
was
skinned
and
its
hide
tanned
to
make
shoes
for
the
women
and
the
in
the
big
house
through
his
attention
to
the
tanning
operations
he
learned
everything
about
tanning
except
one
solution
that
he
could
not
discover
it
was
not
until
years
later
that
he
learned
that
the
ingredient
was
plain
salt
and
water
by
the
time
he
had
learned
it
however
he
had
so
mastered
the
tanning
operations
that
he
at
once
added
it
to
his
sources
of
livelihood
lindsey
escaped
much
of
the
farm
work
on
the
overtree
place
by
learning
to
skillfully
assist
the
women
who
made
cloth
out
of
the
cotton
from
the
fields
he
grew
very
fast
at
cleaning
clearing
the
looms
and
other
operations
when
at
thirteen
it
became
time
for
him
to
pick
cotton
he
had
become
so
fast
at
helping
with
spinning
and
weighing
the
cotton
that
others
had
picked
that
he
almost
entirely
escaped
the
picking
himself
was
another
of
the
plantation
arts
that
lindsey
mastered
early
his
ability
to
save
every
possible
ounce
of
grease
from
the
meats
he
cooked
added
many
choice
bits
of
pork
to
his
otherwise
meatless
fare
he
was
able
to
spend
many
hours
in
the
shade
pouring
water
over
oak
ashes
that
other
young
slaves
were
passing
picking
cotton
or
hoeing
potatoes
in
the
burning
sun
lindsey
first
knowledge
of
the
approach
of
freedom
came
when
he
heard
a
loud
brass
band
coming
down
the
road
toward
the
plantation
playing
a
strange
lively
tune
while
a
number
of
soldiers
in
blue
uniforms
marched
behind
he
ran
to
the
front
gate
and
was
ordered
to
take
charge
of
the
horse
of
one
of
the
officers
in
such
an
abrupt
tone
until
he
to
shaking
in
my
bare
feet
there
followed
much
talk
between
the
officers
and
lindsey
mistress
with
the
soldiers
finally
going
into
encampment
a
short
distance
away
from
the
plantation
the
soldiers
took
command
of
the
spring
that
was
used
for
a
water
supply
for
the
plantation
giving
lindsey
another
opportunity
to
make
money
he
would
be
sent
from
the
plantation
to
the
spring
for
water
and
on
the
way
back
would
pass
through
the
camp
of
the
soldiers
these
would
be
happy
to
pay
a
few
pennies
for
a
cup
of
water
rather
than
take
the
long
hike
to
the
spring
themselves
lindsey
would
empty
bucket
after
bucket
before
finally
returning
to
the
plantation
out
of
his
profits
he
bought
his
first
pair
of
shoes
though
nearly
a
grown
man
the
soldiers
finally
departed
with
all
but
five
of
the
overtree
slaves
joyously
trooping
behind
them
before
leaving
however
they
tore
up
the
railroad
and
its
station
burning
the
ties
and
heating
the
rails
until
red
then
twisting
them
around
wheat
fields
were
trampled
by
their
horses
and
devastation
left
on
all
sides
lindsey
and
his
mother
were
among
those
who
stayed
at
the
plantation
when
freedom
became
general
his
father
began
farming
on
a
tract
that
was
later
turned
over
to
lindsey
lindsey
operated
the
farm
for
a
while
but
later
desired
to
learn
horseshoeing
and
apprenticed
himself
to
a
blacksmith
at
the
end
of
three
years
he
had
become
so
proficient
that
his
former
master
rewarded
him
with
a
bonus
for
shoeing
one
horse
possessing
now
the
trades
of
blacksmithing
tanning
and
lindsey
was
tempted
to
follow
some
of
his
former
associates
to
the
north
but
was
discouraged
from
doing
so
by
a
few
who
returned
complaining
bitterly
about
the
unaccustomed
cold
and
the
difficulty
of
making
a
living
he
moved
south
instead
and
settled
in
the
area
around
palatka
he
is
still
in
the
section
being
recognized
as
an
excellent
blacksmith
despite
his
more
than
years

in
the
event
that
the
lovers
lived
on
separate
plantations
the
master
of
one
of
them
would
buy
the
other
lover
or
wedded
one
so
that

sacred
ceremony
mack
mullen
recalls
that
many
times
his
marster
on
going
to
view
a
baptism
took
him
along
in
his
buggy
it
was
a
happy
scene
he
relates
the
slaves
would
be
there
in
great
numbers
scattered
about
over
the
banks
of
the
river
much
shouting
and
singing
went
on
some
of
the
sisters
and
brothers
would
get
so
happy
that
they
would
lose
control
of
themselves
and
fall
out
it
was
then
said
that
the
holy
ghost
had
struck
the
other
slaves
would
view
this
phenomena
with
awe
and
reverence
and
wait
for
them
to
come
out
of
it
those
were
happy
days
and
that
was
real
religion
mack
mullen
said
education
the
slaves
were
not
given
any
formal
education
however
mullen
master
was
not
as
rigid
as
some
of
the
in
prohibiting
the
slaves
from
learning
to
read
and
write
snellings
the
mistress
taught
mack
mother
to
read
and
write
a
little
and
snellings
also
taught
mack
father
how
to
read
write
and
figure
having
learned
a
little
they
would
in
turn
impart
their
knowledge
to
their
fellow
slaves
freedom
mullen
vividly
recalls
the
day
that
they
heard
of
their
emancipation
loud
reports
from
guns
were
heard
echoing
through
the
woods
and
plantations
after
awhile
yankee
soldiers
came
and
informed
them
that
they
were
free
snellings
showed
no
resistance
and
he
was
not
harmed
the
slaves
on
hearing
this
good
news
of
freedom
burst
out
in
song
and
praises
to
god
it
was
a
gala
day
no
work
was
done
for
a
week
the
time
was
spent
in
celebrating
the
master
told
his
slaves
that
they
were
free
and
could
go
wherever
they
wanted
to
or
they
could
remain
with
him
if
they
wished
most
of
his
slaves
refused
to
leave
him
because
he
was
considered
a
good
master
they
were
thereafter
given
individual
farms
mules
and
farm
implements
with
which
to
cultivate
the
land
their
former
master
got
a
share
out
of
what
was
raised
there
was
no
more
whipping
no
more
forced
labor
and
hours
were
less
drastic
mack

those
slaves
who
remained

lived
there
until
snellings

cabins
especially
built
for
them
they
were
ceiled
and
arranged
in
such
a
manner
as
to
retain
the
heat
in
winter
from
the
large
fireplaces
constructed
therein
just
before
the
dawn
of
day
the
slaves
were
aroused
from
their
slumber
by
a
loud
blast
from
a
that
was
blown
by
the
driver
as
a
signal
to
prepare
themselves
for
the
fields
the
plantation
being
so
expansive
those
who
had
to
go
a
long
distance
to
the
area
where
they
worked
were
taken
in
wagons
those
working
nearby
walked
they
took
their
meals
along
with
them
and
had
their
breakfast
and
dinner
on
the
fields
an
hour
was
allowed
for
this
purpose
the
slaves
worked
while
they
sang
spirituals
to
break
the
monotony
of
long
hours
of
work
at
the
setting
of
the
sun
with
their
day
work
all
done
they
returned
to
their
cabins
and
prepared
their
evening
meal
having
finished
this
the
religious
among
them
would
gather
at
one
of
the
cabin
doors
and
give
thanks
to
god
in
the
form
of
long
supplications
and
old
fashioned
songs
many
of
them
being
highly
emotional
would
respond
in
shouts
of
hallelujahs
sometimes
causing
the
entire
group
to
become
happy
concluding
in
shouting
and
praise
to
god
the
wicked
slaves
expended
their
pent
up
emotions
in
song
and
dance
gathering
at
one
of
the
cabin
doors
they
would
sing
and
dance
to
the
tunes
of
a
fife
banjo
or
fiddle
that
was
played
by
one
of
their
number
finished
with
this
diversion
they
would
retire
to
await
the
dawn
of
a
new
day
which
indicated
more
work
the
various
plantations
had
white
men
employed
as
patrols
whose
duties
were
to
see
that
the
slaves
remained
on
their
own
plantations
and
if
they
were
caught
going
off
without
a
permit
from
the
master
they
were
whipped
with
a
raw
hide
by
the
driver
there
was
an
exception
to
this
rule
however
on
sundays
the
religious
slaves
were
allowed
to
visit
other
plantations
where
religious
services
were
being
held
without
having
to
go
through
the
matter
of
having
a
permit
religion
there
was
a
free
colored
man
who
was
called
father
james
page
owned
by
a
family
of
parkers
of
tallahassee
he
was
freed
by
them
to
go
and
preach
to
his
own
people
he
could
read
and
write
and
would
visit
all
the
plantations
in
tallahassee
preaching
the
gospel
each
plantation
would
get
a
visit
from
him
one
sunday
of
each
month
the
slaves
on
the
randolph
plantation
would
congregate
in
one
of
the
cabins
to
receive
him
where
he
would
read
the
bible
and
preach
and
sing
many
times
the
services
were
punctuated
by
much
shouting
from
the
happy
ones
at
these
services
the
sacrament
was
served
to
those
who
had
accepted
christ
those
who
had
not
and
were
willing
to
accept
him
were
received
and
prepared
for
baptism
on
the
next
visit
of
father
page
on
the
day
of
baptism
the
candidates
were
attired
in
long
white
flowing
robes
which
had
been
made
by
one
of
the
slaves
amidst
singing
and
praises
they
marched
being
flanked
on
each
side
by
other
believers
to
a
pond
or
lake
on
the
plantation
and
after
the
usual
ceremony
they
were
ducked
into
the
water
this
was
a
day
of
much
shouting
and
praying
education
the
two
missy
girls
of
the
randolph
family
were
dutiful
each
sunday
morning
to
teach
the
slaves
their
catechism
or
sunday
school
lesson
aside
from
this
there
was
no
other
training
the
war
and
freedom
napoleon
relates
that
the
doctor
two
oldest
sons
went
to
the
war
with
the
confederate
army
also
the
white
driver
barton
his
place
was
filled
by
one
of
the
slaves
named
peter
parker
at
the
closing
of
the
war
word
was
sent
around
among
the
slaves
that
if
they
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
it
was
the
yankees
and
that
they
were
free
it
was
in
may
in
the
middle
of
the
day
cotton
and
corn
being
planted
plowing
going
on
and
slaves
busily
engaged
in
their
usual
activities
when
suddenly
the
loud
report
of
a
gun
resounded
then
could
be
heard
the
slaves
crying
almost
dems
de
yankees
straightway
they
dropped
the
plows
hoes
and
other
farm
implements
and
hurried
to
their
cabins
they
put
on
their
best
clothes
to
go
see
the
yankees
through
the
countryside
to
the
town
of
tallahassee
they
went
the
roads
were
quickly
filled
with
these
happy
souls
the
streets
of
tallahassee
were
clustered
with
these
jubilant
people
going
here
and
there
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
yankees
their
liberators
napoleon
says
it
was
a
joyous
and
occasion
when
the
randolph
slaves
returned
to
their
plantation
randolph
told
them
that
they
were
free
and
if
they
wanted
to
go
away
they
could
and
if
not
they
could
remain
with
him
and
he
would
give
them
half
of
what
was
raised
on
the
farms
some
of
them
left
however
some
remained
having
no
place
to
go
they
decided
it
was
best
to
remain
until
the
crops
came
off
thus
earning
enough
to
help
them
in
their
new
venture
in
home
seeking
those
slaves
who
were
too
old
and
not
physically
able
to
work
remained
on
the
plantation
and
were
cared
for
by
randolph
until
their
death
napoleon
father
scipio
got
a
transfer
from
the
government
to
his
former
master
colonel
sammis
of
arlington
and
there
he
lived
for
awhile
he
soon
got
employment
with
a
hatee
of
the
town
and
after
earning
enough
money
bought
a
tract
of
land
from
him
there

douglas
parish
douglas
parish
was
born
in
monticello
florida
may
to
charles
and
fannie
parish
slaves
of
jim
parish
fannie
had
been
bought
from
a
family
by
the
name
of
palmer
to
be
a
breeder
that
is
a
bearer
of
strong
children
who
could
bring
high
prices
at
the
slave
markets
a
breeder
always
fared
better
than
the
majority
of
female
slaves
and
fannie
parish
was
no
exception
all
she
had
to
do
was
raise
children
charles
parish
labored
in
the
cotton
fields
the
chief
product
of
the
parish
plantation
as
a
small
boy
douglas
used
to
spend
his
time
shooting
marbles
playing
ball
racing
and
wrestling
with
the
other
boys
the
marbles
were
made
from
lumps
of
clay
hardened
in
the
fireplace
he
was
a
very
good
runner
and
as
it
was
a
custom
in
those
days
for
one
plantation
owner
to
match
his
nigger
against
that
of
his
neighbor
he
was
a
favorite
with
parish
because
he
seldom
failed
to
win
the
race
parish
trained
his
runners
by
having
them
race
to
the
boundary
of
his
plantation
and
back
again
he
would
reward
the
winner
with
a
or
a
bag
of
marbles
just
to
be
first
was
an
honor
in
itself
for
the
fastest
runner
represented
his
master
in
the
fourth
of
july
races
when
runners
from
all
over
the
country
competed
for
top
honors
and
the
winner
earned
a
bag
of
silver
for
his
master
if
parish
did
win
the
prize
he
was
hard
to
get
along
with
for
several
days
but
gradually
he
would
accept
his
defeat
with
resolution
prizes
in
less
important
races
ranged
from
a
pair
of
fighting
cocks
to
a
slave
depending
upon
the
seriousness
of
the
betting
douglas
first
job
was
picking
cotton
seed
from
the
cotton
when
he
was
about
years
of
age
he
became
the
stable
boy
and
soon
learned
about
the
care
and
grooming
of
horses
from
an
old
slave
who
had
charge
of
the
parish
stables
he
was
also
required
to
keep
the
buggies
surreys
and
clean
the
buggies
were
light
carriages
drawn
by
one
horse
the
surreys
were
covered
carriages
open
at
the
sides
but
having
curtains
that
may
be
rolled
down
he
liked
this
job
very
much
because
it
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
ride
on
the
horses
the
desire
of
all
the
boys
on
the
plantation
they
had
to
be
content
with
chopping
wood
running
errands
cleaning
up
the
plantation
and
similar
tasks
because
of
his
knowledge
of
horses
douglas
was
permitted
to
travel
to
the
coast
with
his
boss
and
other
slaves
for
the
purpose
of
securing
salt
from
the
sea
water
it
was
cheaper
to
secure
salt
by
this
method
than
it
was
to
purchase
it
otherwise
life
in
slavery
was
not
all
bad
according
to
douglas
parish
fed
his
slaves
well
gave
them
comfortable
quarters
in
which
to
live
looked
after
them
when
they
were
sick
and
worked
them
very
moderately
the
food
was
cooked
in
the
fireplace
in
large
iron
pots
pans
and
ovens
the
slaves
had
greens
potatoes
corn
rice
meat
peas
and
corn
bread
to
eat
occasionally
the
corn
bread
was
replaced
by
flour
bread
the
slaves
drank
an
imitation
coffee
made
from
parched
corn
or
meal
since
there
was
no
ice
to
preserve
the
food
only
enough
for
each
meal
was
prepared
parish
seldom
punished
his
slaves
and
never
did
he
permit
his
overseer
to
do
so
if
the
slaves
failed
to
do
their
work
they
were
reported
to
him
he
would
warn
them
and
show
his
black
whip
which
was
usually
sufficient
he
had
seen
overseers
beat
slaves
to
death
and
he
did
not
want
to
risk
losing
the
money
he
had
invested
in
his
after
his
death
his
son
managed
the
plantation
in
much
the
same
manner
as
his
father
but
the
war
was
destined
to
make
the
parishes
lose
all
their
slaves
by
giving
them
their
freedom
even
though
they
were
free
to
go
many
of
the
slaves
elected
to
remain
with
their
mistress
who
had
always
been
kind
to
them
the
war
swept
away
much
of
the
money
which
her
husband
had
left
her
and
although
she
would
liked
to
have
kept
all
of
her
slaves
she
found
it
impossible
to
do
so
she
allowed
the
real
old
slaves
to
remain
on
the
premises
and
kept
a
few
of
the
younger
ones
to
work
about
the
plantation
douglas
and
his
parents
were
among
those
who
remained
on
the
plantation
his
father
was
a
skilled
bricklayer
and
carpenter
and
he
was
employed
to
make
repairs
to
the
property
his
mother
cooked
for
the
parishes
many
of
the
negroes
migrated
north
and
they
wrote
back
stories
of
the
new
country
where
de
white
folks
let
you
do
jes
as
you
please
these
stories
influenced
a
great
number
of
other
negroes
to
go
north
and
begin
life
anew
as
servants
waiters
laborers
and
cooks
the
negroes
who
remained
in
the
south
were
forced
to
make
their
own
living
at
the
end
of
the
war
foods
and
commodities
had
gone
up
to
prices
that
were
impossible
for
the
negro
to
pay
ham
for
example
cost
and
a
pound
lard
was
cotton
was
two
dollars
a
bushel
douglas
father
taught
him
all
that
he
knew
about
carpentry
and
bricklaying
and
the
two
were
in
demand
to
repair
remodel
or
build
houses
for
the
white
people
although
he
never
attended
school
charles
parish
could
calculate
very
rapidly
the
number
of
bricks
that
it
would
take
to
build
a
house
after
the
establishing
of
schools
by
the
freedmen
bureau
douglas
father
made
him
go
but
he
did
not
like
the
confinement
of
school
and
soon
dropped
out
the
teachers
for
the
most
part
were
white
who
were
concerned
only
with
teaching
the
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
the
few
colored
teachers
went
into
the
community
in
an
effort
to
elevate
the
standards
of
living
they
went
into
the
churches
where
they
were
certain
to
reach
the
greatest
number
of
people
and
spoke
to
them
of
their
mission
the
negro
teachers
were
cordially
received
by
the
who
were
glad
to
welcome
some
yankee
niggers
into
their
midst
whereas
the
white
teachers
did
not
bother
with
the
negroes
except
in
the
classroom
other
white
men
came
who
showed
a
decided
interest
in
them
they
were
called
carpetbaggers
because
of
the
type
of
traveling
bag
which
they
usually
carried
and
this
term
later
became
synonymous
with
political
adventurer
these
men
sought
to
advance
their
political
schemes
by
getting
the
negroes
to
vote
for
certain
men
who
would
be
favorable
to
them
they
bought
the
negro
votes
or
put
a
negro
in
some
unimportant
office
to
obtain
the
goodwill
of
the
they
used
the
ignorant
colored
minister
to
further
their
plans
and
he
was
their
willing
tool
the
negro
unwise
use
of
his
ballot
plunged
the
south
further
and
further
into
debt
and
as
a
result
the
south
was
compelled
to
restrict
his
privileges

george

george
pretty
of
vero
beach
and
gifford
florida
was
born
a
free
man
at
altoona
pennsylvania
january
his
father
isaac
pretty
was
also
free
born
his
maternal
alec
mccoy
and
his
paternal
george
pretty
were
born
slaves
who
lived
in
the
southern
part
of
pennsylvania
he
does
not
know
how
his
father
came
to
be
born
free
but
knows
that
he
was
told
that
from
early
childhood
in
altoona
according
to
george
there
were
no
slaves
during
his
life
there
but
in
southern
pennsylvania
slavery
existed
for
a
time
his
moved
from
southern
pennsylvania
during
slavery
but
whether
they
bought
their
freedom
or
ran
away
from
their
masters
was
never
known
to
george
as
in
most
of
the
southland
the
customs
of
the
negro
in
altoona
abounded
in
superstition
and
ignorance
they
had
about
the
same
beliefs
and
looked
upon
life
with
about
the
same
degree
of
intelligence
as
negroes
in
the
south
the
north
being
much
colder
than
the
south
naturally
had
long
ago
used
coal
for
fuel
open
grates
were
used
for
cooking
just
as
open
fireplaces
were
used
in
the
south
iron
skillets
or
spiders
as
they
called
them
were
used
for
cooking
many
foods
meats
vegetables
pies
puddings
and
even
cakes
were
baked
over
the
fire
the
old
familiar
often
referred
to
as
southern
ash
cake
was
cooked
on
the
hearth
under
the
grate
right
in
altoona
pennsylvania
the
north
because
of
its
rapid
advance
in
the
use
of
modern
ways
of
cooking
and
doing
many
other
things
has
been
thought
by
many
people
to
have
escaped
the
crude
methods
of
cooking
but
not
so
george
told
how
a
piece
of
thick
paper
was
placed
on
the
hearth
under
the
grate
and
corn
dough
put
upon
it
to
bake
hot
ashes
were
raked
over
it
and
it
was
left
to
cook
and
brown
when
it
had
remained
a
long
enough
time
the
ashes
were
shaken
off
the
cake
brushed
clean
with
a
cloth
and
no
grit
was
encountered
when
it
was
eaten
isaac
pretty
george
father
owned
a
large
harness
shop
at
altoona
and
made
and
sold
hundreds
of
dollars
worth
of
saddles
and
harness
to
both
northern
and
southern
plantation
owners
there
was
a
constant
going
and
coming
of
northern
and
southern
owners
southern
ones
seeking
places
to
buy
implements
for
farming
and
other
inventions
as
well
as
trying
to
locate
runaway
slaves
abolitionists
were
active
in
the
north
and
there
were
those
who
assisted
slaves
across
the
boundary
lines
between
free
and
slave
states
negroes
in
the
north
who
were
free
and
had
intelligence
enough
saw
the
gravity
in
assisting
their
slave
brothers
in
the
south
some
risked
their
lives
in
spreading
propaganda
which
they
thought
would
aid
the
enslaved
negroes
in
becoming
free
in
and
around
altoona
negroes
were
very
progressive
and
appreciated
their
freedom
and
had
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
for
their
fellows
and
did
all
they
could
to
demonstrate
their
attitude
toward
the
slave
traffic
money
was
solicited
and
freely
given
to
help
abolitionists
spread
propaganda
about
freedom
it
is
striking
to
note
the
similarity
of
living
conditions
in
pennsylvania
and
georgia
florida
and
the
carolinas
who
live
in
florida
now
but
who
came
here
since
the
emancipation
of
the
negro
tell
of
living
conditions
of
their
respective
states
they
are
very
similar
to
the
modes
of
living
in
altoona
during
slavery
soap
was
made
from
grease
and
lye
just
as
it
was
made
in
the
south
paper
money
similar
to
green
back
which
represented
amounts
less
than
a
dollar
were
very
plentiful
and
after
the
civil
war
confederate
money
of
all
kinds
was
as
so
much
trash
food
stuffs
which
were
raised
on
the
farm
at
altoona
were
corn
peanuts
white
potatoes
and
peas
enough
peas
were
raised
to
feed
the
stock
and
take
care
of
the
family
for
months
potatoes
were
raised
in
large
quantities
and
after
they
were
dug
they
were
banked
for
the
winter
by
banked
it
is
meant
large
holes
were
dug
in
the
cellar
of
the
house
or
under
the
house
or
inside
of
an
outhouse
pine
straw
was
put
into
this
pit
and
the
potatoes
piled
in
more
straw
was
laid
on
and
more
potatoes
piled
in
until
all
were
in
the
pit
dirt
was
shoveled
over
the
lot
and
it
was
left
until
for
using
them
northern
people
used
and
still
use
a
large
amount
of
white
or
irish
potatoes
in
curing
hides
of
cows
for
making
leather
the
same
method
was
employed
as
that
used
in
the
south
hides
were
first
salted
and
water
was
poured
over
them
they
were
covered
with
dirt
and
left
to
soak
a
few
days
a
solution
of
red
oak
bark
was
made
by
soaking
the
bark
in
water
and
this
solution
was
poured
over
the
hides
after
it
soaked
a
few
days
the
hair
was
scraped
off
with
a
stiff
brush
and
when
it
dried
leather
was
ready
for
making
shoes
and
harness
george
father
dealt
extensively
in
leather
and
when
he
could
not
get
enough
cured
himself
he
bought
of
others
who
could
supply
him
now
george
mother
was
very
handy
at
the
spinning
wheel
and
loom
he
remembers
how
the
bunch
of
cotton
was
combed
in
preparation
for
spinning
cards
with
teeth
were
arranged
on
the
spinning
wheel
and
the
mass
of
cotton
was
combed
through
it
to
separate
it
into
fibers
the
fibers
were
rolled
between
the
fingers
and
then
put
upon
the
spinning
wheel
to
be
spun
into
thread
as
it
was
spun
it
was
wound
upon
spools
after
the
spools
were
filled
they
were
taken
off
and
put
on
the
loom
threads
were
strung
across
the
loom
some
above
others
and
the
shuttle
running
back
and
forth
through
the
threads
would
make
cloth
all
that
was
done
by
hand
power
a
person
working
at
the
loom
regularly
soon
became
proficient
and
george
mother
was
one
who
bore
the
name
of
being
a
very
good
weaver
of
cloth
most
of
the
clothes
the
family
wore
were
home
spun
underwear
and
sleeping
garments
were
made
of
the
natural
colored
homespun
cloth
when
colored
cloth
was
wanted
a
dye
was
made
to
dip
them
in
so
as
to
get
the
desired
color
dyes
were
made
by
soaking
red
oak
bark
in
water
another
was
made
of
elder
berries
and
when
a
real
blood
red
was
desired
polk
berries
were
used
polk
berries
made
a
blood
red
dye
and
was
considered
very
beautiful
walnut
hulls
were
used
to
make
brown
dye
and
it
was
lasting
in
its
effects
in
making
dye
hold
its
color
the
cloth
and
dye
were
boiled
together
after
it
had
taken
well
the
cloth
was
removed
from
the
dye
and
rinsed
well
the
rinse
water
was
salted
so
as
to
set
the
color
tubs
for
washing
clothes
and
bathing
purposes
were
made
of
wood
some
were
made
from
barrels
out
in
tew
parts
in
cutting
a
stay
was
left
longer
on
each
side
and
holes
were
cut
length
wise
in
it
so
there
would
be
sufficient
room
for
all
of
the
fingers
to
fit
that
was
for
lifting
the
tub
about
a
very
interesting
side
of
george
life
was
depicted
in
his
statement
of
the
longevity
of
his
innocence
we
may
call
it
ignorance
but
it
seems
to
be
more
innocence
when
compared
to
the
incident
of
adam
and
eve
as
told
in
the
holy
bible
in
the
book
of
genesis
he
was
years
of
age
before
he
knew
he
was
a
grown
man
or
how
life
was
given
humans
in
plain
words
he
did
not
know
where
babies
came
from
nor
how
they
were
bred
whenever
george
mother
was
expecting
to
be
confined
with
a
birth
his
father
would
say
to
all
the
children
together
large
and
small
alike
your
mother
has
gone
to
new
york
baltimore
buffalo
or
any
place
he
would
think
of
at
the
time
there
was
an
upstairs
room
in
their
home
and
she
would
stay
there
six
weeks
she
would
go
up
as
soon
as
signs
of
the
coming
child
would
present
themselves
a
midwife
came
cooked
three
meals
a
day
fed
the
children
and
helped
keep
the
place
in
order
in
older
times
people
taught
their
children
to
respect
older
persons
they
obeyed
everyone
older
than
themselves
the
large
children
were
just
as
obedient
as
the
small
ones
so
that
it
was
not
hard
to
maintain
peace
and
order
within
any
home
the
midwife
in
this
case
simply
told
all
of
the
children
that
she
did
not
want
any
of
them
to
go
upstairs
as
she
had
important
papers
spread
out
all
over
the
floor
and
did
not
want
them
disturbed
no
questions
were
asked
she
was
obeyed
george
does
not
remember
having
heard
a
single
cry
the
whole
time
they
were
being
born
in
that
upper
room
and
he
said
many
a
baby
was
born
there
decorum
reigned
throughout
the
household
for
six
weeks
or
until
their
mother
was
ready
to
come
down
when
the
time
was
up
for
mother
to
come
down
his
father
would
casually
say
children
your
ma
is
coming
home
today
and
what
do
you
recon
someone
has
given
her
another
baby
the
children
would
say
almost
in
concert
what
you
say
pa
is
it
a
boy
or
girl
he
would
tell
them
which
it
was
and
nothing
more
was
said
nor
any
further
inquiry
made
into
the
happening
the
term
broke
her
leg
was
used
to
convey
the
meaning
of
pregnancy
george
relates
how
his
mother
told
him
and
his
sister
not
to
have
any
thing
more
to
do
with
mary
jones
cause
she
done
broke
her
leg
george
said
ma
taint
nothin
matter
wid
mary
i
see
her
every
day
when
the
bell
rings
for
she
works
across
the
street
from
pa
shop
and
she
and
me
sets
on
the
steps
and
talks
till
time
fur
her
to
go
back
to
work
his
mother
said

george
i

then
i

george
quickly
replied
no
ma
you
aint
no
lie
but
somebody
done
told
you
wrong
nothing
was
said
further
on
the
question
of
mary
jones
until
that
same
evening
when
isaac
pretty
came
home
from
the
shop
the
mother
took
him
aside
and
told
him
of
how
she
had
been
disputed
and
called
a
lie
by
george
and
added
that
she
wanted
george
whipped
for
it
come
here
george
came
a
commanding
voice
shortly
after
the
mother
and
father
had
been
in
conference
george
obeyed
and
his
father
took
him
apart
from
the
family
and
locked
himself
and
george
in
a
room
he
said
george
i
know
i
have
done
right
by
not
telling
you
you
are
grown
you
are
years
old
now
and
i
want
to
tell
you
some
things
you
should
know
george
was
all
eyes
and
ears
for
he
had
been
told
when
previously
asked
how
old
he
was
i
tell
you
when
you
get
grown
that
was
all
he
had
heard
from
his
parents
for
years
and
he
was
just
waiting
for
him
to
tell
him
his
father
told
him
how
babies
were
born
and
about
his
mother
confining
herself
in
the
upper
room
all
the
different
times
when
she
expected
babies
he
told
him
that
his
mother
had
never
been
out
of
town
to
boston
or
baltimore
on
any
of
the
past
occasions
in
fact
he
told
george
all
he
knew
to
tell
him
now
the
startling
thing
about
it
all
is
that
when
he
had
finished
giving
the
information
about
babies
he
said
now
george
your
mother
told
me
that
you
called
her
a
lie
today
george
at
once
said
pa
i
did
call
her
a
lie
i
jes
told
someone
had
misinform
her
mary
that
she
aint
got
her
leg
broke
cause
i
see
her
every
day
his
father
said
i
know
right
to
whip
you
fur
that
george
but
your
ma
said
she
wanted
me
to
whip
you
and
i
have
to
do
it
that
settled
it
george
received
his
first
lesson
in
sex
and
received
the
last
flogging
his
father
ever
gave
him
he
was
now
grown
and
could
take
his
place
as
a
man
afterwards
the
mother
took
all
her
daughters
aside
and
told
them
the
same
as
isaac
had
told
george
that
is
she
told
the
grown
girls
about
sex
life
george
and
his
older
sister
talked
the
whole
plan
over
after
they
got
a
chance
and
decided
that
since
they
were
now
grown
they
did
not
have
to
give
their
earnings
to
their
parents
any
longer
they
decided
to
move
into
one
of
their
father
houses
on
the
place
and
furnish
it
up
they
were
making
right
good
money
considering
the
times
related
george
and
with
both
of
them
pulling
together
they
soon
would
have
sufficient
money
saved
up
to
buy
a
piece
of
land
and
start
out
on
a
plot
of
ground
of
their
own
george
told
his
father
their
plans
his
father
asked
how
much
money
he
had
he
told
him
dollars
or
more
his
father
said
you
saved
dollars
out
of
what
i
allowed
you
george
answered
in
the
affirmative
his
father
said
do
you
know
how
far
that
will
go
george
said
he
did
not
his
father
answered
not
far
my
boy
a
few
days
after
the
conversation
isaac
pretty
furnished
one
of
his
houses
with
the
necessary
equipment
and
let
george
and
his
sister
live
there
they
had
their
own
and
each
bought
some
food
the
girl
and
george
both
cooked
the
meals
and
did
the
main
thing
they
had
set
out
to
do
letting
nothing
stand
in
the
way
of
their
progress
when
a
few
months
had
passed
both
children
had
accumulated
a
nice
sum
of
money
george
was
prepared
to
marry
and
take
care
of
a
wife
his
sister
eliza
who
lived
with
him
had
saved
almost
as
much
money
and
when
she
married
she
was
an
asset
to
the
man
of
her
choice
rather
than
a
liability
george
had
close
contact
with
nature
in
his
early
life
the
close
contact
with
his
mother
for
years
had
done
something
for
george
which
was
lasting
as
well
as
beneficial
she
was
a
close
adherent
to
nature
she
believed
in
and
knew
the
roots
and
herbs
which
cured
bodily
ailments
this
was
handed
down
to
her
children
and
george
pretty
claims
to
know
every
root
and
herb
in
the
woods
he
can
identify
each
as
they
are
presented
to
him
says
he
doctors
were
never
used
by
the
ordinary
family
when
george
was
growing
up
and
during
his
stay
at
altoona
he
was
called
in
to
sew
up
a
cut
place
which
was
too
much
for
home
treatment
he
was
also
called
in
to
probe
for
a
bullet
but
for
fever
or
colds
or
even
he
was
considered
an
unnecessary
expense
herbs
and
roots
were
widely
utilized
in
olden
days
and
during
slavery
and
early
reconstruction
the
old
slave
has
brought
his
practices
to
this
era
and
he
is
often
found
gathering
and
using
them
upon
his
friends
and
neighbors
george
pretty
knows
that
black
snake
root
is
good
for
blood
trouble
for
he
has
used
it
on
many
a
person
with
safety
and
surety
sasafras
tea
is
good
for
colds
golden
rod
tea
for
fever
fig
leaves
for
thrash
red
oak
bark
for
douche
slippery
elm
for
fever
and
female
complaint
when
bark
is
inserted
in
the
vagina
catnip
tea
is
good
for
new
born
babies
sage
tea
is
good
for
painful
menstruation
or
slackened
flow
fig
leaves
bruised
and
applied
to
the
forehead
for
fever
are
very
affective
they
are
also
good
to
draw
boils
to
a
head
okra
blossoms
when
dried
are
good
for
sores
the
dried
blossoms
are
soaked
in
water
and
applied
to
the
sore
and
bound
with
clean
old
linen
cloth
red
shank
is
good
for
a
number
of
diseases
missing
link
root
is
for
colds
and
asthma
george
said
this
is
a
sure
cure
for
asthma
fever
grass
is
a
purgative
when
taken
in
the
form
of
a
tea
the
blades
are
steeped
in
hot
water
and
a
tea
made
fever
grass
is
a
wide
blade
grass
growing
straighter
than
most
grass
it
has
a
blue
flower
and
is
found
growing
wild
around
many
places
in
florida
it
is
plentiful
in
certain
parts
of
palatka
florida
riding
vehicles
in
early
days
were
called
buggies
the
first
one
george
remembers
was
the
go
cart
it
had
two
wheels
and
was
without
a
top
only
two
people
could
ride
in
a
go
cart
the
equilibrium
was
kept
by
buckling
the
harness
over
and
under
the
horse
belly
the
strap
which
ran
under
the
belly
was
called
the
belly
girt
there
was
a
side
strap
which
ran
along
the
horse
side
and
the
belly
girt
was
fastened
to
this
loops
were
put
to
vantage
points
on
the
side
strap
and
through
these
the
shafts
of
the
cart
were
run
the
strap
going
under
and
over
the
horse
kept
the
cart
from
going
too
far
forward
or
backward
during
george
early
life
plows
looked
very
much
like
they
do
today
they
had
wooden
handles
but
the
part
which
turned
the
ground
was
made
of
point
iron
he
could
not
describe
point
iron
plows
were
not
made
of
cast
iron
or
steel
as
they
are
today
two
kinds
of
plows
were
used
so
far
as
george
remembers
one
was
called
the
skooter
plow
and
the
other
the
turn
plow
the
skooter
plow
he
describes
as
one
which
broke
the
ground
up
which
had
been
previously
planted
when
the
earth
needed
loosening
up
to
make
more
fit
for
planting
this
plow
was
used
over
the
earth
leaving
it
rather
smooth
and
light
the
turn
plow
was
used
to
turn
the
ground
completely
over
where
grass
and
weeds
had
grown
the
earth
needed
turning
over
so
as
to
thoroughly
uproot
the
weeds
and
grass
the
ground
was
usually
left
a
while
so
that
the
weeds
could
die
and
rot
and
then
men
with
hoes
would
go
over
the
ground
and
make
it
ready
for
planting
when
freedom
came
to
negroes
in
the
slave
territory
george
remembers
that
sherman
army
drilled
a
long
time
after
the
civil
war
had
ended
he
saw
them
right
in
pennsylvania
he
was
much
impressed
with
their
blue
suits
and
brass
buttons
and
which
fitted
them
so
well
some
of
the
men
wore
suits
with
braid
on
them
and
they
supposedly
were
the
officers
of
the
outfit
negro
and
white
men
were
in
the
same
companies
he
saw
and
all
were
manly
and
walking
proudly
as
george
was
fifteen
years
of
age
when
freedom
came
much
of
which
he
related
happened
after
emancipation
he
being
out
of
the
slave
territory
did
not
have
as
much
contact
with
the
slaves
but
he
lived
around
his
grand
parents
who
had
been
slaves
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
after
slavery
they
moved
up
to
altoona
with
george
parents
and
brought
much
in
the
way
of
customs
to
george
grandfather
mccoy
and
also
grandfather
pretty
told
of
many
experiences
that
they
went
through
during
their
enslavement
the
negro
and
white
was
much
in
evidence
down
there
and
buying
and
selling
of
children
from
their
parents
seemed
to
have
left
a
sad
memory
with
george
isaac
pretty
family
was
large
he
had
seven
girls
and
seven
boys
george
being
the
eldest
george
remembers
how
his
heart
would
ache
when
his
grandfather
told
of
the
children
who
were
torn
from
their
skirts
and
sold
never
to
see
their
parents
again
he
went
into
deep
thought
over
how
he
would
have
hated
to
have
been
separated
from
his
mother
and
father
to
say
nothing
of
leaving
his
brothers
and
sisters
they
were
brought
up
to
love
each
other
and
the
thought
of
breaking
the
family
ties
seemed
to
him
very
cruel
when
george
was
told
that
he
was
grown
as
formerly
related
he
saved
his
money
and
when
the
great
earth
quake
in
charleston
occured
he
went
down
there
to
see
what
it
had
done
to
the
place
before
that
time
in
he
remembered
having
seen
the
first
block
of
ice
when
he
got
there
the
charleston
people
had
been
making
ice
for
a
few
years
it
was
about
that
time
that
george
saw
the
first
pair
of
bed
springs
george
remained
in
pennsylvania
and
other
states
farther
north
for
a
long
time
after
freedom
his
first
trip
to
florida
was
made
in
he
came
direct
from
altoona
pennsylvania
with
a
white
man
whose
name
he
has
forgotten
as
he
did
not
remain
in
the
man
employ
very
long
after
reaching
the
state
since
that
time
he
has
farmed
in
and
around
different
parts
of
florida
but
now
he
resides
at
tero
beach
and
gifford
florida
he
makes
regular
trips
to
palatka
being
as
much
at
home
there
as
in
the
cities
on
the
east
coast
george
says
that
he
has
never
had
a
doctor
attend
him
in
his
life
neither
while
he
was
in
altoona
nor
since
he
has
been
in
florida
he
claims
to
be
able
to
identify
any
root
or
herb
that
grows
in
the
woods
in
the
state
of
florida
having
studied
them
constantly
since
his
arrival
here
before
coming
to
this
state
he
knew
all
the
roots
and
herbs
around
altoona
and
it
still
acquainted
with
them
as
he
makes
regular
visits
there
since
he
moved
away
years
ago
george
pretty
is
a
dark
complexioned
man
about
five
feet
three
inches
in
heighth
weighs
about
pounds

by
whom
she
was
given
direct
charge
of
the
and
entrusted
with
the
keys
to
the
provisions
and
supplies
of
the
household
a
kindred
love
grew
between
the
slave
girl
and
her
mistress
she
recalls
that
everywhere
her
mistress
went
she
was
taken
also
she
was
kept
in
big
house
she
was
not
given
any
education
though
as
some
of
the
slaves
on
nearby
plantations
were
religion

not
denied
to
the
former
slave
and
her
fellows
abigail

were
allowed
to
occupy
the
balcony
of
the
church
in
dove
city
while
the
whites
occupied
the
main
floor
the
slaves
were
forbidden
to
sing

or
make
any
other
sound
however
under
penalty
of
severe
beatings
those
of
the
slaves
who
the
sperrit
during
a
service
must
keep
silence
until
after
the
service
when
they
could
it
to
the
deacon
a
colored
man
who
would
listen
to
the
confessions
or
professions
of
religion
of
the
slaves
until
late
into
the
night
the
negro
deacon
would
relay
his
converts
to
the
white
minister
of
the
church
who
would
meet
them
in
the
vestry
room
at
some
specified
time
some
of
the
questions
that
would
be
asked
at
these
meetings
in
the
vestry
room
would
be
what
did
you
come
up
here
for
because
i
got
religion
how
do
you
know
you
got
religion
because
i
know
my
sins

forgiven
because
i
love

baptized
yes

do
you
want
to
be
baptized
cause

will
make
me
like

me
to
be
when
several

were
there

a
nearby
creek
or
river
after
this
slaves
would
be
permitted
to
hold
occasional
servives
of
their
own
in
the
log
house
that
was
sometimes
used
as
a
school
scott
remembers
vividly
the
joy
that
she
felt
and
other
slaves
expressed
when
first
news
of
their
emancipation
was
brought
to
them
both
she
and
her
mistress
were
fearful
she
says
her
mistress
because
she
did
not
know
what
she
would
do
without
her
slaves
and
anna
because
she
thought
the
union
soldiers
would
harm
dove
when
the
chief
officer
of
the
soldiers
came
to
the
home
of
her
mistress
she
says
he
demanded
entrance
in
a
gruff
voice
then
he
saw
a
ring
upon
finger
and
asked
where
did
you
get
this
when
told
that
the
ring
belonged
to
her
husband
who
was
dead
the
officer
turned
to
his
soldiers
and
told
them
that
they
should
get
back
she
alright
provisions
intended
for
the
confederate
armies
were
broken
open
by
the
union
soldiers
and
their
followers
and
anna
mother
to
protect
her
master
organized
groups
of
slaves
to
the
meat
from
the
box
cars
and
hide
it
in
dugouts
under
the
mistress
house
this
meat
was
later
divided
between
negroes
and
whites
a
provost
judge
followed
the
advance
of
the
army
and
he
obtained
a
list
of
all
of
the
slaves
held
by
each
master
dove
gave
her
list
to
the
official
who
called
each
slave
by
name
and
asked
what
that
slave
had
done
on
the
plantation
he
asked
also
whether
any
payment
had
been
made
to
them
since
the
emancipation
proclamation
had
been
signed
and
when
answered
in
the
negative
told
them
that
are
free
now
and
must
be
paid
for
all
of
the
work
you
have
done
since
the
proclamation
was
signed
and
that
you
will
do
in
the
future
do
you
work
for
anybody
without
pay
the
provost
judge
also
told
the
slaves
that
they
might
leave
if
they
liked
and
anna
was
among
those
who
left
she
went
to
visit
the
husband
of
her
mother
in
charleston
with
her
mother
and
five
other
children
anna
crossed
rivers
on
log
rafts
and
rode
on
trains
to
charleston
elias
mumford
was
anna
in
charleston
and
after
spending
a
year
there
with
him
the
entire
family
joined
a
colonizing
expedition
to
west
africa
there
were
in
the
expedition
and
it
left
in
transportation
was
free
the
trip
took
several
weeks
but
finally
the
small
ship
landed
at
grand
bassa
mumford
did
not
like
the
place
however
and
continued
on
to
monrovia
liberia
he
did
not
like
monrovia
either
and
tried
several
other
ports
before
being
told
that
he
would
have
to
get
off
anyway
this
was
at
harper
cape
africa
here
he
almost
immediately
began
an
industry
that
was
to
prove
lucrative
oysters
were
as
saucers
according
to
anna
and
while
the
family
gathered
these
he
would
burn
them
and
extract
lime
from
them
this
he
mixed
with
the
native
clay
and
made
brick
in
addition
to
his
mumford
cut
trees
for
lumber
and
with
his
own
brick
and
lumber
would
construct
houses
and
structures
one
such
structure
brought
him
another
manner
in
which
mumford
added
to
his
growing
wealth
was
through
the
cashing
of
checks
for
the
missionaries
of
the
section
ordinarily
they
would
have
to
send
these
back
to
the
united
states
to
be
cashed
and
when
he
offered
to
cash
them
at
a
discount
they
eagerly
utilized
the
opportunity
to
save
time
this
was
a
convenience
for
them
and
more
wealth
for
mumford
anna
found
other
things
besides
happiness
in
her
eight
years
in
africa
there
were
death
sickness
and
pestilences
she
mentions
among
the
latter
the
african
ants
some
of
which
reached
huge
proportions
most
dreaded
were
the
mission
ants
which
infested
every
house
building
and
structure
sometimes
buildings
had
to
be
burned
to
get
rid
of
them
the
bite
of
these
ants
was
so
serious
that
after
sixty
years
anna
still
exhibits
places
on
her
feet
where
the
ants
left
their
indelible
traces
another
of
the
ant
pests
was
the
driver
ant
so
large
powerful
and
stubborn
that
even
bodies
of
water
did
not
stop
them
they
would
join
themselves
together
above
the
surface
of
the
water
and
serve
as
bridges
for
the
passage
of
the
other
ants
the
driver
ants
moved
in
swarms
and
their
approach
could
be
seen
at
great
distances
when
they
were
seen
to
be
coming
toward
a
settlement
the
natives
would
close
their
doors
and
windows
and
build
fires
around
their
homes
to
avoid
them
these
fires
had
to
be
kept
burning
for
weeks
eight
and
more
persons
died
a
day
from
the
african
fever
during
the
early
colonization
attempts
three
of
these
in
anna
family
alone
were
victims
of
it
it
was
generally
believed
that
if
a
victim
of
the
fever
became
wet
by
dew
he
was
sure
to
die
after
eight
years
mumford
and
the
remainder
of
his
family
returned
to
america
where
the
accrued
checks
he
possessed
for
cashing
made
him
reasonably
wealthy

from
his
master
john

bargained
with
his
master
to
obtain
his

however
for
he
did
not
have
the
money
to
readily
pay
him
he
hired

some
of
the
wealthy
plantation

and
applied
what
he
earned
toward
the
payment
for
his
freedom
he
was
a
skilled
blacksmith
and
cabinet
maker
and
his
services
were
always

built
a

he
remembers
well
the
events
that
led
up
to
his
father
burial
he
states
that
the
white
people
dug
his
grave
which
was
six
feet
deep
it
took
them
three
days
in
which
to
dig
it
on
account
of
the
hardness
of
the
clay
when
it
was
finished
he
was
put
sorrowfully
away
by
the
white
folk
who
thought
so
much
of
him
william
was
a
boy
of
nine
at
that
time
and
he
remembers
that
his
mother
was
so
grieved
that
he
tried
to
console
her
by
telling
her
not
to
worry
papa
goin
to
com

some
more
quails

was
fully
evident
states
william

the
davis
family
tree
as
he
knew
it
was
as
follows
three
brothers
sam
thomas
and
jefferson
davis
president
of
the
confederacy
sam
was
the
eldest
of
the
three
and
had
four
children

washington
thomas
had
four
viz
james
richard
rusha
and
minna
jefferson
davis
family
was
not
known
to
william
as
he
lived
in
virginia
whereas
the
other
brothers
and
their
families
lived
near
each
other
at
black
swamp
jack
davis
the
master
of
william
sherman
was
the
son
of
sam
davis
brother
of
jefferson
davis
thomas
and
sam
davis
were
comparatively
large
men
while
jefferson
was
thin
and
of
medium
height
resembling
to
a
great
extent
the
late
henry
flagler
of
florida
east
coast
fame
states
william
many
times
he
would
come
to
visit
his
brothers
at
black
swamp
he
would
drive
up
in
a
buggy
drawn
by
a
horse
he
visited
his
nephew
jack
and
they
would
get
together
in
a
lengthy
conversation
sometimes
he
would
remain
with
the
davis
family
for
a
few
days
and
then
return
to
virginia
on
these
visits
william
states
that
he
saw
him
personally
these
visits
or
sojourns
occurred
prior
to
the
civil
war
jack
davis
being
a
comparatively
poor
man
had
only
eight
slaves
on
his
plantation
they
were
housed
in
log
cabins
made
of
cypress
timber
notched
together
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
having
been
built
regular
lumber
it
was
much
larger
and
of
different
architecture
than
the
slave
cabins
however
the
few
slaves
that
he
had
arose
at
in
the
morning
and
prepared
themselves
for
the
field
they
stopped
at
noon
for
a
light
lunch
which
they
always
took
with
them
and
at
they
quit
work
and
went
to
their
respective
cabins
cotton
corn
potatoes
and
other
commodities
were
raised
there
was
no
regular
overseer
employed
davis
the
master
acted
in
that
capacity
he
was
very
kind
to
them
and
seldom
used
the
whip
after
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
white
men
called
patarollers
were
posted
around
the
various
plantations
to
guard
against
runaways
and
if
slaves
were
caught
off
their
respective
plantations
without
permits
from
their
masters
they
were
severely
whipped
this
was
not
the
routine
for
jack
davis
slaves
for
he
gave
the
patarollers
specific
orders
that
if
any
of
them
were
caught
off
the
plantation
without
a
permit
not
to
molest
them
but
to
let
them
proceed
where
they
were
bound
will
said
that
one
of
the
slaves
ran
away
and
when
he
was
caught
his
master
gave
him
a
light
whipping
and
told
him
to
go
on
now
and
run
away
if
you
want
to
he
said
the
slave
walked
away
but
never
attempted
to
run
away
again
will
states
that
he
was
somewhat
of
a
pet
around
the
plantation
and
did
almost
as
he
wanted
to
he
would
go
hunting
fishing
and
swimming
with
his
master
sons
who
were
about
his
age
sometimes
he
would
get
into
a
fight
with
one
of
the
boys
and
many
times
he
would
be
the
victor
his
fallen
foe
would
sometimes
exclaim
that
that
licking
that
you
gave
me
sure
hurt
and
that
ended
the
affair
there
was
no
further
ill
feeling
between
them
education
the
slaves
were
not
allowed
to
study
the
white
children
studied
a
large
blue
back
webster
speller
and
when
one
had
thoroughly
learned
its
contents
he
was
considered
to
be
educated
religion
the
slaves
had
their
own
church
but
sometimes
went
to
the
churches
of
their
white
masters
where
they
were
relegated
to
the
extreme
rear
john
kelley
a
white
man
often
preached
to
them
and
would
admonish
them
as
follows
you
must
obey
your
master
and
missus
you
must
be
good
niggers
after
the
beginning
of
the
war
they
held
meetings
among
themselves
in
their
cabins
baptism
those
slaves
who
believed
and
accepted
the
christian
doctrine
were
admitted
into
the
church
after
being
baptized
in
one
of
the
surrounding
ponds
cruelties
there
was
a
very
wealthy
plantation
owner
who
lived
near
the
davis
plantation
he
had
eleven
plantations
the
smallest
one
was
cultivated
by
three
hundred
slaves
oftimes
they
would
work
nearly
all
night
will
states
that
it
was
not
an
unusual
thing
to
hear
in
the
early
mornings
the
echoes
of
rawhide
whips
cracking
like
the
report
of
a
gun
against
the
bare
backs
of
the
slaves
who
were
being
whipped
they
would
moan
and
groan
in
agony
but
the
whipping
went
on
until
the
wrath
was
appeased

plantation
encouraged
slaves
to
steal
from
their
masters
and
bring
the
stolen
goods
to
him
he
would
purchase
the
goods
for
much
less
than
their
value
one
time
one
of
the
slaves
put
it
out
that
massa
stokes
was
buying
stolen
goods
stokes
heard
of
this
and
his
wrath
was
aroused
he
had
to
find
the
nigger
who
was
circulating
this
rumor
he
went
after
him
in
great
fury
and
finally
succeeded
in
locating
him
whereupon
he
gave
him
a
good
lacing
and
warned
him
if
he
ever
heard
anything
like
that
again
from
him
he
was
going
to
kill
him
the
accusations
were
true
however
but
the
slave
desisted
in
further
discussion
of
the
affair
for
old
massa
stokes
was
a
treacherous
man
on
another
occasion
one
of
the
stokes
slaves
ran
away
and
he
sent
steven
kittles
known
as
the
dog
man
to
catch
the
escape
the
dogs
that
went
in
pursuit
of
the
runaway
slaves
were
called
nigger
dogs
they
were
used
specifically
for
catching
runaway
slaves
this
particular
slave
had
quite
a
head
start
on
the
dogs
that
were
trailing
him
and
he
hid
among
some
floating
logs
in
a
large
pond
the
dogs
trailed
him
to
the
pond
and
began
howling
indicating
that
they
were
approaching
their
prey
they
entered
the
pond
to
get
their
victim
who
was
securely
hidden
from
sight
they
dissapeared
and
the
next
seen
of
them
was
their
dead
bodies
floating
upon
the
water
of
the
pond
they
had
been
killed
by
the
escape
they
were
hounds
such
as
were
used
in
hunting
escaped
slaves
and
were
about
fifty
in
number
the
slave
made
his
escape
and
was
never
seen
again
will
relates
that
it
was
very
cold
and
that
he
understand
how
the
slave
could
stand
the
icy
waters
of
the
pond
but
evidently
he
did
survive
it
civil
war
it
was
rumored
that
abraham
lincoln
said
to
jefferson
davis
work
the
slaves
until
they
are
about
or
thirty
years
of
age
then
liberate
them
davis
replied
i
never
do
it
before
i
will
i
wade
knee
deep
in
blood
the
result
was
that
in
the
civil
war
that
struggle
which
was
to
mark
the
final
emancipation
of
the
slaves
began
jefferson

laurel
bay
a
swamp
located
on

says
that
what
he
really
meant
was
that
his
master
was
not
going
to
kill
him
because
he
intended
to
run
off
and
go
to
the
yankees
that
afternoon
jack

returned
to
the
front
and
that
night

and
join
the

he
and
his
cousin
who
lived
on
the
davis
plantation
slipped
off
and
wended
their
way
to
all
of
the
surrounding
plantations
spreading
the
news
that
the
yankees
were
in
robertsville
and
exhorting
them
to
follow
and
join
them
soon
the
two
had
a
following
of
about
five
hundred
slaves
who
abandoned
their
masters
plantations
to
meet
the
yankees
en
masse
they
marched
breaking
down
fences
that
obstructed
their
passage
carefully
avoiding
confederate
pickets
who
were
stationed
throughout
the
countryside
after
marching
about
five
miles
they
reached
a
bridge
that
spanned
the
savannah
river
a
point
that
the
yankees
held
there
was
a
union
soldier
standing
guard
and
before
he
realized
it
this
group
of
five
hundred
slaves
were
upon
him
becoming
cognizant
that
someone
was
upon
him
he
wheeled
around
in
the
darkness
with
gun
leveled
at
the
approaching
slaves
and
cried
halt
will
cousin
then
spoke
up
doan
shoot
boss
we
jes
friends
after
recognizing
who
they
were
they
were
admitted
into
the
camp
that
was
established
around
the
bridge
there
were
about
seven
thousand
of
general
sherman
soldiers
camped
there
having
crossed
the
savannah
river
on
a
pontoon
bridge
that
they
had
constructed
while
enroute
from
green
springs
georgia
which
they
had
taken
the
guard
who
had
let
these
people
approach
so
near
to
him
without
realizing
their
approach
was
court
martialed
that
night
for
being
dilatory
in
his
duties
the
federal
officers
told
the
slaves
that
they
could
go
along
with
them
or
go
to
savannah
a
place
that
they
had
already
captured
will
decided
that
it
was
best
for
him
to
go
to
savannah
he
left
but
the
majority
of
the
slaves
remained
with
the
troops
they
were
enroute
to
barnswell
south
carolina
to
seize
blis
creek
fort
that
was
held
by
the
confederates
as
the
federal
troops
marched
ahead
they
were
followed
by
the
volunteer
slaves
most
of
these
unfortunate
slaves
were
slain
by
bush
whackers
confederate
snipers
who
fired
upon
them
from
ambush
after
being
killed
they
were
decapitated
and
their
heads
placed
upon
posts
that
lined
the
fields
so
that
they
could
be
seen
by
other
slaves
to
warn
them
of
what
would
befall
them
if
they
attempted
to
escape
the
battle
at
blis
creek
fort
was
one
in
which
both
armies
displayed
great
heroism
most
of
the
federal
troops
that
made
the
first
attack
were
killed
as
the
confederates
seemed
to
be
irresistible
after
rushing
up
reinforcements
the
federals
were
successful
in
capturing
it
and
a
large
number
of
rebels
general
sherman
custom
was
to
march
ahead
of
his
army
and
cut
rights
of
way
for
them
to
pass
at
this
point
of
the
war
many
of
the
slaves
were
escaping
from
their
plantations
and
joining
the
yankees

of
those
slaves
at
black
swamp
who
did
not
voluntarily
run
away
and
go
to
the
yankees
were
now
free
by
right
of
conquest
of
the
federals
will
now
found
himself
in
savannah
georgia
after
refusing
to
go
to
barnswell
south
carolina
with
the
federals
this
refusal
saved
him
from
the
fate
of
his
unfortunate
brothers
who
went
savannah
was
filled
with
smoke
the
aftermath
of
a
great
battle
lying
in
the
broad

between
beaufort
south
carolina
and
savannah
georgia
were
two

battle
that
resulted
in
the
capture
of
savannah
everything
was
now
peaceful
again
savannah
was
now
a
union
city
many
of
the
slaves
were
joining
the
union
army
those
slaves
who
joined
were
trained
about
two
days
and
then
sent
to
the
front
due
to
lack
of
training
they
were
soon
killed
the
weather

savannah
for
beaufort
south
carolina
which
had
fallen
before
the
yankee
attack
soldiers
and
slaves
filled
the
streets
the
slaves
were
given
all
of
the
food
and
clothes
that
they
could
carry
confiscated
goods
from
the
rebels
after
a
bloody
struggle
in
which
both
sides
lost
heavily
and
which
lasted
for
about
five
years
the
war
finally
ended
may
will
was
then
a
young
man
years
of
age
and
was
still
in
beaufort
he
says
that
day
was
a
gala
day
everybody
celebrated
except
the
southerners
the
slaves
were
thousands
of
federal
soldiers
were
in
evidence
the
union
army
was
victorious
and
sherman
march
was
a
success
sherman
states
that
when
jefferson
davis
was
captured
he
was
disguised
in
women
clothes
sherman
states
that
florida
had
the
reputation
of
having
very
cruel
masters
he
says
that
when
slaves
got
very
unruly
they
were
told
that
they
were
going
to
be
sent
to
florida
so
they
could
be
handled
during
the
war
thousands
of
slaves
fled
from
virginia
into
connecticut
and
new
hampshire
in
william
sherman
left
beaufort
and
went
to
mayport
florida
to
live
he
remained
there
until
then
moved
to
arona
florida
living
there
for
awhile
he
finally
settled
in
chaseville
florida
where
he
now
lives

his
many
years
of
life
he
has
been
married
twice
and
has
been
the
father
of
sixteen
children
all
of
whom
are
dead
he
never
received
any
formal
education
but
learned
to
read
and
studied
taxidermy
which
he
practiced
for
many
years
he
was
at
one
time
inspector
of
elections
at
mayport
during
reconstruction
days
he
recalled
an
incident
that
occurred
during
the
performance
of
his
duties
there
which
was
as
follows
john
doggett
who
was
running
for
office
on
the
democratic
ticket
brought
a
number
of
colored
people
to
mayport
by
boat
from
chaseville
to
vote
doggett
demanded
that
they
should
vote
but
will
sherman
was
equally
insistent
that
they
should
not
vote
because
they
had
not
registered
and
were
not
qualified
after
much
arguing
doggett
saw
that
sherman
could
not
be
made
to
see
the
light
and
left
with
his
prospective
voters
william
sherman
once
served
upon
a
united
states
federal
jury
during
his
colorful
life
in
appearance
he
could
easily
be
regarded
as
a
phenomenon
he
is
years
of
age
though
he
appears
to
be
only
about
his
hair
is
black
and
not
grey
as
would
be
expected
his
face
is
round
and
unlined
he
has
dark
piercing
but
kindly
eyes
he
is
of
medium
stature
he
has
an
exceptionally
alert
mind
and
recalls
past
events
with
the
ease
of
a
youth
the
indian
blood
that
flows
in
his
veins
is
plainly
visible
in
his
features
the
color
of
his
skin
and
the
texture
of
his
hair
he
gives
as
his
reason
for
his
lengthy
life
the
indian
blood
that
is
in
him
and
says
that
he
expects
to
live
for
more
years
today
he
lives
alone
he
raises
a
few
vegetables
and
is
content
in
the
memories
of
his
past
life
which
has
been
full
references
most
of
his
friends
call
him

keep
them
warm

hasten
the
drying

everything
in
order

did
the
most
trusty
work

remember
how
people
wove
cloth
or
spun
thread
or
picked
out
cotton
seed
or
weighed
cotton
or
what
sort
of
bag
was
used
on
the
cotton
bales
i
did
not
need
to
spin
but
i
used
to
play
with
the
spinning
wheels
they
ginned
the
cotton
on
the
plantation
they
used
a
horse
to
pull
the
gin

weighed
the
cotton
with
a
beam
and
weight
a
good
slave
picked
lbs
of
cotton

a
day
nancy
could
pick
or
lbs
in
a
day
go
out
early
in
the
day
and
run
in
ahead
of
the
sun
and
no
one
would
know
she
had
been
out
that
how
she
would
get
ahead
of
the
rest
do
you
remember
what
sort
of
soap
they
used
how
did
they
get
the
lye
for
making
the
soap
they
made
soft
soap
boiled
in
a
big
kettle
they
made
the
lye
out
of
ashes
packed
in
an
old
barrel
that
had
a
hole
in
the
bottom
they
would
make
a
hollow
in
the
top
of
the
barrel
and
pour
rain
water
in
it
this
would
gradually
soak
through
the
ashes
and
seep
out
of
the
bottom
of
the
barrel
which
they
tipped
up
so
that
it
would
drain
the
lye
out
into
a
vessel
then
they
would
take
the
lye
and
boil
it
in
the
kettle
with
old
grease
and
meat
rinds
the
lye
was
very
strong
they
had
to
be
careful
not
to
get
any
of
it
on
their
hands
or
it
would
take
the
skin
off
as
they
would
stir
the
grease
and
lye
it
would
foam
and
cook
like
a
jelly
and
when
it
cooled
we
had
soft
soap
it
would
sure
chase
the
dirt
but
it
was
hard
on
the
hands
what
did
they
use
for
dyeing
thread
and
cloth
and
how
did
they
dye
them

would
dig
indigo
roots
and
cook
the
roots
and
branches
for
blue
dye

purple

mixed
red
and
blue

would
pick
the
berries
off
the
gallberry
bushes
for
red
the
robin
yellow
and
mixed
yellow
and
red
for
orange
and
yellow
and
blue
for
green
did
your
mother
use
big
wooden
washtubs
with
holes
on
each
side
for
the
fingers
yes
we
made
cedar
tubs
on
the
plantation
and
we
had
some
men
who
made
large
wooden
bowls
out
of
juggles
cut
from
logs
of
the
tupla
tree
they
would
run
them
through
a
machine
and
they
would
come
out
round
and
then
they
would
smooth
them
down
they
mixed
bread
in
those
big
bowls
do
you
remember
the
way
they
made
shoes
by
hand
in
the
country

chicken
feathers

goose
feathers

remember
when
women
wore
hoops
in
their
skirts
and
when
they
stopped
wearing
them
and
wore
narrow
skirts
yes
the
doctor
folks
were
so
stylish
that
they
would
not
let
the
servants
wear
hoops
but
we
could
get
the
old
ones
that
they
threw
away
and
have
a
big
time
playing
with
them
and
we
would
go
around
with
them
on
when
they
were
gone
and
could
see
us
do
you
remember
when
you
first
saw
your
first
windmill

remember
when
you
first
saw
bed
springs
instead
of
bed
ropes
yes
when
i
was
a
slave
i
slept
in
a
gunny
sack
bunk
with
the
sacks
nailed
against
the
wall
on
two
sides
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
then
there
was
a
post
at
the
corner
of
the
bed
and
two
poles
nailed
from
the
post
to
the
walls
and
the
gunny
sacks
were
nailed
to
those
poles
my
bed
was
a
bed
there
was
another
gunnysack
bed
above
me
with
poles
fastened
to
the
same
post
we
tore
old
rags
and
made
rag
rugs
for
quilts
to
cover
us
with
i
worked
in
the
doctor
house
in
the
daytime
but
i
had
to
sleep
in
the
shed
at
night
then
after
i
was
a
slave
no
more
i
never
slept
on
anything
else
but
a
rope
bed
when
springs
come
i
wondered
what
anyone
wanted
wid
rope
beds
was
good
enough
when
did
you
see
the
first
buggy
and
what
did
it
look
like
the
doctor
he
had
the
best
of
such
things
he
had
a
regular
buggy
and
sometimes
he
driv
two
horses
in
hit
uncle
albert
he
wuz
his
driver
when
the
doctor
wanted
to
put
on
great
style
and
go
to
the
station
to
meet
some
rich
company
he
had
one
of
the
fancy
cabs
with
the
driver
sittin
up
high
in
front
but
when
he
went
to
see
his
patients
take
his
feet
to
go
around
he
had
two
saddle
packs
with
a
strap
that
he
would
throw
over
his
shoulder
he
would
have
one
pack
hanging
in
front

other
hanging
behind

of

dave
and
soldier
of
fortune
the
reporter
found
the
old
man
sitting
on
the
porch
of
his
iber
city
shack
thoughtfully
chewing
tobacco
and
fingering
his
cane
at
first
he
answered
in
grumpy
monosyllables
but
by
the
magic
of
a
good
cigar
he
gradually
let
himself
go
disclosing
minute
details
of
a
most
remarkable
series
of
adventures
his
language
is
a
queer
mixture
of
geechy
sea
terms
and
broad
a
acquired
by
long
association
with
nassau
conchs
married
to
one
of
these

the
rambler

the

bit
off
a

chew
from
his
small
plug
carefully
wrapped
the
remainder
in
his
handkerchief
and
chewed
thoughtfully
for

before
he
continued

proceeded
slowly

in

almost
unintelligible
at
times
as
he
talked
smoked
and
chewed
all
at
the
same
time
but
here
the
reporter
realized
were
all
the
elements
of
a
true
story
that
needed
only
notebook
and
typewriter
to
transform
it
into
readable
form
antagonism
aroused
by
the
dred
scott
decision
and
the
further
irritation
caused
by
the
fugitive
slave
law
were
kicking
up
plenty
of
trouble
during
buchanan
administration
south
carolina
had
already
seceded
major
anderson
was
keeping
the
union
flag
flying
at
fort
sumter
but
latest
reports
said
that
there
was
no
immediate
danger
of
hostilities
when
pierre
pinckney
thrifty
virginia
planter
of
french
extraction
went
into
conference
with
his
neighbors
and
decided
to
move
while
the
was
still
good
with
as
little
publicity
as
possible
they
arranged
the
disposal
of
their
real
estate
no
need
to
sell
their
slaves
and
livestock
they
would
need
both
in
the
new
location
if
they
could
manage
to
get
to
charleston
they
reasoned
surely
they
could
arrange
for
a
boat
to
augustine
the
indians
might
be
troublesome
there
but
by
settling
near
the
fort
they
should
be
reasonably
safe
before
the
caravan
of
oxcarts
and
heavy
wagons
came
within
sight
of
the
old
seaport
town
it
became
evident
that
they
had
better
keep
to
the
woods
union
soldiers
although
still
inactive
might
at
any
time
decide
to
confiscate
their
belongings
so
they
pushed
on
to
the
southward
long
weeks
dragged
by
before
they
finally
reached
augustine
war
talk
and
the
possibility
of
attack
by
sea
again
caused
them
to
change
their
plans
pooling
their
money
they
chartered
a
boat
and
embarked
for
key
west
surely
they
would
be
safe
that
far
south
one
of
their
virginia
neighbors
fielding
browne
had
settled
there
thirty
years
before
taking
advantage
of
the
periodic
sales
of
salvaged
goods
from
wrecks
on
the
treacherous
keys
he
had
become
wealthy
and
was
said
to
hold
a
responsible
position
with
the
city
everyone
was
in
a
cheerful
mood
as
the
blue
outline
of
key
west
peeped
over
the
horizon
and
all
come
on
deck
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
their
new
home
suddenly
dismay
clutched
at
every
heart
as
a
federal
swung
out
of
the
harbor
and
steamed
out
to
meet
them
the
crisis
had
come
they
ware
prisoners
of
war
pinckney
and
his
neighbors
were
marched
into
fort
taylor
their
wives
children
and
slaves
were
allowed
to
settle
in
the
city
and
care
for
themselves
as
best
they
could
pinckney

consisted
of
one
family
david
taylor
and

with
their
family
of
ten
pickaninnies
colonel
montgomery
federal
recruiting

took
advantage
of
the
helplessness
of
the

to
sow
discord
among

sergeant
and
had
been
sent
north
where
he
was
killed
in
the
attack
on
fort
sumter
his
determined
and
energetic
wife
served
pinckney
faithfully
through
the
war
and
long
afterward
young
dave
or
buddy
son
of
big
dave
although
only
in
his
early
teens
was
her
chief
aid
when
the
war
was
over
and
pinckney
walked
out
of
fort
taylor
a
free
man
the
portly
hannah
the
announcement
that
she
was
a
free
citizen
done
brung
me
heah
she
blustered
with
emphasis
an
heah
gwine
t
stay
some
years
after
the
war
pierre
pinckney
died
when
his
good
wife
became
ill
frantic
dismay
pervaded
the
servants
quarters
as
her
last
moments
drew
near
pinckney
called
the
weeping
hannah
to
her
bedside
and
laid
a
bag
of
money
in
her
hand
to
get
you
and
the
children
back
to
old
virginia
she
whispered
with
her
last
breath
when
the
beloved
missus
was
laid
to
rest
by
the
side
of
her
husband
in
the
catholic
cemetery
the
bewildered
hannah
took
the
money
to
a
white
man
an
old
friend
of
the
family
and
asked
him
to
buy
the
tickets
back
to
virginia
he
advised
against
it
said
that
the
old
home
would
not
be
there
to
comfort
them
houses
had
been
burned
trees
cut
down
and
old
landmarks
destroyed
he
suggested
that
they
take
the
hundred
dollars
in
gold
and
buy
a
little
home
in
key
west
which
they
did
reconstruction
days
were
as
trying
to
key
westers
as
to
others
all
over
the
devastated
land
of
dixie
slave
owners
stripped
of
their
possessions
taxed
with
an
immense
war
debt
and
with
no
money
or
equipment
to
begin
the
slow
climb
back
to
normalcy
were
pathetic
figures
as
they
blistered
their
hands
at
toil
that
they
had
never
known
before
many
of
the
slaves
were
more
than
willing
to
stay
with
their
former
masters
but
with
no
income
the
problem
of
feeding
themselves
was
the
main
issue
with
the
whites
so
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
try
to
fill
other
mouths
and
often
had
to
shift
for
themselves
a
hopeless
task
for
a
race
that
had
never
been
called
upon
to
exert
initiative
hannah
taylor
and
her
numerous
offspring
were
a
fair
example
of
these
irresponsible
people
like
a
ship
adrift
without
skipper
or
rudder
they
were
at
the
mercy
of
every
adverse
wind
of
misfortune
each
morning
they
went
out
with
frantic
energy
to
earn
or
in
some
way
procure
sustenance
for
one
more
day
young
dave
hounded
the
sponge
fishermen
until
they
gave
him
an
extra
job
he
made
the
rounds
of
the
fishing
docks
continually
on
the
lookout
to
be
of
help
anxious
to
do
anything
at
any
time
in
exchange
for
a
few
articles
of
food
that
he
could
carry
proudly
home
to
his
mother

he
kep
to
his

mighty
nigh
a
week
judging
from
the
appearance
of
this
feeble
old
man
one
would
hardly
think
that
he
was
once
a
rollicking
scrapper
with
ready

like
rawhide

old
dave
dutifully
gives
full
credit
to
the
law
of
heredity
m
daddy

he
said
proudly
nevah
done
a
hahd

wuk
in

when
pressed
for
an
explanation
of
this
seeming
phenomenon
the

i
growed
up

while
there
have
been
many
instances
of
atrocious
cruelty
to

uncle
dave
believes
that
other
cases
have
been
unduly
magnified
he
says
that
he
was
never
whipped
by
his
master
but
remembers
numerous
chastisements
at
the
hands
of
miss
jessie
his

of

he
explained
the
perils
of
a
life
at
sea
are
not
as
great
as
fiction
writers
sometimes
indicate
according
to
this
old
sea
dog
he
says
that
in
all
his
voyages
he
has
been
in
only
one
serious
wreck
that
was
on
a

of
coral

he
chewed
slowly
as
he
gazed
out
over
the
dingy
housetops
toward
the
mass
of
feathery
clouds

must
have
been

her
uncle
dave
extended
a
tinted
photograph
his
gnarled
fingers
trembled
as
he
handed
it
over
and
there
was
a
suspicious
softness
in
the
lines
of
his
wrinkled
old
face
as
he
looked
fondly
at
the
likeness
of
the
stolid
dark

with

as

carefully

up

picture
and
put
it
away

the
weight
of
years
has
at
last
cooled
the
hot
blood
but
a
hint
of
departed
swashbuckling
days
still
glistens
in
the
old
eyes
as
he
sits
on
his
narrow
porch
and
recalls
scenes
of
the
old
days
to
one
interested
in
the
psychology
of
the
southern
negro
this
shriveled
old
man
with
his
attitude
offers
an
interesting
study
borrowed
from
a
page
of
history
he
seems
a
curiosity
like
a
fossil
magically
restored
to
life
endowed
with
the
power
of
speech
telling
of
events
so
deeply
buried
in
the
past
that
they
seem
almost
unreal

acie
thomas
thomas
was
at
home
today
there
are
many
days
when
one
might
pass
and
repass
the
shabby
that
is
his
home
without
seeing
any
signs
of
life
that
is
because
he
spends
much
of
his
time
foraging
about
the
streets
of
jacksonville
for
whatever
he
can
get
in
the
way
of
food
or
old
clothes
and
perhaps
a
little
money
he
is
a
heavily
bearded
bent
old
man
and
a
familiar
figure
in
the
residential
sections
of
the
city
where
he
earns
or
begs
a
very
meager
livelihood
many
know
his
story
and
marvel
at
his
ability
to
relate
incidents
that
must
have
occured
when
he
was
quite
small
born
in
jefferson
county
florida
on
july
he
was
one
of
the
slaves
belonging
to
the
folsom
brothers
tom
and
bryant
his
parents
thomas
and
mary
and
their
parents
as
far
as
they
could
remember
were
all
a
part
of
the
folsom
estate
the
folsoms
never
sold
a
slave
except
he
merited
this
dire
punishment
in
some
way
acie
heard
vague
rumors
of
the
cruelties
of
some
slave
owners
but
it
was
unknown
among
the
folsoms
he
thinks
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
certain
po
white
trash
in
the
vicinity
of
their
plantation
owned
slaves
it
was
the
habit
of
the
folsoms
to
buy
out
these
people
whenever
they
could
do
so
by
fair
means
or
foul
according
to
his
statements
and
by
and
by
there
were
no
poor
whites
living
near
them
it
was
he
further
stated
like
damning
a
nigger
soul
if
marse
tom
or
marse
bryant
threatened
to
sell
him
to
some
po
white
trash
and
it
allus
brung
good
results
better
than
tearing
the
hide
him
woulda
done
as
a
child
acie
spent
much
of
his
time
roaming
over
the
broad
acres
of
the
folsom
plantation
with
other
slave
children
they
waded
in
the
streams
fished
chased
rabbits
and
always
knew
where
the
choicest
wild
berries
and
nuts
grew
he
knew
all
the
wood
lore
common
to
children
of
his
time
this
he
learned
mostly
from
cousin
ed
who
was
several
years
older
than
he
and
quite
willing
to
enlighten
a
small
boy
in
these
matters
he
was
taught
that
hooting
owls
were
very
jealous
of
their
night
hours
and
whenever
they
hooted
near
a
field
of
workers
they
were
saying
task
done
or
no
done
night
my
time
go
home
whippoorwills
flitted
about
the
woods
in
cotton
picking
time
chattering
about
jack
marrying
a
widow
he
could
not
remember
the
story
that
goes
with
this
oppossums
were
a
sham
faced
tribe
who
sometimes
wandered
onto
the
wrong
side
of
the
day
and
got
caught
they
never
overcame
this
shame
as
long
as
they
were
in
captivity
all
bull
rushes
and
tree
stumps
were
to
be
carefully
searched
one
might
find
his
baby
brother
there
at
any
time
when
acie
got
up
some
size
he
was
required
to
do
small
tasks
but
the
master
was
not
very
exacting
there
were
the
important
tasks
of
ferreting
out
the
nests
of
stray
hens
turkeys
guineas
and
geese
these
nests
were
robbed
to
prevent
the
fowls
from
hatching
too
far
from
the
hen
house
quite
a
number
of
these
eggs
got
roasted
in
remote
corners
of
the
plantation
by
the
finders
who
built
fires
and
wrapped
the
eggs
in
wet
rags
and
covered
them
with
ashes
when
they
were
done
a
loud
pop
announced
that
fact
to
the
roaster
potatoes
were
cooked
in
the
same
manner
and
often
without
the
rags
consequently
these
two
tasks
were
never
neglected
by
the
slave
children
cotton
picking
was
not
a
bad
job
either
at
least
to
the
young
then
there
was
the
ride
to
the
cotton
house
at
the
end
of
the
day
atop
the
baskets
and
coarse
burlap
sheets
filled
with
the
day
pickings
acie
fondest
ambition
was
to
learn
to
manipulate
the
scales
that
told
him
who
had
done
a
good
day
work
and
who
had
not
his
cousin
ed
did
this
envied
task
whenever
the
overseer
could
not
find
the
time
many
other
things
were
grown
here
corn
for
the
cattle
and
roasting
ears
peanuts
tobacco
and
sugar
cane
the
cane
was
ground
on
the
plantation
and
converted
into
barrels
of
syrup
and
brown
sugar
the
cane
grinding
season
was
always
a
gala
one
there
was
always
plenty
of
juice
with
the
skimmings
and
fresh
syrup
for
all
other
industries
were
the
blacksmith
shop
where
horses
and
slaves
were
shod
the
smoke
houses
where
scores
of
hogs
and
cows
were
prepared
and
hung
for
future
use
the
sewing
was
presided
over
by
the
mistress
clothing
were
made
during
the
summer
and
stored
away
for
the
cool
winters
young
slave
girls
were
kept
busy
at
knitting
cotton
and
woolen
stockings
candles
were
made
in
the
big
house
kitchen
and
only
for
consumption
by
the
household
of
the
master
slaves
used
fat
lightwood
knots
or
their
open
fireplaces
for
lighting
purposes
there
was
always
plenty
of
everything
to
eat
for
the
slaves
they
had
white
bread
that
had
been
made
on
the
place
corn
meal
rice
potatoes
syrup
vegetables
and
meat
food
was
cooked
in
iron
pots
hung
over
the
fireplace
by
rings
made
of
the
same
metal
bread
and
pastries
were
made
in
the
skillet
and
spider
much
work
was
needed
to
supply
the
demands
of
so
large
a
plantation
but
the
slaves
were
often
given
time
off
for
frolics
dances
these
gatherings
were
attended
by
old
and
young
from
neighboring
plantations
there
was
always
plenty
of
food
masters
vying
with
another
for
the
honor
of
giving
his
slaves
the
finest
parties
there
was
dancing
and
music
on
the
folsom
plantation
bryant
the
youngest
of
the
masters
furnished
the
music
he
played
the
fiddle
and
liked
to
see
the
slaves
dance
cutting
the
pigeon
wing
many
matches
were
made
at
these
affairs
the
women
came
all
rigged
out
in
their
best
which
was
not
bad
at
all
as
the
mistresses
often
gave
them
their
cast
off
clothes
some
of
these
were
very
fine
indeed
with
their
frills
and
hoops
and
many
petticoats
those
who
had
no
finery
contented
themselves
with
scenting
their
hair
and
bodies
with
sweet
herbs
which
they
also
chewed
quite
often
they
were
rewarded
by
the
attention
of
some
swain
from
a
distant
plantation
in
this
case
it
was
necessary
for
their
respective
owners
to
consent
to
a
union
slaves
on
the
folsom
plantation
were
always
married
properly
and
quite
often
had
a
sizeable
wedding
the
master
and
mistress
often
came
and
made
merry
with
their
slaves
acie
knew
about
the
war
because
he
was
one
of
the
slaves
commandeered
by
the
confederate
army
for
hauling
food
and
ammunition
to
different
points
between
tallahassee
and
a
city
in
virginia
that
he
is
unable
to
remember
it
was
a
common
occurrence
for
the
soldiers
to
visit
the
plantation
owners
and
command
a
certain
number
of
horses
and
slaves
for
services
such
as
acie
did
he
thinks
that
he
might
have
been
about
years
old
when
he
was
freed
a
soldier
in
blue
came
to
the
plantation
and
brought
a
document
that
tom
their
master
read
to
all
the
slaves
who
had
been
summoned
to
the
big
house
for
that
purpose
about
half
of
them
consented
to
remain
with
him
the
others
went
away
glad
of
their
new
freedom
few
had
made
any
plans
and
were
content
to
wander
about
the
country
living
as
they
could
some
were
more
sober
minded
and
acie
father
was
among
the
latter
he
remained
on
the
folsom
place
for
a
short
while
he
then
settled
down
to
in
jefferson
county
their
first
year
was
the
hardest
because
of
the
many
adjustments
that
had
to
be
made
then
things
became
better
by
means
of
hard
work
and
the
of
friendly
whites
the
slaves
in
the
section
soon
learned
to
shift
for
themselves
northerners
came
south
in
swarms
and
opened
schools
for
the
but
acie
was
not
fortunate
enough
to
get
very
far
in
his
blue
back
webster
there
was
too
much
work
to
be
done
and
his
father
trying
to
buy
the
land
nor
did
he
take
an
interest
in
the
political
meetings
held
in
the
neighborhood
his
parents
shared
with
him
the
common
belief
that
such
things
were
not
to
be
shared
by
the
humble
some
believed
that
too
much
book
learning
made
the
brain
weak
acie
met
and
married
keziah
wright
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
woman
his
mother
had
known
in
slavery
strangely
enough
they
had
never
met
as
children
with
his
wife
he
remained
in
jefferson
county
where
nine
of
their
thirteen
children
were
born
with
his
family
he
moved
to
jacksonville
and
had
been
living
here
a
right
good
while
when
the
fire
occurred
in

and
lives
within
a
few
feet
of
the
spot
where
his
house
burned
many
years
ago
he
was
very
sad
as
he
pointed
out
this
spot
to
his
visitor
a
few
scraggly
hedges
and
an
apple
tree
a
charred
bit
of
fence
a
chimney

the
only
markers

have
a
home
his
land

thomas
sits
in
the
sun
in
front
of
his
hut
on
the
old
saint
augustine
road
about
three
miles
south
of
jacksonville
years
old
and
full
of
humorous
reminiscences
about
most
of
those
years
to
his
frequent
visitors
he
relates
tales
of
his
past
disjointedly
sometimes
but
with
a
remarkable
clearness
and
conviction
the
old
does
not
remember
the
exact
time
of
his
birth
except
that
it
was
in
the
year
the
day
after
the
end
of
the
indian
war
he
does
not
recall
which
of
the
indian
wars
but
says
that
it
was
while
there
were
still
many
indians
in
west
florida
who
were
very
hard
for
him
to
understand
when
he
got
big
enough
to
talk
to
them
he
was
born
he
says
on
a
great
big
place
that
to
mister
jim
campbell
i
do
know
just
exactly
how
big
but
there
was
a
lot
of
us
working
on
it
when
i
was
a
little
fellow
the
place
was
evidently
one
of
the
plantations
near
tallahassee
thomas
remembers
that
as
soon
as
he
was
large
enough
he
helped
his
parents
and
others
raise
corn
peanuts
a
little
bit
of
cotton
and
potatoes
squash
just
grew
wild
in
the
woods
we
used
to
eat
them
when
we
could
get
anything
else
much
the
centennarian
remembers
his
parents
clearly
his
mother
was
one
nancy
and
his
father
name
was
adam
his
father
he
says
used
to
spend
hours
after
the
candles
were
out
telling
him
and
his
brothers
about
his
capture
and
subsequent
slavery
adam
was
a
native
of
the
west
coast
of
africa
and
when
quite
a
young
man
was
attracted
one
day
to
a
large
ship
that
had
just
come
near
his
home
with
many
others
he
was
attracted
aboard
by
bright
red
handkerchiefs
shawls
and
other
articles
in
the
hands
of
the
seamen
shortly
afterwards
he
was
securely
bound
in
the
hold
of
the
ship
to
be
later
sold
somewhere
in
america
thomas
does
not
know
exactly
where
adam
landed
but
knows
that
his
father
had
been
in
florida
many
years
before
his
birth
i
guess
that
why
i
ca
stand
red
things
now
he
says
my
pa
hated
the
sight
of
it
thomas
spent
all
of
his
enslaved
years
on
the
campbell
plantation
where
he
describes
conditions
as
better
than
he
used
to
hear
they
was
on
the
other
places
campbell
himself
is
described
as
moderate
if
not
actually
kindly
he
did
not
permit
his
slaves
to
be
beaten
to
any
great
extent
the
most
he
would
give
us
was
a
and
most
of
the
time
we
could
pray
out
of
that
but
sometimes
he
would
get
a
hard
man
working
for
him
though
the
old
man
continues
one
of
them
used
to
and
gag
us
this
he
describes
as
a
punishment
used
particularly
with
runaways
where
the
slave
would
be
gagged
and
tied
in
a
squatting
position
and
left
in
the
sun
for
hours
he
claims
to
have
seen
other
slaves
suspended
by
their
thumbs
for
varying
periods
he
repeats
though
that
these
were
not
campbell
practices
during
the
years
before
surrinder
thomas
saw
much
traffic
in
slaves
he
says
each
year
around
new
years
itinerant
speculators
would
come
to
his
vicinity
and
either
hold
a
public
sale
or
lead
the
slaves
tied
together
to
the
plantation
for
inspection
or
sale
a
whole
lot
of
times
they
would
sell
they
just
trade
like
they
did
horses
the
man
plantation
owner
would
have
a
couple
of
old
women
who
could
do
much
any
more
and
he
swap
to
the
other
man
for
a
young
i
seen
lots
of
traded
that
way
and
sold
for
money
too
thomas
recalls
at
least
one
indian
family
that
lived
in
his
neighborhood
until
he
left
it
after
the
war
this
family
he
says
did
not
work
but
had
a
little
place
of
their
own
they
did
have
much
to
do
with
nobody
though
he
adds
others
of
his
neighbors
during
these
early
years
were
white
residents
of
the
area
these
he
says
would
take
in
runaway
slaves
and
either
work
or
hide
until
they
could
try
to
get
north
when
they
get
caught
at
it
though
they
take
to
town
and
beat
like
they
would
us
then
take
their
places
and
run
out
later
he
came
to
know
the
and
the
refugees
of
the
former
he
has
only
to
say
that
they
gave
him
a
lot
of
trouble
every
time
he
did
have
a
pass
to
leave
they
only
give
me
one
twice
a
week
and
of
the
latter
that
it
was
they
who
induced
the
slaves
of
campbell
to
remain
and
finish
their
crop
after
the
emancipation
receiving
of
it
for
their
share
he
states
that
campbell
exceeded
this
amount
in
the
division
later
after
thomas
and
his
relatives
remained
on
the
campbell
place
working
for
a
month
payable
at
each
christmas
he
recalls
how
rich
he
felt
with
this
money
as
compared
with
the
other
free
negroes
in
the
section
all
of
the
children
and
his
mother
were
paid
this
amount
he
states
the
old
man
remembers
very
clearly
the
customs
that
prevailed
both
before
and
after
his
freedom
on
the
plantation
he
says
they
never
faced
actual
want
of
food
although
his
meals
were
plain
he
ate
mostly
corn
meal
and
bacon
and
squash
and
potatoes
he
adds
and
every
now
and
then
we
eat
more
than
that
he
does
recall
exactly
what
but
says
it
was
oh
lots
of
greens
and
cabbage
and
syrul
and
sometimes
plenty
of
meat
too
his
mother
and
the
other
women
were
given
white
cotton
he
thinks
it
may
have
been
duck
dresses
every
now
and
then
he
states
but
none
of
the
women
really
had
to
confine
themselves
to
white
cause
they
dye
as
soon
as
they
get
for
dye
he
says
they
would
boil
wild
indigo
poke
berries
walnuts
and
some
tree
for
which
he
has
an
undecipherable
name
campbell
slaves
did
not
have
to
go
barefoot
not
during
the
colder
months
anyway
as
soon
as
winter
would
come
each
one
of
them
was
given
a
pair
of
bright
untanned
leather
brogans
that
would
be
the
envy
of
the
vicinity
soap
for
the
slaves
was
made
by
the
women
of
the
plantation
by
burning
blackjack
wood
and
other
materials
then
adding
the
accumulated
fat
of
the
past
few
weeks
for
light
they
were
given
tallow
candles
asked
if
there
was
any
certain
time
to
put
the
candles
out
at
night
thomas
answers
that
campbell
did
care
how
late
you
stayed
up
at
night
just
so
you
was
ready
to
work
at
daybreak
the
does
remember
any
feathers
in
the
covering
for
his
pallet
in
the
corner
of
his
cabin
but
says
that
campbell
always
provided
the
slaves
with
blankets
and
the
women
with
quilts
by
the
time
he
was
given
his
freedom
thomas
had
learned
several
trades
in
addition
to
farming
one
of
them
was
carpentry
when
he
eventually
left
his
a
month
job
with
his
master
he
began
travelling
over
the
state
a
practice
he
has
not
discontinued
until
the
present
he
worked
he
says
in
such
towns
as
perry
sarasota
clearwater
and
every
town
in
florida
down
to
where
the
ocean
goes
under
the
bridge
probably
key
west
he
came
to
jacksonville
about
what
he
believes
to
be
half
a
century
ago
he
remembers
that
it
was
ever
so
long
before
the
fire
and
way
back
there
when
there
was
but
three
families
over
here
in
south
jacksonville
the
sahds
the
hendricks
and
the
oaks
i
worked
for
all
of
them
but
i
worked
for
bowden
the
longest
the
reference
is
to
bowden
whom
thomas
claims
as
one
of
his
first
employers
in
this
section
the
old
man
has
children
the
eldest
of
those
living
looking
older
than
thomas
himself
this
child
is
years
he
has
been
married
three
times
and
lives
now
with
his
year
old
wife
in
front
of
his
shack
is
a
huge
spreading
oak
tree
he
says
that
there
were
three
of
them
that
he
and
his
wife
tended
when
they
first
moved
to
jacksonville
that
one
there
was
so
little
that
i
used
to
trim
it
with
my
he
states
the
tree
he
mentioned
is
now
about
feet
in
diameter
right
after
my
first
wife
died
one
of
them
trees
withered
the
old
man
tells
you
i
did
all
i
could
to
save
the
other
one
but
pretty
soon
it
was
gone
too
i
guess
this
other
one
is
waiting
for
me
he
laughs
and
points
to
the
remaining
oak
thomas
protests
that
his
health
is
excellent
except
for
just
a
little
haze
that
comes
over
my
eyes
and
i
ca
see
so
good
he
claims
that
he
has
no
physical
aches
and
pains
despite
the
more
than
a
century
his
voice
is
lively
and
his
hearing
fair
and
his
desire
for
travel
still
very
much
alive
when
interviewed
he
had
just
completed
a
trip
to
a
daughter
in
clearwater
and
would
have
gone
farther
than
that
but
my
son
would

blocks
for
sale
and
was
purchased
by
a
mormon
at
the
marriage
of
mormon
daughter
sarah
according
to
custom
he
was
given
to
this
daughter
as
a
wedding
present
and
thus
became
the
slave
and
took
the
name
of
the
gulleys
and
lived
with
them
until
he
became
a
young
man
at
smithville
georgia
in
lee
county
his
chief
work
was
that
of
carrying
water
wood
and
working
around
the
house
when
a
youngster
often
he
states
he
would
hide
in
the
woods
to
keep
from
working
because
his
mother
was
a
woman
she
did
not
know
the
hard
labors
of
slavery
but
had
a
small
patch
of
cotton
and
a
garden
near
the
house
to
care
for
all
of
the
others
worked
hard
said
he
but
had
kind
masters
who
fed
them
well
when
asked
if
his
mother
were
a
christian
he
replied
why
yes
indeed
she
was
and
believed
in
prayer
one
day
as
she
traveled
from
her
patch
home
just
as
she
was
about
to
let
the
this
was
a
fence
built
to
keep
the
hogs
and
horses
shut
in
down
she
knelt
to
pray
and
a
light
appeared
before
her
and
from
that
time
on
she
did
not
believe
in
any
fogyism
but
in
god
i
can
not
remember
much
now
he
says
of
what
happened
in
slavery
but
after
slavery
we
went
back
to
the
name
of

i
know
i
got
some
whippings

during

having
a
remarkable
memory
and
has
many
times
publicly
delivered

from
many
of
shakespeare

his
memory
began
failing
him
in
he
is
very
well
educated
and
now
spends
most
of
his

willis
williams
of
iverson
street
jacksonville
florida
was
born
at
tallahassee
florida
september
he
was
the
son
of
ransom
and
wilhemina
williams
who
belonged
during
the
period
of
slavery
to
thomas
heyward
a
rich
merchant
of
tallahassee
willis
does
not
know
the
names
of
his
paternal
grandparents
but
remembers
his
maternal
grandmother
was
rachel
fitzgiles
who
came
down
to
visit
the
family
after
the
civil
war
thomas
heyward
the
master
owned
a
plantation
out
in
the
country
from
tallahassee
and
kept
slaves
out
there
he
also
owned
a
fine
home
in
the
city
as
well
as
a
large
grocery
store
and
produce
house
willis
mother
wilhemina
was
the
cook
at
the
town
house
and
his
father
williams
did
carpentry
and
other
light
work
around
the
place
he
does
not
remember
how
his
father
learned
the
trade
but
presumes
that
heyward
put
him
under
a
white
carpenter
until
he
had
learned
the
first
he
remembers
of
his
father
was
that
he
did
carpentry
work
at
the
time
willis
was
born
and
during
his
early
life
even
rich
people
like
heyward
did
not
have
cook
stoves
they
knew
nothing
of
such
the
only
means
of
cooking
was
by
fireplace
which
as
he
remembers
was
wide
with
an
iron
rod
across
it
to
the
rod
a
large
iron
pot
was
suspended
and
in
it
food
was
cooked
an
iron
skillet
with
a
lid
was
used
for
baking
and
it
also
was
used
to
cook
meats
and
other
food
the
common
name
for
the
utensil
was
and
every
home
had
one
willis
fared
well
during
the
first
nine
years
of
his
life
which
were
spent
in
slavery
to
him
it
was
the
same
as
freedom
for
he
was
not
a
victim
of
any
unpleasant
experiences
as
related
by
some
other
he
played
base
ball
and
looked
after
his
younger
brothers
and
sister
while
his
mother
was
in
the
kitchen
he
was
never
flogged
but
received
chastisement
once
from
the
father
of
heyward
that
he
related
was
light
and
not
nearly
so
severe
as
many
parents
give
their
children
today
wilhemina
his
mother
and
the
cook
saw
to
it
that
her
children
were
well
fed
they
were
fed
right
from
the
master
table
so
to
speak
they
did
not
sit
to
the
table
with
the
master
and
his
family
but
ate
the
same
kind
of
food
that
was
served
them
cornbread
was
baked
in
the
heyward
kitchen
but
biscuits
also
were
baked
twice
daily
and
the
negroes
were
allowed
to
eat
as
many
as
they
wished
the
dishes
were
made
of
tin
and
the
drinking
vessels
were
made
from
gourds
few
white
people
had
china
dishes
and
when
they
did
possess
them
they
were
highly
prized
and
great
care
was
taken
of
them
the
few
other
slaves
which
heyward
kept
around
the
town
house
tended
the
garden
and
the
many
chickens
ducks
and
geese
on
the
place
the
garden
afforded
all
of
the
vegetables
necessary
for
feeding
master
heyward
his
family
and
slaves
he
did
not
object
to
the
slaves
eating
chicken
and
green
vegetables
and
sent
provisions
of
all
kinds
from
his
store
to
boot
although
heyward
was
wealthy
there
were
many
things
he
could
not
buy
for
tallahassee
did
not
afford
them
willis
remembers
that
candles
were
mostly
used
for
light
tallow
was
used
in
making
them
the
moulds
which
were
made
of
wood
were
of
the
correct
size
cotton
string
twisted
right
from
the
raw
cotton
was
cut
into
desired
length
and
placed
in
the
moulds
first
then
heated
tallow
was
poured
in
until
they
were
filled
the
tallow
was
allowed
to
set
and
cool
then
they
were
removed
ready
for
use
in
those
days
coffee
was
very
expensive
and
a
substitute
for
it
was
made
from
parched
corn
the
whites
used
it
as
well
as
the
slaves
willis
remembers
a
man
named
pierce
who
cured
cow
hides
he
used
to
buy
them
and
one
time
willis
skinned
a
cow
and
took
the
hide
to
him
and
sold
it
and
seventy
years
ago
everyone
used
horses
or
mules
and
they
had
to
have
shoes
the
blacksmith
wore
leather
aprons
and
the
horses
and
mules
wore
leather
collars
no
one
knew
anything
about
composition
leather
for
making
shoes
so
the
tanning
of
hides
was
a
lucrative
business
clothing
during
civil
war
days
and
early
reconstruction
was
simple
as
compared
to
present
day
togs
cloth
woven
from
homespun
thread
was
the
only
kind
negroes
had
every
house
of
any
note
could
boast
of
a
spinning
wheel
and
loom
cotton
picked
by
slaves
was
cleared
of
the
seed
and
spun
into
thread
and
woven
into
cloth
by
them
it
was
common
to
know
how
to
spin
and
weave
some
of
the
cloth
was
dyed
afterwards
with
dye
made
from
indigo
and
polk
berries
some
was
used
in
its
natural
color
cotton
was
the
main
product
of
most
southern
plantations
and
the
owner
usually
depended
upon
the
income
from
the
sale
of
his
yearly
crop
to
maintain
his
home
and
upkeep
of
his
slaves
and
cattle
it
was
necessary
for
every
farm
to
yield
as
much
as
possible
and
much
energy
was
directed
toward
growing
and
picking
large
crops
although
heyward
was
a
successful
merchant
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
his
country
property
could
yield
a
bountiful
supply
of
cotton
corn
and
tobacco
around
the
town
house
heyward
maintained
an
atmosphere
of
home
life
he
wanted
his
family
and
his
servants
well
cared
for
and
spared
no
expense
in
making
life
happy
as
willis
remembers
the
beds
were
made
of
florida
moss
and
feathers
boards
ware
laid
across
for
slats
and
the
mattress
placed
upon
the
boards
on
top
of
the
moss
mattress
a
feather
one
was
placed
which
made
sleeping
very
comfortable
in
summer
the
feather
mattress
was
often
removed
sunned
aired
and
replaced
in
winter
goose
and
the
downy
feathers
of
chickens
were
saved
and
stored
in
large
bags
until
enough
were
collected
for
a
mattress
and
it
was
considered
a
prize
to
possess
one
every
family
of
note
boasted
the
ownership
of
a
horse
and
buggy
or
several
of
each
the
kind
most
popular
during
willis
boyhood
was
the
affair
with
a
short
bed
in
the
rear
of
the
seat
sometimes
two
seats
were
used
the
seats
were
removable
and
could
be
used
for
carrying
baggage
or
other
light
weights
the
brougham
surrey
and
landam
were
unknown
to
willis
before
the
civil
war
and
during
the
time
the
great
struggle
was
in
full
swing
women
wore
hoop
skirts
very
full
held
out
with
metal
hoops
pantaloons
were
worn
beneath
them
and
around
the
ankle
where
they
were
gathered
very
closely
a
ruffle
edged
with
a
narrow
lace
finished
them
off
the
waist
was
tight
fitting
basque
and
sleeves
which
could
be
worn
long
or
to
elbow
were
very
full
women
also
wore
their
hair
high
up
on
their
heads
with
frills
around
the
face
negro
women
right
after
slavery
fell
into
imitating
their
former
mistresses
and
many
of
them
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
get
employment
used
part
of
their
earnings
for
at
least
one
good
dress
it
was
usually
made
of
woolen
a
yard
wide
or
silk
money
has
undergone
a
change
as
rapidly
as
some
other
commonplace
things
in
willis
early
life
money
valued
at
less
than
one
dollar
was
made
of
paper
just
as
the
dollar
five
dollar
or
ten
dollar
bills
were
there
was
a
difference
however
in
the
paper
representing
and
not
as
much
care
was
taken
in
protecting
it
from
being
imitated
the
paper
money
used
for
change
was
called
shin
plasters
and
much
of
it
flooded
the
southland
during
civil
war
days
heyward
did
not
enlist
in
the
army
to
help
protect
the
demise
but
his
eldest
son
charlie
went
his
younger
son
was
not
old
enough
to
go
willis
stated
that
heyward
did
not
go
because
he
was
in
business
and
was
needed
at
home
to
look
after
it
it
is
not
known
whether
charlie
was
killed
at
war
or
not
but
willis
said
he
did
not
return
home
at
the
close
of
war
when
the
news
of
freedom
came
to
thomas
heyward
town
slaves
it
was
brought
by
mccook
cavalry
willis
remembers
the
uniforms
worn
by
the
northerners
was
dark
blue
with
brass
buttons
and
the
confederates
wore
gray
after
the
cavalry
reached
tallahassee
they
separated
into
sections
each
division
taking
a
different
part
of
the
town
negroes
of
the
household
were
called
together
and
were
informed
of
their
freedom
it
is
remembered
by
willis
that
the
slaves
were
jubilant
but
not
boastful
heyward
was
dealt
a
hard
blow
during
the
war
his
store
was
confiscated
and
used
as
a
commissary
by
the
northern
army
when
the
war
ended
he
was
deprived
of
his
slaves
and
a
great
portion
of
his
former
wealth
vanished
with
their
going
the
loss
of
his
wealth
and
slaves
did
not
bitter
heyward
to
the
contrary
he
was
as
kindhearted
as
in
days
past
mccook
cavalry
did
not
remain
in
tallahassee
very
long
and
was
replaced
by
a
colored
company
the
infantry
their
duty
was
to
maintain
order
within
the
town
an
orchestra
was
with
the
outfit
and
willis
remembers
that
they
were
very
good
musicians
a
negro
who
had
been
the
slave
of
a
man
of
tallahassee
was
a
member
of
the
orchestra
his
name
was
singleton
and
his
former
master
invited
the
orchestra
to
come
to
his
house
and
play
for
the
family
the
negroes
were
glad
to
render
service
went
and
after
that
entertained
many
white
families
in
their
homes
the
southern
soldiers
who
returned
after
the
war
appeared
to
receive
their
defeat
as
good
and
not
as
much
friction
between
the
races
existed
as
would
be
imagined
the
while
he
was
glad
to
be
free
wanted
to
be
sheltered
under
the
of
his
former
master
and
mistress
in
most
cases
they
were
hired
by
their
former
owners
and
peace
reigned
around
the
home
or
plantation
this
was
true
of
tallahassee
if
not
of
other
sections
of
the
south
soon
after
the
smoke
of
the
cannons
had
died
down
and
people
began
thinking
of
the
future
the
negroes
turned
their
thoughts
toward
education
they
grasped
every
opportunity
to
learn
to
read
and
write
schools
were
fostered
by
northern
white
capitalists
and
white
women
were
sent
into
the
southland
to
teach
the
colored
boys
and
girls
to
read
write
and
figure
any
negro
who
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
gain
some
knowledge
during
slavery
could
get
a
position
as
school
teacher
as
a
result
many
poorly
prepared
persons
entered
the
school
room
as
tutor
william
williams
willis
father
found
work
at
the
old
florida
central
and
peninsular
railroad
yards
and
worked
for
many
years
there
he
sent
his
children
to
school
and
willis
advanced
rapidly
during
slavery
negroes
attended
church
sat
in
the
balcony
and
very
often
log
churches
were
built
for
them
meetings
were
held
under
bush
harbors
after
the
war
frame
and
log
churches
served
them
as
places
of
worship
these
buildings
were
erected
by
whites
who
came
into
the
southland
to
help
the
negro
men
who
claimed
god
had
called
them
to
preach
served
as
ministers
of
most
of
the
negro
churches
but
often
white
preachers
visited
them
and
instructed
them
concerning
the
bible
and
what
god
wanted
them
to
do
services
were
conducted
three
times
a
day
on
sunday
morning
at
eleven
in
afternoon
about
three
and
at
night
at
eight
the
manner
of
worship
was
very
much
in
keeping
with
present
day
modes
preachers
appealed
to
the
emotions
of
the
and
the
congregation
responded
with
amens
halleluia
clapping
of
hands
shouting
and
screaming
willis
remarked
to
one
white
man
during
his
early
life
that
he
wondered
why
the
people
yelled
so
loudly
and
the
man
replied
that
in
fifty
years
hence
the
negroes
would
be
educated
know
better
and
would
not
do
that
he
further
replied
that
fifty
years
ago
the
white
people
screamed
and
shouted
that
way
willis
wonders
now
when
he
sees
both
white
and
colored
people
responding
to
preaching
in
much
the
same
way
as
in
his
early
life
if
education
has
made
much
difference
in
many
cases
much
superstition
and
ignorance
existed
among
the
negroes
during
slavery
and
early
reconstruction
some
wore
bags
of
sulphur
saying
they
would
keep
away
disease
some
wore
bags
of
salt
and
charcoal
believing
that
evil
spirits
would
be
kept
away
from
them
others
wore
a
silver
coin
in
their
shoes
and
some
made
holes
in
the
coin
threaded
a
string
through
it
attached
it
to
the
ankle
so
that
no
one
could
conjure
them
some
who
thought
an
enemy
might
sprinkle
goofer
dust
around
their
door
steps
swept
very
clean
around
the
door
step
in
the
evening
and
allowed
no
one
to
come
in
afterwards
the
negro
men
who
spent
much
time
around
the
grannies
during
slavery
learned
much
about
herbs
and
roots
and
how
they
were
used
to
cure
all
manner
of
ills
the
doctor
gave
practically
the
same
kind
of
medicine
for
most
ailments
the
white
doctors
at
that
time
had
not
been
schooled
to
a
great
extent
and
carried
medicine
bags
around
to
the
sick
room
which
contained
pills
and
a
very
few
other
kinds
of
medicines
which
they
had
made
from
herbs
and
roots
some
of
them
are
used
but
willis
said
most
of
their
medicines
were
pills
ten
years
after
the
civil
war
willis
williams
had
advanced
in
his
studies
to
the
extent
that
he
passed
the
government
examination
and
became
a
railway
mail
clerk
he
ran
from
tallahassee
to
palatka
and
river
junction
on
the
florida
central
and
peninsular
railroad
there
was
no
other
railroad
going
into
tallahassee
then
the
first
negro
railway
mail
clerk
according
to
willis
knowledge
running
from
tallahassee
to
jacksonville
was
benjamin
cox
the
first
colored
mail
clerk
in
the
jacksonville
post
office
was
camp
hughes
he
was
sent
to
prison
for
rifling
the
mail
willis
myers
succeeded
hughes
and
willis
williams
succeeded
myers
willis
received
a
telegram
to
come
to
jacksonville
to
take
myers
place
and
when
he
came
expected
to
stay
three
or
four
days
but
after
getting
here
was
retained
permanently
and
remained
in
the
service
until
his
retirement
his
first
run
from
tallahassee
to
palatka
and
river
junction
began
in
and
lasted
until
in
he
was
called
to
jacksonville
to
succeed
myers
and
when
he
retired
forty
years
later
had
filled
the
position
creditably
therefore
was
retired
on
a
pension
which
he
will
receive
until

death

born
a

claude
augusta
wilson
of

his

tom

was
very
kind
to
his

and
was
said
to
have
been

his

she
was
very

claude
was
eight
years
old
when
emancipation
came
the
dexter
plantation
was
quite
a
large
place
covering
or
more
acres
there
were
about
slaves
including
children
they
had
regular
one
room
quarters
built
of
logs
which
was
quite
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
palatial
dexter
mansion
the
slaves
would
arise
early
each
morning
being
awakened
by
a
driver
who
was
a
white
man
and
by
would
be
at
their
respective
tasks
in
the
fields
all
day
they
worked
stopping
at
noon
to
get
a
bite
to
eat
which
they
carried
on
the
fields
from
their
cabins
at
they
would
quit
work
and
return
to
their
cabins
prepare
their
meals
and
gossip
from
cabin
to
cabin
finally
retiring
to
await
the
dawn
of
a
new
day
which
signalled
a
return
to
their
routine
duties
at
sundays
they
would
gather
at
a
poorly
constructed
frame
building
which
was
known
as
the
meeting
house
in
this
building
they
would
give
praise
and
thanks
to
their
god
the
rest
of
the
day
was
spent
in
relaxation
as
this
was
the
only
day
of
the
week
in
which
they
were
not
forced
to
work
claude
augusta
worked
in
the
fields
his
mother
and
sister
worked
in
the
dexter
mansion
their
duties
were
general
house
work
cooking
and
sewing
his
mother
was
very
rebellious
toward
her
duties
and
constantly
harrassed
the
missus
about
letting
her
work
in
the
fields
with
her
husband
until
finally
she
was
permitted
to
make
the
change
from
the
house
to
the
fields
to
be
near
her
man
the
missus
taught
claude
sister
to
sew
and
to
the
present
day
most
of
her
female
descendants
have
some
ability
in
dress
making
the
mansion
was
furnished
with
the
latest
furniture
of
the
tine
but
the
slave
quarters
had
only
the
cheapest
and
barest
necessities
his
mother
had
no
stove
but
cooked
in
the
fire
place
using
a
skillet
and
spider
skillet
a
small
metal
vessel
with
handle
used
for
cooking
spider
a
kind
of
frying
pan
winston
simplified
dictionary
the
cooking
was
not
done
directly
on
the
coals
in
the
fire
place
but
placed
on
the
hearth
and
hot
coals
pulled
around
them
more
coals
being
pulled
about
until
the
food
was
cooked
as
desired
corn
bread
beans
sweet
potatoes
irish
potatoes
being
unknown
and
collard
greens
were
the
principal
foods
eaten
corn
bread
was
made
as
it
is
today
only
cooked
differently
the
corn
meal
after
being
mixed
was
wrapped
in
tannion
leaves
elephant
ears
and
placed
in
hot
coals
the
leaves
would
parch
to
a
crisp
and
when
the
bread
was
removed
it
was
a
beautiful
brown
and
unburned
sweet
potatoes
were
roasted
in
the
hot
coals
corn
was
often
roasted
in
the
shucks
there
was
a
substitute
for
coffee
that
afforded
a
striking
similarity
in
taste
the
husks
of
the
grains
of
corn
were
parched
hot
water
was
then
poured
in
this
the
result
was
a
pleasant
liquid
substitute
for
coffee
these
was
another
bread
used
as
a
desert
known
as
potato
bread
made
by
tailing
potatoes
until
done
then
mashing
adding
grease
and
meal
this
was
baked
and
then
it
was
ready
to
serve
for
lights
candles
were
made
of
tallow
which
was
poured
into
a
mould
when
hot
a
cord
was
run
through
the
center
of
the
candle
impression
in
the
mould
in
which
the
tallow
was
poured
when
this
cooled
the
candle
with
cord
was
all
ready
for
lighting
the
only
means
of
obtaining
water
was
from
an
open
well
no
ice
was
used
the
first
ice
that
claude
ever
saw
in
its
regular
form
was
in
jacksonville
after
emancipation
this
ice
was
naturally
frozen
and
shipped
from
the
north
to
be
sold
it
was
called
lake
ice
tanning
and
curing
pig
and
cow
hides
was
done
but
claude
never
saw
the
process
performed
during
slavery
claude
had
no
special
duties
on
the
plantation
on
account
of
his
youth
after
cotton
was
picked
from
the
fields
the
seeds
were
picked
out
by
hand
the
cotton
was
then
carded
for
further
use
the
cotton
seed
was
used
as
fertilizer
in
baling
cotton
burlap
bags
were
used
on
the
bales
the
soap
used
was
made
from
taking
hickory
or
oak
wood
and
burning
it
to
ashes
the
ashes
were
placed
in
a
tub
and
water
poured
over
them
this
was
left
to
set
after
setting
for
a
certain
time
the
water
from
the
ashes
was
poured
into
a
pot
containing
grease
this
was
boiled
for
a
certain
time
and
then
left
to
cool
the
result
was
a
pot
full
of
soft
substance
varying
in
color
from
white
to
yellow
this
was
called
lye
soap
this
was
then
cut
into

for
dyeing
thread
and
cloth
red
oak

sweet
gum
bark
and
shoe

claude
remembers
when
women
wore
hoop
skirts
he
was
about
years
of
age
when
narrow
skirts
became
fashionable
for
women
during
slavery
the
family
only
used
slats
on
the
beds
it
was
after
the
war
that
he
saw
his
first
spring
bed
and
at
that
tine
the
first
buggy
this
buggy
was
driven
by
reid
of
florida
who
then
lived
in
south
jacksonville
it
was
a
affair
drawn
by
a
horse
and
looked
sensible
and
natural
as
a
vehicle
the
paper
money
in
circulation
was
called
shin
plasters
uncle
mark
clark
joined
the
northern
army
his
master
did
not
go
to
war
but
remained
on
the
plantation
one
day
at
noon
during
the
war
the
gin
house
was
seen
to
be
afire
one
of
the
slaves
rushed
in
and
found
the
master
badly
burned
and
writhing
in
pain
he
was
taken
from
the
building
and
given
first
aid
but
his
body
being
burned
in
oil
and
so
badly
burned
it
burst
open
thus
ended
the
life
of
the
kindly
master
of
claude
the
soldiers
of
the
southern
army
wore
gray
uniforms
with
gray
caps
and
the
soldiers
of
the
northern
army
wore
blue
after
the
war
such
medicines
as
castor
oil
rhubarb
colomel
and
blue
mass
and
salts
were
generally
used
the
civil
war
raged
for
some
tine
and
the
slaves
on
dexter
plantation
prayed
for
victory
of
the
northern
army
though
they
dared
not
show
their
anxiety
to
mary
ann
dexter
who
was
master
and
mistress
since
the
master
death
claude
and
his
family
remained
with
the
dexters
until
peace
was
declared
dexter
informed
the
slaves
thay
they
could
stay
with
her
if
they
so
desired
and
that
she
would
furnish
everything
to
cultivate
the
crops
and
that
she
would
give
them
half
of
what
was
raised
none
of
the
slaves
remained
but
all
were
anxious
to
see
what
freedom
was
like
claude
recalls
that
a
team
drove
up
to
the
house
driven
by
a
colored
union
soldier
he
helped
move
the
household
furniture
from
their
cabin
into
the
wagon
the
family
then
got
in
some
in
the
seat
with
the
driver
and
others
in
back
of
the
wagon
with
the
furniture
when
the
driver
pulled
off
he
said
to
claude
mother
who
was
sitting
on
the
seat
with
him
doan

she

he
answered
and
drove
off
they
passed
through
olustee
then
sanderson
macclenny
and
finally
baldwin
it
was
raining
and
they
were
about
miles
from
their
destination
jacksonville
but
they
drove
on
they
reached
jacksonville
and
were
taken
to
a
house
that
stood
on
liberty
street
near
adams
white
people
had
been
living
there
but
had
left
before
the
northern
advance
there
they
unloaded
and
were
told
that
this
would
be
their
new
home
the
town
was
full
of
colored
soldiers
all
armed
with
muskets
horns
and
drums
could
be
heard
beating
and
blowing
every
morning
and
evening
the
colored
soldiers
appeared
to
rule
the
town
more
slaves
were
brought
in
and
there
they
were
given
food
by
the
government
which
consisted
of
hard
tack
bread
reddish
in
appearance
and
extremely
hard
which
had
to
be
soaked
in
water
before
eating
the
meat
was
known
as
salt
horse
this
looked
and
tasted
somewhat
like
corned
beef
after
being
in
jacksonville
a
short
while
claude
began
to
peddle
ginger
bread
and
apples
in
a
little
basket
selling
most
of
his
wares
to
the
colored
soldiers
his
father
got
employment
with
a
railroad
company
in
jacksonville
known
as
the
florida
central
railway
and
received
a
day
which
was
considered
very
good
pay
his
mother
got
a
job
with
a
family
as
house
woman
at
a
salary
of
eight
dollars
a
month
they
were
thus
considered
getting
along
fine
they
remained
in
the
house
where
the
government
placed
them
for
about
a
year
then
his
father
bought
a
piece
of
land
in
town
and
built
a
house
of
straight
boards
there
they
resided
until
his
death
by
this
time
many
of
the
white
people
began
to
return
to
their
homes
which
had
been
abandoned
and
in
which
slaves
found
shelter
in
many
instances
the
whites
had
to
make
monetary
or
other
concessions
in
order
to
get
their
homes
back
it
was
said
that
colored
people
had
taken
possession
of
one
of
the
large
white
churches
of
the
day
located
on
logon
street
between
ashley

there
were
clean

on
the
floor
where
the
salt
and
grease
drippings
would
fall
from

hams
hanging
from

be
soft
and
soaked
with
salt

cooked
the
salt
and

the
following
portion
of
this
interview
is
a
near
repeat
of
a
portion
of
an
earlier
interview
with
this
informant
however
it
is
included
here
because
the
transcription
varies
i
well
when
the
war
was
on
i
used
to
turn
the
corn
sheller
and
sack
the
shelled
corn
for
the
confederate
soldiers
they
used
to
sell
some
of
the
corn
and
i
guess
they
gave
some
of
it
to
the
soldiers
anyway
the
yankees
got
some
that
they
did
intend
them
to
get
it
was
this
way
the
wheeler
boys
were
confederates
they
came
down
the
road
as
happy
as
could
be
hur
rah
hurrah
hurrah
for
the
broke
brook
boys
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
for
the
broke
brook
boys
of
south
so
of
course
we
thought
they
were
our
soldiers
singin
our
songs
well
they
came
and
tol
our
boss
that
the
yankees
were
coming
and
we
had
better
hide
our
food
and
valuable
things
for
they
take
everything
they
wanted
so
they
helped
our
massy
hide
the
things
they
dug
holes
and
buried
the
potatoes
and
covered
them
over
with
cotton
seed
then
our
massy
gave
them
food
for
their
kindness
and
set
out
with
two
of
the
girls
to
take
them
to
a
place
of
safety
and
before
he
could
come
back
for
the
missus
the
yankees
were
upon
us
but
before
they
got
there
our
missus
had
called
us
together
and
told
us
what
to
say

worked
in
the
house
so
i
did
tell
a
lie
for
i

we
saw
the
yankees
coming
they
never
stopped
for
nothing
their
horses
would
jump
the
worn
rail
fences
and
they
come
right
across
the
an
everything
they
came
to
the
house
first
and
bound
our
missus
up
stairs
so
she
could
get
away
then
they
came
out
to
the
sheds
and
asked
us
all
kind
of
questions
we
begged
for
our
missus
