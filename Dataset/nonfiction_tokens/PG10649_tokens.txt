publishers
preface
in
preparing
the
new
edition
of
lord
great
work
it
has
been
thought
desirable
to
do
what
the
venerable
author
death
in
did
not
permit
him
to
accomplish
and
add
a
volume
summarizing
certain
broad
aspects
of
achievement
in
the
last
fifty
years
it
were
manifestly
impossible
to
cover
in
any
single
volume
except
in
the
dry
cyclopaedic
style
of
chronicling
multitudinous
facts
so
different
from
the
vivid
personal
method
of
lord
all
the
growths
of
the
wonderful
period
just
closed
the
only
practicable
way
has
been
to
follow
our
principle
of
portraying
historic
to
take
as
representative
or
typical
of
the
various
departments
certain
great
characters
whose
services
have
signalized
them
as
beacon
lights
along
the
path
of
progress
and
to
secure
adequate
portrayal
of
these
by
men
known
to
be
competent
for
interesting
exposition
of
the
several
themes
thus
the
volume
opens
with
a
paper

richard

the
selection
of
themes
must
be
arbitrary
amid
the
numberless
lines
of
development
during
the
new
era
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
which
every
mental
moral
and
physical
science
and
art
has
grown
and
diversified
and
fructified
with
a
rapidity
seen
in
no
other
five
centuries
it
is
hoped
however
that
the
choice
will
be
justified
by
the
interest
of
the
separate
papers
and
that
their
result
will
be
such
a
view
of
the
main
features
as
to
leave
a
distinct
impression
of
the
general
life
and
advancement
especially
of
the
last
half
of
the
century
it
is
proper
to
say
that
the
preparation

were

modern
music
by
henry
finck
if
the
dresden
schoolboys
who
attended
the
in
the
years
could
have
been
told
that
one
of
them
was
destined
to
be
the
greatest
opera
composer
of
all
times
and
to
influence
the
musicians
of
all
countries
throughout
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
would
no
doubt
have
been
very
much
surprised
nor
is
it
likely
that
they
could
have
guessed
which
of
them
was
the
chosen
one
for
richard
wagner
or
richard
geyer
as
he
was
then
called
after
his
stepfather
was
by
no
means
a
youthful
prodigy
like
mozart
or
liszt
it
is
related
that
beethoven
shed
tears
of
displeasure
over
his
first
music
lessons
nevertheless
it
was
obvious
from
the
beginning
that
he
had
a
special
gift
for
music
richard
wagner
on
the
other
hand
apparently
had
none
when
he
was
eight
years
old
his
stepfather
shortly
before
his
death
heard
him
play
on
the
piano
two
pieces
from
one
of
operas
which
made
him
wonder
if
richard
might
perhaps
have
talent
for
music
his
piano
teacher
did
not
believe
even
in
that
perhaps
but
told
him
bluntly
he
would
never
amount
to
anything
as
a
musician
for
poetry
however
young
richard
had
a
decided
inclination
in
his
school
years
and
this
was
significant
inasmuch
as
it
afterwards
became
his
cardinal
maxim
that
in
an
opera
the
play
the
thing
and
the
music
merely
a
means
of
intensifying
the
emotional
expression
before
his
time
the
music
or
rather
the
singing
of
florid
tunes
had
been
the
thing
and
the
libretto
merely
a
peg
to
hang
these
tunes
on
in
this
respect
therefore
the
child
was
father
to
the
man
at
the
age
of
eleven
he
received
a
prize
for
the
best
poem
on
the
death
of
a
schoolmate
at
thirteen
he
translated
the
first
twelve
books
of
odyssey
he
studied
english
for
the
sole
purpose
of
being
able
to
read
shakspeare
then
he
projected
a
stupendous
tragedy
in
the
course
of
which
he
killed
off
persons
many
of
whom
had
to
be
brought
back
as
ghosts
to
enable
him
to
finish
the
play
this
extravagance
also
characterized
his
first
efforts
as
a
composer
when
he
at
last
turned
to
music
at
the
age
of
sixteen
one
of
his
first
tasks
when
he
had
barely
mastered
the
rudiments
of
composition
was
to
write
an
overture
which
he
intended
to
be
more
complicated
than
beethoven
ninth
symphony
heinrich
dorn
who
recognized
his
talent
amid
all
the
bombast
conducted
this
piece
at
a
concert
at
the
rehearsal
the
musicians
were
convulsed
with
laughter
and
at
the
performance
the
audience
was
at
first
surprised
and
then
disgusted
at
the
persistence
of
the
who
made
himself
heard
loudly
every
fourth
bar
finally
there
was
a
general
outburst
of
hilarity
which
taught
the
young
man
a
needed
lesson
undoubtedly
the
germs
of
his
musical
genius
had
been
in
wagner
brain
in
his
childhood
for
genius
is
not
a
thing
that
can
be
acquired
they
had
simply
lain
dormant
and
it
required
a
special
influence
to
develop
them
this
influence
was
supplied
by
weber
and
his
operas
in
two
years
after
wagner
birth
the
king
of
saxony
founded
a
german
opera
in
dresden
where
theretofore
italian
opera
had
ruled
alone
weber
was
chosen
as
conductor
and
thus
it
happened
that
wagner
earliest
and
deepest
impressions
came
from
the
composer
of
the
freischütz
in
his
autobiographic
sketch
wagner
writes
nothing
gave
me
so
much
pleasure
as
the
i
often
saw
weber
pass
by
our
house
when
he
came
from
rehearsals
i
always
looked
upon
him
with
a
holy
awe
it
was
lucky
for
young
richard
that
his
stepfather
geyer
besides
being
a
an
actor
and
a
playwright
was
also
one
of
tenors
at
the
opera
this
enabled
the
boy
in
spite
of
the
poverty
to
hear
many
of
the
performances
in
fact
wagner
like
weber
owes
a
considerable
part
of
his
success
as
a
writer
for
the
stage
to
the
fact
that
he
belonged
to
a
theatrical
family
and
thus
gradually
learned
how
the
wheels
go
round
such
practical
experience
is
worth
more
than
years
of
academic
study
while
wagner
cordially
acknowledged
the
fascination
which
weber
music
exerted
on
him
in
his
boyhood
he
was
hardly
fair
to
weber
in
his
later
writings
in
these
he
tries
to
prove
that
his
own
are
an
outgrowth
of
beethoven
ninth
symphony
when
beethoven
wrote
that
work
wagner
argues
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
purely
instrumental
music
had
reached
a
point
beyond
which
it
could
not
go
alone
wherefore
he
called
in
the
aid
of
poetry
sung
by
soloists
and
chorus
and
thus
intimated
that
the
of
the
future
was
the
musical
drama
a
combination
of
poetry
and
music
this
is
a
purely
fantastic
notion
on
wagner
part
there
is
no
evidence
that
beethoven
had
any
such
purpose
he
merely
called
in
the
aid
of
the
human
voice
to
secure
variety
of
sound
and
expression
poetry
and
music
had
been
combined
centuries
before
beethoven
in
the
opera
and
in
lyric
song
no
the
roots
of
wagner
are
not
to
be
found
in
beethoven
but
in
weber
his
freischütz
and
euryanthe
are
the
prototypes
of
wagner
operas
the
freischütz
is
the
first
masterwork
as
operas
are
the
last
up
to
date
of
the
romantic
school
and
it
embodies
admirably
two
of
the
principal
characteristics
of
that
school
one
a
delight
in
the
demoniac
the
supernatural
what
the
germans
call
the
other
the
use
of
certain
instruments
alone
or
in
combination
for
the
sake
of
securing
peculiar
emotional
effects
in
both
these
respects
wagner
followed
in
weber
footsteps
with
the
exception
of
rienzi
and
die
meistersinger
all
of
his
operas
from
the
flying
dutchman
to
parsifal
embody
supernatural
mythical
romantic
elements
and
in
the
use
of
novel
tone
colors
for
special
emotional
effects
he
opened
a
new
of
sound
to
which
weber
however
had
given
him
the
key
lohengrin
the
last
one
of
what
are
usually
called
wagner
operas
as
distinguished
from
his
comprising
the
last
seven
of
his
works
betrays
very
strongly
the
influence
of
weber
other
masterwork
euryanthe
this
opera
indeed
may
also
be
called
the
direct
precursor
of
wagner
it
contains
eight
leading
motives
which
recur
thirty
times
in
course
of
the
opera
and
the
dramatic
recitatives
are
sometimes
quite
in
the
wagnerian
manner
but
the
most
remarkable
thing
is
that
weber
uses
language
which
practically
sums
up
wagner
idea
of
the
he
says
is
a
purely
dramatic
work
which
depends
for
its
success
solely
on
the
of
the
united
and
is
certain
to
lose
its
effect
if
deprived
of
their
assistance
when
wagner
wrote
his
essay
on
the
music
of
the
future
for
the
parisians
he
remembered
his
obligations
to
the
dresden
idol
of
his
boyhood
by
calling
attention
to
the
still
very
noticeable
connection
of
his
early
work
tannhäuser
with
the
operas
of
my
predecessors
among
whom
i
name
especially
weber
he
might
have
mentioned
others
gluck
for
instance
who
curbed
the
vanity
of
the
singers
and
taught
them
that
they
were
not
the
whole
show
marschner
whose
grewsome
hans
heiling
wagner
had
in
mind
when
he
wrote
his
flying
dutchman
auber
whose
masaniello
with
its
dumb
heroine
taught
wagner
the
importance
and
expressiveness
of
pantomimic
music
of
which
there
are
such
eloquent
examples
in
all
his
operas
during
his
three
and
a
half
years
sojourn
in
paris
just
at
the
opening
of
his
career
as
an
opera
composer
he
learned
many
things
regarding
operatic
scenery
machinery
processions
and
details
which
he
subsequently
turned
to
good
account
even
meyerbeer
the
ruler
of
the
musical
world
in
paris
at
that
time
was
not
without
influence
on
him
though
he
had
cause
to
disapprove
of
him
because
of
his
submission
to
the
demands
of
the
fashionable
taste
of
the
day
which
contrasted
so
strongly
with
wagner
own
courageous
defiance
of
everything
inconsistent
with
his
ideals
of
art
the
result
meyerbeer
fall
and
wagner
triumph
shows
that
courage
like
honesty
is
in
the
long
run
the
best
policy
and
like
virtue
its
own
reward
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
all
these
lessons
that
wagner
learned
from
his
predecessors
as
it
helps
to
explain
the
enormous
influence
he
exerted
on
his
contemporaries
wonderful
as
was
the
power
and
originality
of
his
genius
even
he
could
not
have
achieved
such
results
had
he
not
had
truth
on
his
side
truth
as
hinted
at
in
moments
of
inspiration
by
many
of
his
predecessors
wagner
was
most
shamefully
misrepresented
by
his
enemies
during
his
lifetime
a
thousand
times
they
wrote
unblushingly
that
he
despised
and
abused
the
great
masters
whereas
in
truth
no
one
ever
spoke
of
them
more
enthusiastically
than
he
or
was
more
eager
to
learn
of
them
though
to
be
sure
he
was
honest
and
courageous
enough
also
to
call
attention
to
their
shortcomings
in
all
his
autobiographic
writings
there
is
not
a
more
luminous
passage
than
the
following
in
which
he
relates
his
experiences
as
conductor
at
the
riga
opera
in
when
he
was
at
work
on
rienzi
the
peculiar
gnawing
melancholy
which
habitually
overpowered
me
when
i
conducted
one
of
our
ordinary
operas
was
interrupted
by
an
inexpressible
enthusiastic
delight
when
here
and
there
during
the
performance
of
nobler
works
i
became
conscious
of
the
incomparable
effects
that
can
be
produced
by
combinations
on
the
stage
effects
of
a
depth
sincerity
and
direct
realistic
vivacity
such
as
no
other
art
can
produce
i
felt
quite
elated
and
ennobled
during
the
time
that
i
was
rehearsing
méhul
enchanting
with
my
little
opera
company
such
impressions
he
continues
like
flashes
of
lightning
revealed
to
him
unsuspected
possibilities
it
was
by
utilizing
these
possibilities
and
hints
and
at
the
same
time
avoiding
the
errors
and
blemishes
of
his
predecessors
that
his
superlative
genius
was
enabled
to
create
such
unapproachable
masterworks
as
siegfried
and
tristan
and
isolde
the
way
up
to
those
peaks
was
however
slow
and
toilsome
for
years
he
groped
in
darkness
and
light
came
but
gradually
it
has
already
been
intimated
that
his
genius
was
slow
in
developing
a
brief
review
of
his
romantic
career
will
bring
out
this
and
other
interesting
points
at
the
time
when
richard
wagner
was
born
may
leipzig
was
in
such
a
state
of
commotion
on
account
of
the
war
to
liberate
germany
from
the
napoleonic
yoke
that
the
child
baptism
was
deferred
several
months
to
his
schooldays
reference
has
been
made
already
and
we
may
therefore
pass
on
to
the
time
when
he
tried
to
make
his
living
as
an
operatic
conductor
although
he
was
then
only
years
old
he
showed
remarkable
aptitude
for
this
kind
of
work
from
the
beginning
and
it
was
through
no
fault
of
his
that
misfortune
overtook
every
opera
company
with
which
he
had
anything
to
do
the
bankruptcy
in
of
the
manager
of
the
magdeburg
opera
affected
him
most
disastrously
for
it
came
at
the
moment
when
he
had
arranged
for
the
first
performance
of
an
opera
he
had
written
entitled
das
liebesverbot
or
the
novice
of
palermo
and
which
therefore
was
given
only
once
many
years
later
an
attempt
was
made
to
revive
this
juvenile
work
at
munich
but
the
project
was
abandoned
because
as
the
famous
wagnerian
tenor
heinrich
vogl
informed
the
writer
of
this
article
its
arias
and
other
numbers
were
such
ludicrous
and
undisguised
imitations
of
donizetti
and
other
popular
composers
of
that
time
that
we
all
burst
out
laughing
and
kept
up
the
merriment
throughout
the
rehearsal
this
is
of
interest
because
it
shows
that
wagner
like
that
other
great
reformer
gluck
began
his
career
by
writing
fashionable
operas
in
the
italian
style
a
still
earlier
opera
of
his
the
fairies
the
first
one
he
completed
was
not
produced
till
years
after
it
had
been
written
and
five
years
after
wagner
death
this
has
been
performed
a
number
of
times
in
munich
but
it
is
so
weak
and
uninteresting
in
itself
that
it
required
a
splendid
stage
setting
and
the
historic
curiosity
of
wagner
admirers
to
make
it
palatable
it
is
significant
that
already
in
these
early
works
wagner
wrote
his
own
librettos
a
policy
which
he
pursued
to
the
end
königsberg
was
the
next
city
where
the
opera
company
with
which
he
was
connected
failed
this
was
the
more
embarrassing
to
him
as
he
had
in
the
meantime
been
so
unwise
as
to
marry
a
pretty
actress
minna
planer
who
was
destined
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
to
faithfully
share
his
experiences
chiefly
disappointments
the
pittance
he
got
as
conductor
of
these
small
german
opera
companies
did
not
pay
his
expenses
all
the
less
as
he
was
fond
of
luxurious
living
and
like
most
artists
the
world
over
foolishly
squandered
his
money
when
he
happened
to
have
any
at
riga
where
wagner
next
attempted
to
establish
himself
the
opera
company
again
got
into
trouble
and
his
financial
straits
became
such
that
relying
on
his
future
ability
to
meet
his
obligations
he
resolved
to
leave
that
part
of
the
world
altogether
and
seek
his
fortune
in
paris
he
knew
that
the
prussian
meyerbeer
had
won
fame
and
fortune
there
why
should
not
he
have
the
same
good
luck
he
had
unbounded
confidence
in
his
own
ability
and
what
increased
his
hopes
of
a
parisian
success
was
that
he
had
already
completed
two
acts
of
a
grand
historic
opera
rienzi
based
on
bulwer
novel
and
written
in
the
sensational
and
spectacular
style
of
meyerbeer
he
supposed
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
go
to
paris
finish
this
opera
get
it
accepted
through
the
influence
of
his
countryman
and
colleague
meyerbeer
and
wake
up
some
morning
famous
and
wealthy
he
was
not
the
first
man
who
built
castles
in
spain
a
trip
from
riga
to
paris
is
a
very
simple
affair
you
get
into
a
train
and
in
about
hours
are
at
your
goal
in
there
were
no
such
conveniences
wagner
had
to
go
to
the
prussian
seaport
of
pillau
and
there
board
a
sailing
vessel
which
took
him
to
london
in
three
weeks
and
a
half
his
journey
however
was
a
much
more
romantic
affair
than
a
railway
trip
would
have
been
in
the
first
place
it
was
a
real
flight
from
his
creditors
whom
he
had
to
evade
next
he
had
to
dodge
the
russian
sentries
whose
boxes
were
placed
on
the
boundary
line
only
a
thousand
yards
apart
a
friend
discovered
a
way
of
accomplishing
this
feat
and
wagner
presently
found
himself
on
the
ship
with
his
wife
and
his
enormous
newfoundland
dog
in
his
trunk
he
had
what
he
hoped
would
help
him
to
begin
a
brilliant
career
in
paris
one
opera
completed
the
novice
of
palermo
two
acts
of
another
rienzi
and
in
his
head
he
had
the
plot
and
some
of
the
musical
themes
for
a
third
the
flying
dutchman
the
sea
voyage
came
just
in
time
to
give
him
local
color
for
this
weird
nautical
opera
three
times
the
vessel
was
tossed
by
violent
storms
and
once
the
captain
was
obliged
to
seek
safety
in
a
norwegian
harbor
the
sailors
told
wagner
their
version
of
the
flying
dutchman
legend
and
altogether
these
adventures
were
the
very
thing
he
wanted
at
the
time
and
aided
him
in
making
his
opera
realistic
both
in
its
text
and
its
music
which
imitates
the
howling
of
the
storm
winds
and
smells
of
the
salt
breezes
so
for
once
our
young
musician
had
a
streak
of
luck
but
it
did
not
last
long
he
found
paris
a
very
large
city
and
with
very
little
use
for
him
he
made
the
most
diverse
efforts
to
support
himself
nearly
always
without
success
once
it
seemed
as
if
his
hopes
were
to
be
fulfilled
the
théâtre
de
la
renaissance
accepted
his
novice
of
palermo
but
at
the
last
moment
there
was
the
usual
bankruptcy
of
the
management
the
fourth
that
affected
him
then
he
wrote
a
parisian
vaudeville
but
it
had
to
be
given
up
because
the
actors
declared
it
could
not
be
executed
the
grand
opera
on
which
he
had
fixed
his
eye
was
absolutely
out
of
the
question
he
was
brought
to
such
straits
that
he
offered
to
sing
in
the
chorus
of
a
small
boulevard
theatre
but
was
rejected
his
wife
pawned
her
jewels
on
several
occasions
it
is
said
that
she
even
went
into
the
street
to
beg
a
few
pennies
for
their
supper
it
was
doubtless
during
these
years
of
starvation
that
wagner
acquired
those
gastric
troubles
which
in
later
years
often
prevented
him
from
working
more
than
an
hour
or
two
a
day
a
few
german
friends
occasionally
gave
a
little
pecuniary
aid
but
the
only
regular
source
of
income
was
musical
hackwork
for
the
publisher
schlesinger
who
gladly
availed
himself
of
wagner
skill
in
having
him
make
vocal
scores
of
operas
or
arrange
popular
melodies
for
the
piano
and
other
instruments
wagner
also
wrote
stories
and
essays
for
musical
periodicals
for
which
he
received
fair
remuneration
but
his
attempt
to
compose
romances
and
become
a
parlor
favorite
failed
nobody
wanted
his
songs
and
he
finally
offered
them
to
the
editor
of
a
periodical
in
germany
for
two
dollars
and
a
half
to
four
dollars
apiece
this
may
seem
ludicrously
pathetic
but
then
had
not
poor
schubert
a
little
more
than
a
decade
before
this
sold
much
better
songs
for
twenty
cents
each
meyerbeer
no
doubt
aided
wagner
but
considering
his
very
great
influence
in
paris
he
achieved
surprisingly
little
for
him
the
score
of
rienzi
had
been
completed
in
and
in
the
spring
of
the
next
year
wagner
went
to
meudon
near
paris
and
there
composed
the
music
of
the
flying
dutchman
in
seven
weeks
but
neither
of
these
operas
seemed
to
have
the
least
chance
to
appear
on
the
boards
of
the
grand
opera
the
best
their
author
could
do
was
to
sell
the
libretto
of
the
flying
dutchman
for
one
hundred
dollars
reserving
the
right
to
set
it
to
music
himself
the
outcome
of
all
these
disappointments
was
that
he
finally
lost
hope
so
far
as
paris
was
concerned
and
sent
his
rienzi
to
dresden
and
his
flying
dutchman
to
berlin
the
novice
of
palermo
he
had
given
up
entirely
after
the
bankruptcy
of
the
renaissance
théâtre
because
as
he
wrote
i
felt
that
i
could
no
longer
respect
myself
as
its
composer
meyerbeer
had
at
his
request
kindly
sent
a
note
to
the
intendant
of
the
dresden
opera
in
which
he
said
among
other
things
that
he
had
found
the
selections
from
rienzi
which
wagner
had
played
for
him
highly
imaginative
and
of
great
dramatic
effect
tichatschek
the
famous
dresden
tenor
examined
the
score
and
liked
the
title
role
the
chorus
director
fischer
also
pleaded
for
the
acceptance
of
the
opera
and
so
at
last
wagner
got
word
in
paris
that
it
would
be
produced
in
dresden
as
berlin
too
retained
the
manuscript
of
his
other
opera
there
was
reason
enough
for
him
to
end
his
parisian
sojourn
and
return
to
his
native
country
he
went
overland
this
time
and
to
cite
his
own
words
for
the
first
time
i
saw
the
rhine
with
tears
in
my
eyes
i
the
poor
artist
swore
eternal
allegiance
to
my
german
fatherland
it
was
fortunate
in
every
way
that
he
went
to
dresden
his
opera
required
many
alterations
and
improvements
which
he
alone
could
make
he
was
permitted
to
superintend
the
rehearsals
which
was
of
course
a
great
advantage
to
the
opera
the
singers
grew
more
and
more
enthusiastic
over
the
music
and
when
the
first
public
performance
was
given
on
october
the
audience
also
was
delighted
and
remained
to
the
very
end
although
the
performance
lasted
six
hours
the
composer
immediately
applied
the
and
reduced
the
duration
to
four
hours
and
a
half
from
to
opera
hours
were
early
in
those
days
but
the
tenor
tichatschek
declared
with
tears
in
his
eyes
i
shall
not
permit
any
cuts
in
my
part
it
is
too
heavenly
those
were
proud
and
happy
days
for
wagner
i
who
had
hitherto
been
lonely
deserted
homeless
he
wrote
suddenly
found
myself
loved
admired
by
many
even
regarded
with
wonderment
rienzi
was
repeated
a
number
of
times
to
overcrowded
houses
though
the
prices
had
been
put
up
it
was
regarded
as
a
fabulous
success
and
the
management
was
eager
to
follow
it
up
with
another
so
the
score
of
the
flying
dutchman
was
demanded
of
berlin
where
they
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
use
it
and
at
once
put
into
rehearsal
it
was
produced
in
dresden
on
january
only
about
ten
weeks
after
rienzi
an
almost
unprecedented
event
in
the
life
of
an
opera
composer
wagner
conducted
the
second
opera
himself
also
rienzi
after
the
first
few
performances
and
gave
so
much
satisfaction
that
he
was
shortly
afterwards
appointed
to
the
position
of
royal
conductor
which
he
held
about
six
years
so
far
all
seemed
well
but
disappointments
soon
began
to
overshadow
his
seeming
good
luck
the
first
production
of
the
flying
dutchman
can
hardly
be
called
a
success
wagner
himself
characterized
the
performance
as
being
in
its
main
features
a
complete
failure
and
the
stage
setting
incredibly
awkward
and
wooden
very
different
from
what
it
is
in
dresden
mme
was
an
admirable
senta
and
received
enthusiastic
applause
but
the
opera
itself
puzzled
the
audience
rather
than
pleased
it
the
of
dresden
had
expected
another
opera
meyerbeer
like
rienzi
with
its
arias
and
duos
its
din
and
its
dances
its
pomps
and
processions
its
scenic
and
musical
splendors
instead
of
that
they
heard
a
work
utterly
unlike
any
opera
ever
before
written
an
opera
without
arias
duets
and
dances
without
any
of
the
glitter
that
had
theretofore
entertained
the
public
an
opera
that
simply
related
a
legend
in
one
breath
as
it
were
like
a
dramatic
ballad
an
opera
that
indulged
in
weird
chromatic
scales
and
harsh
but
expressive
harmonies
with
an
unprecedented
license
here
was
the
real
wagner
but
even
in
this
early
and
comparatively
crude
and
simple
phase
wagner
was
too
novel
and
revolutionary
to
be
appreciated
by
his
contemporaries
hence
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
flying
dutchman
after
four
performances
in
dresden
and
a
few
in
cassel
and
berlin
disappeared
from
the
stage
for
ten
years
although
wagner
was
now
royal
conductor
he
did
not
succeed
in
securing
a
revival
of
this
opera
at
dresden
his
next
work
tannhäuser
was
nevertheless
promptly
accepted
the
score
was
completed
on
april
and
six
months
later
october
the
first
performance
was
given
wagner
had
thrown
himself
with
all
his
soul
into
the
composition
of
this
score
to
a
friend
in
berlin
he
wrote
this
opera
must
be
good
or
else
i
never
shall
be
able
to
do
anything
worth
while
the
public
at
first
seemed
to
agree
with
him
seven
performances
were
given
before
the
end
of
the
season
and
it
was
resumed
the
following
year
yet
wagner
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
written
the
opera
for
a
few
intimate
friends
but
not
for
the
public
to
cite
his
own
words
what
the
public
had
expected
and
desired
was
shown
by
its
enthusiastic
reception
of
rienzi
and
its
colder
treatment
of
the
dutchman
but
tannhäuser
was
like
the
second
opera
in
fact
even
more
so
wagner
had
outlived
the
time
when
he
was
willing
to
make
concessions
to
current
taste
and
fashion
thenceforth
he
went
his
own
way
eager
indeed
for
approval
but
stubbornly
refusing
to
win
it
by
sacrificing
his
high
art
ideals
here
was
true
heroism
genuine
manliness
had
he
been
willing
to
write
more
operas
like
rienzi
he
might
have
revelled
in
wealth
he
loved
wealth
and
basked
in
the
sunshine
of
popularity
like
meyerbeer
but
not
one
inch
of
concession
did
he
make
for
the
sake
of
the
riches
and
popular
favor
yet
was
not
his
next
work
lohengrin
of
a
popular
character
popular
yes
but
in
the
days
of
his
dresden
conductorship
he
could
not
even
get
it
accepted
for
performance
at
his
own
it
was
completed
in
august
the
last
act
having
been
written
first
and
the
second
last
but
although
he
remained
in
dresden
two
years
longer
all
his
efforts
to
get
it
staged
failed
for
various
reasons
and
when
at
last
liszt
gave
it
for
the
first
time
on
august
at
weimar
whence
it
gradually
made
its
way
to
other
its
reception
everywhere
showed
that
it
was
very
far
from
being
considered
a
popular
work
the
critics
especially
vied
with
one
another
in
abusing
this
same
lohengrin
which
at
present
is
sung
more
frequently
than
any
other
opera
and
they
continued
to
abuse
it
until
about
twenty
years
ago
an
abyss
of
ennui
void
of
all
melody
an
insult
to
the
very
essence
of
music
a
caricature
of
music
algebraic
harmonies
no
tangible
ideas
not
a
dozen
bars
of
melody
an
opera
without
music
an
incoherent
mass
of
rubbish
are
a
few
of
the
critical
opinions
passed
on
this
opera
which
is
now
regarded
in
all
countries
as
a
very
wonderland
of
beautiful
melodies
and
expressive
harmonies
the
in
dresden
of
this
glorious
opera
concerning
which
wagner
wrote
it
is
the
best
thing
i
have
done
so
far
was
only
one
of
many
trials
and
disappointments
which
daily
harassed
him
he
was
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
because
in
his
confidence
in
the
immediate
success
of
his
operas
he
had
had
them
printed
at
once
at
his
own
expense
the
were
very
slow
in
accepting
them
and
this
left
him
in
a
sad
predicament
there
were
moreover
enemies
everywhere
ignorant
professionals
who
objected
to
his
way
of
interpreting
the
masters
though
it
was
afterwards
admitted
that
he
was
as
an
interpreter
of
their
deepest
thoughts
all
this
galled
him
and
furthermore
no
attention
whatever
was
paid
to
his
pet
plans
for
reforming
the
dresden
opera
and
theatrical
matters
in
general
in
the
state
of
mind
brought
about
by
this
condition
of
affairs
it
needed
but
a
firebrand
to
start
an
explosion
this
firebrand
was
supplied
by
the
revolutionary
uprising
of
now
although
wagner
had
never
really
cared
much
for
politics
to
his
friend
fischer
he
once
wrote
i
do
not
consider
true
art
possible
until
politics
cease
to
exist
he
was
foolish
enough
to
believe
that
a
general
overturning
of
affairs
would
benefit
too
and
facilitate
his
operatic
reforms
so
he
became
as
he
himself
admits
a
revolutionist
in
behalf
of
the
theatre
he
actively
assisted
the
insurgents
and
the
consequence
was
that
when
the
rebellion
failed
he
had
to
leave
dresden
and
seek
safety
in
flight
three
of
the
leaders
of
the
insurrection
roeckel
bakunin
and
heubner
personal
friends
of
wagner
were
captured
and
imprisoned
he
himself
was
so
lucky
as
to
escape
to
weimar
where
franz
liszt
took
care
of
him
it
so
happened
that
liszt
who
had
given
up
his
career
as
concert
pianist
though
all
the
world
was
clamoring
to
hear
him
and
was
conducting
the
weimar
opera
had
been
preparing
a
performance
of
tannhäuser
to
which
wagner
would
under
normal
conditions
have
been
invited
as
a
matter
of
course
he
was
now
there
but
as
a
political
fugitive
wherefore
it
was
not
deemed
advisable
to
have
him
attend
the
public
performance
but
he
did
secretly
witness
a
rehearsal
and
was
delighted
to
find
that
genius
had
enabled
him
to
penetrate
into
the
innermost
recesses
of
this
music
it
was
impossible
however
for
him
to
stay
any
longer
the
dresden
police
had
issued
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
the
royal
kapellmeister
richard
wagner
who
was
to
be
placed
on
trial
for
active
participation
in
the
riots
which
have
taken
place
here
no
time
was
therefore
to
be
lost
late
in
the
evening
of
may
liszt
noble
patroness
the
princess
wittgenstein
received
this
note
from
him
can
you
give
the
bearer
sixty
thalers
wagner
is
obliged
to
fly
and
i
can
not
help
him
at
this
moment
early
the
next
morning
wagner
provided
with
a
false
pass
left
weimar
and
headed
for
switzerland
which
was
to
be
his
home
for
the
greater
part
of
the
following
twelve
years
of
his
exile
from
germany
had
he
been
caught
like
his
friends
and
like
them
imprisoned
during
these
years
it
is
not
likely
that
the
world
would
now
possess
those
seven
monuments
of
his
ripest
genius
rheingold
die
walküre
siegfried
götterdämmerung
tristan
and
isolde
die
meistersinger
and
parsifal
even
as
it
was
the
world
has
undoubtedly
lost
an
immortal
opera
or
two
through
his
unfortunate
participation
in
the
rebellion
for
during
the
first
four
years
of
his
exile
he
did
not
compose
any
music
he
reasoned
that
he
had
written
four
good
operas
and
nobody
seemed
to
want
them
why
therefore
should
he
compose
any
more
at
the
same
time
he
realized
that
there
were
natural
reasons
why
his
operas
were
not
understood
they
were
written
in
such
a
novel
style
both
vocal
and
instrumental
that
the
singers
players
and
conductors
found
it
difficult
to
perform
them
correctly
the
consequence
being
that
they
did
not
specially
impress
the
audiences
which
moreover
were
bewildered
by
finding
themselves
listening
to
works
so
radically
different
from
what
they
had
been
accustomed
to
in
the
in
the
hope
of
remedying
this
state
of
affairs
wagner
devoted
several
years
to
writing
essays
in
which
he
explained
his
aims
and
ideals
for
the
benefit
both
of
performers
and
listeners
little
attention
was
however
paid
to
these
essays
and
although
they
are
valuable
aesthetic
treatises
most
lovers
of
wagner
would
gladly
give
them
for
the
operas
he
might
have
written
in
the
same
time
operas
uniting
the
characteristics
of
lohengrin
and
the
valkyrie
wagner
letters
to
liszt
and
other
friends
show
that
he
suffered
tortures
and
was
often
brought
to
the
verge
of
suicide
by
the
thought
that
as
a
political
refugee
he
was
unable
to
go
to
germany
to
superintend
the
production
of
his
works
his
one
consolation
was
that
as
he
put
it
through
the
friendship
of
liszt
his
art
had
found
a
home
at
weimar
at
the
moment
when
he
himself
became
homeless
weimar
became
as
it
were
a
sort
of
preliminary
bayreuth
to
which
pilgrimages
were
made
to
hear
wagner
operas
liszt
not
only
produced
the
flying
dutchman
tannhäuser
and
lohengrin
but
wrote
eloquent
essays
on
them
and
in
every
possible
way
advanced
the
good
cause
it
has
been
justly
said
that
by
his
efforts
he
accelerated
the
vogue
of
operas
fully
ten
years
he
also
helped
him
pecuniarily
and
induced
others
to
do
the
same
never
in
the
world
history
has
one
artist
done
so
much
for
another
as
liszt
did
for
wagner
during
all
the
years
of
his
exile
in
switzerland
few
persons
would
consider
residence
in
switzerland
the
usual
home
in
those
days
of
political
refugees
a
special
hardship
nor
would
wagner
have
considered
it
in
that
light
except
for
the
solicitude
he
felt
for
the
children
of
his
brain
otherwise
he
greatly
enjoyed
life
in
that
glorious
country
and
the
alpine
ozone
nourished
and
stimulated
his
brain
moreover
from
the
creative
point
of
view
it
was
an
actual
advantage
for
him
to
be
away
from
the
of
the
great
capitals
in
switzerland
except
for
a
short
time
when
he
was
connected
with
the
zurich
opera
he
heard
no
operatic
music
except
such
as
his
own
brain
created
undoubtedly
this
helps
to
account
for
the
astounding
originality
of
the
he
wrote
in
switzerland
these
go
as
far
beyond
lohengrin
in
certain
directions
as
lohengrin
goes
beyond
the
operas
of
wagner
predecessors
it
was
a
reckless
thing
to
do
to
make
another
such
giant
stride
before
the
world
had
caught
up
with
his
first
and
he
had
to
suffer
the
consequences
but
genius
disregards
prudence
and
looks
to
the
future
alone
what
he
was
now
writing
was
what
his
enemies
tauntingly
called
the
music
of
the
future
because
as
they
said
nobody
liked
it
at
present
but
what
he
himself
called
the
art
work
of
the
future
in
which
all
the
fine
arts
are
inseparably
united
the
biggest
of
his
works
the
nibelung
tetralogy
was
conceived
and
for
the
most
part
written
in
switzerland
before
leaving
dresden
he
had
already
written
the
poem
of
an
opera
which
he
called
death
returning
to
this
in
his
exile
he
came
to
the
conclusion
gradually
that
the
legend
on
which
it
is
based
and
which
he
had
sketched
out
in
prose
at
the
beginning
contained
the
material
for
two
three
nay
four
operas
accordingly
he
wrote
the
poems
of
these
first
götterdämmerung
then
siegfried
die
walküre
and
rheingold
the
music
to
these
four
dramas
was
however
composed
in
the
reverse
order
in
which
they
were
to
be
performed
wagner
indulged
in
no
illusions
regarding
these
he
knew
that
they
were
beyond
the
capacity
of
even
the
best
royal
of
that
time
and
that
they
could
be
performed
only
under
exceptional
conditions
such
as
he
finally
succeeded
after
herculean
efforts
and
many
disappointments
in
securing
at
bayreuth
in
it
is
of
great
interest
to
note
that
the
germs
of
a
sort
of
bayreuth
festival
plan
can
be
found
in
his
letters
as
early
as
the
year
when
lohengrin
had
its
first
hearing
thus
a
full
quarter
of
a
century
elapsed
between
the
conception
of
this
festival
plan
and
its
execution
but
wagner
had
the
patience
of
job
as
well
as
his
capacity
for
suffering
amid
privations
of
all
sorts
he
wrote
the
sublime
music
of
these
dramas
beginning
with
rheingold
on
the
first
time
he
had
put
new
operatic
melodies
on
paper
since
the
completion
of
lohengrin
in
august
in
his
head
to
be
sure
he
had
been
carrying
much
of
the
nibelung
music
for
some
time
for
he
habitually
created
his
leading
melodies
at
the
same
time
as
the
verse
and
the
four
nibelung
poems
were
in
print
in
on
may
the
score
of
rheingold
was
completed
and
four
weeks
later
he
began
the
sketches
of
the
valkyrie
the
completed
score
of
which
was
in
his
desk
by
the
end
of
march
in
the
meantime
his
poverty
had
compelled
him
much
against
his
wishes
to
accept
an
offer
from
the
london
philharmonic
society
to
conduct
their
concerts
for
a
season
march
to
june
he
had
reason
to
bitterly
regret
this
action
with
the
limited
number
of
rehearsals
at
his
command
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
make
the
orchestra
follow
his
intentions
and
reveal
his
greatness
as
a
conductor
he
was
not
allowed
to
make
the
programmes
and
the
directors
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
they
had
engaged
the
greatest
musical
genius
of
the
century
gave
no
wagner
concert
and
put
only
a
few
short
selections
from
his
early
operas
on
the
programs
thus
his
hopes
of
creating
a
desire
for
the
hearing
of
his
complete
operas
which
had
been
one
of
his
motives
in
going
to
london
were
frustrated
he
was
moreover
constantly
abused
for
doing
things
differently
from
mendelssohn
and
the
leading
critics
referred
to
his
best
music
as
senseless
discord
inflated
display
of
extravagance
and
noise
and
so
on
almost
the
only
pleasant
episode
was
the
sympathy
and
interest
of
queen
victoria
who
had
a
long
talk
with
him
and
informed
him
that
his
music
had
enraptured
her
for
all
this
trouble
and
loss
of
time
he
found
himself
unable
in
london
to
do
any
satisfactory
work
on
the
uncompleted
valkyrie
score
he
received
the
munificent
sum
of
considerably
less
than
many
wagner
singers
get
for
one
evening
work
shortly
before
leaving
london
he
wrote
to
a
friend
that
he
would
bring
home
about
francs
for
this
he
had
wasted
four
months
of
precious
time
and
endured
endless
contrarieties
and
vulgar
animosities
to
use
his
own
words
equally
unsuccessful
were
his
efforts
a
few
years
later
to
better
himself
financially
by
a
series
of
concerts
in
paris
they
resulted
in
a
large
deficit
nor
was
he
benefited
by
the
performances
of
his
tannhäuser
which
were
given
at
the
grand
opera
in
march
by
order
of
napoleon
at
the
request
of
the
influential
princess
metternich
he
had
refused
to
interpolate
a
vulgar
ballet
in
the
second
act
for
the
benefit
of
the
members
of
the
aristocratic
jockey
club
who
dined
late
and
insisted
on
having
a
ballet
on
entering
the
they
took
their
revenge
by
creating
such
a
disturbance
every
evening
that
after
the
third
performance
wagner
refused
to
allow
any
further
repetitions
although
the
house
on
the
third
night
had
been
completely
sold
out
he
was
to
receive
for
each
performance
the
result
was
or
less
than
cents
a
day
for
a
year
hard
work
and
no
end
of
worry
in
connection
with
the
rehearsals
how
many
men
are
there
in
the
annals
of
art
who
would
have
refused
after
all
these
disappointments
and
bitter
lessons
to
make
concessions
wagner
was
writing
a
gigantic
work
the
nibelung
tetralogy
which
he
was
convinced
would
never
yield
a
penny
profit
during
his
lifetime
sometimes
despair
seized
him
in
one
of
his
letters
he
exclaims
why
should
i
poor
devil
burden
and
torture
myself
with
such
terrible
tasks
if
the
present
generation
refuses
to
let
me
have
even
a
workshop
yet
the
only
deviation
he
made
from
his
plan
was
that
when
he
had
reached
the
second
act
of
the
third
of
the
nibelung
dramas
the
poetic
siegfried
in
june
he
made
up
his
mind
to
abandon
the
tetralogy
for
the
time
being
and
compose
an
opera
which
might
be
performed
separately
and
once
more
bring
him
into
contact
with
the
stage
this
opera
was
tristan
and
isolde
but
instead
of
being
a
concession
it
turned
out
to
be
the
most
difficult
and
wagnerian
of
all
his
works
an
opera
with
much
emotion
but
little
action
no
processions
or
choruses
such
as
lohengrin
still
had
and
of
course
no
arias
or
tunes
whatever
tristan
and
isolde
was
completed
in
and
wagner
would
have
much
preferred
to
have
its
performance
in
paris
commanded
by
napoleon
in
place
of
tannhäuser
what
the
jockey
club
would
have
done
in
that
case
is
inconceivable
for
compared
with
tristan
tannhäuser
is
almost
meyerbeerian
if
not
donizettian
no
singers
moreover
could
have
been
found
in
paris
able
to
interpret
this
work
with
its
new
vocal
style
as
the
germans
call
it
even
germany
could
do
nothing
at
first
with
this
opera
in
vienna
after
rehearsals
it
was
abandoned
in
as
impossible
and
that
city
did
not
produce
it
till
after
wagner
death
instead
of
bringing
him
into
immediate
contact
with
the
stage
it
was
not
heard
till
seven
years
after
its
completion
there
was
one
more
card
for
him
to
play
all
his
operas
so
far
had
been
tragedies
what
if
he
were
to
write
a
comic
opera
would
not
that
be
likely
to
get
him
access
to
the
stage
again
and
help
him
financially
he
had
the
plan
for
a
comic
opera
indeed
he
had
sketched
it
as
early
as
at
the
same
time
as
the
plot
of
lohengrin
sixteen
years
it
lay
dormant
in
his
brain
at
last
he
wrote
out
the
poem
in
paris
immediately
after
the
tannhäuser
disaster
there
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
call
die
meistersinger
a
humorous
opera
for
while
the
story
of
the
mediaeval
knight
who
wins
the
daughter
has
comic
features
its
chief
characteristic
is
humor
with
that
undercurrent
of
seriousness
that
belongs
to
all
masterpieces
of
humor
to
a
certain
extent
it
is
a
musical
and
poetic
autobiography
the
victorious
young
knight
walter
who
sings
as
he
pleases
without
regard
to
pedantic
rules
representing
wagner
himself
and
the
music
of
the
future
while
the
vain
and
malicious
beckmesser
stands
for
the
critics
and
hans
sachs
for
enlightened
public
opinion
it
was
during
the
time
that
he
wrote
the
gloriously
melodious
and
spontaneous
music
to
this
poem
that
the
most
important
event
of
his
life
happened
work
on
the
score
was
repeatedly
interrupted
by
the
necessity
of
making
some
money
most
of
his
concerts
in
german
cities
undertaken
for
this
purpose
did
not
yield
him
any
profits
in
russia
however
he
was
very
successful
and
as
he
had
the
promise
of
a
repetition
of
his
success
he
rented
a
fine
villa
at
penzing
near
vienna
and
proceeded
to
enjoy
life
for
a
change
who
can
blame
him
for
this
as
he
said
to
a
friend
not
long
after
this
i
am
differently
organized
from
others
have
sensitive
nerves
must
have
beauty
splendor
and
light
is
it
really
such
an
outrageous
thing
if
i
lay
claim
to
the
little
bit
of
luxury
which
i
like
i
who
am
preparing
enjoyment
for
the
world
and
for
thousands
unfortunately
the
second
russian
project
failed
through
no
fault
of
his
own
and
as
he
had
borrowed
money
at
usurious
rates
on
his
expected
profits
he
found
himself
compelled
to
fly
once
more
from
his
creditors
after
spending
a
short
time
in
switzerland
he
went
to
stuttgart
where
he
persuaded
his
friend
weissheimer
to
go
with
him
into
the
suabian
alps
where
he
intended
to
hide
for
half
a
year
until
he
could
finish
his
meistersinger
and
with
the
score
raise
money
for
his
creditors
the
wagon
had
already
been
ordered
for
the
next
morning
may
and
wagner
was
packing
his
trunk
when
a
card
was
brought
up
to
him
with
the
inscription
von
pfistenmeister
secrétaire
aulique
de
le
roi
de
bavière
and
the
message
that
the
baron
came
by
order
of
the
king
of
bavaria
and
was
very
anxious
to
see
him
king
ludwig
ii
of
bavaria
had
declared
while
he
was
still
crown
prince
that
as
soon
as
he
became
king
he
would
show
the
world
how
highly
he
held
the
genius
of
wagner
in
honor
he
kept
his
word
one
of
his
first
acts
was
to
despatch
baron
von
pfistenmeister
to
search
for
wagner
and
not
to
return
without
him
he
was
to
tell
him
that
the
king
was
his
most
ardent
admirer
that
he
wanted
him
to
come
at
once
to
munich
to
live
there
in
comfort
at
the
king
expense
to
complete
his
nibelung
operas
and
produce
them
forthwith
was
it
a
wonder
that
when
the
baron
had
left
wagner
who
was
thus
suddenly
raised
from
the
depth
of
despair
he
had
even
meditated
suicide
to
the
height
of
happiness
fell
on
weissheimer
neck
and
wept
for
joy
surely
the
brain
of
a
dumas
could
not
have
conceived
a
more
romantic
event
than
this
sudden
transformation
of
one
who
was
a
fugitive
from
debtor
prison
into
the
favorite
of
a
young
and
enthusiastic
king
at
last
wagner
had
an
opportunity
to
bring
forward
his
tristan
and
isolde
was
sung
at
the
munich
opera
on
june
with
an
excellent
cast
and
hans
von
bülow
as
conductor
die
meistersinger
followed
on
june
both
these
works
were
received
with
enthusiasm
by
the
band
of
his
plan
of
building
a
special
theatre
in
munich
for
the
performance
of
his
nibelung
operas
could
not
be
carried
out
however
even
with
the
king
aid
for
his
great
influence
with
the
king
he
was
rumored
to
be
even
his
political
and
religious
adviser
though
this
was
not
true
aroused
so
much
hostile
feeling
that
wagner
finally
decided
to
have
his
nibelung
festival
at
the
old
secluded
town
of
bayreuth
at
the
suggestion
of
the
eminent
pianist
carl
taussig
wagner
societies
were
formed
in
the
cities
of
europe
and
america
to
raise
funds
for
this
festival
and
give
wagner
a
chance
to
establish
a
tradition
by
showing
the
world
how
his
operas
should
be
performed
with
the
aid
of
these
and
liberal
contributions
by
his
king
wagner
was
able
after
many
trials
tribulations
and
postponements
to
bring
out
at
last
his
great
tetralogy
on
august
and
of
the
year
it
was
beyond
comparison
the
most
interesting
and
important
event
in
the
whole
history
of
music
wagner
had
personally
visited
the
throughout
the
land
and
selected
the
best
singers
the
audience
included
the
emperors
of
germany
and
brazil
king
ludwig
the
grand
dukes
of
weimar
and
baden
eminent
composers
like
liszt
grieg
and
many
other
notable
persons
the
impression
made
by
the
great
work
was
the
deeper
because
of
the
unusual
circumstances
the
theatre
specially
constructed
after
wagner
novel
plan
the
amphitheatric
seats
the
concealed
orchestra
the
stereoscopic
clearness
and
nearness
of
the
stage
scenes
etc
the
necessity
of
charging
very
high
rates
for
the
four
dramas
naturally
prevented
the
audiences
from
being
large
and
the
result
was
that
wagner
had
a
deficit
of
on
his
hands
as
the
reward
for
his
genius
and
years
of
business
worries
when
however
his
last
work
the
sublime
parsifal
was
produced
in
there
was
a
balance
in
his
favor
he
was
then
in
his
year
and
the
exertion
of
producing
this
final
masterpiece
was
too
great
for
him
to
recuperate
he
went
to
venice
where
he
died
on
king
ludwig
sent
a
special
train
to
convey
his
body
to
bayreuth
where
it
was
buried
in
the
garden
behind
his
villa
wahnfried
since
wagner
death
the
bayreuth
festivals
have
been
kept
up
with
success
under
the
guidance
of
his
widow
cosima
the
daughter
of
liszt
whom
he
married
in
four
years
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
and
their
son
siegfried
who
has
in
recent
years
also
won
some
success
as
an
opera
composer
the
performances
at
bayreuth
are
no
longer
what
they
were
during
wagner
lifetime
models
for
all
the
world
but
they
are
still
of
unique
interest
in
truth
headquarters
like
bayreuth
are
no
longer
needed
for
all
the
german
cities
now
vie
with
one
another
in
their
efforts
to
interpret
the
wagner
operas
according
to
the
composer
intentions
and
his
influence
on
other
musicians
which
began
with
the
performance
of
lohengrin
under
liszt
in
is
greater
than
ever
more
powerful
perhaps
than
that
ever
exerted
by
any
other
master
but
while
an
eminent
german
critic
wrote
not
long
ago
that
the
of
wagner
constitutes
modern
opera
it
would
be
a
huge
mistake
to
make
wagnerism
synonymous
with
modern
music
in
general
apart
from
the
opera
there
are
several
other
very
powerful
currents
and
while
most
of
them
can
be
traced
to
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
are
none
the
less
modern
their
principal
sources
are
beethoven
schubert
and
chopin
to
whom
we
must
add
in
the
second
half
of
the
century
liszt
the
symphonies
of
haydn
and
mozart
are
like
compared
with
the
massive
architecture
of
beethoven
he
not
only
elaborated
the
forms
but
varied
the
rhythms
broadened
the
melody
and
deepened
the
expression
of
orchestral
music
in
his
works
too
are
to
be
found
the
germs
of
romanticism
which
others
notably
mendelssohn
and
schumann
developed
so
fascinatingly
in
their
best
works
most
of
compositions
have
had
their
day
but
schumann
is
still
a
force
in
modern
music
and
will
long
remain
so
brahms
the
musical
browning
is
musically
speaking
a
son
of
schumann
and
a
grandson
of
beethoven
while
even
brahms
did
not
escape
the
influence
of
wagner
nor
that
of
the
romanticists
schubert
and
chopin
still
in
his
essence
he
represents
reaction
against
modern
romanticism
and
an
atavistic
return
to
the
spirit
of
beethoven
he
has
been
for
decades
the
idol
of
wagner
enemies
yet
in
truth
there
was
no
occasion
for
opposing
these
two
men
since
they
worked
in
entirely
different
fields
brahms
wrote
no
operas
while
wagner
wrote
little
but
operas
the
real
antagonist
of
brahms
is
liszt
who
also
worked
only
for
the
concert
hall
and
who
represents
poetic
or
pictorial
music
programme
music
while
brahms
stands
for
absolute
music
or
music
without
any
poetic
affiliations
while
schubert
in
his
youth
also
came
under
the
influence
of
his
great
contemporary
beethoven
he
soon
emancipated
himself
completely
from
him
even
in
the
symphony
in
which
as
schumann
pointed
out
he
opened
up
an
entirely
new
world
of
melody
color
and
emotion
his
orchestration
is
more
varied
euphonious
and
enchanting
than
beethoven
and
in
this
direction
he
did
for
the
symphony
what
weber
did
for
the
opera
by
using
the
brass
instruments
pianissimo
for
color
instead
of
for
loudness
he
opened
a
path
in
which
later
masters
including
wagner
eagerly
followed
him
schubert
was
also
the
first
composer
who
revealed
the
exquisite
beauty
and
the
great
emotional
power
of
the
freest
modulation
from
key
to
key
his
poetic
impromptus
for
piano
became
the
model
for
mendelssohn
songs
without
words
and
the
multitudinous
forms
of
modern
short
pieces
while
his
melodious
dainty
graceful
valses
were
the
forerunners
of
the
exquisite
which
subsequently
made
vienna
famous
and
which
reached
its
climax
in
johann
strauss
the
younger
universally
known
as
the
waltz
king
in
all
these
respects
schubert
was
and
if
the
beautiful
details
he
suggested
to
his
successors
up
to
the
present
day
could
be
taken
out
of
their
works
there
would
be
some
surprising
blanks
especially
also
is
this
true
in
the
realm
of
lyric
song
for
as
everybody
knows
he
practically
created
the
art
song
as
we
know
and
love
it
the
greatest
of
his
immediate
successors
schumann
and
franz
cheerfully
admitted
that
they
could
never
have
written
such
songs
as
they
gave
the
world
but
for
schubert
and
the
same
confession
might
be
made
by
the
latest
of
the
great
songwriters
grieg
richard
strauss
and
our
american
macdowell
schubert
best
songs
have
never
been
equalled
they
belong
in
the
realm
of
modern
music
quite
as
much
as
and
liszt
symphonic
poems
chopin
is
another
composer
who
although
he
died
in
schubert
died
in
is
as
modern
as
the
masters
just
named
he
was
as
boldly
original
as
schubert
and
as
great
a
magician
in
the
art
of
arousing
deep
emotion
by
means
of
novel
unexpected
modulations
as
an
originator
of
new
harmonic
progressions
he
has
had
only
three
equals
bach
schubert
and
wagner
harmonies
as
as
those
of
parsifal
may
be
found
in
some
of
the
mazurkas
of
chopin
he
was
as
rubinstein
called
him
the
soul
of
the
pianoforte
no
one
before
or
after
him
knew
how
to
make
that
instrument
speak
so
eloquently
by
ingeniously
scattering
the
notes
of
a
chord
over
the
keyboard
while
holding
down
the
pedal
he
practically
gave
the
player
three
or
four
hands
and
greatly
enlarged
the
harmonic
and
coloristic
possibilities
of
the
pianoforte
liszt
rubinstein
paderewski
and
others
have
gone
farther
still
in
the
same
direction
but
he
showed
the
way
and
most
of
his
pieces
are
as
delightful
and
as
modern
now
as
they
were
on
the
day
when
they
were
written
he
wrote
a
few
sonatas
but
the
majority
of
his
works
are
short
pieces
such
as
are
characteristic
of
the
modern
romantic
school
before
chopin
modernized
pianoforte
music
the
world
greatest
composers
had
been
italians
germans
and
frenchmen
chopin
father
was
a
frenchman
but
his
mother
was
a
native
of
poland
and
he
was
born
in
that
country
while
his
music
has
the
french
qualities
of
elegance
and
clearness
which
every
one
admires
in
the
works
of
gounod
bizet
massenet
and
other
parisian
masters
in
its
essence
it
is
polish
a
fact
of
special
significance
for
from
this
time
on
other
nations
than
the
three
mentioned
especially
the
slavic
and
scandinavian
begin
to
play
a
prominent
role
in
music
in
this
brief
sketch
only
the
greatest
names
can
be
considered
such
names
as
rubinstein
tschaikowsky
dvorák
grieg
rubinstein
was
not
only
one
of
the
greatest
pianists
but
one
of
the
most
spontaneous
and
fertile
melodists
of
all
times
his
frequently
careless
workmanship
and
his
foolish
savage
hostility
to
the
dominant
wagner
movement
prevented
him
from
enjoying
the
fruits
of
his
rare
genius
he
felt
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
wagner
he
himself
might
have
been
as
popular
as
mendelssohn
although
a
russian
there
is
little
local
color
in
his
music
for
the
enchanting
exotic
melodic
intervals
in
his
persian
songs
are
oriental
in
general
rather
than
russian
in
particular
similar
exotic
intervals
may
be
found
in
the
aïda
of
verdi
a
pure
italian
rubinstein
like
mendelssohn
and
meyerbeer
was
a
hebrew
his
day
will
yet
come
for
his
dramatic
and
ocean
symphonies
are
among
the
grandest
orchestral
works
in
existence
his
countryman
tschaikowsky
also
was
neglected
during
his
lifetime
but
since
his
death
he
has
become
especially
in
london
almost
as
popular
as
wagner
and
deservedly
so
for
he
was
a
genius
of
the
highest
type
less
in
his
songs
and
pianoforte
works
than
in
his
symphonies
and
symphonic
poems
which
include
some
of
the
most
inspired
pages
in
modern
music
in
some
of
his
compositions
there
is
a
barbaric
splendor
which
proclaims
the
russian
and
delights
those
who
like
exotic
novelty
in
music
like
all
the
russians
tschaikowsky
was
strongly
influenced
by
liszt
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
in
russia
liszt
was
more
potent
in
shaping
the
course
of
modern
music
than
even
wagner
another
slavic
composer
the
bohemian
dvorák
is
of
special
interest
to
americans
not
only
because
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
modern
orchestral
writers
a
colorist
of
rare
charm
but
because
he
presided
for
several
years
over
thurber
national
conservatory
of
music
in
new
york
and
there
wrote
that
truly
melodious
and
deeply
emotional
work
from
the
new
world
which
has
become
almost
as
popular
as
tschaikowsky
pathétique
his
bohemian
rhythms
have
a
unique
charm
among
the
scandinavian
composers
the
greatest
by
far
is
grieg
one
of
the
most
original
melodists
and
harmonists
of
all
times
his
songs
in
particular
are
destined
to
immortality
they
are
among
the
very
best
written
since
schubert
of
his
pianoforte
and
chamber
music
too
it
can
be
said
that
everything
is
new
free
from
commonplace
and
he
has
written
mostly
short
pieces
and
for
that
reason
has
had
to
wait
like
chopin
in
his
day
a
long
time
for
full
recognition
of
his
genius
the
critics
not
having
yet
got
over
the
foolish
habit
of
measuring
with
a
yardstick
like
chopin
moreover
grieg
has
had
the
of
having
his
most
original
and
individual
traits
accredited
to
his
nation
and
described
as
national
peculiarities
his
music
does
contain
such
peculiarities
but
it
is
necessary
to
distinguish
between
what
is
norwegian
and
what
is
griegian
grieg
little
pieces
and
songs
are
big
with
genius
the
hungarian
liszt
is
another
immortal
master
who
beside
the
fruits
of
his
individual
genius
contributed
to
the
current
of
modern
music
some
of
those
exotic
national
traits
which
distinguish
it
from
that
of
earlier
epochs
when
it
was
almost
exclusively
italian
french
and
german
his
fifteen
hungarian
rhapsodies
constitute
however
only
a
small
part
of
the
invaluable
legacy
he
has
left
the
world
he
was
the
most
of
all
musicians
the
greatest
of
all
pianists
and
one
of
the
best
composers
of
oratorios
songs
orchestral
and
pianoforte
works
everything
in
short
except
operas
and
chamber
music
he
was
also
the
greatest
of
teachers
and
with
the
exception
of
wagner
the
greatest
of
conductors
as
such
he
carried
out
both
his
own
and
wagner
new
and
revolutionary
principles
of
interpretation
which
have
gradually
made
the
orchestral
conductor
a
personage
of
even
greater
importance
in
concert
hall
and
than
the
prima
donna
travelling
like
her
from
city
to
city
to
delight
lovers
of
music
one
might
have
expected
that
the
prince
of
pianists
being
at
the
same
time
a
composer
would
do
for
the
pianoforte
what
bach
had
done
for
choral
and
organ
music
beethoven
for
the
symphony
schubert
for
the
art
song
and
wagner
for
the
opera
but
he
could
not
for
chopin
had
anticipated
him
in
only
one
direction
was
it
possible
to
go
beyond
chopin
in
that
of
making
the
piano
capable
of
reproducing
orchestral
effects
this
liszt
achieved
in
his
own
works
and
his
transcriptions
but
after
all
the
grandest
pianoforte
while
delightful
as
such
is
but
a
poor
substitute
for
an
orchestra
hence
it
was
natural
that
liszt
should
give
up
the
pianoforte
as
his
specialty
and
devote
himself
particularly
to
the
orchestra
in
this
domain
he
was
destined
to
achieve
reforms
similar
to
those
of
wagner
in
the
opera
the
classical
symphony
like
the
opera
consists
of
detached
numbers
or
movements
that
have
no
organic
connection
with
one
another
for
the
detached
numbers
of
the
opera
wagner
substituted
his
continuous
melody
and
he
provided
an
organic
connection
of
all
the
parts
by
means
of
the
leading
motives
or
characteristic
melodies
and
chords
which
recur
whenever
the
situation
calls
for
them
in
the
same
spirit
liszt
transformed
the
symphony
into
the
symphonic
poem
which
is
continuous
and
has
a
leading
motive
uniting
all
its
parts
there
is
another
aspect
to
the
symphonic
poem
in
which
liszt
deviated
from
wagner
in
wagner
operas
there
is
plenty
of
descriptive
or
pictorial
music
but
no
program
music
properly
speaking
for
even
in
such
things
as
the
ride
of
the
valkyries
or
the
magic
fire
scene
the
music
does
not
depend
on
a
programme
but
is
explained
by
the
scenery
in
programme
music
on
the
other
hand
the
scene
or
the
poetic
idea
is
simply
explained
in
the
programme
or
else
merely
hinted
at
in
the
title
of
the
piece
crude
attempts
in
this
direction
were
made
centuries
ago
but
programme
music
as
an
important
branch
of
music
is
a
modern
phenomenon
beethoven
encouraged
it
by
his
pastoral
symphony
and
the
french
berlioz
did
some
very
remarkable
things
in
this
line
in
his
dramatic
symphonies
but
it
remained
for
liszt
to
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
in
his
symphonic
poems
the
french
followed
him
rather
than
his
countryman
berlioz
so
did
tschaikowsky
dvorák
and
most
modern
composers
up
to
richard
strauss
whose
symphonic
poems
are
the
most
widely
discussed
praised
and
abused
compositions
of
our
time
to
the
great
names
contained
in
the
preceding
paragraphs
another
must
be
added
that
of
an
italian
by
an
odd
coincidence
verdi
was
born
in
the
same
year
as
wagner
but
what
is
far
more
remarkable
is
that
at
the
close
of
their
careers
so
different
otherwise
these
two
great
composers
met
again
in
their
music
verdi
as
a
wagnerian
convert
up
to
his
year
verdi
had
written
two
dozen
operas
all
made
up
of
strings
of
arias
in
the
way
superb
arias
many
of
them
especially
in
il
trovatore
and
aïda
but
still
arias
then
he
rested
from
his
labors
sixteen
years
and
when
he
appeared
on
the
stage
again
with
his
otello
and
falstaff
he
had
adopted
wagner
maxims
that
arias
are
out
of
place
in
a
that
the
play
the
thing
and
that
the
music
should
follow
the
text
word
for
word
surely
this
was
the
most
remarkable
of
wagner
triumphs
and
conquests
he
who
had
been
denounced
for
decades
as
being
unable
to
write
properly
for
the
voice
was
actually
taken
up
as
a
model
by
the
greatest
composer
of
italy
the
land
of
song
moreover
all
the
young
composers
of
italy
have
turned
their
backs
on
the
traditions
of
italian
opera
the
chief
ambition
of
mascagni
leoncavallo
puccini
and
all
the
others
has
been
to
be
called
the
italian
wagner
and
their
operas
are
much
more
like
wagner
than
like
rossini
and
donizetti
being
free
from
arias
and
the
vocal
embroideries
that
formerly
were
the
essence
of
italian
opera
the
same
is
true
of
the
operas
written
in
recent
decades
in
france
germany
and
other
countries
massenet
humperdinck
goldmark
richard
strauss
paderewski
and
all
the
others
have
followed
in
wagner
footsteps
such
briefly
told
is
the
story
of
richard
wagner
and
modern
music
the
music
of
the
future
has
become
the
music
of
the
present
what
the
future
will
bring
no
one
can
tell
croakers
say
as
they
have
always
said
that
the
race
of
giants
has
died
out
but
who
knew
fifty
years
ago
that
wagner
and
liszt
or
even
their
predecessors
chopin
and
schumann
and
the
song
specialist
robert
franz
were
giants
we
know
it
now
and
future
generations
will
know
whether
we
have
giants
among
us
things
of
beauty
that
will
be
a
joy
forever
have
been
created
by
men
of
genius
now
living
in
europe
such
men
as
the
norwegian
grieg
the
bohemian
dvorák
the
french
and
massenet
the
hungarian
goldmark
the
german
humperdinck
and
richard
strauss
the
polish
paderewski
england
has
more
good
composers
and
listeners
than
it
ever
had
before
and
the
same
is
true
of
america
we
have
no
school
of
opera
yet
but
the
best
operettas
of
victor
herbert
and
de
koven
deserve
mention
by
the
side
of
those
of

equal
to
anything

the

unsound
economic
gospel
valuable
though
it
may
be
in
illustrating
and
enforcing
morality
in
its
aesthetic
aspect
despite
his
enemies
and
all
that
the
critics
have
said
contradicting
his
theories
ruskin
was
a
surprise
and
a
revelation
to
his
time
in
not
a
little
of
all
that
he
said
and
did
it
is
true
we
can
not
concur
nor
can
we
fail
to
see
the
errors
he
fell
into
through
his
want
of
reserve
and
his
headlong
haste
to
say
and
do
the
things
he
said
and
did
nevertheless
he
was
a
great
and
inspiring
teacher
in
things
that
appeal
to
our
sense
of
the
beautiful
and
earnest
in
his
zeal
to
raise
men
intellectual
and
moral
standard
of
life
like
most
enthusiasts
and
geniuses
he
had
now
and
then
his
hours
of
reaction
waywardness
and
gloom
but
there
was
much
that
was
noble
and
ennobling
in
the
man
as
well
as
rich
and
fructifying
in
his
thought
even
in
his
social
and
moral
exhortations
tinctured
as
they
are
with
medievalism
and
however
much
we
may
here
again
disagree
with
him
he
had
much
that
was
uplifting
and
inspiring
to
say
to
his
time
a
time
that
had
great
need
of
his
apostolic
counsellings
and
his
fervent
inculcations
of
morality
industry
religion
and
humanity
throughout
ruskin
works
and
they
are
amazingly
manifold
a
strong
and
intense
purpose
runs
given
to
the
highest
and
noblest
ends
and
though
their
author
at
times
wearies
his
reader
by
his
diffuseness
and
his
digressions
and
to
some
is
almost
fanatical
in
his
reverence
for
art
he
is
ever
imaginative
and
eloquent
and
has
created
for
us
a
new
instructive
and
uniquely
fresh
and
thoughtful
body
of
the
truth
of
infinite
value
he
teaches
is
realism
the
doctrine
that
all
truth
and
beauty
are
to
be
attained
by
a
reverent
and
faithful
study
of
nature
and
not
as
a
reviewer
expresses
it
by
substituting
vague
forms
bred
by
imagination
on
the
mists
of
feeling
in
place
of
definite
substantial
reality
the
thorough
acceptance
of
this
doctrine
would
remould
our
life
and
he
who
teaches
its
application
even
to
any
single
department
of
human
activity
and
with
such
power
as
ruskin
is
a
prophet
for
his
generation
in
all
his
various
labors
and
aims
ruskin
set
before
himself
a
high
if
somewhat
quixotic
ideal
of
life
and
with
great
earnestness
did
much
not
only
for
the
elevation
of
his
but
for
the
development
of
sound
artistic
taste
and
the
enriching
and
spiritualizing
of
life
by
seeking
to
surround
it
at
all
times
with
the
true
and
the
beautiful
and
with
the
virtues
of
purity
manliness
and
courage
among
the
beacon
lights
of
the
age
there
can
be
no
question
that
ruskin
is
worthy
of
an
exalted
place
since
few
men
of
our
modern
time
rich
as
it
is
in
eminent
thinkers
and
writers
has
done
more
than
he
to
illumine
the
many
subjects
with
which
he
has
so
fascinatingly
dealt
and
that
not
only
in
art
and
its
cult
of
the
beautiful
but
in
ethics
education
and
political
economy
the
energies
activities
and
impulses
he
constantly
put
forth
as
well
as
the
high
principles
that
ever
guided
him
in
his
earnest
endeavor
to
improve
the
intellectual
and
moral
condition
of
his
kind
mark
his
era
as
a
great
artistic
epoch
in
the
onward
and
upward
progress
of
the
race
by
stimulus
suggestion
and
inspiration
he
has
powerfully
influenced
his
time
though
manifestly
not
a
little
of
the
seed
he
abundantly
and
hopefully
scattered
has
fallen
upon
barren
ground
nevertheless
where
the
seed
has
fallen
and
germinated
the
yield
has
been
large
his
spirit
has
passed
far
wider
than
he
ever
knew
or
conceived
and
his
words
flung
to
the
winds
have
borne
fruit
a
hundredfold
in
lands
that
he
never
thought
of
or
designed
to
reach
with
what
pride
and
gratitude
should
not
the
age
regard
him
and
his
memory
one
who
has
quickened
the
sensibilities
of
men
in
looking
upon
nature
opened
our
dull
eyes
to
its
manifold
beauties
made
plain
to
the
average
intelligence
what
art
is
and
stands
for
implanted
in
our
souls
worship
of
the
beautiful
shown
how
to
use
their
tools
in
the
highest
interests
of
their
craft
and
taught
maidens
what
and
how
to
read
as
well
as
how
and
in
what
spirit
to
sew
and
cook
the
world
too
often
acknowledges
its
true
teachers
and
prophets
only
when
it
begins
to
build
them
some
belated
tomb

at
any
rate

footnote
written
by
on
professor
ruskin
eightieth
birthday
february
we
may
all
of
us
recall
with
love
and
gratitude
the
enormous
mass
of
stirring
thoughts
and
melodious
speech
about
a
thousand
things
divine
and
human
beautiful
and
good
which
for
a
whole
the
author
of
painters
has
given
to
the
world
they
cover
every
phase
of
nature
every
type
of
art
of
history
society
economics
religion
the
past
and
the
future
all
rules
of
human
duty
whether
personal
or
social
domestic
or
national
he
spake
to
us
of
trees
from
the
cedar
of
lebanon
unto
the
hyssop
on
the
wall
he
spake
also
of
beasts
and
of
fowl
and
of
creeping
things
and
of
fishes
he
has
put
new
beauty
for
us
into
the
sky
and
the
clouds
and
the
rainbow
into
the
seas
at
rest
or
in
storm
into
the
mountains
and
into
the
lakes
into
the
flowers
and
the
grass
into
crystals
and
gems
into
the
mightiest
ruins
of
past
ages
and
into
the
humblest
rose
upon
a
cottage
wall
he
has
done
for
the
alps
and
the
cathedrals
of
italy
and
france
for
venice
and
florence
what
byron
did
for
greece
we
look
upon
them
all
now
with
new
and
more
searching
eyes
whole
schools
of
art
entire
ages
of
old
workmanship
the
very
soul
of
the
middle
age
have
been
revealed
with
a
new
inspiration
and
transfigured
in
a
more
mysterious
light
poetry
greek
sculpture
mediaeval
worship
commercial
morality
the
training
of
the
young
the
nobility
of
industry
the
purity
of
the

a
thousand
things
that
make
up
the
joy
and
soundness
of
human
life
have
been
irradiated
by
the
flashing
searchlight
of
one
ardent
soul
irradiated
let
us
say
as
this
dazzling
ray
shot
round
the
horizon
glancing
from
heaven
to
earth
and
touching
the
gloom
with
fire
we
need
not
even
be
tempted
from
truth
or
pretend
that
the
light
is
permanent
or
complete
it
has
long
ceased
to
flash
round
the
welkin
and
its
very
scintillations
have
disturbed
our
true
vision
but
we
remember
still
its
dazzling
power
and
its
revelation
of
things
that
our
eyes
had
not
seen
what
we
especially
love
to
dwell
on
is
this
that
in
all
this
unrivalled
volume
of
printed
thoughts
in
this
encyclopaedic
range
of
topic
by
this
most
voluminous
and
most
versatile
of
modern
writers
may
we
not
say
of
all
english
writers
there
is
not
one
line
that
is
base
or
coarse
or
frivolous
not
a
sentence
that
was
framed
in
envy
malice
wantonness
or
cruelty
not
one
piece
that
was
written
to
win
money
or
popularity
or
promotion
not
a
line
composed
for
any
selfish
end
or
in
any
trivial
mood
think
what
we
may
of
this
enormous
library
of
print
we
know
that
every
word
of
it
was
put
forth
of
set
purpose
without
any
hidden
aim
utterly
without
fear
and
wholly
without
guile
to
make
the
world
a
little
better
to
guide
inspire
and
teach
men
come
what
might
scoff
as
they
would
turn
from
him
as
they
chose
though
they
left
him
alone
a
broken
old
man
crying
in
the
wilderness
with
none
to
hear
or
to
care
they
might
think
it
all
utterly
vain
we
may
think
much
of
it
was
in
vain
but
it
was
always
the
very
heart
blood
of
a
rare
genius
and
a
noble
soul
before
entering
somewhat
in
detail
into
ruskin
vast
and
varied
labors
let
us
briefly
outline
the
scope
and
character
of
the
work
which
gave
the
art
critic
and
prophet
of
his
time
his
chief
fame
the
personal
incidents
in
his
life
need
not
detain
us
at
the
outset
as
they
are
not
specially
eventful
and
may
be
more
fully
gathered
from
the
excellent
life
of
ruskin
by
his
friend
and
secretary
collingwood
or
from
the
delightfully
interesting
reminiscences
by
the
master
himself
in
his
autobiographic
praeterita
published
near
the
close
of
his
long
arduous
and
fruitful
career
john
ruskin
was
born
in
london
on
the
of
february
he
was
of
scotch
ancestry
his
father
being
a
prosperous
wine
merchant
in
london
who
acquired
considerable
wealth
in
trade
which
the
son
in
time
inherited
and
nobly
used
in
his
many
private
benevolences
and
philanthropic
enterprises
the
comfortable
circumstances
in
which
he
was
born
coupled
with
his
father
own
love
of
pictures
and
books
were
helpful
in
giving
encouragement
and
direction
to
the
young
student
studies
and
tastes
his
mother
a
deeply
religious
woman
was
moreover
influential
in
implanting
the
serious
element
in
ruskin
character
and
life
and
in
familiarizing
him
with
the
bible
whose
noble
english
in
king
version
manifestly
entered
early
into
the
youth
ardent
prophetic
soul
and
as
a
writer
had
much
to
do
in
forming
his
magnificent
prose
style
ruskin
was
in
early
years
indeed
far
on
in
his
manhood
in
delicate
health
and
consequently
he
was
educated
privately
till
he
passed
to
christ
church
college
oxford
where
at
the
age
of
twenty
he
won
the
newdigate
prize
for
verse
and
graduated
in
his
taste
for
art
was
manifested
at
an
early
age
and
after
passing
from
the
university
he
studied
painting
under
harding
and
copley
fielding
but
his
masters
as
he
tells
us
in
praeterita
were
rubens
and
rembrandt
at
the
outset
of
his
career
ruskin
as
is
well
known
was
led
to
take
up
a
defence
of
turner
and
the
contemporary
school
of
english
against
the
foreign
trammels
which
had
fastened
themselves
upon
modern
art
and
especially
to
prove
the
superiority
of
modern
over
the
old
masters
this
revolutionary
opinion
though
at
first
it
was
hotly
contested
established
the
new
critic
position
as
a
writer
on
art
and
the
defence
or
exposition
rather
grew
into
the
famous
work
called
modern
painters
this
elaborate
work
deals
with
general
aesthetic
principles
and
notwithstanding
its
occasional
extravagances
alike
of
praise
and
censure
its
charm
is
irresistible
presenting
us
with
its
brilliant
and
original
author
ideas
of
beauty
to
which
he
freshly
and
powerfully
awakened
the
world
while
enshrining
throughout
the
work
the
most
enchanting
on
mountain
leaf
cloud
and
sea
which
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
will
live
forever
in
english
literature
in
the
second
volume
ruskin
takes
up
the
italian
painters
and
discusses
at
length
the
merits
of
their
respective
schools
in
the
others
as
well
as
in
the
work
as
a
whole
we
have
a
body
of
principles
which
should
govern
high
as
well
as
new
ideas
as
to
what
should
constitute
the
equipment
of
the
painter
and
that
not
only
as
regards
the
technique
of
his
art
but
in
the
effect
to
be
produced
on
the
onlooker
in
viewing
the
skilled
work
of
one
who
above
all
accomplishments
should
be
lovingly
and
intimately
in
contact
with
nature
from
the
study
of
painting
ruskin
passed
for
a
time
to
that
of
architecture
in
this
department
we
have
from
his
pen
the
seven
lamps
of
architecture
and
the
stones
of
venice
in
these
two
complementary
works
their
author
sets
forth
as
in
an
impressive
sermon
the
new
and
admonitory
lesson
that
architecture
is
the
exponent
of
the
national
characteristics
of
a
people
the
higher
and
nobler
sort
exemplifying
the
religious
life
and
moral
virtue
in
a
nation
the
debased
variety
on
the
other
hand
expressing
the
ignoble
qualities
of
national
vice
and
shame
the
text
of
the
stones
is
venice
and
the
design
of
the
volumes
in
the
author
words
is
to
show
that
the
gothic
architecture
of
venice
had
arisen
out
of
and
indicated
a
state
of
pure
domestic
faith
and
national
virtue
while
its
renaissance
architecture
had
arisen
out
of
and
indicated
a
state
of
concealed
national
infidelity
and
domestic
corruption
the
earlier
work
the
seven
lamps
the
lamp
of
sacrifice
of
truth
power
beauty
life
memory
obedience
looks
upon
architecture
as
the
revealing
medium
or
lamp
through
which
flame
a
people
passions
the
embodiment
of
their
polity
life
history
and
religious
faith
in
temple
and
palace
mart
and
home
akin
to
these
two
eloquent
works
in
which
their
author
thoughtfully
sets
forth
the
civic
virtues
and
moral
tone
as
well
as
the
debased
characteristics
by
which
architecture
is
produced
at
certain
eras
in
a
people
life
is
the
earlier
volume
on
the
poetry
of
architecture
which
discusses
the
relation
between
architecture
and
its
setting
of
landscape
or
other
environment
illustrated
by
examples
drawn
from
regions
he
had
visited
the
english
lakeland
france
switzerland
spain
and
northern
italy
after
these
works
followed
lectures
on
drawing
perspective
decoration
and
manufacture
with
later
theories
crotchets
some
have
impiously
called
them
on
political
economy
with
a
flood
of
opinions
on
social
ethical
and
art
subjects
enriched
by
rare
intellectual
gifts
and
much
religious
fervor
ruskin
whole
writings
form
a
body
of
literature
unique
of
its
kind
pervaded
with
great
charm
of
literary
style
and
inspired
by
a
high
moral
purpose
excursions
into
fields
and
the
strange
jumble
of
christian
communism
to
which
late
in
life
he
gave
vehement
expression
it
must
be
honestly
admitted
have
detracted
much
from
his
early
fame
in
everything
he
wrote
the
ruskinian
spirit
comes
strongly
out
colored
with
an
amiable
egotism
and
enforced
by
great
assurance
of
conviction
the
moral
purpose
he
had
in
view
and
the
charm
and
elevated
tone
of
his
writings
lead
us
to
forget
the
wholly
ideal
state
of
society
he
sought
to
introduce
while
we
are
won
to
the
man
by
the
passion
of
his
noble
enthusiasms
like
carlyle
and
emerson
ruskin
was
by
his
parents
intended
for
the
ministry
but
for
the
ministry
he
had
himself
no
inclination
the
broadening
out
early
of
his
mind
and
the
freeing
of
his
thought
on
doctrinal
subjects
which
took
him
far
from
the
narrow
evangelicalism
of
his
youth
made
the
ministry
of
the
church
repugnant
to
him
though
he
was
always
a
deeply
religious
man
and
a
force
ever
making
for
righteousness
at
the
same
time
he
numbered
many
divines
among
his
most
cherished
friends
and
he
frequently
and
with
admitted
edification
was
to
be
found
in
chapel
and
church
meanwhile
he
continued
busily
to
educate
himself
for
whatever
profession
he
might
choose
or
drift
into
supplemented
by
such
fitful
periods
of
schooling
as
his
delicate
health
permitted
as
well
as
by
many
jaunts
with
his
parents
to
the
english
lakes
and
other
parts
of
the
kingdom
and
by
frequent
tours
on
the
continent
especially
in
italy
and
switzerland
before
he
arrived
at
his
teens
young
ruskin
had
composed
much
both
in
prose
and
verse
and
he
early
manifested
an
aptitude
for
drawing
as
well
as
a
decided
taste
for
art
which
it
is
said
was
in
some
measure
incited
by
the
gift
from
a
partner
of
his
father
of
a
copy
of
the
poet
rogers
italy
with
engravings
by
turner
nor
early
in
manhood
did
he
escape
a
fond
dream
of
love
for
as
a
worshipper
of
beauty
and
an
enthusiast
of
the
wizard
of
the
north
we
find
him
drawn
tenderly
to
a
daughter
of
lockhart
editor
of
the
quarterly
review
a
grandchild
of
his
famous
countryman
sir
walter
scott
the
affair
however
though
encouraged
by
his
parents
who
longed
to
see
their
son
settled
in
life
came
to
nought
chiefly
owing
to
the
young
lover
weak
physical
frame
and
uncertain
health
later
on
unhappily
he
was
caught
in
the
toils
of
another
scottish
lass
for
whom
it
is
related
he
had
written
the
king
of
the
golden
river
and
whose
rare
beauty
had
readily
attracted
him
with
her
in
he
made
an
marriage
only
to
find
some
years
afterwards
his
heart
riven
and
a
bitter
ingredient
dropped
into
his
life
chalice
by
a
fatal
defection
on
the
wife
part
she
having
become
enamoured
of
the
then
rising
young
painter
millais
whom
ruskin
had
trustingly
invited
to
his
house
to
paint
her
portrait
the
sequel
of
the
affair
is
a
pitiful
one
which
ruskin
ever
afterward
hid
deep
in
his
heart
though
at
the
time
finding
that
the
woman
was
unable
to
live
at
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
altitude
of
her
loyal
husband
the
latter
with
a
magnanimity
beyond
parallel
pardoned
both
millais
and
the
erring
one
consented
to
a
divorce
and
actually
stood
by
her
at
the
altar
as
the
faithless
one
took
upon
herself
new
vows
unto
a
new
husband
the
estrangement
and
loss
of
a
wife
gave
ruskin
afresh
to
art
his
true
and
fondly
cherished
bride
at
this
period
as
we
know
english
painting
was
at
a
low
ebb
mediocre
and
conventional
though
with
a
show
of
artificial
brilliance
ruskin
with
his
scorn
of
the
artificial
and
scholastic
threw
himself
into
the
work
of
overturning
the
established
complacent
school
of
the
time
and
with
splendid
enthusiasm
and
an
unfailing
belief
in
himself
and
his
ideas
he
undertook
to
reform
what
had
been
and
to
raise
current
conceptions
of
art
to
a
more
exalted
and
lofty
plane
we
have
seen
what
he
had
already
achieved
in
his
first
dashing
period
of
literary
activity
in
the
production
of
the
early
volumes
of
modern
painters
and
in
his
seven
lamps
and
stones
of
venice
while
he
was
at
work
on
the
concluding
volumes
of
the
first
and
last
of
these
great
books
there
arose
in
england
the
somewhat
fantastic
movement
in
art
launched
by
the
brotherhood
which
included
such
ruskinites
and
other
devotees
of
early
christian
and
mediaeval
painting
as
rossetti
millais
morris
and
holman
hunt
towards
this
new
school
of
symbolists
and
affectationists
ruskin
was
not
at
first
drawn
since
it
seemed
to
him
unduly
idealistic
if
not
mystic
and
smacked
not
a
little
as
he
thought
of
popery
later
however
he
saw
good
in
it
as
a
breaking
away
from
academic
trammels
while
he
recognized
the
earnest
enthusiasm
of
the
little
band
of
artists
and
as
well
as
their
technical
dexterity
and
brilliance
with
ready
decision
as
well
as
with
his
accustomed
zeal
for
art
ruskin
ended
by
defending
and
applauding
the
new
innovators
particularly
as
their
chief
motive
was
the
one
the
master
had
always
strenuously
pled
for
adherence
to
the
simplicity
of
nature
their
scrupulous
attention
to
detail
characteristic
of
the
later
on
bore
good
results
even
after
the
brotherhood
fell
apart
especially
in
william
application
of
their
to
household
decoration
and
furnishings
but
for
the
time
the
movement
was
loudly
mocked
and
decried
and
perhaps
all
the
more
because
of
ruskin
espousal
of
the
fervid
band
his
letters
of
defence
in
the
london
times
and
his
discussion
in
his
booklet
on
heedless
of
the
outcry
ruskin
pursued
his
own
course
and
by
the
year
he
had
completed
his
modern
painters
and
in
spite
of
objurgation
and
detraction
had
won
a
great
name
for
himself
as
a
critic
and
expounder
while
expanding
himself
over
almost
the
whole
world
of
art
we
have
said
that
as
a
movement
in
art
was
contemporaneously
jeered
at
while
among
superficial
or
inappreciative
students
of
the
period
seriously
to
mention
it
or
any
of
its
cultured
brotherhood
is
to
provoke
a
smile
nevertheless
there
was
not
a
little
high
merit
in
the
movement
which
ruskin
was
and
friendly
enough
to
recognize
while
much
that
is
worthy
afterwards
came
out
of
it
in
the
later
work
of
the
more
notable
of
its
members
as
well
as
in
that
of
their
unenrolled
associates
and
the
admirers
of
the
method
what
the
movement
owed
to
ruskin
is
now
frankly
conceded
in
the
lesson
the
brotherhood
took
to
heart
from
his
counsellings
to
divest
art
of
conventionality
and
to
work
with
scrupulous
fidelity
and
sincerity
of
purpose
nor
was
contemporary
art
alone
the
gainer
by
the
movement
it
also
had
its
influence
on
poetry
though
this
has
been
obscured
so
far
as
any
beneficial
influence
can
be
traced
at
all
by
the
tendency
manifested
in
some
of
the
more
amorous
poetic
swains
of
the
period
who
professed
to
derive
their
inspiration
from
the
brotherhood
to
identify
themselves
with
what
has
been
styled
the
fleshly
school
of
verse
of
the
latter
number
swinburne
in
his
early
poems
and
ballads
was
perhaps
the
greatest
sinner
though
atoned
for
in
part
by
the
lyrical
art
and
ardor
of
his
verse
and
much
more
by
the
higher
qualities
and
scholarly
characteristics
of
his
later
dramatic
work
nor
is
dante
rossetti
himself
in
some
of
his
poems
free
from
the
same
taint
despite
the
fact
of
his
interesting
individuality
as
the
chief
inspirer
and
laborer
among
the
brotherhood
yet
the
movement
owed
much
to
both
his
brush
and
his
pen
of
other
and
nobler
because
reverential
work
as
those
will
admit
who
know
the
blessed
damozel
sister
helen
and
his
fine
collection
of
sonnets
the
house
of
life
as
well
as
his
famous
paintings
the
girlhood
of
mary
virgin
and
his
annunciation
picture
ecce
ancilla
domini
of
the
product
of
other
of
note
such
as
ford
madox
brown
millais
morris
woolner
the
sculptor
coventry
patmore
and
holman
hunt
much
that
is
commendable
as
well
as
finely
imaginative
came
from
their
hands
and
justified
ruskin
in
his
gallant
advocacy
of
the
movement
its
founders
and
their
work
by
this
time
of
which
we
have
been
writing
ruskin
had
reached
the
early
meridian
of
his
powers
and
as
we
have
hinted
had
wrested
from
the
unwilling
many
a
juster
recognition
of
his
amazing
industry
and
genius
to
his
fond
and
indulgent
parents
this
was
a
great
source
of
pride
and
satisfaction
and
the
practical
evidence
of
it
was
the
throng
of
visitors
to
the
family
seats
of
herne
hill
and
denmark
hill
in
the
then
london
suburbs
where
ruskin
long
had
his
home
and
by
the
attentions
and
honor
paid
to
their
son
by
universities
academies
and
public
bodies
as
well
as
by
many
eminent
personages
and
the
intellectual
of
the
nation
among
those
with
whom
the
young
celebrity
was
then
ultimate
and
reckoned
among
his
admiring
correspondents
were
besides
turner

died

by

in

to

he

famous

and
a
vast
and

and

and

of

we
get
many
delightful
reminiscences
in

with
entertaining
talks
of
his
childhood
days
his
youthful
companions
his
toys
and
animate

his
early
playful
adventures
in
authorship
and
other
garrulities
with
which
late
in
life
when
the
work
as
it
remains
was
incompletely
put
together
he
beguiled
the
weariness
and
feebleness
of
old
age
but
we
are
anticipating
for
we
are
writing
of
ruskin
when
his
hand
was
yet
on
the
plough
and
the
plough
was
still
in
the
furrow
and
half
a
long
life
arduous
work
was
yet
before
him
at
this
era
no
brain
could
well
have
been
more
active
or
fuller
of
philanthropies
than
his
for
we
approach
the
second
period
of
his
life
grand
activities
the
era
of
a
new
departure
in
the
interests
that
occupied
him
and
the
herculean
tasks
he
set
himself
to
do
before
recording
some
of
the
achievements
of
this
time
and
glancing
at
the
inciting
causes
of
the
transition
which
marks
the
era
we
have
now
reached
let
us
note
the
demands
made
upon
ruskin
thought
and
labor
by
universities
and
public
institutions
whose
audiences
desired
to
have
him
appear
before
them
in
person
and
address
them
upon
topics
in
which
he
and
they
were
interested
these
appearances
on
the
lecture
platform
were
now
numerous
since
many
throughout
the
kingdom
were
eager
to
see
and
know
the
man
whose
art
criticisms
principles
that
govern
the
beautiful
and
stimulating
thought
on
all
subjects
had
made
so
deep
an
impression
on
the
reflecting
minds
of
the
age
his
earliest
appearance
on
the
rostrum
was
at
edinburgh
where
he
delivered
four
lectures
before
the
philosophical
institution
chiefly
on
and
on
christian
art
with
a
plea
for
the
use
of
gothic
in
domestic
architecture
subsequent
appearances
were
at
manchester
where
he
spoke
on
the
political
economy
of
art
and
the
relation
of
art
to
manufactures
at
the
south
kensington
museum
london
which
had
just
been
opened
and
later
at
oxford
where
further
on
in
his
career
he
became
slade
professor
of
art
in
his
own
university
from
the
accounts
of
these
public
lectures
we
get
opinions
as
to
the
personal
appearance
of
ruskin
at
the
period
which
add
to
our
knowledge
of
him
from
paintings
drawings
and
photographs
though
not
a
few
of
these
accounts
vary
from
those
given
us
in
books
chiefly
sketched
by
his
lady
friends
and
correspondents
the
more
trusty
of
the
contemporary
pictures
speak
of
him
as
having
light
hair
his
face
more
red
than
pale
the
mouth
well
cut
with
a
good
deal
of
decision
in
its
curve
though
somewhat
wanting
in
sustained
dignity
and
strength
an
aquiline
nose
his
forehead
by
no
means
broad
or
massive
but
the
brows
full
and
well
bound
together
the
eye
says
the
observer
from
whom
we
are
quoting
we
could
not
see
in
consequence
of
the
shadows
that
fell
upon
his
ruskin
countenance
from
the
lights
overhead
but
we
are
sure
that
the
poetry
and
passion
we
looked
for
almost
in
vain
in
other
features
must
be
concentrated
here
miss
mitford
speaks
of
him
at
this
time
as
eloquent
and
fair
and
slender
with
a
gentle
playfulness
and
a
sort
of
pretty
waywardness
that
was
quite
charming
another
a
visitor
at
his
london
home
characterizes
him
as
emotional
and
nervous
with
a
soft
genial
eye
a
mouth
thin
and
severe
and
a
voice
that
though
rich
and
sweet
yet
had
a
tendency
to
sink
into
a
plaintive
and
hopeless
tone
later
on
in
years
we
have
this
verbal
portrait
from
a
disciple
of
the
great
occurring
in
an
inaugural
address
delivered
before
the
ruskin
society
of
glasgow
that
spare
stooping
figure
the
kindly
face
with
its
mobile
sensitive
mouth
and
clear
deep
eyes
so
sweet
and
honest
in
repose
so
keen
and
earnest
and
eloquent
in
debate
when
the
fifth
and
last
volume
of
modern
painters
was
finally
off
his
hands
ruskin
not
only
engaged
as
we
have
seen
in
occasional
lecturing
but
began
to
add
a
prolific
series
of
many
of
them
with
quaint
but
significant
titles
to
his
already
stupendous
mass
of
writing
their
subjects
were
not
alone
aesthetics
but
now
treated
of
ethical
social
and
political
questions
the
prophetic
declarations
and
earnest
appeals
of
a
man
of
wide
and
varied
culture
deep
thought
and
large
experience
the
attempted
alliance
of
political
economy
with
art
was
a
novel
undertaking
in
that
sixth
lustrum
of
the
past
century
even
by
a
man
of
eminence
and
fame
in
the
world
of
letters
but
ruskin
was
a
bold
and
earnest
man
as
well
as
a
genius
and
he
had
too
much
to
tell
his
heedless
age
to
keep
silent
on
themes
remote
as
they
were
from
those
he
had
hitherto
taught
and
of
which
he
desired
to
deliver
his
soul
whatever
ridicule
it
might
provoke
and
however
adverse
the
criticism
levelled
against
him
his
humanity
and
moral
sense
were
outraged
by
the
manner
in
which
the
mass
of
his
countrymen
lived
and
trenchant
was
his
castigation
of
this
and
eager
as
well
as
righteous
his
desire
to
amend
their
condition
and
elevate
and
inspire
their
minds
as
an
economist
it
is
true
there
was
not
a
little
that
was
false
as
well
as
eccentric
in
what
he
preached
moreover
much
of
his
counsel
was
directly
socialistic
in
its
trend
repugnant
in
large
degree
to
his
english
readers
and
hearers
but
all
this
was
atoned
for
by
the
honesty
and
philanthropy
of
his
motives
by
his
phenomenal
fervor
and
eloquence
and
by
the
literary
beauty
and
charm
of
every
page
he
wrote
nevertheless
as
in
carlyle
for
in
these
depreciations
the
style
of
the
seer
of
chelsea
was
deeply
upon
him
the
note
of
calamity
and
the
wail
of
despair
are
too
much
in
evidence
in
ruskin
writings
at
this
period
while
like
carlyle
also
he
was
equally
precipitate
and
impulsive
in
his
attacks
on
things
as
they
were
yet
in
the
economic
condition
just
then
of
england
and
in
the
circumstances
environing
the
labor
world
there
was
possibly
justification
for
the
rebukes
and
objurgations
of
onlookers
of
the
type
of
both
of
these
men
and
very
humanitarian
as
well
as
practically
helpful
were
ruskin
counsel
and
aid
to
labor
and
to
all
who
sought
to
raise
and
expand
their
outlook
and
better
their
condition
in
life
towards
politics
ruskin
was
never
drawn
but
had
he
been
more
prosaic
and
less
given
to
anathematizing
most
valuable
would
have
been
his
aid
in
legislation
at
this
era
of
political
and
moral
reform
but
if
political
science
or
science
in
any
other
of
its
branches
or
departments
did
not
come
within
his
purview
great
was
the
revolution
he
wrought
in
the
surroundings
and
immense
the
illumination
he
shed
upon
industry
and
on
the
spirit
in
which
the
laborer
should
think
and
work
referring
to
ruskin
at
this
period
of
his
career
and
to
his
influence
as
a
social
and
moral
exhorter
frederic
harrison
from
whom
we
have
already
quoted
has
an
admirable
passage
on
ruskin
as
prophet
which
as
it
is
presumably
too
little
known
we
take
pleasure
in
embodying
in
these
pages
footnote
tennyson
ruskin
mill
and
other
literary
estimates
by
frederic
harrison
london
and
new
york
macmillan
co
the
influence
of
ruskin
says
harrison
has
been
part
of
the
great
romantic
historical
catholic
and
poetic
revival
of
which
scott
carlyle
coleridge
freeman
newman
and
tennyson
in
our
own
country
have
been
leading
spirits
within
the
last
two
generations
in
england
there
is
no
need
to
compare
him
with
any
one
of
these
as
a
source
of
original
intellectual
force
he
owns
scott
and
carlyle
as
his
masters
and
he
might
vehemently
repudiate
certain
of
the
others
altogether
his
work
has
been
to
put
this
romantic
historical
and
genuine
sympathy
inspired
by
scott
wordsworth
and
carlyle
into
a
new
understanding
of
the
arts
of
form
the
philosophic
impulse
assuredly
was
not
his
own
it
is
a
compound
of
scott
carlyle
dante
and
the
bible
the
compound
is
strange
for
it
makes
him
talk
sometimes
like
a
puritan
father
and
sometimes
like
a
cistercian
monk
at
times
he
talks
as
flora
macivor
talked
to
young
waverley
at
other
times
like
thomas
carlyle
inditing
a
pamphlet
but
to
transfuse
into
this
modern
generation
of
englishmen
this
romantic
catholic
historical
and
social
sympathy
as
applied
to
the
arts
of
form
needed
gifts
that
neither
scott
nor
carlyle
nor
newman
nor
tennyson
possessed
the
eye
if
not
the
hand
of
a
consummate
landscape
painter
a
torrent
of
ready
eloquence
on
every
imaginable
topic
a
fierce
and
desperate
courage
that
feared
neither
man
nor
devil
neither
failure
nor
ridicule
and
above
all
things
an
exquisite
tenderness
that
is
akin
to
francis
or
vincent
de
paul
here
is
a
man
who
laboring
for
fifty
years
has
scattered
broadcast
a
thousand
fine

to
all
who
practise
the
arts
and
all
who
care
for
art
he
has
roused
in
the
cultured
world
an
interest
in
things
of
art
such
as
a
legion
of
painters
and
ten
royal
academies
could
never
have
done
he
has
poured
out
a
torrent
of
words
some
right
some
wrong
but
such
as
have
raised
the
level
of
art
into
a
new
world
which
have
adorned
english
literature
for
centuries
and
have
inspired
the
english
race
for
generations
he
has
cast
his
bread
upon
the
waste
and
muddy
waters
with
a
lavish
hand

has
not
waited
to
find
it
again

it

speaking
of
what
ruskin
sought
to
accomplish
in
the
regeneration
of
modern
society
and
the
reformation
of
our
social
ideals
and
of
that
heroic
piece
of
quixotism
he
founded
the
guild
of
george
harrison
remarks
the
first
life
of
john
ruskin
was
the
life
of
a
consummate
teacher
of
art
and
master
of
style
the
second
life
was
the
life
of
priest
and
evangelist
here
is
the
greatest
living
master
the
passage
was
written
while
ruskin
was
yet
alive
of
the
english
tongue
one
of
the
most
splendid
lights
of
our
noble
literature
one
to
whom
a
dozen
paths
of
ambition
and
power
lay
open
who
had
everything
that
could
be
offered
by
genius
fame
wealth
social
popularity
and
intense
sensitiveness
to
all
lovely
things
and
this
man
after
thirty
years
of
untiring
labor
devotes
himself
to
train
teach
delight
and
inspire
a
band
of
young
men
girls
workmen
children
all
who
choose
to
come
around
him
he
lavishes
the
whole
of
his
fortune
on
them
he
brings
to
their
door
his
treasures
of
art
science
literature
and
poetry
he
founds
and
endows
museums
he
offers
these
costly
and
precious
collections
to
the
people
he
wears
out
his
life
in
teaching
them
the
elements
of
art
the
elements
of
manufacture
the
elements
of
science
he
shows
workmen
how
to
work
girls
how
to
draw
to
sing
to
play
he
gives
up
to
them
his
wealth
his
genius
his
peace
his
whole
life
he
is
not
content
with
writing
books
in
his
study
with
enjoying
art
at
home
or
abroad
he
must
carry
his
message
into
the
streets
he
gives
himself
up
not
to
write
beautiful
thoughts
he
seeks
to
build
up
a
beautiful
world
when
i
see
this
author
of
painters
and
the
of
venice
the
man
who
has
exhausted
almost
all
that
europe
contains
of
the
beautiful
who
has
thought
and
spoken
of
almost
every
phase
of
human
life
and
has
entered
so
deeply
into
the
highest
mysteries
of
the
greatest
poets
when
i
see
him
surrounding
himself
in
his
old
age
with
lads
and
lasses
schoolgirls
and
workmen
teaching
them
the
elements
of
science
and
art
reading
to
them
poems
and
tales
arranging
for
them
games
and
holidays
ornaments
and
dresses
lavishing
on
these
young
people
his
genius
and
his
wealth
his
fame
and
his
future
i
confess
my
memory
goes
back
instinctively
to
a
fresco
i
saw
in
italy
years
ago
was
it
luini
wherein
the
master
sat
in
a
crowd
of
children
and
forbade
them
to
be
removed
saying
that
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
with
this
generous
tribute
to
and
appreciation
of
ruskin
despite
the
economic
vagaries
into
which
the
great
critic
and
teacher
of
his
time
fell
we
may
more
confidently
approach
the
busy
era
of
his
later
and
labors
and
with
less
apology
take
space
to
deal
as
compactly
and
intelligently
as
we
can
with
some
of
the
more
notable
of
the
many
books
and
of
the
period
difficult
as
would
be
the
task
fortunately
there
is
little
need
to
epitomize
these
works
as
many
of
them
are
better
known
and
perhaps
more
attentively
read
than
his
earlier
bulkier
and
more
ambitious
writings
a
few
of
them
lie
outside
the
economic
gospel
of
their
apostolic
author
and
these
we
will
first
and
briefly
deal
with
a
number
of
them
are
instructive
and
inspiring
lay
sermons
on
the
mystical
union
between
nature
and
art
beauty
and
utility
and
their
reflex
in
the
reverential
homage
for
the
beautiful
and
the
worthy
in
the
mind
and
character
of
the
race
the
whole
form
a
great
body
of
fine
and
thoughtful
work
which
is
as
enchaining
as
its
meaning
is
often
profound
the
of
these
lay
sermons
is
the
queen
of
the
air

splendid
blending
of
his
fancy
with
the
greek

cloud
and
storm
represented
by
athena
goddess
of
the

of
the
earth
and
of

their

antagonized
political
ethics
with
which
in
drawing
this
essay
to
a
close
we
now
venture
to
deal
after
the
magnificent
work
done
by
ruskin
in
art
up
to
his
fortieth
year
that
he
should
turn
for
practically
the
remainder
of
his
life
to
the
seemingly
vain
and
profitless
task
of
a
social
reformer
and
regenerator
of
modern
society
has
to
most
men
been
a
riddle
too
elusive
and
enigmatic
to
solve
and
yet
in
his
earlier
career
had
he
not
himself
prepared
us
for
just
such
a
departure
as
he
took
in
the
sixties
for
in
art
was
he
not
equally
revolutionary
and
iconoclastic
as
well
as
personally
passionate
and
impulsive
moreover
had
not
mother
nature
endowed
him
with
the
gifts
of
a
seer
and
made
him
chivalrous
as
well
as
intensely
sympathetic
while
his
early
training
inclined
him
to
be
serious
and
even
ascetic
nor
were
the
rebuffs
he
met
with
throughout
his
career
calculated
at
this
stage
to
make
him
court
the
applause
of
his
or
be
mindful
of
the
censure
or
approval
nor
can
one
well
quarrel
with
what
he
had
now
to
say
on
many
a
subject
visionary
and
enthusiast
as
he
always
was
and
given
over
to
mediaeval
views
and
preachments
and
to
abounding
moral
and
ethical
exhortation
like
carlyle
his
voice
was
that
of
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
and
yet
in
the
industrial
and
social
condition
of
britain
at
the
era
there
was
need
of
just
such
appeals
for
regeneration
and
reform
as
ruskin
strenuously
uttered
accompanied
by
indignant
rebukes
of
grossness
vulgarity
and
meanness
as
manifested
in
masses
of
the
people
if
in
his
strivings
after
amelioration
he
was
too
denunciatory
as
well
as
too
radical
we
must
remember
the
temper
and
manner
of
the
man
and
recognize
how
difficult
it
was
in
him
or
in
any
iconoclast
who
scorned
modern
science
as
ruskin
scorned
it
to
reconcile
the
age
of
steam
and
industrial
machinery
which
he
spurned
and
would
have
none
of
with
the
views
he
held
of
christianity
morals
and
faith
his
views
on
political
economy
which
he
treated
neither
as
an
art
nor
a
science
might
be
perverse
and
and
his
method
of
adapting
prophetic
and
apostolic
principles
to
the
practice
of
life
utterly
impracticable
but
the
virtues
he
counselled
the
nation
to
manifest
and
the
graces
he
enjoined
of
truthfulness
justice
temperance
bravery
and
obedience
were
qualities
needed
to
be
cultivated
in
his
time
with
a
fuller
recognition
of
and
firmer
trust
in
god
and
his
right
of
sway
in
the
world
he
had
created
what
ruskin
economic
views
were
and
what
his
relations
to
the
industrial
and
social
problems
of
his
time
most
readers
of
our
author
know
are
mainly
to
be
found
in
fors
clavigera
a
series
of
letters
to
covering
the
years
and
in
his
early
essays
on
political
economy
unto
this
last
and
munera
pulveris
unto
this
last
appeared
in
its
original
form
in
the
pages
of
the
cornhill
magazine
then
edited
by
thackeray
and
our
author
speaks
confidently
of
it
as
embodying
his
maturest
and
worthiest
thoughts
on
social
science
the
work
which
will
be
found
the
key
to
economic
gospel
embraces
four
essays
treating
successively
of
the
responsibilities
and
duties
of
those
called
to
fill
all
offices
of
national
trust
and
service
of
the
true
sources
of
a
nation
riches
of
the
right
distribution
of
such
riches
and
of
what
is
meant
by
the
economic
terms
value
wealth
price
and
produce
under
these
several
heads
ruskin
expresses
his
conviction
that
and
government
are
in
all
things
the
law
of
life
while
the
deadly
things
are
competition
and
anarchy
whatever
errors
the
book
contains
and
the
author
unconscious
arrogance
and
dogmatism
made
him
blind
to
them
his
views
were
set
forth
with
his
accustomed
vigor
and
eloquence
and
in
the
honest
belief
that
he
was
more
than
fundamentally
right
it
was
for
such
helpful
work
as
this
and
what
he
accomplished
in
the
kindred
volume
munera
pulveris
which
first
appeared
in
fraser
magazine
that
ruskin
for
the
time
dropped
his
revelations
in
art
to
let
a
new
world
of
thought
into
the
dismal
science
of
political
economy
confound
its
instructors
and
gird
at
the
evils
of
the
age
the
greed
selfishness
and
petty
bargaining
spirit
of
industrial
and
commercial
life
nor
in
conducting
such
a
crusade
as
this
was
ruskin
abandoning
his
old
and
less
controverted
gospel
of
art
he
was
but
carrying
into
new
and
barren
fields
the
high
ideals
he
had
hitherto
counselled
his
age
to
emulate
and
heed
and
in
his
sympathy
with
labor
seeking
to
bring
into
its
world
the
comeliness
of
beauty
and
the
cheer
of
prosperity
comfort
and
happiness
in
time
and
tide
and
more
at
length
in
fors
clavigera
ruskin
reiterates
his
message
to
labor
to
get
rid
of
misery
by
realizing
what
are
the
true
sources
of
happiness
pleasure
in
sincere
and
honest
work
inspired
by
intelligence
culture
religion
and
right
living
what
he
desires
for
the
he
desires
also
for
his
family
and
consequently
he
urges
parents
to
train
their
sons
and
daughters
to
see
and
love
the
beautiful
to
cultivate
their
higher
instincts
and
call
forth
and
feed
their
souls
in
all
this
there
is
much
helpful
tonic
thought
which
the
church
or
the
nation
roused
to
zeal
and
earnest
activity
might
fittingly
teach
and
so
advance
the
material
weal
of
the
people
extend
the
area
of
public
enlightenment
and
morality
and
herald
the
dawn
of
a
new
and
higher
civilization

these

afterwards
appeared

hints
at
the
gist

the

tells
us
that

xx
other
aspects
of
ruskin
economic
gospel
are
unfortunately
not
so
sane
and
beneficent
his
altruism
knows
no
bounds
as
his
philanthropy
and
zeal
have
but
few
restraints
after
the
fashion
of
his
mentor
carlyle
he
is
carried
away
by
his
humanitarianism
and
his
unreserved
acceptance
of
the
doctrine
of
the
equality
and
brotherhood
of
man
hence
come
his
economic
heresies
in
regard
to
rent
and
interest
and
capital
and
usury
his
denunciations
of
the
division
of
labor
his
tolstoian
impoverishment
of
himself
for
the
benefit
of
his
and
his
dictum
that
the
wealth
of
the
nation
should
be
its
own
and
not
accrue
to
the
individual
hence
also
the
wholly
ideal
state
of
society
he
attempted
to
realize
in
his
communal
guild
of
george
with
its
rigid
government
and
restraints
upon
the
personal
liberty
of
its
members
ideally
beautiful
admittedly
was
the
plan
and
scheme
of
the
little
state
with
its
disciplinings
exactions
and
devout
selective
creed
but
the
age
is
a
practical
unimaginative
one
and
whatever
compacts
men
make
even
for
their
highest
welfare
there
are
it
is
to
be
feared
few
so
loyal
tractable
and
docile
as
to
place
themselves
for
long
under
such
tutoring
and
fashioning
forms
of
living
into
whatever
millennial
state
ruskin
sought
to
usher
his
little
band
of
english
followers
and
disciples
one
must
speak
appreciatively
of
his
motives
in
projecting
the
scheme
and
of
the
money
and
labor
he
personally
lavished
upon
the
utopian
project
reverently
also
must
one
speak
of
the
catholic
creed
to
which
its
members
were
asked
to
subscribe
namely
to
trust
in
god
recognize
the
nobleness
of
human
nature
labor
faithfully
with
one
might
be
loyal
to
one
common
country
its
laws
and
its
monarch
or
ruler
orders
so
far
as
they
are
consistent
with
the
higher
law
of
god
while
exacting
obedience
and
a
pledge
that
one
will
not
deceive
either
for
gain
or
other
motive
will
not
rob
will
not
hurt
any
living
creature
nor
destroy
any
beautiful
thing
and
will
honor
one
own
body
by
proper
care
for
it
for
the
joy
and
peace
of
life
all
this
is
very
exemplary
and
beautiful
and
not
to
live
up
to
though
the
of
sheffield
in
time
wearied
of
the
organization
and
the
guild
and
its
noble
ideals
is
now
we
believe
but
a
memory
if
we
except
the
art
museum
and
library
of
the
order
taken
over
and
still
maintained
by
the
town
more
practical
may
we
not
say
than
this
imitation
of
the
florentine
of
the
middle
ages
was
the
working
men
college
founded
in
london
in
the
fifties
by
that
other
earnest
christian
socialist
maurice
in
which
ruskin
lectured
gratuitously
took
charge
of
the
drawing
classes
and
hied
off
to
the
country
with
its
members
to
sketch
from
nature
and
otherwise
instruct
and
entertain
them
yet
good
in
many
respects
came
of
the
guild
of
george
in
the
impulse
it
gave
to
the
revival
of
the
then
dormant
industries
such
as
the
of
linen
of
carpets
and
woollen
fabrics
and
besides
the
stimulus
it
gave
with
the
infusion
of
higher
ideals
of
workmanship
to
the
decorative
arts
and
the
improvement
in
the
sightliness
of
factories
and
in
the
homes
and
surroundings
of
labor
here
ruskin
philanthropy
and
reform
zeal
showed
themselves
most
worthily
in
the
financial
aid
he
gave
in
the
pulling
down
in
crowded
districts
of
the
british
metropolis
of
poor
tenements
and
the
building
up
in
their
place
of
clean
attractive
and
wholesome
habitations
in
such
benevolences
and
and
in
this
life
of
renunciation
and
ruskin
spent
himself
and
made
serious
inroads
into
his
bodily
health
and
strength
as
well
as
scattered
the
fortune
about
a
million
dollars
left
him
by
his
now
deceased
father
but
this
was
the
manner
and
character
of
ruskin
and
this
the
mode
of
expressing
his
love
for
his
which
in
myriad
ways
showed
itself
throughout
a
long
and
strenuous
career
of
devotion
to
high
ideals
and
of
practical
tender
help
in
all
good
works
in
all
his
philanthropies
he
was
true
to
his
own
preachings
and
counsellings
spending
and
being
spent
in
the
spirit
of
his
divine
master
his
whole
soul
aglow
with
reverence
and
adoration
and
tender
with
a
profound
moral
emotion
besides
his
rare
endowments
as
a
lover
of
the
beautiful
he
had
that
other
precious
gift
of
golden
speech
which
threw
a
mantle
of
loveliness
over
every
book
he
wrote
and
perpetual
lustre
over
the
domain
of
letters
ruskin
declining
years
while
hallowed
by
suffering
were
cheered
by
many
tender
attentions
and
unexpected
kindnesses
and
by
the
recognition
by
many
notable
public
bodies
and
eminent
contemporaries
of
his
long
life
of
great
service
and
devotion
to
his
kind
in
our
modern
age
from
which
in
his
loved
coniston
home
he
passed
from
life
no
one
more
reverently
than
he
has
looked
deeper
into
the
mystery
of
life
thought
more
concernedly
of
its
problems
shed
more
passionately
and
eloquently
about
him
love
for
the
beautiful
or
practically
and
helpfully
done
more
layman
only
though
he
was
for
religion
and
humanity
at
his
death
the
nation
paid
honor
to
his
memory
by
offering
his
remains
a

but
ruskin
had
himself
otherwise
ordered
the
disposal
of
his
body
bury

he
said
at
coniston
and
there
on
the
fifth
day
after
his
falling
softly
asleep
amid
a
concourse
of
loving
friends
the
earthly
tenement
of
the
great
art
critic
and
lover
of
righteousness
was
laid
to
rest
his
grave
strewn
with
myriad
wreaths
garlands
and
crosses
of
beautiful
bright
flowers
here
after
his
long
strenuous
militant
career
do
we
leave
this
inspiring
teacher
and
consecrated
priest
of
the
ideal
his
gentle
soul
finding
rest
and
peace
after
the
myriad
troubles
and
tumults
of
life
still
now
is
the
once
active
fertile
stimulating
mind
of
the
man
who
so
effectively
roused
his
generation
from
its
complacent
smugness
and
indifference
in
its
appreciation
of
the
beautiful
and
with
ardent
boldness
challenged
established
beliefs
in
art
and
defied
the
conventionality
and
authority
of
his
time
his
has
been
a
powerful
force
in
innumerable
departments
of
human
thought
and
the
influence
he
has
exerted
in
giving
to
the
world
new
ideals
of
the
beautiful
and
in
shaping
modern
opinion
and
taste
in
art
how
great
is
the
work
he
has
done
and
what
a
library
of
stimulating
inspiring
books
he
has
left
us
comparatively
few
realize
as
they
little
realize
what
the
age
owes
to
him
for
his
noble
activities
in
and
his
many
and
impressive
lessons
and
influence
in
a
commonplace
commercial
time
how
stimulating
as
well
as
ardent
have
been
his
appeals
for
sensitiveness
of
perception
in
regard
to
art
and
of
the
tone
and
spirit
in
which
it
ought
to
be
viewed
and
valued
and
with
what
tender
reverent
feeling
has
he
not
opened
our
hearts
to
compassion
and
to
consideration
for
the
welfare
of
our
and
how
potent
have
been
his
counsellings
pointing
to
the
true
and
abiding
sources
of
pleasure
in
life
long
must
his
formative
opinions
and
influence
extend
and
in
the
minds
of
all
who
think
and
reflect
abiding
must
be
the
charm
as
well
as
the
power
of
his
imaginative
glowing
thought
that
he
met
with
opposition
and
hostility
in
his
day
was
but
the
price
to
be
paid
for
the
disturbing
correcting
disciplining
yet
inspiring
part
he
played
in
the
work
he
so
impulsively
set
himself
to
do
one
smiles
now
at
the
epithets
of
scorn
and
contumely
once
hurled
at
him
at
the
man
who
little
understood
as
he
has
been
has
done
so
much
to
uplift
and
purify
the
thought
of
his
time
and
do
battle
with
the
forces
opposed
to
reform
and
arrayed
against
those
of
light
and
truth
and
how
great
were
the
weapons
with
which
he
was
armed
and
how
varied
as
well
as
marvellous
the
talents
he
brought
into
play
in
the
onslaught
upon
shallowness
convention
and
ignorance
truly
he
has
done
much
for
his
time
and
great
has
been
the
gain
modern
art
has
won
from
his
inspiring
lessons
and
thought
the
coming
of
such
a
man
and
at
the
time
that
was
his
one
can
not
help
reflecting
was
one
of
the
providences
of
an
overruling
power
and
adequately
to
estimate
his
influence
and
work
and
the
tone
and
temper
in
which
he
wrought
we
have
but
to

an

herbert
spencer
the
evolutionary
philosophy
by
mayo
hazeltine
herbert
spencer
occupies
a
unique
place
in
the
history
of
human
thought
because
he
has
been
the
first
to
attempt
the
construction
of
a
philosophical
system
in
harmony
with
the
theory
of
evolution
and
with
the
results
of
modern
science
to
his
contemporaries
he
is
known
almost
exclusively
as
the
author
of
the
colossal
work
which
he
has
chosen
to
call
the
synthetic
philosophy
concerning
his
personality
very
little
information
has
been
published
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
will
deem
it
worth
while
to
leave
behind
him
the
materials
for
a
detailed
biography
about
his
private
life
we
know
even
less
than
we
know
about
that
of
kant
the
very
few
facts
obtainable
may
be
summed
up
in
a
score
of
sentences
herbert
spencer
was
born
on
april
at
derby
in
england
and
was
an
only
surviving
child
his
father
was
a
schoolmaster
in
the
town
named
and
secretary
of
a
philosophical
society
from
him
the
son
seems
to
have
imbibed
the
love
of
natural
science
and
the
faculty
of
observation
conspicuous
in
his
work
the
father
was
particularly
interested
in
entomology
and
spencer
himself
used
to
collect
describe
and
draw
insects
when
a
boy
at
the
age
of
thirteen
he
was
sent
to
study
with
an
uncle
rev
thomas
spencer
a
liberal
clergyman
and
a
scholar
with
whom
he
remained
three
years
carrying
on
the
study
of
natural
history
which
he
had
begun
in
childhood
he
now
devoted
himself
to
mathematics
evincing
a
singular
capacity
for
working
out
original
problems
at
this
time
too
he
became
familiar
with
physical
and
chemical
investigations
and
already
exhibited
a
strong
tendency
to
experimental
inquiry
and
original
research
his
aversion
to
linguistic
studies
put
a
university
career
out
of
the
question
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
entered
the
office
of
sir
charles
fox
and
began
work
as
a
civil
engineer
but
about
eight
years
afterward
he
gave
up
this
profession
and
devoted
the
whole
of
his
time
to
scientific
experiments
and
studies
and
to
contributions
on
philosophical
questions
to
various
periodicals
as
early
as
in
a
series
of
letters
to
the
nonconformist
newspaper
on
the
proper
sphere
of
government
he
propounded
a
belief
in
human
progress
based
on
the
modifiability
of
human
nature
through
adaptation
to
its
social
surroundings
and
he
asserted
the
tendency
of
these
social
arrangements
to
assume
of
themselves
a
condition
of
stable
equilibrium
from
to
he
was
of
the
economist
newspaper
and
in
his
first
important
work
social
statics
published
in
he
developed
the
ethical
and
sociological
ideas
which
had
been
set
forth
in
his
published
letters
the
truth
that
all
organic
development
is
a
change
from
a
state
of
homogeneity
to
a
state
of
heterogeneity
is
regarded
by
spencer
as
the
organizing
principle
of
his
subsequent
beliefs
it
was
gradually
expounded
and
applied
by
him
in
a
series
of
articles
contributed
to
the
north
british
the
british
quarterly
the
westminster
and
other
reviews
in
these
essays
and
especially
in
the
volume
of
principles
of
psychology
published
in
the
doctrine
of
evolution
began
to
take
definite
form
and
to
be
applied
to
various
departments
of
inquiry
it
was
not
until
four
years
later
a
fact
to
be
carefully
borne
in
mind
by
those
who
would
estimate
correctly
the
relation
of
spencer
to
darwin
that
the
publication
of
the
latter
origin
of
species
afforded
a
wide
basis
of
scientific
truth
for
what
had
hitherto
been
matter
of
speculation
and
demonstrated
the
important
part
played
by
natural
selection
in
the
development
of
organisms
as
early
as
march
spencer
issued
a
prospectus
in
which
he
set
forth
the
general
aim
and
scope
of
a
series
of
works
which
were
to
be
issued
in
periodical
parts
and
would
collectively
constitute
a
system
of
philosophy
in
appeared
the
first
principles
and
in
the
principles
of
biology
in
the
principles
of
psychology
was
published
the
first
part
of
the
principles
of
ethics
in
and
his
principles
of
sociology
in
three
volumes
begun
in
was
completed
in
in
the
preface
to
the
third
volume
of
the
work
the
author
explains
that
the
fourth
volume
originally
contemplated
which
was
to
deal
with
the
linguistic
intellectual
moral
and
aesthetic
phenomena
would
have
to
remain
unwritten
by
reason
of
the
author
age
and
infirmities
the
astounding
extent
of
herbert
spencer
labors
becomes
indeed
the
more
marvellous
when
one
considers
that
impaired
health
has
for
many
years
incapacitated
him
for
persistent
application
owing
partly
to
his
ill
health
and
partly
to
the
absorbing
nature
of
his
occupation
his
life
has
been
a
retired
one
and
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
uneventful
he
has
never
married
and
although
the
high
opinion
of
his
writings
formed
by
contemporaries
has
led
to
many
academic
honors
being
pressed
upon
him
at
home
and
abroad
these
have
all
been
declined
it
only
remains
to
mention
that
in
he
visited
the
united
states
where
the
importance
of
his
speculations
had
been
early
recognized
and
that
his
home
is
now
in
brighton
england
ii
in
spencer
latest
book
facts
and
comments
a
little
light
is
thrown
on
the
author
habits
opinions
and
predilections
referring
to
the
athleticism
to
which
so
much
attention
is
paid
just
now
in
english
and
american
universities
he
points
out
how
erroneous
it
is
to
identify
muscular
strength
with
constitutional
strength
not
only
is
there
error
in
assuming
that
increase
of
muscular
power
and
increase
of
general
vigor
necessarily
go
together
but
there
is
error
in
assuming
that
the
reverse
connection
can
not
hold
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
abnormal
powers
acquired
by
gymnasts
may
be
at
the
cost
of
constitutional
deterioration
in
a
paper
on
party
government
the
author
maintains
that
what
we
boast
of
as
political
freedom
consists
in
the
ability
to
choose
a
despot
or
a
group
of
oligarchs
and
after
long
misbehavior
has
produced
dissatisfaction
to
choose
another
despot
or
group
of
oligarchs
having
meanwhile
been
made
subject
to
laws
some
of
which
are
repugnant
abolish
the
existing
conventional
usages
with
respect
to
party
fealty
let
each
member
of
parliament
feel
that
he
may
express
by
his
vote
his
adverse
belief
respecting
a
government
measure
without
endangering
the
government
stability
and
the
whole
vicious
system
of
party
government
would
disappear
in
a
paper
on
patriotism
spencer
says
that
to
him
the
cry
our
country
right
or
wrong
seems
detestable
the
love
of
country
he
adds
is
not
fostered
in
him
by
remembering
that
when
after
england
prime
minister
had
declared
that
englishmen
were
bound
in
honor
to
the
khedive
to
reconquer
the
soudan
they
after
the
reconquest
forthwith
began
to
administer
it
in
the
name
of
the
queen
and
the
khedive
thereby
practically
annexing
it
and
when
after
promising
through
the
mouths
of
two
colonial
ministers
not
to
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
the
transvaal
the
british
government
proceeded
to
insist
on
certain
electoral
arrangements
and
made
resistance
the
excuse
for
a
desolating
war
as
to
the
transparent
pretence
that
the
boers
commenced
the
war
spencer
reminds
us
that
in
the
far
west
of
the
united
states
where
every
man
carries
his
life
in
his
hands
and
the
usages
of
fighting
are
well
understood
it
is
held
that
he
is
the
real
aggressor
who
first
moves
his
hand
toward
his
weapon
the
application
to
the
south
african
contest
is
obvious
in
an
essay
on
style
spencer
tells
us
that
his
own
diction
has
been
from
the
beginning
unpremeditated
it
has
never
occurred
to
him
to
take
any
author
as
a
model
neither
has
he
at
any
time
examined
the
writing
of
this
or
that
author
with
a
view
of
observing
its
peculiarities
the
thought
of
style
considered
as
an
end
in
itself
has
rarely
if
ever
been
present
with
him
his
sole
purpose
being
to
express
ideas
as
clearly
as
possible
and
when
the
occasion
called
for
it
with
as
much
force
as
might
be
he
has
observed
however
he
says
that
some
difference
has
been
made
in
his
style
by
the
practice
of
dictation
up
to
his
books
and
review
articles
were
written
with
his
own
hand
since
then
they
have
all
been
dictated
he
thinks
that
there
is
foundation
for
the
prevailing
belief
that
dictation
is
apt
to
cause
diffuseness
the
remark
was
once
made
to
him
it
seems
by
two
good
judges
george
henry
lewes
and
george
eliot
that
the
style
of
social
statics
is
better
than
the
style
of
his
later
volumes
spencer
would
ascribe
the
contrast
to
the
deteriorating
effect
of
dictation
a
recent
experience
has
strengthened
him
in
this
conclusion
when
lately
revising
first
principles
which
originally
was
dictated
the
cutting
out
of
superfluous
words
clauses
sentences
and
sometimes
paragraphs
had
the
effect
of
abridging
the
work
by
about
touching
the
style
of
other
writers
spencer
points
out
the
defects
in
some
passages
quoted
from
matthew
arnold
and
froude
he
says
that
he
is
repelled
by
the
ponderous
involved
structure
of
milton
prose
and
he
dissents
from
the
applause
of
ruskin
style
on
the
ground
that
it
is
too
and
implies
too
much
thought
of
effect
on
the
other
hand
he
has
always
been
attracted
by
the
finished
naturalness
of
thackeray
a
word
should
here
be
said
about
the
misconception
of
position
with
reference
to
the
fundamental
postulate
of
religions
a
misconception
which
used
to
be
more
current
than
it
is
now
he
can
not
fairly
be
described
as
a
materialist
he
is
no
more
a
materialist
than
he
is
a
theist
he
is
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
an
agnostic
he
was
the
most
conspicuous
example
of
the
before
huxley
invented
the
the
misconception
was
shared
by
no
less
a
man
than
the
late
benjamin
jowett
the
master
of
balliol
college
oxford
who
in
one
of
his
published
letters
says
i
sometimes
think
that
we
platonists
and
idealists
are
not
half
so
industrious
as
those
repulsive
people
who
only
what
they
can
hold
in
their
hand
bain
spencer
who
are
the
very
tuppers
of
philosophy
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
law
of
evolution
and
other
generalizations
of
an
abstract
kind
with
which
spencer
name
is
associated
can
be
held
in
anybody
hands
letting
that
pass
however
spencer
has
himself
suggested
that
since
the
system
of
synthetic
philosophy
begins
with
a
division
entitled
the
unknowable
having
for
its
purpose
to
show
that
all
material
phenomena
are
manifestations
of
a
power
which
transcends
our
knowledge
that
force
as
we
know
it
can
be
regarded
only
as
a
conditioned
effect
of
the
unconditioned
cause
there
has
been
thereby
afforded
sufficiently
decided
proof
of
belief
in
something
which
can
not
be
held
in
the
hands
it
is
indeed
absurd
to
apply
the
epithet
materialist
to
a
man
who
has
written
in
the
principles
of
psychology
hence
though
of
the
two
it
seems
easier
to
translate
matter
into
spirit
than
to
translate
spirit
into
matter
which
latter
is
indeed
wholly
impossible
yet
no
translation
can
carry
us
beyond
our
symbols
iii
any
exposition
of
the
synthetic
philosophy
must
of
course
begin
with
the
volume
entitled
first
principles
in
the
first
part
of
this
preliminary
work
the
author
carries
a
step
further
the
doctrine
of
the
unknowable
put
into
shape
by
hamilton
and
mansel
he
points
out
the
various
directions
in
which
science
leads
to
the
same
conclusion
and
shows
that
in
their
united
belief
in
an
absolute
that
transcends
not
only
human
knowledge
but
human
conception
lies
the
only
possible
reconciliation
of
science
and
religion
in
the
second
part
of
the
same
book
spencer
undertakes
to
formulate
the
laws
of
the
knowable
that
is
to
say
he
essays
to
state
the
ultimate
principles
discernible
throughout
all
manifestations
of
the
absolute
those
highest
generalizations
now
being
disclosed
by
science
such
for
example
as
the
conservation
of
force
which
are
severally
true
not
of
one
class
of
phenomena
but
of
classes
of
phenomena
and
which
are
thus
the
keys
to
all
classes
of
phenomena
the
conclusions
reached
in
first
principles
may
be
thus
summed
up
over
and
over
again
in
the
five
hundred
pages
devoted
to
their
formulation
it
is
shown
in
various
ways
that
the
deepest
truths
we
can
reach
are
simply
statements
of
the
widest
uniformities
in
our
experiences
of
the
relations
of
matter
motion
and
force
and
that
matter
motion
and
force
are
but
symbols
of
the
unknown
reality
a
power
of
which
the
nature
remains
forever
inconceivable
and
to
which
no
limits
in
time
and
space
can
be
imagined
works
in
us
certain
effects
these
effects
have
certain
likenesses
of
kind
the
most
general
of
which
we
class
together
under
the
names
of
matter
motion
and
force
and
between
these
effects
there
are
likenesses
of
connection
the
most
constant
of
which
we
class
as
laws
of
the
highest
certainty
analysis
reduces
these
several
kinds
of
effects
to
one
kind
of
effect
and
these
several
kinds
of
uniformity
to
one
kind
of
uniformity
the
highest
achievement
of
science
is
the
interpretation
of
all
orders
of
phenomena
as
differently
conditioned
manifestations
of
this
one
kind
of
effect
under
differently
conditioned
modes
of
this
one
kind
of
uniformity
when
science
has
done
this
however
it
has
done
nothing
more
than
systematize
our
experiences
and
has
in
no
degree
extended
the
limits
of
our
experiences
we
can
say
no
more
than
before
whether
the
uniformities
are
as
absolutely
necessary
as
they
have
become
to
our
thought
relatively
necessary
the
utmost
possibility
for
us
is
an
interpretation
of
the
process
of
things
as
it
presents
itself
to
our
limited
consciousness
but
how
this
process
is
related
to
the
actual
process
we
are
unable
to
conceive
much
less
to
know
similarly
we
are
admonished
to
remember
that
while
the
connection
between
the
phenomenal
order
and
the
ontological
order
is
forever
inscrutable
so
is
the
connection
between
the
conditioned
forms
of
being
and
the
unconditioned
form
of
being
forever
inscrutable
the
interpretation
of
all
phenomena
in
terms
of
matter
motion
and
force
is
nothing
more
than
the
reduction
of
our
complex
symbols
of
thought
to
the
simplest
symbols
and
when
the
equation
has
been
brought
to
its
lowest
terms
the
symbols
remain
symbols
still
hence
the
reasonings
contained
in
first
principles
afford
no
support
to
either
of
the
antagonist
hypotheses
respecting
the
ultimate
nature
of
things
their
implications
are
no
more
materialistic
than
they
are
spiritualistic
and
no
more
spiritualistic
than
they
are
materialistic
the
establishment
of
correlation
and
equivalence
between
the
forces
of
the
outer
and
the
inner
worlds
serves
to
assimilate
either
to
the
other
according
as
we
set
out
with
one
or
the
other
he
who
rightly
interprets
the
doctrine
propounded
in
first
principles
will
see
that
neither
the
forces
of
the
outer
nor
the
forces
of
the
inner
world
can
be
taken
as
ultimate
he
will
see
that
though
the
relation
of
subject
and
object
renders
necessary
to
us
the
antithetical
conceptions
of
spirit
and
matter
the
one
is
no
less
than
the
other
to
be
regarded
as
but
a
sign
of
the
unknown
reality
which
underlies
both
in
logical
order
the
formulation
of
first
principles
should
have
been
followed
by
the
application
of
them
to
inorganic
nature
this
great
division
of
spencer
subject
is
passed
over
however
partly
because
even
without
it
the
scheme
is
too
extensive
to
be
carried
out
in
the
lifetime
of
one
man
and
partly
because
the
interpretation
of
organic
nature
after
the
proposed
method
is
of
more
immediate
importance
before
noting
how
spencer
applies
his
fundamental
principles
to
the
interpretation
of
the
phenomena
of
life
it
may
be
well
to
put
before
the
reader
eye
the
formula
of
evolution
in
the
author
own
language
evolution
is
an
integration
of
matter
and
concomitant
dissipation
of
motion
during
which
the
matter
passes
from
an
indefinite
incoherent
homogeneity
to
a
definite
coherent
heterogeneity
and
during
which
the
retained
motion
undergoes
a
parallel
transformation
this
law
of
evolution
is
equally
applicable
to
all
orders
of
phenomena
astronomic
geologic
biologic
psychologic
sociologic
since
these
are
all
component
parts
of
one
cosmos
though
disguised
from
one
another
by
conventional
groupings
it
is
obvious
that
so
long
as
evolution
is
merely
established
by
induction
it
belongs
not
to
philosophy
but
to
science
to
belong
to
philosophy
it
must
be
deduced
from
the
persistence
of
force
spencer
holds
that
this
can
be
done
for
any
finite
aggregate
being
unequally
exposed
to
surrounding
forces
will
become
more
diverse
in
structure
every
differentiated
part
will
become
the
parent
of
further
differences
at
the
same
time
dissimilar
units
in
the
aggregate
tend
to
separate
and
those
which
are
similar
to
cluster
together
segregation
and
this
subdivision
and
dissipation
of
forces
so
long
as
there
are
any
forces
unbalanced
by
opposite
forces
must
end
at
last
in
rest
the
penultimate
stage
of
this
process
in
which
the
extremest
multiformity
and
most
complex
moving
equilibrium
are
established
being
the
highest
conceivable
state
the
various
derivative
laws
of
phenomenal
changes
are
thus
deducible
from
the
persistence
of
force
it
remains
to
apply
them
to
inorganic
organic
and
superorganic
existences
the
detailed
treatment
of
inorganic
evolution
is
omitted
as
we
have
said
from
spencer
plan
and
he
proceeds
to
interpret
the
phenomena
of
life
mind
and
society
in
terms
of
matter
motion
and
force
iv
the
first
volume
of
the
principles
of
biology
consists
of
three
parts
the
first
of
which
sets
forth
the
data
of
biology
including
those
general
truths
of
physics
and
chemistry
with
which
rational
biology
must
start
the
second
part
is
allotted
to
the
inductions
of
biology
or
in
other
words
to
a
statement
of
the
leading
generalizations
which
naturalists
physiologists
and
comparative
anatomists
have
established
the
third
and
final
part
of
the
first
volume
of
the
principles
of
biology
deals
with
the
speculation
commonly
known
as
the
development
hypothesis
and
considers
its
and
evidences
the
inductive
evidences
for
the
evolutionary
hypothesis
as
from
the
hypothesis
are
dealt
with
in
four
chapters
the
arguments
from
classification
are
these
organisms
fall
into
groups
within
groups
and
this
is
the
arrangement
which
we
see
results
from
evolution
where
it
is
known
to
take
place
of
these
groups
within
groups
the
great
or
primary
ones
are
the
most
unlike
the
are
less
unlike
the
still
less
unlike
and
so
on
and
this
too
is
a
characteristic
of
groups
demonstrably
produced
by
evolution
moreover
indefiniteness
of
equivalence
among
the
groups
is
common
to
those
which
we
know
have
been
evolved
and
to
those
supposed
in
the
volume
before
us
to
have
been
evolved
there
is
the
further
significant
fact
that
divergent
groups
are
allied
through
their
lowest
rather
than
their
highest
members
of
the
arguments
from
embryology
the
first
is
that
when
developing
embryos
are
traced
from
their
common
and
their
divergencies
and
are
symbolized
by
a
genealogical
tree
there
is
manifest
a
general
parallelism
between
the
arrangement
of
its
primary
secondary
and
tertiary
branches
and
the
arrangement
of
the
divisions
and
subdivisions
of
spencer
classifications
nor
do
the
minor
deviations
from
this
general
parallelism
which
look
like
difficulties
fail
on
closer
observation
to
furnish
additional
evidence
since
those
traits
of
a
common
ancestry
which
embryology
reveals
are
if
modifications
have
resulted
from
changed
conditions
liable
to
be
disguised
in
different
ways
and
degrees
in
different
lines
of
descendants
spencer
next
considers
the
arguments
from
morphology
apart
from
those
kinships
among
organisms
disclosed
by
their
developmental
changes
the
kinships
which
their
adult
forms
show
are
profoundly
significant
the
unities
of
type
found
under
such
different
externals
are
inexplicable
except
as
results
of
community
of
descent
with
of
modification
again
each
organism
analyzed
apart
shows
in
the
likenesses
obscured
by
unlikenesses
of
its
component
parts
a
peculiarity
which
can
be
ascribed
only
to
the
formation
of
a
more
heterogeneous
organism
out
of
a
more
homogeneous
one
and
once
more
the
existence
of
rudimentary
organs
homologous
with
organs
that
are
developed
in
allied
animals
or
plants
while
it
admits
of
no
other
rational
interpretation
is
satisfactorily
interpreted
by
the
hypothesis
of
evolution
last
of
the
inductive
evidences
are
the
arguments
from
distribution
while
the
facts
of
distribution
in
space
are
unaccountable
as
results
of
designed
adaptation
of
organisms
to
their
habitats
they
are
accountable
as
results
of
the
competition
of
species
and
the
spread
of
the
more
fit
into
the
habitats
of
the
less
fit
followed
by
the
changes
which
new
conditions
induce
though
the
facts
of
distribution
in
time
are
so
fragmentary
that
no
positive
conclusion
can
be
drawn
yet
all
of
them
are
reconcilable
with
the
hypothesis
of
evolution
and
some
of
them
yield
strong
support
especially
the
near
relationship
existing
between
the
living
and
extinct
types
in
each
great
geographical
area
thus
of
these
four
categories
of
evidence
each
furnishes
several
arguments
which
point
to
the
same
conclusion
this
coincidence
would
give
to
the
induction
a
very
high
degree
of
probability
even
were
it
not
enforced
by
deduction
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
conclusion
deductively
reached
is
in
harmony
with
the
inductive
conclusion
spencer
has
deductively
shown
that
by
its
lineage
and
its
kindred
the
is
as
closely
allied
with
the
proved
truths
of
modern
science
as
is
the
antagonist
hypothesis
that
of
special
creation
with
the
proved
errors
of
ancient
ignorance
he
has
shown
that
instead
of
being
a
mere
it
admits
of
elaboration
into
a
definite
conception
so
showing
its
legitimacy
as
an
hypothesis
instead
of
positing
a
purely
fictitious
process
the
process
which
it
alleges
proves
to
be
one
actually
going
on
around
us
to
which
may
be
added
that
the
presents
no
radical
incongruities
from
a
moral
point
of
view
on
the
other
hand
the
hypothesis
is
shown
to
be
not
even
a
thinkable
hypothesis
and
while
thus
intellectually
illusive
to
have
moral
implications
irreconcilable
with
the
professed
beliefs
of
those
who
hold
it
passing
from
the
evidence
that
evolution
has
taken
place
to
the
question
how
has
it
taken
place
mr
spencer
finds
in
known
agencies
and
known
processes
adequate
causes
of
its
phenomena
in
astronomic
geologic
and
meteorologic
changes
ever
in
progress
ever
combining
in
new
and
more
involved
ways
we
have
a
set
of
inorganic
factors
to
which
all
organisms
are
exposed
and
in
the
varying
and
complicated
actions
of
organisms
on
one
another
we
have
a
set
of
organic
factors
that
alter
with
increasing
rapidity
thus
speaking
generally
all
members
of
the
earth
flora
and
fauna
experience
perpetual
rearrangements
of
external
forces
each
organic
aggregate
whether
considered
individually
or
as
a
continuously
existing
species
is
modified
afresh
by
each
fresh
distribution
of
external
forces
to
its
differentiations
new
differentiations
are
added
and
thus
that
lapse
to
a
more
heterogeneous
state
which
would
have
a
fixed
limit
were
the
circumstances
fixed
has
its
limits
perpetually
removed
by
the
perpetual
change
of
the
circumstances
these
modifications
upon
modifications
which
result
in
evolution
structurally
considered
are
the
accompaniments
of
those
functional
alterations
continually
required
to
inner
with
outer
actions
that
moving
equilibrium
of
inner
actions
corresponding
with
outer
actions
which
constitutes
the
life
of
an
organism
must
either
be
overthrown
by
a
change
in
the
outer
actions
or
must
undergo
perturbations
that
can
not
end
until
there
is
a
readjusted
balance
of
functions
and
correlative
adaptation
of
structures
but
where
the
external
changes
are
either
such
as
are
fatal
when
experienced
by
the
individuals
or
such
as
act
on
the
individuals
in
ways
that
do
not
affect
the
equilibrium
of
their
functions
then
the
readjustment
results
through
the
effects
produced
on
the
species
as
a
whole
there
is
indirect
equilibration
by
the
preservation
in
successive
generations
of
those
whose
moving
equilibria
are
less
at
variance
with
the
requirements
there
is
produced
a
changed
equilibrium
completely
in
harmony
with
the
requirements
even
were
this
the
whole
of
the
evidence
assignable
for
the
belief
that
organisms
have
been
gradually
evolved
spencer
holds
that
the
belief
would
have
a
warrant
higher
than
is
possessed
by
many
beliefs
which
are
regarded
as
established
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
the
evidence
is
far
from
exhausted
at
the
outset
of
the
first
volume
of
principles
of
biology
it
was
remarked
by
the
author
that
the
phenomena
presented
by
the
organic
world
as
a
whole
can
not
be
properly
dealt
with
apart
from
the
phenomena
presented
by
each
organism
in
the
course
of
its
growth
development
and
decay
the
interpretation
of
either
class
of
phenomena
implies
interpretation
of
the
other
since
the
two
are
in
reality
parts
of
one
process
hence
the
validity
of
any
hypothesis
respecting
the
one
class
of
phenomena
may
be
tested
by
its
congruity
with
phenomena
of
the
other
class
in
the
second
volume
of
the
principles
of
biology
spencer
passes
to
the
more
special
phenomena
of
development
as
displayed
in
the
structures
and
functions
of
individual
organisms
if
the
hypothesis
that
plants
and
animals
have
been
progressively
evolved
be
true
it
must
furnish
us
with
keys
to
these
special
phenomena
spencer
finds
that
the
hypothesis
does
this
and
by
doing
it
gives
numberless
additional
vouchers
for
its
truth
it
is
impossible
for
us
here
to
review
even
in
outline
the
extensive
field
traversed
in
the
second
volume
of
principles
of
biology
we
would
not
omit
however
to
direct
attention
to
the
interesting
conclusion
reached
by
spencer
toward
the
close
of
the
volume
with
regard
to
the
future
of
the
human
race
considered
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
possible
pressure
of
population
upon
subsistence
he
points
out
that
in
man
all
the
equilibrations
between
constitution
and
conditions
between
the
structure
of
society
and
the
nature
of
its
members
between
fertility
and
mortality
advance
simultaneously
towards
a
common
climax
in
approaching
an
equilibrium
between
his
nature
and
the
circumstances
of
his
inorganic
environment
and
in
approaching
an
equilibrium
between
his
nature
and
all
the
requirements
of
the
social
state
man
is
at
the
same
time
approaching
that
lowest
limit
of
fertility
at
which
the
equilibrium
of
population
is
maintained
by
the
addition
of
as
many
infants
as
there
are
subtractions
by
death
next
in
logical
order
and
in
order
of
publication
come
the
two
volumes
collectively
entitled
the
principles
of
psychology
in
these
volumes
an
attempt
is
made
to
trace
objectively
the
evolution
of
mind
from
reflex
action
through
instinct
to
reason
memory
feeling
and
will
from
the
interaction
of
the
nervous
system
with
its
environment
subjectively
mental
states
are
analyzed
and
it
is
contended
that
all
of
them
including
those
primary
scientific
ideas
the
perceptions
of
matter
motion
space
and
time
assumed
in
the
first
principles
can
be
analyzed
into
a
primitive
element
of
consciousness
something
which
can
be
defined
only
as
analogous
to
a
nervous
shock
these
perceptions
have
now
become
innate
in
the
individual
they
may
be
called
as
kant
called
space
and
time
forms
of
intuition
but
they
have
been
acquired
empirically
by
the
race
through
the
persistence
of
the
corresponding
phenomena
in
the
environment
and
from
the
accumulated
experiences
of
each
individual
being
transmitted
in
the
form
of
modified
structure
to
his
descendants
this
principle
of
heredity
is
one
of
the
laws
by
which
individuals
are
connected
with
one
another
into
an
organic
whole
and
we
thus
pass
to
what
spencer
calls
superorganic
evolution
implying
the
actions
of
many
individuals
and
giving
rise
to
the
science
of
sociology
it
is
this
science
which
spencer
undertakes
to
expound
in
the
three
volumes
entitled
the
principles
of
sociology
the
first
of
these
volumes
presents
a
statement
of
the
several
sets
of
factors
entering
into
social
phenomena
these
factors
are
first
human
ideas
and
feelings
considered
in
their
necessary
order
of
evolution
secondly
surrounding
natural
conditions
and
thirdly
those
conditions
to
which
society
itself
gives
origin
under
the
caption
the
inductions
of
sociology
are
set
forth
the
general
facts
structural
and
functional
gathered
from
a
survey
of
societies
and
their
changes
in
other
words
the
empirical
generalizations
that
are
arrived
at
by
comparing
different
societies
or
successive
stages
of
the
same
societies
the
author
then
examines
the
evolution
of
governments
general
and
local
as
this
is
determined
by
natural
causes
their
several
types
and
metamorphosis
their
increasing
complexity
and
specialization
and
the
progressive
limitation
of
their
functions
from
political
the
author
turns
to
ecclesiastical
organization
he
traces
the
differentiation
of
religious
government
from
secular
its
successive
complications
and
the
multiplication
of
sects
the
growth
and
continued
modification
of
religious
ideas
as
caused
by
advancing
knowledge
and
changing
moral
character
and
the
gradual
reconciliation
of
these
ideas
with
the
truths
of
abstract
science
a
good
deal
of
space
is
devoted
to
what
the
author
calls
ceremonial
organization
by
which
he
means
that
third
kind
of
government
which
having
a
common
root
with
the
others
and
slowly
becoming
separate
from
and
supplementary
to
them
serves
to
regulate
the
minor
actions
of
life
finally
spencer
discusses
industrial
organization
that
is
to
say
the
development
of
productive
and
distributive
agencies
considered
in
its
necessary
causes
comprehending
not
only
the
progressive
division
of
labor
and
the
increasing
complexity
of
each
industrial
agency
but
also
the
successive
forms
of
industrial
government
as
passing
through
like
phases
with
political
government
many
pages
would
be
requisite
adequately
to
describe
the
result
of
the
inquiries
prosecuted
by
spencer
during
some
twenty
years
and
embodied
in
the
three
volumes
entitled
principles
of
sociology
the
ultimate
conclusions
reached
however
may
be
summed
up
in
a
few
paragraphs
it
is
the
author
final
conviction
that
if
the
process
of
evolution
which
unceasing
throughout
past
time
has
brought
life
to
its
present
height
continues
throughout
the
future
as
we
can
not
but
anticipate
then
amid
all
the
rhythmical
changes
in
each
society
amid
all
the
lives
and
deaths
of
nations
amid
all
the
supplantings
of
race
by
race
there
will
go
on
that
adaptation
of
human
nature
to
the
social
state
which
began
when
savages
first
gathered
together
into
hordes
for
mutual
defence
an
adaptation
finally
complete
spencer
foresees
that
many
will
think
this
a
wild
imagination
though
everywhere
around
them
are
creatures
with
structures
and
instincts
which
have
been
gradually
so
moulded
as
to
subserve
their
own
welfares
and
the
welfares
of
their
species
yet
the
immense
majority
ignore
the
implication
that
human
beings
too
have
been
undergoing
in
the
past
and
will
undergo
in
the
future
progressive
adjustments
to
the
lives
imposed
on
them
by
circumstances
there
are
a
few
nevertheless
who
think
it
rational
to
conclude
that
what
has
happened
with
all
lower
forms
must
happen
with
the
highest
forms
a
few
who
infer
that
among
types
of
men
those
most
fitted
for
making
a
society
will
hereafter
as
heretofore
from
time
to
time
emerge
and
spread
at
the
expense
of
types
less
fitted
until
a
fully
fitted
type
has
arisen
it
is
at
the
same
time
conceded
that
the
view
thus
suggested
can
not
be
accepted
without
qualification
if
we
carry
our
thoughts
as
far
forward
as
palaeolithic
implements
carry
them
back
we
are
introduced
not
to
an
absolute
optimism
but
to
a
relative
optimism
the
cosmic
process
brings
about
retrogression
as
well
as
progression
where
the
conditions
favor
it
only
amid
an
infinity
of
modifications
adjusted
to
an
infinity
of
changes
of
circumstances
do
there
now
and
then
occur
some
which
constitute
an
advance
other
changes
meanwhile
caused
in
other
organisms
usually
not
constituting
forward
steps
in
organization
and
often
constituting
steps
backward
evolution
does
not
imply
a
latent
tendency
to
improve
everywhere
in
operation
there
is
no
uniform
ascent
from
lower
to
higher
but
only
an
occasional
production
of
a
form
which
in
virtue
of
greater
fitness
for
more
complex
conditions
becomes
capable
of
a
longer
life
of
a
more
varied
kind
and
while
such
higher
type
begins
to
dominate
over
lower
types
and
to
spread
at
their
expense
the
lower
types
survive
in
habitats
or
modes
of
life
that
are
not
usurped
or
are
thrust
into
inferior
habitats
or
modes
of
life
in
which
they
retrogress
spencer
examination
of
the
principles
of
sociology
has
led
him
to
the
belief
that
what
holds
with
organic
types
must
hold
also
with
types
of
society
social
evolution
throughout
the
future
like
social
evolution
throughout
the
past
must
while
producing
step
after
step
higher
societies
leave
outstanding
many
lower
varieties
of
men
adapted
here
to
inclement
regions
there
to
regions
that
are
barren
and
elsewhere
to
regions
unfitted
by
ruggedness
of
surface
or
insalubrity
for
supporting
large
populations
will
in
all
probability
continue
to
form
small
communities
of
simple
structures
moreover
during
future
competitions
among
the
higher
races
there
will
probably
be
left
in
the
less
desirable
regions
minor
nations
formed
of
men
inferior
to
the
highest
at
the
same
time
that
the
highest
overspread
all
the
great
areas
which
are
desirable
in
climate
and
fertility
but
while
the
entire
assemblage
of
societies
thus
fulfils
the
law
of
evolution
by
increase
of
heterogeneity
while
within
each
of
them
contrasts
of
structure
caused
by
differences
of
environments
and
entailed
occupations
cause
unlikenesses
implying
further
heterogeneity
we
may
infer
that
the
primary
process
of
evolution
integration
which
up
to
the
present
time
has
been
displayed
in
the
formation
of
larger
and
larger
nations
will
eventually
reach
a
still
higher
stage
and
bring
yet
greater
benefits
as
when
small
tribes
were
welded
into
great
tribes
the
head
chief
stopped
warfare
as
when
small
feudal
governments
became
subject
to
a
king
feudal
wars
were
prevented
by
him
so
in
time
to
come
a
federation
of
the
highest
nations
exercising
supreme
authority
already
foreshadowed
by
occasional
agreements
among
the
powers
may
by
forbidding
wars
between
any
of
its
constituent
nations
put
an
end
to
the
which
is
continually
undoing
civilization
when
eventually
this
federation
has
been
formed
spencer
looks
for
effectual
progress
towards
that
equilibrium
between
constitution
and
conditions
between
inner
faculties
and
outer
requirements
implied
by
the
final
stage
of
human
evolution
adaptation
to
the
social
state
now
perpetually
hindered
by
conflict
may
then
go
on
unhindered
and
all
the
great
societies
in
other
respects
differing
may
become
similar
in
those
cardinal
traits
which
result
from
complete
of
the
unit
and
from
exercise
over
him
of
nothing
more
than
passive
influence
by
the
aggregate
on
the
one
hand
by
continual
repression
of
aggressive
instincts
and
by
continual
exercise
of
feelings
which
prompt
ministration
to
public
welfare
and
on
the
other
hand
by
the
lapse
of
restraints
gradually
becoming
less
necessary
there
will
be
produced
in
spencer
forecast
a
kind
of
man
so
constituted
that
while
fulfilling
his
own
desires
he
will
fulfil
also
the
social
needs
already
small
groups
of
men
shielded
by
circumstances
from
external
antagonisms
have
been
moulded
into
forms
of
moral
nature
so
superior
to
our
own
that
the
account
of
their
goodness
almost
savors
of
romance
and
it
is
reasonable
to
infer
that
what
has
even
now
happened
on
a
small
scale
may
under
kindred
conditions
ultimately
happen
on
a
large
scale
prolonged
studies
showing
among
other
things
the
need
for
certain
qualifications
above
indicated
but
also
revealing
facts
like
that
just
named
have
not
caused
our
author
to
recede
from
the
belief
expressed
nearly
fifty
years
ago
that
the
ultimate
man
will
be
one
whose
private
requirements
coincide
with
public
ones
he
will
be
that
manner
of
man
who
in
spontaneously
fulfilling
his
own
nature
incidentally
performs
the
functions
of
a
social
unit
and
yet
is
only
enabled
so
to
fulfil
his
own
nature
by
all
others
doing
the
like
before
taking
leave
of
the
principles
of
sociology
we
should
caution
the
reader
against
a
misconception
that
might
seem
at
first
sight
to
find
some
warrant
in
the
following
remark
of
a
sympathetic
reviewer
like
aristotle
he
spencer
has
had
to
delegate
large
portions
of
his
work
to
be
done
for
him
by
others
as
our
author
has
himself
pointed
out
in
facts
and
comments
the
reviewer
reference
will
be
rightly
interpreted
by
those
who
know
that
the
work
delegated
by
aristotle
to
others
was
simply
the
of
materials
for
his
natural
history
not
the
classification
of
those
materials
much
less
the
drawing
of
inductions
from
them
as
not
one
reader
in
ten
knows
this
however
wrong
impressions
are
likely
to
be
made
by
the
remark
spencer
name
being
especially
associated
with
the
synthetic
philosophy
the
sentence
quoted
will
suggest
to
many
the
thought
that
large
portions
of
that
work
were
written
by
deputy
this
of
course
the
reviewer
did
not
mean
to
say
the
work
to
which
he
referred
is
entitled
descriptive
sociology
or
groups
of
sociological
facts
classified
and
arranged
by
herbert
spencer
compiled
and
abstracted
by
david
duncan
richard
scheppig
and
james
collier
eight
parts
of
which
have
thus
far
appeared
knowing
that
he
should
be
unable
to
read
all
the
works
of
travel
and
history
containing
the
facts
he
should
need
when
dealing
with
the
science
of
society
spencer
engaged
these
gentlemen
first
one
then
two
then
three
to
read
up
for
him
and
arrange
the
extracts
they
made
in
a
manner
prescribed
with
much
material
he
had
himself
accumulated
in
the
course
of
many
years
our
author
incorporated
a
much
larger
amount
of
material
derived
from
the
compilations
just
mentioned
when
writing
the
principles
of
sociology
vi
it
is
the
two
volumes
entitled
the
principles
of
ethics
to
which
we
shall
lastly
invite
attention
the
six
parts
of
which
this
work
is
composed
were
published
in
an
irregular
manner
part
presenting
the
data
of
ethics
was
issued
in
part
a
treatise
on
justice
in
parts
ii
and
which
set
forth
respectively
the
inductions
of
ethics
and
the
ethics
of
individual
life
and
which
along
with
part
form
the
first
volume
were
issued
in
parts
and
which
treat
respectively
of
negative
beneficence
and
positive
beneficence
were
issued
in
and
along
with
part
constitute
the
second
volume
with
regard
to
the
principles
of
ethics
considered
as
a
whole
it
should
be
noted
that
the
author
was
prompted
to
prepare
the
work
notwithstanding
the
ill
health
by
which
he
was
incessantly
interrupted
by
the
conviction
that
the
establishment
of
rules
of
conduct
on
a
scientific
basis
is
a
pressing
need
now
that
moral
injunctions
are
losing
the
authority
given
by
their
supposed
sacred
origin
the
secularization
of
morals
is
becoming
imperative
those
who
reject
the
current
creed
appear
to
assume
that
the
controlling
agency
conferred
by
it
may
safely
be
thrown
aside
on
the
other
hand
those
who
defend
the
current
creed
allege
that
in
the
absence
of
the
guidance
it
yields
no
guidance
can
exist
divine
commandments
being
in
their
opinion
the
only
possible
guides
dissenting
from
both
of
these
beliefs
spencer
has
had
for
his
primary
purpose
in
the
two
volumes
under
review
to
show
that
apart
from
any
supposed
supernatural
basis
the
principles
of
ethics
have
a
natural
basis
in
these
two
volumes
this
natural
basis
is
set
forth
and
its
corollaries
are
elaborated
if
the
conclusions
to
which
the
general
law
of
evolution
introduces
us
are
not
in
all
cases
as
definite
as
might
be
wished
yet
our
author
submits
that
they
are
more
definite
than
those
to
which
we
are
introduced
by
the
current
creed
complete
definiteness
is
not
of
course
to
be
expected
right
regulation
of
the
actions
of
so
complex
a
being
as
man
living
under
conditions
so
complex
as
those
presented
by
a
society
evidently
forms
a
unlikely
to
admit
of
specific
statements
throughout
its
entire
range
the
principal
inductions
drawn
from
the
data
collected
in
the
first
of
these
volumes
may
be
set
forth
in
a
few
sentences
multitudinous
proofs
are
brought
forward
of
the
fact
that
the
ethical
sentiment
prevailing
in
different
societies
and
in
the
same
society
under
different
conditions
are
sometimes
diametrically
opposed
in
europe
and
in
the
united
states
to
have
committed
a
murder
disgraces
for
all
time
a
man
memory
and
disgraces
for
generations
all
who
are
related
to
him
by
the
pathans
however
a
contrary
sentiment
is
displayed
one
who
had
killed
a
mellah
priest
and
failed
to
find
refuge
from
the
avengers
said
at
length
i
can
but
be
a
martyr
i
will
go
and

at
having

his
offence
the
prevailing
ethical
sentiment
in
england
is
such
that
a
man
who
should
allow
himself
to
be
taken
possession
of
and
made
an
unresisting
slave
would
be
regarded
with
scorn
but
the
people
of
drekete
a
of
fiji
said
it
was
their
duty
to
become
food
and
sacrifices
for
the
chiefs
and
that
they
were
honored
by
being
considered
adequate
to
such
a
noble
task
less
extreme
though
akin
in
nature
is
the
contrast
between
the
feelings
which
the
history
of
englishmen
has
recorded
within
a
few
centuries
in
elizabeth
time
sir
john
hawkins
initiated
the
and
in
commemoration
of
the
achievement
was
allowed
to
put
in
his
a
proper
bound
with
a
cord
the
honorableness
of
his
action
being
thus
assumed
by
himself
and
recognized
by
queen
and
public
at
the
present
day
on
the
other
hand
the
making
slaves
of
men
called
by
wesley
the
sum
of
all
villanies
is
regarded
in
england
with
detestation
and
for
many
years
the
british
government
maintained
a
fleet
to
suppress
the
again
peoples
who
have
emerged
from
the
primitive
organization
hold
that
one
who
is
guilty
of
a
crime
must
himself
bear
the
punishment
and
it
is
thought
extreme
injustice
that
the
punishment
should
fall
upon
any
one
else
the
remote
ancestors
of
the
english
people
thought
and
felt
differently
as
do
still
the
australians
whose
first
great
principle
with
regard
to
punishment
is
that
all
the
relatives
of
a
culprit
in
the
event
of
his
not
being
found
are
implicated
in
his
guilt
the
brothers
of
the
criminal
conceive
themselves
to
be
quite
as
guilty
as
he
is
then
too
among
civilized
peoples
the
individualities
of
women
are
so
far
recognized
that
the
life
and
liberty
of
a
wife
are
not
supposed
to
be
bound
up
with
those
of
her
husband
and
she
now
having
obtained
a
right
to
exclusive
possession
of
property
contends
for
complete
independence
domestic
and
political
it
is
or
was
otherwise
in
fiji
the
wives
of
the
fijian
chiefs
consider
it
a
sacred
duty
to
suffer
strangulation
on
the
deaths
of
their
husbands
a
woman
who
had
been
rescued
by
an
englishman
escaped
during
the
night
and
swimming
across
the
river
and
presenting
herself
to
her
own
people
insisted
upon
the
completion
of
the
sacrifice
which
she
had
in
a
moment
of
weakness
reluctantly
consented
to
forego
another
foreign
observer
tells
of
a
fijian
woman
who
loaded
her
rescuer
with
abuse
and
ever
afterwards
manifested
the
most
deadly
hatred
towards
him
in
england
and
on
the
continent
the
religious
prohibition
of
theft
and
the
legal
punishment
of
it
are
joined
with
a
strong
social
reprobation
so
that
the
offence
of
a
thief
is
never
condoned
in
beloochistan
on
the
other
hand
quite
contrary
ideas
and
feelings
are
current
there
a
favorite
couplet
is
to
the
effect
that
the
biloch
who
steals
and
murders
secures
heaven
to
seven
generations
of
ancestors
in
england
and
the
united
states
reprobation
of
untruthfulness
is
strongly
expressed
alike
by
the
gentleman
and
the
laborer
in
many
parts
of
the
world
it
is
not
so
in
blantyre
for
example
according
to
macdonald
to
be
called
a
liar
is
rather
a
compliment
once
more
english
sentiment
is
such
that
the
mere
suspicion
of
incontinence
on
the
part
of
a
woman
is
enough
to
blight
her
life
but
there
are
peoples
whose
sentiments
entail
no
such
effect
and
in
some
cases
a
reverse
effect
is
produced
unchastity
is
with
the
wetyaks
a
virtue
it
seems
then
that
in
respect
of
all
the
leading
divisions
of
human
conduct
different
races
of
men
and
the
same
races
at
different
stages
entertain
opposite
beliefs
and
display
opposite
feelings
in
spencer
opinion
the
evidence
here
brought
to
a
focus
ought
to
dissipate
once
for
all
the
belief
in
a
moral
sense
as
commonly
entertained
a
long
experience
of
mankind
however
prevents
him
from
indulging
in
such
an
expectation
among
men
at
large
lifelong
convictions
are
not
to
be
destroyed
either
by
conclusive
arguments
or
multitudinous
facts
only
to
those
who
are
not
by
creed
or
cherished
theory
committed
to
the
hypothesis
of
a
supernaturally
created
human
species
will
the
evidence
above
summed
up
prove
that
the
human
mind
has
no
originally
implanted
conscience
spencer
himself
at
one
time
espoused
the
doctrine
of
the
intuitive
moralists
but
it
has
gradually
become
clear
to
him
that
the
qualifications
required
practically
obliterate
the
doctrine
as
enunciated
by
them
it
has
become
clear
to
him
in
other
words
that
if
among
civilized
folk
the
current
belief
is
that
a
man
who
robs
and
does
not
repent
will
be
eternally
damned
while
an
accepted
proverb
among
the
bilochs
is
that
god
will
not
favor
a
man
who
does
not
steal
and
rob
it
is
impossible
to
hold
that
men
have
in
common
an
innate
perception
of
right
and
wrong
at
the
same
time
while
the
inductions
drawn
by
spencer
from
the
data
of
ethics
show
that
the
doctrine
in
its
original
form
is
not
true
they
also
show
that
it
adumbrates
a
truth
and
a
much
higher
truth
for
the
facts
cited
chapter
after
chapter
unite
in
proving
that
the
sentiments
and
ideas
current
in
each
society
become
adjusted
to
the
kinds
of
activity
predominating
in
it
a
life
of
constant
external
enmity
generates
a
code
in
which
aggression
conquest
revenge
are
inculcated
while
peaceful
occupations
are
reprobated
conversely
a
life
of
settled
internal
amity
generates
a
code
inculcating
the
virtues
conducing
to
harmonious
justice
honesty
veracity
regard
for
others
claims
the
implication
is
that
if
the
life
of
internal
amity
continues
unbroken
from
generation
to
generation
there
must
result
not
only
the
appropriate
code
but
the
appropriate
emotional
nature
a
moral
sense
adapted
to
the
moral
requirements
men
so
conditioned
will
acquire
to
the
degree
needful
for
complete
guidance
that
innate
conscience
which
the
intuitive
moralists
erroneously
supposed
to
be
possessed
by
mankind
at
large
there
needs
but
a
continuance
of
absolute
peace
externally
and
a
rigorous
insistence
on
internally
to
insure
the
moulding
of
men
into
a
form
naturally
characterized
by
all
the
virtues
this
general
induction
is
by
especial
induction
now
as
displaying
this
high
trait
of
nature
now
as
displaying
that
spencer
has
instanced
various
uncivilized
peoples
who
inferior
to
us
in
other
respects
are
morally
superior
to
us
he
has
also
pointed
out
that
such
peoples
are
one
and
all
free
from
antagonisms
the
peoples
showing
this
connection
between
external
and
internal
peacefulness
on
the
one
hand
and
superior
morality
on
the
other
are
of
various
races
in
the
indian
hills
are
found
some
who
are
by
origin
mongolian
kelarian
dravidian
in
the
forests
of
malacca
burma
and
in
secluded
parts
of
china
exist
such
tribes
of
yet
other
bloods
in
the
east
indian
archipelago
are
some
belonging
to
the
papuan
stock
in
japan
there
are
the
amiable
ainos
who
have
no
traditions
of
internecine
strife
and
in
north
mexico
exists
yet
another
such
people
unrelated
to
the
rest
the
pueblos
our
author
holds
that
no
more
conclusive
proof
could
be
wished
than
that
supplied
by
these
isolated
groups
of
men
who
widely
remote
in
locality
and
differing
in
race
are
alike
in
the
two
respects
that
circumstances
have
long
exempted
them
from
war
and
that
they
are
now
organically
good
may
we
not
reasonably
infer
asks
spencer
in
conclusion
that
the
state
reached
by
these
small
uncultured
tribes
may
be
reached
by
the
great
cultured
nations
when
the
life
of
internal
amity
shall
be
unqualified
by
the
life
of
external
enmity
we
bring
to
an
end
our
review
of
the
synthetic
philosophy
by
pointing
out
that
the
ethical
doctrine
constituting
the
culmination
of
the
system
which
is
set
forth
in
the
principles
of
ethics
is
fundamentally
a
corrected
and
elaborated
version
of
the
doctrine
propounded
in
social
statics
issued
as
long
ago
as
the
correspondence
between
the
two
works
is
shown
not
only
by
the
coincidence
of
their
constructive
divisions
but
also
by
the
agreement
of
their
cardinal
ideas
as
in
the
one
so
in
the
other
man
in
common
with
lower
creatures
is
held
to
be
capable
of
indefinite
change
by
adaptation
to
conditions
in
both
he
is
regarded
as
undergoing
transformation
from
a
nature
appropriate
to
his
aboriginal
wild
life
to
a
nature
appropriate
to
a
settled
civilized
life
and
in
both
this
transformation
is
described
as
a
moulding
into
a
form
fitted
for
harmonious
in
both
works
too
this
moulding
is
said
to
be
effected
by
the
repression
of
certain
primitive
traits
no
longer
needed
and
the
development
of
needful
traits
as
in
the
first
work
so
in
this
last
the
great
factor
in
the
progressive
modification
is
shown
to
be
sympathy
it
was
contended
in
social
statics
as
it
is
contended
in
the
principles
of
ethics
that
harmonious
social
implies
that
limitation
of
individual
freedom
which
results
from
sympathetic
regard
for
the
freedoms
of
others
and
that
the
law
of
equal
freedom
is
the
law
in
conformity
to
which
equitable
individual
conduct
and
equitable
social
arrangements
spencer
theory
in
was
as
his
theory
still
is
that
the
mental
products
of
sympathy
which
constitute
what
is
called
the
moral
sense
arise
as
fast
as
men
are
disciplined
into
social
life
and
that
along
with
them
arise
intellectual
perceptions
of
right
human
relations
which
become
clearer
as
the
form
of
social
life
becomes
better
further
in
the
earlier
work
it
was
inferred
as
it
is
inferred
in
the
latest
that
there
is
being
effected
a
conciliation
of
individual
natures
with
social
requirements
so
that
there
will
eventually
be
achieved
the
greatest
individuation
along
with
the
greatest
mutual
dependence
an
equilibrium
of
such
kind
that
each
in
fulfilling
the
wants
of
his
own
life
will
aid
in
fulfilling
the
wants
of
all
other
lives
we
observe
finally
that
in
the
first
work
there
were
drawn
essentially
the
same
corollaries
respecting
the
rights
of
individuals
and
their
relations
to
the
state
that
are
drawn
in
the
principles
of
ethics
a
word
may
be
said
in
conclusion
about
the
difference
between
the
relation
of
spencer
on
the
one
hand
and
darwin
on
the
other
to
the
thought
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
fact
is
not
to
be
lost
sight
of
that
the
principles
of
the
evolutionary
or
as
spencer
prefers
to
term
it
the
synthetic
philosophy
were
formulated
before
the
publication
of
the
origin
of
species
what
the
ultimately
general
acceptance
of
the
theory
propounded
in
darwin
work
did
for
spencer
was
precisely
this
it
greatly
strengthened
the
biological
evidence
for
the
evolutionary
hypothesis
that
hypothesis
was
upheld
however
by
evidence
drawn
not
merely
from
biology
but
from
many
other
sources
moreover
while
the
darwinian
theory
of
natural
selection
supplemented
as
it
was
by
the
adoption
of
the
lamarkian
factors
the
effect
of
use
and
disuse
and
the
assumed
transmissibility
of
acquired
character
merely
attempted
to
explain
the
mode
in
which
the
changes
in
organic
life
have
taken
place
upon
the
earth
the
evolutionary
hypothesis
put
forth
by
spencer
professed
to
be
applicable
to
the
whole
sphere
of
the
knowable
it
is
further
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
spencer
has
devoted
a
large
part
of
his
life
to
tracing
in
detail
the
applications
of
his
fundamental
principles
to
social
political
religious
and
ethical
phenomena
darwin
on
the
other
hand
strictly
confined
himself
to
the
biological
field
and
left
to
disciples
the
task
of
indicating
the
bearing
of
the
darwinian
theory
upon
sociology
theology
and

there
is
no
doubt
that
by
the
judgment
of
a
large
majority
of
scientists
the
place
of
in
the
history
of
science
during
the
nineteenth
century
should
be
assigned
to
charles
robert
darwin
the
theory
associated
with
his
name
deserves
to
be
called
the
darwinian
hypothesis
indeed
should
not
be
confounded
with
the
cosmic
theory
of
evolution
which
was
formulated
earlier
and
independently
by
herbert
spencer
and
supported
by
many
arguments
drawn
from
sources
outside
the
field
of
natural
history
the
specific
merit
of
the
darwinian
hypothesis
is
that
it
furnishes
a
rational
and
almost
universally
accepted
explanation
of
the
mode
in
which
changes
have
taken
place
in
the
development
of
organic
life
upon
the
earth
with
the
possible
cosmical
applications
of
his
theory
darwin
did
not
concern
himself
though
the
bearing
of
his
hypothesis
upon
wider
problems
was
at
once
discerned
and
has
been
set
forth
by
spencer
and
others
before
stating
however
the
conclusions
at
which
darwin
arrived
in
his
origin
of
species
the
descent
of
man
and
other
writings
and
before
indicating
the
extent
to
which
these
conclusions
have
been
adopted
we
should
say
a
word
about
his
interesting
amiable
and
exemplary
personality
concerning
his
private
life
there
is
no
lack
of
information
he
himself
wrote
an
autobiographical
sketch
which
has
been
amplified
by
his
son
francis
darwin
and
supplemented
with
numerous
extracts
from
his
correspondence
charles
robert
darwin
was
born
at
shrewsbury
his
mother
was
a
daughter
of
josiah
wedgwood
the
staffordshire
potter
and
his
father
robert
waring
darwin
was
a
son
of
erasmus
darwin
celebrated
in
the
eighteenth
century
as
a
physician
a
naturalist
and
a
poet
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
in
some
of
his
speculations
erasmus
darwin
anticipated
the
views
touching
the
evolution
of
organic
life
subsequently
announced
by
lamarck
and
ultimately
incorporated
by
charles
darwin
in
the
theory
that
bears
his
name
the
only
taste
kindred
to
natural
history
which
darwin
possessed
in
common
with
his
father
and
his
son
was
a
love
of
plants
the
garden
of
his
house
in
shrewsbury
where
charles
darwin
spent
his
boyhood
was
filled
with
ornamental
trees
and
shrubs
as
well
as
when
charles
darwin
was
about
eight
years
old
he
was
sent
to
a
and
it
seems
that
even
at
this
time
his
taste
for
natural
history
and
especially
for
collecting
shells
and
minerals
was
well
developed
in
the
summer
of
he
entered
butler
great
school
in
shrewsbury
well
known
to
the
amateur
makers
of
latin
verse
by
the
volume
entitled
sabrinae
corolla
he
expressed
the
opinion
in
later
life
that
nothing
could
have
been
worse
for
the
development
of
his
mind
than
this
school
as
it
was
strictly
classical
nothing
else
being
taught
except
a
little
ancient
biography
and
history
during
his
whole
life
he
was
singularly
incapable
of
mastering
any
language
with
respect
to
science
he
continued
collecting
minerals
with
much
zeal
and
after
reading
white
selborne
he
took
much
pleasure
in
watching
the
habits
of
birds
towards
the
close
of
his
school
life
he
became
deeply
interested
in
chemistry
and
was
allowed
to
assist
his
elder
brother
in
some
laboratory
experiments
in
october
he
proceeded
to
edinburgh
university
where
he
stayed
for
two
years
he
found
the
lectures
intolerably
dull
with
the
exception
of
those
on
chemistry
curiously
enough
while
walking
one
day
with
a
the
latter
burst
forth
in
high
admiration
of
lamarck
and
his
views
on
evolution
so
far
as
darwin
could
afterwards
judge
no
impression
was
made
upon
his
own
mind
he
had
previously
read
his
grandfather
zoönomia
in
which
similar
views
had
been
propounded
but
no
discernible
effect
had
been
produced
upon
him
nevertheless
it
is
probable
enough
that
the
hearing
rather
early
in
life
such
views
maintained
and
praised
may
have
favored
his
upholding
them
under
a
different
form
in
the
origin
of
species
while
at
edinburgh
darwin
was
a
member
of
the
plinian
society
and
read
a
couple
of
papers
on
some
observations
in
natural
history
after
two
sessions
had
been
spent
at
edinburgh
darwin
father
perceived
that
the
young
man
did
not
like
the
thought
of
being
a
physician
and
proposed
that
he
should
become
a
clergyman
in
pursuance
of
this
proposal
he
went
to
the
university
of
cambridge
in
and
three
years
later
took
a
degree
in
his
autobiography
the
opinion
is
expressed
that
at
cambridge
his
time
was
wasted
it
was
there
however
that
he
became
intimately
acquainted
with
professor
henslow
a
man
of
remarkable
acquirements
in
botany
entomology
chemistry
mineralogy
and
geology
during
his
last
year
at
cambridge
darwin
read
with
care
and
interest
humboldt
personal
narrative
and
sir
john
herschel
introduction
to
the
study
of
natural
philosophy
these
books
influenced
him
profoundly
arousing
in
him
a
burning
desire
to
make
even
the
most
humble
contribution
to
the
structure
of
natural
science
at
suggestion
he
began
the
study
of
biology
and
in
accompanied
professor
sedgwick
in
the
latter
investigations
amongst
the
older
rocks
in
north
wales
it
was
professor
henslow
who
secured
for
young
darwin
the
appointment
of
naturalist
to
the
voyage
of
the
beagle
this
voyage
lasted
from
to
the
incidents
of
this
voyage
will
be
found
set
forth
in
darwin
public
journeys
the
observations
made
by
him
in
geology
natural
history
and
botany
gave
him
a
place
of
considerable
distinction
among
scientific
men
in
he
published
a
series
of
observations
on
the
volcanic
islands
visited
during
the
voyage
of
the
beagle
and
two
years
later
geological
observations
on
south
america
these
two
books
together
with
a
volume
entitled
coral
reefs
required
four
and
a
half
years
steady
work
in
october
he
began
the
studies
embodied
in
cirripedia
barnacles
the
outcome
of
these
studies
was
published
in
two
thick
volumes
the
time
came
when
darwin
doubted
whether
the
work
was
worth
the
consumption
of
the
time
employed
but
probably
it
proved
of
use
to
him
when
he
had
to
discuss
in
the
origin
of
species
the
principles
of
a
natural
classification
from
september
and
during
the
four
ensuing
years
darwin
devoted
himself
to
observing
and
experimenting
in
relation
to
the
transmutation
of
species
and
in
arranging
a
huge
pile
of
notes
upon
the
subject
as
early
as
october
it
had
occurred
to
him
as
probable
or
at
least
possible
that
amid
the
struggle
for
existence
which
everywhere
goes
on
in
the
animal
world
favorable
variations
would
tend
to
be
preserved
and
unfavorable
ones
to
be
destroyed
the
result
would
be
the
formation
of
new
species
it
was
not
until
june
however
that
darwin
allowed
himself
the
satisfaction
of
writing
a
very
brief
abstract
of
his
theory
in
pages
this
was
enlarged
two
years
later
into
one
of
pages
early
in
sir
charles
lyell
the
geologist
advised
him
to
write
out
his
views
upon
the
subject
fully
and
darwin
began
to
do
so
on
a
scale
three
or
four
times
as
extensive
as
that
which
was
afterwards
followed
in
his
origin
of
species
he
got
through
about
half
the
work
on
this
scale
his
plans
were
overthrown
owing
to
the
curious
circumstance
that
in
the
summer
of
alfred
wallace
who
was
then
in
the
malay
archipelago
sent
him
an
essay
on
the
tendency
of
varieties
to
depart
indefinitely
from
the
original
type
it
turned
out
upon
perusal
that
this
essay
contained
exactly
the
same
theory
as
that
which
darwin
was
engaged
in
elaborating
wallace
expressed
the
wish
that
if
darwin
thought
well
of
the
essay
he
should
send
it
to
lyell
it
was
sir
charles
lyell
and
sir
joseph
hooker
who
insisted
that
darwin
should
allow
an
abstract
from
his
manuscript
together
with
a
letter
to
asa
gray
dated
to
be
published
at
the
same
time
with
wallace
essay
darwin
was
unwilling
to
take
this
course
being
then
unacquainted
with
wallace
generous
disposition
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
joint
productions
excited
very
little
attention
and
the
only
published
notice
of
them
asserted
that
what
was
new
in
them
was
false
and
that
what
was
true
was
old
from
the
indifference
evinced
to
the
papers
which
first
propounded
the
theory
of
natural
selection
darwin
drew
the
inference
that
it
is
necessary
for
any
new
view
to
be
explained
at
considerable
length
in
order
to
obtain
the
public
ear
in
september
darwin
at
the
earnest
advice
of
lyell
and
hooker
set
to
work
to
prepare
a
volume
on
the
transmutation
of
species
the
book
cost
him
more
than
thirteen
months
hard
labor
it
was
published
in
november
under
the
title
of
origin
of
species
this
which
darwin
justly
regarded
as
the
chief
work
of
his
life
was
from
the
first
highly
successful
the
first
edition
was
sold
on
the
day
of
publication
and
the
book
was
presently
translated
into
almost
every
european
tongue
darwin
himself
attributed
the
success
of
the
origin
in
large
part
to
his
having
previously
written
two
condensed
sketches
and
to
his
having
finally
made
an
abstract
of
a
much
larger
manuscript
which
itself
was
an
abstract
by
this
winnowing
process
he
had
been
enabled
to
select
the
more
striking
facts
and
conclusions
as
to
the
current
assertion
that
the
origin
succeeded
because
the
subject
was
in
the
air
or
because
men
minds
were
prepared
for
it
darwin
was
disposed
to
doubt
whether
this
was
strictly
true
in
previous
years
he
had
occasionally
sounded
not
a
few
naturalists
and
had
never
come
across
a
single
one
who
seemed
to
doubt
about
the
permanence
of
species
probably
men
minds
were
prepared
in
this
sense
that
innumerable
facts
were
stored
away
in
the
memories
of
naturalists
ready
to
take
their
proper
places
as
soon
as
any
theory
which
would
account
for
them
should
be
strongly
supported
darwin
himself
thought
that
he
gained
much
by
a
delay
in
publishing
from
about
when
the
darwinian
theory
was
clearly
conceived
to
and
that
he
lost
nothing
because
he
cared
very
little
whether
men
attributed
most
originality
to
him
or
to
wallace
darwin
variation
of
animals
and
plants
under
domestication
was
begun
in
but
was
not
published
till
the
book
was
a
big
one
and
cost
him
four
years
and
two
months
hard
labor
it
gives
in
the
first
volume
all
his
personal
observations
and
an
immense
number
of
facts
collected
from
various
sources
about
domestic
productions
animal
and
vegetable
in
the
second
volume
the
causes
and
laws
of
variation
inheritance
are
discussed
towards
the
end
of
the
work
is
propounded
the
hypothesis
of
pangenesis
which
has
been
generally
rejected
and
which
the
author
himself
looked
upon
as
unverified
although
by
it
a
remarkable
number
of
isolated
facts
could
be
connected
together
and
rendered
intelligible
the
descent
of
man
was
published
in
february
touching
this
work
darwin
has
told
us
that
as
soon
as
he
had
become
in
or
convinced
that
species
were
mutable
productions
he
could
not
avoid
the
belief
that
man
must
come
under
the
same
law
accordingly
he
collected
notes
on
the
subject
for
his
own
satisfaction
and
not
for
a
long
time
with
any
intention
of
publishing
in
the
origin
of
species
the
derivation
of
any
particular
species
is
never
discussed
but
in
order
that
no
honorable
man
should
accuse
him
of
concealing
his
views
darwin
had
thought
it
best
to
add
that
by
that
work
light
would
be
thrown
on
the
origin
of
man
and
his
history
it
would
have
impeded
the
acceptance
of
the
theory
of
natural
selection
if
darwin
had
paraded
without
giving
any
evidence
his
conviction
with
respect
to
origin
when
he
found
however
that
many
naturalists
accepted
his
doctrine
of
the
evolution
of
species
it
seemed
to
him
advisable
to
work
up
such
notes
as
he
possessed
and
to
publish
a
special
treatise
on
the
origin
of
man
he
was
the
more
glad
to
do
so
as
it
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
discussing
at
length
sexual
selection
a
subject
which
had
always
interested
him
darwin
book
on
the
expression
of
emotion
in
men
and
animals
was
published
in
the
autumn
of
this
had
been
intended
to
form
a
chapter
on
the
subject
in
the
descent
of
man
but
as
soon
as
darwin
began
to
put
his
notes
together
he
saw
that
it
would
require
a
separate
treatise
in
july
appeared
the
book
on
insectivorous
plants
the
fact
that
a
plant
should
secrete
when
properly
excited
a
fluid
containing
an
acid
and
ferment
closely
analogous
to
the
digestive
fluid
of
an
animal
was
certainly
a
remarkable
discovery
in
the
autumn
of
appeared
the
effects
of
cross
and
self
fertilization
a
work
in
which
are
described
the
endless
and
wonderful
contrivances
for
the
transportation
of
pollen
from
one
plant
to
another
of
the
same
species
about
the
same
time
was
brought
out
an
enlarged
edition
of
the
fertilization
of
orchids
originally
published
in
among
the
minor
works
issued
during
the
later
years
of
darwin
life
may
be
mentioned
particularly
the
little
book
on
the
formation
of
vegetable
mould
through
the
action
of
worms
this
was
the
outgrowth
of
a
short
paper
read
before
the
geological
society
more
than
fourteen
years
before
in
order
to
appreciate
the
enormous
amount
of
research
accomplished
by
charles
darwin
it
is
needful
to
keep
in
mind
the
conditions
of
under
which
almost
continually
he
worked
for
nearly
forty
years
he
never
knew
one
day
of
the
health
of
ordinary
men
his
life
was
one
long
struggle
against
the
weariness
and
drain
of
sickness
during
his
last
ten
years
there
were
signs
of
amendment
in
several
particulars
but
a
loss
of
physical
vigor
was
apparent
writing
to
a
friend
in
he
complained
that
he
no
longer
had
the
heart
or
strength
to
begin
any
prolonged
investigations
in
february
and
march
he
frequently
experienced
attacks
of
pain
in
the
region
of
the
heart
attended
with
irregularity
of
the
pulse
on
april
he
fainted
and
was
brought
back
to
consciousness
with
great
difficulty
he
seemed
to
recognize
the
approach
of
death
and
said
i
am
not
the
least
afraid
to
die
on
the
afternoon
of
wednesday
april
he
passed
away
on
april
he
was
interred
in
westminster
abbey
the
funeral
was
attended
by
representatives
of
france
germany
italy
spain
and
russia
and
by
delegates
of
the
universities
and
learned
societies
of
which
he
had
been
a
member
among
the
were
sir
john
lubbock
sir
joseph
hooker
professor
huxley
wallace
james
russell
lowell
the
duke
of
argyll
and
the
duke
of
devonshire
the
grave
is
appropriately
placed
in
the
north
aisle
of
the
nave
only
a
few
feet
from
the
last
of
sir
isaac
newton
ii
an
outline
of
darwin
personality
would
not
be
complete
without
a
glance
at
some
of
his
mental
characteristics
and
at
his
attitude
toward
religion
of
his
intellectual
powers
he
himself
speaks
with
extraordinary
modesty
in
his
autobiography
he
points
out
that
he
always
experienced
much
difficulty
in
expressing
himself
clearly
and
concisely
but
he
opines
that
this
very
difficulty
may
have
had
the
compensating
advantage
of
forcing
him
to
think
long
and
intently
about
every
sentence
and
thus
enabling
him
to
detect
errors
in
reasoning
and
in
his
own
observations
or
in
those
of
others
he
disclaimed
the
possession
of
any
great
quickness
of
apprehension
or
wit
such
as
distinguished
huxley
he
protested
also
that
his
power
to
follow
a
long
and
purely
abstract
train
of
thought
was
very
limited
for
which
reason
he
felt
certain
that
he
never
could
have
succeeded
with
metaphysics
or
mathematics
his
memory
too
he
described
as
extensive
but
hazy
so
poor
in
one
sense
was
it
that
he
never
could
remember
for
more
than
a
few
days
a
single
date
or
a
line
of
poetry
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
accept
as
well
founded
the
charge
made
by
some
of
his
critics
that
while
he
was
a
good
observer
he
had
no
power
of
reasoning
this
he
thought
could
not
be
true
because
the
origin
of
species
is
one
long
argument
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
and
has
convinced
many
able
men
no
one
he
submits
could
have
written
it
without
possessing
some
power
of
reasoning
he
was
willing
to
assert
that
i
have
a
fair
share
of
invention
and
of
common
sense
or
judgment
such
as
every
fairly
successful
lawyer
or
doctor
must
have
but
not
i
believe
in
any
higher
degree
he
adds
humbly
that
perhaps
he
was
superior
to
the
common
run
of
men
in
noticing
things
which
easily
escape
attention
and
in
observing
them
carefully
writing
in
the
last
year
of
his
life
he
expressed
the
opinion
that
in
two
or
three
respects
his
mind
had
changed
during
the
preceding
twenty
or
thirty
years
up
to
the
age
of
thirty
or
beyond
it
poetry
of
many
kinds
gave
him
great
pleasure
formerly
too
pictures
had
given
him
considerable
and
music
very
great
delight
in
however
he
said
now
for
many
years
i
can
not
endure
to
read
a
line
of
poetry
i
have
tried
lately
to
read
shakspeare
and
found
it
so
intolerably
dull
that
it
nauseated
me
i
have
also
almost
lost
my
taste
for
pictures
or
music
music
generally
sets
me
thinking
too
energetically
of
what
i
have
been
at
work
on
instead
of
giving
me
pleasure
i
retain
some
taste
for
fine
scenery
but
it
does
not
cause
me
the
exquisite
delight
which
it
formerly
did
darwin
was
convinced
that
the
loss
of
these
tastes
was
not
only
a
loss
of
happiness
but
might
possibly
be
injurious
to
the
intellect
and
more
probably
to
the
moral
character
by
enfeebling
the
emotional
side
of
one
nature
so
far
as
he
could
judge
his
mind
had
become
in
his
later
years
a
kind
of
machine
for
grinding
general
laws
out
of
large
collections
of
facts
and
that
atrophy
had
taken
place
in
that
part
of
the
brain
on
which
the
higher
aesthetic
tastes
depend
curiously
enough
however
he
retained
his
relish
for
novels
and
for
books
on
history
biography
and
travels
it
is
well
known
that
darwin
was
extremely
reticent
with
regard
to
his
religious
views
he
believed
that
a
man
religion
was
essentially
a
private
matter
repeated
attempts
were
made
to
draw
him
out
upon
the
subject
and
some
of
these
were
partially
successful
writing
to
a
dutch
student
in
he
said
i
may
say
that
the
impossibility
of
conceiving
that
this
grand
and
wondrous
universe
with
our
conscious
selves
arose
through
chance
seems
to
me
the
chief
argument
for
the
existence
of
god
but
whether
this
is
an
argument
of
real
value
i
have
never
been
able
to
decide
i
am
aware
that
if
we
admit
a
first
cause
the
mind
still
craves
to
know
whence
it
came
and
how
it
arose
nor
can
i
overlook
the
difficulty
from
the
immense
amount
of
suffering
through
the
world
i
am
also
induced
to
defer
to
a
certain
extent
to
the
judgment
of
the
many
able
men
who
have
fully
believed
in
god
but
here
again
i
see
how
poor
an
argument
this
is
the
safest
conclusion
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
subject
is
beyond
the
scope
of
man
intellect
but
man
can
do
his
duty
to
questions
put
by
a
german
student
in
he
replied
science
has
nothing
to
do
with
christ
except
in
so
far
as
the
habit
of
scientific
research
makes
a
man
cautious
in
admitting
evidence
for
myself
i
do
not
believe
that
there
ever
has
been
any
revelation
as
for
a
future
life
every
man
must
judge
for
himself
between
conflicting
vague
probabilities
in
the
same
year
he
told
another
correspondent
in
my
most
extreme
fluctuations
i
have
never
been
an
atheist
in
the
sense
of
denying
the
existence
of
a
god
i
think
that
generally
and
more
and
more
as
i
grow
older
but
not
always
that
an
agnostic
would
be
the
more
correct
description
of
my
state
of
mind
his
latest
view
is
indicated
in
a
letter
dated
july
here
he
expressed
the
inward
conviction
that
the
universe
is
not
the
result
of
chance
he
adds
however
but
then
with
me
the
horrid
doubt
always
arises
whether
the
convictions
of
man
mind
which
has
been
developed
from
the
mind
of
the
lower
animals
are
of
any
value
or
at
all
trustworthy
would
any
one
trust
the
convictions
in
a
monkey
mind
if
there
are
any
convictions
in
such
a
mind
the
duke
of
argyll
has
recorded
the
few
words
on
the
subject
spoken
by
darwin
in
the
last
year
of
his
life
the
duke
said
that
it
was
impossible
to
look
at
the
wonderful
contrivances
for
certain
purposes
in
nature
and
fail
to
recognize
that
they
were
the
effect
and
the
expression
of
mind
darwin
looked
at
the
duke
very
hard
and
said
well
that
often
comes
over
me
with
overwhelming
force
but
at
other
times
here
he
shook
his
head
vaguely
it
seems
to
go
away
iii
we
pass
to
a
consideration
of
darwin
masterworks
the
origin
of
species
the
variation
of
animals
and
plants
under
domestication
and
the
descent
of
man
before
indicating
the
conclusions
reached
in
the
first
of
these
works
we
should
point
out
to
what
extent
darwin
had
been
preceded
by
dissenters
from
the
belief
once
almost
universally
entertained
by
biologists
that
species
were
independently
created
and
once
created
were
immutable
lamarck
was
the
first
naturalist
whose
divergent
views
upon
the
subject
excited
much
attention
in
writings
published
at
various
dates
from
to
he
upheld
the
doctrine
that
all
species
including
man
are
descended
from
other
species
he
pronounced
it
probable
that
all
changes
in
the
organic
as
well
as
in
the
inorganic
world
were
the
result
of
law
and
not
of
miraculous
interposition
he
seems
to
have
been
led
to
his
opinion
that
the
change
of
species
had
been
gradual
by
the
difficulty
experienced
in
distinguishing
species
from
varieties
by
the
almost
perfect
gradation
of
forms
in
certain
groups
and
by
the
analogy
of
domestic
productions
with
respect
to
the
means
of
modification
he
attributed
something
to
the
direct
action
of
the
physical
conditions
of
life
something
to
the
crossing
of
already
existing
forms
and
much
to
use
and
disuse
or
in
other
words
to
the
effect
of
habit
finally
he
held
that
characters
acquired
by
an
existing
individual
might
be
transmitted
to
its
offspring
in
wells
read
before
the
royal
society
an
account
of
a
white
female
part
of
whose
skin
resembles
that
of
a
negro
in
this
paper
the
author
distinctly
recognized
the
principle
of
natural
selection
but
applied
it
only
to
the
races
of
man
and
in
man
only
to
certain
characters
after
remarking
that
negroes
and
mulattoes
enjoy
an
immunity
from
certain
tropical
diseases
he
observed
first
that
all
animals
tend
to
vary
in
some
degree
and
secondly
that
agriculturalists
improve
their
domesticated
animals
by
selection
he
added
that
what
is
done
in
the
latter
case
by
art
seems
to
be
done
with
equal
efficacy
though
more
slowly
by
nature
in
the
formation
of
varieties
of
mankind
fitted
for
the
countries
which
they
inhabit
again
in
patrick
matthew
published
a
work
on
naval
timber
and
arboriculture
in
which
he
put
forth
precisely
the
same
view
concerning
the
origin
of
species
as
that
propounded
by
wallace
and
by
darwin
unfortunately
for
himself
the
view
was
cursorily
suggested
in
scattered
passages
of
an
appendix
to
a
work
on
a
different
subject
so
that
it
remained
unnoticed
until
matthew
himself
drew
attention
to
it
in
after
the
publication
of
the
origin
of
species
we
observe
finally
that
herbert
spencer
in
an
essay
published
in
and
republished
six
years
later
contrasted
the
theories
of
the
creation
and
the
development
of
organic
beings
he
argued
from
the
analogy
of
domestic
productions
from
the
changes
which
the
embryos
of
many
species
undergo
from
the
difficulty
of
distinguishing
species
and
varieties
and
from
the
principle
of
general
gradation
that
species
have
been
modified
and
he
attributed
the
modification
to
the
change
of
circumstances
the
two
volumes
comprising
the
origin
of
species
constitute
as
the
author
said
one
long
argument
it
is
of
course
impossible
in
the
space
at
our
command
to
recapitulate
in
detail
even
the
leading
facts
and
inferences
which
are
brought
forward
to
prove
that
species
have
been
modified
during
a
long
course
of
descent
we
must
confine
ourselves
to
a
succinct
statement
of
the
author
general
conclusions
what
he
undertakes
to
prove
is
that
the
modification
of
species
during
a
long
course
of
descent
has
been
effected
chiefly
through
the
natural
selection
of
numerous
successive
slight
favorable
variations
aided
in
an
important
manner
by
the
inherited
effects
of
the
use
and
disuse
of
parts
and
in
an
unimportant
manner
that
is
in
relation
to
adaptive
structures
whether
past
or
present
by
the
direct
action
of
external
conditions
and
by
variations
which
seem
to
us
in
our
ignorance
to
arise
spontaneously
it
should
be
observed
that
darwin
does
not
attribute
the
modification
exclusively
to
natural
selection
what
he
asserts
is
i
am
convinced
that
natural
selection
has
been
the
main
but
not
the
exclusive
means
of
modification
he
submits
that
a
false
theory
would
hardly
explain
in
so
satisfactory
a
manner
as
does
the
theory
of
natural
selection
the
several
large
classes
of
facts
marshalled
in
the
two
volumes
now
under
review
if
it
be
objected
that
this
is
an
unsafe
method
of
arguing
darwin
rejoins
that
it
is
a
method
usual
in
judging
of
the
common
events
of
life
and
has
often
been
used
by
the
greatest
natural
philosophers
the
undulatory
theory
of
light
for
instance
has
thus
been
arrived
at
and
the
belief
in
the
revolution
of
the
earth
on
its
own
axis
was
until
lately
supported
by
scarcely
any
direct
evidence
it
is
no
valid
objection
to
the
darwinian
theory
of
the
origin
of
species
that
science
as
yet
throws
no
light
on
the
far
higher
problem
of
the
essence
or
origin
of
life
neither
has
any
one
explained
what
is
the
essence
of
the
attraction
of
gravity
though
nobody
now
objects
to
following
out
the
results
consequent
on
this
unknown
element
of
attraction
why
it
may
be
asked
did
nearly
all
the
most
eminent
naturalists
and
geologists
until
recently
decline
to
believe
in
the
mutability
of
species
darwin
replies
that
the
belief
that
species
were
immutable
productions
was
almost
unavoidable
as
long
as
the
history
of
the
world
was
thought
to
be
of
short
duration
even
now
that
we
have
acquired
some
idea
of
the
lapse
of
time
men
are
too
apt
to
assume
without
proof
that
the
geological
record
is
so
perfect
that
it
would
have
afforded
plain
evidence
of
the
mutation
of
species
if
they
had
really
undergone
mutation
the
chief
cause
however
of
the
unwillingness
to
admit
that
one
species
has
given
birth
to
other
and
distinct
species
is
the
fact
that
men
are
slow
to
admit
great
changes
of
which
they
do
not
see
the
steps
the
difficulty
is
the
same
which
was
experienced
by
many
geologists
when
lyell
first
insisted
that
long
lines
of
inland
cliffs
had
been
formed
and
great
valleys
excavated
not
by
catastrophes
but
by
the
agencies
which
we
see
still
at
work
the
human
mind
can
not
grasp
the
full
meaning
of
the
term
of
even
a
million
years
can
not
add
up
and
perceive
the
full
effects
of
many
slight
variations
accumulated
during
an
almost
infinite
number
of
generations
when
the
first
edition
of
the
origin
of
species
was
published
in
darwin
wrote
that
he
by
no
means
expected
to
convince
experienced
naturalists
whose
minds
were
stocked
with
a
multitude
of
facts
all
regarded
during
a
long
course
of
years
from
a
point
of
view
directly
opposite
to
his
he
looked
forward
with
confidence
however
to
the
future
to
young
and
rising
naturalists
who
would
be
able
to
view
both
sides
of
the
question
with
impartiality
he
predicted
that
when
the
conclusions
reached
by
him
and
by
wallace
concerning
the
origin
of
species
should
be
generally
accepted
there
would
be
a
considerable
revolution
in
natural
history
naturalists
for
instance
would
be
forced
to
acknowledge
that
the
only
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
is
that
the
latter
are
known
or
believed
to
be
connected
at
the
present
day
by
intermediate
gradations
whereas
species
were
formerly
though
they
are
not
now
thus
connected
it
might
thus
come
to
pass
that
forms
generally
acknowledged
in
to
be
merely
varieties
would
thereafter
be
thought
worthy
of
specific
names
in
which
case
scientific
and
common
language
would
come
into
accordance
in
short
darwin
looked
forward
to
the
time
when
species
would
have
to
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
genera
are
treated
by
those
naturalists
who
admit
that
genera
are
merely
artificial
combinations
made
for
convenience
darwin
also
foresaw
that
when
his
theory
of
the
origin
of
species
should
be
adopted
other
and
more
general
departments
of
natural
history
would
rise
greatly
in
interest
the
terms
used
by
naturalists
such
terms
as
affinity
relationship
community
of
type
paternity
morphology
adaptive
characters
rudimentary
and
abortive
organs
would
cease
to
be
metaphorical
and
would
have
a
plain
signification
when
he
wrote
we
no
longer
look
at
an
organic
being
as
a
savage
looks
at
a
ship
as
something
wholly
beyond
his
comprehension
when
we
regard
every
production
of
nature
as
one
which
has
had
a
long
history
when
we
contemplate
every
complex
structure
and
instinct
as
the
summing
up
of
many
contrivances
each
useful
to
the
possessor
in
the
same
way
as
any
great
mechanical
invention
is
the
summing
up
of
the
labor
the
experience
the
reason
and
even
the
blunders
of
numerous
workmen
when
we
thus
view
each
organic
being
how
far
more
interesting
i
speak
from
experience
does
the
study
of
natural
history
become
once
more
when
we
can
feel
assured
that
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
and
all
the
closely
allied
species
of
most
genera
have
within
a
not
very
remote
period
descended
from
one
parent
and
have
migrated
from
some
one
birthplace
and
when
we
better
know
the
many
means
of
migration
then
by
the
light
which
geology
now
throws
and
will
continue
to
throw
on
former
changes
of
climate
and
of
the
level
of
the
land
we
shall
surely
be
enabled
to
trace
in
an
admirable
manner
the
former
migrations
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
whole
world
when
darwin
published
the
origin
of
species
he
was
aware
that
theologians
and
philosophers
seemed
to
be
fully
satisfied
with
the
view
that
each
species
had
been
independently
created
and
was
immutable
to
his
own
mind
however
it
accorded
better
with
what
was
known
of
the
laws
impressed
on
matter
by
the
creator
that
the
production
and
extinction
of
the
past
and
present
inhabitants
of
the
world
should
have
been
due
to
secondary
causes
like
those
determining
the
birth
and
death
of
the
individual
when
i
view
he
said
all
beings
not
as
special
creations
but
as
the
lineal
descendants
of
some
few
beings
which
lived
long
before
the
first
bed
of
the
cambrian
system
was
deposited
they
seem
to
me
to
become
ennobled
and
again
as
all
the
living
forms
of
life
are
the
lineal
descendants
of
those
which
lived
long
before
the
cambrian
epoch
we
may
feel
certain
that
the
ordinary
succession
by
generation
has
never
once
been
broken
and
that
no
cataclysm
has
desolated
the
whole
world
hence
we
may
look
with
some
confidence
to
a
secure
future
of
great
length
and
as
natural
selection
works
slowly
by
and
for
the
good
of
each
being
all
corporeal
and
mental
endowments
will
tend
to
progress
towards
perfection
for
his
own
part
darwin
could
see
no
good
reason
why
the
views
propounded
in
the
two
volumes
comprising
the
origin
of
species
should
shock
the
religious
feelings
of
any
one
touching
the
likelihood
of
such
a
result
he
reassured
himself
by
recalling
the
fact
that
the
greatest
discovery
ever
made
by
man
namely
the
law
of
the
attraction
of
gravitation
was
attacked
by
leibnitz
as
subversive
of
natural
and
inferentially
of
revealed
religion
darwin
was
confident
that
if
any
such
impressions
were
made
by
his
theory
they
would
prove
but
transient
and
that
ultimately
men
would
come
to
see
that
it
is
just
as
noble
a
conception
of
the
deity
to
believe
that
he
created
a
few
original
forms
capable
of
into
other
and
needful
forms
as
to
believe
that
it
required
the
fresh
act
of
creation
to
supply
the
voids
caused
by
the
action
of
his
laws
iv
it
was
as
we
have
said
in
that
darwin
published
the
two
volumes
collectively
entitled
variation
of
animals
and
plants
under
domestication
it
is
the
second
and
largely
corrected
edition
brought
out
in
which
we
have
under
our
eye
it
is
the
outcome
of
the
views
maintained
by
the
author
in
this
work
and
elsewhere
that
not
only
the
various
domestic
races
but
the
most
distinct
genera
and
orders
within
the
same
great
class
for
instance
mammals
birds
reptiles
and
fishes
are
all
the
descendants
of
one
common
progenitor
and
the
whole
vast
amount
of
difference
between
these
forms
has
primarily
arisen
from
simple
variability
darwin
recognized
that
he
who
for
the
first
time
should
consider
the
subject
under
this
point
of
view
would
be
struck
dumb
with
amazement
he
submits
however
that
the
amazement
ought
to
be
lessened
when
we
reflect
that
beings
almost
infinite
in
number
during
an
almost
infinite
lapse
of
time
have
often
had
their
whole
organization
rendered
in
some
degree
plastic
and
that
each
slight
modification
of
structure
which
was
in
any
way
beneficial
under
excessively
complex
conditions
of
life
has
been
preserved
whilst
each
which
was
in
any
way
injurious
has
been
rigorously
destroyed
the
accumulation
of
beneficial
variations
will
infallibly
have
led
to
structures
as
diversified
as
beautifully
adapted
for
various
purposes
and
as
excellently
as
we
see
in
the
animals
and
plants
around
us
hence
darwin
regards
selection
as
the
paramount
power
whether
applied
by
man
to
the
formation
of
domestic
beings
or
by
nature
to
the
production
of
species
employing
a
favorite
metaphor
he
said
if
an
architect
were
to
rear
a
noble
and
commodious
edifice
without
the
use
of
cut
stone
by
selecting
from
the
fragments
at
the
base
of
a
precipice
stones
for
his
arches
elongated
stones
for
his
lintels
and
flat
stones
for
his
roof
we
should
admire
his
skill
and
regard
him
as
the
paramount
power
now
the
fragments
of
stone
though
indispensable
to
the
architect
bear
to
the
edifice
built
by
him
the
same
relation
which
the
fluctuating
variations
of
organic
beings
bear
to
the
varied
and
admirable
structures
ultimately
acquired
by
their
modified
descendants
some
critics
of
the
darwinian
theory
of
the
origin
of
species
have
declared
that
natural
selection
explains
nothing
unless
the
precise
cause
of
each
slight
individual
difference
be
made
clear
darwin
rejoins
that
if
it
were
explained
to
a
savage
utterly
ignorant
of
the
art
of
building
how
the
edifice
had
been
raised
stone
upon
stone
and
why
fragments
were
used
for
the
arches
flat
stones
for
the
roof
etc
and
if
the
use
of
each
part
and
of
the
whole
building
were
pointed
out
it
would
be
unreasonable
if
he
declared
that
nothing
had
been
made
clear
to
him
because
the
precise
cause
of
the
shape
of
each
fragment
could
not
be
told
this
in
darwin
opinion
is
a
nearly
parallel
case
with
the
objection
that
selection
explains
nothing
because
we
know
not
the
cause
of
each
individual
difference
in
the
structure
of
each
being
the
shape
of
the
fragments
of
stone
at
the
base
of
the
hypothetical
precipice
may
be
called
accidental
but
the
term
is
not
strictly
applicable
for
the
shape
of
each
depends
on
a
long
sequence
of
events
all
obeying
natural
laws
on
the
nature
of
the
rock
on
the
lines
of
deposition
or
cleavage
on
the
form
of
the
mountain
which
depends
on
its
upheaval
and
subsequent
denudation
and
lastly
on
the
storm
or
earthquake
which
throws
down
the
fragments
in
regard
to
the
use
however
to
which
the
fragments
may
be
put
their
shape
may
be
strictly
said
to
be
accidental
here
darwin
acknowledged
that
we
are
brought
face
to
face
with
a
great
difficulty
in
alluding
to
which
he
felt
that
he
was
travelling
beyond
his
proper
province
an
omniscient
creator
must
have
foreseen
every
consequence
which
results
from
the
laws
imposed
by
him
but
can
it
be
reasonably
maintained
that
the
creator
intentionally
ordered
if
we
use
the
words
in
any
ordinary
sense
that
certain
fragments
of
rock
should
assume
certain
shapes
so
that
the
builder
might
erect
his
edifice
if
the
various
laws
which
have
determined
the
shape
of
each
fragment
were
not
predetermined
for
the
builder
sake
can
it
be
maintained
with
any
greater
probability
that
he
specially
ordained
for
the
sake
of
the
breeder
each
of
the
innumerable
variations
in
our
domestic
animals
and
plants
many
of
these
variations
being
of
no
service
to
man
and
not
beneficial
far
more
often
injurious
to
the
creatures
themselves
did
he
ordain
that
the
crop
and
of
the
pigeon
should
vary
in
order
that
the
fancier
might
make
his
grotesque
pouter
and
breeds
did
he
cause
the
frame
and
mental
qualities
of
the
dog
to
vary
in
order
that
a
breed
might
be
formed
of
indomitable
ferocity
with
jaws
fitted
to
pin
down
the
bull
for
man
brutal
sport
it
is
obvious
however
that
if
we
give
up
the
principle
in
one
case
if
we
do
not
admit
that
the
variations
of
the
primeval
dog
were
intentionally
guided
in
order
that
the
greyhound
for
instance
that
perfect
image
of
symmetry
and
vigor
might
be
formed
no
shadow
of
reason
can
be
assigned
for
the
belief
that
variations
similar
in
nature
and
the
result
of
the
same
general
laws
which
have
been
the
groundwork
through
natural
selection
of
the
formation
of
the
most
perfectly
adapted
animals
in
the
world
man
included
were
intentionally
and
specially
guided
darwin
therefore
was
unable
to
follow
the
distinguished
botanist
asa
gray
in
his
belief
that
variation
has
been
led
along
certain
beneficial
lines
like
a
stream
along
definite
and
useful
lines
of
irrigation
darwin
conclusion
was
that
if
we
assume
that
each
particular
variation
was
from
the
beginning
of
all
time
preordained
then
that
plasticity
of
organization
which
leads
to
many
injurious
deviations
of
structure
as
well
as
the
redundant
power
of
reproduction
which
inevitably
leads
to
a
struggle
for
existence
and
as
a
consequence
to
a
natural
selection
or
survival
of
the
fittest
must
appear
to
us
superfluous
laws
of
nature
next
to
the
origin
of
species
the
volume
which
sets
forth
theory
of
the
descent
of
man
naturally
excited
the
most
widespread
attention
this
book
which
took
the
author
three
years
to
write
was
published
in
a
second
and
carefully
revised
edition
appearing
three
years
later
the
data
brought
together
occupy
more
than
six
hundred
pages
the
conclusions
reached
may
be
summed
up
in
a
few
paragraphs
the
principal
induction
from
the
evidence
is
that
man
is
descended
from
some
less
highly
organized
form
it
was
conviction
that
the
grounds
upon
which
this
conclusion
rests
will
never
be
shaken
for
the
close
similarity
between
man
and
the
lower
animals
in
embryonic
development
as
well
as
in
innumerable
points
of
structure
and
constitution
both
of
high
and
of
the
most
trifling
importance
the
rudiments
which
he
retains
and
the
abnormal
reversions
to
which
he
is
occasionally
liable
are
facts
which
can
not
be
disputed
viewed
in
the
light
of
our
knowledge
of
the
whole
organic
world
their
meaning
is
unmistakable
the
great
principle
of
evolution
stands
out
clear
and
firm
when
these
groups
of
facts
are
considered
in
connection
with
others
such
as
the
mutual
affinities
of
the
members
of
the
same
group
their
geographical
distribution
in
past
and
present
times
and
their
geological
succession
it
is
pronounced
incredible
that
all
these
facts
should
speak
falsely
he
who
is
not
content
to
look
like
a
savage
at
the
phenomena
of
nature
as
disconnected
can
not
any
longer
believe
that
man
is
the
product
of
a
separate
act
of
creation
he
will
be
forced
to
admit
that
the
close
resemblance
of
the
embryo
of
man
to
that
for
instance
of
a
dog
the
construction
of
his
skull
limbs
and
whole
frame
on
the
same
plan
with
that
of
other
mammals
independently
of
the
uses
to
which
the
parts
may
be
put
the
occasional
reappearance
of
various
structures
for
instance
of
several
muscles
which
man
does
not
normally
possess
but
which
are
common
to
the
quadrumana
and
a
crowd
of
analogous
facts
all
point
in
the
plainest
manner
to
the
conclusion
that
man
is
the
with
other
mammals
of
a
common
progenitor
darwin
recognized
that
the
high
standard
of
our
intellectual
powers
and
moral
disposition
constitutes
the
greatest
difficulty
which
presents
itself
after
we
have
been
driven
by
the
mass
of
biological
evidence
to
accept
his
conclusion
as
to
the
origin
of
man
touching
this
point
he
observes
every
one
who
admits
the
principle
of
evolution
must
see
that
the
mental
powers
of
the
higher
animals
which
are
the
same
in
kind
with
those
of
man
though
so
different
in
degree
are
capable
of
advancement
thus
the
interval
between
the
mental
powers
of
one
of
the
higher
apes
and
of
a
fish
or
between
those
of
an
ant
and
is
immense
yet
their
development
does
not
offer
any
special
difficulty
for
with
our
domesticated
animals
the
mental
faculties
are
certainly
variable
and
the
variations
are
inherited
no
one
doubts
that
their
mental
faculties
are
of
the
utmost
importance
to
animals
in
a
state
of
nature
therefore
the
conditions
are
favorable
for
their
development
through
natural
selection
the
same
conclusion
may
be
extended
to
man
the
intellect
must
have
been
to
him
even
at
a
very
remote
period
as
enabling
him
to
invent
and
use
language
to
make
weapons
tools
traps
whereby
with
the
aid
of
his
social
habits
he
long
ago
became
the
most
dominant
of
all
living
creatures
it
is
further
pointed
out
that
a
great
stride
in
the
development
of
man
intellect
must
have
followed
as
soon
as
the
and
of
language
came
into
use
for
the
continued
use
of
language
must
have
reacted
on
the
brain
and
produced
an
inherited
effect
and
this
again
will
have
reacted
on
the
improvement
of
language
the
largeness
of
the
brain
in
man
relatively
to
his
body
compared
with
the
size
of
that
organ
in
the
lower
animals
is
attributable
in
chief
part
to
the
early
use
of
some
simple
form
of
language
that
engine
which
affixes
signs
to
all
sorts
of
objects
and
qualities
and
excites
trains
of
thought
which
would
never
arise
from
the
mere
impression
of
the
senses
or
if
they
did
arise
could
not
be
followed
out
the
higher
intellectual
powers
of
man
such
as
those
of
ratiocination
abstraction
probably
follow
from
the
continued
improvement
and
exercise
of
the
other
mental
faculties
how
man
moral
qualities
came
to
be
developed
is
an
interesting
problem
which
is
considered
by
darwin
at
some
length
he
holds
that
their
foundation
lies
in
the
social
instincts
under
which
term
are
included
family
ties
these
instincts
are
highly
complex
and
in
the
case
of
the
lower
animals
give
special
tendencies
toward
certain
definite
actions
but
the
more
important
elements
are
love
and
the
distinct
emotion
of
sympathy
animals
endowed
with
the
social
instincts
take
pleasure
in
one
another
company
warn
one
another
of
danger
defend
and
aid
one
another
in
many
ways
these
instincts
do
not
extend
to
all
the
individuals
of
the
species
but
only
to
those
of
the
same
community
as
however
they
are
highly
beneficial
to
the
species
they
have
in
all
probability
been
acquired
through
natural
selection
in
judgment
the
moral
nature
of
man
has
reached
its
present
standard
partly
through
the
advancement
of
his
reasoning
powers
and
consequently
of
a
just
public
opinion
but
especially
from
his
sympathies
having
been
rendered
more
tender
and
widely
diffused
through
the
effects
of
habit
example
instruction
and
reflection
it
is
pronounced
not
improbable
that
after
long
practice
virtuous
tendencies
may
be
inherited
let
us
look
a
little
more
closely
at
the
matter
for
the
difficulty
of
explaining
morality
forms
one
of
the
greatest
obstacles
to
the
acceptance
of
the
darwinian
account
of
the
descent
of
man
what
do
we
mean
by
a
moral
being
manifestly
a
moral
being
is
one
who
is
capable
of
reflecting
on
his
past
actions
and
their
motives
and
of
approving
of
some
while
he
disapproves
of
others
man
is
the
one
being
who
certainly
deserves
this
designation
though
attempts
have
recently
been
made
to
show
that
a
rudimentary
morality
may
be
traced
in
some
of
the
lower
animals
in
the
fourth
chapter
of
the
book
before
us
darwin
undertakes
to
demonstrate
that
the
moral
sense
follows
first
from
the
enduring
and
nature
of
the
social
instincts
secondly
from
appreciation
of
the
approbation
and
disapprobation
of
his
fellows
and
thirdly
from
the
high
activity
of
his
mental
faculties
with
past
impressions
extremely
vivid
in
these
latter
respects
he
differs
from
the
lower
animals
owing
to
this
condition
of
mind
man
can
not
avoid
looking
both
backwards
and
forwards
and
comparing
past
impressions
hence
after
some
temporary
desire
or
passion
has
mastered
his
social
instincts
he
reflects
and
compares
the
now
weakened
impression
of
such
past
impulses
with
the
social
instincts
and
he
then
feels
that
sense
of
dissatisfaction
which
all
unsatisfied
instincts
leave
behind
them
and
resolves
to
act
differently
for
the
future
this
dissatisfaction
darwin
would
identify
with
conscience
any
instinct
permanently
stronger
or
more
enduring
than
another
gives
rise
to
a
feeling
which
we
express
by
saying
that
it
to
be
obeyed
darwin
suggests
that
a
pointer
dog
if
able
to
reflect
on
his
past
conduct
would
say
to
himself
i
as
indeed
we
say
of
him
to
have
pointed
at
that
hare
and
not
have
yielded
to
the
passing
temptation
of
hunting
it
the
belief
in
god
has
often
been
advanced
as
not
only
the
greatest
but
the
most
decisive
of
all
the
distinctions
between
man
and
the
lower
animals
darwin
brings
forward
in
the
book
before
us
a
quantity
of
reasons
for
holding
it
to
be
impossible
that
this
belief
is
innate
or
instinctive
in
man
in
some
races
of
men
for
instance
we
encounter
a
total
want
of
the
idea
of
god
on
the
other
hand
a
belief
in
spiritual
agencies
seems
to
be
universal
and
apparently
follows
from
a
considerable
advance
in
man
reason
and
from
a
still
greater
advance
in
the
faculties
of
imagination
curiosity
and
wonder
i
am
aware
says
darwin
that
the
assumed
instinctive
belief
in
god
has
been
used
by
many
persons
as
an
argument
for
his
existence
but
this
is
a
rash
argument
as
we
should
thus
be
compelled
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
many
cruel
and
malignant
spirits
only
a
little
more
powerful
than
man
for
the
belief
in
them
is
far
more
general
than
in
a
beneficent
deity
the
idea
of
a
universal
and
beneficent
creator
does
not
seem
to
arise
in
the
mind
of
man
until
he
has
been
elevated
by
culture
how
does
the
belief
in
the
advancement
of
man
from
some
low
organized
form
bear
on
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
sir
john
lubbock
has
proved
that
the
barbarous
races
of
man
possess
no
clear
belief
of
the
kind
but
as
darwin
continually
reminds
us
arguments
derived
from
the
primeval
beliefs
of
savages
are
of
little
or
no
avail
on
either
side
of
a
question
attention
is
directed
by
darwin
to
the
more
relevant
fact
that
few
persons
feel
any
anxiety
from
the
impossibility
of
determining
at
what
precise
period
in
the
development
of
the
individual
from
the
first
trace
of
a
minute
germinal
vesicle
man
becomes
an
immortal
being
he
submits
that
there
should
be
no
greater
cause
for
anxiety
because
the
period
can
not
possibly
be
determined
in
the
gradually
ascending
organic
scale
darwin
was
well
aware
that
the
conclusions
arrived
at
in
the
work
before
us
namely
that
man
is
descended
from
some
lowly
organized
form
would
be
highly
distasteful
to
many
the
very
persons
however
who
regard
the
conclusions
with
distaste
admit
without
hesitation
that
they
are
descended
from
barbarians
darwin
recalls
the
astonishment
which
he
himself
felt
on
first
seeing
a
party
of
fuegians
on
a
wild
and
broken
shore
when
the
reflection
rushed
upon
his
mind
that
such
men
had
been
his
ancestors
these
men
were
absolutely
naked
and
bedaubed
with
paint
their
long
hair
was
tangled
their
mouths
frothed
with
excitement
and
their
expression
was
wild
startled
and
distrustful
they
possessed
hardly
any
arts
and
like
wild
animals
lived
on
what
they
could
catch
they
had
no
government
and
were
merciless
to
every
one
not
of
their
own
small
tribe
remembering
the
impression
made
on
him
by
the
fuegians
darwin
suggests
that
he
who
has
seen
a
savage
in
his
native
land
will
not
feel
much
shame
if
forced
to
acknowledge
that
the
blood
of
some
more
humble
creature
flows
in
his
veins
for
my
own
part
he
says
i
would
as
soon
be
descended
from
that
heroic
little
monkey
who
braved
his
dreaded
enemy
in
order
to
save
the
life
of
his
keeper
or
from
that
old
baboon
who
descending
from
the
mountains
carried
away
in
triumph
his
young
comrade
from
a
crowd
of
astonished
dogs
as
from
a
savage
who
delights
to
torture
his
enemies
offers
up
bloody
sacrifices
practises
infanticide
without
remorse
treats
his
wives
like
slaves
knows
no
decency
and
is
haunted
by
the
grossest
superstitions
darwin
holds
in
fine
that
man
may
be
excused
for
feeling
some
pride
at
having
risen
though
not
through
his
own
exertions
to
the
very
summit
of
the
organic
scale
it
is
further
submitted
that
the
fact
of
his
having
thus
risen
instead
of
having
been
aboriginally
placed
there
may
give
him
hope
for
a
still
higher
destiny
in
the
distant
future
as
a
scientist
however
darwin
is
not
concerned
with
hopes
or
fears
but
simply
with
the
truth
as
man
reason
enables
him
to
discern
it
we
must
recognize
he
thinks
as
the
truth
established
by
an
overwhelming
array
of
inductive
evidence
that
man
with
all
his
noble
qualities
with
sympathy
which
he
feels
for
the
most
debased
with
benevolence
which
extends
not
only
to
other
men
but
to
the
humblest
living
creature
with
his
godlike
intellect
which
has
penetrated
into
the
movements
and
constitution
of
the
solar
system
with
all
these
exalted
powers
man
still
bears
in
his
bodily
frame
the
indelible
stamp
of
his
lowly
origin
vi
we
have
said
that
darwin
theory
of
the
origin
of
species
together
with
its
corollary
the
descent
of
man
has
met
with
almost
universal
acceptance
by
scientists
we
have
to
use
the
qualifying
adverb
because
some
of
darwin
contemporaries
including
virchow
and
owen
not
to
mention
george
mivart
and
the
duke
of
argyll
have
withheld
their
adhesion
since
his
death
moreover
his
disciples
have
tended
to
split
into
two
schools
on
the
one
hand
weismann
has
rejected
the
lamarckian
factors
the
effect
of
use
and
disuse
upon
organs
and
the
transmissibility
of
acquired
characters
the
importance
of
these
factors
has
been
emphatically
on
the
other
hand
by
lankester
and
others
whether
biologists
however
range
themselves
in
the
or
in
the
camp
the
value
of
the
principle
of
natural
selection
is
acknowledged
by
all
and

engineers
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
and
of
the
century
which
witnessed
such
mighty
advances
along
all
engineering
lines
the
imprint
left
by
ericsson
life
on
the
engineering
practice
of
his
age
was
deep
and
lasting
and
if
one
may
dare
look
into
the
future
the
day
is
far
removed
when
engineers
will
have
passed
beyond
their
dependence
on
his
life
and
labors
it
is
perhaps
not
amiss
that
before
looking
more
closely
at
the
achievements
of
ericsson
life
and
activity
note
should
be
taken
of
the
large
dependence
of
our
present
civilization
and
mode
of
life
on
the
engineer
and
his
work
in
different
ages
of
the
world
history
each
has
received
its
name
appropriate
or
fanciful
as
the
case
may
have
been
for
the
modern
age
no
name
is
perhaps
more
adequately
descriptive
than
the
age
of
energy
the
age
in
which
our
entire
fabric
of
civilization
rests
upon
the
utilization
of
the
energies
of
nature
for
the
needs
of
humanity
and
to
an
extent
little
appreciated
by
those
who
have
not
considered
the
matter
from
this
point
of
view
if
we
consider
the
various
elements
which
enter
into
our
modern
civilization
the
items
which
enter
into
the
daily
life
of
the
average
man
or
woman
the
items
which
we
have
come
to
consider
as
necessities
and
those
which
we
may
consider
as
luxuries
the
items
which
go
to
make
up
our
needs
as
expressed
in
terms
of
shelter
food
intercommunication
between
man
and
his
fellow
and
pleasure
the
most
casual
consideration
of
such
will
serve
to
show
distributed
throughout
almost
the
entire
fabric
of
our
civilization
dependence
at
some
point
on
the
power
of
the
the
or
windmill
the
subtle
electric
current
or
the
of
coal
petroleum
oil
or
natural
gas
the
harnessing
and
efficient
utilization
of
these
great
natural
energies
is
the
direct
function
of
the
engineer
or
more
especially
of
the
dynamic
engineer
and
in
this
noble
guild
of
workers
ericsson
carved
for
himself
an
enduring
place
and
left
behind
a
record
which
should
serve
as
an
inspiration
to
all
who
are
following
the
same
pathway
in
later
years
no
one
feature
perhaps
better
differentiates
our
modern
civilization
from
that
of
earlier
times
four
hundred
years
ago
or
even
one
hundred
than
that
of
intercommunication
between
man
and
his
fellow
compare
the
opportunities
for
such
intercommunication
in
the
present
with
those
in
the
time
of
queen
elizabeth
sir
isaac
newton
george
washington
or
napoleon
i
we
now
have
our
steamships
steam
and
electric
railroads
cable
telegraph
and
telephone
a
few
years
ago
not
a
single
one
was
known
the
modern
age
is
one
which
demands
the
utmost
in
the
possibility
of
communication
between
man
and
his
kind
and
in
this
respect
the
wide
world
is
now
smaller
than
the
confines
of
an
english
county
a
century
ago
in
this
field
as
we
shall
see
ericsson
did
some
of
his
greatest
work
and
left
perhaps
his
most
permanent
record
for
the
future
ericsson
life
falls
most
naturally
into
three
periods
chronologically
or
geographically
and
likewise
into
three
periods
professionally
though
the
latter
mode
of
subdivision
has
by
no
means
the
same
boundaries
as
the
former
the
first
mode
of
subdivision
gives
us
the
life
in
sweden
the
life
in
england
and
the
life
in
the
united
states
the
second
mode
gives
us
the
life
of
struggle
and
obscurity
the
life
of
struggle
achievement
and
recognition
and
the
calmer
and
easier
life
of
declining
years
with
recognition
reward
and
the
assurance
of
a
life
work
well
done
john
ericsson
was
born
in
the
province
of
vermland
sweden
in
his
father
was
olof
ericsson
a
mine
owner
and
inspector
who
was
well
educated
after
the
standard
of
his
times
having
graduated
at
the
college
in
karlstad
the
principal
town
of
the
province
his
mother
was
britta
sophia
yngstrom
a
woman
of
descent
and
to
whom
ericsson
seems
to
have
owed
many
of
his
stronger
characteristics
three
children
were
born
caroline
in
nils
in
and
john
in
of
john
earliest
boyhood
we
have
but
slight
record
but
there
seems
to
have
been
a
clear
foreshadowing
of
his
future
genius
he
was
considered
the
wonder
of
the
neighborhood
and
busied
himself
day
after
day
with
the
machinery
of
the
mines
drawing
the
form
on
paper
with
his
rude
tools
or
making
models
with
bits
of
wood
and
cord
and
endeavoring
thus
to
trace
the
mystery
of
its
operation
in
the
ericsson
family
fell
upon
evil
times
due
to
a
war
with
russia
business
became
disturbed
and
in
the
end
olof
ericsson
became
financially
ruined
this
brought
the
little
family
face
to
face
with
the
realities
of
life
and
we
soon
after
find
the
father
occupying
a
position
as
inspector
on
the
göta
canal
a
project
which
was
just
then
occupying
serious
attention
after
having
been
neglected
for
nearly
one
hundred
years
and
nearly
three
hundred
years
after
it
was
first
proposed
in
through
this
connection
in
john
and
nils
ericsson
were
appointed
as
cadets
in
a
corps
of
mechanical
engineers
to
be
employed
in
carrying
out
the
government
plans
with
reference
to
the
canal
during
the
winter
of
and
at
the
age
of
thirteen
john
ericsson
received
regular
instruction
from
some
of
his
officers
in
algebra
chemistry
field
drawing
and
geometry
and
the
english
language
ericsson
education
previous
to
this
seems
to
have
consisted
chiefly
in
lessons
at
home
or
from
tutors
after
the
manner
of
the
time
he
had
thus
received
instruction
in
the
ordinary
branches
and
in
drawing
and
some
chemistry
his
training
in
drawing
seems
to
have
been
unusually
thorough
and
comprehensive
and
with
a
natural
genius
for
such
work
his
later
remarkable
skill
at
the
drawing
board
is
doubtless
in
no
small
measure
due
to
the
excellent
instruction
which
he
received
in
his
early
years
his
progress
in
his
duties
as
a
young
engineer
was
rapid
and
he
was
soon
given
employment
in
connection
with
the
involving
much
responsibility
and
calling
for
experience
and
skill
at
length
on
reaching
the
age
of
seventeen
he
became
stirred
with
military
ambition
and
dissatisfied
with
his
present
prospects
he
left
his
position
with
its
opportunities
for
the
future
and
entered
the
swedish
army
as
ensign
of
a
regiment
of
field
chasseurs
this
regiment
was
famous
for
its
rifle
practice
and
ericsson
was
soon
one
of
its
most
expert
marksmen
the
routine
of
army
life
was
however
far
from
being
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
uneasy
genius
of
john
ericsson
and
we
soon
find
him
engaged
in
topographical
surveying
for
the
government
and
so
rapid
and
industrious
in
his
work
that
as
the
surveyors
were
paid
in
accordance
with
the
amount
accomplished
he
was
carried
on
the
pay
rolls
as
two
men
and
paid
as
such
in
order
that
the
amount
which
he
received
might
not
seem
too
excessive
for
one
individual
even
this
was
not
sufficient
to
exhaust
his
energy
and
about
this
time
he
conceived
the
idea
of
publishing
a
book
of
plates
descriptive
of
the
machinery
commonly
employed
in
the
mining
operations
of
his
day
to
this
end
he
collected
a
large
number
of
sketches
which
he
had
prepared
in
his
earlier
years
and
made
arrangements
to
take
up
the
work
of
preparation
for
publication
the
drawings
selected
were
to
be
engraved
for
the
book
and
nothing
daunted
by
the
undertaking
ericsson
proposed
to
do
this
work
himself
after
some
discouragement
the
engraving
was
undertaken
and
eighteen
copper
plates
of
the
selected
averaging
in
size
fifteen
by
twenty
inches
were
completed
within
a
year
in
various
ways
the
project
met
with
delays
and
it
soon
became
apparent
that
the
rapid
advance
in
the
applications
of
machinery
to
mining
would
render
the
work
out
of
date
and
it
was
at
length
abandoned
at
about
this
time
ericsson
seems
to
have
taken
up
seriously
his
work
on
his
certain
experiments
made
by
his
father
having
suggested
to
him
the
hope
that
a
source
of
power
might
in
this
way
be
developed
which
would
be
more
economical
than
the
at
this
point
we
see
entering
into
ericsson
life
an
idea
which
never
left
him
which
controlled
much
of
his
work
in
and
which
attracted
no
small
part
of
his
attention
throughout
his
closing
years
this
idea
was
the
discovery
of
some
form
of
which
should
be
more
economical
than
the
especially
as
it
was
in
his
day
the
idea
grew
rapidly
and
soon
absorbed
his
chief
attention
military
life
now
lost
its
attraction
and
in
obtaining
leave
of
absence
he
left
his
native
land
and
turned
his
face
toward
london
doubtless
with
the
hope
strong
within
him
that
a
substitute
for
the
had
been
found
and
that
his
future
lay
secure
and
easy
before
him
the
characteristic
features
of
ericsson
life
up
to
this
time
when
he
had
reached
his
year
are
energy
industry
independence
all
in
most
pronounced
degree
and
combined
with
a
most
astonishing
insight
into
mechanical
and
scientific
questions
it
was
not
a
period
of
achievement
but
one
of
formation
and
of
development
in
those
qualities
which
were
soon
to
make
him
famous
in
both
worlds
of
his
work
during
this
period
of
life
little
or
nothing
outside
the
idea
embodied
in
the
can
be
said
to
belong
to
the
permanent
record
of
his
achievement
this
appeared
in
the
caloric
engine
and
still
later
in
the
ericsson
air
engine
of
the
present
day
this
era
was
one
of
development
and
promise
and
richly
were
the
promises
fulfilled
in
the
achievements
of
his
later
years
a
careful
study
of
his
life
to
this
point
is
sufficient
to
show
that
with
health
and
time
such
a
nature
would
certainly
leave
a
mark
wide
and
deep
on
the
world
in
which
it
was
placed
his
characteristics
were
such
that
achievement
was
the
very
essence
of
life
and
with
the
promise
and
potency
as
revealed
in
this
first
years
of
his
life
we
may
be
well
prepared
for
the
brilliant
record
of
the
remaining
with
ericsson
arrival
in
london
began
the
second
important
period
of
his
life
his
first
efforts
were
directed
toward
the
introduction
of
the
but
he
soon
found
unexpected
difficulties
in
the
use
of
coal
as
fuel
instead
of
wood
and
it
became
clear
that
in
order
to
live
he
must
turn
his
attention
to
other
matters
for
a
time
then
followed
a
series
of
remarkable
pieces
of
work
in
which
ericsson
genius
showed
itself
either
in
original
invention
or
in
the
adaptation
and
improvement
of
the
existing
facts
and
material
of
engineering
practice
while
thus
occupied
his
leave
from
his
regiment
expired
and
he
seems
to
have
overlooked
taking
proper
steps
to
have
it
renewed
he
was
thus
placed
technically
in
the
attitude
of
a
deserter
through
the
intervention
of
a
friend
however
he
was
soon
afterward
restored
and
promoted
to
the
rank
of
captain
in
the
swedish
army
this
commission
he
immediately
resigned
and
thus
his
record
became
technically
cleared
of
all
reproach
to
give
a
mere
list
of
the
work
with
which
ericsson
was
occupied
during
the
years
from
to
when
he
removed
to
the
united
states
would
be
no
small
task
and
reference
to
the
more
important
only
can
be
here
made
compressed
air
for
transmitting
power
forced
draft
for
boilers
by
means
of
centrifugal
blowers
steam
boilers
of
new
and
improved
types
the
surface
condenser
for
marine
engines
the
location
of
the
engines
of
a
ship
for
war
purposes
below
the
water
line
the
steam
the
design
and
construction
of
the
novelty
a
locomotive
for
the
rainhill
contest
in
when
stephenson
rocket
was
awarded
the
prize
though
ericsson
heavily
handicapped
in
time
and
by
lack
of
a
track
on
which
to
adjust
and
perfect
the
novelty
achieved
a
result
apparently
in
many
ways
superior
to
stephenson
with
the
rocket
various
designs
for
rotary
engines
an
apparatus
for
making
salt
from
brine
further
experimental
work
with
various
forms
of
heat
or
caloric
engines
and
the
final
development
in
of
a
type
from
which
great
results
were
for
a
time
expected
superheated
steam
and
engines
for
its
use
a
apparatus
embodying
the
same
principle
as
that
later
developed
by
lord
kelvin
in
the
apparatus
of
the
present
day
a
machine
for
cutting
files
automatically
various
types
of
and
finally
his
work
in
connection
with
the
introduction
of
the
as
a
means
of
propulsion
for
steam
vessels
these
are
some
of
the
important
lines
of
work
on
which
ericsson
was
engaged
during
the
twelve
years
of
his
life
in
london
in
connection
with
some
he
was
undoubtedly
a
pioneer
and
deserves
credit
as
an
original
inventor
in
connection
with
others
his
work
was
that
of
improvement
or
adaptation
but
in
all
his
influence
was
profound
and
the
legacy
which
we
have
received
from
this
period
of
engineering
progress
is
due
in
no
small
degree
to
ericsson
and
to
his
work
in
london
during
these
years
at
a
later
point
we
shall
refer
in
some
further
detail
to
these
questions
but
desire
for
the
moment
rather
to
gain
a
broad
and
comprehensive
view
of
his
life
as
a
whole
ericsson
has
been
by
some
called
a
spendthrift
in
invention
and
the
term
is
not
without
some
justice
in
its
application
his
genius
was
uneasy
and
his
mind
was
oppressed
by
the
wealth
of
his
ideas
it
was
this
very
wealth
which
led
him
from
one
idea
to
another
without
always
taking
sufficient
time
in
which
to
develop
and
perfect
his
plans
rich
in
invention
he
cared
but
little
for
exploitation
and
when
the
truth
of
his
predictions
was
demonstrated
or
the
ground
of
his
expectation
justified
he
was
eager
for
new
achievements
and
new
combinations
of
the
materials
of
engineering
progress
in
this
spirit
of
struggle
and
unrest
he
passed
the
years
in
london
rapidly
becoming
known
for
his
versatility
in
invention
and
for
his
daring
and
originality
in
the
details
of
his
engineering
work
from
to
or
during
the
second
half
of
this
term
of
residence
in
london
he
became
in
increasing
measure
absorbed
in
his
work
connected
with
the
as
a
means
of
marine
propulsion
ericsson
name
in
the
popular
mind
has
been
most
commonly
associated
with
the
monitor
and
her
fight
with
the
merrimac
in
the
civil
war
and
next
probably
with
the
as
a
means
of
marine
propulsion
it
will
therefore
be
proper
at
the
present
point
to
refer
in
some
further
detail
to
the
circumstances
connected
with
his
relation
to
the
introduction
of
the
regarding
this
question
an
entire
volume
might
be
written
without
doing
more
than
justice
to
the
subject
but
only
a
brief
statement
of
the
chief
facts
can
be
here
attempted
as
early
as
the
seventeenth
century
the
possibility
of
developing
a
propulsive
thrust
by
the
use
of
a
submerged
helicoidal
or
screw
propeller
had
been
vaguely
recognized
and
during
the
following
or
eighteenth
century
the
same
idea
had
been
brought
forward
it
had
been
viewed
in
this
connection
however
merely
as
a
curiosity
and
led
to
no
immediate
results
later
in
francis
stevens
of
new
jersey
in
an
experimental
boat
on
the
hudson
operated
twin
screws
and
demonstrated
their
applicability
to
the
requirements
of
marine
practice
these
propellers
in
fact
had
a
form
far
more
nearly
approaching
the
modern
than
did
those
which
came
somewhat
later
and
which
marked
the
real
entry
of
the
into
actual
and
practical
service
again
in
ressel
a
student
in
the
university
of
vienna
began
to
study
the
and
his
first
drawing
dates
from
this
time
in
he
carried
on
experiments
in
a
barge
driven
by
hand
and
in
an
austrian
patent
was
granted
him
two
years
later
he
applied
his
screw
to
a
boat
with
an
engine
of
six
and
a
speed
of
six
miles
per
hour
was
said
to
have
been
attained
then
came
a
bursting
and
the
police
put
a
stop
to
the
experiments
which
seem
to
have
had
no
further
results
likewise
in
captain
delisle
of
the
french
engineers
presented
a
memorial
to
his
government
in
which
he
urged
the
use
of
the
submerged
propeller
for
the
propulsion
of
steam
vessels
no
especial
attention
was
given
to
the
suggestion
however
and
it
was
apparently
forgotten
until
later
when
the
propeller
had
become
a
demonstrated
success
then
this
memorial
was
remembered
and
its
author
brought
forward
to
receive
his
share
of
credit
in
connection
with
the
adaptation
of
the
propeller
to
marine
propulsion
these
various
attempts
to
introduce
the
seem
curiously
enough
to
have
had
no
lasting
result
they
were
not
followed
up
and
in
the
mean
time
had
to
some
extent
passed
out
of
memory
or
if
remembered
the
absence
of
result
can
hardly
have
acted
as
an
incentive
to
fresh
effort
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
as
a
possibility
for
marine
propulsion
was
known
in
a
vague
way
to
the
engineering
practice
of
the
day
and
it
is
at
this
time
of
course
quite
impossible
to
say
how
much
may
have
been
known
by
ericsson
smith
or
others
concerned
in
later
developments
or
to
what
extent
they
may
have
been
dependent
for
suggestion
on
what
had
preceded
them
the
question
of
who
invented
the
in
the
absolute
sense
is
entirely
futile
and
without
answer
no
one
could
ever
have
reasonably
advanced
any
such
unique
claim
at
the
best
it
is
simply
a
question
of
the
relative
influence
in
the
introduction
improvement
and
practical
application
of
what
was
the
common
property
of
the
engineering
practice
of
the
day
in
or
at
the
period
now
under
consideration
however
the
was
the
recognized
instrument
of
marine
propulsion
since
the
beginning
of
the
century
it
had
been
growing
in
use
with
the
gradual
growth
in
the
application
of
steam
and
at
this
time
it
held
the
field
alone
some
years
earlier
it
appears
that
some
of
the
objections
to
the
had
become
plainly
apparent
to
ericsson
although
occupied
with
other
matters
as
he
was
there
was
no
immediate
result
he
apparently
recognized
that
the
slow
revolutions
possible
with
the
did
not
favor
the
improvement
of
the
along
the
lines
which
have
since
been
followed
and
he
saw
clearly
that
for
warship
purposes
the
engines
employed
exposed
above
the
to
destruction
from
the
shell
of
an
enemy
were
entirely
out
of
the
question
finally
in
and
we
find
him
employed
by
a
carrying
company
in
london
to
conduct
numerous
trials
with
submerged
propellers
in
the
london
and
birmingham
canal
in
an
affidavit
made
in
march
he
states
that
in
his
attention
was
particularly
called
to
the
subject
of
oblique
propulsion
and
that
under
his
direction
propellers
of
various
patterns
and
embodying
these
principles
were
fitted
on
a
named
the
francis
and
later
in
to
another
called
the
annatorius
shortly
after
this
or
in
his
ideas
took
more
definite
form
and
he
refers
to
his
work
in
a
letter
to
his
friend
john
bourne
in
the
following
terms
designed
a
rotary
propeller
to
be
actuated
by
consisting
of
a
series
of
segments
of
a
screw
attached
to
a
thin
broad
hoop
supported
by
arms
so
twisted
as
also
to
form
part
of
a
screw
the
propeller
subsequently
applied
to
the
steamship
was
identical
with
my
said
design
of
even
the
mode
adopted
to
determine
by
geometrical
construction
the
twist
of
the
blades
and
arms
of
the
and
other
propellers
was
identical
with
my
design
of
the
year
last
mentioned
at
about
this
same
time
or
in
the
attention
of
smith
seems
to
have
been
drawn
to
the
subject
of
the
and
we
find
him
taking
out
a
patent
for
his
form
consisting
of
an
elongated
helix
or
spiral
of
several
turns
under
date
of
may
patent
followed
some
six
weeks
later
or
on
july
while
it
thus
appears
that
ericsson
had
been
studying
the
problem
since
or
earlier
according
to
his
own
statements
there
is
no
evidence
that
smith
attention
was
drawn
to
the
matter
earlier
than
delay
on
ericsson
part
in
the
matter
of
patent
gives
the
earlier
date
to
smith
the
mere
date
of
a
patent
however
is
of
small
moment
for
our
present
purposes
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
modern
form
of
is
quite
unlike
either
of
these
original
forms
although
they
all
involve
of
course
the
same
fundamental
principles
ericsson
propeller
may
properly
be
called
an
engineering
success
built
on
sound
principles
but
improved
and
largely
modified
by
the
results
of
later
experience
and
research
smith
propeller
while
capable
of
propelling
a
boat
was
the
design
of
an
amateur
rather
than
of
an
engineer
and
in
comparison
with
ericsson
seemed
to
show
a
somewhat
less
accurate
appreciation
of
the
underlying
principles
upon
which
the
propeller
operates
in
the
present
case
as
we
have
noted
above
the
question
is
not
so
much
one
of
invention
as
of
influence
in
introduction
adaptation
and
improvement
the
was
already
known
but
had
not
been
introduced
into
and
made
a
part
of
actual
engineering
practice
services
in
this
direction
are
all
that
can
be
claimed
for
any
of
those
concerned
with
the
question
during
the
third
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
from
this
point
of
view
we
must
give
to
ericsson
large
credit
he
had
the
courage
of
his
convictions
and
did
not
allow
his
work
in
this
direction
to
lapse
for
lack
of
effort
on
his
part
to
secure
its
introduction
into
the
practice
of
the
day
thus
in
the
francis
ogden
was
built
for
the
special
purpose
of
testing
the
power
of
the
and
was
operated
on
the
thames
for
the
benefit
of
the
british
admiralty
and
many
others
shortly
after
this
and
largely
through
the
influence
of
capt
robert
stockton
of
the
american
navy
and
francis
ogden
the
american
consul
at
liverpool
ericsson
began
to
consider
a
visit
to
the
united
states
for
the
purpose
of
building
under
stockton
auspices
a
vessel
for
the
united
states
navy
while
these
negotiations
were
under
way
in
he
built
for
captain
stockton
a
named
the
robert
stockton
the
trials
of
which
attracted
much
attention
from
the
public
at
large
and
from
engineers
of
the
time
at
about
the
same
period
ericsson
propeller
was
fitted
to
a
called
the
novelty
plying
between
manchester
and
london
this
was
presumably
the
first
instance
of
a
employed
on
a
vessel
actually
used
for
commercial
purposes
finally
in
pursuance
of
ericsson
plans
with
captain
stockton
he
left
england
and
started
for
new
york
in
the
steamer
great
western
where
he
arrived
november
after
a
long
and
stormy
passage
we
now
reach
the
final
scene
of
ericsson
life
and
professional
activities
his
visit
was
at
first
intended
only
as
temporary
and
he
seems
to
have
anticipated
an
early
return
after
carrying
out
his
plans
with
reference
to
a
ship
for
the
united
states
navy
to
quote
from
a
letter
to
his
friend
john
sargent
he
says
i
visited
this
country
at
ogden
most
earnest
solicitations
to
introduce
my
propeller
on
the
canals
and
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
i
had
at
the
same
time
strong
reasons
for
supposing
that
stockton
would
be
able
to
start
the
frigate
for
which
i
had
prepared
such
laborious
plans
in
england
the
event
was
otherwise
determined
however
and
during
the
remaining
fifty
years
of
his
life
he
lived
and
wrought
in
the
new
world
and
as
a
citizen
of
his
adopted
country
if
the
record
of
his
twelve
years
of
work
in
london
was
long
that
for
the
remaining
and
maturer
years
of
his
life
may
well
be
imagined
as
vastly
greater
during
the
earlier
part
of
this
period
or
until
the
civil
war
when
all
his
energies
were
concentrated
upon
his
work
in
connection
with
the
monitor
type
of
warship
we
find
the
same
wealth
of
invention
and
human
energy
but
for
the
most
part
directed
along
lines
related
to
marine
and
naval
construction
it
was
a
period
of
training
for
the
fuller
fruitage
of
his
genius
during
the
civil
war
shortly
after
his
arrival
or
in
a
prize
was
offered
by
the
mechanics
institute
of
new
york
for
the
best
plan
of
a
steam
with
his
previous
experience
in
london
ericsson
easily
carried
off
the
palm
and
was
awarded
the
prize
he
further
occupied
himself
with
the
introduction
of
propellers
on
boats
engaged
in
the
inland
navigation
of
the
united
states
with
the
design
and
construction
of
the
united
states
steam
frigate
princeton
with
the
development
of
the
compound
principle
in
the
then
in
with
his
ship
ericsson
or
ship
propelled
by
or
caloric
engines
as
they
were
then
termed
and
later
with
caloric
engines
in
smaller
sizes
for
stationary
purposes
of
which
several
thousand
were
sold
during
the
next
succeeding
years
in
the
work
of
introducing
his
propellers
good
progress
was
made
especially
in
boats
built
for
use
on
the
great
lakes
so
that
by
when
the
princeton
went
into
commission
there
were
in
use
some
vessels
with
the
as
a
means
of
propulsion
the
project
of
building
a
vessel
for
the
american
navy
the
purpose
which
had
most
strongly
attracted
ericsson
to
the
united
states
suffered
long
delay
in
connection
with
the
arrangements
between
captain
stockton
and
the
naval
authorities
at
washington
at
length
in
captain
stockton
was
authorized
to
proceed
with
the
construction
of
a
screw
steam
frigate
of
about
one
thousand
tons
this
was
the
princeton
which
marks
an
epoch
as
the
first
screw
she
was
followed
by
the
french
pomone
in
and
the
english
amphion
in
for
the
equipment
of
which
ericsson
agent
in
england
count
von
rosen
received
commissions
from
the
french
and
english
governments
respectively
the
princeton
was
completed
in
due
time
and
was
equipped
with
two
guns
one
brought
by
ericsson
from
england
and
one
designed
and
built
under
the
direction
of
captain
stockton
at
the
trials
of
the
ship
in
the
latter
gun
exploded
killing
the
secretaries
of
state
and
of
the
navy
besides
other
prominent
visitors
on
board
and
wounding
several
others
this
terrible
disaster
threw
an
entirely
undeserved
stigma
upon
the
ship
herself
and
upon
work
and
it
was
not
until
many
years
after
that
his
name
was
entirely
free
from
some
kind
of
reproach
in
connection
with
the
princeton
and
the
deplorable
results
of
the
accident
on
board
these
are
some
of
the
principal
lines
of
work
with
which
ericsson
occupied
himself
during
the
years
between
and
at
the
latter
date
came
the
supreme
opportunity
of
his
life
and
his
services
in
the
art
of
naval
construction
during
the
remainder
of
the
civil
war
which
was
then
in
progress
are
a
part
of
the
history
of
that
great
struggle
here
as
with
the
propeller
volumes
might
be
written
in
the
attempt
to
give
a
full
account
of
the
inception
growth
and
final
vindication
of
ericsson
ideas
regarding
naval
offence
and
defence
as
expressed
by
the
means
available
in
the
engineering
practice
of
the
day
the
leading
points
only
can
be
summarized
the
question
of
armored
ships
was
in
the
air
the
advantages
of
armor
had
been
already
demonstrated
on
the
french
ship
gloire
and
others
in
connection
with
the
naval
part
of
the
crimean
war
and
there
was
a
feeling
that
ironclads
of
some
kind
were
a
necessity
of
the
situation
these
facts
were
perhaps
more
clearly
realized
at
the
south
than
at
the
north
and
early
in
we
find
stephen
mallory
the
confederate
secretary
of
the
navy
taking
active
steps
to
raise
the
merrimac
which
had
been
sunken
at
the
norfolk
navy
yard
and
convert
her
into
an
information
regarding
this
project
naturally
became
known
to
the
federal
authorities
and
occasioned
president
lincoln
and
the
entire
cabinet
the
most
serious
anxiety
at
length
on
august
the
appointment
of
a
board
was
authorized
the
duty
of
which
it
should
be
to
examine
into
the
question
fully
obtain
plans
and
recommend
the
construction
of
such
as
they
should
judge
best
suited
to
the
demands
of
the
situation
shortly
after
this
ericsson
forwarded
to
president
lincoln
a
communication
in
which
he
offered
to
construct
a
vessel
for
the
destruction
of
the
rebel
fleet
at
norfolk
and
for
scouring
the
southern
rivers
and
inlets
of
all
craft
protected
by
rebel
batteries
for
one
reason
or
another
this
communication
does
not
seem
to
have
produced
any
immediate
result
later
however
when
the
board
made
its
report
dated
september
they
registered
the
opinion
that
the
present
demand
called
for
vessels
invulnerable
to
shot
of
light
draft
of
water
before
going
into
a
more
perfect
system
of
large
seagoing
vessels
of
war
in
pursuance
of
this
idea
they
recommended
the
construction
of
three
vessels
ericsson
floating
battery
a
broadside
vessel
later
known
as
the
ironsides
and
the
galena
bushnell
who
was
instrumental
in
bringing
ericsson
plans
actually
before
the
board
later
associated
with
himself
and
ericsson
in
the
project
two
gentlemen
of
means
and
large
manufacturers
of
iron
plate
john
griswold
and
john
winslow
who
advanced
most
of
the
money
needed
bushnell
supplying
the
remainder
the
keel
was
laid
and
the
monitor
as
she
was
named
by
ericsson
was
launched
and
was
turned
over
to
the
government
this
brief
record
of
construction
leaves
untold
all
history
of
the
ceaseless
struggle
against
time
and
of
the
superb
organization
and
distribution
of
the
work
which
made
possible
the
completion
of
such
a
piece
of
work
in
the
period
of
one
hundred
working
days
one
important
fact
which
goes
far
to
explain
this
astonishing
speed
in
design
and
construction
is
found
in
the
fact
that
ericsson
was
not
dealing
with
an
entirely
new
and
freshly
developed
proposition
he
has
stated
that
the
thought
of
a
floating
battery
which
should
be
small
in
size
but
impregnable
to
the
heaviest
guns
known
and
yet
heavily
armed
herself
had
long
occupied
his
thoughts
in
connection
with
the
problem
of
the
defence
of
sweden
ericsson
never
forgot
his
native
land
and
gave
to
her
political
troubles
and
to
the
question
of
her
defence
against
her
more
powerful
neighbors
much
serious
thought
as
a
result
of
this
study
he
had
produced
as
early
as
a
design
embodying
all
the
essential
features
of
the
monitor
and
this
design
shown
by
a
model
was
in
that
year
sent
to
napoleon
who
was
then
at
war
with
russia
this
was
in
the
hope
that
he
might
in
this
way
contribute
to
the
overthrow
of
the
latter
the
hereditary
enemy
of
his
native
land
the
design
however
was
not
adopted
and
after
it
was
returned
was
laid
aside
to
collect
the
dust
of
his
office
until
the
experiences
of
the
civil
war
brought
it
again
to
the
light
the
plan
in
all
its
main
features
had
therefore
long
been
matured
and
it
only
remained
to
proceed
rapidly
with
the
details
and
with
the
realization
of
the
idea
in
the
most
suitable
materials
to
be
obtained
the
result
of
the
battle
between
the
monitor
and
the
merrimac
in
hampton
roads
is
a
part
of
history
the
relentless
devastation
which
the
latter
had
begun
on
the
old
wooden
ships
of
the
american
navy
at
hampton
roads
was
stayed
and
the
wild
fears
at
the
north
concerning
the
destruction
which
she
might
cause
to
the
shipping
and
to
the
seaboard
cities
was
calmed
the
merrimac
met
her
master
and
retired
from
the
conflict
crippled
and
shorn
of
power
for
further
evil
a
short
time
later
she
sank
beneath
the
waters
of
the
chesapeake
and
is
now
remembered
only
as
the
antagonist
of
the
monitor
if
the
result
of
this
battle
between
the
monitor
and
the
merrimac
marked
a
in
the
naval
aspect
of
the
civil
war
it
wrought
a
no
less
marked
change
in
the
standing
and
fortunes
of
her
designer
some
of
his
engineering
efforts
had
not
met
with
the
success
for
which
he
or
his
friends
had
hoped
the
engines
of
the
while
a
success
as
a
piece
of
mechanism
were
so
enormous
and
heavy
that
she
had
to
be
considered
as
a
commercial
failure
and
the
venture
was
not
repeated
the
deplorable
accident
on
the
princeton
was
by
some
held
to
be
in
part
chargeable
to
ericsson
though
a
later
and
full
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
shows
that
such
was
in
no
wise
the
case
again
ericsson
as
an
experimenter
and
pioneer
was
by
some
considered
as
a
dreamer
and
before
the
monitor
was
completed
there
was
no
lack
of
croakers
who
prophesied
failure
or
who
openly
ridiculed
the
idea
this
condition
was
of
course
natural
in
many
ways
ericsson
was
ahead
of
his
age
and
again
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
he
avoided
mistakes
or
that
all
of
his
work
fully
realized
the
expectations
which
were
based
upon
it
furthermore
ericsson
spirit
was
proud
and
he
was
little
disposed
to
accept
criticism
from
those
whom
he
felt
to
be
unqualified
to
pass
adequate
judgment
on
his
work
while
he
was
especially
impatient
under
the
system
by
which
government
work
was
done
he
was
therefore
but
little
disposed
to
pleasantly
submit
to
the
exasperating
delays
and
interferences
with
his
work
which
arose
from
the
methods
of
doing
public
business
and
it
is
no
more
than
the
simple
truth
to
say
that
during
the
preceding
years
the
relations
between
ericsson
and
the
officials
of
the
navy
department
had
often
become
seriously
strained
and
they
were
seldom
in
cordial
accord
regarding
the
various
questions
which
arose
in
connection
with
his
public
work
with
the
demonstration
made
by
the
monitor
however
the
attitude
of
the
public
changed
in
a
moment
and
ericsson
was
hailed
on
every
hand
as
a
public
benefactor
he
received
the
thanks
of
congress
on
march
and
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
a
little
later
besides
these
he
was
the
recipient
of
numbers
of
memorials
and
mementoes
and
of
such
praise
in
every
form
as
might
well
have
disturbed
the
equilibrium
of
a
mind
less
well
balanced
in
all
this
change
of
public
opinion
the
one
thing
which
must
have
given
him
the
deepest
satisfaction
was
the
change
in
the
attitude
of
the
naval
authorities
at
washington
he
was
now
considered
as
one
whose
ideas
had
demonstrated
their
right
to
serious
and
respectful
attention
and
a
large
fleet
of
vessels
of
the
monitor
type
was
ordered
similar
to
but
larger
than
the
prototype
and
containing
such
minor
changes
as
experience
had
suggested
yet
even
this
was
not
accomplished
without
objection
the
officers
of
the
navy
were
accustomed
to
the
old
type
of
wooden
ship
and
were
slow
to
realize
that
naval
war
was
after
all
an
engineering
problem
and
that
the
ideas
of
the
engineer
must
now
be
substituted
for
those
which
had
been
sanctified
by
long
ages
of
past
experience
still
the
demonstration
was
too
convincing
to
admit
of
serious
question
and
ericsson
and
his
associates
in
business
were
busily
occupied
during
the
remainder
of
the
war
in
the
design
and
construction
of
a
numerous
fleet
of
vessels
of
the
monitor
type
ericsson
work
during
this
period
was
enormous
one
design
followed
another
in
quick
succession
while
work
of
supervision
and
inspection
and
cares
of
a
business
nature
all
combined
to
make
a
burden
which
would
have
broken
down
a
nature
less
determined
and
and
a
body
less
inured
to
physical
endurance
and
sustained
nervous
tension
this
prodigious
load
was
not
so
much
but
that
he
found
time
to
devote
to
the
needs
of
other
nations
and
in
he
offered
to
construct
for
the
chilian
government
a
monitor
similar
to
those
under
construction
for
the
united
states
while
later
a
similar
offer
was
made
to
the
peruvian
government
with
the
close
of
the
civil
war
ericsson
found
still
further
time
to
devote
to
the
introduction
of
this
type
of
vessel
into
foreign
navies
and
a
considerable
part
of
his
time
seems
to
have
been
occupied
with
projects
of
this
character
and
more
particularly
with
the
question
of
the
naval
defence
of
his
native
land
as
regards
the
introduction
of
warships
of
the
monitor
type
the
results
were
not
so
pronounced
as
might
have
been
expected
and
while
the
influence
of
the
idea
is
seen
in
the
practice
of
every
maritime
nation
in
regard
to
the
construction
of
its
warships
still
for
the
most
part
the
leading
nations
preferred
to
make
application
of
the
idea
in
their
own
way
rather
than
order
such
vessels
direct
from
their
original
designer
yet
in
not
a
few
cases
the
original
type
was
faithfully
copied
though
it
is
not
always
clear
to
what
extent
ericsson
himself
may
have
had
direct
contact
with
their
designs
in
the
swedes
were
able
to
test
the
first
of
a
small
fleet
of
monitors
built
after
ericsson
plans
this
was
called
the
john
ericsson
and
was
armed
with
two
guns
presented
to
sweden
by
ericsson
himself
later
in
he
designed
for
spain
and
superintended
the
construction
of
thirty
small
gunboats
for
use
in
cuban
waters
for
nearly
ten
years
now
ericsson
had
devoted
most
of
his
energies
to
the
art
of
war
it
was
a
time
of
change
and
unrest
heavy
guns
and
armor
had
brought
about
a
complete
break
with
the
past
the
torpedo
which
had
made
its
appearance
in
crude
form
during
the
civil
war
was
attracting
more
and
more
attention
and
questions
of
naval
offence
and
defence
and
of
the
best
governmental
policy
were
attracting
the
serious
attention
of
all
whose
duty
led
them
into
relation
with
such
matters
into
this
problem
in
its
broadest
aspects
ericsson
threw
himself
in
the
early
with
all
the
ardor
of
his
younger
days
it
is
proper
to
explain
here
that
there
was
one
feature
of
the
earlier
plans
which
were
submitted
to
napoleon
iii
in
which
he
did
not
embody
in
the
monitor
and
which
indeed
was
omitted
from
all
published
plans
and
descriptions
of
the
system
given
out
in
former
years
this
was
a
system
of
submarine
or
subaqueous
attack
which
he
states
in
a
letter
to
john
bourne
had
attracted
his
attention
since
the
time
now
seemed
ripe
for
the
presentation
and
development
of
this
idea
and
he
accordingly
developed
his
designs
for
a
torpedo
and
for
a
method
of
firing
it
under
water
from
a
gun
carried
in
the
bow
of
a
boat
and
suitably
opening
to
allow
the
discharge
of
the
torpedo
projectile
this
was
ericsson
destroyer
system
and
was
embodied
finally
in
a
boat
called
the
destroyer
which
he
built
in
company
with
his
friend
delamater
and
with
which
he
carried
on
numerous
experiments
in
the
end
however
the
system
did
not
commend
itself
to
the
naval
authorities
and
the
destroyer
was
left
on
her
designer
hands
an
instance
of
difference
of
opinion
between
ericsson
and
those
charged
with
the
duty
of
naval
administration
and
with
no
supreme
test
of
war
to
provide
opportunity
for
the
determination
as
to
which
were
the
more
correct
in
their
judgment
with
the
destroyer
and
his
work
in
connection
with
her
closes
the
record
of
connection
with
the
advance
in
naval
construction
during
these
later
years
of
his
life
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
he
was
less
busily
occupied
than
in
earlier
life
his
was
a
nature
which
knew
no
rest
and
to
the
last
day
of
his
life
he
was
literally
in
the
harness
only
brief
mention
however
can
be
made
of
some
of
the
more
important
lines
of
work
which
interested
the
closing
years
of
ericsson
life
in
connection
with
his
naval
designs
he
devoted
much
study
to
the
improvement
of
heavy
ordnance
both
as
to
the
gun
and
its
mounting
in
particular
his
mounting
of
the
guns
in
the
monitor
was
quite
original
and
the
friction
arrangement
for
absorbing
the
recoil
was
a
great
improvement
over
methods
then
in
use
and
served
as
a
model
for
many
copies
and
adaptations
of
the
same
principles
in
later
years
by
other
designers
in
he
also
designed
and
built
for
the
acceptance
of
the
government
a
forged
gun
while
his
design
was
an
advance
on
those
of
the
day
the
demands
on
the
makers
of
iron
forgings
were
more
than
could
be
successfully
met
and
the
gun
developed
some
slight
cracks
in
the
test
which
prevented
further
developments
on
this
line
ericsson
always
maintained
that
the
tests
to
which
this
gun
was
submitted
were
unfairly
severe
and
he
showed
how
the
defects
could
be
remedied
by
a
steel
lining
but
the
naval
bureau
of
ordnance
insisted
that
this
should
be
done
at
his
own
expense
and
as
he
had
already
lost
some
on
the
gun
he
was
unwilling
to
proceed
farther
and
the
matter
was
allowed
to
lapse
throughout
his
entire
career
the
improvement
of
the
occupied
a
large
share
of
ericsson
attention
and
in
particular
was
this
the
case
in
connection
with
his
naval
designs
from
the
princeton
in
to
the
destroyer
in
there
succeeded
one
long
series
of
types
and
forms
of
each
in
his
opinion
the
best
adapted
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case
naturally
opinions
differ
and
he
was
brought
into
competition
with
other
able
engineers
and
his
designs
were
often
called
into
question
or
subjected
to
criticism
in
in
competition
with
chief
engineer
isherwood
of
the
navy
engines
were
designed
for
twin
ships
the
madawaska
afterward
known
as
the
tennessee
and
the
wampanoag
afterward
called
the
florida
this
was
a
battle
royal
of
types
and
modes
of
application
of
the
power
of
the
to
the
propulsion
of
ships
the
result
was
a
victory
for
isherwood
although
the
madawaska
which
was
first
subjected
to
trial
made
a
speed
higher
than
any
warship
at
that
time
afloat
this
was
exceeded
by
the
wampanoag
a
short
time
later
but
neither
engine
was
of
an
enduring
type
and
after
a
time
the
machinery
of
the
madawaska
was
removed
and
she
was
repowered
with
a
later
type
of
machinery
and
long
did
service
as
the
tennessee
in
the
list
of
wooden
frigates
of
the
navy
the
florida
was
too
expensive
to
maintain
in
commission
and
the
special
circumstances
which
had
called
her
into
existence
having
passed
by
she
was
laid
up
at
new
london
and
never
again
saw
active
service
keenly
as
ericsson
was
interested
in
the
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
always
showed
a
more
profound
interest
in
some
form
of
engine
which
should
be
able
to
displace
it
with
a
superior
efficiency
and
hence
his
long
series
of
efforts
relating
to
the
the
caloric
engine
the
and
finally
the
solar
engine
with
either
steam
or
heated
air
as
the
medium
for
carrying
the
heat
during
the
last
years
of
his
life
some
of
his
most
patient
and
careful
study
was
given
to
the
perfection
of
a
solar
engine
or
engine
for
utilizing
directly
the
heat
of
the
sun
instead
of
that
of
coal
or
other
carbon
compounds
besides
this
direct
line
of
study
and
experimentation
he
gave
during
these
years
much
thought
to
various
scientific
problems
connected
with
solar
energy
the
tides
gravitation
the
nature
of
heat
etc
a
plan
for
deriving
power
direct
from
the
tides
improvements
in
engines
for
purposes
further
improvements
in
his
engine
in
small
sizes
for
commercial
purposes
these
are
some
of
the
further
lines
of
work
which
occupied
the
attention
of
his
closing
years
but
the
most
cunningly
devised
of
all
mechanisms
the
heart
and
brain
must
sooner
or
later
tire
and
cease
from
their
labors
the
motive
energy
becomes
exhausted
and
the
mechanism
must
cease
its
work
so
it
was
with
john
ericsson
in
the
first
hour
of
the
morning
of
march
ericsson
died
this
was
within
one
day
of
the
anniversary
of
the
battle
at
hampton
roads
the
event
with
which
the
name
of
ericsson
will
always
be
associated
and
which
has
given
to
it
a
significance
that
will
never
be
forgotten
his
remains
were
first
interred
in
new
york
and
then
in
in
accordance
with
the
request
of
the
swedish
government
they
were
returned
with
impressive
services
to
his
native
land
where
they
now
rest
in
his
death
he
received
his
highest
honors
for
his
remains
were
conveyed
across
the
atlantic
by
the
baltimore
one
of
the
new
ships
of
the
navy
specially
detailed
for
that
service
and
on
both
sides
in
the
united
states
and
in
sweden
the
event
was
marked
with
every
honor
and
ceremony
which
could
indicate
the
significance
of
his
life
and
services
for
his
adopted
land
and
for
the
world
at
large
the
two
pieces
of
work
which
perhaps
will
be
most
permanently
linked
with
the
name
of
ericsson
are
the
as
a
means
of
marine
propulsion
and
the
monitor
as
a
type
of
warship
in
addition
to
these
however
his
was
rich
in
results
which
bore
direct
relation
to
many
other
improvements
in
the
broad
field
of
marine
engineering
and
naval
architecture
of
these
a
few
of
the
more
important
may
be
mentioned
such
as
the
surface
condenser
distiller
and
evaporator
forced
draft
for
combustion
placing
machinery
of
warships
below
the
and
their
protection
by
coal
ventilation
by
together
with
a
vast
variety
of
items
involved
in
the
conception
and
design
of
the
monitor
as
a
whole
and
in
his
other
naval
designs
in
order
to
appreciate
the
influence
of
ericsson
life
and
work
on
the
field
of
marine
construction
a
brief
glance
may
profitably
be
taken
at
this
branch
of
engineering
work
as
it
was
before
ericsson
time
and
as
it
is
now
the
material
employed
for
shipbuilding
was
almost
entirely
wood
this
was
displaced
in
the
and
by
iron
which
in
turn
was
displaced
by
steel
so
that
at
the
present
time
except
for
special
reason
no
material
other
than
steel
is
thought
of
for
this
purpose
with
the
gradual
displacement
of
wood
by
iron
in
the
mercantile
marine
ericsson
relation
was
only
indirect
some
of
the
earlier
mercantile
vessels
in
which
he
was
interested
were
of
wood
and
some
of
iron
in
the
field
of
warship
construction
however
his
influence
through
the
monitor
was
more
direct
especially
as
to
the
value
of
metal
armor
as
a
protection
against
great
still
it
is
no
more
than
justice
to
say
that
with
the
change
from
wood
to
iron
which
took
place
during
the
active
part
of
his
life
ericsson
had
only
an
indirect
relation
and
the
change
would
doubtless
have
come
about
at
the
same
time
and
in
much
the
same
general
way
as
it
did
independent
of
any
influence
which
his
work
may
have
had
upon
the
question
turning
to
the
means
of
propulsion
we
find
sails
as
the
main
or
almost
only
reliance
during
the
early
years
of
the
century
the
operating
had
come
to
be
recognized
as
a
possibility
and
under
certain
conditions
as
a
commercial
success
the
as
a
means
of
propulsion
was
known
only
as
a
freak
idea
and
was
without
status
or
recognition
as
a
commercial
or
practical
means
for
propelling
ships
so
far
as
the
was
thought
of
as
a
means
of
propulsion
it
lay
under
a
suspicion
of
loss
of
efficiency
due
to
the
oblique
nature
of
its
action
and
this
was
supposed
to
be
such
as
to
render
it
necessarily
and
essentially
less
efficient
than
the
ericsson
lived
to
see
the
use
of
sails
almost
entirely
discarded
for
war
purposes
and
for
mercantile
purposes
relegated
to
ships
for
special
service
and
of
continually
decreasing
importance
he
lived
to
see
the
take
its
place
as
the
only
means
for
supplying
the
power
required
to
propel
warships
and
attain
a
position
of
almost
equal
relative
importance
in
the
mercantile
marine
he
lived
to
see
the
grow
in
importance
and
estimation
as
a
means
of
propulsion
only
in
turn
to
be
supplanted
by
the
which
gradually
increased
in
engineering
favor
from
the
days
of
its
obscure
infancy
until
it
became
the
only
means
employed
for
the
propulsion
of
ships
navigating
the
high
seas
while
it
had
become
a
most
serious
rival
to
the
even
for
the
purposes
of
interior
and
navigation
long
a
field
considered
as
peculiarly
suited
to
the
and
to
the
engines
adapted
to
its
operation
regarding
the
change
from
wind
to
steam
for
the
of
ships
ericsson
did
his
full
share
among
the
engineers
of
his
day
but
it
would
be
unfair
to
many
others
to
claim
for
him
any
exclusive
or
preponderating
influence
in
this
movement
and
in
such
matters
it
is
difficult
to
clearly
define
the
services
of
any
one
man
the
lines
of
progress
however
have
been
in
accord
with
his
studies
and
his
work
has
certainly
had
a
most
direct
and
powerful
influence
upon
the
movement
the
most
important
points
of
contact
between
ericsson
work
and
these
advances
were
in
connection
with
his
introduction
of
the
surface
condenser
the
use
of
artificial
draft
devices
for
heating
feed
water
his
studies
in

its
use
and
his
work
in

with
the
development
of
the
compound
principle
in
his
relation
to
the
introduction
of
the
and
to
the
use
of
twin
screws
at
a
later
time
he
also
devised
and
adapted
many
new
types
of
engines
for
marine
purposes
having
respect
to
the
geometrical
character
of
the
connections
by

of
which
a
reciprocating
motion
of
the
piston
may
be
transformed
into
a
rotary
motion
of
the

in
particular
he
was
the
first
to
introduce
and
show
the
advantages
of
engines
directly
connected
to
the
instead
of
through
the
more
indirect
and
clumsy
modes
which
others
had
previously
thought
necessary
aside
from
his
relation
to
the
perhaps
no
item
of
his
work
in
connection
with
the
is
of
more
importance
than
the
surface
condenser
with
its
variant
forms
in
the
distiller
and
evaporator
if
ericsson
had
done
nothing
else
his
claims
to
recognition
and
remembrance
as
an
engineer
and
benefactor
might
have
been
well
founded
on
his
work
in
this
connection
as
it
is
the
fact
that
he
was
so
largely
instrumental
in
their
perfection
and
adaptation
to
marine
uses
is
wellnigh
forgotten
in
the
brighter
light
of
his
other
achievements
regarding
ericsson
relation
to
the
successful
introduction
of
the
little
need
be
added
to
what
has
already
been
said
whatever
may
be
urged
regarding
dates
and
patents
or
earlier
years
in
which
the
was
used
it
is
a
fact
that
in
it
was
not
recognized
as
an
accepted
mode
of
propulsion
while
known
as
a
possibility
it
had
no
standing
in
the
engineering
practice
of
the
day
a
few
years
later
it
was
recognized
as
an
accepted
mode
of
propulsion
and
had
gained
a
permanent
and
definite
place
in
the
practice
of
the
day
a
place
which
has
continued
to
grow
in
importance
until
its
earlier
rival
the
is
almost
on
the
brink
of
relegation
to
museums
of
antiquities
except
possibly
for
rare
and
special
uses
a
careful
and
dispassionate
study
of
the
facts
so
far
as
they
can
be
known
at
the
present
time
seems
to
indicate
clearly
that
of
those
who
were
concerned
in
successfully
adapting
the
to
the
needs
of
marine
propulsion
and
in
laying
the
foundation
for
these
changed
conditions
especially
in
the
united
states
none
was
so
prominent
as
ericsson
or
so
fairly
deserving
of
the
chief
credit
and
with
this
judgment
the
mature
thought
of
the
present
day
seems
to
agree
with
little
dissent
turning
to
a
consideration
from
a
similar
point
of
view
of
services
in
connection
with
warship
design
and
construction
note
may
be
first
taken
of
the
condition
of
the
art
of
naval
warfare
in
the
years
or
when
ericsson
first
began
his
labors
in
this
field
the
material
used
was
wood
the
means
of
propulsion
sails
with
some
thought
of
and
the
means
of
offence
were
guns
large
in
number
but
small
in
size
the
largest
being
or
inches
in
diameter
and
throwing
a
shell
of
some
or
pounds
weight
while
the
means
of
defence
consisted
solely
in
the
wooden
walls
and
modern
ideas
regarding
armor
had
not
even
appeared
above
the
horizon
ericsson
contributions
to
the
art
of
naval
warfare
are
embodied
in
the
princeton
the
monitor
and
its
class
and
the
destroyer
in
the
princeton
the
material
used
was
wood
and
in
the
monitor
and
destroyer
iron
following
simply
the
developments
of
the
age
in
the
three
the
means
of
propulsion
was
by
in
the
princeton
the
means
of
offence
were
two
guns
as
already
noted
in
the
monitor
and
its
type
the
means
of
offence
were
two
guns
followed
later
by
larger
guns
of
and
inches
of
similar
type
in
the
monitors
four
such
guns
were
of
course
installed
in
the
destroyer
the
means
of
offence
was
a
single
gun
for
discharging
a
torpedo
under
water
at
the
bow
on
the
princeton
the
means
of
defence
consisted
still
in
wooden
walls
while
in
the
monitor
and
its
class
the
change
was
profound
and
complete
the
essential
idea
of
the
monitor
was
low
freeboard
and
thus
small
exposed
surface
to
the
ship
herself
combined
with
the
mounting
of
guns
in
circular
revolving
turrets
thus
giving
an
fire
and
on
the
whole
making
possible
an
adequate
protection
of
the
exposed
parts
of
the
ship
and
providing
for
the
combination
in
maximum
proportions
of
armored
protection
and
heavy
guns
for
offence
on
the
destroyer
the
means
of
defence
consisted
simply
in
a
light
deflecting
deck
armor
forward
the
vessel
being
intended
to
fight
bows
on
and
depending
on
her
means
of
offence
rather
than
defence
which
were
made
quite
secondary
in
character
the
monitor
however
was
ericsson
great
contribution
to
the
art
of
naval
war
and
with
it
his
name
will
always
be
associated
it
broke
with
the
past
in
every
way
it
reduced
the
number
of
guns
from
many
to
few
two
or
at
most
four
it
reduced
the
freeboard
from
the
lofty
topsides
of
the
old
to
an
insignificant
two
or
three
feet
and
thus
made
of
the
target
a
circular
fort
and
a
strip
of
armor
it
placed
the
guns
in
this
circular
fort
and
covered
it
with
armor
thick
enough
to
insure
safety
against
any
guns
then
afloat
and
thus
as
perfectly
as
the
engineering
means
of
the
day
would
permit
insured
the
combination
of
offensive
and
defensive
features
in
maximum
degree
it
cleared
away
at
one
stroke
masts
sails
and
all
the
lofty
which
since
time
immemorial
had
seemed
as
much
an
essential
feature
of
the
fighting
ship
as
the
guns
themselves
it
transformed
the
design
of
the
fighting
ship
from
the
older
ideals
expressed
in
the
american
frigate
constitution
or
the
english
victory
to
the
simplest
terms
of
offence
defence
and
steam
it
made
of
the
a
machine
rather
than
a
ship
an
engine
of
destruction
to
be
operated
by
engineers
rather
than
by
officers
of
the
ancient
and
traditional
type
there
is
small
wonder
that
in
all
quarters
the
idea
of
ships
of
this
type
was
not
received
with
enthusiasm
the
break
with
the
past
was
too
definite
and
complete
the
monitor
type
represented
simply
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
naval
warfare
worked
out
by
a
man
untrammelled
by
the
traditions
of
the
past
and
determined
only
on
reducing
such
a
ship
to
the
simplest
terms
of
offence
and
defence
as
expressed
by
the
engineering
materials
and
possibilities
of
the
day
judged
from
this
standpoint
the
vessel
seems
beyond
criticism
she
filled
perfectly
the
ideal
set
before
himself
by
her
designer
and
represents
as
a
complete
and
harmonious
whole
what
must
still
be
recognized
as
the
most
perfect
solution
of
the
problem
in
terms
of
the
possibilities
of
those
days
it
is
proper
here
that
due
reference
should
be
made
to
the
claims
in
behalf
of
theodore
timby
as
an
inventor
of
the
turret
and
of
the
monitor
idea
as
expressed
thereby
these
claims
and
the
main
facts
in
the
case
have
long
been
known
and
there
should
certainly
be
no
attempt
to
take
from
any
one
his
due
share
in
the
developments
which
gave
to
our
nation
a
monitor
in
her
hour
of
need
it
is
well
known
that
timby
between
and
conceived
the
idea
of
a
revolving
fort
of
iron
mounted
with
numerous
guns
and
intended
to
take
the
place
of
the
masonry
or
in
common
use
for
such
purposes
he
seems
also
to
have
conceived
of
a
similar
structure
for
use
on
a
ship
of
low
freeboard
and
a
model
showing
such
a
design
was
constructed
in
he
filed
a
caveat
for
the
invention
of
the
revolving
turret
here
the
matter
apparently
rested
until
and
after
the
battle
between
the
monitor
and
merrimac
when
he
took
out
a
patent
which
was
dated
july
covering
a
revolving
tower
for
defensive
and
offensive
warfare
whether
on
land
or
water
ericsson
associates
in
the
business
of
building
monitors
for
the
government
acquired
these
patents
of
timby
presumably
as
shrewd
business
men
in
order
to
quiet
any
claim
on
his
part
and
to
have
the
plan
available
for
land
forts
should
the
opportunity
arise
to
push
the
business
in
this
direction
there
is
no
question
but
that
ericsson
was
antedated
by
timby
in
the
suggestion
of
a
revolving
turret
at
least
in
so
far
as
public
notice
is
concerned
ericsson
frankly
admitted
this
and
stated
that
he
made
no
claim
to
absolute
originality
in
this
respect
he
further
stated
what
is
undoubtedly
true
that
the
main
idea
in
the
turret
that
of
a
circular
revolving
fort
antedates
the
nineteenth
century
as
a
whole
and
its
origin
is
lost
in
the
uncertainties
of
early
tradition
it
is
simply
one
of
those
early
ideas
which
naturally
must
have
been
known
in
essence
since
time
immemorial
and
as
such
it
was
the
common
property
of
the
engineering
practice
of
the
century
it
belongs
neither
to
timby
nor
to
ericsson
and
no
claims
regarding
priority
in
this
respect
are
worthy
of
serious
consideration
the
question
is
not
who
first
conceived
the
idea
of
a
revolving
fort
but
who
designed
and
built
the
monitor
as
she
was
and
as
she
met
the
merrimac
on
the
of
march
the
answer
to
the
latter
is
too
well
known
a
part
of
the
history
of
the
times
to
admit
of
question
or
to
call
for
further
notice
ericsson
claim
for
recognition
in
this
respect
rests
not
on
any
priority
of
idea
regarding
the
use
of
a
circular
fort
but
rather
upon
the
actual
monitor
as
she
was
built
and
as
she
crushed
at
one
blow
the
of
the
south
and
representing
as
it
did
a
completely
and
carefully
designed
whole
dating
back
to
the
earlier
dealings
with
napoleon
iii
in
this
is
an
age
which
judges
men
by
what
they
do
and
judged
by
this
standard
claims
in
connection
with
the
monitor
type
of
warship
are
never
likely
to
be
seriously
questioned
taking
ericsson
life
and
work
what
portion
remains
as
a
permanent
acquisition
or
as
a
part
of
the
practice
of
the
present
age
this
is
a
question
which
merits
at
least
a
moment
notice
we
should
not
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
permanency
is
necessarily
a
test
of
merit
or
that
the
value
of
his
services
to
the
world
should
be
judged
by
such
parts
of
his
work
as
are
plainly
apparent
in
the
practice
of
the
present
day
a
piece
of
work
must
be
judged
by
the
circumstances
which
brought
it
forth
and
by
the
completeness
and
perfection
of
its
adaptation
to
the
needs
and
possibilities
of
its
age
we
have
then
the
steam
compressed
air
which
he
early
employed
in
england
and
which
has
become
an
instrument
of
enormous
importance
in
connection
with
the
industrial
progress
of
the
age
although
this
is
in
no
especial
degree
due
to
his
efforts
the
surface
condenser
distiller
and
evaporator
are
a
permanently
and
absolutely
essential
part
of
modern
marine
practice
the
has
almost
sole
possession
of
the
field
of
marine
propulsion
modern
marine
engines
and
boilers
in
naval
practice
are
always
placed
below
the
and
are
protected
by
deflective
deck
armor
and
frequently
by
coal
as
well
the
turret
has
become
a
permanent
and
accepted
part
of
the
practice
of
the
age
while
the
monitor
type
in
its
essential
feature
seems
to
be
evanescent
the
modern
battleship
is
a
vastly
more
complex
structure
and
represents
more
complex
ideas
and
combinations
than
did
monitor
it
contains
a
battery
of
guns
of
the
heaviest
type
known
to
naval
ordnance
at
present
such
guns
are
usually
of
bore
and
throw
a
shell
of
about
pounds
weight
with
an
initial
velocity
of
nearly
feet
per
second
then
there
is
a
supporting
battery
of
guns
or
inches
in
diameter
of
bore
and
finally
a
secondary
battery
of
smaller
guns
throwing
shells
of
from
pound
to
or
pounds
weight
and
added
to
these
there
may
be
a
torpedo
outfit
as
well
the
exigencies
of
fighting
ships
at
sea
and
in
all
weathers
seems
to
have
pronounced
against
the
monitor
type
with
its
low
freeboard
as
unsuitable
for
use
on
the
open
sea
while
the
enormous
advances
in
modern
guns
and
armor
have
made
a
totally
different
problem
of
the
distribution
of
means
offensive
and
defensive
again
the
monitor
type
was
never
intended
for
long
cruising
or
indeed
for
other
service
than
the
defence
of
coasts
and
harbors
the
policy
of
building
a
vessel
thus
adapted
only
to
an
inner
line
of
defence
and
not
adapted
to
an
outer
line
of
defence
and
offence
as
well
has
been
further
called
in
question
and
the
judgment
of
the
present
day
has
decided
against
such
policy
it
is
true
that
in
the
new
navy
begun
in
one
monitor
the
monterey
has
been
built
while
four
others
of
older
type
have
been
somewhat
modernized
and
there
are
three
monitors
building
at
the
present
time
it
may
be
doubted
however
if
they
will
be
followed
by
others
at
least
so
long
as
the
conditions
of
naval
warfare
and
the
spirit
of
public
policy
remain
as
they
now
are
the
monitor
type
was
a
perfect
solution
of
the
problem
of
its
day
and
nobly
it
answered
the
calls
made
on
it
the
problem
has
now
changed
the
conditions
affecting
its
solution
have
also
changed
and
it
is
no
discredit
to
the
original
type
that
it
now
seems
to
have
had
its
day
and
that
it
must
give
way
to
other
forms
more
perfectly
expressing
the
spirit
of
the
present
age
and
the
means
available
for
the
solution
of
problems
in
the
art
of
naval
war
in
many
ways
however
the
influence
of
ericsson
work
still
lives
in
the
modern
battleship
and
while
in
our
modern
designs
we
have
gotten
far
away
from
the
essential
features
of
the
monitor
type
yet
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
the
germ
of
the
modern
battleship
is
in
many
ways
found
in
the
monitor
especially
as
expressed
in
terms
of
concentration
of
heavy
and
localized
protection
of
gun
positions
and
in
more
ways
than
may
be
suspected
the
influence
of
ericsson
and
of
his
work
had
its
part
in
the
developments
which
have
led
to
the
splendid
designs
of
the
present
day
returning
again
to
our
note
of
the
dependence
of
the
present
age
on
ericsson
mention
may
be
made
of
the
blower
for
forcing
the
combustion
in
as
a
feature
of
standard
marine
practice
and
one
absolutely
essential
to
the
development
of
the
highest
attainable
speeds
such
as
are
required
in
warships
and
especially
in
those
of
the
torpedo
and
modern
destroyer
types
likewise
the
use
of
the
fan
for
ventilation
as
used
by
him
in
his
early
practice
has
become
a
necessity
of
modern
conditions
both
on
naval
and
passenger
ships
for
the
health
and
comfort
of
both
passengers
and
crew
his
long
series
of
experiments
and
his
years
of
labor
on
air
and
other
forms
of
caloric
engine
are
only
represented
by
the
ericsson
now
on
the
market
and
having
its
fair
share
of
service
in
locations
where
simplicity
of
operation
and
scarcity
of
water
may
naturally
suggest
its
use
of
his
labors
in
connection
with
a
solar
engine
and
with
other
questions
which
occupied
much
of
the
time
of
his
closing
years
we
have
but
little
direct
result
others
are
at
work
on
the
idea
of
the
solar
engine
and
it
may
be
that
a
practicable
solution
of
the
problem
will
be
found
ericsson
lasting
imprint
on
engineering
practice
curious
as
it
may
seem
was
made
in
his
earlier
and
middle
life
rather
than
in
his
later
years
and
we
have
even
more
in
the
way
of
permanent
acquisition
from
his
earlier
than
from
his
middle
years
this
results
from
the
fact
that
in
middle
life
he
was
largely
engaged
on
warship
designs
admirably
adapted
to
the
needs
of
the
time
and
to
the
possibilities
of
the
age
but
no
longer
suited
to
either
while
in
later
life
he
no
longer
found
it
necessary
to
work
at
problems
which
would
produce
a
direct
financial
return
and
therefore
interested
himself
in
a
variety
of
questions
somewhat
farther
removed
from
the
walks
of
engineering
practice
than
those
with
which
he
was
occupied
in
earlier
life
in
personality
ericsson
possessed
the
most
pronounced
and
characteristics
professionally
he
felt
that
to
him
had
been
granted
a
larger
measure
of
insight
than
to
others
into
the
mysteries
of
nature
as
expressed
in
the
laws
of
mechanics
and
he
was
therefore
little
disposed
to
listen
to
the
advice
or
criticism
of
those
about
him
this
was
undoubtedly
one
of
ericsson
most
pronounced
professional
faults
he
did
not
realize
that
with
all
his
insight
into
the
laws
of
mechanics
and
all
his
capacity
for
applying
these
laws
to
the
solution
of
the
problems
under
consideration
he
might
well
make
some
use
of
the
work
of
his
in
the
same
field
so
little
disposed
was
he
to
thus
use
the
work
of
others
that
a
given
device
or
idea
which
had
been
in
previous
use
was
often
rejected
and
search
made
for
another
different
and
original
even
though
it
might
involve
only
some
relatively
trivial
part
of
the
work
he
was
simply
unwilling
to
follow
in
the
lead
of
others
he
must
lead
or
have
none
of
it
and
thus
the
fact
that
a
device
or
expedient
was
in
common
use
would
furnish
an
argument
against
rather
than
for
its
adoption
his
natural
mode
of
work
was
utterly
to
disregard
precedent
and
to
seek
for
fundamental
solutions
of
his
problems
having
only
in
view
the
conditions
to
be
fulfilled
the
laws
of
mechanics
and
the
engineering
materials
of
construction
this
habit
of
independence
and
of
seclusion
within
the
narrow
circle
of
his
own
work
so
grew
upon
him
in
later
years
that
mechanical
science
made
many
advances
of
which
he
took
little
or
no
note
and
of
which
he
refused
to
avail
himself
even
though
he
might
have
done
so
greatly
to
his
own
advantage
in
his
later
years
in
a
letter
to
his
friend
captain
adlersparre
he
says
do
not
laugh
at
me
now
captain
when
i
say
that
nobody
can
mislead
me
do
not
condemn
me
if
i
at
the
same
time
confess
that
i
am
directed
by
nobody
judgment
but
my
own
and
that
i
never
consult
anybody
and
take
nobody
advice
in
all
matters
connected
with
his
work
his
will
was
imperious
and
he
would
brook
no
interference
or
criticism
his
temper
was
high
his
organization
sensitive
and
many
times
throughout
his
life
relations
with
his
best
friends
became
strained
by
his
instability
of
temper
or
impatience
with
what
he
might
construe
as
a
criticism
regarding
his
work
with
this
instability
of
temper
however
was
combined
a
tenderness
and
kindness
of
heart
and
he
was
as
quick
to
forget
the
cause
of
offence
as
he
was
to
manifest
displeasure
upon
occasion
notwithstanding
the
asperities
of
ericsson
character
in
regard
to
his
professional
work
and
his
entire
lack
of
effort
to
make
friends
among
the
learned
of
his
day
recognition
and
unsought
honors
came
in
upon
him
he
was
elected
to
honorary
membership
in
the
societies
of
note
in
the
united
states
and
sweden
and
in
addition
to
the
thanks
of
congress
and
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
he
received
a
resolution
of
thanks
from
the
swedish
riksdag
or
parliament
in
in
he
was
granted
the
rarely
bestowed
rumford
medal
and
received
at
other
times
during
his
life
medals
honors
and
decorations
such
as
have
perhaps
fallen
to
no
other
who
has
wrought
in
the
same
field
of
human
effort
while
recognition
of
this
character
pleased
him
greatly
when
it
came
spontaneously
and
willingly
he
placed
but
little
value
on
that
which
he
thought
grudgingly
or
tardily
tendered
and
in
one
or
two
instances
refused
membership
in
societies
which
he
thought
granted
in
that
manner
a
large
measure
of
this
independence
of
character
is
necessary
to
the
performance
of
the
work
which
ericsson
did
had
he
been
ever
ready
to
listen
to
the
views
of
others
and
to
modify
his
ideas
in
accordance
with
them
his
greatest
achievements
would
never
have
been
accomplished
in
ericsson
however
this
characteristic
was
carried
to
an
undue
extreme
and
he
might
unquestionably
have
accomplished
more
had
he
been
able
to
with
others
and
to
accept
and
use
freely
the
best
work
of
contemporaries
in
his
own
field
ericsson
was
essentially
a
designing
rather
than
a
constructing
engineer
his
genius
lay
in
new
adaptations
of
the
principles
of
mechanics
or
in
new
combinations
of
the
elements
of
engineering
practice
in
such
way
as
to
further
the
purposes
in
view
his
mode
of
expression
was
the
while
he
wrote
vigorously
and
well
and
while
he
was
a
frequent
contributor
in
later
years
to
scientific
literature
especially
on
the
subject
of
solar
physics
yet
his
best
and
natural
mode
of
expression
was
the
graphical
representation
of
his
designs
on
the
forms
and
combinations
took
shape
in
his
brain
and
were
transferred
to
the
drawing
with
marvellous
speed
and
skill
those
who
have
been
associated
with
him
bear
testimony
that
the
amount
of
his
work
was
simply
astounding
and
that
only
by
a
combination
of
the
most
remarkable
celerity
and
industry
could
they
have
been
accomplished
these
drawings
were
furthermore
so
minute
in
detail
and
so
accurate
in
dimension
that
as
a
rule
he
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
give
further
attention
to
the
matter
after
it
had
left
his
hands
of
the
many
parts
of
a
complicated
mechanism
one
could
be
sent
for
construction
to
one
shop
and
another
elsewhere
all
ultimately
coming
together
and
making
a
harmonious
and
perfectly
fitting
whole
in
no
other
way
could
such
astonishing
speed
in
the
detailed
construction
of
the
monitor
and
other
vessels
of
her
type
possibly
have
been
made
and
the
fact
that
such
speed
in
construction
was
obtained
and
largely
in
this
manner
is
by
no
means
the
least
impressive
of
the
many
evidences
of
genius
as
a
designer
the
designs
once
completed
on
the
however
interest
in
the
work
ceased
in
great
measure
and
as
a
rule
he
paid
but
little
attention
to
constructive
details
and
took
but
slight
interest
in
the
completed
whole
thus
he
is
said
to
have
visited
his
destroyer
but
once
after
she
was
built
and
then
simply
in
search
of
his
assistant
he
also
declined
an
invitation
from
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
to
visit
hampton
roads
and
inspect
the
monitor
immediately
after
her
fight
with
the
merrimac
he
seemed
to
have
no
curiosity
to
inspect
his
work
after
it
had
left
his
hands
or
to
receive
a
report
as
to
the
practical
working
of
his
designs
this
shows
a
peculiar
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
value
of
intimate
contact
with
constructive
and
operative
engineering
work
no
one
could
hope
to
avoid
errors
or
to
realize
by
alone
the
best
possible
solution
of
engineering
problems
ericsson
wilfully
handicapped
himself
in
this
manner
and
might
unquestionably
have
more
effectively
improved
and
perfected
his
ideas
had
he
been
disposed
to
combine
with
his
designs
at
the
practical
contact
with
his
work
as
constructed
his
work
was
all
done
in
his
office
at
his
house
for
the
last
years
of
his
life
he
lived
at
beach
street
new
york
where
he
wrought
every
day
in
the
year
and
often
until
far
into
the
night
his
office
contained
beside
his
and
other
furniture
a
long
table
on
which
at
times
when
overcome
by
fatigue
he
would
stretch
himself
and
take
a
short
nap
using
a
dictionary
or
low
wooden
box
for
a
pillow
his
relations
with
his
native
land
were
always
close
and
as
already
hinted
he
gave
much
of
his
best
effort
to
the
study
of
means
for
her
defence
toward
his
friends
and
relatives
he
was
the
embodiment
of
watchful
care
and
generosity
his
private
benefactions
were
for
his
means
large
and
were
given
with
a
generosity
which
must
have
added
much
to
the
love
and
esteem
in
which
the
recipients
regarded
him
his
public
benefactions
were
also
notable
and
during
the
later
years
of
his
life
he
gave
away
regularly
no
inconsiderable
share
of
his
income
though
gifted
with
reasonable
prudence
he
had
no
conception
of
the
business
sense
and
no
capacity
as
a
after
acquiring
by
his
inventions
and
enterprise
a
modest
competence
he
devoted
himself
almost
entirely
to
work
less
directly
related
to
a
financial
return
and
lived
comfortably
upon
the
principal
which
his
earlier
efforts
had
provided
ericsson
had
absolute
faith
in
himself
and
in
his
mission
to
render
available
the
energies
of
nature
for
the
uses
of
humanity
and
civilization
his
character
was
framed
about
the
central
idea
of
fidelity
to
this
mission
he
was
dogmatic
and
optimistic
as
regards
his
own
work
he
had
a
contemptuous
indifference
to
the
work
of
others
and
a
disregard
of
the
help
which
he
might
derive
from
a
closer
study
of
such
work
he
trained
himself
body
mind
and
affections
solely
with
reference
to
his
mission
and
allowed
no
interference
with
it
he
was
the
embodiment
of
physical
and
mental
vigor
prodigious
industry
continuity
of
purpose
indomitable
courage
capacity
for
great
concentration
of
mind
and
oblivion
to
all
distracting
surroundings
with
such
characteristics
combined
with
the
rare
endowment
of
mental
capacity
and
insight
regarding
the
principles
of
engineering
science
small
wonder
is
it
that
his
life
was
one
so
rich
in
results
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
and
the
results
simply
came
as
a
consequence
of
the
combination
of
the
characteristics
of
the
man
and
the
surroundings
in
which
he
was
placed
the
question
as
to
how
much
more
or
how
much
better
he
might
have
done
had
he
possessed
more
faith
in
the
work
of
others
and
a
willingness
to
be
guided
in
some
measure
by
their
experience
is
of
course
idle
ericsson
was
a
combination
of
certain
capacities
and
characteristics
a
combination
of
other
capacities
and
characteristics
would
not
have
been
ericsson
and
any
discussion
of
such
a
supposition
is
therefore
aside
from
the
purpose
of
this
sketch
john
ericsson
lived
in
a
period
of
rapid
engineering
development
and
change
old
ideals
were
passing
away
and
the
heritage
which
the
nineteenth
century
was
able
to
pass
on
to
the
twentieth
was
in
preparation
in
this
preparation
ericsson
bore
a
large
and
most
important
part
so
long
as
ships
traverse
the
seas
ericsson
name
will
be
remembered
for
his
work
in
connection
with
the
introduction
of
the
so
long
as
the
memory
of
naval
warfare
endures
ericsson
name
will
be
remembered
for
the
part
which
he
bore
in
the
transition
from
wood
to
iron
from
unarmored
ships
to
turrets
and
armor
from
scattered
to
concentrated
energy
of
and
for
his
general
share
in
the
developments
which
have
led
to
the
ideal
of
a
battleship
prevailing
at
the
opening
of
the
twentieth
century
for
these
and
for
many
other
achievements
he
will
be
remembered
and
his
life
and
works
should
serve
as
a
constant
stimulus
to
those
upon
whom
the
engineering
work
of
the
present
age
has
fallen
to
see
that
with
equal
fidelity
they
live
up
to
the
possibilities
of
their
endowments
and
opportunities
and
serve
with
like
fervency
and

in
peking
the

having
known
him
long
and

called
one
morning
to
request
a
letter

for

that

nobody

what

he
exclaimed
smiling
from
ear
to
ear
at
the
thought
of
his
reputation
this
was
taking
him
on
his
weak
side
but
it
was
fact
not
flattery
over
forty
years
ago
li
rising
star
first
came
to
view
in
connection
with
operations
against
the
rebels
in
the
vicinity
of
shanghai
and
from
that
day
to
this
every
war
domestic
or
foreign
has
served
to
raise
it
higher
and
make
it
shine
the
brighter
it
reached
its
zenith
in
when
after
settling
terms
of
peace
with
several
foreign
powers
he
passed
off
the
stage
at
the
ripe
age
of
fourscore
what
better
type
to
set
forth
his
age
and
nation
than
the
man
who
through
a
long
career
of
unexampled
activity
won
for
himself
a
triple
crown
of
literary
military
and
civil
honors
in
physique
he
was
a
noble
specimen
of
his
race
over
six
feet
in
height
and
in
his
earlier
years
uncommonly
handsome
the
first
half
of
his
existence
was
passed
in
comparative
obscurity
at
hofei
in
anhui
a
region
remote
from
contact
with
foreign
nations
it
was
there
his
character
was
formed
on
native
models
there
he
carried
off
the
higher
prizes
of
the
literary
arena
and
there
he
became
fitted
for
the
role
of
china
typical
statesman
his
career
in
outline
may
be
stated
in
a
few
words
his
native
province
being
overrun
by
rebels
he
passed
from
the
to
the
camp
and
got
his
earliest
lessons
in
the
military
art
under
the
leadership
of
the
eminent
viceroy
tseng
ko
fan
the
neighboring
province
of
kiangsu
falling
into
the
hands
of
rebel
hordes
a
few
years
later
he
won
renown
by
recapturing
its
principal
cities
by
the
aid
of
such
men
as
the
american
ward
and
the
english
gordon
his
success
as
a
general
made
him
governor
of
kiangsu
and
his
success
as
governor
raised
him
to
the
rank
of
viceroy
holding
for
many
years
a
post
at
one
or
other
of
the
foci
of
foreign
trade
north
or
south
beyond
the
borders
of
china
he
was
twice
sent
on
special
embassies
and
once
he
made
the
tour
of
the
globe
but
his
most
brilliant
achievement
was
in
twice
making
peace
on
honorable
terms
when
his
country
was
lying
prostrate
before
a
victorious
enemy
it
remains
to
expand
this
incomparable
catalogue
but
to
make
intelligible
that
remarkable
series
of
events
in
which
he
bore
such
a
conspicuous
part
we
must
first
invite
our
readers
to
accompany
us
in
a
historical
retrospect
in
which
we
shall
point
out
the
opening
and
growth
of
foreign
intercourse
intercourse
with
china
by
land
of
the
nature
of
that
intercourse
in
its
earlier
period
there
exists
a
monument
that
speaks
volumes
that
is
no
other
than
the
great
wall
which
hugest
of
the
works
of
man
stretches
along
the
northern
frontier
of
china
proper
for
one
thousand
five
hundred
miles
from
the
sea
to
the
desert
of
gobi
erected
it
shows
that
even
at
that
early
date
the
enemies
most
dreaded
by
the
chinese
were
on
the
north
yet
how
signally
it
failed
to
effect
its
purpose
for
since
that
epoch
the
provinces
of
northern
china
have
passed
no
fewer
than
seven
centuries
under
tartar
sway
two
tartar
dynasties
have
succeeded
in
subjugating
the
whole
empire
and
they
have
transmitted
beyond
the
seas
a
reputation
which
quite
eclipses
the
fame
of
china
ancient
sovereigns
in
fact
that
which
first
made
china
known
to
the
western
world
was
its
conquest
by
the
mongols
in
the
thirteenth
century
barbarous
nomads
with
longing
eyes
forever
directed
to
the
sunny
plains
of
the
south
they
also
conquered
india
bringing
under
their
sceptre
the
two
richest
regions
of
the
globe
of
genghis
and
kubla
it
may
be
asserted
that
they
realized
a
more
extended
dominion
than
alexander
caesar
or
napoleon
ever
dreamed
of
but
extended
empire

which
wrought
this

on

is
only
one
of

discoveries
made
by
the
ancient
chinese
which
unfruitful
in

after

the
magnetic
needle
in
china
continues
to
be
called
by
a
name
which
means
that
it
points
to
the
south
it
heads
a
long
list
of
contraries
in
the
notions
of
the
chinese
as
compared
with
our
own
such
for
example
as
beginning
to
read
at
the

of

book
placing
the
seat
of
honor
on
the

keeping
to
the
left

on

with

others
so
numerous
as
to

that

law
that
placed
their
feet
opposite
to
ours
must
have
turned
their
heads
the
other
way
to
the

the
needle
continued
to
be
a
mere
plaything
to
be
seen
every
day
in
the

in

employed

we
not
seen
even
in
this
our

the
rank

of
the
chinese
army

with

the

was
known
in
china
five
centuries
before
it
made
its
way

confucian

been
engraved
on
stone
to
secure
them
from
being

they
had
been
by
the

the
rubbings
taken
from

it
required
nothing
but
the
substitution
of
wood
for
stone
and
of
for
to
give
that
art

the

scrap
of

paper
in
the
lining
of
a
tea
chest
or
wrapped
about
a
roll
of
silk
would
suffice
to
suggest
the
whole
art
to
a
mind

that
of

it
never
emerged

attempt

introduce
metallic

having
proved
unsuccessful
for
the
want
of
that
happy
alloy
known
as
it
is
from
us
that
they
have
learned
the
art
of
casting

splendid
achievement
the
making
of

from

catholic

entered

and
his

impelled

of

with

two
thousand
years
before

but
their
science
had
made
no
headway
the
missionaries
found
their
calendar
in
a
state
of
confusion
vanquished
the
native
astronomers
in
fair
competition
and
were
formally
installed
as
keepers
of
the
imperial
observatory
and
these
missionaries
supervised
the
casting
of
the
bronze
instruments
which
have
since
been
taken
to
berlin
this
honor
they
retained
even
after
the
fall
of
the
native
dynasty
that
patronized
them
when
the
manchus
effected
their
conquest
in
not
only
were
the
jesuit
missionaries
left
in
charge
of
the
observatory

the
heir
apparent
was
placed
under
their
instruction
coming
to

throne

under
the
now
illustrious
title
of
the
young
prince
showed
himself
a
generous
patron
as
he
had
previously
been
a
respectful
pupil
he
was
apparently
not
averse
to
the
idea
of
his
people
adopting
christianity
as
their
national
religion
and
allowed
the
missionaries
a
free
hand
to
plant
churches
throughout
the
vast
interior
rarely
if
ever
has
so
fine
an
opportunity
offered
for
making
an
easy
conquest
of
a
pagan
empire
it
was
lost
through
the
jealousy
of
contending
societies
and
especially
through
the
blunder
of
an
infallible
pope
the
dominicans
denounced
the
jesuits
for
tolerating
the
practice
of
pagan
rites
such
as
the
worship
of
ancestors
and
for
employing
for
god
the
name
of
a
pagan
deity
the
name
which
they
then
objected
to
was
supreme
ruler
a
venerable
designation
for
the
supreme
power
found
in
the
earliest
of
the
chinese
canonical
books
and
at
this
day
accepted
by
a
large
proportion
of
protestant
missionaries
the
question
as
to
its
fitness
was
referred
to
the
emperor
who
decided
in
favor
of
the
jesuits
it
was
then
brought
before
the
papal
see
condemned
as
idolatrous
and
tien
chu
the
lord
of
heaven
adopted
in
its
stead
that
however
pure
in
origin
had
come
to
be
applied
to
a
whole
class
of
deities
was
perfectly
true
but
the
name
proposed
in
its
stead
was
not
free
from
a
taint
of
idolatry
tien
chu
lord
of
heaven
being
one
of
eight
divinities
and
worshipped
along
with
ti
chu
lord
of
earth
hai
chu
lord
of
the
sea
etc
the
manner
in
which
his
opinions
had
been
set
aside
by
the
pope
had
no
doubt
a
repelling
influence
on
the
mind
of
the
emperor
so
that
if
he
had
ever
felt
inclined
to
embrace
christianity
he
drew
back
in
his
later
years
not
only
so
but
he
left
behind
him
a
series
of
maxims
in
which
he
censures
the
foreign
creed
and
warns
his
people
against
it
these
maxims
were
ordered
to
be
read
in
public
by
mandarins
and
they
continue
to
be
recited
and
expounded
as
a
sort
of
religious
ritual
is
it
surprising
that
this
lost
opportunity
was
followed
by
a
century
and
a
half
of
open
persecution
that
most
of
the
churches
survived
not
only
attests
the
zeal
with
which
the
faith
had
been
propagated
it
throws
a
pleasing
light
on
the
force
of
the
chinese
character
at
the
dawn
of
our
new
epoch
there
were
still
some
half
a
million
converts
with
here
and
there
a
foreign
father
hiding
in
their
midst
in
bringing
about
this
change
of
policy
there
was
indeed
another
influence
at
work
had
not
the
emperor
of
china
heard
some
rumors
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
dominion
of
his
cousin
the
great
mogul
how
the
french
were
dispossessing
the
portuguese
and
how
the
english
later
on
succeeded
in
expelling
the
french
how
could
they
doubt
that
a
large
community
of
native
christians
would
act
as
an
auxiliary
to
any
foreign
invader
a
suspicion
of
this
kind
had
in
fact
sprung
up
under
the
preceding
dynasty
in
consequence
of
it
not
a
single
seaport
except
macao
was
opened
to
foreign
trade
and
when
foreigners
went
to
canton
they
were
lodged
in
a
suburb
and
not
allowed
to
penetrate
within
the
walls
of
the
provincial
capital
such
misgivings
as
to
the
designs
of
foreigners
we
find
strikingly
expressed
in
a
book
of
that
period
called
strange
stories
of
an
idle
student
one
story
is
as
follows
when
barbarians
first
appeared
on
our
coast
they
were
not
allowed
to
come
ashore
they
begged
however
to
be
permitted
to
spread
a
carpet
on
which
to
dry
their
goods
and
this
being
granted
they
took
the
carpet
by
its
corners
and
stretched
it
so
that
it
covered
several
acres
on
this
they
debarked
in
great
force
and
drawing
their
swords
took
possession
of
the
surrounding
country
iii
the
opium
war
the
first
great
event
that
woke
china
from
her
dream
of
solitary
grandeur
was
the
war
with
england
which
broke
out
in
and
was
closed
three
years
later
by
the
treaty
of
nanking
it
was
not
however
all
that
was
needed
to
effect
that
object
it
made
the
giant
rub
her
eyes
and
give
a
reluctant
assent
to
terms
imposed
by
superior
force
but
many
a
rude
lesson
was
still
required
before
she
came
to
perceive
her
true
position
as
on
the
lower
side
of
an
inclined
plane
to
bring
her
to
this
discovery
four
more
foreign
wars
were
to
follow
before
the
end
of
the
century
culminating
in
a
siege
in
peking
and
massacres
throughout
the
northern
provinces
which
may
be
looked
on
as
the
fifth
act
in
a
long
and
bloody
tragedy
in
the
last
three
wars
li
hung
chang
was
a
prominent
actor
in
the
first
two
he
took
no
part
yet
was
it
the
shock
which
they
gave
to
the
empire
that
drove
him
from
a
life
of
literary
seclusion
to
do
battle
in
a
more
public
arena
the
opium
war
of
is
not
improperly
so
designated
but
nothing
is
more
erroneous
than
to
infer
that
it
was
waged
by
england
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
the
product
of
her
indian
poppy
fields
on
the
markets
of
china
opium
was
the
occasion
not
the
cause
the
cause
if
we
are
to
put
it
in
a
single
word
was
the
overbearing
arrogance
of
an
oriental
despotism
which
refused
to
recognize
any
equal
in
the
family
of
nations
in
the
straits
settlements
and
in
the
seaports
of
india
chinese
merchants
had
been
brought
under
sway
of
the
bewitching
narcotic
it
found
its
way
to
their
southern
seaports
and
without
being
recognized
as
an
article
of
commerce
the
trade
expanded
with
startling
rapidity
the
emperor
tao
kwang
one
of
the
most
humane
of
rulers
resolved
to
take
measures
for
the
suppression
of
the
vice
he
had
come
to
the
throne
in
and
there
is
a
story
that
he
was
moved
to
action
by
the
untimely
fate
of
his
eldest
son
who
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
seductive
poison
commissioner
lin
whom
he
selected
to
carry
out
his
prohibitory
policy
was
a
fit
instrument
for
such
a
master
equally
virtuous
in
his
aims
and
equally
tyrannical
in
his
mode
of
proceeding
arriving
at
canton
his
first
object
was
to
get
possession
of
the
forbidden
drug
which
was
stored
on
ships
outside
the
harbor
this
he
thought
to
accomplish
by
surrounding
the
whole
foreign
community
by
soldiers
and
threatening
them
with
death
if
the
opium
was
not
promptly
surrendered
while

up
from

then
called
on

the

five
ports
were
opened

on

the

in

his
prohibitory
decrees
against

issued
an
edict
of
toleration
if
the
opening
of
the
ports
gave
a
stimulus
to

the
decree
of
toleration
opened
a
door
for
missionary
enterprise

yet
however
neither

nor
missionary
was
allowed
to
penetrate
into
the
interior
while
the

the
whole
of

northern
seacoast
remained
inaccessible
this
was
obviously
a
state
of
things
that
could
not
be
permanent
yet
fifteen
years
were
to
pass
before
another
war
came
to
settle
the

broader
basis
when

li
hung
chang
was
seventeen
years
of
age
living
at
hofei
in
anhui
as
there
were
then
no
newspapers
in
china
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
heard
of
it
until
a
british
squadron
sailed
up
to
nanking
and
extorted
a
treaty
at
the
cannon
mouth
li
was
rudely
startled
by
the
appearance
of
a
new
force
to
which
there
was
no
allusion
in
any
of
his
ancient
books
along
with

were
two

he
was
supposed
to
be
born
to
the
pursuit
of

he
did
in
fact
devote
himself
to
study
with
unflagging
zeal
because
he
had
as
yet
no
temptation
to
turn
aside
was
there
not
moreover
an
open
door
before
his
face
inviting
him
to
win
for
himself
the
honors
of
a
mandarinate
in
his
native
town
he
placed
his
foot
on
the
first
step
of
the
ladder
by
gaining
the
degree
of
or
in
chinese
budding
genius
at
the
provincial
capital
he
next
carried
off
the
laurel
of
the
second
degree
which
is
worth
more
than
our
not
merely
because
it
is
not
conferred
in
course
but
because
it
falls
to
the
lot
of
only
one
in
a
hundred
among
some
thousands
of
competitors
these
provincial
tournaments
occur
but
once
in
three
years
and
the
successful
candidates
proceed
to
peking
to
compete
for
the
third
degree

for

here
the
chances
amount
to
three
per

li
fortunes
were
again
propitious
and
in
company
with
two
or
three
hundred
doctors
he
was
summoned
to
the
palace
to
contend
in

of
the
emperor
for
the
honor
of
a
seat
in
the
imperial
academy
the
hanlin
or
forest
of
pencils
here
also
he
met
with
success
but
he
was
not
among
the
first
three
whose
names
are
marked
by
the
vermilion
pen
of
majesty
each
of
whom
sheds
lustre
on
his

of
the
three

called

announced
to

conducted
her
to
the
six
gates
at

of

she
scattered
a
handful
of

as
an
omen
of
good
fortune
in

when

this
honor

for
the
first
time
conferred
on

of

handwriting
goes
for
nothing
but
in
this
it
is
not
without
weight

to
select

the
service
of

on
those
occasions
extent
of
erudition
and
originality
of

are
the
qualities
most
esteemed
but
this
time
the
order
of
merit
is
decided
by
superficial
elegance
of
style
and
by
facility
in
the
composition
of
verse
however
defective
the
standard
of
learning
this
long
course
of
competition
extending
over
ten

fifteen

the
effect
of
bringing
before
the
throne
a
body
of
men
each
of

is
the
survivor
of
a
hundred
contests
no
country
can
boast
a

system
for

for
tampering
with
this
of

for
ages
it
has
provided
the
state
with
able
officers
nor
is
its
least
merit
that
of
converting
a
dangerous
demagogue
into
a
quiet
student
while
waiting
for
an
appointment
li
heard
with
dismay
that
nanking
had
been
taken
by
a
body
of
rebels
and
that
his
native
province
was
in
danger
of
being
overrun
by
them
a
new
career
opened
before
him
one
that
led
more
directly
to
the
highest
offices
within
the
gift
of
the
sovereign
asking
a
commission
in
the
army
he
was
assigned
to
a
position
on
the
staff
of
tsengkofan
father
of
the
marquis
tseng
who
was
afterwards
minister
to
england
this
rebellion
among
the
strangest
of
strange
things
now
claims
our
attention
iv
the
taiping
rebellion
in
april
the
news
reached
us
that
nanking
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
body
of
rebels
who
by
a
curious
irony
called
themselves
taipings
soldiers
of
peace
they
were
chinese
not
manchus
and
their
leaders
were
all
from
the
extreme
south
starting
near
canton
they
had
proclaimed
as
their
object
the
expulsion
of
the
tartars
overrunning
kwangsi
and
hunan
they
had
got
possession
of
hankow
and
the
two
adjacent
cities
a
centre
of
wealth
which
may
be
compared
to
the
three
cities
that
form
our
greater
new
york
everywhere
they
put
to
flight
the
government
forces
but
they
did
not
choose
to
stop
anywhere
short
of
the
ancient
capital
of
the
mings
seizing
some
thousands
of
junks
they
filled
them
with
the
plunder
of
that
rich
mart
and
sweeping
down
the
river
carried
by
assault
every
city
on
its
banks
until
they
reached
nanking
its
resistance
was
quickly
overcome
and
putting
to
death
the
entire
garrison
of
thousand
manchus
they
announced
their
intention
to
make
it
the
capital
of
their
empire
as
hung
wu
had
done
when
he
drove
out
the
mongols
and
restored
freedom
to
the
chinese
race
in
a
few
months
they
despatched
an
expedition
to
expel
the
manchus
from
peking
but
that
proved
a
more
difficult
task
than
they
expected
before
the
detachment
had
arrived
at
tientsin
it
was
met
on
the
grand
canal
by
a
strong
force
under
sengkolinsin
the
mongol
prince
obliged
to
winter
on
the
way
it
was
divided
and
cut
off
in
detail
this
defeat
making
it
evident
to
all
the
world
that
the
manchu
domination
might
still
hope
for
a
considerable
lease
of
life
the
blood
and
rapine
which
everywhere
marked
their
pathway
alienated
the
sympathy
of
foreigners
from
the
soldiers
of
peace
nor
did
the
new
power
at
nanking
manifest
the
least
anxiety
to
obtain
foreign
aid
feeling
assured
of
ultimate
triumph
yet
indifferent
as
they
were
to
the
of
foreigners
the
taipings
proclaimed
themselves
christians
and
appeared
to
aim
their
blows
no
less
at
lifeless
idols
than
at
living
enemies
shangti
the
supreme
ruler
the
god
of
the
ancient
sages
was
the
object
of
their
worship
they
found
his
name
in
the
christian
bibles
and
they
published
the
bible
as
the
source
of
their
new
faith
their
faith
amounted
to
a
frenzy
giving
them
courage
in
battle
but
not
imparting
the
essential
to
christian
morality
filling
their
coffers
with
spoil
they
stocked
their
harems
with
the
wives
and
daughters
of
their
enemies
if
their
lives
had
been
more
decent
they
might
have
had
a
better
chance
to
secure
the
favor
of
those
powerful
nations
which
had
now
become
the
arbiters
of
destiny
in
china
the
leader
of
the
movement
was
a
cantonese
by
the
name
of
hung
siu
chuen
a
copy
of
the
bible
having
fallen
into
his
hands
he
applied
to
a
baptist
missionary
for
instruction
how
much
he
learned
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
he
gave
his
followers
a
new
form
of
baptism
requiring
them
to
wash
the
bosom
as
a
sign
for
cleansing
the
heart
he
had
ecstatic
visions
and
preached
a
crusade
against
idolatry
and
the
manchus
the
ease
with
which
the
manchus
had
been
beaten
by
the
british
in
had
revealed
their
weakness
and
the
new
faith
supplied
the
rebels
with
a
fresh
source
of
power
they
mixed
the
teachings
of
the
gospel
with
new
revelations
as
freely
as
mohammed
did
in
propagating
the
religion
of
the
koran
the
chief
called
himself
the
younger
brother
of
jesus
christ
his
prime
minister
assumed
the
title
of
the
holy
ghost
and
his
counsels
were
given
out
as
decrees
from
heaven
all
this
had
an
air
of
blasphemy
that
shocked
the
sensibilities
of
foreigners
and
compelled
them
to
stand
aloof
or
to
support
the
manchus
the
native
authorities
were
permitted
to
engage
foreign
ships
and
seamen
to
operate
against
the
rebels
who
sustained
a
siege
in
nanking
almost
as
long
as
the
siege
of
troy
from
shanghai
suchau
and
other
cities
the
taipings
were
driven
out
by
the
aid
of
foreigners
chiefly
led
by
ward
and
gordon
the
former
an
american
the
latter
a
briton
general
ward
was
never
under
the
command
of
li
hung
chang
but
to
him
more
than
to
any
other
foreigner
belongs
the
honor
of
turning
the
tide
of
the
taiping
rebellion
a
soldier
of
fortune
he
offered
to
throw
his
sword
into
the
government
scale
if
it
were
paid
for
with
many
times
its
weight
in
gold
gathering
a
nondescript
force
of
various
nationalities
he
recaptured
the
city
of
sungkiang
and
followed
this
up
by
such
a
series
of
successes
that
his
little
troop
came
to
be
known
as
the
army
falling
before
the
walls
of
tseki
he
was
interred
with
pomp
at
the
scene
of
his
first
victory
where
a
temple
was
erected
to
his
memory
and
he
is
now
reckoned
among
the
joss
of
the
chinese
empire
his
force
was
taken
into
li
pay
general
gordon
the
same
who
fell
at
khartoum
acted
under
the
direction
of
li
hung
chang
and
his
chief
exploit
was
the
recovery
of
suchau
unable
to
resist
his
artillery
the
rebel
chiefs
offered
to
capitulate
they
were
assured
by
him
that
their
lives
would
be
spared
to
this
li
hung
chang
consented
and
the
stronghold
was
at
once
surrendered
regardless
of
his
plighted
faith
li
caused
the
five
leaders
to
be
beheaded
an
act
of
treachery
which
filled
gordon
with
such
fury
that
he
went
from
camp
to
camp
looking
for
li
determined
to
put
a
bullet
in
his
head
li
however
avoided
a
meeting
until
gordon
wrath
had
time
to
subside
and
that
treacherous
act
laid
the
foundation
of
his
future
fortunes
he
was
made
governor
of
the
province
and
for
forty
years
he
rose
in
power
and
influence
not
only
was
this
terrible
rebellion
which
laid
waste
the
fairest
provinces
a
sequel
to
the
first
war
with
england
it
was
prolonged
and
aggravated
by
a
second
war
which
broke
out
in
in
the
last
stronghold
of
the
rebels
was
recaptured
and
the
rebellion
finally
suppressed
after
twelve
years
of
dismal
carnage
in
bringing
about
this
result
no
names
are
more
conspicuous
than
those
of
li
hung
chang
and
general
gordon
whose
sobriquet
of
chinese
gordon
ever
afterwards
characterized
him
li
good
fortune
served
him
well
in
this
war
having
won
the
favor
of
the
court
he
was
in
command
of
the
forces
of
eastern
kiangsu
and
all
the
brilliant
successes
of
ward
and
gordon
were
credited
to
him
he
was
not
only
made
governor
of
the
province
but
also
created
an
earl
in
perpetuity

been

in

hugest
of
blunders
the
crimean

nor
was
the
alliance
a
less
blunder
on
this
occasion
napoleon
excuse
for
participation
was
the
murder
of
a
missionary
in
kwangsi
but
his
real
motive
was
a
desire
to
checkmate
great
britain
and
prevent
the
conquest
of
new
territory
in
the
opium
war
she
had
stopped
at
nanking
leaving
the
pride
of
china
unhumbled
and
the
state
of
relations
so
unstable
that
another
war
was
required
to
place
them
on
a
better
footing
england
with
unselfish
generosity
invited
the
of
russia
and
the
united

either
power
might
have
found
as
good
a
pretext
for
hostile
action
as
that
of
france
but
they
chose
to
maintain
an
attitude
of
neutrality
offering
only
such
moral
support
as
might
enable
them
to
gather
up
the
apples

had
the
effrontery
to
say
that

to
make

on
the
list
of
open
ports
because
as
he
said
foreign
powers
would
make
use
of
it
to
overawe
the
chinese
capital
just
as
if
overawing
was
not
a
matter
of
prime
necessity
he
hastened
away
to
india
to
aid
in
suppressing
the
sepoy
mutiny
eventually
becoming
viceroy
after
another
campaign
in
china
his
brother
sir
bruce
succeeded
him
as
minister
in
china
and
twelve
months
later
july
the
ministers
of
the
four
powers
were
again
at
the
mouth
of
the
peiho
on
their
way
to
peking
for
the
exchange
of
ratified
copies
of
the
several
treaties
the
united
states
minister
was
john
ward
a
son
of
georgia
and
the
chief
of
our
little
squadron
was
the
gallant
old
commodore
tatnall
we
were
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
the
demolished
forts
completely
rebuilt
and
frowning
defiance
we
were
told
by
officers
who
came
down
to
the
shore
that
no
vessel
would
be
allowed
to
pass
but
that
the
way
to
peking
was
open
to
us
peitang
a
small
port
to
the
north
to
this
ward
made
no
objection
but
the
british
who
had
so
recently
held
the
keys
of
the
capital
were
indignant
to
be
met
by
such
a
rebuff
they
steamed
ahead
between
the
forts
leaving
the
chinese
to
take
the
consequences
all
at
once
the
long
line
of
batteries
opened
fire
one
or
two
gunboats
were
sunk
two
or
three
were
stranded
a
storming
party
was
repulsed
and
admiral
hope
who
was
dangerously
wounded
begged
our
american
commodore
to
give
him
a
lift
by
towing
up
a
flotilla
of
barges
filled
with
a
reserve
force
blood
is
thicker
than
water
exclaimed
tatnall
in
tones
that
have
echoed
round
the
globe
and
ward
making
no
objection
he
threw
neutrality
to
the
winds
and
proceeded
to
tow
up
the
barges
our
little
steamer
was
commanded
by
lieutenant
barker
now
admiral
barker
of
the
new
york
navy
yard
even
this
failed
to
retrieve
the
day
the
tide
having
fallen
too
low
for
a
successful
landing
for
the
british
admiral
nothing
remained
but
to
withdraw
his
shattered
forces
and
prepare
for
another
campaign
for
the
united
states
minister
a
dazzling
prospect
now
presented
itself
that
of
intervening
to
prevent
the
renewal
of
war
from
peitang
we
proceeded
by
land
two
days
then
we
continued
our
voyage
for
five
days
by
boat
on
the
upper
peiho
at
peking
calling
on
the
genial
old
kweiliang
who
had
signed
the
treaty
in
ward
was
astonished
at
his
change
of
tone
you
wish
to
see
the
emperor
that
goes
as
a
matter
of
course
but
his
majesty
knows
you
helped
the
british
and
he
requires
that
you
go
on
your
knees
before
the
throne
in
token
of
repentance
tell
him
said
ward
to
me
that
i
go
on
my
knees
only
to
god
and
woman
is
not
the
emperor
the
same
as
god
replied
the
old
courtier
taking
no
notice
of
a
tribute
to
woman
that
was
unintelligible
to
an
oriental
mind
you
need
not
really
touch
the
ground
with
your
knees
he
continued
but
merely
make
a
show
of
kneeling
there
will
be
eunuchs
at
hand
to
lift
you
up
saying
kneel
do
kneel
the
eunuchs
as
ward
well
knew
would
be
more
likely
to
push
us
to
our
knees
than
to
lift
us
up
and
he
wisely
decided
to
decline
the
honor
of
an
audience
on
such
terms
displeased
by
his
obstinacy
the
emperor
ordered
him
to
quit
the
capital
without
delay
and
exchange
ratifications
at
the
a
report
was
long
current
in
peking
that
foreigners
have
no
joints
in
their
knees
hence
their
reluctance
to
kneel
thus
vanished
for
ward
the
alluring
prospect
of
winning
for
himself
and
his
country
the
beatitude
of
the
peacemaker
the
summer
of
saw
the
peiho
forts
taken
and
an
allied
force
of
thirty
thousand
men
advancing
on
peking
the
court
fled
to
tartary
and
the
summer
palace
was
laid
in
ashes
to
punish
the
violation
of
a
flag
of
truce
the
bearers
of
which
were
bound
hand
and
foot
and
left
to
perish
within
its
walls
for
three
days
the
smoke
of
its
burning
carried
by
a
northwest
wind
hung
like
a
pall
over
the
devoted
city
whose
inhabitants
were
so
terrified
that
they
opened
the
gates
half
an
hour
before
the
time
set
for
bombardment
no
soldiers
were
admitted
but
the
demands
of
the
allies
were
all
acceded
to
and
supplementary
treaties
signed
within
the
walls
by
lord
elgin
and
baron
gros
peking
was
opened
to
foreign
residence
the
french
succeeded
in
opening
the
whole
country
to
the
labors
of
missionaries
legations
were
established
at
the
capital
and
a
new
era
of
peace
and
prosperity
dawned
on
the
distracted
empire
vi
the
war
with
france
if
the
opening
of
peking
required
a
prolonged
struggle
it
was
followed
by
a
of
pacific
intercourse
china
had
at
her
helm
a
number
of
wise
statesmen
such
as
prince
kung
and
wensiang
the
inspectorate
of
customs
begun
under
lay
took
shape
under
the
skilful
management
of
sir
robert
hart
and
from
that
day
to
this
it
has
proved
to
be
a
fruitful
nursery
of
reforms
political
and
social
not
only
were
students
sent
abroad
for
education
at
the
instance
and
under
the
leadership
of
yung
wing
but
a
school
for
interpreters
was
opened
in
the
capital
which
through
the
influence
of
sir
robert
hart
was
expanded
into
the
imperial
college
on
his
nomination
the
present
writer
was
called
to
the
head
of
it
and
wensiang
proposed
to
convert
it
into
a
great
national
university
by
making
it
obligatory
on
the
members
of
the
hanlin
academy
the
emperor
forest
of
pencils
to
come
there
for
a
course
of
instruction
in
science
and
international
law
against
this
daring
innovation
wojin
a
manchu
tutor
of
the
emperor
protested
declaring
that
it
would
be
humiliating
to
china
to
have
her
choicest
scholars
sit
at
the
feet
of
foreign
professors
the
scheme
fell
through
but
before
many
years
the
emperor
himself
had
taken
up
the
study
of
the
english
language
and
two
of
our
students
were
selected
to
be
his
instructors
one
of
them
is
at
this
present
time
chinese
minister
at
the
court
of
james
several
of
our
students
have
had
diplomatic
missions
and
one
after
serving
as
minister
abroad
is
now
a
leading
member
of
the
board
of
foreign
affairs
in
peking
a
press
opened
in
connection
with
the
college
printed
numerous
on
international
law
political
economy
physics
and
mathematics
translated
by
the
president
professors
and
students
america
was
fortunate
in
the
choice
of
the
first
minister
whom
she
sent
to
reside
at
peking
this
was
anson
burlingame
who
after
doing
much
to
encourage
the
chinese
in
the
direction
of
progress
was
by
them
made
the
head
of
the
first
embassy
which
they
sent
to
foreign
nations
his
success
in
other
countries
was
largely
due
to
the
sympathy
with
which
he
had
been
received
in
the
united
states
by
secretary
seward
and
to
the
advice
and
recommendations
with
which
he
was
provided
by
that
great
statesman
so
deep
an
interest
did
seward
take
in
china
that
he
went
in
person
to
study
its
condition
before
the
close
of
his
career
in
his
visit
to
peking
he
was
accompanied
by
his
nephew
george
seward
who
was
united
states
consul
at
shanghai
the
latter
has
since
that
date
worthily
represented
our
country
as
minister
at
peking
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
in
that
high
position
he
ever
performed
an
international
service
equal
in
importance
to
one
performed
during
his
consulship
for
which
he
has
recently
received
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
in
laying
out
their
new
concession
at
shanghai
the
french
had
excited
the
hostility
of
the
people
by
digging
up
and
levelling
down
many
of
those
graves
that
occupied
so
much
space
outside
of
the
city
walls
and
where
the
chinese
who
worshipped
their
ancestors
were
to
be
seen
every
day
burning
paper
and
heaping
up
the
earth
a
furious
mob
fell
on
the
french
police
chased
them
from
the
field
and
menaced
the
french
settlement
with
knife
and
firebrand
the
consuls
were
appealed
to
for
aid
but
no
one
responded
except
seward
who
headed
a
strong
force
from
one
of
our
dispersed
the
mob
and
secured
the
safety
of
the
foreign
settlement
but
for
his
timely
intervention
who
knows
that
the
french
consulate
would
not
have
been
reduced
to
ashes
if
the
consulate
had
been
burned
down
a
war
would
have
been
inevitable
with
a
chain
of
consequences
that
baffles
the
imagination
in
a
horrid
atrocity
was
perpetrated
by
chinese
at
tientsin
which
certainly
would
have
led
to
war
with
france
if
napoleon
iii
had
not
at
that
very
time
been
engaged
in
mortal
combat
with
germany
the
populace
were
made
to
believe
that
the
sisters
at
the
french
hospital
had
been
seen
extracting
the
eyeballs
from
their
patients
to
use
in
the
manufacture
of
magical
drugs
they
were
set
upon
by
a
maddened
multitude
a
score
or
more
of
them
slaughtered
and
the
buildings
where
they
had
cared
for
the
sick
and
suffering
turned
to
a
heap
of
ruins
count
rocheschouart
instead
of
reserving
the
case
to
be
settled
at
a
later
day
thought
best
to
accept
from
the
chinese
government
an
apology
with
an
ample
sum
in
the
way
of
pecuniary
compensation
that
grewsome
superstition
has
led
to
bloodshed
in
more
than
one
part
of
china
in
the
summer
of
i
was
called
one
day
from
the
western
hills
to
the
or
foreign
office
on
business
of
great
urgency
on
arriving
i
was
informed
that
the
chinese
gunboats
in
the
river
min
had
been
sunk
by
the
french
the
day
before
that
they
had
also
destroyed
the
arsenal
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
this
said
the
secretary
means
war
and
we
desire
to
know
how
belonging
to
the
enemy
and
resident
in
our
country
are
to
be
treated
according
to
the
rules
of
international
law
while
i
was
copying
out
the
principles
and
precedents
bearing
on
the
subject
the
same
secretary
begged
me
to
hasten
my
report
because
said
he
the
grand
council
is
waiting
for
it
to
embody
in
an
imperial
decree
true
enough
the
next
day
a
decree
from
the
throne
announced
the
outbreak
of
war
but
it
added
that
belonging
to
the
enemy
would
not
be
molested
two
of
our
professors
were
frenchmen
and
they
were
both
permitted
to
continue
in
charge
of
their
classes
without
molestation
hostilities
were
brought
to
a
happy
conclusion
by
the
agency
of
sir
robert
hart
one
of
his
customs
cruisers
employed
in
the
service
having
been
seized
by
the
french
campbell
was
sent
to
paris
to
see
the
french
president
and
petition
for
its
release
learning
that
president
grévy
would
welcome
the
restoration
of
peace
and
ascertaining
what
conditions
would
be
acceptable
sir
robert
laid
them
before
the
chinese
government
putting
an
end
to
a
conflict
which
if
suffered
to
go
on
might
have
ruined
the
interests
of
more
than
one
country
in
this
war
and
in
those
peace
negotiations
the
conduct
of
the
chinese
was
worthy
of
a
civilized
nation
yet
the
result
of
their
experience
was
to
make
them
more
ready
to
appeal
to
arms
in
cases
of
difficulty
li
connection
with
this
war
was
very
real
though
not
conspicuous
changpeilun
director
of
the
arsenal
at
foochow
was
his
not
only
was
li
disposed
to
aid
him
in
taking
revenge
he
was
himself
building
a
great
arsenal
in
the
north
and
it
was
no
doubt
owing
to
efficient
succor
from
this
quarter
that
formosa
was
able
to
hold
out
against
the
forces
of
the
french
vii
war
with
japan
both
in
its
inception
and
in
its
tragic
ending
the
notable
conflict
with
japan
connects
itself
with
the
name
of
li
hung
chang
the
island
empire
on
the
east
had
long
been
known
to
the
chinese
though
until
our
times
no
regular
intercourse
subsisted
between
the
two
countries
it
is
recorded
that
a
fleet
freighted
with
youth
and
maidens
was
despatched
thither
by
the
builder
of
the
great
wall
to
seek
in
those
islands
of
the
blest
for
the
herb
of
immortality
but
none
of
them
returned
it
was
to
be
a
colony
and
the
flowery
robe
by
which
its
object
is
veiled
is
not
sufficient
to
hide
the
real
aim
of
that
ambitious
potentate
yet
through
that
expedition
and
subsequent
emigrations
a
pacific
conquest
was
effected
which
does
honor
to
both
nations
planting
in
those
islands
the
learning
of
china
and
blending
with
their
native
traditions
the
essential
teachings
of
her
ancient
sages
for
centuries
prior
to
our
age
of
treaties
had
been
enforced
on
both
sides
the
japanese
confining
their
chinese
neighbors
as
they
did
the
dutch
to
a
little
islet
in
the
port
of
nagasaki
and
china
seeing
nothing
of
japan
except
an
occasional
descent
of
japanese
pirates
on
her
exposed
to
america
belongs
the
honor
of
opening
that
opulent
archipelago
to
the
commerce
of
the
world
our
shipwrecked
sailors
having
been
harshly
treated
by
those
islanders
a
squadron
was
sent
under
commodore
perry
to
yeddo
now
tokio
in
to
punish
them
if
necessary
and
to
provide
against
future
outrages
with
rare
moderation
he
merely
handed
in
a
statement
of
his
terms
and
sailed
away
to
loochoo
to
give
them
time
for
reflection
returning
six
months
later
instead
of
the
glove
of
combat
he
was
received
with
the
hand
of
friendship
and
a
treaty
was
signed
which
provided
for
the
opening
of
three
ports
and
the
residence
of
an
american
chargé
in
the
autumn
of
it
was
my
privilege
to
visit
yeddo
in
company
with
ward
and
commodore
tatnall
we
were
entertained
by
townsend
harris
and
shown
the
sights
of
the
city
of
the
shoguns
when
it
was
still
clothed
in
its
mediaeval
costume
the
long
of
the
natives
had
a
aspect
and
the
abject
servility
with
which
their
todzies
interpreters
prostrated
themselves
before
their
officers
excited
a
feeling
of
contempt
like
the
mayors
of
the
palace
in
mediaeval
france
the
shoguns
or
generals
had
relegated
the
mikado
to
a
single
city
of
the
interior
while
for
six
hundred
years
they
had
usurped
the
power
of
the
empire
practically
presenting
the
spectacle
of
two
emperors
one
spiritual
or
nominal
one
temporal
or
real
little
did
we
imagine
that
within
five
years
the
shoguns
would
be
swept
away
and
the
mikado
restored
to
more
than
his
ancient
power
the
conflagration
was
kindled
by
a
spark
from
our
engines
the
feudal
nobles
of
whom
there
were
four
hundred
and
fifty
each
a
prince
within
his
own
narrow
limits
were
indignant
that
the
shogun
had
opened
his
ports
to
those
aggressive
foreigners
of
the
west
raising
a
cry
of
kill
the
foreigners
they
overturned
the
shoguns
and
restored
the
mikado
their
fury
however
subsided
when
they
found
that
the
foreigner
was
too
strong
to
be
expelled
a
few
more
years
saw
them
patriotically
surrendering
their
feudal
powers
in
order
to
make
the
central
government
strong
enough
to
face
the
world
about
the
same
time
our
western
costume
was
adopted
and
along
with
it
the
parliamentary
system
of
great
britain
and
the
school
system
of
america
some
foreigners
were
shallow
enough
to
laugh
at
them
when
they
saw
those
little
soldiers
in
western
uniform
and
the
chinese
despised
them
more
than
ever
for
abandoning
the
dress
of
their
forefathers
to
protect
themselves
at
once
against
china
and
russia
the
japanese
felt
that
the
independence
of
corea
was
to
them
indispensable
the
king
had
been
a
feudal
subject
to
china
since
the
days
of
king
solomon
and
when
at
the
instance
of
japan
he
assumed
the
title
of
emperor
the
chinese
resolved
to
punish
him
for
such
insolence
this
was
in
the
japanese
took
up
arms
in
his
defence
and
though
they
had
some
hard
fighting
they
soon
made
it
evident
that
nothing
but
a
treaty
of
peace
could
keep
them
out
of
peking
li
hung
chang
who
had
long
been
viceroy
at
tientsin
and
who
had
built
a
northern
arsenal
and
remodelled
the
chinese
army
had
to
confess
himself
beaten
for
him
it
was
a
bitter
pill
to
be
sent
as
a
suppliant
to
the
court
of
the
mikado
that
china
was
beaten
was
not
his
fault
yet
he
was
held
responsible
by
his
own
government
and
departed
on
that
humiliating
mission
as
if
with
a
rope
about
his
neck
fortunately
for
him
during
his
mission
in
japan
an
assassin
lodged
a
bullet
in
his
head
and
the
desire
of
japan
to
undo
the
effect
of
that
shameful
act
made
negotiation
an
easy
task
converting
his
defeat
into
a
sort
of
triumph
happily
too
he
enjoyed
the
counsel
and
assistance
of
foster
formerly
united
states
secretary
of
state
formosa
one
of
the
brightest
jewels
in
the
chinese
crown
had
to
be
handed
over
to
japan
and
lower
manchuria
would
have
gone
with
it
had
not
russia
supported
by
austria
and
germany
compelled
the
japanese
to
withdraw
their
claims
the
next
turn
of
the
kaleidoscope
shows
us
china
seeking
to
follow
the
example
of
japan
in
throwing
off
the
trammels
of
antiquated
usage
in
when
the
tide
of
reform
was
in
full
swing
the
marquis
ito
of
japan
paid
a
visit
to
peking
and
as
president
of
the
university
i
had
the
honor
of
being
asked
to
meet
him
along
with
li
hung
chang
at
a
dinner
given
by
huyufen
mayor
of
the
city
and
the
grand
secretary
sunkianai
it
was
a
lesson
intended
for
them
when
he
told
us
how
on
his
returning
from
england
in
the
old
feudal
days
his
prince
asked
him
if
anything
needed
to
be
reformed
in
japan
everything
he
replied
the
lesson
was
lost
on
the
three
chinese
statesmen
progressive
though
they
were
for
china
was
then
on
the
eve
of
a
violent
reaction
which
threatened
ruin
instead
of
progress
viii
war
with
the
world
the
last
summer
of
the
century
saw
the
forts
at
the
mouth
of
the
peiho
captured
for
the
third
time
since
the
beginning
of
it
was
the
opening
scene
in
the
last
act
of
a
long
drama
and
more
imposing
than
any
that
had
gone
before
not
in
the
number
of
assailants
nor
in
the
obstinacy
of
resistance
but
in
the
fact
that
instead
of
one
or
two
nations
as
hitherto
all
the
powers
of
the
modern
world
were
now
combined
to
batter
down
the
barriers
of
chinese
conservatism
getting
possession
of
tientsin
not
without
hard
fighting
they
advanced
on
peking
under
eight
national
flags
against
the
eight
banners
of
the
manchu
tribes
what
was
the
mainspring
of
this
tragic
movement
what
unforeseen
occurrence
had
effected
a
union
of
powers
whose
usual
attitude
is
mutual
jealousy
or
secret
hostility
in
a
word
it
was
spurning
petty
questions
of
policy
they
combined
their
forces
to
extinguish
a
conflagration
kindled
by
pride
and
superstition
which
menaced
the
lives
of
all
foreigners
in
north
china
in
when
the
emperor
had
entered
on
a
career
of
progress
the
empress
dowager
was
appealed
to
by
a
number
of
her
old
servants
to
save
the
empire
from
a
young
phaeton
who
was
driving
so
fast
as
to
be
in
danger
of
setting
the
world
on
fire
coming
out
of
her
luxurious
retreat
ten
miles
from
the
city
where
she
had
never
ceased
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
course
of
affairs
she
again
took
possession
of
the
throne
and
compelled
her
adopted
son
to
ask
her
to
teach
him
how
to
govern
this
was
the
in
her
earlier
years
she
had
not
been
opposed
to
progress
but
now
that
she
had
returned
to
power
at
the
instance
of
a
conservative
party
she
entered
upon
a
course
of
reaction
which
made
a
collision
with
foreign
powers
all
but
inevitable
she
had
been
justly
provoked
by
their
repeated
aggressions
germany
had
seized
a
port
in
shantung
in
consequence
of
the
murder
of
two
missionaries
russia
at
once
clapped
her
bear
paw
on
port
arthur
great
britain
set
the
lion
foot
on
weihaiwei
and
france
demanded
kwang
chan
bay
all
to
maintain
the
balance
of
power
exasperated
beyond
endurance
the
empress
gave
notice
that
any
further
demands
of
the
sort
would
be
met
by
force
of
arms
the
governor
of
shantung
appointed
by
her
was
a
manchu
by
the
name
of
yuhien
who
more
than
any
other
man
is
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
he
it
was
who
called
the
boxers
from
their
and
supplied
them
with
arms
convinced
apparently
of
the
reality
of
their
claim
to
be
invulnerable
for
a
hundred
years
they
had
existed
as
a
secret
society
under
a
ban
of
prohibition
now
however
they
had
made
amends
by
killing
german
missionaries
and
he
hoped
by
their
aid
to
expel
the
germans
from
shantung
on
complaint
of
the
german
minister
he
was
recalled
but
decorated
by
the
hands
of
the
empress
dowager
he
was
transferred
to
shansi
where
later
on
he
slaughtered
all
the
missionaries
in
that
province
in
shantung
he
was
succeeded
by
yuen
shikai
a
statesmanlike
official
who
soon
compelled
the
boxers
to
seek
another
arena
for
their
operations
instead
of
creeping
back
to
their
original
they
crossed
the
boundary
and
directed
their
march
toward
peking
on
the
way
not
merely
laying
waste
the
villages
of
native
christians
but
tearing
up
the
railway
and
killing
foreigners
indiscriminately
they
had
made
a
convert
of
prince
tuan
father
of
the
heir
apparent
he
it
was
who
encouraged
their
advance
believing
that
he
might
make
use
of
them
to
help
his
son
to
the
throne
their
numbers
were
swelled
by
multitudes
who
fancied
that
they
would
suffer
irreparable
personal
loss
through
the
introduction
of
railways
and
modern
machinery
and
china
can
charge
the
losses
of
the
last
war
to
those
misguided
crowds
fortunately
several
companies
of
marines
amounting
to
four
hundred
and
fifty
men
arrived
in
peking
the
day
before
the
destruction
of
the
track
the
legations
were
threatened
churches
were
burnt
down
native
christians
put
to
death
and
fires
set
to
numerous
shops
simply
because
they
contained
foreign
goods
then
it
was
that
the
foreign
admirals
captured
the
forts
in
order
to
bring
relief
to
our
foreign
community
that
step
the
chinese
foreign
office
pronounced
an
act
of
war
and
ordered
the
legations
and
all
other
foreigners
to
quit
the
capital
the
ministers
remonstrated
knowing
that
on
the
way
we
could
not
escape
being
butchered
by
boxers
on
the
of
june
the
german
minister
was
killed
on
his
way
to
the
foreign
office
the
legations
and
other
foreigners
at
once
took
refuge
in
the
british
legation
previously
agreed
on
as
the
best
place
to
make
a
defence
professor
james
was
killed
while
crossing
a
bridge
near
the
legation
that
night
we
were
fired
on
from
all
sides
and
for
eight
weeks
we
were
exposed
to
a
daily
fusillade
from
an
enemy
that
counted
more
on
reducing
us
by
starvation
than
on
carrying
our
defences
by
storm
about
midnight
on
august
we
heard
firing
at
the
gates
of
the
city
and
knew
that
our
deliverers
were
near
the
next
day
scaling
the
walls
or
battering
down
the
gates
they
forced
their
way
into
the
city
and
effected
our
rescue
the
day
following
the
roman
catholic
cathedral
was
relieved
the
defence
of
which
forms
the
brightest
page
in
the
history
of
the
siege
and
in
the
afternoon
we
held
a
solemn
service
of
thanksgiving
the
palaces
were
found
vacant
the
empress
dowager
having
fled
with
her
entire
court
she
was
the
same
empress
who
had
fled
from
the
british
and
french
forty
years
before
she
was
not
pursued
because
prince
ching
came
forward
to
meet
the
foreign
ministers
and
he
and
li
hung
chang
were
appointed
to
arrange
terms
of
peace
li
was
viceroy
at
canton
had
he
been
in
his
old
viceroyalty
at
tientsin
this
boxer
war
could
not
have
occurred
that
its
fury
was
limited
to
the
northern
belt
of
provinces
was
owing
to
the
wisdom
of
chang
and
liu
the
great
satraps
of
central
china
who
engaged
to
keep
their
provinces
in
order
if
not
attacked
by
foreigners
footnote
chang
is
regarded
as
the
ablest
of
china
viceroys
he
published
prior
to
the
a
notable
book
in
which
he
argues
that
china
only
hope
is
in
the
adoption
of
the
sciences
and
arts
of
the
west
i
called
on
the
old
statesman
in
the
summer
of
after
the
last
of
the
treaties
was
signed
he
seemed
to
feel
that
his
work
was
finished
but
he
still
had
energy
enough
to
write
a
preface
for
my
translation
of
hall
international
law
and
before
the
end
of
another
month
his
long
life
of
restless
activity
had
come
to
a
close
at
the
age
of
by
posthumous
decree
he
was
made
a
marquis
in
the
autumn
the
court
returned
to
peking
the
way
having
been
opened
by
li
negotiations
thanks
to
the
lessons
of
adversity
the
dowager
has
been
led
to
favor
the
cause
of
progress
not
only
has
she
the
educational
reforms
proposed
by
the
emperor
but
she
has
gone
a
step
farther
and
ordered
that
instead
of
mere
literary
finish
a
knowledge
of
arts
and
sciences
shall
be
required
in
examinations
for
the
civil
service
the
following
words
i
wrote
in
an
obituary
notice
a
few
days
after
death
for
over
twenty
years
earl
li
has
been
a
conspicuous
patron
of
educational
reform
the
university
and
other
schools
at
tientsin
were
founded
by
him
and
he
had
a
large
share
in
founding
the
imperial
university
in
peking
during
the
last
twenty
years
i
have
had
the
honor
of
being
on
intimate
terms
with
him
five
years
ago
he
wrote
a
preface
for
a
book
of
mine
on
christian
psychology
showing
a
freedom
from
prejudice
very
rare
among
chinese
officials
another
preface
which
he
wrote
for
me
is
noteworthy
from
the
fact
that
it
is
one
of
the
last
papers
that
came
from
his
prolific
pencil
having
finished
a
translation
of
international
law
begun
before
the
siege
i
showed
it
to
li
hung
chang
not
two
weeks
ago
the
old
man
took
a
deep
interest
in
it
and
returned
it
with
a
preface
in
which
he
says
am
now
near
eighty
martin
is
over
seventy
we
are
old
and
soon
to
pass
away
but
we
both
hope
that
coming
generations
will
be
guided
by
the
principles
of
this
book
with
all
his
faults
those
of
his
time
and
country
li
hung
chang
was
a
true
patriot
for
him
it
was
a
fitting
task
to
place
the
keystone
in
the
arch

commemorates

african
development
by
cyrus
adams
africa
is
the
most
ancient
and
the
most
recent
conquest
of
the
human
race
as
far
as
the
light
of
history
can
be
projected
into
the
past
we
see
egypt
among
the
first
and
foremost
on
the
threshold
of
civilization
the
continent
discovered
last
and
opened
last
to
the
enterprises
of
the
world
is
still
africa
why
is
it
that
we
see
there
both
the
dawn
of
civilization
and
the
tardiest
development
of
human
progress
the
reasons
are
not
far
to
seek
the
physical
conformation
of
no
other
continent
is
so
unfavorable
for
exploration
and
development
straight
affording
little
shelter
to
the
primitive
ships
of
early
mariners
repelled
the
enterprising
phoenicians
and
other
seafarers
in
their
eager
search
for
new
lands
worth
colonizing
nor
was
it
easy
for
explorers
to
penetrate
into
the
interior
in
its
surface
africa
has
been
compared
to
an
inverted
saucer
the
high
plateaus
occupying
most
of
the
interior
descending
to
the
sea
by
short
abrupt
and
steep
slopes
so
that
the
wide
and
peaceful
rivers
of
the
plateaus
are
lashed
into
foam
as
they
approach
the
ocean
by
many
series
of
rapids
and
cataracts
in
all
the
other
continents
rivers
have
been
the
lines
of
least
resistance
to
the
advance
of
man
civilization
has
developed
first
along
the
great
rivers
the
valleys
were
first
settled
and
up
these
valleys
man
carried
his
industries
and
commerce
far
inland
thus
the
euphrates
and
tigris
of
mesopotamia
the
ganges
and
indus
of
india
and
the
hoang
and
yangtse
of
china
were
the
creators
of
history
but
this
is
true
in
africa
only
of
the
nile
all
the
other
rivers
have
been
impediments
instead
of
helpful
factors
in
the
formidable
task
of
exploration
and
development
the
trying
climate
also
gave
africa
odious
repute
and
delayed
for
centuries
the
study
and
utilization
of
the
continent
when
the
british
expedition
under
captain
tuckey
attempted
to
ascend
the
congo
in
to
see
if
it
were
really
the
lower
part
of
the
niger
river
as
had
been
conjectured
nearly
all
of
its
members
perished
miserably
among
the
rapids
less
than
two
hundred
miles
from
the
sea
such
tragedies
as
this
paralyzed
enterprise
in
africa
until
white
men
learned
that
the
climate
was
not
so
deadly
after
all
if
they
adhered
to
the
manner
of
life
the
hygienic
rules
that
should
be
observed
in
that
tropical
expanse
in
all
the
other
continents
also
explorers
have
had
the
advantage
of
domestic
animals
to
carry
their
food
and
camp
equipment
but
in
large
parts
of
tropical
africa
the
horse
ox
and
mule
can
not
live
the
bite
of
the
little
tsetse
fly
kills
them
its
sting
is
hardly
so
annoying
as
that
of
the
mosquito
but
near
the
base
of
its
proboscis
is
a
little
bag
containing
the
fatal
poison
camels
have
been
loaded
near
zanzibar
for
the
journey
to
tanganyika
but
they
did
not
live
to
reach
the
great
lake
the
ship
of
the
desert
can
never
be
utilized
in
the
humid
regions
of
tropical
africa
the
elephant
is
found
from
sea
to
sea
but
he
has
not
proved
to
be
so
amenable
to
domestication
as
his
asian
brother
he
may
yet
be
reduced
to
useful
servitude
the
efforts
in
this
direction
in
the
german
and
french
colonies
are
somewhat
encouraging
though
in
only
six
elephants
had
thus
far
been
broken
to
work
and
were
daily
used
as
beasts
of
burden
explorers
of
tropical
africa
have
always
been
compelled
to
rely
upon
human
porterage
the
most
expensive
and
unsatisfactory
form
of
transportation
with
the
result
that
nearly
all
the
great
lines
of
exploration
have
been
extended
through
the
continent
at
enormous
cost
so
most
other
parts
of
the
world
were
occupied
colonized
civilized
before
africa
was
explored
a
continent
larger
than
our
own
was
for
centuries
neglected
and
despised
nothing
good
can
come
out
of
africa
became
proverbial
seventy
years
ago
africa
away
from
the
coasts
and
the
nile
was
almost
a
blank
upon
our
maps
save
for
fanciful
details
that
are
ludicrously
grotesque
in
the
light
of
our
present
knowledge
then
dawned
the
era
of
david
livingstone
years
ago
this
humble
scotchman
went
to
south
africa
as
a
missionary
it
was
not
long
before
he
became
imbued
with
the
idea
that
missionary
service
could
not
be
projected
on
broad
economic
and
effective
lines
till
the
field
was
known
the
explorer
he
said
must
precede
the
teacher
and
the
merchant
we
can
work
best
for
christianity
and
civilization
after
we
learn
what
the
people
are
and
know
the
nature
of
their
environment
this
was
the
thought
that
took
him
into
the
unknown
that
inspired
him
with
unflagging
courage
and
zeal
throughout
twenty
years
of
weary
plodding
in
the
african
wilderness
among
hundreds
of
tribes
who
never
before
had
seen
a
white
man
and
all
the
years
he
was
studying
the
country
and
winning
the
love
of
its
people
his
faith
in
africa
in
its
abounding
resources
worth
the
world
seeking
in
the
capacity
of
its
people
for
development
steadily
grew
till
it
became
the
impulse
of
his
life
livingstone
faith
converted
the
world
to
the
belief
that
after
all
there
was
good
in
africa
i
shall
never
forget
said
stanley
one
day
in
new
york
the
time
when
i
stood
with
livingstone
on
the
shore
of
lake
tanganyika
and
he
raised
his
trembling
hand
above
his
head
leaned
towards
me
as
he
looked
me
in
the
eye
and
said
in
a
voice
broken
with
emotion
day
is
coming
when
the
whole
world
will
know
that
africa
is
worth
reclaiming
and
that
its
people
may
be
brought
out
of
barbarism
the
world
needs
africa
and
teachers
merchants
railroads
and
every
influence
of
civilization
will
be
spread
through
this
continent
to
fit
it
for
the
place
in
human
interests
that
belongs
to
it
i
thought
then
that
livingstone
was
an
enthusiast
and
a
visionary
but
long
ago
i
learned
to
believe
that
every
word
he
said
was
true
europe
and
america
were
thrilled
by
the
simple
narrative
of
those
thousand
miles
of
wanderings
that
brought
into
the
light
of
day
millions
of
human
beings
who
had
been
as
much
unknown
to
us
as
though
they
inhabited
mars
livingstone
did
not
live
to
know
it
but
it
was
he
who
kindled
the
great
african
movement
an
outburst
of
zeal
for
geographic
discovery
and
economic
development
such
as
was
never
seen
before
thirteen
years
ago
a
frenchman
named
de
bissy
completed
the
largest
map
yet
made
of
africa
in
the
preparation
of
this
great
work
which
occupied
much
of
his
time
for
eight
years
he
used
as
his
sources
of
information
nearly
eighteen
hundred
route
and
other
maps
nearly
all
of
which
were
the
result
of
the
work
of
explorers
in
the
preceding
quarter
of
a
century
all
that
we
know
of
the
geography
of
over
of
africa
is
the
work
of
the
past
since
livingstone
made
his
first
journey
in
and
we
know
far
more
of
inner
africa
than
was
known
of
inner
north
america
three
hundred
years
after
columbus
discovered
the
western
world
a
little
over
a
century
ago
our
were
reading
in
their
school
geographies
that
north
america
had
no
conspicuous
mountains
except
the
alleghanies
and
these
mountains
and
the
andes
of
south
america
were
believed
to
be
one
and
the
same
chain
interrupted
by
the
gulf
of
mexico
many
men
not
yet
bent
with
years
can
remember
when
the
interior
of
africa
was
a
white
space
on
the
maps
but
it
is
not
possible
to
make
such
a
geographical
blunder
as
we
have
mentioned
about
any
part
of
africa
it
is
because
of
the
work
he
did
in
those
twenty
years
sowing
all
the
while
the
seeds
from
which
sprang
the
great
african
movement
that
the
gentle
master
of
african
exploration
is
acclaimed
as
one
of
the
world
great
men
and
that
his
body
rests
in
westminster
abbey
among
the
illustrious
dead
of
britain
the
son
of
a
worthy
weaver
in
blantyre
scotland
livingstone
early
life
was
that
of
a
poor
boy
working
in
a
quiet
sober
affectionate
and
faithful
in
every
relation
of
life
moved
at
last
by
the
thirst
for
knowledge
that
has
distinguished
many
a
humble
scotch
boy
he
entered
the
university
at
glasgow
studying
during
the
winter
months
and
spending
the
summers
at
his
trade
in
the
factory
fitting
himself
all
the
while
for
the
conquests
he
little
dreamed
he
was
to
achieve
over
difficulties
almost
insurmountable
a
classmate
spoke
of
him
as
a
pale
thin
retiring
young
man
but
frank
and
most
ready
for
any
good
and
useful
work
even
for
chopping
the
university
fuel
and
grinding
wheat
for
the
bread
in
when
he
was
years
old
he
went
to
london
to
be
examined
as
a
candidate
for
the
african
missionary
service
two
years
later
he
was
sent
to
south
africa
where
for
eight
or
nine
years
he
labored
among
the
natives
earnestly
and
unostentatiously
north
of
the
place
now
famous
as
the
site
of
the
kimberley
diamond
mines
it
was
here
that
he
became
intimately
acquainted
with
the
celebrated
missionary
robert
moffatt
whose
daughter
he
married
his
devoted
wife
accompanied
him
in
some
of
his
later
travels
but
long
before
he
finished
his
work
her
body
was
laid
to
rest
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
that
for
years
was
pointed
out
to
all
visitors
to
the
lower
zambesi
in
began
the
series
of
explorations
that
continued
till
his
death
the
end
of
geographical
discovery
is
the
beginning
of
missionary
enterprise
he
wrote
burning
with
zeal
to
reveal
africa
to
the
world
livingstone
never
forgot
the
main
aim
of
his
life
to
open
ways
for
the
planting
of
mission
stations
among
all
the
scores
of
tribes
he
visited
i
hope
god
will
in
mercy
permit
me
to
establish
the
gospel
somewhere
in
this
region
he
wrote
from
the
land
of
the
barotse
on
the
upper
zambesi
does
he
now
look
down
from
his
eternal
home
upon
that
very
land
whose
churches
and
schools
are
the
fruition
of
the
labors
of
french
protestants
whose
king
in
london
to
attend
the
coronation
of
edward
said
he
wanted
more
teachers
and
more
men
to
train
his
people
to
build
houses
and
work
iron
he
prayed
that
he
might
live
to
see
the
double
influence
of
the
spirit
of
commerce
and
christianity
employed
to
stay
the
bitter
fountain
of
african
misery
the
glowing
zeal
of
the
christian
philanthropist
and
the
untiring
ardor
of
the
born
explorer
were
perfectly
blended
in
the
spirit
of
the
great
pioneer
of
modern
african
discovery
livingstone
routes
through
africa
would
extend
about
seven
times
between
new
york
city
and
san
francisco
and
in
his
almost
endless
marches
over
plain
through
jungle
across
mountains
and
wide
rivers
the
natives
met
him
almost
without
exception
in
a
generous
and
hospitable
spirit
love
was
the
secret
of
his
success
he
won
his
way
by
kindness
give
the
barbarous
african
time
to
see
that
you
wish
him
well
that
you
would
do
him
good
in
ways
he
knows
are
helpful
and
his
affection
is
evoked
it
was
said
that
the
british
could
never
establish
their
rule
over
the
great
wabemba
tribe
southwest
of
tanganyika
without
a
military
campaign
in
two
humble
catholic
fathers
entered
lobemba
walked
straight
to
the
chief
town
and
were
told
that
if
they
did
not
leave
the
country
in
one
day
they
would
be
killed
as
the
stern
message
was
delivered
they
saw
an
old
woman
on
the
ground
in
great
pain
from
a
severe
wound
the
news
soon
spread
that
these
unwelcome
strangers
had
washed
and
dressed
the
wound
and
made
the
old
woman
comfortable
these
people
love
men
was
the
word
that
passed
from
lip
to
lip
as
the
sick
and
suffering
came
out
from
the
town
to
be
treated
while
thousands
of
natives
looked
on
at
nightfall
the
white
men
were
told
they
might
remain
another
day
they
ministered
for
eleven
days
to
those
who
needed
help
and
were
then
invited
to
remain
the
rest
of
their
lives
the
mission
stations
of
the
white
fathers
are
scattered
all
over
lobemba
the
country
is
open
in
every
corner
to
the
whites
and
in
british
rule
was
established
the
victory
was
won
not
with
guns
but
by
gentle
helpful
kindness
livingstone
never
believed
that
the
sympathies
of
our
common
humanity
are
extinct
even
in
the
bosom
of
a
savage
enfolded
in
the
panoply
of
christian
kindness
he
passed
unscathed
among
the
most
warlike
tribes
no
memory
of
wrong
or
pain
rankled
in
the
heart
of
any
man
woman
or
child
he
ever
met
he
is
known
as
the
good
old
man
wherever
his
path
led
him
in
those
twenty
years
when
explorers
began
to
study
the
healthful
highlands
of
the
akikuyu
tribe
in
east
africa
a
few
years
ago
the
natives
rushed
to
arms
keep
away
from
us
they
said
one
of
your
white
men
came
through
the
land
stealing
food
from
our
gardens
and
killing
all
who
said
he
ought
to
pay
us
for
our
vegetables
we
want
nothing
to
do
with
thieves
and
murderers
like
you
but
no
vengeance
fell
on
the
head
of
any
white
traveller
who
ever
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
livingstone
those
explorers
have
achieved
most
who
adhered
to
his
example
of
unfailing
kindness
mercy
and
justice
the
brutal
german
whose
crimes
made
the
akikuyu
hostile
to
all
whites
marked
his
path
with
blood
from
the
indian
ocean
to
victoria
nyanza
serpa
pinto
renowned
for
the
scientific
value
of
his
work
aroused
condemnation
and
disgust
because
he
fought
his
way
through
many
tribes
among
whom
livingstone
and
arnot
had
wandered
almost
alone
and
in
perfect
safety
fortunately
there
have
not
been
many
explorers
militant
the
brilliant
discoveries
of
grenfell
delcommune
lemaire
and
others
who
are
in
the
first
rank
of
african
pioneers
were
made
without
harming
a
native
let
us
glance
at
a
few
of
livingstone
discoveries
and
form
our
own
conclusions
as
to
whether
his
sublime
faith
in
the
future
of
africa
has
thus
far
been
justified
by
events
in
the
depths
of
the
wilderness
he
discovered
the
large
lake
mweru
through
which
the
upper
congo
flows
though
white
influences
have
reached
that
remote
region
only
within
the
past
two
or
three
years
a
little
steamboat
now
plies
those
waters
a
photograph
of
mpweto
one
of
the
white
settlements
on
the
lake
shows
the
commodious
quarters
of
the
europeans
two
long
lines
of
cabins
in
which
the
native
workmen
live
and
gardens
extending
for
a
along
the
shore
livingstone
brought
to
light
the
coal
fields
of
the
zambesi
the
only
coal
yet
known
in
tropical
africa
while
these
lines
are
being
written
the
british
of
rhodesia
are
preparing
to
open
mines
along
these
deposits
he
told
the
world
of
the
victoria
falls
of
the
zambesi
the
largest
known
a
mile
wide
and
twice
as
high
as
niagara
the
installation
of
an
electrical
plant
at
this
great
source
of
power
is
now
in
progress
and
it
is
hoped
within
three
years
to
transmit
electrically
all
the
power
required
to
work
the
large
copper
mines
in
the
north
the
coal
fields
in
the
east
and
to
move
trains
on
the
cape
to
cairo
railroad
for
a
distance
of
three
hundred
miles
the
recent
improvements
in
transmission
of
power
encourages
the
belief
that
the
victoria
falls
may
some
day
possess
large
industrial
utility
for
a
wide
region
around
them
coffee
plantations
on
the
hills
overlooking
the
long
expanse
of
nyassa
the
splendid
freshwater
sea
which
livingstone
revealed
in
its
setting
of
mountains
are
selling
their
superior
product
in
london
at
a
high
price
the
town
of
blantyre
among
the
nyassa
highlands
which
livingstone
first
described
has
a
newspaper
telegraphic
and
cable
communication
with
all
the
world
and
industrial
schools
in
which
the
manual
arts
are
taught
to
hundreds
of
natives
here
is
the
large
brick
church
now
famous
built
by
native
craftsmen
who
before
livingstone
time
had
never
seen
a
white
man
and
lived
in
a
state
of
barbarism
an
edifice
that
would
adorn
the
suburbs
of
any
american
city
and
of
which
the
explorer
joseph
thomson
said
it
is
the
most
wonderful
sight
i
have
seen
in
africa
the
natives
made
the
brick
burned
the
lime
sawed
and
hewed
the
timbers
and
erected
the
building
to
the
driving
of
the
last
nail
they
had
the
capacity
and
it
was
evoked
by
the
genius
of
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
africa
missionary
scott
of
blantyre
steamboats
are
afloat
on
five
of
the
six
important
seas
of
the
great
lake
region
of
central
africa
on
two
of
the
three
which
livingstone
discovered
only
a
beginning
has
been
made
for
the
field
stretches
from
ocean
to
ocean
but
the
man
who
in
the
year
of
livingstone
death
should
have
predicted
of
the
achievement
of
the
present
generation
would
have
been
laughed
at
as
a
visionary
even
the
surface
of
africa
is
changing
and
the
truth
of
livingstone
is
not
always
the
truth
of
in
his
first
journey
in
which
he
braved
the
perils
of
the
south
african
thirst
lands
he
reached
the
broad
and
placid
expanse
of
lake
ngami
covering
an
area
of
three
hundred
square
miles
in
the
gradual
desiccation
of
that
region
the
lake
has
now
entirely
disappeared
its
place
is
wholly
occupied
by
a
partly
marshy
plain
covered
with
reeds
and
no
vestige
of
water
surface
is
to
be
seen
he
found
the
little
lake
dilolo
so
exactly
balanced
on
a
flat
plain
between
two
great
river
systems
that
one
stream
from
the
lake
flowed
north
to
the
congo
and
another
south
to
the
zambesi
but
for
years
past
there
has
been
no
connection
between
the
lake
and
the
congo
he
sought
in
vain
like
many
explorers
after
him
for
the
outlet
to
lake
tanganyika
the
mystery
was
not
solved
till
more
than
twenty
years
after
burton
discovered
the
lake
the
solution
came
when
the
explorer
thomson
and
missionary
hore
found
the
waters
of
tanganyika
pouring
in
a
perfect
torrent
down
the
valley
of
the
lukuga
to
the
congo
the
explanation
of
the
strange
phenomenon
is
that
for
a
series
of
years
the
evaporation
exceeds
the
water
receipts
the
level
of
the
lake
steadily
falls
and
the
valley
of
the
lukuga
becomes
choked
with
grass
then
a
period
follows
when
the
water
receipts
exceed
the
evaporation
and
the
waters
rise
burst
through
the
barriers
of
vegetation
in
the
lukuga
and
are
carried
to
the
congo
once
more
it
was
his
second
and
third
journeys
that
established
livingstone
fame
as
a
great
explorer
in
those
journeys
his
routes
were
from
the
upper
zambesi
to
loanda
in
portuguese
west
africa
and
then
from
loanda
to
the
mouth
of
the
zambesi
nearly
twelve
thousand
miles
of
travel
the
third
journey
was
the
first
crossing
of
the
continent
and
while
traversing
the
wide
savannas
of
the
uplands
and
revealing
the
zambesi
the
fourth
largest
river
of
africa
from
source
to
delta
he
was
able
to
verify
one
of
the
most
brilliant
generalizations
ever
made
by
a
geologist
sir
roderick
murchison
president
of
the
royal
geographical
society
in
deducing
his
conclusions
from
the
very
fragmentary
and
imperfect
knowledge
of
africa
then
extant
evolved
his
striking
hypothesis
as
to
the
physical
conformation
of
the
continent
which
has
been
briefly
mentioned
above
and
is
the
accepted
fact
of
livingstone
was
able
to
prove
the
accuracy
of
this
hypothesis
and
he
dedicated
his
missionary
travels
to
its
distinguished
author
the
makalolo
chief
sekeletu
on
the
zambesi
river
supplied
livingstone
with
men
ivory
and
trading
commissions
that
helped
the
humble
and
unknown
white
man
lacking
all
financial
resources
except
his
slender
salary
to
make
the
two
great
journeys
which
kindled
the
interest
and
led
to
the
wonderful
achievements
of
our
generation
in
this
noteworthy
incident
we
see
the
human
agencies
through
which
africa
will
attain
the
full
stature
allotted
to
her
the
caucasian
and
the
negro
each
has
his
onerous
part
in
the
work
of
bringing
the
civilized
world
and
africa
into
touch
and
accord
when
livingstone
went
home
after
his
third
journey
his
crowded
to
see
and
hear
the
explorer
who
had
added
more
facts
to
geographical
knowledge
than
any
other
man
of
his
time
they
saw
a
person
of
middle
age
plainly
and
rather
carelessly
dressed
whose
and
face
indicated
a
man
of
quick
and
keen
discernment
strong
impulses
inflexible
resolution
and
habitual
they
heard
a
speaker
whose
command
of
his
mother
tongue
was
imperfect
and
who
apologized
for
his
broken
hesitating
speech
by
saying
that
he
had
not
spoken
the
english
language
for
nearly
sixteen
years
in
no
public
place
did
he
ever
allude
to
his
personal
sufferings
though
fever
had
brought
him
to
death
door
and
the
years
had
been
crowded
with
the
most
harrowing
cares
the
work
he
had
done
and
would
carry
on
to
the
end
the
new
africa
he
alone
could
describe
the
faith
that
had
grown
and
strengthened
in
every
week
of
his
long
pilgrimage
that
the
world
needed
africa
its
resources
and
peoples
were
the
burden
of
every
utterance
the
great
london
meeting
where
he
first
appeared
took
practical
measures
to
support
him
in
the
work
he
had
begun
unaided
and
one
of
the
resolutions
adopted
declaring
that
the
important
discoveries
of
livingstone
will
tend
hereafter
greatly
to
advance
the
interest
of
civilization
commerce
and
freedom
among
the
numerous
tribes
and
nations
of
that
vast
continent
was
prophetic
of
all
the
best
fruits
of
the
colossal
work
that
has
been
done
to
the
present
time
during
his
two
years
at
home
livingstone
wrote
his
missionary
travels
he
returned
to
england
once
more
when
he
published
a
narrative
of
an
expedition
to
the
zambesi
and
in
went
back
to
africa
to
resume
the
explorations
which
ended
only
with
his
death
between
and
he
was
four
years
in
europe
and
twenty
years
in
the
field
eating
native
food
sleeping
in
straw
huts
in
one
of
which
he
died
lost
to
view
for
many
years
at
a
time
because
he
had
no
means
of
communication
with
the
coasts
it
was
this
fact
that
led
to
successful
search
for
livingstone
in
perhaps
no
other
explorer
ever
gave
so
many
years
to
continuous
in
this
respect
he
far
surpassed
the
record
of
any
other
of
the
african
pioneers
the
discoveries
in
his
last
journeys
covering
the
periods
from
to
and
from
to
were
as
brilliant
and
fruitful
as
his
earlier
work
but
not
so
astonishing
because
his
first
years
were
given
to
revealing
the
broader
aspects
of
africa
and
its
tribes
while
his
later
labors
were
devoted
to
more
detailed
research
in
a
smaller
field
this
region
about
as
large
as
mexico
and
central
america
extends
north
and
south
from
tanganyika
to
the
zambesi
and
covers
the
wide
region
of
the
congo
sources
between
nyassa
and
lake
bangweolo
the
greatest
results
were
the
discovery
of
lake
nyassa
and
the
shire
river
now
the
water
route
into
east
central
africa
lakes
bangweolo
and
mwero
and
the
mapping
of
the
eastern
part
of
the
sources
of
the
upper
congo
which
livingstone
believed
to
the
day
of
his
death
were
the
ultimate
fountains
of
the
nile
livingstone
last
journeys
was
published
from
the
manuscript
which
his
faithful
servants
brought
to
the
seacoast
with
the
mortal
remains
of
their
gentle
master
not
far
from
the
south
coast
of
bangweolo
stands
a
wooden
construction
to
which
is
affixed
a
bronze
tablet
bearing
the
simple
inscription
livingstone
died
here
ilala
may
it
has
taken
the
place
of
the
tree
under
which
he
died
and
where
his
heart
which
had
been
so
true
to
africa
was
buried
as
the
tree
was
nearly
dead
the
section
bearing
the
rude
inscription
cut
by
one
of
his
servants
was
carefully
removed
and
is
now
in
london
livingstone
geographical
delineations
were
remarkably
accurate
considering
the
inadequate
surveying
instruments
with
which
he
worked
ravenstein
one
of
the
greatest
authorities
on
african
cartography
has
said
i
should
be
loath
to
reject
livingstone
work
simply
because
the
ground
which
he
was
the
first
to
explore
has
since
his
death
been
gone
over
by
another
explorer
it
would
be
marvellous
however
if
in
the
course
of
twenty
years
of
exploration
he
had
not
made
some
blunders
his
map
of
lake
bangweolo
for
example
was
very
inaccurate
the
lokinga
mountains
which
he
mapped
to
the
south
of
the
lake
have
not
been
found
by
later
explorers
these
imperfections
resulted
from
the
fact
that
his
map
of
bangweolo
and
its
neighborhood
was
largely
based
upon
native
information
he
knew
that
his
map
was
inadequate
and
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
travel
he
returned
to
bangweolo
to
complete
his
survey
he
was
making
straight
for
the
true
outlet
of
the
lake
and
was
within
miles
of
it
when
one
morning
his
servants
found
him
in
his
lowly
straw
hut
dead
on
his
knees
if
livingstone
had
lived
a
few
weeks
longer
and
been
able
to
travel
he
and
not
giraud
would
have
given
us
the
true
map
of
bangweolo
as
a
whole
livingstone
work
in
geography
anthropology
and
natural
history
stands
the
test
of
time
no
river
in
africa
has
yet
been
laid
down
with
greater
accuracy
than
the
zambesi
as
delineated
by
this
explorer
the
success
of
livingstone
was
both
brilliant
and
unsullied
the
apostle
and
the
pioneer
of
africa
he
went
on
his
way
without
fear
without
egotism
without
desire
of
reward
he
proved
that
the
white
man
may
travel
safely
through
many
years
in
africa
he
observed
richness
of
soil
and
abundance
of
natural
products
the
guarantees
of
commerce
he
foretold
the
truth
that
the
african
tribes
would
be
brought
into
the
community
of
nations
the
logical
result
of
the
work
he
began
and
carried
so
far
was
the
downfall
of
the
african
which
he
denounced
as
the
open
sore
of
the
world
what
eulogy
is
too
great
for
such
a
work
and
such
a
man
in
journeys
had
been
made
by
explorers
from
sea
to
sea
livingstone
completed
the
first
journey
from
loanda
to
the
mouth
of
the
zambesi
in
one
year
seven
months
and
days
nineteen
years
elapsed
before
central
africa
was
crossed
again
when
cameron
gave
two
years
and
nearly
eight
months
to
the
journey
it
took
stanley
two
years
and
eight
months
to
cross
africa
when
he
solved
the
great
mystery
the
course
of
the
congo
and
when
he
went
to
the
relief
of
emin
pasha
in
he
was
almost
exactly
the
same
time
on
the
road
when
trivier
crossed
from
the
atlantic
to
the
indian
ocean
in
in
nine
days
less
than
a
year
the
event
was
held
as
a
remarkably
rapid
performance
a
little
later
the
journey
was
made
by
several
travellers
in
from
twelve
to
fifteen
months
in
the
englishman
lloyd
crossed
from
lake
victoria
to
the
mouth
of

thirteen

a
journey
that
occupied
speke
for
nine
and
stanley
for
eight

with
the
present
facilities
the
continent
may
be
crossed
by
way
of
the
lake
region
and
the
congo
in
about
three
months
the
era
of
long
and
weary
has
nearly
ended
now
succeeds
travel
by
steam
no
influence
has
been
so
potent
in
improving
the
art
of
the
explorer
or
in
raising
the
standard
of
the
work
required
of
him
as
the
enormous
interest
that
for
thirty
years
past
has
centred
in
african
exploration
the
larger
part
of
the
best
achievements
of
the
explorers
of
the
present
generation
in
scientific
investigation
and
in
an
approach
to
scientific
are
found
in
tropical
africa
many
of
the
hundreds
of
the
route
surveys
are
not
unworthy
to
be
compared
with
those
of
pogge
and
wissmann
when
they
laid
down
on
their
map
every
cultural
and
topographic
feature
for
two
miles
on
both
sides
of
their
route
from
angola
to
the
upper
congo
the
extreme
care
with
which
some
of
the
best
explorers
have
performed
their
tasks
is
illustrated
by
the
remarkable
achievement
of
the
late
junker
along
the
mobangi
river
after
years
of
service
his
scientific
equipment
had
become
practically
worthless
he
started
on
his
journey
down
the
river
through
the
jungle
with
absolutely
no
instrument
except
a
compass
to
aid
him
in
determining
his
positions
endeavoring
by
the
most
scrupulous
care
to
make
up
as
far
as
possible
for
his
lack
of
scientific
outfit
he
trudged
through
the
grass
compass
in
hand
counting
every
step
every
fifteen
minutes
he
jotted
in
his
notebook
the
distance
and
the
mean
direction
travelled
at
night
he
used
these
accumulated
data
to
lay
down
on
his
route
map
the
journey
of
the
day
for
many
weeks
he
kept
up
this
trying
routine
till
he
reached
his
furthest
west
and
again
till
he
had
returned
to
his
whose
latitude
and
longitude
he
had
previously
determined
when
he
returned
to
europe
hassenstein
and
he
made
a
map
from
the
data
junker
had
collected
and
fixed
the
position
of
his
furthest
west
this
position
was
found
later
by
the
astronomical
observations
of
lieutenant
le
marinel
to
be
less
than
two
miles
out
of
the
way
one
of
the
latest
to
win
a
large
prize
in
african
discovery
is
donaldson
smith
a
young
physician
of
philadelphia
in
the
northeastern
region
known
as
somaliland
and
gallaland
his
method
may
be
mentioned
here
as
an
illustration
of
the
kind
of
work
that
geographers
now
require
before
he
began
his
explorations
he
took
a
thorough
course
in
the
use
of
surveying
instruments
and
the
methods
of
accurately
laying
down
his
positions
and
making
a
route
map
many
a
cartographer
burning
with
desire
to
draw
a
good
map
of
a
newly
explored
region
has
been
driven
to
despair
by
the
inadequacy
of
the
route
surveys
in
his
hands
not
a
few
of
these
surveys
have
been
unworthy
of
reproduction
in
the
books
of
the
explorers
who
made
them
and
the
best
that
could
be
done
was
to
generalize
their
information
on
maps
of
comparatively
small
scale
but
donaldson
smith
appear
in
his
book
on
the
comparatively
large
scale
of
about
sixteen
statute
miles
to
the
inch
and
they
are
worthy
of
that
treatment
for
his
surveys
and
observations
for
geographical
positions
were
recorded
in
such
a
way
that
their
value
might
be
easily
ascertained
by
any
one
familiar
with
such
computations
his
have
been
found
to
be
admirable
material
thus
he
has
not
only
traversed
a
new
region
of
great
extent
but
has
given
in
his
map
ample
materials
which
may
be
employed
by
any
in
the
production
of
good
maps
of
all
the
territory
that
came
under
his
observation
when
sir
clements
markham
presented
to
smith
the
patrons
medal
of
the
royal
geographical
society
he
said
you
have
not
like
an
ordinary
explorer
made
a
common
route
survey
but
you
have
made
a
scientific
survey
a
triangulation
frequently
checked
by
astronomical
observations
with
theodolite
and
chronometer
most
african
explorers
have
been
painstaking
conscientious
workers
eager
in
their
quest
for
the
truth
desirous
to
report
nothing
but
the
truth
and
treating
the
lowly
and
ignorant
they
have
met
as
men
with
sensibilities
like
their
own
capable
of
gratitude
for
a
kindness
and
keenly
sensitive
to
an
outrage
the
world
has
recognized
and
applauded
such
heroes
of
discovery
the
men
who
faced
hardship
and
peril
enduring
and
sacrificing
much
that
knowledge
might
grow
who
had
to
conquer
not
only
unkind
nature
but
to
overcome
the
ignorant
violence
of
man
and
not
a
few
of
the
leaders
in
this
work
have
carried
it
out
with
a
degree
of
tactfulness
humanity
gentleness
and
kindliness
of
spirit
amounting
to
genius
some
of
them
spent
months
in
disguise
collecting
facts
of
the
highest
scientific
value
among
fanatical
mohammedans
who
would
have
killed
them
if
they
had
known
their
secret
such
men
were
burton
in
harrar
lenz
in
timbuctoo
and
de
foucauld
and
harris
in
morocco
who
in
stained
skins
and
borrowed
costumes
personated
merchants
and
devotees
and
doctors
and
jews
and
most
of
whom
have
enriched
the
literature
of
discovery
with
valuable
books
men
also
such
as
junker
who
rich
as
he
was
left
his
home
to
spend
eight
years
alone
among
the
savages
of
the
welle
makua
basin
in
central
africa
living
on
their
food
and
in
their
huts
that
he
might
minutely
study
the
people
in
their
country
or
grenfell
who
has
travelled
far
more
widely
in
the
congo
basin
than
stanley
or
any
of
his
followers
except
delcommune
and
revealed
to
the
world
more
river
systems
and
unknown
peoples
than
they
and
who
in
his
long
career
as
an
explorer
never
fired
a
shot
upon
a
native
though
his
life
was
often
threatened
these
men
and
others
like
them
have
exemplified
the
manysidedness
of
human
resources
against
a
great
variety
of
peril
and
obstacle
as
no
other
explorers
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
have
had
an
opportunity
to
do
in
equal
measure
their
work
with
its
environment
of
almost
overwhelming
difficulty
should
be
known
to
our
youth
as
most
forceful
illustrations
of
what
good
men
may
dare
and
do
in
good
causes
and
in
a
worthy
manner
there
have
been
some
exceptions
to
this
rule
a
few
men
have
been
less
anxious
to
perform
useful
service
than
to
figure
in
the
newspapers
and
pose
before
their
public
one
day
a
man
stood
on
the
north
shore
of
victoria
nyanza
and
looking
south
he
saw
land
when
he
returned
to
london
he
published
a
sensational
book
in
which
he
said
it
was
ridiculous
for
speke
to
assert
that
he
had
discovered
a
lake
as
large
as
scotland
one
of
the
greatest
lakes
in
the
world
why
said
the
writer
i
have
stood
on
the
north
shore
of
the
victoria
nyanza
and
looked
south
and
seen
the
southern
shore
lake
victoria
is
only
an
insignificant
sheet
of
water
after
all
the
talk
of
its
being
second
only
to
lake
superior
what
he
really
saw
was
the
chain
of
the
sesse
islands
extending
far
out
into
the
lake
his
book
was
scarcely
off
the
press
when
the
letters
describing
stanley
boat
journeys
around
the
shores
of
victoria
nyanza
began
to
be
published
in
london
and
new
york
and
the
foolish
fellow
was
compelled
to
recall
all
the
copies
of
his
book
that
had
not
passed
beyond
his
reach
and
eliminate
the
statements
that
made
him
so
ridiculous
fortunately
there
are
not
many
explorers
of
this
stripe
all
who
watched
the
progress
of
african
discovery
were
constantly
reminded
that
geographical
progress
is
usually
made
only
by
slow
and
painful
steps
they
saw
an
explorer
emerge
from
the
unknown
with
his
notebooks
and
route
maps
replete
with
most
interesting
facts
for
the
student
and
the
cartographer
then
another
explorer
would
enter
the
same
region
discover
facts
that
had
escaped
the
notice
of
the
pioneer
correct
blunders
his
predecessor
had
made
and
perpetrate
blunders
of
his
own
so
explorer
followed
explorer
each
adding
something
to
geographical
knowledge
each
correcting
earlier
misconceptions
till
the
total
product
well
sifted
by
critical
geographers
gave
the
world
a
fair
idea
of
the
region
explored
but
not
the
best
attainable
idea
for
scientific
knowledge
of
a
region
comes
only
with
its
detailed
exploration
by
trained
observers
equipped
with
the
best
appliances
for
use
in
their
special
fields
of
research
this
is
the
advanced
stage
of
geographical
study
which
is
now
being
reached
in
many
parts
of
africa
it
was
livingstone
task
in
to
inform
us
that
there
was
a
great
lake
nyassa
it
was
rhoades
task
in
to
make
a
careful
and
accurate
survey
of
its
and
to
sound
its
depths
so
that
we
now
have
an
excellent
idea
of
the
conformation
of
the
lake
bottom
between
livingstone
and
rhoades
came
many
explorers
each
adding
important
facts
to
our
knowledge
of
this
great
sheet
of
water
nearly
twice
as
large
as
new
jersey
as
each
explorer
came
from
the
wilds
our
maps
were
corrected
to
conform
with
the
new
information
he
supplied
and
if
we
should
examine
the
maps
of
africa
in
school
geographies
atlases
and
wall
maps
from
the
time
of
livingstone
to
the
present
day
we
should
see
that
as
relates
to
nearly
every
part
of
africa
they
have
been
in
a
continual
state
of
transition
for
years
our
only
map
of
victoria
nyanza
was
that
which
speke
made
on
his
second
journey
to
the
lake
in
but
speke
saw
the
great
lake
only
at
one
point
on
its
south
shore
and
along
its
northwest
and
north
central
coasts
his
map
being
based
very
largely
upon
native
information
was
in
many
respects
most
incomplete
and
erroneous
then
came
stanley
survey
of
the
lake
made
in
a
boat
journey
around
its
coasts
and
for
years
his
map
supplanted
that
of
speke
but
he
was
not
able
to
follow
the
in
all
its
intricate
details
his
mapping
was
a
great
advance
upon
that
of
speke
but
it
was
necessarily
rough
and
imperfect
he
missed
entirely
the
deep
indentation
of
baumann
gulf
and
the
southwestern
prolongation
of
the
lake
surveyed
by
father
schynse
in
stanley
map
modified
by
the
partial
surveys
of
various
explorers
is
still
our
mapping
of
the
lake
but
if
the
reader
will
watch
the
maps
for
the
next
year
or
so
he
will
doubtless
observe
important
changes
in
the
contours
of
victoria
nyanza
for
all
the
maps
from
speke
to
those
of
will
be
placed
on
the
shelf
to
serve
only
as
the
historical
record
of
the
good
honest
work
which
a
number
of
explorers
have
done
commander
whitehouse
has
recently
spent
thirteen
months
surveying
with
infinite
pains
these
coasts
and

writes
stanley
of
this
important
service
the
sailor
with
his
small
crew
and
his
little
steel
boat
wandering
from
point
to
point
crossing
and
recrossing
going
from
some
island
to
some
headland
taking
his
bearings
from
that
headland
back
again
to
the
island
and
to
some
point
far
away
commander
whitehouse
has
made
a
new
delineation
of
the
entire
miles
of
coasts
and
the
results
of
his
survey
will
be
used
in
making
all
the
maps
of
the
lake
his
map
in
turn
will
undoubtedly
be
replaced
some
day
by
detailed
topographic
surveys
of
the
best
quality
such
as
the
british
already
contemplate
making
of
that
entire
region
a
wall
map
recently
in
use
in
one
of
the
public
schools
of
new
york
city
was
a
curious
example
of
ignorant
compilation
it
exhibited
the
victoria
nyanza
of
speke
the
bangweolo
of
livingstone
and
the
upper
congo
of
stanley
all
obsolete
for
practical
purposes
years
before
this
map
was
printed
most
of
our
home
were
very
slow
in
availing
themselves
of
the
rich
materials
constantly
supplied
for
the
maps
by
the
army
of
explorers
in
africa
but
the
most
alert
cartographers
particularly
between
and
could
not
keep
their
maps
abreast
of
the
news
of
discovery
as
it
came
to
europe
more
men
and
energy
and
money
were
utilized
in
those
fifteen
years
of
african
discovery
than
in
the
first
century
and
a
half
of
american
exploration
the
route
or
some
covering
a
wide
extent
of
country
others
devoted
to
a
small
area
or
a
short
line
of
travel
were
going
to
europe
for
the
improvement
of
atlas
sheets
by
nearly
every
steamer
father
chart
of
the
southwest
extension
of
victoria
nyanza
had
hardly
been
utilized
in
european
before
it
was
replaced
by
more
accurate
survey
wauters
of
belgium
withdrew
his
large
map
of
the
congo
basin
from
the
printer
four
times
in
order
to
include
fresh
information
before
it
was
finally
issued
to
the
public
this
process
is
still
going
on
though
more
slowly
the
mapping
we
see
of
lake
tanganyika
one
of
the
longest
lakes
in
the
world
has
been
in
use
for
seventeen
years
since
missionary
hore
made
his
boat
journey
of
one
thousand
miles
around
its
coasts
but
the
new
map
of
the
moore
expedition
now
being
introduced
gives
the
main
axis
of
the
lake
a
more
northeast
and
southwest
direction
the
hore
map
has
met
the
fate
that
usually
overtakes
the
early
surveys
of
every
region
it
rendered
good
service
as
long
as
it
was
the
best
map
but
the
moore
expedition
had
appliances
for
computing
longitudes
and
as
captain
hore
lacked
these
it
is
not
strange
that
his
map
has
been
found
to
be
defective
the
world
has
been
treated
to
many
geographical
surprises
in
the
course
of
this
incessant
transformation
of
the
map
of
the
continent
many
of
us
may
remember
in
our
school
geographies
the
particular
blackness
and
prominence
of
the
kong
mountains
extending
for
two
hundred
miles
parallel
with
the
gulf
of
guinea
they
were
accepted
on
the
authority
of
mungo
park
caillié
and
bowditch
all
reputable
explorers
who
had
not
seen
the
mountains
but
believed
from
native
information
that
they
existed
the
french
explorer
binger
in
sought
in
vain
for
them
later
explorers
have
been
unable
to
find
them
they
are
in
fact
a
myth
and
will
be
remembered
chiefly
as
a
conspicuous
instance
of
geographic
delusion
it
had
long
been
supposed
that
the
navigation
of
the
niger
river
the
third
largest
river
in
africa
was
permanently
impaired
by
the
bussa
rapids
about
one
hundred
miles
in
length
where
mungo
park
was
wrecked
and
drowned
but
major
toutée
a
few
years
ago
when
assailed
by
hostile
natives
made
a
safe
journey
with
his
boats
through
the
rapids
and
captain
lenfant
in
carried
pounds
of
supplies
up
the
river
and
through
the
rapids
to
the
french
stations
between
bussa
and
timbuktu
he
had
a
small
steamboat
and
a
number
of
little
boats
propelled
by
fifty
black
paddlers
he
says
that
by
the
land
route
he
would
have
required
porters
and
they
would
have
been
one
hundred
and
thirty
days
on
the
road
it
was
believed
that
a
land
portage
would
always
be
necessary
between
the
sea
and
the
zambesi
above
the
delta
till
when
rankin
discovered
the
chinde
branch
of
the
delta
so
broad
and
so
deep
that
ocean
vessels
may
ascend
it
and
exchange
freight
with
the
river
craft
it
has
been
found
that
more
water
pours
into
the
ocean
through
the
congo
mouth
which
is
six
miles
wide
than
from
all
the
other
rivers
in
africa
together
it
is
second
among
the
world
rivers
and
the
dark
detritus
it
carries
to
the
atlantic
has
been
distinctly
traced
on
the
ocean
bed
for
six
hundred
miles
from
the
land
some
geographers
still
believed
thirty
years
ago
that
all
the
waters
of
its
upper
basin
might
be
tributary
to
the
nile
have
been
kept
very
busy
recording
discoveries
on
the
congo
about
one
hundred
explorers
some
of
them
missionaries
and
many
employees
of
the
congo
free
state
have
mapped
the
whole
basin
along
its
and
discovered
the
ultimate
source
of
its
main
stream
our
ideas
of
the
hydrography
of
this
great
basin
have
been
revolutionized
since
stanley
second
only
to
livingstone
among
the
great
african
explorers
in
revealed
the
course
of
the
main
river
on
his
map
for
example
he
showed
the
southern
tributaries
as
probably
flowing
nearly
due
north
but
all
except
one
of
these
rivers
rise
in
the
east
and
flow
far
to
the
west
when
wissmann
was
sent
to
the
upper
kassai
to
follow
it
to
the
congo
he
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
himself
floating
westward
week
after
week
when
he
reached
the
congo
a
steamboat
was
waiting
for
him
at
equatorville
two
hundred
miles
further
up
the
river
where
he
was
expected
to
emerge
schweinfurth
believed
the
welle
makua
flowed
north
to
lake
chad
on
the
edge
of
the
sahara
seventeen
years
later
after
six
or
seven
explorers
had
tried
to
solve
the
problem
the
river
was
found
to
be
the
upper
part
of
the
mobangi
tributary
of
the
congo
larger
than
any
rivers
of
europe
excepting
the
volga
and
danube
while
stanley
was
for
five
years
planting
his
stations
on
the
congo
he
knew
nothing
of
this
great
tributary
miles
long
whose
mouth
was
hidden
by
a
cluster
of
islands
which
his
steamers
repeatedly
passed
missionary
grenfell
on
his
little
steamer
was
ascending
the
congo
one
day
when
accidentally
he
got
into
the
mouth
of
the
mobangi
and
went
on
for
one
hundred
miles
before
he
discovered
that
he
had
left
the
main
river
few
explorers
have
unwittingly
stumbled
upon
so
rich
a
geographical
prize
while
exploratory
enterprises
have
been
centred
largely
in
tropical
africa
no
part
of
the
continent
has
been
neglected
we
now
know
that
large
areas
of
the
sahara
are
underlaid
by
waters
which
need
only
be
brought
to
the
surface
to
cover
the
desert
around
them
with
verdure
that
most
of
the
rain
falling
on
the
south
slopes
of
the
atlas
mountains
sinks
into
the
earth
to
impermeable
strata
of
rock
along
which
it
makes
its
way
far
out
into
the
desert
that
where
the
surface
is
depressed
so
that
these
waters
come
near
to
it
there
are
wells
for
the
refreshment
of
the
camel
caravans
and
oases
blooming
islands
of
green
in
the
sterile
wastes
and
that
artesian
wells
bring
inexhaustible
supplies
of
water
within
reach
so
that
millions
of
date
palms
have
been
planted
along
the
northern
edge
of
the
desert
in
southern
algiers
and
tunis
making
these
regions
the
largest
sources
of
the
world
supply
of
dates
it
has
also
been
discovered
why
there
are
very
large
areas
of
dry
or
desert
lands
in
africa
the
sahara
and
the
southwest
of
africa
are
deserts
because
the
prevailing
winds
the
carriers
of
moisture
blow
towards
the
sea
instead
of
away
from
it
and
consequently
are
always
dry
the
winds
from
the
indian
ocean
crossing
the
highlands
of
abyssinia
are
wrung
nearly
dry
while
passing
the
mountains
and
so
somaliland
and
the
lowlands
to
the
south
of
abyssinia
are
parched
it
has
been
found
that
the
most
of
south
africa
stands
so
high
above
the
sea
that
the
influences
of
a
temperate
climate
are
projected
far
towards
the
equator
so
that
many
white
men
women
and
children
are
living
and
thriving
on
farms
in
mashonaland
seven
degrees
of
latitude
nearer
the
equator
than
the
south
end
of
florida
this
fact
will
profoundly
influence
the
development
of
south
africa
it
is
to
be
the
home
of
millions
of
the
white
race
the
seat
of
a
highly
civilized
empire
whose
business
relations
with
the
rest
of
the
world
will
be
to
the
advantage
of
every
trading
nation
the
presence
of
these
millions
of
toilers
will
vitally
affect
the
work
of
developing
tropical
africa
which
is
now
absorbing
such
enormous
treasure
and
energy
for
south
africa
is
to
be
brought
by
railroads
to
the
very
doors
of
the
tropical
zone
it
is
hoped
that
such
facts
as
these
even
though
very
briefly
stated
may
convey
broadly
a
correct
impression
of
the
magnitude
of
african
exploration
since
its
revival
about
the
time
that
livingstone
died
it
is
impossible
in
brief
space
to
signalize
the
good
work
that
many
of
the
most
conspicuous
pioneers
have
done
the
world
rendered
tardy
tribute
to
the
notable
achievements
of
some
of
them
when
rebmann
discovered
kilimanjaro
not
far
from
the
equator
and
told
of
the
snows
that
crown
the
loftiest
of
african
summits
it
was
decided
by
british
geographers
that
rebmann
snow
was
probably
an
imaginary
aspect
the
snow
was
there
and
plenty
of
it
but
rebmann
died
before
justice
was
done
to
his
faithful
labors
when
paul
du
chaillu
described
the
obongo
dwarfs
of
west
africa
his
narrative
was
discredited
but
four
or
five
groups
of
dwarfs
probably
numbering
many
thousands
are
now
known
to
be
scattered
from
the
lower
border
of
abyssinia
to
the
kalahara
desert
in
the
far
south
the
ancients
had
heard
of
the
dwarfs
but
the
geographers
of
the
eighteenth
century
expunged
from
the
maps
of
africa
about
all
that
the
geographers
of
greece
and
rome
as
well
as
those
of
later
times
placed
on
them
and
the
nineteenth
century
was
slow
in
crediting
the
early
investigators
even
with
statements
that
were
wholly
or
approximately
accurate
a
curious
history
is
connected
with
the
discovery
of
the
northeastern
group
of
pygmies
a
little
south
of
abyssinia
no
white
man
had
ever
seen
them
but
about
fifteen
years
ago
henry
schlichter
of
the
british
museum
collected
all
the
information
which
natives
had
given
to
missionaries
traders
and
explorers
of
the
existence
of
these
little
people
some
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
sea
sifting
all
this
evidence
he
concluded
that
these
dwarfs
really
existed
and
that
they
lived
in
a
region
which
he
marked
on
the
map
north
of
lake
stefanie
donaldson
smith
had
not
heard
of
schlichter
paper
and
knew
nothing
of
these
dwarfs
but
he
found
them
in
in
the
region
which
schlichter
had
indicated
as
their
probable
habitat
the
broadest
generalization
with
regard
to
the
african
tribes
is
that
which
separates
most
of
the
peoples
south
of
the
sahara
desert
into
two
great
groups
the
negro
tribes
whose
habitat
may
be
roughly
indicated
as
extending
between
the
atlantic
and
gallaland
in
east
africa
with
the
sahara
as
their
northern
and
the
latitude
of
the
cameroons
as
their
southern
boundaries
and
the
bantu
tribes
occupying
nearly
all
of
africa
south
of
the
negroes
the
distinction
between
these
two
great
groups
is
not
based
upon
special
differences
as
to
physical
structure
mental
characteristics
habits
or
development
but
depends
solely
upon
philological
considerations
the
languages
of
the
negroes
and
the
bantus
forming
two
distinct
groups
most
of
the
slaves
who
were
brought
to
our
country
were
negroes
while
most
of
those
transported
to
latin
america
were
from
the
bantu
tribes
one
fact
that
stood
out
above
all
others
in
the
study
of
the
african
natives
was
the
remarkable
prevalence
of
cannibalism
in
the
congo
basin
in
all
his
wanderings
livingstone
met
only
one
cannibal
tribe
the
manyema
living
between
tanganyika
and
the
upper
congo
but
though
they
are
not
found
near
the
sources
of
the
river
nor
near
its
mouth
they
occupy
about
of
the
congo
basin
they
are
regarded
with
fear
and
abhorrence
by
all
tribes
not
addicted
to
the
practice
they
number
several
millions
instead
of
being
the
most
debased
of
human
creatures
many
of
them
in
physical
strength
and
courage
in
their
iron
work
carving
weaving
and
other
arts
are
among
the
most
advanced
of
african
tribes
the
larger
part
of
the
natives
in
the
service
of
the
congo
free
state
are
from
the
cannibal
tribes
the
laws
now
impose
severe
penalties
for
acts
of
cannibalism
and
the
evil
is
decreasing
as
the
influence
of
the
state
is
extended
over
wider
areas
a
few
isolated
tribes
along
the
gulf
of
guinea
are
also
cannibals
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
helpful
influences
of
the
caucasian
in
every
part
of
africa
so
far
outweigh
his
harmful
influences
that
the
latter
are
but
a
drop
in
the
bucket
in
comparison
it
is
most
unfortunate
that
a
certain
admixture
of
blundering
severity
brutality
and
wickedness
seems
inseparable
from
the
development
of
all
the
newer
parts
of
the
world
the
demoralizing
drink
traffic
the
scandalous
injustice
and
cruelty
of
some
of
the
agents
of
civilized
governments
are
not
to
be
belittled
or
condoned
but
there
is
also
a
very
bright
side
to
the
story
of
the
white
occupancy
of
africa
the
family
of
a
deceased
chief
in
central
africa
recently
preserved
his
body
unburied
for
fourteen
months
in
the
hope
that
they
might
prevail
upon
the
british
government
to
permit
the
sacrifice
of
women
and
slaves
on
his
grave
that
he
might
have
companions
of
his
own
household
in
the
other
world
he
was
buried
at
last
without
shedding
a
drop
of
blood
human
sacrifices
are
now
punishable
with
death
throughout
a
large
part
of
barbarous
africa
and
the
terrible
evil
is
being
abated
as
fast
as
the
influence
of
the
european
governments
is
extended
over
new
regions
the
practice
of
the
arts
of
fetichism
a
kind
of
chicanery
most
injurious
in
its
effects
upon
the
superstitious
natives
is
now
punishable
throughout
the
congo
free
state
and
british
rhodesia
arab
no
longer
raid
the
congo
plains
and
forests
for
slaves
killing
seven
persons
for
every
one
they
lead
into
captivity
has
been
utterly
wiped
out
in
all
parts
of
africa
except
in
portions
of
the
sudan
and
other
districts
over
which
white
rule
has
not
yet
been
asserted
the
arabs
of
the
congo
who
went
there
from
east
africa
solely
that
they
might
grow
rich
in
the
slave
trade
are
now
settled
quietly
on
their
rice
and
banana
plantations
the
sale
of
strong
drink
has
been
restricted
by
international
agreement
to
the
coast
regions
where
the
traffic
has
long
existed
and
its
evils
are
somewhat
mitigated
there
by
the
regulations
now
enforced
fifty
thousand
congo
natives
who
would
not
carry
a
pound
of
freight
for
stanley
in
are
now
in
the
service
of
the
white
enterprises
many
of
them
working
not
for
barter
goods
but
for
coin
many
of
the
missionary
fields
are
thriving
and
wonderful
results
have
been
achieved
in
some
of
them
in
uganda
where
stanley
in
saw
king
mtesa
impaling
his
victims
there
are
now
ninety
thousand
natives
professing
christianity
three
hundred
and
twenty
churches
and
many
thousands
of
children
in
the
schools
fifty
thousand
of
the
people
can
read
between
and
stanley
carried
three
little
steamboats
around
miles
of
rapids
to
the
upper
congo
eighty
steamers
are
now
afloat
there
plying
on
nearly
miles
of
rivers
and
connected
with
the
sea
by
a
railroad
that
has
paid
dividends
from
the
day
it
was
opened
at
the
end
of
there
were
only
miles
of
railroad
in
africa
about
miles
are
now
in
operation
and
the
end
of
this
decade
is
certain
to
see
miles
of
railroads
trains
are
running
from
cairo
to
khartum
the
seat
of
the
mahdist
tyranny
in
the
centre
of
a
vast
region
which
until
recently
had
been
closed
for
many
years
to
all
the
world
these
wonderful
results
are
the
fruits
of
the
partition
of
africa
among
the
european
states
with
the
exception
of
some
waste
regions
in
the
libyan
desert
which
no
one
has
claimed
morocco
abyssinia
and
liberia
every
square
mile
of
african
territory
has
been
divided
among
european
powers
either
as
colonies
or
as
spheres
of
influence
the
scramble
of
twenty
years
for
african
lands
is
at
an
end
there
now
being
no
valuable
areas
that
are
not
covered
by
the
existing
agreements
it
is
no
mere
love
of
humanity
that
has
impelled
the
european
countries
to
divide
these
regions
among
themselves
we
can
scarcely
realize
the
intensity
of
the
struggle
for
existence
in
many
of
the
overcrowded
parts
of
europe
their
factories
are
enormously
productive
but
their
people
will
suffer
for
food
unless
they
can
export
manufactures
the
crying
need
for
new
markets
for
new
sources
of
raw
material
drove
these
states
into
africa
and
we
should
be
glad
for
africa
sake
that
they
have
gone
there
even
though
the
desire
to
make
money
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
incentives
it
is
under
the
protective
aegis
of
these
governments
that
explorers
are
settling
down
in
smaller
areas
to
see
what
may
be
found
between
the
explored
to
study
the
continent
in
detail
to
give
to
our
knowledge
of
africa
the
scientific
quality
now
required
the
greatest
geographical
work
there
in
recent
years
is
the
extension
of
a
line
of
stations
across
tropical
africa
by
commander
lemaire
each
position
astronomically
fixed
by
the
most
careful
methods
constituting
a
east
and
west
through
africa
to
which
the
scientific
mapping
of
a
very
large
area
will
be
referred
the
day
of
the
minuter
study
of
the
whole
continent
has
now
dawned
and
we
are
witnessing
a
most
notable
work
all
the
colonial
powers
and
the
germans
most
conspicuously
are
studying
the
economic
questions
relating
to
their
african
possessions
the
suitability
of
climates
for
colonists
the
essential
rules
of
hygiene
the
development
of
agriculture
labor
supplies
transportation
and
commercial
facilities
and
many
other
problems
are
receiving
the
most
careful
attention
experiment
stations
are
maintained
in
the
colonies
and
colonial
schools
at
home
to
fit
young
men
for
service
in
the
field
the
germans
have
already
proved
that
cotton
and
tobacco
are
certain
to
become
profitable
export
crops
the
of
the
witwatersrand
on
which
johannesburg
stands
have
begun
a
movement
which
they
hope
will
result
in
the
immigration
of
white
laborers
to
the
mining
field
we
may
look
for
remarkable
development
in
south
africa
whose
promise
is
larger
than
that
of
any
other
part
of
the
continent
whatever
may
be
said
of
some
of
the
methods
by
which
the
british
have
enlarged
their
empire
their
rule
has
blessed
the
barbarous
peoples
whose
countries
they
have
absorbed
the
task
of
improving
the
few
millions
of
blacks
in
south
africa
and
of
developing
the
large
and
in
some
respects
wonderful
resources
of
that
region
will
be
greatly
assisted
by
the
incoming
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
europeans
bringing
with
them
the
arts
and
other
blessings
of
civilization
the
future
of
none
of
the
newer
parts
of
the
world
is
brighter
with
the
hope
of
great
development
than
the
region
between
the
zambesi
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
order
to
observe
intelligently
the
progress
of
south
africa
in
coming
years
the
limitations
as
well
as
the
advantages
of
the
country
must
be
kept
in
view
more
than
half
of
it
including
the
entire
western
half
is
deficient
in
rainfall
and
can
never
be
the
home
of
a
dense
white
population
some
mining
will
develop
on
those
broad
dry
plains
and
sandy
wastes
some
agriculture
where
irrigation
is
possible
and
great
wherever
thrive
the
nutritious

on
which
sheep
scattered
over
the
karroo
of
cape
colony
and
in
the
little
orange
free
state
were
grazing
before
the
recent
war
will
always
be
the
greatest
grazing
industry
though
cattle
and
horses
are
raised
in
large
numbers
and
the
fine

the

never
saw
such
a

more

was
produced
in

before

than
was

by
any

country
in
the

the
other
rich

regions
of
the

and
other
parts
of
south

have
been
completely
dwarfed
by
the
wonderful
product
of

the
surveys
in
matabeleland
and
mashonaland
show
areas
square
miles
in
extent
which
as
yet
have
practically
no
development
the
mining
companies
on

and
elsewhere
are
now
preparing
for
far
larger
operations
than
ever
before
the

turning
out
more
than

supply
nearly
all
the

two

scarcely
been

and
diamonds
are
found
on

and
in
other
regions
where
no

has
been
undertaken
the
minerals
of
south

including

bid
fair
to
be
for
many
years
the
largest
sources
of
wealth
and
in

fresh

and
some
other

may
rival
other

of
the

there
are
no

but
by
great
expenditure
the
harbors
of

elizabeth
east
london
and

have
been
adapted
for

many
persons
mistakenly
regard
cape
town
as
the
chief
commercial
centre
of
south
africa
it
is
so
only
in
respect
of
the
export
of
gold
and
diamonds
as
it
is
not
centrally
situated
for
business
with
the

more
of
the
things
that
south
africa
sells
to
and
buys
from
the
rest
of
the
world
excepting
gold
and
diamonds
pass
through
port
elizabeth
than
through
any
other
port
here
is
centred
the
largest
wholesale
trade
what
south
africa
needs
is
more
railroads
and
more
white
labor
manufacturing
industries
on
an
important
scale
are
yet
to
come
for
as
yet
the
white
population
is
too
sparse
to
develop
anything
but
the
natural
products
of
the
country
the
broad
summing
up
of
the
future
work
in
africa
is
that
the
native
will
be
taught
to
help
himself
the
destiny
of
the
continent
depends
largely
upon
his
development
for
great
parts
of
africa
may
never
be
adapted
to
become
the
home
of
many
white
men
the
most
powerful

philanthropic
and
selfish
incite
and
will
sustain
the
work
of
helping
these
millions
to
rise
to
a
higher
plane
of
humanity
this
work
now
well
begun
is
the
great
task
which
in
the
present
century
will
call
for

it
was
long
centuries
ago
that
a
greek
soldier
of
fortune
who
had
the
honor
to
be
also
a
disciple
of
socrates
was
leading
ten
thousand
mercenaries
back
to
their
native
land
after
their
famous
failure
to
set
the
younger
cyrus
on
the
throne
of
persia
clearchus
and
the
other
generals
had
been
treacherously
murdered
dispirited
almost
hopeless
on
their
way
to
the
black
sea
in
anticipation
of
the
perilous
and
tedious
journey
past
wild
mountains
and
wilder
kurds
they
toiled
up
the
valley
of
the

river
of
one
incident
of
their
journey
their
historian

they
reached
the
spot
where
now
stands
the
city
of
mosul
on
the
bank
of
the
river
their
eyes
fell
on
a
bare
and
lofty
hill
they
did
not
know
they
never
suspected
xenophon
wrote
no
word
of
it
that
under
that
hill
lay
buried
the
ruins
of
one
of
the
mightiest
conquering
cities
that
had
ever
ruled
the
world
from
the
palaces
of
that
hill
ninus
and
semiramis
and
sardanapalus
had
led
their
conquering
armies
all
now
covered
with
silence
two
centuries
earlier
in
there
had
occurred
one
of
the
most
tremendous
catastrophes
recorded
in
all
the
grim
annals
of
war
after
a
thousand
years
of
primacy
in
the
east
but
twenty
years
after
the
death
of
sardanapalus
the
greek
name
of
asshurbanapal
who
had
carried
his
armies
to
egypt
and
had
made
his
capital
the
centre
of
the
culture
and
magnificence
as
it
was
of
its
cruel
and
hated
power
nineveh
was
captured
buried
and
utterly
desolated
by
a
horde
of
savage
scythians
from
the
mountains
of
the
north
and
east
such
people
as
we
now
call
the
kurds
its
palaces
had
no
lofty
greek
columns
to
stand
for
memorials
as
at
palmyra
or
persepolis
and
when
the
outer
casings
of
brick
and
alabaster
were
cracked
away
and
the
ashes
of
the
upper
stories
and
the
clay
of
the
inner
constructions
soaked
by
the
rains
covered
the
ruins
of
temple
and
palace
nothing
was
left
to
mark
the
site
but
the
hill
no
wonder
that
the
learned
scholar
of
socrates
saw
nothing
knew
nothing
of
the
city
most
glorious
and
most
detested
of
all
the
cities
of
the
earth
but
in
its
day
the
overthrow
of
nineveh
and
the
destruction
of
the
assyrian
empire
had
been
the
most
terrible
event
in
the
world
history
how
the
hebrew
prophets
gloated
over
it
where
now
is
the
den
of
the
lions
and
the
of
the
young
lions
where
the
lion
and
the
lioness
walked
the
whelp
and
none
made
them
afraid
wo
to
the
bloody
city
it
is
all
full
of
lies
and
rapine
the
prey
departeth
not
the
noise
of
the
whip
and
the
noise
of
the
rattling
of
wheels
and
prancing
horses
and
bounding
chariots
the
horsemen
mounting
and
the
flashing
sword
and
the
glittering
spear
and
a
multitude
of
slain
and
a
great
heap
of
corpses
and
there
is
no
end
of
the
bodies
there
is
no
assuaging
of
the
hurt
thy
wound
is
grievous
all
that
hear
the
report
of
thee
clap
their
hands
over
thee
for
upon
whom
hath
not
thy
wickedness
passed
continually
and
another
prophet
had
uttered
the
curse
the
pelican
and
the
porcupine
shall
lodge
in
the
capitals
thereof
their
voice
shall
sound
in
the
windows
desolation
shall
be
in
the
thresholds
for
he
hath
laid
bare
the
this
is
the
joyous
city
that
dwelt
carelessly
that
said
in
her
heart
am
and
there
is
none
besides
me
how
is
she
become
a
desolation
a
place
for
beasts
to
lie
down
in
every
one
that
passeth
by
her
shall
hiss
and
wag
his
hand
thus
fell
nineveh
amid
the
universal
rejoicing
of
the
nations
and
thus
seventy
years
later
fell
babylon
also
which
in
the
short
interval
nebuchadnezzar
had
made
more
magnificent
than
even
nineveh
had
been
beautified
for
its
capture
by
cyrus
but
before
babylon
was
the
capital
of
chaldea
or
nineveh
the
capital
of
assyria
the
city
of
calah
had
been
the
seat
of
its
kings
and
a
mighty
mound
they
call
it
nimroud
now
as
high
as
paul
steeple
old
travellers
loved
to
say
marks
the
place
on
the
east
bank
of
the
tigris
twenty
miles
south
of
nineveh
and
before
calah
assyria
had
an
earlier
capital
forty
miles
still
nearer
the
babylonian
border
at
asshur
now
on
the
west
of
the
tigris
and
each
capital
had
its
palaces
and
records
and
all
are
now
equally
buried
in
clay
and
utter
oblivion
and
before
the
babylon
of
nebuchadnezzar
and
long
centuries
before
nineveh
or
calah
or
asshur
there
had
been
mighty
kingdoms
in
babylonia
of
which
the
world
had
quite
forgot
the
names
only
vague
rumors
remaining
in
song
or
legend
of
nimrod
and
chedorlaomer
and
ur
of
the
chaldees
only
what
was
preserved
in
the
dimmest
records
of
the
hebrew
scriptures
empires
were
lost
buried
in
chiliads
of
forgetfulness
would
they
ever
be
recovered
and
how
much
else
was
lost
what
kingdoms
what
empires
buried
before
hebrew
or
greek
history
began
to
take
notice
of
the
world
outside
and
put
them
in
books
no
one
knew
no
one
knows
even
yet
although
so
much
has
been
found
the
fame
of
egypt
was
never
quite
forgotten
nor
all
its
history
for
egypt
was
the
world
granary
and
closely
accessible
to
the
ships
of
corinth
and
rome
and
egypt
never
lost
her
civilization
in
all
her
long
succession
of
enslavement
but
what
memory
had
been
kept
of
the
ionia
and
greece
of
the
days
before
homer
what
of
the
early
civilization
of
cyprus
and
crete
only
the
name
of
minos
a
judge
in
hell
what
of
persia
and
elam
were
they
uninhabited
before
the
times
of
xerxes
and
cyrus
and
who
were
these
kings
cyrus
and
xerxes
whose
names
burst
upon
us
with
dim
light
out
of
a
black
antiquity
even
they
were
but
shadows
on
a
screen
just
seen
and
disappearing
what
kings
and
kingdoms
came
before
them
and
passed
away
has
history
no
record
not
a
word
only
black
vacuity
has
been
left
behind
them
and
there
was
that
other
empire
of
the
east
that
of
the
hittites
which
we
now
know
ruled
asia
minor
and
syria
and
contested
the
rule
of
the
world
with
assyria
and
egypt
centuries
before
agamemnon
and
achilles
but
so
utterly
buried
and
forgotten
that
not
a
line
of
its
history
was
left
not
even
enough
to
let
the
sharpest
scholar
ask
a
question
or
suspect
that
it
ever
built
capitals
and
fought
victories
and
produced
a
civilization
the
harvest
of
which
we
still
enjoy
nothing
was
left
of
them
but
their
names
in
a
hebrew
list
of
tribes
amorites
and
jebusites
and
hivites
and
hittites
yet
all
these
lost
tribes
nay
lost
nations
had
left
their
records
behind
them
only
they
were
buried
under
ground
and
out
of
sight
what
a
travesty
it
is
on
history
and
civilization
what
an
impeachment
of
the
glory
of
these
later
christian
centuries
that
the
lands
which
these
old
empires
crowded
with
a
busy
population
should
now
be
among
the
most
desolate
and
inaccessible
on
the
face
of
the
earth
there
we
see
the
curse
of
the
moslem
religion
and
still
more
of
the
turkish
government
wherever
the
turk
has
carried
the
sword
and
the
koran
there
is
blight
and
death
only
as
soldiers
and
scholars
of
europe
have
forced
their
way
into
these
seats
of
ancient
empires
has
it
been
possible
to
ask
and
learn
what
is
buried
beneath
their
gray
desolation
the
man
who
did
more
than
any
other
to
awaken
the
interest
of
the
world
in
the
search
for
forgotten
empires
was
sir
henry
layard
the
excavator
of
nineveh
but
before
his
day
another
man
had
startled
the
world
with
what
we
may
call
the
discovery
of
egypt
that
man
was
napoleon
bonaparte
the
man
whose
sword
was
a
ploughshare
turning
up
the
fallow
fields
of
europe
and
sowing
strange
crops
of
tyranny
and
liberty
and
whose
ambition
it
was
to
set
up
a
new
throne
in
the
land
of
the
pharaohs
and
ptolemies
the
mighty
ruins
of
karnak
and
the
imperishable
pyramids
filled
him
with
amazement
and
he
set
the
scholars
of
france
at
work
to
publish
in
massive
folios
the
wonders
of
that
most
ancient
land
then
was
found
the
rosetta
stone
with
its
inscription
in
two
languages
greek
which
any
scholar
could
read
and
the
egyptian
hieroglyphics
which
no
living
man
could
read
but
here
was
the
key
the
words
and
were
in
the
greek
text
and
it
was
not
hard
to
find
what
were
the
combinations
of
characters
that
stood
for
these
words
in
the
egyptian
the
letters
and
were
in
both
names
the
hieroglyphic
signs
found
in
both
names
must
be
these
three
letters
that
beginning
gave
all
the
other
signs
in
both
words
and
the
rest
of
the
alphabet
soon
followed
justly
great
is
the
fame
of
the
frenchman
champollion
who
has
the
honor
of
having
first
deciphered
and
read
this
lost
language
and
opened
to
us
the
secret
treasures
of
its
history
and
religion
but
with
the
exploration
of
egypt
the
scholarship
of
the
world
was
satisfied
for
fifty
years
no
one
seemed
to
think
to
ask
what
might
be
hid
under
the
soil
of
nearer
palestine
and
syria
and
asia
minor
much
less
did
they
seek
to
uncover
the
buried
capitals
of
assyria
and
babylonia
scholarship
was
devoted
to
books
to
old
manuscripts
in
convent
libraries
to
recovering
what
the
wise
men
of
greece
and
rome
had
written
and
trying
to
wrest
new
facts
out
of
their
blundering
old
compilations
of
ancient
history
it
did
not
occur
to
them
that
a
hundred
kings
and
ten
thousand
merchants
and
priests
might
have
left
the
stories
of
their
conquests
or
contracts
or
liturgies
unrotted
in
the
wet
soil
imperishably
preserved
to
be
the
record
of
commerce
and
empires
as
old
and
as
great
as
those
of
egypt
but
far
deeper
covered
with
oblivion
but
there
they
were
kept
safe
for
twenty
thirty
fifty
centuries
until
the
man
should
come
whose
mission
it
was
to
find
them
more
than
one
such
man
came
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
but
one
man
is
and
typical
of
all
the
rest
sir
austen
henry
layard
before
him
one
frenchman
paul
émile
botta
had
made
a
fine
dash
on
a
palace
city
a
dozen
miles
north
of
nineveh
and
had
opened
wonders
such
as
the
world
had
never
seen
before
but
the
man
whose
energy
was
fullest
of
impulse
whose
enthusiasm
compelled
british
ambassadors
and
ministers
and
parliaments
to
do
his
bidding
who
aroused
the
world
to
the
importance
of
the
exploration
and
disinterment
of
the
monuments
of
babylonia
and
assyria
was
the
englishman
layard
he
had
a
youthful
passion
for
adventure
and
slender
means
to
gratify
it
i
wish
you
could
see
him
as
he
is
pictured
in
the
volume
which
gives
the
story
of
his
early
adventures
before
he
had
settled
on
his
of
exploration
there
he
stands
clad
in
his
bakhtiyari
costume
the
dress
of
a
mountain
tribe
in
persia
which
asserted
its
independence
of
teheran
it
is
a
frame
fit
to
endure
hardships
he
stands
holding
the
tall
matchlock
the
curved
scimetar
by
his
side
and
the
long
pistol
and
the
dagger
in
his
belt
above
the
yellow
shoes
and
stockings
a
red
silk
robe
falls
to
his
ankles
and
over
that
a
green
silk
garment
reaches
to
his
knees
and
yet
over
that
a
shorter
and
richly
embroidered
coat
with
open
sleeves
is
held
close
about
the
body
by
a
wide
silken
sash
woven
in
the
brightest
of
red
and
gold
and
holding
the
weapons
attached
to
his
waist
on
his
head
is
a
low
flat
cap
visorless
in
front
but
with
a
broad
bow
in
place
of
a
feather
all
striped
with
the
richest
embroidery
and
with
a
wide
tassel
of
the
same
material
falling
far
down
his
back
but
the
face
with
its
short
beard
dyed
dark
with
henna
and
its
blue
eyes
is
not
that
of
a
warrior
but
of
a
serious
scholar
or
diplomatist
and
he
needed
all
the
force
of
courage
and
all
the
arts
of
diplomacy
for
the
work
he
had
to
do
layard
early
training
was
in
the
line
of
preparation
for
his
work
much
of
his
boyhood
was
spent
in
italy
where
he
acquired
a
taste
for
the
fine
arts
and
as
much
knowledge
of
them
as
a
child
could
obtain
who
was
constantly
in
the
society
of
artists
and
connoisseurs
at
about
the
age
of
sixteen
he
was
sent
to
england
to
study
the
law
for
which
he
was
destined
by
his
parents
after
six
years
in
the
office
of
a
solicitor
and
in
the
chambers
of
an
eminent
conveyancer
for
that
is
the
way
that
lawyers
were
educated
then
he
determined
to
leave
england
and
seek
a
career
elsewhere
he
had
a
relative
in
ceylon
who
gave
him
hopes
of
securing
a
position
there
and
for
ceylon
he
started
a
friend
of
his
ten
years
older
was
bound
for
the
same
destination
both
fond
of
adventure
and
they
agreed
to
go
together
and
to
go
as
far
as
they
could
by
land
instead
of
taking
the
long
sea
journey
around
the
cape
of
good
hope
across
europe
they
passed
to
constantinople
through
austria
dalmatia
montenegro
albania
and
bulgaria
thence
across
asia
minor
to
syria
and
palestine
thence
to
aleppo
and
down
the
tigris
to
baghdad
it
was
an
extraordinary
and
adventurous
journey
often
dangerous
but
greater
danger
was
to
follow
layard
had
learned
some
turkish
and
now
he
spent
the
long
weeks
in
baghdad
in
the
study
of
persian
his
companion
was
quite
familiar
with
arabic
before
they
left
england
they
had
received
good
advice
from
sir
john
macneill
the
british
representative
at
the
court
of
the
shah
you
must
either
travel
as
important
personages
with
a
retinue
of
servants
and
an
adequate
escort
or
alone
as
poor
men
with
nothing
to
excite
the
cupidity
of
the
people
amongst
whom
you
will
have
to
mix
if
you
can
not
afford
to
adopt
the
first
course
you
must
take
the
latter
the
latter
they
were
forced
to
take
many
a
young
man
has
the
gift
to
acquire
languages
almost
any
oriental
can
talk
three
or
four
and
the
ability
to
rough
it
and
live
on
the
fare
of
the
people
though
barbarous
and
many
a
man
has
the
spirit
of
adventure
but
this
young
man
had
one
peculiar
and
unusual
qualification
that
directed
him
to
his
future
career
as
a
child
he
had
read
the
arabian
nights
with
intense
delight
with
their
stories
centred
about
baghdad
then
every
book
of
eastern
adventure
every
bit
of
travel
in
syria
arabia
or
persia
that
he
could
find
he
had
eagerly
devoured
it
was
his
day
and
night
longing
that
he
might
visit
strange
lands
of
history
and
make
explorations
and
discoveries
so
wherever
he
was
he
visited
every
ruin
and
tried
to
copy
every
inscription
if
his
companion
would
not
turn
aside
to
visit
some
region
of
renown
and
danger
he
would
go
alone
and
join
him
later
as
they
came
down
the
river
tigris
in
their
boat
they
passed
the
immense
mound
of
nimroud
and
so
impressed
was
layard
by
it
that
he
then
scarce
years
old
resolved
that
some
day
he
would
search
and
learn
what
was
hidden
under
it
but
little
did
he
imagine
what
wonderful
monuments
he
was
to
find
there
only
a
few
years
later
without
a
servant
as
poor
men
in
a
caravan
of
fanatical
and
hostile
persian
pilgrims
returning
from
the
shrines
just
travellers
trying
to
go
by
land
through
persia
and
afghanistan
to
india
and
ceylon
they
left
baghdad
it
was
a
time
of
unusual
danger
for
the
british
minister
had
been
recalled
from
the
persian
court
and
war
with
england
was
threatened
they
were
taken
for
spies
and
sent
to
the
presence
of
the
shah
and
forbidden
to
follow
the
route
they
had
chosen
and
which
had
been
marked
out
for
them
by
the
council
of
the
royal
geographical
society
to
report
on
rivers
and
mountains
and
ruins
not
yet
explored
they
were
insulted
and
robbed
and
their
lives
were
often
in
danger
but
at
last
they
received
from
the
shah
their
firmans
now
they
separated
his
companion
felt
that
he
must
go
by
the
quickest
route
to
his
destination
but
layard
had
no
definite
date
before
him
and
he
was
anxious
to
perform
the
commissions
of
the
geographical
society
and
so
he
plunged
alone
into
fresh
dangers
but
there
is
no
space
to
tell
the
rest
of
the
story
of
his
adventures
among
the
bakhtiyari
of
his
copying
of
inscriptions
of
his
return
to
baghdad
and
his
decision
to
give
up
the
plans
of
life
in
ceylon
and
of
his
return
from
baghdad
again
to
shuster
and
persepolis
and
other
ancient
cities
of
persia
and
his
exploration
of
the
karun
river
and
his
geographical
paper
on
the
subject
his
opening
of
british
trade
and
his
return
to
constantinople
at
mosul
he
found
that
botta
was
planning
to
explore
the
mounds
across
the
tigris
that
covered
ancient
nineveh
and
he
warmly
encouraged
his
plans
at
constantinople
he
visited
sir
stratford
canning
and
delivered
to
him
despatches
that
had
been
confided
to
his
care
in
view
of
a
threatened
war
between
persia
and
turkey
here
he
was
kept
in
the
service
of
the
british
embassy
and
intrusted
with
important
and
delicate
negotiations
and
investigations
which
were
so
highly
appreciated
by
sir
stratford
that
he
kept
him
as
his
attaché
meanwhile
botta
had
begun
his
excavations
of
a
palace
of
king
sargon
at
khorsabad
and
was
sending
his
reports
and
drawings
to
paris
they
were
all
sent
by
way
of
constantinople
and
by
botta
generosity
were
all
seen
by
layard
so
deeply
was
he
interested
in
them
and
so
intense
was
his
desire
to
carry
on
excavations
himself
that
he
secured
his
release
from
the
embassy
and
also
a
grant
of
three
hundred
dollars
from
sir
stratford
own
purse
which
with
what
he
could
spare
from
his
own
money
would
he
hoped
suffice
to
begin
the
work
when
if
anything
of
value
appeared
it
was
trusted
that
funds
would
be
secured
from
english
friends
of
oriental
learning
thus
six
years
after
leaving
england
layard
well
equipped
in
knowledge
of
the
people
and
in
diplomatic
experience
was
ready
to
launch
on
his
great
career
which
brought
him
fame
and
earned
him
the
post
in
later
years
of
british
ambassador
at
the
porte
which
sir
stratford
had
held
and
what
is
far
greater
gave
to
the
world
the
larger
part
of
its
knowledge
of
the
lost
empires
of
assyria
and
babylonia
with
these
few
hundred
dollars
and
contributing
every
penny
of
his
own
income
in
october
of
he
left
constantinople
without
companion
or
servant
went
by
steamer
to
samsoun
and
then
as
fast
as
could
climb
or
gallop
over
mountains
and
plains
he
reached
mosul
in
twelve
days
here
at
last
he
was
fitted
for
his
task
supplied
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
passion
the
arabs
say
i
had
a
horse
but
no
desert
i
had
a
desert
but
no
horse
now
i
have
a
desert
and
a
horse
and
shall
i
not
ride
his
boyhood
with
the
artists
of
italy
and
learning
the
languages
of
the
continent
had
fitted
him
for
his
task
then
his
study
of
all
the
books
of
eastern
travel
then
half
a
year
wandering
with
a
trained
companion
through
asia
minor
and
syria
scarcely
leaving
untrod
one
spot
hallowed
by
tradition
or
unvisited
one
ruin
consecrated
by
history
with
no
protection
but
his
arms
living
with
the
people
and
learning
their
prejudices
and
customs
then
an
irresistible
desire
had
brought
him
to
the
regions
beyond
the
euphrates
and
the
mystery
of
assyria
babylonia
and
chaldea
had
fascinated
him
so
that
he
had
visited
the
land
of
nimrod
seen
the
site
of
their
old
buried
capitals
had
been
the
guest
in
the
tents
of
shammar
and
aneyzah
arabs
and
even
passed
on
to
see
the
famous
forty
columns
of
chilminar
old
persian
persepolis
and
to
penetrate
the
mountain
fastnesses
where
the
bakhtiyari
maintained
a
perilous
freedom
never
was
man
better
trained
by
enthusiasm
and
experience
for
his
task
and
the
late
discoveries
of
botta
had
inflamed
his
desire
to
surpass
what
his
french
friend
had
done
his
plan
was
not
to
begin
excavations
at
nineveh
opposite
mosul
but
twenty
miles
south
at
the
great
mound
of
nimroud
which
bore
the
name
of
the
mighty
hunter
nimrod
xenophon
and
his
ten
thousand
had
seen
and
wondered
at
its
pyramid
there
he
would
be
free
from
the
army
of
mischievous
spectators
that
would
swarm
from
mosul
had
he
selected
the
site
of
nineveh
and
from
the
constant
interference
of
the
turkish
governor
the
pasha
at
mosul
was
a
cruel
scoundrel
who
was
robbing
and
killing
the
people
as
his
whim
or
greed
prompted
and
had
reduced
the
tribes
of
the
neighborhood
to
a
state
of
terror
accordingly
layard
who
was
armed
with
protecting
letters
from
the
british
ambassador
and
the
porte
thought
it
wise
to
conceal
his
purpose
let
it
be
reported
that
he
was
going
on
a
hunting
expedition
and
with
a
few
tools
and
a
supply
of
guns
and
spears
on
the
of
november
accompanied
only
by
his
cawass
the
soldier
attendant
detailed
for
the
protection
of
travellers
a
servant
and
one
laborer
he
floated
down
the
tigris
and
in
four
hours
reached
the
bourne
of
his
long
hopes
he
had
the
mound
he
had
the
money
and
now
he
would
dig
the
arabs
have
strange
stories
of
this
ruin
the
palace
they
say
was
built
by
athur
the
vizier
of
nimrod
there
abraham
brake
in
pieces
the
idols
worshipped
by
the
unbelievers
nimrod
was
angry
and
waged
war
on
the
holy
patriarch
abraham
prayed
to
god
deliver
me
o
god
from
this
man
who
worships
stones
and
boasts
himself
to
be
lord
of
all
kings
and
god
said
to
him
how
shall
i
punish
him
and
the
prophet
answered
to
thee
armies
are
as
nothing
and
the
strength
and
power
of
men
likewise
before
the
smallest
of
thy
creatures
will
they
perish
and
god
was
pleased
at
the
faith
of
his
servant
and
he
sent
a
gnat
that
vexed
nimrod
day
and
night
so
that
he
built
himself
a
room
of
glass
in
that
palace
that
he
might
dwell
therein
and
shut
out
the
insect
but
the
gnat
entered
also
and
passed
by
his
ear
into
his
brain
upon
which
it
fed
and
increased
day
by
day
so
that
the
servants
of
nimrod
beat
his
head
continually
with
a
mallet
that
he
might
have
some
ease
from
his
pain
but
he
died
after
suffering
these
torments
four
hundred
years
and
after
him
the
mound
was
named
nimroud
it
was
dark
when
layard
and
his
little
company
reached
the
place
they
found
near
by
a
few
huts
occupied
by
poor
arabs
who
had
been
harried
by
the
turkish
pasha
there
they
slept
or
tried
to
sleep
but
the
explorer
could
not
sleep
hear
him
hopes
long
cherished
were
now
to
be
realized
or
were
to
end
in
disappointment
visions
of
palaces
under
ground
of
gigantic
monsters
of
sculptured
figures
and
endless
inscriptions
floated
before
me
after
forming
plan
after
plan
for
removing
the
earth
and
extricating
these
treasures
i
fancied
myself
wandering
in
a
maze
of
chambers
from
which
i
could
find
no
outlet
then
again
all
was
reburied
and
i
was
standing
on
the
mound
exhausted
i
was
at
length
sinking
into
sleep
when
hearing
the
voice
of
awad
i
rose
from
my
carpet
and
joined
him
outside
the
tent
the
day
already
dawned
the
lofty
cone
and
broad
mound
of
nimroud
broke
like
a
distant
mountain
on
the
morning
sky
awad
his
host
was
a
little
chief
among
the
arabs
and
was
engaged
to
take
charge
of
the
diggers
the
first
morning
he
had
six
arabs
at
work
and
found
alabaster
slabs
with
cuneiform
inscriptions
he
was
now
sure
he
would
succeed
it
is
not
necessary
to
give
the
diary
of
his
work
to
be
sure
the
villanous
pasha
forbade
him
to
continue
and
recalled
him
to
mosul
but
a
new
governor
was
sent
from
constantinople
under
whom
he
had
no
difficulty
a
great
palace
had
been
found
and
chamber
after
chamber
was
excavated
the
walls
covered
with
and
inscriptions
then
came
strange
gigantic
lions
with
human
heads
that
had
been
placed
by
the
old
assyrian
king
to
guard
the
entrances
to
his
court
what
was
the
amazement
of
the
arabs
and
turks
can
not
be
told
first
the
head
was
uncovered
it
stood
out
from
the
earth
placid
and
vast
hear
layard
tell
the
story
he
had
been
away
to
visit
a
neighboring
chief
i
was
returning
to
the
mound
when
i
saw
two
arabs
urging
their
mares
to
the
top
of
their
speed
o
bey
exclaimed
one
of
them
to
the
diggers
for
they
have
found
nimrod
himself
by
allah
it
is
wonderful
but
it
is
true
we
have
seen
him
with
our
eyes
there
is
no
god
but
god
and
both
joining
in
this
pious
exclamation
they
galloped
back
to
the
tent
layard
hastened
to
the
trench
and
there
saw
what
he
knew
to
be
the
head
of
a
gigantic
lion
or
bull
such
as
botta
had
uncovered
at
khorsabad
it
was
in
admirable
preservation
the
expression
was
calm
yet
majestic
and
the
outline
of
the
features
showed
a
freedom
and
knowledge
of
art
that
was
scarcely
to
be
looked
for
at
so
early
a
period
says
the
explorer
i
was
not
surprised
that
the
arabs
had
been
amazed
and
terrified
at
this
apparition
it
required
no
stretch
of
imagination
to
conjure
up
the
most
strange
fancies
this
gigantic
head
blanched
with
age
thus
rising
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
might
well
have
belonged
to
one
of
those
fearful
beings
which
are
pictured
in
the
traditions
of
the
country
as
appearing
to
mortals
slowly
ascending
from
the
regions
below
is
not
the
work
of
men
hands
exclaimed
sheikh
abdurrahman
who
had
galloped
to
the
mound
on
the
first
news
of
those
infidel
giants
of
whom
the
prophet
peace
be
with
him
has
said
that
they
were
higher
than
the
tallest
this
is
one
of
the
idols
which
noah
peace
be
with
him
cursed
before
the
flood
in
this
opinion
all
the
bystanders
concurred
the
arabs
have
a
ready
explanation
for
every
fresh
discovery
when
some
years
later
layard
assistant
and
successor
in
the
work
of
excavation
rassam
uncovered
at
a
remarkable
with
the
figure
of
the
seated
and
three
approaching
worshippers
the
arab
diggers
rushed
to
him
declaring
that
they
had
found
noah
and
his
three
sons
shem
ham
and
japhet
and
demanded
a
sheep
to
make
a
feast
the
report
of
the
wonderful
discovery
of
a
royal
palace
evidently
older
than
those
of
nineveh
with
magnificent
decorations
in
alabaster
and
cuneiform
inscriptions
reached
beyond
mosul
to
constantinople
sir
stratford
canning
was
delighted
with
the
result
of
his
expedition
he
had
a
passion
for
discovery
as
well
as
diplomacy
and
it
is
to
him
that
the
british
museum
is
indebted
for
the
priceless
marbles
of
halicarnassus
he
now
obtained
for
layard
a
firman
permitting
him
to
make
what
excavations
he
wished
then
the
news
reached
london
and
the
british
museum
made
a
grant
to
support
the
work
all
difficulties
were
now
removed
conditions
were
even
more
favorable
for
him
than
they
are
now
there
was
then
no
imperial
museum
in
constantinople
to
which
all
objects
found
must
be
taken
but
those
that
dug
had
the
right
to
carry
off
their
prizes
to
london
or
paris
to
tell
the
story
of
the
further
excavations
is
unnecessary
it
is
all
given
in
layard
two
splendid
volumes
nineveh
and
its
remains
and
babylon
and
nineveh
and
the
statues
bronzes
ivories
and
inscriptions
are
magnificently
reproduced
in
great
folio
volumes
from
nimroud
he
went
back
to
mosul
and
there
opened
the
two
mounds
opposite
of
kuyunjik
and
the
site
of
old
nineveh
there
more
palaces
and
friezes
were
found
of
other
kings
then
he
went
back
to
london
closing
his
successful
campaign
more
profitable
if
not
more
glorious
than
those
of
war
and
published
the
story
of
his
work
its
effect
was
marvellous
no
such
popular
book
of
travels
had
ever
appeared
for
it
was
a
story
of
adventure
and
also
of
strange
discovery
layard
had
not
suspected
that
he
had
the
literary
gift
but
he
had
it
in
rare
measure
he
had
gained
an
inner
view
of
the
heart
of
tribes
moslem
and
christian
and
by
his
sympathy
with
them
and
his
knowledge
of
their
tongues
he
had
lived
in
their
tents
and
huts
he
had
saved
them
from
persecution
by
turkish
governors
their
gratitude
to
him
was
beyond
words
and
he
told
their
story
with
affection
and
enthusiasm
then
his
discoveries
were
in
the
lands
made
historic
not
only
by
the
campaigns
of
xenophon
and
alexander
but
made
almost
sacred
by
the
bible
history
these
were
the
lands
whence
came
the
armies
that
fought
with
israel
these
were
the
kings
whose
wars
are
told
in
the
jewish
records
and
the
annals
of
these
kings
were
found
in
their
palaces
and
they
gave
full
accounts
of
wars
of
which
the
bible
had
given
the
outline
piety
and
learning
joined
to
give
extraordinary
interest
to
these
discoveries
and
to
this
report
of
them
layard
found
himself
famous
and
the
monuments
he
was
bringing
to
the
british
museum
were
and
still
are
the
most
extraordinary
and
fascinating
in
all
its
corridors
of
course
a
new
grant
was
made
in
behalf
of
the
british
museum
and
of
course
he
went
back
to
continue
and
extend
his
researches
now
he
wished
to
go
further
south
beyond
nimroud
to
kalah
shergat
the
yet
earlier
capital
of
assyria
and
yet
further
to
babylon
that
he
might
see
and
test
the
multitude
of
mounds
of
ancient
chaldea
the
real
land
of
nimrod
the
seat
of
eden
and
the
tower
of
babel
far
more
ancient
than
any
one
of
the
three
capitals
of
assyria
while
he
did
scarce
more
than
to
visit
and
report
on
the
babylonian
mounds
his
diggings
in
nineveh
itself
were
of
vast
importance
for
there
he
found
the
library
of
asshurbanabal
on
clay
tablets
which
has
given
us
our
chief
knowledge
of
the
literature
and
learning
of
the
ancient
east
in
he
returned
to
england
to
publish
his
monuments
of
nineveh
and
left
the
further
exploration
to
his
able
lieutenant
rassam
and
to
a
noble
succession
of
explorers
who
should
follow
and
to
a
no
less
noble
line
of
scholars
who
should
interpret
the
inscriptions
and
recover
the
history
of
the
nations
so
that
we
now
know
more
exactly
the
history
of
babylonian
and
assyrian
kings
and
from
more
authentic
records
and
more
completely
the
social
condition
and
business
life
of
the
countries
than
we
do
the
history
of
greece
or
the
life
of
the
greeks
even
of
the
time
of
pericles
and
that
too
for
a
period
of
three
thousand
years
to
illustrate
this
fact
let
us
take
the
black
obelisk
of
shalmaneser
found
by
layard
at
nimroud
it
is
a
column
of
basalt
seven
feet
high
and
about
two
feet
wide
at
the
base
from
which
it
narrows
slightly
until
near
the
top
it
is
reduced
by
three
steps
on
the
four
sides
is
engraved
in
five
rows
of
twenty
in
all
the
pictured
history
of
the
royal
conquests
the
submission
of
kings
and
the
presentation
of
tribute
above
and
below
and
between
in
two
hundred
and
ten
lines
was
cut
an
inscription
which
explained
the
figures
and
gave
a
full
historical
and
of
course
contemporary
and
official
account
of
the
glorious
events
of
the
royal
reign
not
a
line
was
defaced
at
the
british
museum
it
can
be
seen
as
perfect
as
when
engraved
centuries
ago
other
monuments
of
shalmaneser
have
been
found
one
is
a
great
monolith
with
a
portrait
of
the
king
in
all
his
fine
array
and
with
one
hundred
and
lines
of
text
another
is
a
series
of
splendid
bronze
plates
that
covered
great
wooden
gates
on
which
in
repoussé
work
were
pictures
of
the
royal
victories
and
inscriptions
explaining
them
the
bible
tells
us
of
the
rivalries
and
jealousies
of
ahab
and
jehu
kings
of
israel
and
benhadad
and
hazael
kings
of
damascus
how
surprising
it
is
to
find
here
not
only
the
story
of
the
successive
campaigns
of
shalmaneser
against
these
same
kings
the
number
of
their
chariots
and
soldiers
but
to
see
pictured
before
us
the
tribute
sent
by
jehu
we
learn
that
shalmaneser
reigned
from
to
and
we
have
the
record
of
all
his
successive
campaigns
the
first
of
which
he
led
in
person
there
is
not
another
country
of
which
before
the
invention
of
printing
we
have
so
minute
a
history
and
all
had
been
lost
except
the
mention
of
a
name
or
two
whether
historical
or
legendary
we
hardly
knew
until
layard
and
his
opened
the
mounds
of
assyria
but
enough
for
layard
he
is
only
one
though
the
principal
one
of
all
the
explorers
of
the
buried
records
of
the
empires
of
the
tigris
and
euphrates
and
babylonia
and
assyria
are
not
the
only
countries
that
history
required
us
to
explore
greece
and
its
neighboring
states
and
islands
have
not
even
yet
been
fairly
investigated
much
of
asia
minor
is
still
a
virgin
field
syria
and
palestine
have
hardly
been
scratched
with
the
spade
more
has
been
done
in
egypt
but
more
yet
is
to
be
done
and
when
we
go
into
the
further
east
of
persia
and
old
elam
not
to
speak
of
the
yet
farther
east
of
central
asia
now
just
beginning
to
yield
strange
treasures
to
daring
travellers
and
ancient
india
and
china
how
ancient
we
know
not
at
all
there
is
field
for
centuries
of
further
research
for
we
must
go
back
past
empires
and
kingdoms
and
tribal
conditions
to
the
very
beginning
of
the
human
race
on
the
earth
even
if
so
it
be
to
the
first
which
men
of
science
tell
us
was
the
link
which
connected
with
the
race
of
primitive
simians
and
all
this
it
may
well
be
is
preserved
in
undecaying
records
just
a
few
feet
under
the
ground
if
one
only
knew
where
to
dig
for
it
nay
we
now
know
where
to
dig
for
the
most
and
best
of
it
and
we
only
await
the
stratford
cannings
who
will
give
the
money
and
the
austen
layards
who
have
the
enthusiasm
for
the
work
after
layard
and
rassam
after
rawlinson
and
botta
george
smith
took
flying
trips
to
the
site
of
nineveh
twice
that
he
might
gather
the
remaining
fragments
of
the
great
library
of
asshurbanabal
and
he
died
in
the
field
far
from
home
it
was
he
that
found
among
layard
tablets
the
babylonian
account
of
the
deluge
so
much
like
that
in
the
bible
he
was
the
first
of
a
second
generation
who
following
rawlinson
and
oppert
decipherers
as
well
as
explorers
were
able
to
read
as
they
found
i
can
only
mention
the
names
of
the
englishmen
taylor
and
loftus
of
the
frenchmen
place
and
de
sarzec
and
later
the
americans
peters
hilprecht
and
haynes
who
have
so
faithfully
explored
the
extremely
archaic
mound
of
niffer
which
i
had
the
honor
to
recommend
for
excavation
after
i
had
visited
the
mounds
of
southern
babylonia
in
the
winter
of
and
now
the
germans
with
scientific
as
well
as
commercial
and
political
purpose
with
their
railroad
to
pass
down
the
valley
through
baghdad
to
the
persian
gulf
which
gives
them
predominant
influence
have
sent
expeditions
well
equipped
with
scholars
and
engineers
to
the
choicest
sites
in
babylonia
to
warka
the
ancient
erech
and
to
babylon
itself
and
with
teuton
thoroughness
they
are
excavating
the
most
famous
of
ancient
ruins
and
gathering
fresh
treasures
of
archaeological
research
nor
have
they
left
the
land
of
the
hittites
unexplored
for
germany
claims
the
first
rights
politically
in
all
anatolia
the
right
of
succession
and
possession
when
the
turk
is
expelled
and
german
archaeological
science
is
bound
to
be
first
on
that
field
and
now
what
have
we
found
as
the
fruit
of
all
this
labor
of
exploration
is
it
worth
the
labor
and
the
expense
let
us
look
first
it
can
be
only
a
glance
at
egypt
for
egypt
was
the
land
first
and
most
persistently
explored
the
french
government
for
scores
of
years
has
been
at
work
there
germans
and
italians
have
explored
the
ruins
two
english
societies
have
for
years
kept
expeditions
in
the
field
and
just
now
a
californian
university
sends
an
american
egyptologist
to
uncover
the
tombs
and
read
the
hieroglyphs
of
the
kings
not
only
are
the
figured
monuments
of
egypt
published
in
princely
folios
but
its
records
have
been
translated
and
its
lost
history
recovered
to
the
world
knowledge
instead
of
the
bare
pharaoh
of
the
bible
a
common
designation
for
all
the
kings
and
in
place
of
a
bare
list
of
names
and
dynasties
copied
from
manetho
and
so
altered
and
corrupted
in
the
copying
as
to
be
neither
greek
nor
egyptian
we
have
on
scarab
or
gravestone
or
pyramid
or
wall
in
his
own
spelling
the
name
of
almost
every
king
from
the
latest
time
of
the
ptolemies
back
to
the
first
king
of
the
first
dynasty
five
thousand
or
was
it
six
thousand
years
before
christ
and
not
their
names
only
but
the
very
pictures
of
their
wars
we
see
how
they
went
up
the
nile
and
fought
the
blacks
of
abyssinia
and
brought
back
the
spoils
of
punt
we
see
them
sending
their
squadrons
into
syrian
asia
and
waging
a
dubious
battle
with
the
hittites
before
the
walls
of
hamath
where
rameses
in
his
chariot
performs
prodigies
of
valor
and
from
which
he
returns
not
only
to
paint
on
sacred
walls
the
picture
of
his
victory
but
also
to
inscribe
a
copy
of
the
treaty
of
peace
with
the
hittite
king
the
earliest
treaty
in
the
preserved
annals
of
diplomacy
well
wrought
that
rameses
the
great
for
eternal
fame
in
the
sixty
years
of
his
reign
fifteen
centuries
before
the
birth
of
our
lord
but
what
fame
had
been
his
had
not
explorers
and
excavators
and
scholars
dug
and
found
and
copied
and
translated
what
the
sands
had
covered
for
centuries
and
the
curious
traveller
stops
in
sight
of
the
pyramids
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
enters
the
bulaq
museum
and
there
he
sees
set
up
before
him
the
very
mummy
of
rameses
himself
and
of
a
dozen
other
royal
personages
rifled
from
their
tombs
and
displayed
for
your
amazement
and
mine
there
is
the
very
pharaoh
you
can
see
his
features
you
can
touch
his
coffin
who
chased
the
children
of
israel
out
of
egypt
there
are
the
household
implements
the
furniture
of
their
homes
the
jewelry
their
queens
wore
queens
who
were
also
sisters
of
the
kings
as
sarah
was
the
sister
of
abraham
or
would
you
know
of
some
great
revolution
in
egypt
these
decipherers
of
the
inscriptions
will
tell
you
how
the
shepherd
kings
overthrew
the
native
dynasty
coming
with
their
armies
from
asia
long
before
rameses
and
changed
religion
and
customs
under
whom
jacob
and
his
sons
found
hospitable
welcome
until
their
hated
race
was
expelled
by
a
stronger
native
dynasty
that
knew
not
joseph
or
they
will
tell
you
of
the
royal
reformer
khuenaten
son
of
a
famous
eastern
mother
a
queen
from
the
banks
of
the
euphrates
taught
by
her
perhaps
a
purer
religion
he
attempted
to
replace
the
worship
of
egypt
bestial
gods
by
the
worship
of
the
one
only
great
god
whose
symbol
was
the
sun
but
the
priestly
clan
was
too
strong
for
him
and
the
succeeding
pharaohs
destroyed
his
records
and
chiselled
out
his
name
where
it
had
been
cut
in
stone
that
no
memory
of
his
sacrilege
might
be
preserved
a
royal
moses
there
could
not
be
the
worshipper
of
one
god
whether
king
or
son
of
daughter
could
bring
no
reformation
to
egypt
or
would
you
learn
how
egypt
ruled
its
subject
territory
you
can
read
the
correspondence
of
a
dozen
local
egyptian
governors
in
palestine
and
syria
in
the
century
before
moses
led
the
hebrew
slaves
out
of
egypt
there
is
the
letter
of
the
king
of
jerusalem
where
melchizedek
reigned
in
the
times
of
abraham
and
they
tell
of
rebellions
against
the
fading
power
of
egypt
and
of
the
fear
of
the
advancing
hittites
the
earliest
kings
those
that
built
the
pyramids
appear
before
us
real
in
their
personality
emerging
out
of
misty
legend
or
myth
and
earlier
still
even
the
prehistoric
races
that
antedated
the
very
beginning
of
civilization
whence
came
that
first
dynasty
who
invented
writing
were
they
autochthons
hardly
these
are
questions
left
for
further
explorers
to
answer
probably
those
first
messengers
of
civilization
came
from
the
east
perhaps
from
arabia
perhaps
from
babylonia
or
perhaps
the
first
babylonians
and
egyptians
formed
a
common
stock
somewhere
near
the
mouth
of
the
euphrates
perhaps
the
bible
is
right
in
saying
that
the
first
seat
of
civilized
man
was
in
eden
and
that
the
euphrates
was
the
chief
river
of
paradise
or
was
it
from
arabia
the
immemorial
home
of
the
semitic
tribes
that
land
of
sand
and
mountain
and
fertile
valley
land
of
changeless
culture
and
tradition
so
near
the
centres
of
civilization
and
yet
still
the
most
inaccessible
the
least
known
portion
of
the
inhabited
earth
was
it
from
arabia
that
the
wiser
stronger
multitude
came
that
first
overran
the
valleys
of
both
the
nile
and
the
euphrates
bringing
to
egypt
and
chaldea
arts
and
letters
we
do
not
know
some
future
explorer
must
teach
us
but
the
german
glaser
has
within
these
few
years
brought
back
from
hazardous
journeys
a
multitude
of
inscriptions
that
tell
of
kingdoms
that
fringed
its
southern
coast
and
extended
we
know
not
how
far
into
the
interior
in
those
early
days
when
one
of
the
queens
of
sheba
brought
presents
to
solomon
and
when
earlier
still
we
are
told
there
were
dukes
of
edom
before
there
was
any
king
in
israel
they
say
that
a
railroad
is
to
be
built
to
mecca
arabia
is
not
to
be
always
a
closed
land
neighbor
as
it
is
to
egypt
we
shall
know
one
of
these
days
whether
as
scholars
suspect
out
of
arabia
and
across
the
straits
of
where
at
the
southern
end
of
the
red
sea
africa
almost
touches
asia
there
came
that
mighty
flood
of
more
forceful
men
bred
in
the
deserts
and
hills
who
passing
down
the
nile
first
brought
history
to
egypt
and
whether
it
was
this
same
semitic
people
as
scholars
suspect
again
that
spread
resistlessly
eastward
to
the
euphrates
valley
and
did
an
equal
service
in
conquering
and
assimilating
the
black
aborigines
of
these
swamps
and
lagoons
the
spade
will
tell
us
or
was
it
still
further
east
in
the
highlands
of
persia
that
men
first
learned
how
to
write
and
record
history
we
can
not
go
back
so
far
in
the
history
of
babylonia
professor
hilprecht
dares
to
carry
us
seven
thousand
years
before
christ
that
we
do
not
find
its
kings
fighting
against
elam
and
only
in
the
last
decade
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
frenchman
de
morgan
has
made
marvellous
discoveries
in
the
elamite
lands
what
a
noble
passion
those
frenchmen
have
for
discovery
for
egypt
did
not
napoleon
provide
the
most
elephantine
books
of
monuments
and
records
that
have
yet
issued
and
from
that
time
to
this
have
not
frenchmen
held
the
primacy
in
excavations
until
even
while
england
holds
and
rules
egypt
she
leaves
by
special
convention
the
care
of
its
monuments
and
their
exploration
to
french
savants
and
before
layard
removed
a
basketful
of
the
earth
that
covered
the
palace
of
shalmaneser
at
nimroud
had
not
the
frenchman
botta
disclosed
the
friezes
and
sphinxes
of
sargon
at
khorsabad
and
in
these
late
years
is
it
not
the
frenchman
de
sarzec
who
has
brought
from
telloh
to
the
louvre
the
statues
of
chaldean
kings
that
lived
almost
five
thousand
years
ago
and
so
to
france
was
given
the
right
for
the
honor
and
enrichment
of
the
louvre
to
explore
persia
and
de
morgan
went
to
susa
to
shushan
the
palace
of
xerxes
and
darius
of
ahasuerus
and
esther
in
search
of
what
was
far
earlier
than
they
for
another
frenchman
and
his
wife
and
mme
dieulafoy
had
already
excavated
the
noble
palace
of
these
persian
kings
far
below
the
palace
of
xerxes
he
has
found
vastly
earlier
remains
there
is
the
column
set
up
if
we
can
believe
the
assyriologists
who
trust
the
chronology
of
nabonidus
the
last
king
of
babylon
and
it
is
not
incredible
three
thousand
eight
hundred
years
before
christ
by
a
babylonian
king
to
commemorate
one
of
his
raids
into
the
land
of
what
were
perhaps
his
stronger
enemies
it
is
a
noble
composition
with
archaic
writing
and
a
stately
figure
of
the
king
climbing
the
mountains
and
slaying
his
enemies
it
shows
an
art
that
might
well
have
developed
into
the
best
that
greece
has
produced
but
de
morgan
has
only
begun
to
scratch
the
surface
of
the
mounds
of
elam
and
a
multitude
of
scholars
believe
that
out
of
elam
came
the
first
civilization
of
chaldea
we
shall
find
out
yet
for
the
record
is
in
the
earth
and
only
waits
the
man
who
will
dig
it
out
and
then
the
man
who
will
read
it
we
are
tempted
to
go
further
east
and
recall
that
in
india
the
land
where
alexander
made
his
most
distant
conquests
a
multitude
of
english
scholars
have
been
searching
the
ruins
of
old
temples
for
the
earliest
memorials
of
the
worship
of
buddha
just
now
they
have
found
his
birthplace
and
precious
relics
but
that
takes
us
too
far
afield
and
would
tempt
us
to
further
excursions
in
burmah
and
china
we
must
come
back
to
western
asia
and
the
shores
of
europe
as
has
been
indicated
the
greatest
puzzle
of
ancient
history
is
that
of
the
hittite
empire
which
seems
to
have
ruled
all
asia
minor
at
some
uncertain
time
and
to
have
extended
over
syria
and
palestine
no
sooner
had
the
greatest
egyptian
kings
thothmes
and
rameses
ventured
their
armies
into
asia
perhaps
in
vengeance
on
the
incursions
of
ionian
pirates
perhaps
in
requital
of
the
tyrannies
of
the
hated
shepherd
kings
than
they
learned
of
the
hittites
on
the
shores
of
the
euphrates
then
a
century
or
two
later
a
mass
of
official
correspondence
sent
by
the
kings
of
palestine
and
syria
dug
up
in
egypt
reports
that
the
hittites
had
appeared
as
invaders
from
the
north
and
beseeches
military
aid
but
the
power
of
egypt
had
waned
and
the
hittites
were
supreme
until
the
assyrians
began
and
carried
on
for
five
centuries
the
uncertain
war
which
ended
in
the
utter
overthrow
of
the
hittites
and
all
their
allies
in
a
great
battle
at
carchemish
that
great
mound
of
carchemish
needs
to
be
thoroughly
explored
already
an
english
expedition
has
very
carelessly
just
opened
the
hill
and
exposed
but
not
fairly
published
some
few
as
fine
friezes
as
are
to
be
found
in
the
assyrian
capitals
with
unread
hittite
inscriptions
and
a
fine
statue
of
the
hittite
venus
but
much
remains
to
reward
the
student
of
oriental
history
and
art
at
senjirli
a
german
expedition
under
von
luschan
has
done
more
and
better
work
handsomely
published
but
this
was
a
smaller
syrian
town
and
less
was
to
be
expected
and
yet
here
and
near
by
were
found
what
was
not
expected
steles
upright
slabs
or
pillars
with
the
portraits
of
kings
in
high
relief
covered
over
with
long
inscriptions
in
aramaic
the
oldest
and
longest
as
yet
discovered
anywhere
in
that
language
it
was
a
magnificent
result
of
very
moderate
labor
hittite
friezes
assyrian
and
aramean
inscriptions
all
in
one
little
mound
but
for
the
most
part
we
know
the
art
and
writing
of
the
hittites
from
what
we
have
found
above
ground
in
their
towns
and
fortresses
in
the
hills
for
little
digging
has
been
done
at
pterium
was
a
principal
sacred
capital
and
there
on
a
natural
corridor
of
rock
they
carved
a
procession
of
gods
and
kings
and
soldiers
that
excites
the
wonder
of
scholars
as
i
write
the
announcement
comes
that
professor
sayce
has
at
last
discovered
the
secret
of
the
hittite
hieroglyphs
and
we
may
hope
that
very
soon
it
will
be
possible
to
read
them
but
there
is
vastly
more
of
their
records
yet
to
be
disinterred
and
there
remain
the
two
lands
most
sacred
and
beloved
in
poetry
and
history
the
land
of
israel
and
the
land
of
homer
it
is
amazing
that
so
little
search
has
been
made
to
find
out
what
is
hidden
under
the
soil
of
palestine
scholars
in
plenty
have
walked
over
the
top
of
it
and
have
told
all
that
is
on
the
surface
but
almost
nothing
has
been
done
underground
no
such
excavations
as
in
egypt
or
assyria
i
do
not
forget
that
the
english
palestine
exploration
fund
has
followed
out
with
trenches
and
tunnels
the
walls
of
jerusalem
nor
that
one
or
two
old
mounds
have
been
partly
explored
but
what
is
this
to
the
great
work
that
needs
to
be
done
there
has
been
found
on
the
surface
the
moabite
stone
at
the
old
capital
of
dibon
a
wonderful
record
of
early
kings
mentioned
in
the
bible
and
there
is
the
short
account
in
the
conduit
of
siloam
of
the
success
of
the
workmen
in
the
time
of
hezekiah
who
beginning
at
the
two
ends
did
the
fine
engineering
feat
of
having
their
tunnels
meet
correctly
in
the
solid
rock
but
when
jerusalem
is
fully
explored
and
the
northern
capitals
of
bethel
and
tirzah
and
samaria
and
a
hundred
other
mounds
that
mark
the
site
of
jewish
israelite
philistine
and
amorite
cities
we
may
expect
marvellous
discoveries
that
will
illumine
our
holy
scriptures
and
one
region
yet
remains
to
be
considered
the
scattered
coasts
and
islands
that
owned
the
greek
speech
and
that
created
the
greek
civilization
it
is
not
the
greece
of
the
parthenon
and
pericles
that
we
wish
to
discover
for
that
we
fairly
know
but
the
arts
and
the
history
of
those
earlier
greeks
and
trojans
that
homer
tells
of
the
age
of
agamemnon
and
ulysses
of
helen
and
hector
and
priam
and
of
the
yet
earlier
tribes
that
sailed
the
aegean
and
settled
the
mediterranean
islands
and
sent
their
ships
to
the
egyptian
coasts
and
sought
golden
fleeces
on
the
euxine
sea
all
about
the
coast
of
asia
minor
they
lived
while
that
hittite
power
was
ruling
the
interior
and
intermixed
with
phoenician
they
held
the
great
islands
of
crete
and
cyprus
and
the
shores
of
sicily
and
italy
what
shall
we
call
them
were
they
dorians
or
heraclidae
achaeans
or
pelasgi
were
they
of
the
same
race
as
the
mysterious
etruscans
or
shall
we
name
them
simply
mycenaeans
as
we
call
the
art
mycenaean
that
ruled
the
islands
and
coasts
down
to
the
homeric
age
and
we
know
not
how
many
centuries
earlier
but
certainly
as
far
back
as
the
conquering
period
of
the
eighteenth
egyptian
dynasty
of
thothmes
their
soldiers
and
merchants
and
their
fine
vases
are
pictured
on
the
walls
of
egypt
and
their
pottery
has
long
been
studied
but
we
knew
little
of
them
until
schliemann
the
greek
merchant
who
achieved
wealth
in
the
united
states
bravely
opened
the
great
ruins
of
troy
in
the
full
patriotism
of
his
assurance
that
homer
story
of
the
trojan
war
was
history
as
well
as
poetry
as
he
found
one
burnt
and
buried
city
under
another
for
many
times
was
troy
destroyed
and
extended
his
investigations
to
tiryns
and
other
ancient
cities
one
volume
of
splendid
research
followed
another
until
the
trader
had
compelled
the
unwilling
scholar
to
confess
that
he
must
dig
for
both
history
and
art
to
be
sure
his
interpretations
were
quite
too
literal
at
first
but
the
whole
world
of
classical
scholarship
has
learned
from
him
the
new
method
of
research
splendid
have
been
the
results
if
we
are
not
sure
which
stratum
represents
the
city
of
priam
we
do
learn
how
the
people
lived
and
how
fine
was
their
work
in
silver
and
gold
and
how
slight
their
knowledge
of
letters
schliemann
has
now
a
multitude
of
imitators
france
and
germany
and
england
and
the
united
states
each
maintain
a
school
of
archaeology
in
athens
and
each
conducts
careful
explorations
our
american
school
lost
to
the
french
for
lack
of
money
at
the
right
time
the
chance
to
explore
delphi
but
it
has
carried
on
careful
explorations
at
corinth
and
other
places
how
wonderful
was
the
discovery
not
long
ago
of
a
shipload
of
bronze
and
marble
statues
wrecked
while
being
transported
as
spoil
of
war
from
corinth
to
rome
but
the
most
surprising
discoveries
in
the
realm
of
old
greek
history
and
art
are
those
that
have
been
made
in
these
last
two
or
three
years
in
crete
crete
was
a
famous
centre
of
ancient
greek
legend
jupiter
was
born
and
reared
on
mount
ida
from
another
mountain
summit
in
crete
the
gods
watched
the
battle
on
the
plains
of
troy
there
ruled
minos
who
first
gave
laws
to
men
and
who
at
his
death
was
sent
by
the
gods
to
judge
the
shades
as
they
entered
the
lower
world
there
was
the
famous
labyrinth
and
there
the
minotaur
devoured
his
annual
tale
of
maidens
until
he
was
slain
by
theseus
was
there
such

nothing
better

cruel

we
can
give

seemed
to

the

mighty
empires
of
the

which
have
kindly
covered
and
preserved
them
just
as
we

uninjured
the
choicest

the
most
precious

no

is

whose
work
is
not
born
with
him
there
is
always
work
and
tools
to
work
withal
for
those
who
will
lowell
a
man
was
born
into
the
world
on
the
of
september
whose
work
was
born
with
him
and
who
did
this
work
so
well
that
he
became
one
of
its
greatest
benefactors
indeed
much
of
the
marvellous
advance
made
in
the
electric
arts
and
sciences
during
the
last
can
be
directly
traced
to
this
work
it
was
in
newington
butts
in
london
england
that
the
first
opened
his
eyes
on
the
wonders
of
the
physical
world
around
him
to
those
eyes
in
after
years
were
given
a
far
deeper
insight
into
the
mysteries
of
nature
than
often
falls
to
the
lot
of
man
this
was
michael
faraday
who
has
been
justly
styled
by
those
best
capable
of
judging
him
the
prince
of
experimental
philosophers
the
precocity
so
common
in
the
childhood
of
men
of
genius
was
apparently
absent
in
the
case
of
young
faraday
the
growing
boy
played
marbles
and
worried
through
a
scant
education
in
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
unnoticed
and
most
probably
for
the
greater
part
severely
left
alone
as
commonly
falls
to
the
lot
of
nearly
all
boys
whether
ordinary
or
extraordinary
at
the
early
age
of
thirteen
he
was
taken
from
school
and
placed
on
trial
as
in
the
of
george
ribeau
in
london
after
a
year
at
this
work
he
was
taken
as
an
apprentice
to
the
trade
by
the
same
employer
who
on
account
of
his
faithful
services
remitted
the
customary
premium
at
this
work
he
spent
some
eight
years
of
his
life
but
far
be
it
from
us
even
to
hint
at
the
absence
of
genius
in
the
young
child
genius
is
not
an
acquired
gift
it
is
born
in
the
individual
apart
from
the
marvellous
achievements
of
the
man
a
mere
glance
at
the
magnificent
head
with
its
high
intellectual
forehead
the
firm
lips
the
intelligent
inquiring
eyes
and
the
bright
face
as
seen
in
existing
pictures
assures
us
that
they
portray
an
unusual
individuality
incompatible
with
even
a
suspicion
of
belonging
to
an
ordinary
man
doubtless
the
growing
child
did
give
early
promise
of
his
future
greatness
doubtless
he
was
a
formidable
member
of
that
terrible
class
of
inquiring
youngsters
who
demand
the
why
and
the
wherefore
of
all
around
them
and
refuse
to
accept
the
unsatisfactory
belief
of
their
fathers
that
things
are
because
they
are
in
its
the
busy
world
is
too
apt
to
fail
to
notice
unusual
abilities
in
children
abilities
that
perhaps
too
often
remain
undeveloped
from
lack
of
opportunities
but
whether
young
faraday
did
or
did
not
at
an
early
age
display
any
unusual
promise
of
his
all
his
biographers
appear
to
agree
that
he
could
not
be
regarded
as
a
precocious
child
faraday
disclaimed
the
idea
that
his
childhood
was
distinguished
by
any
precocity
do
not
suppose
that
i
was
a
very
deep
thinker
or
was
marked
as
a
precocious
person
says
faraday
when
alluding
to
his
early
life
i
was
a
very
lively
imaginative
person
and
could
believe
in
the
nights
as
easily
as
the
but
facts
were
important
to
me
and
saved
me
i
could
trust
a
fact
and
always
an
assertion
so
when
i
questioned
marcet
book
he
is
alluding
to
her
on
chemistry
by
such
little
experiments
as
i
could
find
means
to
perform
and
found
it
true
to
the
facts
as
i
could
understand
them
i
felt
that
i
had
got
hold
of
an
anchor
in
chemical
knowledge
and
clung
fast
to
it
but
while
there
may
be
a
question
as
to
the
existence
of
precocity
in
the
young
lad
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
reason
for
believing
that
his
unusual
abilities
were
the
result
of
direct
heredity
his
father
an
ordinary
journeyman
blacksmith
never
exhibited
any
special
intellectual
ability
though
possibly
poverty
and
poor
health
may
have
been
responsible
for
this
failure
his
mother
too
it
appears
was
of
but
ordinary
mentality
the
environment
of
those
early
years
that
is
from
to
while
in
the
business
was
far
from
calculated
to
develop
any
marked
abilities
inherent
in
our
young
philosopher
what
would
seem
less
calculated
to
inspire
a
wish
to
obtain
a
deeper
insight
into
the
mysteries
of
the
physical
world
than
the
trade
of
especially
in
the
case
of
a
boy
whose
scholastic
education
ceased
at
fourteen
years
and
was
limited
to
the
mere
rudiments
of
learning
but
fortunately
for
the
world
the
inquiring
spirit
of
the
lad
led
him
to
examine
the
inside
of
the
books
he
bound
and
thus
by
familiarizing
himself
with
their
contents
he
received
the
inspiration
that
good
writing
is
always
ready
to
bestow
on
those
who
properly
read
it
two
books
he
afterwards
informs
us
proved
of
especial
benefit
namely
marcet
conversations
on
chemistry
already
referred
to
and
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
to
the
former
he
attributes
his
grounding
in
chemistry
and
to
the
latter
his
first
ideas
in
electricity
in
both
of
which
studies
he
excelled
in
after
years
as
we
have
seen
even
at
this
early
age
he
followed
the
true
plan
for
the
physical
investigator
all
statements
only
admitting
those
to
the
dignity
of
facts
whose
truth
he
had
established
by
careful
experimentation
but
our
future
experimental
philosopher
has
not
as
yet
fairly
started
on
the
beginnings
of
his
the
possibilities
of
the
trade
were
too
limited
to
permit
much
real
progress
a
circumstance
occurred
in
the
spring
of
that
shaped
his
entire
this
was
the
opportunity
then
afforded
him
to
attend
four
of
the
last
lectures
delivered
at
the
royal
institution
by
the
great
sir
humphry
davy
faraday
took
copious
notes
of
these
lectures
carefully
wrote
them
out
and
bound
them
in
a
small
quarto
volume
it
was
this
volume
which
he
afterwards
sent
to
davy
that
resulted
in
his
receiving
on
march
the
appointment
of
laboratory
assistant
in
the
royal
institution
his
pay
for
this
work
was
shillings
a
week
with
a
lodging
on
the
top
floor
of
the
institute
a
very
fair
compensation
for
the
times
very
congenial
were
the
duties
of
the
young
assistant
they
were
to
keep
clean
the
beloved
apparatus
of
the
lecturers
and
to
assist
them
in
their
demonstrations
the
new
world
thus
opened
was
full
of
bright
promise
he
keenly
felt
the
deficiencies
of
his
early
education
and
did
his
best
to
extend
his
learning
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
make
the
most
of
his
opportunities
but
what
he
perhaps
appreciated
the
most
was
the
inspiration
he
received
from
the
great
teacher
davy
who
was
then
professor
of
chemistry
and
director
of
the
laboratory
of
the
royal
institution
for
faraday
assisted
at
davy
lectures
and
in
an
humble
way
even
aided
his
investigations
sharing
the
dangers
arising
from
the
explosion
of
the
unstable
substance
chloride
of
nitrogen
that
davy
was
then
investigating
faraday
has
repeatedly
acknowledged
the
debt
owed
to
the
inspiration
of
this
teacher
davy
also
in
later
life
generously
recognized
in
his
former
assistant
a
philosopher
greater
than
himself
as
the
renowned
astronomer
tycho
brahe
discovered
in
one
of
his
pupils
john
kepler
an
astronomer
greater
than
the
master
and
as
bergman
the
swedish
chemist
in
a
similar
manner
discovered
the
greater
chemist
scheele
so
when
davy
in
after
years
was
asked
what
he
regarded
as
his
greatest
discovery
he
briefly
replied
michael
faraday
the
task
of
the
scientific
historian
who
endeavors
honestly
to
record
the
progress
of
research
and
to
trace
the
influence
of
the
work
of
some
individual
on
the
times
in
which
he
lived
is
by
no
means
an
easy
one
for
in
scientific
work
one
discovery
frequently
passes
so
insensibly
into
another
that
it
is
often
difficult
to
know
just
where
one
stops
and
the
other
begins
and
much
difficulty
constantly
arises
as
to
whom
the
credit
should
be
given
when
as
is
too
often
the
case
these
discoveries
are
made
by
different
individuals
it
is
only
when
some
great
discovery
stands
alone
like
a
giant
mountain
peak
against
the
clear
sky
that
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
determine
the
extent
and
character
of
its
influence
on
other
discoveries
and
justly
to
give
the
credit
to
whom
the
credit
is
due
such
discoveries
form
ready
points
of
reference
in
the
intellectual
horizon
and
mark
distinct
eras
in
the
world
progress
this
is
true
of
all
work
in
the
domain
of
physical
science
but
it
is
especially
true
in
that
of
electricity
and
magnetism
in
which
faraday
was
the
scope
of
each
of
these
sciences
is
so
extended
the
number
of
workers
so
great
and
the
applications
to
the
practical
arts
so
nearly
innumerable
that
it
is
often
by
no
means
an
easy
task
correctly
to
trace
their
proper
growth
and
development
faraday
investigations
covered
vast
fields
in
the
domain
of
chemistry
electricity
and
magnetism
it
is
to
the
last
two
only
that
reference
will
here
be
made
faraday
in
electricity
and
magnetism
began
practically
in
when
he
made
his
immortal
discovery
of
the
direct
production
of
electricity
from
magnetism
his
best
work
in
electricity
and
magnetism
was
accomplished
between
and
extending
therefore
over
a
period
of
some
years
although
it
is
not
denied
that
good
work
was
done
since
consequently
it
was
at
so
comparatively
recent
a
date
that
most
of
faraday
work
was
done
that
some
of
the
world
distinguished
electricians
yet
live
who
began
their
studies
during
the
latter
years
of
faraday
life
the
difficulties
of
tracing
at
least
to
some
extent
the
influence
that
faraday
masterly
investigations
have
had
on
the
present
condition
of
the
electrical
arts
and
sciences
will
therefore
be
considerably
lessened
the
extent
of
faraday
researches
and
discoveries
in
magnetism
and
electricity
was
so
great
that
it
will
be
impossible
in
the
necessarily
limited
space
of
a
brief
biographical
sketch
to
notice
any
but
the
more
prominent
nor
will
any
attempt
be
made
except
where
the
nature
of
the
research
or
discovery
appears
to
render
it
advisable
to
follow
any
strict
chronological
order
for
our
inquiry
here
is
not
so
much
directed
to
a
mere
matter
of
history
as
to
the
influence
which
the
investigation
or
discovery
exerted
on
the
life
and
civilization
of
the
age
in
which
we
live
there
is
a
single
discovery
of
faraday
that
stands
out
sharply
amidst
all
his
other
discoveries
great
as
they
were
and
is
so
important
in
its
results
that
it
alone
would
have
stamped
him
as
a
philosophical
investigator
of
the
highest
merits
had
he
never
done
anything
else
this
was
his
discovery
of
the
means
for
developing
electricity
directly
from
magnetism
it
was
made
on
the
of
august
and
should
be
regarded
as
inspired
by
the
great
discovery
made
by
oersted
in
of
the
relations
existing
between
the
voltaic
pile
and
it
was
in
the
same
year
that
ampere
had
conducted
that
memorable
investigation
as
to
the
mutual
attractions
and
repulsions
between
circuits
through
which
electric
currents
are
flowing
which
resulted
in
a
theory
of
and
finally
led
to
the
production
of
the
itself
ampere
had
shown
that
a
coil
of
wire
or
helix
through
which
an
electric
current
is
passing
acted
practically
as
a
magnet
and
arago
had
magnetized
an
iron
bar
by
placing
it
within
such
a
helix
in
common
with
the
other
scientific
men
of
his
time
faraday
believed
that
since
the
flow
of
an
electric
current
invariably
produced
magnetism
so
magnetism
should
in
its
turn
be
capable
of
producing
electricity
many
investigators
before
faraday
time
had
endeavored
to
solve
this
problem
but
it
was
reserved
to
faraday
alone
to
be
successful
since
success
in
this
investigation
resulted
from
some
experiments
he
made
while
endeavoring
to
obtain
inductive
action
on
a
quiescent
circuit
from
a
neighboring
circuit
through
which
an
electric
current
was
flowing
we
will
first
briefly
examine
this
experiment
all
his
experiments
in
this
direction
were
at
first
unsuccessful
he
passed
an
electric
current
through
a
circuit
which
was
located
close
to
another
circuit
containing
a
galvanometer
a
device
for
showing
the
presence
of
an
electric
current
and
measuring
its
strength
but
failed
to
obtain
any
result
he
looked
for
such
results
only
when
the
current
had
been
fully
established
in
the
active
circuit
undismayed
by
failure
he
reasoned
that
probably
effects
were
present
but
that
they
were
too
small
to
be
observed
owing
to
the
feeble
inducing
current
employed
he
therefore
increased
the
strength
of
the
current
in
the
active
wire
but
still
with
no
results
again
and
again
he
interrogates
nature
but
unsuccessfully
at
last
he
notices
that
there
is
a
slight
movement
of
the
galvanometer
needle
at
the
moment
of
making
and
breaking
the
circuit
carefully
repeating
his
experiments
in
the
light
of
this
observation
he
discovers
the
important
fact
that
it
is
only
at
the
moment
a
current
is
increasing
or
decreasing
in
strength
at
the
moment
of
making
or
breaking
a
circuit
that
the
active
circuit
is
capable
of
producing
a
current
in
a
neighboring
inactive
circuit
by
induction
this
was
an
important
discovery
and
in
the
light
of
his
was
correctly
regarded
as
a
solution
of
the
production
of
electricity
from
magnetism
observing
that
the
galvanometer
needle
momentarily
swings
in
one
direction
on
making
the
circuit
and
in
the
opposite
direction
on
breaking
it
he
establishes
the
fact
that
the
current
induced
on
making
flows
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
inducing
current
and
that
induced
on
breaking
flows
in
the
same
direction
as
the
inducing
current
having
thus
established
the
fact
of
current
induction
he
makes
the
step
of
substituting
magnets
for
active
circuits
a
simple
step
in
the
light
of
our
present
knowledge
but
a
giant
stride
at
that
time
remembering
that
current
induction
or
as
he
called
it
voltaic
current
induction
takes
place
only
while
some
effect
produced
by
the
current
is
either
increasing
or
decreasing
he
moves
coils
of
insulated
wire
towards
or
from
magnet
poles
or
magnet
poles
towards
or
from
coils
of
wire
and
shows
that
electric
currents
are
generated
in
the
coils
while
either
the
coils
or
the
magnets
are
in
motion
but
cease
to
be
produced
as
soon
as
the
motion
ceases
moreover
these
magnetically
induced
currents
differ
in
no
respects
from
other
currents
for
example
those
produced
by
the
voltaic
pile
since
like
the
latter
they
produce
sparks
magnetize
bars
of
steel
or
deflect
the
needle
of
a
galvanometer
in
this
manner
faraday
solved
the
great
problem
he
had
produced
electricity
directly
from
magnetism
with
perhaps
the
single
exception
of
the
discovery
by
oersted
in
of
the
invariable
relation
existing
between
an
electric
current
and
magnetism
this
discovery
of
faraday
may
be
justly
regarded
as
the
greatest
in
this
domain
of
physical
science
these
two
master
minds
in
scientific
research
wonderfully
complemented
each
other
oersted
showed
that
an
electric
current
is
invariably
attended
by
magnetic
effects
faraday
showed
that
magnetic
changes
are
invariably
attended
by
electric
currents
before
these
discoveries
electricity
and
magnetism
were
necessarily
regarded
as
separate
branches
of
physical
science
and
were
studied
apart
as
separate
phenomena
now
however
they
must
be
regarded
as
phenomena
the
ignorance
of
the
scientific
world
had
unwittingly
divorced
what
nature
had
joined
together
in
view
of
the
great
importance
of
faraday
discovery
we
shall
be
justified
in
inquiring
though
somewhat
briefly
into
some
of
the
apparatus
employed
in
this
historic
research
note
its
extreme
simplicity
in
one
of
his
first
successful
experiments
he
wraps
a
coil
of
insulated
wire
around
the
soft
iron
bar
that
forms
the
armature
or
keeper
of
a
permanent
magnet
of
the
type
and
connects
the
ends
of
this
coil
to
a
galvanometer
he
discovers
that
whenever
the
armature
is
placed
against
the
magnet
poles
and
is
therefore
being
rendered
magnetic
by
contact
therewith
the
deflection
of
the
needle
of
the
galvanometer
shows
that
the
coiled
wire
on
the
armature
is
traversed
by
a
current
of
electricity
that
whenever
the
armature
is
removed
from
the
magnet
poles
and
is
therefore
losing
its
magnetism
the
needle
of
the
galvanometer
is
again
deflected
but
now
in
the
opposite
direction
showing
that
an
electric
current
is
again
flowing
through
the
coiled
wire
on
the
armature
but
reversed
in
direction
he
notices
too
that
these
effects
take
place
only
while
changes
are
going
on
in
the
strength
of
the
magnetism
in
the
armature
or
when
magnetic
flux
is
passing
through
the
coils
for
the
galvanometer
needle
comes
to
rest
and
remains
at
rest
as
long
as
the
contact
between
the
armature
and
the
poles
remains
unbroken
in
another
experiment
he
employs
a
simple
hollow
coil
or
helix
of
insulated
wire
whose
ends
are
connected
with
a
galvanometer
on
suddenly
thrusting
one
end
of
a
straight
cylindrical
magnet
into
the
axis
of
the
helix
the
deflection
of
the
galvanometer
needle
showed
the
presence
of
an
electric
current
in
the
helix
the
magnet
being
left
in
the
helix
the
galvanometer
needle
came
to
rest
thus
showing
the
absence
of
current
when
the
bar
magnet
was
suddenly
withdrawn
from
the
helix
the
galvanometer
needle
was
again
deflected
but
now
in
the
opposite
direction
showing
that
the
direction
of
the
current
in
the
helix
had
been
reversed
the
preceding
are
but
some
of
the
results
that
faraday
obtained
by
means
of
his
experimental
researches
in
the
direct
production
of
electricity
from
magnetism
let
us
now
briefly
examine
just
what
he
was
doing
and
the
means
whereby
he
obtained
electric
currents
from
magnetism
we
will
consider
this
question
from
the
views
of
the
present
time
rather
than
from
those
of
faraday
although
the
difference
between
the
two
are
in
most
respects
immaterial
faraday
knew
that
the
space
or
region
around
a
magnet
is
permeated
or
traversed
by
what
he
called
magnetic
curves
or
lines
of
magnetic
force
these
lines
are
still
called
lines
of
magnetic
force
or
by
some
magnetic
streamings
magnetic
flux
or
simply
magnetism
they
are
invisible
though
their
presence
is
readily
manifested
by
means
of
iron
filings
they
are
present
in
every
magnet
and
although
we
do
not
know
in
what
direction
they
move
yet
in
order
to
speak
definitely
about
them
it
is
agreed
to
assume
that
they
pass
out
of
every
magnet
at
its
pole
or
the
pole
which
would
point
to
the
magnetic
north
were
the
magnet
free
to
move
as
a
needle
and
after
having
traversed
the
space
surrounding
the
magnet
reenter
at
its
pole
thus
completing
what
is
called
the
magnetic
circuit
any
space
traversed
by
lines
of
magnetic
force
is
called
a
magnetic
field
but
it
is
not
only
a
magnet
that
is
thus
surrounded
by
lines
of
magnetic
force
or
by
ether
streamings
the
same
is
true
of
any
conductor
through
which
an
electric
current
is
flowing
and
their
presence
may
be
shown
by
means
of
iron
filings
if
an
active
conductor
a
conductor
conveying
an
electric
current
as
for
example
a
copper
wire
be
passed
vertically
through
a
piece
of
or
a
glass
plate
iron
filings
dusted
on
the
card
or
plate
will
arrange
themselves
in
concentric
circles
around
the
axis
of
the
wire
it
requires
an
expenditure
of
energy
both
to
set
up
and
to
maintain
these
lines
of
force
it
is
the
interaction
of
their
lines
of
force
that
causes
the
attractions
and
repulsions
in
active
movable
conductors
these
lines
of
magnetic
force
act
on
magnetic
needles
like
other
lines
of
magnetic
force
and
tend
to
set
movable
magnetic
needles
at
right
angles
to
the
conducting
wire
the
setting
up
of
an
electric
current
in
a
conducting
wire
is
therefore
equivalent
to
the
setting
up
of
concentric
magnetic
whirls
around
the
axis
of
the
wire
and
anything
that
can
do
this
will
produce
an
electric
current
for
example
if
an
inactive
conducting
wire
is
moved
through
a
magnetic
field
it
will
have
concentric
circular
whirls
set
up
around
it
or
in
other
words
it
will
have
a
current
generated
in
it
as
a
result
of
such
motion
but
to
set
up
these
whirls
it
is
not
enough
that
the
conducting
wire
be
moved
along
the
lines
of
force
in
the
field
in
such
a
case
no
whirls
are
produced
around
the
conductor
the
conductor
must
be
moved
so
as
to
cut
or
pass
through
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
just
what
the
mechanism
is
by
means
of
which
the
cutting
of
the
lines
of
force
by
the
conductor
produces
the
circular
magnetic
whirls
around
it
no
man
knows
any
more
than
he
knows
just
what
electricity
is
but
this
much
we
do
know
that
to
produce
the
circular
whirls
or
currents
in
a
previously
inactive
conductor
the
lines
of
force
of
some
already
existing
magnetic
field
must
be
caused
to
pass
through
the
conductor
and
that
the
strength
of
the
current
so
produced
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
lines
of
magnetic
force
cut
in
a
given
time
say
per
second
or
in
other
words
is
directly
proportional
to
the
strength
of
the
magnetic
field
and
to
the
velocity
and
length
of
the
moving
conductor
or
briefly
recapitulating
oersted
showed
that
an
electric
current
passed
through
a
conducting
circuit
sets
up
concentric
circular
whirls
around
its
axis
that
is
an
electric
current
invariably
produces
magnetism
faraday
showed
that
if
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
or
magnetism
be
caused
to
cut
or
pass
through
an
inactive
conductor
concentric
circular
whirls
will
be
set
up
around
the
conductor
that
is
lines
of
magnetic
force
passed
across
a
conductor
invariably
set
up
an
electric
current
in
that
conductor
the
wonderful
completeness
of
faraday
researches
into
the
production
of
electricity
from
magnetism
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
all
the
forms
of
induction
known
namely
or
the
induction
of
an
active
circuit
on
itself
mutual
induction
or
the
induction
of
an
active
circuit
on
a
neighboring
circuit
and
induction
and
induction
or
the
induction
produced
in
conductors
through
which
the
magnetic
flux
from
electro
and
permanent
magnets
respectively
is
caused
to
pass
were
discovered
and
investigated
by
him
nor
were
these
investigations
carried
on
in
the
haphazard
blundering
groping
manner
that
unfortunately
too
often
characterizes
the
explorer
in
a
strange
country
on
the
contrary
they
were
singularly
clear
and
direct
showing
how
complete
the
mastery
the
great
investigator
had
over
the
subject
he
was
studying
it
is
true
that
repeated
failures
frequently
met
him
but
despite
discouragements
and
disappointments
he
continued
until
he
had
entirely
traversed
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
unknown
region
he
was
the
first
to
explore
let
us
now
briefly
examine
faraday
many
remaining
discoveries
and
inventions
though
none
of
these
were
equal
to
his
great
discovery
yet
many
were
exceedingly
valuable
some
were
almost
immediately
utilized
some
waited
many
years
for
utilization
and
some
have
never
yet
been
utilized
we
must
avoid
however
falling
into
the
common
mistake
of
holding
in
little
esteem
those
parts
of
faraday
work
that
did
not
immediately
result
either
in
the
production
of
practical
apparatus
or
in
valuable
applications
in
the
arts
and
sciences
or
those
which
have
not
even
yet
proved
fruitful
some
discoveries
and
devices
are
so
far
ahead
of
the
times
in
which
they
are
produced
that
several
lifetimes
often
pass
before
the
world
is
ready
to
utilize
them
like
immature
or
unripe
fruit
they
are
apt
to
die
an
untimely
death
and
it
sometimes
curiously
happens
that
several
generations
after
their
birth
a
subsequent
inventor
or
discoverer
in
honest
ignorance
of
their
prior
existence
offers
them
to
the
world
as
absolutely
new
the
times
being
ripe
they
pass
into
immediate
and
extended
public
use
so
that
the
later
inventor
is
given
all
the
credit
of
an
original
discovery
and
the
true
first
and
original
inventor
remains
unrecognized
we
will
first
examine
faraday
discovery
of
the
relations
existing
between
light
and
magnetism
though
the
discovery
has
not
as
yet
borne
fruit
in
any
direct
practical
application
yet
it
has
proved
of
immense
value
from
a
theoretical
standpoint
in
this
investigation
faraday
proved
that
are
rotated
by
the
action
of
a
magnetic
field
he
employed
the
light
of
an
ordinary
argand
lamp
and
polarized
it
by
reflection
from
a
glass
surface
he
caused
this
polarized
light
to
pass
through
a
plate
of
heavy
glass
made
from
a
of
lead
under
ordinary
circumstances
this
substance
exerted
no
unusual
action
on
light
but
when
it
was
placed
between
the
poles
of
a
powerful
and
the
light
was
passed
through
it
in
the
same
direction
as
the
magnetic
flux
the
plane
of
polarization
of
the
light
was
rotated
in
a
certain
direction
faraday
discovered
that
other
solid
substances
besides
glass
exert
a
similar
action
on
a
beam
of
polarized
light
even
opaque
solids
like
iron
possess
this
property
kerr
has
proved
that
a
beam
of
light
passed
through
an
extremely
thin
plate
of
highly
magnetic
iron
has
its
plane
of
polarization
slightly
rotated
faraday
showed
that
the
power
of
rotating
a
beam
of
polarized
light
is
also
possessed
by
some
liquids
but
what
is
most
interesting
in
both
solids
and
liquids
is
that
the
direction
of
the
rotation
of
the
light
depends
on
the
direction
in
which
the
magnetism
is
passing
and
can
therefore
be
changed
by
changing
the
polarity
of
the
faraday
did
not
seem
to
thoroughly
understand
this
phenomenon
he
spoke
as
if
he
thought
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
had
been
rendered
luminous
by
the
light
rays
for
he
announced
his
discovery
in
a
paper
entitled
magnetization
of
light
and
the
illumination
of
the
lines
of
magnetic
force
indeed
this
discovery
was
so
far
ahead
of
the
times
that
it
was
not
until
a
later
date
that
the
results
were
more
fully
developed
first
by
kelvin
and
subsequently
by
clerk
maxwell
in
two
years
before
faraday
death
maxwell
proposed
the
theory
of
light
showing
that
light
is
an
disturbance
he
pointed
out
that
optical
as
well
as
phenomena
required
a
medium
for
their
propagation
and
that
the
properties
of
this
medium
appeared
to
be
the
same
for
both
moreover
the
rate
at
which
light
travels
is
known
by
actual
measurement
the
rate
at
which
waves
are
propagated
can
be
calculated
from
electrical
measurements
and
these
two
velocities
exactly
agree
faraday
original
experiment
as
to
the
relation
between
light
and
magnetism
is
thus
again
experimentally
demonstrated
and
maxwell
theory
of
light
now
resting
on
experimental
fact
optics
becomes
a
branch
of
electricity
a
curious
consequence
was
pointed
out
by
maxwell
as
a
result
of
his
theory
namely
that
a
necessary
relation
exists
between
opacity
and
conductivity
since
as
he
showed
disturbances
could
not
be
propagated
in
substances
which
are
conductors
of
electricity
in
other
words
if
light
is
an
disturbance
all
conducting
substances
must
be
opaque
and
all
good
insulators
transparent
this
we
know
to
be
the
fact
metallic
substances
the
best
of
conductors
are
opaque
while
glass
and
crystals
are
transparent
even
such
apparent
exceptions
as
vulcanite
an
excellent
insulator
fall
into
the
law
since
as
graham
bell
has
recently
shown
this
substance
is
remarkably
transparent
to
certain
kinds
of
radiant
energy
in
brugmans
of
leyden
noticed
that
if
a
piece
of
bismuth
was
held
near
either
pole
of
a
strong
magnet
repulsion
occurred
other
observers
noticed
the
same
effect
in
the
case
of
antimony
these
facts
appear
to
have
been
unknown
to
faraday
who
in
by
employing
powerful
rediscovered
them
and
in
addition
showed
that
practically
all
substances
possess
the
power
of
being
attracted
or
repelled
when
placed
between
the
poles
of
sufficiently
powerful
magnets
by
placing
slender
needles
of
the
substances
experimented
on
between
the
poles
of
powerful
magnets
he
found
that
they
were
all
either
attracted
like
iron
coming
to
rest
with
their
greatest
length
extending
between
the
poles
or
like
bismuth
were
apparently
repelled
by
the
poles
coming
to
rest
at
right
angles
to
the
position
assumed
by
iron
he
regarded
the
first
class
of
substances
as
attracted
and
the
second
class
as
repelled
and
called
them
respectively
paramagnetic
and
diamagnetic
substances
in
other
words
paramagnetic
substances
like
iron
came
to
rest
axially
extending
from
pole
to
pole
and
diamagnetic
substances
like
bismuth
equatorially
extending
transversely
between
the
poles
he
reserved
the
term
magnetic
substances
to
cover
the
phenomena
of
both
para
and
he
communicated
the
results
of
this
investigation
to
the
royal
society
in
a
paper
on
the
magnetic
condition
of
all
matter
on
the
properties
of
paramagnetism
and
diamagnetism
are
not
possessed
by
solids
only
but
exist
also
in
liquids
and
gases
when
experimenting
with
liquids
they
were
placed
in
suitable
glass
vessels
such
as
watch
crystals
supported
on
pole
pieces
properly
shaped
to
receive
them
under
these
circumstances
paramagnetic
liquids
such
as
salts
of
iron
or
cobalt
dissolved
in
water
underwent
curious
contortions
in
shape
the
tendency
being
to
arrange
the
greater
part
of
their
mass
in
the
direction
in
which
the
flux
passed
namely
directly
between
the
poles
diamagnetic
liquids
such
as
solutions
of
salts
of
bismuth
and
antimony
in
a
similar
manner
arranged
the
greater
part
of
their
mass
in
positions
at
right
angles
to
this
direction
or
equatorially
at
first
faraday
attributed
the
repulsion
of
diamagnetic
substances
to
a
polarity
separate
and
distinct
from
ordinary
magnetic
polarity
for
which
he
proposed
the
name
diamagnetic
polarity
he
believed
that
when
a
diamagnetic
substance
is
brought
near
to
the
north
pole
of
a
magnet
a
north
pole
was
developed
in
its
approached
end
and
that
therefore
repulsion
occurred
he
afterwards
rejected
this
view
though
it
has
been
subsequently
adopted
by
weber
and
tyndall
the
latter
of
whom
conducted
an
extended
series
of
experiments
on
the
subject
the
majority
of
physicists
however
at
the
present
time
do
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
diamagnetic
polarity
they
point
out
that
the
apparent
repulsion
of
diamagnetic
substances
is
due
to
the
fact
that
they
are
less
paramagnetic
than
the
oxygen
of
the
air
in
which
they
are
suspended
during
this
investigation
faraday
observed
some
phenomena
that
led
him
to
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
another
form
of
force
distinct
from
either
paramagnetic
or
diamagnetic
force
which
he
called
the
force
he
had
been
experimenting
with
some
slender
needles
of
bismuth
suspending
them
horizontally
between
the
poles
of
an
taking
a
few
of
these
cylinders
at
random
from
a
greater
number
he
was
much
perplexed
to
find
that
they
did
not
all
come
to
rest
equatorially
as
bars
of
diamagnetic
bismuth
should
do
though
if
subjected
to
the
action
of
a
single
magnetic
pole
they
did
show
this
diamagnetic
character
by
their
marked
repulsion
after
much
experimentation
he
ascribed
this
phenomenon
to
the
crystalline
condition
of
the
cylinder
by
experimenting
with
carefully
selected
groups
of
crystals
of
bismuth
he
believed
he
could
trace
the
cause
of
the
phenomenon
to
the
action
of
a
force
which
he
called
the
force
extended
experiments
carried
on
by
plücker
on
the
influence
of
magnetism
on
crystalline
substances
led
him
to
believe
that
a
close
relation
exists
between
the
ultimate
forms
of
the
particles
of
matter
and
their
magnetic
behavior
this
subject
is
as
yet
far
from
being
fully
understood
there
was
another
series
of
investigations
made
by
faraday
between
the
years
and
that
has
been
wonderfully
utilized
and
may
properly
be
ranked
among
his
great
discoveries
we
allude
to
his
researches
on
the
laws
which
govern
the
chemical
decomposition
of
compound
substances
by
electricity
the
fact
that
the
electric
current
possesses
the
power
of
decomposing
compound
substances
was
known
as
early
as
when
carlisle
and
nicholson
separated
water
into
its
constituent
elements
by
the
passage
of
a
voltaic
current
davy
too
in
had
delivered
his
celebrated
discourse
on
some
chemical
agencies
of
electricity
and
in
had
announced
his
great
discovery
of
the
decomposition
of
the
fixed
alkalies
faraday
showed
that
the
amount
of
chemical
action
produced
by
electricity
is
fixed
and
definite
in
order
to
be
able
to
measure
the
amount
of
this
action
he
invented
an
instrument
which
he
called
a
voltameter
or
a
it
consisted
of
a
simple
device
for
measuring
the
amount
of
hydrogen
and
oxygen
gases
liberated
by
the
passage
of
an
electric
current
through
water
acidulated
with
sulphuric
acid
he
showed
by
numerous
experiments
that
the
decomposition
effected
is
invariably
proportional
to
the
amount
of
electricity
passing
that
variations
in
the
size
of
the
electrodes
in
the
pressure
or
in
the
degree
of
dilution
of
the
electrolyte
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
result
and
that
therefore
a
voltameter
could
be
employed
to
determine
the
amount
of
electricity
passing
in
a
given
circuit
he
also
demonstrated
that
when
a
current
is
passed
through
different
electrolytes
compound
substances
decomposed
by
the
passage
of
electricity
the
amount
of
the
decompositions
are
chemically
equivalent
to
each
other
the
extent
of
faraday
work
in
the
field
may
be
judged
by
considering
some
of
the
terms
he
proposed
for
its
phenomena
most
of
which
with
some
trifling
exceptions
are
still
in
use
it
was
he
who
gave
the
name
electrolysis
to
decomposition
by
the
electric
current
he
also
proposed
to
call
the
wires
or
conductors
connected
with
the
battery
or
other
electric
source
the
electrodes
naming
that
one
which
was
connected
with
the
positive
terminal
the
anode
and
that
one
connected
with
the
negative
terminal
the
cathode
he
called
the
separate
atoms
or
groups
of
atoms
into
which
bodies
undergoing
electrolysis
are
separated
the
radicals
or
ions
and
named
the
ions
which
appear
at
the
cathode
the
kathions
and
the
radicals
which
appear
at
the
anode
the
anions
there
were
many
other
researches
made
by
faraday
such
as
his
experiments
on
disruptive
electric
discharges
his
investigations
on
the
electric
eel
his
many
researches
on
the
phenomena
both
of
frictional
electricity
and
of
the
voltaic
pile
his
investigations
on
the
contact
and
chemical
theories
of
the
voltaic
pile
and
those
on
chemical
decomposition
by
frictional
electricity
these
are
but
some
of
the
mere
important
of
them
those
we
have
already
discussed
will
however
amply
suffice
to
show
the
value
of
his
work
rather
than
take
up
any
others
let
us
inquire
what
influence
if
any
the
various
groups
of
discoveries
we
have
already
discussed
have
exerted
on
the
electric
arts
and
sciences
in
our
present
time
what
practical
results
have
attended
these
discoveries
what
actual
useful
commercial
machines
have
been
based
on
them
what
useful
processes
or
industries
have
grown
out
of
them
and
first
as
to
actual
commercial
machines
these
researches
not
only
led
to
the
production
of
machines
but
in
point
of
fact
faraday
actually
produced
the
first
dynamo
a
machine
as
is
well
known
is
a
machine
by
means
of
which
mechanical
energy
is
converted
into
electrical
energy
by
causing
conductors
to
cut
through
or
be
cut
through
by
lines
of
magnetic
force
or
briefly
it
is
a
machine
by
means
of
which
electricity
is
readily
obtained
from
magnetism
faraday
invention
of
the
first
dynamo
is
interesting
because
at
the
same
time
he
made
the
invention
he
solved
a
problem
which
up
to
his
time
had
been
the
despair
of
the
ablest
physicists
and
mathematicians
this
was
the
phenomenon
of
arago
rotating
disc
it
was
briefly
as
follows
if
a
copper
disc
be
rotated
above
a
magnet
the
needle
tends
to
follow
the
plate
in
its
rotation
or
if
a
copper
plate
be
placed
at
rest
above
or
below
an
oscillating
magnet
it
tends
to
check
its
oscillations
and
bring
the
needle
quickly
to
rest
faraday
investigated
these
phenomena
and
soon
discovered
that
a
copper
disc
rotated
below
two
magnet
poles
had
electric
currents
generated
in
it
which
flowed
radially
through
the
disc
between
its
circumference
and
centre
by
placing
one
end
of
a
conducting
circuit
on
the
axis
of
the
disc
and
the
other
end
on
its
circumference
he
succeeded
in
drawing
off
a
continuous
electric
current
generated
from
magnetism
and
thus
produced
the
first
dynamo
this
was
in
faraday
produced
many
other
dynamos
besides
this
simple
disc
machine
although
the
disc
dynamo
in
its
original
form
was
impracticable
as
a
commercial
machine
yet
it
was
not
only
the
forerunner
of
the
dynamo
but
was
in
point
of
fact
the
first
machine
ever
produced
that
is
entitled
to
be
called
a
dynamo
he
generously
left
to
those
who
might
come
after
him
the
opportunity
to
avail
themselves
of
his
wonderful
discovery
i
have
rather
however
he
says
been
desirous
of
discovering
new
facts
and
new
relations
dependent
on
induction
than
of
exalting
the
force
of
those
already
obtained
being
assured
that
the
latter
would
find
their
development
hereafter
how
profoundly
prophetic
could
the
illustrious
investigator
see
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dynamos
that
are
in
all
parts
of
the
world
engaged
in
converting
millions
of
of
mechanical
energy
into
electric
energy
he
would
appreciate
how
marvellously
his
successors
have
exalted
the
force
of
some
of
the
effects
he
had
so
ably
shown
the
world
how
to
obtain
faraday
lived
to
see
his
infant
dynamo
the
first
of
its
kind
developed
into
a
machine
not
only
sufficiently
powerful
to
maintain
electric
arc
lights
but
also
into
a
form
sufficiently
practicable
to
be
continuously
engaged
in
producing
such
light
in
one
of
the
lighthouses
on
the
english
coast
holmes
produced
such
a
machine
in
or
some
years
before
faraday
death
it
was
installed
under
the
care
of
the
trinity
house
at
the
dungeness
lighthouse
in
june
and
continued
in
use
for
about
ten
years
when
this
machine
was
shown
to
faraday
by
its
inventor
the
veteran
philosopher
remarked
i
gave
you
a
baby
and
you
bring
me
a
giant
the
transformer
is
another
gift
of
faraday
to
the
commercial
world
as
is
well
known
this
instrument
is
a
device
for
raising
or
lowering
electric
pressure
the
name
is
derived
from
the
fact
that
the
instrument
is
capable
of
taking
in
at
one
pressure
the
electric
energy
supplied
to
it
and
giving
it
out
at
another
pressure
thus
transforming
it
faraday
produced
the
first
transformer
during
his
investigations
on
induction
the
modern
transformer
though
differing
markedly
in
minor
details
from
faraday
primitive
instrument
yet
in
general
details
is
essentially
identical
with
it
the
enormous
use
of
both
and
transformers
transformers
which
respectively
induce
currents
of
higher
and
of
lower
electromotive
forces
in
their
secondary
coils
than
are
passed
through
their
primaries
shows
the
great
practical
value
of
this
invention
the
wonderful
growth
of
the
commercial
applications
of
alternating
currents
during
the
past
few
decades
would
have
been
impossible
without
the
use
of
the
transformer
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
it
was
not
in
the
form
of
the
transformer
that
faraday
discovery
of
induction
was
first
utilized
but
in
the
form
of
a
transformer
or
what
was
then
ordinarily
called
an
induction
coil
as
early
as
masson
and
bréguet
constructed
an
induction
coil
by
means
of
which
minute
sparks
could
be
obtained
from
the
secondary
in
vacuo
in
ruhmkorff
constructed
an
induction
coil
so
greatly
improved
by
the
careful
insulation
of
its
secondary
circuit
that
he
could
obtain
from
it
torrents
of
long
sparks
in
ordinary
air
the
ruhmkorff
induction
coil
has
in
late
years
been
greatly
improved
both
by
tesla
and
elihu
thomson
who
separately
and
independently
of
each
other
have
produced
excellent
forms
of
induction
coils
induction
coils
have
long
been
in
use
for
purposes
of
research
and
in
later
years
have
been
employed
in
the
production
both
of
the
röntgen
rays
used
in
the
photography
of
the
invisible
and
the
waves
used
in
wireless
telegraphy
röntgen
discovery
was
published
in
it
was
rendered
possible
by
the
prior
work
of
geissler
and
crookes
on
the
luminous
phenomena
produced
by
the
passage
of
electric
discharges
through
high
vacua
in
glass
tubes
röntgen
discovered
that
the
invisible
rays
or
radiation
emitted
from
certain
parts
of
a
tube
when
discharges
from
induction
coils
were
passing
possessed
the
curious
property
of
traversing
certain
opaque
substances
as
readily
as
light
does
glass
or
water
he
also
discovered
that
these
rays
were
capable
of
exciting
fluorescence
in
some
substances
that
is
of
causing
them
to
emit
light
and
become
luminous
and
that
these
rays
like
the
rays
of
light
were
capable
of
affecting
a
photographic
plate
from
these
properties
two
curious
possibilities
arose
namely
to
see
through
opaque
bodies
and
to
photograph
the
invisible
röntgen
called
these
rays
x
or
unknown
rays
they
are
now
almost
invariably
called
by
the
name
of
their
distinguished
discoverer
let
us
briefly
investigate
how
it
is
possible
both
to
see
and
to
photograph
the
invisible
shortly
after
röntgen
discovery
edison
with
that
wonderful
power
of
finding
practical
applications
for
nearly
all
discoveries
had
invented
the
fluoroscope
a
screen
covered
with
a
peculiar
chemical
substance
that
becomes
luminous
when
exposed
to
the
röntgen
rays
suppose
now
between
the
rays
and
such
a
screen
be
interposed
a
substance
opaque
to
ordinary
light
as
for
example
the
human
hand
the
tissues
of
the
hand
such
as
the
flesh
and
the
blood
permit
the
rays
to
readily
pass
through
them
but
the
bones
are
opaque
to
the
rays
and
therefore
oppose
their
passage
consequently
the
screen
instead
of
being
uniformly
illumined
will
show
shadows
of
the
bones
so
that
to
an
eye
examining
the
screen
it
will
seem
as
though
it
were
looking
through
the
flesh
and
blood
directly
at
the
bones
in
a
similar
manner
if
a
photographic
plate
be
employed
instead
of
the
screen
a
distinct
photographic
picture
will
be
obtained
both
the
fluoroscope
and
the
photographic
camera
have
proved
an
invaluable
aid
to
the
surgeon
who
can
now
look
directly
through
the
human
body
and
examine
its
internal
organs
and
so
be
able
to
locate
such
foreign
bodies
as
bullets
and
needles
in
its
various
parts
or
make
correct
diagnoses
of
fractures
or
dislocations
of
the
bones
or
even
examine
the
action
of
such
organs
as
the
liver
and
heart
about
hertz
discovered
that
if
a
small
leyden
jar
is
discharged
through
a
short
and
simple
circuit
provided
with
a
of
suitable
length
a
series
of
waves
are
set
up
which
moving
through
space
in
all
directions
are
capable
of
exciting
in
a
similar
circuit
effects
that
can
be
readily
recognized
although
the
two
circuits
are
at
fairly
considerable
distances
apart
here
we
have
a
simple
basic
experiment
in
wireless
telegraphy
which
briefly
considered
consists
of
means
whereby
oscillations
or
waves
set
up
in
free
space
by
means
of
disruptive
discharges
are
caused
to
traverse
space
and
produce
various
effects
in
suitably
constructed
receptive
devices
that
are
operated
by
the
waves
as
they
impinge
on
them
at
first
a
doubt
was
expressed
by
eminent
scientific
men
as
to
the
practicability
of
successfully
transmitting
wireless
messages
through
long
distances
since
these
waves
travelling
in
all
directions
would
soon
become
too
attenuated
to
produce
intelligible
signals
but
when
it
was
shown
from
theoretical
considerations
that
these
waves
when
traversing
great
distances
are
practically
confined
to
the
space
between
the
earth
surface
and
the
upper
rarified
strata
of
the
atmosphere
the
possibility
of
wireless
telegraphic
transmission
was
recognized
to
increase
the
distance
it
was
only
necessary
either
to
increase
the
energy
of
the
waves
at
the
transmitting
station
or
to
increase
the
delicacy
of
the
receiving
instruments
or
both
it
has
been
but
a
short
time
since
both
the
scientific
and
the
financial
worlds
were
astounded
by
the
actual
transmission
of
intelligible
wireless
signals
across
the
atlantic
and
the
name
of
marconi
will
go
down
to
posterity
as
the
one
who
first
accomplished
this
great
feat
the
principal
limit
to
the
distance
of
transmission
lies
in
the
delicacy
of
the
receiving
instruments
the
most
sensitive
are
those
in
which
a
telephone
receiver
forms
a
part
of
the
receiving
apparatus
the
almost
incredibly
small
amount
of
electric
energy
required
to
produce
intelligible
speech
in
an
ordinary
bell
telephone
receiver
nearly
passes
belief
the
work
done
in
lifting
such
an
instrument
from
its
hook
to
the
ear
of
the
listener
would
if
converted
into
electric
energy
be
sufficient
to
maintain
an
audible
sound
in
a
telephone
for
years
even
extremely
attenuated
waves
may
therefore
produce
audible
signals
in
such
a
receiver
the
electric
motor
was
another
gift
of
faraday
to
commercial
science
although
in
this
case
there
are
others
who
can
perhaps
justly
claim
to
share
the
honor
with
him
faraday
early
electric
motor
consisted
essentially
in
a
device
whereby
a
movable
conductor
suspended
so
as
to
be
capable
of
rotation
around
a
magnet
pole
was
caused
to
rotate
by
the
mutual
interaction
of
the
magnetic
fields
of
the
active
conductor
and
the
magnet
the
magnet
which
consisted
of
a
bar
of
hardened
steel
was
fixed
in
a
cork
stopper
which
completely
closed
the
end
of
an
upright
glass
tube
a
small
quantity
of
mercury
was
placed
in
the
lower
end
of
the
tube
so
as
to
form
a
liquid
contact
for
the
lower
end
of
a
movable
wire
suspended
so
as
to
be
capable
of
rotating
at
its
lower
extremity
about
the
axis
of
the
tube
on
the
passage
of
an
electric
current
through
the
wire
a
continuous
rotary
motion
was
produced
in
it
the
direction
of
which
depends
both
on
the
direction
of
the
current
and
on
the
polarity
of
the
end
of
the
magnet
around
which
the
rotation
occurs
the
great
value
of
the
electric
motor
to
the
world
is
too
evident
to
need
any
proof
the
number
of
purposes
for
which
electric
motors
are
now
employed
is
so
great
that
the
actual
number
of
motors
in
daily
use
is
almost
incredible
and
every
year
sees
this
number
rapidly
increasing
the
above
are
the
more
important
machines
or
devices
that
have
been
directly
derived
from
faraday
great
investigation
as
to
the
production
of
electricity
from
magnetism
let
us
now
inquire
briefly
as
to
what
useful
processes
or
industries
have
been
rendered
possible
by
the
existence
of
these
machines
apparently
one
of
the
most
marked
requirements
of
our
civilization
is
that
man
shall
be
readily
able
to
extend
the
day
far
into
the
night
he
can
no
longer
go
to
sleep
when
the
sun
sets
and
keep
abreast
with
his
competitors
of
all
artificial
illuminants
yet
employed
the
arc
and
the
incandescent
electric
lights
are
unquestionably
the
best
whether
from
a
sanitary
aesthetic
or
truest
economical
standpoint
now
while
it
is
a
matter
of
record
that
both
arc
and
incandescent
lights
were
invented
long
before
faraday
time
yet
it
was
not
until
a
source
of
electricity
was
invented
superior
both
in
economy
and
convenience
to
the
voltaic
battery
that
either
of
these
lights
became
commercial
possibilities
such
an
electric
source
was
given
to
the
world
by
faraday
through
his
invention
of
the
machine
and
it
was
not
until
this
machine
was
sufficiently
developed
and
improved
that
commercial
electric
lighting
became
possible
the
energy
of
burning
coal
through
the
working
the
dynamo
is
far
cheaper
and
more
efficient
for
producing
electricity
than
the
consumption
of
metals
through
the
voltaic
pile
it
is
characteristic
of
the
modesty
of
faraday
that
when
in
he
heard
inventors
speaking
of
their
electric
lights
he
refrained
from
claiming
the
electric
light
as
his
own
although
without
the
machine
he
taught
the
world
how
to
construct
commercial
lighting
would
have
been
an
impossibility
the
marvellous
activity
in
the
electric
arts
and
sciences
which
followed
as
a
natural
result
of
faraday
giving
to
the
world
in
the
machine
a
cheap
electric
source
naturally
leads
to
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
at
a
somewhat
later
day
a
yet
greater
revolution
may
not
follow
the
production
of
a
still
cheaper
electric
source
in
point
of
fact
such
a
discovery
is
by
no
means
an
impossibility
when
a
machine
is
caused
to
produce
an
electric
current
by
the
intervention
of
a
the
transformation
of
energy
which
takes
place
from
the
energy
of
the
coal
to
electric
energy
is
an
extremely
wasteful
one
could
some
practical
method
be
discovered
by
means
of
which
the
burning
of
coal
liberates
electric
energy
instead
of
heat
energy
an
electric
source
would
be
discovered
that
would
far
exceed
in
economy
the
best
dynamo
in
existence
with
such
a
discovery
what
the
results
would
be
no
one
can
say
this
much
is
certain
that
it
would
among
other
things
relegate
the
to
the
and
solve
the
problem
of
aerial
navigation
what
is
justly
regarded
as
one
of
the
greatest
achievements
of
modern
times
is
the
electrical
transmission
of
power
over
comparatively
great
distances
at
some
cheap
source
of
energy
say
at
a
waterfall
a
is
employed
to
drive
a
dynamo
or
generator
thus
converting
mechanical
energy
into
electrical
energy
this
electricity
is
passed
over
a
conducting
line
to
a
distant
station
where
it
is
either
directly
utilized
for
the
purpose
of
lighting
heating
chemical
decomposition
or
indirectly
utilized
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
mechanical
power
for
driving
machinery
by
passing
it
through
an
electric
motor
the
electric
transmission
of
power
has
been
successfully
made
in
california
over
a
distance
of
some
miles
at
a
pressure
on
transmission
lines
of
volts
the
high
pressures
required
for
the
economical
use
of
transmission
lines
necessitates
the
employment
of
transformers
at
each
end
of
the
line
namely
transformers
at
the
transmitting
end
to
raise
the
voltage
delivered
by
the
generators
and
transformers
at
the
receiving
end
to
lower
it
for
use
in
the
various
translating
devices
these
transformers
are
employed
in
connection
with
dynamos
faraday
not
only
gave
to
the
world
the
first
electric
generator
but
also
the
first
transformer
and
one
of
the
first
electric
motors
and
without
these
gifts
the
electric
transmission
of
power
over
long
distances
which
has
justly
been
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
marvellous
achievements
of
our
age
would
have
been
an
impossibility
in
circuits
over
which
such
pressures
as
volts
is
transmitted
no
little
difficulty
is
experienced
from
leakage
and
consequent
loss
of
energy
this
leakage
occurs
both
between
the
line
conductors
and
at
the
insulators
placed
on
the
pole
lines
forming
the
line
circuit
the
insulators
are
made
either
of
glass
or
porcelain
and
are
of
a
peculiar
form
known
as
triple
petticoat
pattern
the
loss
on
such
lines
due
to
leakage
between
wires
is
greater
than
that
which
takes
place
at
the
pole
insulators
and
is
diminished
by
keeping
the
circuit
wires
as
far
apart
as
possible
in
the
early
history
of
the
art
electric
transmission
of
power
was
effected
by
means
of
generators
and
motors
generators
and
motors
through
which
the
current
always
passed
in
the
same
direction
such
generators
and
motors
however
possessed
inconveniences
that
prevented
extensive
commercial
transmission
of
power
since
as
we
have
seen
high
pressure
was
necessary
for
efficiency
in
such
transmission
and
the
and
commutators
employed
in
all
generators
and
motors
to
carry
the
current
from
the
machine
or
to
the
motor
were
a
constant
source
of
trouble
and
danger
when
the
motor
first
same
into
general
use
it
was
employed
in
connection
with
the
generator
in
electric
transmission
systems
but
such
motors
also
possess
the
inconvenience
of
not
readily
starting
from
a
state
of
rest
with
their
full
turning
power
or
torque
and
of
therefore
being
unsuitable
where
the
motor
requires
to
be
frequently
stopped
or
started
had
these
difficulties
remained
unsolved
electric
transmission
of
power
so
successful
in
operation
and
which
bids
fair
to
be
still
more
successful
in
the
near
future
would
have
been
impossible
fortunately
these
difficulties
were
overcome
by
the
genius
of
nikola
tesla
in
the
invention
of
the
multiphase
motor
or
the
induction
motor
as
it
is
now
generally
called
although
baily
deprez
and
ferraris
had
accomplished
much
before
tesla
time
yet
it
was
practically
to
the
investigations
and
discoveries
made
by
tesla
between
and
that
the
induction
motor
of
is
due
another
requirement
of
our
civilization
is
rapid
transit
either
urban
or
and
this
is
afforded
by
various
systems
of
electric
street
railways
or
electric
traction
generally
including
electric
locomotives
and
electric
automobiles
the
wonderful
growth
in
this
direction
which
has
been
witnessed
in
the
last
few
decades
would
have
been
impossible
without
the
electric
generator
and
motor
both
gifts
of
faraday
to
the
world
their
application
in
this
direction
must
therefore
go
to
swell
the
debt
our
civilization
owes
to
the
labors
of
this
great
investigator
in
the
system
of
electric
propulsion
very
generally
employed
a
single
trolley
wheel
is
employed
for
taking
the
driving
current
from
an
overhead
conductor
suspended
above
the
street
the
trolley
wheel
is
supported
by
a
trolley
pole
and
is
maintained
in
good
electric
contact
with
the
trolley
wire
or
overhead
conductor
by
this
means
the
current
passes
from
the
wire
down
the
conductor
connected
with
the
trolley
pole
thence
through
the
motors
placed
below
the
body
of
the
car
and
from
them
through
the
track
or
back
to
the
power
station
a
small
portion
of
the
current
is
employed
for
lighting
the
electric
lamps
in
the
car
in
some
systems
an
underground
trolley
is
employed
an
important
device
called
the
controller
is
employed
in
all
systems
of
electric
propulsion
it
consists
of
means
by
which
the
starting
and
stopping
of
the
car
and
changes
both
in
its
speed
and
direction
are
placed
under
the
control
of
the
motorman
a
separate
controller
is
placed
on
both
platforms
of
the
car
the
controller
consists
essentially
of
a
switch
by
means
of
which
the
several
motors
that
are
employed
in
all
street
cars
can
be
variously
connected
with
each
other
or
with
different
electric
resistances
or
can
be
successively
cut
out
or
introduced
into
the
circuit
so
that
the
speed
of
the
car
can
be
regulated
at
will
as
the
handle
of
the
controller
is
moved
by
the
motorman
to
the
various
notches
on
the
top
of
the
controller
box
as
generally
arranged
the
speed
increases
from
the
first
notch
or
starting
position
to
the
last
notch
movements
in
the
opposite
direction
changing
connections
in
the
opposite
order
of
succession
and
therefore
slowing
the
car
there
is
however
no
definite
speed
corresponding
to
each
notch
for
this
will
vary
with
the
load
on
each
car
and
with
the
gradient
upon
which
it
may
be
running
but
there
is
another
valuable
gift
received
by
the
world
as
a
result
of
this
great
discovery
of
faraday
namely
that
most
marvellous
instrument
of
modern
times
the
speaking
telephone
this
instrument
was
invented
in
by
philip
ries
and
subsequently
independently
reinvented
in
by
elisha
gray
and
alexander
graham
bell
as
is
well
known
it
is
electric
currents
and
not
that
are
transmitted
over
a
telephone
circuit
the
telephone
in
its
simplest
form
consists
of
a
pair
of
instruments
called
respectively
the
transmitter
and
the
receiver
we
talk
into
the
transmitter
and
listen
at
the
receiver
both
transmitter
and
receiver
consist
of
a
permanent
magnet
of
hardened
steel
around
one
end
of
which
is
placed
a
coil
of
insulated
wire
in
front
of
this
coil
a
diaphragm
or
thin
plate
of
soft
iron
is
so
supported
as
to
be
capable
of
freely
vibrating
towards
and
from
the
magnet
pole
the
operation
of
the
transmitting
instrument
is
readily
understood
in
the
light
of
faraday
discovery
it
is
simply
a
machine
driven
by
the
voice
of
the
speaker
as
the
from
the
speaker
voice
strike
against
the
diaphragm
which
has
become
magnetic
from
its
nearness
to
the
magnet
pole
electric
currents
are
generated
in
the
coil
of
wire
surrounding
such
pole
since
the
motions
cause
the
lines
of
force
to
pass
through
the
wire
on
the
moving
coil
the
operation
of
the
receiving
instrument
is
also
readily
understood
it
acts
as
an
electric
motor
driven
by
the
currents
generated
by
the
transmitter
as
these
currents
are
transmitted
over
the
wire
they
pass
through
the
coil
of
wire
on
the
receiving
instrument
and
reproduce
therein
the
exact
movements
of
the
transmitting
diaphragm
since
as
they
strengthen
or
weaken
the
magnetism
of
the
pole
they
cause
similar
motions
in
the
diaphragm
placed
before
it
consequently
one
listening
at
the
receiving
diaphragm
will
hear
all
that
is
uttered
into
the
transmitting
diaphragm
it
was
thus
by
the
combination
of
the
dynamo
and
motor
both
of
which
were
given
by
faraday
to
the
world
that
we
have
received
this
priceless
instrument
which
has
been
so
potent
in
its
effects
on
the
civilization
of
the
twentieth
century
the
electric
telegraph
had
its
beginnings
long
before
faraday
time
as
early
as
watson
had
erected
a
line
some
two
miles
in
length
extending
over
the
housetops
in
london
and
operated
it
by
means
of
discharges
from
an
ordinary
frictional
electric
machine
in
lesage
had
erected
in
geneva
an
electric
telegraph
consisting
of
a
number
of
metallic
wires
one
for
each
letter
of
the
alphabet
these
wires
were
carefully
insulated
from
each
other
when
a
message
was
to
be
sent
over
this
early
telegraphic
line
an
electric
discharge
was
passed
through
the
particular
wire
representing
the
letter
of
the
alphabet
to
be
sent
this
discharge
reaching
the
other
end
caused
a
pithball
to
be
repelled
and
thus
laboriously
letter
by
letter
the
message
was
transmitted
how
ludicrously
cumbersome
was
such
an
instrument
when
contrasted
with
the
morse
telegraph
of
which
requires
but
a
single
wire
or
with
the
harmonic
telegraph
of
gray
which
permits
the
simultaneous
transmission
of
eight
or
more
separate
messages
over
a
single
wire
or
with
the
wonderful
quadruplex
telegraphic
system
of
edison
which
permits
the
simultaneous
transmission
of
four
separate
and
distinct
messages
over
a
single
wire
two
in
one
direction
and
two
in
the
opposite
direction
at
the
same
time
or
with
the
still
more
wonderful
multiplex
telegraph
of
delaney
which
is
able
to
simultaneously
transmit
as
many
as
separate
messages
over
a
single
wire
in
one
direction
and
in
the
opposite
direction
these
achievements
have
been
possible
only
through
the
researches
and
discoveries
of
oersted
faraday
and
hosts
of
other
eminent
workers
for
it
was
the
rendered
possible
by
oersted
together
with
the
magnificent
discoveries
of
faraday
and
others
since
his
time
that
these
marvellous
advances
in
transmission
of
intelligence
have
become
possibilities
before
completing
this
brief
sketch
of
some
of
the
effects
that
faraday
work
has
had
on
the
practical
arts
and
sciences
let
us
briefly
examine
the
generating
plants
that
are
either
in
operation
or
construction
at
niagara
falls
some
idea
of
the
size
of
the
niagara
falls
generating
plant
on
the
american
side
may
be
gained
from
the
fact
that
there
have
already
been
installed
eleven
of
the
separate
generators
the
remaining
capacity
of
the
tunnel
will
permit
of
the
installation
of
additional
or
in
all
on
the
canadian
side
of
the
falls
another
great
plant
is
about
to
be
erected
with
an
ultimate
capacity
of
several
hundred
thousand
here
however
the
size
of
the
generating
unit
will
be
double
that
on
the
american
side
or
these
generators
will
be
wound
to
produce
an
electric
pressure
of
volts
raised
by
means
of
transformers
to
and
volts
according
to
the
distance
of
transmission
each
of
the
revolving
parts
of
these
machines
will
weigh
pounds
to
what
gigantic
proportions
has
the
little
infant
dynamo
of
faraday
grown
in
this
short
time
since
its
birth
the
low
rates
at
which
electric
power
can
be
sold
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
the
niagara
generating
plant
have
naturally
resulted
in
an
enormous
growth
of
the
industries
for
these
industries
could
never
otherwise
develop
into
extended
commercial
applications
of
the
total
output
of
say
at
the
niagara
falls
generating
plant
no
less
than
is
used
in
various
electrolytic
and
processes
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
some
of
the
more
important
consumers
of
the
electric
power
named
in
the
order
of
consumption
are
for
the
manufacture
of
the
following
products
calcium

his

have
bestowed
upon

here
we
have

the

that
he
gave
freely
to
the

the

even
find

enormous

power
produced
are
employing
it
in

on

of
the

in

much
to

of

surprises
may
have
in

for
the

comparatively
near

nearer
approach
to

govern

elementary
substances

under

influence
of
if
these
laws
ever
become
so
well
known
that
man
is
able
to
form
hi
his
laboratory
the
various
food
products
that
are
now
formed
naturally
in
plant
organisms
such
a
revolution
would
be
wrought
that
the
work
of
the
agriculturist
would
be
largely
transferred
to
the
some
little
has
already
been
done
in
the
direct
formation
of
some
vegetable
substances
such
as
camphor
the
peculiar
flavoring
substance
present
in
the
vanilla
bean
and
in
many
other
substances
should
such
discoveries
ever
reach
to
the
direct
formation
of
some
food
staple
the
importance
and
significance
of
the
discovery
would
be
almost
beyond
comprehension
but
while
the
direct
formation
of
food
products
is
yet
to
be
accomplished
on
a
practical
scale
the
problem
appears
to
be
nearing
actual
solution
in
an
indirect
manner
it
has
been
known
since
the
time
of
cavendish
in
that
small
quantities
of
nitric
acid
could
be
formed
directly
from
the
nitrogen
and
oxygen
of
the
atmosphere
by
the
passage
of
electric
sparks
but
heretofore
the
quantity
so
found
has
been
too
small
to
be
of
any
commercial
value
quite
recently
however
one
of
the
companies
at
niagara
falls
has
succeeded
in
commercially
solving
the
important
problem
of
the
fixation
of
the
nitrogen
of
the
atmosphere
it
being
claimed
that
the
cost
of
thus
producing
one
ton
of
commercial
nitric
acid
of
a
market
value
of
over
eighty
dollars
does
not
greatly
exceed
twenty
dollars
since
sodium
nitrate
can
readily
be
produced
by
the
process
and
its
value
as
a
fertilizer
of
is
too
well
known
to
need
comment
there
would
thus
to
a
limited
extent
be
indirectly
solved

sought
all

unsought

they
came
so
rapidly
from
all
portions
of

stagnation
was
the
state
of
medicine
when
the
nineteenth
century
opened
it
was
only
three
years
before
that
jenner
had
announced
and
demonstrated
the
protective
efficacy
of
vaccination
against
his
teaching
in
spite
of
the
vehement
cavillings
of
the
antis
of
his
day
gained
credence
readily
and
vaccination
speedily
became
recognized
and
was
constantly
resorted
to
but
hardly
any
attempt
at
perfecting
the
practice
was
made
until
after
more
than
fifty
years
had
elapsed
his
discovery
or
rather
his
proof
of
the
truth
of
a
rustic
tradition
fell
like
a
pebble
into
the
doldrums
the
ripple
soon
subsided
and
nobody
was
encouraged
to
start
another
at
the
present
time
such
an
announcement
would
be
promptly
followed
by
investigations
leading
up
to
such
doctrines
as
that
of
the
attenuation
of
viruses
and
that
of
antitoxines
but
the
times
were
not
ripe
for
anything
of
that
sort
medicine
reposed
on
tradition
or
at
best
gave
itself
only
to
such
plausibilities
in
the
way
of
innovation
as
were
cleverly
advocated
physicians
strove
not
to
advance
the

they
were

upon
exposure
to
cold
and
errors
of

as
amply
explanatory
of
all
diseases
not
plainly
infectious
the
medical
writers
who
were
most
revered
were
those
who
busied
themselves
with
nosology
that
is
to
say
the
naming
and
classifying
of
diseases
wonderful
were
the
onomatological
feats
performed
by
some
of
these
men
and
most
diverse
and
grotesque
were
the
data
on
which
they
founded
their
classifications
to
label
a
disease
was
high
art
to
cure
it
was
something
that

or
might

with

all
included
under
the
euphemism
of
lowering
measures
were
the
means
universally
resorted
to
and
reputed
sheet
anchors
some
advance
had
been
made
from
the
times
when
disease
had
been
looked
upon
as
an
entity
to
be
exorcised
but
it
was
still
so
far
regarded
as
a
material
thing
that
it
was
to
be
starved
out
but
the
century
was
not
out
of
its
second
decade
when
signs
of
an
awakening
from
this
lethargy
began
to
show
themselves
the
first
steps
naturally
were
along
preparatory
lines
and
for
those
we
are
largely
indebted
to
the
physicists
the
chemists
and
the
botanists
gross
anatomy
became
better
known
owing
for
the
most
part
to
more
enlightened
legislation
on
the
subject
of
the
dissection
of
the
human
body
minute
anatomy
histology
sprang
into
existence
as
the
result
of
improvements
of
the
compound
microscope
physiology
took
on
something
of
the
experimental
and
medication
was
rendered
far
less
gross
and
repulsive
by
the
isolation
of
the
active
principles
of
medicinal
plants
but
it
was
long
after
all
this
that
the
telling
strides
were
taken
up
to
within
the
memory
of
many
men
who
are
now
living
peritonitis
tortured
its
victims
to
death
said
peritonitis
being
often
interpreted
as
a
manifestation
of
rheumatism
for
example
and
no
interposition
was
attempted
against
it
whereas
we
now
know
perfectly
well
that
the
vast
majority
of
cases
of
peritonitis
are
due
to
local
septic
poisoning
and
for
the
most
part
quite
readily
remediable
by
the
removal
with
a
minimum
of
danger
of
the
organ
from
which
such
poisoning
arises
almost
always
the
vermiform
appendix
appendicitis
of
which
we
hear
so
much
nowadays
is
no
new
disease
it
is
simply
the
peritonitis
that
killed
so
many
people
in
former
times
but
while
no
person
would
now
maintain
that
this
disease
was
a
new
one
there
are
many
and
those
too
among
the
best
instructed
who
find
it
difficult
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
if
not
new
it
must
at
least
be
of
far
more
frequent
occurrence
than
formerly
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
however
that
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
in
past
years
it
ended
spontaneously
in
recovery
and
was
forgotten
two
features
of
the
progress
in
medicine
in
the
nineteenth
century
negative
as
they
may
seem
to
have
been
were
undoubtedly
potent
in
the
promotion
of
advance
they
were
the
recognition
of
the
fact
that
many
dangerous
diseases
are
and
the
experiment
of
the
expectant
treatment
the
result
of
the
first
of
them
was
to
teach
men
to
desist
from
futile
attempts
to
the
diseases
in
the
sense
of
cutting
them
short
in
their
course
and
the
expectant
treatment
followed
as
a
natural
consequence
it
was
a
method
of
managing
disease
rather
than
attempting
to
cure
it
there
was
no
interference
save
to
promote
the
patient
comfort
to
nourish
him
as
thoroughly
as
might
be
without
unduly
taxing
his
powers
and
to
meet
complications
as
they
arose
it
was
stooping
to
conquer
perhaps
but
it
was
a
policy
that
conduced
greatly
to
the
of
the
sick
improved
their
chances
of
recovery
and
enabled
physicians
to
study
disease
more
accurately
by
reason
of
its
course
not
being
rendered
irregular
by
meddlesome
medication
it
has
never
been
dropped
and
it
never
will
be
save
as
such
directly
curative
agents
as
the
antitoxines
are
made
available
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
except
for
gross
anatomy
and
operative
surgery
medicine
was
taught
almost
wholly
so
far
as
the
schools
were
concerned
by
means
of
didactic
lectures
the
drawing
capacity
of
a
professor
was
proportionate
rather
to
his
rhetorical
powers
and
to
the
persuasiveness
with
which
he
inculcated
the
views
peculiar
to
himself
than
to
the
amount
of
real
information
that
he
conveyed
to
the
students
although
the
apprentice
system
for
that
was
what
the
practice
of
students
attaching
themselves
to
individual
practitioners
whom
they
called
their
preceptors
virtually
amounted
to
in
many
instances
made
up
more
or
less
completely
for
the
lack
of
systematic
clinical
teaching
yet
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
it
amounted
to
little
more
than
the
preceptor
allowing
the
student
the
use
of
his
library
and
occasionally
examining
into
the
latter
diligence
and
intelligence
in
return
for
which
he
the
preceptor
required
an
annual
fee
and
exacted
from
the
student
such
minor
services
as
his
proficiency
enabled
him
to
render
it
is
true
the
students
walked
the
hospitals
drinking
in
some
great
man
utterances
but
they
did
it
in
droves
not
a
moiety
of
them
being
able
to
get
a
good
look
at
a
patient
unless
it
was
such
a
passing
glance
as
might
tell
them
that
the
patient
was
jaundiced
by
clinical
teaching
we
understand
teaching
not
in
glittering
generalities
but
in
the
concrete
either
at
the
bedside
as
the
word
originally
implied
or
at
least
with
the
patient
actually
present
to
illustrate
in
his
person
the
professor
descriptions
and
the
success
or
failure
of
the
treatment
employed
the
clinic
is
now
firmly
established
and
has
been
for
years
but
it
was
long
before
this
grand
result
was
attained
experimental
methods
of
study
gradually
came
into
vogue
particularly
in
the
domain
of
physiology
in
this
sphere
william
beaumont
of
the
united
states
army
was
a
pioneer
his
historic
experiments
on
alexis
martin
a
soldier
who
had
been
wounded
in
the
stomach
and
recovered
with
a
permanent
opening
into
that
organ
will
ever
rank
among
the
most
important
of
the
early
experimental
studies
of
digestion
it
was
not
long
before
claude
bernard
extended
similar
inquiries
to
the
other
functions
of
the
body
notably
those
of
the
nervous
system
and
since
his
time
there
has
been
a
long
array
of
brilliant
investigators
of
physiology
and
of
other
branches
of
science
tributary
to
medicine
experiments
on
living
animals
were
almost
the
only
means
of
carrying
on
these
researches
in
the
early
days
the
animals
employed
were
doubtless
put
to
a
great
deal
of
pain
perhaps
in
many
instances
to
unnecessary
suffering
and
an
altogether
laudable
feeling
of
humanity
has
led
good
people
to
band
themselves
together
for
the
purpose
of
putting
a
stop
to
vivisection
or
at
least
of
greatly
restricting
the
practice
and
of
freeing
it
from
all
avoidable
infliction
of
pain
these
praiseworthy
efforts
have
in
some
instances
been
carried
so
far
unfortunately
as
to
seriously
hamper
scientific
investigation
investigation
which
has
for
its
object
the
alleviation
of
human
suffering
and
the
saving
of
human
life
we
may
earnestly
deprecate
and
strive
to
prevent
wanton
reiteration
of
painful
experiments
for
purposes
of
demonstrating
anew
that
which
is
unquestioned
and
we
may
resort
to
all
possible
means
to
render
necessary
experiments
free
from
actual
pain
from
the
anguish
of
trepidation
we
can
seldom
relieve
the
poor
animals
but
let
us
not
block
the
wheels
of
scientific
progress
at
the
dawn
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
examine
a
sick
pulse
to
inspect
his
tongue
to
observe
his
breathing
to
interrogate
his
skin
by
our
sense
of
touch
and
to
try
to
make
his
statements
and
those
of
his
friends
fit
in
with
some
tenable
theory
of
the
nature
of
his
ailment
were
about
all
we
could
do
possibly
it
was
because
he
realized
to
an
uncommon
degree
the
tremendous
impediment
of
this
narrow
limitation
that
samuel
hahnemann
the
founder
of
homoeopathy
cut
the
gordian
knot
in
sheer
rebelliousness
and
proclaimed
as
he
virtually
did
that
a
diagnosis
was
not
necessary
to
the
successful
treatment
of
disease
but
that
one
only
needed
to
know
empirically
how
to
subdue
symptoms
meaning
mainly
if
not
solely
what
we
term
subjective
symptoms
those
of
which
the
patient
complains
as
opposed
to
those
that
we
ourselves
discover
but
the
physical
examination
of
the
sick
before
extremely
meagre
in
its
sphere
and
restricted
in
its
possibilities
was
destined
to
expand
before
many
years
into
the
minute
and
positive
physical
diagnosis
of
the
present
day
in
the
year
a
french
physician
réné
théophile
hyacinthe
laennec
achieved
undying
fame
by
publishing
to
the
world
an
account
of
his
labors
in
the
application
of
mediate
auscultation
and
of
percussion
to
the
diagnosis
of
the
diseases
of
the
chest
it
is
true
that
no
less
a
personage
than
the
father
of
medicine
hippocrates
is
reputed
to
have
practised
succussion
as
a
means
of
diagnosis
that
is
the
shaking
of
a
patient
as
one
would
shake
a
cask
to
ascertain
by
the
occurrence
or
of
a
splashing
sound
if
the
person
pleural
cavity
was
distended
partly
with
water
and
partly
with
air
it
is
probable
that
hippocrates
and
many
others
after
him
carried
the
physical
examination
of
the
chest
still
further
for
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
for
example
that
so
simple
a
device
as
that
of
thumping
a
partition
to
make
out
the
situation
of
a
joist
by
the
sound
evoked
should
not
early
have
been
applied
to
the
human
chest
but
be
this
as
it
may
to
laennec
belongs
the
great
credit
of
having
laid
a
substantial
foundation
for
the
physical
diagnosis
of
the
present
time
and
more
than
for
laying
a
foundation
for
constructing
a
fairly
complete
edifice
he
who
should
now
undertake
to
practise
general
medicine
without
having
first
made
himself
proficient
in
the
detection
and
interpretation
of
the
sounds
elicited
by
auscultation
and
percussion
in
diseases
of
the
heart
and
lungs
would
foredoom
himself
to
failure
it
was
not
until
many
years
later
early
in
the
second
half
of
the
century
that
the
clinical
thermometer
came
into
general
use
but
it
soon
showed
most
strikingly
the
superiority
of
the
instrument
of
precision
to
the
unaided
senses
of
man
who
would
think
now
of
trying
to
estimate
the
height
of
a
fever
by
laying
his
hand
on
the
skin
or
who
even
among
the
laity
would
be
satisfied
with
such
a
procedure
doubtless
said
the
present
writer
in
a
former
publication
new
york
medical
journal
the
use
of
the
thermometer
has
occasionally
given
rise
to
needless
alarm
but
almost
invariably
it
may
be
interpreted
with
great
certainty
often
it
dispels
unnecessary
anxiety
as
in
a
twinkling
by
its
negative
indication
and
surely
it
is
to
be
credited
with
being
distinctly
diagnostic
in
those
diseases
of
which
it
has
itself
established
the
by
the
thermometric
curve
of
a
disease
is
understood
the
general
visual
impression
made
by
the
graphic
chart
of
a
temperature
record
the
course
of
a
zigzag
line
connecting
the
points
indicated
by
the
various
individual
observations
numerous
other
instruments
of
precision
are
now
in
constant
use
among
the
most
wonderful
of
which
perhaps
is
the
ophthalmoscope
whereby
we
are
enabled
to
subject
the
retina
and
the
intervening
media
of
the
eye
to
minute
visual
examination
there
is
not
an
organ
of
the
body
that
is
not
now
interrogated
daily
in
the
way
of
physical
diagnosis
and
we
even
examine
separately
the
secretion
of
each
of
the
two
kidneys
in
addition
there
are
multitudinous
specific
signs
of
which
we
were
not
long
ago
in
complete
ignorance
to
cite
only
one
of
these
there
is
widal
agglutination
test
by
which
the
bacteriologist
can
usually
make
a
diagnosis
of
typhoid
fever
far
in
advance
of
the
time
at
which
it
could
otherwise
be
distinguished
the
use
of
the
röntgen
rays
in
diagnosis
was
one
of
the
crowning
achievements
of
the
century
and
now
we
seem
about
to
enter
upon
a
course
of
their
successful
employment
in
the
treatment
of
disease
even
some
forms
of
cancer
as
well
as
in
its
detection
beyond
the
vermin
that
infest
the
skin
and
the
hair
tapeworm
and
a
few
other
intestinal
worms
little
if
anything
was
known
of
morbific
parasites
before
the
nineteenth
century
but
the
labors
of
van
beneden
küchenmeister
cobbold
manson
laveran
and
others
have
now
established
the
causal
relationship
between
great
numbers
of
animal
parasites
gross
and
microscopic
and
certain
definite
morbid
states
this
has
led
to
a
great
increase
in
our
knowledge
of
the
connection
between
the
parasites
of
the
lower
animals
and
grave
disease
in
human
beings
and
on
this
knowledge
rest
many
of
the
precautions
that
we
are
now
able
to
take
against
the
spread
of
such
disease
from
the
consideration
of
animal
parasites
as
the
direct
causes
of
disease
we
naturally
come
to
the
contemplation
of
the
subject
of
insects
as
the
carriers
of
disease
the
later
years
of
the
century
have
witnessed
the
demonstration
of
the
agency
in
the
transmission
of
malignant
pustule
and
typhoid
fever
and
that
of
certain
mosquitoes
in
the
conveyance
of
yellow
fever
and
malarial
disease
we
now
know
that
bad
air
the
original
meaning
of
the
word
has
nothing
to
do
with
fever
and
ague
and
that
swamps
are
not
unwholesome
if
they
are
free
from
infected
mosquitoes
the
mosquito
does
not
originate
the
malarial
infection
it
simply
serves
as
the
temporary
host
of
the
which
is
the
cause
of
the
disease
having
obtained
its
transient
guest
from
some
human
being
consequently
marshy
districts
that
are
full
of
mosquitoes
are
not
malarious
unless
the
mosquitoes
are
of
the
kinds
capable
of
lodging
the
plasmodium
and
unless
there
is
or
has
recently
been
present
in
the
neighborhood
some
person
affected
with
malarial
disease
moreover
the
most
virulently
malarious
region
is
a
safe
place
of
residence
for
human
beings
provided
they
protect
themselves
absolutely
against
the
bite
of
the
mosquito
this
has
been
strikingly
demonstrated
in
the
case
of
the
roman
campagna
from
the
animal
parasites
we
come
now
to
those
that
are
believed
to
be
of
vegetable
nature
under
the
general
name
of
there
are
multitudes
of
having
pathogenic
powers
each
giving
rise
to
some
definite
specific
disease
and
certain
associations
of
different
bacteria
causing
particular
morbid
conditions
generations
ago
physicians
had
a
glimmering
of
what
we
now
term
the
germ
theory
of
disease
as
was
shown
by
their
use
of
such
expressions
as
and
morbid
poisons
even
the
definite
relationship
of
special
microscopic
organisms
to
individual
diseases
was
foreshadowed
by
salisbury
nearly
fifty
years
ago
but
it
was
not
until
years
after
those
conceptions
and
in
no
wise
descended
from
or
led
up
to
by
them
that
an
intelligible
and
satisfactory
germ
theory
of
disease
was
formulated
it
is
to
pasteur
the
immortal
chemist
that
we
owe
this
theory
as
well
as
that
of
the
attenuation
of
viruses
both
of
more
than
theoretical
import
since
they
have
given
us
aseptic
surgery
the
power
of
frequently
preventing
hydrophobia
the
antitoxine
treatment
of
diphtheria
and
the
ability
to
stay
the
hand
of
death
in
the
form
of
many
a
stalking
pestilence
every
infectious
disease
is
now
held
to
be
due
to
its
own
particular
and
many
diseases
that
were
not
until
recently
thought
to
be
infectious
are
now
classed
as
such
because
they
have
been
proved
to
be
caused
by
living
germs
conspicuous
among
these
diseases
is
pulmonary
consumption
in
the
case
of
almost
every
one
of
these
diseases
we
have
discovered
the
specific
germ
and
are
able
to
demonstrate
its
presence
either
by
its
microscopical
appearance
by
its
behavior
on
contact
with
certain
stains
or
by
the
forms
that
cultures
of
it
assume
the
of
and
that
of
cancer
the
existence
of
which
is
assumed
have
not
yet
been
isolated
some
of
these
germs
like
that
of
tetanus
lockjaw
gain
entrance
to
the
system
only
through
a
wound
others
like
those
of
typhoid
fever
and
cholera
are
swallowed
others
like
that
of
pneumonia
are
inhaled
still
others
like
that
of
tuberculous
disease
are
either
swallowed
or
inhaled
some
are
believed
to
be
transmissible
to
the
unborn
child
and
a
few
are
ordinarily
harmless
parasites
becoming
pathogenic
only
when
they
accidentally
gain
access
to
other
parts
of
the
system
than
those
which
constitute
their
natural
habitat
these
microscopic
organisms
do
not
by
their
mere
presence
set
up
disease
unless
indeed
they
are
in
such
overwhelming
numbers
as
to
block
the
capillary
blood
vessels
mechanically
some
of
them
are
carried
broadcast
in
the
blood
current
while
others
remain
at
the
point
of
entrance
in
either
case
they
elaborate
certain
products
termed
toxines
which
act
either
locally
or
through
the
circulation
to
cause
the
disease
these
toxines
eventually
kill
the
that
produced
them
quite
as
an
animal
may
be
smothered
in
its
own
exhalations
or
at
least
they
would
do
so
if
the
host
survived
long
enough
for
the
completion
of
the
process
meantime
they
have
either
killed
the
host
or
been
defeated
by
certain
very
interesting
natural
processes
but
before
either
of
these
occurrences
has
had
time
to
take
place
fortunately
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
save
those
of
exposure
to
the
most
deadly
of
infections
the
vital
power
of
the
invaded
individual
has
coped
successfully
with
the
invaders
at
the
very
point
of
attack
has
repulsed
the
attacking
party
without
appreciable
impairment
of
its
own
force
and
no
illness
results
for
example
practically
all
of
us
inhale
the
germ
of
consumption
repeatedly
but
most
of
us
suffer
no
harm
from
it
simply
because
the
fluids
which
bathe
the
surface
on
which
the
germ
effects
a
lodgment
are
endowed
with
properties
which
either
kill
the
germ
or
rob
it
of
its
power
for
harm
but
these
properties
suffice
only
when
the
general
health
is
unimpaired
in
case
the
attack
is
not
successfully
repelled
at
the
outset
what
happens
there
begins
a
struggle
between
the
invaders
and
what
may
be
called
the
reserves
of
the
organism
consisting
of
the
white
blood
corpuscles
which
undergo
a
great
augmentation
in
number
these
corpuscles
are
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
amoeboid
movement
that
is
to
say
they
may
shoot
out
projections
from
their
substance
and
even
convert
themselves
for
the
time
being
into
traps
seizing
upon
the
pathogenic
bacteria
incarcerating
them
within
their
own
mass
and
carrying
them
away
to
be
thrust
out
of
the
system
by
organs
whose
function
it
is
to
eliminate
extraneous
matter
these
corpuscles
are
indeed
said
figuratively
to
the
malign
whence
they
have
been
termed
phagocytes
from
greek
phagein
to
eat
and
greek
kutos
a
cell
also
because
they
carry
away
refuse
and
noxious
material
they
have
been
called
the
scavengers
of
the
system
by
means
of
their
amoeboid
movement
they
are
enabled
to
worm
themselves
through
inconceivably
minute
apertures
in
the
blood
vessels
and
attack
and
devour
peccant
matter
wherever
it
may
have
effected
a
lodgment
these
white
corpuscles
are
also
known
as
leucocytes
and
their
increase
in
number
when
they
are
called
upon
to
resist
bacterial
invasion
is
spoken
of
as
hyperleucocytosis
the
discovery
of
their
protective
function
is
to
be
credited
to
metchnikoff
a
russian
physician
now
teaching
in
paris
when
they
migrate
from
the
blood
vessels
in
great
numbers
they
finally
after
having
fulfilled
their
office
as
phagocytes
degenerate
into
the
corpuscular
elements
of
pus
which
is
the
creamy
liquid
contained
in
an
abscess
their
migratory
power
was
discovered
by
cohnheim
but
as
a
general
thing
the
phagocytes
do
not
succeed
in
making
away
with
all
the
pathogenic
germs
or
even
with
enough
of
them
to
prevent
the
illness
which
they
tend
to
produce
the
further
combat
is
between
the
poisonous
products
termed
toxines
engendered
by
the
bacteria
and
certain
antidotal
substances
called
antitoxines
newly
created
in
the
watery
portion
of
the
blood
by
some
wonderful
provision
of
nature
that
is
not
yet
well
understood
each
infective
disease
has
its
special
toxine
and
for
the
destruction
of
each
the
blood
prepares
its
particular
antitoxine
possibly
however
some
of
the
antitoxines
may
be
efficacious
against
more
than
one
kind
of
toxine
for
there
are
physicians
who
are
convinced
that
vaccination
is
a
temporary
preventive
of
but
the
elaboration
of
an
antitoxine
takes
time
and
the
result
in
any
given
case
whether
in
recovery
or
in
death
seems
to
be
settled
by
the
ability
or
inability
of
the
vital
powers
of
the
individual
to
hold
out
until
they
are
relieved
by
the
evolution
of
the
necessary
amount
of
antitoxine
in
the
long
run
provided
the
sick
person
survives
more
antitoxine
is
generated
than
is
required
to
save
life
the
excess
remains
in
the
system
for
a
greater
or
lesser
length
of
time
and
this
fact
explains
the
individual
subsequent
immunity
to
the
disease
from
which
he
has
recovered
any
fresh
invading
force
of
the
microbes
of
that
disease
finds
that
defensive
preparations
have
been
made
in
advance
in
the
case
of
some
diseases
this
acquired
immunity
is
usually
lifelong
as
in
that
of
in
others
of
which
influenza
is
a
notable
example
it
is
as
a
rule
very
transitory
and
there
are
all
gradations
between
the
two
it
is
thought
that
this
acquired
immunity
to
some
diseases
may
be
transmitted
to
the
offspring
for
it
is
quite
certain
that
there
are
many
people
who
are
from
birth
insusceptible
to
scarlet
fever
no
matter
what
may
be
the
extent
of
their
exposure
to
that
disease
the
recognition
of
nature
elaboration
of
protective
antitoxines
has
led
to
their
artificial
cultivation
in
the
lower
animals
and
thus
produced
they
have
been
used
with
brilliant
results
in
the
prevention
and
cure
of
at
least
one
formidable
disease
diphtheria
the
immense
reduction
of
the
mortality
from
this
disease
that
has
followed
the
introduction
of
the
treatment
with
the
artificial
antitoxine
we
owe
to
behring
of
germany
and
roux
of
france
omitting
unnecessary
details
we
may
describe
the
process
of
obtaining
diphtheria
antitoxine
as
follows
a
certain
amount
of
diphtheritic
poison
of
the
bacteriological
sort
prepared
by
cultivating
the
diphtheria
microbe
is
injected
into
the
circulation
of
a
horse
sufficient
to
make
the
horse
sick
but
not
enough
to
endanger
his
life
the
horse
system
straightway
begins
to
elaborate
the
protective
antitoxine
and
there
results
from
this
one
injection
a
sufficient
amount
of
it
to
save
the
horse
although
far
too
little
to
make
the
serum
of
his
blood
potent
enough
for
medicinal
use
hence
after
the
lapse
of
a
suitable
interval
he
is
again
injected
with
diphtheritic
poison
and
for
the
second
time
his
blood
begins
to
generate
the
antitoxine
and
the
process
is
repeated
again
and
again
the
virulence
of
the
poison
being
increased
each
time
until
the
blood
is
fairly
reeking
with
antitoxine
then
blood
is
drawn
freely
from
the
horse
and
it
is
allowed
to
separate
into
clot
and
serum
the
latter
alone
being
the
part
destined
for
use
this
serum
is
tested
on
a
small
animal
that
has
been
inoculated
with
a
deadly
dose
of
the
diphtheritic
poison
if
it
saves
the
little
creature
from
death
it
is
assumed
to
be
potent
enough
for
use
on
human
beings
and
handled
with
all
possible
precautions
against
putrefaction
or
any
contamination
with
pathogenic
bacteria
it
is
furnished
to
physicians
its
degree
of
potency
being
designated
in
units
if
in
this
brief
article
which
does
not
purport
to
be
more
than
a
sketch
of
the
tremendous
strides
made
by
medicine
in
the
nineteenth
century
so
much
space
has
been
given
to
the
germ
theory
of
disease
it
is
because
the
demonstration
of
the
truth
of
that
theory
has
been
absolute
and
has
constituted
the
very
marrow
of
almost
all
the
medical
progress
of
the
century
that
has
been
the
outcome
of
continuous
thought
and
study
as
opposed
to
chance
discovery
such
results
as
the
germ
theory
has
now
led
to
in
the
treatment
of
diphtheria
it
had
already
accomplished
in
the
field
of
surgery
as
a
consequence
of
that
strict
asepticism
which
originating
with
joseph
lister
now
lord
lister
and
rapidly
carried
by
him
to
a
condition
verging
on
technical
completeness
was
soon
taken
up
by
surgeons
all
over
the
world
and
brought
wellnigh
to
perfection
so
that
the
mortality
of
wounds
of
all
sorts
has
been
tremendously
reduced
and
many
surgical
operations
are
now
practised
frequently
indeed
whenever
the
occasion
for
them
arises
that
before
the
days
of
listerism
would
have
been
looked
upon
as
almost
tantamount
to
the
patient
more
particularly
is
this
the
case
as
to
operations
which
involve
opening
into
the
abdomen
the
chest
or
the
cranium
so
little
risk
now
attaches
to
such
operations
properly
performed
that
the
opening
of
the
abdominal
cavity
for
the
mere
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
condition
of
its
contents
exploratory
laparotomy
as
it
is
called
is
a
matter
of
constant
occurrence
curiously
enough
in
some
way
not
yet
satisfactorily
explained
that
procedure
in
itself
without
anything
further
being
done
has
in
many
instances
resulted
in
decided
amelioration
of
a
morbid
condition
if
not
in
its
cure
a
striking
example
of
this
is
seen
in
the
benefit
that
often
results
in
cases
of
one
form
of
consumption
of
the
bowels
namely
tuberculous
disease
of
the
membrane
that
lines
the
abdominal
wall
and
invests
the
abdominal
organs
this
is
not
the
only
operation
that
does
good
mysteriously
that
of
cutting
out
a
bit
of
the
iris
in
a
form
of
eye
disease
glaucoma
that
tends
toward
complete
blindness
is
hardly
more
explicable
neither
is
an
incision
of
the
capsule
of
the
kidney
for
certain
forms
of
bright
disease
each
of
which
stays
the
progress
of
the
trouble
in
a
goodly
proportion
of
instances
another
of
the
great
divisions
of
the
healing
art
that
of
midwifery
has
been
enhanced
quite
as
much
as
general
surgery
by
the
employment
of
listerism
the
process
of
childbirth
although
a
perfectly
natural
one
almost
necessarily
carries
with
it
a
certain
amount
of
laceration
and
through
the
wound
surfaces
thus
produced
absorption
of
poisonous
material
was
formerly
so
frequent
that
puerperal
fever
figured
prominently
in
mortality
reports
it
was
oliver
wendell
holmes
a
graduate
in
medicine
and
a
professor
in
the
harvard
medical
school
though
we
are
accustomed
to
think
of
him
only
as
a
delightful
writer
who
first
declared
that
puerperal
fever
was
the
product
of
infection
from
without
the
body
and
semmelweis
demonstrated
the
truth
of
the
proposition
holmes
was
a
teacher
of
physiology
and
his
study
of
that
branch
of
medical
science
was
in
itself
enough
to
convince
him
of
the
doctrine
which
he
inculcated
listerism
must
be
credited
not
only
with
having
added
immensely
to
the
safety
of
the
major
operations
of
surgery
but
also
with
having
led
to
great
improvement
of
their
technics
by
reason
of
the
greatly
increased
frequency
with
which
it
has
come
to
be
thought
justifiable
to
practise
them
what
we
do
again
and
again
we
are
apt
in
the
end
to
do
well
whereas
that
which
we
turn
to
only
in
despair
and
as
rarely
as
possible
we
do
clumsily
and
imperfectly
listerism
has
been
unjustly
alleged
by
a
few
to
be
unworthy
of
the
appreciation
in
which
it
is
held
by
the
great
majority
of
medical
men
of
all
countries
simple
cleanliness
it
has
been
urged
is
quite
as
efficient
as
the
full
listerian
precautions
this
is
begging
the
question
for
simple
cleanliness
chemical
cleanliness
is
all
that
listerism
purports
to
accomplish
the
use
of
antiseptics
has
been
decried
in
the
interest
of
asepticism
as
if
the
whole
purpose
of
antisepticism
were
not
to
secure
asepsis
lord
lister
is
entitled
to
the
full
credit
of
establishing
the
aseptic
surgery
of
the
present
day
in
spite
of
the
facts
that
his
doctrine
followed
rather
than
preceded
his
early
improvements
that
aseptic
procedures
have
been
brought
nearer
perfection
elsewhere
than
in
his
own
country
and
that
the
whole
system
rests
on
foundations
laid
by
pasteur
while
it
is
quite
true
that
to
the
listerian
theory
and
practice
are
almost
wholly
to
be
ascribed
the
favorable
results
of
the
major
surgery
of
the
present
day
we
must
not
forget
the
immeasurable
benefits
to
the
diseased
the
injured
and
the
crippled
that
have
arisen
from
patient
efforts
and
occasional
brilliant
intuition
that
have
had
no
connection
with
the
germ
theory
of
infection
take
the
case
of
a
broken
leg
for
example
an
injury
that
formerly
condemned
the
victim
to
weeks
and
weeks
of
confinement
to
bed
together
with
the
suffering
and
danger
almost
inseparable
from
the
old
methods
of
the
long
straight
splint
and
tight
bandaging
at
the
present
time
he
who
has
met
with
such
a
misfortune
is
commonly
able
to
be
about
on
crutches
within
a
few
days
and
his
broken
bone
mends
while
he
is
cultivating
his
appetite
and
indulging
in
pleasant
intercourse
with
his
this
great
change
has
been
made
possible
by
one
device
after
another
invented
by
different
men
josiah
crosby
introduced
the
use
of
for
extension
instead
of
the
chafing
bands
previously
employed
gurdon
buck
substituted
elastic
extension
by
means
of
a
weight
and
pulley
for
the
rude
and
arbitrary
traction
in
vogue
before
james
little
devised
the
splint
whereby
broken
bones
were
immobilized
with
hardly
appreciable
discomfort
and
henry
sands
established
the
safety
and
practicability
of
applying
the
splint
almost
immediately
after
the
reduction
setting
of
the
fracture
in
the
meantime
nathan
smith
and
john
hodgen
had
demonstrated
the
advantages
of
suspending
a
fractured
limb
from
above
all
these
men
were
americans
surely
our
country
has
contributed
powerfully
to
the
of
the
subjects
of
fracture
other
americans
notably
lewis
sayre
have
enabled
sufferers
with
joint
disease
including
the
dreaded
hip
disease
to
run
about
and
gain
health
and
strength
instead
of
languishing
in
bed
sayre
too
by
his
suspension
treatment
and
the
jacket
set
the
hunchback
on
his
feet
at
a
stage
in
his
disease
in
which
before
he
had
been
forced
to
prolonged
and
painful
recumbency
although
men
professing
special
skill
in
certain
operations
and
doubtless
possessing
it
flourished
in
old
times
and
left
more
or
less
of
their
impress
on
the
surgery
of
the
present
day
for
that
matter
it
was
not
until
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
regional
surgery
which
is
what
specialism
virtually
amounts
to
was
systematically
cultivated
now
there
is
hardly
a
portion
of
the
body
to
which
practitioners
who
make
its
ailments
a
specialty
do
not
direct
their
searching
methods
of
examination
or
on
which
they
do
not
practise
their
ingenious
devices
in
the
way
of
treatment
specialism
has
always
been
decried
by
a
large
section
of
the
medical
profession
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
and
is
still
overrated
by
the
laity
the
true
estimate
lies
between
the
two
the
specialists
have
advanced
surgery
immensely
but
with
many
honorable
exceptions
they
have
laid
too
much
stress
on
their
several
specialties
making
too
wide
a
range
of
ailments
fall
within
them
as
for
the
community
at
large
their
shortcoming
lies
in
the
fact
that
most
of
them
would
seek
for
a
specialist
in
mumps
in
case
that
painful
but
transitory
infliction
were
to
come
upon
them
and
in
their
underrating
of
the
family
physician
to
change
for
a
moment
to
a
topic
akin
to
the
germ
theory
of
disease
the
reader
may
be
reminded
that
the
antitoxine
treatment
of
infectious
disease
involves
in
almost
every
instance
the
use
of
some
product
contained
in
the
serum
that
is
to
say
the
watery
part
of
the
blood
this
leads
to
the
subject
of
the
use
of
natural
and
artificial
serum
in
the
treatment
of
disease
to
quote
again
from
the
article
entitled
the
nineteenth
century
in
medicine
new
york
medical
journal
it
has
been
observed
that
the
normal
serum
of
certain
animals
that
are
insusceptible
to
particular
infectious
diseases
if
injected
into
the
human
blood
current
or
even
into
the
subcutaneous
tissue
confers
more
or
less
of
immunity
against
those
diseases
artificial
serum
seems
to
have
been
first
employed
by
edmund
peaslee
as
a
benign
application
to
the
peritonaeum
in
the
operation
of
ovariotomy
his
conception
of
its
mode
of
action
is
not
very
clear
but
he
was
a
very
successful
ovariotomist
and
we
can
only
conjecture
that
he
builded
better
than
he
knew
like
many
another
man
a
few
years
ago
much
was
expected
from
transfusion
of
blood
but
gradually
the
conviction
has
forced
itself
upon
us
that
it
is
wellnigh
useless
and
indeed
that
on
the
whole
it
is
worse
than
useless
it
has
virtually
been
abandoned
but
experiments
in
transfusion
have
not
been
fruitless
they
have
culminated
in
demonstrating
the
inestimable
value
of
infusions
of
or
solutions
of
sodium
chloride
and
not
only
of
infusions
but
also
of
peritoneal
irrigation
with
such
solutions
many
a
life
has
been
saved
by
resorting
to
this
measure
even
in
apparently
desperate
cases
within
about
a
decade
of
the
close
of
the
century
robert
koch
whose
discoveries
and
ingenious
studies
in
bacteriology
had
brought
him
renown
announced
that
he
had
produced
a
derivative
of
the
tubercle
bacillus
which
he
termed
tuberculin
that
he
thought
might
prove
curative
of
tuberculous
disease
it
was
to
be
injected
beneath
the
skin
if
the
subject
was
really
tuberculous
he
would
react
by
manifesting
a
certain
degree
of
fever
and
repeated
injections
would
bring
about
elimination
of
the
tuberculous
deposits
and
thus
effect
a
cure
the
world
was
carried
away
with
such
an
announcement
coming
from
such
a
man
and
it
was
thoroughly
believed
that
at
last
the
great
white
plague
consumption
was
to
be
conquered
tuberculin
did
indeed
cure
certain
minor
forms
of
tuberculous
disease
such
as
the
skin
affection
known
as
lupus
but
it
soon
became
evident
that
it
was
almost
impotent
in
the
treatment
of
pulmonary
consumption
it
has
however
served
to
enable
the
veterinarian
to
make
out
the
existence
of
tuberculous
disease
in
cattle
at
an
early
stage
of
its
course
and
it
is
probable
that
by
the
slaughter
of
cattle
thus
found
to
be
tuberculous
much
infection
of
human
beings
has
been
prevented
tuberculin
failed
of
its
prime
purpose
but
it
does
seem
to
have
marked
the
initiative
of
a
campaign
against
consumption
which
has
already
proved
of
incalculable
benefit
and
bids
fair
to
put
that
omnipresent
disease
toward
the
foot
of
the
list
of
causes
of
death
we
have
made
substantial
advances
in
our
knowledge
of
the
disease
and
we
no
longer
regard
it
as
incurable
we
have
learned
that
it
is
communicable
from
one
person
to
another
but
also
that
its
communication
can
easily
be
prevented
so
that
there
is
no
reason
to
shrink
from
association
with
tuberculous
persons
we
have
learned
too
that
consumption
in
progenitors
immediate
or
remote
hardly
makes
it
even
probable
that
he
himself
is
doomed
to
suffer
with
it
the
only
tuberculous
heredity
that
we
now
recognize
is
that
of
defective
ability
to
withstand
the
infection
and
even
this
we
regard
as
in
most
instances
readily
surmountable
we
have
learned
furthermore
that
pulmonary
tuberculous
disease
is
by
no
means
so
fatal
as
it
was
formerly
esteemed
for
men
whose
business
it
is
to
make
great
numbers
of
examinations
such
as
coroners
physicians
and
hospital
pathologists
assure
us
that
in
a
very
large
percentage
of
cases
of
death
from
other
causes
they
find
indubitable
signs
of
past
tuberculous
disease
of
the
lungs
which
had
ceased
its
activity
been
in
fact
cured
either
spontaneously
or
by
medical
intervention
such
intervention
it
has
been
abundantly
proved
is
altogether
likely
to
be
successful
if
it
is
of
the
right
sort
and
employed
early
there
is
to
be
sure
no
powerful
as
the
climatic
treatment
is
it
must
be
supplemented
by
measures
accurately
adapted
to
the
individual
case
and
failure
to
comprehend
this
fact
still
leads
many
a
phthisical
person
to
his
grave
but
information
is
rapidly
being
diffused
sanatoria
for
such
of
the
tuberculous
as
can
take
advantage
of
them
are
multiplying
and
those
who
are
shut
off
from
their
aid
are
growing
more
and
more
cognizant
of
how
they
should
live
in
order
to
give
themselves
the
best
chance
of
recovery
and
save
their
associates
from
infection
the
era
of
meaning
drugs
is
past
but
the
disease
is
cured
in
an
proportion
of
instances
and
that
too
by
medical
though
not
medicinal
measures
at
almost
every
turn
medicine
has
been
powerfully
assisted
by
the
sciences
which
should
rather
be
termed
correlative
than
subsidiary
notable
among
them
is
chemistry
the
isolation
of
the
active
principles
of
medicinal
plants
such
as
morphine
quinine
strychnine
and
cocaine
has
been
a
remarkable
service
rendered
by
chemistry
to
medicine
how
should
we
be
handicapped
if
we
still
had
to
fight
malarial
disease
with
the
crude
peruvian
bark
instead
of
its
chief
alkaloid
quinine
and
how
impracticable
if
not
impossible
would
it
be
to
render
the
eye
insensitive
to
pain
with
any
extract
of
coca
leaves
no
matter
how
concentrated
a
purpose
that
we
accomplish
almost
instantly
with
cocaine
of
minor
importance
perhaps
but
not
to
be
despised
is
the
resulting
liberation
from
the
old
slavery
to
bulky
and
nauseous
drugs
the
isolation
of
active
principles
long
antedated
the
synthetical
preparations
but
the
latter
came
at
last
the
marvellous
array
of
hypnotics
anodynes
and
that
are
now
at
our
command
largely
products
but
it
is
not
to
pure
chemistry
alone
that
we
are
indebted
for
the
elegant
dosing
of
the
present
day
progressive
pharmacy
with
its
tablets
its
coated
pills
and
its
capsules
has
put
to
shame
the
purveyor
of
galenicals
right
jauntily
do
we
now
take
our
soda
mint
in
case
of
slight
derangement
of
the
stomach
happily
oblivious
of
its
vile
prototype
the
old
rhubarb
and
soda
mixture
even
castor
oil
has
been
stripped
of
its
repulsiveness
by
the
combinations
which
the
soda
water
fountain
affords
it
was
but
a
step
we
can
now
realize
from
the
employment
of
isolated
vegetable
principles
to
that
of
preparations
of
certain
glandular
organs
of
the
animal
economy
but
the
doctrine
of
internal
secretions
had
to
intervene
and
its
evolution
took
time
not
till
toward
the
close
of
the
century
did
the
venerable
lead
up
to
it
we
have
not
yet
come
to
eye
of
newt
and
toe
of
frog
but
what
we
have
incorporated
into
modern
therapeutics
in
the
way
of
animal
products
lends
at
least
some
theoretical
justification
to
the
ancient
use
of
the
dried
organs
of
various
animals
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
the
ductless
glands
such
organs
as
for
example
the
thyreoid
gland
an
organ
situated
in
the
front
of
the
neck
a
small
affair
in
its
normal
state
but
prominent
and
even
pendulous
when
by
its
permanent
enlargement
it
comes
to
constitute
a
goître
were
looked
upon
as
puzzles
as
structures
destitute
of
any
known
function
some
observers
even
affirmed
that
they
had
no
function
though
the
constancy
of
goître
in
cretins
ought
to
have
shown
the
fallacy
of
this
allegation
in
the
case
of
the
thyreoid
we
do
not
now
need
to
be
told
that
the
thyreoid
gland
plays
a
very
important
part
in
the
economy
for
we
know
that
its
surgical
removal
gives
rise
to
a
special
disease
known
as
myxoedema
which
in
addition
to
its
physical
manifestations
is
characterized
by
impairment
of
the
mental
powers
consequently
this
ductless
gland
a
gland
that
is
to
say
which
has
no
obvious
canal
by
which
it
throws
off
any
product
of
its
activity
must
elaborate
some
material
that
is
necessary
to
the
health
of
the
organism
and
is
imparted
to
the
blood
that
material
whatever
it
may
be
is
termed
an
internal
secretion
some
of
the
internal
secretions
have
turned
out
to
be
of
singular
value
medicinally
it
is
apparently
not
the
ductless
glands
alone
that
furnish
internal
secretions
the
glands
that
are
provided
with
ducts
and
yield
a
definite
and
observable
product
secrete
also
a
substance
perhaps
more
than
one
which
they
give
up
to
the
blood
prominent
among
the
therapeutic
advances
of
the
century
is
the
direct
reduction
of
the
high
temperature
of
sunstroke
and
certain
fevers
by
the
use
of
cold
although
foreshadowed
by
currie
early
in
the
century
by
his
use
of
cold
affusion
in
the
treatment
of
scarlet
fever
it
did
not
come
into
general
use
until
the
closing
decades
it
is
employed
principally
in
typhoid
fever
on
the
theory
that
a
condition
of
high
fever
is
in
itself
a
source
of
danger
quite
distinct
from
the
other
injurious
effects
of
a
febrile
disease
on
the
other
hand
the
employment
of
high
degrees
of
heat
has
of
late
been
shown
to
be
a
potent
agency
in
the
treatment
of
certain
forms
of
disease
notably
in
various
affections
classed
as
rheumatic
applications
of
very
hot
air
provided
it
is
thoroughly
dry
are
borne
without
serious
discomfort
and
their
employment
promises
to
be
of
greater
service
in
the
conditions
in
which
it
is
resorted
to
than
that
of
any
other
agent
a
revelation
in
the
treatment
of
heart
disease
has
been
effected
by
the
bad
nauheim
system
of
effervescent
baths
and
resisted
exercises
it
is
not
only
functional
disorders
of
the
heart
that
are
relieved
but
grave
organic
diseases
also
somewhat
elaborate
explanations
of
the
way
in
which
the
treatment
proves
beneficial
have
been
given
but
they
are
not
altogether
satisfactory
thus
far
we
have
dealt
chiefly
with
those
developments
of
medicine
that
seem
to
have
been
the
outgrowth
of
much
thought
and
experiment
but
there
was
one
that
can
hardly
be
viewed
as
other
than
a
happy
discovery
yet
it
was
one
that
was
fraught
with
unspeakable
mitigation
of
human
suffering
and
that
wrought
a
boundless
extension
of
the
field
of
surgery
it
was
that
of
anaesthesia
the
first
to
discover
an
efficient
surgical
anaesthetic
was
crawford
long
of
georgia
it
has
been
established
that
he
performed
several
minor
operations
with
the
patient
anaesthetized
with
sulphuric
ether
but
he
did
not
proclaim
his
discovery
and
so
it
was
reserved
for
william
morton
of
boston
then
a
dentist
but
subsequently
a
physician
to
make
the
first
public
demonstration
of
the
efficiency
of
ether
as
an
anaesthetic
which
he
did
in
the
operating
theatre
of
the
massachusetts
general
hospital
in
boston
in
the
year
the
news
of
morton
achievement
spread
broadcast
and
it
was
at
once
realized
that
it
was
destined
to
revolutionize
surgery
it
certainly
has
done
that
and
in
no
less
degree
than
was
afterward
accomplished
by
listerism
ether
did
not
long
remain
the
only
anaesthetic
known
simpson
of
edinburgh
soon
discovered
that
chloroform
was
possessed
of
even
more
decided
anaesthetic
properties
the
inhalation
of
ether
is
disagreeable
and
it
is
slow
in
producing
the
desired
effect
whereas
that
of
chloroform
is
not
unpleasant
and
it
acts
more
rapidly
consequently
chloroform
soon
came
to
be
generally
preferred
but
abundant
experience
has
finally
shown
that
ether
is
much
the
safer
agent
of
the
two
and
improved
methods
of
administration
have
almost
entirely
done
away
with
the
objections
to
its
use
so
that
now
it
is
looked
upon
as
the
preferable
general
anaesthetic
but
general
anaesthesia
meaning
the
suspension
of
sensibility
in
the
whole
organism
including
unconsciousness
is
not
always
necessary
and
sometimes
it
is
undesirable
we
have
now
trustworthy
local
anaesthetics
the
chief
of
which
is
cocaine
wherewith
we
are
able
to
anaesthetize
the
part
to
be
operated
on
without
rendering
the
patient
unconscious
and
the
that
a
conscious
patient
may
be
able
to
render
is
sometimes
valuable
it
was
not
alone
in
the
direct
saving
of
human
suffering
that
anaesthetics
proved
a
boon
to
the
world
they
have
made
possible
an
amount
of
experimental
work
on
animals
in
the
way
of
vivisection
that
humane
investigators
would
otherwise
have
shrunk
from
necessary
as
it
has
been
and
still
is
for
the
advancement
of
the
healing
art
the
operation
of
ovariotomy
first
performed
by
ephraim
mcdowell
of
kentucky
can
hardly
be
classed
with
the
happy
accidents
but
so
little
had
been
said
about
it
or
thought
concerning
it
that
when
the
news
of
it
reached
europe
from
the
wilds
of
america
the
editor
of
a
ponderous
english
quarterly
journal
of
medicine
recorded
his
incredulity
in
the
words
judoeus
non
an
ovarian
tumor
inevitably
proves
fatal
in
the
long
run
if
it
is
not
removed
in
a
certain
percentage
of
cases
it
is
malignant
and
will
kill
whether
it
is
removed
or
not
but
the
general
result
of
ovariotomy
has
been
the
saving
of
thousands
of
women
from
untimely
death
bell
of
edinburgh
had
imagined
the
operation
and
had
mentioned
it
in
his
lectures
but
none
the
less
to
mcdowell
is
due
the
credit
of
demonstrating
its
feasibility
medicine
bore
quite
its
full
share
in
the
mitigation
of
the
horrors
and
hardships
of
war
that
marked
the
nineteenth
century
its
work
was
shown
in
the
great
reduction
of
pestilential
disease
incident
to
camp
life
in
prompt
aid
to
the
wounded
in
the
establishment
of
salubrious
field
and
general
hospitals
and
in
improved
methods
of
transportation
of
the
sick
and
wounded
certainly
the
soldier
on
the
sick
list
never
before
had
such
a
fair
prospect
of
rejoining
his
comrades
safe
and
sound
as
he
has
now
in
the
care
of
the
insane
too
care
not
only
in
the
sense
of
humane
treatment
but
in
the
systematic
employment
of
measures
for
their
restoration
to
mental
soundness
the
century
has
been
marked
by
notable
progress
this
has
been
chiefly
in
the
direction
of
preventing
insanity
and
although
mental
disease
is
said
to
be
on
the
increase
it
may
undoubtedly
be
said
with
entire
truth
that
its
growing
prevalence
is
not
in
proportion
to
the
heightened
frequency
of
the
strenuous
life
we
may
confidently
expect
that
a
more
pronounced
mastery
over
diseases
of
the
mind
will
come
when
physicians
in
general
are
taught
psychiatry
clinically
so
that
the
beginnings
of
mental
alienation
may
be
intelligently
met
by
the
family
practitioner
the
supreme
achievement
of
the
medicine
of
the
nineteenth
century
undoubtedly
has
been
the
development
of
its
preventive
feature
when
we
recall
the
fact
that
but
a
few
years
ago
an
attack
of
infectious
disease
was
interpreted
as
a
visitation
of
providence
by
a
perversity
that
even
the
triumphs
of
vaccination
did
not
serve
to
do
away
with
when
we
contemplate
the
and
measures
that
are
now
resorted
to
in
an
number
of
communities
and
resorted
to
not
solely
on
the
outbreak
of
an
epidemic
but
at
all
times
to
purify
the
air
we
breathe
the
food
we
eat
and
the
water
we
drink
and
when
we
reflect
upon
the
greatly
reduced
morbidity
as
well
as
mortality
of
most
infectious
diseases
we
must
realize
the
immense
service
that
has
been
rendered
by
preventive
medicine
no
doubt
we
must
all
die
some
time
and
the
day
is
yet
far
remote
when
the
only
causes
of
death
will
be
old
age
and
injury
but
a
decided
prolongation
of
the
average
lifetime
such
as
the
companies
recognize
is
an
unquestionable
gain
to
the
human
race
a
great
blessing
that
has
been
brought
about
in
great
measure
by
medical
men
has
been
the
establishment
of
the
profession
of
nursing
the
work
of
caring
for
the
sick
between
the
physician
visits
is
no
longer
at
least
in
large
communities
and
in
cases
of
severe
illness
left
to
and
uninstructed
relatives
or
to
outsiders
who
traded
on
mystery
an
intelligent
and
intelligible
record
is
now
kept
of
all
important
happenings
in
the
sick
room
remedies
are
administered
as
they
were
ordered
needless
alarm
at
something
deemed
by
the
patient
to
be
of
ill
omen
is
quelled
and
in
case
of
real
emergency
overlooked
as
it
might
otherwise
have
been
the
physician
is
summoned
to
meet
it
the
advent
of
the
trained
nurse
marked
an
era
in
medicine
the
literature
of
medicine
has
fully
kept
pace
in
volume
with
the
progress
of
the
art
itself
and
its
quality
has
steadily
improved
to
this
the
great
tomes
of
that
gigantic
work
the
of
the
library
of
the
office
united
states
army
bear
solid
testimony
it
is
a
consolidated
catalogue
by
subjects
and
by
authors
names
of
practically
every
medical
book
published
throughout
the
world
and
of
every
article
in
the
periodical
literature
of
medicine
for
its
existence
the
world
is
indebted
to
john
billings
formerly
a
surgeon
of
high
rank
in
the
army
and
now
the
director
of
the
new
york
public
library
and
for
its
continued
existence
to
the
united
states
government
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
congress
will
never
cease
to
provide
adequately
for
its
continued
publication
its
completeness
and
its
accuracy
long
ago
led
to
its
being
prized
everywhere
there
are
some
problems
of
which
medicine
has
hardly
yet
entered
upon
the
solution
prominent
among
them
is
that
of
cancer
little
as
we
now
know
of
the
real
nature
of
that
disease
we
know
quite
as
much
of
it
as
we
knew
but
a
few
years
ago
concerning
other
diseases
equally
destructive
and
far
more
prevalent
which
however
we
have
now
practically
mastered
who
can
say
that
we
shall
not
triumph
over
cancer
while
the
twentieth
century
is
still
young
our
final
triumph
is
indubitable
the
strongest
individuality
in
the
medicine
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
without
doubt
that
of
rudolf
ludwig
karl
virchow
commonly
written
by
him
simply
rudolf
virchow
although
he
took
no
direct
part
in
any
of
the
striking
advances
in
practice
that
appeal
to
the
laity
yet
he
was
recognized
the
world
over
among
all
classes
of
educated
and
persons
as
the
one
beacon
light
of
medicine
whose
glow
had
been
the
steadiest
and
the
most
enduring
this
is
because
of
the
wide
range
of
his
learning
in
matters
not
pertaining
closely
to
his
profession
his
professional
brethren
hold
the
same
view
and
this
is
because
he
so
well
controlled
himself
checked
himself
at
every
turn
by
the
severest
application
of
system
that
he
continued
for
more
than
half
a
century
an
anchor
to
hold
medical
thought
strictly
down
to
fact
this
was
from
no
natural
lack
of
volatility
for
he
was
an
in
as
a
prosector
in
the
university
of
berlin
virchow
entered
with
reinhardt
upon
a
series
of
pathological
investigations
which
at
once
received
wide
attention
in
conjunction
with
reinhardt
he
founded
the
für
pathologische
anatomie
und
physiologie
und
für
klinische
a
periodical
familiarly
called
virchow
the
publication
of
which
was
begun
in
the
year
reinhardt
died
in
leaving
the
editorship
in
the
hands
of
virchow
alone
and
he
was
still
its
editor
up
to
the
time
of
his
death
on
september
footnote
archives
of
pathological
anatomy
and
physiology
and
of
clinical
medicine
in
consequence
of
his
having
openly
proclaimed
himself
a
democrat
in
virchow
was
forced
to
retire
from
the
university
of
berlin
in
the
following
year
he
was
at
once
made
a
professor
in
the
university
of
würzburg
whence
seven
years
later
in
as
the
result
of
the
strenuous
interposition
of
various
medical
organizations
he
was
recalled
to
berlin
where
he
was
made
a
professor
and
director
of
the
pathological
institute
he
was
appointed
medical
privy
councillor
in
having
several
years
before
that
entered
upon
an
active
political
career
and
been
one
of
the
founders
of
the
progressive
party
which
he
ably
represented
in
the
landtag
and
the
reichstag
in
he
took
part
in
founding
the
german
and
the
berlin
anthropological
societies
of
each
of
which
he
was
several
times
president
virchow
investigated
the
most
diverse
subjects
as
his
profound
studies
of
schliemann
discoveries
as
well
as
his
other
archaeological
researches
show
and
he
was
a
rather
prolific
writer
the
most
important
of
his
early
works
was
the
first
edition
of
which
was
published
in
chance
english
translation
appeared
in
and
picard
french
version
came
out
in
it
is
safe
to
say
that
no
book
of
the
century
exerted
a
profounder
influence
on
medical
thought
than
virchow
exposition
of
the
cellular
pathology
his
next
notable
publication
was
a
collection
of
thirty
lectures
on
tumors
krankhaften
berlin
that
he
was
not
too
absorbed
in
these
lectures
to
bring
his
great
powers
to
bear
upon
topics
of
the
day
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
before
their
publication
was
completed
he
brought
out
his
work
on
trichinae
der
lehre
von
den
old
age
found
him
with
industry
and
versatility
unabated
for
it
was
in
that
his
ethnica
appeared
and
after
that
time
he
wrote
a
vigorous
protest
against
the
spelling
of
the
german
language
which
he
accused
the
schoolmasters
of
trying
to
foist
on
the
people
this
was
published
in
his
it
may
well
be
that
his
arguments
have
not
been
unavailing
since
it
is
observable
that
several
german
publications
that
had
adopted
the
new
spelling
have
now
dropped
it
footnote
morbid
tumors
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
it
was
by
his
literary
work
alone
founded
though
it
was
manifestly
on
his
profound
study
that
virchow
impressed
his
personality
upon
medicine
it
was
in
his
lectures
and
in
his
laboratory
teaching
too
that
he
made
himself
felt
in
all
civilized
countries
there
are
many
devoted
workers
in
medical
science
who
caught
their
first
real
inspiration
from
virchow
the
writer
once
saw
virchow
only
once
but
it
was
a
sight
never
to
be
forgotten
it
was
at
a
banquet
given
as
one
of
the
festivities
incident
to
the
annual
meeting
of
the
british
medical
association
in
london
in
the
company
was
not
a
large
one
but
it
included
such
celebrities
as
professor
burdon
sanderson
sir
william

professor
chauveau
and
professor
marey
virchow
was
conspicuously
the
man
toward
whom
the
eyes
of
all
others
were
oftenest
directed
virchow
met
with
the
love
as
well
as
the
admiration
of
his
contemporaries
and
both
sentiments
will
descend
to
their
successors
for
his
impress
on
the
records
of
medicine
is
indelible
both
as
an
instructor
and
as
a
friend

all
real
authorities
