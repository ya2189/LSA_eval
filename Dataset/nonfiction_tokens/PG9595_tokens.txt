abolition
there
is
a
law
above
all
the
enactments
of
human
codes
the
same
throughout
the
world
the
same
in
all
time
such
as
it
was
before
the
daring
genius
of
columbus
pierced
the
night
of
ages
and
opened
to
one
world
the
sources
of
wealth
and
power
and
knowledge
to
another
all
unutterable
woes
such
as
it
is
at
this
day
it
is
the
law
written
by
the
finger
of
god
upon
the
heart
of
man
and
by
that
law
unchangeable
and
eternal
while
men
despise
fraud
and
loathe
rapine
and
abhor
blood
they
shall
reject
with
indignation
the
wild
and
guilty
fantasy
that
man
can
hold
property
in
man
lord
brougham
it
may
be
inquired
of
me
why
i
seek
to
agitate
the
subject
of
slavery
in
new
england
where
we
all
acknowledge
it
to
be
an
evil
because
such
an
acknowledgment
is
not
enough
on
our
part
it
is
doing
no
more
than
the
and
the
we
have
found
says
james
monroe
in
his
speech
on
the
subject
before
the
virginia
convention
that
this
evil
has
preyed
upon
the
very
vitals
of
the
union
and
has
been
prejudicial
to
all
the
states
in
which
it
has
existed
all
the
states
in
their
several
constitutions
and
declarations
of
rights
have
made
a
similar
statement
and
what
has
been
the
consequence
of
this
general
belief
in
the
evil
of
human
servitude
has
it
sapped
the
foundations
of
the
infamous
system
no
has
it
decreased
the
number
of
its
victims
quite
the
contrary
unaccompanied
by
philanthropic
action
it
has
been
in
a
moral
point
of
view
worthless
a
thing
without
vitality
sightless
soulless
dead
but
it
may
be
said
that
the
miserable
victims
of
the
system
have
our
sympathies
sympathy
the
sympathy
of
the
priest
and
the
levite
looking
on
and
acknowledging
but
holding
itself
aloof
from
mortal
suffering
can
such
hollow
sympathy
reach
the
broken
of
heart
and
does
the
blessing
of
those
who
are
ready
to
perish
answer
it
does
it
hold
back
the
lash
from
the
slave
or
sweeten
his
bitter
bread
one
heart
and
soul
are
becoming
weary
of
this
sympathy
this
heartless
mockery
of
feeling
sick
of
the
common
cant
of
hypocrisy
wreathing
the
artificial
flowers
of
sentiment
over
unutterable
pollution
and
unimaginable
wrong
it
is
the
sepulchre
to
make
us
forget
its
horrible
deposit
it
is
scattering
flowers
around
the
and
over
the
yet
festering
grave
to
turn
away
our
thoughts
from
the
dead
men
bones
and
all
uncleanness
the
pollution
and
loathsomeness
below
no
let
the
truth
on
this
subject
undisguised
naked
terrible
as
it
is
stand
out
before
us
let
us
no
longer
seek
to
cover
it
let
us
no
longer
strive
to
forget
it
let
us
no
more
dare
to
palliate
it
it
is
better
to
meet
it
here
with
repentance
than
at
the
bar
of
god
the
cry
of
the
oppressed
of
the
millions
who
have
perished
among
us
as
the
brute
perisheth
shut
out
from
the
glad
tidings
of
salvation
has
gone
there
before
us
to
him
who
as
a
father
pitieth
all
his
children
their
blood
is
upon
us
as
a
nation
woe
unto
us
if
we
repent
not
as
a
nation
in
dust
and
ashes
woe
unto
us
if
we
say
in
our
hearts
the
lord
shall
not
see
neither
shall
the
god
of
jacob
regard
it
he
that
planted
the
ear
shall
he
not
hear
he
who
formed
the
eye
shall
he
not
see
but
it
may
be
urged
that
new
england
has
no
participation
in
slavery
and
is
not
responsible
for
its
wickedness
why
are
we
thus
willing
to
believe
a
lie
new
england
not
responsible
bound
by
the
united
states
constitution
to
protect
the
in
his
sins
and
yet
not
responsible
joining
hands
with
crime
covenanting
with
oppression
leaguing
with
pollution
and
yet
not
responsible
palliating
the
evil
hiding
the
evil
voting
for
the
evil
do
we
not
participate

in

of

for
inquiring
into
the
expediency
of
abolishing
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
members
of
one
confederacy
children
of
one
family
the
curse
and
the
shame
the
sin
against
our
brother
and
the
sin
against
our
god
all
the
iniquity
of
slavery
which
is
revealed
to
man
and
all
which
crieth
in
the
ear
or
is
manifested
to
the
eye
of
jehovah
will
assuredly
be
visited
upon
all
our
people
why
then
should
we
stretch
out
our
hands
towards
our
southern
brethren
and
like
the
pharisee
thank
god
we
are
not
like
them
for
so
long
as
we
practically
recognize
the
infernal
principle
that
man
can
hold
property
in
man
god
will
not
hold
us
guiltless
so
long
as
we
take
counsel
of
the
world
policy
instead
of
the
justice
of
heaven
so
long
as
we
follow
a
mistaken
political
expediency
in
opposition
to
the
express
commands
of
god
so
long
will
the
wrongs
of
the
slaves
rise
like
a
cloud
of
witnesses
against
us
at
the
inevitable
bar
slavery
is
protected
by
the
constitutional
compact
by
the
standing
army
by
the
militia
of
the
free
states
adams
is
the
only
member
of
congress
who
has
ventured
to
speak
plainly
of
this
protection
see
also
his
very
able
report
from
the
minority
of
the
committee
on
manufactures
in
his
speech
during
the
last
session
upon
the
bill
of
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
after
discussing
the
constitutional
protection
of
slavery
he
says
but
that
same
interest
is
further
protected
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states
it
was
protected
by
the
existence
of
a
standing
army
if
the
states
of
this
union
were
all
free
republican
states
and
none
of
them
possessed
any
of
the
machinery
of
which
he
had
spoken
and
if
another
portion
of
the
union
were
not
exposed
to
another
danger
from
their
vicinity
to
the
tribes
of
indian
savages
he
believed
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
to
the
house
any
such
thing
as
the
necessity
of
a
standing
army
what
in
fact
was
the
occupation
of
the
army
it
had
been
protecting
this
very
same
interest
it
had
been
doing
so
ever
since
the
army
existed
of
what
use
to
the
district
of
plymouth
which
he
there
represented
was
the
standing
army
of
the
united
states
of
not
one
use
and
never
had
been
let
us
not
forget
that
should
the
slaves
goaded
by
wrongs
unendurable
rise
in
desperation
and
pour
the
torrent
of
their
brutal
revenge
over
the
beautiful
carolinas
or
the
consecrated
soil
of
virginia
new
england
would
be
called
upon
to
arrest
the
progress
of
rebellion
to
tread
out
with
the
armed
heel
of
her
soldiery
that
spirit
of
freedom
which
knows
no
distinction
of
cast
or
color
which
has
been
kindled
in
the
heart
of
the
black
as
well
as
in
that
of
the
white
and
what
is
this
system
which
we
are
thus
protecting
and
upholding
a
system
which
holds
two
millions
of
god
creatures
in
bondage
which
leaves
one
million
females
without
any
protection
save
their
own
feeble
strength
and
which
makes
even
the
exercise
of
that
strength
in
resistance
to
outrage
punishable
with
death
which
considers
rational
immortal
beings
as
articles
of
traffic
vendible
commodities
merchantable
property
which
recognizes
no
social
obligations
no
natural
relations
which
tears
without
scruple
the
infant
from
the
mother
the
wife
from
the
husband
the
parent
from
the
child
in
the
strong
but
just
language
of
another
it
is
the
full
measure
of
pure
unmixed
unsophisticated
wickedness
and
scorning
all
competition
or
comparison
it
stands
without
a
rival
in
the
secure
undisputed
possession
of
its
detestable
preeminence
so
fearful
an
evil
should
have
its
remedies
the
following
are
among
the
many
which
have
been
from
time
to
time
proposed
placing
the
slaves
in
the
condition
of
the
serfs
of
poland
and
russia
fixed
to
the
soil
and
without
the
right
on
the
part
of
the
master
to
sell
or
remove
them
this
was
intended
as
a
preliminary
to
complete
emancipation
at
some
remote
period
but
it
is
impossible
to
perceive
either
its
justice
or
expediency
gradual
abolition
an
indefinite
term
but
which
is
understood
to
imply
the
draining
away
drop
by
drop
of
the
great
ocean
of
wrong
plucking
off
at
long
intervals
some
straggling
branches
of
the
moral
upas
holding
out
to
unborn
generations
the
shadow
of
a
hope
which
the
present
may
never
feel
gradually
ceasing
to
do
evil
gradually
refraining
from
robbery
lust
and
murder
in
brief
obeying
a
and
criminal
policy
rather
than
the
commands
of
god
abstinence
on
the
part
of
the
people
of
the
free
states
from
the
use
of
the
known
products
of
slave
labor
in
order
to
render
that
labor
profitless
beyond
a
doubt
the
example
of
conscientious
individuals
may
have
a
salutary
effect
upon
the
minds
of
some
of
the
i
but
so
long
as
our
confederacy
exists
a
commercial
intercourse
with
slave
states
and
a
consumption
of
their
products
can
not
be
avoided
the
following
is
a
recorded
statement
of
the
venerated
sir
william
jones
let
sugar
be
as
cheap
as
it
may
it
is
better
to
eat
none
better
to
eat
aloes
and
colloquintida
than
violate
a
primary
law
impressed
on
every
heart
not
imbruted
with
avarice
than
rob
one
human
creature
of
those
eternal
rights
of
which
no
law
on
earth
can
justly
deprive
him
colonization
the
exclusive
object
of
the
american
colonization
society
according
to
the
second
article
of
its
constitution
is
to
colonize
the
free
people
of
color
residing
among
us
in
africa
or
such
other
place
as
congress
may
direct
steadily
adhering
to
this
object
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
slavery
and
i
allude
to
it
as
a
remedy
only
because
some
of
its
friends
have
in
view
an
eventual
abolition
or
an
amelioration
of
the
evil
let
facts
speak
the
colonization
society
was
organized
in
it
has
two
hundred
and
eighteen
auxiliary
societies
the
legislatures
of
fourteen
states
have
recommended
it
contributions
have
poured
into
its
treasury
from
every
quarter
of
the
united
states
addresses
in
its
favor
have
been
heard
from
all
our
pulpits
it
has
been
in
operation
sixteen
years
during
this
period
nearly
one
million
human
beings
have
died
in
slavery
and
the
number
of
slaves
has
increased
more
than
half
a
million
or
in
round
numbers
the
colonization
society
has
been
busily
engaged
all
this
while
in
conveying
the
slaves
to
africa
in
other
words
abolishing
slavery
in
this
very
charitable
occupation
it
has
carried
away
of
manumitted
slaves
balance
against
the
society
but
enough
of
its
abolition
tendency
what
has
it
done
for
amelioration
witness
the
newly
enacted
laws
of
some
of
the
slave
states
laws
bloody
as
the
code
of
draco
violating
the
laws
of
cod
and
the
unalienable
rights
of
his
children
it
will
be
seen
that
the
society
approves
of
these
laws
but
why
talk
of
amelioration
amelioration
of
what
of
sin
of
crime
unutterable
of
a
system
of
wrong
and
outrage
horrible
in
the
eye
of
god
why
seek
to
mark
the
line
of
a
selfish
policy
a
carnal
expediency
between
the
criminality
of
hell
and
that
repentance
and
its
fruits
enjoined
of
heaven
for
the
principles
and
views
of
the
society
we
must
look
to
its
own
statements
and
admissions
to
its
annual
reports
to
those
of
its
auxiliaries
to
the
speeches
and
writings
of
its
advocates
and
to
its
organ
the
african
repository
it
excuses
slavery
and
apologizes
for
slaveholders
proof
slavery
is
an
evil
entailed
upon
the
present
generation
of
which
they
must
suffer
whether
they
will
or
not
the
existence
of
slavery
among
us
though
not
at
all
to
be
objected
to
our
southern
brethren
as
a
fault
etc
it
the
society
condemns
no
man
because
he
is
a
recognizing
the
constitutional
and
legitimate
existence
of
slavery
it
seeks
not
to
interfere
either
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
rights
it
creates
acknowledging
the
necessity
by
which
its
present
continuance
and
the
rigorous
provisions
for
its
maintenance
are
justified
etc
they
the
abolitionists
confound
the
misfortunes
of
one
generation
with
the
crimes
of
another
and
would
sacrifice
both
individual
and
public
good
to
an
unsubstantial
theory
of
the
rights
of
man
it
pledges
itself
not
to
oppose
the
system
of
slavery
proof
our
society
and
the
friends
of
colonization
wish
to
be
distinctly
understood
upon
this
point
from
the
beginning
they
have
disavowed
and
they
do
yet
disavow
that
their
object
is
the
emancipation
of
slaves
speech
of
james
green
first
annual
report
of
the
new
jersey
colonization
society
this
institution
proposes
to
do
good
by
a
single
specific
course
of
measures
its
direct
and
specific
purpose
is
not
the
abolition
of
slavery
or
the
relief
of
pauperism
or
the
extension
of
commerce
and
civilization
or
the
enlargement
of
science
or
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
the
single
object
which
its
constitution
prescribes
and
to
which
all
its
efforts
are
necessarily
directed
is
african
colonization
from
america
it
proposes
only
to
afford
facilities
for
the
voluntary
emigration
of
free
people
of
color
from
this
country
to
the
country
of
their
fathers
it
is
no
abolition
society
it
addresses
as
yet
arguments
to
no
master
and
disavows
with
horror
the
idea
of
offering
temptations
to
any
slave
it
denies
the
design
of
attempting
emancipation
either
partial
or
general
the
colonization
society
as
such
have
renounced
wholly
the
name
and
the
characteristics
of
abolitionists
on
this
point
they
have
been
unjustly
and
injuriously
slandered
into
their
accounts
the
subject
of
emancipation
does
not
enter
at
all
from
its
origin
and
throughout
the
whole
period
of
its
existence
it
has
constantly
disclaimed
all
intention
of
interfering
in
the
smallest
degree
with
the
rights
of
property
or
the
object
of
emancipation
gradual
or
the
society
presents
to
the
american
public
no
project
of

the
emancipation

the
amelioration
of
their
condition
with
the
moral
intellectual
and
political
improvement
of
people
of
color
within
the
united

are
subjects
foreign
to
the
powers
of
this
society
the
society
as
a
society
recognizes
no
principles
in
reference
to
the
slave
system
it
says
nothing
and
proposes
to
do
nothing
respecting
so
far
as
we
can
ascertain
the
supporters
of
the
colonization
policy
generally
believe
that
slavery
is
in
this
country
a
constitptional
and
legitimate
system
which
they
have
no
inclination
interest
nor
ability
to
disturb
it
regards
god
rational
creatures
as
property
proof
we
hold
their
slaves
as
we
hold
their
other
property
sacred
it
is
equally
plain
and
undeniable
that
the
society
in
the
prosecution
of
this
work
has
never
interfered
or
evinced
even
a
disposition
to
interfere
in
any
way
with
the
rights
of
proprietors
of
slaves

the
who
has

this

result

during

the

ordered
the

of
the
fact
that
the
pirates
engaged
in
the
african

supplied
from
the
stores
of

and

with
such
articles
as
the
infernal
traffic
demands
an
able
english
writer
on
the
subject
of

thus
notices
this
astounding
fact
and
here
it
may
be
well
to
observe
that
as
long
as
negro
slavery
lasts
all
colonies
on
the
african
coast
of
whatever
description
must
tend
to
support
it
because
in
all
commerce
the
supply
is
more
or
less
proportioned
to
the
demand
the
demand
exists
in
negro
slavery
the
supply
arises
from
the
african
and
what
greater
convenience
could
the
african
desire
than
shops
well
stored
along
the
coast
with
the
very
articles
which
their
trade
demands
that
the
african
do
get
thus
supplied
at
sierra
leone
and
liberia
is
matter
of
official
evidence
and
we
know
from
the
nature
of
human
things
that
they
will
get
so
supplied
in
defiance
of
all
law
or
precaution
as
long
as
the
demand
calls
for
the
supply
and
there
are
free
shops
stored
with
all
they
want
at
hand
the
shopkeeper
however
honest
would
find
it
impossible
always
to
distinguish
between
the
african
or
his
agents
and
other
dealers
and
how
many
shopkeepers
are
there
anywhere
that
would
be
over
scrupulous
in
questioning
a
customer
with
a
full
purse

are
told
that
the

civilize

that
it

neither

that

no

but
on
the
contrary
that
it
is
a
safe
practicable
efficient
remedy
for
the
evils
of
the

the
term
immediate
is

with
that

as
i
wish

no

they
ask
no

can
not
hold

in
his

that
the

of
this

will
utterly
destroy
the

to
make
use
of
the
clear
exposition

our

is
simply
this
to
promulgate
the
true
doctrine
of
human
rights
in
high
places

low

and
all
places
where
there
are
human
beings

whisper
it
in

to
proclaim
it
from

from

pour
it
out

the

could
point
with

what
then
is
our

elsewhere
that
our

i
may
be
regarded
as
a
fanatic
for
quoting
the
language
of
eternal
truth
and
denounced
as
an
incendiary
for
maintaining
in
the
spirit
as
well
as
the
letter
the
doctrines
of
american
independence
but
if
such
are
the
consequences
of
a
simple
performance
of
duty
i
shall
not

them
if
my
feeble
appeal
but
reaches
the
hearts
of
any
who
are
now
slumbering
in
iniquity
if
it
shall
have
power
given
it
to
shake
down
one
stone
from
that
foul
temple
where
the
blood
of
human
victims
is
offered
to
the
moloch
of
slavery
if
under
providence
it
can
break
one
fetter
from
off
the
image
of

and
enable
one
suffering
african
to
feel
the
weight
of
human
misery
less
and
glide
ungroaning
to
the
tomb
i
shall
not
have
written
in

my
conscience
will
be
satisfied
far
be
it
from
me
to
cast
new
bitterness
into
the
gall
and
wormwood
waters
of
sectional

no
i
desire
peace
the
peace
of
universal
love
of
catholic
sympathy
the
peace
of
a
common
interest
a
common
feeling
a
common
humanity
but
so
long
as
slavery
is
tolerated
no
such
peace
can
exist
liberty
and
slavery
can
not
dwell
in
harmony
together
there
will
be
a
perpetual
war
in
the
members
of
the
political
mezentius
between
the
living
and
the
dead
god
and
man
have
placed
between
them
an
everlasting
barrier
an
eternal
separation
no
matter
under
what
name
or
law
or
compact
their
union
is
attempted
the
ordination
of
providence
has
forbidden
it
and
it
can
not
stand
peace
there
can
be
no
peace
between
justice
and
oppression
between
robbery
and
righteousness
truth
and
falsehood
freedom
and
slavery
the
states
are
not
free
the
name
of
liberty
is
there
but
the
spirit
is
wanting
they
do
not
partake
of
its
invaluable
blessings
wherever
slavery
exists
to
any
considerable
extent
with
the
exception
of
some
recently
settled
portions
of
the
country
and
which
have
not
yet
felt
in
a
great
degree
the
baneful
and
deteriorating
influences
of
slave
labor
we
hear
at
this
moment
the
cry
of
suffering
we
are
told
of
streets
of
crumbling
mansions
of
beggared
planters
and
barren
plantations
of
fear
from
without
of
terror
within
the
once
fertile
fields

wasted
and
tenantless
for
the
curse
of
slavery
the
improvidence
of
that
labor
whose

been
kept
back
by
fraud
has
been
there
poisoning

his
displeasure
let
then
the

consult
their

without

fear
not

at

the

the

historical

the
nature
of
the
human
mind
the
demonstrated
truths
of
political
economy
the
analysis
of
cause
and
effect
all
concur
in
establishing
that
immediate
abolition
is
a
safe
and
just
and
peaceful
remedy
for
the
evils
of
the
slave
system
that
free
labor
its
necessary
consequence
is
more
productive
and
more
advantageous
to
the
planter
than
slave
labor
in
proof
of
the
first
proposition
it
is
only
necessary
to
state
the
undeniable
fact
that
immediate
emancipation
whether
by
an
individual
or
a
community
has
in
no
instance
been
attended
with
violence
and
disorder
on
the
part
of
the
emancipated
but
that
on
the
contrary
it
has
promoted
cheerfulness
industry
and
laudable
ambition
in
the
place
of
sullen
discontent
indolence
and
despair
the
case
of
domingo
is
in
point
blood
was
indeed
shed
on
that
island
like
water
but
it
was
not
in
consequence
of
emancipation
it
was
shed
in
the
civil
war
which
preceded
it
and
in
the
iniquitous
attempt
to
restore
the
slave
system
in
it
flowed
on
the
sanguine
altar
of
slavery
not
on
the
pure
and
peaceful
one
of
emancipation
no
there
as
in
all
the
world
and
in
all
time
the
violence
of
oppression
engendered
violence
on
the
part
of
the
oppressed
and
vengeance
followed
only
upon
the
iron
footsteps
of
wrong
when
where
did
justice
to
the
injured
waken
their
hate
and
vengeance
when
where
did
love
and
kindness
and
sympathy
irritate
and
madden
the
persecuted
the
the
foully
wronged
in
september
the
commissioner
of
the
french
national
convention
issued
his
proclamation
giving
immediate
freedom
to
all
the
slaves
of
domingo
did
the
slaves
baptize
their
freedom
in
blood
did
they
fight
like
unchained
desperadoes
because
they
had
been
made
free
did
they
murder
their
emancipators
no
they
acted
as
human
beings
must
act
under
similar
circumstances
by
a
law
as
irresistible
as
those
of
the
universe
kindness
disarmed
them
justice
conciliated
them
freedom
ennobled
them
no
tumult
followed
this
wide
and
instantaneous
emancipation
it
cost
not
one
drop
of
blood
it
abated
not
one
tittle
of
the
wealth
or
the
industry
of
the
island
colonel
malenfant
a
slave
proprietor
residing
at
the
time
on
the
island
states
that
after
the
public
act
of
abolition
the
negroes
remained
perfectly
quiet
they
had
obtained
all
they
asked
for
liberty
and
they
continued
to
work
upon
all
the
malenfant
in
memoirs
for
a
history
of
domingo
by
general
lecroix
there
were
estates
he
says
which
had
neither
owners
nor
managers
resident
upon
them
yet
upon
these
estates
though
abandoned
the
negroes
continued
their
labors
where
there
were
any
even
inferior
agents
to
guide
them
and
on
those
estates
where
no
white
men
were
left
to
direct
them
they
betook
themselves
to
the
planting
of
provisions
but
upon
all
the
plantations
where
the
whites
resided
the
blacks
continued
to
labor
as
quietly
as
before
colonel
malenfant
says
that
when
many
of
his
neighbors
proprietors
or
managers
were
in
prison
the
negroes
of
their
plantations
came
to
him
to
beg
him
to
direct
them
in
their
work
if
you
will
take
care
not
to
talk
to
them
of
the
restoration
of
slavery
but
talk
to
them
of
freedom
you
may
with
this
word
chain
them
down
to
their
labor
how
did
toussaint
succeed
how
did
i
succeed
before
his
time
in
the
plain
of
the
on
the
plantation
of
gouraud
during
more
than
eight
months
after
liberty
had
been
granted
to
the
slaves
let
those
who
knew
me
at
that
time
let
the
blacks
themselves
be
asked
they
will
all
reply
that
not
a
single
negro
upon
that
plantation
consisting
of
more
than
four
hundred
and
fifty
laborers
refused
to
work
and
yet
this
plantation
was
thought
to
be
under
the
worst
discipline
and
the
slaves
the
most
idle
of
any
in
the
plain
i
inspired
the
same
activity
into
three
other
plantations
of
which
i
had
the
management
if
all
the
negroes
had
come
from
africa
within
six
months
if
they
had
the
love
of
independence
that
the
indians
have
i
should
own
that
force
must
be
employed
but
out
of
a
hundred
of
the
blacks
are
aware
that
without
labor
they
can
not
procure
the
things
that
are
necessary
for
them
that
there
is
no
other
method
of
satisfying
their
wants
and
their
tastes
they
know
that
they
must
work
they
wish
to
do
so
and
they
will
do
so
this
is
strong
testimony
in
three
years
after
the
act
of
emancipation
we
are
told
that
the
colony
was
flourishing
under
toussaint
that
the
whites
lived
happily
and
peaceably
on
their
estates
and
the
blacks
continued
to
work
for
them
up
to
the
same
happy
state
of
things
continued
the
colony
went
on
as
by
enchantment
cultivation
made
day
by
day
a
perceptible
progress
under
the
recuperative
energies
of
free
labor
in
general
vincent
a
proprietor
of
estates
in
the
island
was
sent
by
toussaint
to
paris
for
the
purpose
of
laying
before
the
directory
the
new
constitution
which
had
been
adopted
at
domingo
he
reached
france
just
after
the
peace
of
amiens
when
napoleon
was
fitting
out
his
armament
for
the
insane
purpose
of
restoring
slavery
in
the
island
general
vincent
remonstrated
solemnly
and
earnestly
against
an
expedition
so
preposterous
so
cruel
and
unnecessary
undertaken
at
a
moment
when
all
was
peace
and
quietness
in
the
colony
when
the
proprietors
were
in
peaceful
possession
of
their
estates
when
cultivation
was
making
a
rapid
progress
and
the
blacks
were
industrious
and
happy
beyond
example
he
begged
that
this
beautiful
state
of
things
might
not
be
reversed
the
remonstrance
was
not
regarded
and
the
expedition
proceeded
its
issue
is
well
known
threatened
once
more
with
the
horrors
of
slavery
the
peaceful
and
quiet
laborer
became
transformed
into
a
demon
of
ferocity
the
and
the
hook
gave
way
to
the
pike
and
the
dagger
the
white
invaders
were
driven
back
by
the
sword
and
the
pestilence
and
then
and
not
till
then
was
the
property
of
the
planters
seized
upon
by
the
excited
and
infuriated
blacks
in
dessalines
was
proclaimed
emperor
of
hayti
the
black
troops
were
in
a
great
measure
disbanded
and
they
immediately
returned
to
the
cultivation
of
the
plantations
from
that
period
up
to
the
present
there
has
been
no
want
of
industry
among
the
inhabitants
harvey
who
during
the
reign
of
christophe
resided
at
cape
francois
in
describing
the
character
and
condition
of
the
inhabitants
says
it
was
an
interesting
sight
to
behold
this
class
of
the
haytiens
now
in
possession
of
their
freedom
coming
in
groups
to
the
market
nearest
which
they
resided
bringing
the
produce
of
their
industry
there
for
sale
and
afterwards
returning
carrying
back
the
necessary
articles
of
living
which
the
disposal
of
their
commodities
had
enabled
them
to
purchase
all
evidently
cheerful
and
happy
nor
could
it
fail
to
occur
to
the
mind
that
their
present
condition
furnished
the
most
satisfactory
answer
to
that
objection
to
the
general
emancipation
of
slaves
founded
on
their
alleged
unfitness
to
value
and
improve
the
benefits
of
as
they
would
not
suffer
so
they
do
not
require
the
attendance
of
one
acting
in
the
capacity
of
a
driver
with
the
instrument
of
punishment
in
his
hand
as
far
as
i
had
an
opportunity
of
ascertaining
from
what
fell
under
my
own
observation
and
from
what
i
gathered
from
other
european
residents
i
am
persuaded
of
one
general
fact
which
on
account
of
its
importance
i
shall
state
in
the
most
explicit
terms
namely
that
the
haytiens
employed
in
cultivating
the
plantations
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
population
perform
as
much
work
in
a
given
time
as
they
were
accustomed
to
do
during
their
subjection
to
the
french
and
if
we
may
judge
of
their
future
improvement
by
the
change
which
has
been
already
effected
it
may
be
reasonably
anticipated
that
hayti
will
erelong
contain
a
population
not
inferior
in
their
industry
to
that
of
any
civilized
nation
in
the
every
man
had
some
calling
to
occupy
his
attention
instances
of
idleness
or
intemperance
were
of
rare
occurrence
the
most
perfect
subordination
prevailed
and
all
appeared
contented
and
happy
a
foreigner
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
persuade
himself
on
his
first
entering
the
place
that
the
people
he
now
beheld
so
submissive
industrious
and
contented
were
the
same
people
who
a
few
years
before
had
escaped
from
the
shackles
of
slavery
the
present
condition
of
hayti
may
be
judged
of
from
the
following
authenticated
facts
its
population
is
more
than
its
resources
ample
its
prosperity
and
happiness
general
its
crimes
few
its
labor
crowned
with
abundance
with
no
paupers
save
the
decrepit
and
aged
its
people
hospitable
respectful
orderly
and
contented
the
manumitted
slaves
who
to
the
number
of
two
thousand
were
settled
in
nova
scotia
by
the
british
government
at
the
close
of
the
revolutionary
war
led
a
harmless
life
and
gained
the
character
of
an
honest
industrious
people
from
their
white
neighbors
of
the
free
laborers
of
trinidad
we
have
the
same
report
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
three
thousand
negroes
received
their
freedom
and
with
scarce
a
single
exception
betook
themselves
to
laborious
employments
but
we
have
yet
stronger
evidence
the
total
abolishment
of
slavery
in
the
southern
republics
has
proved
beyond
dispute
the
safety
and
utility
of
immediate
abolition
the
departed
bolivar
indeed
deserves
his
glorious
title
of
liberator
for
he
began
his
career
of
freedom
by
striking
off
the
fetters
of
his
own
slaves
seven
hundred
in
number
in
an
official
letter
from
the
mexican
envoy
of
the
british
government
dated
mexico
march
and
addressed
the
right
hon
george
canning
the
superiority
of
free
over
slave
labor
is
clearly
demonstrated
by
the
following
facts
it
is
now
carried
on
exclusively
by
the
labor
of
free
blacks
it
was
formerly
wholly
sustained
by
the
forced
labor
of
slaves
purchased
at
vera
cruz
at
to
each
abolition
in
this
section
was
effected
not
by
governmental
interference
not
even
from
motives
of
humanity
but
from
an
irresistible
conviction
on
the
part
of
the
planters
that
their
pecuniary
interest
demanded
it
the
result
has
proved
the
entire
correctness
of
this
conviction
and
the
planters
would
now
be
as
unwilling
as
the
blacks
themselves
to
return
to
the
old
system
let
our
southern
brethren
imitate
this
example
it
is
in
vain
in
the
face
of
facts
like
these
to
talk
of
the
necessity
of
maintaining
the
abominable
system
operating
as
it
does
like
a
double
curse
upon
planters
and
slaves
heaven
and
earth
deny
its
necessity
it
is
as
necessary
as
other
robberies
and
no
more
yes
putting
aside
altogether
the
righteous
law
of
the
living
god
the
same
yesterday
and
forever
and
shutting
out
the
clearest
political
truths
ever
taught
by
man
still
in
human
policy
selfish
expediency
would
demand
of
the
planter
the
immediate
emancipation
of
his
slaves
because
slave
labor
is
the
labor
of
mere
machines
a
mechanical
impulse
of
body
and
limb
with
which
the
mind
of
the
laborer
has
no
sympathy
and
from
which
it
constantly
and
loathingly
revolts
because
slave
labor
deprives
the
master
altogether
of
the
incalculable
benefit
of
the
negro
will
that
does
not
cooperate
with
the
forced
toil
of
the
body
this
is
but
the
necessary
consequence
of
all
labor
which
does
not
benefit
the
laborer
it
is
a
just
remark
of
that
profound
political
economist
adam
smith
that
a
slave
can
have
no
other
interest
than
to
eat
and
waste
as
much
and
work
as
little
as
he
can
to
my
mind
in
the
wasteful
and
blighting
influences
of
slave
labor
there
is
a
solemn
and
warning
moral
they
seem
the
evidence
of
the
displeasure
of
him
who
created
man
after
his
own
image
at
the
unnatural
attempt
to
govern
the
bones
and
sinews
the
bodies
and
souls
of
one
portion
of
his
children
by
the
caprice
the
avarice
the
lusts
of
another
at
that
utter
violation
of
the
design
of
his
merciful
providence
whereby
the
entire
dependence
of
millions
of
his
rational
creatures
is
made
to
centre
upon
the
will
the
existence
the
ability
of
their
instead
of
resting
under
the
shadow
of
his
own
infinite
power
and
exceeding
love
i
shall
offer
a
few
more
facts
and
observations
on
this
point
a
distinguished
scientific
gentleman
coulomb
the
superintendent
of
several
military
works
in
the
french
west
indies
gives
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
slaves
do
not
perform
more
than
one
third
of
the
labor
which
they
would
do
provided
they
were
urged
by
their
own
interests
and
inclinations
instead
of
brute
force
a
plantation
in
barbadoes
in
was
cultivated
by
two
hundred
and
slaves
ninety
men
women
boys
and
sixty
girls
in
three
years
and
three
months
there
were
on
this
plantation
deaths
and
only
fifteen
births
a
change
was
then
made
in
the
government
of
the
slaves
the
use
of
the
whip
was
denied
all
severe
and
arbitrary
punishments
were
abolished
the
laborers
received
wages
and
their
offences
were
all
tried
by
a
sort
of
negro
court
established
among
themselves
in
short
they
were
practically
free
under
this
system
in
four
years
and
three
months
there
were
births
and
but
deaths
and
the
annual
net
produce
of
the
plantation
was
more
than
three
times
what
it
had
been
english
quarterly
magazine
and
review
april
the
following
evidence
was
adduced
by
pitt
in
the
british
parliament
april
the
assembly
of
grenada
had
themselves
stated
that
though
the
negroes
were
allowed
only
the
afternoon
of
one
day
in
a
week
they
would
do
as
much
work
in
that
afternoon
when
employed
for
their
own
benefit
as
in
the
whole
day
when
employed
in
their
master
service
now
after
this
confession
said
pitt
the
house
might
burn
all
its
calculations
relative
to
the
negro
population
a
negro
if
he
worked
for
himself
could
no
doubt
do
double
work
by
an
improvement
then
in
the
mode
of
labor
the
work
in
the
islands
could
be
doubled
in
coffee
districts
it
is
usual
for
the
master
to
hire
his
people
after
they
have
done
the
regular
task
for
the
day
at
a
rate
varying
from
to
for
every
extra
bushel
which
they
pluck
from
the
trees
and
many
almost
all
are
found
eager
to
earn
their
wages
in
a
report
made
by
the
commandant
of
castries
for
the
government
of
lucia
in
it
is
stated
in
proof
of
the
intimacy
between
the
slaves
and
the
free
blacks
that
many
small
plantations
of
the
latter
and
occupied
by
only
one
man
and
his
wife
are
better
cultivated
and
have
more
land
in
cultivation
than
those
of
the
proprietors
of
many
slaves
and
that
the
labor
on
them
is
performed
by
runaway
slaves
thus
clearly
proving
that
even
runaway
slaves
under
the
fears
of
discovery
and
oppression
labor
well
because
the
fruits
of
their
labor
are
immediately
their
own
let
us
look
at
this
subject
from
another
point
of
view
the
large
sum
of
money
necessary
for
stocking
a
plantation
with
slaves
has
an
inevitable
tendency
to
place
the
agriculture
of
a
community
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
the
wealthy
a
tendency
at
war
with
practical
republicanism
and
conflicting
with
the
best
maxims
of
political
economy
two
hundred
slaves
at
per
head
would
cost
in
the
outset
compare
this
enormous
outlay
for
the
labor
of
a
single
plantation
with
the
beautiful
system
of
free
labor
as
exhibited
in
new
england
where
every
young
laborer
with
health
and
ordinary
prudence
may
acquire
by
his
labor
on
the
farms
of
others
in
a
few
years
a
farm
of
his
own
and
the
stock
necessary
for
its
proper
cultivation
where
on
a
hard
and
unthankful
soil
independence
and
competence
may
be
attained
by
all
free
labor
is
perfectly
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
our
institutions
slave
labor
is
a
relic
of
a
barbarous
despotic
age
the
one
like
the
firmament
of
heaven
is
the
equal
diffusion
of
similar
lights
manifest
harmonious
regular
the
other
is
the
fiery
predominance
of
some
disastrous
star
hiding
all
lesser
luminaries
around
it
in
one
consuming
glare
emancipation
would
reform
this
evil
the
planter
would
no
longer
be
under
the
necessity
of
a
heavy
expenditure
for
slaves
he
would
only
pay
a
very
moderate
price
for
his
labor
a
price
indeed
far
less
than
the
cost
of
the
maintenance
of
a
promiscuous
gang
of
slaves
which
the
present
system
requires
in
an
old
plantation
of
three
hundred
slaves
not
more
than
one
hundred
effective
laborers
will
be
found
children
the
old
and
superannuated
the
sick
and
decrepit
the
idle
and
incorrigibly
vicious
will
be
found
to
constitute
two
thirds
of
the
whole
number
the
remaining
third
perform
only
about
one
third
as
much
work
as
the
same
number
of
free
laborers
now
disburden
the
master
of
this
heavy
load
of
maintenance
let
him
employ
free
able
industrious
laborers
only
those
who
feel
conscious
of
a
personal
interest
in
the
fruits
of
their
labor
and
who
does
not
see
that
such
a
system
would
be
vastly
more
safe
and
economical
than
the
present
the
slave
states
are
learning
this
truth
by
fatal
experience
most
of
them
are
silently
writhing
under
the
great
curse
virginia
has
uttered
her
complaints
aloud
as
yet
however
nothing
has
been
done
even
there
save
a
small
annual
appropriation
for
the
purpose
of
colonizing
the
free
colored
inhabitants
of
the
state
is
this
a
remedy
but
it
may
be
said
that
virginia
will
ultimately
liberate
her
slaves
on
condition
of
their
colonization
in
africa
peacefully
if
possible
forcibly
if
necessary
well
admitting
that
virginia
may
be
able
and
willing
at
some
remote
period
to
rid
herself
of
the
evil
by
commuting
the
punishment
of
her
unoffending
colored
people
from
slavery
to
exile
will
her
fearful
remedy
apply
to
some
of
the
other
slaveholding
states
it
is
a
fact
strongly
insisted
upon
by
our
southern
brethren
as
a
reason
for
the
perpetuation
of
slavery
that
their
climate
and
peculiar
agriculture
will
not
admit
of
hard
labor
on
the
part
of
the
whites
that
amidst
the
fatal
malaria
of
the
rice
plantations
the
white
man
is
almost
annually
visited
by
the
country
fever
that
few
of
the
white
overseers
of
these
plantations
reach
the
middle
period
of
ordinary
life
that
the
owners
are
compelled
to
fly
from
their
estates
as
the
hot
season
approaches
without
being
able
to
return
until
the
first
frosts
have
fallen
but
we
are
told
that
the
slaves
remain
there
at
their
work
in
putrid
water
breathing
the
noisome
atmosphere
loaded
with
contagion
and
underneath
the
scorching
fervor
of
a
terrible
sun
that
they
indeed
suffer
but
that
their
habits
constitutions
and
their
long
practice
enable
them
to
labor
surrounded
by
such
destructive
influences
with
comparative
safety
the
conclusive
answer
therefore
to
those
who
in
reality
cherish
the
visionary
hope
of
colonizing
all
the
colored
people
of
the
united
states
in
africa
or
elsewhere
is
this
single
fact
the
labor
of
the
blacks
will
not
and
can
not
be
dispensed
with
by
the
planter
of
the
south
to
what
remedy
then
can
the
friends
of
humanity
betake
themselves
but
to
that
of
emancipation
and
nothing
but
a
strong
unequivocal
expression
of
public
sentiment
is
needed
to
carry
into
effect
this
remedy
so
far
as
the
general
government
is
concerned
and
when
the
voice
of
all
the
states
shall
be
heard
on
this
question
a
voice
of
expostulation
rebuke
entreaty
when
the
full
light
of
truth
shall
break
through
the
night
of
prejudice
and
reveal
all
the
foul
abominations
of
slavery
will
delaware
still
cling
to
the
curse
which
is
wasting
her
moral
strength
and
still
rivet
the
fetters
upon
her
three
or
four
thousand
slaves
let
delaware
begin
the
work
and
maryland
and
virginia
must
follow
the
example
will
be
contagious
and
the
great
object
of
universal
emancipation
will
be
attained
freemen
christians
lovers
of
truth
and
justice
why
stand
ye
idle
ours
is
a
government
of
opinion
and
slavery
is
interwoven
with
it
change
the
current
of
opinion
and
slavery
will
be
swept
away
let
the
awful
sovereignty
of
the
people
a
power
which
is
limited
only
by
the
sovereignty
of
heaven
arise
and
pronounce
judgment
against
the
crying
iniquity
let
each
individual
remember
that
upon
himself
rests
a
portion
of
that
sovereignty
a
part
of
the
tremendous
responsibility
of
its
exercise
the
burning
withering
concentration
of
public
opinion
upon
the
slave
system
is
alone
needed
for
its
total
annihilation
god
has
given
us
the
power
to
overthrow
it
a
power
peaceful
yet
mighty
benevolent
yet
effectual
awful
without
severity
a
moral
strength
equal
to
the
emergency
how
does
it
happen
inquires
an
able
writer
that
whenever
duty
is
named
we
begin
to
hear
of
the
weakness
of
human
nature
that
same
nature
which
outruns
the
whirlwind
in
the
chase
of
gain
which
rages
like
a
maniac
at
the
trumpet
call
of
glory
which
laughs
danger
and
death
to
scorn
when
its
least
passion
is
awakened
becomes
weak
as
childhood
when
reminded
of
the
claims
of
duty
but
let
no
one
hope
to
find
an
excuse
in
hypocrisy
the
humblest
individual
of
the
community
in
one
way
or
another
possesses
influence
and
upon
him
as
well
as
upon
the
proudest
rests
the
responsibility
of
its
rightful
exercise
and
proper
direction
the
overthrow
of
a
great
national
evil
like
that
of
slavery
can
only
be
effected
by
the
united
energies
of
the
great
body
of
the
people
shoulder
must
be
put
to
shoulder
and
hand
linked
with
hand
the
whole
mass
must
be
put
in
motion
and
its
entire
strength
applied
until
the
fabric
of
oppression
is
shaken
to
its
dark
foundations
and
not
one
stone
is
left
upon
another
let
the
christian
remember
that
the
god
of
his
worship
hateth
oppression
that
the
mystery
of
faith
can
only
be
held
by
a
pure
conscience
and
that
in
vain
is
the
tithe
of
mint
and
anise
and
cummin
if
the
weihtier
matters
of
the
law
judgment
mercy
and
truth
are
forgotten
let
him
remember
that
all
along
the
clouded
region
of
slavery
the
truths
of
the
everlasting
gospel
are
not
spoken
that
the
ear
of
iniquity
is
lulled
that
those
who
minister
between
the
porch
and
the
altar
dare
not
speak
out
the
language
of
eternal
justice
is
not
this
the
fast
which
i
have
chosen
to
loose
the
bands
of
wickedness
to
undo
the
heavy
burdens
and
to
let
the
oppressed
go
free
isa
viii
he
that
stealeth
a
man
and
selleth
him
or
if
he
be
found
in
his
hand
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
exod
xxi
yet
a
little
while
and
the
voice
of
impartial
prayer
for
humanity
will
be
heard
no
more
in
the
abiding
place
of
slavery
the
truths
of
the
gospel
its
voice
of
warning
and
exhortation
will
be
denounced
as
incendiary
the
night
of
that
infidelity
which
denies
god
in
the
abuse
and
degradation
of
man
will
settle
over
the
land
to
be
broken
only
by
the
upheaving
earthquake
of
eternal
retribution
to
the
members
of
the
religious
society
of
friends
i
would
earnestly
appeal
they
have
already
done
much
to
put
away
the
evil
of
slavery
in
this
country
and
great
britain
the
blessings
of
many
who
were
ready
to
perish
have
rested
upon
them
but
their
faithful
testimony
must
be
still
steadily
upborne
for
the
great
work
is
but
begun
let
them
not
relax
their
exertions
nor
be
contented
with
a
lifeless
testimony
a
formal
protestation
against
the
evil
active
prayerful
unwearied
exertion
is
needed
for
its
overthrow
but
above
all
let
them
not
aid
in
excusing
and
palliating
it
slavery
has
no
redeeming
qualities
no
feature
of
benevolence
nothing
pure
nothing
peaceful
nothing
just
let
them
carefully
keep
themselves
aloof
from
all
societies
and
all
schemes
which
have
a
tendency
to
excuse
or
overlook
its
crying
iniquity
true
to
a
doctrine
founded
on
love
and
mercy
peace
on
earth
and
good
will
to
men
they
should
regard
the
suffering
slave
as
their
brother
and
endeavor
to
put
their
souls
in
his
soul
stead
they
may
earnestly
desire
the
civilization
of
africa
but
they
can
not
aid
in
building
up
the
colony
of
liberia
so
long
as
that
colony
leans
for
support
upon
the
arm
of
military
power
so
long
as
it
proselytes
to
christianity
under
the
muzzles
of
its
cannon
and
preaches
the
doctrines
of
christ
while
practising
those
of
mahomet
when
the
sierra
leone
company
was
formed
in
england
not
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
engage
in
it
because
the
colony
was
to
be
supplied
with
cannon
and
other
military
stores
yet
the
foreign
agent
of
the
liberia
colony
society
to
which
the
same
insurmountable
objection
exists
is
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
and
i
understand
has
been
recently
employed
in
providing
gunpowder
for
the
use
of
the
colony
there
must
be
an
awakening
on
this
subject
other
woolmans
and
other
benezets
must
arise
and
speak
the
truth
with
the
meek
love
of
james
and
the
fervent
sincerity
of
paul
to
the
women
of
america
whose
sympathies
know
no
distinction
of
cline
or
sect
or
color
the
suffering
slave
is
making
a
strong
appeal
oh
let
it
not
be
unheeded
for
of
those
to
whom
much
is
given
much
will
be
required
at
the
last
dread
tribunal
and
never
in
the
strongest
terms
of
human
eulogy
was
woman
influence
overrated
sisters
daughters
wives
and
mothers
your
influence
is
felt
everywhere
at
the
fireside
and
in
the
halls
of
legislation
surrounding
like
the
atmosphere
brother
and
father
husband
and
son
and
by
your
love
of
them
by
every
holy
sympathy
of
your
bosoms
by
every
mournful
appeal
which
comes
up
to
you
from
hearts
whose
sanctuary
of
affections
has
been
made
waste
and
desolate
you
are
called
upon
to
exert
it
in
the
cause
of
redemption
from
wrong
and
outrage
let
the
patriot
the
friend
of
liberty
and
the
union
of
the
states
no
longer
shut
his
eyes
to
the
great
danger
the
before
which
all
others
dwindle
into
insignificance
our
union
is
tottering
to
its
foundation
and
slavery
is
the
cause
remove
the
evil
dry
up
at
their
source
the
bitter
waters
in
vain
you
enact
and
abrogate
your
tariffs
in
vain
is
individual
sacrifice
or
sectional
concession
the
accursed
thing
is
with
us
the
stone
of
stumbling
and
the
rock
of
offence
remains
drag
then
the
achan
into
light
and
let
national
repentance
atone
for
national
sin
the
conflicting
interests
of
free
and
slave
labor
furnish
the
only
ground
for
fear
in
relation
to
the
permanency
of
the
union
the
line
of
separation
between
them
is
day
by
day
growing
broader
and
deeper
geographically
and
politically
united
we
are
already
in
a
moral
point
of
view
a
divided
people
but
a
few
months
ago
we
were
on
the
very
verge
of
civil
war
a
war
of
brothers
a
war
between
the
north
and
the
south
between
the
and
the
free
laborer
the
danger
has
been
delayed
for
a
time
this
bolt
has
fallen
without
mortal
injury
to
the
union
but
the
cloud
from
whence
it
came
still
hangs
above
us
reddening
with
the
elements
of
destruction
recent
events
have
furnished
ample
proof
that
the
interest
is
prepared
to
resist
any
legislation
on
the
part
of
the
general
government
which
is
supposed
to
have
a
tendency
directly
or
indirectly
to
encourage
and
invigorate
free
labor
and
that
it
is
determined
to
charge
upon
its
opposite
interest
the
infliction
of
all
those
evils
which
necessarily
attend
its
own
operation
the
primeval
curse
of
omnipotence
upon
slavery
we
have
already
felt
in
too
many
instances
the
extreme
difficulty
of
cherishing
in
one
common
course
of
national
legislation
the
opposite
interests
of
republican
equality
and
feudal
aristocracy
and
servitude
the
truth
is
we
have
undertaken
a
moral
impossibility
these
interests
are
from
their
nature
irreconcilable
the
one
is
based
upon
the
pure
principles
of
rational
liberty
the
other
under
the
name
of
freedom
revives
the
ancient
european
system
of
barons
and
villains
nobles
and
serfs
indeed
the
state
of
society
which
existed
among
our
ancestors
was
far
more
tolerable
than
that
of
many
portions
of
our
republican
confederacy
for
the
slaves
had
it
in
their
power
to
purchase
their
freedom
and
the
laws
of
the
realm
recognized
their
liberation
and
placed
them
under
legal
protection
the
diffusion
of
christianity
in
great
britain
was
moreover
followed
by
a
general
manumission
for
it
would
seem
that
the
priests
and
missionaries
of
religion
in
that
early
and
benighted
age
were
more
faithful
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
than
those
of
the
present
the
holy
fathers
monks
and
friars
says
sir
smith
had
in
their
confessions
and
specially
in
their
extreme
and
deadly
sickness
convinced
the
laity
how
dangerous
a
thing
it
was
for
one
christian
to
hold
another
in
bondage
so
that
temporal
men
by
reason
of
the
terror
in
their
consciences
were
glad
to
manumit
all
their
hilt
commonwealth
blackstone
p
to
counteract
the
dangers
resulting
from
a
state
of
society
so
utterly
at
variance
with
the
great
declaration
of
american
freedom
should
be
the
earnest
endeavor
of
every
patriotic
statesman
nothing
unconstitutional
nothing
violent
should
be
attempted
but
the
true
doctrine
of
the
rights
of
man
should
be
steadily
kept
in
view
and
the
opposition
to
slavery
should
be
inflexible
and
constantly
maintained
the
almost
daily
violations
of
the
constitution
in
consequence
of
the
laws
of
some
of
the
slave
states
subjecting
free
colored
citizens
of
new
england
and
elsewhere
who
may
happen
to
be
on
board
of
our
coasting
vessels
to
imprisonment
immediately
on
their
arrival
in
a
southern
port
should
be
provided
against
nor
should
the
imprisonment
of
the
free
colored
citizens
of
the
northern
and
middle
states
on
suspicion
of
being
runaways
subjecting
them
even
after
being
pronounced
free
to
the
costs
of
their
confinement
and
trial
be
longer
tolerated
for
if
we
continue
to
yield
to
innovations
like
these
upon
the
constitution
of
our
fathers
we
shall
erelong
have
the
name
only
of
a
free
government
left
us
dissemble
as
we
may
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
believe
after
fully
considering
the
nature
of
slavery
that
it
can
much
longer
maintain
a
peaceable
existence
among
us
a
day
of
revolution
must
come
and
it
is
our
duty
to
prepare
for
it
its
threatened
evil
may
be
changed
into
a
national
blessing
the
establishment
of
schools
for
the
instruction
of
the
slave
children
a
general
diffusion
of
the
lights
of
christianity
and
the
introduction
of
a
sacred
respect
for
the
social
obligations
of
marriage
and
for
the
relations
between
parents
and
children
among
our
black
population
would
render
emancipation
not
only
perfectly
safe
but
also
of
the
highest
advantage
to
the
country
two
millions
of
freemen
would
be
added
to
our
population
upon
whom
in
the
hour
of
danger
we
could
safely
depend
the
domestic
foe
would
be
changed
into
a
firm
friend
faithful
generous
and
ready
to
encounter
all
dangers
in
our
defence
it
is
well
known
that
during
the
last
war
with
great
britain
wherever
the
enemy
touched
upon
our
southern
coast
the
slaves
in
multitudes
hastened
to
join
them
on
the
other
hand
the
free
blacks
were
highly
serviceable
in
repelling
them
so
warm
was
the
zeal
of
the
latter
so
manifest
their
courage
in
the
defence
of
louisiana
that
the
present
chief
magistrate
of
the
united
states
publicly
bestowed
upon
them
one
of
the
highest
eulogiums
ever
offered
by
a
commander
to
his
soldiers
let
no
one
seek
an
apology
for
silence
on
the
subject
of
slavery
because
the
laws
of
the
land
tolerate
and
sanction
it
but
a
short
time
ago
the
was
protected
by
laws
and
treaties
and
sanctioned
by
the
example
of
men
eminent
for
the
reputation
of
piety
and
integrity
yet
public
opinion
broke
over
these
barriers
it
lifted
the
curtain
and
revealed
the
horrors
of
that
most
abominable
traffic
and
unrighteous
law
and
ancient
custom
and
avarice
and
luxury
gave
way
before
its
irresistible
authority
it
should
never
be
forgotten
that
human
law
can
not
change
the
nature
of
human
action
in
the
pure
eye
of
infinite
justice
and
that
the
ordinances
of
man
can
not
annul
those
of
god
the
slave
system
as
existing
in
this
country
can
be
considered
in
no
other
light
than
as
the
cause
of
which
the
foul
traffic
in
human
flesh
is
the
legitimate
consequence
it
is
the
parent
the
fosterer
the
sole
supporter
of
the
it
creates
the
demand
for
slaves
and
the
foreign
supply
will
always
be
equal
to
the
demand
of
consumption
it
keeps
the
market
open
it
offers
inducements
to
the
which
no
severity
of
law
against
his
traffic
can
overcome
by
our
laws
his
trade
is
piracy
while
slavery
to
which
alone
it
owes
its
existence
is
protected
and
cherished
and
those
engaged
in
it
are
rewarded
by
an
increase
of
political
power
proportioned
to
the
increase
of
their
stock
of
human
beings
to
steal
the
natives
of
africa
is
a
crime
worthy
of
an
ignominious
death
but
to
steal
and
enslave
annually
nearly
one
hundred
thousand
of
the
descendants
of
these
stolen
natives
born
in
this
country
is
considered
altogether
excusable
and
proper
for
my
own
part
i
know
no
difference
between
robbery
in
africa
and
robbery
at
home
i
could
with
as
quiet
a
conscience
engage
in
the
one
as
the
other
there
is
not
one
general
principle
justly
remarks
lord
nugent
on
which
the
is
to
be
stigmatized
which
does
not
impeach
slavery
itself
kindred
in
iniquity
both
must
fall
speedily
fall
together
and
be
consigned
to
the
same
dishonorable
grave
the
spirit
which
is
thrilling
through
every
nerve
of
england
is
awakening
america
from
her
sleep
of
death
who
among
our
statesmen
would
not
shrink
from
the
baneful
reputation
of
having
supported
by
his
legislative
influence
the
the
traffic
in
human
flesh
let
them
then
beware
for
the
time
is
near
at
hand
when
the
present
defenders
of
slavery
will
sink
under
the
same
fatal
reputation
and
leave
to
posterity
a
memory
which
will
blacken
through
all
future
time
a
legacy
of
infamy
let
us
not
betake
us
to
the
common
arts
and
stratagems
of
nations
but
fear
god
and
put
away
the
evil
which
provokes
him
and
trust
not
in
man
but
in
the
living
god
and
it
shall
go
well
for
england
this
counsel
given
by
the
purehearted
william
penn
in
a
former
age
is
about
to
be
followed
in
the
present
an
intense
and
powerful
feeling
is
working
in
the
mighty
heart
of
england
it
is
speaking
through
the
lips
of
brougham
and
buxton
and
and
demanding
justice
in
the
name
of
humanity
and
according
to
the
righteous
law
of
god
the
immediate
emancipation
of
eight
hundred
thousand
slaves
is
demanded
with
an
authority
which
can
not
much
longer
be
disputed
or
trifled
with
that
demand
will
be
obeyed
justice
will
be
done
the
heavy
burdens
will
be
unloosed
the
oppressed
set
free
it
shall
go
well
for
england
and
when
the
stain
on
our
own
escutcheon
shall
be
seen
no
more
when
the
declaration
of
our
independence
and
the
practice
of
our
people
shall
agree
when
truth
shall
be
exalted
among
us
when
love
shall
take
the
place
of
wrong
when
all
the
baneful
pride
and
prejudice
of
caste
and
color
shall
fall
forever
when
under
one
common
sun
of
political
liberty
the
portions
of
our
republic
shall
no
longer
sit
like
the
egyptians
of
old
themselves
mantled
in
thick
darkness
while
all
around
them
is
glowing
with
the
blessed
light
of
freedom
and
equality
then
and
not
till
then
shall
it
go
well
for
america
the
abolitionists
their
sentiments
and
objects
two
letters
to
the
and
times
richmond
va
i
a
friend
has
banded
me
a
late
number
of
your
paper
containing
a
brief
notice
of
a
pamphlet
which
i
have
recently
published
on
the
subject
of
slavery
from
an
occasional
perusal
of
your
paper
i
have
formed
a
favorable
opinion
of
your
talent
and
independence
compelled
to
dissent
from
some
of
your
political
sentiments
i
still
give
you
full
credit
for
the
lofty
tone
of
sincerity
and
manliness
with
which
these
sentiments
are
avowed
and
defended
i
perceive
that
since
the
adjustment
of
the
tariff
question
a
new
subject
of
discontent
and
agitation
seems
to
engross
your
attention
the
accursed
tariff
has
no
sooner
ceased
to
be
the
stone
of
stumbling
and
the
rock
of
offence
than
the
abolition
doctrines
of
the
northern
enthusiasts
as
you
are
pleased
to
term
the
doctrines
of
your
own
jefferson
furnish
in
your
opinion
a
sufficient
reason
for
poising
the
ancient
dominion
on
its
sovereignty
and
rousing
every
slaveowner
to
military
preparations
until
the
entire
south
from
the
potomac
to
the
gulf
shall
bristle
with
bayonets
like
quills
upon
the
fretful
porcupine
in
proof
of
a
conspiracy
against
your
vested
rights
you
have
commenced
publishing
copious
extracts
from
the
pamphlets
and
periodicals
of
the
abolitionists
of
new
england
and
new
york
an
extract
from
my
own
pamphlet
you
have
headed
the
fanatics
and
in
introducing
it
to
your
readers
you
inform
them
that
it
exhibits
in
strong
colors
the
morbid
spirit
of
that
false
and
fanatical
philanthropy
which
is
at
work
in
the
northern
states
and
to
some
extent
in
the
south
gentlemen
so
far
as
i
am
personally
concerned
in
the
matter
i
feel
no
disposition
to
take
exceptions
to
any
epithets
which
you
may
see
fit
to
apply
to
me
or
my
writings
a
humble
son
of
new
england
a
tiller
of
her
rugged
soil
and
a
companion
of
her
unostentatious
yeomanry
it
matters
little
in
any
personal
consideration
of
the
subject
whether
the
voice
of
praise
or
opprobrium
reaches
me
from
beyond
the
narrow
limits
of
my
immediate
neighborhood
but
when
i
find
my
opinions
quoted
as
the
sentiment
of
new
england
and
then
denounced
as
dangerous
false
and
fanatical
and
especially
when
i
see
them
made
the
occasion
of
earnest
appeals
to
the
prejudices
and
sectional
jealousies
of
the
south
it
becomes
me
to
endeavor
to
establish
their
truths
and
defend
them
from
illegitimate
influences
and
unjust
suspicions
in
the
first
place
then
let
me
say
that
if
it
be
criminal
to
publicly
express
a
belief
that
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
slave
states
to
emancipate
their
slaves
with
profit
and
safety
to
themselves
and
that
such
is
their
immediate
duty
a
majority
of
the
people
of
new
england
are
wholly
guiltless
of
course
all
are
nominally
opposed
to
slavery
but
upon
the
little
band
of
abolitionists
should
the
anathemas
of
the
holder
be
directed
for
they
are
the
agitators
of
whom
you
complain
men
who
are
acting
under
a
solemn
conviction
of
duty
and
who
are
bending
every
energy
of
their
minds
to
the
accomplishment
of
their
object
and
that
object
is
the
overthrow
of
slavery
in
the
united
states
by
such
means
only
as
are
sanctioned
by
law
humanity
and
religion
i
shall
endeavor
gentlemen
as
briefly
as
may
be
to
give
you
some
of
our
reasons
for
opposing
slavery
and
seeking
its
abolition
and
secondly
to
explain
our
mode
of
operation
to
disclose
our
plan
of
emancipation
fully
and
entirely
we
wish
to
do
nothing
darkly
frank
republicans
we
acknowledge
no
at
this
busy
season
of
the
year
i
can
not
but
regret
that
i
have
not
leisure
for
such
a
deliberate
examination
of
the
subject
as
even
my
poor
ability
might
warrant
my
remarks
penned
in
the
intervals
of
labor
must
necessarily
be
brief
and
wanting
in
coherence
we
seek
the
abolishment
of
slavery
because
it
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
god
in
your
paper
of
the
of
the
same
in
which
you
denounce
the
false
and
fanatical
philanthropy
of
abolitionists
you
avow
yourselves
members
of
the
bible
society
and
bestow
warm
and
deserved
encomiums
on
the
truly
pious
undertaking
of
sending
the
truth
among
all
nations
you
therefore
gentlemen
whatever
others
may
do
will
not
accuse
me
of
fanaticism
if
i
endeavor
to
sustain
my
first
great
reason
for
opposing
slavery
by
a
reference
to
the
volume
of
inspiration
therefore
all
things
whatsoever
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
even
so
to
them
wherefore
now
let
the
fear
of
the
lord
be
upon
you
take
heed
and
do
it
for
there
is
no
iniquity
with
the
lord
nor
respect
of
persons
is
not
this
the
fast
that
i
have
chosen
to
loose
the
bands
of
wickedness
to
undo
the
heavy
burdens
and
let
the
oppressed
go
free
and
that
ye
break
every
yoke
if
a
man
be
found
stealing
any
of
his
brethren
and
maketh
merchandise
of
him
or
selling
him
that
thief
shall
die
of
a
truth
i
perceive
that
god
is
no
respecter
of
persons
and
he
that
stealeth
a
man
and
selleth
him
or
if
he
be
found
in
his
hands
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
because
it
is
an
open
violation
of
all
human
equality
of
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
nations
the
fundamental
principle
of
all
equal
and
just
law
is
contained
in
the
following
extract
from
blackstone
commentaries
introduction
sec
the
rights
which
god
and
nature
have
established
and
which
are
therefore
called
natural
rights
such
as
life
and
liberty
need
not
the
aid
of
human
laws
to
be
more
effectually
vested
in
every
man
than
they
are
neither
do
they
receive
any
additional
strength
when
declared
by
municipal
laws
to
be
inviolable
on
the
contrary
no
human
legislation
has
power
to
abridge
or
destroy
there
unless
the
owner
shall
himself
commit
some
act
that
amounts
to
a
forfeiture
has
the
negro
committed
such
offence
above
all
has
his
infant
child
forfeited
its
unalienable
right
surely
it
can
be
no
act
of
the
innocent
child
yet
you
must
prove
the
forfeiture
or
no
human
legislation
can
deprive
that
child
of
its
freedom
its
black
skin
constitutes
the
forfeiture

of
all
which
makes
the
boon

their

we
hold
these
truths
to
be
that

that
they
are

by
their

with
certain
unalienable
rights

among

gentlemen
i
might
summon
to
my

a

a
host
of
incontrovertible
damning

the
legitimate
results
of
a

whose
tendency
is
to
harden

deprave
the
heart
but
i
will
not
descend
to
particulars
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
the
majority
of
the
masters
of
your
section
of
the
country
are
disposed
to
treat
their
unfortunate
slaves
with
kindness
but
where
the
dreadful
privilege
of
is
extended
to
all
in
every
neighborhood
there
must
be
individuals
whose
cupidity
is
unrestrained
by
any
principle
of

whose
lusts
are
fiercely
indulged
whose
fearful
power
over
the

nay
may
i
not
say
the
souls
of
their

is
daily
and
hourly
abused
will
the
evidence
of
your
own
jefferson
on
this
point
be
admissible
the
whole
commerce
between
master

is
a
perpetual
exercise
of
the

boisterous

the
most
unremitting
despotism
on

any

the
brutal
the
revengeful
the

acting

can
not

you
will
perhaps
tell
me
that
the
general
law
against
murder
applies
alike
to
master
and
slave
true
but
will
you
point
out
instances
of
masters
suffering
the
penalty
of
that
law
for
the
murder
of
their
slaves
if
you
examine
your
judicial
reports
you
will
find
the
wilful
murder
of
a
slave
decided
to
be
only
a
trespass
virginia
reports

it
indeed
argues
well
for
virginian
pride
of
character
that
latterly
the
law
which
expressly
sanctioned
the
murder
of
a
slave
who
in
the
language
of
georgia
and
north
carolina
died
of
moderate
correction
has
been
repealed
but
although
the
letter
of
the
law
is
changed
its
practice
remains
the
same
in
proof
of
this
i
would
refer
to
brockenborough
and
holmes

cases
in
georgia
and
north

the
murder
of

is
tolerated
and

he

the

at

any

notwithstanding
is
not
this
offering
a

for

and
what
shall
we
think
of
that
misnamed
court
of
justice
where
it
is
optional
with
the
witnesses
in
a
case
of
life
and
death
to
give
or
withhold
their
testimony
because
it
induces
dangerous
sectional
jealousies
creates
of
necessity
a
struggle
between
the
opposing
interests
of
free
and
slave
labor
and
threatens
the
integrity
of
the

that
sectional
jealousies
do
exist
the
tone
of
your
paper
gentlemen
is
of
itself
an
evidence
if
indeed
any
were
needed
the
moral
sentiment
of
the
free
states
is
against
slavery
the
freeman
has
declared
his
unwillingness
that
his
labor
should
be
reduced
to
a
level
with
that
of
slaves
harsh
epithets
and
harsh
threats
have
been
freely
exchanged
until
the
beautiful
potomac
wherever
it
winds
its
way
to
the
ocean
has
become
the
dividing
line
not
of
territory
only
but
of
feeling
interest
national
pride
a
moral
division
what
shook
the
pillars
of
the
union
when
the
missouri
question
was
agitated
what
but
a
few
months
ago
arrayed
in
arms
a
state
against
the
union
and
the
union
against
a
state
from
maine
to
florida
gentlemen
the
answer
must
be
the
same
slavery
because
of
its
pernicious
influence
upon
national
wealth
and
prosperity
political
economy
has
been
the
peculiar
study
of
virginia
but
there
are
some
important
truths
connected
with
this
science
which
she
has
hitherto
overlooked
or
wantonly
disregarded
population
increasing
with
the
means
of
subsistence
is
a
fair
test
of
national
wealth
by
reference
to
the
several
censuses
of
the
united
states
it
will
be
seen
that
the
white
population
increases
nearly
twice
as
fast
in
states
where
there
are
few
or
no
slaves
as
in
the
slave
states
again
in
the
latter
states
the
slave
population
has
increased
twice
as
fast
as
the
white
let
us
take
for
example
the
period
of
twenty
years
from
to
and
compare
the
increase
of
the
two
classes
in
three
of
the
southern
states
per
cent
of
whites
per
cent
of
blacks
maryland
virginia
north
carolina
the
causes
of
this
disproportionate
increase
so
inimical
to
the
true
interests
of
the
country
are
very
manifest
a
large
proportion
of
the
free
inhabitants
of
the
united
states
are
dependent
upon
their
labor
for
subsistence
the
forced
unnatural
system
of
slavery
in
some
of
the
states
renders
the
demand
for
free
laborers
less
urgent
they
are
not
so
readily
and
abundantly
supplied
with
the
means
of
subsistence
as
those
of
their
own
class
in
the
free
states
and
as
the
necessaries
of
life
diminish
population
also
diminishes
there
is
yet
another
cause
for
the
decline
of
the
white
population
in
the
free
states
labor
is
reputable
the
statesman
whose
eloquence
has
electrified
a
nation
does
not
disdain
in
the
intervals
of
the
public
service
to
handle
the
axe
and
the
hoe
and
the
woman
whose
beauty
talents
and
accomplishments
have
won
the
admiration
of
all
deems
it
no
degradation
to
look
well
to
her
household
but
the
slave
stamps
with
indelible
ignominy
the
character
of
occupation
it
is
a
disgrace
for
a
highborn
virginian
or
chivalrous
carolinian
to
labor
side
by
side
with
the
low
despised
miserable
black
man
wretched
must
be
the
condition
of
the
poorer
classes
of
whites
in
a
community
compelled
to
perform
the
despised
offices
of
the
slave
they
can
hardly
rise
above
his
level
they
become
the
pariahs
of
society
no
wonder
then
that
the
tide
of
emigration
flows
from
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
to
the
free
valleys
of
the
west
in
new
england
the
labor
of
a
farmer
or
mechanic
is
worth
from
to
per
annum
that
of
a
female
from
to
our
entire
population
with
the
exception
of
those
engaged
in
mercantile
affairs
the
professional
classes
and
a
very
few
moneyed
idlers
are
working
men
and
women
if
that
of
the
south
were
equally
employed
and
slavery
apart
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
how
large
an
addition
would
be
annually
made
to
the
wealth
of
the
country
the
truth
is
a
very
considerable
portion
of
the
national
wealth
produced
by
northern
labor
is
taxed
to
defray
the
expenses
of
representatives
of
southern
property
in
congress
and
to
maintain
an
army
mainly
for
the
protection
of
the
against
the
dangerous
tendencies
of
that
property
in
the
early
and
better
days
of
the
roman
republic
the
ancient
warriors
and
statesmen
cultivated
their
fields
with
their
own
hands
but
so
soon
as
their
agriculture
was
left
to
the
slaves
it
visibly
declined
the
once
fertile
fields
became
pastures
and
the
inhabitants
of
that
garden
of
the
world
were
dependent
upon
foreign
nations
for
the
necessaries
of
life
the
beautiful
villages
once
peopled
by
free
contented
laborers
became
tenantless
and
over
the
waste
of
solitude
we
see
here
and
there
at
weary
distances
the
palaces
of
the
master
contrasting
painfully
with
the
wretched
cottages
and
subterranean
cells
of
the
slave
in
speaking
of
the
extraordinary
fertility
of
the
soil
in
the
early
times
of
the
republic
pliny
inquires
what
was
the
cause
of
these
abundant
harvests
it
was
this
that
men
of
rank
employed
themselves
in
the
culture
of
the
fields
whereas
now
it
is
left
to
wretches
loaded
with
fetters
who
carry
in
their
countenances
the
shameful
evidence
of
their
slavery
and
what
was
true
in
the
days
of
the
roman
is
now
written
legibly
upon
the
soil
of
your
own
virginia
a
traveller
in
your
state
in
contemplating
the
decline
of
its
agriculture
has
justly
remarked
that
if
the
miserable
condition
of
the
negro
had
left
his
mind
for
reflection
he
would
laugh
in
his
chains
to
see
how
slavery
has
stricken
the
land
with
ugliness
is
the
rapid
increase
of
a
population
of
slaves
in
itself
no
evil
in
all
the
slave
states
the
increase
of
the
slaves
is
vastly
more
rapid
than
that
of
the
whites
or
free
blacks
when
we
recollect
that
they
are
under
no
natural
or
moral
restraint
careless
of
providing
food
or
clothing
for
themselves
or
their
children
when
too
we
consider
that
they
are
raised
as
an
article
of
profitable
traffic
like
the
cattle
of
new
england
and
the
hogs
of
kentucky
that
it
is
a
matter
of
interest
of
dollars
and
cents
to
the
master
that
they
should
multiply
as
fast
as
possible
there
is
surely
nothing
at
all
surprising
in
the
increase
of
their
numbers
would
to
heaven
there
were
also
nothing
alarming
because
by
the
terms
of
the
national
compact
the
free
and
the
slave
states
are
alike
involved
in
the
guilt
of
maintaining
slavery
and
the
citizens
of
the
former
are
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
called
upon
to
aid
the
latter
in
suppressing
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
the
insurrection
of
the
slaves
slavery
is
at
the
best
an
unnatural
state
and
nature
when
her
eternal
principles
are
violated
is
perpetually
struggling
to
restore
them
to
their
first
estate
all
history
ancient
and
modern
is
full
of
warning
on
this
point
need
i
refer
to
the
many
revolts
of
the
roman
and
grecian
slaves
the
bloody
insurrection
of
etruria
the
horrible
servile
wars
of
sicily
and
capua
or
to
come
down
to
later
times
to
france
in
the
fourteenth
century
germany
in
the
sixteenth
to
malta
in
the
last
need
i
call
to
mind
the
untold
horrors
of
domingo
when
that
island
under
the
curse
of
its
servile
war
glowed
redly
in
the
view
of
earth
and
heaven
an
open
hell
have
our
own
peculiar
warnings
gone
by
unheeded
the
frequent
slave
insurrections
of
the
south
one
horrible
tragedy
gentlemen
must
still
be
fresh
in
your
recollection
southampton
with
its
fired
dwellings
and
ghastly
dead
southampton
with
its
dreadful
associations
of
the
death
struggle
with
the
insurgents
the
groans
of
the
tortured
negroes
the
lamentations
of
the
surviving
whites
over
woman
in
her
innocence
and
beauty
and
childhood
and
hoary
age
the
hour
of
emancipation
said
thomas
jefferson
is
advancing
in
the
march
of
time
it
will
come
if
not
brought
on
by
the
generous
energy
of
our
own
minds
it
will
come
by
the
bloody
process
of
st
domingo
to
the
just
and
prophetic
language
of
your
own
great
statesman
i
have
but
a
few
words
to
add
they
shall
be
those
of
truth
and
soberness
we
regard
the
slave
system
in
your
section
of
the
country
as
a
great
evil
moral
and
political
an
evil
which
if
left
to
itself
for
even
a
few
years
longer
will
give
the
entire
south
into
the
hands
of
the
blacks
the
terms
of
the
national
compact
compel
us
to
consider
more
than
two
millions
of
our
as
your
property
not
indeed
morally
really
de
facto
but
still
legally
your
property
we
acknowledge
that
you
have
a
power
derived
from
the
united
states
constitution
to
hold
this
property
but
we
deny
that
you
have
any
moral
right
to
take
advantage
of
that
power
for
truth
will
not
allow
us
to
admit
that
any
human
law
or
compact
can
make
void
or
put
aside
the
ordinance
of
the
living
god
and
the
eternal
laws
of
nature
we
therefore
hold
it
to
be
the
duty
of
the
people
of
the
states
to
begin
the
work
of
emancipation
now
that
any
delay
must
be
dangerous
to
themselves
in
time
and
eternity
and
full
of
injustice
to
their
slaves
and
to
their
brethren
of
the
free
states
because
the
slave
has
never
forfeited
his
right
to
freedom
and
the
continuance
of
his
servitude
is
a
continuance
of
robbery
and
because
in
the
event
of
a
servile
war
the
people
of
the
free
states
would
be
called
upon
to
take
a
part
in
its
unutterable
horrors
new
england
would
obey
that
call
for
she
will
abide
unto
death
by
the
constitution
of
the
land
yet
what
must
be
the
feelings
of
her
citizens
while
engaged
in
hunting
down
like
wild
beasts
their
brutal
and
black
it
may
be
but
still
oppressed
suffering
human
beings
struggling
madly
and
desperately
for
their
liberty
if
they
feel
and
know
that
the
necessity
of
so
doing
has
resulted
from
a
blind
fatality
on
the
part
of
the
oppressor
a
reckless
disregard
of
the
warnings
of
earth
and
heaven
an
obstinate
perseverance
in
a
system
founded
and
sustained
by
robbery
and
wrong
all
wars
are
horrible
wicked
inexcusable
and
truly
and
solemnly
has
jefferson
himself
said
that
in
a
contest
of
this
kind
between
the
slave
and
the
master
the
almighty
has
no
attribute
which
could
take
side
with
us
understand
us
gentlemen
we
only
ask
to
have
the
fearful
necessity
taken
away
from
us
of
sustaining
the
wretched
policy
of
slavery
by
moral
influence
or
physical
force
we
ask
alone
to
be
allowed
to
wash
our
hands
of
the
blood
of
millions
of
your
the
cry
of
whom
is
rising
up
as
a
swift
witness
unto
god
against
us
because
all
the
facts
connected
with
the
subject
warrant
us
in
a
most
confident
belief
that
a
speedy
and
general
emancipation
might
be
made
with
entire
safety
and
that
the
consequences
of
such
an
emancipation
would
be
highly
beneficial
to
the
planters
of
the
south
awful
as
may
be
their
estimate
in
time
and
eternity
i
will
not
gentlemen
dwell
upon
the
priceless
benefits
of
a
conscience
at
rest
a
soul
redeemed
from
the
influences
of
slavery
and
against
which
the
cry
of
the
laborer
whose
hire
has
been
kept
back
by
fraud
does
not
ascend
nor
will
i
rest
the
defence
of
my
position
upon
the
fact
that
it
can
never
be
unsafe
to
obey
the
commands
of
god
these
are
the
old
and
common
arguments
of
fanatics
and
enthusiasts
melting
away
like
in
the
glorious
sunshine
of
expediency
and
utility
in
the
light
of
these
modern
luminaries
then
let
us
reason
together
a
long
and
careful
examination

wherever

in

or
in

a

gentlemen
the

is
tendered
standing
on
your
own
ground
of
expediency
i
am
ready
to
defend
my
position
i
pass
from
the
utility
to
the
safety
of
emancipation
and
here
gentlemen
i
shall
probably
be
met
at
the
outset
with
your
supposed
consequences
bloodshed
rapine
promiscuous
massacre
the
facts
gentlemen
in
god
name
bring
out
your
facts
if
slavery
is
to
cast
over
the
prosperity
of
our
country
the
thick
shadow
of
an
everlasting
curse
because
emancipation
is
dreaded
as
a
remedy
worse
than
the
disease
itself
let
us
know
the
real
grounds
of
your
fear
do
you
find
them
in
the
emancipation
of
the
south
american
republics
in
hayti
in
the
partial
experiments
of
some
of
the
west
india
islands
does
history
ancient
or
modern
justify
your
fears
can
you
find
any
excuse
for
them
in
the
nature
of
the
human
mind
everywhere
maddened
by
injury
and
conciliated
by
kindness
no
gentlemen
the
dangers
of
slavery
are
manifest
and
real
all
history
lies
open
for
your
warning
but
the
dangers
of
emancipation
of
doing
justly
and
loving
mercy
exist
only
in
your
imaginations
you
can
not
produce
one
fact
in
corroboration
of
your
fears
you
can
not
point
to
the
stain
of
a
single
drop
of
any
master
blood
shed
by
the
slave
he
has
emancipated
i
have
now
given
some
of
our
reasons
for
opposing
slavery
in
my
next
letter
i
shall
explain
our
method
of
opposition
and
i
trust
i
shall
be
able
to
show
that
there
is
nothing
fanatical
nothing
unconstitutional
and
nothing
unchristian
in
that
method
in
the
mean
time
gentlemen
i
am
your
friend
and

the
abolitionists
of
the
north
have
been
grossly
misrepresented
in
attacking
the
system
of
slavery
they
have
never
recommended
any
measure
or
measures
conflicting
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
they
have
never
sought
to
excite
or
encourage
a
spirit
of
rebellion
among
the
slaves
on
the
contrary
they
would
hold
any
such
attempt
by
whomsoever
made
in
utter
and
stern
abhorrence
all
the
leading
abolitionists
of
my
acquaintance
are
from
principle
opposed
to
war
of
all
kinds
believing
that
the
benefits
of
no
war
whatever
can
compensate
for
the
sacrifice
of
one
human
life
by
violence
consequently
they
would
be
the
first
to
deprecate
any
physical
interference
with
your
slave
system
on
the
part
of
the
general
government
they
are
without
exception
opposed
to
any
political
interposition
of
the
government
in
regard
to
slavery
as
it
exists
in
the
states
for
although
they
feel
and
see
that
the
canker
of
the
moral
disease
is
affecting
all
parts
of
the
confederacy
they
believe
that
the
remedy
lies
with
yourselves
alone
any
such
interference
they
would
consider
unlawful
and
unconstitutional
and
the
exercise
of
unconstitutional
power
although
sanctioned
by
the
majority
of
a
republican
government
they
believe
to
be
a
tyranny
as
monstrous
and
as
odious
as
the
despotism
of
a
turkish
sultan
having
made
this
disclaimer
on
the
part
of
myself
and
my
friends
let
me
inquire
from
whence
this
charge
of
advocating
the
interference
of
the
general
government
with
the
sovereign
jurisdiction
of
the
states
has
arisen
will
you
gentlemen
will
the
able
editors
of
the
united
states
telegraph
and
the
columbian
telescope
explain
for
myself
i
have
sought
in
vain
among
the
writings
of
our
northern
enthusiasts
and
among
the
speeches
of
the
northern
statesmen
and
politicians
for
some
grounds
for
the
accusation
the
doctrine
such
as
it
is
does
not
belong
to
us
i
think
it
may
be
traced
home
to
the
south
to
virginia
to
her
convention
of
to
the
speech
of
monroe
on
the
white
basis
question
as
to
emancipation
said
that
distinguished
son
of
your
state
if
ever
that
should
take
place
it
can
not
be
done
by
the
state
it
must
be
done
by
the
union
again
if
emancipation
can
ever
be
effected
it
can
only
be
done
with
the
aid
of
the
general
government
gentlemen
you
are
welcome
to
your
doctrine
it
has
no
advocates
among
the
abolitionists
of
new
england
we
aim
to
overthrow
slavery
by
the
moral
influence
of
an
enlightened
public
sentiment
by
a
clear
and
fearless
exposition
of
the
guilt
of
holding
property
in
man
by
analyzing
the
true
nature
of
slavery
and
boldly
rebuking
sin
by
a
general
dissemination
of
the
truths
of
political
economy
in
regard
to
free
and
slave
labor
by
appeals
from
the
pulpit
to
the
consciences
of
men
by
the
powerful
influence
of
the
public
press
by
the
formation
of
societies
whose
object
shall
be
to
oppose
the
principle
of
slavery
by
such
means
as
are
consistent
with
our
obligations
to
law
religion
and
humanity
by
elevating
by
means
of
education
and
sympathy
the
character
of
the
free
people
of
color
among
us
our
testimony
against
slavery
is
the
same
which
has
uniformly
and
with
so
much
success
been
applied
to
prevailing
iniquity
in
all
ages
of
the
world
the
truths
of
divine
revelation
believing
that
there
can
be
nothing
in
the
providence
of
god
to
which
his
holy
and
eternal
law
is
not
strictly
applicable
we
maintain
that
no
circumstances
can
justify
the
in
a
continuance
of
his
system
that
the
fact
that
this
system
did
not
originate
with
the
present
generation
is
no
apology
for
retaining
it
inasmuch
as
crime
can
not
be
entailed
and
no
one
is
under
a
necessity
of
sinning
because
others
have
done
so
before
him
that
the
domestic
is
as
repugnant
to
the
laws
of
god
and
should
be
as
odious
in
the
eyes
of
a
christian
community
as
the
foreign
that
the
black
child
born
in
a
slave
plantation
is
not
an
entailed
article
of
property
and
that
the
white
man
who
makes
of
that
child
a
slave
is
a
thief
and
a
robber
stealing
the
child
as
the
sea
pirate
stole
his
father
we
do
not
talk
of
gradual
abolition
because
as
christians
we
find
no
authority
for
advocating
a
gradual
relinquishment
of
sin
we
say
to
slaveholders
repent
now
immediately
just
as
we
say
to
the
intemperate
break
off
from
your
vice
at
once
touch
not
taste
not
handle
not
from
henceforth
forever
besides
the
plan
of
gradual
abolition
has
been
tried
in
this
country
and
the
west
indies
and
found
wanting
it
has
been
in
operation
in
our
slave
states
ever
since
the
declaration
of
independence
and
its
results
are
before
the
nation
let
us
see
the
abolitionists
in
there
were
in
the
slave
states
south
of
the
potomac
and
the
ohio
free
blacks
their
increase
for
the
ten
years
following
was
at
the
rate
of
sixty
per
their
number
in
being
in
there
were
an
increase
of
per
cent
this
comparatively
large
increase
was
in
a
great
measure
owing
to
the
free
discussions
going
on
in
england
and
in
this
country
on
the
subject
of
the
and
the
rights
of
man
the
benevolent
impulse
extended
to
the
and
manumissions
were
frequent
but
the
salutary
impression
died
away
the
hand
of
oppression
closed
again
upon
its
victims
and
the
increase
for
the
period
of
twenty
years
to
was
only
per
about
one
half
of
what
it
was
in
the
ten
years
from
to
and
this
is
the
practical
result
of
the
plan
of
gradual
abolition
in
in
the
states
above
mentioned
there
were
only
slaves
but
in
there
were
and
this
too
is
gradual
abolition
what
then
perhaps
you
will
ask
do
you
expect
to
overthrow
our
whole
slave
system
at
once
to
turn
loose
two
millions
of
negroes
no
gentlemen
we
expect
no
such
thing
enough
for
us
if
in
the
spirit
of
fraternal
duty
we
point
to
your
notice
the
commands
of
god
if
we
urge
you
by
every
cherished
remembrance
of
common
sacrifices
upon
a
common
altar
by
every
consideration
of
humanity
justice
and
expediency
to
begin
now
without
a
moment
delay
to
break
away
from
your
miserable
system
to
begin
the
work
of
moral
reformation
as
god
commands
you
to
begin
not
as
selfishness
or
worldly
policy
or
political
expediency
may
chance
to
dictate
such
is
our
doctrine
of
immediate
emancipation
a
doctrine
founded
on
god
eternal
truth
plain
simple
and
perfect
the
doctrine
of
immediate
unprocrastinated
repentance
applied
to
the
sin
of
slavery
of
this
doctrine
and
of
our
plan
for
crrrying
it
into
effect
i
have
given
an
exposition
with
the
most
earnest
regard
to
the
truth
does
either
embrace
anything
false
fanatical
or
unconstitutional
do
they
afford
a
reasonable
protext
for
your
fierce
denunciations
of
your
northern
brethren
do
they
furnish
occasion
for
your
newspaper
chivalry
your
stereotyped
demonstrations
of
southern
magnanimity
and
yankee
meanness
things
let
me
say
unworthy
of
virginians
degrading
to
yourselves
insulting
to
us
gentlemen
it
is
too
late
for
virginia
with
all
her
lofty
intellect
and
nobility
of
feeling
to
defend
and
advocate
the
principle
of
slavery
the
silence
which
for
nearly
two
centuries
brooded
over
her
execrable
system
has
been
broken
light
is
pouring
in
upon
the
minds
of
her
citizens
truth
is
abroad
searching
out
and
overturning
the
lies
of
the
age
a
moral
reformation
has
been
already
awakened
and
it
can
not
now
be
drugged
to
sleep
by
the
sophistries
of
detected
sin
a
thousand
intelligences
are
at
work
in
her
land
a
thousand
of
her
noblest
hearts
are
glowing
with
the
redeeming
spirit
of
that
true
philanthropy
which
is
moving
all
the
world
no
gentlemen
light
is
spreading
from
the
hills
of
western
virginia
to
the
extremest
east
you
can
not
arrest
its
progress
it
is
searching
the
consciences
it
is
exercising
the
reason
it
is
appealing
to
the
noblest
characteristics
of
intelligent
virginians
it
is
no
foreign
influence
from
every
abandoned
plantation
where
the
profitless
fern
and
thistle
have
sprung
up
under
the
heel
of
slavery
from
every
falling
mansion
of
the
master
through
whose
windows
the
fox
may
look
out
securely
and
over
whose
the
thin
grass
is
creeping
a
warning
voice
is
sinking
deeply
into
all
hearts
not
imbruted
by
avarice
indolence
and
the
lust
of
power
abolitionist
as
i
am
the
intellectual
character
of
virginia
has
no
warmer
admirer
than
myself
her
great
names
her
moral
trophies
the
glories
of
her
early
day
the
still
proud
and
living
testimonials
of
her
mental
power
i
freely
acknowledge
and
strongly
appreciate
and
believe
me
it
is
with
no
other
feelings
than
those
of
regret
and
heartfelt
sorrow
that
i
speak
plainly
of
her
great
error
her
giant
crime
a
crime
which
is
visibly
calling
down
upon
her
the
curse
of
an
offended
deity
but
i
can
not
forget
that
upon
some
of
the
most
influential
and
highly
favored
of
her
sons
rests
the
responsibility
at
the
present
time
of
sustaining
this
fearful
iniquity
blind
to
the
signs
of
the
times
careless
of
the
wishes
of
thousands
of
their
white
and
of
the
manifold
wrongs
of
the
black
man
they
have
dared
to
excuse
defend
nay
eulogize
the
black
abominations
of
slavery
against
the
tottering
ark
of
the
idol
these
strong
men
have
placed
their
shoulders
that
ark
must
fall
that
idol
must
be
cast
down
what
then
will
be
the
fate
of
their
supporters
when
the
convention
of
had
gathered
in
its
splendid
galaxy
of
talents
the
great
names
of
virginia
the
friends
of
civil
liberty
turned
their
eyes
towards
it
in
the
earnest
hope
and
confidence
that
it
would
adopt
some
measures
in
regard
to
slavery
worthy
of
the
high
character
of
its
members
and
of
the
age
in
which
they
lived
i
need
not
say
how
deep
and
bitter
was
our
disappointment
western
virginia
indeed
spoke
on
that
occasion
through
some
of
her
delegates
the
words
of
truth
and
humanity
but
their
counsels
and
warnings
were
unavailing
the
majority
turned
away
to
listen
to
the
bewildering
eloquence
of
leigh
and
upshur
and
randolph
as
they
desecrated
their
great
intellects
to
the
defence
of
that
system
of
oppression
under
which
the
whole
land
is
groaning
the
memorial
of
the
citizens
of
augusta
county
bearing
the
signatures
of
many
holders
placed
the
evils
of
slavery
in
a
strong
light
before
the
convention
its
facts
and
arguments
could
only
be
arbitrarily
thrust
aside
and
wantonly
disregarded
they
could
not
be
disproved
in
a
political
point
of
view
says
the
memorial
we
esteem
slavery
an
evil
greater
than
the
aggregate
of
all
the
other
evils
which
beset
us
and
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
bear
our
proportion
of
the
burden
of
removing
it
we
ask
further
what
is
the
evil
of
any
such
alarm
as
our
proposition
may
excite
in
minds
unnecessarily
jealous
compared
with
that
of
the
fatal
catastrophe
which
ultimately
awaits
our
country
and
the
general
depravation
of
manners
which
slavery
has
already
produced
and
is
producing
i
can
not
forbear
giving
one
more
extract
from
this
paper
the
memorialists
state
their
belief
that
the
labor
of
slaves
is
vastly
less
productive
than
that
of
freemen
that
it
therefore
requires
a
larger
space
to
furnish
subsistence
for
a
given
number
of
the
former
than
of
the
latter
that
the
employment
of
the
former
necessarily
excludes
that
of
the
latter
that
hence
our
population
white
and
black
averages
seventeen
when
it
ought
and
would
under
other
circumstances
average
as
in
new
england
at
least
sixty
to
a
square
mile
that
the
possession
and
management
of
slaves
form
a
source
of
endless
vexation
and
misery
in
the
house
and
of
waste
and
ruin
on
the
farm
that
the
youth
of
the
country
are
growing
up
with
a
contempt
of
steady
industry
as
a
low
and
servile
thing
which
contempt
induces
idleness
and
all
its
attendant
effeminacy
vice
and
worthlessness
that
the
waste
of
the
products
of
the
land
nay
of
the
land
itself
is
bringing
poverty
on
all
its
inhabitants
that
this
poverty
and
the
sparseness
of
population
either
prevent
the
institution
of
schools
throughout
the
country
or
keep
them
in
a
most
languid
and
inefficient
condition
and
that
the
same
causes
most
obviously
paralyze
all
our
schemes
and
efforts
for
the
useful
improvement
of
the
country
gentlemen
you
have
only
to
look
around
you
to
know
that
this
picture
has
been
drawn
with
the
pencil
of
truth
what
has
made
desolate
and
sterile
one
of
the
loveliest
regions
of
the
whole
earth
what
mean
the
signs
of
wasteful
neglect
of
long
improvidence
around
you
the
mansion
already
falling
into
decay
the
enclosures
the
grown
garden
the
slave
hut
open
to
the
elements
the
hillsides
galled
and
naked
the
fields
below
them
run
over
with
brier
and
fern
is
all
this
in
the
ordinary
course
of
nature
has
man
husbanded
well
the
good
gifts
of
god
and
are
they
nevertheless
passing
from
him
by
a
process
of
deterioration
over
which
he
has
no
control
no
gentlemen
for
more
than
two
centuries
the
cold
and
rocky
soil
of
new
england
has
yielded
its
annual
tribute
and
it
still
lies
green
and
luxuriant
beneath
the
sun
of
our
brief
summer
the
nerved
and
arm
of
free
labor
has
changed
a
landscape
wild
and
savage
as
the
night
scenery
of
salvator
rosa
into
one
of
pastoral
beauty
the
abode
of
independence
and
happiness
under
a
similar
system
of
economy
and

how
would
virginia
rich
with
nature
prodigal
blessings
have
worn
at
this
time
over
all
her

the
smiles
of

the

a

member

described
the
virginia
holder
as
follows
he
is
an
eastern
virginian
whose
good
fortune
it
has
been
to
have
been
born
wealthy
and
to
have
become
a
profound
politician
at
without
study
or
labor
this
individual
from
birth
and
habit
is
above
all
labor
and
exertion
he
never
moves
a
finger
for
any
useful
purpose
he
lives
on
the
labor
of
his
slaves
and
even
this
labor
he
is
too
proud
and
indolent
to
direct
in
person
while
he
is
at
his
ease
a
mercenary
with
a
whip
in
his
hand
drives
his
slaves
in
the
field
their
dinner
consisting
of

it
aside

you

for

speculations
you
might
successfully
meet
the
dangerous
exigencies
of
your
state
with
those
efficient
remedies
which
the
spirit
of
the
age
suggests
you
might
and
that
too
without
pecuniary
loss
relinquish
your
claims
to
human
beings
as
slaves
and
employ
them
as
free
laborers
under
such
restraint

supervision
as
their

to
his

in
the
last
hour
of

when
his
soul
was

gentlemen
in

let
me
once
more
assure
you
that
i
entertain
towards
you
and
your
political

none
other
than
kindly
feelings
if
i
have
spoken
at
all
with
apparent
harshness
it
has
been
of
principles
rather
than
of
men
but
i
deprecate
no
censure
conscious
of
the
honest
and
patriotic
motives
which
have
prompted
their
avowal
i
cheerfully
leave
my
sentiments
to
their
fate
despised
and
contemned
as
they
may
be
i
believe
they
can
not
be
gainsaid
sustained
by
the
truth
as
it
exists
in
nature
and
revelation
sanctioned
by
the
prevailing
spirit
of
the

they
are

destined

out
the

of

believe
that
though
all
the
winds
of

let
loose

so
truth
be

we
need
not

dear
friend
i
regret
that
circumstances
beyond
my
control
will
not
allow
of
my
attendance
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
new
england
slavery
society
i
need
not
say
to
the
members
of
that
society
that
i
am
with
them
heart
and
soul
in
the
cause
of
abolition
the
abolition
not
of
physical
slavery
alone
abhorrent
and
monstrous
as
it
is
but
of
that
intellectual
slavery
the
bondage
of
corrupt
and
mistaken
opinion
which
has
fettered
as
with
iron
the
moral
energies
and
intellectual
strength
of
new
england
for
what
is
slavery
after
all
but
fear
fear
forcing
mind
and
body
into
unnatural
action
and
it
matters
little
whether
it
be
the
terror
of
the
on
the
body
or
of
the
scourge
of
popular
opinion
upon
the
inner
man
we
all
know
how
often
the
representatives
of
the
southern
division
of
the
country
have
amused
themselves
in
congress
by
applying
the
opprobrious
name
of
slave
to
the
free
northern
laborer
and
how
familiar
have
the
significant
epithets
of
white
slave
and
become
i
fear
these
epithets
have
not
been
wholly
misapplied
have
we
not
been
told
here
gravely
and
authoritatively
by
some
of
our
learned
judges
divines
and
politicians
that
we
the
free
people
of
new
england
have
no
right
to
discuss
the
subject
of
slavery
freemen
and
no
right
to
suggest
the
duty
or
the
policy
of
a
practical
adherence
to
the
doctrines
of
that
immortal
declaration
upon
which
our
liberties
are
founded
christians
enjoying
perfect
liberty
of
conscience
yet
possessing
no
right
to
breathe
one
whisper
against
a
system
of
adultery
and
blood
which
is
filling
the
whole
land
with
abomination
and
blasphemy
and
this
craven
sentiment
is
echoed
by
the
very
men
whose
industry
is
taxed
to
defray
the
expenses
of
representatives
of
property
vested
in
beings
fashioned
in
the
awful
image
of
their
maker
by
men
whose
hard
earnings
aid
in
supporting
a
standing
army
mainly
for
the
protection
of
slaveholding
indolence
by
men
who
are
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
called
from
the
field
and
workshop
to
put
down
by
force
the
ever
upward
tendencies
of
oppressed
humanity
to
aid
the
and
the
trader
in
the
prosecution
of
a
traffic
most
horrible
in
the
eye
of
god
to
wall
round
with
their
bayonets
two
millions
of
colored
americans
children
of
a
common
father
and
heirs
of
a
common
eternity
while
the
broken
chain
is
riveted
anew
and
the
fetter
replaced
i
am
for
the
abolition
of
this
kind
of
slavery
it
must
be
accomplished
before
we
can
hope
to
abolish
the
negro
slavery
of
the
country
the
people
of
the
free
states
with
a
perfect
understanding
of
their
own
rights
and
a
sacred
respect
for
the
rights
of
others
must
put
their
strong
shoulders
to
the
work
of
moral
reform
and
our
statesmen
orators
and
politicians
will
follow
floating
as
they
must
with
the
tendency
of
the
current
the
mere
indices
of
popular
sentiment
they
can
not
be
expected
to
lead
in
this
matter
they
are
but
instruments
in
the
hands
of
the
people
for
good
or
evil
a
breath
can
make
them
as
a
breath
has
made
be
it
our
task
to
give
tone
and
direction
to
these
instruments
to
turn
the
tide
of
popular
feeling
into
the
pure
channels
of
justice
to
break
up
the
sinful
silence
of
the
nation
to
bring
the
vaunted
christianity
of
our
age
and
country
to
the
test
of
truth
to
try
the
strength
and
purity
of
our
republicanism
if
the
christianity
we
profess
has
not
power
to
pull
down
the
strongholds
of
prejudice
and
overcome
hate
and
melt
the
heart
of
oppression
it
is
not
of
god
if
our
republicanism
is
based
on
other
foundation
than
justice
and
humanity
let
it
fall
forever
no
better
evidence
is
needed
of
the
suicidal
policy
of
this
nation
than
the
silence
on
the
subject
of
slavery
which
pervades
its
public
documents
who
that
peruses
the
annual
messages
of
the
national
executive
would
from
their
perusal
alone
conjecture
that
such
an
evil
as
slavery
had
existence
among
us
have
the
people
reflected
upon
the
cause
of
this
silence
the
evil
has
grown
to
be
too
monstrous
to
be
questioned
its
very
magnitude
has
sealed
the
lips
of
the
rulers
uneasily
and
troubled
with
its
dream
of
guilt
the
nation
sleeps
on
the
volcano
is
beneath
god
is
above
us
at
every
step
of
our
peaceful
and
legal
agitation
of
this
subject
we
are
met
with
one
grave
objection
we
are
told
that
the
system
which
we
are
conscientiously
opposing
is
recognized
and
protected
by
the
constitution
for
all
the
benefits
of
our
fathers
patriotism
and
they
are
neither
few
nor
trifling
let
us
be
grateful
to
god
and
to
their
memories
but
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
the
same
constitutional
compact
which
now
sanctions
slavery
guaranteed
protection
for
twenty
years
to
the
foreign
it
threw
the
shield
of
its
sanctity
around
the
now
universally
branded
pirate
it
legalized
the
most
abhorrent
system
of
robbery
which
ever
cursed
the
family
of
man
during
those
years
of
sinful
compromise
the
crime
of
less
atrocious
than
at
present
because
the
constitution
permitted
in
that
single
crime
the
violation
of
all
the
commandments
of
god
was
that
violation
less
terrible
to
earth
or
offensive
to
heaven
no
one
now
defends
that
constitutional
slavetrade
loaded
with
the
curse
of
god
and
man
it
stands
amidst
minor
iniquities
like
satan
in
pandemonium
preeminent
and
monstrous
in
crime
and
if
the
has
become
thus
odious
what
must
be
the
fate
erelong
of
its
parent
slavery
if
the
mere
consequence
be
thus
blackening
under
the
execration
of
all
the
world
who
shall
measure
the
dreadful
amount
of
infamy
which
must
finally
settle
on
the
cause
itself
the
titled
ecclesiastic
and
the
ambitious
statesman
should
have
their
warning
on
this
point
they
should
know
that
public
opinion
is
steadily
turning
to
the
light
of
truth
the
fountains
are
breaking
up
around
us
and
the
great
deep
will
soon
be
in
motion
a
stern
uncompromising
and
solemn
spirit
of
inquiry
is
abroad
it
can
not
be
arrested
and
its
result
may
be
easily
foreseen
it
will
not
long
be
popular
to
talk
of
the
legality
of
the
constitutionality
of
one
word
in
relation
to
our
duty
to
our
southern
brethren
if
we
detest
their
system
of
slavery
in
our
hearts
let
us
not
play
the
hypocrite
with
our
lips
let
us
not
pay
so
poor
a
compliment
to
their
understandings
as
to
suppose
that
we
can
deceive
them
into
a
compliance
with
our
views
of
justice
by
ambiguous
sophistry
and
overcome
their
sinful
practices
and
established
prejudices
by
miserable
stratagem
let
us
not
first
do
violence
to
our
consciences
by
admitting
their
moral
right
to
property
in
man
and
then
go
to
work
like
so
many
vagabond
pedlers
to
cheat
them
out
of
it
they
have
a
right
to
complain
of
such
treatment
it
is
mean
and
wicked
and
dishonorable
let
us
rather
treat
our
southern
friends
as
intelligent
and
men
who
whatever
may
be
their
faults
despise
unmanly
artifice
and
loathe
cant
and
abhor
hypocrisy
connected
with
them
not
by
political
ties
alone
but
by
common
sacrifices
and
mutual
benefits
let
us
seek
to
expostulate
with
them
earnestly
and
openly
to
gain
at
least
their
confidence
in
our
sincerity
to
appeal
to
their
consciences
reason
and
interests
and
using
no
other
weapons
than
those
of
moral
truth
contend
fearlessly
with
the
evil
system
they
are
cherishing
and
if
in
an
immediate
compliance
with
the
strict
demands
of
justice
they
should
need
our
aid
and
sympathy
let
us
open
to
them
our
hearts
and
our
purses
but
in
the
name
of
sincerity
and
for
the
love
of
peace
and
the
harmony
of
the
union
let
there
be
no
more
mining
and
countermining
no
more
blending
of
apology
with
denunciation
no
more
systems
of
reform
with
one
face
for
the
south
and
another
for
the
north
if
we
steadily
adhere
to
the
principles
upon
which
we
have
heretofore
acted
if
we
present
our
naked
hearts
to
the
view
of
all
if
we
meet
the
threats
and
violence
of
our
misguided
enemies
with
the
bare
bosom
and
weaponless
hand
of
innocence
may
we
not
trust
that
the
arm
of
our
heavenly
father
will
be
under
us
to
strengthen
and
support
us
and
although
we
may
not
be
able
to
save
our
country
from
the
awful
judgment
she
is
provoking
though
the
pillars
of
the
union
fall
and
all
the
elements
of
her
greatness
perish
still
let
it
be
our
part
to
rally
around
the
standard
of
truth
and
justice
to
wash
our
hands
of
evil
to
keep
our
own
souls
unspotted
and
bearing
our
testimony
and
lifting
our
warning
voices
to
the
last

of

district
in

to
which
is
added
his
speech
in
congress
delivered
february
and
the
following
stood
as
an
introduction
to
the
pamphlet
the
following
letters
have
been
published
within
a
few
weeks
in
the
quincy
mass
notwithstanding
the
great
importance
of
the
subjects
which
they
discuss
the
intense
interest
which
they
are
calculated
to
awaken
throughout
this
commonwealth
and
the
whole
country
and
the
exalted
reputation
of
their
author
as
a
profound
statesman
and
powerful
writer
they
are
as
yet
hardly
known
beyond
the
limits
of
the
constituency
to
whom
they
are
particularly
addressed
the
reason
of
this
is
sufficiently
obvious
john
quincy
adams
belongs
to
neither
of
the
prominent
political
parties
fights
no
partisan
battles
and
can
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
sacrifice
truth
and
principle
upon
the
altar
of
party
expediency
and
interest
hence
neither
party
is
interested
in
defending
his
course
or
in
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
defend
himself
but
however
systematic
may
be
the
efforts
of
mere
partisan
presses
to
suppress
and
hold
back
from
the
public
eye
the
powerful
and
triumphant
vindication
of
the
right
of
petition
the
graphic
delineation
of
the
slavery
spirit
in
congress
and
the
humbling
disclosure
of
northern
cowardice
and
treachery
contained
in
these
letters
they
are
destined
to
exert
a
powerful
influence
upon
the
public
mind
they
will
constitute
one
of
the
most
striking
pages
in
the
history
of
our
times
they
will
be
read
with
avidity
in
the
north
and
in
the
south
and
throughout
europe
apart
from
the
interest
excited
by
the
subjects
under
discussion
and
viewed
only
as
literary
productions
they
may
be
ranked
among
the
highest
intellectual
efforts
of
their
author
their
sarcasm
is
cold
keen
unsparing
in
boldness
directness
and
eloquent
appeal
they
will
bear
comparison
with
celebrated
to
the
reformers
of
great
britain
they
are
the
offspring
of
an
intellect
unshorn
of
its
primal
strength
and
combining
the
ardor
of
youth
with
the
experience
of
age
the
disclosure
made
in
these
letters
of
the
slavery
influence
exerted
in
congress
over
the
representatives
of
the
free
states
of
the
manner
in
which
the
rights
of
freemen
have
been
bartered
for
southern
votes
or
basely
yielded
to
the
threats
of
men
educated
in
despotism
and
stamped
by
the
free
indulgence
of
unrestrained
tyranny
with
the
odious
peculiarities
of
slavery
is
painful
and
humiliating
in
the
extreme
it
will
be
seen
that
in
the
great
struggle
for
and
against
the
right
of
petition
an
account
of
which
is
given
in
the
following
pages
their
author
stood
in
a
great
measure
alone
and
unsupported
by
his
northern
colleagues
on
his
gray
discrowned
head
the
entire
fury
of
holding
arrogance
and
wrath
was
expended
he
stood
alone
beating
back
with
his
aged
and
single
arm
the
tide
which
would
have
borne
down
and
overwhelmed
a
less
sturdy
and
determined
spirit
we
need
not
solicit
for
these
letters
and
the
speech
which
accompanies
them
a
thorough
perusal
they
deserve
and
we
trust
will
receive
a
circulation
throughout
the
entire
country
they
will
meet
a
cordial
welcome
from
every
lover
of
human
liberty
from
every
friend
of
justice
and
the
rights
of
man
irrespective
of
color
or
condition
the
principles
which
they
defend
the
sentiments
which
they
express
are
those
of
massachusetts
as
recently
asserted
almost
unanimously
by
her
legislature
in
both
branches
of
that
body
during
the
discussion
of
the
subject
of
slavery
and
the
right
of
petition
the
course
of
the
president
was
warmly
and
eloquently
commended
massachusetts
will
sustain
her
tried
and
faithful
representative
and
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
the
best
and
worthiest
citizens
of
the
entire
north
will
proffer
him
their
thanks
for
his
noble
defence
of
their
rights
as
freemen
and
of
the
rights
of
the
slave
as
a
man
the
bible
and
slavery
from
a
review
of
a
pamphlet
by
evangelicus
in
the
boston
emancipator
in
the
second
part
of
the
essay
is
occupied
in
proving
that
the
slavery
in
the
roman
world
at
the
time
of
our
saviour
was
similar
in
all
essential
features
to
american
slavery
at
the
present
day
and
the
third
and
concluding
part
is
devoted
to
an
examination
of
the
apostolical
directions
to
slaves
and
masters
as
applicable
to
the
same
classes
in
the
united
states
he
thinks
the
command
to
give
to
servants
that
which
is
just
and
equal
means
simply
that
the
masters
should
treat
their
slaves
with
equity
and
that
while
the
servant
is
to
be
profitable
to
the
master
the
latter
is
bound
in
a
fair
and
equitable
manner
to
provide
for
the
slave
subsistence
and
happiness
although
he
professes
to
believe
that
a
faithful
adherence
to
scriptural
injunctions
on
this
point
would
eventually
terminate
in
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
he
thinks
it
not
necessary
to
inquire
whether
the
new
testament
does
or
does
not
tolerate
slavery
as
a
permanent
institution
from
the
foregoing
synopsis
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
motives
of
the
writer
the
effect
of
his
publication
so
far
as
it
is
at
all
felt
will
be
to
strengthen
the
oppressor
in
his
guilt
and
hold
him
back
from
the
performance
of
his
immediate
duty
in
respect
to
his
slaves
and
to
shield
his
conscience
from
the
reproofs
of
that
class
who
according
to
evangelicus
have
no
personal
acquaintance
with
the
actual
domestic
state
or
the
social
and
political
connections
of
their
southern
we
look
upon
it
only
as
another
vain
attempt
to
strike
a
balance
between
christian
duty
and
criminal
policy
to
reconcile
christ
and
belial
the
holy
philanthropy
of
him
who
went
about
doing
good
with
the
most
abhorrent
manifestation
of
human
selfishness
lust
and
hatred
which
ever
provoked
the
divine
displeasure
there
is
a
coldness
about
it
the
author
manifests
as
little
feeling
as
if
he
were
solving
a
question
in
algebra
no
sigh
of
sympathy
breathes
through
its
frozen
pages
for
the
dumb
chained
millions
no
evidence
of
a
feeling
akin
to
that
of
him
who
at
the
grave
of
lazarus
wept
and
forgot
his
power
to
save
no
outburst
of
that
indignant
reproof
with
which
the
divine
master
rebuked
the
devourers
of
widows
houses
and
the
oppressors
of
the
poor
is
called
forth
by
the
writer
stoical
contemplation
of
the
tyranny
of
his
christian
brethren
at
the
south
it
is
not
necessary
says
evangelicus
to
inquire
whether
the
new
testament
does
not
tolerate
slavery
as
a
permanent
institution
and
this
is
said
when
the
entire
church
has
sheltered
its
abominations
under
the
pretended
sanction
of
the
gospel
when
slavery
including
within
itself
a
violation
of
every
command
uttered
amidst
the
thunders
of
sinai
a
system
which
has
filled
the
whole
south
with
the
oppression
of
egypt
and
the
pollutions
of
sodom
is
declared
to
be
an
institution
of
the
most
high
with
all
due
deference
to
the
author
we
tell
him
and
we
tell
the
church
north
and
south
that
this
question
must
be
met
once
more
we
repeat
the
solemn
inquiry
which
has
been
already
made
in
our
columns
is
the
bible
to
enslave
the
world
has
it
been
but
a
vain
dream
of
ours
that
the
mission
of
the
author
of
the
gospel
was
to
undo
the
heavy
burdens
to
open
the
prison
doors
and
to
break
the
yoke
of
the
captive
let
andover
and
princeton
answer
if
the
gospel
does
sanction
the
vilest
wrong
which
man
can
inflict
upon
his
if
it
does
rivet
the
chains
which
humanity
left
to
itself
would
otherwise
cast
off
then
in
humanity
name
let
it
perish
forever
from
the
face
of
the
earth
let
the
bible
societies
dissolve
let
not
another
sheet
issue
from
their
presses
scatter
not
its
leaves
abroad
over
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
they
are
not
for
the
healing
of
the
nations
leave
rather
to
the
persian
his
zendavesta
to
the
mussulman
his
koran
we
repeat
it
this
question
must
be
met
already
we
have
heard
infidelity
exulting
over
the
astute
discoveries
of
bespectacled
theological
professors
that
the
great
head
of
the
christian
church
tolerated
the
horrible
atrocities
of
roman
slavery
and
that
his
most
favored
apostle
combined
with
his
missionary
labors
and
why
should
it
not
exult
fouler
blasphemy
than
this
was
never
uttered
a
more
monstrous
libel
upon
the
divine
author
of
christianity
was
never
propagated
by
paine
or
voltaire
kneeland
or
owen
and
we
are
constrained
to
regard
the
professor
of
theology
or
the
doctor
of
divinity
who
tasks
his
sophistry
and
learning
in
an
attempt
to
show
that
the
divine
mind
looks
with
complacency
upon
chattel
slavery
as
the
most
dangerous
enemy
with
which
christianity
has
to
contend
the
friends
of
pure
and
undefiled
religion
must
awake
to
this
danger
the
northern
church
must
shake
itself
clean
from
its
present
connection
with
blasphemers
and
or
perish
with
them
what
is
slavery
addressed
to
the
liberty
party
convention
at
new
bedford
in
september
i
have
just
received
your
kind
invitation
to
attend
the
meeting
of
the
liberty
party
in
new
bedford
on
the
of
next
month
believe
me
it
is
with
no
ordinary
feelings
of
regret
that
i
find
myself
under
the
necessity
of
foregoing
the
pleasure
of
meeting
with
you
on
that
occasion
but
i
need
not
say
to
you
and
through
you
to
the
convention
that
you
have
my
hearty
sympathy
i
am
with
the
liberty
party
because
it
is
the
only
party
in
the
country
which
is
striving
openly
and
honestly
to
reduce
to
practice
the
great
truths
which
lie
at
the
foundation
of
our
republic
all
men
created
equal
endowed
with
rights
inalienable
the
security
of
these
rights
the
only
just
object
of
government
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
modify
government
until
this
great
object
is
attained
precious
and
glorious
truths
sacred
in
the
sight
of
their
divine
author
grateful
and
beneficent
to
suffering
humanity
essential
elements
of
that
ultimate
and
universal
government
of
which
god
is
laying
the
strong
and
wide
foundations
turning
and
overturning
until
he
whose
right
it
is
shall
rule
the
voice
which
calls
upon
us
to
sustain
them
is
the
voice
of
god
in
the
eloquent
language
of
the
lamented
myron
holley
the
man
who
first
lifted
up
the
standard
of
the
liberty
party
he
calls
upon
us
to
sustain
these
truths
in
the
recorded
voice
of
the
holy
of
ancient
times
he
calls
us
to
sustain
them
in
the
sound
as
of
many
waters
and
mighty
thunderings
rising
from
the
fields
of
europe
converted
into
one
vast
aceldama
by
the
exertions
of
despots
to
suppress
them
in
the
persuasive
history
of
the
best
thoughts
and
boldest
deeds
of
all
our
brave
sacrificing
ancestors
in
the
tender
whispers
of
our
children
preparing
to
suffer
or
enjoy
the
future
as
we
leave
it
for
them
in
the
broken
and
disordered
but
moving
accents
of
half
our
race
yet
groping
in
darkness
and
galled
by
the
chains
of
bondage
he
calls
upon
us
to
sustain
them
by
the
solemn
and
considerate
use
of
all
the
powers
with
which
he
has
invested
us
in
a
time
of
almost
universal
political
scepticism
in
the
midst
of
a
pervading
and
growing
unbelief
in
the
great
principles
enunciated
in
the
revolutionary
declaration
the
liberty
party
has
dared
to
avow
its
belief
in
these
truths
and
to
carry
them
into
action
as
far
as
it
has
the
power
it
is
a
protest
against
the
political
infidelity
of
the
day
a
recurrence
to
first
principles
a
summons
once
more
to
that
deserted
altar
upon
which
our
fathers
laid
their
offerings
it
may
be
asked
why
it
is
that
a
party
resting
upon
such
broad
principles
is
directing
its
exclusive
exertions
against
slavery
are
there
not
other
great
interests
ask
all
manner
of
whig
and
democrat
editors
and
politicians
consider
for
instance
say
the
democrats
the
mighty
question
which
is
agitating
us
whether
a
man
with
southern
principles
or
a
southern
man
with
the
principles
of
a
nero
or
caligula
shall
be
president
or
look
at
us
say
the
whigs
deprived
of
our
inalienable
right
to
office
by
this
administration
and
bethink
you
gentlemen
how
could
your
liberty
party
do
better
than
to
vote
with
us
for
a
man
who
if
he
does
hold
some
threescore
of
slaves
and
maintain
that
hundred
years
of
legislation
has
sanctioned
and
sanctified
negro
slavery
is
at
the
same
time
the
champion
of
greek
liberty
and
polish
liberty
and
south
american
liberty
and
in
short
of
all
sorts
of
liberties
save
liberty
at
home
yes
friends
we
have
considered
all
this
and
more
namely
that
one
sixth
part
of
our
entire
population
are
slaves
and
that
you
with
your
subtreasuries
and
national
banks
propose
no
relief
for
them
nay
farther
it
is
because
both
of
you
when
in
power
have
used
your
authority
to
rivet
closer
the
chains
of
unhappy
millions
that
we
have
been
compelled
to
abandon
you
and
form
a
liberty
party
having
for
its
first
object
the
breaking
of
these
chains
what
is
slavery
for
upon
the
answer
to
this
question
must
the
liberty
party
depend
for
its
justification
the
slave
laws
of
the
south
tell
us
that
it
is
the
conversion
of
men
into
articles
of
property
the
transformation
of
sentient
immortal
beings
into
chattels
personal
the
principle
of
a
reciprocity
of
benefits
which
to
some
extent
characterizes
all
other
relations
does
not
exist
in
that
of
master
and
slave
the
master
holds
the
plough
which
turns
the
soil
of
his
plantation
the
horse
which
draws
it
and
the
slave
who
guides
it
by
one
and
the
same
tenure
the
profit
of
the
master
is
the
great
end
of
the
slave
existence
for
this
end
he
is
fed
clothed
and
prescribed
for
in
sickness
he
learns
nothing
acquires
nothing
for
himself
he
can
not
use
his
own
body
for
his
own
benefit
his
very
personality
is
destroyed
he
is
a
mere
instrument
a
means
in
the
hands
of
another
for
the
accomplishment
of
an
end
in
which
his
own
interests
are
not
regarded
a
machine
moved
not
by
his
own
will
but
by
another
in
him
the
awful
distinction
between
a
person
and
a
thing
is
annihilated
he
is
thrust
down
from
the
place
which
god
and
nature
assigned
him
from
the
equal
companionship
of
rational
intelligence
a
man
herded
with
beasts
an
immortal
nature
classed
with
the
wares
of
the
merchant
the
relations
of
parent
and
child
master
and
apprentice
government
and
subject
are
based
upon
the
principle
of
benevolence
reciprocal
benefits
and
the
wants
of
human
society
relations
which
sacredly
respect
the
rights
and
legacies
which
god
has
given
to
all
his
rational
creatures
but
slavery
exists
only
by
annihilating
or
monopolizing
these
rights
and
legacies
in
every
other
modification
of
society
personal
ownership
remains
secure
he
may
be
oppressed
deprived
of
privileges
loaded
with
burdens
hemmed
about
with
legal
disabilities
his
liberties
restrained
but
through
all
the
right
to
his
own
body
and
soul
remains
inviolate
he
retains
his
inherent
original
possession
of
himself
even
crime
can
not
forfeit
it
for
that
law
which
destroys
his
personality
makes
void
its
own
claims
upon
him
as
a
moral
agent
and
the
power
to
punish
ceases
with
the
accountability
of
the
criminal
he
may
suffer
and
die
under
the
penalties
of
the
law
but
he
suffers
as
a
man
he
perishes
as
a
man
and
not
as
a
thing
to
the
last
moments
of
his
existence
the
rights
of
a
moral
agent
are
his
they
go
with
him
to
the
grave
they
constitute
the
ground
of
his
accountability
at
the
bar
of
infinite
justice
rights
fixed
eternal
inseparable
attributes
of
all
rational
intelligence
in
time
and
eternity
the
same
in
essence
and
differing
in
degree
only
with
those
of
the
highest
moral
being
of
god
himself
slavery
alone
lays
its
grasp
upon
the
right
of
personal
ownership
that
foundation
right
the
removal
of
which
uncreates
the
man
a
right
which
god
himself
could
not
take
away
without
absolving
the
being
thus
deprived
of
all
moral
accountability
and
so
far
as
that
being
is
concerned
making
sin
and
holiness
crime
and
virtue
words
without
significance
and
the
promises
and
sanctions
of
revelation
dreams
hence
the
crowning
horror
of
slavery
that
which
lifts
it
above
all
other
iniquities
is
not
that
it
usurps
the
prerogatives
of
deity
but
that
it
attempts
that
which
even
he
who
has
said
all
souls
are
mine
can
not
do
without
breaking
up
the
foundations
of
his
moral
government
slavery
is
in
fact
a
struggle
with
the
almighty
for
dominion
over
his
rational
creatures
it
is
leagued
with
the
powers
of
darkness
in
wresting
man
from
his
maker
it
is
blasphemy
lifting
brazen
brow
and
violent
hand
to
heaven
attempting
a
reversal
of
god
laws
man
claiming
the
right
to
uncreate
his
brother
to
undo
that
last
and
most
glorious
work
which
god
himself
pronounced
good
amidst
the
rejoicing
hosts
of
heaven
man
arrogating
to
himself
the
right
to
change
for
his
own
selfish
purposes
the
beautiful
order
of
created
existences
to
pluck
the
crown
of
an
immortal
nature
scarce
lower
than
that
of
angels
from
the
brow
of
his
brother
to
erase
the
image
and
superscription
stamped
upon
him
by
the
hand
of
his
creator
and
to
write
on
the
despoiled
and
desecrated
tablet
a
chattel

this
then
is

with
her
thousand
voices

out
against
it
against
it

its
thunders
the
voice
of

it
in
the
deep
places
of
the
human
heart
the
woes
and
wrongs
unutterable
which
attend
this
dreadful
violation
of
natural

abrogated

legalized

the
burial

but
the
mere
incidentals
of
the
first
grand
outrage
that
seizure
of
the
entire
man

which
robs
him

these
are
but

natural

outward
demonstrations
of
slavery
the
crystallizations
from

chattel
principle
it
is
against
this
system
in
its
active
operation
upon
three
millions
of
our
countrymen
that
the
liberty
party
is
for
the
present
directing

its
efforts

such
an
object
well
may
we
be
men
of
one
idea
nor
do
we
neglect
other
great
interests
for
all

colored
and
controlled
by
slavery
and
the
removal
of
this
disastrous
influence
would
most
effectually
benefit
them

the
result

decided
action
follow
our
deep
convictions
of
the
wrong
of
slavery
shall
we
denounce
the
of
the
states
while
we
retain
our
slavery
in
the
district

columbia
shall
we
pray
that

will
turn
the
hearts

us
from

hypocrisy
everybody
now
professes
to
be
opposed

the
leaders
of

two
great
political
parties

grievously
concerned

antislavery
enterprise

will
join
us
in
denouncing
slavery
in
the
abstract
not
a
faithless
priest

politician
will
oppose
us
abandon
action
and
forsooth
we
can
have
an

the
wolf
shall
lie
down
with
the
lamb
while
slavery
in
practice
clanks
in
derision
its
three
millions
of
unbroken
chains
our
opponents
have
no
fear
of
the
harmless
spectre
of
an
abstract
idea
they
dread
it
only
when
it
puts
on
the
flesh

lifts
its

in

which
god

then
we

not

leave
these

we
need
no

the

remember
with
hearty

that

let

blot
out
the

discouragement
from
the
vocabulary
let
the

be

let

despair

let
those
who
grapple
with
wrong
and
falsehood
in
the

and
in

his

take

slavery
must
die
the

spoken
it
the

hot
displeasure

those
which
chastised

in

above

of
cruelty
it
can
no

be
borne
with

universal

cries
out
against
it

work

to
hasten
its
downfall
doing
whatsoever

october
democracy
and
slavery
the
great
leader
of
american
democracy
thomas
jefferson
was
an
abolitionist
in
theory
while
from
youth
to
age
a
in
practice
with
a
zeal
which
never
abated
with
a
warmth
which
the
frost
of
years
could
not
chill
he
urged
the
great
truths
that
each
man
should
be
the
guardian
of
his
own
weal
that
one
man
should
never
have
absolute
control
over
another
he
maintained
the
entire
equality
of
the
race
the
inherent
right
of
the
equal
claim
of
all
to
a
fair
participation
in
the
enactment
of
the
laws
by
which
they
are
governed
he
saw
clearly
that
slavery
as
it
existed
in
the
south
and
on
his
own
plantation
was
inconsistent
with
this
doctrine
his
early
efforts
for
emancipation
in
virginia
failed
of
success
but
he
next
turned
his
attention
to
the
vast
northwestern
territory
and
laid
the
foundation
of
that
ordinance
of
which
like
the
flaming
sword
of
the
angel
at
the
gates
of
paradise
has
effectually
guarded
that
territory
against
the
entrance
of
slavery
nor
did
he
stop
here
he
was
the
friend
and
admirer
of
the
of
revolutionary
france
he
warmly
urged
his
british
friend
price
to
send
his
pamphlets
into
virginia
he
omitted
no
opportunity
to
protest
against
slavery
as
unjust
and
dangerous
to
the
common
welfare
and
in
his
letter
to
the
territorial
governor
of
illinois
written
in
old
age
he
bequeathed
in
earnest
and
affecting
language
the
cause
of
negro
emancipation
to
the
rising
generation
this
enterprise
said
he
is
for
the
young
for
those
who
can
carry
it
forward
to
its
consummation
it
shall
have
all
my
prayers
and
these
are
the
only
weapons
of
an
old
man
such
was
thomas
jefferson
the
great
founder
of
american
democracy
the
advocate
of
the
equality
of
human
rights
irrespective
of
any
conditions
of
birth
or
climate
or
color
his
political
doctrines
it
is
strange
to
say
found
their
earliest
recipients
and
most
zealous
admirers
in
the
slave
states
of
the
union
the
privileged
class
of
slaveholders
whose
rank
and
station
supersede
the
necessity
of
an
order
of
nobility
became
earnest
advocates
of
equality
among
themselves
the
democracy
of
aristocracy
with
the
misery
and
degradation
of
servitude
always
before
them
in
the
condition
of
their
own
slaves
an
intense
love
of
personal
independence
and
a
haughty
impatience
of
any
control
over
their
actions
prepared
them
to
adopt
the
democratic
idea
so
far
as
it
might
be
applied
to
their
own
order
of
that
enlarged
and
generous
democracy
the
love
not
of
individual
freedom
alone
but
of
the
rights
and
liberties
of
all
men
the
unselfish
desire
to
give
to
others
the
privileges
which
all
men
value
for
themselves
we
are
constrained
to
believe
the
great
body
of
thomas
jefferson
admirers
had
no
adequate
conception
they
were
just
such
democrats
as
the
patricians
of
rome
and
the
aristocracy
of
venice
lords
over
their
own
plantations
a
sort
of
holy
alliance
of
planters
admitting
and
defending
each
other
divine
right
of
mastership
still
in
virginia
maryland
and
in
other
sections
of
the
slave
states
truer
exponents
and
exemplifiers
of
the
idea
of
democracy
as
it
existed
in
the
mind
of
jefferson
were
not
wanting
in
the
debate
on
the
memorials
presented
to
the
first
congress
of
the
united
states
praying
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
voice
of
the
virginia
delegation
in
that
body
was
unanimous
in
deprecation
of
slavery
as
an
evil
social
moral
and
political
in
the
virginia
constitutional
convention
of
there
were
men
who
had
the
wisdom
to
perceive
and
the
firmness
to
declare
that
slavery
was
not
only
incompatible
with
the
honor
and
prosperity
of
the
state
but
wholly
indefensible
on
any
grounds
which
could
be
consistently
taken
by
a
republican
people
in
the
debate
on
the
same
subject
in
the
legislature
in
universal
and
impartial
democracy
found
utterance
from
eloquent
lips
we
might
say
as
much
of
kentucky
the
child
of
virginia
but
it
remains
true
that
these
were
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
with
the
language
of
universal
liberty
on
their
lips
and
moved
by
the
most
zealous
spirit
of
democratic
propagandism
the
greater
number
of
the
of
the
union
seem
never
to
have
understood
the
true
meaning
or
to
have
measured
the
length
and
breadth
of
that
doctrine
which
they
were
the
first
to
adopt
and
of
which
they
have
claimed
all
along
to
be
the
peculiar
and
chosen
advocates
the
northern
states
were
slow
to
adopt
the
democratic
creed
the
oligarchy
of
new
england
and
the
rich
proprietors
and
landholders
of
the
middle
states
turned
with
alarm
and
horror
from
the
levelling
doctrines
urged
upon
them
by
the
liberty
and
equality
propagandists
of
the
south
the
doctrines
of
virginia
were
quite
as
unpalatable
to
massachusetts
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
as
those
of
massachusetts
now
are
to
the
old
dominion
democracy
interfered
with
old
usages
and
institutions
and
threatened
to
plough
up
the
very
foundations
of
the
social
fabric
it
was
zealously
opposed
by
the
representatives
of
new
england
in
congress
and
in
the
home
legislatures
and
in
many
pulpits
hands
were
lifted
to
god
in
humble
entreaty
that
the
curse
and
bane
of
democracy
an
offshoot
of
the
rabid
jacobinism
of
revolutionary
france
might
not
be
permitted
to
take
root
and
overshadow
the
goodly
heritage
of
puritanism
the
alarmists
of
the
south
in
their
most
fervid
pictures
of
the
evils
to
be
apprehended
from
the
prevalence
of
doctrines
in
their
midst
have
drawn
nothing
more
fearful
than
the
visions
of
such
prophets
of
war
and
harbingers
of
ill
as
fisher
ames
in
the
forum
and
parish
in
the
desk
when
contemplating
the
inroads
of
jeffersonian
democracy
upon
the
politics
religion
and
property
of
the
north
but
great
numbers
of
the
free
laborers
of
the
northern
states
the
mechanics
and
small
farmers
took
a
very
different
view
of
the
matter
the
doctrines
of
jefferson
were
received
as
their
political
gospel
it
was
in
vain
that
federalism
denounced
with
indignation
the
impertinent
inconsistency
of
interference
in
behalf
of
liberty
in
the
free
states
come
the
doctrine
from
whom
it
might
the
people
felt
it
to
be
true
state
after
state
revolted
from
the
ranks
of
federalism
and
enrolled
itself
on
the
side
of
democracy
the
old
order
of
things
was
broken
up
equality
before
the
law
was
established
religious
tests
and
restrictions
of
the
right
of
suffrage
were
abrogated
take
massachusetts
for
example
there
the
resistance
to
democratic
principles
was
the
most
strenuous
and
longest
continued
yet
at
this
time
there
is
no
state
in
the
union
more
thorough
in
its
practical
adoption
of
them
no
property
qualifications
or
religious
tests
prevail
all
distinctions
of
sect
birth
or
color
are
repudiated
and
suffrage
is
universal
the
democracy
which
in
the
south
has
only
been
held
in
a
state
of
gaseous
abstraction
hardened
into
concrete
reality
in
the
cold
air
of
the
north
the
ideal
became
practical
for
it
had
found
lodgment
among
men
who
were
accustomed
to
act
out
their
convictions
and
test
all
their
theories
by
actual
experience
while
thus
making
a
practical
application
of
the
new
doctrine
the
people
of
the
free
states
could
not
but
perceive
the
incongruity
of
democracy
and
slavery

of

truthful
lines
of
his
great
poem
eaton

from
his
romantic
achievements
in

ignoble

issue
with

some
ten
years
later
the

antislavery
agitation
commenced
it
originated
beyond
a
question
in
the
democratic
element
with
the
words
of
jefferson
on
their
lips
young
earnest
and
enthusiastic
men
called
the
attention
of
the
community
to
the
moral
wrong
and
political
reproach
of
slavery
in
the
name
and
spirit
of
democracy
the
moral
and
political
powers
of
the
people
were
invoked
to
limit
discountenance
and
put
an
end
to
a
system
so
manifestly
subversive
of
its
foundation
principles
it
was
a
revival
of
the
language
of
jefferson
and
page
and
randolph
an
echo
of
the
voice
of
him
who
penned
the
declaration
of
independence
and
originated
the
ordinance

the
south
had
wellnigh
forgotten
the
actual
significance
of
the
teachings
of
its
early
political
prophets
and
their
renewal
in
the
shape
of
abolitionism
was
as
might
have
been
expected
strange
and
unwelcome
pleasant
enough
it
had
been
to
hold
up
occasionally
these
democratic
abstractions
for
the
purpose
of
challenging
the
world
admiration
and
cheaply
acquiring
the
character
of
lovers

while
in
the
full
exercise
of
his
despotic
power
was
quite
as
consistent
as
these
democratic
slaveowners
whose
admiration
of
liberty
increased
in
exact
ratio
with
its
distance
from
their
own
plantations
they
had
not
calculated
upon
seeing
their
doctrine
clothed
with
life
and
power
a
practical
reality
pressing
for
application
to
their
slaves
as
well
as
to
themselves
they
had
not
taken
into
account
the
beautiful
ordination
of
providence
that
no
man
can
vindicate
his
own
rights
without
directly
or
impliedly
including
in
that
vindication
the
rights
of
all
other

wrung

their
reluctant

and
their
class
little
dreamed
of
the
universal

which
has

been
made

their
guaranty
of

liberties
as
little
did

of

to
which

truth
is
universal
it
can
not
be
monopolized
by
selfishness
the
two
processions
look
upon
this
picture
and
on
this
hamlet
considering
that
we
have
a
slave
population
of
nearly
three
millions
and
that
in
one
half
of
the
states
of
the
republic
it
is
more
hazardous
to
act
upon
the
presumption
that
all
men
are
created
free
and
equal
than
it
would
be
in
austria
or
russia
the
lavish
expression
of
sympathy
and
extravagant
jubilation
with
which
as
a
people
we
are
accustomed
to
greet
movements
in
favor
of
freedom
abroad
are
not
a
little
remarkable
we
almost
went
into
ecstasies
over
the
first
french
revolution
we
filled
our
papers
with
the
speeches
of
orator
hunt
and
the
english
radicals
we
fraternized
with
the
united
irishmen
we
hailed
as
brothers
in
the
cause
of
freedom
the
very
mexicans
whom
we
have
since
wasted
with
fire
and
sword
our
orators
north
and
south
grew
eloquent
and
classic
over
the
greek
and
polish
revolutions
in
short
long
ere
this
if
the
walls
of
kingcraft
and
despotism
had
been
like
those
of
jericho
destined
to
be
overthrown
by
sound
our
fourth
of
july
and
ringings
together
with
our
fierce
grandiloquent
in
and
out
of
congress
on
the
occasions
referred
to
would
have
left
no
stone
upon
another
it
is
true
that
an
exception
must
be
made
in
the
case
of
hayti
we
fired
no
guns
drank
no
toasts
made
no
speeches
in
favor
of
the
establishment
of
that
new
republic
in
our
neighborhood
the
very
mention
of
the
possibility
that
haytien
delegates
might
ask
admittance
to
the
congress
of
the
free
republics
of
the
new
world
at
panama
frightened
from
their
propriety
the
eager
propagandists
of
republicanism
in
the
senate
and
gave
a
to
their
philanthropic
projects
but
as
hayti
is
a
republic
of
blacks
who
having
revolted
from
their
masters
as
well
as
from
the
mother
country
have
placed
themselves
entirely
without
the
pale
of
sympathy
by
their
impertinent
interference
with
the
monopoly
of
white
liberty
this
exception
by
no
means
disproves
the
general
fact
that
in
the
matter
of
admiration
of
freedom
afar
off
and
in
the
abstract
we
have
no
rivals
the
caricature
of
our
general
sympathizers
in
martin
chuzzlewit
is
by
no
means
a
fancy
sketch
the
news
of
the
revolution
of
the
three
days
in
paris
and
the
triumph
of
the
french
people
over
charles
and
his
ministers
as
a
matter
of
course
acted
with
great
effect
upon
our
national
susceptibility
we
all
threw
up
our
hats
in
excessive
joy
at
the
spectacle
of
a
king
dashed
down
headlong
from
his
throne
and
chased
out
of
his
kingdom
by
his
suffering
and
oppressed
subjects
we
took
half
the
credit
of
the
performance
to
ourselves
inasmuch
as
lafayette
was
a
principal
actor
in
it
our
editors
from
passamaquoddy

the
national
intelligencer
for
september
contains
a
full
account
of
the
public
rejoicings
of
the
good
people
of
washington
on
the
occasion
bells
were
rung
in
all
the
steeples
guns
were
fired
and
a
grand
procession
was
formed
including
the
president
of
the
united
states
the
heads
of
departments
and
other
public
functionaries
decorated
with
tricolored
ribbons
and
with
tricolored
flags
mingling
with
the
stripes
and
stars
over
their
heads
and
gazed
down
upon
by
bright
eyes
from
window
and
balcony
the
general
sympathizers
moved
slowly
and
majestically
through
the
broad
avenue
towards
the
capitol
to
celebrate
the
revival
of
french
liberty
in
a
manner
becoming
the
chosen
rulers
of
a
free
people
what
a
spectacle
was
this
for
the
representatives
of
european
kingcraft
at
our
seat
of
government
how
the
titled
agents
of
metternich
and
nicholas
must
have
trembled
in
view
of
this
imposing
demonstration
for
the
safety
of
their
peculiar
institutions
unluckily
however
the
moral
effect
of
this
grand
spectacle
was
marred
somewhat
by
the
appearance
of
another
procession
moving
in
a
contrary
direction
it
was
a
gang
of
slaves
handcuffed
in

the

the
american
spectator
a
paper
published
at
washington
at
that
time
speaking
of
this
black
procession
of
slavery
describes
it
as
driven
along
by
what
had
the
appearance
of
a
man
on
horseback
the
miserable
wretches
who
composed
it
were
doubtless
consigned
to
a
to
await
their
purchase
and
transportation
to
the
south
or
southwest
and
perhaps
formed
a
part
of
that
drove
of
human
beings

the

states
that
he
saw
on
the
saturday
following
males
and

chained
in
couples

strikes
us
that
our

is
very
much
in
the

of
the
poor

in
its

there
is
a
stammer
in
all
our

our
moral
and
political
homilies
are
sure
to
run
into
confusions
and
contradictions
and
the

comes

brother
jonathan
you

with

in

a
chapter
of
history
the
theory
which
a
grave
and
learned
northern
senator
has
recently
announced
in
congress
that
slavery
like
the
is
confined
by
natural
laws
to
certain
parallels
of
latitude
beyond
which
it
can
by
no
possibility
exist
however
it
may
have
satisfied
its
author
and
its
auditors
has
unfortunately
no
verification
in
the
facts
of
the
case
slavery
is
singularly
cosmopolitan
in
its
habits
the
offspring
of
pride
and
lust
and
avarice
it
is
indigenous
to
the
world
rooted
in
the
human
heart
it
defies
the
rigors
of
winter
in
the
steppes
of
tartary
and
the
fierce
sun
of
the
tropics
it
has
the
universal
acclimation
of
sin
the
first
account
we
have
of
negro
slaves
in
new
england
is
from
the
pen
of
john
josselyn
nineteen
years
after
the
landing
at
plymouth
this
interesting
traveller
was
for
some
time
the
guest
of
samuel
maverick
who
then
dwelt
like
a
feudal
baron
in
his
fortalice
on
noddle
island
surrounded
by
retainers
and
servants
bidding
defiance
to
his
indian
neighbors
behind
his
strong
walls
with
four
great
guns
mounted
thereon
and
giving
entertainment
to
all
gratis
on
the
of
october
about
nine
in
the
morning
maverick
negro
woman
says
josselyn
came
to
my
chamber
and
in
her
own
country
language
and
tune
sang
very
loud
and
shrill
going
out
to
her
she
used
a
great
deal
of
respect
towards
me
and
would
willingly
have
expressed
her
grief
in
english
had
she
been
able
to
speak
the
language
but
i
apprehended
it
by
her
countenance
and
deportment
whereupon
i
repaired
to
my
host
to
learn
of
him
the
cause
and
resolved
to
entreat
him
in
her
behalf
for
i
had
understood
that
she
was
a
queen
in
her
own
country
and
observed
a
very
dutiful
and
humble
garb
used
towards
her
by
another
negro
who
was
her
maid
maverick
was
desirous
to
have
a
breed
of
negroes
and
therefore
seeing
she
would
not
yield
by
persuasions
to
company
with
a
negro
young
man
he
had
in
his
house
he
commanded
him
willed
she
nilled
she
to
go
to
her
bed
which
was
no
sooner
done
than
she
thrust
him
out
again
this
she
took
in
high
disdain
beyond
her
slavery
and
this
was
the
cause
of
her
grief
that
the
peculiar
domestic
arrangements
and
unfastidious
economy
of
this
settler
were
not
countenanced
by
the
puritans
of
that
early
time
we
have
sufficient
evidence
it
is
but
fair
to
suppose
from
the
silence
of
all
other
writers
of
the
time
with
respect
to
negroes
and
slaves
that
this
case
was
a
marked
exception
to
the
general
habits
and
usage
of
the
colonists
at
an
early
period
a
traffic
was
commenced
between
the
new
england
colonies
and
that
of
barbadoes
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
slaves
were
brought
to
boston
from
that
island
the
laws
however
discouraged
their
introduction
and
purchase
giving
freedom
to
all
held
to
service
at
the
close
of
seven
years
in
two
years
after
josselyn
adventure
on
noddle
island
the
code
of
laws
known
by
the
name
of
the
body
of
liberties
was
adopted
by
the
colony
it
was
drawn
up
by
nathaniel
ward
the
learned
and
ingenious
author
of
the
cobbler
of
agawarn
the
earliest
poetical
satire
of
new
england
one
of
its
provisions
was
as
follows
there
shall
be
never
any
bond
slaverie
villainage
or
captivitie
amongst
us
unless
it
be
lawfull
captives
taken
in
just
warres
and
such
strangers
as
willingly
sell
themselves
or
are
sold
to
us
and
these
shall
have
all
the
liberties
and
christian
usages
which
the
law
of
god
established
in
israel
doth
morally
require
in
captain
smith
a
boston
in
connection
with
one
keeser
brought
home
two
negroes
whom
he
obtained
by
the
surprise
and
burning
of
a
negro
village
in
africa
and
the
massacre
of
many
of
its
inhabitants
sir
richard
saltonstall
one
of
the
assistants
presented
a
petition
to
the
general
court
stating
the
outrage
thereby
committed
as
threefold
in
its
nature
namely
murder
and
breaking
inasmuch
as
the
offence
of
chasing
the
negers
as
aforesayde
upon
the
sabbath
day
being
a
servile
work
and
such
as
can
not
be
considered
under
any
other
head
is
expressly
capital
by
the
law
of
god
for
which
reason
he
prays
that
the
offenders
may
be
brought
to
justice
soe
that
the
sin
they
have
committed
may
be
upon
their
own
heads
and
not
upon
ourselves
upon
this
petition
the
general
court
passed
the
following
order
eminently
worthy
of
men
professing
to
rule
in
the
fear
and
according
to
the
law
of
god
a
terror
to
and
a
praise
to
them
that
do
well
the
general
court
conceiving
themselves
bound
by
the
first
opportunity
to
bear
witness
against
the
heinous
and
crying
sin
of
as
also
to
prescribe
such
timely
redress
for
what
has
passed
and
such
a
law
for
the
future
as
may
sufficiently
deter
all
others
belonging
to
us
to
have
to
do
in
such
vile
and
odious
courses
justly
abhorred
of
all
good
and
just
men
do
order
that
the
negro
interpreter
and
others
unlawfully
taken
be
by
the
first
opportunity
at
the
charge
of
the
country
for
the
present
sent
to
his
native
country
guinea
and
a
letter
with
him
of
the
indignation
of
the
court
thereabout
and
justice
thereof
desiring
our
honored
governor
would
please
put
this
order
in
execution
there
is
so
far
as
we
know
no
historical
record
of
the
actual
return
of
these
stolen
men
to
their
home
a
letter
is
extant
however
addressed
in
behalf
of
the
general
court
to
a
williams
on
the
piscataqua
by
whom
one
of
the
negroes
had
been
purchased
requesting
him
to
send
the
man
forthwith
to
boston
that
he
may
be
sent
home
which
this
court
do
resolve
to
send
back
without
delay
three
years
after
in
the
following
law
was
placed
upon
the
of
the
massachusetts
colony
if
any
man
stealeth
a
man
or
mankind
he
shall
surely
be
put
to
death
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
these
early
attempts
to
introduce
slavery
into
new
england
were
opposed
by
severe
laws
and
by
that
strong
popular
sentiment
in
favor
of
human
liberty
which
characterized
the
christian
radicals
who
laid
the
foundations
of
the
colonies
it
was
not
the
rigor
of
her
northern
winter
nor
the
unkindly
soil
of
massachusetts
which
discouraged
the
introduction
of
slavery
in
the
first
of
her
existence
as
a
colony
it
was
the
puritan
recognition
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
in
sin
suffering
and
redemption
his
estimate
of
the
awful
responsibilities
and
eternal
destinies
of
humanity
his
hatred
of
wrong
and
tyranny
and
his
stern
sense
of
justice
which
led
him
to
impose
upon
the
african
the
terrible
penalty
of
the
mosaic
code
but
that
brave
old
generation
passed
away
the
civil
contentions
in
the
mother
country
drove
across
the
seas
multitudes
of
restless
adventurers
and
speculators
the
indian
wars
unsettled
and
demoralized
the
people
habits
of
luxury
and
the
greed
of
gain
took
the
place
of
the
severe
denial
and
rigid
virtues
of
the
fathers
hence
we
are
not
surprised
to
find
that
josselyn
in
his
second
visit
to
new
england
some
years
after
his
first
speaks
of
the
great
increase
of
servants
and
negroes
in
governor
bradstreet
in
answer
to
the
inquiries
of
his
majesty
privy
council
states
that
two
years
before
a
vessel
from
madagasca
brought
into
the
colony
betwixt
forty
and
fifty
negroes
mostly
women
and
children
who
were
sold
at
a
loss
to
the
owner
of
the
vessel
now
and
then
he
continues
two
or
three
negroes
are
brought
from
barbadoes
and
other
of
his
majesty
plantations
and
sold
for
twenty
pounds
apiece
so
that
there
may
be
within
the
government
about
one
hundred
or
one
hundred
and
twenty
and
it
may
be
as
many
scots
brought
hither
and
sold
for
servants
in
the
time
of
the
war
with
scotland
and
about
half
as
many
irish
the
owning
of
a
black
or
white
slave
or
servant
at
this
period
was
regarded
as
an
evidence
of
dignity
and
respectability
and
hence
magistrates
and
clergymen
winked
at
the
violation
of
the
law
by
the
mercenary
traders
and
supplied
themselves
without
scruple
indian
slaves
were
common
and
are
named
in
old
wills
deeds
and
inventories
with
horses
cows
and
household
furniture
as
early
as
the
year
we
find
william
hilton
of
newbury
sells
to
george
carr
for
one
quarter
part
of
a
vessel
james
my
indian
with
all
the
interest
i
have
in
him
to
be
his
servant
forever
some
were
taken
in
the
narragansett
war
and
other
indian
wars
others
were
brought
from
south
carolina
and
the
spanish
main
it
is
an
instructive
fact
as
illustrating
the
retributive
dealings
of
providence
that
the
direst
affliction
of
the
massachusetts
colony
the
witchcraft
terror
of
originated
with
the
indian
tituba
a
slave
in
the
family
of
the
minister
of
danvers
in
the
year
the
inhabitants
of
newbury
were
greatly
excited
by
the
arrest
of
a
jerseyman
who
had
been
engaged
in
enticing
indians
and
negroes
to
leave
their
masters
he
was
charged
before
the
court
with
saying
that
the
english
should
be
cut
off
and
the
negroes
set
free
james
a
negro
slave
and
joseph
an
indian
were
arrested
with
him
their
design
was
reported
to
be
to
seize
a
vessel
in
the
port
and
escape
to
canada
and
join
the
french
and
return
and
lay
waste
and
plunder
their
masters
they
were
to
come
back
with
five
hundred
indians
and
three
hundred
canadians
and
the
place
of
crossing
the
merrimac
river
and
of
the
first
encampment
on
the
other
side
were
even
said
to
be
fixed
upon
when
we
consider
that
there
could
not
have
been
more
than
a
score
of
slaves
in
the
settlement
the
excitement
into
which
the
inhabitants
were
thrown
by
this
absurd
rumor
of
conspiracy
seems
not
very
unlike
that
of
a
convocation
of
small
planters
in
a
backwoods
settlement
in
south
carolina
on
finding
an
newspaper
in
their
weekly
mail
bag
in
colonel
saltonstall
of
haverhill
had
several
negroes
and
among
them
a
girl
who
for
some
alleged
misdemeanor
was
severely
chastised
the
slave
resolved
upon
revenge
for
her
injury
and
soon
found
the
means
of
obtaining
it
the
colonel
had
on
hand
for
service
in
the
indian
war
then
raging
a
considerable
store
of
gunpowder
this
she
placed
under
the
room
in
which
her
master
and
mistress
slept
laid
a
long
train
and
dropped
a
coal
on
it
she
had
barely
time
to
escape
to
the
before
the
explosion
took
place
shattering
the
stately
mansion
into
fragments
saltonstall
and
his
wife
were
carried
on
their
bed
a
considerable
distance
happily
escaping
serious
injury
some
soldiers
stationed
in
the
house
were
scattered
in
all
directions
but
no
lives
were
lost
the
colonel
on
recovering
from
the
effects
of
his
sudden
overturn
hastened
to
the
and
found
his
servants
all
up
save
the
author
of
the
mischief
who
was
snug
in
bed
and
apparently
in
a
quiet
sleep
in
an
attempt
was
made
in
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
to
prevent
the
increase
of
slaves
judge
sewall
soon
after
published
a
pamphlet
against
slavery
but
it
seems
with
little
effect
boston
merchants
and
became
to
a
considerable
extent
involved
in
the
distilleries
established
in
that
place
and
in
rhode
island
furnished
rum
for
the
african
market
the
slaves
were
usually
taken
to
the
west
indies
although
occasionally
part
of
a
cargo
found
its
way
to
new
england
where
the
wholesome
old
laws
against
had
become
a
dead
letter
on
the
in
a
bill
was
brought
before
the
legislature
of
massachusetts
to
prevent
the
unwarrantable
and
unnatural
custom
of
enslaving
mankind
the
council
of
governor
bernard
sent
it
back
to
the
house
greatly
changed
and
curtailed
and
it
was
lost
by
the
disagreement
of
the
two
branches
governor
bernard
threw
his
influence
on
the
side
of
slavery
in
a
bill
prohibiting
the
traffic
in
slaves
passed
both
houses
but
governor
hutchinson
withheld
his
assent
and
dismissed
the
legislature
the
colored
men
sent
a
deputation
of
their
own
to
the
governor
to
solicit
his
consent
to
the
bill
but
he
told
them
his
instructions
forbade
him
a
similar
committee
waiting
upon
general
gage
received
the
same
answer
in
the
year
a
servant
of
richard
lechmere
of
cambridge
stimulated
by
the
general
discussion
of
the
slavery
question
and
by
the
advice
of
some
of
the
zealous
advocates
of
emancipation
brought
an
action
against
his
master
for
detaining
him
in
bondage
the
suit
was
decided
in
his
favor
two
years
before
the
similar
decision
in
the
case
of
somerset
in
england
the
funds
necessary
for
carrying
on
this
suit
were
raised
among
the
blacks
themselves
other
suits
followed
in
various
parts
of
the
province
and
the
result
was
in
every
instance
the
freedom
of
the
plaintiff
in
caesar
hendrick
sued
his
master
one
greenleaf
of
newburyport
for
damages
laid
at
fifty
pounds
for
holding
him
as
a
slave
the
jury
awarded
him
his
freedom
and
eighteen
pounds
according
to
belknap
whose
answers
to
the
queries
on
the
subject
propounded
by
judge
tucker
of
virginia
have
furnished
us
with
many
of
the
facts
above
stated
the
principal
grounds
upon
which
the
counsel
of
the
masters
depended
were
that
the
negroes
were
purchased
in
open
market
and
included
in
the
bills
of
sale
like
other
property
that
slavery
was
sanctioned
by
usage
and
finally
that
the
laws
of
the
province
recognized
its
existence
by
making
masters
liable
for
the
maintenance
of
their
slaves
or
servants
on
the
part
of
the
blacks
the
law
and
usage
of
the
mother
country
confirmed
by
the
great
charter
that
no
man
can
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
but
by
the
judgment
of
his
peers
were
effectually
pleaded
the
early
laws
of
the
province
prohibited
slavery
and
no
subsequent
legislation
had
sanctioned
it
for
although
the
laws
did
recognize
its
existence
they
did
so
only
to
mitigate
and
modify
an
admitted
evil
the
present
state
constitution
was
established
in
the
first
article
of
the
bill
of
rights
prohibited
slavery
by
affirming
the
foundation
truth
of
our
republic
that
all
men
are
born
free
and
equal
the
supreme
court
decided
in
that
no
man
could
hold
another
as
property
without
a
direct
violation
of
that
article
in
three
free
black
citizens
of
boston
were
kidnapped
and
sold
into
slavery
in
one
of
the
french
islands
an
intense
excitement
followed
governor
hancock
took
efficient
measures
for
reclaiming
the
unfortunate
men
the
clergy
of
boston
petitioned
the
legislature
for
a
total
prohibition
of
the
foreign
the
society
of
friends
and
the
blacks
generally
presented
similar
petitions
and
the
same
year
an
act
was
passed
prohibiting
the
and
granting
relief
to
persons
kidnapped
or
decoyed
out
of
the
commonwealth
the
fear
of
a
burden
to
the
state
from
the
influx
of
negroes
from
abroad
led
the
legislature
in
connection
with
this
law
to
prevent
those
who
were
not
citizens
of
the
state
or
of
other
states
from
gaining
a
residence
the
first
case
of
the
arrest
of
a
fugitive
slave
in
massachusetts
under
the
law
of
took
place
in
boston
soon
after
the
passage
of
the
law
it
is
the
case
to
which
president
quincy
alludes
in
his
late
letter
against
the
fugitive
slave
law
the
populace
at
the
trial
aided
the
slave
to
escape
and
nothing
further
was
done
about
it
the
arrest
of
george
latimer
as
a
slave
in
boston
and
his
illegal
confinement
in
jail
in
led
to
the
passage
of
the
law
of
for
the
protection
of
personal
liberty
prohibiting
state
officers
from
arresting
or
detaining
persons
claimed
as
slaves
and
the
use
of
the
jails
of
the
commonwealth
for
their
confinement
this
law
was
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
the
supreme
judiciary
in
the
case
of
prigg
vs
the
state
of
pennsylvania
that
the
reclaiming
of
fugitives
was
a
matter
exclusively
belonging
to
the
general
government
yet
that
the
state
officials
might
if
they
saw
fit
carry
into
effect
the
law
of
congress
on
the
subject
unless
prohibited
by
state
legislation
it
will
be
seen
by
the
facts
we
have
adduced
that
slavery
in
massachusetts
never
had
a
legal
existence
the
ermine
of
the
judiciary
of
the
puritan
state
has
never
been
sullied
by
the
admission
of
its
detestable
claims
it
crept
into
the
commonwealth
like
other
evils
and
vices
but
never
succeeded
in
clothing
itself
with
the
sanction
and
authority
of
law
it
stood
only
upon
its
own
execrable
foundation
of
robbery
and
wrong
with
a
history
like
this
to
look
back
upon
is
it
strange
that
the
people
of
massachusetts
at
the
present
day
are
unwilling
to
see
their
honored
defences
of
personal
freedom
the
good
old
safeguards
of
saxon
liberty
overridden
and
swept
away
after
the
summary
fashion
of
the
fugitive
slave
bill
that
they
should
loathe
and
scorn
the
task
which
that
bill
imposes
upon
them
of
aiding
professional
in
seizing
fettering
and
consigning
to
bondage
men
and
women
accused
only
of
that
which
commends
them
to
esteem
and
sympathy
love
of
liberty
and
hatred
of
slavery
that
they
can
not
at
once
adjust
themselves
to
constitutional
duties
which
in
south
carolina
and
georgia
are
reserved
for
trained
bloodhounds
surely
in
view
of
what
massachusetts
has
been
and
her
strong
bias
in
favor
of
human
freedom
derived
from
her
hearted
founders
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
executive
and
cabinet
at
washington
will
grant
her
some
little
respite
some
space
for
turning
some
opportunity
for
conquering
her
prejudices
before
letting
loose
the
dogs
of
war
upon
her
let
them
give
her
time
and
treat
with
forbearance
her
hesitation
qualms
of
conscience
and
wounded
pride
her
people
indeed
are
awkward
in
the
work
of
and
it
would
seem
rendered
but
indifferent
service
in
a
late
hunt
in
boston
whether
they
would
do
better
under
the
surveillance
of
the
army
and
navy
of
the
united
states
is
a
question
which
we
leave
with
the
president
and
his
secretary
of
state
general
putnam
once
undertook
to
drill
a
company
of
quakers
and
instruct
them
by
force
of
arms
in
the
art
and
mystery
of
fighting
but
not
a
single
pair
of
breeches
moved
at
his
forward
march
not
a
broad
beaver
wheeled
at
his
word
of
command
no
hand
unclosed
to
receive
a
proffered
musket
patriotic
appeal
hard
swearing
and
prick
of
bayonet
had
no
effect
upon
these
impracticable
raw
recruits
and
the
stout
general
gave
them
up
in
despair
we
are
inclined
to
believe
that
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
of
our
army
and
navy
to
convert
the
good
people
of
massachusetts
into
expert
under
the
discipline
of
west
point
and
norfolk
would
prove
as
idle
an
experiment
as
that
of
general
putnam
upon
the
quakers
thomas
carlyle
on
the
a
late
number
of
fraser
magazine
contains
an
article
bearing
the
unmistakable
impress
of
the
peculiarities
of
thomas
carlyle
entitled
occasional
discourse
on
the
negro
question
which
would
be
interesting
as
a
literary
curiosity
were
it
not
in
spirit
and
tendency
so
unspeakably
wicked
as
to
excite
in
every
rightminded
reader
a
feeling
of
amazement
and
disgust
with
a
hard
brutal
audacity
a
blasphemous
irreverence
and
a
sneering
mockery
which
would
do
honor
to
the
devil
of
faust
it
takes
issue
with
the
moral
sense
of
mankind
and
the
precepts
of
christianity
having
ascertained
that
the
exports
of
sugar
and
spices
from
the
west
indies
have
diminished
since
emancipation
and
that
the
negroes
having
worked
as
they
believed
quite
long
enough
without
wages
now
refuse
to
work
for
the
planters
without
higher
pay
than
the
latter
with
the
thriftless
and
evil
habits
of
slavery
still
clinging
to
them
can
afford
to
give
the
author
considers
himself
justified
in
denouncing
negro
emancipation
as
one
of
the
shams
which
he
was
specially
sent
into
this
world
to
belabor
had
he
confned
himself
to
simple
abuse
and
caricature
of
the
and
christian
abolitionists
of
england
the
philanthropists
of
exeter
hall
there
would
have
been
small
occasion
for
noticing
his
splenetic
and
discreditable
production
doubtless
there
is
a
cant
of
philanthropy
the
alloy
of
human
frailty
and
folly
in
the
most
righteous
reforms
which
is
a
fair
subject
for
the
indignant
sarcasm
of
a
professed
hater
of
shows
and
falsities
whatever
is
hollow
and
hypocritical
in
politics
morals
or
religion
comes
very
properly
within
the
scope
of
his
mockery
and
we
bid
him
godspeed
in
plying
his
satirical
lash
upon
it
impostures
and
frauds
of
all
kinds
deserve
nothing
better
than
detection
and
exposure
let
him
blow
them
up
to
his
heart
content
as
daniel
did
the
image
of
bell
and
the
dragon
but
our
author
in
this
matter
of
negro
slavery
has
undertaken
to
apply
his
explosive
pitch
and
rosin
not
to
the
affectation
of
humanity
but
to
humanity
itself
he
mocks
at
pity
scoffs
at
all
who
seek
to
lessen
the
amount
of
pain
and
suffering
sneers
at
and
denies
the
most
sacred
rights
and
mercilessly
consigns
an
entire
class
of
the
children
of
his
heavenly
father
to
the
doom
of
compulsory
servitude
he
vituperates
the
poor
black
man
with
a
coarse
brutality
which
would
do
credit
to
a
mississippi
or
a
renegade
yankee
dealer
in
human
cattle
on
the
banks
of
the
potomac
his
rhetoric
has
a
flavor
of
the
and
vulgar
unmanly
indecent
a
scandalous
outrage
upon
good
taste
and
refined
feeling
which
at
once
degrades
the
author
and
insults
his
readers
he
assumes
for
he
is
one
of
those
sublimated
philosophers
who
reject
the
baconian
system
of
induction
and
depend
upon
intuition
without
recourse
to
facts
and
figures
that
the
emancipated
class
in
the
west
india
islands
are
universally
idle
improvident
and
unfit
for
freedom
that
god
created
them
to
be
the
servants
and
slaves
of
their
born
lords
the
white
men
and
designed
them
to
grow
sugar
coffee
and
spices
for
their
masters
instead
of
raising
pumpkins
and
yams
for
themselves
and
that
if
they
will
not
do
this
the
beneficent
whip
should
be
again
employed
to
compel
them
he
adopts
in
speaking
of
the
black
class
the
lowest
slang
of
vulgar
prejudice
black
quashee
sneers
the
gentlemanly
philosopher
black
quashee
if
he
will
not
help
in
bringing
out
the
spices
will
get
himself
made
a
slave
again
which
state
will
be
a
little
less
ugly
than
his
present
one
and
with
beneficent
whip
since
other
methods
avail
not
will
be
compelled
to
work
it
is
difficult
to
treat
sentiments
so
atrocious
and
couched
in
such
offensive
language
with
anything
like
respect
common
sense
and
unperverted
conscience
revolt
instinctively
against
them
the
doctrine
they
inculcate
is
that
which
underlies
all
tyranny
and
wrong
of
man
towards
man
it
is
that
under
which
the
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
unto
this
day
it
is
as
old
as
sin
the
perpetual
argument
of
strength
against
weakness
of
power
against
right
that
of
the
greek
philosopher
that
the
barbarians
being
of
an
inferior
race
were
born
to
be
slaves
to
the
greeks
and
of
the
infidel
hobbes
that
every
man
being
by
nature
at
war
with
every
other
man
has
a
perpetual
right
to
reduce
him
to
servitude
if
he
has
the
power
it
is
the
cardinal
doctrine
of
what
john
quincy
adams
has
very
properly
styled
the
satanic
school
of
philosophy
the
ethics
of
an
old
norse
sea
robber
or
an
arab
plunderer
of
caravans
it
is
as
widely
removed
from
the
sweet
humanities
and
unselfish
benevolence
of
christianity
as
the
faith
and
practice
of
the
east
india
thug
or
the
new
zealand
cannibal
our
author
does
not
however
take
us
altogether
by
surprise
he
has
before
given
no
uncertain
intimations
of
the
point
towards
which
his
philosophy
was
tending
in
his
brilliant
essay
upon
of
paraguay
for
instance
we
find
him
entering
with
manifest
satisfaction
and
admiration
into
the
details
of
his
hero
tyranny
in
his
and
speeches
of
oliver
cromwell
in
half
a
dozen
pages
of
savage
and
almost
diabolical
sarcasm
directed
against
the
growing
humanity
of
the
age
the
sentimentalisms
and
squeamishness
which
shudders
at
the
sight
of
blood
and
infliction
of
pain
he
prepares
the
way
for
a
justification
of
the
massacre
of
drogheda
more
recently
he
has
intimated
that
the
extermination
of
the
celtic
race
is
the
best
way
of
settling
the
irish
question
and
that
the
enslavement
and
forcible
transportation
of
her
poor
to
labor
under
armed
taskmasters
in
the
colonies
is
the
only
rightful
and
proper
remedy
for
the
political
and
social
evils
of
england
in
the
on
negro
slavery
we
see
this
devilish
philosophy
in
full
bloom
the
gods
he
tells
us
are
with
the
strong
might
has
a
divine
right
to
rule
blessed
are
the
crafty
of
brain
and
strong
of
hand
weakness
is
crime
vae
victis
as
brennus
said
when
he
threw
his
sword
into
the
scale
woe
to
the
conquered
the
negro
is
weaker
in
intellect
than
his
born
lord
the
white
man
and
has
no
right
to
choose
his
own
vocation
let
the
latter
do
it
for
him
and
if
need
be
return
to
the
beneficent
whip
on
the
side
of
the
oppressor
there
is
power
let
him
use
it
without
mercy
and
hold
flesh
and
blood
to
the
grindstone
with
unrelenting
rigor
humanity
is
squeamishness
pity
for
the
suffering
mere
sentimentalism
maudlin
and
unmanly
the
gods
the
old
norse
gods
doubtless
laugh
to
scorn
alike
the
complaints
of
the
miserable
and
the
weak
compassions
and
philanthropisms
of
those
who
would
relieve
them
this
is
the
substance
of
thomas
carlyle
advice
this
is
the
matured
fruit
of
his
philosophic
husbandry
the
grand
result
for
which
he
has
been
all
his
life
sounding
unfathomable
abysses
or
beating
about
in
the
thin
air
of
transcendentalism
such
is
the
substitute
which
he
offers
us
for
the
sermon
on
the
mount
he
tells
us
that
the
blacks
have
no
right
to
use
the
islands
of
the
west
indies
for
growing
pumpkins
and
garden
stuffs
for
their
own
use
and
behoof
because
but
for
the
wisdom
and
skill
of
the
whites
these
islands
would
have
been
productive
only
of
jungle
savagery
and
swamp
malaria
the
negro
alone
could
never
have
improved
the
islands
or
civilized
himself
and
therefore
their
and
his
born
lord
the
white
man
has
a
right
to
the
benefits
of
his
own
betterments
of
land
and
legged
cattle
black
quashee
has
no
right
to
dispose
of
himself
and
his
labor
because
he
owes
his
partial
civilization
to
others
and
pray
how
has
it
been
with
the
white
race
for
whom
our
philosopher
claims
the
divine
prerogative
of
enslaving
some
twenty
and
odd
centuries
ago
a
pair
of
savages
daubed
with
paint
might
have
been
seen
roaming
among
the
hills
and
woods
of
the
northern
part
of
the
british
island
subsisting
on
acorns
and
the
flesh
of
wild
animals
with
an
occasional
relish
of
the
smoked
hams
and
pickled
fingers
of
some
unfortunate
stranger
caught
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
tweed
this
interesting
couple
reared
as
they
best
could
a
family
of
children
who
in
turn
became
the
heads
of
families
and
some
time
about
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
one
of
their
descendants
in
the
borough
of
ecclefechan
rejoiced
over
the
birth
of
a
man
child
now
somewhat
famous
as
thomas
carlyle
a
maker
of
books
does
it
become
such
a
one
to
rave
against
the
west
india
negro
incapacity
for
unaided
by
the
arts
sciences
and
refinements
of
the
romans
he
might
have
been
at
this
very
day
squatted
on
his
naked
haunches
in
the
woods
of
ecclefechan
painting
his
epidermis
in
the
sun
like
his
piet
ancestors
where
in
fact
can
we
look
for
unaided
and
spontaneous
internal
development
to
any
considerable
extent
on
the
part
of
any
nation
or
people
from
people
to
people
the
original
given
impulse
towards
civilization
and
perfection
has
been
transmitted
as
from
egypt
to
greece
and
thence
to
the
roman
world
but
the
blacks
we
are
told
are
indolent
and
insensible
to
the
duty
of
raising
sugar
and
coffee
and
spice
for
the
whites
being
mainly
careful
to
provide
for
their
own
household
and
till
their
own
gardens
for
domestic
comforts
and
necessaries
the
exports
have
fallen
off
somewhat
and
what
does
this
prove
only
that
the
negro
is
now
a
consumer
of
products
of
which
under
the
rule
of
the
whip
he
was
a
producer
merely
as
to
indolence
under
the
proper
stimulus
of
fair
wages
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
charge
is
not
sustained
if
unthrifty
habits
and
lack
of
prudence
on
the
part
of
the
owners
of
estates
combined
with
the
repeal
of
duties
on
foreign
sugars
by
the
british
government
have
placed
it
out
of
their
power
to
pay
just
and
reasonable
wages
for
labor
who
can
blame
the
blacks
if
they
prefer
to
cultivate
their
own
garden
plots
rather
than
raise
sugar
and
spice
for
their
late
masters
upon
terms
little
better
than
those
of
their
old
condition
the
beneficent
whip
always
excepted
the
despatches
of
the
colonial
governors
agree
in
admitting
that
the
blacks
have
had
great
cause
for
complaint
and
dissatisfaction
owing
to
the
delay
or
of
their
wages
sir
gray
writing
from
jamaica
says
that
in
a
good
many
instances
the
payment
of
the
wages
they
have
earned
has
been
either
very
irregularly
made
or
not
at
all
probably
on
account
of
the
inability
of
the
employers
he
says
moreover
the
negroes
appear
to
me
to
be
generally
as
free
from
rebellious
tendencies
or
turbulent
feelings
and
malicious
thoughts
as
any
race
of
laborers
i
ever
saw
or
heard
of
my
impression
is
indeed
that
under
a
system
of
perfectly
fair
dealing
and
of
real
justice
they
will
come
to
be
an
admirable
peasantry
and
yeomanry
industrious
and
working
frank
and
it
must
indeed
be
admitted
that
judging
by
their
diminished
exports
and
the
growing
complaints
of
the
owners
of
estates
the
condition
of
the
islands
in
a
financial
point
of
view
is
by
no
means
favorable
an
immediate
cause
of
this
however
must
be
found
in
the
unfortunate
sugar
act
of
the
more
remote
but
for
the
most
part
powerful
cause
of
the
present
depression
is
to
be
traced
to
the
vicious
and
unnatural
system
of
slavery
which
has
been
gradually
but
surely
preparing
the
way
for
ruin
bankruptcy
and
demoralization
never
yet
by
a
community
or
an
individual
have
the
righteous
laws
of
god
been
violated
with
impunity
sooner
or
later
comes
the
penalty
which
the
infinite
justice
has
affixed
to
sin
partial
and
temporary
evils
and
inconveniences
have
undoubtedly
resulted
from
the
emancipation
of
the
laborers
and
many
years
must
elapse
before
the
relations
of
the
two
heretofore
antagonistic
classes
can
be
perfectly
adjusted
and
their
interests
brought
into
entire
harmony
but
that
freedom
is
not
to
be
held
mainly
accountable
for
the
depression
of
the
british
colonies
is
obvious
from
the
fact
that
dutch
surinam
where
the
old
system
of
slavery
remains
in
its
original
rigor
is
in
an
equally
depressed
condition
the
neuws
en
advertentie
blad
quoted
in
the
jamaica
gazette
says
under
date
of
january
around
us
we
hear
nothing
but
complaints
people
seek
and
find
matter
in
everything
to
picture
to
themselves
the
lot
of
the
place
in
which
they
live
as
bitterer
than
that
of
any
other
country
of
a
large
number
of
flourishing
plantations
few
remain
that
can
now
be
called
such
so
deteriorated
has
property
become
within
the
last
few
years
that
many
of
these
estates
have
not
been
able
to
defray
their
weekly
expenses
the
colony
stands
on
the
brink
of
a
yawning
abyss
into
which
it
must
inevitably
plunge
unless
some
new
and
better
system
is
speedily
adopted
it
is
impossible
that
our
agriculture
can
any
longer
proceed
on
its
old
footing
our
laboring
force
is
dying
away
and
the
social
position
they
held
must
undergo
a
revolution
the
paper
from
which
we
have
quoted
the
official
journal
of
the
colony
thinks
the
condition
of
the
emancipated
british
colonies
decidedly
preferable
to
that
of
surinam
where
the
old
slave
system
has
continued
in
force
and
insists
that
the
dutch
government
must
follow
the
example
of
great
britain
the
actual
condition
of
the
british
colonies
since
emancipation
is
perfectly
well
known
in
surinam
three
of
them
essequibo
demerara
and
berbice
being
its
immediate
neighbors
whatever
evils
and
inconveniences
have
resuited
from
emancipation
must
be
well
understood
by
the
dutch
yet
we
find
them
looking
towards
emancipation
as
the
only
prospect
of
remedy
for
the
greater
evils
of
their
own
system
this
fact
is
of
itself
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
assumption
of
carlyle
and
others
that
what
they
call
the
ruin
of
the
colonies
has
been
produced
by
the
emancipation
acts
of
and
we
have
no
fears
whatever
of
the
efect
of
this
literary
monstrosity
which
we
have
been
considering
upon
the
british
colonies
quashee
black
and
ignorant
as
he
may
be
will
not
get
himself
made
a
slave
again
the
mission
of
the
beneficent
whip
is
there
pretty
well
over
and
it
may
now
find
its
place
in
museums
and
cabinets
of
ghastly
curiosities
with
the
racks
pillories
thumbscrews
and
of
old
days
what
we
have
feared
however
is
that
the
advocates
and
defenders
of
in
this
country
might
find
in
this
discourse
matter
of
encouragement
and
that
our
prejudices
against
the
colored
man
might
be
strengthened
and
confirmed
by
its
malignant
vituperation
and
sarcasm
on
this
point
we
have
sympathized
with
the
forebodings
of
an
eloquent
writer
in
the
london
enquirer
we
can
not
imagine
a
more
deadly
moral
poison
for
the
american
people
than
his
carlyle
last
composition
every
cruel
practice
of
social
exclusion
will
derive
from
it
new
sharpness
and
venom
the
of
course
will
exult
to
find
himself
not
apologized
for
but
enthusiastically
cheered
upheld
and
glorified
by
a
writer
of
european
celebrity
but
it
is
not
merely
the
slave
who
will
feel
hand
in
the
torture
of
his
flesh
the
riveting
of
his
fetters
and
the
denial
of
light
to
his
mind
the
free
black
will
feel
him
too
in
the
more
contemptuous
and
abhorrent
scowl
of
his
brother
man
who
will
easily
derive
from
this
unfortunate
essay
the
belief
that
his
inhuman
feelings
are
of
divine
ordination
it
is
a
true
work
of
the
devil
the
fostering
of
a
tyrannical
prejudice
far
and
wide
over
space
and
long
into
the
future
the
winged
words
of
evil
counsel
will
go
in
the
in
the
house
in
the
theatre
and
in
the
church
by
land
and
by
sea
in
all
the
haunts
of
men
their
influence
will
be
felt
in
a
perennial
growth
of
hate
and
scorn
and
suffering
and
resentment
amongst
the
sufferers
will
be
many
to
whom
education
has
given
every
refined
susceptibility
that
makes
contempt
and
exclusion
bitter
men
and
women
faithful
and
diligent
loving
and
worthy
to
be
loved
and
bearing
it
may
be
no
more
than
an
almost
imperceptible
trace
of
african
descent
will
continue
yet
longer
to
be
banished
from
the
social
meal
of
the
white
man
and
to
be
spurned
from
his
presence
in
the
house
of
god
because
a
writer
of
genius
has
lent
the
weight
of
his
authority
and
his
fame
if
not
of
his
power
to
the
perpetuation
of
a
prejudice
which
christianity
was
undermining
a
more
recent
production
day
pamphlets
in
which
capability
of
is
more
than
doubted
democracy
somewhat
contemptuously
sneered
at
and
the
model
republic
itself
stigmatized
as
a
nation
of
bores
may
have
a
salutary
effect
in
restraining
our
admiration
and
in
lessening
our
respect
for
the
defender
and
eulogist
of
slavery
the
sweeping
impartiality
with
which
in
this
latter
production
he
applies
the
principle
of
our
peculiar
institution
to
the
laboring
poor
man
irrespective
of
color
recognizing
as
his
only
inalienable
right
the
right
of
being
set
to
labor
for
his
born
lords
will
we
imagine
go
far
to
neutralize
the
mischief
of
his
discourse
upon
negro
slavery
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
find
so
much
intellectual
power
as
carlyle
really
possesses
so
little
under
the
control
of
the
moral
sentiments
in
some
of
his
earlier
writings
as
for
instance
his
beautiful
tribute
to
the
corn
law
rhymer
we
thought
we
saw
evidence
of
a
warm
and
generous
sympathy
with
the
poor
and
the
wronged
a
desire
to
ameliorate
human
suffering
which
would
have
done
credit
to
the
philanthropisms
of
exeter
hall
and
the
abolition
of
pain
society
latterly
however
like
moliere
quack
he
has
changed
all
that
his
heart
has
got
upon
the
wrong
side
or
rather
he
seems
to
us
very
much
in
the
condition
of
the
in
the
german
tale
who
had
swapped
his
heart
of
flesh
for
a
cobblestone
formation
of
the
american
antislavery
society
a
letter
to
william
lloyd
garrison
president
of
the
society
amesbury
my
dear
friend
i
have
received
thy
kind
letter
with
the
accompanying
circular
inviting
me
to
attend
the
commemoration
of
the
thirtieth
anniversary
of
the
formation
of
the
american
society
at
philadelphia
it
is
with
the
deepest
regret
that
i
am
compelled
by
the
feeble
state
of
my
health
to
give
up
all
hope
of
meeting
thee
and
my
other
old
and
dear
friends
on
an
occasion
of
so
much
interest
how
much
it
costs
me
to
acquiesce
in
the
hard
necessity
thy
own
feelings
will
tell
thee
better
than
any
words
of
mine
i
look
back
over
thirty
years
and
call
to
mind
all
the
circumstances
of
my
journey
to
philadelphia
in
company
with
thyself
and
the
excellent
thurston
of
maine
even
then
as
we
thought
an
old
man
but
still
living
and
true
as
ever
to
the
good
cause
i
recall
the
early
gray
morning
when
with
samuel
j
may
our
colleague
on
the
committee
to
prepare
a
declaration
of
sentiments
for
the
convention
i
climbed
to
the
small
upper
chamber
of
a
colored
friend
to
hear
thee
read
the
first
draft
of
a
paper
which
will
live
as
long
as
our
national
history
i
see
the
members
of
the
convention
solemnized
by
the
responsibility
rise
one
by
one
and
solemnly
affix
their
names
to
that
stern
pledge
of
fidelity
to
freedom
of
the
signers
many
have
passed
away
from
earth
a
few
have
faltered
and
turned
back
but
i
believe
the
majority
still
live
to
rejoice
over
the
great
triumph
of
truth
and
justice
and
to
devote
what
remains
of
time
and
strength
to
the
cause
to
which
they
consecrated
their
youth
and
manhood
thirty
years
ago
for
while
we
may
well
thank
god
and
congratulate
one
another
on
the
prospect
of
the
speedy
emancipation
of
the
slaves
of
the
united
states
we
must
not
for
a
moment
forget
that
from
this
hour
new
and
mighty
responsibilities
devolve
upon
us
to
aid
direct
and
educate
these
millions
left
free
indeed
but
bewildered
ignorant
naked
and
foodless
in
the
wild
chaos
of
civil
war
we
have
to
undo
the
accumulated
wrongs
of
two
centuries
to
remake
the
manhood
which
slavery
has
nigh
unmade
to
see
to
it
that
the
colored
man
has
a
fair
field
for
development
and
improvement
and
to
tread
under
our
feet
the
last
vestige
of
that
hateful
prejudice
which
has
been
the
strongest
external
support
of
southern
slavery
we
must
lift
ourselves
at
once
to
the
true
christian
altitude
where
all
distinctions
of
black
and
white
are
overlooked
in
the
heartfelt
recognition
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
i
must
not
close
this
letter
without
confessing
that
i
can
not
be
sufficiently
thankful
to
the
divine
providence
which
in
a
great
measure
through
thy
instrumentality
turned
me
away
so
early
from
what
roger
williams
calls
the
world
great
trinity
pleasure
profit
and
honor
to
take
side
with
the
poor
and
oppressed
i
am
not
insensible
to
literary
reputation
i
love
perhaps
too
well
the
praise
and
of
my
but
i
set
a
higher
value
on
my
name
as
appended
to
the
declaration
of
than
on
the
of
any
book
looking
over
a
life
marked
by
many
errors
and
shortcomings
i
rejoice
that
i
have
been
able
to
maintain
the
pledge
of
that
signature
and
that
in
the
long
intervening
years
my
voice
though
not
the
loudest
has
been
heard
wherever
freedom
raised
her
cry
of
pain
let
me
through
thee
extend
a
warm
greeting
to
the
friends
whether
of
our
own
or
the
new
generation
who
may
assemble
on
the
occasion
of
commemoration
there
is
work
yet
to
be
done
which
will
task
the
best
efforts
of
us
all
for
thyself
i
need
not
say
that
the
love
and
esteem
of
early
boyhood
have
lost
nothing
by
the
test
of
time
and
i
am
very
cordially
thy
friend
john
whittier
the
lesson
and
our
duty
from
the
amesbury
villager
in
the
assassination
of
abraham
lincoln
and
the
unspeakably
brutal
assault
upon
secretary
seward
slavery
has
made
another
revelation
of
itself
perhaps
it
was
needed
in
the
magnanimity
of
assured
victory
we
were
perhaps
disposed
to
overlook
not
so
much
the
guilty
leaders
and
misguided
masses
of
the
great
rebellion
as
the
unutterable
horror
and
sin
of
slavery
which
prompted
it
how
slowly
we
of
the
north
have
learned
the
true
character
of
this
mighty
mischief
how
our
politicians
bowed
their
strong
shoulders
under
its
burthens
how
our
churches
reverenced
it
how
our
clergy
contrasted
the
north
with
the
purely
orthodox
and
scriptural
type
of
christianity
how
all
classes
hunted
down
not
merely
the
fugitive
slave
but
the
few
who
ventured
to
give
him
food
and
shelter
and
a
godspeed
in
his
flight
from
bondage
how
utterly
ignored
was
the
negro
claim
of
common
humanity
how
readily
was
the
decision
of
the
chief
justice
acquiesced
in
that
the
black
man
had
no
rights
which
the
white
man
is
bound
to
respect
we
saw
a
senator
of
the
united
states
and
honored
for
his
learning
talents
and
stainless
integrity
beaten
down
and
all
but
murdered
at
his
official
desk
by
a
south
carolina
for
the
crime
of
speaking
against
the
extension
of
slavery
and
we
heard
the
dastardly
deed
applauded
throughout
the
south
while
its
brutal
perpetrator
was
rewarded
with
orations
and
gifts
and
smiles
of
beauty
as
a
chivalrous
gentleman
we
saw
slavery
enter
kansas
with
bowieknife
in
hand
and
curses
on
its
lips
we
saw
the
life
of
the
union
struck
at
by
secession
and
rebellion
we
heard
of
the
bones
of
sons
and
brothers
fallen
in
defence
of
freedom
and
law
dug
up
and
wrought
into
ornaments
for
the
wrists
and
bosoms
of
women
we
looked
into
the
open
hell
of
andersonville
upon
the
deliberate
systematic
starvation
of
helpless
prisoners
we
heard
of
libby
prison
underlaid
with
gunpowder
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
thousands
of
union
prisoners
in
case
of
the
occupation
of
richmond
by
our
army
we
saw
hundreds
of
prisoners
massacred
in
cold
blood
at
fort
pillow
and
the
midnight
sack
of
lawrence
and
the
murder
of
its
principal
citizens
the
flames
of
our
merchant
vessels
seized
by
pirates
lighted
every
sea
we
heard
of
officers
of
the
rebel
army
and
navy
stealing
into
our
cities
firing
hotels
filled
with
sleeping
occupants
and
laying
obstructions
on
the
track
of
rail
cars
for
the
purpose
of
killing
and
mangling
their
passengers
yet
in
spite
of
these
revelations
of
the
utterly
barbarous
character
of
slavery
and
its
direful
effect
upon
all
connected
with
it
we
were
on
the
very
point
of
trusting
to
its
most
criminal
defenders
the
task
of
reestablishing
the
state
governments
of
the
south
leaving
the
real
union
men
white
as
well
as
black
at
the
mercy
of
those
who
have
made
hatred
a
religion
and
murder
a
sacrament
the
nation
needed
one
more
terrible
lesson
it
has
it
in
the
murder
of
its
beloved
chief
magistrate
and
the
attempted
assassination
of
its
honored
prime
minister
the
two
men
of
all
others
prepared
to
go
farthest
to
smooth
the
way
of
defeated
rebellion
back
to
allegiance
even
now
the
lesson
of
these
terrible
events
seems
but
half
learned
in
the
public
utterances
i
hear
much
of
punishing
and
hanging
leading
traitors
fierce
demands
for
vengeance
and
threats
of
the
summary
chastisement
of
domestic
sympathizers
with
treason
but
comparatively
little
is
said
of
the
accursed
cause
the
prolific
mother
of
abominations
slavery
the
government
is
exhorted
to
remember
that
it
does
not
bear
the
sword
in
vain
the
old
testament
is
ransacked
for
texts
of
oriental
hatred
and
examples
of
the
revenges
of
a
nation
but
as
respects
the
four
millions
of
unmistakably
loyal
people
of
the
south
the
patient
the
victims
of
oppressions
only
here
and
there
a
voice
pleads
for
their
endowment
with
the
same
rights
of
citizenship
which
are
to
be
accorded
to
the
rank
and
file
of
disbanded
rebels
the
golden
rule
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
is
not
applied
to
them
much
is
said
of
executing
justice
upon
rebels
little
of
justice
to
loyal
black
men
hanging
a
few
ringleaders
of
treason
it
seems
to
be
supposed
is
all
that
is
needed
to
restore
and
reestablish
the
revolted
states
the
negro
is
to
be
left
powerless
in
the
hands
of
the
white
trash
who
hate
him
with
a
bitter
hatred
exceeding
that
of
the
large
in
short
four
years
of
terrible
chastisement
of
god
unmistakable
judgments
have
not
taught
us
as
a
people
their
lesson
which
could
scarcely
be
plainer
if
it
had
been
written
in
letters
of
fire
on
the
sky
why
is
it
that
we
are
so
slow
to
learn
so
unwilling
to
confess
that
slavery
is
the
accursed
thing
which
whets
the
knife
of
murder
and
transforms
men
with
the
exterior
of
gentlemen
and
christians
into
fiends
how
pitiful
is
our
exultation
over
the
capture
of
the
wretched
booth
and
his
associates
the
great
criminal
of
whom
he
and
they
were
but
paltry
instruments
still
stalks
abroad
in
the
pine
woods
of
jersey
where
the
state
has
thrown
around
him
her
legislative
sanction
and
protection
he
is
in
pennsylvania
thrusting
the
black
man
from
public
conveyances
wherever
god
children
are
despised
insulted
and
abused
on
account
of
their
color
there
is
the
real
assassin
of
the
president
still
at
large
i
do
not
wonder
at
the
indignation
which
has
been
awakened
by
the
late
outrage
for
i
have
painfully
shared
it
but
let
us
see
to
it
that
it
is
rightly
directed
the
hanging
of
a
score
of
southern
traitors
will
not
restore
abraham
lincoln
nor
atone
for
the
mighty
loss
in
wreaking
revenge
upon
these
miserable
men
we
must
see
to
it
that
we
do
not
degrade
ourselves
and
do
dishonor
to
the
sacred
memory
of
the
dead
we
do
well
to
be
angry
and
if
need
be
let
our
wrath
wax
seven
times
hotter
until
that
which
was
a
murderer
from
the
beginning
is
consumed
from
the
face
of
the
earth
as
the
people
stand
by
the
grave
of
lincoln
let
them
lift
their
right
hands
to
heaven
and
take
a
solemn
vow
upon
their
souls
to
give
no
sleep
to
their
eyes
nor
slumber
to
their
eyelids
until
slavery
is
hunted
from
its
last
shelter
and
every
man
black
and
white
stands
equal
before
the
law
in
dealing
with
the
guilty
leaders
and
instigators
of
the
rebellion
we
should
beware
how
we
take
counsel
of
passion
hatred
has
no
place
beside
the
calm
and
awful
dignity
of
justice
human
life
is
still
a
very
sacred
thing
christian
forbearance
and
patience
are
still
virtues
for
my
own
part
i
should
be
satisfied
to
see
the
chiefs
of
the
great
treason
go
out
from
among
us
homeless
exiled
with
the
mark
of
cain
on
their
foreheads
carrying
with
them
wherever
they
go
the
avenging
nemesis
of
conscience
we
can
not
take
lessons
at
this
late
day
in
their
school
of
barbarism
we
can
not
starve
and
torture
them
as
they
have
starved
and
tortured
our
soldiers
let
them
live
perhaps
that
is
after
all
the
most
terrible
penalty
for
wherever
they
hide
themselves
the
story
of
their
acts
will
pursue
them
they
can
have
no
rest
nor
peace
save
in
that
deep
repentance
which
through
the
mercy
of
god
is
possible
for
all
i
have
no
disposition
to
stand
between
these
men
and
justice
if
arrested
they
can
have
no
claim
to
exemption
from
the
liabilities
of
criminals
but
it
is
not
simply
a
question
of
deserts
that
is
to
be
considered
we
are
to
take
into
account
our
own
reputation
as
a
christian
people
the
wishes
of
our
best
friends
abroad
and
the
humane
instincts
of
the
age
which
forbid
all
unnecessary
severity
happily
we
are
not
called
upon
to
take
counsel
of
our
fears
rabbinical
writers
tell
us
that
evil
spirits
who
are
once
baffled
in
a
contest
with
human
beings
lose
from
thenceforth
all
power
of
further
mischief
the
defeated
rebels
are
in
the
precise
condition
of
these
jewish
demons
deprived
of
slavery
they
are
like
wasps
that
have
lost
their
stings
as
respects
the
misguided
masses
of
the
south
the
shattered
and
crippled
remnants
of
the
armies
of
treason
the
desolate
wives
mothers
and
children
mourning
for
dear
ones
who
have
fallen
in
a
vain
and
hopeless
struggle
it
seems
to
me
our
duty
is
very
plain
we
must
forgive
their
past
treason
and
welcome
and
encourage
their
returning
loyalty
none
but
cowards
will
insult
and
taunt
the
defeated
and
defenceless
we
must
feed
and
clothe
the
destitute
instruct
the
ignorant
and
bearing
patiently
with
the
bitterness
and
prejudice
which
will
doubtless
for
a
time
thwart
our
efforts
and
misinterpret
our
motives
aid
them
in
rebuilding
their
states
on
the
foundation
of
freedom
our
sole
enemy
was
slavery
and
slavery
is
dead
we
have
now
no
quarrel
with
the
people
of
the
south
who
have
really
more
reason
than
we
have
to
rejoice
over
the
downfall
of
a
system
which
impeded
their
material
progress
perverted
their
religion
shut
them
out
from
the
sympathies
of
the
world
and
ridged
their
land
with
the
graves
of
its
victims
we
are
victors
the
cause
of
all
this
evil
and
suffering
is
removed
forever
and
we
can
well
afford
to
be
magnanimous
how
better
can
we
evince
our
gratitude
to
god
for
his
great
mercy
than
in
doing
good
to
those
who
hated
us
and
in
having
compassion
on
those
who
have
despitefully
used
us
the
hour
is
hastening
for
us
all
when
our
sole
ground
of
dependence
will
be
the
mercy
and
forgiveness
of
god
let
us
endeavor
so
to
feel
and
act
in
our
relations
to
the
people
of
the
south
that
we
can
repeat
in
sincerity
the
prayer
of
our
lord
forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
those
who
trespass
against
us
reverently
acknowledging
that
he
has
indeed
led
captivity
captive
and
received
gifts
for
men
yea
for
the
rebellious
also
that
the
lord
god
might
dwell
among
them
charles
sumner
and
the
the
wise
reticence
of
the
president
elect
in
the
matter
of
his
cabinet
has
left
free
course
to
speculation
and
conjecture
as
to
its
composition
that
he
fully
comprehends
the
importance
of
the
subject
and
that
he
will
carefully
weigh
the
claims
of
the
possible
candidates
on
the
score
of
patriotic
services
ability
and
fitness
for
specific
duties
no
one
who
has
studied
his
character
and
witnessed
his
discretion
clear
insight
and
wise
adaptation
of
means
to
ends
under
the
mighty
responsibilities
of
his
past
career
can
reasonably
doubt
it
is
not
probable
that
the
distinguished
statesman
now
at
the
head
of
the
state
department
will
under
the
circumstances
look
for
a
continuance
in
office
history
will
do
justice
to
his
eminent
services
in
the
senate
and
in
the
cabinet
during
the
first
years
of
the
rebellion
but
the
fact
that
he
has
to
some
extent
shared
the
unpopularity
of
the
present
chief
magistrate
seems
to
preclude
the
idea
of
his
retention
in
the
new
cabinet
in
looking
over
the
list
of
our
public
men
in
search
of
a
successor
general
grant
is
not
likely
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
number
of
individuals
fitted
by
nature
culture
and
experience
for
such
an
important
post
the
newspaper
press
in
its
wide
license
of
conjecture
and
suggestion
has
as
far
as
i
have
seen
mentioned
but
three
or
four
names
in
this
connection
allusions
have
been
made
to
senator
fessenden
of
maine
motley
general
dix
stanton
and
charles
sumner
of
massachusetts
without
disparaging
in
any
degree
his
assumed
competitors
the
gentleman
is
unquestionably
preeminently
fitted
for
the
place
he
has
had
a
lifelong
education
for
it
the
entire
cast
of
his
mind
the
bent
of
his
studies
the
habit
and
experience
of
his
public
life
his
profound
knowledge
of
international
law
and
the
diplomatic
history
of
his
own
and
other
countries
his
reputation
as
a
statesman
and
constitutional
lawyer
not
only
at
home
but
wherever
our
country
has
relations
of
amity
and
commerce
the
honorable
distinction
which
he
enjoys
of
having
held
a
foremost
place
in
the
great
conflict
between
freedom
and
slavery
union
and
rebellion
all
mark
him
as
the
man
for
the
occasion
there
seems
indeed
a
certain
propriety
in
assigning
to
the
man
who
struck
the
heaviest
blows
at
secession
and
slavery
in
the
national
senate
the
first
place
under
him
who
in
the
field
made
them
henceforth
impossible
the
great
captain
and
the
great
senator
united
in
war
should
not
be
dissevered
in
peace
i
am
not
unaware
that
there
are
some
even
in
the
republican
party
who
have
failed
to
recognize
in
senator
sumner
the
really
wise
and
practical
statesmanship
which
a
careful
review
of
his
public
labors
can
not
but
make
manifest
it
is
only
necessary
to
point
such
to
the
open
record
of
his
senatorial
career
few
men
have
had
the
honor
of
introducing
and
defending
with
exhaustive
ability
and
thoroughness
so
many
measures
of
acknowledged
practical
importance
to
his
imrnedicte
constituents
the
country
at
large
and
the
wider
interests
of
humanity
and
civilization
in
what
exigency
has
he
been
found
wanting
what
legislative
act
of
public
utility
for
the
last
eighteen
years
has
lacked
his
encouragement
at
the
head
of
the
committee
on
foreign
affairs
his
clearness
of
vision
firmness
moderation
and
ready
comprehension
of
the
duties
of
his
time
and
place
must
be
admitted
by
all
parties
it
was
shrewdly
said
by
burke
that
men
are
wise
with
little
reflection
and
good
with
little
denial
in
business
of
all
times
except
their
own
but
charles
sumner
the
scholar
loving
the
still
air
of
delightful
studies
has
shown
himself
as
capable
of
thoroughly
comprehending
and
digesting
the
events
transpiring
before
his
eyes
as
of
pronouncing
judgment
upon
those
recorded
in
history
far
in
advance
of
most
of
his
contemporaries
he
saw
and
enunciated
the
true
doctrine
of
reconstruction
the
early
adoption
of
which
would
have
been
of
incalculable
service
to
the
country
one
of
the
ablest
statesmen
and
jurists
of
the
democratic
party
has
had
the
rare
magnanimity
to
acknowledge
that
in
this
matter
the
republican
senator
was
right
and
himself
and
his
party
wrong
the
republicans
of
massachusetts
will
make
no
fractious
or
importunate
demand
upon
the
new
president
they
are
content
to
leave
to
his
unbiased
and
impartial
judgment
the
selection
of
his
cabinet
but
if
looking
to
the
best
interests
of
the
country
he
shall
see
fit
to
give
their
distinguished
the
first
place
in
it
they
will
feel
no
solicitude
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
duties
of
the
office
will
be
discharged
they
will
feel
that
the
tools
are
with
him
who
can
use
them
nothing
more
directly
affects
the
reputation
of
a
country
than
the
character
of
its
diplomatic
correspondence
and
its
foreign
representatives
we
have
suffered
in
times
past
from
sad
mismanagement
abroad
and
intelligent
americans
have
too
often
been
compelled
to
hang
their
heads
with
shame
to
see
the
flag
of
their
country
floating
over
the
consular
offices
of
worthless
incompetent
agents
there
can
be
no
question
that
so
far
as
they
are
entrusted
to
senator
sumner
hands
the
interest
honor
and
dignity
of
the
nation
will
be
safe
in
a
few
weeks
charles
summer
will
be
returned
for
his
fourth
term
in
the
united
states
senate
by
the
unanimous
vote
of
both
branches
of
the
legislature
of
massachusetts
not
a
syllable
of
opposition
to
his
reelection
is
heard
from
any
quarter
there
is
not
a
republican
in
the
legislature
who
could
have
been
elected
unless
he
had
been
virtually
pledged
to
his
support
no
stronger
evidence
of
the
popular
estimate
of
his
ability
and
integrity
than
this
could
be
offered
as
a
matter
of
course
the
marked
individuality
of
his
intense
convictions
earnestness
persistence
and
confident
reliance
upon
the
justice
of
his
conclusions
naturally
growing
out
of
the
consciousness
of
having
brought
to
his
honest
search
after
truth
all
the
lights
of
his
learning
and
experience
may
at
times
have
brought
him
into
unpleasant
relations
with
some
of
his
colleagues
but
no
one
friend
or
foe
has
questioned
his
ability
and
patriotism
or
doubted
his
fidelity
to
principle
he
has
lent
himself
to
no
schemes
of
greed
while
so
many
others
have
taken
advantage
of
the
facilities
of
their
official
stations
to
fill
directly
or
indirectly
their
own
pockets
or
those
of
their
relatives
and
retainers
it
is
to
the
honor
of
massachusetts
that
her
representatives
in
the
senate
have
not
only
shaken
their
hands
from
the
holding
of
bribes
but
have
so
borne
themselves
that
no
shadow
of
suspicion
has
ever
rested
on
them
in
this
connection
it
may
be
proper
to
state
that
in
the
event
of
a
change
in
the
war
department
the
claims
of
general
wilson
to
whose
services
in
the
committee
on
military
affairs
the
country
is
deeply
indebted
may
be
brought
under
consideration
in
that
case
massachusetts
would
not
if
it
were
in
her
power
discriminate
between
her
senators
both
have
deserved
well
of
her
and
of
the
country
in
expressing
thus
briefly
my
opinion
i
do
not
forget
that
after
all
the
choice
and
responsibility
rest
with
general
grant
alone
there
i
am
content
to
leave
them
i
am
very
far
from
urging
any
sectional
claim
let
the
country
but
have
peace
after
its
long
discord
let
its
good
faith
and
financial
credit
be
sustained
and
all
classes
of
its
citizens
everywhere
protected
in
person
and
estate
and
it
matters
very
little
to
me
whether
massachusetts
is
represented
at
the
executive
council
board
or
not
personally
charles
sumner
would
gain
nothing
by
a
transfer
from
the
senate
chamber
to
the
state
department
he
does
not
need
a
place
in
the
american
cabinet
any
more
than
john
bright
does
in
the
british
the
highest
ambition
might
well
be
satisfied
with
his
present
position
from
which
looking
back
upon
an
honorable
record
he
might
be
justified
in
using
milton
language
of
lofty
confidence
in
the
reply
to
salmasius
i
am
not
one
who
has
disgraced
beauty
of
sentiment
by
deformity
of
conduct
or
the
maxims
of
a
freeman
by
the
actions
of
a
slave
but
by
the
grace
of
god
i
have
kept
my
life
unsullied
the
presidential
election
of
the
following
letter
was
written
on
receiving
a
request
from
a
committee
of
colored
voters
for
advice
as
to
their
action
at
the
presidential
election
of
amesbury
mo
dear
friends
i
have
just
received
your
letter
of
the
ult
asking
my
opinion
of
your
present
duty
as
colored
voters
in
the
choice
between
general
grant
and
horace
greeley
for
the
presidency
you
state
that
you
have
been
confused
by
the
contradictory
advice
given
you
by
such
friends
of
your
people
as
charles
sumner
on
one
hand
and
william
garrison
and
wendell
phillips
on
the
other
and
you
ask
me
as
one
whom
you
are
pleased
to
think
free
from
all
bias
to
add
my
counsel
to
theirs
i
thank
you
for
the
very
kind
expression
of
your
confidence
and
your
generous
reference
to
my
endeavors
to
serve
the
cause
of
freedom
but
i
must
own
that
i
would
fain
have
been
spared
the
necessity
of
adding
to
the
already
too
long
list
of
political
epistles
i
have
felt
it
my
duty
in
times
past
to
take
an
active
part
often
very
distasteful
to
me
in
political
matters
having
for
my
first
object
the
deliverance
of
my
country
from
the
crime
and
curse
of
slavery
that
great
question
being
now
settled
forever
i
have
been
more
than
willing
to
leave
to
younger
and
stronger
hands
the
toils
and
the
honors
of
partisan
service
pained
and
saddened
by
the
bitter
and
unchristian
personalities
of
the
canvass
now
in
progress
i
have
hitherto
held
myself
aloof
from
it
as
far
as
possible
unwilling
to
sanction
in
the
slightest
degree
the
criminations
and
recriminations
of
personal
friends
whom
i
have
every
reason
to
love
and
respect
and
in
whose
integrity
i
have
unshaken
confidence
in
the
present
condition
of
affairs
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
that
any
special
action
as
an
abolitionist
was
required
at
my
hands
both
of
the
great
parties
heretofore
widely
separated
have
put
themselves
on
substantially
the
same
platform
the
republican
party
originally
pledged
only
to
the
of
slavery
and
whose
most
illustrious
representative
president
lincoln
avowed
his
willingness
to
save
the
union
without
abolishing
slavery
has
been
under
providence
mainly
instrumental
in
the
total
overthrow
of
the
detestable
system
while
the
democratic
party
composed
largely
of
and
even
at
the
north
scarcely
willing
to
save
the
union
at
the
expense
of
the
slave
interest
upon
which
its
success
depended
shattered
and
crippled
by
the
civil
war
and
its
results
has
at
last
yielded
to
the
inexorable
logic
of
events
abandoned
a
position
no
longer
tenable
and
taken
its
new
departure
with
an
abolitionist
as
its
candidate
as
a
friend
of
the
colored
man
and
for
the
sake
of
the
peace
and
prosperity
of
the
country
i
rejoice
at
this
action
of
the
democratic
party
the
underlying
motives
of
this
radical
change
are
doubtless
somewhat
mixed
and
contradictory
honest
conviction
on
the
part
of
some
and
party
expediency
and
desire
of
office
on
the
part
of
others
but
the
change
itself
is
real
and
irrevocable
the
penalty
of
receding
would
be
swift
and
irretrievable
ruin
in
any
point
of
view
the
new
order
of
things
is
desirable
and
nothing
more
fully
illustrates
the
ways
that
are
dark
and
the
tricks
that
are
vain
of
party
politics
than
the
attempt
of
professed
friends
of
the
union
and
equal
rights
for
all
to
counteract
it
by
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
a
revival
of
the
worst
characteristics
of
the
old
party
in
the
shape
of
a
democratic
convention
as
respects
the
candidates
now
before
us
i
can
see
no
good
reason
why
colored
voters
as
such
should
oppose
general
grant
who
though
not
an
abolitionist
and
not
even
a
member
of
the
republican
party
previous
to
his
nomination
has
faithfully
carried
out
the
laws
of
congress
in
their
behalf
nor
on
the
other
hand
can
i
see
any
just
grounds
for
distrust
of
such
a
man
as
horace
greeley
who
has
so
nobly
distinguished
himself
as
the
advocate
of
human
rights
irrespective
of
race
or
color
and
who
by
the
instrumentality
of
his
press
has
been
for
thirty
years
the
educator
of
the
people
in
the
principles
of
justice
temperance
and
freedom
both
of
these
men
have
in
different
ways
deserved
too
well
of
the
country
to
be
unnecessarily
subjected
to
the
brutalities
of
a
presidential
canvass
and
so
far
as
they
are
personally
concerned
it
would
doubtless
have
been
better
if
the
one
had
declined
a
second
term
of
uncongenial
duties
and
the
other
continued
to
indite
words
of
wisdom
in
the
shades
of
chappaqua
but
they
have
chosen
otherwise
and
i
am
willing
for
one
to
leave
my
colored
to
the
unbiased
exercise
of
their
own
judgment
and
instincts
in
deciding
between
them
the
democratic
party
labors
under
the
disadvantage
of
antecedents
not
calculated
to
promote
a
rapid
growth
of
confidence
and
it
is
no
matter
of
surprise
that
the
vote
of
the
emancipated
class
is
likely
to
be
largely
against
it
but
if
as
will
doubtless
be
the
case
that
vote
shall
be
to
some
extent
divided
between
the
two
candidates
it
will
have
the
effect
of
inducing
politicians
of
the
rival
parties
to
treat
with
respect
and
consideration
this
new
element
of
political
power
from
interest
if
from
no
higher
motive
the
fact
that
at
this
time
both
parties
are
welcoming
colored
orators
to
their
platforms
and
that
in
the
south
old
and
their
former
slaves
fraternize
at
caucus
and
barbecue
and
vote
for
each
other
at
the
polls
is
full
of
significance
if
in
new
england
the
very
men
who
thrust
frederick
douglass
from
car
and
and
mobbed
and
hunted
him
like
a
wild
beast
now
crowd
to
shake
his
hand
and
cheer
him
let
us
not
despair
of
seeing
even
the
tarried
into
decency
and
sitting
clothed
in
their
right
minds
as
listeners
to
their
former
victims
the
colored
man
is
the
master
of
his
own
destiny
no
power
on
earth
can
deprive
him
of
his
rights
as
an
american
citizen
and
it
is
in
the
light
of
american
citizenship
that
i
choose
to
regard
my
colored
friends
as
men
having
a
common
stake
in
the
welfare
of
the
country
mingled
with
and
not
separate
from
their
white
not
herded
together
as
a
distinct
class
to
be
wielded
by
others
without
and
incapable
of
thanks
to
such
men
as
sumner
and
wilson
and
their
compeers
nearly
all
that
legislation
can
do
for
them
has
already
been
done
we
can
now
only
help
them
to
help
themselves
industry
economy
temperance
education
for
their
children
these
things
indispensable
to
their
elevation
and
progress
are
in
a
great
measure
in
their
own
hands
you
will
therefore
my
friends
and
pardon
me
if
i
decline
to
undertake
to
decide
for
you
the
question
of
your
political
duty
as
respects
the
candidates
for
the
presidency
a
question
which
you
have
probably
already
settled
in
your
own
minds
if
it
had
been
apparent
to
me
that
your
rights
and
liberties
were
really
in
danger
from
the
success
of
either
candidate
your
letter
would
not
have
been
needed
to
call
forth
my
opinion
in
the
long
struggle
of
forty
years
i
can
honestly
say
that
no
consideration
of
private
interest
nor
my
natural
love
of
peace
and
retirement
and
the
of
others
have
kept
me
silent
when
a
word
could
be
fitly
spoken
for
human
rights
i
have
not
so
long
acted
with
the
class
to
which
you
belong
without
acquiring
respect
for
your
intelligence
and
capacity
for
judging
wisely
for
yourselves
i
shall
abide
your
decision
with
confidence
and
cheerfully
acquiesce
in
it
if
on
the
whole
you
prefer
to
vote
for
the
reelection
of
general
grant
let
me
hope
you
will
do
so
without
joining
with
friends
in
denouncing
and
reviling
such
an
old
and
tried
friend
as
charles
sumner
who
has
done
and
suffered
so
much
in
your
behalf
if
on
the
other
hand
some
of
you
decide
to
vote
for
horace
greeley
you
need
not
in
so
doing
forget
your
great
obligations
to
such
friends
as
william
lloyd
garrison
wendell
phillips
and
lydia
maria
child
agree
or
disagree
with
them
take
their
advice
or
reject
it
but
stand
by
them
still
and
teach
the
parties
with
which
you
are
connected
to
respect
your
feelings
towards
your
benefactors
the
censure
of
sumner
a
letter
to
the
boston
daily
advertiser
in
reference
to
the
petition
for
the
rescinding
of
the
resolutions
censuring
senator
sumner
for
his
motion
to
erase
from
the
united
states
flags
the
record
of
the
battles
of
the
civil
war
i
beg
leave
to
occupy
a
small
space
in
the
columns
of
the
advertiser
for
the
purpose
of
noticing
a
charge
which
has
been
brought
against
the
petitioners
for
rescinding
the
resolutions
of
the
late
extra
session
virtually
censuring
the
hon
charles
sumner
it
is
intimated
that
the
action
of
these
petitioners
evinces
a
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
services
of
the
soldiers
of
the
union
and
that
not
to
censure
charles
sumner
is
to
censure
the
volunteers
of
massachusetts
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
petitioners
express
no
opinion
as
to
the
policy
or
expediency
of
the
senator
proposition
some
may
believe
it
not
only
right
in
itself
but
expedient
and
others
that
it
was
inexpedient
or
premature
none
doubt
that
sooner
or
later
the
thing
which
it
contemplates
must
be
done
if
we
are
to
continue
a
united
people
what
they
feel
and
insist
upon
is
that
the
proposition
is
one
which
implies
no
disparagement
of
the
soldiers
of
massachusetts
and
the
union
that
it
neither
receives
nor
merits
the
unqualified
condemnation
of
the
people
of
the
state
and
that
it
furnishes
no
ground
whatever
for
legislative
interference
or
censure
a
single
glance
at
the
names
of
the
petitioners
is
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
insinuation
that
they
are
unmindful
of
that
and
devotion
the
marble
and
granite
memorials
of
which
dotting
the
state
from
the
merrimac
to
the
connecticut
testify
the
gratitude
of
the
loyal
heart
of
massachusetts
i
have
seen
no
soldier
yet
who
considered
himself
wronged
or
insulted
by
the
proposition
in
point
of
fact
the
soldiers
have
never
asked
for
such
censure
of
the
brave
and
loyal
statesman
who
was
the
bosom
friend
and
confidant
of
secretary
stanton
the
great
second
if
at
all
only
to
carnot
and
of
john
andrew
dear
to
the
heart
of
every
massachusetts
soldier
and
whose
tender
care
and
sympathy
reached
them
wherever
they
struggled
or
died
for
country
and
freedom
the
proposal
of
senator
sumner
instead
of
being
an
insult
was
in
fact
the
highest
compliment
which
could
be
paid
to
brave
men
for
it
implied
that
they
cherished
no
vindictive
hatred
of
fallen
foes
that
they
were
too
proudly
secure
of
the
love
and
gratitude
of
their
countrymen
to
need
above
their
heads
the
flaunting
blazon
of
their
achievements
that
they
were
as
magnanimous
in
peace
and
victory
as
they
were
heroic
and
patient
through
the
dark
and
doubtful
arbitrament
of
war
as
such
they
understand
it
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
there
existed
a
single
son
of
massachusetts
weak
enough
to
believe
that
his
reputation
and
honor
as
a
soldier
needed
this
censure
of
charles
sumner
i
have
before
me
letters
from
men
ranking
from
orderly
sergeant
to
general
who
have
looked
at
death
full
in
the
face
on
every
battlefield
where
the
flag
of
massachusetts
floated
and
they
all
thank
me
for
my
efforts
to
rescind
this
censure
and
pledge
me
their
hearty
support
they
cordially
indorse
the
noble
letter
of
wilson
offering
his
signature
to
the
petition
for
rescinding
the
obnoxious
resolutions
and
if
these
resolutions
are
not
annulled
it
will
not
be
the
fault
of
massachusetts
volunteers
but
rather
of
the
mistaken
zeal
of
men
more
familiar
with
the
drill
of
the
caucus
than
with
that
of
the
camp
i
am
no
blind
partisan
of
charles
sumner
i
have
often
differed
from
him
in
opinion
i
regretted
deeply
the
position
which
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
take
during
the
late
presidential
campaign
he
felt
the
atmosphere
about
him
thick
and
foul
with
corruption
and
bribery
and
greed
he
saw
the
treasury
ringed
about
like
saturn
with
unscrupulous
combinations
and
corporations
and
it
is
to
be
regretted
more
than
wondered
at
if
he
struck
out
wildly
in
his
indignation
and
that
his
blows
fell
sometimes
upon
the
wrong
object
but
i
did
not
intend
to
act
the
part
of
his
apologist
the
twenty
years
of
his
senatorial
life
are
crowded
with
memorials
of
his
loyalty
to
truth
and
free
dom
and
humanity
which
will
be
enduring
as
our
history
he
is
no
party
to
this
movement
in
which
my
name
has
been
more
prominent
than
i
could
have
wished
and
no
word
of
his
prompted
or
suggested
it
from
its
inception
to
the
present
time
he
has
remained
silent
in
his
chamber
of
pain
waiting
to
bequeath
like
the
testator
of
the
dramatist
a
fame
by
scandal
untouched
to
memory
and
time
old
daughter
truth
he
can
well
afford
to
wait
and
the
issue
of
the
present
question
before
our
legislature
is
of
far
less
consequence
to
him
than
to
us
to
use
the
words
of
one
who
stood
by
him
in
the
dark
days
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
time
and
the
wiser
thought
will
vindicate
the
illustrious
statesman
to
whom
massachusetts
the
country
and
humanity
owe
so
much
but
the
state
can
ill
afford
the
damage
to
its
own
reputation
which
such
a
censure
of
such
a
man
will
inflict
amesbury
month
the
convention
of
in
the
gray
twilight
of
a
chill
day
of
late
november
forty
years
ago
a
dear
friend
of
mine
residing
in
boston
made
his
appearance
at
the
old
in
east
haverhill
he
had
been
deputed
by
the
abolitionists
of
the
city
william
garrison
samuel
sewall
and
others
to
inform
me
of
my
appointment
as
a
delegate
to
the
convention
about
to
be
held
in
philadelphia
for
the
formation
of
an
american
society
and
to
urge
upon
me
the
necessity
of
my
attendance
few
words
of
persuasion
however
were
needed
i
was
unused
to
travelling
my
life
had
been
spent
on
a
secluded
farm
and
the
journey
mostly
by
at
that
time
was
really
a
formidable
one
moreover
the
few
abolitionists
were
everywhere
spoken
against
their
persons
threatened
and
in
some
instances
a
price
set
on
their
heads
by
southern
legislators
pennsylvania
was
on
the
borders
of
slavery
and
it
needed
small
effort
of
imagination
to
picture
to
one
self
the
breaking
up
of
the
convention
and
maltreatment
of
its
members
this
latter
consideration
i
do
not
think
weighed
much
with
me
although
i
was
better
prepared
for
serious
danger
than
for
anything
like
personal
indignity
i
had
read
governor
trumbull
description
of
the
tarring
and
feathering
of
his
hero
macfingal
when
after
the
application
of
the
melted
tar
the
was
ripped
open
and
shaken
over
him
until
not
maia
son
with
wings
for
ears
such
plumes
about
his
visage
wears
nor
milton
angel
gathers
such
superfluity
of
feathers
and
i
confess
i
was
quite
unwilling
to
undergo
a
martyrdom
which
my
best
friends
could
scarcely
refrain
from
laughing
at
but
a
summons
like
that
of
garrison
could
scarcely
be
unheeded
by
one
who
from
birth
and
education
held
fast
the
traditions
of
that
earlier
abolitionism
which
under
the
lead
of
benezet
and
woolman
had
effaced
from
the
society
of
friends
every
vestige
of
i
had
thrown
myself
with
a
young
man
fervid
enthusiasm
into
a
movement
which
commended
itself
to
my
reason
and
conscience
to
my
love
of
country
and
my
sense
of
duty
to
god
and
my
my
first
venture
in
authorship
was
the
publication
at
my
own
expense
in
the
spring
of
of
a
pamphlet
entitled
justice
and
expediency
on
the
moral
and
political
evils
of
slavery
and
the
duty
of
emancipation
under
such
circumstances
i
could
not
hesitate
but
prepared
at
once
for
my
journey
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
start
on
the
morrow
and
the
intervening
time
with
a
small
allowance
for
sleep
was
spent
in
providing
for
the
care
of
the
farm
and
homestead
during
my
absence
so
the
next
morning
i
took
the
stage
for
boston
stopping
at
the
ancient
hostelry
known
as
the
eastern
stage
tavern
and
on
the
day
following
in
company
with
william
lloyd
garrison
i
left
for
new
york
at
that
city
we
were
joined
by
other
delegates
among
them
david
thurston
a
congregational
minister
from
maine
on
our
way
to
philadelphia
we
took
as
a
matter
of
necessary
economy
a
conveyance
and
found
ourselves
in
consequence
among
rough
and
hilarious
companions
whose
language
was
more
noteworthy
for
strength
than
refinement
our
worthy
friend
the
clergyman
bore
it
awhile
in
painful
silence
but
at
last
felt
it
his
duty
to
utter
words
of
remonstrance
and
admonition
the
leader
of
the
young
roisterers
listened
with
a
ludicrous
mock
gravity
thanked
him
for
his
exhortation
and
expressing
fears
that
the
extraordinary
effort
had
exhausted
his
strength
invited
him
to
take
a
drink
with
him
father
thurston
buried
his
grieved
face
in
his
and
wisely
left
the
young
reprobates
to
their
own
devices
on
reaching
philadelphia
we
at
once
betook
ourselves
to
the
humble
dwelling
on
fifth
street
occupied
by
evan
lewis
a
plain
earnest
man
and
lifelong
abolitionist
who
had
been
largely
interested
in
preparing
the
way
for
the
convention
in
one
respect
the
time
of
our
assembling
seemed
unfavorable
the
society
of
friends
upon
whose
cooperation
we
had
counted
had
but
recently
been
rent
asunder
by
one
of
those
unhappy
controversies
which
so
often
mark
the
decline
of
practical
righteousness
the
of
the
society
had
passed
wealth
and
luxury
had
taken
the
place
of
the
old
simplicity
there
was
a
growing
conformity
to
the
maxims
of
the
world
in
trade
and
fashion
and
with
it
a
corresponding
unwillingness
to
hazard
respectability
by
the
advocacy
of
unpopular
reforms
unprofitable
speculation
and
disputation
on
one
hand
and
a
vain
attempt
on
the
other
to
enforce
uniformity
of
opinion
had
measurably
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
end
of
the
gospel
is
love
and
that
charity
is
its
crowning
virtue
after
a
long
and
painful
struggle
the
disruption
had
taken
place
the
shattered
fragments
under
the
name
of
orthodox
and
hicksite
so
like
and
yet
so
separate
in
feeling
confronted
each
other
as
hostile
sects
and
never
either
found
another
to
free
the
hollow
heart
from
paining
they
stood
aloof
the
scars
remaining
like
cliffs
that
have
been
torn
asunder
a
dreary
sea
now
flows
between
but
neither
rain
nor
frost
nor
thunder
can
wholly
do
away
i
ween
the
marks
of
that
which
once
has
been
we
found
about
forty
members
assembled
in
the
parlors
of
our
friend
lewis
and
after
some
general
conversation
lewis
tappan
was
asked
to
preside
over
an
informal
meeting
preparatory
to
the
opening
of
the
convention
a
handsome
man
in
the
prime
of
life
responded
to
the
invitation
and
in
a
clear
voice
the
firm
tones
of
which
inspired
hope
and
confidence
stated
the
objects
of
our
preliminary
council
and
the
purpose
which
had
called
us
together
in
earnest
and
words
in
making
arrangements
for
the
convention
it
was
thought
expedient
to
secure
if
possible
the
services
of
some
citizen
of
philadelphia
of
distinction
and
high
social
standing
to
preside
over
its
deliberations
looking
round
among
ourselves
in
vain
for
some
titled
civilian
or
doctor
of
divinity
we
were
fain
to
confess
that
to
outward
seeming
we
were
but
a
feeble
folk
sorely
needing
the
shield
of
a
popular
name
a
committee
of
which
i
was
a
member
was
appointed
to
go
in
search
of
a
president
of
this
description
we
visited
two
prominent
gentlemen
known
as
friendly
to
emancipation
and
of
high
social
standing
they
received
us
with
the
dignified
courtesy
of
the
old
school
declined
our
proposition
in
civil
terms
and
bowed
us
out
with
a
cool
politeness
equalled
only
by
that
of
the
senior
winkle
towards
the
unlucky
deputation
of
pickwick
and
his
unprepossessing
companions
as
we
left
their
doors
we
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
in
each
other
faces
at
the
thought
of
the
small
inducement
our
proffer
of
the
presidency
held
out
to
men
of
their
class
evidently
our
company
was
not
one
for
respectability
to
march
through
coventry
with
on
the
following
morning
we
repaired
to
the
adelphi
building
on
fifth
street
below
walnut
which
had
been
secured
for
our
use
delegates
were
found
to
be
in
attendance
beriah
green
of
the
oneida
new
york
institute
was
chosen
president
a
rather
man
but
who
had
the
reputation
of
an
able
and
eloquent
speaker
he
had
already
made
himself
known
to
us
as
a
resolute
and
abolitionist
lewis
tappan
and
myself
took
our
places
at
his
side
as
secretaries
on
the
elevation
at
the
west
end
of
the
hall
looking
over
the
assembly
i
noticed
that
it
was
mainly
composed
of
comparatively
young
men
some
in
middle
age
and
a
few
beyond
that
period
they
were
nearly
all
plainly
dressed
with
a
view
to
comfort
rather
than
elegance
many
of
the
faces
turned
towards
me
wore
a
look
of
expectancy
and
suppressed
enthusiasm
all
had
the
earnestness
which
might
be
expected
of
men
engaged
in
an
enterprise
beset
with
difficulty
and
perhaps
with
peril
the
fine
intellectual
head
of
garrison
prematurely
bald
was
conspicuous
the
young
man
at
his
side
in
whom
all
the
beatitudes
seemed
to
find
expression
was
samuel
j
may
mingling
in
his
veins
the
best
blood
of
the
sewalls
and
quincys
a
man
so
exceptionally
pure
and
so
genial
tender
and
loving
that
he
could
be
faithful
to
truth
and
duty
without
making
an
enemy
the
wad
look
into
his
face
and
swear
he
couldna
wrang
him
that
tall
gaunt
swarthy
man
erect
upon
whose
somewhat
martial
figure
the
quaker
coat
seemed
a
little
out
of
place
was
lindley
coates
known
in
all
eastern
pennsylvania
as
a
stern
enemy
of
slavery
that
slight
eager
man
intensely
alive
in
every
feature
and
gesture
was
thomas
shipley
who
for
thirty
years
had
been
the
protector
of
the
free
colored
people
of
philadelphia
and
whose
name
was
whispered
reverently
in
the
slave
cabins
of
maryland
as
the
friend
of
the
black
man
one
of
a
class
peculiar
to
old
quakerism
who
in
doing
what
they
felt
to
be
duty
and
walking
as
the
light
within
guided
them
knew
no
fear
and
shrank
from
no
sacrifice
braver

world
has
not
known

in

but

of

fresh
from
his
farm
in
lancaster
county
dressed
in
plainest
homespun
his
tall
form
surmounted
by
a
shock
of
unkempt
hair
the
odd
obliquity
of
his
vision
contrasting
strongly
with
he
clearness
and
directness
of
his
spiritual
insight
elizur
wright
the
young
professor
of
a
western
college
who
had
lost
his
place
by
his
bold
advocacy
of
freedom
with
a
look
of
sharp
concentration
in
keeping
with
an
intellect
keen
as
a
damascus
blade
closely
watched
the
proceedings
through
his
spectacles
opening
his
mouth
only
to
speak
directly
to
the
purpose
the
portly
form
of
bartholomew
fussell
the
beloved
physician
from
that
beautiful
land
of
plenty
and
peace
which
bayard
taylor
has
described
in
his
story
of
kennett
was
not
to
be
overlooked
abolitionist
in
heart
and
soul
his
house
was
known
as
the
shelter
of
runaway
slaves
and
no
sportsman
ever
entered
into
the
chase
with
such
zest
as
he
did
into
the
arduous
and
sometimes
dangerous
work
of
aiding
their
escape
and
baffling
their
pursuers
the
youngest
man
present
was
i
believe
james

from

afterwards
one
of

most
efficient
workers

a
man
terribly
in

with
a
zeal
that
bordered
on
fanaticism
and
who
was
none
the
more
genial
for
the
violence
to
which

in

commendation
of

of

the
president
after
calling
james
mccrummell
one
of
the
two
or
three
colored
members
of
the
convention
to
the
chair
made
some
eloquent
remarks
upon
those
editors
who
had
ventured
to
advocate
emancipation
at
the
close
of
his
speech
a
young
man
rose
to
speak
whose
appearance
at
once
arrested
my
attention
i
think
i
have
never
seen
a
finer
face
and
figure
and
his
manner
words
and
bearing
were
in
keeping
who
is
he
i
asked
of
one
of
the
pennsylvania
delegates
robert
purvis
of
this
city
a
colored
man
was
the
answer
he
began
by
uttering
his
thanks
to
the
delegates
who
had
convened
for
the
deliverance
of
his
people
he
spoke
of
garrison
in
terms
of
warmest
eulogy
as
one
who
had
stirred
the
heart
of
the
nation
broken
the
tomblike
slumber
of
the
church
and
compelled
it
to
listen
to
the
story
of
the
slave
wrongs
he
closed
by
declaring
that
the
friends
of
colored
americans
would
not
be
forgotten
their
memories
he
said
will
be
cherished
when
pyramids
and
monuments
shall
have
crumbled
in
dust
the
flood
of
time
which
is
sweeping
away
the
refuge
of
lies

bearing
on
the
advocates
of
our
cause
to
a
glorious
immortality
the
committee
on
the
constitution
made
their
report
which
after
discussion
was
adopted
it
disclaimed
any
right
or
intention
of
interfering
otherwise
than
by
persuasion
and
christian
expostulation
with
slavery
as
it
existed
in
the
states
but
affirming
the
duty
of
congress
to
abolish
it
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
territories
and
to
put
an
end
to
the
domestic

then
chosen
arthur

president
and
elizur

william

garrison
and
cox
secretaries
among
the
was
lord
of
dartmouth
college
then
professedly
in
favor
of
emancipation
but
who
afterwards
turned
a
moral
somersault
a
which
left
him
ever
after
on
his
head
instead
of
his
feet
he
became
a
querulous
advocate
of
slavery
as
a
divine
institution
and
denounced
woe
upon
the
abolitionists
for
interfering
with
the
will
and
purpose
of
the
creator
as
the
cause
of
freedom
gained
ground
the
poor
man
heart
failed
him
and
his
hope
for
church
and
state
grew
fainter
and
fainter
a
sad
prophet
of
the
evangel
of
slavery
he
testified
in
the
unwilling
ears
of
an
unbelieving
generation
and
died
at
last
despairing
of
a
world
which
seemed
determined
that

no
longer

cursed
nor

sent
back
to
philemon
the
committee
on
the
declaration
of
principles
of
which
i
was
a
member
held
a
long
session
discussing
the
proper
scope
and
tenor
of
the
document
but
little
progress
being
made
it
was
finally
decided
to
entrust
the
matter
to
a
consisting
of
william
garrison
j
may
and
myself
and
after
a
brief
consultation
and
comparison
of
each
other
views
the
drafting
of
the
important
paper
was
assigned
to
the
former
gentleman
we
agreed
to
meet
him
at
his
lodgings
in
the
house
of
a
colored
friend
early
the
next
morning
it
was
still
dark
when
we
climbed
up
to
his
room
and
the
lamp
was
still
burning
by
the
light
of
which
he
was
writing
the
last
sentence
of
the
declaration
we
read
it
carefully
made
a
few
verbal
changes
and
submitted
it
to
the
large
committee
who
unanimously
agreed
to
report
it
to
the
convention
the
paper
was
read
to
the
convention
by
atlee
chairman
of
the
committee
and
listened
to
with
the
profoundest
interest
commencing
with
a
reference
to
the
time
years
before
when
in
the
same
city
of
philadelphia
our
fathers
announced
to
the
world
their
declaration
of
independence
based
on
the
truths
of
human
equality
and
rights
and
appealed
to
arms
for
its
defence
it
spoke
of
the
new
enterprise
as
one
without
which
that
of
our
fathers
is
incomplete
and
as
transcending
theirs
in
magnitude
solemnity
and
probable
results
as
much
as
moral
truth
does
physical
force
it
spoke
of
the
difference
of
the
two
in
the
means
and
ends
proposed
and
of
the
trifling
grievances
of
our
fathers
compared
with
the
wrongs
and
sufferings
of
the
slaves
which
it
forcibly
characterized
as
unequalled
by
any
others
on
the
face
of
the
earth
it
claimed
that
the
nation
was
bound
to
repent
at
once
to
let
the
oppressed
go
free
and
to
admit
them
to
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
others
because
it
asserted
no
man
has
a
right
to
enslave
or
imbrute
his
brother
because
liberty
is
inalienable
because
there
is
no
difference
in
principle
between
holding
and
which
the
law
brands
as
piracy
and
because
no
length
of
bondage
can
invalidate
man
claim
to
himself
or
render
slave
laws
anything
but
an
audacious
usurpation
it
maintained
that
no
compensation
should
be
given
to
planters
emancipating
slaves
because
that
would
be
a
surrender
of
fundamental
principles
slavery
is
a
crime
and
is
therefore
not
an
article
to
be
sold
because
are
not
just
proprietors
of
what
they
claim
because
emancipation
would
destroy
only
nominal
not
real
property
and
because
compensation
if
given
at
all
should
be
given
to
the
slaves
it
declared
any
scheme
of
expatriation
to
be
delusive
cruel
and
dangerous
it
fully
recognized
the
right
of
each
state
to
legislate
exclusively
on
the
subject
of
slavery
within
its
limits
and
conceded
that
congress
under
the
present
national
compact
had
no
right
to
interfere
though
still
contending
that
it
had
the
power
and
should
exercise
it
to
suppress
the
domestic
between
the
several
states
and
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
those
portions
of
our
territory
which
the
constitution
has
placed
under
its
exclusive
jurisdiction
after
clearly
and
emphatically
avowing
the
principles
underlying
the
enterprise
and
guarding
with
scrupulous
care
the
rights
of
persons
and
states
under
the
constitution
in
prosecuting
it
the
declaration
closed
with
these
eloquent
words
we
also
maintain
that
there
are
at
the
present
time
the
highest
obligations
resting
upon
the
people
of
the
free
states
to
remove
slavery
by
moral
and
political
action
as
prescribed
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
they
are
now
living
under
a
pledge
of
their
tremendous
physical
force
to
fasten
the
galling
fetters
of
tyranny
upon
the
limbs
of
millions
in
the
southern
states
they
are
liable
to
be
called
at
any
moment
to
suppress
a
general
insurrection
of
the
slaves
they
authorize
the
to
vote
on
three
fifths
of
his
slaves
as
property
and
thus
enable
him
to
perpetuate
his
oppression
they
support
a
standing
army
at
the
south
for
its
protection
and
they
seize
the
slave
who
has
escaped
into
their
territories
and
send
him
back
to
be
tortured
by
an
enraged
master
or
a
brutal
driver
this
relation
to
slavery
is
criminal
and
full
of
danger
it
must
be
broken
up
these
are
our
views
and
principles
these
our
designs
and
measures
with
entire
confidence
in
the
overruling
justice
of
god
we
plant
ourselves
upon
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
truths
of
divine
revelation
as
upon
the
everlasting
rock
we
shall
organize
societies
if
possible
in
every
city
town
and
village
in
our
land
we
shall
send
forth
agents
to
lift
up
the
voice
of
remonstrance
of
warning
of
entreaty
and
rebuke
we
shall
circulate
unsparingly
and
extensively
tracts
and
periodicals
we
shall
enlist
the
pulpit
and
the
press
in
the
cause
of
the
suffering
and
the
dumb
we
shall
aim
at
a
purification
of
the
churches
from
all
participation
in
the
guilt
of
slavery
we
shall
encourage
the
labor
of
freemen
over
that
of
the
slaves
by
giving
a
preference
to
their
productions
and
we
shall
spare
no
exertions
nor
means
to
bring
the
whole
nation
to
speedy
repentance
our
trust
for
victory
is
solely
in
god
we
may
be
personally
defeated
but
our
principles
never
truth
justice
reason
humanity
must
and
will
gloriously
triumph
already
a
host
is
coming
up
to
the
help
of
the
lord
against
the
mighty
and
the
prospect
before
us
is
full
of
encouragement
submitting
this
declaration
to
the
candid
examination
of
the
people
of
this
country
and
of
the
friends
of
liberty
all
over
the
world
we
hereby
affix
our
signatures
to
it
pledging
ourselves
that
under
the
guidance
and
by
the
help
of
almighty
god
we
will
do
all
that
in
us
lies
consistently
with
this
declaration
of
our
principles
to
overthrow
the
most
execrable
system
of
slavery
that
has
ever
been
witnessed
upon
earth
to
deliver
our
land
from
its
deadliest
curse
to
wipe
out
the
foulest
stain
which
rests
upon
our
national
escutcheon
and
to
secure
to
the
colored
population
of
the
united
states
all
the
rights
and
privileges
which
belong
to
them
as
men
and
as
americans
come
what
may
to
our
persons
our
interests
or
our
reputations
whether
we
live
to
witness
the
triumph
of
justice
liberty
and
humanity
or
perish
untimely
as
martyrs
in
this
great
benevolent
and
holy
cause
the
reading
of
the
paper
was
followed
by
a
discussion
which
lasted
several
hours
a
member
of
the
society
of
friends
moved
its
immediate
adoption
we
have
he
said
all
given
it
our
assent
every
heart
here
responds
to
it
it
is
a
doctrine
of
friends
that
these
strong
and
deep
impressions
should
be
heeded
the
convention
nevertheless
deemed
it
important
to
go
over
the
declaration
carefully
paragraph
by
paragraph
during
the
discussion
one
of
the
spectators
asked
leave
to
say
a
few
words
a
beautiful
and
graceful
woman
in
the
prime
of
life
with
a
face
beneath
her
plain
cap
as
finely
intellectual
as
that
of
madame
roland
offered
some
wise
and
valuable
suggestions
in
a
clear
sweet
voice
the
charm
of
which
i
have
never
forgotten
it
was
lucretia
mott
of
philadelphia
the
president
courteously
thanked
her
and
encouraged
her
to
take
a
part
in
the
discussion
on
the
morning
of
the
last
day
of
our
session
the
declaration
with
its
few
verbal
amendments
carefully
engrossed
on
parchment
was
brought
before
the
convention
samuel
j
may
rose
to
read
it
for
the
last
time
his
sweet
persuasive
voice
faltered
with
the
intensity
of
his
emotions
as
he
repeated
the
solemn
pledges
of
the
concluding
paragraphs
after
a
season
of
silence
david
thurston
of
maine
rose
as
his
name
was
called
by
one
of
the
secretaries
and
affixed
his
name
to
the
document
one
after
another
passed
up
to
the
platform
signed
and
retired
in
silence
all
felt
the
deep
responsibility
of
the
occasion
the
shadow
and
forecast
of
a
struggle
rested
upon
every
countenance
our
work
as
a
convention
was
now
done
president
green
arose
to
make
the
concluding
address
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
uttered
may
have
lent
it
an
impressiveness
not
its
own
but
as
i
now
recall
it
it
seems
to
me
the
most
powerful
and
eloquent
speech
to
which
i
have
ever
listened
he
passed
in
review
the
work
that
had
been
done
the
constitution
of
the
new
society
the
declaration
of
sentiments
and
the
union
and
earnestness
which
had
marked
the
proceedings
his
closing
words
will
never
be
forgotten
by
those
who
heard
them
brethren
it
has
been
good
to
be
here
in
this
hallowed
atmosphere
i
have
been
revived
and
refreshed
this
brief
interview
has
more
than
repaid
me
for
all
that
i
have
ever
suffered
i
have
here
met
congenial
minds
i
have
rejoiced
in
sympathies
delightful
to
the
soul
heart
has
beat
responsive
to
heart
and
the
holy
work
of
seeking
to
benefit
the
outraged
and
despised
has
proved
the
most
blessed
employment
but
now
we
must
retire
from
these
balmy
influences
and
breathe
another
atmosphere
the
chill
will
be
upon
us
the
storm
and
tempest
will
rise
and
the
waves
of
persecution
will
dash
against
our
souls
let
us
be
prepared
for
the
worst
let
us
fasten
ourselves
to
the
throne
of
god
as
with
hooks
of
steel
if
we
cling
not
to
him
our
names
to
that
document
will
be
but
as
dust
let
us
court
no
applause
indulge
in
no
spirit
of
vain
boasting
let
us
be
assured
that
our
only
hope
in
grappling
with
the
bony
monster
is
in
an
arm
that
is
stronger
than
ours
let
us
fix
our
gaze
on
god
and
walk
in
the
light
of
his
countenance
if
our
cause
be
just
and
we
know
it
is
his
omnipotence
is
pledged
to
its
triumph
let
this
cause
be
entwined
around
the
very
fibres
of
our
hearts
let
our
hearts
grow
to
it
so
that
nothing
but
death
can
sunder
the
bond
he
ceased
and
then
amidst
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
breath
of
emotion
in
the
assembly
lifted
up
his
voice
in
a
prayer
to
almighty
god
full
of
fervor
and
feeling
imploring
his
blessing
and
sanctification
upon
the
convention
and
its
labors
and
with
the
solemnity
of
this
supplication
in
our
hearts
we
clasped
hands
in
farewell
and
went
forth
each
man
to
his
place
of
duty
not
knowing
the
things
that
should
befall
us
as
individuals
but
with
a
confidence
never
shaken
by
abuse
and
persecution
in
the
certain
triumph
of
our
cause

and
smith
committee
i
have
received
your
invitation
to
the
anniversary
celebration
of
the
first
settlement
of
kansas
it
would
give
me
great
pleasure
to
visit
your
state
on
an
occasion
of
such
peculiar
interest
and
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
its
brave
and
pioneers
but
i
have
not
health
and
strength
for
the
journey
it
is
very
fitting
that
this
anniversary
should
be
duly
recognized
no
one
of
your
sister
states
has
such
a
record
as
yours
so
full
of
peril
and
adventure
fortitude
and
heroic
devotion
to
freedom
its
baptism
of
martyr
blood
not
only
saved
the
state
to
liberty
but
made
the
abolition
of

everywhere
possible
barber
and
stillwell
and
colpetzer
and
their
associates
did
not
die
in
vain
all
through
your
long
hard
struggle
i
watched
the
course
of
events
in
kansas
with
absorbing
interest
i
rejoiced
while
i
marvelled
at
the
steady
courage
which
no
danger
could
shake
at
the
firm
endurance
which
outwearied
the
brutalities
of
your
slaveholding
invaders
and
at
that
fidelity
to
right
and
duty
which
the
seduction
of
immediate
could
not
swerve
nor
the
military
force
of
a
proslavery
government
overawe
all
my
sympathies
were
with
you
in
that
stern
trial
of
your
loyalty
to
god
and
humanity
and
when
in
the
end
you
had
conquered
peace
and
the
last
of
the
baffled
border
ruffians
had
left
your
territory
i
felt
that
the
doom
of
the
accursed
institution
was
sealed
and
that
its
abolition
was
but
a
question
of
time
a
state
with
such
a
record
will
i
am
sure
be
true
to
its
noble
traditions
and
will
do
all
in
its
power
to
aid
the
victims
of
prejudice
and
oppression
who
may
be
compelled
to
seek
shelter
within
its
borders
i
will
not
for
a
moment
distrust
the
fidelity
of
kansas
to
her
foundation

bless
and
prosper

you

your

william
lloyd
garrison
an
introduction
to
oliver
johnson
william
lloyd
garrison
and
his
times
i
no
not
know
that
any
word
of
mine
can
give
additional
interest
to
this
memorial
of
william
lloyd
garrison
from
the
pen
of
one
of
his
earliest
and
most
devoted
friends
whose
privilege
it
has
been
to
share
his
confidence
and
his
labors
for
nearly
half
a
century
but
i
can
not
well
forego
the
opportunity
afforded
me
to
add
briefly
my
testimony
to
the
tribute
to
the
memory
of
the
great
reformer
whose
friendship
i
have
shared
and
with
whom
i
have
been
associated
in
a
common
cause
from
youth
to
age
my
acquaintance
with
him
commenced
in
boyhood
my
father
was
a
subscriber
to
his
first
paper
the
free
press
and
the
humanitarian
tone
of
his
editorials
awakened
a
deep
interest
in
our
little
household
which
was
increased
by
a
visit
which
he
made
us
when
he
afterwards
edited
the
journal
of
the
times
at
bennington
i
ventured
to
write
him
a
letter
of
encouragement
and
sympathy
urging
him
to
continue
his
labors
against
slavery
and
assuring
him
that
he
could
do
great
things
an
unconscious
prophecy
which
has
been
fulfilled
beyond
the
dream
of
my
boyish
enthusiasm
the
friendship
thus
commenced
has
remained
unbroken
through
half
a
century
confirming
my
early
confidence
in
his
zeal
and
devotion
and
in
the
great
intellectual
and
moral
strength
which
he
brought
to
the
cause
with
which
his
name
is
identified
during
the
long
and
hard
struggle
in
which
the
abolitionists
were
engaged
and
amidst
the
new
and
difficult
questions
and
which
presented
themselves
it
could
scarcely
be
otherwise
than
that
differences
of
opinion
and
action
should
arise
among
them
the
leader
and
his
disciples
could
not
always
see
alike
my
friend
the
author
of
this
book
i
think
generally
found
himself
in
full
accord
with
him
while
i
often
decidedly
dissented
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
use
my
right
of
citizenship
at
the
in
the
cause
of
liberty
while
garrison
with
equal
sincerity
judged
and
counselled
otherwise
each
acted
under
a
sense
of
individual
duty
and
responsibility
and
our
personal
relations
were
undisturbed
if
at
times
the
great
leader
failed
to
do
justice
to
the
motives
of
those
who
while
in
hearty
sympathy
with
his
hatred
of
slavery
did
not
agree
with
some
of
his
opinions
and
methods
it
was
but
the
pardonable
and
not
unnatural
result
of
his
intensity
of
purpose
and
his
with
the
cause
he
advocated
and
while
compelled
to
dissent
in
some
particulars
from
his
judgment
of
men
and
measures
the
great
mass
of
the
antislavcry
people
recognized
his
moral
leadership
the
controversies
of
old
and
new
organization
nonresistance
and
political
action
may
now
be
looked
upon
by
the
parties
to
them
who
still
survive
with
the
philosophic
calmness
which
follows
the
subsidence
of
prejudice
and
passion
we
were
but
fallible
men
and
doubtless
often
erred
in
feeling
speech
and
action
ours
was
but
the
common
experience
of
reformers
in
all
ages
never
in
custom
oiled
grooves
the
world
to
a
higher
level
moves
but
grates
and
grinds
with
friction
hard
on
granite
bowlder
and
flinty
shard
ever
the
virtues
blush
to
find
the
vices
wearing
their
badge
behind
and
graces
and
charities
feel
the
fire
wherein
the
sins
of
the
age
expire
it
is
too
late
now
to
dwell
on
these
differences
i
choose
rather
with
a
feeling
of
gratitude
to
god
to
recall
the
great
happiness
of
laboring
with
the
noble
company
of
whom
garrison
was
the
central
figure
i
love
to
think
of
him
as
he
seemed
to
me
when
in
the
fresh
dawn
of
manhood
he
sat
with
me
in
the
old
haverhill
farmhouse
revolving
even
then
schemes
of
benevolence
or
with
cheery
smile
welcoming
me
to
his
frugal
meal
of
bread
and
milk
in
the
dingy
boston
or
as
i
found
him
in
the
gray
december
morning
in
the
small
attic
of
a
colored
man
in
philadelphia
finishing
his
task
of
drafting
his
immortal
declaration
of
sentiments
of
the
american
society
or
as
i
saw
him
in
the
jail
of
leverett
street
after
his
almost
miraculous
escape
from
the
mob
playfully
inviting
me
to
share
the
safe
lodgings
which
the
state
had
provided
for
him
and
in
all
the
varied
scenes
and
situations
where
we
acted
together
our
parts
in
the
great
endeavor
and
success
of
freedom
the
verdict
of
posterity
in
his
case
may
be
safely
anticipated
with
the
true
reformers
and
benefactors
of
his
race
he
occupies
a
place
inferior
to
none
other
the
private
lives
of
many
who
fought
well
the
battles
of
humanity
have
not
been
without
spot
or
blemish
but
his
private
character
like
his
public
knew
no
dishonor
no
shadow
of
suspicion
rests
upon
the
white
statue
of
a
life
the
fitting
garland
of
which
should
be
the
alpine
flower
that
symbolizes
noble
purity

oak
knoll
danvers
i
need
not
say
how
gladly
i
would
be
with
you
at
the
of
the
american
society
i
am
i
regret
to
say
quite
unable
to
gratify
this
wish
and
can
only
represent
myself
by
a
letter
looking
back
over
the
long
years
of
half
a
century
i
can
scarcely
realize
the
conditions
under
which
the
convention
of
assembled
slavery
was
predominant
like
apollyon
in
pilgrim
progress
it
straddled
over
the
whole
breadth
of
the
way
church
and
state
press
and
pulpit
business
interests
literature
and
fashion
were
prostrate
at
its
feet
our
convention
with
few
exceptions
was
composed
of
men
without
influence
or
position
poor
and
little
known
strong
only
in
their
convictions
and
faith
in
the
justice
of
their
cause
to
onlookers
our
endeavor
to
undo
the
evil
work
of
two
centuries
and
convert
a
nation
to
the
great
renunciation
involved
in
emancipation
must
have
seemed
absurd
in
the
last
degree
our
voices
in
such
an
atmosphere
found
no
echo
we
could
look
for
no
response
but
laughs
of
derision
or
the
missiles
of
a
mob
but
we
felt
that
we
had
the
strength
of
truth
on
our
side
we
were
right
and
all
the
world
about
us
was
wrong
we
had
faith
hope
and
enthusiasm
and
did
our
work
nothing
doubting
amidst
a
generation
who
first
despised
and
then
feared
and
hated
us
for
myself
i
have
never
ceased
to
be
grateful
to
the
divine
providence
for
the
privilege
of
taking
a
part
in
that
work
and
now
for
more
than
twenty
years
we
have
had
a
free
country
no
slave
treads
its
soil
the
anticipated
dangerous
consequences
of
complete
emancipation
have
not
been
felt
the
emancipated
class
as
a
whole
have
done
wisely
and
well
under
circumstances
of
peculiar
difficulty
the
masters
have
learned
that
cotton
can
be
raised
better
by
free
than
by
slave
labor
and
nobody
now
wishes
a
return
to
sectional
prejudices
are
subsiding
the
bitterness
of
the
civil
war
is
slowly
passing
away
we
are
beginning
to
feel
that
we
are
one
people
with
no
really
clashing
interests
and
none
more
truly
rejoice
in
the
growing
prosperity
of
the
south
than
the
old
abolitionists
who
hated
slavery
as
a
curse
to
the
master
as
well
as
to
the
slave
in
view
of
this
commemorative
occasion
many
thoughts
crowd
upon
me
memory
recalls
vanished
faces
and
voices
long
hushed
of
those
who
acted
with
me
in
the
convention
fifty
years
ago
nearly
all
have
passed
into
another
state
of
being
we
who
remain
must
soon
follow
we
have
seen
the
fulfilment
of
our
desire
we
have
outlived
scorn
and
persecution
the
lengthening
shadows
invite
us
to
rest
if
in
looking
back
we
feel
that
we
sometimes
erred
through
impatient
zeal
in
our
contest
with
a
great
wrong
we
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
we
were
influenced
by
no
merely
selfish
considerations
the
low
light
of
our
setting
sun
shines
over
a
free
united
people
and
our
last
prayer
shall
be
for
their
peace
prosperity
and
happiness
response
to
the
celebration
of
my
eightieth
birthday
by
the
colored
citizens
of
washington
to
terrell
and
george
williams
esquires
gentlemen
among
the
great
number
of
tokens
of
interest
and
which
reached
me
on
my
birthday
none
have
touched
me
more
deeply
than
the
proceedings
of
the
great
meeting
of
the
colored
citizens
of
the
nation
capital
of
which
you
are
the
representatives
the
resolutions
of
that
meeting
came
to
me
as
the
voice
of
millions
of
my
countrymen
that
voice
was
dumb
in
slavery
when
more
than
half
a
century
ago
i
put
forth
my
plea
for
the
freedom
of
the
slave
it
could
not
answer
me
from
the
rice
swamp
and
cotton
field
but
now
god
be
praised
it
speaks
from
your
great
meeting
in
washington
and
from
all
the
colleges
and
schools
where
the
youth
of
your
race
are
taught
i
scarcely
expected
then
that
the
people
for
whom
i
pleaded
would
ever
know
of
my
efforts
in
their
behalf
i
can
not
be
too
thankful
to
the
divine
providence
that
i
have
lived
to
hear
their
grateful
response
i
stand
amazed
at
the
rapid
strides
which
your
people
have
made
since
emancipation
at
your
industry
your
acquisition
of
property
and
land
your
zeal
for
education
your
but
unresentful
attitude
toward
those
who
formerly
claimed
to
be
your
masters
your
pathetic
but
manly
appeal
for
just
treatment
and
recognition
i
see
in
all
this
the
promise
that
the
time
is
not
far
distant
when
in
common
with
the
white
race
you
will
have
the
free
undisputed
rights
of
american
citizenship
in
all
parts
of
the
union
and
your
rightful
share
in
the
honors
as
well
as
the
protection
of
the
government
your
letter
would
have
been
answered
sooner
if
it
had
been
possible
i
have
been
literally
overwbelmed
with
letters
and
telegrams
which
owing
to
illness
i
have
been
in
a
great
measure
unable
to
answer
or
even
read
i
tender
to
you
gentlemen
and
to
the
people
you
represent
my
heartfelt
thanks
and
the
assurance
that
while

lasts
you
will
find

been
heretofore

difficult
circumstances
