a

preface
the
charm
of
these
letters
it
will
at
once
be
found
depends
upon
their
simplicity
their
artlessness
their
obvious
candour
they
present
a
plain
untinted
account
of
a
nurse
career
of
the
difficulties
she
has
to
face
and
the
problems
she
has
to
solve
those
who
wish
to
know
something
of
a
nurse
life
and
times
will
find
in
this
writing
a
convincing
narrative
unemotional
and
this
is
no
small
merit
since
the
record
of
nursing
experiences
is
apt
to
be
blurred
by
exaggeration
or
made
nauseous
by
sickly
romance
there
is
pathos
enough
in
the
and
in
the
presence
of
death
but
those
who
come
in
touch
with
it
would
do
better
to
hush
the
knowledge
in
their
hearts
rather
than
to
proclaim
it
on
the
apart
from
this
the
world
must
be
a
little
weary
of
the
astute
sick
child
who
lisps
melodrama
into
the
ear
of
the
kind
nurse
as
well
as
of
the
bizarre
aphorisms
of
the
dying
tramp
the
faults
of
management
and
lapses
of
discipline
which
crop
up
incidentally
in
the
story
are
now
matters
of
the
past
and
are
no
longer
to
be
found
in
either
the
children
hospital
or
the
general
the
novice
who
is
entering
the
profession
of
nursing
will
find
in
these
letters
a
sensible
and
exact
view
of
the
prospect
that
lies
before
her
she
may
further
glean
some
insight
as
to
the
qualifications
of
the
good
nurse
these
qualifications
are
to
be
expressed
neither
by
certificates
nor
by
badges
neither
by
starched
uniforms
nor
by
examination
results
they
are
happily
beyond
the
mechanical
gauge
of
any
examiner
and
above
the
platitudes
of
the
official
testimonial
of
the
perfect
nurse
it
may
be
said
that
her
price
is
far
above
rubies
and
that
her
place
is
high
in
the
company
of
admirable
women
she
is
versed
in
the
elaborate
ritual
of
her
art
she
has
tact
and
sound
judgment
she
can
give
strength
to
the
weak
and
confidence
to
the
faint
at
heart
she
has
that
rarest
sight
which
can
see
the
world
through
the
patient
eyes
and
she
is
possessed
of
those
exquisite
intangible
most
human
sympathies
which
in
the
fullest
degree
belong
alone
to
her
sex

a
nurse
life
in

and
peace
i
the
school
lincoln
this
is
my
usual
day
for
writing
letters
and
i
have
nothing
but
the
usual
things
to
write
to
you
about
each
day
we
get
up
at
the
same
time
do
the
same
sort
of
lessons
not
very
difficult
eat
the
same
sort
of
food
not
very
interesting
and
go
for
the
same
dull
walks
with
an
occasional
game
of
tennis
on
a
lawn
but
i
have
been
thinking
and
the
long
and
short
of
it
is
that
i
am
going
to
persuade
my
people
to
let
me
leave
school
i
think
you
know
that
some
years
ago
i
determined
that
i
would
be
a
nurse
to
be
exact
it
was
in
that
queen
victoria
instituted
the
royal
red
cross
and
in
the
same
year
i
was
grieving
over
the
fact
that
none
of
the
professions
in
which
my
brothers
were
distinguishing
themselves
would
be
open
to
me
as
i
was
only
a
girl
so
i
at
once
decided
that
i
would
try
to
win
the
royal
red
cross
well
i
am
not
thinking
so
much
about
the
decoration
now
as
wars
seem
to
be
few
and
far
between
but
still
i
think
the
nursing
profession
is
the
only
one
i
am
a
bit
fitted
for
and
lately
i
have
been
reading
everything
i
can
get
hold
of
on
the
subject
you
see
i
am
not
a
bit
clever
and
i
am
no
good
at
music
or
languages
so
i
could
never
teach
and
on
account
of
having
been
so
delicate
when
i
was
small
i
am
behind
most
girls
of
my
age
in
many
subjects
but
in
the
two
terms
that
i
have
been
here
i
have
won
two
prizes
and
i
think
i
can
work
up
any
subject
that
i
want
to
as
well
as
most
people
can
i
know
i
am
not
old
enough
to
begin
nursing
yet
but
when
i
am
it
may
be
necessary
to
pay
for
my
first
year
training
so
i
very
much
want
them
to
save
the
money
they
are
now
paying
for
my
education
to
pay
for
that
as
it
seems
to
me
that
i
am
being
stuffed
with
many
subjects
that
after
i
leave
school
i
shall
have
no
further
use
for
i
have
not
yet
quite
decided
which
hospital
i
shall
go
to
it
is
clear
that
if
i
want
to
join
the
army
nursing
service
i
must
go
in
for
three
years
training
in
a
general
hospital
first
but
the
best
of
these
hospitals
wo
accept
candidates
till
they
are
and
that
seems
such
a
very
long
way
off
so
perhaps
i
may
take
a
preliminary
year
in
a
children
hospital
or
some
other
special
hospital
first
but
i
am
not
old
enough
even
for
that
yet
and
as
i
think
is
going
out
to
the
canary
islands
for
the
spring
i
think
it
is
very
likely
i
may
go
with
him
as
you
know
i
love
travelling
i
like
this
place
very
well
and
i
have
many
friends
here
but
one
thing
is
quite
definite
and
that
is
that
i
mean
to
be
a
nurse
and
with
that
in
view
i
think
i
might
be
employing
my
time
more
profitably
than
i
am
doing
here
ii
port
orotava
tenerife
here
we
are
in
comfortable
quarters
and
in
glorious
sunshine
the
grand
old
peak
of
tenerife
with
its
cap
of
snow
looking
down
upon
us
i
wish
you
could
be
transplanted
to
this
warmth
and
brightness
but
you
would
not
have
enjoyed
our
experiences
on
the
way
here
you
know
how
cold
it
was
when
we
left
london
on
the
and
all
down
the
channel
it
was
very
cold
but
fine
and
calm
we
called
at
plymouth
such
a
pretty
harbour
then
after
we
left
there
our
troubles
began
the
next
day
there
was
a
heavy
swell
and
very
few
people
appeared
on
deck
our
stewardess
they
said
had
happened
of
an
accident
but
we
were
well
waited
upon
by
a
nice
little
steward
was
bad
and
stayed
in
her
berth
but
with
the
steward
assistance
i
struggled
up
on
the
upper
deck
and
i
would
not
have
missed
it
for
anything
towards
evening
it
was
really
blowing
hard
and
the
waves
were
grand
we
took
such
plunges
down
into
the
trough
and
then
the
great
ship
trembled
and
seemed
to
pull
herself
together
to
rise
on
the
crest
of
the
next
wave
and
then
take
another
plunge
the
men
were
on
the
trot
all
day
making
everything
fast
it
was
sunday
but
there
was
no
service
the
crew
all
too
hard
at
work
and
the
passengers
chiefly
in
their
berths
towards
evening
i
was
wondering
how
i
should
make
my
cabin
when
the
purser
came
along
and
asked
if
he
might
help
me
down
below
as
the
wind
was
still
rising
and
he
had
been
appointed
by
the
captain
who
said
we
had
all
better
be
down
below
that
night
and
the
next
day
were
really
very
bad
indeed
we
were
battened
down
and
the
were
screwed
on
about
and
the
electric
light
supply
did
not
come
on
till
after
six
so
for
that
time
we
were
in
darkness
and
some
of
the
passengers
were
really
very
much
frightened
tons
of
water
poured
on
the
main
deck
and
down
the
and
men
were
bailing
it
out
near
our
cabins
all
night
long
i
kept
feeling
in
the
dark
to
see
if
there
was
water
in
our
cabin
as
it
rushed
past
the
door
with
a
great
swish
but
the
step
was
high
and
it
did
not
come
over
there
was
no
sleep
for
any
one
that
night
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
keep
from
being
pitched
out
of
our
berths
the
men
were
very
funny
as
they
bailed
the
water
out
and
mopped
up
reminds
one
of
in
our
backyard
pity
my
old
woman
here
sometimes
we
see
a
ship
sometimes
we
ship
a
sea
and
heaps
more
to
the
same
effect
our
steward
said
he
had
never
had
to
bail
out
so
much
water
before
and
he
had
been
six
years
on
the
ship
one
of
the
sails
was
carried
away
and
when
we
got
to
santa
cruz
the
engineers
discovered
that
part
of
the
rudder
had
gone
two
cooks
and
one
of
the
sailors
were
knocked
down
and
injured
but
i
think
not
very
badly
two
of
the
boats
were
washed
out
of
the
davits
and
one
of
the
heavy
next
to
the
one
on
which
i
had
spent
the
afternoon
was
smashed
to
bits
sleep
was
quite
impossible
as
it
was
most
difficult
to
keep
in
berth
and
every
now
and
then
there
was
a
great
crash
as
things
were
broken
in
the
saloons
and
galleys
we
are
still
bruised
and
stiff
from
the
knocking
about
i
have
always
wanted
to
see
a
storm
at
sea
but
i
am
now
quite
satisfied
and
i
shall
never
want
to
see
another
it
is
most
unpleasant
to
be
battened
down
and
the
engines
sound
to
be
so
fearfully
on
the
strain
and
tremble
that
you
feel
you
must
listen
for
the
next
beat
of
the
screw
knowing
that
if
the
engines
should
fail
your
chance
of
weathering
the
storm
would
be
a
very
small
one
indeed
after
that
the
weather
improved
and
also
became
warmer
and
the
passengers
one
by
one
came
crawling
up
on
deck
but
most
of
them
looked
as
though
they
had
been
through
a
long
illness
and
could
talk
about
nothing
but
their
alarm
in
the
storm
and
the
captain
owned
he
had
had
a
very
anxious
time
we
landed
at
santa
cruz
early
one
afternoon
a
very
unsavoury
town
with
dirty
beggars
exhibiting
various
loathsome
diseases
and
following
you
about
after
a
little
delay
we
secured
a
carriage
and
three
horses
to
drive
across
the
island
to
orotava
miles
distant
a
pretty
winding
road
cool
up
in
the
hills
but
becoming
hot
as
we
descended
to
puerto
orotava
the
hotel
was
full
but
we
secured
rooms
in
a
dependence
and
when
we
had
rested
and
changed
we
found
a
ready
to
take
us
across
to
dinner
a
carros
is
a
kind
of
sledge
on
broad
runners
drawn
by
two
oxen
they
are
much
used
in
the
town
as
the
roads
are
paved
with
little
cobbles
which
would
pull
the
wheels
about
a
great
deal
this
is
a
nice
hotel
cool
and
airy
and
the
garden
is
lovely
such
quantities
of
roses
bougainvillias
and
bright
trees
of
hibiscus
there
is
a
good
we
can
use
and
it
is
open
all
down
one
side
only
matting
blinds
that
shows
how
dry
the
climate
is
as
the
table
is
perfectly
true
the
waiters
are
spaniards
who
know
a
little
english
and
like
to
use
it
this
is
jarm
very
goot
we
go
about
with
our
little
red
book
of
phrases
and
sometimes
get
what
we
want
but
more
often
fail
to
make
ourselves
understood
the
natives
are
most
interesting
the
children
such
pretty
little
things
with
very
bright
eyes
up
in
the
hills
they
still
consider
it
is
winter
and
the
men
go
about
with
blankets
tied
round
their
necks
and
when
they
squat
down
on
the
ground
the
blanket
flows
out
and
makes
a
little
tent
round
them
down
here
it
is
really
hot
and
the
small
children
wear
nothing
but
a
little
chemise
the
women
are
pretty
and
they
wear
handkerchiefs
tied
over
their
heads
we
are
close
to
the
sea
and
it
is
such
a
gorgeous
blue
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
i
suppose
it
is
very
deep
round
here
and
the
peak
rises
feet
straight
from
the
sea
there
is
no
english
church
yet
but
the
chaplain
holds
services
in
a
large
room
fitted
up
as
a
church
every
one
rides
when
he
goes
anywhere
here
even
when
going
to
church
so
during
service
there
is
a
large
company
of
ponies
and
donkeys
outside
with
the
attendant
men
and
boys
all
in
white
suits
with
sashes
and
now
and
again
the
donkeys
lift
up
their
voices
i
have
found
a
good
chestnut
pony
lea√±a
that
goes
well
they
are
little
beasts
here
and
it
is
necessary
for
them
to
be
so
as
there
is
only
one
made
road
and
for
the
rest
we
scramble
up
mountain
paths
but
when
we
get
on
the
road
they
simply
scamper
along
has
not
done
much
riding
and
sometimes
when
we
are
scrambling
up
a
steep
place
i
look
back
and
find
her
holding
on
for
dear
life
with
a
most
resigned
expression
on
her
face
but
i
think
she
is
enjoying
it
all
immensely
we
walked
up
to
the
botanical
gardens
the
other
day
and
they
are
perfectly
beautiful
arum
lilies
and
many
of
our
choicest
greenhouse
flowers
growing
like
weeds
and
the
ferns
here
are
so
beautiful
too
up
in
the
kloofs
here
called
we
find
maidenhair
growing
wild
and
in
such
enormous
fronds
i
measured
one
and
it
was
two
feet
high
at
the
gardens
a
very
handsome
young
gardener
a
spaniard
gave
us
huge
bunches
of
roses
to
bring
away
all
the
natives
we
come
across
are
so
polite
and
friendly
every
man
you
pass
raises
his
hat
we
wish
we
could
talk
spanish
to
them
but
so
far
if
we
can
ask
for
what
we
want
it
is
quite
as
much
as
we
can
manage
the
people
often
speak
french
and
i
get
horribly
mixed
the
other
night
a
solemn
se√±or
asked
me
if
i
spoke
french
and
i
said
tr√®s
mui
the
word
they
seem
to
use
the
most
is
as
our
nice
waiter
explained
when
a
gentleman
said
antonio
the
coffee
is
cold
ah
it
shall
be
hot
with
the
english
it
is
always
now
with
us
it
is
we
hear
that
laguna
is
the
fashionable
resort
as
soon
as
it
becomes
too
hot
down
here
but
that
icod
is
the
village
of
the
island
so
we
think
of
driving
over
and
spending
a
night
there
iii
ss
fez
english
channel
since
my
last
letter
we
seem
to
have
been
chiefly
engaged
in
wrestling
with
steamship
companies
in
the
vain
endeavour
to
persuade
them
to
remove
us
from
the
island
leave
was
up
early
in
june
and
as
we
had
return
tickets
by
one
line
we
wrote
to
them
in
good
time
to
secure
berths
at
first
they
made
us
various
promises
but
soon
we
learnt
the
truth
namely
that
all
their
boats
were
full
in
every
berth
long
before
they
came
near
the
island
then
we
began
to
tackle
other
lines
but
you
see
nearly
all
the
boats
come
from
new
zealand
or
the
cape
and
this
is
the
favourite
time
for
going
home
also
there
is
the
attraction
of
the
paris
exhibition
so
i
can
not
tell
you
on
how
many
ships
we
have
applied
for
berths
and
always
in
the
end
received
the
news
every
berth
full
personally
i
did
not
mind
as
i
enjoyed
every
day
on
the
island
but
it
was
awkward
for
some
things
and
eventually
we
had
to
decide
to
sail
on
board
a
small
cargo
steamer
that
calls
at
orotava
instead
of
at
santa
cruz
and
carries
a
few
passengers
home
at
a
leisurely
speed
but
before
i
tell
you
of
the
voyage
i
must
tell
you
a
little
about
our
last
few
days
on
the
island
one
day
we
drove
over
to
icod
a
pretty
little
village
about
two
drive
from
orotava
much
coffee
is
grown
at
icod
and
also
plenty
of
fruit
oranges
lemons
figs
we
rode
from
there
to
gerachico
a
pretty
ride
along
the
shore
where
a
whole
village
was
engulfed
when
the
peak
last
erupted
but
it
is
now
again
built
over
and
we
could
not
see
much
of
interest
remaining
se√±ora
carolina
reigns
at
the
small
icod
hotel
and
made
us
very
comfortable
but
neither
she
nor
any
one
we
met
in
the
place
spoke
any
english
so
it
was
good
practice
for
us
and
our
spanish
came
off
better
than
i
thought
it
would
we
decided
not
to
climb
the
peak
as
you
can
not
do
it
from
orotava
without
spending
a
night
somewhere
up
the
mountain
but
one
day
and
i
joined
a
party
for
a
day
on
the
ca√±adas
the
range
from
which
the
peak
rises
we
mounted
our
ponies
at
in
brilliant
sunshine
and
at
different
points
picked
up
our
friends
till
we
were
a
party
of
ten
with
a
crowd
of
attendant
boys
to
carry
our
lunch
the
first
part
of
the
ride
was
easy
and
pleasant
then
as
we
got
higher
it
became
more
of
a
scramble
over
loose
stones
that
any
english
pony
would
have
said
were
only
fit
for
a
goat
to
be
asked
to
walk
over
just
as
the
path
was
becoming
really
steep
we
left
the
sunshine
and
found
ourselves
in
a
thick
bank
of
clouds
cold
and
damp
and
had
to
go
very
cautiously
in
single
file
the
chattering
were
very
silent
their
spirits
are
easily
damped
and
said
it
was
soon
we
emerged
above
the
clouds
into
a
scorching
sun
and
finding
a
piece
of
fairly
level
ground
some
of
us
took
a
little
canter
to
try
to
get
warm
but
we
came
to
a
sandy
place
and
there
lea√±a
took
it
into
her
head
to
lie
down
and
roll
i
saw
what
she
was
up
to
and
managed
to
roll
out
of
her
way
so
my
saddle
was
more
damaged
than
i
was
but
as
my
clothes
were
very
wet
with
the
mist
the
sand
adhered
we
had
a
pleasant
lunch
at
a
height
of
feet
while
the
ponies
were
and
fed
and
some
of
us
thought
we
should
like
to
camp
for
the
night
and
climb
the
peak
in
the
morning
but
when
we
had
finished
lunch
we
had
only
two
left
between
us
so
concluded
we
had
better
return
before
night
the
view
was
lovely
looking
the
banks
of
clouds
to
the
very
blue
sea
with
the
other
islands
in
the
distance
and
behind
us
the
grand
old
peak
the
ride
down
a
different
way
was
rather
perilous
the
ponies
jumping
from
rock
to
rock
in
a
perfectly
marvellous
way
often
just
on
the
side
of
a
precipice
but
it
was
too
much
for
some
of
our
party
and
they
insisted
upon
walking
down
and
this
rather
delayed
us
as
they
could
not
go
nearly
so
fast
nor
were
they
so
as
the
ponies
we
got
in
at
very
tired
and
very
sunburnt
but
having
enjoyed
the
day
immensely
and
our
ponies
were
quite
fresh
and
wanted
to
gallop
all
the
way
directly
they
got
on
the
road
i
do
think
i
have
told
you
about
the
they
make
such
a
noise
after
sundown
you
might
think
there
were
thousands
of
ducks
quacking
a
gentleman
wanted
to
take
some
back
to
england
with
him
so
one
day
we
caught
for
him
and
they
all
escaped
in
our
rooms
such
a
hunt
for
them
and
i
could
not
finish
telling
you
about
orotava
without
one
word
about
the
they
are
really
a
great
trial
and
seem
to
abound
everywhere
especially
in
the
carriages
after
various
false
alarms
our
little
steamer
the
tons
arrived
and
began
to
take
in
a
cargo
of
the
solemn
old
oxen
brought
the
carros
for
our
baggage
and
our
many
friends
escorted
us
down
to
the
jetty
where
most
of
the
spanish
population
seemed
to
be
collected
to
see
us
off
it
is
always
a
difficult
landing
at
orotava
and
the
small
gave
us
a
good
tossing
before
we
were
hauled
up
the
gangway
it
was
rather
horrid
before
we
got
away
and
i
was
the
only
lady
who
was
not
before
the
anchor
was
up
such
a
change
from
the
just
one
very
small
saloon
and
our
cabins
very
tiny
no
upper
deck
and
very
little
room
on
the
main
deck
of
course
no
doctor
on
board
and
no
stewardess
but
it
was
only
for
a
short
time
we
thought
and
we
were
determined
to
make
the
best
of
things
and
soon
found
there
were
compensations
namely
a
charming
captain
nice
crew
and
most
attentive
stewards
and
very
soon
my
small
was
established
on
the
bridge
and
i
learnt
more
about
navigation
than
i
should
have
learnt
in
years
on
a
liner
there
were
twelve
of
us
passengers
all
people
we
knew
and
officers
and
crew
also
a
big
dog
and
a
sheep
who
occasionally
strolled
into
our
cabins
until
nearly
the
end
of
the
voyage
when
the
meat
hung
up
in
the
stern
there
was
no
refrigerator
on
board
had
run
low
and
then
one
day
i
saw
a
sheep
skin
being
washed
over
the
side
there
were
also
many
noisy
cocks
and
hens
and
a
few
ducks
and
last
but
not
least
swarms
of
rats
i
had
some
in
my
cabin
and
the
rats
rather
fancied
it
and
when
i
threw
things
at
them
to
make
them
go
away
they
would
sit
on
the
cabin
doorstep
to
wash
their
faces
and
lick
their
lips
we
had
lovely
weather
as
far
as
madeira
when
we
got
there
we
found
it
was
a
public
holiday
and
we
should
have
to
stay
three
days
as
there
were
pipes
of
wine
to
be
got
on
board
and
the
natives
would
not
work
on
the
holiday
this
gave
us
a
good
opportunity
to
see
the
island
and
it
was
very
enjoyable
it
is
far
more
green
than
tenerife
but
i
should
say
the
climate
though
very
mild
is
not
nearly
so
dry
the
captain
arranged
a
very
nice
trip
for
us
to
a
part
of
the
island
that
is
not
often
visited
by
people
who
call
only
at
funchal
we
had
to
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
go
on
board
a
small
launch
that
takes
the
mails
round
the
island
at
it
was
beautiful
moonlight
and
funchal
looked
very
pretty
as
we
steamed
away
round
the
great
loo
rock
we
reached
caliette
at
and
had
to
whistle
for
some
time
before
the
people
woke
up
and
brought
a
small
boat
out
for
us
they
made
us
some
coffee
and
we
had
breakfast
and
then
got
into
hammocks
slung
on
long
poles
and
two
men
carried
us
up
and
up
the
hills
till
we
came
to
a
weird
tunnel
which
we
went
through
by
the
light
of
and
emerged
in
the
most
grand
scenery
rugged
hills
and
beautiful
waterfalls
such
very
vivid
greenery
everywhere
and
amongst
all
the
vegetation
we
came
upon
one
bed
of
english
that
was
most
refreshing
we
lunched
and
rested
for
some
time
by
a
beautiful
waterfall
called
i
think
rabacal
and
then
going
down
it
was
very
hot
and
in
spite
of
the
steepness
of
the
paths
some
of
us
slept
in
the
hammocks
as
we
jogged
along
the
men
carried
us
about
miles
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
did
not
seem
at
all
tired
but
there
was
a
little
competition
to
carry
me
as
i
was
the
lightest
of
the
party
we
got
back
to
funchal
about
and
were
quite
ready
for
bed
owing
to
this
delay
at
madeira
on
account
of
the
general
holiday
the
voyage
is
taking
much
longer
than
usual
and
by
the
time
we
get
in
or
hope
to
get
in
we
shall
be
fourteen
days
out
from
orotava
instead
of
the
five
days
we
took
from
london
to
santa
cruz
in
consequence
of
this
the
provisions
are
running
rather
low
and
a
few
things
have
quite
run
out
but
i
have
enjoyed
the
voyage
immensely
before
i
return
home
i
hope
to
visit
two
or
three
children
hospitals
in
london
to
be
interviewed
by
the
matrons
so
as
to
settle
where
i
will
go
to
begin
training
i
am
not
old
enough
for
admission
to
a
general
hospital
yet
iv
children
hospital
london
i
thought
i
would
wait
till
i
had
been
here
three
months
before
writing
to
tell
you
of
my
raw
probationer
days
at
first
it
was
all
so
very
new
to
me
that
it
seemed
very
very
hard
and
i
really
think
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fact
that
one
of
my
brothers
had
bet
me
that
i
should
give
it
up
in
a
fortnight
i
should
have
done
so
in
the
first
week
but
i
rarely
bet
and
when
i
do
i
like
to
win
and
having
had
to
wait
so
many
years
before
i
could
persuade
a
matron
that
i
was
old
enough
and
strong
enough
i
really
could
not
lightly
give
it
up
by
the
end
of
my
month
on
trial
i
began
to
feel
my
way
and
was
quite
certain
that
i
wished
to
stay
on
if
they
would
keep
me
and
though
they
were
not
enthusiastic
in
telling
me
my
services
were
invaluable
their
only
cause
of
complaint
appeared
to
be
that
i
was
slow
so
they
were
graciously
pleased
to
accept
my
guineas
in
instalments
and
for
that
sum
to
allow
me
the
privilege
of
working
hard
and
fast
for
an
average
of
eleven
hours
a
day
paying
for
my
own
laundry
and
buying
my
own
uniform
for
the
period
of
one
year
i
do
think
i
was
slow
in
attending
to
the
children
but
at
first
a
very
large
part
of
one
time
is
taken
up
with
cleaning
and
housemaiding
sweeping
dusting
scrubbing
polishing
the
brass
taps
and
and
washing
the
children
pinafores
and
bibs
when
i
began
i
hardly
knew
the
difference
between
a
broom
and
a
i
knew
nothing
of
the
properties
of
soda
and
hudson
soap
and
i
do
think
i
had
ever
dusted
a
room
so
i
did
not
know
how
fond
the
dust
was
of
collecting
on
the
top
of
screens
and
pictures
and
and
it
took
me
time
to
discover
these
things
at
home
our
had
always
been
and
except
for
a
day
hunting
there
were
very
few
things
that
excited
my
interest
before
that
hour
so
i
expected
to
find
it
difficult
to
have
had
my
breakfast
and
to
be
ready
to
go
on
duty
at
but
in
looking
back
upon
my
first
week
in
hospital
the
thing
that
impressed
itself
upon
me
more
than
the
trouble
of
early
rising
was
the
fact
that
during
that
first
month
i
was
always
hungry
i
have
got
over
the
difficulty
now
as
a
weekly
parcel
of
tuck
arrives
from
home
and
when
this
comes
to
an
end
i
buy
some
or
if
funds
are
low
some
plain
chocolate
to
carry
on
till
the
next
parcel
arrives
nearly
all
the
nurses
either
have
food
sent
or
else
buy
a
good
deal
of
course
i
did
not
know
this
would
be
necessary
and
had
not
got
money
at
first
and
there
are
a
few
nurses
who
can
not
afford
to
buy
but
of
course
we
share
with
them
dinner
is
at
and
that
is
the
best
meal
of
the
day
as
the
matron
sometimes
comes
to
it
so
the
meat
is
generally
well
cooked
it
is
always
a
scramble
to
get
lunch
some
time
between
ten
and
twelve
and
it
is
not
interesting
just
chunks
of
cold
meat
and
every
other
day
our
butter
is
issued
to
us
twice
a
week
lb
in
a
little
tin
mug
and
we
have
to
carry
this
mug
about
for
meals
in
the
and
in
the
ward
kitchen
for
as
long
as
it
lasts
but
if
you
do
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
your
mug
it
often
becomes
empty
in
the
first
day
or
two
and
you
stand
a
good
chance
of
having
to
eat
dry
bread
for
the
days
before
the
new
butter
is
put
out
i
very
much
dislike
coffee
but
there
is
nothing
else
provided
for
breakfast
but
coffee
and
a
loaf
of
stale
bread
and
our
own
butter
if
we
have
any
left
so
we
seem
to
start
the
day
very
well
for
the
rest
we
make
tea
twice
a
day
in
the
ward
kitchens
and
can
use
the
ward
bread
if
funds
are
high
and
the
lunch
bad
we
sometimes
indulge
in
rashers
of
bacon
sometimes
on
sunday
we
have
a
sausage
or
two
but
it
is
more
usual
to
fill
in
the
cracks
with
tea
and
cake
up
to
now
i
have
been
working
in
a
medical
ward
of
cots
the
sister
has
charge
of
a
surgical
ward
as
well
and
i
think
she
prefers
the
surgical
work
so
we
do
see
very
much
of
her
except
when
the
physicians
go
round
or
when
we
have
very
bad
cases
in
i
like
her
very
well
but
she
is
rather
stiff
and
most
of
the
information
i
am
picking
up
is
from
the
staff
nurse
and
from
the
house
physician
who
is
most
kind
in
explaining
the
reasons
for
the
various
symptoms
we
notice
in
the
cases
and
what
results
he
hopes
for
in
the
treatment
he
prescribes
we
had
a
very
sad
case
in
the
other
day
a
working
man
brought
in
a
little
chap
of
two
called
stanley
very
ill
with
pneumonia
and
rickets
he
said
his
wife
was
in
another
hospital
for
an
operation
and
he
had
to
go
to
work
and
leave
all
his
children
in
charge
of
the
eldest
a
boy
of
ten
and
his
wife
had
been
so
very
ill
he
had
had
to
go
to
see
her
in
the
evenings
and
so
had
not
noticed
how
ill
stanley
was
at
first
he
kept
holding
out
his
arms
to
me
and
calling
in
such
a
piteous
little
voice
lady
lady
but
he
soon
got
quite
contented
only
every
day
weaker
and
weaker
his
quiet
patient
father
came
every
evening
and
sat
by
him
and
his
mother
was
to
come
to
see
him
as
soon
as
ever
she
was
well
enough
but
the
poor
woman
was
too
late
and
when
early
one
morning
she
arrived
in
a
cab
with
a
nurse
from
the
hospital
he
had
just
been
carried
down
to
the
mortuary
and
we
could
only
take
her
to
see
him
lying
there
looking
very
sweet
with
some
white
lilies
in
his
hand
then
we
have
dear
philip
in
he
is
tubercular
and
a
pretty
boy
but
i
think
he
is
too
good
to
live
i
am
afraid
his
mother
drinks
and
he
has
a
rough
time
of
it
at
home
but
his
father
is
a
very
nice
man
here
we
all
spoil
him
as
he
is
really
very
ill
but
is
always
so
patient
and
bright
he
has
a
mop
of
brown
curls
and
the
smile
of
an
angel
he
is
one
of
the
few
children
of
the
slums
who
always
insists
upon
kneeling
up
to
say
his
prayers
and
though
sometimes
he
has
so
little
breath
to
spare
that
i
have
to
say
the
words
for
him
he
just
kneels
there
and
smiles
when
i
get
hold
of
the
words
he
wants
to
help
him
out
as
a
contrast
another
of
my
patients
was
samuel
abraham
the
very
ugliest
little
scrap
of
skin
and
bones
you
ever
saw
when
he
came
in
he
was
seven
months
old
and
weighed
only
eight
pounds
he
was
in
for
six
weeks
and
absolutely
refused
to
put
on
a
single
ounce
then
every
one
got
tired
of
samuel
and
as
i
had
not
had
a
turn
at
feeding
him
he
was
handed
over
to
me
and
more
by
good
luck
than
by
good
management
he
began
to
improve
and
at
the
end
of
my
first
week
he
had
put
on
six
ounces
and
since
then
he
has
steadily
gained
in
weight
and
begins
to
look
more
like
a
baby
than
a
monkey
he
went
home
the
other
day
and
i
wonder
much
whether
his
poor
mother
will
be
able
to
rear
him
as
i
am
sure
he
will
miss
the
hourly
attention
he
has
had
here
we
should
have
kept
him
longer
but
we
had
three
cases
of
scarlet
fever
and
they
had
to
be
sent
to
the
fever
hospital
and
all
the
children
who
could
be
moved
had
to
go
home
and
the
ward
will
be
sulphured
but
i
am
writing
this
letter
as
i
sit
in
the
bare
ward
beside
one
poor
little
boy
called
jackie
who
is
so
desperately
ill
with
meningitis
that
they
do
like
to
move
him
it
is
a
curious
case
jackie
belongs
to
people
and
his
illness
was
caused
by
a
fall
out
of
a
his
head
is
so
retracted
that
it
really
nearly
touches
his
buttocks
and
he
lies
in
a
stiff
backward
bow
he
is
quite
unconscious
and
i
have
to
feed
him
with
a
nasal
tube
his
temperature
goes
up
to
and
at
first
i
was
rather
nervous
at
being
special
with
him
as
i
have
been
here
only
three
months
and
i
have
never
seen
a
case
like
this
before
and
the
sister
may
not
come
in
to
see
me
as
she
has
to
go
into
the
surgical
ward
and
we
may
still
be
infectious
but
of
course
i
can
ask
her
advice
about
anything
and
the
house
physician
comes
in
twice
a
day
and
is
most
kind
he
assures
me
no
one
could
possibly
do
more
for
jackie
than
i
am
doing
i
think
he
will
be
moved
to
a
small
ward
if
he
lives
so
long
and
then
i
expect
i
shall
have
to
disinfect
and
very
likely
go
to
a
surgical
ward
v
children
hospital
london
i
know
it
is
a
long
time
since
my
last
letter
to
you
but
really
the
days
are
so
full
of
work
there
seems
to
be
no
peace
for
letters
and
at
night
one
is
so
weary
that
after
a
wrestle
to
obtain
a
bath
one
feels
fit
for
nothing
but
bed
and
when
i
get
to
bed
i
feel
obliged
to
take
my
anatomy
and
physiology
books
and
do
a
little
study
as
the
residents
are
very
good
about
giving
us
lectures
and
i
should
hate
not
to
do
decently
in
the
exams
i
think
when
i
last
wrote
we
had
just
closed
the
medical
ward
whose
sister
had
had
the
honour
of
beginning
my
hospital
education
and
after
a
few
hours
off
duty
i
was
sent
up
to
a
surgical
ward
on
the
top
floor
next
door
to
the
theatre
i
went
up
rather
in
fear
and
trembling
as
it
was
noted
for
being
the
hardest
ward
in
the
hospital
as
the
nurses
were
responsible
for
the
theatre
as
well
and
i
did
see
how
i
could
squeeze
more
work
into
the
days
than
i
had
been
doing
on
the
medical
side
but
i
received
a
nice
welcome
from
the
sister
and
soon
found
that
she
was
one
of
the
best
she
did
wait
for
us
to
do
things
wrong
and
then
scold
us
but
she
took
pains
to
show
us
the
way
to
do
them
and
then
woe
betide
those
who
did
do
their
best
i
shall
always
remember
my
second
morning
up
there
when
she
said
nurse
your
bathroom
looks
very
smart
and
nice
it
was
the
first
time
a
sister
had
given
me
a
word
of
praise
and
from
that
day
i
did
mind
how
hard
i
worked
to
please
her
there
was
a
different
atmosphere
about
that
ward
and
i
soon
felt
better
in
it
the
children
too
were
a
more
cheery
set
some
of
them
were
very
ill
but
we
did
not
get
the
poor
little
wasting
babies
and
it
was
very
seldom
we
had
a
child
who
minded
a
noise
so
that
the
boys
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
could
be
allowed
to
sing
all
the
popular
songs
of
the
day
and
they
were
a
very
merry
crew
many
people
think
it
must
be
very
depressing
to
see
so
many
sick
children
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
children
have
very
little
pain
or
at
any
rate
only
for
a
very
short
time
and
many
of
them
are
enjoying
a
better
time
than
they
have
had
in
their
lives
before
they
are
kept
clean
and
warm
and
have
plenty
of
good
food
and
plenty
of
toys
to
play
with
and
people
who
understand
them
when
they
have
a
pain
even
when
they
ca
explain
where
it
is
there
have
been
many
changes
since
i
came
here
several
nurses
who
came
after
i
did
have
already
left
and
one
has
gone
away
ill
i
had
been
in
the
surgical
ward
only
a
fortnight
when
i
was
unlucky
enough
to
pick
up
influenza
and
was
sent
to
bed
with
another
nurse
in
a
small
up
above
the
measles
ward
they
were
rather
suspicious
as
to
whether
we
had
scarlet
fever
as
there
was
still
some
in
the
hospital
so
no
one
was
supposed
to
visit
us
except
the
home
sister
her
visits
were
few
and
far
between
poor
thing
she
was
stout
and
the
stairs
were
many
we
both
felt
pretty
bad
with
high
temperatures
and
should
have
come
off
badly
for
attention
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
measles
nurse
who
had
only
two
convalescent
children
and
she
used
to
break
the
rules
and
come
up
to
look
after
us
one
day
she
had
run
up
with
an
offering
of
buttered
toast
when
we
heard
a
door
open
downstairs
and
that
the
matron
was
coming
nurse
vanished
into
our
little
but
there
was
no
escape
from
that
without
passing
our
door
and
besides
the
matron
was
sure
to
call
upon
the
measles
ward
on
her
way
downstairs
the
buttered
toast
was
stowed
away
under
the
and
we
were
trying
to
be
calm
and
answer
matron
enquiries
as
to
our
health
when
we
heard
a
rattling
of
the
on
which
our
food
was
sent
up
from
the
kitchen
and
we
realised
that
nurse
had
determined
to
crawl
into
that
and
so
descend
to
her
post
of
duty
with
much
alarm
we
heard
the
lift
go
down
and
trembled
lest
the
unaccustomed
weight
should
cause
it
to
go
down
with
a
run
matron
must
have
thought
us
very
distrait
but
we
pleaded
severe
headaches
a
plea
that
was
true
enough
and
she
soon
went
away
hoping
we
should
shortly
be
fit
for
duty
again
we
were
very
thankful
when
nurse
appeared
to
report
her
safety
with
nothing
worse
than
a
crushed
cap
and
a
crumpled
apron
which
had
been
severely
commented
upon
by
the
matron
they
were
short
of
nurses
so
as
soon
as
i
could
get
about
i
went
on
duty
again
and
had
a
nice
welcome
back
to
my
ward
but
it
happened
to
be
very
heavy
just
then
with
several
small
babies
and
two
of
them
had
that
had
been
operated
upon
and
it
was
most
important
that
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
cry
at
all
so
one
evening
i
was
sitting
in
the
ward
cleaning
some
instruments
that
had
been
used
in
the
theatre
for
a
nasty
case
of
mastoid
abscess
and
one
of
these
babies
began
to
whimper
i
jumped
up
to
subdue
it
and
in
doing
so
i
had
the
bad
luck
to
prick
my
thumb
the
baby
soon
settled
down
again
and
then
sister
came
in
and
cleaned
and
dressed
my
thumb
but
in
a
few
days
i
was
in
for
a
badly
poisoned
hand
and
it
had
to
be
opened
in
several
places
by
the
house
surgeon
he
wanted
me
to
be
off
duty
and
as
much
as
possible
so
sister
arranged
to
give
me
some
extra
time
and
was
awfully
kind
in
doing
part
of
my
work
for
me
but
when
she
told
matron
about
it
matron
said
nurse
has
been
off
duty
over
a
week
with
influenza
if
she
has
to
go
off
again
she
had
better
go
home
and
stop
there
as
she
is
not
strong
enough
for
the
work
but
sister
did
want
me
to
go
and
fortunately
the
ward
was
getting
lighter
and
i
could
keep
the
babies
quiet
even
with
my
arm
in
a
sling
so
i
did
what
i
could
and
was
sent
into
the
kitchen
when
the
visiting
surgeon
went
round
lest
he
should
order
me
away
the
house
surgeon
was
furious
with
the
matron
about
it
but
he
looked
after
me
well
and
though
my
arm
was
very
painful
for
a
fortnight
and
allowed
me
very
little
sleep
it
soon
improved
but
my
thumb
is
still
stiff
and
unbendable
and
the
house
surgeon
is
afraid
it
will
always
be
so
as
he
had
to
cut
into
it
so
deeply
i
must
tell
you
about
a
quaint
child
we
had
in
about
that
time
she
was
a
little
irish
girl
called
kathleen
with
a
mop
of
red
hair
and
a
pretty
little
face
but
with
very
crossed
eyes
kathleen
was
five
years
old
but
had
never
walked
as
her
legs
were
badly
deformed
but
she
got
about
at
a
great
pace
on
the
floor
in
a
style
of
her
own
invention
you
never
quite
knew
where
you
were
with
kathleen
she
had
a
very
sharp
temper
but
she
was
devoted
to
sister
and
was
obedient
to
me
but
any
directions
given
to
her
as
to
her
behaviour
by
other
nurses
were
received
with
scorn
and
entirely
ignored
and
if
sister
and
i
happened
to
be
off
duty
together
on
our
return
we
generally
had
to
remonstrate
with
the
child
for
some
piece
of
naughtiness
and
then
she
would
soon
be
sobbing
and
penitent
one
day
i
was
off
in
the
afternoon
and
when
came
kathleen
was
missing
they
searched
everywhere
for
her
and
matron
who
happened
to
pass
joined
in
the
search
eventually
she
was
found
shut
up
in
the
sisters
dining
hall
very
much
engaged
with
the
the
butter
had
all
gone
so
had
most
of
the
sugar
some
of
the
biscuits
and
when
discovered
she
was
just
drinking
up
the
vinegar
with
relish
matron
remarked
a
good
toffee
mixture
and
then
she
spent
trying
to
make
the
child
say
she
was
sorry
but
without
success
so
she
smacked
her
and
sent
her
to
bed
on
my
return
of
course
i
had
an
account
of
kathleen
misdoings
and
thought
it
better
to
take
no
notice
of
her
all
the
evening
as
i
did
my
work
the
little
thing
sat
up
in
her
cot
watching
me
go
up
and
down
the
ward
with
her
poor
crooked
eyes
quite
dry
but
when
the
children
were
all
settled
for
the
night
and
the
lights
turned
down
i
went
to
her
and
she
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
sobbed
out
i
sorry
and
i
do
it
never
no
more
but
i
was
sorry
to
that
woman
and
i
do
care
if
she
does
smack
me
but
i
shall
tell
my
mother
when
i
go
home
then
i
lifted
her
out
of
her
cot
to
warm
her
toes
by
the
fire
and
after
a
long
talk
i
extracted
a
promise
that
she
would
tell
matron
she
was
sorry
next
day
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
she
was
fast
asleep
i
expect
that
i
shall
be
moved
from
this
ward
very
soon
and
i
shall
be
very
sorry
the
work
is
hard
and
fast
but
sister
works
as
hard
as
we
do
so
we
are
very
happy
together
and
i
feel
i
am
getting
on
i
have
got
used
to
the
theatre
work
too
and
after
much
labour
have
learnt
the
names
of
all
the
instruments
in
common
use
so
that
i
can
hand
them
as
they
are
asked
for
and
sometimes
i
am
trusted
to
put
out
what
i
think
will
be
required
for
an
operation
and
when
sister
looks
them
over
she
does
often
find
anything
missing
vi
children
hospital
london
soon
after
i
last
wrote
i
was
sent
down
to
the
department
quite
a
different
kind
of
work
and
i
should
like
it
for
long
but
it
was
interesting
for
a
time
the
numbers
vary
a
great
deal
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
children
may
be
brought
up
in
one
day
and
many
of
them
require
small
dressings
to
be
attended
to
then
on
two
afternoons
in
the
week
the
surgeons
do
small
operations
and
sometimes
there
are
children
all
recovering
from
an√¶sthetics
at
the
same
time
and
all
requiring
to
be
carefully
watched
there
is
a
dear
old
sister
in
charge
and
one
afternoon
a
week
we
go
out
together
to
visit
any
special
hip
cases
that
are
being
treated
in
their
own
homes
after
having
been
here
slums
we
sometimes
have
to
go
to
and
yet
it
is
wonderful
how
nicely
the
poor
mothers
keep
these
children
when
they
are
just
shown
the
right
way
we
have
one
jolly
little
chap
who
has
been
for
two
months
in
an
extension
apparatus
rigged
up
on
a
big
perambulator
with
the
weight
hanging
over
the
handle
he
has
improved
so
much
that
they
will
soon
wheel
him
up
in
his
and
i
think
the
doctor
will
then
sign
his
release
from
the
extension
some
of
the
nurses
had
rather
a
joke
the
other
day
a
joke
which
had
good
results
for
the
rest
of
us
there
is
a
confectioner
shop
near
here
which
we
largely
patronise
and
these
girls
who
were
on
night
duty
were
hungry
as
usual
and
they
went
into
this
shop
for
tea
and
scones
before
going
to
bed
while
they
were
there
our
secretary
superintendent
came
in
and
afterwards
who
is
quite
a
friend
of
ours
told
the
nurses
that
seeing
them
there
he
asked
her
whether
many
nurses
were
customers
of
hers
and
she
pretending
not
to
know
him
said
oh
yes
sir
but
we
gets
more
nurses
from
the
children
hospital
than
from
any
of
the
other
hospitals
round
here
you
see
they
feeds
them
badly
there
i
believe
he
went
straight
back
to
the
hospital
and
made
inquiries
about
our
food
for
not
many
days
after
we
had
bacon
for
breakfast
and
now
there
is
always
besides
the
bread
put
on
the
table
and
we
find
it
a
vast
improvement
another
thing
has
happened
which
has
helped
us
considerably
a
new
nurse
has
joined
who
is
a
cousin
of
the
senior
surgeon
she
is
an
awfully
nice
girl
but
does
not
look
very
strong
and
after
a
week
or
two
she
retired
to
bed
with
a
strained
back
not
very
bad
then
her
cousin
visited
her
and
then
he
visited
the
committee
and
it
seems
they
had
no
idea
we
had
to
carry
all
the
big
lotion
bottles
up
from
the
dispensary
and
the
heavy
blocks
of
ice
from
the
basement
and
that
we
had
to
drag
down
the
great
bags
of
soiled
linen
to
the
basement
and
then
along
a
lengthy
passage
no
joke
on
the
doctor
day
when
all
the
twenty
cots
have
clean
sheets
and
counterpanes
so
now
the
porters
do
these
things
for
us
and
we
mournfully
regret
that
we
were
not
clever
enough
to
arrange
for
one
of
our
number
to
strain
her
back
at
the
beginning
of
our
training
instead
of
nearly
at
the
end
but
without
a
senior
surgeon
for
a
cousin
it
might
not
have
paid
nurse
is
nearly
well
again
now
and
she
has
asked
me
to
spend
part
of
my
next
free
sunday
with
her
at
the
house
of
this
same
senior
surgeon
i
shall
be
horribly
shy
but
i
well
refuse
my
brother
has
come
to
live
in
town
now
and
it
is
very
nice
for
me
he
is
reading
for
an
and
has
rooms
in
barnard
inn
such
a
funny
old
rookery
near
holborn
and
not
far
from
here
he
stands
me
a
good
dinner
about
once
a
week
when
i
am
off
in
the
evening
and
in
return
i
darn
his
socks
for
him
try
to
take
him
to
church
on
sundays
and
report
his
doings
in
my
letters
home
so
that
he
need
only
send
them
occasional
while
i
was
in
the
department
i
was
supposed
to
have
my
sundays
free
unless
an
extra
was
especially
wanted
anywhere
and
one
saturday
evening
i
was
preparing
to
go
away
for
the
night
when
a
message
came
that
the
night
sister
was
not
well
and
matron
who
was
going
away
till
monday
wished
me
to
go
on
duty
for
her
for
the
two
nights
that
was
about
so
i
went
to
lie
down
for
a
bit
and
at
the
home
sister
gave
me
the
report
and
the
hospital
keys
and
i
took
charge
feeling
rather
important
but
also
rather
a
fraud
as
several
of
the
charge
nurses
then
on
night
duty
had
been
here
for
many
years
and
knew
far
more
than
i
did
however
we
got
on
very
well
together
and
i
rather
enjoyed
running
round
to
the
different
wards
and
helping
with
the
bad
cases
there
was
one
especially
sad
case
a
girl
of
ten
who
had
been
frightened
by
rats
when
left
locked
up
in
a
house
she
had
chorea
so
badly
that
we
had
to
let
her
sleep
on
a
mattress
on
the
floor
and
it
was
most
difficult
to
keep
any
clothes
on
her
or
to
feed
her
poor
child
her
temperature
gradually
rose
till
it
reached
before
she
died
a
few
days
later
the
doctors
said
it
was
the
worst
case
they
had
ever
seen
and
i
hope
i
may
never
see
another
case
die
of
chorea
on
the
monday
morning
i
went
to
bed
at
and
had
to
be
on
duty
in
the
department
at
we
had
a
heavy
day
and
when
we
finished
at
you
can
imagine
my
disgust
at
receiving
a
message
from
matron
that
i
was
to
relieve
the
nurse
who
was
in
quarantine
with
a
case
from
to
i
was
very
glad
the
child
whooped
fairly
often
as
otherwise
i
should
probably
have
gone
to
sleep
the
next
morning
i
and
was
ten
minutes
late
for
breakfast
thereby
incurring
a
lecture
from
the
matron
but
i
could
not
refrain
from
remarking
to
her
that
i
had
had
only
two
hours
sleep
since
sunday
until
that
night
and
she
said
what
you
mean
nurse
and
then
it
came
out
that
when
she
sent
me
to
quarantine
she
had
quite
forgotten
that
i
had
been
on
for
those
two
nights
but
i
had
to
relieve
in
quarantine
again
that
night
in
spite
of
it
of
course
none
of
us
ever
mind
doing
extra
duty
when
it
is
necessary
but
there
were
plenty
of
others
who
might
have
done
it
and
got
their
full
amount
of
time
as
well
since
then
i
have
been
working
in
several
different
wards
and
there
are
so
many
new
nurses
who
have
come
since
i
did
that
i
am
generally
first
probationer
now
and
it
is
far
more
interesting
and
when
the
staff
nurse
is
off
duty
i
take
her
place
matron
has
been
quite
civil
to
me
lately
so
i
suppose
my
reports
have
been
all
right
as
i
believe
she
disliked
me
very
much
at
first
and
did
not
take
much
trouble
not
to
show
it
just
now
i
am
again
in
the
department
as
sister
has
been
called
home
on
account
of
illness
and
i
am
working
it
with
another
probationer
and
with
no
sister
the
other
probationer
is
two
weeks
senior
to
me
but
she
has
not
been
down
in
the
before
so
we
are
not
quite
clear
which
of
us
is
in
command
at
present
i
make
her
take
the
lead
on
medical
days
and
i
do
on
the
surgical
days
as
i
am
more
used
to
the
surgeons
and
their
ways
and
we
get
along
very
well
i
shall
very
soon
have
finished
my
year
here
and
have
been
very
much
exercised
over
the
question
of
what
i
had
better
do
next
one
of
the
sisters
that
i
have
liked
here
has
been
appointed
matron
of
a
small
children
hospital
and
she
has
offered
me
a
post
as
staff
nurse
this
was
very
kind
of
her
but
on
the
whole
i
think
i
would
rather
get
my
adult
training
before
i
do
anything
else
as
i
am
afraid
it
would
be
rather
hard
to
begin
at
the
beginning
again
if
i
went
on
to
being
a
staff
nurse
with
children
the
matron
advises
me
to
take
a
good
long
rest
before
beginning
in
an
adult
hospital
as
i
have
got
very
thin
and
run
down
of
late
and
i
am
still
a
year
too
young
to
be
received
at
the
best
hospitals
so
it
is
just
possible
i
may
accept
an
invitation
from
my
eldest
brother
to
go
out
to
him
for
a
year
in
south
africa
in
the
meantime
i
am
gathering
all
information
about
the
london
hospitals
and
am
to
visit
two
or
three
of
them
for
interviews
with
the
matrons
before
i
leave
here
i
have
passed
my
exams
all
right
so
my
first
certificate
is
fairly
safe
for
many
reasons
i
shall
be
very
sorry
to
leave
here
but
oh
i
am
so
tired
and
to
think
of
being
able
to
stay
in
bed
till
i
feel
i
want
to
get
up
is
a
joy
indeed
vii
kimberley
south
africa
when
i
last
wrote
to
you
i
was
still
a
humble
often
a
weary
hungry
and
but
withal
a
happy
one
and
i
hope
one
day
to
be
a
pro
again
but
for
the
present
times
have
changed
i
have
come
out
to
stay
with
my
brother
who
is
the
here
he
has
lived
here
for
the
last
eleven
or
twelve
years
but
this
year
there
is
a
great
exhibition
in
kimberley
so
he
has
taken
a
larger
house
for
the
time
being
and
will
be
able
to
entertain
a
few
friends
who
will
be
coming
up
for
the
exhibition
i
left
southampton
in
june
on
the
and
had
a
very
pleasant
voyage
out
in
good
weather
i
suppose
people
are
always
especially
kind
to
a
lone
lady
on
board
ship
at
any
rate
i
had
a
very
good
time
there
were
not
many
passengers
on
board
only
gentlemen
in
the
first
class
and
seventeen
ladies
so
i
had
a
nice
big
cabin
to
myself
the
is
the
only
steamer
on
that
line
and
it
was
lucky
she
had
a
twin
screw
as
when
i
woke
up
the
first
morning
out
from
southampton
there
was
a
strange
silence
on
board
and
when
i
got
on
deck
i
found
there
had
been
an
explosion
in
the
and
the
top
of
the
valve
was
blown
off
there
was
some
talk
of
having
to
signal
for
a
steamer
to
tow
us
into
brest
but
after
awhile
the
engineers
concluded
they
could
patch
up
matters
and
we
could
proceed
with
one
screw
working
this
reduced
our
speed
but
i
did
not
mind
that
at
all
the
bay
behaved
very
nicely
and
i
did
not
miss
a
meal
in
the
saloon
all
the
way
out
we
had
a
few
hours
ashore
at
madeira
while
they
were
coaling
and
overhauling
the
damaged
machinery
and
the
flowers
and
fruit
were
beautiful
as
ever
the
men
and
boys
swarmed
round
the
steamer
in
little
boats
and
would
dive
into
the
sea
for
silver
coins
thrown
overboard
one
or
two
of
them
could
dive
down
under
our
ship
and
come
up
on
the
other
side
the
next
day
we
passed
the
canary
islands
and
had
a
good
view
of
my
old
friend
the
peak
of
tenerife
we
had
the
usual
entertainments
two
dances
the
stewards
make
a
very
good
band
several
concerts
an
amusing
trial
by
jury
of
one
of
the
passengers
sports
for
the
passengers
and
for
the
crew
plenty
of
cricket
and
other
games
this
is
the
programme
for
one
day
from
my
diary
seven
salt
tub
on
deck
tramp
and
talk
and
then
read
breakfast
excitement
over
the
sweepstakes
on
the
ship
run
read
prepare
programmes
for
the
concert
at
night
hunt
up
people
to
sing
watch
a
whale
and
fire
and
boat
drill
by
the
crew
lunch
sleep
play
cricket
tea
choir
practice
tramp
and
talk
dinner
concert
tramp
and
talk
and
watch
the
phosphorescence
and
look
for
the
southern
cross
till
then
bed
and
as
sound
a
sleep
as
though
i
had
done
a
day
work
a
with
pleasant
people
on
board
and
not
too
rough
a
sea
is
the
most
restful
way
of
taking
a
holiday
i
can
imagine
it
was
very
damp
and
hot
crossing
the
line
and
the
cabins
became
so
stuffy
that
sleep
at
night
was
somewhat
difficult
but
one
could
make
up
for
that
by
sleeping
a
few
hours
in
the
day
when
up
on
deck
all
too
soon
we
anchored
in
table
bay
under
the
shelter
of
table
mountain
many
people
are
disappointed
in
their
first
view
of
table
mountain
but
it
has
a
grandeur
all
its
own
and
it
grows
upon
you
my
brother
was
unable
to
meet
me
as
he
had
intended
but
a
friend
of
his
came
on
board
a
gentleman
who
was
down
in
cape
town
for
the
session
of
parliament
and
i
found
it
was
arranged
for
me
to
spend
a
day
or
two
with
him
and
his
family
at
sea
point
a
suburb
of
cape
town
before
continuing
my
journey
up
country
having
come
nearly
miles
alone
it
did
not
seem
to
make
a
great
deal
of
odds
having
to
do
another
miles
alone
but
i
was
glad
of
a
few
days
rest
with
pleasant
people
i
had
made
so
many
friends
on
board
the
ship
that
it
was
quite
sad
to
say
to
them
all
and
i
had
more
than
one
kind
invitation
to
stay
with
people
in
different
parts
of
south
africa
the
day
after
we
landed
i
was
taken
to
hear
a
debate
in
the
house
of
parliament
on
the
deceased
wife
sister
bill
the
people
i
was
staying
with
went
on
to
a
reception
at
government
house
and
wanted
to
take
me
with
them
but
i
begged
off
not
having
unpacked
suitable
garments
it
is
very
pretty
all
round
cape
town
and
i
hope
to
see
more
of
it
before
i
return
home
then
one
evening
at
i
was
seen
off
from
cape
town
station
and
was
once
more
a
traveller
on
my
own
account
but
not
under
such
comfortable
conditions
as
on
board
ship
i
learnt
that
the
dining
and
sleeping
cars
were
attached
to
the
trains
only
on
one
night
of
the
week
the
night
the
come
in
so
i
went
in
an
ordinary
carriage
the
ticket
costing
me
more
than
and
found
the
seats
were
covered
with
and
by
no
means
comfortable
for
a
night
journey
above
the
seat
there
is
a
shelf
which
lets
down
at
night
so
that
four
people
can
secure
room
in
each
carriage
i
soon
learnt
also
that
in
this
country
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
the
month
of
july
it
was
also
the
middle
of
winter
and
as
we
got
up
to
higher
altitudes
it
became
intensely
cold
i
had
the
carriage
to
myself
at
first
and
having
piled
on
all
the
clothes
i
had
with
me
i
was
trying
to
sleep
when
about
two
old
dutch
ladies
were
put
in
with
me
and
for
the
rest
of
the
night
they
chattered
and
ate
cheese
and
apples
and
onions
so
that
sleep
was
impossible
until
they
left
the
train
at
matjesfontein
i
am
told
the
scenery
we
passed
through
that
night
is
very
grand
i
hope
some
time
to
see
it
under
more
favourable
conditions
cold
and
hungry
about
we
stopped
for
breakfast
at
matjesfontein
i
took
my
and
towel
thinking
i
should
find
a
but
all
i
found
was
a
tap
on
the
platform
where
we
took
our
turn
at
a
splash
in
water
and
then
went
on
to
a
tin
shanty
where
breakfast
was
served
kippers
good
bread
indifferent
butter
and
moderate
tea
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
hurry
but
when
we
had
all
finished
and
the
engine
had
had
a
drink
and
the
had
lit
his
pipe
we
started
off
again
and
all
that
day
we
strolled
across
the
karroo
stopping
apparently
just
when
the
driver
felt
inclined
and
when
there
was
a
hill
going
so
slowly
one
felt
tempted
to
jump
off
and
take
a
little
exercise
by
running
alongside
it
was
very
grey
and
brown
this
wonderful
karroo
country
with
occasional
kopjes
hills
with
great
boulders
of
stones
up
the
sides
and
now
and
then
a
river
or
a
stream
and
always
by
any
water
a
green
line
of
the
mimosa
trees
covered
with
their
yellow
flower
as
the
sun
grew
stronger
i
began
to
forget
the
discomforts
of
the
night
and
some
pleasant
dutch
people
came
on
board
and
told
me
many
interesting
things
about
the
country
we
were
passing
through
then
i
was
introduced
to
my
first
swarm
of
locusts
a
weird
sight
it
was
too
they
were
pointed
out
to
me
first
when
they
were
some
miles
ahead
of
us
and
looked
like
a
small
black
cloud
then
as
they
came
near
the
sky
seemed
to
become
black
with
them
and
we
had
to
shut
all
the
windows
or
the
carriage
would
soon
have
been
full
of
them
they
tell
me
sometimes
the
young
ones
settle
on
the
lines
in
such
masses
and
the
lines
become
so
slippery
the
trains
ca
get
on
and
the
men
have
to
turn
out
and
shovel
them
off
fancy
a
great
northern
express
being
held
up
by
a
swarm
of
locusts
for
most
of
the
way
the
old
ran
alongside
the
railway
and
was
marked
out
by
the
skeletons
of
horses
and
oxen
or
the
sadder
sight
of
a
mound
of
stones
with
a
little
wooden
cross
where
some
poor
fellow
had
fallen
by
the
way
we
stopped
at
victoria
west
for
dinner
and
as
there
was
another
train
from
up
country
in
the
station
we
were
halted
well
out
on
the
veldt
and
i
had
to
stumble
along
to
the
station
and
then
across
what
seemed
in
the
darkness
to
be
a
rickyard
to
the
tin
shanty
where
dinner
was
served
i
was
the
only
lady
there
but
i
had
only
had
a
snack
lunch
on
board
the
train
and
we
were
more
than
an
hour
later
than
we
had
expected
to
dine
so
i
was
too
hungry
to
mind
much
and
had
a
very
good
dinner
there
is
only
a
single
line
for
all
this
long
track
so
the
delays
to
allow
trains
to
pass
at
the
stations
are
numerous
and
it
is
well
never
to
travel
without
a
supply
of
chocolate
as
the
meals
are
very
movable
feasts
i
managed
to
sleep
through
that
night
as
it
was
not
so
cold
and
i
had
the
carriage
to
myself
early
the
next
morning
we
steamed
into
kimberley
and
my
brother
met
me
at
the
station
viii
kimberley
south
africa
two
things
are
prominent
in
my
mind
the
first
is
that
the
thermometer
is
at
in
the
shade
and
the
mosquitoes
are
perfectly
vicious
and
the
second
is
that
the
kimberley
exhibition
with
its
round
of
gaieties
is
actually
closed
but
before
i
tell
you
about
this
exhibition
i
must
try
to
go
back
and
give
you
a
few
first
impressions
of
the
diamond
fields
as
you
come
into
kimberley
by
train
you
first
pass
the
kaffir
location
and
instead
of
the
picturesque
dwellings
that
one
sees
in
pictures
you
see
an
exceedingly
untidy
collection
of
huts
built
of
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
bits
of
galvanized
iron
old
paraffin
tins
then
come
small
tin
shanties
inhabited
by
the
poor
whites
and
so
the
houses
improve
as
one
nears
the
centre
of
the
town
we
drove
down
from
the
station
in
a
cape
cart
which
takes
the
place
of
a
fly
here
it
is
a
comfortable
kind
of
with
two
wheels
drawn
by
a
pair
of
horses
it
has
a
movable
hood
and
the
four
passengers
all
sit
facing
the
horse
tail
the
most
comfortable
seats
are
at
the
back
and
part
of
the
driver
seat
lifts
up
on
a
hinge
while
you
get
to
the
back
seat
i
found
my
brother
had
taken
a
house
and
bought
all
the
furniture
in
it
so
there
was
not
much
difficulty
about
settling
in
except
hanging
our
own
pictures
and
buying
a
little
more
linen
plate
it
was
a
nice
bungalow
with
the
usual
roof
and
a
shady
balcony
called
here
a
stoep
all
the
way
round
the
house
so
that
one
could
generally
find
a
fairly
cool
place
to
sit
he
had
also
secured
a
very
good
white
woman
as
cook
and
a
dusky
zulu
called
george
who
waited
at
table
and
generally
fagged
for
the
cook
george
looked
about
fifteen
so
i
treated
him
as
i
would
a
boy
of
eleven
or
twelve
and
he
was
soon
my
most
devoted
slave
but
one
day
i
asked
him
how
old
he
was
and
he
said
i
was
last
census
missus
but
i
shall
continue
to
treat
him
in
the
same
way
as
it
seems
to
answer
well
and
after
all
i
think
these
blacks
will
always
be
rather
like
children
however
old
they
are
i
find
he
has
a
wife
at
a
kraal
up
country
and
he
is
now
saving
up
to
buy
some
cows
wherewith
to
secure
another
wife
i
understand
the
present
value
of
a
nice
kaffir
girl
is
seven
cows
there
is
a
large
compound
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
thrown
in
with
the
house
we
found
two
dogs
a
dignified
cat
and
some
fowls
and
turkeys
at
first
i
thought
the
kimberley
people
were
rather
uninteresting
and
felt
inclined
to
agree
with
the
barber
who
when
he
was
giving
me
a
most
refreshing
and
shampoo
after
the
dusty
journey
up
said
you
think
the
ladies
here
funny
miss
for
they
absolutely
never
talk
about
anything
but
their
dresses
but
poor
things
there
was
very
little
else
to
talk
about
every
one
was
kind
in
coming
to
call
and
i
soon
found
some
very
nice
people
amongst
them
sunday
is
the
great
day
for
all
the
gentlemen
to
call
and
sometimes
we
had
eight
or
nine
men
dropping
in
on
sunday
afternoon
and
generally
one
or
two
came
in
to
supper
after
church
there
is
a
splendid
library
nearly
opposite
the
club
which
is
also
a
fine
building
and
i
very
much
appreciate
the
cool
with
all
the
english
papers
and
magazines
only
about
a
month
old
we
play
a
good
deal
of
tennis
on
gravel
courts
there
are
two
days
in
the
week
when
ladies
can
play
at
the
club
and
some
people
who
have
private
courts
have
regular
days
so
that
i
generally
play
three
or
four
afternoons
a
week
just
lately
i
have
had
some
good
riding
as
a
young
lady
i
know
has
gone
down
to
the
cape
and
has
left
a
nice
and
young
horse
behind
her
mother
offered
to
lend
it
to
me
one
day
and
i
had
a
glorious
gallop
over
the
veldt
with
their
groom
and
then
a
kind
note
came
saying
that
i
was
doing
them
a
great
favour
by
exercising
the
horse
as
it
was
too
fresh
for
the
younger
girls
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
do
a
favour
so
easily
and
we
make
up
very
pleasant
little
riding
parties
i
think
the
thing
one
misses
most
in
kimberley
is
water
if
you
ride
or
drive
you
may
find
some
out
at
the
waterworks
or
a
variable
amount
in
the
river
out
at
alexanderfontein
but
the
water
you
can
find
within
walking
distance
might
be
measured
in
bucketsful
and
the
men
are
fond
of
talking
of
the
early
days
when
it
was
cheaper
to
have
a
bath
in
than
in
plain
water
and
of
a
notice
that
was
said
to
have
been
put
up
in
a
hotel
please
do
not
use
soap
as
the
water
is
required
for
tea
in
the
season
with
careful
watering
one
can
grow
a
good
many
flowers
roses
do
especially
well
and
some
people
who
are
diligent
with
the
cultivate
a
small
piece
of
grass
but
a
few
days
neglect
or
a
few
hours
visitation
from
a
flight
of
locusts
and
your
treasured
piece
of
grass
is
as
though
a
prairie
fire
had
been
over
it
of
course
there
was
much
excitement
up
here
about
the
opening
of
the
exhibition
the
governor
and
family
came
up
from
cape
town
for
the
ceremony
and
stayed
nearly
a
fortnight
in
house
which
he
gave
up
to
them
and
there
was
much
entertaining
we
had
the
colonial
secretary
and
his
wife
staying
with
us
and
also
a
daughter
of
the
governor
of
bechuanaland
as
was
the
minister
in
attendance
on
the
governor
he
had
to
bring
his
secretary
with
him
and
the
police
superintendent
posted
a
mounted
orderly
at
our
gate
to
take
his
messages
about
so
we
felt
quite
important
many
interesting
people
from
all
over
south
africa
came
up
for
the
exhibition
and
i
am
afraid
i
sha
be
able
to
remember
all
those
to
whom
i
have
been
introduced
cecil
rhodes
was
here
for
a
few
days
and
we
went
to
supper
with
him
one
sunday
evening
he
is
generally
supposed
to
dislike
ladies
but
if
that
is
true
he
does
not
show
it
there
were
not
many
there
and
i
sat
next
to
him
at
supper
i
believe
it
was
a
very
good
supper
but
the
conversation
was
so
interesting
all
about
south
africa
and
south
africans
i
could
attend
to
it
and
i
went
home
hungry
and
had
to
have
a
private
snack
before
i
went
to
bed
the
morning
after
the
governor
arrived
we
received
an
invitation
to
dine
at
government
house
that
evening
and
it
was
rather
awkward
as
we
had
a
dinner
party
here
but
and
went
off
to
call
and
explain
matters
and
we
were
excused
they
gave
two
huge
garden
parties
which
we
attended
and
i
enjoyed
them
very
much
both
the
governor
and
lady
so
very
pleasant
and
friendly
another
day
they
were
the
guests
of
de
beers
and
we
also
were
invited
so
we
saw
all
the
process
of
under
very
comfortable
circumstances
the
blue
stone
as
it
was
brought
up
from
the
mines
in
little
trucks
and
laid
out
in
the
sun
surrounded
by
fences
to
pulverize
then
collected
and
crushed
and
washed
and
then
we
went
into
the
and
were
given
trowels
to
sort
with
and
i
found
four
nice
diamonds
in
ten
minutes
and
should
like
to
have
kept
them
then
to
the
and
saw
diamonds
bags
and
bags
of
them
afterwards
we
drove
out
to
kenilworth
the
model
village
all
planned
by
cecil
rhodes
for
the
de
beers
men
such
nice
little
houses
with
water
laid
on
and
every
convenience
a
good
garden
to
each
house
a
school
and
a
a
recreation
ground
and
then
miles
of
grapes
peaches
apricots
that
rhodes
has
planted
and
has
had
carefully
irrigated
one
could
hardly
believe
it
was
so
near
to
kimberley
and
kimberley
dust
every
day
at
the
exhibition
there
was
a
good
band
playing
and
every
evening
some
fireworks
and
other
entertainments
cricket
matches
played
on
a
pitch
of
cocoanut
matting
tennis
tournaments
were
the
order
of
the
day
so
that
now
when
the
governor
and
other
visitors
have
returned
to
the
cape
and
the
exhibition
is
closed
you
can
understand
that
kimberley
seems
a
little
flat
and
i
am
much
looking
forward
to
a
run
down
to
the
cape
next
month
by
way
of
a
change
ix
kenilworth
nr
cape
town
here
we
are
amidst
lovely
greenery
and
flowers
with
the
cooing
in
the
garden
and
with
the
very
blue
sea
on
one
side
and
grand
old
table
mountain
towering
above
us
on
the
other
kimberley
was
really
a
very
warm
place
before
we
left
it
we
had
had
several
bad
when
you
shut
up
all
the
doors
and
windows
and
still
the
dust
comes
through
and
settles
in
inches
on
the
furniture
and
everything
you
touch
or
taste
is
dusty
one
of
the
worst
and
the
hottest
of
days
was
christmas
day
we
had
invited
a
few
lonely
men
to
dinner
and
when
i
came
in
to
dress
george
met
me
at
the
door
and
said
missus
kitchen
window
all
gone
dinner
no
good
and
when
i
went
to
investigate
i
found
poor
stanley
nearly
weeping
as
the
window
had
been
blown
completely
in
frame
and
all
on
to
the
table
at
which
she
was
preparing
our
dinner
and
the
dignified
cat
was
licking
up
the
custard
on
the
floor
fortunately
the
turkey
was
saved
and
with
the
help
of
a
few
extra
tins
we
scraped
together
a
fairly
good
dinner
i
do
know
what
would
become
of
the
people
in
kimberley
if
they
were
afraid
to
eat
tinned
foods
besides
the
dust
and
my
old
enemies
the
mosquitoes
the
flies
were
very
horrible
they
settle
everywhere
and
it
is
necessary
to
keep
everything
very
well
covered
up
you
have
to
shoo
them
off
the
sugar
before
you
help
yourself
and
if
you
venture
to
put
some
honey
or
jam
on
your
bread
it
is
ten
to
one
there
is
at
least
one
fly
on
it
before
it
reaches
your
mouth
well
we
left
kimberley
still
gasping
for
rain
and
the
train
strolled
down
to
the
cape
in
two
days
and
one
night
the
scenery
we
passed
through
on
the
second
day
was
very
fine
indeed
all
through
the
hex
river
pass
i
saw
a
good
many
baboons
one
little
chap
scuttled
away
and
then
sat
down
and
threw
stones
at
us
a
most
quaint
little
beast
he
looked
in
a
fury
of
a
temper
met
us
at
the
station
and
they
have
such
a
delightful
house
and
garden
you
have
no
idea
what
a
rest
it
is
to
see
plenty
of
greenery
again
after
all
the
sun
and
glare
of
kimberley
all
the
people
about
here
seem
to
be
so
very
pleasant
and
friendly
i
am
enjoying
myself
immensely
we
went
to
dinner
one
night
at
government
house
i
was
shy
at
the
prospect
of
going
but
it
was
really
very
jolly
i
went
in
to
dinner
with
captain
of
now
at
simonstown
and
he
was
very
entertaining
the
men
were
all
in
naval
military
or
court
dress
and
they
looked
so
nice
another
day
gave
a
picnic
at
constantia
the
government
wine
farm
and
the
governor
and
party
joined
us
there
it
was
a
very
pretty
place
and
after
tea
we
went
for
a
scramble
up
a
ravine
to
pick
blackberries
part
of
the
way
up
i
was
trying
to
disentangle
lady
from
a
bramble
when
the
governor
turned
round
and
called
to
her
hurry
up
my
dear
hurry
up
and
she
replied
but
dear
i
caught
by
my
hair
so
he
had
to
return
to
assist
and
then
coming
down
he
twice
fell
down
and
each
time
pretended
he
had
sat
down
only
to
admire
the
view
on
sunday
we
went
over
to
simonstown
to
call
on
the
admiral
wife
there
were
two
captains
of
calling
and
some
other
officers
and
they
invited
us
to
visit
them
on
their
ships
but
could
not
spare
a
day
i
was
rather
disappointed
cecil
rhodes
was
away
but
we
walked
over
to
see
his
place
groot
schuur
it
is
a
very
lovely
and
peaceful
spot
just
at
the
foot
of
table
mountain
and
with
lovely
views
in
all
directions
the
hydrangeas
that
he
is
so
fond
of
are
quite
a
sight
they
grow
up
the
sides
of
a
hollow
glen
in
the
grounds
and
the
mass
of
different
shades
is
very
beautiful
another
day
we
went
to
lunch
with
the
chief
justice
at
wynberg
such
a
lovely
place
he
has
with
many
beautiful
trees
in
the
grounds
amongst
others
they
have
a
good
many
of
the
silver
trees
which
grow
up
table
mountain
and
i
believe
nowhere
else
in
the
world
in
the
afternoon
lady
drove
us
to
a
huge
garden
party
at
newlands
government
house
i
heard
that
invitations
had
been
sent
out
and
i
should
think
most
of
them
had
been
accepted
but
there
was
still
plenty
of
room
and
the
grounds
are
beautiful
and
there
was
a
good
band
playing
one
of
khama
sons
was
there
but
i
did
not
meet
him
my
brother
was
anxious
to
have
a
little
so
we
stayed
for
a
few
days
at
a
small
place
called
muizenberg
on
the
shore
of
false
bay
i
have
never
bathed
in
such
deliciously
warm
water
before
i
believe
there
are
some
sharks
around
table
bay
but
false
bay
is
considered
quite
safe
so
many
cape
town
people
go
out
there
to
bathe
and
some
of
them
have
bungalows
near
the
sea
i
was
very
keen
to
climb
table
mountain
so
i
left
for
one
night
at
muizenberg
and
went
to
spend
the
night
again
at
kenilworth
with
some
friends
who
were
making
up
a
mountain
party
we
were
up
early
and
left
in
cape
carts
a
party
of
eight
at
and
drove
round
to
hout
bay
neck
most
unfortunately
it
was
a
cloudy
morning
and
the
mountain
is
said
to
be
dangerous
in
a
fog
but
we
kept
hoping
it
would
clear
and
we
began
the
climb
at
it
was
fairly
steep
but
never
really
a
difficult
climb
when
we
got
to
the
ranger
cottage
we
found
he
had
just
killed
a
horrid
cobra
snake
that
measured
feet
inches
long
he
did
not
hold
out
any
hope
of
the
weather
clearing
but
as
we
had
gone
so
far
we
thought
we
might
as
well
go
on
so
we
clambered
to
the
top
where
we
arrived
at
and
were
greatly
disappointed
not
to
get
any
view
the
only
compensations
were
the
flowers
we
found
which
were
simply
lovely
huge
white
heather
and
everlastings
and
many
flowers
which
i
had
never
seen
before
coming
down
in
the
afternoon
it
was
blowing
and
cold
and
at
one
place
we
missed
the
path
and
for
about
a
mile
had
to
force
our
way
through
some
thick
and
very
wet
undergrowth
and
then
it
began
to
rain
so
we
were
rather
a
party
when
we
reached
the
carts
and
the
drive
home
in
our
wet
garments
was
not
exactly
comfortable
this
may
not
sound
as
though
we
had
a
very
enjoyable
expedition
and
yet
i
really
did
enjoy
the
day
very
much
the
people
were
all
so
jolly
and
made
fun
of
all
the
discomforts
major
the
governor
secretary
was
one
of
the
party
and
he
had
provided
himself
with
pins
needles
bandages
sticking
plaster
and
all
sorts
of
other
things
most
of
which
came
in
useful
in
the
course
of
the
day
i
heard
afterwards
that
he
told
the
governor
that
he
had
never
done
such
a
hard
day
work
before
as
we
made
him
walk
for
eleven
and
a
half
hours
and
only
let
him
sit
down
for
half
an
hour
the
time
has
gone
so
quickly
down
here
as
there
has
been
so
much
going
on
and
every
one
has
been
so
kind
we
have
had
about
twice
as
many
invitations
as
we
could
accept
now
we
are
packing
up
to
return
to
kimberley
and
as
they
have
had
some
good
rains
up
there
i
hope
we
shall
find
it
a
little
cooled
down
if
only
we
could
take
some
of
this
lovely
greenery
with
us
you
have
no
idea
how
grateful
you
ought
to
be
in
england
that
you
can
always
find
a
green
field
if
you
go
to
look
for
it
instead
of
perpetual
greyness
and
brownness
and
glare
soon
after
we
get
back
will
have
to
start
off
on
circuit
in
the
colony
and
i
am
hoping
to
go
part
of
the
way
with
him
and
then
to
start
off
on
an
expedition
to
visit
some
friends
up
country
in
natal
they
are
fifty
miles
from
a
railway
i
am
looking
forward
to
this
tremendously
and
then
soon
after
it
will
be
time
for
me
to
make
tracks
for
home
as
i
have
now
nearly
reached
the
venerable
age
of
and
am
therefore
eligible
for
beginning
my
training
in
an
adult
hospital
and
though
this
sort
of
life
is
very
jolly
for
a
time
i
should
not
like
it
for
always
it
is
not
so
satisfying
as
useful
work
i
am
quite
sad
at
saying
to
all
my
friends
i
believe
one
makes
real
friends
more
easily
out
here
than
one
does
in
england
it
must
be
something
in
the
air
x
greytown
natal
after
my
last
letter
to
you
we
journeyed
back
over
the
seven
hundred
odd
miles
to
kimberley
and
found
life
up
there
a
little
flat
after
the
gay
time
we
had
been
having
at
the
cape
but
i
had
some
good
tennis
and
riding
and
then
we
had
to
prepare
for
the
circuit
at
each
place
that
the
judge
visits
he
has
to
do
a
little
entertaining
so
he
has
to
take
a
cook
and
a
butler
with
him
and
as
some
of
the
places
where
courts
are
held
are
quite
villages
he
has
to
take
a
certain
amount
of
groceries
along
too
and
of
course
wine
the
government
provide
a
saloon
carriage
with
a
small
kitchen
on
board
so
that
is
used
as
the
judge
headquarters
when
near
the
railway
lines
but
many
of
the
places
visited
entail
long
drives
in
cape
carts
the
first
place
we
went
to
was
colesberg
and
we
arrived
there
at
we
were
quite
a
large
party
with
the
barristers
the
clerk
and
registrar
the
interpreter
and
the
servants
we
were
met
by
the
magistrate
and
the
sheriff
with
a
smart
escort
of
cape
mounted
police
and
a
party
of
convicts
to
take
the
baggage
up
we
found
a
nice
little
house
ready
for
us
the
owner
having
turned
out
to
make
room
and
after
a
wash
and
breakfast
the
men
all
went
off
to
the
court
and
i
stayed
to
unpack
and
get
things
straight
there
were
three
coloured
girls
left
to
do
the
housework
none
of
them
could
speak
english
and
they
had
several
babies
scattered
about
i
knew
we
had
to
give
a
dinner
party
before
we
left
and
felt
rather
hopeless
about
how
it
would
go
with
the
material
to
hand
however
everything
went
off
very
well
in
the
end
lots
of
people
called
on
me
and
i
had
some
good
tennis
at
the
club
and
also
some
nice
rides
on
a
horse
that
was
lent
to
me
the
first
one
i
have
tried
since
i
came
to
this
country
that
had
a
good
mouth
most
of
them
are
ruined
with
the
bits
they
use
the
surrounding
country
was
rather
pretty
and
good
for
corn
and
cattle
we
stayed
four
days
at
colesberg
and
then
moved
on
to
craddock
ten
hours
on
the
railway
there
was
a
lot
of
court
work
there
and
it
had
to
be
fitted
into
five
days
so
the
men
were
in
court
nearly
all
the
time
one
night
up
to
and
i
found
it
a
little
slow
but
i
had
some
nice
drives
one
day
going
out
to
see
some
curious
sulphur
baths
and
another
day
to
a
farm
about
eight
miles
off
where
every
imaginable
kind
of
fruit
seemed
to
grow
after
this
we
parted
company
my
brother
going
on
to
middleburg
and
i
for
another
run
of
ten
hours
in
the
train
to
port
elizabeth
where
i
joined
the
for
durban
various
people
seemed
to
have
asked
the
captain
to
take
care
of
me
so
i
sat
next
to
him
at
table
and
he
was
most
kind
when
he
found
that
i
meant
to
put
up
at
a
hotel
in
durban
he
told
me
that
he
would
let
me
do
that
as
he
had
lots
of
friends
there
and
i
should
have
a
much
better
time
if
i
went
to
stay
with
them
we
got
to
east
london
next
day
the
sea
was
rather
rough
and
there
was
a
lot
of
cargo
to
get
on
board
so
we
were
there
some
time
but
i
go
ashore
when
we
had
again
got
under
way
the
captain
came
up
to
me
and
said
i
have
wired
to
some
people
in
durban
to
ask
them
to
meet
you
when
we
get
there
was
it
not
kind
of
him
when
we
reached
durban
i
waited
till
the
captain
was
ready
to
go
ashore
and
then
we
got
into
a
kind
of
huge
and
were
swung
over
the
side
and
into
the
tender
as
these
big
steamers
ca
get
into
the
harbour
and
when
we
had
come
alongside
the
wharf
we
found
two
ladies
waiting
for
us
with
a
sweet
pair
of
ponies
they
assured
me
it
was
quite
all
right
and
that
they
really
had
lots
of
room
and
the
captain
was
to
come
up
to
lunch
so
off
we
drove
to
such
a
nice
house
up
on
the
berea
with
a
lovely
view
right
over
the
harbour
they
were
very
pleasant
scotch
people
and
they
so
kind
to
me
driving
me
about
to
see
the
town
i
stayed
the
night
with
them
and
all
the
next
day
as
there
was
no
train
till
and
then
they
saw
me
off
and
made
me
promise
to
visit
them
on
my
way
back
i
got
to
pietermaritzburg
at
i
believe
it
is
very
fine
scenery
on
the
way
up
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
it
and
stayed
a
night
at
a
hotel
where
i
found
that
my
kind
durban
friends
had
wired
to
the
proprietress
to
look
after
me
so
everything
was
very
comfortable
i
was
up
early
the
next
morning
to
have
a
look
round
maritzburg
and
made
friends
with
the
driver
of
the
who
promised
me
the
john
was
quite
a
character
and
he
entertained
me
well
for
all
the
miles
we
drove
that
day
we
got
away
at
with
six
tough
little
horses
and
the
funniest
old
noah
ark
of
a
coach
you
ever
saw
the
road
was
very
rough
and
there
were
very
steep
bits
down
to
rivers
or
spruits
as
they
are
called
here
and
then
a
hard
pull
up
the
other
side
we
changed
horses
several
times
and
some
of
the
teams
were
very
raw
and
wild
and
the
leaders
were
sometimes
inclined
to
turn
round
and
come
to
see
how
the
were
getting
on
so
john
had
to
use
his
huge
whip
at
times
and
i
had
to
cling
on
and
i
got
so
bumped
about
that
i
was
stiff
for
days
afterwards
john
had
many
interesting
stories
to
tell
having
been
a
for
us
in
the
zulu
war
my
friends
met
me
a
mile
or
two
outside
greytown
with
a
in
which
we
drove
up
to
their
farm
such
a
delightful
old
house
it
really
belongs
to
father
but
he
is
in
england
now
where
they
have
some
children
at
school
so
they
have
come
up
from
their
smaller
house
in
greytown
to
take
care
of
the
farm
i
have
been
here
a
fortnight
now
and
have
enjoyed
every
minute
of
it
for
one
thing
the
climate
is
delightful
it
is
pretty
hot
but
not
the
damp
heat
you
find
near
the
coast
nor
the
dusty
heat
of
kimberley
so
i
am
feeling
very
fit
and
the
people
so
nice
i
should
like
to
stay
for
months
it
is
a
very
life
and
we
are
waited
upon
by
a
man
in
a
shirt
and
an
apron
of
cats
tails
it
is
very
pretty
country
and
i
am
having
delightful
rides
on
a
good
horse
one
day
we
rode
out
to
see
some
people
who
live
fifteen
miles
away
from
here
and
they
insisted
upon
our
staying
the
night
of
course
they
do
get
many
visitors
out
there
the
next
morning
we
rode
on
to
a
place
where
we
got
a
splendid
view
over
what
they
call
the
thorne
country
right
into
zululand
we
could
see
the
mooi
river
valley
and
they
pointed
out
to
me
where
the
defence
of
rorke
drift
saved
natal
i
had
never
been
inside
a
kaffir
hut
so
we
went
one
day
to
explore
and
i
was
taken
to
call
upon
sixpence
a
zulu
who
works
here
we
had
to
crawl
into
the
wattle
and
straw
hut
on
our
hands
and
knees
and
at
first
i
could
not
see
anything
and
could
hardly
breathe
as
the
only
escape
for
the
smoke
from
their
fire
is
through
the
doorway
but
we
squatted
down
on
the
floor
which
looked
clean
and
polished
with
much
sitting
upon
and
soon
i
made
out
sixpence
sixpence
can
only
afford
one
wife
with
a
blanket
draped
around
her
and
four
children
the
baby
was
absolutely
naked
and
the
other
children
were
chiefly
clad
in
beads
and
then
there
was
sixpence
mother
a
poor
old
thing
who
is
over
a
hundred
and
can
remember
chaka
the
great
zulu
chief
i
have
collected
many
curios
while
staying
here
and
the
other
day
i
was
given
the
skin
of
a
huge
python
feet
long
which
had
been
shot
near
to
the
house
not
long
before
i
ca
bear
snakes
and
creeping
beasts
and
there
are
a
great
many
of
them
up
here
there
is
more
grass
than
there
is
in
cape
colony
and
so
better
cover
for
the
beasts
the
other
day
when
i
was
out
riding
my
horse
gave
a
great
jump
aside
and
after
i
had
remonstrated
with
him
i
looked
back
and
saw
a
horrid
snake
sitting
up
and
hissing
at
us
so
i
had
to
explain
to
my
gee
how
sorry
i
was
that
i
had
spoken
the
doctor
with
whom
i
am
staying
has
to
take
very
long
journeys
on
horseback
to
see
his
patients
he
seems
very
popular
and
often
has
to
go
to
kaffir
kraals
a
long
way
off
though
many
of
the
natives
still
stick
to
their
faith
in
the
and
their
weird
remedies
very
often
they
have
no
money
so
he
is
paid
in
kind
and
sometimes
he
returns
from
a
visit
to
a
chief
with
one
or
two
cows
which
he
has
to
drive
home
before
him
several
people
have
asked
me
to
stay
with
them
and
if
i
was
not
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
work
i
am
sure
i
could
put
in
several
months
up
here
with
much
enjoyment
the
natal
people
are
quite
delightful
and
so
hospitable
but
john
has
promised
me
the
on
his
noah
ark
again
on
tuesday
and
i
must
once
more
make
tracks
for
kimberley
xi
kimberley
south
africa
i
managed
my
journey
back
from
natal
very
comfortably
and
made
several
new
friends
on
the
way
the
drive
on
the
from
greytown
to
maritzburg
was
somewhat
perilous
as
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
about
so
that
good
horses
were
scarce
and
several
of
our
teams
were
very
raw
and
there
was
much
bucking
and
kicking
before
each
start
and
several
times
the
harness
broke
down
and
john
had
to
descend
to
make
repairs
i
am
sure
the
passengers
in
the
body
of
the
ark
were
terrified
lest
the
horses
should
take
it
into
their
heads
to
start
off
while
the
reins
were
entrusted
to
me
and
though
i
am
pretty
good
at
managing
a
horse
i
should
be
shy
of
trying
to
drive
six
of
these
bucking
creatures
however
we
got
safely
down
to
maritzburg
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
again
i
had
to
spend
a
night
there
taking
the
train
the
next
morning
for
durban
the
railway
between
these
two
towns
is
a
wonderful
piece
of
engineering
work
crawling
up
one
side
of
a
mountain
and
scuttling
down
the
other
very
fine
scenery
with
vegetation
all
the
way
down
my
good
durban
friends
again
met
me
and
were
most
kind
putting
me
up
for
the
night
and
then
seeing
me
off
on
the
rather
a
tub
of
a
coasting
vessel
that
gave
us
such
a
pitching
about
that
even
i
succumbed
and
was
this
greatly
annoyed
me
as
i
had
come
all
the
way
out
to
the
cape
without
a
qualm
i
had
meant
to
do
a
jaunt
up
from
east
london
to
visit
some
people
at
grahamstown
and
at
king
william
town
but
i
was
so
happy
at
greytown
that
i
stayed
on
longer
than
i
intended
and
had
to
give
up
the
other
visits
we
anchored
off
east
london
for
some
hours
and
the
captain
took
me
ashore
to
lunch
with
some
friends
of
his
and
they
took
us
for
a
nice
drive
round
the
town
and
out
to
a
place
called
cambridge
where
we
picked
oranges
and
lots
of
flowers
the
scenery
at
the
mouth
of
the
buffalo
river
is
very
pretty
then
we
went
on
to
port
elizabeth
and
the
captain
again
took
me
out
to
lunch
and
we
had
a
pleasant
day
exploring
the
town
with
some
of
his
friends
and
in
the
evening
they
saw
me
off
by
train
for
kimberley
the
train
was
rather
full
but
i
was
so
tired
that
i
slept
all
night
and
woke
up
only
just
in
time
to
get
some
breakfast
at
craddock
i
am
getting
quite
experienced
in
making
good
use
of
the
twenty
minutes
they
allow
you
to
get
meals
at
these
wayside
all
that
day
we
were
strolling
along
in
the
train
dinner
at
de
aar
junction
in
the
evening
and
at
the
next
morning
i
reached
kimberley
no
one
to
meet
me
and
no
cabs
so
i
left
my
baggage
with
a
porter
and
walked
down
to
our
house
peter
the
cat
was
holding
an
at
home
in
the
garden
and
carlo
the
retriever
was
on
the
stoep
to
welcome
me
and
assisted
me
to
find
the
key
under
the
doormat
and
i
was
glad
to
find
my
bed
ready
to
tumble
into
after
a
wash
it
is
winter
here
now
and
the
people
seem
rather
more
energetic
than
usual
i
have
been
to
two
dances
since
i
got
back
and
there
are
some
dinner
parties
in
prospect
the
other
day
i
went
down
a
diamond
mine
a
thing
visitors
do
often
do
though
of
course
a
good
many
see
all
the
workings
above
ground
i
had
to
dress
up
in
a
canvas
overall
suit
and
and
then
in
a
very
rough
cage
we
were
lowered
to
the
level
i
hear
they
will
soon
be
working
at
feet
below
the
surface
but
feet
is
the
depth
they
are
working
just
now
it
was
all
very
interesting
swarms
of
natives
with
very
little
on
and
the
fussy
little
trucks
rushing
about
with
their
loads
of
the
in
which
the
diamonds
are
found
but
i
was
rather
glad
to
get
back
to
the
daylight
again
then
on
sunday
afternoon
i
was
invited
to
go
and
see
a
by
the
zulus
in
the
mine
compound
it
was
really
very
fine
only
one
tribe
is
allowed
to
dance
at
a
time
or
there
would
soon
be
fighting
and
the
men
of
the
other
tribes
kept
away
at
the
far
end
of
the
compound
and
would
not
look
on
there
were
about
forty
zulus
dancing
they
were
dressed
in
little
aprons
of
cats
tails
and
a
few
beads
and
wore
feathers
on
their
heads
and
were
waving
skin
shields
and
knobkerries
sticks
with
weighted
knobs
they
all
stood
in
a
row
and
stamped
and
clapped
and
danced
and
sang
in
very
good
time
and
then
single
ones
stalked
out
in
front
of
the
others
and
throwing
themselves
into
extraordinary
attitudes
with
much
stuttering
and
stammering
they
recounted
the
great
deeds
they
had
done
in
war
and
the
others
all
chimed
in
with
great
hoos
and
hoofs
of
approval
stamping
on
the
ground
like
angry
bulls
some
of
these
men
fought
against
us
in
the
zulu
war
after
the
dance
was
over
one
very
line
fellow
was
introduced
to
us
as
the
man
who
had
carried
a
lot
of
englishmen
out
of
the
mine
when
it
was
on
fire
a
year
or
two
ago
i
think
it
is
a
wonderful
system
by
which
all
these
tribes
that
have
hated
each
other
for
generations
can
be
made
to
live
together
in
one
compound
working
side
by
side
and
earning
very
good
wages
they
have
separate
huts
and
messes
but
they
buy
at
the
same
store
and
share
the
same
chapel
hospital
and
there
are
about
men
in
the
compound
and
they
all
seemed
very
happy
no
beer
or
spirits
are
allowed
any
man
who
likes
can
learn
to
read
and
write
while
he
is
in
the
compound
and
many
of
them
were
sitting
round
the
fires
where
they
were
boiling
their
mealy
meal
reading
to
their
mates
we
went
into
the
hospital
which
was
very
clean
and
trim
natives
in
white
suits
acting
as
attendants
showed
us
with
pride
their
charts
there
were
one
or
two
minor
accidents
in
and
some
bad
cases
of
pneumonia
but
they
all
appeared
well
cared
for
and
comfortable
the
lady
who
lent
me
her
horse
has
now
returned
to
kimberley
so
i
have
not
had
so
much
riding
lately
but
the
other
night
we
had
a
glorious
scamper
out
to
alexanderfontein
by
moonlight
about
ten
of
us
went
and
we
had
supper
out
there
we
had
rather
a
mixed
lot
of
horses
and
saddlery
and
on
the
way
back
first
one
saddle
came
to
grief
and
then
another
i
distributed
my
gear
by
degrees
a
girth
to
a
gentleman
who
was
riding
with
only
one
girth
and
it
gave
way
and
i
had
two
a
stirrup
to
a
lady
who
dropped
hers
and
came
off
in
consequence
and
one
of
my
reins
to
another
lady
whose
horse
was
too
excited
by
the
crowd
of
us
and
required
to
be
led
the
others
chaffed
me
and
begged
for
the
bridle
and
then
for
the
saddle
now
i
am
busy
packing
up
for
home
and
trying
to
arrange
things
for
my
brother
who
when
i
go
intends
to
move
into
a
smaller
house
just
opposite
to
the
club
there
is
also
a
good
deal
of
tennis
on
just
now
and
between
whiles
i
am
struggling
to
pay
my
farewell
calls
i
was
rather
surprised
to
find
there
were
about
forty
people
i
ought
to
call
on
and
as
kimberley
does
not
wake
up
from
its
siesta
until
and
it
is
dark
by
now
it
is
difficult
to
get
through
things
and
george
will
have
to
take
some
cards
round
for
me
scot
bay
of
biscay
i
am
sorry
i
neglected
to
post
this
yarn
from
kimberley
but
i
believe
i
will
still
post
it
when
i
land
as
i
may
not
see
you
yet
awhile
and
it
will
bring
the
history
of
my
travels
up
to
date
i
was
more
sorry
to
leave
kimberley
than
i
expected
to
be
but
i
suppose
one
ca
live
in
a
place
for
a
year
without
making
some
friends
whom
you
are
sorry
to
leave
i
journeyed
down
to
the
cape
all
alone
but
some
cape
town
friends
came
to
see
me
off
and
it
was
quite
to
be
on
the
once
more
the
chief
officer
invited
me
to
sit
at
his
table
and
we
have
had
a
delightful
voyage
good
weather
and
pleasant
people
we
had
a
few
hours
ashore
at
madeira
and
i
think
the
flowers
seem
more
beautiful
every
time
i
go
there
some
day
i
should
like
to
stay
some
weeks
in
the
island
we
were
all
shocked
to
hear
of
the
wreck
of
the
off
tripoli
and
the
loss
of
lives
it
does
seem
terrible
we
find
that
if
all
goes
well
we
should
land
on
the
day
of
the
wedding
of
the
duke
of
york
and
princess
may
the
bay
of
biscay
is
behaving
like
a
lamb
this
is
the
fourth
time
i
have
been
through
it
and
only
once
has
it
kicked
up
its
heels
and
been
really
disagreeable
i
am
going
to
spend
a
few
days
in
town
before
i
go
home
so
as
to
be
interviewed
by
two
or
three
matrons
of
the
big
hospitals
i
think
i
know
which
hospital
i
would
like
best
to
get
into
but
whether
i
can
persuade
that
particular
matron
that
she
really
will
have
a
vacancy
in
the
autumn
i
must
spend
a
little
time
at
home
first
and
that
i
really
am
the
most
suitable
candidate
for
that
particular
vacancy
remains
to
be
proved
i
am
rather
thin
in
consequence
of
the
heat
but
i
am
as
brown
as
a
berry
so
i
am
sure
they
ought
to
think
i
look
tough
enough
for
the
work
xii
general
hospital
london
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
but
there
has
not
been
much
of
interest
to
write
about
i
tried
very
hard
to
get
into
some
london
hospital
last
autumn
but
could
not
find
a
vacancy
in
any
really
good
one
so
i
made
up
my
mind
it
was
better
to
wait
for
a
vacancy
here
where
i
had
always
wanted
to
train
than
to
slip
in
anywhere
where
i
did
not
that
the
training
was
good
so
i
have
just
stayed
at
home
and
in
the
summer
played
tennis
and
cricket
and
learnt
to
make
butter
and
jam
and
in
the
winter
had
a
little
hunting
on
rather
a
stupid
horse
that
was
always
doing
something
foolish
and
one
day
distinguished
himself
by
lying
down
at
the
meet
and
helped
to
teach
in
the
where
big
lads
and
men
who
had
been
cutting
turnips
for
the
sheep
all
day
came
in
the
evenings
to
learn
arithmetic
geography
with
much
perseverance
i
went
to
help
at
the
general
hospital
for
a
month
in
the
autumn
as
they
had
a
lot
of
nurses
ill
it
was
rather
funny
as
i
was
sent
to
a
men
ward
beds
as
staff
nurse
and
of
course
i
had
had
to
do
only
with
children
before
so
i
had
to
pretend
to
know
rather
more
than
i
did
i
had
been
there
only
a
few
days
when
the
sister
of
my
ward
went
off
duty
with
influenza
and
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
one
to
come
in
her
place
so
we
had
to
muddle
along
without
a
sister
but
everything
went
on
all
right
and
the
patients
did
well
the
matron
asked
me
to
stay
on
permanently
but
i
thought
a
london
certificate
would
be
more
valuable
afterwards
so
i
only
stayed
until
their
sick
nurses
were
able
to
return
to
duty
i
rather
enjoyed
my
time
there
the
rough
cleaning
work
that
we
had
had
to
do
at
the
children
hospital
was
all
done
by
so
we
were
able
to
give
all
our
attention
to
the
actual
nursing
also
our
food
was
better
and
more
plentiful
but
in
spite
of
these
things
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
deal
of
grumbling
amongst
the
nurses
i
was
not
accustomed
to
this
and
i
was
not
there
long
enough
to
learn
whether
they
really
had
any
good
cause
for
their
complaints
the
work
was
certainly
hard
but
that
was
partly
because
so
many
sisters
and
nurses
were
off
duty
ill
and
when
the
doctors
found
that
i
was
doing
the
sister
work
as
well
as
my
own
they
were
most
considerate
in
trying
to
save
me
trouble
i
had
been
promised
a
vacancy
here
in
the
summer
as
an
ordinary
probationer
for
three
years
training
then
one
day
early
in
february
i
had
a
wire
from
the
matron
asking
me
whether
i
would
like
to
enter
as
a
lady
pupil
if
my
fees
were
arranged
for
and
if
so
i
was
to
go
up
to
see
her
the
next
day
i
could
not
understand
a
bit
what
it
meant
but
thought
i
had
better
investigate
so
up
i
trotted
to
town
and
the
matron
explained
to
me
that
they
have
a
system
here
of
working
in
two
ranks
officers
and
privates
the
officers
are
the
sisters
and
they
are
recruited
from
the
lady
pupils
the
privates
are
the
probationers
who
might
rise
to
be
staff
nurses
but
beyond
that
there
is
no
promotion
from
the
ranks
therefore
if
i
entered
as
a
probationer
as
i
had
arranged
i
could
never
rise
to
be
a
sister
then
she
told
me
that
it
was
probable
there
would
be
two
or
three
vacancies
for
sisters
in
about
a
year
and
a
lady
who
was
interested
in
the
hospital
had
offered
to
pay
the
fees
for
some
lady
pupil
who
would
otherwise
have
entered
as
a
probationer
so
that
she
might
have
the
advantage
of
the
chance
of
promotion
and
the
matron
had
decided
to
give
me
the
offer
partly
on
account
of
my
having
had
previous
training
of
course
there
is
no
of
promotion
as
that
must
depend
on
work
but
there
is
the
chance
of
it
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
good
luck
of
course
i
was
only
too
glad
to
accept
and
they
wanted
me
at
once
so
i
had
to
get
my
kit
ready
in
a
hurry
and
began
work
here
in
february
this
is
a
huge
place
quite
a
little
town
in
itself
and
i
am
very
happy
here
i
think
i
have
been
lucky
in
being
first
sent
to
a
men
medical
ward
of
forty
beds
the
sister
is
a
nurse
and
a
splendid
manager
she
works
hard
herself
and
expects
every
one
else
to
do
the
same
so
the
ward
always
looks
trim
and
the
patients
are
very
comfortable
my
short
experience
at
has
been
very
useful
to
me
and
i
do
feel
so
much
at
sea
in
doing
things
for
the
men
i
find
that
as
lady
pupil
i
am
really
acting
as
sister
assistant
i
go
round
with
sister
with
the
doctors
and
if
she
is
engaged
with
one
doctor
and
another
one
comes
i
have
to
escort
him
round
and
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
know
all
about
the
cases
so
as
to
be
able
to
report
about
them
another
of
my
duties
is
to
give
all
the
medicines
and
that
for
forty
medical
cases
takes
up
a
good
deal
of
time
i
also
have
charge
of
four
beds
and
do
everything
for
the
patients
in
them
there
are
two
staff
nurses
and
two
probationers
also
two
and
i
fill
in
my
spare
time
with
helping
them
in
carrying
round
meals
but
i
do
seem
to
be
expected
to
do
any
of
the
cleaning
work
and
if
i
am
busy
helping
sister
the
routine
work
goes
on
just
the
same
without
my
assistance
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
it
is
a
good
arrangement
as
one
of
the
staff
nurses
in
this
ward
has
been
here
for
years
and
years
and
the
other
one
for
over
three
years
so
of
course
they
know
more
about
the
cases
than
i
do
and
i
should
think
a
brand
new
lady
pupil
who
had
had
no
training
before
might
find
it
rather
difficult
but
i
must
say
the
staffs
have
been
very
nice
to
me
i
did
mean
to
let
it
be
known
that
i
had
been
out
before
but
it
leaked
out
there
are
about
twenty
of
us
lady
pupils
and
we
live
in
the
house
we
have
all
our
meals
in
the
large
nurses
but
at
a
separate
table
except
supper
which
we
have
in
the
the
food
is
ever
so
much
better
than
it
was
at
the
children
hospital
some
of
the
nurses
grumble
at
it
but
i
think
wherever
people
feed
in
a
crowd
there
are
always
some
who
grumble
at
any
rate
it
is
not
to
buy
food
here
at
first
i
had
rather
uninteresting
cases
in
my
beds
but
now
sister
is
giving
me
some
good
ones
i
have
one
jolly
fat
baby
of
two
and
a
half
with
tonsilitis
who
was
sent
to
us
from
a
women
ward
because
they
were
not
sure
that
he
was
not
going
in
for
diphtheria
and
they
had
other
children
in
the
ward
i
had
to
do
a
good
deal
of
treatment
for
him
at
first
and
he
hated
it
but
now
he
has
forgiven
me
and
we
are
excellent
friends
and
all
the
men
are
doing
their
best
to
spoil
him
then
i
have
a
poor
man
with
bright
disease
who
is
very
ill
he
is
a
object
as
he
is
quite
bald
and
he
likes
to
wear
a
red
knitted
cap
in
bed
he
is
often
delirious
now
in
the
evenings
and
then
he
uses
very
bad
language
when
sister
is
out
in
the
evening
i
have
to
read
prayers
in
the
ward
at
first
i
was
very
shy
of
reading
before
all
these
men
especially
when
some
of
them
are
of
quite
a
superior
class
and
when
i
was
in
the
middle
of
prayers
the
other
evening
my
man
chimed
in
with
a
lot
of
bad
language
it
was
really
very
trying
and
i
knew
if
either
of
the
nurses
went
to
remonstrate
with
him
he
would
only
continue
in
a
louder
voice
so
i
had
to
shorten
the
prayers
somewhat
if
he
continues
like
this
i
am
afraid
he
will
have
to
go
to
the
but
up
there
they
have
only
male
attendants
and
we
are
rather
loth
to
send
him
off
as
he
is
really
very
ill
and
needs
a
lot
of
nursing
a
sad
thing
happened
the
other
day
we
had
an
old
man
in
very
ill
with
angina
pectoris
he
had
great
difficulty
in
breathing
and
could
not
lie
down
at
all
i
was
always
trying
to
prop
him
up
and
make
him
comfortable
he
got
very
little
rest
but
he
was
always
so
good
and
grateful
he
was
not
one
of
my
own
cases
but
he
was
on
several
medicines
to
be
given
as
required
so
i
had
to
go
to
him
very
often
for
one
thing
and
another
one
day
i
was
going
round
giving
the
two
medicines
and
when
i
got
to
his
bed
he
was
lying
back
on
his
pillows
apparently
asleep
it
was
so
unusual
for
him
to
look
at
all
comfortable
i
thought
i
would
certainly
not
disturb
him
for
his
medicine
sister
was
talking
to
a
doctor
a
few
yards
away
and
i
was
just
going
to
point
out
to
her
that
the
old
man
was
resting
when
something
made
me
turn
back
and
look
at
him
more
closely
and
i
found
he
was
quite
dead
poor
old
fellow
he
was
indeed
resting
i
just
pulled
a
screen
round
him
and
then
called
sister
and
the
house
surgeon
but
he
was
quite
gone
and
even
the
man
in
the
next
bed
had
not
noticed
any
change
xiii
general
hospital
london
with
much
sorrow
i
left
my
nice
and
interesting
men
medical
ward
and
found
myself
landed
in
a
smaller
surgical
and
accident
ward
for
women
and
children
there
could
hardly
have
been
a
greater
contrast
there
everything
was
done
with
order
and
method
and
well
done
here
every
one
seems
to
rush
about
in
a
breathless
way
and
the
ward
never
looks
tidy
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
bustle
that
goes
on
is
bad
for
the
serious
cases
i
am
responsible
for
eight
cases
instead
of
four
and
at
first
i
thought
i
should
never
get
them
all
washed
in
time
in
the
morning
but
now
i
find
so
many
of
them
can
do
a
good
deal
more
for
themselves
than
the
medical
cases
could
also
the
medicines
in
a
surgical
ward
are
nothing
to
those
in
a
medical
so
i
get
through
all
right
and
keep
up
to
time
three
surgeons
have
beds
in
the
ward
and
that
makes
the
work
a
little
difficult
as
sometimes
they
all
arrive
at
the
same
time
and
sometimes
they
all
want
to
operate
at
the
same
time
this
is
most
awkward
as
we
have
not
got
fittings
for
them
all
and
have
to
run
backwards
and
forwards
for
things
they
seem
to
me
a
most
amiable
set
of
surgeons
i
know
the
surgeons
at
our
children
hospital
would
not
have
put
up
with
being
kept
waiting
as
these
men
do
but
i
do
hate
not
having
everything
they
want
ready
before
they
ask
for
it
however
i
am
beginning
to
feel
my
way
and
i
think
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
get
different
sets
of
things
ready
to
use
in
these
emergencies
it
took
me
some
time
to
find
out
why
the
ward
was
always
in
a
state
of
chaos
and
it
is
only
because
you
are
so
far
away
that
i
can
safely
tell
you
the
reason
i
believe
it
is
simply
and
solely
because
the
sister
though
a
fairly
good
nurse
is
really
no
good
as
a
sister
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
as
she
has
been
very
nice
to
me
and
the
poor
thing
tries
her
best
she
runs
about
and
does
many
things
that
the
junior
probationers
ought
to
do
but
she
has
no
idea
of
looking
after
the
nurses
and
as
the
staff
nurse
is
rather
a
shirker
and
is
very
fond
of
chattering
to
the
dressers
the
probationers
who
are
keen
to
work
are
rather
overworked
and
those
who
are
not
keen
do
work
also
if
there
is
a
rush
of
work
sister
rather
loses
her
head
and
runs
about
in
an
aimless
sort
of
way
and
in
the
theatre
if
anything
goes
wrong
and
they
want
things
in
a
hurry
she
always
seems
to
hand
the
wrong
thing
i
find
it
a
bit
difficult
as
the
doctors
get
in
the
way
of
turning
to
me
if
they
want
things
quickly
as
soon
as
i
found
out
what
was
wrong
with
the
ward
and
that
sister
was
quite
nice
and
meant
well
but
just
had
not
got
it
in
her
to
be
a
good
manager
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
ward
be
a
smart
ward
in
spite
of
obstacles
and
really
it
is
improving
by
degrees
i
have
been
having
a
good
deal
of
correspondence
lately
about
a
small
boy
who
sister
said
would
have
to
go
to
the
workhouse
when
he
leaves
here
and
i
thought
he
was
a
suitable
case
for
barnardo
homes
so
she
said
i
could
try
if
i
could
get
him
in
there
and
i
have
just
succeeded
in
doing
so
his
mother
died
when
he
was
born
and
his
father
appears
to
be
a
thoroughly
bad
lot
generally
in
prison
this
boy
had
lived
with
his
old
grandmother
and
run
wild
a
pretty
little
chap
but
quite
a
heathen
and
fond
of
using
bad
language
in
the
most
innocent
way
he
came
in
here
for
a
small
operation
and
while
he
has
been
here
his
grandmother
died
very
suddenly
the
people
at
barnardo
homes
have
been
very
good
about
it
made
all
inquiries
for
themselves
and
got
the
father
consent
now
they
have
agreed
to
take
him
as
soon
as
he
is
well
he
is
a
plucky
little
chap
and
i
suppose
they
will
probably
ship
him
over
to
canada
one
day
and
that
will
give
him
a
better
start
in
life
than
he
might
get
from
a
workhouse
i
think
we
get
very
good
times
off
duty
here
one
hour
off
one
day
and
three
hours
off
the
next
and
the
sisters
and
lady
pupils
have
a
saturday
to
monday
once
a
month
that
means
from
on
saturday
to
on
monday
when
i
was
moved
to
this
ward
i
just
missed
my
saturday
to
monday
so
to
make
up
for
it
they
gave
me
extra
leave
last
week
from
saturday
afternoon
to
monday
night
and
it
just
happened
to
be
may
week
at
cambridge
so
i
went
down
and
had
such
a
jolly
time
seems
to
be
very
happy
at
clare
and
to
have
very
nice
friends
there
my
sister
was
up
for
all
the
week
and
having
a
time
going
to
all
the
dances
it
was
my
first
visit
to
cambridge
and
there
was
so
much
to
see
it
ought
to
be
easy
to
work
when
you
are
in
such
beautiful
surroundings
on
the
way
back
the
engine
of
my
train
broke
down
and
i
did
not
get
in
till
and
i
had
to
go
and
confess
the
next
morning
in
the
office
that
i
was
late
but
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
been
late
since
i
came
so
i
was
forgiven
we
had
rather
an
exciting
week
a
fortnight
or
so
ago
first
of
all
a
poor
tiny
baby
with
a
very
throat
done
by
its
mother
who
had
afterwards
proceeded
to
cut
her
own
throat
and
killed
herself
they
did
tracheotomy
for
the
baby
but
it
lived
only
a
few
hours
then
came
a
poor
little
girl
of
eight
very
badly
burnt
she
had
had
to
get
up
to
light
the
fire
while
her
mother
lay
in
bed
from
her
looks
i
should
think
the
mother
had
been
drinking
and
the
child
managed
to
set
herself
on
fire
i
think
she
will
pull
round
but
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
she
will
be
able
to
walk
again
she
does
not
have
much
pain
now
and
i
think
she
is
quite
enjoying
herself
here
the
next
case
was
another
cut
throat
a
poor
woman
whose
husband
had
first
cut
her
throat
and
then
his
own
he
is
in
the
male
accident
ward
and
not
very
much
damaged
she
is
a
good
deal
damaged
but
i
think
they
will
both
recover
i
had
arranged
to
go
to
the
academy
with
as
it
was
my
free
afternoon
but
this
poor
woman
came
in
soon
after
dinner
and
i
knew
she
would
have
to
go
up
to
the
theatre
so
i
wired
to
that
i
could
not
meet
her
and
it
was
just
as
well
i
did
as
three
more
accidents
came
in
that
afternoon
and
one
of
these
too
had
to
go
to
the
theatre
a
compound
fracture
of
the
tibia
and
fibula
so
we
had
a
rushing
time
yesterday
was
theatre
day
for
our
ward
and
as
sister
had
had
to
retire
to
bed
with
a
i
had
the
honour
of
taking
our
cases
up
to
the
theatre
i
was
rather
nervous
as
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
been
up
alone
for
our
senior
surgeon
and
he
had
one
bad
case
an
excision
of
knee
but
the
other
three
cases
were
not
very
bad
ones
and
we
got
along
all
right
for
the
last
three
months
we
have
been
having
a
very
interesting
course
of
lectures
on
physiology
and
the
girl
who
shares
my
room
and
i
spend
all
our
spare
minutes
in
reading
up
the
subject
she
is
clever
but
has
not
read
much
physiology
before
so
i
have
been
able
to
help
her
a
bit
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
she
does
better
in
the
exam
than
i
do
we
are
both
of
us
looked
upon
as
quite
juniors
amongst
the
lady
pupils
but
i
do
fancy
the
seniors
are
taking
much
trouble
beyond
just
writing
out
their
notes
of
the
lectures
so
i
hope
we
shall
do
pretty
decently
it
is
not
easy
to
get
much
time
to
read
when
you
have
a
heavy
ward
to
wrestle
with
but
i
am
sure
it
helps
you
in
exams
if
you
can
manage
to
read
rather
more
than
you
are
absolutely
obliged
to
about
what
the
lecturer
is
trying
to
stuff
into
you
in
a
condensed
form
i
have
been
here
six
months
now
and
may
get
sent
off
for
my
holiday
any
day
but
there
has
been
some
delay
on
account
of
sister
not
being
very
well
she
does
not
seem
to
want
me
to
leave
as
i
shall
probably
not
get
sent
back
to
this
ward
afterwards
but
it
has
been
very
hot
of
late
and
i
shall
be
glad
of
a
rest
xiv
general
hospital
london
after
my
last
letter
to
you
i
was
bundled
off
for
my
holiday
i
was
glad
enough
to
get
it
but
i
missed
the
last
two
physiology
lectures
this
was
rather
a
bore
as
the
exam
was
the
day
after
i
got
back
so
i
had
no
chance
of
borrowing
any
one
notes
of
those
lectures
as
i
was
supposed
to
do
however
i
came
out
third
and
my
stable
companion
was
first
amongst
the
lady
pupils
not
so
bad
for
two
juniors
and
we
heard
that
four
or
five
of
the
seniors
had
a
little
interview
with
the
matron
in
her
office
and
were
advised
to
work
rather
harder
before
the
next
exam
now
we
are
having
lectures
on
dispensing
and
they
are
the
most
interesting
lectures
i
have
struck
yet
we
go
down
to
the
dispensary
and
the
makes
us
mess
about
and
make
up
prescriptions
and
make
pills
powders
we
fire
off
questions
at
each
other
at
odd
moments
when
we
meet
and
also
in
bed
at
night
as
to
the
various
doses
of
different
drugs
and
what
they
are
prescribed
for
and
the
antidotes
for
different
poisons
i
was
sent
to
a
very
nice
women
medical
ward
on
my
return
from
my
holiday
and
had
some
interesting
work
there
the
sister
was
very
nice
to
me
she
has
been
here
for
years
and
many
of
the
lady
pupils
like
her
but
she
is
a
nurse
and
she
gave
me
very
good
cases
one
of
my
first
cases
was
a
little
girl
of
ten
with
typhoid
fever
she
was
very
ill
for
some
weeks
and
then
such
a
poor
little
wasted
skeleton
of
a
child
it
was
very
nice
feeding
her
up
when
once
it
was
safe
to
do
so
and
her
great
big
eyes
used
to
follow
me
about
the
ward
wondering
what
the
next
feed
was
going
to
be
sister
said
that
i
could
hardly
have
had
a
more
instructive
case
as
she
had
nearly
all
the
bad
symptoms
a
typhoid
case
can
have
including
a
good
deal
of
h√¶morrhage
i
was
horribly
proud
one
day
when
the
senior
physician
was
going
round
and
lecturing
to
the
students
and
speaking
to
them
of
the
necessity
for
good
nursing
in
typhoid
and
he
made
sister
show
them
the
child
poor
bony
little
back
and
legs
with
not
a
red
mark
on
them
and
he
told
them
it
had
taken
all
her
strength
to
battle
with
the
fever
and
if
she
had
also
had
a
to
sap
her
strength
away
she
could
never
have
pulled
through
we
had
two
diphtheria
tracheotomies
while
i
was
in
that
ward
and
though
they
were
not
my
cases
as
they
both
had
special
nurses
i
was
present
at
the
operations
and
i
learnt
a
good
deal
about
their
treatment
as
sister
used
to
let
me
relieve
their
nurses
for
meals
and
she
taught
me
to
change
and
clean
their
tubes
and
so
on
so
that
when
i
was
put
on
as
a
special
later
on
i
was
not
so
much
afraid
of
accidents
as
i
should
otherwise
have
been
it
must
have
been
a
very
bad
form
of
diphtheria
as
one
of
the
specials
became
infected
and
had
to
go
away
to
the
fever
hospital
and
then
sister
took
it
but
she
was
not
very
ill
with
it
and
she
was
nursed
in
her
own
room
it
has
made
them
talk
about
the
necessity
for
some
isolation
ward
to
put
these
cases
in
of
course
they
are
only
taken
in
here
if
they
are
too
ill
for
it
to
be
safe
to
send
them
on
to
the
fever
hospitals
we
had
a
busy
time
when
sister
was
ill
but
the
staff
nurse
was
very
good
and
to
be
depended
upon
and
things
went
on
all
right
i
must
tell
you
of
a
little
joke
we
had
one
night
in
the
matron
house
where
all
the
lady
pupils
live
late
one
evening
in
september
when
we
were
all
undressed
one
of
them
came
to
my
room
and
said
there
was
a
wretched
cat
on
some
leads
outside
the
bathroom
window
and
it
was
making
such
a
row
as
it
could
not
escape
we
went
to
inspect
and
agreed
that
a
rescue
was
necessary
by
this
time
most
of
the
lady
pupils
had
assembled
and
we
fetched
a
ladder
from
the
boxroom
it
was
too
short
but
we
tied
bath
towels
to
it
and
lowered
it
through
the
window
to
the
leads
then
the
stupid
cat
would
not
come
up
and
only
cried
the
more
so
i
was
shoved
through
the
window
in
my
and
they
held
on
to
me
until
i
got
my
feet
on
the
ladder
and
could
climb
down
to
the
cat
just
then
matron
door
opened
and
they
all
slipped
away
to
their
rooms
i
heard
something
about
too
much
noise
and
lights
out
and
then
she
came
into
the
bathroom
and
shut
down
the
window
it
was
lucky
the
ladder
too
short
or
she
must
have
seen
it
it
was
pretty
dark
and
i
was
sitting
down
consoling
the
cat
and
waiting
till
the
coast
was
clear
when
i
heard
a
smothered
laugh
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
remembered
the
gardens
at
the
back
that
belonged
to
some
of
our
visiting
doctors
i
had
looked
at
their
houses
and
seen
all
the
blinds
down
and
i
had
never
thought
they
might
be
sitting
under
the
trees
at
that
time
of
night
after
that
i
very
carefully
kept
my
face
to
the
wall
and
soon
the
window
was
cautiously
opened
and
with
some
difficulty
the
cat
and
i
were
hauled
in
and
very
quietly
we
pulled
up
the
ladder
then
i
told
them
i
was
certain
we
had
been
watched
and
we
located
the
garden
from
which
the
laugh
had
come
and
next
morning
sure
enough
there
were
two
under
the
trees
so
we
knew
which
doctor
it
was
but
he
never
gave
us
away
and
i
do
know
to
this
day
whether
he
recognised
me
but
i
often
fancied
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
when
we
met
then
the
question
arose
what
to
do
with
the
cat
as
it
appeared
to
be
hungry
and
not
inclined
to
be
quiet
so
eventually
the
most
lady
pupil
was
deputed
to
go
to
the
home
sister
and
tell
her
she
had
caught
this
strange
cat
in
the
bathroom
and
as
it
seemed
starving
might
she
go
down
and
feed
it
and
then
turn
it
out
the
home
sister
was
fond
of
cats
and
her
sympathies
were
aroused
so
she
assisted
in
providing
it
with
supper
and
seeing
it
off
the
premises
in
november
i
was
sent
on
night
duty
the
lady
pupils
are
not
obliged
to
do
night
duty
as
they
are
only
here
for
one
year
but
matron
was
short
of
senior
probationers
and
asked
me
if
i
would
like
it
and
i
thought
i
would
part
of
the
time
i
have
been
an
extra
just
helping
wherever
they
were
busy
and
helping
in
the
theatre
for
any
night
operations
then
i
was
put
on
as
special
with
a
tracheotomy
diphtheria
in
a
men
medical
ward
such
a
nice
boy
called
albert
aged
eight
and
when
he
was
getting
better
another
little
chap
of
three
came
in
so
desperately
bad
that
they
had
to
do
tracheotomy
in
the
receiving
room
and
then
he
was
brought
over
and
put
in
a
cot
by
my
boy
bed
and
i
looked
after
them
both
poor
albert
was
rather
jealous
at
first
and
whenever
i
was
attending
to
the
small
boy
he
began
to
wheeze
too
thinking
i
should
rush
to
his
rescue
but
he
soon
found
that
that
did
not
pay
after
these
boys
had
both
recovered
i
disinfected
and
had
a
night
off
to
air
myself
and
then
matron
let
me
do
the
staff
nurse
nights
off
very
interesting
but
rather
anxious
work
you
go
to
a
ward
which
perhaps
you
have
never
been
inside
before
and
you
do
know
where
anything
is
kept
there
are
from
twenty
to
forty
patients
if
the
latter
there
is
a
probationer
to
help
you
most
of
them
are
sleeping
quietly
the
few
who
are
awake
are
probably
wondering
what
sort
of
a
rise
they
can
take
out
of
the
strange
nurse
some
of
the
sisters
are
very
good
about
giving
one
a
full
written
report
but
other
sisters
are
rather
casual
telling
you
much
of
what
you
may
or
may
not
do
for
number
eight
or
number
eleven
but
seeming
impatient
if
you
try
to
jot
down
notes
the
first
night
off
i
took
was
in
a
men
surgical
ward
where
there
was
a
nice
lad
of
eighteen
who
had
had
his
leg
amputated
that
day
for
a
tubercular
knee
he
was
so
good
and
patient
but
of
course
he
needed
a
good
deal
of
attention
and
i
wished
i
could
stay
with
him
all
the
time
but
there
was
an
old
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
ward
rather
delirious
and
he
would
insist
upon
saying
his
prayers
with
a
loud
voice
and
confessing
his
sins
to
me
calling
me
maria
dear
i
was
thankful
when
the
house
surgeon
came
round
and
ordered
him
a
but
it
took
me
quite
half
an
hour
to
persuade
him
to
drink
it
and
then
it
was
a
long
time
before
it
had
any
effect
in
another
ward
the
sister
told
me
that
the
patients
needed
nothing
to
be
done
for
them
until
i
gave
them
their
breakfast
in
the
morning
but
i
take
great
care
of
her
persian
and
manx
cats
and
not
let
them
escape
from
the
ward
it
was
also
airing
night
so
i
had
plenty
to
do
airing
sheets
and
putting
on
clean
sheets
in
the
morning
but
it
was
not
exciting
i
am
staff
nurse
in
the
men
accident
ward
but
there
is
a
bright
little
pro
on
as
well
and
she
seems
to
be
accustomed
to
do
most
of
the
work
we
have
had
one
case
in
a
with
slight
concussion
of
the
brain
but
i
have
got
him
washed
and
he
is
now
asleep
with
an
on
his
head
there
are
several
bad
cases
in
the
ward
but
they
all
seem
inclined
to
sleep
so
i
am
actually
sitting
down
to
finish
up
this
scribble
to
you
i
like
night
duty
you
seem
to
have
more
time
to
fad
over
the
patients
who
are
really
bad
and
to
do
little
things
for
their
comfort
and
the
convalescent
ones
generally
sleep
and
do
worry
you
but
it
is
hard
work
sometimes
especially
between
and
when
every
one
wakes
up
and
every
one
wants
something
and
there
are
all
the
breakfasts
to
give
round
and
all
the
beds
to
make
and
the
temperatures
to
take
and
the
fomentations
to
change
and
a
hundred
different
things
all
needing
to
be
done
at
once
and
you
rush
around
and
expect
every
minute
the
day
nurses
will
come
in
and
say
what
a
muddle
the
ward
is
in
and
sometimes
when
you
are
beautifully
forward
with
your
work
and
think
sister
will
be
pleased
a
house
surgeon
runs
up
in
his
pyjamas
and
to
say
he
is
sending
in
a
bad
case
and
then
you
have
to
give
all
your
attention
to
that
case
and
ca
do
the
final
clearing
up
for
which
you
thought
there
would
be
heaps
of
time
xv
general
hospital
london
many
and
various
are
the
jobs
i
have
done
since
my
last
letter
and
now
i
must
tell
you
that
i
am
a
sister
or
as
they
say
here
i
have
got
my
blue
but
i
had
better
begin
where
i
left
off
i
was
then
bustling
about
on
night
duty
and
i
spent
a
very
happy
christmas
like
that
of
course
we
should
all
like
to
be
at
home
for
christmas
but
in
hospital
so
much
is
done
to
make
it
bright
and
cheery
for
the
patients
and
so
many
of
them
have
so
little
brightness
in
their
lives
that
it
is
nice
to
see
how
thoroughly
they
enjoy
it
they
all
have
really
nice
presents
there
is
any
amount
of
good
food
provided
plenty
of
entertainments
music
christmas
trees
and
the
men
are
allowed
to
smoke
in
the
wards
the
doctors
and
students
are
really
splendid
in
the
way
they
work
at
decorating
the
wards
and
carrying
the
patients
who
are
well
enough
about
to
other
wards
for
entertainments
the
children
of
the
slums
around
here
will
do
anything
to
get
into
the
hospital
for
christmas
and
the
front
surgery
is
full
of
little
imps
who
have
all
got
a
very
bad
pain
in
january
i
had
to
retire
to
bed
for
a
few
days
with
a
high
temperature
and
a
touch
of
influenza
and
while
i
was
in
bed
the
day
came
for
the
dispensing
so
i
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
and
vowed
i
was
quite
recovered
and
they
let
me
attend
i
made
up
my
prescriptions
a
bottle
of
medicine
and
some
powders
and
then
i
got
under
way
with
the
paper
and
thought
it
was
rather
a
nice
one
but
before
i
reached
the
end
my
head
began
to
swim
and
i
felt
convinced
i
had
mixed
everything
up
and
given
all
the
wrong
doses
and
i
thought
what
an
ass
i
had
been
to
try
it
and
i
was
certain
i
should
come
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
one
of
my
friends
escorted
me
back
to
bed
and
took
my
temperature
and
when
she
found
it
was
she
went
off
and
told
the
matron
so
next
morning
the
doctor
appeared
and
i
was
kept
in
bed
for
a
whole
week
and
then
sent
away
for
a
few
days
change
but
before
i
went
away
matron
came
to
tell
me
that
i
was
first
in
the
dispensing
with
marks
out
of
a
possible
if
i
had
any
more
exams
to
go
in
for
i
think
i
ought
to
arrange
to
have
a
little
influenza
beforehand
as
it
seems
to
stimulate
my
brain
but
thank
goodness
that
is
my
last
you
know
i
have
always
vowed
that
nothing
would
induce
me
to
be
a
matron
well
i
have
been
rather
near
it
i
have
been
acting
as
assistant
matron
for
some
time
first
of
all
the
assistant
matron
was
ill
and
went
away
for
a
bit
and
i
did
her
work
then
when
she
came
back
matron
went
away
for
a
fortnight
and
i
stayed
on
in
the
office
helping
the
assistant
it
was
rather
interesting
learning
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
administrative
department
but
i
am
still
convinced
that
it
is
no
catch
to
be
a
matron
sisters
come
to
complain
of
a
nurse
and
you
have
to
send
for
that
nurse
and
scold
her
for
her
reported
misdeeds
when
perhaps
all
the
time
you
have
rather
a
feeling
that
sister
has
been
unreasonable
in
what
she
has
expected
of
the
girl
then
nurses
have
a
way
of
sometimes
getting
ill
and
it
always
seems
to
be
the
nurse
whose
place
it
is
most
difficult
to
fill
then
matron
goes
out
for
the
afternoon
saying
to
the
assistant
there
are
three
extra
nurses
and
i
have
sent
them
to
wards
and
where
they
are
busy
so
no
one
is
likely
to
ask
you
for
another
extra
and
as
soon
as
she
has
gone
a
house
surgeon
runs
in
to
say
he
has
sent
in
a
very
bad
diphtheria
case
to
ward
for
immediate
tracheotomy
and
can
i
send
specials
over
at
once
i
look
on
the
list
to
see
who
the
three
extras
are
and
find
not
one
of
them
is
suitable
to
take
on
the
case
one
is
going
for
her
holiday
in
a
few
days
and
the
other
two
are
quite
juniors
so
i
rack
my
brain
to
think
which
of
the
ward
nurses
is
most
suitable
and
fix
upon
pro
in
ward
as
she
has
nursed
one
or
two
tracheotomies
so
i
have
to
interview
sister
and
she
is
most
reluctant
to
give
up
her
pro
and
is
quite
certain
matron
would
not
have
taken
her
away
but
i
have
to
be
firm
and
try
to
console
her
by
sending
her
the
best
extra
in
place
of
pro
thereby
incurring
black
looks
from
sister
who
is
quite
sure
her
ward
is
far
heavier
than
sister
some
one
ought
to
be
sent
to
bed
to
be
ready
to
act
as
night
special
but
i
conclude
that
can
wait
till
matron
returns
as
she
may
have
some
nurse
she
has
promised
to
put
on
as
special
that
is
the
sort
of
work
the
assistant
matron
has
to
do
a
good
deal
of
fagging
about
and
acting
as
a
sort
of
buffer
between
the
sisters
and
the
matron
much
writing
of
letters
and
other
work
in
the
office
and
a
good
deal
of
carving
at
meal
times
one
sunday
i
carved
roast
beef
for
seventy
nurses
some
of
them
day
nurses
and
some
of
them
night
i
had
just
come
to
the
end
of
my
time
in
the
office
i
was
still
a
lady
pupil
then
when
an
appeal
came
to
the
matron
to
lend
two
staff
nurses
to
one
of
the
large
london
infirmaries
where
they
had
a
great
many
nurses
ill
i
volunteered
to
go
as
i
thought
it
would
be
a
new
experience
and
then
another
lady
pupil
also
volunteered
it
was
a
pouring
wet
evening
in
march
when
we
set
off
in
a
hansom
cab
the
other
lady
pupils
rather
jeering
at
us
and
saying
that
when
went
to
the
workhouse
they
should
do
the
thing
correctly
in
an
aged
we
had
no
idea
where
the
infirmary
was
but
trusted
to
the
cabby
and
after
a
long
drive
he
turned
into
a
yard
and
drew
up
at
a
door
it
looked
more
like
a
prison
than
an
infirmary
but
i
got
out
in
the
rain
to
explore
and
after
a
little
while
i
managed
to
explain
to
the
old
man
in
charge
that
i
did
not
wish
to
apply
for
admission
to
the
casual
ward
but
to
find
the
infirmary
he
told
me
that
was
more
than
a
mile
farther
on
so
the
weary
horse
plodded
on
once
more
and
eventually
brought
us
to
an
imposing
building
where
in
three
weeks
of
hard
work
we
learnt
many
things
they
were
very
busy
and
very
i
was
sent
to
a
medical
ward
of
beds
but
the
place
was
so
full
that
i
had
patients
the
extra
ones
sleeping
on
mattresses
on
the
floor
for
the
first
week
whenever
a
patient
came
in
i
had
to
consider
which
of
those
in
beds
was
the
most
capable
of
turning
out
and
descending
to
the
floor
to
make
room
for
the
but
after
that
things
quieted
down
and
before
i
left
the
patients
were
reduced
to
the
correct
number
there
was
a
sister
in
charge
of
my
ward
and
of
another
one
just
opposite
of
the
same
size
for
a
few
days
i
worked
with
the
staff
nurse
and
then
she
had
to
leave
and
i
was
left
to
do
the
work
of
the
ward
with
the
help
of
a
probationer
who
came
in
for
an
hour
and
a
half
every
morning
and
who
relieved
me
when
i
went
off
duty
every
other
day
and
on
the
alternate
days
when
the
staff
nurse
from
the
opposite
ward
was
off
duty
i
had
to
patrol
her
ward
at
intervals
and
give
the
probationer
any
help
she
needed
at
first
i
was
appalled
at
the
small
number
of
the
nursing
staff
for
so
many
beds
but
i
soon
found
that
everything
was
done
in
a
way
very
different
from
our
hospital
methods
and
that
if
we
worked
hard
and
fast
it
was
possible
to
do
all
that
was
really
necessary
for
the
patients
but
quite
impossible
to
do
the
little
faddy
things
that
make
so
much
difference
to
their
comfort
for
one
thing
the
convalescent
patients
were
expected
to
do
a
great
deal
of
the
routine
ward
work
and
as
a
rule
the
convalescents
stayed
in
much
longer
than
they
do
in
a
hospital
so
they
were
more
fit
to
assist
but
this
hardly
applied
to
my
short
time
in
the
infirmary
owing
to
the
great
pressure
on
the
beds
also
i
found
that
there
were
only
about
six
or
eight
out
of
the
patients
really
acutely
ill
so
i
was
able
to
give
most
of
my
attention
to
them
three
of
them
were
absolutely
helpless
and
needed
much
care
and
nursing
the
rest
of
them
were
chiefly
old
ladies
who
were
just
not
strong
enough
for
the
workhouse
life
and
so
were
drafted
into
the
infirmary
most
of
them
were
able
to
get
out
of
bed
and
potter
about
the
ward
this
they
loved
to
do
with
very
scanty
clothing
on
rather
to
my
horror
and
i
found
that
when
a
doctor
was
sighted
on
his
way
to
the
ward
it
was
best
to
clap
my
hands
vigorously
when
all
the
old
dames
scuttled
into
bed
like
so
many
rabbits
into
their
holes
poor
old
things
several
of
them
had
evidently
seen
better
days
and
there
were
many
sad
stories
to
be
listened
to
and
they
did
so
much
appreciate
the
little
i
could
do
for
their
comfort
it
was
very
hard
work
as
one
always
seemed
to
be
working
against
time
but
i
quite
enjoyed
my
three
weeks
in
the
infirmary
matron
had
not
told
us
we
were
to
be
paid
for
this
work
so
when
we
each
received
for
the
three
weeks
we
felt
very
rich
we
were
quite
glad
to
return
to
our
good
old
hospital
and
since
then
i
have
been
doing
sister
holiday
work
and
now
i
have
just
been
appointed
sister
in
the
front
surgery
where
all
the
new
cases
and
accidents
come
in
it
is
utterly
different
from
being
in
the
wards
but
i
think
i
shall
find
it
interesting
at
any
rate
for
a
time
i
shall
wait
to
tell
you
about
it
until
i
have
been
here
a
little
longer
and
have
taken
my
bearings
more
correctly
xvi
general
hospital
london
i
think
i
shall
be
rather
glad
when
i
get
a
ward
of
my
own
and
settle
down
but
every
one
seems
to
think
i
am
lucky
in
getting
such
varied
experience
so
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
grateful
and
it
is
not
yet
two
years
since
i
first
entered
here
i
spent
six
months
as
sister
in
the
front
surgery
and
it
was
very
interesting
there
had
never
been
a
sister
in
charge
there
before
but
just
one
old
staff
nurse
who
had
let
the
dressers
do
just
what
they
liked
and
there
was
a
lot
of
waste
and
much
disorder
matron
gave
me
a
very
good
probationer
and
she
was
just
as
keen
on
getting
the
place
nice
and
trim
as
i
was
it
took
us
a
week
or
two
to
get
all
the
drawers
scrubbed
out
and
tidy
and
a
good
many
more
weeks
before
we
got
all
the
splints
sorted
and
padded
the
medical
superintendent
was
pleased
because
i
managed
to
reduce
the
cost
of
dressings
every
week
from
to
before
i
had
been
there
a
month
and
it
was
still
further
reduced
after
a
few
more
weeks
of
course
it
is
difficult
for
young
dressers
who
come
on
for
only
three
months
at
a
time
to
understand
how
much
difference
a
little
extravagance
in
each
dressing
makes
in
the
weekly
bills
and
they
be
expected
to
know
the
relative
value
of
different
kinds
of
wool
unless
it
is
pointed
out
to
them
but
as
a
rule
when
they
do
understand
they
are
quite
willing
to
use
the
cheaper
dressings
for
cases
where
they
do
just
as
well
provided
that
we
keep
a
supply
ready
to
their
hands
i
often
wonder
whether
when
people
go
round
a
hospital
and
see
the
rows
of
white
beds
and
clean
patients
and
everything
neat
and
tidy
they
think
the
patients
arrive
here
looking
like
that
very
often
in
the
wards
when
the
porters
have
carried
up
an
accident
case
on
the
stretcher
i
have
hardly
known
how
to
get
the
man
dirty
clothes
off
and
it
takes
time
before
you
can
get
them
reasonably
clean
but
in
the
wards
you
always
receive
a
note
or
a
message
by
the
porter
from
the
house
surgeon
with
a
rough
diagnosis
of
what
the
case
is
so
that
you
know
which
limb
to
be
especially
careful
in
moving
but
it
is
different
when
you
receive
a
patient
in
the
front
surgery
the
policemen
tramp
in
and
deposit
the
stretcher
on
the
floor
and
there
is
much
mopping
of
their
foreheads
before
they
tell
you
roughly
what
they
know
of
the
accident
and
then
you
have
to
proceed
to
find
out
for
yourself
what
is
the
extent
of
the
injury
and
often
the
patient
is
quite
unconscious
so
he
can
not
help
you
at
all
i
think
at
first
i
had
a
dim
notion
that
every
case
that
was
carried
in
on
a
stretcher
was
sure
to
be
admitted
to
the
wards
but
one
soon
learns
that
a
good
many
of
these
cases
are
more
frightened
than
hurt
and
after
a
little
rest
and
a
thorough
overhaul
by
the
house
surgeon
they
are
able
to
go
home
again
on
the
other
hand
every
now
and
then
a
man
who
has
had
a
very
serious
accident
will
manage
to
walk
up
to
the
hospital
and
he
may
even
sit
down
amongst
the
other
waiting
patients
and
quietly
wait
his
turn
to
be
seen
unless
you
happen
to
be
on
the
and
note
that
he
is
looking
ill
and
get
him
on
to
a
couch
for
immediate
attention
there
is
generally
plenty
doing
in
the
front
surgery
and
whenever
any
of
the
men
have
nothing
better
to
do
they
stroll
in
to
see
what
is
going
on
so
one
hears
all
the
gossip
of
the
place
very
quaint
too
are
the
tales
the
patients
tell
of
their
symptoms
i
am
not
good
at
remembering
these
things
but
there
was
one
old
lady
who
said
the
doctor
told
her
that
she
had
the
brownkitis
and
that
all
her
tubs
tubes
were
full
up
sometimes
we
had
exciting
times
i
remember
one
morning
when
i
came
on
duty
the
night
nurse
reported
that
a
bad
case
of
compound
fracture
of
the
jaw
and
other
injuries
had
come
in
and
been
taken
straight
up
to
the
theatre
and
that
the
house
surgeon
and
all
the
available
dressers
were
busy
with
it
then
she
had
no
sooner
gone
away
than
in
tramped
four
big
policemen
with
a
stretcher
which
they
deposited
on
the
floor
on
uncovering
the
patient
i
found
a
poor
man
on
whose
head
several
heavy
planks
had
fallen
part
of
the
scalp
was
torn
up
and
it
was
bleeding
profusely
i
sent
my
probationer
flying
to
the
theatre
to
ask
for
some
one
to
come
to
help
and
then
i
made
one
policeman
put
pressure
with
his
finger
on
an
artery
on
one
side
of
the
head
and
another
policeman
on
the
other
while
i
collected
some
dressings
forceps
much
to
my
astonishment
first
one
policeman
fainted
and
subsided
on
the
floor
and
then
the
other
one
did
the
same
the
other
two
had
gone
outside
then
the
probationer
returned
to
say
the
man
in
the
theatre
was
bad
and
they
could
not
spare
any
one
but
some
one
would
come
as
soon
as
possible
just
then
the
police
inspector
walked
in
and
his
look
of
astonishment
at
his
two
prostrate
men
was
very
fine
but
he
called
the
other
two
men
to
move
them
and
then
he
gave
me
the
help
i
needed
while
the
probationer
and
i
did
what
we
could
to
stop
the
h√¶morrhage
it
was
pretty
well
subdued
by
the
time
the
house
surgeon
got
down
but
he
saw
at
once
it
was
a
bad
case
and
took
the
man
straight
up
to
the
theatre
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
we
dosed
the
two
policemen
with
mist
ammonia
but
it
was
a
little
while
before
they
were
fit
to
return
to
duty
and
then
we
were
just
thinking
we
would
begin
our
much
delayed
work
when
strangely
enough
two
men
were
carried
in
dead
the
two
stretchers
arriving
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
one
was
a
suicide
from
the
thames
and
the
dressers
tried
artificial
respiration
for
some
time
but
the
poor
chap
was
quite
dead
the
other
was
a
poor
old
gentleman
who
had
apparently
died
of
heart
failure
when
hurrying
to
catch
a
train
we
saw
a
great
many
infectious
diseases
in
the
front
surgery
and
had
to
keep
them
in
an
isolation
room
till
the
fever
ambulance
came
to
fetch
them
i
remember
one
day
when
we
had
samples
of
nearly
all
the
infectious
fevers
to
despatch
first
came
a
case
of
smallpox
then
one
of
scarlet
fever
then
one
of
diphtheria
and
there
were
also
cases
of
measles
and
chickenpox
but
these
had
to
be
sent
back
to
their
homes
there
was
quite
an
outbreak
of
smallpox
just
then
i
think
we
had
twenty
cases
in
the
front
surgery
in
one
week
so
everybody
in
the
hospital
who
had
not
been
recently
vaccinated
had
to
be
done
and
we
were
all
very
sorry
for
ourselves
for
a
time
another
little
episode
in
the
front
surgery
was
when
a
baby
took
us
all
by
surprise
by
being
born
there
we
should
have
sent
it
on
to
the
infirmary
but
the
mother
was
rather
bad
so
we
had
to
take
them
in
one
sunday
evening
i
was
in
chapel
when
i
heard
some
one
come
to
the
door
and
then
the
porter
came
to
fetch
me
and
at
the
door
i
found
one
of
the
dressers
who
told
me
there
was
a
bad
compound
fracture
in
the
surgery
and
the
house
surgeon
would
be
glad
if
i
would
come
as
he
wanted
to
give
an
an√¶sthetic
when
i
got
there
i
found
a
crowd
of
men
all
standing
round
a
poor
little
dog
with
a
badly
crushed
leg
so
we
got
some
suitable
splints
and
they
gave
it
an
an√¶sthetic
and
put
up
the
fracture
then
they
sent
word
to
the
male
accident
ward
to
get
a
fracture
bed
ready
for
a
patient
and
the
porters
were
secured
to
carry
it
along
on
a
big
stretcher
it
was
in
the
hospital
for
some
weeks
and
got
quite
well
again
just
before
christmas
the
matron
was
obliged
to
go
home
for
a
time
so
once
more
i
was
asked
to
go
on
duty
as
assistant
matron
christmas
is
always
a
busy
time
all
over
the
hospital
and
in
the
office
with
the
matron
away
we
had
more
than
enough
to
do
so
many
presents
to
receive
and
acknowledge
and
distribute
and
many
visitors
to
show
round
then
after
christmas
a
good
many
nurses
got
ill
some
with
influenza
and
every
one
seemed
to
be
wanting
special
nurses
at
the
same
time
and
all
were
quite
hurt
that
i
could
not
make
new
nurses
to
order
so
i
was
not
sorry
when
the
sister
of
the
nicest
ward
in
the
hospital
told
me
that
she
had
been
appointed
matron
of
another
hospital
she
had
been
here
for
years
and
as
she
knew
nothing
of
office
work
she
wanted
to
ask
matron
if
she
would
have
her
in
the
office
for
a
few
experience
i
thought
it
would
mean
that
i
should
go
back
to
the
front
surgery
and
i
was
quite
pleased
but
instead
of
that
matron
wrote
to
ask
me
to
take
over
that
sister
ward
for
a
couple
of
months
as
she
had
not
got
a
suitable
sister
ready
to
take
it
permanently
it
is
always
given
to
one
of
the
seniors
here
so
i
was
still
more
pleased
especially
when
i
found
that
the
pay
was
at
the
rate
of
a
year
more
than
for
the
other
wards
this
is
an
awfully
nice
ward
of
beds
in
two
divisions
one
for
men
and
one
for
women
and
children
it
is
chiefly
for
medical
cases
but
there
is
a
small
theatre
attached
and
a
good
many
abdominal
operations
are
done
there
is
also
a
private
ward
to
which
the
surgeons
can
send
any
operation
cases
that
need
especial
attention
and
they
have
special
nurses
in
the
wards
i
have
a
good
staff
as
it
is
always
considered
the
most
acute
ward
in
the
hospital
and
i
can
generally
get
an
extra
nurse
if
i
want
so
i
do
do
much
actual
nursing
myself
but
there
seem
to
be
doctors
constantly
going
round
whom
i
have
to
attend
and
somehow
i
always
seem
to
be
busy
the
longer
i
am
in
hospital
the
more
i
see
how
much
harder
it
is
to
be
responsible
for
other
people
work
than
just
for
your
own
and
i
can
quite
understand
why
so
many
of
the
staff
nurses
much
prefer
to
do
all
the
best
part
of
the
nursing
themselves
than
to
teach
the
probationers
and
let
them
do
it
but
it
is
a
wrong
principle
as
the
probationers
must
be
taught
and
we
must
learn
to
trust
others
even
when
we
know
we
could
do
things
quicker
and
better
ourselves
and
to
increase
the
trust
just
in
proportion
as
we
find
them
worthy
of
it
that
is
where
the
art
of
the
teacher
comes
in
xvii
general
hospital
london
i
think
i
last
wrote
when
i
had
just
taken
charge
of
ward
for
two
months
i
had
a
most
interesting
time
there
and
was
quite
sorry
to
give
it
up
but
it
was
hard
work
unlike
the
other
wards
that
take
in
new
cases
for
a
week
and
then
have
a
rest
is
always
taking
in
as
the
men
in
charge
see
every
new
case
that
comes
up
to
the
hospital
except
accidents
and
they
can
take
them
in
if
they
like
as
long
as
there
are
any
beds
empty
in
the
ward
and
if
they
do
think
it
is
a
particularly
interesting
case
it
is
passed
on
to
the
house
surgeons
or
house
physicians
for
the
other
wards
but
of
course
they
try
their
best
to
get
all
the
most
interesting
cases
for
themselves
consequently
the
sister
is
never
free
to
go
out
with
any
confidence
that
no
new
cases
can
be
landed
in
while
she
is
away
and
when
you
do
go
out
you
generally
find
on
your
return
that
something
has
happened
that
makes
you
wish
you
had
never
gone
still
i
learnt
a
great
deal
in
my
time
in
that
ward
and
i
enjoyed
it
the
physicians
talks
with
the
students
over
these
selected
cases
were
most
instructive
soon
after
i
took
charge
we
had
a
run
of
tracheotomies
the
first
was
a
dear
fat
baby
of
thirteen
months
but
it
had
diphtheria
very
badly
and
was
not
a
hopeful
case
from
the
first
not
many
hours
after
it
was
operated
upon
another
came
in
a
sweet
little
boy
of
three
called
alex
he
was
much
relieved
by
the
operation
and
got
on
so
well
but
the
poor
baby
ran
a
temperature
of
all
through
the
second
day
and
died
late
that
evening
with
a
temperature
of
in
spite
of
all
we
could
do
for
it
i
believe
we
were
much
more
cut
up
about
losing
it
than
the
mother
was
she
did
not
seem
to
mind
a
bit
and
apparently
had
made
all
her
plans
for
the
funeral
beforehand
and
it
was
such
a
pretty
baby
too
the
special
nurses
i
had
for
these
tracheotomies
had
never
nursed
one
before
so
you
can
imagine
i
could
not
leave
them
alone
much
and
was
thankful
i
had
had
a
good
many
to
nurse
when
i
was
a
lady
pupil
we
had
one
very
curious
case
a
young
man
was
brought
in
unconscious
one
afternoon
about
a
little
after
five
he
got
worse
and
his
respiration
suddenly
stopped
the
pulse
went
on
steadily
so
they
did
artificial
respiration
this
went
on
till
and
then
they
decided
to
trephine
thinking
it
must
be
a
cerebral
tumour
pressing
on
the
brain
of
course
no
an√¶sthetic
was
necessary
as
the
poor
man
showed
no
sign
of
life
except
that
the
pulse
was
beating
they
could
not
find
any
tumour
so
he
was
put
back
to
bed
and
the
men
went
on
doing
artificial
respiration
all
through
the
night
in
turns
until
the
pulse
suddenly
stopped
at
sixteen
hours
after
the
respiration
had
ceased
a
very
strange
case
we
often
had
rushing
days
when
it
seemed
impossible
to
make
time
for
meals
and
scarcely
time
to
breathe
i
remember
one
day
especially
when
we
took
in
seven
new
cases
two
of
them
curiously
enough
men
from
quite
different
districts
who
had
both
taken
oxalic
acid
with
a
view
to
suicide
one
was
an
old
man
who
was
very
bad
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
seemed
to
be
getting
better
but
died
suddenly
one
night
from
heart
failure
and
the
other
was
a
poor
young
fellow
of
thirty
who
had
been
waiter
in
one
shop
for
eight
years
and
was
then
turned
off
by
a
new
manager
and
replaced
by
a
german
lad
he
had
a
wretched
wife
who
drank
and
she
took
away
his
clothes
and
then
disappeared
so
we
had
to
rig
him
up
in
a
suit
when
he
went
off
one
of
the
other
patients
gave
me
five
shillings
for
him
and
he
asked
me
to
keep
it
till
he
had
been
before
the
magistrates
as
he
thought
he
would
be
sent
to
prison
but
he
came
back
after
his
appearance
in
the
police
courts
to
tell
me
he
had
been
let
off
with
a
caution
and
he
thought
his
old
master
would
take
him
back
such
a
nice
man
and
most
anxious
to
do
anything
to
help
the
nurses
in
their
work
or
to
wait
on
the
other
patients
and
they
all
liked
him
the
same
day
one
of
the
house
surgeons
was
admitted
with
a
badly
poisoned
arm
and
a
friend
of
one
of
the
students
with
typhoid
fever
he
had
it
very
badly
and
caused
us
much
anxiety
but
pulled
through
all
right
in
the
end
after
this
spell
in
ward
i
expected
to
return
to
my
front
surgery
but
instead
i
was
offered
in
march
and
gladly
accepted
the
post
of
night
sister
and
that
is
what
i
have
been
doing
ever
since
except
for
an
interval
for
my
summer
holiday
and
also
for
a
few
weeks
when
i
took
charge
of
a
large
male
medical
ward
while
the
sister
had
her
holiday
being
night
sister
here
means
plenty
of
running
about
and
plenty
of
responsibility
but
it
also
means
better
pay
than
ward
sister
so
that
suited
me
all
right
they
are
talking
of
having
two
night
sisters
soon
one
medical
and
one
surgical
and
there
would
be
plenty
of
work
for
two
as
we
have
a
good
deal
of
theatre
work
in
the
night
and
sometimes
i
can
not
help
being
worried
when
i
am
kept
long
in
the
theatre
with
urgent
cases
and
i
know
there
are
bad
cases
over
in
the
medical
buildings
sometimes
with
only
rather
junior
nurses
in
charge
of
them
and
i
ca
get
round
to
visit
them
i
have
charge
of
about
six
hundred
beds
and
they
are
divided
into
wards
of
course
nurses
in
each
ward
and
two
nurses
in
the
large
wards
i
have
to
go
all
round
three
times
every
night
and
run
in
much
oftener
to
see
any
bad
cases
and
the
nurses
send
for
me
in
any
difficulty
there
is
a
slate
in
my
office
for
messages
and
when
i
return
after
my
rounds
i
often
find
two
or
three
messages
please
come
at
once
to
please
come
to
urgent
and
so
on
and
i
have
to
fly
to
whichever
i
think
is
likely
to
be
the
most
urgent
the
morning
round
always
takes
the
longest
as
all
the
patients
are
then
awake
and
i
have
to
say
good
morning
to
them
all
and
remember
to
ask
after
their
particular
aches
and
pains
and
it
is
not
very
easy
to
remember
what
is
the
matter
with
them
all
though
i
know
very
well
all
the
details
about
those
who
are
very
ill
and
have
much
done
for
them
in
the
night
there
is
one
place
i
do
enjoy
visiting
and
that
is
the
strong
room
at
the
top
of
the
surgical
buildings
lately
we
seem
to
have
had
so
many
men
who
go
off
their
heads
generally
from
drink
and
if
they
are
left
in
the
wards
they
disturb
the
other
patients
so
much
that
it
is
better
for
them
to
be
moved
and
then
they
have
male
attendants
up
there
but
these
male
attendants
are
not
members
of
our
regular
staff
i
wish
they
were
and
i
never
feel
that
i
quite
know
their
capabilities
or
how
much
i
can
trust
them
and
more
than
once
i
have
found
them
asleep
so
i
have
to
go
up
very
often
when
any
patient
is
bad
there
i
remember
one
night
we
had
a
very
lively
time
of
rushing
about
we
began
with
a
man
who
had
cut
his
throat
not
very
bad
but
he
had
to
go
up
to
the
theatre
then
a
lady
who
had
taken
three
ounces
of
laudanum
and
the
doctors
had
to
keep
her
walking
up
and
down
the
corridor
with
a
weary
porter
on
each
side
of
her
for
six
hours
before
they
thought
it
safe
to
let
her
turn
into
a
bed
then
i
was
called
to
a
poor
man
in
ward
who
got
worse
and
died
rather
suddenly
a
phthisis
case
next
a
tracheotomy
came
in
and
had
to
be
done
at
once
and
while
we
were
all
busy
with
it
a
baby
was
born
in
ward
but
the
day
sister
had
to
be
called
to
attend
to
that
as
i
was
mixed
up
with
the
diphtheria
case
and
could
not
go
near
a
confinement
then
a
fractured
femur
came
in
and
next
an
acute
pneumonia
rather
delirious
in
the
intervals
of
receiving
these
new
cases
and
sorting
them
to
the
different
wards
we
had
to
brew
strong
coffee
and
administer
it
to
the
lady
who
had
taken
poison
and
provide
refreshments
for
the
porters
who
were
minding
her
in
the
early
morning
she
was
allowed
to
go
to
bed
and
to
sleep
she
recovered
very
soon
and
i
do
think
she
will
do
it
again
i
joined
the
royal
national
pension
fund
for
nurses
a
few
months
ago
it
seems
to
be
a
good
thing
and
if
i
can
only
keep
up
the
premiums
i
shall
have
the
noble
pension
of
about
or
so
when
i
am
fifty
it
will
keep
me
in
extras
when
i
retire
to
the
workhouse
as
i
am
certain
no
one
can
go
on
nursing
for
a
great
many
years
at
the
pace
we
have
to
go
in
hospital
just
now
i
am
having
a
rest
and
another
sister
is
rushing
about
on
night
duty
as
i
have
been
warded
for
the
past
fortnight
and
in
a
few
days
i
hope
to
go
home
for
a
change
i
had
a
cold
for
many
weeks
and
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
it
as
i
thought
it
was
only
because
i
was
about
all
night
and
did
not
get
enough
sunshine
to
help
me
to
throw
it
off
but
then
i
got
very
bad
headaches
so
i
had
to
see
a
doctor
and
he
passed
me
on
to
our
nose
specialist
who
has
been
most
awfully
kind
coming
down
every
day
and
sometimes
twice
a
day
to
see
me
it
was
not
really
a
cold
but
some
disease
in
the
antrum
and
he
has
done
two
small
operations
for
me
and
it
has
been
horridly
painful
but
now
it
is
getting
well
rapidly
and
every
one
has
been
most
awfully
good
to
me
and
i
am
beginning
to
feel
less
of
a
limp
rag
than
i
have
done
for
some
time
past
it
was
funny
spending
christmas
as
a
patient
instead
of
running
about
looking
after
the
patients
but
it
was
nearly
my
first
day
up
so
i
was
glad
enough
to
be
lazy
and
i
have
had
many
visitors
so
it
has
not
been
dull
at
all
xviii
general
hospital
london
just
now
i
am
feeling
so
sorrowful
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
this
hospital
my
home
for
the
last
three
and
a
half
years
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
give
my
attention
to
telling
you
how
the
last
few
months
have
been
spent
no
i
have
not
been
turned
out
and
they
have
given
me
a
certificate
and
are
good
enough
to
say
that
they
are
very
sorry
i
am
going
and
perhaps
they
will
have
me
back
again
some
day
i
think
i
was
warded
when
i
wrote
to
you
last
and
after
that
they
sent
me
home
for
a
little
rest
whenever
i
go
home
some
one
in
the
village
gets
ill
or
some
child
gets
scalded
or
some
accident
happens
they
seem
to
think
it
is
necessary
to
keep
my
hand
in
but
during
that
visit
home
my
only
patient
was
poor
jessie
the
family
cat
it
was
sunday
evening
and
we
were
all
sitting
in
the
just
after
prayers
when
poor
jessie
hobbled
in
really
screaming
with
pain
one
leg
had
evidently
been
caught
in
a
trap
and
there
was
a
bad
compound
fracture
which
she
could
not
bear
me
to
handle
so
i
said
we
must
either
have
some
chloroform
or
the
poor
dear
must
be
shot
the
nearest
doctor
and
chloroform
was
three
miles
away
but
volunteered
to
fetch
some
and
went
off
on
his
bicycle
while
i
prepared
some
splints
and
strapping
and
poor
jessie
used
bad
language
under
the
table
i
have
sometimes
had
to
hold
an
obstreperous
child
while
it
has
been
given
chloroform
but
that
is
nothing
to
holding
a
cat
however
at
last
we
got
her
under
and
then
put
the
fracture
in
good
position
and
stitched
up
the
wound
securing
the
leg
very
firmly
on
splints
this
operation
was
watched
with
much
interest
by
all
the
family
and
most
of
the
servants
at
first
the
cat
would
not
come
to
but
we
put
her
in
a
hamper
with
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
when
she
come
to
the
language
she
used
was
something
awful
but
she
soon
settled
down
and
made
a
good
recovery
my
people
were
very
anxious
for
me
to
say
i
could
not
go
back
to
the
hospital
at
the
end
of
my
fortnight
sick
leave
as
the
cat
was
still
in
splints
but
i
had
to
leave
her
to
my
assistant
then
i
returned
to
duty
as
night
sister
again
and
everything
went
on
much
as
usual
generally
rather
more
work
than
i
could
do
well
and
sometimes
rushing
nights
of
accidents
and
emergencies
when
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
fit
in
all
that
had
to
be
done
it
seems
that
every
year
more
operations
are
done
the
cases
are
sent
out
more
quickly
and
so
make
room
for
more
acute
cases
and
so
the
work
grows
but
the
number
of
nurses
does
not
grow
in
the
same
proportion
in
february
there
was
an
urgent
call
for
nurses
to
volunteer
for
plague
duty
in
india
so
i
sent
in
my
name
thought
it
would
be
a
useful
experience
and
i
wasted
much
time
hanging
about
the
india
office
for
interviews
but
eventually
they
were
unkind
enough
to
say
i
was
not
strong
enough
and
refused
to
send
me
would
look
very
strong
after
acting
for
a
year
as
night
sister
for
a
hospital
of
six
hundred
beds
then
the
authorities
made
a
change
and
they
decided
to
increase
the
night
staff
by
the
addition
of
eight
more
nurses
and
one
more
sister
i
was
only
on
for
a
short
time
after
this
came
into
force
just
to
set
things
going
and
then
i
was
appointed
day
sister
of
ward
the
women
surgical
ward
where
i
had
worked
as
a
lady
pupil
and
knew
and
liked
the
surgeons
so
much
since
i
was
lady
pupil
there
and
before
i
was
appointed
sister
of
the
ward
they
had
had
several
changes
of
sisters
and
no
one
who
had
been
there
long
enough
to
take
much
interest
in
it
so
there
was
room
for
improvement
and
the
surgeons
have
been
so
awfully
kind
to
me
that
i
have
had
a
very
nice
time
in
that
ward
my
bedroom
opened
out
of
my
attached
to
my
ward
and
we
had
one
very
exciting
night
there
since
the
night
staff
were
increased
the
nurses
have
had
one
meal
during
the
night
down
in
the
and
there
are
some
probationers
who
relieve
our
staff
nurses
while
they
go
down
to
this
meal
i
was
fast
asleep
one
night
when
a
probationer
rushed
into
my
room
oh
sister
come
quick
it
all
blazing
i
seized
my
and
was
in
the
ward
in
a
few
seconds
thinking
that
she
had
set
the
place
on
fire
with
the
airing
sheets
of
course
my
proper
nurse
was
down
at
her
meal
but
it
was
a
house
just
across
a
narrow
road
that
was
indeed
all
blazing
and
my
ward
was
brilliantly
lit
up
by
the
flames
and
the
poor
patients
were
all
awake
and
some
of
them
quite
terrified
i
turned
on
all
the
lights
so
that
they
should
not
see
the
glare
and
then
we
did
our
best
to
reassure
them
that
there
was
no
danger
two
poor
women
with
fractured
femurs
and
their
legs
slung
up
to
hodgin
splints
had
already
hopped
out
of
their
beds
and
were
literally
tied
by
the
leg
and
they
were
all
begging
for
their
clothes
so
i
let
two
convalescents
go
to
the
clothes
cupboard
and
put
round
the
clothes
to
each
bed
or
for
the
helpless
ones
while
we
got
our
out
in
case
of
need
but
the
firemen
very
soon
got
the
fire
under
two
of
our
students
who
lived
in
the
house
which
was
on
fire
had
to
jump
for
their
lives
and
lost
all
their
belongings
and
one
of
them
broke
his
leg
it
was
really
a
bit
alarming
as
the
ward
got
so
hot
and
smoky
but
the
patients
soon
settled
down
again
and
after
we
had
readjusted
splints
no
one
was
any
the
worse
i
had
to
take
my
month
holiday
in
june
this
year
rather
earlier
than
i
like
as
it
always
seems
more
difficult
to
work
when
you
come
back
to
face
all
the
hot
weather
but
we
ca
all
have
our
holidays
in
the
best
months
a
young
brother
and
a
sister
and
i
agreed
to
spend
a
fortnight
about
our
old
haunts
in
switzerland
and
we
had
such
a
jolly
time
together
of
course
we
went
first
to
paris
and
were
fascinated
with
the
shops
but
tore
ourselves
away
from
them
to
visit
the
venerable
notre
dame
and
then
to
spend
a
little
time
in
the
louvre
but
it
was
only
time
enough
just
to
make
us
determined
to
stay
longer
in
paris
on
our
way
back
in
the
afternoon
we
took
one
of
the
boats
up
the
seine
and
afterwards
went
for
a
walk
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
a
delightful
for
the
parisiennes
good
roads
lovely
trees
and
greenery
and
yet
quite
near
to
all
the
bustle
of
the
town
the
next
day
we
had
a
hot
and
dusty
journey
on
to
geneva
rather
afflicted
by
the
presence
of
some
old
ladies
who
wished
to
keep
all
the
windows
shut
it
is
strange
how
these
petty
discomforts
fix
themselves
in
one
mind
at
geneva
we
had
vast
big
rooms
just
looking
over
the
lake
in
the
hotel
des
bergues
and
we
took
a
rest
there
finding
a
nice
service
in
the
english
church
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
wandering
about
near
the
lake
and
up
the
river
the
next
day
we
felt
more
energetic
and
went
off
for
a
trip
round
the
lake
by
steamer
while
we
went
up
sal√®ve
by
steam
and
electric
tram
a
lazy
way
of
proceeding
but
it
was
rather
an
exciting
journey
crawling
up
the
face
of
the
mountain
and
then
such
a
view
from
the
top
mountains
mountains
everywhere
and
grand
old
mont
blanc
poking
his
head
over
the
top
and
down
below
the
lake
so
still
and
blue
with
green
trees
down
to
its
edge
and
then
the
trees
growing
darker
as
they
grow
higher
up
until
they
stop
and
the
begins
the
next
day
we
moved
on
to
chamonix
the
train
went
only
as
far
as
cluses
and
from
there
we
had
a
drive
of
miles
by
diligence
it
was
a
delightful
drive
on
a
bright
sunny
day
at
every
turn
we
seemed
to
get
fresh
views
of
mont
blanc
and
each
view
seemed
more
beautiful
than
the
last
we
walked
a
good
part
of
the
way
while
the
horses
climbed
the
hills
and
we
found
many
varieties
of
wild
flowers
and
plenty
of
wild
strawberries
chamonix
is
a
charming
place
but
one
wanted
more
time
just
to
loaf
about
and
enjoy
the
views
the
mer
de
glace
is
perhaps
the
most
noted
glacier
in
switzerland
it
is
within
easy
distance
of
chamonix
about
two
hours
walk
and
it
is
a
wonderful
sight
but
somehow
i
describe
it
it
is
all
too
solemn
and
grand
i
always
feel
the
truth
of
what
the
psalmist
says
about
the
men
that
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
these
men
see
the
works
of
the
lord
and
his
wonders
in
the
deep
and
i
think
the
same
applies
to
those
who
climb
into
the
heights
of
the
mountains
but
i
suppose
he
had
not
had
that
opportunity
we
left
chamonix
with
regret
and
walked
from
there
over
the
col
de
balme
to
martigny
i
think
it
was
about
twenty
miles
but
you
can
walk
twice
as
far
in
switzerland
as
you
can
in
england
without
being
tired
the
air
is
so
clear
and
bracing
it
was
a
lovely
tramp
beautiful
flowers
and
ferns
and
rushing
streams
and
waterfalls
the
last
part
of
the
way
was
trying
as
it
was
very
steep
going
down
into
martigny
and
the
path
was
paved
with
little
cobbles
so
that
we
arrived
rather
footsore
from
there
we
trained
to
glion
a
very
favourite
place
with
us
just
perched
above
chillon
with
lovely
views
of
lake
leman
of
chillon
castle
and
the
fine
old
dent
de
midi
at
the
end
of
the
lake
and
it
is
within
easy
walking
distance
of
montreux
there
are
many
nice
walks
and
climbs
about
glion
and
the
flowers
gentians
narcissi
were
perfectly
lovely
then
we
had
to
turn
homewards
and
found
that
we
could
spare
only
one
night
again
in
paris
we
had
meant
to
stay
longer
still
it
gave
us
a
little
more
time
to
examine
the
treasures
of
the
louvre
we
had
a
small
excitement
in
the
afternoon
we
had
been
walking
through
the
flower
market
when
a
shower
of
rain
came
on
we
sheltered
under
one
of
the
stalls
and
while
we
were
there
we
heard
what
we
thought
was
a
sharp
clap
of
thunder
but
it
proved
to
be
a
bomb
exploding
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
but
no
one
was
seriously
hurt
when
we
got
back
to
london
it
was
very
busy
with
preparations
for
the
queen
diamond
jubilee
which
was
duly
celebrated
with
much
rejoicing
all
over
the
country
before
i
returned
to
work
in
town
now
i
had
better
explain
why
i
am
leaving
here
i
have
promised
to
go
as
nurse
to
one
of
the
hotels
up
the
nile
either
to
luxor
or
assouan
where
they
always
have
a
doctor
and
one
nurse
through
the
winter
season
with
a
patient
who
has
spent
the
last
eight
winters
in
egypt
he
is
now
very
ill
and
still
he
wants
to
go
as
he
can
live
so
much
more
comfortably
in
that
climate
his
mother
ca
go
with
him
at
present
and
they
ca
bear
to
let
him
go
alone
so
i
have
promised
to
go
to
see
him
through
the
voyage
we
are
going
by
long
sea
and
to
be
at
hand
in
case
he
should
get
worse
before
his
mother
can
join
him
you
know
i
love
travelling
so
in
a
way
i
am
glad
but
i
do
think
i
am
fitted
for
private
nursing
and
i
am
a
bit
nervous
and
also
it
will
be
anxious
work
if
my
patient
gets
worse
out
there
but
somehow
i
could
not
refuse
it
is
just
horrid
saying
to
every
one
and
everything
here
i
will
write
again
soon
from
the
sunny
south
xix
helouan
egypt
here
we
are
in
lovely
sunshine
the
thermometer
at
in
the
shade
just
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
and
quite
contented
to
rest
a
while
after
a
very
anxious
voyage
before
we
move
on
up
the
nile
we
sailed
from
london
on
october
and
had
a
smooth
trip
down
the
channel
but
i
soon
found
my
patient
was
much
more
of
an
invalid
than
i
had
expected
and
was
afraid
he
would
get
cold
before
we
got
into
a
warmer
climate
the
first
sunday
out
we
ran
into
a
dense
fog
off
cape
finisterre
and
our
morning
service
was
somewhat
disturbed
by
the
constant
hooting
of
the
foghorn
some
of
the
passengers
jumped
up
from
their
knees
at
each
hoot
and
the
captain
cut
the
service
rather
short
and
went
up
on
the
bridge
in
a
couple
of
hours
we
emerged
into
lovely
sunshine
which
soon
dried
the
wet
decks
and
awnings
but
the
next
day
as
we
were
putting
on
full
steam
to
get
into
gibraltar
before
sunset
we
again
ran
into
a
thick
bank
of
fog
and
eventually
had
to
change
our
course
and
put
out
to
sea
until
the
morning
as
they
are
not
allowed
to
run
through
the
straits
after
sunset
the
next
morning
i
was
up
on
deck
before
five
just
as
we
were
running
into
gibraltar
and
to
watch
the
sun
rise
from
behind
the
great
rock
was
a
most
impressive
sight
we
had
a
pleasant
trip
down
the
mediterranean
until
we
entered
the
gulf
of
lyons
and
then
the
wind
got
up
and
there
was
a
nasty
cross
sea
which
made
most
of
us
feel
squeamish
and
not
sorry
when
we
anchored
at
marseilles
early
one
morning
but
there
we
had
to
tranship
to
a
smaller
steamer
and
it
was
raining
and
cold
and
when
we
got
on
board
the
we
found
they
were
still
coaling
and
that
the
lighter
with
all
our
baggage
on
board
was
not
likely
to
come
for
some
time
so
we
could
not
establish
ourselves
in
our
cabins
as
there
seemed
no
comfortable
place
on
the
boat
we
concluded
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
take
a
cab
and
drive
up
to
a
hotel
to
get
warm
then
i
went
out
to
buy
fresh
cream
and
grapes
and
to
find
out
exactly
at
what
time
it
was
necessary
to
be
on
board
i
shall
never
forget
the
storm
of
that
night
after
we
left
marseilles
i
tried
to
make
some
hot
arrowroot
with
much
patience
i
managed
it
over
a
spirit
lamp
which
i
wedged
into
my
washing
basin
with
supports
of
course
the
tin
of
milk
could
not
be
trusted
to
sit
on
the
top
of
the
lamp
so
i
had
to
hold
it
there
and
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
as
i
was
flung
from
side
to
side
in
my
cabin
then
i
found
that
a
linseed
poultice
was
indicated
so
i
again
retired
to
my
cabin
and
wrestled
with
the
spirit
lamp
and
thought
how
little
one
appreciates
the
conveniences
of
a
modern
hospital
until
one
has
to
do
without
them
after
that
the
groans
and
fearsome
noises
from
other
cabins
around
us
were
very
bad
and
i
who
have
always
prided
myself
on
being
a
good
sailor
actually
succumbed
for
an
hour
or
two
but
i
dragged
myself
up
again
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
to
make
another
poultice
and
by
the
sea
began
to
go
down
and
the
sun
came
out
but
it
was
several
days
before
some
of
the
passengers
crawled
up
on
deck
looking
like
limp
rags
and
the
tables
in
the
saloon
were
very
empty
until
just
before
we
reached
alexandria
we
stayed
some
hours
at
malta
and
i
had
an
interesting
drive
round
the
place
from
alexandria
we
had
meant
to
go
straight
on
to
cairo
but
eventually
agreed
it
was
best
to
stay
a
night
at
a
hotel
in
alexandria
to
rest
before
the
dusty
train
journey
we
had
a
wretched
night
and
not
knowing
how
to
find
a
good
doctor
if
i
needed
one
i
felt
very
lonely
in
a
vast
hotel
where
no
one
seemed
to
speak
english
the
next
day
we
managed
to
journey
on
to
cairo
in
the
morning
and
rested
at
shepherd
hotel
until
the
evening
and
then
moved
on
to
this
place
about
half
an
hour
by
rail
from
cairo
and
actually
on
the
borders
of
the
desert
we
have
many
friends
in
cairo
and
there
is
a
good
train
service
so
they
often
come
out
to
spend
the
day
with
us
or
for
the
afternoon
and
then
sometimes
i
go
into
cairo
to
do
necessary
shopping
or
to
pay
some
visits
cairo
is
a
very
gay
place
and
the
people
very
pleasant
and
friendly
one
day
i
went
to
lunch
with
some
friends
and
they
drove
me
to
see
the
citadel
driving
all
through
the
native
quarter
of
the
town
and
then
we
had
tea
with
the
sisters
at
the
military
hospital
a
rambling
big
place
designed
for
a
palace
and
not
for
a
hospital
and
they
seemed
very
full
up
with
enteric
patients
then
we
went
to
see
the
mosque
and
were
seized
by
the
feet
by
several
arabs
who
tied
on
sandals
for
us
before
we
went
inside
and
in
these
we
were
allowed
to
flop
about
the
mosque
is
a
vast
dome
nearly
all
marble
and
alabaster
with
a
lovely
alabaster
fountain
where
the
people
wash
their
feet
before
going
in
to
pray
we
walked
all
round
the
fortifications
and
had
a
splendid
view
of
cairo
and
then
drove
back
to
town
just
in
time
to
see
the
khedive
arrive
from
alexandria
a
stout
young
man
his
native
escort
very
smart
and
riding
such
beautiful
little
horses
another
day
i
was
invited
to
bicycle
out
from
cairo
to
mena
house
so
i
went
into
cairo
by
the
early
morning
train
and
mounted
a
hired
bicycle
for
the
ride
to
mena
house
hotel
the
first
two
miles
seemed
very
perilous
as
our
route
lay
all
through
the
town
and
many
made
the
roads
very
slippery
and
electric
trams
and
steam
trams
rushed
about
in
a
most
confusing
way
and
natives
in
swarms
many
of
them
blind
seemed
to
take
a
pleasure
in
strolling
in
our
track
and
stupid
donkeys
and
camels
with
unwieldy
loads
kept
turning
about
in
unexpected
directions
and
looking
at
us
in
a
reproachful
way
as
much
as
to
say
they
thought
bicycles
out
of
place
in
their
country
the
narrow
bridges
over
the
nile
were
thick
with
traffic
and
i
was
quite
glad
when
we
got
out
to
the
open
country
and
on
to
a
good
road
with
trees
all
along
we
left
our
bicycles
at
the
hotel
and
walked
out
to
the
great
ghizeh
pyramids
really
a
most
marvellous
sight
the
big
pyramid
covers
as
much
ground
as
lincoln
inn
fields
enormous
blocks
of
stone
apparently
just
tumbled
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
and
yet
the
whole
worked
into
such
perfect
shape
to
think
of
how
they
can
have
brought
these
vast
blocks
of
stone
down
without
mechanical
help
from
upper
egypt
for
there
was
no
such
stone
to
be
found
near
there
is
indeed
wonderful
the
temple
also
is
a
thing
to
marvel
at
great
blocks
of
granite
and
alabaster
cut
and
fitted
together
so
perfectly
the
doorway
as
straight
as
possible
and
to
think
that
all
this
work
was
done
from
to
years
ago
and
is
still
as
sound
as
ever
we
had
not
time
to
climb
the
pyramid
but
of
course
we
paid
our
respects
to
the
sphinx
and
wished
we
could
stay
to
see
her
by
moonlight
when
she
is
said
to
be
even
more
impressive
than
in
the
daylight
they
gave
us
a
very
good
lunch
on
the
balcony
of
the
hotel
which
is
said
to
be
the
best
managed
in
egypt
and
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
very
pleasant
place
to
stay
at
nice
airy
rooms
and
a
lovely
marble
at
the
back
as
we
rode
back
there
was
a
good
deal
of
wind
against
us
and
i
was
out
of
practice
and
rather
tired
so
i
found
the
crowded
streets
of
cairo
alarming
and
was
much
relieved
to
give
up
my
bicycle
without
having
run
over
any
one
or
damaged
the
machine
i
think
there
was
more
of
a
crowd
than
usual
as
the
khedive
had
driven
to
the
station
to
meet
the
king
of
siam
and
we
saw
the
whole
procession
pass
on
their
way
back
to
the
palace
the
king
of
siam
was
very
gorgeous
in
a
white
uniform
with
much
gold
lace
and
his
two
sons
were
a
somewhat
curious
contrast
to
the
natives
around
in
their
eton
suits
and
they
are
going
up
the
nile
on
a
private
boat
helouan
is
beginning
to
fill
up
for
the
season
we
were
about
the
first
arrivals
and
we
have
many
visitors
we
are
in
comfortable
lodgings
quite
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
the
servant
who
chiefly
waits
upon
us
is
a
fine
arab
with
a
black
moustache
who
stalks
about
in
a
white
down
to
his
heels
tied
round
with
a
red
sash
he
wears
a
red
fez
cap
with
a
blue
tassel
and
red
sandals
on
his
feet
he
does
most
of
the
housework
for
which
purpose
he
puts
a
housemaid
apron
with
a
bib
over
his
his
name
is
abdul
the
slave
of
god
and
there
is
a
small
arab
boy
called
ishmael
who
runs
messages
and
is
most
interested
in
our
doings
the
mosquitoes
are
pretty
bad
at
night
here
and
we
have
to
sleep
in
nets
last
week
we
had
two
days
with
a
south
wind
blowing
and
then
the
beasts
creeping
crawling
and
flying
a
trial
there
were
great
wasps
quite
three
times
as
large
as
english
ones
and
horrid
little
beasts
that
look
like
bugs
only
they
fly
and
do
bite
settling
on
our
i
am
sure
the
south
wind
must
have
been
blowing
in
the
time
of
the
plagues
of
egypt
i
am
busy
collecting
things
that
we
want
to
take
up
the
nile
for
our
house
as
we
shall
then
be
miles
from
the
nearest
shop
and
it
is
rather
difficult
as
i
do
know
at
all
what
the
house
is
like
there
are
so
many
things
that
i
should
like
to
do
and
see
in
cairo
but
i
have
not
time
as
we
are
leaving
by
the
first
tourist
steamer
that
goes
up
the
nile
and
i
do
like
to
be
out
for
any
length
of
time
but
i
did
manage
a
visit
to
the
great
native
hospital
the
where
i
know
several
of
the
sisters
it
is
a
very
fine
place
with
a
very
theatre
the
nurses
are
all
natives
men
for
the
male
patients
but
they
all
work
under
the
english
sisters
the
sisters
have
a
most
delightful
home
their
dining
and
drawing
rooms
are
very
spacious
apartments
and
they
each
have
a
very
large
room
which
most
of
them
screen
off
into
bed
and
sitting
rooms
there
is
a
special
fund
which
provides
a
carriage
and
pair
for
their
use
and
they
have
a
very
good
tennis
court
in
their
garden
in
which
they
are
at
home
one
day
each
week
and
the
cairo
people
go
to
tea
with
them
and
to
play
tennis
i
have
not
told
you
a
word
about
the
native
bazaars
and
all
the
quaint
sights
of
the
cairo
streets
but
every
one
writes
about
them
and
i
find
them
too
dazzling
to
describe
i
could
sit
for
hours
on
the
balcony
at
shepherd
hotel
just
doing
nothing
but
watch
the
people
take
my
advice
and
come
to
see
cairo
some
day
for
it
is
a
most
fascinating
place
and
i
am
quite
loth
to
leave
it

egypt
once
more
we
have
moved
our
camp
and
though
we
managed
the
move
with
very
little
exertion
for
my
patient
and
are
now
settled
in
very
comfortable
quarters
here
and
he
is
pleased
to
be
amongst
old
friends
and
in
his
old
haunts
and
the
climate
is
perfectly
beautiful
still
it
is
sad
to
see
that
he
is
going
downhill
so
it
has
been
arranged
for
his
mother
and
younger
brother
to
join
us
here
and
we
are
counting
the
days
till
they
arrive
we
came
up
the
nile
on
the
newest
of
cook
tourist
steamers
a
very
comfortable
boat
with
nice
airy
cabins
i
took
all
our
baggage
on
board
in
cairo
but
we
had
agreed
it
was
better
to
avoid
the
noise
and
bustle
of
embarking
in
cairo
and
that
we
should
join
the
boat
when
she
anchored
a
few
miles
away
from
helouan
at
a
place
called
badrachin
two
of
our
doctor
friends
had
meant
to
come
to
see
us
safely
on
board
but
at
the
last
moment
they
were
both
prevented
so
we
started
off
in
an
arabeyeh
escorted
by
a
policeman
mounted
on
a
donkey
who
had
been
sent
to
give
us
any
help
he
could
much
to
my
anxiety
before
we
had
gone
far
the
sun
had
disappeared
and
a
had
got
up
and
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
nile
it
was
quite
cold
and
the
water
was
very
rough
with
white
waves
showing
was
anchored
at
sakkarah
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
but
our
policeman
rode
on
and
signalled
to
them
and
as
soon
as
they
saw
us
they
sent
off
a
boat
to
take
us
across
it
was
rather
a
perilous
trip
as
the
boat
was
a
light
one
and
we
shipped
a
good
deal
of
water
i
was
thankful
when
we
got
safely
on
board
and
found
a
good
doctor
and
other
friends
to
help
us
the
tourists
of
whom
there
were
not
many
as
this
was
the
first
trip
of
the
season
were
all
away
sightseeing
at
the
sakkarah
pyramids
strolling
up
the
river
on
these
steamers
is
a
very
pleasant
way
of
travelling
though
the
banks
of
the
nile
are
flat
and
there
is
a
certain
sameness
about
them
the
lights
are
so
wonderful
that
they
never
the
same
i
used
to
think
that
the
only
thing
that
it
was
really
worth
while
having
to
get
up
early
for
was
a
day
hunting
but
now
i
must
add
the
sight
of
the
sunrise
on
the
nile
and
as
for
the
sunsets
they
are
simply
gorgeous
the
intense
red
gold
and
orange
as
the
sun
sinks
with
the
delicate
blue
above
and
then
you
turn
your
back
on
the
sun
and
face
the
rich
indigo
blue
of
the
afterglow
and
then
in
a
few
minutes
it
is
all
dark
no
twilight
here
and
there
is
a
solemn
hush
over
everything
the
steamers
do
travel
at
night
and
they
stop
at
various
points
where
there
are
interesting
things
to
be
seen
and
then
all
the
tourists
troop
off
and
mount
the
excellent
donkeys
who
seem
to
think
nothing
of
the
heaviest
weights
but
canter
off
to
the
tombs
or
the
temples
as
though
they
quite
enjoyed
it
i
had
a
very
good
ride
on
a
big
donkey
called
mahomet
to
the
tombs
of
beni
hassan
and
another
day
i
went
ashore
and
had
a
good
look
round
assiout
on
the
morning
of
november
i
had
a
long
ride
out
to
see
the
temple
of
dinderah
a
very
beautiful
temple
and
then
the
same
evening
we
reached
luxor
just
at
sunset
and
walked
up
an
avenue
of
to
the
hotel
which
just
at
this
season
is
very
empty
so
we
have
large
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
and
there
is
a
delightful
garden
where
at
present
we
spend
most
of
the
day
we
have
a
little
house
just
across
the
road
facing
the
hotel
and
i
am
very
busy
getting
it
ready
as
i
am
the
only
nurse
here
if
any
visitors
should
come
up
ill
i
should
have
to
look
after
them
but
so
far
people
are
behaving
nicely
we
have
secured
two
good
arab
boys
as
servants
hassan
and
girgus
hassan
can
speak
a
little
english
but
girgus
can
not
and
it
takes
a
long
time
to
get
much
work
out
of
people
when
you
ca
talk
to
them
you
would
be
amused
to
see
me
wrestling
with
arab
carpenters
who
seem
quite
incapable
of
putting
anything
up
straight
and
with
arab
painters
who
never
get
the
same
colour
for
two
days
together
the
chaplain
wife
who
came
up
the
river
with
us
has
gone
on
to
assouan
for
a
few
days
and
as
she
has
left
me
her
donkey
to
use
i
get
a
little
exercise
every
afternoon
the
other
day
i
had
rather
an
amusing
time
i
had
ridden
out
to
karnak
with
miss
to
see
the
temple
it
was
very
dusty
and
we
were
very
hot
and
when
we
got
into
the
shade
of
the
temple
we
saw
a
party
of
people
having
tea
with
two
men
in
very
gorgeous
uniforms
waiting
upon
them
and
a
dignified
dragoman
standing
by
i
recognised
the
dragoman
as
one
of
cook
men
who
had
helped
us
in
cairo
and
he
gave
me
a
sweeping
bow
as
we
passed
i
said
to
miss
as
we
moved
away
i
am
sure
that
nice
dragoman
would
like
to
offer
us
some
tea
and
i
do
want
some
very
badly
and
we
had
not
gone
very
far
when
the
dragoman
came
after
us
with
a
visiting
card
and
sir
compliments
and
would
the
ladies
accept
a
cup
of
tea
so
we
joined
the
party
and
had
a
most
pleasant
tea
the
dragoman
having
evidently
explained
who
we
were
they
had
come
up
on
a
dahabeah
and
were
staying
only
for
one
night
now
but
may
return
later
on
they
told
us
they
thought
they
ride
camels
in
egypt
so
at
keneh
they
all
started
off
on
camels
each
with
a
boy
attendant
on
a
donkey
but
all
except
one
of
the
party
returned
on
the
donkeys
with
the
boys
on
the
camels
the
karnak
temple
is
very
beautiful
i
have
been
to
see
it
several
times
now
and
find
something
new
to
gaze
at
every
time
i
go
once
i
visited
it
by
moonlight
and
then
it
was
most
solemn
there
is
a
very
nice
little
hospital
for
natives
in
luxor
where
they
do
a
good
many
eye
and
other
operations
the
native
doctor
in
charge
has
been
most
kind
in
lending
me
his
horse
a
perfect
little
arab
that
goes
like
the
wind
and
i
have
had
some
delightful
gallops
on
the
desert
all
the
houses
in
luxor
are
built
of
mud
or
mud
bricks
the
bigger
ones
being
over
but
often
you
see
a
little
bit
of
straw
sticking
through
the
just
to
remind
you
that
it
is
a
house
of
straw
we
are
building
a
little
out
at
karnak
and
sometimes
drive
out
there
with
our
lunch
and
spend
the
day
the
air
is
fresher
away
from
the
village
and
the
cultivated
land
and
one
of
the
engineers
who
is
building
the
railway
from
cairo
to
assouan
sometimes
lends
us
his
trolley
on
the
line
and
a
couple
of
arabs
shove
us
with
hassan
in
attendance
several
miles
out
into
the
desert
we
also
do
some
sailing
on
the
nile
when
there
is
any
wind
stayed
here
a
few
days
on
her
way
down
the
river
and
most
of
the
passengers
came
to
look
us
up
one
evening
they
had
a
fancy
dress
ball
on
board
i
went
down
for
a
little
while
and
it
was
such
a
pretty
sight
the
boat
was
moored
close
in
so
that
they
could
dance
on
deck
and
then
stroll
in
the
hotel
grounds
and
it
was
all
lit
up
with
japanese
lanterns
and
looked
so
pretty
with
the
palms
waving
above
there
was
a
gymkhana
one
day
and
it
was
very
good
fun
camel
races
and
buffalo
races
and
all
varieties
of
donkey
races
one
very
amusing
race
was
for
gentlemen
riding
one
donkey
and
driving
another
with
long
reins
in
front
of
him
the
leaders
would
seldom
go
straight
and
they
got
hopelessly
mixed
up
in
the
reins
and
had
to
be
disentangled
several
times
a
favourite
amusement
here
is
to
play
hare
and
hounds
on
donkeys
they
have
quite
a
big
meet
of
hounds
near
the
hotel
and
the
hares
three
of
them
have
a
long
start
to
give
them
time
to
ride
out
to
karnak
and
then
they
have
to
try
to
ride
back
to
the
racecourse
without
being
caught
the
hounds
are
divided
into
three
packs
the
fast
the
medium
and
the
slow
the
master
has
to
be
a
man
of
tact
he
sends
off
with
the
fast
pack
the
keen
young
tourists
many
of
them
americans
the
men
riding
in
their
shirt
sleeves
and
they
gallop
out
to
the
boundary
to
drive
the
hares
in
then
the
medium
pack
trot
out
in
a
way
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
are
probably
very
correct
in
their
costume
for
riding
in
the
row
and
who
would
not
think
of
riding
at
home
without
a
and
lastly
the
slow
pack
consisting
of
people
who
in
some
cases
hardly
know
a
horse
from
a
donkey
and
who
solemnly
jog
down
to
the
racecourse
and
then
loiter
about
to
see
the
fun
when
the
hares
come
in
the
natives
take
a
great
interest
in
this
sport
and
call
it
hunting
the
mahdi
but
their
sympathies
seem
to
be
entirely
with
the
hares
and
they
give
them
every
assistance
by
scouting
about
for
the
hounds
and
secreting
the
hares
and
their
donkeys
in
their
mud
houses
when
there
is
danger
about
and
i
were
the
hares
one
day
and
we
had
a
most
exciting
ride
but
were
caught
at
last
just
as
we
reached
the
racecourse
at
one
point
i
was
hustled
into
a
native
house
just
mud
walls
with
no
proper
roof
and
found
a
buffalo
being
milked
in
one
corner
and
a
baby
lying
on
the
ground
in
another
and
from
there
i
watched
hounds
gallop
past
thinking
they
were
close
on
my
heels
and
when
they
got
out
of
sight
i
doubled
off
in
another
direction
the
donkeys
seem
quite
to
enter
into
the
fun
of
the
thing
and
do
their
best
but
sometimes
they
get
excited
and
bray
inexcusable
behaviour
which
is
most
disconcerting
when
you
are
trying
to
hide
in
a
patch
of
xxi
luxor
upper
egypt
it
was
difficult
for
us
to
realise
the
snow
and
cold
that
you
had
for
christmas
while
we
were
enjoying
perpetual
sunshine
here
my
patient
is
now
established
in
his
little
mud
house
just
across
the
road
from
this
hotel
i
am
thankful
to
say
his
mother
and
brother
have
arrived
so
we
share
the
nursing
between
us
it
has
been
downhill
work
lately
and
now
he
seldom
leaves
his
bedroom
a
large
upper
chamber
with
a
nice
view
over
the
to
the
nile
the
nurse
from
assouan
has
come
down
to
be
with
him
at
night
as
i
have
been
annexed
by
a
poor
lady
in
the
hotel
who
is
desperately
ill
she
came
up
from
cairo
with
a
very
bad
throat
and
now
that
is
better
but
she
is
still
very
ill
and
it
is
not
quite
clear
whether
it
is
typhoid
fever
or
general
py√¶mia
but
i
am
afraid
whatever
it
is
her
strength
can
not
hold
out
much
longer
i
am
with
her
for
all
the
nights
and
part
of
the
days
and
go
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
house
and
get
some
sleep
in
just
when
i
can
there
has
been
much
excitement
here
about
the
rumour
of
war
in
the
soudan
and
now
it
is
more
than
rumour
and
the
troops
are
being
pushed
up
country
as
fast
as
they
can
cook
people
are
in
great
trouble
as
all
their
tourists
going
down
to
cairo
have
had
to
be
turned
off
the
boats
at
naghamadi
the
present
railroad
head
and
they
have
to
go
the
rest
of
the
way
down
by
train
while
the
boats
turn
back
to
take
the
troops
up
to
assouan
some
regiments
are
being
sent
all
the
way
by
rail
in
spite
of
the
line
not
being
yet
finished
the
engineers
are
working
day
and
night
i
met
one
of
them
just
now
who
said
he
was
up
to
his
eyes
in
work
and
that
he
had
twenty
telegrams
in
his
pocket
all
different
orders
and
each
contradicting
the
one
before
so
i
said
i
supposed
he
did
what
he
thought
was
right
and
hoped
for
the
best
they
have
been
busy
here
with
an
old
tub
of
a
steamer
that
has
been
used
for
years
as
a
landing
stage
with
much
tinkering
at
last
they
got
the
engines
to
work
and
now
she
has
gone
wobbling
down
the
nile
to
bring
up
stores
it
was
exciting
when
they
first
lit
up
the
fires
as
i
hear
she
ran
away
and
knocked
pieces
out
of
the
road
on
the
front
the
oxfordshire
and
lincolnshire
regiments
have
gone
past
the
men
packed
like
sardines
in
the
boats
i
badly
want
to
go
up
with
them
but
at
present
they
do
seem
to
be
sending
any
sisters
and
my
work
is
cut
out
for
me
here
just
at
present
all
the
steamers
that
come
up
besides
being
heavily
loaded
are
towing
large
barges
with
either
men
or
stores
in
them
so
there
is
a
good
deal
of
delay
about
our
mails
i
expect
you
hear
more
of
what
is
going
on
at
the
front
than
we
do
as
all
the
wires
are
blocked
with
service
messages
and
we
hear
only
rumours
we
hear
our
troops
have
had
a
bad
smash
up
near
berber
and
that
they
have
lost
a
gunboat
but
whether
there
is
any
truth
in
it
or
not
is
very
doubtful
the
camerons
are
passing
through
here
and
the
natives
are
much
excited
at
the
kilts
i
think
they
rather
imagine
that
england
has
run
out
of
men
and
has
begun
to
send
the
women
somehow
life
seems
very
strange
here
just
now
for
one
thing
there
is
the
rustle
and
bustle
of
war
in
the
air
then
at
the
same
time
in
this
little
place
we
are
already
having
a
stern
fight
against
the
enemy
of
disease
and
all
the
time
there
are
tourists
filling
up
the
hotel
and
making
merry
and
you
hear
them
talk
of
the
luxor
meet
of
the
sporting
club
and
which
donkey
they
will
secure
as
their
mount
as
though
it
was
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
until
last
week
i
still
went
for
a
ride
now
and
then
by
way
of
refreshment
there
is
a
doctor
here
who
rides
an
enormous
white
syrian
horse
and
he
was
most
kind
in
bringing
me
a
beautiful
little
arab
and
taking
me
out
for
a
gallop
when
i
could
get
away
the
arab
was
too
quick
for
the
syrian
and
often
having
let
it
go
i
had
to
wait
for
him
afterwards
one
day
we
were
coming
in
from
the
desert
and
passed
our
chaplain
who
afterwards
amused
my
friends
by
telling
them
that
i
had
passed
him
at
such
a
pace
on
the
arab
that
the
wind
i
made
nearly
blew
him
off
his
donkey
and
then
about
a
mile
behind
something
thundered
past
that
at
first
he
thought
was
a
white
elephant
but
afterwards
concluded
it
was
a
of
a
new
fashion
as
it
left
such
a
track
of
damp
on
the
sand
one
day
the
german
consul
took
me
to
see
his
collection
of
curios
i
believe
he
does
a
good
deal
of
trading
in
them
he
has
got
a
splendid
collection
i
had
to
drink
native
coffee
which
i
ca
abide
but
before
i
left
he
gave
me
a
beautiful
little
antique
a
little
blue
image
that
was
found
in
a
tomb
near
here
and
probably
dates
from
about
so
i
forgave
him
the
coffee
the
other
day
miss
the
housekeeper
at
the
hotel
knocked
up
with
dysentery
and
was
very
seedy
for
a
few
days
before
she
got
well
again
there
was
an
urgent
call
for
more
steamers
for
troops
so
the
steamer
the
that
happened
to
be
moored
here
meaning
to
stay
four
days
while
the
passengers
explored
the
place
suddenly
had
to
turn
all
her
passengers
and
their
baggage
off
into
the
hotels
and
leave
them
there
while
she
did
a
trip
up
to
assouan
and
back
the
hotel
was
simply
packed
for
five
days
and
the
noise
was
very
bad
for
our
sick
ones
poor
miss
was
frantic
at
not
being
able
to
get
about
and
see
about
rooms
for
all
these
people
so
i
had
to
do
what
i
could
to
help
her
but
i
was
frightfully
busy
with
so
many
ill
the
nile
is
getting
very
low
and
smelly
and
we
hear
that
they
have
several
cases
of
dysentery
at
assouan
and
there
is
a
poor
lady
somewhere
up
the
river
on
a
dahabeah
very
ill
with
it
and
there
is
no
nurse
within
reach
free
to
go
to
her
with
all
this
urgent
traffic
on
the
river
it
is
difficult
to
get
things
up
from
cairo
even
urgent
medical
comforts
and
you
can
not
imagine
how
many
things
one
finds
lacking
for
the
sick
ones
from
day
to
day
when
you
are
miles
from
the
nearest
chemist
shop
with
uncertain
communication
by
post
or
telegraph
i
am
always
making
raids
on
the
little
hospital
and
the
doctor
there
is
most
kind
in
helping
us
but
he
is
short
of
some
things
that
he
needs
himself
and
can
not
get
for
one
thing
the
supply
of
chloroform
is
very
nearly
exhausted
we
sent
an
urgent
message
telegraph
not
available
by
the
last
boat
going
up
to
assouan
and
we
hope
the
doctor
there
may
be
able
to
lend
us
some
for
the
present
it
seems
weeks
since
i
have
had
a
night
in
bed
my
poor
lady
is
so
ill
that
i
can
hardly
leave
her
and
i
just
sleep
in
an
in
her
room
when
her
husband
sits
by
her
for
a
time
the
arab
servants
especially
hassan
and
girgus
are
wonderfully
attentive
and
good
in
fact
all
help
us
as
much
as
they
possibly
can
but
with
people
so
desperately
ill
one
does
long
for
london
and
the
best
physicians
and
the
best
nurses
to
help
one
it
is
not
possible
to
do
all
one
would
wish
for
several
patients
at
once
both
night
and
day
and
having
had
so
little
sleep
of
late
i
am
afraid
of
forgetting
things
and
i
have
to
write
all
the
orders
down
and
tick
them
off
as
i
carry
them
out
this
letter
has
been
written
in
scraps
and
i
am
finishing
it
as
i
sit
by
poor
i
must
keep
awake
somehow
till
her
husband
wakes
then
he
will
watch
while
i
have
a
nap
i
fear
it
is
quite
hopeless
and
she
has
been
unconscious
for
some
hours
now
so
i
can
not
leave
the
poor
man
alone
with
her
xxii
paris
you
would
gather
from
my
last
letter
that
we
were
having
a
sad
and
trying
time
at
luxor
and
after
i
posted
to
you
we
had
so
much
more
of
sadness
and
sorrow
that
it
seems
like
a
bad
dream
and
i
ca
write
much
about
it
the
poor
lady
died
of
py√¶mia
and
a
few
days
later
my
patient
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
little
cemetery
out
in
the
desert
that
he
loved
so
well
all
the
winter
the
tourists
had
been
so
fit
and
well
up
the
nile
fortunately
for
me
but
in
january
every
one
seemed
to
get
ill
and
they
had
quite
an
outbreak
of
dysentery
it
began
up
at
assouan
but
two
poor
young
ladies
travelling
with
a
young
brother
became
very
ill
between
assouan
and
luxor
and
were
carried
ashore
and
brought
to
the
hotel
our
night
nurse
went
off
to
nurse
them
and
as
soon
as
i
was
free
i
had
to
go
straight
on
to
help
her
as
they
were
both
desperately
ill
it
was
my
first
experience
of
tropical
dysentery
and
in
some
ways
it
seemed
almost
more
like
cholera
nothing
seemed
to
check
it
a
very
good
physician
came
up
from
cairo
and
stayed
some
days
trying
everything
to
save
them
and
nurse
and
i
were
working
night
and
day
but
it
was
no
use
and
they
both
died
within
hours
of
each
other
then
others
got
bad
and
we
had
to
go
from
room
to
room
doing
what
we
could
for
them
and
wishing
we
either
had
nurses
or
else
had
all
our
patients
in
one
hospital
ward
gradually
the
others
all
began
to
improve
and
we
were
beginning
to
think
of
going
home
when
i
was
telegraphed
for
to
go
up
to
assouan
to
nurse
the
bishop
of
who
was
very
ill
the
nurse
who
was
stationed
up
there
also
being
laid
up
with
dysentery
i
was
not
pleased
at
having
to
go
as
we
were
just
packing
up
to
travel
home
clearing
up
the
house
and
i
was
feeling
very
done
up
but
i
could
not
well
refuse
as
there
was
no
other
nurse
within
reach
so
i
went
off
by
the
post
boat
and
spent
most
of
the
two
days
on
board
in
sleeping
as
i
did
not
know
how
much
work
might
be
waiting
for
me
and
i
had
a
good
deal
to
make
up
in
the
way
of
sleep
i
find
from
my
diary
that
between
the
of
january
and
the
of
february
i
had
never
had
a
complete
night
in
bed
and
sometimes
even
the
odd
hours
of
sleep
were
very
few
and
far
between
but
when
i
got
to
assouan
i
found
that
every
one
was
on
the
mend
and
they
hardly
needed
a
nurse
so
i
stayed
only
a
few
days
to
help
and
managed
to
explore
phil√¶
one
afternoon
and
then
i
left
again
by
post
boat
for
cairo
the
doctor
putting
a
lady
who
had
been
very
ill
with
dysentery
under
my
care
and
giving
me
a
little
stock
of
medicines
to
use
at
my
discretion
as
the
post
boats
unlike
the
tourist
boats
carry
no
doctor
we
stayed
an
hour
or
two
at
luxor
so
that
i
managed
to
collect
my
baggage
and
said
many
all
the
inhabitants
including
the
servant
boys
and
the
donkey
boys
seemed
to
be
there
to
see
us
off
and
they
had
all
been
so
very
kind
to
me
through
a
very
trying
winter
that
i
felt
as
though
i
had
known
them
for
years
there
were
pleasant
people
on
board
the
boat
and
the
gentleman
sitting
next
to
me
at
table
knew
kimberley
well
and
knew
my
brother
out
there
so
we
had
much
talk
about
south
africa
the
boat
was
simply
packed
and
as
it
was
getting
very
hot
every
one
wanted
to
rush
down
the
river
at
the
same
time
there
were
supposed
to
be
berths
and
the
manager
told
me
that
there
were
passengers
on
board
men
sleeping
in
all
the
bathrooms
and
the
saloon
full
at
night
i
had
a
sort
of
little
to
myself
in
the
not
a
bad
little
hole
when
i
got
there
but
to
get
to
it
each
time
i
had
to
cross
the
lower
deck
where
all
the
native
passengers
live
and
sleep
my
sick
lady
improved
as
we
got
down
the
river
and
it
was
very
lucky
she
did
as
before
we
reached
cairo
i
became
seedy
with
dysentery
myself
and
had
to
consume
some
of
the
drugs
the
assouan
doctor
had
given
me
in
case
of
need
the
last
day
on
board
was
exciting
as
the
nile
was
so
low
we
kept
banging
on
to
sandbanks
and
all
the
glasses
were
broken
and
as
many
of
the
passengers
had
only
just
allowed
time
to
catch
their
ship
at
alexandria
there
was
much
anxiety
lest
we
should
stick
fast
i
saw
my
lady
patient
safely
into
good
hands
at
mena
house
and
then
just
caught
my
friends
in
cairo
they
had
gone
down
from
luxor
when
i
went
up
to
assouan
and
after
getting
some
advice
from
one
of
our
good
medical
friends
there
we
went
straight
on
to
join
our
ship
at
alexandria
when
i
got
on
board
i
felt
so
absolutely
done
up
i
had
to
turn
straight
into
my
berth
and
the
ship
doctor
took
me
in
charge
i
believe
he
rather
thought
i
was
in
for
typhoid
and
wanted
us
to
go
on
to
venice
with
them
so
that
he
could
look
after
me
for
a
bit
longer
as
they
stay
some
days
at
venice
but
three
days
rest
at
sea
and
some
medicines
pulled
me
together
a
bit
and
i
did
not
want
to
upset
plans
we
landed
at
brindisi
and
spent
an
uncomfortable
night
in
a
hotel
because
we
found
the
sheets
were
very
wet
and
felt
obliged
to
sleep
in
blankets
a
thing
i
never
enjoy
from
there
we
had
a
train
journey
of
eleven
hours
to
naples
and
we
did
an
idiotic
thing
for
which
we
have
not
forgiven
ourselves
yet
we
got
up
at
thinking
our
train
started
at
and
when
we
got
to
the
station
found
that
our
tickets
were
made
out
to
travel
by
another
route
and
the
train
did
not
leave
till
naples
was
perfectly
beautiful
from
our
windows
such
a
glorious
view
of
the
bay
and
of
vesuvius
in
the
distance
we
could
not
go
up
vesuvius
as
he
was
rather
active
just
then
and
some
people
who
went
up
the
day
we
arrived
nearly
got
burnt
with
some
hot
lava
we
went
one
day
by
steamer
to
sorrento
a
place
i
should
like
to
stay
at
some
day
and
then
over
to
capri
and
we
explored
the
wonderful
blue
grotto
there
capri
is
a
sweet
place
with
such
lovely
flowers
and
ferns
another
day
we
spent
at
pompeii
and
wished
we
could
spare
more
time
for
exploring
the
museum
in
naples
where
most
of
the
best
things
from
pompeii
are
now
shown
and
then
a
drive
we
took
along
the
bay
to
posilipo
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
drives
i
have
ever
enjoyed
from
naples
we
moved
on
to
rome
it
is
quite
hopeless
to
try
to
see
rome
in
anything
under
a
month
at
least
so
we
did
not
try
the
place
seemed
to
be
full
of
our
egyptian
friends
and
we
met
them
at
every
turn
so
we
had
a
very
pleasant
time
there
and
of
course
we
did
see
of
the
sights
we
spent
some
time
at
peter
and
several
more
of
the
wonderful
churches
and
we
explored
the
colosseum
and
the
forum
and
the
therm√¶
caracalla
and
we
went
down
some
catacombs
and
were
very
glad
to
get
safely
up
again
in
fact
we
saw
just
enough
to
make
us
wish
to
return
some
day
with
time
and
money
to
enjoy
it
all
more
fully
we
then
moved
on
to
florence
and
had
a
few
most
enjoyable
days
there
the
picture
galleries
were
most
fascinating
so
many
pictures
that
one
has
known
and
loved
all
one
life
from
photographs
and
will
now
love
all
the
more
for
having
seen
the
originals
the
town
is
very
interesting
and
the
surrounding
country
is
lovely
our
last
day
in
florence
was
wet
this
was
disappointing
but
as
it
was
the
first
rain
i
had
seen
since
last
september
i
could
hardly
complain
we
spent
a
night
in
the
train
and
then
stayed
a
few
hours
in
milan
just
to
see
the
very
beautiful
cathedral
and
then
got
on
board
a
corridor
train
to
cross
the
gothard
near
milan
the
fields
were
thick
with
primroses
and
anemones
and
it
was
quite
hot
but
we
soon
got
up
amongst
the
snow
and
then
the
scenery
was
simply
grand
we
stayed
a
few
days
with
some
swiss
friends
in
z√ºrich
they
have
a
delightful
house
looking
over
the
lake
and
the
snow
mountains
in
the
distance
are
such
a
restful
sight
one
day
we
went
out
by
train
and
then
did
a
little
climbing
and
got
up
amongst
the
snow
it
was
so
funny
after
all
the
scorching
we
have
had
just
lately
from
there
we
travelled
by
night
on
to
paris
and
now
we
have
come
to
the
end
of
our
saunter
across
the
continent
and
i
am
sure
it
has
done
us
all
good
and
has
been
most
refreshing
i
have
just
been
out
to
get
my
hair
shampooed
and
i
think
i
have
now
got
rid
of
the
last
remains
of
egyptian
dust
we
make
tracks
for
england
and
then
i
do
quite
know
what
is
to
be
my
next
move
but
more
work
i
hope
of
some
kind
or
another
xxiii
general
hospital
london
i
do
think
i
have
written
to
you
since
i
slipped
back
into
my
work
here
we
got
back
from
egypt
in
april
and
i
spent
a
little
time
at
home
and
paid
a
few
visits
and
then
the
matron
asked
me
if
i
would
return
to
take
charge
of
one
of
the
women
surgical
wards
for
four
months
while
the
sister
was
away
on
sick
leave
so
back
i
came
at
the
beginning
of
july
and
it
seems
as
though
i
am
likely
to
remain
i
had
such
a
nice
welcome
back
from
every
one
from
the
surgeons
down
to
the
porters
that
i
soon
felt
quite
at
home
again
at
first
it
was
rather
strange
as
they
have
changed
the
off
duty
times
and
all
the
nurses
get
more
time
off
so
that
means
you
have
more
nurses
and
when
they
were
all
on
together
it
seemed
such
a
crowd
to
me
in
that
ward
for
beds
and
four
cots
i
had
a
staff
nurse
a
senior
probationer
and
three
other
probationers
and
two
lady
pupils
seven
besides
myself
on
day
duty
and
a
staff
nurse
and
a
probationer
on
night
duty
but
it
is
seldom
they
are
all
on
at
the
same
time
and
i
have
to
run
around
and
see
that
those
who
are
on
attend
to
the
work
of
those
who
are
off
and
that
things
are
not
neglected
because
it
is
not
my
work
it
is
nice
for
the
nurses
not
to
be
so
rushed
as
we
used
to
be
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
it
is
such
good
training
i
do
think
they
feel
quite
so
personally
responsible
for
their
patients
welfare
as
they
did
when
there
was
no
one
equally
responsible
with
them
it
is
rather
difficult
to
explain
exactly
what
i
mean
for
one
thing
the
staff
nurses
now
have
two
days
off
together
each
month
so
we
have
a
senior
probationer
who
takes
over
their
work
for
those
two
days
and
i
find
they
get
much
more
out
of
touch
with
what
has
been
ordered
for
the
patients
than
they
did
when
they
were
away
only
for
one
day
but
i
am
getting
used
to
it
now
the
ward
i
had
when
i
first
came
back
was
rather
dingy
and
i
regretted
all
the
nice
and
vases
i
had
left
behind
in
the
ward
i
had
when
i
was
last
here
to
say
nothing
of
my
nice
stock
of
clothes
i
had
heaps
of
white
sailor
blouse
tops
for
the
small
boys
and
muslin
pinafores
for
the
little
girls
with
pale
blue
frocks
to
wear
under
the
pinafores
on
high
days
and
holidays
but
i
did
not
spend
much
on
vanities
in
that
ward
as
it
was
not
worth
while
for
a
short
time
and
the
more
fancy
things
you
have
the
more
it
costs
you
in
washing
as
the
hospital
wo
pay
for
vanities
though
it
does
make
a
difference
to
the
look
of
your
ward
when
visitors
go
round
and
the
mothers
just
love
to
see
their
poor
little
kiddies
dressed
up
like
a
real
little
lady
instead
of
in
flannelette
i
liked
both
the
night
and
the
day
staff
nurse
in
that
ward
and
they
were
very
nice
to
me
sometimes
staff
nurses
are
nice
to
a
sister
doing
temporary
work
as
they
often
think
they
might
have
been
allowed
to
do
the
sister
work
themselves
the
ward
had
been
noted
for
never
being
without
squalling
babies
and
i
was
rather
amused
to
hear
from
another
old
nurse
of
mine
that
these
staff
nurses
had
learnt
that
i
was
very
particular
about
tidiness
and
very
anxious
that
the
babies
should
have
no
reasonable
excuse
for
squalling
so
they
were
determined
to
try
to
please
me
in
those
respects
one
day
i
came
down
from
the
theatre
after
being
up
for
several
operations
just
at
and
i
thought
the
ward
looked
rather
untidy
but
i
wanted
my
tea
so
badly
and
the
had
it
all
ready
for
me
so
after
taking
a
look
at
the
operation
cases
i
rather
unwisely
concluded
i
would
drink
it
before
going
round
to
tidy
up
and
of
course
before
i
had
finished
tea
the
matron
came
in
and
i
had
to
escort
her
round
inwardly
fuming
at
some
crumbs
by
a
child
cot
and
some
of
the
trays
brought
down
from
the
theatre
and
not
put
tidily
away
but
matron
was
very
amiable
and
when
we
got
to
the
door
she
said
sister
i
never
remember
seeing
the
ward
so
trim
and
neat
after
a
theatre
afternoon
and
not
a
single
baby
squalling
so
of
course
i
told
the
staff
nurse
and
she
was
mightily
pleased
we
had
had
a
curious
case
in
the
theatre
that
afternoon
a
poor
little
scrap
of
a
baby
one
day
old
born
with
an
imperforate
anus
as
soon
as
they
began
to
give
it
an
an√¶sthetic
it
stopped
breathing
and
after
trying
to
revive
it
for
some
time
the
surgeon
put
on
his
coat
and
went
away
but
we
continued
doing
artificial
respiration
and
eventually
the
child
came
round
so
another
surgeon
who
was
still
in
the
hospital
came
in
and
he
advised
the
house
surgeon
to
do
colostomy
which
he
did
very
rapidly
and
the
poor
little
mite
was
relieved
but
it
only
lived
a
day
we
had
a
house
surgeon
on
just
then
and
he
looked
after
his
dressers
well
you
have
no
idea
how
slack
and
lazy
the
dressers
sometimes
get
if
the
house
surgeon
is
not
keen
and
it
makes
a
vast
difference
to
the
patients
comfort
it
happened
to
be
our
take
in
week
when
bank
holiday
came
and
we
had
a
very
lively
week
altogether
we
took
in
sixteen
cases
but
a
few
of
them
were
injuries
to
arms
or
fingers
so
they
were
able
to
go
out
again
after
a
night
or
two
thus
leaving
beds
free
for
others
on
bank
holiday
itself
things
were
pretty
quiet
until
the
evening
and
then
we
had
four
accidents
in
two
hours
an
old
lady
of
with
a
fractured
femur
a
baby
with
a
scalp
wound
fell
from
its
chair
on
to
the
fender
a
little
child
badly
scalded
and
a
very
big
and
fat
woman
with
a
fractured
tibia
and
fibula
who
i
was
horrified
to
find
was
expecting
a
baby
to
arrive
very
shortly
and
as
none
of
my
nurses
had
had
any
experience
of
such
things
nor
had
the
present
night
sister
i
felt
obliged
to
keep
within
hail
both
night
and
day
but
one
sunday
i
thought
it
seemed
safe
to
go
out
to
church
and
another
sister
promised
to
attend
if
required
and
sure
enough
she
required
but
all
went
well
and
the
mother
made
a
good
recovery
and
i
think
was
rather
pleased
to
go
out
with
a
fine
healthy
baby
having
been
saved
all
the
expense
of
her
confinement
when
the
sister
of
that
ward
returned
there
was
a
small
men
accident
ward
vacant
so
i
was
offered
that
until
a
larger
ward
should
be
free
i
was
sorry
to
leave
the
children
but
the
new
ward
was
under
the
surgeons
for
whom
i
had
worked
before
i
went
to
egypt
and
i
was
glad
to
be
on
for
them
again
it
was
november
when
i
moved
my
camp
and
i
seemed
to
have
hardly
had
time
to
turn
round
before
christmas
was
upon
us
and
a
very
bright
and
cheery
christmas
we
had
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
were
taking
in
and
the
cases
simply
streamed
in
altogether
we
admitted
cases
during
the
week
for
our
twenty
beds
of
course
some
kept
going
out
but
we
had
to
send
our
most
movable
patients
to
sleep
in
other
wards
so
as
to
keep
a
bed
always
ready
for
the
next
accident
amongst
the
cases
we
had
two
poor
fellows
who
had
cut
their
throats
one
a
lad
of
who
had
had
influenza
and
the
other
a
man
of
who
had
been
jilted
by
a
girl
they
both
had
tracheotomy
done
and
both
did
pretty
well
at
first
but
i
do
think
the
younger
man
wanted
to
get
better
and
eventually
he
got
pneumonia
and
died
the
other
man
got
all
right
again
all
through
christmas
week
they
both
had
policemen
sitting
by
them
in
case
they
should
attempt
suicide
again
and
these
policemen
were
most
useful
in
helping
with
the
decorations
at
the
same
time
we
had
a
big
drayman
in
who
had
fallen
off
his
dray
and
got
slight
concussion
of
the
brain
he
did
not
get
quite
sensible
for
some
time
though
he
was
never
very
ill
and
he
was
always
trying
to
get
out
of
bed
and
whenever
any
one
got
up
on
the
ladders
to
do
a
little
decorating
there
would
be
a
call
that
no
was
getting
out
and
we
all
had
to
run
to
put
him
back
and
tuck
him
up
again
these
various
interruptions
made
our
decorations
a
very
slow
process
but
eventually
the
ward
looked
very
nice
and
i
think
the
patients
had
a
very
happy
christmas
even
the
two
poor
men
seemed
quite
pleased
and
interested
in
their
presents
though
they
were
neither
of
them
able
to
enjoy
the
privilege
of
a
smoke
which
all
the
other
men
including
the
policemen
so
much
enjoyed
on
christmas
day
one
man
who
came
in
with
a
damaged
knee
told
me
that
he
was
a
rival
strong
man
to
sandow
and
as
he
was
verging
on
delirium
tremens
for
some
days
we
felt
a
little
anxious
until
he
calmed
down
but
he
proved
to
be
quite
a
nice
patient
xxiv
general
hospital
london
i
seem
to
have
been
wasting
a
lot
of
time
this
year
in
being
seedy
in
one
way
or
another
so
i
do
think
that
i
have
much
of
interest
to
write
to
you
about
and
now
that
the
war
in
south
africa
is
making
us
all
excited
as
every
one
feels
as
if
he
ought
to
lend
a
hand
it
is
difficult
to
think
of
the
trifles
that
have
been
filling
up
our
lives
for
the
last
few
months
after
i
wrote
to
you
last
we
had
in
yet
another
who
proved
to
be
a
lunatic
and
he
gave
us
a
very
lively
time
before
we
got
him
well
enough
to
despatch
to
an
asylum
one
day
he
jumped
out
of
bed
in
a
great
hurry
as
he
was
very
fond
of
doing
if
the
policeman
in
charge
took
his
eye
off
him
for
a
minute
so
the
man
in
the
next
bed
called
out
halloa
mate
where
are
you
off
to
to
which
he
replied
i
got
a
pass
for
heaven
so
i
off
and
it
took
some
persuasion
before
he
would
believe
that
the
train
for
that
destination
was
not
due
yet
another
night
he
proposed
to
the
night
nurse
as
he
thought
they
might
get
on
well
in
the
fried
fish
line
together
it
is
strange
how
nervous
men
are
with
any
one
a
little
bit
off
even
some
of
these
big
policemen
always
call
out
for
us
to
come
if
a
man
gets
restless
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
of
them
and
can
generally
get
them
to
do
what
i
want
with
a
little
chaff
but
i
am
heartily
tired
of
having
in
the
ward
i
seem
to
have
had
so
many
of
them
at
one
time
or
another
and
they
are
a
great
anxiety
we
had
so
many
accidents
in
from
the
railway
station
near
by
last
winter
that
the
superintendent
very
kindly
told
me
as
one
of
the
accident
sisters
i
might
have
a
free
pass
any
that
i
liked
to
apply
for
it
to
any
station
on
their
line
so
i
had
a
very
good
time
going
to
visit
friends
and
relations
at
the
seaside
when
i
was
able
to
get
away
from
saturday
to
monday
and
they
were
passes
too
so
that
one
could
go
by
the
fastest
trains
one
evening
in
may
i
found
that
a
lad
who
had
been
brought
in
with
a
broken
leg
was
peeling
nicely
all
over
and
we
extracted
a
history
that
have
meant
a
slight
attack
of
scarlet
fever
but
it
was
so
indefinite
that
the
house
surgeon
did
not
believe
it
and
did
not
have
him
moved
at
once
and
two
days
later
another
small
boy
developed
scarlet
fever
and
then
one
of
the
nurses
and
they
began
to
talk
about
closing
the
ward
then
one
day
i
had
a
raging
headache
but
did
not
think
anything
of
it
but
when
i
went
to
bed
much
to
my
disgust
i
found
i
had
a
brilliant
rash
and
the
next
day
the
doctor
came
along
and
agreed
in
my
diagnosis
of
scarlet
fever
and
offered
to
isolate
me
there
or
send
me
to
the
london
fever
hospital
paying
but
i
thought
i
would
just
as
soon
sample
an
ordinary
a
b
hospital
so
i
took
my
departure
in
state
in
the
fever
ambulance
with
a
crowd
of
friends
to
see
me
off
from
a
safe
distance
at
the
door
they
made
me
very
comfortable
at
the
fever
hospital
but
i
felt
rather
a
fraud
as
i
had
the
fever
so
very
mildly
that
i
was
never
ill
at
all
no
sore
throat
and
no
temperature
after
the
first
two
days
in
fact
i
think
they
doubted
whether
i
had
ever
had
it
at
all
and
it
was
very
slow
work
waiting
to
peel
having
at
last
accomplished
this
process
i
went
back
to
the
hospital
to
clear
up
my
rooms
as
a
larger
ward
was
going
to
be
vacant
soon
and
matron
wanted
me
to
have
it
after
i
had
taken
a
holiday
so
i
had
a
good
time
at
home
in
the
best
of
the
summer
weather
and
paid
a
few
visits
going
down
to
the
isle
of
wight
and
having
some
splendid
bathing
and
boating
there
but
it
is
strange
how
it
takes
it
out
of
one
having
scarlet
fever
even
when
you
have
it
as
ridiculously
mildly
as
i
did
and
i
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
with
swollen
feet
and
other
forms
of
feebleness
in
july
i
attended
a
very
pleasant
function
at
marlborough
house
when
the
princess
of
wales
presented
me
with
my
certificate
of
membership
of
the
royal
national
pension
fund
for
nurses
and
i
met
many
old
friends
amongst
the
one
thousand
odd
nurses
who
were
there
it
was
a
scorching
hot
day
and
there
were
some
active
officers
of
the
scots
guards
who
had
their
work
cut
out
in
marshalling
the
crowd
of
nurses
for
their
march
past
and
we
found
it
warm
work
standing
in
the
sun
as
we
were
wearing
indoor
uniform
and
our
caps
were
not
much
protection
but
as
soon
as
that
was
over
we
found
plenty
of
shade
under
the
beautiful
trees
and
were
provided
with
ices
and
delicious
plates
of
fruit
and
other
refreshments
i
knew
a
member
of
the
household
and
she
very
kindly
took
me
round
some
of
the
royal
apartments
and
it
was
interesting
to
peep
into
the
cool
with
the
lunch
ready
laid
for
the
royalties
to
partake
of
as
soon
as
they
had
dismissed
us
but
they
stayed
chatting
with
some
of
the
nurses
for
some
time
and
altogether
we
spent
a
very
pleasant
time
there
as
i
was
travelling
home
afterwards
in
an
express
train
we
were
suddenly
pulled
up
with
a
tremendous
jerk
that
threw
us
and
our
baggage
about
the
carriage
and
when
we
had
picked
ourselves
up
and
could
look
out
of
the
window
we
discovered
that
our
carriage
was
on
fire
fortunately
a
signalman
had
noticed
it
and
telegraphed
to
the
next
to
stop
the
train
we
all
had
to
bundle
out
at
a
country
siding
and
the
carriage
was
taken
off
to
be
attended
to
by
the
men
there
while
we
and
our
baggage
were
packed
into
the
rest
of
the
train
which
already
seemed
quite
full
and
then
we
hurried
on
again
but
if
the
signalman
had
not
noticed
it
it
might
have
been
very
unpleasant
for
us
i
went
back
to
work
early
in
august
and
when
i
got
to
the
hospital
the
doctor
who
generally
looks
after
me
was
away
it
never
struck
me
that
i
needed
to
see
a
doctor
and
the
matron
did
not
think
to
suggest
it
so
i
took
over
my
new
ward
and
began
to
get
things
into
shape
and
to
my
liking
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
very
hard
work
but
i
just
put
it
down
to
the
fact
that
the
weather
was
very
hot
and
that
i
had
been
slacking
for
so
long
and
i
thought
i
must
pull
myself
together
but
in
about
a
fortnight
the
doctor
returned
and
next
day
he
came
to
see
me
and
said
i
was
not
fit
for
work
yet
so
much
to
my
disgust
i
was
bundled
off
for
more
rest
towards
the
end
of
september
i
again
got
into
harness
worked
for
about
a
fortnight
and
then
knocked
up
with
acute
neuritis
in
my
head
with
herpes
i
cross
but
the
pain
in
my
head
was
too
bad
for
me
to
worry
about
anything
else
i
was
warded
in
a
medical
ward
given
big
doses
of
morphia
at
pretty
frequent
intervals
and
generally
fussed
over
as
i
had
the
honour
of
being
a
very
interesting
and
unusual
case
when
my
head
got
better
the
pain
started
down
my
legs
sciatica
so
they
kept
me
in
bed
for
some
time
and
when
i
got
up
i
was
rather
a
wreck
and
they
said
i
must
go
south
so
once
more
i
went
off
to
stay
with
some
relations
near
southampton
and
it
was
the
middle
of
november
before
i
eventually
got
back
to
work
just
fancy
having
to
take
from
may
to
november
to
get
over
scarlet
fever
and
its
effects
especially
when
the
fever
lasted
only
about
a
couple
of
days
of
course
every
one
who
came
to
see
me
after
i
got
back
wanted
to
know
how
long
i
had
been
at
work
as
they
supposed
i
should
be
sent
off
duty
for
something
else
before
i
had
worked
a
fortnight
while
i
was
down
near
southampton
i
went
once
or
twice
to
the
docks
to
see
the
first
troops
going
off
to
south
africa
the
men
looked
very
fit
and
trim
in
their
new
khaki
suits
but
they
were
very
tight
packed
on
the
troopships
and
liners
one
day
i
saw
the
off
with
men
on
board
crowds
of
people
to
see
them
off
and
cheering
and
singing
of
auld
lang
syne
and
god
save
the
queen
some
of
them
looked
such
boys
to
go
out
and
rough
it
at
the
front
and
it
is
sad
to
think
that
they
ca
all
come
back
one
wonders
how
many
i
wish
i
could
go
too
opinions
seem
divided
as
to
whether
the
war
will
soon
be
over
or
not
xxv
tantallon
castle
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
all
my
friends
were
going
off
to
the
front
and
though
many
people
said
the
war
would
be
over
before
they
landed
we
kept
hearing
accounts
of
how
bad
the
enteric
was
and
that
the
nurses
were
being
overworked
so
i
felt
i
must
at
least
offer
to
lend
a
hand
i
was
afraid
if
i
sent
in
my
papers
in
the
ordinary
way
i
might
get
sent
to
a
home
station
to
free
some
army
sister
to
go
out
and
that
would
not
have
suited
me
at
all
so
i
thought
i
would
go
down
to
the
war
office
and
see
for
myself
if
i
could
get
sent
to
the
front
about
the
middle
of
january
i
boldly
went
down
and
asked
to
see
the
secretary
of
the
army
medical
department
i
quite
expected
to
be
told
i
could
not
do
so
without
an
appointment
but
i
think
the
orderly
must
have
thought
i
an
appointment
for
he
showed
me
into
a
and
there
a
strange
thing
happened
there
were
several
people
waiting
and
amongst
them
a
gentleman
whose
face
i
thought
i
knew
but
i
could
not
remember
where
i
had
met
him
before
after
a
few
minutes
he
came
up
to
me
and
said
i
think
you
are
miss
and
i
said
i
had
been
trying
to
think
whether
we
had
met
before
and
where
and
then
he
reminded
me
of
how
we
had
travelled
down
the
nile
on
the
same
post
boat
in
and
had
talked
of
south
africa
then
as
he
knew
of
my
brother
out
there
then
he
said
but
what
do
you
want
here
and
i
replied
like
every
one
else
i
want
to
get
sent
out
to
the
cape
after
he
had
meditated
for
a
few
minutes
he
said
well
i
offering
to
give
them
a
field
hospital
of
one
hundred
beds
and
to
run
it
for
three
months
at
the
cape
if
they
accept
it
will
you
go
with
it
of
course
i
said
i
would
like
a
shot
and
then
he
was
sent
for
to
see
the
secretary
and
i
waited
and
waited
and
thought
he
must
have
forgotten
all
about
me
but
at
last
an
orderly
came
to
say
the
secretary
wished
to
see
miss
and
the
people
who
had
been
waiting
longer
than
i
had
glared
at
me
as
i
was
escorted
to
the
secretary
room
there
i
found
my
friend
of
the
nile
still
talking
to
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
turned
to
me
with
a
frown
and
asked
me
what
i
meant
by
coming
down
to
the
war
office
without
an
appointment
instead
of
sending
for
the
application
forms
in
the
usual
way
so
i
told
him
i
did
not
intend
to
apply
in
the
usual
way
and
risk
being
sent
to
some
home
station
i
had
too
good
a
berth
in
england
to
give
it
up
for
that
but
that
if
i
found
they
would
give
me
a
chance
of
service
at
the
front
i
would
be
glad
to
go
and
do
what
i
could
that
i
knew
south
africa
and
knew
what
to
expect
in
the
way
of
climate
and
knew
how
to
manage
the
native
servants
and
so
on
then
he
melted
a
little
and
said
well
this
gentleman
has
been
most
liberal
in
offering
us
a
complete
hospital
which
we
are
going
to
accept
and
he
has
asked
for
you
to
go
with
it
so
if
you
will
send
in
your
papers
and
testimonials
in
the
usual
way
you
will
stand
a
very
good
chance
of
success
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
piece
of
good
luck
if
i
had
not
gone
down
personally
to
the
war
office
i
should
never
have
met
my
friend
of
the
nile
and
if
i
had
even
gone
five
minutes
later
i
should
never
have
met
him
and
afterwards
if
i
had
seen
in
the
papers
about
his
giving
a
hospital
i
should
never
have
thought
of
applying
to
go
with
it
as
when
we
met
on
the
nile
i
barely
knew
his
name
and
should
never
have
connected
him
with
the
hospital
i
asked
him
the
other
day
what
made
him
give
me
this
chance
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
he
told
me
that
he
did
not
wish
to
leave
the
appointment
of
the
staff
entirely
to
the
government
and
he
did
not
personally
know
any
nurse
whom
he
could
ask
and
he
thought
if
i
had
a
quarter
of
the
brains
he
knew
my
eldest
brother
to
possess
i
should
be
a
good
help
to
him
i
have
had
heaps
of
congratulations
as
every
one
says
that
though
many
sisters
and
nurses
have
gone
from
our
hospital
this
is
the
best
appointment
of
any
that
has
come
our
way
i
sat
up
most
of
that
night
filling
up
papers
required
by
the
war
office
and
copying
out
testimonials
to
send
in
with
them
also
writing
home
as
i
had
not
even
told
them
i
was
applying
to
go
for
the
next
day
or
two
my
ward
was
very
heavy
with
bad
cases
and
took
up
most
of
my
time
and
thoughts
but
on
the
third
day
i
was
sent
for
and
told
i
was
not
only
accepted
but
had
been
appointed
lady
superintendent
and
was
to
select
five
sisters
to
go
with
me
and
send
their
names
in
for
approval
they
hoped
we
should
sail
in
about
three
weeks
then
followed
a
very
busy
time
the
authorities
of
my
hospital
were
most
kind
in
being
willing
to
let
me
go
but
the
fact
that
so
many
sisters
and
nurses
were
leaving
for
the
front
was
causing
a
great
scarcity
of
seniors
so
i
felt
obliged
to
stay
as
long
as
i
possibly
could
only
going
home
for
a
long
to
say
there
were
shoals
of
letters
sent
for
me
to
deal
with
of
nurses
and
others
wishing
to
go
with
us
some
of
them
were
amusing
one
was
from
a
viscountess
another
from
a
member
of
a
theatrical
troupe
a
large
proportion
of
the
applicants
had
had
no
training
but
were
willing
to
learn
some
offered
to
pay
their
own
expenses
if
i
would
only
act
as
their
chaperon
they
seemed
to
think
we
were
going
out
for
a
picnic
however
there
were
plenty
of
applications
from
well
and
nurses
and
the
chief
difficulty
was
to
know
which
to
leave
out
i
had
to
attend
at
the
war
office
for
an
interview
with
the
selection
committee
princess
christian
was
one
serving
on
this
committee
and
she
came
and
shook
hands
with
me
and
was
most
kind
all
the
sisters
whose
names
i
had
sent
in
were
duly
appointed
to
the
army
nursing
service
reserve
and
then
having
settled
the
staff
i
had
to
help
in
choosing
the
fittings
and
stores
for
the
hospital
as
they
wished
to
take
out
everything
so
as
to
be
quite
independent
when
we
landed
wherever
we
might
be
sent
lengthy
lists
had
to
be
made
out
of
bowls
and
porringers
thermometers
splints
crutches
charts
and
syringes
bedding
and
linen
shirts
suits
for
convalescents
scrubbing
and
other
brushes
tanks
for
disinfecting
linen
there
are
so
many
things
that
seem
to
come
by
nature
in
england
which
it
would
be
most
trying
to
find
oneself
without
on
the
other
side
and
then
there
were
the
food
supplies
to
be
ordered
flour
sugar
all
groceries
invalid
foods
in
fact
everything
and
enough
of
everything
to
last
for
at
least
three
months
having
chosen
all
the
fittings
we
could
possibly
think
of
we
found
great
difficulty
in
getting
room
on
board
ship
to
despatch
our
cargo
as
men
were
being
so
urgently
called
for
and
the
ships
were
going
out
packed
with
regiments
and
their
baggage
in
the
intervals
of
running
a
heavy
surgical
ward
selecting
sisters
and
choosing
stores
i
had
to
get
my
uniform
made
and
buy
a
suitable
kit
for
a
hot
climate
i
also
bought
a
saddle
which
i
knew
would
be
useful
wherever
we
were
stationed
and
had
it
packed
in
a
case
which
took
a
good
many
other
things
inside
the
saddle
and
i
thought
if
we
were
living
in
tents
the
case
would
be
useful
to
save
some
of
my
goods
from
the
white
ants
the
hours
i
could
give
to
sleep
were
few
in
those
weeks
but
i
shall
make
up
arrears
on
board
ship
we
had
various
false
alarms
as
to
the
date
of
sailing
all
of
which
i
had
to
communicate
to
the
sisters
and
then
contradict
i
left
the
hospital
on
february
with
many
regrets
after
six
work
having
been
a
sister
or
a
night
sister
or
an
assistant
matron
there
for
the
last
five
years
we
thought
we
were
going
to
sail
at
once
but
in
the
end
it
was
decided
that
the
medical
officers
and
the
orderlies
would
have
to
leave
a
few
days
before
the
sisters
i
was
sorry
for
this
as
i
had
hoped
to
get
to
know
them
a
little
on
board
ship
before
they
sailed
who
was
providing
the
hospital
gave
a
dinner
party
to
all
the
staff
and
we
had
a
most
pleasant
evening
after
the
dinner
there
was
a
large
reception
and
i
was
introduced
to
many
people
whose
names
are
well
known
both
in
south
africa
and
in
england
the
doctors
sailed
on
february
and
on
march
i
was
at
the
army
and
navy
stores
doing
a
little
final
shopping
when
the
news
came
that
ladysmith
was
relieved
the
excitement
was
intense
such
cheering
and
waving
of
flags
and
they
set
all
the
musical
boxes
to
play
rule
britannia
had
decided
to
go
out
with
us
to
see
the
hospital
erected
and
on
march
we
sailed
from
southampton
on
the
we
have
troops
on
board
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
cheering
the
people
at
southampton
gave
us
as
we
got
away
the
is
full
up
with
officers
and
some
gentlemen
troopers
of
the
yeomanry
we
are
now
ploughing
down
the
channel
with
the
sea
so
calm
few
people
can
even
think
of
being
so
i
thought
i
would
send
you
a
yarn
and
then
you
would
understand
that
it
has
been
impossible
for
me
to
come
to
say
until
we
reach
cape
town
we
do
know
what
our
destination
will
be
in
the
meantime
i
am
having
a
good
rest
and
shall
be
quite
fit
for
any
amount
of
work
by
the
time
we
land
i
hope
to
post
this
at
madeira
xxvi
durban
natal
that
was
a
strange
voyage
out
on
the
for
one
thing
instead
of
the
usual
mixed
lot
of
passengers
the
boat
was
nearly
full
of
soldiers
there
were
very
few
ladies
on
board
besides
one
army
superintendent
sister
with
a
batch
of
sisters
and
my
little
party
of
six
also
a
few
wives
of
the
senior
officers
there
were
practically
no
old
people
or
children
on
board
as
one
would
expect
with
so
many
young
men
on
board
many
of
them
mere
boys
there
was
a
great
deal
of
fun
and
joking
and
yet
beneath
it
all
there
was
an
of
solemnity
i
think
we
all
felt
that
it
was
not
possible
that
we
should
all
return
before
we
left
we
heard
how
many
were
dying
of
enteric
and
dysentery
and
we
hoped
if
we
were
to
be
left
behind
we
should
have
a
chance
of
doing
a
bit
before
we
got
knocked
over
very
few
of
the
officers
had
ever
been
under
fire
and
they
felt
it
was
going
to
be
a
very
new
experience
and
some
of
them
talked
of
it
with
awe
i
do
mean
that
they
were
the
least
bit
funky
but
they
wondered
whether
they
would
be
certain
to
remember
how
to
manage
their
men
and
lead
them
on
as
steadily
as
if
they
were
on
parade
some
of
them
thought
they
would
be
sure
to
duck
their
heads
when
the
bullets
were
flying
and
it
would
look
so
jolly
bad
we
played
the
usual
games
on
board
but
in
the
morning
the
upper
decks
were
given
up
to
the
men
who
drilled
and
did
physical
exercises
to
keep
them
fit
at
the
request
of
colonel
we
sisters
held
some
classes
on
first
aid
about
thirty
officers
put
down
their
names
as
wishing
to
learn
and
attended
for
half
an
hour
every
morning
and
we
taught
them
simple
bandaging
how
to
stop
h√¶morrhage
and
how
to
apply
improvised
splints
at
madeira
we
could
not
get
much
in
the
way
of
news
from
the
front
so
we
supposed
that
nothing
very
exciting
had
happened
yet
we
had
a
few
hours
ashore
to
stretch
our
legs
and
paid
a
visit
to
the
fruit
market
there
was
an
american
anchored
close
to
us
and
when
we
left
she
manned
her
yards
and
the
men
cheered
tremendously
and
her
band
played
rule
britannia
there
were
three
deaths
on
board
during
the
voyage
all
reservists
and
all
from
pneumonia
it
seemed
so
awfully
sad
that
they
should
have
given
up
their
homes
and
everything
to
come
out
and
then
have
got
knocked
over
before
they
had
even
seen
the
enemy
or
fired
a
shot
i
heard
that
these
men
were
ill
before
they
came
on
board
but
would
not
report
themselves
in
case
they
should
be
left
behind
and
they
came
on
board
straight
from
their
beds
in
bitter
cold
i
have
never
been
to
sea
in
such
a
crowded
ship
before
there
were
four
in
my
cabin
and
in
a
week
or
two
at
sea
you
get
to
know
the
good
and
bad
points
of
your
cabin
mate
character
better
than
in
several
months
ashore
at
our
table
there
was
a
captain
in
charge
of
a
company
of
gentlemen
yeomanry
who
were
going
out
paying
all
their
own
expenses
it
was
rather
strange
for
him
having
his
troopers
travelling
in
the
first
saloon
he
had
been
in
the
army
but
had
given
it
up
because
he
could
not
get
five
months
free
for
hunting
besides
some
shooting
and
fishing
there
was
another
captain
also
at
our
table
who
had
been
to
general
kitchener
in
the
soudan
campaign
and
was
going
out
to
join
him
again
he
had
seen
a
lot
of
service
and
was
very
interesting
amongst
the
soldiers
in
the
there
are
two
district
messenger
boys
going
out
as
trumpeters
for
the
cape
mounted
rifles
most
of
the
officers
and
some
of
the
soldiers
were
inoculated
against
typhoid
during
the
voyage
but
for
a
scarcity
of
lymph
we
also
should
have
been
inoculated
to
avoid
waste
of
time
after
our
landing
but
we
gave
it
up
as
it
was
more
important
for
the
men
who
would
probably
be
sent
straight
up
country
sunday
on
board
was
kept
very
quietly
it
was
good
to
see
a
large
attendance
at
the
holy
communion
service
in
the
early
morning
and
the
parade
service
was
a
very
hearty
one
we
had
the
hymns
lead
kindly
light
and
onward
christian
soldiers
and
then
one
that
i
did
not
know
so
well
beginning
o
lord
be
with
us
when
we
sail
and
containing
the
two
following
verses
which
seemed
especially
appropriate
if
duty
calls
from
threaten
strife
to
guard
our
native
shore
and
shot
and
shell
are
answering
fast
the
booming
cannon
roar
be
thou
the
of
our
host
till
war
and
danger
cease
defend
the
right
put
up
the
sword
and
through
the
world
make
peace
the
last
night
on
board
we
had
a
farewell
not
sitting
at
our
usual
places
but
making
little
parties
of
our
friends
whenever
i
go
for
a
voyage
i
think
there
is
something
a
little
sad
when
it
comes
to
an
end
and
we
all
part
and
go
our
different
ways
but
there
was
something
especially
sad
in
saying
to
all
these
bright
young
fellows
who
had
to
go
off
to
face
the
shot
and
shell
we
landed
at
cape
town
on
march
and
found
that
the
troopship
with
our
medical
officers
on
board
had
arrived
only
that
morning
though
they
sailed
some
days
before
we
did
they
had
had
a
good
deal
of
illness
on
board
and
had
to
send
nearly
fifty
men
into
hospital
at
cape
town
and
they
had
had
two
deaths
during
the
voyage
soon
after
we
got
into
dock
i
received
orders
to
take
our
sisters
and
their
baggage
up
to
a
in
roeland
street
this
we
accomplished
with
the
help
of
the
agents
who
rejoice
in
the
name
of
divine
gates
but
we
had
not
been
established
there
very
long
when
i
received
further
orders
that
we
should
rejoin
our
ship
in
a
day
or
two
as
our
beds
were
more
urgently
required
round
in
natal
than
in
cape
colony
cape
town
was
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
martial
law
was
in
force
and
armed
patrols
were
riding
about
and
there
were
constant
rumours
that
the
boers
were
close
to
the
cape
the
docks
were
crowded
with
men
horses
and
stores
all
being
disembarked
and
sent
up
country
as
rapidly
as
possible
i
found
my
brother
who
had
been
on
circuit
when
the
war
began
and
could
not
get
back
to
his
home
at
kimberley
he
had
been
for
some
time
at
the
cape
and
was
shortly
going
to
england
i
met
a
good
many
friends
in
cape
town
some
from
kimberley
who
had
come
down
to
recruit
after
the
siege
all
the
civilians
whom
i
met
from
there
were
loud
in
their
appreciation
of
cecil
rhodes
and
the
way
he
had
worked
for
them
and
cheered
them
through
the
siege
his
especial
thoughtfulness
for
the
women
and
children
i
took
the
sisters
to
see
his
beautiful
house
groot
schuur
and
to
tea
with
some
old
friends
of
mine
at
kenilworth
i
was
anxious
to
see
all
i
could
of
the
military
hospitals
and
how
they
were
managed
as
i
had
had
no
experience
of
work
for
the
army
but
my
first
visit
to
a
large
military
general
hospital
was
not
encouraging
as
i
thought
the
wards
looked
dirty
and
untidy
to
a
degree
the
men
had
portions
of
food
left
on
their
lockers
from
previous
meals
and
this
food
was
covered
with
flies
knowing
how
much
enteric
there
was
in
the
camp
this
i
thought
a
great
source
of
danger
the
men
were
cheery
as
usual
but
complained
that
sleep
was
difficult
to
obtain
owing
to
the
in
the
beds
in
some
of
the
wards
the
legs
of
the
beds
were
placed
in
condensed
milk
tins
containing
some
disinfectant
but
even
this
was
not
always
successful
another
day
i
visited
the
portland
hospital
and
found
everything
very
trim
and
the
men
very
comfortable
the
sisters
had
very
nice
quarters
they
seemed
rather
horrified
to
hear
that
we
had
not
brought
any
english
maids
with
us
as
they
said
they
could
never
get
on
without
theirs
in
this
savage
land
four
miles
from
cape
town
but
i
have
had
to
do
with
servants
out
here
before
and
prefer
to
manage
with
natives
i
subsequently
visited
another
large
general
hospital
and
found
it
much
better
kept
than
the
first
one
and
the
patients
more
comfortable
so
i
conclude
it
depends
on
the
head
a
good
deal
and
not
so
much
on
the
system
a
party
of
wounded
men
came
in
while
i
was
there
most
of
them
convalescents
but
a
few
looked
rather
bad
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
long
time
before
they
were
put
to
bed
i
also
visited
the
red
cross
depot
and
saw
a
good
many
ladies
at
work
packing
bags
for
the
ambulance
trains
a
suit
of
pyjamas
a
sponge
a
handkerchief
a
little
and
a
pencil
in
each
bag
which
must
be
a
most
welcome
present
for
a
soldier
straight
from
the
veldt
we
on
the
same
ship
on
march
and
had
a
very
rough
trip
up
the
coast
calling
at
port
elizabeth
and
east
london
at
the
latter
place
the
weather
was
very
hot
with
a
cloudy
sky
and
all
the
officers
were
in
their
white
suits
when
we
were
suddenly
by
a
tremendous
with
thunder
and
lightning
and
the
wind
howling
in
the
rigging
they
had
no
time
to
change
out
of
their
white
clothes
and
in
a
few
minutes
looked
like
drowned
rats
the
steam
was
up
and
everything
made
fast
in
case
we
should
have
to
put
out
to
sea
but
the
storm
soon
passed
over
we
reached
durban
on
march
and
now
there
is
much
speculation
as
to
where
we
are
to
pitch
our
camp
xxvii
pinetown
natal
when
we
arrived
at
durban
the
town
was
very
full
and
the
sisters
had
to
stay
on
board
until
rooms
could
be
found
for
them
in
a
late
in
the
afternoon
a
tug
came
out
with
a
message
that
we
were
to
disembark
and
go
to
a
house
called
sea
breeze
in
smith
street
it
was
rather
rough
at
the
anchorage
and
we
had
to
get
into
a
basket
and
were
slung
over
the
ship
side
into
the
tug
then
the
tug
had
to
go
round
and
pick
up
a
lot
of
lighters
that
had
been
supplying
other
ships
with
coal
and
by
the
time
we
got
into
harbour
it
was
getting
dusk
and
the
customs
house
supposing
that
all
the
passengers
had
landed
earlier
was
closed
i
had
meant
to
leave
our
heavy
baggage
in
the
customs
house
till
we
knew
where
we
were
going
but
it
was
impossible
to
leave
it
loose
on
the
jetty
and
there
were
no
cabs
or
trolleys
about
but
a
mob
of
riksha
boys
dressed
up
in
feathers
and
horns
and
beads
and
very
little
else
who
were
all
clamouring
to
be
allowed
to
transport
us
up
town
eventually
we
piled
our
baggage
on
these
rikshas
and
distributing
the
sisters
amongst
it
we
gave
the
boys
the
address
and
with
much
shouting
our
cavalcade
started
off
at
a
trot
we
soon
reached
smith
street
but
then
our
troubles
began
no
one
knowing
sea
breeze
we
searched
up
and
down
the
street
and
one
old
gentleman
told
me
he
had
lived
all
his
life
in
smith
street
but
had
never
seen
a
sea
breeze
there
i
tried
all
the
places
where
i
thought
our
officers
might
be
the
depot
hotels
but
could
not
find
them
the
sisters
all
very
tired
and
hungry
and
some
of
them
rather
nervous
then
by
good
luck
we
met
our
major
who
had
come
out
to
see
if
we
were
comfortable
in
our
quarters
and
discovered
that
we
had
been
given
the
name
of
the
wrong
street
about
we
found
the
house
but
the
landlady
had
given
us
up
and
thinking
we
should
not
land
till
the
morning
had
gone
out
but
some
other
lodgers
refugees
from
johannesburg
raided
the
larder
for
our
benefit
and
we
thoroughly
enjoyed
our
supper
the
next
day
we
found
the
idea
had
been
to
send
us
up
to
mooi
river
but
it
was
thought
that
with
the
winter
coming
on
that
would
be
a
cold
place
for
sick
troops
so
we
had
better
be
nearer
the
coast
and
then
a
durban
gentleman
came
forward
and
most
kindly
offered
the
use
of
his
estate
of
acres
at
pinetown
it
is
only
about
seventeen
miles
from
durban
but
much
higher
up
and
more
healthy
so
the
offer
was
gratefully
accepted
and
the
building
was
at
once
begun
then
followed
a
time
when
we
all
had
to
forget
that
we
had
come
out
to
nurse
the
sick
and
wounded
and
turn
to
work
at
other
jobs
before
they
were
ready
for
us
to
go
up
to
pinetown
we
were
all
inoculated
against
typhoid
it
was
not
a
pleasant
experience
my
temperature
went
up
to
and
i
had
intense
abdominal
pain
and
headache
it
seemed
like
a
very
concentrated
touch
of
typhoid
but
it
kept
us
in
bed
only
two
or
three
days
and
the
following
five
or
six
days
we
felt
as
weak
as
though
we
had
been
ill
for
a
month
as
soon
as
possible
i
went
up
to
see
where
our
hospital
was
to
be
built
and
found
them
busy
levelling
the
ground
for
the
tin
pavilions
there
were
three
permanent
buildings
already
up
on
the
land
one
we
thought
would
make
a
good
ward
for
officers
eight
beds
another
had
a
large
room
we
thought
would
do
for
our
staff
and
some
small
rooms
suitable
for
medical
officers
bedrooms
and
the
third
was
a
row
of
rooms
that
was
apportioned
for
sisters
rooms
and
various
offices
stores
the
orderlies
were
established
in
tents
a
little
way
off
they
were
all
john
ambulance
men
and
camping
out
was
a
new
experience
for
them
so
of
course
they
did
not
know
how
to
make
themselves
as
comfortable
as
regular
soldiers
would
have
done
in
a
new
camp
they
had
joined
expecting
to
have
the
excitement
of
stretcher
work
at
the
front
and
when
they
were
told
off
to
level
the
ground
for
the
buildings
or
to
carry
up
the
planks
and
the
heavy
boxes
from
the
railway
trucks
and
to
help
the
builders
put
up
the
pavilions
there
was
a
good
deal
of
grumbling
at
first
the
major
in
command
would
not
hear
of
our
going
up
to
stay
until
they
had
got
some
more
of
the
stores
up
beds
sheets
but
when
he
found
how
slowly
they
got
on
and
how
discontented
the
men
were
at
having
to
rough
it
he
gave
leave
for
me
to
go
up
with
one
other
sister
as
we
thought
we
might
help
a
bit
and
at
any
rate
could
show
the
men
we
were
willing
to
take
our
share
the
hospital
we
had
brought
out
was
for
one
hundred
beds
but
there
was
urgent
need
for
more
beds
so
the
had
given
orders
that
more
huts
were
to
be
sent
to
us
and
that
we
were
to
open
as
a
two
hundred
bed
hospital
the
railway
was
so
hard
worked
that
we
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
get
trucks
to
bring
the
building
materials
up
from
durban
and
the
docks
at
durban
were
so
crowded
with
stores
that
it
was
most
difficult
to
get
the
things
through
some
of
our
medical
officers
worked
nobly
at
the
docks
getting
the
things
packed
on
to
trucks
while
the
others
superintended
the
unloading
at
pinetown
every
engine
seemed
to
be
needed
for
taking
men
horses
stores
water
up
to
the
front
and
the
only
wonder
was
that
so
few
accidents
occurred
on
the
much
single
line
of
rails
we
had
landed
on
the
last
day
of
march
and
on
the
evening
of
april
sister
and
i
went
up
to
pinetown
by
rail
taking
all
the
heavy
baggage
and
the
other
sisters
went
to
give
some
temporary
help
on
one
of
the
hospital
ships
at
durban
until
we
could
fix
up
some
rooms
for
them
some
of
the
officers
met
us
at
the
station
and
a
fatigue
party
had
brought
a
truck
for
our
baggage
a
tramp
of
about
ten
minutes
through
thick
sand
brought
us
to
our
new
abode
our
first
meal
a
kind
of
supper
was
somewhat
quaint
a
bare
deal
table
in
a
room
dimly
lighted
by
two
candles
stuck
into
bottles
plates
knives
and
forks
had
to
be
used
with
great
economy
as
there
were
not
enough
to
go
round
some
good
salt
beef
and
biscuits
and
some
fruit
and
we
were
waited
upon
by
an
orderly
in
his
shirt
sleeves
who
was
an
when
at
home
in
england
and
knew
more
about
greasing
engines
than
about
cleaning
the
grease
off
plates
the
weather
was
very
hot
and
the
officers
all
looked
dead
tired
so
we
soon
decided
to
turn
in
and
were
escorted
to
our
room
in
the
other
building
by
the
light
of
a
guttering
candle
as
there
were
said
to
be
many
snakes
about
they
had
found
us
two
beds
and
actually
some
sheets
but
absolutely
nothing
else
in
our
room
however
i
hunted
up
the
cook
and
he
lent
me
a
bucket
with
some
water
in
so
that
we
might
start
fair
with
a
wash
in
the
morning
the
next
morning
we
were
up
before
six
and
started
work
in
earnest
unpacking
cases
sorting
stores
and
putting
them
away
in
different
and
trying
to
find
the
things
we
were
most
in
need
of
for
household
use
some
of
the
hospital
fittings
had
been
put
ashore
at
cape
town
and
not
yet
sent
on
and
more
of
the
necessaries
were
still
down
at
durban
so
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
push
on
the
building
work
and
all
the
time
we
knew
the
field
hospitals
were
crowded
up
and
needing
to
send
men
down
to
us
to
give
them
a
chance
of
recovery
and
we
heard
that
the
generals
said
they
could
not
fight
any
more
till
they
could
clear
the
field
hospitals
all
the
cases
of
stores
were
numbered
so
that
when
we
wanted
any
particular
thing
we
had
to
look
up
in
the
list
the
number
of
its
case
and
then
hunt
about
till
we
found
that
number
all
day
long
it
was
have
you
seen
no
i
want
sometimes
we
found
a
lot
of
jugs
and
then
could
not
find
the
basins
sometimes
a
lot
of
saucers
and
no
cups
and
it
seemed
as
though
we
never
should
get
order
out
of
the
chaos
at
first
we
had
no
and
the
orderlies
were
all
busy
carrying
the
building
materials
up
so
sister
and
i
kept
the
bedrooms
tidy
and
the
medical
officers
in
return
carried
the
water
for
the
baths
as
soon
as
i
could
i
annexed
a
fine
old
kaffir
as
a
and
john
is
a
great
now
we
tried
first
of
all
to
fit
up
rooms
with
the
bare
necessary
furniture
for
the
rest
of
the
officers
and
sisters
so
that
they
could
all
come
up
and
help
us
if
you
saw
the
jetty
at
durban
you
would
wonder
that
any
stores
ever
got
sent
up
to
their
right
destination
literally
hundreds
of
tons
of
boxes
stacked
up
in
hopeless
confusion
durban
is
a
bit
overdone
by
military
requirements
and
quite
run
out
of
some
stores
on
april
we
were
made
very
anxious
by
a
strong
rumour
that
mafeking
had
fallen
they
say
that
the
little
children
have
died
there
yesterday
we
heard
of
the
loss
of
a
british
convoy
and
five
guns
and
also
that
the
boers
were
going
into
laager
again
quite
near
to
where
cronje
was
taken
durban
is
full
of
refugees
and
of
ladysmith
people
recruiting
after
the
siege
i
went
over
one
of
the
hospital
ships
the
before
i
came
up
here
and
it
was
melancholy
to
see
the
from
ladysmith
one
quite
young
fellow
told
me
he
had
come
here
from
india
got
typhoid
soon
after
the
siege
began
then
as
soon
as
he
began
to
convalesce
the
only
food
they
could
give
him
was
mealy
meal
and
a
little
so
he
got
dysentery
he
is
now
mending
but
it
is
slow
work
with
them
all
before
we
came
our
rooms
had
been
occupied
by
refugees
and
fleas
abound
i
catch
about
six
and
once
in
the
night
luckily
we
are
fairly
free
from
mosquitoes
it
is
awfully
hot
and
the
medical
officers
go
about
in
trousers
and
vests
only
we
wish
we
could
wear
as
little
this
is
a
very
scrappy
letter
we
work
from
to
dusk
and
then
i
have
been
scribbling
a
little
before
turning
in
but
i
am
weary
to
a
degree
and
must
fill
up
the
gaps
in
my
next
xxviii
pinetown
natal
you
must
not
expect
me
to
tell
you
anything
about
the
progress
of
the
war
the
papers
here
give
us
very
little
news
of
course
we
are
constantly
hearing
many
startling
rumours
but
they
are
frequently
contradicted
the
next
day
and
probably
you
have
more
reliable
news
of
the
doings
of
our
troops
in
your
papers
at
home
than
we
have
so
i
will
just
jot
down
things
about
our
daily
work
here
we
are
getting
into
order
by
degrees
but
at
present
life
is
rather
a
struggle
against
difficulties
you
see
we
are
not
quite
a
civil
hospital
nor
are
we
quite
a
military
hospital
for
the
beds
we
brought
out
we
were
well
equipped
and
had
many
more
comforts
than
a
military
hospital
would
have
been
provided
with
but
now
we
are
to
have
beds
and
our
resources
are
somewhat
strained
i
found
that
the
mess
waiter
was
in
his
shirt
sleeves
because
the
poor
man
had
been
nursing
a
case
of
scarlet
fever
on
board
ship
and
all
his
kit
had
to
be
burnt
so
i
fitted
him
up
in
some
pyjama
coats
to
wait
at
table
until
i
could
get
time
to
go
in
to
durban
and
buy
him
some
white
drill
jackets
after
a
few
days
work
at
unpacking
we
got
quite
civilised
in
our
room
fittings
and
sent
for
the
other
sisters
to
come
up
and
help
if
there
had
not
been
such
need
for
hurry
in
getting
the
place
ready
it
would
really
have
been
very
amusing
much
of
the
furniture
had
been
a
good
deal
damaged
on
the
way
and
we
all
tried
our
hands
at
mending
to
see
our
senior
surgeon
who
is
on
the
staff
of
a
large
hospital
in
england
sitting
on
the
ground
trying
to
fit
a
leg
on
to
a
washstand
or
to
make
a
drawer
run
into
a
chest
of
drawers
is
a
fine
sight
i
have
taken
a
few
snaps
with
my
kodak
of
the
staff
in
unprofessional
garb
and
doing
unprofessional
jobs
i
hope
they
will
come
out
all
right
but
i
do
see
much
prospect
of
having
time
to
develop
them
the
theatre
is
fitted
up
but
has
not
been
used
yet
and
is
working
hard
getting
the
room
into
order
and
his
apparatus
fixed
up
our
food
supplies
always
called
skoff
here
the
kaffirs
name
for
food
were
very
erratic
at
first
sometimes
no
meat
would
turn
up
and
then
we
made
shift
with
which
is
really
quite
good
or
sardines
sometimes
no
bread
then
we
used
the
barrel
of
biscuits
that
lived
in
the
you
have
no
idea
how
difficult
it
is
to
eat
enough
of
those
biscuits
to
satisfy
you
they
are
nearly
as
hard
as
dog
biscuits
and
in
about
you
feel
starving
again
sometimes
there
is
no
butter
then
marmalade
now
things
are
coming
up
more
regularly
and
i
hope
they
will
continue
to
do
so
as
it
is
easy
for
us
to
joke
about
short
commons
for
ourselves
but
it
is
no
joke
when
you
have
sick
men
needing
careful
feeding
up
one
thing
is
very
nice
and
that
is
that
the
fruit
is
nearly
ripe
and
we
shall
soon
have
plenty
of
pineapples
and
oranges
our
cook
seems
to
try
to
make
the
best
of
things
he
is
only
quite
a
lad
but
he
is
managing
to
cook
for
us
all
including
the
men
with
only
wood
under
a
sort
of
gridiron
in
the
open
air
there
was
much
joy
the
other
day
when
we
came
across
a
case
of
crushed
oats
and
nearly
all
seem
to
enjoy
porridge
for
breakfast
as
it
is
still
very
hot
the
food
supplies
are
difficult
to
manage
the
meat
hardly
keeping
from
one
meal
to
another
even
when
cooked
and
with
very
limited
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
that
everything
is
kept
covered
up
and
so
far
we
have
had
no
fresh
milk
but
now
two
cows
have
arrived
and
i
am
having
to
watch
the
boys
milk
them
as
we
pay
for
the
milk
by
the
number
of
bottles
supplied
we
have
just
heard
that
the
poor
old
has
gone
down
on
her
voyage
out
no
lives
lost
but
we
fear
our
letters
have
gone
to
the
bottom
with
her
one
thing
i
am
worried
about
is
that
a
big
tank
i
had
especially
asked
to
have
in
which
we
might
boil
all
the
typhoid
linen
has
been
broken
on
the
way
and
i
do
think
i
shall
be
able
to
get
another
we
are
establishing
a
place
for
the
washerwomen
behind
the
hospital
on
a
slope
where
their
water
will
run
away
from
our
direction
i
should
like
to
have
had
a
separate
place
for
the
staff
washing
but
can
not
manage
it
so
must
be
contented
with
keeping
special
women
and
special
tubs
for
it
the
men
are
really
working
very
well
now
and
it
is
hard
work
they
have
to
do
they
required
a
good
deal
of
persuasion
to
work
on
saturday
afternoon
but
we
hear
the
field
hospitals
are
crowded
up
with
sick
on
this
side
alone
so
we
must
push
on
the
building
we
are
getting
everything
into
order
in
the
big
so
that
as
soon
as
any
of
the
big
pavilions
are
finished
we
shall
have
all
the
fittings
quite
ready
to
issue
i
have
been
down
to
see
the
in
durban
he
seems
very
nice
and
willing
to
give
us
all
the
help
he
can
he
seems
glad
that
we
are
going
to
have
the
extra
beds
and
promises
to
send
us
more
doctors
sisters
and
orderlies
we
rather
hope
that
some
of
the
orderlies
will
be
men
and
that
they
will
put
a
little
backbone
into
our
crew
who
i
daresay
will
be
better
when
we
get
into
order
but
many
of
them
are
now
rather
inclined
to
say
we
did
pass
our
exams
and
come
out
here
to
do
navvies
work
of
course
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
the
larger
place
as
i
know
it
is
so
badly
needed
but
the
prospect
of
seeing
sick
men
properly
looked
after
by
these
untrained
men
was
alarming
and
now
the
prospect
of
sick
men
with
more
possibly
untrained
orderlies
plus
some
unknown
sisters
is
more
alarming
still
but
i
suppose
we
shall
shake
along
somehow
i
shall
be
so
glad
when
the
men
can
get
time
to
cut
the
long
grass
round
the
camp
as
there
are
a
good
many
snakes
about
two
have
been
killed
quite
near
my
room
we
all
wear
canvas
gaiters
as
a
sort
of
protection
but
there
are
other
weird
creatures
about
and
one
night
a
wire
came
from
the
next
station
to
say
that
a
leopard
or
some
such
creature
had
carried
off
a
kaffir
baby
and
we
were
to
look
out
for
the
beast
so
the
men
were
much
excited
but
they
have
not
seen
anything
of
him
last
sunday
was
easter
sunday
and
the
men
had
a
much
needed
day
of
rest
but
the
sisters
and
officers
went
on
most
of
the
day
unpacking
and
sorting
the
things
most
urgently
needed
we
knocked
off
in
the
evening
and
went
to
service
at
the
pinetown
church
the
next
day
april
we
had
started
work
as
usual
when
the
whistle
summoned
all
hands
a
wire
had
come
to
say
that
a
troop
train
had
been
thrown
off
the
line
about
three
miles
from
here
the
major
went
off
with
the
medical
officers
and
orderlies
with
stretchers
i
provided
them
with
brandy
water
a
mug
a
corkscrew
and
then
hunted
up
some
lint
and
bandages
and
a
few
splints
and
sent
them
after
them
two
or
three
orderlies
who
were
sick
in
camp
came
down
to
see
what
the
alarm
meant
and
wanted
to
go
to
help
but
they
did
not
look
fit
for
a
three
miles
run
in
the
burning
sun
so
i
told
them
to
collect
all
the
natives
who
were
left
behind
and
we
made
a
hasty
clearance
of
the
building
that
was
to
be
an
officers
ward
temporarily
used
as
a
we
set
several
boys
to
work
to
scrub
the
floor
and
clean
the
windows
while
the
orderlies
fitted
some
beds
together
and
the
sisters
collected
the
bedding
and
made
them
up
and
i
got
the
most
necessary
ward
fittings
out
of
the
store
so
that
when
the
stretcher
party
arrived
we
had
quite
a
workable
little
surgical
ward
ready
for
them
two
poor
fellows
had
been
killed
and
fifteen
mules
were
either
dead
or
had
to
be
shot
three
men
of
the
army
service
corps
were
injured
one
with
a
badly
broken
leg
and
the
others
with
concussion
and
two
black
had
each
a
dreadfully
smashed
up
arm
the
major
had
a
tent
pitched
for
these
natives
not
far
from
the
ward
it
is
a
wonder
they
were
not
killed
as
they
were
in
the
same
truck
with
the
poor
mules
one
sister
and
some
orderlies
were
told
off
to
look
after
these
our
first
patients
and
then
we
returned
to
our
building
occupations
i
did
not
put
a
night
sister
on
for
these
few
cases
but
i
take
a
prowl
round
some
time
during
the
night
the
fleas
always
wake
me
up
at
least
once
otherwise
i
am
so
tired
i
do
think
i
could
wake
myself
just
to
see
that
the
orderlies
are
awake
and
managing
all
right
and
the
medical
officers
go
round
the
last
thing
before
turning
in
and
we
are
all
about
by
one
of
the
injured
men
had
been
ill
before
he
arrived
here
and
it
looks
as
though
he
is
in
for
typhoid
last
night
after
a
more
than
usually
scorching
day
we
had
torrents
of
rain
the
poor
orderlies
were
washed
out
of
their
tents
and
all
their
things
were
soaked
they
are
not
used
to
roughing
it
and
do
enjoy
it
it
seems
ever
so
long
since
i
came
up
here
but
i
had
been
here
only
four
days
before
these
cases
came
in
and
we
hope
in
about
another
week
to
be
able
to
send
word
that
we
are
ready
to
receive
patients
from
the
front
xxix
pinetown
natal
now
we
are
really
at
work
at
last
and
though
i
ca
say
everything
is
working
very
smoothly
i
think
the
patients
are
being
well
looked
after
and
i
suppose
we
must
expect
to
have
to
worry
through
difficulties
for
some
time
to
come
on
april
the
princess
christian
hospital
train
brought
us
fourteen
officers
and
sixteen
men
all
stretcher
cases
and
all
very
ill
they
had
come
from
field
hospitals
and
if
one
did
not
know
how
impossible
it
is
to
nurse
them
or
even
feed
them
up
there
one
would
say
it
was
almost
murder
to
have
sent
them
a
journey
of
many
hours
over
miles
in
a
jolting
train
there
were
no
wounded
in
this
first
batch
and
i
think
only
about
four
or
five
who
were
not
suffering
from
typhoid
in
one
stage
or
another
from
a
few
days
up
to
three
weeks
or
more
it
was
day
and
night
work
for
us
for
the
first
two
or
three
days
as
each
man
seemed
to
need
individual
nursing
if
he
was
to
have
a
chance
of
pulling
round
the
orderlies
though
very
willing
had
everything
to
learn
of
ward
duties
they
could
not
even
undress
these
men
when
they
had
been
lifted
on
to
their
beds
much
less
had
they
any
idea
of
washing
them
a
delirious
man
was
a
new
experience
to
them
and
if
he
got
out
of
bed
and
lay
on
the
floor
the
orderly
would
go
and
ask
sister
what
he
had
better
do
the
doctors
told
us
that
four
of
these
patients
could
not
live
through
the
first
night
several
of
them
had
severe
h√¶morrhage
but
they
all
struggled
through
that
night
and
it
was
a
week
later
when
one
poor
fellow
of
the
royal
artillery
slipped
through
our
fingers
from
sheer
exhaustion
without
ever
having
become
conscious
his
mates
told
us
that
he
had
been
in
a
hospital
previously
with
a
sunstroke
and
had
been
down
with
typhoid
for
some
time
before
he
arrived
here
i
ca
describe
the
condition
of
these
men
they
have
not
had
their
clothes
off
for
weeks
creeping
things
are
numerous
but
we
are
getting
them
clean
by
degrees
those
who
have
been
ill
some
time
have
sore
backs
i
ca
say
as
they
have
had
no
beds
many
of
them
have
come
from
elandslaagte
and
i
believe
they
are
very
short
of
both
milk
and
water
up
there
none
of
the
latter
for
washing
purposes
several
of
the
men
had
been
with
us
over
a
week
before
they
became
conscious
of
their
surroundings
at
all
but
in
the
case
of
those
who
conscious
the
comforts
of
a
good
bed
and
a
good
wash
brought
tears
of
gratitude
to
their
eyes
with
many
of
them
it
was
months
since
they
had
slept
in
a
bed
few
have
done
so
since
they
landed
in
this
country
and
some
of
them
seem
such
boys
to
have
gone
through
so
much
i
spent
a
good
deal
of
my
time
at
first
helping
the
sister
in
the
officers
ward
getting
her
patients
washed
and
made
comfortable
and
it
was
most
piteous
to
see
these
young
fellows
most
of
them
probably
brought
up
in
luxury
so
wasted
and
thin
and
grateful
for
the
little
that
we
could
spare
time
to
do
for
their
comfort
lieutenant
had
been
laid
up
for
two
months
with
a
bullet
in
the
groin
and
is
now
very
ill
again
with
typhoid
captain
of
the
had
been
all
through
the
siege
of
ladysmith
and
had
typhoid
up
there
now
he
has
liver
trouble
and
looks
wretchedly
ill
i
fancy
he
will
have
to
go
home
for
operation
captain
of
the
royal
artillery
was
the
worst
case
of
typhoid
amongst
the
officers
for
some
time
his
temperature
persisting
in
keeping
up
to
and
and
he
was
very
delirious
he
was
always
thinking
he
could
see
parties
of
boers
and
he
told
me
i
was
the
worst
scout
he
had
ever
come
across
as
i
did
not
see
them
he
is
doing
well
now
lieutenant
of
the
army
service
corps
had
been
ill
for
four
weeks
with
typhoid
before
he
was
landed
here
still
with
a
very
high
temperature
he
told
me
that
no
less
than
five
times
had
he
been
moved
on
a
stretcher
from
one
place
to
another
as
his
regiment
shifted
about
and
he
said
that
the
order
to
move
always
seemed
to
come
in
the
evening
when
his
temperature
was
at
its
highest
and
he
was
feeling
so
bad
that
at
last
he
begged
them
to
leave
him
behind
to
die
they
had
never
been
able
to
give
him
suitable
food
and
often
not
enough
of
unsuitable
and
when
at
last
he
got
to
the
line
he
had
miles
of
jolting
over
a
rail
before
he
reached
us
such
treatment
for
a
case
that
at
home
we
should
be
almost
afraid
to
lift
from
one
bed
to
another
but
he
is
really
mending
now
and
i
hope
we
shall
soon
be
able
to
send
him
home
to
recruit
i
have
never
had
to
give
so
much
stimulant
to
any
patients
as
we
have
had
to
give
to
these
men
all
the
first
night
i
was
going
round
giving
milk
and
brandy
or
bovril
to
the
worst
cases
while
the
night
sister
sponged
those
whose
temperatures
were
the
highest
several
of
the
men
were
on
ten
ounces
of
brandy
for
the
first
few
days
they
have
been
so
overworked
and
underfed
for
some
months
past
that
they
did
not
seem
to
have
an
ounce
of
strength
left
to
battle
with
the
fever
an
army
lady
superintendent
is
supposed
to
take
charge
of
a
ward
herself
generally
the
officers
ward
but
i
have
not
taken
a
ward
yet
as
until
we
fill
up
there
are
enough
sisters
and
it
seems
more
profitable
for
me
to
go
round
supplying
the
sisters
needs
from
the
stores
looking
after
the
cooking
and
the
and
the
washerwomen
i
fear
that
my
hair
will
turn
grey
in
my
efforts
to
keep
the
typhoid
linen
separate
to
say
nothing
of
the
cows
which
are
not
a
success
and
we
have
had
to
resort
to
frozen
milk
from
australia
generally
good
but
sometimes
there
is
a
difficulty
about
unfreezing
it
we
have
no
quartermaster
here
and
the
man
in
charge
of
the
stores
is
quite
unused
to
his
job
so
i
have
to
see
to
a
great
many
things
with
which
an
army
lady
superintendent
has
as
a
rule
nothing
to
do
i
am
very
much
afraid
some
of
our
orderlies
will
be
getting
typhoid
of
course
they
find
it
difficult
to
realise
a
danger
they
ca
see
and
though
we
all
lecture
them
about
taking
precautions
we
are
so
busy
ourselves
that
it
is
difficult
to
enforce
them
and
just
at
first
there
were
so
many
patients
quite
unconscious
and
with
severe
diarrhoea
and
h√¶morrhage
so
that
it
meant
constant
changing
of
sheets
by
the
orderlies
i
think
i
told
you
some
of
the
orderlies
were
ill
when
our
first
patients
from
the
train
accident
arrived
it
proved
to
be
a
form
of
dengue
fever
they
had
and
now
the
medical
officers
also
are
indulging
in
it
it
is
rather
like
influenza
high
fever
for
two
or
three
days
and
then
they
are
very
weak
and
pulled
down
for
a
few
more
days
i
only
hope
the
sisters
will
refrain
from
having
it
until
the
orderlies
have
had
a
little
more
education
at
present
they
are
about
as
useful
as
an
average
at
home
and
the
sisters
have
to
act
as
sister
staff
nurse
and
probationer
too
but
i
do
want
to
grumble
at
them
as
they
are
working
well
anxious
to
learn
and
very
patient
with
the
men
some
of
them
half
delirious
who
call
orderly
orderly
all
day
long
if
they
had
had
a
few
men
amongst
them
or
even
one
or
two
it
would
have
been
easier
as
it
is
there
is
not
a
single
man
amongst
them
who
knows
anything
of
the
usual
routine
in
a
hospital
though
they
are
well
up
in
first
aid
for
which
we
have
no
use
here
the
buildings
are
getting
on
and
we
are
ready
for
more
patients
as
soon
as
they
can
get
a
train
to
bring
them
down
we
hear
nothing
of
more
medical
officers
sisters
or
orderlies
as
yet
one
of
the
men
said
to
me
that
he
did
not
think
any
of
us
could
understand
what
a
luxury
it
was
to
have
a
wash
a
comfortable
bed
and
clean
clothes
that
for
months
he
had
been
marching
and
sleeping
in
the
open
in
one
suit
of
clothes
frequently
wet
through
and
remaining
wet
until
the
sun
came
out
to
dry
them
he
said
that
on
the
high
veldt
the
nights
were
very
cold
and
they
frequently
had
nothing
but
their
greatcoats
to
sleep
in
if
they
were
lucky
and
the
baggage
waggons
had
kept
up
with
them
they
would
also
have
a
blanket
and
perhaps
a
mackintosh
sheet
but
that
the
baggage
waggons
had
a
habit
of
getting
stuck
at
the
last
drift
and
then
they
had
only
what
they
carried
if
we
had
only
come
out
to
south
africa
to
nurse
this
one
batch
of
thirty
officers
and
men
back
to
health
i
think
it
would
have
been
worth
while
for
they
were
just
about
as
bad
as
they
well
could
be
and
one
ca
help
thinking
of
the
anxiety
of
their
poor
friends
at
home
who
will
have
seen
them
reported
on
the
danger
lists
from
their
field
hospitals
and
we
go
plodding
on
night
and
day
trying
to
make
them
pull
round
only
one
man
has
died
and
i
think
the
rest
will
get
on
though
some
of
them
are
still
pretty
bad
captain
had
cheyne
stokes
breathing
for
two
nights
and
made
us
very
anxious
but
now
he
is
distinctly
better
the
bishop
of
pretoria
came
to
lunch
with
us
the
other
day
and
was
very
nice
in
visiting
the
men
we
are
expecting
more
men
any
day
now
and
on
the
of
this
month
we
are
to
be
officially
opened
on
princess
christian
birthday
i
believe
a
crowd
of
people
are
expected
from
durban
and
from
pietermaritzburg
i
could
not
help
thinking
the
other
day
when
all
these
thirty
men
were
dumped
in
upon
us
in
a
couple
of
hours
of
the
old
days
in
london
when
we
thought
we
had
had
a
very
heavy
day
if
six
or
eight
patients
were
admitted
to
our
ward
in
a
day
and
there
we
had
everything
ready
to
hand
and
several
nurses
to
help
here
i
can
see
it
will
take
a
little
time
before
the
sisters
will
realise
that
it
is
useless
to
try
to
have
things
done
just
the
same
as
we
can
at
home
and
for
them
to
distinguish
between
the
of
good
nursing
which
we
must
have
and
the
superfluous
finish
which
we
must
do
without
xxx
pinetown
natal
we
have
had
a
stiff
time
of
work
since
i
wrote
last
i
think
i
told
you
that
several
orderlies
were
ill
when
our
first
cases
came
in
with
dengue
fever
and
soon
the
medical
officers
began
knocking
up
with
it
first
one
and
then
another
next
the
sisters
took
it
no
one
has
been
very
ill
but
the
fever
was
high
for
several
days
and
of
course
they
were
weak
and
seedy
after
it
went
down
so
we
have
not
had
a
full
staff
at
work
for
some
time
and
with
lots
of
bad
cases
in
the
wards
it
has
made
things
very
difficult
several
odd
cases
have
been
straying
in
and
on
the
we
took
in
five
officers
and
then
on
the
of
last
month
we
admitted
eight
officers
and
thirty
men
from
modder
spruit
most
of
them
very
ill
and
one
poor
fellow
so
bad
with
h√¶morrhage
enteric
that
he
died
the
same
night
we
had
to
open
a
second
officers
ward
and
the
sister
put
in
charge
was
very
hopeless
at
having
so
many
bad
cases
and
such
inefficient
help
so
i
had
to
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
helping
her
look
after
the
worst
cases
and
then
the
next
morning
after
they
arrived
i
found
she
had
dengue
fever
and
could
not
come
on
duty
so
i
had
to
take
charge
of
her
ward
for
a
few
days
and
do
the
best
i
could
in
looking
after
the
patients
with
the
help
of
the
orderlies
amidst
constant
interruptions
and
appeals
for
help
or
advice
from
different
parts
of
the
camp
with
every
one
so
new
to
the
work
the
cook
quite
unused
to
military
ways
or
the
serving
of
hospital
diets
the
storekeeper
hardly
knowing
where
anything
is
or
whether
he
ought
to
issue
it
when
he
did
know
ten
kaffir
women
washing
who
could
not
read
the
marks
on
the
linen
and
so
were
quite
incapable
of
returning
it
to
the
right
place
without
my
assistance
and
to
do
the
house
work
several
new
kaffir
boys
who
really
are
quite
raw
and
want
constant
looking
after
they
rejoice
in
the
names
of
john
monday
charlie
and
they
can
speak
about
six
words
of
english
between
them
and
it
is
awfully
funny
hearing
the
orderlies
trying
to
make
them
understand
with
much
other
work
needing
to
be
done
in
connection
with
fitting
up
new
wards
and
preparing
for
our
opening
day
ceremony
you
can
imagine
it
was
difficult
to
be
tied
up
in
one
ward
with
a
lot
of
sick
officers
who
required
one
best
attention
and
more
but
it
had
to
be
done
and
i
had
to
leave
the
rest
to
do
the
best
they
could
only
going
round
to
attend
to
the
most
necessary
things
when
i
could
spare
in
the
day
and
after
the
night
sister
came
on
at
night
my
worst
case
was
poor
captain
of
the
dragoons
who
was
desperately
bad
from
the
day
he
came
in
and
was
delirious
most
of
the
time
lieutenant
of
the
same
regiment
a
friend
of
his
was
very
good
in
sitting
with
him
for
part
of
the
day
and
when
he
was
at
his
worst
one
of
the
other
sisters
and
i
took
turns
of
acting
night
special
as
the
night
sister
could
not
possibly
stay
with
him
much
but
he
had
been
thoroughly
worn
out
with
the
hardships
of
the
campaign
before
he
got
the
fever
and
though
he
lingered
on
so
that
we
kept
hoping
he
would
pull
through
he
died
on
the
of
may
our
first
death
amongst
the
officers
and
we
all
felt
very
sad
it
was
terrible
for
lieutenant
ill
with
rheumatism
as
he
knows
the
captain
relations
and
has
been
cabling
to
them
daily
the
funeral
was
the
next
day
and
the
kindly
stopped
a
goods
train
here
so
that
the
few
officer
patients
who
were
well
enough
might
go
to
pinetown
to
attend
and
all
the
medical
officers
who
could
leave
also
went
i
was
too
busy
to
go
but
i
helped
lieutenant
to
make
a
cross
of
white
flowers
to
put
on
the
coffin
a
thing
that
always
makes
me
feel
creepy
when
i
am
working
in
the
store
is
the
sight
in
one
corner
of
a
little
pile
of
coffins
that
have
been
sent
up
from
durban
of
course
it
is
really
necessary
to
keep
them
ready
as
in
this
climate
the
funeral
must
be
the
day
following
the
death
but
we
have
had
them
covered
up
now
as
i
did
not
like
the
men
to
see
them
when
they
went
up
to
the
store
for
things
all
that
last
batch
of
men
were
frightfully
poisoned
with
enteric
and
nothing
seemed
to
stop
it
six
of
them
have
died
and
most
of
them
had
symptoms
of
blood
poisoning
too
i
do
think
i
told
you
that
the
two
sisters
who
went
to
help
on
one
of
the
hospital
ships
till
we
could
get
rooms
ready
for
them
came
up
at
the
beginning
of
may
they
brought
a
poor
account
of
the
nursing
on
that
particular
ship
and
said
that
when
they
went
away
there
was
no
nurse
left
on
board
that
a
large
proportion
of
the
men
who
had
been
ill
any
length
of
time
had
sore
backs
some
before
they
reached
the
ship
it
seems
sad
that
when
there
are
so
many
nurses
in
england
longing
to
come
out
these
poor
fellows
should
not
be
getting
the
best
nursing
they
might
have
even
right
down
at
the
base
on
the
of
may
we
heard
that
mafeking
was
really
relieved
and
on
the
of
may
we
were
officially
opened
general
wolfe
murray
was
to
have
performed
the
ceremony
but
he
could
not
come
as
general
buller
had
sent
for
him
so
the
bishop
of
natal
and
colonel
morris
did
it
between
them
there
were
special
trains
from
maritzburg
and
durban
a
good
many
people
to
lunch
and
such
a
crowd
in
the
afternoon
no
one
seems
to
know
how
many
but
i
think
we
gave
tea
to
about
five
hundred
fortunately
sister
was
on
duty
again
so
i
was
not
fixed
up
in
her
ward
but
she
was
still
needing
help
with
her
bad
cases
i
made
the
teabags
in
the
middle
of
the
night
while
i
took
my
turn
at
sitting
by
poor
captain
and
several
people
who
live
near
here
were
very
kind
in
helping
me
arrange
flowers
on
the
day
and
they
cut
up
cake
for
me
we
had
a
lot
of
coolie
waiters
up
from
durban
and
our
and
some
whom
a
most
kindly
neighbour
sent
to
help
were
washing
up
all
the
afternoon
i
ca
say
i
enjoyed
the
day
as
we
had
several
patients
very
ill
and
two
poor
fellows
died
that
day
but
we
managed
to
keep
their
ward
and
one
of
the
officers
wards
closed
to
visitors
so
they
were
not
disturbed
and
everything
went
smoothly
and
well
when
the
visitors
were
leaving
i
asked
the
major
if
the
orderlies
might
come
and
finish
up
the
cakes
as
there
was
some
good
tea
in
the
urns
still
and
they
had
all
been
working
very
well
so
he
told
the
they
might
i
was
rather
amused
at
one
thing
i
took
a
big
tin
and
gave
it
to
the
asking
him
to
save
a
few
cakes
for
the
night
orderlies
but
he
pointed
out
to
me
they
were
all
present
the
news
of
a
tea
and
some
good
skoff
had
brought
them
all
down
from
their
tents
and
they
soon
made
short
work
of
the
remains
i
went
into
durban
one
day
to
do
some
necessary
shopping
and
on
the
train
met
colonel
galway
the
going
down
to
inspect
the
hospital
ships
he
was
very
nice
to
me
and
told
me
that
if
i
liked
to
engage
any
more
sisters
out
here
i
might
do
so
and
he
would
take
them
on
so
i
am
engaging
a
lady
as
a
kind
of
probationer
and
housekeeper
her
husband
is
at
the
front
and
she
wants
to
help
and
i
think
she
will
be
able
to
relieve
me
a
good
deal
by
looking
after
the
putting
out
linen
our
sisters
are
working
awfully
well
but
some
of
them
do
get
on
well
with
the
orderlies
a
great
mistake
they
do
seem
able
to
hide
the
fact
that
they
think
the
orderlies
very
useless
and
incapable
and
consequently
the
orderlies
do
do
their
best
in
working
with
them
it
is
a
great
pity
as
the
men
are
quite
willing
and
anxious
to
learn
and
are
very
patient
in
having
to
do
many
jobs
that
must
be
very
trying
to
them
at
last
i
have
got
a
nice
white
woman
to
look
after
the
kaffir
washing
ladies
and
she
will
do
the
starching
for
the
staff
two
of
the
kaffirs
were
washing
all
day
with
babies
tied
on
their
backs
such
jolly
fat
and
shiny
little
i
gave
them
an
empty
with
some
sawdust
in
it
and
a
mat
and
both
the
babies
and
mothers
were
delighted
i
actually
had
a
ride
the
other
day
kindly
lent
me
a
horse
and
i
rode
with
the
major
over
to
a
most
interesting
trappist
monastery
the
trappist
fathers
cultivate
a
lot
of
land
and
teach
the
native
boys
various
trades
they
are
going
to
supply
us
with
eggs
vegetables
and
the
major
arranged
with
them
that
they
should
visit
our
roman
catholic
patients
and
if
any
of
them
die
they
will
bury
them
in
their
churchyard
we
shall
have
to
have
a
horse
for
funeral
purposes
and
we
have
been
offered
a
rather
black
animal
so
i
hope
that
to
my
varied
duties
will
be
added
that
of
keeping
the
funeral
horse
exercised
i
do
care
much
for
walking
about
here
there
is
so
much
long
grass
and
you
get
covered
with
ticks
to
say
nothing
of
one
natural
fear
of
snakes
so
an
occasional
hour
or
two
on
horseback
will
be
refreshing
though
up
to
now
i
have
hardly
left
the
camp
except
to
go
to
church
at
pinetown
once
on
sundays
i
had
a
letter
the
other
day
from
the
secretary
of
the
durban
club
to
say
they
had
made
us
all
honorary
members
a
very
kind
and
friendly
attention
on
their
part
it
is
a
nice
club
but
whether
we
shall
ever
have
time
to
make
use
of
it
remains
to
be
proved
there
are
many
strange
animals
about
here
a
huge
owl
is
getting
quite
tame
and
comes
to
be
fed
by
the
night
sister
the
men
are
trying
to
shoot
a
wild
cat
but
ca
get
up
near
to
it
after
hearing
them
talking
about
it
i
was
rather
frightened
the
other
night
sleeping
with
my
door
and
window
open
when
something
jumped
from
the
window
on
to
my
bed
i
felt
it
creeping
towards
me
and
was
just
going
to
dive
under
the
bedclothes
when
it
began
to
purr
and
i
found
it
was
the
camp
kitten
xxxi
pinetown
natal
it
is
rather
difficult
to
know
what
to
write
about
that
will
interest
you
there
is
always
plenty
of
work
but
it
is
not
of
an
exciting
nature
just
steady
plodding
on
with
difficulties
always
cropping
up
and
having
to
be
waded
through
if
one
had
time
to
sit
and
talk
to
the
patients
one
could
hear
many
exciting
tales
but
most
of
my
time
is
spent
with
those
who
are
too
ill
for
much
conversation
i
think
i
told
you
of
the
arrival
of
the
officers
and
men
from
modder
spruit
opening
the
large
ward
for
these
officers
caused
some
difficulty
as
it
is
such
a
long
way
from
the
kitchen
but
we
soon
got
up
from
durban
some
hot
tins
covers
and
the
feeding
is
going
better
now
major
had
been
very
ill
with
ptomaine
poisoning
before
he
arrived
here
he
has
been
a
difficult
case
to
feed
in
this
climate
and
has
been
very
slow
in
getting
up
any
strength
but
he
is
well
on
the
mend
now
then
there
was
a
with
acute
rheumatism
who
said
he
had
not
been
in
bed
for
six
months
and
it
was
just
heavenly
lieutenant
a
bishop

and
we
have
to
wrap
up
his
feet
on
a
chair
beyond
the
end
of
his
bed
he
has
enteric
but
not
so
very
badly
he
called
me
to
him
the
other
day
and
told
me
that
he
had
had
the
most
bitter
disappointment
of
his
life
the
doctor
had
ordered
him
an
egg
and
he
waited
patiently
till
expecting
a
nice
boiled
egg
but
he
never
knew
the
orderly
would
bring
him
a
egg
and
he
had
nearly
drunk
it
before
he
recognised
it
then
there
is
who
looks
about
sixteen
and
who
only
joined
his
regiment
nine
months
ago
but
he
has
seen
a
lot
of
fighting
and
was
at
spion
kop
pieter
hill
and
other
battles
some
of
his
men
are
here
and
they
think
a
great
deal
of
him
they
say
at
spion
kop
all
his
seniors
were
either
killed
or
wounded
but
he
led
the
men
on
as
calmly
and
well
as
possible
i
believe
he
got
a
mention
for
it
his
captain
wrote
to
me
so
nicely
asking
after
him
and
said
he
is
a
good
boy
and
when
the
bullets
are
flying
he
had
been
wounded
badly
and
now
has
enteric
but
only
slightly
the
other
officers
all
call
him
the
boy
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
send
him
home
to
his
people
soon
as
i
think
he
has
done
his
share
some
of
these
officers
are
beginning
to
get
about
now
and
they
go
to
visit
the
officers
in
the
small
ward
and
persuade
them
to
give
them
tea
there
and
then
return
and
get
their
own
tea
as
well
they
say
they
are
making
up
for
past
hardships
amongst
that
same
batch
of
men
there
were
two
or
three
rather
smart
men
and
we
do
think
they
are
going
to
be
fit
for
duty
at
the
front
again
this
campaign
they
will
be
quite
contented
to
stay
here
and
work
as
soon
as
they
are
well
enough
we
have
just
got
the
electric
light
into
working
order
and
though
it
is
rather
erratic
and
often
goes
out
on
the
whole
it
is
a
great
comfort
there
has
been
a
case
of
bubonic
plague
in
durban
but
they
do
seem
to
think
it
is
likely
to
spread
twenty
more
orderlies
have
arrived
john
ambulance
men
and
the
buildings
were
all
complete
by
the
end
of
may
i
have
had
a
few
rides
on
the
funeral
horse
and
as
it
is
very
tame
in
harness
i
was
astonished
to
find
it
was
quite
gay
and
hard
to
hold
but
we
have
found
out
that
it
was
once
a
racehorse
and
of
course
it
has
never
had
a
on
before
our
nice
compounder
has
been
awfully
ill
with
appendicitis
and
dysentery
we
have
had
to
write
each
mail
to
his
people
but
now
i
am
glad
to
say
he
is
doing
well
several
of
the
orderlies
are
down
with
enteric
including
our
waiter
so
has
to
wait
on
our
mess
of
eighteen
and
needs
a
good
deal
of
looking
after
i
expect
they
will
give
me
another
orderly
soon
but
so
many
are
ill
and
the
wards
are
heavy
and
need
a
good
many
men
for
night
duty
every
few
nights
the
orderlies
have
to
do
a
spell
on
night
as
well
as
their
ordinary
day
duty
so
they
are
rather
inclined
to
grumble
and
it
is
difficult
for
them
to
keep
awake
but
i
do
think
any
of
them
do
longer
hours
than
i
do
as
i
prowl
about
a
good
deal
in
the
night
when
the
cases
first
come
down
and
are
bad
so
they
do
grumble
too
loud
the
sisters
seemed
to
be
getting
rather
fagged
out
so
i
have
begun
to
give
them
in
turn
a
monthly
day
off
and
i
look
after
their
wards
i
find
it
is
rather
useful
as
i
get
a
good
opportunity
of
seeing
how
they
have
managed
and
also
of
learning
how
much
the
orderlies
are
good
for
it
is
quite
touching
how
good
they
are
to
me
they
want
to
show
me
they
can
be
trusted
and
they
do
everything
they
possibly
can
to
save
me
trouble
on
these
days
off
from
the
downwards
they
have
always
been
very
nice
to
me
and
i
am
sure
i
do
very
little
for
them
except
when
they
are
ill
and
need
fussing
over
beyond
scolding
them
for
misdeeds
for
which
the
sisters
report
them
i
wonder
whether
they
guess
that
all
the
time
i
feel
that
the
sisters
are
expecting
too
much
of
them
i
was
amused
when
a
new
sergeant
arrived
with
twenty
men
the
other
day
of
course
at
first
they
did
not
know
any
of
us
and
when
i
met
them
and
said
good
morning
they
simply
gaped
the
next
day
i
had
a
fatigue
party
sent
up
to
tidy
the
china
and
linen
store
of
course
our
old
batch
of
men
saluted
when
i
went
to
show
them
what
i
wanted
done
and
i
expect
the
new
men
received
a
few
words
from
them
on
their
slack
manners
afterwards
for
since
then
there
has
been
a
very
stiff
draw
up
and
salute
whenever
they
come
for
orders
or
with
a
message
i
hear
the
army
sisters
are
not
saluted
as
a
rule
i
think
i
told
you
how
much
we
suffered
from
fleas
at
first
now
they
are
quite
banished
we
have
twenty
coolies
and
a
good
orderly
in
charge
of
them
and
they
do
all
the
sanitary
work
and
sweep
and
scrub
and
generally
keep
the
place
tidy
they
also
have
to
dig
the
graves
and
since
we
have
got
rid
of
all
the
and
everything
is
trim
and
tidy
the
fleas
have
disappeared
so
far
we
have
had
very
few
wounded
in
nearly
all
enteric
or
dysentery
with
some
cases
of
camp
fever
rheumatism
the
medical
officers
are
disappointed
at
so
little
surgical
work
but
i
do
think
i
mind
as
we
can
feel
we
are
actually
saving
the
lives
of
some
of
these
men
by
sheer
hard
nursing
and
that
is
good
enough
for
me
sometimes
a
man
sees
that
i
am
worrying
about
a
patient
who
does
not
seem
to
be
improving
or
who
is
going
downhill
and
he
will
come
up
and
say
never
mind
sister
he
would
have
been
dead
long
ago
if
he
had
been
left
in
that
field
hospital
any
longer
you
have
given
the
chap
a
chance
it
is
grand
to
see
the
first
batch
of
men
who
came
to
us
so
desperately
ill
so
haggard
starved
dirty
and
miserable
getting
about
now
in
their
blue
suits
looking
so
clean
and
bright
though
still
very
thin
some
of
them
are
beginning
to
need
to
be
amused
and
the
knitting
wool
and
materials
for
worsted
work
that
i
brought
out
are
coming
in
very
useful
in
fact
they
will
soon
be
finished
but
the
durban
ladies
have
kindly
promised
to
send
me
more
several
of
the
men
were
making
worsted
belts
in
one
ward
the
other
day
and
a
big
scotchman
looked
in
and
asked
them
to
go
for
a
walk
but
they
refused
saying
they
were
busy
and
the
scotchman
was
heard
to
mutter
they
all
turned
blooming
milliners
lieutenant
the
giant
is
getting
on
very
well
and
he
was
always
saying
i
must
stay
and
amuse
him
or
else
give
him
some
toys
so
i
have
started
him
with
some
worsted
work
and
he
is
more
contented
and
as
fussy
about
my
providing
him
with
the
right
shades
of
wool
as
any
old
lady
the
lieutenant
in
the
next
bed
has
learnt
to
knit
and
major
the
ptomaine
poisoning
case
looks
surprised
at
their
babyishness
the
other
day
sister
was
going
to
have
a
day
off
and
these
boys
overhearing
her
instructions
about
themselves
made
up
some
poetry
on
the
subject
which
i
enclose
and
sister
wo
hear
the
last
of
it
for
some
time
we
have
a
service
in
the
wards
every
other
sunday
and
the
i
brought
out
are
most
useful
the
last
few
days
have
been
very
busy
and
very
sad
on
the
we
had
a
trainload
of
patients
two
officers
and
men
several
of
the
men
very
bad
i
was
up
most
of
the
first
night
helping
with
the
bad
cases
but
one
poor
fellow
died
the
next
day
he
was
never
conscious
after
he
got
here
that
day
also
sister
knocked
up
with
slight
fever
so
i
had
to
take
over
her
ward
and
there
were
several
bad
cases
in
it
the
orderlies
are
knocking
up
with
enteric
six
of
them
warded
and
i
have
hardly
liked
to
leave
them
at
night
as
several
of
them
are
inclined
to
be
delirious
and
try
to
get
out
of
bed
was
the
worst
but
he
did
not
seem
in
any
special
danger
till
last
wednesday
on
that
day
i
was
orderly
sister
for
the
afternoon
and
on
my
first
round
i
talked
to
them
all
and
he
seemed
much
as
usual
but
on
my
second
round
i
found
him
distinctly
worse
and
with
a
failing
pulse
i
called
his
doctor
and
we
tried
everything
possible
but
he
soon
became
unconscious
and
died
at
all
the
orderlies
are
dreadfully
cut
up
several
of
them
come
from
the
same
place
in
yorks
he
was
such
a
fine
strong
young
fellow
and
it
seems
only
the
other
day
that
he
was
acting
as
groom
and
put
me
up
on
the
black
pony
and
was
so
pleased
i
could
manage
him
he
was
a
butcher
by
trade
rough
in
his
ways
but
so
i
must
write
to
his
poor
mother
he
had
a
military
funeral
and
we
let
every
orderly
go
who
could
be
spared
the
clergyman
asked
me
if
the
men
would
like
to
have
a
hymn
in
church
so
we
sang
brief
life
is
here
our
portion
several
people
sent
wreaths
and
the
men
are
going
to
make
a
wooden
cross
this
was
the
first
death
amongst
our
staff
having
so
many
orderlies
ill
and
the
place
pretty
full
we
have
been
very
busy
and
many
of
the
men
have
had
to
do
shifts
every
two
or
three
days
that
is
to
say
their
usual
day
and
half
the
night
so
they
are
having
a
heavy
time
of
it
enclosure
sister
day
off
there
once
was
a
sister
called
baker
of
beds
she
an
excellent
maker
she
knows
temperatures
too
and
between
me
and
you
is
of
medicines
an
excellent
shaker
she
shows
each
man
vice
how
to
treat
it
and
warns
sister
how
to
meet
it
no
you
can
trust
but
show
t
a
crust
well
it
a
thousand
to
one
he
eat
it
she
dilates
on
the
treatment
we
need
all
our
habits
our
drinks
our
feed
i
repeat
t
does
realise
all
but
he
can
not
be
trusted
for
greed
n
however
is
wise
at
the
sight
of
eggs
hard
boiled
he
sighs
d
eschew
them
i
must
and
that
beautiful
crust
for
on
me
sister
baker
relies
you
may
ask
how
we
know
what
was
said
the
culprit
there
lying
in
bed
overheard
in
the
dark
the
whispered
remark
and
tears
of
hot
anger
he
shed
the
moral
is
not
far
to
seek
a
crust
perforates
you
when
weak
while
eavesdropping
at
night
is
really
not
right
for
it
apt
to
raise
anger
and
pique
apologies
to
the
xxxii
pinetown
natal
since
my
last
letter
we
have
had
a
good
many
changes
of
patients
some
being
sent
back
to
the
front
and
others
going
home
by
various
hospital
ships
it
is
so
nice
to
see
some
who
were
carried
in
desperately
ill
able
to
march
down
to
the
train
so
cheery
and
bright
and
tremendously
grateful
we
sent
thirty
home
by
the
last
month
and
were
just
hoping
to
have
time
to
breathe
and
to
get
the
sheets
and
blankets
washed
when
we
had
a
wire
to
tell
us
to
expect
more
so
we
had
a
scramble
to
get
the
beds
and
bedding
ready
for
them
and
they
nearly
filled
us
up
but
they
were
not
quite
such
a
lot
as
our
previous
batches
had
been
and
there
were
a
good
many
wounded
by
way
of
a
change
we
were
still
so
had
to
do
a
good
deal
of
sorting
of
patients
turning
some
wards
into
convalescent
wards
that
needed
only
occasional
visits
from
a
sister
and
no
night
orderlies
a
sergeant
patient
being
made
responsible
for
good
order
in
the
ward
several
of
the
orderlies
are
still
ill
the
man
has
had
a
relapse
and
will
not
be
fit
for
work
for
some
time
the
second
compounder
has
also
been
very
bad
with
typhoid
delirious
for
more
than
a
week
but
i
think
he
will
do
all
right
now
it
has
been
awkward
as
the
first
compounder
can
only
just
crawl
about
after
his
spell
of
illness
we
have
had
one
man
awfully
bad
with
double
pneumonia
after
a
stiff
turn
of
typhoid
then
he
got
a
bad
abscess
in
the
jaw
and
had
to
have
it
operated
on
for
some
days
his
temperature
hovered
between
and
but
now
he
is
doing
well
and
will
soon
be
sent
home
we
have
been
inspected
by
colonel
clery
who
unfortunately
came
on
the
day
on
which
we
had
those
men
in
and
before
we
had
got
them
all
washed
or
their
kit
put
away
but
he
was
very
pleasant
to
me
and
said
he
was
pleased
with
the
wards
and
the
looks
of
the
patients
bedding
we
have
also
had
several
other
distinguished
visitors
sir
john
furley
sir
william
stokes
and
major
baptie
of
the
who
won
his
at
colenso
we
have
all
been
very
sorry
to
hear
of
the
death
of
colonel
forrester
who
had
been
in
charge
of
the
princess
christian
hospital
train
and
had
been
here
several
times
bringing
us
patients
the
four
months
for
which
this
hospital
was
given
equipped
and
maintained
by
private
generosity
are
now
nearly
over
and
in
a
few
days
we
shall
have
become
a
government
hospital
we
shall
then
receive
our
pay
and
various
allowances
from
the
government
and
we
are
now
arranging
to
separate
the
mess
of
the
sisters
from
that
of
the
medical
officers
i
expect
it
will
be
difficult
to
keep
our
stores
separately
but
we
shall
wish
to
live
more
economically
than
they
do
for
the
present
we
have
decided
to
share
the
same
cook
an
indian
who
has
been
acting
as
our
dhobie
for
the
last
few
weeks
and
who
we
hear
is
a
good
cook
his
wife
will
continue
to
act
as
our
dhobie
she
is
such
a
pretty
little
thing
with
rings
in
her
nose
and
bangles
on
her
ankles
and
arms
i
quite
expected
to
be
superseded
by
an
army
sister
proper
when
the
hospital
was
handed
over
but
the
has
asked
me
to
carry
on
which
does
not
mean
the
same
in
the
army
as
it
does
in
cockney
land
the
other
day
poor
miss
arrived
she
had
started
from
england
as
soon
as
she
heard
her
brother
was
ill
here
meaning
to
nurse
him
and
i
think
i
told
you
he
died
here
our
first
death
amongst
the
officers
it
was
awfully
sad
for
her
i
was
frightfully
busy
the
day
she
came
but
felt
i
must
walk
over
to
the
cemetery
with
her
she
is
a
trained
nurse
and
we
should
have
been
very
glad
of
her
help
if
she
could
only
have
arrived
in
time
as
her
brother
was
delirious
for
so
long
and
we
had
to
take
turns
at
sitting
up
with
him
for
some
time
but
everything
that
could
possibly
be
done
for
him
was
done
they
do
seem
to
muddle
things
a
bit
in
the
last
few
weeks
we
have
had
new
sisters
sent
to
us
we
would
have
given
anything
for
a
few
of
them
a
couple
of
months
ago
but
now
there
is
much
less
fever
and
many
of
the
beds
are
filled
with
convalescents
we
had
no
rooms
for
so
many
sisters
so
had
to
put
up
tents
for
them
one
day
we
sent
off
a
batch
of
over
fifty
men
for
home
emptied
several
wards
putting
the
remaining
cases
into
other
wards
and
had
a
general
clean
up
the
same
day
we
had
a
wire
to
tell
us
to
expect
men
the
next
evening
so
we
had
a
scramble
to
get
the
linen
dry
and
everything
ready
for
them
they
proved
to
be
all
convalescents
and
they
came
down
thinking
they
were
going
straight
on
board
ship
for
home
and
of
course
were
rather
disgusted
at
being
stopped
here
the
next
day
having
got
them
all
settled
in
and
their
kit
stowed
away
we
had
a
wire
asking
us
to
send
sixty
men
down
to
durban
the
next
morning
for
home
so
again
there
was
a
great
bustle
and
inspection
and
the
lucky
sixty
having
been
selected
had
to
retrieve
their
kit
from
the
store
and
be
fitted
up
with
comforts
for
the
voyage
we
feel
sure
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
their
coming
here
at
all
and
that
they
ought
to
have
gone
straight
on
board
ship
of
course
it
gave
us
an
awful
lot
of
work
and
did
not
do
them
any
good
we
must
try
to
see
the
remaining
twelve
get
off
with
the
next
batch
the
other
day
fifteen
new
orderlies
came
men
of
the
imperial
bearer
company
chiefly
recruited
from
refugees
and
other
colonials
some
of
them
are
quite
old
and
bearded
and
there
was
much
puffing
over
their
march
up
from
the
station
it
is
so
funny
to
have
to
hurry
these
venerable
gents
round
the
wards
when
they
look
at
me
solemnly
through
their
specs
and
the
tommies
are
rather
inclined
to
humbug
them
some
of
our
original
john
men
will
have
to
leave
soon
as
their
time
is
up
and
we
are
letting
all
those
go
who
are
not
very
keen
on
the
work
but
unfortunately
some
of
the
keen
ones
want
to
go
too
i
am
sorry
to
lose
them
and
rather
blame
the
sisters
for
it
the
orderlies
have
been
awfully
nice
to
me
two
of
the
best
have
been
promoted
to
be
sergeants
one
who
has
been
chiefly
in
the
ward
he
is
a
railway
guard
at
home
has
been
splendidly
patient
with
them
all
and
the
other
is
the
man
who
has
been
in
charge
of
the
sanitary
work
and
managed
the
coolies
i
have
been
having
a
little
riding
lately
while
the
extra
sisters
have
been
here
and
all
the
sisters
in
turn
are
having
a
few
days
leave
one
day
some
people
asked
us
to
go
for
a
picnic
riding
so
we
collected
all
the
screws
we
could
and
making
a
party
of
twelve
we
rode
to
a
very
pretty
waterfall
about
nine
miles
from
here
and
they
had
arranged
for
tea
at
a
quaint
old
farmhouse
near
by
riding
back
by
moonlight
my
funeral
horse
was
so
keen
that
i
could
hardly
hold
him
so
i
was
riding
ahead
with
one
of
the
men
when
hearing
a
shout
we
hurried
back
and
found
the
senior
civil
surgeon
had
had
a
tumble
he
was
not
much
of
a
horseman
and
they
had
put
him
on
the
very
quietest
nag
but
it
had
stumbled
and
he
came
off
he
managed
to
ride
home
at
a
walk
though
he
was
unconscious
for
a
few
minutes
at
first
he
was
a
good
deal
shaken
and
had
to
keep
quiet
for
some
days
another
day
we
went
to
the
trappist
abbey
when
we
arrived
they
kept
us
waiting
some
time
in
a
room
and
then
a
meal
suddenly
appeared
poached
eggs
delicious
brown
bread
honey
fruit
tea
and
tamarind
wine
we
were
surprised
as
it
was
early
in
the
afternoon
but
we
felt
obliged
to
accept
it
and
it
was
all
very
good
though
i
shied
at
the
tamarind
wine
afterwards
they
showed
us
round
the
place
it
is
really
wonderful
what
these
trappists
do
for
the
natives
with
their
schools
shops
for
bootmaking
saddlery
tanning
ironmongery
printing
photography
but
whether
it
does
the
native
any
real
and
lasting
good
to
teach
him
all
these
things
is
quite
another
matter
everything
seems
to
be
running
more
smoothly
in
the
hospital
now
and
even
if
the
place
were
full
of
bad
cases
as
it
was
at
the
first
now
that
the
orderlies
are
getting
to
know
their
duties
we
feel
that
we
could
tackle
the
work
without
the
hopeless
sensation
of
being
unable
to
do
half
enough
for
everybody
we
are
very
lucky
in
our
major
he
is
very
keen
to
have
everything
well
done
and
one
can
always
go
to
consult
him
in
any
difficulty
xxxiii
pinetown
natal
we
are
now
a
military
hospital
instead
of
being
partly
civil
and
partly
military
everybody
had
talked
so
much
about
the
coming
of
red
tape
that
i
had
been
a
little
nervous
about
the
change
but
except
just
in
the
transition
stage
everything
has
gone
very
smoothly
and
when
everybody
gets
used
to
the
military
ways
i
think
it
will
be
all
right
personally
i
shall
have
much
less
worry
and
responsibility
for
we
now
have
a
of
the
and
i
shall
not
have
to
try
to
look
after
the
linen
and
other
stores
moreover
a
batch
of
indians
has
arrived
and
gone
into
camp
with
a
good
headman
and
they
will
do
all
the
washing
over
which
i
have
had
so
many
struggles
with
careless
kaffir
women
i
had
to
attend
a
big
function
down
in
durban
when
the
residents
presented
the
gentleman
who
gave
this
hospital
with
an
illuminated
address
there
were
many
speeches
and
much
butter
for
all
the
staff
i
was
presented
with
a
large
photograph
of
the
address
we
have
had
a
good
many
changes
in
the
staff
and
among
the
civil
surgeons
who
have
gone
home
is
the
only
one
of
us
who
understood
the
electric
light
plant
with
which
in
consequence
we
have
had
difficulties
i
hope
we
shall
soon
find
an
orderly
who
understands
it
as
when
the
light
fails
and
we
have
to
grope
about
with
candles
the
men
can
not
read
and
find
the
long
evenings
very
dull
i
hear
many
interesting
tales
when
i
go
about
trying
to
amuse
the
men
on
these
occasions
the
other
day
i
was
called
to
enjoy
a
joke
some
of
them
had
asked
an
irishman
whether
he
knew
what
strategy
meant
and
he
said
yes
it
means
like
this
sure
when
you
fired
your
last
cartridge
do
let
the
enemy
know
but
jest
kape
on
firing
all
the
same
i
do
know
whether
it
was
original
but
he
brought
it
out
as
though
it
was
i
have
had
a
few
days
of
slight
fever
since
i
wrote
last
and
i
took
a
couple
of
days
off
and
spent
them
at
umkomaas
with
some
friends
who
have
a
nice
cottage
down
there
it
is
the
most
perfect
little
seaside
place
i
have
ever
struck
such
jolly
woods
all
round
the
cottage
with
growth
and
lots
of
monkeys
in
the
trees
glorious
rocks
and
a
blue
sea
i
had
a
delightful
rest
and
came
back
much
better
but
of
course
found
various
muddles
to
face
and
they
always
make
one
wish
one
had
never
gone
the
worst
thing
i
had
to
straighten
out
was
a
complaint
from
a
medical
officer
about
a
sister
they
had
been
rubbing
each
other
the
wrong
way
for
some
time
and
of
course
i
thought
if
i
had
not
gone
away
i
might
have
kept
the
peace
however
as
the
complaint
was
a
definite
one
though
in
no
way
serious
and
was
also
i
had
to
move
her
to
a
less
important
ward
this
very
much
hurt
her
feelings
and
i
was
sorry
as
though
not
a
good
manager
she
is
very
good
to
the
patients
now
she
works
for
a
different
doctor
and
there
is
peace
in
the
camp
all
the
civil
surgeons
and
sisters
growl
at
the
new
military
rules
and
regulations
but
i
think
they
are
rather
inclined
to
make
mountains
out
of
they
can
really
get
all
they
want
if
they
set
about
it
in
the
proper
way
but
they
do
take
the
trouble
to
find
out
what
the
proper
way
perhaps
i
have
rather
spoilt
the
sisters
by
letting
them
have
things
that
were
urgently
ordered
from
my
stores
at
any
time
but
now
that
the
place
is
not
so
crowded
up
with
bad
cases
they
must
learn
to
order
in
the
proper
way
and
at
the
proper
time
in
one
respect
i
was
afraid
that
our
system
would
be
changed
but
the
major
has
very
kindly
arranged
it
as
i
wished
i
saw
when
at
the
cape
and
heard
of
it
in
other
hospitals
that
when
a
sick
convoy
arrived
there
was
much
delay
before
the
men
were
classified
and
put
to
bed
sometimes
not
until
several
hours
after
their
arrival
one
cause
of
the
delay
was
that
each
man
if
he
could
crawl
had
to
go
up
to
the
store
to
draw
his
kit
and
sign
for
it
himself
the
poor
chaps
used
to
look
so
frightfully
ill
and
tired
with
this
weary
waiting
about
before
they
could
get
food
or
a
wash
after
perhaps
some
days
in
a
train
here
we
have
managed
quite
differently
as
soon
as
we
received
the
wire
saying
that
patients
were
coming
and
the
number
we
had
everything
issued
for
that
number
the
beds
were
all
made
up
and
before
they
arrived
i
used
to
go
round
and
see
that
the
crockery
for
each
man
was
on
his
locker
a
clean
shirt
towel
soap
and
flannel
all
ready
so
that
the
men
could
be
carried
straight
to
their
beds
as
soon
as
they
arrived
and
have
a
good
basin
of
bovril
without
any
delay
then
those
who
were
well
enough
to
go
up
to
the
store
to
give
in
their
kit
and
to
receive
their
hospital
suit
did
so
and
the
orderlies
took
up
the
kit
of
those
who
were
too
ill
of
course
they
did
not
want
hospital
suits
now
it
is
necessary
for
all
who
are
able
to
sign
for
their
equipment
sheets
blankets
but
the
major
lets
us
have
some
beds
fully
equipped
in
each
ward
before
the
men
arrive
and
the
orderlies
sign
for
those
fittings
until
the
men
arrive
and
then
they
countersign
the
book
so
that
the
bad
cases
can
still
be
carried
straight
to
their
beds
our
new
mess
arrangements
are
working
well
it
is
much
more
comfortable
having
a
cook
with
a
kitchen
separate
from
that
from
which
all
the
food
for
patients
orderlies
and
others
is
served
we
had
to
buy
a
new
stove
but
as
the
expense
was
shared
between
the
medical
officers
and
sisters
it
did
not
come
to
very
much
our
madrassee
cook
is
serving
us
very
well
i
thought
it
would
be
difficult
to
keep
our
stores
separate
but
he
seems
to
manage
well
and
economically
and
he
is
a
good
cook
and
serves
the
things
up
very
nicely
we
share
the
expense
of
his
wages
with
the
doctors
but
have
separate
boys
for
our
mess
waiters
and
for
our
rooms
i
have
kept
john
on
for
the
sisters
rooms
he
is
very
slow
but
a
good
old
thing
and
very
clean
it
is
the
custom
for
these
boys
to
go
home
for
a
day
or
two
when
their
wages
are
paid
but
you
always
keep
some
of
what
is
due
to
them
in
hand
or
they
do
come
back
but
when
the
hospital
was
handed
over
to
the
government
the
boys
were
all
paid
up
to
date
so
of
course
they
all
cleared
but
john
promised
to
come
back
in
two
days
and
i
thought
he
would
but
it
was
six
days
later
when
i
found
him
slinking
about
his
work
and
looking
like
a
big
dog
that
expected
a
whipping
i
said
oh
john
you
bad
boy
sisters
not
have
you
back
any
more
and
then
he
said
his
wife
was
plenty
sick
but
i
told
him
i
thought
kaffir
beer
was
plenty
good
at
which
he
grinned
and
i
had
to
forgive
him
william
our
good
scamp
of
a
boy
never
returned
so
i
had
to
go
into
durban
to
the
toct
or
tax
master
at
the
police
station
who
generally
looks
after
all
the
natives
and
gives
them
their
passes
i
chose
a
boy
who
was
recommended
but
he
never
turned
up
so
i
was
thinking
i
must
go
again
and
lead
one
out
from
durban
with
me
when
the
dearest
little
kaffir
turned
up
with
a
note
from
the
toct
master
saying
he
was
a
very
good
boy
and
his
name
was
imdenbe
son
of
cholem
chief
of
imsugelum
umtenta
so
i
was
rather
relieved
when
the
boy
said
his
name
was
dick
i
thought
he
was
much
too
small
to
reach
to
put
the
things
on
the
table
but
he
is
very
quick
and
nimble
and
clean
and
both
the
cook
and
john
are
very
fond
of
him
so
we
manage
all
right
and
he
looks
perfectly
sweet
in
his
white
suits
with
red
braid
they
all
wear
things
like
with
short
sleeves
and
go
about
barefoot
the
worst
of
the
enteric
season
seems
to
be
over
now
and
we
are
very
slack
and
we
hear
it
is
the
same
at
all
the
hospitals
up
this
side
the
days
are
still
very
hot
but
the
nights
are
quite
cold
i
expect
you
hear
more
about
this
hospital
commission
than
we
do
but
the
men
are
very
sick
about
it
as
they
have
worked
so
tremendously
hard
all
through
the
war
i
think
every
one
agrees
that
the
tommies
have
never
been
so
well
looked
after
in
any
war
before
but
no
doubt
at
the
front
they
have
suffered
badly
more
especially
at
bloemfontein
where
suddenly
the
army
was
attacked
by
a
perfect
scourge
of
enteric
i
believe
there
were
about
cases
there
but
people
must
remember
they
were
miles
from
their
base
with
only
a
single
line
of
rail
and
for
the
last
miles
almost
every
bridge
destroyed
so
that
all
traffic
had
to
be
carried
on
with
the
utmost
caution
over
temporary
bridges
only
a
few
trucks
crossing
at
a
time
also
it
was
an
unusually
dry
season
so
that
engines
often
had
to
drop
their
heavy
trains
run
on
to
get
water
and
then
return
for
them
the
transvaal
could
practically
supply
nothing
to
feed
the
troops
as
the
boers
had
planted
no
crops
to
get
sufficient
rations
up
daily
for
the
men
and
horses
was
just
about
all
the
one
rail
could
do
and
when
it
was
necessary
to
leave
the
railway
line
the
troops
often
had
to
wait
weeks
to
scrape
together
rations
to
carry
with
them
i
believe
the
were
well
prepared
for
the
probable
number
of
wounded
but
when
unexpected
sickness
knocked
the
men
over
by
the
thousand
it
is
scarcely
surprising
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
up
tents
and
all
medical
necessaries
and
comforts
quickly
enough
i
believe
the
sick
and
wounded
are
quite
comfortable
now
in
bloemfontein
but
no
doubt
there
was
suffering
there
and
the
commission
will
find
out
whether
it
might
have
been
prevented
there
can
have
been
little
excuse
for
the
bad
management
that
is
complained
of
at
the
base
and
if
that
is
proved
no
doubt
some
one
will
get
blamed
for
it
i
know
the
railway
on
this
side
that
passes
close
to
us
has
been
very
hard
worked
night
and
day
at
one
time
eight
trains
went
up
each
day
with
only
besides
almost
incessant
trainloads
of
men
horses
mules
stores
the
only
wonder
is
that
there
have
been
so
few
accidents
all
the
sisters
have
now
had
some
leave
and
as
we
have
extra
sisters
here
and
very
few
bad
cases
i
am
going
to
take
a
run
with
a
lady
from
here
and
hope
to
tell
you
about
that
next
time
i
write
xxxiv
pinetown
natal
i
must
first
of
all
tell
you
of
my
interesting
few
days
i
left
here
on
the
evening
of
the
of
last
month
with
and
her
baby
and
a
small
kaffir
nursemaid
she
was
going
to
stay
with
friends
who
have
a
hotel
and
store
at
colenso
and
i
had
engaged
a
bed
at
this
hotel
and
took
my
saddle
with
me
hoping
to
secure
a
horse
there
and
be
able
to
explore
the
country
around
two
of
our
medical
officers
were
going
for
a
run
the
same
day
but
as
the
train
ran
in
two
sections
i
only
saw
them
on
the
platform
at
maritzburg
late
that
evening
at
the
same
time
i
saw
another
officer
in
khaki
looking
at
me
and
then
recognised
in
him
a
london
surgeon
who
is
chief
of
another
hospital
out
here
of
course
i
was
more
used
to
seeing
him
in
frockcoat
and
he
had
his
wife
on
the
train
and
as
they
also
were
going
to
colenso
i
was
very
glad
to
be
able
to
be
with
them
there
the
train
rocked
about
so
much
first
crawling
up
a
hill
and
then
tearing
down
the
other
side
that
it
was
difficult
to
sleep
but
the
baby
slept
like
an
angel
with
the
little
kaffir
girl
safely
deposited
on
the
floor
at
the
next
morning
we
arrived
at
colenso
it
was
very
cold
and
very
dark
but
edwards
the
hotel
proprietor
met
us
and
with
him
we
stumbled
across
the
veldt
to
his
hotel
which
is
just
a
shanty
as
their
house
had
been
knocked
to
pieces
by
the
boers
unfortunately
he
could
not
possibly
take
in
my
friends
so
they
had
to
stay
at
the
station
i
was
very
glad
to
be
able
to
tumble
into
a
clean
bed
and
have
a
good
sleep
and
by
i
was
quite
fresh
again
then
i
was
annoyed
to
find
that
i
could
not
get
a
horse
as
they
were
all
engaged
and
i
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
ride
to
ladysmith
and
to
spion
kop
however
i
got
on
all
right
in
the
end
that
morning
we
climbed
hlangwane
hill
and
saw
some
really
wonderful
boer
trenches
you
absolutely
can
see
no
sign
of
them
in
broad
daylight
till
you
nearly
walk
into
them
then
we
saw
the
place
where
colonel
long
lost
his
guns
the
dead
cavalry
horses
are
still
lying
there
and
where
poor
young
lieutenant
roberts
was
mortally
wounded
in
trying
to
save
them
and
where
major
baptie
won
his
i
think
by
carrying
lieutenant
roberts
into
a
donga
and
staying
with
him
and
other
wounded
all
through
that
day
of
heavy
firing
trying
to
keep
them
comfortable
with
some
morphia
he
had
with
him
we
picked
up
as
many
pieces
of
shells
and
shrapnel
as
we
could
carry
and
walked
back
along
the
banks
of
the
tugela
i
heard
that
a
luggage
train
would
be
passing
at
so
i
thought
i
would
go
into
ladysmith
by
that
and
see
whether
there
was
any
chance
of
getting
out
to
spion
kop
from
there
there
are
very
few
passenger
trains
now
except
just
the
mails
so
we
are
allowed
to
travel
in
any
train
that
happens
to
stop
but
of
course
they
do
undertake
to
keep
to
any
particular
time
directly
after
lunch
i
strolled
down
to
the
station
no
or
any
official
there
but
i
met
a
gentleman
who
told
me
that
he
had
walked
all
the
way
out
from
ladysmith
and
was
expecting
to
have
to
wait
for
the
mail
train
to
take
him
back
so
he
was
very
glad
when
i
told
him
i
knew
the
next
goods
train
was
going
to
stop
there
he
said
his
wife
was
in
the
so
we
walked
along
to
find
her
and
soon
i
discovered
she
was
secretary
of
the
women
patriotic
league
in
durban
whom
i
had
not
actually
met
before
but
with
whom
i
had
had
much
pleasant
correspondence
as
they
had
been
very
kind
in
helping
us
so
we
trained
in
to
ladysmith
together
and
on
the
way
they
pointed
out
to
me
the
remains
of
the
great
dam
which
the
boers
made
to
try
to
flood
ladysmith
out
also
the
neutral
camp
of
intombi
there
is
no
hospital
there
now
only
the
cemetery
sadly
full
of
graves
they
told
me
they
were
staying
at
the
royal
and
that
people
from
there
frequently
drove
out
to
spion
kop
so
i
walked
up
with
them
and
interviewed
the
manageress
who
told
me
that
a
party
of
ladies
had
engaged
a
waggonette
to
drive
out
there
next
morning
and
she
thought
i
could
easily
secure
a
seat
eventually
i
met
these
ladies
and
found
they
were
durban
people
who
had
been
over
here
to
help
at
a
concert
for
our
men
so
they
were
very
kind
and
said
i
had
better
stay
the
night
as
they
had
to
start
early
in
the
morning
and
dine
with
them
i
went
out
and
wired
to
colenso
not
to
expect
me
back
bought
a
few
necessaries
and
then
took
a
look
round
the
town
the
hotel
i
was
staying
in
had
had
a
big
shell
right
through
which
had
killed
a
man
who
was
sitting
in
the
hall
and
the
town
hall
had
had
a
great
piece
knocked
off
the
tower
by
one
of
long
tom
shells
then
i
climbed
up
to
the
convent
which
was
used
at
first
as
quarters
but
had
been
tremendously
knocked
about
by
shells
the
kind
old
sisters
were
very
busy
with
workmen
patching
up
holes
in
the
walls
then
i
walked
out
to
the
cemetery
rather
a
long
walk
and
it
was
getting
dusk
so
i
could
not
stay
long
there
were
rows
and
rows
of
siege
graves
and
amongst
many
interesting
names
i
saw
those
of
the
earl
of
ava
and
poor
george
stevens
of
the
it
was
quite
dark
when
i
got
back
to
the
hotel
and
i
was
glad
of
dinner
and
not
sorry
to
go
early
to
bed
it
is
eighteen
miles
out
to
spion
kop
and
they
wo
send
a
carriage
there
for
less
than
but
for
that
sum
you
have
four
horses
and
six
people
can
go
in
the
carriage
i
had
told
the
manageress
that
i
would
gladly
pay
for
a
seat
but
in
the
end
i
was
not
allowed
to
pay
anything
as
there
were
only
four
besides
myself
and
they
had
already
arranged
to
pay
the
and
would
not
let
me
share
we
started
at
with
a
black
driver
and
a
small
white
boy
to
act
as
guide
many
of
the
horses
that
went
through
the
siege
have
not
yet
recovered
one
of
ours
was
taken
worse
on
the
way
and
we
had
to
wait
while
the
driver
crushed
up
a
nut
between
two
stones
and
thrust
it
down
the
horse
throat
then
it
struggled
on
till
we
reached
the
kraal
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
at
and
outspanned
on
the
way
we
passed
the
place
where
colonel
was
killed
we
had
a
bite
of
lunch
and
then
started
with
our
small
guide
up
the
thaba
inyama
one
peak
of
which
is
spion
kop
we
had
with
us
a
january
number
of
the
giving
a
full
account
of
day
so
we
were
able
to
trace
the
positions
and
i
had
heard
the
men
talk
so
much
about
it
i
felt
i
knew
my
way
quite
well
of
course
we
went
up
from
the
ladysmith
side
where
the
boers
were
but
from
the
top
we
could
look
over
to
potgieter
drift
and
camp
and
marvel
how
our
poor
chaps
ever
got
up
in
the
dark
with
the
boers
in
such
good
cover
above
them
and
to
be
ordered
back
must
have
been
frightfully
disappointing
we
saw
many
english
and
boer
graves
and
i
took
a
good
many
photos
including
one
of
the
cross
on
the
spot
where
general
woodgate
fell
we
picked
up
heaps
of
cartridges
full
and
empty
ones
emergency
ration
tins
soldiers
uniform
buttons
it
was
too
hard
climbing
to
burden
ourselves
with
any
shells
but
i
bought
a
few
from
kaffirs
who
had
gathered
near
our
carriage
i
am
collecting
a
very
varied
stock
of
ammunition
including
one
cartridge
they
were
burning
the
grass
down
all
round
the
base
of
the
hill
and
every
now
and
then
a
cartridge
went
off
we
hoped
the
fire
would
not
come
across
any
stray
shells
while
we
were
there
we
had
a
splendid
view
of
the
drakensberg
range
returning
to
our
carriage
we
had
lunch
with
an
admiring
crowd
of
rather
naked
kaffirs
around
who
seemed
much
to
appreciate
our
remains
and
we
started
for
the
return
drive
about
the
sick
horse
was
worse
on
the
way
back
and
had
to
have
several
doses
administered
as
we
were
nearing
ladysmith
i
found
we
were
passing
close
to
tin
town
hospital
so
thinking
it
was
a
pity
to
miss
seeing
the
place
i
left
the
carriage
and
walked
across
a
drift
on
the
klip
river
first
i
passed
some
officers
on
their
ponies
playing
at
heads
and
posts
then
i
came
to
the
horses
sick
camp
and
met
a
nice
old
veterinary
sergeant
who
i
found
was
a
colonial
who
came
from
kimberley
and
of
course
knew
people
whom
i
had
met
there
he
told
me
he
had
charge
of
sick
horses
but
many
of
them
were
convalescent
and
if
he
had
known
i
wanted
a
horse
he
would
gladly
have
lent
me
one
he
said
if
i
would
stay
another
day
or
two
i
could
send
down
for
my
saddle
and
he
would
lend
me
a
horse
and
a
mounted
orderly
so
that
i
could
ride
to
bulwana
waggon
hill
c√¶sar
camp
and
other
places
which
i
should
much
have
liked
to
visit
but
i
could
not
spare
the
time
then
he
took
me
along
to
the
sisters
huts
i
found
the
lady
superintendent
was
out
but
some
kindly
kilburn
sisters
gave
me
some
tea
and
took
me
round
the
hospital
not
many
cases
in
just
now
but
a
few
very
bad
enterics
the
sisters
told
me
that
as
the
red
cross
ambulance
drawn
by
eight
mules
was
going
into
ladysmith
i
could
drive
back
in
it
i
was
just
going
to
climb
inside
when
a
gentleman
in
khaki
came
and
asked
me
if
i
would
not
rather
ride
on
the
top
with
him
so
i
gladly
climbed
up
and
found
he
was
a
doctor
one
of
the
big
civilian
doctors
he
had
heard
who
i
was
and
amused
me
by
saying
he
wished
i
had
called
at
their
mess
fancy
shy
calling
at
an
unknown
officers
mess
instead
of
going
to
tea
with
those
estimable
females
as
they
would
have
shown
me
more
of
the
place
and
they
have
a
good
collection
of
curios
that
would
have
interested
me
he
was
looking
at
the
things
i
had
picked
up
it
was
a
very
jolly
drive
and
he
insisted
on
driving
me
right
up
to
my
hotel
i
must
really
tell
you
about
the
rest
of
my
travels
in
my
next
letter
i
was
away
only
five
days
but
you
will
see
that
i
squeezed
a
good
deal
into
those
days
xxxv
pinetown
natal
i
will
just
finish
telling
you
of
my
travels
while
they
are
fresh
in
my
memory
and
then
this
letter
can
wait
till
there
is
enough
material
to
fill
it
up
i
was
very
sorry
to
hear
from
my
friend
on
the
ambulance
of
the
death
of
sir
william
stokes
physician
he
was
ill
only
four
days
and
it
seems
only
the
other
day
he
came
round
this
hospital
and
was
so
cheery
and
bright
and
i
know
he
was
meaning
to
say
a
good
deal
to
the
hospital
commission
in
favour
of
the
hospitals
out
here
and
of
the
work
they
have
done
i
just
had
dinner
with
my
friends
at
the
royal
and
then
the
took
me
to
the
station
with
my
heavy
bag
of
shells
in
time
for
the
train
back
to
colenso
i
was
awfully
tired
but
the
mosquitoes
were
bad
and
did
not
let
me
have
much
sleep
the
next
day
i
was
invited
to
go
with
a
picnic
party
to
the
tugela
falls
a
large
ox
waggon
was
loaded
up
with
children
provisions
and
i
went
with
some
more
people
in
an
army
service
corps
scotch
cart
with
no
springs
drawn
by
four
mules
who
frequently
ran
away
and
who
seemed
to
have
a
rooted
objection
to
keeping
to
the
road
or
rather
track
so
the
journey
was
rather
perilous
and
distinctly
painful
we
passed
fort
wylie
and
saw
where
all
the
fighting
took
place
on
pieter
hill
and
we
saw
the
rough
bridge
that
the
boers
had
made
over
the
tugela
by
simply
pulling
up
our
rails
with
the
sleepers
attached
and
throwing
them
into
the
river
we
had
lunch
close
by
the
falls
even
after
this
very
dry
season
it
is
quite
a
big
fall
and
after
lunch
we
climbed
the
hills
around
including
hart
hill
on
the
top
of
this
hill
is
a
big
memorial
stone
to
colonel
thackery
several
more
officers
and
men
of
the
inniskillings
who
fell
up
there
and
we
also
saw
their
grave
fenced
in
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
by
the
time
that
we
got
down
to
the
line
again
it
was
blowing
a
gale
and
dust
so
some
of
us
sheltered
in
a
platelayer
cottage
he
had
a
fine
collection
of
shells
and
other
relics
his
cottage
had
been
used
by
the
boers
as
a
telegraph
station
and
we
found
he
had
been
in
the
of
the
armoured
train
when
winston
churchill
was
taken
prisoner
as
had
her
baby
with
her
and
it
was
now
a
really
bad
this
man
kindly
stopped
a
goods
train
with
his
red
flag
and
we
returned
comfortably
to
colenso
in
the
guard
van
i
should
much
like
to
have
had
longer
stay
both
at
colenso
and
ladysmith
there
was
so
much
of
interest
both
in
the
places
and
in
the
people
one
met
but
i
wanted
to
visit
a
few
places
on
the
way
down
so
i
left
colenso
the
next
morning
at
my
first
stop
was
at
chieveley
where
there
had
been
a
big
hospital
but
all
that
remains
now
is
a
little
graveyard
with
nearly
two
hundred
graves
many
died
from
wounds
but
many
more
from
enteric
they
had
a
clever
way
of
marking
the
graves
each
man
name
regiment
being
written
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
enclosed
in
a
medicine
bottle
and
securely
stuck
into
the
mound
i
saw
poor
lieutenant
roberts
grave
it
has
a
plain
stone
with
an
inscription
but
i
hear
a
cross
is
being
sent
out
they
had
brought
him
from
colenso
on
the
ambulance
train
the
evening
of
the
day
he
was
wounded
the
told
me
he
had
helped
to
lift
him
out
of
the
train
and
he
seemed
sensible
and
comfortable
then
but
he
died
the
same
night
i
saw
a
very
fine
redoubt
at
chieveley
made
by
the
royal
engineers
but
it
was
never
used
i
took
the
next
train
on
to
mooi
river
before
we
reached
frere
station
we
passed
the
place
of
the
armoured
train
disaster
and
the
graves
of
the
royal
dublin
fusiliers
who
fell
there
wherever
you
go
there
seem
to
be
graves
dotted
about
most
of
them
enclosed
with
barbed
wire
and
some
with
a
cross
set
up
or
the
initials
marked
out
in
empty
there
is
a
large
hospital
at
estcourt
but
i
had
only
time
for
a
hasty
lunch
at
the
station
there
as
i
wanted
to
have
an
hour
or
two
at
mooi
river
to
see
the
hospital
where
i
knew
one
of
the
doctors
and
where
it
seemed
probable
that
we
should
be
sent
when
we
first
arrived
on
the
whole
i
am
glad
we
were
stationed
there
though
they
have
had
more
interesting
surgical
work
than
we
have
unfortunately
my
friend
was
away
but
the
superintendent
kindly
showed
me
round
and
i
had
tea
in
the
sisters
mess
they
have
beds
nearly
all
under
canvas
it
was
blowing
hard
and
while
i
was
there
it
began
to
rain
and
it
was
snowing
on
the
drakensberg
and
very
cold
so
every
one
looked
rather
miserable
it
is
a
desolate
place
on
the
bare
veldt
i
left
again
on
a
goods
train
at
and
rattled
down
to
maritzburg
by
where
i
meant
to
stay
the
night
miss
kindly
met
me
at
the
station
and
we
drove
down
to
her
house
in
a
riksha
she
has
been
taking
in
convalescent
nurses
and
feeding
them
and
giving
them
a
rest
she
has
had
much
anxiety
about
her
brothers
one
of
whom
was
commandeered
and
had
to
fight
for
the
boers
together
with
his
son
a
boy
of
sixteen
they
were
with
cronje
at
paardeberg
and
are
now
prisoners
at
helena
another
brother
was
fighting
for
us
and
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
boers
but
released
when
we
took
pretoria
miss
wanted
me
to
go
out
to
howick
to
see
the
falls
there
and
to
have
a
look
at
the
big
convalescent
camp
where
they
have
beds
but
the
train
left
earlier
than
she
thought
so
i
missed
it
and
instead
she
took
me
to
see
the
maritzburg
hospitals
fort
napier
grey
hospital
now
civilian
again
and
the
garrison
church
the
last
the
most
comfortable
looking
hospital
i
have
seen
further
than
this
one
but
it
was
a
little
strange
to
see
the
men
in
their
hospital
suits
lounging
and
smoking
on
the
church
steps
i
met
a
sister
whom
i
had
known
in
london
she
was
excited
about
playing
in
a
cricket
match
and
as
she
and
all
the
eleven
sisters
had
been
given
a
week
leave
from
duty
to
practise
for
this
cricket
match
they
are
evidently
as
slack
in
the
way
of
work
as
we
are
i
had
some
nice
greetings
from
some
old
patients
of
ours
now
on
duty
in
maritzburg
i
left
there
about
had
dinner
at
inchanga
with
a
correspondent
and
got
back
here
about
some
orderlies
were
at
the
station
and
kindly
carried
up
my
load
of
curios
the
two
medical
officers
had
got
back
the
night
before
and
though
they
went
as
far
up
as
newcastle
they
had
not
seen
as
much
as
i
had
and
regretted
that
they
had
not
had
my
offer
of
a
convalescent
horse
at
ladysmith
i
have
seen
a
good
many
hospitals
and
met
a
good
many
sisters
and
i
have
gathered
a
few
hints
of
little
ways
in
which
we
might
improve
this
hospital
but
though
i
says
it
as
should
i
do
think
there
is
any
hospital
up
this
side
where
the
men
are
more
comfortable
and
happy
and
i
think
the
sisters
here
are
better
fed
and
their
mess
bills
are
no
higher
than
at
any
of
the
hospitals
indeed
lower
than
most
of
them
i
was
glad
to
find
that
they
had
had
a
peaceful
time
while
i
was
away
and
no
difficulties
and
as
there
are
actually
only
eighteen
men
and
ten
officers
in
we
are
still
very
slack
we
expect
some
more
any
day
now
but
there
is
very
little
sickness
just
at
present
you
ask
about
the
men
and
their
letters
it
was
rather
difficult
when
we
were
so
frightfully
busy
at
first
to
do
all
that
one
would
have
liked
but
we
always
try
to
write
for
the
men
who
are
too
ill
to
write
for
themselves
and
i
always
saw
that
all
the
men
who
wished
had
writing
materials
and
they
used
to
help
each
other
they
say
at
some
of
the
base
hospitals
stray
lady
visitors
have
been
such
a
nuisance
in
interfering
with
the
nurses
but
i
could
well
and
safely
have
employed
a
few
stray
ladies
in
amusing
the
men
writing
their
letters
for
them
the
friends
of
those
officers
who
were
dangerously
ill
were
all
written
to
by
each
mail
now
that
we
are
slack
of
course
i
have
much
more
chance
of
talking
to
the
men
and
they
tell
me
many
tales
of
the
fighting
and
of
the
rough
time
they
have
had
at
the
front
but
you
will
hear
plenty
of
that
from
the
men
who
have
gone
home
i
am
beginning
to
have
many
grateful
letters
from
our
patients
friends
at
home
there
has
been
some
delay
about
our
pay
lately
and
some
of
the
sisters
who
were
lodging
here
had
not
received
any
since
they
left
england
so
were
not
able
to
pay
their
mess
bills
and
i
had
to
pay
various
mess
accounts
when
i
got
back
from
my
run
and
began
to
feel
rather
anxious
as
to
whether
i
could
go
on
feeding
my
large
party
of
sisters
but
now
the
pay
has
turned
up
so
we
have
got
straight
again
and
the
government
give
us
various
allowances
colonial
allowance
and
for
mess
servants
fuel
so
we
are
feeling
rather
well
off
we
are
much
enjoying
a
big
package
of
papers
that
the
red
cross
society
now
send
up
to
us
each
week
whole
weeks
of
london
and
they
are
the
greatest
boon
to
the
whole
camp
the
men
point
out
to
me
the
pretty
boys
in
the
illustrated
papers
when
they
see
any
pictures
of
soldiers
as
by
comparison
they
all
look
so
thin
and
rough
out
here
xxxvi
pinetown
natal
now
we
are
really
getting
busy
again
patients
keep
arriving
sometimes
small
parties
sometimes
large
early
in
september
we
admitted
thirteen
men
who
had
been
prisoners
in
pretoria
for
nine
months
they
were
very
weak
and
run
down
and
so
happy
to
be
here
when
i
took
them
their
first
basket
of
fruit
they
simply
wolfed
it
down
as
they
had
seen
no
fruit
since
they
went
then
we
had
rather
a
difficult
batch
of
officers
sent
down
from
mooi
river
they
have
no
officers
wards
there
so
these
men
had
been
quartered
in
a
hotel
more
than
a
mile
from
the
hospital
where
each
had
his
own
room
and
servant
and
they
seem
to
have
ordered
and
done
just
what
they
liked
up
to
now
we
have
never
had
more
than
three
or
four
officers
well
enough
to
sit
up
to
meals
at
one
time
as
they
have
always
come
to
us
really
ill
and
as
soon
as
they
were
well
enough
they
have
either
rushed
back
to
the
front
or
have
been
sent
home
on
the
hospital
ships
but
with
these
officers
from
mooi
river
none
of
them
very
ill
i
suddenly
found
that
we
had
sick
officers
in
and
that
of
them
were
well
enough
to
sit
up
to
meals
and
that
it
was
not
suitable
for
them
to
eat
in
the
ward
where
there
were
a
few
men
still
very
ill
so
eventually
a
large
tent
had
to
be
rigged
up
for
them
and
as
it
was
a
long
way
from
the
kitchen
there
was
some
difficulty
in
getting
the
food
to
them
hot
the
medical
officer
was
a
civilian
and
he
did
not
seem
to
think
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
responsibility
about
feeding
these
hungry
convalescent
officers
in
fact
every
one
seemed
rather
inclined
to
say
it
is
my
work
and
our
john
men
are
not
like
men
who
may
be
accustomed
to
turning
to
as
mess
waiters
on
occasion
neither
was
the
cook
quite
ready
to
serve
up
a
dinner
of
several
courses
instead
of
single
diets
for
each
patient
i
am
afraid
i
had
to
worry
the
poor
but
i
knew
if
i
did
not
do
so
the
officers
would
complain
they
could
not
get
anything
to
eat
and
after
wrestling
through
the
first
night
dinner
when
i
found
orderlies
running
down
with
the
fish
before
the
soup
and
some
vegetables
after
the
sweets
had
been
served
we
laid
plans
for
better
management
and
for
a
day
or
two
the
major
went
to
the
kitchen
and
saw
the
food
sent
down
in
proper
order
and
i
received
it
and
saw
it
served
in
the
tent
and
four
of
the
officers
servants
were
told
off
to
wait
each
night
and
the
orderlies
had
only
to
carry
the
food
down
for
them
so
now
that
is
running
all
right
and
i
only
just
have
to
look
in
to
see
they
have
all
they
want
for
some
time
we
have
been
expecting
to
be
inspected
by
the
hospital
commission
but
at
last
we
heard
they
were
not
coming
here
at
all
as
there
had
been
no
complaints
about
this
hospital
so
i
should
have
been
very
vexed
if
our
record
had
been
spoilt
at
this
late
stage
of
the
war
our
next
order
was
to
prepare
for
a
train
that
was
bringing
us
seven
officers
and
men
from
pretoria
the
biggest
trainload
we
have
yet
received
having
had
sisters
here
over
our
correct
number
for
some
time
and
very
little
for
them
to
do
of
course
as
soon
as
we
got
busy
we
kept
having
wires
to
send
one
sister
for
duty
on
the
hospital
ship
or
two
sisters
to
the
hospital
ship
and
so
on
and
none
of
them
wanted
to
go
so
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
sort
them
in
fact
there
have
been
so
many
orders
and
counter
orders
that
i
should
never
be
surprised
if
i
had
a
wire
telling
me
to
go
off
on
a
hospital
ship
or
if
we
had
orders
to
pack
up
the
whole
hospital
and
take
it
up
to
pretoria
before
left
he
let
us
buy
some
remaining
groceries
at
home
prices
a
great
saving
for
our
mess
and
after
we
found
a
small
storeroom
to
arrange
them
in
i
rather
foolishly
let
them
use
the
cases
for
firewood
which
has
been
very
scarce
here
so
if
we
have
to
move
all
the
sisters
intend
to
sling
bottles
of
fruit
and
tins
of
jam
sardines
round
them
as
we
really
ca
leave
our
stores
behind
i
hear
that
the
army
sisters
on
the
hospital
ships
are
rather
horrified
that
i
am
still
left
in
charge
here
now
that
it
is
a
military
hospital
and
that
there
are
plenty
of
army
sisters
out
in
the
country
but
the
has
been
very
nice
to
me
and
i
am
very
glad
to
carry
on
as
long
as
they
want
me
the
only
thing
is
that
i
should
very
much
have
liked
to
see
a
little
of
the
work
nearer
up
to
the
front
and
as
it
seems
probable
that
this
place
will
become
later
on
a
sort
of
convalescent
home
the
work
will
not
be
so
interesting
yesterday
some
officers
went
down
to
durban
and
came
back
much
excited
by
rumours
that
the
line
and
the
wire
had
been
cut
at
standerton
that
boer
prisoners
had
been
released
that
johannesburg
was
surrounded
and
a
few
more
exciting
items
but
i
dare
say
they
are
not
true
i
never
pretend
to
tell
you
about
the
war
by
degrees
we
are
getting
a
few
orderlies
and
officers
and
of
course
they
make
the
work
easier
for
us
but
we
are
quite
proud
of
some
of
the
john
men
who
are
becoming
excellent
and
most
efficient
nurses
and
they
really
knew
nothing
of
nursing
six
months
ago
i
had
a
great
triumph
when
the
big
batch
of
men
arrived
as
everything
had
been
issued
for
them
the
day
before
and
signed
for
by
the
orderlies
and
after
they
arrived
every
man
was
either
comfortably
in
bed
or
had
had
a
preliminary
wash
and
was
ready
to
sit
down
to
a
good
meal
and
after
that
he
went
up
to
the
store
to
hand
in
his
kit
some
of
the
patients
and
some
of
the
men
told
me
that
in
many
of
the
military
hospitals
it
would
have
taken
four
or
five
hours
to
get
so
many
of
them
settled
and
fed
there
are
several
very
bad
cases
amongst
them
but
also
a
good
many
convalescents
we
have
two
officers
desperately
ill
one
a
major
in
the
who
i
fear
is
not
likely
to
get
better
though
they
are
trying
everything
possible
for
him
and
the
other
is
a
lieutenant
in
the
rifle
brigade
who
has
been
delirious
for
a
long
time
enteric
and
very
ill
but
i
fancy
he
will
pull
round
i
have
been
able
to
give
him
special
nurses
when
necessary
also
we
have
a
bad
case
of
enteric
in
the
men
ward
i
do
think
i
have
ever
seen
a
case
where
there
has
been
so
much
h√¶morrhage
and
yet
i
think
he
will
pull
round
though
he
is
nearly
a
skeleton
and
even
i
can
easily
lift
him
up
while
his
sheet
is
changed
i
have
been
much
pleased
at
the
really
tender
way
the
orderlies
have
nursed
this
boy
as
he
has
needed
a
great
deal
of
patience
we
are
getting
quite
keen
on
our
gardens
now
that
we
have
a
little
more
time
to
breathe
but
whenever
i
plant
anything
i
wonder
whether
by
any
chance
i
shall
be
here
to
see
it
grow
up
i
now
have
some
healthy
violets
and
some
geraniums
some
time
ago
i
had
two
beautiful
orpington
hens
and
a
cock
given
to
me
they
lay
splendidly
and
the
eggs
have
been
very
useful
but
they
showed
no
sign
of
wishing
to
sit
so
i
got
a
friend
to
put
some
of
my
eggs
under
a
broody
hen
and
hope
soon
to
have
some
young
orpingtons
the
men
have
not
had
time
to
make
me
a
henhouse
yet
so
we
have
to
keep
a
sharp
to
secure
the
eggs
and
our
small
dick
is
very
attentive
to
them
i
went
into
durban
the
other
day
to
do
some
shopping
for
the
mess
and
saw
some
friends
and
then
i
went
down
to
the
jetty
to
see
some
of
our
orderlies
and
patients
a
nice
lot
of
men
of
the
coldstreams
and
other
regiments
many
of
them
wounded
from
pretoria
who
were
going
home
on
the
i
met
a
sister
whom
i
knew
and
one
of
our
medical
officers
was
seeing
the
men
on
board
and
one
of
the
embarkation
people
invited
us
to
go
out
in
the
tender
to
the
at
the
outer
anchorage
so
we
had
a
nice
little
sea
breeze
and
the
officers
on
board
gave
us
tea
and
offered
to
show
us
our
cabins
so
we
had
a
good
chance
to
stow
away
for
home
six
of
our
orderlies
were
going
home
on
duty
and
they
all
came
to
say
and
we
had
quite
a
send
off
from
them
and
the
old
patients
when
we
left
the
ship
some
people
have
been
giving
a
picnic
at
a
pretty
place
called
krantz
kloof
they
invited
all
we
could
spare
to
join
them
so
i
let
six
sisters
go
and
four
of
the
medical
officers
and
four
convalescent
officers
also
went
off
with
them
in
an
ox
waggon
at
and
they
did
not
get
back
till
i
have
been
busy
all
day
keeping
an
eye
on
the
place
generally
to
see
that
nothing
was
neglected
while
so
many
were
away
the
night
sister
and
night
special
both
went
so
i
have
now
sent
them
to
bed
for
a
few
hours
and
i
have
been
writing
beside
lieutenant
of
the
rifle
brigade
but
i
am
sure
he
is
better
and
he
is
inclined
to
sleep
every
now
and
then
i
let
the
orderly
sit
by
him
while
i
take
a
prowl
round
to
see
the
other
wards
are
all
right
now
it
is
so
i
shall
call
the
two
sisters
and
turn
in
and
i
need
not
hurry
up
in
the
morning
unless
there
are
any
fresh
orders
to
attend
to
xxxvii
pinetown
natal
we
have
had
a
good
deal
of
rain
lately
and
the
country
is
looking
lovely
again
you
can
almost
see
the
things
growing
in
the
garden
sometimes
it
rains
for
three
days
without
stopping
and
south
africa
without
the
sun
always
looks
very
gloomy
but
when
the
sun
comes
out
again
it
makes
up
for
the
gloominess
it
has
begun
to
get
very
hot
rather
earlier
than
usual
and
the
thermometer
showed
in
the
shade
the
other
day
last
month
we
took
in
fifty
more
men
who
had
been
prisoners
with
the
boers
a
good
many
of
them
were
gentlemen
troopers
of
the
yeomanry
they
were
sent
here
delagoa
bay
one
of
them
brought
a
parrot
and
there
were
several
small
birds
as
well
then
the
other
day
we
took
in
eighty
men
from
charlestown
nearly
all
convalescents
and
such
a
mixed
lot
of
regiments
scotch
irish
australians
new
zealanders
and
tasmanians
and
one
little
australian
bugler
aged
fifteen
whom
all
the
men
spoil
the
poor
major
of
the
who
i
told
you
was
so
ill
died
in
the
early
part
of
this
month
it
was
very
sad
as
he
knew
so
well
what
all
the
bad
symptoms
meant
as
they
appeared
i
think
i
told
you
also
of
lieutenant
who
was
desperately
ill
for
so
long
we
had
a
very
anxious
time
with
him
as
the
delirium
went
on
for
so
long
that
we
began
to
fear
it
would
become
permanent
but
at
last
he
pulled
round
and
has
been
such
a
nice
patient
we
have
very
few
officers
in
now
the
natal
volunteers
were
expected
to
return
to
durban
on
october
they
have
been
a
year
at
the
front
but
the
boers
attacked
a
convoy
near
dundee
and
they
were
all
ordered
back
durban
was
preparing
a
great
welcome
for
them
and
the
meat
for
the
big
lunch
that
the
mayor
was
going
to
give
them
was
actually
cooked
they
got
home
about
a
week
later
and
we
all
went
down
to
the
station
to
see
them
pass
many
of
our
old
patients
amongst
them
i
had
the
bad
luck
to
have
a
nasty
fall
out
riding
early
in
the
month
and
am
only
beginning
to
crawl
about
again
with
a
good
deal
of
pain
from
a
damaged
kidney
one
of
the
medical
officers
was
ill
and
had
asked
me
to
exercise
his
pony
any
time
i
liked
to
use
it
he
did
like
the
kaffir
boy
taking
it
out
so
when
the
major
and
another
man
asked
me
to
go
with
them
to
pay
a
few
calls
on
people
who
have
been
very
kind
to
us
here
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
chance
to
exercise
the
pony
from
here
down
to
the
station
is
a
good
bit
of
soft
sand
and
all
the
ponies
were
fresh
so
we
let
them
scatter
along
then
i
saw
there
was
a
train
shunting
at
the
level
crossing
so
i
wanted
to
pull
up
before
we
got
mixed
up
on
the
line
of
course
no
gates
here
and
just
then
one
of
the
men
lost
his
hat
my
pony
got
cross
at
being
checked
and
bucked
a
bit
and
then
suddenly
swung
round
and
jumped
a
fallen
tree
and
off
i
went
on
the
wrong
side
falling
across
a
branch
of
the
tree
i
think
why
i
fell
except
that
i
was
so
sure
i
could
not
come
off
i
never
thought
about
sticking
on
and
was
preparing
to
give
him
a
licking
for
being
so
stupid
i
did
not
feel
much
damaged
at
the
time
though
i
thought
i
should
have
a
big
bruise
just
above
my
hip
and
when
they
had
caught
my
pony
i
remounted
and
we
went
on
again
luckily
most
of
the
people
were
out
but
at
one
place
i
had
to
get
off
and
when
it
came
to
remounting
i
simply
could
not
spring
and
had
to
condescend
to
mount
from
a
chair
and
when
i
got
home
i
felt
really
bad
and
had
to
go
to
bed
fortunately
there
were
plenty
of
sisters
to
do
the
work
and
things
went
on
all
right
while
i
was
laid
up
and
now
i
can
get
about
enough
to
do
the
housekeeping
and
hope
soon
to
get
round
the
wards
again
but
they
are
very
quiet
at
present
we
have
rather
amusing
tiffs
between
the
officers
and
sisters
mess
just
now
potatoes
are
very
scarce
as
the
military
people
have
bought
them
all
up
i
found
the
cook
was
using
mine
for
the
officers
as
they
had
run
out
so
i
told
them
i
had
had
to
pay
for
a
bag
but
i
should
charge
them
more
by
the
pound
they
thought
i
had
paid
too
much
and
asked
the
who
was
going
into
durban
to
bring
them
out
a
bag
when
he
came
back
he
had
to
confess
that
he
had
had
to
give
for
a
bag
and
it
never
turned
up
at
the
station
and
he
had
no
receipt
and
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
shop
we
are
constantly
having
to
make
little
exchanges
of
food
but
it
is
necessary
to
keep
a
very
sharp
eye
on
our
supplies
our
nice
little
imp
dick
otherwise
imdenbe
son
of
cholem
chief
of
imsugelum
umtenta
got
and
wanted
to
go
home
to
his
mother
so
now
we
have
another
boy
for
the
i
dare
say
dick
will
come
slinking
back
when
he
has
spent
his
money
john
the
big
is
still
here
and
is
an
excellent
servant
when
we
first
came
let
him
take
care
of
his
horse
of
course
paying
him
extra
but
then
when
other
medical
officers
also
got
horses
the
major
said
that
one
boy
must
look
after
them
all
as
there
were
difficulties
about
fodder
but
when
told
john
he
said
no
sir
me
never
give
up
tommy
tommy
he
clean
he
fat
he
happy
and
john
love
him
john
cry
very
much
if
boss
give
tommy
one
new
boy
but
poor
john
had
to
give
him
up
and
i
believe
he
cry
in
my
room
i
have
the
luxury
of
a
big
wardrobe
with
glass
doors
and
john
takes
great
pride
in
this
piece
of
furniture
i
believe
he
loves
to
see
himself
in
the
mirror
one
day
i
found
he
had
turned
my
dresses
out
to
dust
inside
i
expected
him
to
proceed
to
tidy
the
drawers
next
but
i
drew
the
line
there
he
keeps
our
rooms
beautifully
clean
and
is
absolutely
honest
the
other
day
he
knocked
at
one
of
the
sister
doors
when
she
was
having
a
bath
and
when
she
told
him
he
could
not
come
in
he
said
it
only
me
old
john
and
was
quite
hurt
that
she
would
not
unlock
the
door
i
think
i
told
you
about
his
going
home
after
payday
and
stopping
too
long
the
same
thing
happened
again
the
other
day
and
when
he
came
slinking
round
with
his
broom
and
pail
again
looking
as
though
he
expected
me
to
hit
him
i
said
oh
john
i
just
going
to
toctmaster
for
another
boy
and
he
said
no
missus
me
never
leave
the
sisters
but
my
wife
very
sick
and
it
rain
very
much
and
kaffir
beer
very
good
at
my
kraal
so
i
had
to
forgive
him
as
he
was
honest
about
it
we
have
had
a
good
many
changes
amongst
the
sisters
lately
but
at
present
they
seem
a
happy
lot
and
they
work
well
they
have
been
much
more
contented
since
they
took
their
few
days
as
it
has
made
them
realise
that
in
most
ways
they
are
better
off
here
as
the
summer
comes
on
the
creeping
and
crawling
beasts
are
getting
very
objectionable
amongst
others
that
come
into
my
room
are
grasshoppers
locusts
flying
beetles
huge
brutes
and
mosquitoes
when
they
get
very
numerous
i
have
to
turn
my
light
off
and
wait
till
i
hear
them
all
make
for
the
electric
light
outside
there
are
six
cats
about
the
place
and
two
of
them
insist
on
sleeping
in
my
room
of
course
my
door
and
window
are
always
open
one
always
sleeps
on
my
chest
of
drawers
and
the
other
on
the
clothes
basket
so
i
feel
safe
that
snakes
wo
come
in
as
a
cat
always
lets
you
know
when
one
is
about
one
night
the
small
tabby
brought
the
most
extraordinary
creature
into
my
room
it
was
like
a
small
crab
and
it
ran
round
and
round
in
a
circle
and
squeaked
like
one
of
those
mice
the
other
day
it
began
to
rain
and
then
we
were
afflicted
by
a
perfect
scourge
of
flying
ants
which
i
had
never
seen
before
in
such
numbers
they
covered
the
walls
of
our
rooms
and
some
of
the
sisters
could
eat
no
dinner
as
they
were
so
thick
on
the
table
the
men
in
the
wards
swept
them
up
in
bucketfuls
then
in
a
couple
of
hours
they
all
took
themselves
off
again
without
any
apparent
method
in
their
madness
we
have
all
sorts
of
vegetables
and
flowers
coming
on
in
the
garden
the
rainy
weather
suiting
them
well
but
the
wet
days
are
rather
dull
for
the
men
and
there
seems
to
be
more
sickness
starting
again
i
had
a
letter
from
the
other
day
from
kroonstad
saying
that
he
was
fit
and
well
but
heartily
sick
of
trekking
about
the
free
state
really
the
men
seem
so
tired
of
the
war
just
now
it
is
all
very
well
to
put
up
with
hardships
and
short
rations
for
a
few
months
but
when
it
runs
on
to
a
year
every
one
has
had
enough
the
other
day
we
had
a
wire
to
ask
for
a
doctor
to
go
to
an
officer
who
had
been
taken
ill
when
on
leave
about
an
hour
up
the
line
from
here
went
to
see
him
and
found
him
rather
bad
so
the
next
day
a
went
up
and
brought
him
here
we
have
several
rather
bad
cases
in
just
now
but
we
have
plenty
of
people
to
look
after
them
and
there
is
none
of
the
anxiety
we
had
at
first
when
we
were
overwhelmed
with
enteric
cases
and
the
orderlies
were
so
helpless
we
hear
that
lord
roberts
is
coming
down
this
way
soon
but
there
are
so
many
rumours
that
we
hardly
know
what
to
believe
xxxviii
pinetown
natal
of
course
you
will
have
heard
that
poor
prince
christian
victor
died
at
pretoria
of
enteric
he
was
buried
in
the
military
cemetery
there
and
there
was
a
service
in
the
cathedral
i
heard
it
was
very
impressive
about
troops
attended
i
should
like
to
have
been
in
pretoria
when
the
proclamation
declaring
the
annexation
of
the
transvaal
was
read
i
heard
it
was
very
fine
lord
roberts
arrived
with
a
big
escort
including
some
fine
indians
and
massed
bands
played
god
save
the
queen
and
then
the
royal
standard
was
run
up
and
then
again
god
save
the
queen
after
that
there
were
no
less
than
six
victoria
crosses
for
lord
roberts
to
pin
on
he
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
old
dutch
church
and
then
there
was
a
march
past
of
troops
i
believe
the
march
past
took
two
hours
though
the
infantry
left
the
square
at
the
double
it
is
very
difficult
to
judge
but
many
people
here
seem
to
think
the
war
is
by
no
means
over
yet
however
if
lord
roberts
does
go
home
we
shall
have
of
to
finish
the
business
the
chief
thing
of
interest
here
early
in
the
month
was
some
difficulty
about
the
three
civil
surgeons
who
were
still
here
of
those
who
came
out
with
us
there
has
been
some
muddle
since
the
government
took
over
the
hospital
as
to
whether
they
were
to
have
the
pay
of
medical
officers
engaged
at
home
or
of
those
engaged
out
here
after
some
correspondence
they
were
dissatisfied
with
the
terms
and
thought
they
were
being
hardly
treated
and
then
a
wire
came
that
they
were
to
prepare
to
proceed
to
england
as
their
services
were
no
longer
required
i
expect
they
will
get
the
matter
settled
all
right
when
they
get
home
it
was
quite
a
business
getting
them
all
packed
up
in
a
hurry
and
they
had
to
arrange
about
selling
their
horses
they
gave
a
farewell
which
we
all
attended
the
army
medical
department
is
a
bit
unsettling
of
course
you
have
to
do
exactly
what
you
are
told
and
you
are
told
to
do
things
so
suddenly
just
a
wire
comes
and
very
often
next
day
you
move
colonel
galway
the
has
gone
home
and
we
miss
him
very
much
he
has
been
so
particularly
nice
every
time
he
has
been
here
we
have
had
a
very
quiet
time
lately
they
are
closing
some
beds
up
at
maritzburg
and
sent
us
down
a
very
good
wardmaster
and
fifteen
orderlies
some
of
them
men
with
six
or
seven
years
service
at
first
the
sisters
could
hardly
realise
that
these
men
were
really
good
nurses
as
they
have
been
so
used
to
having
to
do
most
of
the
nursing
themselves
until
they
had
shown
each
particular
orderly
how
to
do
things
so
they
think
now
that
the
army
sisters
in
time
of
peace
must
have
a
very
easy
life
one
night
we
had
some
people
to
dinner
and
then
they
gave
the
men
such
a
good
concert
some
of
the
orderlies
helped
one
of
them
plays
the
violin
beautifully
and
the
little
australian
boy
bugled
another
day
a
clergyman
who
has
a
boys
school
up
the
line
brought
all
his
boys
down
to
pay
us
a
visit
and
they
played
a
cricket
match
against
the
medical
officers
and
orderlies
one
other
form
of
amusement
has
been
very
popular
with
the
men
though
rather
an
unusual
one
for
hospital
patients
we
have
a
lieutenant
of
the
on
duty
here
now
and
when
he
went
to
the
remount
depot
to
secure
a
horse
he
was
rather
surprised
that
a
very
beast
was
willingly
handed
over
to
him
when
he
said
he
would
like
it
but
when
they
got
it
up
here
it
promptly
chucked
all
the
stableboys
in
turn
and
proved
to
be
a
bad
australian
buckjumper
then
the
men
patients
and
orderlies
wanted
to
try
their
hand
with
him
and
some
of
the
australian
bushmen
are
splendid
at
sticking
on
now
he
is
getting
quite
tame
and
only
bucks
a
little
when
they
first
mount
the
daily
riding
of
the
buckjumper
has
amused
the
whole
camp
and
i
should
simply
have
loved
to
try
my
hand
at
sticking
on
but
my
damaged
side
wo
allow
me
to
ride
anything
for
some
time
yet
though
i
am
getting
about
my
work
all
right
going
slow
they
have
had
a
very
mixed
lot
of
horses
out
here
and
many
people
seem
to
think
the
war
might
have
been
over
now
if
they
had
had
a
better
supply
of
horses
at
first
the
english
chargers
have
worked
awfully
well
but
the
food
of
the
country
has
not
been
suitable
for
them
and
the
little
boer
ponies
are
much
better
suited
for
the
rough
ground
and
the
poor
food
they
are
so
used
to
picking
their
way
on
the
veldt
that
they
hardly
ever
put
a
foot
into
a
hole
and
then
at
night
they
will
peck
about
and
nibble
odds
and
ends
at
which
an
english
horse
turns
up
his
nose
at
first
the
men
did
not
think
the
boer
ponies
were
big
enough
to
carry
the
necessary
weight
but
now
they
find
they
are
and
that
they
wear
better
because
they
are
not
always
hungry
as
seems
to
be
the
case
with
the
unfortunate
big
horses
still
the
good
old
london
horses
have
done
very
useful
work
with
the
guns
they
have
had
many
horses
from
new
zealand
australia
and
the
argentine
these
last
often
very
beasts
as
the
men
all
seem
so
well
satisfied
with
these
boer
ponies
it
might
be
a
good
plan
after
the
war
to
start
a
big
government
breeding
station
out
here
in
some
bit
of
healthy
grass
country
a
man
told
me
they
could
ship
horses
to
england
for
about
for
the
voyage
and
that
if
it
was
undertaken
in
a
proper
way
it
ought
not
to
cost
more
than
about
to
rear
a
horse
or
perhaps
to
put
a
on
board
ship
so
they
could
have
one
of
the
best
landed
in
england
for
under
where
there
is
so
much
trouble
about
getting
the
right
kind
of
horses
in
sufficient
numbers
they
would
be
suitable
for
work
in
almost
any
climate
as
they
have
to
put
up
with
such
rapid
changes
of
temperature
here
we
have
lately
had
a
major
here
partly
as
a
patient
and
partly
as
a
visitor
he
was
in
ladysmith
through
the
siege
and
had
very
hard
work
so
many
doctors
ill
then
he
was
sent
down
to
a
hospital
ship
as
a
patient
and
very
soon
the
was
called
away
and
he
was
put
in
charge
while
still
ill
he
has
been
three
trips
in
her
and
seems
to
have
had
a
lot
of
work
and
worry
and
now
he
is
ordered
to
go
up
and
take
charge
of
a
hospital
and
is
not
in
the
least
fit
for
it
they
wo
spare
any
men
to
be
invalided
home
just
now
as
they
seem
to
want
to
weed
out
all
the
civil
surgeons
first
this
man
wants
the
most
careful
feeding
to
get
him
right
at
first
i
was
always
running
after
him
with
egg
flips
or
some
little
feed
but
now
he
is
beginning
to
enjoy
ordinary
food
better
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
about
the
siege
from
him
he
tells
me
it
was
awful
being
responsible
for
sick
men
and
not
being
able
to
get
things
for
them
at
one
time
he
had
very
sick
under
his
charge
and
all
he
could
get
for
them
was
five
or
sometimes
six
small
tins
of
condensed
milk
a
day
when
they
all
needed
milk
he
says
that
the
men
had
no
time
to
convalesce
it
was
three
days
up
and
out
of
bed
and
then
straight
to
the
trenches
the
poor
fellows
were
so
awfully
weak
that
they
used
to
have
to
send
a
mule
waggon
to
cart
them
down
they
put
a
rifle
in
their
hands
and
carted
them
back
again
at
night
for
a
short
time
too
we
had
another
major
for
a
rest
and
feed
up
he
is
an
when
he
is
at
home
but
was
out
here
with
the
yeomanry
he
is
also
on
the
mend
now
i
have
had
the
very
sweetest
puppy
given
to
me
a
little
black
spaniel
he
has
been
christened
bobs
and
he
follows
me
about
everywhere
i
must
tell
you
a
little
joke
about
some
officers
who
were
here
there
is
a
big
convalescent
depot
at
howick
and
no
one
seems
to
like
going
there
but
at
one
time
we
were
so
full
up
with
officers
and
more
wanting
to
come
that
the
major
chose
out
three
or
four
who
were
practically
well
but
not
quite
fit
to
rough
it
at
the
front
yet
and
sent
them
up
to
howick
we
gave
them
some
sandwiches
and
fruit
to
console
them
on
the
way
and
at
maritzburg
they
bought
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
were
having
a
great
lunch
in
the
train
there
was
one
little
man
in
plain
clothes
in
the
carriage
besides
our
party
so
they
invited
him
to
lunch
but
he
refused
while
they
were
lunching
they
were
all
talking
about
what
a
good
time
they
had
had
here
and
what
hard
luck
it
was
that
the
had
pitched
on
them
to
go
up
to
the
home
for
lost
dogs
as
howick
is
called
every
one
said
it
was
a
horrid
hole
and
of
course
they
exaggerated
all
the
bad
things
they
had
heard
about
it
when
they
got
to
howick
the
little
man
in
plain
clothes
got
out
and
an
orderly
came
up
and
saluted
and
took
his
bag
and
he
proved
to
be
the
colonel
in
charge
at
howick
we
sent
off
sixty
men
on
the
and
a
few
days
later
had
seventy
men
down
from
standerton
all
supposed
to
be
convalescents
but
two
of
them
have
developed
definite
enteric
and
as
they
have
been
at
standerton
for
some
time
ill
with
something
else
they
must
have
become
infected
up
there
i
am
afraid
enteric
is
getting
rather
bad
again
farther
up
but
of
course
there
always
is
more
at
this
season
and
they
are
better
prepared
to
tackle
it
now
the
big
hospital
at
estcourt
has
been
moved
up
to
pretoria
and
i
believe
the
beds
at
maritzburg
have
been
reduced
from
to
and
now
we
hear
that
they
are
having
rather
a
scare
lest
they
should
be
short
of
beds
on
this
side
the
other
day
a
man
from
the
ordnance
department
came
up
to
see
about
putting
new
sinks
in
the
theatre
and
otherwise
improving
the
buildings
so
that
does
not
look
as
though
we
were
to
close
just
yet
but
i
think
if
the
place
is
kept
going
into
the
new
year
they
are
bound
to
send
an
army
superintendent
in
my
place
as
it
would
be
too
irregular
to
leave
me
here
now
that
there
are
so
many
army
sisters
about
with
some
hospitals
already
closed
and
not
by
any
means
all
of
them
acting
as
superintendents
xxxix
canada
between
cape
town
and
helena
we
have
had
an
exciting
time
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
i
had
better
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
you
of
the
upheaval
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
we
heard
that
the
was
hovering
near
so
we
thought
he
would
come
to
inspect
us
and
then
we
should
learn
our
fate
instead
of
that
one
sunday
our
major
had
a
wire
asking
him
to
go
down
to
see
the
in
durban
the
next
morning
on
urgent
business
every
one
was
so
excited
on
monday
they
did
not
know
how
to
work
and
i
saw
that
all
the
medical
officers
were
ready
to
waylay
the
poor
major
as
soon
as
he
got
back
so
i
kept
out
of
the
way
thinking
he
would
be
tired
and
that
we
should
hear
the
news
after
he
had
had
some
tea
but
very
soon
he
came
to
my
room
and
said
well
sister
would
you
like
to
go
to
england
i
only
no
sir
not
particularly
i
think
it
would
be
rather
cold
there
just
now
and
i
should
like
to
see
the
war
through
but
i
to
myself
what
has
gone
wrong
that
he
wants
to
ship
me
off
because
we
had
worried
through
some
very
thick
times
of
difficulties
together
but
then
he
explained
to
me
that
had
been
chosen
to
go
home
in
charge
of
the
sick
on
the
ship
on
which
lord
roberts
was
to
go
the
and
he
was
to
choose
two
sisters
and
some
good
orderlies
to
take
with
him
he
thought
the
trip
would
do
me
good
as
i
had
not
been
really
well
since
my
accident
and
he
thought
i
could
certainly
come
out
again
if
i
wished
but
of
course
i
should
very
likely
not
get
back
here
as
superintendent
i
did
not
mind
that
at
all
as
for
some
time
i
had
been
keen
on
seeing
some
work
farther
and
it
seems
likely
that
this
place
will
become
more
of
a
rest
camp
and
less
of
an
acute
hospital
as
time
goes
on
anyhow
he
seemed
to
wish
me
to
go
with
him
so
in
ten
minutes
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
go
and
we
had
decided
to
take
sister
one
of
our
original
batch
of
sisters
with
us
and
then
there
were
the
orderlies
to
choose
it
was
on
monday
when
i
got
my
marching
orders
and
the
major
had
to
leave
the
next
day
at
and
we
to
follow
him
at
so
you
can
imagine
we
had
a
rush
and
there
was
little
sleep
for
us
that
night
the
lieutenant
was
put
in
temporary
charge
until
the
could
send
a
major
down
my
senior
sister
took
over
the
duty
for
me
and
i
had
to
show
her
all
the
details
about
the
mess
accounts
stores
linen
washing
arrange
to
send
my
dog
back
to
the
people
who
had
given
him
to
me
as
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
land
him
in
england
send
my
saddle
up
to
maritzburg
to
be
sold
so
as
to
make
room
in
my
for
packing
curios
to
say
nothing
of
my
own
packing
up
and
heaps
of
other
things
to
arrange
about
i
could
not
go
to
see
any
of
the
many
friends
who
had
been
so
kind
to
us
but
before
the
ship
sailed
i
was
able
to
write
fifteen
letters
of
farewell
and
apologies
and
managed
to
send
them
ashore
there
was
a
good
deal
to
settle
about
the
servants
too
our
good
madrassee
cook
was
to
leave
the
next
day
and
all
the
black
boys
said
they
no
stay
if
the
big
boss
and
the
little
missus
go
to
england
but
perhaps
they
will
settle
down
again
all
the
orderlies
came
crowding
down
to
the
station
to
see
us
off
and
gave
us
such
cheers
and
john
and
the
other
black
boys
were
all
mopping
their
eyes
charlie
holding
on
to
my
little
bobs
who
was
whining
and
struggling
to
come
with
me
but
he
will
go
back
to
a
very
good
home
when
we
got
on
board
at
durban
we
found
the
ship
had
to
go
to
the
outer
anchorage
we
were
disappointed
that
we
could
not
even
go
up
the
town
to
say
and
really
we
might
have
had
another
night
ashore
as
lord
roberts
never
came
down
till
the
next
day
our
good
friend
from
pinetown
kindly
came
on
board
to
say
and
brought
us
a
lovely
hamper
of
flowers
some
of
which
we
arranged
in
lord
roberts
cabin
fifty
men
were
to
leave
the
day
after
we
did
so
they
will
be
very
light
in
the
hospital
and
the
said
he
should
not
send
more
down
till
he
had
settled
the
staff
lord
roberts
came
on
board
with
his
staff
at
on
december
and
we
sailed
at
once
only
troops
came
on
board
at
durban
but
we
heard
we
should
have
after
cape
town
the
is
a
splendid
boat
with
the
finest
stretch
of
upper
deck
that
i
have
seen
on
any
ship
from
durban
to
cape
town
the
saloon
was
very
empty
besides
sister
and
myself
there
was
only
one
lady
on
board
the
wife
of
a
chaplain
from
wynberg
they
have
been
to
ceylon
for
a
trip
with
a
shipload
of
boer
prisoners
besides
lord
roberts
we
have
on
board
general
ian
hamilton
general
general
marshall
lord
stanley
and
others
i
was
shown
a
copy
of
the
orders
about
the
medical
company
to
be
put
on
board
this
ship
it
read
to
include
two
specially
selected
sisters
it
sounded
like
choosing
turkeys
for
christmas
there
is
a
hospital
with
cots
on
board
but
as
the
men
were
supposed
to
be
chiefly
men
and
not
sick
troops
we
did
not
expect
very
much
work
we
had
fine
weather
coming
round
the
coast
and
lord
roberts
went
ashore
to
receive
addresses
both
at
east
london
and
at
port
elizabeth
after
port
elizabeth
there
was
a
very
heavy
swell
till
we
reached
cape
town
and
poor
sister
was
so
bad
we
were
quite
glad
the
hospital
was
still
empty
before
we
reached
cape
town
lord
roberts
came
up
to
speak
to
me
and
we
had
quite
a
long
chat
he
was
very
anxious
that
we
should
have
everything
that
we
wanted
for
the
hospital
he
told
me
that
lady
roberts
and
his
two
daughters
would
join
us
at
cape
town
and
two
sisters
who
have
been
nursing
her
are
coming
home
with
the
miss
roberts
who
has
been
at
cape
town
lord
roberts
had
a
great
reception
of
which
i
got
some
good
photos
when
i
could
get
away
from
the
ship
i
went
up
the
town
and
wired
to
my
brother
in
kimberley
to
tell
him
that
i
was
going
home
but
after
doing
so
i
thought
i
might
as
well
inquire
whether
by
any
chance
he
was
down
in
cape
town
so
i
went
to
his
club
and
was
much
surprised
to
find
he
was
in
the
town
so
i
left
a
note
to
arrange
to
meet
him
next
day
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
sister
and
i
went
to
service
in
the
cathedral
which
lord
roberts
attended
with
his
staff
and
then
my
brother
met
us
and
took
us
up
to
an
excellent
lunch
at
mount
nelson
hotel
after
lunch
sister
went
off
to
see
some
friends
at
wynberg
and
my
brother
and
i
went
to
see
various
friends
in
the
suburbs
and
finished
up
with
supper
with
the
at
their
lovely
kenilworth
home
it
was
nice
meeting
so
many
old
friends
and
then
i
went
back
to
sleep
on
board
the
next
morning
i
made
a
raid
on
the
red
cross
society
and
the
absent
minded
beggar
people
to
beg
for
games
cards
books
tobacco
for
the
men
on
the
way
home
and
in
a
few
hours
time
they
sent
me
on
a
splendid
supply
then
it
was
ladies
day
at
the
club
so
i
found
time
to
run
up
to
lunch
with
my
brother
there
and
he
had
some
old
kimberley
friends
also
lunching
with
him
after
that
the
troops
were
coming
on
board
so
i
had
to
go
back
to
duty
i
was
appointed
lady
superintendent
for
the
voyage
and
two
more
sisters
were
sent
on
to
help
us
also
three
roman
catholic
sisters
who
had
been
nursing
in
bloemfontein
had
a
passage
home
on
the
and
were
to
be
available
for
duty
if
i
wanted
them
the
cape
town
people
gave
lord
roberts
a
great
send
off
on
december
and
escorted
us
out
to
sea
we
have
very
comfortable
cabins
and
the
major
who
is
on
board
invited
sister
and
me
to
sit
at
his
table
in
the
saloon
with
four
other
officers
so
we
are
well
looked
after
a
great
many
of
the
men
are
wounded
some
of
them
going
home
for
operations
we
had
twenty
sent
straight
into
the
hospital
before
we
sailed
and
we
soon
began
to
fill
up
there
and
to
get
busy
before
we
reached
helena
one
poor
fellow
of
the
yeomanry
had
died
he
did
not
seem
particularly
bad
when
he
came
on
board
but
he
came
down
to
the
hospital
saying
he
felt
a
bit
queer
his
temperature
was
only
but
we
admitted
him
at
once
and
he
was
evidently
just
beginning
a
relapse
enteric
and
then
he
had
a
dreadful
septic
abscess
and
other
complications
so
we
had
to
isolate
him
in
a
little
cabin
to
reach
which
we
had
to
go
past
all
the
stables
there
were
several
horses
on
board
including
the
charger
poor
lieutenant
roberts
was
riding
when
he
fell
he
was
so
bad
one
evening
that
sister
volunteered
to
sit
up
with
him
but
when
i
went
to
relieve
her
at
we
could
both
see
that
he
was
dying
and
sister
offered
to
stay
so
that
i
should
not
infect
myself
but
she
looked
so
done
up
she
is
a
bad
sailor
i
thought
she
had
had
enough
and
the
other
sisters
could
quite
well
manage
the
hospital
so
i
sent
her
to
disinfect
and
go
to
bed
the
poor
man
died
about
and
was
buried
in
the
afternoon
lord
roberts
and
all
his
staff
attending
i
do
think
anything
is
more
solemn
than
a
funeral
at
sea
the
slow
march
out
to
the
stern
and
the
service
read
and
then
the
engines
stop
and
there
is
such
a
hush
when
the
constant
beat
of
the
screw
ceases
next
the
little
splash
as
the
body
heavily
weighted
and
sewn
up
in
a
blanket
slides
into
the
sea
and
then
the
mournful
last
post
sounded
once
more
the
engines
start
and
we
all
go
back
to
our
posts
i
did
not
put
on
a
regular
night
sister
except
when
there
was
special
need
but
we
took
it
in
turns
to
be
responsible
for
a
night
at
a
time
and
the
responsible
one
stayed
up
till
twelve
and
then
if
all
was
quiet
turned
in
and
was
called
again
at
to
take
a
look
round
but
if
she
was
kept
up
much
we
relieved
her
from
duty
for
the
next
morning
we
had
very
good
orderlies
and
we
found
this
plan
worked
well
xl
canada
nearing
helena
on
return
voyage
to
the
cape
i
am
now
on
my
way
back
to
the
cape
after
sixteen
days
leave
in
england
a
rushing
time
amid
snow
and
sleet
but
i
must
first
tell
you
about
the
voyage
home
we
reached
helena
on
december
and
lord
roberts
and
nearly
every
one
went
ashore
for
a
few
hours
i
did
not
go
off
as
i
was
busy
in
the
hospital
several
men
were
very
ill
with
enteric
and
one
with
double
pneumonia
of
course
it
was
frightfully
stuffy
for
them
in
the
hospital
but
lord
roberts
had
most
kindly
said
that
we
were
to
use
part
of
the
upper
deck
that
had
been
reserved
for
him
and
his
family
if
it
would
be
any
better
for
the
men
so
we
rigged
up
a
screen
and
put
two
or
three
men
who
seemed
most
in
need
of
fresh
air
up
there
and
they
were
so
grateful
there
was
always
a
good
supply
of
ice
and
the
sterilised
milk
was
good
one
man
who
was
very
ill
could
not
take
it
but
for
him
i
was
able
to
get
fresh
milk
as
there
were
two
cows
on
board
the
skoff
for
the
convalescents
was
excellent
and
they
were
all
delighted
with
the
variety
of
food
supplied
by
the
company
after
the
sameness
of
the
army
rations
both
the
ship
officers
and
the
stewards
were
most
kind
in
every
way
in
helping
me
to
get
what
i
wanted
for
the
men
we
had
a
spell
of
very
hot
weather
between
the
and
the
and
on
the
we
had
another
sad
death
a
young
john
ambulance
man
who
was
admitted
on
the
with
acute
rheumatism
he
had
had
enteric
in
south
africa
it
was
my
night
on
duty
and
at
i
did
not
think
he
seemed
so
well
and
i
found
his
temperature
had
run
up
to
and
his
pulse
was
very
bad
we
did
everything
that
was
possible
for
the
poor
boy
but
his
temperature
continued
to
rise
and
his
heart
to
fail
he
was
dreadfully
breathless
and
it
was
so
difficult
to
prop
him
up
enough
in
the
bunks
by
his
temperature
had
reached
and
he
knew
that
he
was
dying
and
was
able
to
tell
me
where
to
write
to
his
mother
he
died
very
soon
after
it
was
dreadfully
sad
for
the
other
men
as
of
course
they
were
all
awake
and
in
such
terribly
close
quarters
one
man
in
the
bunk
above
him
and
two
more
close
beside
him
and
it
does
seem
such
hard
luck
for
these
two
men
to
have
got
through
their
time
in
south
africa
and
then
to
knock
over
just
when
they
are
nearing
home
a
nice
sergeant
in
a
bunk
near
by
saw
that
i
was
very
much
cut
up
about
this
poor
boy
and
said
never
mind
sister
no
one
could
have
done
more
for
the
poor
lad
to
give
him
a
chance
than
you
have
but
i
know
i
have
seen
many
men
die
on
the
battlefield
but
it
a
lot
worse
to
see
one
die
between
decks
here
afterwards
we
carried
him
out
to
a
small
bathroom
and
he
was
buried
the
next
day
i
found
one
of
the
patients
in
the
hospital
was
a
bart
student
who
had
been
serving
at
the
front
both
lord
and
lady
roberts
took
a
great
interest
in
the
men
and
lord
roberts
used
to
come
up
to
me
in
the
morning
and
ask
how
they
had
got
through
the
night
and
he
would
ask
after
the
men
who
were
especially
ill
by
name
of
course
they
were
awfully
pleased
when
i
told
them
they
both
went
round
the
hospital
several
times
and
on
christmas
day
they
went
down
and
shook
hands
with
all
the
men
in
hospital
wishing
them
a
happy
day
and
then
they
sent
down
a
large
sugared
cake
and
some
chocolate
for
the
men
who
were
well
enough
to
enjoy
it
and
the
very
sick
ones
all
had
some
champagne
the
men
appreciated
it
very
much
and
there
was
a
great
demand
for
envelopes
to
take
a
bit
of
bobs
cake
home
many
of
the
beautiful
baskets
of
flowers
that
came
on
board
for
lady
roberts
at
the
different
ports
found
their
way
down
to
the
hospital
and
the
men
especially
treasured
a
beautiful
union
jack
that
came
on
board
at
madeira
made
of
red
geraniums
and
blue
and
white
violets
by
the
it
had
become
cooler
and
rather
damp
so
all
the
men
returned
to
the
hospital
from
the
upper
deck
on
the
one
of
the
officer
patients
had
to
have
an
an√¶sthetic
for
a
slight
operation
on
his
arm
and
i
had
a
busy
night
in
the
hospital
as
one
man
had
a
fit
and
there
were
several
enterics
very
on
christmas
day
it
was
good
to
see
about
twenty
officers
and
between
forty
and
fifty
men
at
the
early
communion
service
and
we
also
had
a
service
in
the
hospital
the
saloon
was
quite
full
for
the
morning
services
at
and
at
there
were
too
many
for
all
to
attend
one
service
sister
and
i
found
two
huge
stockings
on
our
plates
at
breakfast
time
with
all
sorts
of
silly
presents
in
them
we
had
a
very
pleasant
day
and
a
jolly
dinner
party
at
night
we
reached
madeira
that
evening
and
did
not
leave
again
till
the
next
day
so
i
had
a
run
ashore
with
some
people
in
the
morning
on
the
we
anchored
at
gibraltar
at
and
the
guns
thundered
out
such
a
welcome
to
lord
roberts
we
stayed
there
till
the
next
day
and
i
again
went
ashore
with
some
friends
and
had
a
good
look
round
the
town
sir
george
white
and
his
daughter
came
on
board
and
afterwards
lord
and
lady
roberts
went
ashore
we
had
fairly
good
weather
all
the
way
home
but
after
gibraltar
the
ship
was
rather
inclined
to
roll
the
remark
on
the
ship
log
was
fresh
to
moderate
gale
with
confused
sea
two
of
the
sisters
were
rather
bad
so
the
remaining
sister
and
i
had
a
busy
time
between
the
sick
officers
and
the
hospital
and
though
neither
of
us
was
i
ca
say
that
we
exactly
enjoyed
it
when
we
had
to
sponge
a
bad
typhoid
in
an
upper
berth
to
reach
whom
we
had
to
stand
on
a
box
and
have
a
man
wedged
in
the
gangway
to
hold
our
basin
of
water
never
quite
sure
whether
the
next
roll
would
not
oblige
him
to
pitch
all
the
water
over
either
us
or
our
patient
and
the
daily
syringing
of
the
arm
of
the
officer
who
had
the
operation
was
just
about
as
much
as
i
could
stand
on
the
rough
days
so
we
were
glad
when
the
wind
abated
and
all
the
sisters
could
take
their
turn
for
night
duty
lord
roberts
was
awfully
nice
to
me
about
having
looked
after
the
men
on
board
and
he
asked
me
whether
i
wanted
anything
he
could
help
me
with
so
i
told
him
i
only
wanted
to
be
sure
they
would
let
me
go
back
and
do
some
more
work
and
not
get
sent
to
a
home
station
so
he
most
kindly
sent
for
his
secretary
and
asked
him
to
write
to
the
to
say
he
would
be
obliged
if
my
wishes
on
this
point
could
be
attended
to
was
it
not
kind
of
him
if
i
had
not
been
so
surprised
i
should
have
asked
to
be
allowed
to
work
for
the
same
major
again
but
he
was
just
chatting
in
such
a
kind
informal
way
on
the
deck
that
i
did
not
realise
how
much
he
could
have
helped
me
if
i
had
thought
to
ask
i
saw
the
new
year
in
down
in
the
hospital
and
the
stokers
made
such
a
noise
to
celebrate
it
beating
with
their
shovels
luckily
by
then
all
our
patients
were
improving
though
some
of
them
were
still
very
ill
all
except
the
very
sick
ones
were
tremendously
excited
at
the
thought
of
getting
home
we
were
rather
before
our
time
so
on
the
evening
of
january
we
had
to
anchor
in
swanage
bay
and
then
arrived
and
anchored
off
cowes
the
next
morning
at
it
was
freezing
hard
and
bitterly
cold
and
we
were
all
longing
to
get
home
but
in
the
afternoon
lord
roberts
went
ashore
to
be
received
by
queen
victoria
at
osborne
he
returned
an
earl
and
a
knight
of
the
garter
and
i
believe
the
queen
handed
him
the
won
by
his
son
at
colenso
that
night
we
anchored
off
netley
and
the
cold
was
intense
we
got
up
to
southampton
at
on
january
and
such
a
crowd
was
there
to
welcome
lord
roberts
of
course
it
was
some
time
before
he
got
away
and
we
could
get
our
patients
landed
but
as
soon
as
we
got
into
dock
some
orderlies
came
on
board
from
netley
with
a
good
supply
of
fresh
milk
which
was
much
enjoyed
in
the
hospital
and
eventually
we
were
thankful
to
see
all
the
bad
cases
safely
off
to
netley
three
of
them
had
been
so
very
ill
and
several
times
we
had
thought
they
could
not
live
to
get
home
it
is
always
a
little
sad
saying
to
people
you
have
got
to
know
well
on
board
ship
but
not
nearly
so
bad
near
home
as
out
at
the
front
we
had
orders
to
report
ourselves
at
the
war
office
and
after
having
cleared
up
the
hospital
we
were
able
to
get
away
about
the
next
day
i
called
at
the
war
office
and
presented
lord
letter
and
was
told
that
i
should
go
back
they
would
let
me
know
when
and
then
i
went
on
leave
on
the
of
january
i
had
a
wire
to
rejoin
the
ship
for
the
return
voyage
on
the
it
was
bitterly
cold
all
the
time
i
was
in
england
and
i
had
rather
a
rush
to
get
some
new
uniform
and
other
necessaries
to
unpack
and
sort
myself
and
repack
again
when
i
got
on
board
the
i
was
rejoiced
to
find
that
sister
was
returning
too
and
three
of
our
original
medical
officers
the
ship
was
very
full
in
the
saloon
and
there
were
sixteen
sisters
and
one
other
lady
but
my
old
friend
the
stewardess
was
kind
enough
to
manoeuvre
so
that
i
got
a
small
cabin
to
myself
just
before
we
got
away
the
backed
into
our
stern
and
sent
us
first
with
such
a
bang
against
the
wharf
that
the
people
standing
there
fell
down
flat
like
ninepins
and
it
was
raining
so
there
were
inches
of
mud
for
them
to
fall
into
and
then
we
broke
away
from
our
moorings
with
some
visitors
and
the
embarkation
officers
still
on
board
after
a
little
excitement
they
managed
to
anchor
off
netley
and
found
our
damage
was
chiefly
to
the
boat
deck
one
boat
was
stove
in
and
the
railings
it
would
have
been
more
serious
if
our
steam
had
not
been
up
and
ready
for
us
to
get
away
so
they
were
able
to
get
her
under
control
at
once
but
there
we
had
to
remain
all
the
next
day
repairing
and
it
was
very
tantalising
having
to
waste
that
time
on
board
especially
as
i
have
some
relations
who
live
within
a
couple
of
miles
of
where
we
were
anchored
before
we
sailed
we
heard
that
the
queen
was
very
ill
and
i
fear
she
has
been
very
feeble
lately
and
very
much
troubled
about
the
war
so
we
all
feel
anxious
and
every
night
when
the
band
plays
god
save
the
queen
and
all
stand
at
the
salute
we
wonder
how
she
is
xli
victorian
between
cape
town
and
durban
just
as
we
got
in
sight
of
helena
on
february
our
engines
broke
down
and
we
had
to
lay
to
for
some
hours
while
they
were
being
repaired
then
as
we
steamed
slowly
up
to
the
anchorage
signalled
to
us
that
our
queen
had
died
on
january
so
we
ought
to
have
been
singing
god
save
the
for
the
past
eleven
days
the
men
were
all
joking
and
playing
games
when
the
news
came
and
then
there
was
such
a
hush
of
sorrow
on
the
boat
and
all
the
games
were
put
away
we
were
at
helena
all
the
next
day
while
the
repairs
were
going
on
the
arrived
with
boer
prisoners
and
last
week
they
had
from
simon
town
since
we
were
last
here
some
of
the
prisoners
had
made
an
attempt
at
escape
and
they
had
also
had
a
nasty
mutiny
amongst
the
men
of
the
west
indian
regiment
who
were
stationed
there
we
anchored
in
table
bay
after
a
very
uneventful
voyage
with
no
work
in
the
hospital
except
five
cases
of
german
measles
on
february
but
did
not
get
alongside
till
the
following
evening
and
then
as
we
were
receiving
fresh
orders
about
every
half
hour
we
stayed
quietly
on
board
till
the
when
the
was
sailing
again
the
only
thing
that
was
definite
was
that
the
medical
officers
and
sisters
who
had
been
in
natal
before
were
to
return
to
that
command
but
how
to
get
there
was
a
different
matter
the
ship
by
which
they
proposed
to
send
us
by
was
not
yet
in
and
it
seemed
likely
that
when
the
left
we
should
remain
on
the
wharf
sitting
on
our
boxes
sister
and
i
were
the
only
sisters
who
had
been
in
natal
before
so
we
saw
the
others
off
by
train
for
pretoria
and
elandsfontein
then
the
of
came
in
and
she
was
so
full
she
could
only
just
take
on
the
medical
officers
and
sister
and
i
had
to
wait
to
go
by
some
other
boat
but
we
were
told
we
could
go
out
to
wynberg
and
lodge
at
the
hospital
till
they
could
find
berths
for
us
leaving
our
heavy
baggage
in
store
at
the
docks
there
we
were
kept
waiting
ten
days
for
a
ship
and
had
a
very
dull
time
of
it
as
we
were
afraid
to
go
to
any
distance
in
case
any
sudden
orders
came
for
us
wynberg
is
a
very
pretty
place
in
pine
woods
but
the
huts
were
infested
with
creatures
so
that
sleep
was
difficult
and
though
we
are
neither
of
us
very
particular
about
our
food
it
was
so
badly
served
and
dirty
that
we
could
not
enjoy
it
i
ca
understand
about
the
mess
as
the
sisters
have
to
pay
all
their
allowance
of
a
week
for
food
and
do
get
anything
like
such
good
food
as
we
had
at
a
cost
of
or
a
week
though
the
actual
cost
of
food
is
less
at
cape
town
and
they
have
no
variety
there
were
some
pretoria
sisters
staying
there
to
recruit
after
enteric
and
i
felt
so
sorry
for
them
as
the
food
was
absolutely
unsuitable
for
convalescents
and
they
told
me
they
had
been
very
well
cared
for
all
the
time
they
were
ill
at
pretoria
and
so
they
were
missing
the
careful
feeding
they
had
been
used
to
of
course
we
did
not
get
to
know
really
very
much
about
the
hospital
as
we
were
not
on
duty
and
were
only
lodgers
but
a
sister
who
came
out
with
us
was
on
duty
and
was
not
at
all
happy
there
were
so
many
petty
rules
for
the
sisters
that
they
seemed
to
spend
their
time
in
trying
to
evade
them
not
a
good
hospital
tone
we
found
no
news
at
all
in
the
cape
town
papers
but
certainly
the
war
does
not
seem
likely
to
be
over
just
yet
they
say
all
civil
traffic
and
mails
north
of
de
aar
have
been
stopped
there
was
a
rumour
that
there
were
boers
within
thirty
miles
of
cape
town
so
all
the
boer
prisoners
were
being
sent
away
from
simon
town
some
naval
guns
have
been
mounted
on
the
lion
head
a
part
of
table
mountain
and
the
town
guard
were
sent
up
there
in
watches
as
well
as
some
of
the
regulars
the
town
guard
were
most
energetic
and
constantly
drilling
one
day
i
wanted
to
speak
to
one
of
the
customs
men
and
found
they
were
all
drilling
with
their
rifles
in
the
customs
shed
and
the
business
had
to
wait
then
of
course
you
will
have
heard
there
was
plague
in
cape
town
and
there
was
some
alarm
lest
it
should
get
amongst
the
soldiers
and
cripple
us
in
that
way
but
they
seem
to
be
attacking
it
in
an
energetic
way
and
so
far
it
is
practically
confined
to
the
coloured
people
as
usual
it
started
among
the
rats
on
the
south
arm
at
the
docks
large
numbers
of
them
died
and
the
rest
went
off
in
a
body
to
green
point
at
which
place
there
is
a
large
military
camp
so
that
the
sanitary
officials
were
rather
anxious
then
the
natives
got
frightened
and
wanted
to
go
home
but
the
government
stopped
that
by
not
allowing
any
of
them
to
travel
by
train
except
with
special
permits
this
was
partly
to
prevent
their
spreading
the
plague
about
the
country
and
also
because
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
get
the
dock
work
done
if
the
natives
had
cleared
at
the
same
time
a
large
native
location
is
being
built
on
the
cape
flats
where
they
will
all
have
to
live
and
a
light
railway
to
bring
them
into
their
work
rats
are
being
bought
for
threepence
each
and
several
hundreds
of
their
bodies
are
being
cremated
daily
at
the
gasworks
at
last
we
went
into
cape
town
and
saw
the
but
he
said
he
could
not
say
when
we
should
get
on
so
we
went
on
to
our
friend
the
embarkation
officer
and
told
him
that
if
there
was
no
transport
coming
soon
we
would
pay
our
own
passage
to
go
up
to
natal
by
a
mailboat
rather
than
waste
more
time
at
wynberg
but
he
promised
we
should
get
a
ship
before
the
next
mail
and
save
our
money
which
we
were
glad
enough
to
do
but
my
private
opinion
is
that
we
should
have
been
waiting
at
wynberg
still
if
we
had
not
gone
into
cape
town
and
agitated
about
it
we
paid
a
visit
to
the
yeomanry
hospital
at
maitland
where
a
brother
of
sister
was
in
as
a
patient
but
getting
better
and
i
found
several
old
friends
on
the
staff
there
at
last
on
the
we
received
orders
to
join
the
at
cape
town
it
was
pouring
with
rain
but
sister
went
off
at
once
to
find
a
cab
while
i
hastily
packed
up
paid
our
mess
bill
before
she
got
back
there
was
a
telephone
message
to
tell
us
to
hurry
as
the
ship
was
going
soon
we
bundled
our
things
on
to
the
cab
and
just
managed
to
catch
a
train
at
wynberg
which
by
good
luck
was
an
express
as
most
of
the
trains
loiter
about
at
all
the
suburban
stations
at
cape
town
we
hastily
cabbed
to
the
office
for
orders
but
were
told
to
go
straight
down
to
the
ship
at
the
dock
gates
i
sent
sister
on
with
our
small
things
to
the
ship
to
say
we
were
coming
while
i
went
to
the
agents
and
was
lucky
in
finding
an
empty
trolley
and
getting
them
to
tumble
our
heavy
baggage
on
to
it
though
they
said
it
was
too
late
for
the
as
she
had
been
hooting
for
some
time
however
i
got
on
to
the
waggon
and
rattled
down
to
the
south
arm
there
i
found
sister
looking
very
melancholy
as
they
told
her
on
board
we
were
not
expected
and
there
was
no
room
for
us
and
where
were
our
written
orders
of
course
we
no
written
orders
as
all
had
been
by
telephone
but
i
did
not
mean
to
be
left
behind
so
taking
my
bag
and
telling
sister
to
bring
hers
i
bundled
up
the
gangway
which
they
were
on
the
point
of
removing
and
asked
to
see
the
telling
them
that
i
did
not
mind
a
bit
if
there
was
no
cabin
but
that
we
could
travel
on
deck
just
then
the
embarkation
officer
came
bustling
along
and
said
that
he
had
thought
we
could
not
get
down
in
time
but
that
it
was
all
right
and
they
had
got
to
make
room
for
us
so
some
soldiers
soon
carried
our
baggage
on
board
and
as
our
last
box
came
on
the
embarkation
officer
went
off
and
we
were
away
the
cabins
were
really
all
full
but
after
some
delay
two
poor
young
officers
had
to
double
in
with
some
others
and
give
us
their
cabin
the
is
rather
a
grubby
boat
a
when
she
is
at
home
there
are
two
hundred
boer
prisoners
on
board
going
up
to
a
place
near
ladysmith
four
of
them
are
officers
who
are
berthed
on
the
upper
deck
but
do
mess
with
us
they
seem
quite
a
superior
sort
one
of
them
was
a
commandant
and
they
are
very
polite
to
us
always
ready
to
move
our
chairs
or
to
do
anything
to
help
us
there
are
about
twenty
officers
in
the
saloon
and
one
officer
wife
the
ship
is
not
accustomed
to
having
any
ladies
on
board
but
every
one
is
very
good
to
us
and
the
stewards
are
most
attentive
there
is
no
stewardess
i
sit
next
to
the
a
colonel
from
australia
who
had
had
a
bad
fall
from
his
horse
and
is
going
back
to
australia
for
the
voyage
to
recruit
this
boat
is
going
to
take
men
from
durban
to
australia
and
will
return
with
a
full
load
of
men
and
horses
from
there
he
and
his
son
have
both
been
fighting
out
here
just
lately
he
has
been
a
patient
in
the
hospital
where
we
have
been
lodging
and
he
speaks
very
plainly
about
the
bad
management
there
after
he
had
been
very
well
nursed
in
another
hospital
there
is
a
very
pleasant
and
very
irish
major
in
medical
charge
he
has
had
a
rough
time
trekking
about
with
his
regiment
for
the
last
fifteen
months
and
is
now
going
for
the
trip
to
australia
to
recruit
after
fever
he
wants
us
to
go
with
him
as
they
will
probably
send
a
couple
of
sisters
and
we
already
have
the
promise
of
a
good
time
in
australia
while
the
ship
is
there
sister
says
she
would
like
to
go
but
i
would
like
to
see
this
show
through
first
the
officer
wife
has
been
in
her
cabin
all
the
way
so
we
have
had
to
look
after
her
a
bit
it
has
been
a
little
rough
but
even
sister
has
kept
well
we
conclude
because
we
had
been
doing
a
compulsory
fast
in
consequence
of
the
bad
feeding
at
wynberg
before
we
came
on
board
we
should
have
thought
the
feeding
on
this
boat
very
poor
after
the
but
it
is
first
rate
after
wynberg
we
shall
soon
be
at
durban
now
and
then
they
say
we
may
have
to
be
quarantined
outside
for
ten
days
on
account
of
the
plague
at
the
cape
but
we
hope
our
services
may
be
so
urgently
required
at
the
front
that
they
may
forget
to
quarantine
us
xlii
general
hospital
natal
we
arrived
at
durban
on
february
and
were
eventually
allowed
to
land
without
being
quarantined
it
was
saturday
afternoon
and
no
orders
came
on
board
for
us
and
by
the
time
the
boer
prisoners
were
landed
and
we
were
able
to
get
our
baggage
ashore
the
durban
had
left
his
office
so
we
felt
free
to
do
as
we
pleased
till
the
following
day
when
though
sunday
we
be
able
to
report
ourselves
if
we
had
been
new
sisters
arriving
it
might
have
been
awkward
but
it
suited
us
down
to
the
ground
sister
just
caught
the
evening
train
up
to
pinetown
to
stay
with
some
friends
and
i
promised
to
wire
to
her
if
we
were
needed
on
sunday
otherwise
she
would
return
on
monday
then
a
kind
helped
me
to
get
our
baggage
on
to
a
trolley
and
take
it
up
to
the
medical
store
where
it
would
be
quite
safe
and
after
that
i
went
up
to
see
some
friends
on
the
berea
and
they
most
kindly
took
me
in
from
them
i
learnt
many
things
amongst
others
that
our
old
hospital
had
been
turned
into
a
rest
camp
of
beds
and
that
they
thought
we
were
to
have
the
chance
of
going
back
there
but
for
various
reasons
they
strongly
advised
us
not
to
do
so
if
we
could
avoid
it
that
our
late
medical
officers
had
already
been
sent
farther
we
had
hoped
to
work
for
them
again
but
did
not
succeed
in
doing
so
on
sunday
morning
i
went
to
report
ourselves
to
major
and
he
was
very
pleasant
and
kind
wanted
to
hear
all
about
our
voyage
home
and
asked
me
where
we
wanted
to
go
so
i
told
him
as
near
up
to
the
front
as
we
could
get
then
he
told
me
that
the
order
from
the
natal
was
for
us
to
return
to
pinetown
but
if
i
liked
he
would
wire
to
him
to
ask
him
to
let
us
go
and
that
we
could
stay
with
our
friends
till
he
got
a
reply
i
had
a
quiet
sunday
in
durban
meeting
many
friends
and
going
to
church
in
the
evening
the
next
morning
i
met
sister
at
the
station
and
the
first
thing
she
said
to
me
before
i
could
tell
her
the
orders
was
sister
i
go
to
pinetown
i
would
rather
resign
if
they
want
to
send
us
there
so
then
i
told
her
that
our
fate
was
waiting
on
a
wire
from
the
and
as
we
walked
along
to
the
office
she
told
me
a
good
deal
of
what
she
had
heard
about
pinetown
of
course
we
can
scarcely
judge
how
much
of
it
is
really
true
but
at
any
rate
it
appears
that
some
of
the
sisters
now
there
seem
to
think
that
they
have
come
out
to
south
africa
only
to
enjoy
themselves
and
that
they
are
setting
about
it
in
a
way
which
no
lady
would
care
to
emulate
it
was
rather
strange
that
we
should
both
have
received
the
same
advice
from
quite
different
sources
do
go
there
together
we
went
to
the
office
and
stayed
there
some
time
but
no
wire
had
come
they
thought
we
should
probably
go
by
the
mail
train
we
were
advised
to
take
some
food
if
we
went
up
as
meals
on
the
way
were
uncertain
so
i
stocked
my
and
bought
some
potted
meat
in
case
we
went
all
day
we
had
to
hover
near
the
office
or
within
sound
of
the
telephone
and
at
a
wire
came
for
us
to
go
up
to
no
general
hospital
by
the
mail
train
one
of
the
medical
officers
kindly
helped
us
to
get
our
baggage
to
the
station
and
secured
a
carriage
for
us
it
is
always
a
shaky
journey
up
from
durban
but
we
got
some
sleep
and
the
next
morning
when
we
were
having
breakfast
at
glencoe
we
were
delighted
to
meet
major
of
the
royal
engineers
an
old
patient
of
ours
who
has
done
splendid
work
up
this
side
he
was
going
down
to
ladysmith
a
little
farther
on
we
met
two
officers
who
had
come
out
in
the
with
us
so
they
came
into
our
carriage
and
shared
our
lunch
and
we
brewed
some
tea
with
my
at
newcastle
general
hilliard
was
on
the
platform
and
also
a
sister
whom
we
knew
we
had
no
sooner
reached
our
destination
than
sergeant
came
up
to
welcome
us
he
had
been
at
pinetown
and
also
went
home
with
us
he
does
not
seem
at
all
pleased
at
being
sent
here
and
is
already
trying
to
get
a
change
this
hospital
has
been
a
stationary
hospital
up
to
now
but
is
just
being
turned
into
a
general
hospital
so
they
say
it
is
in
rather
a
muddle
at
present
sister
and
i
were
allotted
a
tent
with
just
bed
and
blankets
nothing
else
we
were
not
required
on
duty
that
day
so
we
went
down
to
the
coolie
store
and
invested
in
some
cheap
sheets
a
bucket
basin
also
table
fittings
as
they
told
us
no
plates
cups
knives
or
anything
were
provided
many
people
out
here
prefer
to
sleep
in
blankets
but
as
the
army
blankets
are
dark
brown
rather
of
the
texture
of
horsecloths
and
as
these
were
obviously
not
new
and
the
washing
and
disinfecting
of
army
blankets
in
a
satisfactory
way
is
still
an
unsolved
problem
out
here
we
preferred
to
put
some
sheets
in
between
the
air
is
lovely
and
fresh
up
here
where
we
are
feet
above
the
always
hot
sun
in
the
day
but
very
cold
nights
a
most
unfortunate
thing
occurred
the
first
night
we
were
here
a
sister
who
came
out
in
the
with
us
had
two
large
cases
of
feather
cushions
given
her
by
the
princess
of
wales
whom
we
must
now
learn
to
call
queen
alexandra
with
the
request
that
they
should
go
to
men
in
hospital
near
up
to
the
front
she
had
promised
me
that
if
i
went
i
should
have
one
of
the
boxes
to
distribute
when
we
arrived
here
i
found
a
wire
from
her
saying
that
she
was
passing
our
station
about
and
would
i
meet
her
she
was
one
of
the
sisters
who
had
landed
at
cape
town
but
was
now
coming
down
to
a
hospital
on
this
side
so
when
we
had
got
our
tent
straight
we
went
to
the
lady
superintendent
and
said
that
if
we
were
really
not
wanted
on
duty
might
we
go
down
to
the
station
after
dinner
to
meet
this
sister
she
said
certainly
we
might
she
was
sorry
she
had
some
letters
to
write
or
she
would
have
walked
down
with
us
when
we
got
to
the
station
we
found
we
were
rather
too
soon
and
there
were
a
lot
of
orderlies
standing
about
and
a
few
officers
whom
of
course
we
did
not
know
so
i
said
to
sister
i
vote
we
walk
about
outside
till
we
hear
the
train
coming
and
we
were
just
beating
a
retreat
from
the
platform
when
an
officer
stalked
up
and
said
in
a
very
rude
way
who
are
you
we
just
gave
our
names
and
were
walking
away
when
he
again
stopped
us
and
asked
what
we
wanted
at
the
station
by
this
time
sister
was
bubbling
over
with
wrath
but
we
had
to
explain
that
we
had
obtained
leave
to
meet
a
sister
i
believe
if
i
had
said
that
i
was
expecting
a
box
of
things
from
the
queen
he
would
have
knuckled
under
but
i
was
not
going
to
trade
on
that
and
the
long
and
short
of
it
was
that
he
did
not
believe
that
we
had
been
given
leave
and
said
we
were
not
allowed
in
the
station
and
were
to
return
to
camp
of
course
we
went
back
furious
at
his
rudeness
and
then
discovered
he
was
the
here
i
expect
the
lady
superintendent
had
forgotten
to
tell
him
we
had
leave
or
something
of
that
kind
but
he
might
have
believed
our
word
and
not
been
so
rude
to
us
before
a
lot
of
orderlies
and
she
was
very
much
annoyed
with
him
the
next
morning
when
we
were
formally
introduced
to
him
he
was
i
think
penitent
and
invited
us
to
go
out
for
a
picnic
on
the
following
day
when
some
people
whom
we
knew
were
coming
here
partly
to
inspect
the
hospital
and
partly
for
this
excursion
sister
went
with
them
but
i
was
going
on
night
duty
that
night
so
i
begged
off
this
is
a
ration
station
as
it
would
be
difficult
to
buy
food
privately
so
far
from
the
base
therefore
we
do
get
quite
so
many
allowances
but
the
skoff
seems
very
fairly
good
they
bake
bread
in
the
camp
and
as
long
as
you
can
get
decent
bread
you
can
be
content
we
are
just
on
the
border
of
the
transvaal
and
there
are
plenty
of
boers
about
two
or
three
of
our
columns
are
trekking
about
in
the
district
and
they
say
that
we
often
have
sick
and
wounded
sent
in
from
them
most
of
the
sisters
here
seem
to
ride
but
i
ca
take
to
that
again
yet
the
night
sisters
had
a
little
excitement
two
nights
ago
when
two
horses
galloped
into
the
camp
and
they
with
the
help
of
a
convalescent
officer
caught
and
tethered
them
they
hoped
they
would
be
allowed
to
keep
them
but
unfortunately
they
were
reclaimed
by
some
yeomanry
men
but
they
say
that
very
often
droves
of
horses
pass
here
and
sometimes
a
few
escape
or
are
left
behind
too
sick
or
too
tired
to
go
on
and
then
the
orderlies
catch
them
and
sell
them
to
the
sisters
for
or
i
think
there
are
about
beds
here
nearly
all
under
canvas
there
are
a
few
buildings
of
wood
and
amongst
them
is
a
small
room
that
the
sisters
use
as
a
duty
room
and
the
night
sisters
two
of
them
sit
there
and
they
have
a
small
stove
for
boiling
water
there
is
no
arrangement
for
hot
water
near
the
tents
for
the
patients
we
used
to
have
and
i
have
seen
them
in
other
hospitals
too
boilers
on
wheels
with
a
coolie
to
keep
the
fire
going
and
if
the
water
was
not
always
hot
the
coolie
soon
heard
about
it
from
the
orderlies
one
day
the
asked
me
whether
i
had
everything
i
wanted
and
i
said
no
i
wanted
a
good
many
things
for
the
men
one
being
hot
water
but
he
said
he
had
never
heard
of
these
movable
boilers
and
seemed
to
think
them
an
unnecessary
luxury
at
the
sisters
camp
we
have
a
comfortable
room
that
they
use
as
a
with
a
mixed
lot
of
furniture
that
has
been
commandeered
from
houses
in
the
district
the
other
day
an
officer
sent
us
a
lot
of
china
plates
taken
from
a
boer
hotel
they
were
very
welcome
as
we
were
most
of
us
using
enamel
plates
out
of
our
we
have
our
meals
in
a
tent
just
a
long
table
and
benches
without
backs
our
sleeping
tents
are
chiefly
the
big
square
kind
called
tents
they
are
supposed
to
hold
four
beds
so
we
may
have
to
pack
tight
but
at
present
sister
and
i
are
alone
some
of
the
sisters
have
made
their
tents
very
nice
and
have
rigged
up
curtains
to
divide
them
at
present
we
use
our
boxes
as
washstand
and
as
a
general
hospital
is
given
a
certain
amount
of
furniture
for
the
sisters
we
intend
not
to
buy
anything
that
is
not
really
necessary
until
we
see
what
they
are
going
to
give
us
xliii
general
hospital
natal
now
i
have
waded
both
literally
and
figuratively
through
my
first
spell
of
a
fortnight
on
night
duty
and
it
has
not
been
pleasant
but
when
one
thinks
how
much
worse
it
must
be
for
the
troops
out
trekking
one
does
not
mind
i
have
always
thought
that
south
africa
the
was
rather
a
poor
sort
of
a
place
and
living
in
a
tent
in
the
wet
season
i
am
confirmed
in
that
opinion
it
began
to
rain
the
first
night
i
went
on
duty
and
during
the
fortnight
i
had
only
four
fine
nights
the
other
nights
it
rained
generally
in
bucketfuls
the
first
day
when
i
went
to
bed
it
was
very
hot
and
stuffy
in
the
tent
so
i
did
not
sleep
for
some
time
but
was
sleeping
in
the
afternoon
when
the
rain
began
and
soon
it
woke
me
up
by
splashing
on
my
face
then
i
found
it
was
coming
down
in
torrents
and
our
tent
had
been
so
badly
pitched
with
no
trench
round
it
that
there
was
a
deep
stream
flowing
through
i
had
to
paddle
about
and
rescue
all
our
goods
from
the
floor
pitching
most
of
them
on
to
sister
bed
and
she
was
rather
amused
when
she
came
over
to
call
me
to
find
me
fast
asleep
under
a
mackintosh
and
umbrella
my
bed
a
simple
island
and
no
room
for
her
to
get
into
her
own
bed
most
of
the
sisters
were
prepared
for
this
and
had
suitable
garments
but
it
was
several
days
before
i
could
obtain
them
so
i
very
soon
had
not
a
dry
garment
to
my
name
before
i
leave
the
subject
i
may
as
well
tell
you
what
is
the
correct
garb
and
then
you
can
imagine
us
sitting
on
a
bench
at
our
mess
and
i
am
sure
no
one
seeing
us
would
think
we
were
sisters
with
our
lanterns
hung
up
behind
us
we
look
more
like
miners
or
something
of
that
sort
the
first
essential
is
a
pair
of
knee
gum
boots
as
the
grass
between
the
tents
is
long
then
you
must
have
knickerbockers
with
a
very
short
serge
skirt
some
omit
the
skirt
altogether
on
night
duty
then
a
mackintosh
when
it
does
not
rain
you
substitute
for
the
mackintosh
a
british
warmer
coat
that
is
the
short
khaki
overcoat
that
both
officers
and
privates
wear
a
very
rough
wool
with
a
warm
flannel
lining
for
headgear
we
have
a
sailor
hat
or
a
wool
cap
or
a
according
to
taste
white
caps
and
aprons
are
quite
impossible
when
you
have
to
go
from
tent
to
tent
of
course
there
is
no
chance
of
drying
anything
till
the
sun
comes
out
again
and
when
we
get
out
of
bed
it
would
never
do
to
turn
it
down
instead
of
that
you
put
anything
you
wish
to
to
keep
dry
inside
and
cover
it
all
up
with
every
rug
and
blanket
and
mackintosh
that
you
can
lay
hands
on
our
tent
was
so
hopelessly
bad
that
after
some
days
they
let
us
move
into
another
and
that
one
having
a
wooden
floor
we
were
better
off
i
was
so
tired
after
moving
our
things
into
the
new
tent
and
after
a
heavy
night
on
duty
in
the
pouring
rain
that
i
slept
like
a
top
and
when
i
woke
in
the
evening
i
found
everything
upset
in
the
tent
and
evident
marks
that
a
cow
had
been
taking
shelter
with
me
the
sisters
gibed
at
me
and
said
i
should
probably
not
have
waked
up
if
it
had
been
a
boer
commando
there
are
a
lot
of
men
very
ill
i
was
supposed
to
have
charge
on
night
duty
of
the
medical
side
about
beds
and
that
included
the
enteric
tents
with
about
beds
they
seem
to
have
a
mania
for
shifting
the
men
about
so
it
was
often
difficult
to
find
the
bad
cases
there
were
generally
only
night
orderlies
in
the
enteric
tents
so
that
men
who
needed
much
attention
in
the
night
were
supposed
to
be
sent
to
the
enteric
line
whether
they
had
enteric
or
not
to
escape
this
risk
of
infection
for
them
we
sisters
used
to
try
to
do
all
for
them
in
their
own
tents
as
long
as
we
possibly
could
and
the
poor
chaps
were
so
grateful
to
us
and
the
day
sisters
who
were
equally
keen
not
to
have
them
sent
down
used
to
tell
us
that
the
men
always
assured
the
medical
officers
that
they
had
everything
they
wanted
in
the
night
you
know
how
at
home
if
a
sick
man
wakes
up
and
is
alone
for
a
few
minutes
he
thinks
he
is
being
neglected
but
these
poor
chaps
must
have
many
lonely
hours
in
the
dark
tents
and
yet
they
never
complain
they
know
that
so
many
are
dying
of
enteric
and
they
seem
to
have
a
horror
of
being
sent
down
to
that
line
it
really
was
pretty
horrid
paddling
about
in
the
dark
and
the
long
grass
between
the
tents
and
it
was
so
slippery
with
mud
and
rain
that
twice
i
fell
down
and
it
took
some
time
before
i
could
find
my
lantern
and
the
kettle
which
i
had
just
boiled
up
and
was
carrying
down
to
make
a
poultice
for
a
poor
chap
with
pneumonia
it
was
very
annoying
as
of
course
it
took
time
to
reboil
the
kettle
the
day
sister
leaves
everything
ready
with
the
linseed
in
a
bowl
so
that
i
have
only
to
pour
the
water
on
and
then
i
put
everything
all
ready
for
the
next
one
in
this
way
we
can
get
fairly
hot
poultices
though
the
tents
are
a
long
way
from
the
fire
the
men
used
to
be
so
sorry
for
us
being
so
constantly
wet
and
many
a
convalescent
man
used
to
beg
me
to
let
him
stay
awake
with
a
man
who
was
very
ill
and
give
him
his
drinks
promising
to
come
and
fetch
me
if
he
wanted
anything
so
that
i
need
not
go
round
so
often
but
of
course
i
could
not
let
him
do
that
one
man
a
new
zealander
said
to
me
well
sister
i
have
often
grumbled
at
having
to
do
for
two
or
three
hours
on
a
wet
night
but
i
never
knew
that
any
woman
had
to
do
it
for
twelve
hours
at
a
stretch
i
sha
grumble
at
my
share
again
in
a
hurry
the
other
day
we
had
in
a
big
convoy
of
eighty
sick
and
wounded
from
general
french
column
they
had
been
eight
days
in
ox
waggons
coming
miles
poor
chaps
they
were
glad
to
get
into
beds
two
days
from
here
they
had
got
stuck
in
a
drift
one
night
and
the
boers
came
down
and
fired
on
them
killing
a
corporal
and
a
private
of
the
guard
and
wounding
two
others
one
man
had
been
shot
in
the
thigh
and
sister
made
him
comfortable
in
bed
and
the
doctor
said
they
should
not
do
anything
till
next
day
the
man
slept
like
a
top
for
over
twelve
hours
and
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
sister
said
something
to
him
about
having
been
comfortable
and
he
said
yes
sister
i
was
not
going
to
miss
five
minutes
enjoyment
of
that
bed
for
i
have
not
been
on
a
bed
for
fifteen
months
this
convoy
also
brought
in
a
lot
of
boer
women
and
children
but
they
have
gone
into
a
camp
about
three
miles
from
here
if
you
or
any
of
your
friends
care
to
post
me
any
illustrated
papers
or
magazines
they
would
be
most
gratefully
received
or
in
fact
anything
wherewith
to
amuse
the
men
we
should
be
very
glad
too
of
warm
garments
as
the
winter
is
coming
on
and
the
red
cross
people
have
stopped
sending
the
splendid
big
bundles
of
papers
that
our
men
used
to
appreciate
so
much
in
fact
most
people
seem
to
have
tired
of
sending
the
things
with
which
we
were
so
well
supplied
at
first
the
poor
tommies
feel
a
little
hurt
at
no
free
supplies
of
tobacco
or
cigarettes
and
i
would
give
anything
to
have
my
old
supply
of
warm
shirts
sweaters
wool
caps
for
the
men
who
have
to
go
back
to
roughing
it
on
trek
now
that
the
rain
has
stopped
we
are
having
perfectly
lovely
days
but
the
nights
are
very
cold
they
say
that
a
little
later
on
it
is
bitterly
cold
up
here
there
were
six
deaths
during
my
first
fortnight
on
night
duty
and
it
was
awfully
sad
as
one
felt
they
had
so
little
chance
and
i
can
not
really
see
why
they
should
not
be
better
done
by
but
the
sisters
seem
to
think
that
it
is
the
natural
order
of
things
and
that
we
must
just
do
our
best
and
leave
the
rest
the
general
was
here
the
other
day
and
said
that
all
the
men
were
to
have
tumblers
instead
of
mugs
but
i
suppose
he
does
not
know
that
they
have
not
each
got
a
mug
yet
there
is
one
enteric
tent
the
last
one
opened
of
fourteen
beds
and
their
equipment
includes
only
four
mugs
and
not
a
single
at
all
one
night
i
found
a
man
who
had
not
got
enteric
sent
there
for
the
sake
of
having
night
orderlies
as
he
was
very
ill
so
i
had
to
borrow
a
mug
for
him
from
another
line
and
the
next
day
i
bought
him
the
necessary
fittings
at
the
coolie
store
but
it
wo
do
much
good
as
the
orderlies
probably
wo
take
proper
precautions
to
wash
up
for
him
separately
there
are
some
new
officers
here
now
and
one
of
them
seems
energetic
i
do
know
what
had
gone
wrong
that
he
was
poking
into
but
one
of
the
sisters
heard
him
say
to
a
sergeant
hospital
scandals
are
not
in
it
so
we
can
only
hope
things
will
improve
here
there
was
much
excitement
here
one
night
a
major
arrived
sick
in
a
mule
buggy
from
a
column
near
here
the
saw
him
and
told
him
what
tent
to
go
to
but
he
never
arrived
after
much
searching
of
the
camp
neither
the
officer
nor
his
mules
could
be
found
then
the
heliograph
was
set
to
work
and
eventually
he
was
located
at
the
next
station
and
when
he
was
brought
back
he
said
the
was
so
rude
to
him
that
he
thought
he
would
not
stay
and
had
gone
to
a
hotel
since
i
came
off
night
duty
i
and
two
other
sisters
have
been
doing
only
afternoon
duty
which
means
looking
after
the
camp
while
all
the
other
sisters
are
off
duty
this
is
because
there
are
more
sisters
here
than
the
proper
number
if
there
were
only
the
right
number
two
of
the
sisters
who
have
lines
would
stay
on
every
afternoon
in
turn
but
the
stupid
thing
about
it
is
that
if
we
were
each
turned
on
to
a
big
tent
of
enterics
instead
of
one
sister
having
all
the
line
on
her
hands
we
might
be
doing
really
useful
nursing
as
it
is
there
is
not
much
to
do
in
the
afternoon
beyond
prowling
round
and
trying
to
talk
to
the
men
and
cheer
them
up
a
bit
the
other
day
one
of
them
presented
me
with
these
lines
of
his
own
composition
he
was
in
a
tent
when
i
was
on
night
duty
where
there
was
a
very
bad
case
an
australian
you
may
talk
of
our
soldiers
and
sailors
of
our
brave
colonials
too
but
nothing
is
thought
of
our
nurses
with
hearts
so
tender
and
true
they
have
suffered
great
hardships
and
endured
the
trials
that
fell
to
their
share
and
so
caused
their
names
to
be
cherished
on
every
barrack
room
square
so
give
three
cheers
for
our
sisters
who
shown
us
what
they
will
do
to
help
the
cause
of
old
england
by
nursing
our
sick
soldiers
through
xliv
general
hospital
natal
our
tent
has
filled
up
now
four
of
us
in
it
so
we
feel
rather
tightly
packed
one
of
the
four
is
a
sister
who
has
been
in
india
and
done
some
camping
out
so
she
thinks
she
knows
all
about
tents
and
how
to
live
in
them
we
rather
trade
on
this
and
when
it
rains
we
assure
her
she
ought
to
go
round
and
slack
the
in
case
they
should
shrink
with
the
wet
and
pull
the
pegs
up
as
she
knows
so
much
more
about
how
to
do
it
than
we
do
or
if
it
comes
on
to
blow
in
the
night
we
wake
her
up
and
offer
her
the
hammer
to
go
round
and
knock
in
the
the
wind
gets
up
so
suddenly
here
that
we
have
to
be
careful
not
to
leave
anything
about
that
is
not
tethered
or
it
may
be
miles
away
over
the
veldt
before
we
wake
up
i
now
have
charge
of
a
medical
line
of
tents
and
find
the
work
very
interesting
though
there
are
many
difficulties
to
contend
with
the
boers
seem
very
thick
in
the
country
round
they
have
captured
a
train
with
horses
between
here
and
and
the
other
day
they
took
head
of
cattle
from
a
loyal
farmer
only
about
six
miles
from
here
and
he
had
to
fly
for
protection
some
dragoons
who
have
been
scouring
the
country
for
some
weeks
were
through
here
the
other
day
and
one
of
their
poor
horses
fell
exhausted
near
to
my
tent
after
a
rest
they
got
him
up
and
went
on
but
soon
a
sergeant
returned
to
say
that
he
had
fallen
again
and
they
were
going
to
shoot
him
could
he
borrow
some
mules
and
tackle
to
pull
his
body
off
the
path
i
said
oh
do
shoot
him
i
badly
want
a
horse
and
i
get
him
some
gruel
and
brandy
from
the
store
he
said
i
might
have
him
if
i
would
look
after
him
or
else
get
him
shot
but
when
we
went
out
we
found
the
men
had
already
shot
the
poor
beast
there
are
so
many
dead
horses
mules
and
oxen
about
that
it
is
rather
horrid
walking
anywhere
beyond
the
camp
and
sometimes
we
hear
that
the
boers
have
put
a
dead
mule
and
once
we
heard
some
dead
kaffirs
into
our
water
supply
and
it
makes
us
rather
squeamish
as
we
ca
even
get
our
drinking
water
boiled
here
some
of
the
officer
patients
tell
us
that
they
have
drunk
nothing
but
boiled
water
all
through
the
campaign
until
they
came
here
and
now
they
ca
get
it
boiled
for
them
i
am
beginning
to
get
papers
from
home
and
they
are
much
appreciated
by
the
men
especially
the
six
numbers
of
the
that
come
each
week
i
take
one
to
each
of
my
tents
and
then
they
exchange
them
about
of
course
they
are
a
month
old
but
for
all
that
they
are
the
latest
news
and
heaps
of
men
from
other
lines
congregate
to
hear
them
read
after
much
trouble
i
have
retrieved
that
box
of
cushions
sent
by
the
queen
and
they
are
treasures
indeed
nice
big
feather
cushions
covered
in
red
twill
and
labelled
a
present
from
the
princess
of
wales
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
know
to
whom
to
give
them
as
of
course
all
the
men
wanted
one
i
am
trying
to
give
them
to
invalids
who
will
go
home
when
well
enough
as
they
will
be
very
useful
on
the
voyage
and
the
men
could
hardly
carry
them
with
them
on
trek
we
had
much
excitement
here
early
this
month
one
morning
we
were
awakened
at
by
the
sound
of
big
guns
and
in
the
course
of
time
we
heard
that
the
boers
had
blown
up
some
culverts
in
the
night
and
captured
a
provision
train
then
there
was
a
heliograph
message
to
say
heavy
fighting
since
daybreak
and
they
wanted
some
medical
officers
so
two
men
went
off
with
ambulances
but
it
seems
none
of
our
men
were
wounded
five
or
six
boers
were
killed
and
two
of
their
wounded
were
brought
here
one
poor
chap
with
a
shell
wound
of
the
head
is
not
likely
to
live
he
looked
just
a
rough
country
boy
in
corduroys
but
he
has
joubert
marked
on
a
handkerchief
so
he
may
be
some
relation
of
the
general
the
guard
of
the
train
had
a
rough
time
as
they
took
away
his
boots
and
then
made
him
carry
sacks
of
provisions
for
them
up
a
steep
kopje
for
the
present
they
have
stopped
the
trains
from
running
at
night
i
do
think
the
railway
men
have
been
awfully
plucky
in
sticking
to
their
work
when
they
could
never
feel
confident
that
the
line
was
not
mined
we
had
orders
not
to
go
outside
the
camp
for
some
days
and
the
went
round
and
took
notes
of
all
the
men
who
were
fit
to
take
a
rifle
if
there
was
an
attack
and
of
course
all
the
men
ride
about
armed
we
had
a
quiet
easter
day
here
the
sisters
were
expecting
some
officers
of
the
dragoons
over
to
tea
but
they
did
not
turn
up
as
they
had
been
out
all
night
chasing
boers
a
few
days
later
the
boers
burnt
a
hotel
and
stores
at
ingogo
and
some
troops
were
hurried
through
here
to
go
after
them
but
of
course
they
got
away
still
a
great
many
deaths
here
the
other
day
we
had
four
in
twenty
four
hours
one
of
those
who
died
was
a
doctor
whom
i
knew
slightly
he
travelled
up
the
coast
with
us
when
we
first
came
out
he
had
been
practising
out
here
so
his
wife
was
able
to
come
and
be
with
him
and
she
stayed
in
our
camp
the
poor
man
had
heart
disease
of
course
he
was
in
my
line
but
the
sister
of
the
officers
ward
had
a
case
in
the
theatre
and
as
he
had
been
asking
for
me
the
lady
superintendent
asked
me
if
i
would
go
to
sit
with
him
if
i
could
leave
my
line
for
a
bit
i
managed
to
be
with
him
most
of
the
day
and
he
died
in
the
evening
and
i
went
with
his
wife
to
the
funeral
the
next
day
the
enteric
line
is
now
full
so
one
of
my
tents
has
been
allowed
to
have
night
orderlies
and
we
collect
the
bad
cases
into
that
you
would
be
amused
at
a
kit
inspection
here
when
one
is
proclaimed
the
excitement
is
great
and
the
orderlies
almost
tearing
their
hair
are
so
distracted
that
if
the
sister
has
any
bad
cases
she
must
nurse
them
herself
or
understand
that
they
will
get
no
attention
till
the
inspection
is
over
all
the
ward
equipment
mugs
plates
buckets
brooms
has
to
be
laid
out
at
the
tent
door
for
the
officers
to
count
in
a
hospital
at
home
when
comes
you
know
that
anything
that
is
worn
out
or
damaged
or
really
lost
will
be
replaced
and
you
are
glad
of
the
chance
of
getting
things
made
correct
but
here
they
assure
me
that
things
must
correct
or
the
orderly
gets
fined
or
punished
so
to
avoid
this
he
resorts
to
strategy
as
soon
as
the
officer
with
the
wardmaster
and
orderly
in
attendance
has
passed
one
tent
as
correct
the
things
may
be
put
away
again
and
then
comes
in
the
help
of
the
patients
who
fully
enter
into
the
game
the
most
nimble
trotting
off
with
a
medicine
glass
to
one
orderly
who
is
short
of
that
or
a
bucket
to
another
i
have
known
a
good
broom
do
duty
for
three
different
lines
by
careful
dodging
about
i
find
one
of
the
senior
sisters
here
is
one
who
applied
to
me
when
i
was
choosing
sisters
to
bring
out
at
first
but
i
had
many
to
choose
from
and
i
made
no
mistake
in
thinking
others
more
suited
for
the
work
another
sister
who
come
out
with
me
has
recently
come
up
here
but
she
has
not
been
very
well
since
she
came
and
thinks
the
life
here
is
very
rough
so
she
is
trying
to
get
an
exchange
sisters
can
get
away
from
here
only
by
inducing
others
to
exchange
with
them
and
it
is
not
easy
to
make
any
one
believe
that
this
is
a
desirable
station
i
have
not
tried
yet
as
i
want
to
stick
to
it
if
i
can
of
course
i
ca
do
much
but
i
can
make
a
few
men
more
comfortable
but
most
of
the
others
are
trying
to
exchange
our
meat
chiefly
consists
of
trek
ox
and
it
is
so
tough
that
it
is
difficult
to
tackle
about
once
a
week
we
get
skinny
mutton
the
bread
is
all
right
but
several
times
lately
the
butter
has
not
arrived
and
we
have
to
do
without
we
buy
chocolates
and
biscuits
at
the
coolie
store
to
fill
up
the
cracks
the
other
day
we
had
in
a
sick
convoy
that
had
been
seven
days
on
the
road
and
one
poor
fellow
was
so
bad
with
dysentery
that
he
died
an
hour
after
they
lifted
him
out
of
the
ambulance
really
these
long
days
of
knocking
about
in
the
ambulances
seem
about
the
worst
of
the
hardships
that
the
poor
chaps
have
to
put
up
with
especially
for
the
very
sick
or
the
wounded
you
see
most
of
the
waggons
are
drawn
by
about
sixteen
mules
and
sometimes
they
trot
and
sometimes
they
walk
but
sometimes
they
turn
really
mulish
and
wo
budge
and
then
after
much
hauling
and
thrashing
and
shouting
they
start
with
a
great
bound
and
go
off
at
a
gallop
they
are
seldom
on
anything
that
you
could
call
a
road
and
are
much
more
frequently
on
the
rough
veldt
a
man
who
has
been
badly
wounded
can
tell
you
all
about
the
day
when
he
got
knocked
over
he
does
not
care
to
say
much
about
the
long
day
in
the
blazing
sun
when
he
lay
thirsty
where
he
fell
before
the
bearer
company
came
along
and
then
perhaps
the
dark
night
with
frost
on
the
ground
or
rain
falling
he
shudders
when
he
tells
you
of
the
groaning
men
who
lay
around
him
and
who
gradually
ceased
to
groan
and
how
he
began
to
think
the
ambulance
would
be
too
late
to
pick
him
up
too
but
what
he
simply
ca
bear
to
speak
about
is
the
agony
of
being
pitched
about
with
a
fractured
bone
for
days
in
one
of
those
waggons
it
is
not
so
bad
when
the
fighting
is
anywhere
near
the
rail
as
then
the
wounded
are
soon
placed
in
the
hospital
trains
and
are
fairly
comfortable
but
the
long
days
of
travelling
by
waggon
are
terrible
general
dartnell
column
was
through
here
the
other
day
and
they
have
gone
into
camp
about
two
miles
from
us
for
ten
days
rest
he
has
about
men
with
him
and
they
have
about
filled
us
up
with
sick
while
a
good
many
went
straight
on
board
a
hospital
train
major
of
the
bodyguard
was
with
this
column
and
came
over
to
see
me
his
wife
was
in
cape
town
when
i
was
last
there
and
went
home
on
the
you
know
how
particular
he
is
about
his
horses
at
home
he
drove
over
to
see
me
in
a
very
ramshackle
old
cape
cart
with
a
big
horse
running
as
a
pair
with
a
rough
little
boer
pony
his
uniform
was
in
rags
and
we
did
a
little
stitching
up
for
him
before
he
returned
they
are
having
a
very
rough
time
of
it
xlv
general
hospital
natal
there
have
been
some
big
ructions
here
lately
but
i
think
perhaps
they
may
have
done
good
in
some
ways
i
do
think
that
i
told
you
of
a
difficulty
with
which
i
had
to
wrestle
when
i
was
on
night
duty
and
which
bothered
me
a
good
deal
i
believe
it
is
a
general
rule
in
the
army
nursing
service
that
the
sisters
give
all
the
medicines
and
stimulants
and
of
course
i
expected
to
do
the
same
here
but
when
i
got
to
the
enteric
line
on
night
duty
i
found
that
the
day
sister
left
them
all
to
the
orderlies
to
give
in
the
daytime
and
the
night
orderlies
gave
them
in
the
night
generally
there
were
good
orderlies
there
who
were
quite
to
be
trusted
but
every
now
and
then
there
were
odd
men
on
and
of
course
i
could
not
be
sure
that
the
stimulants
were
correctly
given
the
day
sister
gave
me
no
report
of
what
the
men
were
on
but
it
was
given
to
the
orderly
i
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
but
i
went
to
the
lady
superintendent
after
seeing
the
sister
of
the
enteric
line
and
told
her
that
if
i
was
to
be
responsible
that
they
were
given
would
she
arrange
that
i
was
given
the
report
as
otherwise
i
could
not
tell
that
everything
was
given
as
directed
but
if
it
was
right
to
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
the
orderlies
i
would
to
see
that
it
was
all
right
but
would
not
be
responsible
if
anything
went
wrong
she
seemed
to
think
the
day
sister
would
not
have
time
to
give
all
herself
she
had
charge
of
only
the
one
line
whereas
the
night
sisters
each
had
five
or
six
lines
anyhow
she
did
not
do
anything
at
all
in
the
matter
so
i
just
muddled
on
as
best
i
could
and
used
always
to
try
to
be
around
when
important
medicines
were
due
so
that
i
do
much
was
neglected
then
last
month
another
night
sister
was
on
who
did
not
get
on
well
with
the
orderlies
and
she
reported
one
of
them
for
being
asleep
and
he
promptly
replied
by
reporting
her
for
not
doing
her
duty
and
giving
the
medicines
so
that
he
had
to
do
it
all
then
came
the
ructions
and
now
the
sisters
have
to
give
everything
and
i
believe
they
are
going
to
put
on
a
third
night
sister
so
i
think
things
will
go
more
smoothly
in
time
the
lady
superintendent
has
only
once
been
round
my
line
since
i
have
had
charge
of
it
i
had
a
curious
case
the
other
day
that
gave
us
a
good
deal
of
anxiety
that
of
a
young
who
had
been
bad
with
malaria
but
was
better
and
able
to
sit
up
in
bed
i
left
him
one
night
very
cheery
and
bright
and
the
next
morning
i
happened
to
meet
the
night
sister
as
she
went
off
duty
and
she
said
oh
sister
i
forgot
to
report
that
that
of
yours
in
tent
did
not
seem
so
well
and
he
was
sick
this
morning
i
thought
that
i
would
go
and
look
at
him
first
instead
of
beginning
my
round
in
tent
and
i
was
shocked
to
find
the
poor
boy
quite
unconscious
and
almost
pulseless
of
course
i
sent
for
the
doctor
and
got
brandy
hot
bottles
the
doctor
thought
it
was
all
up
but
he
injected
strychnine
he
said
he
thought
it
must
have
been
typhoid
and
not
malaria
and
that
this
meant
perforation
anyhow
the
boy
began
to
revive
i
hardly
left
him
all
day
but
now
i
think
i
may
say
he
is
out
of
danger
i
really
think
it
was
heart
trouble
perhaps
embolism
but
i
have
seldom
seen
a
man
pull
round
after
being
as
nearly
gone
as
he
was
of
course
you
will
have
heard
that
the
poor
old
the
ship
on
which
we
first
came
out
has
gone
down
on
robben
island
the
passengers
and
the
mails
were
saved
and
i
was
rejoiced
when
a
nice
soft
little
blanket
arrived
that
my
people
had
sent
out
by
her
i
roll
myself
in
it
inside
my
sheets
and
am
much
more
comfortable
it
is
a
curious
thing
that
so
many
ships
in
which
i
have
travelled
have
gone
to
the
bottom
i
made
one
trip
years
ago
up
the
coast
on
the
and
went
down
the
coast
on
the
i
also
went
home
from
tenerife
on
the
they
have
all
gone
down
and
now
the
has
shared
their
fate
there
was
a
big
dance
one
night
about
three
miles
from
here
to
which
twelve
of
the
sisters
went
and
another
night
there
were
some
theatricals
i
daresay
i
am
wrong
but
somehow
these
festivities
seem
a
little
out
of
place
while
the
war
is
still
going
on
some
of
the
sisters
appear
to
think
that
they
have
come
out
here
to
have
as
much
fun
as
they
can
get
and
they
talk
about
very
little
except
the
men
they
have
been
dancing
with
and
so
on
the
wind
has
been
tremendous
lately
and
four
of
the
patients
tents
have
been
blown
to
ribbons
we
seem
to
spend
most
of
our
time
on
duty
trying
to
keep
the
men
tents
up
with
not
more
of
the
gale
than
is
absolutely
necessary
blowing
round
the
bad
cases
and
most
of
our
time
off
duty
in
attending
to
our
own
of
course
wind
here
always
means
dust
and
sometimes
it
seems
as
though
the
stones
fly
up
and
hit
you
in
the
face
and
unless
one
takes
great
care
the
milk
is
soon
full
of
sand
really
if
it
was
not
that
the
men
suffered
for
them
some
of
our
difficulties
would
be
amusing
when
this
hospital
was
a
field
stationary
all
the
men
had
warm
grey
flannel
shirts
when
it
became
a
general
they
were
given
instead
white
cotton
shirts
and
white
flannel
vests
that
was
all
right
at
first
but
recently
the
hospital
has
been
enlarged
and
though
there
are
plenty
of
the
cotton
shirts
they
have
run
out
of
the
flannel
vests
now
the
winter
has
begun
and
we
have
many
men
in
with
rheumatism
and
chest
complaints
and
the
tents
are
very
cold
but
the
poor
chaps
are
only
given
cotton
shirts
i
know
there
are
plenty
of
the
old
greybacks
in
the
store
but
because
this
is
now
called
a
general
hospital
they
are
not
correct
and
so
can
not
be
issued
and
the
men
must
wait
till
more
vests
arrive
we
have
all
fussed
about
it
as
much
as
we
could
and
we
bought
flannel
shirts
at
the
store
for
our
worst
cases
a
man
is
always
most
grateful
for
an
extra
shirt
to
take
with
him
when
he
goes
away
so
they
wo
be
wasted
and
now
at
last
the
old
greybacks
have
been
dealt
out
at
last
they
have
got
some
boilers
on
wheels
so
that
we
can
get
hot
water
in
the
tents
but
should
we
have
to
wrestle
so
long
to
get
things
that
make
so
much
difference
to
the
health
and
the
comfort
of
the
men
the
lady
superintendent
is
always
saying
that
she
does
not
know
how
we
should
have
done
in
ladysmith
but
we
all
reply
that
we
should
have
tried
to
make
shift
but
we
ca
see
why
we
should
have
to
make
shift
here
quite
so
much
with
an
open
line
to
the
base
i
do
wonder
when
the
war
will
be
over
the
poor
tommies
are
so
heartily
sick
of
it
and
are
beginning
to
try
every
means
to
get
sent
home
you
see
most
of
the
excitement
of
war
has
pretty
well
worn
off
and
now
they
just
have
to
keep
on
trekking
about
the
country
destroying
farms
and
bringing
in
boer
women
and
children
to
the
refugee
camps
they
generally
collect
more
destitute
people
on
the
way
than
they
reckoned
for
and
as
they
have
to
feed
them
the
rations
for
the
troops
run
short
and
the
men
are
cut
down
to
half
rations
and
sometimes
quarter
rations
and
some
columns
out
this
way
have
had
nothing
but
mealie
meal
indian
corn
and
not
too
much
of
that
for
some
days
before
they
got
into
camp
sometimes
they
have
been
on
such
short
rations
that
men
have
had
to
be
punished
for
stealing
their
horses
rations
of
mealie
meal
when
they
pass
through
a
village
the
first
place
they
make
for
is
the
baker
shop
and
it
is
very
soon
cleared
and
you
see
the
men
going
on
with
loaves
slung
around
them
and
rather
in
the
way
of
their
rifles
when
you
consider
that
they
are
generally
marching
all
day
in
a
hot
sun
and
that
in
summer
the
nights
are
often
wet
and
in
winter
they
are
generally
frosty
and
the
men
just
have
to
lie
down
hungry
on
their
mackintosh
sheet
no
tents
with
their
greatcoat
and
sometimes
one
blanket
that
they
hardly
ever
have
a
chance
of
shooting
at
a
boer
but
are
constantly
being
sniped
at
during
the
nights
is
it
any
wonder
that
they
are
utterly
weary
of
it
all
we
have
not
heard
so
much
about
boers
being
close
around
here
since
general
dartnell
column
went
through
and
now
the
sisters
are
generally
allowed
to
ride
again
our
tent
is
the
last
one
at
this
end
of
the
camp
and
when
we
were
told
that
we
were
not
to
go
more
than
a
mile
from
the
camp
in
any
direction
except
along
the
line
it
used
to
be
strange
to
walk
out
after
we
came
off
duty
for
a
few
hundred
yards
beyond
my
tent
and
then
sit
down
on
a
grassy
ridge
as
it
got
dark
and
watch
the
heliographs
flashing
around
and
wonder
whether
the
little
lights
we
saw
meant
our
men
or
boers
camping
out
sometimes
we
used
to
imagine
they
were
quite
close
and
watching
us
and
used
to
go
back
to
our
tents
feeling
quite
creepy
and
borrowing
an
extra
piece
of
string
to
tie
up
our
tent
door
and
then
when
we
heard
the
guns
in
the
distance
it
was
always
a
debatable
point
whether
it
was
worth
getting
up
and
dressing
in
case
any
wounded
were
brought
in
soon
but
we
generally
decided
to
finish
our
usual
allowance
of
hours
in
bed
people
are
kindly
sending
me
english
papers
now
both
from
england
and
passed
on
from
durban
and
they
are
very
much
enjoyed
the
men
were
especially
delighted
last
week
when
they
got
hold
of
an
old
weekly
edition
of
in
which
general
buller
and
general
roberts
mentioned
some
of
the
regiments
to
which
they
belonged
it
is
getting
frightfully
cold
at
nights
there
are
big
icicles
hanging
round
the
water
tanks
and
when
one
of
them
overflowed
there
was
quite
a
little
sea
of
ice
round
it
the
water
in
our
tents
often
freezes
and
it
is
quite
difficult
to
break
it
to
wash
in
the
morning
the
night
sisters
are
very
miserable
with
the
cold
i
shall
have
to
take
my
turn
on
night
again
next
month
and
i
shall
be
quite
sorry
to
give
up
my
line
as
the
patients
are
so
awfully
grateful
for
what
one
can
do
for
them
and
i
have
nice
orderlies
just
now
we
go
to
bed
directly
we
finish
dinner
at
night
so
as
to
try
to
get
warm
xlvi
general
hospital
natal
thank
goodness
the
winter
will
soon
be
over
i
have
never
felt
anything
like
the
keenness
of
the
cold
up
here
on
the
whole
things
have
been
fairly
quiet
in
the
country
round
just
lately
though
once
the
line
was
threatened
and
some
of
the
trains
delayed
and
on
another
day
there
was
a
rumour
of
fighting
not
far
off
and
it
was
said
that
we
had
lost
some
guns
but
i
do
think
there
was
much
truth
in
the
report
things
are
also
going
a
little
better
in
the
hospital
we
have
a
new
lady
superintendent
the
other
having
gone
home
on
a
hospital
ship
there
has
been
another
big
dance
to
which
most
of
the
sisters
went
and
some
other
entertainments
one
night
we
my
tent
full
had
all
gone
to
bed
to
try
to
get
warm
when
some
one
came
banging
on
the
canvas
and
sister
of
the
hospital
train
put
her
head
in
you
know
she
was
an
old
london
friend
of
mine
her
train
was
tied
up
here
for
the
night
and
as
she
had
heard
our
men
were
suffering
from
the
cold
she
had
brought
up
a
noble
present
of
flannel
jackets
for
them
they
really
were
treasures
of
course
i
wanted
them
all
for
my
own
line
but
had
to
be
generous
and
give
up
a
few
to
sisters
who
really
had
some
bad
chest
and
rheumatism
patients
talking
about
rheumatism
i
had
one
man
in
with
rheumatism
who
was
rather
bad
at
first
he
would
not
improve
but
remained
so
helpless
that
the
orderly
had
to
lift
him
about
i
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
with
him
and
began
to
think
that
if
an
surgeon
had
been
on
my
line
the
improvement
would
have
been
rather
more
rapid
than
with
the
civil
surgeon
who
had
charge
then
one
day
i
had
a
man
bad
in
the
next
tent
to
this
man
so
i
asked
leave
to
go
down
to
do
something
for
him
one
evening
after
we
had
gone
off
duty
as
i
knew
the
night
sister
would
be
too
busy
to
go
to
him
when
she
first
went
on
and
here
there
is
always
an
hour
interval
after
the
day
sisters
leave
the
camp
and
before
the
night
sisters
go
down
what
was
my
surprise
when
i
got
to
the
tent
to
find
my
rheumatic
patient
in
there
playing
cards
he
had
pretended
he
could
not
sit
up
in
bed
i
only
said
to
him
that
i
thought
it
was
time
he
turned
in
for
the
night
and
the
next
day
i
handed
his
board
to
the
medical
officer
when
he
came
round
and
said
that
if
he
did
not
mind
marking
him
up
i
thought
it
would
do
him
good
to
sit
out
in
the
sun
in
the
middle
of
the
day
if
the
orderly
put
him
to
bed
after
tea
you
can
imagine
the
poor
man
felt
pretty
small
and
in
a
few
days
he
told
the
civil
surgeon
that
he
thought
he
felt
fit
to
go
back
to
duty
so
we
shook
hands
and
parted
good
friends
i
hope
that
he
will
not
get
shot
or
i
shall
wish
i
had
let
him
slack
a
bit
longer
we
have
had
a
good
many
boer
patients
in
lately
one
poor
young
captain
has
lost
his
leg
one
old
fellow
used
to
crawl
about
on
crutches
but
he
was
caught
one
night
slipping
about
without
them
and
a
boer
woman
was
found
outside
the
fence
with
his
clothes
so
now
all
the
boers
have
been
collected
together
and
a
guard
posted
i
am
now
on
night
duty
again
and
find
the
orderlies
more
attentive
and
the
patients
generally
better
nursed
the
first
night
i
was
on
duty
i
was
just
reading
the
reports
and
trying
to
find
out
where
the
worst
cases
were
so
as
to
visit
them
first
i
now
have
beds
on
my
side
instead
of
the
i
had
when
i
was
on
before
when
a
wardmaster
came
to
tell
me
that
a
sick
convoy
had
turned
up
unexpectedly
from
general
bullock
column
and
one
man
had
been
wounded
on
the
way
and
had
some
h√¶morrhage
from
a
shattered
hand
i
helped
the
surgical
sister
get
the
theatre
ready
in
a
hurry
and
then
she
stayed
for
the
operation
while
i
went
to
see
the
others
there
were
only
fifteen
men
and
they
were
black
as
sweeps
and
very
cold
but
they
did
not
seem
very
bad
and
they
were
delighted
to
be
in
shelter
with
the
prospect
of
a
bed
the
orderly
officer
asked
me
to
give
them
anything
i
liked
and
he
would
order
it
afterwards
while
he
went
to
the
theatre
with
the
case
the
wardmaster
got
them
all
some
bovril
and
we
soon
settled
which
of
them
might
have
bread
with
it
and
then
i
had
not
the
heart
to
insist
on
the
usual
wash
as
it
was
so
bitterly
cold
but
i
let
them
all
tumble
into
beds
and
then
took
round
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
a
kettle
and
gave
them
all
a
hot
drink
there
was
nothing
more
heard
of
that
lot
of
men
but
snores
for
a
good
many
hours
poor
chaps
they
were
absolutely
tired
out
and
the
medical
officer
quite
approved
only
saying
he
thought
they
might
have
had
two
bottles
of
whisky
amongst
them
instead
of
one
but
you
know
i
am
a
strict
teetotaller
having
settled
them
i
started
my
rounds
and
soon
found
that
the
worst
case
was
a
poor
chap
with
pneumonia
fortunately
he
was
in
a
building
instead
of
a
tent
so
it
was
possible
to
keep
him
fairly
warm
the
night
orderly
was
not
a
very
intelligent
youth
but
he
was
fairly
watchful
and
obedient
and
for
four
nights
i
spent
every
spare
minute
with
this
man
and
really
thought
we
should
pull
him
through
then
the
fifth
night
the
day
sister
met
me
in
a
very
bad
temper
and
said
what
you
think
they
have
moved
our
poor
down
to
a
very
draughty
enteric
tent
after
all
the
trouble
we
have
taken
to
pull
him
round
i
am
sure
he
will
die
there
i
asked
why
he
had
been
moved
as
there
had
been
no
sign
of
enteric
and
she
replied
that
she
could
not
get
any
reason
but
an
orderly
had
told
her
that
the
doctor
said
that
he
was
going
to
die
and
he
did
not
want
any
death
up
there
poor
chap
he
did
die
the
next
day
and
of
course
he
have
done
so
in
any
case
but
to
shift
him
then
just
took
away
his
only
chance
it
has
been
very
cold
all
the
time
that
i
have
been
on
night
duty
but
two
of
the
nights
were
so
horrible
that
i
do
think
i
shall
ever
forget
them
sister
is
on
with
me
now
so
we
grumble
together
for
those
two
nights
it
was
blowing
and
then
a
sleety
rain
came
on
that
positively
cut
like
knives
and
was
almost
paralysing
on
the
second
of
those
two
nights
i
struggled
back
to
the
duty
room
and
flopped
down
by
the
fire
which
was
very
low
but
i
had
not
even
the
energy
to
poke
it
up
after
a
bit
sister
came
in
dripping
wet
and
looking
blue
with
cold
she
set
down
her
lantern
and
then
came
to
the
fire
and
gazed
at
me
and
after
a
bit
said
sister
you
do
look
i
tried
to
laugh
but
i
think
we
were
both
much
nearer
crying
with
cold
so
i
struggled
up
to
attend
to
the
fire
and
brewed
some
tea
and
after
a
bit
sister
said
do
you
know
sister
when
i
came
in
i
thought
you
looked
as
though
you
were
going
to
die
and
if
you
had
been
i
positively
had
not
the
power
to
set
to
work
to
get
you
a
hot
drink
or
anything
i
told
her
i
thought
we
were
both
too
tough
to
die
of
cold
and
then
we
both
feeling
a
little
better
for
the
tea
and
warmth
had
to
tramp
off
again
to
give
brandy
to
some
of
the
bad
cases
after
that
they
put
on
another
night
sister
so
the
work
was
not
quite
so
hard
and
we
could
take
rather
longer
spells
in
the
duty
room
to
get
warm
but
we
have
not
had
rain
as
well
as
the
cold
except
on
those
two
nights
last
night
was
full
of
excitement
during
the
day
a
poor
young
australian
lad
had
gone
off
his
head
and
had
been
put
in
a
guard
tent
and
he
tried
to
get
hold
of
the
sentry
bayonet
then
there
was
much
commotion
because
the
found
one
of
the
signalmen
was
drunk
and
brought
him
down
to
the
guard
tent
then
sister
found
an
orderly
straying
about
who
was
supposed
to
be
special
with
a
young
lieutenant
who
is
down
with
fever
and
the
orderly
did
not
seem
to
know
what
he
wanted
so
sister
flew
off
to
the
tent
and
found
the
lieutenant
very
much
upset
and
saying
that
the
orderly
was
quite
mad
and
had
refused
to
go
and
fetch
the
wardmaster
when
he
ordered
him
to
do
so
he
said
he
could
not
tell
sister
what
mad
things
the
orderly
had
been
doing
so
she
had
to
send
for
the
medical
officer
who
got
the
orderly
removed
at
once
and
another
posted
there
is
not
nearly
so
much
drinking
as
there
was
at
first
but
still
they
do
find
ways
of
getting
drunk
at
times
a
little
while
ago
there
was
a
great
row
because
the
convalescent
officers
were
allowed
to
drive
or
ride
about
and
they
used
to
go
over
to
the
next
town
and
bring
back
whisky
and
champagne
i
do
think
there
was
much
harm
in
it
at
first
except
that
it
was
a
bad
example
for
the
men
and
it
was
winked
at
for
some
time
until
they
had
a
very
rowdy
lot
of
men
in
and
then
one
day
one
of
them
was
found
to
be
suffering
from
i
am
glad
i
am
not
lady
superintendent
up
here
i
should
find
it
hard
to
know
where
to
draw
the
line
with
the
present
lot
of
sisters
at
first
they
were
given
every
liberty
and
were
rather
encouraged
to
go
to
dances
and
riding
picnics
with
the
men
then
when
their
behaviour
began
to
be
talked
about
the
authorities
put
up
notices
in
our
of
rules
referring
to
conduct
of
which
no
lady
would
be
guilty
rules
which
were
in
fact
an
insult
to
us
but
which
we
can
not
say
are
unnecessary
because
there
are
just
a
few
sisters
who
do
care
what
they
do
one
of
them
was
seen
at
a
hotel
at
the
next
station
smoking
cigarettes
with
a
most
undesirable
companion
we
can
only
hope
the
war
will
soon
be
over
and
let
us
all
go
home
otherwise
the
sooner
sisters
of
that
sort
are
weeded
out
the
better
they
seem
to
have
been
choosing
the
sisters
in
a
very
casual
way
at
home
lately
and
though
there
are
plenty
of
sisters
out
here
who
are
working
hard
and
well
they
will
probably
all
get
classed
together
in
the
public
estimation
with
those
who
are
simply
frivolling
and
getting
themselves
talked
about
xlvii
uitenhage
cape
colony
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
written
to
you
but
for
some
time
things
went
jogging
on
very
much
the
same
as
when
i
wrote
last
and
there
was
little
to
write
about
and
then
lately
i
have
had
a
wretched
time
of
it
so
did
not
feel
inclined
for
writing
after
i
finished
my
turn
on
night
duty
i
went
back
to
my
line
but
soon
knocked
up
and
was
ill
and
off
duty
for
nearly
three
weeks
first
with
dysentery
and
then
my
damaged
side
got
bad
again
by
the
time
i
got
to
work
once
more
the
weather
had
very
much
improved
and
my
tents
were
very
light
i
received
from
home
some
splendid
boxes
of
literature
and
also
of
tobacco
and
jerseys
and
some
games
for
the
men
i
taught
them
to
play
halma
and
it
was
very
popular
they
used
to
make
out
it
was
a
competition
between
the
different
branches
of
the
service
the
greens
were
always
the
volunteers
the
yellows
were
the
yeomanry
the
reds
the
regulars
and
the
blues
the
navy
or
the
colonials
sometimes
they
could
get
a
representative
of
each
branch
to
play
the
men
and
then
there
was
much
excitement
as
to
which
would
get
in
first
the
men
in
my
line
got
a
photographer
to
photograph
them
and
presented
me
with
a
large
copy
you
can
understand
that
we
were
fairly
slack
when
i
tell
you
that
we
used
to
brew
toffee
in
the
duty
room
on
afternoon
duty
i
think
we
were
all
very
tired
of
ration
feeding
and
we
were
all
getting
thin
and
when
one
gets
to
that
stage
one
has
a
sort
of
craving
for
sweet
things
so
the
toffee
was
very
popular
something
went
wrong
with
the
washing
arrangements
for
a
time
and
we
could
not
get
our
things
washed
so
for
a
week
or
two
we
had
to
wash
for
ourselves
and
irons
being
very
scarce
we
had
to
press
our
things
by
putting
them
under
our
mattresses
and
sleeping
on
them
a
column
camped
for
a
night
near
to
us
and
sent
us
in
some
sick
including
a
good
many
cases
of
measles
that
had
to
be
sent
to
an
isolation
camp
they
had
no
sisters
out
there
and
it
was
pretty
rough
and
very
dull
but
the
provision
cart
went
out
every
day
so
i
was
often
able
to
send
them
parcels
of
papers
early
in
september
the
town
guard
were
all
under
arms
as
there
was
some
looting
of
stock
quite
near
to
us
and
there
were
many
rumours
that
we
were
going
to
be
attacked
for
the
sake
of
the
rifles
and
ammunition
that
the
patients
had
brought
in
the
rifles
were
therefore
sent
to
the
next
station
after
that
there
was
more
fighting
down
at
dundee
and
then
the
natal
volunteers
were
ordered
out
again
all
this
time
i
was
very
seedy
and
trying
to
exchange
to
another
station
but
several
of
us
had
rather
good
reason
to
believe
that
so
many
sisters
having
sent
in
for
an
exchange
their
applications
were
never
forwarded
to
the
then
they
had
a
court
of
inquiry
at
the
hospital
and
i
was
obliged
to
give
some
evidence
and
it
was
simply
horrid
having
to
do
so
after
that
i
felt
so
bad
i
wrote
to
the
direct
to
say
that
as
i
could
not
get
an
exchange
might
i
be
allowed
to
resign
as
my
brother
was
just
now
in
natal
and
i
proposed
to
go
to
stay
with
him
before
going
to
england
at
last
i
obtained
leave
of
absence
and
later
on
obtained
leave
to
resign
much
to
my
surprise
about
this
time
i
learnt
that
i
had
been
mentioned
in
despatches
and
a
little
later
on
that
i
had
been
awarded
the
royal
red
cross
i
am
sure
i
have
not
done
anything
to
earn
it
nor
have
i
done
as
much
as
many
of
the
others
but
of
course
it
is
very
nice
all
the
same
i
had
such
an
awfully
kind
letter
of
farewell
from
the
men
of
my
line
before
i
left
thanking
me
for
what
i
had
done
for
them
we
had
a
good
many
gentlemen
troopers
in
the
last
part
of
my
time
and
some
exceedingly
nice
fellows
amongst
them
one
who
was
especially
helpful
had
been
an
officer
on
one
of
the
big
liners
that
came
out
here
before
the
war
he
is
now
a
gunner
on
one
of
the
armoured
trains
and
has
had
a
very
exciting
time
of
it
my
brother
was
in
durban
so
i
left
one
morning
at
to
join
him
i
put
myself
to
bed
in
the
train
the
night
before
but
i
was
prevented
from
sleeping
by
the
shunting
of
engines
and
by
the
letting
off
of
steam
i
was
the
only
lady
on
the
train
till
we
had
got
some
way
down
the
line
we
were
delayed
for
an
hour
soon
after
we
had
started
as
there
had
been
a
bad
collision
the
day
before
and
as
the
telegraph
line
was
damaged
they
had
to
give
us
a
pilot
engine
it
was
a
very
rough
line
and
the
train
swayed
about
so
tremendously
that
i
was
feeling
quite
then
when
we
were
rattling
down
a
steep
hill
there
was
a
sudden
explosion
which
of
course
made
us
think
of
boers
and
many
things
and
we
pulled
up
with
such
terrific
jerks
that
we
and
our
baggage
all
became
mixed
up
on
the
floor
as
soon
as
we
could
disentangle
ourselves
we
looked
out
quite
expecting
to
see
a
party
of
boers
but
only
saw
one
man
waving
his
arms
violently
and
we
came
to
a
standstill
just
as
we
rounded
a
sharp
curve
and
found
ourselves
immediately
on
the
tail
of
a
heavy
coal
train
that
had
got
stuck
on
our
line
the
explosion
was
a
fog
signal
they
had
laid
to
stop
us
and
it
saved
us
from
coming
a
very
nasty
cropper
down
a
steep
bank
i
had
told
my
brother
i
should
spend
the
night
with
friends
at
pinetown
and
join
him
in
durban
the
next
day
but
when
i
was
leaving
i
had
a
wire
from
him
to
say
i
had
better
come
straight
down
as
he
might
have
to
sail
the
next
day
so
i
wired
to
my
friends
not
to
expect
me
i
had
a
very
early
breakfast
at
glencoe
and
the
usual
wash
at
a
tap
on
the
platform
and
we
were
so
late
in
reaching
estcourt
where
we
were
supposed
to
lunch
that
by
that
time
i
had
a
really
bad
headache
and
could
only
rise
to
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
roll
inchanga
is
the
place
where
one
always
dines
whether
going
up
or
down
and
we
were
due
there
about
but
about
we
got
stuck
in
a
siding
about
a
mile
from
inchanga
and
there
we
had
to
remain
nearly
an
hour
because
lord
milner
was
dining
at
inchanga
and
we
had
to
wait
till
he
had
passed
we
did
not
bless
him
for
taking
so
long
over
his
dinner
while
we
starved
by
this
time
i
was
feeling
really
ill
and
thought
it
might
be
partly
from
want
of
food
so
i
made
myself
eat
some
soup
and
a
little
chicken
then
i
was
establishing
myself
in
the
train
again
thankful
to
think
that
it
was
a
no
stop
run
to
durban
when
another
wire
was
thrust
into
my
hand
from
my
brother
saying
no
beds
if
possible
sleep
pinetown
not
leaving
till
following
day
i
groaned
but
bundled
out
again
with
my
open
and
my
rugs
pillow
books
all
loose
just
as
the
train
departed
i
thrust
my
goods
into
the
hands
of
an
astonished
little
kaffir
boy
who
helped
me
to
pack
up
my
and
of
course
i
had
to
leave
my
heavy
baggage
to
take
care
of
itself
i
did
not
have
to
wait
long
for
the
kaffir
mail
which
stop
at
pinetown
but
i
knew
my
friends
would
all
have
gone
to
bed
as
they
were
not
expecting
me
and
of
course
no
one
would
meet
the
train
and
their
house
was
some
way
from
the
station
and
it
was
raining
steadily
so
i
felt
pretty
miserable
i
was
put
in
a
carriage
by
myself
and
after
we
had
started
found
there
was
no
light
in
it
and
i
felt
really
ill
and
wished
i
had
not
made
myself
eat
any
dinner
however
just
as
we
ran
into
pinetown
i
looked
out
and
some
one
hailed
me
and
there
was
one
of
my
best
old
pinetown
orderlies
now
working
on
the
line
he
seemed
so
pleased
to
see
me
that
i
felt
inclined
to
embrace
him
but
refrained
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
the
train
off
and
had
locked
up
the
station
he
shouldered
my
bag
and
escorted
me
to
my
friend
house
they
were
all
fast
asleep
but
soon
let
me
in
and
i
do
know
when
i
have
been
so
thankful
to
turn
into
a
comfortable
bed
as
i
was
that
night
it
was
a
little
over
eight
months
since
i
had
slept
in
a
house
the
next
morning
they
brought
me
a
delicious
breakfast
in
bed
hot
scones
you
do
know
what
it
was
like
after
camp
feeding
to
have
a
pretty
tray
with
a
cloth
on
it
and
everything
dainty
and
nice
and
i
was
very
loth
to
leave
both
my
bed
and
my
kind
friends
but
about
i
again
boarded
the
train
for
durban
retrieved
my
baggage
at
the
station
and
then
found
my
brother
at
the
marine
hotel
i
had
time
to
see
a
few
friends
and
do
a
little
very
necessary
shopping
and
then
we
went
on
board
the
to
go
down
the
coast
to
port
elizabeth
you
ca
think
how
funny
it
was
to
walk
upstairs
again
the
pinetown
house
was
a
bungalow
so
i
did
not
have
to
try
stairs
till
i
got
on
board
ship
i
still
feel
as
though
i
must
duck
my
head
every
time
i
go
through
a
door
and
when
it
blows
in
the
night
i
always
wake
up
and
wonder
whether
i
ought
to
take
the
mallet
and
attend
to
the
and
then
when
i
realise
i
am
not
under
canvas
there
is
such
a
satisfaction
in
being
able
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
again
we
did
not
stay
in
port
elizabeth
but
travelled
by
train
straight
on
here
where
my
brother
has
about
three
days
work
we
have
a
very
comfortable
little
house
to
ourselves
with
a
garden
full
of
such
lovely
flowers
mar√©chal
niel
roses
this
is
a
pretty
little
town
and
many
of
the
people
who
are
most
pleasant
and
friendly
have
called
on
me
near
to
uitenhage
there
are
still
some
wild
elephants
but
i
had
not
time
to
make
their
acquaintance
the
minister
of
the
dutch
reformed
church
took
us
to
see
the
riebeck
girls
college
such
good
buildings
and
such
scholars
they
have
a
kindergarten
and
then
all
the
standards
up
to
the
highest
those
working
for
university
exams
the
resident
magistrate
took
us
to
see
some
nursery
gardens
that
send
flowers
all
over
south
africa
after
the
barrenness
of
the
natal
uplands
these
masses
of
flowers
were
quite
lovely
and
i
was
given
a
beautiful
bunch
of
carnations
we
have
some
people
dining
with
us
and
we
return
to
port
elizabeth
where
we
shall
probably
stay
about
ten
days
xlviii
kimberley
south
africa
from
uitenhage
we
returned
to
port
elizabeth
where
my
brother
had
about
a
week
work
and
then
we
had
to
wait
a
few
more
days
for
a
steamer
but
several
old
kimberley
friends
were
down
there
and
a
good
many
other
people
called
so
i
had
a
very
pleasant
time
port
elizabeth
was
a
little
agitated
about
the
plague
they
had
had
about
a
hundred
cases
and
about
half
of
that
number
had
died
but
just
then
there
were
only
twelve
in
the
hospital
one
day
i
went
out
with
three
ladies
to
a
place
they
call
the
red
house
and
had
a
delightful
row
up
the
zwartkops
river
another
day
drove
my
brother
and
me
out
to
her
father
country
house
kraggakama
about
a
fourteen
mile
drive
a
beautiful
bungalow
house
and
such
a
lovely
garden
surrounded
by
dense
woods
with
little
paths
leading
away
into
the
woods
many
monkeys
and
other
creatures
around
we
had
lunch
out
there
and
found
strawberries
just
ripe
in
the
garden
from
port
elizabeth
we
had
meant
to
go
straight
back
to
kimberley
but
after
many
wires
it
was
decided
that
my
brother
must
go
to
oudtshoorn
a
place
a
long
way
from
the
railway
where
there
had
been
cases
waiting
for
a
long
time
for
trial
as
it
had
not
been
considered
safe
for
a
judge
to
travel
there
to
reach
oudtshoorn
it
was
necessary
to
go
by
steamer
to
mossel
bay
and
the
mail
steamers
as
a
rule
do
not
call
at
mossel
bay
moreover
port
elizabeth
being
an
infected
port
with
plague
the
mail
steamers
were
not
keen
on
taking
passengers
from
there
so
there
were
many
obstacles
to
be
overcome
i
packed
up
my
heavy
baggage
and
sent
it
up
to
kimberley
then
the
was
signalled
and
we
went
down
to
the
jetty
and
had
to
be
examined
by
the
medical
officer
of
health
for
plague
symptoms
and
then
the
took
us
off
in
a
special
tug
the
next
morning
they
put
us
ashore
at
mossel
bay
and
there
we
had
to
wait
some
hours
as
the
commandant
was
very
doubtful
as
to
which
was
the
safest
route
for
us
to
take
there
were
still
a
good
many
boers
in
the
surrounding
country
and
though
they
probably
would
not
wish
to
interfere
with
us
they
would
certainly
be
very
pleased
to
annex
our
provision
cart
and
also
our
horses
and
mules
and
the
had
so
weak
a
garrison
that
he
could
spare
us
only
a
small
escort
after
some
time
spent
in
wiring
it
was
decided
we
should
drive
to
george
and
sleep
there
the
baggage
and
provisions
were
sent
on
with
a
mule
cart
and
after
an
early
lunch
we
got
away
in
two
cape
carts
with
four
horses
each
the
distance
was
about
thirty
miles
and
we
outspanned
only
once
at
brak
river
where
we
had
some
tea
and
there
an
escort
of
six
cyclists
met
us
from
george
and
the
mossel
bay
men
turned
back
the
cyclists
were
very
smart
fellows
some
of
them
scouted
ahead
and
the
others
rode
with
us
very
steadily
uphill
and
down
it
was
getting
dark
when
we
neared
george
and
the
commandant
and
magistrate
rode
out
to
meet
us
and
then
stayed
and
had
dinner
with
us
at
the
hotel
george
is
a
pretty
place
with
streets
lined
with
fine
old
oaks
and
with
big
arum
lilies
growing
in
the
fields
around
just
in
front
of
the
hotel
there
was
a
stout
little
sandbag
fort
with
a
small
gun
and
of
course
there
was
very
strict
martial
law
there
pickets
on
every
road
and
no
one
could
leave
the
village
or
come
in
without
a
permit
and
even
with
a
permit
you
must
be
within
the
picket
lines
by
sundown
no
one
might
be
outside
his
house
after
and
lights
must
be
all
out
by
we
were
to
sleep
at
george
and
the
commandant
told
us
that
he
had
already
sent
out
a
patrol
of
men
who
were
to
sleep
at
the
top
of
the
montague
pass
and
meet
us
there
the
next
morning
he
wished
us
to
slip
away
quietly
in
the
early
morning
and
his
patrol
would
soon
join
us
and
ride
with
us
till
we
met
the
troop
that
was
being
sent
out
from
oudtshoorn
to
meet
us
the
commandant
has
about
men
under
him
they
are
nearly
all
local
men
in
fact
many
of
them
boers
but
he
was
quite
confident
of
their
loyalty
and
said
the
poor
chaps
were
suffering
badly
for
it
the
rebels
burning
their
farms
and
doing
them
all
the
harm
they
possibly
could
just
when
we
were
there
he
was
very
sad
because
one
of
his
scouts
quite
a
young
lad
belonging
to
george
and
very
popular
in
the
place
had
been
most
cruelly
shot
by
them
after
he
had
had
to
surrender
the
next
day
we
started
in
our
carts
about
every
one
seeming
to
think
it
would
be
a
risky
drive
after
we
had
gone
some
way
our
driver
began
to
pull
up
and
looked
scared
he
could
speak
only
dutch
and
we
made
out
that
he
could
see
some
horses
higher
up
the
mountain
and
he
thought
it
was
boers
waiting
for
us
with
some
difficulty
we
explained
to
him
that
we
expected
the
george
escort
to
meet
us
at
the
beginning
of
the
pass
and
then
he
agreed
to
go
on
but
we
were
all
somewhat
relieved
when
we
got
up
to
the
horses
and
found
they
belonged
to
genuine
district
mounted
troops
and
that
they
had
not
seen
any
boers
about
that
day
we
travelled
between
forty
and
fifty
miles
through
beautiful
mountain
scenery
which
reminded
us
of
switzerland
minus
the
snow
lovely
ferns
and
cool
dripping
water
and
quite
high
mountains
all
round
we
outspanned
only
once
for
a
at
doom
river
about
scheeper
commando
had
honoured
them
with
a
visit
there
for
looting
purposes
just
before
he
was
caught
at
hymen
house
about
we
were
met
by
a
captain
and
men
from
oudtshoorn
and
the
george
men
went
back
we
got
safely
into
oudtshoorn
about
and
expected
to
be
there
about
three
or
four
days
but
the
work
was
heavier
than
had
been
expected
and
we
were
there
a
whole
fortnight
this
was
rather
fortunate
for
me
as
i
knocked
up
with
a
very
sharp
touch
of
dysentery
again
and
should
not
have
been
fit
to
travel
much
sooner
the
oudtshoorn
people
were
extremely
kind
and
when
i
got
better
i
had
some
charming
drives
to
visit
farms
and
other
places
of
interest
it
is
a
rich
farming
district
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
anything
of
ostrich
farming
and
tobacco
growing
so
i
found
a
great
deal
to
interest
me
they
also
grow
grapes
and
other
fruits
and
it
is
a
good
country
the
ostriches
do
especially
well
all
along
the
course
of
the
river
i
got
some
good
photos
of
the
ungainly
creatures
martial
law
was
very
strict
and
besides
the
same
rules
as
those
which
i
told
you
were
in
force
at
george
the
farmers
were
not
allowed
to
keep
any
horses
or
food
supplies
on
their
farms
in
case
the
boers
should
take
a
fancy
to
them
all
horses
had
to
be
sold
to
the
remount
department
at
a
fixed
price
and
farmers
and
other
residents
in
the
district
who
were
accustomed
to
keeping
plenty
of
good
horses
might
be
seen
coming
into
town
with
oxen
in
their
traps
and
as
they
were
not
allowed
to
keep
more
than
a
week
supply
of
food
or
forage
on
their
farms
and
as
some
lived
many
miles
away
they
had
to
spend
a
good
part
of
their
time
on
the
road
in
drawing
their
rations
as
of
course
the
oxen
are
very
slow
travellers
they
were
reaping
the
corn
when
we
were
there
and
it
all
had
to
be
carted
into
town
and
sold
to
the
military
people
as
they
cut
it
oudtshoorn
being
far
from
the
railway
had
been
very
short
of
provisions
groceries
for
some
time
past
and
the
military
authorities
would
not
allow
any
waggons
to
go
up
from
the
coast
without
a
strong
escort
which
could
not
often
be
spared
but
a
convoy
had
been
sent
through
before
we
got
there
so
there
was
plenty
of
food
and
our
provision
cart
had
a
few
luxuries
which
seemed
to
be
appreciated
at
the
two
dinner
parties
we
gave
from
oudtshoorn
we
still
had
more
than
a
day
journey
to
join
the
railway
at
prince
albert
road
and
horses
were
so
scarce
that
it
was
not
easy
to
get
decent
animals
we
sent
the
baggage
cart
with
mules
on
ahead
and
eventually
my
brother
and
i
and
our
man
got
away
in
a
light
cape
cart
with
two
fairly
good
horses
and
the
other
men
had
four
screws
in
a
bigger
cart
the
scenery
as
we
crossed
the
zwartberg
was
very
but
not
quite
so
as
the
montague
pass
it
was
very
stiff
work
for
the
horses
and
we
walked
a
good
deal
our
first
outspan
was
near
the
cango
caves
where
they
had
recently
had
a
visit
from
a
boer
commando
and
then
we
had
to
give
the
horses
a
good
rest
at
the
victoria
hotel
high
up
on
the
zwartberg
we
were
rather
disturbed
to
find
when
we
caught
up
our
baggage
cart
that
it
had
no
brake
on
it
the
road
is
tremendously
steep
as
it
zigzags
down
the
mountain
so
the
sergeant
in
charge
of
our
escort
left
a
trooper
to
help
the
boy
bring
the
mules
down
we
got
in
about
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
baggage
cart
that
night
and
the
commandant
who
had
ridden
out
to
meet
us
and
then
dined
with
us
was
anxious
because
only
one
trooper
had
been
left
with
it
so
he
sent
some
more
men
out
to
meet
them
we
had
to
go
to
bed
without
our
baggage
feeling
very
anxious
as
every
one
seemed
to
think
the
boers
would
much
like
to
get
hold
of
it
and
also
of
the
mules
i
have
seen
plenty
of
barbed
wire
in
south
africa
but
have
never
seen
so
much
as
at
prince
albert
they
stretch
it
even
across
the
village
street
at
night
and
you
ca
go
many
yards
without
getting
tied
up
in
it
the
next
morning
if
we
were
to
catch
our
train
and
there
was
only
the
one
train
a
day
we
knew
we
must
be
away
by
but
still
no
sign
of
our
baggage
and
then
at
last
we
heard
that
it
was
safe
but
the
crossbar
of
the
harness
had
broken
and
they
had
had
to
spend
the
night
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
a
trooper
had
ridden
in
and
gone
back
with
new
harness
so
after
sitting
at
our
gate
with
the
commandant
with
a
fresh
supply
of
carts
and
a
fresh
escort
until
it
was
too
late
for
it
to
be
for
us
to
catch
our
train
we
had
to
decide
to
wait
till
the
next
day
and
various
wires
had
to
be
despatched
about
the
railway
carriage
about
two
hours
later
the
missing
arrived
all
well
with
a
very
weary
driver
and
troopers
in
attendance
we
had
a
pleasant
day
at
prince
albert
and
the
next
day
having
sent
the
baggage
on
at
an
early
hour
we
had
an
easy
drive
of
miles
with
some
excellent
horses
most
kindly
lent
to
us
by
the
commandant
to
the
rail
at
prince
albert
road
we
outspanned
only
once
at
boter
kraal
where
the
final
escort
met
us
the
sergeant
coming
up
to
salute
and
to
tell
us
that
he
and
his
men
had
searched
the
kopjes
thoroughly
since
and
had
seen
no
boers
but
at
kraal
they
told
us
of
a
recent
visit
from
pyper
commando
thus
ended
our
odd
miles
of
driving
across
the
colony
in
this
sort
of
a
war
without
once
having
had
the
excitement
of
seeing
any
armed
or
hostile
boers
about
thirty
hours
in
a
hot
and
dusty
train
brought
us
into
kimberley
the
dull
old
karroo
country
looked
much
the
same
as
when
i
saw
it
ten
years
ago
except
that
every
few
hundred
yards
on
the
line
a
blockhouse
is
standing
and
a
sentry
in
his
shirtsleeves
marches
up
and
down
with
his
rifle
while
the
rest
of
the
garrison
some
men
come
to
look
at
the
train
and
to
sing
out
papers
they
have
a
terribly
monotonous
life
and
one
throws
them
every
scrap
of
literature
one
possesses
xlix
kimberley
south
africa
i
think
it
is
just
about
ten
years
since
i
was
here
last
and
the
place
has
changed
many
of
my
old
friends
have
left
and
so
many
have
died
that
i
am
beginning
to
be
almost
afraid
to
ask
after
any
one
in
case
i
should
hear
of
his
death
of
course
they
have
been
through
all
the
horrors
of
a
four
siege
and
there
are
still
many
marks
of
the
boer
shells
to
be
seen
one
of
them
had
made
a
hole
through
our
backyard
wall
and
buried
itself
in
the
kitchen
wall
peter
the
cat
found
this
hole
very
convenient
when
going
out
to
visit
his
friends
many
people
still
preserved
the
bombproof
shelters
or
in
their
gardens
where
they
used
to
take
refuge
when
the
shelling
was
going
on
and
then
go
back
into
their
houses
at
night
to
cook
the
food
there
is
a
big
steam
hooter
at
de
beers
mine
and
during
the
siege
whenever
the
lookout
men
saw
the
boers
preparing
to
shell
the
town
the
hooter
was
sounded
and
every
one
scuttled
into
shelter
and
even
now
whenever
the
hooter
sounds
people
start
up
and
look
inclined
to
run
the
civilians
here
can
not
say
enough
for
the
way
cecil
rhodes
worked
during
the
siege
and
his
thoughtfulness
and
consideration
for
the
women
and
children
were
beyond
all
praise
at
one
time
he
had
many
hundreds
of
them
in
safety
down
one
of
the
mines
feet
below
the
surface
and
he
took
infinite
pains
to
send
them
down
suitable
supplies
they
were
in
fairly
airy
chambers
and
had
a
good
supply
of
electric
light
of
course
the
military
people
are
not
so
enthusiastic
about
his
assistance
but
naturally
they
would
not
appreciate
a
man
who
always
liked
to
have
his
own
way
and
do
what
he
thought
best
and
who
did
it
too
the
first
thing
the
boers
did
was
to
seize
the
waterworks
some
miles
from
the
town
and
cut
off
the
water
supply
but
the
came
to
the
rescue
by
pumping
water
from
a
good
spring
in
one
of
their
mines
that
had
caused
them
years
of
annoyance
by
rising
and
making
the
working
of
that
mine
a
great
difficulty
so
the
water
question
never
caused
them
much
trouble
though
the
boers
were
constantly
trying
to
damage
the
pumping
machinery
though
the
water
supply
was
fair
the
food
supplies
were
very
low
and
a
rich
family
whom
i
know
told
me
they
were
intensely
grateful
to
a
neighbour
who
sent
them
a
quarter
of
a
bottle
of
port
wine
and
half
a
packet
of
cornflour
as
a
christmas
present
they
were
at
that
time
drawing
half
their
ration
of
meat
in
horseflesh
and
though
some
people
say
they
could
never
touch
it
i
believe
it
was
not
at
all
bad
and
one
girl
told
me
that
a
little
donkey
was
quite
nice
a
good
story
is
told
of
a
colonel
who
was
then
up
here
one
night
at
mess
he
said
gentlemen
i
am
sorry
to
say
we
were
only
able
to
draw
half
our
ration
in
beef
this
joint
i
am
carving
is
beef
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
the
joint
is
horse
if
any
one
would
prefer
to
try
it
perhaps
he
will
carve
for
himself
no
one
got
up
so
the
colonel
had
to
carve
small
helpings
for
all
the
mess
after
they
had
finished
an
orderly
came
and
whispered
to
him
and
he
said
oh
gentlemen
i
am
sorry
to
find
i
have
made
a
mistake
i
find
this
was
the
horse
and
the
cow
is
still
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
there
was
so
much
sickness
in
the
town
that
the
doctors
had
a
terrible
time
in
most
cases
it
was
suitable
food
rather
than
medicine
that
was
needed
especially
amongst
the
little
children
and
besides
the
sickness
there
were
a
great
many
wounded
constantly
being
brought
in
from
the
trenches
or
from
skirmishes
and
every
available
building
was
turned
into
a
hospital
i
have
just
been
reading
ashe
book
by
the
and
it
gives
a
good
idea
of
the
daily
life
up
here
showing
how
men
tried
to
go
on
and
do
their
daily
round
of
work
in
spite
of
the
shells
that
were
falling
and
killing
not
only
men
but
women
and
children
around
them
the
thing
that
kimberley
people
are
most
proud
of
is
the
big
gun
long
cecil
which
was
most
cleverly
designed
and
made
in
the
de
beers
workshops
during
the
siege
the
shells
for
it
also
being
cast
there
until
that
was
built
they
had
guns
of
sufficient
size
to
reply
to
the
that
the
boers
were
using
with
so
much
effect
upon
the
town
it
must
have
been
a
huge
surprise
to
them
when
long
cecil
began
to
scatter
shells
amongst
them
each
one
inscribed
with
compliments
the
cemetery
is
sadly
full
of
siege
graves
and
so
many
little
children
graves
amongst
them
strangely
enough
one
of
the
de
beers
engineers
an
american
who
was
chiefly
responsible
for
the
building
of
long
cecil
was
killed
by
a
boer
shell
only
a
few
days
after
the
gun
was
completed
and
just
as
an
example
of
how
we
were
surrounded
by
enemies
even
inside
the
town
i
will
tell
you
about
his
funeral
in
such
a
hot
climate
as
south
africa
it
is
always
necessary
that
the
funeral
should
take
place
within
about
hours
of
the
death
so
that
it
is
quite
possible
to
be
talking
to
a
man
in
his
shop
or
at
his
business
in
the
morning
for
him
to
be
taken
suddenly
ill
and
die
that
evening
and
the
next
day
before
you
have
heard
of
his
illness
for
you
to
meet
his
coffin
on
the
way
to
the
cemetery
well
this
poor
engineer
was
a
very
popular
man
and
the
commandant
thought
that
many
people
would
wish
to
attend
his
funeral
so
he
gave
directions
that
it
should
be
at
night
for
safety
from
the
boer
shells
late
in
the
evening
when
it
was
quite
dark
the
funeral
left
the
hospital
but
it
had
no
sooner
started
than
a
rocket
was
seen
to
go
up
the
town
evidently
a
signal
for
almost
at
once
the
boers
began
to
drop
shells
around
the
cemetery
but
fortunately
no
one
was
killed
perhaps
you
have
heard
in
england
of
the
little
girl
who
knew
so
much
about
martial
law
that
she
strayed
into
the
provost
office
one
day
in
december
and
said
please
sir
may
i
have
a
permit
for
santa
claus
to
come
to
our
house
all
food
seems
to
be
frightfully
expensive
still
we
have
to
pay
about
for
a
single
fowl
or
duck
a
dozen
for
eggs
and
a
pound
for
butter
we
have
a
white
woman
as
cook
and
our
black
boy
rejoices
in
the
name
of
moses
i
had
not
been
here
many
days
before
george
came
to
see
me
the
boy
i
used
to
have
ten
years
ago
it
is
extraordinary
how
these
natives
know
when
one
returns
even
years
afterwards
of
course
george
wanted
to
come
back
but
i
found
he
was
in
a
good
place
so
i
told
him
i
was
soon
going
back
to
england
and
i
did
not
take
him
on
i
have
had
two
offers
of
rather
good
posts
out
here
but
i
think
i
must
go
home
for
a
time
at
there
is
a
huge
refugee
camp
just
outside
kimberley
i
am
afraid
they
have
had
an
awful
lot
of
measles
in
these
camps
and
there
have
been
many
deaths
from
it
measles
were
almost
unknown
on
the
scattered
boer
farms
and
now
that
these
people
are
crowded
together
in
close
quarters
with
their
traditional
objection
to
fresh
air
or
cleanliness
it
seems
impossible
to
make
them
take
precautions
against
infection
as
a
rule
the
people
in
the
refugee
camps
have
rations
quite
as
good
and
often
much
better
than
the
troops
but
they
do
not
thrive
on
them
still
it
was
impossible
to
leave
them
on
the
farms
for
the
only
way
to
prevent
the
boers
from
keeping
up
their
supplies
was
to
take
or
destroy
the
crops
and
after
that
was
done
it
was
impossible
to
leave
the
women
and
children
on
the
farms
to
starve
now
they
are
sending
sisters
to
work
in
these
camps
and
they
are
doing
all
they
can
to
help
the
people
but
i
fancy
it
must
be
rather
uphill
work
as
many
of
the
boer
women
are
so
very
suspicious
and
bitter
i
daresay
you
have
heard
of
the
woman
who
urged
her
husband
to
go
and
fight
saying
i
can
get
another
husband
but
i
ca
get
another
free
state
i
have
had
some
interesting
drives
round
the
country
with
a
lady
who
was
here
all
through
the
siege
and
could
show
me
where
the
fighting
had
taken
place
and
one
day
some
officers
gave
a
very
jolly
picnic
at
a
place
called
the
bend
about
seventeen
miles
from
here
on
the
vaal
river
it
was
very
hot
weather
just
then
to
in
the
shade
so
we
started
at
and
had
breakfast
and
lunch
out
there
a
mulecart
loaded
with
provisions
delicious
peaches
and
other
fruits
which
had
been
sent
up
from
cape
town
had
been
despatched
in
charge
of
four
orderlies
all
armed
we
rowed
on
the
river
and
prowled
about
under
the
trees
and
altogether
it
was
quite
the
nicest
picnic
i
have
ever
enjoyed
one
of
the
officers
of
our
party
had
the
honour
of
being
the
youngest
colonel
in
the
british
army
he
has
been
promoted
so
rapidly
during
the
war
they
had
all
had
a
rough
time
of
hardship
but
they
meant
to
enjoy
themselves
that
day
and
i
think
they
did
but
they
kept
their
revolvers
handy
even
when
rowing
up
the
river
i
had
been
told
that
i
was
entitled
to
an
indulgence
passage
home
as
i
have
served
during
the
war
and
that
would
mean
that
i
should
have
to
pay
only
about
for
my
mess
on
a
trooper
instead
of
paying
about
for
a
passage
on
an
ordinary
so
i
went
to
the
railway
staff
officer
and
he
was
most
kind
in
arranging
about
it
for
me
and
after
communicating
with
cape
town
he
told
me
that
if
i
would
see
the
when
i
arrived
down
there
he
would
probably
be
glad
if
i
would
do
duty
for
the
voyage
and
then
i
could
travel
quite
free
and
receive
pay
instead
of
having
to
pay
my
mess
bill
he
also
gave
me
a
free
railway
pass
down
to
the
cape
which
i
had
not
at
all
expected
now
i
must
pay
some
farewell
calls
and
then
once
more
i
shall
soon
be
on
the
move
again
it
really
does
seem
as
though
the
war
will
soon
be
over
now
we
hear
that
some
troops
are
still
coming
out
but
there
appear
to
be
more
than
enough
sisters
for
the
work
that
has
to
be
done
l
orient
for
home
i
was
very
sorry
to
say
to
kimberley
but
i
was
also
getting
very
so
early
one
morning
i
once
more
joined
the
train
to
stroll
across
the
karroo
and
down
to
cape
town
i
had
armed
myself
with
a
large
stock
of
literature
kindly
given
to
me
by
friends
and
also
by
the
librarian
of
the
kimberley
public
library
who
gave
me
a
noble
stock
of
back
numbers
and
this
i
distributed
to
the
men
at
the
blockhouses
on
the
way
poor
fellows
they
have
a
trying
time
of
it
they
must
be
very
wide
awake
and
alert
or
any
night
the
boers
may
cross
the
section
of
line
for
which
they
are
responsible
very
likely
leaving
a
little
dynamite
to
wreck
the
next
train
and
yet
for
weeks
and
perhaps
months
never
a
boer
may
come
near
their
particular
section
the
trains
were
still
not
supposed
to
travel
at
night
so
we
tied
up
about
on
the
first
day
at
de
aar
after
dinner
i
was
just
thinking
it
was
very
slow
not
knowing
any
one
in
the
place
and
i
thought
i
would
go
to
bed
when
i
saw
a
general
strolling
along
the
platform
and
with
him
a
young
officer
whom
i
soon
recognised
as
an
old
pinetown
patient
and
whom
i
was
very
glad
to
meet
again
the
general
soon
departed
and
then
captain
took
me
for
a
jolly
moonlight
walk
round
de
aar
he
was
still
a
little
lame
from
his
wound
so
was
acting
as
adjutant
for
some
yeomanry
there
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
about
many
other
old
friends
and
also
a
little
about
the
course
of
the
war
in
that
part
of
the
country
the
next
day
as
we
proceeded
down
the
line
we
passed
some
troop
trains
going
up
with
men
who
had
just
arrived
fresh
from
england
i
think
some
of
the
scots
guards
the
manchesters
and
the
lancashire
fusiliers
some
of
them
were
tightly
packed
in
open
waggons
and
appeared
to
think
they
were
having
a
rough
time
already
but
as
the
weather
was
warm
and
dry
they
were
not
so
badly
off
they
seemed
very
glad
of
the
few
papers
which
i
could
give
them
as
they
had
seen
none
since
they
landed
their
chief
anxiety
seemed
to
be
as
to
whether
they
would
have
the
chance
of
firing
off
a
little
ammunition
before
the
war
is
over
that
night
we
tied
up
at
matjesfontein
and
i
much
regretted
i
could
not
stay
a
day
there
to
explore
the
battlefield
but
i
did
not
know
which
day
they
wanted
me
for
duty
so
i
had
to
hasten
on
the
next
morning
i
arrived
in
cape
town
and
after
a
wash
and
brush
up
i
went
to
see
the
who
was
most
kind
and
said
that
if
i
was
willing
to
do
light
duty
on
the
voyage
i
certainly
need
not
pay
for
a
passage
if
i
was
ready
he
would
like
me
to
go
on
board
the
on
the
it
was
then
the
i
had
a
few
very
pleasant
days
with
some
friends
at
rondebosch
but
i
was
unable
to
get
about
much
to
see
other
people
as
i
was
again
very
seedy
with
dysentery
and
had
to
doctor
myself
rather
severely
in
order
to
get
ready
for
duty
on
the
i
came
on
board
that
morning
at
but
there
was
such
a
gale
blowing
that
we
did
not
get
away
till
the
next
day
there
are
about
thirty
officers
and
between
and
men
on
board
almost
all
of
them
invalided
home
and
it
is
awfully
sad
to
see
so
many
wrecks
of
the
war
the
is
a
major
of
the
and
he
is
just
as
strict
with
the
orderlies
as
the
major
i
worked
with
at
pinetown
so
the
men
are
well
cared
for
and
i
am
enjoying
working
for
him
i
was
the
first
sister
to
join
the
ship
and
as
i
found
the
cabins
would
be
very
full
i
asked
if
i
might
act
as
night
sister
and
thereby
i
secured
a
cabin
to
myself
i
have
had
plenty
to
do
most
of
the
way
as
there
have
been
several
men
and
one
officer
very
ill
all
the
time
but
we
have
had
no
deaths
on
the
voyage
and
most
of
the
patients
seem
to
be
mending
now
on
my
first
night
on
duty
i
had
been
round
the
hospital
and
then
i
thought
i
would
take
a
look
at
the
convalescent
men
in
the
swinging
cots
ninety
of
them
and
i
found
there
a
poor
who
had
been
out
only
a
few
months
going
back
with
hopelessly
bad
heart
disease
from
overstrain
he
was
unable
to
lie
down
and
so
breathless
and
blue
i
got
him
transferred
to
the
hospital
and
was
able
to
make
him
comfortable
with
pillows
he
has
been
such
a
good
patient
and
has
improved
a
little
but
i
fear
he
can
never
work
again
and
he
is
a
married
man
there
are
two
quite
young
lads
who
have
been
having
epileptic
fits
frequently
on
the
voyage
i
suppose
brought
on
by
exposure
to
the
south
african
sun
a
young
yorkshire
farmer
of
the
yeomanry
was
invalided
home
as
a
phthisis
case
but
he
came
into
hospital
the
day
after
we
sailed
with
a
temperature
of
and
he
has
been
desperately
ill
with
enteric
all
the
way
severe
h√¶morrhage
he
must
have
had
fever
for
some
time
before
it
was
diagnosed
the
temperature
being
attributed
to
his
chest
condition
he
is
still
very
weak
but
i
think
he
will
pull
through
one
night
i
was
told
that
a
man
in
the
swinging
cots
was
rather
peculiar
so
i
went
down
to
see
him
first
thing
and
found
his
cot
empty
i
flew
up
on
deck
and
met
some
stewards
who
had
collared
him
on
the
upper
deck
we
made
him
snug
in
a
safe
corner
of
the
hospital
with
a
special
for
that
night
then
there
was
one
poor
fellow
who
had
lost
an
arm
and
two
who
had
each
lost
a
leg
one
of
the
latter
a
who
was
wounded
at
the
same
time
that
colonel
benson
was
killed
at
vlakfontein
he
was
a
kimberley
man
and
the
poor
man
wife
and
two
little
children
were
all
killed
by
one
boer
shell
during
the
siege
of
kimberley
he
is
going
home
to
get
fitted
up
with
a
cork
leg
and
will
then
return
to
south
africa
perhaps
the
saddest
cases
of
all
were
the
eleven
lunatics
we
had
on
board
they
had
to
be
very
safely
kept
with
special
guards
and
other
precautions
and
in
case
they
should
try
to
go
overboard
they
had
a
enclosure
on
deck
as
an
airing
ground
some
of
them
are
very
mad
and
violent
but
some
seemed
so
nearly
sane
that
it
was
a
question
whether
they
had
not
pretended
to
be
mad
in
order
to
be
sent
home
i
was
not
supposed
to
visit
these
men
in
the
night
because
to
get
to
them
i
should
have
had
to
go
a
long
way
through
the
troops
sleeping
quarters
but
the
medical
officer
went
to
see
them
on
his
last
round
and
every
two
or
three
hours
i
used
to
stay
in
the
hospital
while
the
wardmaster
went
along
and
brought
word
how
they
were
one
night
the
medical
officer
went
along
and
when
he
returned
he
told
me
he
had
found
their
door
unlocked
and
no
guard
on
duty
fortunately
they
were
all
asleep
the
next
day
this
tale
was
about
the
ship
and
very
soon
it
was
altered
to
the
following
version
last
night
had
found
that
all
the
lunatics
had
escaped
he
and
sister
thought
it
better
not
to
make
a
fuss
instead
they
caught
the
first
eleven
men
whom
they
met
and
locked
them
up
they
were
not
the
lunatics
but
they
had
been
bribed
with
extra
to
play
the
game
and
say
nothing
about
it
but
the
real
lunatics
were
still
at
large
after
that
if
any
one
came
up
to
a
man
rather
quietly
there
was
a
big
jump
and
hullo
are
you
one
of
them
and
then
a
great
chase
round
the
deck
there
were
some
hard
cases
too
amongst
the
officers
two
of
them
who
had
thighs
broken
by
boer
shells
but
were
just
beginning
to
walk
again
one
however
with
a
short
leg
and
the
other
with
a
stiff
knee
a
yeomanry
officer
badly
shot
in
both
arms
had
one
hand
still
quite
useless
but
i
hope
an
operation
may
improve
matters
he
had
had
a
dreadful
time
in
the
jolting
ambulance
waggons
unable
to
hold
on
or
to
save
himself
with
either
hand
then
there
was
a
young
doctor
who
once
when
our
men
were
surprised
and
many
of
them
taken
was
going
round
dressing
the
wounded
when
some
boers
came
up
and
shot
the
wounded
as
he
was
dressing
them
and
afterwards
led
him
out
several
times
saying
they
were
going
to
shoot
him
but
eventually
he
got
safely
away
there
were
two
officers
shot
through
the
lungs
but
i
think
they
will
recover
in
time
and
there
was
another
young
fellow
shot
in
the
region
of
the
spine
and
paralysed
all
down
one
side
and
leg
and
yet
another
quite
a
boy
shot
in
the
thigh
and
paralysed
on
that
side
neither
of
these
two
could
move
without
assistance
and
though
they
were
all
wonderfully
bright
and
cheerful
i
know
i
often
found
them
lying
awake
for
hours
together
and
it
is
hard
for
a
young
englishman
to
face
the
thought
that
he
may
never
be
able
to
walk
or
ride
again
even
when
he
received
his
wound
in
defence
of
his
country
as
i
finish
this
letter
we
are
just
anchoring
for
the
night
in
southampton
water
off
netley
hospital
and
curiously
enough
it
is
march
the
very
day
i
sailed
for
south
africa
two
years
ago
we
hope
to
land
at
southampton
after
a
little
time
at
home
i
hope
to
persuade
a
sister
of
mine
to
pay
a
visit
with
me
to
another
brother
in
the
united
states
and
to
some
relations
in
canada
and
nova
scotia
then
i
must
settle
down
to
some
steady
work
in
england
i
would
not
have
missed
nursing
through
this
war
for
a
great
deal
we
have
often
had
rough
times
and
anxious
times
and
of
course
i
have
not
been
able
to
do
much
but
i
have
been
able
to
help
a
few
men
to
recover
their
health
and
strength
and
perhaps
also
to
help
a
few
in
their
last
hours
men
whose
own
relations
would
have
given
much
to
have
been
in
my
place
where
it
was
not
possible
for
them
to
be
and
however
busy
i
was
i
could
at
least
find
time
to
remind
them
that
god
shall
wipe
away
all
tears
from
their
eyes
and
there
shall
be
no
more
death
neither
sorrow
nor
crying
neither
shall
there
be
any
more
still
no
one
who
has
not
seen
it
can
realise
the
sorrow
and
the
suffering
that
war
entails
and
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
a
man
who
was
in
kimberley
during
the
siege
who
helped
cecil
rhodes
in
his
work
there
and
who
afterwards
when
asked
if
he
was
not
glad
that
he
had
had
the
chance
of
assisting
rhodes
in
his
great
work
said
yes
but
when
i
think
of
all
the
suffering
those
unfortunate
women
and
children
had
to
endure
i
think
if
i
was
ever
again
in
a
country
where
war
was
imminent
i
should
take
a
ship
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
stop
there
till
it
was
over
i
fear
that
we
are
not
likely
all
to
be
able
to
do
that
but
i
trust
this
war
will
have
had
the
effect
of
making
people
think
and
that
should
there
ever
be
another
war
in
our
time
we
may
be
better
prepared
for
it
war
must
always
mean
suffering
but
the
suffering
might
be
enormously
lessened
if
we
were
