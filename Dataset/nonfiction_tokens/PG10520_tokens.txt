some

a

particular
care
must
be
had
that
the
pot
wherein
the

is
made
be
very
sweet
earthen
i
thinke
is
the
best
and
judgement
is
to
be
had
carefully
both
in
the
size
of
the
pot
and
in
the
quantity
of
the
water
at
the
first
that
so
the
broth
may
grow
afterwards
to
be
neither
too
much
nor
too
little
nor
too
grosse
nor
too
thin
thy
meat
must
be
long
in
boyling
but
the
fire
not
too
fierce
the
bacon
the
beef
the
pease
the
chesnuts
the
hogs
eares
may
be
put
in
at
the
first
i
am
utterly
against
those
confused
olios
into
which
men
put
almost
all
kinds
of
meats
and
roots
and
especially
against
putting
of
oyle
for
it
corrupts
the
broath
instead
of
adding
goodnesse
to
it
to
do
well
the
broth
is
rather
to
be
drunk
out
of
a
porringer
then
to
be
eaten
with
a
spoon
though
you
add
some
smal
slices
of
bread
to
it
you
wil
like
it
the
worse
the
sauce
for
thy
meat
must
be
as
much
fine
sugar
beaten
smal
to
powder
with
a
little
mustard
as
can
be
made
to
drink
the
sugar
up
and
you
wil
find
it
to
be
excellent
but
if
you
make
it
not
faithfully
and
justly
according
to
this
prescript
but
shall
neither
put
mace
or
rosemary
or
tyme
to
the
herbs
as
the
manner
is
of
some
it
will
prove
very
much
the
worse
make
take
all
sorts
of
herbs
that
are
good
and
wholesome
as
balme
mint
fennell
rosemary
angelica
wilde
tyme
isop
burnet
egrimony
and
such
other
as
you
think
fit
some
field
herbs
but
you
must
not
put
in
too
many
but
especially
rosemary
or
any
strong
hearb
lesse
then
halfe
a
handfull
will
serve
of
every
sort
you
must
boyle
your

and
straine

but
let

have
all
the

have
a
peg
in
the
top
to
give
it
vent
when
you
heare
it
make
