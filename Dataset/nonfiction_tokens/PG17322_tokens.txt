the
chapel
is
usually
small
and
is
almost
lost
in
the
great
extent
of
the
building
it
generally
consists
merely
of
an
oblong
chamber
approached
by
a
rather
short
passage

the

of
the

chambers
as

also

these
are
exceptions
as
may
be
ascertained
by
consulting
the
work
of
mariette
most
of
those
which
contain
several
rooms
are
ancient
mastabas
which
have
been
subsequently
altered
or
enlarged

is
the
case
with
the
mastabas

hollowed
at

the
general
appearance

that
of

low
narrow
doorway
too
small
to
be
a
practicable
entrance
the
recess
thus
formed

almost
always
left
empty

however
the
piety
of
relatives
placed
within
it
a
statue
of
the
deceased
standing
there
with

thrown

from

dark
lodging
where
it
lies
embalmed
to
those
glowing
plains
where
he
dwelt
in
freedom
during
his
earthly
life
another
moment
crossing
the
threshold
he
must
descend
the
few
steps
leading
into
the
public
hall
on
festivals
and
days
of
offering
when
the
priest
and
family
presented

customary
rites
this
great
painted
figure
in
the
act
of
advancing
and
seen
by
the
light
of
flickering
torches
or
smoking
lamps
might
well
appear
endued
with
life
it
was
as
if
the
dead
ancestor
himself
stepped
out
of
the
wall
and
mysteriously
stood
before
his
descendants
to
claim
their
homage

he
has

satisfaction
the

represented
to
the
visitor
the
door
leading
to
the
private
apartments
of
the
deceased
the
fact
of
its
being
walled
up
for
ever
showing
that
no
living
mortal
might
cross
its

the
inscription
which
covered
its
surface
was
not
a
mere
epitaph
informing
future
generations
who
it
was
that
reposed
beneath
it
perpetuated
the
name
and
genealogy
of
the
deceased
and
gave
him
a
civil
status
without

was
reckoned
as
nor
was
this
the
only
use
of
the
stele
the
pictures
and
prayers
inscribed
upon
it
acted
as
so
many
talismans
for
ensuring
the
continuous
existence
of
the
ancestor
whose
memory
they
recalled

compelled

god
therein

osiris

the
jackal

the

those
good
things
abundantly
offered
to
the
deities

by
which
they
live
on
condition
that
a
share
of
them
might
first
be
set
aside
for
the

by
the
divine
favour

rather

he
might

from

the

that
pleased
him
best
whether

he
might
follow
the

its
life
from
its
birth
in
the
meadows
to
the
and
the

and
might
satisfy
his
hunger
with
its

the
double
saw
himself
represented
in
the
paintings
as
hunting
and
to
the
hunt
he
went
he
was
painted
eating
and
drinking
with
his

and
he
ate
and
drank
with
her
the
pictured
ploughing

became

him
actual
realities

fine
this

and
things
represented
upon
the

was
quickened
by
the
same
life
which
animated
the
double
upon
whom
it
all
depended
the
of
a
meal
or
of
a
slave
was
perhaps
that
which
best
suited
the
of
guest
or
of
master
even
when
we
enter
one
of
these
decorated
chapels
the
idea
of
death
scarcely
presents
itself
we
have
rather
the
impression
of
being
in
some
house
to
which
the
master
may
at
any
moment
return
we
see
him
portrayed
everywhere
upon
the
walls
followed
by
his
servants
and
surrounded
by
everything
which
made
his
earthly
life
enjoyable
one
or
two
statues
of
him
stand
at
the
end
of
the
room
in
constant
readiness
to
undergo
the
of
the
and
to
receive
offerings
should
these
be
accidentally
removed
others
secreted
in
a
little
chamber
hidden
in
the
thickness
of
the
masonry
are
there
to
replace
them
these
inner
chambers
have
rarely
any
external
outlet
though
occasionally
they
are
connected
with
the
chapel
by
a
small
opening
so
narrow
that
it
will
hardly
admit
of
a
hand
being
passed
through
it
those
who
came
to
repeat
prayers
and
burn
incense
at
this
aperture
were
received
by
the
dead
in
person
the
statues
were
not
mere
images
devoid
of
consciousness
just
as
the
double
of
a
god
could
be
linked
to
an
idol
in
the
temple
sanctuary
in
order
to
transform
it
into
a
prophetic
being
capable
of
speech
and
movement
so
when
the
double
of
a
man
was
attached
to
the
effigy
of
his
earthly
body
whether
in
stone
metal
or
wood
a
real
living
person
was
created
and
was
introduced
into
the
tomb
so
strong
was
this
conviction
that
the
belief
has
lived
on
through
two
changes
of
religion
until
the
present
day
the
double
still
haunts
the
statues
with
which
he
was
associated
in
the
past
as
in
former
times
he
yet
strikes
with
madness
or
death
any
who
dare
to
disturb
is
repose
and
one
can
only
be
protected
from
him
by
breaking
at
the
moment
of
discovery
the
perfect
statues
which
the
vault
contains
the
double
is
weakened
or
killed
by
the
mutilation
of
these
his
sustainers
the
legends
still
current
about
the
pyramids
of
gîzeh
furnish
some
good
examples
of
this
kind
of
superstition
guardian
of
the
eastern
pyramid
was
an
idol
who
had
both
eyes
open
and
was
seated
on
a
throne
having
a
sort
of
halberd
near
it
on
which
if
any
one
fixed
his
eye
he
heard
a
fearful
noise
which
struck
terror
to
his
heart
and
caused
the
death
of
the
hearer
there
was
a
spirit
appointed
to
wait
on
each
guardian
who
departed
not
from
before
the
keeping
of
the
other
two
pyramids
was
in
like
manner
entrusted
to
a
statue

the
statues
furnish
in
their
modelling
a
more
correct
idea
of
the
deceased
than
his
mummy
disfigured

it
was
by
the
work
of
the
embalmers
they
were
also

hence
arose
the

incredible

these

on
closer
examination
we
always
find
that
either
the
intruder
is
connected
with
the
god
by
a
genealogy
hitherto
unsuspected

that
he
is
even
more
closely

his

when
framed
in

cartouche
and
enhanced
with
brilliant
epithets
was
no
longer
able
to
fully
represent
him
this
exaltation
of
his
person
was
therefore
marked
by
a
new
designation
as
he
was
the
living
flesh
of
the
sun
so
his
surname
always
makes
allusion
to
some
point
in
his
relations
with
his
father
and
proclaims
the
love
which
he
felt
for
the
latter

that
the

experienced
for
him
or
else
it

the
stability
of
the

their
goodness
or
some
other
of
their
sovereign
virtues
several
pharaohs
of
the
ivth
dynasty
had
already
dignified
themselves
by
these
surnames
those
of
the
vith
were
the
first
to
incorporate
them
regularly
into

there
was
some
hesitation
at
first
as
to
the
position
the
surname
ought
to
occupy
and
it
was
sometimes
placed
after
the
as
in
nofirkerî
sometimes
before
it
as
in
it
was
finally
decided
to
place
it
at
the

by

in

then

of

while
still
incarnate
four
terms
seemed
thus
necessary
to
the
egyptians
in
order
to
define
accurately
the
pharaoh
both
in
time
and
in
eternity
long
centuries
were
needed
before
this
subtle
analysis
of
the
royal
person
and
the
learned
graduation
of
the
formulas
which
corresponded
to
it

transform
the

and

of

egypt
into
a
living
god
here
below
the
son
and
successor
of
the
gods
but
the
divine
concept
of
royalty
once
implanted
in
the
mind
quickly
produced
its
inevitable
consequences
from
the
moment
that
the
pharaoh
became
god
upon
earth
the
gods
of
heaven
his
fathers
or
his
brothers
and
the
goddesses
recognized
him
as
their
son

according
to
the
ceremonial
imposed
by
custom
in

consecrated

tomb
his
ancestors
the
gods
who
existed
before
him
and
who
now
reposed
impassively
within
the
depths
of
their
pyramids
this
identification
suggested
by
champollion
is
from
force
of
custom
still
adhered
to
in
nearly
all
works
on
egyptology
but
we
know
from
ancient
evidence
that
the
cucupha
was
a
bird
perhaps
a
hoopoe

of

quadruped

snout
and

retreating
ears

the

or

species
this
method
of
distinguishing
deceased
kings
is
met
with
as
far
back
as
the
of
the
harpist
which
the
egyptians
of
the
ramesside
period
attributed
to
the
founder
of
the
xith
dynasty
the
first
known
instance
of
a
temple
raised
by
an
egyptian
king
to
his
double
is
that
of
amenôthes
iii
man
as
far
as
his
body
was
concerned
and
god
in
virtue
of
his
soul
and
its
attributes
the
pharaoh
in
right
of
this
double
nature
acted
as
a
constant
mediator
between
heaven
and
earth
he
alone
was
fit
to
transmit
the
prayers
of
men
to
his
fathers
and
his
brethren
the
gods
just
as
the
head
of
a
family
was
in
his
household
the
priest
of
the
gods
of
that
family
just
as
the
chief
of
a
nome
was
in
his
nome
the
priest
in
regard
to
the
gods
of
the
nome
so
was
pharaoh
the
priest
of
the
gods
of
all
egypt
who
were
his
special
deities
he
accompanied
their
images
in
solemn
processions
he
poured
out
before
them
the
wine
and
mystic
milk
recited
the
formulas
in
their
hearing
seized
the
bull
who
was
the
victim
with
a
lasso
and
slaughtered
it
according
to
the
rite
consecrated
by
ancient
tradition
private
individuals
had
recourse
to
his
intercession
when
they
asked
some
favour
from
on
high
as
however
it
was
impossible
for
every
sacrifice
to
pass
actually
through
his
hands
the
celebrating
priest
proclaimed
at
the
beginning
of
each
ceremony
that
it
was
the
king
who
made
the
offering
di
he
and
none
other
to
osiris
phtah
and
so
that
they
might
grant
to
the
faithful
who
implored
the
object
of
their
desires
and
the
declaration
being
accepted
in
lieu
of
the
act
the
king
was
thus
regarded
as
really
officiating
on
every
occasion
for
his
subjects
do
not
agree
with
ed
meyer
or
with
erman
who
imagine
that
this
was
the
first
instance
of
the
practice
and
that
it
had
been
introduced
into
nubia
before
its
adoption
on
egyptian
soil
under
the
ancient
empire
we
meet
with
more
than
one
functionary
who
styles
himself
in
some
cases
during
his
lifetime
in
others
shortly
after
his
death
of
horus
who
lives
in
the
palace
or
of
kheops
of
sondi
of
kheops
of
mykerinos
of
usirkaf
or
other
he
thus
maintained
daily
intercourse
with
the
gods
and
they
on
their
part
did
not
neglect
any
occasion
of
communicating
with
him
they
appeared
to
him
in
dreams
to
foretell
his
future
to
command
him
to
restore
a
monument
which
was
threatened
with
ruin
to
advise
him
to
set
out
to
war
to
forbid
him
risking
his
life
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
among
other
examples
the
texts
mention
the
dream
in
which
thûtmosis
while
still
a
royal
prince
received
from
orders
to
unearth
the
great
sphinx
the
dream
in
which
phtah
forbids
minephtah
to
take

battle

the
peoples
of
the
sea

by
which
tonûatamon
king
of
napata
is
persuaded
to
undertake
the
conquest
of
egypt
herodotus
had
already
made
us
familiar
with
the
dreams
of
sabaco
and
of
the
high
priest
sethos
communication
by
prophetic
dreams
was
not
however
the
method
usually
selected
by
the
gods
they
employed
as
interpreters
of
their
wishes
the
priests
and
the
statues
in
the
temples
the
king
entered
the
chapel
where
the
statue
was
kept
and
performed
in
its
presence
the
invocatory
rites
and
questioned
it
upon
the
subject
which
occupied
his
mind
the
priest
replied
under
direct
inspiration
from
on
high
and
the
dialogue
thus
entered
upon
might
last
a
long
time
interminable
discourses
whose
records
cover
the
walls
of
the
theban
temples
inform
us
what
the
pharaoh
said
on
such
occasions
and
in
what
emphatic
tones
the
gods
replied
sometimes
the
animated
statues
raised
their
voices
in
the
darkness
of
the
sanctuary
and
themselves
announced
their
will
more
frequently
they
were
content
to
indicate
it
by
a
gesture
when
they
were
consulted
on
some
particular
subject
and
returned
no
sign
it
was
their
way
of
signifying
their
disapprobation
if
on
the
other
hand
they
significantly
bowed
their
head
once
or
twice
the
subject
was
an
acceptable
one
and
they
approved
it
no
state
affair
was
settled
without
asking
their
advice
and
without
their
giving
it
in
one
way
or
another
the
monuments
which
throw
full
light
on
the
supernatural
character
of
the
pharaohs
in
general
tell
us
but
little
of
the
individual
disposition
of
any
king
in
particular
or
of
their
everyday
life
when
by
chance
we
come
into
closer
intimacy
for
a
moment
with
the
sovereign
he
is
revealed
to
us
as
being
less
divine
and
majestic
than
we
might
have
been
led
to
believe
had
we
judged
him
only
by
his
impassive
expression
and
by
the
pomp
with
which
he
was
surrounded
in
public
not
that
he
ever
quite
laid
aside
his
grandeur
even
in
his
home
life
in
his
chamber
or
his
garden
during
those
hours
when
he
felt
himself
withdrawn
from
public
gaze
those
highest
in
rank
might
never
forget
when
they
approached
him
that
he
was
a
god
he
showed
himself
to
be
a
kind
father
a
husband
ready
to
dally
with
his
wives
and
caress
them
on
the
cheek
as
they
offered
him
a
flower
or
moved
a
piece
upon
the
as
a
literary
example
of
what
the
conduct
of
a
king
was
like
in
his
family
circle
we
may
quote
the
description
of
king
minîbphtah
in
the
story
of
the
pictures
of
the
tombs
at
show
us
the
intimate
terms
on
which
king
khuniaton
lived
with
his
wife
and
daughters
both
big
and
little
he
took
an
interest
in
those
who
waited
on
him
allowed
them
certain
breaches
of
etiquette
when
he
was
pleased
with
them
and
was
indulgent
to
their
little
failings
if
they
had
just
returned
from
foreign
lands
a
little
countrified
after
a
lengthy
exile
from
the
court
he
would
break
out
into
pleasantries
over
their
embarrassment
and
their
unfashionable
costume
kingly
pleasantries
which
excited
the
forced
mirth
of
the
bystanders
but
which
soon
fell
flat
and
had
no
meaning
for
those
outside
the
palace
the
pharaoh
was
fond
of
laughing
and
drinking
indeed
if
we
may
believe
evil
tongues
he
took
so
much
at
times
as
to
incapacitate
him
for
business
the
chase
was
not
always
a
pleasure
to
him
hunting
in
the
desert
at
least
where
the
lions
evinced
a
provoking
tendency
to
show
as
little
respect
for
the
divinity
of
the
prince
as
for
his
mortal
subjects
but
like
the
chiefs
of
old
he
felt
it
a
duty
to
his
people
to
destroy
wild
beasts
and
he
ended
by
counting
the
slain
in
hundreds
however
short
his
reign
might
be
iii
had
killed
as
many
as
a
hundred
and
two
lions
during
the
first
ten
years
of
his
reign
a
considerable
part
of
his
time
was
taken
up
in

in

against
the
libyans
in
the
regions
of
the
oasis
in

against

frequently
also
in

war
against

travelled
frequently
from

from

in

possible
place
marked
traces
of
his
visits
on

of

fresh

awaited

daily
to
all
whether
high

who
were

believed
that
they
were
wronged
by
some
official

who
came
to
appeal
to
the
justice
of
the
master
against
the
injustice
of
his
servant
if
he
quitted
the
palace
when
the
cause
had
been
heard
to
take
boat
or
to
go
to
the
temple
he
was
not
left
undisturbed
but
petitions
and
supplications
assailed
him
by
the
way
in
addition
to
this
there
were
the
daily
sacrifices
the
despatch
of
current
affairs
the
ceremonies
which
demanded
the
presence
of
the
pharaoh
and
the
reception
of
nobles

foreign
envoys
one
would
think
that
in
the
midst
of
so
many
occupations
he
would
never
feel
time
hang
heavy
on
his
hands
he
was
however
a
prey
to
that
profound
which
most
oriental
monarchs
feel
so
keenly
and
which
neither
the
cares
nor
the
pleasures
of
ordinary
life
could
dispel
like
the
sultans
of
the
nights
the
pharaohs
were
accustomed
to
have
marvellous
tales
related
to
them

they
assembled
their
councillors
to
ask
them
to
suggest
some
fresh
amusement
a
happy
thought
would
sometimes
strike
one
of
them

records
either
in

the

of
an

was
of
so
little

in

they

of

appears
to
me
to
have
been
called
during
the
ancient
empire
house
of
adoration
the
house
in
which
the
king
was
worshipped
as
in
temples
of
the
ptolemaic
epoch
was
that
in

the

the

a
quarter
to
themselves
under
the
care
of
their

they
had
their
own
houses
and
a
train
of
servants
proportionate
to
their
rank
age
and
the
fortune
of
their
family
the
nobles
who
had
appointments
at
court
and
the
royal
domestics
lived
in
the
palace
itself
but
the

of
the
different
functionaries
the

for
their

of
their

distinct
quarters
outside
the

grouped
around
narrow
courts
and
communicating
with

by

of

the
entire
building
was
constructed
of
wood
or
bricks
less
frequently
of
roughly
dressed
stone
badly
built
and
wanting
in
solidity
the
ancient
pharaohs
were
no
more
inclined
than
the
sultans
of
later
days
to
occupy
palaces
in
which
their
predecessors
had
lived
and
died
each
king
desired
to
possess
a
habitation
after
his
own
heart
one
which
would
not
be
haunted
by
the
memory
or
perchance
the
double
of
another
sovereign
these
royal
mansions
hastily
erected
hastily
filled
with
occupants
were
vacated
and
fell
into
ruin
with
no
less
rapidity
they
grew
old
with
their
master
or
even
more
rapidly
than
he
and
his
disappearance
almost
always
entailed
their
ruin
in
the
neighbourhood
of
memphis
many
of
these
palaces
might
be
seen
which
their
masters
had
built
for
eternity
an
eternity
which
did
not
last
longer
than
the
lives
of
their
builders
nothing
could
present
a
greater
variety
than
the
population
of
these
ephemeral
cities
in
the
climax
of
their
splendour
we
have
first
the
people
who
immediately
surrounded
the
pharaoh
the
retainers
of
the
palace
and
of
the
harem
whose
highly
complex
degrees
of
rank
are
revealed
to
us
on
the
monuments
his
person
was
as
it
were
minutely
subdivided
into
departments
each
requiring
its
attendants
and
their
appointed
chiefs
the
song
of
the
on
the
tomb
of
king
antûf
contains
an
allusion
to
these
ruined
palaces
gods
kings
who
were
of
yore
and
who
repose
in
their
tombs
mummies
and
manes
all
buried
alike
in
their
pyramids
when
castles
are
built
they
no
longer
have
a
place
in
them
see
thus
it
is
done
with
them
i
have
heard
the
poems
in
praise
of
imhotpû
and
of
hardidif
which
are
sung
in
the
songs
and
yet
see
where
are
their
places
their
walls
are
destroyed
their
places
no
more
as
though
they
have
never
existed
they
are
designated
by
the
general
terms
of
shonîtiû
the
of
the
circle
and
qonbîtiû
the
of
the
these
words
are
found
in
religious
inscriptions
referring
to
the

of

the
sheikhs
who
enjoyed
the
right
to

and
dispense

the
egyptian
scribes
had
endeavoured
to
draw
up
an
hierarchical
list
of
these
offices
at

we
possess
the

of
two

been
commented

by

the

which
was
an
important
one
among
a
people
devoted
to
white

in
whose
estimation
want
of
cleanliness
in

entailed
religious
impurity
like
the

they
took
their

daily

they

to

the

no

one
when

the

the

so
often
mentioned

this

is
generally
supposed

relationship

the

de

proved
long

that
this
was
not
so
and
that
functionaries
might
bear
this
title
even
though
they
were
not
blood
relations
of
the
pharaohs
it
seems
to
me
to
have
been
used
to
indicate
a
class
of
courtiers
whom
the
king
condescended
to
directly
without
the
intermediary
of
a
chamberlain
the
known
by
the
king
the
others
were
only
his
samirû
they
had
been
sought
out
to
be

companions
of
his

pastimes
while
he
was
still
living

obscure

the
of
the
children
he
had
grown
up
with
them
and
had
kept
them
about
his
person
as
his
and
counsellors
he
lavished
titles
and
offices
upon
them
by
the
dozen
according
to
the
confidence
he
felt
in
their
capacity
or
to
the
amount
of
faithfulness
with
which
he
credited
them
a
few
of
the
most
favoured
were
called
of
the

of
the

knew
all
the

recesses
of

all
the

needed
in
going
from
one
part
of
it
to
another
the
place
where
the
royal
treasures
were
kept
and
the
modes
of
access
to
it
several
of
them
were
of
the
secret
of
all
the
royal
words
and
had
authority
over
the
high
courtiers
of
the
palace
which
gave
them
the
power
of
banishing
whom
they
pleased
from
the
person
of
the
sovereign
upon
others
devolved
the
task
of
arranging
his
amusements
they
rejoiced
the
heart
of
his
majesty
by
pleasant
songs
while
the
chiefs
of
the
sailors
and
soldiers
kept
watch
over
his
safety
to
these
active
services
were
attached
honorary
privileges
which
were
highly
esteemed
such
as
the
right
to
retain
their
sandals
in
the

general
crowd
of
courtiers
could
only
enter
unshod

kissing
the
knees
and
not
the
feet
of
the
god
and
that
of
wearing
the
skin
among
those
who
enjoyed
these
distinctions
were
the
physicians
of
the
king
chaplains
and
men
of
the
roll
the
latter
did
not
confine
themselves
to
the
task
of
guiding
pharaoh
through
the
intricacies
of
ritual
nor
to
that
of
prompting
him
with
the
necessary
formulas
needed
to
make
the

taught

the

a

the

was

of
the

on

side
of
the

he
recited
what
he
recited
from
his
book
of

the
goose
began
to

forward
the
head
moved
on
to
it
and
when
both
were
united
the
goose
began
to
cackle
a
pelican
was

underwent
the

his

then
caused

to

themselves
deigned
to
become
initiated
into
the
occult
sciences
and
were
invested
with
these
formidable
powers
a
prince
who
practised
magic
would
enjoy
amongst
us
nowadays
but
small
esteem
in
egypt
sorcery
was
not
considered
incompatible
with
royalty
and
the
magicians
of
pharaoh
often
took
pharaoh
himself
as
their
pupil
such
were
the
household
the
people
about
his
person
and
those
attached
to
the
service
of
his
family
his
capital
sheltered
a
still
greater
number
of
officials
and
functionaries
who
were
charged
with
the
administration
of
his
fortune
that
is
to
say
what
he
possessed
in
egypt
in
theory
it
was
always
supposed
that
the
whole
of
the
soil
belonged
to
him
but
that
he
and
his
predecessors
had
diverted
and
parcelled
off
such
an
amount
of
it
for
the
benefit
of
their
favourites
or
for
the
hereditary
lords
that
only
half
of
the
actual
territory
remained
under
his
immediate
control
he
governed
most
of
the
nomes
of
the
delta
in
person
beyond
the
fayum
he
merely
retained
isolated
lands
enclosed
in
the
middle
of
feudal
principalities
and
often
at
considerable
distance
from
each
other
we
know
the
reputation
extending
even
to
the
classical
writers
of
antiquity
of
the
pharaohs
nechepso
and
nectanebo
for
their
skill
in
magic
arab
writers
have
moreover
collected
a
number
of
traditions
concerning
the
marvels
which
the
sorcerers
of
egypt
were
in
the
habit
of
performing
as
an
instance
i
may
quote
the
description
given
by
makrîzî
of
one
of
their
meetings
which
is
probably
taken
from
some
earlier
writer
they
were
frequently
distinguished
from
their
provincial
or
manorial
colleagues
by
the
addition
of
the
word
to
their
titles
a
term
which
indicates
in
a
general
manner
the
royal
residence
they
formed
what
we
should
nowadays
call
the
departmental
staff
of
the
public
officers
and
might
be
deputed
to
act
at
least
temporarily
in
the
provinces
or
in
the
service
of
one
of
the
feudal
princes
without
thereby
losing
their
status
as
functionaries
of
the
or
central
administration
this
seems
at
any
rate
an
obvious
inference
from
the
almost
total
absence
of
feudal
titles
on
the
most
ancient
monuments
of

it

the
extent
of
the
royal
domain
varied
with
different
dynasties
and
even
from
reign
to
reign
if
it
sometimes
decreased
owing
to
too
frequently
repeated
concessions
its
losses
were
generally
amply
compensated
by
the
confiscation
of
certain
fiefs
or
by
their
lapsing
to
the
crown
the
domain
was
always
of
sufficient
extent
to
oblige
the
pharaoh
to
confide
the
larger
portion
of
it
to
officials
of
various
kinds
and
to
farm
merely
a
small
remainder
of
the
slaves
in
the
latter

he
reserved
for
himself
all
the
profits
but
at
the
expense
of
all
the
annoyance
and
all
the

in

he
obtained
without

on

show
in
what
manner

with
what
rapidity
one
of
these
great
fiefs
was
formed
in

to
understand
the
manner
in
which
the
government
of
egypt
was
conducted
we
should
never
forget
that
the
world
was
still
ignorant
of
the
use
of
money
and
that
gold
silver
and
copper
however
abundant
we
may
suppose
them
to
have
been
were
mere
articles
of

the
most
common

egyptian
soil
pharaoh

not
then
as
the
state
is
with
us
a
treasurer
who
calculates
the
total
of
his
receipts
and
expenses
in

money
banks
his
revenue
in
specie
occupying
but
little
space
and
settles
his
accounts
from
the
same
source
his
fiscal
receipts
were
in
kind
and
it
was
in
kind
that
he
remunerated
his
servants
for
their
labour

coinage
in
which
his
subjects
paid
him
their
contributions
and
which
he
passed
on
to
his
vassals
by
way
of
salary
this
was
the
most
usual
formula
for
the
offering
on
the
funerary

and
sums
up
more
completely
than
any
other
the
nature
of
the
tax
paid
to
the
gods
by
the
living
and
consequently
the
nature
of
that
paid
to
the
king
here
as
elsewhere
the

is
modelled
on
that

the

not
always
have
sufficed
to
hold
the
mass
of
incongruous
objects
which
represented
the
returns
of
a
single
egyptian
province
as
the
products
in
which
the
tax
was
paid
took
various
forms
it
was
necessary
to
have
an
infinite
variety
of
special
agents
and
suitable
places
to

and

the
product
of
the

while
awaiting

could
only
be
kept
from
deteriorating
in
value
by
incessant
labour
in
which
a
score
of
different
classes
of
clerks
and
workmen
in
the
service
of
the
treasury
all
took
part
according
to
their
trades
if
the

ragged

was
a

just
as
much
as

the

thus
the
title
of
scribe
was
of
no
value
in
itself
and
did
not
designate
as

might
naturally
think
a

rules

was
no

the

as
soon
as
a

had
acquired
the

rudiments
of
letters
with

who
was

we
are
not
told
how
long
he
remained
in
this
occupation
we
see
merely
that
he
was
raised
successively
to
posts
of
an
analogous
kind

of
increasing
importance

amten
must
have
congratulated
himself
on
his
appointment

that
moment
his
career
became
a
great
one

advanced
quickly
up

avoided
placing

would
have
appeared

much
like

preferred
having
in

held

these
posts
successively
in
most
of
the

situated
in
the
centre

to
the
west
of

his
first
appointment
was
to
the
government
of
the
village
of
pidosû
an
unimportant
post
in
itself

one
which
entitled
him
to
a
staff

in

procured
for
him
one
of
the
greatest
indulgences
of
vanity
that
an
egyptian
could
enjoy
the

was
in
fact
a
symbol
of
command
which
only
the
nobles
and
the

associated
with

could
carry

transgressing

assumption

undertook
to
protect

the
wandering
bedouin
from

his
duties
as
chief
huntsman
had
been
the
best
preparation
he
could
have
had
for
this
arduous
task
they
had
forced
him
to
make
incessant
expeditions
among
the
mountains
to
explore
the
gorges
and
ravines
to
be
acquainted
with
the
routes
marked
out
by
wells
which
the
marauders
were
obliged
to
follow
in
their
incursions

the
pathways
and

by
which
they
could
descend
into
the
plain
of
the

running
the
game
to
earth
he
had
gained
all
the
knowledge
needful
for
repulsing
the
enemy
such
a
combination
of
capabilities
made
amten
the
most
important
noble
in
this
part
of
egypt
when
old
age
at
last
prevented
him
from
leading
an
active
life
he
accepted
by
way
of
a
pension
the
governorship
of
the
nome
of
the
haunch
with
civil
authority
military
command
local
priestly
functions
and
honorary
distinctions
he
lacked
only
one
thing
to
make
him
the
equal
of
the
nobles
of
ancient
family
and
that
was
permission
to
bequeath
without
restriction
his
towns
and
offices
to
his
children
his
private
fortune
was
not
as
great
as
we
might
be
led
to
think
he
inherited
from
his
father
only
one
estate
but
had
acquired
twelve
others
in
the
nomes
of
the
delta
whither
his
successive
appointments
had
led
him
namely
in
the
saïte
xoïte
and
letopolite
nomes
he
received
subsequently
as
a
reward
for
his
services
two
hundred

of

numerous
peasants

male
and
female
and

to
the
munificence

had
begun

holding
the

post
of

in

to
the
office
of

which
his

had
held

lived

it

exactly

his
declining
years
were
spent

the
custom
of
the
egyptians
to
construct
their
tombs
as
near
as
possible
to
the
places
where
they
resided

me
to
consider
it
as
almost
certain
that
we
ought
to
look
for
its
site
in
the
memphite
plain

the
vicinity
of
the
town

in
a
northern
direction

descendants

in

footsteps
until
the
day
came

royal
favour

an
advantageous
marriage
secured
them
the
possession
of
an
hereditary
fief
and
transformed
the
son

grandson
of
a
prosperous
scribe
into
a
feudal
lord
it
was
from
people
of
this
class

from
the

the
pharaoh

the

recruited

dynasty
et
attendance
at
court
was
not
obligatory
we
notice
however
many
nobles
about
the
person
of
pharaoh
and
there
are
numerous
examples
of
princes
with
whose
lives
we
are
familiar
filling
offices
which
appear
to
have
demanded
at
least
a
temporary
residence
in
the
palace
as
for
instance
the
charge
of
the
royal
wardrobe
when
the
king
travelled
the
great
vassals
were
compelled
to
entertain
him
and
his
suite
and
to
escort
him
to
the
frontier
of
their
domain
on
the
occasion
of
such
visits
the
king
would
often
take
away
with
him
one
of
their
sons
to
be
brought
up
with
his
own
children
an
act
which
they
on
their
part
considered
a
great
honour
while
the
king
on
his
had
a
guarantee
of
their
fidelity
in
the
person
of
these
hostages
such
of
these
young
people
as
returned
to
their
roof
when
their
education
was
finished
were
usually
most
loyal
to
the
reigning
dynasty
they
often
brought
back
with
them
some
maiden
born
in
the
purple
who
consented
to
share
their
little
provincial
sovereignty
while
in
exchange
one
or
more
of
their
sisters
entered
the
harem
of
the
pharaoh
marriages
made
and
marred
in
their
turn
the
fortunes
of
the
great
feudal
houses
whether
she
were
a
princess
or
not
each
woman
received
as
her
dowry
a
portion
of
territory
and
enlarged
by
that
amount
her
little
state
but
the
property
she
brought
might
in
a
few
years
be
taken
by
her
daughters
as
portions
and
enrich
other
houses
the
fief
seldom
could
bear
up
against
such
dismemberment
it
fell
away
piecemeal
and
by
the
third
or
fourth
generation
had
disappeared
sometimes
however
it
gained
more
than
it
lost
in
this
matrimonial
game
and
extended
its
borders
till
they
encroached
on
neighbouring
nomes
or
else
completely
absorbed
them
there
were
always
in
the
course
of
each
reign
several
great
principalities
formed
or
in
the
process
of
formation
whose
chiefs
might
be
said
to
hold
in
their
hands
the
destinies
of
the
country
pharaoh
himself
was
obliged
to
treat
them
with
deference
and
he
purchased
their
allegiance
by
renewed
and
concessions
their
ambition
was
never
satisfied
when
they
were
loaded
with
favours
and
did
not
venture
to
ask
for
more
for
themselves
they
impudently
demanded
them
for
such
of
their
children
as
they
thought
were
poorly
provided
for
their
eldest
son
not
the
high
favours
which
came
from
the
king
other
princes
were
his
privy
counsellers
his
chosen
friends
or
foremost
among
his
friends
he
had
no
share
in
all
this
pharaoh
took
good
care
not
to
reject
a
petition
presented
so
humbly
he
proceeded
to
lavish
appointments
titles
and
estates
on
the
son
in
question
if
necessity
required
it
he
would
even
seek
out
a
wife
for
him
who
might
give
him
together
with
her
hand
a
property
equal
to
that
of
his
father
the
majority
of
these
great
vassals
secretly
aspired
to
the
crown
they
frequently
had
reason
to
believe
that
they
had
some
right
to
it
either
through
their
mother
or
one
of
their
ancestors
had
they
combined
against
the
reigning
house
they
could
easily
have
gained
the
upper
hand
but
their
mutual
jealousies
prevented
this
and
the
overthrow
of
a
dynasty
to
which
they
owed
so
much
would
for
the
most
part
have
profited
them
but
little
as
soon
as
one
of
them
revolted
the
remainder
took
arms
in
defence
led
his
armies
and
fought
his
battles
if
at
times
their
ambition
and
greed
harassed
their
suzerain
at
least
their
power
was
at
his
service
and
their
allegiance
was
often
the
means
of
delaying
the
downfall
of
his
house
two
things
were
specially
needful
both
for
them
and
for
pharaoh
in
order
to
maintain
or
increase
their
authority
the
protection
of
the
gods
and
a
military
organization
which
enabled
them
to
mobilize
the
whole
of
their
forces
at
the
first
signal
the
celestial
world
was
the
faithful
image
of
our
own
it
had
its
empires
and
its
feudal
organization
the
arrangement
of
which
corresponded
to
that
of
the
terrestrial
world
the
gods
who
inhabited
it
were
dependent
upon
the
gifts
of
mortals
and
the
resources
of
each
individual
deity
and
consequently
his
power
depended
on
the
wealth
and
number
of
his
worshippers
anything
influencing
one
had
an
immediate
effect
on
the
other
the
gods
dispensed
happiness
health
and
vigour
to
those
who
made
them
large
offerings
and
instituted
pious
foundations
they
lent
their
own
weapons
and
inspired
them
with
needful
strength
to
overcome
their
enemies
they
even
came
down
to
assist
in
battle
and
every
great
encounter
of
armies
involved
an
invisible
struggle
among
the
immortals
the
gods
of
the
side
which
was
victorious
shared
with
it
in
the
triumph
and
received
a
tithe
of
the
spoil
as
the
price
of
their
help
the
gods
of
the
vanquished
were
so
much
the
poorer
their
priests
and
their
statues
were
reduced
to
slavery
and
the
destruction
of
their
people
entailed
their
own
downfall
i
may
here
remind
my
readers
of
the
numberless
and
stelae
on
which
the
king
is
represented
as
making
an
offering
to
a
god
who
replies
in
some
such
formula
as
the
following
give
thee
health
and
strength
or
give
thee
joy
and
life
for
millions
of
it
was
therefore
to
the
special
interest
of
every
one
in
egypt
from
the
pharaoh
to
the
humblest
of
his
vassals
to
maintain
the
good
will
and
power
of
the
gods
so
that
their
protection
might
be
effectively
ensured
in
the
hour
of
danger
pains
were
taken
to
embellish
their
temples
with
obelisks

altars
and
new
buildings
were
added
to
the
old
the
parts
threatened
with
ruin
were
restored

entirely
rebuilt
daily

were
brought
of
every
kind

were
sacrificed
on
the
spot
bread
flowers
fruit

as
well
as
perfumes
stuffs
vases

bricks
or
bars
of
gold
silver
which
were
all
heaped
up
in
the
treasury
within
the
recesses
of
the
crypts
if
a
dignitary
of
high
rank
wished
to
perpetuate
the
remembrance
of
his
honours
or
his
services
and
at
the
same
time
to
procure
for
his
double
the
benefit
of
endless
prayers
and
sacrifices
he
placed
special
a
statue
of
himself
on
a
votive
stele

the

of
the

for
this
purpose

then
sealed

no

from

was
required
for

of
a

in

it

in

passage
of
the
limestone
temple
built
by
the
kings
of
the
xiith

and
now
completely

that

some
of

still
rest
on
the
stone
ledge
on
which
they
were
placed
by
the
priests
of
the
god
at
the
moment
of
consecration
for
this
purpose
he
assigned
to
them
annuities

on
his
patrimonial
estates
or
in
some
cases
if
he
were
a
great

along
with
the
conditions
of

with
which
the

burdened
these
gifts
to
the
god
were
it
appears
effected
by
agreements
analogous
to
those
dealing
with
property
in
mortmain
in
modern
egypt
in
each
nome
they
constituted
in
addition
to
the
original
temporalities
of
the
temple
a
considerable
domain
constantly
enlarged
by
fresh
endowments
the
gods
had
no
daughters
for
whom
to
provide
nor
sons
among
whom
to
divide
their
inheritance
all
that
fell
to
them
remained
theirs
for
ever
and
in
the
contracts
were
inserted
imprecations
threatening
with
terrible
ills
in
this
world
and
the
next
those
who
should
abstract
the
smallest
portion
from
them
such
menaces
did
not
always
prevent
the
king
or
the
lords
from
laying
hands
on
the
temple
revenues
had
this
not
been
the
case
egypt
would
soon
have
become
a
sacerdotal
country
from
one
end
to
the
other
even
when
reduced
by
periodic
usurpations
the
domain
of
the
gods
formed
at
all
periods
about
of
the
whole
country
the
tradition
handed
down
by
diodorus
tells
us
that
the
goddess
isis
assigned
a
third
of
the
country
to
the
priests
the
whole
of
egypt
is
said
to
have
been
divided
into
three
equal
parts
the
first
of
which
belonged
to
the
priests
the
second
to
the
kings
and
the
third
to
the
warrior
class
when
we
read
in
the
great
harris
papyrus
the
list
of
the
property
possessed
by
the
temple
of
the
theban
amon
alone
all
over
egypt
under
ramses
we
can
readily
believe
that
the
tradition
of
the
greek
epoch
in
no
way
exaggerated
matters
its
administration
was
not
vested
in
a
single
body
of
priests
representing
the
whole
of
egypt
and
recruited
or
ruled
everywhere
in
the
same
fashion
there
were
as
many
bodies
of
priests
as
there
were
temples
and
every
temple
preserved
its
independent
constitution
with
which
the
clergy
of
the
neighbouring
temples
had
nothing
to
do
the
only
master
they
acknowledged
was
the
lord
of
the
territory
on
which
the
temple
was
built
either
pharaoh
or
one
of
his
nobles
the
tradition
which
made
pharaoh
the
head
of
the
different
worships
in
prevailed
everywhere
but
pharaoh
soared
too
far
above
this
world
to
confine
himself
to
the
functions
of
any
one
particular
order
of
priests
he
officiated
before
all
the
gods
without
being
specially
the
minister
of
any
and
only
exerted
his
supremacy
in
order
to
make
appointments
to
important
sacerdotal
posts
in
his
domain
the
only
exception
to
this
rule
was
in
the
case
of
the
theban
kings
of
the
xxist
dynasty
and
even
here
the
exception
is
more
apparent
than
real
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
kings
hrihor
and
pinozmû
began
by
being
high
priests
of
amon
before
ascending
the
throne
they
were
pontiffs
who
became
pharaohs
not
pharaohs
who
created
themselves
pontiffs
possibly
we
ought
to
place
smonkharî
of
the
xivth
dynasty
in
the
same
category
if
as
brugsch
assures
us
his
name
is
identical
with
the
title
of
the
high
priest
of
osiris
at
mendes
thus
proving
that
he
was
pontiff
of
osiris
in
that
town
before
he
became
king
among
other
instances
we
have
that
of
the
king
of
the
xxist
tanite
dynasty
who
appointed
mankhopirrî
high
priest
of
the
theban
amon
and
that
of
the
last
king
of
the
same
dynasty
psûsennes
il
who
conferred
the
same
office
on
prince
aûpûti
son
of
sheshonqû
the
right
of
nomination
harmonized
very
well
with
the
hereditary
transmission
of
the
priestly
office
through
members
of
the
same
family
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
show
later
on
he
reserved
the
high
priesthood
of
the
memphite
phtah
and
that
of
râ
of
heliopolis
either
for
the
princes
of
his
own
family
or
more
often
for
his
most
faithful
servants
they
were
the
docile
instruments
of
his
will
through
whom
he
exerted
the
influence
of
the
gods
and
disposed
of
their
property
without
having
the
trouble
of
administrating
it
the
feudal
lords
less
removed
from
mortal
affairs
than
the
pharaoh
did
not
disdain
to
combine
the
priesthood
of
the
temples
dependent
on
them
with
the
general
supervision
of
the
different
worships
practised
on
their
lands
the
princes
of
the
gazelle
nome
for
instance
bore
the
title
of
of
the
prophets
of
all
the
gods
but
were
correctly
speaking
prophets
of
horus
of
khnûmû
master
of
haoîrît
and
of
pakhît
mistress
of
the
the
religious
suzerainty
of
such
princes
was
the
complement
of
their
civil
and
military
power
and
their
ordinary
income
was
augmented
by
some
portion
at
least
of
the
revenues
which
the
lands
in
mortmain
furnished
annually
the
subordinate
sacerdotal
functions
were
filled
by
professional
priests
whose
status
varied
according
to
the
gods
they
served
and
the
provinces
in
which
they
were
located
although
between
the
mere
priest
and
the
chief
prophet
there
were
a
number
of
grades
to
which
the
majority
never
attained
still
the
temples
attracted
many
people
from
divers
sources
who
once
established
in
this
calling
of
life
not
only
never
left
it
but
never
rested
until
they
had
introduced
into
it
the
members
of
their
families
the
offices
they
filled
were
not
necessarily
hereditary
but
the
children
born
and
bred
in
the
shelter
of
the
sanctuary
almost
always
succeeded
to
the
positions
of
their
fathers
and
certain
families
thus
continuing
in
the
same
occupation
for
generations
at
last
came
to
be
established
as
a
sort
of
sacerdotal
nobility
we
possess
the
coffins
of
the
priests
of
the
theban
montû
for
nearly
thirty
generations
viz
from
the
xxvth
dynasty
to
the
time
of
the
ptolemies
the
inscriptions
give
us
their
genealogies
as
well
as
their
intermarriages
and
show
us
that
they
belonged
almost
exclusively
to
two
or
three
important
families
who
intermarried
with
one
another
or
took
their
wives
from
the
families
of
the
priests
of
amon
the
sacrifices
supplied
them
with
daily
meat
and
drink
the
temple
buildings
provided
them
with
their
lodging
and
its
revenues
furnished
them
with
a
salary
proportionate
to
their
position
they
were
exempted
from
the
ordinary
taxes
from
military
service
and
from
forced
labour
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
those
who
were
not
actually
members
of
the
priestly
families
strove
to
have
at
least
a
share
in
their
advantages
the
servitors
the
workmen
and
the
who
congregated
about
them
and
constituted
the
temple
corporation
the
scribes
attached
to
the
administration
of
the
domains
and
to
the
receipt
of
offerings
shared
if
not
in
the
immunity
of
the
priesthood
as
a
body
they
formed
a
separate
religious
society
side
by
side
but
distinct
from
the
civil
population
and
freed
from
most
of
the
burdens
which
weighed
so
heavily
on
the
latter
the
soldiers
were
far
from
possessing
the
wealth
and
influence
of
the
clergy
military
service
in
egypt
was
not
universally
compulsory
but
rather
the
profession
and
privilege
of
a
special
class
of
whose
origin
but
little
is
known
perhaps
originally
it
comprised
only
the
descendants
of
the
conquering
race
but
in
historic
times
it
was
not
exclusively
confined
to
the
latter
and
recruits
were
raised
everywhere
among
the
fellahs
the
bedouin
of
the
neighbourhood
the
negroes
the
nubians
and
even
from
among
the
prisoners
of
war
or
adventurers
from
beyond
the
sea
this
is
shown
alia
by
the
real
or
supposititious
letters
in
which
the
endeavours
to
deter
his
pupil
from
adopting
a
military
career
recommending
that
of
a
scribe
in
preference
uni
under
papi
recruited
his
army
from
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
whole
of
egypt
from
elephantine
to
letopolis
at
the
mouth
of
the
delta
and
as
far
as
the
mediterranean
from
among
the
bedouin
of
libya
and
of
the
isthmus
and
even
from
the
six
negro
races
of
nubia
inscription
the
nubian

twelve

attributes
to
the

the
law
which
fixed
the
pay
at
this
rate
the

were
not
taxed
and
were
exempt
from
forced
labour
during
the
time
that
they
were
away
from
home
on
active
service
with
this
exception
they
were
liable
to
the
same
charges
as
the
rest
of
the
population
many
among
them
possessed
no
other
income
and
lived
the
precarious
life
of

it
is
difficult
to
say
if
this
law
of
perpetual
change
was
always
in
force
at
any
rate
it
did
not
prevent
the
soldiers
from
forming
themselves
in
time
into
a
kind
of
aristocracy
which
even
kings
and
barons
of
highest
rank
could
not
ignore
they
were
enrolled
in
special
registers
with
the
indication
of
the

was

assigned

its
advantages
however
trifling
they

appear

us
seemed
in
the
eyes
of
the

so
great
that
for
the
most
part
those
who
were
engaged
in

had
their
children
also
enrolled

the
latter
were
taken

the

the

the

were

prepared

and
brandishing

bows

in
the

training

distributed
among
them
and
they
were
conveyed
in
boats
to
the
scene
of
action
the
egyptians
were
not
martial
by
temperament
they
became
soldiers
rather
from
interest
than
inclination
the
power
of
pharaoh
and
his
barons
rested
entirely
upon
these
two
classes
the
priests
and
the
soldiers
the
remainder
the
commonalty
and
the
peasantry
were
in
their
hands
merely
an
inert
mass
to
be
taxed
and
subjected
to
forced
labour
at
will
the
slaves
were
probably
regarded
as
of
little
importance
the
bulk
of
the
people
consisted
of
free
families
who
were
at
liberty
to
dispose
of
themselves
and
their
goods
every
fellah
and
townsman
in
the
service
of
the
king
or
of
one
of
his
great
nobles
could
leave
his
work
and
his
village
when
he
pleased
could
pass
from
the
domain
in
which
he
was
born
into
a
different
one
and
could
traverse
the
country
from
one
end
to
the
other
as
the
egyptians
of
still
do
his
absence
entailed
neither
loss
of
goods
nor
persecution
of
the
relatives
he
left
behind
and
he
himself
had
punishment
to
fear
only
when
he
left
the
nile
valley
without
permission
to
reside
for
some
time
in
a
foreign
land
but
although
this
independence
and
liberty
were
in
accordance
with
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
land
yet
they
gave
rise
to
inconveniences
from
which
it
was
difficult
to
escape
in
practical
life
every
egyptian
the
king
excepted
was
obliged
in
order
to
get
on
in
life
to
depend
on
one
more
powerful
than
himself
whom
he
called
his
master
the
feudal
lord
was
proud
to
recognize
pharaoh
as
his
master
and
he
himself
was
master
of
the
soldiers
and
priests
in
his
own
petty
state
the
treaty
between
ramses
and
the
prince
of
khiti
contains
a
formal
extradition
clause
in
reference
to
egyptians
or
hittites
who
had
quitted
their
native
country
of
course
without
the
permission
of
their
sovereign
the
two
contracting
parties
expressly
stipulate
that
persons
extradited
on
one
side
or
the
other
shall
not
be
punished
for
having
emigrated
that
their
property
is
not
to
be
confiscated
nor
are
their
families
to
be
held
responsible
for
their
flight
from
this
clause
it
follows
that
in
ordinary
times
unauthorized
emigration
brought
upon
the
culprit
corporal
punishment
and
the
confiscation
of
his
goods
as
well
as
various
penalties
on
his
family
the
way
in
which
sinûhît
makes
excuses
for
his
flight
the
fact
of
his
asking
pardon
before
returning
to
egypt
the
very
terms
of
the
letter
in
which
the
king
recalls
him
and
assures
him
of
impunity
show
us
that
the
laws
against
emigration
were
in
full
force
under
the
xiith
dynasty
the
expressions
which
bear
witness
to
this
fact
are
very
numerous

so
frequently

in
the
case
of
persons
of
all
ranks
that
it
was
thought
no
importance
ought
to
be
attached
to
them
but
the
constant
repetition
of
the
word
nib
shows
that
we
must
alter
this
view
and
give
these
phrases
their
full
meaning
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
social
scale
every
free
man
acknowledged
a
master
who
secured
to
him
justice
and
protection
in
exchange
for
his
obedience
and
fealty
the
moment
an
egyptian
tried
to
withdraw
himself
from
this
subjection
the
peace
of
his
life
was
at
an
end
he
became
a
man
without
a
master
and
therefore
without
a

to
me
to
be
taken
from
the
practice
of
the
trade

his
elbow
raised
when
shaving
and
lowers
it
when
he
is

this
passage
is
conjecturally
translated
i
suppose
the
egyptian
masons
had
a
custom
analogous
to
that
of
our
own
and
attached
a
bunch
of
lotus
to
the
highest
part
of
a
building
they
had
just
finished
nothing
however
has
come
to
light
to
confirm
this
conjecture
his
two
arms
are
worn
out
with
work
his
provisions
are
placed
higgledy
piggledy
amongst
his
refuse
he
consumes
himself
for
he
has
no
other
bread
than
his
fingers
and
he
becomes
wearied
all
at
he
is
much
and
dreadfully
exhausted
for
there
is
always
a
block
to
be
dragged
in
this

that

block
of
ten
cubits

there
is
always
a
block
to
be
dragged
in

that

far
as

is
fixed
the
bunch
of
on
the
completed
when
the
work
is
quite
finished
if
he
has
bread
he
returns
home
and
his
children
have
been
beaten
unmercifully
during
his
absence
the
weaver
within
doors
is
worse
off
there
than
a
woman
squatting
his
knees
against
his
chest
he
does
not
if
during
the
day
he
slackens
weaving
he
is
bound
fast
as
the
lotuses
of
the
lake
and
it
is

giving
bread
to

would
be

by

the

brought

belong
to
the

type

back

may
therefore
assume
the

periods

the
side
of
the
main

we
see
two
corn
granaries
with
conical
roofs

a

were
grouped
around
one

more
temples

of
which
was
surrounded
by
its
own
brick

its
enormous

dwelt
there
in

also
from
great
distances
in

in

the
people
occupied
mentioned
by

the
religious
ceremony
was
accompanied
by
a
general
illumination
which
lasted
all
the

the
object
of
this
probably
was
to
facilitate
the
visit
which
the

of
the

were
supposed
to
pay
at
this

crudely
enough
called
this
the
of
from
what
we
know
of
the
earlier
epochs
we
are
justified
in
making
this
description
a
general
one
and
in
applying
it
as
i
have
done
here
to
the
festivals
of
other
towns
besides
dendera
the
nights
were
as
noisy
as
the
days
for
a
few
hours
they
made
up
energetically
for
long
months
of
torpor
and
monotonous
existence
the
god
having
the
temple
and
the
pilgrims
taken
their
departure
the
regular
routine
was
resumed
and
dragged
on
its
tedious
course
interrupted
only
by
the
weekly
market
at
an
early
hour
on
that
day
the
peasant
folk
came
in
from
the
surrounding
country
in
an
interminable
stream
and
installed
themselves
in
some
open
space
reserved
from
time
immemorial
for
their
use
the
sheep
geese
goats
and
cattle
were
grouped
in
the
centre
awaiting
purchasers
fishermen
fowlers
and
potters
and
small
tradesmen
squatted
on
the
roadsides
or
against
the
houses
and
offered
their
wares
for
the
inspection
of
their
customers
heaped
up
in
reed
baskets
or
piled
on
low
round
tables
vegetables
and

or

baked

the
night
meat
either
raw
or
cooked
in
various
ways
stuffs
perfumes

all
the
necessities
and
luxuries
of
daily
life
it
was
a
good
opportunity
for
the
workpeople
as
well
as
for
the
townsfolk
to
lay
in
a
store
of
provisions
at
a
cheaper
rate
than
from
the
ordinary
shops
and
they
took
advantage
of
it
each
according
to
his
means
business
was
mostly
carried
on
by
barter
the
purchasers
brought
with
them
some
product
of
their
toil
a
new
tool
a
pair
of
shoes
a
reed
mat
pots
of
unguents
or

copper
silver
or
even
gold
all
destined
to
be
bartered
for
such
things
as
they
needed
when
it
came
to
be
a
question
of
some
large
animal
or
of
objects
of
considerable
value
the
discussions
which
arose
were
keen
and
stormy
it
was
necessary
to
be
agreed
not
only
as
to
the
amount
but
as
to
the
nature
of
the
payment
to
be
made
and
to
draw
up
a
sort
of
invoice
or
in
fact
an
inventory
in
which
beds
sticks
honey
oil
and
garments
all
figure
as
equivalents
for
a
bull
or
a
smaller
retail
bargains
did
not
demand
so
many
or
such
complicated
calculations
two
townsfolk
stop
for
a
moment
in
front
of
a
fellah
who
offers
onions
and
corn
in
a
basket
for
sale
the
first
appears
to
possess
no
other
circulating
medium
than
two
necklaces
made
of
glass
beads
or
enamelled
the
other
flourishes
about
a
circular
fan
with
a
wooden
handle
and
one
of
those
triangular
contrivances
used
by
cooks
for
blowing
up
the
fire
is
a
fine
necklace
which
will
suit
you
cries
the
former
is
just
what
you
are
wanting
while
the
other
breaks
in
with
is
a
fan
and
a
the
fellah
however
does
not
let
himself
be
disconcerted
by
this
double
attack
and
proceeding
methodically
he
takes
one
of
the
necklaces
to
examine
it
at
his
leisure
it
to
me
to
look
at
that
i
may
fix
the
the
one
asks
too
much
the
other
offers
too
little
after
many
concessions
they
at
last
come
to
an
agreement
and
settle
on
the
number
of
onions
or
the
quantity
of
grain
which
corresponds
exactly
with
the
value
of
the
necklace
or
the
fan
a
little

on
a
customer
wishes
to
get
some
perfumes
in
exchange
for

conscientiously
praises
his
wares

the
merchant
has
no
wish
to
be
shod
just
then
and
demands
a
row
of
cowries

his
little

merely
to
take
a
few
drops
of
this

two

formed

not
always

were
often

were

illustration
one
of
the
forms
of
egyptian
scales
drawn
by
after
a
sketch
by
rosellini
they
had
to
be
weighed
at
every
fresh
transaction
in
order
to
estimate
their
true
value
and
the
interested
parties
never
missed
this
excellent
opportunity
for
a
heated
discussion
after
having
declared
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
that
the
scales
were
out
of
order
that
the
weighing
had
been
carelessly
performed
and
that
it
should
be
done
over
again
they
at
last
came
to
terms
exhausted
with
wrangling
and
then
went
their
way
fairly
satisfied
with
one
another
it
sometimes
happened
that
a
clever
and
unscrupulous
dealer
would
alloy
the
rings
and
mix
with
the
precious
metal
as
much
of
a
baser
sort
as
would
be
possible
without
danger
of
detection
the
honest
merchant
who
thought
he
was
receiving
in
payment
for
some
article
say
eight
tabnû
of
fine
gold
and
who
had
handed
to
him
eight
tabnû
of
some
alloy
resembling
gold
but
containing
of
silver
lost
in
a
single
transaction
without
suspecting
it
almost
of
his
goods
the
fear
of
such
counterfeits
was
instrumental
in
restraining
the
use
of
tabnû
for
a
long
time
among
the
people
and
restricted
the
buying
and
selling
in
the
markets
to
exchange
in
natural
products
or
manufactured
objects
the
weighing
of
rings
is
often
represented
on
the
monuments
from
the
xviiith
dynasty
onwards
i
am
not
acquainted
with
any
instance
of
this
on
the
of
the
ancient
empire
the
giving
of
false
weight
is
alluded
to
in
the
paragraph
in
the
confession
in
which
the
dead
man
declares
that
he
has
not

we
must
perhaps
agree
with
fr
lenormant
in
his
conclusion
that
the
only
kind
of
national
metal
of
exchange
in
use
in
egypt
was
a
copper

this

scarcely
ever
live
in

and
scattered

they
are
almost
all
concentrated
in
hamlets
and
villages
of
considerable
extent
divided
into
quarters
often
at
some
distance
from
each

the

state
of

in
ancient
times

those
who
would

what
a

they
were
not
everywhere
subjected
to
the

degree
of
servitude
the
slaves
properly
so
called
came
from
other
countries
they
had
been
bought
from
foreign
merchants
or
they
had
been

in

they
worked
for
him
under
his

receiving
no

with
no

recovering

the
first
allusion
to
prisoners

in

a

some

foreigners
in

we
may
form
some
idea
of
the
number
of
slaves
in
egypt
from
the
fact
that
in
thirty
years
ramses

whether
it
was
regularly

situated
above
the
highest
rise
of
the
water
and
consequently
dependent
on
a
more
or
less
costly
system
of
artificial
irrigation
all
this
was
so
much
information
of
which
the
scribes
took
advantage
in
regulating
the
assessment
of
the
everything
tends
to
make
us
believe
that
this
tax
represented
of
the
gross
produce
but
the
amount
of
the
latter
varied
it
depended
on
the
annual
rise
of
the
nile
and
it
followed
the
course
of
it
with
almost
mathematical
exactitude
if
there
were
too
much
or
too
little
water
it
was
immediately
lessened
and
might
even
be
reduced
to
nothing
in
extreme
cases
the
king
in
his
capital
and
the
great
lords
in
their
fiefs
had
set
up
by
means
of
which
in
the
critical
weeks
the
height
of
the
rising
or
subsiding
flood
was
taken
daily
messengers
carried
the
news
of
it
over
the
country
the
people
kept
regularly
informed
of
what
was
happening
soon
knew
what
kind
of
season
to
expect
and
they
could
calculate
to
within
very
little
what
they
would
have
to
pay
in
theory
the
collecting
of
the
tax
was
based
on
the
actual
amount
of
land
covered
by
the
water
and
the
produce
of
it
was
constantly
varying
in
practice
it
was
regulated
by
taking
the
average
of
preceding
years
and
deducting
from
that
a
fixed
sum
which
was
never
departed
from
except
in
extraordinary
circumstances
we
know
that
this
was
so
in
so
far
as
the
roman
period
is
concerned
from
a
passage
in
the
edict
of
tiberius
alexander
the
practice
was
such
a
natural
one
that
i
have
no
hesitation
in
tracing
it
back
to
the
time
of
the
ancient
empire
repeatedly
condemned
as
a
piece
of
bad
administration
it
reappeared
continually
at
the
nomarch
amoni
boasts
that
there
had
been
abundant
niles
and
the
owners
of
wheat
and
barley
crops
had
thriven
he
had
not
increased
the
rate
of
the
which
seems
to
indicate
that
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
had
fixed
the
tax
to
pay
his
dues
without
difficulty

the

the

would
have
to
be
a
very
bad
one
before
the
authorities
would
lower

rate
the
state

ancient

was
not
more
willing
to
deduct
anything
from
its
revenue

the
modern

it
would
seem
that
the
previous
deduction
of
of
the
gross
amount
of
the

could
not
be
a
heavy
burden

that
the
wretched

to
have
been
in
a
position
on

at
a
permanent
figure
based
on
the
average
of
good
and
bad
harvests
it
was
not
so

and
the
same
writers
who
have
given
us
such
a
lamentable
picture
of
the
condition
of
the
workmen
in
the
towns
have
painted
for
us
in
even
darker
colours
the
miseries
which
overwhelmed
the

not

picture
of

have
destroyed
half
of
the
wheat
and
the
hippopotami

are

are
worn
out

the
team
has
died

is
then
that
the

steps
out

there
come

come
and
cut
their
wheat
before

root
up
their
vegetables

still
immature
the

kind
of
torture
is
mentioned
in

the
lawless

are
represented

treatment
was
still
resorted
to
in
egypt
not
long
ago
in
order
to
extract
money
from
those
taxpayers
whom
beatings
had
failed
to
bring
to
reason
one
might
be
tempted
to
declare
that
the
picture
is
too
dark
a
one
to
be
true
did
one
not
know
from
other
sources
of
the
brutal
ways
of
filling
the
treasury
which
egypt
has
retained
even
to
the
present
day

they
had
to
work
out
in
forced
labour
the
amount
which
they
had
failed
to
pay

current
merchandise

is
evident
from
a
passage
in

speak
the
majority
of
the
questions
were
decided
in
a
few
minutes
by
a
judgment
by
which
there
was
no
appeal
only
the
more
serious
cases
necessitated
a
and
prolonged
discussion
all
else
was
carried
on
before
this
patriarchal
jury
as
in
our
own
courts
of
justice
except
that
the
inevitable
stick
too
often
elucidated
the
truth
and
cut
short
discussions
the
depositions
of
the
witnesses
the
speeches
on
both
sides
the
examination
of
the
documents
could
not
proceed
without
the
frequent
taking
of
oaths
the
life
of
the
or
the
favour
of
the
gods
in
which
the
truth
often
suffered
severely
penalties
were
varied

bastinado
imprisonment

for
the
corvée
and
for
grave
offences
forced

of

and

and
finally
death
by
strangulation
by
beheading
by
empalement
and
at
the
stake
the
only
known
instance
of
an
execution
by
hanging
is
that

in

see

human
victims
executed

mentioned
in

of

permission
to
carry

themselves
the
sentence
passed
upon
them
and
thus
avoided
by
suicide
the
shame
of
public
execution
before
tribunals
thus
constituted
the
fellah
who
came
to
appeal
against
the
exactions
of
which
he
was
the
victim
had
little
chance
of
obtaining
a
hearing
had
not
the
scribe
who
had
overtaxed
him
or
who
had
imposed
a
fresh
corvée
upon
him
the
right
to
appear
among
the
judges
to
whom
he
addressed
himself
nothing
indeed
prevented
him
from
appealing
from
the
latter
to
his
feudal
lord
and
from
him
to
pharaoh
but
such
an
appeal
would
be
for
him
a
mere
delusion
when
he
had
left
his
village
and
presented
his
petition
he
had
many
delays
to
encounter
before
a
solution
could
be
arrived
at
and
if
the
adverse
party
were
at
all
in
favour
at
court
or
could
command
any
influence
the
sovereign
decision
would
confirm
even
if
it
did
not
aggravate
the
sentence
of
the
previous
judges
in
the
mean
while
the
land
remained
uncultivated
his
wife
and
children
bewailed
their
wretchedness
and
the
last
resources
of
the
family
were
consumed
in
proceedings
and
delays
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
at
the
outset
to
have
made
up
his
mind
to
submit
without
resistance
to
a
fate
from
which
he
could
not
escape
in
spite
of
taxes
requisitions
and
forced
labour
the
fellahîn
came
off
fairly
well
when
the
chief
to
whom
they
belonged
proved
a
kind
master
and
did
not
add
the
exactions
of
his
own
personal
caprice
to
those
of
the
state
the
inscriptions
which
princes
caused
to
be
devoted
to
their
own
glorification

enthusiastic
panegyrics

only
with
their
uprightness

kindness
towards
the
poor

himself
as
faultless

the

which
at

about

was
at

reduced

when
pharaoh
had
need
of
a
greater
quantity

a

elevation
according
to
the
fortune
of
the
deceased
or
of
his

no
satisfactory
etymon
for
the

has
as

been

the
least
is
that
put
forward
by

to
which
is

form

in

mathematical
phraseology
designates
the
the

the
word

designates
a
pyramid
in
the
texts
is
elsewhere
applied
to
the
tombs
of
nobles
and
commoners
as
well
as
to
those
of
kings
the
fashion
of
burying
in
a
pyramid
was
not
adopted
in
the
environs
of
memphis
until
tolerably
late
times
and
the
pharaohs
of
the
primitive
dynasties
were
interred
as
their
subjects
were
in
sepulchral
chambers
of
mastabas
zosiri
was
the
only
exception
if
the
of
saqqâra
as
is
probable
served
for
his
tomb
it
is
difficult
to
admit
that
a
pyramid
of
considerable
dimensions
could
have
disappeared
without
leaving
any
traces
behind
especially
when
we
see
the
enormous
masses
of
masonry
which
still
mark
the
sites
of
those
which
have
been
most
injured
besides
the
inscriptions
connect
none
of
the
predecessors
of
snofrûi
with
a
pyramid
unless
it
be
zosiri
the
of
saqqâra
which
is
attributed
to
the
latter
belongs
to
the
same
type
as
that
of
mêdûm
so
does
also
the
pyramid
of
rigah
whose
occupant
is
unknown
if
we
admit
that
this
pyramid
served
as
a
tomb
to
some
intermediate
pharaoh

zosiri
and
snofrûi

the
use
of
pyramids
would
be
merely
exceptional
for
sovereigns
anterior
to
the
ivth

the
motive
which
determined
choice
of
mêdûm
as
a
site
is
unknown
to
us
perhaps
he
dwelt
in
that
city
of
heracleopolis
which
in
course
of
time
frequently
became
the
favourite
residence
of
the
kings
perhaps
he
improvised
for
himself
a
city
in
the
plain
between
and
kafr

pyramid
at
the
present
time
is
composed
of
three
large
unequal
cubes

inclined
sides

a
progressive
increase
of
the
total

we

of

angle
from

to

brought
it
into
conformity
with
the
type
of

the
passage
had
its
orifice
in
the
middle
of
the
north

about
sixty
feèt
above

the

to

was
probably
therefore
one

most
popular
kings
of
the
good

times
but
his
fame
however
great
it
may
have
been
among
the

has
been
eclipsed
in

eyes
by
that
of
the
pharaohs

immediately
followed

kheops
khephren

mykerinos
not
that
we
are
really
better
acquainted
with
their
history
all
we
know
of
them
is
made
up
of
two
or
three
series
of
facts
always
the
same
which
the
contemporaneous
monuments
teach
us
concerning
these
rulers
abbreviated
into
khûfûi
the
of
the
greeks
was
probably
the
son
of
snofrûi
the
existence
of
the
two
cartouches
khûfûi
and
khûfûi
on
the
same
monuments
has
caused
much
embarrassment
to
egyptologists
the
majority
have
been
inclined
to
see
here
two
different
kings
the
second

whom
according

have

bore

this

a
title
of
honour
and

nothing

few
records
which
we
have
of

give
one

the
impression
that
kheops
was
the
son
of

that

that

this

so
placed
that
it
must
have
been

up
at
the

believe
therefore
that
the
restoration
effected
by

according
to
the

was
merely
a
clearing
away
of
the

from
the

to

accomplished

the

me
to
believe
that

of

must
be
almost
contemporaneous
with
the

is
to
say
that
they
had
been
hollowed
out

the

this

so
much

he
does
not
appear
so
far
removed
from
humanity
as
his
predecessor
and
the
expression
of
his
countenance
agrees
somewhat
singularly
with
the
account
of
his
piety
and
good
nature
preserved
by
the
legends
the
egyptians
of
the
theban
dynasties
when
comparing
the
two
great
pyramids
with
the
third
imagined
that
the
disproportion
in
their
size
corresponded
with
a
difference
of
character
between
their
royal
occupants
accustomed
as
they
were
from
infancy
to
gigantic
structures
they
did
not
experience
before
and
the
feeling
of
wonder
and
awe
which
impresses
the
beholder
of
they
were
not
the
less
apt
on
this
account
to
estimate
the
amount
of
labour
and
effort
required
to
complete
them
from
top
to
bottom
this
labour
seemed
to
them
to
surpass
the
most
excessive
corvée
which
a
just
ruler
had
a
right
to
impose
upon
his
subjects
and
the
reputation
of
kheops
and
khephren
suffered
much
in
consequence
they
were
accused
of
sacrilege
of
cruelty
and
profligacy

that

the
whole

people
for
more
than
a
century
for
the
erection

kheops
began
by
closing
the
temples
and
by
prohibiting
the
offering
of
sacrifices
he
then
compelled
all
the
egyptians
to
work
for
him
to
some
he
assigned
the
task
of
dragging
the
blocks
from
the
quarries
of
the

chain

once
shipped
the
duty
was
incumbent
on

as
the
libyan
chain
a
hundred
thousand
men
worked
at
a
time
and
were
relieved
every
three
months
professor
petrie
thinks
that
this
detail
rests
upon
an
authentic
tradition
the
inundation
he
says
lasts
three
months
during
which
the
mass
of
the
people
have
nothing
to
do
it
was
during
these
three
months
that
kheops
raised
the
men
to
work
at
the
transport
of
the
stone
the
explanation
is
very
ingenious
but
it
is
not
supported
by
the
text
herodotus
does
not
relate
that
men
were
called
by
the
corvée
for
three
months
every
year
but
from
three
months
to
three
months
possibly
four
times
a
year
bodies

relieved
each
other
at
the

the

he
quotes

must
leave
the
responsibility
for
them
to

was
divided
as

ten
years
in
making

a
work
in
my
opinion
very
little
less
onerous
than
that
of
erecting

eight

presented

might
be

the
whole

of

to

or
rather
the
account
of
the
discovery
of
a
under
kheops
is
quite
in
conformity
with
egyptian
ideas
the
british
museum
possesses
two
books
which
were
thus
discovered
under
this
king
the
one
a
medical
treatise
in
a
temple
at

the
other
comes
from
tanis
among
the
works
on
alchemy
published
by
berthelot
there
are
two
small
treatises
ascribed
to
sophé
possibly
souphis
or
kheops
they
are
of
the
same
kind
as
the
book
mentioned
by
manetho
and
which
syncellus
says
was
bought
in
egypt
khephren
had
imitated
and
thus
shared
with
him
the
hatred
of
posterity
the
egyptians
avoided
naming
these
wretches
their
work
was
attributed
to
a
shepherd
called
philitis
who
in
ancient
times
pastured
his
flocks
in
the
mountain
and
even
those
who
did
not
refuse
to
them
the
glory
of
having
built
the
most
enormous
sepulchres
in
the
world
related
that
they
had
not
the
satisfaction
of
reposing
in
them
after
their
death
the
people
exasperated
at
the
tyranny
to
which
they
had
been
subject
swore
that
they
would
tear
the
bodies
of
these
pharaohs
from
their
tombs
and
scatter
their
fragments
to
the
winds
they
had
to
be
buried
in
crypts
so
securely
placed
that
no
one
has
succeeded
in
finding
them
like
the
two
older
pyramids
had
its
anecdotal
history
in
which
the
egyptians
gave
free
rein
to
their
imagination
we
know
that
its
plan
had
been
rearranged
in
the
course
of
building
that
it
contained
two
sepulchral
chambers
two
sarcophagi
and
two
mummies
these
modifications
it
was
said
belonged
to
two
distinct
reigns
for
mykerinos
had
left
his
tomb
unfinished
and
a
woman
had
finished
it
at
a
later
date

last
queen
of
the
vith
dynasty
according
to
others
rhodopis
the
ionian
who
was
the
mistress
of
psammetichus
or
of
ainasis
zoega
had
already
recognized
that
the
rhodopis
of
the
greeks
was
no
other
than
the
nitokris
of
manetho
and
his
opinion
was
adopted
and
developed
by
bunsen
the
legend
of
rhodopis
was
completed
by
the
additional
ascription
to
the
ancient
egyptian
queen
of
the
character
of
a
courtesan
this
repugnant
trait
seems
to
have
been
borrowed
from
the
same
class
of
legends
as
that
which
concerned
itself
with
the
daughter
of
kheops
and
her
pyramid
the
narrative
thus
developed
was
in
a
similar
manner
confounded
with
another
popular
story
in
which
occurs
the
episode
of
the
slipper
so
well
known
from
the
tale
of
cinderella
herodotus
connects
rhodopis
with
his
amasis
ælian
with
king
psammetichus
of
the
xxvith
dynasty
the
beauty
and
richness
of
the
granite
casing
dazzled
all
eyes
and
induced
many
visitors
to
prefer
the
least
of
the
pyramids
to
its
two
imposing
sisters
its
comparatively
small
size
is
excused
on
the
ground
that
its
founder
had
returned
to
that
moderation
and
piety
which
ought
to
characterize
a
good
king
actions
of
his
father
were
not
pleasing
to
him
he
reopened
the
temples
and
sent
the
people
reduced
to
the
extreme
of
misery
back
to
their
religious
observances
and
their
occupations
finally
he
administered
justice
more
equitably
than
all
other
kings
on
this
head
he
is
praised
above
those
who
have
at
any
time
reigned
in
egypt
for
not
only
did
he
administer
good
justice
but
if
any
one
complained
of
his
decision
he
gratified
him
with
some
present
in
order
to
appease
his
there
was
one
point
however
which
excited
the
anxiety
of
many
in
a
country
where
the
mystic
virtue
of
numbers
was
an
article
of
faith
in
order
that
the
laws
of
celestial
arithmetic
should
be
observed
in
the
construction
of
the
pyramids
it
was
necessary
that
three
of
them
should
be
of
the
same
size
the
anomaly
of
a
third
pyramid
out
of
proportion
to
the
two
others
could
be
explained
only
on
the
hypothesis
that
mykerinos
having
broken
with
paternal
usage
had
ignorantly
infringed
a
decree
of
destiny
a
deed
for
which
he
was
mercilessly
punished
he
first
lost
his
only
daughter
a
short
time
after
he
learned
from
an
oracle
that
he
had
only
six
more
years
to
remain
upon
the
earth
he
enclosed
the
corpse
of
his
child
in
a
hollow
wooden
heifer
which
he
sent
to
sais
where
it
was
honoured
with
divine
worship
herodotus
ii
the
manner
in
which
herodotus
describes
the
cow
which
was
shown
to
him
in
the
temple
of
sais
proves
that
he
was
dealing
with
nit
in
animal
form
the
great
celestial
heifer
who
had
given
birth
to
the
sun
how
the
people
could
have
attached
to
this
statue
the
legend
of
a
daughter
of
mykerinos
is
now
difficult
to
understand
the
idea
of
a
mummy
or
a
corpse
shut
up
in
a
statue
or
in
a
coffin
was
familiar
to
the
egyptians
two
of
the
queens
interred
at
déir
nofritari
ahhotpû
were
found
hidden
in
the
centre
of
immense
osirian
figures
of
wood
covered
with
stuccoed
fabric
egyptian
tradition
supposed
that
the
bodies
of
the
gods
rested
upon
the
earth
the
cow
might
therefore
be
bodily
enclosed
in
a
sarcophagus
in
the
form
of
a
heifer
just
as
the
mummified
gazelle
of
déîr
is
enclosed
in
a
sarcophagus
of
gazelle
form
it
is
even
possible
that
the
statue
shown
to
herodotus
really
contained
what
was
thought
to
be
a
mummy
of
the
goddess
then
communicated
his
reproaches
to
the
god
complaining
that
his
father
and
his
uncle
after
having
closed
the
temples
forgotten
the
gods
and
oppressed
mankind
had
enjoyed
a
long
life
while
he
devout
as
he
was
was
so
soon
about
to
perish
the
oracle
answered
that
it
was
for
this
very
reason
that
his
days
were
shortened
for
he
had
not
done
that
which
he
ought
to
have
done
egypt
had
to
suffer
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
and
the
two
kings
his
predecessors
had
known
this
while
he
had
not
on
receiving
this
answer
mykerinos
feeling
himself
condemned
manufactured
a
number
of
lamps
lit
them
every
evening
at
dusk
began
to
drink
and
to
lead
a
life
of
jollity
without
ceasing
for
a
moment
night
and
day
wandering
by
the
lakes
and
in
the
woods
wherever
he
thought
to
find
an
occasion
of
pleasure
he
had
planned
this
in
order
to
convince
the
oracle
of
having
spoken
falsely
and
to
live
twelve
years
the
nights
counting
as
so
many
legend
places
after
him
asychis
or
sasychis
a
later
builder
of
pyramids
but
of
a
different
kind
the
latter
preferred
brick
as
a
building
material
except
in
one
place
where
he
introduced
a
stone
bearing
the
following
inscription
not
despise
me
on
account
of

stone
pyramids
i
surpass
them
as
much
as

the
other
gods
because
a
pole
being
plunged
into
a
lake
and
the
clay
which
stuck
to
it
being
collected
the
brick
out
of
which
i
was
constructed
was
moulded
from
the
virtues
of
asychis
and
mykerinos
helped
to
counteract
the
bad
impression
which
kheops
and
khephren
had
left
behind
them
among
the
five
legislators
of
egypt
asychis
stood
out
as
one
of
the
best
he
regulated
to
minute
details
the
ceremonies
of
worship
he
invented
geometry
and
the

i
it
seems
probable
that
diodorus
had
received
knowledge
from
some
alexandrian
writer
now
lost
of
traditions
concerning
the
legislative
acts
of
shashanqû
of
the
xxiind
dynasty
but
the
name
of
the
king
commonly
written
sesonkhis
had
been
corrupted
by
the
dragoman
into
sasykhis
he
put
forth
a
law
on
lending
in
which
he
authorized
the
borrower
to
pledge
in
forfeit
the
mummy
of
his
father
while
the
creditor
had
the
right
of
treating
as
his
own
the
tomb
of
the
debtor
so
that
if
the
debt
was
not
met
the
latter
could
not
obtain
a
last
for
himself
or
his
family
either
in
his
paternal
or
any
other
tomb
history
knows
nothing
either
of
this
judicious
sovereign
or
of
many
other
pharaohs
of
the
same
type
which
the
dragomans
of
the
greek
period
assiduously
enforced
upon
the
respectful
attention
of
travellers
it
merely
affirms
that
the
example
given
by
kheops
khephren
and
mykerinos
were
by
no
means
lost
in
later
times
from
the
beginning
of
the
ivth
to
the
end
of
the
xivth
dynasty
during
more
than
fifteen
hundred
years
the
construction
of
pyramids
was
a
common
state
affair
provided
for
by
the
administration
secured
by
special
services
not
only
did
the
pharaohs
build
them
for
themselves
but
the
princes
and
princesses
belonging
to
the
family
of
the
pharaohs
constructed
theirs
each
one
according
to
his
resources
three
of
these
secondary
mausoleums
are
ranged
opposite
the
eastern
side
of

three
opposite
the
southern
face
of

everywhere
else
near
abousir
at
saqqâra
at
dahshur
or
in
the
fayûm
the
majority
of
the
royal
pyramids
attracted
around
them
a
more
or
less
numerous
cortège
of
pyramids
of
princely
foundation
often
debased
in
shape
and
faulty
in
proportion
the
materials
for
them
were
brought
from
the
arabian
chain
a
spur
of
the
latter
projecting
in
a
straight
line
towards
the
nile
as
far
as
the
village
of
troiû
is
nothing
but
a
mass
of
the
finest
and
whitest
limestone
the
egyptians
had
quarries
here
from
the
earliest
times
by
cutting
off
the
stone
in
every
direction
they
lowered
the
point
of
this
spur
for
a
depth
of
some
hundreds
of
metres
the
appearance
of
these
quarries
is
almost
as
astonishing
as
that
of
the
monuments
made
out
of
their
material
the
extraction
of
the
stone
was
carried
on
with
a
skill
and
regularity
which
denoted
ages
of
experience
the
tunnels
were
so
made
as
to
exhaust
the
finest
and
whitest
seams
without
waste
and
the
chambers
were
of
an
enormous
extent
the
walls
were
dressed
the
pillars
and
roofs
neatly
finished
the
passages
and
doorways
made
of
a
regular
width
so
that
the
whole
presented
more
the
appearance
of
a
subterranean
temple
than
of
a
place
for
the
extraction
of
building
materials
the
description
of
the
quarries
of
turah
as
they
were
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
was
somewhat
briefly
given
by
jomard
afterwards
more
completely
by
perring
during
the
last
thirty
years
the
cairo
masons
have
destroyed
the
greater
part
of
the
ancient
remains
formerly
existing
in
this
district

have
completely
changed

true

are
to
be
found
set
apart
in

place
recording
that
after
a
long
interruption
such
or
such
an
illustrious
sovereign
had
resumed
the
excavations
and
opened
fresh
chambers
alabaster
was
met
with
not
far
from
here
in

the
pharaohs
of
very
early
times
established
a
regular
colony
here
in
the
very
middle
of
the
desert
to
cut
the
material
into
small
blocks
for
transport
a
strongly
built
dam
thrown
across
the
valley
served
to
store
up
the
winter
and
spring
rains
and
formed
a
pond
whence
the
workers
could
always
supply
themselves
with
water
kheops
and
his
successors
drew
their
alabaster
from
hâtnûbû
in
the
neighbourhood
of
hermopolis
their
granite
from
syene
their
diorite
and
other
hard
rocks
the
favourite
material
for
their
sarcophagi
from
the
volcanic
valleys
which
separate
the
nile
from
the
red
sea
especially
from

hammamât
as
these
were
the
only
materials
of
which
the
quantity
required
could
not
be
determined
in
advance
and
which
had
to
be
brought
from
a
distance
every
king
was
accustomed
to
send
the
principal
persons
of
his
court
to
the
quarries
of
upper
egypt
and
the
rapidity
with
which
they
brought
back
the
stone
constituted
a
high
claim
on
the
favour
of
their
master
if
the
building
was
to
be
of
brick
the
bricks
were
made
on
the
spot
in
the
plain
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
if
it
was
to
be
a
limestone
structure
the
neighbouring
parts
of
the
plateau
furnished
the
rough
material
in
abundance
for
the
construction
of
chambers
and
for
casing
walls
the
rose
granite
of
elephantine
and
the
limestone
of
troiu
were
commonly
employed
but
they
were
spared
the
labour
of
procuring
these
specially
for
the
occasion
the
city
of
the
white
wall
had
always
at
hand
a
supply
of
them
in
its
stores
and
they
might
be
drawn
upon
freely
for
public
buildings
and
consequently
for
the
royal
tomb
the
blocks
chosen
from
this
reserve
and
conveyed
in
boats
close
under

drawn
up

inclined

arrangements
the
length
of
the
passages
and
the
height
of
the
pyramids
varied
much
the
least
of
them
had
a
height
of
some
feet
merely
as
it
is
difficult
to
determine
the
motives
which
influenced
the
pharaohs
in
building
them
of
different
sizes
some
writers
have
thought
that
the
mass
of
each
increased
in
proportion
to
the
time
bestowed
upon
its
construction
that
is
to
say
to
the
length
of
each
reign
as
soon
as
a
prince
mounted
the
throne
he
would
probably
begin
by
roughly
sketching
out
a
pyramid
sufficiently
capacious
to
contain
the
essential
elements
of
the
tomb
he
would
then
from
year
to
year
have
added
fresh
layers
to
the
original
nucleus
until
the
day
of
his
death
put
an
end
for
ever
to
the
growth
of
the
monument
this
was
the
theory
formulated
by
lepsius
after
the
researches
made
by
himself
and
the
work
done
by
erbkam
and
the
majority
of
egyptologists
adopted
it
and
still
maintain
it
it
was
vigorously
attacked
by
and
by
petrie
it
was
afterwards
revived
with
amendments
by
borchardt
whose
conclusions
have
been
accepted
by

meyer
the
examinations
which
i
have
had
the
opportunity
of
bestowing
on
the
pyramids
of

abusir
dahshur
rîgah
and
lisht
have
shown
me
that
the
theory
is
not
applicable
to
any
of
these
monuments
this
hypothesis
is
not
borne
out
by
facts
such
a
small

as
that

belonged
to
a

who
reigned

years

the

the

like
the

ought
to
present
their

to
the

points

owing
to
unskilfulness
or
negligence
the
majority
of
them
are
not
very
accurately
orientated
and
several
of
them
vary
sensibly
from

the
great
pyramid
of

does
not
describe
a
perfect
square
at
its

is
an
oblong
rectangle

ensure
the
safety
of

the

is
to
respect
the

of

until

to
admit
that

knew
of
a
tradition
ascribing
the
origin
of
the
vth

to
elephantine
the
great
pyramid
is
mute
but
we
find
in

some
hundreds

author
of

united
at
the

by
strong
ligatures

strengthened
at

by
crosspieces

made
it
look

its

i
may
recall
the
fact
that
the
analysis
of
some

discovered
at
mèdûm
by
professor
petrie
proved
that
they
were
made
of
bronze

the

then
peopled
the

were
amongst
the
latest
to
receive
these

they
transmitted
them
either
directly
to
the
egyptians
or
asiatic
intermediaries
who
carried
them

its

perhaps
even
by

far
as

the

between

frequent

their
existence

are
matters

the

an
easy
means
of
access
to
those
who
wished
to
penetrate
into
the
heart
of
africa
the
egyptians
had
at
the
outset
possessed
only
the
northern
extremity
of
the
valley
from
the
sea
to
the
narrow
pass
of
silsileh
they
had
then
advanced
as
far
as
the
first
cataract
and
syene
for
some
time
marked
the
extreme
limit
of
their
empire
at
what
period
did
they
cross
this
second
frontier
and
resume
their
march
southwards
as
if
again
to
seek
the
cradle
of
their
race
they
had
approached
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
great
bend
described
by
the
river
near
the
present
village
of
korosko
but
the
territory
thus
conquered
had
under
the
vth
dynasty
not
as
yet
either
name
or
separate
organization
it
was
a
dependency
of
the
fiefdom
of
elephantine
and
was
under
the
immediate
authority
of
its
princes
this
appears
to
follow
from
a
passage
in
the
inscription
of
uni
this
minister
was
raising
troops
and
exacting
wood
for
building
among
the
desert
tribes
whose
territories
adjoined
at
this
part
of
the

the
manner
in
which
the
requisitions
were
effected
shows
that
it
was
not
a
question
of
a
new
exaction
but
a
familiar
operation
and
consequently
that
the
peoples
mentioned
had
been
under
regular
treaty
obligations
to
the
egyptians
at

for
some
time
previously

natives
who
dwelt
on

to

exactions
when
these
exceeded
all
limits
and
it
became
impossible
to
wink
at
their
misdoings
any
longer
troops
were
sent
against
them
who
quickly
brought
them
to
reason
as
at
sinai
these
were
easy
victories
they
recovered
in
one
expedition
what
the
ûaûaiû
had
stolen
in
ten
both
in
flocks
and
fellahîn
and
the
successful
general
perpetuated
the
memory
of
his
exploits
by
inscribing
as
he
returned
the
name
of
pharaoh
on
some
rock
at
syene
or
elephantine
we
may
surmise
that
it
was
after
this
fashion
that
usirkaf
nofiririkerî
and
unas
carried
on
the
wars
in
nubia
their
armies
probably
never
went
beyond
the
second
cataract
if
they
even
reached
so
far
further
south
the
country
was
only
known
by
the
accounts
of
the
natives
or
by
the
few
merchants
who
had
made
their
way
into
it
beyond
the
mâzaiû
but
still
between
the
nile
and
the
red
sea
lay
the
country
of
pûanît
rich
in
ivory
ebony
gold
metals
gums
and
resins
when
some
egyptian
bolder
than
his
fellows
ventured
to
travel
thither
he
could
choose
one
of
several
routes
for
approaching
it
by
land
or
sea
the
navigation
of
the
red
sea
was
indeed
far
more
frequent
than
is
usually
believed
and
the
same
kind
of
vessels
in
which
the
egyptians
coasted
along
the
mediterranean
conveyed
them
by
following
the
coast
of
africa
as
far
as
the
straits
of
they
preferred
however
to
reach
it
by
land
and
they
returned
with
caravans
of

laden
asses
and
slaves

the

of
the
xviiith
dynasty
recorded
his
victories
over
the
peoples
of
the

of

all
that
lay

was
held
to
be
a
fabulous
region
a
kind
of
intermediate

the

of
the

of
the

of

the

came
into
close

with
the
souls
of
the
departed

was
inhabited
by

tribes
of

reminded

at
court
or
had
others
preceded
it
in
the
good
graces
of
the
pharaohs
his
wildness
and
activity
and
the
extraordinary
positions
which
he
assumed
made
a
lively
impression
upon
the
courtiers
of
the
time
and
nearly
a
century
later
there
were
still
reminiscences
of
him
a
great
official

in
the
time
of

living
on
to
a
great
age
into
the

of

described
on
his
tomb
as
the
of
the
house
of
this
simple
designation
occurring
incidentally
among
two
higher
titles
would
have
been
sufficient
in
itself
to
indicate
the
extraordinary
development
which
egyptian
civilization
had
attained
at
this
time
the
of
was
doubtless
in
the
first
place
a
depository
of
official
documents
such
as
the
registers
of
the
survey
and
taxes
the
correspondence
between
the
court
and
the
provincial
governors
or
feudal
lords
deeds
of
gift
to
temples
or
individuals
and
all
kinds
of
papers
required
in
the
administration
of
the
state
it
contained
i
also
however
literary
works
many
of
which
even
at
this
early
date
were
already
old

drawn
up
during

morals
and
lastly
romances

those
marvellous

which
preceded
the

have
existed
from
prehistoric
times
certain
chapters
excepted
whose
relatively
modern
origin
has
been
indicated
by
those
who
ascribe
the
editing
of
the
work
to
the
time
of
the
first
human
dynasties
all
these
if
we
had
them
would
form
library
much
more
precious
to
us
than
that
of
alexandria
unfortunately
up
to
the
present
we
have
been
able
to
collect
only
insignificant
remains
of
such
rich
stores
in
the
tombs
have
been
found
here
and
there
fragments
of
popular
songs
the
pyramids
have
furnished
almost
intact
a
ritual
of
the
dead
which
is
distinguished
by
its
verbosity
its
numerous
pious
platitudes
and
obscure
allusions
to
things
of
the
other
world
but
among
all
this
trash
are
certain
portions
full
of
movement
and
savage
vigour
in
which
poetic
glow
and
religious
emotion
reveal
their
presence
in
a
mass
of
mythological
phraseology
in
the
berlin
papyrus
we
may
read
the
end
of
a
philosophic
dialogue
between
an
egyptian
and
his
soul
in
which
the
latter
applies
himself
to
show
that
death
has
nothing
terrifying
to
man
say
to
myself
every
day
as
is
the
convalescence
of
a
sick
person
who
goes
to
the
court
after
his
affliction
such
is
death
i
say
to
myself
every
day
as
is
the
inhaling
of
the
scent
of
a
perfume
as
a
seat
under
the
protection
of
an
outstretched
curtain
on
that
day
such
is
death
i
say
to
myself
every
day
as
the
inhaling
of
the
odour
of
a
garden
of
flowers
as
a
seat
upon
the
mountain
of
the
country
of
intoxication
such
is
death
i
say
to
myself
every
day
as
a
road
which
passes
over
the
flood
of
inundation
as
a
man
who
goes
as
a
soldier
whom
nothing
resists
such
is
death
i
say
to
myself
every
day
as
the
clearing
again
of
the
sky
as
a
man
who
goes
out
to
catch
birds
with
a
net
and
suddenly
finds
himself
in
an
unknown
district
such
is
another
papyrus
presented
by
prisse
to
the
paris
contains
the
only
complete
work
of
their
primitive
wisdom
which
has
come
down
to
us
it
was
certainly
transcribed
before
the
xviiith
dynasty
and
contains
the
works
of
two
classic
writers
one
of
whom
is
assumed
to
have
lived
under
the
iiird
and
the
other
under
the
vth
dynasty
it
is
not
without
reason
therefore
that
it
has
been
called
oldest
book
in
the
the
first
leaves
are
wanting
and
the
portion
preserved
has
towards
its
end
the
beginning
of
a
moral
treatise
attributed
to
qaqimnî
a
contemporary
of
hûni
then
followed
a
work
now
lost
one
of
the
ancient
possessors
of
the
papyrus
having
effaced
it
with
the
view
of
substituting
for
it
another
piece
which
was
never
transcribed
the
last
fifteen
pages
are
occupied
by
a
kind
of
pamphlet
which
has
had
a
considerable
reputation
under
the
name
of
the
of
this
phtahhotpû
a
son
flourished
under
menkaûhorû
and
assi
his
tomb
is
still
to
be
seen
in
the
necropolis
of
saqqâra
he
had
sufficient
reputation
to
permit
the
ascription
to
him
without
violence
to
probability
of
the
editing
of
a
collection
of
political
and
moral
maxims
which
indicate
a
profound
knowledge
of
the
court
and
of
men
generally
it
is
supposed
that
he
presented
himself
in
his
declining
years
before
the
pharaoh
assi
exhibited
to
him
the
piteous
state
to
which
old
age
had
reduced
him
and
asked
authority
to
hand
down
for
the
benefit
of
posterity
the
treasures
of
wisdom
which
he
had
stored
up
in
his
long
career
the
nomarch
phtahhotpû
says
my
lord
when
age
is
at
that
point
and
decrepitude
has
arrived
debility
comes
and
a
second
infancy
upon
which
misery
falls
heavily
every
day
the
eyes
become
smaller
the
ears
narrower
strength
is
worn
out
while
the
heart
continues
to
beat
the
mouth
is
silent
and
speaks
no
more
the
heart
becomes
darkened
and
no
longer
remembers
yesterday
the
bones
become
painful
everything
which
was
good
becomes
bad
taste
vanishes
entirely
old
age
renders
a
man
miserable
in
every
respect
for
his
nostrils
close
up
and
he
breathes
no
longer
whether
he
rises
up
or
sits
down
if
the
humble
servant
who
is
in
thy
presence
receives
an
order
to
enter
on
a
discourse
befitting
an
old
man
then
i
will
tell
to
thee
the
language
of
those
who
know
the
history
of
the
past
of
those
who
have
heard
the
gods
for
if
thou
conductest
thyself
like
them
discontent
shall
disappear
from
among
men
and
the
two
lands
shall
work
for
thee
the
majesty
of
this
god
says
me
in
the
language
of
old
times
for
it
will
work
a
wonder
for
the
children
of
the
nobles
whosoever
enters
and
understands
it
his
heart
weighs
carefully
what
it
says
and
it
does
not
produce
we
must
not
expect
to
find
in
this
work
any
great
profundity
of
thought
clever
analyses
subtle
discussions
metaphysical
abstractions
were
not
in
fashion
in
the
time
of
phtahhotpû
actual
facts
were
preferred
to
speculative
fancies
man
himself
was
the
subject
of
observation
his
passions
his
habits
his
temptations
and
his
defects
not
for
the
purpose
of
constructing
a
system
therefrom
but
in
the
hope
of
reforming
the
imperfections
of
his
nature
and
of
pointing
out
to
him
the
road
to
fortune
phtahhotpû
therefore
does
not
show
much
invention
or
make
deductions
he
writes
down
his
reflections
just
as
they
occur
to
him
without
formulating
them
or
drawing
any
conclusion
from
them
as
a
whole
knowledge
is
indispensable
to
getting
on
in
the
world
hence
he
recommends
knowledge
gentleness
to
subordinates
is
politic
and
shows
good
education
hence
he
praises
gentleness
he
mingles
advice
throughout
on
the
behaviour
to
be
observed
in
the
various
circumstances
of
life
on
being
introduced
into
the
presence
of
a
haughty
and
choleric
man
on
entering
society
on
the
occasion
of
dining
with
a
dignitary
on
being
married
thou
art
wise
thou
wilt
go
up
into
thine
house
and
love
thy
wife
at
home
thou
wilt
give
her
abundance
of
food
thou
wilt
clothe
her
back
with
garments
all
that
covers
her
limbs
her
perfumes
is
the
joy
of
her
life
as
long
as
thou
lookest
to
this
she
is
as
a
profitable
field
to
her
to
analyse
such
a
work
in
detail
is
impossible
it
is
still
more
impossible
to
translate
the
whole
of
it
the
nature
of
the
subject
the
strangeness
of
certain
precepts
the
character
of
the
style
all
tend
to
disconcert
the
reader
and
to
mislead
him
in
his
interpretations
from
the
very
earliest
times
ethics
has
been
considered
as
a
healthy
and
praiseworthy
subject
in
itself
but
so
hackneyed
was
it
that
a
change
in
the
mode
of
expressing
it
could
alone
give
it
freshness
phtahhotpû
is
a
victim
to
the
exigencies
of
the
style
he
adopted
others
before
him
had
given
utterance
to
the
truths
he
wished
to
convey
he
was
obliged
to
clothe
them
in
a
startling
and
interesting
form
to
arrest
the
attention
of
his
readers
in
some
places
he
has
expressed
his
thought
with
such
subtlety
that
the
meaning
is
lost
in
the
jingle
of
the
words
the
art
of
the
memphite
dynasties
has
suffered
as
much
as
the
literature
from
the
hand
of
time
but
in
the
case
of
the
former
the
fragments
are
at
least
numerous
and
accessible
to
all
the
kings
of
this
period
erected
temples
in
their
cities
and
not
to
speak
of
the
chapel
of
the
sphinx
we
find
in
the
remains
still
existing
of
these
buildings
chambers
of
granite
alabaster
and
limestone
covered
with
religious
scenes
like
those
of
more
recent
periods
although
in
some
cases
the
walls
are
left
bare
their
public
buildings
have
all
or
nearly
all
perished
breaches
have
been
made
in
them
by
invading
armies
or
by
civil
wars
and
they
have
been
altered
enlarged
and
restored
scores
of
times
in
the
course
of
ages
but
the
tombs
of
the
old
kings
remain
and
afford
proof
of
the
skill
and
perseverance
exhibited
by
the
architects
in
devising
and
carrying
out
their
plans
many
of
the
mastabas
occurring
at
intervals
between
gîzeh
and
mêdûm
have
indeed
been
hastily
and
carelessly
built
as
if
by
those
who
were
anxious
to
get
them
finished
or
who
had
an
eye
to
economy
we
may
observe
in
all
of
them
neglect
and
imperfection
all
the
which
an
unscrupulous
then
as
now
could
be
guilty
of
in
order
to
keep
down
the
net
cost
and
satisfy
the
natural
parsimony
of
his
patrons
without
lessening
his
own
profits
where
however
the
has
not
been
hampered
by
being
forced
to
work
hastily
or
cheaply
he
displays
his
conscientiousness
and
the
choice
of
materials
the
regularity
of
the
courses
and
the
homogeneousness
of
the
building
leave
nothing
to
be
desired
the
blocks
are
adjusted
with
such
precision
that
the
joints
are
almost
invisible
and
the
mortar
between
them
has
been
spread
with
such
a
skilful
hand
that
there
is
scarcely
an
appreciable
difference
in
its
uniform
thickness
the
similarity
of
the
materials
and
technicalities
of
construction
and
decoration
seem
to
me
to
prove
that
the
majority
of
the
tombs
were
built
by
a
small
number
of
contractors
or
corporations
lay
or
ecclesiastical
both
at
memphis
under
the
ancient
as
well
as
at
thebes
under
the
new
empire
speaking
of
the
great
pyramid
and
of
its
casing
professor
petrie
says
the
stones
were
brought
as
close
as
inch
or
in
fact
into
contact
and
the
mean
opening
of
the
joint
was
but
inch
yet
the
builders
managed
to
fill
the
joint
with
cement
despite
the
great
area
of
it
and
the
weight
of
the
stone
to
be
moved
some
tons
to
merely
place
such
stones
in
exact
contact
at
the
sides
would
be
careful
work
but
to
do
so
with
cement
in
the
joint
seems
almost
the
long
low
flat
mass
which
the
finished
tomb
presented
to
the
eye
is
wanting
in
grace
but
it
has
the
characteristics
of
strength
and
indestructibility
well
suited
to
an
the
façade
however
was
not
wanting
in
a
certain
graceful
severity
the
play
of
light
and
shade
distributed
over
its
surface
by
the
stelæ
niches
and
doorways
varied
its
aspect
in
the
course
of
the
day
without
lessening
the
impression
of
its
majesty
and
serenity
which
nothing
could
disturb
the
pyramids
themselves
are
not
as
we
might
imagine
the
coarse
and
reproduction
of
a
mathematical
figure
disproportionately
enlarged
the
architect
who
made
an
estimate
for
that
of
kheops
must
have
carefully
thought
out
the
relative
value
of
the
elements
contained
in
the
problem
which
had
to
be
solved
the
vertical
height
of
the
summit
the
length
of
the
sides
on
the
ground
line
the
angle
of
pitch
the
inclination
of
the
lateral
faces
to
one
another
before
he
discovered
the
exact
proportions
and
the
arrangement
of
lines
which
render
his
monument
a
true
work
of
art
and
not
merely
a
costly
and
mechanical
arrangement
of
stones

which
the
author
an
architect
by

as
well
as

egyptologist
interprets
the
theories

problems
of

mathematical
in
a
new
manner
comparing
the
result
with
his
own
calculations
made
from
measurements
of

shows
by
an
examination
of
the
diagrams
discovered
on
the
wall
of
a
mastaba
at

their
ordinary

the

were
no
better
off
than
themselves
they
were
looked
upon
as
mechanics
of
the
same
social
status
as
the
neighbouring
shoemaker

carpenter
the
majority
of
them
were
in
fact
clever
mechanical
workers
of
varying
capability
accustomed
to
chisel
out
a
or
set
a
statue
firmly
on
its
legs
in
accordance
with
invariable
rules
which
they
transmitted
unaltered
from
one
generation
to
another
some
were
found
among
them
however
who
displayed
unmistakable
genius
in
their
art
and
who
rising
above
the
general
mediocrity
produced
masterpieces
their
equipment
of
tools
was
very
simple
iron
picks
with
wooden
handles
mallets

wood
small
hammers

a
bow

delicate

they

good
advantage
egyptian

left
us
nothing
which
in
purity
of
hue

delicacy
of
modelling
surpasses
the
panels
of
the
tomb

their
seated

standing
male
figures

their

hieroglyphs

egypt

however
but
few

and
even
those
which
were
fitted
for
this
use
were
too
small
and
stunted
to
furnish

of
any
considerable
size

therefore
turned
by
preference
to

to
compass

exactly
resembling
these

are
often
found
in
the

the

dynasties
which
according
to
this
reckoning
would
be
still
older
than
that

they
were
productions
of
an
inferior
studio

their
supposed
archaism
is
merely
the
want

of
an
ignorant
sculptor
the

of

glaring
faults

by

constitute
an
array

honest
folk
without
much
individuality
of

and
no
originality
they
may
be
easily
divided
into
five
or
six
groups
each
having
a
style
in
common
and
all
apparently
having
been
executed
on
the
lines
of
a
few
chosen
models
the
sculptors
who
worked
for
the
mastaba
contractors
were
distributed
among
a
very
few
studios
in
which
a
traditional
routine
was
observed
for
centuries
they
did
not
always
wait
for
orders

like
our
modern
kept
by
them

tolerable
assortment
of
statues
from
which
the
purchaser
could
choose
according
to
his
taste
the
hands
feet
and
bust
lacked
only
the
colouring
and
final
polish
but
the
head
was
merely
and
there
were
no
indications
of
dress
when
the
future
occupant
of
the
tomb
or
his
family
had
made
their
choice
a
few
hours
of
work
were
sufficient
to
transform
the
rough
sketch
into
a
portrait
such
as
it
was
of
the
deceased
they
desired
to
commemorate
and
to
arrange
his
garment
according
to
the
latest
fashion
if
however
the
relatives
or
the
declined
to
be
satisfied
with
these
commonplace
images
and
demanded
a
less
conventional
treatment
of
body
for
the
double
of
him
whom
they
had
lost
there
were
always
some
among
the
assistants
to
be
found
capable
of
entering
into
their
wishes
and
of
seizing
the
lifelike
expression
of
limbs
and
features
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
statues
were
often
like
the
tomb
itself
given
by
the
king

the

is
in
the
gîzeh
vth
dynasty
the
groups
are
repeated
in
one
tomb
after
another
they
are
always
the
same
but
sometimes
they
are
reduced
to
two
or
three
individuals
sometimes
increased
in
number
spread
out
and
crowded
with
figures
and
inscriptions
each
chief
draughtsman
had
his
book
of
subjects
and
texts
which
he
combined
in
various
ways
at
one
time
bringing
them
close
together
at
another
duplicating
or
extending
them
according
to
the
means
put
at
his
disposal
or
the
space
he
had
to
cover
the
same
men
the
same
animals
the
same
features
of
the
landscape
the
same
accessories
appear
everywhere
it
is
industrial
and
mechanical
art
at
its
highest
the
whole
is
however
harmonious
agreeable
to
the
eye
and
instructive
the
conventionalisms
of
the
drawing
as
well
as
those
of
the
composition
are
very
different
from
ours
whether
it
is
man
or
beast
the
subject
is
invariably
presented
in
outline
by
the
brush
or
by
the
graving
tool
in
sharp
relief
upon
the
background
but
the
animals
are
represented
in
action
with
their
usual
gait
movement
and
play
of
limbs
distinguishing
each
species
the
slow
and
measured
walk
of
the
ox
the
short
step
meditative
ears
and
ironical
mouth
of
the
ass
the
calm
strength
of
the
lion
at
rest
the
grimaces
of
the
monkeys
the
slender
gracefulness
of
the
gazelle
and
antelope
are
invariably
presented
with
a
consummate
skill
in
drawing
and
expression
the
human
figure
is
the
least
perfect
every
one
is
acquainted
with
those
strange
figures
whose
heads
in
profile
with
the
eye
drawn
in
full
face
are
attached
to
a
torso
seen
from
the
front
and
supported
by
limbs
in
profile
these
are
truly
anatomical
monsters
and
yet
the
appearance
they
present
to
us
is
neither
laughable
nor
grotesque
the
defective
limbs
are
so
deftly
connected
with
those
which
are
normal
that
the
whole
becomes
natural
the
correct
and
fictitious
lines
are
so
ingeniously
blent
together
that
they
seem
to
rise
necessarily
from
each
other
the
actors
in
these
dramas
are
constructed
in
such
a
paradoxical
fashion
that
they
could
not
exist
in
this
world
of
ours
they
live
notwithstanding
in
spite
of
the
ordinary
laws
of
physiology
and
to
any
one
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
regard
them
without
prejudice
their
strangeness
will
add
a
charm
which
is
lacking
in
works
more
conformable
to
nature
a
layer
of
colour
spread
over
the
whole
heightens
and
completes
them
this
colouring
is
never
quite
true
to
nature
nor
yet
entirely
false
it
approaches
reality
as
far
as
possible
but
without
pretending
to
copy
it
in
a
servile
way
the
water
is
always
a
uniform
blue
or
broken
up
by
black
zigzag
lines
the
skin
of
the
men
is
invariably
brown

taught
in
the
workshops
and
once
the
receipt
for
it
was
drawn
up
it
was
never
varied
in
application
the
effect
produced
by
these
conventional
colours
however
was
neither
discordant
nor
jarring
the
most
brilliant
colours
were
placed
alongside
each
other
with
extreme
audacity
but
with
a
perfect
knowledge
of
their
mutual
relations
and
combined
effect
they
do
not
jar
with
or
exaggerate
or
kill
each
other
they
enhance
each
value
and
by
their
contact
give
rise
to
which

with
them
the
sepulchral
chapels
in
cases
where
their
decoration
had
been
completed
and
where
they
have
reached
us
intact
appear
to
us
as
chambers
hung
with
beautifully
luminous
and
interesting
tapestry
in
which
rest
ought
to
be
pleasant
during
the
heat
of
the
day
to
the
soul
which
dwells
within
them
and
to
the
friends
who
come
there
to
hold
intercourse
with
the
dead
the
decoration
of
palaces
and
houses
was
not
less
sumptuous
than
that
of
the
sepulchres
but
it
has
been
so
completely
destroyed
that
we
should
find
it
difficult
to
form
an
idea
of
the
furniture
of
the
living
if
we
did
not
see
it
frequently
depicted
in
the

enamelled

necklaces

and
ornaments
on
the
walls
even
the
common
pottery
of
which
we
find
the
remains
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
pyramids
are
generally
distinguished
by
an
elegance
and
grace
reflecting
credit
on
the
workmanship
and
taste
of
the
makers

they
applied

the
study
of
the
alabaster

near

furnished

very
ingenious
views
on

egyptians

not
that
they

because
the

fix
the
date
of
their
manufacture
they
came
from

the

unfortunately
no

a

for

was
common
at

among
the
upper
classes
including
not

those
about
the
court
but
also
those
in
the
most
distant

of

the
provincial
lords
like
the
courtiers
of
the

took
a
pride
in
collecting
around

in
the
other

everything
of
the
finest
that
the
art
of
the
architect
sculptor
and
painter
could
conceive
and
execute
their
mansions
as
well
as
their
temples
have
disappeared
but
we
find
here
and
there
on
the
sides
of
the
hills
the
sepulchres
which
they
had
prepared
for
themselves
in
rivalry
with
those
of
the
courtiers
or
the
members
of
the
reigning
family
they
turned
the
valley
into
a
vast
series
of
catacombs
so
that
wherever
we
look
the
horizon
is
bounded
by
a
row
of
historic
tombs

of
that
feudal
government
which
preceded
the
royal
sovereignty
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
of
which
royalty
was
never
able
to
entirely
disembarrass
itself
the
pharaohs
of
the
ivth
dynasty
had
kept
them
in
such
check
that
we
can
hardly
find
any
indications
during
their
reigns
of
the
existence
of
these
great
barons
the
heads
of
the
pharaonic
administration
were
not
recruited
from
among
the
latter
but
from
the
family
and
domestic
circle
of
the
sovereign
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
kings
of
the
vth
dynasty
it
would
appear
that
the
barons
again
entered
into
favour
and
gradually
gained
the
upper
hand
we

the
position

explain

agree
with

that
a
faithful
subject
should
declare
the
favours
of
his
sovereign
to
be
something
new
and
unprecedented
even
when
they
presented
nothing
extraordinary
or
out
of
the
common
gifts
of
sepulchral
furniture
were
of
frequent
occurrence
and
we
know
of
more
than
one
instance
of
them
previous
to
the
vith
dynasty
for
example
the
case
of
the
physician
whose
tomb
still
exists
at
saqqâra
and
whom
pharaoh
sahurî
rewarded
by
presenting
him
with
a
monumental
stele
in
stone
from
turah
henceforth
uni
could
face
without
apprehension
the
future
which
awaited
him
in
the
other
world
at
the
same
time
he
continued
to
make
his
way
no
less
quickly
in
this
and
was
soon
afterwards
promoted
to
the
rank
of
and
superintendent
of
the
irrigated
lands
of
the
king
the
were
closely
attached
to
the
person
of
their
master
in
all
ceremonies
their
appointed
place
was
immediately
behind
him
a
place
of
the
highest
honour
and
trust
for
those
who
occupied
it
literally
held
his
life
in
their
hands
they
made
all
the
arrangements
for
his
processions
and
journeys
and
saw
that
the
proper
ceremonial
was
everywhere
observed
and
that
no
accident
was
allowed
to
interrupt
the
progress
of
his
train
lastly
they
had
to
take
care
that
none
of
the
nobles
ever
departed
from
the
precise
position
to
which
his
birth
or
office
entitled
him
this
was
a
task
which
required
a
great
deal
of
tact
for
questions
of
precedence
gave
rise
to
nearly
as
many
in
egypt
as
in
modern
courts
uni
acquitted
himself
so
dexterously
that
he
was
called
upon
to
act
in
a
still
more
delicate
capacity
queen
amîtsi
was
the
chief
consort
whether
she
had
dabbled
in
some
intrigue
of
the
palace
or
had
been
guilty
of
unfaithfulness
in
act
or
in
intention
or
had
been
mixed
up
in
one
of
those
feminine
dramas
which
so
frequently
disturb
the
peace
of
harems
we
do
not
know
at
any
rate
papi
considered
it
necessary
to
proceed
against
her
and
appointed
uni
to
judge
the
case
aided
only
by
his
secretary
he
drew
up
the
indictment
and
decided
the
action
so
discreetly
that
to
this
day
we
do
not
know
of
what
crime
amîtsi
was
accused
or
how
the
matter
ended
uni
felt
great
pride
at
having
been
preferred
before
all
others
for
this
affair
and
not
without
reason
says
he
duties
were
to
superintend
the
royal
forests
and
never
before
me
had
a
man
in
my
position
been
initiated
into
the
secrets
of
the
royal
harem
but
his
majesty
initiated
me
into
them
because
my
wisdom
pleased
his
majesty
more
than
that
of
any
other
of
his
lieges
more
than
that
of
any
other
of
his
mamelukes
more
than
that
of
any
other
of
his
these
antecedents
did
not
seem
calculated
to
mark
out
uni
as
a
future
minister
of
war
but
in
the
east
when
a
man
has
given
proofs
of
his
ability
in
one
branch
of
administration
there
is
a
tendency
to
consider
him
equally
well
fitted
for
service
in
any
of
the
others
and
the
fiat
of
a
prince
transforms
the
clever
scribe
of
into
the
general
of
no
one
is
surprised
not
even
the
person
promoted
he
accepts
his
new
duties
without
flinching
and
frequently
distinguishes
himself
as
much
in
their
performance
as
though
he
had
been
bred
to
them
from
his
youth
up
when
papi
had
resolved
to
give
a
lesson
to
the
bedouin
of
sinai
he
at
once
thought
of
uni
his
friend
who
had
so
skilfully
conducted
the
case
of
queen
amîtsi
the
expedition
was
not
one
of
those
which
could
be
brought
to
a
successful
issue
by
the
troops
of
the
frontier
nomes
it
required
a
considerable
force
and
the
whole
military
organization
of
the
country
had
to
be
brought
into
play
majesty
raised
troops
to
the
number
of
several
myriads
in
the
whole
of
the
south
from
elephantine
to
the
nome
of
the
haunch
in
the
delta
in
the
two
halves
of
the

and
his
majesty
sent
me
at
the
head
of
this
army
it
is
true
there
were
chiefs
there
there
were
mamelukes
of
the
king
there
there
were
sole
friends
of
the
great
house
there
there
were
princes
and
governors
of
castles
from
the
south
and
from
the
north
friends
directors
of
the
prophets
from
the
south
and
the
north
directors
of
districts
at
the
head
of
troops
from
the
south
and
the
north
of
castles
and
towns
that
each
one
ruled
and
also
blacks
from
the
regions
which
i
have
mentioned
but
it
was
i
who
gave
them
their
orders
although
my
post
was
only
that
of
superintendent
of
the
irrigated
lands
of
pharaoh
so
much
so
that
every
one
of
them
obeyed
me
like
the
it
was
not
without
much
difficulty
that
he
brought
this
motley
crowd
into
order
equipped
them
and
supplied
them
with
rations
at
length
he
succeeded
in
arranging
everything
satisfactorily
by
dint
of
patience
and
perseverance
one
took
his
biscuit
and
sandals
for
the
march
and
each
one
of
them
took
bread
from
the
towns
and
each
one
of
them
took
goats
from
the
he
collected
his
forces
on
the
frontier
of
the
delta
in
the
of
the
north
between
the
of
and
the
of
horû
and
set
out
into
the
desert
he
advanced
probably
by
gebel
magharah
and
gebel
helal
as
far
as
into
the
rich
and
populous
country
which
lay
between
the
southern
slopes
of
gebel
tîh
and
the
south
of
the
dead
sea
once
there
he
acted
with
all
the
rigour
permitted
by
the
articles
of
war
and
paid
back
with
interest
the
ill
usage
which
the
bedouin
had
inflicted
on
egypt
army
came
in

it
completely
destroyed
the
country
of

this

of
all
their

this

their
troops
to
the
numbers
of
many
myriads
this
army
came
in

it
brought
back
great
numbers
of
their
people
as
living
captives
for
which
thing
his
majesty
praised
me
more
than
for
aught
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
poor
wretches
were
sent
off
as
soon
as
taken
to
the
quarries
or
to
the
dockyards
thus
relieving
the
king
from
the
necessity
of
imposing
compulsory
labour
too
frequently
on
his
egyptian
subjects
the
locality
of
the
tribes
against
which
uni
waged
war
can
i
think
be
fixed
by
certain
details
of
the
campaign
especially
the
mention
of
the
oval
or
circular
enclosures
within
which
they
entrenched
themselves
these
enclosures
or
ndars
correspond
to
the
nadami
which
are
mentioned
by
travellers
in
these
regions
and
which
are
singularly
characteristic
the
of
the
mentioned
by
uni
occupied
the
naûami
country
the
negeb
regions
situated
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
of
tih
round
about
and
beyond
it
as
far
as
akabah
and
the
dead
sea
assuming
this
hypothesis
to
be
correct
the
route
followed
by
uni
must
have
been
the
same
as
that
which
was
discovered
and
described
nearly
twenty
years
ago
by
holland
majesty
sent
me
five
times
to
lead
this
army
in
order
to
penetrate
into
the
country
of
the
lords
of
the
sands
on
each
occasion
of
their
revolt
against
this
army
and
i
bore
myself
so
well
that
his
majesty
praised
me
beyond
the
bedouin
at
length
submitted
but
the
neighbouring
tribes
to
the
north
of
them
who
had
no
doubt
assisted
them
threatened
to
dispute
with
egypt
the
possession
of
the
territory
which
it
had
just
conquered
as
these
tribes
had
a
seaboard
on
the
mediterranean
uni
decided
to
attack
them
by
sea
and
got
together
a
fleet
in
which
he
embarked
his
army
the
troops
landed
on
the
coast
of
the
district
of
tiba
to
the
north
of
the
country
of
the
lords
of
the
sands
thereupon
set
out
i
went
i
smote
all
the
barbarians
and
i
killed
all
those
of
them
who
on
his
return
uni
obtained
the
most
distinguished
marks
of
favour
that
a
subject
could
receive
the
right
to
carry
a
staff
and
to
wear
his
sandals
in
the
palace
in
the
presence
of
pharaoh
these
wars
had
occupied
the
latter
part
of
the
reign
the
last
of
them
took
place
very
shortly
before
the
death
of
the
sovereign
the
domestic
administration
of
papi
seems
to
have
been
as
successful
in
its
results
as
was
his
activity
abroad
he
successfully
worked
the
mines
of
sinai
caused
them
to
be
regularly
inspected
and
obtained
an
unusual
quantity
of
minerals
from
them
the
expedition
he
sent
thither
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
reign
left
behind
it
a
in
which
are
recorded
the
victories
of
uni
over
the
barbarians
and
the
grants
of

dendera
was
falling
into
ruins
it
was
restored
on
the
lines
i
of
the
original
plans
which
were
accidentally
discovered
and
this
piety
displayed
towards
one
of
the
most
honoured
deities
was
rewarded
as
it
deserved
to
be
by
the
insertion
of
the
title
of
of
in
the
royal
cartouche
the
vassals
rivalled
their
sovereign
in
activity
and
built
new
towns
on
all
sides
to
serve
them
as
residences
more
than
one
of
which
was
named
after
the
pharaoh
the
death
of

did
nothing
to
interrupt
this
movement

sons

metesouphis
was
almost
a
child
when
he
ascended
the
throne
the
recently
conquered
bedouin
gave
him
no
trouble
the
memory
of
their
reverses
was
still
too
recent
to
encourage
them
to
take
advantage
of
his
minority
and
renew
hostilities
uni
moreover
was
at

ready
to
recommence
his
campaigns
at
the
slightest
provocation
metesouphis
had
retained
him
in
all
his
offices
and
had
even
entrusted
him
with
new
duties
appointed
me
of
upper
egypt
from
elephantine
in
the
south
to
letopolis
in
the
north
because
my
wisdom
was
pleasing
to
his
majesty
because
my
zeal
was
pleasing
to
his
majesty
because
the
heart
of
his
majesty
was
satisfied
with
me
when
i
was
in
my
place
i
was
above
all
his
vassals
all
his
mamelukes
and
all
his
servants
for
never
had
so
great
a
dignity
been
previously
conferred
upon
a
mere
subject
i
fulfilled
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
king
my
office
as
superintendent
of
the
south
so
satisfactorily
that
it
was
granted
to
me
to
be
second
in
rank
to
him
accomplishing
all
the
duties
of
a
superintendent
of
works
judging
all
the
cases
which
the
royal
administration
had
to

judgment
at
all
hours
determined
by
the

its
cover

have
been
within
sixty
years
of
this
date
i
believe
to
be
at

four
centuries
too
late

is
perhaps
to

not

of

enterprise

not

yet

fleet
in
nubia

even
if
they
had
had
the
condition
of
the

was
such
as
to
prevent
it
from
making

he
shared
with

he
was
at
the

of
many

chosen
from
among
the

which
was
the
cause
of
his
success
in
the
enterprise
with
which
his
holiness
had
deigned
to
entrust
him
once
however
the
king
employed
him
in
regions
which
were
not
so
familiar
to
him
as
those
of
nubia
and
fate
was
against
him
he
had
received
orders
to
visit
the

the
asiatic
tribes
inhabiting
the
sinaitic
peninsula
and
to
repeat
on
a
smaller

in

the
expedition
which
uni
had
led
against
them
in

north
he
proceeded
thither
and
his
sojourn
having
come
to
an
end
he
chose
to
return
by

to
sail
towards

up
as
far
as
the

to

presented
no

doubtless
more

accomplished
it
papinakhîti

brought
home
his
body
which
was
buried
by
the
side
of
the
other
princes
in
the
mountain
opposite

papi
ii
had
ample
leisure
to
avenge
the
death
of
his
vassal
and
to
send
fresh
expeditions
to
iritît
among
the
amamît
and
even
beyond
if
indeed
as
the
author
of
the
chronological
canon
of
turin
asserts
he
really
reigned
for
more
than
ninety
years
but
the
monuments
are
almost
silent
with
regard
to
him
and
give
us
no
information
about
his
possible
exploits
in
nubia
an
inscription
of
his
second
year
proves
that
he
continued
to
work
the
sinaitic
mines
and
that
he
protected
them
from
the
bedouin
the
fragments
of
manetho
and
the
canon
of
eratosthenes
agree
in
assigning
to
him
a
reign
of
a
hundred
years
a
fact
which
seems
to
indicate
that
the
missing
unit
in
the
turin
list
was
nine
papi
ii
would
have
thus
died
in
the
hundreth
year
of
his
reign
a
reign
of
a
hundred
years
is
impossible
mihtimsaûf
having
reigned
fourteen
years
it
would
be
necessary
to
assume
that
papi
son
of
papi
should
have
lived
a
hundred
and
fourteen
years
at
the
least
even
on
the
supposition
that
he
was
a
posthumous
child
the
simplest
solution
is
to
suppose
that
papi
ii
lived
a
hundred
years
as
ramses
ii
did
in
later
times
and
that
the
years
of
his
life
were
confounded
with
the
years
of
his
reign
or
that
being
the
brother
of
mihtimsaûf
he
was
considered
as
associated
with
him
on
the
throne
and
that
the
hundred
years
of
his
reign
including
the
fourteen
of
the
latter
prince
were
identified
with
the
years
of
his
life
we
may
moreover
believe
that
the
chronologists
for
lack
of
information
on
the
vith
dynasty
have
filled
the
blanks
in
their
annals
by
lengthening
the
reign
of
papi
which
in
any
case
must
have
been
very
long
on
the
other
hand
the
number
and
beauty
of
the
tombs
in
which
mention
is
made
of
him
bear
witness
to
the
fact
that
egypt
enjoyed
continued
prosperity
recent
discoveries
have
done
much
to
surround
this
king

his

says
that
nitokris
wished
to
avenge
the

was

his

to

as
was

she
built
an
immense
subterranean
hall
under
pretext
of
inaugurating
its
completion
but
in
reality
with
a
totally
different
aim
she
then
invited
to
a
great
feast
and
received
in
this
hall
a
considerable
number
of
egyptians
from
among
those
whom
she
knew
to
have

diverted

queen

threw
herself
into

escape
she
completed
the
pyramid
of

adding
to
it
that
costly
casing
of

which
excited
the
admiration
of

reposed
in

attribute

for
the
name
of

substituted
the
more
harmonious
one
of
rhodopis

was
the
exact
translation
of
the
characteristic
epithet
of
the
egyptian
queen
one
day

she
was
bathing
in

an
eagle
stole
one
of

it
off

let
it
drop
in
the
lap
of

was
administering
justice

the
king
astonished
at
the
singular
occurrence
and
at
the
beauty
of
the
tiny
shoe
caused
a
search
to
be
made
throughout
the
country

the
woman
to
whom
it
belonged

thus
became
queen
of

the
spirit
of

never
appears
abroad

in
the
form
of
a
naked
woman

very
beautiful

whose
manner

acting
is
such
that
when
she
desires
to
make
people
fall
in
love
with
her
and
lose
their
wits
she
smiles
upon
them
and
immediately
they
draw
near
to
her
and
she
attracts
them
towards
her
and
makes
them
infatuated
with
love
so
that
they
at
once
lose
their
wits
and
wander
aimlessly
about
the
country
many
have
seen
her
moving

which
they
sank

they
reduced

the
absence

their
occupation
this
hypothesis
however
is
unsupported
by
any
direct
proof
even
the
dearth
of

which
has
been

as
an
argument
in
favour
of
the
theory
is
no
longer
a
fact
the
sequence
of
reigns
and
details
of
the
revolutions
are
wanting
but
many
of
the
kings
and
certain
facts
in
their
history
are
known
and
we
are
able
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
general
course
of
events
the
viith
and
viiith
dynasties
are
memphite
and
the
names
of
the
kings
themselves
would
be
evidence
in
favour
of
their
genuineness
even
if
we
had
not
the
direct
testimony
of
manetho
the
one
recurring
most
frequently
is
that
of

the
little
recorded
of
them
in

times
even
the
legend
of
the
seventy
pharaohs
reigning
seventy
days
betrays
a
troublous
period
and
a
rapid
change
of

the
explanation

the

in

the

comprised
the
territory
lying
between
the
nile

the

from
the
two
villages
to
the
harabshent
canal
a
district
known
to
greek
geographers
as
the
island

it
moreover
included
the
whole
basin
of
the

and
these
divisions
united
usually
under
the
supremacy
of
one
chief
formed
a
kind
of
small
state
of
which
heracleopolis
was
always
the
capital
the
soil
was
fertile
well
watered
and
well
tilled
but
the
revenues
from
this
district
confined
between
the
two
arms
of
the

were
small
in
comparison
with
the
wealth
which
their
ruler
derived
from
his
hands

by
a
narrow

six

into
an
immense

of

appears
to
be
one
confused
struggle
from

to

war
raged
without
intermission
the
pharaohs
fought
against
their
rebel
vassals
the
nobles
fought
among
themselves
and
what
scarcely
amounted
to
warfare
there
were
the
raids
on
all
sides
of
pillaging
bands
who
although
too
feeble
to
constitute
any
serious
danger
to
large
cities
were
strong
enough
either
in
numbers
or
discipline
to
render
the
country

fortresses
were
established

concave
somewhat
resembling
a
wide

arch
whose
outer
curve
rests
on
the
ground
in
other
places
there
was
a
regular
alternation
of
lengths
of
curved
courses
with
those
in
which
the
courses
were
strictly
horizontal
the
object
of
this
method
of
structure
is
still
unknown

it
is
thought
that
such
building
offers
better
resistance

one
of
the
specimens

architecture
dating

times

my
first
opinion
was
that
the
second
fortress
had
been
built
towards
the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
at
the
earliest
perhaps
even
under
the
xxth
further
consideration
of
the
details
of
its
construction
and
decoration
now
leads
me
to
attribute
it
to
the
period
between
the
vith
and

dynasties

the

with
a

at

diversify

it

feet
in

the
walk
round
the
ramparts
was
crowned
by
a
slight
low
parapet
with
rounded
battlements
and
was
reached
by
narrow
staircases
carefully
constructed
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
a
battlemented
covering
wall
about
five
and
a
half
yards
high
encircled
the
building
at
a
distance
of
some
four
feet
the
fortress
itself
was
entered
by
two
gates
and
posterns
placed
at
various
points
between
them
provided
for
sorties
of
the
garrison
the
principal
entrance
was
concealed
in
a
thick
block
of

the

entrance
in

was
a
narrow

closed

massive

a

was
a

as

leading
into
an
oblong
court
hemmed
in
between
the
outer
rampart
and
two
bastions
projecting
at
right
angles
from
it
and
lastly
there
was
a
gate
purposely
placed
at
the
furthest

obvious
corner
of
the
court
such
a
fortress
was
strong
enough
to
resist
any
modes
of
attack
then
at
the
disposal
of
the
armies
which
knew
but
three
ways
of
taking
a
place
by
force
viz
scaling
sapping
and
breaking
open
the
gates
the
height
of
the
walls
effectually
prevented
scaling
the
pioneers
were
kept
at
a
distance
by
the
brave
but
if
a
breach
were
made
in
that
the
small
flanking
galleries
fixed
outside
the
battlements
enabled
the
besieged
to
overwhelm
the
enemy
with
stones
and
javelins
as
they
approached
and
to
make
the
work
of
sapping
almost
impossible
should
the
first
gate
of
the
fortress
yield
to
the
assault
the
attacking
party
would
be
crowded
together
in
the
courtyard
as
in
a
pit
few
being
able
to
enter
together
they
would
at
once
be
constrained
to
attack
the
second
gate
under
a
shower
of
missiles
and
did
they
succeed
in
carrying
that
also
it
was
at
the
cost
of
enormous
sacrifice

dressed
stone
surmounted
by
a
pointed
roof
in
the
shape
of
a
pyramid
others
were
true
pyramids
sometimes
having
a
pair
of
obelisks
in
front
of
them
as
well
as
a
temple
none
of
them
attained
to
the
dimensions
of
the
memphite
tombs
for
with
only
its
own
resources
at
command
the
kingdom
of
the
south
could
not
build
monuments
to
compete
with
those
whose
construction
had
taxed
the
united
efforts
of
all
egypt
but
it
used
a
crude
black
brick
made
without
grit
or
straw
where
the
egyptians
of
the
north
had
preferred
more
costly
stone
these
inexpensive
pyramids
were
built
on
a
rectangular
base
not
more
than
six
and
a
half
feet
high
and
the
whole
erection
which
was
simply
faced
with
whitewashed
stucco
never
exceeded
feet
in
height
the
sepulchral
chamber
was
generally
in
the
centre
in
shape
it
resembled
an
oven
its
roof
being
by
the
overlapping
of
the
courses
often
also
it
was
constructed
partly
in
the
base
and
partly
in
the
foundations
below
the
base
the
empty
space
above
it
being
intended
merely
to
lighten
the
weight
of
the
masonry
there
was
not
always
an
external
chapel
attached
to
these
tombs
but
a
stele
placed
on
the
substructure
or
fixed
in
one
of
the
outer
faces
marked
the
spot
to
which
offerings
were
to
be
brought
for
the
dead
sometimes
however
there
was
the
addition
of
a
square
vestibule
in
front
of
the
tomb
and
here
on
prescribed
days
the
memorial
ceremonies
took
place
the
statues
of
the
double
were
rude
and
clumsy
the
coffins
heavy
and
massive
and
the
figures
with
which
they
were
decorated
inelegant
and
out
of
proportion
while
the
stelæ
are
very
rudely
cut
from
the
time
of
the
vith
dynasty
the
lords
of
the
saïd
had
been
reduced
to
employing
workmen
from
memphis
to
adorn
their
monuments
but
the
rivalry
between
the
thebans
and
the
heracleopolitans
which
set
the
two
divisions
of
egypt
against
each
other
in
constant
hostility
obliged
the
antufs
to
entrust
the
execution
of
their
orders
to
the
local
schools
of
sculptors
and
painters
it
is
difficult
to
realize
the
degree
of
rudeness
to
which
the
unskilled
workmen
who
made
certain
of
the
akhmîtn
and
gebelên
sarcophagi
must
have
sunk
and
even
at
thebes
itself
or
at
abydos
the
execution
of
both
and
hieroglyphs
shows
minute
carefulness
rather
than
any
real
skill
or
artistic
feeling
failing
to
attain
to
the
beautiful
the
egyptians
endeavoured
to
produce
the
sumptuous
expeditions

the
wady

of

more
and
more
frequent

wells
were
sunk
from
point
to
point
along
the
road
leading
from
koptos
to
the
mountains
sometimes
these
expeditions
were
made
the
occasion
for
pushing
on
as
far
as
the
port
of
saû
and
embarking
on
the

a
hastily
constructed
boat
cruised
along

of

on
the
return
of
the
convoy
with
its
block
of
stone
and
various
packages
of
merchandise
there
was
no
lack
of
scribes
to
recount
the
dangers
of
the
campaign
in
exaggerated
language
or
to
congratulate
the
reigning
pharaoh
on
having
sown
abroad
the
fame
and
terror
of
his
name
in
the
countries
of
the

overthrow
of
the
heracleopolitan
dynasty
and
the
union
of
the
two

house
are
supposed
to
have
been
the
work
of
that
monthotpû

nibkhrôûrî
his
at
any

was
the
name
which
the
egyptians

inscribed

that

most
illustrious

his

he
still

known

about

his
counsel
to
the
prosperity
of
their
common
empire
such
was
the
reputation
for
wisdom
which
he
thus
acquired
that
a
writer
who
was
almost
his
contemporary
composed
a
treatise
in
his
name
and
in
it
the
king
was
supposed
to
address
posthumous
instructions
to
his
son
on
the
art
of
governing
he
appeared
to
his
son
in
a
dream
and
thus
admonished
him
unto
my
words
thou
art
king
over
the
two
worlds
prince
over
the
three
regions
act
still
better
than
did
thy

thee

they
give
themselves
up
to
fear
keep
not
thyself
apart
in
the
midst
of
them
make
not
thy
brother
solely
from
the
rich

fill
not
thy

with
them
alone

neither
do
thou
admit
to
thy

his
counsels
by
examples
taken
from
his
own
life
and
from
these
we
have
learned
some
facts
in
his
history
the
little
work
was
widely
disseminated
and
soon
became
a
classic
in
the
time
of

xixth

it
was
still
copied
in

studied
by

so
accustomed
the
egyptians
to
consider
this

alone
upon

thus
the

to

dread
of

to
have

contented
themselves

amenemhâît

completed
the

of
fortresses
across
the

these
were
carefully
maintained
by
his
successors
the

not

of

direct
sway
over
the
tribes
of

scrupulously
avoided

at

i
had
reached

set
out
for
the
lake
of

then
thirst
fell
upon
me
and
the
was
in
my
throat
my
throat
cleaved
together
and
i
said
is
the
taste
of
death
when
suddenly
i
lifted
up
my
heart
and
gathered
my
strength
together
i
heard
the
lowing
of
the
herds
i
perceived
some
asiatics
their
chief
who
had
been
in
egypt
knew
me
he
gave
me
water
and
caused
milk
to
be
boiled
for
me
and
i
went
with
him
and
joined
his
but
still
sinûhît
did
not
feel
himself
in
safety
and
fled
into
kadûma
to
a
prince
who
had
provided
an
asylum
for
other
egyptian
exiles
and
where
he
hear
men
speak
the

of
here
he
soon
gained
honours
and
fortune
chief
preferred
me
before
his
children
giving
me
his
eldest
daughter
in
marriage
and
he
granted
me
that
i
should
choose
for
myself
the
best
of
his
land
near
the
frontier
of
a
neighbouring
country
it
is
an
excellent
land
aîa
is
its
name
figs
are
there
and
grapes
wine
is
more
plentiful
than
water
honey
abounds
in
it
numerous
are
its
olives
and
all
the
produce
of
its
trees
there
are
corn
and
flour
without
end
and
cattle
of
all
kinds
great
indeed
was
that
which
was
bestowed
upon
me
when
the
prince
came
to
invest
me
installing
me
as
prince
of
a
tribe
in
the
best
of
his
land
i
had
daily
rations
of
bread
and
wine
day
by

cooked
meat
and
roasted
fowl
besides
the
mountain
game
which
i
took
or
which
was
placed
before
me
in

to
that
which
was
brought
me
by
my
hunting
dogs
much
butter
was
made
for
me
and
milk
prepared
in
every
kind
of
way
there
i
passed
many
years
and
the
children
which
were
born
to
me
became
strong
men
each
ruling
his
own
tribe
when
a
messenger
was
going
to
the
interior
or
returning
from
it
he
turned
aside
from
his
way
to
come
to
me
for
i
did
kindness
to
all
i
gave
water
to
the
thirsty
i
set
again
upon

the
traveller
who
had
been
stopped
on

i
chastised
the
brigand
the
pitaîtiû
who
went
on
distant
campaigns
to
fight
and
repel
the
princes
of
foreign
lands
i
commanded
them

marched
forth

me
the

i
set
out

in

by
their
wells
i
seized
their
cattle
i
took
away
their
vassals
and
carried
off
their

i
slew

was
at
the

of
my
sword

my
bow
of
my
marches
of
my
plans

to
the
heart
of
my
prince
thus
when
he
knew
my
valour
he
loved
me
making
me
chief
among
his
children
when
he
saw
the
strength
of
my
arms
valiant
man
of
tonu
came
to
defy
me
in
my
tent
he
was
a
hero
beside
whom
there
was
none
other
for
he
had
overthrown
all
his
adversaries
he
said
sinûhît
fight
with
me
for
he
has
not
yet
conquered
me
and
he
thought
to
seize
my
cattle
and
therewith
to
enrich
his
tribe
the
prince
talked
of
the
matter
with
me
i
said
know
him
not
verily
i
am
not
his
brother
i
keep
myself
far
from
his
dwelling
have
i
ever
opened
his
door
or
crossed
his
enclosures
doubtless
he
is
some
jealous
fellow
envious
at
seeing
me
and
who
believes
himself
fated
to
rob
me
of
my
cats
my
goats
my
kine
and
to
fall
on
my
bulls
my
rams
and
my
oxen
to
take
them
if
he
has
indeed
the
courage
to
fight
let
him
declare
the
intention
of
his
heart
shall
the
god
forget
him
whom
he
has
heretofore
favoured
this
man
who
has
challenged
me
to
fight
is
as
one
of
those
who
lie
upon
the
funeral
couch
i
bent
my
bow
i
took
out
my
arrows
i
loosened
my
poignard
i
furbished
my
arms
at
dawn
all
the
land
of
tonu
ran
forth
its
tribes
were
gathered
together
and
all
the
foreign
lands
which
were
its
dependencies
for
they
were
impatient
to
see
this
duel
each
heart
was
on
live
coals
because
of
me
men
and
women
cried
for
every
heart
was
disquieted
for
my
sake
and
they
said
there
indeed
any
valiant
man
who
will
stand
up
against
him
lo
the
enemy
has
buckler
and
an
armful
of
when
he
had
come
forth
and
i
appeared
i
turned
aside
his
shafts
from
me
when
not
one
of
them
touched
me
he
fell
upon
me
and
then
i
drew
my
bow
against
him
when
my
arrow
pierced
his
neck
he
cried
out
and
fell
to
the
earth
upon
his
nose
i
snatched
his
lance
from
him
i
shouted
my
cry
of
victory
upon
his
back
while
the
country
people
rejoiced
i
made
his
vassals
whom
he
had
oppressed
to
give
thanks
to
montu
this
prince
ammiânshi
bestowed
upon
me
all
the
possessions
of
the
vanquished
and
i
took
away
his
goods
i
carried
off
his
cattle
all
that
he
had
desired
to
do
unto
me
that
did
i
unto
him
i
took
possession
of
all
that
was
in
his
tent
i
despoiled
his
dwelling
therewith
was
the
abundance
of
my
treasure
and
the
number
of
my
cattle
in
later
times

arab
romances
such
as
that
of
antar
or
that
of
we
find
the
incidents
and
customs
described
in
this
egyptian
tale
there
we
have
the
exile
arriving
at
the
court
of
a
great
sheikh
whose
daughter
he
ultimately
marries
the
challenge
the
fight
and
the
raids
of
one
people
against
another
even
in
our
own
day
things
go
on
in
much
the
same
way
seen
from
afar
these
adventures
have
an
air
of
poetry
and
of
grandeur
which
fascinates
the
reader
and
in
imagination
transports
him
into
a
world
more
heroic
and
more
noble
than
our
own
he
who
cares
to
preserve
this
impression
would
do
well
not
to
look
too
closely
at
the
men
and
manners
of
the
desert
certainly
the
hero
is
brave
but
he
is
still
more
brutal
and
treacherous
fighting
is
one
object
of
his
existence
but
pillage
is
a
far
more
important
one
how
indeed
should
it
be
otherwise
the
soil
is
poor
life
hard
and
precarious
and
from
remotest
antiquity
the
conditions
of
that
life
have
remained
unchanged
apart
from
firearms
and
islam
the
bedouin
of
are
the
same
as
the
bedouin
of
the
days
of
sinûhît
there
are
no
known
documents
from
which
we
can
derive
any
certain
information
as
to
what
became
of
the
mining
colonies
in
sinai
after
the
reign
of
papi
ii
unless
entirely
abandoned
they
must
have
lingered
on
in
comparative
idleness
for
the
last
of
the
memphites
the
heracleopohtans
and
the
early
thebans
were
compelled
to
neglect
them
nor
was
their
active
life
resumed
until
the
accession
of
the
xiith
dynasty
the
veins
in
the
wady
maghara
were
much
exhausted
but
a
series
of
fortunate
explorations
revealed
the
existence
of
untouched
deposits
in
the
north
of
the
original
workings
from
the
time
of
amenemhâît
ii
these
new
veins
were
worked
and
absorbed
attention
during
several
generations
expeditions
to
the
mines
were
sent
out
every
three
or
four
years
sometimes
annually
under
the
command
of
such
high
functionaries
as
of
the
king
lectors
and
captains
of
the
archers
as
each
mine
was
rapidly
worked
out
the
delegates
of
the
pharaohs
were
obliged
to
find
new
veins
in
order
to
meet
industrial
demands
the
task
was
often
arduous
and
the
commissioners
generally
took
care
to
inform
posterity
very
fully
as
to
the
anxieties
which
they
had
felt
the
pains
which
they
had
taken
and
the
quantities
of
turquoise
or
of
oxide
of
copper
which
they
had
brought
into
egypt
thus
the
captain
haroëris
tells
us
that
on
arriving
at
sarbût
in
the
month
of
an
unknown
year
of
amenemhâît
he
made
a
bad
beginning
in
his
work
of
exploration
wearied
of
fruitless
efforts
the
workmen
were
quite
ready
to
desert
him
if
he
had
not
put
a
good
face
on
the
business
and
stoutly
promised
them
the
support
of

as
a
matter

did
change
when

began
to
despair
desert
burned
like
summer
the
mountain
was
on
fire
and
the
vein
exhausted
one
morning
the
overseer
who
was
there
questioned
the
miners
the
skilled
workers
who
were
used
to
the
mine
and
they
said
is

for
eternity

the
at
that
very
moment
the
vein
and
indeed
the
wealth
of
the
deposit
which
he
found
so
completely
indemnified
haroëris
for
his
first
disappointments
that
in
the
month

three
months
after
the
opening
of
these
workings
he
had

his

increased
so
fast

were

accompanied

made
him

that
the

the

nearer

nearer

the
limit
which
had
been
prescribed
for
her
by
nature
to
that
point
where
the
nile
receives
its
last
tributaries
and
where
its
peerless
valley
takes
its
origin
in
the
convergence
of
many
others
the
conquest
of
nubia
was
on
the
whole
an
easy
one
and
so
much
personal
advantage
accrued
from
these
wars
that
the
troops
and
generals
entered
on
them
without
the
least
repugnance
a
single
fragment
has
come
down
to
us
which
contains
a
detailed
account
of
one
of
these
campaigns
probably
that
conducted
by
usirtasen
iii
in
the
xvith
year
of
his
reign
the
pharaoh
had
received
information
that
the
tribes
of
the
district
of
hûâ
on
the
tacazze
were
harassing
his
vassals
and
possibly
also
those
egyptians
who
were
attracted
by
commerce
to
that
neighbourhood
he
resolved
to
set
out
and
chastise
them
severely
and
embarked
with
his
fleet
it
was
an
expedition
almost
entirely
devoid
of
danger
the
invaders
landed
only
at
favourable
spots
carried
off
any
of
the
inhabitants
who
came
in
their
way
and
seized
on
their
cattle
on
one
occasion
as
many
as
a
hundred
and
oxen
and
eleven
asses
on
others
less
two
small
parties
marched
along
the
banks
and
foraging
to
the
right
and
left
drove
the
booty
down
to
the
river
the
tactics
of
invasion
have
scarcely
undergone
any
change
in
these
countries
the
account
given
by
cailliaud
of
the
first
conquest
of
fazogl
by
in
might
well
serve
to
complete
the
fragments
of
the
inscription
of
usirtasen
and
restore
for
us
almost
in
every
detail
a
faithful
picture
of
the
campaigns
carried
on
in
these
regions
by
the
kings
of
the
xiith
dynasty
the
people
are
hunted
down
in
the
same
fashion
the
country
is
similarly
ravaged
by
a
handful
of
fairly
disciplined
men
attacking
naked
and
disconnected
hordes
the
young
men
are
massacred
after
a
short
resistance
or
forced
to
escape
into
the
woods
the
women
are
carried
off
as
slaves
the
huts
pillaged
villages
burnt
whole
tribes
exterminated
in
a
few
hours
sometimes
a
detachment
having
imprudently
ventured
into
some
thorny
thicket
to
attack
a
village
perched
on
a
rocky
summit
would
experience
a
reverse
and
would
with
great
difficulty
regain
the
main
body
of
troops
after
having
lost
of
its
men
in
most
cases
there
was
no
prolonged
resistance
and
the
attacking
party
carried
the
place
with
the
loss
of
merely
two
or
three
men
killed
or
wounded
the
spoil
was
never
very
considerable
in
any
one
locality
but
its
total
amount
increased
as
the
raid
was
carried
afield
and
it
soon
became
so
bulky
that
the
party
had
to
stop
and
retrace
their
steps
in
order
to
place
it
for
safety
in
the
nearest
fortress
the
booty
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
herds
of
oxen
and
of
cumbrous
heaps
of
grain
as
well
as
wood
for
building
purposes
but
it
also
comprised
objects
of
small
size
but
of
great
value
such
as
ivory
precious
stones
and
particularly
gold
the
natives
collected
the
latter
in
the
alluvial
tracts
watered
by
the
tacazze
the
blue
nile
and
its
tributaries
the
women
were
employed
in
searching
for
nuggets
which
were
often
of
considerable
size
they
enclosed
them
in
little
leather
cases
and
offered
them
to
the
merchants
in
exchange
for
products
of
egyptian
industry
or
they
handed
them
over
to
the
goldsmiths
to
be
made
into
bracelets
ear
nose
or
finger
rings
of
fairly
fine
workmanship
gold
was
found
in
combination
with
several
other
metals
from
which
they
did
not
know
how
to
separate
it
the
purest
gold
had
a
pale
yellow
tint
which
was
valued
above
all
others
but
electrum
that
is
to
say
gold
alloyed
with
silver
in
the
proportion
of
eighty
per
was
also
much
in
demand
while
gold
mixed
with
platinum
served
for
making
common
jewellery
cailliaud
has
briefly
described
the
auriferous
sand
of
the
qamâmyl
and
the
way
in
which
it
is
worked
it
is
from
him
that
i
have
borrowed
the
details
given
in
the
text
from
analyses
which
i
caused
to
be
made
at
the
bûlaq
museum
of
egyptian
jewellery
of
the
time
of
the
xviiith
dynasty
which
had
been
broken
and
were
without
value
from
an
logical
or
artistic
point
of
view
i
have
demonstrated
the
presence
of
the
platinum
and
silver
mentioned
by
cailliaud
as
being
found
in
the
nuggets
from
the
blue
nile
none
of
these
expeditions
produced
any
lasting
results
and
the
pharaohs
established
no
colonies
in
any
of
these
countries
their
egyptian
subjects
could
not
have
lived
there
for
any
length
of
time
without
deteriorating
by
intermarriage
with
the
natives
or
from
the
effects
of
the
climate
they
would
have
degenerated
into
a
race
having
all
the
vices
and
none
of
the
good
qualities
of
the
aborigines
the
pharaohs
therefore
continued
their
hostilities
without
further
scruples
and
only
sought
to
gain
as
much
as
possible
from
their
victories
they
cared
little
if
nothing
remained
after
they
had
passed
through
some
district
or
if
the
passage
of
their
armies
was
marked
only
by
ruins
they
seized
upon
everything
which
came
across
their
path
men
chattels
or
animals
and
carried
them
back
to
egypt
they
recklessly
destroyed
everything
for
which
they
had
no
use
and
made
a
desert
of
fertile
districts
which
but
yesterday
had
been
covered
with
crops
and
studded
with
populous
villages
the
neighbouring
inhabitants
realizing
their
incapacity
to
resist
regular
troops
endeavoured
to
buy
off
the
invaders
by
yielding
up
all
they
possessed
in
the
way
of
slaves
flocks
wood
or
precious
metals
the
generals
in
command
however
had
to
reckon
with
the
approaching
low
nile
which
forced
them
to
beat
a
retreat
they
were
obliged
to
halt
at
the
first
appearance
of
it
and
they
turned
homewards

their
only
anxiety
being
to
lose

of

on

king
at
several
different
times
had
sent
him
on
expeditions
to
the
soudan
but
the
inscription
in
which
he
gives
an
account
of
them
is
so
mutilated
that
we
can
not
be
sure
which
tribes
he
visited
we
learn
merely
that
he
collected
from
them
skins
ivory
ostrich
feathers
everything
in
fact
which
central
africa
has
furnished
as
articles
of
commerce
from
time
immemorial
it
was
not
however
by
land
only
that
egyptian
merchants
travelled
to
seek
fortune
in
foreign
countries
the
red
sea
attracted
them
and
served
as
a
quick
route
for
reaching
the
land
of
pûanît
whose
treasures
in
perfumes
and
rarities
of
all
kinds
had
formed
the
theme
of
ancient
traditions
and
tales
relations
with
it
had
been
infrequent
or
had
ceased
altogether
during
the
wars
of
the
period
on
their
renewal
it
was
necessary
to
open
up
afresh
routes
which
had
been
forgotten
for
centuries
illustration
the
routes
leading
from
the
nile
to
the
red
sea
between
koptos
and
kosseir
traffic
was
confined
almost
entirely
to
two
or
three
out
of
the
many
one
which
ran
from
elephantine
or
from
nekhabît
to
the
of
nekhabît
the
berenice
of
the
greeks
others
which
started
from
thebes
or
koptos
and
struck
the
coast
at
the
same
place
or
at
saû
the
present
kosseir
the
latter
which
was
the
shortest
as
well
as
the
favourite
route
passed
through
wady
hammamât
from
whence
the
pharaohs
drew
the
blocks
of
granite
for
their
sarcophagi
the
officers
who
were
sent
to
quarry
the
stone
often
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
visit
the
coast
and
to
penetrate
as
far
as
the
spice
regions
as
early
as
the
year
viii
of
sônkherî
the
predecessor
of
amenemhâît
the
hûnû
had
been
sent
by
this
road
order
to
take
the
command
of
a
squadron
to
pûanît
and
to
collect
a
tribute
of
fresh
incense
from
the
princes
of
the
he
got
together
three
thousand
men
distributed
to
each
one
a
goatskin
bottle
a
crook
for
carrying
it
and
ten
loaves
and
set
out
from
koptos
with
this
little
army
no
water
was
met
with
on
the
way
hûnû
bored
several
wells
and
cisterns
in
the
rock
one
at
a
called
bait
two
in
the
district
of
adahaît
and
finally
one
in
the
valleys
of
adabehaît
having
reached
the
seaboard
he
quickly
constructed
a
great
barge
freighted
it
with
merchandise
for
barter
as
well
as
with
provisions
oxen
cows
and
goats
and
set
sail
for
a
cruise
along
the
coast
it
is
not
known
how
far
he
went
but
he
came
back
with
a
large
cargo
of
all
the
products
of
the
land
especially
of
incense
on
his
return
he
struck
off
into
the
uagai
valley
and
thence
reached
that
of
rohanû
where
he
chose
out
splendid
blocks
of
stone
for
a
temple
which
the
king
was
building
had
sent
on
an
expedition
done
as
much
since
the
time
of
the
god
râ
numbers
of
royal
officers
and
adventurers
followed
in
his
footsteps
but
no
record
of
them
has
been
preserved
for
us
two
or
three
names
only
have
escaped
oblivion
that
of
khnûmhotpû
who
in
the
first
year
of
ûsirtasen
erected
a
stele
in
the
wady
gasûs
in
the
very
heart
of
the
land
and
that
of
khentkhîtioîrû
who
in
the
xxviiith
year
of
amenemhâît
ii
entered
the
haven
of
saû
after
a
fortunate
cruise
to
pûanît
without
having
lost
a
vessel
or
even
a
single
man
navigation
is
difficult
in
the
red
sea
the
coast
as
a
rule
is
precipitous
bristling
with
reefs
and
islets
and
almost
entirely
without
strand
or
haven
no
river
or
stream
runs
into
it
it
is
bordered
by
no
fertile
or
wooded
tract
but
by
high
cliffs
half
disintegrated
by
the
burning
sun
or
by
steep
mountains
which
appear
sometimes
a
dull
red
sometimes
a
dingy
grey
colour
according
to
the
material
granite
or
sandstone
which
predominates
in
their
composition
the
few
tribes
who
inhabit
this
desolate
region
maintain
a
miserable
existence
by
fishing
and
hunting
they
were
considered
during
the
greek
period
to
be
the
most
unfortunate
of
mortals
and
if
they
appeared
to
be
so
to
the
mariners
of
the
ptolemies
doubtless
they
enjoyed
the
same
reputation
in
the
more
remote
time
of
the
pharaohs
a
few
fishing
villages
however
are
mentioned
as
scattered
along
the
littoral
at
some
distance
apart
frequented
on
account
of
their
wells
of
brackish
water
by
the
desert
tribes
such
were
nahasît
saû
and
tâû
these
the
egyptian
used
as
victualling
stations
and
took
away
as
cargo
the
products
of
the
country
amethysts
emeralds
a
little
a
little
gold
gums
and
resins
if
the
weather
was
favourable
and
the
intake
of
merchandise
had
been
scanty
the
vessel
braving
numerous
risks
of
shipwreck
continued
its
course
as
far
as
the
latitude
of
sûakîn
and
massowah
which
was
the
beginning
of
pûanît
properly
so
called
here
riches
poured
down
to
the
coast
from
the
interior
and
selection
became
a
difficulty
it
was
hard
to
decide
which
would
make
the
best
cargo
ivory
or
ebony
skins
or
rings
of
gold
myrrh
incense
or
a
score
of
other
gums
so
many
of
these
odoriferous
resins
were
used
for
religious
purposes
that
it
was
always
to
the
advantage
of
the
merchant
to
procure
as
much
of
them
as
possible
incense
fresh
or
dried
was
the
staple
and
characteristic
merchandise
of
the
red
sea
and
the
good
people
of
egypt
pictured
pûanît
as
a
land
of
perfumes
which
attracted
the
sailor
from
afar
by
the
delicious
odours
which
were
wafted
from
it
these
voyages
were
dangerous
and
trying
popular
imagination
seized
upon
them
and
made
material
out
of
them
for
marvellous
tales
the
hero
chosen
was
always
a
daring
adventurer
sent
by
his
master
to
collect
gold
from
the
mines
of
nubia
by
sailing
further
and
further
up
the
river
he
reached
the
mysterious
sea
which
forms
the
southern
boundary
of
the
world
set
sail
in
a
vessel
one
hundred
and
fifty
cubits
long
forty
wide
with
one
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
best
sailors
in
the
land
of
egypt
who
had
seen
heaven
and
earth
and
whose
hearts
were
more
resolute
than
those
of
lions
they
had
foretold
that
the
wind
would
not
be
contrary
or
that
there
would
be
even
none
at
all
but
a
squall
came
upon
us
unexpectedly
while
we
were
in
the
open
and
as
we
approached
the
land
the
wind
freshened
and
raised
the
waves
to
the
height
of
eight
cubits
as
for
me
i
clung
to
a
beam
but
those
who
were
on
the
vessel
perished
without
one
escaping
a
wave
of
the
sea
cast
me
on
to
an
island
after
having
spent
three
days
alone
with
no
other
companion
than
my
own
heart
i
slept
there
in
the
shade
of
a
thicket
then
i
set
my
legs
in
motion
in
quest
of
something
for
my
the
island
produced
a
quantity
of
delicious
fruit
he
satisfied
his
hunger
with
it
lighted
a
fire
to
offer
a
sacrifice
to
the
gods
and
immediately
by
the
magical
power
of
the
sacred
rites
the
inhabitants
who
up
to
this
time
had
been
invisible
were
revealed
to
his
eyes
heard
a
sound
like
that
of
thunder
which
i
at
first
took
to
be
the
noise
of
the
in
the
open
sea
but
the
trees
quivered
the
earth
trembled
i
uncovered
my
face
and
i
perceived
that
it
was
a
serpent
which
was
approaching
he
was
thirty
cubits
in
length
and
his
wattles
exceeded
two
cubits
his
body
was
incrusted
with
gold
and
his
colour
appeared
like
that
of
real
lapis
he
raised
himself
before
me
and
opened
his
mouth
while
i
prostrated
myself
before
him
he
said
to
me
hath
brought
thee
who
hath
brought
thee
little
one
who
hath
brought
thee
if
thou
dost
not
tell
me
immediately
who
brought
thee
to
this
island
i
will
cause
thee
to
know
thy
littleness
either
thou
shalt
faint
like
a
woman
or
thou
shalt
tell
me
something
which
i
have
not
yet
heard
and
which
i
knew
not
before
then
he
took
me
into
his
mouth
and
carried
me
to
his
and
put
me
down
without
hurting
me
i
was
safe
and
sound
and
nothing
had
been
taken
from
our
hero
tells
the
serpent
the
story
of
his
shipwreck
which
moves
him
to
pity
and
induces
him
to
reciprocate
his
confidence
nothing
fear
nothing
little
one
let
not
thy
countenance
be
sad
if
thou
hast
come
to
me
it
is
the
god
who
has
spared
thy
life
it
is
he
who
has
brought
thee
into
this
of
the
double
where
nothing
is
lacking
and
which
is
filled
with
all
good
things
here
thou
shalt
pass
one
month
after
another
till
thou
hast
remained
four
months
in
this
island
then
shall
come
a
vessel
from
thy
country
with
mariners
thou
canst
depart
with
them
to
thy
country
and
thou
shalt
die
in
thy
city
to
converse
rejoices
the
heart
he
who
enjoys
conversation
bears
misfortune
better
i
will
therefore
relate
to
thee
the
history
of
this
the
population
consisted
of
serpents
all
of
one
family
it
formerly
comprised
also
a
young
girl
whom
a
succession
of
misfortunes
had
cast
on
the
island
and
who
was
killed
by
lightning
the
hero
charmed
with
such
good
nature
overwhelmed
the
hospitable
dragon
with
thanks
and
promised
to
send
him
numerous
presents
on
his
return
home
will
slay
asses
for
thee
in
sacrifice
i
will
pluck
birds
for
thee
i
will
send
to
thee
vessels
filled
with
all
the
riches
of
egypt
meet
for
a
god
the
friend
of
man
in
a
distant
country
unknown
to
the
monster
smiled
and
replied
that
it
was
needless
to
think
of
sending
presents
to
one
who
was
the
ruler
of
pûanît
besides
soon
as
thou
hast
quitted
this
place
thou
wilt
never
again
see
this
island
for
it
will
be
changed
into
then
when
the
vessel
appeared
according
as
he
had
predicted
to
me
i
went
and
perched
upon
a
high
tree
and
sought
to
distinguish
those
who
manned
it
i
next
ran
to
tell
him
the
news
but
i
found
that
he
was
already
informed
of
its
arrival
and
he
said
to
me
pleasant
journey
home
little
one
mayst
thou
behold
thy
children
again
and
may
thy
name
be
well
spoken
of
in
thy
town
such
are
my
wishes
for
thee
he
added
gifts
to
these
obliging
words
i
placed
all
these
on
board
the
vessel
which
had
come
and
prostrating
myself
i
adored
him
he
said
to
me
two
months
thou
shalt
reach
thy
country
thou
wilt
press
thy
children
to
thy
bosom
and
thou
shalt
rest
in
thy
after
that
i
descended
the
shore
to
the
vessel
and
i
hailed
the
sailors
who
were
in
it
i
gave
thanks
on
the
shore
to
the
master
of
the
island
as
well
as
to
those
who
dwelt
in
this
might
almost
be
an
episode
in
the
voyages
of
sindbad
the
sailor
except
that
the
monsters
which
sindbad
met
with
in
the
course
of
his
travels
were
not
of
such
a
kindly
disposition
as
the
egyptian
serpent
it
did
not
occur
to
them
to
console
the
shipwrecked
with
the
charm
of
a
lengthy
gossip
but
they
swallowed
them
with
a
healthy
appetite
putting
aside
entirely
the
marvellous
element
in
the
story
what
strikes
us
is
the
frequency
of
the
relations
which
it
points
to
between
egypt
and
pûanît
the
appearance
of
an
egyptian
vessel
excites
no
astonishment
on
its
coasts
the
inhabitants
have
already
seen
many
such
and
at
such
regular
intervals
that
they
are
able
to
predict
the
exact
date
of
their
arrival
the
distance
between
the
two
countries
it
is
true
was
not
considerable
and
a
voyage
of
two
months
was
sufficient
to
accomplish
it
while
the
new
egypt
was
expanding
outwards
in
all
directions
the
old
country
did
not
cease
to
add
to
its
riches
the
two
centuries
during
which
the
xiith
dynasty
continued
to
rule
were
a
period
of
profound
peace
the
monuments
show
us
the
country
in
full
possession
of
all
its
resources
and
its
arts
and
its
inhabitants
both
cheerful
and
contented
more
than
ever
do
the
great
lords
and
royal
officers
expatiate
in
their
epitaphs
upon
the
strict
justice
which
they
have
rendered
to
their
vassals
and
subordinates
upon
the
kindness
which
they
have
shown
to
the
fellahîn
on
the
paternal
solicitude
with
which
in
the
years
of
insufficient
inundations
or
of
bad
harvests
they
have
striven
to
come
forward
and
assist
them
and
upon
the
disinterestedness
which
kept
them
from
raising
the
taxes
during
the
times
of
average
niles
or
of
unusual
plenty
gifts
to
the
gods
poured
in
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
and
the
great
building
works
which
had
been
at
a
standstill
since
the
end
of
the
vith
dynasty
were
recommenced
simultaneously
on
all
sides
there
was
much
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
repairing
the
ruins
of
which
the
number
had
accumulated
during
the
two
preceding
centuries
not
that
the
most
audacious
kings
had
ventured
to
lay
their
hands
on
the
sanctuaries
they
emptied
the
sacred
treasuries
and
partially
confiscated
their
revenues
but
when
once
their
cupidity
was
satisfied
they
respected
the
fabrics
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
restore
a
few
inscriptions
or
when
needed
to
replace
a
few
stones
these
magnificent
buildings
required
careful
supervision
in
spite
of
their
being
constructed
of
the
most
durable
materials
granite
limestone
in
spite
of
their
enormous
size
or
of
the
strengthening
of
their
foundations
by
a
bed
of
sand
and
by
three
or
four
courses
of
carefully
adjusted
blocks
to
form
a
substructure
the
nile
was
ever
threatening
them
and
secretly
working
at
their
destruction
its
waters
filtering
through
the
soil
were
perpetually
in
contact
with
the
lower
courses
of
these
buildings
and
kept
the
foundations
of
the
walls
and
the
bases
of
the
columns
constantly
damp
the
saltpetre
which
the
waters
had
dissolved
in
their
passage
crystallising
on
the
limestone
would
corrode
and
undermine
everything
if
precautions
were
not
taken
when
the
inundation
was
over
the
subsidence
of
the
water
which
impregnated
the
subsoil
caused
in
course
of
time
settlements
in
the
most
solid
foundations
the
walls
disturbed
by
the
unequal
sinking
of
the
ground
got
out
of
the
perpendicular
and
cracked
this
shifting
displaced
the
architraves
which
held
the
columns
together
and
the
stone
slabs
which
formed
the
roof
these
disturbances
aggravated
from
year
to
year
were
sufficient
if
not
at
once
remedied
to
entail
the
fall
of
the
portions
attacked
in
addition
to
this
the
nile
having
threatened
the
part
below
with
destruction
often
hastened
by
direct
attacks
the
work
of
ruin
which
otherwise
proceeded
slowly
a
breach
in
the
embankments
protecting
the
town
or
the
temple
allowed
its
waters
to
rush
violently
through
and
thus
to
effect
large
gaps
in
the
decaying
walls
completing
the
overthrow
of
the
columns
and
wrecking
the
entrance
halls
and
secret
chambers
by
the
fall
of
the
roofs
at
the
time
when
egypt
came
under
the
rule
of
the
xiith
dynasty
there
were
but
few
cities
which
did
not
contain
some
ruined
or
dilapidated
sanctuary
amenemhâît
although
fully
occupied
in
reducing
the
power
of
the
feudal
lords
restored
the
temples
as
far
as
he
was
able
and
his
successors
pushed
forward
the
work
vigorously
for
nearly
two
centuries
the
delta
profited
greatly
by
this
activity
in
building
the
monuments
there
had
suffered
more
than
anywhere
else

to
bear
the
first
shock
of
foreign
invasion
and
transformed
into
fortresses
while
the
towns
in
which
they
were
situated
were
besieged
they
have
been
captured
again
and
again
by
assault
broken
down
by
attacking

and
dismantled
by
all
the
conquerors
of
egypt
from
the
assyrians
to
the
arabs
and
the
turks
the
fellahîn
in
their
neighbourhood

for
centuries
come
to
them
to
obtain
limestone
to
burn
in
their
kilns

to
use
them
as
a
quarry

vestiges
of
the

that
the
main

of
the

was
of

a

the

preserved
for
us
a
portrait
of

and
wears
the
tall
of

he
has
a
large
smiling
face
thick

a
short
nose
and
big
staring

the
expression
is
one
of
benevolence
and
gentleness
rather
than
of
the
energy
and
firmness
which
one
would
expect
in
the
founder
of
a
dynasty
the
kings
who
were
his
successors
all
considered
it
a
privilege
to
embellish
the
temple

to
place
in
it

memorial
of
their
veneration

god

from
the

i
believe
i
can
recognize
another
portrait
of
the
same
queen
in
a
beautiful
statue
in
black
granite
which
has
been
in
the
museum
at
marseilles
since
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
these
various
statues
have
all
an
evident
artistic
relationship
to
the
beautiful
granite
figures
of
the
ancient
empire
the
sculptors
who
executed
them
belonged
to
the
same
school
as
those
who
carved
khephren
out
of
the
solid
diorite
there
is
the
same
facile
use
of
the
chisel
the
same
indifference
to
the
difficulties
presented
by
the
material
chosen
the
same
finish
in
the
detail
the
same
knowledge
of
the
human
form
one
is
almost
tempted
to
believe
that
egyptian
art
remained
unchanged
all
through
those
long
centuries
and
yet
as
soon
as
a
statue
of
the
early
period
is
placed
side
by
side
with
one
of
the
xiith
dynasty
we
immediately
perceive
something
in
the
one
which
is
lacking
in
the
other
it
is
a
difference
in
feeling
even
if
the
technique
remains
unmodified
it
was
the
man
himself
that
the
sculptors
desired
to
represent
in
the
older
pharaohs
and
however
haughty
may
be
the
countenance
which
we
admire
in
the
khephren
it
is
the
human
element
which
predominates
in
him
the
statues
of
amenemhâît
and
his
successors
appear
on
the
contrary
to
represent
a
superior
race
at
the
time
when
these
were
produced
the
pharaoh
had
long
been
regarded
as
a
god
and
the
divine
nature
in
him
had
almost
eliminated
the
human
whether
intentionally
or
otherwise
the
sculptors
idealized
their
model
and
made
him
more
and
more
resemble
the
type
of
the
divinities
the
head
always
appears
to
be
a
good
likeness
but
smoothed
down
and
sometimes
lacking
in
expression
not
only
are
the
marks
of
age
rendered
less
apparent
and
the
features
made
to
bear
the
stamp
of
perpetual
youth
but
the
characteristics
of
the
individual
such
as
the
accentuation
of
the
eyebrows
the
protuberance
of
the
the
projection
of
the
under
lip
are
all
softened
down
as
if
intentionally
and
made
to
give
way
to
a
uniform
expression
of
majestic
tranquillity
one
king
only
amenemhâît
refused
to
go
down
to
posterity
thus
effaced
and
caused
his
portrait
to
be
taken
as
he
really
was
he
has
certainly
the
round
full
face
of
amenemhâît
or
of
usirtasen
and
there
is
an
undeniable
family
likeness
between
him
and
his
ancestors
but
at
the
first
glance
we
feel
sure
that
the
artist
has
not
in
any
way
flattered
his
model
the
forehead
is
low
and
slightly
retreating
narrow
across
the
temples
his
nose
is
aquiline
pronounced
in
form
and
large
at
the
tip
the
thick
lips
are
slightly
closed
his
mouth
has
a
disdainful
curve
and
its
corners
are
turned
down
as
if
to
repress
the
inevitable
smile
common
to
most
egyptian
statues
the
chin
is
full
and
heavy
and
turns
up
in
front
in
spite
of
the
weight
of
the
false
beard
dependent
from
it
he
has
small
narrow
eyes
with
full
lids
his
cheekbones
are
accentuated
and
projecting
the
cheeks
hollow
and
the
muscles
about
the
nose
and
mouth
strongly
defined
the
whole
presents
so
strange
an
aspect
that
for
a
long
time
statues
of
this
type
have
been
persistently
looked
upon
as
productions
of
an
art
which
was
only
partially
egyptian
it
is
indeed
possible
that
the
tanis
sphinxes
were
turned
out
of
workshops
where
the
principles
and
practice
of
the
art
had
previously
undergone
some
asiatic
influence
the
bushy
mane
which
surrounds
the
face
and
the
ears
emerging
from
it
are
exclusively
characteristic
of
the
latter
the
purely
human
statues
in
which
we
meet
with
the
same
type
of
countenance
have
no
peculiarity
of
workmanship
which
could
be
attributed
to
the
imitation
of
a
foreign
art
if
the
nameless
masters
to
whom
we
owe
their
existence
desired
to
bring
about
a
reaction
against
the
conventional
technique
of
their
contemporaries
they
at
least
introduced
no
foreign
innovations
the
monuments
of
the
memphite
period
furnished
them
with
all
the
models
they
could
possibly
wish
for
bubastis
had
no
less
occasion
than
tanis
to
boast
of
the
generosity
of
the
theban
pharaohs
the
temple
of
bastît
which
had
been
decorated
by
kheops
and
khephren
was
still
in
existence
amenemhâît
usirtasen
and
their
immediate
successors
confined
themselves
to
the
restoration
of
several
chambers
and
to
the
erection
of
their
own
statues
but
usirtasen
iii
added
to
it
a
new
structure
which
must
have
made
it
rival
the
finest
monuments
in
egypt
he
believed
no
doubt
that
he
was
under
particular
obligations
to
the
lioness
goddess
of
the
city
and
attributed
to
her
aid
for
unknown
reasons
some
of
his
successes
in
nubia
it
would
appear
that
it
was
with
the
spoil
of
a
campaign
against
the
country

endowed

sanctuary

in

the
whole

part

the
booty
had
been
consecrated
to
the
use

the

divinity

now
remains
of
it

fragments

are
restored

we
need
to
glance
at
the

our

some
two
thousand

a

which
was
inhabited
by
the

employed

who
resided
there
with

the
remains
of
the
temple
consist
of
scarcely
anything
more
than
the
enclosing
wall
whose
sides
were
originally
faced
with
fine
white
limestone
covered
with
hieroglyphs
and
sculptured
scenes
it
adjoined
the
wall
of
the
town
and
the
neighbouring
quarters
are
almost
intact
the
streets
were
straight
and
crossed
each
other
at
right
angles

the
houses
on
each
side
were
so
regularly
built
that
a
single
policeman
could
keep
his
eye
on

the

began
to
dwindle
after
the

had
taken
possession
of
his
sepulchre
it
was
abandoned
during
the
xiiith
dynasty
and
its
ruins
were
entombed
in

sand
which
the
wind
heaped
over
them
the
city
which
amenemhâît

had
connected
with
his
tomb
maintained
on
the
contrary
a
long
existence
in
the
course
of
the
centuries
the
last
consisted
of
a
large
sarcophagus
of
quartzose
sandstone
while
his
favourite
consort
nofriuphtah
reposed
beside
him
in
a
smaller
coffin
the
sepulchral
chapel
was
very
large
and
its
arrangements
were
of
a
somewhat
complicated
character
it
consisted
of
a
considerable
number
of
chambers
some
tolerably
large
and
others
of
moderate
dimensions
while
all
of
them
were
difficult
of
access
and
plunged
in
perpetual
darkness
this
was
the
egyptian
labyrinth
to
which
the
greeks
by
a
misconception
have
given
a
renown
amenemhâît
iii
or
his
architects
had
no
intention
of
building
such
a
childish
structure
as
that
in
which
classical
tradition
so
fervently
believed
he
had
richly
endowed
the
attendant
priests
and
bestowed
upon
the
cult
of
his
double
considerable
revenues
and
the
chambers
above
mentioned
were
so
many
storehouses
for
the
safekeeping
of
the
treasure
and
provisions
for
the
dead
and
the
arrangement
of
them
was
not
more
singular
than
that
of
ordinary
storage
depots
as
his
cult
persisted
for
a
long
period
the
temple
was
maintained
in
good
condition
during
a
considerable
time
it
had
not
perhaps
been
abandoned
when
the
greeks
first
visited
it
the
identity
of
the
ruins
at
hawâra
with
the
remains
of
the
labyrinth
admitted
by
and
by
lepsius
disputed
by
vassali
has
been
definitely
proved
by
pétrie
who
found

erected
by
amenemhâît

under
the
ruins
of
a
village
and
some
tombs
the
other
sovereigns
of
the
xiith
dynasty
must
have
been
interred
not
far
from
the
tombs
of
amenemhâît
iii
and
usirtasen
ii
they
also
had
their
pyramids
of
which
we
may
one
day
discover
the
site
the
outline
of
these
was
almost
the
same
as
that
of
the
memphite
pyramids
but
the
interior
arrangements
were
different
as
at
illahun
and
dahshur
the
mass
of
the
work
consisted
of
crude
bricks
of
large
size
between
which
fine
sand
was
introduced
to
bind
them
solidly
together
and
the
whole
was
covered
with
a
facing
of
polished
limestone
the
passages
and
chambers
are
not
arranged
on
the
simple
plan
which
we
meet
with
in
the
pyramids
of
earlier
date
experience
had
taught
the
pharaohs
that
neither
granite
walls
nor
the
multiplication
of
barriers
could
preserve
their
mummies
from
profanation
no
sooner
was
vigilance
relaxed
either
in
the
time
of
civil
war
or
under
a
feeble
administration
than
robbers
appeared
on
the
scene
and
boring
passages
through
the
masonry
with
the
ingenuity
of
moles
they
at
length
after
indefatigable
patience
succeeded
in
reaching
the
sepulchral
vault
and
despoiling
the
mummy
of
its
valuables

taken
in
with
a
view
to
further
protection
the
builders
multiplied
blind
passages
and
chambers
without
apparent
exit
but
in
which
a
portion
of
the
ceiling
was
movable
and
gave
access
to
other
equally
mysterious
rooms

corridors

sunk
in
the
corners
of
the
chambers

the
sacrilegious
intruder
on

after
causing
him
a
great
loss

day
the

of

the
central
chamber
of
the
hawâra
pyramid
and
covers
the
sarcophagus
it
is
possible
that
this
was
foreseen
and
that
the
builders
counted
on
the
infiltration
as
an
additional
obstacle
to
depredations
from
without
indeed
it
should
be
noted
that
in
the
period
the
presence
of
water
in
a
certain
number
of
the
pyramids
was
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
so
frequently
was
it
met
with
that
it
was
even
supposed
to
exist
in
a
pyramid
into
which
water
had
never
penetrated
viz
that
of
kheops
herodotus
relates
that
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
interpreters
who
acted
as
his
guides
the
waters
of
the
nile
were
carried
to
the
sepulchral
cavern
of
the
pharaoh
by
a
subterranean
channel
and
shut
it
in
on
all
sides
like
an
island
the
hardness
of
the
cement
which
fastens
the
lid
of
the
stone
coffin
to
the
lower
part
protects
the
body
from
damp
and
the
pharaoh
lying
beneath
several
feet
of
water
still
defies
the
greed
of
the
robber
or
the
zeal
of
the
archaeologist
the
absolute
power
of
the
kings
kept
their
feudal
vassals
in
check
far
from
being
suppressed
however
the
seignorial
families
continued
not
only
to
exist
but
to
enjoy
continued
prosperity

at
elephantine
koptos
thinis
in
aphroditopolis
and
in
most
of
the
cities
of
the

and
of
the

there
were
ruling
princes
who
were
descended
from
the
old
feudal
lords
or
even
from
pharaohs
of
the
memphite
period

who
were

superior

it

centuries

conception

to

preserve

added

precautions

most
conscientious
observation

customs
were
not
sufficient

perpetuate
the

not

the
descendants

desire

enlarging

together
with
sufficient
ability
to
realize
their

we
can

picture
from

history
what
egyptian
feudalism
really
was
what
were
its
component
elements
what
were
the
resources
it
had
at

we
may
well
be
astonished

must
have

establish
the

there
succeeded

contemporaneously

we
at
