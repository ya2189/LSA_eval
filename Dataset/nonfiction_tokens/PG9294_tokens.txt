no
work
has
appeared
from
the
american
press
within
the
past
few
years
better
calculated

narrative
of
his
exploring
expedition
to
the
rocky

undertaken
by
the

government
eminently
qualified
for
the
task
assigned
him
colonel
fremont
entered
upon
his
duties
with
alacrity
and
has
embodied
in
the
following
pages
the
results
of
his
observations
the
country
thus
explored
is
daily
making
deeper
and
more
abiding
impressions
upon
the
minds
of
the
people
and
information
is
eagerly
sought
in

to
its
natural
resources
its
climate
inhabitants
productions
and
adaptation
for
supplying
the
wants
and
providing
the
comforts
for
a
dense
population
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
that
territory
hitherto
so
little
known
will
be
intersected
by
railroads
its
waters
navigated
and
its
fertile
portions
peopled
by
an
active

intelligent
population

the
successful
extension
of
our
free
institutions
over
this
now
wilderness
portion
of
our

this
work
of
fremont
commends
itself
as
a
faithful
and
accurate
statement
of
the
present
state
of
affairs
in
that
country
since
the
preparation
of
this
report
colonel
fremont
has
been
engaged
in
still
farther
explorations
by
order
of
the
government
the
results
of
which
will
probably
be
presented
to
the
country
as
soon
as
he
shall
be
relieved
from
his
present
arduous
and
responsible
station
he
is
now
engaged
in
active
military
service
in
new
mexico
and
has
won
imperishable
renown
by
his
rapid
and
successful
subjugation
of
that
country
the
map
accompanying
this
edition
is
not
the
one
prepared
by
the

it
is
one
that
can

we
proceeded
twelve
miles
to
cyprian
chouteau
where
we
completed
our
final
arrangements
for
the
expedition
bad
weather
which
interfered
with
astronomical
observations
delayed
us
several
days
in
the
early
part
of
june
at
this
post
which
is
on
the
right
bank
of
the
kansas
river
about
ten
miles
above
the
mouth
and
six
beyond
the
western
boundary
of
missouri
the
sky
cleared
off
at
length
and
we
were
enabled
to
determine
our
position
in
longitude
and
latitude
the
elevation
above
the
sea
is
about
feet
our
camp
in
the
mean
time
presented
an
animated
and
bustling
scene
all
were
busily
engaged
in
completing
the
necessary
arrangements
for
our
campaign
in
the
wilderness
and
profiting
by
this
short
stay
on
the
verge
of
civilization
to
provide
ourselves
with
all
the
little
essentials
to
comfort
in
the
nomadic
life
we
were
to
lead
for
the
ensuing
summer
months
gradually
however
every
thing
the
of
the
camp
men
horses
and
even
mules
settled
into
its
place
and
by
the
we
were
ready
to
depart
but
before
we
mount
our
horses
i
will
give

mind
and
body
such
an
expedition
would
give
we
were
well
armed
and
mounted
with
the
exception
of
eight
men
who
conducted
as
many
carts
in
which
were
packed
our
stores
with
the
baggage
and
instruments
and
which
were
drawn
by
two
mules
a
few
loose
horses
and
four
oxen
which
had
been
added
to
our
stock
of
provisions
completed
the
train
we
set
out
on
the
morning
of
the
which
happened
to
be
friday
a
circumstance
which
our
men
did
not
fail
to
remember
and
recall
during
the
hardships
and
vexations
of
the
ensuing
journey
cyprian
chouteau
to
whose
kindness
during
our
stay
at
his
house
we
were
much
indebted
accompanied
us
several
miles
on
our
way
until
we
met
an
indian
whom
he
had
engaged
to
conduct
us
on
the
first
thirty
or
forty
miles
where
he
was
to
consign
us
to
the
ocean
of
prairie
which
we
were
told
stretched
without
interruption
almost
to
the
base
of
the
rocky
mountains
from
the
belt
of
wood
which
borders
the
kansas
in
which
we
had
passed
several
indian
farms
we
suddenly
emerged
on
the
prairies
which
received
us
at
the
outset
with
some
of
their
striking
characteristics
for
here
and
there
rode
an
indian
and
but
a
few
miles
distant
heavy
clouds
of
smoke
were
rolling
before
the
fire
in
about
ten
miles
we
reached
the
santa
fé
road
along
which
we
continued
for
a
short
time
and
encamped
early
on
a
small
stream
having
traveled
about
eleven
miles
during
our
journey
it
was
the
customary
practice
to
encamp
an
hour
or
two
before
sunset
when
the
carts
were
disposed
so
as
to
form
a
sort
of
barricade
around
a
circle
some
eighty
yards
in
diameter
the
tents
were
pitched
and
the
horses
hobbled
and
turned
loose
to
graze
and
but
a
few
minutes
elapsed
before
the
cooks
of
the
messes
of
which
there
were
four
were
busily
engaged
in
preparing
the
evening
meal
at
nightfall
the
horses
mules
and
oxen
were
driven
in
and
picketed
that
is
secured
by
a
halter
of
which
one
end
was
tied
to
a
small
picket
and
driven
into
the
ground
the
halter
being
twenty
or
thirty
feet
long
which
enabled
them
to
obtain
a
little
food
during
the
night
when
we
had
reached
a
part
of
the
country
where
such
a
precaution
became
necessary
the
carts
being
regularly
arranged
for
defending
the
camp
guard
was
mounted
at
eight
consisting
of
three
men
who
were
relieved
every
two
hours
the
being
for
the
day
at
daybreak
the
camp
was
roused
the
animals
turned
loose
to
graze
and
breakfast
generally
over
between
six
and
seven
when
we
resumed
our
march
making
regularly
a
halt
at
noon
for
one
or
two
hours
such
was
usually
the
order
of
the
day
except
when
accident
of
country
forced
a
variation
which
however
happened
but
rarely
we
traveled
the
next
day
along
the
santa
fé
road
which
we
left
in
the
afternoon
and
encamped
late
in
the
evening
on
a
small
creek
called
by
the
indians
mishmagwi
just
as
we
arrived
at
camp
one
of
the
horses
set
off
at
full
speed
on
his
return
and
was
followed
by
others
several
men
were
sent
in
pursuit
and
returned
with
the
fugitives
about
midnight
with
the
exception
of
one
man
who
did
not
make
his
appearance
until
morning
he
had
lost
his
way
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
slept
on
the
prairie
shortly
after
midnight
it
began
to
rain
heavily
and
as
our
tents
were
of
light
and
thin
cloth
they
offered
but
little
obstruction
to
the
rain
we
were
all
well
soaked
and
glad
when
morning
came
we
had
a
rainy
march
on
the
but
the
weather
grew
fine
as
the
day
advanced
we
encamped
in
a
remarkably
beautiful
situation
on
the
kansas
bluffs
which
commanded
a
fine
view
of
the
river
valley
here
from
four
to
five
miles
wide
the
central
portion
was
occupied
by
a
broad
belt
of
heavy
timber
and
nearer
the
hills
the
prairies
were
of
the
richest
verdure
one
of
the
oxen
was
killed
here
for
food
we
reached
the
ford
of
the
kansas
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
where
the
river
was
two
hundred
and
thirty
yards
wide
and
commenced
immediately
preparations
for
crossing
i
had
expected
to
find
the
river
fordable
but
it
had
swollen
by
the
late
rains
and
was
sweeping
by
with
an
angry
current
yellow
and
turbid
as
the
missouri
up
to
this
point
the
road
we
had
traveled
was
a
remarkably
fine
one
well
beaten
and
level
the
usual
road
of
a
prairie
country
by
our
route
the
ford
was
one
hundred
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
kansas
river
several
mounted
men
led
the
way
into
the
stream
to
swim
across
the
animals
were
driven
in
after
them
and
in
a
few
minutes
all
had
reached
the
opposite
bank
in
safety
with
the
exception
of
the
oxen
which
swam
some
distance
down
the
river
and
returning
to
the
right
bank
were
not
got
over
till
the
next
morning
in
the
mean
time
the
carts
had
been
unloaded
and
dismantled
and
an
boat
which
i
had
brought
with
me
for
the
survey
of
the
platte
river
placed
in
the
water
the
boat
was
twenty
feet
long
and
five
broad
and
on
it
were
placed
the
body
and
wheels
of
a
cart
with
the
load
belonging
to
it
and
three
men
with
paddles
the
velocity
of
the
current
and
the
inconvenient
freight
rendering
it
difficult
to
be
managed
basil
lajeunesse
one
of
our
best
swimmers
took
in
his
teeth
a
line
attached
to
the
boat
and
swam
ahead
in
order
to
reach
a
footing
as
soon
as
possible
and
assist
in
drawing
her
over
in
this
manner
six
passages
had
been
successfully
made
and
as
many
carts
with
their
contents
and
a
greater
portion
of
the
party
deposited
on
the
left
bank
but
night
was
drawing
near
and
in
our
anxiety
to
have
all
over
before
the
darkness
closed
in
i
put
upon
the
boat
the
remaining
two
carts
with
their
accompanying
load
the
man
at
the
helm
was
timid
on
water
and
in
his
alarm
capsized
the
boat
carts
barrels
boxes
and
bales
were
in
a
moment
floating
down
the
current
but
all
the
men
who
were
on
the
shore
jumped
into
the
water
without
stopping
to
think
if
they
could
swim
and
almost
every
thing
even
heavy
articles
such
as
guns
and
lead
was
recovered
two
of
the
men
who
could
not
swim
came
nigh
being
drowned
and
all
the
sugar
belonging
to
one
of
the
messes
wasted
its
sweets
on
the
muddy
waters
but
our
heaviest
loss
was
a
large
bag
of
coffee
which
contained
nearly
all
our
provision
it
was
a
loss
which
none
but
a
traveler
in
a
strange
and
inhospitable
country
can
appreciate
and
often
afterward
when
excessive
toil
and
long
marching
had
overcome
us
with
fatigue
and
weariness
we
remembered
and
mourned
over
our
loss
in
the
kansas
carson
and
maxwell
had
been
much
in
the
water
yesterday
and
both
in
consequence
were
taken
ill
the
former
continuing
so
i
remained
in
camp
a
number
of
kansas
indians
visited
us
going
up
to
one
of
the
groups
who
were
scattered
among
the
trees
i
found
one
sitting
on
the
ground
among
some
of
the
men
gravely
and
fluently
speaking
french
with
as
much
facility
and
as
little
embarrassment
as
any
of
my
own
party
who
were
nearly
all
of
french
origin
on
all
sides
was
heard
the
strange
language
of
his
own
people
wild
and
harmonizing
well
with
their
appearance
i
listened
to
him
for
some
time
with
feelings
of
strange
curiosity
and
interest
he
was
now
apparently
years
of
age
and
on
inquiry
i
learned
that
he
had
been
at
louis
when
a
boy
and
there
had
learned
the
french
language
from
one
of
the
indian
women
i
obtained
a
fine
cow
and
calf
in
exchange
for
a
yoke
of
oxen
several
of
them
brought
us
vegetables
pumpkins
onions
beans
and
lettuce
one
of
them
brought
butter
and
from
a
near
the
river
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
obtain
some
twenty
or
thirty
pounds
of
coffee
the
dense
timber
in
which
we
had
encamped
interfered
with
astronomical
observations
and
our
wet
and
damaged
stores
required
exposure
to
the
sun
accordingly
the
tents
were
struck
early
the
next
morning
and
leaving
camp
at
six
we
moved
about
seven
miles
up
the
river
to
a
handsome
open
prairie
some
twenty
feet
above
the
water
where
the
fine
grass
afforded
a
luxurious
repast
to
our
horses
during
the
day
we
occupied
ourselves
in
making
astronomical
observations
in
order
to
lay
down
the
country
to
this
place
it
being
our
custom
to
keep
up
our
map
regularly
in
the
field
which
we
found
attended
with
many
advantages
the
men
were
kept
busy
in
drying
the
provisions
painting
the
cart
covers
and
otherwise
completing
our
equipage
until
the
afternoon
when
powder
was
distributed
to
them
and
they
spent
some
hours
in
firing
at
a
mark
we
were
now
fairly
in
the
indian
country
and
it
began
to
be
time
to
prepare
for
the
chances
of
the
wilderness
the
weather
yesterday
had
not
permitted
us
to
make
the
observations
i
was
desirous
to
obtain
here
and
i
therefore
did
not
move
the
people
continued
their
target
firing
in
the
steep
bank
of
the
river
here
were
nests
of
innumerable
swallows
into
one
of
which
a
large
prairie
snake
had
got
about
half
his
body
and
was
occupied
in
eating
the
young
birds
the
old
ones
were
flying
about
in
great
distress
darting
at
him
and
vainly
endeavoring
to
drive
him
off
a
shot
wounded
him
and
being
killed
he
was
cut
open
and
eighteen
young
swallows
were
found
in
his
body
a
sudden
storm
that
burst
upon
us
in
the
afternoon
cleared
away
in
a
brilliant
sunset
followed
by
a
clear
night
which
enabled
us
to
determine
our
position
in
longitude
and
in
latitude
a
party
of
emigrants
to
the
columbia
river
under
the
charge
of
white
an
agent
of
the
government
in
oregon
territory
were
about
three
weeks
in
advance
of
us
they
consisted
of
men
women
and
children
there
were
men
and
sixteen
or
seventeen
families
they
had
a
considerable
number
of
cattle
and
were
transporting
their
household
furniture
in
large
heavy
wagons
i
understood
that
there
had
been
much
sickness
among
them
and
that
they
had
lost
several
children
one
of
the
party
who
had
lost
his
child
and
whose
wife
was
very
ill
had
left
them
about
one
hundred
miles
hence
on
the
prairies
and
as
a
hunter
who
had
accompanied
them
visited
our
camp
this
evening
we
availed
ourselves
of
his
return
to
the
states
to
write
to
our
friends
the
morning
of
the
was
very
unpleasant
a
fine
rain
was
falling
with
cold
wind
from
the
north
and
mists
made
the
river
hills
look
dark
and
gloomy
we
left
our
camp
at
seven
journeying
along
the
foot
of
the
hills
which
border
the
kansas
valley
generally
about
three
miles
wide
and
extremely
rich
we
halted
for
dinner
after
a
march
of
about
thirteen
miles
on
the
banks
of
one
of
the
many
little
tributaries
to
the
kansas
which
look
like
trenches
in
the
prairie
and
are
usually
well
timbered
after
crossing
this
stream
i
rode
off
some
miles
to
the
left
attracted
by
the
appearance
of
a
cluster
of
huts
near
the
mouth
of
the
vermilion
it
was
a
large
but
deserted
kansas
village
scattered
in
an
open
wood
along
the
margin
of
the
stream
chosen
with
the
customary
indian
fondness
for
beauty
of
scenery
the
pawnees
had
attacked
it
in
the
early
spring
some
of
the
houses
were
burnt
and
others
blackened
with
smoke
and
weeds
were
already
getting
possession
of
the
cleared
places
riding
up
the
vermilion
river
i
reached
the
ford
in
time
to
meet
the
carts
and
crossing
encamped
on
its
western
side
the
weather
continued
cold
the
thermometer
being
this
evening
as
low
as
but
the
night
was
sufficiently
clear
for
astronomical
observations
which
placed
us
in
longitude
and
latitude
at
sunset
the
barometer
was
at
thermometer
we
breakfasted
the
next
morning
at
five
and
left
our
encampment
early
the
morning
was
cool
the
thermometer
being
at
quitting
the
river
bottom
the
road
ran
along
the
uplands
over
a
rolling
country
generally
in
view
of
the
kansas
from
eight
to
twelve
miles
distant
many
large
boulders
of
a
very
compact
sandstone
of
various
shades
of
red
some
of
them
of
four
or
five
tons
in
weight
were
scattered
along
the
hills
and
many
beautiful
plants
in
flower
among
which
the
was
a
characteristic
enlivened
the
green
of
the
prairie
at
the
heads
of
the
ravines
i
remarked
occasionally
thickets
of
the
most
common
willow
of
the
country
we
traveled
nineteen
miles
and
pitched
our
tents
at
evening
on
the
of
a
small
creek
now
nearly
dry
but
having
in
its
bed
several
fine
springs
the
barometer
indicated
a
considerable
rise
in
the
country
here
about
fourteen
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
and
the
increased
elevation
appeared
already
to
have
some
slight
influence
upon
vegetation
the
night
was
cold
with
a
heavy
dew
the
thermometer
at
standing
at
barometer
our
position
was
in
longitude
and
latitude
the
morning
of
the
was
fine
with
a
southerly
breeze
and
a
bright
sky
and
at
seven
we
were
on
the
march
the
country
was
rather
more
broken
rising
still
and
covered
everywhere
with
fragments
of
silicious
limestone
particularly
on
the
summits
where
they
were
small
and
thickly
strewed
as
pebbles
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
in
these
exposed
situations
grew
but
few
plants
though
whenever
the
soil
was
good
and
protected
from
the
winds
in
the
creek
bottoms
and
ravines
and
on
the
slopes
they
flourished
abundantly
among
them
the
still
retaining
its
characteristic
place
we
crossed
at
the
big
vermilion
which
has
a
rich
bottom
of
about
one
mile
in
breadth
of
which
is
occupied
by
timber
making
our
usual
halt
at
noon
after
a
day
march
of
miles
we
reached
the
big
blue
and
encamped
on
the
uplands
of
the
western
side
near
a
small
creek
where
was
a
fine
large
spring
of
very
cold
water
this
is
a
clear
and
handsome
stream
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
wide
running
with
a
rapid
current
through
a
valley
antelope
were
seen
running
over
the
hills
and
at
evening
carson
brought
us
a
fine
deer

of
the
camp
latitude
thermometer
at
sunset
a
pleasant
southerly
breeze
and
fine
morning
had
given
place
to
a
gale
with
indications
of
bad
weather
when
after
a
march
of
ten
miles
we
halted
to
noon
on
a
small
creek
where
the
water
stood
in
deep
pools
in
the
bank
of
the
creek
limestone
made
its
appearance
in
a
stratum
about
one
foot
thick
in
the
afternoon
the
people
seemed
to
suffer
for
want
of
water
the
road
led
along
a
high
dry
ridge
dark
lines
of
timber
indicated
the
heads
of
streams
in
the
plains
below
but
there
was
no
water
near
and
the
day
was
oppressive
with
a
hot
wind
and
the
thermometer
at
along
our
route
the
has
been
in
very
abundant
but
variable
bloom
in
some
places
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
purple
clusters
in
others
without
a
flower
it
seemed
to
love
best
the
sunny
slopes
with
a
dark
soil
and
southern
exposure
everywhere
the
rose
is
met
with
and
reminds
us
of
cultivated
gardens
and
civilization
it
is
scattered
over
the
prairies
in
small
bouquets
and
when
glittering
in
the
dews
and
waving
in
the
pleasant
breeze
of
the
early
morning
is
the
most
beautiful
of
the
prairie
flowers
the
absinthe
or
prairie
sage
as
it
is
variously
called
is
increasing
in
size
and
glittering
like
silver
as
the
southern
breeze
turns
up
its
leaves
to
the
sun
all
these
plants
have
their
insect
inhabitants
variously
colored
taking
generally
the
hue
of
the
flower
on
which
they
live
the
has
its
small
fly
accompanying
it
through
every
change
of
elevation
and
latitude
and
wherever
i
have
seen
the
i
have
always
remarked
too
on
the
flower
a
large
butterfly
so
nearly
resembling
it
in
color
as
to
be
distinguishable
at
a
little
distance
only
by
the
motion
of
its
wings
traveling
on
the
fresh
traces
of
the
oregon
emigrants
relieve
a
little
the
loneliness
of
the
road
and
after
a
march
of
miles
we
halted
on
a
small
creek
which
had
been
one
of
their
encampments
as
we
advanced
westward
the
soil
appears
to
be
getting
more
sandy
and
the
surface
rock
an
erratic
deposite
of
sand
and
gravel
rests
here
on
a
bed
of
coarse
yellow
and
gray
and
very
friable
sandstone
evening
closed
over
with
rain
and
its
usual
attendant
hordes
of
mosquitoes
with
which
we
were
annoyed
for
the
first
time
we
enjoyed
at
breakfast
this
morning
a
luxury
very
unusual
in
this
country
in
a
cup
of
excellent
coffee
with
cream
from
our
cow
being
milked
at
night
cream
was
thus
had
in
the
morning
our
halt
was
at
wyeth
creek
in
the
bed
of
which
were
numerous
boulders
of
dark
ferruginous
sandstone
mingled
with
others
of
the
red
sandstone
already
mentioned
here
a
pack
of
cards
lying
loose
on
the
grass
marked
an
encampment
of
our
oregon
emigrants
and
it
was
at
the
close
of
the
day
when
we
made
our
bivouac
in
the
midst
of
some
ravines
near
the
little
blue
miles
from
our
camp
of
the
preceding
night
crossing
the
next
morning
a
number
of
handsome
creeks
with
water
clear
and
sandy
beds
we
reached
at
a
very
beautiful
wooded
stream
about
feet
wide
called
sandy
creek
and
sometimes
as
the
ottoes
frequently
winter
there
the
otto
fork
the
country
has
become
very
sandy
and
the
plants
less
varied
and
abundant
with
the
exception
of
the
which
rivals
the
grass
in
quantity
though
not
so
forward
as
it
has
been
found
to
the
eastward
at
the
big
trees
where
we
had
intended
to
noon
no
water
was
to
be
found
the
bed
of
the
little
creek
was
perfectly
dry
and
on
the
adjacent
sandy
bottom
for
the
first
time
made
their
appearance
we
made
here
a
short
delay
in
search
of
water
and
after
a
hard
day
march
of
miles
encamped
at
on
the
little
blue
where
our
arrival
made
a
scene
of
the
arabian
desert
as
fast
as
they
arrived
men
and
horses
rushed
into
the
stream
where
they
bathed
and
drank
together
in
common
enjoyment
we
were
now
in
the
range
of
the
pawnees
who
were
accustomed
to
infest
this
part
of
the
country
stealing
horses
from
companies
on
their
way
to
the
mountains
and
when
in
sufficient
force
openly
attacking
and
plundering
them
and
subjecting
them
to
various
kinds
of
insult
for
the
first
time
therefore
guard
was
mounted
our
route
the
next
morning
lay
up
the
valley
which
bordered
by
hills
with
graceful
slopes
looked
uncommonly
green
and
beautiful
the
stream
was
about
fifty
feet
wide
and
three
or
four
deep
fringed
by
and
willow
with
frequent
groves
of
oak
tenanted
by
flocks
of
turkeys
game
here
too
made
its
appearance
in
greater
plenty
elk
were
frequently
seen
on
the
hills
and
now
and
then
an
antelope
bounded
across
our
path
or
a
deer
broke
from
the
groves
the
road
in
the
afternoon
was
over
the
upper
prairies
several
miles
from
the
river
and
we
encamped
at
sunset
on
one
of
its
small
tributaries
where
an
abundance
of
prele
afforded
fine
forage
to
our
tired
animals
we
had
traveled
miles
a
heavy
bank
of
black
clouds
in
the
west
came
on
us
in
a
storm
between
nine
and
ten
preceded
by
a
violent
wind
the
rain
fell
in
such
torrents
that
it
was
difficult
to
breathe
facing
the
wind
the
thunder
rolled
incessantly
and
the
whole
sky
was
tremulous
with
lightning
now
and
then
illuminated
by
a
blinding
flash
succeeded
by
pitchy
darkness
carson
had
the
watch
from
ten
to
midnight
and
to
him
had
been
assigned
our
young
de
brant
and
benton
this
was
their
first
night
on
guard
and
such
an
introduction
did
not
augur
very
auspiciously
of
the
pleasures
of
the
expedition
many
things
conspired
to
render
their
situation
uncomfortable
stories
of
desperate
and
bloody
indian
fights
were
rife
in
the
camp
our
position
was
badly
chosen
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
timbered
hollows
and
occupying
an
area
of
several
hundred
feet
so
that
necessarily
the
guards
were
far
apart
and
now
and
then
i
could
hear
randolph
as
if
relieved
by
the
sound
of
a
voice
in
the
darkness
calling
out
to
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
to
direct
his
attention
to
some
imaginary
alarm
but
they
stood
it
out
and
took
their
turn
regularly
afterwards
the
next
morning
we
had
a
specimen
of
the
false
alarms
to
which
all
parties
in
these
wild
regions
are
subject
proceeding
up
the
valley
objects
were
seen
on
the
opposite
hills
which
disappeared
before
a
glass
could
be
brought
to
bear
upon
them
a
man
who
was
a
short
distance
in
the
rear
came
springing
up
in
great
haste
shouting
indians
indians
he
had
been
near
enough
to
see
and
count
them
according
to
his
report
and
had
made
out
i
immediately
halted
arms
were
examined
and
put
in
order
the
usual
preparations
made
and
kit
carson
springing
upon
one
of
the
hunting
horses
crossed
the
river
and
galloped
off
into
the
opposite
prairies
to
obtain
some
certain
intelligence
of
their
movements
mounted
on
a
fine
horse
without
a
saddle
and
scouring
over
the
prairies
kit
was
one
of
the
finest
pictures
of
a
horseman
i
have
ever
seen
a
short
time
enabled
him
to
discover
that
the
indian
of
consisted
of
six
elk
who
had
been
gazing
curiously
at
our
caravan
as
it
passed
by
and
were
now
scampering
off
at
full
speed
this
was
our
first
alarm
and
its
excitement
broke
agreeably
on
the
monotony
of
the
day
at
our
noon
halt
the
men
were
exercised
at
a
target
and
in
the
evening
we
pitched
our
tents
at
a
pawnee
encampment
of
last
july
they
had
apparently
killed
buffalo
here
as
many
bones
were
lying
about
and
the
frames
where
the
hides
had
been
stretched
were
yet
standing
the
road
of
the
day
had
kept
the
valley
which
is
sometimes
rich
and
well
timbered
though
the
country
generally
is
sandy
mingled
with
the
usual
plants
a
thistle
had
for
the
last
day
or
two
made
its
appearance
and
along

our
march
had
been
miles
and
the
astronomical
observations
gave
us
a
chronometric
longitude
of
and
latitude
we
were
moving
forward
at
seven
in
the
morning
and
in
about
five
miles
reached
a
fork
of
the
blue
where
the
road
leaves
that
river
and
crosses
over
to
the
platte
no
water
was
to
be
found
on
the
dividing
ridge
and
the
casks
were
filled
and
the
animals
here
allowed
a
short
repose
the
road
led
across
a
high
and
level
prairie
ridge
where
were
but
few
plants
and
those
principally
thistle
and
a
kind
of
dwarf
artemisia
antelope
were
seen
frequently
during
the
morning
which
was
very
stormy
squalls
of
rain
with
thunder
and
lightning
were
around
us
in
every
direction
and
while
we
were
enveloped
in
one
of
them
a
flash
which
seemed
to
scorch
our
eyes
as
it
passed
struck
in
the
prairie
within
a
few
hundred
feet
sending
up
a
column
of
dust
crossing
on
the
way
several
pawnee
roads
to
the
arkansas
we
reached
in
about
miles
from
our
halt
on
the
blue
what
is
called
the
coast
of
the
nebraska
or
platte
river
this
had
seemed
in
the
distance
a
range
of
high
and
broken
hills
but
on
a
nearer
approach
was
found
to
be
elevations
of
forty
to
sixty
feet
into
which
the
wind
had
worked
the
sand
they
were
covered
with
the
usual
fine
grasses
of
the
country
and
bordered
the
eastern
side
of
the
ridge
on
a
breadth
of
about
two
miles

here
to
have
produced

numerous
and
all
the

of
the
region
appeared
to
flourish
among
the
warm
hills
among
them
the
in
full
bloom
was
remarkable
for
its
large
and
luxuriant
purple
clusters
from
the
foot
of
the
coast
a
distance
of
two
miles
across
the
level
bottom
brought
us
to
our
encampment
on
the
shore
of
the
river
about
twenty
miles
below
the
head
of
grand
island
which
lay
extended
before
us
covered
with
dense
and
heavy
woods
from
the
mouth
of
the
kansas
according
to
our
reckoning
we
had
traveled
three
hundred
and
miles
and
the
geological
formation
of
the
country
we
had
passed
over
consisted
of
lime
and
sand
stone
covered
by
the
same
erratic
deposits
of
sand
and
gravel
which
forms
the

of
the

between
the
missouri
and

rivers
except
in
some
occasional

met
with
no

the
elevation
of
the
platte
valley
above
the
sea
is
here
about
two
thousand
feet
the
astronomical
observations
of
the
night
placed
us
in
longitude
latitude
the
animals
were
somewhat
fatigued
by
their
march
of
yesterday
and
after
a
short
journey
of
eighteen
miles
along
the
river
bottom
i
encamped
near
the
head
of
grand
island
in
longitude
by
observation
latitude
the
soil
was
here
light
but
rich
though
in
some
places
rather
sandy
and
with
the
exception
of
scattered
fringe
along
the
bank
the
timber
consisting
principally
of
poplar
elm
and
hackberry
is
confined
almost
entirely
to
the
islands
we
halted
to
noon
at
an
open
reach
of
the
river
which
occupies
rather
more
than
a
fourth
of
the
valley
here
only
about
four
miles
broad
the
camp
had
been
disposed
with
the
usual
precaution
the
horses
grazing
at
a
little
distance
attended
by
the
guard
and
we
were
all
sitting
quietly
at
our
dinner
on
the
grass
when
suddenly
we
heard
the
startling
cry
du
monde
in
an
instant
every
man
weapon
was
in
his
hand
the
horses
were
driven
in
hobbled
and
picketed
and
horsemen
were
galloping
at
full
speed
in
the
direction
of
the
newcomers
screaming
and
yelling
with
the
wildest
excitement
get
ready
my
lads
said
the
leader
of
the
approaching
party
to
his
men
when
our
wild
looking
horsemen
were
discovered
bearing
down
upon
them
nous
allons
attraper
des
coups
de
baguette
they
proved
to
be
a
small
party
of
fourteen
under
the
charge
of
a
man
named
john
lee
and
with
their
baggage
and
provisions
strapped
to
their
backs
were
making
their
way
on
foot
to
the
frontier
a
brief
account
of
their
fortunes
will
give
some
idea
of
navigation
in
the
nebraska
sixty
days
since
they
had
left
the
mouth
of
laramie
fork
some
three
hundred
miles
above
in
barges
laden
with
the
furs
of
the
american
fur
company
they
started
with
the
annual
flood
and
drawing
but
nine
inches
water
hoped
to
make
a
speedy
and
prosperous
voyage
to
louis
but
after
a
lapse
of
forty
days
found
themselves
only
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles
from
their
point
of
departure
they
came
down
rapidly
as
far
as
bluffs
where
their
difficulties
began
sometimes
they
came
upon
places
where
the
water
was
spread
over
a
great
extent
and
here
they
toiled
from
morning
until
night
endeavoring
to
drag
their
boat
through
the
sands
making
only
two
or
three
miles
in
as
many
days
sometimes
they
would
enter
an
arm
of
the
river
where
there
appeared
a
fine
channel
and
after
descending
prosperously
for
eight
or
ten
miles
would
come
suddenly
upon
dry
sands
and
be
compelled
to
return
dragging
their
boat
for
days
against
the
rapid
current
and
at
others
they
came
upon
places
where
the
water
lay
in
holes
and
getting
out
to
float
off
their
boat
would
fall
into
water
up
to
their
necks
and
the
next
moment
tumble
over
against
a
sandbar
discouraged
at
length
and
finding
the
platte
growing
every
day
more
shallow
they
discharged
the
principal
part
of
their
cargoes
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles
below
fort
laramie
which
they
secured
as
well
as
possible
and
leaving
a
few
men
to
guard
them
attempted
to
continue
their
voyage
laden
with
some
light
furs
and
their
personal
baggage
after
fifteen
or
twenty
days
more
struggling
in
the
sands
during
which
they
made
but
one
hundred
and
forty
miles
they
sunk
their
barges
made
a
of
their
remaining
furs
and
property
in
trees
on
the
bank
and
packing
on
his
back
what
each
man
could
carry
had
commenced
the
day
before
we
encountered
them
their
journey
on
foot
to
louis
we
laughed
then
at
their
forlorn
and
vagabond
appearance
and
in
our
turn
a
month
or
two
afterwards
furnished
the
same
occasion
for
merriment
to
others
even
their
stock
of
tobacco
that
qua
of
a
voyageur
without
which
the
night
fire
is
gloomy
was
entirely
exhausted
however
we
shortened
their
homeward
journey
by
a
small
supply
from
our
own
provision
they
gave
us
the
welcome
intelligence
that
the
buffalo
were
abundant
some
two
days
march
in
advance
and
made
us
a
present
of
some
choice
pieces
which
were
a
very
acceptable
change
from
our
salt
pork
in
the
interchange
of
news
and
the
renewal
of
old
acquaintanceships
we
found
wherewithal
to
fill
a
busy
hour
then
we
mounted
our
horses
and
they
shouldered
their
packs
and
we
shook
hands
and
parted
among
them
i
had
found
an
old
companion
on
the
northern
prairie
a
hardened
and
hardly
served
veteran
of
the
mountains
who
had
been
as
much
hacked
and
scarred
as
an
old
moustache
of
napoleon
old
guard
he
flourished
in
the
sobriquet
of
la
tulipe
and
his
real
name
i
never
knew
finding
that
he
was
going
to
the
states
only
because
his
company
was
bound
in
that
direction
and
that
he
was
rather
more
willing
to
return
with
me
i
took
him
again
into
my
service
we
traveled
this
day
but
seventeen
miles
at
our
evening
camp
about
sunset
three
figures
were
discovered
approaching
which
our
glasses
made
out
to
be
indians
they
proved
to
be
cheyennes
two
men
and
a
boy
of
thirteen
about
a
month
since
they
had
left
their
people
on
the
south
fork
of
the
river
some
three
hundred
miles
to
the
westward
and
a
party
of
only
four
in
number
had
been
to
the
pawnee
villages
on
a
excursion
from
which
they
were
returning
unsuccessful
they
were
miserably
mounted
on
wild
horses
from
the
arkansas
plains
and
had
no
other
weapons
than
bows
and
long
spears
and
had
they
been
discovered
by
the
pawnees
could
not
by
any
possibility
have
escaped
they
were
mortified
by
their
and
said
the
pawnees
were
cowards
who
shut
up
their
horses
in
their
lodges
at
night
i
invited
them
to
supper
with
me
and
randolph
and
the
young
cheyenne
who
had
been
eyeing
each
other
suspiciously
and
curiously
soon
became
intimate
friends
after
supper
we
sat
down
on
the
grass
and
i
placed
a
sheet
of
paper
between
us
on
which
they
traced
rudely
but
with
a
certain
degree
of
relative
truth
the
of
the
country
which
lay
between
us
and
their
villages
and
of
which
i
desired
to
have
some
information
their
companions
they
told
us
had
taken
a
nearer
route
over
the
hills
but
they
had
mounted
one
of
the
summits
to
spy
out
the
country
whence
they
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
our
party
and
confident
of
good
treatment
at
the
hands
of
the
whites
hastened
to
join
company
latitude
of
the
camp
we
made
the
next
morning
sixteen
miles
i
remarked
that
the
ground
was
covered
in
many
places
with
an
efflorescence
of
salt
and
the
plants
were
not
numerous
in
the
bottoms
were
frequently
seen
tradescantia
and
on
the
dry
lenches
were
carduus
cactus
and
amorpha
a
high
wind
during
the
morning
had
increased
to
a
violent
gale
from
the
northwest
which
made
our
afternoon
ride
cold
and
unpleasant
we
had
the
welcome
sight
of
two
buffaloes
on
one
of
the
large
islands
and
encamped
at
a
clump
of
timber
about
seven
miles
from
our
noon
halt
after
a
march
of
miles
the
air
was
keen
the
next
morning
at
sunrise
the
thermometer
standing
at
and
it
was
sufficiently
cold
to
make
overcoats
very
comfortable
a
few
miles
brought
us
into
the
midst
of
the
buffalo
swarming
in
immense
numbers
over
the
plains
where
they
had
left
scarcely
a
blade
of
grass
standing
preuss
who
was
sketching
at
a
little
distance
in
the
rear
had
at
first
noted
them
as
large
groves
of
timber
in
the
sight
of
such
a
mass
of
life
the
traveler
feels
a
strange
emotion
of
grandeur
we
had
heard
from
a
distance
a
dull
and
confused
murmuring
and
when
we
came
in
view
of
their
dark
masses
there
was
not
one
among
us
who
did
not
feel
his
heart
beat
quicker
it
was
the
early
part
of
the
day
when
the
herds
are
feeding
and
everywhere
they
were
in
motion
here
and
there
a
huge
old
bull
was
rolling
in
the
grass
and
clouds
of
dust
rose
in
the
air
from
various
parts
of
the
bands
each
the
scene
of
some
obstinate
fight
indians
and
buffalo
make
the
poetry
and
life
of
the
prairie
and
our
camp
was
full
of
their
exhilaration
in
place
of
the
quiet
monotony
of
the
march
relieved
only
by
the
cracking
of
the
whip
and
an
avance
donc
enfant
de
garce
shouts
and
songs
resounded
from
every
part
of
the
line
and
our
evening
camp
was
always
the
commencement
of
a
feast
which
terminated
only
with
our
departure
on
the
following
morning
at
any
time
of
the
night
might
be
seen
pieces
of
the
most
delicate
and
choicest
meat
roasting
on
sticks
around
the
fire
and
the
guard
were
never
without
company
with
pleasant
weather
and
no
enemy
to
fear
an
abundance
of
the
most
excellent
meat
and
no
scarcity
of
bread
or
tobacco
they
were
enjoying
the
oasis
of
a
voyageur
life
three
cows
were
killed
kit
carson
had
shot
one
and
was
continuing
the
chase
in
the
midst
of
another
herd
when
his
horse
fell
headlong
but
sprang
up
and
joined
the
flying
band
though
considerably
hurt
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
break
no
bones
and
maxwell
who
was
mounted
on
a
fleet
hunter
captured
the
runaway
after
a
hard
chase
he
was
on
the
point
of
shooting
him
to
avoid
the
loss
of
his
bridle
a
handsomely
mounted
spanish
one
when
he
found
that
his
horse
was
able
to
come
up
with
him
animals
are
frequently
lost
in
this
way
and
it
is
necessary
to
keep
close
watch
over
them
in
the
vicinity
of
the
buffalo
in
the
midst
of
which
they
scour
off
to
the
plains
and
are
rarely
retaken
one
of
our
mules
took
a
sudden
freak
into
his
head
and
joined
a
neighboring
band
as
we
were
not
in
a
condition
to
lose
horses
i
sent
several
men
in
pursuit
and
remained
in
camp
in
the
hope
of
recovering
him
but
lost
the
afternoon
to
no
purpose
as
we
did
not
see
him
again
astronomical
observations
placed
us
in
longitude
latitude
july
along
our
road
the
prairie
bottom
was
more
elevated
and
dry
and
the
river
hills
which
border
the
right
side
of
the
river
higher
and
more
broken
and
picturesque
in
the
outline
the
country
too
was
better
timbered
as
we
were
riding
quietly
along
the
bank
a
grand
herd
of
buffalo
some
seven
or
eight
hundred
in
number
came
crowding
up
from
the
river
where
they
had
been
to
drink
and
commenced
crossing
the
plain
slowly
eating
as
they
went
the
wind
was
favorable
the
coolness
of
the
morning
invited
to
exercise
the
ground
was
apparently
good
and
the
distance
across
the
prairie
two
or
three
miles
gave
us
a
fine
opportunity
to
charge
them
before
they
could
get
among
the
river
hills
it
was
too
fine
a
prospect
for
a
chase
to
be
lost
and
halting
for
a
few
moments
the
hunters
were
brought
up
and
saddled
and
kit
carson
maxwell
and
i
started
together
they
were
now
somewhat
less
than
half
a
mile
distant
and
we
rode
easily
along
until
within
about
three
hundred
yards
when
a
sudden
agitation
a
wavering
in
the
band
and
a
galloping
to
and
fro
of
some
which
were
scattered
along
the
skirts
gave
us
the
intimation
that
we
were
discovered
we
started
together
at
a
hand
gallop
riding
steadily
abreast
of
each
other
and
here
the
interest
of
the
chase
became
so
engrossingly
intense
that
we
were
sensible
to
nothing
else
we
were
now
closing
upon
them
rapidly
and
the
front
of
the
mass
was
already
in
rapid
motion
for
the
hills
and
in
a
few
seconds
the
movement
had
communicated
itself
to
the
whole
herd
a
crowd
of
bulls
as
usual
brought
up
the
rear
and
every
now
and
then
some
of
them
faced
about
and
then
dashed
on
after
the
band
a
short
distance
and
turned
and
looked
again
as
if
more
than
half
inclined
to
fight
in
a
few
moments
however
during
which
we
had
been
quickening
our
pace
the
rout
was
universal
and
we
were
going
over
the
ground
like
a
hurricane
when
at
about
thirty
yards
we
gave
the
usual
shout
the
hunter
de
and
broke
into
the
herd
we
entered
on
the
side
the
mass
giving
way
in
every
direction
in
their
heedless
course
many
of
the
bulls
less
active
and
fleet
than
the
cows
paying
no
attention
to
the
ground
and
occupied
solely
with
the
hunter
were
precipitated
to
the
earth
with
great
force
rolling
over
and
over
with
the
violence
of
the
shock
and
hardly
distinguishable
in
the
dust
we
separated
on
entering
each
singling
out
his
game
my
horse
was
a
trained
hunter
famous
in
the
west
under
the
name
of
proveau
and
with
his
eyes
flashing
and
the
foam
flying
from
his
mouth
sprang
on
after
the
cow
like
a
tiger
in
a
few
moments
he
brought
me
alongside
of
her
and
rising
in
the
stirrups
i
fired
at
the
distance
of
a
yard
the
ball
entering
at
the
termination
of
the
long
hair
and
passing
near
the
heart
she
fell
headlong
at
the
report
of
the
gun
and
checking
my
horse
i
looked
around
for
my
companions
at
a
little
distance
kit
was
on
the
ground
engaged
in
tying
his
horse
to
the
horns
of
a
cow
he
was
preparing
to
cut
up
among
the
scattered
bands
at
some
distance
below
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
maxwell
and
while
i
was
looking
a
light
wreath
of
smoke
curled
away
from
his
gun
from
which
i
was
too
far
to
hear
the
report
nearer
and
between
me
and
the
hills
towards
which
they
were
directing
their
course
was
the
body
of
the
herd
and
giving
my
horse
the
rein
we
dashed
after
them
a
thick
cloud
of
dust
hung
upon
their
rear
which
filled
my
mouth
and
eyes
and
nearly
smothered
me
in
the
midst
of
this
i
could
see
nothing
and
the
buffalo
were
not
distinguishable
until
within
thirty
feet
they
crowded
together
more
densely
still
as
i
came
upon
them
and
rushed
along
in
such
a
compact
body
that
i
could
not
obtain
an
entrance
the
horse
almost
leaping
upon
them
in
a
few
moments
the
mass
divided
to
the
right
and
left
the
horns
clattering
with
a
noise
heard
above
every
thing
else
and
my
horse
darted
into
the
opening
five
or
six
bulls
charged
on
us
as
we
dashed
along
the
line
but
were
left
far
behind
and
singling
out
a
cow
i
gave
her
my
fire
but
struck
too
high
she
gave
a
tremendous
leap
and
scoured
on
swifter
than
before
i
reined
up
my
horse
and
the
band
swept
on
like
a
torrent
and
left
the
place
quiet
and
clear
our
chase
had
led
us
into
dangerous
ground
a
village
so
thickly
settled
that
there
were
three
or
four
holes
in
every
twenty
yards
square
occupied
the
whole
bottom
for
nearly
two
miles
in
length
looking
around
i
saw
only
one
of
the
hunters
nearly
out
of
sight
and
the
long
dark
line
of
our
caravan
crawling
along
three
or
four
miles
distant
after
a
march
of
miles
we
encamped
at
nightfall
one
mile
and
a
half
above
the
lower
end
of
brady
island
the
breadth
of
this
arm
of
the
river
was
eight
hundred
and
eighty
yards
and
the
water
nowhere
two
feet
in
depth
the
island
bears
the
name
of
a
man
killed
on
this
spot
some
years
ago
his
party
had
encamped
here
three
in
company
and
one
of
the
number
went
off
to
hunt
leaving
brady
and
his
companion
together
these
two
had
frequently
quarreled
and
on
the
hunter
return
he
found
brady
dead
and
was
told
that
he
had
shot
himself
accidentally
he
was
buried
here
on
the
bank
but
as
usual
the
wolves
tore
him
out
and
some
human
bones
that
were
lying
on
the
ground
we
supposed
were
his
troops
of
wolves
that
were
hanging
on
the
skirts
of
the
buffalo
kept
up
an
uninterrupted
howling
during
the
night
venturing
almost
into
camp
in
the
morning
they
were
sitting
at
a
short
distance
barking
and
impatiently
waiting
our
departure
to
fall
upon
the
bones
the
morning
was
cool
and
smoky
our
road
led
closer
to
the
hills
which
here
increased
in
elevation
presenting
an
outline
of
conical
peaks
three
hundred
to
five
hundred
feet
high
some
timber
apparently
pine
grows
in
the
ravines
and
streaks
of
clay
or
sand
whiten
their
slopes
we
crossed
during
the
morning
a
number
of
hollows
timbered
principally
with
box
elder
poplar
and
elm
island
is
well
wooded
and
all
the
river
along
which
our
road
led
may
in
general
be
called
tolerably
well
timbered
we
passed
near
the
encampment
of
the
oregon
emigrants
where
they
appeared
to
have
reposed
several
days
a
variety
of
household
articles
were
scattered
about
and
they
had
probably
disburdened
themselves
here
of
many
things
not
absolutely
necessary
i
had
left
the
usual
road
before
the
halt
and
in
the
afternoon
having
sent
several
men
in
advance
to
reconnoitre
marched
directly
for
the
mouth
of
the
south
fork
on
our
arrival
the
horsemen
were
sent
in
and
scattered
about
the
river
to
search
for
the
best
and
the
carts
followed
immediately
the
stream
is
here
divided
by
an
island
into
two
channels
the
southern
is
four
hundred
and
fifty
feet
wide
having
eighteen
or
twenty
inches
water
in
the
deepest
places
with
the
exception
of
a
few
dry
bars
the
bed
of
the
river
is
generally
quicksands
in
which
the
carts
began
to
sink
rapidly
so
soon
as
the
mules
halted
so
that
it
was
necessary
to
keep
them
constantly
in
motion
the
northern
channel
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
wide
was
somewhat
deeper
having
frequently
three
feet
water
in
the
numerous
small
channels
with
a
bed
of
coarse
gravel
the
whole
breadth
of
the
nebraska
immediately
below
the
junction
is
five
thousand
three
hundred
and
fifty
feet
all
our
equipage
had
reached
the
left
bank
safely
at
six
having
made
twenty
miles
we
encamped
at
the
point
of
land
immediately
at
the
junction
of
the
north
and
south
forks
between
the
streams
is
a
low
rich
prairie
extending
from
their
confluence
eighteen
miles
westwardly
to
the
bordering
hills
where
it
is
five
and
a
half
miles
wide
it
is
covered
with
a
luxuriant
growth
of
grass
and
along
the
banks
is
a
slight
and
scattered
fringe
of
cottonwood
and
willow
in
the
and
wallows
i
remarked
saline
efflorescences
to
which
a
rapid
evaporation
in
the
great
heat
of
the
sun
probably
contributes
as
the
soil
is
entirely
unprotected
by
timber
in
the
vicinity
of
these
places
there
was
a
bluish
grass
which
the
cattle
refuse
to
eat
called
by
the
voyageurs
herbe
salée
salt
grass
the
latitude
of
the
junction
is
and
longitude
by
chronometer
and
lunar
distances
the
elevation
above
the
sea
is
about
two
thousand
seven
hundred
feet
the
hunters
came
in
with
a
fat
cow
and
as
we
had
labored
hard
we
enjoyed
well
a
supper
of
roasted
ribs
and
boudins
the
chef
of
a
prairie
cook
mosquitoes
thronged
about
us
this
evening
but
by
ten
when
the
thermometer
had
fallen
to
they
had
all
disappeared
as
this
was
to
be
a
point
in
our
homeward
journey
i
made
a
cache
a
term
used
in
all
this
country
for
what
is
hidden
in
the
ground
of
a
barrel
of
pork
it
was
impossible
to
conceal
such
a
proceeding
from
the
sharp
eyes
of
our
cheyenne
companions
and
i
therefore
told
them
to
go
and
see
what
it
was
they
were
burying
they
would
otherwise
have
not
failed
to
return
and
destroy
our
cache
in
expectation
of
some
rich
booty
but
pork
they
dislike
and
never
eat
we
left
our
camp
at
nine
continuing
up
the
south
fork
the
affording
us
a
fair
road
but
in
the
long
grass
we
roused
myriads
of
mosquitoes
and
flies
from
which
our
horses
suffered
severely
the
day
was
smoky
with
a
pleasant
breeze
from
the
south
and
the
plains
on
the
opposite
side
were
covered
with
buffalo
having
traveled
miles
we
encamped
at
six
in
the
evening
and
the
men
were
sent
across
the
river
for
wood
as
there
is
none
here
on
the
left
bank
our
fires
were
partially
made
of
the
de
the
dry
excrement
of
the
buffalo
which
like
that
of
the
camel
in
the
arabian
deserts
furnishes
to
the
traveler
a
very
good
substitute
for
wood
burning
like
turf
wolves
in
great
numbers
surrounded
us
during
the
night
crossing
and
recrossing
from
the
opposite
herds
to
our
camp
and
howling
and
trotting
about
in
the
river
until
morning
the
morning
was
very
smoky
the
sun
shining
dimly
and
red
as
in
thick
fog
the
camp
was
roused
by
a
salute
at
daybreak
and
from
our
scanty
store
a
portion
of
what
our
indian
friends
called
the
red
served
out
to
the
men
while
we
were
at
breakfast
a
broke
through
the
camp
followed
by
a
couple
of
wolves
in
its
fright
it
had
probably
mistaken
us
for
a
band
of
buffalo
the
wolves
were
obliged
to
make
a
circuit
round
the
camp
so
that
the
calf
got
a
little
the
start
and
strained
every
nerve
to
reach
a
large
herd
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
about
two
miles
distant
but
first
one
and
then
another
and
another
wolf
joined
in
the
chase
until
his
pursuers
amounted
to
twenty
or
thirty
and
they
ran
him
down
before
he
could
reach
his
friends
there
were
a
few
bulls
near
the
place
and
one
of
them
attacked
the
wolves
and
tried
to
rescue
him
but
was
driven
off
immediately
and
the
little
animal
fell
an
easy
prey
half
devoured
before
he
was
dead
we
watched
the
chase
with
the
interest
always
felt
for
the
weak
and
had
there
been
a
saddled
horse
at
hand
he
would
have
fared
better
leaving
camp
our
road
soon
approached
the
hills
in
which
strata
of
a
marl
like
that
of
the
chimney
rock
hereafter
described
made
their
appearance
it
is
probably
of
this
rock
that
the
hills
on
the
right
bank
of
the
platte
a
little
below
the
junction
are
composed
and
which
are
worked
by
the
winds
and
rains
into
sharp
peaks
and
cones
giving
them
in
contrast
to
the
surrounding
level
region
something
of
a
picturesque
appearance
we
crossed
this
morning
numerous
beds
of
the
small
creeks
which
in
the
time
of
rains
and
melting
snow
pour
down
from
the
ridge
bringing
down
with
them
always
great
quantities
of
sand
and
gravel
which
have
gradually
raised
their
beds
four
to
ten
feet
above
the
level
of
the
prairie
which
they
cross
making
each
one
of
them
a
miniature
po
raised
in
this
way
above
the
surrounding
prairie
without
any
bank
the
long
yellow
and
winding
line
of
their
beds
resembles
a
causeway
from
the
hills
to
the
river
many
spots
on
the
prairie
are
yellow
with
sunflower
as
we
were
riding
slowly
along
this
afternoon
clouds
of
dust
in
the
ravines
among
the
hills
to
the
right
suddenly
attracted
our
attention
and
in
a
few
minutes
column
after
column
of
buffalo
came
galloping
down
making
directly
to
the
river
by
the
time
the
leading
herds
had
reached
the
water
the
prairie
was
darkened
with
the
dense
masses
immediately
before
us
when
the
bands
first
came
down
into
the
valley
stretched
an
unbroken
line
the
head
of
which
was
lost
among
the
river
hills
on
the
opposite
side
and
still
they
poured
down
from
the
ridge
on
our
right
from
hill
to
hill
the
prairie
bottom
was
certainly
not
less
than
two
miles
wide
and
allowing
the
animals
to
be
ten
feet
apart
and
only
ten
in
a
line
there
were
already
eleven
thousand
in
view
some
idea
may
thus
be
formed
of
their
number
when
they
had
occupied
the
whole
plain
in
a
short
time
they
surrounded
us
on
every
side
extending
for
several
miles
in
the
rear
and
forward
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
leaving
around
us
as
we
advanced
an
open
space
of
only
two
or
three
hundred
yards
this
movement
of
the
buffalo
indicated
to
us
the
presence
of
indians
on
the
north
fork
i
halted
earlier
than
usual
about
forty
miles
from
the
junction
and
all
hands
were
soon
busily
engaged
in
preparing
a
feast
to
celebrate
the
day
the
kindness
of
our
friends
at
louis
had
provided
us
with
a
large
supply
of
excellent
preserves
and
rich
and
when
these
were
added
to
a
macaroni
soup
and
variously
prepared
dishes
of
the
choicest
crowned
with
a
cup
of
coffee
and
enjoyed
with
prairie
appetite
we
felt
as
we
sat
in
barbaric
luxury
around
our
smoking
supper
on
the
grass
a
greater
sensation
of
enjoyment
than
the
roman
epicure
at
his
perfumed
feast
but
most
of
all
it
seemed
to
please
our
indian
friends
who
in
the
unrestrained
enjoyment
of
the
moment
demanded
to
know
if
our
came
often
no
restraint
was
exercised
at
the
hospitable
board
and
to
the
great
delight
of
his
elders
our
young
indian
lad
made
himself
extremely
drunk
our
encampment
was
within
a
few
miles
of
the
place
where
the
road
crosses
to
the
north
fork
and
various
reasons
led
me
to
divide
my
party
at
this
point
the
north
fork
was
the
principal
object
of
my
survey
but
i
was
desirous
to
ascend
the
south
branch
with
a
view
of
obtaining
some
astronomical
positions
and
determining
the
mouths
of
its
tributaries
as
far
as
vrain
fort
estimated
to
be
some
two
hundred
miles
farther
up
the
river
and
near
to
long
peak
there
i
hoped
to
obtain
some
mules
which
i
found
would
be
necessary
to
relieve
my
horses
in
a
military
point
of
view
i
was
desirous
to
form
some
opinion
of
the
country
relative
to
the
establishment
of
posts
on
a
line
connecting
the
settlements
with
the
south
pass
of
the
rocky
mountains
by
way
of
the
arkansas
and
the
south
and
laramie
forks
of
the
platte
crossing
the
country
northwestwardly
from
vrain
fort
to
the
american
company
fort
at
the
mouth
of
the
laramie
would
give
me
some
acquaintance
with
the
affluents
which
the
mountain
between
the
two
i
therefore
determined
to
set
out
the
next
morning
accompanied
by
four
men
maxwell
bernier
ayot
and
basil
lajeunesse
our
cheyennes
whose
village
lay
up
this
river
also
decided
to
accompany
us
the
party
i
left
in
charge
of
clement
lambert
with
orders
to
cross
to
the
north
fork
and
at
some
convenient
place
near
to
the
des
make
a
cache
of
every
thing
not
absolutely
necessary
to
the
further
progress
of
our
expedition
from
this
point
using
the
most
guarded
precaution
in
his
march
through
the
country
he
was
to
proceed
to
the
american
company
fort
at
the
mouth
of
the
laramie
fork
and
await
my
arrival
which
would
be
prior
to
the
as
on
that
and
the
following
night
would
occur
some
occultations
which
i
was
desirous
to
obtain
at
that
place
before
breakfast
all
was
ready
we
had
one
led
horse
in
addition
to
those
we
rode
and
a
destined
to
carry
our
instruments
provisions
and
baggage
the
last
two
articles
not
being
of
great
weight
the
instruments
consisted
of
a
sextant
artificial
horizon
a
barometer
and
compass
the
chronometer
i
of
course
kept
on
my
person
i
had
ordered
the
cook
to
put
up
for
us
some
flour
coffee
and
sugar
and
our
rifles
were
to
furnish
the
rest
one
blanket
in
addition
to
his
saddle
and
saddle
blanket
furnished
the
materials
for
each
man
bed
and
every
one
was
provided
with
a
change
of
linen
all
were
armed
with
rifles
or
guns
and
in
addition
to
these
maxwell
and
myself
were
furnished
with
excellent
pistols
thus
accoutred
we
took
a
parting
breakfast
with
our
friends
and
set
forth
our
journey
the
first
day
afforded
nothing
of
any
interest
we
shot
a
buffalo
towards
sunset
and
having
obtained
some
meat
for
our
evening
meal
encamped
where
a
little
timber
afforded
us
the
means
of
making
a
fire
having
disposed
our
meat
on
we
proceeded
to
unpack
our
bales
in
search
of
coffee
and
sugar
and
flour
for
bread
with
the
exception
of
a
little
parched
coffee
unground
we
found
nothing
our
cook
had
neglected
to
put
it
up
or
it
had
been
somehow
forgotten
tired
and
hungry
with
tough
without
salt
for
we
had
not
been
able
to
kill
a
cow
and
a
little
bitter
coffee
we
sat
down
in
silence
to
our
miserable
fare
a
very
disconsolate
party
for
yesterday
feast
was
yet
fresh
in
our
memories
and
this
was
our
first
brush
with
misfortune
each
man
took
his
blanket
and
laid
himself
down
silently
for
the
worst
part
of
these
mishaps
is
that
they
make
people
we
had
traveled
about
miles
finding
that
our
present
excursion
would
be
attended
with
considerable
hardship
and
unwilling
to
expose
more
persons
than
necessary
i
determined
to
send
preuss
back
to
the
party
his
horse
too
appeared
in
no
condition
to
support
the
journey
and
accordingly
after
breakfast
he
took
the
road
across
the
hills
attended
by
one
of
my
most
trusty
men
bernier
the
ridge
between
the
rivers
is
here
about
fifteen
miles
broad
and
i
expected
he
would
probably
strike
the
fork
near
their
evening
camp
at
all
events
he
would
not
fail
to
find
their
trail
and
rejoin
them
the
next
day
we
continued
our
journey
seven
in
number
including
the
three
cheyennes
our
general
course
was
southwest
up
the
valley
of
the
river
which
was
sandy
bordered
on
the
northern
side
of
the
valley
by
a
low
ridge
and
on
the
south
after
seven
or
eight
miles
the
river
hills
became
higher
six
miles
from
our
we
crossed
the
bed
of
a
considerable
stream
now
entirely
dry
a
bed
of
sand
in
a
grove
of
willows
near
the
mouth
were
the
remains
of
a
considerable
fort
constructed
of
trunks
of
large
trees
it
was
apparently
very
old
and
had
probably
been
the
scene
of
some
hostile
encounter
among
the
roving
tribes
its
solitude
formed
an
impressive
contrast
to
the
picture
which
our
imaginations
involuntarily
drew
of
the
busy
scene
which
had
been
enacted
here
the
timber
appeared
to
have
been
much
more
extensive
formerly
than
now
there
were
but
few
trees
a
kind
of
willow
standing
and
numerous
trunks
of
large
trees
were
scattered
about
on
the
ground
in
many
similar
places
i
had
occasion
to
remark
an
apparent
progressive
decay
in
the
timber
ten
miles
farther
we
reached
the
mouth
of
lodge
pole
creek
a
clear
and
handsome
stream
running
through
a
broad
valley
in
its
course
through
the
bottom
it
has
a
uniform
breadth
of
feet
and
six
inches
in
depth
a
few
willows
on
the
banks
strike
pleasantly
on
the
eye
by
their
greenness
in
the
midst
of
hot
and
barren
sands
the
was
frequent
among
the
ravines
but
the
sunflower
was
the
characteristic
and
flowers
of
deep
warm
colors
seem
most
to
love
the
sandy
soil
the
impression
of
the
country
traveled
over
was
one
of
dry
and
barren
sands
we
turned
in
towards
the
river
at
noon
and
gave
our
horses
two
hours
for
food
and
rest
i
had
no
other
thermometer
than
the
one
attached
to
the
barometer
which
stood
at
the
height
of
the
column
in
the
barometer
being
at
meridian
the
sky
was
clear
with
a
high
wind
from
the
south
at
we
continued
our
journey
the
wind
had
moderated
and
it
became
almost
unendurably
hot
and
our
animals
suffered
severely
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
the
wind
rose
suddenly
and
blew
hard
from
the
southwest
with
thunder
and
lightning
and
squalls
of
rain
these
were
blown
against
us
with
violence
by
the
wind
and
halting
we
turned
our
backs
to
the
storm
until
it
blew
over
antelope
were
tolerably
frequent
with
a
large
gray
hare
but
the
former
were
shy
and
the
latter
hardly
worth
the
delay
of
stopping
to
shoot
them
so
as
the
evening
drew
near
we
again
had
recourse
to
an
old
bull
and
encamped
at
sunset
on
an
island
in
the
platte
we
ate
our
meat
with
a
good
relish
this
evening
for
we
were
all
in
fine
health
and
had
ridden
nearly
all
of
a
long
summer
day
with
a
burning
sun
reflected
from
the
sands
my
companions
slept
rolled
up
in
their
blankets
and
the
indians
lay
in
the
grass
near
the
fire
but
my
generally
had
an
air
of
more
pretension
our
rifles
were
tied
together
near
the
muzzle
the
butts
resting
on
the
ground
and
a
knife
laid
on
the
rope
to
cut
away
in
case
of
an
alarm
over
this
which
made
a
kind
of
frame
was
thrown
a
large
cloth
which
we
used
to
cover
our
packs
this
made
a
tent
sufficiently
large
to
receive
about
half
of
my
bed
and
was
a
place
of
shelter
for
my
instruments
and
as
i
was
careful
always
to
put
this
part
against
the
wind
i
could
lie
here
with
a
sensation
of
satisfied
enjoyment
and
hear
the
wind
blow
and
the
rain
patter
close
to
my
head
and
know
that
i
should
be
at
least
half
dry
certainly
i
never
slept
more
soundly
the
barometer
at
sunset
was
thermometer
at
and
cloudy
but
a
gale
from
the
west
sprang
up
with
the
setting
sun
and
in
a
few
minutes
swept
away
every
cloud
from
the
sky
the
evening
was
very
fine
and
i
remained
up
to
take
astronomical
observations
which
made
our
position
in
latitude
and
longitude
at
our
camp
this
morning
at
six
the
barometer
was
at
thermometer
and
clear
with
a
light
wind
from
the
southwest
the
past
night
had
been
squally
with
high
winds
and
occasionally
a
few
drops
of
rain
our
cooking
did
not
occupy
much
time
and
we
left
camp
early
nothing
of
interest
occurred
during
the
morning
the
same
dreary
barrenness
except
that
a
hard
marly
clay
had
replaced
the
sandy
soil
buffalo
absolutely
covered
the
plain
on
both
sides
of
the
river
and
whenever
we
ascended
the
hills
scattered
herds
gave
life
to
the
view
in
every
direction
a
small
drove
of
wild
horses
made
their
appearance
on
the
low
river
bottoms
a
mile
or
two
to
the
left
and
i
sent
off
one
of
the
indians
who
seemed
very
eager
to
catch
one
on
my
led
horse
a
spirited
and
fleet
animal
the
savage
manoeuvred
a
little
to
get
the
wind
of
the
horses
in
which
he
succeeded
approaching
within
a
hundred
yards
without
being
discovered
the
chase
for
a
few
minutes
was
interesting
my
hunter
easily
overtook
and
passed
the
hindmost
of
the
wild
drove
which
the
did
not
attempt
to
all
his
efforts
being
directed
to
capture
the
leader
but
the
strength
of
the
horse
weakened
by
insufficient
nourishment
of
grass
failed
in
a
race
and
all
the
drove
escaped
we
halted
at
noon
on
the
bank
of
the
river
the
barometer
at
that
time
being
and
thermometer
with
a
light
air
from
the
south
and
clear
weather
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
dust
rising
among
the
hills
at
a
particular
place
attracted
our
attention
and
riding
up
we
found
a
band
of
eighteen
or
twenty
buffalo
bulls
engaged
in
a
desperate
fight
though
butting
and
goring
were
bestowed
liberally
and
without
distinction
yet
their
efforts
were
evidently
directed
against
one
a
huge
gaunt
old
bull
very
lean
while
his
adversaries
were
all
fat
and
in
good
order
he
appeared
very
weak
and
had
already
received
some
wounds
and
while
we
were
looking
on
was
several
times
knocked
down
and
badly
hurt
and
a
very
few
moments
would
have
put
an
end
to
him
of
course
we
took
the
side
of
the
weaker
party
and
attacked
the
herd
but
they
were
so
blind
with
rage
that
they
fought
on
utterly
regardless
of
our
presence
although
on
foot
and
on
horseback
we
were
firing
in
open
view
within
twenty
yards
of
them
but
this
did
not
last
long
in
a
very
few
seconds
we
created
a
commotion
among
them
one
or
two
which
were
knocked
over
by
the
balls
jumped
up
and
ran
off
into
the
hills
and
they
began
to
retreat
slowly
along
a
broad
ravine
to
the
river
fighting
furiously
as
they
went
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
bottom
we
had
pretty
well
dispersed
them
and
the
old
bull
hobbled
off
to
lie
down
somewhere
one
of
his
enemies
remained
on
the
ground
where
we
had
first
fired
upon
them
and
we
stopped
there
for
a
short
time
to
cut
from
him
some
meat
for
our
supper
we
had
neglected
to
secure
our
horses
thinking
it
an
unnecessary
precaution
in
their
fatigued
condition
but
our
mule
took
it
into
his
head
to
start
and
away
he
went
followed
at
full
speed
by
the
with
all
the
baggage
and
instruments
on
his
back
they
were
recovered
and
brought
back
after
a
chase
of
a
mile
fortunately
everything
was
well
secured
so
that
nothing
not
even
the
barometer
was
in
the
least
injured
the
sun
was
getting
low
and
some
narrow
lines
of
timber
four
or
five
miles
distant
promised
us
a
pleasant
camp
where
with
plenty
of
wood
for
fire
and
comfortable
shelter
and
rich
grass
for
our
animals
we
should
find
clear
cool
springs
instead
of
the
warm
water
of
the
platte
on
our
arrival
we
found
the
bed
of
a
stream
fifty
to
one
hundred
feet
wide
sunk
some
thirty
feet
below
the
level
of
the
prairie
with
perpendicular
banks
bordered
by
a
fringe
of
green
cottonwood
but
not
a
drop
of
water
there
were
several
small
forks
to
the
stream
all
in
the
same
condition
with
the
exception
of
the
platte
bottom
the
country
seemed
to
be
of
a
clay
formation
dry
and
perfectly
devoid
of
any
moisture
and
baked
hard
by
the
sun
turning
off
towards
the
river
we
reached
the
bank
in
about
a
mile
and
were
delighted
to
find
an
old
tree
with
thick
foliage
and
spreading
branches
where
we
encamped
at
sunset
the
barometer
was
at
thermometer
with
a
strong
wind
from
and
the
sky
partially
covered
with
heavy
masses
of
cloud
which
settled
a
little
towards
the
horizon
by
ten
leaving
it
sufficiently
clear
for
astronomical
observations
which
placed
us
in
latitude
and
longitude
the
morning
was
very
pleasant
the
breeze
was
fresh
from
with
few
clouds
the
barometer
at
six
standing
at
and
the
thermometer
at
since
leaving
the
forks
our
route
had
passed
over
a
country
alternately
clay
and
sand
each
presenting
the
same
naked
waste
on
leaving
camp
this
morning
we
struck
again
a
sandy
region
in
which
the
vegetation
appeared
somewhat
more
vigorous
than
that
which
we
had
observed
for
the
last
few
days
and
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
were
some
tolerably
large
groves
of
timber
journeying
along
we
came
suddenly
upon
a
place
where
the
ground
was
covered
with
horses
tracks
which
had
been
made
since
the
rain
and
indicated
the
immediate
presence
of
indians
in
our
neighborhood
the
buffalo
too
which
the
day
before
had
been
so
numerous
were
nowhere
in
sight
another
sure
indication
that
there
were
people
near
riding
on
we
discovered
the
carcass
of
a
buffalo
recently
killed
perhaps
the
day
before
we
scanned
the
horizon
carefully
with
the
glass
but
no
living
object
was
to
be
seen
for
the
next
mile
or
two
the
ground
was
dotted
with
buffalo
carcasses
which
showed
that
the
indians
had
made
a
surround
here
and
were
in
considerable
force
we
went
on
quickly
and
cautiously
keeping
the
river
bottom
and
carefully
avoiding
the
hills
but
we
met
with
no
interruption
and
began
to
grow
careless
again
we
had
already
lost
one
of
our
horses
and
here
basil
mule
showed
symptoms
of
giving
out
and
finally
refused
to
advance
being
what
the
canadians
call
he
therefore
dismounted
and
drove
her
along
before
him
but
this
was
a
very
slow
way
of
traveling
we
had
inadvertently
got
about
half
a
mile
in
advance
but
our
cheyennes
who
were
generally
a
mile
or
two
in
the
rear
remained
with
him
there
were
some
objects
among
the
hills
about
two
miles
to
the
left
here
low
and
undulating
which
we
had
seen
for
a
little
time
and
supposed
to
be
buffalo
coming
in
to
water
but
happening
to
look
behind
maxwell
saw
the
cheyennes
whipping
up
furiously
and
another
glance
at
the
dark
objects
showed
them
at
once
to
be
indians
coming
up
at
speed
had
we
been
well
mounted
and
disencumbered
of
instruments
we
might
have
set
them
at
defiance
but
as
it
was
we
were
fairly
caught
it
was
too
late
to
rejoin
our
friends
and
we
endeavored
to
gain
a
clump
of
timber
about
half
a
mile
ahead
but
the
instruments
and
tired
state
of
our
horses
did
not
allow
us
to
go
faster
than
a
steady
canter
and
they
were
gaining
on
us
fast
at
first
they
did
not
appear
to
be
more
than
fifteen
or
twenty
in
number
but
group
after
group
darted
into
view
at
the
top
of
the
hills
until
all
the
little
eminences
seemed
in
motion
and
in
a
few
minutes
from
the
time
they
were
first
discovered
two
or
three
hundred
naked
to
the
breechcloth
were
sweeping
across
the
prairie
in
a
few
hundred
yards
we
discovered
that
the
timber
we
were
endeavoring
to
make
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
and
before
we
reach
the
bank
down
came
the
indians
upon
us
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
in
a
few
seconds
more
the
leading
man
and
perhaps
some
of
his
companions
would
have
rolled
in
the
dust
for
we
had
jerked
the
covers
from
our
guns
and
our
fingers
were
on
the
triggers
men
in
such
cases
generally
act
from
instinct
and
a
charge
from
three
hundred
naked
savages
is
a
circumstance
not
well
calculated
to
promote
a
cool
exercise
of
judgment
just
as
he
was
about
to
fire
maxwell
recognised
the
leading
indian
and
shouted
to
him
in
the
indian
language
you
a
fool
g
damn
you
do
you
know
me
the
sound
of
his
own
language
seemed
to
shock
the
savage
and
swerving
his
horse
a
little
he
passed
us
like
an
arrow
he
wheeled
as
i
rode
out
towards
him
and
gave
me
his
hand
striking
his
breast
and
exclaiming
arapaho
they
proved
to
be
a
village
of
that
nation
among
whom
maxwell
had
resided
as
a
trader
a
year
or
two
previously
and
recognised
him
accordingly
we
were
soon
in
the
midst
of
the
band
answering
as
well
as
we
could
a
multitude
of
questions
of
which
the
very
first
was
of
what
tribe
were
our
indian
companions
who
were
coming
in
the
rear
they
seemed
disappointed
to
know
that
they
were
cheyennes
for
they
had
fully
anticipated
a
grand
dance
around
a
pawnee
scalp
that
night
the
chief
showed
us
his
village
at
a
grove
on
the
river
six
miles
ahead
and
pointed
out
a
band
of
buffalo
on
the
other
side
of
the
platte
immediately
opposite
us
which
he
said
they
were
going
to
surround
they
had
seen
the
band
early
in
the
morning
from
their
village
and
had
been
making
a
large
circuit
to
avoid
giving
them
the
wind
when
they
discovered
us
in
a
few
minutes
the
women
came
galloping
up
astride
on
their
horses
and
naked
from
their
knees
down
and
the
hips
up
they
followed
the
men
to
assist
in
cutting
up
and
carrying
off
the
meat
the
wind
was
blowing
directly
across
the
river
and
the
chief
requested
us
to
halt
where
we
were
for
awhile
in
order
to
avoid
raising
the
herd
we
therefore
unsaddled
our
horses
and
sat
down
on
the
bank
to
view
the
scene
and
our
new
acquaintances
rode
a
few
hundred
yards
lower
down
and
began
crossing
the
river
scores
of
dogs
followed
looking
like
troops
of
wolves
and
having
in
fact
but
very
little
of
the
dog
in
their
composition
some
of
them
remained
with
us
and
i
checked
one
of
the
men
whom
i
found
aiming
at
one
which
he
was
about
to
kill
for
a
wolf
the
day
had
become
very
hot
the
air
was
clear
with
a
very
slight
breeze
and
now
at
while
the
barometer
stood
at
the
attached
thermometer
was
at
our
cheyennes
had
learned
that
with
the
arapaho
village
were
about
twenty
lodges
of
their
own
including
their
own
families
they
therefore
immediately
commenced
making
their
toilette
after
bathing
in
the
river
they
invested
themselves
in
some
handsome
calico
shirts
which
i
afterwards
learned
they
had
stolen
from
my
own
men
and
spent
some
time
in
arranging
their
hair
and
painting
themselves
with
some
vermilion
i
had
given
them
while
they
were
engaged
in
this
satisfactory
manner
one
of
their
horses
to
which
the
crowd
of
prancing
animals
which
had
just
passed
had
recalled
the
freedom
of
her
existence
among
the
wild
droves
on
the
prairie
suddenly
dashed
into
the
hills
at
the
top
of
her
speed
she
was
their
and
had
on
her
back
all
the
worldly
wealth
of
our
poor
cheyennes
all
their
accoutrements
and
all
the
little
articles
which
they
had
picked
up
among
us
with
some
few
presents
i
had
given
them
the
loss
which
they
seemed
to
regret
most
were
their
spears
and
shields
and
some
tobacco
which
they
had
received
from
me
however
they
bore
it
all
with
the
philosophy
of
an
indian
and
laughingly
continued
their
toilette
they
appeared
however
to
be
a
little
mortified
at
the
thought
of
returning
to
the
village
in
such
a
sorry
plight
our
people
will
laugh
at
us
said
one
of
them
returning
to
the
village
on
foot
instead
of
driving
back
a
drove
of
pawnee
horses
he
demanded
to
know
if
i
loved
my
sorrel
hunter
very
much
to
which
i
replied
he
was
the
object
of
my
most
intense
affection
far
from
being
able
to
give
i
was
myself
in
want
of
horses
and
any
suggestion
of
parting
with
the
few
i
had
valuable
was
met
with
a
peremptory
refusal
in
the
mean
time
the
slaughter
was
about
to
commence
on
the
other
side
so
soon
as
they
reached
it
indians
separated
into
two
bodies
one
party
proceeded
across
the
prairie
towards
the
hills
in
an
extended
line
while
the
other
went
up
the
river
and
instantly
as
they
had
given
the
wind
to
the
herd
the
chase
commenced
the
buffalo
started
for
the
hills
but
were
intercepted
and
driven
back
towards
the
river
broken
and
running
in
every
direction
the
clouds
of
dust
soon
covered
the
whole
scene
preventing
us
from
having
any
but
an
occasional
view
it
had
a
very
singular
appearance
to
us
at
a
distance
especially
when
looking
with
the
glass
we
were
too
far
to
hear
the
report
of
the
guns
or
any
sound
and
at
every
instant
through
the
clouds
of
dust
which
the
sun
made
luminous
we
could
see
for
a
moment
two
or
three
buffalo
dashing
along
and
close
behind
them
an
indian
with
his
long
spear
or
other
weapon
and
instantly
again
they
disappeared
the
apparent
silence
and
the
dimly
seen
figures
flitting
by
with
such
rapidity
gave
it
a
kind
of
dreamy
effect
and
seemed
more
like
a
picture
than
a
scene
of
real
life
it
had
been
a
large
herd
when
the
commenced
probably
three
or
four
hundred
in
number
but
though
i
watched
them
closely
i
did
not
see
one
emerge
from
the
fatal
cloud
where
the
work
of
destruction
was
going
on
after
remaining
here
about
an
hour
we
resumed
our
journey
in
the
direction
of
the
village
gradually
as
we
rode
on
indian
after
indian
came
dropping
along
laden
with
meat
and
by
the
time
we
had
neared
the
lodges
the
backward
road
was
covered
with
the
returning
horsemen
it
was
a
pleasant
contrast
with
the
desert
road
we
had
been
traveling
several
had
joined
company
with
us
and
one
of
the
chiefs
invited
us
to
his
lodge
the
village
consisted
of
about
one
hundred
and
lodges
of
which
twenty
were
cheyennes
the
latter
pitched
a
little
apart
from
the
arapahoes
they
were
disposed
in
a
scattering
manner
on
both
sides
of
a
broad
irregular
street
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
wide
and
running
along
the
river
as
we
rode
along
i
remarked
near
some
of
the
lodges
a
kind
of
tripod
frame
formed
of
three
slender
poles
of
birch
scraped
very
clean
to
which
were
affixed
the
shield
and
spear
with
some
other
weapons
of
a
chief
all
were
scrupulously
clean
the
was
burnished
bright
and
the
shield
white
and
stainless
it
reminded
me
of
the
days
of
feudal
chivalry
and
when
as
i
rode
by
i
yielded
to
the
passing
impulse
and
touched
one
of
the
spotless
shields
with
the
muzzle
of
my
gun
i
almost
expected
a
grim
warrior
to
start
from
the
lodge
and
resent
my
challenge
the
master
of
the
lodge
spread
out
a
robe
for
me
to
sit
upon
and
the
squaws
set
before
us
a
large
wooden
dish
of
buffalo
meat
he
had
lit
his
pipe
in
the
mean
while
and
when
it
had
been
passed
around
we
commenced
our
dinner
while
he
continued
to
smoke
gradually
however
five
or
six
other
chiefs
came
in
and
took
their
seats
in
silence
when
we
had
finished
our
host
asked
a
number
of
questions
relative
to
the
object
of
our
journey
of
which
i
made
no
concealment
telling
him
simply
that
i
had
made
a
visit
to
see
the
country
preparatory
to
the
establishment
of
military
posts
on
the
way
to
the
mountains
although
this
was
information
of
the
highest
interest
to
them
and
by
no
means
calculated
to
please
them
it
excited
no
expression
of
surprise
and
in
no
way
altered
the
grave
courtesy
of
their
demeanor
the
others
listened
and
smoked
i
remarked
that
in
taking
the
pipe
for
the
first
time
each
had
turned
the
stem
upward
with
a
rapid
glance
as
in
offering
to
the
great
spirit
before
he
put
it
in
his
mouth
a
storm
had
been
gathering
for
the
past
hour
and
some
pattering
drops
in
the
lodge
warned
us
that
we
had
some
miles
to
our
camp
an
indian
had
given
maxwell
a
bundle
of
dried
meat
which
was
very
acceptable
as
we
had
nothing
and
springing
upon
our
horses
we
rode
off
at
dusk
in
the
face
of
a
cold
shower
and
driving
wind
we
found
our
companions
under
some
densely
foliaged
old
trees
about
three
miles
up
the
river
under
one
of
them
lay
the
trunk
of
a
large
cottonwood
to
leeward
of
which
the
men
had
kindled
a
fire
and
we
sat
here
and
roasted
our
meat
in
tolerable
shelter
nearly
opposite
was
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
most
considerable
affluents
of
the
south
fork
fourche
aux
beaver
fork
heading
off
in
the
ridge
to
the
southeast
this
morning
we
caught
the
first
faint
glimpse
of
the
rocky
mountains
about
sixty
miles
distant
though
a
tolerably
bright
day
there
was
a
slight
mist
and
we
were
just
able
to
discern
the
snowy
summit
of
long
peak
deux
of
the
canadians
showing
like
a
cloud
near
the
horizon
i
found
it
easily
distinguishable
there
being
a
perceptible
difference
in
its
appearance
from
the
white
clouds
that
were
floating
about
the
sky
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
among
the
traders
the
name
of
long
peak
had
been
adopted
and
become
familiar
in
the
country
in
the
ravines
near
this
place
a
light
brown
sandstone
made
its
first
appearance
about
we
discerned
several
persons
on
horseback
a
mile
or
two
ahead
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
they
turned
in
towards
the
river
and
we
rode
down
to
meet
them
we
found
them
to
be
two
white
men
and
a
mulatto
named
jim
beckwith
who
had
left
louis
when
a
boy
and
gone
to
live
with
the
crow
indians
he
had
distinguished
himself
among
them
by
some
acts
of
daring
bravery
and
had
risen
to
the
rank
of
chief
but
had
now
for
some
years
left
them
they
were
in
search
of
a
band
of
horses
that
had
gone
off
from
a
camp
some
miles
above
in
charge
of
chabonard
two
of
them
continued
down
the
river
in
search
of
the
horses
and
the
american
turned
back
with
us
and
we
rode
on
towards
the
camp
about
eight
miles
from
our
we
reached
fork
an
affluent
of
the
right
bank
where
we
crossed
it
a
short
distance
from
the
platte
it
has
a
sandy
bed
about
four
hundred
yards
broad
the
water
in
various
small
streams
a
few
inches
deep
seven
miles
further
brought
us
to
the
camp
of
some
four
or
five
whites
new
englanders
i
believe
who
had
accompanied
captain
wyeth
to
the
columbia
river
and
were
independent
trappers
all
had
their
squaws
with
them
and
i
was
really
surprised
at
the
number
of
little
fat
boys
that
were
tumbling
about
the
camp
all
apparently
of
the
same
age
about
three
or
four
years
old
they
were
encamped
on
a
rich
bottom
covered
with
a
profusion
of
rich
grass
and
had
a
large
number
of
horses
and
mules
we
rested
with
them
a
few
minutes
and
in
about
two
miles
arrived
at
chabonard
camp
on
an
island
in
the
platte
on
the
heights
above
we
met
the
first
spaniard
i
had
seen
in
the
country
chabonard
was
in
the
service
of
bent
and
vrain
company
and
had
left
their
fort
some
forty
or
fifty
miles
above
in
the
spring
with
boats
laden
with
the
furs
of
the
last
trade
he
had
met
the
same
fortune
as
the
voyageurs
on
the
north
fork
and
finding
it
impossible
to
proceed
had
taken
up
his
residence
on
this
island
which
he
had
named
helena
the
river
hills
appeared
to
be
composed
entirely
of
sand
and
the
platte
had
lost
the
muddy
character
of
its
waters
and
here
was
tolerably
clear
from
the
mouth
of
the
south
fork
i
had
found
it
occasionally
broken
up
by
small
islands
and
at
the
time
of
our
journey
which
was
at
a
season
of
the
year
when
the
waters
were
at
a
favorable
stage
it
was
not
navigable
for
any
thing
drawing
six
inches
water
the
current
was
very
swift
the
bed
of
the
stream
a
coarse
gravel
from
the
place
at
which
we
had
encountered
the
arapahoes
the
platte
had
been
tolerably
well
fringed
with
timber
and
the
island
here
had
a
fine
grove
of
very
large
cottonwoods
under
whose
broad
shade
the
tents
were
pitched
there
was
a
large
drove
of
horses
in
the
opposite
prairie
bottom
smoke
was
rising
from
the
scattered
fires
and
the
encampment
had
quite
a
patriarchal
air
received
us
hospitably
one
of
the
people
was
sent
to
gather
mint
with
the
aid
of
which
he
concocted
very
good
julep
and
some
boiled
buffalo
tongue
and
coffee
with
the
luxury
of
sugar
were
soon
set
before
us
the
people
in
his
employ
were
generally
spaniards
and
among
them
i
saw
a
young
spanish
woman
from
taos
whom
i
found
to
be
beckwith
wife
we
parted
with
our
hospitable
host
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
and
reached
vrain
fort
about
miles
from
helena
late
in
the
evening
this
post
is
situated
on
the
south
fork
of
the
platte
immediately
under
the
mountains
about
seventeen
miles
east
of
long
peak
it
is
on
the
right
bank
on
the
verge
of
the
upland
prairie
about
forty
feet
above
the
river
of
which
the
immediate
valley
is
about
six
hundred
yards
wide
the
stream
is
divided
into
various
branches
by
small
islands
among
which
it
runs
with
a
swift
current
the
bed
of
the
river
is
sand
and
gravel
the
water
very
clear
and
here
may
be
called
a
this
region
appears
to
be
entirely
free
from
the
limestones
and
marls
which
give
to
the
lower
platte
its
yellow
and
dirty
color
the
black
hills
lie
between
the
stream
and
the
mountains
whose
snowy
peaks
glitter
a
few
miles
beyond
at
the
fort
we
found
vrain
who
received
us
with
much
kindness
and
hospitality
maxwell
had
spent
the
last
two
or
three
years
between
this
post
and
the
village
of
taos
and
here
he
was
at
home
and
among
his
friends
spaniards
frequently
came
over
in
search
of
employment
and
several
came
in
shortly
after
our
arrival
they
usually
obtain
about
six
dollars
a
month
generally
paid
to
them
in
goods
they
are
very
useful
in
a
camp
in
taking
care
of
horses
and
mules
and
i
engaged
one
who
proved
to
be
an
active
laborious
man
and
was
of
very
considerable
service
to
me
the
elevation
of
the
platte
here
is
five
thousand
four
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
the
neighboring
mountains
did
not
appear
to
enter
far
the
region
of
perpetual
snow
which
was
generally
confined
to
the
northern
side
of
the
peaks
on
the
southern
i
remarked
very
little
here
it
appeared
so
far
as
i
could
judge
in
the
distance
to
descend
but
a
few
hundred
feet
below
the
summits
i
regretted
that
time
did
not
permit
me
to
visit
them
but
the
proper
object
of
my
survey
lay
among
the
mountains
farther
north
and
i
looked
forward
to
an
exploration
of
their
snowy
recesses
with
great
pleasure
the
piney
region
of
the
mountains
to
the
south
was
enveloped
in
smoke
and
i
was
informed
had
been
on
fire
for
several
months
pike
peak
is
said
to
be
visible
from
this
place
about
one
hundred
miles
to
the
southward
but
the
smoky
state
of
the
atmosphere
prevented
my
seeing
it
the
weather
continued
overcast
during
my
stay
here
so
that
i
failed
in
determining
the
latitude
but
obtained
good
observations
for
the
time
on
the
mornings
of
the
and
an
assumed
latitude
of
from
the
evening
position
of
the
enabled
me
to
obtain
for
a
tolerably
correct
longitude
the
kindness
of
vrain
enabled
me
to
obtain
a
couple
of
horses
and
three
good
mules
and
with
a
further
addition
to
our
party
of
the
spaniard
whom
i
had
hired
and
two
others
who
were
going
to
obtain
service
at
laramie
fork
we
resumed
our
journey
at
ten
on
the
morning
of
the
we
had
been
able
to
procure
nothing
at
the
post
in
the
way
of
provision
an
expected
supply
from
taos
had
not
yet
arrived
and
a
few
pounds
of
coffee
was
all
that
could
be
spared
to
us
in
addition
to
this
we
had
dried
meat
enough
for
the
first
day
on
the
next
we
expected
to
find
buffalo
from
this
post
according
to
the
estimate
of
the
country
the
fort
at
the
mouth
of
laramie
fork
which
was
our
next
point
of
destination
was
nearly
due
north
distant
about
one
hundred
and
miles
for
a
short
distance
our
road
lay
down
the
valley
of
the
platte
which
resembled
a
garden
in
the
splendor
of
fields
of
varied
flowers
which
filled
the
air
with
fragrance
the
only
timber
i
noticed
consisted
of
poplar
birch
cottonwood
and
willow
in
something
less
than
three
miles
we
crossed
thompson
creek
one
of
the
affluents
to
the
left
bank
of
the
south
fork
a
fine
stream
about
feet
wide
and
three
feet
deep
journeying
on
the
low
dark
line
of
the
black
hills
lying
between
us
and
the
mountains
to
the
left
in
about
ten
miles
from
the
fort
we
reached
à
la
where
we
halted
to
noon
this
is
a
very
beautiful
about
one
hundred
feet
wide
flowing
with
a
full
swift
current
over
a
rocky
bed
we
halted
under
the
shade
of
some
cottonwoods
with
which
the
stream
is
wooded
scatteringly
in
the
upper
part
of
its
course
it
runs
amid
the
wildest
mountain
scenery
and
breaking
through
the
black
hills
falls
into
the
platte
about
ten
miles
below
this
place
in
the
course
of
our
late
journey
i
had
managed
to
become
the
possessor
of
a
very
untractable
mule
a
perfect
vixen
and
her
i
had
turned
over
to
my
spaniard
it
occupied
us
about
half
an
hour
to
get
saddle
upon
her
but
once
on
her
back
jose
could
not
be
dismounted
realizing
the
accounts
given
of
mexican
horses
and
horsemanship
and
we
continued
our
route
in
the
afternoon
at
evening
we
encamped
on
crow
creek
having
traveled
about
miles
none
of
the
party
were
well
acquainted
with
the
country
and
i
had
great
difficulty
in
ascertaining
what
were
the
names
of
the
streams
we
crossed
between
the
north
and
south
forks
of
the
platte
this
i
supposed
to
be
cow
creek
it
is
what
is
called
a
salt
stream
and
the
water
stands
in
pools
having
no
continuous
course
a
sandstone
made
its
appearance
in
the
banks
the
observations
of
the
night
placed
us
in
latitude
longitude
the
barometer
at
sunset
was
attached
thermometer
at
sky
clear
except
in
the
east
with
a
light
wind
from
the
north
there
being
no
wood
here
we
used
last
night
the
de
which
is
very
plentiful
at
our
camp
this
morning
the
barometer
was
at
the
attached
thermometer
a
few
clouds
were
moving
through
a
sky
with
a
light
wind
from
the
west
after
a
ride
of
twelve
miles
in
a
northerly
direction
over
a
plain
covered
with
innumerable
quantities
of
we
reached
a
small
creek
in
which
there
was
water
and
where
several
herds
of
buffalo
were
scattered
about
among
the
ravines
which
always
afford
good
pasturage
we
seem
now
to
be
passing
along
the
base
of
a
plateau
of
the
black
hills
in
which
the
formation
consists
of
marls
some
of
them
white
and
laminated
the
country
to
the
left
rising
suddenly
and
falling
off
gradually
and
uniformly
to
the
right
in
five
or
six
miles
of
a
northeasterly
course
we
struck
a
high
ridge
broken
into
conical
peaks
on
whose
summits
large
boulders
were
gathered
in
heaps
the
magnetic
direction
of
the
ridge
is
northwest
and
southeast
the
glittering
white
of
its
precipitous
sides
making
it
visible
for
many
miles
to
the
south
it
is
composed
of
a
soft
earthy
limestone
and
marls
resembling
that
hereafter
described
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
chimney
rock
on
the
north
fork
of
the
platte
easily
worked
by
the
winds
and
rains
and
sometimes
moulded
into
very
fantastic
shapes
at
the
foot
of
the
northern
slope
was
the
bed
of
a
creek
some
forty
feet
wide
coming
by
frequent
falls
from
the
bench
above
it
was
shut
in
by
high
perpendicular
banks
in
which
were
strata
of
white
laminated
marl
its
bed
was
perfectly
dry
and
the
leading
feature
of
the
whole
region
is
one
of
remarkable
aridity
and
perfect
freedom
from
moisture
in
about
six
miles
we
crossed
the
bed
of
another
dry
creek
and
continuing
our
ride
over
high
level
prairie
a
little
before
sundown
we
came
suddenly
upon
a
beautiful
creek
which
revived
us
with
a
feeling
of
delighted
surprise
by
the
pleasant
contrast
of
the
deep
verdure
of
its
banks
with
the
parched
desert
we
had
passed
we
had
suffered
much
both
men
and
horses
for
want
of
water
having
met
with
it
but
once
in
our
uninterrupted
march
of
forty
miles

an
exclusive
meat

creates
much
thirst

here
a
stream
of
good
and
clear
water
ran
winding
about
through
the
little
valley
and
a
herd
of
buffalo
were
quietly
feeding
a
little
distance
below
it
was
quite
a
hunter
paradise
and
while
some
ran
down
towards
the
band
to
kill
one
for
supper
others
collected
de
for
a
fire
there
being
no

and
i
amused
myself
with
hunting
for
plants
among
the
grass
it
will
be
seen
by
occasional
remarks
on
the
geological
formation
that
the
constituents
of
the
soil
in
these
regions
are
good
and
every
day
served
to
strengthen
the
impression
in
my
mind
confirmed
by
subsequent
observation
that
the
barren
appearance
of
the
country
is
due
almost
entirely
to
the
extreme
dryness
of
the
climate
along
our
route
the
country
had
seemed
to
increase
constantly
in
elevation
according
to
the
indication
of
the
barometer
we
were
at
our
encampment
feet
above
the
sea
the
evening
was
very
clear
with
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
south
east
the
barometer
at
sunset
was
the
thermometer
attached
showing
i
supposed
this
to
be
a
fork
of
lodge
pole

so
far
as
i
could
determine
from
our
uncertain
means
of
information
astronomical

gave
for
the

of
a
few

our
course
this
morning
was
directly

the

a
ride
of
four
miles
brought
us
to

from
our
encampment
of
the
past
night
we
reached
a
high
bleak
ridge
composed
entirely
of
the
same
earthy
limestone
and
marl
previously
described
i
had
never
seen
any
thing
which
impressed
so
strongly
on
my
mind
a
feeling
of
desolation
the
valley
through
which
ran
the
waters
of
horse
creek
lay
in
view
to
the
north
but
too
far
to
have
any
influence
on
the
immediate
view
on
the
peak
of
the
ridge
where
i
was
standing
some
seven
hundred
feet
above
the
river
the
wind
was
high
and
bleak
the
barren
and
arid
country
seemed
as
if
it
had
been
swept
by
fires
and
in
every
direction
the
same
dull
hue
derived
from
the
formation
met
the
eye
on
the
summits
were
some
stunted
pines
many
of
them
dead
all
wearing
the
same
ashen
hue
of
desolation
we
left
the
place
with
pleasure
and
after
we
had
descended
several
hundred
feet
halted
in
one
of
the
ravines
which
at
the
distance
of
every
mile
or
two
cut
the
flanks
of
the
ridge
with
little
rushing
streams
wearing
something
of
a
mountain
character
we
had
already
begun
to
exchange
the
comparatively
barren
lands
for
those
of
a
more
fertile
character
though
the
sandstone
formed
the
broken
banks
of
the
creek
yet
they
were
covered
with
a
thin
grass
and
the
fifty
or
sixty
feet
which
formed
the
bottom
land
of
the
little
stream
were
clothed
with
very
luxuriant
grass
among
which
i
remarked
willow
and
cherry
and
a
quantity
of
gooseberry
and
currant
bushes
occupied
the
greater
part
the
creek
was
three
or
four
feet
broad
and
about
six
inches
deep
with
a
swift
current
of
clear
water
and
tolerably
cool
we
had
struck
it
too
low
down
to
find
the
cold
water
which
we
should
have
enjoyed
nearer
to
its
sources
at
two
the
barometer
was
at
and
the
attached
thermometer
a
day
of
hot
sunshine
with
clouds
and
moderate
breeze
from
the
south
continuing
down
the
stream
in
about
four
miles
we
reached
its
mouth
at
one
of
the
main
branches
of
horse
creek
looking
back
upon
the
ridge
whose
direction
appeared
to
be
a
little
to
the
north
of
east
we
saw
it
seamed
at
frequent
intervals
with
the
dark
lines
of
wooded
streams
affluents
of
the
river
that
flowed
so
far
as
we
could
see
along
its
base
we
crossed
in
the
space
of
twelve
miles
from
our
noon
halt
three
or
four
forks
of
horse
creek
and
encamped
at
sunset
on
the
most
easterly
the
fork
on
which
we
encamped
appeared
to
have
followed
an
easterly
direction
up
to
this
place
but
here
it
makes
a
very
sudden
bend
to
the
north
passing
between
two
ranges
of
precipitous
hills
called
as
i
was
informed
goshen
hole
there
is
somewhere
in
or
near
this
locality
a
place
so
called
but
i
am
not
certain
that
it
was
the
place
of
our
encampment
looking
back
upon
the
spot
at
the
distance
of
a
few
miles
to
the
northward
the
hills
appear
to
shut
in
the
prairie
through
which
runs
the
creek
with
a
semicircular
sweep
which
might
very
naturally
be
called
a
hole
in
the
bills
the
geological
composition
of
the
ridge
is
the
same
which
constitutes
the
rock
of
the
and
chimney
on
the
north
fork
which
appeared
to
me
a
continuation
of
this
ridge
the
winds
and
rains
work
this
formation
into
a
variety
of
singular
forms
the
pass
into
goshen
hole
is
about
two
miles
wide
and
the
hill
on
the
western
side
imitates
in
an
extraordinary
manner
a
massive
fortified
place
with
a
remarkable
fulness
of
detail
the
rock
is
marl
and
earthy
limestone
white
without
the
least
appearance
of
vegetation
and
much
resembles
masonry
at
a
little
distance
and
here
it
sweeps
around
a
level
area
two
or
three
hundred
yards
in
diameter
and
in
the
form
of
a
half
moon
terminating
on
either
extremity
in
enormous
bastions
along
the
whole
line
of
the
parapets
appear
domes
and
slender
minarets
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
giving
it
every
appearance
of
an
old
fortified
town
on
the
waters
of
white
river
where
this
formation
exists
in
great
extent
it
presents
appearances
which
excite
the
admiration
of
the
solitary
voyageur
and
form
a
frequent
theme
of
their
conversation
when
speaking
of
the
wonders
of
the
country
sometimes
it
offers
the
perfectly
illusive
appearance
of
a
large
city
with
numerous
streets
and
magnificent
buildings
among
which
the
canadians
never
fail
to
see
their
and
sometimes
it
takes
the
form
of
a
solitary
house
with
many
large
chambers
into
which
they
drive
their
horses
at
night
and
sleep
in
these
natural
defences
perfectly
secure
from
any
attack
of
prowling
savages
before
reaching
our
camp
at
goshen
hole
in
crossing
the
immense
detritus
at
the
foot
of
the
castle
rock
we
were
involved
amidst
winding
passages
cut
by
the
waters
of
the
hill
and
where
with
a
breadth
scarcely
large
enough
for
the
passage
of
a
horse
the
walls
rise
thirty
and
forty
feet
perpendicularly
this
formation
supplies
the
discoloration
of
the
platte
at
sunset
the
height
of
the
mercurial
column
was
the
attached
thermometer
and
wind
moderate
from
clouds
covered
the
sky
with
the
rise
of
the
moon
but
i
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
usual
astronomical
observations
which
placed
us
in
latitude
and
longitude
at
six
this
morning
the
barometer
was
at
the
thermometer
the
day
was
fine
with
some
clouds
looking
dark
on
the
south
with
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
same
quarter
we
found
that
in
our
journey
across
the
country
we
had
kept
too
much
to
the
eastward
this
morning
accordingly
we
traveled
by
compass
some
or
to
the
west
of
north
and
struck
the
platte
some
thirteen
miles
below
fort
laramie
the
day
was
extremely
hot
and
among
the
hills
the
wind
seemed
to
have
just
issued
from
an
oven
our
horses
were
much
distressed
as
we
had
traveled
hard
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
they
were
all
brought
to
the
platte
which
we
reached
at
one
in
riding
in
towards
the
river
we
found
the
trail
of
our
carts
which
appeared
to
have
passed
a
day
or
two
since
after
having
allowed
our
animals
two
hours
for
food
and
repose
we
resumed
our
journey
and
towards
the
close
of
the
day
came
in
sight
of
laramie
fork
issuing
from
the
river
hills
we
came
first
in
view
of
fort
platte
a
post
belonging
to
sybille
adams
situated
immediately
in
the
point
of
land
at
the
junction
of
laramie
with
the
platte
like
the
post
we
had
visited
on
the
south
fork
it
was
built
of
earth
and
still
unfinished
being
enclosed
with
walls
or
rather
houses
on
three
of
the
sides
and
open
on
the
fourth
to
the
river
a
few
hundred
yards
brought
us
in
view
of
the
post
of
the
american
fur
company
called
fort
john
or
laramie
this
was
a
large
post
having
more
the
air
of
military
construction
than
the
fort
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
it
is
on
the
left
bank
on
a
rising
ground
some
feet
above
the
water
and
its
lofty
walls
whitewashed
and
picketed
with
the
large
bastions
at
the
angles
gave
it
quite
an
imposing
appearance
in
the
uncertain
light
of
evening
a
cluster
of
lodges
which
the
language
told
us
belonged
to
sioux
indians
was
pitched
under
the
walls
and
with
the
fine
background
of
the
black
hills
and
the
prominent
peak
of
laramie
mountain
strongly
drawn
in
the
clear
light
of
the
western
sky
where
the
sun
had
already
set
the
whole
formed
at
the
moment
a
strikingly
beautiful
picture
from
the
company
at
louis
i
had
letters
for
boudeau
the
gentleman
in
charge
of
the
post
by
whom
i
was
received
with
great
hospitality
and
an
efficient
kindness
which
was
invaluable
to
me
during
my
stay
in
the
country
i
found
our
people
encamped
on
the
bank
a
short
distance
above
the
fort
all
were
well
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
bountiful
supper
which
coffee
and
bread
made
luxurious
to
us
we
soon
forgot
the
fatigues
of
the
last
ten
days
i
found
that
during
my
absence
the
situation
of
affairs
had
undergone
some
change
and
the
usual
quiet
and
somewhat
monotonous
regularity
of
the
camp
had
given
place
to
excitement
and
alarm
the
circumstances
which
occasioned
this
change
will
be
found
narrated
in
the
following
extract
from
the
journal
of
preuss
which
commences
with
the
day
of
our
separation
on
the
south
fork
of
the
platte
we
crossed
the
plateau
or
highland
between
the
two
forks
in
about
six
hours
i
let
my
horse
go
as
slow
as
he
liked
to
indemnify
us
both
for
the
previous
hardship
and
about
noon
we
reached
the
north
fork
there
was
no
sign
that
our
party
had
passed
we
rode
therefore
to
some
pine
trees
unsaddled
the
hoses
and
stretched
our
limbs
on
the
grass
awaiting
the
arrival
of
our
company
after
remaining
here
two
hours
my
companion
became
impatient
mounted
his
horse
again
and
rode
off
down
the
river
to
see
if
he
could
discover
our
people
i
felt
so
marode
yet
that
it
was
a
horrible
idea
to
me
to
bestride
that
saddle
again
so
i
lay
still
i
knew
they
could
not
come
any
other
way
and
then
my
companion
one
of
the
best
men
of
the
company
would
not
abandon
me
the
sun
went
down
he
did
not
come
uneasy
i
did
not
feel
but
very
hungry
i
had
no
provisions
but
i
could
make
a
fire
and
as
i
espied
two
doves
in
a
tree
i
tried
to
kill
one
but
it
needs
a
better
marksman
than
myself
to
kill
a
little
bird
with
a
rifle
i
made
a
fire
however
lighted
my
pipe
this
true
friend
of
mine
in
every
emergency
lay
down
and
let
my
thoughts
wander
to
the
far
east
it
was
not
many
minutes
after
when
i
heard
the
tramp
of
a
horse
and
my
faithful
companion
was
by
my
side
he
had
found
the
party
who
had
been
delayed
by
making
their
about
seven
miles
below
to
the
good
supper
which
he
brought
with
him
i
did
ample
justice
he
had
forgotten
salt
and
i
tried
the
soldier
substitute
in
time
of
war
and
used
gunpowder
but
it
answered
badly
bitter
enough
but
no
flavor
of
kitchen
salt
i
slept
well
and
was
only
disturbed
by
two
owls
which
were
attracted
by
the
fire
and
took
their
place
in
the
tree
under
which
we
slept
their
music
seemed
as
disagreeable
to
my
companion
as
to
myself
he
fired
his
rifle
twice
and
then
they
let
us
alone
at
about
the
party
arrived
and
we
continued
our
journey
through
a
country
which
offered
but
little
to
interest
the
traveler
the
soil
was
much
more
sandy
than
in
the
valley
below
the
confluence
of
the
forks
and
the
face
of
the
country
no
longer
presented
the
refreshing
green
which
had
hitherto
characterized
it
the
rich
grass
was
now
found
only
in
dispersed
spots
on
low
grounds
and
on
the
bottom
land
of
the
streams
a
long
drought
joined
to
extreme
heat
had
so
parched
up
the
upper
prairies
that
they
were
in
many
places
bald
or
covered
only
with
a
thin
growth
of
yellow
and
poor
grass
the
nature
of
the
soil
renders
it
extremely
susceptible
to
the
vicissitudes
of
the
climate
between
the
forks
and
from
their
junction
to
the
black
hills
the
formation
consists
of
marl
and
a
soft
earthy
limestone
with
granitic
sandstone
such
a
formation
can
not
give
rise
to
a
sterile
soil
and
on
our
return
in
september
when
the
country
had
been
watered
by
frequent
rains
the
valley
of
the
platte
looked
like
a
garden
so
rich
was
the
verdure
of
the
grasses
and
so
luxuriant
the
bloom
of
abundant
flowers
the
wild
sage
begins
to
make
its
appearance
and
timber
is
so
scarce
that
we
generally
made
our
fires
of
the
de
with
the
exception
of
now
and
then
an
isolated
tree
or
two
standing
like
a
lighthouse
on
the
river
bank
there
is
none
to
be
seen
our
road
was
a
solitary
one
no
game
made
its
appearance
not
even
a
buffalo
or
a
stray
antelope
and
nothing
occurred
to
break
the
monotony
until
about
when
the
caravan
made
a
sudden
halt
there
was
a
galloping
in
of
scouts
and
horsemen
from
every
side
a
hurrying
to
and
fro
in
noisy
confusion
rifles
were
taken
from
their
covers
bullet
pouches
examined
in
short
there
was
the
cry
of
heard
again
i
had
become
so
much
accustomed
to
these
alarms
that
they
now
made
but
little
impression
on
me
and
before
i
had
time
to
become
excited
the
newcomers
were
ascertained
to
be
whites
it
was
a
large
party
of
traders
and
trappers
conducted
by
bridger
a
man
well
known
in
the
history
of
the
country
as
the
sun
was
low
and
there
was
a
fine
grass
patch
not
far
ahead
they
turned
back
and
encamped
for
the
night
with
us
bridger
was
invited
to
supper
and
after
the
was
removed
we
listened
with
eager
interest
to
an
account
of
their
adventures
what
they
had
met
we
would
be
likely
to
encounter
the
chances
which
had
befallen
them
would
probably
happen
to
us
and
we
looked
upon
their
life
as
a
picture
of
our
own
he
informed
us
that
the
condition
of
the
country
had
become
exceedingly
dangerous
the
sioux
who
had
been
badly
disposed
had
broken
out
into
open
hostility
and
in
the
preceding
autumn
his
party
had
encountered
them
in
a
severe
engagement
in
which
a
number
of
lives
had
been
lost
on
both
sides
united
with
the
cheyenne
and
gros
ventre
indians
they
were
scouring
the
upper
country
in
war
parties
of
great
force
and
were
at
this
time
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
a
famous
landmark
which
was
directly
in
our
path
they
had
declared
war
upon
every
living
thing
that
should
be
found
westward
of
that
point
though
their
main
object
was
to
attack
a
large
camp
of
whites
and
snake
indians
who
had
a
rendezvous
in
the
sweet
water
valley
availing
himself
of
his
intimate
knowledge
of
the
country
he
had
reached
laramie
by
an
unusual
route
through
the
black
hills
and
avoided
coming
into
contact
with
any
of
the
scattered
parties
this
gentleman
offered
his
services
to
accompany
us
as
far
as
the
head
of
the
sweet
water
but
the
absence
of
our
leader
which
was
deeply
regretted
by
us
all
rendered
it
impossible
for
us
to
enter
upon
such
arrangements
in
a
camp
consisting
of
men
whose
lives
had
been
spent
in
this
country
i
expected
to
find
every
one
prepared
for
occurrences
of
this
nature
but
to
my
great
surprise
i
found
on
the
contrary
that
this
news
had
thrown
them
all
into
the
greatest
consternation
and
on
every
side
i
heard
only
one
exclamation
aura
pas
de
vie
pour
all
the
night
scattered
groups
were
assembled
around
the
fires
smoking
their
pipes
and
listening
with
the
greatest
eagerness
to
exaggerated
details
of
indian
hostilities
and
in
the
morning
i
found
the
camp
dispirited
and
agitated
by
a
variety
of
conflicting
opinions
a
majority
of
the
people
were
strongly
disposed
to
return
but
clement
lambert
with
some
five
or
six
others
professed
their
determination
to
follow
fremont
to
the
uttermost
limit
of
his
journey
the
others
yielded
to
their
remonstrances
and
somewhat
ashamed
of
their
cowardice
concluded
to
advance
at
least
as
far
as
laramie
fork
eastward
of
which
they
were
aware
no
danger
was
to
be
apprehended
notwithstanding
the
confusion
and
excitement
we
were
very
early
on
the
road
as
the
days
were
extremely
hot
and
we
were
anxious
to
profit
by
the
freshness
of
the
morning
the
soft
marly
formation
over
which
we
were
now
journeying
frequently
offers
to
the
traveler
views
of
remarkable
and
picturesque
beauty
to
several
of
these
localities
where
the
winds
and
the
rain
have
worked
the
bluffs
into
curious
shapes
the
voyageurs
have
given
names
according
to
some
fancied
resemblance
one
of
these
called
the
we
passed
about
six
miles
from
our
encampment
of
last
night
and
towards
noon
came
in
sight
of
the
celebrated
it
looks
at
this
distance
of
about
thirty
miles
like
what
it
is
called
the
long
chimney
of
a
steam
factory
establishment
or
a
shot
tower
in
baltimore
nothing
occurred
to
interrupt
the
quiet
of
the
day
and
we
encamped
on
the
river
after
a
march
of
miles
buffalo
had
become
very
scarce
and
but
one
cow
had
been
killed
of
which
the
meat
had
been
cut
into
thin
slices
and
hung
around
the
carts
to
dry
we
continued
along
the
same
fine
plainly
beaten
road
which
the
smooth
surface
of
the
country
afforded
us
for
a
distance
of
six
hundred
and
thirty
miles
from
the
frontiers
of
missouri
to
the
laramie
fork
in
the
course
of
the
day
we
met
some
whites
who
were
following
along
in
the
train
of
bridger
and
after
a
day
journey
of
miles
encamped
about
sunset
at
the
chimney
rock
it
consists
of
marl
and
earthy
limestone
and
the
weather
is
rapidly
diminishing
its
height
which
is
not
more
than
two
hundred
feet
above
the
river
travelers
who
visited
it
some
years
since
placed
its
height
at
upwards
of
feet
the
valley
of
the
north
fork
is
of
a
variable
breadth
from
one
to
four
and
sometimes
six
miles
fifteen
miles
from
the
chimney
rock
we
reached
one
of
those
places
where
the
river
strikes
the
bluffs
and
forces
the
road
to
make
a
considerable
circuit
over
the
uplands
this
presented
an
escarpment
on
the
river
of
about
nine
hundred
yards
in
length
and
is
familiarly
known
as
scott
bluffs
we
had
made
a
journey
of
thirty
miles
before
we
again
struck
the
river
at
a
place
where
some
scanty
grass
afforded
an
insufficient
pasturage
to
our
animals
about
twenty
miles
from
the
chimney
rock
we
had
found
a
very
beautiful
spring
of
excellent
and
cold
water
but
it
was
in
such
a
deep
ravine
and
so
small
that
the
animals
could
not
profit
by
it
and
we
therefore
halted
only
a
few
minutes
and
found
a
ten
miles
further
on
the
plain
between
scott
bluffs
and
chimney
rock
was
almost
entirely
covered
with
consisting
principally
of
cedar
which
we
were
informed
had
been
supplied
from
the
black
hills
in
a
flood
five
or
six
years
since
nine
miles
from
our
encampment
of
yesterday
we
crossed
horse
creek
a
shallow
stream
of
clear
water
about
seventy
yards
wide
falling
into
the
platte
on
the
right
bank
it
was
lightly
timbered
and
great
quantities
of
were
piled
up
on
the
banks
appearing
to
be
supplied
by
the
creek
from
above
after
a
journey
of
miles
we
encamped
on
a
rich
bottom
which
afforded
fine
grass
to
our
animals
buffalo
have
entirely
disappeared
and
we
live
now
upon
the
dried
meat
which
is
exceedingly
poor
food
the
marl
and
earthy
limestone
which
constituted
the
formation
for
several
days
past
had
changed
during
the
day
into
a
compact
white
or
limestone
sometimes
containing
hornstone
and
at
the
place
of
our
encampment
this
evening
some
strata
in
the
river
hills
cropped
out
to
the
height
of
thirty
or
forty
feet
consisting
of
granitic
sandstone
one
of
the
strata
closely
resembling
gneiss
about
four
we
reached
fort
laramie
where
we
were
cordially
received
we
pitched
our
camp
a
little
above
the
fort
on
the
bank
of
the
laramie
river
in
which
the
pure
and
clear
water
of
the
mountain
stream
looked
refreshingly
cool
and
made
a
pleasant
contrast
to
the
muddy
yellow
waters
of
the
platte
i
walked
up
to
visit
our
friends
at
the
fort
which
is
a
quadrangular
structure
built
of
clay
after
the
fashion
of
the
mexicans
who
are
generally
employed
in
building
them
the
walls
are
about
fifteen
feet
high
surmounted
with
a
wooden
palisade
and
form
a
portion
of
ranges
of
houses
which
entirely
surround
a
yard
of
about
one
hundred
and
thirty
feet
square
every
apartment
has
its
door
and
window
all
of
course
opening
on
the
inside
there
are
two
entrances
opposite
each
other
and
midway
the
wall
one
of
which
is
a
large
and
public
entrance
the
other
smaller
and
more
private
a
sort
of
postern
gate
over
the
great
entrance
is
a
square
tower
with
loopholes
and
like
the
rest
of
the
work
built
of
earth
at
two
of
the
angles
and
diagonally
opposite
each
other
are
large
square
bastions
so
arranged
as
to
sweep
the
four
faces
of
the
walls
this
post
belongs
to
the
american
fur
company
and
at
the
time
of
our
visit
was
in
charge
of
boudeau
two
of
the
company
clerks
galpin
and
kellogg
were
with
him
and
he
had
in
the
fort
about
sixteen
men
as
usual
these
had
found
wives
among
the
indian
squaws
and
with
the
usual
accompaniment
of
children
the
place
had
quite
a
populous
appearance
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
the
object
of
the
establishment
is
trade
with
the
neighboring
tribes
who
in
the
course
of
the
year
generally
make
two
or
three
visits
to
the
fort
in
addition
to
this
traders
with
a
small
outfit
are
constantly
kept
amongst
them
the
articles
of
trade
consist
on
the
one
side
almost
entirely
of
buffalo
robes
and
on
the
other
of
blankets
calicoes
guns
powder
and
lead
with
such
cheap
ornaments
as
glass
beads
rings
vermilion
for
painting
tobacco
and
principally
and
in
spite
of
the
prohibition
of
spirits
brought
into
the
country
in
the
form
of
alcohol
and
diluted
with
water
before
sold
while
mentioning
this
fact
it
is
but
justice
to
the
american
fur
company
to
state
that
throughout
the
country
i
have
always
found
them
strenuously
opposed
to
the
introduction
of
spirituous
liquors
but
in
the
present
state
of
things
when
the
country
is
supplied
with
alcohol
when
a
keg
of
it
will
purchase
from
an
indian
every
thing
he
possesses
his
furs
his
lodge
his
horses
and
even
his
wife
and
children
and
when
any
vagabond
who
has
money
enough
to
purchase
a
mule
can
go
into
a
village
and
trade
against
them
successfully
without
withdrawing
entirely
from
the
trade
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
discontinue
its
use
in
their
opposition
to
this
practice
the
company
is
sustained
not
only
by
their
obligation
to
the
laws
of
the
country
and
the
welfare
of
the
indians
but
clearly
also
on
grounds
of
policy
for
with
heavy
and
expensive
outfits
they
contend
at
manifestly
great
disadvantage
against
the
numerous
independent
and
unlicensed
traders
who
enter
the
country
from
various
avenues
from
the
united
states
and
from
mexico
having
no
other
stock
in
trade
than
some
kegs
of
liquor
which
they
sell
at
the
modest
price
of
dollars
per
gallon
the
difference
between
the
regular
trader
and
the
des
as
the
french
call
the
itinerant
or
peddling
traders
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
spirits
is
here
as
it
always
has
been
fixed
and
permanent
and
growing
out
of
the
nature
of
their
trade
the
regular
trader
looks
ahead
and
has
an
interest
in
the
preservation
of
the
indians
and
in
the
regular
pursuit
of
their
business
and
the
preservation
of
their
arms
horses
and
every
thing
necessary
to
their
future
and
permanent
success
in
hunting
the
des
has
no
permanent
interest
and
gets
what
he
can
and
for
what
he
can
from
every
indian
he
meets
even
at
the
risk
of
disabling
him
from
doing
any
thing
more
at
hunting
the
fort
had
a
very
cool
and
clean
appearance
the
great
entrance
in
which
i
found
the
gentlemen
assembled
and
which
was
floored
and
about
fifteen
feet
long
made
a
pleasant
shaded
seat
through
which
the
breeze
swept
constantly
for
this
country
is
famous
for
high
winds
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
i
learned
the
following
particulars
which
will
explain
the
condition
of
the
country
for
several
years
the
cheyennes
and
sioux
had
gradually
become
more
and
more
hostile
to
the
whites
and
in
the
latter
part
of
august
had
had
a
rather
severe
engagement
with
a
party
of
sixty
men
under
the
command
of
frapp
of
louis
the
indians
lost
eight
or
ten
warriors
and
the
whites
had
their
leader
and
four
men
killed
this
fight
took
place
on
the
waters
of
snake
river
and
it
was
this
party
on
their
return
under
bridger
which
had
spread
so
much
alarm
among
my
people
in
the
course
of
the
spring
two
other
small
parties
had
been
cut
off
by
the
sioux
one
on
their
return
from
the
crow
nation
and
the
other
among
the
black
hills
the
emigrants
to
oregon
and
bridger
party
met
here
a
few
days
before
our
arrival
divisions
and
misunderstandings
had
grown
up
among
them
they
were
already
somewhat
disheartened
by
the
fatigue
of
their
long
and
wearisome
journey
and
the
feet
of
their
cattle
had
become
so
much
worn
as
to
be
scarcely
able
to
travel
in
this
situation
they
were
not
likely
to
find
encouragement
in
the
hostile
attitude
of
the
indians
and
the
new
and
unexpected
difficulties
which
sprang
up
before
them
they
were
told
that
the
country
was
entirely
swept
of
grass
and
that
few
or
no
buffalo
were
to
be
found
on
their
line
of
route
and
with
their
weakened
animals
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
transport
their
heavy
wagons
over
the
mountains
under
these
circumstances
they
disposed
of
their
wagons
and
cattle
at
the
forts
selling
them
at
the
prices
they
had
paid
in
the
states
and
taking
in
exchange
coffee
and
sugar
at
one
dollar
a
pound
and
miserable
horses
which
died
before
they
reached
the
mountains
boudeau
informed
me
that
he
had
purchased
thirty
and
the
lower
fort
eighty
head
of
fine
cattle
some
of
them
of
the
durham
breed
fitzpatrick
whose
name
and
high
reputation
are
familiar
to
all
who
interest
themselves
in
the
history
of
this
country
had
reached
laramie
in
company
with
bridger
and
the
emigrants
were
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
his
services
to
guide
them
as
far
as
the
british
post
of
fort
hall
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
beyond
the
south
pass
of
the
mountains
they
had
started
for
this
post
on
the
of
july
and
immediately
after
their
departure
a
war
party
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
braves
set
out
upon
their
trail
as
their
principal
chief
or
partisan
had
lost
some
relations
in
the
recent
fight
and
had
sworn
to
kill
the
first
whites
on
his
path
it
was
supposed
that
their
intention
was
to
attack
the
party
should
a
favorable
opportunity
offer
or
if
they
were
foiled
in
their
principal
object
by
the
vigilance
of
fitzpatrick
content
themselves
with
stealing
horses
and
cutting
off
stragglers
these
had
been
gone
but
a
few
days
previous
to
our
arrival
the
effect
of
the
engagement
with
frapp
had
been
greatly
to
irritate
the
hostile
spirit
of
the
savages
and
immediately
subsequent
to
that
event
the
gross
ventre
indians
had
united
with
the
oglallahs
and
cheyennes
and
taken
the
field
in
great
force
so
far
as
i
could
ascertain
to
the
amount
of
eight
hundred
lodges
their
object
was
to
make
an
attack
on
a
camp
of
snake
and
crow
indians
and
a
body
of
about
one
hundred
whites
who
had
made
a
rendezvous
somewhere
in
the
green
river
valley
or
on
the
sweet
water
after
spending
some
time
in
buffalo
hunting
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
medicine
bow
mountain
they
were
to
cross
over
to
the
green
river
waters
and
return
to
laramie
by
way
of
the
south
pass
and
the
sweet
water
valley
according
to
the
calculation
of
the
indians
boudeau
informed
me
they
were
somewhere
near
the
head
of
the
sweet
water
i
subsequently
learned
that
the
party
led
by
fitzpatrick
were
overtaken
by
their
pursuers
near
rock
independence
in
the
valley
of
the
sweet
water
but
his
skill
and
resolution
saved
them
from
surprise
and
small
as
his
force
was
they
did
not
venture
to
attack
him
openly
here
they
lost
one
of
their
party
by
an
accident
and
continuing
up
the
valley
they
came
suddenly
upon
the
large
village
from
these
they
met
with
a
doubtful
reception
long
residence
and
familiar
acquaintance
had
given
to
fitzpatrick
great
personal
influence
among
them
and
a
portion
of
them
were
disposed
to
let
him
pass
quietly
but
by
far
the
greater
number
were
inclined
to
hostile
measures
and
the
chiefs
spent
the
whole
of
one
night
during
which
they
kept
the
little
party
in
the
midst
of
them
in
council
debating
the
question
of
attacking
them
the
next
day
but
the
influence
of
the
broken
hand
as
they
called
fitzpatrick
one
of
his
hands
having
been
shattered
by
the
bursting
of
a
gun
at
length
prevailed
and
obtained
for
them
an
unmolested
passage
but
they
sternly
assured
him
that
this
path
was
no
longer
open
and
that
any
party
of
the
whites
which
should
hereafter
be
found
upon
it
would
meet
with
certain
destruction
from
all
that
i
have
been
able
to
learn
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
emigrants
owe
their
lives
to
fitzpatrick
thus
it
would
appear
that
the
country
was
swarming
with
scattered
war
parties
and
when
i
heard
during
the
day
the
various
contradictory
and
exaggerated
rumors
which
were
incessantly
repeated
to
them
i
was
not
surprised
that
so
much
alarm
prevailed
among
my
men
carson
one
of
the
best
and
most
experienced
mountaineers
fully
supported
the
opinion
given
by
bridger
of
the
dangerous
state
of
the
country
and
openly
expressed
his
conviction
that
we
could
not
escape
without
some
sharp
encounters
with
the
indians
in
addition
to
this
he
made
his
will
and
among
the
circumstances
which
were
constantly
occurring
to
increase
their
alarm
this
was
the
most
unfortunate
and
i
found
that
a
number
of
my
party
had
become
so
much
intimidated
that
they
had
requested
to
be
discharged
at
this
place
i
dined
at
fort
platte
which
has
been
mentioned
as
situated
at
the
junction
of
laramie
river
with
the
nebraska
here
i
heard
a
confirmation
of
the
statements
given
above
the
party
of
warriors
which
had
started
a
few
days
since
on
the
trail
of
the
emigrants
was
expected
back
in
fourteen
days
to
join
the
village
with
which
their
families
and
the
old
men
had
remained
the
arrival
of
the
latter
was
hourly
expected
and
some
indians
have
just
come
in
who
had
left
them
on
the
laramie
fork
about
twenty
miles
above
bissonette
one
of
the
traders
belonging
to
fort
platte
urged
the
propriety
of
taking
with
me
an
interpreter
and
two
or
three
old
men
of
the
village
in
which
case
he
thought
there
would
be
little
or
no
hazard
in
encountering
any
of
the
war
parties
the
principal
danger
was
in
being
attacked
before
they
should
know
who
we
were
they
had
a
confused
idea
of
the
numbers
and
power
of
our
people
and
dreaded
to
bring
upon
themselves
the
military
force
of
the
united
states
this
gentleman
who
spoke
the
language
fluently
offered
his
services
to
accompany
me
so
far
as
the
red
buttes
he
was
desirous
to
join
the
large
party
on
its
return
for
purposes
of
trade
and
it
would
suit
his
views
as
well
as
my
own
to
go
with
us
to
the
buttes
beyond
which
point
it
would
be
impossible
to
prevail
on
a
sioux
to
venture
on
account
of
their
fear
of
the
crows
from
fort
laramie
to
the
red
buttes
by
the
ordinary
road
is
one
hundred
and
miles
and
though
only
on
the
threshold
of
danger
it
seemed
better
to
secure
the
services
of
an
interpreter
for
the
partial
distance
than
to
have
none
at
all
so
far
as
frequent
interruption
from
the
indians
would
allow
we
occupied
ourselves
in
making
some
astronomical
calculations
and
bringing
the
general
map
to
this
stage
of
our
journey
but
the
tent
was
generally
occupied
by
a
succession
of
our
ceremonious
visitors
some
came
for
presents
and
others
for
information
of
our
object
in
coming
to
the
country
now
and
then
one
would
dart
up
to
the
tent
on
horseback
jerk
off
his
trappings
and
stand
silently
at
the
door
holding
his
horse
by
the
halter
signifying
his
desire
to
trade
occasionally
a
savage
would
stalk
in
with
an
invitation
to
a
feast
of
honor
a
dog
feast
and
deliberately
sit
down
and
wait
quietly
until
i
was
ready
to
accompany
him
i
went
to
one
the
women
and
children
were
sitting
outside
the
lodge
and
we
took
our
seats
on
buffalo
robes
spread
around
the
dog
was
in
a
large
pot
over
the
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
lodge
and
immediately
on
our
arrival
was
dished
up
in
large
wooden
bowls
one
of
which
was
handed
to
each
the
flesh
appeared
very
glutinous
with
something
of
the
flavor
and
appearance
of
mutton
feeling
something
move
behind
me
i
looked
round
and
found
that
i
had
taken
my
seat
among
a
litter
of
fat
young
puppies
had
i
been
nice
in
such
matters
the
prejudices
of
civilization
might
have
interfered
with
my
tranquillity
but
fortunately
i
am
not
of
delicate
nerves
and
continued
quietly
to
empty
my
platter
the
weather
was
cloudy
at
evening
with
a
moderate
south
wind
and
the
thermometer
at
six
i
was
disappointed
in
my
hope
of
obtaining
an
observation
of
an
occultation
which
took
place
about
midnight
the
moon
brought
with
her
heavy
banks
of
clouds
through
which
she
scarcely
made
her
appearance
during
the
night
the
morning
of
the
was
cloudy
and
calm
the
thermometer
at
six
at
about
nine
with
a
moderate
wind
from
the
west
a
storm
of
rain
came
on
accompanied
by
sharp
thunder
and
lightning
which
lasted
about
an
hour
during
the
day
the
expected
village
arrived
consisting
principally
of
old
men
women
and
children
they
had
a
considerable
number
of
horses
and
large
troops
of
dogs
their
lodges
were
pitched
near
the
fort
and
our
camp
was
constantly
crowded
with
indians
of
all
sizes
from
morning
until
night
at
which
time
some
of
the
soldiers
generally
came
to
drive
them
all
off
to
the
village
my
tent
was
the
only
place
which
they
respected
here
only
came
the
chiefs
and
men
of
distinction
and
generally
one
of
them
remained
to
drive
away
the
women
and
children
the
numerous
strange
instruments
applied
to
still
stranger
uses
excited
awe
and
admiration
among
them
and
those
which
i
used
in
talking
with
the
sun
and
stars
they
looked
upon
with
especial
reverence
as
mysterious
things
of
great
medicine
of
the
three
barometers
which
i
had
brought
with
me
thus
far
successfully
i
found
that
two
were
out
of
order
and
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
in
repairing
them
an
operation
of
no
small
difficulty
in
the
midst
of
the
incessant
interruptions
to
which
i
was
subjected
we
had
the
misfortune
to
break
here
a
large
thermometer
graduated
to
show
fifths
of
a
degree
which
i
used
to
ascertain
the
temperature
of
boiling
water
and
with
which
i
had
promised
myself
some
interesting
experiments
in
the
mountains
we
had
but
one
remaining
on
which
the
graduation
extended
sufficiently
high
and
this
was
too
small
for
exact
observations
during
our
stay
here
the
men
had
been
engaged
in
making
numerous
repairs
arranging
and
otherwise
preparing
for
the
chance
of
a
rough
road
and
mountain
travel
all
things
of
this
nature
being
ready
i
gathered
them
around
me
in
the
evening
and
told
them
that
i
had
determined
to
proceed
the
next
day
they
were
all
well
armed
i
had
engaged
the
services
of
bissonette
as
interpreter
and
had
taken
in
the
circumstances
every
possible
means
to
ensure
our
safety
in
the
rumors
we
had
heard
i
believed
there
was
much
exaggeration
that
they
were
men
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
life
and
to
the
country
and
that
these
were
the
dangers
of
occurrence
and
to
be
expected
in
the
ordinary
course
of
their
service
they
had
heard
of
the
unsettled
condition
of
the
country
before
leaving
louis
and
therefore
could
not
make
it
a
reason
for
breaking
their
engagements
still
i
was
unwilling
to
take
with
me
on
a
service
of
some
certain
danger
men
on
whom
i
could
not
rely
and
i
had
understood
that
there
were
among
them
some
who
were
disposed
to
cowardice
and
anxious
to
return
they
had
but
to
come
forward
at
once
and
state
their
desire
and
they
would
be
discharged
with
the
amount
due
to
them
for
the
time
they
had
served
to
their
honor
be
it
said
there
was
but
one
among
them
who
had
the
face
to
come
forward
and
avail
himself
of
the
permission
i
asked
him
some
few
questions
in
order
to
expose
him
to
the
ridicule
of
the
men
and
let
him
go
the
day
after
our
departure
he
engaged
himself
to
one
of
the
forts
and
set
off
with
a
party
to
the
upper
missouri
i
did
not
think
that
the
situation
of
the
country
justified
me
in
taking
our
young
companions
brant
and
benton
along
with
us
in
case
of
misfortune
it
would
have
been
thought
at
the
least
an
act
of
great
imprudence
and
therefore
though
reluctantly
i
determined
to
leave
them
randolph
had
been
the
life
of
the
camp
and
the
was
much
regretted
by
the
men
to
whom
his
buoyant
spirits
had
afforded
great
amusement
they
all
however
agreed
in
the
propriety
of
leaving
him
at
the
fort
because
as
they
said
he
might
cost
the
lives
of
some
of
the
men
in
a
fight
with
the
indians
a
portion
of
our
baggage
with
our
and
observations
and
several
instruments
were
left
at
the
fort
one
of
the
gentlemen
galpin
took
charge
of
a
barometer
which
he
engaged
to
observe
during
my
absence
and
i
in
trusted
to
randolph
by
way
of
occupation
the
regular
winding
up
of
two
of
my
chronometers
which
were
among
the
instruments
left
our
observations
showed
that
the
chronometer
which
i
retained
for
the
continuation
of
our
voyage
had
preserved
its
rate
in
a
most
satisfactory
manner
as
deduced
from
it
the
longitude
of
fort
laramie
is
and
from
lunar
distance
giving
for
the
adopted
longitude
comparing
the
barometrical
observations
made
during
our
stay
here
with
those
of
engleman
at
louis
we
find
for
the
elevation
of
the
fort
above
the
gulf
of
mexico
feet
the
winter
climate
here
is
remarkably
mild
for
the
latitude
but
rainy
weather
is
frequent
and
the
place
is
celebrated
for
winds
of
which
the
prevailing
one
is
the
west
an
east
wind
in
summer
and
a
south
wind
in
winter
are
said
to
be
always
accompanied
with
rain
we
were
ready
to
depart
the
tents
were
struck
the
mules
geared
up
and
our
horses
saddled
and
we
walked
up
to
the
fort
to
take
the
with
our
friends
in
an
excellent
preparation
while
thus
pleasantly
engaged
seated
in
one
of
the
little
cool
chambers
at
the
door
of
which
a
man
had
been
stationed
to
prevent
all
intrusion
from
the
indians
a
number
of
chiefs
several
of
them
powerful
men
forced
their
way
into
the
room
in
spite
of
all
opposition
handing
me

not
to

which

furthermore
they

as

as

you
they
are

excuse
me
for
making
these

but
it
seems
my
duty
to
warn
you
of
danger
moreover
the
chiefs
who
prohibit
your
setting
out
before
the
return
of
the

are
the
bearers
of
this
note
i
am
your

of
some
of
the

the
breaker
of

the
black

the

after
reading
this
i
mentioned
its
purport
to
my
companions
and
seeing
that
all
were
fully
possessed
of
its
contents
one
of
the
indians
rose
up
and
having
first
shaken
hands
with
me
spoke
as
follows
you
have
come
among
us
at
a
bad
time
some
of
our
people
have
been
killed
and
our
young
men
who
are
gone
to
the
mountains
are
eager
to
avenge
the
blood
of
their
relations
which
has
been
shed
by
the
whites
our
young
men
are
bad
and
if
they
meet
you
they
will
believe
that
you
are
carrying
goods
and
ammunition
to
their
enemies
and
will
fire
upon
you
you
have
told
us
that
this
will
make
war
we
know
that
our
great
father
has
many
soldiers
and
big
guns
and
we
are
anxious
to
have
our
lives
we
love
the
whites
and
are
desirous
of
peace
thinking
of
all
these
things
we
have
determined
to
keep
you
here
until
our
warriors
return
we
are
glad
to
see
you
among
us
our
father
is
rich
and
we
expected
that
you
would
have
brought
presents
to
us
horses
guns
and
blankets
but
we
are
glad
to
see
you
we
look
upon
your
coming
as
the
light
which
goes
before
the
sun
for
you
will
tell
our
great
father
that
you
have
seen
us
and
that
we
are
naked
and
poor
and
have
nothing
to
eat
and
he
will
send
us
all
these
things
he
was
followed
by
others
to
the
same
effect
the
observations
of
the
savage
appeared
reasonable
but
i
was
aware
that
they
had
in
view
only
the
present
object
of
detaining
me
and
were
unwilling
i
should
go
further
into
the
country
in
reply
i
asked
them
through
the
interpretation
of
boudeau
to
select
two
or
three
of
their
number
to
accompany
us
until
we
should
meet
their
people
they
should
spread
their
robes
in
my
tent
and
eat
at
my
table
and
on
their
return
i
would
give
them
presents
in
reward
of
their
services
they
declined
saying
that
there
were
no
young
men
left
in
the
village
and
that
they
were
too
old
to
travel
so
many
days
on
horseback
and
preferred
now
to
smoke
their
pipes
in
the
lodge
and
let
the
warriors
go
on
the
besides
they
had
no
power
over
the
young
men
and
were
afraid
to
interfere
with
them
in
my
turn
i
addressed
them
you
say
that
you
love
the
whites
why
have
you
killed
so
many
already
this
spring
you
say
that
you
love
the
whites
and
are
full
of
many
expressions
of
friendship
to
us
but
you
are
not
willing
to
undergo
the
fatigue
of
a
few
days
ride
to
save
our
lives
we
do
not
believe
what
you
have
said
and
will
not
listen
to
you
whatever
a
chief
among
us
tells
his
soldiers
to
do
is
done
we
are
the
soldiers
of
the
great
chief
your
father
he
has
told
us
to
come
here
and
see
this
country
and
all
the
indians
his
children
why
should
we
not
go
before
we
came
we
heard
that
you
had
killed
his
people
and
ceased
to
be
his
children
but
we
came
among
you
peaceably
holding
out
our
hands
now
we
find
that
the
stories
we
heard
are
not
lies
and
that
you
are
no
longer
his
friends
and
children
we
have
thrown
away
our
bodies
and
will
not
turn
back
when
you
told
us
that
your
young
men
would
kill
us
you
did
not
know
that
our
hearts
were
strong
and
you
did
not
see
the
rifles
which
my
young
men
carry
in
their
hands
we
are
few
and
you
are
many
and
may
kill
us
all
but
there
will
be
much
crying
in
your
villages
for
many
of
your
young
men
will
stay
behind
and
forget
to
return
with
your
warriors
from
the
mountains
do
you
think
that
our
great
chief
will
let
his
soldiers
die
and
forget
to
cover
their
graves
before
the
snows
melt
again
his
warriors
will
sweep
away
your
villages
as
the
fire
does
the
prairie
in
the
autumn
see
i
have
pulled
down
my
and
my
people
are
ready
when
the
sun
is
ten
paces
higher
we
shall
be
on
the
march
if
you
have
any
thing
to
tell
us
you
will
say
it
soon
i
broke
up
the
conference
as
i
could
do
nothing
with
these
people
and
being
resolved
to
proceed
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
delay
accompanied
by
our
hospitable
friends
we
returned
to
the
camp
we
had
mounted
our
horses
and
our
parting
salutations
had
been
exchanged
when
one
of
the
chiefs
the
bull
tail
arrived
to
tell
me
that
they
had
determined
to
send
a
young
man
with
us
and
if
i
would
point
out
the
place
of
our
evening
camp
he
should
join
us
there
the
young
man
is
poor
said
he
he
has
no
horse
and
expects
you
to
give
him
one
i
described
to
him
the
place
where
i
intended
to
encamp
and
shaking
hands
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
among
the
hills
and
this
last
habitation
of
whites
shut
out
from
our
view
the
road
led
over
an
interesting
plateau
between
the
north
fork
of
the
platte
on
the
right
and
laramie
river
on
the
left
at
the
distance
of
ten
miles
from
the
fort
we
entered
the
sandy
bed
of
a
creek
a
kind
of
defile
shaded
by
precipitous
rocks
down
which
we
wound
our
way
for
several
hundred
yards
to
a
place
where
on
the
left
bank
a
very
large
spring
gushes
with
considerable
noise
and
force
out
of
the
limestone
rock
it
is
called
the
warm
spring
and
furnishes
to
the
hitherto
dry
bed
of
the
creek
a
considerable
rivulet
on
the
opposite
side
a
little
below
the
spring
is
a
lofty
limestone
escarpment
partially
shaded
by
a
grove
of
large
trees
whose
green
foliage
in
contrast
with
the
whiteness
of
the
rock
renders
this
a
picturesque
locality
the
rock
is
fossiliferous
and
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
determine
the
character
of
the
fossils
belongs
to
the
carboniferous
limestone
of
the
missouri
river
and
is
probably
the
western
limit
of
that
formation
beyond
this
point
i
met
with
no
fossils
of
any
description
i
was
desirous
to
visit
the
platte
near
the
point
where
it
leaves
the
black
hills
and
therefore
followed
this
stream
for
two
or
three
miles
to
its
mouth
where
i
encamped
on
a
spot
which
afforded
good
grass
and
equisetum
for
our
animals
our
tents
having
been
found
too
thin
to
protect
ourselves
and
the
instruments
from
the
rains
which
in
this
elevated
country
are
attended
with
cold
and
unpleasant
weather
i
had
procured
from
the
indians
at
laramie
a
tolerably
large
lodge
about
eighteen
feet
in
diameter
and
twenty
feet
in
height
such
a
lodge
when
properly
pitched
is
from
its
conical
form
almost
perfectly
secure
against
the
violent
winds
which
are
frequent
in
this
region
and
with
a
fire
in
the
centre
is
a
dry
and
warm
shelter
in
bad
weather
by
raising
the
lower
part
so
as
to
permit
the
breeze
to
pass
freely
it
is
converted
into
a
pleasant
summer
residence
with
the
extraordinary
advantage
of
being
entirely
free
from
musquitoes
one
of
which
i
never
saw
in
an
indian
lodge
while
we
were
engaged
very
unskilfully
in
erecting
this
the
interpreter
bissonette
arrived
accompanied
by
the
indian
and
his
wife
she
laughed
at
our
awkwardness
and
offered
her
assistance
of
which
we
were
frequently
afterwards
obliged
to
avail
our
selves
before
the
men
acquired
sufficient
expertness
to
pitch
it
without
difficulty
from
this
place
we
had
a
fine
view
of
the
gorge
where
the
platte
issues
from
the
black
hills
changing
its
character
abruptly
from
a
mountain
stream
into
a
river
of
the
plains
immediately
around
us
the
valley
of
the
stream
was
tolerably
open
and
at
the
distance
of
a
few
miles
where
the
river
had
cut
its
way
through
the
hills
was
the
narrow
cleft
on
one
side
of
which
a
lofty
precipice
of
bright
red
rock
rose
vertically
above
the
low
hills
which
lay
between
us
in
the
morning
while
breakfast
was
being
prepared
i
visited
this
place
with
my
favorite
man
basil
lajeunesse
entering
so
far
as
there
was
footing
for
the
mules
we
dismounted
and
tying
our
animals
continued
our
way
on
foot
like
the
whole
country
the
scenery
of
the
river
had
undergone
an
entire
change
and
was
in
this
place
the
most
beautiful
i
have
ever
seen
the
breadth
of
the
stream
generally
near
that
of
its
valley
was
from
two
to
three
hundred
feet
with
a
swift
current
occasionally
broken
by
rapids
and
the
water
perfectly
clear
on
either
side
rose
the
red
precipices
and
sometimes
overhanging
two
and
four
hundred
feet
in
height
crowned
with
green
summits
on
which
were
scattered
a
few
pines
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
was
the
usual
detritus
formed
of
masses
fallen
from
above
among
the
pines
that
grew
here
and
on
the
occasional
banks
were
the
cherry
currants
and
grains
de
boeuf
viewed
in
the
sunshine
of
a
pleasant
morning
the
scenery
was
of
a
most
striking
and
romantic
beauty
which
arose
from
the
picturesque
disposition
of
the
objects
and
the
vivid
contrast
of
colors
i
thought
with
much
pleasure
of
our
approaching
descent
in
the
canoe
through
such
interesting
places
and
in
the
expectation
of
being
able
at
that
time
to
give
to
them
a
full
examination
did
not
now
dwell
so
much
as
might
have
been
desirable
upon
the
geological
formations
along
the
line
of
the
river
where
they
are
developed
with
great
clearness
the
upper
portion
of
the
red
strata
consists
of
very
compact
clay
in
which
are
occasionally
seen
imbedded
large
pebbles
below
was
a
stratum
of
compact
red
sandstone
changing
a
little
above
the
river
into
a
very
hard
silicious
limestone
there
is
a
small
but
handsome
open
prairie
immediately
below
this
place
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
which
would
be
a
good
locality
for
a
military
post
there
are
some
open
groves
of
cottonwood
on
the
platte
the
small
stream
which
comes
in
at
this
place
is
well
timbered
with
pine
and
good
building
rock
is
abundant
if
it
is
in
contemplation
to
keep
open
the
communication
with
oregon
territory
a
show
of
military
force
in
this
country
is
absolutely
necessary
and
a
combination
of
advantages
renders
the
neighborhood
of
fort
laramie
the
most
suitable
place
on
the
line
of
the
platte
for
the
establishment
of
a
military
post
it
is
connected
with
the
mouth
of
the
platte
and
the
upper
missouri
by
excellent
roads
which
are
in
frequent
use
and
would
not
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
range
of
the
buffalo
on
which
the
neighboring
indians
mainly
depend
for
support
it
would
render
any
posts
on
the
lower
platte
unnecessary
the
ordinary
communication
between
it
and
the
missouri
being
sufficient
to
control
the
intermediate
indians
it
would
operate
effectually
to
prevent
any
such
coalitions
as
are
now
formed
among
the
gros
ventres
sioux
cheyennes
and
other
indians
and
would
keep
the
oregon
road
through
the
valley
of
the
sweet
water
and
the
south
pass
of
the
mountains
constantly
open
it
lies
at
the
foot
of
a
broken
and
mountainous
region
along
which
by
the
establishment
of
small
posts
in
the
neighborhood
of
vrain
fort
on
the
south
fork
of
the
platte
and
bent
fort
on
the
arkansas
a
line
of
communication
would
be
formed
by
good
with
our
southern
military
posts
which
would
entirely
command
the
mountain
passes
hold
some
of
the
most
troublesome
tribes
in
check
and
protect
and
facilitate
our
intercourse
with
the
neighboring
spanish
settlements
the
valleys
of
the
rivers
on
which
they
would
be
situated
are
fertile
the
country
which
supports
immense
herds
of
buffalo
is
admirably
adapted
to
grazing
and
herds
of
cattle
might
be
maintained
by
the
posts
or
obtained
from
the
spanish
country
which
already
supplies
a
portion
of
their
provisions
to
the
trading
posts
mentioned
above
just
as
we
were
leaving
the
camp
this
morning
our
indian
came
up
and
stated
his
intention
of
not
proceeding
any
further
until
he
had
seen
the
horse
which
i
intended
to
give
him
i
felt
strongly
tempted
to
drive
him
out
of
the
camp
but
his
presence
appeared
to
give
confidence
to
my
men
and
the
interpreter
thought
it
absolutely
necessary
i
was
therefore
obliged
to
do
what
he
requested
and
pointed
out
the
animal
with
which
he
seemed
satisfied
and
we
continued
our
journey
i
had
imagined
that
bissonette
long
residence
had
made
him
acquainted
with
the
country
and
according
to
his
advice
proceeded
directly
forward
without
attempting
to
gain
the
usual
road
he
afterwards
informed
me
that
he
had
rarely
ever
lost
sight
of
the
fort
but
the
effect
of
the
mistake
was
to
involve
us
for
a
day
or
two
among
the
hills
where
although
we
lost
no
time
we
encountered
an
exceedingly
rough
road
to
the
south
along
our
line
of
march
the
main
chain
of
the
black
or
laramie
hills
rises
precipitously
time
did
not
permit
me
to
visit
them
but
from
comparative
information
the
ridge
is
composed
of
the
coarse
sandstone
or
conglomerate
hereafter
described
it
appears
to
enter
the
region
of
clouds
which
are
arrested
in
their
course
and
lie
in
masses
along
the
summits
an
inverted
cone
of
black
cloud
cumulus
rested
during
all
the
forenoon
on
the
lofty
peak
of
laramie
mountain
which
i
estimated
to
be
about
two
thousand
feet
above
the
fort
or
six
thousand
five
hundred
above
the
sea
we
halted
to
noon
on
the
so
called
from
being
timbered
principally
with
the
a
species
of
poplar
with
which
the
valley
of
the
little
stream
is
tolerably
well
wooded
and
which
with
large
expansive
summits
grows
to
the
height
of
sixty
or
seventy
feet
the
bed
of
the
creek
is
sand
and
gravel
the
water
dispersed
over
the
broad
bed
in
several
shallow
streams
we
found
here
on
the
right
bank
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
a
fine
spring
of
very
cold
water
it
will
be
remarked
that
i
do
not
mention
in
this
portion
of
the
journey
the
temperature
of
the
air
sand
springs
an
omission
which
will
be
explained
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
in
my
search
for
plants
i
was
well
rewarded
at
this
place
with
the
change
in
the
geological
formation
on
leaving
fort
laramie
the
whole
face
of
the
country
has
entirely
altered
its
appearance
eastward
of
that
meridian
the
principal
objects
which
strike
the
eye
of
a
traveler
are
the
absence
of
timber
and
the
immense
expanse
of
prairie
covered
with
the
verdure
of
rich
grasses
and
highly
adapted
for
pasturage
wherever
they
are
not
disturbed
by
the
vicinity
of
man
large
herds
of
buffalo
give
animation
to
this
country
westward
of
laramie
river
the
region
is
sandy
and
apparently
sterile
and
the
place
of
the
grass
is
usurped
by
the
and
other
odoriferous
plants
to
whose
growth
the
sandy
soil
and
dry
air
of
this
elevated
region
seem
highly
favorable
one
of
the
prominent
characteristics
in
the
face
of
the
country
is
the
extraordinary
abundance
of
the
they
grow
everywhere
on
the
hills
and
over
the
river
bottoms
in
tough
twisted
wiry
clumps
and
wherever
the
beaten
track
was
left
they
rendered
the
progress
of
the
carts
rough
and
slow
as
the
country
increased
in
elevation
on
our
advance
to
the
west
they
increased
in
size
and
the
whole
air
is
strongly
impregnated
and
saturated
with
the
odor
of
camphor
and
spirits
of
turpentine
which
belongs
to
this
plant
this
climate
has
been
found
very
favorable
to
the
restoration
of
health
particularly
in
cases
of
consumption
and
possibly
the
respiration
of
air
so
highly
impregnated
with
aromatic
plants
may
have
some
influence
our
dried
meat
had
given
out
and
we
began
to
be
in
want
of
food
but
one
of
the
hunters
killed
an
antelope
this
evening
which
afforded
some
relief
although
it
did
not
go
far
among
so
many
hungry
men
at
eight
at
night
after
a
march
of
miles
we
reached
our
proposed
encampment
on
the
or
creek
here
we
found
good
grass
with
a
great
quantity
of
which
furnished
good
food
for
our
tired
animals
this
creek
is
well
timbered
principally
with
and
with
the
exception
of
deer
creek
which
we
had
not
yet
reached
is
the
largest
affluent
of
the
right
bank
between
laramie
and
the
mouth
of
the
sweet
water
the
present
year
had
been
one
of
unparalleled
drought
and
throughout
the
country
the
water
had
been
almost
dried
up
by
availing
themselves
of
the
annual
rise
the
traders
had
invariably
succeeded
in
carrying
their
furs
to
the
missouri
but
this
season
as
has
already
been
mentioned
on
both
forks
of
the
platte
they
had
entirely
failed
the
greater
number
of
the
springs
and
many
of
the
streams
which
made
halting
places
for
the
had
been
dried
up
everywhere
the
soil
looked
parched
and
burnt
the
scanty
yellow
grass
crisped
under
the
foot
and
even
the
hardest
plants
were
destroyed
by
want
of
moisture
i
think
it
necessary
to
mention
this
fact
because
to
the
rapid
evaporation
in
such
an
elevated
region
nearly
five
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
almost
wholly
unprotected
by
timber
should
be
attributed
much
of
the
sterile
appearance
of
the
country
in
the
destruction
of
vegetation
and
the
numerous
saline
efflorescences
which
covered
the
ground
such
i
afterwards
found
to
be
the
case
i
was
informed
that
the
roving
villages
of
indians
and
travelers
had
never
met
with
difficulty
in
finding
abundance
of
grass
for
their
horses
and
now
it
was
after
great
search
that
we
were
able
to
find
a
scanty
patch
of
grass
sufficient
to
keep
them
from
sinking
and
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
they
began
to
suffer
very
much
we
found
none
at
noon
and
in
the
course
of
our
search
on
the
platte
came
to
a
grove
of
cottonwood
where
some
indian
village
had
recently
encamped
boughs
of
the
cottonwood
yet
green
covered
the
ground
which
the
indians
had
cut
down
to
feed
their
horses
upon
it
is
only
in
the
winter
that
recourse
is
had
to
this
means
of
sustaining
them
and
their
resort
to
it
at
this
time
was
a
striking
evidence
of
the
state
of
the
country
we
followed
their
example
and
turned
our
horses
into
a
grove
of
young
poplars
this
began
to
present
itself
as
a
very
serious
evil
for
on
our
animals
depended
altogether
the
further
prosecution
of
our
journey
shortly
after
we
had
left
this
place
the
scouts
came
galloping
in
with
the
alarm
of
indians
we
turned
in
immediately
towards
the
river
which
here
had
a
steep
high
bank
where
we
formed
with
the
carts
a
very
close
barricade
resting
on
the
river
within
which
the
animals
were
strongly
hobbled
and
picketed
the
guns
were
discharged
and
reloaded
and
men
thrown
forward
under
cover
of
the
bank
in
the
direction
by
which
the
indians
were
expected
our
interpreter
who
with
the
indian
had
gone
to
meet
them
came
in
in
about
ten
minutes
accompanied
by
two
sioux
they
looked
sulky
and
we
could
obtain
from
them
only
some
confused
information
we
learned
that
they
belonged
to
the
party
which
had
been
on
the
trail
of
the
emigrants
whom
they
had
overtaken
at
rock
independence
on
the
sweet
water
here
the
party
had
disagreed
and
came
nigh
fighting
among
themselves
one
portion
were
desirous
of
attacking
the
whites
but
the
others
were
opposed
to
it
and
finally
they
had
broken
up
into
small
bands
and
dispersed
over
the
country
the
greatest
portion
of
them
had
gone
over
into
the
territory
of
the
crows
and
intended
to
return
by
way
of
the
wind
river
valley
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
fall
upon
some
small
parties
of
crow
indians
the
remainder
were
returning
down
the
platte
in
scattered
parties
of
ten
and
twenty
and
those
whom
we
had
encountered
belonged
to
those
who
had
advocated
an
attack
on
the
emigrants
several
of
the
men
suggested
shooting
them
on
the
spot
but
i
promptly
discountenanced
any
such
proceeding
they
further
informed
me
that
buffalo
were
very
scarce
and
little
or
no
grass
to
be
found
there
had
been
no
rain
and
innumerable
quantities
of
grasshoppers
had
destroyed
the
grass
the
insects
had
been
so
numerous
since
leaving
fort
laramie
that
the
ground
seemed
alive
with
them
and
in
walking
a
little
moving
cloud
preceded
our
footsteps
this
was
bad
news
no
grass
no
buffalo
food
for
neither
horse
nor
man
i
gave
them
some
plugs
of
tobacco
and
they
went
off
apparently
well
satisfied
to
be
clear
of
us
for
my
men
did
not
look
upon
them
very
lovingly
and
they
glanced
suspiciously
at
our
warlike
preparations
and
the
little
ring
of
rifles
which
surrounded
them
they
were
evidently
in
a
bad
humor
and
shot
one
of
their
horses
when
they
had
left
us
a
short
distance
we
continued
our
march
and
after
a
journey
of
about
miles
encamped
on
the
platte
during
the
day
i
had
occasionally
remarked
among
the
hills
the
the
bread
root
of
the
indians
the
sioux
use
this
root
very
extensively
and
i
have
frequently
met
with
it
among
them
cut
into
thin
slices
and
dried
in
the
course
of
the
evening
we
were
visited
by
six
indians
who
told
us
that
a
large
party
was
encamped
a
few
miles
above
astronomical
observations
placed
us
in
longitude
and
latitude
we
made
the
next
day
miles
and
encamped
on
the
right
bank
of
the
platte
where
a
handsome
meadow
afforded
tolerably
good
grass
there
were
the
remains
of
an
old
fort
here
thrown
up
in
some
sudden
emergency
and
on
the
opposite
side
was
a
picturesque
bluff
of
ferruginous
sandstone
there
was
a
handsome
grove
a
little
above
and
scattered
groups
of
trees
bordered
the
river
buffalo
made
their
appearance
this
afternoon
and
the
hunters
came
in
shortly
after
we
had
encamped
with
three
fine
cows
the
night
was
fine
and
observations
gave
for
the
latitude
of
the
camp
we
made
but
thirteen
miles
this
day
and
encamped
about
noon
in
a
pleasant
grove
on
the
right
bank
low
scaffolds
were
erected
upon
which
the
meat
was
laid
cut
up
into
thin
strips
and
small
fires
kindled
below
our
object
was
to
profit
by
the
vicinity
of
the
buffalo
to
lay
in
a
stock
of
provisions
for
ten
or
fifteen
days
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
the
hunters
brought
in
five
or
six
cows
and
all
hands
were
kept
busily
employed
in
preparing
the
meat
to
the
drying
of
which
the
guard
attended
during
the
night
our
people
had
recovered
their
gayety
and
the
busy
figures
around
the
blazing
fires
gave
a
picturesque
air
to
the
camp
a
very
serious
accident
occurred
this
morning
in
the
breaking
of
one
of
the
barometers
these
had
been
the
object
of
my
constant
solicitude
and
as
i
had
intended
them
principally
for
mountain
service
i
had
used
them
as
seldom
as
possible
taking
them
always
down
at
night
and
on
the
occurrence
of
storms
in
order
to
lessen
the
chances
of
being
broken
i
was
reduced
to
one
a
standard
barometer
of
troughton
construction
this
i
determined
to
preserve
if
possible
the
latitude
is
and
by
a
mean
of
the
results
from
chronometer
and
lunar
distances
the
adopted
longitude
of
this
camp
is
early
this
morning
we
were
again
in
motion
we
had
a
stock
of
provisions
for
fifteen
days
carefully
stored
away
in
the
carts
and
this
i
resolved
should
only
be
encroached
upon
when
our
rifles
should
fail
to
procure
us
present
support
i
determined
to
reach
the
mountains
if
it
were
in
any
way
possible
in
the
mean
time
buffalo
were
plenty
in
six
miles
from
our
encampment
which
by
way
of
distinction
we
shall
call
dried
meat
camp
we
crossed
a
handsome
stream
called
fourche
it
is
well
timbered
and
among
the
flowers
in
bloom
on
its
banks
i
remarked
several
five
miles
further
we
made
our
noon
halt
on
the
banks
of
the
platte
in
the
shade
of
some
cottonwoods
there
were
here
as
generally
now
along
the
river
thickets
of
the
de
of
the
country
they
were
of
two
kinds
one
bearing
a
red
berry
the
of
nuttall
the
other
a
yellow
berry
of
which
the
tartars
are
said
to
make
a
kind
of
rob
by
a
meridian
observation
the
latitude
of
the
place
was
it
was
my
daily
practice
to
take
observations
of
the
sun
meridian
altitude
and
why
they
are
not
given
will
appear
in
the
sequel
eight
miles
further
we
reached
the
mouth
of
deer
creek
where
we
encamped
here
was
abundance
of
rich
grass
and
our
animals
were
compensated
for
past
privations
this
stream
was
at
this
time
twenty
feet
broad
and
well
timbered
with
cottonwood
of
an
uncommon
size
it
is
the
largest
tributary
of
the
platte
between
the
mouth
of
the
sweet
water
and
the
laramie
our
astronomical
observations
gave
for
the
mouth
of
the
stream
a
longitude
of
and
latitude
nothing
worthy
of
mention
occurred
on
this
day
we
traveled
later
than
usual
having
spent
some
time
searching
for
grass
crossing
and
recrossing
the
river
before
we
could
find
a
sufficient
quantity
for
our
animals
towards
dusk
we
encamped
among
some
artemisia
bushes
two
and
three
feet
in
height
where
some
scattered
patches
of
short
tough
grass
afforded
a
scanty
supply
in
crossing
we
had
occasion
to
observe
that
the
river
was
frequently
too
deep
to
be
forded
though
we
always
succeeded
in
finding
a
place
where
the
water
did
not
enter
the
carts
the
stream
continued
very
clear
with
two
or
three
hundred
feet
breadth
of
water
and
the
sandy
bed
and
banks
were
frequently
covered
with
large
round
pebbles
we
had
traveled
this
day
miles
the
main
chain
of
the
black
hills
was
here
only
about
seven
miles
to
the
south
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
rising
abruptly
to
the
height
of
eight
and
twelve
hundred
feet
patches
of
green
grass
in
the
ravines
on
the
steep
sides
marked
the
presence
of
springs
and
the
summits
were
clad
with
pines
in
two
miles
from
our
encampment
we
reached
the
place
where
the
regular
road
crosses
the
platte
there
was
two
hundred
feet
breadth
of
water
at
this
time
in
the
bed
which
has
a
variable
width
of
eight
to
fifteen
hundred
feet
the
channels
were
generally
three
feet
deep
and
there
were
large
angular
rocks
on
the
bottom
which
made
the
ford
in
some
places
a
little
difficult
even
at
its
low
stages
this
river
can
not
be
crossed
at
random
and
this
has
always
been
used
as
the
best
ford
the
low
stage
of
the
water
the
present
year
had
made
it
fordable
in
almost
any
part
of
its
course
where
access
could
be
had
to
its
bed
for
the
satisfaction
of
travelers
i
will
endeavor
to
give
some
description
of
the
nature
of
the
road
from
laramie
to
this
point
the
nature
of
the
soil
may
be
inferred
from
its
geological
formation
the
limestone
at
the
eastern
limit
of
this
section
is
succeeded
by
limestone
without
fossils
a
great
variety
of
sandstone
consisting
principally
of
red
sandstone
and
fine
conglomerates
the
red
sandstone
is
argillaceous
with
compact
white
gypsum
or
alabaster
very
beautiful
the
other
sandstones
are
gray
yellow
and
ferruginous
sometimes
very
coarse
the
apparent
sterility
of
the
country
must
therefore
be
sought
for
in
other
causes
than
the
nature
of
the
soil
the
face
of
the
country
can
not
with
propriety
be
called
hilly
it
is
a
succession
of
long
ridges
made
by
the
numerous
streams
which
come
down
from
the
neighboring
mountain
range
the
ridges
have
an
undulating
surface
with
some
such
appearance
as
the
ocean
presents
in
an
ordinary
breeze
the
road
which
is
now
generally
followed
through
this
region
is
therefore
a
very
good
one
without
any
difficult
ascents
to
overcome
the
principal
obstructions
are
near
the
river
where
the
transient
waters
of
heavy
rains
have
made
deep
ravines
with
steep
banks
which
renders
frequent
circuits
necessary
it
will
be
remembered
that
wagons
pass
this
road
only
once
or
twice
a
year
which
is
by
no
means
sufficient
to
break
down
the
stubborn
roots
of
the
innumerable
artemisia
bushes
a
partial
absence
of
these
is
often
the
only
indication
of
the
track
and
the
roughness
produced
by
their
roots
in
many
places
gives
the
road
the
character
of
one
newly
opened
in
a
wooded
country
this
is
usually
considered
the
worst
part
of
the
road
east
of
the
mountains
and
as
it
passes
through
an
open
prairie
region
may
be
much
improved
so
as
to
avoid
the
greater
part
of
the
inequalities
it
now
presents
from
the
mouth
of
the
kansas
to
the
green
river
valley
west
of
the
mountains
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
mountain
road
on
the
line
of
communication
we
continued
our
way
and
four
miles
beyond
the
ford
indians
were
discovered
again
and
i
halted
while
a
party
were
sent
forward
to
ascertain
who
they
were
in
a
short
time
they
returned
accompanied
by
a
number
of
indians
of
the
oglallah
band
of
sioux
from
them
we
received
some
interesting
information
they
had
formed
part
of
the
great
village
which
they
informed
us
had
broken
up
and
was
on
its
way
home
the
greater
part
of
the
village
including
the
arapahoes
cheyennes
and
oglallahs
had
crossed
the
platte
eight
or
ten
miles
below
the
mouth
of
the
sweet
water
and
were
now
behind
the
mountains
to
the
south
of
us
intending
to
regain
the
platte
by
way
of
deer
creek
they
had
taken
this
unusual
route
in
search
of
grass
and
game
they
gave
us
a
very
discouraging
picture
of
the
country
the
great
drought
and
the
plague
of
grasshoppers
had
swept
it
so
that
scarce
a
blade
of
grass
was
to
be
seen
and
there
was
not
a
buffalo
to
be
found
in
the
whole
region
their
people
they
further
said
had
been
nearly
starved
to
death
and
we
would
find
their
road
marked
by
lodges
which
they
had
thrown
away
in
order
to
move
more
rapidly
and
by
the
carcasses
of
the
horses
which
they
had
eaten
or
which
had
perished
by
starvation
such
was
the
prospect
before
us
when
he
had
finished
the
interpretation
of
these
things
bissonette
immediately
rode
up
to
me
and
urgently
advised
that
i
should
entirely
abandon
the
further
prosecution
of
my
exploration
meilleure
avis
que
je
pourrais
vous
donner
de
virer
de
the
best
advice
i
can
give
you
is
to
turn
back
at
once
it
was
his
own
intention
to
return
as
we
had
now
reached
the
point
to
which
he
had
engaged
to
attend
me
in
reply
i
called
up
my
men
and
communicated
to
them
fully
the
information
i
had
just
received
i
then
expressed
to
them
my
fixed
determination
to
proceed
to
the
end
of
the
enterprise
on
which
i
had
been
sent
but
as
the
situation
of
the
country
gave
me
some
reason
to
apprehend
that
it
might
be
attended
with
an
unfortunate
result
to
some
of
us
i
would
leave
it
optional
with
them
to
continue
with
me
or
to
return
among
them
were
some
five
or
six
who
i
knew
would
remain
we
had
still
ten
days
provisions
and
should
no
game
be
found
when
this
stock
was
expended
we
had
our
horses
and
mules
which
we
could
eat
when
other
means
of
subsistence
failed
but
not
a
man
flinched
from
the
undertaking
we
eat
the
mules
said
basil
lajeunesse
and
thereupon
we
shook
hands
with
our
interpreter
and
his
indians
and
parted
with
them
i
sent
back
one
of
my
men
dumes
whom
the
effects
of
an
old
wound
in
the
leg
rendered
incapable
of
continuing
the
journey
on
foot
and
his
horse
seemed
on
the
point
of
giving
out
having
resolved
to
disencumber
ourselves
immediately
of
every
thing
not
absolutely
necessary
to
our
future
operations
i
turned
directly
in
towards
the
river
and
encamped
on
the
left
bank
a
little
above
the
place
where
our
council
had
been
held
and
where
a
thick
grove
of
willows
offered
a
suitable
spot
for
the
object
i
had
in
view
the
carts
having
been
discharged
the
covers
and
wheels
were
taken
off
and
with
the
frames
carried
into
some
low
places
among
the
willows
and
concealed
in
the
dense
foliage
in
such
a
manner
that
the
glitter
of
the
might
not
attract
the
observation
of
some
straggling
indian
in
the
sand
which
had
been
blown
up
into
waves
among
the
willows
a
large
hole
was
then
dug
ten
feet
square
and
six
feet
deep
in
the
mean
time
all
our
effects
had
been
spread
out
upon
the
ground
and
whatever
was
designed
to
be
carried
along
with
us
separated
and
laid
aside
and
the
remaining
part
carried
to
the
hole
and
carefully
covered
up
as
much
as
possible
all
traces
of
our
proceedings
were
obliterated
and
it
wanted
but
a
rain
to
render
our
safe
beyond
discovery
all
the
men
were
now
set
at
work
to
arrange
the
and
make
up
the
packs
the
day
was
very
warm
and
calm
and
the
sky
entirely
clear
except
where
as
usual
along
the
summits
of
the
mountainous
ridge
opposite
the
clouds
had
congregated
in
masses
our
lodge
had
been
planted
and
on
account
of
the
heat
the
had
been
taken
out
and
the
lower
part
slightly
raised
near
to
it
was
standing
the
barometer
which
swung
in
a
tripod
frame
and
within
the
lodge
where
a
small
fire
had
been
built
preuss
was
occupied
in
observing
temperature
of
boiling
water
at
this
instant
and
without
any
warning
until
it
was
within
fifty
yards
a
violent
gust
of
wind
dashed
down
the
lodge
burying
under
it
preuss
and
about
a
dozen
men
who
had
attempted
to
keep
it
from
being
carried
away
i
succeeded
in
saving
the
barometer
which
the
lodge
was
carrying
off
with
itself
but
the
thermometer
was
broken
we
had
no
others
of
a
high
graduation
none
of
those
which
remained
going
higher
than
fahrenheit
our
astronomical
observations
gave
to
this
place
which
we
named
camp
a
longitude
of
latitude
all
our
arrangements
having
been
completed
we
left
the
encampment
at
this
morning
in
this
vicinity
the
ordinary
road
leaves
the
platte
and
crosses
over
to
the
sweet
water
river
which
it
strikes
near
rock
independence
instead
of
following
this
road
i
had
determined
to
keep
the
immediate
valley
of
the
platte
so
far
as
the
mouth
of
the
sweet
water
in
the
expectation
of
finding
better
grass
to
this
i
was
further
prompted
by
the
nature
of
my
instructions
to
carson
was
assigned
the
office
of
guide
as
we
had
now
reached
a
part
of
the
country
with
which
or
a
great
part
of
which
long
residence
had
made
him
familiar
in
a
few
miles
we
reached
the
red
buttes
a
famous
landmark
in
this
country
whose
geological
composition
is
red
sandstone
limestone
and
calcareous
sandstone
and
the
river
here
cuts
its
way
through
a
ridge
on
the
eastern
side
of
it
are
the
lofty
escarpments
of
red
argillaceous
sandstone
which
are
called
the
red
buttes
in
this
passage
the
stream
is
not
much
compressed
or
pent
up
there
being
a
bank
of
considerable
though
variable
breadth
on
either
side
immediately
on
entering
we
discovered
a
band
of
buffalo
the
hunters
failed
to
kill
any
of
them
the
leading
hunter
being
thrown
into
a
ravine
which
occasioned
some
delay
and
in
the
mean
time
the
herd
clambered
up
the
steep
face
of
the
ridge
it
is
sometimes
wonderful
to
see
these
apparently
clumsy
animals
make
their
way
up
and
down
the
most
broken
precipices
we
halted
to
noon
before
we
had
cleared
this
passage
at
a
spot
twelve
miles
distant
from
camp
where
we
found
an
abundance
of
grass
so
far
the
account
of
the
indians
was
found
to
be
false
on
the
banks
were
willow
and
cherry
trees
the
cherries
were
not
yet
ripe
but
in
the
thickets
were
numerous
fresh
tracks
of
the
grizzly
bear
which
are
very
fond
of
this
fruit
the
soil
here
is
red
the
composition
being
derived
from
the
red
sandstone
about
seven
miles
brought
us
through
the
ridge
in
which
the
course
of
the
river
is
north
and
south
here
the
valley
opens
out
broadly
and
high
walls
of
the
red
formation
present
themselves
among
the
hills
to
the
east
we
crossed
here
a
pretty
little
creek
an
affluent
of
the
right
bank
it
is
well
timbered
with
cottonwood
in
this
vicinity
and
the
absinthe
has
lost
its
character
and
becomes
small
trees
six
and
eight
feet
in
height
and
sometimes
eight
inches
in
diameter
two
or
three
miles
above
this
creek
we
made
our
encampment
having
traveled
miles
our
animals
fared
well
here
as
there
is
an
abundance
of
grass
the
river
bed
is
made
up
of
pebbles
and
in
the
bank
at
the
level
of
the
water
is
a
conglomerate
of
coarse
pebbles
about
the
size
of
ostrich
eggs
and
which
i
remarked
in
the
banks
of
the
laramie
fork
it
is
overlaid
by
a
soil
of
mixed
clay
and
sand
six
feet
thick
by
astronomical
observations
our
position
is
in
longitude
and
latitude
after
traveling
about
twelve
miles
this
morning
we
reached
a
place
where
the
indian
village
had
crossed
the
river
here
were
the
poles
of
discarded
lodges
and
skeletons
of
horses
lying
about
carson
who
had
never
been
higher
up
than
this
point
on
the
river
which
has
the
character
of
being
exceedingly
rugged
and
walled
in
by
precipices
above
thought
it
advisable
to
encamp
near
this
place
where
we
were
certain
of
obtaining
grass
and
make
our
crossing
among
the
rugged
hills
to
the
sweet
water
river
accordingly
we
turned
back
and
descended
the
river
to
an
island
near
by
which
was
about
twenty
acres
in
size
covered
with
a
luxuriant
growth
of
grass
the
formation
here
i
found
highly
interesting
immediately
at
this
island
the
river
is
again
shut
up
in
the
rugged
hills
which
come
down
to
it
from
the
main
ridge
in
a
succession
of
spurs
three
or
four
hundred
feet
high
and
alternated
with
green
level
or
meadows
bordered
on
the
river
banks
with
thickets
of
willow
and
having
many
plants
to
interest
the
traveler
the
island
lies
between
two
of
these
ridges
three
or
four
hundred
yards
apart
of
which
that
on
the
right
bank
is
composed
entirely
of
red
argillaceous
sandstone
with
thin
layers
of
fibrous
gypsum
on
the
left
bank
the
ridge
is
composed
entirely
of
silicious
the
pebbles
in
the
numerous
strata
increasing
in
size
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
where
they
are
as
large
as
a
man
head
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
determine
these
strata
incline
to
the
northeast
with
a
dip
of
about
this
or
conglomerate
formation
i
was
enabled
to
trace
through
an
extended
range
of
country
from
a
few
miles
east
of
the
meridian
of
fort
laramie
to
where
i
found
it
superposed
on
the
granite
of
the
rocky
mountains
in
longitude
from
its
appearance
the
main
chain
of
the
laramie
mountain
is
composed
of
this
rock
and
in
a
number
of
places
i
found
isolated
hills
which
served
to
mark
a
former
level
which
had
been
probably
swept
away
these
conglomerates
are
very
friable
and
easily
decomposed
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
this
formation
is
the
source
from
which
was
derived
the
great
deposite
of
sand
and
gravel
which
forms
the
surface
rock
of
the
prairie
country
west
of
the
mississippi
crossing
the
ridge
of
red
sandstone
and
traversing
the
little
prairie
which
lies
to
the
southward
of
it
we
made
in
the
afternoon
an
excursion
to
a
place
which
we
called
the
hot
spring
gate
this
place
has
much
the
appearance
of
a
gate
by
which
the
platte
passes
through
a
ridge
composed
of
a
white
and
calcareous
sandstone
the
length
of
the
passage
is
about
four
hundred
yards
with
a
smooth
green
prairie
on
either
side
through
this
place
the
stream
flows
with
a
quiet
current
unbroken
by
any
rapid
and
is
about
seventy
yards
wide
between
the
walls
which
rise
perpendicularly
from
the
water
to
that
on
the
right
bank
which
is
the
lower
the
barometer
gave
a
height
of
three
hundred
and
sixty
feet
this
place
will
be
more
particularly
described
hereafter
as
we
passed
through
it
on
our
return
we
saw
here
numerous
herds
of
mountain
sheep
and
frequently
heard
the
volley
of
rattling
stones
which
accompanied
their
rapid
descent
down
the
steep
hills
this
was
the
first
place
at
which
we
had
killed
any
of
these
animals
and
in
consequence
of
this
circumstance
and
of
the
abundance
of
these
sheep
or
goats
for
they
are
called
by
each
name
we
gave
our
encampment
the
name
of
goat
island
their
flesh
is
much
esteemed
by
the
hunters
and
has
very
much
the
flavor
of
alleghany
mountain
sheep
i
have
frequently
seen
the
horns
of
this
animal
three
feet
long
and
seventeen
inches
in
circumference
at
the
base
weighing
eleven
pounds
but
two
or
three
of
these
were
killed
by
our
party
at
this
place
and
of
these
the
horns
were
small
the
use
of
these
horns
seems
to
be
to
protect
the
animal
head
in
pitching
down
precipices
to
avoid
pursuing
wolves
their
only
safety
being
in
places
where
they
can
not
be
followed
the
bones
are
very
strong
and
solid
the
marrow
occupying
but
a
very
small
portion
of
the
bone
in
the
leg
about
the
thickness
of
a
rye
straw
the
hair
is
short
resembling
the
winter
color
of
our
common
deer
which
it
nearly
approaches
in
size
and
appearance
except
in
the
horns
it
has
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
goat
the
longitude
of
this
place
resulting
from
chronometer
and
lunar
distances
and
an
occultation
of
arietis
is
and
the
latitude
one
of
our
horses
which
had
given
out
we
left
to
receive
strength
on
the
island
intending
to
take
her
perhaps
on
our
return
this
morning
we
left
the
course
of
the
platte
to
cross
over
to
the
sweet
water
our
way
for
a
few
miles
lay
up
the
sandy
bed
of
a
dry
creek
in
which
i
found
several
interesting
plants
leaving
this
we
wended
our
way
to
the
summit
of
the
hills
of
which
the
peaks
are
here
eight
hundred
feet
above
the
platte
bare
and
rocky
a
long
and
gradual
slope
led
from
these
hills
to
the
sweet
water
which
we
reached
in
fifteen
miles
from
goat
island
i
made
an
early
encampment
here
in
order
to
give
the
hunters
an
opportunity
to
procure
a
supply
from
several
bands
of
buffalo
which
made
their
appearance
in
the
valley
near
by
the
stream
is
about
sixty
feet
wide
and
at
this
time
twelve
to
eighteen
inches
deep
with
a
very
moderate
current
the
adjoining
prairies
are
sandy
but
the
immediate
river
bottom
is
a
good
soil
which
afforded
an
abundance
of
soft
green
grass
to
our
horses
and
where
i
found
a
variety
of
interesting
plants
which
made
their
appearance
for
the
first
time
a
rain
made
it
unpleasantly
cold
and
there
was
no
tree
here
to
enable
us
to
pitch
our
single
tent
the
poles
of
which
had
been
left
at
our
we
had
therefore
no
shelter
except
what
was
to
be
found
under
cover
of
the
bushes
which
grew
in
many
thick
patches
one
or
two
and
sometimes
three
feet
high
august
the
hunters
went
ahead
this
morning
as
buffalo
appeared
tolerably
abundant
and
i
was
desirous
to
secure
a
small
stock
of
provisions
and
we
moved
about
seven
mules
up
the
valley
and
encamped
one
mile
below
rock
independence
this
is
an
isolated
granite
rock
about
six
hundred
and
fifty
yards
long
and
forty
in
height
except
in
a
depression
of
the
summit
where
a
little
soil
supports
a
scanty
growth
of
shrubs
with
a
solitary
dwarf
pine
it
is
entirely
bare
everywhere
within
six
or
eight
feet
of
the
ground
where
the
surface
is
sufficiently
smooth
and
in
some
places
sixty
or
eighty
feet
above
the
rock
is
inscribed
with
the
names
of
travelers
many
a
name
famous
in
the
history
of
this
country
and
some
well
known
to
science
are
to
be
found
mixed
among
those
of
the
traders
and
travelers
for
pleasure
and
curiosity
and
of
missionaries
among
the
savages
some
of
these
have
been
washed
away
by
the
rain
but
the
greater
number
are
still
very
legible
the
position
of
this
rock
is
in
longitude
latitude
we
remained
at
our
camp
of
august
until
noon
of
the
next
day
occupied
in
drying
meat
by
observation
the
longitude
of
the
place
is
latitude
five
miles
above
rock
independence
we
came
to
a
place
called
the
devil
gate
where
the
sweet
water
cuts
through
the
point
of
a
granite
ridge
the
length
of
the
passage
is
about
three
hundred
yards
and
the
width
yards
the
walls
of
rock
are
vertical
and
about
four
hundred
feet
in
height
and
the
stream
in
the
gate
is
almost
entirely
choked
up
by
masses
which
have
fallen
from
above
in
the
wall
on
the
right
bank
is
a
dike
of
cutting
through
a
gray
granite
near
the
point
of
this
ridge
crop
out
some
strata
of
the
valley
formation
consisting
of
a
grayish
micaceous
sandstone
and
conglomerate
and
marl
we
encamped
eight
miles
above
the
devil
gate
there
was
no
timber
of
any
kind
on
the
river
but
good
fires
were
made
of
drift
wood
aided
by
the
de
we
had
no
shelter
from
the
rain
which
commenced
with
squalls
of
wind
about
sunset
the
country
here
is
exceedingly
picturesque
on
either
side
of
the
valley
which
is
five
miles
broad
the
mountains
rise
to
the
height
of
twelve
and
fifteen
hundred
or
two
thousand
feet
on
the
south
side
the
range
appears
to
be
timbered
and
is
luminous
with
fires
probably
the
work
of
the
indians
who
have
just
passed
through
the
valley
on
the
north
broken
and
granite
masses
rise
abruptly
from
the
green
sward
of
the
river
terminating
in
a
line
of
broken
summits
except
in
the
crevices
of
the
rock
and
here
and
there
on
a
ledge
or
bench
of
the
mountain
where
a
few
hardy
pines
have
clustered
together
these
are
perfectly
bare
and
destitute
of
vegetation
among
these
masses
where
there
are
sometimes
isolated
hills
and
ridges
green
valleys
open
in
upon
the
river
which
sweeps
the
base
of
these
mountains
for
miles
everywhere
its
deep
verdure
and
profusion
of
beautiful
flowers
is
in
pleasing
contrast
with
the
sterile
grandeur
of
the
rock
and
the
barrenness
of
the
sandy
plain
which
from
the
right
bank
of
the
river
sweeps
up
to
the
mountain
range
that
forms
its
southern
boundary
the
great
evaporation
on
the
sandy
soil
of
this
elevated
plain
and
the
saline
efflorescences
which
whiten
the
ground
and
shine
like
lakes
reflecting
in
the
sun
make
a
soil
wholly
unfit
for
cultivation
we
were
early
on
the
road
the
next
morning
traveling
along
the
upper
part
of
the
valley
which
is
overgrown
with
scattered
about
on
the
plain
are
occasional
small
isolated
hills
one
of
these
which
i
have
examined
about
fifty
feet
high
consisted
of
white
clay
and
marl
in
nearly
horizontal
strata
several
bands
of
buffalo
made
their
appearance
with
herds
of
antelope
and
a
grizzly
bear
the
only
one
we
encountered
during
the
journey
was
seen
scrambling
up
among
the
rocks
as
we
passed
over
a
slight
rise
near
the
river
we
caught
the
first
view
of
the
wind
river
mountains
appearing
at
this
distance
of
about
seventy
miles
to
be
a
low
and
dark
mountainous
ridge
the
view
dissipated
in
a
moment
the
pictures
which
had
been
created
in
our
minds
by
many
descriptions
of
travelers
who
have
compared
these
mountains
to
the
alps
in
switzerland
and
speak
of
the
glittering
peaks
which
rise
in
icy
majesty
amidst
the
eternal
glaciers
nine
or
ten
thousand
feet
into
the
region
of
eternal
snows
the
nakedness
of
the
river
was
relieved
by
groves
of
willows
where
we
encamped
at
night
after
a
march
of
miles
and
numerous
flowers
had
made
the
river
bottom
look
gay
as
a
garden
we
found
here
a
horse
which
had
been
abandoned
by
the
indians
because
his
hoofs
had
been
so
much
worn
that
he
was
unable
to
travel
and
during
the
night
a
dog
came
into
the
camp
our
camp
was
at
the
foot
of
the
granite
mountains
which
we
climbed
this
morning
to
take
some
barometrical
heights
and
here
among
the
rocks
was
seen
the
first
magpie
on
our
return
we
saw
one
at
the
mouth
of
the
platte
river
we
left
here
one
of
our
horses
which
was
unable
to
proceed
farther
a
few
miles
from
the
encampment
we
left
the
river
which
makes
a
bend
to
the
south
and
traversing
an
undulating
country
consisting
of
a
grayish
micaceous
sandstone
and
conglomerates
struck
it
again
and
encamped
after
a
journey
of
miles
astronomical
observations
placed
us
in
latitude
and
longitude
the
morning
was
dark
with
a
driving
rain
and
disagreeably
cold
we
continued
our
route
as
usual
and
the
weather
became
so
bad
that
we
were
glad
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
shelter
offered
by
a
small
island
about
ten
miles
above
our
last
encampment
which
was
covered
with
a
dense
growth
of
willows
there
was
fine
grass
for
our
animals
and
the
timber
afforded
us
comfortable
protection
and
good
fires
in
the
afternoon
the
sun
broke
through
the
clouds
for
a
short
time
and
the
barometer
at
was
the
thermometer
with
the
wind
strong
from
the
northwest
we
availed
ourselves
of
the
fine
weather
to
make
excursions
in
the
neighborhood
the
river
at
this
place
is
bordered
by
hills
of
the
valley
formation
they
are
of
moderate
height
one
of
the
highest
peaks
on
the
right
bank
being
according
to
the
barometer
one
hundred
and
eighty
feet
above
the
river
on
the
left
bank
they
are
higher
they
consist
of
a
fine
white
clayey
sandstone
a
white
calcareous
sandstone
and
coarse
sandstone
or
it
continued
steadily
raining
all
day
but
notwithstanding
we
left
our
encampment
in
the
afternoon
our
animals
had
been
much
refreshed
by
their
repose
and
an
abundance
of
rich
soft
grass
which
had
been
much
improved
by
the
rains
in
about
three
miles
we
reached
the
entrance
of
a
where
the
sweet
water
issues
upon
the
more
open
valley
we
had
passed
over
immediately
at
the
entrance
and
superimposed
directly
upon
the
granite
are
strata
of
compact
calcareous
sandstone
and
chert
alternating
with
fine
white
and
and
fine
gray
and
red
sandstones
these
strata
dip
to
the
eastward
at
an
angle
of
about
and
form
the
western
limit
of
the
sandstone
and
limestone
formations
on
the
line
of
our
route
here
we
entered
among
the
primitive
rocks
the
usual
road
passes
to
the
right
of
this
place
but
we
wound
or
rather
scrambled
our
way
up
the
narrow
valley
for
several
hours
wildness
and
disorder
were
the
character
of
this
scenery
the
river
had
been
swollen
by
the
late
rains
and
came
rushing
through
with
an
impetuous
current
three
or
four
feet
deep
and
generally
twenty
yards
broad
the
valley
was
sometimes
the
breadth
of
the
stream
and
sometimes
opened
into
little
green
meadows
sixty
yards
wide
with
open
groves
of
aspen
the
stream
was
bordered
throughout
with
aspen
beech
and
willow
and
tall
pines
grow
on
the
sides
and
summits
of
the
crags
on
both
sides
the
granite
rocks
rose
precipitously
to
the
height
of
three
hundred
and
five
hundred
feet
terminating
in
jagged
and
broken
pointed
peaks
and
fragments
of
fallen
rock
lay
piled
up
at
the
foot
of
the
precipices
gneiss
mica
slate
and
a
white
granite
were
among
the
varieties
i
noticed
here
were
many
old
traces
of
beaver
on
the
stream
remnants
of
dams
near
which
were
lying
trees
which
they
had
cut
down
one
and
two
feet
in
diameter
the
hills
entirely
shut
up
the
river
at
the
end
of
about
five
miles
and
we
turned
up
a
ravine
that
led
to
a
high
prairie
which
seemed
to
be
the
general
level
of
the
country
hence
to
the
summit
of
the
ridge
there
is
a
regular
and
very
gradual
rise
blocks
of
granite
were
piled
up
at
the
heads
of
the
ravines
and
small
bare
knolls
of
mica
slate
and
milky
quartz
protruded
at
frequent
intervals
on
the
prairie
which
was
whitened
in
occasional
spots
with
small
salt
lakes
where
the
water
had
evaporated
and
left
the
bed
covered
with
a
shining
incrustation
of
salt
the
evening
was
very
cold
a
northwest
wind
driving
a
fine
rain
in
our
faces
and
at
nightfall
we
descended
to
a
little
stream
on
which
we
encamped
about
two
miles
from
the
sweet
water
here
had
recently
been
a
very
large
camp
of
the
snake
and
crow
indians
and
some
large
poles
lying
about
afforded
the
means
of
pitching
a
tent
and
making
other
places
of
shelter
our
fires
were
made
principally
of
the
dry
branches
of
the
artemisia
which
covered
the
slopes
it
burns
quickly
and
with
a
clear
oily
flame
and
makes
a
hot
fire
the
hills
here
are
composed
of
hard
compact
mica
slate
with
veins
of
quartz
we
left
our
encampment
with
the
rising
sun
as
we
rose
from
the
bed
of
the
creek
the
line
of
the
mountains
stretched
gradually
before
us
the
white
peaks
glittering
in
the
sun
they
had
been
hidden
in
the
dark
weather
of
the
last
few
days
and
it
had
been
on
them
while
it
in
the
plains
we
crossed
a
ridge
and
again
struck
the
sweet
water
here
a
beautiful
swift
stream
with
a
more
open
valley
timbered
with
beech
and
cottonwood
it
now
began
to
lose
itself
in
the
many
small
forks
which
make
its
head
and
we
continued
up
the
main
stream
until
near
noon
when
we
left
it
a
few
miles
to
make
our
noon
halt
on
a
small
creek
among
the
hills
from
which
the
stream
issues
by
a
small
opening
within
was
a
beautiful
grassy
spot
covered
with
an
open
grove
of
large
among
which
i
found
several
plants
that
i
had
not
previously
seen
the
afternoon
was
cloudy
with
squalls
of
rain
but
the
weather
became
fine
at
sunset
when
we
again
encamped
on
the
sweet
water
within
a
few
miles
of
the
south
pass
the
country
over
which
we
have
passed
consists
principally
of
the
compact
mica
slate
which
crops
out
on
all
ridges
making
the
uplands
very
rocky
and
slaty
in
the
escarpments
which
border
the
creeks
it
is
seen
alternating
with
a
granite
at
an
inclination
of
the
beds
varying
in
thickness
from
two
or
three
feet
to
six
or
eight
hundred
at
a
distance
the
granite
frequently
has
the
appearance
of
irregular
lumps
of
clay
hardened
by
exposure
a
variety
of
may
how
be
numbered
among
the
characteristic
plants
and
the
artemisia
continues
in
full
glory
but
have
become
rare
and
mosses
begin
to
dispute
the
hills
with
them
the
evening
was
damp
and
unpleasant
the
thermometer
at
ten
being
at
and
the
grass
wet
with
a
heavy
dew
our
astronomical
observations
placed
this
encampment
in
longitude
and
latitude
early
in
the
morning
we
resumed
our
journey
the
weather
still
cloudy
with
occasional
rain
our
general
course
was
west
as
i
had
determined
to
cross
the
dividing
ridge
by
a
among
the
country
more
immediately
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
and
return
by
the
wagon
road
two
and
a
half
miles
to
the
south
of
the
point
where
the
trail
crosses
about
six
miles
from
our
encampment
brought
us
to
the
summit
the
ascent
had
been
so
gradual
that
with
all
the
intimate
knowledge
possessed
by
carson
who
had
made
the
country
his
home
for
seventeen
years
we
were
obliged
to
watch
very
closely
to
find
the
place
at
which
we
had
reached
the
culminating
point
this
was
between
two
low
hills
rising
on
either
hand
fifty
or
sixty
feet
when
i
looked
back
at
them
from
the
foot
of
the
immediate
slope
on
the
western
plain
their
summits
appeared
to
be
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
above
from
the
impression
on
my
mind
at
this
time
and
subsequently
on
our
return
i
should
compare
the
elevation
which
we
surmounted
immediately
at
the
pass
to
the
ascent
of
the
capitol
hill
from
the
avenue
at
washington
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
fix
positively
the
breadth
of
this
pass
from
the
broken
ground
where
it
commences
at
the
foot
of
the
wind
river
chain
the
view
to
the
southeast
is
over
a
champaign
country
broken
at
the
distance
of
nineteen
miles
by
the
table
rock
which
with
the
other
isolated
hills
in
its
vicinity
seem
to
stand
on
a
comparative
plain
this
i
judged
to
be
its
termination
the
ridge
recovering
its
rugged
character
with
the
table
rock
it
will
be
seen
that
it
in
no
manner
resembles
the
places
to
which
the
term
is
commonly
applied
nothing
of
the
character
and
winding
ascents
of
the
alleghany
passes
in
america
nothing
of
the
great
bernard
and
simplon
passes
in
europe
approaching
it
from
the
mouth
of
the
sweet
water
a
sandy
plain
one
hundred
and
twenty
miles
long
conducts
by
a
gradual
and
regular
ascent
to
the
summit
about
seven
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
and
the
traveler
without
being
reminded
of
any
change
by
toilsome
ascents
suddenly
finds
himself
on
the
waters
which
flow
to
the
pacific
ocean
by
the
route
we
had
traveled
the
distance
from
fort
laramie
is
three
hundred
and
twenty
miles
or
nine
hundred
and
fifty
from
the
mouth
of
the
kansas
continuing
our
march
we
reached
in
eight
miles
from
the
pass
the
little
sandy
one
of
the
tributaries
of
the
colorado
or
green
river
of
the
gulf
of
california
the
weather
had
grown
fine
during
the
morning
and
we
remained
here
the
rest
of
the
day
to
dry
our
baggage
and
take
some
astronomical
observations
the
stream
was
about
forty
feet
wide
and
two
or
three
deep
with
clear
water
and
a
full
swift
current
over
a
sandy
bed
it
was
timbered
with
a
growth
of
low
bushy
and
dense
willows
among
which
were
little
verdant
spots
which
gave
our
animals
fine
grass
and
where
i
found
a
number
of
interesting
plants
among
the
neighboring
hills
i
noticed
fragments
of
granite
containing
magnetic
iron
longitude
of
the
camp
was
and
latitude
we
made
our
noon
halt
on
big
sandy
another
tributary
of
green
river
the
face
of
the
country
traversed
was
of
a
brown
sand
of
granite
materials
the
of
the
neighboring
mountain
strata
of
the
milky
quartz
cropped
out
and
blocks
of
granite
were
scattered
about
containing
magnetic
iron
on
sandy
creek
the
formation
was
of
sand
exhibited
in
escarpments
fifty
to
eighty
feet
high
in
the
afternoon
we
had
a
severe
storm
of
hail
and
encamped
at
sunset
on
the
first
new
fork
within
the
space
of
a
few
miles
the
wind
mountains
supply
a
number
of
tributaries
to
green
river
which
are
called
the
new
forks
near
our
camp
were
two
remarkable
isolated
hills
one
of
them
sufficiently
large
to
merit
the
name
of
mountain
they
are
called
the
two
buttes
and
will
serve
to
identify
the
place
of
our
encampment
which
the
observations
of
the
evening
placed
in
longitude
and
latitude
on
the
right
bank
of
the
stream
opposite
to
the
large
hill
the
strata
which
are
displayed
consist
of
decomposing
granite
which
supplies
the
brown
sand
of
which
the
face
of
the
country
is
composed
to
a
considerable
depth
the
air
at
sunrise
is
clear
and
pure
and
the
morning
extremely
cold
but
beautiful
a
lofty
snowy
peak
of
the
mountain
is
glittering
in
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
which
have
not
yet
reached
us
the
long
mountain
wall
to
the
east
rising
two
thousand
feet
abruptly
from
the
plain
behind
which
we
see
the
peaks
is
still
dark
and
cuts
clear
against
the
glowing
sky
a
fog
just
risen
from
the
river
lies
along
the
base
of
the
mountain
a
little
before
sunrise
the
thermometer
was
at
and
at
sunrise
water
froze
last
night
and
fires
are
very
comfortable
the
scenery
becomes
hourly
more
interesting
and
grand
and
the
view
here
is
truly
magnificent
but
indeed
it
needs
something
to
repay
the
long
prairie
journey
of
a
thousand
miles
the
sun
has
shot
above
the
wall
and
makes
a
magical
change
the
whole
valley
is
glowing
and
bright
and
all
the
mountain
peaks
are
gleaming
like
silver
though
these
snow
mountains
are
not
the
alps
they
have
their
own
character
of
grandeur
and
magnificence
and
doubtless
will
find
pens
and
pencils
to
do
them
justice
in
the
scene
before
us
we
feel
how
much
wood
improves
a
view
the
pines
on
the
mountain
seemed
to
give
it
much
additional
beauty
i
was
agreeably
disappointed
in
the
character
of
the
streams
on
this
side
of
the
ridge
instead
of
the
creeks
which
description
had
led
me
to
expect
i
find
bold
broad
streams
with
three
or
four
feet
water
and
a
rapid
current
the
fork
on
which
we
are
encamped
is
upwards
of
a
hundred
feet
wide
timbered
with
groves
or
thickets
of
the
low
willow
we
were
now
approaching
the
loftiest
part
of
the
wind
river
chain
and
i
left
the
valley
a
few
miles
from
our
encampment
intending
to
penetrate
the
mountains
as
far
as
possible
with
the
whole
party
we
were
soon
involved
in
very
broken
ground
among
long
ridges
covered
with
fragments
of
granite
winding
our
way
up
a
long
ravine
we
came
unexpectedly
in
view
of
a
most
beautiful
lake
set
like
a
gem
in
the
mountains
the
sheet
of
water
lay
transversely
across
the
direction
we
had
been
pursuing
and
descending
the
steep
rocky
ridge
where
it
was
necessary
to
lead
our
horses
we
followed
its
banks
to
the
southern
extremity
here
a
view
of
the
utmost
magnificence
and
grandeur
burst
upon
our
eyes
with
nothing
between
us
and
their
feet
to
lessen
the
effect
of
the
whole
height
a
grand
bed
of
mountains
rose
before
us
pile
upon
pile
glowing
in
the
bright
light
of
an
august
day
immediately
below
them
lay
the
lake
between
two
ridges
covered
with
dark
pines
which
swept
down
from
the
main
chain
to
the
spot
where
we
stood
here
where
the
lake
glittered
in
the
open
sunlight
its
banks
of
yellow
sand
and
the
light
foliage
of
aspen
groves
contrasted
well
with
the
gloomy
pines
never
before
said
preuss
in
this
country
or
in
europe
have
i
seen
such
grand
magnificent
rocks
i
was
so
much
pleased
with
the
beauty
of
the
place
that
i
determined
to
make
the
main
camp
here
where
our
animals
would
find
good
pasturage
and
explore
the
mountains
with
a
small
party
of
men
proceeding
a
little
further
we
came
suddenly
upon
the
outlet
of
the
lake
where
it
found
its
way
through
a
narrow
passage
between
low
hills
dark
pines
which
overhung
the
stream
and
masses
of
rock
where
the
water
foamed
along
gave
it
much
romantic
beauty
where
we
crossed
which
was
immediately
at
the
outlet
it
is
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
wide
and
so
deep
that
with
difficulty
we
were
able
to
ford
it
its
bed
was
an
accumulation
of
rocks
boulders
and
broad
slabs
and
large
angular
fragments
among
which
the
animals
fell
repeatedly
the
current
was
very
swift
and
the
water
cold
and
of
a
crystal
purity
in
crossing
this
stream
i
met
with
a
great
misfortune
in
having
my
barometer
broken
it
was
the
only
one
a
great
part
of
the
interest
of
the
journey
for
me
was
in
the
exploration
of
these
mountains
of
which
so
much
had
been
said
that
was
doubtful
and
contradictory
and
now
their
snowy
peaks
rose
majestically
before
me
and
the
only
means
of
giving
them
authentically
to
science
the
object
of
my
anxious
solicitude
by
night
and
day
was
destroyed
we
had
brought
this
barometer
in
safety
a
thousand
miles
and
broke
it
almost
among
the
snow
of
the
mountains
the
loss
was
felt
by
the
whole
camp
all
had
seen
my
anxiety
and
aided
me
in
preserving
it
the
height
of
these
mountains
considered
by
many
hunters
and
traders
the
highest
in
the
whole
range
had
been
a
theme
of
constant
discussion
among
them
and
all
had
looked
forward
with
pleasure
to
the
moment
when
the
instrument
which
they
believed
to
be
as
true
as
the
sun
should
stand
upon
the
summits
and
decide
their
disputes
their
grief
was
only
inferior
to
my
own
the
lake
is
about
three
miles
long
and
of
very
irregular
width
and
apparently
great
depth
and
is
the
of
the
third
new
fork
a
tributary
to
green
river
the
colorado
of
the
west
in
the
narrative
i
have
called
it
mountain
lake
i
encamped
on
the
north
side
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
yards
from
the
outlet
this
was
the
most
western
point
at
which
i
obtained
astronomical
observations
by
which
this
place
called
bernier
encampment
is
made
in
west
longitude
from
greenwich
and
latitude
the
mountain
peaks
as
laid
down
were
fixed
by
bearings
from
this
and
other
astronomical
points
we
had
no
other
compass
than
the
small
ones
used
in
sketching
the
country
but
from
an
azimuth
in
which
one
of
them
was
used
the
variation
of
the
compass
is
east
the
correction
made
in
our
by
the
astronomical
observations
indicates
that
this
is
a
very
correct
observation
as
soon
as
the
camp
was
formed
i
set
about
endeavoring
to
repair
my
barometer
as
i
have
already
said
this
was
a
standard
cistern
barometer
of
troughton
construction
the
glass
cistern
had
been
broken
about
midway
but
as
the
instrument
had
been
kept
in
a
proper
position
no
air
had
found
its
way
into
the
tube
the
end
of
which
had
always
remained
covered
i
had
with
me
a
number
of
vials
of
tolerably
thick
glass
some
of
which
were
of
the
same
diameter
as
the
cistern
end
i
spent
the
day
in
slowly
working
on
these
endeavoring
to
cut
them
of
the
requisite
length
but
as
my
instrument
was
a
very
rough
file
i
invariably
broke
them
a
groove
was
cut
in
one
of
the
trees
where
the
barometer
was
placed
during
the
night
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
any
possible
danger
and
in
the
morning
i
commenced
again
among
the
in
the
camp
i
found
one
which
was
very
transparent
so
that
its
contents
could
be
almost
as
plainly
seen
as
through
glass
this
i
boiled
and
stretched
on
a
piece
of
wood
to
the
requisite
diameter
and
scraped
it
very
thin
in
order
to
increase
to
the
utmost
its
transparency
i
then
secured
it
firmly
in
its
place
on
the
instrument
with
strong
glue
made
from
a
buffalo
and
filled
it
with
mercury
properly
heated
a
piece
of
skin
which
had
covered
one
of
the
vials
furnished
a
good
pocket
which
was
well
secured
with
strong
thread
and
glue
and
then
the
brass
cover
was
screwed
to
its
place
the
instrument
was
left
some
time
to
dry
and
when
i
reversed
it
a
few
hours
after
i
had
the
satisfaction
to
find
it
in
perfect
order
its
indications
being
about
the
same
as
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
before
it
had
been
broken
our
success
in
this
little
incident
diffused
pleasure
throughout
the
camp
and
we
immediately
set
about
our
preparations
for
ascending
the
mountains
as
will
be
seen
on
reference
to
a
map
on
this
short
mountain
chain
are
the
of
four
great
rivers
on
the
continent
namely
the
colorado
columbia
missouri
and
platte
rivers
it
had
been
my
design
after
ascending
the
mountains
to
continue
our
route
on
the
western
side
of
the
range
and
crossing
through
a
pass
at
the
northwestern
end
of
the
chain
about
thirty
miles
from
our
present
camp
return
along
the
eastern
slope
across
the
heads
of
the
yellowstone
river
and
join
on
the
line
to
our
station
of
august
immediately
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
in
this
way
i
should
be
enabled
to
include
the
whole
chain
and
its
numerous
waters
in
my
survey
but
various
considerations
induced
me
very
reluctantly
to
abandon
this
plan
i
was
desirous
to
keep
strictly
within
the
scope
of
my
instructions
and
it
would
have
required
ten
or
fifteen
additional
days
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
our
animals
had
become
very
much
worn
out
with
the
length
of
the
journey
game
was
very
scarce
and
though
it
does
not
appear
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
as
i
have
avoided
dwelling
upon
trifling
incidents
not
connected
with
the
objects
of
the
expedition
the
spirits
of
the
men
had
been
much
exhausted
by
the
hardships
and
privations
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
our
provisions
had
wellnigh
all
disappeared
bread
had
been
long
out
of
the
question
and
of
all
our
stock
we
had
remaining
two
or
three
pounds
of
coffee
and
a
small
quantity
of
macaroni
which
had
been
husbanded
with
great
care
for
the
mountain
expedition
we
were
about
to
undertake
our
daily
meal
consisted
of
dry
buffalo
meat
cooked
in
tallow
and
as
we
had
not
dried
this
with
indian
skill
part
of
it
was
spoiled
and
what
remained
of
good
was
as
hard
as
wood
having
much
the
taste
and
appearance
of
so
many
pieces
of
bark
even
of
this
our
stock
was
rapidly
diminishing
in
a
camp
which
was
capable
of
consuming
two
buffaloes
in
every
hours
these
animals
had
entirely
disappeared
and
it
was
not
probable
that
we
should
fall
in
with
them
again
until
we
returned
to
the
sweet
water
our
arrangements
for
the
ascent
were
rapidly
completed
we
were
in
a
hostile
country
which
rendered
the
greatest
vigilance
and
circumspection
necessary
the
pass
at
the
north
end
of
the
mountain
was
greatly
infested
by
blackfeet
and
immediately
opposite
was
one
of
their
forts
on
the
edge
of
a
little
thicket
two
or
three
hundred
feet
from
our
encampment
we
were
posted
in
a
grove
of
beech
on
the
margin
of
the
lake
and
a
few
hundred
feet
long
with
a
narrow
on
the
inner
side
bordered
by
the
rocky
ridge
in
the
upper
end
of
this
grove
we
cleared
a
circular
space
about
forty
feet
in
diameter
and
with
the
felled
timber
and
interwoven
branches
surrounded
it
with
a
breastwork
five
feet
in
height
a
gap
was
left
for
a
gate
on
the
inner
side
by
which
the
animals
were
to
be
driven
in
and
secured
while
the
men
slept
around
the
little
work
it
was
half
hidden
by
the
foliage
and
garrisoned
by
twelve
resolute
men
would
have
set
at
defiance
any
band
of
savages
which
might
chance
to
discover
them
in
the
interval
of
our
absence
fifteen
of
the
best
mules
with
fourteen
men
were
selected
for
the
mountain
party
our
provisions
consisted
of
dried
meat
for
two
days
with
our
little
stock
of
coffee
and
some
macaroni
in
addition
to
the
barometer
and
thermometer
i
took
with
me
a
sextant
and
spyglass
and
we
had
of
course
our
compasses
in
charge
of
the
camp
i
left
bernier
one
of
my
most
trustworthy
men
who
possessed
the
most
determined
courage
early
in
the
morning
we
left
the
camp
fifteen
in
number
well
armed
of
course
and
mounted
on
our
best
mules
a
carried
our
provisions
with
a
coffeepot
and
kettle
and
three
or
four
tin
cups
every
man
had
a
blanket
strapped
over
his
saddle
to
serve
for
his
bed
and
the
instruments
were
carried
by
turns
on
their
backs
we
entered
directly
on
rough
and
rocky
ground
and
just
after
crossing
the
ridge
had
the
good
fortune
to
shoot
an
antelope
we
heard
the
roar
and
had
a
glimpse
of
a
waterfall
as
we
rode
along
and
crossing
in
our
way
two
fine
streams
tributary
to
the
colorado
in
about
two
hours
ride
we
reached
the
top
of
the
first
row
or
range
of
the
mountains
here
again
a
view
of
the
most
romantic
beauty
met
our
eyes
it
seemed
as
if
from
the
vast
expanse
of
uninteresting
prairie
we
had
passed
over
nature
had
collected
all
her
beauties
together
in
one
chosen
place
we
were
overlooking
a
deep
valley
which
was
entirely
occupied
by
three
lakes
and
from
the
brink
to
the
surrounding
ridges
rose
precipitously
five
hundred
and
a
thousand
feet
covered
with
the
dark
green
of
the
balsam
pine
relieved
on
the
border
of
the
lake
with
the
light
foliage
of
the
aspen
they
all
communicated
with
each
other
and
the
green
of
the
waters
common
to
mountain
lakes
of
great
depth
showed
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
cross
them
the
surprise
manifested
by
our
guides
when
these
impassable
obstacles
suddenly
barred
our
progress
proved
that
they
were
among
the
hidden
treasures
of
the
place
unknown
even
to
the
wandering
trappers
of
the
region
descending
the
hill
we
proceeded
to
make
our
way
along
the
margin
to
the
southern
extremity
a
narrow
strip
of
angular
fragments
of
rock
sometimes
afforded
a
rough
pathway
for
our
mules
but
generally
we
rode
along
the
shelving
side
occasionally
scrambling
up
at
a
considerable
risk
of
tumbling
back
into
the
lake
the
slope
was
frequently
the
pines
grew
densely
together
and
the
ground
was
covered
with
the
branches
and
trunks
of
trees
the
air
was
fragrant
with
the
odor
of
the
pines
and
i
realized
this
delightful
morning
the
pleasure
of
breathing
that
mountain
air
which
makes
a
constant
theme
of
the
hunter
praise
and
which
now
made
us
feel
as
if
we
had
all
been
drinking
some
exhilarating
gas
the
depths
of
this
unexplored
forest
were
a
place
to
delight
the
heart
of
a
botanist
there
was
a
rich
undergrowth
of
plants
and
numerous
flowers
in
brilliant
bloom
we
reached
the
outlet
at
length
where
some
willows
that
lay
in
the
water
showed
that
beaver
had
been
recently
at
work
there
were
some
small
brown
squirrels
jumping
about
in
the
pines
and
a
couple
of
large
mallard
ducks
swimming
about
in
the
stream
the
hills
on
this
southern
end
were
low
and
the
lake
looked
like
a
mimic
sea
as
the
waves
broke
on
the
sandy
beach
in
the
force
of
a
strong
breeze
there
was
a
pretty
open
spot
with
fine
grass
for
our
mules
and
we
made
our
noon
halt
on
the
beach
under
the
shade
of
some
large
hemlocks
we
resumed
our
journey
after
a
halt
of
about
an
hour
making
our
way
up
the
ridge
on
the
western
side
of
the
lake
in
search
of
smoother
ground
we
rode
a
little
inland
and
passing
through
groves
of
aspen
soon
found
ourselves
again
among
the
pines
emerging
from
these
we
struck
the
summit
of
the
ridge
above
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
we
had
reached
a
very
elevated
point
and
in
the
valley
below
and
among
the
hills
were
a
number
of
lakes
of
different
levels
some
two
or
three
hundred
feet
above
others
with
which
they
communicated
by
foaming
torrents
even
to
our
great
height
the
roar
of
the
cataracts
came
up
and
we
could
see
them
leaping
down
in
lines
of
snowy
foam
from
this
scene
of
busy
waters
we
turned
abruptly
into
the
stillness
of
a
forest
where
we
rode
among
the
open
bolls
of
the
pines
over
a
lawn
of
verdant
grass
having
strikingly
the
air
of
cultivated
grounds
this
led
us
after
a
time
among
masses
of
rock
which
had
no
vegetable
earth
but
in
hollows
and
crevices
though
still
the
pine
forest
continued
towards
evening
we
reached
a
defile
or
rather
a
hole
in
the
mountains
entirely
shut
in
by
dark
rocks
a
small
stream
with
scarcely
perceptible
current
flowed
through
a
level
bottom
of
perhaps
eighty
yards
width
where
the
grass
was
saturated
with
water
into
this
the
mules
were
turned
and
were
neither
hobbled
nor
picketed
during
the
night
as
the
fine
pasturage
took
away
all
temptation
to
stray
and
we
made
our
bivouac
in
the
pines
the
surrounding
masses
were
all
of
granite
while
supper
was
being
prepared
i
set
out
on
an
excursion
in
the
neighborhood
accompanied
by
one
of
my
men
we
wandered
about
among
the
crags
and
ravines
until
dark
richly
repaid
for
our
walk
by
a
fine
collection
of
plants
many
of
them
in
full
bloom
ascending
a
peak
to
find
the
place
of
our
camp
we
saw
that
the
little
defile
in
which
we
lay
communicated
with
the
long
green
valley
of
some
stream
which
here
locked
up
in
the
mountains
far
away
to
the
south
found
its
way
in
a
dense
forest
to
the
plains
looking
along
its
upward
course
it
seemed
to
conduct
by
a
smooth
gradual
slope
directly
towards
the
peak
which
from
long
consultation
as
we
approached
the
mountain
we
had
decided
to
be
the
highest
of
the
range
pleased
with
the
discovery
of
so
fine
a
road
for
the
next
day
we
hastened
down
to
the
camp
where
we
arrived
just
in
time
for
supper
our
was
rather
scant
and
we
held
the
meat
in
our
hands
and
clean
rocks
made
good
plates
on
which
we
spread
our
macaroni
among
all
the
strange
places
on
which
we
had
occasion
to
encamp
during
our
long
journey
none
have
left
so
vivid
an
impression
on
my
mind
as
the
camp
of
this
evening
the
disorder
of
the
masses
which
surrounded
us
the
little
hole
through
which
we
saw
the
stars
over
head
the
dark
pines
where
we
slept
and
the
rocks
lit
up
with
the
glow
of
our
fires
made
a
of
very
wild
beauty
the
morning
was
bright
and
pleasant
just
cool
enough
to
make
exercise
agreeable
and
we
soon
entered
the
defile
i
had
seen
the
preceding
day
it
was
smoothly
carpeted
with
soft
grass
and
scattered
over
with
groups
of
flowers
of
which
yellow
was
the
predominant
color
sometimes
we
were
forced
by
an
occasional
difficult
pass
to
pick
our
way
on
a
narrow
ledge
along
the
side
of
the
defile
and
the
mules
were
frequently
on
their
knees
but
these
obstructions
were
rare
and
we
journeyed
on
in
the
sweet
morning
air
delighted
at
our
good
fortune
in
having
found
such
a
beautiful
entrance
to
the
mountains
this
road
continued
for
about
three
miles
when
we
suddenly
reached
its
termination
in
one
of
the
grand
views
which
at
every
turn
meet
the
traveler
in
this
magnificent
region
here
the
defile
up
which
we
had
traveled
opened
out
into
a
small
lawn
where
in
a
little
lake
the
stream
had
its
source
there
were
some
fine
in
bloom
but
all
the
flowering
plants
appeared
to
seek
the
shelter
of
the
rocks
and
to
be
of
lower
growth
than
below
as
if
they
loved
the
warmth
of
the
soil
and
kept
out
of
the
way
of
the
winds
immediately
at
our
feet
a
precipitous
descent
led
to
a
confusion
of
defiles
and
before
us
rose
the
mountains
as
we
have
represented
them
in
the
annexed
view
it
is
not
by
the
splendor
of
views
which
have
lent
such
a
glory
to
the
alps
that
these
impress
the
mind
but
by
a
gigantic
disorder
of
enormous
masses
and
a
savage
sublimity
of
naked
rock
in
wonderful
contrast
with
innumerable
green
spots
of
a
rich
floral
beauty
shut
up
in
their
stern
recesses
their
wildness
seems
well
suited
to
the
character
of
the
people
who
inhabit
the
country
i
determined
to
leave
our
animals
here
and
make
the
rest
of
our
way
on
foot
the
peak
appeared
so
near
that
there
was
no
doubt
of
our
returning
before
night
and
a
few
men
were
left
in
charge
of
the
mules
with
our
provisions
and
blankets
we
took
with
us
nothing
but
our
arms
and
instruments
and
as
the
day
had
become
warm
the
greater
part
left
our
coats
having
made
an
early
dinner
we
started
again
we
were
soon
involved
in
the
most
ragged
precipices
nearing
the
central
chain
very
slowly
and
rising
but
little
the
first
ridge
hid
a
succession
of
others
and
when
with
great
fatigue
and
difficulty
we
had
climbed
up
five
hundred
feet
it
was
but
to
make
an
equal
descent
on
the
other
side
all
these
intervening
places
were
filled
with
small
deep
lakes
which
met
the
eye
in
every
direction
descending
from
one
level
to
another
sometimes
under
bridges
formed
by
huge
fragments
of
granite
beneath
which
was
heard
the
roar
of
the
water
these
constantly
obstructed
our
path
forcing
us
to
make
long
frequently
obliged
to
retrace
our
steps
and
frequently
falling
among
the
rocks
maxwell
was
precipitated
towards
the
face
of
a
precipice
and
saved
himself
from
going
over
by
throwing
himself
flat
on
the
ground
we
clambered
on
always
expecting
with
every
ridge
that
we
crossed
to
reach
the
foot
of
the
peaks
and
always
disappointed
until
about
four
when
pretty
well
worn
out
we
reached
the
shore
of
a
little
lake
in
which
was
a
rocky
island
we
remained
here
a
short
time
to
rest
and
continued
on
around
the
lake
which
had
in
some
places
a
beach
of
white
sand
and
in
others
was
bound
with
rocks
over
which
the
way
was
difficult
and
dangerous
as
the
water
from
innumerable
springs
made
them
very
slippery
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
further
side
of
the
lake
we
found
ourselves
all
exceedingly
fatigued
and
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
whole
party
we
encamped
the
spot
we
had
chosen
was
a
broad
flat
rock
in
some
measure
protected
from
the
winds
by
the
surrounding
crags
and
the
trunks
of
fallen
pines
afforded
us
bright
fires
near
by
was
a
foaming
torrent
which
tumbled
into
the
little
lake
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
below
us
and
which
by
way
of
distinction
we
have
called
island
lake
we
had
reached
the
upper
limit
of
the
piney
region
as
above
this
point
no
tree
was
to
be
seen
and
patches
of
snow
lay
everywhere
around
us
on
the
cold
sides
of
the
rocks
the
flora
of
the
region
we
had
traversed
since
leaving
our
mules
was
extremely
rich
and
among
the
characteristic
plants
the
scarlet
flowers
of
the
everywhere
met
the
eye
in
great
abundance
a
small
green
ravine
on
the
edge
of
which
we
were
encamped
was
filled
with
a
profusion
of
alpine
plants
in
brilliant
bloom
from
barometrical
observations
made
during
our
three
days
sojourn
at
this
place
its
elevation
above
the
gulf
of
mexico
is
feet
during
the
day
we
had
seen
no
sign
of
animal
life
but
among
the
rocks
here
we
heard
what
was
supposed
to
be
the
bleat
of
a
young
goat
which
we
searched
for
with
hungry
activity
and
found
to
proceed
from
a
small
animal
of
a
gray
color
with
short
ears
and
no
tail
probably
the
siberian
squirrel
we
saw
a
considerable
number
of
them
and
with
the
exception
of
a
small
bird
like
a
sparrow
it
is
the
only
inhabitant
of
this
elevated
part
of
the
mountains
on
our
return
we
saw
below
this
lake
large
flocks
of
the
we
had
nothing
to
eat
lajeunesse
with
several
others
took
their
guns
and
sallied
out
in
search
of
a
goat
but
returned
unsuccessful
at
sunset
the
barometer
stood
at
the
attached
thermometer
here
we
had
the
misfortune
to
break
our
thermometer
having
now
only
that
attached
to
the
barometer
i
was
taken
ill
shortly
after
we
had
encamped
and
continued
so
until
late
in
the
night
with
violent
headache
and
vomiting
this
was
probably
caused
by
the
excessive
fatigue
i
had
undergone
and
want
of
food
and
perhaps
also
in
some
measure
by
the
rarity
of
the
air
the
night
was
cold
as
a
violent
gale
from
the
north
had
sprung
up
at
sunset
which
entirely
blew
away
the
heat
of
the
fires
the
cold
and
our
granite
beds
had
not
been
favorable
to
sleep
and
we
were
glad
to
see
the
face
of
the
sun
in
the
morning
not
being
delayed
by
any
preparation
for
breakfast
we
set
out
immediately
on
every
side
as
we
advanced
was
heard
the
roar
of
waters
and
of
a
torrent
which
we
followed
up
a
short
distance
until
it
expanded
into
a
lake
about
one
mile
in
length
on
the
northern
side
of
the
lake
was
a
bank
of
ice
or
rather
of
snow
covered
with
a
crust
of
ice
carson
had
been
our
guide
into
the
mountains
and
agreeably
to
his
advice
we
left
this
little
valley
and
took
to
the
ridges
again
which
we
found
extremely
broken
and
where
we
were
again
involved
among
precipices
here
were
among
which
we
were
all
dispersed
seeking
each
the
best
path
to
ascend
the
peak
preuss
attempted
to
walk
along
the
upper
edge
of
one
of
these
fields
which
sloped
away
at
an
angle
of
about
twenty
degrees
but
his
feet
slipped
from
under
him
and
he
went
plunging
down
the
plain
a
few
hundred
feet
below
at
the
bottom
were
some
fragments
of
sharp
rock
on
which
he
landed
and
though
he
turned
a
couple
of
somersets
fortunately
received
no
injury
beyond
a
few
bruises
two
of
the
men
clement
lambert
and
descoteaux
had
been
taken
ill
and
lay
down
on
the
rocks
a
short
distance
below
and
at
this
point
i
was
attacked
with
headache
and
giddiness
accompanied
by
vomiting
as
on
the
day
before
finding
myself
unable
to
proceed
i
sent
the
barometer
over
to
preuss
who
was
in
a
gap
two
or
three
hundred
yards
distant
desiring
him
to
reach
the
peak
if
possible
and
take
an
observation
there
he
found
himself
unable
to
proceed
further
in
that
direction
and
took
an
observation
where
the
barometer
stood
at
attached
thermometer
in
the
gap
carson
who
had
gone
over
to
him
succeeded
in
reaching
one
of
the
snowy
summits
of
the
main
ridge
whence
he
saw
the
peak
towards
which
all
our
efforts
had
been
directed
towering
eight
or
ten
hundred
feet
into
the
air
above
him
in
the
mean
time
finding
myself
grow
rather
worse
than
better
and
doubtful
how
far
my
strength
would
carry
me
i
sent
basil
lajeunesse
with
four
men
back
to
the
place
where
the
mules
had
been
left
we
were
now
better
acquainted
with
the
topography
of
the
country
and
i
directed
him
to
bring
back
with
him
if
it
were
in
any
way
possible
four
or
five
mules
with
provisions
and
blankets
with
me
were
maxwell
and
ayer
and
after
we
had
remained
nearly
an
hour
on
the
rock
it
became
so
unpleasantly
cold
though
the
day
was
bright
that
we
set
out
on
our
return
to
the
camp
at
which
we
all
arrived
safely
straggling
in
one
after
the
other
i
continued
ill
during
the
afternoon
but
became
better
towards
sundown
when
my
recovery
was
completed
by
the
appearance
of
basil
and
four
men
all
mounted
the
men
who
had
gone
with
him
had
been
too
much
fatigued
to
return
and
were
relieved
by
those
in
charge
of
the
horses
but
in
his
powers
of
endurance
basil
resembled
more
a
than
a
man
they
brought
blankets
and
provisions
and
we
enjoyed
well
our
dried
meat
and
a
cup
of
good
coffee
we
rolled
ourselves
up
in
our
blankets
and
with
our
feet
turned
to
a
blazing
fire
slept
soundly
until
morning
it
had
been
supposed
that
we
had
finished
with
the
mountains
and
the
evening
before
it
had
been
arranged
that
carson
should
set
out
at
daylight
and
return
to
breakfast
at
the
camp
of
the
mules
taking
with
him
all
but
four
or
five
men
who
were
to
stay
with
me
and
bring
back
the
mules
and
instruments
accordingly
at
the
break
of
day
they
set
out
with
preuss
and
myself
remained
basil
lajeunesse
clement
lambert
janisse
and
descoteaux
when
we
had
secured
strength
for
the
day
by
a
hearty
breakfast
we
covered
what
remained
which
was
enough
for
one
meal
with
rocks
in
order
that
it
might
be
safe
from
any
marauding
bird
and
saddling
our
mules
turned
our
faces
once
more
towards
the
peaks
this
time
we
determined
to
proceed
quietly
and
cautiously
deliberately
resolved
to
accomplish
our
object
if
it
were
within
the
compass
of
human
means
we
were
of
opinion
that
a
long
defile
which
lay
to
the
left
of
yesterday
route
would
lead
us
to
the
foot
of
the
main
peak
our
mules
had
been
refreshed
by
the
fine
grass
in
the
little
ravine
at
the
island
camp
and
we
intended
to
ride
up
the
defile
as
far
as
possible
in
order
to
husband
our
strength
for
the
main
ascent
though
this
was
a
fine
passage
still
it
was
a
defile
of
the
most
rugged
mountains
known
and
we
had
many
a
rough
and
steep
slippery
place
to
cross
before
reaching
the
end
in
this
place
the
sun
rarely
shone
snow
lay
along
the
border
of
the
small
stream
which
flowed
through
it
and
occasional
icy
passages
made
the
footing
of
the
mules
very
insecure
and
the
rocks
and
ground
were
moist
with
the
trickling
waters
in
this
spring
of
mighty
rivers
we
soon
had
the
satisfaction
to
find
ourselves
riding
along
the
huge
wall
which
forms
the
central
summits
of
the
chain
there
at
last
it
rose
by
our
sides
a
nearly
perpendicular
wall
of
granite
terminating
to
feet
above
our
heads
in
a
serrated
line
of
broken
jagged
cones
we
rode
on
until
we
came
almost
immediately
below
the
main
peak
which
i
denominated
the
snow
peak
as
it
exhibited
more
snow
to
the
eye
than
any
of
the
neighboring
summits
here
were
three
small
lakes
of
a
green
color
each
perhaps
of
a
thousand
yards
in
diameter
and
apparently
very
deep
these
lay
in
a
kind
of
chasm
and
according
to
the
barometer
we
had
attained
but
a
few
hundred
feet
above
the
island
lake
the
barometer
here
stood
at
attached
thermometer
we
managed
to
get
our
mules
up
to
a
little
bench
about
a
hundred
feet
above
the
lakes
where
there
was
a
patch
of
good
grass
and
turned
them
loose
to
graze
during
our
rough
ride
to
this
place
they
had
exhibited
a
wonderful
surefootedness
parts
of
the
defile
were
filled
with
angular
sharp
fragments
of
rock
three
or
four
and
eight
or
ten
feet
cube
and
among
these
they
had
worked
their
way
leaping
from
one
narrow
point
to
another
rarely
making
a
false
step
and
giving
us
no
occasion
to
dismount
having
divested
ourselves
of
every
unnecessary
encumbrance
we
commenced
the
ascent
this
time
like
experienced
travelers
we
did
not
press
ourselves
but
climbed
leisurely
sitting
down
so
soon
as
we
found
breath
beginning
to
fail
at
intervals
we
reached
places
where
a
number
of
springs
gushed
from
the
rocks
and
about
feet
above
the
lakes
came
to
the
snow
line
from
this
point
our
progress
was
uninterrupted
climbing
hitherto
i
had
worn
a
pair
of
thick
moccasins
with
soles
of
but
here
i
put
on
a
light
thin
pair
which
i
had
brought
for
the
purpose
as
now
the
use
of
our
toes
became
necessary
to
a
further
advance
i
availed
myself
of
a
sort
of
comb
of
the
mountain
which
stood
against
the
wall
like
a
buttress
and
which
the
wind
and
the
solar
radiation
joined
to
the
steepness
of
the
smooth
rock
had
kept
almost
entirely
free
from
snow
up
this
i
made
my
way
rapidly
our
cautious
method
of
advancing
at
the
outset
had
spared
my
strength
and
with
the
exception
of
a
slight
disposition
to
headache
i
felt
no
remains
of
yesterday
illness
in
a
few
minutes
we
reached
a
point
where
the
buttress
was
overhanging
and
there
was
no
other
way
of
surmounting
the
difficulty
than
by
passing
around
one
side
of
it
which
was
the
face
of
a
vertical
precipice
of
several
hundred
feet
putting
hands
and
feet
in
the
crevices
between
the
blocks
i
succeeded
in
getting
over
it
and
when
i
reached
the
top
found
my
companions
in
a
small
valley
below
descending
to
them
we
continued
climbing
and
in
a
short
time
reached
the
crest
i
sprang
upon
the
summit
and
another
step
would
have
precipitated
me
into
an
immense
five
hundred
feet
below
to
the
edge
of
this
field
was
a
sheer
icy
precipice
and
then
with
a
gradual
fall
the
field
sloped
off
for
about
a
mile
until
it
struck
the
foot
of
another
lower
ridge
i
stood
on
a
narrow
crest
about
three
feet
in
width
with
an
inclination
of
about
as
soon
as
i
had
gratified
the
first
feelings
of
curiosity
i
descended
and
each
man
ascended
in
his
turn
for
i
would
only
allow
one
at
a
time
to
mount
the
unstable
and
precarious
slab
which
it
seemed
a
breath
would
hurl
into
the
abyss
below
we
mounted
the
barometer
in
the
snow
of
the
summit
and
fixing
a
ramrod
in
a
crevice
unfurled
the
national
flag
to
wave
in
the
breeze
where
never
flag
waved
before
during
our
morning
ascent
we
had
met
no
sign
of
animal
life
except
the
small
bird
already
mentioned
a
stillness
the
most
profound
and
a
terrible
solitude
forced
themselves
constantly
on
the
mind
as
the
great
features
of
the
place
here
on
the
summit
where
the
stillness
was
absolute
unbroken
by
any
sound
and
solitude
complete
we
thought
ourselves
beyond
the
region
of
animated
life
but
while
we
were
sitting
on
the
rock
a
solitary
bee
the
came
winging
his
flight
from
the
eastern
valley
and
lit
on
the
knee
of
one
of
the
men
it
was
a
strange
place
the
icy
rock
and
the
highest
peak
of
the
rocky
mountains
for
a
lover
of
warm
sunshine
and
flowers
and
we
pleased
ourselves
with
the
idea
that
he
was
the
first
of
his
species
to
cross
the
mountain
barrier
a
solitary
pioneer
to
foretell
the
advance
of
civilization
i
believe
that
a
moment
thought
would
have
made
us
let
him
continue
his
way
unharmed
but
we
carried
out
the
law
of
this
country
where
all
animated
nature
seems
at
war
and
seizing
him
immediately
put
him
in
at
least
a
fit
place
in
the
leaves
of
a
large
book
among
the
flowers
we
had
collected
on
our
way
the
barometer
stood
at
the
attached
thermometer
at
giving
for
the
elevation
of
this
summit
feet
above
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
may
be
called
the
highest
flight
of
the
bee
it
is
certainly
the
highest
known
flight
of
that
insect
from
the
description
given
by
mackenzie
of
the
mountains
where
he
crossed
them
with
that
of
a
french
officer
still
farther
to
the
north
and
colonel
long
measurements
to
the
south
joined
to
the
opinion
of
the
oldest
traders
of
the
country
it
is
presumed
that
this
is
the
highest
peak
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
day
was
sunny
and
bright
but
a
slight
shining
mist
hung
over
the
lower
plains
which
interfered
with
our
view
of
the
surrounding
country
on
one
side
we
overlooked
innumerable
lakes
and
streams
the
spring
of
the
colorado
of
the
gulf
of
california
and
on
the
other
was
the
wind
river
valley
where
were
the
heads
of
the
yellowstone
branch
of
the
missouri
far
to
the
north
we
could
just
discover
the
snowy
heads
of
the
where
were
the
sources
of
the
missouri
and
columbia
rivers
and
at
the
southern
extremity
of
the
ridge
the
peaks
were
plainly
visible
among
which
were
some
of
the
springs
of
the
nebraska
or
platte
river
around
us
the
whole
scene
had
one
main
striking
feature
which
was
that
of
terrible
convulsion
parallel
to
its
length
the
ridge
was
split
into
chasms
and
fissures
between
which
rose
the
thin
lofty
walls
terminated
with
slender
minarets
and
columns
according
to
the
barometer
the
little
crest
of
the
wall
on
which
we
stood
was
three
thousand
five
hundred
and
seventy
feet
above
that
place
and
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighty
above
the
little
lakes
at
the
bottom
immediately
at
our
feet
our
camp
at
the
two
hills
an
astronomical
station
bore
south
east
which
with
a
bearing
afterwards
obtained
from
a
fixed
position
enabled
us
to
locate
the
peak
the
bearing
of
the
was
north
west
and
the
direction
of
the
central
ridge
of
the
wind
river
mountains
south
east
the
summit
rock
was
gneiss
succeeded
by
sienitic
gneiss
sienite
and
feldspar
succeeded
in
our
descent
to
the
snow
line
where
we
found
a
feldspathic
granite
i
had
remarked
that
the
noise
produced
by
the
explosion
of
our
pistols
had
the
usual
degree
of
loudness
but
was
not
in
the
least
prolonged
expiring
almost
instantaneously
having
now
made
what
observations
our
means
afforded
we
proceeded
to
descend
we
had
accomplished
an
object
of
laudable
ambition
and
beyond
the
strict
order
of
our
instructions
we
had
climbed
the
loftiest
peak
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
looked
down
upon
the
snow
a
thousand
feet
below
and
standing
where
never
human
foot
had
stood
before
felt
the
exultation
of
first
explorers
it
was
about
two
when
we
left
the
summit
and
when
we
reached
the
bottom
the
sun
had
already
sunk
behind
the
wall
and
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
it
would
have
been
pleasant
to
have
lingered
here
and
on
the
summit
longer
but
we
hurried
away
as
rapidly
as
the
ground
would
permit
for
it
was
an
object
to
regain
our
party
as
soon
as
possible
not
knowing
what
accident
the
next
hour
might
bring
forth
we
reached
our
deposite
of
provisions
at
nightfall
here
was
not
the
inn
which
awaits
the
tired
traveler
on
his
return
from
mont
blanc
or
the
orange
groves
of
south
america
with
their
refreshing
juices
and
soft
fragrant
air
but
we
found
our
little
of
dried
meat
and
coffee
undisturbed
though
the
moon
was
bright
the
road
was
full
of
precipices
and
the
fatigue
of
the
day
had
been
great
we
therefore
abandoned
the
idea
of
rejoining
our
friends
and
lay
down
on
the
rock
and
in
spite
of
the
cold
slept
soundly
we
left
our
encampment
with
the
daylight
we
saw
on
our
way
large
flocks
of
the
looking
down
on
us
from
the
cliffs
at
the
crack
of
the
rifle
they
would
bound
off
among
the
rocks
and
in
a
few
minutes
make
their
appearance
on
some
lofty
peak
some
hundred
or
a
thousand
feet
above
it
is
needless
to
attempt
any
further
description
of
the
country
the
portion
over
which
we
traveled
this
morning
was
rough
as
imagination
could
picture
it
and
to
us
seemed
equally
beautiful
a
concourse
of
lakes
and
rushing
waters
mountains
of
rocks
naked
and
destitute
of
vegetable
earth
dells
and
ravines
of
the
most
exquisite
beauty
all
kept
green
and
fresh
by
the
great
moisture
in
the
air
and
sown
with
brilliant
flowers
and
everywhere
thrown
around
all
the
glory
of
most
magnificent
scenes
these
constitute
the
features
of
the
place
and
impress
themselves
vividly
on
the
mind
of
the
traveler
it
was
not
until
that
we
reached
the
place
where
our
animals
had
been
left
when
we
first
attempted
the
mountains
on
foot
near
one
of
the
still
burning
fires
we
found
a
piece
of
meat
which
our
friends
had
thrown
away
and
which
furnished
us
a
mouthful
a
very
scanty
breakfast
we
continued
directly
on
and
reached
our
camp
on
the
mountain
lake
at
dusk
we
found
all
well
nothing
had
occurred
to
interrupt
the
quiet
since
our
departure
and
the
fine
grass
and
good
cool
water
had
done
much
to
our
animals
all
heard
with
great
delight
the
order
to
turn
our
faces
homeward
and
towards
sundown
of
the
we
encamped
again
at
the
two
buttes
in
the
course
of
this
afternoon
march
the
barometer
was
broken
past
remedy
i
regretted
it
as
i
was
desirous
to
compare
it
again
with
engleman
barometers
at
louis
to
which
mine
were
referred
but
it
had
done
its
part
well
and
my
objects
were
mainly
fulfilled
we
left
our
camp
on
little
sandy
river
about
seven
in
the
morning
and
traversed
the
same
sandy
undulating
country
the
air
was
filled
with
the
turpentine
scent
of
the
various
which
are
now
in
bloom
and
numerous
as
they
are
give
much
gayety
to
the
landscape
of
the
plains
at
ten
we
stood
exactly
on
the
divide
in
the
pass
where
the
crosses
and
descending
immediately
upon
the
sweet
water
halted
to
take
a
meridian
observation
of
the
sun
the
latitude
was
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
we
saw
buffalo
again
and
at
our
evening
halt
on
the
sweet
water
the
roasted
ribs
again
made
their
appearance
around
the
fires
and
with
them
good
humor
and
laughter
and
song
were
restored
to
the
camp
our
coffee
had
been
expended
but
we
now
made
a
kind
of
tea
from
the
roots
of
the
tree
yesterday
evening
we
reached
our
encampment
at
rock
independence
where
i
took
some
astronomical
observations
here
not
unmindful
of
the
custom
of
early
travelers
and
explorers
in
our
country
i
engraved
on
this
rock
of
the
far
west
a
symbol
of
the
christian
faith
among
the
thickly
inscribed
names
i
made
on
the
hard
granite
the
impression
of
a
large
cross
which
i
covered
with
a
black
preparation
of
well
calculated
to
resist
the
influence
of
wind
and
rain
it
stands
amidst
the
names
of
many
who
have
long
since
found
their
way
to
the
grave
and
for
whom
the
huge
rock
is
a
giant
gravestone
one
george
weymouth
was
sent
out
to
maine
by
the
earl
of
southampton
lord
arundel
and
others
and
in
the
narrative
of
their
discoveries
he
says
the
next
day
we
ascended
in
our
pinnace
that
part
of
the
river
which
lies
more
to
the
westward
carrying
with
us
a
cross
a
thing
never
omitted
by
any
christian
traveler
which
we
erected
at
the
ultimate
end
of
our
route
this
was
in
the
year
and
in
i
obeyed
the
feeling
of
early
travelers
and
left
the
impression
of
the
cross
deeply
engraved
on
the
vast
rock
one
thousand
miles
beyond
the
mississippi
to
which
discoverers
have
given
the
national
name
of
in
obedience
to
my
instructions
to
survey
the
river
platte
if
possible
i
had
determined
to
make
an
attempt
at
this
place
the
boat
was
filled
with
air
placed
in
the
water
and
loaded
with
what
was
necessary
for
our
operations
and
i
embarked
with
preuss
and
a
party
of
men
when
we
had
dragged
our
boat
a
mile
or
two
over
the
sands
i
abandoned
the
impossible
undertaking
and
waited
for
the
arrival
of
the
party
when
we
packed
up
our
boat
and
equipage
and
at
nine
were
again
moving
along
on
our
land
journey
we
continued
along
the
valley
on
the
right
bank
of
the
sweet
water
where
the
formation
as
already
described
consists
of
a
grayish
micaceous
sandstone
and
conglomerate
and
marl
we
passed
over
a
ridge
which
borders
or
constitutes
the
river
hills
of
the
platte
consisting
of
huge
blocks
sixty
or
eighty
feet
cube
of
decomposing
granite
the
cement
which
united
them
was
probably
of
easier
decomposition
and
has
disappeared
and
left
them
isolate
and
separated
by
small
spaces
numerous
horns
of
the
were
lying
among
the
rocks
and
in
the
ravines
were
cedars
whose
trunks
were
of
extraordinary
size
from
this
ridge
we
descended
to
a
small
open
plain
at
the
mouth
of
the
sweet
water
which
rushed
with
a
rapid
current
into
the
platte
here
flowing
along
in
a
broad
and
apparently
deep
stream
which
seemed
from
its
turbid
appearance
to
be
considerably
swollen
i
obtained
here
some
astronomical
observations
and
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
getting
our
boat
ready
for
navigation
the
next
day
we
started
before
sunrise
intending
to
breakfast
at
goat
island
i
had
directed
the
land
party
in
charge
of
bernier
to
proceed
to
this
place
where
they
were
to
remain
should
they
find
no
note
to
apprize
them
of
our
having
passed
in
the
event
of
receiving
this
information
they
were
to
continue
their
route
passing
by
certain
places
which
had
been
designated
preuss
accompanied
me
and
with
us
were
five
of
my
best
men
viz
lambert
basil
lajeunesse
honore
ayot
benoist
and
descoteaux
here
appeared
no
scarcity
of
water
and
we
took
on
board
with
various
instruments
and
baggage
provisions
for
ten
or
twelve
days
we
paddled
down
the
river
rapidly
for
our
little
craft
was
light
as
a
duck
on
the
water
and
the
sun
had
been
some
time
risen
when
we
heard
before
us
a
hollow
roar
which
we
supposed
to
be
that
of
a
fall
of
which
we
had
heard
a
vague
rumor
but
whose
exact
locality
no
one
had
been
able
to
describe
to
us
we
were
approaching
a
ridge
through
which
the
river
passes
by
a
place
called
canon
pronounced
a
spanish
word
signifying
a
piece
of
artillery
the
barrel
of
a
gun
or
any
kind
of
tube
and
which
in
this
country
has
been
adopted
to
describe
the
passage
of
a
river
between
perpendicular
rocks
of
great
height
which
frequently
approach
each
other
so
closely
overhead
as
to
form
a
kind
of
tunnel
over
the
stream
which
foams
along
below
half
choked
up
by
fallen
fragments
between
the
mouth
of
the
sweet
water
and
goat
island
there
is
probably
a
fall
of
three
hundred
feet
and
that
was
principally
made
in
the
canons
before
us
as
without
them
the
water
was
comparatively
smooth
as
we
neared
the
ridge
the
river
made
a
sudden
turn
and
swept
squarely
down
against
one
of
the
walls
of
the
canon
with
great
velocity
and
so
steep
a
descent
that
it
had
to
the
eye
the
appearance
of
an
inclined
plane
when
we
launched
into
this
the
men
jumped
overboard
to
check
the
velocity
of
the
boat
but
were
soon
in
water
up
to
their
necks
and
our
boat
ran
on
but
we
succeeded
in
bringing
her
to
a
small
point
of
rocks
on
the
right
at
the
mouth
of
the
canon
here
was
a
kind
of
elevated
not
many
yards
square
backed
by
the
rocks
and
around
the
point
the
river
swept
at
a
right
angle
trunks
of
trees
deposited
on
jutting
points
twenty
or
thirty
feet
above
and
other
marks
showed
that
the
water
here
frequently
rose
to
a
considerable
height
the
ridge
was
of
the
same
decomposing
granite
already
mentioned
and
the
water
had
worked
the
surface
in
many
places
into
a
wavy
surface
of
ridges
and
holes
we
ascended
the
rocks
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
and
from
the
summit
the
passage
appeared
to
be
a
continued
cataract
foaming
over
many
obstructions
and
broken
by
a
number
of
small
falls
we
saw
nowhere
a
fall
answering
to
that
which
had
been
described
to
us
as
having
twenty
or
feet
but
still
concluded
this
to
be
the
place
in
question
as
in
the
season
of
floods
the
rush
of
the
river
against
the
wall
would
produce
a
great
rise
and
the
waters
reflected
squarely
off
would
descend
through
the
passage
in
a
sheet
of
foam
having
every
appearance
of
a
large
fall
eighteen
years
previous
to
this
time
as
i
have
subsequently
learned
from
himself
fitzpatrick
somewhere
above
on
this
river
had
embarked
with
a
valuable
cargo
of
beaver
unacquainted
with
the
stream
which
he
believed
would
conduct
him
safely
to
the
missouri
he
came
unexpectedly
into
this
canon
where
he
was
wrecked
with
the
total
loss
of
his
furs
it
would
have
been
a
work
of
great
time
and
labor
to
pack
our
baggage
across
the
ridge
and
i
determined
to
run
the
canon
we
all
again
embarked
and
at
first
attempted
to
check
the
way
of
the
boat
but
the
water
swept
through
with
so
much
violence
that
we
narrowly
escaped
being
swamped
and
were
obliged
to
let
her
go
in
the
full
force
of
the
current
and
trust
to
the
skill
of
the
boatmen
the
dangerous
places
in
this
canon
were
where
huge
rocks
had
fallen
from
above
and
hemmed
in
the
already
narrow
pass
of
the
river
to
an
open
space
of
three
or
four
and
five
feet
these
obstructions
raised
the
water
considerably
above
which
was
sometimes
precipitated
over
in
a
fall
and
at
other
places
where
this
dam
was
too
high
rushed
through
the
contracted
opening
with
tremendous
violence
had
our
boat
been
made
of
wood
in
passing
the
narrows
she
would
have
been
staved
but
her
elasticity
preserved
her
unhurt
from
every
shock
and
she
seemed
fairly
to
leap
over
the
falls
in
this
way
we
passed
three
cataracts
in
succession
where
perhaps
feet
of
smooth
water
intervened
and
finally
with
a
shout
of
pleasure
at
our
success
issued
from
our
tunnel
into
the
open
day
beyond
we
were
so
delighted
with
the
performance
of
our
boat
and
so
confident
in
her
powers
that
we
would
not
have
hesitated
to
leap
a
fall
of
ten
feet
with
her
we
put
to
shore
for
breakfast
at
some
willows
on
the
right
bank
immediately
below
the
mouth
of
the
canon
for
it
was
now
eight
and
we
had
been
working
since
daylight
and
were
all
wet
fatigued
and
hungry
while
the
men
were
preparing
breakfast
i
went
out
to
reconnoitre
the
view
was
very
limited
the
course
of
the
river
was
smooth
so
far
as
i
could
see
on
both
sides
were
broken
hills
and
but
a
mile
or
two
below
was
another
high
ridge
the
rock
at
the
mouth
of
the
canon
was
still
the
decomposing
granite
with
great
quantities
of
mica
which
made
a
very
glittering
sand
we
at
nine
and
in
about
twenty
minutes
reached
the
next
canon
landing
on
a
rocky
shore
at
its
commencement
we
ascended
the
ridge
to
reconnoitre
portage
was
out
of
the
question
so
far
as
we
could
see
the
jagged
rocks
pointed
out
the
course
of
the
canon
on
a
winding
line
of
seven
or
eight
miles
it
was
simply
a
narrow
dark
chasm
in
the
rock
and
here
the
perpendicular
faces
were
much
higher
than
in
the
previous
pass
being
at
this
end
two
to
three
hundred
and
further
down
as
we
afterwards
ascertained
five
hundred
feet
in
vertical
height
our
previous
success
had
made
us
bold
and
we
determined
again
to
run
the
canon
every
thing
was
secured
as
firmly
as
possible
and
having
divested
ourselves
of
the
greater
part
of
our
clothing
we
pushed
into
the
stream
to
save
our
chronometer
from
accident
preuss
took
it
and
attempted
to
proceed
along
the
shore
on
the
masses
of
rock
which
in
places
were
piled
up
on
either
side
but
after
he
had
walked
about
five
minutes
every
thing
like
shore
disappeared
and
the
vertical
wall
came
squarely
down
into
the
water
he
therefore
waited
until
we
came
up
an
ugly
pass
lay
before
us
we
had
made
fast
to
the
stern
of
the
boat
a
strong
rope
about
fifty
feet
long
and
three
of
the
men
clambered
along
among
the
rocks
and
with
this
rope
let
her
slowly
through
the
pass
in
several
places
high
rocks
lay
scattered
about
in
the
channel
and
in
the
narrows
it
required
all
our
strength
and
skill
to
avoid
staving
the
boat
on
the
sharp
points
in
one
of
these
the
boat
proved
a
little
too
broad
and
stuck
fast
for
an
instant
while
the
water
flew
over
us
fortunately
it
was
but
for
an
instant
as
our
united
strength
forced
her
immediately
through
the
water
swept
overboard
only
a
sextant
and
a
pair
of
i
caught
the
sextant
as
it
passed
by
me
but
the
became
the
prey
of
the
whirlpools
we
reached
the
place
where
preuss
was
standing
took
him
on
board
and
with
the
aid
of
the
boat
put
the
men
with
the
rope
on
the
succeeding
pile
of
rocks
we
found
this
passage
much
worse
than
the
previous
one
and
our
position
was
rather
a
bad
one
to
go
back
was
impossible
before
us
the
cataract
was
a
sheet
of
foam
and
shut
up
in
the
chasm
by
the
rocks
which
in
some
places
seemed
almost
to
meet
overhead
the
roar
of
the
water
was
deafening
we
pushed
off
again
but
after
making
a
little
distance
the
force
of
the
current
became
too
great
for
the
men
on
shore
and
two
of
them
let
go
the
rope
lajeunesse
the
third
man
hung
on
and
was
jerked
headforemost
into
the
river
from
a
rock
about
twelve
feet
high
and
down
the
boat
shot
like
an
arrow
basil
following
us
in
the
rapid
current
and
exerting
all
his
strength
to
keep
in
mid
channel
his
head
only
seen
occasionally
like
a
black
spot
in
the
white
foam
how
far
we
went
i
do
not
exactly
know
but
we
succeeded
in
turning
the
boat
into
an
eddy
below
said
basil
lajeunesse
as
he
arrived
immediately
after
us
crois
bien
que
nagé
un
demi
he
had
owed
his
life
to
his
skill
as
a
swimmer
and
i
determined
to
take
him
and
the
two
others
on
board
and
trust
to
skill
and
fortune
to
reach
the
other
end
in
safety
we
placed
ourselves
on
our
knees
with
the
short
paddles
in
our
hands
the
most
skilful
boatman
being
at
the
bow
and
again
we
commenced
our
rapid
descent
we
cleared
rock
after
rock
and
shot
past
fall
after
fall
our
little
boat
seeming
to
play
with
the
cataract
we
became
flushed
with
success
and
familiar
with
the
danger
and
yielding
to
the
excitement
of
the
occasion
broke
forth
into
a
canadian
singing
or
rather
shouting
we
dashed
along
and
were
i
believe
in
the
midst
of
the
chorus
when
the
boat
struck
a
concealed
rock
immediately
at
the
foot
of
a
fall
which
whirled
her
over
in
an
instant
three
of
my
men
could
not
swim
and
my
first
feeling
was
to
assist
them
and
save
some
of
our
effects
but
a
sharp
concussion
or
two
convinced
me
that
i
had
not
yet
saved
myself
a
few
strokes
brought
me
into
an
eddy
and
i
landed
on
a
pile
of
rocks
on
the
left
side
looking
around
i
saw
that
preuss
had
gained
the
shore
on
the
same
side
about
twenty
yards
below
and
a
little
climbing
and
swimming
soon
brought
him
to
my
side
on
the
opposite
side
against
the
wall
lay
the
boat
bottom
up
and
lambert
was
in
the
act
of
saving
descoteaux
whom
he
had
grasped
by
the
hair
and
who
could
not
swim
said
he
as
i
afterwards
learned
pas
cher
was
the
reply
vais
mourir
avant
que
de
te
such
was
the
reply
of
courage
and
generosity
in
this
danger
for
a
hundred
yards
below
the
current
was
covered
with
floating
books
and
boxes
bales
and
blankets
and
scattered
articles
of
clothing
and
so
strong
and
boiling
was
the
stream
that
even
our
heavy
instruments
which
were
all
in
cases
kept
on
the
surface
and
the
sextant
circle
and
the
long
black
box
of
the
telescope
were
in
view
at
once
for
a
moment
i
felt
somewhat
disheartened
all
our
books
almost
every
record
of
the
journey
our
journals
and
registers
of
astronomical
and
barometrical
observations
had
been
lost
in
a
moment
but
it
was
no
time
to
indulge
in
regrets
and
i
immediately
set
about
endeavoring
to
save
something
from
the
wreck
making
ourselves
understood
as
well
as
possible
by
signs
for
nothing
could
be
heard
in
the
roar
of
the
waters
we
commenced
our
operations
of
every
thing
on
board
the
only
article
that
had
been
saved
was
my
gun
which
descoteaux
had
caught
and
clung
to
with
drowning
tenacity
the
men
continued
down
the
river
on
the
left
bank
preuss
and
myself
descended
on
the
side
we
were
on
and
lajeunesse
with
a
paddle
in
his
hand
jumped
on
the
boat
alone
and
continued
down
the
canon
she
was
now
light
and
cleared
every
bad
place
with
much
less
difficulty
in
a
short
time
he
was
joined
by
lambert
and
the
search
was
continued
for
about
a
mile
and
a
half
which
was
as
far
as
the
boat
could
proceed
in
the
pass
here
the
walls
were
about
five
hundred
feet
high
and
the
fragments
of
rocks
from
above
had
choked
the
river
into
a
hollow
pass
but
one
or
two
feet
above
the
surface
through
this
and
the
interstices
of
the
rock
the
water
found
its
way
favored
beyond
our
expectations
all
of
our
registers
had
been
recovered
with
the
exception
of
one
of
my
journals
which
contained
the
notes
and
incidents
of
travel
and
topographical
descriptions
a
number
of
scattered
astronomical
observations
principally
meridian
altitudes
of
the
sun
and
our
barometrical
register
west
of
laramie
fortunately
our
other
journals
contained
duplicates
of
the
most
important
barometrical
observations
which
had
been
taken
in
the
mountains
these
with
a
few
scattered
notes
were
all
that
had
been
preserved
of
our
meteorological
observations
in
addition
to
these
we
saved
the
circle
and
these
with
a
few
blankets
constituted
every
thing
that
had
been
rescued
from
the
waters
the
day
was
running
rapidly
away
and
it
was
necessary
to
reach
goat
island
whither
the
party
had
preceded
us
before
night
in
this
uncertain
country
the
traveler
is
so
much
in
the
power
of
chance
that
we
became
somewhat
uneasy
in
regard
to
them
should
any
thing
have
occurred
in
the
brief
interval
of
our
separation
to
prevent
our
rejoining
them
our
situation
would
be
rather
a
desperate
one
we
had
not
a
morsel
of
provisions
our
arms
and
ammunition
were
gone
and
we
were
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
any
straggling
party
of
savages
and
not
a
little
in
danger
of
starvation
we
therefore
set
out
at
once
in
two
parties
preuss
and
myself
on
the
left
and
the
men
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
climbing
out
of
the
canon
we
found
ourselves
in
a
very
broken
country
where
we
were
not
yet
able
to
recognise
any
locality
in
the
course
of
our
descent
through
the
canon
the
rocks
which
at
the
upper
end
was
of
the
decomposing
granite
changed
into
a
varied
sandstone
formation
the
hills
and
points
of
the
ridges
were
covered
with
fragments
of
a
yellow
sandstone
of
which
the
strata
were
sometimes
displayed
in
the
broken
ravines
which
interrupted
our
course
and
made
our
walk
extremely
fatiguing
at
one
point
of
the
canon
the
red
argillaceous
sandstone
rose
in
a
wall
of
five
hundred
feet
surmounted
by
a
stratum
of
white
sandstone
and
in
an
opposite
ravine
a
column
of
red
sandstone
rose
in
form
like
a
steeple
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
the
scenery
was
extremely
picturesque
and
notwithstanding
our
forlorn
condition
we
were
frequently
obliged
to
stop
and
admire
it
our
progress
was
not
very
rapid
we
had
emerged
from
the
water
half
naked
and
on
arriving
at
the
top
of
the
precipice
i
found
myself
with
only
one
moccasin
the
fragments
of
rock
made
walking
painful
and
i
was
frequently
obliged
to
stop
and
pull
out
the
thorns
of
the
here
the
prevailing
plant
and
with
which
a
few
minutes
walk
covered
the
bottoms
of
my
feet
from
this
ridge
the
river
emerged
into
a
smiling
prairie
and
descending
to
the
bank
for
water
we
were
joined
by
benoist
the
rest
of
the
party
were
out
of
sight
having
taken
a
more
inland
route
we
crossed
the
river
repeatedly
sometimes
able
to
ford
it
and
sometimes
swimming
climbed
over
the
ridges
of
two
more
canons
and
towards
evening
reached
the
cut
which
we
here
named
the
hot
spring
gate
on
our
previous
visit
in
july
we
had
not
entered
this
pass
reserving
it
for
our
descent
in
the
boat
and
when
we
entered
it
this
evening
preuss
was
a
few
hundred
feet
in
advance
heated
with
the
long
march
he
came
suddenly
upon
a
fine
bold
spring
gushing
from
the
rock
about
ten
feet
above
the
river
eager
to
enjoy
the
crystal
water
he
threw
himself
down
for
a
hasty
draught
and
took
a
mouthful
of
water
almost
boiling
hot
he
said
nothing
to
benoist
who
laid
himself
down
to
drink
but
the
steam
from
the
water
arrested
his
eagerness
and
he
escaped
the
hot
draught
we
had
no
thermometer
to
ascertain
the
temperature
but
i
could
hold
my
hand
in
the
water
just
long
enough
to
count
two
seconds
there
are
eight
or
ten
of
these
springs
discharging
themselves
by
streams
large
enough
to
be
called
runs
a
loud
hollow
noise
was
heard
from
the
rock
which
i
supposed
to
be
produced
by
the
fall
of
water
the
strata
immediately
where
they
issue
is
a
fine
white
and
calcareous
sandstone
covered
with
an
incrustation
of
common
salt
leaving
this
thermopylæ
of
the
west
in
a
short
walk
we
reached
the
red
ridge
which
has
been
described
as
lying
just
above
goat
island
ascending
this
we
found
some
fresh
tracks
and
a
button
which
showed
that
the
other
men
had
already
arrived
a
shout
from
the
man
who
first
reached
the
top
of
the
ridge
responded
to
from
below
informed
us
that
our
friends
were
all
on
the
island
and
we
were
soon
among
them
we
found
some
pieces
of
buffalo
standing
around
the
fire
for
us
and
managed
to
get
some
dry
clothes
among
the
people
a
sudden
storm
of
rain
drove
us
into
the
best
shelter
we
could
find
where
we
slept
soundly
after
one
of
the
most
fatiguing
days
i
have
ever
experienced
early
this
morning
lajeunesse
was
sent
to
the
wreck
for
the
articles
which
had
been
saved
and
about
noon
we
left
the
island
the
mare
which
we
had
left
here
in
july
had
much
improved
in
condition
and
she
served
us
well
again
for
some
time
but
was
finally
abandoned
at
a
subsequent
part
of
the
journey
at
in
the
morning
of
the
we
reached
cache
camp
where
we
found
every
thing
undisturbed
we
disinterred
our
deposite
arranged
our
carts
which
had
been
left
here
on
the
way
out
and
traveling
a
few
miles
in
the
afternoon
encamped
for
the
night
at
the
ford
of
the
platte
at
we
halted
at
the
place
where
we
had
taken
dinner
on
the
of
july
the
country
which
when
we
passed
up
looked
as
if
the
hard
winter
frosts
had
passed
over
it
had
now
assumed
a
new
face
so
much
of
vernal
freshness
had
been
given
to
it
by
the
rains
the
platte
was
exceedingly
low
a
mere
line
of
water
among
the
sandbars
we
reached
laramie
fort
on
the
last
day
of
august
after
an
absence
of
days
and
had
the
pleasure
to
find
our
friends
all
well
the
fortieth
day
had
been
fixed
for
our
return
and
the
quick
eyes
of
the
indians
who
were
on
the
lookout
for
us
discovered
our
flag
as
we
wound
among
the
hills
the
fort
saluted
us
with
repeated
discharges
of
its
single
piece
which
we
returned
with
scattered
volleys
of
our
and
felt
the
joy
of
a
home
reception
in
getting
back
to
this
remote
station
which
seemed
so
far
off
as
we
went
out
september
on
the
morning
of
the
september
we
bade
adieu
to
our
kind
friends
at
the
fort
and
continued
our
homeward
journey
down
the
platte
which
was
glorious
with
the
autumnal
splendor
of
innumerable
flowers
in
full
and
brilliant
bloom
on
the
warm
sands
among
the
one
of
the
characteristic
plants
we
saw
great
numbers
of
rattlesnakes
of
which
five
or
six
were
killed
in
the
morning
ride
we
occupied
ourselves
in
improving
our
previous
survey
of
the
river
and
as
the
weather
was
fine
astronomical
observations
were
generally
made
at
night
and
at
noon
we
halted
for
a
short
time
on
the
afternoon
of
the
with
a
village
of
sioux
indians
some
of
whose
chiefs
we
had
met
at
laramie
the
water
in
the
platte
was
exceedingly
low
in
many
places
the
large
expanse
of
sands
with
some
occasional
stunted
tree
on
its
banks
gave
it
the
air
of
the
seacoast
the
bed
of
the
river
being
merely
a
succession
of
sandbars
among
which
the
channel
was
divided
into
rivulets
of
a
few
inches
deep
we
crossed
and
recrossed
with
our
carts
repeatedly
and
at
our
pleasure
and
whenever
an
obstruction
barred
our
way
in
the
shape
of
precipitous
bluffs
that
came
down
upon
the
river
we
turned
directly
into
it
and
made
our
way
along
the
sandy
bed
with
no
other
inconvenience
than
the
frequent
quicksands
which
greatly
fatigued
our
animals
disinterring
on
the
way
the
which
had
been
made
by
our
party
when
they
ascended
the
river
we
reached
without
accident
on
the
evening
of
the
of
september
our
old
encampment
of
the
of
july
at
the
junction
of
the
forks
our
of
the
barrel
of
pork
was
found
undisturbed
and
proved
a
seasonable
addition
to
our
stock
of
provisions
at
this
place
i
had
determined
to
make
another
attempt
to
descend
the
platte
by
water
and
accordingly
spent
two
days
in
the
construction
of
a
bull
boat
men
were
sent
out
on
the
evening
of
our
arrival
the
necessary
number
of
bulls
killed
and
their
skins
brought
to
the
camp
four
of
the
best
of
them
were
strongly
sewed
together
with
buffalo
sinew
and
stretched
over
a
basket
frame
of
willow
the
seams
were
then
covered
with
ashes
and
tallow
and
the
boat
left
exposed
to
the
sun
for
the
greater
part
of
one
day
which
was
sufficient
to
dry
and
contract
the
skin
and
make
the
whole
work
solid
and
strong
it
had
a
rounded
bow
was
eight
feet
long
and
five
broad
and
drew
with
four
men
about
four
inches
water
on
the
morning
of
the
we
embarked
in
our
hide
boat
preuss
and
myself
with
two
men
we
dragged
her
over
the
sands
for
three
or
four
miles
and
then
left
her
on
a
bar
and
abandoned
entirely
all
further
attempts
to
navigate
this
river
the
names
given
by
the
indians
are
always
remarkably
appropriate
and
certainly
none
was
ever
more
so
than
that
which
they
have
given
to
this
stream
the
nebraska
or
shallow
river
walking
steadily
the
remainder
of
the
day
a
little
before
dark
we
overtook
our
people
at
their
remaining
camp
about
miles
below
the
junction
the
next
morning
we
crossed
the
platte
and
continued
our
way
down
the
river
bottom
on
the
left
bank
where
we
found
an
excellent
road
on
the
we
reached
grand
island
which
is
miles
long
with
an
average
breadth
of
one
mile
and
it
has
on
it
some
small
eminences
and
is
sufficiently
elevated
to
be
secure
from
the
annual
floods
of
the
river
as
has
been
already
remarked
it
is
well
timbered
with
an
excellent
soil
and
recommends
itself
to
notice
as
the
best
point
for
a
military
position
on
the
lower
platte
on
the
we
arrived
at
the
village
of
the
grand
pawnees
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
about
thirty
miles
above
the
mouth
of
the
loup
fork
they
were
gathering
in
their
corn
and
we
obtained
from
them
a
very
welcome
supply
of
vegetables
the
morning
of
the
we
reached
the
loup
fork
of
the
platte
at
the
place
where
we
forded
it
this
stream
was
four
hundred
and
thirty
yards
broad
with
a
swift
current
of
water
in
this
respect
differing
from
the
platte
which
has
a
yellow
muddy
color
derived
from
the
limestone
and
marl
formation
of
which
we
have
previously
spoken
the
ford
was
difficult
as
the
water
was
so
deep
that
it
came
into
the
body
of
the
carts
and
we
reached
the
opposite
bank
after
repeated
attempts
ascending
and
descending
the
bed
of
the
river
in
order
to
avail
ourselves
of
the
bars
we
encamped
on
the
left
bank
of
the
fork
in
the
point
of
land
at
its
junction
with
the
platte
during
the
two
days
that
we
remained
here
for
astronomical
observations
the
bad
weather
permitted
us
to
obtain
but
one
good
observation
for
the
latitude
a
meridian
altitude
of
the
sun
which
gave
for
the
latitude
of
the
mouth
of
the
loup
fork
five
or
six
days
previously
i
had
sent
forward
lambert
with
two
men
to
bellevue
with
directions
to
ask
from
sarpy
the
gentleman
in
charge
of
the
american
company
establishment
at
that
place
the
aid
of
his
carpenters
in
constructing
a
boat
in
which
i
proposed
to
descend
the
missouri
on
the
afternoon
of
the
we
met
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
dispatched
by
sarpy
with
a
welcome
supply
of
provisions
and
a
very
kind
note
which
gave
us
the
very
gratifying
intelligence
that
our
boat
was
in
rapid
progress
on
the
evening
of
the
we
encamped
in
an
almost
impenetrable
undergrowth
on
the
left
bank
of
the
platte
in
the
point
of
land
at
its
confluence
with
the
missouri
miles
according
to
our
reckoning
from
the
junction
of
the
forks
and
from
fort
laramie
from
the
junction
we
had
found
the
bed
of
the
platte
occupied
with
numerous
islands
many
of
them
very
large
and
all
well
timbered
possessing
as
well
as
the
bottom
lands
of
the
river
a
very
excellent
soil
with
the
exception
of
some
scattered
groves
on
the
banks
the
bottoms
are
generally
without
timber
a
portion
of
these
consist
of
low
grounds
covered
with
a
profusion
of
fine
grasses
and
are
probably
inundated
in
the
spring
the
remaining
part
is
high
river
prairie
entirely
beyond
the
influence
of
the
floods
the
breadth
of
the
river
is
usually
of
a
mile
except
where
it
is
enlarged
by
islands
that
portion
of
its
course
which
is
occupied
by
grand
island
has
an
average
breadth
from
shore
to
shore
of
two
and
a
half
miles
october
i
rose
this
morning
long
before
daylight
and
heard
with
a
feeling
of
pleasure
the
tinkling
of
at
the
settlements
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
missouri
early
in
the
day
we
reached
residence
and
in
the
security
and
comfort
of
his
hospitable
mansion
felt
the
pleasure
of
being
within
the
pale
of
civilization
we
found
our
boat
on
the
stocks
a
few
days
sufficed
to
complete
her
and
in
the
afternoon
of
the
we
embarked
on
the
missouri
all
our
equipage
horses
carts
and
the
of
the
camp
had
been
sold
at
public
auction
at
bellevue
the
strength
of
my
party
enabled
me
to
man
the
boat
with
ten
oars
relieved
every
hour
and
we
descended
rapidly
early
on
the
morning
of
the
we
halted
to
make
some
astronomical
observations
at
the
mouth
of
the
kansas
exactly
four
months
since
we
had
left
the
of
cyprian
chouteau
on
the
same
river
ten
miles
above
on
our
descent
to
this
place
we
had
employed
ourselves
in
surveying
and
sketching
the
missouri
making
astronomical
observations
regularly
at
night
and
at
whenever
the
weather
permitted
these
operations
on
the
river
were
continued
until
our
arrival
at
the

possible
i
determined
in
conformity
to
your
general
instructions
to
vary
the
route
to
the
rocky
mountains
from
that
followed
in
the
route
was
then
up
the
valley
of
the
great
platte
river
to
the
south
pass
in
north
latitude
the
route
now
determined
on
was
up
the
valley
of
the
kansas
river
and
to
the
head
of
the
arkansas
river
and
to
some
pass
in
the
mountains
if
any
could
be
found
at
the
sources
of
that
river
by
making
this
deviation
from
the
former
route
the
problem
of
a
new
road
to
oregon
and
california
in
a
climate
more
genial
might
be
solved
and
a
better
knowledge
obtained
of
an
important
river
and
the
country
it
drained
while
the
great
object
of
the
expedition
would
find
its
point
of
commencement
at
the
termination
of
the
former
which
was
at
that
great
gate
in
the
ridge
of
the
rocky
mountains
called
the
south
pass
and
on
the
lofty
peak
of
the
mountain
which
overlooks
it
deemed
the
highest
peak
in
the
ridge
and
from
the
opposite
side
of
which
four
great
rivers
take
their
rise
and
flow
to
the
pacific
or
the
mississippi
various
obstacles
delayed
our
departure
until
the
morning
of
the
when
we
commenced
our
long
voyage
and
at
the
close
of
a
day
rendered
disagreeably
cold
by
incessant
rain
encamped
about
four
miles
beyond
the
frontier
on
the
verge
of
the
great
prairies
resuming
our
journey
on
the
after
the
delay
of
a
day
to
complete
our
equipment
and
furnish
ourselves
with
some
of
the
comforts
of
civilized
life
we
encamped
in
the
evening
at
elm
grove
in
company
with
several
emigrant
wagons
constituting
a
party
which
was
proceeding
to
upper
california
under
the
direction
of
childs
of
missouri
the
wagons
were
variously
freighted
with
goods
furniture
and
farming
utensils
containing
among
other
things
an
entire
set
of
machinery
for
a
mill
which
childs
designed
erecting
on
the
waters
of
the
sacramento
river
emptying
into
the
bay
of
san
francisco
we
were
joined
here
by
wm
gilpin
of
who
intending
this
year
to
visit
the
settlements
in
oregon
had
been
invited
to
accompany
us
and
proved
a
useful
and
agreeable
addition
to
the
party
june
from
elm
grove
our
route
until
the
third
of
june
was
nearly
the
same
as
that
described
to
you
in
trains
of
wagons
were
almost
constantly
in
sight
giving
to
the
road
a
populous
and
animated
appearance
although
the
greater
portion
of
the
emigrants
were
collected
at
the
crossing
or
already
on
their
march
beyond
the
kansas
river
leaving
at
the
ford
the
usual
emigrant
road
to
the
mountains
we
continued
our
route
along
the
southern
side
of
the
kansas
where
we
found
the
country
much
more
broken
than
on
the
northern
side
of
the
river
and
where
our
progress
was
much
delayed
by
the
numerous
small
streams
which
obliged
us
to
make
frequent
bridges
on
the
morning
of
the
we
crossed
a
handsome
stream
called
by
the
indians
otter
creek
about
feet
wide
where
a
flat
stratum
of
limestone
which
forms
the
bed
made
an
excellent
ford
we
met
here
a
small
party
of
kansas
and
delaware
indians
the
latter
returning
from
a
hunting
and
trapping
expedition
on
the
upper
waters
of
the
river
and
on
the
heights
above
were
five
or
six
kansas
women
engaged
in
digging
prairie
potatoes
on
the
afternoon
of
the
whilst
busily
engaged
in
crossing
a
wooded
stream
we
were
thrown
into
a
little
confusion
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
maxwell
who
entered
the
camp
at
full
speed
at
the
head
of
a
war
party
of
osage
indians
with
gay
red
blankets
and
heads
shaved
to
the
scalp
lock
they
had
run
him
a
distance
of
about
nine
miles
from
a
creek
on
which
we
had
encamped
the
day
previous
and
to
which
he
had
returned
in
search
of
a
runaway
horse
belonging
to
dwight
which
had
taken
the
homeward
road
carrying
with
him
saddle
bridle
and
the
osages
were
probably
ignorant
of
our
strength
and
when
they
charged
into
the
camp
drove
off
a
number
of
our
best
horses
but
we
were
fortunately
well
mounted
and
after
a
hard
chase
of
seven
or
eight
miles
succeeded
in
recovering
them
all
this
accident
which
occasioned
delay
and
trouble
and
threatened
danger
and
loss
and
broke
down
some
good
horses
at
the
start
and
actually
endangered
the
expedition
was
a
first
fruit
of
having
gentlemen
in
company
very
estimable
to
be
sure
but
who
are
not
trained
to
the
care
and
vigilance
and
which
such
an
expedition
required
and
who
are
not
subject
to
the
orders
which
enforce
attention
and
exertion
we
arrived
on
the
at
the
mouth
of
the
fork
which
is
the
principal
southern
branch
of
the
kansas
forming
here
by
its
junction
with
the
republican
or
northern
branch
the
main
kansas
river
neither
stream
was
fordable
and
the
necessity
of
making
a
raft
together
with
bad
weather
detained
us
here
until
the
morning
of
the
when
we
resumed
our
journey
along
the
republican
fork
by
our
observations
the
junction
of
the
streams
is
in
lat
long
and
at
an
elevation
of
feet
above
the
gulf
of
mexico
for
several
days
we
continued
to
travel
along
the
republican
through
a
country
beautifully
watered
with
numerous
streams
and
handsomely
timbered
and
rarely
an
incident
occurred
to
vary
the
monotonous
resemblance
which
one
day
on
the
prairies
here
bears
to
another
and
which
scarcely
require
a
particular
description
now
and
then
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
small
herd
of
elk
and
occasionally
a
band
of
antelopes
whose
curiosity
sometimes
brought
them
within
rifle
range
would
circle
round
us
and
then
scour
off
into
the
prairies
as
we
advanced
on
our
road
these
became
more
frequent
but
as
we
journeyed
on
the
line
usually
followed
by
the
trapping
and
hunting
parties
of
the
kansas
and
delaware
indians
game
of
every
kind
continued
very
shy
and
wild
the
bottoms
which
form
the
immediate
valley
of
the
main
river
were
generally
about
three
miles
wide
having
a
rich
soil
of
black
vegetable
mould
and
for
a
prairie
country
well
interspersed
with
wood
the
country
was
everywhere
covered
with
a
considerable
variety
of
grasses
occasionally
poor
and
thin
but
far
more
frequently
luxuriant
and
rich
we
had
been
gradually
and
regularly
ascending
in
our
progress
westward
and
on
the
evening
of
the
when
we
encamped
on
a
little
creek
in
the
valley
of
the
republican
miles
by
our
traveling
road
from
the
mouth
of
the
kansas
we
were
at
an
elevation
of
feet
that
part
of
the
river
where
we
were
now
encamped
is
called
by
the
indians
the
hitherto
our
route
had
been
laborious
and
extremely
slow
the
unusually
wet
spring
and
constant
rain
having
so
saturated
the
whole
country
that
it
was
necessary
to
bridge
every
and
for
days
together
our
usual
march
averaged
only
five
or
six
miles
finding
that
at
such
a
rate
of
travel
it
would
be
impossible
to
comply
with
your
instructions
i
determined
at
this
place
to
divide
the
party
and
leaving
fitzpatrick
with
men
in
charge
of
the
provisions
and
heavier
baggage
of
the
camp
to
proceed
myself
in
advance
with
a
light
party
of
fifteen
men
taking
with
me
the
howitzer
and
the
light
wagon
which
carried
the
instruments
accordingly
on
the
morning
of
the
the
parties
separated
and
bearing
a
little
out
from
the
river
with
a
view
of
heading
some
of
the
numerous
affluents
after
a
few
hours
travel
over
somewhat
broken
ground
we
entered
upon
an
extensive
and
high
level
prairie
on
which
we
encamped
towards
evening
at
a
little
stream
where
a
single
dry
cottonwood
afforded
the
necessary
fuel
for
preparing
supper
among
a
variety
of
grasses
which
made
their
first
appearance
i
noticed
and
amorpha
canescens
continued
the
characteristic
plant
of
the
country
and
a
occurred
during
the
morning
in
beautiful
patches
occurred
frequently
with
a
near
and
a
number
of
plants
not
hitherto
met
just
verging
into
bloom
the
water
on
which
we
had
encamped
belonged
to
solomon
fort
of
the
river
along
whose
tributaries
we
continued
to
travel
for
several
days
the
country
afforded
us
an
excellent
road
the
route
being
generally
over
high
and
very
level
prairies
and
we
met
with
no
other
delay
than
being
frequently
obliged
to
bridge
one
of
the
numerous
streams
which
were
well
timbered
with
ash
elm
cottonwood
and
a
very
large
oak
the
latter
being
occasionally
five
and
six
feet
in
diameter
with
a
spreading
summit
is
very
frequent
in
patches
on
the
high
and
low
prairie
and
i
remarked
that
it
has
a
very
pleasant
perfume
the
wild
sensitive
plant
occurs
frequently
generally
on
the
dry
prairies
in
valleys
of
streams
and
frequently
on
the
broken
prairie
bank
i
remark
that
the
leaflets
close
instantly
to
a
very
light
touch
with
the
same
and
a
dwarf
species
of
are
the
characteristic
plants
on
the
in
the
afternoon
we
crossed
the
pawnee
road
to
the
arkansas
and
traveling
a
few
miles
onward
the
monotony
of
the
prairies
was
suddenly
dispelled
by
the
appearance
of
five
or
six
buffalo
bulls
forming
a
vanguard
of
immense
herds
among
which
we
were
traveling
a
few
days
afterwards
prairie
dogs
were
seen
for
the
first
time
during
the
day
and
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
obtain
an
antelope
for
supper
our
elevation
had
now
increased
to
feet
was
the
characteristic
on
the
creek
bottoms
and
buffalo
grass
is
becoming
abundant
on
the
higher
parts
of
the
ridges
during
the
forenoon
we
traveled
up
a
branch
of
the
creek
on
which
we
had
encamped
in
a
broken
country
where
however
the
dividing
ridges
always
afforded
a
good
road
plants
were
few
and
with
the
short
sward
of
the
which
now
prevailed
everywhere
giving
to
the
prairies
a
smooth
and
mossy
appearance
were
mingled
frequent
patches
of
a
beautiful
red
grass
which
had
made
its
appearance
only
within
the
last
few
days
we
halted
to
noon
at
a
solitary
cottonwood
in
a
hollow
near
which
was
killed
the
first
buffalo
a
large
old
bull
antelope
appeared
in
bands
during
the
day
crossing
here
to
the
affluents
of
the
republican
we
encamped
on
a
fork
about
forty
feet
wide
and
one
foot
deep
flowing
with
a
swift
current
over
a
sandy
bed
and
well
wooded
with
maple
elm
cottonwood
and
a
few
white
oaks
we
were
visited
in
the
evening
by
a
very
violent
storm
accompanied
by
wind
lightning
and
thunder
a
cold
rain
falling
in
torrents
according
to
the
barometer
our
elevation
was
feet
above
the
gulf
at
noon
on
the
we
descended
into
the
valley
of
a
principal
fork
of
the
republican
a
beautiful
stream
with
a
dense
border
of
wood
consisting
principally
of
varieties
of
ash
forty
feet
wide
and
four
deep
it
was
musical
with
the
notes
of
many
birds
which
from
the
vast
expanse
of
silent
prairie
around
seemed
all
to
have
collected
here
we
continued
during
the
afternoon
our
route
along
the
river
which
was
populous
with
prairie
dogs
the
bottoms
being
entirely
occupied
with
their
villages
and
late
in
the
evening
encamped
on
its
banks
the
prevailing
timber
is
a
ash
near
and
maple
with
these
were
cottonwood
and
willow
we
gave
to
this
stream
the
name
of
prairie
dog
river
elevation
feet
our
road
on
the
lay
over
high
smooth
ridges
feet
above
the
sea
buffalo
in
great
numbers
absolutely
covering
the
face
of
the
country
at
evening
we
encamped
within
a
few
miles
of
the
main
republican
on
a
little
creek
where
the
air
was
fragrant
with
the
perfume
of
which
we
here
saw
for
the
first
time
and
which
was
now
in
bloom
shortly
after
leaving
our
encampment
on
the
we
found
suddenly
that
the
nature
of
the
country
had
entirely
changed
bare
everywhere
surrounded
us
in
the
undulating
ground
along
which
we
were
moving
and
the
plants
peculiar
to
a
sandy
soil
made
their
appearance
in
abundance
a
few
miles
further
we
entered
the
valley
of
a
large
stream
afterwards
known
to
be
the
republican
fork
of
the
kansas
whose
shallow
waters
with
a
depth
of
only
a
few
inches
were
spread
out
over
a
bed
of
yellowish
white
sand
yards
wide
with
the
exception
of
one
or
two
distant
and
detached
groves
no
timber
of
any
kind
was
to
be
seen
and
the
features
of
the
country
assumed
a
desert
character
with
which
the
broad
river
struggling
for
existence
among
the
quicksands
along
the
treeless
banks
was
strikingly
in
keeping
on
the
opposite
side
the
broken
ridges
assumed
almost
a
mountainous
appearance
and
fording
the
stream
we
continued
on
our
course
among
these
ridges
and
encamped
late
in
the
evening
at
a
little
pond
of
very
bad
water
from
which
we
drove
away
a
herd
of
buffalo
that
were
standing
in
and
about
it
our
encampment
this
evening
was
feet
above
the
sea
we
traveled
now
for
several
days
through
a
broken
and
dry
sandy
region
about
feet
above
the
sea
where
there
were
no
running
streams
and
some
anxiety
was
constantly
felt
on
account
of
the
uncertainty
of
water
which
was
only
to
be
found
in
small
lakes
that
occurred
occasionally
among
the
hills
the
discovery
of
these
always
brought
pleasure
to
the
camp
as
around
them
were
generally
green
flats
which
afforded
abundant
pasturage
for
our
animals
and
here
we
usually
collected
herds
of
the
buffalo
which
now
were
scattered
over
all
the
country
in
countless
numbers
the
soil
of
bare
and
hot
sands
supported
a
varied
and
exuberant
growth
of
plants
which
were
much
farther
advanced
than
we
had
previously
found
them
and
whose
showy
bloom
somewhat
relieved
the
appearance
of
general
sterility
crossing
the
summit
of
an
elevated
and
continuous
range
of
rolling
hills
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
june
we
found
ourselves
overlooking
a
broad
and
misty
valley
where
about
ten
miles
distant
and
feet
below
us
the
south
fork
of
the
platte
was
rolling
magnificently
along
swollen
with
the
waters
of
the
melting
snows
it
was
in
strong
and
refreshing
contrast
with
the
parched
country
from
which
we
had
just
issued
and
when
at
night
the
broad
expanse
of
water
grew
indistinct
it
almost
seemed
that
we
had
pitched
our
tents
on
the
shore
of
the
sea
july
traveling
along
up
the
valley
of
the
river
here
feet
above
the
sea
in
the
afternoon
of
july
we
caught
a
far
and
uncertain
view
of
a
faint
blue
mass
in
the
west
as
the
sun
sank
behind
it
and
from
our
camp
in
the
morning
at
the
mouth
of
bijou
long
peak
and
the
neighboring
mountains
stood
out
into
the
sky
grand
and
luminously
white
covered
to
their
bases
with
glittering
snow
on
the
evening
of
the
as
we
were
journeying
along
the
partially
overflowed
bottoms
of
the
platte
where
our
passage
stirred
up
swarms
of
musquitoes
we
came
unexpectedly
on
an
indian
who
was
perched
upon
a
bluff
curiously
watching
the
movements
of
our
caravan
he
belonged
to
a
village
of
oglallah
sioux
who
had
lost
all
their
animals
in
the
severity
of
the
preceding
winter
and
were
now
on
their
way
up
the
bijou
fork
to
beg
horses
from
the
arapahoes
who
were
hunting
buffalo
at
the
head
of
that
river
several
came
into
our
camp
at
noon
and
as
they
were
hungry
as
usual
they
were
provided
with
of
which
the
hunters
had
brought
in
an
abundant
supply
about
noon
on
the
of
july
we
arrived
at
the
fort
where
vrain
received
us
with
his
customary
kindness
and
invited
us
to
join
him
in
a
feast
which
had
been
prepared
in
honor
of
the
day
our
animals
were
very
much
worn
out
and
our
stock
of
provisions
entirely
exhausted
when
we
arrived
at
the
fort
but
i
was
disappointed
in
my
hope
of
obtaining
relief
as
i
found
it
in
a
very
impoverished
condition
and
we
were
able
to
procure
only
a
little
unbolted
mexican
flour
and
some
salt
with
a
few
pounds
of
powder
and
lead
as
regarded
provisions
it
did
not
much
matter
in
a
country
where
rarely
the
day
passed
without
seeing
some
kind
of
game
and
where
it
was
frequently
abundant
it
was
a
rare
thing
to
lie
down
hungry
and
we
had
already
learned
to
think
bread
a
luxury
but
we
could
not
proceed
without
animals
and
our
own
were
not
capable
of
prosecuting
the
journey
beyond
the
mountains
without
relief
i
had
been
informed
that
a
large
number
of
mules
had
recently
arrived
at
taos
from
upper
california
and
as
our
friend
maxwell
was
about
to
continue
his
journey
to
that
place
where
a
portion
of
his
family
resided
i
engaged
him
to
purchase
for
me
ten
or
twelve
mules
with
the
understanding
that
he
should
pack
them
with
provisions
and
other
necessaries
and
meet
me
at
the
mouth
of
the
on
the
arkansas
river
to
which
point
i
would
be
led
in
the
course
of
the
survey
agreeably
to
his
own
request
and
in
the
conviction
that
his
habits
of
life
and
education
had
not
qualified
him
to
endure
the
hard
life
of
a
voyageur
i
discharged
here
one
of
my
party
oscar
sarpy
having
furnished
him
with
arms
and
means
of
transportation
to
fort
laramie
where
he
would
be
in
the
line
of
caravans
returning
to
the
states
at
daybreak
on
the
of
july
maxwell
was
on
his
way
to
taos
and
a
few
hours
after
we
also
had
recommenced
our
journey
up
the
platte
which
was
continuously
timbered
with
cottonwood
and
willow
on
a
generally
sandy
soil
passing
on
the
way
the
remains
of
two
abandoned
forts
one
of
which
however
was
still
in
good
condition
we
reached
in
ten
miles
fort
lancaster
the
trading
establishment
of
lupton
his
post
was
beginning
to
assume
the
appearance
of
a
comfortable
farm
stock
hogs
and
cattle
were
ranging
about
on
the
prairie
there
were
different
kinds
of
poultry
and
there
was
a
wreck
of
a
promising
garden
in
which
a
considerable
variety
of
vegetables
had
been
in
a
flourishing
condition
but
it
had
been
almost
entirely
ruined
by
the
recent
high
waters
i
remained
to
spend
with
him
an
agreeable
hour
and
set
off
in
a
cold
storm
of
rain
which
was
accompanied
with
violent
thunder
and
lightning
we
encamped
immediately
on
the
river
sixteen
miles
from
vrain
several
arapahoes
on
their
way
to
the
village
which
was
encamped
a
few
miles
above
us
passed
by
the
camp
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
night
set
in
stormy
and
cold
with
heavy
and
continuous
rain
which
lasted
until
morning
we
made
this
morning
an
early
start
continuing
to
travel
up
the
platte
and
in
a
few
miles
frequent
bands
of
horses
and
mules
scattered
for
several
miles
round
about
indicated
our
approach
to
the
arapaho
village
which
we
found
encamped
in
a
beautiful
bottom
and
consisting
of
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
lodges
it
appeared
extremely
populous
with
a
great
number
of
children
a
circumstance
which
indicated
a
regular
supply
of
the
means
of
subsistence
the
chiefs
who
were
gathered
together
at
the
farther
end
of
the
village
received
us
as
probably
strangers
are
always
received
to
whom
they
desire
to
show
respect
or
regard
by
throwing
their
arms
around
our
necks
and
embracing
us
it
required
some
skill
in
horsemanship
to
keep
the
saddle
during
the
performance
of
this
ceremony
as
our
american
horses
exhibited
for
them
the
same
fear
they
have
for
a
bear
or
any
other
wild
animal
having
very
few
goods
with
me
i
was
only
able
to
make
them
a
meager
present
accounting
for
the
poverty
of
the
gift
by
explaining
that
my
goods
had
been
left
with
the
wagons
in
charge
of
fitzpatrick
who
was
well
known
to
them
as
the
white
head
or
the
broken
hand
i
saw
here
as
i
had
remarked
in
an
arapaho
village
the
preceding
year
near
the
lodges
of
the
chiefs
tall
tripods
of
white
poles
supporting
their
spears
and
shields
which
showed
it
to
be
a
regular
custom
though
disappointed
in
obtaining
the
presents
which
had
been
evidently
expected
they
behaved
very
courteously
and
after
a
little
conversation
i
left
them
and
continuing
on
up
the
river
halted
to
noon
on
the
bluff
as
the
bottoms
are
almost
inundated
continuing
in
the
afternoon
our
route
along
the
mountains
which
were
dark
misty
and
shrouded
threatening
a
storm
the
snow
peaks
sometimes
glittering
through
the
clouds
beyond
the
first
ridge
we
surprised
a
grizzly
bear
sauntering
along
the
river
which
raising
himself
upon
his
hind
legs
took
a
deliberate
survey
of
us
that
did
not
appear
very
satisfactory
to
him
and
he
scrambled
into
the
river
and
swam
to
the
opposite
side
we
halted
for
the
night
a
little
above
cherry
creek
the
evening
cloudy
with
many
musquitoes
some
indifferent
observations
placed
the
camp
in
lat
and
chronometric
long
we
continued
to
travel
up
the
platte
the
morning
pleasant
with
a
prospect
of
fairer
weather
during
the
forenoon
our
way
lay
over
a
more
broken
country
with
a
gravelly
and
sandy
surface
although
the
immediate
bottom
of
the
river
was
a
good
soil
of
a
dark
and
sandy
mould
resting
upon
a
stratum
of
large
pebbles
or
rolled
stones
as
at
laramie
fork
on
our
right
and
apparently
very
near
but
probably
or
miles
distant
and
two
or
three
thousand
feet
above
us
ran
the
first
range
of
the
mountains
like
a
dark
corniced
line
in
clear
contrast
with
the
great
snowy
chain
which
immediately
beyond
rose
glittering
five
thousand
feet
above
them
we
caught
this
morning
a
view
of
pike
peak
but
it
appeared
for
a
moment
only
as
clouds
rose
early
over
the
mountains
and
shrouded
them
in
mist
and
rain
all
the
day
in
the
first
range
were
visible
as
at
the
red
buttes
on
the
north
fork
very
lofty
escarpments
of
red
rock
while
traveling
through
this
region
i
remarked
that
always
in
the
morning
the
lofty
peaks
were
visible
and
bright
but
very
soon
small
white
clouds
began
to
settle
around
them
brewing
thicker
and
thicker
as
the
day
advanced
until
the
afternoon
when
the
thunder
began
to
roll
and
invariably
at
evening
we
had
more
or
less
of
a
thunder
storm
at
and
miles
from
vrain
fort
we
reached
a
point
in
this
southern
fork
of
the
platte
where
the
stream
is
divided
into
three
forks
two
of
these
one
of
them
being
much
the
largest
issuing
directly
from
the
mountains
on
the
west
and
forming
with
the
branch
a
river
of
the
plains
the
elevation
of
this
point
is
about
feet
above
the
sea
this
river
falling
feet
in
a
distance
of
miles
to
its
junction
with
the
north
fork
of
the
platte
in
this
estimate
the
elevation
of
the
junction
is
assumed
as
given
by
our
barometrical
observations
in
on
the
easternmost
branch
up
which
we
took
our
way
we
first
came
among
the
pines
growing
on
the
top
of
a
very
high
bank
and
where
we
halted
on
it
to
noon
quaking
asp
was
mixed
with
the
cottonwood
and
there
were
excellent
grass
and
rushes
for
the
animals
during
the
morning
there
occurred
many
beautiful
flowers
which
we
had
not
hitherto
met
among
them
the
common
blue
flowering
flax
made
its
first
appearance
and
a
tall
and
handsome
species
of
with
slender
scarlet
flowers
which
appeared
yesterday
for
the
first
time
was
very
frequent
we
had
found
very
little
game
since
leaving
the
fort
and
provisions
began
to
get
unpleasantly
scant
as
we
had
had
no
meat
for
several
days
but
towards
sundown
when
we
had
already
made
up
our
minds
to
sleep
another
night
without
supper
lajeunesse
had
the
good
fortune
to
kill
a
fine
deer
which
he
found
feeding
in
a
hollow
near
by
and
as
the
rain
began
to
fall
threatening
an
unpleasant
night
we
hurried
to
secure
a
comfortable
camp
in
the
timber
the
camp
fires
girdled
with
of
fine
venison
looked
cheerful
in
spite
of
the
stormy
weather
on
account
of
the
low
state
of
our
provisions
and
the
scarcity
of
game
i
determined
to
vary
our
route
and
proceed
several
camps
to
the
eastward
in
the
hope
of
falling
in
with
the
buffalo
this
route
along
the
dividing
grounds
between
the
south
fork
of
the
platte
and
the
arkansas
would
also
afford
some
additional
geographical
information
this
morning
therefore
we
turned
to
the
eastward
along
the
upper
waters
of
the
stream
on
which
we
had
encamped
entering
a
country
of
picturesque
and
varied
scenery
broken
into
rocky
hills
of
singular
shapes
little
valleys
with
pure
crystal
water
here
leaping
swiftly
along
and
there
losing
itself
in
the
sands
green
spots
of
luxuriant
grass
flowers
of
all
colors
and
timber
of
different
kinds
every
thing
to
give
it
a
varied
beauty
except
game
to
one
of
these
remarkably
shaped
hills
having
on
the
summit
a
circular
flat
rock
two
or
three
hundred
yards
in
circumference
some
one
gave
the
name
of
poundcake
which
it
has
been
permitted
to
retain
as
our
hungry
people
seemed
to
think
it
a
very
agreeable
comparison
in
the
afternoon
a
buffalo
bull
was
killed
and
we
encamped
on
a
small
stream
near
the
road
which
runs
from
vrain
fort
to
the
arkansas
snow
fell
heavily
on
the
mountains
during
the
night
and
peak
this
morning
is
luminous
and
grand
covered
from
the
summit
as
low
down
as
we
can
see
with
glittering
white
leaving
the
encampment
at
we
continued
our
easterly
course
over
a
rolling
country
near
to
the
high
ridges
which
are
generally
rough
and
rocky
with
a
coarse
conglomerate
displayed
in
masses
and
covered
with
pines
the
rock
is
very
friable
and
it
is
undoubtedly
from
its
decomposition
that
the
prairies
derive
their
sandy
and
gravelly
formation
in
six
miles
we
crossed
a
of
the
kioway
river
on
which
we
found
a
strong
fort
and
that
had
been
built
in
the
spring
and
halted
to
noon
on
the
principal
branch
of
the
river
during
the
morning
our
route
led
over
a
dark
and
vegetable
mould
mixed
with
sand
and
gravel
the
characteristic
plant
being
a
species
of
clover
which
is
much
used
in
certain
parts
of
germany
for
pasturage
of
stock
principally
hogs
it
is
sown
on
rocky
waste
ground
which
would
otherwise
be
useless
and
grows
very
luxuriantly
requiring
only
a
renewal
of
the
seed
about
once
in
fifteen
years
its
abundance
here
greatly
adds
to
the
pastoral
value
of
this
region
a
species
of
antennaria
in
flower
was
very
common
along
the
line
of
road
and
the
creeks
were
timbered
with
willow
and
pine
we
encamped
on
bijou
fork
the
water
of
which
unlike
the
clear
streams
we
had
previously
crossed
is
of
a
whitish
color
and
the
soil
of
the
bottom
a
very
hard
tough
clay
there
was
a
prairie
dog
village
on
the
bottom
and
in
the
endeavor
to
unearth
one
of
the
little
animals
we
labored
ineffectually
in
the
tough
clay
until
dark
after
descending
with
a
slight
inclination
until
it
had
gone
the
depth
of
two
feet
the
hole
suddenly
turned
at
a
sharp
angle
in
another
direction
for
one
more
foot
in
depth
when
it
again
turned
taking
an
ascending
direction
to
the
next
nearest
hole
i
have
no
doubt
that
all
their
little
habitations
communicate
with
each
other
the
greater
part
of
the
people
were
sick
and
i
was
inclined
to
attribute
their
indisposition
to
the
meat
of
the
bull
which
had
been
killed
the
previous
day
there
were
no
indications
of
buffalo
having
been
recently
in
the
neighborhood
and
unwilling
to
travel
farther
eastward
i
turned
this
morning
to
the
southward
up
the
valley
of
bijou
occurred
universally
and
among
the
plants
on
the
river
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
during
this
journey
a
few
small
bushes
of
the
of
the
voyageurs
which
is
commonly
used
for
firewood
yesterday
and
the
road
has
been
ornamented
with
the
showy
bloom
of
a
beautiful
lupinus
a
characteristic
in
many
parts
of
the
mountain
region
on
which
were
generally
great
numbers
of
an
insect
with
very
bright
colors
as
we
were
riding
quietly
along
eagerly
searching
every
hollow
in
search
of
game
we
discovered
at
a
little
distance
in
the
prairie
a
large
grizzly
bear
so
busily
engaged
in
digging
roots
that
he
did
not
perceive
us
until
we
were
galloping
down
a
little
hill
fifty
yards
from
him
when
he
charged
upon
us
with
such
sudden
energy
that
several
of
us
came
near
losing
our
saddles
being
wounded
he
commenced
retreating
to
a
rocky
piny
ridge
near
by
from
which
we
were
not
able
to
cut
him
off
and
we
entered
the
timber
with
him
the
way
was
very
much
blocked
up
with
fallen
timber
and
we
kept
up
a
running
fight
for
some
time
animated
by
the
bear
charging
among
the
horses
he
did
not
fall
until
after
he
had
received
six
rifle
balls
he
was
miserably
poor
and
added
nothing
to
our
stock
of
provisions
we
followed
the
stream
to
its
head
in
a
broken
ridge
which
according
to
the
barometer
was
about
feet
above
the
sea
this
is
a
piny
elevation
into
which
the
prairies
are
gathered
and
from
which
the
waters
flow
in
almost
every
direction
to
the
arkansas
platte
and
kansas
rivers
the
latter
stream
having
here
its
remotest
sources
although
somewhat
rocky
and
broken
and
covered
with
pines
in
comparison
with
the
neighboring
mountains
it
scarcely
forms
an
interruption
to
the
great
prairie
plains
which
sweep
up
to
their
bases
we
had
an
excellent
view
of
pike
peak
from
this
camp
at
the
distance
of
forty
miles
this
mountain
barrier
presents
itself
to
travelers
on
the
plains
which
sweep
almost
directly
to
its
bases
an
immense
and
comparatively
smooth
and
grassy
prairie
in
very
strong
contrast
with
the
black
masses
of
timber
and
the
glittering
snow
above
them
with
occasional
exceptions
comparatively
so
very
small
as
not
to
require
mention
these
prairies
are
everywhere
covered
with
a
close
and
vigorous
growth
of
a
great
variety
of
grasses
among
which
the
most
abundant
is
the
buffalo
grass
between
the
platte
and
arkansas
rivers
that
part
of
this
region
which
forms
the
basin
drained
by
the
waters
of
the
kansas
with
which
our
operations
made
us
more
particularly
acquainted
is
based
upon
a
formation
of
calcareous
rocks
the
soil
of
all
this
country
is
excellent
admirably
adapted
to
agricultural
purposes
and
would
support
a
large
agricultural
and
pastoral
population
a
glance
at
the
map
along
our
several
lines
of
travel
will
show
you
that
this
plain
is
watered
by
many
streams
throughout
the
western
half
of
the
plain
these
are
shallow
with
sandy
beds
becoming
deeper
as
they
reach
the
richer
lands
approaching
the
missouri
river
they
generally
have
bottom
lands
bordered
by
bluffs
varying
from
fifty
to
five
hundred
feet
in
height
in
all
this
region
the
timber
is
entirely
confined
to
the
streams
in
the
eastern
half
where
the
soil
is
a
deep
rich
vegetable
mould
retentive
of
rain
and
moisture
it
is
of
vigorous
growth
and
of
many
different
kinds
and
throughout
the
western
half
it
consists
entirely
of
various
species
of
cottonwood
which
deserves
to
be
called
the
tree
of
the
desert
growing
in
sandy
soils
where
no
other
tree
will
grow
pointing
out
the
existence
of
water
and
furnishing
to
the
traveler
fuel
and
food
for
his
animals
add
to
this
that
the
western
border
of
the
plain
is
occupied
by
the
sioux
arapaho
and
cheyenne
nations
with
the
pawnees
and
other
tribes
in
its
eastern
limits
for
whom
the
intermediate
country
is
a
and
you
will
have
a
tolerably
correct
idea
of
the
appearance
and
condition
of
the
country
descending
a
somewhat
precipitous
and
rocky
hillside
among
the
pines
which
rarely
appear
elsewhere
than
on
the
ridge
we
encamped
at
its
foot
where
there
were
several
springs
which
you
will
find
laid
down
upon
the
map
as
one
of
the
extreme
sources
of
the
smoky
hill
fork
of
the
kansas
from
this
place
the
view
extended
over
the
arkansas
valley
and
the
spanish
peaks
in
the
south
beyond
as
the
greater
part
of
the
men
continued
sick
i
encamped
here
for
the
day
and
ascertained
conclusively
from
experiments
on
myself
that
their
illness
was
caused
by
the
meat
of
the
buffalo
bull
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
near
the
camp
were
several
forts
which
in
front
were
very
difficult
of
approach
and
in
the
rear
were
protected
by
a
precipice
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
a
the
evening
was
tolerably
clear
with
a
temperature
at
sunset
of
elevation
of
the
camp
seven
thousand
and
three
hundred
feet
turning
the
next
day
to
the
southwest
we
reached
in
the
course
of
the
morning
the
to
the
settlements
on
the
arkansas
river
and
encamped
in
the
afternoon
on
the
or
boiling
spring
river
where
it
was
fifty
feet
wide
with
a
swift
current
i
afterwards
found
that
the
spring
and
river
owe
their
names
to
the
bubbling
of
the
effervescing
gas
in
the
former
and
not
to
the
temperature
of
the
water
which
is
cold
during
the
morning
a
tall
species
of
with
a
slender
white
flower
was
characteristic
and
in
the
latter
part
of
the
day
another
variety
of
wild
clover
having
the
flower
white
was
equally
so
we
had
a
fine
sunset
of
golden
brown
and
in
the
evening
a
very
bright
moon
with
the
near
mountains
made
a
beautiful
scene
thermometer
at
sunset
was
and
our
elevation
above
the
sea
feet
the
morning
was
clear
with
a
northwesterly
breeze
and
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
at
there
were
no
clouds
along
the
mountains
and
the
morning
sun
showed
very
clearly
their
rugged
character
we
resumed
our
journey
very
early
down
the
river
following
an
extremely
good
which
issues
by
the
head
of
this
stream
from
the
bayou
salade
a
high
mountain
valley
behind
pike
peak
the
soil
along
the
road
was
sandy
and
gravelly
and
the
river
well
timbered
we
halted
to
noon
under
the
shade
of
some
fine
large
cottonwoods
our
animals
luxuriating
on
rushes
which
along
this
river
were
remarkably
abundant
a
variety
of
cactus
made
its
appearance
and
among
several
strange
plants
were
numerous
and
beautiful
clusters
of
a
plant
resembling
with
a
handsome
convolvulus
i
had
not
hitherto
seen
in
the
afternoon
we
passed
near
the
encampment
of
a
hunter
named
maurice
who
had
been
out
into
the
plains
in
pursuit
of
buffalo
calves
a
number
of
which
i
saw
among
some
domestic
cattle
near
his
lodge
shortly
afterwards
a
party
of
mountaineers
galloped
up
to
us
and
hardy
men
dressed
in
skins
and
mounted
on
good
fat
horses
among
them
were
several
connecticut
men
a
portion
of
wyeth
party
whom
i
had
seen
the
year
before
and
others
were
men
from
the
western
states
continuing
down
the
river
we
encamped
at
noon
on
the
at
its
mouth
on
the
arkansas
river
a
short
distance
above
our
encampment
on
the
left
bank
of
the
arkansas
is
a
as
the
mexicans
call
their
civilized
indian
villages
where
a
number
of
mountaineers
who
had
married
spanish
women
in
the
valley
of
taos
had
collected
together
and
occupied
themselves
in
farming
carrying
on
at
the
same
time
a
desultory
indian
trade
they
were
principally
americans
and
treated
us
with
all
the
rude
hospitality
their
situation
admitted
but
as
all
commercial
intercourse
with
new
mexico
was
now
interrupted
in
consequence
of
mexican
decrees
to
that
effect
there
was
nothing
to
be
had
in
the
way
of
provisions
they
had
however
a
fine
stock
of
cattle
and
furnished
us
an
abundance
of
excellent
milk
i
learned
here
that
maxwell
in
company
with
two
other
men
had
started
for
taos
on
the
morning
of
the
but
that
he
would
probably
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
utah
indians
commonly
called
the
as
maxwell
had
no
knowledge
of
their
being
in
the
vicinity
when
he
crossed
the
arkansas
his
chance
of
escape
was
very
doubtful
but
i
did
not
entertain
much
apprehension
for
his
life
having
great
confidence
in
his
prudence
and
courage
i
was
further
informed
that
there
had
been
a
popular
tumult
among
the
or
civilized
indians
residing
near
taos
against
the
of
that
place
in
which
they
had
plundered
their
houses
and
their
families
among
those
whose
property
had
been
destroyed
was
beaubien
of
maxwell
from
whom
i
had
expected
to
obtain
supplies
and
who
had
been
obliged
to
make
his
escape
to
santa
fé
by
this
position
of
affairs
our
expectation
of
obtaining
supplies
from
taos
was
cut
off
i
had
here
the
satisfaction
to
meet
our
good
of
christopher
carson
whose
services
i
considered
myself
fortunate
to
secure
again
and
as
a
reinforcement
of
mules
was
absolutely
necessary
i
dispatched
him
immediately
with
an
account
of
our
necessities
to
charles
bent
whose
principal
post
is
on
the
arkansas
river
about
miles
below
he
was
directed
to
proceed
from
that
post
by
the
nearest
route
across
the
country
and
meet
me
with
what
animals
he
should
be
able
to
obtain
at
vrain
fort
i
also
admitted
into
the
party
charles
towns
a
native
of
louis
a
serviceable
man
with
many
of
the
qualities
of
a
good
voyageur
according
to
our
observations
the
latitude
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
is
its
longitude
and
its
elevation
above
the
sea
feet
on
the
morning
of
the
the
time
for
maxwell
arrival
having
expired
we
resumed
our
journey
leaving
for
him
a
note
in
which
it
was
stated
that
i
would
wait
for
him
at
vrain
fort
until
the
morning
of
the
in
the
event
that
he
should
succeed
in
his
commission
our
direction
was
up
the
boiling
spring
river
it
being
my
intention
to
visit
the
celebrated
springs
from
which
the
river
takes
its
name
and
which
are
on
its
upper
waters
at
the
foot
of
peak
our
animals
fared
well
while
we
were
on
this
stream
there
being
everywhere
a
great
abundance
of
in
bloom
was
a
characteristic
plant
along
the
river
generally
in
large
bunches
with
two
to
five
flowers
on
each
beautiful
clusters
of
the
plant
resembling
were
numerous
and
was
a
characteristic
of
the
bottoms
currants
nearly
ripe
were
abundant
and
among
the
shrubs
which
covered
the
bottom
was
a
very
luxuriant
growth
of
chenopodiaceous
shrubs
four
to
six
feet
high
on
the
afternoon
of
the
we
entered
among
the
broken
ridges
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
where
the
river
made
several
forks
leaving
the
camp
to
follow
slowly
i
rode
ahead
in
the
afternoon
in
search
of
the
springs
in
the
meantime
the
clouds
which
had
been
gathered
all
the
afternoon
over
the
mountains
began
to
roll
down
their
sides
and
a
storm
so
violent
burst
upon
me
that
it
appeared
i
had
entered
the
storehouse
of
the
i
continued
however
to
ride
along
up
the
river
until
about
sunset
and
was
beginning
to
be
doubtful
of
finding
the
springs
before
the
next
day
when
i
came
suddenly
upon
a
large
smooth
rock
about
twenty
yards
in
diameter
where
the
water
from
several
springs
was
bubbling
and
boiling
up
in
the
midst
of
a
white
incrustation
with
which
it
had
covered
a
portion
of
the
rock
as
this
did
not
correspond
with
the
description
given
the
by
the
hunters
i
did
not
stop
to
taste
the
water
but
dismounting
walked
a
little
way
up
the
river
and
passing
through
a
narrow
thicket
of
shrubbery
bordering
the
stream
stepped
directly
upon
a
huge
white
rock
at
the
foot
of
which
the
river
already
become
a
torrent
foamed
along
broken
by
a
small
fall
a
deer
which
had
been
drinking
at
the
spring
was
startled
by
my
approach
and
springing
across
the
river
bounded
off
up
the
mountain
in
the
upper
part
of
the
rock
which
had
apparently
been
formed
by
deposition
was
a
beautiful
white
basin
overhung
by
currant
bushes
in
which
the
cold
clear
water
bubbled
up
kept
in
constant
motion
by
the
escaping
gas
and
overflowing
the
rock
which
it
had
almost
entirely
covered
with
a
smooth
crust
of
glistening
white
i
had
all
day
refrained
from
drinking
reserving
myself
for
the
spring
and
as
i
could
not
well
be
more
wet
than
the
rain
had
already
made
me
i
lay
down
by
the
side
of
the
basin
and
drank
heartily
of
the
delightful
water
the
spring
is
situated
immediately
at
the
foot
of
lofty
mountains
beautifully
timbered
which
sweep
closely
round
shutting
up
the
little
valley
in
a
kind
of
cove
as
it
was
beginning
to
grow
dark
i
rode
quickly
down
the
river
on
which
i
found
the
camp
a
few
miles
below
the
morning
of
the
was
beautiful
and
clear
and
all
the
people
being
anxious
to
drink
of
these
famous
waters
we
encamped
immediately
at
the
springs
and
spent
there
a
very
pleasant
day
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
is
another
locality
of
springs
which
are
entirely
of
same
nature
the
water
has
a
very
agreeable
taste
which
preuss
found
very
much
to
resemble
that
of
the
famous
selter
springs
in
the
grand
duchy
of
nassau
a
country
famous
for
wine
and
mineral
waters
and
it
is
almost
entirely
of
the
same
character
though
still
more
agreeable
than
that
of
the
famous
bear
springs
near
bear
river
of
the
great
salt
lake
the
following

our
observations
this
place
is
feet
above
the

in
latitude
and
longitude
resuming
our
journey
on
this
morning
we
descended
the
river
in
order
to
reach
the
mouth
of
the
eastern
fork
which
i
proposed
to
ascend
the
left
bank
of
the
river
here
is
very
much
broken
there
is
a
handsome
little
bottom
on
the
right
and
both
banks
are
exceedingly
picturesque
strata
of
red
rock
in
nearly
perpendicular
walls
crossing
the
valley
from
north
to
south
about
three
miles
below
the
springs
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
is
a
nearly
perpendicular
limestone
rock
presenting
a
uniformly
unbroken
surface
twenty
to
forty
feet
high
containing
very
great
numbers
of
a
large
univalve
shell
which
appears
to
belong
to
the
genus
in
contact
with
this
to
the
westward
was
another
stratum
of
limestone
containing
fossil
shells
of
a
different
character
and
still
higher
up
on
the
stream
were
parallel
strata
consisting
of
a
compact
somewhat
crystalline
limestone
and
argillaceous
bituminous
limestone
in
thin
layers
during
the
morning
we
traveled
up
the
eastern
fork
of
the
river
our
road
being
roughened
by
frequent
deep
gullies
timbered
with
pine
and
halted
to
noon
on
a
small
branch
of
the
stream
timbered
principally
with
the
cottonwood
called
by
the
canadians
on
a
hill
near
by
were
two
remarkable
columns
of
a
conglomerate
rock
one
of
which
was
about
twenty
feet
high
and
two
feet
in
diameter
they
are
surmounted
by
slabs
of
a
dark
ferruginous
conglomerate
forming
black
caps
and
adding
very
much
to
their
columnar
effect
at
a
distance
this
rock
is
very
destructible
by
the
action
of
the
weather
and
the
hill
of
which
they
formerly
constituted
a
part
is
entirely
abraded
a
shaft
of
the
was
broken
in
the
afternoon
and
we
made
an
early
halt
the
stream
being
from
twelve
to
twenty
feet
wide
with
clear
water
as
usual
the
clouds
had
gathered
to
a
storm
over
the
mountains
and
we
had
a
showery
evening
at
sunset
the
thermometer
stood
at
and
our
elevation
above
the
sea
was
feet
this
morning
as
we
generally
found
the
mornings
under
these
mountains
was
very
clear
and
beautiful
and
the
air
cool
and
pleasant
with
the
thermometer
at
we
continued
our
march
up
the
stream
along
a
green
sloping
bottom
between
pine
hills
on
the
one
hand
and
the
main
black
hills
on
the
other
towards
the
ridge
which
separates
the
waters
of
the
platte
from
those
of
the
arkansas
as
we
approached
the
diving
ridge
the
whole
valley
was
radiant
with
flowers
blue
yellow
pink
white
scarlet
and
purple
vie
with
each
other
in
splendor
esparcette
was
one
of
the
highly
characteristic
plants
and
a
flower
was
very
frequent
but
the
most
abundant
plant
along
our
road
today
was
which
is
the
characteristic
plant
on
this
portion
of
the
diving
grounds
crossing
to
the
waters
of
the
platte
fields
of
blue
flax
added
to
the
magnificence
of
this
mountain
garden
this
was
occasionally
four
feet
in
height
which
was
a
luxuriance
of
growth
that
i
rarely
saw
this
almost
universal
plant
attain
throughout
the
journey
continuing
down
a
branch
of
the
platte
among
high
and
very
steep
timbered
hills
covered
with
fragments
of
sock
towards
evening
we
issued
from
the
piny
region
and
made
a
late
encampment
near
poundcake
rock
on
that
fork
of
the
river
which
we
had
ascended
on
the
of
july
our
animals
enjoyed
the
abundant
rushes
this
evening
as
the
flies
were
so
bad
among
the
pines
that
they
had
been
much
harassed
a
deer
was
killed
here
this
evening
and
again
the
evening
was
overcast
and
a
collection
of
brilliant
red
clouds
in
the
west
was
followed
by
the
customary
squall
of
rain
milfoil
was
among
the
characteristic
plants
of
the
river
bottoms
this
was
one
of
the
most
common
plants
during
the
whole
of
our
journey
occurring
in
almost
every
variety
of
situation
i
noticed
it
on
the
lowlands
of
the
rivers
near
the
coast
of
the
pacific
and
near
to
the
snow
among
the
mountains
of
the
during
this
excursion
we
had
surveyed
to
its
head
one
of
the
two
principal
branches
of
the
upper
arkansas
miles
in
length
and
entirely
completed
our
survey
of
the
south
fork
of
the
platte
to
the
extreme
sources
of
that
portion
of
the
river
which
belongs
to
the
plains
and
heads
in
the
broken
hills
of
the
arkansas
dividing
ridge
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
that
portion
of
its
waters
which
were
collected
among
these
mountains
it
was
hoped
to
explore
on
our
homeward
voyage
reaching
vrain
fort
on
the
morning
of
the
we
found
fitzpatrick
and
his
party
in
good
order
and
excellent
health
and
my
true
and
reliable
friend
kit
carson
who
had
brought
with
him
ten
good
mules
with
the
necessary
fitzpatrick
who
had
often
endured
every
extremity
of
want
during
the
course
of
his
mountain
life
and
knew
well
the
value
of
provisions
in
this
country
had
watched
over
our
stock
with
jealous
vigilance
and
there
was
an
abundance
of
flour
rice
sugar
and
coffee
in
the
camp
and
again
we
fared
luxuriously
meat
was
however
very
scarce
and
two
very
small
pigs
which
we
obtained
at
the
fort
did
not
go
far
among
forty
men
fitzpatrick
had
been
here
a
week
during
which
time
his
men
had
been
occupied
in
refitting
the
camp
and
the
repose
had
been
very
beneficial
to
his
animals
which
were
now
in
tolerably
good
condition
i
had
been
able
to
obtain
no
certain
information
in
regard
to
the
character
of
the
passes
in
this
portion
of
the
rocky
mountain
range
which
had
always
been
represented
as
impracticable
for
carriages
but
the
exploration
of
which
was
incidentally
contemplated
by
my
instructions
with
the
view
of
finding
some
convenient
point
of
passage
for
the
road
of
emigration
which
would
enable
it
to
reach
on
a
more
direct
line
the
usual
ford
of
the
great
colorado
a
place
considered
as
determined
by
the
nature
of
the
country
beyond
that
river
it
is
singular
that
immediately
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
i
could
find
no
one
sufficiently
acquainted
with
them
to
guide
us
to
the
plains
at
their
western
base
but
the
race
of
trappers
who
formerly
lived
in
their
recesses
has
almost
entirely
disappeared
dwindled
to
a
few
scattered
individuals
some
one
or
two
of
whom
are
regularly
killed
in
the
course
of
each
year
by
the
indians
you
will
remember
that
in
the
previous
year
i
brought
with
me
to
their
village
near
this
post
and
hospitably
treated
on
the
way
several
cheyenne
indians
whom
i
met
on
the
lower
platte
shortly
after
their
arrival
here
these
were
out
with
a
party
of
indians
themselves
the
principal
men
which
discovered
a
few
trappers
in
the
neighboring
mountains
whom
they
immediately
murdered
although
one
of
them
had
been
nearly
thirty
years
in
the
country
and
was
perfectly
well
known
as
he
had
grown
gray
among
them
through
this
portion
of
the
mountains
also
are
the
customary
roads
of
the
war
parties
going
out
against
the
utah
and
shoshonee
indians
and
occasionally
parties
from
the
crow
nation
make
their
way
down
to
the
southward
along
this
chain
in
the
expectation
of
surprising
some
straggling
lodges
of
their
enemies
shortly
before
our
arrival
one
of
their
parties
had
attacked
an
arapaho
village
in
the
vicinity
which
they
had
found
unexpectedly
strong
and
their
assault
was
turned
into
a
rapid
flight
and
a
hot
pursuit
in
which
they
had
been
compelled
to
abandon
the
animals
they
had
rode
and
escape
on
their
into
this
uncertain
and
dangerous
region
small
parties
of
three
or
four
trappers
who
now
could
collect
together
rarely
ventured
and
consequently
it
was
seldom
visited
and
little
known
having
determined
to
try
the
passage
by
a
pass
through
a
spur
of
the
mountains
made
by
the
river
which
rises
in
the
high
bed
of
mountains
around
long
peak
i
thought
it
advisable
to
avoid
any
encumbrance
which
would
occasion
detention
and
accordingly
again
separated
the
party
into
two
divisions
one
of
which
under
the
command
of
fitzpatrick
was
directed
to
cross
the
plains
to
the
mouth
of
laramie
river
and
continuing
thence
its
route
along
the
usual
emigrant
road
meet
me
at
fort
hall
a
post
belonging
to
the
hudson
bay
company
and
situated
on
snake
river
as
it
is
commonly
called
in
the
oregon
territory
although
better
known
to
us
as
lewis
fork
of
the
columbia
the
latter
name
is
there
restricted
to
one
of
the
upper
forks
of
the
river
our
delaware
indians
having
determined
to
return
to
their
homes
it
became
necessary
to
provide
this
party
with
a
good
hunter
and
i
accordingly
engaged
in
that
capacity
alexander
godey
a
young
man
about
years
of
age
who
had
been
in
this
country
six
or
seven
years
all
of
which
time
had
been
actively
employed
in
hunting
for
the
support
of
the
posts
or
in
solitary
trading
expeditions
among
the
indians
in
courage
and
professional
skill
he
was
a
formidable
rival
to
carson
and
constantly
afterwards
was
among
the
best
and
most
efficient
of
the
party
and
in
difficult
situations
was
of
incalculable
value
hiram
powers
one
of
the
men
belonging
to
fitzpatrick
party
was
discharged
at
this
place
a
french
at
lupton
fort
had
been
shot
in
the
back
on
the
of
july
and
died
during
our
absence
to
the
arkansas
the
wife
of
the
murdered
man
an
indian
woman
of
the
snake
nation
desirous
like
naomi
of
old
to
return
to
her
people
requested
and
obtained
permission
to
travel
with
my
party
to
the
neighborhood
of
bear
river
where
she
expected
to
meet
with
some
of
their
villages
happier
than
the
jewish
widow
she
carried
with
her
two
children
pretty
little
who
added
much
to
the
liveliness
of
the
camp
her
baggage
was
carried
on
five
or
six
and
i
gave
her
a
small
tent
for
which
i
no
longer
had
any
use
as
i
had
procured
a
lodge
at
the
fort
for
my
own
party
i
selected
the
following
men
a
number
of
whom
old
associations
had
rendered
agreeable
to
me

the
latitude
of
the
post
is
and
its
longitude
depending
with
all
the
other
longitudes
along
this
portion
of
the
line
upon
a
subsequent
occultation
of
september
to
which
they
are
referred
by
the
chronometer
its
distance
from
kansas
landing
by
the
road
we
traveled
which
it
will
be
remembered
was
very
winding
along
the
lower
kansas
river
was
miles
the
rate
of
the
chronometer
determined
by
observations
at
this
place
for
the
interval
of
our
absence
during
this
month
was
which
you
will
hereafter
see
did
not
sensibly
change
during
the
ensuing
month
and
remained
nearly
constant
during
the
remainder
of
our
journey
across
the
continent
this
was
the
rate
used
in
referring
to
vrain
fort
the
longitude
between
that
place
and
the
mouth
of
the
our
various
barometrical
observations
which
are
better
worthy
of
confidence
than
the
isolated
determination
of
give
for
the
elevation
of
the
fort
above
the
sea
feet
the
barometer
here
used
was
also
a
better
one
and
less
liable
to
derangement
at
the
end
of
two
days
which
was
allowed
to
my
animals
for
necessary
repose
all
the
arrangements
had
been
completed
and
on
the
afternoon
of
the
we
resumed
our
respective
routes
some
little
trouble
was
experienced
in
crossing
the
platte
the
waters
of
which
were
still
kept
up
by
rains
and
melting
snow
and
having
traveled
only
about
four
miles
we
encamped
in
the
evening
on
thompson
creek
where
we
were
very
much
disturbed
by
musquitoes
the
following
days
we
continued
our
march
westward
over
comparative
plains
and
fording
the
on
the
morning
of
the
entered
the
black
hills
and
nooned
on
this
stream
in
the
mountains
beyond
them
passing
over
a
fine
large
bottom
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
a
place
where
the
river
was
shut
up
in
the
hills
and
ascending
a
ravine
made
a
laborious
and
very
difficult
passage
around
by
a
gap
striking
the
river
again
about
dusk
a
little
labor
however
would
remove
this
difficulty
and
render
the
road
to
this
point
a
very
excellent
one
the
evening
closed
in
dark
with
rain
and
the
mountains
looked
gloomy
leaving
our
encampment
about
seven
in
the
morning
we
traveled
until
three
in
the
afternoon
along
the
river
which
for
the
distance
of
about
six
miles
runs
directly
through
a
spur
of
the
main
mountains
we
were
compelled
by
the
nature
of
the
ground
to
cross
the
river
eight
or
nine
times
at
difficult
deep
and
rocky
fords
the
stream
running
with
great
force
swollen
by
the
rains
a
true
mountain
torrent
only
forty
or
fifty
feet
wide
it
was
a
mountain
valley
of
the
narrowest
kind
almost
a
chasm
and
the
scenery
very
wild
and
beautiful
towering
mountains
rose
round
about
their
sides
sometimes
dark
with
forests
of
pine
and
sometimes
with
lofty
precipices
washed
by
the
river
while
below
as
if
they
indemnified
themselves
in
luxuriance
for
the
scanty
space
the
green
was
covered
with
a
wilderness
of
flowers
their
tall
spikes
sometimes
rising
above
our
heads
as
we
rode
among
them
a
profusion
of
blossoms
on
a
white
flowering
vine
which
was
abundant
along
the
river
contrasted
handsomely
with
the
green
foliage
of
the
trees
the
mountains
appeared
to
be
composed
of
a
and
red
granite
which
in
some
places
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
decomposition
making
a
red
soil
the
stream
was
wooded
with
cottonwood
and
cherry
with
currant
and
serviceberry
bushes
after
a
somewhat
laborious
day
during
which
it
had
rained
incessantly
we
encamped
near
the
end
of
the
pass
at
the
mouth
of
a
small
creek
in
sight
of
the
great
laramie
plains
it
continued
to
rain
heavily
and
at
evening
the
mountains
were
hid
in
mists
but
there
was
no
lack
of
wood
and
the
large
fires
we
made
to
dry
our
clothes
were
very
comfortable
and
at
night
the
hunters
came
in
with
a
fine
deer
rough
and
difficult
as
we
found
the
pass
an
excellent
road
may
be
made
with
a
little
labor
elevation
of
the
camp
feet
and
distance
from
vrain
fort
miles
the
day
was
bright
again
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
and
leaving
our
encampment
at
eight
in
about
half
a
mile
we
crossed
the
river
for
the
last
time
and
entering
a
smoother
country
we
traveled
along
a
kind
of
bounded
on
the
right
by
red
buttes
and
precipices
while
to
the
left
a
high
rolling
country
extended
to
a
range
of
the
black
hills
beyond
which
rose
the
great
mountains
around
long
peak
by
the
great
quantity
of
snow
visible
among
them
it
had
probably
snowed
heavily
there
the
previous
day
while
it
had
rained
on
us
in
the
valley
we
halted
at
noon
on
a
small
branch
and
in
the
afternoon
traveled
over
a
high
country
gradually
ascending
towards
a
range
of
or
high
hills
covered
with
pines
which
forms
the
dividing
ridge
between
the
waters
we
had
left
and
those
of
laramie
river
late
in
the
evening
we
encamped
at
a
spring
of
cold
water
near
the
summit
of
the
ridge
having
increased
our
elevation
to
feet
during
the
day
we
had
traveled
miles
by
some
indifferent
observations
our
latitude
is
a
species
of
was
characteristic
along
the
whole
day
route
emerging
from
the
mountains
we
entered
a
region
of
bright
fair
weather
in
my
experience
in
this
country
i
was
forcibly
impressed
with
the
different
character
of
the
climate
on
opposite
sides
of
the
rocky
mountain
range
the
vast
prairie
plain
on
the
east
is
like
the
ocean
the
rain
and
clouds
from
the
constantly
evaporating
snow
of
the
mountains
rushing
down
into
the
heated
air
of
the
plains
on
which
you
will
have
occasion
to
remark
the
frequent
storms
of
rain
we
encountered
during
our
journey
the
morning
was
clear
temperature
a
fine
rolling
road
among
piny
and
grassy
hills
brought
us
this
morning
into
a
large
trail
where
an
indian
village
had
recently
passed
the
weather
was
pleasant
and
cool
we
were
disturbed
by
neither
musquitoes
nor
flies
and
the
country
was
certainly
extremely
beautiful
the
slopes
and
broad
ravines
were
absolutely
covered
with
fields
of
flowers
of
the
most
exquisitely
beautiful
colors
among
those
which
had
not
hitherto
made
their
appearance
and
which
here
were
characteristic
was
a
new
of
a
green
and
lustrous
metallic
blue
color
mingled
with
compact
fields
of
several
varieties
of
which
were
crowded
together
in
splendid
profusion
this
trail
conducted
us
through
a
remarkable
defile
to
a
little
timbered
creek
up
which
we
wound
our
way
passing
by
a
singular
and
massive
wall
of
granite
the
formation
of
the
country
is
a
red
feldspathic
granite
overlaying
a
decomposing
mass
of
the
same
rock
forming
the
soil
of
all
this
region
which
everywhere
is
red
and
gravelly
and
appears
to
be
of
a
great
floral
fertility
as
we
emerged
on
a
small
tributary
of
the
laramie
river
coming
in
sight
of
its
principal
stream
the
flora
became
perfectly
magnificent
and
we
congratulated
ourselves
as
we
rode
along
our
pleasant
road
that
we
had
substituted
this
for
the
uninteresting
country
between
laramie
hills
and
the
sweet
water
valley
we
had
no
meat
for
supper
last
night
or
breakfast
this
morning
and
were
glad
to
see
carson
come
in
at
noon
with
a
good
antelope
a
meridian
observation
of
the
sun
placed
us
in
latitude
in
the
evening
we
encamped
on
the
laramie
river
which
is
here
very
thinly
timbered
with
scattered
groups
of
cottonwood
at
considerable
intervals
from
our
camp
we
are
able
to
distinguish
the
gorges
in
which
are
the
sources
of
and
laramie
rivers
and
the
medicine
bow
mountain
towards
the
point
of
which
we
are
directing
our
course
this
afternoon
has
been
in
sight
the
greater
part
of
the
day
by
observation
the
latitude
was
and
longitude
the
same
beautiful
flora
continued
till
about
four
in
the
afternoon
when
it
suddenly
disappeared
with
the
red
soil
which
became
sandy
and
of
a
color
the
evening
was
tolerably
clear
temperature
at
sunset
the
day
journey
was
miles
august
the
morning
was
calm
and
clear
with
sunrise
temperature
at
we
traveled
over
a
plain
or
open
rolling
country
at
the
foot
of
the
medicine
bow
mountain
the
soil
in
the
morning
being
sandy
with
fragments
of
rock
abundant
and
in
the
afternoon
when
we
approached
closer
to
the
mountain
so
stony
that
we
made
but
little
way
the
beautiful
plants
of
yesterday
reappeared
occasionally
flax
in
bloom
occurred
during
the
morning
and
esparcette
in
luxuriant
abundance
was
a
characteristic
of
the
stony
ground
in
the
afternoon
the
camp
was
roused
into
a
little
excitement
by
a
chase
after
a
buffalo
bull
and
an
encounter
with
a
war
party
of
sioux
and
cheyenne
indians
about
strong
hares
and
antelope
were
seen
during
the
day
and
one
of
the
latter
was
killed
the
laramie
peak
was
in
sight
this
afternoon
the
evening
was
clear
with
scattered
clouds
temperature
the
journey
was
miles
temperature
at
sunrise
and
scenery
and
weather
made
our
road
delightful
the
neighboring
mountain
is
thickly
studded
with
pines
intermingled
with
the
brighter
foliage
of
aspens
and
occasional
spots
like
lawns
between
the
patches
of
snow
among
the
pines
and
here
and
there
on
the
heights
our
route
below
lay
over
a
comparative
plain
covered
with
the
same
brilliant
vegetation
and
the
day
was
clear
and
pleasantly
cool
during
the
morning
we
crossed
many
streams
clear
and
rocky
and
broad
grassy
valleys
of
a
strong
black
soil
washed
down
from
the
mountains
and
producing
excellent
pasturage
these
were
timbered
with
the
red
willow
and
cottonwood
mingled
with
aspen
as
we
approached
the
mountain
more
nearly
towards
noon
was
a
characteristic
and
flax
occurred
frequently
in
bloom
we
halted
at
noon
on
the
most
western
fork
of
laramie
river
a
handsome
stream
about
sixty
feet
wide
and
two
feet
deep
with
clear
water
and
a
swift
current
over
a
bed
composed
entirely
of
boulders
or
there
was
a
large
open
bottom
here
on
which
were
many
lodge
poles
lying
about
and
in
the
edge
of
the
surrounding
timber
were
three
strong
forts
that
appeared
to
have
been
recently
occupied
at
this
place
i
became
first
acquainted
with
the
which
i
found
our
snake
woman
engaged
in
digging
in
the
low
timbered
bottom
of
the
creek
among
the
indians
along
the
rocky
mountains
and
more
particularly
among
the
shoshonee
or
snake
indians
in
whose
territory
it
is
very
abundant
this
is
considered
the
best
among
the
roots
used
for
food
to
us
it
was
an
interesting
plant
a
little
link
between
the
savage
and
civilized
life
here
among
the
indians
its
root
is
a
common
article
of
food
which
they
take
pleasure
in
offering
to
strangers
while
with
us
in
a
considerable
portion
of
america
and
europe
the
seeds
are
used
to
flavor
soup
it
grows
more
abundantly
and
in
greater
luxuriance
on
one
of
the
neighboring
tributaries
of
the
colorado
than
in
any
other
part
of
this
region
and
on
that
stream
to
which
the
snakes
are
accustomed
to
resort
every
year
to
procure
a
supply
of
their
favorite
plant
they
have
bestowed
the
name
of
river
among
the
trappers
it
is
generally
known
as
little
snake
river
but
in
this
and
other
instances
where
it
illustrated
the
history
of
the
people
inhabiting
the
country
i
have
preferred
to
retain
on
the
map
the
aboriginal
name
by
a
meridional
observation
the
latitude
is
in
the
afternoon
we
took
our
way
directly
across
the
spurs
from
the
point
of
the
mountain
where
we
had
several
ridges
to
cross
and
although
the
road
was
not
rendered
bad
by
the
nature
of
the
ground
it
was
made
extremely
rough
by
the
stiff
tough
bushes
of
footnote
the
greater
portion
of
our
subsequent
journey
was
through
a
region
where
this
shrub
constituted
the
tree
of
the
country
and
as
it
will
often
be
mentioned
in
occasional
descriptions
the
word
only
will
be
used
without
the
specific
name
in
this
country
commonly
called
sage
this
shrub
now
began
to
make
its
appearance
in
compact
fields
and
we
were
about
to
quit
for
a
long
time
this
country
of
excellent
pasturage
and
brilliant
flowers
ten
or
twelve
buffalo
bulls
were
seen
during
the
afternoon
and
we
were
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
a
large
red
ox
we
gathered
around
him
as
if
he
had
been
an
old
acquaintance
with
all
our
domestic
feelings
as
much
awakened
as
if
we
had
come
in
sight
of
an
old
he
had
probably
made
his
escape
from
some
party
of
emigrants
on
green
river
and
with
a
vivid
remembrance
of
some
old
green
field
be
was
pursuing
the
straightest
course
for
the
frontier
that
the
country
admitted
we
carried
him
along
with
us
as
a
prize
and
when
it
was
found
in
the
morning
that
he
had
wandered
off
i
would
not
let
him
be
pursued
for
i
would
rather
have
gone
through
a
starving
time
of
three
entire
days
than
let
him
be
killed
after
he
had
successfully
run
the
gauntlet
so
far
among
the
indians
i
have
been
told
by
mr
bent
people
of
an
ox
born
and
raised
at
vrain
fort
which
made
his
escape
from
them
at
elm
grove
near
the
frontier
having
come
in
that
year
with
the
wagons
they
were
on
their
way
out
and
saw
occasionally
places
where
he
had
eaten
and
laid
down
to
rest
but
did
not
see
him
for
about
miles
when
they
overtook
him
on
the
road
traveling
along
to
the
fort
having
unaccountably
escaped
indians
and
every
other
mischance
we
encamped
at
evening
on
the
principal
fork
of
medicine
bow
river
near
to
an
isolated
mountain
called
the
medicine
which
appeared
to
be
about
feet
above
the
plain
from
which
it
rises
abruptly
and
was
still
white
nearly
to
its
base
with
a
great
quantity
of
snow
the
streams
were
timbered
with
the
cottonwood
and
red
willow
and
during
the
afternoon
a
species
of
onion
was
very
abundant
i
obtained
here
an
immersion
of
the
first
satellite
of
jupiter
which
corresponding
very
nearly
with
the
chronometer
placed
us
in
longitude
the
latitude
by
observation
was
elevation
above
the
sea
feet
and
distance
from
vrain
fort
miles
there
was
a
white
frost
last
night
the
morning
is
clear
and
cool
we
were
early
on
the
road
having
breakfasted
before
sunrise
and
in
a
few
miles
travel
entered
the
pass
of
the
medicine
through
which
led
a
broad
trail
which
had
been
recently
traveled
by
a
very
large
party
immediately
in
the
pass
the
road
was
broken
by
ravines
and
we
were
obliged
to
clear
a
way
through
groves
of
aspens
which
generally
made
their
appearance
when
we
reached
elevated
regions
according
to
the
barometer
this
was
feet
and
while
we
were
detained
in
opening
a
road
i
obtained
a
meridional
observation
of
the
sun
which
gave
for
the
latitude
of
the
pass
the
medicine
is
isolated
by
a
small
tributary
of
the
north
fork
of
the
platte
but
the
mountains
approach
each
other
very
nearly
the
stream
running
at
their
feet
on
the
south
they
are
smooth
with
occasional
streaks
of
pine
but
the
butte
itself
is
ragged
with
escarpments
of
red
feldspathic
granite
and
dark
with
pines
the
snow
reaching
from
the
summit
to
within
a
few
hundred
feet
of
the
trail
the
granite
here
was
more
compact
and
durable
than
that
in
the
formation
which
we
had
passed
through
a
few
days
before
to
the
eastward
of
laramie
continuing
our
way
over
a
plain
on
the
west
side
of
the
pass
where
the
road
was
terribly
rough
with
artemisia
we
made
our
evening
encampment
on
the
creek
where
it
took
a
northern
direction
unfavorably
to
the
course
we
were
pursuing
bands
of
buffalo
were
discovered
as
we
came
down
upon
the
plain
and
carson
brought
into
the
camp
a
cow
which
had
the
fat
on
the
fleece
two
inches
thick
even
in
this
country
of
rich
pasturage
and
abundant
game
it
is
rare
that
a
hunter
chances
upon
a
finer
animal
our
voyage
had
already
been
long
but
this
was
the
first
good
buffalo
meat
we
had
obtained
we
traveled
miles
the
morning
was
clear
and
calm
and
leaving
the
creek
we
traveled
towards
the
north
fork
of
the
platte
over
a
plain
which
was
rendered
rough
and
broken
by
ravines
with
the
exception
of
some
thin
grasses
the
sandy
soil
here
was
occupied
almost
exclusively
by
artemisia
with
its
usual
turpentine
odor
we
had
expected
to
meet
with
some
difficulty
in
crossing
the
river
but
happened
to
strike
it
where
there
was
a
very
excellent
ford
and
halted
to
noon
on
the
left
bank
two
hundred
miles
from
vrain
fort
the
hunters
brought
in
loaded
with
fine
meat
according
to
our
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
country
there
should
have
been
a
small
affluent
to
this
stream
a
few
miles
higher
up
and
in
the
afternoon
we
continued
our
way
among
the
river
hills
in
the
expectation
of
encamping
upon
it
in
the
evening
the
ground
proved
to
be
so
exceedingly
difficult
broken
up
into
hills
terminating
in
escarpments
and
broad
ravines
five
hundred
or
six
hundred
feet
deep
with
sides
so
precipitous
that
we
could
scarcely
find
a
place
to
descend
that
towards
sunset
i
turned
directly
in
towards
the
river
and
after
nightfall
entered
a
sort
of
ravine
we
were
obliged
to
feel
our
way
and
clear
a
road
in
the
darkness
the
surface
being
much
broken
and
the
progress
of
the
carriages
being
greatly
obstructed
by
the
artemisia
which
had
a
luxuriant
growth
of
four
to
six
feet
in
height
we
had
scrambled
along
this
gulley
for
several
hours
during
which
we
had
knocked
off
the
broken
a
thermometer
and
several
small
articles
when
fearing
to
lose
something
of
more
importance
i
halted
for
the
night
at
ten
our
animals
were
turned
down
towards
the
river
that
they
might
pick
up
what
little
grass
they
could
find
and
after
a
little
search
some
water
was
found
in
a
small
ravine
and
improved
by
digging
we
lighted
up
the
ravine
with
fires
of
artemisia
and
about
midnight
sat
down
to
a
supper
which
we
were
hungry
enough
to
find
delightful
although
the
was
crusted
with
sand
and
the
coffee
was
bitter
with
the
wormwood
taste
of
the
artemisia
leaves
a
successful
day
hunt
had
kept
our
hunters
occupied
until
late
and
they
slept
out
but
rejoined
us
at
daybreak
when
finding
ourselves
only
about
a
mile
from
the
river
we
followed
the
ravine
down
and
camped
in
a
cottonwood
grove
on
a
beautiful
grassy
bottom
where
our
animals
indemnified
themselves
for
the
scanty
fare
of
the
past
night
it
was
quite
a
pretty
and
pleasant
place
a
narrow
strip
of
prairie
about
five
hundred
yards
long
terminated
at
the
ravine
where
we
entered
by
high
precipitous
hills
closing
in
upon
the
river
and
at
the
upper
end
by
a
ridge
of
low
rolling
hills
in
the
precipitous
bluffs
were
displayed
a
succession
of
strata
containing
fossil
vegetable
remains
and
several
beds
of
coal
in
some
of
the
beds
the
coal
did
not
appear
to
be
perfectly
mineralized
and
in
some
of
the
seams
it
was
compact
and
remarkably
lustrous
in
these
latter
places
there
were
also
thin
layers
of
a
very
fine
white
salts
in
powder
as
we
had
a
large
supply
of
meat
in
the
camp
which
it
was
necessary
to
dry
and
the
surrounding
country
appeared
to
be
well
stocked
with
buffalo
which
it
was
probable
after
a
day
or
two
we
would
not
see
again
until
our
return
to
the
mississippi
waters
i
determined
to
make
here
a
provision
of
dried
meat
which
would
be
necessary
for
our
subsistence
in
the
region
we
were
about
entering
which
was
said
to
be
nearly
destitute
of
game
scaffolds
were
accordingly
soon
erected
fires
made
and
the
meat
cut
into
thin
slices
to
be
dried
and
all
were
busily
occupied
when
the
camp
was
thrown
into
a
sudden
tumult
by
a
charge
from
about
seventy
mounted
indians
over
the
low
hills
at
the
upper
end
of
the
little
bottom
fortunately
the
guard
who
was
between
them
and
our
animals
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
indian
head
as
he
raised
himself
in
his
stirrups
to
look
over
the
hill
a
moment
before
he
made
the
charge
and
succeeded
in
turning
the
band
into
the
camp
as
the
indians
charged
into
the
bottom
with
the
usual
yell
before
they
reached
us
the
grove
on
the
verge
of
the
little
bottom
was
occupied
by
our
people
and
the
indians
brought
to
a
sudden
halt
which
they
made
in
time
to
save
themselves
from
a
howitzer
shot
which
would
undoubtedly
have
been
very
effective
in
such
a
compact
body
and
further
proceedings
were
interrupted
by
their
signs
for
peace
they
proved
to
be
a
war
party
of
arapaho
and
cheyenne
indians
and
informed
us
that
they
had
charged
upon
the
camp
under
the
belief
that
we
were
hostile
indians
and
had
discovered
their
mistake
only
at
the
moment
of
the
attack
an
excuse
which
policy
required
us
to
receive
as
true
though
under
the
full
conviction
that
the
display
of
our
little
howitzer
and
our
favorable
position
in
the
grove
certainly
saved
our
horses
and
probably
ourselves
from
their
marauding
intentions
they
had
been
on
a
war
party
and
had
been
defeated
and
were
consequently
in
the
state
of
mind
which
aggravates
their
innate
thirst
for
plunder
and
blood
their
excuse
however
was
taken
in
good
part
and
the
usual
evidences
of
friendship
interchanged
the
pipe
went
round
provisions
were
spread
and
the
tobacco
and
goods
furnished
the
customary
presents
which
they
look
for
even
from
traders
and
much
more
from
government
authorities
they
were
returning
from
an
expedition
against
the
shoshonee
indians
one
of
whose
villages
they
had
surprised
at
bridger
fort
on
fork
of
green
river
in
the
absence
of
the
men
who
were
engaged
in
an
antelope
surround
and
succeeded
in
carrying
off
their
horses
and
taking
several
scalps
news
of
the
attack
reached
the
snakes
immediately
who
pursued
and
overtook
them
and
recovered
their
horses
and
in
the
running
fight
which
ensued
the
arapahoes
had
lost
several
men
killed
and
a
number
wounded
who
were
coming
on
more
slowly
with
a
party
in
the
rear
nearly
all
the
horses
they
had
brought
off
were
the
property
of
the
whites
at
the
fort
after
remaining
until
nearly
sunset
they
took
their
departure
and
the
excitement
which
their
arrival
had
afforded
subsided
into
our
usual
quiet
a
little
enlivened
by
the
vigilance
rendered
necessary
by
the
neighborhood
of
our
uncertain
visiters
at
noon
the
thermometer
was
at
at
sunset
and
the
evening
clear
elevation
above
the
sea
feet
latitude
longitude
at
sunrise
the
thermometer
was
the
morning
being
clear
and
calm
we
traveled
over
an
extremely
rugged
country
barren
and
uninteresting
nothing
to
be
seen
but
artemisia
bushes
and
in
the
evening
found
a
grassy
spot
among
the
hills
kept
green
by
several
springs
where
we
encamped
late
within
a
few
hundred
yards
was
a
very
pretty
little
stream
of
clear
cool
water
whose
green
banks
looked
refreshing
among
the
dry
rocky
hills
the
hunters
brought
in
a
fat
mountain
sheep
our
road
the
next
day
was
through
a
continued
and
dense
field
of
which
now
entirely
covered
the
country
in
such
a
luxuriant
growth
that
it
was
difficult
and
laborious
for
a
man
on
foot
to
force
his
way
through
and
nearly
impracticable
for
our
light
carriages
the
region
through
which
we
were
traveling
was
a
high
plateau
constituting
the
dividing
ridge
between
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
and
extending
to
a
considerable
distance
southward
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
table
rock
at
the
southern
side
of
the
south
pass
though
broken
up
into
rugged
and
rocky
hills
of
a
dry
and
barren
nature
it
has
nothing
of
a
mountainous
character
the
small
streams
which
occasionally
occur
belonging
neither
to
the
platte
nor
the
colorado
but
losing
themselves
either
in
the
sand
or
in
small
lakes
from
an
eminence
in
the
afternoon
a
mountainous
range
became
visible
in
the
north
in
which
were
recognised
some
rocky
peaks
belonging
to
the
range
of
the
sweet
water
valley
and
determining
to
abandon
any
further
attempt
to
struggle
through
this
almost
impracticable
country
we
turned
our
course
directly
north
towards
a
pass
in
the
valley
of
the
sweet
water
river
a
shaft
of
the
was
broken
during
the
afternoon
causing
a
considerable
delay
and
it
was
late
in
an
unpleasant
evening
before
we
succeeded
in
finding
a
very
poor
encampment
where
there
was
a
little
water
in
a
deep
trench
of
a
creek
and
some
scanty
grass
among
the
shrubs
all
the
game
here
consisted
of
a
few
straggling
buffalo
bulls
and
during
the
day
there
had
been
but
very
little
grass
except
in
some
green
spots
where
it
had
collected
around
springs
or
shallow
lakes
within
fifty
miles
of
the
sweet
water
the
country
changed
into
a
vast
saline
plain
in
many
places
extremely
level
occasionally
resembling
the
flat
sandy
beds
of
shallow
lakes
here
the
vegetation
consisted
of
a
shrubby
growth
among
which
were
several
varieties
of
plants
but
the
characteristic
shrub
was
with
smaller
saline
shrubs
growing
with
singular
luxuriance
and
in
many
places
holding
exclusive
possession
of
the
ground
on
the
evening
of
the
we
encamped
on
one
of
these
lakes
which
the
traveler
considers
himself
fortunate
to
find
and
the
next
day
in
latitude
by
observation
halted
to
noon
immediately
at
the
foot
of
the
southern
side
of
the
range
which
walls
in
the
sweet
water
valley
on
the
head
of
a
small
tributary
to
that
river
continuing
in
the
afternoon
our
course
down
the
stream
which
here
cuts
directly
through
the
ridge
forming
a
very
practicable
pass
we
entered
the
valley
and
after
a
march
of
about
nine
miles
encamped
on
our
familiar
river
endeared
to
us
by
the
acquaintance
of
the
previous
expedition
the
night
having
already
closed
in
with
a
cold
our
camp
was
about
twenty
miles
above
the
devil
gate
which
we
had
been
able
to
see
in
coming
down
the
plain
and
in
the
course
of
the
night
the
clouds
broke
away
around
jupiter
for
a
short
time
during
which
we
obtained
an
emersion
of
the
first
satellite
the
result
of
which
agreed
very
nearly
with
the
chronometer
giving
for
the
mean
longitude
elevation
above
the
sea
feet
and
distance
from
vrain
fort
by
the
road
we
had
just
traveled
miles
here
passes
the
road
to
oregon
and
the
broad
smooth
highway
where
the
numerous
heavy
wagons
of
the
emigrants
had
entirely
beaten
and
crushed
the
artemisia
was
a
happy
exchange
to
our
poor
animals
for
the
sharp
rocks
and
tough
shrubs
among
which
they
had
been
toiling
so
long
and
we
moved
up
the
valley
rapidly
and
pleasantly
with
very
little
deviation
from
our
route
of
the
preceding
year
we
continued
up
the
valley
and
on
the
evening
of
the
encamped
on
the
sweet
water
at
a
point
where
the
road
turns
off
to
cross
to
the
plains
of
green
river
the
increased
coolness
of
the
weather
indicated
that
we
had
attained
a
greater
elevation
which
the
barometer
here
placed
at
feet
and
during
the
night
water
froze
in
the
lodge
the
morning
of
the
was
clear
and
cold
there
being
a
and
the
thermometer
a
little
before
sunrise
standing
at
leaving
this
encampment
our
last
on
the
waters
which
flow
towards
the
rising
sun
we
took
our
way
along
the
upland
towards
the
dividing
ridge
which
separates
the
atlantic
from
the
pacific
waters
and
crossed
it
by
a
road
some
miles
further
south
than
the
one
we
had
followed
on
our
return
in
we
crossed
very
near
the
table
mountain
at
the
southern
extremity
of
the
south
pass
which
is
near
twenty
miles
in
width
and
already
traversed
by
several
different
roads
selecting
as
well
as
i
could
in
the
scarcely
distinguishable
ascent
what
might
be
considered
the
dividing
ridge
in
this
remarkable
depression
in
the
mountain
i
took
a
barometrical
observation
which
gave
feet
for
the
elevation
above
the
gulf
of
mexico
you
will
remember
that
in
my
report
of
i
estimated
the
elevation
of
this
pass
at
about
feet
a
correct
observation
with
a
good
barometer
enables
me
to
give
it
with
more
precision
its
importance
as
the
great
gate
through
which
commerce
and
traveling
may
hereafter
pass
between
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
and
the
north
pacific
justifies
a
precise
notice
of
its
locality
and
distance
from
leading
points
in
addition
to
this
statement
of
its
elevation
as
stated
in
the
report
of
its
latitude
at
the
point
where
we
crossed
is
its
longitude
its
distance
from
the
mouth
of
the
kansas
by
the
common
traveling
route
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
great
platte
along
the
valley
of
that
river
according
to
our
survey
of
miles
and
its
distance
from
louis
about
miles
more
by
the
kansas
and
about
by
the
great
platte
route
these
additions
being
steamboat
conveyance
in
both
instances
from
this
pass
to
the
mouth
of
the
oregon
is
about
miles
by
the
common
traveling
route
so
that
under
a
general
point
of
view
it
may
be
assumed
to
be
about
between
the
mississippi
and
the
pacific
ocean
on
the
common
traveling
route
following
a
hollow
of
slight
and
easy
descent
in
which
was
very
soon
formed
a
little
tributary
to
the
gulf
of
california
for
the
waters
which
flow
west
from
the
south
pass
go
to
this
gulf
we
made
our
usual
halt
four
miles
from
the
pass
in
latitude
by
observation
entering
here
the
valley
of
green
river
the
great
colorado
of
the
west
and
inclining
very
much
to
the
southward
along
the
streams
which
form
the
sandy
river
the
road
led
for
several
days
over
dry
and
level
uninteresting
plains
to
which
a
low
scrubby
growth
of
artemisia
gave
a
uniform
dull
grayish
color
and
on
the
evening
of
the
we
encamped
in
the
mexican
territory
on
the
left
bank
of
green
river
miles
from
the
south
pass
in
longitude
and
latitude
distant
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
kansas
this
is
the
emigrant
road
to
oregon
which
bears
much
to
the
southward
to
avoid
the
mountains
about
the
western
heads
of
green
river
the
of
the
spaniards
crossing
the
river
here
about
feet
wide
by
a
very
good
ford
we
continued
to
descend
for
seven
or
eight
miles
on
a
pleasant
road
along
the
right
bank
of
the
stream
of
which
the
islands
and
shores
are
handsomely
timbered
with
cottonwood
the
refreshing
appearance
of
the
broad
river
with
its
timbered
shores
and
green
wooded
islands
in
contrast
to
its
dry
and
sandy
plains
probably
obtained
for
it
the
name
of
green
river
which
was
bestowed
on
it
by
the
spaniards
who
first
came
into
this
country
to
trade
some
years
ago
it
was
then
familiarly
known
as
the
or
prairie
hen
river
a
name
which
it
received
from
the
crows
to
whom
its
upper
waters
belong
and
on
which
this
bird
is
still
very
abundant
by
the
shoshonee
and
utah
indians
to
whom
belongs
for
a
considerable
distance
below
the
country
where
we
were
now
traveling
it
was
called
the
bitter
root
river
from
a
great
abundance
in
its
valley
of
a
plant
which
affords
them
one
of
their
favorite
roots
lower
down
from
brown
hole
to
the
southward
the
river
runs
through
lofty
chasms
walled
in
by
precipices
of
rock
and
even
among
the
wilder
tribes
which
inhabit
that
portion
of
its
course
i
have
heard
it
called
by
indian
refugees
from
the
california
settlements
the
rio
we
halted
to
noon
at
the
upper
end
of
a
large
bottom
near
some
old
houses
which
had
been
a
trading
post
in
lat
at
this
place
the
elevation
of
the
river
above
the
sea
is
feet
that
of
lewis
fork
of
the
columbia
at
fort
hall
is
according
to
our
subsequent
observations
feet
the
descent
of
each
stream
is
rapid
but
that
of
the
colorado
is
but
little
known
and
that
little
derived
from
vague
report
three
hundred
miles
of
its
lower
part
as
it
approaches
the
gulf
of
california
is
reported
to
be
smooth
and
tranquil
but
its
upper
part
is
manifestly
broken
into
many
falls
and
rapids
from
many
descriptions
of
trappers
it
is
probable
that
in
its
foaming
course
among
its
lofty
precipices
it
presents
many
scenes
of
wild
grandeur
and
though
offering
many
temptations
and
often
discussed
no
trappers
have
been
found
bold
enough
to
undertake
a
voyage
which
has
so
certain
a
prospect
of
a
fatal
termination
the
indians
have
strange
stories
of
beautiful
valleys
abounding
with
beaver
shut
up
among
inaccessible
walls
of
rock
in
the
lower
course
of
the
river
and
to
which
the
neighboring
indians
in
their
occasional
wars
with
the
spaniards
and
among
themselves
drive
their
herds
of
cattle
and
flocks
of
sheep
leaving
them
to
pasture
in
perfect
security
the
road
here
leaves
the
river
which
bends
considerably
to
the
east
and
in
the
afternoon
we
resumed
our
westerly
course
passing
over
a
somewhat
high
and
broken
country
and
about
sunset
after
a
travel
of
miles
reached
black
fork
of
the
green
river
a
shallow
stream
with
a
somewhat
sluggish
current
about
feet
wide
timbered
principally
with
willow
and
here
and
there
an
occasional
large
tree
at
three
in
the
morning
i
obtained
an
observation
of
an
emersion
of
the
first
satellite
of
jupiter
with
other
observations
the
heavy
wagons
have
so
completely
pulverized
the
soil
that
clouds
of
fine
light
dust
are
raised
by
the
slightest
wind
making
the
road
sometimes
very
disagreeable
leaving
our
encampment
at
six
in
the
morning
we
traveled
along
the
bottom
which
is
about
two
miles
wide
bordered
by
low
hills
in
which
the
strata
contained
handsome
and
very
distinct
vegetable
fossils
in
a
gully
a
short
distance
farther
up
the
river
and
underlying
these
was
exposed
a
stratum
of
an
impure
or
argillaceous
limestone
crossing
on
the
way
black
fork
where
it
is
one
foot
deep
and
forty
wide
with
clear
water
and
a
pebbly
bed
in
nine
miles
we
reached
ham
fork
a
tributary
to
the
former
stream
having
now
about
sixty
feet
breadth
and
a
few
inches
depth
of
water
it
is
wooded
with
thickets
of
red
willow
and
in
the
bottom
is
a
tolerably
strong
growth
of
grass
the
road
here
makes
a
traverse
of
twelve
miles
across
a
bend
of
the
river
passing
in
the
way
some
remarkable
hills
two
or
three
hundred
feet
high
with
frequent
and
nearly
vertical
escarpments
of
a
green
stone
consisting
of
an
argillaceous
carbonate
of
lime
alternating
with
strata
of
an
limestone
and
worked
into
picturesque
forms
by
wind
and
rain
at
two
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
the
river
again
having
made
miles
since
crossing
the
great
dividing
ridge
of
the
rocky
mountains
plants
have
been
very
few
in
variety
the
country
being
covered
principally
with
artemisia
we
passed
on
the
road
this
morning
the
grave
of
one
of
the
emigrants
being
the
second
we
had
seen
since
falling
into
their
trail
and
halted
to
noon
on
the
river
a
short
distance
above
the
shoshonee
woman
took
leave
of
us
here
expecting
to
find
some
of
her
relations
at
bridger
fort
which
is
only
a
mile
or
two
distant
on
a
fork
of
this
stream
in
the
evening
we
encamped
on
a
salt
creek
about
fifteen
feet
wide
having
traveled
miles
i
obtained
an
emersion
of
the
first
satellite
under
favorable
circumstances
the
night
being
still
and
clear
one
of
our
mules
died
here
and
in
this
portion
of
our
journey
we
lost
six
or
seven
of
our
animals
the
grass
which
the
country
had
lately
afforded
was
very
poor
and
insufficient
and
animals
which
have
been
accustomed
to
grain
become
soon
weak
and
unable
to
labor
when
reduced
to
no
other
nourishment
than
grass
the
american
horses
as
those
are
usually
called
which
are
brought
to
this
country
from
the
states
are
not
of
any
serviceable
value
until
after
they
have
remained
a
winter
in
the
country
and
become
accustomed
to
live
entirely
on
grass
desirous
to
avoid
every
delay
not
absolutely
necessary
i
sent
on
carson
in
advance
to
fort
hall
this
morning
to
make
arrangements
for
a
small
supply
of
provisions
a
few
miles
from
our
encampment
the
road
entered
a
high
ridge
which
the
trappers
called
the
little
mountain
connecting
the
utah
with
the
wind
river
chain
and
in
one
of
the
hills
near
which
we
passed
i
remarked
strata
of
a
conglomerate
formation
fragments
of
which
were
scattered
over
the
surface
we
crossed
a
ridge
of
this
conglomerate
the
road
passing
near
a
grove
of
low
cedar
and
descending
upon
one
of
the
heads
of
ham
fork
called
muddy
where
we
made
our
halt
in
the
river
hills
at
this
place
i
discovered
strata
of
fossiliferous
rock
having
an
which
in
connection
with
the
neighboring
strata
authorize
us
to
believe
that
here
on
the
west
side
of
the
rocky
mountains
we
find
repeated
the
modern
formations
of
great
britain
and
europe
which
have
hitherto
been
wanting
to
complete
the
system
of
north
american
geology
in
the
afternoon
we
continued
our
road
and
searching
among
the
hills
a
few
miles
up
the
stream
and
on
the
same
bank
i
discovered
among
the
alternate
beds
of
coal
and
clay
a
stratum
of
white
indurated
clay
containing
very
clear
and
beautiful
impressions
of
vegetable
remains
this
was
the
most
interesting
fossil
locality
i
had
met
in
the
country
and
i
deeply
regretted
that
time
did
not
permit
me
to
remain
a
day
or
two
in
the
vicinity
but
i
could
not
anticipate
the
delays
to
which
i
might
be
exposed
in
the
course
of
our
journey
or
rather
i
knew
that
they
were
many
and
inevitable
and
after
remaining
here
only
about
an
hour
i
hurried
off
loaded
with
as
many
specimens
as
i
could
conveniently
carry
coal
made
its
appearance
occasionally
in
the
hills
during
the
afternoon
and
was
displayed
in
rabbit
burrows
in
a
kind
of
gap
through
which
we
passed
over
some
high
hills
and
we
descended
to
make
our
encampment
on
the
same
stream
where
we
found
but
very
poor
grass
in
the
evening
a
fine
cow
with
her
calf
which
had
strayed
off
from
some
emigrant
party
was
found
several
miles
from
the
road
and
brought
into
camp
and
as
she
gave
an
abundance
of
milk
we
enjoyed
an
excellent
cup
of
coffee
we
traveled
miles
and
as
has
been
usual
since
crossing
the
green
river
the
road
has
been
very
dusty
and
the
weather
smoky
and
oppressively
hot
artemisia
was
characteristic
among
the
few
plants
we
continued
to
travel
up
the
creek
by
a
very
gradual
ascent
and
a
very
excellent
grassy
road
passing
on
the
way
several
small
forks
of
the
stream
the
hills
here
are
higher
presenting
escarpments
of
and
apparently
clay
rocks
purple
and
yellow
containing
strata
of
sandstone
and
limestone
with
shells
with
a
bed
of
cemented
pebbles
the
whole
overlaid
by
beds
of
limestone
the
alternation
of
red
and
yellow
gives
a
bright
appearance
to
the
hills
one
of
which
was
called
by
our
people
the
rainbow
hill
and
the
character
of
the
country
became
more
agreeable
and
traveling
far
more
pleasant
as
now
we
found
timber
and
very
good
grass
gradually
ascending
we
reached
the
lower
level
of
a
bed
of
white
limestone
lying
upon
a
white
clay
on
the
upper
line
of
which
the
whole
road
is
abundantly
supplied
with
beautiful
cool
springs
gushing
out
a
foot
in
breadth
and
several
inches
deep
directly
from
the
at
noon
we
halted
at
the
last
main
fork
of
the
creek
at
an
elevation
of
feet
and
in
latitude
by
observation
and
in
the
afternoon
continued
on
the
same
excellent
road
up
the
left
or
northern
fork
of
the
stream
towards
its
head
in
a
pass
which
the
barometer
placed
at
feet
above
the
sea
this
is
a
connecting
ridge
between
the
utah
or
bear
river
mountains
and
the
wind
river
chain
of
the
rocky
mountains
separating
the
waters
of
the
gulf
of
california
on
the
east
and
those
on
the
west
belonging
more
directly
to
the
pacific
from
a
vast
interior
basin
whose
rivers
are
collected
into
numerous
lakes
having
no
outlet
to
the
ocean
from
the
summit
of
this
pass
the
highest
which
the
road
crosses
between
the
mississippi
and
the
western
ocean
our
view
was
over
a
very
mountainous
region
whose
rugged
appearance
was
greatly
increased
by
the
smoky
weather
through
which
the
broken
ridges
were
dark
and
dimly
seen
the
ascent
to
the
summit
of
the
gap
was
occasionally
steeper
than
the
national
road
in
the
alleghanies
and
the
descent
by
way
of
a
spur
on
the
western
side
is
rather
precipitous
but
the
pass
may
still
be
called
a
good
one
some
thickets
of
the
willow
in
the
hollows
below
deceived
us
into
the
expectation
of
finding
a
camp
at
our
usual
hour
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
but
we
found
them
without
water
and
continued
down
a
ravine
and
encamped
about
dark
at
a
place
where
the
springs
began
again
to
make
their
appearance
but
where
our
animals
fared
badly
the
stock
of
the
emigrants
having
razed
the
grass
as
completely
as
if
we
were
again
in
the
midst
of
the
buffalo
an
hour
travel
this
morning
brought
us
into
the
fertile
and
picturesque
valley
of
bear
river
the
principal
tributary
to
the
great
salt
lake
the
stream
is
here
two
hundred
feet
wide
fringed
with
willows
and
occasional
groups
of
hawthorns
we
were
now
entering
a
region
which
for
us
possessed
a
strange
and
extraordinary
interest
we
were
upon
the
waters
of
the
famous
lake
which
forms
a
salient
point
among
the
remarkable
geographical
features
of
the
country
and
around
which
the
vague
and
superstitious
accounts
of
the
trappers
had
thrown
a
delightful
obscurity
which
we
anticipated
pleasure
in
dispelling
but
which
in
the
mean
time
left
a
crowded
field
for
the
exercise
of
our
imagination
in
our
occasional
conversations
with
the
few
old
hunters
who
had
visited
the
region
it
had
been
a
subject
of
frequent
speculation
and
the
wonders
which
they
related
were
not
the
less
agreeable
because
they
were
highly
exaggerated
and
impossible
hitherto
this
lake
had
been
seen
only
by
trappers
who
were
wandering
through
the
country
in
search
of
new
caring
very
little
for
geography
its
islands
had
never
been
visited
and
none
were
to
be
found
who
had
entirely
made
the
circuit
of
its
shores
and
no
instrumental
observations
or
geographical
survey
of
any
description
had
ever
been
made
anywhere
in
the
neighboring
region
it
was
generally
supposed
that
it
had
no
visible
outlet
but
among
the
trappers
including
those
in
my
own
camp
were
many
who
believed
that
somewhere
on
its
surface
was
a
terrible
whirlpool
through
which
its
waters
found
their
way
to
the
ocean
by
some
subterranean
communication
all
these
things
had
made
a
frequent
subject
of
discussion
in
our
desultory
conversations
around
the
fires
at
night
and
my
own
mind
had
become
tolerably
well
filled
with
their
indefinite
pictures
and
insensibly
colored
with
their
romantic
descriptions
which
in
the
pleasure
of
excitement
i
was
well
disposed
to
believe
and
half
expected
to
realize
where
we
descended
into
this
beautiful
valley
it
is
three
to
four
miles
in
breadth
perfectly
level
and
bounded
by
mountainous
ridges
one
above
another
rising
suddenly
from
the
plain
we
continued
our
road
down
the
river
and
at
night
encamped
with
a
family
of
emigrants
two
men
women
and
several
children
who
appeared
to
be
bringing
up
the
rear
of
the
great
caravan
i
was
struck
with
the
fine
appearance
of
their
cattle
some
six
or
eight
yoke
of
oxen
which
really
looked
as
well
as
if
they
had
been
all
the
summer
at
work
on
some
good
farm
it
was
strange
to
see
one
small
family
traveling
along
through
such
a
country
so
remote
from
civilization
some
nine
years
since
such
a
security
might
have
been
a
fatal
one
but
since
their
disastrous
defeats
in
the
country
a
little
north
the
blackfeet
have
ceased
to
visit
these
waters
indians
however
are
very
uncertain
in
their
localities
and
the
friendly
feelings
also
of
those
now
inhabiting
it
may
be
changed
according
to
barometrical
observation
at
noon
the
elevation
of
the
valley
was
feet
above
the
sea
and
our
encampment
at
night
in
latitude
and
longitude
by
observation
the
day
journey
having
been
miles
this
encampment
was
therefore
within
the
territorial
limit
of
the
united
states
our
traveling
from
the
time
we
entered
the
valley
of
the
green
river
on
the
of
august
having
been
south
of
the
degree
of
north
latitude
and
consequently
on
mexican
territory
and
this
is
the
route
all
the
emigrants
now
travel
to
oregon
the
temperature
at
sunset
was
and
at
evening
there
was
a
distant
with
a
light
breeze
from
the
north
antelope
and
elk
were
seen
during
the
day
on
the
opposite
prairie
and
there
were
ducks
and
geese
in
the
river
the
next
morning
in
about
three
miles
from
our
encampment
we
reached
smith
fork
a
stream
of
clear
water
about
feet
in
breadth
it
is
timbered
with
cottonwood
willow
and
aspen
and
makes
a
beautiful
debouchement
through
a
pass
about
yards
wide
between
remarkable
mountain
hills
rising
abruptly
on
either
side
and
forming
gigantic
columns
to
the
gate
by
which
it
enters
bear
river
valley
the
bottoms
which
below
smith
fork
had
been
two
miles
wide
narrowed
as
we
advanced
to
a
gap
yards
wide
and
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
we
had
a
winding
route
the
river
making
very
sharp
and
sudden
bends
the
mountains
steep
and
rocky
and
the
valley
occasionally
so
narrow
as
only
to
leave
space
for
a
passage
through
we
made
our
halt
at
noon
in
a
fertile
bottom
where
the
common
blue
flax
was
growing
abundantly
a
few
miles
below
the
mouth
of
fork
one
of
the
larger
tributaries
of
the
river
crossing
in
the
afternoon
the
point
of
a
narrow
spur
we
descended
into
a
beautiful
bottom
formed
by
a
lateral
valley
which
presented
a
picture
of
home
beauty
that
went
directly
to
our
hearts
the
edge
of
the
wood
for
several
miles
along
the
river
was
dotted
with
the
white
covers
of
emigrant
wagons
collected
in
groups
at
different
camps
where
the
smoke
was
rising
lazily
from
the
fires
around
which
the
women
were
occupied
in
preparing
the
evening
meal
and
the
children
playing
in
the
grass
and
herds
of
cattle
grazing
about
in
the
bottom
had
an
air
of
quiet
security
and
civilized
comfort
that
made
a
rare
sight
for
the
traveler
in
such
a
remote
wilderness
in
common
with
all
the
emigration
they
had
been
reposing
for
several
days
in
this
delightful
valley
in
order
to
recruit
their
animals
on
its
luxuriant
pasturage
after
their
long
journey
and
prepare
them
for
the
hard
travel
along
the
comparatively
sterile
banks
of
the
upper
columbia
at
the
lower
end
of
this
extensive
bottom
the
river
passes
through
an
open
canon
where
there
were
high
vertical
rocks
to
the
water
edge
and
the
road
here
turns
up
a
broad
valley
to
the
right
it
was
already
near
sunset
but
hoping
to
reach
the
river
again
before
night
we
continued
our
march
along
the
valley
finding
the
road
tolerably
good
until
we
arrived
at
a
point
where
it
crosses
the
ridge
by
an
ascent
of
a
mile
in
length
which
was
so
very
steep
and
difficult
for
the
gun
and
carriage
that
we
did
not
reach
the
summit
until
dark
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
descend
into
the
valley
for
water
and
grass
and
we
were
obliged
to
grope
our
way
in
the
darkness
down
a
very
steep
bad
mountain
reaching
the
river
at
about
ten
it
was
late
before
our
animals
were
gathered
into
the
camp
several
of
those
which
were
very
weak
being
necessarily
left
to
pass
the
night
on
the
ridge
and
we
sat
down
again
to
a
midnight
supper
the
road
in
the
morning
presented
an
animated
appearance
we
found
that
we
had
encamped
near
a
large
party
of
emigrants
and
a
few
miles
below
another
party
was
already
in
motion
here
the
valley
had
resumed
its
usual
breadth
and
the
river
swept
off
along
the
mountains
on
the
western
side
the
road
continuing
directly
on
in
about
an
hour
travel
we
met
several
shoshonee
indians
who
informed
us
that
they
belonged
to
a
large
village
which
had
just
come
into
the
valley
from
the
mountain
to
the
westward
where
they
had
been
hunting
antelope
and
gathering
glad
at
the
opportunity
of
seeing
one
of
their
villages
and
in
the
hope
of
purchasing
from
them
a
few
horses
i
turned
immediately
off
into
the
plain
towards
their
encampment
which
was
situated
on
a
small
stream
near
the
river
we
had
approached
within
something
more
than
a
mile
of
the
village
when
suddenly
a
single
horseman
emerged
from
it
at
full
speed
followed
by
another
and
another
in
rapid
succession
and
then
party
after
party
poured
into
the
plain
until
when
the
foremost
rider
reached
us
all
the
whole
intervening
plain
was
occupied
by
a
mass
of
horsemen
which
came
charging
down
upon
us
with
guns
and
naked
swords
lances
and
bows
and
arrows
indians
entirely
naked
and
warriors
fully
dressed
for
war
with
the
long
red
streamers
of
their
reaching
nearly
to
the
ground
all
mingled
together
in
the
bravery
of
savage
warfare
they
had
been
thrown
into
a
sudden
tumult
by
the
appearance
of
our
flag
which
among
these
people
is
regarded
as
an
emblem
of
hostility
it
being
usually
borne
by
the
sioux
and
the
neighboring
mountain
indians
when
they
come
here
to
war
and
we
had
accordingly
been
mistaken
for
a
body
of
their
enemies
a
few
words
from
the
chief
quieted
the
excitement
and
the
whole
band
increasing
every
moment
in
number
escorted
us
to
their
encampment
where
the
chief
pointed
out
a
place
for
us
to
encamp
near
his
own
lodge
and
we
made
known
our
purpose
in
visiting
the
village
in
a
very
short
time
we
purchased
eight
horses
for
which
we
gave
in
exchange
blankets
red
and
blue
cloth
beads
knives
and
tobacco
and
the
usual
other
articles
of
indian
traffic
we
obtained
from
them
also
a
considerable
quantity
of
berries
of
different
kinds
among
which
were
the
most
abundant
and
several
kinds
of
roots
and
seeds
which
we
could
eat
with
pleasure
as
any
kind
of
vegetable
food
was
gratifying
to
us
i
ate
here
for
the
first
time
the
or
the
principal
edible
root
among
the
indians
who
inhabit
the
upper
waters
of
the
streams
on
the
western
side
of
the
mountains
it
has
a
very
strong
and
remarkably
peculiar
taste
and
odor
which
i
can
compare
to
no
other
vegetable
that
i
am
acquainted
with
and
which
to
some
persons
is
extremely
offensive
it
was
characterized
by
preuss
as
the
most
horrid
food
he
had
ever
put
in
his
mouth
and
when
in
the
evening
one
of
the
chiefs
sent
his
wife
to
me
with
a
portion
which
she
had
prepared
as
a
delicacy
to
regale
us
the
odor
immediately
drove
him
out
of
the
lodge
and
frequently
afterwards
he
used
to
beg
that
when
those
who
liked
it
had
taken
what
they
desired
it
might
be
sent
away
to
others
however
the
taste
is
rather
an
agreeable
one
and
i
was
afterwards
glad
when
it
formed
an
addition
to
our
scanty
meals
it
is
full
of
nutriment
and
in
its
unprepared
state
is
said
by
the
indians
to
have
very
strong
poisonous
qualities
of
which
it
is
deprived
by
a
peculiar
process
being
baked
in
the
ground
for
about
two
days
the
morning
of
the
was
disagreeably
cool
with
an
easterly
wind
and
very
smoky
weather
we
made
a
late
start
from
the
village
and
regaining
the
road
on
which
during
all
the
day
were
scattered
the
emigrant
wagons
we
continued
on
down
the
valley
of
the
river
bordered
by
high
and
mountainous
hills
on
which
fires
are
seen
at
the
summit
the
soil
appears
generally
good
although
with
the
grasses
many
of
the
plants
are
dried
up
probably
on
account
of
the
great
heat
and
want
of
rain
the
common
blue
flax
of
cultivation
now
almost
entirely
in
seed
only
a
scattered
flower
here
and
there
remaining
is
the
most
characteristic
plant
of
the
bear
river
valley
when
we
encamped
at
night
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
it
was
growing
as
in
a
sown
field
we
had
traveled
during
the
day
miles
encamping
in
latitude
by
observation
chronometric
longitude
in
our
neighborhood
the
mountains
appeared
extremely
rugged
giving
still
greater
value
to
this
beautiful
natural
pass
this
was
a
cloudless
but
smoky
autumn
morning
with
a
cold
wind
from
the
southeast
and
a
temperature
of
at
sunrise
in
a
few
miles
i
noticed
where
a
little
stream
crossed
the
road
fragments
of
scattered
about
the
first
volcanic
rock
we
had
seen
and
which
now
became
a
characteristic
rock
along
our
future
road
in
about
six
miles
travel
from
our
encampment
we
reached
one
of
the
points
in
our
journey
to
which
we
had
always
looked
forward
with
great
interest
the
famous
the
place
in
which
they
are
situated
is
a
basin
of
mineral
waters
enclosed
by
the
mountains
which
sweep
around
a
circular
bend
of
bear
river
here
at
its
most
northern
point
and
which
from
a
northern
in
the
course
of
a
few
miles
acquires
a
southern
direction
towards
the
great
salt
lake
a
pretty
little
stream
of
clear
water
enters
the
upper
part
of
the
basin
from
an
open
valley
in
the
mountains
and
passing
through
the
bottom
discharges
into
bear
river
crossing
this
stream
we
descended
a
mile
below
and
made
our
encampment
in
a
grove
of
cedar
immediately
at
the
beer
springs
which
on
account
of
the
effervescing
gas
and
acid
taste
have
received
their
name
from
the
voyageurs
and
trappers
of
the
country
who
in
the
midst
of
their
rude
and
hard
lives
are
fond
of
finding
some
fancied
resemblance
to
the
luxuries
they
rarely
have
the
fortune
to
enjoy
although
somewhat
disappointed
in
the
expectations
which
various
descriptions
had
led
me
to
form
of
unusual
beauty
of
situation
and
scenery
i
found
it
altogether
a
place
of
very
great
interest
and
a
traveler
for
the
first
time
in
a
volcanic
region
remains
in
a
constant
excitement
and
at
every
step
is
arrested
by
something
remarkable
and
new
there
is
a
confusion
of
interesting
objects
gathered
together
in
a
small
space
around
the
place
of
encampment
the
beer
springs
were
numerous
but
as
far
as
we
could
ascertain
were
confined
entirely
to
that
locality
in
the
bottom
in
the
bed
of
the
river
in
front
for
a
space
of
several
hundred
yards
they
were
very
abundant
the
effervescing
gas
rising
up
and
agitating
the
water
in
countless
bubbling
columns
in
the
vicinity
round
about
were
numerous
springs
of
an
entirely
different
and
equally
marked
mineral
character
in
a
rather
picturesque
spot
about
yards
below
our
encampment
and
immediately
on
the
river
bank
is
the
most
remarkable
spring
of
the
place
in
an
opening
on
the
rock
a
white
column
of
scattered
water
is
thrown
up
in
form
like
a
to
a
variable
height
of
about
three
feet
and
though
it
is
maintained
in
a
constant
supply
its
greatest
height
is
only
attained
at
regular
intervals
according
to
the
action
of
the
force
below
it
is
accompanied
by
a
subterranean
noise
which
together
with
the
motion
of
the
water
makes
very
much
the
impression
of
a
steamboat
in
motion
and
without
knowing
that
it
had
been
already
previously
so
called
we
gave
to
it
the
name
of
the
the
rock
through
which
it
is
forced
is
slightly
raised
in
a
convex
manner
and
gathered
at
the
opening
into
an
form
and
is
evidently
formed
by
continued
deposition
from
the
water
and
colored
bright
red
by
oxide
of
iron
an
analysis
of
this
deposited
rock
which
i
subjoin
will
give
you
some
idea
of
the
properties
of
the
water
which
with
the
exception
of
the
beer
springs
is
the
mineral
water
of
the
place
footnote

carbonate
of
lime
carbonate
of

oxide
of
iron
alumina
water
and
it
is
a
hot
spring
and
the
water
has
a
pungent
and
disagreeable
metallic
taste
leaving
a
burning
effect
on
the
tongue
within
perhaps
two
yards
of
the
is
a
small
hole
of
about
an
inch
in
diameter
through
which
at
regular
intervals
escapes
a
blast
of
hot
air
with
a
light
wreath
of
smoke
accompanied
by
a
regular
noise
this
hole
had
been
noticed
by
wislizenus
a
gentleman
who
had
several
years
since
passed
by
this
place
and
who
remarked
with
very
nice
observation
that
smelling
the
gas
which
issued
from
the
orifice
produced
a
sensation
of
giddiness
and
nausea
preuss
and
myself
repeated
the
observation
and
were
so
well
satisfied
with
its
correctness
that
we
did
not
find
it
pleasant
to
continue
the
experiment
as
the
sensation
of
giddiness
which
it
produced
was
certainly
strong
and
decided
a
huge
emigrant
wagon
with
a
large
and
diversified
family
had
overtaken
us
and
halted
to
noon
at
our
encampment
and
while
we
were
sitting
at
the
spring
a
band
of
boys
and
girls
with
two
or
three
young
men
came
up
one
of
whom
i
asked
to
stoop
down
and
smell
the
gas
desirous
to
satisfy
myself
further
of
its
effects
but
his
natural
caution
had
been
awakened
by
the
singular
and
suspicious
features
of
the
place
and
he
declined
my
proposal
decidedly
and
with
a
few
indistinct
remarks
about
the
devil
whom
he
seemed
to
consider
the
the
ceaseless
motion
and
the
play
of
the
fountain
the
red
rock
and
the
green
trees
near
make
this
a
picturesque
spot
a
short
distance
above
the
spring
and
near
the
foot
of
the
same
spur
is
a
very
remarkable
rock
soft
and
friable
consisting
principally
of
carbonate
of
lime
and
oxide
of
iron
of
regular
structure
which
is
probably
a
fossil
coral
the
rocky
bank
along
the
shore
between
the
steamboat
spring
and
our
encampment
along
which
is
dispersed
the
water
from
the
hills
is
composed
entirely
of
strata
of
a
calcareous
with
the
remains
of
moss
and
grasses
which
is
probably
the
formation
of
springs
the
or
which
have
given
name
to
this
locality
are
agreeable
but
less
highly
flavored
than
the
boiling
springs
at
the
foot
of
peak
which
are
of
the
same
character
they
are
very
numerous
and
half
hidden
by
tufts
of
grass
which
we
amused
ourselves
in
removing
and
searching
about
for
more
highly
impregnated
springs
they
are
some
of
them
deep
and
of
various
sizes
sometimes
several
yards
in
diameter
and
kept
in
constant
motion
by
columns
of
escaping
gas
by
analysis
one
quart
of
the
water
contains
as
follows
grains
sulphate
of

sulphate
of

carbonate
of

of

c
the
carbonic
acid
originally
contained
in
the
water
had
mainly
escaped
before
it
was
subjected
to
analysis
and
it
was
not
therefore
taken
into
consideration
in
the
afternoon
i
wandered
about
among
the
cedars
which
occupy
the
greater
part
of
the
bottom
towards
the
mountains
the
soil
here
has
a
dry
and
calcined
appearance
in
some
places
the
open
grounds
are
covered
with
saline
efflorescences
and
there
are
a
number
of
and
very
remarkable
hills
which
are
formed
of
a
succession
of
convex
strata
that
have
been
deposited
by
the
waters
of
extinct
springs
the
orifices
of
which
are
found
on
their
summits
some
of
them
having
the
form
of
cones
others
of
these
hills
are
of
a
earth
entirely
bare
and
composed
principally
of
carbonate
of
lime
with
oxide
of
iron
formed
in
the
same
manner
walking
near
one
of
them
on
the
summit
of
which
the
springs
were
dry
my
attention
was
attracted
by
an
underground
noise
around
which
i
circled
repeatedly
until
i
found
the
spot
from
beneath
which
it
came
and
removing
the
red
earth
discovered
a
hidden
spring
which
was
boiling
up
from
below
with
the
same
disagreeable
metallic
taste
as
the
steamboat
spring
continuing
up
the
bottom
and
crossing
the
little
stream
which
has
been
already
mentioned
i
visited
several
remarkable
red
and
white
hills
which
had
attracted
my
attention
from
the
road
in
the
morning
these
are
immediately
upon
the
stream
and
like
those
already
mentioned
are
formed
by
the
deposition
of
successive
strata
from
the
springs
on
their
summits
the
orifices
through
which
the
waters
had
been
discharged
were
so
large
that
they
resembled
miniature
craters
being
some
of
them
several
feet
in
diameter
circular
and
regularly
formed
as
if
by
art
at
a
former
time
when
these
fountains
were
all
in
motion
they
must
have
made
a
beautiful
display
on
a
grand
scale
and
nearly
all
this
basin
appears
to
me
to
have
been
formed
under
their
action
and
should
be
called
the
of
at
the
foot
of
one
of
these
hills
or
rather
on
its
side
near
the
base
are
several
of
these
small
limestone
columns
about
one
foot
in
diameter
at
the
base
and
tapering
upwards
to
a
height
of
three
or
four
feet
and
on
the
summit
the
water
is
boiling
up
and
bubbling
over
constantly
adding
to
the
height
of
the
little
obelisks
in
some
the
water
only
boils
up
no
longer
overflowing
and
has
here
the
same
taste
as
at
the
steamboat
spring
the
observer
will
remark
a
gradual
subsidence
in
the
water
which
formerly
supplied
the
fountains
as
on
all
the
summits
of
the
hills
the
springs
are
now
dry
and
are
found
only
low
down
upon
their
sides
or
on
the
surrounding
plain
a
little
higher
up
the
creek
its
banks
are
formed
by
strata
of
very
heavy
and
hard
scoriaceous
basalt
having
a
bright
metallic
lustre
when
broken
the
mountains
overlooking
the
plain
are
of
an
entirely
different
geological
character
continuing
on
i
walked
to
the
summit
of
one
of
them
where
the
principal
rock
was
a
granular
quartz
descending
the
mountains
and
returning
towards
the
camp
along
the
base
of
the
ridge
which
skirts
the
plain
i
found
at
the
foot
of
a
mountain
spur
and
issuing
from
a
compact
rock
of
a
dark
blue
color
a
great
number
of
springs
having
the
same
pungent
and
disagreeably
metallic
taste
already
mentioned
the
water
of
which
was
collected
into
a
very
remarkable
basin
whose
singularity
perhaps
made
it
appear
to
me
very
beautiful
it
is
large
perhaps
fifty
yards
in
circumference
and
in
it
the
water
is
contained
at
an
elevation
of
several
feet
above
the
surrounding
ground
by
a
wall
of
calcareous
composed
principally
of
the
remains
of
mosses
three
or
four
and
sometimes
ten
feet
high
the
water
within
is
very
clear
and
pure
and
three
or
four
feet
deep
where
it
could
be
measured
near
the
wall
and
at
a
considerably
low
level
is
another
pond
or
basin
of
very
clear
water
and
apparently
of
considerable
depth
from
the
bottom
of
which
the
gas
was
escaping
in
bubbling
columns
at
many
places
this
water
was
collected
into
a
small
stream
which
in
a
few
hundred
yards
sank
under
ground
reappearing
among
the
rocks
between
the
two
great
springs
near
the
river
which
it
entered
by
a
little
fall
late
in
the
afternoon
i
set
out
on
my
return
to
the
camp
and
crossing
in
the
way
a
large
field
of
salt
that
was
several
inches
deep
found
on
my
arrival
that
our
emigrant
friends
who
had
been
encamped
in
company
with
us
had
resumed
their
journey
and
the
road
had
again
assumed
its
solitary
character
the
temperature
of
the
largest
of
the
springs
at
our
encampment
was
at
sunset
that
of
the
air
being
our
barometric
observation
gave
feet
for
the
elevation
above
the
gulf
being
about
feet
lower
than
the
boiling
springs
which
are
of
a
similar
nature
at
the
foot
of
pike
peak
the
astronomical
observations
gave
for
our
latitude
and
for
the
longitude
the
night
was
very
still
and
cloudless
and
i
sat
up
for
an
observation
of
the
first
satellite
of
jupiter
the
emersion
of
which
took
place
about
midnight
but
fell
asleep
at
the
telescope
awaking
just
a
few
minutes
after
the
appearance
of
the
star
the
morning
of
the
was
calm
and
the
sky
without
clouds
but
smoky
and
the
temperature
at
sunrise
at
the
same
time
the
temperature
of
the
large
beer
spring
where
we
were
encamped
was
that
of
the
steamboat
spring
and
that
of
the
near
it
in
the
course
of
the
morning
the
last
wagons
of
the
emigration
passed
by
and
we
were
again
left
in
our
place
in
the
rear
remaining
in
camp
until
nearly
we
traveled
a
short
distance
down
the
river
and
halted
to
noon
on
the
bank
at
a
point
where
the
road
quits
the
valley
of
bear
river
and
crossing
a
ridge
which
divides
the
great
basin
from
the
pacific
waters
reaches
fort
hall
by
way
of
the
portneuf
river
in
a
distance
of
probably
fifty
miles
or
two
and
a
half
days
journey
for
wagons
an
examination
of
the
great
lake
which
is
the
outlet
of
this
river
and
the
principal
feature
of
geographical
interest
in
the
basin
was
one
of
the
main
objects
contemplated
in
the
general
plan
of
our
survey
and
i
accordingly
determined
at
this
place
to
leave
the
road
and
after
having
completed
a
reconnoissance
of
the
lake
regain
it
subsequently
at
fort
hall
but
our
little
stock
of
provisions
had
again
become
extremely
low
we
had
only
dried
meat
sufficient
for
one
meal
and
our
supply
of
flour
and
other
comforts
was
entirely
exhausted
i
therefore
immediately
dispatched
one
of
the
party
henry
lee
with
a
note
to
carson
at
fort
hall
directing
him
to
load
a
with
whatever
could
be
obtained
there
in
the
way
of
provisions
and
endeavor
to
overtake
me
on
the
river
in
the
mean
time
we
had
picked
up
along
the
road
two
tolerably
calves
which
would
have
become
food
for
wolves
and
which
had
probably
been
left
by
some
of
the
earlier
emigrants
none
of
those
we
had
met
having
made
any
claim
to
them
and
on
these
i
mainly
relied
for
support
during
our
circuit
to
the
lake
in
sweeping
around
the
point
of
the
mountain
which
runs
down
into
the
bend
the
river
here
passes
between
perpendicular
walls
of
basalt
which
always
fix
the
attention
from
the
regular
form
in
which
it
occurs
and
its
perfect
distinctness
from
the
surrounding
rocks
among
which
it
had
been
placed
the
mountain
which
is
rugged
and
steep
and
by
our
measurement
feet
above
the
river
directly
opposite
the
place
of
our
halt
is
called
the
probably
because
a
flock
of
the
mountain
sheep
had
been
seen
on
the
craggy
point
as
we
were
about
resuming
our
march
in
the
afternoon
i
was
attracted
by
the
singular
appearance
of
an
isolated
hill
with
a
concave
summit
in
the
plain
about
two
miles
from
the
river
and
turned
off
towards
it
while
the
camp
proceeded
on
its
way
southward
in
search
of
the
lake
i
found
the
thin
and
stony
soil
of
the
plain
entirely
underlaid
by
the
basalt
which
forms
the
river
walls
and
when
i
reached
the
neighborhood
of
the
hill
the
surface
of
the
plain
was
rent
into
frequent
fissures
and
chasms
of
the
same
scoriated
volcanic
rock
from
to
feet
deep
but
which
there
was
not
sufficient
light
to
penetrate
entirely
and
which
i
had
not
time
to
descend
arrived
at
the
summit
of
the
hill
i
found
that
it
terminated
in
a
very
perfect
crater
of
an
oval
or
nearly
circular
form
paces
in
circumference
and
feet
at
the
greatest
depth
the
walls
which
were
perfectly
vertical
and
disposed
like
masonry
in
a
very
regular
manner
were
composed
of
a
scoriaceous
lava
similar
to
the
light
scoriaceous
lava
of
mt
etna
vesuvius
and
other
volcanoes
the
faces
of
the
walls
were
reddened
and
glazed
by
the
fire
in
which
they
had
been
melted
and
which
had
left
them
contorted
and
twisted
by
its
violent
action
our
route
luring
the
afternoon
was
a
little
rough
being
in
the
direction
we
had
taken
over
a
volcanic
plain
where
our
progress
was
sometimes
obstructed
by
fissures
and
black
beds
composed
of
fragments
of
the
rock
on
both
sides
the
mountains
appeared
very
broken
but
tolerably
well
timbered
crossing
a
point
of
ridge
which
makes
in
to
the
river
we
fell
upon
it
again
before
sunset
and
encamped
on
the
right
bank
opposite
to
the
encampment
of
three
lodges
of
snake
indians
they
visited
us
during
the
evening
and
we
obtained
from
them
a
small
quantity
of
roots
of
different
kinds
in
exchange
for
goods
among
them
was
a
sweet
root
of
very
pleasant
flavor
having
somewhat
the
taste
of
preserved
quince
my
endeavors
to
become
acquainted
with
the
plants
which
furnish
to
the
indians
a
portion
of
their
support
were
only
gradually
successful
and
after
long
and
persevering
attention
and
even
after
obtaining
i
did
not
succeed
in
preserving
them
until
they
could
be
satisfactorily
determined
in
this
portion
of
the
journey
i
found
this
particular
root
cut
up
into
small
pieces
that
it
was
only
to
be
identified
by
its
taste
when
the
bulb
was
met
with
in
perfect
form
among
the
indians
lower
down
on
the
columbia
among
whom
it
is
the
highly
celebrated
kamas
it
was
long
afterwards
on
our
return
through
upper
california
that
i
found
the
plant
itself
in
bloom
which
i
supposed
to
furnish
the
kamas
root
the
root
diet
had
a
rather
mournful
effect
at
the
commencement
and
one
of
the
calves
was
killed
this
evening
for
food
the
animals
fared
well
on
rushes
the
morning
was
cloudy
with
appearance
of
rain
and
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
at
making
an
unusually
early
start
we
crossed
the
river
at
a
good
ford
and
following
for
about
three
hours
a
trail
which
led
along
the
bottom
we
entered
a
labyrinth
of
hills
below
the
main
ridge
and
halted
to
noon
in
the
ravine
of
a
pretty
little
stream
timbered
with
cottonwood
of
a
large
size
maple
with
cherry
and
other
shrubby
trees
the
hazy
weather
which
had
prevented
any
very
extended
views
since
entering
the
green
river
valley
began
now
to
disappear
there
was
a
slight
rain
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
and
at
noon
when
the
thermometer
had
risen
to
we
had
a
bright
sun
with
blue
sky
and
scattered
according
to
the
barometer
our
halt
there
among
the
hills
was
at
an
elevation
of
feet
crossing
a
dividing
ridge
in
the
afternoon
we
followed
down
another
little
bear
river
tributary
to
the
point
where
it
emerged
on
an
open
green
flat
among
the
hills
timbered
with
groves
and
bordered
with
cane
thickets
but
without
water
a
pretty
little
rivulet
coming
out
of
the
hillside
and
overhung
by
tall
flowering
plants
of
a
species
i
had
not
hitherto
seen
furnished
us
with
a
good
the
evening
was
cloudy
the
temperature
at
sunset
and
the
elevation
feet
among
the
plants
occurring
along
the
road
during
the
day
des
grindelia
squarraso
was
in
considerable
abundance
and
is
among
the
very
few
plants
remaining
in
bloom
the
whole
country
having
now
an
autumnal
appearance
in
the
crisp
and
yellow
plants
and
grasses
many
cranes
were
seen
during
the
day
with
a
few
antelope
very
shy
and
wild
during
the
night
we
had
a
with
moderate
rain
which
has
made
the
air
this
morning
very
clear
the
thermometer
being
at
leaving
our
encampment
at
the
and
quitting
the
trail
on
which
we
had
been
traveling
and
which
would
probably
have
afforded
us
a
good
road
to
the
lake
we
crossed
some
very
deep
ravines
and
in
about
an
hour
traveling
again
reached
the
river
we
were
now
in
a
valley
five
or
six
miles
wide
between
mountain
ranges
which
about
thirty
miles
below
appeared
to
close
up
and
terminate
the
valley
leaving
for
the
river
only
a
very
narrow
pass
or
canon
behind
which
we
imagined
we
would
find
the
broad
waters
of
the
lake
we
made
the
usual
halt
at
the
mouth
of
a
small
clear
stream
having
a
slightly
mineral
taste
perhaps
of
salt
feet
above
the
gulf
in
the
afternoon
we
climbed
a
very
steep
sandy
hill
and
after
a
slow
and
winding
day
march
of
miles
encamped
at
a
slough
on
the
river
there
were
great
quantities
of
geese
and
ducks
of
which
only
a
few
were
shot
the
indians
having
probably
made
them
very
wild
the
men
employed
themselves
in
fishing
but
caught
nothing
a
skunk
which
was
killed
in
the
afternoon
made
a
supper
for
one
of
the
messes
the
river
is
bordered
occasionally
with
fields
of
cane
which
we
regarded
as
an
indication
of
our
approach
to
a
we
had
frequent
showers
of
rain
during
the
night
with
thunder
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
was
with
air
from
the
and
dark
rainy
clouds
moving
on
the
horizon
rain
squalls
and
bright
sunshine
by
intervals
i
rode
ahead
with
basil
to
explore
the
country
and
continuing
about
three
miles
along
the
river
turned
directly
off
on
a
trail
running
towards
three
marked
gaps
in
the
bordering
range
where
the
mountains
appeared
cut
through
their
bases
towards
which
the
river
plain
rose
gradually
putting
our
horses
into
a
gallop
on
some
fresh
tracks
which
showed
very
plainly
in
the
wet
path
we
came
suddenly
upon
a
small
party
of
shoshonee
indians
who
had
fallen
into
the
trail
from
the
north
we
could
only
communicate
by
signs
but
they
made
us
understand
that
the
road
through
the
chain
was
a
very
excellent
one
leading
into
a
broad
valley
which
ran
to
the
southward
we
halted
to
noon
at
what
may
be
called
the
gate
of
the
pass
on
either
side
of
which
were
huge
mountains
of
rock
between
which
stole
a
little
pure
water
stream
with
a
margin
just
sufficiently
large
for
our
passage
from
the
river
the
plain
had
gradually
risen
to
an
altitude
of
feet
and
by
meridian
observation
the
latitude
of
the
entrance
was
in
the
interval
of
our
usual
halt
several
of
us
wandered
along
up
the
stream
to
examine
the
pass
more
at
leisure
within
the
gate
the
rocks
receded
a
little
back
leaving
a
very
narrow
but
most
beautiful
valley
through
which
the
little
stream
wound
its
way
hidden
by
the
different
kinds
of
trees
and
shrubs
aspen
maple
willow
cherry
and
elder
a
fine
verdure
of
smooth
short
grass
spread
over
the
remaining
space
to
the
bare
sides
of
the
rocky
walls
these
were
of
a
blue
limestone
which
constitutes
the
mountain
here
and
opening
directly
on
the
grassy
bottom
were
several
curious
caves
which
appeared
to
be
inhabited
by
on
one
side
was
gathered
a
heap
of
leaves
for
a
bed
and
they
were
dry
open
and
pleasant
on
the
roofs
of
the
caves
i
remarked
bituminous
exudations
from
the
rock
the
trail
was
an
excellent
one
for
but
as
it
sometimes
crossed
a
shelving
point
to
avoid
the
shrubbery
we
were
obliged
in
several
places
to
open
a
road
for
the
carriage
through
the
wood
a
squaw
on
horseback
accompanied
by
five
or
six
dogs
entered
the
pass
in
the
afternoon
but
was
too
much
terrified
at
finding
herself
in
such
unexpected
company
to
make
any
pause
for
conversation
and
hurried
off
at
a
good
pace
being
of
course
no
further
disturbed
than
by
an
accelerating
shout
she
was
well
and
showily
dressed
and
was
probably
going
to
a
village
encamped
somewhere
near
and
evidently
did
not
belong
to
the
tribe
of
we
now
had
entered
a
country
inhabited
by
these
people
and
as
in
the
course
of
the
voyage
we
shall
frequently
meet
with
them
in
various
stages
of
existence
it
will
be
well
to
inform
you
that
scattered
over
the
great
region
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
south
of
the
great
snake
river
are
numerous
indians
whose
subsistence
is
almost
solely
derived
from
roots
and
seeds
and
such
small
animals
as
chance
and
great
good
fortune
sometimes
bring
within
their
reach
they
are
miserably
poor
armed
only
with
bows
and
arrows
or
clubs
and
as
the
country
they
inhabit
is
almost
destitute
of
game
they
have
no
means
of
obtaining
better
arms
in
the
northern
part
of
the
region
just
mentioned
they
live
generally
in
solitary
families
and
farther
to
the
south
they
are
gathered
together
in
villages
those
who
live
together
in
villages
strengthened
by
association
are
in
exclusive
possession
of
the
more
genial
and
richer
parts
of
the
country
while
the
others
are
driven
to
the
ruder
mountains
and
to
the
more
inhospitable
parts
of
the
country
but
by
simply
observing
in
accompanying
us
along
our
road
you
will
become
better
acquainted
with
these
people
than
we
could
make
you
in
any
other
than
a
very
long
description
and
you
will
find
them
worthy
of
your
interest
roots
seeds
and
grass
every
vegetable
that
affords
any
nourishment
and
every
living
animal
thing
insect
or
worm
they
eat
nearly
approaching
to
the
lower
animal
creation
their
sole
employment
is
to
obtain
food
and
they
are
constantly
occupied
in
struggling
to
support
existence
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
the
pass
is
the
which
has
fallen
from
the
cliffs
above
and
standing
perpendicularly
near
the
middle
of
the
valley
presents
itself
like
a
in
the
pass
it
will
give
you
a
tolerably
correct
idea
of
the
character
of
the
scenery
in
this
country
where
generally
the
mountains
rise
abruptly
up
from
comparatively
unbroken
plains
and
level
valleys
but
it
will
entirely
fail
in
representing
the
picturesque
beauty
of
this
delightful
place
where
a
green
valley
full
of
foliage
and
a
hundred
yards
wide
contrasts
with
naked
crags
that
spire
up
into
a
blue
line
of
pinnacles
feet
above
sometimes
crested
with
cedar
and
pine
and
sometimes
ragged
and
bare
the
detention
that
we
met
with
in
opening
the
road
and
perhaps
a
willingness
to
linger
on
the
way
made
the
afternoon
travel
short
and
about
two
miles
from
the
entrance
we
passed
through
another
gate
and
encamped
on
the
stream
at
the
junction
of
a
little
fork
from
the
southward
around
which
the
mountains
stooped
more
gently
down
forming
a
small
open
cove
as
it
was
still
early
in
the
afternoon
basil
and
myself
in
one
direction
and
preuss
in
another
set
out
to
explore
the
country
and
ascended
different
neighboring
peaks
in
the
hope
of
seeing
some
indications
of
the
lake
but
though
our
elevation
afforded
magnificent
views
the
eye
ranging
over
a
large
extent
of
bear
river
with
the
broad
and
fertile
in
the
direction
of
our
search
was
only
to
be
seen
a
bed
of
apparently
impracticable
mountains
among
these
the
trail
we
had
been
following
turned
sharply
to
the
northward
and
it
began
to
be
doubtful
if
it
would
not
lead
us
away
from
the
object
of
our
destination
but
i
nevertheless
determined
to
keep
it
in
the
belief
that
it
would
eventually
bring
us
right
a
squall
of
rain
drove
us
out
of
the
mountain
and
it
was
late
when
we
reached
the
camp
the
evening
closed
in
with
frequent
showers
of
rain
with
some
lightning
and
thunder
we
had
constant
during
the
night
but
in
the
morning
the
clouds
were
sinking
to
the
horizon
and
the
air
was
clear
and
cold
with
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
at
elevation
by
barometer
feet
we
were
in
motion
early
continuing
up
the
little
stream
without
encountering
any
ascent
where
a
horse
would
not
easily
gallop
and
crossing
a
slight
dividing
ground
at
the
summit
descended
upon
a
small
stream
along
which
continued
the
same
excellent
road
in
riding
through
the
pass
numerous
cranes
were
seen
and
prairie
hens
or
grouse
which
lately
had
been
rare
were
very
abundant
this
little
affluent
brought
us
to
a
larger
stream
down
which
we
traveled
through
a
more
open
bottom
on
a
level
road
where
wagons
could
pass
without
obstacle
the
hills
on
the
right
grew
lower
and
on
entering
a
more
open
country
we
discovered
a
shoshonee
village
and
being
desirous
to
obtain
information
and
purchase
from
them
some
roots
and
berries
we
halted
on
the
river
which
was
lightly
wooded
with
cherry
willow
maple
and
aspen
a
meridian
observation
of
the
sun
which
i
obtained
here
gave
for
our
latitude
and
the
barometer
indicated
a
height
of
feet
a
number
of
indians
came
immediately
over
to
visit
us
and
several
men
were
sent
to
the
village
with
goods
tobacco
knives
cloth
vermilion
and
the
usual
trinkets
to
exchange
for
provisions
but
they
had
no
game
of
any
kind
and
it
was
difficult
to
obtain
any
roots
from
them
as
they
were
miserably
poor
and
had
but
little
to
spare
from
their
winter
stock
of
provisions
several
of
the
indians
drew
aside
their
blankets
showing
me
their
lean
and
bony
figures
and
i
would
not
any
longer
tempt
them
with
a
display
of
our
merchandise
to
part
with
their
wretched
subsistence
when
they
gave
as
a
reason
that
it
would
expose
them
to
temporary
starvation
a
great
portion
of
the
region
inhabited
by
this
nation
formerly
abounded
in
game
the
buffalo
ranging
about
in
herds
as
we
had
found
them
on
the
eastern
waters
and
the
plains
dotted
with
scattered
bands
of
antelope
but
so
rapidly
have
they
disappeared
within
a
few
years
that
now
as
we
journeyed
along
an
occasional
buffalo
skull
and
a
few
wild
antelope
were
all
that
remained
of
the
abundance
which
had
covered
the
country
with
animal
life
the
extraordinary
rapidity
with
which
the
buffalo
is
disappearing
from
our
territories
will
not
appear
surprising
when
we
remember
the
great
scale
on
which
their
destruction
is
yearly
carried
on
with
inconsiderable
exceptions
the
business
of
the
american
is
carried
on
in
their
skins
every
year
the
indian
villages
make
new
lodges
for
which
the
skin
of
the
buffalo
furnishes
the
material
and
in
that
portion
of
the
country
where
they
are
still
found
the
indians
derive
their
entire
support
from
them
and
slaughter
them
with
a
thoughtless
and
abominable
extravagance
like
the
indians
themselves
they
have
been
a
characteristic
of
the
great
west
and
as
like
them
they
are
visibly
diminishing
it
will
be
interesting
to
throw
a
glance
backward
through
the
last
twenty
years
and
give
some
account
of
their
former
distribution
through
the
country
and
the
limit
of
their
western
range
the
information
is
derived
principally
from
fitzpatrick
supported
by
my
own
personal
knowledge
and
acquaintance
with
the
country
our
knowledge
does
not
go
farther
back
than
the
spring
of
at
which
time
the
buffalo
were
spread
in
immense
numbers
over
the
green
river
and
bear
river
valleys
and
through
all
the
country
lying
between
the
colorado
or
green
river
of
the
gulf
of
california
and
lewis
fork
of
the
columbia
river
the
meridian
of
fort
hall
then
forming
the
western
limit
of
their
range
the
buffalo
then
remained
for
many
years
in
that
country
and
frequently
moved
down
the
valley
of
the
columbia
on
both
sides
of
the
river
as
far
as
the
below
this
point
they
never
descended
in
any
numbers
about
the
year
or
they
began
to
diminish
very
rapidly
and
continued
to
decrease
until
or
when
with
the
country
we
have
just
described
they
entirely
abandoned
all
the
waters
of
the
pacific
north
of
lewis
fork
of
the
columbia
at
that
time
the
flathead
indians
were
in
the
habit
of
finding
their
buffalo
on
the
heads
of
salmon
river
and
other
streams
of
the
columbia
but
now
they
never
meet
with
them
farther
west
than
the
three
forks
of
the
missouri
or
the
plains
of
the
river
in
the
course
of
our
journey
it
will
be
remarked
that
the
buffalo
have
not
so
entirely
abandoned
the
waters
of
the
pacific
in
the
region
south
of
the
sweet
water
as
in
the
country
north
of
the
great
pass
this
partial
distribution
can
only
be
accounted
for
in
the
great
pastoral
beauty
of
that
country
which
bears
marks
of
having
been
one
of
their
favorite
haunts
and
by
the
fact
that
the
white
hunters
have
more
frequented
the
northern
than
the
southern
region
it
being
north
of
the
south
pass
that
the
hunters
trappers
and
traders
have
had
their
rendezvous
for
many
years
past
and
from
that
section
also
the
greater
portion
of
the
beaver
and
rich
furs
were
taken
although
always
the
most
dangerous
as
well
as
the
most
profitable
in
that
region
lying
between
the
green
or
colorado
river
and
the
of
the
rio
del
norte
over
the
kooyah
and
rivers
all
of
which
are
the
waters
of
the
colorado
the
buffalo
never
extended
so
far
to
the
westward
as
they
did
on
the
waters
of
the
columbia
and
only
in
one
or
two
instances
have
they
been
known
to
descend
as
far
west
as
the
mouth
of
white
river
in
traveling
through
the
country
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
observation
readily
led
me
to
the
impression
that
the
buffalo
had
for
the
first
time
crossed
that
range
to
the
waters
of
the
pacific
only
a
few
years
prior
to
the
period
we
are
considering
and
in
this
opinion
i
am
sustained
by
fitzpatrick
and
the
older
trappers
in
that
country
in
the
region
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
we
never
meet
with
any
of
the
ancient
vestiges
which
throughout
all
the
country
lying
upon
their
eastern
waters
are
found
in
the
continuous
for
hundreds
of
miles
always
several
inches
and
sometimes
several
feet
in
depth
which
the
buffalo
have
made
in
crossing
from
one
river
to
another
or
in
traversing
the
mountain
ranges
the
snake
indians
more
particularly
those
low
down
upon
lewis
fork
have
always
been
very
grateful
to
the
american
trappers
for
the
great
kindness
as
they
frequently
expressed
it
which
they
did
to
them
in
driving
the
buffalo
so
low
down
the
columbia
river
the
extraordinary
abundance
of
the
buffalo
on
the
east
side
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
their
extraordinary
diminution
will
be
made
clearly
evident
from
the
following
statement
at
any
time
between
the
years
and
a
traveler
might
start
from
any
given
point
south
or
north
in
the
rocky
mountain
range
journeying
by
the
most
direct
route
to
the
missouri
river
and
during
the
whole
distance
his
road
would
always
be
among
large
bands
of
buffalo
which
would
never
be
out
of
his
view
until
he
arrived
almost
within
sight
of
the
abodes
of
civilization
at
this
time
the
buffalo
occupy
but
a
very
limited
space
principally
along
the
eastern
base
of
the
rocky
mountains
sometimes
extending
at
their
southern
extremity
to
a
considerable
distance
into
the
plains
between
the
platte
and
arkansas
rivers
and
along
the
eastern
frontier
of
new
mexico
as
far
south
as
texas
the
following
statement
which
i
owe
to
the
kindness
of
sanford
a
partner
in
the
american
fur
company
will
further
illustrate
this
subject
by
extensive
knowledge
acquired
during
several
years
of
travel
through
the
region
inhabited
by
the
buffalo
the
total
amount
of
robes
annually
traded
by
ourselves
and
others
will
not
be
found
to
differ
much
from
the
following
statement
robes
american
fur
company
hudson
bay
company
all
other
companies
probably
making
a
total
of
as
an
average
annual
return
for
the
last
eight
or
ten
years
in
the
northwest
the
hudson
bay
company
purchase
from
the
indians
but
a
very
small
number
their
only
market
being
canada
to
which
the
cost
of
transportation
nearly
equals
the
produce
of
the
furs
and
it
is
only
within
a
very
recent
period
that
they
have
received
buffalo
robes
in
trade
and
out
of
the
great
number
of
buffalo
annually
killed
throughout
the
extensive
region
inhabited
by
the
camanches
and
other
kindred
tribes
no
robes
whatever
are
furnished
for
trade
during
only
four
months
of
the
year
from
november
until
march
the
skins
are
good
for
dressing
those
obtained
in
the
remaining
eight
months
are
valueless
to
traders
and
the
hides
of
bulls
are
never
taken
off
or
dressed
as
robes
at
any
season
probably
not
more
than
of
the
skins
are
taken
from
the
animals
killed
even
when
they
are
in
good
season
the
labor
of
preparing
and
dressing
the
robes
being
very
great
and
it
is
seldom
that
a
lodge
trades
more
than
twenty
skins
in
a
year
it
is
during
the
summer
months
and
in
the
early
part
of
autumn
that
the
greatest
number
of
buffalo
are
killed
and
yet
at
this
time
a
skin
is
never
taken
for
the
purpose
of
trade
from
these
data
which
are
certainly
limited
and
decidedly
within
bounds
the
reader
is
left
to
draw
his
own
inference
of
the
immense
number
annually
killed
in
i
found
the
sioux
indians
of
the
upper
platte
as
their
french
traders
expressed
it
with
the
failure
of
the
buffalo
and
in
the
following
year
large
villages
from
the
upper
missouri
came
over
to
the
mountains
at
the
heads
of
the
platte
in
search
of
them
the
rapidly
progressive
failure
of
their
principal
and
almost
their
only
means
of
subsistence
has
created
great
alarm
among
them
and
at
this
time
there
are
only
two
modes
presented
to
them
by
which
they
see
a
good
prospect
for
escaping
starvation
one
of
these
is
to
rob
the
settlements
along
the
frontier
of
the
states
and
the
other
is
to
form
a
league
between
the
various
tribes
of
the
sioux
nation
the
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
and
make
war
against
the
crow
nation
in
order
to
take
from
them
their
country
which
is
now
the
best
buffalo
country
in
the
west
this
plan
they
now
have
in
consideration
and
it
would
probably
be
a
war
of
extermination
as
the
crows
have
long
been
advised
of
this
state
of
affairs
and
say
that
they
are
perfectly
prepared
these
are
the
best
warriors
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
are
now
allied
with
the
snake
indians
and
it
is
probable
that
their
combination
would
extend
itself
to
the
utahs
who
have
long
been
engaged
in
war
against
the
sioux
it
is
in
this
section
of
country
that
my
observation
formerly
led
me
to
recommend
the
establishment
of
a
military
post
the
farther
course
of
our
narrative
will
give
fuller
and
more
detailed
information
of
the
present
disposition
of
the
buffalo
in
the
country
we
visited
among
the
roots
we
obtained
here
i
could
distinguish
only
five
or
six
different
kinds
and
the
supply
of
the
indians
whom
we
met
consisted
principally
of
yampah
and
a
large
root
of
a
species
of
thistle
which
now
is
occasionally
abundant
and
is
a
very
agreeably
flavored
vegetable
we
had
been
detained
so
long
at
the
village
that
in
the
afternoon
we
made
only
five
miles
and
encamped
on
the
same
river
after
a
journey
of
miles
the
indians
informed
us
that
we
should
reach
the
big
salt
water
after
having
slept
twice
and
traveling
in
a
south
direction
the
stream
had
here
entered
nearly
a
level
plain
or
valley
of
good
soil
eight
or
ten
miles
broad
to
which
no
termination
was
to
be
seen
and
lying
between
ranges
of
mountains
which
on
the
right
were
grassy
and
smooth
unbroken
by
rock
and
lower
than
on
the
left
where
they
were
rocky
and
bald
increasing
in
height
to
the
southward
on
the
creek
were
fringes
of
young
willows
older
trees
being
rarely
found
on
the
plains
where
the
indians
burn
the
surface
to
produce
better
grass
several
magpies
were
seen
on
the
creek
this
afternoon
and
a
rattlesnake
was
killed
here
the
first
which
had
been
seen
since
leaving
the
eastern
plains
our
camp
had
such
a
hungry
appearance
that
i
suffered
the
little
cow
to
be
killed
and
divided
the
roots
and
berries
among
the
people
a
number
of
indians
from
the
village
encamped
near
the
weather
the
next
morning
was
clear
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
at
and
continuing
down
the
valley
in
about
five
miles
we
followed
the
little
creek
of
our
encampment
to
its
junction
with
a
larger
stream
called
or
reed
river
immediately
opposite
on
the
right
the
range
was
gathered
into
its
highest
peak
sloping
gradually
low
and
running
off
to
a
point
apparently
some
forty
or
fifty
miles
below
between
this
now
become
the
valley
stream
and
the
foot
of
the
mountains
we
journeyed
along
a
handsome
sloping
level
which
frequent
springs
from
the
hills
made
occasionally
miry
and
halted
to
noon
at
a
swampy
spring
where
there
were
good
grass
and
abundant
rushes
here
the
river
was
forty
feet
wide
with
a
considerable
current
and
the
valley
a
mile
and
a
half
in
breadth
the
soil
being
generally
good
of
a
dark
color
and
apparently
well
adapted
to
cultivation
the
day
had
become
bright
and
pleasant
with
the
thermometer
at
by
observation
our
latitude
was
and
the
elevation
above
the
sea
feet
on
our
left
this
afternoon
the
range
at
long
intervals
formed
itself
into
peaks
appearing
to
terminate
about
forty
miles
below
in
a
rocky
cape
beyond
which
several
others
were
faintly
visible
and
we
were
disappointed
when
at
every
little
rise
we
did
not
see
the
lake
towards
evening
our
way
was
somewhat
obstructed
by
fields
of
which
began
to
make
their
appearance
here
and
we
encamped
on
the
roseaux
the
water
of
which
had
acquired
a
decidedly
salt
taste
nearly
opposite
to
a
canon
gap
in
the
mountains
through
which
the
bear
river
enters
this
valley
as
we
encamped
the
night
set
in
dark
and
cold
with
heavy
rain
and
the
artemisia
which
was
our
only
wood
was
so
wet
that
it
would
not
burn
a
poor
nearly
starved
dog
with
a
wound
in
his
side
from
a
ball
came
to
the
camp
and
remained
with
us
until
the
winter
when
he
met
a
very
unexpected
fate
september
the
morning
was
squally
and
cold
the
sky
scattered
over
with
clouds
and
the
night
had
been
so
uncomfortable
that
we
were
not
on
the
road
until
eight
traveling
between
roseaux
and
bear
rivers
we
continued
to
descend
the
valley
which
gradually
expanded
as
we
advanced
into
a
level
plain
of
good
soil
about
miles
in
breadth
between
mountains
and
feet
high
rising
suddenly
to
the
clouds
which
all
day
rested
upon
the
peaks
these
gleamed
out
in
the
occasional
sunlight
mantled
with
the
snow
which
had
fallen
upon
them
while
it
rained
on
us
in
the
valley
below
of
which
the
elevation
here
was
feet
above
the
sea
the
country
before
us
plainly
indicated
that
we
were
approaching
the
lake
though
as
the
ground
we
were
traveling
afforded
no
elevated
point
nothing
of
it
as
yet
could
be
seen
and
at
a
great
distance
ahead
were
several
isolated
mountains
resembling
islands
which
they
were
afterwards
found
to
be
on
this
upper
plain
the
grass
was
everywhere
dead
and
among
the
shrubs
with
which
it
was
almost
exclusively
occupied
artemisia
being
the
most
abundant
frequently
occurred
handsome
clusters
of
several
species
of
in
bloom
was
among
the
frequent
shrubs
descending
to
the
bottoms
of
bear
river
we
found
good
grass
for
the
animals
and
encamped
about
yards
above
the
mouth
of
roseaux
which
here
makes
its
junction
without
communicating
any
of
its
salty
taste
to
the
main
stream
of
which
the
water
remains
perfectly
pure
on
the
river
are
only
willow
thickets
and
in
the
bottoms
the
abundant
plants
are
canes
soldiago
and
helianthi
and
along
the
banks
of
roseaux
are
fields
of
at
sunset
the
thermometer
was
at
and
the
evening
clear
and
calm
but
i
deferred
making
any
use
of
it
until
one
in
the
morning
when
i
endeavored
to
obtain
an
emersion
of
the
first
satellite
but
it
was
lost
in
a
bank
of
clouds
which
also
rendered
our
usual
observations
indifferent
among
the
useful
things
which
formed
a
portion
of
our
equipage
was
an
boat
feet
long
made
somewhat
in
the
form
of
a
bark
canoe
of
the
northern
lakes
the
sides
were
formed
by
two
cylinders
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
connected
with
others
forming
the
bow
and
stern
to
lessen
the
danger
from
accidents
to
the
boat
these
were
divided
into
four
different
compartments
and
the
interior
space
was
sufficiently
large
to
contain
five
or
six
persons
and
a
considerable
weight
of
baggage
the
roseaux
being
too
deep
to
be
forded
our
boat
was
filled
with
air
and
in
about
one
hour
all
the
equipage
of
the
camp
carriage
and
gun
included
ferried
across
thinking
that
perhaps
in
the
course
of
the
day
we
might
reach
the
outlet
of
the
lake
i
got
into
the
boat
with
basil
lajeunesse
and
paddled
down
bear
river
intending
at
night
to
rejoin
the
party
which
in
the
mean
time
proceeded
on
its
way
the
river
was
from
sixty
to
one
hundred
yards
broad
and
the
water
so
deep
that
even
on
the
comparatively
shallow
points
we
could
not
reach
the
bottom
with
feet
on
either
side
were
alternately
low
bottoms
and
willow
points
with
an
occasional
high
prairie
and
for
five
or
six
hours
we
followed
slowly
the
winding
course
of
the
river
which
crept
along
with
a
sluggish
current
among
frequent
several
miles
around
sometimes
running
for
a
considerable
distance
directly
up
the
valley
as
we
were
stealing
quietly
down
the
stream
trying
in
vain
to
get
a
shot
at
a
strange
large
bird
that
was
numerous
among
the
willows
but
very
shy
we
came
unexpectedly
upon
several
families
of
who
were
encamped
among
the
rushes
on
the
shore
and
appeared
very
busy
about
several
weirs
or
nets
which
had
been
rudely
made
of
canes
and
rushes
for
the
purpose
of
catching
fish
they
were
very
much
startled
at
our
appearance
but
we
soon
established
an
acquaintance
and
finding
that
they
had
some
roots
i
promised
to
send
some
men
with
goods
to
trade
with
them
they
had
the
usual
very
large
heads
remarkable
among
the
digger
tribe
with
matted
hair
and
were
almost
entirely
naked
looking
very
poor
and
miserable
as
if
their
lives
had
been
spent
in
the
rushes
where
they
were
beyond
which
they
seemed
to
have
very
little
knowledge
of
any
thing
from
the
words
we
could
comprehend
their
language
was
that
of
the
snake
indians
our
boat
moved
so
heavily
that
we
had
made
very
little
progress
and
finding
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
overtake
the
camp
as
soon
as
we
were
sufficiently
far
below
the
indians
we
put
to
the
shore
near
a
high
prairie
bank
hauled
up
the
boat
and
our
effects
in
the
willows
ascending
the
bank
we
found
that
our
desultory
labor
had
brought
us
only
a
few
miles
in
a
direct
line
and
going
out
into
the
prairie
after
a
search
we
found
the
trail
of
the
camp
which
was
nowhere
in
sight
but
had
followed
the
general
course
of
the
river
in
a
large
circular
sweep
which
it
makes
at
this
place
the
sun
was
about
three
hours
high
when
we
found
the
trail
and
as
our
people
had
passed
early
in
the
day
we
had
the
prospect
of
a
vigorous
walk
before
us
immediately
where
we
landed
the
high
arable
plain
on
which
we
had
been
traveling
for
several
days
past
terminated
in
extensive
low
flats
very
generally
occupied
by
salt
marshes
or
beds
of
shallow
lakes
whence
the
water
had
in
most
places
evaporated
leaving
their
hard
surface
incrusted
with
a
shining
white
residuum
and
absolutely
covered
with
very
small
shells
as
we
advanced
the
whole
country
around
us
assumed
this
appearance
and
there
was
no
other
vegetation
than
the
shrubby
chenopodiaceous
and
other
apparently
saline
plants
which
were
confined
to
the
rising
grounds
here
and
there
on
the
river
bank
which
was
raised
like
a
levee
above
the
flats
through
which
it
ran
was
a
narrow
border
of
grass
and
short
willows
the
stream
being
very
deep
and
sluggish
and
sometimes
six
hundred
to
eight
hundred
feet
wide
after
a
rapid
walk
of
about
fifteen
miles
we
caught
sight
of
the
among
clumps
of
willows
just
as
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
mountains
on
the
west
side
of
the
valley
filling
the
clear
sky
with
a
golden
yellow
these
last
rays
to
us
so
precious
could
not
have
revealed
a
more
welcome
sight
to
the
traveler
and
the
hunter
a
in
the
lonely
wilderness
is
always
cheering
and
to
ourselves
in
our
present
situation
after
a
hard
march
in
a
region
of
novelty
approaching
the
of
a
river
in
a
lake
of
almost
fabulous
reputation
it
was
doubly
so
a
plentiful
supper
of
aquatic
birds
and
the
interest
of
the
scene
soon
dissipated
fatigue
and
i
obtained
during
the
night
emersions
of
the
second
third
and
fourth
satellites
of
jupiter
with
observations
for
time
and
latitude
the
morning
was
clear
with
a
light
air
from
the
north
and
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
at
at
three
in
the
morning
basil
was
sent
back
with
several
men
and
horses
for
the
boat
which
in
a
direct
course
across
the
flats
was
not
ten
miles
distant
and
in
the
mean
time
there
was
a
pretty
spot
of
grass
here
for
the
animals
the
ground
was
so
low
that
we
could
not
get
high
enough
to
see
across
the
river
on
account
of
the
willows
but
we
were
evidently
in
the
vicinity
of
the
lake
and
the
made
this
morning
a
noise
like
thunder
a
pelican
was
killed
as
he
passed
by
and
many
geese
and
ducks
flew
over
the
camp
on
the
dry
salt
marsh
here
is
scarce
any
other
plant
than
in
the
afternoon
the
men
returned
with
the
boat
bringing
with
them
a
small
quantity
of
roots
and
some
meat
which
the
indians
had
told
them
was
descending
the
river
for
about
three
miles
in
the
afternoon
we
found
a
bar
to
any
further
traveling
in
that
direction
the
stream
being
spread
out
in
several
branches
and
covering
the
low
grounds
with
water
where
the
miry
nature
of
the
bottom
did
not
permit
any
further
advance
we
were
evidently
on
the
border
of
the
lake
although
the
rushes
and
canes
which
covered
the
marshes
prevented
any
view
and
we
accordingly
encamped
at
the
little
which
forms
the
mouth
of
bear
river
a
long
arm
of
the
lake
stretching
up
to
the
north
between
us
and
the
opposite
mountains
the
river
was
bordered
with
a
fringe
of
willows
and
canes
among
which
were
interspersed
a
few
plants
and
scattered
about
on
the
marsh
was
a
species
of
closely
allied
to
of
our
the
whole
morass
was
animated
with
multitudes
of
which
appeared
to
be
very
wild
rising
for
the
space
of
a
mile
round
about
at
the
sound
of
a
gun
with
a
noise
like
distant
thunder
several
of
the
people
waded
out
into
the
marshes
and
we
had
a
delicious
supper
of
ducks
geese
and
plover
although
the
moon
was
bright
the
night
was
otherwise
favorable
and
i
obtained
this
evening
an
emersion
of
the
first
satellite
with
the
usual
observations
a
mean
result
depending
on
various
observations
made
during
our
stay
in
the
neighborhood
places
the
mouth
of
the
river
in
longitude
west
from
greenwich
latitude
and
according
to
the
barometer
in
elevation
feet
above
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
night
was
clear
with
considerable
dew
which
i
had
remarked
every
night
since
the
first
of
september
the
next
morning
while
we
were
preparing
to
start
carson
rode
into
the
camp
with
flour
and
a
few
other
articles
of
light
provision
sufficient
for
two
or
three
days
a
scanty
but
very
acceptable
supply
fitzpatrick
had
not
yet
arrived
and
provisions
were
very
scarce
and
difficult
to
be
had
at
fort
hall
which
had
been
entirely
exhausted
by
the
necessities
of
the
emigrants
he
brought
me
also
a
letter
from
dwight
who
in
company
with
several
emigrants
had
reached
that
place
in
advance
of
fitzpatrick
and
was
about
continuing
his
journey
to
vancouver
returning
about
five
miles
up
the
river
we
were
occupied
until
nearly
sunset
in
crossing
to
the
left
bank
the
stream
which
in
the
last
five
or
six
miles
of
its
course
is
very
much
narrower
than
above
being
very
deep
immediately
at
the
banks
and
we
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
our
animals
over
the
people
with
the
baggage
were
easily
crossed
in
the
boat
and
we
encamped
on
the
left
bank
where
we
crossed
the
river
at
sunset
the
thermometer
was
at
and
there
was
some
rain
during
the
night
with
a
at
a
distance
before
us
was
evidently
the
bed
of
the
lake
being
a
great
salt
marsh
perfectly
level
and
bare
whitened
in
places
by
saline
efflorescences
with
here
and
there
a
pool
of
water
and
having
the
appearance
of
a
very
level
seashore
at
low
tide
immediately
along
the
river
was
a
very
narrow
strip
of
vegetation
consisting
of
willows
helianthi
roses
flowering
vines
and
grass
bordered
on
the
verge
of
the
great
marsh
by
a
fringe
of
singular
plants
which
appear
to
be
a
shrubby
salicornia
or
a
genus
allied
to
it
about
miles
to
the
southward
was
one
of
those
isolated
mountains
now
appearing
to
be
a
kind
of
peninsula
and
towards
this
we
accordingly
directed
our
course
as
it
probably
afforded
a
good
view
of
the
lake
but
the
deepening
mud
as
we
advanced
forced
us
to
return
towards
the
river
and
gain
the
higher
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
eastern
mountains
here
we
halted
for
a
few
minutes
at
noon
on
a
beautiful
little
stream
of
pure
and
remarkably
clear
water
with
a
bed
of
rock
on
which
was
an
abundant
with
a
white
blossom
there
was
good
grass
in
the
bottoms
and
amidst
a
rather
luxuriant
growth
its
banks
were
bordered
with
a
large
showy
plant
which
i
here
saw
for
the
first
time
we
named
the
stream
we
continued
our
way
along
the
mountain
having
found
here
a
broad
trail
over
what
was
apparently
the
shore
of
the
lake
in
the
spring
the
ground
being
high
and
firm
and
the
soil
excellent
and
covered
with
vegetation
among
which
a
leguminous
plant
was
a
characteristic
plant
the
ridge
here
rises
abruptly
to
the
height
of
about
feet
its
face
being
very
prominently
marked
with
a
massive
stratum
of
granular
quartz
which
is
evidently
an
altered
sedimentary
rock
the
lines
of
deposition
being
very
distinct
it
is
rocky
and
steep
divided
into
several
mountains
and
the
rain
in
the
valley
appears
to
be
always
snow
on
their
summits
at
this
season
near
a
remarkably
rocky
point
of
the
mountain
at
a
large
spring
of
pure
water
were
several
probably
a
new
species
the
berries
still
green
and
a
short
distance
farther
thickets
of
sumach
on
the
plain
here
i
noticed
blackbirds
and
grouse
in
about
seven
miles
from
clear
creek
the
trail
brought
us
to
a
place
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
where
there
issued
with
considerable
force
or
hot
springs
highly
impregnated
with
salt
in
one
of
these
the
thermometer
stood
at
and
in
another
at
and
the
water
which
was
spread
in
pools
over
the
low
ground
was
colored
red
an
analysis
of
the
red
earthy
matter
deposited
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
from
the
springs
gives
the
following
result
peroxide
of
iron
carbonate
of
magnesia
carbonate
of
lime
sulphate
of
lime
chloride
of
sodium
silica
and
alumina
water
and
loss
at
this
place
the
trail
we
had
been
following
turned
to
the
left
apparently
with
a
view
of
entering
a
gorge
in
the
mountain
from
which
issued
the
principal
fork
of
a
large
and
comparatively
stream
called
weber
fork
we
accordingly
turned
off
towards
the
lake
and
encamped
on
this
river
which
was
to
feet
wide
with
high
banks
and
very
clear
pure
water
without
the
slightest
indication
of
salt
leaving
the
encampment
early
we
again
directed
our
course
for
the
peninsular
across
a
low
shrubby
plain
crossing
in
the
way
a
creek
with
miry
banks
and
wooded
with
thickets
of
thorn
which
were
loaded
with
berries
this
time
we
reached
the
butte
without
any
difficulty
and
ascending
to
the
summit
immediately
at
our
feet
beheld
the
object
of
our
anxious
search
the
waters
of
the
inland
sea
stretching
in
still
and
solitary
grandeur
far
beyond
the
limit
of
our
vision
it
was
one
of
the
great
points
of
the
exploration
and
as
we
looked
eagerly
over
the
lake
in
the
first
emotions
of
excited
pleasure
i
am
doubtful
if
the
followers
of
balboa
felt
more
enthusiasm
when
from
the
heights
of
the
andes
they
saw
for
the
first
time
the
great
western
ocean
it
was
certainly
a
magnificent
object
and
a
noble
to
this
part
of
our
expedition
and
to
travelers
so
long
shut
up
among
mountain
ranges
a
sudden
view
over
the
expanse
of
silent
waters
had
in
it
something
sublime
several
large
islands
raised
their
high
rocky
heads
out
of
the
waves
but
whether
or
not
they
were
timbered
was
still
left
to
our
imagination
as
the
distance
was
too
great
to
determine
if
the
dark
hues
upon
them
were
woodland
or
naked
rock
during
the
day
the
clouds
had
been
gathering
black
over
the
mountains
to
the
westward
and
while
we
were
looking
a
storm
burst
down
with
sudden
fury
upon
the
lake
and
entirely
hid
the
inlands
from
our
view
so
far
as
we
could
see
along
the
shores
there
was
not
a
solitary
tree
and
but
little
appearance
of
grass
and
on
weber
fork
a
few
miles
below
our
last
encampment
the
timber
was
gathered
into
groves
and
then
disappeared
entirely
as
this
appeared
to
be
the
nearest
point
to
the
lake
where
a
suitable
camp
could
be
found
we
directed
our
course
to
one
of
the
groves
where
we
found
a
handsome
encampment
with
good
grass
and
an
abundance
of
rushes
at
sunset
the
thermometer
was
at
the
evening
clear
and
calm
with
some
cumuli
the
morning
was
calm
and
clear
with
a
temperature
at
sunrise
of
the
day
was
spent
in
active
preparation
for
our
intended
voyage
on
the
lake
on
the
edge
of
the
stream
a
favorable
spot
was
selected
in
a
grove
and
felling
the
timber
we
made
a
strong
or
for
the
animals
and
a
little
fort
for
the
people
who
were
to
remain
we
were
now
probably
in
the
country
of
the
utah
indians
though
none
reside
on
the
lake
the
boat
was
repaired
with
prepared
cloth
and
gum
and
filled
with
air
in
readiness
for
the
next
day
the
provisions
which
carson
brought
with
him
being
now
exhausted
and
our
stock
reduced
to
a
small
quantity
of
roots
i
determined
to
retain
with
me
only
a
sufficient
number
of
men
for
the
execution
of
our
design
and
accordingly
seven
were
sent
back
to
fort
hall
under
the
guidance
of
françois
lajeunesse
who
having
been
for
many
years
a
trapper
in
the
country
was
considered
an
experienced
mountaineer
though
they
were
provided
with
good
horses
and
the
road
was
a
remarkably
plain
one
of
only
four
days
journey
for
a
they
became
bewildered
as
we
afterwards
learned
and
losing
their
way
wandered
about
the
country
in
parties
of
one
or
two
reaching
the
fort
about
a
week
afterwards
some
straggled
in
of
themselves
and
the
others
were
brought
in
by
indians
who
had
picked
them
up
on
snake
river
about
sixty
miles
below
the
fort
traveling
along
the
emigrant
road
in
full
march
for
the
lower
columbia
the
leader
of
this
adventurous
party
was
françois
hourly
barometrical
observations
were
made
during
the
day
and
after
the
departure
of
the
party
for
fort
hall
we
occupied
ourselves
in
continuing
our
little
preparations
and
in
becoming
acquainted
with
the
country
in
the
vicinity
the
bottoms
along
the
river
were
timbered
with
several
kinds
of
willow
hawthorn
and
fine
with
remarkably
large
leaves
and
sixty
feet
in
height
by
measurement
we
formed
now
but
a
small
family
with
preuss
and
myself
carson
bernier
and
basil
lajeunesse
had
been
selected
for
the
boat
expedition
the
first
attempted
on
this
interior
sea
and
badeau
with
derosier
and
jacob
the
colored
man
were
to
be
left
in
charge
of
the
camp
we
were
favored
with
most
delightful
weather
there
was
a
brilliant
sunset
of
golden
orange
and
green
which
left
the
western
sky
clear
and
beautifully
pure
but
clouds
in
the
east
made
me
lose
an
occultation
the
summer
frogs
were
singing
around
us
and
the
evening
was
very
pleasant
with
a
temperature
of
a
night
of
a
more
southern
autumn
for
our
supper
we
had
the
most
agreeably
flavored
of
the
roots
seasoned
by
a
small
fat
duck
which
had
come
in
the
way
of
jacob
rifle
around
our
fire
were
many
speculations
on
what
would
bring
forth
and
in
our
busy
conjectures
we
fancied
that
we
should
find
every
one
of
the
large
islands
a
tangled
wilderness
of
trees
and
shrubbery
teeming
with
game
of
every
description
that
the
neighboring
region
afforded
and
which
the
foot
of
a
white
man
or
indian
had
never
violated
frequently
during
the
day
clouds
had
rested
on
the
summits
of
their
lofty
mountains
and
we
believed
that
we
should
find
clear
streams
and
springs
of
fresh
water
and
we
indulged
in
anticipations
of
the
luxurious
repasts
with
which
we
were
to
indemnify
ourselves
for
past
privations
neither
in
our
discussions
were
the
whirlpool
and
other
mysterious
dangers
forgotten
which
indian
and
hunters
stories
attributed
to
this
unexplored
lake
the
men
had
found
that
instead
of
being
strongly
sewed
like
that
of
the
preceding
year
which
had
so
triumphantly
rode
the
canons
of
the
upper
great
platte
our
present
boat
was
only
pasted
together
in
a
very
insecure
manner
the
maker
having
been
allowed
so
little
time
in
the
construction
that
he
was
obliged
to
crowd
the
labor
of
two
months
into
several
days
the
insecurity
of
the
boat
was
sensibly
felt
by
us
and
mingled
with
the
enthusiasm
and
excitement
that
we
all
felt
at
the
prospect
of
an
undertaking
which
had
never
before
been
accomplished
was
a
certain
impression
of
danger
sufficient
to
give
a
serious
character
to
our
conversation
the
momentary
view
which
had
been
had
of
the
lake
the
day
before
its
great
extent
and
rugged
islands
dimly
seen
amidst
the
dark
waters
in
the
obscurity
of
the
sudden
storm
were
calculated
to
heighten
the
idea
of
undefined
danger
with
which
the
lake
was
generally
associated
a
calm
clear
day
with
a
sunrise
temperature
of
in
view
of
our
present
enterprise
a
part
of
the
equipment
of
the
boat
had
been
made
to
consist
in
three
bags
about
three
feet
long
and
capable
each
of
containing
five
gallons
these
had
been
filled
with
water
the
night
before
and
were
now
placed
in
the
boat
with
our
blankets
and
instruments
consisting
of
a
sextant
telescope
thermometer
and
barometer
we
left
the
camp
at
sunrise
and
had
a
very
pleasant
voyage
down
the
river
in
which
there
was
generally
eight
or
ten
feet
of
water
deepening
as
we
neared
the
mouth
in
the
latter
part
of
the
day
in
the
course
of
the
morning
we
discovered
that
two
of
the
cylinders
leaked
so
much
as
to
require
one
man
constantly
at
the
bellows
to
keep
them
sufficiently
full
of
air
to
support
the
boat
although
we
had
made
a
very
early
start
we
loitered
so
much
on
the
way
stopping
every
now
and
then
and
floating
silently
along
to
get
a
shot
at
a
goose
or
duck
that
it
was
late
in
the
day
when
we
reached
the
outlet
the
river
here
divided
into
several
branches
filled
with
fluvials
and
so
very
shallow
that
it
was
with
difficulty
we
could
get
the
boat
along
being
obliged
to
get
out
and
wade
we
encamped
on
a
low
point
among
rushes
and
young
willows
where
was
a
quantity
of
which
served
for
our
fires
the
evening
was
mild
and
clear
we
made
a
pleasant
bed
of
young
willows
and
geese
and
ducks
enough
had
been
killed
for
an
abundant
supper
at
night
and
for
breakfast
the
next
morning
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
enlivened
by
millions
of
lat
by
observation
and
long
the
day
was
clear
and
calm
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
at
as
is
usual
with
the
trappers
on
the
eve
of
any
enterprise
our
people
had
made
dreams
and
theirs
happened
to
be
a
bad
one
one
which
always
preceded
evil
and
consequently
they
looked
very
gloomy
this
morning
but
we
hurried
through
our
breakfast
in
order
to
made
an
early
start
and
have
all
the
day
before
us
for
our
adventure
the
channel
in
a
short
distance
became
so
shallow
that
our
navigation
was
at
an
end
being
merely
a
sheet
of
soft
mud
with
a
few
inches
of
water
and
sometimes
none
at
all
forming
the
shore
of
the
lake
all
this
place
was
absolutely
covered
with
flocks
of
screaming
plover
we
took
off
our
clothes
and
getting
overboard
commenced
dragging
the
boat
making
by
this
operation
a
very
curious
trail
and
a
very
disagreeable
smell
in
stirring
up
the
mud
as
we
sank
above
the
knee
at
every
step
the
water
here
was
still
fresh
with
only
an
insipid
and
disagreeable
taste
probably
derived
from
the
bed
of
fetid
mud
after
proceeding
in
this
way
about
a
mile
we
came
to
a
small
black
ridge
on
the
bottom
beyond
which
the
water
became
suddenly
salt
beginning
gradually
to
deepen
and
the
bottom
was
sandy
and
firm
it
was
a
remarkable
division
separating
the
fresh
waters
of
the
rivers
from
the
briny
water
of
the
lake
which
was
entirely
with
common
salt
pushing
our
little
vessel
across
the
narrow
boundary
we
sprang
on
board
and
at
length
were
afloat
on
the
waters
of
the
unknown
sea
we
did
not
steer
for
the
mountainous
islands
but
directed
our
course
towards
a
lower
one
which
it
had
been
decided
we
should
first
visit
the
summit
of
which
was
formed
like
the
crater
at
the
upper
end
of
bear
river
valley
so
long
as
we
could
touch
the
bottom
with
our
paddles
we
were
very
gay
but
gradually
as
the
water
deepened
we
became
more
still
in
our
frail
batteau
of
distended
with
air
and
with
pasted
seams
although
the
day
was
very
calm
there
was
a
considerable
swell
on
the
lake
and
there
were
white
patches
of
foam
on
the
surface
which
were
slowly
moving
to
the
southward
indicating
the
set
of
a
current
in
that
direction
and
recalling
the
recollection
of
the
whirlpool
stories
the
water
continued
to
deepen
as
we
advanced
the
lake
becoming
almost
transparently
clear
of
an
extremely
beautiful
color
and
the
spray
which
was
thrown
into
the
boat
and
over
our
clothes
was
directly
converted
into
a
crust
of
common
salt
which
covered
also
our
hands
and
arms
captain
said
carson
who
for
some
time
had
been
looking
suspiciously
at
some
whitening
appearances
outside
the
nearest
islands
what
are
those
yonder
wo
you
just
take
a
look
with
the
glass
we
ceased
paddling
for
a
moment
and
found
them
to
be
the
caps
of
the
waves
that
were
beginning
to
break
under
the
force
of
a
strong
breeze
that
was
coming
up
the
lake
the
form
of
the
boat
seemed
to
be
an
admirable
one
and
it
rode
on
the
waves
like
a
but
at
the
same
time
it
was
extremely
slow
in
its
progress
when
we
were
a
little
more
than
half
way
across
the
reach
two
of
the
divisions
between
the
cylinders
gave
way
and
it
required
the
constant
use
of
the
bellows
to
keep
in
a
sufficient
quantity
of
air
for
a
long
time
we
scarcely
seemed
to
approach
our
island
but
gradually
we
worked
across
the
rougher
sea
of
the
open
channel
into
the
smoother
water
under
the
lee
of
the
island
and
began
to
discover
that
what
we
took
for
a
long
row
of
pelicans
ranged
on
the
beach
were
only
low
cliffs
whitened
with
salt
by
the
spray
of
the
waves
and
about
noon
we
reached
the
shore
the
transparency
of
the
water
enabling
us
to
see
the
bottom
at
a
considerable
depth
it
was
a
handsome
broad
beach
where
we
landed
behind
which
the
hill
into
which
the
island
was
gathered
rose
somewhat
abruptly
and
a
point
of
rock
at
one
end
enclosed
it
in
a
sheltering
way
and
as
there
was
an
abundance
of
along
the
shore
it
offered
us
a
pleasant
encampment
we
did
not
suffer
our
frail
boat
to
touch
the
sharp
rocks
but
getting
overboard
discharged
the
baggage
and
lifting
it
gently
out
of
the
water
carried
it
to
the
upper
part
of
the
beach
which
was
composed
of
very
small
fragments
of
rock
among
the
successive
banks
of
the
beach
formed
by
the
action
of
the
waves
our
attention
as
we
approached
the
island
had
been
attracted
by
one
to
feet
in
breadth
of
a
color
being
more
closely
examined
this
was
found
to
be
composed
to
the
depth
of
seven
or
eight
and
twelve
inches
entirely
of
the
of
insects
or
in
common
language
of
the
skins
of
worms
about
the
size
of
a
grain
of
oats
which
had
been
washed
up
by
the
waters
of
the
lake
alluding
to
this
subject
some
months
afterwards
when
traveling
through
a
more
southern
portion
of
this
region
in
company
with
joseph
walker
an
old
hunter
i
was
informed
by
him
that
wandering
with
a
party
of
men
in
a
mountain
country
east
of
the
great
california
range
he
surprised
a
party
of
several
indian
families
encamped
near
a
small
salt
lake
who
abandoned
their
lodges
at
his
approach
leaving
every
thing
behind
them
being
in
a
starving
condition
they
were
delighted
to
find
in
the
abandoned
lodges
a
number
of
skin
bags
containing
a
quantity
of
what
appeared
to
be
fish
dried
and
pounded
on
this
they
made
a
hearty
supper
and
were
gathering
around
an
abundant
breakfast
the
next
morning
when
walker
discovered
that
it
was
with
these
or
a
similar
worm
that
the
bags
had
been
filled
the
stomachs
of
the
stout
trappers
were
not
proof
against
their
prejudices
and
the
repulsive
food
was
suddenly
rejected
walker
had
further
opportunities
of
seeing
these
worms
used
as
an
article
of
food
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
they
are
the
same
as
those
we
saw
and
appear
to
be
a
product
of
the
salt
lakes
it
may
be
well
to
recall
to
your
mind
that
walker
was
associated
with
capt
bonneville
in
his
expedition
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
has
since
that
time
remained
in
the
country
generally
residing
in
some
one
of
the
snake
villages
when
not
engaged
in
one
of
his
numerous
trapping
expeditions
in
which
he
is
celebrated
as
one
of
the
best
and
bravest
leaders
who
have
ever
been
in
the
country
the
cliffs
and
masses
of
rock
along
the
shore
were
whitened
by
an
incrustation
of
salt
where
the
waves
dashed
up
against
them
and
the
evaporating
water
which
had
been
left
in
holes
and
hollows
on
the
surface
of
the
rocks
was
covered
with
a
crust
of
salt
about
of
an
inch
in
thickness
it
appeared
strange
that
in
the
midst
of
this
grand
reservoir
one
of
our
greatest
wants
lately
had
been
salt
exposed
to
be
more
perfectly
dried
in
the
sun
this
became
very
white
and
fine
having
the
usual
flavor
of
very
excellent
common
salt
without
any
foreign
taste
but
only
a
little
was
collected
for
present
use
as
there
was
in
it
a
number
of
small
black
insects
carrying
with
us
the
barometer
and
other
instruments
in
the
afternoon
we
ascended
to
the
highest
point
of
the
island
a
bare
rocky
peak
eight
hundred
feet
above
the
lake
standing
on
the
summit
we
enjoyed
an
extended
view
of
the
lake
enclosed
in
a
basin
of
rugged
mountains
which
sometimes
left
marshy
flats
and
extensive
bottoms
between
them
and
the
shore
and
in
other
places
came
directly
down
into
the
water
with
bold
and
precipitous
bluffs
following
with
our
glasses
the
irregular
shores
we
searched
for
some
indications
of
a
communication
with
other
bodies
of
water
or
the
entrance
of
other
rivers
but
the
distance
was
so
great
that
we
could
make
out
nothing
with
certainty
to
the
southward
several
peninsular
mountains
or
feet
high
entered
the
lake
appearing
so
far
as
the
distance
and
our
position
enabled
us
to
determine
to
be
connected
by
flats
and
low
ridges
with
the
mountains
in
the
rear
these
are
probably
the
islands
usually
indicated
on
maps
of
this
region
as
entirely
detached
from
the
shore
the
season
of
our
operations
was
when
the
waters
were
at
their
lowest
stage
at
the
season
of
high
waters
in
the
spring
it
is
probable
that
the
marshes
and
low
grounds
are
overflowed
and
the
surface
of
the
lake
considerably
greater
in
several
places
the
view
was
of
unlimited
extent
here
and
there
a
rocky
islet
appearing
above
the
waters
at
a
great
distance
and
beyond
every
thing
was
vague
and
undefined
as
we
looked
over
the
vast
expanse
of
water
spread
out
beneath
us
and
strained
our
eyes
along
the
silent
shores
over
which
hung
so
much
doubt
and
uncertainty
and
which
were
so
full
of
interest
to
us
i
could
hardly
repress
the
almost
irresistible
desire
to
continue
our
explorations
but
the
lengthening
snow
on
the
mountains
was
a
plain
indication
of
the
advancing
season
and
our
frail
linen
boat
appeared
so
insecure
that
i
was
unwilling
to
trust
our
lives
to
the
uncertainties
of
the
lake
i
therefore
unwillingly
resolved
to
terminate
our
survey
here
and
remain
satisfied
for
the
present
with
what
we
had
been
able
to
add
to
the
unknown
geography
of
the
region
we
felt
pleasure
also
in
remembering
that
we
were
the
first
who
in
the
traditionary
annals
of
the
country
had
visited
the
islands
and
broken
with
the
cheerful
sound
of
human
voices
the
long
solitude
of
the
place
from
the
point
where
we
were
standing
the
ground
fell
off
on
every
side
to
the
water
giving
us
a
perfect
view
of
the
island
which
is
twelve
or
thirteen
miles
in
circumference
being
simply
a
rocky
hill
on
which
there
is
neither
water
nor
trees
of
any
kind
although
the
which
was
in
great
abundance
might
easily
be
taken
for
timber
at
a
distance
the
plant
seemed
here
to
delight
in
a
congenial
air
growing
in
extraordinary
luxuriance
seven
to
eight
feet
high
and
was
very
abundant
on
the
upper
parts
of
the
island
where
it
was
almost
the
only
plant
this
is
eminently
a
saline
shrub
its
leaves
have
a
salt
taste
and
it
luxuriates
in
saline
soils
where
it
is
usually
a
characteristic
it
is
widely
diffused
over
all
this
country
a
chenopodiaceous
shrub
which
is
a
new
species
of
obione
rigida
and
was
equally
characteristic
of
the
lower
parts
of
the
island
these
two
are
the
striking
plants
on
the
island
and
belong
to
a
class
of
plants
which
form
a
prominent
feature
in
the
vegetation
of
this
country
on
the
lower
parts
of
the
island
also
a
prickly
pear
of
very
large
size
was
frequent
on
the
shore
near
the
water
was
a
woolly
species
of
and
a
new
species
of
umbelliferous
plant
was
scattered
about
in
very
considerable
abundance
these
constituted
all
the
vegetation
that
now
appeared
upon
the
island
i
accidentally
left
on
the
summit
the
brass
cover
to
the
object
end
of
my
and
as
it
will
probably
remain
there
undisturbed
by
indians
it
will
furnish
matter
of
speculation
to
some
future
traveler
in
our
excursions
about
the
island
we
did
not
meet
with
any
kind
of
animal
a
magpie
and
another
larger
bird
probably
attracted
by
the
smoke
of
our
fire
paid
us
a
visit
from
the
shore
and
were
the
only
living
things
seen
during
our
stay
the
rock
constituting
the
cliffs
along
the
shore
where
we
were
encamped
is
a
talcous
rock
or
steatite
with
brown
spar
at
sunset
the
temperature
was
we
had
arrived
just
in
time
to
obtain
a
meridian
altitude
of
the
sun
and
other
observations
were
obtained
this
evening
which
placed
our
camp
in
latitude
and
longitude
from
greenwich
from
a
discussion
of
the
barometrical
observations
made
during
our
stay
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
we
have
adopted
feet
for
its
elevation
above
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
the
first
disappointment
we
felt
from
the
dissipation
of
our
dream
of
the
fertile
islands
i
called
this
out
of
the
we
made
ourselves
pleasant
little
lodges
open
to
the
water
and
after
having
kindled
large
fires
to
excite
the
wonder
of
any
straggling
savage
on
the
lake
shores
lay
down
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
journey
in
perfect
security
no
one
thinking
about
his
arms
the
evening
was
extremely
bright
and
pleasant
but
the
wind
rose
during
the
night
and
the
waves
began
to
break
heavily
on
the
shore
making
our
island
tremble
i
had
not
expected
in
our
inland
journey
to
hear
the
roar
of
an
ocean
surf
and
the
strangeness
of
our
situation
and
the
excitement
we
felt
in
the
associated
interest
of
the
place
made
this
one
of
the
most
interesting
nights
i
made
during
our
long
expedition
in
the
morning
the
surf
was
breaking
heavily
on
the
shore
and
we
were
up
early
the
lake
was
dark
and
agitated
and
we
hurried
through
our
scanty
breakfast
and
embarked
having
first
filled
one
of
the
buckets
with
water
from
the
lake
of
which
it
was
intended
to
make
salt
the
sun
had
risen
by
the
time
we
were
ready
to
start
and
it
was
blowing
a
strong
gale
of
wind
almost
directly
off
the
shore
and
raising
a
considerable
sea
in
which
our
boat
strained
very
much
it
roughened
as
we
got
away
from
the
island
and
it
required
all
the
efforts
of
the
men
to
make
any
head
against
the
wind
and
sea
the
gale
rising
with
the
sun
and
there
was
danger
of
being
blown
into
one
of
the
open
reaches
beyond
the
island
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
from
the
beach
the
depth
of
the
water
was
feet
with
a
clay
bottom
but
as
the
working
of
the
boat
was
very
severe
labor
and
during
the
operation
of
sounding
it
was
necessary
to
cease
paddling
during
which
the
boat
lost
considerable
way
i
was
unwilling
to
discourage
the
men
and
reluctantly
gave
up
my
intention
of
ascertaining
the
depth
and
the
character
of
the
bed
there
was
a
general
shout
in
the
boat
when
we
found
ourselves
in
one
fathom
and
we
soon
after
landed
on
a
low
point
of
mud
immediately
under
the
butte
of
the
peninsula
where
we
unloaded
the
boat
and
carried
the
baggage
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
firmer
ground
we
arrived
just
in
time
for
meridian
observation
and
carried
the
barometer
to
the
summit
of
the
butte
which
is
feet
above
the
lake
preuss
set
off
on
foot
for
the
camp
which
was
about
nine
miles
distant
basil
accompanying
him
to
bring
back
horses
for
the
boat
and
baggage
the
shelter
we
raised
on
the
shore
our
scattered
baggage
and
boat
lying
on
the
beach
made
quite
a
picture
and
we
called
this
the
and
another
new
species
of
obione
confertifolia
were
growing
on
the
low
grounds
with
interspersed
spots
of
an
unwholesome
salt
grass
on
a
saline
clay
soil
with
a
few
other
plants
the
horses
arrived
late
in
the
afternoon
by
which
time
the
gale
had
increased
to
such
a
height
that
a
man
could
scarcely
stand
before
it
and
we
were
obliged
to
pack
our
baggage
hastily
as
the
rising
water
of
the
lake
had
already
reached
the
point
where
we
were
halted
looking
back
as
we
rode
off
we
found
the
place
of
recent
encampment
entirely
covered
the
low
plain
through
which
we
rode
to
the
camp
was
covered
with
a
compact
growth
of
shrubs
of
extraordinary
size
and
luxuriance
the
soil
was
sandy
and
saline
flat
places
resembling
the
beds
of
ponds
that
were
bare
of
vegetation
and
covered
with
a
powdery
white
salt
being
interspersed
among
the
shrubs
artemisia
tridentata
was
very
abundant
but
the
plants
were
principally
saline
a
large
and
vigorous
chenopodiaceous
shrub
five
to
eight
feet
high
being
characteristic
with
fremontia
vermicularis
and
a
shrubby
plant
which
seems
to
be
a
new
we
reached
the
camp
in
time
to
escape
a
which
blackened
the
sky
and
were
received
with
a
discharge
of
the
howitzer
by
the
people
who
having
been
unable
to
see
any
thing
of
us
on
the
lake
had
begun
to
feel
some
uneasiness
we
remained
at
this
camp
in
order
to
obtain
some
further
observations
and
to
boil
down
the
water
which
had
been
brought
from
the
lake
for
a
supply
of
salt
roughly
evaporated
over
the
fire
the
five
gallons
of
water
yielded
fourteen
pints
of
very
and
very
white
salt
of
which
the
whole
lake
may
be
regarded
as
a
saturated
solution
a
portion
of
the
salt
thus
obtained
has
been
subjected
to
analysis
giving
in
parts
the
following
proportions
analysis
of
the
salt
chloride
of
sodium
common
salt
chloride
of
calcium
chloride
of
magnesium
sulphate
of
soda
sulphate
of
lime
glancing
your
eye
along
the
map
you
will
see
a
small
stream
entering
south
of
the
spanish
fork
and
the
first
waters
of
that
lake
which
our
road
of
crosses
in
coming
up
from
the
southward
when
i
was
on
this
stream
with
walker
in
that
year
he
informed
me
that
on
the
upper
part
of
the
river
are
immense
beds
of
of
very
great
thickness
which
he
had
frequently
visited
farther
to
the
southward
the
rivers
which
are
affluent
to
the
colorado
such
as
the
rio
virgen
and
gila
river
near
their
mouths
are
impregnated
with
salt
by
the
cliffs
of
between
which
they
pass
these
mines
occur
in
the
same
ridge
in
which
about
miles
to
the
northward
and
subsequently
in
their
more
immediate
neighborhood
we
discovered
the
fossils
belonging
to
the
oolitic
period
and
they
are
probably
connected
with
that
formation
and
are
the
deposite
from
which
the
great
lake
obtains
its
salt
had
we
remained
longer
we
should
have
found
them
in
its
bed
and
in
the
mountains
around
its
shores
by
observation
the
latitude
of
this
camp
is
and
longitude
the
observations
made
during
our
stay
give
for
the
rate
of
the
chronometer
corresponding
almost
exactly
with
the
rate
obtained
at
vrain
fort
barometrical
observations
were
made
almost
hourly
during
the
day
this
morning
we
breakfasted
on
yampah
and
had
only
kamas
for
supper
but
a
cup
of
good
coffee
still
distinguished
us
from
our
acquaintances
the
morning
was
clear
and
calm
with
a
temperature
at
sunrise
of
we
resumed
our
journey
late
in
the
day
returning
by
nearly
the
same
route
which
we
had
traveled
in
coming
to
the
lake
and
avoiding
the
passage
of
hawthorn
creek
struck
the
hills
a
little
below
the
hot
the
flat
plain
we
had
here
passed
over
consisted
alternately
of
tolerably
good
sandy
soil
and
of
saline
plats
we
encamped
early
on
clear
creek
at
the
foot
of
the
high
ridge
one
of
the
peaks
of
which
we
ascertained
by
measurement
to
be
feet
above
the
lake
or
about
feet
above
the
sea
behind
these
front
peaks
the
ridge
rises
towards
the
bear
river
mountains
which
are
probably
as
high
as
the
wind
river
chain
this
creek
is
here
unusually
well
timbered
with
a
variety
of
trees
among
them
were
birch
the
poplar
several
kinds
of
willow
hawthorn
alder
and
with
an
oak
allied
to
but
very
distinct
from
that
or
any
other
species
in
the
united
states
we
had
a
supper
of
which
carson
killed
near
the
lake
although
cool
the
thermometer
standing
at
musquitoes
were
sufficiently
numerous
to
be
troublesome
this
evening
continuing
up
the
river
valley
we
crossed
several
small
streams
the
mountains
on
the
right
appearing
to
consist
of
the
blue
limestone
which
we
had
observed
in
the
same
ridge
to
the
northward
alternating
here
with
a
granular
quartz
already
mentioned
one
of
these
streams
which
forms
a
smaller
lake
near
the
river
was
broken
up
into
several
channels
and
the
irrigated
bottom
of
fertile
soil
was
covered
with
innumerable
flowers
among
which
were
purple
fields
of
with
helianthi
a
handsome
solidago
and
a
variety
of
other
plants
in
bloom
continuing
along
the
foot
of
the
hills
in
the
afternoon
we
found
five
or
six
gushing
out
together
beneath
a
conglomerate
consisting
principally
of
fragments
of
a
limestone
efflorescing
a
salt
upon
the
surface
the
temperature
of
these
springs
was
and
the
rocks
in
the
bed
were
colored
with
a
red
deposite
and
there
was
common
salt
crystallized
on
the
margin
there
was
also
a
white
incrustation
upon
leaves
and
roots
consisting
principally
of
carbonate
of
lime
there
were
rushes
seen
along
the
road
this
afternoon
and
the
soil
under
the
hills
was
very
black
and
apparently
very
good
but
at
this
time
the
grass
is
entirely
dried
up
we
encamped
on
bear
river
immediately
below
a
the
canon
by
which
the
river
enters
this
valley
bearing
north
by
compass
the
night
was
mild
with
a
very
clear
sky
and
i
obtained
a
very
excellent
observation
of
an
occultation
of
tau
arietis
with
other
observations
both
immersion
and
emersion
of
the
star
were
observed
but
as
our
observations
have
shown
the
phase
at
the
bright
limb
generally
gives
incorrect
longitudes
and
we
have
adopted
the
result
obtained
from
the
emersion
at
the
dark
limb
without
allowing
any
weight
to
the
immersion
according
to
these
observations
the
longitude
is
and
the
latitude
all
the
longitudes
on
the
line
of
our
outward
journey
between
vrain
fort
and
the
dalles
of
the
columbia
which
were
not
directly
determined
by
satellites
have
been
chronometrically
referred
to
this
place
the
people
were
rather
hunger
making
them
very
quiet
and
peaceable
and
there
was
rarely
an
oath
to
be
heard
in
the
camp
not
even
a
solitary
de
it
was
time
for
the
men
with
an
expected
supply
of
provisions
from
fitzpatrick
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
and
the
gun
was
fired
at
evening
to
give
notice
of
our
locality
but
met
with
no
response
about
four
miles
from
this
encampment
the
trail
led
us
down
to
the
river
where
we
unexpectedly
found
an
excellent
ford
the
stream
being
widened
by
an
island
and
not
yet
disengaged
from
the
hills
at
the
foot
of
the
range
we
encamped
on
a
little
creek
where
we
had
made
a
noon
halt
in
descending
the
river
the
night
was
very
clear
and
pleasant
the
sunset
temperature
being
the
people
this
evening
looked
so
forlorn
that
i
gave
them
permission
to
kill
a
fat
young
horse
which
i
had
purchased
with
goods
from
the
snake
indians
and
they
were
very
soon
restored
to
gayety
and
good
humor
preuss
and
myself
could
not
yet
overcome
some
remains
of
civilized
prejudices
and
preferred
to
starve
a
little
longer
feeling
as
much
saddened
as
if
a
crime
had
been
committed
the
next
day
we
continued
up
the
valley
the
soil
being
sometimes
very
black
and
good
occasionally
gravelly
and
occasionally
a
kind
of
naked
salt
plains
we
found
on
the
way
this
morning
a
small
encampment
of
two
families
of
snake
indians
from
whom
we
purchased
a
small
quantity
of
they
had
piles
of
seeds
of
three
different
kinds
spread
out
upon
pieces
of
buffalo
robe
and
the
squaws
had
just
gathered
about
a
bushel
of
the
root
of
a
thistle
they
were
about
the
ordinary
size
of
carrots
and
as
i
have
previously
mentioned
are
sweet
and
well
flavored
requiring
only
a
long
preparation
they
had
a
band
of
twelve
or
fifteen
horses
and
appeared
to
be
growing
in
the
sunshine
with
about
as
little
labor
as
the
plants
they
were
eating
shortly
afterwards
we
met
an
indian
on
horseback
who
had
killed
an
antelope
which
we
purchased
of
him
for
a
little
powder
and
some
balls
we
crossed
the
roseaux
and
encamped
on
the
left
bank
halting
early
for
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
a
wholesome
and
abundant
supper
and
were
pleasantly
engaged
in
protracting
our
unusual
comfort
when
tabeau
galloped
into
the
camp
with
news
that
fitzpatrick
was
encamped
close
by
us
with
a
good
supply
of
provisions
flour
rice
and
dried
meat
and
even
a
little
butter
excitement
made
us
all
wakeful
and
after
a
breakfast
before
sunrise
the
next
morning
we
were
again
on
the
road
and
continuing
up
the
valley
crossed
some
high
points
of
hills
and
halted
to
noon
on
the
same
stream
near
several
lodges
of
snake
indians
from
whom
we
purchased
about
a
bushel
of
partially
dried
by
the
gift
of
a
knife
i
prevailed
upon
a
little
boy
to
show
me
the
plant
which
proved
to
be
the
root
which
constitutes
the
is
large
of
a
very
bright
yellow
color
with
the
characteristic
odor
but
not
so
fully
developed
as
in
the
prepared
substance
it
loves
the
rich
moist
soil
of
river
bottoms
which
was
the
locality
in
which
i
always
afterwards
found
it
it
was
now
entirely
out
of
bloom
according
to
my
observation
flowering
in
the
months
of
may
and
june
in
the
afternoon
we
entered
a
long
ravine
leading
to
a
pass
in
the
dividing
ridge
between
the
waters
of
bear
river
and
the
snake
river
or
lewis
fork
of
the
columbia
our
way
being
very
much
impeded
and
almost
entirely
blocked
up
by
compact
fields
of
luxuriant
artemisia
taking
leave
at
this
point
of
the
waters
of
bear
river
and
of
the
geographical
basin
which
encloses
the
system
of
rivers
and
creeks
which
belong
to
the
great
salt
lake
and
which
so
richly
deserves
a
future
detailed
and
ample
exploration
i
can
say
of
it
in
general
terms
that
the
bottoms
of
this
river
bear
and
of
some
of
the
creeks
which
i
saw
form
a
natural
resting
and
recruiting
station
for
travelers
now
and
in
all
time
to
come
the
bottoms
are
extensive
water
excellent
timber
sufficient
the
soil
good
and
well
adapted
to
grains
and
grasses
suited
to
such
an
elevated
region
a
military
post
and
a
civilized
settlement
would
be
of
great
value
here
grass
and
salt
so
much
abound
the
lake
will
furnish
exhaustless
supplies
of
salt
all
the
mountains
here
are
covered
with
a
valuable
nutritious
grass
called
from
the
form
in
which
it
grows
which
has
a
second
growth
in
the
fall
the
beasts
of
the
indians
were
fat
upon
it
our
own
found
it
a
good
subsistence
and
its
quantity
will
sustain
any
amount
of
cattle
and
make
this
truly
a
bucolic
region
we
met
here
an
indian
family
on
horseback
which
had
been
out
to
gather
and
were
returning
loaded
this
tree
was
scattered
about
on
the
hills
and
the
upper
part
of
the
pass
was
timbered
with
aspen
the
common
blue
occurring
among
the
plants
the
approach
to
the
pass
was
very
steep
and
the
summit
about
feet
above
the
sea
probably
only
an
uncertain
approximation
as
at
the
time
of
observation
it
was
blowing
a
violent
gale
of
wind
from
the
northwest
with
scattered
in
masses
over
the
sky
the
day
otherwise
bright
and
clear
we
descended
by
a
steep
slope
into
a
broad
open
valley
good
soil
from
four
to
five
miles
wide
coming
down
immediately
upon
one
of
the
of
the
pannack
river
which
here
loses
itself
in
swampy
ground
the
appearance
of
the
country
here
is
not
very
interesting
on
either
side
is
a
regular
range
of
mountains
of
the
usual
character
with
a
little
timber
tolerably
rocky
on
the
right
and
higher
and
more
smooth
on
the
left
with
still
higher
peaks
looking
out
above
the
range
the
valley
afforded
a
good
level
road
but
it
was
late
when
it
brought
us
to
water
and
we
encamped
at
dark
the
wind
had
blown
up
very
cold
weather
and
the
artemisia
which
was
our
firewood
did
not
happen
to
be
very
abundant
this
plant
loves
a
dry
sandy
soil
and
can
not
grow
in
the
good
bottoms
where
it
is
rich
and
moist
but
on
every
little
eminence
where
water
does
not
rest
long
it
maintains
absolute
possession
elevation
above
the
sea
about
feet
at
night
scattered
fires
glimmered
along
the
mountains
pointing
out
camps
of
the
indians
and
we
contrasted
the
comparative
security
in
which
we
traveled
through
this
country
with
the
guarded
vigilance
we
were
compelled
to
exert
among
the
sioux
and
other
indians
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
rocky
mountains
at
sunset
the
thermometer
was
at
and
at
midnight
at
the
morning
sky
was
calm
and
clear
the
temperature
at
daylight
being
and
at
sunrise
there
is
throughout
this
country
a
remarkable
difference
between
the
morning
and
temperatures
which
at
this
season
was
very
generally
or
and
occasionally
greater
and
frequently
after
a
very
frosty
morning
the
heat
in
a
few
hours
would
render
the
thinnest
clothing
agreeable
about
noon
we
reached
the
main
fork
the
pannack
river
was
before
us
the
valley
being
here
miles
wide
fertile
and
bordered
by
smooth
hills
not
over
feet
high
partly
covered
with
cedar
a
high
ridge
in
which
there
is
a
prominent
peak
rising
behind
those
on
the
left
we
continued
to
descend
this
stream
and
found
on
it
at
night
a
warm
and
comfortable
camp
flax
occurred
so
frequently
during
the
day
as
to
be
almost
a
characteristic
and
the
soil
appeared
excellent
the
evening
was
gusty
with
a
temperature
at
sunset
of
i
obtained
about
midnight
an
observation
of
an
emersion
of
the
first
satellite
the
night
being
calm
and
very
clear
the
stars
remarkably
bright
and
the
thermometer
at
longitude
from
mean
of
satellite
and
chronometer
and
latitude
by
observation
the
day
clear
and
calm
with
a
temperature
of
at
sunrise
after
traveling
seven
or
eight
miles
we
emerged
on
the
plains
of
the
columbia
in
sight
of
the
famous
a
landmark
in
the
country
distant
about
miles
the
french
word
which
so
often
occurs
in
this
narrative
is
retained
from
the
familiar
language
of
the
country
and
identifies
the
objects
to
which
it
refers
it
is
naturalized
in
the
region
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
even
if
desirable
to
render
it
in
english
i
know
of
no
word
which
would
be
its
precise
equivalent
it
is
applied
to
the
detached
hills
and
ridges
which
rise
rapidly
and
reach
too
high
to
be
called
hills
or
ridges
and
not
high
enough
to
be
called
mountains
as
applied
in
the
western
states
is
their
descriptive
term
in
english
is
the
spanish
term
but
no
translation
or
periphrasis
would
preserve
the
identity
of
these
picturesque
landmarks
familiar
to
the
traveler
and
often
seen
at
a
great
distance
covered
as
far
as
could
be
seen
with
artemisia
the
dark
and
ugly
appearance
of
this
plain
obtained
for
it
the
name
of
and
we
were
agreeably
surprised
on
reaching
the
portneuf
river
to
see
a
beautiful
green
valley
with
scattered
timber
spread
out
beneath
us
on
which
about
four
miles
distant
were
glistening
the
white
walls
of
the
fort
the
portneuf
runs
along
the
upland
plain
nearly
to
its
mouth
and
an
abrupt
descent
of
perhaps
two
hundred
feet
brought
us
down
immediately
upon
the
stream
which
at
the
ford
is
one
hundred
yards
wide
and
three
feet
deep
with
clear
water
a
swift
current
and
gravelly
bed
but
a
little
higher
up
the
breadth
was
only
about
yards
with
apparently
deep
water
in
the
bottom
i
remarked
a
very
great
number
of
springs
and
sloughs
with
remarkably
clear
water
and
gravel
beds
at
sunset
we
encamped
with
talbot
and
our
friends
who
came
on
to
fort
hall
when
we
went
to
the
lake
and
whom
we
had
the
satisfaction
to
find
all
well
neither
party
having
met
with
any
mischance
in
the
interval
of
our
separation
they
too
had
had
their
share
of
fatigue
and
scanty
provisions
as
there
had
been
very
little
game
left
on
the
trail
of
the
populous
emigration
and
fitzpatrick
had
rigidly
husbanded
our
stock
of
flour
and
light
provisions
in
view
of
the
approaching
winter
and
the
long
journey
before
us
this
morning
the
sky
was
very
dark
and
gloomy
and
at
daylight
it
began
snowing
thickly
and
continued
all
day
with
cold
disagreeable
weather
at
sunrise
the
temperature
was
i
rode
up
to
the
fort
and
purchased
from
grant
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
post
several
very
indifferent
horses
and
five
oxen
in
very
fine
order
which
were
received
at
the
camp
with
great
satisfaction
and
one
being
killed
at
evening
the
usual
gayety
and
good
humor
were
at
once
restored
night
came
in
stormy
we
had
a
night
of
snow
and
rain
and
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
was
at
the
morning
was
dark
with
a
steady
rain
and
there
was
still
an
inch
of
snow
on
the
ground
with
an
abundance
on
the
neighboring
hills
and
mountains
the
sudden
change
in
the
weather
was
hard
for
our
animals
who
trembled
and
shivered
in
the
cold
sometimes
taking
refuge
in
the
timber
and
now
and
then
coming
out
and
raking
the
snow
off
the
ground
for
a
little
grass
or
eating
the
young
willows
ice
made
tolerably
thick
during
this
night
and
in
the
morning
the
weather
cleared
up
very
bright
with
a
temperature
at
sunrise
of
and
i
obtained
a
meridian
observation
for
latitude
at
the
fort
with
observations
for
time
the
sky
was
again
covered
in
the
afternoon
and
the
thermometer
at
sunset
the
morning
was
cloudy
and
unpleasant
and
at
sunrise
a
cold
rain
commenced
with
a
temperature
of
the
early
approach
of
winter
and
the
difficulty
of
supporting
a
large
party
determined
me
to
send
back
a
number
of
the
men
who
had
become
satisfied
that
they
were
not
fitted
for
the
laborious
service
and
frequent
privation
to
which
they
were
necessarily
exposed
and
which
there
was
reason
to
believe
would
become
more
severe
in
the
further
extension
of
the
voyage
i
accordingly
called
them
together
and
informing
them
of
my
intention
to
continue
our
journey
during
the
ensuing
winter
in
the
course
of
which
they
would
probably
be
exposed
to
considerable
hardship
succeeded
in
prevailing
on
a
number
of
them
to
return
voluntarily
these
were
charles
de
forrest
henry
lee
campbell
wm
creuss
vasquez
pera
patrick
white
tesson
creely
françois
lajeunesse
basil
lajeunesse
among
these
i
regretted
very
much
to
lose
basil
lajeunesse
one
of
the
best
men
in
my
party
who
was
obliged
by
the
condition
of
his
family
to
be
at
home
in
the
coming
winter
our
preparations
having
been
completed
in
the
interval
of
our
stay
here
both
parties
were
ready
this
morning
to
resume
their
respective
routes
except
that
there
is
a
greater
quantity
of
wood
used
in
its
construction
fort
hall
very
much
resembles
the
other
trading
posts
which
have
already
been
described
to
you
and
would
be
another
excellent
post
of
relief
for
the
emigration
it
is
in
the
low
rich
bottom
of
a
valley
apparently
miles
long
formed
by
the
confluence
of
portneuf
river
with
lewis
fork
of
the
columbia
which
it
enters
about
nine
miles
below
the
fort
and
narrowing
gradually
to
the
mouth
of
the
pannack
river
where
it
has
a
breadth
of
only
two
or
three
miles
allowing
miles
for
the
road
from
the
of
bear
river
to
fort
hall
its
distance
along
the
road
from
the
town
of
westport
on
the
frontier
of
missouri
by
way
of
fort
laramie
and
the
great
south
pass
is
miles
beyond
this
place
on
the
line
of
road
along
the
valley
of
the
upper
columbia
there
does
not
occur
for
a
distance
of
nearly
miles
to
the
westward
a
fertile
spot
of
ground
sufficiently
large
to
produce
the
necessary
quantity
of
grain
or
pasturage
enough
to
allow
even
a
temporary
repose
to
the
emigrants
on
their
recent
passage
they
had
been
able
to
obtain
at
very
high
prices
and
in
insufficient
quantity
only
such
assistance
as
could
be
afforded
by
a
small
and
remote
and
that
a
foreign
one
which
in
the
supply
of
its
own
wants
had
necessarily
drawn
around
it
some
of
the
resources
of
civilization
but
which
obtained
nearly
all
its
supplies
from
the
distant
depot
of
vancouver
by
a
difficult
of
miles
up
the
columbia
river
and
a
by
of
miles
an
american
military
post
sufficiently
strong
to
give
to
their
road
a
perfect
security
against
the
indian
tribes
who
are
unsettled
in
locality
and
very
in
their
disposition
and
which
with
the
necessary
facilities
for
the
repair
of
their
equipage
would
be
able
to
afford
them
relief
in
stock
and
grain
from
the
produce
of
the
post
would
be
of
extraordinary
value
to
the
emigration
such
a
post
and
all
others
which
may
be
established
on
the
line
to
oregon
would
naturally
form
the
of
a
settlement
at
which
supplies
and
repose
would
be
obtained
by
the
emigrant
or
trading
caravans
which
may
hereafter
traverse
these
elevated
and
in
many
places
desolate
and
inhospitable
regions
i
subjoin
an
analysis
of
the
soil
in
the
river
bottom
near
fort
hall
which
will
be
of
assistance
in
enabling
you
to
form
some
correct
idea
of
its
general
character
in
the
neighboring
country
i
characterize
it
as
good
land
but
the
analysis
will
show
its
precise
properties
of
the
silicina
alumina
carbonate
of
lime
carbonate
of
magnesia
oxide
of
iron
organic
vegetable
matter
water
and
loss
our
observations
place
this
post
in
longitude
latitude
and
the
elevation
above
the
sea
feet
taking
leave
of
the
homeward
party
we
resumed
our
journey
down
the
valley
the
weather
being
very
cold
and
the
rain
coming
in
hard
gusts
which
the
wind
blew
directly
in
our
faces
we
forded
the
portneuf
in
a
storm
of
rain
the
water
in
the
river
being
frequently
up
to
the
axles
and
about
yards
wide
after
the
gust
the
weather
improved
a
little
and
we
encamped
about
three
miles
below
at
the
mouth
of
the
pannack
river
on
lewis
fork
which
here
has
a
breadth
of
about
yards
the
temperature
at
sunset
was
the
sky
partially
covered
with
dark
rainy
clouds
the
temperature
at
sunrise
was
the
morning
dark
and
snow
falling
steadily
and
thickly
with
a
light
air
from
the
southward
profited
of
being
obliged
to
remain
in
camp
to
take
hourly
barometrical
observations
from
sunrise
to
midnight
the
wind
at
eleven
set
in
from
the
in
heavy
gusts
and
the
snow
changed
into
rain
in
the
afternoon
when
the
sky
brightened
the
rain
had
washed
all
the
snow
from
the
bottoms
but
the
neighboring
mountains
from
summit
to
foot
were
luminously
white
an
inauspicious
commencement
of
the
autumn
of
which
this
was
the
first
day
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
was
and
a
blue
sky
in
the
west
promised
a
fine
day
the
river
bottoms
here
are
narrow
and
swampy
with
frequent
sloughs
and
after
crossing
the
pannack
the
road
continued
along
the
uplands
rendered
very
slippery
by
the
soil
of
wet
clay
and
entirely
covered
with
artemisia
bushes
among
which
occur
frequent
fragments
of
obsidian
at
noon
we
encamped
in
a
grove
of
willows
at
the
upper
end
of
a
group
of
islands
about
half
a
mile
above
the
of
snake
river
among
the
willows
here
were
some
bushes
of
lewis
and
clarke
currant
the
river
here
enters
between
low
mural
banks
which
consist
of
a
fine
vesicular
the
intermediate
portions
being
compact
and
crystalline
gradually
becoming
higher
in
its
downward
course
these
banks
of
scoriated
volcanic
rock
form
with
occasional
interruptions
its
characteristic
feature
along
the
whole
line
to
the
dalles
of
the
lower
columbia
resembling
a
chasm
which
had
been
rent
through
the
country
and
which
the
river
had
afterwards
taken
for
its
bed
the
immediate
valley
of
the
river
is
a
high
plain
covered
with
black
rocks
and
artemisias
in
the
south
is
a
bordering
range
of
mountains
which
although
not
very
high
are
broken
and
covered
with
snow
and
at
a
great
distance
to
the
north
is
seen
the
high
snowy
line
of
the
salmon
river
mountains
in
front
of
which
stand
out
prominently
in
the
plain
the
three
isolated
mountains
commonly
known
as
the
between
the
river
and
the
distant
salmon
river
range
the
plain
is
represented
by
fitzpatrick
as
so
entirely
broken
up
and
rent
into
chasms
as
to
be
impracticable
for
a
man
even
on
foot
in
the
sketch
annexed
the
point
of
view
is
low
but
it
conveys
very
well
some
idea
of
the
open
character
of
the
country
with
the
buttes
rising
out
above
the
general
line
by
measurement
the
river
above
is
feet
wide
immediately
contracted
at
the
fall
in
the
form
of
a
lock
by
jutting
piles
of
scoriaceous
basalt
over
which
the
foaming
river
must
present
a
grand
appearance
at
the
time
of
high
water
the
evening
was
clear
and
pleasant
with
dew
and
at
sunset
the
temperature
was
by
observation
the
latitude
is
and
the
longitude
a
few
hundred
yards
below
the
falls
and
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
is
an
escarpment
from
which
we
obtained
some
specimens
thermometer
at
sunrise
the
day
came
in
clear
with
a
strong
gale
from
the
south
which
commenced
at
eleven
of
the
last
night
the
road
led
along
the
river
which
is
full
of
rapids
and
small
falls
grass
is
very
scanty
and
along
the
rugged
banks
are
scattered
cedars
with
an
abundance
of
rocks
and
sage
we
traveled
fourteen
miles
and
encamped
in
the
afternoon
near
the
river
on
a
rocky
creek
the
bed
of
which
was
entirely
occupied
with
boulders
of
a
very
large
size
for
the
last
three
or
four
miles
the
right
bank
of
the
river
has
a
palisaded
appearance
one
of
the
oxen
was
killed
here
for
food
the
thermometer
at
evening
was
at
the
sky
almost
overcast
and
the
barometer
indicated
an
elevation
of
feet
rain
during
the
night
and
the
temperature
at
sunrise
traveling
along
the
river
in
about
four
miles
we
reached
a
picturesque
stream
to
which
we
gave
the
name
of
fall
creek
it
is
remarkable
for
the
many
falls
which
occur
in
a
short
distance
and
its
bed
is
composed
of
a
calcareous
tufa
or
vegetable
rock
composed
principally
of
the
remains
of
reeds
and
mosses
resembling
that
at
the
on
bear
river
the
road
along
the
river
bluffs
had
been
occasionally
very
bad
and
imagining
that
some
rough
obstacles
rendered
such
a
detour
necessary
we
followed
for
several
miles
a
plain
leading
up
this
stream
until
we
reached
a
point
whence
it
could
be
seen
making
directly
towards
a
low
place
in
the
range
on
the
south
side
of
the
valley
and
we
became
immediately
aware
that
we
were
on
a
trail
formed
by
a
party
of
wagons
in
company
with
whom
we
had
encamped
at
elm
grove
near
the
frontier
of
missouri
and
which
you
will
remember
were
proceeding
to
upper
california
under
the
direction
of
jos
chiles
at
the
time
of
their
departure
no
practicable
passes
were
known
in
the
southern
rocky
mountains
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states
and
the
probable
apprehension
of
difficulty
in
attempting
to
pass
near
the
settled
frontier
of
new
mexico
together
with
the
desert
character
of
the
unexplored
region
beyond
had
induced
them
to
take
a
more
northern
and
circuitous
route
by
way
of
the
sweet
water
pass
and
fort
hall
they
had
still
between
them
and
the
valley
of
the
sacramento
a
great
mass
of
mountains
forming
the
here
commonly
known
as
the
california
and
which
were
at
this
time
considered
as
presenting
an
impracticable
barrier
to
various
considerations
had
suggested
to
them
a
division
of
the
party
and
a
greater
portion
of
the
camp
including
the
wagons
with
the
mail
and
other
stores
were
now
proceeding
under
the
guidance
of
joseph
walker
who
had
engaged
to
conduct
them
by
a
long
sweep
to
the
southward
around
what
is
called
the
of
the
and
crossing
through
a
pass
known
only
to
himself
gain
the
banks
of
the
sacramento
by
the
valley
of
the
san
joaquin
it
was
a
long
and
a
hazardous
journey
for
a
party
in
which
there
were
women
and
children
sixty
days
was
the
shortest
period
of
time
in
which
they
could
reach
the
point
of
the
mountain
and
their
route
lay
through
a
country
inhabited
by
wild
and
indians
and
very
poor
in
game
but
the
leader
was
a
man
possessing
great
and
intimate
knowledge
of
the
indians
with
an
extraordinary
firmness
and
decision
of
character
in
the
mean
time
chiles
had
passed
down
the
columbia
with
a
party
of
ten
or
twelve
men
with
the
intention
of
reaching
the
settlements
on
the
sacramento
by
a
more
direct
course
which
indefinite
information
from
hunters
had
indicated
in
the
direction
of
the
of
the
aux
and
having
obtained
there
a
reinforcement
of
animals
and
a
supply
of
provisions
meet
the
wagons
before
they
should
have
reached
the
point
of
the
mountain
at
a
place
which
had
been
previously
agreed
upon
in
the
course
of
our
narrative
we
shall
be
able
to
give
you
some
information
of
the
fortunes
which
attended
the
movements
of
these
adventurous
travelers
having
discovered
our
error
we
immediately
regained
the
line
along
the
river
which
the
road
quitted
about
noon
and
encamped
at
five
on
the
stream
called
raft
river
aux
having
traveled
only
miles
in
the
north
the
salmon
river
mountains
are
visible
at
a
very
far
distance
and
on
the
left
the
ridge
in
which
raft
river
heads
is
about
miles
distant
rocky
and
tolerably
high
thermometer
at
sunset
with
a
partially
clouded
sky
and
a
sharp
wind
from
the
it
was
now
no
longer
possible
as
in
our
previous
journey
to
travel
regularly
every
day
and
find
at
any
moment
a
convenient
place
for
repose
at
noon
or
a
camp
at
night
but
the
were
now
generally
fixed
along
the
road
by
the
nature
of
the
country
at
places
where
with
water
there
was
a
little
scanty
grass
since
leaving
the
american
falls
the
road
had
frequently
been
very
bad
the
many
short
steep
ascents
exhausting
the
strength
of
our
animals
requiring
always
at
such
places
the
assistance
of
the
men
to
get
up
each
cart
one
by
one
and
our
progress
with
twelve
or
fourteen
though
light
and
made
for
the
purpose
in
such
a
rocky
country
was
extremely
slow
and
i
again
determined
to
gain
time
by
a
division
of
the
camp
accordingly
the
parties
again
separated
constituted
very
much
as
before
fitzpatrick
remaining
in
charge
of
the
heavier
baggage
the
morning
was
calm
and
clear
with
a
white
frost
and
the
temperature
at
sunrise
the
country
had
a
very
forbidding
appearance
and
after
traveling
miles
over
a
slightly
undulating
plain
we
encamped
at
a
considerable
spring
called
swamp
creek
rising
in
low
grounds
near
the
point
of
a
spur
from
the
mountain
returning
with
a
small
party
in
a
starving
condition
from
the
westward
or
years
since
carson
had
met
here
three
or
four
buffalo
bulls
two
of
which
were
killed
they
were
among
the
pioneers
which
had
made
the
experiment
of
colonizing
in
the
valley
of
the
columbia
and
which
had
failed
as
heretofore
stated
at
sunset
the
thermometer
was
at
and
the
evening
was
overcast
with
a
cool
wind
from
the
and
we
had
only
sage
for
firewood
mingled
with
the
artemisia
was
a
shrubby
and
thorny
chenopodiaceous
plant
at
sunrise
the
wind
rose
early
to
a
gale
from
the
west
with
a
very
cold
driving
rain
and
after
an
uncomfortable
day
ride
of
miles
we
were
glad
when
at
evening
we
found
a
sheltered
camp
where
there
was
an
abundance
of
wood
at
some
elevated
rocky
islands
covered
with
cedar
near
the
commencement
of
another
long
canon
of
the
river
with
the
exception
of
a
short
detention
at
a
deep
little
stream
called
goose
creek
and
some
occasional
rocky
places
we
had
a
very
good
road
but
the
country
has
a
barren
appearance
sandy
and
densely
covered
with
the
artemisias
from
the
banks
of
the
river
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
here
i
remarked
among
the
sage
bushes
green
bunches
of
what
is
called
the
second
growth
of
grass
the
river
has
had
a
smooth
appearance
free
from
rapids
with
a
low
sandy
bordering
the
bottoms
in
which
there
is
a
little
good
soil
thermometer
at
sunset
blowing
a
gale
and
disagreeably
cold
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
with
a
bright
sun
and
appearance
of
finer
weather
the
road
for
several
miles
was
rocky
and
consequently
bad
but
entering
after
this
a
sandy
country
it
became
very
good
with
no
other
interruption
than
the
sage
bushes
which
covered
the
river
plain
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
with
their
uniform
tint
of
dark
gray
gave
to
the
country
a
gloomy
and
sombre
appearance
all
the
day
the
course
of
the
river
has
been
between
walls
of
the
black
volcanic
rock
a
dark
line
of
the
escarpment
on
the
opposite
side
pointing
out
its
course
and
sweeping
along
in
foam
at
places
where
the
mountains
which
border
the
valley
present
always
on
the
left
two
ranges
the
lower
one
a
spur
of
the
higher
and
on
the
opposite
side
the
salmon
river
mountains
are
visible
at
a
great
distance
having
made
miles
we
encamped
about
five
on
rock
creek
a
stream
having
considerable
water
a
swift
current
and
wooded
with
willow
thermometer
at
sunrise
in
its
progress
towards
the
river
this
creek
soon
enters
a
chasm
of
the
volcanic
rock
which
in
places
along
the
wall
presents
a
columnar
appearance
and
the
road
becomes
extremely
rocky
whenever
it
passes
near
its
banks
it
is
only
about
twenty
feet
wide
where
the
road
crosses
it
with
a
deep
bed
and
steep
banks
covered
with
rocky
fragments
with
willows
and
a
little
grass
on
its
narrow
bottom
the
soil
appears
to
be
full
of
calcareous
matter
with
which
the
rocks
are
incrusted
the
fragments
of
rock
which
had
been
removed
by
the
emigrants
in
making
a
road
where
we
ascended
from
the
bed
of
this
creek
were
whitened
with
lime
and
during
the
afternoon
march
i
remarked
in
the
soil
a
considerably
quantity
of
calcareous
concretions
towards
evening
the
sages
became
more
sparse
and
the
clear
spaces
were
occupied
by
tufts
of
green
grass
the
river
still
continued
its
course
through
a
trough
or
open
canon
and
towards
sunset
we
followed
the
trail
of
several
wagons
which
had
turned
in
towards
snake
river
and
encamped
as
they
had
done
on
the
top
of
the
escarpment
there
was
no
grass
here
the
soil
among
the
sage
being
entirely
naked
but
there
is
occasionally
a
little
bottom
along
the
river
which
a
short
ravine
of
rocks
at
rare
intervals
leaves
accessible
and
by
one
of
these
we
drove
our
animals
down
and
found
some
tolerably
good
grass
bordering
the
water
immediately
opposite
to
us
a
subterranean
river
bursts
out
directly
from
the
face
of
the
escarpment
and
falls
in
white
foam
to
the
river
below
the
main
river
is
enclosed
with
mural
precipices
which
form
its
characteristic
feature
along
a
great
portion
of
its
course
a
melancholy
and
country
one
of
fracture
and
violence
and
fire
we
had
brought
with
us
when
we
separated
from
the
camp
a
large
gaunt
ox
in
appearance
very
poor
but
being
killed
to
the
great
joy
of
the
people
he
was
found
to
be
remarkably
fat
as
usual
at
such
occurrences
the
evening
was
devoted
to
gayety
and
feasting
abundant
fare
now
made
an
epoch
among
us
and
in
this
laborious
life
in
such
a
country
as
this
our
men
had
but
little
else
to
enjoy
the
temperature
at
sunset
was
with
a
clear
sky
and
a
very
high
wind
by
the
observation
of
the
evening
the
encampment
was
in
longitude
and
in
latitude
october
the
morning
clear
with
wind
from
the
west
and
the
thermometer
at
we
descended
to
the
bottoms
taking
with
us
the
boat
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
the
fall
in
the
opposite
cliffs
and
while
it
was
being
filled
with
air
we
occupied
ourselves
in
measuring
the
river
which
is
feet
in
breadth
with
banks
feet
high
we
were
surprised
on
our
arrival
at
the
opposite
side
to
find
a
beautiful
basin
of
clear
water
formed
by
the
falling
river
around
which
the
rocks
were
whitened
by
some
saline
incrustation
here
the
indians
had
constructed
wicker
dams
although
i
was
informed
that
the
salmon
do
not
ascend
the
river
so
far
and
its
character
below
would
apparently
render
it
impracticable
the
ascent
of
the
steep
was
rendered
a
little
difficult
by
a
dense
growth
of
shrubs
and
fields
of
cane
and
there
were
frequent
hidden
crevices
among
the
rocks
where
the
water
was
heard
rushing
below
but
we
succeeded
in
reaching
the
main
stream
which
issuing
from
between
strata
of
the
in
two
principal
branches
produced
almost
immediately
a
torrent
feet
wide
and
white
with
foam
it
is
a
picturesque
spot
of
singular
beauty
overshadowed
by
bushes
from
under
which
the
torrent
glances
tumbling
into
the
white
basin
below
where
the
clear
water
contrasted
beautifully
with
the
muddy
stream
of
the
river
its
outlet
was
covered
with
a
rank
growth
of
canes
and
a
variety
of
unusual
plants
and
nettles
which
before
they
were
noticed
had
set
our
hands
and
arms
on
fire
the
temperature
of
the
spring
was
while
that
of
the
river
was
the
perpendicular
height
of
the
place
at
which
this
stream
issues
is
feet
above
the
river
and
feet
below
the
summit
of
the
precipice
making
nearly
feet
for
the
height
of
the
wall
on
the
here
was
obtained
a
specimen
consisting
principally
of
fragments
of
the
shells
of
small
crustacea
and
which
was
probably
formed
by
deposition
from
these
springs
proceeding
from
some
lake
or
river
in
the
highlands
above
we
resumed
our
journey
at
noon
the
day
being
hot
and
bright
and
after
a
march
of
miles
encamped
at
sunset
on
the
river
near
several
lodges
of
snake
indians
our
encampment
was
about
one
mile
below
the
a
series
of
cataracts
with
very
inclined
planes
which
are
probably
so
named
because
they
form
a
barrier
to
the
ascent
of
the
salmon
and
the
great
fisheries
from
which
the
inhabitants
of
this
barren
region
almost
entirely
derive
a
subsistence
commence
at
this
place
these
appeared
to
be
unusually
gay
savages
fond
of
loud
laughter
and
in
their
apparent
good
nature
and
merry
character
struck
me
as
being
entirely
different
from
the
indians
we
had
been
accustomed
to
see
from
several
who
visited
our
camp
in
the
evening
we
purchased
in
exchange
for
goods
dried
salmon
at
this
season
they
are
not
very
fat
but
we
were
easily
pleased
the
indians
made
us
comprehend
that
when
the
salmon
came
up
the
river
in
the
spring
they
are
so
abundant
that
they
merely
throw
in
their
spears
at
random
certain
of
bringing
out
a
fish
these
poor
people
are
but
slightly
provided
with
winter
clothing
there
is
but
little
game
to
furnish
skins
for
the
purpose
and
of
a
little
animal
which
seemed
to
be
the
most
numerous
it
required
skins
to
make
a
covering
to
the
knees
but
they
are
still
a
joyous
talkative
race
who
grow
fat
and
become
poor
with
the
salmon
which
at
least
never
fail
them
the
dried
being
used
in
the
absence
of
the
fresh
we
are
encamped
immediately
on
the
river
bank
and
with
the
salmon
jumping
up
out
of
the
water
and
indians
paddling
about
in
boats
made
of
rushes
or
laughing
around
the
fires
the
camp
has
quite
a
lively
appearance
the
river
at
this
place
is
more
open
than
for
some
distance
above
and
for
the
time
the
black
precipices
have
disappeared
and
no
calcareous
matter
is
visible
in
the
soil
the
thermometer
at
sunset
clear
and
calm
the
sunrise
temperature
was
the
weather
clear
and
calm
shortly
after
leaving
the
encampment
we
crossed
a
stream
of
clear
water
with
a
variable
breadth
of
to
yards
broken
by
rapids
and
lightly
wooded
with
willow
and
having
a
little
grass
on
its
small
the
barrenness
of
the
country
is
in
fine
contrast
with
the
mingled
beauty
and
grandeur
of
the
river
which
is
more
open
than
hitherto
with
a
constant
succession
of
falls
and
rapids
over
the
edge
of
the
black
cliffs
and
out
from
their
faces
are
falling
numberless
streams
and
springs
and
all
the
line
of
the
river
is
in
motion
with
the
play
of
the
water
in
about
seven
miles
we
reached
the
most
beautiful
and
picturesque
fall
i
had
seen
on
the
river
on
the
opposite
side
the
vertical
fall
is
perhaps
feet
high
and
nearer
the
sheet
of
foaming
water
is
divided
and
broken
into
cataracts
where
several
little
islands
on
the
brink
and
in
the
river
above
give
it
much
picturesque
beauty
and
make
it
one
of
those
places
the
traveler
turns
again
and
again
to
fix
in
his
memory
there
were
several
lodges
of
indians
here
from
whom
we
traded
salmon
below
this
place
the
river
makes
a
remarkable
bend
and
the
road
ascending
the
ridge
gave
us
a
fine
view
of
the
river
below
intersected
at
many
places
by
numerous
fish
dams
in
the
north
about
miles
distant
were
some
high
snowy
peaks
of
the
salmon
river
mountains
and
in
the
northeast
the
last
peak
of
the
range
was
visible
at
the
distance
of
perhaps
miles
or
more
the
river
hills
consist
of
very
broken
masses
of
sand
covered
everywhere
with
the
same
interminable
fields
of
sage
and
occasionally
the
road
is
very
heavy
we
now
frequently
saw
indians
who
were
strung
along
the
river
at
every
little
rapid
where
fish
are
to
be
caught
and
the
cry
fish
was
constantly
heard
whenever
we
passed
near
their
huts
or
met
them
in
the
road
very
many
of
them
were
oddly
and
partially
dressed
in
overcoat
shirt
waistcoat
or
pantaloons
or
whatever
article
of
clothing
they
had
been
able
to
procure
in
trade
from
the
emigrants
for
we
had
now
entirely
quitted
the
country
where
hawks
bells
beads
and
vermilion
were
the
current
coin
and
found
that
here
only
useful
articles
and
chiefly
clothing
were
in
great
request
these
however
are
eagerly
sought
after
and
for
a
few
trifling
pieces
of
clothing
travelers
may
procure
food
sufficient
to
carry
them
to
the
columbia
we
made
a
long
stretch
across
the
upper
plain
and
encamped
on
the
bluff
where
the
grass
was
very
green
and
good
the
soil
of
the
upper
plains
containing
a
considerable
proportion
of
calcareous
matter
this
green
freshness
of
the
grass
was
very
remarkable
for
the
season
of
the
year
again
we
heard
the
roar
of
the
fall
in
the
river
below
where
the
water
in
an
unbroken
volume
goes
over
a
descent
of
several
feet
the
night
is
clear
and
the
weather
continues
very
warm
and
pleasant
with
a
sunset
temperature
of
the
morning
was
pleasant
with
a
temperature
at
sunrise
of
the
road
was
broken
by
ravines
among
the
hills
and
in
one
of
these
which
made
the
bed
of
a
dry
creek
i
found
a
fragmentary
stratum
or
brecciated
conglomerate
consisting
of
flinty
slate
pebbles
with
fragments
of
limestone
containing
fossil
shells
on
the
left
the
mountains
are
visible
at
the
distance
of
or
miles
appearing
smooth
and
rather
low
but
at
intervals
higher
peaks
look
out
from
beyond
and
indicate
that
the
main
ridge
which
we
are
leaving
with
the
course
of
the
river
and
which
forms
the
northern
boundary
of
the
great
basin
still
maintains
its
elevation
about
two
we
arrived
at
the
ford
where
the
road
crosses
to
the
right
bank
of
snake
river
an
indian
was
hired
to
conduct
us
through
the
ford
which
proved
impracticable
for
us
the
water
sweeping
away
the
howitzer
and
nearly
drowning
the
mules
which
we
were
obliged
to
extricate
by
cutting
them
out
of
the
harness
the
river
here
is
expanded
into
a
little
bay
in
which
there
are
two
islands
across
which
is
the
road
of
the
ford
and
the
emigrants
had
passed
by
placing
two
of
their
heavy
wagons
abreast
of
each
other
so
as
to
oppose
a
considerable
mass
against
the
body
of
water
the
indians
informed
us
that
one
of
the
men
in
attempting
to
turn
some
cattle
which
had
taken
a
wrong
direction
was
carried
off
by
the
current
and
drowned
since
their
passage
the
water
had
risen
considerably
but
fortunately
we
had
a
resource
in
a
boat
which
was
filled
with
air
and
launched
and
at
seven
we
were
safely
encamped
on
the
opposite
bank
the
animals
swimming
across
and
the
carriage
howitzer
and
baggage
of
the
camp
being
carried
over
in
the
boat
at
the
place
where
we
crossed
above
the
islands
the
river
had
narrowed
to
a
breadth
of
feet
by
measurement
the
greater
portion
of
which
was
from
six
to
eight
feet
deep
we
were
obliged
to
make
our
camp
where
we
landed
among
the
indian
lodges
which
are
semicircular
huts
made
of
willow
thatched
over
with
straw
and
open
to
the
sunny
south
by
observation
the
latitude
of
our
encampment
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
was
chronometric
longitude
and
the
traveled
distance
from
fort
hall
miles
calm
pleasant
day
with
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
at
leaving
the
river
at
a
considerable
distance
to
the
left
and
following
up
the
bed
of
a
rocky
creek
with
occasional
holes
of
water
in
about
six
miles
we
ascended
by
a
long
and
rather
steep
hill
to
a
plain
feet
above
the
river
over
which
we
continued
to
travel
during
the
day
having
a
broken
ridge
or
feet
high
on
the
right
the
plain
terminates
where
we
ascended
in
an
escarpment
of
vesicular
which
supplies
the
fragments
of
the
creek
below
the
sky
clouded
over
with
a
strong
wind
from
the
northwest
with
a
few
drops
of
rain
and
occasional
sunlight
threatening
a
change
artemisia
still
covers
the
plain
but
makes
its
appearance
here
on
the
and
on
bottoms
of
the
creeks
quite
a
tree
in
size
larger
than
the
artemisia
we
crossed
several
hollows
with
a
little
water
in
them
and
improved
grass
and
turning
off
from
the
road
in
the
afternoon
in
search
of
water
traveled
about
three
miles
up
the
bed
of
a
willow
creek
towards
the
mountain
and
found
a
good
encampment
with
wood
and
grass
and
little
ponds
of
water
in
the
bed
of
the
creek
which
must
be
of
more
importance
at
other
seasons
as
we
found
there
several
old
fixtures
for
fishing
there
were
many
holes
on
the
creek
prairie
which
had
been
made
by
the
diggers
in
search
of
roots
wind
increased
to
a
violent
gale
from
the
with
a
temperature
at
sunset
of
the
morning
was
calm
and
clear
and
at
sunrise
the
thermometer
was
at
the
road
was
occasionally
extremely
rocky
with
hard
volcanic
fragments
and
our
traveling
very
slow
in
about
nine
miles
the
road
brought
us
to
a
group
of
smoking
hot
springs
with
a
temperature
of
there
were
a
few
helianthi
in
bloom
with
some
other
low
plants
and
the
place
was
green
round
about
the
ground
warm
and
the
air
pleasant
with
a
summer
atmosphere
that
was
very
grateful
in
a
day
of
high
and
cold
searching
wind
the
rocks
were
covered
with
a
white
and
red
incrustation
and
the
water
has
on
the
tongue
the
same
unpleasant
effect
as
that
of
the
basin
spring
on
bear
river
they
form
several
branches
and
bubble
up
with
force
enough
to
raise
the
small
pebbles
several
inches
the
following
is
an
analysis
of
the
deposite
with
which
the
rocks
are
incrusted
silica
carbonate
of
lime
carbonate
of
magnesia
oxide
of
iron
alumina
chloride
of
sodium
sulphate
of
soda
sulphate
of
lime
organic
vegetable
water
and
loss
these
springs
are
near
the
foot
of
the
ridge
a
dark
and
mountain
in
which
some
of
the
nearer
rocks
have
a
reddish
appearance
and
probably
consist
of
a
trap
fragments
of
which
were
scattered
along
the
road
after
leaving
the
spring
the
road
was
now
about
to
cross
the
point
of
this
mountain
which
we
judged
to
be
a
spur
from
the
salmon
river
range
we
crossed
a
small
creek
and
encamped
about
sunset
on
a
stream
which
is
probably
lake
river
this
is
a
small
stream
some
five
or
six
feet
broad
with
a
swift
current
timbered
principally
with
willows
and
some
few
cottonwoods
along
the
banks
were
canes
rosebushes
and
clematis
with
purshia
tridentata
and
artemisias
on
the
upper
bottom
the
sombre
appearance
of
the
country
is
somewhat
relieved
in
coming
unexpectedly
from
the
dark
rocks
upon
these
green
and
wooded
sunk
in
chasms
and
in
the
spring
the
contrasted
effect
must
make
them
beautiful
the
thermometer
at
sunset
and
the
night
threatening
snow
the
morning
warm
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
and
sky
entirely
clouded
after
traveling
about
three
miles
over
an
extremely
rocky
road
the
volcanic
fragments
began
to
disappear
and
entering
among
the
hills
at
the
point
of
the
mountain
we
found
ourselves
suddenly
in
a
granite
country
here
the
character
of
the
vegetation
was
very
much
changed
the
artemisia
disappeared
almost
entirely
showing
only
at
intervals
towards
the
close
of
the
day
and
was
replaced
by
purshia
tridentata
with
flowering
shrubs
and
small
fields
of
divaricata
which
gave
bloom
and
gayety
to
the
hills
these
were
everywhere
covered
with
a
fresh
and
green
short
grass
like
that
of
the
early
spring
this
is
the
fall
or
second
growth
the
dried
grass
having
been
burnt
off
by
the
indians
and
wherever
the
fire
has
passed
the
bright
green
color
is
universal
the
soil
among
the
hills
is
altogether
different
from
that
of
the
river
plain
being
in
many
places
black
in
others
sandy
and
gravelly
but
of
a
firm
and
good
character
appearing
to
result
from
the
decomposition
of
the
granite
rocks
which
is
proceeding
rapidly
in
quitting
for
a
time
the
artemisia
sage
through
which
we
had
been
so
long
voyaging
and
the
sombre
appearance
of
which
is
so
discouraging
i
have
to
remark
that
i
have
been
informed
that
in
mexico
wheat
is
grown
upon
the
ground
which
produces
this
shrub
which
if
true
relieves
the
soil
from
the
character
of
sterility
imputed
to
it
be
this
as
it
may
there
is
no
dispute
about
the
grass
which
is
almost
universal
on
the
hills
and
mountains
and
always
nutritious
even
in
its
dry
state
we
passed
on
the
way
masses
of
granite
on
the
slope
of
the
spur
which
was
very
much
weathered
and
abraded
this
is
a
white
feldspathic
granite
with
small
scales
of
black
mica
smoky
quartz
and
garnets
appear
to
constitute
this
portion
of
the
mountain
the
road
at
noon
reached
a
broken
ridge
on
which
were
scattered
many
boulders
or
blocks
of
granite
and
passing
very
small
streams
where
with
a
little
more
than
the
usual
timber
was
sometimes
gathered
a
little
wilderness
of
plants
we
encamped
on
a
small
stream
after
a
march
of
miles
in
company
with
a
few
indians
temperature
at
sunset
and
the
night
was
partially
clear
with
a
few
stars
visible
through
drifting
white
clouds
the
indians
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
steal
a
few
horses
from
us
a
thing
of
course
with
them
and
to
prevent
which
the
traveler
is
on
perpetual
watch
the
day
was
bright
clear
pleasant
with
a
temperature
of
and
we
breakfasted
at
sunrise
the
birds
singing
in
the
trees
as
merrily
as
if
we
were
in
the
midst
of
summer
on
the
upper
edge
of
the
hills
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
creek
the
black
volcanic
rock
appears
and
ascending
these
the
road
passed
through
a
basin
around
which
the
hills
swept
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
it
the
appearance
of
an
old
crater
here
were
strata
and
broken
beds
of
black
scoriated
rock
and
hills
composed
of
the
same
on
the
summit
of
one
of
which
there
was
an
opening
resembling
a
rent
we
traveled
through
a
country
resembling
that
of
yesterday
where
although
the
surface
was
hilly
the
road
was
good
being
firm
and
entirely
free
from
rocks
and
artemisia
to
our
left
below
was
the
great
sage
plain
and
on
the
right
were
the
near
mountains
which
presented
a
character
or
rather
a
surface
waved
into
numberless
hills
the
road
was
occasionally
enlivened
by
meeting
indians
and
the
day
was
extremely
beautiful
and
pleasant
and
we
were
pleased
to
be
free
from
the
sage
even
for
a
day
when
we
had
traveled
about
eight
miles
we
were
nearly
opposite
to
the
highest
portion
of
the
mountains
on
the
left
side
of
the
smoke
river
valley
and
continuing
on
a
few
miles
beyond
we
came
suddenly
in
sight
of
the
broad
green
line
of
the
valley
of
the
wooded
river
black
near
the
gorge
where
it
debouches
into
the
plains
with
high
precipices
of
basalt
between
walls
of
which
it
passes
on
emerging
from
the
mountains
following
with
the
eye
its
upward
course
it
appears
to
be
shut
in
among
lofty
mountains
confining
its
valley
in
a
very
rugged
country
descending
the
hills
after
traveling
a
few
miles
along
the
high
plain
the
road
brought
us
down
upon
the
bottoms
of
the
river
which
is
a
beautiful
rapid
stream
with
clear
mountain
water
and
as
the
name
indicates
well
wooded
with
some
varieties
of
timber
among
which
are
handsome
cottonwoods
such
a
stream
had
become
quite
a
novelty
in
this
country
and
we
were
delighted
this
afternoon
to
make
a
pleasant
camp
under
fine
old
trees
again
there
were
several
indian
encampments
scattered
along
the
river
and
a
number
of
their
inhabitants
in
the
course
of
the
evening
came
to
the
camp
on
horseback
with
dried
and
fresh
fish
to
trade
the
evening
was
clear
and
the
temperature
at
sunset
at
the
time
of
the
first
occupation
of
this
region
by
parties
engaged
in
the
a
small
party
of
men
under
the
command
of
reid
constituting
all
the
garrison
of
a
small
fort
on
this
river
were
surprised
and
massacred
by
the
indians
and
to
this
event
the
stream
owes
its
occasional
name
of
on
the
we
traveled
about
miles
the
ridge
on
the
right
having
scattered
pines
on
the
upper
parts
and
continuing
the
next
day
our
road
along
the
river
bottom
after
a
day
travel
of
miles
we
encamped
in
the
evening
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
a
mile
above
the
mouth
and
early
the
next
morning
arrived
at
fort
this
is
a
simple
on
the
right
bank
of
snake
river
about
a
mile
below
the
mouth
of
rivière
boisée
and
on
our
arrival
we
were
received
with
an
agreeable
hospitality
by
payette
an
officer
of
the
hudson
bay
company
in
charge
of
the
fort
all
of
whose
garrison
consisted
in
a
canadian
here
the
road
recrosses
the
river
which
is
broad
and
deep
but
with
our
good
boat
aided
by
two
canoes
which
were
found
at
the
place
the
camp
was
very
soon
transferred
to
the
left
bank
here
we
found
ourselves
again
surrounded
by
the
sage
artemisia
tridentata
and
the
different
shrubs
which
during
our
voyage
had
always
made
their
appearance
abundantly
on
saline
soils
being
here
the
prevailing
and
almost
the
only
plants
among
them
the
surface
was
covered
with
the
usual
saline
efflorescences
which
here
consist
almost
entirely
of
carbonate
of
soda
with
a
small
portion
of
chloride
of
sodium
payette
had
made
but
slight
attempts
at
cultivation
his
efforts
being
limited
to
raising
a
few
vegetables
in
which
he
succeeded
tolerably
well
the
post
being
principally
supported
by
salmon
he
was
very
hospitable
and
kind
to
us
and
we
made
a
sensible
impression
upon
all
his
comestibles
but
our
principal
inroad
was
into
the
dairy
which
was
abundantly
supplied
stock
appearing
to
thrive
extremely
well
and
we
had
an
unusual
luxury
in
a
present
of
fresh
butter
which
was
however
by
no
means
equal
to
that
of
fort
hall
probably
from
some
accidental
cause
during
the
day
we
remained
here
there
were
considerable
numbers
of
miserable
indians
around
the
fort
who
had
arrived
from
the
neighboring
mountains
during
the
summer
the
only
subsistence
of
these
people
is
derived
from
the
salmon
of
which
they
are
not
provident
enough
to
lay
up
a
sufficient
store
for
the
winter
during
which
many
of
them
die
from
absolute
starvation
many
little
accounts
and
scattered
histories
together
with
an
acquaintance
which
i
gradually
acquired
of
their
modes
of
life
had
left
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
this
vast
region
pictured
in
my
mind
as
a
race
of
people
whose
great
and
constant
occupation
was
the
means
of
procuring
a
subsistence
and
though
want
of
space
and
other
reasons
will
prevent
me
from
detailing
the
many
incidents
which
made
this
familiar
to
me
this
great
feature
among
the
characteristics
of
the
country
will
gradually
be
forced
upon
your
mind
pointing
to
the
group
of
indians
who
had
just
arrived
from
the
mountains
on
the
left
side
of
the
valley
and
who
were
regarding
our
usual
appliances
of
civilization
with
an
air
of
bewildered
curiosity
payette
informed
me
that
every
year
since
his
arrival
at
this
post
he
had
unsuccessfully
endeavored
to
induce
these
people
to
lay
up
a
store
of
salmon
for
their
winter
provision
while
the
summer
weather
and
the
salmon
lasted
they
lived
contentedly
and
happily
scattered
along
the
different
streams
where
fish
are
to
be
found
and
as
soon
as
the
winter
snows
began
to
fall
little
smokes
would
be
seen
rising
among
the
mountains
where
they
would
be
found
in
miserable
groups
starving
out
the
winter
and
sometimes
according
to
the
general
belief
reduced
to
the
horror
of
cannibalism
the
strong
of
course
preying
on
the
weak
certain
it
is
they
are
driven
to
any
extremity
for
food
and
eat
every
insect
and
every
creeping
thing
however
loathsome
and
repulsive
snails
lizards
ants
all
are
devoured
with
the
readiness
and
greediness
of
mere
animals
in
common
with
all
the
other
indians
we
had
encountered
since
reaching
the
pacific
waters
these
people
use
the
shoshonee
or
snake
language
which
you
will
have
occasion
to
remark
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
is
the
universal
language
over
a
very
extensive
region
on
the
evening
of
the
i
obtained
with
the
usual
observations
a
very
excellent
emersion
of
the
first
satellite
agreeing
very
nearly
with
the
chronometer
from
these
observations
the
longitude
of
the
fort
is
latitude
and
elevation
above
the
sea
feet
sitting
by
the
fire
on
the
river
bank
and
waiting
for
the
immersion
of
the
satellite
which
did
not
take
place
until
after
midnight
we
heard
the
monotonous
song
of
the
indians
with
which
they
accompany
a
certain
game
of
which
they
are
very
fond
of
the
poetry
we
could
not
judge
but
the
music
was
miserable
the
morning
was
clear
with
a
light
breeze
from
the
east
and
a
temperature
at
sunrise
of
a
part
of
a
bullock
purchased
at
the
fort
together
with
the
boat
to
assist
him
in
crossing
was
left
here
for
fitzpatrick
and
at
we
resumed
our
journey
and
directly
leaving
the
river
and
crossing
the
artemisia
plain
in
several
ascents
we
reached
the
foot
of
a
ridge
where
the
road
entered
a
dry
sandy
hollow
up
which
it
continued
to
the
head
and
crossing
a
dividing
ridge
entered
a
similar
one
we
met
here
two
poor
emigrants
irishmen
who
had
lost
their
horses
two
days
since
probably
stolen
by
the
indians
and
were
returning
to
the
fort
in
hopes
to
hear
something
of
them
there
they
had
recently
had
nothing
to
eat
and
i
halted
to
unpack
an
animal
and
gave
them
meat
for
their
dinner
in
this
hollow
the
artemisia
is
partially
displaced
on
the
by
grass
and
descending
it
miles
about
sunset
we
reached
the
aux
the
unfortunate
or
unlucky
river
a
considerable
stream
with
an
average
breadth
of
feet
and
at
this
time
inches
depth
of
water
the
bottom
lands
were
generally
one
and
a
half
mile
broad
covered
principally
with
long
dry
grass
and
we
had
difficulty
to
find
sufficient
good
grass
for
the
camp
with
the
exception
of
a
bad
place
of
a
few
hundred
yards
long
which
occurred
in
rounding
a
point
of
hill
to
reach
the
ford
of
the
river
the
road
during
the
day
had
been
very
good
the
morning
was
clear
and
calm
and
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
my
attention
was
attracted
by
a
smoke
on
the
right
side
of
the
river
a
little
below
the
ford
where
i
found
on
the
low
banks
near
the
water
a
considerable
number
of
hot
springs
in
which
the
temperature
of
the
water
was
the
ground
which
was
too
hot
for
the
naked
foot
was
covered
above
and
below
the
springs
with
an
incrustation
of
common
salt
very
white
and
good
and
leading
for
five
miles
up
a
broad
dry
branch
of
the
malheurs
river
the
road
entered
a
sandy
hollow
where
the
surface
was
rendered
firm
by
the
admixture
of
other
rock
being
good
and
level
until
arriving
near
the
head
of
the
ravine
where
it
became
a
little
rocky
and
we
met
with
a
number
of
sharp
ascents
over
an
undulating
surface
crossing
here
a
dividing
ridge
it
becomes
an
excellent
road
of
gradual
descent
down
a
very
marked
hollow
in
which
after
ten
miles
willows
began
to
appear
in
the
dry
bed
of
a
head
of
the
aux
birch
river
and
descending
seven
miles
we
found
at
its
junction
with
another
branch
a
little
water
not
very
good
or
abundant
but
sufficient
in
case
of
necessity
for
a
camp
crossing
birch
river
we
continued
for
about
four
miles
across
a
point
of
hill
the
country
on
the
left
being
entirely
mountainous
with
no
level
spot
to
be
seen
whence
we
descended
to
snake
river
here
a
stream
with
a
large
body
of
water
and
a
smooth
current
although
we
hear
the
roar
and
see
below
us
the
commencement
of
rapids
where
it
enters
among
the
hills
it
forms
here
a
deep
bay
with
a
low
sand
island
in
the
midst
and
its
course
among
the
mountains
is
agreeably
exchanged
for
the
black
volcanic
rock
the
weather
during
the
day
had
been
very
bright
and
extremely
hot
but
as
usual
so
soon
as
the
sun
went
down
it
was
necessary
to
put
on
overcoats
i
obtained
this
evening
an
observation
of
an
emersion
of
the
first
satellite
and
our
observations
of
the
evening
place
this
encampment
in
latitude
and
longitude
which
is
the
mean
of
the
results
from
the
satellite
and
chronometer
the
elevation
above
the
sea
is
feet
at
this
encampment
the
grass
is
scanty
and
poor
the
morning
was
bright
with
the
temperature
at
sunrise
the
horses
had
strayed
off
during
the
night
probably
in
search
of
grass
and
after
a
considerable
delay
we
had
succeeded
in
finding
all
but
two
when
about
nine
we
heard
the
sound
of
an
indian
song
and
drum
approaching
and
shortly
after
three
cayuse
indians
appeared
in
sight
bringing
with
them
the
two
animals
they
belonged
to
a
party
which
had
been
on
a
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
were
hurrying
home
in
advance
we
presented
them
with
some
tobacco
and
other
things
with
which
they
appeared
well
satisfied
and
moderating
their
pace
traveled
in
company
with
us
we
were
now
about
to
leave
the
valley
of
the
great
southern
branch
of
the
columbia
river
to
which
the
absence
of
timber
and
the
scarcity
of
water
give
the
appearance
of
a
desert
to
enter
a
mountainous
region
where
the
soil
is
good
and
in
which
the
face
of
the
country
is
covered
with
nutritious
grasses
and
dense
forest
land
embracing
many
varieties
of
trees
peculiar
to
the
country
and
on
which
the
timber
exhibits
a
luxuriance
of
growth
unknown
to
the
eastern
part
of
the
continent
and
to
europe
this
mountainous
region
connects
itself
in
the
southward
and
westward
with
the
elevated
country
belonging
to
the
cascade
or
california
range
and
as
will
be
remarked
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
forms
the
eastern
limit
of
the
fertile
and
timbered
lands
along
the
desert
and
mountainous
region
included
within
the
great
basin
a
term
which
i
apply
to
the
intermediate
region
between
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
next
range
containing
many
lakes
with
their
own
system
of
rivers
and
creeks
of
which
the
great
salt
is
the
principal
and
which
have
no
connection
with
the
ocean
or
the
great
rivers
which
flow
into
it
this
great
basin
is
yet
to
be
adequately
explored
and
here
on
quitting
the
banks
of
a
sterile
river
to
enter
on
arable
mountains
the
remark
may
be
made
that
on
this
western
slope
of
our
continent
the
usual
order
or
distribution
of
good
and
bad
soil
is
often
reversed
the
river
and
creek
bottoms
being
often
sterile
and
darkened
with
the
gloomy
and
barren
artemisia
while
the
mountain
is
often
fertile
and
covered
with
rich
grass
pleasant
to
the
eye
and
good
for
flocks
and
herds
leaving
entirely
the
snake
river
which
is
said
henceforth
to
pursue
its
way
through
canons
amidst
rocky
and
impracticable
mountains
where
there
is
no
possibility
of
traveling
with
animals
we
ascended
a
long
and
steep
hill
and
crossing
the
dividing
ridge
came
down
into
the
valley
of
river
which
here
looks
like
a
hole
among
the
hills
the
average
breadth
of
the
stream
here
is
thirty
feet
it
is
well
fringed
with
the
usual
small
timber
and
the
soil
in
the
bottoms
is
good
with
better
grass
than
we
had
lately
been
accustomed
to
see
we
now
traveled
through
a
very
mountainous
country
the
stream
running
rather
in
a
ravine
than
a
valley
and
the
road
is
decidedly
bad
and
dangerous
for
single
wagons
frequently
crossing
the
stream
where
the
water
is
sometimes
deep
and
all
the
day
the
animals
were
fatigued
in
climbing
up
and
descending
a
succession
of
steep
ascents
to
avoid
the
precipitous
and
the
common
trail
which
leads
along
the
at
places
where
the
river
strikes
the
base
is
sometimes
bad
even
for
a
horseman
the
mountains
along
this
day
journey
were
composed
near
the
river
of
a
slaty
calcareous
rock
in
a
metamorphic
condition
it
appears
originally
to
have
been
a
slaty
sedimentary
limestone
but
its
present
condition
indicates
that
it
has
been
altered
and
has
become
partially
crystalline
probably
from
the
proximity
of
volcanic
rocks
but
though
traveling
was
slow
and
fatiguing
to
the
animals
we
were
delighted
with
the
appearance
of
the
country
which
was
green
and
refreshing
after
our
tedious
journey
down
the
parched
valley
of
snake
river
the
mountains
were
covered
with
good
the
water
of
the
streams
was
cold
and
pure
their
bottoms
were
handsomely
wooded
with
various
kinds
of
trees
and
huge
and
lofty
picturesque
precipices
where
the
river
cut
through
the
mountain
we
found
in
the
evening
some
good
grass
and
rushes
and
encamped
among
large
timber
principally
birch
which
had
been
recently
burnt
and
blackened
and
almost
destroyed
by
fire
the
night
was
calm
and
tolerably
clear
with
the
thermometer
at
sunset
at
our
journey
was
about
twenty
miles
the
day
was
clear
and
calm
with
a
temperature
at
sunrise
of
after
traveling
about
three
miles
up
the
valley
we
found
the
river
shut
up
by
precipices
in
a
kind
of
canon
and
the
road
makes
a
circuit
over
the
mountains
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
the
river
again
by
another
little
ravine
and
after
traveling
along
it
for
a
few
miles
left
it
enclosed
among
rude
mountains
and
ascending
a
smaller
branch
encamped
on
it
about
five
very
much
elevated
above
the
valley
the
view
was
everywhere
limited
by
mountains
on
which
were
no
longer
seen
the
black
and
barren
rocks
but
a
fertile
soil
with
excellent
grass
and
partly
well
covered
with
pine
i
have
never
seen
a
equally
bad
in
the
same
space
as
this
of
yesterday
and
i
noticed
where
one
wagon
had
been
overturned
twice
in
a
very
short
distance
and
it
was
surprising
to
me
that
those
wagons
which
were
in
the
rear
and
could
not
have
had
much
assistance
got
through
at
all
still
there
is
no
mud
and
the
road
has
one
advantage
in
being
perfectly
firm
the
day
had
been
warm
and
very
pleasant
and
the
night
was
perfectly
clear
the
thermometer
at
daylight
was
and
at
sunrise
clouds
which
were
scattered
over
all
the
sky
disappeared
with
the
rising
sun
the
trail
did
not
much
improve
until
we
had
crossed
the
between
the
burnt
and
powder
rivers
the
rock
displayed
on
the
mountains
as
we
approached
the
summit
was
a
compact
trap
decomposed
on
the
exposed
surfaces
and
apparently
an
altered
argillaceous
sandstone
containing
small
crystalline
nodules
of
anolcime
apparently
filling
cavities
originally
existing
from
the
summit
here
the
whole
horizon
shows
high
mountains
no
high
plain
or
level
is
to
be
seen
and
on
the
left
from
south
around
by
the
west
to
north
the
mountains
are
black
with
pines
while
through
the
remaining
space
to
the
eastward
they
are
bald
with
the
exception
of
some
scattered
pines
you
will
remark
that
we
are
now
entering
a
region
where
all
the
elevated
parts
are
covered
with
dense
and
heavy
forests
from
the
dividing
grounds
we
descended
by
a
mountain
road
to
powder
river
on
an
old
bed
of
which
we
encamped
descending
from
the
summit
we
enjoyed
a
picturesque
view
of
high
rocky
mountains
on
the
right
illuminated
by
the
setting
sun
from
the
heights
we
had
looked
in
vain
for
a
well
known
landmark
on
powder
river
which
had
been
described
to
me
by
payette
as
the
lone
tree
and
on
arriving
at
the
river
we
found
a
fine
tall
pine
stretched
on
the
ground
which
had
been
felled
by
some
inconsiderate
emigrant
axe
it
had
been
a
beacon
on
the
road
for
many
years
past
our
cayuses
had
become
impatient
to
reach
their
homes
and
traveled
on
ahead
to
day
and
this
afternoon
we
were
visited
by
several
indians
who
belonged
to
the
tribes
on
the
columbia
they
were
on
horseback
and
were
out
on
a
hunting
excursion
but
had
obtained
no
better
game
than
a
large
gray
hare
of
which
each
had
some
six
or
seven
hanging
to
his
saddle
we
were
also
visited
by
an
indian
who
had
his
lodge
and
family
in
the
mountain
to
the
left
he
was
in
want
of
ammunition
and
brought
with
him
a
to
exchange
and
which
he
valued
at
six
charges
of
powder
and
ball
i
learned
from
him
that
there
are
very
few
of
these
animals
remaining
in
this
part
of
the
country
the
temperature
at
sunset
was
and
the
evening
clear
i
obtained
with
other
observations
an
immersion
and
emersion
of
the
third
satellite
elevation
feet
for
several
weeks
the
weather
in
the
daytime
has
been
very
beautiful
clear
and
warm
but
the
nights
in
comparison
are
very
cold
during
the
night
there
was
ice
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
in
the
lodge
and
at
daylight
the
thermometer
was
at
and
the
same
at
sunrise
the
weather
being
calm
and
clear
the
annual
vegetation
now
is
nearly
gone
almost
all
the
plants
being
out
of
bloom
last
night
two
of
our
horses
had
run
off
again
which
delayed
us
until
noon
and
we
made
but
a
short
journey
of
miles
the
road
being
very
good
and
encamped
in
a
fine
bottom
of
powder
river
the
thermometer
at
sunset
was
at
with
an
easterly
wind
and
partially
clear
sky
and
the
day
has
been
quite
pleasant
and
warm
though
more
cloudy
than
yesterday
and
the
sun
was
frequently
faint
but
it
grew
finer
and
clearer
towards
evening
thermometer
at
sunrise
the
weather
at
daylight
was
fine
and
the
sky
without
a
cloud
but
these
came
up
or
were
formed
by
the
sun
and
at
seven
were
thick
over
all
the
sky
just
now
this
appears
to
be
the
regular
course
clear
and
brilliant
during
the
night
and
cloudy
during
the
day
there
is
snow
yet
visible
in
the
neighboring
mountains
which
yesterday
extended
along
our
route
to
the
left
in
a
lofty
and
range
having
much
the
appearance
of
the
wind
river
mountains
it
is
probable
that
they
have
received
their
name
of
the
from
the
appearance
given
to
them
by
the
pines
we
traveled
this
morning
across
the
affluents
to
powder
river
the
road
being
good
firm
and
level
and
the
country
became
constantly
more
pleasant
and
interesting
the
soil
appeared
to
be
very
deep
and
is
black
and
extremely
good
as
well
among
the
hollows
of
the
hills
on
the
elevated
plats
as
on
the
river
bottoms
the
vegetation
being
such
as
is
usually
found
in
good
ground
the
following
analytical
result
shows
the
precise
qualities
of
this
soil
and
will
justify
to
science
the
character
of
fertility
which
the
eye
attributes
to
it
of
powder
river
silica
alumina
carbonate
of
lime
carbonate
of
magnesia
oxide
of
iron
organic
matter
water
and
loss
from
the
waters
of
this
stream
the
road
ascended
by
a
good
and
moderate
ascent
to
a
dividing
ridge
but
immediately
entered
upon
ground
covered
with
fragments
of
an
altered
silicious
slate
which
are
in
many
places
large
and
render
the
road
racking
to
a
carriage
in
this
rock
the
planes
of
deposition
are
distinctly
preserved
and
the
metamorphism
is
evidently
due
to
the
proximity
of
volcanic
rocks
on
either
side
the
mountains
here
are
densely
covered
with
tall
and
handsome
trees
and
mingled
with
the
green
of
a
variety
of
pines
is
the
yellow
of
the
european
larch
which
loses
its
leaves
in
the
fall
from
its
present
color
we
were
enabled
to
see
that
it
forms
a
large
proportion
of
the
forests
on
the
mountains
and
is
here
a
magnificent
tree
attaining
sometimes
the
height
of
feet
which
i
believe
is
elsewhere
unknown
about
two
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
a
high
point
of
the
dividing
ridge
from
which
we
obtained
a
good
view
of
the
a
beautiful
level
basin
or
mountain
valley
covered
with
good
grass
on
a
rich
soil
abundantly
watered
and
surrounded
by
high
and
mountains
and
its
name
descriptive
of
its
form
the
great
circle
it
is
a
place
one
of
the
few
we
have
seen
on
our
journey
so
far
where
a
farmer
would
delight
to
establish
himself
if
he
were
content
to
live
in
the
seclusion
which
it
imposes
it
is
about
miles
in
diameter
and
may
in
time
form
a
superb
county
probably
with
the
view
of
avoiding
a
circuit
the
wagons
had
directly
descended
into
the
by
the
face
of
a
hill
so
very
rocky
and
continuously
steep
as
to
be
apparently
impracticable
and
following
down
on
their
trail
we
encamped
on
one
of
the
branches
of
the
grand
rond
river
immediately
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
i
had
remarked
in
descending
some
very
white
spots
glistening
on
the
plain
and
going
out
in
that
direction
after
we
had
encamped
i
found
them
to
be
the
bed
of
a
dry
salt
lake
or
marsh
very
firm
and
bare
which
was
covered
thickly
with
a
fine
white
powder
containing
a
large
quantity
of
carbonate
of
soda
in
one
hundred
parts
the
old
grass
had
been
lately
burnt
off
from
the
surrounding
hills
and
wherever
the
fire
had
passed
there
was
a
recent
growth
of
strong
green
and
vigorous
grass
and
the
soil
of
the
level
prairie
which
sweeps
directly
up
to
the
foot
of
the
surrounding
mountains
appears
to
be
very
rich
producing
flax
spontaneously
and
luxuriantly
in
various
places
of
grand
rond
silica
alumina
lime
and
magnesia
oxide
of
iron
vegetable
matter
partly
decomposed
water
and
loss
phosphate
of
lime
the
elevation
of
this
encampment
is
feet
above
the
sea
it
began
to
rain
an
hour
before
sunrise
and
continued
until
ten
the
sky
entirely
overcast
and
the
temperature
at
sunrise
we
resumed
our
journey
somewhat
later
than
usual
travelling
in
a
nearly
north
direction
across
the
beautiful
valley
and
about
noon
reached
a
place
on
one
of
the
principal
streams
where
i
had
determined
to
leave
the
emigrant
trail
in
the
expectation
of
finding
a
more
direct
and
better
road
across
the
blue
mountains
at
this
place
the
emigrants
appeared
to
have
held
some
consultation
as
to
their
further
route
and
finally
turned
directly
off
to
the
left
reaching
the
foot
of
the
mountain
in
about
three
miles
which
they
ascended
by
a
hill
as
steep
and
difficult
as
that
by
which
we
had
yesterday
descended
to
the
rond
quitting
therefore
this
road
which
after
a
very
rough
crossing
issues
from
the
mountains
by
the
heads
of
the
river
we
continued
our
northern
course
across
the
valley
following
an
indian
trail
which
had
been
indicated
to
me
by
payette
and
encamped
at
the
northern
extremity
of
the
grand
rond
on
a
stream
of
very
deep
water
without
any
apparent
current
there
are
some
pines
here
on
the
low
hills
at
the
creek
and
in
the
northwest
corner
of
the
rond
is
a
very
heavy
body
of
timber
which
descends
into
the
plain
the
clouds
which
had
rested
very
low
along
the
mountain
sides
during
the
day
rose
gradually
up
in
the
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
the
sky
was
almost
entirely
clear
with
a
temperature
at
sunset
of
some
indifferent
observations
placed
the
camp
in
longitude
latitude
and
the
elevation
was
feet
above
the
sea
this
morning
the
mountains
were
hidden
by
fog
there
was
a
heavy
dew
during
the
night
in
which
the
exposed
thermometer
at
daylight
stood
at
and
at
sunrise
the
temperature
was
we
passed
out
of
the
grand
rond
by
a
fine
road
along
the
creek
which
for
a
short
distance
runs
in
a
kind
of
rocky
chasm
crossing
a
low
point
which
was
a
little
rocky
the
trail
conducted
into
the
open
valley
of
the
stream
a
handsome
place
for
farms
the
soil
even
of
the
hills
being
rich
and
black
passing
through
a
point
of
pines
which
bore
evidences
of
being
very
much
frequented
by
the
indians
and
in
which
the
trees
were
sometimes
apparently
feet
high
and
three
to
seven
feet
in
diameter
we
halted
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
afternoon
at
the
foot
of
the
blue
mountains
on
a
branch
of
the
grand
rond
river
at
an
elevation
of
feet
resuming
our
journey
we
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
mountains
through
an
open
pine
forest
of
large
and
stately
trees
among
which
the
balsam
pine
made
its
appearance
the
road
being
good
with
the
exception
of
one
steep
ascent
with
a
corresponding
descent
which
might
both
have
been
easily
avoided
by
opening
the
way
for
a
short
distance
through
the
timber
it
would
have
been
well
had
we
encamped
on
the
stream
where
we
had
halted
below
as
the
night
overtook
us
on
the
mountain
and
we
were
obliged
to
encamp
without
water
and
tie
up
the
animals
to
the
trees
for
the
night
we
halted
on
a
smooth
open
place
of
a
narrow
ridge
which
descended
very
rapidly
to
a
ravine
or
piny
hollow
at
a
considerable
distance
below
and
it
was
quite
a
pretty
spot
had
there
been
water
near
but
the
fires
at
night
look
very
cheerless
after
a
day
march
when
there
is
no
preparation
for
supper
going
on
and
after
sitting
some
time
around
the
blazing
logs
preuss
and
carson
with
several
others
volunteered
to
take
the
buckets
and
go
down
into
the
ravine
in
search
of
water
it
was
a
very
difficult
way
in
the
darkness
down
the
slippery
side
of
the
steep
mountain
and
harder
still
to
climb
about
half
a
mile
up
again
but
they
found
the
water
and
the
cup
of
coffee
which
it
enabled
us
to
make
and
bread
were
only
enjoyed
with
greater
pleasure
at
sunset
the
temperature
was
the
evening
remarkably
clear
and
i
obtained
an
emersion
of
the
first
satellite
which
does
not
give
a
good
result
although
the
observation
was
a
very
good
one
the
chronometric
longitude
was
latitude
and
we
had
ascended
to
an
elevation
of
feet
it
appeared
to
have
snowed
yesterday
on
the
mountains
their
summits
showing
very
white
there
was
a
heavy
white
frost
during
the
night
and
at
sunrise
the
temperature
was
the
animals
had
eaten
nothing
during
the
night
and
we
made
an
early
start
continuing
our
route
among
the
pines
which
were
more
dense
than
yesterday
and
still
retained
their
magnificent
size
the
larches
cluster
together
in
masses
on
the
side
of
the
mountains
and
their
yellow
foliage
contrasts
handsomely
with
the
green
of
the
balsam
and
other
pines
after
a
few
miles
we
ceased
to
see
any
pines
and
the
timber
consisted
of
several
varieties
of
spruce
larch
and
balsam
pine
which
have
a
regularly
conical
figure
these
trees
appeared
from
to
nearly
feet
in
height
the
usual
circumference
being
to
feet
and
in
the
pines
sometimes
feet
in
open
places
near
the
summit
these
trees
became
less
high
and
more
branching
the
conical
form
having
a
greater
base
the
instrument
carriage
occasioned
much
delay
it
being
frequently
necessary
to
fell
trees
and
remove
the
fallen
timber
the
trail
we
were
following
led
up
a
long
spur
with
a
very
gradual
and
gentle
rise
at
the
end
of
three
miles
we
halted
at
an
open
place
near
the
summit
from
which
we
enjoyed
a
fine
view
over
the
mountainous
country
where
we
had
lately
traveled
to
take
a
barometrical
observation
at
the
height
of
feet
after
traveling
occasionally
through
open
places
in
the
forest
we
were
obliged
to
cut
a
way
through
a
dense
body
of
timber
from
which
we
emerged
on
an
open
where
we
found
a
number
of
small
springs
and
encamped
after
a
day
journey
of
ten
miles
our
elevation
here
was
feet
there
was
a
very
heavy
white
frost
during
the
night
and
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
was
we
continued
to
travel
through
the
forest
in
which
the
road
was
rendered
difficult
by
fallen
trunks
and
obstructed
by
many
small
trees
which
it
was
necessary
to
cut
down
but
these
are
only
accidental
difficulties
which
could
easily
be
removed
and
a
very
excellent
road
may
be
had
through
this
pass
with
no
other
than
very
moderate
ascents
or
declivities
a
laborious
day
which
had
advanced
us
only
six
miles
on
the
road
brought
us
in
the
afternoon
to
an
opening
in
the
forest
in
which
there
was
a
fine
mountain
meadow
with
good
grass
and
a
large
stream
one
of
the
head
branches
of
the
river
during
this
day
journey
the
barometer
was
broken
and
the
elevations
above
the
sea
hereafter
given
depend
upon
the
temperature
of
boiling
water
some
of
the
white
spruces
which
i
measured
were
twelve
feet
in
circumference
and
one
of
the
larches
ten
but
eight
feet
was
the
average
circumference
of
those
measured
along
the
road
i
held
in
my
hand
a
tape
line
as
i
walked
along
in
order
to
form
some
correct
idea
of
the
size
of
the
timber
their
height
appeared
to
be
from
to
and
perhaps
feet
and
the
trunks
of
the
larches
were
sometimes
feet
without
a
limb
but
the
white
spruces
were
generally
covered
with
branches
nearly
to
the
root
all
these
trees
have
their
branches
particularly
the
lower
ones
declining
the
white
frost
this
morning
was
like
snow
on
the
ground
the
ice
was
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
on
the
creek
and
the
thermometer
at
sunrise
was
at
but
in
a
few
hours
the
day
became
warm
and
pleasant
and
our
road
over
the
mountains
was
delightful
and
full
of
enjoyment
the
trail
passed
sometimes
through
very
thick
young
timber
in
which
there
was
much
cutting
to
be
done
but
after
traveling
a
few
miles
the
mountains
became
more
bald
and
we
reached
a
point
from
which
there
was
a
very
extensive
view
in
the
northwest
we
were
on
the
western
verge
of
the
blue
mountains
long
spurs
of
which
very
precipitous
on
either
side
extended
down
into
the
valley
the
waters
of
the
mountain
roaring
between
them
on
our
right
was
a
mountain
plateau
covered
with
a
dense
forest
and
to
the
westward
immediately
below
us
was
the
great
pierced
nose
prairie
in
which
dark
lines
of
timber
indicated
the
course
of
many
affluents
to
a
considerable
stream
that
was
pursuing
its
way
across
the
plain
towards
what
appeared
to
be
the
columbia
river
this
i
knew
to
be
the
walahwalah
river
and
occasional
spots
along
its
banks
which
resembled
clearings
were
supposed
to
be
the
mission
or
indian
settlements
but
the
weather
was
smoky
and
unfavorable
to
far
views
with
the
glass
the
rock
displayed
here
in
the
escarpments
is
a
compact
amorphous
trap
which
appears
to
constitute
the
mass
of
the
blue
mountains
in
this
latitude
and
all
the
region
of
country
through
which
we
have
traveled
since
leaving
the
snake
river
has
been
the
seat
of
violent
and
extensive
igneous
action
along
the
burnt
river
valley
the
strata
are
evidently
sedimentary
rocks
altered
by
the
intrusion
of
volcanic
products
which
in
some
instances
have
penetrated
and
essentially
changed
their
original
condition
along
our
line
of
route
from
this
point
to
the
california
mountains
there
seems
but
little
essential
change
all
our
specimens
of
sedimentary
rocks
show
them
much
altered
and
volcanic
productions
appear
to
prevail
throughout
the
whole
intervening
distance
the
road
now
led
along
the
mountain
side
around
heads
of
the
precipitous
ravines
and
keeping
men
ahead
to
clear
the
road
we
passed
alternately
through
bodies
of
timber
and
small
open
prairies
and
encamped
in
a
large
meadow
in
view
of
the
great
prairie
below
at
sunset
the
thermometer
was
at
and
the
night
was
very
clear
and
bright
water
was
only
to
be
had
here
by
descending
a
bad
ravine
into
which
we
drove
our
animals
and
had
much
trouble
with
them
in
a
very
close
growth
of
small
pines
preuss
had
walked
ahead
and
did
not
get
into
the
camp
this
evening
the
trees
here
maintained
their
size
and
one
of
the
black
spruces
measured
feet
in
circumference
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
camp
pines
have
reappeared
here
among
the
timber
the
morning
was
very
clear
there
had
been
a
heavy
white
frost
during
the
night
and
at
sunrise
the
thermometer
was
at
after
cutting
through
two
thick
bodies
of
timber
in
which
i
noticed
some
small
trees
of
spruce
the
forest
became
more
open
and
we
had
no
longer
any
trouble
to
clear
a
way
the
pines
here
were
or
feet
in
circumference
and
about
feet
high
and
appeared
to
love
the
open
grounds
the
trail
now
led
along
one
of
the
long
spurs
of
the
mountain
descending
gradually
towards
the
plain
and
after
a
few
miles
traveling
we
emerged
finally
from
the
forest
in
full
view
of
the
plain
below
and
saw
the
snowy
mass
of
mount
hood
standing
high
out
above
the
surrounding
country
at
the
distance
of
miles
the
road
along
the
ridge
was
excellent
and
the
grass
very
green
and
good
the
old
grass
having
been
burnt
off
early
in
the
autumn
about
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
a
little
bottom
of
the
walahwalah
river
where
we
found
preuss
who
yesterday
had
reached
this
place
and
found
himself
too
far
in
advance
of
the
camp
to
return
the
stream
here
has
just
issued
from
the
narrow
ravines
which
are
walled
with
precipices
in
which
the
rock
has
a
brown
and
more
burnt
appearance
than
above
at
sunset
the
thermometer
was
at
and
our
position
was
in
longitude
and
in
latitude
the
morning
was
clear
with
a
temperature
at
sunrise
of
crossing
the
river
we
traveled
over
a
hilly
country
with
a
good
the
river
bottom
which
generally
contains
the
best
soil
in
other
countries
being
here
a
sterile
level
of
rocks
and
pebbles
we
had
found
the
soil
in
the
blue
mountains
to
be
of
excellent
quality
and
it
appeared
also
to
be
good
here
among
the
lower
hills
reaching
a
little
eminence
over
which
the
trail
passed
we
had
an
extensive
view
along
the
course
of
the
river
which
was
divided
and
spread
over
its
bottom
in
a
network
of
water
receiving
several
other
tributaries
from
the
mountains
there
was
a
band
of
several
hundred
horses
grazing
on
the
hills
about
two
miles
ahead
and
as
we
advanced
on
the
road
we
met
other
bands
which
indians
were
driving
out
to
pasture
also
on
the
hills
true
to
its
general
character
the
reverse
of
other
countries
the
hills
and
mountains
here
were
rich
in
grass
the
bottoms
barren
and
sterile
in
six
miles
we
crossed
a
principal
fork
below
which
the
scattered
waters
of
the
river
were
gathered
into
one
channel
and
passing
on
the
way
several
unfinished
houses
and
some
cleared
patches
where
corn
and
potatoes
were
cultivated
we
reached
in
about
eight
miles
further
the
missionary
establishment
of
whitman
which
consisted
at
this
time
of
one
house
built
of
unburnt
bricks
as
in
mexico
i
found
whitman
absent
on
a
visit
to
the
of
the
columbia
but
had
the
pleasure
to
see
a
family
of
emigrants
men
women
and
children
in
robust
health
all
indemnifying
themselves
for
previous
scanty
fare
in
a
hearty
consumption
of
potatoes
which
are
produced
here
of
a
remarkably
good
quality
we
were
disappointed
in
our
expectation
of
obtaining
or
flour
at
this
station
the
mill
belonging
to
the
mission
having
been
lately
burned
down
but
an
abundant
supply
of
excellent
potatoes
banished
regrets
and
furnished
a
grateful
substitute
for
bread
a
small
town
of
nez
perce
indians
gave
an
inhabited
and
even
a
populous
appearance
to
the
station
and
after
remaining
about
an
hour
we
continued
our
route
and
encamped
on
the
river
about
four
miles
below
passing
on
the
way
an
emigrant
encampment
temperature
at
sunset
the
weather
was
pleasant
with
a
sunrise
temperature
of
our
road
had
nothing
in
it
of
interest
and
the
country
offered
to
the
eye
only
a
sandy
undulating
plain
through
which
a
river
takes
its
course
we
halted
about
three
miles
above
the
mouth
on
account
of
grass
and
the
next
morning
arrived
at
the
nez
perce
fort
one
of
the
trading
establishments
of
the
hudson
bay
company
a
few
hundred
yards
above
the
junction
of
the
walahwalah
with
the
columbia
river
here
we
had
the
first
view
of
this
river
and
found
it
about
yards
wide
and
presenting
the
appearance
of
a
fine
navigable
stream
we
made
our
camp
in
a
little
grove
of
willows
on
the
walahwalah
which
are
the
only
trees
to
be
seen
in
the
neighborhood
but
were
obliged
to
send
the
animals
back
to
the
encampment
we
had
left
as
there
was
scarcely
a
blade
of
grass
to
be
found
the
post
is
on
the
bank
of
the
columbia
on
a
plain
of
bare
sands
from
which
the
air
was
literally
filled
with
clouds
of
dust
and
sand
during
one
of
the
few
days
we
remained
here
this
place
being
one
of
the
several
points
on
the
river
which
are
distinguished
for
prevailing
high
winds
that
come
from
the
sea
the
appearance
of
the
post
and
country
was
without
interest
except
that
we
here
saw
for
the
first
time
the
great
river
on
which
the
course
of
events
for
the
last
half
century
has
been
directing
attention
and
conferring
historical
fame
the
river
is
indeed
a
noble
object
and
has
here
attained
its
full
magnitude
about
nine
miles
above
and
in
sight
from
the
heights
about
this
post
is
the
junction
of
the
two
great
forks
which
constitute
the
main
stream
that
on
which
we
had
been
traveling
from
fort
hall
and
known
by
the
names
of
lewis
fork
shoshonee
and
snake
river
and
the
north
fork
which
has
retained
the
name
of
columbia
as
being
the
main
stream
we
did
not
go
up
to
the
junction
being
pressed
for
time
but
the
union
of
two
large
streams
coming
one
from
the
southeast
and
the
other
from
the
northeast
and
meeting
in
what
may
be
treated
as
the
geographical
centre
of
the
oregon
valley
thence
doubling
the
volume
of
water
to
the
ocean
while
opening
two
great
lines
of
communication
with
the
interior
continent
constitutes
a
feature
in
the
map
of
the
country
which
can
not
be
overlooked
and
it
was
probably
in
reference
to
this
junction
of
waters
and
these
lines
of
communication
that
this
post
was
established
they
are
important
lines
and
from
the
structure
of
the
country
must
forever
remain
so
one
of
them
leading
to
the
south
pass
and
to
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
the
other
to
the
pass
at
the
head
of
the
athabasca
river
and
to
the
countries
drained
by
the
waters
of
the
hudson
bay
the
british
fur
companies
now
use
both
lines
the
americans
in
their
emigration
to
oregon
have
begun
to
follow
the
one
which
leads
towards
the
united
states
bateaux
from
ascend
to
the
junction
and
thence
high
up
the
north
fork
or
columbia
land
conveyance
only
is
used
upon
the
line
of
lewis
fork
to
the
emigrants
to
oregon
the
nez
perce
is
a
point
of
great
interest
as
being
to
those
who
choose
it
the
termination
of
their
overland
journey
the
broad
expanse
of
the
river
here
invites
them
to
embark
on
its
bosom
and
the
lofty
trees
of
the
forest
furnish
the
means
of
doing
so
from
the
south
pass
to
this
place
is
about
miles
and
as
it
is
about
the
same
distance
from
that
pass
to
the
missouri
river
at
the
mouth
of
the
kansas
it
may
be
assumed
that
miles
is
the
land
travel
in
crossing
from
the
united
states
to
the
pacific
ocean
on
this
line
from
the
mouth
of
the
great
platte
it
would
be
about
miles
less
mckinley
the
commander
of
the
post
received
us
with
great
civility
and
both
to
myself
and
the
heads
of
the
emigrants
who
were
there
at
the
time
extended
the
rights
of
hospitality
in
a
comfortable
dinner
to
which
he
invited
us
by
a
meridional
altitude
of
the
sun
the
only
observation
that
the
weather
permitted
us
to
obtain
the
mouth
of
the
walahwalah
river
is
in
latitude
and
by
the
road
we
had
traveled
miles
from
fort
hall
at
the
time
of
our
arrival
a
considerable
body
of
emigrants
under
the
direction
of
applegate
a
man
of
considerable
resolution
and
energy
had
nearly
completed
the
building
of
a
number
of
mackinaw
boats
in
which
they
proposed
to
continue
their
further
voyage
down
the
columbia
i
had
seen
in
descending
the
walahwalah
river
a
fine
drove
of
several
hundred
cattle
which
they
had
exchanged
for
california
cattle
to
be
received
at
vancouver
and
which
are
considered
a
very
inferior
breed
the
other
portion
of
the
emigration
had
preferred
to
complete
their
journey
by
land
along
the
banks
of
the
columbia
taking
their
stock
and
wagons
with
them
having
reinforced
our
animals
with
eight
fresh
horses
hired
from
the
post
and
increased
our
stock
of
provisions
with
dried
salmon
potatoes
and
a
little
beef
we
resumed
our
journey
down
the
left
bank
of
the
columbia
being
guided
on
our
road
by
an
intelligent
indian
boy
whom
i
had
engaged
to
accompany
us
as
far
as
the
dalles
from
an
elevated
point
over
which
the
road
led
we
obtained
another
far
view
of
mount
hood
miles
distant
we
obtained
on
the
river
bank
an
observation
of
the
sun
at
noon
which
gave
for
the
latitude
the
country
was
very
unprepossessing
and
our
road
bad
and
as
we
toiled
slowly
along
through
deep
loose
sands
and
over
fragments
of
black
volcanic
rock
our
laborious
traveling
was
strongly
contrasted
with
the
rapid
progress
of
applegate
fleet
of
boats
which
suddenly
came
gliding
swiftly
down
the
broad
river
which
here
chanced
to
be
tranquil
and
smooth
at
evening
we
encamped
on
the
river
bank
where
there
was
very
little
grass
and
less
timber
we
frequently
met
indians
on
the
road
and
they
were
collected
at
every
favorable
spot
along
the
river
the
road
continued
along
the
river
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
mount
helens
another
snowy
peak
of
the
cascade
range
was
visible
we
crossed
the
umatilah
river
at
a
fall
near
its
mouth
this
stream
is
of
the
same
class
as
the
walahwalah
river
with
a
bed
of
volcanic
rock
in
places
split
into
fissures
our
encampment
was
similar
to
that
of
yesterday
there
was
very
little
grass
and
no
wood
the
indians
brought
us
some
pieces
for
sale
which
were
purchased
to
make
our
fires
by
observation
our
camp
is
in
latitude
and
longitude
the
night
has
been
cold
and
we
have
white
frost
this
morning
with
a
temperature
at
daylight
of
and
at
sunrise
of
the
early
morning
was
very
clear
and
the
stars
bright
but
as
usual
since
we
are
on
the
columbia
clouds
formed
immediately
with
the
rising
sun
the
day
continued
fine
the
east
being
covered
with
scattered
clouds
but
the
west
remaining
clear
showing
the
remarkable
peak
of
mount
hood
brightly
drawn
against
the
sky
this
was
in
view
all
day
in
the
southwest
but
no
other
peaks
of
the
range
were
visible
our
road
was
a
bad
one
of
very
loose
deep
sand
we
met
on
the
way
a
party
of
indians
unusually
they
appeared
intelligent
and
in
our
slight
intercourse
impressed
me
with
the
belief
that
they
possessed
some
aptitude
for
acquiring
languages
we
continued
to
travel
along
the
river
the
stream
being
interspersed
with
many
it
being
the
season
of
low
water
and
with
many
islands
and
an
apparently
good
navigation
small
willows
were
the
only
wood
rock
and
sand
the
prominent
geological
feature
the
rock
of
this
section
is
a
very
compact
and
tough
basalt
occurring
in
strata
which
have
the
appearance
of
being
broken
into
fragments
assuming
the
form
of
columnar
hills
and
appearing
always
in
escarpments
with
the
broken
fragments
strewed
at
the
base
and
over
the
adjoining
country
we
made
a
late
encampment
on
the
river
and
used
the
for
firewood
among
the
rocks
which
formed
the
bank
was
very
good
green
grass
latitude
longitude
november
mount
hood
is
glowing
in
the
sunlight
this
morning
and
the
air
is
pleasant
with
a
temperature
of
we
continued
down
the
river
and
passing
through
a
pretty
green
valley
bounded
by
high
precipitous
rocks
encamped
at
the
lower
end
on
the
right
shore
the
banks
of
the
columbia
are
very
high
and
steep
the
river
is
feet
broad
and
dark
bluffs
of
rock
give
it
a
picturesque
appearance
the
river
here
entered
among
bluffs
leaving
no
longer
room
for
a
road
and
we
accordingly
left
it
and
took
a
more
inland
way
among
the
river
hills
on
which
we
had
no
sooner
entered
than
we
found
a
great
improvement
in
the
country
the
sand
had
disappeared
and
the
soil
was
good
and
covered
with
excellent
grass
although
the
surface
was
broken
into
high
hills
with
uncommonly
deep
valleys
at
noon
we
crossed
john
day
river
a
clear
and
beautiful
stream
with
a
swift
current
and
a
bed
of
rolled
stones
it
is
sunk
in
a
deep
valley
which
is
characteristic
of
all
the
streams
in
this
region
and
the
hill
we
descended
to
reach
it
well
deserves
the
name
of
mountain
some
of
the
emigrants
had
encamped
on
the
river
and
others
at
the
summit
of
the
farther
hill
the
ascent
of
which
had
probably
cost
their
wagons
a
day
labor
and
others
again
had
halted
for
the
night
a
few
miles
beyond
where
they
had
slept
without
water
we
also
encamped
in
a
grassy
hollow
without
water
but
as
we
had
been
forewarned
of
this
privation
by
the
guide
the
animals
had
all
been
watered
at
the
river
and
we
had
brought
with
us
a
sufficient
quantity
for
the
night
after
two
hours
ride
through
a
fertile
hilly
country
covered
as
all
the
upland
here
appears
to
be
with
good
green
grass
we
descended
again
into
the
river
bottom
along
which
we
resumed
our
sterile
road
and
in
about
four
miles
reached
the
ford
of
the
fall
river
aux
a
considerable
tributary
to
the
columbia
we
had
heard
on
reaching
the
nez
perce
fort
a
repetition
of
the
account
in
regard
to
the
unsettled
character
of
the
columbia
indians
at
the
present
time
and
to
our
little
party
they
had
at
various
points
manifested
a
not
very
friendly
disposition
in
several
attempts
to
steal
our
horses
at
this
place
i
expected
to
find
a
band
who
had
plundered
a
party
of
emigrant
men
a
few
days
before
and
taken
away
their
horses
and
accordingly
we
made
the
necessary
preparation
for
our
security
but
happily
met
with
no
difficulty
the
river
was
high
divided
into
several
arms
with
a
rocky
island
at
its
outlet
into
the
columbia
which
at
this
place
it
rivalled
in
size
and
apparently
derived
its
highly
characteristic
name
which
is
received
from
one
of
its
many
falls
some
forty
miles
up
the
river
it
entered
the
columbia
with
a
roar
of
falls
and
rapids
and
is
probably
a
favorite
fishing
station
among
the
indians
with
whom
both
banks
of
the
river
were
populous
but
they
scarcely
paid
any
attention
to
us
the
ford
was
very
difficult
at
this
time
and
had
they
entertained
any
bad
intentions
they
were
offered
a
good
opportunity
to
carry
them
out
as
i
drove
directly
into
the
river
and
during
the
crossing
the
howitzer
was
occasionally
several
feet
under
water
and
a
number
of
the
men
appeared
to
be
more
often
below
than
above
our
guide
was
well
acquainted
with
the
ford
and
we
succeeded
in
getting
every
thing
safe
over
to
the
left
bank
we
delayed
here
only
a
short
time
to
put
the
gun
in
order
and
ascending
a
long
mountain
hill
resumed
our
route
again
among
the
interior
hills
the
roar
of
the
of
the
is
heard
from
the
heights
where
we
halted
a
few
moments
to
enjoy
a
fine
view
of
the
river
below
in
the
season
of
high
water
it
would
be
a
very
interesting
object
to
visit
in
order
to
witness
what
is
related
of
the
annual
submerging
of
the
fall
under
the
waters
which
back
up
from
the
basin
below
constituting
a
great
natural
lock
at
this
place
but
time
had
become
an
object
of
serious
consideration
and
the
falls
in
their
present
state
had
been
seen
and
described
by
many
after
a
day
journey
of
miles
we
encamped
among
the
hills
on
a
little
clear
stream
where
as
usual
the
indians
immediately
gathered
round
us
among
them
was
a
very
old
man
almost
blind
from
age
with
long
and
very
white
hair
i
happened
of
my
own
accord
to
give
this
old
man
a
present
of
tobacco
and
was
struck
with
the
impression
which
my
unpropitiated
notice
made
on
the
indians
who
appeared
in
a
remarkable
manner
acquainted
with
the
real
value
of
goods
and
to
understand
the
equivalents
of
trade
at
evening
one
of
them
spoke
a
few
words
to
his
people
and
telling
me
that
we
need
entertain
no
uneasiness
in
regard
to
our
animals
as
none
of
them
would
be
disturbed
they
went
all
quietly
away
in
the
morning
when
they
again
came
to
the
camp
i
expressed
to
them
the
gratification
we
felt
at
their
reasonable
conduct
making
them
a
present
of
some
large
knives
and
a
few
smaller
articles
the
road
continued
among
the
hills
and
reaching
an
eminence
we
saw
before
us
watered
by
a
clear
stream
a
tolerably
large
valley
through
which
the
trail
passed
in
comparison
with
the
indians
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
great
eastern
plain
these
are
disagreeably
dirty
in
their
habits
their
huts
were
crowded
with
women
and
children
and
the
atmosphere
within
was
any
thing
but
pleasant
to
persons
who
had
just
been
riding
in
the
fresh
morning
air
we
were
somewhat
amused
with
the
scanty
dress
of
a
woman
who
in
common
with
the
others
rushed
out
of
the
huts
on
our
arrival
and
who
in
default
of
other
covering
used
a
child
for
a
the
road
in
about
half
an
hour
passed
near
an
elevated
point
from
which
we
overlooked
the
valley
of
the
columbia
for
many
miles
and
saw
in
the
distance
several
houses
surrounded
by
fields
which
a
chief
who
had
accompanied
us
from
the
village
pointed
out
to
us
as
the
methodist
missionary
station
in
a
few
miles
we
descended
to
the
river
which
we
reached
at
one
of
its
remarkably
interesting
features
known
as
the
of
the
the
whole
volume
of
the
river
at
this
place
passed
between
the
walls
of
a
chasm
which
has
the
appearance
of
having
been
rent
through
the
basaltic
strata
which
form
the
of
the
region
at
the
narrowest
place
we
found
the
breadth
by
measurement
yards
and
the
average
height
of
the
walls
above
the
water
feet
forming
a
trough
between
the
rocks
whence
the
name
probably
applied
by
a
canadian
voyageur
the
mass
of
water
in
the
present
low
state
of
the
river
passed
swiftly
between
deep
and
black
and
curled
into
many
small
whirlpools
and
counter
currents
but
unbroken
by
foam
and
so
still
that
scarcely
the
sound
of
a
ripple
was
heard
the
rock
for
a
considerable
distance
from
the
river
was
worn
over
a
large
portion
of
its
surface
into
circular
holes
and
cavities
by
the
abrasion
of
the
river
which
at
the
season
of
high
waters
is
spread
out
over
the
adjoining
bottoms
in
the
recent
passage
through
this
chasm
an
unfortunate
event
had
occurred
to
applegate
party
in
the
loss
of
one
of
their
boats
which
had
been
carried
under
water
in
the
midst
of
the
and
two
of
applegate
children
and
one
man
drowned
this
misfortune
was
attributed
only
to
want
of
skill
in
the
steersman
as
at
this
season
there
was
no
impediment
to
navigation
although
the
place
is
entirely
impassable
at
high
water
when
boats
pass
safely
over
the
great
falls
above
in
the
submerged
state
in
which
they
then
find
themselves
the
basalt
here
is
precisely
the
same
as
that
which
constitutes
the
rock
of
the
valley
higher
up
the
columbia
being
very
compact
with
a
few
round
cavities
we
passed
rapidly
three
or
four
miles
down
the
level
valley
and
encamped
near
the
mission
the
character
of
the
forest
growth
here
changes
and
we
found
ourselves
with
pleasure
again
among
oaks
and
other
of
the
east
to
which
we
had
long
been
strangers
and
the
hospitable
and
kind
reception
with
which
we
were
welcomed
among
our
country
people
at
the
mission
aided
the
momentary
illusion
of
home
two
wooden
and
a
large
schoolhouse
with
stables
barn
and
garden
and
large
cleared
fields
between
the
houses
and
the
river
bank
on
which
were
scattered
the
wooden
huts
of
an
indian
village
gave
to
the
valley
the
cheerful
and
busy
air
of
civilization
and
had
in
our
eyes
an
appearance
of
abundant
and
enviable
comfort
our
land
journey
found
here
its
western
termination
the
delay
involved
in
getting
our
camp
to
the
right
bank
of
the
columbia
and
in
opening
a
road
through
the
continuous
forest
to
vancouver
rendered
a
journey
along
the
river
impracticable
and
on
this
side
the
usual
road
across
the
mountain
required
strong
and
fresh
animals
there
being
an
interval
of
three
days
in
which
they
could
obtain
no
food
i
therefore
wrote
immediately
to
fitzpatrick
directing
him
to
abandon
the
carts
at
the
walahwalah
missionary
station
and
as
soon
as
the
necessary
could
be
made
which
his
party
required
meet
me
at
the
dalles
from
which
point
i
proposed
to
commence
our
homeward
journey
the
day
after
our
arrival
being
sunday
no
business
could
be
done
at
the
mission
but
on
monday
perkins
assisted
me
in
procuring
from
the
indians
a
large
canoe
in
which
i
designed
to
complete
our
journey
to
vancouver
where
i
expected
to
obtain
the
necessary
supply
of
provisions
and
stores
for
our
winter
journey
three
indians
from
the
family
to
whom
the
canoe
belonged
were
engaged
to
assist
in
working
her
during
the
voyage
and
with
them
our
water
party
consisted
of
preuss
and
myself
with
bernier
and
jacob
dodson
in
charge
of
the
party
which
was
to
remain
at
the
dalles
i
left
carson
with
instructions
to
occupy
the
people
in
making
and
refitting
their
equipage
the
village
from
which
we
were
to
take
the
canoe
was
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
about
ten
miles
below
at
the
mouth
of
the
tinanens
creek
and
while
preuss
proceeded
down
the
river
with
the
instruments
in
a
little
canoe
paddled
by
two
indians
perkins
accompanied
me
with
the
remainder
of
the
party
by
land
the
last
of
the
emigrants
had
just
left
the
dalles
at
the
time
of
our
arrival
traveling
some
by
water
and
others
by
land
making
rafts
on
which
they
had
embarked
their
families
and
households
with
their
large
wagons
and
other
furniture
while
their
stock
were
driven
along
the
shore
for
about
five
miles
below
the
dalles
the
river
is
narrow
and
probably
very
deep
but
during
this
distance
it
is
somewhat
open
with
grassy
bottoms
on
the
left
entering
then
among
the
lower
mountains
of
the
cascade
range
it
assumes
a
general
character
and
high
and
steep
rocky
hills
shut
it
in
on
either
side
rising
abruptly
in
places
to
the
height
of
fifteen
hundred
feet
above
the
water
and
gradually
acquiring
a
more
mountainous
character
as
the
river
approaches
the
cascades
after
an
hour
travel
when
the
sun
was
nearly
down
we
searched
along
the
shore
for
a
pleasant
place
and
halted
to
prepare
supper
we
had
been
well
supplied
by
our
friends
at
the
mission
with
delicious
salted
salmon
which
had
been
taken
at
the
fattest
season
also
with
potatoes
bread
coffee
and
sugar
we
were
delighted
at
a
change
in
our
mode
of
traveling
and
living
the
canoe
sailed
smoothly
down
the
river
at
night
we
encamped
upon
the
shore
and
a
plentiful
supply
of
comfortable
provisions
supplied
the
first
of
wants
we
enjoyed
the
contrast
which
it
presented
to
our
late
toilsome
marchings
our
night
watchings
and
our
frequent
privation
of
food
we
were
a
motley
group
but
all
happy
three
unknown
indians
jacob
a
colored
man
preuss
a
german
bernier
creole
french
and
myself
being
now
upon
the
ground
explored
by
the
south
sea
expedition
under
captain
wilkes
and
having
accomplished
the
object
of
uniting
my
survey
with
his
and
thus
presenting
a
connected
exploration
from
the
mississippi
to
the
pacific
and
the
winter
being
at
hand
i
deemed
it
necessary
to
economize
time
by
voyaging
in
the
night
as
is
customary
here
to
avoid
the
high
winds
which
rise
with
the
morning
and
decline
with
the
day
accordingly
after
an
hour
halt
we
again
embarked
and
resumed
our
pleasant
voyage
down
the
river
the
wind
rose
to
a
gale
after
several
hours
but
the
moon
was
very
bright
and
the
wind
was
fair
and
the
canoe
glanced
rapidly
down
the
stream
the
waves
breaking
into
foam
alongside
and
our
night
voyage
as
the
wind
bore
us
rapidly
along
between
the
dark
mountains
was
wild
and
interesting
about
midnight
we
put
to
the
shore
on
a
rocky
beach
behind
which
was
a
dark
looking
pine
forest
we
built
up
large
fires
among
the
rocks
which
were
in
large
masses
round
about
and
arranging
our
blankets
on
the
most
sheltered
places
we
could
find
passed
a
delightful
night
after
an
early
breakfast
at
daylight
we
resumed
our
journey
the
weather
being
clear
and
beautiful
and
the
river
smooth
and
still
on
either
side
the
mountains
are
all
rocky
and
high
we
were
now
approaching
one
of
the
marked
features
of
the
lower
columbia
where
the
river
forms
a
great
with
a
series
of
rapids
in
breaking
through
the
range
of
mountains
to
which
the
lofty
peaks
of
mount
hood
and
helens
belong
and
which
rise
as
great
pillars
of
snow
on
either
side
of
the
passage
the
main
branch
of
the
river
and
the
issue
in
cascades
from
this
range
and
the
columbia
breaking
through
it
in
a
succession
of
cascades
gives
the
idea
of
cascades
to
the
whole
range
and
hence
the
name
of
cascade
range
which
it
bears
and
distinguishes
it
from
the
coast
range
lower
down
in
making
a
short
turn
to
the
south
the
river
forms
the
cascades
in
breaking
over
a
point
of
agglomerated
masses
of
rock
leaving
a
handsome
bay
to
the
right
with
several
rocky
islands
and
the
mountains
sweep
at
a
distance
around
a
cove
where
several
small
streams
enter
the
bay
in
less
than
an
hour
we
halted
on
the
left
bank
about
five
minutes
walk
above
the
cascades
where
there
were
several
indian
huts
and
where
our
guides
signified
it
was
customary
to
hire
indians
to
assist
in
making
the
when
traveling
with
a
boat
as
light
as
a
canoe
which
may
easily
be
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
the
indians
this
is
much
the
better
side
of
the
river
for
the
portage
as
the
ground
here
is
very
good
and
level
being
a
handsome
bottom
which
i
remarked
was
covered
was
now
always
the
case
along
the
with
a
growth
of
green
and
grass
it
was
long
before
we
could
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
indians
but
to
length
when
they
had
first
received
the
price
of
their
assistance
in
goods
they
went
vigorously
to
work
and
in
a
shorter
time
than
had
been
occupied
in
making
our
arrangements
the
canoe
instruments
and
baggage
were
carried
through
a
distance
of
about
half
a
mile
to
the
bank
below
the
main
cascade
where
we
again
embarked
the
water
being
white
with
foam
among
ugly
rocks
and
boiling
into
a
thousand
whirlpools
the
boat
passed
with
great
rapidity
crossing
and
recrossing
in
the
eddies
of
the
current
after
passing
through
about
two
miles
of
broken
water
we
ran
some
rapids
which
are
called
the
lower
rapids
being
the
last
on
the
river
which
below
is
tranquil
and
smooth
a
broad
magnificent
stream
on
a
low
broad
point
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
at
the
lower
end
of
these
rapids
were
pitched
many
tents
of
the
emigrants
who
were
waiting
here
for
their
friends
from
above
or
for
boats
and
provisions
which
were
expected
from
vancouver
in
our
passage
down
the
rapids
i
had
noticed
their
camps
along
the
shore
or
transporting
their
goods
across
the
portage
this
portage
makes
a
head
of
navigation
ascending
the
river
it
is
about
two
miles
in
length
and
above
to
the
dalles
is
miles
of
smooth
and
good
navigation
we
glided
on
without
further
interruption
between
very
rocky
and
high
steep
mountains
which
sweep
along
the
river
valley
at
a
little
distance
covered
with
forests
of
pine
and
showing
occasionally
lofty
escarpments
of
red
rock
nearer
the
shore
is
bordered
by
steep
escarped
hills
end
huge
vertical
rocks
from
which
the
waters
of
the
mountain
reach
the
river
in
a
variety
of
beautiful
falls
sometimes
several
hundred
feet
in
height
occasionally
along
the
river
occurred
pretty
bottoms
covered
with
the
greenest
verdure
of
the
spring
to
a
professional
farmer
however
it
does
not
offer
many
places
of
sufficient
extent
to
be
valuable
for
agriculture
and
after
passing
a
few
miles
below
the
dalles
i
had
scarcely
seen
a
place
on
the
south
shore
where
wagons
could
get
to
the
river
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
was
heightened
by
the
continuance
of
very
delightful
weather
resembling
the
indian
summer
of
the
atlantic
a
few
miles
below
the
cascades
we
passed
a
singular
isolated
hill
and
in
the
course
of
the
next
six
miles
occurred
five
very
pretty
falls
from
the
heights
on
the
left
bank
one
of
them
being
of
a
very
picturesque
character
and
towards
sunset
we
reached
a
remarkable
point
of
rocks
distinguished
on
account
of
prevailing
high
winds
and
the
delay
it
frequently
occasions
to
the
canoe
navigation
by
the
name
of
it
borders
the
river
in
a
high
wall
of
rock
which
comes
boldly
down
into
deep
water
and
in
violent
gales
down
the
river
and
from
the
opposite
shore
which
is
the
prevailing
direction
of
strong
winds
the
water
is
dashed
against
it
with
considerable
violence
it
appears
to
form
a
serious
obstacle
to
canoe
traveling
and
i
was
informed
by
perkins
that
in
a
voyage
up
the
river
he
had
been
detained
two
weeks
at
this
place
and
was
finally
obliged
to
return
to
vancouver
the
winds
of
this
region
deserve
a
particular
study
they
blow
in
currents
which
show
them
to
be
governed
by
fixed
laws
and
it
is
a
problem
how
far
they
may
come
from
the
mountains
or
from
the
ocean
through
the
breaks
in
the
mountains
which
let
out
the
river
the
hills
here
had
lost
something
of
their
rocky
appearance
and
had
already
begun
to
decline
as
the
sun
went
down
we
searched
along
the
river
for
an
inviting
spot
and
finding
a
clean
rocky
beach
where
some
large
dry
trees
were
lying
on
the
ground
we
ran
our
boat
to
the
shore
and
after
another
comfortable
supper
ploughed
our
way
along
the
river
in
darkness
heavy
clouds
covered
the
sky
this
evening
and
the
wind
began
to
sweep
in
gusts
among
the
trees
as
if
bad
weather
were
coming
as
we
advanced
the
hills
on
both
sides
grew
constantly
lower
on
the
right
retreating
from
the
shore
and
forming
a
somewhat
extensive
bottom
of
intermingled
prairie
and
wooded
land
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
and
opposite
to
a
small
stream
corning
in
from
the
north
called
the
river
the
highlands
on
the
left
declined
to
the
plains
and
three
or
four
miles
more
disappeared
entirely
on
both
sides
and
the
river
entered
the
low
country
the
river
had
gradually
expanded
and
when
we
emerged
from
the
highlands
the
opposite
shores
were
so
distant
as
to
appear
indistinct
in
the
uncertainty
of
the
light
about
ten
our
pilots
halted
apparently
to
confer
about
the
course
and
after
a
little
hesitation
pulled
directly
across
an
open
expansion
of
the
river
where
the
waves
were
somewhat
rough
for
a
canoe
the
wind
blowing
very
fresh
much
to
our
surprise
a
few
minutes
afterwards
we
ran
aground
backing
off
our
boat
we
made
repeated
trials
at
various
places
to
cross
what
appeared
to
be
a
point
of
shifting
where
we
had
attempted
to
shorten
the
way
by
a
finally
one
of
our
indians
got
into
the
water
and
waded
about
until
he
found
a
channel
sufficiently
deep
through
which
we
wound
along
after
him
and
in
a
few
minutes
again
entered
the
deep
water
below
as
we
paddled
rapidly
down
the
river
we
heard
the
noise
of
a
at
work
on
the
right
bank
and
letting
our
boat
float
quietly
down
we
listened
with
pleasure
to
the
unusual
sounds
and
before
midnight
encamped
on
the
bank
of
the
river
about
a
mile
above
fort
vancouver
our
fine
dry
weather
had
given
place
to
a
dark
cloudy
night
at
midnight
it
began
to
rain
and
we
found
ourselves
suddenly
in
the
gloomy
and
humid
season
which
in
the
narrow
region
lying
between
the
pacific
and
the
cascade
mountains
and
for
a
considerable
distance
along
the
coast
supplies
the
place
of
winter
in
the
morning
the
first
object
that
attracted
my
attention
was
the
barque
columbia
lying
at
anchor
near
the
landing
she
was
about
to
start
on
a
voyage
to
england
and
was
now
ready
for
sea
being
detained
only
in
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
express
bateaux
which
descend
the
columbia
and
its
north
fork
with
the
overland
mail
from
canada
and
hudson
bay
which
had
been
delayed
beyond
the
usual
time
i
immediately
waited
upon
mclaughlin
the
executive
officer
of
the
hudson
bay
company
in
the
territory
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
who
received
me
with
the
courtesy
and
hospitality
for
which
he
has
been
eminently
distinguished
and
which
makes
a
forcible
and
delightful
impression
on
a
traveler
from
the
long
wilderness
from
which
we
had
issued
i
was
immediately
supplied
by
him
with
the
necessary
stores
and
provisions
to
refit
and
support
my
party
in
our
contemplated
winter
journey
to
the
states
and
also
with
a
mackinaw
boat
and
canoes
manned
with
canadian
and
iroquois
voyageurs
and
indians
for
their
transportation
to
the
dalles
of
the
columbia
in
addition
to
this
efficient
kindness
in
furnishing
me
with
these
necessary
supplies
i
received
from
him
a
warm
and
gratifying
sympathy
in
the
suffering
which
his
great
experience
led
him
to
anticipate
for
us
in
our
homeward
journey
and
a
letter
of
recommendation
and
credit
for
any
officers
of
the
hudson
bay
company
into
whose
posts
we
might
be
driven
by
unexpected
misfortune
of
course
the
future
supplies
for
my
party
were
paid
for
bills
on
the
government
of
the
united
states
being
readily
taken
but
every
hospitable
attention
was
extended
to
me
and
i
accepted
an
invitation
to
take
a
room
in
the
fort
to
make
myself
at
home
while
i
i
found
many
american
emigrants
at
the
fort
others
had
already
crossed
the
river
into
their
land
of
promise
the
walahmette
valley
others
were
daily
arriving
and
all
of
them
have
been
furnished
with
shelter
so
far
as
it
could
be
afforded
by
the
buildings
connected
with
the
establishment
necessary
clothing
and
provisions
the
latter
to
be
returned
in
kind
from
the
produce
of
their
labor
were
also
furnished
this
friendly
assistance
was
of
very
great
value
to
the
emigrants
whose
families
were
otherwise
exposed
to
much
suffering
in
the
winter
rains
which
had
now
commenced
at
the
same
time
they
were
in
want
of
all
the
common
necessaries
of
life
those
who
had
taken
a
water
conveyance
at
the
nez
perce
fort
continued
to
arrive
safely
with
no
other
accident
than
has
been
already
mentioned
the
party
which
had
crossed
over
the
cascade
mountains
were
reported
to
have
lost
a
number
of
their
animals
and
those
who
had
driven
their
stock
down
the
columbia
had
brought
them
safely
in
and
found
for
them
a
ready
and
very
profitable
market
and
were
already
proposing
to
return
to
the
states
in
the
spring
for
another
supply
in
the
space
of
two
days
our
preparations
had
been
completed
and
we
were
ready
to
set
out
on
our
return
it
would
have
been
very
gratifying
to
have
gone
down
to
the
pacific
and
solely
in
the
interest
and
love
of
geography
to
have
seen
the
ocean
on
the
western
as
well
as
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
continent
so
as
to
give
a
satisfactory
completeness
to
the
geographical
picture
which
had
been
formed
in
our
minds
but
the
rainy
season
had
now
regularly
set
in
and
the
air
was
filled
with
fogs
and
rain
which
left
no
beauty
in
any
scenery
and
obstructed
observations
the
object
of
my
instructions
had
been
entirely
fulfilled
in
having
connected
our
reconnoissance
with
the
surveys
of
captain
wilkes
and
although
it
would
have
been
agreeable
and
satisfactory
to
terminate
here
also
our
ruder
astronomical
observations
i
was
not
for
such
a
reason
justified
to
make
a
delay
in
waiting
for
favorable
weather
near
sunset
of
the
the
boats
left
the
fort
and
encamped
after
making
only
a
few
miles
our
flotilla
consisted
of
a
mackinaw
barge
and
three
canoes
one
of
them
that
in
which
we
had
descended
the
river
and
a
party
in
all
of
twenty
men
one
of
the
emigrants
burnet
of
missouri
who
had
left
his
family
and
property
at
the
dalles
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
afforded
by
the
return
of
our
boats
to
bring
them
down
to
vancouver
this
gentleman
as
well
as
the
applegate
and
others
of
the
emigrants
whom
i
saw
possessed
intelligence
and
character
with
the
moral
and
intellectual
stamina
as
well
as
the
enterprise
which
give
solidity
and
respectability
to
the
foundation
of
colonies
the
morning
was
rainy
and
misty
we
did
not
move
with
the
practised
celerity
of
my
own
camp
and
it
was
nearly
nine
when
our
motley
crew
had
finished
their
breakfast
and
were
ready
to
start
once
afloat
however
they
worked
steadily
and
well
and
we
advanced
at
a
good
rate
up
the
river
and
in
the
afternoon
a
breeze
sprung
up
which
enabled
us
to
add
a
sail
to
the
oars
at
evening
we
encamped
on
a
beach
on
the
right
bank
at
the
foot
of
the
high
immediately
at
the
lower
end
of
cape
horn
on
the
opposite
shore
is
said
to
be
a
singular
hole
in
the
mountain
from
which
the
indians
believe
comes
the
wind
producing
these
gales
it
is
called
the
devil
hole
and
the
indians
i
was
told
had
been
resolving
to
send
down
one
of
their
slaves
to
explore
the
region
below
at
dark
the
wind
shifted
into
its
stormy
quarter
gradually
increasing
to
a
gale
from
the
southwest
and
the
sky
becoming
clear
i
obtained
a
good
observation
of
an
emersion
of
the
first
satellite
the
result
of
which
being
an
absolute
observation
i
have
adopted
for
the
longitude
of
the
place
the
wind
during
the
night
had
increased
to
so
much
violence
that
the
broad
river
this
morning
was
angry
and
white
the
waves
breaking
with
considerable
force
against
this
rocky
wall
of
the
cape
our
old
iroquois
pilot
was
unwilling
to
risk
the
boats
around
the
point
and
i
was
not
disposed
to
hazard
the
stores
of
our
voyage
for
the
delay
of
a
day
further
observations
were
obtained
during
the
day
giving
for
the
latitude
of
the
place
and
the
longitude
obtained
from
the
satellite
is
we
had
a
day
of
disagreeable
and
cold
rain
and
late
in
the
afternoon
began
to
approach
the
rapids
of
the
cascades
there
is
here
a
high
timbered
island
on
the
left
shore
below
which
in
descending
i
had
remarked
in
a
bluff
of
the
river
the
extremities
of
trunks
of
trees
appearing
to
be
imbedded
in
the
rock
landing
here
this
afternoon
i
found
in
the
lower
part
of
the
escarpment
a
stratum
of
coal
and
imbedded
between
strata
of
altered
clay
containing
the
remains
of
vegetables
the
leaves
of
which
indicate
that
the
plants
wore
dicotyledonous
among
these
the
stems
of
some
of
the
ferns
are
not
mineralized
but
merely
charred
retaining
still
their
vegetable
structure
and
substance
and
in
this
condition
a
portion
of
the
trees
remain
the
indurated
appearance
and
compactness
of
the
strata
as
well
perhaps
as
the
mineralized
condition
of
the
coal
are
probably
due
to
igneous
action
some
portions
of
the
coal
precisely
resemble
in
aspect
the
canal
coal
of
england
and
with
the
accompanying
fossils
have
been
referred
to
the
tertiary
formation
these
strata
appear
to
rest
upon
a
mass
of
agglomerated
rock
being
but
a
few
feet
above
the
water
of
the
river
and
over
them
is
the
escarpment
of
perhaps
feet
rising
gradually
in
the
rear
towards
the
mountains
the
wet
and
cold
evening
and
near
approach
of
night
prevented
me
from
making
any
other
than
a
slight
examination
the
current
was
now
very
swift
and
we
were
obliged
to
the
boat
along
the
left
shore
where
the
bank
was
covered
with
large
masses
of
rocks
night
overtook
us
at
the
upper
end
of
the
island
a
short
distance
below
the
cascades
and
we
halted
on
the
open
point
in
the
mean
time
the
lighter
canoes
paddled
altogether
by
indians
had
passed
ahead
and
were
out
of
sight
with
them
was
the
lodge
which
was
the
only
shelter
we
had
with
most
of
the
bedding
and
provisions
we
shouted
and
fired
guns
but
all
to
no
purpose
as
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
hear
above
the
roar
of
the
river
and
we
remained
all
night
without
shelter
the
rain
pouring
down
all
the
time
the
old
voyageurs
did
not
appear
to
mind
it
much
but
covered
themselves
up
as
well
as
they
could
and
lay
down
on
the
where
they
remained
quiet
until
morning
the
rest
of
us
spent
a
rather
miserable
night
and
to
add
to
our
discomfort
the
incessant
rain
extinguished
our
fires
and
we
were
glad
when
at
last
daylight
appeared
and
we
again
embarked
crossing
to
the
right
bank
we
the
boat
along
the
shore
there
being
no
longer
any
use
of
the
paddles
and
put
into
a
little
bay
below
the
upper
rapids
here
we
found
a
lodge
pitched
and
about
indians
sitting
around
a
blazing
fire
within
making
a
luxurious
breakfast
with
salmon
bread
butter
sugar
coffee
and
other
provisions
in
the
forest
on
the
edge
of
the
high
bluff
overlooking
the
river
is
an
indian
graveyard
consisting
of
a
collection
of
tombs
in
each
of
which
were
the
scattered
bones
of
many
skeletons
the
tombs
were
made
of
boards
which
were
ornamented
with
many
figures
of
men
and
animals
of
the
natural
size
from
their
appearance
constituting
the
armorial
device
by
which
among
indians
the
chiefs
are
usually
known
the
masses
of
rock
displayed
along
the
shores
of
the
ravine
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
cascades
are
clearly
volcanic
products
between
this
cove
which
i
called
graveyard
bay
and
another
spot
of
smooth
water
above
on
the
right
called
luders
bay
sheltered
by
a
jutting
point
of
huge
rocky
masses
at
the
foot
of
the
cascades
the
shore
along
the
intervening
rapids
is
lined
with
precipices
of
distinct
strata
of
red
and
lavas
in
inclined
positions
the
masses
of
rock
forming
the
point
at
luders
bay
consist
of
a
porous
trap
or
basalt
a
volcanic
product
of
a
modern
period
the
rocks
belong
to
agglomerated
masses
which
form
the
immediate
ground
of
the
cascades
and
have
been
already
mentioned
as
constituting
a
bed
of
cemented
conglomerate
rocks
appearing
at
various
places
along
the
river
here
they
are
scattered
along
the
shores
and
through
the
bed
of
the
river
wearing
the
character
of
convulsion
which
forms
the
impressive
and
prominent
feature
of
the
river
at
this
place
wherever
we
came
in
contact
with
the
rocks
of
these
mountains
we
found
them
volcanic
which
is
probably
the
character
of
the
range
and
at
this
time
two
of
the
great
snowy
cones
mount
regnier
and
helens
were
in
action
on
the
of
the
preceding
november
helens
had
scattered
its
ashes
like
a
white
fall
of
snow
over
the
dalles
of
the
columbia
miles
distant
a
specimen
of
these
ashes
was
given
to
me
by
mr
brewer
one
of
the
clergymen
at
the
dalles
the
lofty
range
of
the
cascade
mountains
forms
a
distinct
boundary
between
the
opposite
climates
of
the
regions
along
its
western
and
eastern
bases
on
the
west
they
present
a
barrier
to
the
clouds
of
fog
and
rain
which
roll
up
from
the
pacific
ocean
and
beat
against
their
rugged
sides
forming
the
rainy
season
of
the
winter
in
the
country
along
the
coast
into
the
brighter
skies
of
the
region
along
their
eastern
base
this
rainy
winter
never
penetrates
and
at
the
dalles
of
the
columbia
the
rainy
season
is
unknown
the
brief
winter
being
limited
to
a
period
of
about
two
months
during
which
the
earth
is
covered
with
the
slight
snows
of
a
climate
remarkably
mild
for
so
high
a
latitude
the
cascade
range
has
an
average
distance
of
about
miles
from
the
it
extends
far
both
north
and
south
of
the
columbia
and
is
indicated
to
the
distant
observer
both
in
course
and
position
by
the
lofty
volcanic
peaks
which
rise
out
of
it
and
which
are
visible
to
an
immense
distance
during
several
days
of
constant
rain
it
kept
our
whole
force
laboriously
employed
in
getting
our
barge
and
canoes
to
the
upper
end
of
the
cascades
the
portage
ground
was
occupied
by
emigrant
families
their
thin
and
insufficient
clothing
bareheaded
and
barefooted
children
attesting
the
length
of
their
journey
and
showing
that
they
had
in
many
instances
set
out
without
a
due
preparation
of
what
was
indispensable
a
gentleman
named
luders
a
botanist
from
the
city
of
hamburg
arrived
at
the
bay
i
have
called
by
his
name
while
we
were
occupied
in
bringing
up
the
boats
i
was
delighted
to
meet
at
such
a
place
a
man
of
kindred
pursuits
but
we
had
only
the
pleasure
of
a
brief
conversation
as
his
canoe
under
the
guidance
of
two
indians
was
about
to
run
the
rapids
and
i
could
not
enjoy
the
satisfaction
of
regaling
him
with
a
breakfast
which
after
his
recent
journey
would
have
been
an
extraordinary
luxury
all
of
his
few
instruments
and
baggage
were
in
the
canoe
and
he
hurried
around
by
land
to
meet
it
at
the
graveyard
bay
but
he
was
scarcely
out
of
sight
when
by
the
carelessness
of
the
indians
the
boat
was
drawn
into
the
midst
of
the
rapids
and
glanced
down
the
river
bottom
up
with
a
loss
of
every
thing
it
contained
in
the
natural
concern
i
felt
for
his
misfortune
i
gave
to
the
little
cove
the
name
of
luders
bay
we
continued
our
work
at
the
portage
about
noon
the
two
barges
of
the
express
from
montreal
arrived
at
the
upper
portage
landing
which
for
large
boats
is
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
they
were
a
crew
and
among
them
i
remarked
a
woman
and
her
daughter
emigrants
from
canada
it
was
satisfactory
to
see
the
order
and
speed
with
which
these
experienced
effected
the
portage
and
passed
their
boats
over
the
cascades
they
had
arrived
at
noon
and
in
the
evening
they
expected
to
reach
vancouver
these
bateaux
carry
the
express
of
the
hudson
bay
company
to
the
highest
navigable
point
of
the
north
fork
of
the
columbia
whence
it
is
carried
by
an
overland
party
to
lake
winipec
where
it
is
divided
part
going
to
montreal
and
part
to
hudson
bay
thus
a
regular
communication
is
kept
up
between
three
very
remote
points
the
canadian
emigrants
were
much
chagrined
at
the
change
of
climate
and
informed
me
that
only
a
few
miles
above
they
had
left
a
country
of
bright
blue
sky
and
a
shining
sun
the
next
morning
the
upper
parts
of
the
mountains
which
directly
overlook
the
cascades
were
white
with
the
freshly
fallen
snow
while
it
continued
to
rain
steadily
below
late
in
the
afternoon
we
finished
the
portage
and
embarking
again
moved
a
little
distance
up
the
right
bank
in
order
to
clear
the
smaller
rapids
of
the
cascades
and
have
a
smooth
river
for
the
next
morning
though
we
made
but
a
few
miles
the
weather
improved
immediately
and
though
the
rainy
country
and
the
cloudy
mountains
were
close
behind
before
us
was
the
bright
sky
so
distinctly
is
climate
here
marked
by
a
mountain
boundary
we
had
an
opportunity
to
complete
the
sketch
of
that
portion
of
the
river
down
which
we
had
come
by
night
many
places
occur
along
the
river
where
the
stumps
or
rather
portions
of
the
trunks
of
are
standing
along
the
shore
and
in
the
water
where
they
may
be
seen
at
a
considerable
depth
below
the
surface
in
the
beautifully
clear
water
these
collections
of
dead
trees
are
called
on
the
columbia
the
and
are
supposed
to
have
been
created
by
the
effects
of
some
convulsion
which
formed
the
cascades
and
which
by
damming
up
the
river
placed
these
trees
under
water
and
destroyed
them
but
i
venture
to
presume
that
the
cascades
are
older
than
the
trees
and
as
these
submerged
forests
occur
at
five
or
six
places
along
the
river
i
had
an
opportunity
to
satisfy
myself
that
they
have
been
formed
by
immense
landslides
from
the
mountains
which
here
closely
shut
in
the
river
and
which
brought
down
with
them
into
the
river
the
pines
of
the
mountain
at
one
place
on
the
right
bank
i
remarked
a
place
where
a
portion
of
one
of
these
slides
seemed
to
have
planted
itself
with
all
the
evergreen
foliage
and
the
vegetation
of
the
neighboring
hill
directly
amidst
the
falling
and
yellow
leaves
of
the
river
trees
it
occurred
to
me
that
this
would
have
been
a
beautiful
illustration
to
the
eye
of
a
botanist
following
the
course
of
a
slide
which
was
very
plainly
marked
along
the
mountain
i
found
that
in
the
interior
parts
the
trees
were
in
their
usual
erect
position
but
at
the
extremity
of
the
slide
they
were
rocked
about
and
thrown
into
a
confusion
of
inclinations
about
in
the
afternoon
we
passed
a
sandy
bar
in
the
river
whence
we
had
an
unexpected
view
of
mount
hood
bearing
directly
south
by
compass
during
the
day
we
used
oar
and
sail
and
at
night
had
again
a
delightful
camping
ground
and
a
dry
place
to
sleep
upon
the
day
again
was
pleasant
and
bright
at
we
passed
a
rock
island
on
the
right
shore
of
the
river
which
the
indians
use
as
a
burial
ground
and
halting
for
a
short
time
about
an
hour
afterwards
at
the
village
of
our
indian
friends
early
in
the
afternoon
we
arrived
again
at
the
dalles
carson
had
removed
the
camp
up
the
river
a
little
nearer
to
the
hills
where
the
animals
had
better
grass
we
found
every
thing
in
good
order
and
arrived
just
in
time
to
partake
of
an
excellent
roast
of
california
beef
my
friend
gilpin
had
arrived
in
advance
of
the
party
his
object
in
visiting
this
country
had
been
to
obtain
correct
information
of
the
walahmette
settlements
and
he
had
reached
this
point
in
his
journey
highly
pleased
with
the
country
over
which
he
had
traveled
and
with
invigorated
health
on
the
following
day
he
continued
his
journey
in
our
returning
boats
to
vancouver
the
camp
was
now
occupied
in
making
the
necessary
preparations
for
our
homeward
journey
which
though
homeward
contemplated
a
new
route
and
a
great
circuit
to
the
south
and
southeast
and
the
exploration
of
the
great
basin
between
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
three
principal
objects
were
indicated
by
report
or
by
maps
as
being
on
this
route
the
character
or
existence
of
which
i
wished
to
ascertain
and
which
i
assumed
as
landmarks
or
leading
points
on
their
projected
line
of
return
the
first
of
those
points
was
the
lake
on
the
between
the
head
of
fall
river
which
comes
to
the
columbia
and
the
sacramento
which
goes
to
the
bay
of
san
francisco
and
from
which
lake
a
river
of
the
same
name
makes
its
way
westwardly
direct
to
the
ocean
this
lake
and
river
are
often
called
but
i
have
chosen
to
write
its
name
according
to
the
indian
pronunciation
the
position
of
this
lake
on
the
line
of
inland
communication
between
oregon
and
california
its
proximity
to
the
demarcation
boundary
of
latitude
its
imputed
double
character
of
lake
or
meadow
according
to
the
season
of
the
year
and
the
hostile
and
warlike
character
attributed
to
the
indians
about
it
all
made
it
a
desirable
object
to
visit
and
examine
from
this
lake
our
course
was
intended
to
be
about
southeast
to
a
reported
lake
called
mary
at
some
journey
in
the
great
basin
and
thence
still
on
southeast
to
the
reputed
river
which
has
had
a
place
in
so
many
maps
and
countenanced
the
belief
of
the
existence
of
a
great
river
flowing
from
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
bay
of
san
francisco
from
the
buenaventura
the
next
point
was
intended
to
be
in
that
section
of
the
rocky
mountains
which
includes
the
heads
of
arkansas
river
and
of
the
opposite
waters
of
the
californian
gulf
and
thence
down
the
arkansas
to
bent
fort
and
home
this
was
our
projected
line
of
return
a
great
part
of
it
absolutely
new
to
geographical
botanical
and
geological
science
and
the
subject
of
reports
in
relation
to
lakes
rivers
deserts
and
savages
hardly
above
the
condition
of
mere
wild
animals
which
inflamed
desire
to
know
what
this
really
contained
it
was
a
serious
enterprise
at
the
commencement
of
winter
to
undertake
the
traverse
of
such
a
region
and
with
a
party
consisting
only
of
persons
and
they
of
many
nations
american
french
german
canadian
indian
and
colored
and
most
of
those
young
several
being
under
years
of
age
all
knew
that
a
strange
country
was
to
be
explored
and
dangers
and
hardships
to
be
encountered
but
no
one
blenched
at
the
prospect
on
the
contrary
courage
and
confidence
animated
the
whole
party
cheerfulness
readiness
subordination
prompt
obedience
characterized
all
nor
did
any
extremity
of
peril
and
privation
to
which
we
were
afterwards
exposed
ever
belie
or
derogate
from
the
fine
spirit
of
this
brave
and
generous
commencement
the
course
of
the
narrative
will
show
at
what
point
and
for
what
reasons
we
were
prevented
from
the
complete
execution
of
this
plan
after
having
made
considerable
progress
upon
it
and
how
we
were
forced
by
desert
plains
and
mountain
ranges
and
deep
snows
far
to
the
south
and
near
to
the
pacific
ocean
and
along
the
western
base
of
the
sierra
nevada
where
indeed
a
new
and
ample
field
of
exploration
opened
itself
before
us
for
the
present
we
must
follow
the
narrative
which
will
first
lead
us
south
along
the
valley
of
fall
river
and
the
eastern
base
of
the
cascade
range
to
the
tlamath
lake
from
which
or
its
margin
three
rivers
go
in
three
directions
one
west
to
the
ocean
another
north
to
the
columbia
the
third
south
to
california
for
the
support
of
the
party
i
had
provided
at
vancouver
a
supply
of
provisions
for
not
less
than
three
months
consisting
principally
of
flour
peas
and
tallow
the
latter
being
used
in
cooking
and
in
addition
to
this
i
had
purchased
at
the
mission
some
california
cattle
which
were
to
be
driven
on
the
hoof
we
had
mules
and
horses
part
of
the
latter
procured
from
the
indians
about
the
mission
and
for
the
sustenance
of
which
our
reliance
was
upon
the
grass
which
we
should
find
and
the
soft
porous
wood
which
was
to
be
substituted
when
there
was
none
fitzpatrick
with
talbot
and
the
remainder
of
the
party
arrived
on
the
and
the
camp
was
now
closely
engaged
in
the
labor
of
preparation
perkins
succeeded
in
obtaining
as
a
guide
to
the
tlamath
lake
two
indians
one
of
whom
had
been
there
and
bore
the
marks
of
several
wounds
he
had
received
from
some
of
the
indians
in
the
neighborhood
and
the
other
went
along
for
company
in
order
to
enable
us
to
obtain
horses
he
dispatched
messengers
to
the
various
indian
villages
in
the
neighborhood
informing
them
that
we
were
desirous
to
purchase
and
appointing
a
day
for
them
to
bring
them
in
we
made
in
the
mean
time
several
excursions
in
the
vicinity
perkins
walked
with
preuss
and
myself
to
the
heights
about
nine
miles
distant
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
whence
in
fine
weather
an
extensive
view
may
be
had
over
the
mountains
including
seven
great
peaks
of
the
cascade
range
but
clouds
on
this
occasion
destroyed
the
anticipated
pleasure
and
we
obtained
bearings
only
to
three
that
were
visible
mount
regnier
helens
and
mount
hood
on
the
heights
about
one
mile
south
of
the
mission
a
very
fine
view
may
be
had
of
mount
hood
and
helens
in
order
to
determine
their
position
with
as
much
accuracy
as
possible
the
angular
distances
of
the
peaks
were
measured
with
the
sextant
at
different
fixed
points
from
which
they
could
be
seen
the
indians
brought
in
their
horses
at
the
appointed
time
and
we
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
number
in
exchange
for
goods
but
they
were
relatively
much
higher
here
where
goods
are
plenty
and
at
moderate
prices
than
we
had
found
them
in
the
more
eastern
part
of
our
voyage
several
of
the
indians
inquired
very
anxiously
to
know
if
we
had
any
and
the
horses
we
procured
were
much
fewer
in
number
than
i
had
desired
and
of
thin
inferior
quality
the
oldest
and
poorest
being
those
that
were
sold
to
us
these
horses
as
ever
in
our
journey
you
will
have
occasion
to
remark
are
valuable
for
hardihood
and
great
endurance
at
this
place
one
of
the
men
was
discharged
and
at
the
request
of
perkins
a
chinook
indian
a
lad
of
nineteen
who
was
extremely
desirous
to
see
the
whites
and
make
some
acquaintance
with
our
institutions
was
received
into
the
party
under
my
special
charge
with
the
understanding
that
i
would
again
return
him
to
his
friends
he
had
lived
for
some
time
in
the
household
of
perkins
and
spoke
a
few
words
of
the
english
language
we
were
all
up
early
in
the
excitement
of
turning
towards
home
the
stars
were
brilliant
and
the
morning
cold
the
thermometer
at
daylight
our
preparations
had
been
fully
completed
and
we
commenced
our
journey
the
little
wagon
which
had
hitherto
carried
the
instruments
i
judged
it
necessary
to
abandon
and
it
was
accordingly
presented
to
the
mission
in
all
our
long
traveling
it
had
never
been
overturned
or
injured
by
any
accident
of
the
road
and
the
only
things
broken
were
the
glass
lamps
and
one
of
the
front
panels
which
had
been
kicked
out
by
an
unruly
indian
horse
the
howitzer
was
the
only
wheeled
carriage
now
remaining
we
started
about
noon
when
the
weather
had
become
disagreeably
cold
with
flurries
of
snow
our
friend
perkins
whose
kindness
had
been
active
and
efficient
during
our
stay
accompanied
us
several
miles
on
our
road
when
he
bade
us
farewell
and
consigned
us
to
the
care
of
our
guides
ascending
to
the
uplands
beyond
the
southern
fork
of
the
creek
we
found
the
snow
lying
on
the
ground
in
frequent
patches
although
the
pasture
appeared
good
and
the
new
short
grass
was
fresh
and
green
we
traveled
over
high
hilly
land
and
encamped
on
a
little
branch
of
tinanens
creek
where
there
were
good
grass
and
timber
the
southern
bank
was
covered
with
snow
which
was
scattered
over
the
bottom
and
the
little
creek
its
borders
lined
with
ice
had
a
chilly
and
wintry
look
a
number
of
indians
had
accompanied
us
so
far
on
our
road
and
remained
with
us
during
the
night
two
fellows
who
were
detected
in
stealing
were
tied
and
laid
before
the
fire
and
guard
mounted
over
them
during
the
night
the
night
was
cold
and
partially
clear
the
morning
was
cloudy
and
misty
and
but
a
few
stars
visible
during
the
night
water
froze
in
the
tents
and
at
sunrise
the
thermometer
was
at
left
camp
at
the
road
leading
along
tributaries
of
the
tinanens
and
being
so
far
very
good
we
turned
to
the
right
at
the
fork
of
the
trail
ascending
by
a
steep
ascent
along
a
spur
to
the
dividing
grounds
between
this
stream
and
the
waters
of
fall
river
the
creeks
we
had
passed
were
timbered
principally
with
oak
and
other
deciduous
trees
snow
lies
everywhere
here
on
the
ground
and
we
had
a
slight
fall
during
the
morning
but
towards
noon
the
bright
sky
yielded
to
a
bright
sun
this
morning
we
had
a
grand
view
of
helens
and
regnier
the
latter
appeared
of
a
conical
form
and
very
lofty
leading
the
eye
far
up
into
the
sky
the
line
of
the
timbered
country
is
very
distinctly
marked
here
the
bare
hills
making
with
it
a
remarkable
contrast
the
summit
of
the
ridge
commanded
a
fine
view
of
the
taih
prairie
and
the
stream
running
through
it
which
is
a
tributary
to
the
fall
river
the
chasm
of
which
is
visible
to
the
right
a
steep
descent
of
a
mountain
hill
brought
us
down
into
the
valley
and
we
encamped
on
the
stream
after
dark
guided
by
the
light
of
fires
which
some
naked
indians
belonging
to
a
village
on
the
opposite
side
were
kindling
for
us
on
the
bank
this
is
a
large
branch
of
the
fall
river
there
was
a
broad
band
of
thick
ice
some
fifteen
feet
wide
on
either
bank
and
the
river
current
is
swift
and
bold
the
night
was
cold
and
clear
and
we
made
our
astronomical
observation
this
evening
with
the
thermometer
at
in
anticipation
of
coming
hardship
and
to
spare
our
horses
there
was
much
walking
done
and
fitzpatrick
and
myself
made
the
journey
on
foot
somewhere
near
the
mouth
of
this
stream
are
the
falls
from
which
the
river
takes
its
name
a
fine
view
of
mount
hood
this
morning
a
mass
of
snow
bearing
by
compass
the
sky
is
clear
and
the
air
cold
the
thermometer
below
zero
the
trees
and
bushes
glittering
white
and
the
rapid
stream
filled
with
floating
ice
and
white
two
indian
chiefs
who
had
accompanied
us
thus
far
took
their
leave
and
we
resumed
our
journey
at
we
ascended
by
a
steep
hill
from
the
river
bottom
which
is
sandy
to
a
volcanic
plain
around
which
lofty
hills
sweep
in
a
regular
form
it
is
cut
up
by
gullies
of
basaltic
rock
escarpments
of
which
appear
everywhere
in
the
hills
this
plain
is
called
the
taih
prairie
and
is
sprinkled
with
some
scattered
pines
the
country
is
now
far
more
interesting
to
a
traveler
than
the
route
along
the
snake
and
columbia
rivers
to
our
right
we
had
always
the
mountains
from
the
midst
of
whose
dark
pine
forests
the
isolated
snowy
peaks
were
looking
out
like
giants
they
served
us
for
grand
beacons
to
show
the
rate
at
which
we
advanced
in
our
journey
mount
hood
was
already
becoming
an
old
acquaintance
and
when
we
ascended
the
prairie
we
obtained
a
bearing
to
mount
jefferson
the
indian
superstition
has
peopled
these
lofty
peaks
with
evil
spirits
and
they
have
never
yet
known
the
tread
of
a
human
foot
sternly
drawn
against
the
sky
they
look
so
high
and
steep
so
snowy
and
rocky
that
it
appears
almost
impossible
to
climb
them
but
still
a
trial
would
have
its
attractions
for
the
adventurous
traveler
a
small
trail
takes
off
through
the
prairie
towards
a
low
point
in
the
range
and
perhaps
there
is
here
a
pass
into
the
wahlamette
valley
crossing
the
plain
we
descended
by
a
rocky
hill
into
the
bed
of
a
tributary
of
fall
river
and
made
an
early
encampment
the
water
was
in
holes
and
frozen
over
and
we
were
obliged
to
cut
through
the
ice
for
the
animals
to
drink
an
ox
which
was
rather
troublesome
to
drive
was
killed
here
for
food
the
evening
was
fine
the
sky
being
very
clear
and
i
obtained
an
immersion
of
the
third
satellite
with
a
good
observation
of
an
emersion
of
the
first
the
latter
of
which
gives
for
the
longitude
the
latitude
by
observation
being
the
night
was
cold
the
thermometer
during
the
observations
standing
at
the
sky
was
clear
in
the
morning
but
suddenly
clouded
over
and
at
sunrise
it
began
to
snow
with
the
thermometer
at
we
traversed
a
broken
high
country
partly
timbered
with
pine
and
about
noon
crossed
a
mountainous
ridge
in
which
from
the
rock
occasionally
displayed
the
formation
consists
of
compact
lava
frequent
tracks
of
elk
were
visible
in
the
snow
on
our
right
in
the
afternoon
a
high
plain
partially
covered
with
pine
extended
about
ten
miles
to
the
foot
of
the
cascade
mountains
at
evening
we
encamped
in
a
basin
narrowly
surrounded
by
rocky
hills
after
a
day
journey
of
miles
the
surrounding
rocks
are
either
volcanic
products
or
highly
altered
by
volcanic
action
consisting
of
quartz
and
silicious
masses
we
emerged
from
the
basin
by
a
narrow
pass
upon
a
considerable
branch
of
fall
river
running
to
the
eastward
through
a
narrow
valley
the
trail
descending
this
stream
brought
us
to
a
locality
of
hot
springs
which
were
on
either
bank
those
on
the
left
which
were
formed
into
deep
handsome
basins
would
have
been
delightful
baths
if
the
outer
air
had
not
been
so
keen
the
thermometer
in
these
being
at
there
were
others
on
the
opposite
side
at
the
foot
of
an
escarpment
in
which
the
temperature
of
the
water
was
these
waters
deposited
around
the
spring
a
brecciated
mass
of
quartz
and
feldspar
much
of
it
of
a
reddish
color
we
crossed
the
stream
here
and
ascended
again
to
a
high
plain
from
an
elevated
point
of
which
we
obtained
a
view
of
six
of
the
great
peaks
mount
jefferson
followed
to
the
southward
by
two
others
of
the
same
class
and
succeeding
at
a
still
greater
distance
to
the
southward
were
three
other
lower
peaks
clustering
together
in
a
branch
ridge
these
like
the
great
peaks
were
snowy
masses
secondary
only
to
them
and
from
the
best
examination
our
time
permitted
we
are
inclined
to
believe
that
the
range
to
which
they
belong
is
a
branch
from
the
great
chain
which
here
bears
to
the
westward
the
trail
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
followed
near
to
the
large
stream
on
the
left
which
was
continuously
walled
in
between
high
rocky
banks
we
halted
for
the
night
on
a
little
our
journey
was
short
passing
over
a
high
plain
on
which
were
scattered
cedars
with
frequent
beds
of
volcanic
rock
in
fragments
interspersed
among
the
grassy
grounds
we
arrived
suddenly
on
the
verge
of
the
steep
and
rocky
descent
to
the
valley
of
the
stream
we
had
been
following
and
which
here
ran
directly
across
our
path
emerging
from
the
mountains
on
the
right
you
will
remark
that
the
country
is
abundantly
watered
with
large
streams
which
pour
down
from
the
neighboring
range
these
streams
are
characterized
by
the
narrow
and
valleys
in
which
they
run
generally
sunk
a
thousand
feet
below
the
plain
at
the
verge
of
this
plain
they
frequently
commence
in
vertical
precipices
of
basaltic
rock
and
which
leave
only
casual
places
at
which
they
can
be
entered
by
horses
the
road
across
the
country
which
would
otherwise
be
very
good
is
rendered
impracticable
for
wagons
by
these
streams
there
is
another
trail
among
the
mountains
usually
followed
in
the
summer
which
the
snows
now
compelled
us
to
avoid
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
this
passing
nearer
the
heads
of
these
streams
would
afford
a
much
better
road
at
such
places
the
was
unlimbered
and
separately
descended
by
hand
continuing
a
few
miles
up
the
left
bank
of
the
river
we
encamped
early
in
an
open
bottom
among
the
pines
a
short
distance
below
a
lodge
of
indians
here
along
the
river
the
bluffs
present
escarpments
seven
or
eight
hundred
feet
in
height
containing
strata
of
a
very
fine
porcelain
clay
overlaid
at
the
height
of
about
five
hundred
feet
by
a
massive
stratum
of
compact
basalt
one
hundred
feet
in
thickness
which
again
is
succeeded
above
by
other
strata
of
volcanic
rocks
the
clay
strata
are
variously
colored
some
of
them
very
nearly
as
white
as
chalk
and
very
specimens
brought
from
these
have
been
subjected
to
microscopical
examination
by
professor
bailey
of
west
point
and
are
considered
by
him
to
constitute
one
of
the
most
remarkable
deposites
of
fluviatile
infusoria
on
record
while
they
abound
in
genera
and
species
which
are
common
in
fresh
water
but
which
rarely
thrive
where
the
water
is
even
brackish
not
one
decidedly
marine
form
is
to
be
found
among
them
and
their
origin
is
therefore
beyond
a
doubt
it
is
equally
certain
that
they
lived
and
died
at
the
situation
where
they
were
found
as
they
could
scarcely
have
been
transported
by
running
waters
without
an
admixture
of
sandy
particles
from
which
however
they
are
remarkably
free
fossil
infusoria
of
a
origin
had
been
previously
detected
by
bailey
in
specimens
brought
by
james
dana
from
the
tertiary
formation
of
oregon
most
of
the
species
in
those
specimens
differed
so
much
from
those
now
living
and
known
that
he
was
led
to
infer
that
they
might
belong
to
extinct
species
and
considered
them
also
as
affording
proof
of
an
alteration
in
the
formation
from
which
they
were
obtained
of
fresh
and
deposites
which
common
enough
in
europe
had
not
hitherto
been
noticed
in
the
united
states
coming
evidently
from
a
locality
entirely
different
our
specimens
show
very
few
species
in
common
with
those
brought
by
dana
but
bear
a
much
closer
resemblance
to
those
inhabiting
the
northeastern
states
it
is
possible
that
they
are
from
a
more
recent
deposite
but
the
presence
of
a
few
remarkable
forms
which
are
common
to
the
two
localities
renders
it
more
probable
that
there
is
no
great
difference
in
their
age
i
obtained
here
a
good
observation
of
an
emersion
of
the
second
satellite
but
clouds
which
rapidly
overspread
the
sky
prevented
the
usual
number
of
observations
those
which
we
succeeded
in
obtaining
are
however
good
and
give
for
the
latitude
of
the
place
and
for
the
longitude
from
the
satellite
december
a
short
distance
above
our
encampment
we
crossed
the
river
which
was
thickly
lined
along
its
banks
with
ice
in
common
with
all
these
the
water
was
very
clear
and
the
current
swift
it
was
not
everywhere
fordable
and
the
water
was
three
or
four
feet
deep
at
our
crossing
and
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
wide
as
was
frequently
the
case
at
such
places
one
of
the
mules
got
his
pack
consisting
of
sugar
thoroughly
wet
and
turned
into
molasses
one
of
the
guides
informed
me
that
this
was
a
and
pointed
out
several
places
to
catch
the
fish
among
the
pines
in
the
bottom
i
saw
an
immense
one
about
twelve
feet
in
diameter
a
steep
ascent
from
the
opposite
bank
delayed
us
again
and
as
by
the
information
of
our
guides
grass
would
soon
become
very
scarce
we
encamped
on
the
height
of
land
in
a
marshy
place
among
the
pines
where
there
was
an
abundance
of
grass
we
found
here
a
single
nez
perce
family
who
had
a
very
handsome
horse
in
their
drove
which
we
endeavored
to
obtain
in
exchange
for
a
good
cow
but
the
man
had
two
hearts
or
rather
he
had
one
and
his
wife
had
another
she
wanted
the
cow
but
he
loved
the
horse
too
much
to
part
with
it
these
people
attach
great
value
to
cattle
with
which
they
are
endeavoring
to
supply
themselves
in
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
the
mountain
peaks
this
morning
presented
a
beautiful
appearance
the
snow
being
entirely
covered
with
a
hue
of
rosy
gold
we
traveled
over
a
very
stony
elevated
plain
about
which
were
scattered
cedar
and
pine
and
encamped
on
another
branch
of
fall
river
we
were
gradually
ascending
to
a
more
elevated
region
which
would
have
been
indicated
by
the
rapidly
increasing
quantities
of
snow
and
ice
had
we
not
known
it
by
other
means
a
mule
which
was
packed
with
our
wandered
off
among
the
pines
unperceived
and
several
men
were
sent
back
to
search
for
it
leaving
fitzpatrick
with
the
party
i
went
ahead
with
the
howitzer
and
a
few
men
in
order
to
gain
time
as
our
progress
with
the
gun
was
necessarily
slower
the
country
continued
the
same
very
stony
with
cedar
and
pine
and
we
rode
on
until
dark
when
we
encamped
on
a
covered
with
snow
which
we
used
for
water
as
we
were
unable
to
reach
any
stream
our
animals
had
taken
the
back
track
although
a
great
number
were
hobbled
and
we
were
consequently
delayed
until
noon
shortly
after
we
had
left
this
encampment
the
mountain
trail
from
the
dalles
joined
that
on
which
we
were
traveling
after
passing
for
several
miles
over
an
artemisia
plain
the
trail
entered
a
beautiful
pine
forest
through
which
we
traveled
for
several
hours
and
about
descended
into
the
valley
of
another
large
branch
on
the
bottom
of
which
were
spaces
of
open
pines
with
occasional
meadows
of
good
grass
in
one
of
which
we
encamped
the
stream
is
very
swift
and
deep
and
about
feet
wide
and
nearly
half
frozen
over
among
the
timber
here
are
larches
feet
high
and
over
three
feet
in
diameter
we
had
the
rare
sight
of
a
lunar
rainbow
the
country
was
all
pine
forest
and
beautiful
weather
made
our
journey
delightful
it
was
too
warm
at
noon
for
winter
clothes
and
the
snow
which
lay
everywhere
in
patches
through
the
forest
was
melting
rapidly
after
a
few
hours
ride
we
came
upon
a
fine
stream
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
which
proved
to
be
the
principal
branch
of
the
fall
river
it
was
occasionally
feet
wide
sometimes
narrowed
to
feet
the
waters
very
clear
and
frequently
deep
we
ascended
along
the
river
which
sometimes
presented
sheets
of
foaming
cascades
its
banks
occasionally
blackened
with
masses
of
scoriated
rock
and
found
a
good
encampment
on
the
verge
of
open
bottom
which
had
been
an
old
of
the
cayuse
indians
a
great
number
of
were
lying
about
indicating
game
in
the
neighborhood
the
timber
was
uniformly
large
some
of
the
pines
measuring
feet
in
circumference
at
the
ground
and
to
feet
at
six
feet
above
in
all
our
journeying
we
had
never
traveled
through
a
country
where
the
rivers
were
so
abounding
in
falls
and
the
name
of
this
stream
is
singularly
characteristic
at
every
place
where
we
come
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
river
is
heard
the
roaring
of
falls
the
rock
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
and
the
ledge
over
which
it
falls
is
a
scoriated
basalt
with
a
bright
metallic
fracture
the
stream
goes
over
in
one
clear
pitch
succeeded
by
a
foaming
cataract
of
several
hundred
yards
in
a
little
bottom
above
the
falls
a
small
stream
discharges
into
an
and
disappears
below
we
made
an
early
encampment
and
in
the
course
of
the
evening
fitzpatrick
joined
us
here
with
the
lost
mule
our
were
nearly
worn
out
and
we
found
here
a
handsome
set
leaning
against
one
of
the
trees
very
white
and
cleanly
scraped
had
the
owners
been
here
we
would
have
purchased
them
but
as
they
were
not
we
merely
left
the
old
ones
in
their
place
with
a
small
quantity
of
tobacco
the
morning
was
frosty
and
clear
we
continued
up
the
stream
on
undulating
forest
ground
over
which
there
was
scattered
much
falling
timber
we
met
here
a
village
of
nez
perce
indians
who
appeared
to
be
coming
down
from
the
mountains
and
had
with
them
fine
bands
of
horses
with
them
were
a
few
snake
indians
of
the
species
from
the
forest
we
emerged
into
an
open
valley
ten
or
twelve
miles
wide
through
which
the
stream
was
flowing
tranquilly
upwards
of
two
hundred
feet
broad
with
occasional
islands
and
bordered
with
fine
broad
bottoms
crossing
the
river
which
here
issues
from
a
great
mountain
ridge
on
the
right
we
continued
up
the
southern
and
smaller
branch
over
a
level
country
consisting
of
fine
alternating
with
pine
forests
and
encamped
on
it
early
in
the
evening
a
warm
sunshine
made
the
day
pleasant
we
had
good
traveling
ground
the
trail
leading
sometimes
over
rather
sandy
soils
in
the
pine
forest
and
sometimes
over
along
the
stream
the
great
beauty
of
the
country
in
summer
constantly
suggested
itself
to
our
imaginations
and
even
now
we
found
it
beautiful
as
we
rode
along
these
meadows
from
half
a
mile
to
two
miles
wide
the
rich
soil
and
excellent
water
surrounded
by
noble
forests
make
a
picture
that
would
delight
the
eye
of
a
farmer
i
observed
an
occultation
of
which
although
at
the
bright
limb
of
the
moon
appears
to
give
a
very
good
result
that
has
been
adopted
for
the
longitude
the
occultation
observations
of
satellites
and
our
position
deduced
from
daily
surveys
with
the
compass
agree
remarkably
well
together
and
mutually
support
and
strengthen
each
other
the
latitude
of
the
camp
is
and
longitude
deduced
from
the
occultation
we
crossed
the
last
branch
of
the
fall
river
issuing
like
all
the
others
we
had
crossed
in
a
southwesterly
direction
from
the
mountains
our
direction
was
a
little
east
of
south
the
trail
leading
constantly
through
pine
forests
the
soil
was
generally
bare
consisting
in
greater
part
of
a
producing
varieties
of
magnificent
pines
but
not
a
blade
of
grass
and
our
horses
were
obliged
to
do
without
food
and
use
snow
for
water
these
pines
are
remarkable
for
the
red
color
of
the
bolls
and
among
them
occurs
a
species
of
which
the
indians
had
informed
me
when
leaving
the
dalles
the
unusual
size
of
the
cone
or
inches
long
had
attracted
their
attention
and
they
pointed
it
out
to
me
among
the
curiosities
of
the
country
they
are
more
remarkable
for
their
large
diameter
than
their
height
which
usually
averages
only
about
feet
the
leaflets
are
short
only
two
or
three
inches
long
and
five
in
a
sheath
the
bark
of
a
red
color
the
trail
leads
always
through
splendid
pine
forests
crossing
dividing
grounds
by
a
very
fine
road
we
descended
very
gently
towards
the
south
the
weather
was
pleasant
and
we
halted
late
the
soil
was
very
much
like
that
of
yesterday
and
on
the
surface
of
a
hill
near
our
encampment
were
displayed
beds
of
but
the
soil
produced
no
grass
and
again
the
animals
fared
badly
the
country
began
to
improve
and
about
eleven
we
reached
a
spring
of
cold
water
on
the
edge
of
a
savannah
or
grassy
meadow
which
our
guides
informed
us
was
an
arm
of
the
tlamath
lake
and
a
few
miles
further
we
entered
upon
an
extensive
meadow
or
lake
of
grass
surrounded
by
timbered
mountains
this
was
the
tlamath
lake
it
was
a
picturesque
and
beautiful
spot
and
rendered
more
attractive
to
us
by
the
abundant
and
excellent
grass
which
our
animals
after
traveling
through
pine
forests
so
much
needed
but
the
broad
sheet
of
water
which
constitutes
a
lake
was
not
to
be
seen
overlooking
it
immediately
west
were
several
snowy
knobs
belonging
to
what
we
have
considered
a
branch
of
the
cascade
range
a
low
point
covered
with
pines
made
out
into
the
lake
which
afforded
us
a
good
place
for
an
encampment
and
for
the
security
of
our
horses
which
were
guarded
in
view
on
the
open
meadow
the
character
of
courage
and
hostility
attributed
to
the
indians
in
this
quarter
induced
more
than
usual
precaution
and
seeing
smokes
rising
from
the
middle
of
the
lake
or
savannah
and
along
the
opposite
shores
i
directed
the
howitzer
to
be
fired
it
was
the
first
time
our
guides
had
seen
it
discharged
and
the
bursting
of
the
shell
at
a
distance
which
was
something
like
the
second
fire
of
the
gun
amazed
and
bewildered
them
with
delight
it
inspired
them
with
triumphant
feelings
but
on
the
camps
at
a
distance
the
effect
was
different
for
the
smokes
in
the
lake
and
on
the
shores
immediately
disappeared
the
point
on
which
we
were
encamped
forms
with
the
opposite
eastern
shore
a
narrow
neck
connecting
the
body
of
the
lake
with
a
deep
cove
or
bay
which
receives
the
principal
affluent
stream
and
over
the
greater
part
of
which
the
water
or
rather
ice
was
at
this
time
dispersed
in
shallow
pools
among
the
grass
and
scattered
over
the
prairie
lake
appeared
to
be
similar
marshes
it
is
simply
a
shallow
basin
which
for
a
short
period
at
the
time
of
melting
snows
is
covered
with
water
from
the
neighboring
mountains
but
this
probably
soon
runs
off
and
leaves
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
a
green
savannah
through
the
midst
of
which
the
river
tlamath
which
flows
to
the
ocean
winds
its
way
to
the
outlet
on
the
side
no
indians
made
their
appearance
and
i
determined
to
pay
them
a
visit
accordingly
the
people
were
gathered
together
and
we
rode
out
towards
the
village
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
which
one
of
our
guides
had
previously
visited
it
could
not
be
directly
approached
as
a
large
part
of
the
lake
appeared
a
marsh
and
there
were
sheets
of
ice
among
the
grass
on
which
our
horses
could
not
keep
their
footing
we
therefore
followed
the
guide
for
a
considerable
distance
along
the
forest
and
then
turned
off
towards
the
village
which
we
soon
began
to
see
was
a
few
large
huts
on
the
tops
of
which
were
collected
the
indians
when
we
had
arrived
within
half
a
mile
of
the
village
two
persons
were
seen
advancing
to
meet
us
and
to
please
the
fancy
of
our
guides
we
ranged
ourselves
into
a
long
line
riding
abreast
while
they
galloped
ahead
to
meet
the
strangers
we
were
surprised
on
riding
up
to
find
one
of
them
a
woman
having
never
before
known
a
squaw
to
take
any
part
in
the
business
of
war
they
were
the
village
chief
and
his
wife
who
in
excitement
and
alarm
at
the
unusual
event
and
appearance
had
come
out
to
meet
their
fate
together
the
chief
was
a
very
prepossessing
indian
with
handsome
features
and
a
singularly
soft
and
agreeable
voice
so
remarkable
as
to
attract
general
notice
the
huts
were
grouped
together
on
the
bank
of
the
river
which
from
being
spread
out
in
a
shallow
marsh
at
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
was
collected
here
into
a
single
stream
they
were
large
round
huts
perhaps
feet
in
diameter
with
rounded
tops
on
which
was
the
door
by
which
they
descended
into
the
interior
within
they
were
supported
by
posts
and
beams
almost
like
plants
these
people
seem
to
have
adapted
themselves
to
the
soil
and
to
be
growing
on
what
the
immediate
locality
afforded
their
only
subsistence
at
the
time
appeared
to
be
a
small
fish
great
quantities
of
which
that
had
been
smoked
and
dried
were
suspended
on
strings
about
the
lodge
heaps
of
straw
were
lying
around
and
their
residence
in
the
midst
of
grass
and
rushes
had
taught
them
a
peculiar
skill
in
converting
this
material
to
useful
purposes
their
shoes
were
made
of
straw
or
grass
which
seemed
well
adapted
for
a
snowy
country
and
the
women
wore
on
their
heads
a
basket
which
made
a
very
good
cap
among
other
things
were
mats
about
four
feet
square
which
we
purchased
to
lay
on
the
snow
under
our
blankets
and
to
use
for
numbers
of
dogs
resembling
wolves
were
sitting
on
the
tops
of
the
huts
and
of
these
we
purchased
a
young
one
which
after
its
birthplace
was
named
tlamath
the
language
spoken
by
these
indians
is
different
from
that
of
the
shoshonee
and
columbia
river
tribes
and
otherwise
than
by
signs
they
can
not
understand
each
other
they
made
us
comprehend
that
they
were
at
war
with
the
people
who
lived
to
the
southward
and
to
the
eastward
but
i
could
obtain
from
them
no
certain
information
the
river
on
which
they
live
enters
the
cascade
mountains
on
the
western
side
of
the
lake
and
breaks
through
them
by
a
passage
impracticable
for
travelers
but
over
the
mountains
to
the
northward
are
passes
which
present
no
other
obstacle
than
in
the
almost
impenetrable
forests
unlike
any
indians
we
had
previously
seen
these
wore
shells
in
their
noses
we
returned
to
our
camp
after
remaining
here
an
hour
or
two
accompanied
by
a
number
of
indians
in
order
to
recruit
a
little
the
strength
of
our
animals
and
obtain
some
acquaintance
with
the
locality
we
remained
here
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
by
observation
the
latitude
of
the
camp
was
and
the
diameter
of
the
lake
or
meadow
as
has
been
intimated
about
miles
it
is
a
picturesque
and
beautiful
spot
and
under
the
hand
of
cultivation
might
become
a
little
paradise
game
is
found
in
the
forest
timbered
and
snowy
mountains
skirt
it
and
fertility
characterizes
it
situated
near
the
heads
of
three
rivers
and
on
the
line
of
inland
communication
with
california
and
near
to
indians
noted
for
treachery
it
will
naturally
in
the
progress
of
the
settlement
of
oregon
become
a
point
for
military
occupation
and
settlement
from
tlamath
lake
the
further
continuation
of
our
voyage
assumed
a
character
of
discovery
and
exploration
which
from
the
indians
here
we
could
obtain
no
information
to
direct
and
where
the
imaginary
maps
of
the
country
instead
of
assisting
exposed
us
to
suffering
and
defeat
in
our
journey
across
the
desert
mary
lake
and
the
famous
buenaventura
river
were
two
points
on
which
i
relied
to
recruit
the
animals
and
repose
the
party
forming
agreeably
to
the
best
maps
in
my
possession
a
connected
from
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
pacific
ocean
i
felt
no
other
anxiety
than
to
pass
safely
across
the
intervening
desert
to
the
banks
of
the
buenaventura
where
in
the
softer
climate
of
a
more
southern
latitude
our
horses
might
find
grass
to
sustain
them
and
ourselves
be
sheltered
from
the
rigors
of
winter
and
from
the
inhospitable
desert
the
guides
who
had
conducted
us
thus
far
on
our
journey
were
about
to
return
and
i
endeavored
in
vain
to
obtain
others
to
lead
us
even
for
a
few
days
in
the
direction
east
which
we
wished
to
go
the
chief
to
whom
i
applied
alleged
the
want
of
horses
and
the
snow
on
the
mountains
across
which
our
course
would
carry
us
and
the
sickness
of
his
family
as
reasons
for
refusing
to
go
with
us
this
morning
the
camp
was
thronged
with
tlamath
indians
from
the
southeastern
shore
of
the
lake
but
knowing
the
treacherous
disposition
which
is
a
remarkable
characteristic
of
the
indians
south
of
the
columbia
the
camp
was
kept
constantly
on
its
guard
i
was
not
unmindful
of
the
disasters
which
smith
and
other
travelers
had
met
with
in
this
country
and
therefore
was
equally
vigilant
in
guarding
against
treachery
and
violence
according
to
the
best
information
i
had
been
able
to
obtain
from
the
indians
in
a
few
days
traveling
we
should
reach
another
large
water
probably
a
lake
which
they
indicated
exactly
in
the
course
we
were
about
to
pursue
we
struck
our
tents
at
and
crossed
the
lake
in
a
nearly
east
direction
where
it
has
the
least
extension
the
breadth
of
the
arm
being
here
only
about
a
mile
and
a
half
there
were
ponds
of
ice
with
but
little
grass
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way
and
it
was
difficult
to
get
the
across
which
fell
frequently
and
could
not
get
up
with
their
loads
unassisted
the
morning
was
very
unpleasant
snow
falling
at
intervals
in
large
flakes
and
the
sky
dark
in
about
two
hours
we
succeeded
in
getting
the
animals
over
and
after
traveling
another
hour
along
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
we
turned
up
into
a
cove
where
there
was
a
sheltered
place
among
the
timber
with
good
grass
and
encamped
the
indians
who
had
accompanied
us
so
far
returned
to
their
village
on
the
shore
among
the
pines
here
i
noticed
some
five
or
six
feet
in
diameter
the
night
has
been
cold
the
peaks
around
the
lake
gleam
out
brightly
in
the
morning
sun
and
the
thermometer
is
at
zero
we
continued
up
the
hollow
formed
by
a
small
affluent
to
the
lake
and
immediately
entered
an
open
pine
forest
on
the
mountain
the
way
here
was
sometimes
obstructed
by
fallen
trees
and
the
snow
was
four
to
twelve
inches
deep
the
mules
at
the
gun
pulled
heavily
and
walking
was
a
little
laborious
in
the
midst
of
the
wood
we
heard
the
sound
of
galloping
horses
and
were
agreeably
surprised
by
the
unexpected
arrival
of
our
tlamath
chief
with
several
indians
he
seemed
to
have
found
his
conduct
inhospitable
in
letting
the
strangers
depart
without
a
guide
through
the
snow
and
had
come
with
a
few
others
to
pilot
us
a
day
or
two
on
the
way
after
traveling
in
an
easterly
direction
through
the
forest
for
about
four
hours
we
reached
a
considerable
stream
with
a
border
of
good
grass
and
here
by
the
advice
of
our
guides
we
encamped
it
is
about
thirty
feet
wide
and
two
to
four
feet
deep
the
water
clear
with
some
current
and
according
to
the
information
of
our
indians
is
the
principal
affluent
to
the
lake
and
the
of
the
tlamath
river
a
very
clear
sky
enabled
me
to
obtain
here
good
observations
including
an
emersion
of
the
first
satellite
of
jupiter
which
gave
for
the
long
and
for
the
lat
this
emersion
coincides
remarkably
well
with
the
result
obtained
from
an
occultation
at
the
encampment
of
december
to
from
which
place
the
line
of
our
survey
gives
an
easting
of
miles
the
day
journey
was
miles
our
road
was
over
a
broad
mountain
and
we
rode
seven
hours
in
a
thick
always
through
pine
forests
when
we
came
down
upon
the
of
another
stream
on
which
there
was
grass
the
snow
lay
deep
on
the
ground
and
only
the
high
appeared
above
the
indians
were
thinly
clad
and
i
had
remarked
during
the
day
that
they
suffered
from
cold
this
evening
they
told
me
that
the
snow
was
getting
too
deep
on
the
mountain
and
i
could
not
induce
them
to
go
any
farther
the
stream
we
had
struck
issued
from
the
mountain
in
an
easterly
direction
turning
to
the
southward
a
short
distance
below
and
drawing
its
course
upon
the
ground
they
made
us
comprehend
that
it
pursued
its
way
for
a
long
distance
in
that
direction
uniting
with
many
other
streams
and
gradually
becoming
a
great
river
without
the
subsequent
information
which
confirmed
the
opinion
we
became
immediately
satisfied
that
this
water
formed
the
principal
stream
of
the
sacramento
river
and
consequently
that
this
main
affluent
of
the
bay
of
san
francisco
had
its
source
within
the
limits
of
the
united
states
and
opposite
a
tributary
to
the
columbia
and
near
the
head
of
the
tlamath
river
which
goes
to
the
ocean
north
of
and
within
the
united
states
a
present
consisting
of
useful
goods
afforded
much
satisfaction
to
our
guides
and
showing
them
the
national
flag
i
explained
that
it
was
a
symbol
of
our
nation
and
they
engaged
always
to
receive
it
in
a
friendly
manner
the
chief
pointed
out
a
course
by
following
which
we
would
arrive
at
the
big
water
where
no
more
snow
was
to
be
found
traveling
in
a
direction
by
compass
which
the
indians
informed
me
would
avoid
a
bad
mountain
to
the
right
we
crossed
the
sacramento
where
it
turned
to
the
southward
and
entered
a
grassy
level
plain
a
smaller
grand
rond
from
the
lower
end
of
which
the
river
issued
into
an
inviting
country
of
low
rolling
hills
crossing
a
swamp
on
the
farther
side
of
the
rond
we
entered
again
the
pine
forest
in
which
very
deep
snow
made
our
traveling
slow
and
laborious
we
were
slowly
but
gradually
ascending
a
mountain
and
after
a
hard
journey
of
seven
hours
we
came
to
some
naked
places
among
the
timber
where
a
few
tufts
of
grass
showed
above
the
snow
on
the
side
of
a
hollow
and
here
we
encamped
our
cow
which
every
day
got
poorer
was
killed
here
but
the
meat
was
rather
tough
we
traveled
this
morning
through
snow
about
three
feet
deep
which
being
crusted
very
much
cut
the
feet
of
our
animals
the
mountain
still
gradually
rose
we
crossed
several
spring
heads
covered
with
quaking
asp
otherwise
it
was
all
pine
forest
the
air
was
dark
with
falling
snow
which
everywhere
weighed
down
the
trees
the
depths
of
the
forest
were
profoundly
still
and
below
we
scarcely
felt
a
breath
of
the
wind
which
whirled
the
snow
through
their
branches
i
found
that
it
required
some
exertion
of
constancy
to
adhere
steadily
to
one
course
through
the
woods
when
we
were
uncertain
how
far
the
forest
extended
or
what
lay
beyond
and
on
account
of
our
animals
it
would
be
bad
to
spend
another
night
on
the
mountain
towards
noon
the
forest
looked
clear
ahead
appearing
suddenly
to
terminate
and
beyond
a
certain
point
we
could
see
no
trees
riding
rapidly
ahead
to
this
spot
we
found
ourselves
on
the
verge
of
a
vertical
and
rocky
wall
of
the
mountain
at
our
feet
more
than
a
thousand
feet
below
we
looked
into
a
green
prairie
country
in
which
a
beautiful
lake
some
twenty
miles
in
length
was
spread
along
the
foot
of
the
mountains
its
shores
bordered
with
green
grass
just
then
the
sun
broke
out
among
the
clouds
and
illuminated
the
country
below
while
around
us
the
storm
raged
fiercely
not
a
particle
of
ice
was
to
be
seen
on
the
lake
or
snow
on
its
borders
and
all
was
like
summer
or
spring
the
glow
of
the
sun
in
the
valley
below
brightened
up
our
hearts
with
sudden
pleasure
and
we
made
the
woods
ring
with
joyful
shouts
to
those
behind
and
gradually
as
each
came
up
he
stopped
to
enjoy
the
unexpected
scene
shivering
on
snow
three
feet
deep
and
stiffening
in
a
cold
north
wind
we
exclaimed
at
once
that
the
names
of
summer
lake
and
winter
ridge
should
be
applied
to
these
two
proximate
places
of
such
sudden
and
violent
contrast
we
were
now
immediately
on
the
verge
of
the
forest
land
in
which
we
had
been
traveling
so
many
days
and
looking
forward
to
the
east
scarce
a
tree
was
to
be
seen
viewed
from
our
elevation
the
face
of
the
country
exhibited
only
rocks
and
grass
and
presented
a
region
in
which
the
artemisia
became
the
principal
wood
furnishing
to
its
scattered
inhabitants
fuel
for
their
fires
building
material
for
their
huts
and
shelter
for
the
small
game
which
ministers
to
their
hunger
and
nakedness
broadly
marked
by
the
boundary
at
the
mountain
wall
and
immediately
below
us
were
the
first
waters
of
that
great
interior
basin
which
has
the
wahsatch
and
bear
river
mountains
for
its
eastern
and
the
sierra
nevada
for
its
western
rim
and
the
edge
of
which
we
had
entered
upwards
of
three
months
before
at
the
great
salt
lake
when
we
had
sufficiently
admired
the
scene
below
we
began
to
think
about
descending
which
here
was
impossible
and
we
turned
towards
the
north
traveling
always
along
the
rocky
wall
we
continued
on
for
four
or
five
miles
making
ineffectual
attempts
at
several
places
and
at
length
succeeded
in
getting
down
at
one
which
was
extremely
difficult
of
descent
night
had
closed
in
before
the
foremost
reached
the
bottom
and
it
was
dark
before
we
all
found
ourselves
together
in
the
valley
there
were
three
or
four
dry
on
the
shore
and
those
who
first
arrived
kindled
bright
fires
to
light
on
the
others
one
of
the
mules
rolled
over
and
over
two
or
three
hundred
feet
into
a
ravine
but
recovered
himself
without
any
other
injury
than
to
his
pack
and
the
howitzer
was
left
midway
the
mountain
until
morning
by
observation
the
latitude
of
this
encampment
is
it
delayed
us
until
near
noon
the
next
day
to
recover
ourselves
and
put
every
thing
in
order
and
we
made
only
a
short
camp
along
the
western
shore
of
the
lake
which
in
the
summer
temperature
we
enjoyed
justified
the
name
we
had
given
it
our
course
would
have
taken
us
to
the
other
shore
and
over
the
highlands
beyond
but
i
distrusted
the
appearance
of
the
country
and
decided
to
follow
a
indian
trail
leading
along
this
side
of
the
lake
we
were
now
in
a
country
where
the
scarcity
of
water
and
of
grass
makes
traveling
dangerous
and
great
caution
was
necessary
we
continued
on
the
trail
along
the
narrow
strip
of
land
between
the
lake
and
the
high
rocky
wall
from
which
we
had
looked
down
two
days
before
almost
every
half
mile
we
crossed
a
little
spring
or
stream
of
pure
cold
water
and
the
grass
was
certainly
as
fresh
and
green
as
in
the
early
spring
from
the
white
efflorescence
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
we
were
enabled
to
judge
that
the
water
was
impure
like
that
of
lakes
we
subsequently
found
but
the
mud
prevented
us
from
approaching
it
we
encamped
near
the
eastern
point
of
the
lake
where
there
appeared
between
the
hills
a
broad
and
low
connecting
hollow
with
the
country
beyond
from
a
rocky
hill
in
the
rear
i
could
see
marked
out
by
a
line
of
yellow
dried
grass
the
bed
of
a
stream
which
probably
connected
the
lake
with
other
waters
in
the
spring
the
observed
latitude
of
this
encampment
is
after
two
hours
ride
in
an
easterly
direction
through
a
low
country
the
high
ridge
with
pine
forest
still
to
our
right
and
a
rocky
and
bald
but
lower
one
on
the
left
we
reached
a
considerable
stream
which
issues
from
the
piny
mountains
so
far
as
we
had
been
able
to
judge
between
this
stream
and
the
lake
we
had
crossed
dividing
grounds
and
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
connection
as
might
be
inferred
from
the
impure
condition
of
the
lake
water
the
rapid
stream
of
pure
water
roaring
along
between
banks
overhung
with
aspens
and
willows
was
a
refreshing
and
unexpected
sight
and
we
followed
down
the
course
of
the
stream
which
brought
us
soon
into
a
marsh
or
dry
lake
formed
by
the
expanding
waters
of
the
stream
it
was
covered
with
high
reeds
and
rushes
and
large
patches
of
ground
had
been
turned
up
by
the
squaws
in
digging
for
roots
as
if
a
farmer
had
been
preparing
the
land
for
grain
i
could
not
succeed
in
finding
the
plant
for
which
they
had
been
digging
there
were
frequent
trails
and
fresh
tracks
of
indians
and
from
the
abundant
signs
visible
the
hare
appears
to
be
numerous
here
it
was
evident
that
in
other
seasons
this
place
was
a
sheet
of
water
crossing
this
marsh
towards
the
eastern
hills
and
passing
over
a
bordering
plain
of
heavy
sands
covered
with
artemisia
we
encamped
before
sundown
on
the
creek
which
here
was
very
small
having
lost
its
water
in
the
marshy
grounds
we
found
here
tolerably
good
grass
the
wind
was
high
and
we
had
no
longer
our
huge
pine
fires
but
were
driven
to
our
old
resource
of
small
dried
willows
and
artemisia
about
miles
ahead
the
valley
appears
to
be
closed
in
by
a
high
ridge
traveling
for
a
few
hours
down
the
stream
this
morning
we
turned
the
point
of
a
hill
on
our
left
and
came
suddenly
in
sight
of
another
and
much
larger
lake
which
along
its
eastern
shore
was
closely
bordered
by
the
high
black
ridge
which
walled
it
in
by
a
precipitous
face
on
this
side
throughout
this
region
the
face
of
the
country
is
characterized
by
these
precipices
of
black
volcanic
rock
generally
enclosing
the
valleys
of
streams
and
frequently
terminating
the
hills
often
in
the
course
of
our
journey
we
would
be
tempted
to
continue
our
road
up
the
gentle
ascent
of
a
sloping
hill
which
at
the
summit
would
terminate
abruptly
in
a
black
precipice
spread
out
over
a
length
of
miles
the
lake
when
we
first
came
in
view
presented
a
handsome
sheet
of
water
and
i
gave
to
it
the
name
of
lake
abert
in
honor
of
the
chief
of
the
corps
to
which
i
belonged
the
stream
we
had
followed
emptied
into
the
lake
by
a
little
fall
and
i
was
doubtful
for
a
moment
whether
to
go
on
or
encamp
at
this
place
the
miry
ground
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
lake
did
not
allow
us
to
examine
the
water
conveniently
and
being
now
on
the
borders
of
a
desert
country
we
were
moving
cautiously
it
was
however
still
early
in
the
day
and
i
continued
on
trusting
either
that
the
water
would
be
drinkable
or
that
we
should
find
some
little
spring
from
the
we
were
following
an
indian
trail
which
led
along
the
steep
rocky
precipice
a
black
ridge
along
the
western
shore
holding
out
no
prospect
whatever
the
white
efflorescences
which
lined
the
shore
like
a
bank
of
snow
and
the
disagreeable
odor
which
filled
the
air
as
soon
as
we
came
near
informed
us
too
plainly
that
the
water
belonged
to
one
of
those
fetid
salt
lakes
which
are
common
in
this
region
we
continued
until
late
in
the
evening
to
work
along
the
rocky
shore
but
as
often
afterwards
the
dry
inhospitable
rock
deceived
us
and
halting
on
the
lake
we
kindled
up
fires
to
guide
those
who
were
straggling
along
behind
we
tried
the
water
but
it
was
impossible
to
drink
it
and
most
of
the
people
lay
down
without
eating
but
some
of
us
who
had
always
a
great
reluctance
to
close
the
day
without
supper
dug
holes
along
the
shore
and
obtained
water
which
being
filtered
was
sufficiently
palatable
to
be
used
but
still
retained
much
of
its
nauseating
taste
there
was
very
little
grass
for
the
animals
the
shore
being
lined
with
a
luxuriant
growth
of
chenopodiaceous
shrubs
which
burned
with
a
quick
bright
flame
and
made
our
firewood
the
next
morning
we
had
scarcely
traveled
two
hours
along
the
shore
when
we
reached
a
place
where
the
mountains
made
a
bay
leaving
at
their
feet
a
low
bottom
around
the
lake
here
we
found
numerous
hillocks
covered
with
rushes
in
the
midst
of
which
were
deep
holes
or
springs
of
pure
water
and
the
bottom
was
covered
with
grass
which
although
of
a
salt
and
unwholesome
quality
and
mixed
with
saline
efflorescences
was
still
abundant
and
made
a
good
to
recruit
our
animals
and
we
accordingly
encamped
here
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
i
rode
ahead
several
miles
to
ascertain
if
there
was
any
appearance
of
a
entering
the
lake
but
found
none
the
hills
preserving
their
dry
character
and
the
shore
of
the
lake
sprinkled
with
the
same
white
powdery
substance
and
covered
with
the
same
shrubs
there
were
flocks
of
ducks
on
the
lake
and
frequent
tracks
of
indians
along
the
shore
where
the
grass
had
been
recently
burnt
by
their
fires
we
ascended
the
bordering
mountain
in
order
to
obtain
a
more
perfect
view
of
the
lake
in
sketching
its
figure
hills
sweep
entirely
around
its
basin
from
which
the
waters
have
no
outlet
we
left
this
forbidding
lake
impassable
rocky
ridges
barred
our
progress
to
the
eastward
and
i
accordingly
bore
off
towards
the
south
over
an
extensive
at
a
considerable
distance
ahead
and
a
little
on
our
left
was
a
range
of
snowy
mountains
and
the
country
declined
gradually
towards
the
foot
of
a
high
and
nearer
ridge
immediately
before
us
which
presented
the
feature
of
black
precipices
now
becoming
common
to
the
country
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
snow
was
visible
and
there
being
every
indication
of
a
stream
at
its
base
we
rode
on
until
after
dark
but
were
unable
to
reach
it
and
halted
among
the
on
the
open
plain
without
either
grass
or
water
the
two
bags
had
been
filled
with
water
in
the
morning
which
afforded
sufficient
for
the
camp
and
rain
in
the
night
formed
pools
which
relieved
the
thirst
of
the
animals
where
we
encamped
on
the
bleak
sandy
plain
the
indians
had
made
huts
or
circular
enclosures
about
four
feet
high
and
twelve
feet
broad
of
artemisia
bushes
whether
these
had
been
forts
or
houses
or
what
they
had
been
doing
in
such
a
desert
place
we
could
not
ascertain
the
weather
is
mild
the
thermometer
at
daylight
the
wind
having
been
from
the
southward
for
several
days
the
country
has
a
very
forbidding
appearance
presenting
to
the
eye
nothing
but
sage
and
barren
ridges
we
rode
up
towards
the
mountain
along
the
foot
of
which
we
found
a
lake
that
we
could
not
approach
on
account
of
the
mud
and
passing
around
its
southern
end
ascended
the
slope
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
where
in
some
hollows
we
had
discovered
bushes
and
small
trees
in
such
situations
a
sure
sign
of
water
we
found
here
several
springs
and
the
was
well
sprinkled
with
a
species
of
a
better
grass
than
we
had
found
for
many
days
our
elevated
position
gave
us
a
good
view
over
the
country
but
we
discovered
nothing
very
encouraging
southward
about
ten
miles
distant
was
another
small
lake
towards
which
a
broad
trail
led
along
the
ridge
and
this
appearing
to
afford
the
most
practicable
route
i
determined
to
continue
our
journey
in
that
direction
we
found
the
water
at
the
lake
tolerably
pure
and
encamped
at
the
farther
end
there
were
some
good
grass
and
canes
along
the
shore
and
the
vegetables
at
this
place
consisted
principally
of
chenopodiaceous
shrubs
we
were
roused
on
christmas
morning
by
a
discharge
from
the
and
howitzer
with
which
our
people
saluted
the
day
and
the
name
of
which
we
bestowed
on
the
lake
it
was
the
first
time
perhaps
in
this
remote
and
desolate
region
in
which
it
had
been
so
commemorated
always
on
days
of
religious
or
national
commemoration
our
voyageurs
expect
some
unusual
allowance
and
having
nothing
else
i
gave
them
each
a
little
brandy
which
was
carefully
guarded
as
one
of
the
most
useful
articles
a
traveler
can
carry
with
some
coffee
and
sugar
which
here
where
every
eatable
was
a
luxury
was
sufficient
to
make
them
a
feast
the
day
was
sunny
and
warm
and
resuming
our
journey
we
crossed
some
slight
dividing
grounds
into
a
similar
basin
walled
in
on
the
right
by
a
lofty
mountain
ridge
the
trail
still
continued
and
occasionally
we
passed
of
the
indians
which
indicated
to
me
that
we
were
on
one
of
the
great
thoroughfares
of
the
country
in
the
afternoon
i
attempted
to
travel
in
a
more
eastern
direction
but
after
a
few
laborious
miles
was
beaten
back
into
the
basin
by
an
impassable
country
there
were
fresh
indian
tracks
about
the
valley
and
last
night
a
horse
was
stolen
we
encamped
on
the
valley
bottom
where
there
was
some
water
in
ponds
colored
by
a
clay
soil
and
frozen
over
chenopodiaceous
shrubs
constituted
the
growth
and
made
again
our
firewood
the
animals
were
driven
to
the
hill
where
there
was
tolerably
good
grass
our
general
course
was
again
south
the
country
consists
of
larger
or
smaller
basins
into
which
the
mountain
waters
run
down
forming
small
lakes
they
present
a
perfect
level
from
which
the
mountains
rise
immediately
and
abruptly
between
the
successive
basins
the
dividing
grounds
are
usually
very
slight
and
it
is
probable
that
in
the
seasons
of
high
water
many
of
these
basins
are
in
communication
at
such
times
there
is
evidently
an
abundance
of
water
though
now
we
find
scarcely
more
than
the
dry
beds
on
either
side
the
mountains
though
not
very
high
appear
to
be
rocky
and
sterile
the
basin
in
which
we
were
traveling
declined
towards
the
southwest
corner
where
the
mountains
indicated
a
narrow
outlet
and
turning
round
a
rocky
point
or
cape
we
continued
up
a
lateral
branch
valley
in
which
we
encamped
at
night
on
a
rapid
pretty
little
stream
of
fresh
water
which
we
found
unexpectedly
among
the
sage
near
the
ridge
on
the
right
side
of
the
valley
it
was
bordered
with
grassy
bottoms
and
clumps
of
willows
the
water
partially
frozen
this
stream
belongs
to
the
basin
we
had
left
by
a
partial
observation
our
camp
was
found
to
be
directly
on
the
parallel
a
horse
belonging
to
carson
one
of
the
best
we
had
in
the
camp
was
stolen
by
the
indians
we
continued
up
the
valley
of
the
stream
the
principal
branch
of
which
here
issues
from
a
bed
of
high
mountains
we
turned
up
a
branch
to
the
left
and
fell
into
an
indian
trail
which
conducted
us
by
a
good
road
over
open
bottoms
along
the
creek
where
the
snow
was
five
or
six
inches
deep
gradually
ascending
the
trail
led
through
a
good
broad
pass
in
the
mountain
where
we
found
the
snow
about
one
foot
deep
there
were
some
remarkably
large
cedars
in
the
pass
which
were
covered
with
an
unusual
quantity
of
frost
which
we
supposed
might
possibly
indicate
the
neighborhood
of
water
and
as
in
the
arbitrary
position
of
mary
lake
we
were
already
beginning
to
look
for
it
this
circumstance
contributed
to
our
hope
of
finding
it
near
descending
from
the
mountain
we
reached
another
basin
on
the
flat
lake
bed
of
which
we
found
no
water
and
encamped
among
the
sage
on
the
bordering
plain
where
the
snow
was
still
about
one
foot
deep
among
this
the
grass
was
remarkably
green
and
the
animals
fared
tolerably
well
the
snow
being
deep
i
had
determined
if
any
more
horses
were
stolen
to
follow
the
tracks
of
the
indians
into
the
mountains
and
put
a
temporary
check
to
their
sly
operations
but
it
did
not
occur
again
our
road
this
morning
lay
down
a
level
valley
bordered
by
steep
mountainous
ridges
rising
very
abruptly
from
the
plain
artemisia
was
the
principal
plant
mingled
with
fremontia
and
the
chenopodiaceous
shrubs
the
artemisia
was
here
extremely
large
being
sometimes
a
foot
in
diameter
and
eight
feet
high
riding
quietly
along
over
the
snow
we
came
suddenly
upon
smokes
rising
among
these
bushes
and
galloping
up
we
found
two
huts
open
at
the
top
and
loosely
built
of
sage
which
appeared
to
have
been
deserted
at
the
instant
and
looking
hastily
around
we
saw
several
indians
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
near
by
and
several
others
scrambling
up
the
side
we
had
come
upon
them
so
suddenly
that
they
had
been
surprised
in
their
lodges
a
sage
fire
was
burning
in
the
middle
a
few
baskets
made
of
straw
were
lying
about
with
one
or
two
and
there
was
a
little
grass
scattered
about
on
which
they
had
been
lying
tabibo
bo
they
shouted
from
the
hills
a
word
which
in
the
snake
language
signifies
and
remained
looking
at
us
from
behind
the
rocks
carson
and
godey
rode
towards
the
hill
but
the
men
ran
off
like
deer
they
had
been
so
much
pressed
that
a
woman
with
two
children
had
dropped
behind
a
near
the
lodge
and
when
carson
accidentally
stumbled
upon
her
she
immediately
began
screaming
in
the
extremity
of
fear
and
shut
her
eyes
fast
to
avoid
seeing
him
she
was
brought
back
to
the
lodge
and
we
endeavored
in
vain
to
open
a
communication
with
the
men
by
dint
of
presents
and
friendly
demonstrations
she
was
brought
to
calmness
and
we
found
that
they
belonged
to
the
snake
nation
speaking
the
language
of
that
people
eight
or
ten
appeared
to
live
together
under
the
same
little
shelter
and
they
seemed
to
have
no
other
subsistence
than
the
roots
or
seeds
they
might
have
stored
up
and
the
hares
which
live
in
the
sage
and
which
they
are
enabled
to
track
through
the
snow
and
are
very
skilful
in
killing
their
skins
afford
them
a
little
scanty
covering
herding
together
among
bushes
and
crouching
almost
naked
over
a
little
sage
fire
using
their
instinct
only
to
procure
food
these
may
be
considered
among
human
beings
the
nearest
approach
to
the
animal
creation
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
these
had
never
before
seen
the
face
of
a
white
man
the
day
had
been
pleasant
but
about
two
it
began
to
blow
and
crossing
a
slight
dividing
ground
we
encamped
on
the
sheltered
side
of
a
hill
where
there
was
good
having
made
a
day
journey
of
miles
the
night
closed
in
threatening
snow
but
the
large
made
bright
fires
the
morning
mild
and
at
it
commenced
snowing
we
took
our
way
across
a
plain
thickly
covered
with
snow
towards
a
range
of
hills
in
the
southeast
the
sky
soon
became
so
dark
with
snow
that
little
could
be
seen
of
the
surrounding
country
and
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
hills
in
a
heavy
on
the
side
we
had
approached
this
had
appeared
to
be
only
a
ridge
of
low
hills
and
we
were
surprised
to
find
ourselves
on
the
summit
of
a
bed
of
broken
mountains
which
as
far
as
the
weather
would
permit
us
to
see
declined
rapidly
to
some
low
country
ahead
presenting
a
dreary
and
savage
character
and
for
a
moment
i
looked
around
in
doubt
on
the
wild
and
inhospitable
prospect
scarcely
knowing
what
road
to
take
which
might
conduct
us
to
some
place
of
shelter
for
the
night
noticing
among
the
hills
the
head
of
a
grassy
hollow
i
determined
to
follow
it
in
the
hope
that
it
would
conduct
us
to
a
stream
we
followed
a
winding
descent
for
several
miles
the
hollow
gradually
broadening
into
little
meadows
and
becoming
the
bed
of
a
stream
as
we
advanced
and
towards
night
we
were
agreeably
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
a
willow
grove
where
we
found
a
sheltered
camp
with
water
and
excellent
and
abundant
grass
the
grass
which
was
covered
by
the
snow
on
the
bottom
was
long
and
green
and
the
face
of
the
mountain
had
a
more
favorable
character
in
its
vegetation
being
smoother
and
covered
with
good
the
snow
was
deep
and
the
night
very
cold
a
broad
trail
had
entered
the
valley
from
the
right
and
a
short
distance
below
the
camp
were
the
tracks
where
a
considerable
party
of
indians
had
passed
on
horseback
who
had
turned
out
to
the
left
apparently
with
the
view
of
crossing
the
mountains
to
the
eastward
after
following
the
stream
for
a
few
hours
in
a
southeasterly
direction
it
entered
a
canon
where
we
could
not
follow
but
determined
not
to
leave
the
stream
we
searched
a
passage
below
where
we
could
regain
it
and
entered
a
regular
narrow
valley
the
water
had
now
more
the
appearance
of
a
flowing
creek
several
times
we
passed
groves
of
willows
and
we
began
to
feel
ourselves
out
of
all
difficulty
from
our
position
it
was
reasonable
to
conclude
that
this
stream
would
find
its
outlet
in
mary
lake
and
conduct
us
into
a
better
country
we
had
descended
rapidly
and
here
we
found
very
little
snow
on
both
sides
the
mountains
showed
often
stupendous
and
rocks
which
at
several
places
so
narrowed
the
valley
that
scarcely
a
pass
was
left
for
the
camp
it
was
a
singular
place
to
travel
through
shut
up
in
the
earth
a
sort
of
chasm
the
little
strip
of
grass
under
our
feet
the
rough
walls
of
bare
rock
on
either
hand
and
the
narrow
strip
of
sky
above
the
grass
was
abundant
and
we
encamped
in
high
spirits
after
an
hour
ride
this
morning
our
hopes
were
once
more
destroyed
the
valley
opened
out
and
before
us
again
lay
one
of
the
dry
basins
after
some
search
we
discovered
a
outlet
which
brought
us
in
a
few
miles
and
by
a
descent
of
several
hundred
feet
into
a
long
broad
basin
in
which
we
found
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
obtained
sufficient
water
by
cutting
the
ice
the
grass
on
the
bottoms
was
salt
and
unpalatable
here
we
concluded
the
year
and
our
new
year
eve
was
rather
a
gloomy
one
the
result
of
our
journey
began
to
be
very
uncertain
the
country
was
singularly
unfavorable
to
travel
the
grasses
being
frequently
of
a
very
unwholesome
character
and
the
hoofs
of
our
animals
were
so
worn
and
cut
by
the
rocks
that
many
of
them
were
lame
and
could
scarcely
be
got
along
january
new
year
day
we
continued
down
the
valley
between
a
black
ridge
on
the
left
and
a
more
snowy
and
high
one
on
the
right
our
road
was
bad
along
the
bottom
being
broken
by
gullies
and
impeded
by
sage
and
sandy
on
the
hills
where
there
is
not
a
blade
of
grass
nor
does
any
appear
on
the
mountains
the
soil
in
many
places
consists
of
a
fine
powdery
sand
covered
with
a
saline
efflorescence
and
the
general
character
of
the
country
is
desert
during
the
day
we
directed
our
course
towards
a
black
cape
at
the
foot
of
which
a
column
of
smoke
indicated
hot
springs
we
were
on
the
road
early
the
face
of
the
country
was
hidden
by
falling
snow
we
traveled
along
the
bed
of
the
stream
in
some
places
dry
in
others
covered
with
ice
the
traveling
being
very
bad
through
deep
fine
sand
rendered
tenacious
by
a
mixture
of
clay
the
weather
cleared
up
a
little
at
noon
and
we
reached
the
hot
springs
of
which
we
had
seen
the
vapor
the
day
before
there
was
a
large
field
of
the
usual
salt
grass
here
peculiar
to
such
places
the
country
otherwise
is
a
perfect
barren
without
a
blade
of
grass
the
only
plant
being
some
dwarf
fremontias
we
passed
the
rocky
cape
a
jagged
broken
point
bare
and
torn
the
rocks
are
volcanic
and
the
hills
here
have
a
burnt
appearance
cinders
and
coal
occasionally
appearing
as
at
a
blacksmith
forge
we
crossed
the
large
dry
bed
of
a
muddy
lake
in
a
southeasterly
direction
and
encamped
at
night
without
water
and
without
grass
among
covered
with
snow
the
heavy
road
made
several
mules
give
out
and
a
horse
which
had
made
the
journey
from
the
states
successfully
thus
far
was
left
on
the
trail
a
fog
so
dense
that
we
could
not
see
a
hundred
yards
covered
the
country
and
the
men
that
were
sent
out
after
the
horses
were
bewildered
and
lost
and
we
were
consequently
detained
at
camp
until
late
in
the
day
our
situation
had
now
become
a
serious
one
we
had
reached
and
run
over
the
position
where
according
to
the
best
maps
in
my
possession
we
should
have
found
mary
lake
or
river
we
were
evidently
on
the
verge
of
the
desert
which
had
been
reported
to
us
and
the
appearance
of
the
country
was
so
forbidding
that
i
was
afraid
to
enter
it
and
determined
to
bear
away
to
the
southward
keeping
close
along
the
mountains
in
the
full
expectation
of
reaching
the
buenaventura
river
this
morning
i
put
every
man
in
the
camp
on
foot
myself
of
course
among
the
rest
and
in
this
manner
lightened
by
distribution
the
loads
of
the
animals
we
traveled
seven
or
eight
miles
along
the
ridge
bordering
the
valley
and
encamped
where
there
were
a
few
bunches
of
grass
on
the
bed
of
a
without
water
there
were
some
large
artemisias
but
the
principal
plants
are
chenopodiaceous
shrubs
the
rock
composing
the
mountains
is
here
changed
suddenly
into
white
granite
the
fog
showed
the
tops
of
the
hills
at
sunset
and
stars
enough
for
observations
in
the
early
evening
and
then
closed
over
us
as
before
latitude
by
observation
the
fog
was
still
more
dense
and
the
people
again
were
bewildered
we
traveled
a
few
miles
around
the
western
point
of
the
ridge
and
encamped
where
there
were
a
few
tufts
of
grass
but
no
water
our
animals
now
were
in
a
very
alarming
state
and
there
was
increased
anxiety
in
the
camp
same
dense
fog
continued
and
one
of
the
mules
died
in
camp
this
morning
i
have
had
occasion
to
remark
on
such
occasions
as
these
that
animals
which
are
about
to
die
leave
the
band
and
coming
into
the
camp
lie
down
about
the
fires
we
moved
to
a
place
where
there
was
a
little
better
grass
about
two
miles
distant
taplin
one
of
our
best
men
who
had
gone
out
on
a
scouting
excursion
ascended
a
mountain
near
by
and
to
his
surprise
emerged
into
a
region
of
bright
sunshine
in
which
the
upper
parts
of
the
mountain
were
glowing
while
below
all
was
obscured
in
the
darkest
fog
the
fog
continued
the
same
and
with
preuss
and
carson
i
ascended
the
mountain
to
sketch
the
leading
features
of
the
country
as
some
indication
of
our
future
route
while
fitzpatrick
explored
the
country
below
in
a
very
short
distance
we
had
ascended
above
the
mist
but
the
view
obtained
was
not
very
gratifying
the
fog
had
partially
cleared
off
from
below
when
we
reached
the
summit
and
in
the
southwest
corner
of
a
basin
communicating
with
that
in
which
we
had
encamped
we
saw
a
lofty
column
of
smoke
miles
distant
indicating
the
presence
of
hot
springs
there
also
appeared
to
be
the
outlet
of
those
draining
channels
of
the
country
and
as
such
places
afforded
always
more
or
less
grass
i
determined
to
steer
in
that
direction
the
ridge
we
had
ascended
appeared
to
be
composed
of
fragments
of
white
granite
we
saw
here
traces
of
sheep
and
antelope
entering
the
neighboring
valley
and
crossing
the
bed
of
another
lake
after
a
hard
day
travel
over
ground
of
yielding
mud
and
sand
we
reached
the
springs
where
we
found
an
abundance
of
grass
which
though
only
tolerably
good
made
this
place
with
reference
to
the
past
a
refreshing
and
agreeable
spot
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
locality
of
hot
springs
we
had
met
during
the
journey
the
basin
of
the
largest
one
has
a
circumference
of
several
hundred
feet
but
there
is
at
one
extremity
a
circular
space
of
about
fifteen
feet
in
diameter
entirely
occupied
by
the
boiling
water
it
boils
up
at
irregular
intervals
and
with
much
noise
the
water
is
clear
and
the
spring
deep
a
pole
about
sixteen
feet
long
was
easily
immersed
in
the
centre
but
we
had
no
means
of
forming
a
good
idea
of
the
depth
it
was
surrounded
on
the
margin
with
a
border
of
grass
and
near
the
shore
the
temperature
of
the
water
was
we
had
no
means
of
ascertaining
that
of
the
centre
where
the
heat
was
greatest
but
by
dispersing
the
water
with
a
pole
the
temperature
at
the
margin
was
increased
to
and
in
the
centre
it
was
doubtless
higher
by
driving
the
pole
towards
the
bottom
the
water
was
made
to
boil
up
with
increased
force
and
noise
there
are
several
other
interesting
places
where
water
and
smoke
or
gas
escape
but
they
would
require
a
long
description
the
water
is
impregnated
with
common
salt
but
not
so
much
as
to
render
it
unfit
for
general
cooking
and
a
mixture
of
snow
made
it
pleasant
to
drink
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
the
valley
bottom
is
covered
almost
exclusively
with
chenopodiaceous
shrubs
of
greater
luxuriance
and
larger
growth
than
we
have
seen
them
in
any
preceding
part
of
the
journey
i
obtained
this
evening
some
astronomical
observations
our
situation
now
required
caution
including
those
which
gave
out
from
the
injured
condition
of
their
feet
and
those
stolen
by
indians
we
had
lost
since
leaving
the
dalles
of
the
columbia
fifteen
animals
and
of
these
nine
had
been
left
in
the
last
few
days
i
therefore
determined
until
we
should
reach
a
country
of
water
and
vegetation
to
feel
our
way
ahead
by
having
the
line
of
route
explored
some
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
in
advance
and
only
to
leave
a
present
encampment
when
the
succeeding
one
was
known
taking
with
me
godey
and
carson
i
made
a
thorough
exploration
of
the
neighboring
valleys
and
found
in
a
ravine
in
the
bordering
mountains
a
good
encamping
place
where
was
water
in
springs
and
a
sufficient
quantity
of
grass
for
a
night
overshadowing
the
springs
were
some
trees
of
the
sweet
cottonwood
which
after
a
long
interval
of
absence
we
saw
again
with
pleasure
regarding
them
as
harbingers
of
a
better
country
to
us
they
were
eloquent
of
green
prairies
and
buffalo
we
found
here
a
broad
and
trail
on
which
there
were
tracks
of
horses
and
we
appeared
to
have
regained
one
of
the
thoroughfares
which
pass
by
the
of
the
country
on
the
western
mountains
of
the
valley
with
which
this
of
the
boiling
spring
communicates
we
remarked
scattered
cedars
probably
indicating
that
we
were
on
the
borders
of
the
timbered
region
extending
to
the
pacific
we
reached
the
camp
at
sunset
after
a
day
ride
of
about
miles
the
horses
we
rode
were
in
good
order
being
of
some
that
were
kept
for
emergencies
and
rarely
used
preuss
had
ascended
one
of
the
mountains
and
occupied
the
day
in
sketching
the
country
and
fitzpatrick
had
found
a
few
miles
distant
a
hollow
of
excellent
grass
and
pure
water
to
which
the
animals
were
driven
as
i
remained
another
day
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
recruit
their
strength
indians
appear
to
be
everywhere
prowling
about
like
wild
animals
and
there
is
a
fresh
trail
across
the
snow
in
the
valley
near
latitude
of
the
boiling
springs
on
the
we
crossed
over
to
the
cottonwood
camp
among
the
shrubs
on
the
hills
were
a
few
bushes
of
which
afterwards
occurred
frequently
along
the
road
and
as
usual
the
lowlands
were
occupied
with
artemisia
while
the
party
proceeded
to
this
place
carson
and
myself
reconnoitred
the
road
in
advance
and
found
another
good
encampment
for
the
following
day
we
continued
our
reconnoissance
ahead
pursuing
a
south
direction
in
the
basin
along
the
ridge
the
camp
following
slowly
after
on
a
large
trail
there
is
never
any
doubt
of
finding
suitable
places
for
encampments
we
reached
the
end
of
the
basin
where
we
found
in
a
hollow
of
the
mountain
which
enclosed
it
an
abundance
of
good
leaving
a
signal
for
the
party
to
encamp
we
continued
our
way
up
the
hollow
intending
to
see
what
lay
beyond
the
mountain
the
hollow
was
several
miles
long
forming
a
good
pass
the
snow
deepening
to
about
a
foot
as
we
neared
the
summit
beyond
a
defile
between
the
mountains
descended
rapidly
about
two
thousand
feet
and
filling
up
all
the
lower
space
was
a
sheet
of
green
water
some
twenty
miles
broad
it
broke
upon
our
eyes
like
the
ocean
the
neighboring
peaks
rose
high
above
us
and
we
ascended
one
of
them
to
obtain
a
better
view
the
waves
were
curling
in
the
breeze
and
their
color
showed
it
to
be
a
body
of
deep
water
for
a
long
time
we
sat
enjoying
the
view
for
we
had
become
fatigued
with
mountains
and
the
free
expanse
of
moving
waves
was
very
grateful
it
was
set
like
a
gem
in
the
mountains
which
from
our
position
seemed
to
enclose
it
almost
entirely
at
the
western
end
it
communicated
with
the
line
of
basins
we
had
left
a
few
days
since
and
on
the
opposite
side
it
swept
a
ridge
of
snowy
mountains
the
foot
of
the
great
sierra
its
position
at
first
inclined
us
to
believe
it
mary
lake
but
the
rugged
mountains
were
so
entirely
discordant
with
descriptions
of
its
low
rushy
shores
and
open
country
that
we
concluded
it
some
unknown
body
of
water
which
it
afterwards
proved
to
be
on
our
road
down
the
next
day
we
saw
herds
of
mountain
sheep
and
encamped
on
a
little
stream
at
the
mouth
of
the
defile
about
a
mile
from
the
margin
of
the
water
to
which
we
hurried
down
immediately
the
water
is
so
slightly
salt
that
at
first
we
thought
it
fresh
and
would
be
pleasant
to
drink
when
no
other
could
be
had
the
shore
was
rocky
a
handsome
beach
which
reminded
us
of
the
sea
on
some
large
boulders
that
were
scattered
about
the
shore
i
remarked
a
coating
of
calcareous
substance
in
some
places
a
few
inches
and
in
others
a
foot
in
thickness
near
our
camp
the
hills
which
were
of
primitive
rock
were
also
covered
with
this
substance
which
was
in
too
great
quantity
on
the
mountains
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
to
have
been
deposited
by
water
and
has
the
appearance
of
having
been
spread
over
the
rocks
in
mass
footnote
the
label
attached
to
a
specimen
of
this
rock
was
lost
but
i
append
an
analysis
of
that
which
from
memory
i
judge
to
be
the
specimen
carbonate
of
lime
carbonate
of
magnesia
oxide
of
iron
alumina
silica
organic
matter
water
and
loss
where
we
had
halted
appeared
to
be
a
favorite
for
indians
we
followed
again
a
broad
indian
trail
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
to
the
southward
for
a
short
space
we
had
room
enough
in
the
bottom
but
after
traveling
a
short
distance
the
water
swept
the
foot
of
the
precipitous
mountains
the
peaks
of
which
are
about
feet
above
the
lake
the
trail
wound
along
the
base
of
these
precipices
against
which
the
water
dashed
below
by
a
way
nearly
impracticable
for
the
howitzer
during
a
greater
part
of
the
morning
the
lake
was
nearly
hid
by
a
and
the
waves
broke
on
the
narrow
beach
in
a
long
line
of
foaming
serf
five
or
six
feet
high
the
day
was
unpleasantly
cold
the
wind
driving
the
snow
sharp
against
our
faces
and
having
advanced
only
about
miles
we
encamped
in
a
bottom
formed
by
a
ravine
covered
with
good
grass
which
was
fresh
and
green
we
did
not
get
the
howitzer
into
camp
but
were
obliged
to
leave
it
on
the
rocks
until
morning
we
saw
several
flocks
of
sheep
but
did
not
succeed
in
killing
any
ducks
were
riding
on
the
waves
and
several
large
fish
were
seen
the
mountain
sides
were
crusted
with
the
calcareous
cement
previously
mentioned
there
were
chenopodiaceous
and
other
shrubs
along
the
beach
and
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
an
abundance
of
whose
color
makes
them
evergreens
among
the
shrubby
growth
of
the
lake
towards
evening
the
snow
began
to
fall
heavily
and
the
country
had
a
wintry
appearance
the
next
morning
the
snow
was
rapidly
melting
under
a
warm
sun
part
of
the
morning
was
occupied
in
bringing
up
the
gun
and
making
only
nine
miles
we
encamped
on
the
shore
opposite
a
very
remarkable
rock
in
the
lake
which
had
attracted
our
attention
for
many
miles
it
rose
according
to
our
estimate
feet
above
the
water
and
from
the
point
we
viewed
it
presented
a
pretty
exact
outline
of
the
great
pyramid
of
cheops
like
other
rocks
along
the
shore
it
seemed
to
be
incrusted
with
calcareous
cement
this
striking
feature
suggested
a
name
for
the
lake
and
i
called
it
pyramid
lake
and
though
it
may
be
deemed
by
some
a
fanciful
resemblance
i
can
undertake
to
say
that
the
future
traveler
will
find
much
more
striking
resemblance
between
this
rock
and
the
pyramids
of
egypt
than
there
is
between
them
and
the
object
from
which
they
take
their
name
the
elevation
of
this
lake
above
the
sea
is
feet
being
nearly
feet
higher
than
the
great
salt
lake
from
which
it
lies
nearly
west
and
distant
about
eight
degrees
of
longitude
the
position
and
elevation
of
this
lake
make
it
an
object
of
geographical
interest
it
is
the
nearest
lake
to
the
western
rim
as
the
great
salt
lake
is
to
the
eastern
rim
of
the
great
basin
which
lies
between
the
base
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
sierra
nevada
and
the
extent
and
character
of
which
its
whole
circumference
and
contents
it
is
so
desirable
to
know
the
last
of
the
cattle
which
had
been
driven
from
the
dalles
was
killed
here
for
food
and
was
still
in
good
condition
a
few
indians
made
their
appearance
this
morning
and
we
succeeded
in
getting
one
into
the
camp
he
was
naked
with
the
exception
of
a
tunic
of
he
told
us
that
there
was
a
river
at
the
end
of
the
lake
but
that
he
lived
in
the
rocks
near
by
from
the
few
words
our
people
could
understand
he
spoke
a
dialect
of
the
snake
language
but
we
were
not
able
to
understand
enough
to
know
whether
the
river
ran
in
or
out
or
what
was
its
course
consequently
there
still
remained
a
chance
that
this
might
be
mary
lake
groves
of
large
cottonwood
which
we
could
see
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
indicated
that
it
was
a
stream
of
considerable
size
and
at
all
events
we
had
the
pleasure
to
know
that
now
we
were
in
a
country
where
human
beings
could
live
accompanied
by
the
indian
we
resumed
our
road
passing
on
the
way
several
caves
in
the
rock
where
there
were
baskets
and
reeds
but
the
people
had
disappeared
we
saw
also
along
the
shore
early
in
the
afternoon
when
we
were
approaching
the
groves
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
three
or
four
indians
met
us
on
the
trail
we
had
an
explanatory
conversation
in
signs
and
then
we
moved
on
together
towards
the
village
which
the
chief
said
was
encamped
on
the
bottom
reaching
the
groves
we
found
the
of
a
large
freshwater
stream
and
all
at
once
were
satisfied
that
it
was
neither
mary
river
nor
the
waters
of
the
sacramento
but
that
we
had
discovered
a
large
interior
lake
which
the
indians
informed
us
had
no
outlet
it
is
about
miles
long
and
by
the
mark
of
the
along
the
shore
the
spring
level
is
about
feet
above
its
present
waters
the
chief
commenced
speaking
in
a
loud
voice
as
we
approached
and
parties
of
indians
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
issued
from
the
thickets
we
selected
a
strong
place
for
our
encampment
a
grassy
bottom
nearly
enclosed
by
the
river
and
furnished
with
abundant
firewood
the
village
a
collection
of
straw
huts
was
a
few
hundred
yards
higher
up
an
indian
brought
in
a
large
fish
to
trade
which
we
had
the
inexpressible
satisfaction
to
find
was
a
we
gathered
round
him
eagerly
the
indians
were
amused
with
our
delight
and
immediately
brought
in
numbers
so
that
the
camp
was
soon
stocked
their
flavor
was
excellent
superior
in
fact
to
that
of
any
fish
i
have
ever
known
they
were
of
extraordinary
size
about
as
large
as
the
columbia
river
salmon
generally
from
two
to
four
feet
in
length
from
the
information
of
walker
who
passed
among
some
lakes
lying
more
to
the
eastward
this
fish
is
common
to
the
streams
of
the
inland
lakes
he
subsequently
informed
me
that
he
had
obtained
them
weighing
six
pounds
when
cleaned
and
the
head
taken
off
which
corresponds
very
well
with
the
size
of
those
obtained
at
this
place
they
doubtless
formed
the
subsistence
of
these
people
who
hold
the
fishery
in
exclusive
possession
i
remarked
that
one
of
them
gave
a
fish
to
the
indian
we
had
first
seen
which
he
carried
off
to
his
family
to
them
it
was
probably
a
feast
being
of
the
digger
tribe
and
having
no
share
in
the
fishery
living
generally
on
seeds
and
roots
although
this
was
a
time
of
the
year
when
the
fish
have
not
yet
become
fat
they
were
excellent
and
we
could
only
imagine
what
they
are
at
the
proper
season
these
indians
were
very
fat
and
appeared
to
live
an
easy
and
happy
life
they
crowded
into
the
camp
more
than
was
consistent
with
our
safety
retaining
always
their
arms
and
as
they
made
some
unsatisfactory
demonstrations
they
were
given
to
understand
that
they
would
not
be
permitted
to
come
armed
into
the
camp
and
strong
guards
were
kept
with
the
horses
strict
vigilance
was
maintained
among
the
people
and
at
a
time
were
kept
on
guard
during
the
night
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
these
dispositions
uniformly
preserved
conducted
our
party
securely
through
indians
famed
for
treachery
in
the
mean
time
such
a
feast
as
is
seldom
seen
was
going
on
in
our
camp
and
every
variety
of
manner
in
which
fish
could
be
prepared
boiled
fried
and
roasted
in
the
ashes
was
put
into
requisition
and
every
few
minutes
an
indian
would
be
seen
running
off
to
spear
a
fresh
one
whether
these
indians
had
seen
whites
before
we
could
not
be
certain
but
they
were
evidently
in
communication
with
others
who
had
as
one
of
them
had
some
brass
buttons
and
we
noticed
several
other
articles
of
civilized
manufacture
we
could
obtain
from
them
but
little
information
respecting
the
country
they
made
on
the
ground
a
drawing
of
the
river
which
they
represented
as
issuing
from
another
lake
in
the
mountains
three
or
four
days
distant
in
a
direction
a
little
west
of
south
beyond
which
they
drew
a
mountain
and
further
still
two
rivers
on
one
of
which
they
told
us
that
people
like
ourselves
traveled
whether
they
alluded
to
the
settlements
on
the
sacramento
or
to
a
party
from
the
united
states
which
had
crossed
the
sierra
about
three
degrees
to
the
southward
a
few
years
since
i
am
unable
to
determine
i
tried
unsuccessfully
to
prevail
on
some
of
them
to
guide
us
for
a
few
days
on
the
road
but
they
only
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
the
latitude
of
our
encampment
which
may
be
considered
the
mouth
of
the
inlet
is
by
our
observations
this
morning
we
continued
our
journey
along
this
beautiful
stream
which
we
naturally
called
the
salmon
trout
river
large
trails
led
up
on
either
side
the
stream
was
handsomely
timbered
with
large
cottonwoods
and
the
waters
were
very
clear
and
pure
we
were
traveling
along
the
mountains
of
the
great
sierra
which
rose
on
our
right
covered
with
snow
but
below
the
temperature
was
mild
and
pleasant
we
saw
a
number
of
dams
which
the
indians
had
constructed
to
catch
fish
after
having
made
about
miles
we
encamped
under
some
large
cottonwoods
on
the
river
bottom
where
there
was
tolerably
good
grass
this
morning
we
left
the
river
which
here
issues
from
mountains
on
the
west
with
every
stream
i
now
expected
to
see
the
great
buenaventura
and
carson
hurried
eagerly
to
search
on
every
one
we
reached
for
beaver
cuttings
which
he
always
maintained
we
should
find
only
on
waters
that
ran
to
the
pacific
and
the
absence
of
such
signs
was
to
him
a
sure
indication
that
the
water
had
no
outlet
from
the
great
basin
we
followed
the
indian
trail
through
a
tolerably
level
country
with
small
which
brought
us
after
journey
to
another
large
stream
timbered
with
cottonwood
and
flowing
also
out
of
the
mountains
but
running
more
directly
to
the
eastward
on
the
way
we
surprised
a
family
of
indians
in
the
hills
but
the
man
ran
up
the
mountain
with
rapidity
and
the
woman
was
so
terrified
and
kept
up
such
a
continued
screaming
that
we
could
do
nothing
with
her
and
were
obliged
to
let
her
go
there
were
indian
lodges
and
on
the
stream
there
were
no
beaver
cuttings
on
the
river
but
below
it
turned
round
to
the
right
and
hoping
that
it
would
prove
a
branch
of
the
buenaventura
we
followed
it
down
for
about
three
hours
and
encamped
i
rode
out
with
fitzpatrick
and
carson
to
reconnoitre
the
country
which
had
evidently
been
alarmed
by
the
news
of
our
appearance
this
stream
joined
with
the
open
valley
of
another
to
the
eastward
but
which
way
the
main
water
ran
it
was
impossible
to
tell
columns
of
smoke
rose
over
the
country
at
scattered
intervals
signals
by
which
the
indians
here
as
elsewhere
communicate
to
each
other
that
enemies
are
in
the
country
it
is
a
signal
of
ancient
and
very
universal
application
among
barbarians
examining
into
the
condition
of
the
animals
when
i
returned
into
the
camp
i
found
their
feet
so
much
cut
up
by
the
rocks
and
so
many
of
them
lame
that
it
was
evidently
impossible
that
they
could
cross
the
country
to
the
rocky
mountains
every
piece
of
iron
that
could
be
used
for
the
purpose
had
been
converted
into
nails
and
we
could
make
no
further
use
of
the
shoes
we
had
remaining
i
therefore
determined
to
abandon
my
eastern
course
and
to
cross
the
sierra
nevada
into
the
valley
of
the
sacramento
wherever
a
practicable
pass
could
be
found
my
decision
was
heard
with
joy
by
the
people
and
diffused
new
life
throughout
the
camp
latitude
by
observation
a
great
number
of
smokes
are
still
visible
this
morning
attesting
at
once
the
alarm
our
appearance
had
spread
among
these
people
and
their
ignorance
of
us
if
they
knew
the
whites
they
would
understand
that
their
only
object
in
coming
among
them
was
to
trade
which
required
peace
and
friendship
but
they
have
nothing
to
trade
consequently
nothing
to
attract
the
white
man
hence
their
fear
and
flight
at
daybreak
we
had
a
heavy
snow
but
set
out
and
returning
up
the
stream
went
out
of
our
way
in
a
circuit
over
a
little
mountain
and
encamped
on
the
same
stream
a
few
miles
above
in
latitude
by
observation
we
continued
up
the
stream
and
encamped
on
it
close
to
the
mountains
the
freshly
fallen
snow
was
covered
with
the
tracks
of
indians
who
had
descended
from
upper
waters
probably
called
down
by
the
smokes
in
the
plain
we
ascended
a
peak
of
the
range
which
commanded
a
view
of
this
stream
behind
the
first
ridge
where
it
was
winding
its
course
through
a
somewhat
open
valley
and
i
sometimes
regret
that
i
did
not
make
the
trial
to
cross
here
but
while
we
had
fair
weather
below
the
mountains
were
darkened
with
falling
snow
and
feeling
unwilling
to
encounter
them
we
turned
away
again
to
the
southward
in
that
direction
we
traveled
the
next
day
over
a
tolerably
level
country
having
always
the
high
mountains
on
the
west
there
was
but
little
snow
or
rock
on
the
ground
and
after
having
traveled
miles
we
encamped
again
on
another
large
stream
running
off
to
the
northward
and
eastward
to
meet
that
we
had
left
it
ran
through
broad
bottoms
having
a
fine
appearance
latitude
we
traveled
up
the
stream
about
fourteen
miles
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
from
which
one
branch
issued
in
the
southwest
the
other
flowing
along
their
base
leaving
camp
below
we
ascended
the
range
through
which
the
first
stream
passed
in
a
canon
on
the
western
side
was
a
circular
valley
about
miles
long
through
which
the
stream
wound
its
way
issuing
from
a
gorge
in
the
main
mountain
which
rose
abruptly
beyond
the
valley
looked
yellow
with
faded
grass
and
the
trail
we
had
followed
was
visible
making
towards
the
gorge
and
this
was
evidently
a
pass
but
again
while
all
was
bright
sunshine
on
the
ridge
and
on
the
valley
where
we
were
the
snow
was
falling
heavily
in
the
mountains
i
determined
go
still
to
the
southward
and
encamped
on
the
stream
near
the
forks
the
animals
being
fatigued
and
the
grass
tolerably
good
the
rock
of
the
ridge
we
had
ascended
is
a
compact
lava
assuming
a
granitic
appearance
and
structure
and
containing
in
some
places
small
nodules
of
obsidian
so
far
as
composition
and
aspect
are
concerned
the
rock
in
other
parts
of
the
ridge
appears
to
be
granite
but
it
is
probable
that
this
is
only
a
compact
form
of
lava
of
recent
origin
by
observation
the
elevation
of
the
encampment
was
feet
and
the
latitude
we
moved
along
the
course
of
the
other
branch
towards
the
southeast
the
country
affording
a
fine
road
and
passing
some
slight
descended
towards
the
valley
of
another
stream
there
was
a
somewhat
mountain
ahead
which
it
appeared
to
issue
from
or
to
enter
we
could
not
tell
which
and
as
the
course
of
the
valley
and
the
inclination
of
the
ground
had
a
favorable
direction
we
were
sanguine
to
find
here
a
branch
of
the
buenaventura
but
were
again
disappointed
finding
it
an
inland
water
on
which
we
encamped
after
a
day
journey
of
miles
it
was
evident
that
from
the
time
we
descended
into
the
plain
at
summer
lake
we
had
been
flanking
the
great
range
of
mountains
which
divided
the
great
basin
from
the
waters
of
the
pacific
and
that
the
continued
succession
and
almost
connection
of
lakes
and
rivers
which
we
encountered
were
the
drainings
of
that
range
its
rains
springs
and
snows
would
sufficiently
account
for
these
lakes
and
streams
numerous
as
they
were
a
man
was
discovered
running
towards
the
camp
as
we
were
about
to
start
this
morning
who
proved
to
be
an
indian
of
rather
advanced
age
a
sort
of
forlorn
hope
who
seemed
to
have
been
worked
up
into
the
resolution
of
visiting
the
strangers
who
were
passing
through
the
country
he
seized
the
hand
of
the
first
man
he
met
as
he
came
up
out
of
breath
and
held
on
as
if
to
assure
himself
of
protection
he
brought
with
him
in
a
little
skin
bag
a
few
pounds
of
the
seeds
of
a
which
we
saw
for
the
first
time
and
which
torrey
has
described
as
a
new
species
under
the
name
of
in
popular
language
it
might
be
called
the
we
purchased
them
all
from
him
the
nut
is
oily
of
very
agreeable
flavor
and
must
be
very
nutritious
as
it
constitutes
the
principal
subsistence
of
the
tribes
among
which
we
were
now
traveling
by
a
present
of
scarlet
cloth
and
other
striking
articles
we
prevailed
upon
this
man
to
be
our
guide
of
two
days
journey
as
clearly
as
possible
by
signs
we
made
him
understand
our
object
and
he
engaged
to
conduct
us
in
sight
of
a
good
pass
which
he
knew
here
we
ceased
to
hear
the
shoshonee
language
that
of
this
man
being
perfectly
unintelligible
several
indians
who
had
been
waiting
to
see
what
reception
he
would
meet
with
now
came
into
camp
and
accompanied
by
the
we
resumed
our
journey
the
road
led
us
up
the
creek
which
here
becomes
a
rather
rapid
mountain
stream
fifty
feet
wide
between
hills
without
snow
but
immediately
beyond
them
rose
snowy
mountains
on
either
side
timbered
principally
with
the
nut
pine
on
the
lower
grounds
the
general
height
of
this
tree
is
twelve
to
twenty
feet
and
eight
inches
the
greatest
diameter
it
is
rather
branching
and
has
a
peculiar
and
singular
but
pleasant
odor
we
followed
the
river
for
only
a
short
distance
along
a
rocky
trail
and
crossed
it
at
a
dam
which
the
indians
made
us
comprehend
had
been
built
to
catch
salmon
trout
the
snow
and
ice
were
heaped
up
against
it
three
or
four
feet
deep
entirely
across
the
stream
leaving
here
the
stream
which
runs
through
impassable
canons
we
continued
our
road
over
a
very
broken
country
passing
through
a
low
gap
between
the
snowy
mountains
the
rock
which
occurs
immediately
in
the
pass
has
the
appearance
of
impure
sandstone
containing
scales
of
black
mica
this
may
be
only
a
stratified
lava
on
issuing
from
the
gap
the
compact
lava
and
other
volcanic
products
usual
in
the
country
again
occurred
we
descended
from
the
gap
into
a
wide
valley
or
rather
basin
and
encamped
on
a
small
tributary
to
the
last
stream
on
which
there
was
very
good
grass
it
was
covered
with
such
thick
ice
that
it
required
some
labor
with
pickaxes
to
make
holes
for
the
animals
to
drink
the
banks
are
lightly
wooded
with
willow
and
on
the
upper
bottoms
are
sage
and
fremontia
with
which
begins
to
occur
more
frequently
the
day
has
been
a
summer
one
warm
and
pleasant
no
snow
on
the
trail
which
as
we
are
all
on
foot
makes
traveling
more
agreeable
the
hunters
went
into
a
neighboring
mountain
but
found
no
game
we
have
five
indians
in
camp
the
morning
was
cold
and
bright
and
as
the
sun
rose
the
day
became
beautiful
a
party
of
twelve
indians
came
down
from
the
mountains
to
trade
pine
nuts
of
which
each
one
carried
a
little
bag
these
seemed
now
to
be
the
staple
of
the
country
and
whenever
we
met
an
indian
his
friendly
salutation
consisted
in
offering
a
few
nuts
to
eat
and
to
trade
their
only
arms
were
bows
and
arrows
it
appeared
that
in
almost
all
the
valleys
the
neighboring
bands
were
at
war
with
each
other
and
we
had
some
difficulty
in
prevailing
on
our
guides
to
accompany
us
on
this
day
journey
being
at
war
with
the
people
on
the
other
side
of
a
large
snowy
mountain
which
lay
before
us
the
general
level
of
the
country
appeared
to
be
getting
higher
and
we
were
gradually
entering
the
heart
of
the
mountains
accompanied
by
all
the
indians
we
ascended
a
long
ridge
and
reached
a
pure
spring
at
the
edge
of
the
timber
where
the
indians
had
waylaid
and
killed
an
antelope
and
where
the
greater
part
of
them
left
us
our
pacific
conduct
had
quieted
their
alarms
and
though
at
war
among
each
other
yet
all
confided
in
us
thanks
to
the
combined
effects
of
power
and
kindness
for
our
arms
inspired
respect
and
our
little
presents
and
good
treatment
conciliated
their
confidence
here
we
suddenly
entered
snow
six
inches
deep
and
the
ground
was
a
little
rocky
with
volcanic
fragments
the
mountain
appearing
to
be
composed
of
such
rock
the
timber
consists
principally
of
nut
pines
which
here
are
of
larger
size
to
inches
in
diameter
heaps
of
cones
lying
on
the
ground
where
the
indians
have
gathered
the
seeds
the
snow
deepened
gradually
as
we
advanced
our
guides
wore
out
their
moccasins
and
putting
one
of
them
on
a
horse
we
enjoyed
the
unusual
sight
of
an
indian
who
could
not
ride
he
could
not
even
guide
the
animal
and
appeared
to
have
no
knowledge
of
horses
the
snow
was
three
or
four
feet
deep
on
the
summit
of
the
pass
and
from
this
point
the
guide
pointed
out
our
future
road
declining
to
go
any
further
below
us
was
a
little
valley
and
beyond
this
the
mountains
rose
higher
still
one
ridge
above
another
presenting
a
rude
and
rocky
outline
we
descended
rapidly
to
the
valley
the
snow
impeded
us
but
little
yet
it
was
dark
when
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
day
had
been
so
warm
that
our
moccasins
were
wet
with
melting
snow
but
here
as
soon
as
the
sun
begins
to
decline
the
air
gets
suddenly
cold
and
we
had
great
difficulty
to
keep
our
feet
from
freezing
our
moccasins
being
frozen
perfectly
stiff
after
a
hard
day
march
of
miles
we
reached
the
river
some
time
after
dark
and
found
the
snow
about
a
foot
deep
on
the
bottom
the
river
being
entirely
frozen
over
we
found
a
comfortable
camp
where
there
were
dry
willows
abundant
and
we
soon
had
blazing
fires
a
little
brandy
which
i
husbanded
with
great
care
remained
and
i
do
not
know
any
medicine
more
salutary
or
any
drink
except
coffee
more
agreeable
than
this
in
a
cold
night
and
after
a
hard
day
march
preuss
questioned
whether
the
famed
nectar
ever
possessed
so
exquisite
a
flavor
all
felt
it
to
be
a
reviving
cordial
the
next
morning
when
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
over
the
mountains
the
thermometer
was
at
below
zero
but
the
sky
was
bright
and
pure
and
the
weather
changed
rapidly
into
a
pleasant
day
of
summer
i
remained
encamped
in
order
to
examine
the
country
and
allow
the
animals
a
day
of
rest
the
grass
being
good
and
abundant
under
the
snow
the
river
is
fifty
or
eighty
feet
wide
with
a
lively
current
and
very
clear
water
it
forked
a
little
above
our
camp
one
of
its
branches
coming
directly
from
the
south
at
its
head
appeared
to
be
a
handsome
pass
and
from
the
neighboring
heights
we
could
see
beyond
a
comparatively
low
and
open
country
which
was
supposed
to
form
the
valley
of
the
buenaventura
the
other
branch
issued
from
a
nearer
pass
in
a
direction
forking
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
receiving
a
part
of
its
waters
from
a
little
lake
i
was
in
advance
of
the
camp
when
our
last
guides
had
left
us
but
so
far
as
could
be
understood
this
was
the
pass
which
they
had
indicated
and
in
company
with
carson
i
set
out
to
explore
it
entering
the
range
we
continued
in
a
northwesterly
direction
up
the
valley
which
here
bent
to
the
right
it
was
a
pretty
open
bottom
locked
between
lofty
mountains
which
supplied
frequent
streams
as
we
advanced
on
the
lower
part
they
were
covered
with
trees
and
above
with
masses
of
pine
which
we
easily
recognised
from
the
darker
color
of
the
foliage
from
the
fresh
trails
which
occurred
frequently
during
the
morning
deer
appeared
to
be
remarkably
numerous
in
the
mountain
we
had
now
entirely
left
the
desert
country
and
were
on
the
verge
of
a
region
which
extending
westward
to
the
shores
of
the
pacific
abounds
in
large
game
and
is
covered
with
a
singular
luxuriance
of
vegetable
life
the
little
stream
grew
rapidly
smaller
and
in
about
twelve
miles
we
had
reached
its
head
the
last
water
coming
immediately
out
of
the
mountain
on
the
right
and
this
spot
was
selected
for
our
next
encampment
the
grass
showed
well
in
sunny
places
but
in
colder
situations
the
snow
was
deep
and
began
to
occur
in
banks
through
which
the
horses
found
some
difficulty
in
breaking
a
way
to
the
left
the
open
valley
continued
in
a
southwesterly
direction
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
ascent
forming
a
beautiful
pass
the
exploration
of
which
we
deferred
until
the
next
day
and
returned
to
the
camp
an
indian
passed
through
the
valley
on
his
way
into
the
mountains
where
he
showed
us
was
his
lodge
we
comprehended
nothing
of
his
language
and
though
he
appeared
to
have
no
fear
passing
along
in
full
view
of
the
camp
he
was
indisposed
to
hold
any
communication
with
us
but
showed
the
way
he
was
going
and
pointed
for
us
to
go
on
our
road
by
observation
the
latitude
of
this
encampment
was
and
the
elevation
above
the
sea
feet
leaving
the
camp
to
follow
slowly
with
directions
to
carson
to
encamp
at
the
place
agreed
on
fitzpatrick
and
myself
continued
the
reconnoissance
arriving
at
the
head
of
the
stream
we
began
to
enter
the
pass
passing
occasionally
through
open
groves
of
large
on
the
warm
side
of
the
defile
where
the
snow
had
melted
away
occasionally
exposing
a
large
indian
trail
continuing
along
a
narrow
meadow
we
reached
in
a
few
miles
the
gate
of
the
pass
where
there
was
a
narrow
strip
of
prairie
about
yards
wide
between
walls
of
granite
rock
on
either
side
rose
the
mountains
forming
on
the
left
a
rugged
mass
or
nucleus
wholly
covered
with
deep
snow
presenting
a
glittering
and
icy
surface
at
the
time
we
supposed
this
to
be
the
point
into
which
they
were
gathered
between
the
two
great
rivers
and
from
which
the
waters
flowed
off
to
the
bay
this
was
the
icy
and
cold
side
of
the
pass
and
the
rays
of
the
sun
hardly
touched
the
snow
on
the
left
the
mountains
rose
into
peaks
but
they
were
lower
and
secondary
and
the
country
had
a
somewhat
more
open
and
lighter
character
on
the
right
were
several
hot
springs
which
appeared
remarkable
in
such
a
place
in
going
through
we
felt
impressed
by
the
majesty
of
the
mountain
along
the
huge
wall
of
which
we
were
riding
here
there
was
no
snow
but
immediately
beyond
was
a
deep
bank
through
which
we
dragged
our
horses
with
considerable
effort
we
then
immediately
struck
upon
a
stream
which
gathered
itself
rapidly
and
descended
quick
and
the
valley
did
not
preserve
the
open
character
of
the
other
side
appearing
below
to
form
a
canon
we
therefore
climbed
one
of
the
peaks
on
the
right
leaving
our
horses
below
but
we
were
so
much
shut
up
that
we
did
not
obtain
an
extensive
view
and
what
we
saw
was
not
very
satisfactory
and
awakened
considerable
doubt
the
valley
of
the
stream
pursued
a
northwesterly
direction
appearing
below
to
turn
sharply
to
the
right
beyond
which
further
view
was
cut
off
it
was
nevertheless
resolved
to
continue
our
road
the
next
day
down
this
valley
which
we
trusted
still
would
prove
that
of
the
middle
stream
between
the
two
great
rivers
towards
the
summit
of
this
peak
the
fields
of
snow
were
four
or
five
feet
deep
on
the
northern
side
and
we
saw
several
large
hares
which
had
on
their
winter
color
being
white
as
the
snow
around
them
the
winter
day
is
short
in
the
mountains
the
sun
having
but
a
small
space
of
sky
to
travel
over
in
the
visible
part
above
our
horizon
and
the
moment
his
rays
are
gone
the
air
is
keenly
cold
the
interest
of
our
work
had
detained
us
long
and
it
was
after
nightfall
when
we
reached
the
camp
we
went
through
the
pass
with
all
the
camp
and
after
a
hard
day
journey
of
twelve
miles
encamped
on
a
high
point
where
the
snow
had
been
blown
off
and
the
exposed
grass
afforded
a
scanty
pasture
for
the
animals
snow
and
broken
country
together
made
our
traveling
difficult
we
were
often
compelled
to
make
large
circuits
and
ascend
the
highest
and
most
exposed
ridges
in
order
to
avoid
snow
which
in
other
places
was
banked
up
to
a
great
depth
during
the
day
a
few
indians
were
seen
circling
around
us
on
and
skimming
along
like
birds
but
we
could
not
bring
them
within
speaking
distance
godey
who
was
a
little
distance
from
the
camp
had
sat
down
to
tie
his
moccasins
when
he
heard
a
low
whistle
near
and
looking
up
saw
two
indians
half
hiding
behind
a
rock
about
forty
yards
distant
they
would
not
allow
him
to
approach
but
breaking
into
a
laugh
skimmed
off
over
the
snow
seeming
to
have
no
idea
of
the
power
of
firearms
and
thinking
themselves
perfectly
safe
when
beyond
arm
length
we
did
not
succeed
in
getting
the
howitzer
into
camp
this
was
the
most
laborious
day
we
had
yet
passed
through
the
steep
ascents
and
deep
snow
exhausting
both
men
and
animals
our
single
chronometer
had
stopped
during
the
day
and
its
error
in
time
occasioned
the
loss
of
an
eclipse
of
a
satellite
this
evening
it
had
not
preserved
the
rate
with
which
we
started
from
the
dalles
and
this
will
account
for
the
absence
of
longitudes
along
this
interval
of
our
journey
from
this
height
we
could
see
at
a
considerable
distance
below
yellow
spots
in
the
valley
which
indicated
that
there
was
not
much
snow
one
of
these
places
we
expected
to
reach
and
some
time
being
required
to
bring
up
the
gun
i
went
ahead
with
fitzpatrick
and
a
few
men
leaving
the
camp
to
follow
in
charge
of
preuss
we
followed
a
trail
down
a
hollow
where
the
indians
had
descended
the
snow
being
so
deep
that
we
never
came
near
the
ground
but
this
only
made
our
descent
the
easier
and
when
we
reached
a
little
affluent
to
the
river
at
the
bottom
we
suddenly
found
ourselves
in
presence
of
eight
or
ten
indians
they
seemed
to
be
watching
our
motions
and
like
the
others
at
first
were
indisposed
to
let
us
approach
ranging
themselves
like
birds
on
a
fallen
log
on
the
above
our
heads
where
being
out
of
our
reach
they
thought
themselves
safe
our
friendly
demeanor
reconciled
them
and
when
we
got
near
enough
they
immediately
stretched
out
to
us
handfuls
of
which
seemed
an
exercise
of
hospitality
we
made
them
a
few
presents
and
telling
us
that
their
village
was
a
few
miles
below
they
went
on
to
let
their
people
know
what
we
were
the
principal
stream
still
running
through
an
impracticable
canon
we
ascended
a
very
steep
hill
which
proved
afterwards
the
last
and
fatal
obstacle
to
our
little
howitzer
which
was
finally
abandoned
at
this
place
we
passed
through
a
small
meadow
a
few
miles
below
crossing
the
river
which
depth
swift
current
and
rock
made
it
difficult
to
ford
and
after
a
few
more
miles
of
very
difficult
trail
issued
into
a
larger
prairie
bottom
at
the
farther
end
of
which
we
encamped
in
a
position
rendered
strong
by
rocks
and
trees
the
lower
parts
of
the
mountain
were
covered
with
the
several
indians
appeared
on
the
reconnoitring
the
camp
and
were
induced
to
come
in
others
came
in
during
the
afternoon
and
in
the
evening
we
held
a
council
the
indians
immediately
made
it
clear
that
the
waters
on
which
we
were
also
belonged
to
the
great
basin
in
the
edge
of
which
we
had
been
since
the
of
december
and
it
became
evident
that
we
had
still
the
great
ridge
on
the
left
to
cross
before
we
could
reach
the
pacific
waters
we
explained
to
the
indians
that
we
were
endeavoring
to
find
a
passage
across
the
mountains
into
the
country
of
the
whites
whom
we
were
going
to
see
and
told
them
that
we
wished
them
to
bring
us
a
guide
to
whom
we
would
give
presents
of
scarlet
cloth
and
other
articles
which
were
shown
to
them
they
looked
at
the
reward
we
offered
and
conferred
with
each
other
but
pointed
to
the
snow
on
the
mountain
and
drew
their
hands
across
their
necks
and
raised
them
above
their
heads
to
show
the
depth
and
signified
that
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
get
through
they
made
signs
that
we
must
go
to
the
southward
over
a
pass
through
a
lower
range
which
they
pointed
out
there
they
said
at
the
end
of
one
day
travel
we
would
find
people
who
lived
near
a
pass
in
the
great
mountain
and
to
that
point
they
engaged
to
furnish
us
a
guide
they
appeared
to
have
a
confused
idea
from
report
of
whites
who
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
and
once
they
told
us
about
two
years
ago
a
party
of
twelve
men
like
ourselves
had
ascended
their
river
and
crossed
to
the
other
waters
they
pointed
out
to
us
where
they
had
crossed
but
then
they
said
it
was
summer
time
but
now
it
would
be
impossible
i
believe
that
this
was
a
party
led
by
chiles
one
of
the
only
two
men
whom
i
know
to
have
passed
through
the
california
mountains
from
the
interior
of
the
basin
walker
being
the
other
and
both
were
engaged
upwards
of
twenty
days
in
the
summer
time
in
getting
over
chiles
destination
was
the
bay
of
san
francisco
to
which
he
descended
by
the
stanislaus
river
and
walker
subsequently
informed
me
that
like
myself
descending
to
the
southward
on
a
more
eastern
line
day
after
day
he
was
searching
for
the
buenaventura
thinking
that
he
had
found
it
with
every
new
stream
until
like
me
he
abandoned
all
idea
of
its
existence
and
turning
abruptly
to
the
right
crossed
the
great
chain
these
were
both
western
men
animated
with
the
spirit
of
exploratory
enterprise
which
characterizes
that
people
the
indians
brought
in
during
the
evening
an
abundant
supply
of
which
we
traded
from
them
when
roasted
their
pleasant
flavor
made
them
an
agreeable
addition
to
our
now
scanty
store
of
provisions
which
were
reduced
to
a
very
low
ebb
our
principal
stock
was
in
peas
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
contain
scarcely
any
nutriment
we
had
still
a
little
flour
left
some
coffee
and
a
quantity
of
sugar
which
i
reserved
as
a
defence
against
starvation
the
indians
informed
us
that
at
certain
seasons
they
have
fish
in
their
waters
which
we
supposed
to
be
for
the
remainder
of
the
year
they
live
upon
the
which
form
their
great
winter
subsistence
a
portion
being
always
at
hand
shut
up
in
the
natural
storehouse
of
the
cones
at
present
they
were
presented
to
us
as
a
whole
people
living
upon
this
simple
vegetable
the
other
division
of
the
party
did
not
come
in
but
encamped
in
the
upper
meadow
and
arrived
the
next
morning
they
had
not
succeeded
in
getting
the
howitzer
beyond
the
place
mentioned
and
where
it
had
been
left
by
preuss
in
obedience
to
my
orders
and
in
anticipation
of
the
and
still
ahead
foreseeing
the
inevitable
detention
to
which
it
would
subject
us
i
reluctantly
determined
to
leave
it
there
for
the
time
it
was
of
the
kind
invented
by
the
french
for
the
mountain
part
of
their
war
in
algiers
and
the
distance
it
had
come
with
us
proved
how
well
it
was
adapted
to
its
purpose
we
left
it
to
the
great
sorrow
of
the
whole
party
who
were
grieved
to
part
with
a
companion
which
had
made
the
whole
distance
from
louis
and
commanded
respect
for
us
on
some
critical
occasions
and
which
might
be
needed
for
the
same
purpose
again
our
guide
who
was
a
young
man
joined
us
this
morning
and
leaving
our
encampment
late
in
the
day
we
descended
the
river
which
immediately
opened
out
into
a
broad
valley
furnishing
good
traveling
ground
in
a
short
distance
we
passed
the
village
a
collection
of
straw
huts
and
a
few
miles
below
the
guide
pointed
out
the
place
where
the
whites
had
been
encamped
before
they
entered
the
mountain
with
our
late
start
we
made
but
ten
miles
and
encamped
on
the
low
where
there
was
no
snow
but
a
great
deal
of
ice
and
we
cut
piles
of
long
grass
to
lay
under
our
blankets
and
fires
were
made
of
large
dry
willows
groves
of
which
wooded
the
stream
the
river
took
here
a
northeasterly
direction
and
through
a
spur
from
the
mountains
on
the
left
was
the
gap
where
we
were
to
pass
the
next
day
we
took
our
way
over
a
gently
rising
ground
the
dividing
ridge
being
tolerably
low
and
traveling
easily
along
a
broad
trail
in
twelve
or
fourteen
miles
reached
the
upper
part
of
the
pass
when
it
began
to
snow
thickly
with
very
cold
weather
the
indians
had
only
the
usual
scanty
covering
and
appeared
to
suffer
greatly
from
the
cold
all
left
us
except
our
guide
half
hidden
by
the
storm
the
mountains
looked
dreary
and
as
night
began
to
approach
the
guide
showed
great
reluctance
to
go
forward
i
placed
him
between
two
rifles
for
the
way
began
to
be
difficult
traveling
a
little
farther
we
struck
a
ravine
which
the
indian
said
would
conduct
us
to
the
river
and
as
the
poor
fellow
suffered
greatly
shivering
in
the
snow
which
fell
upon
his
naked
skin
i
would
not
detain
him
any
longer
and
he
ran
off
to
the
mountain
where
he
said
was
a
hut
near
by
he
had
kept
the
blue
and
scarlet
cloth
i
had
given
him
tightly
rolled
up
preferring
rather
to
endure
the
cold
than
to
get
them
wet
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
one
of
the
men
had
his
foot
frostbitten
and
about
dark
we
had
the
satisfaction
to
reach
the
bottoms
of
a
stream
timbered
with
large
trees
among
which
we
found
a
sheltered
camp
with
an
abundance
of
such
grass
as
the
season
afforded
for
the
animals
we
saw
before
us
in
descending
from
the
pass
a
great
continuous
range
along
which
stretched
the
valley
of
the
river
the
lower
parts
steep
and
dark
with
pines
while
above
it
was
hidden
in
clouds
of
snow
this
we
felt
instantly
satisfied
was
the
central
ridge
of
the
sierra
nevada
the
great
california
mountain
which
only
now
intervened
between
us
and
the
waters
of
the
bay
we
had
made
a
forced
march
of
miles
and
three
mules
had
given
out
on
the
road
up
to
this
point
with
the
exception
of
two
stolen
by
indians
we
had
lost
none
of
the
horses
which
had
been
brought
from
the
columbia
river
and
a
number
of
these
were
still
strong
and
in
tolerably
good
order
we
had
now
animals
in
the
band
we
had
scarcely
lighted
our
fires
when
the
camp
was
crowded
with
nearly
naked
indians
some
of
them
were
furnished
with
long
nets
in
addition
to
bows
and
appeared
to
have
been
out
on
the
sage
hills
to
hunt
rabbits
these
nets
were
perhaps
to
feet
long
kept
upright
in
the
ground
by
slight
sticks
at
intervals
and
were
made
from
a
kind
of
wild
hemp
very
much
resembling
in
manufacture
those
common
among
the
indians
of
the
sacramento
valley
they
came
among
us
without
any
fear
and
scattered
themselves
about
the
fires
mainly
occupied
in
gratifying
their
astonishment
i
was
struck
by
the
singular
appearance
of
a
row
of
about
a
dozen
who
were
sitting
on
their
haunches
perched
on
a
log
near
one
of
the
fires
with
their
quick
sharp
eyes
following
every
motion
we
gathered
together
a
few
of
the
most
intelligent
of
the
indians
and
held
this
evening
an
interesting
council
i
explained
to
them
my
intentions
i
told
them
that
we
had
come
from
a
very
far
country
having
been
traveling
now
nearly
a
year
and
that
we
were
desirous
simply
to
go
across
the
mountain
into
the
country
of
the
other
whites
there
were
two
who
appeared
particularly
intelligent
one
a
somewhat
old
man
he
told
me
that
before
the
snows
fell
it
was
six
sleeps
to
the
place
where
the
whites
lived
but
that
now
it
was
impossible
to
cross
the
mountain
on
account
of
the
deep
snow
and
showing
us
as
the
others
had
done
that
it
was
over
our
heads
he
urged
us
strongly
to
follow
the
course
of
the
river
which
he
said
would
conduct
us
to
a
lake
in
which
there
were
many
large
fish
there
he
said
were
many
people
there
was
no
snow
on
the
ground
and
we
might
remain
there
until
the
spring
from
their
descriptions
we
were
enabled
to
judge
that
we
had
encamped
on
the
upper
water
of
the
salmon
trout
river
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
our
communication
was
only
by
signs
as
we
understood
nothing
of
their
language
but
they
spoke
notwithstanding
rapidly
and
vehemently
explaining
what
they
considered
the
folly
of
our
intentions
and
urging
us
to
go
down
to
the
lake
a
word
signifying
snow
we
very
soon
learned
to
know
from
its
frequent
repetition
i
told
him
that
the
men
and
the
horses
were
strong
that
we
would
break
a
road
through
the
snow
and
spreading
before
him
our
bales
of
scarlet
cloth
and
trinkets
showed
him
what
we
would
give
for
a
guide
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
one
if
possible
for
i
had
determined
here
to
attempt
the
passage
of
the
mountain
pulling
a
bunch
of
grass
from
the
ground
after
a
short
discussion
among
themselves
the
old
man
made
us
comprehend
that
if
we
could
break
through
the
snow
at
the
end
of
three
days
we
would
come
down
upon
grass
which
he
showed
us
would
be
about
six
inches
high
and
where
the
ground
was
entirely
free
so
far
he
said
he
had
been
in
hunting
for
elk
but
beyond
that
and
he
closed
his
eyes
he
had
seen
nothing
but
there
was
one
among
them
who
had
been
to
the
whites
and
going
out
of
the
lodge
he
returned
with
a
young
man
of
very
intelligent
appearance
here
said
he
is
a
young
man
who
has
seen
the
whites
with
his
own
eyes
and
he
swore
first
by
the
sky
and
then
by
the
ground
that
what
he
said
was
true
with
a
large
present
of
goods
we
prevailed
upon
this
young
man
to
be
our
guide
and
he
acquired
among
us
the
name
of
melo
a
word
signifying
friend
which
they
used
very
frequently
he
was
thinly
clad
and
nearly
barefoot
his
moccasins
being
about
worn
out
we
gave
him
skins
to
make
a
new
pair
and
to
enable
him
to
perform
his
undertaking
to
us
the
indians
remained
in
the
camp
during
the
night
and
we
kept
the
guide
and
two
others
to
sleep
in
the
lodge
with
us
carson
lying
across
the
door
and
having
made
them
comprehend
the
use
of
our
fire
arms
february
the
snow
which
had
intermitted
in
the
evening
commenced
falling
again
in
the
course
of
the
night
and
it
snowed
steadily
all
day
in
the
morning
i
acquainted
the
men
with
my
decision
and
explained
to
them
that
necessity
required
us
to
make
a
great
effort
to
clear
the
mountains
i
reminded
them
of
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
sacramento
with
which
they
were
familiar
from
the
descriptions
of
carson
who
had
been
there
some
fifteen
years
ago
and
who
in
our
late
privations
had
delighted
us
in
speaking
of
its
rich
pastures
and
abounding
game
and
drew
a
vivid
contrast
between
its
summer
climate
less
than
a
hundred
miles
distant
and
the
falling
snow
around
us
i
informed
them
and
long
experience
had
given
them
confidence
in
my
observations
and
good
instruments
that
almost
directly
west
and
only
about
miles
distant
was
the
great
farming
establishment
of
captain
sutter
a
gentleman
who
had
formerly
lived
in
missouri
and
emigrating
to
this
country
had
become
the
possessor
of
a
principality
i
assured
them
that
from
the
heights
of
the
mountain
before
us
we
should
doubtless
see
the
valley
of
the
sacramento
river
and
with
one
effort
place
ourselves
again
in
the
midst
of
plenty
the
people
received
this
decision
with
the
cheerful
obedience
which
had
always
characterized
them
and
the
day
was
immediately
devoted
to
the
preparations
necessary
to
enable
us
to
carry
it
into
effect
leggins
moccasins
clothing
all
were
put
into
the
best
state
to
resist
the
cold
our
guide
was
not
neglected
extremity
of
suffering
might
make
him
desert
we
therefore
did
the
best
we
could
for
him
leggins
moccasins
some
articles
of
clothing
and
a
large
green
blanket
in
addition
to
the
blue
and
scarlet
cloth
were
lavished
upon
him
and
to
his
great
and
evident
contentment
he
arrayed
himself
in
all
his
colors
and
clad
in
green
blue
and
scarlet
he
made
a
indian
and
with
his
various
presents
was
probably
richer
and
better
clothed
than
any
of
his
tribe
had
ever
been
before
i
have
already
said
that
our
provisions
were
very
low
we
had
neither
tallow
nor
grease
of
any
kind
remaining
and
the
want
of
salt
became
one
of
our
greatest
privations
the
poor
dog
which
had
been
found
in
the
bear
river
valley
and
which
had
been
a
de
ever
since
had
now
become
fat
and
the
mess
to
which
it
belonged
requested
permission
to
kill
it
leave
was
granted
spread
out
on
the
snow
the
meat
looked
very
good
and
it
made
a
strengthening
meal
for
the
greater
part
of
the
camp
indians
brought
in
two
or
three
rabbits
during
the
day
which
were
purchased
from
them
the
river
was
to
feet
wide
and
now
entirely
frozen
over
it
was
wooded
with
large
cottonwood
willow
and
de
by
observation
the
latitude
of
this
encampment
was
it
had
ceased
snowing
and
this
morning
the
lower
air
was
clear
and
frosty
and
six
or
seven
thousand
feet
above
the
peaks
of
the
sierra
now
and
then
appeared
among
the
rolling
clouds
which
were
rapidly
dispersing
before
the
sun
our
indian
shook
his
head
as
he
pointed
to
the
icy
pinnacles
shooting
high
up
into
the
sky
and
seeming
almost
immediately
above
us
crossing
the
river
on
the
ice
and
leaving
it
immediately
we
commenced
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
along
the
valley
of
a
tributary
stream
the
people
were
unusually
silent
for
every
man
knew
that
our
enterprise
was
hazardous
and
the
issue
doubtful
the
snow
deepened
rapidly
and
it
soon
became
necessary
to
break
a
road
for
this
service
a
party
of
ten
was
formed
mounted
on
the
strongest
horses
each
man
in
succession
opening
the
road
on
foot
or
on
horseback
until
himself
and
his
horse
became
fatigued
when
he
stepped
aside
and
the
remaining
number
passing
ahead
he
took
his
station
in
the
rear
leaving
this
stream
and
pursuing
a
very
direct
course
we
passed
over
an
intervening
ridge
to
the
river
we
had
left
on
the
way
we
passed
two
low
huts
entirely
covered
with
snow
which
might
very
easily
have
escaped
observation
a
family
was
living
in
each
and
the
only
trail
i
saw
in
the
neighborhood
was
from
the
to
a
tree
near
which
supplied
them
with
food
and
fuel
we
found
two
similar
huts
on
the
creek
where
we
next
arrived
and
traveling
a
little
higher
up
encamped
on
its
banks
in
about
four
feet
depth
of
snow
carson
found
near
an
open
where
the
wind
and
the
sun
had
melted
the
snow
leaving
exposed
sufficient
for
the
animals
the
were
now
giving
way
to
heavy
timber
and
there
were
some
immense
pines
on
the
bottom
around
the
roots
of
which
the
sun
had
melted
away
the
snow
and
here
we
made
our
camp
and
built
huge
fires
we
had
traveled
miles
and
our
elevation
above
the
sea
was
feet
turning
our
faces
directly
towards
the
main
chain
we
ascended
an
open
hollow
along
a
small
tributary
to
the
river
which
according
to
the
indians
issues
from
a
mountain
to
the
south
the
snow
was
so
deep
in
the
hollow
that
we
were
obliged
to
travel
along
the
steep
and
over
spurs
where
the
wind
and
sun
had
in
places
lessened
the
snow
and
where
the
grass
which
appeared
to
be
in
good
quality
along
the
sides
of
the
mountains
was
exposed
we
opened
our
road
in
the
same
way
as
yesterday
but
made
only
seven
miles
and
encamped
by
some
springs
at
the
foot
of
a
high
and
steep
hill
by
which
the
hollow
ascended
to
another
basin
in
the
mountain
the
little
stream
below
was
entirely
buried
in
snow
the
springs
were
shaded
by
the
boughs
of
a
lofty
cedar
which
here
made
its
first
appearance
the
usual
height
was
to
feet
and
one
that
was
measured
near
by
was
six
feet
in
diameter
there
being
no
grass
exposed
here
the
horses
were
sent
back
to
that
which
we
had
seen
a
few
miles
below
we
occupied
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
beating
down
a
road
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
a
mile
or
two
distant
the
snow
being
beaten
down
when
moist
in
the
warm
part
of
the
day
and
then
hard
frozen
at
night
made
a
foundation
that
would
bear
the
weight
of
the
animals
next
morning
during
the
day
several
indians
joined
us
on
these
were
made
of
a
circular
hoop
about
a
foot
in
diameter
the
interior
space
being
filled
with
an
open
network
of
bark
i
went
ahead
early
with
two
or
three
men
each
with
a
led
horse
to
break
the
road
we
were
obliged
to
abandon
the
hollow
entirely
and
work
along
the
which
was
very
steep
and
the
snow
covered
with
an
icy
crust
we
cut
a
footing
as
we
advanced
and
trampled
a
road
through
for
the
animals
but
occasionally
one
plunged
outside
the
trail
and
slided
along
the
field
to
the
bottom
a
hundred
yards
below
late
in
the
day
we
reached
another
bench
in
the
hollow
where
in
summer
the
stream
passed
over
a
small
precipice
here
was
a
short
distance
of
dividing
ground
between
the
two
ridges
and
beyond
an
open
basin
some
ten
miles
across
whose
bottom
presented
a
field
of
snow
at
the
further
or
western
side
rose
the
middle
crest
of
the
mountain
a
ridge
of
volcanic
rock
the
summit
line
presented
a
range
of
naked
peaks
apparently
destitute
of
snow
and
vegetation
but
below
the
face
of
the
whole
country
was
covered
with
timber
of
extraordinary
size
towards
a
pass
which
the
guide
indicated
here
we
attempted
in
the
afternoon
to
force
a
road
but
after
a
laborious
plunging
through
two
or
three
hundred
yards
our
best
horses
gave
out
entirely
refusing
to
make
any
further
effort
and
for
the
time
we
were
brought
to
a
stand
the
guide
informed
us
that
we
were
entering
the
deep
snow
and
here
began
the
difficulties
of
the
mountain
and
to
him
and
almost
to
all
our
enterprise
seemed
hopeless
i
returned
a
short
distance
back
to
the
break
in
the
hollow
where
i
met
fitzpatrick
the
camp
had
been
occupied
all
the
day
in
endeavoring
to
ascend
the
hill
but
only
the
best
horses
had
succeeded
the
animals
generally
not
having
sufficient
strength
to
bring
themselves
up
without
the
packs
and
all
the
line
of
road
between
this
and
the
springs
was
strewed
with
and
equipage
and
horses
floundering
in
snow
i
therefore
immediately
encamped
on
the
ground
with
my
own
mess
which
was
in
advance
and
directed
fitzpatrick
to
encamp
at
the
springs
and
send
all
the
animals
in
charge
of
tabeau
with
a
strong
guard
back
to
the
place
where
they
had
been
pastured
the
night
before
here
was
a
small
spot
of
level
ground
protected
on
one
side
by
the
mountain
and
on
the
other
sheltered
by
a
little
ridge
of
rock
it
was
an
open
grove
of
pines
which
assimilated
in
size
to
the
grandeur
of
the
mountain
being
frequently
six
feet
in
diameter
we
had
no
shelter
but
we
made
a
large
fire
around
the
trunk
of
one
of
the
huge
pines
and
covering
the
snow
with
small
boughs
on
which
we
spread
our
blankets
soon
made
ourselves
comfortable
the
night
was
very
bright
and
clear
though
the
thermometer
was
only
at
a
strong
wind
which
sprang
up
at
sundown
made
it
intensely
cold
and
this
was
one
of
the
bitterest
nights
during
the
journey
two
indians
joined
our
party
here
and
one
of
them
an
old
man
immediately
began
to
harangue
us
saying
that
ourselves
and
animals
would
perish
in
the
snow
and
that
if
we
would
go
back
he
would
show
us
another
and
a
better
way
across
the
mountain
he
spoke
in
a
very
loud
voice
and
there
was
a
singular
repetition
of
phrases
and
arrangement
of
words
which
rendered
his
speech
striking
and
not
unmusical
we
had
now
begun
to
understand
some
words
and
with
the
aid
of
signs
easily
comprehended
the
old
man
simple
ideas
rock
upon
rock
rock
upon
rock
snow
upon
snow
said
he
even
if
you
get
over
the
snow
you
will
not
be
able
to
get
down
from
the
mountains
he
made
us
the
sign
of
precipices
and
showed
us
how
the
feet
of
the
horses
would
slip
and
throw
them
off
from
the
narrow
trails
that
led
along
their
sides
our
chinook
who
comprehended
even
more
readily
than
ourselves
and
believed
our
situation
hopeless
covered
his
head
with
his
blanket
and
began
to
weep
and
lament
i
wanted
to
see
the
whites
said
he
i
came
away
from
my
own
people
to
see
the
whites
and
i
would
care
to
die
among
them
but
here
and
he
looked
around
into
the
cold
night
and
gloomy
forest
and
drawing
his
blanket
over
his
head
began
again
to
lament
seated
around
the
tree
the
fire
illuminating
the
rocks
and
the
tall
bolls
of
the
pines
round
about
and
the
old
indian
haranguing
we
presented
a
group
of
very
serious
faces
the
night
had
been
too
cold
to
sleep
and
we
were
up
very
early
our
guide
was
standing
by
the
fire
with
all
his
finery
on
and
seeing
him
shiver
in
the
cold
i
threw
on
his
shoulders
one
of
my
blankets
we
missed
him
a
few
minutes
afterwards
and
never
saw
him
again
he
had
deserted
his
bad
faith
and
treachery
were
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
estimate
of
indian
character
which
a
long
intercourse
with
this
people
had
gradually
forced
upon
my
mind
while
a
portion
of
the
camp
were
occupied
in
bringing
up
the
baggage
to
this
point
the
remainder
were
busied
in
making
sledges
and
i
had
determined
to
explore
the
mountain
ahead
and
the
sledges
were
to
be
used
in
transporting
the
baggage
the
mountains
here
consisted
wholly
of
a
white
micaceous
granite
the
day
was
perfectly
clear
and
while
the
sun
was
in
the
sky
warm
and
pleasant
by
observation
our
latitude
was
and
elevation
by
the
boiling
point
feet
accompanied
by
fitzpatrick
i
set
out
with
a
reconnoitring
party
on
we
marched
all
in
single
file
trampling
the
snow
as
heavily
as
we
could
crossing
the
open
basin
in
a
march
of
about
ten
miles
we
reached
the
top
of
one
of
the
peaks
to
the
left
of
the
pass
indicated
by
our
guide
far
below
us
dimmed
by
the
distance
was
a
large
snowless
valley
bounded
on
the
western
side
at
the
distance
of
about
a
hundred
miles
by
a
low
range
of
mountains
which
carson
recognised
with
delight
as
the
mountains
bordering
the
coast
there
said
he
is
the
little
mountain
it
is
fifteen
years
since
i
saw
it
but
i
am
just
as
sure
as
if
i
had
seen
it
yesterday
between
us
then
and
this
low
coast
range
was
the
valley
of
the
sacramento
and
no
one
who
had
not
accompanied
us
through
the
incidents
of
our
life
for
the
last
few
months
could
realize
the
delight
with
which
at
last
we
looked
down
upon
it
at
the
distance
of
apparently
miles
beyond
us
were
distinguished
spots
of
prairie
and
a
dark
line
which
could
be
traced
with
the
glass
was
imagined
to
be
the
course
of
the
river
but
we
were
evidently
at
a
great
height
above
the
valley
and
between
us
and
the
plains
extended
miles
of
snowy
fields
and
broken
ridges
of
mountains
it
was
late
in
the
day
when
we
turned
towards
the
camp
and
it
grew
rapidly
cold
as
it
drew
towards
night
one
of
the
men
became
fatigued
and
his
feet
began
to
freeze
and
building
a
fire
in
the
trunk
of
a
dry
old
cedar
fitzpatrick
remained
with
him
until
his
clothes
could
be
dried
and
he
was
in
a
condition
to
come
on
after
a
day
march
of
miles
we
straggled
into
the
camp
one
after
another
at
nightfall
the
greater
number
excessively
fatigued
only
two
of
the
party
having
ever
traveled
on
before
all
our
energies
are
now
directed
to
getting
our
animals
across
the
snow
and
it
was
supposed
that
after
all
the
baggage
had
been
drawn
with
the
sleighs
over
the
trail
we
had
made
it
would
be
sufficiently
hard
to
bear
our
animals
at
several
places
between
this
point
and
the
ridge
we
had
discovered
some
grassy
spots
where
the
wind
and
sun
had
dispersed
the
snow
from
the
sides
of
the
hills
and
these
were
to
form
to
support
the
animals
for
a
night
in
their
passage
across
on
our
way
across
we
had
set
on
fire
several
broken
stumps
and
dried
trees
to
melt
holes
in
the
snow
for
the
camps
its
general
depth
was
five
feet
but
we
passed
over
places
where
it
was
feet
deep
as
shown
by
the
trees
with
one
party
drawing
sleighs
loaded
with
baggage
i
advanced
about
four
miles
along
the
trail
and
encamped
at
the
first
grassy
spot
where
we
expected
to
bring
our
horses
fitzpatrick
with
another
party
remained
behind
to
form
an
intermediate
station
between
us
and
the
animals
the
night
has
been
extremely
cold
but
perfectly
still
and
beautifully
clear
before
the
sun
appeared
this
morning
the
thermometer
was
below
zero
higher
when
his
rays
struck
the
lofty
peaks
and
when
they
reached
our
camp
scenery
and
weather
combined
must
render
these
mountains
beautiful
in
summer
the
purity
and
color
of
the
sky
are
singularly
beautiful
the
days
are
sunny
and
bright
and
even
warm
in
the
noon
hours
and
if
we
could
be
free
from
the
many
anxieties
that
oppress
us
even
now
we
would
be
delighted
here
but
our
provisions
are
getting
fearfully
scant
sleighs
arrived
with
baggage
about
ten
and
leaving
a
portion
of
it
here
we
continued
on
for
a
mile
and
a
half
and
encamped
at
the
foot
of
a
long
hill
on
this
side
of
the
open
bottom
bernier
and
godey
who
yesterday
morning
had
been
sent
to
ascend
a
higher
peak
got
in
hungry
and
fatigued
they
confirmed
what
we
had
already
seen
two
other
sleighs
arrived
in
the
afternoon
and
the
men
being
fatigued
i
gave
them
all
tea
and
sugar
snow
clouds
began
to
rise
in
the
and
apprehensive
of
a
storm
which
would
destroy
our
road
i
sent
the
people
back
to
fitzpatrick
with
directions
to
send
for
the
animals
in
the
morning
with
me
remained
preuss
talbot
and
carson
with
jacob
elevation
of
the
camp
by
the
boiling
point
is
feet
during
the
night
the
weather
changed
the
wind
rising
to
a
gale
and
commencing
to
snow
before
daylight
before
morning
the
trail
was
covered
we
remained
quiet
in
camp
all
day
in
the
course
of
which
the
weather
improved
four
sleighs
arrived
towards
evening
with
the
bedding
of
the
men
we
suffer
much
from
the
want
of
salt
and
all
the
men
are
becoming
weak
from
insufficient
food
taplin
was
sent
back
with
a
few
men
to
assist
fitzpatrick
and
continuing
on
with
three
sleighs
carrying
a
part
of
the
baggage
we
had
the
satisfaction
to
encamp
within
two
and
a
half
miles
of
the
head
of
the
hollow
and
at
the
foot
of
the
last
mountain
ridge
here
two
large
trees
had
been
set
on
fire
and
in
the
holes
where
the
snow
had
been
melted
away
we
found
a
comfortable
camp
the
wind
kept
the
air
filled
with
snow
during
the
day
the
sky
was
very
dark
in
the
southwest
though
elsewhere
very
clear
the
forest
here
has
a
noble
appearance
and
tall
cedar
is
abundant
its
greatest
height
being
feet
and
circumference
three
or
four
feet
above
the
ground
and
here
i
see
for
the
first
time
the
white
pine
of
which
there
are
some
magnificent
trees
hemlock
spruce
is
among
the
timber
occasionally
as
large
as
eight
feet
in
diameter
four
feet
above
the
ground
but
in
ascending
it
tapers
rapidly
to
less
than
one
foot
at
the
height
of
eighty
feet
i
have
not
seen
any
higher
than
feet
and
the
slight
upper
part
is
frequently
broken
off
by
the
wind
the
white
spruce
is
frequent
and
the
red
pine
of
the
mexicans
which
constitutes
the
beautiful
forest
along
the
banks
of
the
sierra
nevada
to
the
northward
is
here
the
principal
tree
not
attaining
a
greater
height
than
feet
though
with
sometimes
a
diameter
of
most
of
these
trees
appeared
to
differ
slightly
from
those
of
the
same
kind
on
the
other
side
of
the
continent
the
elevation
of
the
camp
by
the
boiling
point
is
feet
we
are
now
feet
above
the
level
of
the
south
pass
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
still
we
are
not
done
ascending
the
top
of
a
flat
ridge
near
was
bare
of
snow
and
very
well
sprinkled
with
sufficient
to
pasture
the
animals
two
or
three
days
and
this
was
to
be
their
main
point
of
support
this
ridge
is
composed
of
a
compact
trap
or
basalt
of
a
columnar
structure
over
the
surface
are
scattered
large
boulders
of
porous
trap
the
hills
are
in
many
places
entirely
covered
with
small
fragments
of
volcanic
rock
putting
on
our
we
spent
the
afternoon
in
exploring
a
road
ahead
the
glare
of
the
snow
combined
with
great
fatigue
had
rendered
many
of
the
people
nearly
blind
but
we
were
fortunate
in
having
some
black
silk
handkerchiefs
which
worn
as
veils
very
much
relieved
the
eye
high
wind
continued
and
our
trail
this
morning
was
nearly
invisible
here
and
there
indicated
by
a
little
ridge
of
snow
our
situation
became
tiresome
and
dreary
requiring
a
strong
exercise
of
patience
and
resolution
in
the
evening
i
received
a
message
from
fitzpatrick
acquainting
me
with
the
utter
failure
of
his
attempt
to
get
our
mules
and
horses
over
the
snow
the
trail
had
proved
entirely
too
slight
to
support
them
and
they
had
broken
through
and
were
plunging
about
or
lying
half
buried
in
snow
he
was
occupied
in
endeavoring
to
get
them
back
to
his
camp
and
in
the
mean
time
sent
to
me
for
further
instructions
i
wrote
to
him
to
send
the
animals
immediately
back
to
their
old
pastures
and
after
having
made
mauls
and
shovels
turn
in
all
the
strength
of
his
party
to
open
and
beat
a
road
through
the
snow
strengthening
it
with
branches
and
boughs
of
the
pines
we
made
mauls
and
worked
hard
at
our
end
of
the
road
all
day
the
wind
was
high
but
the
sun
bright
and
the
snow
thawing
we
worked
down
the
face
of
the
hill
to
meet
the
people
at
the
other
end
towards
sundown
it
began
to
grow
cold
and
we
shouldered
our
mauls
and
trudged
back
to
camp
we
continued
to
labor
on
the
road
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
the
people
working
down
the
face
of
the
opposite
hill
about
three
miles
distant
during
the
morning
we
had
the
pleasure
of
a
visit
from
fitzpatrick
with
the
information
that
all
was
going
on
well
a
party
of
indians
had
passed
on
who
said
they
were
going
to
the
western
side
of
the
mountain
after
fish
this
was
an
indication
that
the
salmon
were
coming
up
the
streams
and
we
could
hardly
restrain
our
impatience
as
we
thought
of
them
and
worked
with
increased
vigor
the
meat
train
did
not
arrive
this
evening
and
i
gave
godey
leave
to
kill
our
little
dog
tlamath
which
he
prepared
in
indian
fashion
scorching
off
the
hair
and
washing
the
skin
with
soap
and
snow
and
then
cutting
it
up
into
pieces
which
were
laid
on
the
snow
shortly
afterwards
the
sleigh
arrived
with
a
supply
of
and
we
had
an
extraordinary
dinner
mule
and
dog
the
dividing
ridge
of
the
sierra
is
in
sight
from
this
encampment
accompanied
by
preuss
i
ascended
the
highest
peak
to
the
right
from
which
we
had
a
beautiful
view
of
a
mountain
lake
at
our
feet
about
fifteen
miles
in
length
and
so
entirely
surrounded
by
mountains
that
we
could
not
discover
an
outlet
we
had
taken
with
us
a
glass
but
though
we
enjoyed
an
extended
view
the
valley
was
half
hidden
in
mist
as
when
we
had
seen
it
before
snow
could
be
distinguished
on
the
higher
parts
of
the
coast
mountains
eastward
as
far
as
the
eye
could
extend
it
ranged
over
a
terrible
mass
of
broken
snowy
mountains
fading
off
blue
in
the
distance
the
rock
composing
the
summit
consists
of
a
very
coarse
dark
volcanic
conglomerate
the
lower
parts
appeared
to
be
of
a
slaty
structure
the
highest
trees
were
a
few
scattering
cedars
and
aspens
from
the
immediate
foot
of
the
peak
we
were
two
hours
reaching
the
summit
and
one
hour
and
a
quarter
in
descending
the
day
had
been
very
bright
still
and
clear
and
spring
seems
to
be
advancing
rapidly
while
the
sun
is
in
the
sky
the
snow
melts
rapidly
and
gushing
springs
cover
the
face
of
the
mountain
in
all
the
exposed
places
but
their
surface
freezes
instantly
with
the
disappearance
of
the
sun
i
obtained
some
observations
and
the
result
from
these
and
others
made
during
our
stay
gives
for
the
latitude
longitude
and
rate
of
the
chronometer
we
had
succeeded
in
getting
our
animals
safely
to
the
first
grassy
hill
and
this
morning
i
started
with
jacob
on
a
reconnoitring
expedition
beyond
the
mountain
we
traveled
along
the
crests
of
narrow
ridges
extending
down
from
the
mountain
in
the
direction
of
the
valley
from
which
the
snow
was
fast
melting
away
on
the
open
spots
was
tolerably
good
grass
and
i
judged
we
should
succeed
in
getting
the
camp
down
by
way
of
these
towards
sundown
we
discovered
some
icy
spots
in
a
deep
hollow
and
descending
the
mountain
we
encamped
on
the
of
a
little
creek
where
at
last
the
water
found
its
way
to
the
pacific
the
night
was
clear
and
very
long
we
heard
the
cries
of
some
wild
animals
which
had
been
attracted
by
our
fire
and
a
flock
of
geese
passed
over
during
the
night
even
these
strange
sounds
had
something
pleasant
to
our
senses
in
this
region
of
silence
and
desolation
we
started
again
early
in
the
morning
the
creek
acquired
a
regular
breadth
of
about
feet
and
we
soon
began
to
hear
the
rushing
of
the
water
below
the
icy
surface
over
which
we
traveled
to
avoid
the
snow
a
few
miles
below
we
broke
through
where
the
water
was
several
feet
deep
and
halted
to
make
a
fire
and
dry
our
clothes
we
continued
a
few
miles
farther
walking
being
very
laborious
without
i
was
now
perfectly
satisfied
that
we
had
struck
the
stream
on
which
sutler
lived
and
turning
about
made
a
hard
push
and
reached
the
camp
at
dark
here
we
had
the
pleasure
to
find
all
the
remaining
animals
in
number
safely
arrived
at
the
grassy
hill
near
the
camp
and
here
also
we
were
agreeably
surprised
with
the
sight
of
an
abundance
of
salt
some
of
the
had
gone
to
a
neighboring
hut
for
pine
nuts
and
discovered
unexpectedly
a
large
cake
of
very
white
salt
which
the
indians
told
them
they
had
brought
from
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
they
used
it
to
eat
with
their
pine
nuts
and
readily
sold
it
for
goods
on
the
the
people
were
occupied
in
making
a
road
and
bringing
up
the
baggage
and
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
we
encamped
with
the
animals
and
all
the
of
the
camp
on
the
summit
of
the
pass
in
the
dividing
ridge
miles
by
our
traveled
road
from
the
dalles
to
the
columbia
the
people
who
had
not
yet
been
to
this
point
climbed
the
neighboring
peak
to
enjoy
a
look
at
the
valley
the
temperature
of
boiling
water
gave
for
the
elevation
of
the
encampment
feet
above
the
sea
this
was
feet
higher
than
the
south
pass
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
several
peaks
in
view
rose
several
thousand
feet
still
higher
thus
at
the
extremity
of
the
continent
and
near
the
coast
the
phenomenon
was
seen
of
a
range
of
mountains
still
higher
than
the
great
rocky
mountains
themselves
this
extraordinary
fact
accounts
for
the
great
basin
and
shows
that
there
must
be
a
system
of
small
lakes
and
rivers
here
scattered
over
a
flat
country
and
which
the
extended
and
lofty
range
of
the
sierra
nevada
prevents
from
escaping
to
the
pacific
ocean
latitude
longitude
thus
the
pass
in
the
sierra
nevada
which
so
well
deserves
its
name
of
snowy
mountain
is
eleven
degrees
west
and
about
four
degrees
south
of
the
south
pass
we
now
considered
ourselves
victorious
over
the
mountain
having
only
the
descent
before
us
and
the
valley
under
our
eyes
we
felt
strong
hope
that
we
should
force
our
way
down
but
this
was
a
case
in
which
the
descent
was
facile
still
deep
fields
of
snow
lay
between
them
and
there
was
a
large
intervening
space
of
mountains
through
which
we
had
yet
to
wind
our
way
carson
roused
me
this
morning
with
an
early
fire
and
we
were
all
up
long
before
day
in
order
to
pass
the
before
the
sun
should
render
the
crust
soft
we
enjoyed
this
morning
a
scene
at
sunrise
which
even
here
was
unusually
glorious
and
beautiful
immediately
above
the
eastern
mountains
was
repeated
a
mass
of
purple
ranges
bordered
with
bright
yellow
gold
the
peaks
shot
up
into
a
narrow
line
of
crimson
cloud
above
which
the
air
was
filled
with
a
greenish
orange
and
over
all
was
the
singular
beauty
of
the
blue
sky
passing
along
a
ridge
which
commanded
the
lake
on
our
right
of
which
we
began
to
discover
an
outlet
through
a
chasm
on
the
west
we
passed
over
alternating
open
ground
and
which
supported
the
animals
and
encamped
on
the
ridge
after
a
journey
of
six
miles
the
grass
was
better
than
we
had
yet
seen
and
we
were
encamped
in
a
clump
of
trees
or
feet
high
resembling
white
pine
with
the
exception
of
these
small
clumps
the
ridges
were
bare
and
where
the
snow
found
the
support
of
the
trees
the
wind
had
blown
it
up
into
banks
or
feet
high
it
required
much
care
to
hunt
out
a
practicable
way
as
the
most
open
places
frequently
led
to
impassable
banks
we
had
hard
and
doubtful
labor
yet
before
us
as
the
snow
appeared
to
be
heavier
where
the
timber
began
further
down
with
few
open
spots
ascending
a
height
we
traced
out
the
best
line
we
could
discover
for
the
next
day
march
and
had
at
least
the
consolation
to
see
that
the
mountain
descended
rapidly
the
day
had
been
one
of
april
gusty
with
a
few
occasional
flakes
of
snow
which
in
the
afternoon
enveloped
the
upper
mountain
in
clouds
we
watched
them
anxiously
as
now
we
dreaded
a
shortly
afterwards
we
heard
the
roll
of
thunder
and
looking
towards
the
valley
found
it
enveloped
in
a
for
us
as
connected
with
the
idea
of
summer
it
had
a
singular
charm
and
we
watched
its
progress
with
excited
feelings
until
nearly
sunset
when
the
sky
cleared
off
brightly
and
we
saw
a
shining
line
of
water
directing
its
course
towards
another
a
broader
and
larger
sheet
we
knew
that
these
could
be
no
other
than
the
sacramento
and
the
bay
of
san
francisco
but
after
our
long
wandering
in
rugged
mountains
where
so
frequently
we
had
met
with
disappointments
and
where
the
crossing
of
every
ridge
displayed
some
unknown
lake
or
river
we
were
yet
almost
afraid
to
believe
that
we
were
at
last
to
escape
into
the
genial
country
of
which
we
had
heard
so
many
glowing
descriptions
and
dreaded
to
find
some
vast
interior
lake
whose
bitter
waters
would
bring
us
disappointment
on
the
southern
shore
of
what
appeared
to
be
the
bay
could
be
traced
the
gleaming
line
where
entered
another
large
stream
and
again
the
buenaventura
rose
up
in
our
minds
carson
had
entered
the
valley
along
the
southern
side
of
the
bay
and
remembered
perfectly
to
have
crossed
the
mouth
of
a
very
large
stream
which
they
had
been
obliged
to
raft
but
the
country
then
was
so
entirely
covered
with
water
from
snow
and
rain
that
he
had
been
able
to
form
no
correct
impressions
of
we
had
the
satisfaction
to
know
that
at
least
there
were
people
below
fires
were
lit
up
in
the
valley
just
at
night
appearing
to
be
in
answer
to
ours
and
these
signs
of
life
renewed
in
some
measure
the
gayety
of
the
camp
they
appeared
so
near
that
we
judged
them
to
be
among
the
timber
of
some
of
the
neighboring
ridges
but
having
them
constantly
in
view
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
we
afterwards
found
them
to
be
fires
that
had
been
kindled
by
the
indians
among
the
on
the
shore
of
the
bay
miles
distant
among
the
very
few
plants
that
appeared
here
was
the
common
blue
flax
a
mule
was
killed
for
food
our
breakfast
was
over
long
before
day
we
took
advantage
of
the
coolness
of
the
early
morning
to
get
over
the
snow
which
occurred
in
very
deep
banks
among
the
timber
but
we
searched
out
the
coldest
places
and
the
animals
passed
successfully
with
their
loads
over
the
hard
crust
now
and
then
the
delay
of
making
a
road
occasioned
much
labor
and
loss
of
time
in
the
after
part
of
the
day
we
saw
before
us
a
handsome
grassy
ridge
point
and
making
a
desperate
push
over
a
to
feet
deep
we
happily
succeeded
in
getting
the
camp
across
and
encamped
on
the
ridge
after
a
march
of
three
miles
we
had
again
the
prospect
of
a
below
and
we
killed
another
mule
now
our
only
resource
from
starvation
we
satisfied
ourselves
during
the
day
that
the
lake
had
an
outlet
between
two
ranges
on
the
right
and
with
this
the
creek
on
which
i
had
encamped
probably
effected
a
junction
below
between
these
we
were
descending
we
continued
to
enjoy
the
same
delightful
weather
the
sky
of
the
same
beautiful
blue
and
such
a
sunset
and
sunrise
as
on
our
atlantic
coast
we
could
scarcely
imagine
and
here
among
the
mountains
feet
above
the
sea
we
have
the
sky
and
sunny
climate
of
smyrna
and
palermo
which
a
little
map
before
me
shows
are
in
the
same
latitude
the
elevation
above
the
sea
by
the
boiling
point
is
feet
this
was
our
most
difficult
day
we
were
forced
off
the
ridges
by
the
quantity
of
snow
among
the
timber
and
obliged
to
take
to
the
mountain
sides
where
occasionally
rocks
and
a
southern
exposure
afforded
us
a
chance
to
scramble
along
but
these
were
steep
and
slippery
with
snow
and
ice
and
the
tough
evergreens
of
the
mountain
impeded
our
way
tore
our
skins
and
exhausted
our
patience
some
of
us
had
the
misfortune
to
wear
moccasins
with
soles
so
slippery
that
we
could
not
keep
our
feet
and
generally
crawled
across
the
axes
and
mauls
were
necessary
to
make
a
road
through
the
snow
going
ahead
with
carson
to
reconnoitre
the
road
we
reached
in
the
afternoon
the
river
which
made
the
outlet
of
the
lake
carson
sprang
over
clear
across
a
place
where
the
stream
was
compressed
among
rocks
but
the
sole
of
my
moccasin
glanced
from
the
icy
rock
and
precipitated
me
into
the
river
it
was
some
few
seconds
before
i
could
recover
myself
in
the
current
and
carson
thinking
me
hurt
jumped
in
after
me
and
we
both
had
an
icy
bath
we
tried
to
search
awhile
for
my
gun
which
had
been
lost
in
the
fall
but
the
cold
drove
us
out
and
making
a
large
fire
on
the
bank
after
we
had
partially
dried
ourselves
we
went
back
to
meet
the
camp
we
afterwards
found
that
the
gun
had
been
slung
under
the
ice
which
lined
the
banks
of
the
creek
using
our
old
plan
of
breaking
roads
with
alternate
horses
we
reached
the
creek
in
the
evening
and
encamped
on
a
dry
open
place
in
the
ravine
another
branch
which
we
had
followed
here
comes
in
on
the
left
and
from
this
point
the
mountain
wall
on
which
we
had
traveled
faces
to
the
south
along
the
right
bank
of
the
river
where
the
sun
appears
to
have
melted
the
snow
but
the
opposite
ridge
is
entirely
covered
here
among
the
pines
the
produces
but
little
grass
barely
sufficient
to
keep
life
in
the
animals
we
had
the
pleasure
to
be
rained
upon
this
afternoon
and
grass
was
now
our
greatest
solicitude
many
of
the
men
looked
badly
and
some
this
evening
were
giving
out
we
rose
at
three
in
the
morning
for
an
astronomical
observation
and
obtained
for
the
place
a
lat
of
long
the
sky
was
clear
and
pure
with
a
sharp
wind
from
the
northeast
and
the
thermometer
below
the
freezing
point
we
continued
down
the
south
face
of
the
mountain
our
road
leading
over
dry
ground
we
were
able
to
avoid
the
snow
almost
entirely
in
the
course
of
the
morning
we
struck
a
footpath
which
we
were
generally
able
to
keep
and
the
ground
was
soft
to
our
animals
feet
being
sandy
or
covered
with
mould
green
grass
began
to
make
its
appearance
and
occasionally
we
passed
a
hill
scatteringly
covered
with
it
the
character
of
the
forest
continued
the
same
and
among
the
trees
the
pine
with
sharp
leaves
and
very
large
cones
was
abundant
some
of
them
being
noble
trees
we
measured
one
that
had
feet
diameter
though
the
height
was
not
more
than
feet
all
along
the
river
was
a
roaring
torrent
its
fall
very
great
and
descending
with
a
rapidity
to
which
we
had
long
been
strangers
to
our
great
pleasure
appeared
on
the
ridge
and
soon
became
very
frequent
on
these
i
remarked
great
quantities
of
mistletoe
rushes
began
to
make
their
appearance
and
at
a
small
creek
where
they
were
abundant
one
of
the
messes
was
left
with
the
weakest
horses
while
we
continued
on
the
opposite
was
very
steep
and
continuous
unbroken
by
ravines
and
covered
with
pines
and
snow
while
on
the
side
we
were
traveling
innumerable
rivulets
poured
down
from
the
ridge
continuing
on
we
halted
a
moment
at
one
of
these
rivulets
to
admire
some
beautiful
resembling
which
shaded
the
little
stream
they
were
forty
to
fifty
feet
high
and
two
in
diameter
with
a
uniform
tufted
top
and
the
summer
green
of
their
beautiful
foliage
with
the
singing
birds
and
the
sweet
summer
wind
which
was
whirling
about
the
dry
oak
leaves
nearly
intoxicated
us
with
delight
and
we
hurried
on
filled
with
excitement
to
escape
entirely
from
the
horrid
region
of
inhospitable
snow
to
the
perpetual
spring
of
the
sacramento
when
we
had
traveled
about
ten
miles
the
valley
opened
a
little
to
an
oak
and
pine
bottom
through
which
ran
rivulets
closely
bordered
with
rushes
on
which
our
horses
fell
with
avidity
and
here
we
made
our
encampment
here
the
roaring
torrent
has
already
become
a
river
and
we
had
descended
to
an
elevation
of
feet
along
our
road
the
rock
was
a
white
granite
which
appears
to
constitute
the
upper
part
of
the
mountains
on
both
the
eastern
and
western
slopes
while
between
the
central
is
a
volcanic
rock
another
horse
was
killed
for
food
believing
that
the
difficulties
of
the
road
were
passed
and
leaving
fitzpatrick
to
follow
slowly
as
the
condition
of
the
animals
required
i
started
ahead
this
morning
with
a
party
of
eight
consisting
of
myself
preuss
and
talbot
carson
derosier
towns
proue
and
jacob
we
took
with
us
some
of
the
best
animals
and
my
intention
was
to
proceed
as
rapidly
as
possible
to
the
house
of
sutter
and
return
to
meet
the
party
with
a
supply
of
provisions
and
fresh
animals
continuing
down
the
river
which
pursued
a
very
direct
westerly
course
through
a
narrow
valley
with
only
a
very
slight
and
narrow
we
made
twelve
miles
and
encamped
at
some
old
indian
huts
apparently
a
on
the
river
the
bottom
was
covered
with
trees
of
deciduous
foliage
and
overgrown
with
vines
and
rushes
on
a
bench
of
the
hill
near
by
was
a
hill
of
fresh
green
grass
six
inches
long
in
some
of
the
tufts
which
i
had
the
curiosity
to
measure
the
animals
were
driven
here
and
i
spent
part
of
the
afternoon
sitting
on
a
large
rock
among
them
enjoying
the
pauseless
rapidity
with
which
they
luxuriated
on
the
unaccustomed
food
the
forest
was
imposing
in
the
magnificence
of
the
trees
some
of
the
pines
bearing
large
cones
were
feet
in
diameter
cedars
also
abounded
and
we
measured
one
feet
in
circumference
four
feet
from
the
ground
this
noble
tree
seemed
here
to
be
in
its
proper
soil
and
climate
we
found
it
on
both
sides
of
the
sierra
but
most
abundant
on
the
west
we
continued
to
follow
the
stream
the
mountains
on
either
hand
increasing
in
height
as
we
descended
and
shutting
up
the
river
narrowly
in
precipices
along
which
we
had
great
difficulty
to
get
our
horses
it
rained
heavily
during
the
afternoon
and
we
were
forced
off
the
river
to
the
heights
above
whence
we
descended
at
the
point
of
a
spur
between
the
river
and
a
fork
of
nearly
equal
size
coming
in
from
the
right
here
we
saw
on
the
lower
hills
the
first
flowers
in
bloom
which
occurred
suddenly
and
in
considerable
quantity
one
of
them
a
species
of
the
current
in
both
streams
rather
torrents
than
rivers
was
broken
by
large
boulders
it
was
late
and
the
animals
fatigued
and
not
succeeding
to
find
a
ford
immediately
we
encamped
although
the
afforded
but
a
few
stray
bunches
of
grass
and
the
horses
standing
about
in
the
rain
looked
very
miserable
we
succeeded
in
fording
the
stream
and
made
a
trail
by
which
we
crossed
the
point
of
the
opposite
hill
which
on
the
southern
exposure
was
prettily
covered
with
green
grass
and
we
halted
a
mile
from
our
last
encampment
the
river
was
only
about
feet
wide
but
rapid
and
occasionally
deep
foaming
among
boulders
and
the
water
beautifully
clear
we
encamped
on
the
as
there
was
no
bottom
level
and
the
opposite
ridge
is
continuous
affording
no
streams
we
had
with
us
a
large
kettle
and
a
mule
being
killed
here
his
head
was
boiled
in
it
for
several
hours
and
made
a
passable
soup
for
famished
people
below
precipices
on
the
river
forced
us
to
the
heights
which
we
ascended
by
a
steep
spur
feet
high
my
favorite
horse
proveau
had
become
very
weak
and
was
scarcely
able
to
bring
himself
to
the
top
traveling
here
was
good
except
in
crossing
the
ravines
which
were
narrow
steep
and
frequent
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
deer
the
first
animal
we
had
seen
but
did
not
succeed
in
approaching
him
proveau
could
not
keep
up
and
i
left
jacob
to
bring
him
on
being
obliged
to
press
forward
with
the
party
as
there
was
no
grass
in
the
forest
we
grew
very
anxious
as
the
day
advanced
and
no
grass
appeared
for
the
lives
of
our
animals
depended
on
finding
it
they
were
in
just
such
a
condition
that
grass
and
repose
for
the
night
enabled
them
to
get
on
the
next
day
every
hour
we
had
been
expecting
to
see
open
out
before
us
the
valley
which
from
the
mountain
above
seemed
almost
at
our
feet
a
new
and
singular
shrub
which
had
made
its
appearance
since
crossing
the
mountain
was
very
frequent
it
branched
out
near
the
ground
forming
a
clump
eight
to
ten
feet
high
with
leaves
of
an
oval
form
and
the
body
and
branches
had
a
naked
appearance
as
if
stripped
of
the
bark
which
is
very
smooth
and
thin
of
a
chocolate
color
contrasting
well
with
the
pale
green
of
the
leaves
the
day
was
nearly
gone
we
had
made
a
hard
day
march
and
found
no
grass
towns
became
wandering
off
into
the
woods
without
knowing
where
he
was
going
and
jacob
brought
him
back
near
we
descended
into
the
steep
ravine
of
a
handsome
creek
feet
wide
and
i
was
engaged
in
getting
the
horses
up
the
opposite
hill
when
i
heard
a
shout
from
carson
who
had
gone
ahead
a
few
hundred
yards
life
yet
said
he
as
he
came
up
life
yet
i
have
found
a
sprinkled
with
grass
enough
for
the
night
we
drove
along
our
horses
and
encamped
at
the
place
about
dark
and
there
was
just
room
enough
to
make
a
place
for
shelter
on
the
edge
of
the
stream
three
horses
were
lost
proveau
a
fine
young
horse
from
the
columbia
belonging
to
charles
towns
and
another
indian
horse
which
carried
our
cooking
utensils
the
two
former
gave
out
and
the
latter
strayed
off
into
the
woods
as
we
reached
the
camp
we
lay
shut
up
in
the
narrow
ravine
and
gave
the
animals
a
necessary
day
and
men
were
sent
back
after
the
others
derosier
volunteered
to
bring
up
proveau
to
whom
he
knew
i
was
greatly
attached
as
he
had
been
my
favorite
horse
on
both
expeditions
carson
and
i
climbed
one
of
the
nearest
mountains
the
forest
land
still
extended
ahead
and
the
valley
appeared
as
far
as
ever
the
was
found
near
the
camp
but
derosier
did
not
get
in
march
derosier
did
not
get
in
during
the
night
and
leaving
him
to
follow
as
no
grass
remained
here
we
continued
on
over
the
uplands
crossing
many
small
streams
and
camped
again
on
the
river
having
made
six
miles
here
we
found
the
hillside
covered
although
lightly
with
fresh
green
grass
and
from
this
time
forward
we
found
it
always
improving
and
abundant
we
made
a
pleasant
camp
on
the
river
hill
where
were
some
beautiful
specimens
of
the
shrub
which
were
a
foot
in
diameter
near
the
ground
and
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
high
the
opposite
ridge
runs
continuously
along
unbroken
by
streams
we
are
rapidly
descending
into
the
spring
and
we
are
leaving
our
snowy
region
far
behind
every
thing
is
getting
green
butterflies
are
swarming
numerous
bugs
are
creeping
out
wakened
from
their
winter
sleep
and
the
forest
flowers
are
coming
into
bloom
among
those
which
appeared
most
numerously
was
we
began
to
be
uneasy
at
derosier
absence
fearing
he
might
have
been
bewildered
in
the
woods
charles
towns
who
had
not
yet
recovered
his
mind
went
to
swim
in
the
river
as
if
it
were
summer
and
the
stream
placid
when
it
was
a
cold
mountain
torrent
foaming
among
the
rocks
we
were
happy
to
see
derosier
appear
in
the
evening
he
came
in
and
sitting
down
by
the
fire
began
to
tell
us
where
he
had
been
he
imagined
he
had
been
gone
several
days
and
thought
we
were
still
at
the
camp
where
he
had
left
us
and
we
were
pained
to
see
that
his
mind
was
deranged
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
lost
in
the
mountain
and
hunger
and
fatigue
joined
to
weakness
of
body
and
fear
of
perishing
in
the
mountains
had
crazed
him
the
times
were
severe
when
stout
men
lost
their
minds
from
extremity
of
suffering
when
horses
died
and
when
mules
and
horses
ready
to
die
of
starvation
were
killed
for
food
yet
there
was
no
murmuring
or
hesitation
a
short
distance
below
our
encampment
the
river
mountains
terminated
in
precipices
and
after
a
fatiguing
march
of
only
a
few
miles
we
encamped
on
a
bench
where
there
were
springs
and
an
abundance
of
the
freshest
grass
in
the
mean
time
preuss
continued
on
down
the
river
and
unaware
that
we
had
encamped
so
early
in
the
day
was
lost
when
night
arrived
and
he
did
not
come
in
we
began
to
understand
what
had
happened
to
him
but
it
was
too
late
to
make
any
search
we
followed
preuss
trail
for
a
considerable
distance
along
the
river
until
we
reached
a
place
where
he
had
descended
to
the
stream
below
and
encamped
here
we
shouted
and
fired
guns
but
received
no
answer
and
we
concluded
that
he
had
pushed
on
down
the
stream
i
determined
to
keep
out
from
the
river
along
which
it
was
nearly
impracticable
to
travel
with
animals
until
it
should
form
a
valley
at
every
step
the
country
improved
in
beauty
the
pines
were
rapidly
disappearing
and
oaks
became
the
principal
trees
of
the
forest
among
these
the
prevailing
tree
was
the
evergreen
oak
which
by
way
of
distinction
we
call
the
and
with
these
occurred
frequently
a
new
species
of
oak
bearing
a
long
slender
acorn
from
an
inch
to
an
inch
and
a
half
in
length
which
we
now
began
to
see
formed
the
principal
vegetable
food
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
region
in
a
short
distance
we
crossed
a
little
rivulet
where
were
two
old
huts
and
near
by
were
heaps
of
acorn
hulls
the
ground
round
about
was
very
rich
covered
with
an
exuberant
sward
of
grass
and
we
sat
down
for
a
while
in
the
shade
of
the
oaks
to
let
the
animals
feed
we
repeated
our
shouts
for
preuss
and
this
time
were
gratified
with
an
answer
the
voice
grew
rapidly
nearer
ascending
from
the
river
but
when
we
expected
to
see
him
emerge
it
ceased
entirely
we
had
called
up
some
straggling
indian
the
first
we
had
met
although
for
two
days
back
we
had
seen
tracks
who
mistaking
us
for
his
fellows
had
been
only
undeceived
on
getting
close
up
it
would
have
been
pleasant
to
witness
his
astonishment
he
would
not
have
been
more
frightened
had
some
of
the
old
mountain
spirits
they
are
so
much
afraid
of
suddenly
appeared
in
his
path
ignorant
of
the
character
of
these
people
we
had
now
an
additional
cause
of
uneasiness
in
regard
to
preuss
he
had
no
arms
with
him
and
we
began
to
think
his
chance
doubtful
we
followed
on
a
trail
still
keeping
out
from
the
river
and
descended
to
a
very
large
creek
dashing
with
great
velocity
over
a
rocky
bed
and
among
large
boulders
the
bed
had
sudden
breaks
formed
by
deep
holes
and
ledges
of
rock
running
across
even
here
it
deserves
the
name
of
creek
which
we
gave
to
it
we
succeeded
in
fording
it
and
toiled
about
three
thousand
feet
up
the
opposite
hill
the
mountains
now
were
getting
sensibly
lower
but
still
there
is
no
valley
on
the
river
which
presents
steep
and
rocky
banks
but
here
several
miles
from
the
river
the
country
is
smooth
and
grassy
the
forest
has
no
undergrowth
and
in
the
open
valleys
of
rivulets
or
around
the
low
groves
of
give
the
appearance
of
orchards
in
an
old
cultivated
country
occasionally
we
met
deer
but
had
not
the
necessary
time
for
hunting
at
one
of
these
we
encamped
about
noon
to
make
an
effort
for
preuss
one
man
took
his
way
along
a
spur
leading
into
the
river
in
hope
to
cross
his
trail
and
another
took
our
own
back
both
were
volunteers
and
to
the
successful
man
was
promised
a
pair
of
pistols
not
as
a
reward
but
as
a
token
of
gratitude
for
a
service
which
would
free
us
all
from
much
anxiety
we
had
among
our
few
animals
a
horse
which
was
so
much
reduced
that
with
traveling
even
the
good
grass
could
nor
save
him
and
having
nothing
to
eat
he
was
killed
this
afternoon
he
was
a
good
animal
and
had
made
the
journey
round
from
fort
hall
continued
the
characteristic
plant
in
flower
and
the
shrub
already
mentioned
continued
characteristic
beginning
to
put
forth
a
small
white
blossom
at
evening
the
men
returned
having
seen
or
heard
nothing
of
preuss
and
i
determined
to
make
a
hard
push
down
the
river
the
next
morning
and
get
ahead
of
him
we
continued
rapidly
along
on
a
broad
trail
the
mere
traveling
and
breathing
the
delightful
air
being
a
positive
enjoyment
our
road
led
along
a
ridge
inclining
to
the
river
and
the
air
and
the
open
grounds
were
fragrant
with
flowering
shrubs
and
in
the
course
of
the
morning
we
issued
on
an
open
spur
by
which
we
descended
directly
to
the
stream
here
the
river
issues
suddenly
from
the
mountains
which
hitherto
had
hemmed
it
closely
in
these
now
become
softer
and
change
sensibly
their
character
and
at
this
point
commences
the
most
beautiful
valley
in
which
we
had
ever
traveled
we
hurried
to
the
river
on
which
we
noticed
a
small
sand
beach
to
which
preuss
would
naturally
have
gone
we
found
no
trace
of
him
but
instead
were
recent
tracks
of
indians
and
little
piles
of
and
old
fires
where
they
had
roasted
the
fish
we
traveled
on
over
the
river
grounds
which
were
undulating
and
covered
with
grass
to
the
river
brink
we
halted
to
noon
a
few
miles
beyond
always
under
the
shade
of
the
evergreen
oaks
which
formed
open
groves
on
the
bottoms
continuing
our
road
in
the
afternoon
we
ascended
to
the
uplands
where
the
river
passes
round
a
point
of
great
beauty
and
goes
through
very
remarkable
dalles
in
character
resembling
those
of
the
columbia
beyond
we
again
descended
to
the
bottoms
where
we
found
an
indian
village
consisting
of
two
or
three
huts
we
had
come
upon
them
suddenly
and
the
people
had
evidently
just
run
off
the
huts
were
low
and
slight
made
like
beehives
in
a
picture
five
or
six
feet
high
and
near
each
was
a
crate
formed
of
interlaced
branches
and
grass
in
size
and
shape
like
a
very
large
hogshead
each
of
these
contained
from
six
to
nine
bushels
these
were
filled
with
the
long
acorns
already
mentioned
and
in
the
huts
were
several
baskets
containing
quantities
of
the
acorns
roasted
they
were
sweet
and
agreeably
flavored
and
we
supplied
ourselves
with
about
half
a
bushel
leaving
one
of
our
shirts
a
handkerchief
and
some
smaller
articles
in
exchange
the
river
again
entered
for
a
space
among
the
hills
and
we
followed
a
trail
leading
across
a
bend
through
a
handsome
hollow
behind
here
while
engaged
in
trying
to
circumvent
a
deer
we
discovered
some
indians
on
a
hill
several
hundred
yards
ahead
and
gave
them
a
shout
to
which
they
responded
by
loud
and
rapid
talking
and
vehement
gesticulation
but
made
no
stop
hurrying
up
the
mountain
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
we
passed
on
and
again
encamped
in
a
grassy
grove
the
absence
of
preuss
gave
me
great
concern
and
for
a
large
reward
derosier
volunteered
to
go
back
on
the
trail
i
directed
him
to
search
along
the
river
traveling
upward
for
the
space
of
a
day
and
a
half
at
which
time
i
expected
he
would
meet
fitzpatrick
whom
i
requested
to
aid
in
the
search
at
all
events
he
was
to
go
no
farther
but
return
to
this
camp
where
a
of
provisions
was
made
for
him
continuing
the
next
day
down
the
river
we
discovered
three
squaws
in
a
little
bottom
and
surrounded
them
before
they
could
make
their
escape
they
had
large
conical
baskets
which
they
were
engaged
in
filling
with
a
small
leafy
plant
just
now
beginning
to
bloom
and
covering
the
ground
like
a
sward
of
grass
these
did
not
make
any
lamentations
but
appeared
very
much
impressed
with
our
appearance
speaking
to
us
only
in
a
whisper
and
offering
us
smaller
baskets
of
the
plant
which
they
signified
to
us
was
good
to
eat
making
signs
also
that
it
was
to
be
cooked
by
the
fire
we
drew
out
a
little
cold
and
the
squaws
made
signs
to
us
that
the
men
had
gone
out
after
deer
and
that
we
could
have
some
by
waiting
till
they
came
in
we
observed
that
the
horses
ate
with
great
avidity
the
herb
which
they
had
been
gathering
and
here
also
for
the
first
time
we
saw
indians
eat
the
common
grass
one
of
the
squaws
pulling
several
tufts
and
eating
it
with
apparent
relish
seeing
our
surprise
she
pointed
to
the
horses
but
we
could
not
well
understand
what
she
meant
except
perhaps
that
what
was
good
for
the
one
was
good
for
the
other
we
encamped
in
the
evening
on
the
shore
of
the
river
at
a
place
where
the
associated
beauties
of
scenery
made
so
strong
an
impression
on
us
that
we
gave
it
the
name
of
the
beautiful
camp
the
undulating
river
shore
was
shaded
with
the
which
formed
a
continuous
grove
over
the
country
and
the
same
grassy
sward
extended
to
the
edge
of
the
water
and
we
made
our
fires
near
some
large
granite
masses
which
were
lying
among
the
trees
we
had
seen
several
of
the
acorn
during
the
day
and
here
there
were
two
which
were
very
large
containing
each
probably
ten
bushels
towards
evening
we
heard
a
weak
shout
among
the
hills
behind
and
had
the
pleasure
to
see
preuss
descending
towards
the
camp
like
ourselves
he
had
traveled
miles
but
had
seen
nothing
of
derosier
knowing
on
the
day
he
was
lost
that
i
was
determined
to
keep
the
river
as
much
as
possible
he
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
follow
the
trail
very
closely
but
walked
on
right
and
left
certain
to
find
it
somewhere
along
the
river
searching
places
to
obtain
good
views
of
the
country
towards
sunset
he
climbed
down
towards
the
river
to
look
for
the
camp
but
finding
no
trail
concluded
that
we
were
behind
and
walked
back
till
night
came
on
when
being
very
much
fatigued
he
collected
and
made
a
large
fire
among
the
rocks
the
next
day
it
became
more
serious
and
he
encamped
again
alone
thinking
that
we
must
have
taken
some
other
course
to
go
back
would
have
been
madness
in
his
weak
and
starved
condition
and
onward
towards
the
valley
was
his
only
hope
always
in
expectation
of
reaching
it
soon
his
principal
means
of
subsistence
were
a
few
roots
which
the
hunters
call
sweet
onions
having
very
little
taste
but
a
good
deal
of
nutriment
growing
generally
in
rocky
ground
and
requiring
a
good
deal
of
labor
to
get
as
he
had
only
a
searching
for
these
he
found
a
nest
of
big
ants
which
he
let
run
on
his
hand
and
stripped
them
off
in
his
mouth
these
had
an
agreeable
acid
taste
one
of
his
greatest
privations
was
the
want
of
tobacco
and
a
pleasant
smoke
at
evening
would
have
been
a
relief
which
only
a
voyageur
could
appreciate
he
tried
the
dried
leaves
of
the
knowing
that
those
of
other
oaks
were
sometimes
used
as
a
substitute
but
these
were
too
thick
and
would
not
do
on
the
he
made
seven
or
eight
miles
walking
slowly
along
the
river
avoiding
as
much
as
possible
to
climb
the
hills
in
little
pools
he
caught
some
of
the
smallest
kind
of
frogs
which
he
swallowed
not
so
much
in
the
gratification
of
hunger
as
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
some
strength
scattered
along
the
river
were
old
where
the
indians
had
roasted
muscles
and
acorns
but
though
he
searched
diligently
he
did
not
there
succeed
in
finding
either
he
had
collected
firewood
for
the
night
when
he
heard
at
some
distance
from
the
river
the
barking
of
what
he
thought
were
two
dogs
and
walked
in
that
direction
as
quickly
as
he
was
able
hoping
to
find
there
some
indian
hut
but
met
only
two
wolves
and
in
his
disappointment
the
gloom
of
the
forest
was
doubled
traveling
the
next
day
feebly
down
the
river
he
found
five
or
six
indians
at
the
huts
of
which
we
have
spoken
some
were
painting
themselves
black
and
others
roasting
acorns
being
only
one
man
they
did
not
run
off
but
received
him
kindly
and
gave
him
a
welcome
supply
of
roasted
acorns
he
gave
them
his
in
return
and
stretched
out
his
hand
to
one
of
the
indians
who
did
not
appear
to
comprehend
the
motion
but
jumped
back
as
if
he
thought
he
was
about
to
lay
hold
of
him
they
seemed
afraid
of
him
not
certain
as
to
what
he
was
traveling
on
he
came
to
the
place
where
we
had
found
the
squaws
here
he
found
our
fire
still
burning
and
the
tracks
of
the
horses
the
sight
gave
him
sudden
hope
and
courage
and
following
as
fast
as
he
could
joined
us
at
evening
we
continued
on
our
road
through
the
same
surpassingly
beautiful
country
entirely
unequalled
for
the
pasturage
of
stock
by
any
thing
we
had
ever
seen
our
horses
had
now
become
so
strong
that
they
were
able
to
carry
us
and
we
traveled
rapidly
over
four
miles
an
hour
four
of
us
riding
every
alternate
hour
every
few
hundred
yards
we
came
upon
a
little
band
of
deer
but
we
were
too
eager
to
reach
the
settlement
which
we
momentarily
expected
to
discover
to
halt
for
any
other
than
a
passing
shot
in
a
few
hours
we
reached
a
large
fork
the
northern
branch
of
the
river
and
equal
in
size
to
that
which
we
had
descended
together
they
formed
a
beautiful
stream
to
yards
wide
which
at
first
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
country
through
which
that
river
ran
we
took
to
be
the
sacramento
we
continued
down
the
right
bank
of
the
river
traveling
for
a
while
over
a
wooded
upland
where
we
had
the
delight
to
discover
tracks
of
cattle
to
the
southwest
was
visible
a
black
column
of
smoke
which
we
had
frequently
noticed
in
descending
arising
from
the
fires
we
had
seen
from
the
top
of
the
sierra
from
the
upland
we
descended
into
broad
groves
on
the
river
consisting
of
the
evergreen
and
a
new
species
of
a
with
a
large
tufted
top
and
three
to
six
feet
in
diameter
among
these
was
no
brushwood
and
the
grassy
surface
gave
to
it
the
appearance
of
parks
in
an
country
following
the
tracks
of
the
horses
and
cattle
in
search
of
people
we
discovered
a
small
village
of
indians
some
of
these
had
on
shirts
of
civilized
manufacture
but
were
otherwise
naked
and
we
could
understand
nothing
from
them
they
appeared
entirely
astonished
at
seeing
us
we
made
an
acorn
meal
at
noon
and
hurried
on
the
valley
being
gay
with
flowers
and
some
of
the
banks
being
absolutely
golden
with
the
californian
poppy
here
the
grass
was
smooth
and
green
and
the
groves
very
open
the
large
oaks
throwing
a
broad
shade
among
sunny
spots
shortly
afterwards
we
gave
a
shout
at
the
appearance
on
a
little
bluff
of
a
house
with
glass
windows
we
rode
up
but
to
our
disappointment
found
only
indians
there
was
no
appearance
of
cultivation
and
we
could
see
no
cattle
and
we
supposed
the
place
had
been
abandoned
we
now
pressed
on
more
eagerly
than
ever
the
river
swept
round
a
large
bend
to
the
right
the
hills
lowered
down
entirely
and
gradually
entering
a
broad
valley
we
came
unexpectedly
into
a
large
indian
village
where
the
people
looked
clean
and
wore
cotton
shirts
and
various
other
articles
of
dress
they
immediately
crowded
around
us
and
we
had
the
inexpressible
delight
to
find
one
who
spoke
a
little
indifferent
spanish
but
who
at
first
confounded
us
by
saying
there
were
no
whites
in
the
country
but
just
then
a
indian
came
up
and
made
his
salutations
in
very
spanish
in
answer
to
our
inquiries
he
informed
us
that
we
were
upon
the
de
los
the
river
of
the
americans
and
that
it
joined
the
sacramento
river
about
ten
miles
below
never
did
a
name
sound
more
sweetly
we
felt
ourselves
among
our
countrymen
for
the
name
of
in
these
distant
parts
is
applied
to
the
citizens
of
the
united
states
to
our
eager
inquiries
he
answered
i
am
a
cowherd
in
the
service
of
capt
sutter
and
the
people
of
this
work
for
him
our
evident
satisfaction
made
him
communicative
and
he
went
on
to
say
that
capt
sutter
was
a
very
rich
man
and
always
glad
to
see
his
country
people
we
asked
for
his
house
he
answered
that
it
was
just
over
the
hill
before
us
and
offered
if
we
would
wait
a
moment
to
take
his
horse
and
conduct
us
to
it
we
readily
accepted
this
civil
offer
in
a
short
distance
we
came
in
sight
of
the
fort
and
passing
on
the
way
the
house
of
a
settler
on
the
opposite
side
a
sinclair
we
forded
the
river
and
in
a
few
miles
were
met
a
short
distance
from
the
fort
by
capt
sutter
himself
he
gave
us
a
most
frank
and
cordial
reception
conducted
us
immediately
to
his
residence
and
under
his
hospitable
roof
we
had
a
night
of
rest
enjoyment
and
refreshment
which
none
but
ourselves
could
appreciate
but
the
party
left
in
the
mountains
with
fitzpatrick
were
to
be
attended
to
and
the
next
morning
supplied
with
fresh
horses
and
provisions
i
hurried
off
to
meet
them
on
the
second
day
we
met
a
few
miles
below
the
forks
of
the
rio
de
los
americanos
and
a
more
forlorn
and
pitiable
sight
than
they
presented
can
not
well
be
imagined
they
were
all
on
foot
each
man
weak
and
emaciated
leading
a
horse
or
mule
as
weak
and
emaciated
as
themselves
they
had
experienced
great
difficulty
in
descending
the
mountains
made
slippery
by
rains
and
melting
snows
and
many
horses
fell
over
precipices
and
were
killed
and
with
some
were
lost
the
they
carried
among
these
was
a
mule
with
the
plants
which
we
had
collected
since
leaving
fort
hall
along
a
line
of
miles
travel
out
of
horses
and
mules
with
which
we
commenced
crossing
the
sierra
only
reached
the
valley
of
the
sacramento
and
they
only
in
a
condition
to
be
led
along
fitzpatrick
and
his
party
traveling
more
slowly
had
been
able
to
make
some
little
exertion
at
hunting
and
had
killed
a
few
deer
the
scanty
supply
was
a
great
relief
to
them
for
several
had
been
made
sick
by
the
strange
and
unwholesome
food
which
the
preservation
of
life
compelled
them
to
use
we
stopped
and
encamped
as
soon
as
we
met
and
a
repast
of
good
beef
excellent
bread
and
delicious
salmon
which
i
had
brought
along
was
their
first
relief
from
the
sufferings
of
the
sierra
and
their
first
introduction
to
the
luxuries
of
the
sacramento
it
required
all
our
philosophy
and
forbearance
to
prevent
from
becoming
as
hurtful
to
us
now
as
had
been
before
the
next
day
march
we
encamped
at
the
junction
of
the
two
rivers
the
sacramento
and
americanos
and
thus
found
the
whole
party
in
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
sacramento
it
was
a
convenient
place
for
the
camp
and
among
other
things
was
within
reach
of
the
wood
necessary
to
make
the
which
we
should
need
on
our
long
journey
home
from
which
we
were
farther
distant
now
than
we
were
four
months
before
when
from
the
dalles
of
the
columbia
we
so
cheerfully
took
up
the
homeward
line
of
march
captain
sutter
emigrated
to
this
country
from
the
western
part
of
missouri
in
and
formed
the
first
settlement
in
the
valley
on
a
large
grant
of
land
which
he
obtained
from
the
mexican
government
he
had
at
first
some
trouble
with
the
indians
but
by
the
occasional
exercise
of
authority
he
has
succeeded
in
converting
them
into
a
peaceable
and
industrious
people
the
ditches
around
his
extensive
the
making
of
the
bricks
of
which
his
fort
is
constructed
the
ploughing
harrowing
and
other
agricultural
operations
are
entirely
the
work
of
these
indians
for
which
they
receive
a
very
moderate
compensation
principally
in
shirts
blankets
and
other
articles
of
clothing
in
the
same
manner
on
application
to
the
chief
of
a
village
he
readily
obtains
as
many
boys
and
girls
as
he
has
any
use
for
there
were
at
this
time
a
number
of
girls
at
the
fort
in
training
for
a
future
woolen
factory
but
they
were
now
all
busily
engaged
in
constantly
watering
the
gardens
which
the
unfavorable
dryness
of
the
season
rendered
necessary
the
occasional
dryness
of
some
seasons
i
understood
to
be
the
only
complaint
of
the
settlers
in
this
fertile
valley
as
it
sometimes
renders
the
crops
uncertain
sutter
was
about
making
arrangements
to
irrigate
his
lands
by
means
of
the
rio
de
los
americanos
he
had
this
year
sown
and
altogether
by
indian
labor
three
hundred
fanegas
of
wheat
a
few
years
since
the
neighboring
russian
establishment
of
ross
being
about
to
withdraw
from
the
country
sold
to
him
a
large
number
of
stock
with
agricultural
and
other
stores
with
a
number
of
pieces
of
artillery
and
other
munitions
of
war
for
these
a
regular
yearly
payment
is
made
in
grain
the
fort
is
a
quadrangular
structure
mounting
twelve
pieces
of
artillery
two
of
them
brass
and
capable
of
admitting
a
garrison
of
a
thousand
men
this
at
present
consists
of
forty
indians
in
uniform
one
of
whom
was
always
found
on
duty
at
the
gate
as
might
naturally
be
expected
the
pieces
are
not
in
very
good
order
the
whites
in
the
employment
of
capt
sutter
american
french
and
german
amount
perhaps
to
thirty
men
the
inner
wall
is
formed
into
buildings
comprising
the
common
quarters
with
blacksmith
and
other
workshops
the
with
a
large
and
other
buildings
occupying
more
the
centre
of
the
area
it
is
built
upon
a
stream
at
times
a
running
creek
communicating
with
the
rio

which
enters
the
sacramento
about
two
miles
below
the
latter
is
here
a
noble
river
about
three
hundred
yards
broad
deep
and
tranquil
with
several
fathoms
of
water
in
the
channel
and
its
banks
continuously
timbered
there
were
two
vessels
belonging
to
capt
sutter
at
anchor
near
the
landing
one
a
large
lighter
and
the
other
a
schooner
which
was
shortly
to
proceed
on
a
voyage
to
fort
vancouver
for
a
cargo
of
goods
since
his
arrival
several
other
persons
principally
americans
have
established
themselves
in
the
valley
sinclair
from
whom
i
experienced
much
kindness
during
my
stay
is
settled
a
few
miles
distant
on
the
rio
de
los
americanos
coudrois
a
gentleman
from
germany
has
established
himself
on
feather
river
and
is
associated
with
capt
sutter
in
agricultural
pursuits
among
other
improvements
they
are
about
to
introduce
the
cultivation
of
which
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
is
admirably
adapted
to
the
climate
and
soil
the
lowest
average
produce
of
wheat
as
far
as
we
can
at
present
know
is
fanegas
for
one
sown
but
as
an
instance
of
its
fertility
it
may
be
mentioned
that
señor
valejo
obtained
on
a
piece
of
ground
where
sheep
had
been
pastured
fanegas
for
eight
sown
the
produce
being
different
in
various
places
a
very
correct
idea
can
not
be
formed
an
impetus
was
given
to
the
active
little
population
by
our
arrival
as
we
were
in
want
of
every
thing
mules
horses
and
cattle
were
to
be
collected
the
was
at
work
day
and
night
to
make
sufficient
flour
the
blacksmith
shop
was
put
in
requisition
for
and
and
ropes
and
bridles
and
all
the
other
little
equipments
of
the
camp
were
again
to
be
provided
the
delay
thus
occasioned
was
one
of
repose
and
enjoyment
which
our
situation
required
and
anxious
as
we
were
to
resume
our
homeward
journey
was
regretted
by
no
one
in
the
mean
time
i
had
the
pleasure
to
meet
with
chiles
who
was
residing
at
a
farm
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
sacramento
while
engaged
in
the
selection
of
a
place
for
a
settlement
for
which
he
had
received
the
necessary
grant
of
land
from
the
mexican
government
it
will
be
remembered
that
we
had
parted
near
the
frontier
of
the
states
and
that
he
had
subsequently
descended
the
valley
of
fork
with
a
party
of
ten
or
twelve
men
with
the
intention
of
crossing
the
intermediate
mountains
to
the
waters
of
the
bay
of
san
francisco
in
the
execution
of
this
design
and
aided
by
subsequent
information
he
left
the
columbia
at
the
mouth
of
river
and
making
his
way
to
the
of
the
sacramento
with
a
part
of
his
company
traveled
down
that
river
to
the
settlements
of
nueva
helvetia
the
other
party
to
whom
he
had
committed
his
wagons
and
and
saws
took
a
course
further
to
the
south
and
the
wagons
and
their
contents
were
lost
on
the
we
made
a
preparatory
move
and
encamped
near
the
settlement
of
sinclair
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rio
de
los
americanos
i
had
discharged
five
of
the
party
neal
the
blacksmith
an
excellent
workman
and
an
unmarried
man
who
had
done
his
duty
faithfully
and
had
been
of
very
great
service
to
me
desired
to
remain
as
strong
inducements
were
offered
here
to
mechanics
although
at
considerable
inconvenience
to
myself
his
good
conduct
induced
me
to
comply
with
his
request
and
i
obtained
for
him
from
capt
sutter
a
present
compensation
of
two
dollars
and
a
half
per
diem
with
a
promise
that
it
should
be
increased
to
five
if
he
proved
as
good
a
workman
as
had
been
represented
he
was
more
particularly
an
agricultural
blacksmith
the
other
men
were
discharged
with
their
own
consent
while
we
remained
at
this
place
derosier
one
of
our
best
men
whose
steady
good
conduct
had
won
my
regard
wandered
off
from
the
camp
and
never
returned
to
it
again
nor
has
he
since
been
heard
of
we
resumed
our
journey
with
an
ample
stock
of
provisions
and
a
large
cavalcade
of
animals
consisting
of
horses
and
mules
and
about
head
of
cattle
five
of
which
were
sutter
furnished
us
also
with
an
indian
boy
who
had
been
trained
as
a
and
who
would
be
serviceable
in
managing
our
cavalcade
great
part
of
which
were
nearly
as
wild
as
buffalo
and
who
was
besides
very
anxious
to
go
along
with
us
our
direct
course
home
was
east
but
the
sierra
would
force
us
south
above
miles
of
traveling
to
a
pass
at
the
head
of
the
san
joaquin
river
this
pass
reported
to
be
good
was
discovered
by
joseph
walker
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
and
whose
name
it
might
therefore
appropriately
bear
to
reach
it
our
course
lay
along
the
valley
of
the
san
joaquin
the
river
on
our
right
and
the
lofty
wall
of
the
impassable
sierra
on
the
left
from
that
pass
we
were
to
move
southeastwardly
having
the
sierra
then
on
the
right
and
reach
the
deviously
traced
from
one
to
another
which
constituted
the
route
of
the
caravans
from
de
los
near
the
coast
of
the
pacific
to
of
new
mexico
from
the
pass
to
this
trail
was
miles
following
that
trail
through
a
desert
relieved
by
some
fertile
plains
indicated
by
the
recurrence
of
the
term
until
it
turned
to
the
right
to
cross
the
colorado
our
course
would
be
northeast
until
we
regained
the
latitude
we
had
lost
in
arriving
at
eutah
lake
and
thence
to
the
rocky
mountains
at
the
head
of
the
arkansas
this
course
of
traveling
forced
upon
us
by
the
structure
of
the
country
would
occupy
a
computed
distance
of
miles
before
we
reached
the
head
of
the
arkansas
not
a
settlement
to
be
seen
upon
it
and
the
names
of
places
along
it
all
being
spanish
or
indian
indicated
that
it
had
been
but
little
trod
by
feet
though
long
and
not
free
from
hardships
this
route
presented
some
points
of
attraction
in
tracing
the
sierra
nevada
turning
the
great
basin
perhaps
crossing
its
rim
on
the
south
completely
solving
the
problem
of
any
river
except
the
colorado
from
the
rocky
mountains
on
that
part
of
our
continent
and
seeing
the
southern
extremity
of
the
great
salt
lake
of
which
the
northern
part
had
been
examined
the
year
before
taking
leave
of
sutter
who
with
several
gentlemen
accompanied
us
a
few
miles
on
our
way
we
traveled
about
miles
and
encamped
on
the
de
los
a
stream
receiving
its
name
from
the
indians
who
live
in
its
valley
our
road
was
through
a
level
country
admirably
suited
to
cultivation
and
covered
with
groves
of
principally
the
and
a
large
oak
already
mentioned
in
form
like
those
of
the
the
weather
which
here
at
this
season
can
easily
be
changed
from
the
summer
heat
of
the
valley
to
the
frosty
mornings
and
bright
days
nearer
the
mountains
continued
delightful
for
travelers
but
unfavorable
to
the
agriculturists
whose
crops
of
wheat
began
to
wear
a
yellow
tinge
from
want
of
rain
we
traveled
for
miles
over
the
same
delightful
country
as
yesterday
and
halted
in
a
beautiful
bottom
at
the
ford
of
the
de
los
receiving
its
name
from
another
indian
tribe
living
on
the
river
the
bottoms
on
the
stream
are
broad
rich
and
extremely
fertile
and
the
uplands
are
shaded
with
oak
groves
a
showy
of
extraordinary
beauty
growing
four
to
five
feet
in
height
and
covered
with
spikes
in
bloom
adorned
the
banks
of
the
river
and
filled
the
air
with
a
light
and
grateful
perfume
on
the
we
halted
at
the
de
las
skull
creek
a
tributary
to
the
san
joaquin
the
previous
two
streams
entering
the
bay
between
the
san
joaquin
and
sacramento
rivers
this
place
is
beautiful
with
open
groves
of
oak
and
a
grassy
sward
beneath
with
many
plants
in
bloom
some
varieties
of
which
seem
to
love
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
grow
there
in
close
small
fields
near
the
river
and
replacing
the
grass
are
great
quantities
of
soap
plant
the
leaves
of
which
are
used
in
california
for
making
among
other
things
mats
for
a
vine
with
a
small
white
flower
called
here
yerba
and
which
from
its
abundance
gives
name
to
an
island
and
town
in
the
bay
was
very
frequent
on
our
road
sometimes
running
on
the
ground
or
climbing
the
trees
we
traveled
steadily
and
rapidly
up
the
valley
for
with
our
wild
animals
any
other
gait
was
impossible
and
making
about
five
miles
an
hour
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
our
ride
had
been
over
a
very
level
prairie
or
rather
a
succession
of
long
stretches
of
prairie
separated
by
lines
and
groves
of
oak
timber
growing
along
dry
gullies
which
are
filled
with
water
in
seasons
of
rain
and
perhaps
also
by
the
melting
snows
over
much
of
this
extent
the
vegetation
was
sparse
the
surface
showing
plainly
the
action
of
water
which
in
the
season
of
flood
the
joaquin
spreads
over
the
valley
about
one
we
came
again
among
innumerable
flowers
and
a
few
miles
further
fields
of
the
beautiful
which
seems
to
love
the
neighborhood
of
water
indicated
that
we
were
approaching
a
stream
we
here
found
this
beautiful
shrub
in
thickets
some
of
them
being
feet
in
height
occasionally
three
or
four
plants
were
clustered
together
forming
a
grand
bouquet
about
feet
in
circumference
and
feet
high
the
whole
summit
covered
with
spikes
of
flowers
the
perfume
of
which
is
very
sweet
and
grateful
a
lover
of
natural
beauty
can
imagine
with
what
pleasure
we
rode
among
these
flowering
groves
which
filled
the
air
with
a
light
and
delicate
fragrance
we
continued
our
road
for
about
a
half
a
mile
interspersed
through
an
open
grove
of
which
in
form
were
the
most
symmetrical
and
beautiful
we
had
yet
seen
in
this
country
the
ends
of
their
branches
rested
on
the
ground
forming
somewhat
more
than
a
half
sphere
of
very
full
and
regular
figure
with
leaves
apparently
smaller
than
usual
the
californian
poppy
of
a
rich
orange
color
was
numerous
elk
and
several
bands
of
antelope
made
their
appearance
our
road
was
now
one
continued
enjoyment
and
it
was
pleasant
riding
among
this
assemblage
of
green
pastures
with
varied
flowers
and
scattered
groves
and
out
of
the
warm
green
spring
to
look
at
the
rocky
and
snowy
peaks
where
lately
we
had
suffered
so
much
emerging
from
the
timber
we
came
suddenly
upon
the
stanislaus
river
where
we
hoped
to
find
a
ford
but
the
stream
was
flowing
by
dark
and
deep
swollen
by
the
mountain
snows
its
general
breadth
was
about
yards
we
traveled
about
five
miles
up
the
river
and
encamped
without
being
able
to
find
a
ford
here
we
made
a
large
in
order
to
be
able
to
catch
a
sufficient
number
of
our
wild
animals
to
relieve
those
previously
packed
under
the
shade
of
the
oaks
along
the
river
i
noticed
in
bloom
eight
or
ten
inches
high
this
is
the
plant
which
we
had
seen
the
squaws
gathering
on
the
rio
de
los
americanos
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
it
is
highly
esteemed
for
fattening
cattle
which
appear
to
be
very
fond
of
it
here
where
the
soil
begins
to
be
sandy
it
supplies
to
a
considerable
extent
the
want
of
grass
desirous
as
far
as
possible
without
delay
to
include
in
our
examination
the
san
joaquin
river
i
returned
this
morning
down
the
stanislaus
for
miles
and
again
encamped
without
having
found
a
after
following
it
for
eight
miles
further
the
next
morning
and
finding
ourselves
in
the
vicinity
of
the
san
joaquin
encamped
in
a
handsome
oak
grove
and
several
cattle
being
killed
we
ferried
over
our
baggage
in
their
skins
here
our
indian
boy
who
probably
had
not
much
idea
of
where
he
was
going
and
began
to
be
alarmed
at
the
many
streams
which
we
were
rapidly
putting
between
him
and
the
village
deserted
thirteen
head
of
cattle
took
a
sudden
fright
while
we
were
driving
them
across
the
river
and
galloped
off
i
remained
a
day
in
the
endeavor
to
recover
them
but
finding
they
had
taken
the
trail
back
to
the
fort
let
them
go
without
further
effort
here
we
had
several
days
of
warm
and
pleasant
rain
which
doubtless
saved
the
crops
below
april
on
the
of
april
we
made
miles
across
a
prairie
without
timber
when
we
were
stopped
again
by
another
large
river
which
is
called
the
de
la
river
of
our
lady
of
mercy
here
the
country
had
lost
its
character
of
extreme
fertility
the
soil
having
become
more
sandy
and
light
but
for
several
days
past
its
beauty
had
been
increased
by
the
additional
animation
of
animal
life
and
now
it
is
crowded
with
bands
of
elk
and
wild
horses
and
along
the
rivers
are
frequent
fresh
tracks
of
grizzly
bear
which
are
unusually
numerous
in
this
country
our
route
had
been
along
the
timber
of
the
san
joaquin
generally
about
eight
miles
distant
over
a
high
prairie
in
one
of
the
bands
of
elk
seen
there
were
about
but
the
larger
bands
both
of
these
and
wild
horses
are
generally
found
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
which
for
that
reason
i
avoided
crossing
i
had
been
informed
below
that
the
droves
of
wild
horses
were
almost
invariably
found
on
the
western
bank
of
the
river
and
the
danger
of
losing
our
animals
among
them
together
with
the
wish
of
adding
to
our
reconnoissance
the
numerous
streams
which
run
down
from
the
sierra
decided
me
to
travel
up
the
eastern
bank
the
day
was
occupied
in
building
a
boat
and
ferrying
our
baggage
across
the
river
and
we
encamped
on
the
bank
a
large
fishing
eagle
was
slowly
sailing
along
looking
after
salmon
and
there
were
some
pretty
birds
in
the
timber
with
partridges
ducks
and
geese
innumerable
in
the
neighborhood
we
were
struck
with
the
tameness
of
the
latter
bird
at
helvetia
scattered
about
in
flocks
near
the
and
eating
grass
on
the
prairie
a
horseman
would
ride
by
within
yards
without
disturbing
them
we
touched
several
times
the
san
joaquin
river
here
a
tranquil
stream
with
a
slight
current
and
apparently
deep
it
resembled
the
missouri
in
color
with
occasional
points
of
white
sand
and
its
banks
where
steep
were
a
kind
of
sandy
clay
its
average
width
appeared
to
be
about
eighty
yards
in
the
bottoms
are
frequent
ponds
where
our
approach
disturbed
multitudes
of
wild
fowl
principally
geese
skirting
along
the
timber
we
frequently
started
elk
and
large
bands
were
seen
during
the
day
with
antelope
and
wild
horses
the
low
country
and
the
timber
rendered
it
difficult
to
keep
the
main
line
of
the
river
and
this
evening
we
encamped
on
a
tributary
stream
about
five
miles
from
its
mouth
on
the
prairie
bordering
the
san
joaquin
bottoms
there
occurred
during
the
day
but
little
grass
and
in
its
place
was
a
sparse
and
dwarf
growth
of
plants
the
soil
being
sandy
with
small
bare
places
and
hillocks
reminded
me
much
of
the
platte
bottoms
but
on
approaching
the
timber
we
found
a
more
luxuriant
vegetation
and
at
our
camp
was
an
abundance
of
grass
and
the
foliage
of
the
oak
is
getting
darker
and
every
thing
except
that
the
weather
is
a
little
cool
shows
that
spring
is
rapidly
advancing
and
we
had
quite
a
summer
rain
commenced
to
rain
at
daylight
but
cleared
off
brightly
at
sunrise
we
ferried
the
river
without
any
difficulty
and
continued
up
the
san
joaquin
elk
were
running
in
bands
over
the
prairie
and
in
the
skirt
of
the
timber
we
reached
the
river
at
the
mouth
of
a
large
slough
which
we
were
unable
to
ford
and
made
a
circuit
of
several
miles
around
here
the
country
appears
very
flat
have
entirely
disappeared
and
are
replaced
by
a
large
willow
nearly
equal
to
it
in
size
the
river
is
about
a
hundred
yards
in
breadth
branching
into
sloughs
and
interspersed
with
islands
at
this
time
it
appears
sufficiently
deep
for
a
small
steamer
but
its
navigation
would
be
broken
by
shallows
at
low
water
bearing
in
towards
the
river
we
were
again
forced
off
by
another
slough
and
passing
around
steered
towards
a
clump
of
trees
on
the
river
and
finding
there
good
grass
encamped
the
prairies
along
the
left
bank
are
alive
with
immense
droves
of
wild
horses
and
they
had
been
seen
during
the
day
at
every
opening
through
the
woods
which
afforded
us
a
view
across
the
river
latitude
by
observation
longitude
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
ride
the
country
presented
a
lacustrine
appearance
the
river
was
deep
and
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
surrounding
country
its
banks
raised
like
a
levee
and
fringed
with
willows
over
the
bordering
plain
were
interspersed
spots
of
prairie
among
fields
of
bulrushes
which
in
this
country
are
called
and
little
ponds
on
the
opposite
side
a
line
of
timber
was
visible
which
according
to
information
points
out
the
course
of
the
slough
which
at
times
of
high
water
connects
with
the
san
joaquin
river
a
large
body
of
water
in
the
upper
part
of
the
valley
called
the
tule
lakes
the
river
and
all
its
sloughs
are
very
full
and
it
is
probable
that
the
lake
is
now
discharging
here
elk
were
frequently
started
and
one
was
shot
out
of
a
band
which
ran
around
us
on
our
left
the
sierra
maintains
its
snowy
height
and
masses
of
snow
appear
to
descend
very
low
towards
the
plains
probably
the
late
rains
in
the
valley
were
snow
on
the
mountains
we
traveled
miles
and
encamped
on
the
river
longitude
of
the
camp
and
latitude
after
having
traveled
fifteen
miles
along
the
river
we
made
an
early
halt
under
the
shade
of
here
we
found
the
san
joaquin
coming
down
from
the
sierra
with
a
westerly
course
and
checking
our
way
as
all
its
tributaries
had
previously
done
we
had
expected
to
raft
the
river
but
found
a
good
ford
and
encamped
on
the
opposite
bank
where
droves
of
wild
horses
were
raising
clouds
of
dust
on
the
prairie
columns
of
smoke
were
visible
in
the
direction
of
the
tule
lakes
to
the
southward
probably
kindled
in
the
tulares
by
the
indians
as
signals
that
there
were
strangers
in
the
valley
we
made
on
the
a
hard
march
in
a
cold
chilly
rain
from
morning
until
night
the
weather
so
thick
that
we
traveled
by
compass
this
was
a
from
the
san
joaquin
to
the
waters
of
the
tule
lakes
and
our
road
was
over
a
very
level
prairie
country
we
saw
wolves
frequently
during
the
day
prowling
about
after
the
young
antelope
which
can
not
run
very
fast
these
were
numerous
during
the
day
and
two
were
caught
by
the
people
late
in
the
afternoon
we
discovered
timber
which
was
found
to
be
groves
of
on
a
dry
the
rain
which
had
fallen
in
frequent
showers
poured
down
in
a
storm
at
sunset
with
a
strong
wind
which
swept
off
the
clouds
and
left
a
clear
sky
riding
on
through
the
timber
about
dark
we
found
abundant
water
in
small
ponds
to
yards
in
diameter
with
clear
deep
water
and
sandy
beds
bordered
with
bog
rushes
and
a
tall
rush
twelve
feet
high
and
surrounded
near
the
margin
with
in
bloom
among
them
one
which
resembled
the
oak
of
the
groves
was
the
same
already
mentioned
with
small
leaves
in
form
like
those
of
the
and
forming
with
the
the
characteristic
trees
of
the
valley
after
a
ride
of
two
miles
through
brush
and
open
groves
we
reached
a
large
stream
called
the
river
of
the
lake
resembling
in
size
the
san
joaquin
and
being
about
yards
broad
this
is
the
principal
tributary
to
the
tule
lakes
which
collect
all
the
waters
in
the
upper
part
of
the
valley
while
we
were
searching
for
a
ford
some
indians
appeared
on
the
opposite
bank
and
having
discovered
that
we
were
not
spanish
soldiers
showed
us
the
way
to
a
good
ford
several
miles
above
the
indians
of
the
sierra
make
frequent
descents
upon
the
settlements
west
of
the
coast
range
which
they
keep
constantly
swept
of
horses
among
them
are
many
who
are
called
christian
indians
being
refugees
from
spanish
missions
several
of
these
incursions
occurred
while
we
were
at
helvetia
occasionally
parties
of
soldiers
follow
them
across
the
coast
range
but
never
enter
the
sierra
on
the
opposite
side
we
found
some
forty
or
fifty
indians
who
had
come
to
meet
us
from
the
village
below
we
made
them
some
small
presents
and
invited
them
to
our
encampment
which
after
about
three
miles
through
fine
oak
groves
we
made
on
the
river
we
made
a
fort
principally
on
account
of
our
animals
the
indians
brought
and
several
kinds
of
fish
and
bread
made
of
acorns
to
trade
among
them
were
several
who
had
come
to
live
among
these
indians
when
the
missions
were
broken
up
and
who
spoke
spanish
fluently
they
informed
us
that
they
were
called
by
the
spaniards
tame
in
distinction
from
the
wilder
tribes
of
the
mountains
they
however
think
themselves
very
insecure
not
knowing
at
what
unforeseen
moment
the
sins
of
the
latter
may
be
visited
upon
them
they
are
but
handsome
and
intelligent
indians
and
live
principally
on
acorns
and
the
roots
of
the
tule
of
which
also
their
huts
are
made
by
observation
the
latitude
of
the
encampment
is
and
longitude
for
several
miles
we
had
very
bad
traveling
over
what
is
called
rotten
ground
in
which
the
horses
were
frequently
up
to
their
knees
making
towards
a
line
of
timber
we
found
a
small
fordable
stream
beyond
which
the
country
improved
and
the
grass
became
excellent
and
crossing
a
number
of
dry
and
timbered
we
traveled
until
late
through
open
oak
groves
and
encamped
among
a
collection
of
streams
these
were
running
among
rushes
and
willows
and
as
usual
flocks
of
blackbirds
announced
our
approach
to
water
we
have
here
approached
considerably
nearer
to
the
eastern
sierra
which
shows
very
plainly
still
covered
with
masses
of
snow
which
yesterday
and
has
also
appeared
abundant
on
the
coast
range
we
made
another
long
journey
of
about
forty
miles
through
a
country
uninteresting
and
flat
with
very
little
grass
and
a
sandy
soil
in
which
several
branches
we
crossed
had
lost
their
water
in
the
evening
the
face
of
the
country
became
hilly
and
turning
a
few
miles
up
towards
the
mountains
we
found
a
good
encampment
on
a
pretty
stream
hidden
among
the
hills
and
handsomely
timbered
principally
with
large
cottonwoods
differing
from
any
in
sylva
the
of
this
tree
were
now
just
about
bursting
several
indians
came
down
the
river
to
see
us
in
the
evening
we
gave
them
supper
and
cautioned
them
against
stealing
our
horses
which
they
promised
not
to
attempt
a
broad
trail
along
the
river
here
takes
out
among
the
hills
buen
camino
good
road
said
one
of
the
indians
of
whom
we
had
inquired
about
the
pass
and
following
it
accordingly
it
conducted
us
beautifully
through
a
very
broken
country
by
an
excellent
way
which
otherwise
we
should
have
found
extremely
bad
taken
separately
the
hills
present
smooth
and
graceful
outlines
but
together
make
bad
traveling
ground
instead
of
grass
the
whole
face
of
the
country
is
closely
covered
with
here
only
two
or
three
inches
high
its
height
and
beauty
varied
in
a
remarkable
manner
with
the
locality
being
in
many
low
places
which
we
passed
during
the
day
around
streams
and
springs
two
and
three
feet
high
the
country
had
now
assumed
a
character
of
aridity
and
the
luxuriant
green
of
these
little
streams
wooded
with
willow
oak
or
sycamore
looked
very
refreshing
among
the
sandy
hills
in
the
evening
we
encamped
on
a
large
creek
with
abundant
water
i
noticed
here
in
bloom
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
the
arkansas
waters
the
along
our
road
the
country
was
altogether
sandy
and
vegetation
meager
which
we
had
first
seen
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
pyramid
lake
made
its
appearance
here
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
became
very
abundant
and
in
large
bushes
towards
the
close
of
the
afternoon
we
reached
a
tolerably
large
river
which
empties
into
a
small
lake
at
the
head
of
the
valley
it
is
about
yards
wide
with
a
stony
and
gravelly
bed
and
the
swiftest
stream
we
have
crossed
since
leaving
the
bay
the
bottoms
produced
no
grass
though
well
timbered
with
willow
and
cottonwood
and
after
ascending
several
miles
we
made
a
late
encampment
on
a
little
bottom
with
scanty
grass
in
greater
part
the
vegetation
along
our
road
consisted
now
of
rare
and
unusual
plants
among
which
many
were
entirely
new
along
the
bottoms
were
thickets
consisting
of
several
varieties
of
shrubs
which
made
here
their
first
appearance
and
among
these
was
lindley
a
small
tree
belonging
to
a
very
peculiar
natural
order
and
in
its
general
appearance
growing
in
thickets
resembling
willow
it
now
became
common
along
the
streams
frequently
supplying
the
place
of
the
water
was
low
and
a
few
miles
above
we
forded
the
river
at
a
rapid
and
marched
in
a
southeasterly
direction
over
a
less
broken
country
the
mountains
were
now
very
near
occasionally
looming
out
through
fog
in
a
few
hours
we
reached
the
bottom
of
a
creek
without
water
over
which
the
sandy
beds
were
dispersed
in
many
branches
immediately
where
we
struck
it
the
timber
terminated
and
below
to
the
right
it
was
a
broad
bed
of
dry
and
bare
sands
there
were
many
tracks
of
indians
and
horses
imprinted
in
the
sand
which
with
other
indications
informed
us
was
the
creek
issuing
from
the
pass
and
which
we
have
called
pass
creek
we
ascended
a
trail
for
a
few
miles
along
the
creek
and
suddenly
found
a
stream
of
water
five
feet
wide
running
with
a
lively
current
but
losing
itself
almost
immediately
this
little
stream
showed
plainly
the
manner
in
which
the
mountain
waters
lose
themselves
in
sand
at
the
eastern
foot
of
the
sierra
leaving
only
a
parched
desert
and
arid
plains
beyond
the
stream
enlarged
rapidly
and
the
timber
became
abundant
as
we
ascended
a
new
species
of
pine
made
its
appearance
with
several
kinds
of
oaks
and
a
variety
of
trees
and
the
country
changing
its
appearance
suddenly
and
entirely
we
found
ourselves
again
traveling
among
the
old
places
here
we
selected
a
delightful
encampment
in
a
handsome
green
oak
hollow
where
among
the
open
bolls
of
the
trees
was
an
abundant
sward
of
grass
and
in
the
evening
a
christian
indian
rode
into
the
camp
well
dressed
with
long
spurs
and
a
and
speaking
spanish
fluently
it
was
an
unexpected
apparition
and
a
strange
and
pleasant
sight
in
this
desolate
gorge
of
a
mountain
an
indian
face
spanish
costume
jingling
spurs
and
horse
equipped
after
the
spanish
manner
he
informed
me
that
he
belonged
to
one
of
the
spanish
missions
to
the
south
distant
two
or
three
ride
and
that
he
had
obtained
from
the
priests
leave
to
spend
a
few
days
with
his
relations
in
the
sierra
having
seen
us
enter
the
pass
he
had
come
down
to
visit
us
he
appeared
familiarly
acquainted
with
the
country
and
gave
me
definite
and
clear
information
in
regard
to
the
desert
region
east
of
the
mountains
i
had
entered
the
pass
with
a
strong
disposition
to
vary
my
route
and
to
travel
directly
across
towards
the
great
salt
lake
in
the
view
of
obtaining
some
acquaintance
with
the
interior
of
the
great
basin
while
pursuing
a
direct
course
for
the
frontier
but
his
representation
which
described
it
as
an
arid
and
barren
desert
that
had
repulsed
by
its
sterility
all
the
attempts
of
the
indians
to
penetrate
it
determined
me
for
the
present
to
relinquish
the
plan
and
agreeably
to
his
advice
after
crossing
the
sierra
continue
our
intended
route
along
its
eastern
base
to
the
spanish
trail
by
this
route
a
party
of
six
indians
who
had
come
from
a
great
river
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
desert
to
trade
with
his
people
had
just
started
on
their
return
he
would
himself
return
the
next
day
to
and
as
our
roads
would
be
the
same
for
two
days
he
offered
his
services
to
conduct
us
so
far
on
our
way
his
offer
was
gladly
accepted
the
fog
which
had
somewhat
interfered
with
views
in
the
valley
had
entirely
passed
off
and
left
a
clear
sky
that
which
had
enveloped
us
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
pass
proceeded
evidently
from
fires
kindled
among
the
tulares
by
indians
living
near
the
lakes
and
which
were
intended
to
warn
those
in
the
mountains
that
there
were
strangers
in
the
valley
our
position
was
in
latitude
and
longitude
our
guide
joined
us
this
morning
on
the
trail
and
arriving
in
a
short
distance
at
an
open
bottom
where
the
creek
forked
we
continued
up
the
branch
which
was
enriched
by
a
profusion
of
flowers
and
handsomely
wooded
with
sycamore
oaks
cottonwood
and
willow
with
other
trees
and
some
shrubby
plants
in
its
long
strings
of
balls
this
sycamore
differs
from
that
of
the
united
states
and
is
the
of
hooker
a
new
species
recently
described
among
the
plants
collected
in
the
voyage
of
the
sulphur
the
cottonwood
varied
its
foliage
with
white
tufts
and
the
feathery
seeds
were
flying
plentifully
through
the
air
gooseberries
nearly
ripe
were
very
abundant
in
the
mountains
and
as
we
passed
the
dividing
grounds
which
were
not
very
easy
to
ascertain
the
air
was
filled
with
perfume
as
if
we
were
entering
a
highly
cultivated
garden
and
instead
of
green
our
pathway
and
the
mountain
sides
were
covered
with
fields
of
yellow
flowers
which
here
was
the
prevailing
color
our
journey
was
in
the
midst
of
an
advanced
spring
whose
green
and
floral
beauty
offered
a
delightful
contrast
to
the
sandy
valley
we
had
just
left
all
the
day
snow
was
in
sight
on
the
butte
of
the
mountain
which
frowned
down
upon
us
on
the
right
but
we
beheld
it
now
with
feelings
of
pleasant
security
as
we
rode
along
between
green
trees
and
on
flowers
with
hummingbirds
and
other
feathered
friends
of
the
traveler
enlivening
the
serene
spring
air
as
we
reached
the
summit
of
this
beautiful
pass
and
obtained
a
view
into
the
eastern
country
we
saw
at
once
that
here
was
the
place
to
take
leave
of
all
such
pleasant
scenes
as
those
around
us
the
distant
mountains
were
now
bald
rocks
again
and
below
the
land
had
any
color
but
green
taking
into
consideration
the
nature
of
the
sierra
nevada
we
found
this
pass
an
excellent
one
for
horses
and
with
a
little
labor
or
perhaps
with
a
more
perfect
examination
of
the
localities
it
might
be
made
sufficiently
practicable
for
wagons
its
latitude
and
longitude
may
be
considered
that
of
our
last
encampment
only
a
few
miles
distant
the
elevation
was
not
taken
our
cavalcade
making
it
troublesome
to
halt
before
night
when
once
started
we
here
left
the
waters
of
the
bay
of
san
francisco
and
though
forced
upon
them
contrary
to
my
intentions
i
can
not
regret
the
necessity
which
occasioned
the
deviation
it
made
me
well
acquainted
with
the
great
range
of
the
sierra
nevada
of
the
alta
california
and
showed
that
this
broad
and
elevated
snowy
ridge
was
a
continuation
of
the
cascade
range
of
oregon
between
which
and
the
ocean
there
is
still
another
and
a
lower
range
parallel
to
the
former
and
to
the
coast
and
which
may
be
called
the
coast
range
it
also
made
me
well
acquainted
with
the
basin
of
the
san
francisco
bay
and
with
the
two
pretty
rivers
and
their
valleys
the
sacramento
and
san
joaquin
which
are
tributary
to
that
bay
and
cleared
up
some
points
in
geography
on
which
error
had
long
prevailed
it
had
been
constantly
represented
as
i
have
already
stated
that
the
bay
of
san
francisco
opened
far
into
the
interior
by
some
river
coming
down
from
the
base
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
upon
which
supposed
stream
the
name
of
rio
buenaventura
had
been
bestowed
our
observations
of
the
sierra
nevada
in
the
long
distance
from
the
head
of
the
sacramento
to
the
head
of
the
san
joaquin
and
of
the
valley
below
it
which
collects
all
the
waters
of
the
san
francisco
bay
show
that
this
neither
is
nor
can
be
the
case
no
river
from
the
interior
does
or
can
cross
the
sierra
nevada
itself
more
lofty
than
the
rocky
mountains
and
as
to
the
buenaventura
the
mouth
of
which
seen
on
the
coast
gave
the
idea
and
the
name
of
the
reputed
great
river
it
is
in
fact
a
small
stream
of
no
consequence
not
only
below
the
sierra
nevada
but
actually
below
the
coast
range
taking
its
rise
within
half
a
degree
of
the
ocean
running
parallel
to
it
for
about
two
degrees
and
then
falling
into
the
pacific
near
monterey
there
is
no
opening
from
the
bay
of
san
francisco
into
the
interior
of
the
continent
the
two
rivers
which
flow
into
it
are
comparatively
short
and
not
perpendicular
to
the
coast
but
lateral
to
it
and
having
their
heads
towards
oregon
and
southern
california
they
open
lines
of
communication
north
and
south
and
not
eastwardly
and
thus
this
want
of
interior
communication
from
the
san
francisco
bay
now
fully
ascertained
gives
great
additional
value
to
the
columbia
which
stands
alone
as
the
only
great
river
on
the
pacific
slope
of
our
continent
which
leads
from
the
ocean
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
opens
a
line
of
communication
from
the
sea
to
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
four
joined
our
guide
at
the
pass
and
two
going
back
at
noon
the
others
continued
on
in
company
descending
from
the
hills
we
reached
a
country
of
fine
grass
where
the
finally
disappeared
giving
place
to
an
excellent
quality
of
passing
by
some
springs
where
there
was
a
rich
sward
of
grass
among
groves
of
large
we
rode
over
a
plain
on
which
the
guide
pointed
out
a
spot
where
a
refugee
christian
indian
had
been
killed
by
a
party
of
soldiers
which
had
unexpectedly
penetrated
into
the
mountains
crossing
a
low
sierra
and
descending
a
hollow
where
a
spring
gushed
out
we
were
struck
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
trees
which
gave
a
strange
and
southern
character
to
the
country
and
suited
well
with
the
dry
and
desert
region
we
were
approaching
associated
with
the
idea
of
barren
sands
their
stiff
and
ungraceful
form
makes
them
to
the
traveler
the
most
repulsive
tree
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
following
the
hollow
we
shortly
came
upon
a
creek
timbered
with
large
which
yet
had
not
put
forth
a
leaf
there
was
a
small
rivulet
of
running
water
with
good
grass
the
indians
who
had
accompanied
the
guide
returned
this
morning
and
i
purchased
from
them
a
spanish
saddle
and
long
spurs
as
reminiscences
of
the
time
and
for
a
few
yards
of
scarlet
cloth
they
gave
me
a
horse
which
afterwards
became
food
for
other
indians
we
continued
a
short
distance
down
the
creek
in
which
our
guide
informed
us
that
the
water
very
soon
disappeared
and
turned
directly
to
the
southward
along
the
foot
of
the
mountain
the
trail
on
which
we
rode
appearing
to
describe
the
eastern
limit
of
travel
where
water
and
grass
terminated
crossing
a
low
spur
which
bordered
the
creek
we
descended
to
a
kind
of
plain
among
the
lower
spurs
the
desert
being
in
full
view
on
our
left
apparently
illimitable
a
hot
mist
lay
over
it
through
which
it
had
a
white
and
glistening
appearance
here
and
there
a
few
and
isolated
black
ridges
rose
suddenly
upon
it
there
said
our
guide
stretching
out
his
hand
towards
it
there
are
the
great
plains
hay
agua
no
hay
zacate
there
is
neither
water
nor
grass
nothing
every
animal
that
goes
upon
them
dies
it
was
indeed
dismal
to
look
upon
and
to
conceive
so
great
a
change
in
so
short
a
distance
one
might
travel
the
world
over
without
finding
a
valley
more
fresh
and
verdant
more
floral
and
sylvan
more
alive
with
birds
and
animals
more
bounteously
watered
than
we
had
left
in
the
san
joaquin
here
within
a
few
miles
ride
a
vast
desert
plain
spread
before
us
from
which
the
boldest
traveler
turned
away
in
despair
directly
in
front
of
us
at
some
distance
to
the
southward
and
running
out
in
an
easterly
direction
from
the
mountains
stretched
a
sierra
having
at
the
eastern
end
perhaps
miles
distant
some
snowy
peaks
on
which
by
the
information
of
our
guide
snow
rested
all
the
year
our
cavalcade
made
a
strange
and
grotesque
appearance
and
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
reflecting
upon
our
position
and
composition
in
this
remote
solitude
within
two
degrees
of
the
pacific
ocean
already
far
south
of
the
latitude
of
monterey
and
still
forced
on
south
by
a
desert
on
one
hand
and
a
mountain
range
on
the
other
guided
by
a
civilized
indian
attended
by
two
wild
ones
from
the
sierra
a
chinook
from
the
columbia
and
our
mixture
of
american
french
german
all
armed
four
or
five
languages
heard
at
once
above
a
hundred
horses
and
mules
half
wild
american
spanish
and
indian
dresses
and
equipments
intermingled
such
was
our
composition
our
march
was
a
sort
of
procession
scouts
ahead
and
on
the
flanks
a
front
and
rear
division
the
baggage
and
in
the
centre
and
the
whole
stretching
a
quarter
of
a
mile
along
our
dreary
path
in
this
form
we
journeyed
looking
more
as
if
we
belonged
to
asia
than
to
the
united
states
of
america
we
continued
in
a
southerly
direction
across
the
plain
to
which
as
well
as
to
all
the
country
so
far
as
we
could
see
the
trees
gave
a
strange
and
singular
character
several
new
plants
appeared
among
which
was
a
zygophyllaceous
shrub
torr
and
sometimes
ten
feet
in
height
in
form
and
in
the
pliancy
of
its
branches
it
is
rather
a
graceful
plant
its
leaves
are
small
covered
with
a
resinous
substance
and
particularly
when
bruised
and
crushed
exhale
a
singular
but
very
agreeable
and
refreshing
odor
this
shrub
and
the
with
many
varieties
of
cactus
make
the
characteristic
features
in
the
vegetation
for
a
long
distance
to
the
eastward
along
the
foot
of
the
mountain
miles
to
the
southward
red
stripes
of
flowers
were
visible
during
the
morning
which
we
supposed
to
be
variegated
sandstones
we
rode
rapidly
during
the
day
and
in
the
afternoon
emerged
from
the
forest
at
the
foot
of
an
of
the
sierra
before
us
and
came
among
the
fields
of
flowers
we
had
seen
in
the
morning
which
consisted
principally
of
the
rich
california
poppy
mingled
with
other
flowers
of
brighter
tints
reaching
the
top
of
the
spur
which
was
covered
with
fine
and
where
the
hills
were
very
green
our
guide
pointed
to
a
small
hollow
in
the
mountain
before
us
saying
este
piedra
hay
he
appeared
to
know
every
nook
in
the
country
we
continued
our
beautiful
road
and
reached
a
spring
in
the
slope
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
running
in
a
green
ravine
among
granite
boulders
here
nightshade
and
borders
of
buckwheat
with
their
white
blossoms
around
the
granite
rocks
attracted
our
notice
as
familiar
plants
several
antelopes
were
seen
among
the
hills
and
some
large
hares
men
were
sent
back
this
evening
in
search
of
a
wild
mule
with
a
valuable
pack
which
had
managed
as
they
frequently
do
to
hide
itself
along
the
road
by
observation
the
latitude
of
the
camp
is
and
longitude
the
next
day
the
men
returned
with
the
mule
crossing
the
ridge
by
a
beautiful
pass
of
hollows
where
several
deer
broke
out
of
the
thickets
we
emerged
at
a
small
salt
lake
in
a
lying
nearly
east
and
west
where
a
trail
from
the
mission
of
comes
in
the
lake
is
about
yards
in
diameter
surrounded
on
the
margin
by
a
white
salty
border
which
by
the
smell
reminded
us
slightly
of
lake
abert
there
are
some
cottonwoods
with
willow
and
elder
around
the
lake
and
the
water
is
a
little
salt
although
not
entirely
unfit
for
drinking
here
we
turned
directly
to
the
eastward
along
the
trail
which
from
being
seldom
used
is
almost
imperceptible
and
after
traveling
a
few
miles
our
guide
halted
and
pointing
to
the
hardly
visible
trail
es
said
he
se
pierde
va
he
pointed
out
a
black
on
the
plain
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
where
we
would
find
water
to
encamp
at
night
and
giving
him
a
present
of
knives
and
scarlet
cloth
we
shook
hands
and
parted
he
bore
off
south
and
in
a
day
ride
would
arrive
at
san
fernando
one
of
several
missions
in
this
part
of
california
where
the
country
is
so
beautiful
that
it
is
considered
a
paradise
and
the
name
of
its
principal
town
de
los
would
make
it
angelic
we
continued
on
through
a
succession
of
valleys
and
came
into
a
most
beautiful
spot
of
flower
fields
instead
of
green
the
hills
were
purple
and
orange
with
unbroken
beds
into
which
each
color
was
separately
gathered
a
pale
with
a
bright
yellow
the
rich
red
orange
of
the
poppy
mingled
with
fields
of
purple
covered
the
spot
with
a
floral
beauty
and
on
the
border
of
the
sandy
deserts
seemed
to
invite
the
traveler
to
go
no
farther
riding
along
through
the
perfumed
air
we
soon
after
entered
a
defile
overgrown
with
the
ominous
which
conducted
us
into
a
sandy
plain
covered
more
or
less
densely
with
forests
of
having
now
the
snowy
ridge
on
our
right
we
continued
our
way
towards
a
dark
belonging
to
a
low
sierra
on
the
plain
and
which
our
guide
had
pointed
out
for
a
landmark
late
in
the
day
the
familiar
growth
of
cottonwood
a
line
of
which
was
visible
ahead
indicated
our
approach
to
a
creek
which
we
reached
where
the
water
spread
out
into
sands
and
a
little
below
sank
entirely
here
our
guide
had
intended
we
should
pass
the
night
but
there
was
not
a
blade
of
grass
and
hoping
to
find
nearer
the
mountain
a
little
for
the
night
we
turned
up
the
stream
a
hundred
yards
above
we
found
the
creek
a
fine
stream
sixteen
feet
wide
with
a
swift
current
a
dark
night
overtook
us
when
we
reached
the
hills
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
and
we
were
obliged
to
encamp
without
grass
tying
up
what
animals
we
could
secure
in
the
darkness
the
greater
part
of
the
wild
ones
having
free
range
for
the
night
here
the
stream
was
two
feet
deep
swift
and
clear
issuing
from
a
neighboring
snow
peak
a
few
miles
before
reaching
this
creek
we
had
crossed
a
broad
dry
riverbed
which
nearer
the
hills
the
hunters
had
found
a
bold
and
handsome
stream
some
parties
were
engaged
in
hunting
up
the
scattered
horses
and
others
in
searching
for
grass
above
both
were
successful
and
late
in
the
day
we
encamped
among
some
of
the
river
in
a
hollow
which
was
covered
with
only
tolerably
good
grasses
the
lower
ground
being
entirely
overgrown
with
large
bunches
of
the
coarse
stiff
grass
our
latitude
by
observation
was
and
longitude
traveling
close
along
the
mountain
we
followed
up
in
the
afternoon
of
the
another
stream
in
hopes
to
find
a
like
that
of
the
previous
day
but
were
deceived
except
some
scattered
there
was
nothing
but
rock
and
sand
and
even
the
fertility
of
the
mountain
seemed
withered
by
the
air
of
the
desert
among
the
few
trees
was
the
nut
pine
our
road
the
next
day
was
still
in
an
easterly
direction
along
the
ridge
over
very
bad
traveling
ground
broken
and
confounded
with
crippled
trees
and
shrubs
and
after
a
difficult
march
of
eighteen
miles
a
general
shout
announced
that
we
had
struck
the
great
object
of
our
search
the
spanish
trail
which
here
was
running
directly
north
the
road
itself
and
its
course
were
equally
happy
discoveries
to
us
since
the
middle
of
december
we
had
continually
been
forced
south
by
mountains
and
by
deserts
and
now
would
have
to
make
six
degrees
of
to
regain
the
latitude
on
which
we
wished
to
cross
the
rocky
mountains
the
course
of
the
road
therefore
was
what
we
wanted
and
once
more
we
felt
like
going
homewards
a
to
travel
on
and
the
course
to
go
were
joyful
consolations
to
us
and
our
animals
enjoyed
the
beaten
track
like
ourselves
relieved
from
the
rocks
and
brush
our
wild
mules
started
off
at
a
rapid
rate
and
in
fifteen
miles
we
reached
a
considerable
river
timbered
with
cottonwood
and
willow
where
we
found
a
bottom
of
tolerable
grass
as
the
animals
had
suffered
a
great
deal
in
the
last
few
days
i
remained
here
all
next
day
to
allow
them
the
necessary
repose
and
it
was
now
necessary
at
every
favorable
place
to
make
a
little
halt
between
us
and
the
colorado
river
we
were
aware
that
the
country
was
extremely
poor
in
grass
and
scarce
for
water
there
being
many
journey
or
long
stretches
of
forty
to
sixty
miles
without
water
where
the
road
was
marked
by
bones
of
animals
although
in
california
we
had
met
with
people
who
had
passed
over
this
trail
we
had
been
able
to
obtain
no
correct
information
about
it
and
the
greater
part
of
what
we
had
heard
was
found
to
be
only
a
tissue
of
falsehoods
the
rivers
that
we
found
on
it
were
never
mentioned
and
others
particularly
described
in
name
and
locality
were
subsequently
seen
in
another
part
of
the
country
it
was
described
as
a
tolerably
good
sandy
road
with
so
little
rock
as
scarcely
to
require
the
animals
to
be
shod
and
we
found
it
the
roughest
and
rockiest
road
we
had
ever
seen
in
the
country
and
which
nearly
destroyed
our
band
of
fine
mules
and
horses
many
animals
are
destroyed
on
it
every
year
by
a
disease
called
the
and
a
traveler
should
never
venture
on
it
without
having
his
animals
well
shod
and
also
carrying
extra
shoes
latitude
and
longitude
the
morning
of
the
was
clear
and
bright
and
a
snowy
peak
to
the
southward
shone
out
high
and
sharply
defined
as
has
been
usual
since
we
crossed
the
mountains
and
descended
into
the
hot
plains
we
had
a
gale
of
wind
we
traveled
down
the
right
bank
of
the
stream
over
sands
which
are
somewhat
loose
and
have
no
verdure
but
are
occupied
by
various
shrubs
a
clear
bold
stream
feet
wide
and
several
feet
deep
had
a
strange
appearance
running
between
perfectly
naked
banks
of
sand
the
eye
however
is
somewhat
relieved
by
willows
and
the
beautiful
green
of
the
sweet
cottonwoods
with
which
it
is
well
wooded
as
we
followed
along
its
course
the
river
instead
of
growing
constantly
larger
gradually
dwindled
away
as
it
was
absorbed
by
the
sand
we
were
now
careful
to
take
the
old
of
the
annual
santa
fé
caravans
which
luckily
for
us
had
not
yet
made
their
yearly
passage
a
drove
of
several
thousand
horses
and
mules
would
entirely
have
swept
away
the
scanty
grass
at
the
watering
places
and
we
should
have
been
obliged
to
leave
the
road
to
obtain
subsistence
for
our
animals
after
riding
miles
in
a
direction
we
found
an
old
encampment
where
we
halted
by
observation
the
elevation
of
this
encampment
is
feet
the
trail
followed
still
along
the
river
which
in
the
course
of
the
morning
entirely
disappeared
we
continued
along
the
dry
bed
in
which
after
an
interval
of
about
miles
the
water
reappeared
in
some
low
places
well
timbered
with
cottonwood
and
willow
where
was
another
of
the
customary
here
a
party
of
six
indians
came
into
camp
poor
and
hungry
and
quite
in
keeping
with
the
character
of
the
country
their
arms
were
bows
of
unusual
length
and
each
had
a
large
gourd
strengthened
with
meshes
of
cord
in
which
he
carried
water
they
proved
to
be
the
mohahve
indians
mentioned
by
our
recent
guide
and
from
one
of
them
who
spoke
spanish
fluently
i
obtained
some
interesting
information
which
i
would
be
glad
to
introduce
here
an
account
of
the
people
inhabiting
this
region
would
undoubtedly
possess
interest
for
the
civilized
world
our
journey
homewards
was
fruitful
in
incident
and
the
country
through
which
we
traveled
although
a
desert
afforded
much
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
the
botanist
but
limited
time
and
the
rapidly
advancing
season
for
active
operations
oblige
me
to
omit
all
extended
descriptions
and
hurry
briefly
to
the
conclusion
of
this
report
the
indian
who
spoke
spanish
had
been
educated
for
a
number
of
years
at
one
of
the
spanish
missions
and
at
the
breaking
up
of
those
establishments
had
returned
to
the
mountains
where
he
had
been
found
by
a
party
of
sometimes
called
indians
among
whom
he
had
ever
since
resided
he
spoke
of
the
leader
of
the
present
party
as
my
master
he
said
they
lived
upon
a
large
river
in
the
southeast
which
the
soldiers
called
the
rio
colorado
but
that
formerly
a
portion
of
them
lived
upon
this
river
and
among
the
mountains
which
had
bounded
the
river
valley
to
the
northward
during
the
day
and
that
here
along
the
river
they
had
raised
various
kinds
of
melons
they
sometimes
came
over
to
trade
with
the
indians
of
the
sierra
bringing
with
them
blankets
and
goods
manufactured
by
the
monquis
and
other
colorado
indians
they
rarely
carried
home
horses
on
account
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
them
across
the
desert
and
of
guarding
them
afterwards
from
the
indians
who
inhabit
the
sierra
at
the
head
of
the
river
of
the
virgin
he
informed
us
that
a
short
distance
below
this
river
finally
disappeared
the
two
different
portions
in
which
water
is
found
had
received
from
the
priests
two
different
names
and
subsequently
i
heard
it
called
by
the
spaniards
the
de
las
but
on
the
map
we
have
called
it
the
river
we
continued
down
the
stream
or
rather
its
bed
for
about
eight
miles
where
there
was
water
still
in
several
holes
and
encamped
the
caravans
sometimes
continued
below
to
the
end
of
the
river
from
which
there
is
a
very
long
of
perhaps
miles
without
water
here
a
singular
and
new
species
of
acacia
with
spiral
pods
or
made
its
first
appearance
becoming
henceforward
for
a
considerable
distance
the
characteristic
tree
it
was
here
comparatively
large
being
about
feet
in
height
with
a
full
and
spreading
top
the
lower
branches
declining
towards
the
ground
it
afterwards
occurred
of
smaller
size
frequently
in
groves
and
is
very
fragrant
it
has
been
called
by
torrey
the
zygophyllaceous
shrub
had
been
constantly
characteristic
of
the
plains
along
the
river
and
here
among
many
new
plants
a
new
and
very
remarkable
species
of
eriogonum
tor
frem
made
its
first
appearance
our
cattle
had
become
so
tired
and
poor
by
this
fatiguing
traveling
that
three
of
them
were
killed
here
and
the
meat
dried
the
indians
had
now
an
occasion
for
a
great
feast
and
were
occupied
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
all
night
in
cooking
and
eating
there
was
no
part
of
the
animal
for
which
they
did
not
find
some
use
except
the
bones
in
the
afternoon
we
were
surprised
by
the
sudden
appearance
in
the
camp
of
two
mexicans
a
man
and
a
boy
the
name
of
the
man
was
and
that
of
the
boy
a
handsome
lad

old
they
belonged
to
a
party
consisting
of
six
persons
the
remaining
four
being
the
wife
of
fuentes
and
the
father
and
mother
of
pablo
and
santiago
giacome
a
resident
of
new
mexico
with
a
cavalcade
of
about
thirty
horses
they
had
come
out
from
puebla
de
los
angeles
near
the
coast
under
the
guidance
of
giacome
in
advance
of
the
great
caravan
in
order
to
travel
more
at
leisure
and
obtain
better
grass
having
advanced
as
far
into
the
desert
as
was
considered
consistent
with
their
safety
they
halted
at
the
one
of
the
customary
about
miles
from
our
encampment
where
there
is
a
spring
of
good
water
with
sufficient
grass
and
concluded
to
await
there
the
arrival
of
the
great
caravan
several
indians
were
soon
discovered
lurking
about
the
camp
who
in
a
day
or
two
after
came
in
and
after
behaving
in
a
very
friendly
manner
took
their
leave
without
awakening
any
suspicions
their
deportment
begat
a
security
which
proved
fatal
in
a
few
days
afterwards
suddenly
a
party
of
about
one
hundred
indians
appeared
in
sight
advancing
towards
the
camp
it
was
too
late
or
they
seemed
not
to
have
presence
of
mind
to
take
proper
measures
of
safety
and
the
indians
charged
down
into
their
camp
shouting
as
they
advanced
and
discharging
flights
of
arrows
pablo
and
fuentes
were
on
at
the
time
and
mounted
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
one
of
the
principal
objects
of
the
indians
was
to
get
possession
of
the
horses
and
part
of
them
immediately
surrounded
the
band
but
in
obedience
to
the
shouts
of
giacome
fuentes
drove
the
animals
over
and
through
the
assailants
in
spite
of
their
arrows
and
abandoning
the
rest
to
their
fate
carried
them
off
at
speed
across
the
plain
knowing
that
they
would
be
pursued
by
the
indians
without
making
any
halt
except
to
shift
their
saddles
to
other
horses
they
drove
them
on
for
about
sixty
miles
and
this
morning
left
them
at
a
on
the
trail
called
agua
de
tomaso
without
giving
themselves
any
time
for
rest
they
hurried
on
hoping
to
meet
the
spanish
caravan
when
they
discovered
my
camp
i
received
them
kindly
taking
them
into
my
own
mess
and
promised
them
such
aid
as
circumstances
might
put
it
in
my
power
to
give
we
left
the
river
abruptly
and
turning
to
the
north
regained
in
a
few
miles
the
main
trail
which
had
left
the
river
sooner
than
ourselves
and
continued
our
way
across
a
lower
ridge
of
the
mountain
through
a
miserable
tract
of
sand
and
gravel
we
crossed
at
intervals
the
broad
beds
of
dry
gullies
where
in
the
seasons
of
rains
and
melting
snows
there
would
be
brooks
or
rivulets
and
at
one
of
these
where
there
was
no
indication
of
water
were
several
holes
in
which
there
was
water
at
the
depth
of
two
feet
these
holes
had
been
dug
by
the
wolves
whose
keen
sense
of
smell
had
scented
the
water
under
the
dry
sand
they
were
nice
little
wells
narrow
and
dug
straight
down
and
we
got
pleasant
water
out
of
them
the
country
had
now
assumed
the
character
of
an
elevated
and
mountainous
desert
its
general
features
being
black
rocky
ridges
bald
and
destitute
of
timber
with
sandy
basins
between
where
the
sides
of
these
ridges
are
washed
by
gullies
the
plains
below
are
strewed
with
beds
of
large
pebbles
or
rolled
stones
destructive
to
our
animals
accustomed
to
the
soft
plains
of
the
sacramento
valley
through
these
sandy
basins
sometimes
struggled
a
scanty
stream
or
occurred
a
hole
of
water
which
furnished
for
travelers
frequently
in
our
journey
across
snow
was
visible
on
the
surrounding
mountains
but
their
waters
rarely
reached
the
sandy
plain
below
where
we
toiled
along
oppressed
with
thirst
and
a
burning
sun
but
throughout
this
nakedness
of
sand
and
gravel
were
many
beautiful
plants
and
flowering
shrubs
which
occurred
in
many
new
species
and
with
greater
variety
than
we
had
been
accustomed
to
see
in
the
most
luxuriant
prairie
countries
this
was
a
peculiarity
of
this
desert
even
where
no
grass
would
take
root
the
naked
sand
would
bloom
with
some
rich
and
rare
flower
which
found
its
appropriate
home
in
the
arid
and
barren
spot
scattered
over
the
plain
and
tolerably
abundant
was
a
handsome
leguminous
shrub
three
or
four
feet
high
with
fine
bright
purple
flowers
it
is
a
new
and
occurred
frequently
henceforward
along
our
road
beyond
the
first
ridge
our
road
bore
a
little
to
the
east
of
north
towards
a
gap
in
a
higher
line
of
mountains
and
after
traveling
about
miles
we
arrived
at
the
de
the
spring
where
the
horses
had
been
left
but
as
we
expected
they
were
gone
a
brief
examination
of
the
ground
convinced
us
that
they
had
been
driven
off
by
the
indians
carson
and
godey
volunteered
with
the
mexican
to
pursue
them
and
well
mounted
the
three
set
off
on
the
trail
at
this
there
are
a
few
bushes
and
a
very
little
grass
its
water
was
a
pool
but
near
by
was
a
spring
which
had
been
dug
out
by
indians
or
travelers
its
water
was
cool
a
great
refreshment
to
us
under
a
burning
sun
in
the
evening
fuentes
returned
his
horse
having
failed
but
carson
and
godey
had
continued
the
pursuit
i
observed
an
occultation
of
at
the
dark
limb
of
the
moon
which
gives
for
the
longitude
of
the
place
the
latitude
by
observation
is
from
helvetia
to
this
place
the
positions
along
the
intervening
line
are
laid
down
with
the
longitudes
obtained
from
the
chronometer
which
appears
to
have
retained
its
rate
remarkably
well
but
henceforward
to
the
end
of
our
journey
the
few
longitudes
given
are
absolute
depending
upon
a
subsequent
occultation
and
eclipses
of
the
satellites
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
a
was
heard
such
as
indians
make
when
returning
from
a
victorious
enterprise
and
soon
carson
and
godey
appeared
driving
before
them
a
band
of
horses
recognised
by
fuentes
to
be
part
of
those
they
had
lost
two
bloody
scalps
dangling
from
the
end
of
godey
gun
announced
that
they
had
overtaken
the
indians
as
well
as
the
horses
they
informed
us
that
after
fuentes
left
them
from
the
failure
of
his
horse
they
continued
the
pursuit
alone
and
towards
entered
the
mountains
into
which
the
trail
led
after
sunset
the
moon
gave
light
and
they
followed
the
trail
by
moonshine
until
late
in
the
night
when
it
entered
a
narrow
defile
and
was
difficult
to
follow
afraid
of
losing
it
in
the
darkness
of
the
defile
they
tied
up
their
horses
struck
no
fire
and
lay
down
to
sleep
in
silence
and
in
darkness
here
they
lay
from
midnight
until
morning
at
daylight
they
resumed
the
pursuit
and
about
sunrise
discovered
the
horses
and
immediately
dismounting
and
tying
up
their
own
they
crept
cautiously
to
a
rising
ground
which
intervened
from
the
crest
of
which
they
perceived
the
encampment
of
four
lodges
close
by
they
proceeded
quietly
and
had
got
within
or
yards
of
their
object
when
a
movement
among
the
horses
discovered
them
to
the
indians
giving
the
they
instantly
charged
into
the
camp
regardless
of
the
number
which
the
lodges
would
imply
the
indians
received
them
with
a
flight
of
arrows
shot
from
their
one
of
which
passed
through
godey
barely
missing
the
neck
our
men
fired
their
rifles
upon
a
steady
aim
and
rushed
in
two
indians
were
stretched
upon
the
ground
fatally
pierced
with
bullets
the
rest
fled
except
a
little
lad
that
was
captured
the
scalps
of
the
fallen
were
instantly
stripped
off
but
in
the
process
one
of
them
who
had
two
balls
through
his
body
sprang
to
his
feet
the
blood
streaming
from
his
skinned
head
and
uttering
a
hideous
howl
an
old
squaw
possibly
his
mother
stopped
and
looked
back
from
the
mountainsides
she
was
climbing
threatening
and
lamenting
the
frightful
spectacle
appalled
the
stout
hearts
of
our
men
but
they
did
what
humanity
required
and
quickly
terminated
the
agonies
of
the
gory
savage
they
were
now
masters
of
the
camp
which
was
a
pretty
little
recess
in
the
mountain
with
a
fine
spring
and
apparently
safe
from
all
invasion
great
preparations
had
been
made
to
feast
a
large
party
for
it
was
a
very
proper
place
to
rendezvous
and
for
the
celebration
of
such
orgies
as
robbers
of
the
desert
would
delight
in
several
of
the
best
horses
had
been
killed
skinned
and
cut
up
for
the
indians
living
in
mountains
and
only
coming
into
the
plains
to
rob
and
murder
make
no
other
use
of
horses
than
to
eat
them
large
earthen
vessels
were
on
the
fire
boiling
and
stewing
the
and
several
baskets
containing
or
pairs
of
moccasins
indicated
the
presence
or
expectation
of
a
considerable
party
they
released
the
boy
who
had
given
strong
evidence
of
the
stoicism
or
something
else
of
the
savage
character
in
commencing
his
breakfast
upon
a
head
as
soon
as
he
found
he
was
not
to
be
killed
but
only
tied
as
a
prisoner
their
object
accomplished
our
men
gathered
up
all
the
surviving
horses
fifteen
in
number
returned
upon
their
trail
and
rejoined
us
at
our
camp
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
they
had
rode
about
miles
in
the
pursuit
and
return
and
all
in
hours
the
time
place
object
and
numbers
considered
this
expedition
of
carson
and
godey
may
be
considered
among
the
boldest
and
most
disinterested
which
the
annals
of
western
adventure
so
full
of
daring
deeds
can
present
two
men
in
a
savage
desert
pursue
day
and
night
an
unknown
body
of
indians
into
the
defile
of
an
unknown
mountain
attack
them
on
sight
without
counting
numbers
and
defeat
them
in
an
instant
and
for
what
to
punish
the
robbers
of
the
desert
and
to
avenge
the
wrongs
of
mexicans
whom
they
did
not
know
i
repeat
it
was
carson
and
godey
who
did
this
the
former
an
born
in
the
boonslick
county
of
missouri
the
latter
a
frenchman
born
in
louis
and
both
trained
to
western
enterprise
from
early
life
by
the
information
of
fuentes
we
had
now
to
make
a
long
stretch
of
or
miles
across
a
plain
which
lay
between
us
and
the
next
possible
camp
and
we
resumed
our
journey
late
in
the
afternoon
with
the
intention
of
traveling
through
the
night
and
avoiding
the
excessive
heat
of
the
day
which
was
oppressive
to
our
animals
for
several
hours
we
traveled
across
a
high
plain
passing
at
the
opposite
side
through
a
canon
by
the
bed
of
a
creek
running
northwardly
into
a
small
lake
beyond
and
both
of
them
being
dry
we
had
a
warm
moonshiny
night
and
traveling
directly
towards
the
we
journeyed
now
across
an
open
plain
between
that
on
the
left
being
broken
rocky
and
bald
according
to
carson
and
godey
who
had
entered
here
in
pursuit
of
the
horses
the
plain
appeared
covered
principally
with
the
already
mentioned
and
the
line
of
our
road
was
marked
by
the
skeletons
of
horses
which
were
strewed
to
considerable
breadth
over
the
plain
we
were
always
warned
on
entering
one
of
these
long
stretches
by
the
bones
of
these
animals
which
had
perished
before
they
could
reach
the
water
about
midnight
we
reached
a
considerable
now
dry
the
discharge
of
the
waters
of
this
basin
when
it
collected
any
down
which
we
descended
in
a
northwesterly
direction
the
was
overgrown
with
shrubbery
and
several
hours
before
day
it
brought
us
to
the
entrance
of
a
canon
where
we
found
water
and
encamped
this
word
is
used
by
the
spaniards
to
signify
a
defile
or
gorge
in
a
creek
or
river
where
high
rocks
press
in
close
and
make
a
narrow
way
usually
difficult
and
often
impossible
to
be
passed
in
the
morning
we
found
that
we
had
a
very
poor
a
swampy
salty
spot
with
a
little
long
unwholesome
grass
and
the
water
which
rose
in
springs
being
useful
only
to
wet
the
mouth
but
entirely
too
salt
to
drink
all
around
was
sand
and
rocks
and
skeletons
of
horses
which
had
not
been
able
to
find
support
for
their
lives
as
we
were
about
to
start
we
found
at
the
distance
of
a
few
hundred
yards
among
the
hills
to
the
southward
a
spring
of
tolerably
good
water
which
was
a
relief
to
ourselves
but
the
place
was
too
poor
to
remain
long
and
therefore
we
continued
on
this
morning
on
the
creek
were
thickets
of
acacia
in
bloom
and
very
fragrant
passing
through
the
canon
we
entered
another
sandy
basin
through
which
the
dry
continued
its
course
in
which
direction
appeared
a
high
snowy
mountain
we
traveled
through
a
barren
district
where
a
heavy
gale
was
blowing
about
the
loose
sand
and
after
a
ride
of
eight
miles
reached
a
large
creek
of
salt
and
bitter
water
running
in
a
westerly
direction
to
receive
the
we
had
left
it
is
called
by
the
spaniards
the
of
the
desert
where
we
struck
it
the
stream
bends
and
we
continued
in
a
northerly
course
up
the
ravine
of
its
valley
passing
on
the
way
a
fork
from
the
right
near
which
occurred
a
bed
of
plants
consisting
of
a
remarkable
new
genus
of
gradually
ascending
the
ravine
opened
into
a
green
valley
where
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
were
springs
of
excellent
water
we
encamped
among
groves
of
the
new
and
there
was
an
abundance
of
good
grass
for
the
animals
this
was
the
best
we
had
seen
since
we
struck
the
spanish
trail
the
day
journey
was
about
twelve
miles
we
had
to
reach
the
distant
seven
miles
where
the
mexican
party
had
been
attacked
and
leaving
our
encampment
early
we
traversed
a
part
of
the
desert
the
most
sterile
and
repulsive
we
had
yet
seen
its
prominent
features
were
dark
naked
and
dry
on
the
plains
a
few
straggling
shrubs
among
them
cactus
of
several
varieties
fuentes
pointed
out
one
called
by
the
spaniards
which
has
a
juicy
pulp
slightly
acid
and
is
eaten
by
the
traveler
to
allay
thirst
our
course
was
generally
north
and
after
crossing
an
intervening
ridge
we
descended
into
a
sandy
plain
or
basin
in
the
middle
of
which
was
the
grassy
spot
with
its
springs
and
willow
bushes
which
constitutes
a
in
the
desert
and
is
called
the
the
dead
silence
of
the
place
was
ominous
and
galloping
rapidly
up
we
found
only
the
corpses
of
the
two
men
every
thing
else
was
gone
they
were
naked
mutilated
and
pierced
with
arrows
hernandez
had
evidently
fought
and
with
desperation
he
lay
in
advance
of
the
willow
tent
which
sheltered
his
family
as
if
he
had
come
out
to
meet
danger
and
to
repulse
it
from
that
asylum
one
of
his
hands
and
both
his
legs
had
been
cut
off
giacome
who
was
a
large
and
man
was
lying
in
one
of
the
willow
shelters
pierced
with
arrows
of
the
women
no
trace
could
be
found
and
it
was
evident
they
had
been
carried
off
captive
a
little
which
had
belonged
to
mother
remained
with
the
dead
bodies
and
was
frantic
with
joy
at
seeing
pablo
he
poor
child
was
frantic
with
grief
and
filled
the
air
with
lamentations
for
his
father
and
mother
padre
mi
madre
was
his
incessant
cry
when
we
beheld
this
pitiable
sight
and
pictured
to
ourselves
the
fate
of
the
two
women
carried
off
by
savages
so
brutal
and
so
loathsome
all
compunction
for
the
indian
ceased
and
we
rejoiced
that
carson
and
godey
had
been
able
to
give
so
useful
a
lesson
to
these
american
arabs
who
lie
in
wait
to
murder
and
plunder
the
innocent
traveler
we
were
all
too
much
affected
by
the
sad
feelings
which
the
place
inspired
to
remain
an
unnecessary
moment
the
night
we
were
obliged
to
pass
there
early
in
the
morning
we
left
it
having
first
written
a
brief
account
of
what
had
happened
and
put
it
in
the
cleft
of
a
pole
planted
at
the
spring
that
the
approaching
caravan
might
learn
the
fate
of
their
friends
in
commemoration
of
the
event
we
called
the
place
de
hernandez
spring
by
observation
its
latitude
was
we
continued
our
journey
over
a
district
similar
to
that
of
the
day
before
from
the
sandy
basin
in
which
was
the
spring
we
entered
another
basin
of
the
same
character
surrounded
everywhere
by
mountains
before
us
stretched
a
high
range
rising
still
higher
to
the
left
and
terminating
in
a
snowy
mountain
after
a
day
march
of
miles
we
reached
at
evening
the
bed
of
a
stream
from
which
the
water
had
disappeared
a
little
only
remaining
in
holes
which
we
increased
by
digging
and
about
a
mile
above
the
stream
not
yet
entirely
sunk
was
spread
out
over
the
sands
affording
a
little
water
for
the
animals
the
stream
came
out
of
the
mountains
on
the
left
very
slightly
wooded
with
cottonwood
willow
and
acacia
and
a
few
and
grass
was
nearly
as
scarce
as
water
a
plant
with
showy
yellow
flowers
occurred
abundantly
at
intervals
for
the
last
two
days
and
was
among
the
characteristic
plants
may
the
air
is
rough
and
overcoats
pleasant
the
sky
is
blue
and
the
day
bright
our
road
was
over
a
plain
towards
the
foot
of
the
mountain
now
in
bloom
with
a
small
yellow
flower
is
characteristic
of
the
country
and
were
very
abundant
and
in
rich
fresh
bloom
which
wonderfully
ornaments
this
poor
country
we
encamped
at
a
spring
in
the
pass
which
had
been
the
site
of
an
old
village
here
we
found
excellent
grass
but
very
little
water
we
dug
out
the
old
spring
and
watered
some
of
our
animals
the
mountain
here
was
wooded
very
slightly
with
the
cedars
and
a
dwarf
species
of
oak
and
among
the
shrubs
were
tridentata
and
the
numerous
shrubs
which
constitute
the
vegetation
of
the
plains
are
now
in
bloom
with
flowers
of
white
yellow
red
and
purple
the
continual
rocks
and
want
of
water
and
grass
began
to
be
very
hard
on
our
mules
and
horses
but
the
principal
loss
is
occasioned
by
their
crippled
feet
the
greater
part
of
those
left
being
in
excellent
order
and
scarcely
a
day
passes
without
some
loss
and
one
by
one
fuentes
horses
are
constantly
dropping
behind
whenever
they
give
out
he
dismounts
and
cuts
off
their
tails
and
manes
to
make
the
last
advantage
one
can
gain
from
them
the
next
day
in
a
short
but
rough
ride
of
miles
we
crossed
the
mountain
and
descending
to
a
small
valley
plain
encamped
at
the
foot
of
the
ridge
on
the
bed
of
a
creek
and
found
good
grass
in
sufficient
quantity
and
abundance
of
water
in
holes
the
ridge
is
extremely
rugged
and
broken
presenting
on
this
side
a
continued
precipice
and
probably
affords
very
few
passes
many
tracks
were
seen
around
us
but
no
indians
were
visible
after
a
day
journey
of
miles
in
a
northeasterly
direction
we
encamped
in
the
midst
of
another
very
large
basin
at
a
camping
ground
called
a
term
which
the
spaniards
use
to
signify
fertile
or
marshy
plains
in
contradistinction
to
which
they
apply
to
dry
and
sterile
plains
two
narrow
streams
of
clear
water
four
or
five
feet
deep
gush
suddenly
with
a
quick
current
from
two
singularly
large
springs
these
and
other
waters
of
the
basin
pass
out
in
a
gap
to
the
eastward
the
taste
of
the
water
is
good
but
rather
too
warm
to
be
agreeable
the
temperature
being
in
the
one
and
in
the
other
they
however
afford
a
delightful
we
started
this
morning
earlier
than
usual
traveling
in
a
northeasterly
direction
across
the
plain
the
new
acacia
has
now
become
the
characteristic
tree
of
the
country
it
is
in
bloom
and
its
blossoms
are
very
fragrant
the
day
was
still
and
the
heat
which
soon
became
very
oppressive
appeared
to
bring
out
strongly
the
refreshing
scent
of
the
zygophyllaceous
shrubs
and
the
sweet
perfume
of
the
acacia
the
snowy
ridge
we
had
just
crossed
looked
out
conspicuously
in
the
northwest
in
about
five
hours
ride
we
crossed
a
gap
in
the
surrounding
ridge
and
the
appearance
of
skeletons
of
horses
very
soon
warned
us
that
we
were
engaged
in
another
dry
which
proved
the
longest
we
had
made
in
all
our
journey
between
fifty
and
sixty
miles
without
a
drop
of
water
travelers
through
countries
affording
water
and
timber
can
have
no
conception
of
our
intolerable
thirst
while
journeying
over
the
hot
yellow
sands
of
this
elevated
country
where
the
heated
air
seems
to
be
entirely
deprived
of
moisture
we
ate
occasionally
the
and
moistened
our
mouths
with
the
acid
of
the
sour
dock
hourly
expecting
to
find
water
we
continued
to
press
on
until
towards
midnight
when
after
a
hard
and
uninterrupted
march
of
hours
our
wild
mules
began
running
ahead
and
in
a
mile
or
two
we
came
to
a
bold
running
stream
so
keen
is
the
sense
of
that
animal
in
these
desert
regions
in
scenting
at
a
distance
this
necessary
of
life
according
to
the
information
we
had
received
sevier
river
was
a
tributary
of
the
colorado
and
this
accordingly
should
have
been
one
of
its
affluents
it
proved
to
be
the
de
los
river
of
the
angels
a
branch
of
the
river
of
the
virgin
on
account
of
our
animals
it
was
necessary
to
remain
at
this
place
indians
crowded
numerously
around
us
in
the
morning
and
we
were
obliged
to
keep
arms
in
hand
all
day
to
keep
them
out
of
the
camp
they
began
to
surround
the
horses
which
for
the
convenience
of
grass
we
were
guarding
a
little
above
on
the
river
these
were
immediately
driven
in
and
kept
close
to
the
camp
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
we
had
made
a
very
bad
encampment
our
fires
being
commanded
by
a
rocky
bluff
within
yards
but
notwithstanding
we
had
the
river
and
small
thickets
of
willows
on
the
other
side
several
times
during
the
day
the
camp
was
insulted
by
the
indians
but
peace
being
our
object
i
kept
simply
on
the
defensive
some
of
the
indians
were
on
the
bottoms
and
others
haranguing
us
from
the
bluffs
and
they
were
scattered
in
every
direction
over
the
hills
their
language
being
probably
a
dialect
of
the
with
the
aid
of
signs
some
of
our
people
could
comprehend
them
very
well
they
were
the
same
people
who
had
murdered
the
mexicans
and
towards
us
their
disposition
was
evidently
hostile
nor
were
we
well
disposed
towards
them
they
were
barefooted
and
nearly
naked
their
hair
gathered
up
into
a
knot
behind
and
with
his
bow
each
man
carried
a
quiver
with
thirty
or
forty
arrows
partially
drawn
out
besides
these
each
held
in
his
hand
two
or
three
arrows
for
instant
service
their
arrows
are
barbed
with
a
very
clear
translucent
stone
a
species
of
opal
nearly
as
hard
as
the
diamond
and
shot
from
their
long
bow
are
almost
as
effective
as
a
gunshot
in
these
indians
i
was
forcibly
struck
by
an
expression
of
countenance
resembling
that
in
a
beast
of
prey
and
all
their
actions
are
those
of
wild
animals
joined
to
the
restless
motion
of
the
eye
there
is
a
want
of
mind
an
absence
of
thought
and
an
action
wholly
by
impulse
strongly
expressed
and
which
constantly
recalls
the
similarity
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
a
chief
with
two
or
three
others
forced
himself
into
the
camp
bringing
with
him
his
arms
in
spite
of
my
orders
to
the
contrary
when
shown
our
weapons
he
bored
his
ear
with
his
fingers
and
said
he
could
not
hear
why
said
he
there
are
none
of
you
counting
the
people
around
the
camp
and
including
in
the
number
a
mule
that
was
being
shod
he
made
out
so
many
said
he
showing
the
number
and
we
we
are
a
great
many
and
he
pointed
to
the
hills
and
mountains
round
about
if
you
have
your
arms
said
he
twanging
his
bow
we
have
these
i
had
some
difficulty
in
restraining
the
people
particularly
carson
who
felt
an
insult
of
this
kind
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
given
by
a
more
responsible
being
do
say
that
old
man
said
he
do
you
say
that
your
life
in
danger
speaking
in
good
english
and
probably
the
old
man
was
nearer
to
his
end
than
he
will
be
before
he
meets
it
several
animals
had
been
necessarily
left
behind
near
the
camp
last
night
and
early
in
the
morning
before
me
indians
made
their
appearance
several
men
were
sent
to
bring
them
in
when
i
was
beginning
to
be
uneasy
at
their
absence
they
returned
with
information
that
they
had
been
driven
off
from
the
trail
by
indians
and
having
followed
the
tracks
in
a
short
distance
they
found
the
animals
cut
up
and
spread
out
upon
bushes
in
the
evening
i
gave
a
fatigued
horse
to
some
of
the
indians
for
a
feast
and
the
village
which
carried
him
off
refused
to
share
with
the
others
who
made
loud
complaints
from
the
rocks
of
the
partial
distribution
many
of
these
indians
had
long
sticks
hooked
at
the
end
which
they
use
in
hauling
out
lizards
and
other
small
animals
from
their
holes
during
the
day
they
occasionally
roasted
and
ate
lizards
at
our
fires
these
belong
to
the
people
who
are
generally
known
under
the
name
of
and
to
these
i
have
more
particularly
had
reference
when
occasionally
speaking
of
a
people
whose
sole
occupation
is
to
procure
food
sufficient
to
support
existence
the
formation
here
consists
of
fine
yellow
sandstone
alternating
with
a
coarse
conglomerate
in
which
the
stones
are
from
the
size
of
ordinary
gravel
to
six
or
eight
inches
in
diameter
this
is
the
formation
which
renders
the
surface
of
the
country
so
rocky
and
gives
us
now
a
road
alternately
of
loose
heavy
sands
and
rolled
stones
which
cripple
the
animals
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
on
the
following
morning
we
left
the
de
los
and
continued
our
way
through
the
same
desolate
and
revolting
country
where
lizards
were
the
only
animal
and
the
tracks
of
the
lizard
eaters
the
principal
sign
of
human
beings
after
twenty
miles
march
through
a
road
of
hills
and
heavy
sands
we
reached
the
most
dreary
river
i
have
ever
seen
a
deep
rapid
stream
almost
a
torrent
passing
swiftly
by
and
roaring
against
obstructions
the
banks
were
wooded
with
willow
acacia
and
a
frequent
plant
of
the
country
already
mentioned
growing
in
thickets
resembling
willow
and
bearing
a
small
pink
flower
crossing
it
we
encamped
on
the
left
bank
where
we
found
a
very
little
grass
our
three
remaining
steers
being
entirely
given
out
were
killed
here
by
the
boiling
point
the
elevation
of
the
river
here
is
feet
and
latitude
by
observation
the
stream
was
running
towards
the
southwest
and
appeared
to
come
from
a
snowy
mountain
in
the
north
it
proved
to
be
the
a
tributary
to
the
colorado
indians
appeared
in
bands
on
the
hills
but
did
not
come
into
camp
for
several
days
we
continued
our
journey
up
the
river
the
bottoms
of
which
were
thickly
overgrown
with
various
kinds
of
brush
and
the
sandy
soil
was
absolutely
covered
with
the
tracks
of
who
followed
us
stealthily
like
a
band
of
wolves
and
we
had
no
opportunity
to
leave
behind
even
for
a
few
hours
the
tired
animals
in
order
that
they
might
be
brought
into
camp
after
a
little
repose
a
horse
or
mule
left
behind
was
taken
off
in
a
moment
on
the
evening
of
the
having
traveled
miles
up
the
river
from
our
first
encampment
on
it
we
encamped
at
a
little
where
a
spring
of
cool
water
issued
from
the
bluff
on
the
opposite
side
was
a
grove
of
cottonwoods
at
the
mouth
of
a
fork
which
here
enters
the
river
on
either
side
the
valley
is
bounded
by
ranges
of
mountains
everywhere
high
rocky
and
broken
the
caravan
road
was
lost
and
scattered
in
the
sandy
country
and
we
had
been
following
an
indian
trail
up
the
river
the
hunters
the
next
day
were
sent
out
to
reconnoitre
and
in
the
mean
time
we
moved
about
a
mile
farther
up
where
we
found
a
good
little
patch
of
grass
there
being
only
sufficient
grass
for
the
night
the
horses
were
sent
with
a
strong
guard
in
charge
of
tabeau
to
a
neighboring
hollow
where
they
might
pasture
during
the
day
and
to
be
ready
in
case
the
indians
should
make
any
attempt
on
the
animals
several
of
the
best
horses
were
picketed
at
the
camp
in
a
few
hours
the
hunters
returned
having
found
a
convenient
ford
in
the
river
and
discovered
the
spanish
trail
on
the
other
side
i
had
been
engaged
in
arranging
plants
and
fatigued
with
the
heat
of
the
day
i
fell
asleep
in
the
afternoon
and
did
not
awake
until
sundown
presently
carson
came
to
me
and
reported
that
tabeau
who
early
in
the
day
had
left
his
post
and
without
my
knowledge
rode
back
to
the
camp
we
had
left
in
search
of
a
lame
mule
had
not
returned
while
we
were
speaking
a
smoke
rose
suddenly
from
the
cottonwood
grove
below
which
plainly
told
us
what
had
befallen
him
it
was
raised
to
inform
the
surrounding
indians
that
a
blow
had
been
struck
and
to
tell
them
to
be
on
their
guard
carson
with
several
men
well
mounted
was
instantly
sent
down
the
river
but
returned
in
the
night
without
tidings
of
the
missing
man
they
went
to
the
camp
we
had
left
but
neither
he
nor
the
mule
was
there
searching
down
the
river
they
found
the
tracks
of
the
mule
evidently
driven
along
by
indians
whose
tracks
were
on
each
side
of
those
made
by
the
animal
after
going
several
miles
they
came
to
the
mule
itself
standing
in
some
bushes
mortally
wounded
in
the
side
by
an
arrow
and
left
to
die
that
it
might
be
afterwards
butchered
for
food
they
also
found
in
another
place
as
they
were
hunting
about
on
the
ground
for
tabeau
tracks
something
that
looked
like
a
little
puddle
of
blood
but
which
the
darkness
prevented
them
from
verifying
with
these
details
they
returned
to
our
camp
and
their
report
saddened
all
our
hearts
this
morning
as
soon
as
there
was
light
enough
to
follow
tracks
i
set
out
myself
with
fitzpatrick
and
several
men
in
search
of
tabeau
we
went
to
the
spot
where
the
appearance
of
puddled
blood
had
been
seen
and
this
we
saw
at
once
had
been
the
place
where
he
fell
and
died
blood
upon
the
leaves
and
bushes
showed
that
he
had
got
his
wound
about
twenty
paces
from
where
he
fell
and
that
he
had
struggled
for
his
life
he
had
probably
been
shot
through
the
lungs
with
an
arrow
from
the
place
where
he
lay
and
bled
it
could
be
seen
that
he
had
been
dragged
to
the
river
bank
and
thrown
into
it
no
vestige
of
what
had
belonged
to
him
could
be
found
except
a
fragment
of
his
horse
equipment
horse
gun
clothes
all
became
the
prey
of
these
arabs
of
the
new
world
tabeau
had
been
one
of
our
best
men
and
his
unhappy
death
spread
a
gloom
over
our
party
men
who
have
gone
through
such
dangers
and
sufferings
as
we
had
seen
become
like
brothers
and
feel
each
loss
to
defend
and
avenge
each
other
is
the
deep
feeling
of
all
we
wished
to
avenge
his
death
but
the
condition
of
our
horses
languishing
for
grass
and
repose
forbade
an
expedition
into
unknown
mountains
we
knew
the
tribe
who
had
done
the
mischief
the
same
which
had
been
insulting
our
camp
they
knew
what
they
deserved
and
had
the
discretion
to
show
themselves
to
us
no
more
the
day
before
they
infested
our
camp
now
not
one
appeared
nor
did
we
ever
afterwards
see
but
one
who
even
belonged
to
the
same
tribe
and
he
at
a
distance
our
camp
was
in
a
basin
below
a
deep
canon
a
gap
of
two
thousand
feet
deep
in
the
mountain
through
which
the
passes
and
where
no
man
or
beast
could
follow
it
the
spanish
trail
which
we
had
lost
in
the
sands
of
the
basin
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
we
crossed
over
to
it
and
followed
it
northwardly
towards
a
gap
which
was
visible
in
the
mountain
we
approached
it
by
a
defile
rendered
difficult
for
our
barefooted
animals
by
the
rocks
strewed
along
it
and
here
the
country
changed
its
character
from
the
time
we
entered
the
desert
the
mountains
had
been
bald
and
rocky
here
they
began
to
be
wooded
with
cedar
and
pine
and
clusters
of
trees
gave
shelter
to
birds
a
new
and
welcome
sight
which
could
not
have
lived
in
the
desert
we
had
passed
descending
a
long
hollow
towards
the
narrow
valley
of
a
stream
we
saw
before
us
a
snowy
mountain
far
beyond
which
appeared
another
more
lofty
still
good
began
to
appear
on
the
and
here
we
found
a
singular
variety
of
interesting
shrubs
the
changed
appearance
of
the
country
infused
among
our
people
a
more
lively
spirit
which
was
heightened
by
finding
at
evening
a
of
very
good
grass
on
the
clear
waters
of
the
fork
of
the
the
morning
was
cloudy
and
quite
cool
with
a
shower
of
rain
the
first
we
have
had
since
entering
the
desert
a
period
of
days
and
we
seem
to
have
entered
a
different
climate
with
the
usual
weather
of
the
rocky
mountains
our
march
was
very
laborious
over
very
broken
ground
along
the
santa
clara
river
but
then
the
country
is
no
longer
so
distressingly
desolate
the
stream
is
prettily
wooded
with
sweet
cottonwood
trees
some
of
them
of
large
size
and
on
the
hills
where
the
is
often
seen
a
good
and
wholesome
grass
occurs
frequently
this
cottonwood
which
is
now
in
fruit
is
of
a
different
species
from
any
in
michaux
sylva
heavy
dark
clouds
covered
the
sky
in
the
evening
and
a
cold
wind
sprang
up
making
fires
and
overcoats
comfortable
a
little
above
our
encampment
the
river
forked
and
we
continued
up
the
branch
gradually
ascending
towards
the
summit
of
the
mountain
as
we
rose
towards
the
head
of
the
creek
the
snowy
mountains
on
our
right
showed
out
handsomely
high
and
rugged
with
precipices
and
covered
with
snow
for
about
two
thousand
feet
from
their
summits
down
our
animals
were
somewhat
repaid
for
their
hard
marches
by
an
excellent
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
which
forms
here
the
dividing
chain
between
the
waters
of
the
which
goes
south
to
the
colorado
and
those
of
sevier
river
flowing
northwardly
and
belonging
to
the
great
basin
we
considered
ourselves
as
crossing
the
rim
of
the
basin
and
entering
it
at
this
point
we
found
here
an
extensive
mountain
meadow
rich
in
and
fresh
with
numerous
springs
of
clear
water
all
refreshing
and
delightful
to
look
upon
it
was
in
fact
that
vegas
de
santa
which
had
been
so
long
presented
to
us
as
the
terminating
point
of
the
desert
and
where
the
annual
caravan
from
california
to
new
mexico
halted
and
recruited
for
some
weeks
it
was
a
very
suitable
place
to
recover
from
the
fatigue
and
exhaustion
of
a
month
suffering
in
the
hot
and
sterile
desert
the
meadow
was
about
a
mile
wide
some
ten
miles
long
bordered
by
grassy
hills
and
mountains
some
of
the
latter
rising
two
thousand
feet
and
white
with
snow
down
to
the
level
of
the
its
elevation
above
the
sea
was
feet
latitude
by
observation
and
its
distance
from
where
we
first
struck
the
spanish
trail
about
miles
counting
from
the
time
we
reached
the
desert
and
began
to
skirt
at
our
descent
from
walker
pass
in
the
sierra
nevada
we
had
traveled
miles
occupying
days
in
that
inhospitable
region
in
passing
before
the
great
caravan
we
had
the
advantage
of
finding
more
grass
but
the
disadvantage
of
finding
also
the
marauding
savages
who
had
gathered
down
upon
the
trail
waiting
the
approach
of
that
prey
this
greatly
increased
our
labors
besides
costing
us
the
life
of
an
excellent
man
we
had
to
move
all
day
in
a
state
of
watch
and
prepared
for
combat
scouts
and
flankers
out
a
front
and
rear
division
of
our
men
and
in
the
centre
at
night
camp
duty
was
severe
those
who
had
toiled
all
day
had
to
guard
by
turns
the
camp
and
the
horses
all
night
frequently
of
the
whole
party
were
on
guard
at
once
and
nothing
but
this
vigilance
saved
us
from
attack
we
were
constantly
dogged
by
bands
and
even
whole
tribes
of
marauders
and
although
tabeau
was
killed
and
our
camp
infested
and
insulted
by
some
while
swarms
of
them
remained
on
the
hills
and
there
was
manifestly
a
consultation
and
calculation
going
on
to
decide
the
question
of
attacking
us
having
reached
the
of
the
de
santa
we
had
complete
relief
from
the
heat
and
privations
of
the
desert
and
some
relaxation
from
the
severity
of
camp
duty
some
relaxation
and
relaxation
only
for
and
scouts
are
indispensable
from
the
time
of
leaving
the
frontiers
of
missouri
until
we
return
to
them
after
we
left
the
we
had
the
gratification
to
be
joined
by
the
famous
hunter
and
trapper
joseph
walker
whom
i
have
before
mentioned
and
who
now
became
our
guide
he
had
left
california
with
the
great
caravan
and
perceiving
from
the
signs
along
the
trail
that
there
was
a
party
of
whites
ahead
which
he
judged
to
be
mine
he
detached
himself
from
the
caravan
with
eight
men
americans
and
ran
the
gauntlet
of
the
desert
robbers
killing
two
and
getting
some
of
the
horses
wounded
and
succeeded
in
overtaking
us
nothing
but
his
great
knowledge
of
the
country
great
courage
and
presence
of
mind
and
good
rifles
could
have
brought
him
safe
from
such
a
perilous
enterprise
we
remained
one
day
at
this
noted
place
of
rest
and
refreshment
and
resuming
our
progress
in
a
northwestwardly
direction
we
descended
into
a
broad
valley
the
water
of
which
is
tributary
to
sevier
lake
the
next
day
we
came
in
sight
of
the
wahsatch
range
of
mountains
on
the
right
white
with
snow
and
here
forming
the
southeast
part
of
the
great
basin
sevier
lake
upon
the
waters
of
which
we
now
were
belonged
to
the
system
of
lakes
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
basin
of
which
the
great
salt
lake
and
its
southern
limb
the
utah
lake
were
the
principal
towards
the
region
of
which
we
were
now
approaching
we
traveled
for
several
days
in
this
direction
within
the
rim
of
the
great
basin
crossing
little
streams
which
bore
to
the
left
for
sevier
lake
and
plainly
seeing
by
the
changed
aspect
of
the
country
that
we
were
entirely
clear
of
the
desert
and
approaching
the
regions
which
appertained
to
the
system
of
the
rocky
mountains
we
met
in
this
traverse
a
few
mounted
utah
indians
in
advance
of
their
main
body
watching
the
approach
of
the
great
caravan
we
reached
a
small
salt
lake
about
seven
miles
long
and
one
broad
at
the
northern
extremity
of
which
we
encamped
for
the
night
this
little
lake
which
well
merits
its
characteristic
name
lies
immediately
at
the
base
of
the
range
and
nearly
opposite
a
gap
in
that
chain
of
mountains
through
which
the
spanish
trail
passes
and
which
again
falling
upon
the
waters
of
the
colorado
and
crossing
that
river
proceeds
over
a
mountainous
country
to
santa
fé
after
miles
of
traveling
on
a
trail
which
served
for
a
road
we
again
found
ourselves
under
the
necessity
of
exploring
a
track
through
the
wilderness
the
spanish
trail
had
borne
off
to
the
southeast
crossing
the
range
our
course
led
to
the
northeast
along
the
foot
of
that
range
and
leaving
it
on
the
right
the
mountain
presented
itself
to
us
under
the
form
of
several
ridges
rising
one
above
the
other
rocky
and
wooded
with
pine
and
cedar
the
last
ridge
covered
with
snow
sevier
river
flowing
northwardly
to
the
lake
of
the
same
name
collects
its
principal
waters
from
this
section
of
the
chain
we
had
now
entered
a
region
of
great
pastoral
promise
abounding
with
fine
streams
the
rich
soil
that
would
produce
wheat
and
indigenous
flax
growing
as
if
it
had
been
sown
consistent
with
the
general
character
of
its
bordering
mountains
this
fertility
of
soil
and
vegetation
does
not
extend
far
into
the
great
basin
joseph
walker
our
guide
and
who
has
more
knowledge
of
these
parts
than
any
man
i
know
informed
me
that
all
the
country
to
the
left
was
unknown
to
him
and
that
even
the
tribes
which
frequented
lake
sevier
could
tell
him
nothing
about
it
we
met
a
band
of
utah
indians
headed
by
a
chief
who
had
obtained
the
american
or
english
name
of
walker
by
which
he
is
quoted
and
well
known
they
were
all
mounted
armed
with
rifles
and
used
their
rifles
well
the
chief
had
a
fusee
which
he
carried
slung
in
addition
to
his
rifle
they
were
journeying
slowly
towards
the
spanish
trail
to
levy
their
usual
tribute
upon
the
great
california
caravan
they
were
robbers
of
a
higher
order
than
those
of
the
desert
they
conducted
their
depredations
with
form
and
under
the
color
of
trade
and
toll
for
passing
through
their
country
instead
of
attacking
and
killing
they
affect
to
purchase
taking
the
horses
they
like
and
giving
something
nominal
in
return
the
chief
was
quite
civil
to
me
he
was
personally
acquainted
with
his
namesake
our
guide
who
made
my
name
known
to
him
he
knew
of
my
expedition
of
and
as
tokens
of
friendship
and
proof
that
we
had
met
proposed
an
interchange
of
presents
we
had
no
great
store
to
choose
out
of
so
he
gave
me
a
mexican
blanket
and
i
gave
him
a
very
fine
one
which
i
had
obtained
at
vancouver
we
reached
sevier
river
the
main
tributary
of
the
lake
of
the
same
name
which
deflecting
from
its
northern
course
here
breaks
from
the
mountains
to
enter
the
lake
it
was
really
a
fine
river
from
eight
to
twelve
feet
deep
and
after
searching
in
vain
for
a
fordable
place
we
made
little
boats
or
rather
rafts
out
of
bulrushes
and
ferried
across
these
rafts
are
readily
made
and
give
a
good
conveyance
across
a
river
the
rushes
are
bound
in
bundles
and
tied
hard
the
bundles
are
tied
down
upon
poles
as
close
as
they
can
be
pressed
and
fashioned
like
a
boat
in
being
broader
in
the
middle
and
pointed
at
the
ends
the
rushes
being
tubular
and
jointed
are
light
and
strong
the
raft
swims
well
and
is
shoved
along
by
poles
or
paddled
or
pushed
and
pulled
by
swimmers
or
drawn
by
ropes
on
this
occasion
we
used
ropes
one
at
each
end
and
rapidly
drew
our
little
float
backwards
and
forwards
from
shore
to
shore
the
horses
swam
at
our
place
of
crossing
which
was
the
most
northern
point
of
its
bend
the
latitude
was
the
banks
sustained
the
character
for
fertility
and
vegetation
which
we
had
seen
for
some
days
the
name
of
this
river
and
lake
was
an
indication
of
our
approach
to
regions
of
which
our
people
had
been
the
explorers
it
was
probably
named
after
some
american
trapper
or
hunter
and
was
the
first
american
name
we
had
met
with
since
leaving
the
columbia
river
from
the
dalles
to
the
point
where
we
turned
across
the
sierra
nevada
near
miles
we
heard
indian
names
and
the
greater
part
of
the
distance
none
from
nueva
helvetia
sacramento
to
vegas
de
santa
about
more
all
were
spanish
from
the
mississippi
to
the
pacific
french
and
american
or
english
were
intermixed
and
this
prevalence
of
names
indicates
the
national
character
of
the
first
explorers
we
had
here
the
misfortune
to
lose
one
of
our
people
françois
badeau
who
had
been
with
me
on
both
expeditions
during
which
he
had
always
been
one
of
my
most
faithful
and
efficient
men
he
was
killed
in
drawing
towards
him
a
gun
by
the
muzzle
the
hammer
being
caught
discharged
the
gun
driving
the
ball
through
his
head
we
buried
him
on
the
banks
of
the
river
crossing
the
next
day
a
slight
ridge
along
the
river
we
entered
a
handsome
mountain
valley
covered
with
fine
grass
and
directed
our
course
towards
a
high
snowy
peak
at
the
foot
of
which
lay
the
utah
lake
on
our
right
was
a
bed
of
high
mountains
their
summits
covered
with
snow
constituting
the
dividing
ridge
between
the
basin
waters
and
those
of
the
colorado
at
noon
we
fell
in
with
a
party
of
utah
indians
coming
out
of
the
mountain
and
in
the
afternoon
encamped
on
a
tributary
to
the
lake
which
is
separated
from
the
waters
of
the
sevier
by
very
slight
dividing
grounds
early
the
next
day
we
came
in
sight
of
the
lake
and
as
we
descended
to
the
broad
bottoms
of
the
spanish
fork
three
horsemen
were
seen
galloping
towards
us
who
proved
to
be
utah
indians
scouts
from
a
village
which
was
encamped
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
they
were
armed
with
rifles
and
their
horses
were
in
good
condition
we
encamped
near
them
on
the
spanish
fork
which
is
one
of
the
principal
tributaries
to
the
lake
finding
the
indians
troublesome
and
desirous
to
remain
here
a
day
we
removed
the
next
morning
farther
down
the
lake
and
encamped
on
a
fertile
bottom
near
the
foot
of
the
same
mountainous
ridge
which
borders
the
great
salt
lake
and
along
which
we
had
journeyed
the
previous
september
here
the
principal
plants
in
bloom
were
two
which
were
remarkable
as
affording
to
the
snake
indians
the
one
an
abundant
supply
of
food
and
the
other
the
most
useful
among
the
applications
which
they
use
for
wounds
these
were
the
kooyah
plant
growing
in
fields
of
extraordinary
luxuriance
and
which
from
the
experience
of
walker
is
the
best
remedial
plant
known
among
these
indians
a
few
miles
below
us
was
another
village
of
indians
from
which
we
obtained
some
fish
among
them
a
few
salmon
trout
which
were
very
much
inferior
in
size
to
those
along
the
californian
mountains
the
season
for
taking
them
had
not
yet
arrived
but
the
indians
were
daily
expecting
them
to
come
up
out
of
the
lake
we
had
now
accomplished
an
object
we
had
in
view
when
leaving
the
dalles
of
the
columbia
in
november
last
we
had
reached
the
utah
lake
but
by
a
route
very
different
from
the
one
we
had
intended
and
without
sufficient
time
remaining
to
make
the
examinations
which
we
desired
it
is
a
lake
of
note
in
this
country
under
the
dominion
of
the
utahs
who
resort
to
it
for
fish
its
greatest
breadth
is
about
fifteen
miles
stretching
far
to
the
north
narrowing
as
it
goes
and
connecting
with
the
great
salt
lake
this
is
the
report
which
i
believe
to
be
correct
but
it
is
fresh
water
while
the
other
is
not
only
salt
but
a
saturated
solution
of
salt
and
here
is
a
problem
which
requires
to
be
solved
it
is
almost
entirely
surrounded
by
mountains
walled
on
the
north
and
east
by
a
high
and
snowy
range
which
supplies
to
it
a
fan
of
tributary
streams
among
these
the
principal
river
is
the
signifying
rock
river
a
name
which
the
rocky
grandeur
of
its
scenery
remarkable
even
in
this
country
of
rugged
mountains
has
obtained
for
it
from
the
indians
in
the
utah
language
the
term
for
river
when
coupled
with
other
words
in
common
conversation
is
usually
abbreviated
to
signifying
rock
it
is
probable
that
this
river
furnished
the
name
which
on
the
older
maps
has
been
generally
applied
to
the
great
salt
lake
but
for
this
i
have
preferred
a
name
which
will
be
regarded
as
highly
characteristic
restricting
to
the
river
the
descriptive
term
and
leaving
for
the
lake
into
which
it
flows
the
name
of
the
people
who
reside
on
its
shores
and
by
which
it
is
known
throughout
the
country
the
volume
of
water
afforded
by
the
is
probably
equal
to
that
of
the
sevier
river
and
at
the
time
of
our
visit
there
was
only
one
place
in
the
at
which
the
spanish
fork
was
fordable
in
the
cove
of
the
mountains
along
its
eastern
shore
the
lake
is
bordered
by
a
plain
where
the
soil
is
generally
good
and
in
greater
part
fertile
watered
by
a
delta
of
prettily
timbered
streams
this
would
be
an
excellent
locality
for
it
is
generally
covered
with
good
and
would
abundantly
produce
the
ordinary
grains
in
arriving
at
the
utah
lake
we
had
completed
an
immense
circuit
of
twelve
degrees
diameter
north
and
south
and
ten
degrees
east
and
west
and
found
ourselves
in
may
on
the
same
sheet
of
water
which
we
had
left
in
september
the
utah
is
the
southern
limb
of
the
great
salt
lake
and
thus
we
had
seen
that
remarkable
sheet
of
water
both
at
its
northern
and
southern
extremity
and
were
able
to
fix
its
position
at
these
two
points
the
circuit
which
we
had
made
and
which
had
cost
us
eight
months
of
time
and
miles
of
traveling
had
given
us
a
view
of
oregon
and
of
north
california
from
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
pacific
ocean
and
of
the
two
principal
streams
which
form
bays
or
harbors
on
the
coast
of
that
sea
having
completed
this
circuit
and
being
now
about
to
turn
the
back
upon
the
pacific
slope
of
our
continent
and
to
recross
the
rocky
mountains
it
is
natural
to
look
back
upon
our
footsteps
and
take
some
brief
view
of
the
leading
features
and
general
structure
of
the
country
we
had
traversed
these
are
peculiar
and
striking
and
differ
essentially
from
the
atlantic
side
of
the
country
the
mountains
all
are
higher
more
numerous
and
more
distinctly
defined
in
their
ranges
and
directions
and
what
is
so
contrary
to
the
natural
order
of
formations
one
of
these
ranges
which
is
near
the
coast
the
sierra
nevada
and
the
coast
range
presents
higher
elevations
and
peaks
than
any
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
rocky
mountains
themselves
in
our
eight
months
circuit
we
were
never
out
of
sight
of
snow
and
the
sierra
nevada
where
we
crossed
it
was
near
feet
higher
than
the
south
pass
in
the
rocky
mountains
in
height
these
mountains
greatly
exceed
those
of
the
atlantic
side
constantly
presenting
peaks
which
enter
the
region
of
eternal
snow
and
some
of
them
volcanic
and
in
a
frequent
state
of
activity
they
are
seen
at
great
distances
and
guide
the
traveler
in
his
course
the
course
and
elevation
of
these
ranges
give
direction
to
the
rivers
and
character
to
the
coast
no
great
river
does
or
can
take
its
rise
below
the
cascade
and
sierra
nevada
range
the
distance
to
the
sea
is
too
short
to
admit
of
it
the
rivers
of
the
san
francisco
bay
which
are
the
largest
after
the
columbia
are
local
to
that
bay
and
lateral
to
the
coast
having
their
sources
about
on
a
line
with
the
dalles
of
the
columbia
and
running
each
in
a
valley
of
its
own
between
the
coast
range
and
the
cascade
and
sierra
nevada
range
the
columbia
is
the
only
river
which
traverses
the
whole
breadth
of
the
country
breaking
through
all
the
ranges
and
entering
the
sea
drawing
its
waters
from
a
section
of
ten
degrees
of
latitude
in
the
rocky
mountains
which
are
collected
into
one
stream
by
three
main
forks
lewis
clark
and
the
north
fork
near
the
centre
of
the
oregon
valley
this
great
river
thence
proceeds
by
a
single
channel
to
the
sea
while
its
three
forks
lead
each
to
a
pass
in
the
mountains
which
opens
the
way
into
the
interior
of
the
continent
this
fact
in
relation
to
the
rivers
of
this
region
gives
an
immense
value
to
the
columbia
its
mouth
is
the
only
inlet
and
outlet
to
and
from
the
sea
its
three
forks
lead
to
the
passes
in
the
mountains
it
is
therefore
the
only
line
of
communication
between
the
pacific
and
the
interior
of
north
america
and
all
operations
of
war
or
commerce
of
national
or
social
intercourse
must
be
conducted
upon
it
this
gives
it
a
value
beyond
estimation
and
would
involve
irreparable
injury
if
lost
in
this
unity
and
concentration
of
its
waters
the
pacific
side
of
our
continent
differs
entirely
from
the
atlantic
side
where
the
waters
of
the
alleghany
mountains
are
dispersed
into
many
rivers
having
their
different
entrances
into
the
sea
and
opening
many
lines
of
communication
with
the
interior
the
pacific
coast
is
equally
different
from
that
of
the
atlantic
the
coast
of
the
atlantic
is
low
and
open
indented
with
numerous
bays
sounds
and
river
estuaries
accessible
everywhere
and
opening
by
many
channels
into
the
heart
of
the
country
the
pacific
coast
on
the
contrary
is
high
and
compact
with
few
bays
and
but
one
that
opens
into
the
heart
of
the
country
the
immediate
coast
is
what
the
seamen
call
a
little
within
it
is
skirted
by
two
successive
ranges
of
mountains
standing
as
ramparts
between
the
sea
and
the
interior
of
the
country
and
to
get
through
which
there
is
but
one
gate
and
that
narrow
and
easily
defended
this
structure
of
the
coast
backed
by
these
two
ranges
of
mountains
with
its
concentration
and
unity
of
waters
gives
to
the
country
an
immense
military
strength
and
will
probably
render
oregon
the
most
impregnable
country
in
the
world
differing
so
much
from
the
atlantic
side
of
our
continent
in
coast
mountains
and
rivers
the
pacific
side
differs
from
it
in
another
most
rare
and
singular
feature
that
of
the
great
interior
basin
of
which
i
have
so
often
spoken
and
the
whole
form
and
character
of
which
i
was
so
anxious
to
ascertain
its
existence
is
vouched
for
by
such
of
the
american
traders
and
hunters
as
have
some
knowledge
of
that
region
the
structure
of
the
sierra
nevada
range
of
mountains
requires
it
to
be
there
and
my
own
observations
confirm
it
joseph
walker
who
is
so
well
acquainted
in
these
parts
informed
me
that
from
the
great
salt
lake
west
there
was
a
succession
of
lakes
and
rivers
which
have
no
outlet
to
the
sea
nor
any
connection
with
the
columbia
or
with
the
colorado
of
the
gulf
of
california
he
described
some
of
these
lakes
as
being
large
with
numerous
streams
and
even
considerable
rivers
falling
into
them
in
fact
all
concur
in
the
general
report
of
these
interior
rivers
and
lakes
and
for
want
of
understanding
the
force
and
power
of
evaporation
which
so
soon
establishes
an
equilibrium
between
the
loss
and
supply
of
waters
the
fable
of
whirlpools
and
subterraneous
outlets
has
gained
belief
as
the
only
imaginable
way
of
carrying
off
the
waters
which
have
no
visible
discharge
the
structure
of
the
country
would
require
this
formation
of
interior
lakes
for
the
waters
which
would
collect
between
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
sierra
nevada
not
being
able
to
cross
this
formidable
barrier
nor
to
get
to
the
columbia
or
the
colorado
must
naturally
collect
into
reservoirs
each
of
which
would
have
its
little
system
of
streams
and
rivers
to
supply
it
this
would
be
the
natural
effect
and
what
i
saw
went
to
confirm
it
the
great
salt
lake
is
a
formation
of
this
kind
and
quite
a
large
one
and
having
many
streams
and
one
considerable
river
or
miles
long
falling
into
it
this
lake
and
river
i
saw
and
examined
myself
and
also
saw
the
and
bear
river
mountains
which
enclose
the
waters
of
the
lake
on
the
east
and
constitute
in
that
quarter
the
rim
of
the
great
basin
afterwards
along
the
eastern
base
of
the
sierra
nevada
where
we
traveled
for
days
i
saw
the
line
of
lakes
and
rivers
which
lie
at
the
foot
of
that
sierra
and
which
sierra
is
the
western
rim
of
the
basin
in
going
down
fork
and
the
main
columbia
i
crossed
only
inferior
streams
coming
in
from
the
left
such
as
could
draw
their
water
from
a
short
distance
only
and
i
often
saw
the
mountains
at
their
heads
white
with
snow
which
all
accounts
said
divided
the
waters
of
the
from
those
of
the
columbia
and
which
could
be
no
other
than
the
range
of
mountains
which
form
the
rim
of
the
basin
on
its
northern
side
and
in
returning
from
california
along
the
spanish
trail
as
far
as
the
head
of
the
santa
clara
fork
of
the
rio
virgen
i
crossed
only
small
streams
making
their
way
south
to
the
colorado
or
lost
in
sand
as
the
while
to
the
left
lofty
mountains
their
summits
white
with
snow
were
often
visible
and
which
must
have
turned
water
to
the
north
as
well
as
to
the
south
and
thus
constituted
on
this
part
the
southern
rim
of
the
basin
at
the
head
of
the
santa
clara
fork
and
in
the
vegas
de
santa
clara
we
crossed
the
ridge
which
parted
the
two
systems
of
waters
we
entered
the
basin
at
that
point
and
have
traveled
in
it
ever
since
having
its
southeastern
rim
the
mountain
on
the
right
and
crossing
the
streams
which
flow
down
into
it
the
existence
of
the
basin
is
therefore
an
established
fact
in
my
mind
its
extent
and
contents
are
yet
to
be
better
ascertained
it
can
not
be
less
than
or
miles
each
way
and
must
lie
principally
in
the
alta
california
the
demarcation
latitude
of
probably
cutting
a
segment
from
the
north
part
of
the
rim
of
its
interior
but
little
is
known
it
is
called
a
and
from
what
i
saw
of
it
sterility
may
be
its
prominent
characteristic
but
where
there
is
so
much
water
there
must
be
some
the
great
river
and
the
great
lake
reported
may
not
be
equal
to
the
report
but
where
there
is
so
much
snow
there
must
be
streams
and
where
there
is
no
outlet
there
must
be
lakes
to
hold
the
accumulated
waters
or
sands
to
swallow
them
up
in
this
eastern
part
of
the
basin
containing
sevier
utah
and
the
great
salt
lakes
and
the
rivers
and
creeks
falling
into
them
we
know
there
is
good
soil
and
good
grass
adapted
to
civilized
settlements
in
the
western
part
on
salmon
trout
river
and
some
other
streams
the
same
remark
may
be
made
the
contents
of
this
great
basin
are
yet
to
be
examined
that
it
is
peopled
we
know
but
miserably
and
sparsely
from
all
that
i
heard
and
saw
i
should
say
that
humanity
here
appeared
in
its
lowest
form
and
in
its
most
elementary
state
dispersed
in
single
families
without
eating
seeds
and
insects
digging
roots
and
hence
their
name
such
is
the
condition
of
the
greater
part
others
are
a
degree
higher
and
live
in
communities
upon
some
lake
or
river
that
supplies
fish
and
from
which
they
repulse
the
miserable
the
rabbit
is
the
largest
animal
known
in
this
desert
its
flesh
affords
a
little
meat
and
their
covering
is
made
of
its
skins
the
wild
sage
is
their
only
wood
and
here
it
is
of
extraordinary
size
sometimes
a
foot
in
diameter
and
six
or
eight
feet
high
it
serves
for
fuel
for
building
material
for
shelter
to
the
rabbits
and
for
some
sort
of
covering
for
the
feet
and
legs
in
cold
weather
such
are
the
accounts
of
the
inhabitants
and
productions
of
the
great
basin
and
which
though
imperfect
must
have
some
foundation
and
excite
our
desire
to
know
the
whole
the
whole
idea
of
such
a
desert
and
such
a
people
is
a
novelty
in
our
country
and
excites
asiatic
not
american
ideas
interior
basins
with
their
own
systems
of
lakes
and
rivers
and
often
sterile
are
common
enough
in
asia
people
still
in
the
elementary
state
of
families
living
in
deserts
with
no
other
occupation
than
the
mere
animal
search
for
food
may
still
be
seen
in
that
ancient
quarter
of
the
globe
but
in
america
such
things
are
new
and
strange
unknown
and
unsuspected
and
discredited
when
related
but
i
flatter
myself
that
what
is
discovered
though
not
enough
to
satisfy
curiosity
is
sufficient
to
excite
it
and
that
subsequent
explorations
will
complete
what
has
been
commenced
this
account
of
the
great
basin
it
will
be
remembered
belongs
to
the
alta
california
and
has
no
application
to
oregon
whose
capabilities
may
justify
a
separate
remark
referring
to
my
journal
for
particular
descriptions
and
for
sectional
boundaries
between
good
and
bad
districts
i
can
only
say
in
general
and
comparative
terms
that
in
that
branch
of
agriculture
which
implies
the
cultivation
of
grains
and
staple
crops
it
would
be
inferior
to
the
atlantic
states
though
many
parts
are
superior
for
wheat
while
in
the
rearing
of
flocks
and
herds
it
would
claim
a
high
place
its
grazing
capabilities
are
great
and
even
in
the
indigenous
grass
now
there
an
element
of
individual
and
national
wealth
may
be
found
in
fact
the
valuable
grasses
begin
within
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
of
the
missouri
frontier
and
extend
to
the
pacific
ocean
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
it
is
the
short
curly
grass
on
which
the
buffalo
delights
to
feed
whence
its
name
of
buffalo
and
which
is
still
good
when
dry
and
apparently
dead
west
of
those
mountains
it
is
a
larger
growth
in
clusters
and
hence
called
and
which
has
a
second
or
fall
growth
plains
and
mountains
both
exhibit
them
and
i
have
seen
good
pasturage
at
an
elevation
of
ten
thousand
feet
in
this
spontaneous
product
the
trading
or
traveling
caravans
can
find
subsistence
for
their
animals
and
in
military
operations
any
number
of
cavalry
may
be
moved
and
any
number
of
cattle
may
be
driven
and
thus
men
and
horses
be
supported
on
long
expeditions
and
even
in
winter
in
the
sheltered
situations
commercially
the
value
of
the
oregon
country
must
be
great
washed
as
it
is
by
the
north
pacific
ocean
fronting
asia
producing
many
of
the
elements
of
commerce
mild
and
healthy
in
its
climate
and
becoming
as
it
naturally
will
a
thoroughfare
for
the
east
india
and
china
trade
turning
our
faces
once
more
eastward
on
the
morning
of
the
we
left
the
utah
lake
and
continued
for
two
days
to
ascend
the
spanish
fork
which
is
dispersed
in
numerous
branches
among
very
rugged
mountains
which
afford
few
passes
and
render
a
familiar
acquaintance
with
them
necessary
to
the
traveler
the
stream
can
scarcely
be
said
to
have
a
valley
the
mountains
rising
often
abruptly
from
the
edge
but
a
good
trail
facilitated
our
traveling
and
there
were
frequent
bottoms
covered
with
excellent
grass
the
streams
are
prettily
and
variously
wooded
and
everywhere
the
mountain
shows
grass
and
timber
at
our
encampment
on
the
evening
of
the
near
the
head
of
one
of
the
branches
we
had
ascended
strata
of
bituminous
limestone
were
displayed
in
an
escarpment
on
the
river
bluffs
in
which
were
contained
a
variety
of
fossil
shells
of
new
species
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
crossing
this
ridge
about
miles
to
the
northward
in
august
last
strata
of
fossiliferous
rock
were
discovered
which
have
been
referred
to
the
oolitic
period
it
is
probable
that
these
rocks
also
belong
to
the
same
formation
a
few
miles
from
this
encampment
we
reached
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
crossing
by
an
open
and
easy
pass
the
dividing
ridge
which
separates
the
waters
of
the
great
basin
from
those
of
the
colorado
we
reached
the
head
branches
of
one
of
its
larger
tributaries
which
from
the
decided
color
of
its
waters
has
received
the
name
of
white
river
the
snows
of
the
mountains
were
now
beginning
to
melt
and
all
the
little
rivulets
were
running
by
in
rivers
and
rapidly
becoming
difficult
to
ford
continuing
a
few
miles
up
a
branch
of
white
river
we
crossed
a
dividing
ridge
between
its
waters
and
those
of
the
approach
to
the
pass
which
is
the
best
known
to
walker
was
somewhat
difficult
for
packs
and
impracticable
for
wagons
all
the
streams
being
shut
in
by
narrow
ravines
and
the
narrow
trail
along
the
steep
allowing
the
passage
of
only
one
animal
at
a
time
from
the
summit
we
had
a
fine
view
of
the
snowy
bear
river
range
and
there
were
still
remaining
beds
of
snow
on
the
cold
sides
of
the
hills
near
the
pass
we
descended
by
a
narrow
ravine
in
which
was
rapidly
gathered
a
little
branch
of
the
uintah
and
halted
to
noon
about
feet
below
the
pass
at
an
elevation
by
the
boiling
point
of
feet
above
the
sea
the
next
day
we
descended
along
the
river
and
about
noon
reached
a
point
where
three
forks
come
together
fording
one
of
these
with
some
difficulty
we
continued
up
the
middle
branch
which
from
the
color
of
its
waters
is
named
the
red
river
the
few
passes
and
extremely
rugged
nature
of
the
country
give
to
it
great
strength
and
secure
the
utahs
from
the
intrusion
of
their
enemies
crossing
in
the
afternoon
a
somewhat
broken
highland
covered
in
places
with
fine
grasses
and
with
cedar
on
the
we
encamped
at
evening
on
another
tributary
to
the
called
the
fork
the
water
was
very
clear
the
stream
not
being
yet
swollen
by
the
melting
snows
and
we
forded
it
without
any
difficulty
it
is
a
considerable
branch
being
spread
out
by
islands
the
largest
arm
being
about
a
hundred
feet
wide
and
the
name
it
bears
is
probably
that
of
some
old
french
trapper
the
next
day
we
continued
down
the
river
which
we
were
twice
obliged
to
cross
and
the
water
having
risen
during
the
night
it
was
almost
everywhere
too
deep
to
be
forded
after
traveling
about
sixteen
miles
we
encamped
again
on
the
left
bank
i
obtained
here
an
occultation
of
at
the
dark
limb
of
the
moon
which
gives
for
the
longitude
of
the
place
and
the
latitude
june
we
left
the
duchesne
fork
and
after
traversing
a
broken
country
for
about
sixteen
miles
arrived
at
noon
at
another
considerable
branch
a
river
of
great
velocity
to
which
the
trappers
have
improperly
given
the
name
of
lake
fork
the
name
applied
to
it
by
the
indians
signifies
great
swiftness
and
is
the
same
which
they
use
to
express
the
speed
of
a
racehorse
it
is
spread
out
in
various
channels
over
several
hundred
yards
and
is
everywhere
too
deep
and
swift
to
be
forded
at
this
season
of
the
year
there
is
an
uninterrupted
noise
from
the
large
rocks
which
are
rolled
along
the
bed
after
infinite
difficulty
and
the
delay
of
a
day
we
succeeded
in
getting
the
stream
bridged
and
got
over
with
the
loss
of
one
of
our
animals
continuing
our
route
across
a
broken
country
of
which
the
higher
parts
were
rocky
and
timbered
with
cedar
and
the
lower
parts
covered
with
good
grass
we
reached
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
uintah
fort
a
belonging
to
roubideau
on
the
principal
fork
of
the
uintah
river
we
found
the
stream
nearly
as
rapid
and
difficult
as
the
lake
fork
divided
into
several
channels
which
were
too
broad
to
be
bridged
with
the
aid
of
guides
from
the
fort
we
succeeded
with
very
great
difficulty
in
fording
it
and
encamped
near
the
fort
which
is
situated
a
short
distance
above
the
junction
of
two
branches
which
make
the
river
by
an
immersion
of
the
first
satellite
agreeing
well
with
the
result
of
the
occultation
observed
at
the
duchesne
fork
the
longitude
of
the
post
is
the
latitude
it
has
a
motley
garrison
of
canadian
and
spanish
and
hunters
with
the
usual
number
of
indian
women
we
obtained
a
small
supply
of
sugar
and
coffee
with
some
dried
meat
and
a
cow
which
was
a
very
acceptable
change
from
the
on
which
we
had
subsisted
for
some
weeks
past
i
strengthened
my
party
at
this
place
by
the
addition
of
auguste
archambeau
an
excellent
voyageur
and
hunter
belonging
to
the
class
of
carson
and
godey
on
the
morning
of
the
we
left
the
fort
footnote
this
fort
was
attacked
and
taken
by
a
band
of
the
utah
indians
since
we
passed
it
and
the
men
of
the
garrison
killed
the
women
carried
off
roubideau
a
trader
of
louis
was
absent
and
so
escaped
the
fate
of
the
rest
and
the
uintah
river
and
continued
our
road
over
a
broken
country
which
afforded
however
a
rich
addition
to
our
botanical
collection
and
after
a
march
of
miles
were
again
checked
by
another
stream
called
ashley
fork
where
we
were
detained
until
noon
of
the
next
day
an
immersion
of
the
second
satellite
gave
for
this
place
a
longitude
of
the
latitude
by
observation
being
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
we
succeeded
in
finding
a
ford
and
after
traveling
miles
encamped
high
up
on
the
where
we
found
excellent
and
abundant
grass
which
we
had
not
hitherto
seen
a
new
species
of
which
had
a
purgative
and
weakening
effect
upon
the
animals
had
occurred
abundantly
since
leaving
the
fort
from
this
point
by
observation
feet
above
the
sea
we
had
a
view
of
colorado
below
shut
up
amongst
rugged
mountains
and
which
is
the
recipient
of
all
the
streams
we
had
been
crossing
since
we
passed
the
rim
of
the
great
basin
at
the
head
of
the
spanish
fork
on
the
we
had
a
pleasant
but
long
day
journey
through
beautiful
little
valleys
and
a
high
mountain
country
arriving
about
evening
at
the
verge
of
a
steep
and
rocky
ravine
by
which
we
descended
to
this
is
a
place
well
known
to
trappers
in
the
country
where
the
canons
through
which
the
colorado
runs
expand
into
a
narrow
but
pretty
valley
about
miles
in
length
the
river
was
several
hundred
yards
in
breadth
swollen
to
the
top
of
its
banks
near
to
which
it
was
in
many
places
to
feet
deep
we
repaired
a
which
had
been
purchased
at
the
fort
and
after
a
delay
of
a
day
reached
the
opposite
banks
with
much
less
delay
than
had
been
encountered
on
the
uintah
waters
according
to
information
the
lower
end
of
the
valley
is
the
most
eastern
part
of
the
colorado
and
the
latitude
of
our
encampment
which
was
opposite
to
the
remains
of
an
old
fort
on
the
left
bank
of
the
river
was
and
by
observation
the
elevation
above
the
sea
feet
the
bearing
to
the
entrance
of
the
canon
below
was
south
east
here
the
river
enters
between
lofty
precipices
of
red
rock
and
the
country
below
is
said
to
assume
a
very
rugged
character
the
river
and
its
affluents
passing
through
canons
which
forbid
all
access
to
the
water
this
sheltered
little
valley
was
formerly
a
favorite
wintering
ground
for
the
trappers
as
it
afforded
them
sufficient
pasturage
for
their
animals
and
the
surrounding
mountains
are
well
stocked
with
game
we
surprised
a
flock
of
mountain
sheep
as
we
descended
to
the
river
and
our
hunters
killed
several
the
bottoms
of
a
small
stream
called
vermilion
creek
which
enters
the
left
bank
of
the
river
a
short
distance
below
our
encampment
were
covered
abundantly
with
and
other
chenopodiaceous
shrubs
from
the
lower
end
of
brown
hole
we
issued
by
a
remarkably
dry
canon
fifty
or
sixty
yards
wide
and
rising
as
we
advanced
to
the
height
of
six
or
eight
hundred
feet
issuing
from
this
and
crossing
a
small
green
valley
we
entered
another
rent
of
the
same
nature
still
narrower
than
the
other
the
rocks
on
either
side
rising
in
nearly
vertical
precipices
perhaps
feet
in
height
these
places
are
mentioned
to
give
some
idea
of
the
country
lower
down
on
the
colorado
to
which
the
trappers
usually
apply
the
name
of
a
canon
country
the
canon
opened
upon
a
pond
of
water
where
we
halted
to
noon
several
flocks
of
mountain
sheep
were
here
among
the
rocks
which
rung
with
volleys
of
in
the
afternoon
we
entered
upon
an
ugly
barren
and
broken
country
corresponding
well
with
that
we
had
traversed
a
few
degrees
north
on
the
same
side
of
the
colorado
the
vermilion
creek
afforded
us
brackish
water
and
indifferent
grass
for
the
night
a
few
scattered
were
the
only
improvement
of
the
country
on
the
following
day
and
at
a
little
spring
of
bad
water
where
we
halted
at
noon
we
had
not
even
the
shelter
of
these
from
the
hot
rays
of
the
sun
at
night
we
encamped
in
a
fine
grove
of
on
the
banks
of
the
elk
head
river
the
principal
fork
of
the
yampah
river
commonly
called
by
the
trappers
the
bear
river
we
made
here
a
very
strong
fort
and
formed
the
camp
into
vigilant
guards
the
country
we
were
now
entering
was
constantly
infested
by
war
parties
of
the
sioux
and
other
indians
and
is
among
the
most
dangerous
in
the
rocky
mountains
parties
of
whites
having
been
repeatedly
defeated
on
this
river
on
the
we
continued
up
the
river
which
is
a
considerable
stream
fifty
to
a
hundred
yards
in
width
handsomely
and
continuously
wooded
with
groves
of
the
cottonwood
with
these
were
thickets
of
willow
and
du
the
characteristic
plant
along
the
river
is
which
generally
covers
the
bottoms
mingled
with
this
are
saline
shrubs
and
artemisia
the
new
variety
of
grass
which
we
had
seen
on
leaving
the
uintah
fort
had
now
disappeared
the
country
on
either
side
was
sandy
and
poor
scantily
wooded
with
cedars
but
the
river
bottoms
afforded
good
pasture
three
antelopes
were
killed
in
the
afternoon
and
we
encamped
a
little
below
a
branch
of
the
river
called
vrain
fork
a
few
miles
above
was
the
fort
at
which
frapp
party
had
been
defeated
two
years
since
and
we
passed
during
the
day
a
place
where
carson
had
been
fired
upon
so
close
that
one
of
the
men
had
five
bullets
through
his
body
leaving
this
river
the
next
morning
we
took
our
way
across
the
hills
where
every
hollow
had
a
spring
of
running
water
with
good
grass
yesterday
and
we
had
before
our
eyes
the
high
mountains
which
divide
the
pacific
from
the
mississippi
waters
and
entering
here
among
the
lower
spurs
or
of
the
range
the
face
of
the
country
began
to
improve
with
a
magical
rapidity
not
only
the
river
bottoms
but
the
hills
were
covered
with
grass
and
among
the
usual
varied
flora
of
the
mountain
region
these
were
occasionally
blue
with
the
showy
bloom
of
a
in
the
course
of
the
morning
we
had
the
first
glad
view
of
buffalo
and
welcomed
the
appearance
of
two
old
bulls
with
as
much
joy
as
if
they
had
been
messengers
from
home
and
when
we
descended
to
noon
on
vrain
fork
an
affluent
of
green
river
the
hunters
brought
in
mountain
sheep
and
the
meat
of
two
fat
bulls
fresh
entrails
in
the
river
showed
us
that
there
were
indians
above
and
at
evening
judging
it
unsafe
to
encamp
in
the
bottoms
which
were
wooded
only
with
willow
thickets
we
ascended
to
the
spurs
above
and
forted
strongly
in
a
small
aspen
grove
near
to
which
was
a
spring
of
cold
water
the
hunters
killed
two
fine
cows
near
the
camp
a
band
of
elk
broke
out
of
a
neighboring
grove
antelopes
were
running
over
the
hills
and
on
the
opposite
herds
of
buffalo
were
raising
clouds
of
dust
the
country
here
appeared
more
variously
stocked
with
game
than
any
part
of
the
rocky
mountains
we
had
visited
and
its
abundance
is
owing
to
the
excellent
pasturage
and
its
dangerous
character
as
a
there
was
snow
here
near
our
mountain
camp
and
the
morning
was
beautiful
and
cool
leaving
vrain
fork
we
took
our
way
directly
towards
the
summit
of
the
dividing
ridge
the
bottoms
of
the
streams
and
level
places
were
wooded
with
aspens
and
as
we
neared
the
summit
we
entered
again
the
piny
region
we
had
a
delightful
morning
ride
the
ground
affording
us
an
excellent
and
reached
the
summit
towards
at
an
elevation
of
feet
with
joy
and
exultation
we
saw
ourselves
once
more
on
the
top
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
beheld
a
little
stream
taking
its
course
towards
the
rising
sun
it
was
an
affluent
of
the
platte
called
pullam
fork
and
we
descended
to
noon
upon
it
it
is
a
pretty
stream
twenty
yards
broad
and
bears
the
name
of
a
trapper
who
some
years
since
was
killed
here
by
the
indians
issuing
from
the
pines
in
the
afternoon
we
saw
spread
out
before
us
the
valley
of
the
platte
with
the
pass
of
the
medicine
butte
beyond
and
some
of
the
sweet
water
mountains
but
a
smoky
haziness
in
the
air
entirely
obscured
the
wind
river
chain
we
were
now
about
two
degrees
south
of
the
south
pass
and
our
course
home
would
have
been
eastwardly
but
that
would
have
taken
us
over
ground
already
examined
and
therefore
without
the
interest
that
would
excite
curiosity
southwardly
there
were
objects
worthy
to
be
explored
to
wit
the
approximation
of
the
of
three
different
rivers
the
platte
the
arkansas
and
the
grand
river
fork
of
the
rio
colorado
of
the
gulf
of
california
the
passages
at
the
heads
of
these
rivers
and
the
three
remarkable
mountain
coves
called
parks
in
which
they
took
their
rise
one
of
these
parks
was
of
course
on
the
western
side
of
the
dividing
ridge
and
a
visit
to
it
would
once
more
require
us
to
cross
the
summit
of
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
west
and
then
to
recross
to
the
east
making
in
all
with
the
transit
we
had
just
accomplished
three
crossings
of
that
mountain
in
this
section
of
its
course
but
no
matter
the
coves
the
heads
of
the
rivers
the
approximation
of
their
waters
the
practicability
of
the
mountain
passes
and
the
locality
of
the
three
parks
were
all
objects
of
interest
and
although
well
known
to
hunters
and
trappers
were
unknown
to
science
and
to
history
we
therefore
changed
our
course
and
turned
up
the
valley
of
the
platte
instead
of
going
down
it
we
crossed
several
small
affluents
and
again
made
a
fortified
camp
in
a
grove
the
country
had
now
became
very
beautiful
rich
in
water
grass
and
game
and
to
these
were
added
the
charm
of
scenery
and
pleasant
weather
our
route
this
morning
lay
along
the
foot
of
the
mountain
over
the
long
low
spurs
which
sloped
gradually
down
to
the
river
forming
the
broad
valley
of
the
platte
the
country
is
beautifully
watered
in
almost
every
hollow
ran
a
clear
cool
mountain
stream
and
in
the
course
of
the
morning
we
crossed
seventeen
several
of
them
being
large
creeks
forty
to
fifty
feet
wide
with
a
swift
current
and
tolerably
deep
these
were
variously
wooded
with
groves
of
aspen
and
cottonwood
with
willow
cherry
and
other
shrubby
trees
buffalo
antelope
and
elk
were
frequent
during
the
day
and
in
their
abundance
the
latter
sometimes
reminded
us
slightly
of
the
sacramento
valley
we
halted
at
noon
on
potter
fork
a
clear
and
swift
stream
forty
yards
wide
and
in
many
places
deep
enough
to
swim
our
animals
and
in
the
evening
encamped
on
a
pretty
stream
where
there
were
several
beaver
dams
and
many
trees
recently
cut
down
by
the
beaver
we
gave
to
this
the
name
of
beaver
dam
creek
as
now
they
are
becoming
sufficiently
rare
to
distinguish
by
their
names
the
streams
on
which
they
are
found
in
this
mountain
they
occurred
more
abundantly
than
elsewhere
in
all
our
journey
in
which
their
vestiges
had
been
scarcely
seen
the
next
day
we
continued
our
journey
up
the
valley
the
country
presenting
much
the
same
appearance
except
that
the
grass
was
more
scanty
on
the
ridges
over
which
was
spread
a
scrubby
growth
of
sage
but
still
the
bottoms
of
the
creeks
were
broad
and
afforded
good
we
had
an
animated
chase
after
a
grizzly
bear
this
morning
which
we
tried
to
lasso
fuentes
threw
the
lasso
upon
his
neck
but
it
slipped
off
and
he
escaped
into
the
dense
thickets
of
the
creek
into
which
we
did
not
like
to
venture
our
course
in
the
afternoon
brought
us
to
the
main
platte
river
here
a
handsome
stream
with
a
uniform
breadth
of
seventy
yards
except
where
widened
by
frequent
islands
it
was
apparently
deep
with
a
moderate
current
and
wooded
with
groves
of
large
willow
the
valley
narrowed
as
we
ascended
and
presently
degenerated
into
a
gorge
through
which
the
river
passed
as
through
a
gate
we
entered
it
and
found
ourselves
in
the
new
park
a
beautiful
circular
valley
of
thirty
miles
diameter
walled
in
all
round
with
snowy
mountains
rich
with
water
and
with
grass
fringed
with
pine
on
the
mountain
sides
below
the
snow
line
and
a
paradise
to
all
grazing
animals
the
indian
name
for
it
signifies
cow
lodge
of
which
our
own
may
be
considered
a
translation
the
enclosure
the
grass
the
water
and
the
herds
of
buffalo
roaming
over
it
naturally
presenting
the
idea
of
a
park
we
halted
for
the
night
just
within
the
gate
and
expected
as
usual
to
see
herds
of
buffalo
but
an
arapahoe
village
had
been
before
us
and
not
one
was
to
be
seen
latitude
of
the
encampment
elevation
by
the
boiling
point
feet
it
is
from
this
elevated
cove
and
from
the
gorges
of
the
surrounding
mountains
and
some
lakes
within
their
bosoms
that
the
great
platte
river
collects
its
first
waters
and
assumes
its
first
form
and
certainly
no
river
could
ask
a
more
beautiful
origin
in
the
morning
we
pursued
our
way
through
the
park
following
a
principal
branch
of
the
platte
and
crossing
among
many
smaller
ones
a
bold
stream
scarcely
fordable
called
lodge
pole
fork
and
which
issues
from
a
lake
in
the
mountains
on
the
right
ten
miles
long
in
the
evening
we
encamped
on
a
small
stream
near
the
upper
end
of
the
park
latitude
of
the
camp
we
continued
our
way
among
the
waters
of
the
park
over
the
of
the
bordering
mountains
where
we
found
good
pasturage
and
surprised
and
killed
some
buffalo
we
fell
into
a
broad
and
excellent
trail
made
by
buffalo
where
a
wagon
would
pass
with
ease
and
in
the
course
of
the
morning
we
crossed
the
summit
of
the
rocky
mountains
through
a
pass
which
was
one
of
the
most
beautiful
we
had
ever
seen
the
trail
led
among
the
aspens
through
open
grounds
richly
covered
with
grass
and
carried
us
over
an
elevation
of
about
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
the
country
appeared
to
great
advantage
in
the
delightful
summer
weather
of
the
mountains
which
we
still
continued
to
enjoy
descending
from
the
pass
we
found
ourselves
again
on
the
western
waters
and
halted
to
noon
on
the
edge
of
another
mountain
valley
called
the
old
park
in
which
is
formed
grand
river
one
of
the
principal
branches
of
the
colorado
of
california
we
were
now
moving
with
some
caution
as
from
the
trail
we
found
the
arapahoe
village
had
also
passed
this
way
as
we
were
coming
out
of
their
enemy
country
and
this
was
a
we
were
desirous
to
avoid
them
after
a
long
march
we
halted
at
night
on
a
small
creek
tributary
to
a
main
fork
of
grand
river
which
ran
through
this
portion
of
the
valley
the
appearance
of
the
country
in
the
old
park
is
interesting
though
of
a
different
character
from
the
new
instead
of
being
a
comparative
plain
it
is
more
or
less
broken
into
hills
and
surrounded
by
the
high
mountains
timbered
on
the
lower
parts
with
quaking
asp
and
pines
our
scouts
who
were
as
usual
ahead
made
from
a
this
morning
the
signal
of
indians
and
we
rode
up
in
time
to
meet
a
party
of
about
arapahoes
they
were
men
and
women
going
into
the
hills
the
men
for
game
the
women
for
roots
and
informed
us
that
the
village
was
encamped
a
few
miles
above
on
the
main
fork
of
grand
river
which
passes
through
the
midst
of
the
valley
i
made
them
the
usual
presents
but
they
appeared
disposed
to
be
unfriendly
and
galloped
back
at
speed
to
the
village
knowing
that
we
had
trouble
to
expect
i
descended
immediately
into
the
bottoms
of
grand
river
which
were
overflowed
in
places
the
river
being
up
and
made
the
best
encampment
the
ground
afforded
we
had
no
time
to
build
a
fort
but
found
an
open
place
among
the
willows
which
was
defended
by
the
river
on
one
side
and
the
overflowed
bottoms
on
the
other
we
had
scarcely
made
our
few
preparations
when
about
of
them
appeared
on
the
verge
of
the
bottom
mounted
painted
and
armed
for
war
we
planted
the
american
flag
between
us
and
a
short
parley
ended
in
a
truce
with
something
more
than
the
usual
amount
of
presents
about
sioux
were
with
them
one
of
them
an
old
chief
who
had
always
been
friendly
to
the
whites
he
informed
me
that
before
coming
down
a
council
had
been
held
at
the
village
in
which
the
greater
part
had
declared
for
attacking
us
we
had
come
from
their
enemies
to
whom
we
had
doubtless
been
carrying
assistance
in
arms
and
ammunition
but
his
own
party
with
some
few
of
the
arapahoes
who
had
seen
us
the
previous
year
in
the
plains
opposed
it
it
will
be
remembered
that
it
is
customary
for
this
people
to
attack
the
trading
parties
which
they
meet
in
this
region
considering
all
whom
they
meet
on
the
western
side
of
the
mountains
to
be
their
enemies
they
deceived
me
into
the
belief
that
i
should
find
a
ford
at
their
village
and
i
could
not
avoid
accompanying
them
but
put
several
sloughs
between
us
and
their
village
and
forted
strongly
on
the
banks
of
the
river
which
was
everywhere
rapid
and
deep
and
over
a
hundred
yards
in
breadth
the
camp
was
generally
crowded
with
indians
and
though
the
baggage
was
carefully
watched
and
covered
a
number
of
things
were
stolen
the
next
morning
we
descended
the
river
for
about
eight
miles
and
halted
a
short
distance
above
a
canon
through
which
grand
river
issues
from
the
park
here
it
was
smooth
and
deep
yards
in
breadth
and
its
elevation
at
this
point
feet
a
frame
for
the
boat
being
very
soon
made
our
baggage
was
ferried
across
the
horses
in
the
mean
time
swimming
over
a
southern
fork
of
grand
river
here
makes
its
junction
nearly
opposite
to
the
branch
by
which
we
had
entered
the
valley
and
up
this
we
continued
for
about
eight
miles
in
the
afternoon
and
encamped
in
a
bottom
on
the
left
bank
which
afforded
good
grass
at
our
encampment
it
was
to
yards
in
breadth
sometimes
widened
by
islands
and
separated
into
several
channels
with
a
very
swift
current
and
bed
of
rolled
rocks
on
the
we
traveled
up
the
left
bank
with
the
prospect
of
a
bad
road
the
trail
here
taking
the
opposite
side
but
the
stream
was
up
and
nowhere
fordable
a
piny
ridge
of
mountains
with
bare
rocky
peaks
was
on
our
right
all
the
day
and
a
snowy
mountain
appeared
ahead
we
crossed
many
foaming
torrents
with
rocky
beds
rushing
down
the
river
and
in
the
evening
made
a
strong
fort
in
an
aspen
grove
the
valley
had
already
become
very
narrow
shut
up
more
closely
in
densely
timbered
mountains
the
pines
sweeping
down
the
verge
of
the
bottoms
the
de
prairie
tetrao
europhasianus
was
occasionally
seen
among
the
sage
we
saw
the
returning
trail
of
an
arapahoe
party
which
had
been
sent
from
the
village
to
look
for
utahs
in
the
bayou
salade
south
park
and
it
being
probable
that
they
would
visit
our
camp
with
the
desire
to
return
on
horseback
we
were
more
than
usually
on
the
alert
here
the
river
diminished
to
yards
and
notwithstanding
the
number
of
affluents
we
had
crossed
was
still
a
large
stream
dashing
swiftly
by
with
a
great
continuous
fall
and
not
yet
fordable
we
had
a
delightful
ride
along
a
good
trail
among
the
fragrant
pines
and
the
appearance
of
buffalo
in
great
numbers
indicated
that
there
were
indians
in
the
bayou
salade
south
park
by
whom
they
were
driven
out
we
halted
to
noon
under
the
shade
of
the
pines
and
the
weather
was
most
delightful
the
country
was
literally
alive
with
buffalo
and
the
continued
echo
of
the
hunters
rifles
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
for
a
moment
made
me
uneasy
thinking
perhaps
they
were
engaged
with
indians
but
in
a
short
time
they
came
into
camp
with
the
meat
of
seven
fat
cows
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
ride
the
river
had
been
merely
a
narrow
ravine
between
high
piny
mountains
backed
on
both
sides
but
particularly
on
the
west
by
a
line
of
snowy
ridges
but
after
several
hours
ride
the
stream
opened
out
into
a
valley
with
pleasant
bottoms
in
the
afternoon
the
river
forked
into
three
apparently
equal
streams
broad
buffalo
trails
leading
up
the
left
hand
and
the
middle
branch
indicating
good
passes
over
the
mountains
but
up
the
branch
which
in
the
object
of
descending
from
the
mountain
by
the
main
head
of
the
arkansas
i
was
most
desirous
to
follow
there
was
no
sign
of
a
buffalo
trace
apprehending
from
this
reason
and
the
character
of
the
mountains
which
are
known
to
be
extremely
rugged
that
the
branch
led
to
no
pass
i
proceeded
up
the
middle
branch
which
formed
a
flat
between
timbered
ridges
on
the
left
and
snowy
mountains
on
the
right
terminating
in
large
of
naked
rock
the
trail
was
good
and
the
country
interesting
and
at
nightfall
we
encamped
in
an
open
place
among
the
pines
where
we
built
a
strong
fort
the
mountains
exhibit
their
usual
varied
growth
of
flowers
and
at
this
place
i
noticed
among
others
whose
bright
yellow
color
makes
it
a
showy
plant
this
has
been
a
characteristic
in
many
parts
of
the
country
since
reaching
the
uintah
waters
with
fields
of
iris
were
violets
esparcette
and
strawberries
at
dark
we
perceived
a
fire
in
the
edge
of
the
pines
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
we
had
evidently
not
been
discovered
and
at
the
report
of
a
gun
and
the
blaze
of
fresh
fuel
which
was
heaped
on
our
fires
those
of
the
strangers
were
instantly
extinguished
in
the
morning
they
were
found
to
be
a
party
of
six
trappers
who
had
ventured
out
among
the
mountains
after
beaver
they
informed
us
that
two
of
the
number
with
which
they
had
started
had
been
already
killed
by
the
indians
one
of
them
but
a
few
days
since
by
the
arapahoes
we
had
lately
seen
who
had
found
him
alone
at
a
camp
on
this
river
and
carried
off
his
traps
and
animals
as
they
were
desirous
to
join
us
the
hunters
returned
with
them
to
the
encampment
and
we
continued
up
the
valley
in
which
the
stream
rapidly
diminished
breaking
into
small
tributaries
every
hollow
affording
water
at
our
noon
halt
the
hunters
joined
us
with
the
trappers
while
preparing
to
start
from
their
encampment
they
found
themselves
suddenly
surrounded
by
a
party
of
arapahoes
who
informed
them
that
their
scouts
had
discovered
a
large
utah
village
in
the
bayou
salade
south
park
and
that
a
large
consisting
of
almost
every
man
in
the
village
except
those
who
were
too
old
to
go
to
war
were
going
over
to
attack
them
the
main
body
had
ascended
the
left
fork
of
the
river
which
afforded
a
better
pass
than
the
branch
we
were
on
and
this
party
had
followed
our
trail
in
order
that
we
might
add
our
force
to
theirs
carson
informed
them
that
we
were
too
far
ahead
to
turn
back
but
would
join
them
in
the
bayou
and
the
indians
went
off
apparently
satisfied
by
the
temperature
of
boiling
water
our
elevation
here
was
feet
and
still
the
pine
forest
continued
and
grass
was
good
in
the
afternoon
we
continued
our
road
occasionally
through
open
pines
with
a
very
gradual
ascent
we
surprised
a
herd
of
buffalo
enjoying
the
shade
at
a
small
lake
among
the
pines
and
they
made
the
dry
branches
crack
as
they
broke
through
the
woods
in
a
ride
of
about
of
an
hour
and
having
ascended
perhaps
feet
we
reached
the
of
the
dividing
which
would
thus
have
an
estimated
height
of
feet
here
the
river
spreads
itself
into
small
branches
and
springs
heading
nearly
in
the
summit
of
the
ridge
which
is
very
narrow
immediately
below
us
was
a
green
valley
through
which
ran
a
stream
and
a
short
distance
opposite
rose
snowy
mountains
whose
summits
were
formed
into
peaks
of
naked
rock
we
soon
afterwards
satisfied
ourselves
that
immediately
beyond
these
mountains
was
the
main
branch
of
the
arkansas
river
most
probably
heading
directly
with
the
little
stream
below
us
which
gathered
its
waters
in
the
snowy
mountains
near
by
descriptions
of
the
rugged
character
of
the
mountains
around
the
head
of
the
arkansas
which
their
appearance
amply
justified
deterred
me
from
making
any
attempt
to
reach
it
which
would
have
involved
a
greater
length
of
time
than
now
remained
at
my
disposal
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
descended
from
the
summit
of
the
pass
into
the
creek
below
our
road
having
been
very
much
controlled
and
interrupted
by
the
pines
and
springs
on
the
turning
up
the
stream
we
encamped
on
a
bottom
of
good
grass
near
its
head
which
gathers
its
waters
in
the
dividing
crest
of
the
rocky
mountains
and
according
to
the
best
information
we
could
obtain
separated
only
by
the
rocky
wall
of
the
ridge
from
the
head
of
the
main
arkansas
river
by
the
observations
of
the
evening
the
latitude
of
our
encampment
was
and
south
of
which
therefore
is
the
head
of
the
arkansas
river
the
stream
on
which
we
had
encamped
is
the
head
of
either
the
a
branch
of
the
arkansas
or
the
remotest
head
of
the
south
fork
of
the
platte
as
which
you
will
find
it
laid
down
on
the
map
but
descending
it
only
through
a
portion
of
its
course
we
have
not
been
able
to
settle
this
point
satisfactorily
in
the
evening
a
band
of
buffalo
furnished
a
little
excitement
by
charging
through
the
camp
on
the
following
day
we
descended
the
stream
by
an
excellent
along
the
open
grassy
bottom
of
the
river
on
our
right
the
bayou
was
bordered
by
a
mountainous
range
crested
with
rocky
and
naked
peaks
and
below
it
had
a
beautiful
character
of
pretty
level
prairies
interspersed
among
low
spurs
wooded
openly
with
pine
and
quaking
asp
contrasting
well
with
the
denser
pines
which
swept
around
on
the
mountain
sides
descending
always
the
valley
of
the
stream
towards
noon
we
descried
a
mounted
party
descending
the
point
of
a
spur
and
judging
them
to
be
arapahoes
who
defeated
or
victorious
were
equally
dangerous
to
us
and
with
whom
a
fight
would
be
inevitable
we
hurried
to
post
ourselves
as
strongly
as
possible
on
some
willow
islands
in
the
river
we
had
scarcely
halted
when
they
arrived
proving
to
be
a
party
of
utah
women
who
told
us
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
their
village
was
fighting
with
the
arapahoes
as
soon
as
they
had
given
us
this
information
they
filled
the
air
with
cries
and
lamentations
which
made
us
understand
that
some
of
their
chiefs
had
been
killed
extending
along
the
river
directly
ahead
of
us
was
a
low
piny
ridge
leaving
between
it
and
the
stream
a
small
open
bottom
on
which
the
utahs
had
very
injudiciously
placed
their
village
which
according
to
the
women
numbered
about
warriors
advancing
in
the
cover
of
the
pines
the
arapahoes
about
daylight
charged
into
the
village
driving
off
a
great
number
of
their
horses
and
killing
four
men
among
them
the
principal
chief
of
the
village
they
drove
the
horses
perhaps
a
mile
beyond
the
village
to
the
end
of
a
hollow
where
they
had
previously
forted
at
the
edge
of
the
pines
here
the
utahs
had
instantly
attacked
them
in
turn
and
according
to
the
report
of
the
women
were
getting
rather
the
best
of
the
day
the
women
pressed
us
eagerly
to
join
with
their
people
and
would
immediately
have
provided
us
with
the
best
horses
at
the
village
but
it
was
not
for
us
to
interfere
in
such
a
conflict
neither
party
were
our
friends
or
under
our
protection
and
each
was
ready
to
prey
upon
us
that
could
but
we
could
not
help
feeling
an
unusual
excitement
at
being
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
a
fight
in
which
men
were
closely
engaged
and
hearing
the
sharp
cracks
of
their
rifles
we
were
in
a
bad
position
and
subject
to
be
attacked
in
it
either
party
which
we
might
meet
victorious
or
defeated
was
certain
to
fall
upon
us
and
gearing
up
immediately
we
kept
close
along
the
pines
of
the
ridge
having
it
between
us
and
the
village
and
keeping
the
scouts
on
the
summit
to
give
us
notice
of
the
approach
of
indians
as
we
passed
by
the
village
which
was
immediately
below
us
horsemen
were
galloping
to
and
fro
and
groups
of
people
were
gathered
around
those
who
were
wounded
and
dead
and
who
were
being
brought
in
from
the
field
we
continued
to
press
on
and
crossing
another
fork
which
came
in
from
the
right
after
having
made
fifteen
miles
from
the
village
fortified
ourselves
strongly
in
the
pines
a
short
distance
from
the
river
during
the
afternoon
pike
peak
had
been
plainly
in
view
before
us
and
from
our
encampment
bore
by
compass
this
was
a
familiar
object
and
it
had
for
us
the
face
of
an
old
friend
at
its
foot
were
the
springs
where
we
had
spent
a
pleasant
day
in
coming
out
near
it
were
the
habitations
of
civilized
men
and
it
overlooked
the
broad
smooth
plains
which
promised
us
an
easy
journey
to
our
home
the
next
day
we
left
the
river
which
continued
its
course
towards
pike
peak
and
taking
a
southeasterly
direction
in
about
ten
miles
we
crossed
a
gentle
ridge
and
issuing
from
the
south
park
found
ourselves
involved
among
the
broken
spurs
of
the
mountains
which
border
the
great
prairie
plains
although
broken
and
extremely
rugged
the
country
was
very
interesting
being
well
watered
by
numerous
affluents
to
the
arkansas
river
and
covered
with
grass
and
a
variety
of
trees
the
streams
which
in
the
upper
part
of
their
course
ran
through
grassy
and
open
hollows
after
a
few
miles
all
descended
into
deep
and
impracticable
canons
through
which
they
found
their
way
to
the
arkansas
valley
here
the
buffalo
trails
we
had
followed
were
dispersed
among
the
hills
or
crossed
over
into
the
more
open
valleys
of
other
streams
during
the
day
our
road
was
fatiguing
and
difficult
reminding
us
much
by
its
steep
and
rocky
character
of
our
traveling
the
year
before
among
the
wind
river
mountains
but
always
at
night
we
found
some
grassy
bottom
which
afforded
us
a
pleasant
camp
in
the
deep
seclusion
of
these
little
streams
we
found
always
an
abundant
pasturage
and
a
wild
luxuriance
of
plants
and
trees
aspens
and
pines
were
the
prevailing
timber
on
the
creeks
oak
was
frequent
but
the
cottonwood
of
unusually
large
size
and
seven
or
eight
feet
in
circumference
was
the
principal
tree
with
these
were
mingled
a
variety
of
shrubby
trees
which
aided
to
make
the
ravines
almost
impenetrable
after
several
days
laborious
traveling
we
succeeded
in
extricating
ourselves
from
the
mountains
and
on
the
morning
of
the
encamped
immediately
at
their
foot
on
a
handsome
tributary
to
the
arkansas
river
in
the
afternoon
we
descended
the
stream
winding
our
way
along
the
bottoms
which
were
densely
wooded
with
oak
and
in
the
evening
encamped
near
the
main
river
continuing
the
next
day
our
road
along
the
arkansas
and
meeting
on
the
way
a
of
arapahoe
indians
who
had
recently
been
committing
some
outrages
at
bent
fort
killing
stock
and
driving
off
horses
we
arrived
before
sunset
at
the
pueblo
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
where
we
had
the
pleasure
to
find
a
number
of
our
old
acquaintances
the
little
settlement
appeared
in
a
thriving
condition
and
in
the
interval
of
our
absence
another
had
been
established
on
the
river
some
thirty
miles
above
on
the
of
june
our
cavalcade
moved
rapidly
down
the
arkansas
along
the
broad
road
which
follows
the
river
july
on
the
of
july
we
arrived
at
bent
fort
about
miles
below
the
mouth
of
the
as
we
emerged
into
view
from
the
groves
on
the
river
we
were
saluted
with
a
display
of
the
national
flag
and
repeated
discharges
from
the
guns
of
the
fort
where
we
were
received
by
george
bent
with
a
cordial
welcome
and
a
friendly
hospitality
in
the
enjoyment
of
which
we
spent
several
very
agreeable
days
we
were
now
in
the
region
where
our
mountaineers
were
accustomed
to
live
and
all
the
dangers
and
difficulties
of
the
road
being
considered
past
four
of
them
including
carson
and
walker
remained
at
the
fort
on
the
we
resumed
our
journey
down
the
arkansas
traveling
along
a
broad
and
encamped
about
miles
below
the
fort
on
the
way
we
met
a
very
large
village
of
sioux
and
cheyenne
indians
who
with
the
arapahoes
were
returning
from
the
crossing
of
the
arkansas
where
they
had
been
to
meet
the
kioway
and
camanche
indians
a
few
days
previous
they
had
massacred
a
party
of
fifteen
delawares
whom
they
had
discovered
in
a
fort
on
the
smoky
hill
river
losing
in
the
affair
several
of
their
own
people
they
were
desirous
that
we
should
bear
a
pacific
message
to
the
delawares
on
the
frontier
from
whom
they
expected
retaliation
and
we
passed
through
them
without
any
difficulty
or
delay
dispersed
over
the
plain
in
scattered
bodies
of
horsemen
and
family
groups
of
women
and
children
with
carrying
baggage
and
long
lines
of
their
appearance
was
picturesque
and
imposing
agreeably
to
your
instructions
which
required
me
to
complete
as
far
as
practicable
our
examinations
of
the
kansas
i
left
at
this
encampment
the
arkansas
river
taking
a
northeasterly
direction
across
the
elevated
dividing
grounds
which
separate
that
river
from
the
waters
of
the
platte
on
the
we
crossed
a
large
stream
about
forty
yards
wide
and
one
or
two
feet
deep
flowing
with
a
lively
current
on
a
sandy
bed
the
discolored
and
muddy
appearance
of
the
water
indicated
that
it
proceeded
from
recent
rains
and
we
are
inclined
to
consider
this
a
branch
of
the
smoky
hill
river
although
possibly
it
may
be
the
pawnee
fork
of
the
arkansas
beyond
this
stream
we
traveled
over
high
and
level
prairies
halting
at
small
ponds
and
holes
of
water
and
using
for
our
fires
the
de
the
country
being
without
timber
on
the
evening
of
the
we
encamped
in
a
cottonwood
grove
on
the
banks
of
a
sandy
where
there
was
water
in
holes
sufficient
for
the
camp
here
several
hollows
or
dry
creeks
with
sandy
beds
met
together
forming
the
head
of
a
stream
which
afterwards
proved
to
be
the
smoky
hill
fork
of
the
kansas
river
the
next
morning
as
we
were
leaving
our
encampment
a
number
of
arapahoe
indians
were
discovered
they
belonged
to
a
which
had
scattered
over
the
prairie
in
returning
from
an
expedition
against
the
pawnees
as
we
traveled
down
the
valley
water
gathered
rapidly
in
the
sandy
bed
from
many
little
tributaries
and
at
evening
it
had
become
a
handsome
stream
fifty
to
eighty
feet
in
width
with
a
lively
current
in
small
channels
the
water
being
principally
dispersed
among
quicksands
gradually
enlarging
in
a
few
days
march
it
became
a
river
eighty
yards
in
breadth
wooded
with
occasional
groves
of
cottonwood
our
road
was
generally
over
level
uplands
bordering
the
river
which
were
closely
covered
with
a
sward
of
on
the
we
entered
again
the
buffalo
range
where
we
had
found
these
animals
so
abundant
on
our
outward
journey
and
halted
for
a
day
among
numerous
herds
in
order
to
make
a
provision
of
meat
sufficient
to
carry
us
to
the
frontier
a
few
days
afterwards
we
encamped
in
a
pleasant
evening
on
a
high
river
prairie
the
stream
being
less
than
a
hundred
yards
broad
during
the
night
we
had
a
succession
of
with
heavy
and
continuous
rain
and
towards
morning
the
water
suddenly
burst
over
the
bank
flooding
the
bottoms
and
becoming
a
large
river
five
or
six
hundred
yards
in
breadth
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
incessant
rain
had
concealed
from
the
guard
the
rise
of
the
water
and
the
river
broke
into
the
camp
so
suddenly
that
the
baggage
was
instantly
covered
and
all
our
perishable
collections
almost
entirely
ruined
and
the
hard
labor
of
many
months
destroyed
in
a
moment
on
the
we
discovered
a
large
village
of
indians
encamped
at
the
mouth
of
a
handsomely
wooded
stream
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
readily
inferring
from
the
nature
of
the
encampment
that
they
were
pawnee
indians
and
confidently
expecting
good
treatment
from
a
people
who
receive
regularly
an
annuity
from
the
government
we
proceeded
directly
to
the
village
where
we
found
assembled
nearly
all
the
pawnee
tribe
who
were
now
returning
from
the
crossing
of
the
arkansas
where
they
had
met
the
kioway
and
camanche
indians
we
were
received
by
them
with
the
unfriendly
rudeness
and
characteristic
insolence
which
they
never
fail
to
display
whenever
they
find
an
occasion
for
doing
so
with
impunity
the
little
that
remained
of
our
goods
was
distributed
among
them
but
proved
entirely
insufficient
to
satisfy
their
greedy
rapacity
and
after
some
delay
and
considerable
difficulty
we
succeeded
in
extricating
ourselves
from
the
village
and
encamped
on
the
river
about
miles
below
footnote
in
a
recent
report
to
the
department
from
major
wharton
who
visited
the
pawnee
villages
with
a
military
force
some
months
afterwards
it
is
stated
that
the
indians
had
intended
to
attack
our
party
during
the
night
we
remained
at
this
encampment
but
were
prevented
by
the
interposition
of
the
pawnee
loups
the
country
through
which
we
had
been
traveling
since
leaving
the
arkansas
river
for
a
distance
of
miles
presented
to
the
eye
only
a
succession
of
green
prairies
covered
with
the
unbroken
verdure
of
the
and
sparingly
wooded
along
the
streams
with
straggling
trees
and
occasional
groves
of
cottonwood
but
here
the
country
began
perceptibly
to
change
its
character
becoming
a
more
fertile
wooded
and
beautiful
region
covered
with
a
profusion
of
grasses
and
watered
with
innumerable
little
streams
which
were
wooded
with
oak
large
elms
and
the
usual
varieties
of
timber
common
to
the
lower
course
of
the
kansas
river
as
we
advanced
the
country
steadily
improved
gradually
assimilating
itself
in
appearance
to
the
northwestern
part
of
the
state
of
missouri
the
beautiful
sward
of
the
which
is
regarded
as
the
best
and
most
nutritious
found
on
the
prairies
appeared
now
only
in
patches
being
replaced
by
a
longer
and
coarser
grass
which
covered
the
face
of
the
country
luxuriantly
the
difference
in
the
character
of
the
grasses
became
suddenly
evident
in
the
weakened
condition
of
our
animals
which
began
sensibly
to
fail
as
soon
as
we
quitted
the
the
river
preserved
a
uniform
breadth
of
eighty
or
a
hundred
yards
with
broad
bottoms
continuously
timbered
with
large
among
which
were
interspersed
a
few
other
varieties
while
engaged
in
crossing
one
of
the
numerous
creeks
which
frequently
impeded
and
checked
our
way
sometimes
obliging
us
to
ascend
them
for
several
miles
one
of
the
people
alexis
ayot
was
shot
through
the
leg
by
the
accidental
discharge
of
a
rifle
a
mortifying
and
painful
mischance
to
be
crippled
for
life
by
an
accident
after
having
nearly
accomplished
in
safety
a
long
and
eventful
journey
he
was
a
young
man
of
remarkably
good
and
cheerful
temper
and
had
been
among
the
useful
and
efficient
men
of
the
party
after
having
traveled
directly
along
its
banks
for
miles
we
left
the
river
where
it
bore
suddenly
off
in
a
northwesterly
direction
towards
its
junction
with
the
republican
fork
of
the
kansas
distant
about
miles
and
continuing
our
easterly
course
in
about
miles
we
entered
the
from
santa
fé
to
independence
and
on
the
last
day
of
july
encamped
again
at
the
little
town
of
kansas
on
the
banks
of
the
missouri
river
during
our
protracted
absence
of
months
in
the
course
of
which
we
had
necessarily
been
exposed
to
great
varieties
of
weather
and
of
climate
not
one
case
of
sickness
had
ever
occurred
among
us
here
ended
our
land
journey
and
the
day
following
our
arrival
we
found
ourselves
on
board
a
steamboat
rapidly
gliding
down
the
broad
missouri
our
animals
had
not
been
sold
and
dispersed
over
the
country
to
renewed
labor
but
were
placed
at
good
pasturage
on
the
frontier
and
are
now
ready
to
do
their
part
in
the
coming
expedition
on
the
of

mills
were
lying
idle
fields
of
wheat
were
open
to
cattle
and
horses
houses
vacant
and
farms
going
to
waste
at
sutter
there
was
more
life
and
business
launches
were
discharging
their
cargoes
at
the
river
and
carts
were
hauling
goods
to
the
fort
where
already
were
established
several
stores
a
hotel
captain
sutter
had
only
two
mechanics
in
his
employ
a
and
a
blacksmith
whom
he
was
then
paying
ten
dollars
a
day
merchants
pay
him
a
monthly
rent
of
per
room
and
while
i
was
there
a
house
in
the
fort
was
rented
as
a
hotel
for
a
month
at
the
urgent
solicitation
of
many
gentlemen
i
delayed
there
to
participate
in
the
first
public
celebration
of
our
national
anniversary
at
that
fort
but
on
the
resumed
the
journey
and
proceeded
miles
up
the
american
fork
to
a
point
on
it
now
known
as
the
lower
mines
or
mormon
diggings
the
were
thickly
strewn
with
canvas
tents
and
bush
arbors
a
store
was
erected
and
several
boarding
shanties
in
operation
the
day
was
intensely
hot
yet
about
two
hundred
men
were
at
work
in
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
washing
for
gold
some
with
tin
pans
some
with
indian
baskets
but
the
greater
part
had
a
rude
machine
known
as
the
cradle
this
is
on
rockers
six
or
eight
feet
long
open
at
the
foot
and
at
its
head
has
a
coarse
grate
or
sieve
the
bottom
is
rounded
with
small
cleets
nailed
across
four
men
are
required
to
work
this
machine
one
digs
the
ground
in
the
bank
close
by
the
stream
another
carries
it
to
the
cradle
and
empties
it
on
the
grate
a
third
gives
a
violent
rocking
motion
to
the
machine
while
a
fourth
dashes
on
water
from
the
stream
itself
the
sieve
keeps
the
coarse
stones
from
entering
the
cradle
the
current
of
water
washes
off
the
earthy
matter
and
the
gravel
is
gradually
carried
out
at
the
foot
of
the
machine
leaving
the
gold
mixed
with
a
heavy
fine
black
sand
above
the
first
cleets
the
sand
and
gold
mixed
together
are
then
drawn
off
through
auger
holes
into
a
pan
below
are
dried
in
the
sun
and
afterwards
separated
by
blowing
off
the
sand
a
party
of
four
men
thus
employed
at
the
lower
mines
averaged
a
day
the
indians
and
those
who
have
nothing
but
pans
or
willow
baskets
gradually
wash
out
the
earth
and
separate
the
gravel
by
hand
leaving
nothing
but
the
gold
mixed
with
sand
which
is
separated
in
the
manner
before
described
the
gold
in
the
lower
mines
is
in
fine
bright
scales
of
which
i
send
several
specimens
as
we
ascended
the
north
branch
of
the
american
fork
the
country
became
more
broken
and
mountainous
and
at
the
miles
above
the
lower
washings
or
miles
from
sutter
the
hills
rise
to
about
a
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sacramento
plain
here
a
species
of
pine
occurs
which
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
gold
capt
sutter
feeling
the
great
want
of
lumber
contracted
in
september
last
with
a
marshall
to
build
a
at
that
place
it
was
erected
in
the
course
of
the
past
winter
and
spring
a
dam
and
race
constructed
but
when
the
water
was
let
on
the
wheel
the
was
found
to
be
too
narrow
to
permit
the
water
to
escape
with
sufficient
rapidity
marshall
to
save
labor
let
the
water
directly
into
the
race
with
a
strong
current
so
as
to
wash
it
wider
and
deeper
he
effected
his
purpose
and
a
large
bed
of
mud
and
gravel
was
carried
to
the
foot
of
the
race
one
day
marshall
as
he
was
walking
down
the
race
to
this
deposit
of
mud
observed
some
glittering
particles
at
its
upper
edge
he
gathered
a
few
examined
them
and
became
satisfied
of
their
value
he
then
went
to
the
fort
told
capt
sutter
of
his
discovery
and
they
agreed
to
keep
it
secret
until
a
certain
of
sutter
was
finished
it
however
got
out
and
spread
like
magic
remarkable
success
attended
the
labors
of
the
first
explorers
and
in
a
few
weeks
hundreds
of
men
were
drawn
thither
at
the
time
of
my
visit
but
little
over
three
months
after
the
first
discovery
it
was
estimated
that
upwards
of
four
thousand
people
were
employed
at
the
mill
there
is
a
fine
deposit
or
bank
of
gravel
which
the
people
respect
as
the
property
of
captain
sutter
although
he
pretends
to
no
right
to
it
and
would
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
simple
promise
of
a
on
account
of
the
mill
which
he
has
built
there
at
considerable
cost
marshall
was
living
near
the
mill
and
informed
me
that
many
persons
were
employed
above
and
below
him
that
they
used
the
same
machines
at
the
lower
washings
and
that
their
success
was
about
the
same
ranging
from
one
to
three
ounces
of
gold
per
man
daily
this
gold
too
is
in
scales
a
little
coarser
than
those
of
the
lower
mines
from
the
mill
marshall
guided
me
up
the
mountain
on
the
opposite
or
north
bank
of
the
south
fork
where
in
the
bed
of
small
streams
or
ravines
now
dry
a
great
deal
of
coarse
gold
has
been
found
i
there
saw
several
parties
at
work
all
of
whom
were
doing
very
well
a
great
many
specimens
were
shown
me
some
as
heavy
as
four
or
five
ounces
in
weight
and
i
send
three
pieces
labelled
no
presented
by
a
spence
you
will
perceive
that
some
of
the
specimens
accompanying
this
hold
mechanically
pieces
of
quartz
that
the
surface
is
rough
and
evidently
moulded
in
the
crevice
of
a
rock
this
gold
can
not
have
been
carried
far
by
water
but
must
have
remained
near
where
it
was
first
deposited
from
the
rock
that
once
bound
it
i
inquired
of
many
people
if
they
had
encountered
the
metal
in
its
matrix
but
in
every
instance
they
said
they
had
not
but
that
the
gold
was
invariably
mixed
with
washed
gravel
or
lodged
in
the
crevices
of
other
rocks
all
bore
testimony
that
they
had
found
gold
in
greater
or
less
quantities
in
the
numerous
small
gullies
or
ravines
that
occur
in
that
mountainous
region
on
the
of
july
i
left
the
mill
and
crossed
to
a
stream
emptying
into
the
american
fork
three
or
four
miles
below
the
saw
mill
i
struck
this
stream
now
known
as
weber
creek
at
the
washings
of
sunol
co
they
had
about
thirty
indians
employed
whom
they
payed
in
merchandise
they
were
getting
gold
of
a
character
similar
to
that
found
on
the
main
fork
and
doubtless
in
sufficient
quantities
to
satisfy
them
i
send
you
a
small
specimen
presented
by
this
company
of
their
gold
from
this
point
we
proceeded
up
the
stream
about
eight
miles
where
we
found
a
great
many
people
and
indians
some
engaged
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
others
in
the
small
side
valleys
that
put
into
it
these
latter
are
exceedingly
rich
and
two
ounces
were
considered
an
ordinary
yield
for
a
day
work
a
small
gutter
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
long
by
four
feet
wide
and
two
or
three
feet
deep
was
pointed
out
to
me
as
the
one
where
two
men
william
daly
and
parry
mccoon
had
a
short
time
before
obtained
dollars
worth
of
gold
capt
weber
informed
me
that
he
knew
that
these
two
men
had
employed
four
white
men
and
about
a
hundred
indians
and
that
at
the
end
of
one
week
work
they
paid
off
their
party
and
had
left
worth
of
this
gold
another
small
ravine
was
shown
me
from
which
had
been
taken
upwards
of
worth
of
gold
hundreds
of
similar
ravines
to
all
appearances
are
as
yet
untouched
i
could
not
have
credited
these
reports
had
i
not
seen
in
the
abundance
of
the
precious
metal
evidence
of
their
truth
neligh
an
agent
of
commodore
stockton
had
been
at
work
about
three
weeks
in
the
neighborhood
and
showed
me
in
bags
and
bottles
over
worth
of
gold
and
lyman
a
gentleman
of
education
and
worthy
of
every
credit
said
he
had
been
engaged
with
four
others
with
a
machine
on
the
american
fork
just
below
sutter
mill
that
they
worked
eight
days
and
that
his
share
was
at
the
rate
of
a
day
but
hearing
that
others
were
doing
better
at
weber
place
they
had
removed
there
and
were
then
on
the
point
of
resuming
operations
i
might
tell
of
hundreds
of
similar
instances
but
to
illustrate
how
plentiful
the
gold
was
in
the
pockets
of
common
laborers
i
will
mention
a
simple
occurrence
which
took
place
in
my
presence
when
i
was
at
weber
store
this
store
was
nothing
but
an
arbor
of
bushes
under
which
he
had
exposed
for
sale
goods
and
groceries
suited
to
his
customers
a
man
came
in
picked
up
a
box
of
seidlitz
powders
and
asked
the
price
captain
weber
told
him
it
was
not
for
sale
the
man
offered
an
ounce
of
gold
but
capt
weber
told
it
only
cost
fifty
cents
and
he
did
not
wish
to
sell
it
the
man
then
offered
an
ounce
and
a
half
when
capt
weber
to
take
it
the
prices
of
all
things
are
high
and
yet
indians
who
before
hardly
knew
what
a
breech
cloth
was
can
now
afford
to
buy
the
most
gaudy
dresses
the
country
on
either
side
of
weber
creek
is
much
broken
up
by
hills
and
is
intersected
in
every
direction
by
small
streams
or
ravines
which
contain
more
or
less
gold
those
that
have
been
worked
are
barely
scratched
and
although
thousands
of
ounces
have
been
carried
away
i
do
not
consider
that
a
serious
impression
has
been
made
upon
the
whole
every
day
was
developing
new
and
richer
deposits
and
the
only
impression
seemed
to
be
that
the
metal
would
be
found
in
such
abundance
as
seriously
to
depreciate
in
value
on
the
of
july
i
returned
to
the
lower
mines
and
on
the
following
day
to
sutter
where
on
the
i
was
making
preparations
for
a
visit
to
the
feather
yubah
and
bear
rivers
when
i
received
a
letter
from
commander
long
united
states
navy
who
had
just
arrived
at
san
francisco
from
mazatlan
with
a
crew
for
the
warren
with
orders
to
take
that
vessel
to
the
squadron
at
la
paz
capt
long
wrote
to
me
that
the
mexican
congress
had
adjourned
without
ratifying
the
treaty
of
peace
that
he
had
letters
from
commodore
jones
and
that
his
orders
were
to
sail
with
the
warren
on
or
before
the
of
july
in
consequence
of
this
i
determined
to
return
to
monterey
and
accordingly
arrived
here
on
the
of
july
before
leaving
sutter
i
satisfied
myself
that
gold
existed
in
the
bed
of
the
feather
river
in
the
yubah
and
bear
and
in
many
of
the
smaller
streams
that
lie
between
the
latter
and
the
american
fork
also
that
it
had
been
found
in
the
cosummes
to
the
south
of
the
american
fork
in
each
of
these
streams
the
gold
is
found
in
small
scales
whereas
in
the
intervening
mountains
it
occurs
in
coarser
lumps
sinclair
whose
rancho
is
three
miles
above
sutter
on
the
north
side
of
the
american
employs
about
fifty
indians
on
the
north
fork
not
far
from
its
junction
with
the
main
stream
he
had
been
engaged
about
five
weeks
when
i
saw
him
and
up
to
that
time
his
indians
had
used
simply
closely
woven
willow
baskets
his
nett
proceeds
which
i
saw
were
about
worth
of
gold
he
showed
me
the
proceeds
of
his
last
week
work
fourteen
pounds
avoirdupois
of
gold
the
principal
store
at
sutter
fort
that
of
brannan
had
received
in
payment
for
goods
worth
of
this
gold
from
the
of
may
to
the
of
july
other
merchants
had
also
made
extensive
sales
large
quantities
of
goods
were
daily
sent
forward
to
the
mines
as
the
indians
heretofore
so
poor
and
degraded
have
suddenly
become
consumers
of
the
luxuries
of
life
i
before
mentioned
that
the
greater
part
of
the
farmers
and
rancheros
had
abandoned
their
fields
to
go
to
the
mines
this
is
not
the
case
with
capt
sutter
who
was
carefully
gathering
his
wheat
estimated
at
bushels
flour
is
already
worth
at
sutter
a
barrel
and
soon
will
be
fifty
unless
large
quantities
of
breadstuffs
reach
the
country
much
suffering
will
occur
but
as
each
man
is
now
able
to
pay
a
large
price
it
is
believed
the
merchants
will
bring
from
chili
and
oregon
a
plentiful
supply
for
the
coming
winter
the
most
moderate
estimate
i
could
obtain
from
men
acquainted
with
the
subject
was
that
upwards
of
four
thousand
men
were
working
in
the
gold
district
of
whom
more
than
were
indians
and
that
from
to
worth
of
gold
if
not
more
was
daily
obtained
the
entire
gold
district
with
very
few
exceptions
of
grants
made
some
years
ago
by
the
mexican
authorities
is
on
land
belonging
to
the
united
states
it
was
a
matter
of
serious
reflection
with
me
how
i
could
secure
to
the
government
certain
rents
and
fees
for
the
privilege
of
procuring
this
gold
but
upon
considering
the
large
extent
of
country
the
character
of
the
people
engaged
and
the
small
scattered
force
at
my
command
i
resolved
not
to
interfere
but
to
permit
all
to
work
freely
unless
broils
and
crimes
should
call
for
interferance
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
crime
of
any
kind
was
very
unfrequent
and
that
no
thefts
or
robberies
had
been
committed
in
the
gold
district
all
live
in
tents
in
bush
arbors
or
in
the
open
air
and
men
have
frequently
about
their
persons
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
this
gold
and
it
was
to
me
a
matter
of
surprise
that
so
peaceful
and
quiet
state
of
things
should
continue
to
exist
conflicting
claims
to
particular
spots
of
ground
may
cause
collisions
but
they
will
be
rare
as
the
extent
of
country
is
so
great
and
the
gold
so
abundant
that
for
the
present
there
is
room
enough
for
all
still
the
government
is
entitled
to
rents
for
this
land
and
immediate
steps
should
be
devised
to
collect
them
for
the
longer
it
is
delayed
the
more
difficult
it
will
become
one
plan
i
would
suggest
is
to
send
out
from
the
united
states
surveyors
with
high
salaries
bound
to
serve
specified
periods
a
superintendent
to
be
appointed
at
sutter
fort
with
power
to
grant
licenses
to
work
a
spot
of
ground
say
yards
square
for
one
year
at
a
rent
of
from
to
dollars
at
his
discretion
the
surveyors
to
measure
the
ground
and
place
the
rentor
in
possession
a
better
plan
however
will
be
to
have
the
district
surveyed
and
sold
at
public
auction
to
the
highest
bidder
in
small
parcels
say
from
to
acres
in
either
case
there
will
be
many
intruders
whom
for
years
it
will
be
almost
impossible
to
exclude
the
discovery
of
these
vast
deposits
of
gold
has
entirely
changed
the
character
of
upper
california
its
people
before
engaged
in
cultivating
their
small
patches
of
ground
and
guarding
their
herds
of
cattle
and
horses
have
all
gone
to
the
mines
or
are
on
their
way
thither
laborers
of
every
trade
have
left
their
work
benches
and
tradesmen
their
shops
sailors
desert
their
ships
as
fast
as
they
arrive
on
the
coast
and
several
vessels
have
gone
to
sea
with
hardly
enough
hands
to
spread
a
sail
two
or
three
are
now
at
anchor
in
san
francisco
with
no
crew
on
board
many
desertions
too
have
taken
place
from
the
garrisons
within
the
influence
of
these
mines
soldiers
have
deserted
from
the
post
of
sonoma
from
that
of
san
francisco
and
from
monterey
for
a
few
days
the
evil
appeared
so
threatening
that
great
danger
existed
that
the
garrisons
would
leave
in
a
body
and
i
refer
you
to
my
orders
of
the
of
july
to
show
the
steps
adopted
to
met
this
contingency
i
shall
spare
no
exertions
to
apprehend
and
punish
deserters
but
i
believe
no
time
in
the
history
of
our
country
has
presented
such
temptations
to
desert
as
now
exist
in
california
the
danger
of
apprehension
is
small
and
the
prospect
of
high
wages
certain
pay
and
bounties
are
trifles
as
laboring
men
at
the
mines
can
now
earn
in
more
than
double
a
soldier
pay
and
allowances
for
a
month
and
even
the
pay
of
a
lieutenant
or
captain
can
not
hire
a
servant
a
carpenter
or
mechanic
would
not
listen
to
an
offer
of
less
than
fifteen
or
twenty
dollars
a
day
could
any
combination
of
affairs
try
a
man
fidelity
more
than
this
i
really
think
some
extraordinary
mark
of
favor
should
be
given
to
those
soldiers
who
remain
faithful
to
their
flag
throughout
this
tempting
crisis
no
officer
can
now
live
in
california
on
his
pay
money
has
so
little
value
the
prices
of
necessary
articles
of
clothing
and
subsistence
are
so
exorbitant
and
labor
so
high
that
to
hire
a
cook
or
servant
has
become
an
impossibility
save
to
those
who
are
earning
from
thirty
to
fifty
dollars
a
day
this
state
of
things
can
not
last
for
ever
yet
from
the
geographical
position
of
california
and
the
new
character
it
has
assumed
as
a
mining
country
prices
of
labor
will
always
be
high
and
will
hold
out
temptations
to
desert
i
therefore
have
to
report
if
the
government
wish
to
prevent
desertions
here
on
the
part
of
men
and
to
secure
zeal
on
the
part
of
officers
their
pay
must
be
increased
very
materially
soldiers
both
of
the
volunteers
and
regular
service
discharged
in
this
country
should
be
permitted
at
once
to
locate
their
land
warrants
in
the
gold
district
many
private
letters
have
gone
to
the
united
states
giving
accounts
of
the
vast
quantity
of
gold
recently
discovered
and
it
may
be
a
matter
of
surprise
why
i
have
made
no
report
on
this
subject
at
an
earlier
date
the
reason
is
that
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
believe
the
reports
that
i
heard
of
the
wealth
of
the
gold
district
until
i
visited
it
myself
i
have
no
hesitation
now
in
saying
that
there
is
more
gold
in
the
country
drained
by
the
sacramento
and
san
joaquin
rivers
than
will
pay
the
cost
of
the
present
war
with
mexico
a
hundred
times
over
no
capital
is
required
to
obtain
this
gold
as
the
laboring
man
wants
nothing
but
his
pick
and
shovel
and
tin
pan
with
which
to
dig
and
wash
the
gravel
and
many
frequently
pick
gold
out
of
the
crevices
of
rocks
with
their
butcher
knives
in
pieces
from
one
to
six
ounces
dye
a
gentleman
residing
in
monterey
and
worthy
of
every
credit
has
just
returned
from
feather
river
he
tells
me
that
the
company
to
which
he
belonged
worked
seven
weeks
and
two
days
with
an
average
of
fifty
indians
washers
and
that
their
gross
product
was
pounds
of
gold
his
share
one
seventh
after
paying
all
expenses
is
about
pounds
which
he
brought
with
him
and
exhibited
in
monterey
i
see
no
laboring
man
from
the
mines
who
does
not
show
his
two
three
or
four
pounds
of
gold
a
soldier
of
the
artillery
company
returned
here
a
few
days
ago
from
the
mines
having
been
absent
on
furlough
twenty
days
he
made
by
trading
and
working
during
that
time
during
these
twenty
days
he
was
traveling
ten
or
eleven
days
leaving
but
a
week
in
which
he
made
a
sum
of
money
greater
than
he
receives
in
pay
clothes
and
rations
during
a
whole
enlistment
of
five
years
these
statements
appear
incredible
but
they
are
true
gold
is
also
believed
to
exist
on
the
eastern
slope
of
the
sierra
nevada
and
when
at
the
mines
i
was
informed
by
an
intelligent
mormon
that
it
had
been
found
near
the
great
salt
lake
by
some
of
his
fraternity
nearly
all
the
mormons
are
leaving
california
to
go
to
the
salt
lake
and
this
they
surely
would
not
do
unless
they
were
sure
of
finding
gold
there
in
the
same
abundance
as
they
now
do
on
the
sacramento
the
gold
placer
near
the
mission
of
san
fernando
has
long
been
known
but
has
been
little
wrought
for
want
of
water
this
is
a
spur
which
puts
off
from
the
sierra
nevada
see
fremont
map
the
same
in
which
the
present
mines
occur
there
is
therefore
every
reason
to
believe
that
in
the
intervening
spaces
of
miles
entirely
unexplored
there
must
be
many
hidden
and
rich
deposits
the
placer
gold
is
now
substituted
as
the
currency
of
this
country
in
trade
it
passes
freely
at
per
ounce
as
an
article
of
commerce
its
value
is
not
yet
fixed
the
only
purchase
i
made
was
of
the
specimen
no
which
i
got
of
neligh
at
the
ounce
that
is
about
the
present
cash
value
in
the
country
although
it
has
been
sold
for
less
the
great
demand
for
goods
and
provisions
made
by
sudden
development
of
wealth
has
increased
the
amount
of
commerce
at
san
francisco
very
much
and
it
will
continue
to
increase
i
would
recommend
that
a
mint
be
established
at
some
eligible
point
of
the
bay
of
san
francisco
and
that
machinery
and
all
the
necessary
apparatus
and
workmen
be
sent
out
by
sea
these
workmen
must
be
bound
by
high
wages
and
even
bonds
to
secure
their
faithful
services
else
the
whole
plan
may
be
frustrated
by
their
going
to
the
mines
as
soon
as
they
arrive
in
california
if
this
course
be
not
adopted
gold
to
the
amount
of
many
millions
of
dollars
will
pass
yearly
to
other
countries
to
enrich
their
merchants
and
capitalists
before
leaving
the
subject
of
mines
i
will
mention
that
on
my
return
from
the
sacramento
i
touched
at
new
almoder
the
quicksilver
mine
of
alexander
forbes
consul
of
her
britannic
majesty
at
tepic
this
mine
is
in
a
spur
of
the
mountains
feet
above
the
level
of
the
bay
of
san
francisco
and
is
distant
in
a
southern
direction
from
the
puebla
de
san
josé
about
twelve
miles
the
ore
cinnabar
occurs
in
a
large
vein
dipping
at
a
strong
angle
to
the
horizon
mexican
miners
are
employed
in
working
it
by
driving
shafts
and
galleries
about
six
feet
by
seven
following
the
vein
the
fragments
of
rock
and
ore
are
removed
on
the
backs
of
indians
in
sacks
the
ore
is
then
hauled
in
an
ox
wagon
from
the
mouth
of
the
mine
down
to
a
valley
well
supplied
with
wood
and
water
in
which
the
furnaces
are
situated
the
furnaces
are
of
the
simplest
construction
exactly
like
a
common
in
the
crown
of
which
is
inserted
a
whaler
another
inverted
kettle
forms
the
lid
from
a
hole
in
the
lid
a
small
brick
channel
leads
to
an
apartment
or
chamber
in
the
bottom
of
which
is
inserted
a
small
iron
kettle
the
chamber
has
a
chimney
in
the
morning
of
each
day
the
kettles
are
filled
with
the
mineral
broken
in
small
pieces
mixed
with
lime
fire
is
then
applied
and
kept
up
all
day
the
mercury
is
volatilized
passes
into
the
chamber
is
condensed
on
the
sides
and
bottom
of
the
chamber
and
flows
into
the
pot
prepared
for
it
no
water
is
used
to
condense
the
mercury
during
a
visit
i
made
last
spring
four
such
ovens
were
in
operation
and
yielded
in
the
two
days
i
was
there
pounds
of
quicksilver
worth
at
mazatlan
per
pound
walkinshaw
the
gentleman
now
in
charge
of
this
mine
tells
me
that
the
vein
is
improving
and
that
he
can
afford
to
keep
his
people
employed
even
in
these
extraordinary
times
the
mine
is
very
valuable
of
itself
and
will
become
the
more
so
as
mercury
is
extensively
used
in
obtaining
gold
it
is
not
at
present
used
in
california
for
that
purpose
but
will
be
at
some
future
time
when
i
was
at
this
mine
last
spring
other
parties
were
engaged
in
searching
for
veins
but
none
have
been
discovered
worth
following
up
although
the
earth
in
that
whole
range
of
hills
is
highly
discolored
indicating
the
presence
of
this
ore
i
send
several
beautiful
specimens
properly
labelled
the
amount
of
quicksilver
in

that

nor
do
geographers
agree
with
regard
to
natural
limits
in
that
direction
by
some
it
is
considered
as
embracing
only
the
territory
between
the
pacific
and
the
summit
of
the
mountains
which
border
the
western
side
of
the

to

others
include

others
again
exclude

to
be

nearly
parallel
with
the

to
the
degree
of

under
which
rises

one
of
the
highest
peaks
in
california
about
forty
miles
from
the

further
north
the
coast
turns
more
to
the
west
and
the
space
between
it
and
the
summit
line
of
the
mountains
becomes
wider
so
as
to
exceed
eighty
miles
in
some
places
the
intermediate
region
being
traversed
by
lines
of
hills
or
smaller
mountains
connected
with
the
main

the
principal
of

termination
on

short
time
in

further
north
the

increases
in
length
and
about

are
almost
constant
from

being
moistened
during

never
further
south
except
on
the
mountain
tops
the
whole
of
california
is
however
subject
to
long
droughts
heavy
rains
are
of
rare
occurrence
and
two
years
without
any
is
not
unusual
notwithstanding
which
vegetation
does
not
suffer
to
the
extent
that
might
be
inferred
because
in
the
first
place
many
small
streams
descend
from
the
mountain
ranges
supplying
the
means
of
both
natural
and
artificial
irrigation
and
next
that
the
country
near
the
coast
is
favored
with
a
diurnal
land
and
sea
breeze
and
from
the
comparatively
low
temperature
of
the
sea
the
latter
is
always
in
summer
accompanied
with
fogs
in
the
latter
part
of
the
night
and
which
are
dissipated
by
the
morning
sun
but
serve
to
moisten
the
pastures
and
nourish
a
somewhat
peculiar
vegetation
abounding
in
beautiful
flowers
among
the
valleys
of
upper
california
are
many
streams
some
of
which
discharge
large
quantities
of
water
in
the
rainy
season
but
no
river
is
known
to
flow
through
the
maritime
ridge
of
mountains
from
the
interior
to
the
pacific
except
perhaps
the
sacramento
falling
into
the
bay
of
san
francisco
though
several
are
thus
represented
on

however
contains
but
two
tracts
of
country
capable
of
supporting
large
numbers
of
inhabitants
which
are
that
west
of
mt
san
bernardin
about
the
degree
of
latitude
and
that
surrounding
the
bay
of
san
francisco
and
the
lower
part
of
the
sacramento
and
even
in
these
irrigation
would
be
indispensable
to
insure
success
in
agriculture
the
provincial
terms
of
new
mexico
and
of
upper
and
lower
california
have
been
and
are
yet
rather
designations
of
indefinite
tracts
than
of
real
defined
political
sections
the
pacific
ocean
limits
on
the
west
and
by
treaty
lat
on
the
north
but
inland
and
southward
it
is
in
vain
to
seek
any
definite
boundary
in
order
however
to
give
as
distinct
a
view
as
the
nature
of
the
case
will
admit
let
us
adopt
the
mouth
of
the
colorado
and
gila
or
the
head
of
the
gulf
of
california
as
a
point
on
the
southern
boundary
of
upper
california
the
point
assumed
coincides
very
nearly
with
lat
and
if
adopted
would
give
to
that
country
a
breadth
of
ten
degrees
of
latitude
or
in
round
numbers
statute
miles
from
south
to
north
as
already
stated
the
pacific
ocean
bounds
this
country
on
the
west
and
lat
on
the
north
to
separate
it
on
the
east
from
new
mexico
we
must
assume
the
mountain
chain
of
sierra
madre
or
anahuac
which
in
this
region
inclines
but
little
from
north
to
south
whilst
the
pacific
coast
extends
in
general
course
and
these
opposite
outlines
contract
the
southern
side
to
about
miles
and
open
the
northern
side
to
rather
above
miles
giving
a
mean
breadth
of
miles
the
area
for
all
general
purposes
may
be
safely
taken
at
square
miles
the
general
slope
or
declination
of
this
great
region
is
westward
towards
the
pacific
and
gulf
of
california
the
climate
of
the
western
slope
of
north
america
has
a
warmth
ten
degrees
at
least
higher
than
the
eastern
upon
similar
latitude
the
cause
of
this
difference
is
the
course
of
prevailing
winds
in
the
temperate
zones
of
the
earth
from
the
western
points
thus
the
winds
on
the
western
side
of
the
continent
are
from
the
ocean
and
on
the
eastern
from
the
land
the
soil
is
as
variable
as
the
face
of
the
country
on
the
coast
range
of
hills
there
is
little
to
invite
the
agriculturist
except
in
some
vales
of
no
great
extent
the
hills
are
however
admirably
adapted
for
raising
herds
and
flocks
and
are
at
present
the
of
numerous
deer
elk
to
which
the
short
sweet
grass
and
wild
oats
that
are
spread
over
them
afford
a
plentiful
supply
of
food
the
valley
of
the
sacramento
and
that
of
san
juan
are
the
most
fruitful
parts
of
california
particularly
the
latter
which
is
capable
of
producing
wheat
indian
corn
rye
oats
with
all
the
fruits
of
the
temperate
and
many
of
the
tropical
climates
it
likewise
offers
pasture
grounds
for
cattle
this
region
comprises
a
level
plain
from
fifteen
to
twenty
miles
in
width
extending
from
the
bay
of
san
francisco
beyond
the
mission
of
that
name
north
and
south
this
may
be
termed
the
garden
of
california
but
although
several
small
streams
and
lakes
serve
to
water
it
yet
in
dry
seasons
or
droughts
not
only
the
crops
but
the
herbage
also
suffers
extremely
and
the
cattle
are
deprived
of
food
the
most
extensive
portion
of
upper
california
the
inland
plain
between
the
california
and
the
colorado
range
of
mountains
is
an
arid
waste
destitute
of
the
requisites
for
supplying
the
wants
of
man
this
plain
is
a
waste
of
sand
with
a
few
detached
mountains
some
of
which
rise
to
the
region
of
perpetual
snow
whose
positions
are
unknown
from
these
flow
small
streams
that
are
soon
lost
in
the
sand
a
few
indians
are
scattered
over
the
plain
the
most
miserable
objects
in
creation
the
climate
is
very
peculiar
the
thermometer
on
the
coast
ranging
as
high
on
the
average
in
winter
as
in
summer
indeed
summer
is
really
the
coldest
and
most
disagreeable
part
of
the
year
owing
to
the
winds
which
frequently
prevail
during
that
season
as
you
recede
from
the
coast
however
the
climate
undergoes
a
great
change
for
the
better
at
san
juan
thirty
miles
from
the
coast
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
climates
in
the
world
the
two
principal
rivers
in
upper
california
are
the
sacramento
and
the
san
joaquim
there
are
however
many
smaller
streams
flowing
through
the
different
valleys
which
serve
during
the
dry
season
to
irrigate
the
land
the
only
navigable
stream
is
the
sacramento
beside
the
bays
and
harbors
of
monterey
santa
barbara
and
san
pedro
upper
california
possesses
the
harbor
of
san
francisco
within
a
few
miles
of
the
gold
mines
and
one
of
the
largest
and
most
magnificent
harbors
in
the
world
the
yield
of
wheat
small
grain
and
vegetables
is
said
to
be
great
and
very
remarkable
but
as
agriculture
can
not
succeed
in
upper
california
but
by
irrigation
it
has
hitherto
happened
that
it
has
been
principally
occupied
as
a
pastoral
country
as
costing
less
labor
to
rear
cattle
for
which
it
is
only
necessary
to
provide
keepers
and
have
them
marked
the
numerous
animals
which
are
there
slaughtered
for
little
more
than
their
hides
and
tallow
do
not
putrify
and
become
offensive
as
they
would
in
other
climates
but
as
wood
is
not
everywhere
as
abundant
as
their
bones
the
last
are
sometimes
used
to
supply
the
place
of
the
former
in
the
construction
of
garden
fences
the
area
of
upper
california
is
about
square
miles
and
the
population
exclusive
of
indians
scattered
over
this
extent
as
follows
californians
descended
from
spain
americans
from
united
states
english
scotch
and
irish
european
spaniards
french
and
canadians
germans
italians
portugese
and
sandwich
islanders
mexicans
total
upper
california
is
on
the
whole
admirably
fitted
for
colonization
this
province
presents
the
greatest
facilities
for
raising
cattle
for
cultivating
corn
plants
and
for
the
grape
it
might
contain
twenty
millions
of
inhabitants
and
its
ports
are
a
point
of
necessary
communication
for
vessels
going
from
china
and
asia
to
the
western
coasts
of
north
america
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
so
soon
as
an
intelligent
and
laborious
population
is
established
there
this
country
will
occupy
an
elevated
rank
in
the
commercial
scale
it
would
form
the
where
the
coasts
of
the
great
ocean
would
send
their
products
and
would
furnish
the
greatest
part
of
their
subsistence
in
grains
to
the
to
mexico
to
central
america
to
ecuador
to
peru
to
the
north
coast
of

and
to
many
groups
of

such
as
the
sandwich

the

extending
from

in
lat
on
the

and
to
the
mouth
of

on
the

side
is
a
pile
of
volcanic
debris
and
scoriae
much
of
the

is
still
heated
by
subterranean
fires
no
craters
are
in
action
but
hot
springs
of
water
and
bitumen
and
frequent
earthquakes
and
the
scorched
face
of
the
whole
region
demonstrate
it
to
be
a
mere
mass
upheaved
from
the
sea
and
burned
to
cinders
the
range
of
mountains
that
comes
up
through
lower
california
runs
on
northwardly
into
upper
california
at
an
average
distance
of
sixty
or
seventy
miles
from
the
sea
till
it
falls
away
into
low
hills
south
of
the
bay
of
san
francisco
this
also
is
a
volcanic
range
though
not
so
strongly
marked
to
that
effect
in
the
upper
as
in
the
lower
province
some
portions
of
this
range
are
lofty
that
part
lying
east
and
southeast
of
el
pueblo
de
los
angelos
is
tipped
with
perpetual
snows
but
the
greater
part
of
it
presents
a
base
covered
up
to
more
than
half
of
the
whole
elevation
with
pine
and
cedar
forests
the
remaining
height
being
composed
of
bare
dark
glistening
rocks
lying
in
confused
masses
or
turreted
in
the
manner
observed
on
the
black

wilderness
towers
and
battlements
lifted
up
to
heaven
among
which
the
white
feathery
clouds
of
beautiful
days
rest
shining
in
the
mellow
sun
the
snowy
mountain
range
is
perhaps
the
boldest
and
most
peculiar
of
the
california
highlands
its
western
terminus
is
cape
mendocino
a
bold
headland
bending
over
the
pacific
in
north
latitude
its
western
terminus
is
in
the
wind
river
mountains
latitude
about
seven
hundred
miles
from
the
sea
its
peculiarity
consists
in
what
may
be
termed
its
confused
geological
character
near
the
sea
its
rocks
are
primitive
its
strata
regular
a
hundred
miles
from
the
sea
where
the
president
range
crosses
it
everything
is
fused
burned
and
at
the
distance
of
seventy
miles
northeastwardly
from
the
bay
of
san
francisco
a
spur
comes
off
with
a
lofty
peak
which
pours
out
immense
quantities
of
lava
and
shoots
up
a
flame
so
broad
and
bright
as
to
be
seen
at
sea
and
to
produce
distinct
shadows
at
eighty
miles
distance
here
is
an
extensive
tract
of
this
range
which
has
been
burned
and
whose
strata
have
been
torn
from
their
natural
positions
displaying
an
amalgamated
mass
of
primitive
rock
mingled
with
various
descriptions
of
volcanic
remains
from
this
point
eastward
it
is
a
broken
irregular
chain
of
peaks
and
rifted
collateral
ranges
and
spurs
running
off
northwardly
and
southwardly
some
of
which
are
primitive
and
others
volcanic
another
range
of
mountains
which
deserves
notice
in
this
place
is
that
which
bounds
the
valley
of
the
san
joaquim
on
the
east
this
is
a
wide
and
towering
range
it
is
in
fact
a
continuation
of
the
president
range
and
partakes
very
strongly
of
its
volcanic
character
that
part
of
it
which
lies
eastwardly
from
the
bay
of
san
francisco
is
very
broad
and
lofty
one
of
its
peaks
mount
jackson
as
it
is
called
is
the
highest
in
all
the
president
range
mountains
of
great
size
are
piled
around
it
but
they
appear
like
molehills
beside
that
veteran
mount
its
vast
peak
towers
over
them
all
several
thousand
feet
a
glittering
cone
of
ice
all
over
the
californias
the
traveler
finds
evidences
of
volcanic
action
far
in
the
interior
among
the
deserts
in
the
streams
in
the
heights
in
the
plains
everywhere
are
manifestations
of
the
fact
that
the
current
of
subterranean
fire
which
crossed
the
pacific
throwing
up
that
line
of
islands
lying
on
the
south
of
the
sea
of
kamschatka
and
passed
down
the
continent
upheaving
the
oregon
territory
did
also
bring
up
from
the
bed
of
the
ocean
the
californias
the
peninsula
or
lower
california
which
extends
from
cape
san
lucas
in
lat
to
the
bay
of
todos
santos
in
lat
is
a
pile
of
barren
volcanic
mountains
with
very
few
streams
and
still
fewer
spots
of
ground
capable
of
sustaining
vegetation
the
territory
lying
north
and
south
of
the
colorado
of
the
west
and
within
the
boundaries
of
the
californias
is
a
howling
desolation
from
the
highlands
near
the
mouth
of
the
rio
colorado
a
wild
and
somewhat
interesting
scene
opens
in
the
east
appears
a
line
of
mountains
of
a
dark
hue
stretching
down
the
coast
of
the
gulf
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
these
heights
are
generally
destitute
of
trees
but
timber
grows
in
some
of
the
ravines
the
general
aspect
however
is
far
from
pleasing
there
is
such
a
vastness
of
monotonous
desolation
so
dry
so
blistered
with
volcanic
fires
so
forbidding
to
the
wants
of
thirsting
and
hungering
men
that
one
gladly
turns
his
eye
upon
the
water
the
de
the
gulf
of
california
the
colorado
two
and
a
half
miles
in
width
rushes
into
this
gulf
with
great
force
lashing
as
it
goes
the
small
islands
lying
at
its
mouth
and
for
many
leagues
around
the
waters
of
the
gulf
are
discolored
by
its
turbulent
flood
on
the
west
sweep
away
the
mountains
of
lower
california
these
also
are
a
thirsty
mass
of
burned
rocks
so
dry
that
vegetation
finds
no
among
them
that
province
of
lower
california
varies
from
thirty
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
width
a
superficial
extent
almost
equal
to
that
of
great
britain
and
yet
on
account
of
its
barrenness
never
will
from
the
products
of
the
soil
maintain
five
hundred
thousand
people
in
a
state
of
comfort
ordinarily
found
in
the
civilized
condition
every
few
years
tornadoes
sweep
over
the
country
with
such
violence
and
bearing
with
them
such
floods
of
rain
that
whatever
of
soil
has
been
in
any
manner
previously
formed
is
swept
into
the
sea
so
that
even
those
little
nooks
among
the
mountains
where
the
inhabitants
from
time
to
time
make
their
fields
and
task
the
vexed
earth
for
a
scanty
subsistence
are
liable
to
be
laid
bare
by
the
torrents
in
case
the
soil
chance
to
be
lodged
in
some
other
dell
before
it
reach
the
ocean
or
the
gulf
and
the
people
follow
it
to
its
new
location
they
find
perhaps
no
water
there
and
can
not
cultivate
it
consequently
they
are
often
driven
by
dreadful
want
to
some
other
point
in
quest
of
sustenance
where
they
may
not
find
it
and
perish
among
the
parched
highlands
the
mean
range
of
temperature
in
the
whole
country
in
the
summer
season
is
from
to
fahrenheit
the
rains
fall
in
the
winter
months
are
very
severe
and
of
short
duration
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
the
air
is
dry
and
clear
and
the
sky
more
beautiful
than
the
imagination
can
conceive
the
range
of
mountains
occupying
the
whole
interior
of
this
country
vary
in
height
from
one
to
five
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
they
are
almost
bare
of
all
verdure
mere
brown
piles
of
barrenness
sprinkled
here
and
there
with
a
cluster
of
briars
small
shrubs
or
dwarf
trees
among
the
ridges
are
a
few
spots
to
which
the
sweeping
rains
have
spared
a
little
soil
these
if
watered
by
springs
or
streams
are
beautiful
and
productive
there
are
also
a
few
places
near
the
coast
which
are
well
adapted
to
tillage
and
pasturage
but
the
principal
difficulty
with
this
region
is
one
common
to
all
countries
of
volcanic
origin
a
scarcity
of
water
the
porousness
of
the
rocks
allows
it
to
pass
under
ground
to
the
sea
consequently
one
finds
few
streams
and
springs
in
lower
california
from
the
cape
san
lucas
to
the
mouth
of
the
colorado
six
hundred
miles
there
are
only
two
streams
emptying
into
the
gulf
one
of
these
is
called
san
josef
del
cabo
it
passes
through
the
plantations
of
the
mission
bearing
the
same
name
and
discharges
itself
into
the
bay
of
san
barnabas
the
other
is
the
mulege
which
waters
the
mission
of
santa
rosalia
and
enters
the
gulf
in
latitude
these
are
not
navigable
the
streams
on
the
ocean
coast
also
are
few
and
small
some
of
them
are
large
enough
to
propel
light
machinery
or
irrigate
considerable
tracts
of
land
but
none
of
them
are
navigable
in
the
interior
are
several
large
springs
which
send
out
abundant
currents
along
the
rocky
beds
of
their
upper
courses
but
when
they
reach
the
loose
sands
and
porous
rocks
of
the
lower
country
they
sink
and
enter
the
sea
through
subterranean
channels
a
great
misfortune
it
is
too
that
the
lands
which
border
those
portions
of
these
streams
which
run
above
the
ground
consist
of
barren
rocks
where
springs
however
and
arable
land
occur
together
immense
fertility
is
the
consequence
there
is
some
variety
of
climate
on
the
coasts
which
it
may
be
well
to
mention
on
the
pacific
shore
the
temperature
is
rendered
delightfully
balmy
by
the
sea
breezes
and
the
humidity
which
they
bring
along
with
them
fahrenheit
thermometer
ranges
on
this
coast
during
the
summer
between
and
degrees
in
the
winter
months
while
the
rains
are
falling
it
sinks
as
low
as
fifty
degrees
above
zero
on
the
gulf
coast
there
is
a
still
greater
variation
while
at
the
cape
the
mercury
stands
between
sixty
and
seventy
degrees
near
the
head
of
the
gulf
it
is
down
to
the
freezing
point
these
isolated
facts
in
regard
to
the
great
territory
under
consideration
will
give
the
reader
as
perfect
an
idea
of
the
surface
and
agricultural
capacities
of
lower
california
as
will
be
here
needed
different
routes
to
california
there
are
four
different
routes
to
california
from
the
united
states
one
is
from
new
york
to
vera
cruz
thence
across
mexico
by
the
to
acapulco
on
the
pacific
where
all
the
northern
bound
vessels
touch
this
route
would
be
preferable
to
all
others
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
road
from
vera
cruz
to
acapulco
is
infested
with
robbers
another
route
is
by
steam
around
cape
horn
a
long
voyage
though
perhaps
the
cheapest
route
it
should
be
performed
in
our
winter
when
it
is
summer
in
the
southern
hemisphere
and
consequently
warmer
at
cape
horn
than
at
any
other
season
of
the
year
the
fare
on
this
route
by
steam
is
about
the
time
of
performing
the
voyage
is
about
days
another
route
is
by
the
isthmus
of
darien
the
fare
on
this
route
is
as
follows
from
new
york
to
chagres
by
steam
from
chagres
to
panama
across
the
isthmus
from
panama
to
san
francisco
from
new
york
to
chagres
by
sailing
vessel
the
time
of
the
voyage
is
as
follows
from
new
york
to
chagres
to
days
from
chagres
to
panama
from
panama
to
san
the
following
description
of
chagres
and
panama
will
be
found
both
interesting
and
valuable
to
the
traveler
on
this
route
the
town
of
chagres
as
it
is
usually
called
but
in
reality
village
or
collection
of
huts
is
as
is
well
known
situated
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
chagres
where
it
empties
itself
into
the
atlantic
ocean
it
is
but
a
small
village
and
the
harbor
is
likewise
small
though
secure
it
is
formed
by
the
jutting
out
of
a
narrow
neck
of
land
and
is
defended
by
the
castle
which
is
built
on
a
high
bluff
on
the
other
side
the
village
itself
as
i
have
before
said
is
merely
a
collection
of
huts
and
is
situated
in
the
midst
of
a
swamp
at
least
the
ground
is
low
and
the
continual
rains
which
prevail
at
chagres
keep
it
in
a
swampy
condition
chagres
is
inhabited
by
colored
people
entirely
with
the
exception
of
some
few
officials
at
the
castle
and
in
the
its
population
i
speak
of
course
of
it
previous
to
the
influx
was
probably
not
more
than
in
all
if
so
much
its
climate
is
without
doubt
the
most
pestiferous
for
whites
in
the
whole
world
the
coast
of
africa
which
enjoys
a
dreadful
reputation
in
this
way
is
not
so
deadly
in
its
climate
as
is
chagres
the
thermometer
ranges
from
to
all
the
year
and
it
rains
every
day
many
a
traveler
who
has
incautiously
remained
there
for
a
few
days
and
nights
has
had
cause
to
remember
chagres
and
many
a
gallant
crew
who
have
entered
the
harbor
in
full
health
have
ere
many
days
found
their
final
resting
place
on
the
dank
and
malarious
banks
of
the
river
bilious
remittent
and
congestive
fever
in
their
most
malignant
forms
seem
to
hover
over
chagres
ever
ready
to
pounce
down
on
the
stranger
even
the
acclimated
resident
of
the
tropics
runs
a
great
risk
in
staying
any
time
in
chagres
but
the
stranger
fresh
from
the
north
and
its
invigorating
breezes
runs
a
most
fearful
one
the
river
journey
is
performed
in
canoes
propelled
up
the
stream
by
means
of
poles
there
are
two
points
at
which
one
may
land
viz
the
villages
of
gorgona
and
cruces
the
distance
from
chagres
to
the
first
named
is
about
or
miles
to
the
latter
some
or
miles
the
traveler
who
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
embarks
on
a
south
american
river
like
the
chagres
can
not
fail
to
experience
a
singular
depression
of
spirits
at
the
dark
and
sombre
aspect
of
the
scene
in
the
first
place
he
finds
himself
in
a
canoe
so
small
that
he
is
forced
to
lay
quietly
in
the
very
centre
of
the
stern
portion
in
order
to
prevent
it
upsetting
the
palm
leaf
thatch
or
as
it
is
termed
on
the
river
over
his
portion
of
the
boat
shuts
out
much
of
the
view
while
his
baggage
piled
carefully
amidships
and
covered
with
oil
cloths
as
they
are
termed
is
under
the
charge
of
his
active
boatman
who
stripped
to
the
buff
with
long
pole
in
hand
expertly
propels
the
boat
up
stream
with
many
a
cry
and
strange
exclamation
the
river
itself
is
a
dark
muddy
and
rapid
stream
in
some
parts
quite
narrow
and
again
at
other
points
it
is
from
to
yards
wide
let
no
one
fancy
that
it
resembles
the
bright
and
cheerful
rivers
which
are
met
with
here
at
the
north
no
pleasant
villages
adorn
its
banks
no
signs
of
civilization
are
seen
on
them
nothing
but
the
sombre
primeval
forest
which
grows
with
all
the
luxury
of
the
tropics
down
to
the
very
margin
of
its
swampy
banks
a
light
canoe
with
two
active
boatmen
and
but
one
passenger
in
it
will
reach
cruces
in
ten
or
twelve
hours
whilst
a
heavier
one
might
require
hours
to
accomplish
the
passage
the
passenger
must
take
his
provisions
with
him
as
none
are
to
be
had
on
the
river
a
doubloon
was
the
lowest
charge
for
a
single
passenger
and
from
that
up
to
two
three
and
even
four
doubloons
as
for
taking
our
boats
from
here
and
rowing
them
up
the
river
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
hopeless
attempt
hardy
boatmen
from
our
southwestern
states
who
are
accustomed
to
a
much
similar
mode
of
travel
on
their
rivers
would
probably
be
able
to
accomplish
it
but
in
that
burning
and
unhealthy
climate
for
young
men
fresh
from
the
north
unacquainted
with
the
dangers
of
such
navigation
and
all
unacclimated
to
attempt
such
a
feat
would
be
madness
indeed
let
us
however
suppose
the
journey
completed
and
our
adventurer
safely
arrived
at
cruces
he
may
now
congratulate
himself
on
having
achieved
the
most
toilsome
part
of
his
journey
and
but
miles
of
land
route
intervene
between
him
and
the
glorious
pacific
ocean
cruces
is
a
small
village
situated
on
a
plain
immediately
on
the
banks
of
the
river
which
here
are
high
and
sandy
gorgona
the
other
landing
place
is
a
few
miles
below
cruces
and
is
likewise
a
small
village
very
similar
to
cruces
in
fact
all
south
american
villages
resemble
one
another
very
much
from
these
two
points
both
about
the
same
distance
from
panama
there
are
roads
to
that
city
which
roads
unite
about
nine
miles
from
it
starting
from
either
point
he
commences
his
journey
across
the
isthmus
the
usual
method
of
performing
it
is
on
horse
or
on
with
another
mule
to
carry
the
baggage
and
a
muleteer
who
acts
as
guide
the
road
is
a
mere
bridle
path
and
as
the
rains
on
the
isthmus
are
very
heavy
and
there
is
more
or
less
of
them
all
the
year
round
the
and
swampy
places
to
be
crossed
are
very
numerous
those
who
at
the
north
talk
gaily
of
a
walk
across
the
isthmus
as
if
the
road
were
as
plain
and
easy
as
some
of
our
macadamized
turnpikes
would
alter
their
tone
a
little
could
they
see
the
road
as
it
is
as
for
walking
from
cruces
to
panama
in
case
mules
are
scarce
the
feat
is
by
no
means
impossible
provided
the
traveler
arrives
in
cruces
in
good
health
and
has
but
little
baggage
it
might
easily
be
done
with
the
assistance
of
a
guide
but
let
no
stranger
unacquainted
with
the
language
and
new
to
such
countries
attempt
it
without
a
guide
having
then
fairly
started
from
cruces
either
on
horse
or
on
foot
after
a
toilsome
journey
of
some
eight
or
ten
hours
the
savanna
of
panama
is
at
last
reached
and
the
sight
of
the
broad
and
glittering
pacific
ocean
and
the
white
towers
of
the
cathedral
of
panama
which
are
seen
at
the
distance
of
about
four
miles
from
the
city
give
the
now
weary
traveler
assurance
that
his
journey
will
shortly
end
and
another
hour
toil
brings
him
to
the
suburbs
of
the
famed
city
of
panama
we
will
find
however
that
with
this
as
with
most
other
south
american
cities
is
distance
lends
enchantment
to
the
view
and
clothes
the
mountain
with
its
azure
hue
the
city
of
panama
is
situated
on
the
shores
of
the
bay
of
that
name
and
a
most
beautiful
bay
it
is
too
what
is
the
number
of
the
present
population
i
can
not
say
as
it
is
doubtless
filled
with
strangers
it
formerly
contained
from
to
inhabitants
and
was
a
quiet
still
city
where
during
the
day
nought
but
the
sounds
of
the
convent
bell
and
church
bells
disturbed
the
horses
of
the
citizens
in
their
grazings
in
the
public
squares
which
were
all
overgrown
with
grass
the
trade
carried
on
consisted
in
importing
dry
goods
from
jamaica
for
the
supply
of
the
isthmenians
the
neighboring
produce
of
veragua
the
pearl
islands
the
towns
of
chiriqui
david
and
their
vicinities
and
the
various
little
inland
towns
goods
also
were
sent
down
to
the
ports
of
payta
in
peru
and
guayaquil
in
the
ecuador
the
returns
made
for
these
goods
consisted
in
the
produce
of
the
isthmus
such
as
gold
dust
hides
india
rubber
pearl
oyster
shells
from
which
the
mother
of
pearl
of
commerce
is
made
sarsaparilla
the
climate
is
warm
say
from
to
degrees
all
the
year
round
the
rainy
season
long
and
severe
the
nights
in
panama
however
are
much
cooler
than
usual
in
tropical
climate
the
other
route
is
the
overland
by
independence
the
details
of
this
route
are
given
below
by
edwin
bryant
the
author
of
what
i
saw
in
california
they
were
communicated
to
the
louisville
courier
in
answer
to
questions
but
to
by
the
editor
which
route
by
land
is
the
best
for
the
emigrant
the
route
via
independence
or
joseph
missouri
to
fort
daramie
south
pass
fort
hall
the
sink
of
mary
river
the
old
route
let
no
emigrant
carrying
his
family
with
him
deviate
from
it
or
imagine
to
himself
that
he
can
find
a
better
road
this
road
is
the
best
that
has
yet
been
discovered
and
to
the
bay
of
san
francisco
and
the
gold
regions
it
is
much
the
shortest
the
indians
moreover
on
this
route
have
up
to
the
present
time
been
so
friendly
as
to
commit
no
acts
of
hostility
on
the
emigrants
the
trail
is
plain
and
good
where
there
are
no
physical
obstructions
and
the
emigrant
by
taking
this
route
will
certainly
reach
his
destination
in
good
season
and
without
disaster
from
our
information
we
would
most
earnestly
advise
all
emigrants
to
take
this
trail
without
deviation
if
they
would
avoid
the
fatal
calamities
which
almost
invariably
have
attended
those
who
have
undertaken
to
explore
new
routes
what
kind
of
wagon
and
team
is
preferable
the
lightest
wagon
that
can
be
constructed
of
sufficient
strength
to
carry
pounds
weight
as
the
vehicle
most
desirable
no
wagon
should
be
loaded
over
this
weight
for
if
it
is
it
will
be
certain
to
stall
in
the
muddy
sloughs
and
crossings
on
the
prairie
in
the
first
part
of
the
journey
this
wagon
can
be
hauled
by
three
or
four
yokes
of
oxen
or
six
mules
oxen
are
usually
employed
by
the
immigrants
for
hauling
their
wagons
they
travel
about
fifteen
miles
per
day
and
all
things
considered
are
perhaps
equal
to
mules
for
this
service
although
they
can
not
travel
so
fast
they
are
however
less
expensive
and
there
is
not
so
much
danger
of
their
starving
and
of
being
stolen
by
the
indians
can
only
be
employed
by
parties
of
men
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
transport
a
party
of
women
and
children
on
with
the
provisions
clothing
and
baggage
necessary
to
their
comfort
a
party
of
men
however
with
can
make
the
journey
in
less
time
by
one
month
than
it
can
be
done
in
wagons
carrying
with
them
however
nothing
more
than
their
provisions
clothing
and
ammunition
for
parties
of
men
going
out
it
would
be
well
to
haul
their
wagons
provisions
as
far
as
fort
laramie
or
fort
hall
by
mules
carrying
with
them
and
or
large
adapted
to
the
pack
saddle
with
ropes
for
packing
when
if
they
saw
proper
they
could
dispose
of
their
wagons
for
indian
ponies
and
pack
into
california
gaining
perhaps
two
or
three
weeks
time
what
provisions
are
necessary
to
a
man
the
provisions
actually
necessary
per
man
are
as
follows
of
flour
lbs
of
bacon
lbs
coffee
sugar
added
to
these
the
main
items
there
should
be
a
small
quantity
of
rice
fifty
or
pounds
of
crackers
dried
peaches
and
a
keg
of
lard
with
salt
pepper
with
such
other
luxuries
of
light
weight
as
the
person
chooses
to
purchase
he
will
think
of
them
before
he
starts
what
arms
and
ammunition
are
necessary
every
man
should
be
provided
with
a
good
rifle
and
if
convenient
with
a
pair
of
pistols
five
pounds
of
powder
and
ten
pounds
of
lead
a
revolving
belt
pistol
may
be
found
useful
with
the
wagon
there
should
be
carried
such
carpenter
tools
as
a
auger
gimblet
chisel
an
axe
hammer
and
hatchet
the
last
weapon
every
man
should
have
in
his
belt
with
a
hunter
or
a
bowie
knife
what
is
the
length
of
the
journey
from
independence
to
the
first
settlement
in
california
which
is
near
the
gold
region
is
about
miles
to
san
francisco
miles
what
is
the
time
for
starting
emigrants
should
be
at
independence
joseph
or
the
point
of
starting
by
the
of
april
and
start
as
soon
thereafter
as
the
grass
on
the
prairies
will
permit
this
is
sometimes
by
the
first
of
may
and
sometimes
ten
days
later
according
to
the
season
the
gold
regions
miscellaneous
matter
the
following
extract
is
from
a
letter
written
by
thomas
larkin
to
buchanan
the
secretary
of
state
it
is
dated
at
monterey
june
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
on
the
american
fork
feather
river
and
copimes
river
there
are
near
two
thousand
people
of
them
foreigners
perhaps
there
are
one
hundred
families
who
have
their
teams
wagons
and
tents
many
persons
are
waiting
to
see
whether
the
months
of
july
and
august
will
be
sickly
before
they
leave
their
present
business
to
go
to
the
placer
the
discovery
of
this
gold
was
made
by
some
mormons
in
january
or
february
who
for
a
time
kept
it
a
secret
the
majority
of
those
who
are
working
there
began
in
may
in
most
every
instance
the
men
after
digging
a
few
days
have
been
compelled
to
leave
for
the
purpose
of
returning
home
to
see
their
families
arrange
their
business
and
purchase
provisions
i
feel
confident
in
saying
there
are
fifty
men
in
this
placer
who
have
on
an
average
each
obtained
in
may
and
june
i
have
not
met
with
any
person
who
had
been
fully
employed
in
washing
gold
one
month
most
however
appear
to
have
averaged
an
ounce
per
day
i
think
there
must
by
this
time
be
over
men
at
work
upon
the
different
branches
of
the
sacramento
putting
their
gains
at
per
day
for
six
days
in
the
week
appears
to
me
not
overrated
should
this
news
reach
the
emigration
of
california
and
oregon
now
on
the
road
connected
with
the
indian
wars
now
impoverishing
the
latter
country
we
should
have
a
large
addition
to
our
population
and
should
the
richness
of
the
gold
region
continue
our
emigrants
in
will
be
many
thousand
and
in
still
more
if
our
countrymen
in
california
as
clerks
mechanics
and
workmen
will
forsake
employment
at
from
to
per
day
how
many
more
of
the
same
class
in
the
atlantic
states
earning
much
less
will
leave
for
this
country
under
such
prospects
it
is
the
opinion
of
many
who
have
visited
the
gold
regions
the
past
and
present
months
that
the
ground
will
afford
gold
for
many
years
perhaps
for
a
century
from
my
own
examination
of
the
rivers
and
their
banks
i
am
of
opinion
that
at
least
for
a
few
years
the
golden
products
will
equal
the
present
year
however
as
neither
men
of
science
nor
the
laborers
now
at
work
have
made
any
explorations
of
consequence
it
is
a
matter
of
impossibility
to
give
any
opinion
as
to
the
extent
and
richness
of
this
part
of
california
every
mexican
who
has
seen
the
place
says
throughout
their
republic
there
has
never
been
any
placer
like
this
one
could
polk
and
yourself
see
california
as
we
now
see
it
you
would
think
that
a
few
thousand
people
on
miles
square
of
the
sacramento
valley
would
yearly
turn
out
of
this
river
the
whole
price
our
country
pays
for
the
acquired
territory
when
i
finished
my
first
letter
i
doubted
my
own
writing
and
to
be
better
satisfied
showed
it
to
one
of
the
principal
merchants
of
san
francisco
and
to
capt
folsom
of
the
quartermaster
department
who
decided
at
once
i
was
far
below
the
reality
you
certainly
will
suppose
from
my
two
letters
that
i
am
like
others
led
away
by
the
excitement
of
the
day
i
think
i
am
not
in
my
last
i
inclosed
a
small
sample
of
the
gold
dust
and
i
find
my
only
error
was
in
putting
a
value
to
the
sand
at
that
time
i
was
not
aware
how
the
gold
was
found
i
now
can
describe
the
mode
of
collecting
it
a
person
without
a
machine
after
digging
off
one
or
two
feet
of
the
upper
ground
near
the
water
in
some
cases
they
take
the
top
earth
throws
into
a
tin
pan
or
wooden
bowl
a
shovel
full
of
loose
dirt
and
stones
then
placing
the
basin
an
inch
or
two
under
water
continues
to
stir
up
the
dirt
with
his
hand
in
such
a
manner
that
the
running
water
will
carry
off
the
light
earths
occasionally
with
his
hand
throwing
out
the
stones
after
an
operation
of
this
kind
for
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
a
spoonful
of
small
black
sand
remains
this
is
on
a
handkerchief
or
cloth
dried
in
the
sun
the
emerge
is
blown
off
leaving
the
pure
gold
i
have
the
pleasure
of
inclosing
a
paper
of
this
sand
and
gold
which
i
from
a
bucket
of
dirt
and
stones
in
half
an
hour
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
water
washed
out
myself
the
value
of
it
may
be
or
the
size
of
the
gold
depends
in
some
measure
upon
the
river
from
which
it
is
taken
the
banks
of
one
river
having
larger
grains
of
gold
than
another
i
presume
more
than
of
the
gold
put
into
pans
or
machines
is
washed
out
and
goes
down
the
stream
this
is
of
no
consequence
to
the
washers
who
care
only
for
the
present
time
some
have
formed
companies
of
four
or
five
men
and
have
a
machine
put
together
in
a
day
which
worked
to
much
advantage
yet
many
prefer
to
work
alone
with
a
wooden
bowl
or
tin
pan
worth
fifteen
or
twenty
cents
in
the
states
but
eight
to
sixteen
dollars
at
the
gold
region
as
the
workmen
continue
and
materials
can
be
obtained
improvements
will
take
place
in
the
mode
of
obtaining
gold
at
present
it
is
obtained
by
standing
in
the
water
and
with
much
severe
labor
or
such
as
is
called
here
severe
labor
how
long
this
gathering
of
gold
by
the
handful
will
continue
here
or
the
future
effect
it
will
have
on
california
i
can
not
say
of
the
houses
in
the
town
on
the
bay
of
san
francisco
are
deserted
houses
are
sold
at
the
price
of
the
ground
lots
the
effects
are
this
week
showing
themselves
in
monterey
almost
every
house
i
had
hired
out
is
given
up
every
blacksmith
carpenter
and
lawyer
is
leaving
brick
yards
saw
mills
and
ranches
are
left
perfectly
alone
a
large
number
of
the
volunteers
at
san
francisco
and
sonoma
have
deserted
some
have
been
retaken
and
brought
back
public
and
private
vessels
are
losing
their
crews
my
clerks
have
had
per
cent
advance
offered
them
on
their
wages
to
accept
employment
a
complete
revolution
in
the
ordinary
state
of
affairs
is
taking
place
both
of
our
newspapers
are
discontinued
from
want
of
workmen
and
the
loss
of
their
agencies
the
alcaldes
have
left
san
francisco
and
i
believe
sonoma
likewise
the
former
place
has
not
a
justice
of
the
peace
left
the
second
alcalde
of
monterey
joins
the
keepers
of
our
principal
hotel
who
have
closed
their
office
and
house
and
will
leave
tomorrow
for
the
golden
rivers
i
saw
on
the
ground
a
lawyer
who
was
last
year
attorney
general
of
the
king
of
the
sandwich
islands
digging
and
washing
out
his
ounce
and
a
half
per
day
near
him
can
be
found
most
all
his
brethren
of
the
long
robe
working
in
the
same
occupation
to
conclude
my
letter
is
long
but
i
could
not
well
describe
what
i
have
seen
in
less
words
and
i
now
can
believe
that
my
account
may
be
doubted
if
the
affair
proves
a
bubble
a
mere
excitement
i
know
not
how
we
can
all
be
deceived
as
we
are
situated
gov
mason
and
his
staff
have
left
monterey
to
visit
the
place
in
question
and
will
i
suppose
soon
forward
to
his
department
his
views
and
opinions
on
this
subject
most
of
the
land
where
gold
has
been
discovered
is
public
land
there
are
on
different
rivers
some
private
grants
i
have
three
such
purchased
in
and
but
have
not
learned
that
any
private
lands
have
produced
gold
though
they
may
hereafter
do
so
here
is
a
letter
of
great
sprightliness
beauty
and
interest
prepared
by
that
finished
scholar
and
noted
writer
the
rev
walter
colton
alcalde
of
monterey
monterey
california
the
gold
discoveries
still
continue
every
day
brings
some
new
deposit
to
light
it
has
been
found
in
large
quantities
on
the
sacramento
feather
river
yerba
river
the
american
fork
north
and
south
branches
the
cosamer
and
in
many
dry
ravines
and
indeed
on
the
tops
of
high
hills
the
tract
of
country
in
which
it
is
ascertained
to
exist
extends
some
two
hundred
miles
north
and
south
and
some
sixty
east
and
west
and
these
limits
are
every
day
enlarging
by
new
discoveries
on
the
streams
where
the
gold
has
been
subjected
to
the
action
of
water
and
sand
it
exists
in
fine
grains
on
the
hills
and
among
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
it
is
found
in
rough
jagged
pieces
of
a
quarter
or
half
an
ounce
in
weight
and
sometimes
two
or
three
ounces
the
gold
is
obtained
in
a
variety
of
ways
some
wash
it
out
of
the
sand
with
bowls
some
with
a
machine
made
like
a
cradle
only
longer
and
open
at
the
foot
while
at
the
other
end
instead
of
a
squalling
infant
there
is
a
grating
upon
which
the
earth
is
thrown
and
then
water
both
pass
through
the
grating
the
cradle
is
rocked
and
being
on
an
inclined
plane
the
water
carries
off
the
earth
and
the
gold
is
deposited
in
the
bottom
of
the
cradle
so
the
two
things
most
prized
in
this
world
gold
and
infant
beauty
are
both
rocked
out
of
their
primitive
stage
one
to
pamper
pride
and
the
other
to
pamper
the
worm
some
forego
cradles
and
bowls
as
too
tame
an
occupation
and
mounted
on
horses
half
wild
dash
up
the
mountain
gorges
and
over
the
steep
hills
picking
the
gold
from
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
with
their
bowie
knives
a
much
better
use
to
make
of
these
instruments
than
picking
the
life
out
of
men
bodies
for
what
is
a
man
with
that
article
picked
out
of
him
a
larger
party
well
mounted
are
following
up
the
channel
of
the
sacramento
to
discover
where
this
gold
found
in
its
banks
comes
from
and
imagine
that
near
the
river
fount
they
will
find
the
great
yellow
mass
itself
but
they
might
as
well
hunt
the
fleeting
rainbow
the
gold
was
thrown
up
from
the
bed
of
the
ocean
with
the
rocks
and
sands
in
which
it
is
found
and
still
bears
where
it
has
escaped
the
action
of
the
element
vivid
traces
of
volcanic
fire
it
often
encases
a
crystal
of
quartz
in
which
the
pebble
lies
as
if
it
had
slumbered
there
from
eternity
its
beautiful
repose
sets
human
artifice
at
defiance
how
strange
that
this
ore
should
have
lain
here
scattered
about
in
all
directions
peeping
everywhere
out
of
the
earth
and
sparkling
in
the
sun
and
been
trod
upon
for
ages
by
white
men
and
savages
and
by
the
emissaries
of
every
scientific
association
in
the
world
and
never
till
now
have
been
discovered
what
an
ass
man
is
with
all
his
learning
he
stupidly
stumbles
over
hills
of
gold
to
reach
a
rare
pepper
pod
or
rifle
a
bird
nest
the
whole
country
is
now
moving
on
the
mines
monterey
san
francisco
sonoma
san
jose
and
santa
cruz
are
emptied
of
their
male
population
a
stranger
coming
here
would
suppose
he
had
arrived
among
a
race
of
women
who
by
some
anomalous
provision
of
nature
multiplied
their
images
without
the
presence
of
the
other
sex
but
not
a
few
of
the
women
have
gone
too
especially
those
who
had
got
out
of
tea
for
what
is
women
without
her
tea
pot
a
pythoness
without
her
shaking
trypod
an
angel
that
has
lost
his
lyre
every
bowl
tray
and
piggin
has
gone
to
the
mines
everything
in
short
that
has
a
scoop
in
it
that
will
hold
sand
and
water
all
the
iron
has
been
worked
up
into
and
spades
and
all
these
roll
back
upon
us
in
the
shape
of
gold
we
have
therefore
plenty
of
gold
but
little
to
eat
and
still
less
to
wear
our
supplies
must
come
from
oregon
chili
and
the
united
states
our
grain
gold
in
exchange
for
coin
sells
for
nine
and
ten
dollars
the
ounce
though
it
is
well
known
to
be
worth
at
the
mint
in
philadelphia
eighteen
dollars
the
ounce
at
least
such
is
the
scarcity
of
coin
here
we
want
a
mint
let
congress
send
us
one
at
once
over
the
isthmus
else
this
grain
gold
goes
to
mazatlan
to
chili
and
peru
where
it
is
lost
to
our
national
currency
over
a
million
of
gold
at
the
lowest
computation
is
taken
from
these
mines
every
month
this
quantity
will
be
more
than
doubled
when
the
emigration
from
they
states
from
oregon
the
sandwich
islands
and
the
southern
republics
arrives
send
us
a
mint
i
could
give
you
forty
more
illustrations
of
the
extent
and
productiveness
of
these
mines
but
no
one
will
believe
what
i
said
without
my
name
and
perhaps
but
few
with
it
letter
from
capt
folsom
the
latest
and
most
authentic
intelligence
from
the
gold
regions
of
california
is
the
most
interesting
and
the
best
the
following
letter
from
capt
folsom
it
will
be
seen
is
of
recent
date
and
on
perusal
the
reader
will
find
it
is
pregnant
with
valuable
facts
san
francisco
california
my
dear
sir
the
prices
of
labor
here
will
create
surprise
in
the
united
states
kannakas
or
sandwich
islanders
the
worst
of
laborers
are
now
employed
constantly
about
town
in
storing
and
landing
merchandise
at
a
dollar
an
hour
each
and
the
most
indifferent
laborers
are
hired
by
the
week
together
at
six
or
eight
dollars
per
day
mechanics
obtain
when
employed
by
the
day
eight
or
ten
dollars
per
day
and
by
the
month
about
six
in
a
few
days
as
the
sickly
season
is
over
i
presume
wages
will
advance
for
most
of
the
laboring
classes
are
returning
to
the
mines
i
have
just
completed
the
repairs
upon
a
government
lighter
preparatory
to
discharging
the
cargo
of
the
transport
ship
huntress
i
attempted
to
hire
a
lighter
to
effect
this
but
could
not
get
one
capable
of
containing
one
hundred
and
twenty
barrels
manned
by
two
men
short
of
fifty
dollars
per
day
i
have
had
the
master
of
the
government
lighter
employed
for
several
days
in
getting
a
crew
for
her
and
when
he
offers
per
month
for
sailors
he
is
laughed
at
and
told
that
a
man
can
get
that
amount
at
the
mines
in
one
day
a
few
days
since
i
sent
a
to
employ
some
men
to
handle
stores
in
the
public
warehouse
after
searching
about
the
town
in
vain
for
several
hours
he
saw
a
man
on
the
dock
whom
he
felt
sure
of
getting
for
the
individual
in
question
did
not
seem
to
be
blessed
with
a
redundancy
of
this
world
gear
he
was
wearing
a
slouched
hat
without
a
crown
a
dilapidated
buckskin
hunting
shirt
or
frock
a
very
uncleanly
red
woolen
shirt
with
pantaloons
hanging
in
tatters
and
his
feet
had
an
apology
for
a
covering
in
one
old
shoe
and
one
buckskin
moccasin
sadly
the
worse
for
wear
and
age
when
asked
if
he
wanted
employment
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
as
the
young
man
was
proceeding
to
tell
him
what
he
wished
to
have
him
do
he
was
interrupted
with
it
is
not
that
kind
of
work
sir
that
i
want
at
the
same
time
taking
a
bag
containing
about
of
gold
dust
from
his
buckskin
shirt
i
want
to
work
in
the
mines
sir
look
here
stranger
do
you
see
this
this
bag
contains
gold
dust
and
do
you
suppose
i
am
to
make
a
d
d
nigger
of
myself
handling
boxes
and
barrels
for
or
ten
dollars
per
day
i
should
think
not
stranger
and
our
friend
left
in
a
most
contemptuous
manner
nor
was
this
a
solitary
instance
of
like
conduct
they
occur
daily
and
hourly
in
this
village
all
sorts
of
labor
is
got
at
enormous
rates
of
compensation
common
clerks
and
salesmen
in
the
stores
about
town
often
receive
as
high
as
and
their
board
the
clerk
now
in
my
office
is
a
young
boy
who
until
a
few
weeks
since
was
a
of
and
i
am
now
paying
him
per
annum
this
will
not
appear
high
when
i
tell
you
that
i
have
just
seen
upon
his
table
a
wash
bill
made
out
and
paid
at
the
rate
of
eight
dollars
per
dozen
and
that
almost
every
thing
else
is
at
corresponding
prices
the
principal
waiter
in
the
hotel
where
i
board
is
paid
per
year
and
several
others
from
to
i
fortunately
have
an
indian
boy
or
i
should
be
forced
to
clean
my
own
boots
for
i
could
not
employ
a
good
body
servant
for
the
full
amount
of
my
salary
as
a
government
officer
it
will
be
impossible
for
any
army
officer
to
live
here
upon
his
pay
without
becoming
rapidly
impoverished
for
his
time
is
not
his
own
to
enter
upon
business
and
although
he
might
have
money
his
opportunities
for
making
it
useful
to
him
are
few
unless
he
invests
it
in
real
estate
unless
something
is
done
i
am
unable
to
see
how
it
is
possible
for
officers
living
upon
the
salaries
granted
by
law
to
military
men
to
support
themselves
in
this
country
i
believe
every
army
officer
in
california
with
one
or
two
exceptions
would
have
resigned
last
summer
could
they
have
done
it
and
been
free
at
once
to
commence
for
themselves
but
the
war
was
not
then
terminated
and
no
one
could
hope
to
communicate
with
washington
correspondents
to
get
an
answer
in
less
than
six
and
perhaps
ten
months
for
some
time
last
summer
august
and
july
the
officers
at
monterey
were
entirely
without
servants
and
the
governor
mason
actually
took
his
turn
in
cooking
for
his
mess
unless
some
prompt
action
is
taken
to
pay
both
officers
and
men
serving
in
this
country
in
proportion
to
the
unavoidable
expenses
to
be
incurred
the
former
will
resign
and
the
latter
will
desert
and
it
will
be
impossible
to
maintain
a
military
force
in
california
i
look
upon
california
as
perhaps
the
richest
mineral
country
on
the
globe
i
have
written
you
at
great
length
as
to
the
gold
and
since
the
date
of
that
letter
other
and
richer
mines
have
been
discovered
rich
silver
mines
are
known
to
exist
in
various
parts
of
the
country
but
they
are
not
worked
quicksilver
mines
are
found
at
innumerable
places
and
many
of
them
afford
the
richest
ores
the
new
almadin
mine
at
santa
clara
gives
the
richest
ore
of
which
we
have
any
accounts
with
very
imperfect
machinery
it
yields
upward
of
fifty
per
cent
and
the
proprietors
are
now
working
it
and
are
preparing
to
quadruple
their
force
iron
copper
lead
tin
sulphur
zinc
platinum
cobalt
are
said
to
be
found
in
abundance
and
most
of
them
are
known
to
exist
in
various
sections
of
the
country
as
an
agricultural
territory
its
great
disadvantage
is
a
want
of
rain
but
this
is
by
no
means
so
great
as
has
been
represented
i
believe
california
can
be
made
to
produce
as
fine
wheat
rye
oats
buckwheat
barley
vegetables
and
fruits
especially
grapes
as
any
portion
of
the
world
nothing
that
has
been
fairly
tried
has
failed
and
nearly
every
thing
has
produced
wonderfully
the
portions
of
the
soil
which
are
capable
of
cultivation
are
inconsiderable
in
comparison
with
the
whole
area
of
the
country
but
the
soil
about
this
bay
and
in
many
of
the
large
valleys
is
equal
to
the
wants
of
a
dense
population
it
is
proverbially
healthy
and
with
the
exception
of
portions
of
the
sacramento
and
san
joaquin
valleys
no
country
ever
had
at
the
same
period
of
its
settlement
a
more
salubrious
climate
i
think
california
affords
means
for
the
investment
of
capital
such
as
few
other
countries
offer
any
person
who
could
come
in
here
now
with
ready
cash
would
be
certain
of
doubling
his
money
in
a
few
months
large
fortunes
will
be
made
here
within
the
ensuing
year
and
i
am
told
that
there
are
some
hundreds
of
persons
who
have
already
made
on
an
average
each
whole
cargoes
of
goods
are
sold
at
an
average
of
about
per
cent
clear
profit
and
ready
pay
in
gold
dust
when
i
came
to
this
place
i
expended
a
few
hundred
dollars
in
waste
lots
covered
with
bushes
and
sand
hills
the
chapter
of
events
which
has
followed
is
likely
to
make
this
property
quite
valuable
if
i
am
able
to
look
after
it
what
cost
me
less
than
i
suppose
i
could
now
sell
for
or
perhaps
it
is
this
consideration
which
makes
me
willing
to
return
to
a
country
where
my
salary
is
insufficient
for
my
support
if
congress
does
not
increase
the
pay
of
officers
serving
here
i
should
still
be
willing
to
return
in
the
expectation
that
my
private
interests
would
justify
a
measure
which
would
otherwise
be
certain
to
impoverish
me
something
should
be
done
here
at
once
for
the
establishment
of
peace
and
good
order
in
the
country
all
law
both
civil
and
military
is
at
an
end
among
the
mines
and
indeed
in
most
parts
of
the
country
out
of
the
villages
no
authority
but
that
of
the
strongest
exists
and
outrages
of
the
most
disgraceful
nature
are
constantly
occurring
and
the
offenders
go
unpunished
there
are
now
about
vessels
in
this
port
and
i
believe
there
is
not
one
of
them
that
has
a
crew
to
go
to
sea
frequently
the
sailors
arm
themselves
take
the
ship
boats
and
leave
in
the
most
open
manner
defying
both
their
officers
and
the
civil
magistrates
these
things
are
disgraceful
to
the
country
and
the
flag
and
while
vessels
have
to
pay
port
charges
duties
their
owners
ought
to
be
protected
the
tariff
law
of
is
now
in
force
in
california
we
have
not
had
an
american
in
this
port
for
more
than
a
year
and
all
the
naval
resources
of
the
united
states
on
this
coast
are
concentrated
at
monterey
which
is
not
a
harbor
but
an
open
roadstead
and
which
has
not
of
the
business
on
its
waters
which
is
done
in
this
bay
during
the
whole
year
that
i
was
collector
of
this
port
there
was
not
a
gun
mounted
for
commanding
the
entrance
of
the
port
and
there
was
not
a
united
states
in
the
harbor
we
were
exacting
a
military
contribution
and
we
possessed
not
the
slightest
means
of
preventing
vessels
from
leaving
in
defiance
of
our
authority
in
a
few
months
the
line
of
ocean
mail
steamers
will
be
in
operation
from
panama
to
oregon
and
this
port
is
to
be
a
depot
for
coal
and
of
course
a
stopping
point
in
passing
both
ways
the
starting
of
the
line
of
steamers
on
this
coast
is
likely
to
be
an
undertaking
of
very
great
difficulty
and
at
this
time
such
is
its
importance
with
reference
to
both
oregon
and
california
that
its
failure
might
be
looked
upon
as
a
national
calamity
still
unless
some
kind
of
protection
is
extended
to
the
shipping
of
this
port
it
is
not
at
all
improbable
that
it
may
fail
for
want
of
the
necessary
laborers
as
soon
as
the
boats
reach
this
harbor
indeed
it
is
altogether
probable
unless
some
competent
authority
is
found
here
at
the
time
to
preserve
order
that
the
crew
will
quit
in
a
body
as
soon
as
the
first
vessel
arrives
every
possible
assistance
should
be
extended
to
insure
the
success
of
this
company
and
every
reasonable
latitude
should
be
granted
in
the
execution
of
their
contract
it
is
now
uncertain
if
the
steamers
can
enter
columbia
river
at
all
times
in
the
winter
and
they
may
find
it
necessary
to
run
up
to
paget
sound
this
would
be
a
small
inconvenience
in
comparison
to
the
loss
of
one
of
these
vessels
upon
the
very
dangerous
bar
at
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
an
event
not
at
all
improbable
if
they
enter
that
river
in
the
winter
newspaper
correspondence
the
following
letters
were
communicated
to
the
californian
newspaper
and
exhibit
very
graphically
the
state
of
excitement
and
the
actual
state
of
things
in
the
gold
regions
during
last
summer
new
helvetia
june
i
have
just
returned
from
fort
sacramento
from
the
gold
region
from
whence
i
write
this
and
in
compliance
with
my
promise
on
leaving
the
sea
coast
i
send
you
such
items
as
i
have
gathered
our
trip
after
leaving
your
city
by
way
of
pueblo
san
jose
and
the
san
joaquin
river
we
found
very
agreeable
passing
over
a
lovely
country
with
its
valleys
and
hills
covered
with
the
richest
verdure
intertwined
with
flowers
of
every
hue
the
country
from
the
san
joaquin
river
to
this
place
is
rich
beyond
comparison
and
will
admit
of
a
dense
population
we
found
the
fort
a
miniature
manchester
a
young
lowell
the
blacksmith
hammer
the
tinner
the
carpenter
and
the
shuttle
plying
by
the
ingenuity
of
indians
at
which
place
there
are
several
hundred
in
the
employ
of
capt
sutter
i
was
much
pleased
with
a
walk
in
a
large
and
beautiful
garden
attached
to
the
fort
it
contains
about
eight
or
ten
acres
laid
out
with
great
taste
under
the
supervision
of
a
young
swiss
among
the
fruit
trees
i
noticed
the
almond
fig
olive
pear
apple
and
peach
the
grape
vines
are
in
the
highest
state
of
cultivation
and
for
vegetables
i
would
refer
you
to
a
seedman
catalogue
about
three
miles
from
the
fort
on
the
east
bank
of
the
sacramento
the
town
of
suttersville
is
laid
out
the
location
is
one
of
the
best
in
the
country
situated
in
the
largest
and
most
fertile
district
in
california
and
being
the
depot
for
the
extensive
gold
silver
platina
quicksilver
and
iron
mines
a
hotel
is
now
building
for
the
accomodation
of
the
travelling
public
who
are
now
obliged
to
impose
on
the
kind
hospitalities
of
capt
sutter
a
party
of
men
who
have
been
exploring
a
route
to
cross
the
sierra
nevada
mountains
have
just
returned
and
report
that
they
have
found
a
good
wagon
road
on
the
declivity
ridge
between
the
american
fork
and
the
mccossamy
rivers
the
distance
being
much
less
than
by
the
old
route
the
road
will
pass
through
the
gold
district
and
enter
the
valley
near
the
american
fork
a
ferry
is
to
be
established
at
suttersville
on
the
sacramento
and
the
road
across
the
improved
soon
which
will
shorten
the
distance
from
this
place
to
sonoma
and
your
city
about
miles
after
leaving
the
fort
we
passed
up
on
the
south
bank
of
the
american
fork
about
twelve
miles
this
is
a
beautiful
river
about
three
fathoms
deep
the
water
being
very
cold
and
clear
and
after
leaving
the
river
we
passed
through
a
country
rolling
and
timbered
with
oak
we
soon
commenced
ascending
the
hills
at
the
base
of
the
sierra
nevada
which
are
thickly
set
with
oak
and
pine
timber
and
soon
arrived
at
a
small
rivulet
one
of
our
party
dipped
up
a
cupful
of
sand
from
the
bed
of
the
creek
washed
it
and
found
five
pieces
of
gold
this
was
our
first
attempt
at
gold
digging
about
dark
we
arrived
at
the
of
captain
sutter
having
ridden
over
gold
silver
platina
and
iron
mines
some
twenty
or
thirty
miles
the
past
three
days
i
have
spent
in
exploring
the
mountains
in
this
district
and
conversing
with
many
men
who
have
been
at
work
here
for
some
weeks
past
should
i
attempt
to
relate
to
you
all
that
i
have
seen
and
have
been
told
concerning
the
extent
and
productions
of
the
mines
i
am
fearful
your
readers
would
think
me
exaggerating
too
much
therefore
i
will
keep
within
bounds
i
could
fill
your
columns
with
the
most
astonishing
tales
concerning
the
mines
here
far
excelling
the
arabian
nights
and
all
true
to
the
letter
as
near
as
i
can
ascertain
there
are
now
about
persons
engaged
and
the
roads
leading
to
the
mines
are
thronged
with
people
and
wagons
from
one
to
nine
ounces
of
pure
virgin
gold
per
day
is
gathered
by
every
man
who
performs
the
requisite
labor
the
mountains
have
been
explored
for
about
forty
miles
and
gold
has
been
found
in
great
abundance
in
almost
every
part
of
them
a
gentleman
informed
me
that
he
had
spent
some
time
in
exploring
the
country
and
had
dug
holes
with
his
butcher
knife
in
different
places
and
found
gold
in
every
one
several
extensive
silver
mines
have
been
discovered
but
very
little
attention
is
paid
to
them
now
immense
beds
of
iron
ore
of
superior
quality
yielding
to
per
have
also
been
found
near
the
american
fork
a
grist
mill
is
to
be
attached
to
the
saw
mill
for
the
purpose
of
convenience
of
families
and
others
settling
at
the
mines
the
water
power
of
the
american
fork
is
equal
to
any
upon
this
continent
and
in
a
few
years
large
iron
founderies
rolling
splitting
and
nail
mills
will
be
erected
the
granite
of
the
mountains
is
superior
to
the
celebrated
quincy
a
quarry
of
beautiful
marble
has
been
discovered
near
the
mccossanny
river
specimens
of
which
you
will
see
in
a
few
years
in
the
front
of
the
custom
house
merchants
exchange
city
hall
and
other
edifices
in
your
flourishing
city
the
cry
is
still
they
come
two
men
have
just
arrived
for
provisions
from
the
abjuba
river
who
state
that
they
have
worked
five
days
and
gathered
in
gold
the
largest
piece
weighing
nearly
one
ounce
they
report
the
quantity
on
that
river
to
be
immense
and
in
much
larger
pieces
than
that
taken
in
other
parts
sonoma
the
mining
fever
is
raging
here
as
well
as
elsewhere
not
a
mechanic
or
laboring
man
can
be
obtained
in
town
and
most
of
our
male
citizens
have
gone
up
to
the
sierra
nevada
and
are
now
enjoying
golden
moments
spades
shovels
hoes
bottles
vials
brass
tubes
earthern
jars
and
even
barrels
have
been
put
in
requisition
and
have
also
abruptly
left
town
i
have
heard
from
one
of
our
citizens
who
has
been
at
the
gold
placer
a
few
weeks
and
he
had
collected
worth
of
the
root
of
evil
and
was
still
averaging
per
day
another
gent
wife
and
boy
collected
worth
in
one
day
another
still
who
shut
up
his
hotel
here
some
five
or
six
weeks
since
has
returned
with
in
pure
virgin
gold
collected
by
his
own
exertions
with
no
other
aid
than
a
spade
pick
and
indian
basket
three
new
and
valuable
lead
mines
have
recently
been
discovered
in
this
vicinity
and
one
of
our
citizens
john
bowles
of
galena
a
gent
who
has
been
reported
by
the
boston
press
as
having
been
murdered
by
the
indians
on
the
southern
route
to
oregon
from
the
states
informed
me
that
the
ore
would
yield
per
and
that
it
was
his
intention
to
erect
as
soon
as
practicable
six
large
smelting
furnaces
the
colonnade
theatre
at
this
place
has
closed
for
the
season
it
was
well
attended
however
from
the
time
the
thespians
made
their
debut
till
they
made
their
exit
the
golden
farmer
the
omnibus
and
a
russian
comedy
called
feodora
translated
from
the
german
of
kotzebue
by
linz
of
sonoma
were
their
last
attractions
the
military
company
under
command
of
capt
brackett
are
today
exchanging
posts
with
company
under
command
of
captain
frisbie
both
of
the
new
york
volunteers
company
has
been
stationed
with
us
more
than
a
year
and
much
praise
is
due
its
members
not
only
for
the
military
and
manner
in
which
they
have
acquitted
themselves
as
a
corps
but
for
their
gentlemanly
and
orderly
deportment
individually
and
collectively
we
regret
to
part
with
them
and
can
not
let
them
go
without
expressing
a
hope
that
when
peace
shall
have
been
declared
their
regiment
disbanded
and
their
country
no
longer
needs
their
services
they
may
have
fallen
sufficiently
in
love
with
our
healthy
climate
and
our
beautiful
valley
to
come
back
and
settle
gold
the
new
york
has
an
article
upon
this
subject
from
which
we
take
the
following
the
places
where
it
is
found
are
much
more
numerous
than
we
might
at
first
suppose
the
mines
of
america
however
surpass
those
of
all
other
countries
though
of
comparative
newness
they
have
furnished
three
times
and
a
half
more
gold
and
twelve
times
more
silver
than
those
of
the
old
world
silver
and
gold
were
before
the
discovery
of
america
supposed
to
bear
to
each
other
the
relation
of
to
in
europe
the
proportion
is
now
about
to
the
gold
of
mexico
is
chiefly
found
in
argentiferous
veins
as
at
guanaxuato
where
it
is
obtained
one
ounce
in
the
only
auriferous
veins
worked
as
such
are
at
oaxaca
the
rivers
in
caraccas
flow
over
auriferous
sands
peru
is
not
reported
rich
in
gold
at
present
the
gold
of
new
grenada
is
found
in
alluvial
soil
and
is
washed
out
in
the
shape
of
spangles
and
grains
the
gold
of
chili
is
found
under
similar
circumstances
brazil
formerly
brought
the
most
gold
to
market
not
even
excepting
russia
which
now
however
surpasses
her
all
the
rivers
running
from
the
brazilian
mountains
have
gold
and
the
annual
product
of
fine
metal
is
now
rated
at
there
are
no
very
late
tables
of
the
products
of
the
american
mines
we
have
ascertained
by
accident
purely
how
the
estimate
is
made
at
present
from
to
forty
years
the
product
of
mexico
was
gold
silver
chili
gold
silver
buenos
ayres
gold
silver
add
to
this
russia
gold
silver
and
we
have
from
four
countries
alone
millions
of
pounds
sterling
or
millions
per
annum
if
we
add
the
products
of
europe
and
asiatic
russia
of
the
east
indies
and
africa
which
some
estimate
at
tons
of
gold
per
annum
we
perceive
that
a
vast
amount
of
the
precious
metal
is
unearthed
and
somewhere
in
use
the
relative
value
of
gold
has
certainly
changed
very
much
within
a
few
hundred
years
and
it
probably
will
change
still
more
but
we
do
not
think
it
is
likely
to
depreciate
in
our
time
for
many
reasons
though
some
persons
imagine
it
will
the
true
secret
of
all
this
present
excitement
is
this

first
time

their
history

gold
mines
of
very
great
value
hitherto
africans
asiatic
or
indians
have
held
them
and
they
have
never
shown
that
ardor
combined
with
perseverance
which
belongs
to
us
england
never
had
any
mines
of
gold
or
she
would
have
worked
them
as
diligently
as
she
has
those
of
coal
the
americans
have
now
a
golden
chance
and
they
are
the
first
of
their
blood
that
have
ever
had
it
they
will
be
sure
to
turn
the
opportunity
to
account
at
our
leisure
we
will
refer
to
some
other
interesting
facts
in
relation
to
the
value
of
gold
at
different
periods
we
conclude
with
recalling
one
singular
circumstance
to
the
recollection
of
our
readers
that
when
the
romans
captured
jerusalem
they
obtained
so
much
gold
that
the
price
of
it
in
syria
fell
one
half
lieutenant
loeser
of
the
third
artillery
a
graduate
of
west
point
furnishes
the
following
information
respecting
the
gold
region
we
have
been
favored
by
lieutenant
loeser
bearer
of
dispatches
from
governor
mason
to
the
government
at
washington
who
also
brought
on
about
of
gold
dust
which
he
deposited
at
washington
with
a
general
description
of
the
gold
region
the
climate
of
california
he
says
the
gold
region
is
very
large
and
there
is
sufficient
ore
to
profitably
employ
one
hundred
thousand
persons
for
generations
to
come
so
far
as
discovered
the
gold
is
found
in
an
extent
of
country
four
hundred
miles
long
by
one
hundred
and
fifty
wide
and
no
particular
portion
seems
more
productive
than
another
in
the
river
and
on
the
flatlands
the
gold
dust
is
found
but
among
the
rocks
and
in
the
highlands
it
is
found
in
lumps
from
the
size
of
a
man
hand
to
the
size
of
an
ordinary
all
of
which
is
solid
and
presents
the
appearance
of
having
been
thrown
up
by
a
volcanic
eruption
so
plenty
is
the
gold
that
little
care
is
paid
to
the
washing
of
it
by
those
engaged
when
he
left
the
consequence
of
which
is
great
quantities
are
thrown
away
in
the
highlands
he
was
walking
with
a
man
who
found
a
piece
weighing
about
pennyweights
worth
but
which
he
purchased
for
the
piece
is
solid
and
has
the
form
of
a
perfect
acorn
on
the
top
of
it
he
has
had
it
just
as
it
was
found
converted
into
a
breastpin
a
man
by
ordinary
labor
may
procure
from
to
per
day
with
regard
to
the
climate
he
says
it
is
salubrious
at
no
time
being
so
cold
as
to
require
more
than
a
light
blanket
to
sleep
under
when
he
left
the
people
were
sleeping
under
the
trees
without
the
fear
of
sickness
from
exposure
the
rainy
season
begins
about
the
first
of
november
and
continues
until
march
though
there
are
five
clear
days
for
every
rainy
one
provisions
are
generally
high
at
least
such
as
can
not
be
obtained
in
the
country
flour
is
worth
per
barrel
though
a
fine
bullock
may
be
obtained
for
clothing
is
very
high
and
the
demand
is
very
great
the
indians
who
have
heretofore
used
no
clothing
whatever
now
endeavor
to
imitate
the
whites
and
will
give
any
price
for
garments
the
report
relative
to
the
mormons
requiring
per
cent
of
all
the
gold
found
he
says
is
a
mistake
when
the
gold
was
first
discovered
one
of
the
leaders
of
that
people
demanded
that
amount
from
all
the
mormons
but
they
remonstrated
and
refused
to
pay
it
which
remonstrance
caused
not
the
slightest
difficulty
among
the
people
he
was
in
san
francisco
when
the
gold
was
first
discovered
about
forty
miles
from
that
place
the
news
was
received
one
day
and
the
following
morning
out
of
the
whole
company
to
which
he
was
attached
every
one
deserted
except
two
sergeants
and
took
with
them
all
the
horses
belonging
to
the
officers
in
a
few
days
the
city
was
almost
entirely
deserted
and
mason
the
governor
of
the
territory
was
and
has
ever
since
been
obliged
to
prepare
and
cook
his
own
food
a
servant
can
not
be
had
at
any
price
and
the
soldiers
have
not
sufficient
pay
for
a
month
to
subsist
on
for
a
week
the
salary
of
the
governor
is
not
sufficient
to
support
him
and
like
all
others
in
the
more
wealthy
circles
of
life
he
is
obliged
to
be
his
own
servant
he
speaks
of
the
country
as
offering
the
greatest
inducements
to
young
men
of
enterprise
and
thinks
there
is
ample
room
and
gold
for
hundreds
of
thousands
advice
to
those
going
to
california
by
the
capes
the
following
article
condensed
from
correspondence
in
a
daily
paper
of
new
york
city
will
be
found
to
contain
many
valuable
hints
to
the
california
bound
traveler
it
came
to
hand
too
late
to
appear
in
its
proper
place
where
the
four
different
routes
are
spoken
of
the
first
grand
desideratum
is
to
secure
comfort
on
the
passage
by
the
most
efficient
and
economical
means
thereby
as
far
as
possible
insuring
the
arrival
of
the
company
at
their
destination
in
good
health
and
condition
to
insure
the
most
perfect
health
and
comfort
attainable
on
so
long
a
voyage
a
vessel
should
not
be
fitted
up
as
our
european
passenger
ships
are
with
bunks
for
the
passengers
to
sleep
in
but
the
berth
deck
should
be
free
from
bulkheads
fore
and
aft
this
arrangement
would
give
plenty
of
room
for
the
company
to
swing
their
hammocks
or
cots
which
could
be
stowed
on
deck
in
pleasant
weather
leaving
the
berth
deck
free
from
encumbrance
for
the
company
to
amuse
themselves
with
conversation
or
exercise
such
an
arrangement
would
secure
a
more
perfect
ventilation
a
very
important
consideration
than
bunks
could
possibly
admit
of
as
bunks
unavoidably
harbor
filth
and
vermin
besides
leaving
very
little
room
for
the
exercise
so
absolutely
necessary
in
preventing
the
diseases
incident
to
a
protracted
voyage
before
the
company
proceeds
on
the
voyage
each
member
should
subscribe
to
a
code
of
regulations
and
officers
be
appointed
to
carry
them
into
effect
this
arrangement
should
be
made
in
order
to
obviate
the
vexation
and
annoyance
which
inevitably
occur
wherever
a
large
number
of
persons
are
promiscuously
on
shipboard
a
simple
system
such
as
regularity
of
meals
and
cleansing
the
interior
of
the
ship
similar
to
the
navy
regulations
in
that
particular
are
indispensible
and
will
contribute
much
to
the
pleasure
comfort
health
and
good
fellowship
of
all
on
board
the
company
should
be
composed
of
agriculturists
mechanics
and
artisans
as
equal
in
pecuniary
condition
and
as
circumstances
will
admit
and
it
would
be
very
important
for
the
most
useful
and
necessary
arts
to
be
well
represented
by
such
an
organization
the
company
would
be
very
efficient
for
by
taking
on
board
cloth
leather
iron
lumber
brick
their
clothing
shoes
iron
and
wood
work
of
a
brick
house
might
be
made
on
board
and
would
employ
the
various
mechanics
connected
with
those
arts
would
tend
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
the
ocean
and
practically
the
benefits
and
many
of
a
true
of
interests
the
agricultural
implements
of
the
most
approved
method
together
with
the
choicest
varieties
of
young
fruit
trees
and
garden
seeds
should
be
provided
instead
of
the
usual
ballast
for
the
vessel
brick
and
lime
if
necessary
could
be
taken
for
that
purpose
which
might
be
used
by
the
company
or
disposed
of
to
great
advantage
at
san
francisco
the
vessel
might
be
profitably
employed
in
transporting
passengers
to
and
from
the
isthmus
with
great
profit
to
the
company
of
which
the
officers
and
ship
company
should
be
members
a
should
belong
to
the
association
every
member
of
the
company
should
contribute
all
the
useful
books
he
could
as
a
library
on
would
be
a
constant
source
of
amusement
and
instruction
persons
about
embarking
on
so
long
a
voyage
should
be
very
particular
and
have
their
provisions
carefully
put
up
the
united
states

be
found
to
be
very

any

it
it
is
only
necessary
to

is
the
best
and

be
put
