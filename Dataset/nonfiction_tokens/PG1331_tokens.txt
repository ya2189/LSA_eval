these

coming

making
a
whirlwind
which
concentrates

thus
forming

babies
were
nourished
in

deposits
the

this
nourishment
came
from
the
abundance
of
albumen
which
accompanied
the
semen
in
concentrating
as
the
babies
matured
they
broke
the
crust
of
the
deposit
of

and
put
forth
their
heads
and
breathed
the
air
their
bodies
still
remained
in

albumen
until

gained

themselves
on

that
brought

applying
himself
to
most
anything
he
cares
to
do
but
little
attention
is
paid
to
the
training
of
animal
magnetism
any
one
with
nerves
in
his
teeth
can
concentrate
magnetism
in
the
teeth
so
it
can
be
easily
felt
also
the
lips
by
training
the
magnetism
it
can
be
concentrated
in
any
part
of
the
body
this
takes
constant
practice
and
could
be
used
when
one
has
any
disability
by
concentrating
the
magnetism
in
the
disabled
part
causing
the
blood
to
circulate
more
freely
at
the
point
where
the
magnetism
is
concentrated

lightning
is
caused
by
the
friction
of
vapor
which
is
at
a
suitable
temperature
thus
two
or
more
currents
of
air
coming
together
will
cause
lightning
as
the
friction
concentrates
the
electricity
and
as
there
is
no
conductor
the
heavy
voltage
flies
usually
toward
the
nearest
conductor
this
voltage
is

that

restoring
science
that

thousands
of
years
before
the
cultivation
of
knowledge
by
experiment
observation
and

discussions
this
was
the
birth

many
thousands
