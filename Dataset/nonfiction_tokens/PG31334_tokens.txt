by

field
studies
on
hylid
frogs
in
southern
méxico
and
northern
central
america
have
resulted
in
the
collection
of
numerous
specimens
of
a
genus
of
hylid
frogs
heretofore
poorly
represented
in
museum
collections
experience
with
the
living
frogs
in
their
natural
habitats
has
been
helpful
in
defining
the
species
and
in
formulating
ideas
concerning
their
relationships
taylor
proposed
the
generic
name
for
a
new
species
of
frog
ahl
duellman
from
agua
del
obispo
guerrero
taylor
defined
the
genus
as
having
large
ventrolateral
glands
and
horny
nuptial
spines
in
males
stuart
discussed
the
generic
characters
and
pointed
out
that
both
the
ventrolateral
glands
and
horny
nuptial
spines
were
seasonal
in
their
development
being
found
only
in
breeding
males
stuart
then
went
on
to
describe
a
species
characterized
by
the
absence
of
horny
nuptial
spines
in
breeding
males
my
investigations
of
these
frogs
have
revealed
the
presence
of
two
groups
of
species
in
both
groups
breeding
males
have
large
ventrolateral
glands
but
the
two
groups
are
easily
separated
by
four
characters
the
first
group
contains
among
others
and
another
species
in
the
mesa
central
of
chiapas
to
which
i
tentatively
apply
the
name
tanner
this
group
of
species
is
characterized
by
horny
nuptial
spines
in
breeding
males
presence
of
a
tarsal
fold
a
call
consisting
of
a
single
long
note
and
tadpoles
having
lips
not
greatly
expanded
the
second
group
as
recognized
here
is
characterized
by
the
absence
of
horny
nuptial
spines
in
breeding
males
lack
of
a
tarsal
fold
a
call
consisting
of
a
series
of
short
notes
and
tadpoles
having
greatly
expanded
lips
in
this
group
belong
and
the
two
species
described
below
only
the
descriptions
of
the

are
