my
record
has
so
far
stated
what
the
romans
both
did
and
endured
for
seven
hundred
and
years
under
the
monarchy
as
a
democracy
and
beneath
the
rule
of
a
few
after
this
they
reverted
to
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
state
of
monarchy
again
although
cæsar
had
a
plan
to
lay
down
his
arms
and
entrust
affairs
to
the
senate
and
the
populace
he
held
a
consultation
on
the
subject
with
agrippa
and
mæcenas
to
whom
he
communicated
all
his
secrets
agrippa
first
of
the
two
answered
him
as
follows
be
not
surprised
cæsar
if
i
try
to
turn
your
mind
away
from
monarchy
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
i
might
enjoy
many
advantages
from
it
if
you
held
the
place
if
it
were
going
to
prove
serviceable
to
you
i
should
be
thoroughly
enthusiastic
for
it
but
those
who
hold
supreme
power
are
not
in
a
like
position
with
their
friends
the
latter
without
incurring
jealousy
or
danger
reap
all
the
benefits
they
please
whereas
jealousies
and
dangers
are
the
lot
of
the
former
i
have
thought
it
right
as
in
other
cases
to
look
forward
not
for
my
own
interest
but
for
yours
and
the
public
let
us
consider
leisurely
all
the
features
of
the
system
of
government
and
turn
whichever
way
our
reflection
may
direct
us
for
it
will
not
be
asserted
that
we
ought
to
choose
it
under
any
and
all
circumstances
even
if
it
be
not
advantageous
otherwise
we
shall
seem
to
have
been
unable
to
bear
good
fortune
and
to
have
gone
mad
through
our
successes
or
else
to
have
been
aiming
at
it
long
since
to
have
used
our
father
and
our
devotion
to
him
as
a
mere
screen
to
have
put
the
people
and
the
senate
forward
as
an
excuse
our
object
will
seem
to
have
been
not
to
free
them
from
conspirators
but
to
enslave
them
to
ourselves
either
supposition
entails
censure
who
would
not
be
indignant
to
see
that
we
had
spoken
words
of
one
tenor
but
to
ascertain
that
we
had
had
something
different
in
mind
how
much
more
would
he
hate
us
now
than
if
we
had
at
the
outset
laid
bare
our
desires
and
aimed
straight
at
the
monarchy
it
has
come
to
be
generally
believed
that
to
adopt
some
violent
course
belongs
somehow
to
the
nature
of
man
even
if
it
involves
taking
an
unfair
advantage
every
person
who
excels
in
any
business
thinks
it
right
that
he
should
enjoy
more
advantages
than
his
inferior
if
he
meets
with
a
success
he
ascribes
it
to
the
force
of
his
individual
temperament
and
if
he
fails
in
anything
he
refers
it
to
the
workings
of
the
supernatural
a
man
however
who
tries
to
gain
advancement
by
plots
and
injuries
is
in
the
first
place
held
to
be
crafty
and
crooked
malicious
and
vicious
and
this
i
know
you
would
allow
no
one
to
say
or
think
about
you
even
if
you
might
rule
the
whole
world
by
it
again
if
he
succeeds
he
is
thought
to
have
gained
an
unjust
advantage
and
if
he
fails
to
have
met
with
merited
misfortune
this
being
so
any
one
might
reproach
us
quite
as
much
even
if
we
had
nothing
of
the
sort
in
mind
at
the
beginning
and
were
to
begin
to
devise
it
only
now
for
to
let
the
situation
get
the
better
of
us
and
not
restrain
ourselves
and
not
make
a
right
use
of
the
gifts
of
fortune
is
much
worse
than
for
a
man
to
do
wrong
through
the
latter
sort
are
often
compelled
by
their
very
disasters
and
in
consideration
of
their
own
need
of
profit
to
behave
against
their
will
in
an
irregular
way
the
others
voluntarily
abandon
even
if
to
do
so
is
contrary
to
their
own
interests
and
when
men
neither
have
any
love
of
simplicity
in
their
souls
nor
are
able
to
show
moderation
in
regard
to
the
blessings
bestowed
upon
them
how
could
one
expect
that
they
would
either
rule
well
over
others
or
behave
themselves
uprightly
in
trouble
let
us
make
our
decision
on
the
basis
that
we
are
in
neither
of
the
classes
mentioned
and
do
not
desire
to
act
in
any
way
unreasonably
but
will
choose
whatever
course
after
deliberation
appears
to
us
best
i
shall
speak
quite
frankly
for
i
could
not
for
my
part
express
myself
in
any
other
way
and
i
am
aware
that
you
do
not
enjoy
hearing
lies
mingled
with
flattery
equality
before
the
law
has
a
pleasant
name
and
its
results
are
a
triumph
of
justice
if
you
take
men
who
have
received
the
same
nature
are
of
kindred
race
to
one
another
have
been
brought
up
under
the
same
institutions
have
been
trained
in
laws
that
are
alike
and
yield
in
common
the
service
of
their
bodies
and
of
their
minds
to
the
same
state
is
it
not
just
that
they
should
have
all
other
things
too
in
common
is
it
not
best
that
they
should
secure
no
superior
honors
except
as
a
result
of
excellence
equality
of
birth
strives
for
equality
of
possessions
and
if
it
attains
it
is
glad
but
if
it
misses
is
displeased
and
human
nature
everywhere
because
it
is
sprung
from
the
gods
and
is
to
return
to
the
gods
gazes
upward
and
is
not
content
to
be
ruled
forever
by
the
same
person
nor
will
it
endure
to
share
in
the
toils
the
dangers
the
expenditures
and
be
deprived
of
partnership
in
higher
matters
or
if
it
is
forced
to
submit
to
such
conditions
it
hates
the
power
which
has
applied
coercion
and
if
it
obtains
an
opportunity
takes
vengeance
on
what
it
hates
all
men
think
they
ought
to
rule
and
for
this
reason
submit
to
being
ruled
in
turn
they
do
not
wish
to
be
defrauded
and
therefore
do
not
insist
on
defrauding
others
they
are
pleased
with
honors
bestowed
by
their
peers
and
approve
the
penalties
inflicted
by
their
laws
if
they
conduct
their
government
on
these
lines
and
believe
that
profits
and
the
opposite
shall
be
shared
in
common
they
wish
no
harm
to
happen
to
any
one
of
the
citizens
and
devoutly
hope
that
all
good
things
may
fall
to
the
lot
of
all
of
them
if
one
of
them
himself
possesses
any
excellence
he
makes
it
known
without
hesitation
practices
it
enthusiastically
and
exhibits
it
very
gladly
or
if
he
sees
it
in
another
he
readily
advances
it
is
eager
to
increase
it
and
honors
it
most
brilliantly
on
the
other
hand
if
any
one
deteriorates
everybody
hates
him
if
one
meets
misfortune
everybody
pities
him
each
person
regards
the
loss
or
shame
that
such
cause
to
be
a
common
detriment
to
the
city
this
is
the
constitution
of
democracies
under
tyrannies
exactly
the
opposite
conditions
are
found
it
is
useless
to
go
at
length
into
all
of
the
details
but
the
chief
feature
is
that
no
one
is
willing
to
seem
to
know
or
possess
anything
good
because
the
whole
ruling
power
generally
becomes
hostile
to
him
in
such
a
case
every
one
else
takes
the
tyrant
behavior
as
a
standard
of
life
and
pursues
whatever
objects
he
may
hope
to
gain
through
him
by
taking
advantage
of
his
neighbor
while
incurring
no
danger
himself
consequently
the
majority
of
the
people
have
an
eye
only
to
their
own
interests
and
hate
all
other
citizens
they
esteem
their
neighbor
good
fortune
as
a
personal
loss
and
his
misfortunes
as
a
personal
gain
such
being
the
state
of
the
case
i
do
not
see
what
could
possibly
incite
you
to
become
sole
ruler
besides
the
fact
that
that
system
is
disagreeable
to
democracies
it
would
be
far
more
unpleasant
still
to
yourself
you
surely
see
how
the
city
and
its
affairs
are
even
now
in
a
state
of
turmoil
it
is
difficult
also
to
overthrow
our
populace
which
has
lived
during
so
many
years
in
freedom
and
difficult
since
so
many
enemies
confront
us
round
about
to
reduce
again
to
slavery
the
allies
and
the
subject
nations
which
from
of
old
have
been
democratic
communities
and
were
set
free
by
our
own
selves
to
begin
first
with
the
smallest
matter
it
will
be
requisite
that
you
procure
a
large
supply
of
money
from
all
sides
it
is
impossible
that
our
present
revenues
should
suffice
for
the
very
expenses
and
particularly
for
the
support
of
the
soldiers
this
need
exists
also
in
democracies
for
it
is
not
possible
to
organize
any
government
without
expense
but
under
such
a
system
many
give
largely
in
addition
to
what
is
required
and
do
it
frequently
making
it
a
matter
of
rivalry
and
securing
proper
honors
for
their
liberality
or
if
perchance
there
are
compulsory
levies
upon
everybody
they
endure
it
because
they
can
persuade
themselves
that
it
is
wise
and
because
they
are
contributing
in
their
own
behalf
under
sovereignties
they
think
that
the
ruling
power
alone
to
which
they
credit
boundless
wealth
should
bear
the
expense
they
are
very
ready
to
search
out
the
ruler
sources
of
income
but
do
not
make
a
similar
careful
calculation
about
the
outgo
they
are
not
inclined
to
pay
out
anything
extra
personally
and
of
their
own
free
will
nor
will
they
hear
of
voluntary
public
contributions
the
former
course
no
one
would
choose
because
he
would
not
readily
admit
that
he
was
rich
and
it
is
not
to
the
advantage
of
the
ruler
to
have
it
happen
so
liberal
a
citizen
would
immediately
acquire
a
reputation
for
patriotism
among
the
mass
of
the
people
would
become
conceited
and
cause
a
disturbance
in
politics
on
the
other
hand
a
general
levy
weighs
heavily
upon
them
all
and
chiefly
because
they
endure
the
loss
whereas
others
take
the
gain
in
democracies
those
who
contribute
money
as
a
general
rule
also
serve
in
the
army
so
that
in
a
way
they
get
it
back
again
but
in
monarchies
one
set
of
people
usually
farm
manufacture
carry
on
maritime
enterprises
engage
in
politics
the
principal
pursuits
by
which
fortunes
are
secured
and
a
different
set
are
under
arms
and
draw
pay
this
single
necessity
then
which
is
of
such
importance
will
cause
you
trouble
here
is
another
it
is
by
all
means
essential
that
whoever
from
time
to
time
commits
a
crime
should
pay
some
penalty
the
majority
of
men
are
not
brought
to
reason
by
suggestion
or
by
example
but
it
is
absolutely
requisite
to
punish
them
by
disenfranchisement
by
exile
and
by
death
and
this
often
happens
in
so
great
an
empire
and
in
so
large
a
multitude
of
men
especially
during
a
change
of
government
now
if
you
appointed
other
men
to
judge
these
wrongdoers
they
would
acquit
them
speedily
particularly
all
whom
you
may
be
thought
to
hate
for
judges
secure
a
pretended
authority
when
they
act
in
any
way
contrary
to
the
wish
of
the
ruling
power
if
again
any
are
convicted
they
will
believe
they
have
been
condemned
on
account
of
instructions
for
which
you
are
responsible
however
if
you
sit
as
judge
yourself
you
will
be
compelled
to
chastise
many
of
the
peers
and
this
is
not
favorable
and
you
will
certainly
be
thought
to
be
setting
some
of
them
right
in
anger
rather
than
in
justice
no
one
believes
that
those
who
have
the
power
to
use
compulsion
can
execute
judgment
with
justice
but
everybody
thinks
that
out
of
shame
they
spread
out
a
mere
phantom
and
rough
picture
of
government
in
front
of
the
truth
in
order
that
under
the
legitimate
name
of
court
they
may
fulfill
their
desire
this
is
what
happens
in
monarchies
in
democracies
when
any
one
is
accused
of
committing
a
private
wrong
he
is
made
defendant
in
a
private
suit
before
judges
who
are
his
equals
or
if
he
is
accused
for
a
public
crime
such
a
man
has
empaneled
a
jury
of
his
peers
whoever
the
lot
shall
designate
it
is
easier
for
men
to
bear
their
decisions
since
they
do
not
think
that
any
verdict
rendered
is
due
to
the
power
of
the
judge
or
has
been
wrung
from
him
as
a
favor
then
again
there
are
many
apart
from
any
criminals
some
priding
themselves
on
birth
others
on
wealth
others
on
something
different
in
general
not
bad
men
who
are
by
nature
opposed
to
the
conception
of
monarchy
if
a
ruler
allows
them
to
become
strong
he
can
not
live
in
safety
and
if
he
undertakes
to
impose
a
check
on
them
he
can
not
do
so
justly
what
then
shall
he
do
with
them
how
shall
he
treat
them
if
you
root
out
their
families
diminish
their
wealth
humble
their
pride
you
will
lose
the
of
your
subjects
how
can
it
be
otherwise
if
no
one
is
permitted
to
be
born
nobly
or
to
grow
rich
honestly
or
to
become
strong
brave
or
learned
but
if
you
allow
all
the
separate
classes
to
grow
strong
you
will
not
be
able
to
deal
with
them
easily
if
you
alone
were
sufficient
for
carrying
on
politics
and
war
well
and
opportunely
and
needed
no
assistant
for
any
of
them
it
would
be
a
different
story
as
the
case
stands
however
it
is
quite
essential
for
you
to
have
many
helpers
since
they
must
govern
so
large
a
world
and
they
all
ought
to
be
both
brave
and
prudent
now
if
you
hand
over
the
legions
and
the
offices
to
such
men
there
will
be
danger
that
both
you
and
your
government
will
be
overthrown
it
is
not
possible
for
a
valuable
man
to
be
produced
without
good
sense
and
he
can
not
acquire
any
great
good
sense
from
servile
practices
but
again
if
he
becomes
a
man
of
sense
he
can
not
fail
to
desire
liberty
and
to
hate
all
masters
if
on
the
other
hand
you
entrust
nothing
to
these
men
but
put
affairs
in
charge
of
the
worthless
and
chance
comers
you
will
very
quickly
incur
the
anger
of
the
first
class
who
think
themselves
distrusted
and
you
will
very
quickly
fail
in
the
greatest
enterprises
what
good
could
an
ignorant
or
person
accomplish
what
enemy
would
not
hold
him
in
contempt
what
allies
would
obey
him
who
even
of
the
soldiers
themselves
would
not
disdain
to
be
ruled
by
such
a
man
what
evils
are
wont
to
result
from
such
a
condition
i
do
not
need
to
describe
to
you
for
you
know
them
thoroughly
i
feel
obliged
to
say
only
this
that
if
such
an
assistant
did
nothing
right
he
would
injure
you
far
more
than
the
enemy
if
he
did
anything
satisfactorily
his
lack
of
education
would
cause
him
to
lose
his
head
and
he
would
be
a
terror
to
you
such
a
question
does
not
arise
in
democracies
the
more
men
there
are
who
are
wealthy
and
brave
so
much
the
more
do
they
vie
with
one
another
and
the
city
the
latter
uses
them
and
is
glad
unless
any
one
of
them
wishes
to
found
a
tyranny
him
the
citizens
punish
severely
that
this
is
so
and
that
democracies
are
far
superior
to
monarchies
the
experience
of
greece
makes
clear
as
long
as
the
people
had
the
monarchical
government
they
effected
nothing
of
importance
but
when
they
began
to
live
under
the
democratic
system
they
became
most
renowned
it
is
shown
also
by
the
experience
of
other
branches
of
mankind
those
who
are
still
conducting
their
governments
under
tyrannies
are
always
in
slavery
and
always
plotting
against
their
rulers
but
those
who
have
presidents
for
a
year
or
some
longer
period
continue
to
be
both
free
and
independent
yet
why
need
we
use
foreign
examples
when
we
have
some
of
our
own
we
romans
ourselves
after
trying
a
different
social
organization
at
first
later
when
we
had
gone
through
many
bitter
experiences
felt
a
desire
for
liberty
and
having
secured
it
we
attained
our
present
eminence
strong
in
no
advantages
save
those
that
come
from
democracy
through
which
the
senate
debated
the
people
ratified
the
force
under
arms
showed
zeal
and
the
commanders
were
fired
with
ambition
none
of
these
things
could
be
done
under
a
tyranny
for
that
reason
indeed
the
ancient
romans
detested
it
so
much
as
to
impose
a
curse
upon
that
form
of
government
aside
from
these
considerations
if
one
is
to
speak
about
what
is
disadvantageous
for
you
personally
how
could
you
endure
the
management
of
so
many
interests
by
day
and
night
alike
how
could
you
hold
out
in
your
enfeebled
state
how
could
you
participate
in
human
enjoyments
how
could
you
be
happy
if
deprived
of
them
what
could
cause
you
real
pleasure
when
would
you
be
free
from
biting
grief
it
is
quite
inevitable
that
the
man
who
holds
so
great
an
empire
should
reflect
deeply
be
subject
to
many
fears
enjoy
very
little
pleasure
but
hear
and
see
perform
and
suffer
always
and
everywhere
what
is
most
disagreeable
that
is
why
i
think
both
greeks
and
some
barbarians
would
not
accept
government
by
a
king
when
offered
to
them
knowing
this
beforehand
take
good
counsel
before
you
enter
upon
such
an
existence
for
it
is
disgraceful
or
rather
impossible
after
you
have
once
plunged
into
it
to
rise
to
the
upper
air
again
do
not
be
deceived
by
the
greatness
of
the
authority
nor
the
abundance
of
possessions
nor
the
mass
of
nor
the
throng
of
courtiers
men
who
have
great
power
have
great
troubles
those
who
have
large
possessions
are
obliged
to
spend
largely
the
crowd
of
is
gathered
because
of
the
crowd
of
conspirators
and
the
flatterers
would
be
more
glad
to
destroy
than
to
save
any
one
consequently
in
view
of
these
facts
no
sensible
man
would
desire
to
become
supreme
ruler
if
the
fact
that
such
rulers
can
enrich
and
preserve
others
and
perform
many
other
good
deeds
and
that
by
jupiter
they
may
also
outrage
others
and
injure
whomsoever
they
please
leads
any
one
to
think
that
tyranny
is
worth
striving
for
he
is
utterly
mistaken
i
need
not
tell
you
that
to
live
licentiously
and
to
do
evil
is
base
and
hazardous
and
hated
of
both
gods
and
men
you
are
not
that
sort
of
man
and
it
is
not
for
these
reasons
that
you
would
choose
to
be
sole
ruler
i
have
elected
to
speak
now
not
of
everything
which
one
might
accomplish
who
handled
affairs
badly
but
of
what
even
the
very
best
are
compelled
to
do
and
endure
when
they
adopt
the
system
the
other
point
that
one
may
bestow
abundant
favors
is
worthy
of
zeal
to
be
sure
yet
when
this
disposition
is
indulged
in
private
capacity
it
is
noble
august
glorious
and
safe
whereas
in
monarchies
it
is
first
of
all
not
a
sufficient
offset
to
the
other
more
disagreeable
matters
that
any
one
should
choose
monarchy
for
this
especially
when
one
is
to
grant
to
others
the
benefit
to
be
derived
therefrom
and
accept
himself
the
unpleasantness
involved
in
the
rest
of
the
conduct
of
the
office
in
the
next
place
the
matter
is
not
simple
as
people
think
no
one
could
render
assistance
enough
to
satisfy
all
who
need
help
those
who
think
they
ought
to
receive
some
gift
from
the
sovereign
are
practically
all
mankind
even
though
no
favors
can
at
once
be
seen
to
be
due
them
every
one
naturally
has
his
own
approbation
and
wishes
to
enjoy
some
benefit
from
him
who
is
able
to
give
but
the
presents
which
can
be
given
them
i
mean
honors
and
offices
and
sometimes
money
can
be
counted
quite
easily
as
compared
with
so
great
a
multitude
this
being
so
more
hatred
would
fall
to
the
monarch
lot
from
those
who
fail
to
get
what
they
want
than
friendship
from
such
as
obtain
their
desires
the
latter
take
what
they
regard
as
due
to
them
and
think
there
is
no
particular
reason
for
being
very
thankful
to
the
one
who
gives
it
since
they
are
getting
no
more
than
they
expected
moreover
they
actually
shrink
from
such
behavior
for
fear
they
may
appear
in
the
light
of
persons
undeserving
of
generous
treatment
the
others
who
are
disappointed
of
their
hopes
are
grieved
for
two
causes
first
they
feel
that
they
are
robbed
of
what
belongs
to
them
for
by
nature
all
persons
think
that
everything
which
they
desire
is
their
own
second
they
feel
as
if
they
were
finding
themselves
guilty
of
some
wrong
if
they
show
resignation
at
not
obtaining
what
they
expect
the
man
who
gives
such
great
gifts
rightly
of
course
investigates
before
all
else
each
worth
some
he
honors
others
he
neglects
as
a
result
then
of
his
judgment
some
are
filled
with
pride
and
others
with
vexation
by
their
own
consciousness
of
its
correctness
if
any
one
were
to
wish
to
guard
against
this
outcome
and
distribute
his
presents
without
system
he
would
fail
utterly
the
base
being
honored
contrary
to
their
deserts
would
become
worse
for
they
would
decide
either
that
they
were
approved
as
being
good
or
if
not
so
that
they
were
courted
as
dangerous
persons
the
excellent
on
attaining
no
higher
place
than
they
but
held
merely
in
equal
honor
with
the
base
would
be
more
indignant
at
their
reduction
to
the
latter
level
than
the
others
would
rejoice
to
be
deemed
valuable
accordingly
they
would
give
up
the
practice
of
better
principles
and
strive
to
emulate
less
worthy
men
thus
even
as
a
result
of
the
very
honors
those
who
bestow
them
would
reap
no
benefit
and
those
who
receive
them
would
become
worse
than
before
so
that
this
consideration
which
would
please
some
persons
most
in
the
monarchical
constitution
has
been
proved
to
be
a
most
difficult
problem
for
you
to
deal
with
reflecting
on
these
facts
and
the
rest
which
i
mentioned
a
little
earlier
be
prudent
while
you
may
and
restore
to
the
people
the
arms
the
provinces
the
offices
and
the
funds
if
you
do
it
at
once
and
voluntarily
you
will
be
the
most
famous
of
men
and
the
most
secure
but
if
you
wait
for
some
force
to
be
applied
perhaps
you
might
suffer
some
disaster
together
with
ill
repute
here
is
evidence
marius
sulla
metellus
and
pompey
at
first
when
they
got
control
of
affairs
refused
to
become
princes
and
by
this
attitude
escaped
harm
cinna
however
and
strabo
the
second
marius
sertorius
and
pompey
himself
at
a
later
date
through
their
desire
for
sovereignty
perished
miserably
it
is
hard
for
this
city
which
has
been
under
a
democracy
for
so
many
years
and
rules
so
many
human
beings
to
be
willing
to
be
a
slave
to
any
one
you
have
heard
that
the
people
banished
camillus
when
he
used
white
horses
for
his
triumph
you
have
heard
that
they
overthrew
scipio
after
condemning
him
for
some
fraudulent
procedure
you
remember
how
they
behaved
toward
your
father
because
they
had
some
suspicion
that
he
wanted
monarchy
yet
there
have
never
been
any
better
men
than
these
moreover
i
do
not
advise
you
merely
to
relinquish
dominion
but
to
accomplish
beforehand
all
that
is
advantageous
for
the
public
and
by
decrees
and
laws
to
settle
definitely
whatever
business
needs
attention
just
as
sulla
did
for
even
if
some
of
his
ordinances
were
subsequently
overthrown
yet
the
majority
of
them
and
the
more
important
still
hold
their
ground
do
not
say
that
even
then
some
will
indulge
in
factional
quarrels
or
i
may
be
tempted
to
say
again
that
all
the
more
the
romans
would
not
submit
to
a
single
ruler
if
we
were
to
review
all
the
calamities
that
might
befall
a
nation
it
would
be
most
unreasonable
for
us
to
fear
dissensions
which
are
the
outgrowth
of
democracy
rather
then
the
tyrannies
which
spring
from
monarchy
regarding
the
terrible
nature
of
the
latter
i
have
not
even
undertaken
to
say
a
word
it
has
been
my
wish
not
merely
to
inveigh
against
a
proposition
so
capable
of
censure
but
to
show
you
this
that
it
is
naturally
such
a
régime
that
not
even
the
most
excellent
men
they
can
not
easily
persuade
by
frank
argument
men
who
possess
less
power
or
succeed
in
their
enterprises
because
their
subjects
are
not
in
accord
with
them
hence
if
you
have
any
care
at
all
of
your
country
for
whom
you
have
fought
so
many
wars
for
whom
you
would
gladly
surrender
your
life
attune
her
to
greater
moderation
and
order
her
affairs
with
that
in
view
for
the
privilege
of
doing
and
saving
precisely
what
one
pleases
becomes
in
the
case
of
sensible
people
if
you
examine
it
a
cause
of
prosperity
to
all
but
in
the
case
of
the
foolish
a
cause
of
disaster
therefore
he
who
confers
authority
upon
such
men
is
holding
out
a
sword
to
a
child
and
a
madman
but
he
who
gives
it
to
the
prudent
besides
performing
other
services
preserves
the
objects
of
his
liberality
themselves
though
they
may
be
unwilling
therefore
i
ask
you
not
to
be
deceived
by
regarding
names
but
to
look
forward
to
the
results
that
spring
from
them
and
so
to
put
an
end
to
the
insolence
of
the
populace
and
to
impose
the
management
of
public
affairs
upon
yourself
and
the
most
excellent
of
the
remainder
of
the
community
then
the
most
prudent
may
deliberate
those
most
qualified
for
generals
become
commanders
and
the
strongest
and
most
needy
men
serve
as
soldiers
and
draw
pay
in
this
way
all
zealously
discharging
the
duties
appertaining
to
their
offices
and
paying
without
hesitation
the
debts
they
owe
one
another
they
will
not
be
aware
of
their
inferiority
and
lack
of
certain
advantages
and
will
secure
the
real
democracy
and
a
safe
sort
of
freedom
the
boasted
freedom
of
the
mob
proves
to
be
the
most
bitter
servitude
of
the
best
element
and
brings
a
common
destruction
upon
both
the
other
which
i
advocate
honors
responsible
men
everywhere
and
bestows
equal
advantages
upon
all
so
far
as
they
are
worthy
thus
it
renders
prosperous
all
alike
who
possess
it
do
not
think
that
i
am
advising
you
to
enslave
the
people
and
the
senate
and
then
play
the
tyrant
this
plan
i
should
never
dare
to
suggest
nor
you
to
execute
it
would
notwithstanding
be
well
and
useful
both
for
you
and
for
the
city
that
you
should
yourself
establish
all
proper
laws
with
the
approval
of
the
best
men
without
any
opposing
talk
or
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
masses
that
you
and
your
counselors
should
arrange
the
details
of
wars
according
to
your
united
wishes
while
all
the
rest
straightway
obey
orders
that
the
choice
of
officials
should
be
in
the
power
of
the
cabinet
to
which
you
belong
and
that
the
same
men
should
also
determine
honors
and
penalties
then
whatever
pleases
you
after
consulting
the
peers
will
be
immediately
a
law
and
wars
against
enemies
may
be
waged
with
secrecy
and
at
an
opportune
time
those
to
whom
a
trust
is
committed
will
be
appointed
because
of
excellence
and
not
by
lot
and
strife
for
office
the
good
will
be
honored
without
jealousy
and
the
bad
punished
without
opposition
thus
what
was
done
would
be
accomplished
in
the
best
way
not
referred
to
the
public
nor
talked
over
openly
not
committed
to
packed
committees
nor
endangered
by
rivalry
we
should
reap
the
benefits
of
the
blessings
that
belong
to
us
with
enjoyment
not
entering
upon
dangerous
wars
nor
impious
civil
disputes
these
two
drawbacks
are
found
in
every
democracy
the
more
powerful
desiring
first
place
and
hiring
the
weaker
men
turn
everything
continually
upside
down
they
have
been
most
frequent
in
our
epoch
and
there
is
no
other
way
save
the
one
i
propose
that
will
put
a
stop
to
them
the
proof
of
my
words
is
that
we
have
been
warring
abroad
and
fighting
among
ourselves
for
an
inconceivably
long
time
the
cause
is
the
multitude
of
men
and
the
magnitude
of
the
interests
at
stake
the
men
are
of
all
sorts
in
respect
to
both
race
and
nature
and
have
the
most
diversified
tempers
and
desires
the
interests
have
become
so
vast
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
attempt
to
administer
them
witness
to
the
truth
of
my
words
is
borne
by
our
past
while
we
were
but
few
we
had
no
important
quarrel
with
our
neighbors
got
along
well
with
our
government
and
subjugated
almost
all
of
italy
but
ever
since
we
spread
beyond
the
peninsula
and
crossed
to
many
foreign
lands
and
islands
filling
the
whole
sea
and
the
whole
earth
with
our
name
and
power
nothing
good
has
been
our
lot
in
the
first
place
we
disputed
in
cliques
at
home
and
within
our
walls
and
later
we
exported
this
plague
to
the
camps
therefore
our
city
like
a
great
merchantman
full
of
a
crowd
of
every
race
borne
without
a
pilot
these
many
years
through
rough
water
rolls
and
shoots
hither
and
thither
because
it
is
without
ballast
do
not
then
allow
her
to
be
longer
exposed
to
the
tempest
for
you
see
that
she
is
waterlogged
and
do
not
let
her
split
upon
a
reef
for
her
timbers
are
rotten
and
will
not
be
able
to
hold
out
much
longer
but
since
the
gods
have
taken
pity
on
this
land
and
have
set
you
up
as
her
arbiter
and
chief
do
not
betray
your
country
through
you
she
has
now
revived
a
little
if
you
are
faithful
she
may
live
with
safety
for
ages
to
come
that
i
do
right
to
urge
you
to
be
sole
ruler
of
the
people
i
think
you
have
long
ere
this
been
persuaded
if
so
then
be
ready
and
eager
to
assume
the
leadership
of
the
state
or
rather
do
not
let
it
slip
for
we
are
not
deliberating
about
taking
something
but
about
not
losing
it
and
about
running
hazards
in
addition
who
will
spare
you
if
you
commit
matters
to
the
people
as
they
were
and
to
some
other
man
seeing
that
there
are
great
numbers
whom
you
have
injured
all
of
whom
or
nearly
all
will
lay
claim
to
the
sovereignty
no
one
of
them
will
fail
to
wish
to
punish
you
for
what
you
have
done
or
will
care
to
have
you
survive
as
a
rival
there
is
evidence
of
this
in
the
case
of
pompey
who
when
he
withdrew
from
his
supremacy
became
the
victim
of
scorn
and
of
plots
he
found
himself
unable
to
win
back
his
place
and
so
perished
also
cæsar
your
father
who
did
this
very
same
thing
was
slain
for
his
trouble
marius
and
sulla
would
certainly
have
endured
a
like
fate
had
they
not
died
too
soon
indeed
some
say
that
sulla
anticipated
this
very
end
by
making
away
with
himself
many
of
the
provisions
of
his
constitution
at
any
rate
began
to
be
abolished
while
he
was
still
alive
you
too
must
expect
to
find
that
many
lepiduses
sertoriuses
brutuses
cassiuses
will
arise
against
you
seeing
these
facts
and
reflecting
on
the
other
interests
involved
do
not
abandon
yourself
and
your
country
out
of
fear
that
you
may
seem
to
some
to
be
pursuing
the
office
of
set
purpose
first
of
all
even
if
any
one
does
suspect
it
the
desire
is
not
one
repugnant
to
human
nature
and
the
danger
from
it
is
a
noble
danger
second
is
any
one
unaware
of
the
necessity
under
which
you
were
led
to
take
this
action
hence
if
there
be
any
blame
attached
to
it
one
might
most
justly
censure
your
father
slayers
therefor
for
if
they
had
not
murdered
him
in
so
unjust
and
pitiable
a
fashion
you
would
not
have
taken
up
arms
would
not
have
gathered
your
legions
would
not
have
made
a
compact
with
antony
and
lepidus
and
would
not
have
taken
measures
against
those
very
men
that
you
were
right
and
were
justified
in
doing
all
this
no
one
is
unaware
if
any
slight
errors
have
been
committed
at
least
we
can
not
safely
make
any
further
changes
therefore
for
our
own
sakes
and
for
that
of
the
city
let
us
obey
fortune
who
gives
you
the
supremacy
let
us
be
very
thankful
to
her
that
she
has
not
simply
filled
us
with
civil
woes
but
has
put
the
reorganization
of
the
government
in
your
hands
by
paying
due
reverence
to
her
you
may
show
all
mankind
that
whereas
others
wrought
disturbance
and
injury
you
are
an
upright
man
do
not
i
beg
you
fear
the
magnitude
of
the
empire
the
greater
its
extent
the
more
are
the
preservative
influences
it
possesses
also
to
guard
anything
is
a
long
way
easier
than
to
acquire
it
toils
and
dangers
are
needed
to
win
over
what
belongs
to
others
but
a
little
prudence
suffices
to
retain
what
is
already
yours
moreover
do
not
be
afraid
that
you
will
not
live
quite
safely
in
the
midst
of
it
and
enjoy
all
the
blessings
extant
among
men
if
you
are
willing
to
arrange
all
the
details
as
i
shall
advise
you
and
do
not
think
that
i
am
making
my
appeal
depart
from
the
subject
in
hand
if
i
shall
speak
at
some
length
about
the
project
i
shall
not
do
this
merely
to
hear
myself
talk
but
to
the
end
that
you
may
be
positively
assured
that
it
is
both
possible
and
easy
for
a
man
of
sense
at
least
to
govern
well
and
without
danger
i
maintain
therefore
first
of
all
that
you
ought
to
pick
out
your
friends
in
the
senatorial
body
and
then
subject
it
to
a
sifting
process
because
some
who
are
not
fit
have
become
senators
on
account
of
civil
disputes
such
of
them
as
possess
any
excellence
you
ought
to
retain
but
the
rest
you
should
erase
from
the
roll
do
not
however
get
rid
of
any
man
of
worth
because
of
poverty
but
give
him
the
money
that
he
needs
in
the
place
of
those
who
have
been
dropped
introduce
the
noblest
the
best
the
richest
men
obtainable
selecting
them
not
only
from
italy
but
from
the
allies
and
subject
nations
in
this
way
you
will
not
be
employing
many
assistants
and
you
will
insure
a
correct
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
chief
men
from
all
the
provinces
these
districts
having
no
renowned
leader
will
not
be
disposed
to
rebel
and
their
prominent
men
will
entertain
affection
for
you
because
they
have
been
made
sharers
in
your
empire
take
precisely
these
same
measures
in
the
case
of
the
knights
by
enrolling
in
the
equestrian
class
such
as
hold
second
place
everywhere
in
birth
excellence
and
wealth
register
as
many
in
both
classes
as
may
please
you
not
troubling
at
all
about
their
numbers
the
more
men
of
repute
you
have
as
your
associates
the
more
easily
will
you
yourself
settle
everything
in
case
of
need
and
persuade
your
subjects
that
you
are
treating
them
not
as
slaves
nor
in
any
way
as
inferior
to
us
but
are
sharing
with
them
besides
all
the
other
blessings
that
belong
to
us
the
chief
magistracy
also
that
so
they
may
be
devoted
to
it
as
their
own
possession
i
am
so
far
from
assuming
this
to
be
a
mistaken
policy
that
i
say
they
ought
all
to
be
given
a
share
in
the
government
thus
having
an
equal
allotment
in
it
they
might
be
faithful
allies
of
ours
believing
that
they
inhabited
one
single
city
owned
in
common
by
all
of
us
and
this
a
city
and
regarding
fields
and
villages
as
their
individual
property
but
about
this
and
what
ought
to
be
done
so
as
not
to
grant
them
absolutely
everything
we
shall
reflect
in
greater
detail
at
another
time
it
is
proper
to
put
men
on
the
roll
of
the
knights
at
eighteen
years
of
age
for
at
that
period
of
life
physical
condition
is
at
its
best
and
suitability
of
temperament
can
be
discerned
but
for
the
senate
they
should
wait
till
they
are
years
old
is
it
not
disgraceful
and
hazardous
to
entrust
public
business
to
men
younger
than
this
when
we
will
commit
none
of
our
private
affairs
to
any
one
before
he
has
reached
such
an
age
after
they
have
served
as
quæstors
and
ædiles
or
tribunes
let
them
be
prætors
when
they
have
attained
their
thirtieth
birthday
these
offices
and
that
of
consul
are
the
only
ones
at
home
which
i
maintain
you
ought
to
recognize
and
that
is
for
the
sake
of
remembrance
of
ancestral
customs
and
in
order
not
to
seem
to
be
changing
the
constitution
altogether
do
you
however
yourself
choose
all
who
are
to
hold
them
and
not
put
any
of
these
offices
longer
in
charge
of
the
rabble
or
the
populace
for
they
will
surely
quarrel
nor
in
charge
of
the
senate
for
its
members
will
contend
for
the
prize
moreover
do
not
keep
up
the
ancient
powers
of
these
positions
for
fear
history
may
repeat
itself
but
preserve
the
honor
attached
while
abating
the
influence
to
such
an
extent
as
will
enable
you
to
deprive
each
place
of
none
of
its
esteem
but
to
forestall
any
desire
of
insubordination
this
can
be
done
if
you
require
the
incumbents
to
stay
in
town
and
do
not
permit
any
of
them
to
handle
arms
either
during
their
period
of
office
or
immediately
afterward
but
only
after
the
lapse
of
some
time
as
much
as
you
think
sufficient
in
each
instance
in
this
way
none
of
them
will
rebel
because
they
become
to
an
extent
by
their
title
masters
of
armies
and
their
irritation
will
be
assuaged
by
their
faring
as
private
citizens
for
a
time
let
these
magistrates
conduct
such
of
the
festivals
as
would
naturally
belong
to
their
office
and
let
them
all
individually
try
cases
save
those
of
homicide
during
their
tenure
of
office
in
rome
courts
should
also
be
made
up
of
the
senators
and
knights
but
the
final
appeal
should
be
to
the
aforesaid
officials
let
a
præfectus
urbi
be
appointed
from
the
ranks
of
the
prominent
men
and
from
such
as
have
previously
passed
through
the
necessary
offices
his
duties
should
not
be
to
govern
when
the
consuls
are
somewhere
out
of
town
but
to
exercise
at
all
times
a
general
supervision
of
the
city
interests
and
to
decide
the
cases
referred
to
him
by
all
the
other
magistrates
i
mentioned
both
those
demanding
final
decision
and
such
as
may
be
appealed
together
with
any
that
involve
the
death
penalty
and
he
must
have
authority
in
all
of
them
that
concern
men
both
in
the
city
except
such
as
i
shall
name
and
those
dwelling
outside
to
the
distance
of
seven
hundred
and
fifty
stades
still
another
magistrate
ought
to
be
chosen
himself
also
from
a
similar
class
to
investigate
and
watch
the
matters
of
family
property
and
morals
of
senators
and
knights
alike
of
men
and
of
the
children
and
wives
belonging
to
them
he
should
also
set
right
such
behavior
as
properly
entails
no
punishment
yet
if
neglected
becomes
the
cause
of
many
great
evils
the
more
important
details
he
must
report
to
you
this
duty
ought
to
be
assigned
to
some
senator
and
to
the
most
distinguished
one
after
the
præfectus
urbi
rather
than
to
one
of
the
knights
he
would
naturally
receive
his
name
from
your
authority
as
censor
for
you
must
certainly
be
the
dictator
of
the
census
so
that
he
might
be
called
let
these
two
hold
office
for
life
unless
either
of
them
deteriorates
in
any
way
or
becomes
sick
or
superannuated
by
reason
of
the
permanence
of
their
positions
they
would
do
nothing
dangerous
for
one
would
be
entirely
unarmed
and
the
other
would
have
but
a
few
soldiers
and
be
acting
for
the
most
part
under
your
eyes
by
reason
of
their
rank
they
would
shrink
from
coming
into
collision
with
any
one
and
would
be
afraid
to
do
any
act
of
violence
for
they
would
foresee
their
retirement
to
ordinary
citizenship
and
the
supremacy
of
others
in
their
stead
let
them
also
draw
a
certain
salary
to
compensate
them
for
the
time
consumed
and
to
increase
their
reputation
this
is
the
opinion
i
have
to
give
you
in
regard
to
these
officials
let
those
who
have
been
prætors
hold
some
office
among
the
subject
nations
before
they
have
been
prætors
i
do
not
think
they
should
have
this
privilege
let
those
who
have
not
yet
been
prætors
serve
for
one
or
two
terms
as
lieutenants
to
such
persons
as
you
may
have
designated
then
under
these
conditions
let
them
be
consuls
if
they
continue
to
govern
rightly
and
after
that
let
them
take
the
greater
positions
of
command
the
following
is
the
way
i
advise
you
to
arrange
it
divide
up
all
of
italy
which
is
over
seven
hundred
and
fifty
stades
from
the
city
and
all
the
rest
of
the
territory
which
owns
our
sway
both
on
the
continents
and
in
the
islands
divide
it
up
everywhere
according
to
races
and
nations
and
pursue
the
same
course
with
as
many
cities
as
are
important
enough
to
be
ruled
by
one
man
with
full
powers
then
establish
soldiers
and
a
governor
in
each
one
and
send
out
one
of
the
to
take
charge
of
all
and
two
of
the
one
of
the
latter
fresh
from
the
city
should
have
the
care
of
private
business
and
the
supplying
of
provisions
the
other
should
be
one
of
those
who
have
had
this
training
who
will
attend
to
the
public
interests
of
the
cities
and
will
govern
the
soldiers
except
in
cases
that
concern
disenfranchisement
or
death
these
must
be
referred
only
to
the
who
is
governor
except
in
regard
to
the
centurions
who
are
on
the
lists
and
to
the
foremost
private
individuals
in
every
place
do
not
allow
any
other
person
than
yourself
to
punish
either
of
these
classes
so
that
they
may
never
be
impelled
by
fear
of
any
one
else
to
take
any
action
against
you
as
for
my
proposition
that
the
second
of
the
should
be
put
in
charge
of
the
soldiers
it
is
subject
to
the
following
limitations
if
only
a
few
are
in
service
in
foreign
forts
or
in
one
native
post
it
is
well
enough
for
this
to
be
so
but
if
two
citizen
legions
are
wintering
in
the
same
province
and
more
than
this
number
i
should
not
advise
you
to
trust
to
one
commander
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
two
to
superintend
them
each
having
charge
of
one
besides
managing
the
remaining
political
and
private
interests
therefore
let
the
these
matters
and
likewise
on
the
cases
both
those
subject
to
appeal
and
those
already
referred
which
are
sent
up
to
him
from
his
prætors
and
do
not
be
surprised
that
i
recommend
to
you
to
divide
italy
also
into
such
sections
it
is
large
and
populous
and
so
is
incapable
of
being
well
managed
by
the
governors
at
the
capital
the
governor
of
any
district
ought
to
be
always
present
and
no
duties
should
be
laid
upon
our
city
magistrates
that
are
impossible
of
fulfillment
let
all
these
men
to
whom
affairs
outside
the
city
are
committed
receive
pay
the
greater
ones
more
the
inferior
ones
less
those
of
medium
importance
a
medium
amount
they
can
not
in
a
foreign
land
live
on
their
own
resources
nor
as
now
stand
an
unlimited
and
uncalculated
expense
let
them
govern
not
less
than
three
years
unless
any
one
of
them
commits
a
crime
nor
more
than
five
these
limits
are
because
annual
and
appointments
after
teaching
persons
what
they
need
to
know
send
them
back
again
before
they
can
display
any
of
their
knowledge
and
on
the
other
hand
longer
and
more
lasting
positions
fill
many
with
conceit
and
incline
them
to
rebellion
hence
i
think
that
the
greater
posts
of
authority
ought
not
to
be
given
to
persons
consecutively
without
interval
for
it
makes
no
difference
whether
a
man
is
governor
in
the
same
province
or
in
several
in
succession
if
he
holds
office
longer
than
is
proper
appointees
improve
when
a
period
of
time
is
allowed
to
elapse
and
they
return
home
and
live
as
ordinary
citizens
the
senators
accordingly
i
affirm
ought
to
discharge
these
duties
and
in
the
way
described
of
the
knights
the
two
best
should
command
the
which
protects
you
to
entrust
it
to
one
man
is
hazardous
and
to
several
is
sure
to
breed
turmoil
let
these
prefects
therefore
be
two
in
number
in
order
that
if
one
of
them
suffers
any
bodily
harm
you
may
still
not
lack
a
person
to
guard
you
and
let
them
be
appointed
from
those
who
have
been
on
many
campaigns
and
have
been
active
also
in
many
other
capacities
let
them
have
command
both
of
the
pretorians
and
of
all
the
remaining
soldiers
in
italy
with
such
absolute
power
that
they
may
put
to
death
such
of
them
as
do
wrong
except
in
the
case
of
the
centurions
and
any
others
who
have
been
assigned
to
members
of
the
senate
holding
office
these
should
be
tried
by
the
senatorial
magistrates
themselves
in
order
that
the
latter
may
have
authority
both
to
honor
and
to
chastise
their
dependents
and
so
be
able
to
count
on
their
unhesitating
support
over
all
the
other
soldiers
in
italy
those
prefects
should
have
dominion
aided
of
course
by
lieutenants
and
further
over
the
cæsarians
both
such
as
wait
upon
you
and
all
the
rest
that
are
of
any
value
these
duties
will
be
both
fitting
and
sufficient
for
them
to
discharge
they
should
not
have
more
labors
laid
upon
them
than
they
will
be
able
to
dispose
of
effectively
that
they
may
not
be
weighed
down
by
the
press
of
work
or
find
it
impossible
to
see
to
everything
these
men
ought
to
hold
office
for
life
like
the
præfectus
urbi
and
the
let
some
one
else
be
appointed
night
watchman
and
still
another
commissioner
of
grain
and
of
the
other
market
produce
both
of
these
from
the
foremost
knights
after
those
mentioned
and
appointed
to
hold
their
posts
for
a
definite
time
like
the
magistrates
elected
from
the
senatorial
class
the
disposition
of
the
funds
also
of
both
the
people
and
the
empire
i
mean
whether
in
rome
or
in
the
rest
of
italy
or
outside
should
be
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
knights
these
treasurers
also
as
well
as
all
of
the
same
class
who
have
the
management
of
anything
should
draw
pay
some
more
and
some
less
with
reference
to
the
dignity
and
magnitude
of
their
employment
the
reason
is
that
it
is
not
possible
for
them
since
they
are
poorer
than
the
senators
to
spend
their
own
means
while
engaged
in
no
business
in
rome
and
then
again
it
is
neither
possible
nor
advantageous
for
you
that
the
same
men
should
be
made
masters
of
both
the
troops
and
the
finances
furthermore
it
is
well
that
all
the
business
of
the
empire
should
be
transacted
through
a
number
of
agents
in
order
that
many
may
receive
the
benefit
of
it
and
become
experienced
in
affairs
in
this
way
your
subjects
reaping
a
multiform
enjoyment
from
the
public
treasures
will
be
better
disposed
toward
you
and
you
will
have
an
abundant
supply
of
the
best
men
on
each
occasion
for
all
necessary
lines
of
work
one
single
knight
with
as
many
subordinates
drawn
from
the
knights
and
from
your
freedmen
as
the
needs
of
the
case
demand
is
sufficient
for
every
separate
form
of
business
in
the
city
and
for
each
province
outside
you
need
to
have
these
assistants
along
with
them
in
order
that
your
service
may
contain
a
prize
of
excellence
and
that
you
may
not
lack
persons
from
whom
you
may
learn
the
truth
even
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
their
superiors
in
case
there
is
anything
irregular
happening
if
any
one
of
the
knights
after
passing
through
many
forms
of
service
distinguishes
himself
enough
to
become
a
senator
his
age
ought
not
to
hinder
him
at
all
from
being
enrolled
in
the
senate
let
some
of
those
even
be
registered
who
have
held
the
post
of
company
leaders
in
citizen
forces
unless
it
be
one
who
has
served
in
the
rank
and
file
for
it
is
both
a
shame
and
a
reproach
to
have
on
the
list
of
the
senate
any
of
these
persons
who
have
carried
loaded
panniers
and
charcoal
baskets
but
in
the
case
of
such
as
were
originally
centurions
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
most
distinguished
of
them
from
being
advanced
to
a
better
class
with
regard
to
the
senators
and
the
knights
this
is
my
advice
to
you
and
by
jupiter
i
have
this
to
say
further
while
they
are
still
children
they
should
attend
schools
and
when
they
come
out
of
childhood
into
youth
they
should
turn
their
minds
to
horses
and
arms
and
have
paid
public
teachers
in
each
of
these
two
departments
in
this
way
from
very
boyhood
they
will
both
learn
and
practice
all
that
they
must
themselves
do
on
becoming
men
and
so
they
will
prove
far
more
serviceable
to
you
for
every
work
the
best
ruler
who
is
of
any
value
must
not
only
himself
perform
all
his
required
tasks
but
also
look
forward
to
see
how
the
rest
shall
become
also
as
excellent
as
possible
and
this
name
can
be
yours
not
if
you
allow
them
to
do
whatever
they
please
and
then
censure
those
who
err
but
if
before
any
mistakes
occur
you
teach
them
everything
which
when
practiced
will
render
them
more
useful
both
to
themselves
and
to
you
and
afford
nobody
any
excuse
whatever
either
wealth
or
birth
or
anything
else
that
accompanies
excellence
for
affecting
indolence
or
effeminacy
or
any
other
behavior
that
is
not
genuine
many
persons
fearing
that
on
account
of
some
such
possession
they
may
incur
jealousy
or
danger
do
much
that
is
unworthy
of
themselves
expecting
by
such
behavior
to
live
in
greater
security
as
a
consequence
they
commiserate
themselves
believing
themselves
wronged
in
this
very
particular
that
they
are
not
allowed
to
appear
to
live
aright
their
ruler
also
suffers
a
loss
because
he
is
deprived
of
the
services
of
good
men
and
suffers
ill
repute
for
the
censure
imposed
upon
them
therefore
never
permit
this
to
be
done
and
have
no
fears
that
any
one
brought
up
and
educated
as
i
propose
will
ever
adopt
a
rebellious
policy
quite
the
reverse
it
is
only
the
ignorant
and
licentious
that
you
need
suspect
such
persons
are
easily
influenced
to
behave
most
disgracefully
and
abominably
in
absolutely
every
way
first
toward
their
own
selves
and
next
toward
other
people
those
however
who
have
been
well
brought
up
and
educated
are
purposed
not
to
wrong
any
one
and
least
of
all
him
who
cared
for
their
rearing
and
education
if
any
one
accordingly
shows
himself
wicked
and
ungrateful
do
not
entrust
him
with
any
such
position
as
will
enable
him
to
effect
any
harm
if
even
so
he
rebels
let
him
be
tried
and
punished
do
not
be
afraid
that
any
one
will
blame
you
for
this
if
you
carry
out
all
my
injunctions
for
in
taking
vengeance
on
the
wrongdoer
you
will
be
guilty
of
no
sin
any
more
than
the
physician
who
burns
and
cuts
all
will
pronounce
the
man
justly
treated
because
after
partaking
of
the
same
rearing
and
education
as
the
rest
he
plotted
against
this
is
the
course
of
action
i
advise
in
the
case
of
the
senators
and
knights
a
standing
army
should
be
supported
drawn
from
the
citizens
the
subject
nations
and
the
allies
in
one
case
more
in
another
less
province
by
province
as
the
necessities
of
the
case
demand
and
they
ought
to
be
always
under
arms
and
make
a
practice
of
warfare
continually
they
must
have
secured
at
the
most
opportune
points
and
serve
for
a
definite
time
so
that
a
certain
period
of
active
life
may
remain
for
them
before
old
age
for
separated
so
far
as
we
are
from
the
frontiers
of
the
empire
with
enemies
living
near
us
on
every
side
we
should
otherwise
no
longer
be
able
to
count
on
auxiliaries
in
the
case
of
emergencies
again
if
we
allow
all
those
of
military
age
to
have
arms
and
to
practice
warlike
pursuits
quarrels
and
civil
wars
will
always
be
arising
among
them
however
if
we
prevent
them
from
doing
this
and
then
need
their
assistance
at
all
in
battle
we
shall
always
have
to
face
danger
with
inexperienced
and
untrained
soldiers
at
our
back
for
this
reason
i
submit
the
proposition
that
most
of
them
live
without
arms
and
away
from
forts
but
that
the
hardiest
and
those
most
in
need
of
a
livelihood
be
registered
and
kept
in
practice
they
themselves
will
fight
better
by
devoting
their
leisure
to
this
single
business
and
the
rest
will
the
more
easily
farm
manage
ships
and
attend
to
the
other
pursuits
of
peace
if
they
are
not
forced
to
be
called
out
for
service
but
have
others
to
stand
as
their
guardians
the
most
active
and
vigorous
element
that
is
which
is
oftenest
obliged
to
live
by
robbery
will
be
supported
without
harming
others
and
all
the
rest
of
the
population
will
lead
a
life
free
from
danger
from
what
source
then
will
the
money
come
for
these
warriors
and
for
the
other
expenses
that
will
be
found
necessary
i
shall
make
this
point
clear
with
only
the
short
preliminary
statement
that
even
were
we
under
a
democracy
we
should
in
any
case
need
money
we
can
not
survive
without
soldiers
and
without
pay
none
of
them
will
serve
hence
let
us
not
feel
downhearted
in
the
belief
that
the
compulsory
collection
of
money
appertains
only
to
monarchy
and
let
us
not
turn
away
from
the
system
for
that
reason
but
conduct
our
deliberations
with
a
full
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
in
any
case
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
obtain
funds
whatsoever
form
of
government
we
may
adopt
consequently
i
maintain
that
you
should
first
of
all
sell
the
goods
which
are
in
the
public
treasury
and
i
notice
that
these
have
become
numerous
on
account
of
the
wars
except
a
few
which
are
exceedingly
useful
and
necessary
to
you
and
you
should
loan
all
this
money
at
some
moderate
rate
of
interest
in
this
way
the
land
will
be
worked
being
delivered
to
men
who
will
cultivate
it
themselves
and
the
latter
will
obtain
a
and
so
grow
more
prosperous
while
the
treasury
will
have
a
sufficient
and
perpetual
revenue
this
amount
should
be
computed
together
with
all
the
rest
of
the
revenue
that
can
be
derived
from
the
mines
and
with
certainty
from
any
other
source
and
after
that
we
ought
to
reckon
on
not
only
the
military
service
but
everything
else
which
contributes
to
the
successful
life
of
a
city
and
further
how
much
it
will
be
necessary
to
lay
out
in
campaigns
at
short
notice
and
other
critical
occurrences
which
are
wont
to
take
place
then
to
make
up
the
deficiency
in
income
we
ought
to
levy
upon
absolutely
all
instruments
which
produce
any
profit
for
the
men
who
possess
them
and
we
should
exact
taxes
from
all
whom
we
rule
it
is
both
just
and
proper
that
no
one
of
them
should
be
exempt
from
taxation
individual
or
people
because
they
are
destined
to
enjoy
the
benefit
of
the
taxes
in
common
with
the
rest
we
should
set
over
them
in
every
case
to
manage
the
business
so
that
they
may
levy
from
all
sources
of
revenue
everything
that
falls
due
during
their
term
of
management
the
following
plan
will
render
it
easier
for
the
officers
to
gather
the
taxes
and
will
be
of
no
little
service
to
those
who
contribute
them
i
mean
that
they
will
bring
in
whatever
they
owe
in
an
appointed
order
and
little
by
little
instead
of
remaining
idle
a
short
time
and
then
having
the
entire
sum
demanded
of
them
in
one
payment
i
am
not
unaware
that
some
of
the
incomes
and
taxes
established
will
be
disliked
but
i
know
this
too
that
if
the
peoples
secure
immunity
from
any
further
abuse
and
believe
in
reality
that
they
will
be
contributing
all
of
this
for
their
own
safety
and
for
reaping
subsidiary
benefits
in
abundance
and
that
most
of
it
will
be
obtained
by
no
others
than
men
of
their
own
district
some
by
governing
others
by
managing
others
by
army
service
they
will
be
very
grateful
to
you
giving
as
they
do
a
small
portion
of
large
possessions
the
profits
of
which
they
enjoy
without
oppression
especially
will
this
be
true
if
they
see
that
you
live
temperately
and
spend
nothing
foolishly
who
if
he
saw
you
very
economical
of
your
own
means
and
very
lavish
of
the
public
funds
would
not
willingly
contribute
and
deem
your
possession
of
wealth
to
constitute
his
safety
and
prosperity
by
these
means
a
very
large
amount
of
money
would
be
on
hand
the
rest
i
urge
you
to
arrange
in
the
following
way
adorn
this
city
in
the
most
expensive
manner
possible
and
add
brilliance
by
every
form
of
festival
it
is
fitting
that
we
who
rule
many
people
should
surpass
all
in
everything
and
such
spectacles
tend
in
a
way
to
promote
respect
on
the
part
of
our
allies
and
alarm
on
the
part
of
enemies
the
affairs
of
other
nations
you
should
order
in
this
fashion
first
let
the
various
tribes
have
no
power
in
any
matter
nor
meet
in
assemblies
at
all
they
would
decide
nothing
good
and
would
always
be
creating
more
or
less
turmoil
hence
i
say
that
even
our
own
populace
ought
not
to
gather
at
court
or
for
elections
or
for
any
other
such
meeting
where
any
business
is
to
be
transacted
next
they
should
not
indulge
in
numbers
of
houses
of
great
size
and
beyond
what
is
necessary
and
they
should
not
expend
money
upon
many
and
all
kinds
of
contests
so
they
will
neither
be
worn
out
by
vain
zeal
nor
become
hostile
through
unreasonable
rivalries
they
ought
however
to
have
certain
festivals
and
spectacles
apart
from
the
held
among
us
but
not
to
such
an
extent
that
the
treasury
or
private
estates
will
be
injured
or
any
stranger
be
compelled
to
spend
anything
whatever
in
their
midst
or
food
for
a
lifetime
be
furnished
to
all
who
have
merely
won
in
some
contest
it
is
unreasonable
that
the
should
submit
to
compulsory
expenditures
outside
their
own
countries
and
for
the
athletes
the
prizes
for
each
event
are
sufficient
this
ruling
does
not
apply
to
any
one
of
them
who
might
come
out
victor
in
the
olympian
or
pythian
games
or
some
contest
here
at
rome
such
are
the
only
persons
who
ought
to
be
fed
and
then
the
cities
will
not
exhaust
themselves
without
avail
nor
anybody
practice
save
those
who
have
a
chance
of
winning
since
one
can
follow
some
other
pursuit
that
is
more
advantageous
both
to
one
self
and
to
one
country
this
is
my
decision
about
these
now
to
the
which
are
held
without
gymnastic
contests
i
think
that
no
other
city
but
ours
should
be
allowed
to
hold
them
so
that
vast
sums
of
money
may
not
be
dissipated
recklessly
nor
men
go
miserably
frantic
and
most
of
all
that
the
soldiers
may
have
a
plentiful
supply
of
the
best
horses
this
therefore
i
would
forbid
altogether
that
those
races
should
take
place
anywhere
else
than
here
the
other
amusements
i
have
determined
to
moderate
so
that
all
organizations
should
make
the
enjoyment
of
entertainments
for
eye
and
ear
inexpensive
and
men
thereby
live
more
temperately
and
free
from
discontent
let
none
of
the
foreigners
employ
their
own
coinage
or
weights
or
measures
but
let
them
all
use
ours
and
they
should
send
no
embassy
to
you
unless
it
involve
a
point
for
decision
let
them
instead
present
to
their
governor
whatever
they
please
and
through
him
forward
to
you
all
such
requests
of
theirs
as
he
may
approve
in
this
way
they
will
neither
spend
anything
nor
effect
their
object
by
crooked
practices
but
receive
their
answers
at
first
hand
without
any
expenditure
or
intrigue
moreover
in
respect
to
other
matters
you
would
seem
to
be
ordering
things
in
the
best
way
if
you
should
in
the
first
place
introduce
before
the
senate
the
embassies
which
come
from
the
enemy
and
from
those
under
truce
both
kings
and
peoples
for
it
is
and
impressive
to
let
the
senate
appear
to
be
master
of
all
situations
and
to
exhibit
many
adversaries
prepared
for
petitioners
who
are
guilty
of
double
dealing
next
have
all
the
laws
enacted
by
the
senators
and
do
not
impose
a
single
one
upon
all
the
people
alike
except
the
decrees
of
that
body
in
this
way
the
dignity
of
the
empire
would
be
the
more
confirmed
and
the
decisions
made
in
accordance
with
the
laws
would
prove
indisputable
and
evident
to
all
alike
thirdly
it
would
be
well
in
case
the
senators
who
are
serving
in
the
city
their
children
or
their
wives
are
ever
charged
with
any
serious
crime
so
that
a
person
convicted
would
receive
a
penalty
of
disenfranchisement
or
exile
or
even
death
that
you
should
set
the
situation
before
the
senate
without
any
previous
condemnation
and
commit
to
that
body
the
entire
decision
at
first
hand
regarding
it
thus
those
guilty
of
any
crime
would
be
tried
before
all
their
peers
and
punished
without
any
against
you
the
rest
seeing
this
would
improve
in
character
for
fear
of
being
themselves
publicly
apprehended
i
am
speaking
here
about
those
offences
regarding
which
laws
are
established
and
judgments
are
rendered
according
to
the
laws
as
for
talk
that
some
one
has
abused
you
or
spoken
in
an
unfitting
way
about
you
do
not
listen
to
any
one
who
brings
such
an
accusation
nor
investigate
it
it
is
disgraceful
to
believe
that
any
one
has
wantonly
insulted
you
who
are
doing
no
wrong
and
benefiting
all
only
those
who
rule
badly
will
credit
these
reports
because
of
their
own
conscience
they
surmise
that
the
matter
has
been
stated
truthfully
it
is
a
shame
to
be
angry
at
complaints
for
which
if
true
one
had
better
not
have
been
responsible
and
about
which
if
false
one
ought
not
to
pretend
to
care
many
in
times
past
by
angry
behavior
have
caused
more
things
and
worse
to
be
said
against
them
this
is
my
opinion
about
those
accused
of
uttering
some
insult
your
personality
should
be
too
strong
and
too
lofty
to
be
assailed
by
any
insolence
and
you
should
never
allow
yourself
to
think
nor
lead
others
into
thinking
that
any
person
can
be
indecent
toward
you
thus
they
will
think
of
you
as
of
the
gods
that
you
are
sacrosanct
if
any
one
should
be
accused
of
plotting
against
you
such
a
thing
might
happen
do
not
yourself
sit
as
judge
on
a
single
detail
of
the
case
nor
reach
any
decision
in
advance
for
it
is
absurd
that
the
same
man
should
be
made
both
accuser
and
judge
but
take
him
to
the
senate
and
make
him
plead
his
defence
if
he
be
convicted
punish
him
though
moderating
the
sentence
so
far
as
is
feasible
in
order
that
belief
in
his
guilt
may
be
fostered
it
is
very
difficult
to
make
most
men
believe
that
any
unarmed
person
will
plot
against
him
who
is
armed
and
the
only
way
you
could
gain
credence
would
be
by
punishing
him
not
in
anger
nor
overwhelmingly
if
it
be
this
is
aside
from
the
case
of
one
who
had
an
army
and
should
revolt
directly
against
you
it
is
not
fitting
that
such
an
one
be
tried
but
that
he
be
chastised
as
an
enemy
in
this
way
refer
to
the
senate
these
matters
and
most
of
the
highly
important
affairs
that
concern
the
commonwealth
public
interests
you
must
administer
publicly
it
is
also
an
inbred
trait
of
human
nature
for
individuals
to
delight
in
marks
of
esteem
from
a
superior
which
seem
to
raise
one
to
equality
with
him
and
to
approve
everything
which
the
superior
has
determined
after
consulting
them
as
if
it
were
their
own
proposal
and
to
cherish
it
as
if
it
were
their
own
choice
consequently
i
affirm
that
such
business
ought
to
be
brought
before
the
in
regard
to
most
cases
all
those
senators
present
ought
equally
to
state
their
opinions
but
when
one
of
their
number
is
accused
not
all
of
them
should
do
so
unless
it
be
some
one
who
is
not
yet
a
senator
or
is
not
yet
in
the
ranks
of
the
that
is
being
tried
and
indeed
it
is
absurd
that
one
who
has
not
yet
been
a
tribune
or
an
ædile
should
cast
a
vote
against
such
as
have
already
filled
these
offices
or
by
jupiter
that
any
one
of
the
latter
should
vote
against
the
or
they
against
the
let
the
last
named
have
authority
to
render
a
decision
in
all
cases
but
the
rest
only
in
the
cases
of
their
peers
and
their
subordinates
you
yourself
must
try
in
person
the
referred
and
the
appealed
cases
which
come
to
you
from
the
higher
officials
from
the
procurators
from
the
præfectus
urbi
from
the
and
the
prefects
both
the
commissioner
of
grain
and
the
no
single
one
of
them
should
have
such
absolute
powers
of
decision
and
such
independence
that
a
case
can
not
be
appealed
from
him
you
should
be
the
judge
therefore
in
these
instances
and
also
when
knights
are
concerned
and
properly
enrolled
centurions
and
the
foremost
private
citizens
if
the
trial
involves
death
or
disenfranchisement
let
these
be
your
business
alone
and
for
the
reasons
mentioned
let
no
one
else
on
his
own
responsibility
render
a
decision
in
them
you
should
always
have
associated
with
you
for
discussion
the
most
honored
of
the
senators
and
of
the
knights
and
further
certain
others
from
the
ranks
of
the
and
some
at
one
time
and
some
at
another
in
this
association
you
will
become
more
accurately
acquainted
with
their
characters
beforehand
and
so
be
able
to
put
them
to
the
right
kind
of
employment
and
they
by
coming
in
contact
with
your
habits
and
wishes
will
have
them
in
mind
on
going
out
to
govern
the
provinces
do
not
however
openly
ask
their
opinions
when
a
rather
careful
consideration
is
required
for
fear
that
they
being
outside
their
accustomed
sphere
may
hesitate
to
speak
freely
but
let
them
record
their
views
on
tablets
to
these
you
alone
should
have
access
that
they
may
become
known
to
no
one
else
and
then
order
the
writing
to
be
immediately
erased
in
this
way
you
may
best
get
at
each
man
exact
opinion
when
they
believe
that
it
can
not
be
identified
among
all
the
rest
moreover
for
the
lawsuits
letters
and
decrees
of
the
cities
for
the
consideration
of
the
demands
of
individuals
and
everything
else
which
belongs
to
the
administration
of
the
empire
you
must
have
supporters
and
assistants
from
among
the
knights
everything
will
move
along
more
easily
in
this
way
and
you
will
neither
err
through
want
of
fairness
nor
become
exhausted
by
doing
everything
yourself
grant
every
one
who
wishes
to
make
any
suggestion
whatever
to
you
the
right
of
speaking
freely
and
fearlessly
if
you
approve
what
he
says
it
will
be
of
great
service
and
if
you
are
not
persuaded
it
will
do
no
harm
those
who
obtain
your
favorable
judgment
you
should
both
praise
and
honor
since
by
their
devices
you
will
receive
glory
and
those
who
fail
of
it
you
should
never
dishonor
or
censure
it
is
proper
to
look
at
their
intentions
and
not
to
find
fault
because
their
plans
were
unavailable
guard
against
this
same
mistake
when
war
is
concerned
be
not
enraged
at
any
one
for
involuntary
misfortune
nor
jealous
of
his
good
fortune
to
the
end
that
all
may
zealously
and
gladly
run
risks
for
you
confident
that
if
they
make
a
slip
they
will
not
be
punished
nor
if
successful
become
the
objects
of
intrigue
there
are
many
who
through
fear
of
jealousy
on
the
part
of
those
in
power
have
chosen
to
meet
reverses
rather
than
to
effect
anything
as
a
result
they
retained
their
safety
but
the
loss
fell
upon
their
own
heads
you
who
are
sure
to
reap
the
principal
benefit
from
both
classes
alike
the
inferior
and
the
superior
ought
never
to
choose
to
become
nominally
jealous
of
others
but
really
of
yourself
whatever
you
wish
your
subjects
to
think
and
do
must
say
and
do
you
can
better
educate
them
in
this
way
than
if
you
should
desire
to
terrify
them
by
the
severities
of
the
laws
the
former
course
inspires
emulation
the
latter
fear
and
any
one
can
more
easily
imitate
superior
conduct
when
he
actually
sees
it
in
some
life
than
he
can
guard
against
low
behavior
which
he
merely
hears
to
be
prohibited
by
edict
act
in
every
way
yourself
with
circumspection
not
condoning
any
mistakes
of
your
own
for
be
well
assured
that
all
will
straightway
learn
everything
you
say
and
do
you
will
live
as
it
were
in
a
kind
of
theatre
whose
audience
is
the
whole
world
and
it
will
not
be
possible
for
you
to
escape
detection
if
you
commit
the
very
smallest
error
no
act
of
yours
will
ever
be
in
private
but
all
of
them
will
be
performed
in
the
midst
of
many
persons
and
all
the
remainder
of
mankind
somehow
take
the
greatest
delight
in
being
officious
with
respect
to
what
is
done
by
their
rulers
hence
if
they
once
ascertain
that
you
are
urging
them
to
one
course
and
following
a
different
one
yourself
they
will
not
fear
your
threats
but
will
imitate
your
deeds
have
an
eye
to
the
lives
of
others
but
do
not
carry
your
investigations
unpleasantly
close
decide
cases
which
are
brought
before
you
by
outsiders
but
do
not
pretend
to
notice
conduct
that
receives
no
outspoken
censure
from
any
one
except
irregularities
not
consonant
with
public
interest
the
latter
ought
to
be
properly
rebuked
even
if
no
one
has
aught
to
say
against
them
other
private
failings
you
ought
to
know
in
order
to
avoid
making
a
mistake
some
day
by
employing
an
assistant
unsuitable
for
a
particular
duty
do
not
however
take
individuals
to
task
their
natures
impel
many
persons
to
commit
various
violations
of
the
law
if
you
make
an
unsparing
campaign
against
them
you
might
leave
scarcely
one
man
unpunished
but
if
you
humanely
mingle
consideration
with
the
strict
command
of
the
law
you
may
perhaps
bring
them
to
their
senses
for
the
law
though
necessarily
severe
in
its
punishments
can
not
always
conquer
nature
some
men
if
permitted
to
think
they
are
unobserved
or
if
moderately
admonished
improve
some
through
shame
at
being
discovered
and
others
through
fear
of
failure
the
next
time
whereas
when
they
are
openly
denounced
and
throw
compunction
to
the
winds
or
where
they
are
chastised
beyond
measure
they
overturn
and
trample
under
foot
all
law
and
order
and
obey
slavishly
the
impulses
of
their
nature
therefore
it
is
not
easy
to
discipline
all
of
them
nor
is
it
fitting
to
allow
some
of
them
to
continue
publicly
their
outrageous
conduct
this
is
the
way
i
advise
you
to
treat
people
offences
except
the
very
desperate
cases
and
you
should
honor
even
beyond
the
deserts
of
the
deed
whatever
they
do
rightly
in
this
way
you
can
best
make
them
refrain
from
baser
conduct
by
kindliness
and
cause
them
to
aim
at
what
is
better
by
liberality
have
no
dread
that
either
money
or
other
means
of
rewarding
those
who
do
well
will
ever
fail
you
i
think
those
deserving
of
good
treatment
will
prove
far
fewer
than
the
rewards
since
you
are
lord
of
so
much
land
and
sea
and
fear
not
that
any
who
are
benefited
will
commit
some
act
of
ingratitude
nothing
so
captivates
and
conciliates
any
one
be
he
foreigner
or
be
he
foe
as
freedom
from
wrongs
and
likewise
kindly
treatment
this
is
the
attitude
which
i
urge
you
to
assume
toward
others
for
your
own
part
allow
no
extraordinary
or
overweening
distinction
to
be
given
you
through
word
or
deed
by
the
senate
or
by
anybody
else
to
others
honor
which
you
confer
lends
adornment
but
to
your
own
self
nothing
can
be
given
that
is
greater
than
what
you
already
have
and
it
would
arouse
no
little
suspicion
of
failure
in
straightforwardness
none
of
the
ordinary
people
willingly
approves
of
having
any
such
distinction
voted
to
the
man
in
power
as
he
receives
everything
of
the
kind
from
himself
he
not
only
obtains
no
praise
for
it
but
becomes
a
instead
any
additional
brilliance
then
you
must
create
for
yourself
by
your
good
deeds
never
permit
gold
or
silver
images
of
yourself
to
be
made
they
are
not
only
costly
but
they
give
rise
to
plots
and
last
but
a
brief
time
you
must
build
in
the
very
hearts
of
men
others
out
of
benefits
conferred
which
shall
be
both
unalloyed
and
undying
again
do
not
ever
allow
a
temple
to
be
raised
to
yourself
large
amounts
of
money
are
spent
uselessly
on
such
objects
which
had
better
be
laid
out
upon
necessary
improvements
great
wealth
is
gathered
not
so
much
by
acquiring
a
great
deal
as
by
not
spending
a
great
deal
nor
does
a
temple
contribute
anything
to
any
one
glory
excellence
raises
many
men
to
the
level
of
the
gods
but
nobody
ever
yet
was
made
a
god
by
show
of
hands
hence
if
you
are
upright
and
rule
well
the
whole
earth
will
be
your
precinct
all
cities
your
temple
all
mankind
your
statues
in
their
thoughts
you
will
ever
be
enshrined
and
surrounded
by
good
repute
those
who
administer
their
power
in
any
other
way
are
not
only
not
magnified
by
sites
and
edifices
of
worship
though
these
be
the
choicest
in
all
the
cities
but
erect
for
themselves
therein
mute
detractors
which
become
trophies
of
their
baseness
memorials
of
their
injustice
and
the
longer
these
last
the
more
steadfastly
does
the
of
such
sovereigns
abide
therefore
if
you
desire
to
become
in
very
truth
immortal
act
in
this
way
and
further
reverence
the
divine
power
yourself
everywhere
in
every
way
following
our
belief
and
compel
others
to
honor
it
those
who
introduce
strange
ideas
about
it
you
should
both
hate
and
punish
not
only
for
the
sake
of
the
gods
because
if
a
man
despises
them
he
will
esteem
naught
else
sacred
but
because
such
persons
by
bringing
in
new
divinities
persuade
many
to
adopt
foreign
principles
of
law
as
a
result
conspiracies
factions
and
clubs
arise
which
are
far
from
desirable
under
a
monarchy
accordingly
do
not
grant
any
atheist
or
charlatan
the
right
to
be
at
large
the
art
of
soothsaying
is
a
necessary
one
and
you
should
by
all
means
appoint
some
men
to
be
diviners
and
augurs
to
whom
people
can
resort
who
desire
to
consult
them
on
any
matter
but
there
ought
to
be
no
workers
of
magic
at
all
such
men
tell
partly
truth
but
mostly
lies
and
frequently
inspire
many
of
their
followers
to
rebel
the
same
thing
is
true
of
many
who
pretend
to
be
philosophers
hence
i
urge
you
to
be
on
your
guard
against
them
do
not
because
you
have
come
in
contact
with
such
thoroughly
admirable
men
as
areus
and
athenodorus
think
that
all
the
rest
who
say
they
are
philosophers
are
like
them
some
use
this
profession
as
a
screen
to
work
untold
harm
to
both
populace
and
individuals
your
spirit
then
because
you
have
no
desire
for
anything
more
than
you
possess
ought
to
be
most
peaceful
whereas
your
equipment
should
be
most
warlike
in
order
that
no
one
ordinarily
may
either
wish
or
try
to
harm
you
but
if
he
should
that
he
may
be
punished
easily
and
instantly
for
these
and
other
reasons
it
is
requisite
for
some
persons
to
keep
their
ears
and
eyes
open
to
everything
appertaining
to
your
position
of
authority
in
order
that
you
may
not
fail
to
notice
anything
which
needs
guarding
against
or
setting
right
remember
however
that
you
must
not
trust
merely
to
all
they
say
but
investigate
their
words
carefully
there
are
many
who
some
through
hatred
of
certain
persons
others
out
of
desire
for
what
they
possess
or
as
a
favor
to
some
one
or
because
they
ask
money
and
do
not
receive
it
oppress
others
under
the
pretext
that
the
latter
are
rebellious
or
are
guilty
of
harboring
some
design
or
uttering
some
statement
against
the
supreme
ruler
therefore
it
is
not
right
to
pay
immediate
or
ready
attention
to
them
but
to
enquire
into
absolutely
everything
if
you
are
slow
in
believing
anybody
you
will
suffer
no
great
harm
but
if
you
are
hasty
you
may
make
a
mistake
which
can
not
easily
be
repaired
now
it
is
both
right
and
necessary
for
you
to
honor
the
excellent
both
among
the
freedmen
and
among
the
rest
of
your
associates
this
will
afford
you
great
renown
and
security
they
must
however
not
have
any
extraordinary
powers
but
all
carefully
moderate
their
conduct
that
so
you
may
not
be
ill
spoken
of
through
them
for
everything
they
do
whether
well
or
ill
will
be
accredited
to
you
and
the
estimate
of
yourself
to
be
made
by
all
men
will
depend
upon
what
you
permit
these
persons
to
do
do
not
then
allow
the
influential
either
to
make
unjust
gains
or
to
concern
themselves
with
blackmail
and
let
no
one
be
complained
of
for
influence
even
if
he
is
otherwise
irreproachable
defend
the
masses
vigorously
when
they
are
wronged
and
do
not
attend
too
easily
to
accusations
against
them
examine
every
deed
on
its
merits
not
being
suspicious
of
every
one
who
is
prominent
nor
believing
every
one
who
is
lower
in
the
social
scale
those
who
are
active
and
are
the
authors
of
any
useful
device
you
must
honor
but
the
idle
or
such
as
busy
themselves
with
petty
foolishness
you
must
hate
thus
your
subjects
will
be
inclined
to
the
former
conduct
because
of
the
benefits
attached
and
will
refrain
from
the
latter
on
account
of
the
penalties
and
will
become
better
as
individuals
and
more
serviceable
for
your
employment
in
the
public
service
it
is
an
excellent
achievement
also
to
render
private
disputes
as
few
as
possible
and
their
settlement
as
rapid
as
may
be
but
it
is
best
of
all
to
cut
short
the
impetuosity
of
communities
and
if
under
guise
of
some
appeals
to
your
sovereignty
and
safety
and
good
fortune
they
undertake
to
use
force
upon
anybody
or
to
undertake
exploits
or
expenditures
that
are
beyond
their
power
not
to
permit
it
you
should
abolish
altogether
their
enmities
and
rivalries
among
themselves
and
not
authorize
them
to
create
any
empty
titles
or
anything
else
which
will
breed
differences
between
them
all
will
readily
obey
you
both
in
this
and
in
every
other
matter
private
and
public
if
you
never
permit
any
one
to
transgress
this
rule
of
laws
makes
null
and
void
even
wisely
framed
precepts
consequently
you
should
not
allow
persons
to
ask
for
what
you
are
not
accustomed
to
give
try
to
compel
them
to
avoid
diligently
this
very
practice
of
petitioning
for
something
prohibited
this
is
what
i
have
to
say
on
that
subject
i
advise
you
never
to
make
use
of
your
authority
against
all
the
citizens
at
once
nor
to
deem
it
in
any
way
curtailed
if
you
do
not
do
absolutely
everything
that
is
within
your
power
but
in
proportion
as
you
are
able
to
carry
out
all
your
wishes
you
must
be
anxious
to
wish
only
what
is
proper
make
always
a
to
see
whether
what
you
are
doing
is
right
or
not
what
conduct
will
cause
people
to
love
you
and
what
not
in
order
that
you
may
perform
the
one
set
of
acts
and
avoid
the
other
do
not
admit
the
thought
that
you
will
sufficiently
escape
the
reputation
of
acting
contrary
to
this
rule
if
only
you
hear
no
one
censuring
you
and
do
not
look
for
any
one
to
be
so
mad
as
to
reproach
you
openly
for
anything
no
one
would
do
this
not
even
if
he
should
be
violently
wronged
quite
the
reverse
many
are
compelled
in
public
to
praise
their
oppressors
and
while
engaged
in
opposition
not
to
manifest
their
wrath
the
ruler
must
infer
the
disposition
of
people
not
from
what
they
say
but
from
the
way
it
is
natural
for
them
to
feel
this
and
a
similar
policy
is
the
one
i
wish
you
to
pursue
i
pass
over
many
matters
because
it
is
not
feasible
to
speak
of
them
all
at
one
time
and
within
present
limits
one
suggestion
therefore
i
will
make
to
sum
up
both
previous
remarks
and
whatever
is
lacking
if
you
yourself
by
your
own
motion
do
whatever
you
would
wish
some
one
else
who
ruled
you
to
do
you
will
make
no
mistakes
and
will
be
always
successful
and
consequently
your
life
will
be
most
pleasant
and
free
from
danger
how
can
all
fail
to
regard
you
and
to
love
you
as
father
and
preserver
when
they
see
you
are
orderly
leading
a
good
life
good
at
warfare
but
a
man
of
peace
when
you
are
not
wanton
do
not
defraud
when
you
meet
them
on
a
footing
of
equality
and
do
not
yourself
grow
rich
while
demanding
money
from
others
are
not
yourself
given
to
luxury
while
imposing
hardships
upon
others
are
not
yourself
unbridled
while
reproving
others
when
instead
your
life
in
every
way
without
exception
is
precisely
like
theirs
be
of
good
cheer
for
you
have
in
your
own
hands
a
great
safeguard
by
never
wronging
another
and
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
you
will
never
be
the
object
of
hatred
or
plots
since
this
is
so
you
must
quite
inevitably
lead
a
pleasant
life
what
is
pleasanter
what
is
more
conducive
to
prosperity
than
to
enjoy
in
a
rightful
way
all
the
blessings
among
men
and
to
have
the
power
of
granting
them
to
others
with
this
in
mind
together
with
all
the
rest
that
i
have
told
you
heed
my
advice
and
let
not
that
fortune
slip
which
has
chosen
you
out
of
all
and
set
you
at
the
head
of
all
if
you
would
choose
the
substance
of
monarch
but
fear
the
name
of
as
accursed
then
refrain
from
taking
possession
of
the
latter
and
be
satisfied
to
employ
merely
the
title
of
if
you
need
any
further
appellations
they
will
give
you
that
of
as
they
gave
it
to
your
father
they
will
reverence
you
also
by
still
another
name
so
that
you
may
obtain
all
the
advantages
of
a
kingdom
without
the
disfavor
that
attaches
to
the
term
itself
mæcenas
thus
brought
his
speech
to
an
end
cæsar
thanked
them
both
heartily
for
their
many
ideas
the
exhaustiveness
of
their
exposition
and
their
frankness
he
rather
inclined
however
to
the
proposition
of
mæcenas
yet
he
did
not
immediately
put
into
practice
all
of
the
suggestions
for
fear
that
he
might
meet
with
some
setback
if
he
wanted
to
reform
men
in
multitudes
so
he
made
some
changes
for
the
better
at
once
and
others
later
he
left
some
things
also
for
those
who
should
come
to
the
head
of
the
state
afterward
to
do
as
might
be
found
more
opportune
in
the
progress
of
time
agrippa
coöperated
with
him
in
all
his
projects
quite
zealously
in
spite
of
having
stated
a
contrary
opinion
just
as
if
he
had
been
the
one
to
propose
the
plan
cæsar
did
this
and
what
i
have
recorded
earlier
in
the
narrative
in
that
year
when
he
was
consul
for
the
seventh
time
and
added
the
title
of
i
do
not
refer
to
the
title
anciently
granted
some
persons
for
victories
this
he
received
many
times
before
and
many
times
later
for
his
deeds
themselves
so
that
he
had
the
name
of
imperator
times
but
to
the
other
one
which
signifies
supreme
power
just
as
they
had
voted
to
his
father
cæsar
and
to
the
children
and
descendants
of
the
same
after
this
he
entered
upon
a
censorship
with
agrippa
and
besides
setting
aright
some
other
business
he
investigated
the
senate
many
knights
and
many
too
who
did
not
deserve
it
were
in
the
senate
as
a
result
of
the
civil
wars
so
that
the
total
of
that
body
amounted
to
a
thousand
these
he
wished
to
remove
but
did
not
himself
erase
any
of
their
names
urging
them
to
become
their
own
judges
out
of
the
consciousness
of
their
family
and
their
life
so
first
he
persuaded
fifty
of
them
to
retire
voluntarily
from
the
assemblage
and
then
compelled
one
hundred
and
forty
others
to
imitate
their
example
he
disenfranchised
none
of
them
but
posted
the
names
of
the
second
division
in
the
case
of
the
first
because
they
had
not
delayed
but
had
straightway
obeyed
him
he
remitted
the
reproach
and
their
identity
was
not
made
public
these
accordingly
returned
willingly
to
private
life
he
ousted
quintus
statilius
very
much
against
the
latter
will
from
the
tribuneship
to
which
he
had
been
appointed
some
others
he
made
senators
and
he
counted
among
the
two
men
of
the
senatorial
class
a
certain
cluvius
and
gaius
furnius
because
they
had
been
appointed
first
though
certain
others
had
taken
possession
of
their
offices
so
that
they
were
unable
to
become
consuls
he
added
to
the
class
of
patricians
the
senate
allowing
him
to
do
this
because
most
of
its
members
had
perished
no
element
is
exhausted
so
fast
in
civil
wars
as
the
nobility
or
is
deemed
to
be
so
necessary
for
the
continuance
of
ancestral
customs
in
addition
to
the
above
measures
he
forbade
all
persons
in
the
senate
to
go
outside
of
italy
unless
he
himself
should
order
or
permit
any
one
of
them
to
do
so
this
custom
is
still
kept
up
at
the
present
day
except
that
he
may
visit
sicily
and
gallia
narbonensis
no
senator
is
allowed
to
go
anywhere
out
of
the
country
as
these
regions
are
close
at
hand
and
the
population
is
unarmed
and
peaceful
those
who
have
any
possessions
there
have
been
granted
the
right
to
take
trips
to
them
as
often
as
they
like
without
asking
since
also
he
saw
that
many
of
the
senators
and
of
the
others
who
had
been
devoted
to
antony
still
maintained
an
attitude
of
suspicion
toward
him
and
as
he
was
afraid
they
might
cause
some
uprising
he
announced
that
all
the
letters
found
in
his
rival
chest
had
been
burned
some
of
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
perished
but
the
majority
of
them
he
took
pains
to
preserve
and
did
not
even
hesitate
to
use
them
later
besides
these
acts
related
he
also
settled
carthage
anew
because
lepidus
had
laid
waste
a
part
of
it
and
for
that
reason
he
maintained
that
the
colonists
rights
of
settlement
had
been
abrogated
he
summoned
antiochus
of
commagene
to
appear
before
him
because
this
prince
had
treacherously
slain
an
envoy
despatched
to
rome
by
his
brother
who
was
at
variance
with
him
cæsar
brought
him
before
the
senate
where
he
was
condemned
and
the
sentence
of
death
imposed
capreæ
was
also
obtained
from
the
neapolitans

it

anciently

which
belonged
to
an
incumbent
of

consulship
while
he
himself
used

completing

he
had
the
oath
administered
according
to
ancestral
custom
whether
he
ever
did
this
again
i
do
not
know
agrippa
he
honored
exceedingly
even
going
so
far
as
to
give
him
his
niece
in
marriage
and
to
provide
him
with
a
tent
similar
to
his
own
whenever
they
went
on
a
campaign
together
and
the
watchword
was
given
by
both
of
them
at
that
particular
time
besides
attending
to
the
ordinary
run
of
business
he
finished
the
taking
of
the
census
in
which
he
was
called
as
had
been
deemed
proper
under
the
real
democracy
he
further
completed
and
dedicated
the
temple
of
apollo
on
the
palatine
the
precinct
surrounding
it
and
the
stores
of
books
and
he
celebrated
in
company
with
agrippa
the
festival
in
honor
of
the
victory
won
at
actium
which
had
been
voted
in
it
he
had
the
between
boys
and
between
men
of
the
nobility
this
celebration
every
five
years
as
long
as
it
lasted
was
in
charge
of
the
four
priesthoods
in
succession
i
mean
the
pontifices
and
augurs
and
the
septemviri
and
quindecimviri
a
gymnastic
contest
was
also
held
at
that
time
a
wooden
stadium
being
built
in
the
campus
martius
and
there
was
an
armed
combat
of
captives
this
continued
for
several
days
without
a
break
in
spite
of
cæsar
falling
sick
for
even
so
agrippa
filled
his
place
cæsar
spent
some
of
his
private
means
upon
the
festivals
and
when
money
was
needed
for
the
public
treasury
he
borrowed
it
and
supplied
the
want
for
the
management
of
this
branch
of
the
service
he
ordered
two
annual
magistrates
to
be
chosen
from
among
the
to
the
populace
he
distributed
a
quadruple
allowance
of
grain
and
made
a
present
of
money
to
some
of
the
senators
for
many
of
them
had
grown
so
poor
as
not
to
be
willing
to
be
even
ædile
on
account
of
the
great
expenses
moreover
the
courts
which
belonged
to
the
ædileship
were
to
be
assigned
to
the
prætors
as
had
been
the
custom
the
more
important
to
the
prætor
urbanus
and
the
others
to
the
prætor
peregrinus
again
he
himself
appointed
the
prætor
urbanus
as
he
often
did
subsequently
the
pledges
deposited
with
the
public
treasury
before
the
battle
of
actium
he
released
save
any
that
involved
house
property
and
burned
the
old
acknowledgments
of
those
who
owed
the
state
anything
egyptian
rites
he
did
not
admit
within
the
pomerium
but
paid
great
attention
to
the
temples
of
egyptian
deities
such
as
had
been
built
by
private
individuals
he
ordered
their
children
and
descendants
if
any
survived
to
repair
and
the
rest
he
restored
himself
he
did
not
however
appropriate
the
credit
for
their
building
but
allowed
it
to
rest
with
those
who
had
originally
constructed
them
and
since
very
many
unlawful
and
unjust
ordinances
had
been
passed
during
the
internecine
strifes
and
in
the
wars
and
particularly
in
the
dual
reign
of
antony
and
lepidus
he
abolished
them
all
by
one
promulgation
setting
his
sixth
consulship
as
the
limit
of
their
existence
as
he
obtained
approbation
and
praise
for
this
act
he
desired
to
exhibit
another
instance
of
magnanimity
that
by
such
a
policy
he
might
be
honored
the
more
and
that
his
supremacy
might
be
voluntarily
confirmed
by
the
people
which
would
enable
him
to
avoid
the
appearance
of
having
forced
them
against
their
will
as
a
consequence
after
apprising
those
senators
with
whom
he
was
most
intimate
of
his
designs
he
entered
the
senatorial
body
in
his
seventh
consulship
and
read
the
following
document
i
am
sure
that
i
shall
seem
to
some
of
you
conscript
fathers
to
have
made
an
incredible
choice
for
what
each
one
of
my
hearers
would
not
wish
to
do
himself
he
does
not
like
to
believe
when
another
states
it
as
accomplished
this
is
chiefly
because
every
one
is
jealous
of
every
one
who
surpasses
him
and
is
more
or
less
inclined
to
distrust
anything
said
that
is
higher
than
his
own
standard
moreover
i
know
this
that
those
who
make
apparently
untrustworthy
statements
not
only
persuade
nobody
but
further
have
the
appearance
of
cheats
and
indeed
if
it
were
a
case
of
announcing
something
that
i
was
not
intending
to
do
immediately
i
should
hesitate
very
much
about
making
it
public
for
fear
of
obtaining
some
unworthy
charge
against
me
instead
of
gratitude
but
as
it
is
when
the
performance
will
follow
the
promise
this
very
day
i
feel
entirely
confident
not
only
of
avoiding
any
shame
for
prevarication
but
of
surpassing
all
mankind
in
good
repute
you
all
see
that
i
am
so
situated
that
i
could
rule
you
perpetually
all
the
revolutionists
either
have
been
disciplined
and
been
made
to
halt
or
have
had
pity
shown
them
and
so
have
come
to
their
senses
my
helpers
have
been
made
devoted
by
a
recompense
of
benefits
and
steadfast
by
a
participation
in
the
government
therefore
they
do
not
desire
any
political
innovations
and
if
anything
of
the
sort
should
take
place
the
men
to
assist
me
are
even
more
ready
for
it
than
the
instigators
of
rebellion
my
military
is
in
prime
condition
we
have
strength
money
and
allies
and
chiefest
of
all
you
and
the
people
are
so
disposed
toward
me
that
you
would
be
quite
willing
to
have
me
at
your
head
however
i
will
lead
you
no
longer
nor
shall
any
one
say
that
all
the
acts
of
my
previous
career
have
been
with
the
object
of
sole
rulership
i
give
up
the
entire
domain
and
i
restore
to
you
absolutely
everything
the
arms
the
laws
and
the
provinces
not
only
all
those
which
you
committed
to
me
but
also
all
that
i
myself
subsequently
acquired
for
you
thus
by
my
deeds
themselves
you
may
ascertain
that
i
did
not
from
the
outset
desire
any
position
of
power
but
wished
in
very
truth
to
avenge
my
father
cruelly
murdered
and
to
extricate
the
city
from
great
and
continuous
evils
i
would
that
i
had
never
taken
charge
of
affairs
even
to
the
present
extent
that
is
i
would
that
the
city
had
never
needed
me
for
any
such
purpose
but
that
we
of
this
age
had
from
the
outset
lived
in
peace
and
harmony
as
our
fathers
once
did
but
since
an
inflexible
fate
as
it
seems
brought
you
to
a
place
where
there
was
need
even
of
me
though
i
was
still
young
and
i
was
put
to
the
test
i
was
always
ready
to
labor
zealously
at
everything
even
beyond
what
was
expected
of
my
years
so
long
as
the
situation
demanded
my
help
and
i
accomplished
everything
with
good
fortune
even
surpassing
my
powers
there
was
not
one
consideration
out
of
all
that
might
be
cited
which
could
turn
me
from
aiding
you
when
you
were
in
danger
not
toil
or
fear
or
threats
of
foes
or
prayers
of
friends
or
the
numbers
of
the
confederates
or
the
desperation
of
our
adversaries
i
gave
myself
to
you
unsparingly
for
all
the
tasks
that
fell
to
our
lot
and
my
performances
and
sufferings
you
know
from
it
i
myself
have
derived
no
gain
except
that
i
caused
my
country
to
survive
but
you
are
both
preserved
and
in
your
sober
senses
since
then
the
gracious
act
of
fortune
has
restored
to
you
by
my
hands
peace
without
treachery
and
harmony
without
turmoil
receive
back
also
liberty
and
democracy
take
possession
of
the
arms
and
the
subject
nations
and
conduct
the
government
as
has
been
your
wont
you
should
not
be
surprised
at
my
attitude
when
you
see
my
right
conduct
in
other
ways
my
mildness
and
freedom
from
meddling
and
reflect
moreover
that
i
have
never
accepted
any
extraordinary
privilege
beyond
what
the
majority
might
gain
though
you
have
often
voted
many
of
them
to
me
do
not
again
condemn
me
for
folly
because
when
it
is
in
my
power
to
rule
over
you
and
hold
so
great
a
sovereignty
over
this
great
world
i
am
unwilling
examining
the
merits
of
the
situation
i
deem
it
most
just
for
you
to
manage
your
own
affairs
examining
the
advantages
i
regard
it
as
most
advantageous
to
myself
to
be
free
from
trouble
from
jealousy
from
plots
and
for
you
to
conduct
a
free
government
with
moderation
and
love
examining
where
the
glory
lies
for
the
sake
of
which
men
often
choose
to
enter
war
and
danger
will
it
not
add
most
to
my
reputation
to
resign
so
great
a
dominion
will
it
not
be
most
glorious
to
leave
so
exalted
a
sovereignty
and
voluntarily
become
a
plain
citizen
so
if
any
one
of
you
doubts
that
any
one
else
could
show
true
moderation
in
this
and
bring
himself
to
speak
out
let
him
at
all
events
believe
me
for
though
i
could
recite
many
great
benefits
which
have
been
conferred
upon
you
by
me
and
by
my
father
for
which
you
would
naturally
love
and
honor
us
above
all
the
rest
i
could
say
nothing
greater
and
i
should
take
pride
in
nothing
else
more
than
this
that
he
would
not
accept
the
monarchy
which
you
strove
to
give
him
and
that
i
holding
it
lay
it
aside
what
need
to
set
side
by
side
his
separate
exploits
the
conquest
of
gaul
the
subduing
of
moesia
the
subjugation
of
egypt
the
enslaving
of
pannonia
or
again
pharnaces
juba
phraates
the
campaign
against
the
britons
the
crossing
of
the
rhine
yet
these
are
greater
and
more
important
deeds
than
all
our
forefathers
performed
in
all
previous
time
still
any
of
these
accomplishments
scarcely
deserves
a
place
beside
my
present
act
nor
yet
indeed
does
the
fact
that
the
civil
wars
the
greatest
and
most
diverse
that
have
occurred
in
the
history
of
man
we
fought
to
a
successful
finish
and
that
we
made
humane
terms
overcoming
all
who
withstood
us
as
enemies
and
saving
alive
all
who
yielded
as
friends
so
that
if
our
city
should
ever
again
be
fated
to
suffer
from
disaffection
we
might
pray
that
the
quarrel
should
follow
this
same
course
for
that
in
spite
of
our
possessing
such
great
power
and
standing
at
the
summit
of
excellence
and
good
fortune
so
that
we
might
govern
you
willing
or
unwilling
we
should
neither
lose
our
heads
nor
desire
sole
supremacy
but
that
instead
he
should
reject
it
when
offered
and
i
return
it
when
given
is
a
superhuman
achievement
i
speak
in
this
way
not
for
idle
boasting
i
should
not
have
said
it
at
all
if
i
were
to
derive
any
advantage
whatever
from
it
but
in
order
that
you
may
see
that
whereas
there
are
many
public
benefits
to
our
credit
and
we
have
in
private
many
lofty
titles
we
take
greatest
pride
in
this
that
what
others
desire
to
gain
even
by
doing
violence
to
their
neighbors
we
surrender
without
any
compulsion
who
could
be
found
more
magnanimous
than
i
not
to
mention
again
my
father
deceased
or
whose
conduct
more
godlike
with
so
many
fine
soldiers
at
my
back
and
citizens
and
allies
o
jupiter
and
hercules
that
love
me
supreme
over
the
entire
sea
within
the
pillars
of
hercules
except
a
very
few
tribes
possessing
both
cities
and
provinces
on
all
the
continents
at
a
time
when
there
is
no
longer
any
foreign
enemy
opposing
me
and
there
is
no
disturbance
at
home
but
you
all
are
at
peace
harmonious
and
strong
and
greatest
of
all
are
willingly
obedient
under
such
conditions
i
voluntarily
of
my
own
motion
resign
so
great
a
dominion
and
alienate
so
vast
a
property
for
if
horatius
mucius
curtius
regulus
the
decii
wished
to
encounter
danger
and
death
with
the
object
of
seeming
to
have
done
a
great
and
noble
deed
why
should
i
not
even
more
desire
to
do
this
as
a
result
of
which
i
shall
while
alive
excel
both
them
and
all
the
rest
of
mankind
in
glory
no
one
of
you
should
think
that
whereas
the
ancient
romans
pursued
excellence
and
good
repute
all
manliness
has
now
become
extinct
in
the
city
again
do
not
entertain
a
suspicion
that
i
wish
to
betray
you
and
confide
you
to
any
base
fellows
or
expose
you
to
mob
rule
from
which
nothing
good
but
all
the
most
terrible
evils
always
result
to
mankind
upon
you
upon
you
the
most
excellent
and
prudent
i
lay
all
public
interests
the
other
course
i
should
never
have
followed
had
it
been
necessary
for
me
to
die
or
even
to
become
monarch
ten
thousand
times
this
policy
i
adopt
for
my
own
good
and
for
that
of
the
city
i
myself
have
undergone
both
labors
and
hardships
and
i
can
no
longer
hold
out
either
in
mind
or
in
body
furthermore
i
foresee
the
jealousy
and
hatred
which
rises
in
the
breasts
of
some
against
the
best
men
and
the
plots
which
result
from
those
feelings
and
for
that
reason
i
choose
rather
to
be
a
private
citizen
with
glory
than
to
be
a
monarch
in
danger
and
the
public
business
would
be
managed
much
better
if
carried
on
publicly
and
by
many
people
at
once
than
if
it
were
dependent
upon
any
one
man
for
these
reasons
then
i
supplicate
and
beseech
all
of
you
both
to
commend
my
course
and
to
coöperate
heartily
with
me
reflecting
upon
all
that
i
have
done
for
you
in
war
and
in
government
you
will
be
paying
me
all
the
thanks
due
for
it
by
allowing
me
now
at
last
to
lead
a
life
of
quiet
thus
you
will
come
to
know
that
i
understand
not
only
how
to
rule
but
to
be
ruled
and
that
all
commands
which
i
have
laid
upon
others
i
can
endure
to
have
laid
upon
me
i
must
surely
expect
to
live
in
security
and
to
suffer
no
harm
from
any
one
by
either
deed
or
word
such
is
the
confidence
based
upon
the
consciousness
of
my
own
rectitude
that
i
have
in
your
i
may
of
course
meet
with
some
catastrophe
as
happens
to
many
for
it
is
not
possible
for
a
man
to
please
everybody
especially
when
he
has
been
involved
in
so
great
wars
some
foreign
and
some
civil
and
has
had
affairs
of
such
magnitude
entrusted
to
him
yet
even
so
i
am
quite
ready
to
choose
to
die
as
a
private
citizen
before
my
appointed
time
rather
than
to
become
immortal
as
a
sole
ruler
that
very
circumstance
will
bring
me
fame
that
i
not
only
murdered
no
one
in
order
to
hold
possession
of
the
sovereignty
but
even
died
untimely
in
order
to
avoid
becoming
monarch
the
man
who
has
dared
to
slay
me
will
certainly
be
punished
by
heaven
and
by
you
as
took
place
in
the
case
of
my
father
he
was
declared
to
be
equal
to
a
god
and
obtained
eternal
honors
whereas
those
who
slew
him
perished
the
evil
men
in
evil
plight
we
could
not
become
deathless
yet
by
living
well
and
by
dying
well
we
do
in
a
sense
gain
this
boon
therefore
i
who
possess
the
first
requisite
and
hope
to
possess
the
second
return
to
you
the
arms
and
the
provinces
the
revenues
and
the
laws
i
make
only
this
final
suggestion
that
you
be
not
disheartened
through
fear
of
the
magnitude
of
affairs
or
the
difficulty
of
handling
them
nor
neglect
them
in
disdain
with
the
idea
that
they
can
be
easily
managed
i
have
indeed
no
objection
to
suggesting
to
you
in
a
summary
way
what
ought
to
be
done
in
each
of
the
leading
categories
and
what
are
these
suggestions
first
guard
vigilantly
the
established
laws
and
change
none
of
them
what
remains
fixed
though
it
be
inferior
is
more
advantageous
than
what
is
always
subject
to
innovations
even
though
it
seem
to
be
superior
next
whatever
injunctions
these
laws
lay
upon
you
be
careful
to
perform
and
to
refrain
from
whatever
they
forbid
and
do
this
scrupulously
not
only
in
word
but
also
in
deed
not
only
in
public
but
in
private
that
you
may
obtain
not
penalties
but
honors
the
offices
both
of
peace
and
of
war
you
should
entrust
to
those
who
are
each
time
the
most
excellent
and
sensible
without
jealousy
of
any
persons
and
entering
into
rivalry
not
that
this
man
or
that
man
may
reap
some
advantage
but
that
the
city
may
be
preserved
and
prosperous
such
men
you
must
honor
but
chastise
those
who
show
any
different
spirit
in
politics
make
your
private
means
public
property
of
the
city
and
keep
your
hands
off
public
money
as
you
would
off
your
neighbors
goods
keep
careful
watch
over
what
belongs
to
you
but
be
not
eager
for
that
upon
which
you
can
have
no
claim
treat
the
allies
and
subject
nations
with
neither
insolence
nor
rapacity
and
neither
wrong
nor
fear
the
enemy
have
your
arms
always
in
hand
but
do
not
use
them
against
one
another
nor
against
a
peaceful
population
give
the
soldiers
a
sufficient
support
so
that
they
may
not
on
account
of
want
desire
anything
which
belongs
to
others
keep
them
together
and
discipline
them
to
prevent
their
doing
any
damage
through
audacity
but
why
need
i
make
a
long
story
by
going
into
everything
which
it
is
your
duty
to
do
you
may
easily
understand
from
this
how
the
remaining
business
must
be
conducted
i
will
close
with
this
one
remark
if
you
conduct
the
government
in
this
way
you
will
enjoy
prosperity
yourselves
and
you
will
gratify
me
who
found
you
in
the
midst
of
wretched
dishonor
and
have
rendered
you
such
as
you
are
if
you
prove
impotent
to
carry
out
any
single
branch
as
you
should
you
will
cause
me
regret
and
you
will
cast
the
city
again
into
many
wars
and
great
dangers
while
cæsar
was
engaged
in
setting
his
decision
before
them
a
varied
feeling
took
possession
of
the
senators
a
few
of
them
knew
his
real
intention
and
as
a
result
they
kept
applauding
him
enthusiastically
of
the
rest
some
were
suspicious
of
what
was
said
and
others
believed
in
it
and
therefore
both
marveled
equally
the
one
class
at
his
great
artifice
and
the
other
at
the
determination
that
he
had
reached
one
side
was
displeased
at
his
involved
scheming
and
the
other
at
his
change
of
mind
for
already
there
were
some
who
detested
the
democratic
constitution
as
a
breeder
of
factional
difficulties
were
pleased
at
the
change
of
government
and
took
delight
in
cæsar
consequently
though
the
announcement
affected
different
persons
differently
their
views
in
regard
to
it
were
in
each
case
the
same
as
for
those
who
believed
his
sentiments
to
be
genuine
any
who
wished
it
could
not
rejoice
because
of
fear
nor
the
others
lament
because
of
hopes
and
as
many
as
disbelieved
it
did
not
venture
to
accuse
him
and
confute
him
some
because
they
were
afraid
and
others
because
they
did
not
care
to
do
so
hence
they
all
either
were
compelled
or
pretended
to
believe
him
as
for
praising
him
some
did
not
have
the
courage
and
others
were
unwilling
even
in
the
midst
of
his
reading
there
were
frequent
shouts
and
afterward
many
more
the
senators
begged
that
a
monarchy
be
established
and
directed
all
their
remarks
to
that
end
until
naturally
they
forced
him
to
assume
the
reins
of
government
at
once
they
saw
to
it
that
twice
as
much
pay
was
voted
to
the
men
who
were
to
compose
his
as
to
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
that
this
might
incite
the
men
to
keep
a
careful
watch
of
him
then
he
began
to
show
a
real
interest
in
setting
up
a
monarchy
in
this
way
he
had
his
headship
ratified
by
the
senate
and
the
people
as
he
wished
even
so
to
appear
to
be
democratic
in
principle
he
accepted
all
the
care
and
superintendence
of
public
business
on
the
ground
that
it
required
expert
attention
but
said
that
he
should
not
personally
govern
all
the
provinces
and
those
that
he
did
govern
he
should
not
keep
in
his
charge
perpetually
the
weaker
ones
because
as
he
said
they
were
peaceful
and
free
from
war
he
gave
over
to
the
senate
but
the
more
powerful
he
held
in
possession
because
they
were
slippery
and
dangerous
and
either
had
enemies
in
adjoining
territory
or
on
their
own
account
were
able
to
cause
a
great
uprising
his
pretext
was
that
the
senate
should
fearlessly
gather
the
fruits
of
the
finest
portion
of
the
empire
while
he
himself
had
the
labors
and
dangers
his
real
purpose
was
that
by
this
plan
the
senators
be
unarmed
and
unprepared
for
battle
while
he
alone
had
arms
and
kept
soldiers
africa
and
numidia
asia
and
greece
with
epirus
the
dalmatian
and
macedonian
territories
sicily
crete
and
libya
adjacent
to
cyrene
bithynia
with
the
adjoining
pontus
sardinia
and
baetica
were
consequently
held
to
belong
to
the
people
and
the
senate
cæsar
were
the
remainder
of
spain
the
neighborhood
of
tarraco
and
lusitania
all
gauls
the
narbonensian
and
the
lugdunensian
the
aquitani
and
the
belgæ
both
themselves
and
the
aliens
among
them
some
of
the
celtae
whom
we
call
germani
had
occupied
all
the
belgic
territory
near
the
rhine
and
caused
it
to
be
called
germania
the
upper
part
extending
to
the
sources
of
the
river
and
the
lower
part
reaching
to
the
ocean
of
britain
these
provinces
then
and
the
hollow
syria
phoenicia
and
cilicia
cyprus
and
the
egyptians
fell
at
that
time
to
cæsar
share
later
he
gave
cyprus
and
gaul
adjacent
to
narbo
back
to
the
people
and
he
himself
took
dalmatia
instead
this
was
also
done
subsequently
in
the
case
of
other
provinces
as
the
progress
of
my
narrative
will
show
i
have
enumerated
these
in
such
detail
because
now
each
one
of
them
is
ruled
separately
whereas
in
old
times
and
for
a
long
period
the
provinces
were
governed
two
and
three
together
the
others
i
have
not
mentioned
because
some
of
them
were
acquired
later
and
the
rest
even
if
they
had
been
already
subdued
were
not
being
governed
by
the
romans
but
either
were
left
to
enjoy
their
own
laws
or
had
been
turned
over
to
some
kingdom
or
other
all
of
them
that
after
this
came
into
the
roman
empire
were
attached
to
the
possessions
of
the
man
temporarily
in
this
then
was
the
division
of
the
provinces
wishing
to
lead
the
romans
still
further
away
from
the
idea
that
he
looked
upon
himself
as
absolute
monarch
cæsar
undertook
the
government
of
the
regions
given
him
for
ten
years
in
the
course
of
this
time
he
promised
to
reduce
them
to
quiet
and
he
carried
his
playfulness
to
the
point
of
saying
that
if
they
should
be
sooner
pacified
he
would
deliver
them
sooner
to
the
senate
thereupon
he
first
appointed
the
senators
themselves
to
govern
both
classes
of
provinces
except
egypt
this
land
alone
for
the
reasons
mentioned
he
assigned
to
the
knight
previously
named
next
he
ordained
that
the
rulers
of
senatorial
provinces
should
be
annual
magistrates
elected
by
lot
unless
any
one
had
the
special
privilege
accorded
to
a
large
number
of
children
or
marriage
they
were
to
be
sent
out
by
the
assembly
of
the
senate
as
a
body
with
no
sword
at
their
side
nor
wearing
the
military
garb
the
name
proconsul
was
to
belong
not
only
to
the
two
but
also
to
the
rest
who
had
served
as
prætors
or
who
at
least
held
the
rank
of
both
classes
were
to
employ
as
many
lictors
as
were
usual
in
the
capital
he
ordered
further
that
they
were
to
put
on
the
insignia
of
their
office
immediately
on
leaving
the
pomerium
and
were
to
wear
them
continually
until
they
should
return
the
heads
of
imperial
provinces
on
the
other
hand
were
to
be
chosen
by
himself
and
be
his
agents
and
they
were
to
be
named
proprætors
even
if
they
were
from
the
ranks
of
the
of
these
two
names
which
had
been
extremely
common
under
the
democracy
he
gave
that
of
prætor
to
the
class
chosen
by
him
because
from
very
early
times
war
had
been
their
care
and
he
called
them
also
proprætors
the
name
of
consul
he
gave
to
the
others
because
their
duties
were
more
peaceful
and
called
them
in
addition
proconsuls
these
particular
names
of
prætor
and
consul
he
continued
in
italy
and
spoke
of
all
officials
outside
as
governing
as
their
representatives
he
caused
the
class
of
his
own
choosing
to
employ
the
title
of
proprætor
and
to
hold
office
for
as
much
longer
than
a
year
as
should
please
him
wearing
the
military
costume
and
having
a
sword
with
which
they
are
empowered
to
punish
soldiers
no
one
else
proconsul
or
proprætor
or
procurator
who
is
not
empowered
to
kill
a
soldier
has
been
given
the
privilege
of
wearing
a
sword
it
is
permitted
not
only
to
senators
but
also
to
knights
who
have
this
function
this
is
the
condition
of
the
all
the
proprætors
alike
employ
six
lictors
as
many
of
them
as
do
not
belong
to
the
number
of
are
named
from
this
very
number
both
classes
alike
assume
the
decorations
of
their
position
of
authority
when
they
enter
their
appointed
district
and
lay
them
aside
immediately
upon
finishing
their
term
it
is
thus
and
on
these
conditions
that
governors
from
among
the
and
have
been
customarily
sent
to
both
kinds
of
provinces
the
emperor
would
send
one
of
them
on
his
mission
whithersoever
and
whenever
he
wished
many
while
acting
as
prætors
and
consuls
secured
the
presidency
of
provinces
as
sometimes
happens
at
the
present
day
in
the
case
of
the
senate
he
privately
gave
africa
and
asia
to
the
and
all
the
other
districts
to
the
he
publicly
forbade
all
the
senators
to
cast
lots
for
anybody
until
five
years
after
such
a
candidate
had
held
office
in
the
city
for
a
short
time
all
persons
that
fulfilled
these
requirements
even
if
they
were
more
numerous
than
the
provinces
drew
lots
for
them
later
as
some
of
them
did
not
govern
well
this
i
appointment
too
reverted
to
the
emperor
thus
they
also
in
a
sense
receive
their
position
from
him
and
he
ordains
that
only
a
number
equal
to
the
number
of
provinces
shall
draw
lots
and
that
they
shall
be
whatever
men
he
pleases
some
emperors
have
sent
men
of
their
own
choosing
there
also
and
have
allowed
certain
of
them
to
hold
office
for
more
than
a
year
some
have
assigned
certain
provinces
to
knights
instead
of
to
senators
these
were
the
customs
thus
established
at
that
time
in
regard
to
those
senators
that
were
authorized
to
execute
the
death
penalty
upon
their
subjects
some
who
have
not
this
authority
are
sent
out
to
the
provinces
called
provinces
of
the
senate
and
the
people
namely
such
quæstors
as
the
lot
may
designate
and
men
who
are
with
those
who
hold
the
actual
authority
this
would
be
the
correct
way
to
speak
of
these
associates
with
reference
not
to
the
ordinary
name
but
to
their
duties
others
call
these
also
using
the
greek
term
about
this
title
enough
has
been
said
in
the
foregoing
narrative
each
separate
official
chooses
his
own
assessors
the
exprætors
selecting
one
from
either
their
peers
or
their
inferiors
and
the
three
from
among
those
of
equal
rank
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
emperor
there
were
certain
innovations
made
also
in
regard
to
these
men
but
since
they
soon
lapsed
this
is
sufficient
to
say
here
this
is
the
method
followed
in
regard
to
the
provinces
of
the
people
to
the
others
called
provinces
of
the
emperor
which
have
more
than
one
citizenlegion
lieutenants
are
sent
chosen
by
the
ruler
himself
generally
from
the
but
in
some
instances
already
from
the
or
those
who
had
held
some
office
between
the
two
those
positions
then
appertain
to
the
senators
from
among
the
knights
the
emperor
himself
despatches
some
to
the
citizen
posts
alone
but
others
to
foreign
places
according
to
the
custom
then
instituted
by
the
same
cæsar
the
military
tribunes
the
prospective
senators
and
the
remainder
concerning
whose
difference
in
rank
i
have
previously
spoken
in
the
narrative
the
procurators
a
name
that
we
give
to
the
men
who
collect
the
public
revenues
and
spend
what
is
ordered
he
sends
to
all
the
provinces
alike
his
own
and
the
people
and
some
of
these
officers
belong
to
the
knights
others
to
the
freedmen
by
way
of
exception
the
proconsuls
levy
the
tribute
upon
the
people
they
govern
the
emperor
gives
certain
injunctions
to
the
procurators
the
proconsuls
and
the
proprætors
in
order
that
they
may
proceed
to
their
place
of
office
on
fixed
conditions
both
this
practice
and
the
giving
of
salary
to
them
and
to
the
remaining
employees
of
the
government
were
made
the
custom
at
this
period
in
old
times
some
by
contracting
for
work
to
be
paid
for
from
the
public
treasury
furnished
themselves
with
everything
needed
for
their
office
it
was
only
in
the
days
of
cæsar
that
these
particular
persons
began
to
receive
something
definite
this
salary
was
not
assigned
to
all
of
them
in
equal
amounts
but
as
need
demands
the
procurators
get
their
very
name
a
dignified
one
from
the
amount
of
money
given
into
their
charge
the
following
laws
were
laid
down
for
all
alike
that
they
should
not
make
up
lists
for
service
or
levy
money
beyond
the
amount
appointed
unless
the
senate
should
so
vote
or
the
emperor
so
order
also
that
when
their
successors
should
arrive
they
were
immediately
to
leave
the
province
and
not
to
delay
on
their
return
but
to
be
back
within
three
months
these
matters
were
so
ordained
at
that
time
or
at
least
one
might
say
so
in
reality
cæsar
himself
was
destined
to
hold
absolute
control
of
all
of
them
for
all
time
because
he
commanded
the
soldiers
and
was
master
of
the
money
nominally
the
public
funds
had
been
separated
from
his
own
but
in
fact
he
spent
the
former
also
as
he
saw
fit
when
his
decade
had
come
to
an
end
there
was
voted
him
another
five
years
then
five
more
after
that
ten
and
again
another
ten
and
a
like
number
the
fifth
time
so
that
by
a
succession
of
periods
he
continued
monarch
for
life
consequently
the
subsequent
emperors
though
no
longer
appointed
for
a
specified
period
but
for
their
whole
life
at
once
nevertheless
have
been
wont
to
hold
a
festival
every
ten
years
as
if
then
renewing
their
sovereignty
once
more
this
is
done
even
at
the
present
day
cæsar
had
received
many
honors
previously
when
the
matter
of
declining
the
sovereignty
and
that
regarding
the
division
of
the
provinces
were
under
discussion
for
the
right
to
fasten
the
laurel
in
front
of
his
royal
residence
and
to
hang
the
crown
above
the
doors
was
then
voted
him
to
symbolize
the
fact
that
he
was
always
victorious
over
enemies
and
preserved
the
citizens
the
royal
building
is
called
palatium
not
because
it
was
ever
decreed
that
that
should
be
its
name
but
because
cæsar
dwelt
on
the
palatine
and
had
his
headquarters
there
and
his
house
secured
some
renown
from
the
mount
as
a
whole
by
reason
of
the
former
habitation
of
romulus
there
hence
even
if
the
emperor
resides
somewhere
else
his
dwelling
retains
the
name
of
palatium
when
he
had
really
completed
the
details
of
administration
the
name
augustus
was
finally
applied
to
him
by
the
senate
and
by
the
people
they
wanted
to
call
him
by
some
name
of
their
own
and
some
proposed
this
while
others
chose
that
cæsar
was
exceedingly
anxious
to
be
called
romulus
but
when
he
perceived
that
this
caused
him
to
be
suspected
of
desiring
the
kingship
he
no
longer
insisted
on
it
but
took
the
title
of
augustus
signifying
that
he
was
more
than
human
all
most
precious
and
sacred
objects
are
termed
therefore
they
saluted
him
also
in
greek
as
meaning
an
person
from
the
verb
in
this
way
all
the
power
of
the
people
and
that
of
the
senate
reverted
to
augustus
and
from
his
time
there
was
a
genuine
monarchy
monarchy
would
be
the
truest
name
for
it
no
matter
how
much
two
and
three
hold
the
power
together
this
name
of
monarch
the
romans
so
detested
that
they
called
their
emperors
neither
dictators
nor
kings
nor
anything
of
the
sort
yet
since
the
management
of
the
government
devolves
upon
them
it
can
not
but
be
that
they
are
kings
the
offices
that
commonly
enjoy
some
legal
sanction
are
even
now
maintained
except
that
of
censor
still
everything
is
directed
and
carried
out
precisely
as
the
emperor
at
the
time
may
wish
in
order
that
they
may
appear
to
hold
this
power
not
through
force
but
according
to
law
the
rulers
have
taken
possession
names
and
all
of
every
position
save
the
dictatorship
which
under
the
democracy
was
of
mighty
influence
among
the
citizens
who
bestowed
the
power
they
very
frequently
become
consuls
and
are
always
called
proconsuls
whenever
they
are
outside
the
pomerium
the
title
of
imperator
is
invariably
given
not
only
to
such
as
win
victories
but
to
all
the
rest
to
indicate
the
complete
independence
of
their
authority
instead
of
the
name
king
or
dictator
these
particular
names
they
have
never
assumed
since
the
terms
first
fell
out
of
use
in
the
senate
but
they
are
confirmed
in
the
prerogatives
of
these
positions
by
the
appellation
of
imperator
by
virtue
of
the
titles
mentioned
they
get
the
right
to
make
enrollments
to
collect
moneys
declare
wars
make
peace
rule
foreign
and
native
territory
alike
everywhere
and
always
even
to
the
extent
of
putting
to
death
both
knights
and
senators
within
the
pomerium
and
all
the
other
privileges
once
granted
to
the
consuls
and
other
officials
with
full
powers
by
virtue
of
the
office
of
censor
they
investigate
our
lives
and
characters
and
take
the
census
some
they
list
in
the
equestrian
and
senatorial
class
and
others
they
erase
from
the
roll
as
pleases
them
by
virtue
of
being
consecrated
in
all
the
priesthoods
and
furthermore
having
the
right
to
give
the
majority
of
them
to
others
and
from
the
fact
that
of
the
high
priests
if
there
be
two
or
three
holding
office
at
once
is
chosen
from
their
number
they
are
themselves
also
masters
of
holy
and
sacred
things
the
tribunician
authority
which
the
men
of
very
greatest
attainment
used
to
hold
gives
them
the
right
to
stop
any
measure
brought
up
by
some
one
else
in
case
they
do
not
join
in
approving
it
and
to
be
free
from
personal
abuse
moreover
if
they
are
thought
to
be
wronged
in
even
the
slightest
degree
not
merely
by
action
but
even
by
conversation
they
may
destroy
the
guilty
party
without
a
trial
as
one
polluted
they
do
not
think
it
lawful
to
be
tribune
because
they
belong
altogether
to
the
patrician
class
but
they
assume
all
the
power
of
the
tribuneship
undiminished
from
the
period
of
its
greatest
extent
and
thereby
the
enumeration
of
the
years
they
have
held
the
office
in
question
goes
forward
on
the
assumption
that
they
receive
it
year
by
year
along
with
the
others
who
are
successively
tribunes
thus
by
these
names
they
have
secured
these
privileges
in
accordance
with
all
the
various
usages
of
the
democracy
in
order
that
they
may
appear
to
possess
nothing
that
has
not
been
given
them
they
have
gained
also
another
prerogative
which
was
given
to
none
of
the
ancient
romans
outright
to
apply
to
all
cases
and
it
is
through
this
alone
that
it
would
be
possible
for
them
to
hold
the
above
offices
and
any
others
besides
they
are
freed
from
the
action
of
the
laws
as
the
very
words
in
latin
indicate
that
is
they
are
liberated
from
every
consideration
of
compulsion
and
are
subjected
to
none
of
the
written
ordinances
so
by
virtue
of
these
democratic
names
they
are
clothed
in
all
the
strength
of
the
government
and
have
all
that
appertains
to
kings
except
the
vulgar
title
cæsar
or
augustus
as
a
mode
of
address
confers
upon
them
no
distinct
privilege
of
its
own
but
shows
in
the
one
case
the
continuance
of
their
family
and
in
the
other
the
brilliance
and
dignity
of
their
position
the
salutation
father
perhaps
gives
them
a
certain
authority
over
us
which
fathers
once
had
over
their
children
it
was
not
used
however
for
this
purpose
in
the
beginning
but
for
their
honor
and
to
admonish
them
to
love
their
subjects
as
they
would
their
children
while
the
subjects
were
to
respect
them
as
they
respect
their
fathers
such
is
the
number
and
quality
of
the
titles
to
which
those
in
power
are
accustomed
according
to
the
and
according
to
what
has
now
become
tradition
at
present
all
of
them
are
as
a
rule
bestowed
upon
the
rulers
at
once
except
the
title
of
censor
to
the
earlier
emperors
they
were
voted
separately
and
from
time
to
time
some
of
the
emperors
took
the
censorship
in
accordance
with
ancient
custom
and
domitian
took
it
for
life
this
is
however
no
longer
done
at
the
present
day
they
possess
its
powers
and
are
not
chosen
for
it
and
do
not
employ
its
name
except
in
the
censuses
thus
was
the
constitution
made
over
at
that
time
for
the
better
and
in
a
way
to
provide
greater
security
it
was
doubtless
absolutely
impossible
for
the
people
to
be
preserved
under
a
democracy
events
after
this
however
can
not
be
said
to
be
similar
to
those
preceding
this
period
formerly
everything
was
referred
to
the
senate
and
the
people
even
if
it
occurred
at
a
distance
hence
all
learned
of
it
and
many
recorded
it
consequently
the
truth
of
happenings
no
matter
with
how
much
fear
and
gratitude
and
friendship
and
enmity
toward
any
one
they
were
related
has
been
found
at
least
in
the
works
of
those
who
wrote
of
them
and
to
a
certain
extent
also
in
the
public
records
but
after
this
time
business
began
to
be
transacted
more
often
with
concealment
and
secrecy
nowadays
even
if
anything
is
made
public
it
is
distrusted
because
it
can
not
be
proved
it
is
suspected
that
all
speeches
and
acts
are
to
meet
the
wishes
of
the
men
at
the
time
in
power
and
of
their
associates
as
a
result
much
that
never
occurs
is
noised
abroad
and
much
that
really
happens
is
unknown
nearly
everything
is
reported
in
a
different
form
from
what
really
takes
place
yet
the
magnitude
of
the
empire
and
the
number
of
events
render
accuracy
in
regard
to
them
most
difficult
in
rome
there
are
many
operations
going
on
and
so
in
its
subject
territory
as
well
as
against
hostile
tribes
always
and
every
day
so
to
speak
clear
information
about
which
no
one
can
easily
get
except
those
actively
concerned
there
are
great
numbers
who
do
not
hear
at
all
of
what
has
taken
place
hence
all
that
follows
which
will
require
mention
i
shall
narrate
as
it
has
been
published
whether
it
is
so
in
truth
or
is
really
somewhat
different
in
addition
however
my
own
opinion
so
far
as
possible
will
be
stated
in
matters
where
i
have
been
able
to
deduce
something
else
than
the
common
report
from
the
many
things
i
have
read
or
heard
or
seen
cæsar
as
i
have
said
received
the
further
designation
of
augustus
and
a
sign
of
no
little
moment
in
regard
to
him
occurred
that
very
night
the
tiber
overflowed
and
occupied
all
of
rome
that
was
built
in
the
plain
country
so
that
it
was
submerged
from
this
the
soothsayers
inferred
that
he
would
rise
to
great
heights
and
keep
the
whole
city
subservient
while
different
persons
were
rivals
to
show
him
excessive
honors
one
sextus
pacuvius
or
as
others
say
apudius
surpassed
them
all
in
the
open
senate
he
consecrated
himself
to
him
after
the
fashion
of
the
spaniards
and
advised
the
rest
to
do
the
same
when
augustus
hindered
him
he
rushed
out
to
the
crowd
standing
near
by
and
as
he
was
tribune
compelled
them
and
next
all
the
rest
who
were
wandering
about
through
the
streets
and
lanes
to
consecrate
themselves
to
augustus
from
this
episode
we
are
wont
even
now
to
say
in
appeals
to
the
sovereign
we
have
consecrated
ourselves
to
you
pacuvius
ordered
all
to
offer
sacrifice
for
this
occurrence
and
before
the
people
he
once
said
he
should
make
augustus
his
inheritor
on
equal
terms
with
his
son
this
was
not
because
he
possessed
anything
much
but
because
he
wished
to
get
more
and
his
desire
was
accomplished
augustus
attended
with
considerable
zeal
to
all
the
business
of
the
empire
to
make
it
appear
that
he
had
received
it
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
all
and
he
also
enacted
many
laws
i
need
not
go
into
each
one
of
them
in
detail
except
those
which
have
a
bearing
upon
my
history
this
same
course
i
shall
follow
in
the
case
of
later
events
in
order
not
to
become
wearisome
by
introducing
all
such
matters
as
not
even
those
who
specialize
on
them
most
narrowly
know
with
accuracy
not
all
of
these
laws
were
enacted
on
his
sole
responsibility
some
of
them
he
brought
before
the
public
in
advance
in
order
that
if
any
featured
caused
displeasure
he
might
learn
it
in
time
and
correct
them
he
urged
that
any
one
at
all
give
him
advice
if
any
one
could
think
of
anything
better
he
accorded
them
full
liberty
of
speech
and
some
provisions
he
actually
did
alter
most
important
of
all
he
took
as
advisers
for
six
months
the
consuls
or
the
consul
when
he
himself
also
held
the
office
one
of
each
of
the
other
kinds
of
officials
and
fifteen
men
chosen
by
lot
from
the
remainder
of
the
senatorial
body
through
them
he
was
accustomed
to
a
certain
extent
to
communicate
to
all
the
rest
the
provisions
of
his
laws
some
features
he
brought
before
the
entire
senate
he
deemed
it
better
however
to
consider
most
of
the
laws
and
the
greater
ones
in
company
with
a
few
persons
at
leisure
and
acted
accordingly
sometimes
he
tried
cases
with
their
assistance
the
entire
senate
by
itself
sat
in
judgment
as
formerly
and
transacted
business
with
occasional
groups
of
envoys
and
heralds
from
both
peoples
and
kings
furthermore
the
people
and
the
plebs
came
together
for
the
elections
but
nothing
was
done
that
would
not
please
cæsar
some
of
those
who
were
to
hold
office
he
himself
chose
out
and
nominated
and
others
he
put
according
to
ancient
custom
in
the
power
of
the
people
and
the
plebs
yet
taking
care
that
no
unfit
persons
should
be
appointed
nor
by
factious
cliques
nor
by
bribery
in
this
way
he
controlled
the
entire
empire
i
shall
relate
also
in
detail
all
his
acts
that
need
mentioning
together
with
the
names
of
the
consuls
under
whom
they
were
performed
in
the
year
previously
named
seeing
that
the
roads
outside
the
wall
had
become
through
neglect
hard
to
traverse
he
ordered
different
senators
to
repair
different
ones
at
their
own
expense
he
himself
attended
to
the
flaminian
way
since
he
was
going
to
lead
an
army
out
by
that
route
this
operation
was
finished
forthwith
and
images
of
him
were
accordingly
erected
on
arches
on
the
bridge
over
the
tiber
and
at
ariminum
the
other
roads
were
repaired
later
either
at
public
expense
for
none
of
the
senators
liked
to
spend
money
on
it
or
by
augustus
as
one
may
wish
to
state
i
can
not
distinguish
their
treasures
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
augustus
coined
into
money
some
silver
statues
of
himself
made
by
his
friends
and
by
certain
of
the
tribes
purposing
thereby
to
make
it
appear
that
all
the
expenditures
which
he
said
he
made
were
from
his
own
means
therefore
i
have
no
opinion
to
record
as
to
whether
a
ruler
at
any
particular
time
took
money
from
the
public
treasury
or
whether
he
ever
gave
it
himself
for
both
of
these
things
were
often
done
why
should
any
one
list
such
things
as
either
expenditures
or
donations
when
the
people
and
the
emperor
are
constantly
making
both
the
one
and
the
other
in
common
these
were
the
acts
of
augustus
at
that
time
he
also
set
out
apparently
to
make
a
campaign
into
britain
but
on
coming
to
the
provinces
of
gaul
lingered
there
for
the
britons
seemed
likely
to
make
terms
with
him
and
gallic
affairs
were
still
unsettled
as
the
civil
wars
had
begun
immediately
after
their
subjugation
he
made
a
census
of
the
people
and
set
in
order
their
life
and
government
u
from
there
he
came
to
spain
and
reduced
that
country
also
to
quiet
after
this
he
became
consul
for
the
eighth
time
with
statilius
taurus
and
agrippa
dedicated
the
for
he
had
not
promised
to
repair
any
road
this
edifice
in
the
campus
martius
had
been
constructed
by
lepidus
by
the
addition
of
porticos
all
about
for
the
tribal
elections
and
agrippa
adorned
it
with
stone
tablets
and
paintings
naming
it
julian
from
augustus
the
builder
incurred
no
jealousy
for
it
but
was
greatly
honored
both
by
augustus
himself
and
by
all
the
rest
of
the
people
the
reason
is
that
he
gave
his
master
the
most
kindly
the
most
distinguished
the
most
beneficial
advice
and
coöperation
yet
claimed
not
even
a
small
share
of
the
consequent
glory
he
used
the
honors
which
cæsar
gave
not
for
personal
gain
or
enjoyment
but
for
the
benefit
of
the
giver
himself
and
of
the
on
the
other
hand
cornelius
gallus
was
led
to
insolent
behavior
by
honor
he
talked
a
great
deal
of
idle
nonsense
against
augustus
and
was
guilty
of
many
sly
reprehensible
actions
throughout
nearly
all
egypt
he
set
up
images
of
himself
and
he
inscribed
upon
the
pyramids
a
list
of
his
achievements
for
this
he
was
accused
by
valerius
largus
his
comrade
and
intimate
and
was
disenfranchised
by
augustus
so
that
he
was
prevented
from
living
in
the
emperor
provinces
after
this
took
place
others
attacked
him
and
brought
many
indictments
against
him
the
senate
unanimously
voted
that
he
should
be
convicted
in
the
courts
be
deprived
of
his
property
and
be
exiled
that
his
possessions
be
given
to
augustus
and
that
they
should
sacrifice
oxen
in
overwhelming
grief
at
this
gallus
committed
suicide
before
the
decrees
took
effect
the
false
behavior
of
most
men
was
evidenced
by
this
fact
that
they
now
treated
the
man
whom
they
once
used
to
flatter
in
such
a
way
that
they
forced
him
to
die
by
his
own
hand
to
largus
they
showed
devotion
because
his
star
was
beginning
to
rise
though
they
were
sure
to
vote
the
same
measures
against
him
if
anything
similar
should
ever
occur
in
his
case
proculeius
however
felt
so
toward
him
that
on
meeting
him
once
he
clapped
his
hand
over
his
nose
and
his
mouth
thereby
signifying
to
the
bystanders
that
it
was
not
safe
even
to
breathe
in
the
man
presence
another
person
although
unknown
approached
him
with
witnesses
and
asked
if
largus
recognized
him
when
the
one
questioned
said
no
he
recorded
his
denial
on
a
tablet
thus
making
it
beyond
the
power
of
the
rascal
to
inform
against
a
person
at
least
whom
he
had
not
previously
known
thus
we
see
that
most
men
emulate
the
exploits
of
others
though
they
be
evil
instead
of
guarding
against
their
fate
so
also
at
this
time
there
was
marcus
egnatius
rufus
who
had
been
an
ædile
the
majority
of
his
deeds
had
been
good
and
with
his
own
slaves
and
with
some
others
that
were
hired
he
lent
aid
to
the
houses
that
took
fire
during
his
year
of
office
in
return
he
received
from
the
people
the
expenses
incurred
in
his
position
and
by
a
suspension
of
the
law
was
made
prætor
elated
at
these
marks
of
favor
he
despised
augustus
so
much
as
to
record
that
he
rufus
had
delivered
the
city
unimpaired
and
entire
to
his
successor
all
the
foremost
men
and
augustus
himself
most
of
all
became
indignant
at
this
he
prepared
therefore
to
teach
the
upstart
a
lesson
in
the
near
future
not
to
exalt
his
mind
above
the
mass
of
men
for
the
time
being
he
issued
an
edict
to
the
ædiles
to
see
to
it
that
no
building
took
fire
and
if
aught
of
the
kind
did
happen
to
extinguish
the
blaze
in
this
same
year
also
polemon
who
was
king
of
pontus
was
enrolled
among
the
friends
and
allies
of
the
roman
people
front
seats
for
the
senators
were
provided
in
all
the
theatres
of
the
emperor
whole
domain
augustus
finding
that
the
britons
would
not
come
to
terms
wished
to
make
an
expedition
into
their
country
but
was
detained
by
the
salassi
who
had
revolted
against
him
and
by
the
cantabri
and
astures
who
had
been
made
hostile
the
former
dwell
close
under
the
alps
as
has
been
herein
stated
whereas
both
of
the
latter
tribes
hold
the
strongest
region
of
the
pyrenees
on
the
spanish
side
and
the
plain
which
is
below
it
for
these
reasons
augustus
now
in
his
ninth
consulship
with
marcus
silanus
sent
terentius
varro
against
the
salassi
the
latter
invaded
their
territory
at
many
points
at
once
in
order
that
they
might
not
unite
and
become
harder
to
subdue
and
had
a
very
easy
time
in
conquering
them
because
they
attacked
him
only
in
small
groups
having
forced
them
to
capitulate
he
demanded
a
fixed
sum
of
money
allowing
it
to
be
supposed
that
he
would
impose
no
other
punishment
after
that
he
sent
soldiers
everywhere
apparently
to
attend
to
the
collection
of
the
indemnity
and
arrested
those
of
military
age
whom
he
sold
under
an
agreement
that
none
of
them
should
be
liberated
within
twenty
years
the
best
of
their
land
was
given
to
members
of
the
pretorians
and
came
to
include
a
city
called
augusta
prætoria
augustus
himself
waged
war
upon
the
astures
and
upon
the
cantabri
at
the
same
time
these
refused
to
yield
because
of
confidence
in
their
position
on
the
heights
and
would
not
come
to
close
quarters
owing
to
their
inferior
numbers
and
the
fact
that
most
of
them
were
javelin
throwers
but
they
caused
him
much
trouble
whenever
he
made
any
movement
by
always
seizing
the
higher
ground
in
advance
and
placing
ambuscades
in
depressions
and
in
wooded
spots
he
found
himself
therefore
quite
unable
to
cope
with
the
difficulty
and
having
fallen
ill
from
weariness
and
worry
retired
to
tarraco
and
there
remained
sick
meantime
gaius
antistius
fought
against
them
accomplishing
considerable
not
because
he
was
a
better
general
than
augustus
but
because
the
barbarians
felt
contempt
for
him
and
thus
joined
battle
with
the
romans
and
were
defeated
in
this
way
he
captured
some
points
and
afterward
titus
carisius
took
lancia
the
principal
fortress
of
the
astures
which
had
been
abandoned
and
won
to
his
side
many
towns
at
the
conclusion
of
this
war
augustus
dismissed
the
more
aged
of
his
soldiers
and
gave
them
a
city
to
settle
in
lusitania
the
augusta
emerita
for
those
who
were
still
of
the
military
age
he
arranged
some
spectacles
right
among
the
legions
through
the
agency
of
tiberius
and
marcellus
as
ædiles
to
juba
he
gave
portions
of
gætulia
in
return
for
the
prince
ancestral
domain
for
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
had
been
enrolled
as
members
of
the
roman
polity
and
also
the
possessions
of
bocchus
and
bogud
on
the
death
of
amyntas
he
did
not
entrust
the
country
to
the
children
of
the
deceased
but
made
it
a
part
of
the
subject
territory
thus
gaul
together
with
lycaonia
obtained
a
roman
governor
the
regions
of
pamphylia
formerly
assigned
to
amyntas
were
restored
to
their
own
about
this
same
time
marcus
vinicius
in
making
reprisals
against
the
celtæ
because
they
had
arrested
and
destroyed
romans
who
had
entered
their
country
to
have
friendly
dealings
with
them
himself
gave
the
name
of
imperator
to
augustus
for
this
and
for
the
other
achievements
of
the
time
a
triumph
was
voted
to
cæsar
but
as
he
did
not
care
to
celebrate
it
an
arch
bearing
a
trophy
was
constructed
in
the
alps
for
his
glory
and
authority
was
given
him
to
wear
always
on
the
first
day
of
the
year
both
the
crown
and
the
triumphal
garb
after
these
successes
in
the
wars
augustus
closed
the
precinct
of
janus
which
had
been
opened
because
of
the
strife
meanwhile
agrippa
had
been
beautifying
the
city
at
his
own
expense
first
in
honor
of
the
naval
victories
he
built
over
the
of
and
lent
it
further
brilliance
by
the
painting
of
the
argonauts
secondly
he
repaired
the
laconian
sudatorium
he
gave
the
name
laconian
to
the
gymnasium
because
the
lacedæmonians
had
in
those
days
a
greater
reputation
than
anybody
else
for
stripping
naked
and
exercising
smeared
with
oil
also
he
completed
the
it
has
this
name
perhaps
because
it
received
the
images
of
many
gods
and
among
them
the
statues
of
mars
and
venus
but
my
own
opinion
is
that
the
name
is
due
to
its
round
shape
like
the
sky
agrippa
desired
to
place
augustus
also
there
and
to
take
the
designation
of
the
structure
from
his
title
but
as
his
master
would
not
accept
either
honor
he
placed
in
the
temple
itself
a
statue
of
the
former
cæsar
and
in
the
anteroom
representations
of
augustus
and
himself
this
was
done
not
from
any
rivalry
and
ambition
on
agrippa
part
to
make
himself
equal
to
augustus
but
from
his
superabundant
devotion
to
him
and
his
perpetual
affection
for
the
commonwealth
hence
augustus
so
far
from
censuring
him
for
it
honored
him
the
more
for
being
unable
through
sickness
to
superintend
at
that
time
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
julia
and
his
nephew
marcellus
he
commissioned
agrippa
to
hold
the
festival
in
his
absence
and
when
the
house
on
the
palatine
hill
which
had
formerly
been
antony
but
was
later
given
to
agrippa
and
messala
was
burned
down
he
made
a
grant
of
money
to
messala
and
gave
agrippa
equal
rights
of
domicile
the
latter
not
unnaturally
gained
high
distinction
as
a
result
of
this
and
one
gaius
toranius
also
acquired
a
good
reputation
because
while
tribune
he
brought
his
father
though
some
one
freedman
into
the
theatre
and
made
him
sit
beside
him
upon
the
tribune
bench
publius
servilius
too
made
a
name
for
himself
because
while
prætor
he
caused
to
be
killed
at
a
festival
three
hundred
bears
and
other
libyan
wild
beasts
equal
in
number
augustus
now
entered
upon
office
for
the
tenth
time
with
gaius
norbanus
and
on
the
first
day
of
the
month
the
senate
took
oaths
confirming
his
deeds
when
he
was
announced
as
drawing
near
the
city
his
sickness
had
delayed
him
he
promised
to
give
the
people
a
hundred
denarii
each
and
issued
instructions
that
the
document
concerning
the
money
should
not
be
bulletined
until
the
senate
also
should
approve
they
had
freed
him
from
all
compulsion
of
the
laws
to
the
end
as
i
have
stated
that
being
really
independent
and
possessed
of
full
powers
over
both
himself
and
the
laws
he
should
follow
all
of
them
that
he
wished
and
not
follow
any
that
he
did
not
wish
this
right
was
voted
to
him
while
still
absent
on
his
arrival
in
rome
there
were
various
events
in
honor
of
his
preservation
and
return
and
marcellus
was
accorded
the
right
to
be
a
senator
of
the
class
of
and
to
be
a
candidate
for
the
consulship
ten
years
earlier
than
was
customary
tiberius
was
permitted
in
a
similar
fashion
to
be
a
candidate
five
years
before
the
age
set
for
each
office
the
latter
was
at
once
appointed
quæstor
and
the
former
ædile
as
the
quæstors
needed
to
serve
in
the
provinces
were
proving
insufficient
all
drew
lots
for
the
places
who
for
ten
years
previous
had
been
named
quæstors
without
the
duties
of
the
office
these
then
were
the
occurrences
in
the
city
worthy
of
note
that
year
as
soon
as
augustus
had
departed
from
spain
leaving
behind
lucius
æmilius
as
governor
of
it
the
cantabri
and
astures
made
an
uprising
they
sent
to
æmilius
before
anything
about
it
became
known
to
him
and
said
they
wished
to
give
the
army
grain
and
some
other
presents
then
having
secured
a
number
of
soldiers
who
were
presumably
to
carry
the
supplies
they
led
them
to
suitable
places
and
butchered
them
their
pleasure
however
did
not
last
long
when
their
country
had
been
devastated
and
some
forts
burned
and
chiefest
of
all
the
hands
of
every
one
that
was
caught
were
cut
off
they
were
quickly
subdued
while
this
was
going
on
another
new
campaign
had
its
beginning
and
end
it
was
led
by
ælius
gallus
governor
of
egypt
against
the
of
which
sabos
was
king
at
first
he
encountered
no
one
at
all
yet
did
not
proceed
without
effort
the
desert
the
sun
and
the
water
which
had
some
peculiar
nature
distressed
them
greatly
so
that
the
majority
of
the
army
perished
the
disease
proved
to
be
dissimilar
to
any
ordinary
complaint
and
fell
upon
the
head
which
it
caused
to
wither
this
killed
most
of
them
at
once
but
in
the
case
of
the
survivors
it
descended
to
the
legs
skipping
all
the
intervening
parts
of
the
body
and
wrought
injury
to
them
there
was
no
remedy
for
it
except
by
both
drinking
and
rubbing
on
olive
oil
mixed
with
wine
this
was
in
the
power
of
only
a
few
of
them
to
do
for
the
country
produces
neither
of
these
articles
and
the
men
had
not
provided
a
large
supply
of
them
beforehand
in
the
midst
of
this
trouble
the
barbarians
also
fell
upon
them
for
a
while
the
enemy
were
defeated
whenever
they
joined
battle
and
lost
some
places
later
however
with
the
disease
as
an
ally
they
won
back
their
own
possessions
and
drove
the
survivors
of
the
expedition
out
of
the
country
these
were
the
first
of
the
romans
and
i
think
the
only
ones
who
traversed
so
much
of
this
part
of
arabia
in
warfare
they
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
athlula
a
famous
locality
augustus
was
for
the
eleventh
time
consul
with
calpurnius
piso
when
he
fell
so
sick
once
more
as
to
have
no
hope
of
saving
his
life
he
accordingly
arranged
everything
in
the
idea
that
he
was
about
to
die
and
gathering
about
him
the
officials
and
the
other
foremost
senators
and
knights
he
appointed
no
successor
though
they
were
expecting
that
marcellus
would
be
preferred
before
all
for
the
position
after
conversing
briefly
with
them
about
public
matters
he
gave
piso
the
list
of
the
forces
and
the
public
revenues
written
in
a
book
and
handed
his
ring
to
agrippa
the
emperor
became
unable
to
do
even
the
very
simplest
things
yet
a
certain
antonius
musas
managed
to
restore
him
to
health
by
means
of
cold
baths
and
cold
drinks
for
this
he
received
a
great
deal
of
money
from
both
augustus
and
the
senate
as
well
as
the
right
to
wear
gold
rings
he
was
a
freedman
and
secured
exemption
from
taxes
for
both
himself
and
the
members
of
his
profession
not
only
those
then
living
but
also
those
of
coming
generations
but
he
who
assumed
the
powers
of
fortune
and
fate
was
destined
soon
after
to
be
well
worsted
augustus
had
been
saved
in
this
manner
but
marcellus
falling
sick
not
much
later
was
treated
in
the
same
way
by
musas
and
died
augustus
gave
him
a
public
burial
with
the
usual
eulogies
placed
him
in
the
monument
which
was
being
built
and
honored
his
memory
by
calling
the
theatre
the
foundations
of
which
had
already
been
laid
by
the
former
cæsar
the
theatre
of
marcellus
he
ordered
also
that
a
gold
image
of
the
deceased
a
golden
crown
and
his
chair
of
office
be
carried
into
the
theatre
at
the
ludi
romani
and
be
placed
in
the
midst
of
the
officials
having
charge
of
the
function
this
he
did
later
after
being
restored
to
health
on
this
occasion
he
brought
his
will
into
the
senate
and
wished
to
read
it
by
way
of
showing
people
that
he
had
left
no
successor
to
his
position
he
did
not
however
read
it
for
no
one
would
permit
that
quite
every
one
however
was
astonished
at
him
in
that
since
he
loved
marcellus
as
and
nephew
yet
he
failed
to
trust
him
with
the
monarchy
but
preferred
agrippa
before
him
his
regard
for
marcellus
had
been
shown
by
many
honors
among
them
his
lending
aid
in
carrying
out
the
festival
which
the
young
man
gave
as
ædile
the
brilliance
of
this
occasion
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
in
midsummer
he
sheltered
the
forum
by
curtains
overhead
and
introduced
a
knight
and
a
woman
of
note
as
dancers
in
the
orchestra
but
his
final
attitude
seemed
to
show
that
he
was
not
yet
confident
of
the
judgment
and
that
he
either
wanted
the
people
to
get
back
their
liberty
or
agrippa
to
receive
the
leadership
from
them
he
understood
well
that
agrippa
and
the
people
were
on
the
best
of
terms
and
he
was
unwilling
to
appear
to
be
delivering
the
supreme
power
with
his
own
hands
when
he
recovered
therefore
and
learned
that
marcellus
on
this
account
was
not
friendly
toward
agrippa
he
immediately
despatched
the
latter
to
syria
so
that
no
delay
and
desultory
dispute
might
arise
by
their
being
in
the
same
place
agrippa
forthwith
started
from
the
city
but
did
not
make
his
way
to
syria
but
proceeding
even
more
moderately
than
usual
he
sent
his
lieutenants
there
and
himself
lingered
in
lesbos
besides
doing
this
augustus
appointed
ten
prætors
feeling
that
he
did
not
require
any
more
this
number
remained
constant
for
several
years
some
of
them
were
intended
to
fulfill
the
same
duties
as
of
yore
and
two
of
them
to
have
charge
of
the
administration
of
the
finances
each
year
having
settled
these
details
he
resigned
the
consulship
and
went
to
albanum
he
himself
ever
since
the
constitution
had
been
arranged
had
held
office
for
the
entire
year
as
had
most
of
his
colleagues
and
he
wished
now
to
interrupt
this
custom
again
in
order
that
as
many
as
possible
might
be
consuls
his
resignation
took
place
outside
the
city
to
prevent
his
being
hindered
in
his
purpose
for
this
act
he
received
praise
as
also
because
he
chose
to
take
his
place
lucius
sestius
who
had
always
been
an
enthusiastic
follower
of
brutus
had
campaigned
with
the
latter
in
all
his
wars
and
even
at
this
time
made
mention
of
him
had
his
images
and
delivered
eulogies
so
far
from
disliking
the
friendly
and
faithful
qualities
of
the
man
the
emperor
even
honored
him
the
senate
consequently
voted
that
augustus
be
tribune
for
life
and
that
he
might
bring
forward
at
each
meeting
of
the
senate
any
business
he
liked
concerning
any
one
matter
even
if
he
should
not
be
consul
at
the
time
and
allowed
him
to
hold
the
office
of
proconsul
once
for
all
perpetually
so
that
he
had
neither
to
lay
it
down
on
entering
the
pomerium
nor
to
take
it
up
again
outside
the
body
also
granted
him
more
power
in
subject
territory
than
the
several
governors
possessed
as
a
result
both
he
and
subsequent
emperors
gained
a
certain
legal
right
to
the
use
of
the
tribunican
authority
in
addition
to
their
other
powers
but
the
actual
name
of
tribune
neither
augustus
nor
any
other
emperor
has
held
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
then
acquired
these
rights
as
described
not
from
flattery
but
as
a
mark
of
real
honor
in
most
ways
he
behaved
toward
the
romans
as
if
they
were
free
citizens
for
when
tiridates
in
person
and
envoys
from
phraates
arrived
to
settle
their
mutual
disputes
he
introduced
them
to
the
senate
after
this
when
the
decision
of
the
question
had
been
entrusted
to
him
by
that
body
he
refused
to
surrender
tiridates
to
phraates
but
sent
back
to
him
his
son
whom
tiridates
had
formerly
received
from
the
other
and
was
keeping
on
condition
that
the
captives
and
the
military
standards
taken
in
the
disasters
of
crassus
and
of
antony
be
returned
in
this
same
year
one
of
the
inferior
ædiles
died
and
gaius
calpurnius
succeeded
him
in
spite
of
having
served
previously
as
one
of
the
patrician
ædiles
this
is
not
mentioned
as
having
occurred
in
the
case
of
any
other
man
during
the
feriæ
there
were
two
præfecti
urbi
each
day
and
one
of
them
who
was
not
yet
admitted
to
the
standing
of
a
youth
nevertheless
held
office
livia
however
was
accused
of
having
caused
the
death
of
marcellus
because
he
had
been
preferred
before
her
sons
this
suspicion
became
a
matter
of
controversy
both
in
that
year
and
in
the
following
which
proved
so
unhealthful
that
great
numbers
perished
during
its
progress
and
as
it
usually
happens
that
some
sign
occurs
before
such
events
so
on
this
occasion
a
wolf
had
been
caught
in
the
city
fire
and
storm
damaged
many
buildings
and
the
tiber
rising
washed
away
the
wooden
bridge
and
rendered
the
city
submerged
for
three
days

the

caused

flood
which
submerged

among
them
the
statues
in
the

and
the
spear
even
fell
from
the
hand
of
augustus
the
pestilence
raged
throughout
italy
so
that
no
one
tilled
the
land
and
i
think
that
the
same
was
the
case
in
foreign
parts
the
romans
therefore
reduced
to
dire
straits
by
disease
and
by
famine
thought
that
this
had
happened
to
them
for
no
other
reason
than
that
they
did
not
have
augustus
for
consul
this
time
also
they
accordingly
wished
to
elect
him
as
dictator
and
shutting
the
senate
up
within
its
halls
they
forced
it
to
vote
this
measure
by
threatening
to
burn
down
the
building
next
they
took
the
rods
and
accosted
augustus
begging
him
both
to
be
named
dictator
and
to
become
commissioner
of
grain
as
pompey
had
once
been
he
accepted
the
latter
duty
under
compulsion
and
ordered
two
men
from
among
those
who
had
served
as
prætors
five
years
or
more
previously
in
every
instance
to
be
chosen
annually
to
attend
to
the
distribution
of
grain
as
for
the
dictatorship
however
he
would
not
hear
of
it
and
went
so
far
as
to
rend
his
clothing
when
he
found
himself
unable
to
restrain
them
in
any
other
way
either
by
reasoning
or
by
prayer
as
he
already
had
authority
and
honor
even
beyond
that
of
dictators
he
did
right
to
guard
against
the
jealousy
and
hatred
which
the
title
would
arouse
his
course
was
the
same
when
they
wished
to
elect
him
censor
for
life
without
entering
upon
the
office
himself
he
immediately
designated
others
as
censors
namely
paulus
æmilius
lepidus
and
lucius
munatius
plancus
the
latter
a
brother
of
that
plancus
who
had
been
proscribed
and
the
former
a
person
who
at
that
time
had
himself
been
under
sentence
of
death
these
were
the
last
private
citizens
to
hold
the
appointment
as
was
at
once
made
manifest
by
the
men
themselves
the
platform
on
which
they
were
intended
to
perform
the
ceremonies
pertaining
to
their
position
fell
to
the
ground
in
pieces
when
they
had
ascended
it
on
the
first
day
of
their
office
after
that
there
were
no
other
censors
appointed
together
as
they
had
been
even
at
this
time
augustus
in
spite
of
their
having
been
chosen
took
care
of
many
matters
which
properly
belonged
to
them
of
the
public
messes
he
abolished
some
altogether
and
reformed
others
so
that
greater
temperance
prevailed
he
committed
the
charge
of
all
the
festivals
to
the
prætors
commanding
that
an
appropriation
be
given
them
from
the
public
treasury
moreover
he
forbade
them
to
spend
from
their
own
means
on
these
occasions
more
than
they
received
from
the
other
source
or
to
have
armed
combat
under
any
other
conditions
than
if
the
senate
should
vote
for
it
and
even
then
there
were
to
be
not
more
than
two
such
contests
in
each
year
and
they
should
consist
of
not
more
than
one
hundred
and
twenty
men
to
the
curule
ædiles
he
entrusted
the
extinguishment
of
conflagrations
for
which
purpose
he
granted
them
six
hundred
slave
assistants
and
since
knights
and
women
of
note
had
thus
early
appeared
in
the
orchestra
he
forbade
not
only
the
children
of
senators
to
whom
the
prohibition
had
even
previously
extended
but
also
their
grandchildren
who
naturally
found
a
place
in
the
equestrian
class
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
again
in
these
ordinances
he
let
both
the
substance
and
the
name
of
the
lawgiver
and
emperor
be
seen
in
other
matters
he
was
more
moderate
and
even
came
to
the
aid
of
some
of
his
friends
when
their
conduct
was
subjected
to
official
scrutiny
but
a
certain
marcus
primus
was
accused
of
having
made
war
upon
the
odrysae
while
he
was
governor
of
macedonia
who
said
at
one
time
that
he
had
done
it
with
the
approval
of
augustus
and
again
with
that
of
marcellus
the
emperor
thereupon
came
of
his
own
accord
into
the
court
and
when
interrogated
by
the
prætors
as
to
whether
he
had
instructed
the
man
to
make
war
entered
a
denial
the
advocate
of
primus
licinius
murena
in
the
course
of
some
rather
disrespectful
remarks
that
he
made
to
him
enquired
what
are
you
doing
here
and
who
summoned
you
to
this
augustus
only
replied
the
public
good
for
this
he
received
praise
from
sensible
persons
and
was
even
given
the
right
to
convene
the
senate
as
often
as
he
pleased
some
of
the
others
looked
down
upon
him
indeed
not
a
few
voted
for
the
acquittal
of
primus
and
others
united
to
form
a
plot
against
cæsar
fannius
cæpio
was
at
the
head
of
it
though
others
had
a
share
murena
also
was
said
whether
truly
or
by
way
of
calumny
to
have
been
one
of
the
conspirators
since
he
was
insatiate
and
unsparing
in
his
outspokenness
to
all
alike
these
men
did
not
appear
for
trial
in
court
but
were
convicted
by
default
on
the
supposition
that
they
intended
to
flee
shortly
after
however
they
were
put
to
death
murena
found
neither
his
brother
proculeius
nor
mæcenas
his
husband
of
any
avail
though
they
were
the
recipients
of
distinguished
honors
from
augustus
and
as
some
of
the
jurymen
actually
voted
to
acquit
these
conspirators
the
emperor
made
a
law
that
votes
should
not
be
cast
secretly
in
cases
by
default
and
that
the
persons
on
trial
must
receive
a
unanimous
conviction
that
he
authorized
these
provisions
not
in
anger
but
as
really
conducive
to
the
public
good
he
gave
overwhelming
evidence
cæpio
father
liberated
one
of
his
slaves
who
had
accompanied
his
son
on
his
flight
because
he
had
wished
to
defend
the
younger
man
when
he
met
his
death
but
a
second
slave
who
had
betrayed
him
the
father
led
through
the
middle
of
the
forum
with
an
inscription
making
known
the
reason
why
he
should
be
killed
and
after
that
crucified
him
yet
at
all
this
the
emperor
showed
no
indignation
he
would
have
allayed
all
the
criticism
of
those
not
pleased
with
the
course
of
events
had
he
not
allowed
sacrifices
as
for
some
victory
to
be
both
voted
and
offered
it
was
at
this
period
that
he
restored
both
cyprus
and
gallia
narbonensis
to
the
people
as
provinces
no
longer
needing
his
administration
of
martial
law
thus
proconsuls
began
to
be
sent
to
these
places
also
he
also
dedicated
the
temple
of
jupiter
tonans
concerning
which
event
these
two
traditions
survive
that
at
the
time
thunder
occurred
during
the
ritual
and
that
later
augustus
had
a
dream
which
i
shall
proceed
to
describe
he
thought
that
the
throng
had
come
to
do
reverence
to
the
deity
partly
attracted
by
the
novelty
of
his
name
and
form
and
partly
because
he
had
been
put
in
place
by
augustus
but
chiefest
of
all
because
they
encountered
him
first
when
they
ascended
the
capitol
and
he
dreamed
that
jupiter
in
the
great
temple
was
angry
because
he
was
now
reduced
to
second
place
and
that
he
himself
thereupon
said
to
the
offended
god
as
he
reported
the
story
that
he
had
tonans
as
an
advance
guard
when
it
became
day
he
attached
a
bell
to
the
statue
by
way
of
confirming
the
vision
for
those
who
guard
apartment
houses
by
night
carry
a
bell
in
order
to
be
able
to
signal
the
inhabitants
whenever
they
these
events
then
took
place
at
rome
about
this
same
period
the
cantabri
and
the
astures
broke
out
into
war
again
the
action
of
the
astures
was
due
to
the
haughtiness
and
cruelty
of
carisius
the
cantabri
on
the
other
hand
took
the
field
because
they
learned
that
the
other
tribe
was
in
revolt
and
because
they
despised
their
governor
gaius
furnius
since
he
had
but
lately
arrived
and
they
conceived
him
to
be
unacquainted
with
conditions
in
their
territory
he
did
not
however
show
himself
that
sort
of
man
in
action
for
both
tribes
were
defeated
and
reduced
to
slavery
by
him
carisius
even
receiving
help
from
him
not
many
of
the
cantabri
were
captured
as
they
had
no
hope
of
freedom
they
did
not
choose
to
live
but
some
after
setting
the
forts
on
fire
stabbed
themselves
and
others
let
themselves
be
consumed
with
the
works
while
still
others
in
the
sight
of
all
took
poison
thus
the
most
of
them
and
the
fiercest
faction
perished
as
for
the
astures
as
soon
as
they
had
been
repulsed
in
a
siege
at
some
point
and
had
subsequently
been
beaten
in
battle
they
made
no
further
resistance
but
were
straightway
subdued
about
this
same
time
the
ethiopians
who
dwell
beyond
egypt
advanced
as
far
as
the
city
called
elephantine
with
candace
as
their
leader
ravaging
the
whole
region
that
they
traversed
on
learning
that
gaius
petronius
the
governor
of
egypt
was
approaching
and
somewhere
near
they
hastily
retreated
hoping
to
make
good
their
escape
overtaken
on
the
road
however
they
suffered
defeat
and
then
drew
him
on
into
their
own
country
there
too
he
contended
nobly
and
took
among
other
cities
napata
the
royal
residence
of
that
tribe
this
town
was
razed
to
the
ground
and
a
garrison
left
at
another
post
for
petronius
not
being
able
to
advance
farther
on
account
of
the
sand
and
the
heat
nor
to
remain
conveniently
on
the
spot
with
his
entire
army
withdrew
taking
the
most
of
it
with
him
at
that
the
ethiopians
attacked
the
garrisons
but
he
again
proceeded
against
them
rescued
his
own
men
and
compelled
candace
to
make
terms
with
him
while
this
was
going
on
augustus
went
to
sicily
in
order
to
settle
the
affairs
of
that
island
and
of
other
countries
as
far
as
syria
while
he
was
still
there
the
roman
populace
fell
to
disputing
over
an
election
of
the
consuls
this
incident
showed
clearly
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
be
safe
under
a
democracy
for
with
the
little
power
that
they
had
over
elections
and
in
regard
to
offices
even
they
began
rioting
the
place
of
one
of
the
consuls
was
being
kept
for
augustus
and
in
this
way
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
marcus
lollius
alone
entered
upon
office
as
the
emperor
would
not
accept
the
place
quintus
lepidus
and
lucius
silvanus
became
rival
candidates
and
threw
everything
into
such
turmoil
that
augustus
was
invoked
by
those
who
still
retained
their
senses
he
would
not
return
however
and
sent
them
back
when
they
came
to
him
rebuking
them
and
bidding
them
cast
their
votes
during
the
absence
of
both
claimants
this
did
not
promote
peace
any
the
more
but
they
began
to
quarrel
and
dispute
again
vehemently
so
that
it
was
long
before
lepidus
was
chosen
augustus
was
displeased
at
this
for
he
could
not
spend
all
his
time
at
rome
alone
and
he
did
not
dare
to
leave
the
city
without
a
head
seeking
therefore
for
some
one
to
set
over
it
he
judged
agrippa
to
be
most
suitable
for
the
purpose
and
as
he
wished
to
clothe
him
in
some
greater
dignity
than
common
in
order
that
this
might
help
him
to
govern
the
people
more
easily
he
summoned
him
compelled
him
to
divorce
his
wife
although
she
was
cæsar
own
niece
and
to
marry
julia
and
forthwith
sent
him
to
rome
to
attend
both
to
the
wedding
and
to
the
administration
of
the
city
this
step
is
said
to
have
been
due
partly
to
the
advice
of
mæcenas
who
in
conversation
with
him
upon
these
very
matters
said
you
have
made
him
so
great
that
he
should
either
become
your
or
be
killed
agrippa
healed
the
sores
which
he
found
still
festering
and
repelled
the
advance
of
the
egyptian
rites
which
were
returning
once
more
to
the
city
forbidding
any
one
to
perform
them
even
in
the
suburbs
within
eight
a
disturbance
arose
regarding
the
election
of
the
præfectus
urbi
the
one
chosen
on
account
of
the
feriæ
and
he
did
not
attempt
to
quell
it
but
they
lived
through
that
year
without
that
official
this
was
what
accomplished
augustus
after
settling
various
affairs
in
sicily
and
making
syracuse
together
with
certain
other
cities
roman
colonies
crossed
over
into
greece
the
lacedæmonians
he
honored
by
giving
them
cythera
and
attending
their
public
mess
because
livia
when
she
fled
from
italy
with
her
husband
and
son
passed
some
time
there
from
the
athenians
as
some
say
he
took
away
ægina
and
eretria
the
produce
of
which
they
were
enjoying
because
they
had
espoused
the
cause
of
antony
moreover
he
forbade
them
to
make
any
one
a
citizen
for
money
it
seemed
to
them
that
what
happened
to
the
statue
of
athena
had
tended
to
their
misfortune
placed
on
the
acropolis
facing
the
east
it
had
turned
about
to
the
west
and
spat
blood
as
for
augustus
after
setting
the
greek
world
in
order
he
sailed
to
samos
passed
the
winter
there
and
in
the
spring
when
marcus
apuleius
and
publius
silius
became
consuls
proceeded
to
asia
and
gave
his
attention
to
matters
there
and
in
bithynia
though
these
and
the
foregoing
provinces
were
regarded
as
belonging
to
the
people
he
did
not
make
light
of
them
but
accorded
them
the
very
best
of
care
as
if
they
were
his
own
he
instituted
all
reforms
that
seemed
desirable
and
made
a
present
of
money
to
some
while
others
he
instructed
to
collect
an
amount
in
excess
of
the
tribute
the
people
of
cyzicus
he
reduced
to
slavery
because
during
an
uprising
they
had
flogged
and
put
to
death
some
romans
and
when
he
reached
syria
he
took
the
same
action
in
the
case
of
the
people
of
tyre
and
sidon
on
account
of
their
uprising
meanwhile
phraates
fearing
that
he
might
lead
an
expedition
against
him
because
as
yet
none
of
the
agreements
had
been
carried
out
sent
back
to
him
the
standards
and
all
the
captives
save
a
few
who
in
shame
had
destroyed
themselves
or
by
eluding
detection
had
remained
in
the
country
augustus
received
them
with
the
appearance
of
having
conquered
the
parthian
in
some
war
he
took
great
pride
in
the
event
saying
that
what
had
been
lost
in
former
battles
he
had
recovered
without
a
struggle
indeed
in
honor
of
his
success
he
both
commanded
sacrifices
to
be
voted
and
performed
them
besides
constructing
a
temple
of
mars
ultor
on
the
capitol
in
imitation
of
jupiter
feretrius
for
the
offering
up
of
the
standards
moreover
he
rode
into
the
city
on
a
charger
and
was
with
an
arch
carrying
a
trophy
that
was
what
was
done
later
in
commemoration
of
the
event
at
this
time
he
was
chosen
commissioner
of
the
highways
round
about
rome
set
up
the
golden
milestone
and
assigned
from
the
ranks
of
the
with
two
lictors
to
take
care
of
the
various
streets
julia
also
gave
birth
to
a
child
who
received
the
name
gaius
and
a
sacrifice
of
kine
was
permitted
forever
upon
his
birthday
now
this
was
done
like
everything
else
in
pursuance
of
a
decree
privately
the
ædiles
had
a
and
slaughter
of
wild
beasts
on
the
birthday
of
these
were
the
occurrences
in
the
city
augustus
ordained
that
the
subject
territory
should
be
managed
according
to
the
customs
of
the
romans
but
permitted
allied
countries
to
be
governed
according
to
their
own
ancestral
usage
he
did
not
think
it
desirable
that
there
should
be
any
additions
to
the
former
or
that
any
new
regions
should
be
acquired
but
deemed
it
best
for
the
people
to
be
thoroughly
satisfied
with
what
they
already
possessed
and
he
communicated
this
opinion
to
the
senate
therefore
he
began
no
war
at
this
time
but
gave
out
certain
sovereignties
to
iamblichus
son
of
iamblichus
his
ancestral
dominion
over
the
arabians
and
to
tarcondimotus
son
of
tarcondimotus
the
kingdom
of
cilicia
which
his
father
held
except
a
few
coast
districts
for
these
together
with
lesser
armenia
he
granted
to
archelaus
because
the
median
king
who
had
previously
ruled
them
was
dead
to
herod
he
entrusted
the
tetrarchy
of
a
certain
zenodorus
and
to
one
mithridates
though
a
mere
lad
commagene
since
the
king
of
it
had
killed
his
father
and
as
the
other
armenians
had
preferred
charges
against
artaxes
and
had
summoned
his
brother
tigranes
who
was
in
rome
the
emperor
sent
for
tiberius
to
cast
the
former
out
of
his
kingdom
and
restore
the
latter
to
it
once
more
nothing
was
accomplished
however
worthy
of
the
preparations
he
had
made
for
the
armenians
slew
artaxes
before
his
arrival
still
tiberius
assumed
a
lofty
bearing
as
if
he
had
effected
something
by
his
own
ability
and
all
the
more
when
sacrifices
were
voted
in
honor
of
the
result
and
he
now
began
to
have
thoughts
about
obtaining
the
monarchy
when
as
he
was
approaching
philippi
an
outcry
was
heard
from
the
field
of
battle
as
if
coming
from
an
army
and
fire
of
its
own
accord
shot
up
from
the
altars
founded
by
antony
upon
the
ramparts
these
things
contributed
to
the
exalted
feelings
of
tiberius
augustus
returned
to
samos
and
once
more
passed
the
winter
there
as
a
recompense
for
his
stay
he
awarded
the
islanders
freedom
and
he
attended
to
many
kinds
of
business
great
numbers
of
embassies
came
to
him
and
the
indi
who
had
previously
opened
negotiations
about
friendship
now
made
terms
sending
among
other
gifts
tigers
which
were
then
for
the
first
time
seen
by
the
romans
as
also
i
think
by
the
greeks
they
likewise
presented
to
him
a
boy
without
shoulders
like
the
statues
of
hermes
that
we
now
see
yet
this
creature
in
spite
of
his
anatomy
made
perfect
use
of
his
feet
and
hands
he
would
stretch
a
bow
for
them
shoot
missiles
and
sound
the
trumpet
how
i
do
not
know
i
merely
record
the
story
one
of
the
indi
zarmarus
whether
he
belonged
to
the
class
of
sophists
and
was
ambitious
on
this
account
or
because
he
was
old
and
was
following
some
immemorial
custom
or
because
he
wished
to
make
a
display
for
augustus
and
the
athenians
for
it
was
there
that
he
had
obtained
an
audience
chose
to
die
he
was
therefore
initiated
into
the
service
of
the
two
goddesses
although
it
was
not
the
proper
time
it
is
said
for
the
ritual
through
the
influence
of
augustus
and
having
become
an
initiate
he
threw
himself
alive
into
the
fire
the
consul
that
year
was
gaius
sentius
when
it
was
found
necessary
that
a
colleague
be
appointed
to
hold
office
with
him
for
augustus
again
refused
to
accept
the
post
which
was
being
saved
for
him
an
uprising
once
more
broke
out
in
rome
and
assassinations
occurred
so
that
the
senators
voted
sentius
a
guard
when
he
expressed
himself
as
opposed
to
using
it
they
sent
envoys
to
augustus
each
with
two
lictors
as
soon
as
the
emperor
learned
this
and
felt
assured
that
nothing
but
evil
would
come
of
it
he
did
not
adopt
an
attitude
like
his
former
one
toward
them
but
appointed
consul
from
among
the
envoys
themselves
quintus
lucretius
though
this
man
name
had
been
posted
among
the
proscribed
and
he
hastened
to
rome
himself
for
this
and
his
other
actions
while
absent
from
the
city
many
honors
of
all
sorts
were
voted
none
of
which
he
would
accept
save
the
founding
of
a
temple
to
fortuna
redux
this
being
the
name
they
applied
to
her
and
that
the
day
on
which
he
arrived
should
be
numbered
among
the
thanksgiving
days
and
be
called
augustalia
since
even
then
the
magistrates
and
the
rest
made
preparations
to
go
out
to
meet
him
he
entered
the
city
by
night
and
on
the
following
day
he
gave
tiberius
the
rank
of
the
and
allowed
drusus
to
become
a
candidate
for
offices
five
years
earlier
than
custom
allowed
the
quarrelsome
behavior
of
the
people
during
his
absence
did
not
accord
at
all
with
their
conduct
influenced
by
fear
when
he
was
present
he
was
accordingly
invited
and
elected
to
be
commissioner
of
morals
for
five
years
held
the
authority
of
the
censors
for
the
same
length
of
time
and
that
of
the
consuls
for
life
being
allowed
to
use
the
twelve
rods
always
and
everywhere
and
to
sit
in
the
chair
of
office
in
the
midst
of
the
consuls
of
any
year
after
voting
these
measures
they
begged
him
to
set
right
all
these
matters
and
to
enact
what
laws
he
liked
and
whatever
ordinances
might
be
composed
by
him
they
called
from
that
very
moment
and
desired
to
take
an
oath
that
they
would
abide
by
them
he
accepted
their
principal
propositions
believing
them
to
be
necessary
but
absolved
them
from
the
requirement
of
an
oath
if
they
should
vote
for
a
measure
that
suited
them
he
knew
well
that
they
would
observe
it
even
if
they
made
no
agreement
to
that
effect
otherwise
they
would
not
pay
any
attention
to
it
even
if
they
should
take
ten
thousand
pledges
to
secure
augustus
did
this
of
the
ædiles
one
voluntarily
resigned
his
office
by
reason
of
poverty
agrippa
on
being
sent
at
this
time
as
described
from
sicily
to
rome
transacted
whatever
business
was
urgent
and
was
later
assigned
to
the
gauls
the
inhabitants
there
were
at
war
among
themselves
and
were
being
harshly
used
by
the
celtæ
after
settling
those
troubles
he
went
over
to
spain
for
the
cantabri
who
had
been
captured
alive
in
the
war
and
had
been
sold
severally
killed
their
masters
returned
home
and
united
many
for
a
revolt
with
the
aid
of
these
accessions
they
occupied
available
sites
walled
them
about
and
concocted
schemes
against
the
roman
garrisons
it
was
against
this
tribe
that
agrippa
led
an
expedition
but
he
had
some
trouble
also
with
the
soldiers
not
a
few
of
them
were
too
old
exhausted
by
the
succession
of
wars
and
in
fear
of
the
cantabri
whom
they
regarded
as
hard
to
subdue
and
they
consequently
would
not
obey
him
however
by
admonition
exhortation
and
the
hopes
that
he
held
out
he
soon
made
them
yield
obedience
in
fighting
the
cantabri
on
the
other
hand
he
met
with
many
failures
they
had
the
advantage
of
experience
in
affairs
since
they
had
been
slaves
to
the
romans
and
of
despair
of
ever
gaining
safety
again
in
case
of
capture
agrippa
lost
numbers
of
his
soldiers
and
degraded
numerous
others
because
they
had
been
defeated
among
other
actions
he
prohibited
a
whole
division
called
the
augustan
from
being
so
named
any
longer
still
after
a
long
time
he
destroyed
nearly
all
of
the
enemy
who
were
of
age
for
warfare
he
deprived
the
rest
of
their
arms
and
made
them
go
down
from
the
heights
to
the
flat
lands
yet
he
made
no
communication
about
them
to
the
senate
and
did
not
accept
the
triumph
although
voted
in
accordance
with
instructions
from
augustus
in
these
matters
he
showed
moderation
as
was
his
wont
and
when
asked
once
by
the
consul
for
an
opinion
in
a
case
concerning
his
brother
he
would
not
give
it
at
his
own
expense
he
brought
in
the
parthenian
and
named
it
the
augustan
in
this
the
emperor
took
so
great
delight
that
once
when
a
great
scarcity
of
wine
had
arisen
and
persons
were
making
a
terrible
about
it
he
declared
that
agrippa
had
carefully
seen
to
it
that
they
should
never
perish
of
thirst
such
was
the
character
of
this
man
of
the
rest
many
both
made
a
triumph
their
object
and
celebrated
it
not
for
rendering
these
same
services
but
some
for
having
arrested
robbers
and
others
for
quieting
cities
that
were
in
a
state
of
turmoil
for
augustus
at
first
at
least
bestowed
these
rewards
lavishly
upon
some
and
honored
a
very
great
number
with
public
burials
those
persons
then
gained
splendor
by
these
fêtes
but
agrippa
was
advanced
by
him
to
a
position
of
comparative
independence
augustus
saw
that
the
public
business
required
strict
attention
and
feared
that
he
might
as
often
happens
in
such
cases
become
the
victim
of
plots
u
the
breastplate
which
he
often
wore
beneath
his
dress
even
on
entering
the
senate
itself
he
expected
would
be
of
small
and
slight
assistance
to
him
in
that
case
therefore
he
himself
first
added
five
years
to
his
term
as
supreme
ruler
when
the
period
had
expired
this
took
place
in
the
consulship
of
publius
and
gnaeus
lentulus
and
then
he
gave
agrippa
many
rights
almost
equal
to
his
own
together
with
the
tribunician
authority
for
the
same
length
of
time
he
then
said
that
so
many
years
would
suffice
them
not
much
later
he
obtained
the
remaining
five
belonging
to
his
imperial
sovereignty
so
that
the
number
of
years
became
ten
again
when
he
had
done
this
he
next
investigated
the
senatorial
body
the
members
seemed
to
him
even
now
to
be
numerous
and
he
saw
danger
in
so
large
a
throng
while
he
felt
a
hatred
for
not
only
such
as
were
notorious
for
some
baseness
but
also
those
who
were
distinguished
for
their
flattery
and
when
no
one
as
previously
would
resign
willingly
nor
wished
alone
to
incur
accusation
he
himself
selected
the
thirty
best
men
a
point
which
he
confirmed
by
oath
and
bade
them
after
first
taking
the
same
oath
to
choose
and
write
down
groups
of
five
outside
of
their
relatives
on
tablets
after
this
he
subjected
the
groups
of
five
to
a
casting
of
lots
with
the
arrangement
that
the
one
man
in
each
who
drew
a
lot
should
himself
be
a
senator
and
enroll
five
others
on
the
same
conditions
there
would
of
course
properly
be
thirty
of
those
chosen
by
others
and
by
those
who
drew
a
lot
and
since
some
of
them
were
out
of
town
others
drew
as
substitutes
and
attended
to
what
should
have
been
their
duties
at
first
this
went
on
so
for
several
days
but
when
some
abuses
crept
in
he
no
longer
put
the
documents
in
the
charge
of
the
quaestors
nor
submitted
the
groups
of
five
to
lot
but
he
himself
read
whatever
remained
and
he
himself
chose
the
members
that
were
lacking
and
thus
six
hundred
in
all
were
appointed
it
had
been
his
plan
to
make
them
three
hundred
as
in
old
times
and
he
thought
he
ought
to
be
well
satisfied
if
he
found
so
many
of
them
worthy
of
the
senate
but
he
finally
chose
a
list
of
six
hundred
because
of
the
universal
displeasure
for
it
came
out
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
those
whose
names
would
be
cancelled
would
be
many
more
than
those
who
remained
in
the
body
that
greater
fear
of
becoming
private
citizens
prevailed
among
its
members
than
expectation
of
being
senators
not
even
here
did
the
matter
rest
since
some
unsuitable
persons
were
still
enrolled
a
certain
licinius
regulus
after
this
indignant
because
his
name
had
been
erased
whereas
his
son
and
several
others
to
whom
he
thought
himself
superior
had
been
counted
in
rent
his
clothing
in
the
very
senate
laid
bare
his
body
enumerated
his
campaigns
and
showed
them
his
scars
and
articuleius
pætus
one
of
the
senators
besought
earnestly
that
he
might
retire
from
his
seat
in
the
senate
in
place
of
his
father
who
had
been
rejected
augustus
then
made
a
new
organization
getting
rid
of
some
and
choosing
others
in
their
place
since
even
so
the
names
of
many
had
been
stricken
out
and
some
of
them
as
usually
happens
in
such
a
case
charged
that
they
had
been
driven
out
unjustly
he
immediately
accorded
them
the
right
to
behold
spectacles
and
join
in
festivals
in
common
with
the
senators
wearing
the
same
garb
and
he
permitted
them
for
the
future
to
stand
for
offices
most
of
them
came
back
in
the
course
of
time
into
the
senate
some
few
were
left
in
an
intermediate
position
regarded
as
belonging
neither
to
the
senate
nor
to
the
people
after
this
many
at
once
and
many
subsequently
gained
the
reputation
whether
it
was
true
or
false
of
plotting
against
both
the
emperor
and
agrippa
it
is
not
possible
for
one
outside
of
such
matters
to
have
certain
knowledge
about
them
much
of
what
a
sovereign
does
by
way
of
punishment
either
personally
or
through
the
senate
on
the
ground
that
plots
have
been
made
against
him
is
viewed
with
suspicion
as
probably
a
display
of
wanton
power
no
matter
how
justly
he
may
have
acted
for
that
reason
my
intention
is
to
record
in
all
matters
of
this
nature
simply
the
regular
version
of
the
story
not
busying
myself
with
aught
beyond
the
public
report
except
in
perfectly
patent
cases
nor
making
any
ulterior
suggestions
as
to
whether
any
act
was
just
or
unjust
or
any
statement
true
or
false
let
this
principle
apply
to
everything
which
i
shall
write
after
this
at
the
time
augustus
executed
a
few
lepidus
he
hated
because
his
son
had
been
detected
in
a
against
him
and
had
been
punished
as
well
as
for
other
reasons
he
did
not
however
wish
to
kill
him
but
kept
insulting
him
now
in
one
way
now
in
another
he
ordered
lepidus
against
his
will
to
come
down
from
the
country
to
the
city
and
always
took
him
to
gatherings
in
order
that
the
man
might
be
subjected
to
the
greatest
amount
of
jeering
and
insolence
in
view
of
the
change
from
his
former
power
and
dignity
he
did
not
treat
him
in
any
way
as
worthy
his
consideration
and
at
this
time
he
afforded
him
last
of
all
the
the
chance
of
voting
to
the
rest
he
was
wont
to
put
the
question
in
the
order
that
belonged
to
them
but
of
the
he
used
to
make
one
first
another
second
and
third
and
fourth
and
so
on
as
he
liked
this
the
consuls
also
did
thus
it
was
that
he
treated
lepidus
and
when
antistius
labeo
enrolled
the
latter
among
the
men
who
were
to
be
senators
at
the
time
the
vote
on
this
matter
was
taken
the
emperor
first
declared
that
he
had
perjured
himself
and
threatened
to
take
vengeance
thereupon
the
other
replied
why
what
harm
have
i
done
by
keeping
in
the
senate
one
whom
you
even
now
still
permit
to
be
high
priest
this
answer
quieted
augustus
anger
for
though
he
had
often
both
privately
and
publicly
been
judged
worthy
of
this
priesthood
he
did
not
deem
it
right
to
take
it
while
lepidus
lived
the
reply
of
antistius
seemed
indeed
to
have
been
a
rather
happy
one
as
was
the
case
once
when
there
was
talk
in
the
senate
to
the
effect
that
they
ought
to
take
turns
in
guarding
augustus
for
he
had
said
not
daring
to
speak
in
opposition
nor
willing
to
agree
as
for
me
i
snore
and
so
can
not
sleep
at
the
door
of
his
chamber
among
the
laws
that
augustus
enacted
was
one
which
provided
that
those
who
to
gain
office
bribed
any
person
should
be
debarred
from
the
said
office
for
five
years
he
laid
heavier
penalties
upon
the
unmarried
men
and
women
without
husbands
and
on
the
other
hand
offered
prizes
for
marriage
and
the
procreation
of
children
and
since
among
the
nobility
there
were
far
more
males
than
females
he
allowed
those
who
pleased
save
the
senators
to
marry
freedwomen
and
ordered
that
the
offspring
of
such
a
man
should
be
deemed
legitimate
at
this
period
a
clamor
arose
in
the
senate
regarding
the
disorderly
conduct
of
the
women
and
the
young
men
this
being
alleged
as
a
reason
for
the
difficulty
of
persuading
them
to
contract
marriage
and
when
they
urged
him
to
remedy
this
abuse
also
meanwhile
indulging
in
sarcasms
because
he
enjoyed
the
favors
of
many
women
at
first
he
made
answer
that
the
most
necessary
restrictions
had
been
laid
down
and
that
anything
further
could
not
be
defined
in
a
similar
fashion
then
when
he
was
driven
into
a
corner
he
said
you
ought
to
admonish
and
command
your
wives
what
you
wish
just
as
i
myself
do
when
they
heard
that
they
plied
him
with
questions
all
the
more
wishing
to
learn
the
admonitions
which
he
said
he
gave
livia
reluctantly
thereupon
he
made
a
few
remarks
about
dress
and
about
other
adornment
about
going
out
and
modest
behavior
on
such
occasions
he
cared
not
at
all
that
he
did
not
make
good
his
words
in
fact
something
of
the
sort
he
had
done
also
while
censor
they
brought
before
him
a
young
man
who
had
married
a
woman
after
seducing
her
making
the
most
violent
accusations
against
him
augustus
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
not
daring
to
overlook
the
affair
nor
yet
to
administer
any
rebuke
after
a
very
long
time
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
said
the
factional
disputes
have
borne
many
terrible
fruits
let
us
try
to
forget
them
and
give
our
attention
to
the
future
to
see
that
nothing
of
the
sort
occurs
again
inasmuch
too
as
certain
infants
were
obtaining
by
betrothal
the
honors
of
married
couples
but
did
not
accomplish
the
object
in
view
he
ordered
that
no
betrothal
should
be
valid
where
a
person
did
not
marry
before
two
years
had
passed
that
is
any
one
betrothed
must
be
certainly
ten
years
old
in
order
to
reap
any
benefit
from
it
twelve
full
years
as
i
have
said
is
required
by
custom
for
girls
to
reach
the
marriageable
age
besides
these
separate
enactments
there
was
one
instructing
those
from
time
to
time
in
office
each
to
propose
one
of
those
who
had
been
prætors
three
years
previously
to
attend
to
the
distribution
of
the
grain
and
providing
that
of
that
number
the
four
who
secured
the
lot
should
give
out
grain
in
turn
and
the
præfectus
urbi
appointed
for
the
feriæ
was
always
to
choose
one
of
them
the
sibylline
verses
which
had
become
indistinct
through
lapse
of
time
he
ordered
the
priests
to
copy
out
with
their
own
hands
in
order
that
no
one
else
should
read
them
he
allowed
the
offices
to
be
thrown
open
to
all
such
as
had
property
worth
ten
myriad
denarii
and
were
competent
to
hold
office
in
accordance
with
the
law
this
was
the
value
which
he
at
first
set
upon
the
senatorial
rank
later
he
raised
it
to
myriads
upon
some
of
those
who
lived
upright
lives
but
possessed
less
than
ten
myriads
in
the
first
case
or
in
the
second
he
bestowed
the
amount
lacking
again
he
allowed
those
prætors
who
so
desired
to
spend
on
the
festivals
besides
what
was
given
them
from
the
public
treasury
three
times
as
much
again
so
that
even
if
some
were
vexed
at
the
minuteness
of
his
other
regulations
yet
by
reason
of
this
one
and
also
because
he
brought
back
from
exile
one
pylades
a
dancer
driven
out
on
account
of
civil
quarrels
they
remembered
them
no
longer
hence
pylades
is
said
to
have
rejoined
very
cleverly
when
the
emperor
rebuked
him
for
having
quarreled
with
bathyllus
an
artist
in
the
same
line
and
a
relative
of
mæcenas
it
is
to
your
advantage
cæsar
that
the
populace
should
exhaust
its
energy
over
us
these
were
the
occurrences
of
that
year
in
the
consulship
of
gaius
furnius
and
gaius
silanus
agrippa
again
announced
the
birth
of
a
son
named
lucius
and
augustus
immediately
adopted
him
together
with
his
brother
gaius
not
waiting
for
them
to
become
men
but
appointing
them
that
very
moment
successors
to
his
office
in
order
that
less
plots
might
be
directed
against
him
the
festival
of
honor
and
of
virtus
he
transferred
to
the
days
which
are
at
present
theirs
those
that
celebrated
triumphs
he
commanded
to
erect
out
of
the
spoils
some
public
work
to
commemorate
their
deeds
the
sæcularia
he
brought
for
the
fifth
time
to
a
successful
conclusion
the
orators
he
ordered
were
to
give
their
services
without
pay
on
pain
of
a
fine
of
quadruple
the
amount
they
might
receive
those
whom
the
lot
made
jurymen
in
any
season
he
forbade
to
enter
any
person
house
during
that
year
and
since
members
of
the
senate
showed
lack
of
interest
in
attending
meetings
of
that
body
he
increased
the
penalties
for
such
as
were
late
without
some
good
excuse
next
he
started
for
gaul
during
the
consulship
of
lucius
domitius
and
publius
scipio
making
an
excuse
of
the
wars
that
had
arisen
in
that
region
for
since
he
had
become
disliked
by
many
as
a
result
of
his
long
stay
in
the
capital
and
by
inflicting
penalties
offended
many
who
committed
some
act
contrary
to
the
laws
laid
down
while
he
was
compelled
in
sparing
many
others
to
transgress
his
own
enactments
he
decided
to
leave
the
country
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
solon
some
suspected
that
he
had
gone
away
on
account
of
terentia
the
wife
of
mæcenas
and
intended
because
there
was
much
talk
made
about
them
in
rome
to
join
her
without
any
gossip
during
his
trip
abroad
so
great
was
his
passion
for
her
that
he
once
had
her
enter
a
contest
of
beauty
against
livia
before
starting
he
dedicated
the
temple
of
quirinus
which
he
had
built
up
anew
by
this
i
mean
he
had
adorned
it
with
columns
equal
to
the
total
number
of
years
he
had
lived
this
consequently
caused
some
to
say
that
he
had
chosen
the
number
purposely
and
not
by
mere
chance
after
the
consecration
of
this
edifice
he
arranged
through
tiberius
and
drusus
for
gladiatorial
combats
permission
having
been
granted
them
by
the
senate
then
he
committed
to
taurus
the
management
of
the
city
together
with
the
rest
of
italy
for
agrippa
had
been
despatched
again
to
syria
and
he
no
longer
looked
with
equal
favor
on
mæcenas
because
of
the
latter
wife
and
taking
tiberius
though
he
was
prætor
along
he
set
out
on
his
journey
tiberius
had
become
prætor
in
spite
of
holding
the
honors
of
an
and
his
entire
office
by
a
decree
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
drusus
the
night
following
their
departure
the
hall
of
youth
burned
to
the
ground
this
was
not
the
only
portent
that
had
occurred
for
a
wolf
had
rushed
along
the
sacred
way
into
the
forum
tearing
men
to
pieces
and
at
a
distance
from
the
forum
ants
were
very
plainly
seen
together
in
swarms
likewise
a
gleam
all
night
long
kept
shooting
from
the
south
toward
the
north
prayers
were
therefore
offered
for
the
safe
return
of
augustus
meantime
they
celebrated
the
quinquennial
festival
of
his
sovereignty
the
expense
being
borne
by
agrippa
for
the
latter
had
been
consecrated
by
his
fellow
priests
to
be
one
of
the
quindecimviri
to
whom
the
oversight
of
the
event
fell
in
regular
succession
there
was
much
other
confusion
too
during
that
period
the
camunni
and
vennones
alpine
tribes
flew
to
arms
but
were
conquered
and
subdued
by
publius
silius
the
pannonians
in
company
with
the
norici
overran
istria
and
after
suffering
damage
at
the
hands
of
silius
and
his
lieutenants
the
former
came
to
terms
again
and
were
the
cause
of
the
norici
falling
into
the
same
slavery
the
uprisings
in
dalmatia
and
in
spain
were
in
a
short
time
quelled
macedonia
was
ravaged
by
the
dentheleti
and
the
scordisci
in
thrace
somewhat
earlier
marcus
lollius
while
aiding
rhoemetalces
the
uncle
and
guardian
of
the
children
of
cotys
had
subjugated
the
bessi
later
lucius
gallus
conquered
the
sarmatæ
in
the
same
dispute
and
drove
them
back
across
the
ister
the
greatest
however
of
the
wars
which
at
that
time
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
romans
which
also
had
something
to
do
probably
with
augustus
leaving
the
city
was
against
the
celtæ
the
sugambri
usipetes
and
tencteri
had
first
seized
in
their
own
territory
some
of
the
romans
and
had
crucified
them
after
which
they
crossed
the
rhine
and
plundered
germania
and
gaul
when
the
roman
cavalry
approached
they
laid
an
ambush
and
by
taking
to
flight
drew
their
assailants
to
follow
them
and
though
they
fell
in
unexpectedly
with
the
roman
leader
lollius
they
conquered
even
him
on
ascertaining
this
augustus
hastened
against
them
but
found
no
warfare
to
carry
on
for
the
barbarians
learning
that
lollius
was
getting
ready
and
that
the
emperor
was
also
heading
an
expedition
retired
into
their
own
territory
and
made
peace
giving
hostages
on
this
account
augustus
had
no
need
of
arms
but
the
demands
of
various
other
business
consumed
the
entire
time
of
this
year
as
well
as
of
the
next
in
which
marcus
libo
and
calpurnius
piso
were
consuls
for
much
injury
had
been
wrought
by
the
celtæ
and
much
by
a
certain
licinnius
and
of
this
i
think
the
had
very
plainly
given
them
warning
beforehand
this
creature
twenty
feet
broad
and
three
times
as
long
and
resembling
a
woman
except
for
its
head
had
been
washed
up
on
the
land
from
the
ocean
now
licinnius
was
originally
a
gaul
but
was
captured
brought
among
romans
and
made
a
slave
to
cæsar
by
whom
he
was
set
free
and
then
by
augustus
he
had
been
made
procurator
of
gaul
he
had
barbarian
avarice
and
roman
haughtiness
and
tried
to
overthrow
every
person
and
thing
deemed
superior
to
himself
and
to
annihilate
any
power
which
temporarily
appeared
strong
it
was
his
care
to
supply
himself
with
plenty
of
funds
for
the
requirements
of
his
ministry
as
well
as
to
secure
a
plenty
for
himself
and
for
members
of
his
family
his
abuses
went
so
far
that
in
some
cases
where
the
population
paid
tribute
by
the
month
he
made
the
months
fourteen
in
number
he
declared
that
this
month
called
december
was
really
the
tenth
and
for
that
reason
it
was
necessary
to
count
in
also
the
two
last
months
of
which
he
called
one
undecimber
and
the
other
duodecimber
and
to
contribute
the
money
that
was
due
for
them
these
quibbles
brought
him
into
danger
the
gauls
secured
the
ear
of
augustus
and
made
a
terrible
protest
so
that
the
emperor
first
shared
their
indignation
and
next
begged
them
to
be
patient
of
some
of
the
extortions
he
said
he
was
unaware
and
others
he
affected
not
to
believe
some
things
he
concealed
being
ashamed
of
having
employed
such
a
procurator
licinnius
however
by
devising
another
scheme
was
enabled
to
laugh
to
scorn
absolutely
all
their
efforts
when
found
that
augustus
was
displeased
with
him
and
that
he
was
likely
to
be
punished
he
took
the
emperor
into
his
house
and
showing
him
many
treasures
of
silver
and
gold
and
many
other
valuables
piled
up
in
heaps
he
said
i
have
gathered
these
purposely
master
for
you
and
for
the
rest
of
the
romans
to
prevent
the
inhabitants
from
getting
control
of
so
much
money
and
therefore
revolting
you
see
i
have
kept
it
all
for
you
and
herewith
give
it
to
you
thus
the
sophist
was
saved
by
pretending
that
he
had
sapped
the
strength
of
the
barbarians
to
serve
augustus
drusus
and
tiberius
meanwhile
were
concerned
with
the
following
undertakings
the
rhæti
who
dwell
between
noricum
and
gaul
near
the
tridentine
alps
close
to
italy
overran
a
good
part
of
the
adjacent
territory
of
gaul
and
carried
plunder
even
out
of
italy
such
of
the
romans
or
their
allies
as
used
the
road
going
through
their
country
met
with
depredations
these
actions
of
theirs
were
of
course
more
or
less
like
those
of
any
nation
which
has
not
accepted
terms
of
peace
but
further
they
destroyed
all
the
males
among
their
captives
not
only
those
who
were
apparent
but
also
the
embryo
ones
in
the
wombs
of
women
the
sex
of
which
they
discovered
by
some
divination
for
these
reasons
augustus
first
sent
drusus
against
them
he
joined
battle
with
a
detachment
of
theirs
that
met
him
near
the
tridentine
mountains
and
speedily
had
them
routed
for
this
exploit
he
received
the
honors
belonging
to
prætors
later
when
the
tribe
had
been
repulsed
from
italy
but
still
harassed
gaul
the
emperor
despatched
tiberius
in
addition
both
of
the
leaders
then
invaded
the
rhætian
country
at
many
points
at
once
the
lieutenants
leading
such
divisions
as
they
did
not
command
personally
and
tiberius
even
crossed
the
lake
in
boats
in
this
way
by
encountering
them
separately
the
roman
commanders
spread
alarm
and
had
no
difficulty
in
overcoming
those
who
came
near
enough
for
fighting
at
any
time
because
they
had
only
to
deal
with
scattered
forces
the
remainder
who
had
become
weaker
and
more
despondent
through
such
tactics
they
captured
and
because
the
land
had
a
large
population
of
males
and
seemed
ripe
for
revolt
they
deported
most
of
those
of
military
age
especially
the
strongest
leaving
behind
only
so
many
as
would
be
sufficient
to
inhabit
the
country
but
unable
to
make
any
uprising
this
same
year
vedius
pollio
died
a
man
who
in
general
had
done
nothing
deserving
notice
being
the
son
of
liberti
ranking
as
a
knight
without
any
achievement
of
consequence
in
his
record
but
he
had
become
exceedingly
renowned
for
his
wealth
and
his
cruelty
so
that
he
has
even
won
a
place
in
history
most
of
the
things
that
he
did
it
would
be
wearisome
to
relate
but
i
may
mention
that
he
kept
in
tanks
huge
eels
trained
to
eat
men
and
was
accustomed
to
throw
to
them
the
slaves
that
he
desired
to
put
to
death
once
when
he
was
entertaining
augustus
the
cupbearer
shattered
a
crystal
goblet
and
without
respect
to
the
guest
he
ordered
that
the
fellow
be
thrown
to
the
eels
hereupon
the
boy
fell
on
his
knees
supplicating
augustus
who
at
first
tried
to
persuade
pollio
not
to
carry
out
his
intentions
as
his
host
would
not
yield
the
point
the
emperor
said
bring
all
the
rest
of
the
drinking
vessels
which
are
of
the
same
sort
or
any
others
of
value
that
you
may
possess
for
i
want
to
use
them
and
when
they
were
brought
he
ordered
them
to
be
broken
the
master
seeing
this
was
of
course
vexed
but
could
no
longer
be
angry
over
one
cup
considering
the
great
number
of
others
that
were
ruined
and
could
not
punish
his
servant
for
what
augustus
had
done
therefore
reluctantly
he
took
no
action
that
was
the
sort
of
person
this
pollio
was
who
died
he
left
various
bequests
to
many
different
persons
and
to
augustus
a
good
share
of
his
inheritance
together
with
pausilypum
a
place
between
neapolis
and
puteoli
with
instructions
that
some
public
work
of
great
beauty
should
be
erected
augustus
razed
his
house
to
the
foundation
on
the
pretext
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
preparation
of
the
other
structure
but
really
with
the
purpose
that
he
should
have
no
monument
in
the
city
and
built
a
colonnade
inscribing
on
it
the
name
not
of
pollio
but
of
livia
this
he
did
later
at
the
time
mentioned
he
founded
a
number
of
cities
as
colonies
in
gaul
and
in
spain
and
restored
to
the
people
of
cyzicus
their
freedom
to
the
paphians
who
had
suffered
from
an
earthquake
he
gave
money
and
allowed
them
by
a
decree
to
call
their
city
augusta
i
have
recorded
this
not
because
augustus
himself
and
the
senators
failed
to
aid
many
other
cities
both
before
and
after
this
in
case
of
similar
misfortunes
if
any
one
should
attempt
to
mention
them
all
the
task
of
such
a
historian
would
be
endless
but
my
aim
is
to
show
that
the
senate
assigned
names
to
cities
as
an
honor
and
the
latter
did
not
as
is
the
usual
procedure
now
compile
for
themselves
each
separately
such
lists
of
names
as
they
might
choose
the
next
year
marcus
crassus
and
gnæus
cornelius
became
consuls
and
the
curule
ædiles
after
resigning
their
office
because
they
had
entered
upon
it
under
unfavorable
auguries
took
it
back
again
contrary
to
precedent
at
another
meeting
of
the
assembly
the
portico
of
paulus
was
burned
and
the
fire
from
it
reached
the
temple
of
vesta
so
that
the
sacred
objects
that
this
shrine
contained
were
carried
up
to
the
palatine
by
all
of
the
vestal
virgins
except
the
eldest
who
had
gone
blind
and
were
placed
in
the
house
of
the
priest
of
jupiter
the
portico
was
afterward
rebuilt
nominally
by
æmilius
who
was
the
representative
of
the
family
that
had
formerly
erected
it
but
really
by
augustus
and
the
friends
of
paulus
at
this
time
the
pannonians
revolted
and
were
again
subdued
and
the
maritime
alps
inhabited
by
ligurians
called
cometæ
and
still
free
even
then
were
reduced
to
a
slave
district
the
revolt
in
the
cimmerian
bosporus
was
also
quelled
one
seribonius
who
maintained
that
he
was
a
grandson
of
mithridates
and
had
received
the
kingdom
from
augustus
after
the
death
of
asander
married
the
latter
wife
named
dynamis
who
was
the
daughter
of
pharnaces
and
a
grandchild
of
mithridates
and
obtaining
the
power
committed
to
her
by
her
husband
got
control
of
bosporus
agrippa
on
being
informed
of
this
sent
against
him
polemon
king
of
the
pontus
near
cappadocia
he
found
seribonius
no
longer
alive
for
the
people
of
bosporus
learning
of
his
ambitions
had
killed
him
beforehand
but
when
these
resisted
polemon
out
of
fear
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
reign
over
them
he
engaged
them
in
a
set
battle
the
victory
was
his
but
he
was
unable
to
reduce
them
to
order
until
agrippa
came
to
sinope
apparently
with
the
intention
of
conducting
a
campaign
against
them
at
that
they
laid
down
their
arms
and
were
delivered
to
polemon
the
woman
dynamis
became
his
spouse
of
course
with
the
sanction
of
augustus
for
this
outcome
sacrifices
were
made
in
the
name
of
agrippa
but
he
did
not
celebrate
the
triumph
though
voted
to
him
nay
he
did
not
so
much
as
write
the
senate
anything
about
what
had
been
accomplished
as
a
result
subsequent
conquerors
taking
his
method
as
a
law
no
longer
sent
any
word
themselves
to
the
legislative
body
and
did
not
accept
the
celebration
of
a
triumph
for
this
reason
no
one
else
among
his
peers
so
i
am
inclined
to
think
was
permitted
to
do
this
but
they
enjoyed
merely
the
ornament
of
triumphal
honors
augustus
finally
finished
ordering
everything
in
the
gauls
the
germanias
and
the
hispaniæ
upon
special
districts
he
spent
a
great
deal
and
levied
a
great
deal
upon
others
and
to
some
he
gave
freedom
and
citizenship
whereas
from
others
he
took
them
away
he
then
left
drusus
in
germania
and
himself
returned
to
rome
in
the
consulship
of
tiberius
and
of
quintilius
varus
it
chanced
that
the
news
of
his
coming
reached
the
city
during
those
days
when
cornelius
balbus
after
dedicating
the
theatre
now
called
by
his
name
was
giving
spectacles
at
this
he
assumed
great
importance
as
if
it
were
he
that
was
to
bring
augustus
back
though
because
of
a
flooding
of
the
tiber
there
was
so
great
a
quantity
of
water
in
the
theatre
that
no
one
could
enter
it
save
in
a
boat
and
tiberius
put
the
vote
to
balbus
first
as
an
honor
for
his
building
the
theatre
the
senate
convened
and
among
other
decisions
resolved
to
place
an
altar
in
the
itself
to
commemorate
the
return
of
augustus
and
that
criminals
who
approached
him
as
suppliants
within
the
pomerium
should
be
exempt
from
punishment
however
he
accepted
neither
of
these
honors
and
even
escaped
a
reception
by
the
people
on
this
occasion
by
being
brought
into
the
city
under
the
cover
of
night
this
he
did
almost
always
whenever
he
had
to
go
out
to
the
suburbs
or
anywhere
else
both
on
his
way
out
and
on
his
way
back
so
that
nobody
should
annoy
him
the
following
day
he
greeted
the
people
on
the
palatine
ascended
the
capitol
and
taking
off
the
laurel
from
around
his
rods
he
placed
it
upon
the
knees
of
jupiter
for
that
day
he
furnished
the
people
with
baths
and
barbers
free
of
charge
after
this
he
convened
the
senate
and
made
no
address
himself
by
reason
of
hoarseness
but
gave
the
book
to
the
quaestor
to
read
which
enumerated
his
achievements
and
promulgated
rules
as
to
how
many
years
the
citizens
should
serve
in
the
army
and
how
much
money
they
should
receive
at
the
end
of
their
services
in
place
of
the
land
for
which
they
were
always
wont
to
ask
the
object
was
that
by
being
enlisted
on
certain
specified
terms
from
the
very
start
they
should
find
in
their
treatment
no
excuse
for
revolt
the
number
of
years
was
for
the
pretorians
twelve
and
for
the
rest
sixteen
and
the
money
to
be
distributed
was
less
for
some
and
more
for
others
these
measures
caused
the
soldiers
neither
pleasure
nor
anger
for
the
time
being
because
they
had
neither
obtained
all
they
were
desiring
nor
yet
lost
everything
in
the
remainder
of
the
population
it
aroused
confident
hopes
of
not
being
deprived
of
their
possessions
in
the
future
his
next
action
was
to
dedicate
the
theatre
called
after
marcellus
in
the
festival
held
on
this
account
the
patrician
children
as
well
as
his
grandson
gaius
performed
the
troy
equestrian
exercise
and
six
hundred
libyan
wild
beasts
were
slaughtered
iullus
the
son
of
antony
who
was
prætor
celebrated
the
birthday
of
augustus
with
and
slaughterlng
of
wild
beasts
and
entertained
both
him
and
the
senate
following
a
decree
of
that
body
upon
the
capitol
after
this
there
was
another
reorganization
of
the
senate
at
first
the
necessary
value
of
their
property
had
been
limited
to
ten
myriad
denarii
because
many
of
them
had
been
deprived
by
the
wars
of
their
ancestral
estates
as
time
went
on
and
men
possessions
became
larger
it
was
advanced
to
myriads
and
no
one
was
any
longer
found
who
wanted
to
be
senator
on
the
contrary
some
children
and
grandchildren
of
senators
of
whom
a
part
were
really
poor
and
another
part
had
been
brought
low
through
calamities
suffered
by
their
ancestors
not
only
failed
to
lay
claim
to
the
senatorial
dignity
but
when
already
placed
on
the
list
withdrew
on
oath
therefore
previous
to
this
while
augustus
was
still
out
of
the
city
a
decree
had
been
passed
that
the
viginti
viri
should
be
appointed
from
the
knights
hence
none
of
them
was
any
longed
enrolled
in
the
senate
without
having
secured
some
one
of
the
other
offices
that
lead
to
these
twenty
men
are
a
part
of
the
three
of
them
have
charge
of
capital
cases
at
law
the
next
three
attend
to
the
coinage
of
the
money
four
act
as
commissioners
of
the
streets
in
the
city
ten
are
put
over
the
courts
that
fall
by
lot
to
the
the
two
who
were
entrusted
with
the
roads
outside
the
walls
and
the
four
who
were
sent
to
campania
had
been
abolished
the
senate
had
voted
during
the
absence
of
augustus
another
measure
besides
this
namely
that
since
nobody
could
any
longer
be
easily
induced
to
become
a
candidate
for
the
tribuneship
they
might
appoint
by
lot
some
who
had
been
quæstors
and
were
not
yet
forty
years
old
at
this
time
the
emperor
made
a
scrutiny
of
the
whole
body
of
citizens
those
of
them
who
were
over
years
of
age
he
did
not
trouble
but
those
under
that
age
who
had
property
of
the
requisite
value
he
forced
to
become
senators
except
in
the
case
of
cripples
their
bodies
he
viewed
himself
but
in
regard
to
their
property
he
accepted
sworn
statements
the
men
themselves
taking
the
oath
with
others
to
corroborate
their
allegations
and
accounting
for
their
lack
of
funds
as
well
as
for
their
habits
of
life
nor
did
he
while
observing
such
strictness
in
ordinary
public
business
neglect
the
conduct
of
his
own
family
indeed
he
rebuked
tiberius
because
he
had
seated
gaius
beside
him
at
the
thanksgiving
festival
which
he
gave
in
honor
of
the
emperor
return
and
he
censured
the
people
for
honoring
him
with
applause
and
eulogies
on
the
death
of
lepidus
he
was
appointed
high
priest
and
the
senate
consequently
wished
to
vote
him
certain
honors
but
he
declared
that
he
would
not
accept
them
and
when
the
senators
became
urgent
he
rose
and
left
the
gathering
so
that
measure
was
not
ratified
and
he
received
no
official
residence
but
because
it
was
absolutely
essential
that
the
high
priest
should
live
on
public
ground
he
made
a
portion
of
his
own
dwelling
public
property
the
house
of
the
rex
sacrificulus
however
he
gave
to
the
vestal
virgins
because
it
was
separated
merely
by
a
wall
from
their
apartments
cornelius
sisenna
was
blamed
for
the
conduct
of
his
wife
and
stated
in
the
senate
that
he
had
married
her
with
the
knowledge
and
on
the
advice
of
the
emperor
whereat
augustus
grew
exceedingly
angry
he
indulged
in
no
violence
of
word
or
action
but
hurried
out
of
the
and
then
a
little
later
came
back
again
choosing
rather
to
do
this
as
he
said
to
his
friends
afterward
in
spite
of
its
not
being
right
than
to
remain
where
he
was
and
be
compelled
to
do
some
harm
meantime
he
bestowed
upon
agrippa
who
had
come
from
syria
the
great
honor
of
the
tribunician
authority
for
another
five
years
and
sent
him
out
to
pannonia
which
was
ready
for
war
allowing
him
greater
powers
than
officials
outside
of
italy
ordinarily
possessed
agrippa
made
the
campaign
though
it
already
was
winter
marcus
valerius
and
publius
sulpicius
were
the
consuls
as
the
pannonians
became
terror
stricken
at
his
approach
and
showed
no
further
signs
of
uprising
he
returned
and
on
reaching
campania
fell
sick
augustus
happened
to
be
giving
under
the
name
of
his
children
contests
of
armed
warriors
at
the
panathenaic
festival
and
when
he
learned
of
agrippa
condition
he
left
the
country
finding
him
dead
he
conveyed
his
body
to
the
capital
and
allowed
it
to
lie
in
state
in
the
forum
he
also
delivered
the
oration
over
the
dead
man
with
a
curtain
stretched
in
front
of
the
corpse
why
he
did
this
i
know
not
yet
some
have
said
it
was
because
he
was
high
priest
and
others
because
he
was
discharging
the
functions
of
censor
both
are
mistaken
a
high
priest
is
not
forbidden
to
behold
a
corpse
nor
yet
a
censor
except
when
he
is
about
to
put
the
finishing
touches
to
the
census
then
if
he
sees
such
an
object
before
his
purification
all
his
work
is
rendered
null
and
void
besides
this
oration
augustus
conducted
his
funeral
procession
in
the
way
that
his
own
was
later
conducted
he
buried
him
in
his
own
tomb
though
the
deceased
had
a
lot
of
his
own
in
the
campus
martius
such
was
the
end
of
agrippa
who
had
in
every
way
proved
himself
clearly
the
noblest
of
the
men
of
his
day
and
used
the
friendship
of
augustus
for
the
emperor
own
greatest
benefit
and
for
that
of
the
commonwealth
so
much
as
he
surpassed
others
in
excellence
to
such
an
extent
did
he
voluntarily
make
himself
lower
than
his
patron
he
employed
all
his
own
skill
and
bravery
for
what
would
prove
most
profitable
to
augustus
and
expended
all
the
honor
and
power
received
from
him
on
benefiting
others
as
a
result
he
never
became
in
the
least
troublesome
to
augustus
nor
the
object
of
jealousy
on
the
part
of
others
he
helped
his
friend
organize
the
monarchy
like
one
who
was
really
in
love
with
the
idea
of
supreme
power
and
he
won
over
the
populace
by
his
kindness
showing
himself
most
truly
a
friend
of
the
people
at
his
death
he
left
them
gardens
and
the
called
after
his
name
so
that
they
might
bathe
free
of
charge
and
he
gave
augustus
certain
lands
for
this
purpose
the
latter
not
only
rendered
these
public
property
but
distributed
to
the
people
also
a
hundred
denarii
apiece
with
the
explanation
that
agrippa
had
ordered
it
he
had
inherited
most
of
the
deceased
property
among
the
articles
of
which
was
the
hellespontine
chersonese
which
had
come
i
know
not
how
into
the
possession
of
agrippa
the
emperor
felt
his
loss
for
a
very
long
time
and
therefore
caused
the
populace
to
hold
him
in
honor
a
posthumous
son
born
to
him
he
called
agrippa
however
he
did
not
allow
any
of
the
citizens
to
omit
any
of
the
ancestral
customs
although
none
of
the
more
prominent
men
wished
to
present
himself
for
the
festivals
and
he
personally
superintended
the
gladiatorial
combats
they
were
often
given
too
in
his
this
demise
of
agrippa
was
not
only
a
private
loss
to
his
own
household
but
a
public
loss
to
all
the
romans
as
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
portents
occurred
on
this
occasion
as
great
as
were
usually
seen
before
the
most
tremendous
disasters
owls
gathered
in
the
capital
and
a
bolt
of
lightning
descended
upon
the
house
at
albanum
where
the
consuls
reside
during
the
sacrifices
the
star
called
comet
stood
for
several
days
over
the
city
and
was
finally
dissolved
into
flashes
of
light
many
buildings
in
the
city
were
destroyed
by
fire
among
them
the
tent
of
romulus
which
was
set
ablaze
by
crows
dropping
upon
it
burning
meat
from
some
these
were
the
matters
of
interest
connected
with
agrippa
after
this
augustus
was
chosen
supervisor
and
corrector
of
morals
for
another
five
years
this
also
he
received
for
a
limited
period
as
he
had
the
monarchy
and
he
ordered
the
senators
to
burn
incense
as
often
as
they
had
a
sitting
and
not
to
come
to
his
residence
the
first
that
they
might
show
reverence
to
the
gods
and
the
second
that
they
might
have
no
difficulty
in
convening
inasmuch
as
very
few
became
candidates
for
the
tribuneship
on
account
of
its
power
having
been
abolished
he
made
a
law
that
magistrates
should
each
nominate
one
of
the
knights
who
possessed
not
less
than
myriads
the
people
should
then
choose
from
these
the
number
lacking
and
if
the
men
desired
to
be
senators
afterward
well
and
good
otherwise
they
should
return
again
to
the
rank
of
knights
the
province
of
asia
also
stood
very
greatly
in
need
of
some
assistance
on
account
of
earthquakes
and
he
therefore
paid
into
the
public
treasury
from
his
own
resources
their
annual
tribute
and
assigned
them
a
governor
for
two
years
chosen
by
lot
and
not
arbitrarily
selected
apuleius
and
mæcenas
were
at
one
time
bitterly
reviled
in
some
court
of
adultery
not
because
they
had
themselves
behaved
wantonly
but
because
they
had
actively
aided
the
man
on
trial
thereupon
augustus
entered
the
courtroom
and
sat
in
the
prætor
chair
he
did
nothing
violent
but
simply
forbade
the
accuser
to
insult
his
relatives
or
friends
and
then
rose
and
left
the
place
for
this
action
and
others
the
senators
honored
him
with
statues
paid
for
by
private
subscription
and
by
giving
bachelors
and
spinsters
the
right
to
behold
spectacles
with
other
people
and
to
attend
banquets
on
his
birthday
neither
of
these
privileges
was
previously
permitted
them
when
now
agrippa
whom
he
loved
for
his
excellence
and
not
through
any
compulsion
had
died
the
emperor
found
that
he
needed
an
assistant
in
the
public
business
one
who
would
far
surpass
the
rest
in
both
honor
and
power
who
might
manage
everything
opportunely
and
be
free
from
envy
and
plots
therefore
he
reluctantly
chose
tiberius
for
his
own
grandsons
were
at
this
time
still
minors
he
caused
him
also
to
divorce
his
wife
though
she
was
a
daughter
of
agrippa
by
another
marriage
and
had
one
child
an
infant
and
was
soon
to
give
birth
to
another
and
having
betrothed
julia
to
him
he
sent
him
out
against
the
pannonians
this
people
had
for
a
time
been
quiet
fearing
agrippa
but
now
after
his
death
they
revolted
tiberius
subdued
them
having
ravaged
considerable
of
their
territory
and
done
much
injury
to
its
inhabitants
he
had
as
enthusiastic
allies
the
scordisci
who
were
neighbors
of
theirs
and
similarly
equipped
he
took
away
their
arms
and
sold
for
export
most
of
the
male
population
that
was
of
age
for
these
achievements
the
senate
voted
him
a
triumph
but
augustus
did
not
allow
him
to
hold
it
granting
him
instead
the
triumphal
honors
drusus
had
this
same
experience
the
sugambri
and
their
allies
owing
to
the
absence
of
augustus
and
the
fact
that
the
gauls
were
restive
under
the
yoke
of
slavery
had
become
hostile
and
he
therefore
occupied
the
subject
territory
before
them
sending
for
the
foremost
men
on
the
pretext
of
the
festival
which
they
celebrate
even
now
about
the
altar
of
augustus
at
lugdunum
also
he
observed
the
celtae
crossing
the
rhine
and
drove
them
back
next
he
crossed
over
to
the
land
of
the
usipetes
opposite
the
very
island
of
the
batavi
and
from
there
marched
along
the
river
to
the
sugambri
country
devastating
vast
stretches
he
sailed
along
the
rhine
to
the
ocean
conciliated
the
frisii
and
traversing
the
lake
invaded
chaucis
where
he
ran
in
danger
as
his
boats
were
left
high
and
dry
at
the
of
the
ocean
he
was
saved
at
this
time
by
the
frisii
who
joined
his
expedition
with
infantry
and
withdrew
for
it
was
now
winter
coming
to
rome
he
was
made
aedile
in
the
consulship
of
quintus
aelius
and
paulus
fabius
though
he
had
already
prætor
honors
at
the
opening
of
the
spring
he
set
out
again
to
the
war
crossed
the
rhine
and
subjugated
the
usipetes
he
bridged
the
lupia
invaded
the
country
of
the
sugambri
and
advanced
through
it
into
cheruscis
as
far
as
the
visurgis
he
was
able
to
do
this
because
the
sugambri
in
anger
at
the
chatti
the
only
tribe
among
their
neighbors
that
had
refused
to
join
their
alliance
had
made
a
campaign
of
the
whole
population
against
them
drusus
took
this
opportunity
to
traverse
their
country
unnoticed
and
he
would
nave
crossed
also
the
visurgis
had
not
provisions
grown
scarce
and
the
their
country
and
though
beaten
at
first
vanquished
them
in
turn
and
ravaged
both
that
land
and
the
territory
of
adjacent
tribes
which
had
taken
part
in
the
uprising
immediately
he
reduced
all
of
them
to
subjugation
gaining
control
of
some
with
their
consent
terrifying
others
into
reluctant
submission
and
engaging
in
pitched
battles
with
others
later
when
some
of
them
rebelled
he
again
enslaved
them
and
for
this
thanksgivings
and
triumphal
honors
were
accorded
him
while
these
events
were
occurring
augustus
took
a
census
reckoning
in
all
the
property
that
belonged
to
him
as
an
individual
might
do
and
also
making
a
list
of
the
senate
as
he
saw
that
many
were
not
always
present
at
the
meetings
he
ordered
that
even
less
than
four
hundred
might
constitute
a
quorum
for
passing
decrees
previously
that
had
been
the
minimum
number
for
ratifying
any
measure
the
senate
and
the
people
again
contributed
money
to
be
spent
on
images
of
himself
but
he
would
erect
no
such
likeness
and
only
set
up
representations
of
the
public
health
of
concord
and
of
peace
the
citizens
were
always
collecting
money
for
statues
to
him
on
the
slightest
excuse
and
at
last
they
ceased
paying
it
privately
as
before
but
would
come
to
him
on
the
first
day
of
the
year
and
give
some
more
some
less
he
after
adding
as
much
or
more
again
would
return
it
not
only
to
the
senators
but
to
all
the
rest
i
have
also
heard
the
story
that
on
one
day
of
the
year
following
some
oracle
or
dream
he
would
assume
the
guise
of
a
beggar
and
would
accept
money
from
those
who
passed
this
whether
trustworthy
or
not
is
a
prevailing
tradition
that
year
he
gave
julia
in
marriage
to
tiberius
and
his
sister
octavia
dying
he
caused
her
body
to
lie
in
state
in
the
of
julius
on
this
occasion
too
he
had
a
curtain
over
the
corpse
he
himself
delivered
there
the
funeral
speech
and
drusus
having
changed
his
senatorial
dress
had
a
place
on
the
platform
for
the
mourning
was
a
public
affair
her
body
was
carried
in
procession
by
her
not
all
the
honors
voted
to
her
were
accepted
by
augustus
at
this
same
time
the
first
priest
of
jupiter
since
merula
was
appointed
and
the
quaestors
were
ordered
to
pay
careful
heed
to
the
decrees
passed
from
time
to
time
because
the
tribunes
and
the
ædiles
who
had
previously
been
entrusted
with
this
business
transacted
it
through
their
assistants
and
as
a
result
some
mistakes
and
confusion
took
place
it
was
voted
moreover
that
the
temple
of
janus
geminus
which
was
open
should
be
closed
on
the
assumption
that
wars
had
ceased
it
was
not
closed
however

the
dacians
crossing
the

the

booty

the
following
year
drusus
became
consul
with
titus
crispinus
and
omens
occurred
that
were
not
favorable
to
him
many
buildings
were
destroyed
by
storm
and
thunderbolts
among
them
many
temples
even
that
of
jupiter
capitolinus
and
the
temple
annexed
to
it
were
injured
he
however
paid
no
attention
to
this
and
invaded
the
country
of
the
chatti
advancing
as
far
as
suebia
conquering
the
territory
traversed
not
without
hardship
and
vanquishing
the
troops
that
assailed
him
not
without
bloodshed
from
there
he
marched
to
cheruscis
and
crossing
the
visurgis
proceeded
as
far
as
the
albis
pillaging
the
entire
district
this
albis
rises
in
the
vandaliscan
mountains
and
empties
in
a
great
flood
into
the
ocean
this
side
of
the
arctic
sea
drusus
undertook
to
cross
it
but
failing
in
the
attempt
set
up
trophies
and
withdrew
for
a
woman
taller
than
mankind
confronted
him
and
said
whither
are
thou
hastening
insatiable
drusus
it
is
not
fated
that
thou
shalt
see
all
this
region
depart
for
thee
the
end
of
labor
and
of
life
is
already
at
hand
it
is
strange
to
think
that
any
such
voice
should
have
come
to
a
person
ears
from
the
apparition
yet
i
can
not
discredit
the
tale
for
he
at
once
retired
and
as
he
was
returning
in
haste
he
died
on
the
way
of
some
disease
before
he
reached
the
rhine
proof
of
the
story
seems
to
me
to
lie
in
the
fact
that
at
the
time
of
his
death
wolves
prowled
and
yelped
about
the
camp
and
two
youths
were
seen
riding
through
the
middle
of
the
ramparts
a
kind
of
lamentation
in
a
woman
voice
was
also
heard
and
there
were
shooting
stars
in
the
sky
these
are
the
noteworthy
points
augustus
soon
learning
that
he
was
sick
for
he
was
not
far
off
sent
tiberius
to
him
with
speed
the
latter
found
him
still
breathing
and
on
his
death
carried
his
body
to
rome
causing
the
centurions
and
military
tribunes
to
convey
him
over
the
first
stage
as
far
as
the
winter
quarters
of
the
army
and
from
there
the
foremost
men
of
each
city
when
the
deceased
was
laid
in
state
in
the
forum
a
double
funeral
oration
was
delivered
tiberius
eulogized
him
there
and
augustus
in
the
flaminian
hippodrome
since
the
latter
had
been
abroad
on
a
campaign
it
was
impious
for
him
to
do
otherwise
than
perform
the
fitting
rites
in
honor
of
the
exploits
of
drusus
at
the
very
entrance
of
the
pomerium
the
body
was
carried
to
the
campus
martius
by
the
knights
both
those
who
belonged
strictly
to
the
equestrian
order
and
those
as
well
who
were
of
senatorial
family
then
after
being
given
to
the
flames
it
was
deposited
in
the
monument
of
augustus
he
and
his
children
received
the
title
of
germanicus
and
honors
in
the
way
of
both
images
and
an
arch
besides
obtaining
a
cenotaph
close
to
the
rhine
itself
tiberius
while
drusus
was
still
alive
had
overcome
the
dalmatians
and
pannonians
who
were
again
a
little
restless
had
celebrated
a
triumph
on
horseback
and
had
banqueted
the
people
a
part
on
the
capitol
and
a
part
in
many
other
places
at
this
time
also
livia
and
julia
together
entertained
the
women
same
festivities
were
being
made
ready
for
drusus
the
feriæ
were
to
be
held
a
second
time
on
this
account
so
that
he
might
celebrate
his
triumph
on
the
same
occasion
but
his
untimely
death
upset
the
plans
as
a
consolation
to
livia
images
were
awarded
her
and
she
was
enrolled
among
the
mothers
of
three
children
for
upon
such
men
or
women
as
are
not
granted
so
many
offspring
by
heaven
or
at
least
upon
some
of
them
a
law
emanating
formerly
from
the
senate
but
now
from
the
emperor
bestows
the
dignities
belonging
to
parents
of
three
children
in
this
way
they
are
not
subject
to
the
reproaches
for
childlessness
and
may
receive
all
but
a
few
of
the
prizes
for
fecundity
not
only
men
but
gods
enjoy
the
privilege
to
the
end
that
if
any
one
dying
leaves
them
anything
they
may
take
possession
of
it
these
are
the
facts
of
the
matter
augustus
ordered
that
the
sittings
of
the
senate
should
be
held
on
specified
days
previously
there
had
been
no
real
system
about
them
and
some
members
on
that
account
were
often
late
therefore
he
appointed
two
regular
monthly
councils
so
that
those
whom
the
law
summoned
should
be
under
compulsion
to
attend
and
in
order
that
no
other
excuse
for
their
absence
should
be
within
their
power
he
commanded
that
no
court
or
other
meeting
which
required
their
attention
should
be
held
at
that
time
he
made
provision
with
respect
to
the
number
necessary
for
ratifying
decrees
under
each
separate
category
to
put
it
briefly
and
he
increased
the
fines
imposed
upon
those
who
without
good
excuse
were
not
present
at
the
gatherings
inasmuch
as
many
such
offences
had
generally
gone
unpunished
owing
to
the
large
number
of
those
who
had
incurred
penalties
he
commanded
that
if
many
should
do
this
they
should
draw
lots
and
every
fifth
one
to
draw
a
lot
should
be
held
liable
to
the
names
of
all
the
senators
he
had
recorded
on
a
white
tablet
and
conspicuously
posted
from
the
beginning
made
by
him
this
is
now
annually
done
intention
in
doing
it
was
to
make
it
absolutely
necessary
for
them
to
come
together
sometimes
by
some
accident
not
so
many
might
assemble
as
a
special
case
demanded
this
would
be
known
because
except
on
such
days
as
the
emperor
himself
might
be
present
the
number
of
those
in
attendance
was
both
at
this
time
and
later
carefully
ascertained
and
with
a
great
degree
of
accuracy
under
these
circumstances
they
would
deliberate
and
their
decision
would
be
recorded
but
it
was
not
final
was
not
ratified
instead
was
declared
in
order
that
their
might
be
evident
for
such
is
the
force
of
this
word
to
translate
the
term
into
greek
by
a
single
expression
is
not
possible
this
same
custom
prevailed
in
case
they
ever
assembled
through
haste
in
an
irregular
place
or
on
a
day
that
was
not
fitting
or
without
a
legal
summons
or
if
because
of
the
opposition
of
tribunes
a
decree
could
not
be
passed
but
their
opinion
was
not
to
be
concealed
later
ratification
was
granted
according
to
ancestral
precedent
to
the
resolution
in
question
and
the
latter
obtained
the
name
of
this
method
strictly
observed
for
an
extremely
long
period
by
the
men
of
old
time
has
in
a
already
become
null
and
void
as
also
the
prerogative
of
the
prætors
for
the
latter
were
indignant
that
they
might
bring
no
proposition
before
the
senate
although
they
ranked
above
the
tribunes
in
dignity
and
they
received
from
augustus
the
right
of
doing
so
but
in
the
course
of
time
it
was
taken
away
from
them
again
these
and
other
laws
which
he
at
this
time
enacted
he
inscribed
on
white
tablets
and
submitted
to
the
senate
before
taking
any
final
action
with
regard
to
them
and
he
allowed
the
senators
to
read
each
one
the
articles
separately
his
object
being
that
if
any
provision
did
not
please
them
or
if
they
could
suggest
anything
better
they
might
speak
he
was
very
desirous
of
being
democratic
and
once
when
one
of
the
companions
of
his
campaigns
asked
him
to
aid
him
in
the
capacity
of
advocate
at
first
he
pretended
to
be
busy
and
bade
one
of
his
friends
serve
as
advocate
when
however
the
petitioner
grew
angry
and
said
but
as
often
as
you
needed
my
assistance
i
did
not
send
somebody
else
to
you
in
place
of
myself
but
in
person
i
encountered
dangers
everywhere
in
your
behalf
the
emperor
then
entered
the
courtroom
and
pled
his
cause
he
also
stood
by
a
friend
of
his
who
was
defendant
in
a
suit
having
first
communicated
this
very
purpose
to
the
senate
he
saved
the
friend
but
was
so
far
from
being
angry
at
his
accuser
although
the
latter
spoke
most
bluntly
that
when
he
had
to
undergo
a
scrutiny
regarding
his
morals
the
emperor
acquitted
him
saying
that
his
bluntness
was
a
necessary
thing
on
account
of
the
baseness
of
the
mass
of
mankind
augustus
indeed
punished
others
who
were
reported
to
be
conspiring
against
their
sovereign
he
had
quæstors
hold
office
in
the
coast
districts
near
the
city
and
in
certain
other
parts
of
italy
and
this
he
did
for
several
years
yet
at
this
time
he
was
unwilling
as
i
have
remarked
to
enter
the
city
on
account
of
drusus
death
u
but
the
next
year
in
which
asinius
gallus
and
graius
marcius
were
consuls
he
came
back
and
carried
the
laurel
contrary
to
custom
into
the
temple
of
jupiter
feretrius
no
festival
did
he
celebrate
over
his
achievements
thinking
that
he
had
lost
far
more
in
the
death
of
drusus
than
he
had
gained
by
the
victories
the
consuls
carried
out
the
program
usual
on
such
occasions
and
set
some
of
the
captives
to
fighting
with
one
another
later
when
they
and
the
rest
of
the
officials
were
accused
of
having
been
appointed
by
means
of
some
bribery
he
did
not
investigate
the
case
but
pretended
not
even
to
know
of
it
he
did
not
like
to
visit
punishment
on
any
of
them
or
to
pardon
them
if
they
were
convicted
but
from
office
seekers
he
demanded
before
the
elections
a
deposit
of
money
as
a
guarantee
that
they
would
resort
to
no
such
methods
on
pain
of
forfeiting
what
they
had
paid
in
this
course
all
as
it
was
not
permissible
for
a
slave
to
be
tortured
for
evidence
against
his
master
he
ordered
that
as
often
as
the
necessity
for
such
a
course
should
arise
the
slave
should
be
sold
either
to
the
state
or
to
him
in
order
that
being
now
the
property
of
some
one
else
than
the
man
on
trial
he
might
be
examined
some
found
fault
with
this
because
the
law
was
to
be
invalidated
by
the
change
of
masters
but
others
declared
it
to
be
necessary
because
many
under
the
previous
arrangement
united
to
take
advantage
of
the
loophole
offered
and
to
get
the
offices
augustus
after
this
although
as
he
said
he
was
minded
to
lay
aside
the
supreme
power
since
the
second
period
had
run
out
resumed
it
again
with
a
show
of
reluctance
and
made
a
campaign
against
the
celtæ
he
himself
remained
behind
on
roman
territory
but
tiberius
crossed
the
rhine
the
barbarians
in
dread
of
him
all
except
the
sugambri
made
overtures
for
peace
but
they
did
not
obtain
their
request
at
this
time
for
augustus
refused
to
conclude
a
truce
with
them
if
they
lacked
the
sugambri
nor
did
they
later
to
be
sure
the
sugambri
too
sent
envoys
but
they
failed
completely
to
accomplish
anything
on
the
contrary
all
of
them
a
numerous
and
distinguished
band
met
an
untimely
end
augustus
arrested
them
and
placed
them
in
various
cities
they
took
this
very
much
amiss
and
committed
suicide
the
tribes
then
were
quiet
for
a
time
but
later
they
amply
requited
the
romans
for
the
besides
doing
this
augustus
granted
money
to
the
soldiers
not
as
to
victors
though
he
himself
had
taken
the
name
of
imperator
and
had
given
it
to
tiberius
but
because
this
was
the
first
time
that
they
had
gaius
appearing
in
the
exercises
with
them
he
advanced
tiberius
to
the
position
of
imperator
in
place
of
drusus
and
besides
exalting
him
with
that
title
appointed
him
consul
once
more
according
to
the
ancient
custom
he
had
a
written
notice
bulletined
for
the
public
benefit
before
tiberius
entered
upon
the
office
and
he
furthermore
accorded
him
the
solemnity
of
a
triumph
augustus
himself
did
not
wish
to
hold
it
but
obtained
the
privilege
of
a
perpetually
upon
his
birthday
he
enlarged
the
pomerium
and
renamed
the
month
called
sextilis
augustus
the
people
generally
wanted
september
to
be
so
named
because
he
had
been
born
in
it
but
he
preferred
the
other
month
in
which
he
had
first
been
appointed
consul
and
had
conquered
in
many
great
battles
it
was
in
these
things
that
he
took
pride
the
death
of
mæcenas
caused
him
grief
he
had
enjoyed
many
kind
services
at
his
hands
for
which
reason
he
had
entrusted
him
though
but
a
knight
with
the
care
of
the
city
for
a
long
time
but
especially
was
his
ministry
of
use
when
the
emperor
passion
became
nearly
uncontrollable
mæcenas
was
then
able
to
banish
his
anger
and
to
lead
him
into
a
gentler
frame
of
mind
here
is
an
instance
mæcenas
once
found
his
patron
holding
court
and
seeing
that
would
undoubtedly
condemn
many
persons
to
death
he
undertook
to
push
through
the
bystanders
and
get
finding
this
impossible
he
wrote
on
a
tablet
pray
desist
now
executioner
making
as
if
it
contained
something
different
he
threw
it
into
the
lap
of
augustus
and
the
latter
imposed
no
death
sentences
but
immediately
rose
and
left
the
emperor
was
not
displeased
at
such
hints
but
rather
glad
of
them
because
whatever
excess
of
anger
he
felt
by
reason
of
his
own
nature
and
the
press
of
affairs
he
was
able
to
tone
down
with
the
aid
of
his
friend
frank
this
also
is
a
very
great
proof
of
mæcenas
excellence
that
he
made
himself
liked
by
augustus
in
spite
of
resisting
his
projects
and
pleased
all
the
people
though
he
had
tremendous
influence
with
the
emperor
so
that
he
could
bestow
offices
and
honors
upon
many
men
he
did
not
lose
his
head
but
continued
to
the
end
of
his
life
in
the
equestrian
class
for
all
these
reasons
augustus
missed
him
greatly
and
he
was
affected
by
the
fact
that
his
minister
though
irritated
about
his
own
wife
had
left
him
as
his
heir
and
had
put
all
his
property
save
a
very
small
amount
in
his
hands
to
give
to
his
friends
or
not
as
he
saw
fit
such
was
the
character
of
mæcenas
and
such
his
treatment
of
augustus
he
was
the
first
to
construct
a
swimming
pool
of
warm
water
in
the
city
and
the
first
to
devise
signs
for
letters
to
facilitate
speed
a
system
which
through
aquila
a
freedman
he
taught
to
a
number
tiberius
on
the
first
day
that
he
began
the
consulship
with
gnæus
piso
convened
the
senate
in
the
octavium
because
it
was
outside
the
pomerium
after
assigning
himself
the
duty
of
repairing
the
temple
of
concord
in
order
that
he
might
inscribe
upon
it
his
own
name
and
that
of
drusus
he
held
his
triumph
and
in
company
with
his
mother
dedicated
the
precinct
of
livia
he
himself
entertained
the
senate
on
the
capitol
and
she
the
women
privately
not
much
later
as
there
was
some
disturbance
in
germany
he
took
the
field
the
festival
held
in
honor
of
the
return
of
augustus
was
managed
by
gaius
together
with
piso
in
his
place
the
campus
agrippæ
except
the
portico
and
the
diribitorium
augustus
himself
made
public
property
the
latter
was
the
largest
house
ever
constructed
under
a
single
roof
now
the
whole
top
of
it
has
been
taken
off
because
it
could
not
be
put
together
solidly
again
and
the
edifice
stands
wide
open
to
the
sky
agrippa
had
left
it
still
in
the
process
of
building
and
it
was
completed
at
this
time
the
portico
in
the
plain
which
polla
his
sister
who
had
also
decorated
the
was
making
was
not
yet
finished
meantime
funeral
combats
in
honor
of
agrippa
were
given
all
except
augustus
wearing
dark
clothing
and
even
his
sons
the
same
and
there
were
both
duels
and
contests
of
groups
they
were
held
in
the
sæpta
out
of
honor
to
agrippa
and
because
many
of
the
structures
surrounding
the
forum
had
been
burned
the
blame
for
the
fire
was
laid
upon
the
debtor
class
and
they
were
suspected
of
having
set
it
with
the
purpose
of
having
some
of
their
debts
remitted
when
they
appeared
to
have
lost
considerable
they
obtained
nothing
however
the
lanes
at
this
time
were
provided
with
certain
supervisors
from
among
the
people
whom
we
call
road
commissioners
they
were
allowed
to
use
official
dress
and
two
lictors
just
in
the
places
where
they
had
jurisdiction
and
on
certain
days
and
they
were
given
charge
of
the
body
of
slaves
which
previously
had
accompanied
the
ædiles
to
save
buildings
that
were
set
afire
an
arrangement
still
continued
to
the
present
day
they
together
with
the
tribunes
and
prætors
were
by
lot
appointed
to
have
charge
of
the
entire
city
which
was
divided
into
fourteen
these
were
all
the
events
of
that
year
for
nothing
worthy
of
mention
happened
in
germany
the
year
following
which
marked
the
consulship
of
gaius
antistius
and
lælius
balbus
augustus
was
displeased
to
see
that
gaius
and
lucius
who
were
being
brought
up
in
the
lap
of
sovereignty
did
not
carefully
imitate
his
ways
they
not
only
lived
too
luxuriously
but
showed
unseemly
audacity
lucius
once
entered
the
theatre
by
himself
and
became
the
center
of
attraction
of
the
whole
population
some
merely
let
him
engross
their
thoughts
and
others
openly
paid
court
to
him
this
treatment
made
him
more
arrogant
and
among
his
other
doings
he
proposed
for
consul
gaius
who
was
not
yet
a
iuvenis
his
father
however
expressed
the
earnest
wish
that
no
such
complication
of
circumstances
might
arise
as
once
occurred
in
his
own
case
that
any
one
younger
than
twenty
should
be
consul
when
the
people
still
remained
urgent
he
then
said
that
a
man
ought
to
receive
this
office
at
time
when
he
would
not
be
liable
to
error
himself
and
could
resist
the
passions
of
the
populace
after
that
he
gave
gaius
a
priesthood
with
the
right
of
attendance
in
the
senate
and
of
beholding
spectacles
and
sitting
at
banquets
with
that
body
and
wishing
in
some
way
to
rebuke
them
still
more
severely
he
bestowed
upon
tiberius
the
tribunician
authority
for
five
years
and
assigned
to
him
armenia
which
was
becoming
estranged
since
the
death
of
tigranes
the
result
was
that
he
was
soon
at
odds
with
the
people
and
tiberius
though
without
effecting
anything
the
people
felt
that
they
had
been
slighted
and
tiberius
feared
their
anger
he
was
however
soon
sent
to
rhodes
on
the
pretext
that
he
needed
some
education
and
he
took
not
even
his
entire
retinue
to
say
nothing
of
others
that
so
his
appearance
and
his
deeds
might
drop
out
of
their
minds
the
trip
he
made
as
a
private
person
except
in
so
far
as
he
compelled
the
parians
to
sell
him
the
statue
of
vesta
that
it
might
be
placed
in
the
temple
of
concord
when
he
reached
the
island
he
neither
behaved
at
all
nor
spoke
in
an
overweening
this
is
the
truest
reason
for
his
foreign
journey
there
is
also
a
story
current
that
he
did
this
on
account
of
his
wife
julia
because
he
could
no
longer
endure
her
at
any
rate
she
was
left
behind
at
rome
others
have
said
that
he
was
angry
at
not
having
been
designated
cæsar
others
still
that
he
was
driven
out
by
augustus
being
accused
of
plotting
against
the
latter
children
but
that
his
departure
was
not
for
the
sake
of
education
nor
because
he
was
displeased
at
the
decrees
passed
became
plain
from
many
of
his
subsequent
actions
and
especially
through
his
immediately
opening
his
will
at
that
time
and
reading
it
to
his
mother
and
to
augustus
but
all
possible
conjectures
were
made
the
following
year
augustus
in
the
course
of
his
twelfth
consulship
placed
gaius
among
the
iuvenes
and
at
the
same
time
brought
him
before
the
senate
declared
him
princeps
luventutis
and
allowed
him
to
become
cavalry
commander
and
after
the
elapse
of
a
year
lucius
also
obtained
all
the
honors
that
had
been
granted
to
his
brother
gaius
on
an
occasion
when
the
populace
had
gathered
and
were
asking
that
some
reforms
be
instituted
when
indeed
they
had
sent
for
this
purpose
the
tribunes
to
augustus
lucius
came
and
deliberated
with
them
about
their
demands
and
at
this
all
were
pleased
augustus
limited
the
number
of
the
populace
to
be
supplied
with
grain
something
previously
left
vague
to
twenty
myriads
and
as
some
say
he
gave
each
one
sixty
to
mars
and
that
he
himself
and
his
grandsons
as
often
as
they
pleased
and
those
who
were
passing
from
the
classification
of
children
and
were
being
registered
among
the
iuvenes
should
invariably
resort
thither
that
magistrates
being
despatched
to
offices
abroad
should
make
that
their
that
the
senate
should
there
declare
their
votes
in
regard
to
the
granting
of
triumphs
and
the
victors
celebrating
them
should
devote
to
this
mars
their
sceptre
and
their
crown
that
such
victors
and
all
others
who
might
obtain
triumphal
honors
should
have
their
likenesses
in
bronze
erected
in
the
forum
that
in
case
military
standards
captured
by
the
enemy
were
ever
recovered
they
should
be
placed
in
the
temple
that
a
festival
of
the
god
should
be
celebrated
near
the
scalæ
by
the
persons
successively
occupying
the
office
of
præfectus
alae
that
a
nail
should
be
driven
for
his
glory
by
those
acting
as
censors
that
senators
have
the
right
to
undertake
the
work
of
furnishing
the
horses
that
were
to
compete
in
the
equestrian
contest
as
well
as
the
general
care
of
the
temple
precisely
as
had
been
provided
by
law
in
the
case
of
apollo
and
in
the
case
of
jupiter
capitolinus
these
matters
settled
augustus
dedicated
that
spacious
hall
yet
to
gaius
and
to
lucius
he
gave
once
and
for
all
powers
to
officiate
at
all
similar
consecrations
on
the
strength
of
a
kind
of
consular
authority
founded
on
precedent
that
they
were
to
use
they
too
directed
the
on
this
occasion
and
their
brother
agrippa
took
part
with
the
children
of
the
leading
families
in
the
troy
equestrian
games
two
hundred
and
sixty
lions
were
slaughtered
in
the
hippodrome
there
was
a
gladiatorial
combat
in
the
sæpta
and
a
naval
battle
of
persians
and
athenians
was
given
on
the
spot
where
even
at
the
present
day
some
relics
of
it
are
still
exhibited
the
above
were
the
names
applied
to
the
parties
engaged
and
the
athenians
as
of
old
came
out
victorious
in
the
course
of
the
spectacle
he
let
water
into
the
flaminian
hippodrome
and
crocodiles
were
there
cut
in
pieces
however
augustus
did
not
serve
as
consul
every
day
continuously
but
after
holding
office
a
little
while
he
gave
the
title
of
the
consulship
to
another
these
were
the
exercises
in
honor
of
mars
to
augustus
himself
a
sacred
contest
was
offered
in
neapolis
the
campanian
city
nominally
because
he
had
helped
it
rise
when
it
was
prostrated
by
earthquake
and
by
fire
but
in
reality
because
the
inhabitants
alone
of
their
neighbors
were
enthusiastic
over
greek
customs
and
he
also
received
the
title
of
father
with
binding
force
for
previously
he
was
merely
spoken
of
by
that
name
and
no
decree
had
been
passed
moreover
it
was
now
that
for
the
first
time
he
appointed
two
pretorian
prefects
quintus
ostorius
scapula
and
publius
salvius
aper
this
term
prefect
is
the
word
which
i
too
shall
use
solely
to
designate
the
commanders
of
any
body
since
it
has
won
its
way
into
general
currency
likewise
pylades
the
dancer
conducted
certain
games
not
performing
any
manual
labor
in
connection
with
them
since
he
was
now
a
man
of
advanced
age
but
employing
the
insignia
of
office
and
authorizing
the
necessary
expenditures
similarly
the
prætor
quintus
crispinus
conducted
games
though
i
need
lay
no
emphasis
on
that
point
and
under
his
management
knights
and
women
of
families
not
unknown
to
fame
were
brought
into
the
orchestra
but
of
all
this
augustus
made
no
account
his
daughter
julia
however
proved
so
dissolute
that
she
held
revels
and
drinking
bouts
by
night
in
the
forum
and
on
the
very
rostra
when
at
last
he
found
this
out
he
was
exceedingly
enraged
he
had
guessed
before
that
she
did
not
lead
a
right
life
but
refused
to
believe
it
for
those
who
hold
supreme
power
are
acquainted
with
anything
better
than
with
their
own
affairs
their
own
deeds
do
not
go
undetected
by
their
associates
but
they
are
not
fully
aware
of
the
latter
in
this
instance
when
he
learned
what
was
going
on
he
gave
way
to
such
violent
rage
that
he
could
not
keep
the
matter
to
himself
but
communicated
it
to
the
senate
as
a
result
she
was
banished
to
the
island
of
pandateria
near
campania
and
her
mother
scribonia
voluntarily
was
the
companion
of
her
voyage
of
the
men
who
enjoyed
her
favors
iullus
antonius
on
the
ground
that
his
conduct
was
prompted
by
designs
upon
the
monarchy
was
put
to
death
along
with
others
prominent
persons
the
remainder
were
banished
to
islands
and
since
there
was
a
tribune
among
them
he
was
not
tried
till
he
had
completed
his
term
of
office
many
other
women
too
were
accused
of
similar
behavior
but
the
emperor
would
not
permit
all
the
suits
he
set
a
definite
time
and
forbade
investigation
of
what
had
occurred
previous
to
that
in
the
case
of
his
daughter
he
would
show
no
mercy
urging
that
he
would
rather
have
been
phoebe
father
than
hers
but
the
rest
he
spared
now
phoebe
been
a
freedwoman
of
julia
and
the
companion
of
her
undertakings
and
had
already
caused
her
own
death
for
this
augustus
praised
her
gaius
captaincy
of
the
legions
on
the
ister
was
a
peaceful
period
he
fought
no
war
not
because
there
was
none
but
because
he
cultivated
ruling
in
quiet
and
safety
and
the
dangers
were
assigned
to
others
the
revolt
of
the
armenians
and
the
parthians
coöperation
with
them
kept
augustus
sorrowful
and
he
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
his
age
rendered
him
incapable
of
campaigning
tiberius
as
stated
had
already
withdrawn
he
could
not
venture
to
send
any
other
influential
man
and
gaius
and
lucius
were
as
it
happened
young
and
inexperienced
in
affairs
still
under
the
prod
of
necessity
he
chose
gaius
gave
him
the
proconsular
authority
and
a
wife
an
act
intended
to
increase
his
dignity
and
assigned
advisers
to
him
gaius
set
out
and
was
everywhere
received
with
marks
of
distinction
occupying
as
he
did
the
position
of
the
emperor
grandson
one
might
almost
say
son
and
tiberius
went
to
chios
and
paid
him
court
to
rid
himself
of
suspicion
he
humiliated
himself
and
groveled
at
the
feet
not
only
of
gaius
but
of
all
the
latter
associates
on
his
return
to
syria
after
no
great
successes
won
he
was
wounded
when
the
barbarians
heard
of
the
campaign
of
gaius
phrataces
sent
to
augustus
men
to
explain
what
had
occurred
and
asked
to
get
back
his
brothers
on
condition
of
accepting
peace
the
emperor
reply
addressed
simply
to
phrataces
without
the
title
of
king
directed
him
to
lay
aside
the
royal
name
and
withdraw
from
armenia
the
parthian
however
instead
of
being
cowed
at
this
wrote
back
in
a
generally
supercilious
tone
calling
himself
king
of
kings
but
the
other
only
cæsar
tigranes
did
not
at
once
send
any
envoys
but
when
artabazus
somewhat
later
fell
sick
and
died
he
despatched
a
letter
not
writing
the
name
king
in
it
and
asked
augustus
for
the
kingdom
influenced
by
these
considerations
and
in
fear
likewise
of
war
with
the
parthians
the
emperor
accepted
the
gifts
and
bade
him
go
with
good
hopes
to
meet
gaius
in
syria
other
party
from
egypt
that
campaigned
against
them
they
repulsed
and
did
not
yield
till
a
tribune
from
the
pretorian
guard
was
sent
against
them
he
in
progress
of
time
checked
their
incursions
and
for
a
long
period
no
senator
governed
the
cities
in
this
region
coincident
with
these
troubles
there
was
a
new
movement
on
the
part
of
the
celtæ
some
time
earlier
domitius
while
still
governing
the
regions
adjacent
to
the
ister
had
intercepted
the
hermunduri
a
tribe
that
for
some
unknown
reason
had
left
their
native
land
and
were
wandering
about
in
search
of
a
different
country
and
he
had
settled
them
in
a
portion
of
marcomania
next
encountering
no
opposition
he
had
crossed
the
albis
cemented
friendship
with
the
barbarians
on
the
other
side
and
set
up
an
altar
to
augustus
to
commemorate
the
event
just
now
he
had
transferred
his
position
to
the
rhine
where
in
pursuance
of
an
intention
to
have
his
subordinates
restore
certain
cheruscian
exiles
he
had
met
with
misfortune
and
had
caused
the
other
barbarians
likewise
to
concieve
a
contempt
for
the
romans
this
was
however
the
extent
of
his
operations
during
the
year
in
question
for
because
of
the
parthian
war
impending
no
chastisement
was
visited
upon
the
rebels
immediately
nevertheless
the
war
with
the
parthians
did
not
materialize
phrataces
heard
that
gaius
was
in
syria
equipped
with
consular
powers
and
was
furthermore
uneasy
about
home
interests
in
which
even
previously
he
had
failed
to
discern
a
friendly
feeling
hence
he
hastened
to
effect
a
reconciliation
secured
on
the
proviso
that
he
himself
should
depart
from
armenia
and
his
brothers
remain
over
seas
now
the
armenians
fell
into
conflict
with
the
romans
the
following
year
in
which
publius
vinicius
and
publius
varus
were
consuls
the
restraining
influence
of
the
fact
that
tigranes
had
perished
in
some
barbarian
war
and
that
erato
had
resigned
the
sovereignty
was
nullified
as
soon
as
they
were
delivered
to
a
mede
ariobarzanes
who
had
once
come
to
the
romans
in
company
with
tiridates
they
accomplished
nothing
worthy
of
note
save
that
a
leader
named
addon
who
was
occupying
artagira
induced
gaius
to
come
close
up
to
the
wall
pretending
that
he
would
reveal
to
him
some
secrets
of
the
parthian
king
and
then
wounded
him
in
the
consequent
siege
he
maintained
a
prolonged
resistance
when
he
was
at
last
overthrown
not
only
augustus
but
gaius
too
assumed
the
title
of
imperator
and
armenia
passed
into
the
control
of
ariobarzanes
soon
after
the
latter
died
and
his
son
artabazus
received
it
as
the
gift
of
augustus
and
the
senate
gaius
fell
ill
from
the
wound
and
though
he
was
not
in
any
way
robust
and
the
condition
of
his
health
had
in
fact
injured
his
mind
he
now
grew
still
more
feeble
at
length
he
begged
leave
to
retire
to
private
life
and
it
was
his
wish
to
take
up
his
abode
somewhere
in
syria
augustus
in
the
depth
of
grief
communicated
his
desire
to
the
senate
and
urged
him
to
come
at
any
rate
to
italy
and
then
do
what
he
pleased
so
gaius
resigned
at
once
all
the
duties
of
his
office
and
took
a
coastwise
trading
vessel
to
lycia
where
at
limyra
he
breathed
his
last
prior
to
his
demise
the
spark
of
lucius
life
had
also
paled
he
too
was
being
given
practice
in
many
places
sent
now
here
now
there
and
he
was
wont
to
read
personally
the
letters
of
gaius
before
the
senate
so
often
as
he
was
present
his
death
was
due
to
a
sudden
illness
in
connection
with
both
these
cases
therefore
suspicion
rested
upon
livia
and
particularly
because
the
return
of
tiberius
from
rhodes
to
rome
occurred
at
this
time
as
for
him
he
was
so
extremely
well
versed
in
the
art
of
divination
by
the
stars
having
with
him
thrasyllus
who
was
a
past
master
of
all
astrology
that
he
had
understood
accurately
what
was
fated
both
for
himself
and
for
them
and
the
story
goes
that
once
in
rhodes
he
was
about
to
push
thrasyllus
from
the
walls
because
the
latter
was
the
only
one
aware
of
all
he
had
in
mind
observing
however
that
his
intended
victim
looked
gloomy
he
asked
him
why
his
face
was
overcast
when
the
other
replied
that
he
suspected
some
danger
he
was
surprised
and
gave
up
his
murderous
designs
thrasyllus
had
such
a
clear
knowledge
of
all
things
that
when
he
descried
approaching
afar
off
the
boat
which
brought
to
tiberius
the
message
from
his
mother
and
augustus
to
return
to
rome
he
told
him
in
advance
what
news
it
would
bring
the
bodies
of
lucius
and
of
gaius
were
brought
to
rome
by
the
military
tribunes
and
by
the
chief
men
of
each
city
the
targes
and
the
golden
spears
which
they
had
received
from
the
knights
on
entering
the
class
of
iuvenes
were
set
up
in
the
augustus
was
once
called
master
by
the
people
but
he
not
only
forbade
that
any
one
should
use
this
form
of
address
to
him
but
took
very
good
care
in
every
way
to
enforce
his
command
when
his
third
period
had
been
accomplished
he
then
accepted
the
rulership
for
the
fourth
time
of
course
under
compulsion
he
had
become
milder
through
age
and
more
hesitating
in
regard
to
offending
any
of
the
senators
and
now
wished
to
have
no
differences
with
any
of
them
for
lending
for
three
years
to
such
as
needed
it
fifteen
hundred
myriads
of
denarii
without
interest
he
was
praised
and
reverenced
by
all
once
when
a
fire
destroyed
the
palace
and
many
persons
offered
him
large
amounts
he
would
take
nothing
except
an
aureus
from
the
various
peoples
and
a
denarius
from
single
individuals
the
name
which
i
give
here
is
a
local
term
for
a
piece
of
money
worth
denarii
some
of
the
greeks
also
whose
books
we
read
for
acquiring
a
pure
attic
style
give
it
this
name
when
augustus
had
restored
his
dwelling
he
made
all
of
it
public
property
either
because
of
the
contributions
made
by
the
people
or
because
he
was
high
priest
and
wished
to
live
in
a
building
both
private
and
public
the
people
urged
augustus
very
strongly
to
rescind
the
sentence
of
exile
passed
upon
his
daughter
but
he
answered
that
fire
would
mix
with
water
before
she
should
be
brought
back
and
the
populace
did
throw
a
good
deal
of
fire
into
the
tiber
for
the
time
being
they
accomplished
nothing
but
later
they
brought
such
pressure
to
bear
that
she
was
at
last
moved
from
the
island
to
the
mainland
and
later
the
outbreak
of
war
with
the
celtæ
found
augustus
worn
out
in
body
by
reason
of
old
age
and
sickness
and
incapable
of
taking
the
field
yielding
then
partly
to
the
requirements
of
the
situation
and
partly
to
the
persuasions
of
julia
who
had
already
been
restored
from
banishment
he
both
adopted
tiberius
and
sent
him
out
against
the
celtæ
granting
him
the
tribunician
authority
for
ten
years
yet
suspecting
that
he
might
lose
his
head
and
fearing
a
possible
insurrection
he
adopted
for
him
also
his
nephew
germanicus
though
tiberius
himself
had
a
son
after
this
he
took
courage
and
feeling
that
he
had
successors
and
supporters
he
became
desirous
to
organize
the
senate
once
more
so
he
nominated
the
ten
senators
whom
he
most
honored
and
appointed
three
of
them
selected
by
lot
to
be
scrutinizers
there
were
not
many
however
who
either
imposed
sentence
on
themselves
beforehand
permission
being
given
them
to
do
so
just
as
previously
or
were
retired
against
their
will
this
business
then
was
managed
by
others
the
emperor
himself
took
a
census
of
the
inhabitants
of
italy
possessing
property
valued
at
not
less
than
five
myriad
denarii
the
weaker
citizens
and
those
dwelling
outside
of
italy
he
did
not
compel
to
undergo
the
taking
of
a
census
for
he
feared
that
they
might
be
disturbed
and
show
insubordination
of
some
sort
and
in
order
that
he
might
not
seem
to
be
acting
in
the
capacity
of
censor
for
the
reason
i
mentioned
before
he
assumed
proconsular
powers
for
the
purpose
of
completing
the
census
and
accomplishing
the
purification
and
inasmuch
as
many
of
the
young
men
of
the
senatorial
class
and
of
the
equestrian
as
well
had
grown
poor
though
not
at
fault
for
it
themselves
he
made
up
to
most
of
them
the
required
amount
of
property
and
in
the
case
of
some
eighty
increased
it
to
thirty
myriads
since
also
many
were
giving
unrestricted
emancipation
to
their
slaves
he
directed
what
age
the
manumitter
and
likewise
the
person
to
be
liberated
by
him
must
have
reached
moreover
what
regulations
people
in
general
and
the
former
masters
should
observe
toward
those
made
freedmen
while
he
was
thus
occupied
plots
were
formed
against
him
and
notably
one
by
gnæus
cornelius
a
son
of
the
daughter
of
pompey
the
great
for
some
time
the
emperor
was
a
prey
to
great
perplexity
not
wishing
to
kill
the
men
for
he
saw
that
no
greater
safety
would
be
his
by
their
destruction
nor
yet
to
let
them
go
for
fear
this
might
attract
others
to
conspire
against
him
while
he
was
in
a
dilemma
as
to
what
he
should
do
and
could
not
be
free
from
anxiety
by
day
nor
from
terror
by
night
livia
one
day
said
to
him
what
is
this
husband
why
is
it
you
do
not
sleep
wife
answered
augustus
who
could
be
even
to
the
slightest
degree
free
from
care
that
has
so
many
enemies
and
is
so
constantly
the
object
of
plots
of
one
set
of
men
or
another
do
you
not
see
how
many
are
attacking
both
me
and
our
sovereignty
the
vengeance
meted
out
to
those
found
guilty
does
not
retard
them
quite
the
contrary
as
if
they
were
pressing
forward
to
do
some
noble
action
the
rest
also
hasten
to
perish
similarly
livia
hearing
this
said
that
you
should
be
the
object
of
plots
is
not
remarkable
nor
is
it
contrary
to
human
nature
having
so
large
an
empire
you
must
do
many
things
and
naturally
you
cause
grief
to
not
a
few
people
a
ruler
can
not
please
all
on
the
contrary
even
an
exceedingly
upright
sovereign
must
inevitably
make
foes
of
many
persons
for
those
who
wish
to
be
unjust
are
many
more
than
those
who
act
justly
and
their
desires
it
is
impossible
to
satisfy
even
among
such
as
possess
a
certain
excellence
some
yearn
for
many
great
rewards
which
they
can
not
obtain
and
some
chafe
because
they
are
inferior
to
others
so
both
of
them
find
fault
with
the
ruler
from
this
you
can
see
that
it
is
impossible
to
avoid
evil
and
furthermore
that
of
all
the
attacks
made
none
is
upon
you
but
all
upon
your
position
of
supremacy
if
you
were
a
private
citizen
no
one
would
willingly
do
you
any
harm
unless
he
had
previously
received
some
injury
but
for
the
supremacy
and
for
the
good
things
that
it
contains
all
yearn
and
those
who
occupy
any
post
of
influence
far
more
than
their
inferiors
it
is
the
nature
of
wicked
men
who
have
very
little
sense
to
do
so
it
is
implanted
in
their
dispositions
just
like
anything
else
and
it
is
impossible
by
either
persuasion
or
compulsion
to
remove
such
a
bent
from
some
of
them
there
is
no
law
or
fear
stronger
than
natural
tendencies
reflect
on
this
and
do
not
take
the
offences
of
others
so
hard
but
keep
yourself
and
your
supremacy
carefully
guarded
that
we
may
hold
it
safely
not
by
virtue
of
inflicting
severe
punishments
but
by
means
of
strict
watchfulness
to
this
augustus
replied
wife
i
too
know
that
nothing
great
is
ever
free
from
envy
and
plots
least
of
all
sole
power
we
should
be
peers
of
the
gods
if
we
did
not
have
troubles
and
cares
and
fears
beyond
all
private
individuals
but
to
me
it
is
also
a
source
of
grief
that
this
is
inevitably
so
and
that
no
cure
for
it
can
be
found
yet
said
livia
since
some
men
are
so
constituted
as
to
want
to
do
wrong
in
any
event
let
us
guard
against
them
we
have
many
soldiers
who
protect
us
some
marshaled
against
foreign
foes
and
others
about
your
person
and
a
large
retinue
so
that
by
their
help
we
may
live
safely
both
at
home
and
abroad
i
do
not
need
said
augustus
interrupting
to
state
that
many
men
on
many
occasions
have
perished
at
the
hands
of
their
immediate
associates
for
in
addition
to
other
disadvantages
this
too
is
a
most
distressing
thing
in
monarchies
that
we
fear
not
only
enemies
like
other
people
but
also
our
friends
many
more
rulers
have
been
plotted
against
by
such
persons
than
by
those
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
this
is
to
be
expected
since
the
inner
circle
is
with
the
potentate
day
and
night
exercising
and
eating
and
he
has
to
take
food
and
drink
that
they
have
prepared
moreover
against
acknowledged
enemies
you
can
array
these
very
men
but
against
the
latter
themselves
there
is
no
one
else
to
employ
as
an
ally
to
us
therefore
the
whole
time
through
solitude
is
dreadful
company
dreadful
to
be
unguarded
is
terrifying
but
most
terrifying
are
the
guards
themselves
enemies
are
difficult
to
deal
with
but
still
greater
difficulties
are
presented
by
our
friends
they
must
all
be
called
friends
whether
they
are
such
or
not
but
even
if
one
should
find
them
most
reliable
even
so
one
may
not
trust
one
self
in
their
company
with
a
clear
carefree
unsuspecting
heart
this
then
and
the
fact
that
it
is
requisite
to
take
measures
of
defence
against
ordinary
conspirators
make
the
situation
overwhelmingly
dreadful
for
to
be
always
compelled
to
be
inflicting
punishment
and
chastisement
upon
somebody
is
highly
repugnant
to
men
of
character
you
are
right
answered
livia
and
i
have
some
advice
to
give
you
at
least
if
you
prove
willing
to
receive
it
and
willing
not
to
censure
me
that
woman
as
i
am
i
dare
to
make
suggestions
to
you
which
no
one
else
even
of
your
most
intimate
friends
would
venture
and
this
is
not
through
any
lack
of
knowledge
on
their
part
but
because
they
are
not
bold
enough
to
speak
say
on
rejoined
augustus
and
let
us
have
it
i
will
tell
you
continued
livia
without
hesitation
because
i
share
your
comforts
and
adversities
and
while
you
are
safe
i
myself
hold
dominion
day
by
day
whereas
if
you
come
to
any
harm
which
heaven
forbid
i
shall
perish
with
you
well
then
human
nature
persuades
some
to
sin
under
any
conditions
and
there
is
no
device
for
controlling
it
when
it
has
once
started
toward
any
goal
what
seems
good
to
persons
not
to
rehearse
the
vices
of
the
masses
at
once
induces
very
many
of
them
to
do
wrong
the
boast
of
birth
and
pride
of
wealth
greatness
of
honor
audacity
founded
on
bravery
and
conceit
due
to
authority
bring
shipwreck
to
not
a
few
there
is
no
making
nobility
ignoble
bravery
cowardly
or
prudence
foolish
it
is
impossible
nor
again
is
it
to
curtail
men
abundance
or
to
strike
down
ambitions
where
conduct
has
been
correct
that
is
iniquitous
that
he
who
is
on
the
defensive
and
anticipates
others
movements
should
incur
injury
and
ill
repute
is
inevitable
come
let
us
change
our
policy
and
spare
some
of
them
to
me
it
seems
far
more
feasible
to
set
things
right
by
kindness
than
by
harshness
not
only
are
those
who
grant
pardon
loved
by
the
objects
of
their
clemency
who
strive
to
repay
the
favor
but
all
others
both
respect
and
reverence
them
and
will
not
readily
endure
to
see
harm
done
to
them
sovereigns
however
who
maintain
an
inexorable
anger
not
only
are
hated
by
those
who
have
aught
to
fear
but
cause
uneasiness
to
all
the
rest
as
a
result
men
plot
against
them
to
avoid
meeting
an
untimely
fate
do
you
not
notice
that
physicians
very
rarely
have
recourse
to
cutting
and
burning
wishing
to
avoid
aggravating
a
disease
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
soothe
and
cure
by
means
of
fomentations
and
mild
drugs
do
not
think
that
because
those
ailments
have
to
do
with
the
body
and
these
with
the
mind
that
they
are
essentially
different
very
many
experiences
of
the
body
are
similar
in
a
way
to
what
goes
on
in
the
souls
of
men
no
matter
how
bodiless
the
latter
may
be
the
soul
contracts
under
the
influence
of
fear
and
expands
under
that
of
wrath
pain
humiliates
men
and
audacity
puffs
them
up
the
correspondences
then
are
very
close
and
therefore
both
kinds
of
trouble
need
treatments
which
are
much
alike
a
gentle
speech
uttered
to
a
man
causes
all
his
unruliness
to
subside
just
as
a
harsh
one
provokes
to
anger
even
an
person
the
granting
of
pardon
melts
the
most
audacious
just
as
punishment
irritates
the
most
mild
acts
of
violence
inflame
all
men
in
every
instance
even
though
such
measures
may
be
thoroughly
just
but
considerate
treatment
mollifies
them
hence
one
would
more
readily
brave
great
dangers
through
persuasion
and
voluntarily
than
under
compulsion
such
is
the
inherent
unalterable
quality
of
both
methods
of
behavior
that
even
among
brute
beasts
that
have
no
mind
many
of
the
strongest
and
fiercest
are
domesticated
by
petting
and
are
subdued
by
coaxing
whereas
many
of
the
most
cowardly
and
weak
are
made
unmanageable
and
maddened
by
cruelties
and
terrors
i
am
not
saying
that
we
must
spare
absolutely
all
wrongdoers
for
we
must
cut
out
of
the
way
the
daredevil
and
busybody
the
man
of
evil
nature
and
evil
devices
who
gives
himself
up
to
an
unyielding
persistent
baseness
just
as
we
treat
parts
of
the
body
that
are
quite
incurable
but
of
the
rest
who
err
through
youth
or
ignorance
or
a
misunderstanding
or
some
other
chance
some
purposely
and
others
unwillingly
it
is
proper
to
admonish
some
with
words
to
bring
others
to
their
senses
by
threats
and
to
handle
still
others
with
moderation
in
some
different
way
precisely
as
in
other
matters
all
men
impose
upon
some
greater
and
upon
others
lesser
punishments
so
far
as
these
persons
are
concerned
you
may
employ
moderation
without
danger
inflicting
upon
some
the
penalty
of
banishment
upon
others
that
of
loss
of
political
rights
upon
still
others
a
money
fine
you
may
also
place
some
of
them
in
country
districts
or
in
certain
cities
in
the
past
a
few
have
been
brought
to
their
senses
by
missing
what
they
hoped
for
by
failing
to
secure
what
they
aimed
at
a
degradation
in
seats
and
factional
disputes
involving
disgrace
as
well
as
being
injured
or
terrified
before
they
could
make
a
move
has
improved
not
a
few
yet
one
well
born
and
courageous
would
prefer
to
die
rather
than
to
have
any
such
experience
as
a
result
vengeance
would
become
not
easier
for
the
plotters
but
more
difficult
and
we
should
be
able
to
live
in
safety
since
not
a
word
could
be
said
against
us
at
present
we
are
thought
to
kill
many
through
anger
many
because
of
a
desire
for
their
money
others
through
fear
of
their
bravery
and
a
great
many
others
on
account
of
jealousy
of
their
excellence
no
one
will
readily
believe
that
a
person
possessing
so
great
an
authority
and
power
can
seriously
be
the
object
of
the
plots
of
any
unarmed
individual
some
talk
as
above
and
others
say
that
we
hear
a
great
many
lies
and
foolishly
pay
heed
to
many
of
them
believing
them
true
they
assert
that
those
who
spy
into
and
overhear
doubtful
matters
concoct
many
falsehoods
some
being
influenced
by
enmity
others
by
wrath
some
because
they
can
get
money
from
their
foes
others
because
they
can
get
no
money
from
the
same
persons
and
further
that
they
report
not
only
the
fact
of
certain
persons
having
committed
suspicious
actions
or
intending
to
commit
them
but
also
how
a
said
and
b
hearing
it
was
silent
how
one
man
laughed
and
somebody
else
wept
i
could
cite
innumerable
other
details
of
like
nature
which
no
matter
how
true
they
were
are
no
business
for
free
men
to
concern
themselves
about
or
report
to
you
if
they
went
unnoticed
they
would
do
you
no
harm
but
when
heard
they
might
irritate
you
even
against
your
will
and
that
ought
by
no
means
to
happen
especially
in
a
ruler
of
the
people
now
many
believe
that
from
this
cause
large
numbers
unjustly
perish
some
without
a
trial
and
others
by
some
unwarranted
condemnation
of
a
court
they
will
not
admit
that
the
evidence
given
or
statements
made
under
torture
or
any
similar
proof
against
them
is
genuine
this
is
the
sort
of
talk
though
some
of
it
may
not
be
just
which
is
reported
in
the
case
of
practically
all
so
put
to
death
and
you
ought
augustus
to
be
free
not
only
from
injustice
but
from
the
appearance
of
it
it
is
sufficient
for
a
private
individual
to
avoid
irregular
conduct
but
it
behooves
a
ruler
to
incur
not
even
the
suspicion
of
it
you
are
the
leader
of
human
beings
not
of
beasts
and
the
only
way
you
can
make
them
really
friendly
to
you
is
by
persuading
them
by
every
means
and
constantly
without
a
break
that
you
will
wrong
no
one
either
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
a
man
can
be
forced
to
fear
another
but
he
has
to
be
persuaded
to
love
him
and
he
is
to
be
persuaded
by
the
good
treatment
he
himself
receives
and
the
benefits
he
sees
conferred
on
others
the
person
however
who
suspects
that
somebody
has
perished
unjustly
both
fears
that
he
may
some
day
meet
the
same
fate
and
is
compelled
to
hate
the
one
responsible
for
the
deed
and
to
be
hated
by
one
subjects
is
besides
containing
no
element
of
good
exceedingly
unprofitable
the
general
mass
of
people
feel
that
ordinary
individuals
must
defend
themselves
against
all
who
wrong
them
in
any
way
or
else
be
despised
and
consequently
oppressed
but
rulers
they
think
ought
to
prosecute
those
who
wrong
the
state
but
endure
those
who
are
thought
to
commit
offences
against
them
privately
rulers
can
not
be
harmed
by
disdain
or
assault
because
they
have
many
guardians
to
protect
them
when
i
hear
this
and
turn
my
attention
to
this
i
feel
inclined
to
tell
you
outright
to
put
no
one
to
death
for
any
such
reason
places
of
supremacy
are
established
for
the
preservation
of
subjects
to
prevent
them
from
being
injured
either
by
one
another
or
by
foreign
tribes
such
places
are
not
by
jupiter
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
rulers
themselves
to
hard
their
subjects
it
is
most
glorious
to
be
able
not
to
destroy
most
of
the
citizens
but
to
save
them
all
if
possible
it
is
right
to
educate
them
by
laws
and
favours
and
admonitions
that
they
may
be
and
further
to
watch
and
guard
them
so
that
even
if
they
wish
to
do
wrong
they
may
not
be
able
and
if
there
is
anything
ailing
we
must
cure
and
correct
it
in
some
way
in
order
that
there
may
be
no
entire
loss
to
endure
the
offences
of
the
multitude
is
a
task
requiring
great
prudence
and
force
if
any
one
should
simply
punish
all
of
them
as
they
deserve
before
he
knew
it
he
would
have
destroyed
the
majority
of
mankind
for
these
reasons
then
i
give
you
my
opinion
to
the
effect
that
you
should
not
inflict
the
death
penalty
for
any
such
error
but
bring
the
men
to
their
senses
in
some
other
way
so
that
they
will
not
again
do
anything
dangerous
what
crime
could
a
man
commit
shut
up
on
an
island
or
in
the
country
or
in
some
city
not
only
destitute
of
a
throng
of
servants
and
money
but
under
guard
if
it
be
necessary
if
the
enemy
were
anywhere
near
here
or
some
alien
force
had
dominion
over
this
sea
so
that
one
of
the
prisoners
might
escape
to
them
and
do
us
some
harm
or
if
again
there
were
strong
cities
in
italy
with
fortifications
and
weapons
so
that
if
a
man
seized
them
he
might
become
a
menace
to
us
that
would
be
a
different
story
but
all
towns
in
this
neighborhood
are
unarmed
and
lacking
any
walls
that
would
serve
in
war
and
the
enemy
is
removed
from
them
by
vast
distances
a
long
stretch
of
sea
and
a
journey
by
land
including
mountains
and
rivers
hard
to
cross
lie
between
them
and
us
why
then
should
one
fear
this
man
or
that
man
defenceless
private
citizens
here
in
the
middle
of
your
empire
and
enclosed
by
your
armed
forces
i
can
not
see
how
any
one
could
conceive
such
a
notion
or
how
the
maddest
madman
could
accomplish
anything
with
these
premises
therefore
let
us
give
the
idea
a
trial
the
discontented
will
soon
themselves
change
their
ways
and
bring
about
an
improvement
in
others
you
notice
that
cornelius
is
both
of
good
birth
and
renowned
this
matter
has
to
be
reasoned
out
in
a
human
fashion
the
sword
can
not
effect
everything
for
you
it
would
be
a
great
blessing
if
it
could
bring
some
men
to
their
senses
and
persuade
them
or
even
compel
them
to
love
any
one
with
genuine
affection
but
instead
it
will
destroy
the
body
of
one
man
and
alienate
the
minds
of
the
rest
people
do
not
become
more
attached
to
any
one
because
of
the
vengeance
they
see
meted
out
to
others
but
they
become
more
hostile
through
the
influence
of
their
own
fears
that
is
one
side
of
the
picture
on
the
other
hand
those
who
obtain
pardon
for
any
crime
and
repent
are
ashamed
to
wrong
their
benefactors
again
but
render
them
much
service
in
return
hoping
to
receive
much
more
again
for
it
when
a
man
is
saved
by
some
one
who
has
been
wronged
he
thinks
that
his
rescuer
if
fairly
treated
will
go
to
any
lengths
to
aid
him
heed
me
therefore
dearest
and
make
a
change
then
all
your
other
acts
that
have
caused
displeasure
will
appear
to
have
been
due
to
necessity
in
conducting
so
great
a
city
from
democracy
into
monarchy
it
is
impossible
to
make
the
transfer
without
bloodshed
but
if
you
follow
your
old
policy
you
will
be
thought
to
have
done
these
unpleasant
things
intentionally
augustus
heeded
these
suggestions
of
livia
and
released
all
those
against
whom
charges
were
pending
admonishing
some
of
them
orally
cornelius
he
even
appointed
consul
later
he
so
conciliated
both
him
and
the
other
men
that
no
one
else
again
really
plotted
against
him
or
had
the
reputation
of
so
doing
livia
had
had
most
to
do
with
saving
the
life
of
cornelius
yet
she
was
destined
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
death
of
augustus
u
at
this
time
in
the
consulship
of
cornelius
and
valerius
messala
earthquakes
of
ill
omen
occurred
and
the
tiber
tore
away
the
bridge
so
that
the
city
was
under
water
for
seven
days
there
was
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
and
famine
set
in
this
same
year
agrippa
was
enrolled
among
the
iuvenes
but
obtained
none
of
the
same
privileges
as
his
brother
the
senators
attended
the
separately
and
the
knights
also
separately
from
the
remainder
of
the
populace
as
is
done
nowadays
and
since
the
noblest
families
did
not
show
themselves
inclined
to
give
their
daughters
for
the
service
of
vesta
a
law
was
passed
that
the
daughters
of
freedmen
might
likewise
be
consecrated
many
contended
for
the
honor
and
so
they
drew
lots
in
the
senate
in
the
presence
of
their
fathers
no
priestess
however
was
appointed
from
this
class
the
soldiers
were
displeased
at
the
small
size
of
the
prizes
for
the
wars
that
had
taken
place
at
this
period
and
no
one
was
willing
to
carry
arms
for
longer
than
the
specified
term
of
his
service
it
was
therefore
voted
that
five
thousand
denarii
be
given
to
members
of
the
pretorian
guard
when
they
had
ended
sixteen
and
three
thousand
to
the
other
soldiers
when
they
had
completed
twenty
years
service
legions
were
being
supported
at
that
time

with
those
that
have
the
title
of
the
twenty
second
and
winter
in
upper
germany
augustus
took
in
charge
and
kept
and
this
i
say
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
are
by
no
means
called
valerians
by
all
and
do
not
themselves
use
the
title
any
longer
these
are
preserved
from
the
augustan
legions
of
the
rest
some
have
been
scattered
altogether
and
others
were
mixed
in
with
different
legions
by
augustus
himself
and
by
the
other
emperors
from
which
circumstance
they
are
thought
to
have
been
called
gemina
now
that
i
have
once
been
brought
into
a
discussion
of
the
legions
i
shall
speak
of
the
forces
as
they
are
at
present
according
to
the
disposition
made
by
subsequent
emperors
in
this
way
any
one
who
desires
to
learn
anything
about
them
may
do
so
easily
finding
all
his
information
written
in
one
place
nero
organized
the
first
legion
called
the
italian
and
now
wintering
in
lower
moesia
galba
the
first
legion
called
adiutrix
in
lower
pannonia
and
the
seventh
gemina
which
is
in
spain
vespasian
the
second
adiutrix
in
lower
pannonia
and
the
fourth
the
flavian
in
syria
domitian
the
first
minervia
in
lower
germany
trajan
the
second
the
egyptian
and
the
thirtieth
germanic
which
he
also
named
after
himself
marcus
antoninus
organized
the
second
which
is
in
noricum
and
the
third
in
rhætia
these
are
also
called
italian
severus
the
parthian
legions
the
first
and
the
third
in
mesopotamia
and
between
them
the
second
the
one
in
italy
this
is
at
present
the
number
of
legions
which
are
enrolled
in
the
service
exclusive
of
the
cohortes
urbanæ
and
the
pretorian
guard
at
that
time
in
the
days
of
augustus
those
i
mentioned
were
being
supported
whether
or
altogether
and
then
there
was
some
allied
force
whatever
the
size
of
infantry
and
cavalry
and
sailors
i
can
not
state
the
exact
figures
the
ten
thousand
in
all
were
divided
into
ten
portions
and
the
six
thousand
warders
of
the
city
into
four
portions
and
there
were
picked
foreign
horsemen
to
whom
the
name
batavians
is
applied
from
the
island
batavia
in
the
rhine
because
the
batavians
are
noted
for
superiority
in
horsemanship
i
can
not
however
state
their
exact
number
any
more
than
that
of
the
evocati
he
began
to
reckon
in
the
latter
from
the
time
that
he
called
the
warriors
who
had
previously
supported
his
father
to
arms
again
against
antony
and
he
retained
control
of
them
they
constitute
even
now
a
special
corps
and
carry
rods
like
the
centurions
for
the
distribution
mentioned
he
needed
money
and
therefore
introduced
a
motion
into
the
senate
to
the
effect
that
a
definite
permanent
fund
be
created
in
order
that
without
troubling
any
private
citizen
they
might
obtain
abundant
support
and
rewards
from
the
proposed
appropriation
the
means
for
such
a
fund
was
accordingly
as
no
one
showed
a
willingness
to
become
ædile
some
from
the
ranks
of
and
were
compelled
by
lot
to
take
the
office
this
happened
frequently
at
other
times
after
this
in
the
consulship
of
æmilius
lepidus
and
lucius
arruntius
when
no
source
for
the
fund
was
found
that
suited
anybody
but
quite
everybody
felt
dejected
because
such
an
attempt
was
being
made
augustus
in
the
name
of
himself
and
of
tiberius
put
money
into
the
treasury
which
he
called
the
ærarium
militare
some
of
the
such
as
drew
the
lots
he
instructed
to
administer
it
for
three
years
employing
two
lictors
apiece
and
such
further
assistance
as
was
fitting
this
was
done
by
successive
officials
for
a
number
of
years
at
present
they
are
chosen
by
whoever
is
emperor
and
they
go
about
without
lictors
augustus
himself
made
some
further
contributions
and
promised
to
do
this
annually
and
he
accepted
offers
from
kings
and
certain
peoples
from
private
individuals
though
a
number
were
ready
and
glad
to
give
as
they
said
he
would
take
nothing
but
as
all
this
proved
very
slight
in
comparison
with
the
large
amount
spent
and
there
was
need
of
some
inexhaustible
supply
he
ordered
each
one
of
the
senators
to
devise
means
by
himself
to
write
his
plan
in
a
book
and
give
it
to
him
to
look
over
this
was
not
because
he
had
no
plan
of
his
own
but
because
he
was
most
anxious
to
persuade
them
to
choose
the
one
that
he
wished
various
men
proposed
various
courses
but
he
would
approve
none
of
them
instead
he
arranged
for
five
per
cent
of
the
inheritances
and
bequests
which
should
be
left
by
deceased
persons
except
in
the
case
of
very
near
relations
or
poor
families
he
pretended
that
he
had
found
this
tax
suggestion
in
cæsar
memoirs
it
was
a
method
that
had
been
introduced
once
before
but
had
been
later
abolished
and
was
now
introduced
anew
in
this
way
he
increased
the
revenues
the
expenditures
made
by
three
men
of
consular
rank
whom
the
lot
designated
he
partly
made
smaller
and
partly
did
away
with
altogether
this
was
not
the
only
source
of
trouble
to
the
romans
there
was
also
a
severe
famine
as
a
consequence
the
gladiators
and
the
slaves
offered
for
sale
were
removed
to
a
distance
of
over
seven
hundred
and
fifty
stadia
augustus
and
others
dismissed
the
greater
part
of
their
retinue
there
was
a
cessation
of
lawsuits
and
senators
were
permitted
to
leave
the
city
and
go
where
they
pleased
in
order
to
prevent
any
hindrance
to
decrees
from
this
last
measure
it
was
ordered
that
all
those
framed
by
as
many
as
happened
to
attend
meetings
should
be
binding
moreover
were
appointed
to
take
charge
of
grain
and
bread
supplies
so
as
to
have
a
stated
quantity
sold
to
each
person
those
who
were
recipients
of
public
bounty
had
as
much
added
to
their
supply
gratis
by
augustus
as
they
might
obtain
at
any
time
when
even
that
did
not
suffice
he
forbade
the
citizens
to
hold
any
public
festivals
on
his
birthday
since
also
at
this
time
many
parts
of
the
city
fell
a
prey
to
fire
he
formed
a
company
of
freedmen
in
seven
divisions
to
render
assistance
on
such
occasions
and
appointed
a
knight
as
their
leader
thinking
soon
to
disband
them
he
did
not
do
this
however
having
ascertained
by
experience
that
the
aid
they
gave
was
most
valuable
and
necessary
he
kept
them
the
exist
to
the
present
day
subject
to
special
regulations
and
those
in
the
service
are
selected
not
from
the
freedmen
only
any
longer
but
from
on
the
rest
of
the
classes
as
well
they
have
barracks
in
the
city
and
draw
pay
from
the
public
treasury
the
multitude
under
the
burden
of
the
famine
and
the
tax
and
the
losses
sustained
by
fire
were
ill
at
ease
they
discussed
openly
many
schemes
of
insurrection
and
by
night
scattered
pamphlets
more
still
this
move
was
said
to
be
traceable
to
a
certain
publius
rufus
but
others
were
suspected
of
it
rufus
could
not
have
originated
or
have
taken
an
active
part
in
it
therefore
it
was
thought
that
others
who
aimed
at
a
revolution
were
making
an
illicit
use
of
his
name
an
investigation
of
the
affair
was
resolved
upon
and
rewards
for
information
offered
information
accordingly
came
in
and
the
city
as
a
result
was
stirred
up
this
lasted
till
the
scarcity
of
grain
subsided
when
gladiatorial
games
in
honor
of
drusus
were
given
by
germanicus
cæsar
and
tiberius
claudius
nero
his
sons
in
the
course
of
them
an
elephant
vanquished
a
rhinoceros
and
a
knight
distinguished
for
his
wealth
fought
as
a
gladiator
the
people
were
encouraged
by
this
honor
shown
to
the
memory
of
drusus
and
by
tiberius
dedication
of
the
temple
of
the
dioscuri
upon
which
he
inscribed
not
only
his
name
but
also
that
of
drusus
himself
he
called
claudianus
instead
of
claudius
because
of
his
adoption
into
the
family
of
augustus
he
continued
to
direct
operations
against
the
enemy
and
visited
the
city
constantly
whenever
opportunity
offered
this
was
partly
on
account
of
various
kinds
of
business
but
chiefly
owing
to
fear
that
augustus
might
promote
somebody
else
during
his
absence
these
were
the
events
in
the
city
that
year
in
achæa
the
governor
died
in
the
middle
of
his
term
and
directions
were
given
to
his
quæstor
and
to
his
assessor
whom
as
i
have
said
we
call
legatus
that
the
latter
should
administer
the
government
as
far
as
the
isthmus
and
the
former
the
rest
of
it
herod
of
palestine
who
was
accused
by
his
brothers
of
some
wrongdoing
was
banished
beyond
the
alps
and
his
portion
of
the
palestinian
domain
reverted
to
the
state
augustus
suffered
from
old
age
and
infirmity
so
that
he
could
not
transact
business
for
all
that
needed
his
aid
some
cases
he
reviewed
and
tried
with
his
counselors
sitting
upon
the
tribunal
on
the
palatine
the
embassies
which
came
from
the
various
nations
and
princes
he
put
in
charge
of
three
under
the
arrangement
that
any
one
of
them
individually
might
listen
to
such
an
embassy
and
return
an
answer
except
in
cases
where
it
was
necessary
for
himself
and
the
senate
to
render
a
decision
besides
during
this
same
period
also
many
wars
took
place
pirates
overran
many
quarters
so
that
sardinia
had
no
senatorial
governor
for
some
years
but
was
in
charge
of
soldiers
with
knights
for
commanders
not
a
few
cities
rebelled
with
the
result
that
for
two
years
the
same
persons
held
office
in
the
same
provinces
of
the
people
and
were
personally
appointed
instead
of
being
chosen
by
lot
the
provinces
of
cæsar
were
in
general
so
arranged
that
men
should
govern
in
the
same
places
for
a
considerable
time
however
i
shall
not
go
into
all
these
matters
minutely
many
things
not
worthy
of
record
happened
in
individual
instances
and
no
one
would
be
benefited
by
the
exact
details
i
shall
mention
simply
the
events
worth
remembering
and
very
briefly
save
those
of
greatest
importance
the
isaurians
began
marauding
expeditions
and
kept
on
till
they
faced
grim
war
but
were
finally
subdued
the
gætuli
discontented
with
their
king
juba
and
at
the
same
time
feeling
themselves
slighted
because
not
governed
by
the
romans
rose
against
him
they
ravaged
the
neighboring
territory
and
killed
even
many
of
the
romans
who
made
a
campaign
against
them
in
fine
they
gained
so
great
an
ascendancy
that
cornelius
cossus
who
reduced
them
received
triumphal
honors
and
title
for
it
while
these
troubles
were
in
progress
expeditions
against
the
celtæ
were
being
conducted
by
various
leaders
and
notably
by
tiberius
he
advanced
first
to
the
river
visurgis
and
subsequently
as
far
as
the
albis
but
nothing
of
any
moment
was
accomplished
then
although
not
only
augustus
but
also
tiberius
was
dubbed
imperator
for
it
and
gaius
sentius
governor
of
germany
received
triumphal
honors
the
celtæ
were
so
afraid
of
their
foes
that
they
made
a
truce
with
him
not
merely
once
but
twice
and
the
reason
that
peace
was
again
granted
them
in
spite
of
their
having
broken
it
so
soon
was
that
the
affairs
of
the
dalmatians
and
pannonians
who
had
begun
a
rebellion
on
a
large
scale
needed
vigilant
attention
the
dalmatians
smarting
under
the
levies
of
tribute
had
for
some
time
previous
kept
quiet
even
against
their
will
but
at
the
same
time
that
tiberius
made
his
second
campaign
against
the
celtæ
valerius
messalinus
the
governor
of
dalmatia
and
pannonia
was
himself
despatched
to
the
front
with
tiberius
taking
most
of
his
army
they
too
were
ordered
to
send
a
contingent
and
on
coming
together
for
this
purpose
had
a
chance
to
see
the
flower
of
their
fighting
force
after
that
there
was
no
more
delay
but
urged
on
particularly
by
one
bato
a
dæsidiatian
at
first
a
few
revolted
and
worsted
the
romans
that
came
against
them
and
this
success
then
led
others
to
rebel
next
the
breuci
a
pannonian
tribe
put
another
leader
named
bato
at
their
head
and
marched
against
sirmium
and
the
romans
in
the
town
this
they
did
not
capture
cæcina
severus
the
governor
of
moesia
close
by
he
heard
of
their
uprising
marched
rapidly
upon
them
and
joining
battle
with
them
near
the
river
dravus
vanquished
their
army
hoping
to
renew
the
struggle
soon
since
many
of
the
romans
also
had
fallen
they
turned
to
summon
their
allies
and
collected
as
many
as
they
could
meanwhile
the
dalmatian
bato
had
made
a
descent
upon
salonæ
and
being
himself
grievously
wounded
with
a
stone
accomplished
nothing
but
sent
some
others
who
wrought
havoc
along
the
whole
as
far
as
apollonia
there
in
spite
of
his
defeat
his
representatives
won
a
slight
battle
against
the
romans
who
encountered
them
tiberius
ascertaining
this
feared
they
might
invade
italy
and
so
returned
from
celtica
he
sent
messalinus
ahead
and
himself
followed
with
the
rest
of
the
army
bato
learned
of
their
approach
and
though
not
yet
well
went
to
meet
messalinus
he
proved
the
latter
superior
in
open
conflict
but
was
afterward
conquered
by
an
ambuscade
thereupon
he
went
to
bato
the
breucan
and
making
common
cause
with
him
in
the
war
occupied
a
mountain
named
alma
here
they
were
defeated
in
a
slight
skirmish
by
rhoemetalces
the
thracian
despatched
in
advance
against
them
by
severus
but
resisted
severus
himself
vigorously
later
severus
withdrew
to
moesia
because
the
dacians
and
the
sauromatæ
were
ravaging
it
and
while
tiberius
and
messalinus
were
tarrying
in
siscia
the
dalmatians
overran
their
allied
territory
and
likewise
caused
many
to
revolt
although
tiberius
approached
them
they
would
engage
in
no
open
battle
with
him
but
kept
moving
from
one
place
to
another
devastating
a
great
deal
of
ground
owing
to
their
knowledge
of
the
country
and
the
lightness
of
their
equipment
they
could
easily
go
wherever
they
pleased
when
winter
set
in
they
did
much
greater
damage
by
invading
macedonia
again
rhoemetalces
and
his
brother
rhascuporis
got
the
better
of
this
force
in
battle
the
rest
did
not
stay
in
their
territory
while
it
was
being
ravaged
this
was
principally
later
in
the
consulship
of
cæcilius
metellus
and
lincinius
silanus
but
took
refuge
on
the
heights
from
which
they
made
descents
whenever
they
saw
a
chance
when
augustus
learned
this
he
began
to
be
suspicious
of
tiberius
for
he
thought
the
latter
might
have
overcome
them
soon
but
was
delaying
purposely
so
that
he
might
be
under
arms
as
long
as
possible
with
war
for
an
excuse
the
emperor
therefore
sent
germanicus
though
he
was
then
quæstor
and
gave
him
soldiers
not
only
from
the
free
born
citizens
but
from
the
freedmen
some
of
whom
were
slaves
that
he
had
taken
from
both
men
and
women
in
return
for
their
value
with
food
for
six
months
and
had
set
free
this
was
not
the
only
measure
he
took
in
view
of
the
necessities
of
the
war
he
also
postponed
the
review
of
the
knights
which
was
wont
to
occur
in
the
forum
and
he
vowed
to
conduct
the
great
games
because
a
woman
had
cut
some
letters
on
her
arm
and
had
practiced
some
kind
of
divination
he
knew
well
to
be
sure
that
she
had
not
been
possessed
by
some
divine
power
but
had
done
it
intentionally
inasmuch
however
as
the
populace
were
terribly
wrought
up
over
the
wars
and
the
famine
which
had
now
set
in
once
more
he
too
affected
to
believe
what
was
said
and
did
anything
that
would
lead
to
the
encouragement
of
the
multitude
as
a
matter
of
course
in
view
of
the
stringency
in
the
grain
supply
he
again
appointed
two
grain
commissioners
from
among
the
together
with
lictors
as
there
was
need
of
further
money
for
operations
against
the
enemy
and
the
support
of
he
introduced
the
tax
of
two
per
cent
on
the
sale
of
slaves
and
he
ordered
that
the
money
delivered

the
public

to

armed
combats
should
no
longer
be
expended
the
reason
that
he
sent
germanicus
and
not
agrippa
to
take
the
field
was
that
the
latter
possessed
a
servile
nature
and
spent
most
of
his
time
fishing
wherefore
he
also
used
to
call
himself
neptune
he
used
to
give
way
to
violent
anger
and
slandered
julia
as
a
stepmother
while
upon
augustus
he
heaped
abundant
reproaches
in
the
matter
of
his
paternal
inheritance
when
he
could
not
be
made
to
moderate
his
conduct
he
was
banished
and
his
property
was
given
to
the
ærarium
militare
he
himself
was
put
ashore
on
planasia
the
island
near
these
were
the
events
in
the
city
germanicus
reached
pannonia
where
armies
from
various
points
were
shortly
to
assemble
the
batos
watched
for
severus
who
was
approaching
from
moesia
and
fell
upon
him
unexpectedly
while
he
was
encamped
near
the
volcæan
marshes
the
pickets
outside
the
ramparts
they
frightened
and
hurled
back
within
it
but
as
the
men
inside
stood
their
ground
the
attacking
party
was
defeated
after
this
the
romans
divided
in
order
that
many
detachments
might
overrun
the
country
in
separate
places
at
one
time
most
of
them
did
nothing
worthy
of
note
during
this
enterprise
but
germanicus
conquered
in
battle
and
badly
demoralized
the
mæzei
a
dalmatian
these
were
the
results
of
that
year
in
the
consulship
of
marcus
furius
with
sextus
nonius
the
dalmatians
and
pannonians
decided
they
would
like
to
make
peace
because
they
were
in
distress
primarily
from
famine
and
then
from
disease
that
followed
it
due
to
their
using
grasses
of
various
sorts
and
roots
for
food
they
did
not
attempt
however
to
open
any
negotiations
being
restrained
by
those
who
had
no
hope
of
preservation
at
the
hands
of
the
romans
so
even
as
they
were
they
still
resisted
and
one
scenobardus
who
had
feigned
a
readiness
to
change
sides
and
had
had
dealings
on
this
very
business
with
manius
ennius
commander
of
the
garrison
in
siscia
declaring
that
he
was
ready
to
desert
became
afraid
that
he
might
be
injured
ere
his
project
was
complete
and
po
which
they
call
the
monarch
of
rivers
that
cleave
the
soil
of
italy
known
by
the
name
eridanus
had
its
waters
let
into
a
very
broad
excavation
on
the
command
of
the
emperor
augustus
a
seventh
division
of
the
channel
of
this
river
flows
through
the
center
of
the
state
affording
at
its
mouth
a
most
satisfactory
harbor
and
was
formerly
believed
my
authority
is
dio
to
be
an
entirely
safe
anchorage
for
a
fleet
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
from
the
latin
of
jordan
when
the
famine
at
last
had
subsided
he
conducted
a
in
the
name
of
germanicus
who
was
son
of
drusus
and
in
the
name
of
his
brother
on
this
occasion
an
elephant
fought
a
rhinoceros
and
a
knight
who
had
once
held
a
prominent
position
on
account
of
wealth
contended
in
single
combat
and
he
found
himself
sinking
under
the
burden
of
old
age
and
physical
weakness
so
that
he
could
not
transact
business
with
all
the
persons
that
needed
his
services
he
delivered
to
three
the
care
of
the
embassies
that
were
constantly
arriving
from
peoples
and
kings
each
one
of
these
officials
separately
was
empowered
to
give
any
such
delegation
a
hearing
and
to
transmit
an
answer
to
them
save
in
such
cases
as
he
and
the
senate
needed
to
pass
upon
finally
other
questions
continued
to
be
investigated
and
decided
by
the
emperor
himself
with
the
help
of
his
cabinet
however
among
the
first
but
among
the
last
he
declared
in
order
that
everybody
might
be
permitted
to
hold
an
individual
opinion
and
no
one
of
them
be
obliged
to
abandon
his
own
ideas
because
he
felt
it
obligatory
to
agree
with
his
sovereign
and
he
would
often
help
the
magistrates
try
cases
also
as
often
as
the
consulting
judges
held
different
views
his
vote
was
reckoned
only
as
equal
to
that
of
any
one
else
it
was
at
this
time
that
augustus
allowed
the
senate
to
try
the
majority
of
cases
without
his
being
present
and
he
no
longer
frequented
the
assemblies
of
the
people
instead
he
had
the
previous
year
personally
appointed
all
who
were
to
hold
office
because
there
were
factional
outbreaks
this
year
and
those
following
he
merely
posted
a
kind
of
bulletin
and
made
known
to
the
plebs
and
to
the
people
what
persons
he
favored
yet
he
had
so
much
strength
for
managing
hostile
campaigns
that
he
journeyed
to
ariminum
in
order
that
he
might
be
able
to
give
from
close
at
hand
all
necessary
advice
in
regard
to
the
dalmatians
and
pannonians
prayers
were
offered
at
his
departure
and
sacrifices
upon
his
return
as
if
he
had
come
back
from
some
hostile
territory
this
was
what
was
done
in
rome
meantime
bato
the
breucan
who
had
betrayed
pinnes
and
received
the
governorship
of
the
breuci
as
reward
for
this
was
captured
by
the
other
bato
and
perished
the
breucan
had
been
a
little
suspicious
of
his
subject
tribes
and
went
around
to
each
of
the
garrisons
to
demand
hostages
the
other
learning
of
this
habit
lay
in
wait
for
him
conquered
him
in
battle
and
shut
him
up
within
the
fortifications
later
his
defeated
rival
was
given
up
by
those
in
the
place
and
he
took
him
and
led
him
before
the
army
whereupon
the
man
was
condemned
to
death
and
sentence
executed
without
delay
after
this
event
numbers
of
the
pannonians
rose
in
revolt
silvanus
led
a
campaign
in
person
conquered
the
breucans
and
won
the
allegiance
of
some
of
the
rest
without
a
struggle
bato
seeing
this
gave
up
all
hope
of
pannonia
but
stationed
garrisons
at
the
passes
leading
to
dalmatia
and
ravaged
the
country
then
the
remainder
of
the
pannonians
especially
as
their
country
was
suffering
harm
from
silvanus
made

give

and

on

with

sought
for

and

the

were

than
the

he
was
filled

grief
and
addressed
them
to
the
following
effect
though
you
are
but
few
all
together
in
comparison
with
the
great
throng
that
inhabits
this
city
and
are
far
behind
the
others
who
are
unwilling
to
fulfill
their
duties
at
all
yet
for
this
reason
i
praise
you
the
more
and
i
am
heartily
grateful
that
you
have
shown
yourselves
obedient
and
are
helping
to
replenish
the
fatherland
it
is
by
lives
so
conducted
that
the
romans
of
later
days
will
become
a
mighty
multitude
we
were
at
first
a
mere
handful
but
when
we
had
recourse
to
marriage
and
begot
children
we
came
to
surpass
all
mankind
not
only
in
manliness
but
in
populousness
this
we
must
remember
and
console
the
mortal
element
of
our
being
with
an
endless
succession
of
generations
like
torches
thus
the
one
gap
which
separates
us
from
divine
happiness
may
through
relays
of
men
be
filled
by
immortality
it
was
for
this
cause
most
of
all
that
that
first
and
greatest
god
who
fashioned
us
divided
the
race
of
mortals
in
twain
rendering
one
half
of
it
male
and
the
other
female
and
added
love
and
the
compulsion
of
their
intercourse
together
making
their
association
fruitful
that
by
the
young
continually
born
he
might
in
a
way
render
mortality
eternal
even
of
the
gods
themselves
some
are
believed
to
be
male
the
rest
female
and
the
tradition
prevails
that
some
have
begotten
others
and
certain
ones
have
been
born
of
others
so
even
among
them
who
need
no
such
device
marriage
and
have
been
approved
as
noble
you
have
done
right
then
to
imitate
the
gods
and
right
to
emulate
your
fathers
that
just
as
they
begot
you
you
may
also
bring
others
into
the
world
just
as
you
deem
them
and
name
them
ancestors
others
will
regard
you
and
address
you
in
similar
fashion
the
undertakings
which
they
nobly
achieved
and
handed
down
to
you
with
glory
you
will
hand
on
to
others
the
possessions
which
they
acquired
and
left
to
you
will
leave
to
others
sprung
from
your
own
loins
surely
the
best
of
all
things
is
a
woman
who
is
temperate
domestic
a
good
a
rearer
of
children
one
to
gladden
you
when
in
health
to
tend
you
when
sick
to
be
your
partner
in
good
fortune
to
console
you
in
misfortune
to
restrain
the
frenzied
nature
of
the
youth
and
to
temper
the
superannuated
severity
of
the
old
man
is
it
not
a
delight
to
acknowledge
a
child
bearing
the
nature
of
both
to
nurture
and
educate
it
a
physical
image
and
a
spiritual
image
so
that
in
its
growth
you
yourself
live
again
is
it
not
most
blessed
on
departing
from
life
to
leave
behind
a
successor
to
and
inheritor
of
one
substance
and
family
something
that
is
one
own
sprung
from
one
self
and
to
have
only
one
human
part
waste
away
but
to
live
through
the
child
as
successor
we
need
not
be
in
the
hands
of
aliens
as
in
war
nor
perish
utterly
as
in
war
these
are
the
private
advantages
that
accrue
to
those
who
marry
and
beget
children
but
for
the
state
for
whose
sake
we
ought
to
do
many
things
that
are
even
distasteful
to
us
how
excellent
and
how
necessary
it
is
if
cities
and
peoples
are
to
exist
if
you
are
to
rule
others
and
others
are
to
obey
you
that
there
should
be
a
multitude
of
men
to
till
the
earth
in
peace
and
quiet
to
make
voyages
practice
arts
follow
handicrafts
men
who
in
war
will
protect
what
we
already
have
with
the
greater
zeal
because
of
family
ties
and
will
replace
those
that
fall
by
others
therefore
men
for
you
alone
may
properly
be
called
men
and
fathers
for
you
are
worthy
to
hold
this
title
like
myself
i
love
you
and
i
praise
you
for
this
i
am
glad
of
the
prizes
i
have
already
offered
and
i
will
glorify
you
still
more
besides
by
honors
and
offices
thus
you
may
yourselves
reap
great
benefits
and
leave
them
to
your
children
undiminished
i
shall
now
descend
to
speak
to
the
rest
who
have
not
done
like
you
and
whose
lot
will
therefore
be
directly
the
opposite
you
will
thus
learn
not
only
from
words
but
by
facts
even
more
how
far
you
excel
them
after
this
speech
he
made
presents
to
some
of
them
at
once
and
promised
to
make
others
he
then
went
over
to
the
other
throng
to
whom
he
addressed
these
words
a
strange
experience
has
been
mine
o
what
shall
i
call
you
men
but
you
do
not
perform
the
offices
of
citizens
but
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
the
city
is
romans
but
you
are
undertaking
to
do
away
with
this
well
at
any
rate
whoever
you
are
and
by
whatever
name
you
delight
to
be
called
mine
has
been
an
unexpected
experience
for
though
i
am
always
doing
everything
to
promote
an
increase
of
population
among
you
and
am
now
about
to
rebuke
you
i
grieve
to
see
that
you
are
numerous
i
could
rather
wish
that
those
others
to
whom
i
have
just
spoken
were
so
many
than
to
see
you
as
many
as
you
are
or
still
better
to
see
you
mustered
with
them
or
at
least
not
to
know
how
things
stand
it
is
you
who
without
pausing
to
reflect
on
the
foresight
of
the
gods
or
the
care
of
your
forefathers
are
bent
upon
annihilating
your
whole
race
and
making
it
in
truth
mortal
upon
destroying
and
ending
the
whole
roman
nation
what
seed
of
human
beings
would
be
left
if
all
the
remainder
of
mankind
should
do
the
same
as
you
you
are
their
leaders
and
may
rightly
bear
the
responsibility
for
universal
destruction
or
even
if
no
others
emulate
you
will
you
not
be
justly
hated
for
the
very
reason
that
you
overlook
what
no
one
else
would
overlook
and
neglect
what
no
one
else
would
neglect
you
are
introducing
customs
and
practices
which
if
imitated
would
lead
to
the
annihilation
of
all
and
if
hated
would
end
in
your
own
punishment
we
do
not
spare
murderers
because
all
persons
do
not
murder
nor
do
we
let
go
because
not
everybody
robs
temples
but
anybody
who
is
convicted
of
committing
any
forbidden
act
is
chastised
for
the
very
reason
that
he
alone
or
as
one
of
a
small
group
does
such
things
as
no
one
else
would
do
yet
if
one
should
name
over
the
greatest
offences
there
is
none
to
compare
with
that
which
is
now
being
committed
by
you
and
this
statement
holds
true
not
only
if
you
examine
crime
for
crime
but
if
you
compare
all
of
them
together
with
this
single
one
of
yours
you
have
incurred
blood
guiltiness
by
not
begetting
those
who
ought
to
be
your
descendants
you
are
sacrilegious
in
putting
an
end
to
the
names
and
honors
of
your
ancestors
you
are
impious
in
abolishing
your
families
which
were
instituted
by
the
gods
and
destroying
the
greatest
of
offerings
to
them
the
human
being
and
by
overthrowing
in
this
way
their
rites
and
their
temples
moreover
by
causing
the
downfall
of
the
government
you
are
disobedient
to
the
laws
and
you
even
betray
your
country
by
rendering
her
barren
and
childless
nay
more
you
lay
her
even
with
the
dust
by
making
her
destitute
of
inhabitants
a
city
consists
of
human
beings
not
of
houses
or
porticos
or
fora
empty
of
men
think
what
rage
would
justly
seize
the
great
romulus
the
founder
of
our
race
if
he
could
reflect
on
the
circumstances
of
his
own
birth
and
then
upon
your
attitude
refusing
to
get
children
even
by
lawful
marriages
how
wrathful
would
the
romans
who
were
his
followers
be
when
they
considered
that
they
themselves
even
seized
foreign
girls
but
you
are
not
satisfied
with
those
of
your
own
race
they
actually
had
children
even
by
their
enemies
you
will
not
beget
them
even
of
women
with
undisputed
standing
in
the
state
how
incensed
would
curtius
be
who
endured
to
die
that
the
married
men
might
not
be
sundered
from
their
wives
how
indignant
hersilia
the
attendant
of
her
daughter
who
instituted
for
us
all
the
rites
of
marriage
our
fathers
fought
the
sabines
to
obtain
marriages
and
made
peace
through
the
intercession
of
their
wives
and
children
they
administered
oaths
and
made
sundry
treaties
for
this
very
purpose
you
are
bringing
all
that
labor
to
naught
why
is
it
do
you
desire
to
live
forever
apart
from
women
as
the
vestal
virgins
live
apart
from
men
then
you
should
be
punished
like
them
if
you
break
out
into
any
act
of
lewdness
i
know
that
my
words
to
you
appear
bitter
and
harsh
but
first
of
all
reflect
that
physicians
too
treat
many
patients
by
burning
when
they
can
not
recover
health
in
any
other
way
in
the
second
place
it
is
not
my
wish
or
my
pleasure
to
speak
them
and
hence
it
is
that
i
have
this
further
reproach
to
bring
against
you
that
you
have
provoked
me
to
this
discourse
if
you
dislike
what
i
say
do
not
continue
the
conduct
for
which
you
are
inevitably
reprimanded
if
my
speech
wounds
any
of
you
how
much
more
do
your
acts
wound
both
me
and
all
the
rest
of
the
romans
if
you
vexed
in
very
truth
make
a
change
that
so
i
may
praise
and
reward
you
you
yourselves
are
aware
that
i
am
not
irritable
by
nature
and
that
i
have
done
subject
to
human
limitations
all
the
acts
proper
for
a
good
lawgiver
never
in
old
times
was
any
one
permitted
to
neglect
marriage
and
the
rearing
of
children
but
from
the
very
outset
at
the
first
establishment
of
the
government
strict
laws
were
passed
regarding
them
since
then
many
decrees
have
been
issued
by
both
the
senate
and
the
people
which
it
would
be
superfluous
to
enumerate
i
have
increased
the
penalties
for
the
disobedient
in
order
that
through
fear
of
becoming
liable
to
them
you
may
be
brought
to
your
senses
to
those
that
obey
i
have
offered
more
numerous
and
greater
prizes
than
are
given
for
any
other
display
of
excellence
that
if
for
no
other
reason
at
least
by
this
one
you
may
be
persuaded
to
marry
and
beget
children
yet
you
not
striving
for
any
of
the
recompenses
nor
fearing
any
of
the
penalties
have
despised
all
these
measures
have
trodden
them
all
under
foot
as
if
you
were
not
even
inhabitants
of
the
city
you
declare
you
have
taken
upon
yourselves
this
free
and
continent
life
without
wives
and
without
children
you
are
no
different
from
robbers
or
the
most
savage
beasts
it
is
not
your
delight
in
a
solitary
existence
that
leads
you
to
live
without
wives
there
is
not
one
of
you
who
either
eats
alone
or
sleeps
alone
but
you
want
to
have
opportunity
for
wantonness
and
licentiousness
yet
i
have
allowed
you
to
court
girls
still
tender
and
not
yet
of
age
for
marriage
in
order
that
having
the
name
of
intendant
bridegrooms
you
may
lead
a
domestic
life
and
those
not
in
the
senatorial
class
i
have
permitted
to
wed
freedwomen
so
that
if
any
one
through
passion
or
some
inclination
should
be
disposed
to
such
a
proceeding
he
might
go
about
it
lawfully
i
have
not
limited
you
rigidly
to
this
even
but
at
first
gave
you
three
whole
years
in
which
to
make
preparations
and
later
two
yet
not
even
so
by
threatening
or
urging
or
postponing
or
entreating
have
i
accomplished
anything
you
see
for
yourselves
how
much
larger
a
mass
you
constitute
than
the
married
men
when
you
ought
by
this
time
to
have
furnished
us
with
as
many
more
children
or
rather
with
several
times
your
number
how
otherwise
shall
families
continue
how
can
the
commonwealth
be
preserved
if
we
neither
marry
nor
produce
children
surely
you
are
not
expecting
some
to
spring
up
from
the
earth
to
succeed
to
your
goods
and
to
public
affairs
as
myths
describe
it
is
neither
pleasing
to
heaven
nor
creditable
that
our
race
should
cease
and
the
name
of
romans
meet
extinguishment
in
us
and
the
city
be
given
up
to
foreigners
greek
or
even
barbarians
we
liberate
slaves
chiefly
for
the
purpose
of
making
out
of
them
as
many
citizens
as
possible
we
give
our
allies
a
share
in
the
government
that
our
numbers
may
increase
yet
you
romans
of
the
original
stock
including
quintii
valerii
iulli
are
eager
that
your
families
and
names
at
once
shall
perish
with
you
i
am
thoroughly
ashamed
that
i
have
been
led
to
speak
in
such
a
fashion
have
done
with
your
madness
then
and
reflect
now
if
not
before
that
with
many
dying
all
the
time
by
disease
and
many
in
the
wars
it
is
impossible
for
the
city
to
maintain
itself
unless
the
multitude
in
it
is
constantly
reinforced
by
those
who
are
ever
and
anon
being
born
let
no
one
of
you
think
that
i
am
ignorant
of
the
many
disagreeable
and
painful
features
that
belong
to
marriage
and
but
bear
in
mind
that
we
possess
nothing
at
all
good
with
which
some
bane
is
not
mingled
and
that
in
our
most
abundant
and
greatest
blessings
there
reside
the
most
abundant
and
greatest
woes
if
you
decline
to
accept
the
latter
do
not
strive
to
obtain
the
former
practically
all
who
possess
any
real
excellence
and
pleasure
are
obliged
to
work
before
its
enjoyment
to
work
at
the
time
and
to
work
afterward
why
should
i
lengthen
my
speech
by
going
into
each
one
of
them
in
detail
therefore
even
if
there
are
some
unpleasant
features
connected
with
marriage
and
the
begetting
of
children
set
over
against
them
the
better
elements
you
will
find
them
more
numerous
and
more
vital
for
in
addition
to
all
the
other
blessings
that
naturally
inhere
in
this
state
of
life
the
prizes
offered
by
law
an
infinitesimal
portion
of
which
determines
many
to
undergo
death
might
induce
anybody
to
obey
me
and
is
it
not
a
disgrace
that
for
rewards
which
influence
others
to
give
up
their
own
lives
you
should
be
unwilling
either
to
marry
wives
or
to
rear
children
therefore
for
i
believe
that
i
have
now
persuaded
you
both
to
hold
fast
to
the
name
of
citizens
and
to
secure
the
additional
title
of
men
and
fathers
i
have
administered
this
rebuke
reluctantly
but
of
necessity
not
as
your
foe
nor
as
one
hating
you
but
rather
loving
you
and
wishing
to
obtain
many
others
like
you
as
one
wishing
you
to
guard
lawful
hearths
with
houses
full
of
descendants
that
we
may
approach
the
gods
together
with
wives
and
children
and
associate
with
one
another
standing
on
an
equality
in
whatever
we
possess
and
harvesting
equally
the
hopes
to
which
it
gives
rise
how
could
i
call
myself
a
good
ruler
over
you
if
i
should
endure
seeing
you
becoming
constantly
fewer
how
could
i
any
longer
be
rightfully
named
your
father
if
you
rear
no
children
therefore
if
you
really
have
a
regard
for
me
and
have
given
me
this
title
not
out
of
flattery
but
as
an
honor
desire
yourselves
to
become
men
and
fathers
thus
you
may
yourselves
share
this
title
and
also
render
me
well
named
such
were
his
words
to
both
groups
at
that
time
after
this
he
increased
the
rewards
for
those
having
children
and
by
penalties
made
a
still
wider
difference
between
the
married
and
those
without
wives
he
further
allowed
each
of
them
a
year
in
which
persons
who
obeyed
him
might
render
themselves
by
yielding
obedience
contrary
to
the
voconian
law
according
to
which
no
woman
could
inherit
any
property
over
two
and
a
half
myriads
in
value
he
gave
women
permission
to
become
inheritors
of
any
amount
he
also
granted
the
vestal
virgins
all
the
benefits
enjoyed
by
women
who
had
children
later
the
pappian
and
poppæan
law
was
framed
by
marcus
pappius
mutilus
and
by
quintus
poppæus
secundus
who
were
then
consuls
for
a
portion
of
the
year
it
turned
out
that
both
of
them
had
not
only
no
children
but
not
even
wives
from
this
very
fact
the
need
of
the
law
was
these
were
the
events
in
rome
germanicus
meanwhile
had
captured
among
other
posts
in
dalmatia
also
splonum
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
occupied
a
naturally
strong
position
was
well
protected
by
walls
and
had
a
huge
number
of
defenders
consequently
he
was
unable
to
accomplish
aught
with
engines
or
by
assaults
yet
he
took
it
as
a
result
of
the
following
coincidence
pusio
a
celtic
horseman
discharged
a
stone
against
the
wall
which
so
shook
the
superstructure
that
it
immediately
fell
and
dragged
down
the
man
who
was
leaning
upon
it
at
this
the
rest
were
terrified
and
in
fear
left
the
wall
to
ascend
the
acropolis
subsequently
they
surrendered
both
it
and
themselves
the
romans
under
germanicus
having
reached
rætinium
a
city
of
dalmatia
fared
rather
badly
their
opponents
forced
back
by
the
numbers
could
not
resist
them
and
therefore
placed
fire
in
a
circle
about
themselves
and
threw
it
into
the
buildings
near
by
devising
a
way
to
keep
it
surely
from
blazing
up
at
once
and
to
make
it
go
unnoticed
for
a
long
time
the
enemy
after
doing
this
retired
to
the
heights
the
romans
unaware
of
their
action
followed
hard
after
them
expecting
to
find
no
work
at
all
in
pillaging
extensively
thus
they
got
inside
of
the
circle
of
fire
and
with
their
minds
directed
upon
the
enemy
saw
nothing
of
it
until
they
were
encompassed
by
it
on
all
sides
then
they
found
themselves
in
imminent
danger
being
pelted
by
men
from
above
and
injured
by
fire
from
without
they
could
neither
safely
stay
where
they
were
nor
break
their
way
out
without
danger
if
they
stood
out
of
range
of
the
missiles
they
were
consumed
by
the
fire
or
if
they
jumped
away
from
the
flame
they
were
destroyed
by
the
hurlers
of
missiles
some
were
caught
in
narrow
places
and
perished
by
both
at
once
wounded
on
one
side
and
burned
on
the
other
the
majority
of
those
who
entered
the
circle
met
their
fate
in
this
way
some
few
by
casting
corpses
into
the
very
flame
and
making
a
passage
over
them
as
over
bridges
managed
to
escape
the
fire
gained
such
headway
that
not
even
those
on
the
acropolis
could
stay
there
but
abandoned
it
in
the
night
and
hid
themselves
in
subterranean
chambers
these
were
the
operations
at
that
seretium
which
tiberius
had
once
besieged
but
not
captured
was
subdued
and
after
this
some
other
towns
were
more
easily
won
but
since
the
remainder
even
under
these
conditions
offered
resistance
and
the
war
kept
lengthening
out
and
famine
came
in
its
train
especially
in
italy
augustus
sent
tiberius
again
into
dalmatia
he
saw
that
the
soldiers
were
not
for
enduring
further
delay
and
were
anxious
to
end
the
war
in
some
way
eyen
if
it
involved
danger
therefore
fearing
that
if
they
remained
in
one
place
together
they
might
revolt
he
divided
them
into
three
parts
one
he
assigned
to
silvanus
and
one
to
marcus
lepidus
with
the
remainder
he
marched
with
germanicus
against
bato
without
difficulty
the
two
former
overcame
those
arrayed
in
battle
opposite
them
tiberius
himself
went
wandering
off
through
practically
the
entire
country
as
bato
appeared
first
at
one
point
and
then
at
another
finally
bato
took
refuge
in
fort
andetrium
located
close
to
salonæ
and
tiberius
who
besieged
him
found
himself
in
sore
straits
the
garrison
had
the
protection
of
fortifications
built
upon
a
well
guarded
rock
difficult
of
access
encircled
by
deep
ravines
through
which
torrents
roared
and
the
men
had
all
necessary
provisions
part
of
which
they
had
previously
stored
there
while
a
part
they
were
still
bringing
from
the
mountains
which
were
in
their
hands
moreover
by
ambuscades
they
interfered
with
the
roman
provision
trains
hence
tiberius
though
supposed
to
be
besieging
them
was
himself
placed
in
the
position
of
a
besieged
force
he
was
in
a
dilemma
and
could
not
find
any
plan
to
pursue
the
siege
was
proving
fruitless
and
dangerous
and
a
retreat
appeared
disgraceful
this
led
to
an
uproar
on
the
part
of
the
soldiers
who
raised
so
great
an
outcry
that
the
enemy
who
were
encamped
in
the
shelter
of
the
wall
were
terrified
and
retreated
as
a
consequence
being
partly
angry
and
partly
pleased
he
called
them
together
and
administered
some
rebukes
and
some
admonition
he
displayed
no
rashness
nor
yet
did
he
withdraw
but
remained
quietly
on
the
spot
until
bato
despairing
of
victory
sent
a
herald
to
ask
terms
this
act
was
due
to
the
subjugation
of
all
but
a
few
of
the
other
tribes
and
the
fact
that
the
force
which
bato
had
was
inferior
to
the
one
then
opposing
it
he
could
not
persuade
the
rest
to
ask
a
truce
and
so
abandoned
them
nor
did
he
again
assist
one
of
them
though
he
received
many
requests
for
aid
tiberius
consequently
conceived
a
contempt
for
those
still
left
in
the
fortress
and
thinking
that
he
could
conquer
them
without
loss
paid
no
further
heed
to
the
nature
of
the
country
but
proceeded
straight
up
the
cliff
since
there
was
no
level
ground
and
the
enemy
would
not
come
down
against
them
he
himself
took
his
seat
on
a
platform
in
full
view
in
order
to
watch
the
engagement
for
this
would
cause
his
soldiers
to
contend
more
vigorously
and
to
render
opportune
assistance
should
there
be
any
need
of
it
he
kept
a
part
of
the
army
inasmuch
as
he
had
a
great
plenty
of
men
for
this
very
purpose
the
rest
drawn
up
in
a
dense
square
at
first
proceeded
at
a
walk
later
they
were
separated
by
the
steepness
and
unevenness
of
the
mountain
which
was
full
of
gullies
and
at
many
points
cut
up
into
ravines
and
some
ascended
more
quickly
others
more
slowly
seeing
this
the
dalmatians
marshaled
outside
the
wall
at
the
top
of
the
steep
and
hurled
down
quantities
of
stones
upon
them
throwing
some
from
slings
and
rolling
down
others
others
set
in
motion
wheels
others
whole
wagons
full
of
rocks
others
circular
chests
manufactured
in
some
way
peculiar
to
the
country
and
packed
with
stones
all
these
things
coming
down
with
great
noise
kept
striking
in
different
quarters
as
if
discharged
from
a
sling
and
separated
the
romans
from
one
another
even
more
than
before
and
crushed
them
others
by
discharging
either
missiles
or
spears
knocked
many
of
them
down
at
this
juncture
much
rivalry
developed
on
the
part
of
the
warriors
one
side
endeavoring
to
ascend
and
conquer
the
heights
the
other
to
repulse
them
and
hurl
them
back
there
was
great
excitement
also
on
the
part
of
the
rest
who
watched
the
action
from
the
walls
and
on
the
part
of
those
about
tiberius
each
side
as
a
body
and
also
individually
encouraged
its
own
men
trying
to
lend
strength
to
such
as
showed
zeal
and
chiding
those
that
anywhere
gave
way
those
whose
voices
could
be
heard
above
the
rest
were
invoking
the
gods
both
parties
praying
for
the
protection
of
their
warriors
for
the
time
being
and
one
side
calling
for
freedom
for
themselves
in
the
future
and
the
other
for
peace
under
these
circumstances
the
romans
would
certainly
have
risked
their
lives
in
vain
having
to
contend
against
two
things
at
once
the
nature
of
the
country
and
the
lines
of
their
antagonists
had
not
tiberius
by
sudden
reinforcements
prevented
them
from
taking
to
flight
and
disturbed
the
enemy
from
another
quarter
by
means
of
other
soldiers
who
went
about
and
ascended
the
incline
a
considerable
distance
off
as
a
result
the
enemy
were
routed
and
could
not
even
enter
the
fortifications
but
scattered
up
the
mountain
sides
first
casting
off
their
armor
so
as
to
be
lightly
equipped
their
pursuers
followed
them
at
every
point
for
they
were
exceedingly
anxious
to
end
the
war
and
did
not
want
them
to
unite
again
and
cause
trouble
so
they
discovered
the
most
of
them
hiding
in
the
forests
and
killed
them
like
beasts
after
which
they
took
possession
of
the
men
in
the
fort
who
capitulated
to
these
tiberius
assured
the
rights
which
had
been
agreed
upon
and
some
others
germanicus
now
turned
to
meet
his
adversaries
for
many
deserters
who
were
in
their
ranks
prevented
a
peaceful
settlement
he
succeeded
in
enslaving
a
place
called
arduba
but
could
not
do
it
with
his
own
force
though
the
latter
was
far
greater
than
his
opponents
army
the
town
had
been
powerfully
strengthened
and
a
river
with
a
strong
current
surrounded
its
foundations
except
for
a
small
space
but
the
deserters
had
a
dispute
with
the
inhabitants
because
the
latter
were
anxious
for
peace
and
came
to
blows
with
them
the
assailants
had
the
coöperation
of
the
women
in
the
town
for
these
contrary
to
the
judgment
of
the
men
desired
liberty
and
were
ready
to
suffer
any
fate
whatever
sooner
than
slavery
there
was
consequently
a
great
battle
the
deserters
were
beaten
and
surrendered
and
some
of
them
made
their
escape
the
women
caught
up
their
children
and
some
threw
themselves
into
the
fire
others
hurled
themselves
down
into
the
river
in
this
way
that
post
was
taken
and
others
near
it
voluntarily
came
to
an
understanding
with
germanicus
he
after
effecting
this
went
back
to
tiberius
and
postumius
completed
the
subjugation
of
the
remaining
sections
upon
this
bato
sent
his
son
sceuas
to
tiberius
promising
to
surrender
himself
and
all
his
followers
if
he
could
obtain
protection
when
he
had
received
a
pledge
he
came
by
night
into
his
conqueror
camp
and
was
on
the
following
day
led
before
the
latter
who
was
seated
on
a
platform
bato
asked
nothing
for
himself
even
holding
his
head
forward
to
await
the
stroke
but
in
behalf
of
the
rest
he
made
a
long
defence
being
again
asked
by
tiberius
why
has
it
pleased
you
to
revolt
and
to
war
against
us
so
long
a
time
he
made
the
same
answer
as
before
you
are
responsible
for
this
for
you
send
as
guardians
over
your
flocks
not
dogs
or
shepherds
but
wolves
in
this
way
then
the
war
was
ended
once
more
after
many
men
and
much
money
had
been
consumed
the
legions
supported
for
it
were
very
numerous
whereas
the
spoils
taken
were
exceedingly
meagre
on
this
occasion
also
germanicus
announced
the
victory
in
honor
of
which
augustus
and
tiberius
were
allowed
to
bear
the
name
imperator
and
to
celebrate
a
triumph
and
they
received
still
other
honors
as
well
as
two
arches
bearing
trophies
in
pannonia
these
at
least
were
all
of
many
distinctions
voted
that
augustus
would
accept
germanicus
received
triumphal
honors
which
belonged
likewise
to
the
other
commanders
and
prætorial
honors
the
right
of
casting
his
vote
immediately
after
the
and
of
obtaining
the
consulship
earlier
than
custom
allowed
drusus
the
son
of
tiberius
although
he
had
not
participated
in
the
war
was
voted
permission
to
attend
the
sittings
of
the
senate
before
he
became
a
member
of
that
body
and
when
he
should
become
quæstor
to
cast
his
vote
before
the
exprætors
scarcely
had
these
resolutions
been
passed
when
terrible
news
that
arrived
from
germany
prevented
them
from
holding
any
festivals
at
that
same
period
the
following
events
had
taken
place
in
celtica
the
romans
had
a
hold
on
parts
of
it
not
the
whole
region
but
just
places
that
happened
to
have
been
subdued
so
that
the
fact
has
not
received
historical
notice
and
soldiers
of
theirs
were
used
to
wintering
there
and
cities
were
being
founded
the
barbarians
were
adapting
themselves
to
roman
ways
were
taking
up
the
custom
of
markets
and
were
holding
peaceful
meetings
they
had
not
however
forgotten
their
ancestral
habits
their
native
manners
the
life
of
independence
or
the
authority
given
by
arms
hence
while
they
were
unlearning
them
gradually
and
imperceptibly
with
careful
watching
they
were
not
disturbed
by
the
changed
conditions
of
existence
and
they
were
becoming
different
without
knowing
it
finally
quintilius
varus
received
the
command
of
germany
and
in
the
discharge
of
his
office
strove
in
administering
the
affairs
of
the
people
to
introduce
more
widespread
changes
among
them
he
treated
them
in
general
as
if
they
were
already
slaves
levying
money
upon
them
as
he
had
upon
subject
nations
this
they
were
not
inclined
to
endure
for
the
prominent
men
longed
for
their
former
ascendency
and
the
masses
preferred
their
accustomed
constitution
to
foreign
domination
they
did
not
openly
revolt
since
they
saw
there
were
many
roman
soldiers
near
the
rhine
and
many
in
their
own
territory
but
they
received
varus
pretending
they
would
execute
all
his
commands
and
took
him
far
away
from
the
rhine
into
cheruscis
near
the
visurgis
there
by
behaving
in
a
most
peaceful
and
friendly
manner
they
led
him
to
believe
that
they
could
be
trusted
to
live
submissively
without
soldiers
consequently
he
did
not
keep
his
legions
together
as
was
proper
in
an
enemy
country
and
many
of
the
men
he
distributed
to
helpless
communities
who
asked
it
for
the
supposed
purpose
of
guarding
certain
localities
or
arresting
robbers
or
escorting
provision
trains
those
deepest
in
the
conspiracy
and
the
leaders
of
the
plot
and
of
the
war
among
others
armenius
and
segimerus
were
his
constant
companions
and
often
entertained
him
he
accordingly
became
confident
and
expecting
no
harm
not
only
refused
to
believe
all
such
as
suspected
the
truth
and
advised
him
to
be
on
his
guard
but
even
rebuked
them
on
the
ground
that
they
were
needlessly
disturbed
and
slandered
his
friends
then
there
came
an
uprising
first
of
those
dwelling
at
a
distance
from
him
purposely
contrived
that
varus
should
march
against
them
and
be
easier
overcome
while
on
his
journey
through
what
he
deemed
a
friendly
country
and
that
he
might
not
at
once
know
that
all
were
his
enemies
and
guard
himself
against
all
of
them
it
turned
out
precisely
so
they
escorted
him
on
his
setting
out
and
begged
to
be
excused
from
attendance
in
order
to
gather
auxiliaries
as
they
said
after
which
they
would
quickly
come
to
his
assistance
so
then
they
took
charge
of
forces
already
in
waiting
and
after
killing
the
different
bodies
of
soldiers
for
whom
they
had
previously
asked
they
encountered
him
in
the
midst
of
forests
by
this
time
hard
to
traverse
there
they
showed
themselves
as
enemies
instead
of
subjects
and
wrought
many
deeds
of
fearful
injury
the
mountains
had
an
uneven
surface
broken
by
ravines
and
the
trees
standing
close
together
were
extremely
tall
hence
the
romans
even
before
the
enemy
assaulted
them
were
having
hard
work
in
felling
road
making
and
bridging
places
that
required
it
they
had
with
them
many
wagons
and
many
beasts
of
burden
as
in
a
time
of
peace
not
a
few
children
and
women
and
a
large
body
of
servants
were
following
them
another
reason
for
their
advancing
in
scattered
groups
meanwhile
a
great
rain
and
wind
came
up
that
separated
them
still
farther
while
the
ground
being
slippery
where
there
were
roots
and
logs
made
walking
very
difficult
for
them
and
the
top
branches
of
trees
which
kept
breaking
off
and
falling
down
caused
confusion
while
the
romans
were
in
such
perplexity
as
this
the
barbarians
suddenly
encompassed
them
from
all
sides
at
once
coming
through
the
thickest
part
of
the
underbrush
since
they
were
acquainted
with
the
paths
at
first
they
hurled
from
a
distance
then
as
no
one
defended
himself
but
many
were
wounded
they
approached
closer
to
them
the
romans
were
in
no
order
but
going
along
among
the
wagons
and
the
unarmed
and
so
not
being
able
to
form
readily
in
a
body
and
being
fewer
at
every
point
than
their
assailants
they
suffered
greatly
and
offered
no
resistance
at
all
accordingly
they
encamped
on
the
spot
after
securing
a
suitable
place
so
far
as
that
was
possible
on
a
wooded
mountain
and
afterward
they
either
burned
or
abandoned
the
majority
of
their
wagons
and
everything
else
that
was
not
absolutely
necessary
for
them
the
next
day
they
advanced
in
better
order
with
the
aim
of
reaching
open
country
but
they
did
not
gain
it
without
loss
from
there
they
went
forward
and
plunged
into
the
woods
again
defending
themselves
against
the
attacks
but
endured
no
inconsiderable
reverses
in
this
very
operation
for
whereas
they
were
marshaled
in
a
narrow
place
in
order
that
cavalry
and
men
in
a
mass
might
run
down
their
foes
they
had
many
collisions
with
one
another
and
with
the
trees
dawn
of
the
fourth
day
broke
as
they
were
advancing
and
again
a
violent
downpour
and
mighty
wind
attacked
them
which
would
not
allow
them
to
go
forward
or
even
to
stand
securely
and
actually
deprived
them
of
the
use
of
their
weapons
they
could
not
manage
successfully
their
arrows
or
their
javelins
or
indeed
their
shields
which
were
soaked
through
the
enemy
however
being
for
the
most
part
lightly
equipped
and
with
power
to
approach
and
retire
freely
suffered
less
from
the
effects
of
the
storm
numbers
moreover
increased
as
numbers
of
those
who
had
at
first
wavered
joined
them
particularly
for
the
sake
of
plunder
and
so
they
could
more
easily
encircle
and
strike
down
the
romans
who
were
already
few
many
having
perished
in
the
previous
battles
varus
therefore
and
the
most
eminent
of
the
other
leaders
fearing
that
they
might
either
be
taken
alive
or
be
killed
by
their
bitterest
foes
for
they
had
been
wounded
dared
do
a
deed
which
was
frightful
but
not
to
be
avoided
they
killed
themselves
when
this
news
was
spread
none
of
the
rest
even
if
he
had
strength
still
left
defended
himself
longer
some
imitated
their
leader
others
throwing
aside
their
arms
allowed
who
pleased
to
slay
them
to
flee
was
impossible
however
one
might
wish
it
every
man
and
horse
therefore
was
cut
down
without
resistance
and
the
and
the
barbarians
occupied
all
the
strongholds
save
one
delay
over
which
prevented
them
from
either
crossing
the
rhine
or
invading
gaul
yet
they
found
themselves
unable
to
reduce
this
particular
fort
because
they
did
not
understand
the
conduct
of
sieges
and
because
the
romans
employed
numerous
archers
who
repeatedly
repulsed
them
and
from
first
to
last
destroyed
a
large
proportion
of
the
attacking
party
later
they
learned
that
the
romans
had
posted
a
guard
at
the
rhine
and
that
tiberius
was
approaching
with
an
imposing
force
of
fighters
therefore
most
of
the
barbarians
retired
from
the
fortress
and
the
detachment
still
left
there
withdrew
some
distance
away
so
as
not
to
be
damaged
by
sudden
sallies
of
the
men
inside
and
they
kept
watch
of
the
roads
hoping
to
capture
the
garrison
through
scarcity
of
food
supplies
the
romans
within
so
long
as
they
had
abundance
of
sustenance
remained
where
they
were
awaiting
relief
but
when
no
one
came
to
their
assistance
and
they
were
likewise
a
prey
to
hunger
they
watched
for
a
stormy
night
and
issued
forth
the
soldiers
were
but
fed
the
unarmed
many
and
they
passed
the
first
and
second
guard
of
their
adversaries
but
when
they
reached
the
third
they
were
detected
for
on
account
of
fatigue
and
fear
and
the
darkness
and
cold
the
women
and
children
kept
calling
to
the
men
of
fighting
age
to
come
back
they
would
all
have
perished
or
been
captured
had
not
the
barbarians
been
so
busily
occupied
with
seizing
the
plunder
this
gave
an
opportunity
for
many
of
the
most
hardy
to
get
some
distance
off
and
the
trumpeters
with
them
by
sounding
the
signal
for
a
double
quick
march
caused
the
enemy
to
think
for
night
was
coming
on
and
they
could
not
be
seen
that
they
had
been
sent
from
asprenas
therefore
the
foe
ceased
their
pursuit
and
asprenas
on
learning
what
was
taking
place
rendered
them
assistance
in
reality
some
of
the
captives
were
later
ransomed
by
their
relatives
and
returned
for
this
was
permitted
on
condition
that
the
ransoming
party
should
be
outside
of
italy
at
the
but
this
was
only
afterward
at
the
time
when
augustus
heard
of
the
disaster
to
varus
he
rent
his
clothing
as
some
assert
and
mourned
greatly
over
the
lost
soldiers
as
also
over
the
fear
inspired
by
the
germans
and
the
gauls
his
grief
was
especially
keen
because
he
expected
that
they
would
march
upon
italy
and
upon
rome
itself
there
were
no
citizens
of
military
age
worth
mentioning
that
were
left
and
the
allied
forces
that
were
of
any
value
had
been
ruined
nevertheless
he
made
preparations
as
well
as
he
could
in
view
of
the
circumstances
and
when
no
one
of
the
proper
age
for
warfare
showed
a
willingness
to
be
enrolled
he
instituted
a
drawing
of
lots
and
deprived
of
his
property
every
fifth
man
to
draw
of
those
not
yet
years
old
and
every
tenth
man
among
those
who
were
older
besides
disenfranchising
them
finally
as
very
many
paid
no
heed
to
him
even
then
he
put
some
to
death
he
chose
by
lot
as
many
as
he
could
of
those
who
had
already
finished
their
service
and
of
the
freedmen
and
having
enrolled
them
sent
them
at
once
in
haste
with
tiberius
into
germany
and
as
there
were
in
rome
a
number
of
gauls
and
celtæ
sojourning
there
for
various
purposes
and
some
of
them
serving
in
the
pretorian
guard
he
feared
that
they
might
commit
some
act
of
insurrection
therefore
he
sent
such
as
were
in
his
guard
off
to
the
islands
and
ordered
the
unarmed
class
to
leave
the
city
this
was
the
way
be
busied
himself
at
that
time
and
none
of
the
usual
business
went
on
nor
were
the
festivals
celebrated
after
this
when
he
heard
that
some
of
the
soldiers
had
been
saved
that
the
germanies
were
garrisoned
and
the
enemy
did
not
dare
to
come
down
even
to
the
rhine
he
ceased
to
be
excited
and
stopped
to
consider
the
matter
a
catastrophe
so
great
and
prostrating
as
this
it
seemed
to
him
could
have
been
due
to
nothing
else
than
the
wrath
of
some
divinity
moreover
by
reason
of
the
portents
which
took
place
both
before
the
defeat
and
afterward
he
was
greatly
inclined
to
suspect
some
miraculous
working
the
temple
of
mars
in
the
field
of
the
same
name
had
been
struck
by
lightning
and
many
locusts
that
flew
into
the
very
city
were
devoured
by
swallows
the
peaks
of
the
alps
seemed
to
totter
toward
one
another
and
to
send
up
three
fiery
columns
the
sky
in
many
places
appeared
ablaze
and
at
the
same
time
numerous
comet
stars
came
to
view
spears
darting
from
the
north
seemed
to
be
falling
upon
the
roman
camp
bees
formed
their
combs
about
roman
altars
a
statue
of
victory
which
was
in
germany
facing
hostile
territory
turned
about
toward
italy
and
once
an
aimless
battle
and
conflict
of
the
soldiers
occurred
about
the
eagles
in
the
camps
as
if
the
barbarians
had
fallen
upon
them
for
these
reasons
then
and
also
because
tiberius
did
not
see
fit
to
cross
the
rhine
but
kept
quiet
watching
to
see
that
the
barbarians
should
not
do
so
the
latter
however
knowing
him
to
be
present
did
not
venture
to
cross
either
germanicus
was
endeared
to
the
populace
for
many
causes
but
particularly
because
he
interceded
for
various
persons
and
this
quite
as
much
in
the
presence
of
augustus
himself
as
before
other
justices
now
there
was
a
court
to
try
a
quæstor
who
was
charged
with
murder
and
as
germanicus
was
going
to
be
his
advocate
his
accuser
became
alarmed
lest
he
might
consequently
meet
with
defeat
before
those
judges
in
whose
presence
such
cases
were
wont
to
be
tried
and
he
desired
to
have
augustus
preside
yet
his
efforts
were
vain
for
he
did
not
win
his
case
holding
it
after
his
prætorship
but
in
the
following
season
the
temple
of
concord
was
dedicated
by
tiberius
and
both
his
name
and
that
of
drusus
his
dead
brother
were
inscribed
upon
it
in
the
consulship
of
marcus
æmilius
with
statilius
taurus
tiberius
and
germanicus
acting
as
proconsul
invaded
celtica
and
overran
some
parts
of
it
they
did
not
conquer
however
in
any
battle
since
no
one
came
to
close
quarters
with
them
and
did
not
reduce
any
tribe
for
in
their
fear
of
falling
victims
to
a
new
disaster
they
advanced
not
far
beyond
the
rhine
but
after
remaining
there
until
late
autumn
and
celebrating
the
birthday
of
augustus
on
which
they
held
a
kind
of
under
the
direction
of
the
centurions
they
returned
at
rome
drusus
cæsar
the
son
of
tiberius
became
quæstor
and
sixteen
prætors
held
office
because
that
number
became
candidates
for
the
position
and
augustus
mindful
of
his
condition
was
unwilling
to
offend
any
of
them
the
same
did
not
hold
true
however
of
the
years
immediately
following
but
the
number
remained
twelve
for
a
long
period
besides
these
proceedings
the
seers
were
forbidden
to
prophesy
in
private
to
any
one
or
regarding
death
even
if
there
should
be
others
with
them
yet
in
this
matter
augustus
had
no
personal
feeling
so
that
by
a
bulletin
he
even
published
to
all
the
conjunction
of
stars
under
which
he
had
been
born
in
addition
to
forbidding
the
above
he
proclaimed
to
subject
states
that
they
should
grant
no
honors
to
any
one
assigned
to
govern
them
either
during
his
term
of
office
or
within
sixty
days
after
he
had
departed
for
some
governors
by
arranging
for
testimonials
and
eulogies
from
their
subjects
were
doing
much
harm
three
senators
as
before
transacted
business
with
the
embassies
and
the
knights
a
fact
which
might
cause
surprise
were
allowed
to
fight
as
gladiators
the
reason
was
that
some
persisted
in
disregarding
the
disenfranchisement
stated
as
a
penalty
for
such
conduct
and
as
there
proved
to
be
no
use
in
forbidding
it
and
the
participants
seemed
to
require
a
greater
punishment
before
they
would
be
turned
aside
from
this
course
they
were
given
permission
to
do
as
they
liked
in
this
way
they
incurred
death
instead
of
disenfranchisement
for
they
fought
more
than
ever
and
especially
because
their
contests
were
centers
of
attraction
so
that
even
augustus
became
a
spectator
in
company
with
the
prætors
who
superintended
games
germanicus
soon
after
received
the
office
of
consul
though
he
had
not
even
been
prætor
and
held
it
actually
throughout
the
whole
year
not
because
of
fitness
but
as
a
number
of
others
held
office
at
that
time
the
consul
did
nothing
worthy
of
note
save
that
at
this
time
too
he
acted
as
advocate
in
suits
since
his
colleague
gaius
capito
counted
as
a
mere
figurehead
augustus
because
he
was
growing
old
wrote
a
letter
commending
germanicus
to
the
senate
and
the
latter
to
tiberius
the
manuscript
was
not
read
by
him
in
person
for
he
was
unable
to
make
himself
heard
but
by
germanicus
as
usual
after
that
he
asked
them
making
the
celtic
war
his
excuse
not
to
come
to
greet
him
at
home
nor
to
be
angry
if
he
did
not
continue
to
eat
with
them
for
generally
as
often
as
they
had
a
sitting
in
the
forum
and
sometimes
in
the
itself
they
saluted
him
when
he
entered
and
again
when
he
left
and
it
had
already
happened
that
when
he
was
sitting
and
sometimes
lying
down
in
the
palatium
not
only
the
senate
but
the
knights
and
many
of
the
populace
greeted
him
all
this
time
he
continued
to
attend
to
his
business
as
before
he
allowed
the
knights
to
become
candidates
for
the
tribuneship
and
learning
that
vituperative
books
concerning
certain
men
were
being
written
he
ordered
a
search
for
them
those
that
he
found
in
the
city
he
had
burned
by
the
ædiles
and
those
outside
by
the
officials
who
might
be
in
charge
and
he
visited
punishment
upon
some
of
the
composers
as
there
were
many
exiles
who
were
either
carrying
on
their
occupations
outsides
of
the
places
to
which
they
had
been
banished
or
living
too
luxuriously
in
the
proper
places
he
forbade
that
any
one
who
had
been
debarred
from
fire
and
water
should
stay
either
on
the
mainland
or
on
any
of
the
islands
distant
less
than
four
hundred
stadia
from
the
mainland
only
he
made
an
exception
of
cos
rhodes
samos
and
lesbos
for
what
reason
i
know
not
he
enjoined
upon
them
also
that
they
should
not
cross
the
seas
to
any
other
point
and
should
not
possess
more
than
one
ship
of
burden
having
a
capacity
of
one
thousand
amphoræ
and
two
driven
by
oars
that
they
should
not
employ
more
than
twenty
slaves
or
freedmen
that
they
should
not
hold
property
above
twelve
and
a
half
myriads
and
he
threatened
to
take
vengeance
upon
them
for
any
violation
as
well
as
upon
all
others
who
should
in
any
way
assist
them
in
violating
these
ordinances
these
are
the
laws
as
fully
as
is
necessary
for
our
history
that
he
laid
down
a
festival
extraordinary
was
conducted
by
the
dancers
and
the
feast
of
mars
because
the
tiber
had
previously
occupied
the
hipprodrome
was
this
time
held
in
the
forum
of
augustus
and
honored
by
a
kind
of
and
by
the
slaughter
of
wild
beasts
it
was
celebrated
a
second
time
as
custom
decreed
and
germanicus
on
that
occasion
killed
two
hundred
lions
in
the
hippodrome
the
portico
of
julia
was
built
in
honor
of
gaius
and
lucius
the
cæsars
and
was
at
that
time
dedicated
when
lucius
munatius
and
gaius
silius
had
been
registered
as
consuls
augustus
reluctantly
accepted
the
fifth
decennial
presidency
of
the
state
and
gave
tiberius
again
the
tribunician
authority
to
drusus
the
latter
son
he
granted
permission
to
stand
for
the
consulship
a
third
year
still
without
having
held
the
prætorship
and
for
himself
he
asked
twenty
annual
counselors
because
of
his
old
age
which
did
not
permit
him
to
visit
the
senate
any
longer
save
rarely
previously
fifteen
were
attached
to
him
for
six
months
it
was
further
voted
that
any
measure
should
have
authority
as
satisfactory
to
the
whole
senate
which
should
after
deliberation
be
resolved
upon
by
him
in
conjunction
with
tiberius
and
with
the
consuls
of
the
year
with
the
men
appointed
for
deliberation
and
his
grandchildren
the
adopted
ones
of
course
and
the
others
that
he
might
on
any
occasion
call
upon
for
advice
gaining
by
the
decree
those
powers
which
in
reality
he
had
in
any
case
he
transacted
most
of
the
is
necessary
business
though
sometimes
lying
down
now
as
nearly
all
felt
oppressed
by
the
five
per
cent
tax
and
a
political
convulsion
seemed
likely
he
sent
document
to
the
senate
bidding
its
members
seek
some
other
means
of
income
this
he
did
not
in
the
intention
of
abolishing
the
tax
but
in
order
that
when
no
other
appeared
to
them
preferable
they
might
though
reluctantly
ratify
it
without
declaiming
against
him
he
also
ordered
germanicus
and
drusus
not
to
make
any
official
statement
about
it
for
fear
that
if
they
expressed
an
opinion
persons
would
suspect
that
this
had
been
done
by
his
orders
and
choose
that
plan
without
further
investigation
there
was
much
discussion
and
some
schemes
were
submitted
to
augustus
in
writing
when
he
found
by
them
that
the
senators
were
ready
to
endure
any
form
of
tax
rather
than
that
in
force
he
changed
it
to
a
levy
upon
fields
and
houses
and
without
telling
how
great
it
would
be
or
in
what
way
imposed
he
immediately
sent
men
in
different
directions
to
make
a
list
of
the
possessions
both
of
individuals
and
of
towns
his
object
was
that
they
should
fear
losses
on
a
large
scale
and
so
be
content
to
pay
the
five
per
cent
this
actually
happened
and
so
it
was
that
augustus
settled
the
difficulty
at
the
spectacle
of
the
augustalia
which
occurred
on
his
birthday
a
madman
seated
himself
in
the
chair
which
was
dedicated
to
julius
cæsar
and
taking
his
crown
put
it
on
this
happening
disturbed
everybody
for
it
seemed
to
have
some
bearing
upon
augustus
as
indeed
proved
true
for
the
following
year
when
sextus
apuleius
and
sextus
pompeius
were
consuls
augustus
set
out
for
campania
and
after
superintending
the
games
at
naples
soon
passed
away
in
nola
omens
had
appeared
to
him
not
few
by
any
means
nor
difficult
to
interpret
that
pointed
to
this
end
the
sun
suffered
a
total
eclipse
and
most
of
the
sky
seemed
to
be
on
fire
the
forms
of
glowing
logs
appeared
falling
from
it
and
bloody
comet
stars
were
seen
when
a
had
been
announced
on
account
of
his
sickness
in
order
that
they
might
offer
prayers
the
was
found
closed
and
an
owl
sitting
upon
it
hooted
a
thunderbolt
fell
upon
his
image
standing
on
the
capitol
and
erased
the
first
letter
of
the
name
of
cæsar
this
led
the
seers
to
declare
that
on
the
hundredth
day
after
that
he
should
attain
to
some
heavenly
condition
they
made
this
deduction
from
the
fact
that
the
letter
mentioned
signifies
hundred
among
the
latins
and
all
the
rest
of
the
name
means
god
among
the
etruscans
these
signs
appeared
while
he
was
still
alive
men
of
later
times
called
attention
to
the
case
of
the
consuls
and
of
servius
sulpicius
galba
the
former
officials
were
in
some
way
related
to
augustus
and
galba
who
afterward
came
to
power
was
at
this
time
on
the
very
first
day
of
the
year
enrolled
among
the
iuvenes
since
he
was
the
first
of
the
romans
to
become
sovereign
after
the
race
of
augustus
had
passed
away
it
gave
occasion
to
some
to
say
that
this
coincidence
had
not
been
due
to
mere
accident
but
had
been
brought
about
by
some
divine
counsel
so
augustus
fell
sick
and
died
livia
incurred
some
suspicion
regarding
the
manner
of
his
death
inasmuch
as
he
had
secretly
sailed
over
to
the
island
to
meet
agrippa
and
thought
to
reconcile
everything
in
a
way
satisfactory
to
all
she
was
afraid
some
say
that
augustus
would
bring
him
back
to
make
him
sovereign
and
so
smeared
with
poison
some
figs
that
were
still
on
trees
from
which
augustus
was
wont
to
gather
fruit
with
his
own
hands
so
she
ate
the
ones
that
had
not
been
smeared
and
pointed
out
the
poisoned
ones
to
him
from
this
or
from
some
other
cause
he
became
ill
and
sending
for
his
associates
he
told
them
all
his
wishes
finally
adding
rome
was
clay
when
i
took
it
in
hand
i
leave
it
to
you
stone
in
this
he
had
reference
not
entirely
to
the
appearance
of
its
buildings
but
also
to
the
strength
of
the
empire
by
asking
some
applause
from
them
as
to
comic
actors
at
the
close
of
some
mime
he
ridiculed
most
tellingly
the
whole
life
of
man
thus
on
the
nineteenth
day
of
august
the
day
on
which
he
first
became
consul
he
passed
away
having
lived
years
ten
months
and
days
he
had
been
born
on
the
of
september
he
reigned
as
monarch
from
the
time
he
conquered
at
actium
years
lacking
thirteen
days
his
death
however
was
not
immediately
made
public
livia
fearing
that
as
tiberius
was
still
in
dalmatia
there
might
be
some
uprising
concealed
the
fact
until
the
latter
arrived
this
is
the
statement
made
in
the
larger
number
of
histories
and
the
more
trustworthy
ones
there
are
some
who
have
affirmed
that
tiberius
was
present
during
the
emperor
illness
and
received
some
injunctions
from
the
body
of
augustus
was
carried
from
nola
by
the
foremost
men
of
each
city
in
succession
when
it
came
near
rome
the
knights
took
it
in
charge
and
conveyed
it
by
night
into
the
city
on
the
following
day
there
was
a
and
to
it
the
majority
came
wearing
the
equestrian
costume
but
the
officials
the
senatorial
except
for
the
togas
tiberius
and
drusus
his
son
wore
dark
clothing
made
in
everyday
fashion
they
too
offered
incense
but
made
no
use
of
a
flute
player
most
of
the
members
sat
in
their
accustomed
places
but
the
consuls
below
one
on
the
prætors
bench
and
one
on
the
tribunes
after
this
tiberius
was
absolved
for
having
touched
the
corpse
a
forbidden
act
and
for
having
escorted
it
on
its
way
although
the
his
will
drusus
took
from
the
virgin
priestesses
of
vesta
with
whom
it
had
been
deposited
and
carried
it
into
the
senate
those
who
had
sealed
it
viewed
the
impressions
and
then
it
was
read
in
hearing
of
the
senate
one
polybius
of
cæsar
household
read
his
will
as
it
was
not
proper
for
a
senator
to
read
anything
of
the
sort
it
showed
that
of
the
inheritance
had
been
left
to
tiberius
and
the
rest
to
livia
at
least
this
is
one
report
in
order
that
she
too
might
have
the
benefit
of
his
property
he
had
asked
permission
of
the
senate
to
leave
her
so
much
since
it
was
contrary
to
law
these
two
were
mentioned
as
inheritors
he
ordered
many
objects
and
sums
of
money
to
be
given
to
many
different
persons
both
relatives
of
his
and
those
joined
by
no
ties
of
kindred
not
only
to
senators
and
knights
but
also
to
kings
for
the
people
there
were
a
thousand
myriads
and
for
the
soldiers
two
hundred
and
fifty
denarii
apiece
to
the
pretorians
half
that
amount
to
the
city
force
and
to
the
remainder
of
the
native
soldiery
each
moreover
in
the
case
of
children
of
whose
fathers
he
had
been
the
heir
while
they
were
still
small
he
enjoined
that
everything
together
with
income
should
be
given
back
to
them
when
they
became
men
this
was
indeed
his
custom
while
in
life
whenever
he
inherited
the
estate
of
any
one
who
had
offspring
he
never
neglected
to
give
it
all
to
the
children
immediately
if
they
were
already
adults
and
later
if
it
were
otherwise
though
he
took
such
an
attitude
toward
other
people
children
he
did
not
restore
his
daughter
from
exile
though
he
deemed
her
worthy
of
gifts
and
he
forbade
her
being
buried
in
his
own
so
much
was
learned
from
the
will
four
books
were
then
brought
in
and
drusus
read
them
in
the
first
were
written
details
pertaining
to
his
funeral
in
the
second
all
the
works
which
he
had
done
which
he
commanded
to
be
inscribed
aloft
upon
bronze
columns
to
be
set
around
his
heroum
the
third
contained
an
account
of
military
matters
of
the
revenues
and
of
the
public
expenditures
the
amount
of
money
in
the
treasuries
and
everything
else
of
the
sort
having
a
bearing
upon
the
administration
and
the
fourth
had
injunctions
and
orders
for
tiberius
and
for
the
public
among
these
last
was
a
command
that
they
should
not
liberate
many
slaves
and
should
thus
avoid
filing
the
city
with
a
variegated
rabble
he
also
exhorted
them
not
to
enroll
large
numbers
as
citizens
in
order
that
there
might
be
a
distinct
difference
between
themselves
and
subject
nations
to
deliver
the
control
of
public
business
to
all
who
had
ability
both
to
understand
and
to
act
and
never
to
let
it
depend
on
any
one
person
in
this
way
no
one
would
set
his
mind
on
a
tyranny
nor
would
the
state
go
to
pieces
if
one
fell
he
advised
them
to
be
satisfied
with
present
possessions
and
under
no
conditions
to
wish
to
increase
the
empire
to
any
greater
dimensions
it
would
be
hard
to
guard
he
said
and
this
would
lead
to
danger
of
their
losing
what
was
already
theirs
this
principle
he
had
himself
really
always
followed
not
only
in
speech
but
also
in
action
for
whereas
he
might
have
made
great
acquisitions
of
barbarian
territory
he
had
not
wished
to
do
these
were
his
injunctions
then
came
his
funeral
there
was
a
couch
made
of
ivory
and
gold
and
adorned
with
robes
of
purple
mixed
with
gold
in
it
his
body
was
hidden
in
a
kind
of
box
down
below
a
wax
image
of
him
in
triumphal
garb
was
displayed
this
one
was
borne
from
the
palatium
by
the
officials
for
the
following
year
and
another
of
gold
from
the
and
still
another
upon
a
triumphal
chariot
behind
these
came
the
images
of
his
ancestors
and
of
his
deceased
relatives
except
of
cæsar
because
he
had
been
enrolled
among
the
heroes
and
those
of
other
romans
who
had
been
prominent
in
any
way
beginning
with
romulus
himself
an
image
of
pompey
the
great
was
also
seen
and
all
the
nations
he
had
acquired
each
represented
by
a
likeness
which
bore
some
local
characteristic
were
carried
in
procession
after
these
followed
all
the
remaining
objects
mentioned
above
when
the
couch
had
been
placed
in
view
upon
the
platform
drusus
read
something
from
that
place
and
from
the
other
the
rostra
of
the
julian
shrine
tiberius
delivered
the
following
public
oration
over
the
deceased
according
to
a
decree
what
needed
to
be
said
privately
by
relatives
over
the
divine
augustus
drusus
has
spoken
but
since
the
senate
has
wisely
deemed
him
worthy
of
some
kind
of
public
utterance
i
know
that
the
speech
was
fittingly
entrusted
to
me
to
whom
more
justly
than
to
me
his
child
and
successor
could
be
the
task
of
praising
him
be
confided
it
is
not
my
privilege
however
to
be
gladdened
by
the
thought
that
my
ability
must
prove
no
whit
inferior
to
your
desires
in
the
matter
and
to
his
worth
indeed
if
i
were
to
speak
among
strangers
i
should
be
greatly
alarmed
lest
in
following
my
speech
they
should
believe
his
deeds
to
be
no
better
than
i
describe
them
as
it
is
i
am
encouraged
by
the
thought
that
my
words
will
be
directed
to
you
who
know
all
of
them
thoroughly
have
experienced
them
all
and
for
that
reason
have
deemed
him
worthy
of
these
very
praises
you
will
judge
of
his
excellence
not
from
what
i
may
say
but
from
what
you
yourselves
know
and
you
will
assist
my
discourse
making
good
what
is
deficient
by
your
memory
of
events
so
that
in
this
way
his
eulogy
will
become
a
public
one
given
by
all
as
i
like
the
head
of
some
chorus
indicate
the
chief
points
and
you
come
in
with
the
remainder
of
the
refrain
i
am
certainly
not
afraid
that
you
will
hold
me
guilty
of
weakness
because
i
am
unable
to
meet
your
desires
nor
that
you
will
be
jealous
to
see
his
excellence
going
beyond
your
reach
who
does
not
understand
the
fact
that
not
all
mankind
assembled
in
one
place
could
worthily
sound
his
praises
and
you
all
voluntarily
make
way
for
him
to
triumph
not
envious
to
think
that
not
one
of
you
could
equal
him
but
rejoicing
in
his
surpassing
greatness
the
greater
he
looms
up
before
you
the
more
greatly
will
you
feel
yourselves
benefited
so
that
envy
will
not
be
bred
in
you
by
your
inferiority
to
him
but
awe
from
the
advantages
you
have
received
at
his
hands
i
shall
begin
at
the
point
where
he
also
began
to
enter
politics
that
is
from
his
earliest
manhood
this
indeed
is
one
of
the
greatest
achievements
of
augustus
that
when
he
had
just
emerged
from
boyhood
and
was
entering
upon
the
state
of
youth
he
paid
attention
to
education
so
long
as
public
affairs
were
well
managed
by
the
famous
cæsar
the
when
after
the
conspiracy
against
the
latter
the
whole
commonwealth
was
thrown
into
confusion
he
at
the
same
time
amply
avenged
his
father
and
rendered
a
much
needed
aid
to
you
not
fearing
the
multitude
of
his
enemies
nor
dreading
the
greatness
of
the
business
nor
hesitating
through
his
own
immaturity
yet
what
deed
like
this
can
be
cited
of
alexander
of
macedon
or
our
romulus
who
have
the
reputation
of
having
done
something
brilliant
when
very
young
but
these
i
shall
pass
over
lest
from
merely
comparing
them
with
him
and
bringing
them
up
and
that
among
you
who
are
acquainted
with
him
no
less
than
i
i
may
be
thought
to
be
diminishing
the
greatness
of
augustus
if
i
am
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
i
should
be
justified
only
if
i
looked
at
his
deeds
beside
those
of
hercules
yet
even
then
i
should
fail
of
my
effect
inasmuch
as
the
latter
killed
only
serpents
when
he
was
a
child
a
stag
and
a
boar
when
he
was
a
man
oh
yes
and
by
jupiter
a
lion
also
though
reluctantly
and
in
obedience
to
a
command
whereas
our
hero
voluntarily
made
wars
and
enacted
laws
not
among
beasts
but
among
men
carefully
preserved
the
commonwealth
and
himself
gained
brilliance
it
was
for
this
that
you
chose
him
prætor
and
appointed
him
consul
at
that
age
when
some
are
unwilling
even
to
serve
in
the
army
this
was
the
beginning
of
political
life
for
augustus
and
it
is
the
beginning
of
my
speech
about
him
soon
after
seeing
that
the
largest
and
best
portion
both
of
the
people
and
of
the
senate
was
in
accord
with
him
but
that
lepidus
and
antony
sextus
brutus
and
cassius
were
employing
rebels
he
feared
that
the
city
might
become
involved
in
many
wars
civil
wars
at
once
and
be
so
torn
asunder
and
exhausted
as
not
to
be
able
to
revive
in
any
fashion
and
so
he
manipulated
them
very
cleverly
and
to
the
greatest
public
good
he
attached
himself
to
the
strong
ones
who
were
menacing
the
very
city
and
with
them
fought
the
others
till
he
made
an
end
of
them
when
these
were
out
of
the
way
he
in
turn
freed
us
from
the
former
he
chose
against
his
will
to
surrender
a
few
to
their
wrath
so
that
he
might
save
the
majority
and
he
chose
to
assume
a
friendly
attitude
toward
them
individually
so
as
not
to
have
to
fight
with
them
all
at
once
from
this
he
derived
no
individual
gain
but
aided
us
all
most
evidently
why
should
one
speak
at
length
to
enumerate
his
deeds
in
the
wars
both
at
home
and
abroad
consider
especially
that
the
former
ought
never
to
have
occurred
at
all
and
that
the
latter
by
the
conquests
gained
show
their
advantages
better
than
any
words
moreover
that
they
largely
depended
upon
chance
that
the
successes
were
obtained
with
the
aid
of
many
citizens
and
many
allies
so
that
these
deserve
the
credit
equally
with
him
and
finally
that
the
achievements
might
possibly
be
compared
with
those
of
some
others
these
accordingly
i
shall
put
aside
you
can
behold
and
read
them
inscribed
in
letters
and
characters
in
many
places
i
shall
speak
only
of
the
works
which
belong
to
augustus
himself
which
have
never
been
performed
by
any
other
man
and
have
not
only
caused
our
city
to
survive
from
many
dangers
of
a
sorts
but
have
rendered
it
more
prosperous
and
powerful
the
mention
of
them
will
confer
upon
him
a
unique
glory
and
will
afford
the
elder
among
you
an
innocent
pleasure
while
giving
the
younger
men
an
exact
instruction
in
the
character
and
constitution
of
the
government
this
augustus
then
whom
you
deemed
worthy
of
this
title
for
the
very
reasons
just
cited
as
soon
as
he
had
freed
himself
from
the
civil
wars
after
acting
and
enduring
not
in
a
way
that
pleased
himself
as
heaven
approved
first
of
all
preserved
the
lives
of
most
of
his
opponents
who
were
survivors
of
the
army
and
thus
he
in
no
way
imitated
sulla
called
the
fortunate
not
to
give
you
a
list
of
all
of
them
who
does
not
know
about
sosius
about
scaurus
the
brother
of
sextus
and
particularly
about
lepidus
who
lived
so
long
a
time
after
his
defeat
and
continued
to
be
high
priest
his
whole
life
through
next
he
honored
his
companions
in
conflict
with
many
great
gifts
but
did
not
allow
them
to
act
in
any
arrogant
way
or
to
be
wanton
you
know
thoroughly
among
others
in
this
category
both
mæcenas
and
agrippa
so
that
there
is
no
need
of
my
enumerating
the
names
augustus
had
two
qualities
too
which
were
never
united
in
any
one
else
some
conquerors
i
know
have
spared
their
enemies
and
others
have
refused
to
allow
their
companions
to
give
way
to
license
but
both
sorts
of
behavior
at
once
continually
without
any
exception
were
never
found
in
the
same
man
here
is
evidence
sulla
and
marius
treated
as
enemies
even
the
children
of
those
who
fought
against
them
why
need
i
cite
the
other
less
important
men
pompey
and
cæsar
were
in
general
guiltless
of
this
conduct
but
permitted
their
friends
to
do
not
a
few
things
that
were
contrary
to
their
own
principles
but
this
man
had
each
of
the
two
virtues
so
fused
and
intermingled
that
to
his
adversaries
he
made
defeat
look
like
victory
and
to
his
comrades
he
showed
a
happiness
in
excellence
after
doing
this
and
quieting
by
kindness
all
that
remained
of
factional
disputes
and
imposing
temperance
by
his
benefits
upon
the
victorious
military
he
might
as
a
result
of
this
and
the
weapons
and
the
money
at
his
command
have
been
indisputably
the
sole
lord
of
everything
as
indeed
he
had
been
made
by
the
very
course
of
events
yet
he
refused
and
like
a
good
physician
who
takes
in
hand
a
body
and
heals
it
he
restored
everything
to
you
after
making
it
well
and
to
what
this
action
amounted
you
can
best
realize
from
the
fact
that
our
fathers
spoke
in
praise
of
pompey
and
metellus
who
was
formerly
prominent
because
they
voluntarily
disbanded
the
forces
with
which
they
had
been
engaged
in
war
now
if
they
who
had
but
a
small
force
and
a
merely
temporary
one
and
besides
saw
opponents
who
would
not
allow
them
to
do
otherwise
if
they
received
praise
for
doing
this
how
could
one
speak
fittingly
of
the
magnanimity
of
augustus
he
held
all
your
forces
however
great
he
was
master
of
all
your
funds
vast
in
amount
had
no
one
to
fear
or
suspect
but
whereas
he
might
have
ruled
alone
with
the
approval
of
all
he
would
not
accept
such
a
course
but
laid
the
arms
the
provinces
the
money
at
your
feet
wherefore
you
with
wise
insistence
and
proper
prudence
would
not
have
it
nor
allow
him
to
retire
to
private
life
you
knew
well
that
democracy
would
never
accommodate
itself
to
such
tremendous
interests
but
that
the
superintendence
of
a
single
person
would
most
surely
preserve
them
and
so
refused
what
was
nominally
independence
but
really
factional
discord
and
making
choice
of
him
whom
you
had
proved
worthy
by
his
very
deeds
you
compelled
him
to
stand
at
your
head
for
a
time
at
least
when
you
had
in
this
way
tested
him
even
more
than
before
you
finally
forced
him
a
second
a
third
a
fourth
and
a
fifth
time
to
remain
as
manager
of
public
affairs
it
was
only
natural
who
would
not
choose
to
be
safe
without
trouble
to
be
prosperous
without
danger
to
enjoy
unsparingly
the
blessings
of
government
and
not
to
be
disturbed
by
cares
for
its
maintenance
who
was
there
that
could
rule
even
his
private
possessions
better
than
augustus
to
say
nothing
of
the
goods
of
so
many
human
beings
he
accepted
the
trying
and
hostile
provinces
for
his
own
portion
to
guard
and
preserve
but
restored
to
you
all
such
others
as
were
peaceful
and
free
from
danger
though
he
supported
such
a
large
standing
army
to
fight
in
your
behalf
he
let
the
soldiers
be
troublesome
to
none
of
his
own
countrymen
but
rendered
them
to
outsiders
most
terrifying
guardians
to
the
people
at
home
unarmed
and
unwarlike
the
senators
in
places
of
authority
were
not
deprived
of
appeal
to
the
lot
but
prizes
for
excellence
were
furnished
them
in
addition
he
did
not
destroy
the
power
of
the
ballot
in
their
decisions
and
he
guaranteed
safety
in
free
speech
as
well
cases
difficult
to
decide
he
transferred
from
the
people
to
the
searching
justice
of
the
courts
but
preserved
to
the
popular
body
the
dignity
of
the
elections
and
trained
citizens
in
these
to
seek
a
means
of
honor
not
of
strife
he
even
cut
away
the
ambitious
greed
of
office
seekers
and
put
a
regard
for
reputation
in
its
place
his
own
money
which
he
increased
by
legitimate
methods
he
spent
for
public
needs
for
the
public
funds
he
cared
as
if
they
were
his
own
while
he
refrained
from
touching
them
as
belonging
to
others
he
saw
that
all
public
works
that
were
falling
to
decay
were
repaired
and
deprived
no
one
connected
with
their
renovation
of
the
glory
attaching
many
structures
he
built
anew
some
in
his
own
name
some
in
that
of
another
or
else
gave
others
charge
of
erecting
them
consequently
his
gaze
was
directed
toward
public
utility
and
privately
he
grudged
no
one
the
fame
to
be
derived
from
public
service
wantonness
among
his
own
kin
he
recompensed
relentlessly
but
the
offences
of
others
he
treated
with
humaneness
those
who
had
traits
of
excellence
he
allowed
to
come
as
near
as
they
could
to
his
own
standard
and
with
the
conduct
of
such
as
lived
otherwise
he
did
not
concern
himself
minutely
among
those
who
conspired
against
him
he
invoked
justice
upon
only
those
whose
lives
were
of
no
profit
even
to
themselves
the
rest
he
placed
in
such
a
position
that
for
a
great
while
they
could
obtain
no
excuse
either
true
or
false
for
attacking
him
it
is
nothing
surprising
that
he
was
occasionally
the
object
of
conspiracies
for
even
the
gods
do
not
please
all
alike
the
excellence
of
good
rulers
is
discernible
not
in
the
villainies
of
others
but
in
their
own
good
behavior
i
have
spoken
quirites
of
his
greatest
and
most
striking
characteristics
in
a
rather
summary
way
for
if
one
should
desire
to
enumerate
all
of
his
great
points
individually
it
would
need
many
days
furthermore
i
know
that
though
you
will
have
heard
so
few
facts
from
me
they
will
lead
you
to
remember
for
yourselves
everything
else
and
it
will
seem
almost
as
if
i
had
spoken
that
too
in
the
rest
that
i
have
said
about
him
i
have
not
been
speaking
in
a
spirit
of
vainglory
nor
has
that
been
your
state
of
mind
in
listening
but
i
intended
that
his
many
noble
achievements
might
obtain
an
ever
memorable
glory
in
your
souls
who
would
not
feel
inclined
to
make
mention
of
his
senators
how
without
giving
offence
he
removed
the
scum
that
had
come
to
the
surface
from
the
factions
how
by
this
very
act
he
exalted
the
remainder
magnified
it
by
increasing
the
property
requirement
and
enriched
it
by
grants
of
money
how
he
voted
on
an
equality
with
the
senators
and
had
their
help
in
making
changes
how
he
communicated
to
them
all
the
greatest
and
most
important
matters
either
in
the
or
else
at
his
house
whither
he
called
different
members
at
different
times
because
of
his
age
and
bodily
infirmity
who
would
not
like
to
cite
the
condition
of
the
rest
of
the
romans
before
whom
he
set
public
works
money
games
festivals
amnesty
an
abundance
of
food
safety
not
only
from
the
enemy
and
evildoers
but
even
from
the
acts
of
heaven
nor
such
alone
as
befall
by
day
but
by
night
as
well
or
again
the
allies
how
he
made
their
freedom
free
from
danger
and
their
alliance
to
involve
no
loss
or
the
subject
nations
how
no
one
of
them
was
treated
with
insolence
or
abuse
how
can
one
forget
a
man
who
was
in
private
life
poor
in
public
life
rich
saving
in
his
own
case
but
liberal
of
expenditures
for
others
one
who
even
endured
all
toil
and
danger
for
you
but
would
not
submit
to
your
escorting
him
when
he
went
forth
on
any
expedition
or
to
your
meeting
him
when
he
returned
one
who
on
festivals
admitted
even
the
populace
to
his
home
but
on
other
days
greeted
even
the
senate
only
in
its
chambers
how
could
one
forget
the
number
and
precision
as
well
of
his
laws
which
contained
for
the
wronged
an
consolation
and
for
the
wrongdoers
a
not
inhuman
punishment
or
his
rewards
offered
to
those
who
married
and
had
children
or
the
prizes
given
to
the
soldiers
without
disadvantage
to
any
other
person
then
there
is
the
fact
of
his
being
satisfied
with
our
possessions
once
for
all
acquired
by
the
will
of
destiny
and
his
refusal
to
subjugate
additional
territory
for
while
imagining
that
we
bore
a
wider
sway
we
might
meantime
lose
all
we
had
you
recall
how
he
always
shared
the
joys
and
sorrows
the
jests
and
earnestness
of
his
intimate
friends
and
allowed
absolutely
all
who
could
make
any
useful
suggestion
to
feel
free
to
speak
how
he
praised
those
who
spoke
the
truth
and
hated
flatterers
how
he
bestowed
upon
many
large
sums
from
his
own
means
and
how
when
aught
was
bequeathed
to
him
by
men
with
children
he
restored
it
all
to
those
children
what
oblivion
is
dark
enough
to
bury
all
this
it
was
for
this
therefore
i
say
that
you
naturally
made
him
your
head
and
a
father
of
the
people
that
you
decked
him
with
many
marks
of
esteem
and
numerous
consulships
and
finally
declared
him
a
hero
and
published
him
as
immortal
hence
we
ought
not
either
to
mourn
for
him
but
to
give
his
body
back
now
in
due
time
to
nature
and
to
glorify
his
spirit
as
that
of
a
god
forever
this
was
what
tiberius
read
directly
after
the
same
men
as
before
took
up
the
couch
and
carried
it
through
the
triumphal
gateway
according
to
the
senate
decree
there
were
present
and
took
part
in
carrying
him
out
the
senate
and
the
equestrian
class
the
women
of
his
family
and
the
pretorian
guard
and
nearly
everybody
else
in
the
city
was
in
attendance
when
the
body
had
been
placed
on
the
pyre
in
the
campus
martius
all
the
priests
marched
about
it
first
and
then
the
knights
all
the
magistrates
and
others
and
the
force
for
garrison
duty
ran
around
it
and
they
cast
upon
it
all
the
triumphal
decorations
which
any
of
them
had
ever
received
from
him
for
any
deed
of
valor
next
the
centurions
took
torches
conformably
to
a
decree
of
the
senate
and
kindled
the
fire
from
beneath
so
it
was
consumed
and
an
eagle
released
from
it
flew
aloft
appearing
to
bear
his
spirit
into
heaven
when
this
had
been
accomplished
most
of
those
present
departed
but
livia
remained
on
the
spot
for
five
days
in
company
with
the
most
prominent
knights
and
gathered
his
bones
which
she
placed
in
the
monument
the
show
of
grief
required
by
law
was
prolonged
only
for
a
few
days
by
the
men
but
by
the
women
according
to
a
decree
for
a
whole
year
real
grief
not
in
the
hearts
of
many
at
the
time
but
later
felt
by
all
the
citizens
augustus
had
been
accessible
to
all
and
was
accustomed
to
aid
many
persons
in
the
matter
of
money
he
used
to
bestow
honors
scrupulously
upon
his
friends
and
delighted
exceedingly
to
have
them
speak
frankly
one
instance
in
addition
to
what
has
been
told
occurred
in
the
case
of
athenodorus
the
latter
was
once
brought
into
his
room
in
a
covered
litter
as
if
it
were
some
woman
and
leaping
from
it
sword
in
hand
asked
are
you
afraid
that
some
one
may
come
in
this
way
and
kill
you
instead
of
being
angry
augustus
thanked
him
for
his
suggestion
the
people
consequently
were
wont
to
recall
these
traits
of
his
and
how
he
did
not
get
blindly
enraged
at
those
who
injured
him
as
well
as
how
he
kept
faith
with
even
such
as
were
unworthy
of
it
there
was
a
robber
named
corocotta
who
flourished
in
spain
and
the
emperor
was
in
the
first
place
so
angry
at
him
that
he
offered
myriads
to
the
man
that
captured
him
alive
later
the
robber
came
to
him
of
his
own
accord
and
he
not
only
did
him
no
harm
but
made
him
richer
by
the
amount
of
money
mentioned
hence
the
romans
missed
him
mightily
for
these
reasons
as
well
as
because
by
mingling
monarchy
with
democracy
he
preserved
their
freedom
for
them
and
secured
orderliness
and
security
so
that
their
lives
free
from
the
audacities
of
democracy
free
from
the
wantonness
of
tyrannies
were
cast
in
a
liberty
of
moderation
and
under
a
monarchy
without
terrors
they
were
subjects
of
royalty
yet
not
slaves
and
democratic
citizens
without
discord
if
any
of
them
remembered
his
former
deeds
in
the
course
of
the
civil
wars
they
laid
them
to
the
pressure
of
circumstances
and
they
thought
it
fair
to
look
for
his
real
disposition
which
had
given
him
undisputed
authority
this
offered
in
truth
a
mighty
contrast
any
one
who
goes
carefully
into
each
of
his
separate
actions
will
find
this
true
in
regard
to
the
mass
of
them
i
must
record
curtly
that
he
stopped
all
factional
disputes
transformed
the
government
in
a
way
to
give
it
power
and
strengthened
it
greatly
therefore
if
any
deed
of
violence
is
encountered
as
is
often
bound
to
happen
when
the
face
of
a
situation
shifts
unexpectedly
one
might
more
justly
blame
the
circumstances
themselves
than
him
not
the
smallest
factor
in
his
glory
was
the
length
of
his
reign
the
majority
of
those
that
had
lived
under
a
democracy
and
the
more
powerful
had
time
to
die
those
who
were
left
knowing
nothing
of
that
form
of
government
and
having
been
reared
entirely
or
mostly
under
existing
conditions
were
not
only
not
displeased
with
them
they
had
become
so
familiar
but
took
delight
in
them
for
they
saw
that
these
were
better
and
more
free
from
terror
than
others
of
which
they
heard
though
the
people
knew
this
during
his
life
they
nevertheless
realized
it
more
fully
after
his
decease
human
nature
is
so
constituted
that
in
good
fortune
it
does
not
perceive
its
prosperity
so
fully
as
it
misses
it
when
evil
days
arrive
this
was
the
case
then
in
regard
to
augustus
when
they
found
his
successor
tiberius
not
the
same
sort
of
man
they
longed
for
the
previous
emperor
persons
with
their
wits
about
them
had
some
immediate
evidence
of
the
change
in
the
constitution
the
consul
pompeius
who
went
out
to
meet
the
men
bearing
the
body
of
augustus
received
a
blow
in
the
leg
and
had
to
be
carried
back
with
the
body
an
owl
sat
over
the
again
at
the
very
first
sitting
of
the
senate
after
his
death
and
uttered
many
cries
the
two
men
differed
so
from
each
other
that
some
suspected
that
augustus
with
full
knowledge
of
tiberius
character
had
purposely
appointed
him
for
successor
to
the
end
that
he
himself
might
have
greater
glory
this
began
to
be
rumored
at
a
later
date
at
this
time
they
declared
augustus
immortal
and
assigned
to
him
attendants
and
sacred
rites
making
livia
who
was
already
called
julia
and
augusta
his
priestess
permission
was
granted
livia
to
employ
a
lictor
during
the
services
and
she
bestowed
upon
a
certain
numerius
atticus
a
senatorial
exprætor
myriads
because
he
swore
that
he
had
seen
augustus
ascending
into
heaven
after
the
manner
described
in
the
cases
of
proclus
and
of
romulus
a
heroüm
voted
by
the
senate
and
built
by
livia
and
tiberius
was
erected
to
the
dead
emperor
in
rome
and
others
at
many
different
points
sometimes
with
the
consent
of
the
nations
concerned
and
sometimes
without
their
consent
also
the
house
at
nola
where
he
passed
away
was
dedicated
to
him
as
a
precinct
while
the
heroüm
was
being
built
in
rome
they
placed
a
golden
image
of
him
upon
a
couch
in
the
temple
of
mars
and
to
this
they
paid
all
the
honors
that
they
were
afterward
to
give
to
his
statue
other
votes
in
regard
to
him
were
that
his
image
should
not
be
borne
in
procession
at
any
funeral
and
the
consuls
should
celebrate
his
birthday
with
games
no
less
than
that
of
mars
the
tribunes
as
being
sacrosanct
were
to
manage
the
augustalia
these
officials
conducted
everything
as
had
been
the
custom
wearing
the
triumphal
costume
at
the
they
did
not
however
ascend
the
chariot
besides
this
livia
held
a
private
festival
in
his
honor
for
three
days
in
the
palatium
and
this
is
continued
to
the
present
day
by
whoever
is
emperor
this
was
the
extent
of
the
decrees
passed
in
memory
of
augustus
nominally
by
the
senate
but
really
by
tiberius
and
livia
various
men
made
various
motions
and
they
decided
that
tiberius
should
receive
written
proposals
from
them
and
pick
out
whatever
he
chose
i
have
added
the
name
of
livia
because
she
took
a
share
in
the
proceedings
as
though
she
had
full
power
meantime
the
populace
was
plunged
in
tumult
because
at
the
augustalia
one
of
the
dancers
would
not
enter
the
theatre
for
the
stipulated
pay
they
did
not
cease
their
disturbances
until
the
tribunes
convened
the
senate
without
delay
and
begged
that
body
to
allow
them
to
spend
something

tiberius
was
a
patrician
of
good
education
but
he
had
a
most
peculiar
nature
he
never
let
what
he
desired
appear
in
his
talk
and
about
what
he
said
he
wished
he
usually
cared
nothing
at
all
thus
his
words
indicated
just
the
opposite
of
his
real
purpose
be
denied
any
interest
in
what
he
longed
for
and
urged
the
claims
of
what
he
hated
he
would
exhibit
anger
over
matters
that
were
very
far
from
arousing
his
rage
and
made
a
show
of
affability
where
he
was
most
vexed
he
would
pity
those
whom
he
severely
punished
and
retain
a
grudge
against
those
whom
he
pardoned
sometimes
he
would
regard
his
dearest
foe
as
his
nearest
friend
and
again
he
would
act
toward
his
most
intimate
companion
as
if
the
latter
were
thoroughly
hostile
in
general
he
thought
it
bad
policy
for
the
independent
sovereign
to
reveal
his
state
of
mind
this
was
the
source
he
said
of
great
failures
but
by
the
opposite
course
even
more
successes
and
greater
were
attained
if
he
had
merely
followed
this
method
without
complications
he
would
have
had
no
protection
against
such
as
had
come
to
know
him
they
would
have
taken
everything
by
contraries
and
would
have
deemed
his
saying
that
he
did
not
wish
something
to
be
equivalent
to
his
ardently
desiring
it
and
that
he
was
eager
for
something
equivalent
to
his
not
being
concerned
about
it
it
happened
however
that
he
became
angry
if
any
one
gave
evidence
of
understanding
him
many
were
those
he
put
to
death
for
no
other
offence
than
having
comprehended
him
it
was
a
dangerous
matter
then
to
fail
to
understand
him
for
many
were
ruined
by
approving
what
he
said
instead
of
what
he
wished
but
still
more
dangerous
to
understand
him
such
persons
were
suspected
of
discovering
his
practice
and
being
consequently
displeased
with
it
practically
the
only
sort
of
man
that
could
maintain
himself
and
such
a
person
is
rarely
found
was
one
who
did
not
misunderstand
his
nature
yet
did
not
subject
it
to
uncomfortable
exposure
under
these
conditions
men
would
not
be
deceived
by
believing
him
nor
be
hated
for
revealing
their
comprehension
of
his
policy
for
he
gave
plenty
of
trouble
both
to
any
one
who
opposed
what
he
said
and
to
any
one
who
favored
it
as
he
was
really
anxious
for
one
thing
to
be
done
but
wanted
to
appear
to
desire
something
different
he
invariably
regarded
those
who
took
either
side
as
his
opponents
and
therefore
was
hostile
to
the
one
class
because
of
his
real
feelings
and
to
the
other
for
the
sake
of
appearances
it
was
due
to
this
characteristic
that
as
emperor
he
sent
a
dispatch
straight
from
nola
to
the
legions
and
provinces
declaring
that
he
was
emperor
this
name
which
was
voted
him
along
with
the
rest
he
would
not
accept
and
though
taking
the
portion
of
augustus
he
would
not
adopt
this
title
of
his
at
a
time
when
he
was
already
surrounded
by
the
he
asked
the
senate
to
help
him
escape
suffering
any
violence
at
the
burial
of
the
emperor
body
he
was
afraid
some
men
might
snatch
it
up
and
burn
it
in
the
forum
as
they
had
that
of
cæsar
when
somebody
thereupon
as
a
compliment
voted
that
he
be
given
a
guard
as
if
he
had
none
he
saw
through
the
man
flattery
and
answered
the
soldiers
are
not
mine
but
the
public
besides
doing
this
he
administered
in
fact
all
the
business
of
the
empire
meanwhile
declaring
that
he
wanted
none
of
it
at
first
he
said
he
should
give
it
all
up
on
account
of
his
age
and
his
although
he
saw
extremely
well
in
the
dark
his
eyes
in
the
daylight
were
very
weak
later
he
asked
for
some
associates
and
colleagues
though
not
to
take
charge
of
the
whole
domain
at
once
as
in
an
oligarchy
but
he
divided
it
into
three
parts
one
of
which
he
should
retain
himself
and
yield
the
remaining
two
to
others
one
of
these
portions
consisted
of
rome
and
the
rest
of
italy
the
second
of
the
legions
the
third
of
the
subject
peoples
outside
though
he
became
very
urgent
most
of
the
senators
still
opposed
him
and
begged
him
to
govern
the
entire
realm
but
asinius
gallus
who
employed
the
frank
speech
of
old
days
more
than
was
good
for
him
replied
choose
whichever
part
you
wish
tiberius
rejoined
how
is
it
feasible
for
the
same
man
both
to
make
the
division
and
to
choose
gallus
perceiving
into
what
a
plight
he
had
fallen
framed
his
words
to
flatter
him
interrupting
to
the
effect
that
i
not
setting
before
you
the
idea
of
your
having
a
third
but
the
impossibility
of
the
being
divided
in
fact
however
he
did
not
mollify
tiberius
but
after
first
undergoing
many
dire
sufferings
was
subsequently
murdered
for
gallus
had
married
the
former
wife
of
the
new
ruler
and
claimed
drusus
as
his
son
and
consequently
there
had
been
hatred
between
them
before
this
tiberius
acted
in
this
way
at
that
time
chiefly
because
it
was
his
nature
and
he
had
determined
upon
that
policy
but
partly
also
because
he
was
suspicious
of
the
pannonian
and
germanic
legions
and
feared
germanicus
the
ruler
of
the
germany
of
that
day
and
a
favorite
of
theirs
he
had
previously
made
sure
of
the
soldiers
in
italy
by
means
of
the
oaths
established
by
augustus
but
as
he
was
suspicious
of
the
others
he
waited
for
either
possible
outcome
intending
to
save
himself
by
retiring
to
private
life
in
case
the
legions
should
revolt
and
prevail
for
this
reason
he
often
feigned
sickness
and
remained
at
home
so
as
not
to
be
compelled
to
say
or
do
anything
definite
i
have
even
heard
that
when
it
began
to
be
said
that
livia
against
the
will
of
augustus
had
kept
the
empire
for
him
he
took
such
action
that
he
might
appear
to
have
received
it
not
from
her
with
whom
he
was
on
very
bad
terms
but
under
compulsion
from
the
senators
through
surpassing
them
in
excellence
again
i
have
heard
that
when
he
saw
that
people
were
cool
toward
him
he
waited
and
delayed
in
order
that
they
in
the
hope
of
his
voluntarily
resigning
the
empire
might
no
adopt
rebellious
measures
until
he
had
secured
an
unshakable
control
of
the
government
still
i
do
not
record
these
stories
as
the
true
causes
of
his
delay
but
rather
his
usual
disposition
and
the
disturbance
among
the
soldiers
he
sent
some
one
from
nola
and
had
agrippa
killed
at
once
yet
he
declared
this
had
not
been
done
by
his
orders
and
he
threatened
the
perpetrator
of
the
deed
instead
of
punishing
him
however
he
allowed
men
to
invent
versions
of
the
affair
some
to
the
effect
that
augustus
had
put
him
out
of
the
way
just
before
his
death
others
that
the
centurion
who
was
guarding
him
slew
him
on
his
own
responsibility
for
some
revolutionary
dealings
others
that
livia
and
not
tiberius
had
ordered
his
death
this
rival
then
he
had
removed
from
the
scene
immediately
but
there
remained
germanicus
whom
he
feared
mightily
the
soldiers
in
pannonia
had
risen
as
soon
as
they
learned
of
the
demise
of
augustus
they
gathered
in
one
fort
and
having
strengthened
it
they
took
many
steps
toward
rebellion
among
other
things
they
attempted
to
kill
their
leader
junius
blæsus
and
arrested
and
tortured
his
slaves
in
general
what
they
wanted
was
to
have
the
period
of
service
extend
over
not
more
than
sixteen
years
and
they
demanded
that
they
should
receive
a
denarius
per
day
and
be
given
at
once
his
prizes
that
were
in
the
camp
in
case
they
did
not
obtain
their
demands
they
threatened
to
make
the
province
revolt
and
to
march
upon
rome
indeed
they
were
at
this
time
with
difficulty
won
over
by
the
persuasions
of
blæsus
to
send
envoys
to
tiberius
at
rome
in
regard
to
these
matters
for
they
hoped
during
this
change
in
the
government
to
accomplish
the
utmost
of
their
desires
either
by
frightening
the
emperor
into
it
or
by
giving
the
power
to
some
one
else
subsequently
when
drusus
came
upon
them
with
the
pretorians
they
were
thrown
into
tumult
once
more
because
no
definite
answer
was
returned
them
some
of
his
followers
they
wounded
and
they
put
a
guard
around
him
in
the
night
to
prevent
his
escape
noticing
however
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
occurring
they
felt
their
boldness
begin
to
waver
so
that
they
did
no
further
harm
to
this
detachment
and
despatched
envoys
again
to
tiberius
meantime
a
great
storm
came
up
and
when
on
this
account
every
one
had
retired
to
his
own
quarters
the
most
audacious
soldiers
were
destroyed
some
in
one
manner
some
in
another
by
drusus
and
his
associates
in
his
own
tent
whither
he
had
summoned
them
on
some
unsignifying
pretext
the
rest
were
restored
to
good
standing
on
condition
of
surrendering
for
punishment
those
responsible
for
the
uprising
in
this
way
this
division
became
quiet
the
warriors
in
germany
however
where
many
had
been
assembled
on
account
of
the
war
would
not
hear
of
moderation
since
they
saw
that
germanicus
was
both
a
cæsar
and
far
superior
to
tiberius
but
proclaiming
publicly
the
above
facts
they
heaped
abuse
upon
tiberius
and
saluted
germanicus
as
emperor
when
after
much
pleading
he
found
himself
unable
to
reduce
them
to
order
finally
he
drew
his
sword
as
if
to
despatch
himself
they
cried
out
upon
him
in
horror
and
one
of
them
proffering
his
own
sword
said
take
this
this
is
sharper
germanicus
seeing
to
what
lengths
the
matter
had
gone
did
not
venture
to
kill
himself
particularly
as
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
they
would
persist
in
their
uprising
none
the
less
therefore
he
composed
a
letter
purporting
to
have
been
sent
from
tiberius
gave
them
twice
the
gift
bequeathed
them
by
augustus
pretending
it
was
the
emperor
who
did
this
and
released
those
who
were
beyond
the
age
of
service
most
of
them
belonged
to
the
city
troops
which
augustus
had
gathered
as
an
extra
force
after
the
disaster
to
varus
as
a
result
they
ceased
for
the
time
being
their
seditious
behavior
later
on
came
senators
as
envoys
from
tiberius
to
whom
the
latter
had
secretly
communicated
only
so
much
as
he
wished
germanicus
to
know
he
felt
quite
sure
that
they
would
tell
him
the
emperor
plans
in
their
entirety
and
accordingly
did
not
care
that
either
they
or
germanicus
should
trouble
themselves
about
anything
further
the
instructions
delivered
were
supposed
to
comprise
everything
now
when
these
men
had
arrived
and
the
soldiers
learned
about
the
trick
germanicus
had
played
a
suspicion
sprang
up
that
the
presence
of
the
senators
meant
the
overthrow
of
their
leader
measures
and
this
led
to
new
turmoil
the
almost
killed
some
of
the
envoys
and
to
the
point
of
seizing
germanicus
wife
agrippina
daughter
of
agrippa
and
julia
the
daughter
of
augustus
and
his
son
both
of
whom
had
been
sent
by
him
to
some
place
for
refuge
the
boy
was
called
gaius
caligula
because
being
brought
up
for
the
most
part
in
the
camp
he
wore
the
military
shoes
instead
of
those
usual
at
the
capital
at
the
request
of
germanicus
they
released
to
him
agrippina
who
was
pregnant
but
they
retained
possession
of
gaius
yet
on
this
occasion
too
as
they
accomplished
nothing
they
after
a
time
grew
quiet
in
fact
they
experienced
such
a
revulsion
of
sentiment
that
of
their
own
accord
they
arrested
the
boldest
of
their
number
and
some
they
killed
privately
the
rest
they
brought
before
a
gathering
and
then
according
to
the
wish
of
the
majority
they
executed
some
and
released
others
germanicus
being
still
afraid
that
they
would
make
another
uprising
invaded
the
enemy
country
and
there
spent
some
time
giving
them
plenty
of
work
and
abundant
food
the
fruit
of
others
labor
thus
though
he
might
have
obtained
the
imperial
power
for
he
found
favor
in
the
sight
of
absolutely
all
the
romans
as
well
as
their
subjects
he
declined
the
honor
for
this
tiberius
praised
him
and
sent
many
pleasing
messages
both
to
him
and
to
agrippina
he
was
not
however
pleased
with
his
rival
progress
but
feared
him
all
the
more
because
he
had
won
the
attachment
of
the
legions
tiberius
assumed
that
he
did
not
feel
as
he
appeared
to
do
from
his
own
consciousness
of
saying
one
thing
and
doing
another
hence
he
was
suspicious
of
germanicus
and
further
suspicious
of
his
wife
who
was
possessed
of
an
ambition
appropriate
to
her
lofty
lineage
yet
he
displayed
no
sign
of
irritation
toward
them
but
delivered
many
eulogies
of
germanicus
in
the
senate
and
proposed
sacrifices
to
be
offered
in
honor
of
his
achievements
as
he
did
in
the
case
of
drusus
also
he
bestowed
upon
the
soldiers
in
pannonia
the
same
privileges
as
germanicus
had
given
for
the
future
however
he
refused
to
release
members
of
the
service
outside
of
italy
until
they
had
served
the
twenty
years
now
when
no
further
news
of
a
revolutionary
nature
came
but
all
parts
of
the
roman
world
began
to
yield
a
steady
acquiescence
to
his
leadership
he
no
longer
practiced
dissimulation
regarding
the
acceptance
of
sovereign
power
and
managed
the
empire
so
long
as
germanicus
lived
in
the
way
i
am
about
to
describe
he
did
little
or
nothing
that
is
on
his
own
responsibility
but
brought
even
the
smallest
matters
before
the
senate
and
communicated
them
to
that
body
in
the
forum
a
platform
had
been
erected
on
which
he
sat
in
public
to
transact
business
and
he
always
gathered
about
him
advisers
after
the
manner
of
augustus
moreover
he
did
not
take
any
step
of
consequence
without
making
it
known
to
the
rest
he
stated
his
own
opinion
openly
and
not
only
granted
every
one
the
right
to
oppose
it
freely
in
speech
but
sometimes
even
endured
to
have
some
vote
directly
against
it
often
he
would
cast
a
vote
himself
drusus
did
this
like
the
rest
now
voting
first
and
again
after
some
others
the
emperor
would
sometimes
remain
silent
and
sometimes
give
his
opinion
first
or
after
a
few
others
or
even
last
in
some
cases
he
would
speak
out
directly
but
generally
to
avoid
appearing
to
have
cut
short
their
freedom
of
speech
he
would
say
if
i
were
to
give
my
views
i
should
propose
this
or
that
this
had
equal
influence
with
the
other
method
only
those
who
came
after
were
not
prevented
by
him
from
stating
what
appeared
good
to
them
but
frequently
he
would
outline
one
plan
and
those
who
came
after
him
would
prefer
something
different
occasionally
they
even
prevailed
yet
for
all
that
he
harbored
anger
against
no
one
he
held
court
himself
as
i
have
stated
but
he
also
attended
the
magistrates
courts
both
when
summoned
by
them
and
without
an
invitation
these
officials
he
allowed
to
sit
in
their
own
places
he
himself
took
his
seat
on
the
bench
located
opposite
them
and
as
presiding
officer
made
any
remarks
that
seemed
to
him
pertinent
in
all
other
matters
too
he
behaved
in
this
same
way
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
called
master
by
the
freedmen
nor
imperator
except
by
the
soldiers
the
title
of
he
put
away
from
him
entirely
that
of
he
did
not
assume
for
he
never
permitted
the
question
to
be
put
to
vote
but
endured
to
hear
it
spoken
and
to
read
it
when
written
moreover
when
he
sent
messages
to
any
kings
he
would
regularly
include
this
title
in
his
letter
in
general
he
spoke
of
himself
as
cæsar
sometimes
as
germanicus
from
the
exploits
of
germanicus
and
according
to
ancient
usage
often
he
used
to
say
my
position
is
that
of
master
of
the
slaves
imperator
of
the
soldiers
and
first
citizen
among
the
rest
he
would
pray
whenever
it
happened
that
he
was
so
engaged
that
he
might
live
and
rule
so
long
a
time
as
should
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
public
and
he
was
so
democratic
in
all
circumstances
alike
that
on
his
birthday
he
did
not
permit
any
unusual
demonstrations
and
he
did
not
give
people
the
right
to
swear
by
his
fortune
nor
did
he
prosecute
any
one
who
after
swearing
by
it
incurred
the
charge
of
perjury
in
short
he
would
not
at
first
at
least
sanction
in
his
own
case
the
carrying
out
of
the
custom
which
has
obtained
as
a
matter
of
course
on
the
first
day
of
the
year
down
to
the
present
in
honor
of
augustus
of
all
rulers
that
came
after
him
of
whom
we
make
any
account
and
of
such
as
nowadays
succeed
to
imperial
privileges
namely
the
ratification
under
oath
of
what
they
have
done
and
of
what
they
shall
do
by
citizens
alive
during
the
particular
year
in
question
yet
in
the
case
of
the
measures
of
augustus
he
both
administered
the
oath
to
others
and
took
it
himself
in
order
to
render
his
attitude
more
striking
he
would
let
the
first
day
of
the
month
go
by
not
entering
the
senate
nor
showing
himself
at
all
in
the
city
on
that
day
but
spending
the
time
in
some
suburb
then
later
he
would
come
in
and
take
pledges
separately
this
was
part
of
the
reason
that
he
remained
somewhere
outside
on
the
first
days
of
the
month
but
he
was
also
anxious
to
avoid
disturbing
any
of
the
inhabitants
who
were
concerned
with
the
new
offices
and
the
festival
and
to
avoid
taking
money
from
them
he
did
not
even
commend
augustus
for
his
behavior
in
this
respect
because
it
brought
about
great
dissatisfaction
and
a
great
expenditure
in
order
to
return
favors
not
only
in
this
way
were
his
actions
democratic
but
no
precinct
was
set
apart
for
him
either
by
his
own
choice
or
in
any
other
way
that
is
to
say
at
this
time
nor
was
any
one
allowed
to
set
up
an
image
of
him
without
delay
he
expressly
forbade
any
city
or
individual
to
do
this
to
this
refusal
he
attached
the
phrase
unless
i
grant
permission
but
he
added
i
will
not
grant
it
least
of
all
did
he
assume
to
have
been
insulted
or
to
have
been
impiously
treated
by
any
one
men
were
already
calling
such
a
procedure
impiety
and
were
bringing
many
suits
based
on
that
ground
he
would
not
hear
of
any
such
indictment
being
brought
for
his
own
benefit
though
he
paid
tribute
to
the
majesty
of
augustus
in
this
matter
also
at
first
he
would
not
punish
even
such
as
had
incurred
charges
for
their
actions
in
regard
to
his
predecessor
and
some
against
whom
complaint
was
made
of
their
having
perjured
themselves
by
the
fortune
of
augustus
he
released
as
time
went
on
however
he
put
a
very
great
number
to
death
not
only
did
he
magnify
augustus
as
above
stated
but
in
giving
the
finishing
touches
to
the
buildings
of
which
augustus
had
laid
the
foundations
though
not
bringing
them
to
completion
he
inscribed
the
first
emperor
name
the
latter
statues
and
heroä
likewise
whether
those
that
the
provinces
or
those
that
individuals
were
erecting
he
partly
consecrated
himself
and
partly
assigned
to
some
member
of
the
pontifices
this
plan
of
inscribing
the
builder
name
he
carried
out
not
only
in
the
case
of
the
actual
monuments
of
augustus
himself
but
equally
in
the
case
of
all
such
as
needed
any
repair
he
put
in
good
condition
all
buildings
that
had
fallen
to
decay
not
constructing
anything
new
at
all
himself
except
the
temple
of
augustus
and
appropriated
none
of
them
but
restored
to
all
of
them
the
same
names
names
of
the
original
builders
while
expending
extremely
little
for
himself
he
laid
out
very
great
sums
for
the
common
good
either
building
over
or
adorning
practically
all
the
public
works
he
assisted
many
cities
and
individuals
and
enriched
numerous
senators
who
were
poor
and
on
that
account
were
no
longer
willing
to
be
members
of
the
senate
however
he
did
not
do
this
promiscuously
and
even
expunged
the
names
of
some
for
licentiousness
and
of
others
for
poverty
when
they
could
give
no
adequate
reason
for
it
every
gift
that
was
bestowed
upon
any
persons
was
counted
out
directly
in
his
presence
for
since
in
the
days
of
augustus
the
officials
who
made
the
presentation
were
wont
to
deduct
large
sums
for
their
own
use
he
took
the
greatest
care
that
this
should
not
happen
during
his
reign
all
the
expenditures
moreover
he
made
from
the
regular
sources
of
income
he
killed
no
one
for
his
money
did
not
confiscate
at
this
time
any
one
property
nor
collect
any
funds
by
abuses
indeed
when
aemilius
rectus
once
sent
him
from
egypt
of
which
he
was
governor
more
money
than
was
required
he
sent
him
a
message
saying
to
shear
my
sheep
and
not
to
shave
them
to
the
skin
is
what
i
desire
furthermore
he
was
extremely
easy
of
access
and
ready
to
grant
an
audience
the
senators
he
bade
greet
him
all
at
once
and
so
avoid
jostling
one
another
in
fine
he
showed
himself
so
considerate
that
once
when
the
leaders
of
the
rhodians
sent
him
some
communication
and
failed
to
write
at
the
foot
of
the
letter
this
customary
formula
about
offering
their
prayers
for
his
welfare
he
summoned
them
in
haste
as
if
he
intended
to
do
them
some
harm
but
on
their
arrival
instead
of
administering
any
serious
rebuke
had
them
subscribe
what
was
lacking
and
then
sent
them
away
the
temporary
officials
he
honored
as
he
would
have
done
in
a
democracy
even
rising
from
his
seat
at
the
approach
of
the
consuls
whenever
he
entertained
them
at
dinner
he
would
in
the
first
place
receive
them
at
the
door
when
they
entered
and
secondly
escort
them
on
their
way
when
they
departed
in
case
he
was
at
any
time
being
carried
anywhere
in
his
litter
he
would
not
allow
even
one
of
the
knights
who
was
prominent
to
accompany
him
still
less
a
senator
on
the
occasion
of
festivals
or
so
often
as
anything
similar
was
going
to
afford
the
people
leisure
he
would
go
the
evening
before
to
one
of
the
cæsarians
who
lived
near
the
places
where
there
was
sure
to
be
a
large
crowd
and
there
pass
the
night
his
object
was
to
make
it
possible
for
the
people
to
meet
him
with
a
minimum
of
formality
and
fatigue
the
equestrian
contests
he
would
often
watch
in
person
from
the
house
of
some
freedman
he
attended
the
spectacles
very
frequently
in
order
to
do
honor
to
those
who
gave
them
as
well
as
to
ensure
the
orderliness
of
the
multitude
and
to
seem
to
take
an
interest
in
their
celebration
really
he
did
not
care
in
the
least
about
anything
of
the
kind
nor
did
he
have
the
reputation
of
being
enthusiastic
in
these
matters
in
every
way
he
was
so
fair
and
equal
that
when
the
populace
once
desired
that
a
certain
dancer
be
set
free
he
would
not
approve
the
proposal
until
the
man
master
had
been
persuaded
and
received
the
value
of
his
chattel
his
intercourse
with
his
companions
was
like
that
between
private
individuals
he
helped
them
when
they
were
sued
and
joined
them
in
the
ceremony
of
sacrifice
he
visited
them
when
they
were
sick
taking
no
guard
into
the
room
with
him
over
one
of
them
who
died
he
himself
delivered
the
funeral
oration
moreover
he
bade
his
mother
behave
in
a
similar
manner
so
far
as
it
was
proper
for
her
to
do
so
partly
that
she
might
imitate
him
and
partly
to
prevent
her
becoming
overproud
she
occupied
a
position
of
great
prominence
far
above
all
women
of
former
time
so
that
she
could
at
any
time
receive
the
senate
and
such
of
the
people
as
so
wished
to
greet
her
in
her
house
this
was
also
inscribed
in
the
public
records
the
letters
of
tiberius
bore
for
a
time
her
name
also
and
were
written
by
both
with
equal
authority
except
that
she
never
ventured
to
enter
the
senate
or
the
camps
or
the
public
assemblies
she
undertook
to
man
age
everything
like
a
sole
ruler
in
the
time
of
augustus
she
had
had
great
influence
and
she
declared
that
it
was
she
who
made
tiberius
emperor
consequently
she
was
not
satisfied
to
rule
on
equal
terms
with
him
but
wished
to
assert
a
superiority
over
him
in
this
way
many
measures
out
of
the
ordinary
were
introduced
and
many
persons
voted
that
she
should
be
called
mother
of
her
country
many
others
that
she
should
he
termed
parent
others
proposed
that
tiberius
should
receive
his
name
from
her
that
just
as
the
greeks
were
called
by
their
father
name
so
he
should
be
called
by
his
mother
this
vexed
him
and
he
neither
ratified
the
honors
voted
her
save
a
very
few
nor
allowed
her
any
further
unusual
freedom
of
action
for
instance
she
had
once
dedicated
in
her
house
an
image
to
augustus
and
in
honor
of
the
event
wished
to
entertain
the
senate
and
the
knights
together
with
their
wives
but
he
would
not
grant
her
permission
to
carry
out
any
part
of
this
program
until
the
senate
had
voted
it
and
not
even
then
to
receive
the
men
at
dinner
instead
he
entertained
the
latter
and
she
attended
to
the
women
finally
he
removed
her
entirely
from
the
public
sphere
allowing
her
to
direct
affairs
within
doors
then
as
she
was
troublesome
even
in
this
capacity
he
proceeded
to
absent
himself
from
the
city
and
avoided
her
in
every
way
possible
it
was
chiefly
on
her
account
that
he
removed
to
this
is
the
tradition
that
obtains
about
livia
now
tiberius
began
to
treat
more
harshly
those
accused
of
any
crime
and
became
at
enmity
with
his
son
drusus
who
was
most
licentious
and
cruel
as
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
sharpest
kind
of
swords
was
called
drusian
after
him
him
he
often
censured
both
privately
and
publicly
once
he
said
to
him
outright
in
the
presence
of
many
witnesses
while
i
live
you
shall
perform
no
act
of
violence
or
insolence
and
if
you
venture
to
do
any
such
thing
you
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
possibility
after
i
am
dead
for
during
some
time
the
emperor
continued
to
live
a
very
temperate
life
and
allowed
no
one
else
to
indulge
in
licentiousness
but
punished
numbers
for
it
yet
once
when
the
senators
evinced
a
desire
to
have
a
penalty
imposed
by
law
upon
those
guilty
of
lewd
living
he
would
make
no
such
ruling
explaining
that
it
is
better
to
correct
them
privately
in
some
way
or
other
instead
of
laying
them
open
to
a
public
punishment
under
existing
conditions
he
said
there
was
a
chance
of
bringing
some
of
them
to
moderation
through
fear
of
disgrace
and
they
might
endeavor
to
escape
discovery
but
if
the
law
should
once
be
overcome
by
nature
no
one
would
pay
any
further
heed
to
it
not
a
few
men
also
were
wearing
quantities
of
purple
clothing
though
this
had
formerly
been
forbidden
of
these
no
one
was
either
rebuked
or
fined
but
when
a
rain
came
up
on
a
certain
festival
the
emperor
put
on
a
dark
woolen
cloak
after
this
none
of
them
dared
any
longer
to
assume
any
different
kind
of
garb
this
is
the
way
he
behaved
under
all
conditions
so
long
as
germanicus
lived
subsequent
to
that
event
he
changed
many
of
his
ways
perhaps
he
had
been
minded
from
the
first
as
he
later
appeared
to
feel
and
had
been
merely
shamming
as
long
as
germanicus
existed
because
he
saw
that
he
was
lying
in
wait
for
the
leadership
or
perhaps
he
was
excellent
by
nature
but
drifted
into
vice
when
he
was
deprived
of
his
rival
i
shall
notice
also
separate
events
all
those
at
least
that
deserve
mention
each
in
its
proper
place
in
the
consulship
of
drusus
his
son
and
of
gaius
norbanus
he
presented
to
the
people
the
bequests
made
by
augustus
this
was
after
some
one
had
approached
a
corpse
that
was
being
carried
out
through
the
forum
for
burial
and
bending
down
had
whispered
something
in
its
ear
when
the
spectators
asked
what
he
had
said
he
stated
that
he
had
commissioned
the
dead
to
tell
augustus
that
they
had
got
nothing
as
yet
this
man
the
emperor
immediately
despatched
in
order
as
he
jokingly
said
that
he
might
carry
his
own
message
to
augustus
with
the
rest
he
settled
after
a
little
distributing
denarii
apiece
some
say
this
payment
was
made
the
previous
year
at
this
time
certain
knights
desired
to
enter
a
championship
contest
in
the
games
which
drusus
had
arranged
for
his
own
celebration
and
that
of
germanicus
tiberius
did
not
view
their
combat
and
when
one
of
them
was
killed
he
forbade
the
other
to
fight
as
a
gladiator
again
still
other
conflicts
took
place
in
connection
with
the
that
was
in
honor
of
augustus
birthday
indeed
a
few
beasts
were
slain
so
things
went
on
for
a
number
of
years
at
this
time
too
crete
its
governor
being
dead
was
attached
to
the
quaestorship
and
to
the
quaestor
assistant
for
the
future
since
also
many
of
those
to
whom
the
provinces
had
been
allotted
lingered
in
rome
and
in
the
remainder
of
italy
for
a
long
time
so
that
those
who
had
held
the
office
before
them
delayed
contrary
to
precedent
tiberius
commanded
that
they
should
take
their
departure
by
the
first
day
of
june
meanwhile
his
grandson
by
drusus
died
but
he
neglected
none
of
his
customary
duties
it
was
his
settled
conviction
that
a
governor
of
men
ought
not
to
give
up
care
of
the
common
weal
by
reason
of
private
misfortunes
and
he
confirmed
the
rest
in
their
purpose
not
to
jeopardize
the
interests
of
the
living
because
of
the
dead
the
river
tiber
now
proceeded
to
occupy
a
large
portion
of
the
city
so
that
there
was
an
inundation
most
people
regarded
this
also
as
a
prodigy
like
the
great
earthquakes
which
shook
down
a
portion
of
the
wall
and
like
the
frequent
fall
of
thunderbolts
which
made
wine
leak
even
from
pails
that
were
sound
the
emperor
however
thinking
that
it
was
due
to
the
great
number
of
springs
appointed
five
senators
chosen
by
lot
to
constitute
a
permanent
board
to
look
after
the
river
to
the
end
that
it
should
not
give
out
in
summer
nor
become
over
full
in
winter
but
flow
evenly
so
far
as
possible
all
the
time
these
were
the
measures
of
tiberius
as
for
drusus
he
performed
the
duties
pertaining
to
the
consulship
along
with
his
colleague
as
any
private
citizen
might
have
done
being
left
heir
to
someone
estate
he
assisted
in
carrying
out
the
funeral
yet
he
was
so
prone
to
anger
that
he
inflicted
blows
upon
a
distinguished
knight
and
for
this
exploit
he
obtained
the
surname
of
castor
and
he
showed
himself
such
a
hard
drinker
that
one
night
when
he
was
forced
to
lend
aid
with
the
pretorians
to
some
people
whose
property
was
on
fire
he
commanded
at
their
request
for
water
to
pour
it
out
hot
for
them
he
was
so
fond
of
dancers
that
this
class
raised
a
tumult
and
would
not
be
brought
to
order
by
the
laws
which
tiberius
had
introduced
to
apply
to
them
these
were
the
events
of
that
period
now
when
statilius
taurus
was
consul
with
lucius
libo
tiberius
forbade
any
man
to
wear
silk
clothing
and
likewise
to
use
gold
ornaments
except
for
sacred
ceremonies
as
some
were
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
it
were
forbidden
them
also
to
possess
silver
ornaments
which
had
some
gold
inlaid
he
wished
to
issue
some
decree
about
this
too
but
he
refused
to
let
the
word
since
it
was
a
greek
term
be
inserted
in
the
original
document
yet
he
could
find
no
native
word
that
would
describe
such
inlaid
work
this
was
the
position
he
took
in
that
matter
now
there
was
a
centurion
who
wished
to
give
some
evidence
before
the
senate
in
greek
and
he
would
not
allow
it
yet
he
was
wont
to
hear
many
suits
that
were
argued
there
in
that
language
and
to
investigate
many
himself
besides
his
unusual
behavior
in
this
respect
he
failed
to
pass
sentence
on
lucius
scribonius
libo
a
young
noble
suspected
of
revolutionary
designs
so
long
as
the
latter
was
well
but
upon
his
falling
sick
he
had
him
brought
into
the
senate
in
a
covered
litter
such
as
the
wives
of
senators
use
to
be
condemned
to
death
a
slight
delay
ensued
and
libo
committed
suicide
whereupon
the
emperor
passed
judgment
upon
his
behavior
though
he
was
dead
gave
his
money
to
the
accusers
and
had
sacrifices
voted
for
his
overthrow
not
only
for
his
own
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
augustus
and
of
the
latter
father
julius
as
had
occasionally
been
decreed
in
past
times
though
he
took
such
action
in
the
case
of
this
man
he
administered
no
rebuke
at
all
to
vibius
rufus
who
used
cæsar
chair
the
one
on
which
the
latter
was
always
accustomed
to
sit
and
on
which
he
was
slain
rufus
did
this
regularly
besides
having
cicero
wife
as
his
consort
and
prided
himself
on
both
achievements
evidently
thinking
that
he
would
become
an
orator
by
means
of
the
wife
or
a
cæsar
by
means
of
the
chair
for
this
as
i
have
stated
he
received
no
censure
indeed
he
became
consul
tiberius
was
moreover
forever
in
the
company
of
thrasyllus
and
made
some
use
of
the
mantic
art
every
day
becoming
himself
so
proficient
in
the
study
that
when
he
was
once
bidden
in
a
dream
to
give
money
to
a
certain
person
he
comprehended
that
a
deceitful
spirit
had
been
called
up
before
him
and
he
put
the
man
to
death
likewise
in
the
case
of
all
the
rest
of
the
astrologers
and
magicians
and
those
who
practiced
divination
in
any
other
way
whatever
he
had
the
foreigners
executed
and
banished
all
such
citizens
as
still
at
that
time
after
the
previous
decree
by
which
it
had
been
forbidden
to
engage
in
any
such
business
in
the
city
were
accused
in
court
of
employing
the
art
to
such
of
them
as
obeyed
immunity
had
been
granted
in
fact
all
the
citizens
would
have
been
acquitted
even
contrary
to
his
wish
had
not
a
certain
tribune
prevented
it
here
one
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
democratic
constitution
inasmuch
as
the
senate
approving
the
course
of
gnaeus
calpurnius
piso
overcame
drusus
and
tiberius
and
was
itself
subdued
by
the
tribune
these
affairs
were
settled
in
this
way
certain
men
who
had
been
quaestors
the
previous
year
were
sent
out
to
the
provinces
since
those
who
were
quaestors
at
the
time
proved
too
few
for
them
this
was
done
again
and
again
as
often
as
it
was
found
necessary
many
of
the
public
documents
had
either
perished
utterly
or
had
faded
during
the
lapse
of
time
three
senators
were
therefore
elected
to
copy
off
what
was
extant
and
to
look
up
the
assistance
was
given
in
several
conflagrations
not
only
by
tiberius
but
also
by
livia
the
same
year
a
certain
clemens
who
had
been
a
slave
of
agrippa
and
resembled
him
to
a
certain
extent
pretended
to
be
he
he
went
to
gaul
and
won
the
attachment
of
many
there
and
later
of
many
in
italy
finally
he
marched
upon
rome
with
the
avowed
intention
of
recovering
the
dominion
of
his
grandfather
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
were
thrown
into
confusion
at
this
and
not
a
few
joined
his
cause
tiberius
however
got
him
in
his
hands
by
a
clever
device
and
through
the
agency
of
certain
persons
who
pretended
to
sympathize
with
the
upstart
then
he
tortured
the
prisoner
in
order
to
learn
something
about
his
fellow
conspirators
but
when
the
victim
uttered
not
a
word
the
emperor
asked
him
how
did
you
get
to
be
agrippa
and
he
replied
in
the
same
way
as
you
got
to
be
cæsar
u
the
following
year
gaius
cæcilius
and
lucius
flaccus
received
the
title
of
consuls
and
when
some
brought
tiberius
money
after
the
first
of
the
month
he
would
not
accept
it
and
published
a
kind
of
document
regarding
this
very
point
in
which
he
used
a
word
that
was
not
latin
after
thinking
it
over
by
night
he
sent
for
all
those
who
had
accurate
knowledge
of
such
matters
for
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
have
his
diction
irreproachable
thereupon
a
certain
ateius
capito
declared
even
if
no
one
has
previously
used
this
expression
yet
because
of
you
we
shall
all
enumerate
it
among
the
primitive
usages
but
was
interrupted
by
one
marcellus
who
said
you
being
cæsar
can
extend
roman
government
over
men
but
not
over
words
and
the
emperor
did
the
man
no
harm
for
this
in
spite
of
the
excessive
frankness
of
his
speech
he
had
a
grudge
however
against
archelaus
the
king
of
cappadocia
because
the
latter
had
first
become
his
suppliant
to
the
extent
of
employing
him
as
advocate
when
this
monarch
in
the
time
of
augustus
had
been
accused
by
his
people
and
had
subsequently
slighted
him
on
the
occasion
of
a
visit
to
rhodes
but
had
paid
court
to
gaius
who
also
went
to
asia
therefore
he
summoned
him
on
the
charge
of
rebellious
behavior
and
delivered
him
up
to
the
votes
of
the
senate
the
king
was
not
only
well
stricken
in
years
but
a
great
sufferer
from
gout
and
was
moreover
believed
to
be
demented
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
been
incommoded
previously
by
loss
of
mind
to
the
extent
of
having
a
guardian
placed
over
his
domain
by
augustus
but
at
that
time
he
was
no
longer
and
was
merely
feigning
in
the
hope
of
saving
himself
by
this
expedient
if
by
no
other
he
would
now
have
been
executed
had
not
some
one
in
testifying
against
him
stated
that
he
had
once
said
when
i
get
back
home
i
will
show
him
what
sort
of
sinews
i
possess
a
shout
of
laughter
went
up
at
this
for
the
man
was
not
only
unable
to
stand
but
could
not
even
assume
a
sitting
posture
and
so
tiberius
gave
up
his
plan
of
putting
him
to
death
the
condition
of
the
prince
was
so
serious
that
he
was
carried
into
the
senate
in
a
covered
litter
for
since
it
was
customary
even
for
men
whenever
one
of
them
came
there
feeling
ill
to
be
carried
in
a
reclining
position
tiberius
took
advantage
of
the
method
on
this
occasion
too
and
the
invalid
spoke
a
few
words
bending
forward
from
the
litter
so
it
was
that
the
life
of
archelaus
was
temporarily
saved
but
he
died
shortly
afterward
in
some
other
way
after
this
cappadocia
reverted
to
the
romans
and
was
put
in
charge
of
a
knight
to
the
cities
in
asia
which
had
been
damaged
by
the
earthquake
an
was
assigned
with
five
lictors
considerable
money
therefore
was
diverted
from
the
revenues
and
considerable
was
given
by
tiberius
personally
for
whereas
he
refrained
scrupulously
from
the
possessions
of
others
so
long
at
least
as
he
practiced
virtue
at
all
and
would
not
even
accept
the
inheritances
which
were
left
to
him
by
testators
having
relatives
he
spent
vast
sums
both
upon
the
cities
and
upon
private
individuals
he
would
not
hear
of
any
honor
or
praise
for
these
embassies
that
came
from
foreign
cities
or
nations
he
never
dealt
with
alone
but
caused
a
number
of
others
to
participate
in
the
deliberations
and
especially
such
as
had
once
governed
these
peoples
now
germanicus
having
acquired
a
reputation
for
his
campaign
against
the
celtae
advanced
as
far
as
the
ocean
inflicted
an
overwhelming
defeat
upon
the
barbarians
collected
and
buried
the
bones
of
those
who
had
fallen
under
varus
and
won
back
the
military
standards
his
wife
julia
was
not
recalled
from
the
banishment
to
which
for
unchastity
her
father
augustus
had
condemned
her
nay
he
even
put
her
under
lock
and
key
till
wretchedness
and
starvation
caused
her
death
or
the
senate
urged
upon
tiberius
the
request
that
the
month
of
november
on
the
sixteenth
of
which
he
had
been
born
should
be
called
tiberius
to
which
he
responded
what
will
you
do
if
there
arise
thirteen
cæsars
later
when
marcus
junius
and
lucius
norbanus
came
to
office
a
portent
of
some
magnitude
occurred
on
the
very
first
day
of
the
month
and
it
doubtless
had
a
bearing
on
the
fate
of
germanicus
norbanus
the
consul
had
always
been
devoted
to
the
trumpet
and
as
he
had
practiced
assiduously
in
this
pursuit
he
wished
on
this
occasion
also
to
play
the
instrument
just
about
dawn
when
many
persons
were
already
near
his
house
this
proceeding
threw
them
all
without
exception
into
confusion
just
as
if
the
consul
had
imparted
to
them
some
warlike
signal
and
they
were
also
disturbed
by
the
falling
of
the
statue
of
janus
their
calm
was
further
ruffled
by
an
oracle
reputed
to
be
a
sibylline
utterance
which
would
not
fit
any
other
period
of
the
city
history
but
pointed
to
that
very
time
it
declared
after
thrice
three
hundred
revolving
years
have
been
numbered
civil
strife
shall
consume
the
romans
and
the
sybaritan
folly
tiberius
denounced
these
verses
as
false
and
made
an
investigation
of
all
the
books
containing
any
prophecies
some
he
rejected
as
worthless
and
others
he
admitted
as
genuine
as
there
had
been
a
large
influx
of
jews
into
rome
and
they
were
converting
many
of
the
native
inhabitants
to
their
principles
he
expelled
the
great
majority
of
them
at
the
death
of
germanicus
tiberius
and
livia
were
thoroughly
pleased
but
everybody
else
was
mightily
afflicted
he
was
a
man
who
possessed
the
most
striking
physical
beauty
and
likewise
the
noblest
of
spirits
both
in
education
and
in
strength
he
was
conspicuous
and
whereas
he
was
the
bravest
of
the
brave
against
the
enemy
he
was
the
mildest
of
the
mild
to
his
friend
though
as
a
cæsar
he
had
extreme
power
he
kept
his
ambitions
on
the
same
plane
as
weaker
men
he
in
no
wise
conducted
himself
oppressively
toward
his
subjects
or
with
jealousy
toward
drusus
or
in
any
way
to
deserve
censure
toward
tiberius
in
brief
he
belonged
to
the
few
men
of
all
time
who
have
neither
sinned
against
the
fortune
allotted
to
them
nor
been
destroyed
by
it
although
on
several
occasions
he
might
with
the
free
consent
not
only
of
the
soldiers
but
of
the
people
and
senate
as
well
have
obtained
the
imperial
power
he
refused
to
do
so
his
death
occurred
in
antioch
as
the
result
of
a
plot
formed
by
piso
and
plancina
bones
of
men
buried
in
the
house
where
he
dwelt
and
sheets
of
lead
containing
certain
curses
along
with
his
name
were
found
while
he
yet
breathed
piso
was
brought
before
the
senate
by
tiberius
himself
on
the
charge
of
having
murdered
germanicus
but
succeeded
in
securing
a
postponement
and
committed
suicide
germanicus
left
three
sons
whom
augustus
in
his
testament
denominated
cæsars
the
eldest
of
these
nero
at
that
time
had
his
name
placed
among
the
number
of
the
iuvenes
tiberius
who
had
hitherto
been
the
author
of
manifold
meritorious
works
and
had
made
but
few
errors
now
when
he
ceased
to
have
a
rival
in
view
changed
to
precisely
the
reverse
of
his
previous
conduct
which
had
included
many
excellent
deeds
among
other
ways
in
which
his
rule
became
cruel
he
pushed
to
the
bitter
end
the
trials
for
maiestas
in
cases
where
complaint
was
made
against
any
one
for
committing
any
improper
act
or
uttering
any
improper
speech
not
only
against
augustus
but
against
tiberius
personally
and
against
his
mother
and
towards
those
suspected
of
plotting
against
him
he
was
inexorable
tiberius
was
stern
in
his
chastisement
of
persons
accused
of
an
offence
he
would
remark
as
follows
nobody
willingly
submits
to
be
ruled
but
a
man
is
driven
into
it
reluctantly
not
only
do
subjects
like
to
refuse
obedience
but
more
than
that
they
enjoy
plotting
against
their
rulers
and
he
would
accept
accusers
indiscriminately
a
slave
might
denounce
a
master
or
a
son
a
father
indeed
by
indicating
to
certain
persons
his
wish
for
the
death
of
certain
others
he
brought
about
the
destruction
of
the
latter
through
the
medium
of
the
former
and
there
was
no
secrecy
about
these
transactions
not
only
were
slaves
tortured
to
make
them
testify
against
their
own
masters
but
freedmen
and
citizens
as
well
such
as
accused
or
offered
testimony
against
persons
divided
by
lot
the
property
of
those
convicted
and
received
in
addition
both
offices
and
honors
in
the
case
of
many
he
took
care
to
ascertain
the
day
and
the
hour
that
they
had
been
born
and
on
the
basis
of
their
character
and
fortune
thus
investigated
would
put
them
to
death
if
he
discovered
any
qualities
of
haughtiness
and
aspiration
to
power
in
any
one
he
despatched
him
whether
or
no
yet
so
much
did
he
investigate
and
understand
what
was
fated
for
each
of
the
prominent
men
that
on
meeting
galba
subsequently
emperor
when
the
latter
had
betrothed
a
wife
he
remarked
you
also
shall
taste
of
the
sovereignty
he
spared
him
as
i
conjecture
because
this
was
settled
as
his
fate
but
as
he
explained
it
himself
because
galba
would
reign
only
in
old
age
and
long
after
his
death
tiberius
also
found
some
pretexts
for
assassinations
the
death
of
germanicus
led
to
the
destruction
of
many
others
on
the
ground
that
they
were
pleased
at
it
the
man
who
coöperated
with
him
and
helped
him
in
all
his
undertakings
with
the
utmost
zeal
was
lucius
aelius
sejanus
a
son
of
strabo
and
formerly
a
favorite
of
marcus
gabius
apicius
that
apicius
who
so
surpassed
all
mankind
in
voluptuous
living
that
when
he
had
once
desired
to
learn
how
much
he
had
already
spent
and
how
much
he
still
had
on
finding
that
two
hundred
and
fifty
myriads
were
left
him
became
feeling
that
he
was
destined
to
die
of
hunger
and
took
his
own
life
this
sejanus
accordingly
at
one
time
shared
his
command
of
the
pretorians
after
his
father
had
been
sent
to
egypt
and
he
obtained
entire
control
he
made
the
force
more
compact
in
many
ways
gathering
within
one
fortification
the
cohorts
which
had
been
separate
and
apart
from
one
another
like
those
of
the
night
guardsmen
in
this
way
the
entire
body
could
receive
the
orders
speedily
and
they
were
a
source
of
terror
to
all
because
they
were
within
one
fortification
this
was
the
man
whom
tiberius
because
of
the
similarity
of
their
characters
took
as
his
helper
elevating
him
to
prætorial
honors
which
had
never
yet
been
accorded
to
any
of
his
peers
and
he
made
him
his
adviser
and
assistant
in
all
matters
in
fine
he
changed
so
much
after
the
death
of
germanicus
that
whereas
previously
he
was
highly
praised
he
now
attracted
even
greater
wonder
u
when
tiberius
began
to
hold
the
consular
office
in
company
with
drusus
men
immediately
began
to
prophecy
destruction
for
drusus
from
this
very
circumstance
for
there
is
not
a
man
who
was
ever
consul
with
tiberius
that
did
not
meet
a
violent
death
but
in
the
first
place
there
was
quintilius
varus
and
next
gnæus
piso
and
then
germanicus
himself
who
perished
violently
and
miserably
the
emperor
was
evidently
doomed
to
cause
such
ruin
throughout
his
life
drusus
his
colleague
at
this
time
and
sejanus
who
subsequently
participated
in
the
office
also
came
to
grief
while
tiberius
was
out
of
town
gaius
lutorius
priscus
a
knight
who
took
great
pride
in
his
poetic
talents
and
had
composed
a
notable
funeral
oration
over
germanicus
for
which
he
had
received
considerable
money
was
charged
with
having
composed
a
poem
upon
drusus
also
during
the
illness
for
this
he
was
tried
in
the
senate
condemned
and
put
to
death
now
tiberius
was
vexed
not
because
the
man
had
been
punished
but
because
the
senators
had
inflicted
death
upon
any
one
without
his
approval
he
therefore
rebuked
them
and
ordered
a
decree
to
be
issued
to
the
effect
that
no
person
condemned
by
them
be
executed
within
ten
days
nor
the
document
applying
to
his
case
be
made
public
before
the
same
time
this
was
to
ensure
the
possibility
of
his
learning
their
decrees
in
advance
even
while
absent
and
of
rendering
a
final
decision
on
such
matters
after
this
when
his
consulship
had
expired
he
came
to
rome
and
prevented
the
consuls
from
acting
as
advocates
to
certain
persons
by
saying
if
i
were
consul
i
should
not
do
this
one
of
the
prætors
was
accused
of
having
uttered
some
impious
word
or
having
committed
some
impious
act
against
him
whereupon
the
man
left
the
senate
and
taking
off
his
robe
of
office
returned
demanding
as
a
private
citizen
to
have
the
complaint
lodged
at
once
at
this
the
emperor
showed
great
grief
and
molested
him
no
further
the
dancers
he
drove
out
of
rome
and
would
allow
them
no
place
in
which
to
practice
their
profession
because
they
kept
debauching
the
women
and
stirring
up
tumults
he
honored
many
men
and
numbers
of
those
who
died
with
statues
and
public
funerals
a
bronze
statue
of
sejanus
was
erected
in
the
theatre
during
the
life
of
the
model
as
a
result
numerous
images
of
this
minister
were
made
by
many
persons
and
many
encomiuma
were
spoken
both
in
the
assembly
and
in
the
senate
the
consuls
themselves
besides
the
other
prominent
citizens
regularly
had
recourse
to
his
house
just
at
dawn
and
communicated
to
him
both
all
the
private
requests
that
any
of
them
wished
to
make
of
tiberius
and
the
public
business
which
had
to
be
taken
up
in
brief
henceforth
nothing
of
the
kind
was
considered
without
his
knowledge
about
this
time
one
of
the
largest
porticos
in
rome
began
to
lean
to
one
side
and
was
set
upright
in
a
remarkable
way
by
a
certain
architect
whose
name
no
one
knows
because
tiberius
jealous
of
his
wonderful
achievement
would
not
permit
it
to
be
entered
in
the
records
this
architect
accordingly
however
he
was
called
after
strengthening
the
foundations
all
about
so
that
they
could
not
move
out
of
position
and
surrounding
all
the
rest
of
the
arcade
with
thick
fleeces
and
cloths
ran
ropes
all
over
it
and
through
it
and
by
the
pushing
of
many
men
and
machines
brought
it
once
more
into
its
previous
position
at
the
time
tiberius
both
admired
him
and
felt
envious
of
him
for
the
former
reason
he
honored
him
with
a
present
of
money
and
for
the
latter
he
expelled
him
from
the
city
later
the
exile
approached
him
to
make
supplication
during
the
course
of
which
he
purposely
let
fall
a
crystal
goblet
which
fell
apart
somehow
or
was
broken
and
then
by
passing
his
hands
over
it
showed
it
straightway
intact
for
this
the
suppliant
hoped
to
have
obtained
pardon
but
instead
the
emperor
put
him
to
death
drusus
son
of
tiberius
perished
by
poison
sejanus
puffed
up
by
power
and
rank
in
addition
to
his
other
overweening
behavior
finally
turned
against
drusus
and
once
struck
him
a
blow
with
his
fist
as
this
gave
the
assailant
reason
to
fear
both
drusus
and
tiberius
and
inasmuch
as
he
felt
sure
that
if
he
could
get
the
young
man
out
of
the
way
he
could
handle
the
elder
very
easily
he
administered
poison
to
the
former
through
the
agency
of
those
in
attendance
upon
him
and
of
drusus
wife
whom
some
name
livilla
sejanus
was
her
the
guilt
was
imputed
to
tiberius
because
he
altered
none
of
his
accustomed
habits
either
during
the
illness
of
drusus
or
at
his
death
and
would
not
allow
others
to
alter
theirs
but
the
story
is
not
credible
this
was
his
regular
behavior
as
a
matter
of
principle
in
every
case
alike
and
furthermore
he
was
attached
to
his
son
the
only
one
he
had
and
legitimate
those
that
engineered
his
death
he
punished
some
at
once
and
some
later
at
the
time
he
entered
the
senate
delivered
the
appropriate
eulogy
over
his
child
and
departed
homeward
thus
perished
sejanus
victim
tiberius
took
his
way
to
the
where
he
lamented
him
publicly
put
nero
and
drusus
children
of
germanicus
in
charge
of
the
senate
and
exposed
the
body
of
drusus
upon
the
rostra
and
nero
being
his
pronounced
an
eulogy
over
him
this
man
death
proved
a
cause
of
death
to
many
persons
who
were
taxed
with
being
pleased
at
his
demise
among
the
large
number
of
people
who
lost
their
lives
was
agrippina
together
with
her
children
the
youngest
excepted
sejanus
had
incensed
tiberius
greatly
against
her
anticipating
that
when
she
and
her
children
were
disposed
of
he
might
have
for
his
spouse
livia
wife
of
drusus
for
whom
he
entertained
a
passion
and
might
wield
supreme
power
since
no
successor
would
be
found
for
tiberius
the
latter
detested
his
nephew
as
a
bastard
many
others
also
did
he
banish
or
destroy
for
different
and
ever
different
causes
for
the
most
part
fictitious
tiberius
forbade
those
debarred
from
fire
and
water
to
make
any
will
a
custom
still
observed
ælius
saturninus
he
brought
before
the
senate
for
trial
on
the
charge
of
having
recited
some
improper
verses
about
him
and
the
culprit
having
been
found
guilty
was
hurled
from
the
capitol
i
might
narrate
many
other
such
occurrences
if
i
were
to
go
into
all
in
detail
but
the
general
statement
may
suffice
that
many
were
slain
by
him
for
such
offences
and
also
this
that
he
investigated
carefully
case
by
case
all
the
slighting
remarks
that
any
persons
were
accused
of
uttering
against
him
and
then
called
himself
all
the
ill
names
that
other
men
invented
even
if
a
person
made
some
statement
secretly
and
to
a
single
companion
he
would
publish
this
too
and
actually
had
it
entered
on
the
official
records
often
he
falsely
added
from
his
own
consciousness
of
defects
what
no
one
had
even
said
as
really
spoken
in
order
that
it
might
be
thought
he
had
juster
cause
for
his
wrath
consequently
it
came
to
pass
that
he
himself
committed
against
himself
all
those
outrages
for
which
he
was
wont
to
chastise
other
people
on
the
ground
of
impiety
and
he
likewise
became
subject
to
no
little
ridicule
for
if
persons
denied
having
spoken
certain
phrases
he
by
asserting
and
taking
oath
that
it
had
been
said
wronged
himself
with
greater
show
of
reality
for
this
reason
some
suspected
that
he
was
bereft
of
his
senses
yet
he
was
not
generally
believed
to
be
insane
simply
for
this
behavior
all
other
business
he
managed
in
a
way
quite
beyond
criticism
for
instance
he
appointed
a
guardian
over
a
certain
senator
that
lived
licentiously
as
he
might
have
done
for
a
child
again
he
brought
capito
procurator
of
asia
before
the
senate
and
after
charging
him
with
using
soldiers
and
acting
in
some
other
ways
as
if
he
had
supreme
command
he
banished
him
in
those
days
officials
administering
the
imperial
funds
were
allowed
to
do
nothing
more
than
to
levy
the
customary
tribute
and
they
were
compelled
in
the
case
of
disputes
to
stand
trial
in
the
forum
and
according
to
the
laws
on
an
equal
footing
with
private
so
great
were
the
contrasts
in
tiberius
conduct
when
the
ten
years
of
his
office
had
expired
he
did
not
ask
any
vote
for
its
resumption
for
he
had
no
wish
to
receive
it
piecemeal
as
augustus
had
done
the
decennial
festival
however
was
held
cremutius
cordus
was
forced
to
lay
violent
hands
upon
himself
because
he
had
come
into
collision
with
sejanus
he
was
at
the
gates
of
old
age
and
had
lived
most
irreproachably
so
much
so
that
no
sufficient
complaint
could
be
found
against
him
and
he
was
tried
for
the
history
which
he
had
long
before
composed
regarding
the
deeds
of
augustus
and
the
latter
himself
had
read
the
ground
of
censure
was
that
he
had
praised
cassius
and
brutus
and
had
attacked
the
people
and
the
senate
of
cæsar
and
augustus
he
had
spoken
no
ill
but
at
the
same
time
had
shown
no
excessive
respect
for
them
this
was
the
complaint
against
him
and
this
it
was
that
caused
his
death
as
well
as
the
burning
of
his
works
those
found
in
the
city
at
this
time
being
destroyed
by
the
ædiles
and
those
abroad
by
the
officials
of
each
place
later
they
were
published
again
for
his
daughter
marcia
in
particular
as
well
as
others
had
hidden
copies
and
they
attracted
much
greater
attention
by
reason
of
the
unhappy
end
of
cordus
about
this
time
tiberius
exhibited
to
the
senators
his
pretorian
cohort
in
the
act
of
exercising
as
if
they
were
ignorant
of
his
power
his
purpose
was
to
make
them
more
afraid
of
him
when
they
saw
his
defenders
so
many
and
so
strong
besides
these
events
of
the
time
that
seem
worthy
to
chronicle
in
a
history
the
people
of
cyzicus
were
once
more
deprived
of
their
freedom
because
they
had
imprisoned
certain
romans
and
because
they
had
not
completed
the
heroüm
to
augustus
that
they
had
begun
to
and
the
emperor
would
certainly
have
put
to
death
the
man
who
sold
the
statue
along
with
his
house
and
was
brought
to
trial
for
the
act
had
not
the
consul
asked
the
ruler
himself
to
give
his
vote
first
being
ashamed
to
appear
partial
to
himself
he
cast
his
ballot
for
acquittal
also
a
senator
lentulus
an
excellent
man
naturally
and
now
far
advanced
in
old
age
was
accused
by
some
one
of
having
plotted
against
the
emperor
lentulus
was
present
and
burst
out
laughing
at
this
an
uproar
arose
in
the
senate
which
was
calmed
by
tiberius
saying
i
am
no
longer
worthy
to
live
if
lentulus
too
hates
me

he
went
away
about
this
time
from
rome
and
never
returned
to
the
city
at
all
though
he
was
ever
on
the
point
of
doing
so
and
kept
sending
messages
to
that
effect
much
calamity
could
be
laid
by
the
romans
at
his
door
since
he
wasted
the
lives
of
men
alike
for
public
service
and
for
private
whim
as
when
he
decided
to
expel
the
hunting
spectacles
from
the
city
consequently
some
persons
attempted
to
carry
them
on
in
the
country
outside
and
perished
in
the
ruins
of
their
theatres
which
had
been
loosely
constructed
of
rude
planks
it
was
now
too
that
a
certain
latiarius
a
companion
of
sabinus
one
of
the
most
prominent
men
at
rome
and
also
in
favor
with
sejanus
concealed
senators
in
the
ceiling
of
the
apartment
where
his
friend
lived
and
led
sabinus
into
conversation
by
throwing
out
some
of
his
usual
remarks
he
induced
the
other
also
to
speak
out
freely
all
that
he
had
in
his
mind
it
is
the
practice
of
such
as
wish
to
play
the
sycophant
to
take
the
lead
in
some
kind
of
abuse
and
to
disclose
some
secret
intending
that
their
victim
either
for
listening
to
them
or
for
saying
something
similar
may
find
himself
liable
to
indictment
to
the
sycophants
since
they
do
it
with
a
purpose
freedom
of
speech
involves
no
danger
they
are
regarded
as
speaking
so
not
because
their
words
express
their
real
sentiments
but
because
they
wish
to
convict
others
their
victims
however
are
punished
for
the
smallest
syllable
out
of
the
ordinary
that
they
may
utter
this
also
happened
in
the
present
case
sabinus
was
put
in
prison
that
very
day
and
subsequently
perished
without
trial
his
body
was
flung
down
the
scalæ
gemoniæ
and
cast
into
the
river
the
affair
was
made
more
tragic
by
the
behavior
of
a
dog
of
sabinus
that
went
with
him
to
his
cell
was
by
him
at
his
death
and
at
the
end
was
thrown
into
the
river
with
such
was
the
nature
of
this
event
sidenote
during
this
same
period
livia
also
passed
away
at
the
age
of
tiberius
paid
her
no
visits
while
she
was
ill
and
did
not
personally
attend
to
her
laying
out
in
fact
he
made
no
arrangements
at
all
in
her
honor
save
the
public
funeral
and
images
and
some
other
small
matters
of
no
importance
as
for
her
being
deified
he
forbade
that
absolutely
the
senate
however
did
not
content
itself
with
voting
merely
the
measures
which
he
had
ordained
but
enjoined
upon
the
women
mourning
for
her
during
the
entire
year
although
it
approved
the
course
of
tiberius
in
not
abandoning
even
at
this
time
the
conduct
of
public
business
furthermore
they
voted
her
an
arch
as
had
never
been
done
in
the
case
of
any
other
woman
because
she
had
preserved
not
a
few
of
them
had
reared
many
children
belonging
to
citizens
and
had
helped
find
husbands
for
numerous
girls
for
all
of
which
acts
some
called
her
mother
of
her
country
she
was
buried
in
the
mausoleum
of
augustus
tiberius
would
not
pay
a
single
one
of
her
bequests
to
anybody
among
the
many
excellent
utterances
of
hers
that
are
related
is
one
concerned
with
the
occasion
when
some
men
that
were
naked
met
her
and
on
that
account
fell
under
sentence
of
execution
she
saved
their
lives
by
saying
that
to
chaste
women
such
persons
were
no
whit
different
from
statues
when
some
one
asked
her
how
and
by
what
course
of
action
she
had
obtained
such
an
influence
over
augustus
she
answered
that
it
was
by
being
scrupulously
chaste
herself
doing
willingly
whatever
pleased
him
not
meddling
with
any
of
his
business
and
particularly
by
pretending
neither
to
hear
of
nor
notice
the
favorites
that
were
the
objects
of
his
passion
such
was
the
character
of
livia
the
arch
voted
to
her
however
was
not
built
for
the
reason
that
tiberius
promised
to
construct
it
at
his
own
expense
for
as
he
disliked
to
annul
the
decree
by
direct
command
he
made
it
void
in
this
way
by
not
allowing
the
work
to
be
undertaken
out
of
the
public
funds
nor
attending
to
it
himself
or
sejanus
was
rising
to
still
greater
heights
it
was
voted
that
his
birthday
should
be
publicly
observed
and
the
mass
of
statues
which
the
senate
and
the
equestrian
order
the
tribes
and
the
foremost
citizens
set
up
would
have
passed
any
one
power
to
count
separate
envoys
were
sent
to
both
these
rulers
by
the
senate
as
well
as
the
knights
and
also
by
the
people
who
selected
them
from
their
own
tribunes
and
aediles
for
both
of
them
alike
they
offered
prayers
and
sacrifices
and
they
took
oaths
by
their
fortunes
u
gallus
who
married
the
wife
of
tiberius
and
spoke
his
mind
regarding
the
empire
was
the
next
object
of
the
emperor
attack
for
which
the
right
moment
had
been
carefully
selected
whether
he
really
believed
that
sejanus
would
be
emperor
or
whether
it
was
out
of
fear
of
tiberius
he
paid
court
to
the
former
it
may
indeed
have
been
a
kind
of
plot
to
make
the
minister
irksome
to
tiberius
and
so
accomplish
his
ruin
but
at
any
rate
gallus
transacted
the
greater
and
more
important
part
of
his
business
with
him
and
made
efforts
to
be
one
of
the
envoys
therefore
the
emperor
sent
a
report
about
him
to
the
senate
making
among
other
statements
one
to
the
effect
that
this
man
was
jealous
of
his
friendship
for
sejanus
although
gallus
himself
treated
syriacus
as
an
intimate
friend
he
did
not
make
this
known
to
gallus
entertaining
him
most
hospitably
instead
hence
something
most
unusual
befell
him
that
never
happened
to
any
one
else
on
the
very
same
day
he
was
banqueted
at
the
house
of
tiberius
pledging
him
in
the
cup
of
friendship
and
was
condemned
before
the
senate
indeed
a
prætor
was
sent
to
imprison
him
and
lead
him
away
for
punishment
yet
tiberius
though
he
had
acted
so
did
not
permit
his
victim
to
die
in
spite
of
the
latter
wish
for
death
as
soon
as
he
learned
the
decree
instead
he
bade
gallus
in
order
to
make
his
lot
still
more
dismal
to
be
of
good
cheer
and
instructed
the
senate
that
he
should
be
guarded
without
bonds
until
the
emperor
should
reach
the
city
his
object
as
i
said
was
to
make
the
prisoner
suffer
for
the
longest
possible
time
both
from
deprivation
of
his
civic
rights
and
from
terror
so
it
turned
out
he
was
kept
under
the
eyes
of
the
consuls
of
each
year
except
when
tiberius
held
the
office
in
that
case
he
was
guarded
by
the
prætors
not
to
prevent
his
escape
but
to
prevent
his
death
he
had
no
companion
or
servant
as
associate
spoke
to
no
one
saw
no
one
except
when
he
was
compelled
to
take
food
and
what
he
got
was
of
such
a
quality
and
amount
as
neither
to
afford
him
any
pleasure
or
strength
nor
yet
to
allow
him
to
die
this
was
the
worst
feature
of
it
tiberius
did
the
same
thing
in
the
case
of
many
others
for
instance
he
had
imprisoned
one
of
his
companions
and
when
there
was
later
talk
about
executing
him
he
said
i
have
not
yet
made
my
peace
with
him
some
one
else
again
he
had
tortured
very
severely
and
then
on
ascertaining
that
the
victim
had
been
unjustly
accused
he
had
him
killed
with
all
speed
remarking
that
he
had
been
too
terribly
outraged
to
find
any
satisfaction
in
living
syriacus
who
had
neither
committed
nor
been
charged
with
any
wrong
but
was
renowned
for
his
education
was
slain
merely
for
the
reason
that
tiberius
said
he
was
a
friend
of
gallus
sejanus
brought
false
accusation
also
against
drusus
through
the
medium
of
his
wife
for
by
maintaining
illicit
relations
with
practically
all
the
wives
of
the
distinguished
men
he
learned
what
their
husbands
said
and
did
and
further
made
them
his
assistants
by
promises
of
marriage
now
when
tiberius
without
discussion
sent
drusus
to
rome
sejanus
fearing
that
his
position
might
be
injured
persuaded
cassius
to
busy
himself
against
him
after
exalting
sejanus
to
a
high
pinnacle
of
glory
and
making
him
a
member
of
his
family
by
the
alliance
with
julia
daughter
of
drusus
tiberius
later
killed
him
now
sejanus
was
growing
greater
and
more
formidable
all
the
time
and
his
progress
made
the
senators
and
the
rest
look
up
to
him
as
if
he
were
actually
emperor
and
esteem
tiberius
lightly
when
tiberius
learned
this
he
did
not
regard
the
matter
as
a
trivial
one
fearing
indeed
that
they
would
hail
his
rival
as
emperor
outright
and
he
did
not
neglect
it
yet
he
did
nothing
openly
for
sejanus
had
won
the
entire
pretorian
guard
thoroughly
to
his
own
side
and
had
gained
the
favor
of
the
senators
partly
by
benefits
partly
by
implanting
hopes
and
partly
by
intimidation
he
had
made
all
the
attendants
on
tiberius
so
entirely
his
friends
that
absolutely
everything
the
emperor
did
was
at
once
reported
to
him
whereas
of
what
he
did
not
a
word
reached
ears
hence
the
latter
appeared
content
to
follow
where
sejanus
led
appointed
him
consul
and
termed
him
sharer
of
his
cares
repeating
often
the
phrase
my
sejanus
and
publishing
the
same
by
writing
it
to
the
senate
and
the
people
men
took
this
behavior
as
sincere
and
were
deceived
and
so
set
up
bronze
statues
all
about
to
both
alike
wrote
their
names
together
in
bulletins
and
brought
into
the
theatres
gilded
chairs
for
both
finally
it
was
voted
that
they
should
together
be
made
consuls
every
four
years
and
that
a
body
of
citizens
should
go
out
to
meet
both
alike
whenever
they
entered
rome
in
the
end
they
sacrificed
to
the
images
of
sejanus
as
to
those
of
tiberius
this
was
the
way
matters
stood
with
sejanus
now
among
the
rest
many
famous
men
met
an
ill
fate
of
whom
was
also
gaius
fufius
geminus
being
accused
of
the
crime
of
maiestas
against
tiberius
he
took
his
will
into
the
and
read
it
showing
that
he
had
left
his
inheritance
in
equal
portions
to
his
children
and
to
his
sovereign
as
he
was
charged
with
weakness
he
went
home
before
any
vote
was
reached
when
he
learned
that
the
quæstor
had
arrived
to
attend
to
his
execution
he
wounded
himself
and
displaying
the
wound
to
the
official
exclaimed
report
to
the
senate
that
it
is
thus
one
dies
who
is
a
man
likewise
his
wife
mutilia
prisca
against
whom
some
complaint
was
made
made
her
way
into
the
senate
and
there
stabbed
herself
with
a
dagger
which
she
had
brought
in
secretly
next
he
destroyed
mutilia
and
her
husband
together
with
two
daughters
on
account
of
her
friendship
for
his
mother
in
the
days
of
tiberius
all
who
accused
any
persons
regularly
received
money
and
large
allotments
both
from
the
victims
property
and
from
the
public
treasury
in
addition
to
various
honors
there
were
cases
where
certain
men
who
impudently
threw
others
into
a
panic
or
recklessly
passed
the
death
sentence
upon
them
obtained
in
the
one
instance
statues
and
in
the
other
triumphal
honors
hence
several
citizens
who
were
really
illustrious
and
conquered
the
right
to
some
such
distinction
would
not
assume
it
out
of
reluctance
to
let
any
period
of
their
lives
betray
even
a
superficial
similarity
to
the
careers
of
those
scoundrels
tiberius
feigning
sickness
sent
sejanus
on
to
rome
with
the
assurance
that
he
should
follow
he
declared
that
in
this
separation
a
part
of
his
own
body
and
soul
was
wrenched
away
from
him
shedding
tears
he
embraced
and
kissed
him
and
sejanus
naturally
was
thereat
the
more
elated
a
u
by
this
time
sejanus
was
so
imposing
both
in
his
haughtiness
of
mind
and
in
his
immensity
of
power
that
to
make
a
long
matter
short
he
seemed
to
be
the
emperor
and
tiberius
a
kind
of
island
potentate
because
the
latter
spent
all
his
days
in
the
island
called
capreæ
then
there
was
rivalry
and
jostling
about
the
great
man
doors
from
the
fear
not
merely
that
a
person
might
fail
to
be
observed
by
his
patron
but
that
he
might
appear
among
the
last
for
all
the
words
and
gestures
particularly
of
those
in
front
were
carefully
watched
people
who
hold
a
prominent
position
as
the
result
of
native
worth
are
not
given
at
all
to
seeking
signs
of
friendship
from
others
and
in
case
anything
of
the
sort
is
seen
to
be
wanting
on
the
part
of
these
others
the
persons
in
question
are
not
provoked
inasmuch
as
they
have
an
innate
consciousness
that
they
are
not
being
looked
down
upon
any
however
that
hold
an
artificial
rank
are
extremely
jealous
of
all
such
attentions
feeling
them
to
be
necessary
to
render
their
position
complete
if
they
fail
to
obtain
them
then
they
are
as
irritated
as
if
slander
were
being
pronounced
against
them
and
as
angry
as
if
they
were
the
recipients
of
positive
insult
consequently
the
world
is
more
scrupulous
in
the
case
of
such
persons
than
one
might
almost
say
in
the
case
of
emperors
themselves
to
the
latter
it
is
ascribed
as
a
virtue
to
pardon
any
one
if
an
error
is
committed
but
in
the
persons
that
course
appears
to
argue
an
inherent
weakness
whereas
to
attack
and
to
exact
vengeance
is
thought
to
furnish
proof
of
great
power
one
morning
the
first
of
the
month
when
all
were
gathered
at
house
the
couch
placed
in
the
small
room
where
he
received
broke
into
infinitesimal
fragments
under
the
weight
of
the
throng
seated
upon
it
and
as
he
was
leaving
the
house
a
weasel
darted
through
the
midst
of
them
after
he
had
sacrificed
on
the
capitol
and
was
now
coming
down
to
the
forum
his
servants
that
acted
as
turned
aside
along
the
road
leading
to
the
prison
because
the
crowd
prevented
them
from
escorting
him
and
as
they
descended
the
steps
down
which
condemned
criminals
were
commonly
cast
they
slipped
and
fell
subsequently
he
took
the
auspices
and
not
one
bird
of
good
omen
appeared
but
crows
flew
and
cawed
about
him
and
then
flew
off
all
together
to
the
jail
where
they
alighted
these
prodigies
neither
sejanus
nor
any
one
else
laid
to
heart
for
in
view
of
the
way
things
stood
not
even
if
some
god
had
plainly
foretold
that
so
great
a
change
would
take
place
in
a
short
time
would
any
one
have
believed
it
they
swore
by
his
fortune
as
if
they
would
never
be
weary
and
hailed
him
colleague
of
tiberius
making
this
phrase
refer
not
to
the
consulship
but
to
the
supreme
power
tiberius
was
no
longer
uninformed
of
aught
that
concerned
his
minister
he
racked
his
brains
to
see
in
what
manner
he
might
kill
him
but
not
finding
any
way
in
which
he
might
do
this
openly
and
safely
he
treated
both
the
man
himself
and
all
the
rest
in
a
remarkable
fashion
so
as
to
gain
an
accurate
knowledge
of
their
feeling
he
sent
many
despatches
of
all
kinds
regarding
himself
to
sejanus
and
to
the
senate
incessantly
saying
at
one
time
that
he
was
poorly
and
just
at
the
point
of
death
and
again
that
he
was
in
exceedingly
good
health
and
would
reach
rome
directly
now
he
would
strongly
approve
sejanus
and
again
vehemently
denounce
him
some
of
his
companions
he
would
honor
to
show
his
regard
for
him
and
others
he
would
dishonor
thus
sejanus
filled
in
turn
with
extreme
elation
and
extreme
fear
was
always
in
a
flutter
he
could
not
decide
to
be
terrified
and
for
that
reason
attempt
a
revolution
inasmuch
as
he
was
being
honored
nor
yet
to
become
bold
enough
to
attempt
some
desperate
venture
inasmuch
as
he
was
frequently
abased
moreover
all
the
rest
of
the
people
were
getting
to
feel
dubious
because
they
heard
alternately
and
at
short
intervals
the
most
contrary
reports
because
they
could
no
longer
justify
themselves
in
either
admiring
or
despising
sejanus
and
because
they
were
wondering
about
tiberius
thinking
first
that
he
was
going
to
die
and
then
that
his
arrival
was
imminent
sejanus
was
disturbed
by
all
this
and
a
great
deal
more
by
the
fact
that
from
one
of
his
statues
at
first
a
mass
of
smoke
ascended
in
a
burst
and
then
when
the
head
was
taken
off
to
enable
investigators
to
see
what
was
going
on
a
huge
serpent
darted
up
another
head
at
once
replaced
the
former
and
accordingly
he
was
on
the
point
of
sacrificing
to
himself
for
sacrificing
to
himself
was
a
regular
part
of
his
program
when
a
rope
was
discovered
coiled
around
the
statue
neck
also
a
figure
of
fortuna
made
as
is
said
in
the
time
of
tullius
an
early
king
of
rome
one
which
sejanus
at
this
time
kept
at
his
house
and
took
great
pride
in
he
saw
turn
away
while
he
was
sacrificing
in
person
and
later
others
who
had
gone
out
in
their
company
most
men
were
suspicious
of
these
circumstances
but
since
they
did
not
know
the
mind
of
tiberius
and
further
took
into
consideration
the
caprice
and
the
unstable
condition
of
affairs
they
were
divided
in
sentiment
privately
they
kept
a
sharp
eye
on
their
own
safety
but
publicly
they
paid
court
to
him
among
other
reasons
because
tiberius
had
joined
to
him
as
priests
both
sejanus
and
his
son
moreover
they
had
given
him
the
proconsular
authority
and
had
likewise
voted
that
word
be
sent
to
all
such
as
were
consuls
from
year
to
year
to
emulate
him
in
their
office
so
tiberius
had
honored
him
with
the
priesthoods
but
he
did
not
send
for
him
instead
when
his
minister
requested
that
he
might
go
to
campania
pleading
as
an
excuse
that
his
fiancée
was
ill
the
emperor
directed
him
to
stay
where
he
was
giving
as
a
reason
that
he
would
himself
arrive
in
rome
in
almost
no
time
as
a
result
then
of
this
sejanus
was
again
gradually
alienated
and
his
vexation
was
increased
by
the
fact
that
tiberius
appointed
gaius
priest
with
the
imperial
commendation
and
gave
some
hints
to
the
effect
that
he
should
make
the
new
appointee
his
successor
in
the
empire
the
angry
favorite
would
have
begun
rebellious
measures
especially
as
the
soldiers
were
ready
to
obey
him
in
everything
had
he
not
perceived
that
the
populace
was
hugely
pleased
at
what
was
said
in
regard
to
gaius
out
of
reverence
for
the
memory
of
germanicus
his
father
sejanus
had
previously
thought
that
these
persons
too
were
on
his
side
and
now
finding
them
enthusiastic
for
gaius
he
became
dejected
he
felt
sorry
that
he
had
not
shown
open
revolt
during
his
consulship
the
rest
were
strongly
influenced
against
him
by
the
course
of
events
as
also
by
tiberius
action
in
releasing
soon
after
an
enemy
of
sejanus
chosen
ten
years
before
to
govern
spain
and
just
now
being
tried
on
certain
charges
because
of
sejanus
the
emperor
also
granted
temporary
immunity
from
such
suits
to
such
others
as
were
going
to
govern
any
provinces
or
to
administer
any
similar
public
business
and
in
writing
to
the
senate
about
the
death
of
nero
he
used
simply
the
name
sejanus
with
no
phrases
added
as
had
been
his
custom
moreover
he
forbade
offering
sacrifice
to
any
human
being
because
sacrifice
was
often
offered
to
this
man
and
the
introduction
of
any
business
looking
to
his
own
honor
because
many
honorary
measures
were
being
passed
for
his
rival
benefit
he
had
forbidden
this
practice
still
earlier
but
now
on
account
of
sejanus
he
renewed
his
injunction
for
naturally
if
he
allowed
nothing
of
the
sort
to
be
done
in
his
own
case
he
would
not
permit
it
in
the
case
of
another
in
view
of
all
this
the
people
began
to
look
down
on
sejanus
more
and
more
to
the
point
of
drawing
aside
at
his
approach
and
leaving
him
alone
and
that
openly
without
pretence
of
concealment
when
tiberius
learned
of
it
his
courage
revived
he
felt
that
he
should
have
the
coöperation
of
the
people
and
the
senate
and
accordingly
began
an
attack
upon
his
enemy
first
in
order
to
take
him
off
his
guard
to
the
fullest
possible
extent
be
spread
a
report
that
he
would
give
him
the
office
of
tribune
then
he
despatched
a
communication
against
him
to
the
senate
by
the
hands
of
nævius
sertorius
macro
whom
he
had
privately
appointed
to
command
the
and
had
instructed
as
to
precisely
what
must
be
done
the
latter
came
by
night
into
rome
as
if
on
some
different
errand
and
made
known
his
message
to
memmius
regulus
then
consul
his
colleague
sided
with
sejanus
and
to
græcinius
laco
commander
of
the
night
watch
at
dawn
macro
ascended
the
palatine
where
there
was
to
be
a
session
of
the
senate
in
the
temple
of
apollo
encountering
sejanus
who
had
not
yet
gone
in
he
saw
that
he
was
troubled
at
tiberius
having
sent
him
no
message
and
encouraged
him
telling
him
aside
and
in
confidence
that
he
was
bringing
him
the
tribunician
authority
sejanus
overjoyed
at
this
hastened
to
the
macro
sent
away
to
the
camp
the
pretorians
that
commonly
surrounded
the
minister
and
the
senate
after
revealing
to
them
his
right
as
leader
to
do
so
and
declaring
that
he
brought
documents
from
tiberius
that
bestowed
gifts
upon
them
around
the
temple
he
stationed
the
night
watch
in
their
stead
went
in
himself
delivered
his
letter
to
the
consuls
and
went
out
before
a
word
was
read
he
then
put
laco
in
charge
of
guard
duty
at
that
point
and
himself
hurried
to
the
camp
to
prevent
any
uprising
meanwhile
the
letter
was
read
it
was
a
long
one
and
contained
no
wholesale
denunciations
of
sejanus
but
first
some
indifferent
matters
then
a
slight
censure
of
his
conduct
then
something
else
and
after
that
some
further
objection
to
him
at
the
close
it
said
that
two
senators
that
were
very
intimate
with
him
must
be
punished
and
that
he
himself
must
be
kept
guarded
tiberius
did
not
give
them
orders
outright
to
put
him
to
death
not
because
such
was
not
his
desire
but
because
he
feared
that
some
disturbance
might
be
the
result
of
it
but
since
as
he
said
he
could
not
take
the
journey
safely
he
had
sent
for
one
of
the
consuls
this
was
all
that
the
composition
disclosed
during
the
reading
many
diverse
utterances
and
expressions
of
countenance
were
observable
first
before
the
people
heard
the
letter
they
were
engaged
in
lauding
the
man
whom
they
supposed
to
be
on
the
point
of
receiving
the
tribunician
authority
they
shouted
their
approval
realizing
in
anticipation
all
their
hopes
and
making
a
demonstration
to
show
that
they
would
concur
in
granting
him
honor
when
however
nothing
of
the
sort
was
discovered
but
they
kept
hearing
just
the
reverse
of
what
they
expected
they
fell
into
confusion
and
subsequently
into
deep
dejection
some
of
those
seated
near
him
even
withdrew
they
now
no
longer
cared
to
share
the
same
seat
with
the
man
whom
previously
they
were
anxious
to
claim
as
friend
then
prætors
and
tribunes
began
to
surround
him
to
prevent
his
causing
any
uproar
by
rushing
out
which
he
certainly
would
have
done
if
he
had
been
startled
at
the
outset
by
any
general
tirade
as
it
was
he
paid
no
great
heed
to
what
was
read
from
time
to
time
thinking
it
a
slight
matter
a
single
charge
and
hoping
that
nothing
further
or
at
any
rate
nothing
serious
in
regard
to
him
had
been
made
a
matter
of
comment
so
he
let
the
time
slip
by
and
remained
where
he
was
meantime
regulus
called
him
forward
but
he
paid
no
attention
not
out
of
contempt
for
he
had
already
been
humbled
but
because
he
was
unaccustomed
to
hearing
any
command
given
him
but
when
the
consul
shouted
at
him
a
second
and
a
third
time
at
the
same
time
stretching
out
his
arm
and
saying
sejanus
come
here
he
enquired
blankly
are
you
calling
so
at
last
he
stood
up
and
laco
who
had
entered
took
his
stand
beside
him
when
finally
the
reading
of
the
letter
was
finished
all
with
one
voice
both
denounced
him
and
uttered
threats
some
because
they
had
been
wronged
others
through
fear
some
to
disguise
their
friendship
for
him
and
others
out
of
joy
at
his
downfall
regulus
did
not
give
all
of
them
however
a
chance
to
vote
nor
did
he
put
the
question
to
any
one
regarding
the
man
death
for
fear
there
should
be
come
opposition
and
a
consequent
disturbance
for
sejanus
had
numerous
relatives
and
friends
hence
after
asking
one
person
opinion
and
obtaining
a
supporting
vote
in
favor
of
imprisonment
he
conducted
the
former
favorite
out
of
the
and
in
company
with
the
other
officials
and
with
laco
led
him
down
to
the
prison
then
might
one
have
obtained
a
clear
and
searching
insight
into
the
weakness
of
man
so
that
would
have
been
never
again
under
any
conditions
possible
him
whom
at
dawn
they
had
escorted
to
the
as
one
superior
to
themselves
they
were
now
dragging
to
a
cell
as
if
no
better
than
the
worst
on
him
whom
they
once
deemed
worthy
of
crowns
they
now
heaped
bonds
him
whom
they
were
wont
to
protect
as
a
master
they
now
guarded
like
a
runaway
slave
and
uncovered
while
he
wore
a
headdress
him
whom
they
had
adorned
with
the
toga
they
struck
in
the
face
whom
they
were
wont
to
adore
and
sacrifice
to
as
to
a
god
they
were
now
leading
to
execution
the
crowd
also
assailed
him
reproaching
him
violently
for
the
lives
he
had
destroyed
and
jeering
loudly
at
what
had
been
hoped
of
him
all
of
his
images
they
hurled
down
beat
down
and
pulled
down
seeming
to
feel
that
they
were
maltreating
the
man
himself
and
he
thus
became
a
spectator
of
what
he
was
destined
to
suffer
for
the
moment
he
was
merely
cast
into
prison
but
not
much
later
that
very
day
in
fact
the
senate
assembled
in
the
temple
of
concord
not
far
from
his
cell
and
seeing
the
attitude
of
the
populace
and
that
none
of
the
pretorians
was
near
by
it
condemned
him
to
death
on
these
orders
he
was
executed
and
his
body
cast
down
the
scalæ
gemoniæ
where
the
rabble
abused
it
for
three
whole
days
and
afterward
threw
it
into
the
river
his
children
were
put
to
death
by
special
decree
the
girl
whom
he
had
betrothed
to
the
son
of
claudius
having
been
first
outraged
by
the
public
executioner
on
the
principle
that
it
was
unlawful
for
a
virgin
to
meet
death
in
prison
his
wife
apicata
was
not
condemned
to
be
sure
but
on
learning
that
her
children
were
dead
and
after
seeing
their
bodies
on
the
stairs
she
withdrew
and
composed
a
statement
regarding
the
death
of
drusus
directed
against
livilla
the
latter
wife
who
had
been
the
cause
of
a
quarrel
between
herself
and
her
husband
resulting
in
their
separation
this
document
she
forwarded
to
tiberius
and
then
committed
suicide
thus
the
statement
came
to
the
hands
of
tiberius
and
when
he
had
obtained
proof
of
the
information
he
put
to
death
livilla
and
all
others
therein
mentioned
i
have
indeed
heard
that
he
spared
her
out
of
regard
for
her
mother
antonia
and
that
antonia
herself
voluntarily
destroyed
her
daughter
by
starving
her
at
any
rate
that
was
later
at
this
time
a
great
uproar
ensued
in
the
city
the
populace
slew
any
one
it
saw
of
those
who
had
possessed
great
influence
with
sejanus
and
relying
on
him
had
committed
acts
of
insolence
the
soldiers
too
in
irritation
because
they
had
been
suspected
of
friendliness
toward
sejanus
and
because
the
nightwatchmen
had
been
preferred
before
them
in
the
confidence
of
the
emperor
proceeded
to
burn
and
plunder
and
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
all
officials
were
guarding
the
entire
city
in
accordance
with
the
injunction
of
tiberius
not
even
the
senate
was
quiet
but
such
members
of
it
as
had
paid
court
to
sejanus
were
greatly
disturbed
by
dread
of
reprisals
and
those
who
had
accused
or
borne
witness
against
any
persons
were
filled
with
fear
by
the
prevailing
suspicion
that
they
had
destroyed
their
victims
out
of
regard
for
the
minister
instead
of
for
tiberius
very
small
indeed
was
the
courageous
element
which
was
unhampered
by
these
terrors
and
expected
that
tiberius
would
become
milder
for
as
usually
happens
they
laid
the
responsibility
for
their
previous
misfortunes
upon
the
dead
man
and
charged
the
emperor
with
few
or
none
of
them
of
the
most
of
this
unjust
treatment
they
said
he
had
been
ignorant
and
he
had
been
forced
into
the
rest
against
his
will
privately
this
was
the
disposition
of
the
various
classes
publicly
they
voted
as
if
they
had
cast
off
some
tyranny
not
to
hold
any
mourning
over
the
deceased
and
to
have
a
statue
of
liberty
erected
in
the
forum
also
a
festival
was
to
be
celebrated
under
the
auspices
of
all
the
magistrates
and
priests
as
had
never
before
occurred
and
the
day
on
which
he
died
was
to
be
made
renowned
by
annual
and
slaughters
of
wild
beasts
directed
by
those
appointed
to
the
four
priesthoods
and
by
the
members
of
the
sodality
of
augustus
this
too
had
never
before
been
done
to
celebrate
the
ruin
of
the
man
whom
they
by
the
excess
and
novelty
of
their
honors
had
led
to
destruction
they
voted
solemnities
that
were
not
customary
even
for
the
gods
they
comprehended
so
clearly
that
it
was
chiefly
these
honors
which
had
bereft
him
of
his
senses
that
they
at
once
forbade
explicitly
the
giving
of
excessive
marks
of
esteem
to
any
one
as
also
the
taking
of
oaths
in
the
name
of
any
one
other
than
the
emperor
yet
though
they
passed
such
votes
as
if
under
a
divine
inspiration
they
began
shortly
after
to
fawn
upon
macro
and
laco
they
gave
them
great
sums
of
money
and
to
laco
the
honors
of
while
to
macro
they
extended
the
honors
of
similarly
they
allowed
them
also
to
view
spectacles
in
their
company
and
to
wear
the
toga
praetextata
at
the
ludi
votivi
the
men
did
not
accept
these
privileges
however
for
the
recent
example
served
as
a
deterrent
nor
would
tiberius
take
any
honor
bestowed
though
many
were
voted
him
chief
among
them
being
that
he
should
begin
from
this
time
to
be
termed
father
of
his
country
and
that
his
birthday
should
be
marked
by
ten
equestrian
contests
and
a
senatorial
banquet
indeed
he
gave
notice
anew
that
no
one
should
introduce
any
such
these
were
the
events
happening
in
the
capital
tiberius
for
a
time
had
certainly
been
in
great
fear
that
sejanus
would
occupy
the
city
and
sail
against
him
and
so
he
had
prepared
boats
to
the
end
that
if
anything
of
the
sort
should
come
to
pass
he
might
escape
he
had
commanded
macro
or
so
some
say
if
there
should
be
any
uprising
to
bring
drusus
before
the
senate
and
the
people
and
appoint
him
emperor
when
he
learned
that
his
enemy
was
dead
he
rejoiced
as
was
natural
yet
would
not
receive
the
embassy
sent
to
congratulate
him
though
many
members
of
the
senate
and
many
of
the
knights
and
of
the
populace
had
been
despatched
as
before
indeed
he
even
rebuffed
the
consul
regulus
who
had
always
been
devoted
to
his
interests
and
had
come
in
accordance
with
the
emperor
own
commands
to
see
about
his
being
conveyed
in
safety
to
the
city
thus
perished
sejanus
who
had
attained
greater
power
than
those
who
obtained
his
office
before
or
after
him
save
plautianus
his
relatives
his
associates
and
all
the
rest
who
had
paid
court
to
him
and
had
moved
that
honors
be
granted
him
were
brought
to
trial
the
majority
of
them
were
convicted
for
the
acts
that
had
previously
made
them
objects
of
envy
and
their
condemned
them
for
the
measures
which
they
themselves
had
previously
voted
numbers
of
men
who
had
been
tried
on
various
charges
and
acquitted
were
again
accused
and
convicted
on
the
ground
that
they
had
been
saved
the
first
time
as
a
favor
to
the
deceased
accordingly
if
no
other
complaint
could
be
brought
against
a
person
the
statement
that
he
had
been
a
friend
of
sejanus
served
to
convict
him
as
if
forsooth
tiberius
himself
had
not
been
friendly
with
him
and
caused
others
to
become
interested
for
his
sake
among
those
who
laid
information
in
this
way
were
the
men
who
were
wont
to
pay
court
to
sejanus
inasmuch
as
they
knew
thoroughly
those
who
were
in
the
same
position
they
had
no
great
trouble
either
in
finding
them
out
or
securing
their
conviction
so
they
expecting
to
save
themselves
by
doing
this
and
to
obtain
honors
and
money
besides
accused
others
or
else
bore
witness
against
them
but
it
proved
that
none
of
their
hopes
was
realized
they
found
themselves
liable
to
the
same
charges
on
which
they
had
prosecuted
others
and
partly
as
a
result
of
them
and
partly
on
account
of
the
general
detestation
of
traitors
perished
along
with
their
companions
of
those
against
whom
charges
were
brought
many
were
present
in
person
to
hear
their
accusation
and
make
their
defence
and
some
employed
great
frankness
in
so
doing
still
the
majority
made
away
with
themselves
prior
to
their
conviction
they
did
this
chiefly
to
avoid
suffering
insult
and
outrage
for
all
who
had
incurred
any
such
charge
senators
as
well
as
knights
women
as
well
as
men
were
crowded
together
into
the
prison
after
their
condemnation
some
underwent
the
penalty
there
and
others
were
hurled
from
the
capitol
by
the
tribunes
or
the
consuls
the
bodies
of
all
of
them
were
cast
into
the
forum
and
subsequently
were
thrown
into
the
river
but
their
object
was
partly
that
their
children
might
inherit
their
property
very
few
estates
of
such
as
voluntarily
took
themselves
off
before
their
trial
were
confiscated
tiberius
in
this
way
inviting
men
to
become
their
own
murderers
that
he
might
avoid
the
reputation
of
having
killed
them
as
if
it
were
not
far
more
fearful
to
compel
a
man
to
die
by
his
own
hand
than
to
deliver
him
to
the
executioner
most
of
the
estates
of
such
as
failed
to
die
in
this
way
were
confiscated
only
a
little
or
nothing
at
all
even
being
given
to
their
accusers
for
he
was
now
giving
far
more
accurate
attention
to
money
after
this
tiberius
increased
to
one
per
cent
a
tax
which
was
already
of
one
per
cent
and
proceeded
to
accept
every
inheritance
left
to
him
and
in
fact
nearly
every
one
left
him
something
even
those
who
made
away
with
themselves
as
they
had
to
sejanus
while
the
latter
lived
also
with
that
same
intention
which
had
led
him
not
to
take
possession
of
the
wealth
of
those
who
perished
voluntarily
he
made
the
senate
sponsor
for
every
official
summons
to
the
end
that
he
might
be
free
from
blame
himself
for
so
he
thought
and
the
senate
pass
sentence
upon
itself
as
a
wrongdoer
by
this
means
people
came
to
be
thoroughly
aware
during
the
time
that
they
were
being
destroyed
through
one
another
agency
that
their
former
troubles
had
emanated
no
more
from
sejanus
than
from
tiberius
for
not
only
were
the
accusers
of
various
persons
brought
to
trial
but
those
who
had
condemned
them
were
in
turn
sentenced
so
it
was
that
tiberius
spared
no
one
but
kept
using
up
all
the
citizens
one
against
another
no
firm
friendships
existed
any
longer
but
the
unjust
and
the
guiltless
the
fearful
and
the
fearless
stood
on
the
same
footing
as
regarded
the
investigation
made
into
the
complaints
about
sejanus
at
length
he
saw
fit
to
propose
a
kind
of
amnesty
for
the
sufferers
and
so
he
gave
permission
to
those
who
wished
to
go
into
mourning
for
the
deceased
and
in
addition
he
forbade
that
any
one
should
in
any
way
be
hindered
from
showing
this
respect
to
the
memory
of
any
person
for
such
prohibitory
votes
were
frequently
passed
yet
he
did
not
in
fact
confirm
this
edict
but
after
a
brief
space
he
punished
numbers
on
account
of
sejanus
and
on
other
complaints
they
were
generally
charged
with
having
outraged
and
murdered
their
nearest
female
relatives
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
at
this
time
and
there
was
not
a
soul
that
could
deny
that
he
would
be
glad
to
feast
on
the
flesh
now
the
next
year
when
gnæus
domitius
and
camillus
scribonianus
became
consuls
a
very
laughable
thing
happened
it
had
now
long
been
the
custom
for
the
members
of
the
senate
on
the
first
of
the
year
to
take
the
oath
not
man
by
man
but
for
one
as
i
have
stated
to
take
the
oath
for
them
and
the
rest
to
express
their
acquiescence
this
time
however
they
did
not
do
so
but
of
their
own
motion
without
any
compulsion
they
were
separately
and
individually
pledged
as
though
this
would
make
them
any
more
regardful
of
their
oath
previously
for
many
years
the
emperor
had
allowed
matters
to
go
on
without
a
single
person
swearing
allegiance
to
his
acts
of
government
this
i
have
mentioned
at
this
time
also
there
occurred
something
else
still
more
laughable
they
voted
that
he
should
select
as
many
of
their
number
as
he
liked
and
should
employ
twenty
of
them
whomsoever
the
lot
should
designate
as
guards
with
daggers
as
often
as
he
entered
the
of
course
as
the
exterior
of
the
building
was
watched
by
the
soldiers
and
no
private
citizen
could
come
inside
their
resolution
that
a
guard
be
given
him
amounted
to
a
precaution
against
no
one
but
themselves
thus
indicating
that
they
were
hostile
naturally
tiberius
expressed
his
obligations
to
them
and
thanked
them
for
their
good
intentions
but
he
rejected
their
offer
as
being
too
much
out
of
the
ordinary
he
was
not
so
simple
as
to
give
swords
to
the
very
men
whom
he
hated
and
by
whom
he
was
hated
yet
as
a
result
of
this
very
measure
he
began
to
grow
suspicious
of
them
for
every
act
in
contravention
of
sincerity
which
one
undertakes
for
the
purpose
of
flattery
breeds
suspicion
and
bidding
a
long
adieu
to
their
decrees
he
began
to
honor
the
pretorians
both
by
addresses
and
with
money
in
spite
of
his
knowledge
that
they
had
been
on
the
side
of
sejanus
so
that
he
might
find
them
more
disposed
to
be
employed
against
the
senators
on
occasion
to
be
sure
he
in
turn
commended
the
latter
when
they
voted
that
funds
from
the
public
treasury
be
bestowed
on
the
guardsmen
he
kept
alternately
deceiving
the
one
party
by
his
talk
and
winning
over
the
other
party
by
his
acts
in
a
most
effective
way
for
instance
junius
gallic
had
moved
that
a
spectacle
be
provided
in
the
meeting
place
of
the
knights
for
those
of
the
who
had
finished
their
term
of
service
tiberius
did
not
merely
banish
him
when
the
man
was
brought
up
on
this
very
charge
of
giving
an
impression
that
he
was
persuading
the
soldiers
to
show
to
the
government
rather
than
to
the
emperor
no
but
when
he
found
that
junius
was
setting
sail
for
lesbos
he
deprived
him
of
a
safe
and
comfortable
existence
there
and
delivered
him
to
the
custody
of
the
magistrates
as
he
had
once
done
with
gallus
and
in
order
to
assure
the
two
classes
still
more
fully
how
he
felt
toward
both
of
them
he
not
long
after
asked
the
senate
that
macro
and
some
military
tribunes
be
deemed
sufficient
to
conduct
him
to
the
he
had
no
need
of
those
persons
for
he
had
no
idea
of
ever
entering
the
city
again
but
what
he
wanted
was
to
display
his
hatred
of
the
senators
and
show
the
latter
the
friendliness
of
the
soldiers
the
senators
actually
granted
this
request
however
they
attached
to
the
decree
a
clause
that
the
escort
should
be
searched
on
entering
to
make
sure
that
no
one
had
a
dagger
hidden
beneath
his
this
resolution
was
passed
in
the
following
year
at
this
time
he
spared
among
some
others
who
had
been
intimate
with
sejanus
lucius
cæsianus
a
prætor
and
marcus
terentius
a
knight
he
overlooked
the
behavior
of
the
former
who
at
the
floralia
to
ridicule
tiberius
had
had
everything
up
to
midnight
done
by
baldheaded
men
because
the
emperor
himself
was
also
baldheaded
and
had
furnished
light
to
those
leaving
the
theatre
by
the
hands
of
five
thousand
boys
with
shaven
pates
tiberius
was
so
far
from
becoming
angry
at
him
that
he
pretended
not
to
have
heard
about
it
at
all
though
all
baldheaded
persons
were
from
then
on
called
caesiani
after
this
man
terentius
he
spared
because
when
on
trial
for
his
friendship
with
sejanus
he
not
only
did
not
deny
it
but
affirmed
that
he
had
worked
for
him
and
paid
court
to
him
to
the
greatest
possible
extent
for
the
reason
that
the
minister
was
so
highly
honored
by
tiberius
himself
consequently
he
said
if
the
emperor
did
rightly
in
having
such
a
friend
neither
have
i
done
any
wrong
and
if
my
sovereign
who
knows
all
things
accurately
erred
what
wonder
is
it
that
i
shared
his
deception
our
duty
is
to
cherish
all
whom
he
honors
without
concerning
ourselves
overmuch
about
the
kind
of
men
they
are
but
making
one
thing
determine
our
friendship
for
them
the
fact
that
they
please
the
emperor
the
senate
for
these
reasons
acquitted
him
and
in
addition
rebuked
his
accusers
tiberius
concurred
with
them
when
piso
the
praefectus
urbi
died
he
honored
him
with
a
public
funeral
a
distinction
granted
also
to
others
in
his
place
he
chose
lucius
lamia
whom
he
had
long
ago
put
in
charge
of
syria
and
was
keeping
at
rome
he
took
similar
action
too
in
the
case
of
many
others
really
caring
nothing
at
all
for
them
but
making
an
outward
show
of
honoring
meantime
vitrasius
pollio
governor
of
egypt
died
and
he
entrusted
the
province
for
a
time
to
one
hiberus
a
cæsarian
now
of
the
consuls
domitius
held
office
the
whole
year
through
for
he
was
husband
of
agrippina
the
daughter
of
germanicus
but
the
rest
adapted
themselves
to
the
whims
of
tiberius
some
he
elevated
for
a
longer
time
and
some
for
a
shorter
some
he
stopped
before
the
end
of
their
appointed
term
and
others
he
allowed
to
hold
office
beyond
the
limits
designated
not
infrequently
he
would
appoint
a
man
for
an
entire
year
and
then
depose
him
setting
up
another
and
still
another
in
his
place
sometimes
after
choosing
certain
substitutes
for
third
place
he
would
then
have
others
become
consuls
before
them
in
the
place
of
still
others
these
irregularities
in
the
case
of
the
consuls
occurred
through
practically
his
entire
reign
of
the
candidates
for
the
other
offices
he
selected
as
many
as
he
wished
and
sent
their
names
to
the
senate
recommending
some
to
that
body
and
these
were
chosen
by
acclamation
but
making
others
depend
upon
their
own
claims
or
the
assent
of
the
senate
or
the
decision
of
the
lot
after
that
in
order
to
follow
out
ancient
precedent
such
as
belonged
to
the
people
and
the
plebs
went
before
one
of
these
two
bodies
and
were
announced
this
is
the
same
practice
that
is
followed
at
present
intended
to
produce
at
least
an
appearance
of
valid
election
in
case
there
was
ever
a
deficiency
of
candidates
or
they
became
involved
in
irreconcilable
strife
a
smaller
number
was
the
following
year
in
which
servius
galba
that
later
became
emperor
and
lucius
cornelius
held
the
consular
title
fifteen
prætors
held
office
this
went
on
for
many
years
so
that
sometimes
sixteen
and
sometimes
one
or
two
less
were
chosen
the
next
move
of
tiberius
was
to
approach
the
capital
and
sojourn
in
its
environs
he
did
not
however
go
within
the
walls
although
he
was
but
thirty
stades
distant
so
that
he
bestowed
in
marriage
the
remaining
daughters
of
germanicus
and
also
julia
the
daughter
of
drusus
hence
the
city
did
not
make
a
festival
of
their
marriages
but
everything
went
on
as
usual
the
senators
met
and
decided
judicial
cases
for
tiberius
made
an
important
point
of
their
assembling
as
often
as
he
would
have
convened
them
and
insisted
on
their
not
arriving
later
or
departing
earlier
than
the
time
fixed
he
sent
to
the
consuls
many
injunctions
on
this
head
and
once
ordered
certain
statements
to
be
read
aloud
by
them
he
behaved
in
the
same
way
in
regard
to
certain
other
matters
just
as
if
he
could
not
write
directly
to
the
senate
to
that
body
he
sent
in
not
only
the
documents
given
him
by
the
informers
but
also
the
confessions
under
torture
which
macro
obtained
so
that
nothing
was
left
in
the
hands
of
the
senators
save
the
vote
of
condemnation
about
this
time
however
a
certain
vibullius
agrippa
a
knight
swallowed
poison
from
a
ring
and
died
in
the
itself
and
nerva
who
could
no
longer
endure
the
emperor
society
starved
himself
to
death
his
chief
reason
for
doing
so
being
that
tiberius
had
reaffirmed
the
laws
on
contracts
enacted
by
cæsar
which
were
sure
to
result
in
great
loss
of
confidence
and
upheaval
and
although
his
chief
repeatedly
urged
him
to
utter
some
word
he
refused
to
answer
these
events
seemed
to
make
some
impression
on
the
emperor
and
he
modified
the
situation
so
far
as
it
pertained
to
loans
by
giving
two
thousand
five
hundred
myriads
to
the
public
treasury
under
the
arrangement
that
this
money
could
be
lent
out
by
the
senatorial
party
without
interest
for
three
years
to
such
as
desired
it
he
further
commanded
that
the
most
notorious
of
those
who
had
steadily
acted
as
accusers
should
be
put
to
death
on
one
day
and
when
a
man
who
belonged
to
the
centurions
wished
to
lodge
information
against
some
one
he
forbade
that
any
person
who
had
served
in
the
army
should
do
so
although
he
allowed
the
privilege
to
knights
and
senators
there
is
no
denying
that
he
received
praise
for
his
behavior
in
these
matters
and
most
of
all
because
he
would
not
accept
a
number
of
honors
that
were
voted
to
him
for
it
but
the
sensual
orgies
which
he
carried
on
shamelessly
with
the
individuals
of
highest
rank
male
and
female
alike
caused
ill
to
be
spoken
of
him
for
example
there
was
the
case
of
his
friend
sextus
marius
imperial
favor
had
made
this
man
so
rich
and
so
powerful
that
when
he
was
once
at
odds
with
a
neighbor
he
invited
him
to
dine
for
two
successive
days
on
the
first
he
razed
his
guest
dwelling
entirely
to
the
ground
and
on
the
next
he
rebuilt
it
on
a
larger
scale
and
in
more
elaborate
style
the
victim
of
his
treatment
declared
his
ignorance
of
the
perpetrators
whereupon
marius
admitted
being
responsible
for
both
occurrences
and
added
significantly
this
shows
you
that
i
have
both
the
knowledge
and
the
power
to
repel
attacks
and
also
to
requite
a
kindness
this
friend
then
who
had
sent
his
daughter
a
strikingly
beautiful
girl
to
a
place
of
refuge
to
prevent
her
being
outraged
by
tiberius
was
charged
with
having
criminal
relations
with
her
and
for
that
reason
destroyed
both
his
daughter
and
himself
all
this
covered
the
emperor
with
disgrace
and
his
connection
with
the
death
of
drusus
and
agrippina
gave
him
a
reputation
for
cruelty
men
had
been
thinking
all
along
that
the
whole
of
the
previous
action
against
these
two
was
due
to
sejanus
and
had
been
hoping
that
now
their
lives
would
be
spared
so
when
they
learned
that
they
had
been
actually
murdered
they
were
exceedingly
grieved
partly
for
the
reasons
mentioned
and
partly
because
so
far
from
depositing
their
bones
in
the
imperial
tomb
tiberius
ordered
their
remains
to
be
hidden
so
carefully
in
the
earth
that
they
might
never
be
found
in
addition
to
agrippina
munatia
plancina
was
slain
previous
to
this
time
though
he
hated
her
not
on
account
of
germanicus
but
for
another
reason
he
yet
allowed
her
to
live
to
prevent
agrippina
from
rejoicing
at
her
death
besides
doing
this
he
appointed
gaius
quaestor
though
not
of
first
rank
promising
him
however
that
he
would
advance
him
to
the
other
office
five
years
earlier
than
was
customary
at
the
same
time
he
requested
the
senate
not
to
make
the
young
man
conceited
by
numerous
or
extraordinary
honors
for
fear
the
latter
might
go
astray
in
one
way
or
another
he
had
indeed
a
descendant
in
the
person
of
tiberius
but
him
he
disregarded
both
on
account
of
age
he
was
a
mere
child
as
yet
and
on
account
of
the
prevailing
suspicion
that
this
boy
was
not
the
son
of
drusus
he
therefore
clove
to
gaius
as
the
most
eligible
candidate
for
sole
ruler
especially
as
he
felt
sure
that
tiberius
would
live
but
a
short
time
and
would
be
murdered
by
that
very
man
there
was
no
detail
of
the
character
of
gaius
of
which
he
was
in
ignorance
indeed
he
once
remarked
to
his
successor
who
was
quarreling
with
tiberius
you
will
kill
him
and
others
will
kill
you
the
emperor
knew
of
no
one
else
that
suited
him
so
entirely
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
well
aware
that
the
man
would
be
a
thorough
knave
yet
the
story
obtains
that
he
was
glad
to
give
him
the
empire
in
order
that
his
own
crimes
might
find
concealment
in
the
enormity
of
gaius
offences
and
that
the
largest
and
the
noblest
portion
of
what
was
left
of
the
senate
might
perish
after
him
at
all
events
he
is
said
to
have
often
uttered
the
ancient
saying
when
i
am
dead
let
fire
the
earth
often
also
he
declared
priam
fortunate
because
that
king
involved
his
country
and
his
throne
in
his
own
utter
ruin
these
records
about
him
are
given
a
semblance
of
reality
by
what
took
place
in
those
days
such
a
multitude
of
the
senators
and
of
others
lost
their
lives
that
out
of
the
officials
chosen
by
lot
the
held
the
governorship
of
the
provinces
for
three
years
and
the
for
six
owing
to
the
lack
of
persons
to
succeed
them
and
what
name
could
one
properly
give
to
the
elected
magistrates
whom
from
the
first
he
allowed
to
hold
office
for
an
unusually
long
time
now
among
those
who
died
at
this
time
was
also
gallus
tiberius
himself
said
that
only
then
and
scarcely
even
so
did
he
become
reconciled
with
him
thus
it
was
that
contrary
to
the
usual
custom
he
inflicted
upon
some
life
as
a
punishment
and
bestowed
upon
others
death
as
a
kindness
the
twentieth
year
of
the
emperor
reign
now
came
in
and
he
himself
though
he
sojourned
in
the
vicinity
of
albanum
and
tusculum
did
not
enter
the
city
the
consuls
lucius
vitellius
and
fabius
persicus
celebrated
the
second
period
the
senators
so
termed
it
in
preference
to
period
to
signify
that
they
were
granting
him
the
leadership
of
the
state
again
as
had
been
done
in
the
case
of
augustus
punishment
overtook
them
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
celebrating
the
appropriate
festival
this
time
none
of
those
accused
was
acquitted
but
all
were
convicted
the
majority
from
documents
contributed
by
tiberius
and
the
statements
under
torture
obtained
by
macro
the
rest
by
what
these
two
suspected
they
were
planning
it
was
rumored
that
the
real
reason
why
tiberius
did
not
come
to
rome
was
to
avoid
being
disgraced
while
present
by
the
sentences
of
condemnation
among
various
persons
who
perished
either
at
the
hands
of
the
executioners
or
by
their
own
acts
was
pomponius
labeo
he
who
had
once
governed
moesia
for
eight
years
after
his
prætorship
was
with
his
wife
indicted
for
receiving
bribes
and
voluntarily
destroyed
both
her
and
himself
mamercus
aemilius
scaurus
on
the
other
hand
who
had
never
governed
anybody
nor
received
bribes
was
convicted
because
of
a
tragedy
and
fell
a
victim
to
a
worse
fate
than
any
he
had
depicted
atreus
was
the
name
of
the
composition
and
in
the
manner
of
euripides
it
advised
some
one
of
the
subjects
of
that
monarch
to
endure
the
folly
of
the
ruling
prince
tiberius
when
he
heard
of
it
declared
that
the
verse
had
been
composed
against
him
at
this
juncture
and
that
atreus
was
merely
a
pretence
used
on
account
of
that
monarch
bloodthirstiness
and
adding
quietly
i
will
have
him
play
the
part
of
ajax
he
brought
pressure
to
bear
to
make
him
commit
suicide
the
above
was
not
the
accusation
made
against
him
instead
he
was
charged
with
having
kept
up
a
with
livilla
many
others
had
been
punished
on
her
account
some
with
good
reason
and
some
as
the
result
of
blackmail
while
matters
at
rome
were
in
this
condition
the
subject
territory
was
not
quiet
either
the
very
moment
a
certain
youth
who
declared
he
was
drusus
appeared
in
the
region
of
greece
and
ionia
the
cities
both
received
him
enthusiastically
and
supported
his
cause
he
would
have
proceeded
to
syria
and
taken
possession
of
the
legions
had
not
some
one
recognized
him
and
putting
an
end
to
his
success
taken
him
to
tiberius
after
this
gaius
gallus
and
marcus
servilius
became
consuls
tiberius
was
at
antium
holding
fête
in
honor
of
the
nuptials
of
gaius
not
even
for
such
a
purpose
would
he
enter
rome
because
of
the
case
of
one
fulcinius
trio
the
latter
who
had
been
a
friend
of
sejanus
but
had
stood
high
in
the
favor
of
tiberius
on
account
of
his
readiness
at
blackmail
was
when
accused
delivered
up
for
punishment
and
through
fear
he
slew
himself
beforehand
after
abusing
roundly
both
the
emperor
and
macro
in
his
testament
his
children
did
not
dare
to
publish
it
but
tiberius
learning
what
had
been
written
ordered
it
to
be
presented
before
the
senate
little
did
he
trouble
himself
about
such
matters
sometimes
he
would
voluntarily
give
to
the
public
denunciations
of
his
conduct
that
were
being
kept
secret
as
another
man
would
eulogies
indeed
he
took
all
that
drusus
had
uttered
in
distress
and
misfortune
and
this
too
he
sent
in
to
the
so
much
then
for
the
death
of
trio
poppaeus
sabinus
who
had
governed
both
the
mysias
and
macedonia
besides
during
almost
all
the
reign
of
tiberius
up
to
this
time
withdrew
from
life
with
the
greatest
before
any
charge
could
be
brought
against
him
he
was
succeeded
by
regulus
with
equal
authority
for
according
to
some
reports
macedonia
and
achaea
were
both
assigned
to
the
new
ruler
without
lots
being
cast
for
them
about
the
same
period
artabanus
the
parthian
after
the
death
of
artaxias
bestowed
armenia
upon
his
son
arsaces
when
no
vengeance
fell
upon
him
from
tiberius
for
this
move
he
made
an
attempt
upon
cappadocia
and
treated
the
parthians
too
rather
haughtily
consequently
some
revolted
from
him
and
went
on
an
embassy
to
tiberius
asking
a
king
for
themselves
from
among
those
serving
as
hostages
he
sent
them
at
once
phraates
son
of
phraates
and
at
the
death
of
the
latter
which
occurred
on
the
way
tiridates
who
was
himself
also
of
the
royal
race
to
insure
his
securing
the
throne
as
easily
as
possible
the
emperor
wrote
orders
to
mithridates
the
iberian
to
invade
armenia
so
that
artabanus
should
leave
home
and
assist
his
son
things
turned
out
as
planned
but
the
reign
of
tiridates
lasted
only
a
short
time
for
artabanus
got
the
scythians
on
his
side
and
had
no
great
difficulty
in
expelling
him
so
much
for
the
parthian
armenia
fell
into
the
hands
of
mithridates
son
of
mithridates
the
iberian
of
course
and
a
brother
of
pharasmanes
who
became
king
of
the
iberians
after
when
sextus
papinius
became
consul
with
quintus
plautius
the
tiber
inundated
a
large
part
of
the
city
so
that
it
remained
under
water
and
a
much
more
extensive
section
in
the
vicinity
of
the
hippodrome
and
the
aventine
was
devastated
by
fire
in
view
of
these
disasters
tiberius
gave
two
thousand
five
hundred
myriads
to
those
who
had
suffered
any
loss
and
if
egyptian
affairs
also
touch
roman
interests
at
all
it
might
be
mentioned
that
that
year
the
phoenix
was
seen
all
these
events
were
thought
to
foreshadow
the
death
of
tiberius
thrasyllus
died
at
this
very
time
and
the
emperor
himself
in
the
following
spring
in
the
consulship
of
gnaeus
proculus
and
pontius
nigrinus
it
chanced
that
macro
had
plotted
against
domitius
and
numerous
others
and
had
devised
complaints
and
tortures
against
them
not
all
that
were
accused
however
were
put
to
death
because
thrasyllus
handled
tiberius
very
cleverly
concerning
himself
he
stated
very
accurately
both
the
day
and
the
hour
in
which
he
should
die
but
he
falsely
declared
that
the
emperor
would
live
ten
more
years
in
order
that
the
latter
feeling
he
had
a
moderately
long
time
to
live
might
be
in
no
hurry
to
kill
them
the
issue
justified
the
plan
thinking
that
it
would
be
possible
for
him
later
to
do
whatever
he
liked
at
his
leisure
he
made
no
haste
in
any
way
and
showed
no
anger
when
the
senate
in
consideration
of
the
opposition
to
the
tortures
expressed
by
the
magistrates
postponed
the
sentencing
of
the
prisoners
yet
pitiable
scenes
were
not
wanting
one
woman
wounded
herself
was
carried
into
the
senate
and
from
there
to
prison
where
she
died
lucius
arruntius
distinguished
both
for
his
age
and
for
his
education
destroyed
himself
voluntarily
when
tiberius
was
already
sick
and
was
not
thought
likely
to
recover
the
man
was
aware
of
the
evil
character
of
gaius
and
desired
to
depart
before
he
should
taste
of
it
saying
i
can
not
in
my
old
age
become
the
slave
of
a
new
master
like
him
still
others
were
saved
some
who
had
actually
been
condemned
but
were
not
permitted
to
die
before
the
expiration
of
ten
days
and
others
because
their
trial
was
again
put
off
when
the
judges
learned
that
tiberius
was
seriously
ailing
he
passed
away
at
misenum
before
he
could
learn
anything
of
this
he
had
been
sick
for
a
considerable
time
but
expecting
to
live
as
thrasyllus
had
foretold
he
neither
consulted
physicians
nor
changed
his
way
of
life
wasting
away
gradually
as
he
was
in
old
age
and
subject
to
a
sickness
that
was
not
severe
he
would
often
all
but
expire
and
then
recover
strength
again
these
changes
would
cause
gaius
and
the
rest
first
great
pleasure
when
they
thought
he
was
going
to
die
and
then
great
fear
when
they
thought
he
would
live
his
successor
therefore
fearing
that
his
health
might
actually
be
restored
refused
his
requests
for
anything
to
eat
on
the
ground
that
he
would
be
injured
and
pretending
that
he
needed
warmth
wrapped
many
thick
cloths
about
him
in
this
way
he
smothered
him
with
a
certain
amount
of
help
to
be
sure
from
macro
the
latter
as
tiberius
was
already
seriously
ill
was
paying
his
court
to
the
young
man
particularly
as
he
had
before
this
succeeded
in
making
him

in

book
book
boissevain
this
then
is
the
tradition
about
tiberius
his
successor
was
gaius
son
of
germanicus
and
agrippina
who
was
known
also
as
i
have
stated
by
the
nicknames
of
germanicus
and
caligula
tiberius
had
left
the
empire
partly
in
charge
of
his
grandson
tiberius
but
gaius
had
his
will
carried
to
the
senate
by
macro
and
caused
it
to
be
declared
null
and
void
by
the
consuls
and
the
rest
with
whom
he
had
made
previous
arrangements
on
the
ground
that
the
author
of
the
document
had
not
been
of
sound
mind
this
was
evidenced
by
his
allowing
a
mere
boy
to
rule
them
who
had
not
yet
the
right
even
to
enter
the
senate
thus
did
gaius
at
this
time
separate
the
lad
from
imperial
office
and
later
in
spite
of
having
adopted
him
he
slew
him
of
no
avail
was
the
fact
that
tiberius
in
his
testament
still
extant
had
written
the
same
words
over
in
a
number
of
ways
as
if
this
would
lend
them
some
force
nor
yet
that
all
of
it
had
been
at
this
time
read
aloud
by
macro
before
the
senatorial
body
for
no
injunction
can
have
weight
against
the
intentional
misunderstanding
or
the
power
of
one
successors
tiberius
suffered
the
same
treatment
he
had
accorded
to
his
mother
wishes
save
that
he
discharged
none
of
the
obligations
imposed
by
her
will
in
the
case
of
any
person
whereas
all
his
bequests
were
paid
to
all
the
beneficiaries
save
to
his
grandson
this
of
course
made
it
perfectly
plain
that
the
whole
fault
found
with
the
will
had
been
invented
on
account
of
the
lad
gaius
need
not
have
published
it
since
he
was
not
unacquainted
with
the
contents
but
inasmuch
as
many
knew
what
was
in
it
and
it
seemed
likely
that
he
himself
on
the
one
hand
or
the
senate
on
the
other
would
be
blamed
for
its
suppression
he
chose
rather
to
have
the
latter
body
overthrow
it
than
to
conceal
the
document
at
the
same
time
by
paying
all
the
bequests
of
the
dead
emperor
as
if
they
were
his
own
to
every
one
concerned
he
gained
among
the
many
a
certain
reputation
for
nobility
of
character
in
company
with
the
senate
he
inspected
the
pretorians
while
they
were
busy
with
exercises
and
distributed
to
them
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
denarii
apiece
that
had
been
bequeathed
and
he
added
as
a
gift
as
many
more
to
the
people
he
paid
the
one
thousand
one
hundred
and
myriads
this
was
the
amount
bequeathed
to
them
and
in
addition
the
sixty
denarii
per
man
which
they
had
failed
to
receive
on
the
occasion
of
his
enrollment
among
the
iuvenes
this
with
interest
amounting
to
fifteen
denarii
more
he
also
settled
the
bequests
to
the
citizen
force
to
the
to
those
of
the
regular
army
outside
italy
and
to
any
other
army
of
native
romans
in
the
smaller
forts
that
is
the
citizens
proper
received
one
hundred
denarii
each
and
all
the
rest
he
behaved
in
this
same
way
also
in
regard
to
livia
will
executing
all
the
provisions
of
it
if
he
had
spent
the
rest
of
his
money
with
equal
propriety
he
would
nave
been
thought
prudent
and
munificent
sometimes
through
fear
of
the
people
and
the
soldiers
he
did
so
act
but
it
was
mostly
through
whims
at
such
times
he
discharged
not
only
the
obligations
of
tiberius
but
those
of
his
and
debts
owing
to
private
individuals
as
well
as
to
others
as
it
was
he
lavished
boundless
sums
upon
dancers
whose
recall
he
at
once
effected
upon
horses
upon
gladiators
and
everything
of
that
sort
and
so
in
an
inconceivably
short
time
he
had
exhausted
the
treasures
which
had
grown
so
great
and
at
the
same
time
convicted
himself
of
having
done
it
through
a
sort
of
temper
and
indecision
he
had
found
accumulated
five
myriad
myriads
seven
thousand
five
hundred
denarii
or
according
to
others
eight
myriad
myriads
two
thousand
five
hundred
and
yet
could
not
keep
any
part
of
it
to
the
third
year
but
actually
in
the
second
season
fell
in
need
of
a
great
deal
besides
he
went
through
the
same
process
of
deterioration
too
in
almost
all
other
respects
at
first
he
seemed
a
most
democratic
person
and
would
send
no
letters
either
to
the
people
or
to
the
senate
nor
assume
any
of
the
titles
of
sovereignty
yet
he
became
most
dictatorial
so
that
he
took
in
one
day
all
those
honors
which
augustus
had
with
difficulty
secured
voted
one
by
one
during
the
long
extent
of
his
reign
some
of
which
tiberius
had
refused
to
accept
at
all
he
postponed
nothing
except
the
title
of
and
that
he
acquired
after
no
long
time
though
he
had
proved
himself
the
most
libidinous
of
men
had
seduced
one
woman
already
betrothed
and
had
dragged
others
from
their
husbands
he
afterward
hated
them
all
save
one
and
he
would
certainly
have
detested
her
had
he
lived
any
longer
toward
his
mother
his
sisters
and
his
grandmother
antonia
he
conducted
himself
in
the
most
dutiful
manner
possible
the
last
named
he
immediately
saluted
as
augusta
and
appointed
her
priestess
of
augustus
giving
her
at
once
all
the
privileges
pertaining
to
the
vestal
virgins
to
his
sisters
he
assigned
these
honors
of
the
vestal
virgins
the
right
to
witness
in
the
same
section
of
seats
with
him
and
the
right
to
have
uttered
in
their
behalf
as
well
the
prayers
which
were
annually
offered
by
the
magistrates
and
the
priests
for
his
welfare
and
that
of
the
state
and
the
oaths
of
allegiance
sworn
to
his
empire
he
set
sail
himself
and
with
his
own
hands
collected
and
brought
back
the
bones
of
his
mother
and
of
his
brothers
that
had
died
wearing
the
toga
and
attended
by
some
lictors
as
at
a
triumph
he
deposited
these
in
the
monument
of
augustus
all
measures
voted
against
them
he
canceled
all
who
had
plotted
against
them
he
chastised
and
recalled
such
as
were
in
exile
on
their
now
though
he
had
done
all
this
he
showed
himself
the
most
impious
of
men
in
the
case
both
of
his
grandmother
and
of
his
sisters
the
former
because
she
had
rebuked
him
for
something
he
forced
to
seek
death
by
her
own
hand
and
after
ravishing
all
his
sisters
he
shut
two
of
them
up
on
an
island
the
third
had
previously
died
again
in
the
matter
of
tiberius
whom
he
also
termed
grandfather
he
asked
that
he
might
receive
from
the
senate
the
same
honors
as
augustus
but
these
were
not
immediately
voted
for
the
senators
could
not
endure
to
honor
that
tyrant
nor
did
they
make
bold
to
dishonor
him
because
they
were
not
yet
clearly
acquainted
with
the
character
of
their
young
lord
and
consequently
postponed
everything
until
the
latter
should
be
present
so
then
gaius
bestowed
upon
him
no
mark
of
notice
other
than
a
public
funeral
after
bringing
the
body
into
the
city
by
night
and
having
it
laid
out
at
daybreak
and
though
he
did
make
a
speech
over
it
he
did
not
say
so
much
in
praise
of
tiberius
as
he
did
to
remind
the
people
of
augustus
and
germanicus
comparing
himself
meanwhile
with
them
gaius
inevitably
went
so
by
contraries
in
every
matter
that
he
not
only
emulated
but
even
surpassed
his
predecessor
licentiousness
and
bloodthirstiness
for
which
he
had
censured
him
but
of
the
qualities
he
had
praised
in
him
he
imitated
not
one
though
he
had
been
the
first
to
insult
him
the
first
to
abuse
him
so
that
others
thinking
to
please
him
in
this
way
made
use
of
rather
heedless
freedom
of
speech
he
later
lauded
and
magnified
tiberius
going
to
the
point
of
punishing
some
for
what
they
had
said
these
as
enemies
of
the
former
emperor
he
hated
for
their
injurious
remarks
and
he
hated
equally
those
who
in
way
praised
tiberius
as
being
the
latter
friends
though
he
had
put
an
end
to
complaints
arising
from
maiestas
he
made
these
the
cause
of
many
persons
downfall
though
according
to
his
own
account
he
dismissed
the
anger
that
he
felt
toward
those
who
had
united
against
his
father
and
his
mother
and
his
brothers
and
burned
their
letters
he
yet
put
to
death
great
numbers
of
them
on
the
basis
of
evidence
contained
in
such
documents
he
did
to
be
sure
really
destroy
some
papers
but
not
those
which
held
definite
incontrovertible
proof
of
these
he
made
copies
besides
though
he
at
first
forbade
any
one
to
set
up
his
images
he
went
on
to
manufacture
the
statues
himself
whereas
once
he
requested
the
annulment
of
a
decree
that
sacrifice
should
be
offered
to
his
fortune
and
had
this
action
of
his
inscribed
on
a
tablet
he
afterward
ordered
temples
and
sacrifices
to
be
prepared
for
him
as
for
some
god
he
delighted
by
turns
in
vast
throngs
of
men
and
in
solitude
he
grew
angry
if
requests
were
preferred
or
if
they
were
not
preferred
he
would
start
out
on
enterprises
with
the
greatest
amount
of
dash
and
then
carry
them
through
in
the
most
sluggish
manner
he
both
spent
money
most
unsparingly
and
showed
a
thoroughly
sordid
spirit
in
exacting
it
he
was
alike
irritated
and
pleased
both
at
those
who
flattered
him
and
at
those
who
spoke
their
own
minds
many
who
were
guilty
of
great
crimes
he
neglected
to
punish
and
many
who
had
done
no
wrong
he
ruthlessly
slaughtered
among
his
associates
he
made
some
the
recipients
of
excessive
adulation
and
others
of
excessive
insult
consequently
no
one
knew
either
what
to
say
or
how
to
act
toward
him
but
all
who
met
with
success
obtained
it
as
the
result
of
chance
rather
than
of
rational
calculation
that
was
the
kind
of
emperor
into
whose
hands
the
romans
had
now
fallen
hence
the
deeds
of
tiberius
though
they
were
felt
to
have
been
most
grievous
were
still
as
far
superior
to
those
of
gaius
as
the
deeds
of
augustus
were
to
those
of
his
successor
for
tiberius
always
held
the
power
in
his
own
hands
and
used
other
people
to
help
him
carry
out
his
wishes
gaius
on
the
other
hand
was
ruled
by
charioteers
and
by
gladiators
he
was
the
slave
of
dancers
and
other
theatrical
performers
indeed
he
always
kept
apelles
the
most
famous
of
the
tragedians
of
that
day
with
him
even
in
public
thus
he
by
himself
and
they
by
themselves
did
without
let
or
hindrance
all
that
such
persons
when
given
power
would
naturally
dare
to
do
everything
that
could
help
theatrical
productions
he
arranged
and
settled
on
the
slightest
pretext
in
the
most
expensive
manner
and
compelled
prætors
and
consuls
to
do
the
same
so
that
almost
every
day
some
performance
of
the
kind
was
sure
to
be
given
originally
he
was
but
a
spectator
and
listener
at
these
and
would
take
sides
for
and
against
various
performers
like
one
of
the
mob
and
sometimes
if
he
were
irritated
at
his
opponents
he
would
not
visit
the
spectacle
but
as
time
went
on
he
came
to
imitate
and
contend
in
many
events
driving
chariots
fighting
duels
giving
exhibitions
of
dancing
and
acting
in
tragedy
this
became
his
regular
practice
and
one
night
he
urgently
summoned
the
leaders
of
the
senate
as
if
to
some
important
deliberation
and
then
danced
before
them
now
in
that
year
that
tiberius
died
and
gaius
entered
upon
office
in
his
stead
he
first
began
to
show
great
deference
to
the
senators
on
an
occasion
when
knights
were
present
at
the
meeting
and
also
some
of
the
populace
he
promised
to
share
his
power
with
them
and
do
whatever
would
please
them
calling
himself
meanwhile
their
son
and
nursling
he
was
then
years
old
lacking
five
months
four
days
after
this
he
freed
those
who
were
in
prison
among
whom
was
quintus
pomponius
who
for
seven
whole
years
after
his
consulship
had
been
kept
in
a
cell
suffering
abuse
gaius
did
away
with
the
complaints
for
maiestas
on
account
of
which
he
saw
that
most
of
the
prisoners
were
suffering
and
heaped
up
or
so
he
pretended
and
burned
the
documents
pertaining
to
their
cases
that
tiberius
had
left
behind
he
also
declared
i
have
done
this
that
no
matter
how
much
i
might
wish
to
bear
malice
toward
any
one
for
my
mother
and
my
brothers
sake
i
might
still
be
unable
to
punish
him
for
this
he
was
commended
because
it
was
expected
that
at
all
events
would
speak
the
truth
by
reason
of
his
youth
it
was
not
thought
possible
that
he
could
be
guilty
of
duplicity
in
thought
or
speech
and
he
still
further
increased
their
hopes
by
ordering
that
the
celebration
of
the
saturnalia
extend
over
five
days
and
by
taking
from
each
of
those
enjoying
an
allowance
of
grain
only
an
as
instead
of
the
denarius
which
they
were
wont
to
give
an
emperor
for
the
manufacture
of
images
it
was
voted
that
he
should
at
once
become
consul
by
the
removal
of
proculus
and
nigrinus
who
were
holding
office
at
the
time
and
that
he
should
thereafter
be
consul
annually
however
he
did
not
accept
the
offer
but
instead
waited
until
the
two
officials
completed
the
six
months
term
for
which
they
had
been
appointed
and
then
became
consul
himself
taking
his
uncle
claudius
as
a
colleague
the
latter
who
had
previously
been
ranked
among
the
knights
and
after
the
death
of
tiberius
had
been
sent
as
an
envoy
to
gaius
in
behalf
of
that
order
now
for
the
first
time
after
living
years
became
both
consul
and
senator
at
once
the
behavior
of
gaius
in
these
matters
appeared
satisfactory
and
to
his
actions
corresponded
the
speech
which
he
delivered
in
the
on
entering
upon
his
consulship
in
it
he
denounced
tiberius
for
each
of
the
crimes
of
which
he
was
commonly
accused
and
made
many
announcements
about
his
own
line
of
conduct
and
the
senate
fearing
that
he
might
change
issued
a
decree
that
his
statements
should
be
read
annually
soon
after
clad
in
the
triumphal
garb
he
dedicated
the
heroüm
of
augustus
boys
of
the
noblest
families
both
of
whose
parents
had
to
be
living
together
with
maidens
similarly
circumstanced
sang
the
hymn
and
the
senators
with
their
wives
as
well
as
the
people
were
banqueted
entertainments
of
all
sorts
were
given
there
were
exhibitions
involving
music
and
horseraces
took
place
on
two
days
twenty
heats
the
first
day
and
forty
more
the
second
because
the
former
was
the
birthday
and
the
latter
that
of
augustus
he
had
a
similar
number
of
events
on
many
other
occasions
as
seemed
good
to
him
hitherto
not
more
than
ten
events
had
been
usual
but
this
time
he
finished
four
hundred
bears
together
with
an
equal
number
of
beasts
from
libya
the
boys
of
noble
birth
performed
troy
on
horseback
and
six
horses
drew
the
triumphal
car
on
which
he
was
borne
this
was
an
innovation
in
the
races
he
did
not
give
the
signals
to
the
charioteers
in
person
but
viewed
the
spectacle
from
a
front
seat
with
his
brothers
and
his
of
the
augustan
order
he
was
always
greatly
displeased
if
any
one
was
absent
from
the
theatre
or
left
in
the
middle
of
the
performance
and
so
in
order
that
no
one
might
have
an
excuse
for
not
attending
he
postponed
all
lawsuits
and
suspended
all
periods
of
mourning
thus
women
bereft
of
their
husbands
were
allowed
to
marry
even
before
the
appointed
time
unless
indeed
they
were
pregnant
in
order
to
enable
people
to
come
without
formality
and
to
save
them
the
trouble
of
greeting
him
for
previously
those
who
met
the
emperor
on
the
streets
always
saluted
him
he
forbade
any
one
doing
this
again
those
who
chose
might
come
barefoot
to
the
spectacles
it
had
been
from
very
ancient
times
the
custom
for
persons
to
do
this
who
held
court
in
the
summer
the
practice
had
been
frequently
followed
by
augustus
at
the
summer
festivals
but
had
been
abandoned
by
tiberius
it
was
at
this
period
that
the
senators
first
began
sitting
upon
cushions
instead
of
the
bare
boards
and
that
they
were
allowed
to
wear
caps
to
the
theatre
thessalian
fashion
to
avoid
distress
from
the
sun
rays
and
whenever
the
sun
was
particularly
severe
they
used
instead
of
the
theatre
the
diribitorium
which
was
furnished
with
this
was
what
gaius
did
in
his
consulship
which
he
held
two
months
and
twelve
days
the
remainder
of
the
six
months
term
he
surrendered
to
the
men
previously
appointed
for
it
it
was
after
this
that
he
fell
sick
but
instead
of
dying
himself
he
managed
to
cause
the
death
of
tiberius
who
had
been
registered
among
the
iuvenes
had
been
given
the
title
of
princeps
iuventutis
and
finally
had
been
adopted
into
his
family
the
complaint
brought
against
the
lad
was
that
he
had
prayed
and
expected
that
gaius
might
die
this
charge
proved
the
destruction
of
many
others
too
the
same
ruler
who
gave
to
antiochus
son
of
antiochus
the
district
of
commagene
which
his
father
had
held
and
likewise
the
coast
districts
of
cilicia
and
had
freed
agrippa
grandson
of
herod
who
had
been
imprisoned
by
tiberius
and
had
put
him
in
charge
of
his
domain
not
only
deprived
agrippa
brother
or
else
his
son
of
his
paternal
fortune
but
furthermore
had
him
murdered
without
making
any
communication
about
him
to
the
senate
later
he
took
similar
action
in
a
number
of
other
cases
now
the
young
tiberius
perished
on
suspicion
of
having
utilized
the
emperor
illness
as
an
occasion
for
conspiracy
on
the
other
hand
there
were
publius
afranius
potitus
a
plebeian
who
in
a
burst
of
foolish
servility
had
promised
not
only
of
his
own
free
will
but
under
oath
that
he
would
give
his
life
to
have
gaius
recover
and
a
certain
atanius
secundus
a
knight
who
announced
that
in
the
event
of
a
favorable
outcome
he
would
fight
as
a
gladiator
these
instead
of
the
money
which
they
hoped
to
receive
from
him
in
return
for
offering
to
die
in
exchange
for
his
life
were
compelled
to
keep
their
promises
so
as
not
to
perjure
themselves
that
was
the
cause
of
these
men
death
again
his
marcus
silanus
though
he
had
made
no
promise
and
taken
no
oath
nevertheless
because
his
virtue
and
his
relationship
made
him
displeasing
to
the
emperor
and
subjected
him
to
extreme
insults
for
this
reason
committed
suicide
tiberius
had
held
him
in
such
honor
as
to
refuse
always
to
try
a
case
that
was
appealed
from
his
jurisdiction
and
to
refer
all
such
disputes
back
to
him
again
but
gaius
abused
him
in
every
way
and
had
such
a
high
opinion
of
him
that
he
called
him
the
golden
sheep
now
silanus
on
account
of
his
age
and
his
reputation
was
accorded
by
all
the
consuls
the
honor
of
casting
his
vote
first
and
to
prevent
his
doing
so
any
longer
gaius
had
abolished
the
custom
of
having
some
of
the
vote
first
or
second
according
to
the
pleasure
of
those
who
put
the
vote
he
arranged
that
such
persons
should
cast
their
votes
on
the
same
footing
as
the
rest
and
in
the
same
order
as
they
had
held
the
office
moreover
he
put
aside
his
victim
daughter
to
marry
cornelia
orestilla
whom
he
had
actually
seized
during
the
marriage
festival
which
she
was
celebrating
with
her
betrothed
gaius
calpurnius
piso
before
two
months
had
elapsed
he
banished
both
of
them
on
the
ground
that
they
had
carnal
knowledge
of
each
other
he
allowed
piso
to
take
with
him
ten
slaves
and
then
when
the
latter
asked
for
more
he
let
him
employ
as
many
as
he
liked
saying
you
will
have
just
so
many
soldiers
the
next
year
marcus
julianus
and
publius
nonius
regularly
appointed
became
consuls
oaths
pertaining
to
the
acts
of
tiberius
were
not
introduced
and
for
this
reason
are
not
used
nowadays
either
no
one
numbers
tiberius
among
the
emperors
in
the
list
of
members
of
his
house
but
in
regard
to
augustus
and
gaius
they
took
the
oaths
which
had
regularly
been
the
custom
and
others
to
the
effect
that
they
would
hold
gaius
and
his
sisters
in
greater
respect
than
themselves
and
their
children
and
they
offered
prayers
for
all
of
them
alike
on
the
very
first
day
of
the
new
year
one
machaon
a
slave
climbed
upon
the
couch
of
jupiter
capitolinus
and
after
uttering
from
that
place
many
dire
prophecies
killed
a
little
dog
which
he
had
brought
in
with
him
and
slew
himself
the
following
good
deeds
must
be
set
down
to
the
credit
of
gaius
he
published
as
augustus
had
done
all
the
accounts
of
public
funds
which
had
not
been
made
known
during
the
time
tiberius
was
out
of
the
city
he
helped
the
soldiers
extinguish
a
conflagration
and
assisted
those
who
suffered
loss
by
it
as
the
equestrian
order
pined
from
lack
of
men
he
summoned
the
foremost
men
from
every
office
even
abroad
and
enrolled
them
with
due
regard
to
their
relatives
and
their
wealth
some
of
them
he
allowed
to
wear
the
senatorial
costume
occasionally
even
before
they
had
held
any
office
through
which
we
enter
the
senate
on
the
strength
of
their
hopes
to
secure
admission
to
that
body
previously
it
would
seem
that
only
those
who
had
been
born
in
the
senatorial
order
were
allowed
to
do
this
these
deeds
caused
pleasure
to
all
but
this
action
in
restoring
the
elections
to
the
populus
and
the
plebs
rescinding
the
decisions
of
tiberius
about
these
matters
and
in
abolishing
the
one
per
cent
tax
and
again
in
scattering
at
some
gymnastic
contest
tickets
and
distributing
very
large
gifts
to
such
as
secured
them
these
actions
though
they
delighted
the
lower
classes
grieved
the
sensible
who
reflected
that
even
if
the
offices
fell
once
more
into
the
hands
of
the
general
public
still
in
case
the
existing
funds
should
be
exhausted
and
private
sources
of
income
fail
many
dreadful
disasters
would
result
the
performances
of
his
next
to
be
enumerated
elicited
the
censure
of
all
without
distinction
he
caused
very
great
numbers
of
men
to
fight
as
gladiators
forcing
them
to
contend
both
separately
and
in
groups
drawn
up
in
a
kind
of
military
formation
he
requested
permission
from
the
senate
to
do
this
and
again
something
quite
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
enacted
law
that
he
might
do
whatsoever
he
pleased
he
asked
leave
to
put
to
death
a
number
of
persons
among
them
knights
some
of
whom
had
already
devoured
their
living
while
others
had
merely
practiced
gladiatorial
combat
it
was
not
the
number
of
those
who
perished
that
was
so
bad
though
it
was
bad
enough
but
his
frenzied
delight
in
their
slaughter
and
his
never
satisfied
gazing
at
the
scene
of
blood
the
same
trait
of
cruelty
led
him
once
when
there
was
a
shortage
of
condemned
criminals
to
be
given
to
the
beasts
to
order
some
of
the
mob
that
stood
near
the
benches
to
be
seized
and
thrown
to
them
and
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
their
making
an
outcry
or
attacking
him
orally
he
had
their
tongues
cut
out
first
of
all
one
of
the
prominent
knights
too
he
compelled
to
fight
in
single
combat
on
the
charge
of
insult
offered
to
his
mother
agrippina
and
when
the
man
proved
victorious
handed
him
over
to
the
accusers
and
had
him
slain
the
same
father
though
guilty
of
no
wrong
he
confined
in
a
cage
as
he
had
confined
numerous
others
and
there
put
an
end
to
these
contests
he
at
first
conducted
in
the
sæpta
after
excavating
the
entire
site
and
filling
it
with
water
to
enable
him
to
bring
in
one
ship
later
he
transferred
his
operations
to
another
place
where
he
tore
down
a
large
number
of
massive
buildings
and
set
up
benches
the
theatre
of
taurus
he
held
in
contempt
all
this
behavior
expenditures
and
murders
alike
subjected
him
to
criticism
he
was
further
blamed
for
compelling
macro
together
with
ennia
to
cause
their
own
death
remembering
neither
the
latter
affection
nor
the
former
benefits
which
had
gained
for
him
among
other
advantages
the
sole
possession
of
the
empire
the
fact
that
he
had
appointed
macro
to
govern
egypt
had
not
the
slightest
influence
he
even
involved
him
in
a
scandal
of
which
the
greatest
share
belonged
to
gaius
himself
by
bringing
against
him
besides
all
the
rest
a
complaint
that
he
had
played
the
pander
before
long
many
others
were
condemned
and
executed
and
some
were
executed
prior
to
their
conviction
nominally
they
suffered
on
account
of
some
wrong
done
to
his
parents
or
his
brothers
or
the
rest
who
had
perished
with
those
relatives
as
an
excuse
but
really
on
account
of
their
property
for
the
treasury
had
been
exhausted
and
he
had
no
resources
such
persons
were
convicted
by
witnesses
against
them
and
by
the
documents
which
he
once
declared
he
had
burned
again
the
disease
which
had
attacked
him
the
previous
year
and
the
death
of
his
sister
drusilla
brought
about
the
ruin
of
others
since
to
omit
graver
cases
whoever
had
entertained
or
had
greeted
any
one
or
had
bathed
on
the
days
in
question
incurred
punishment
the
nominal
spouse
of
drusilla
was
marcus
lepidus
at
once
the
favorite
and
lover
of
the
emperor
but
gaius
also
treated
her
as
a
concubine
when
her
death
occurred
at
this
time
her
husband
delivered
the
eulogy
but
it
was
her
brother
who
accorded
her
a
public
funeral
the
pretorians
with
their
commander
and
the
equestrian
order
by
itself
ran
about
the
pyre
and
the
boys
of
noble
birth
performed
the
troy
exercise
about
her
tomb
all
the
honors
that
had
been
given
to
livia
were
voted
to
her
and
it
was
further
decreed
that
she
should
be
declared
immortal
that
a
figure
in
gold
representing
her
be
set
up
in
the
and
that
in
the
temple
of
venus
in
the
forum
there
should
be
dedicated
with
equal
honors
a
statue
of
her
as
large
as
that
of
the
goddess
moreover
a
separate
shrine
should
be
built
for
her
and
twenty
priests
not
only
men
but
also
women
should
do
her
honor
women
as
often
as
they
gave
testimony
should
swear
by
her
and
on
her
birthday
a
festival
equal
to
the
megalensia
should
be
celebrated
and
the
senate
and
the
knights
should
hold
a
banquet
she
straightway
received
the
name
panthea
and
was
declared
worthy
of
divine
honors
in
all
the
cities
a
certain
livius
geminus
a
senator
stated
on
oath
invoking
destruction
upon
himself
and
his
children
if
he
spoke
falsely
that
he
had
seen
her
ascending
into
heaven
and
holding
converse
with
the
gods
and
he
called
all
the
other
gods
and
panthea
herself
to
witness
for
his
declaration
he
received
myriads
besides
all
this
gaius
showed
her
honor
in
not
having
the
festivals
which
were
then
due
to
take
place
celebrated
either
at
their
appointed
time
except
as
mere
formalities
or
at
any
later
date
all
persons
incurred
equal
censure
whether
they
showed
pleasure
at
anything
as
being
grieved
or
behaved
as
if
they
were
glad
they
were
charged
with
malice
either
in
failing
to
mourn
her
this
was
disrespect
to
her
as
a
mortal
or
in
bewailing
her
this
was
disrespect
to
her
as
a
goddess
one
single
occurrence
gives
the
key
to
all
the
transactions
of
that
time
the
emperor
charged
with
impiety
and
put
to
death
a
man
who
had
sold
warm
water
having
allowed
a
few
days
to
elapse
he
married
lollia
paulina
and
he
compelled
no
less
a
person
than
her
husband
memmius
regulus
to
betroth
her
to
him
so
that
he
might
not
break
the
law
in
taking
her
without
a
betrothal
but
almost
in
a
trice
he
had
driven
her
away
too
meantime
he
granted
to
soaimus
the
land
of
the
arabian
ituræans
to
cotys
lesser
armenia
and
later
parts
of
arabia
to
rhoemetalces
the
possessions
of
cotys
and
to
polemon
son
of
polemon
his
ancestral
domain
all
these
upon
the
vote
of
the
senate
the
ceremony
took
place
in
the
forum
where
he
sat
upon
the
rostra
in
a
chair
between
the
consuls
some
say
he
used
silken
awnings
soon
after
he
caught
sight
of
a
lot
of
mud
in
an
alley
and
ordered
that
it
be
cast
into
the
toga
of
flavius
vespasian
who
was
ædile
at
the
time
and
had
charge
of
keeping
alleys
clean
this
event
was
regarded
at
the
moment
as
of
no
particular
importance
but
later
when
vespasian
who
took
charge
of
a
state
in
confusion
and
turmoil
had
reduced
the
same
to
order
it
seemed
to
have
been
due
to
some
divine
prompting
and
to
have
signified
that
gaius
had
entrusted
the
city
to
him
unconditionally
for
its
amelioration
he
now
became
consul
again
and
though
he
prevented
the
priest
of
jupiter
from
taking
the
oath
in
the
senate
for
at
this
time
they
regularly
did
so
privately
as
in
the
days
of
tiberius
he
himself
both
when
he
entered
upon
office
and
when
he
relinquished
it
took
the
oath
like
the
rest
upon
the
rostra
which
had
been
made
larger
than
before
thirty
days
was
the
duration
of
his
tenure
whereas
he
let
his
colleague
lucius
apronius
hold
office
for
six
months
and
his
successor
was
sanguinius
maximus
præfectus
urbi
during
this
and
the
following
period
numbers
of
the
foremost
men
perished
in
fulfillment
of
a
sentence
of
condemnation
for
many
who
had
been
released
from
prison
were
punished
for
the
very
reasons
that
had
led
to
their
imprisonment
by
tiberius
and
many
others
in
gladiatorial
combats
there
was
nothing
happening
but
slaughter
the
emperor
no
longer
made
any
concessions
to
the
populace
opposing
instead
absolutely
everything
it
wished
and
consequently
the
people
too
resisted
all
his
desires
the
talk
and
actions
usual
at
such
a
juncture
with
an
angry
ruler
on
one
side
and
a
hostile
folk
on
the
other
were
plainly
in
evidence
the
contest
between
them
however
was
not
an
equal
one
the
people
could
do
nothing
outside
of
discussion
and
showing
their
feelings
by
their
demeanor
whereas
gaius
dragged
many
of
his
opponents
away
while
they
were
witnessing
performances
at
the
theatre
and
arrested
many
more
after
they
had
left
the
building
the
chief
causes
for
his
rage
were
first
that
they
did
not
show
enthusiasm
in
attending
he
made
his
appearance
at
a
different
hour
on
different
occasions
sometimes
not
till
nightfall
and
they
were
worn
out
waiting
for
him
second
that
they
did
not
always
applaud
the
performances
that
pleased
him
and
sometimes
even
showed
favor
to
objects
of
his
dislike
again
it
vexed
him
mightily
to
have
them
cry
out
in
their
efforts
to
extol
him
young
augustus
he
felt
that
he
was
not
being
congratulated
upon
being
emperor
while
so
young
but
was
being
censured
for
holding
at
his
age
so
great
a
domain
his
regular
conduct
was
as
described
once
he
said
threateningly
to
the
whole
people
how
i
wish
you
had
one
neck
at
another
time
when
he
was
showing
some
of
his
usual
irritation
the
populace
in
displeasure
ceased
to
notice
the
spectacle
and
turned
against
the
informers
and
with
loud
shouts
demanded
their
surrender
gaius
indignant
vouchsafed
them
no
answer
but
committing
to
others
the
conduct
of
the
games
withdrew
into
campania
later
he
returned
to
celebrate
the
birthday
of
drusilla
brought
into
the
hippodrome
on
a
wagon
her
statue
drawn
by
elephants
and
gave
the
people
a
free
show
for
two
days
the
first
day
besides
the
equestrian
contests
he
had
five
hundred
bears
slaughtered
and
on
the
second
a
like
number
of
libyan
beasts
was
used
up
athletes
struggled
in
the
pancratium
at
many
different
points
in
the
city
the
populace
was
feasted
and
presents
were
given
to
the
senators
and
their
wives
at
the
same
time
that
he
authorized
these
murders
apparently
because
he
was
so
very
poor
he
devised
another
kind
of
transaction
he
took
the
surviving
combatants
and
sold
them
at
an
excessive
valuation
to
the
consuls
the
prætors
and
the
rest
meeting
with
acquiescence
from
some
and
compelling
others
who
objected
strenuously
to
carry
out
his
wishes
at
the
and
most
of
all
he
imposed
upon
the
ones
especially
selected
by
lot
for
this
purpose
for
he
had
ordered
that
two
prætors
just
as
it
might
happen
should
be
allotted
to
take
charge
of
the
gladiatorial
games
he
himself
sat
on
the
auctioneer
platform
and
kept
outbidding
them
many
also
came
from
outside
to
bid
against
them
particularly
because
he
allowed
such
as
wished
to
employ
a
greater
number
of
gladiators
than
the
law
permitted
and
because
he
often
had
recourse
to
them
himself
so
people
bought
them
for
large
sums
some
through
need
of
the
men
others
thinking
they
should
gratify
him
and
the
largest
number
in
case
they
were
reputed
to
be
out
of
a
wish
to
avail
themselves
of
this
pretext
for
spending
some
of
their
substance
and
thus
by
becoming
poorer
save
their
lives
yet
in
spite
of
this
action
of
his
he
afterward
put
out
of
the
way
by
poison
the
best
and
most
famous
of
these
slaves
he
did
the
same
also
in
the
case
of
rival
horses
and
charioteers
being
greatly
devoted
to
the
party
that
wore
the
frog
green
and
from
this
color
was
called
the
party
of
the
leek
even
now
the
place
where
the
chariots
practiced
is
called
galanum
one
of
the
horses
that
he
named
incitatus
he
invited
to
dinner
offered
him
golden
barley
and
drank
his
health
in
wine
from
gold
goblets
he
took
oaths
by
the
same
beast
guardian
spirit
and
presiding
fortune
and
promised
besides
that
he
would
appoint
him
consul
this
he
would
certainly
have
done
too
if
he
had
lived
longer
now
formerly
for
the
purpose
of
providing
funds
it
had
been
voted
that
all
those
persons
who
had
wished
to
leave
anything
to
tiberius
and
were
alive
should
at
their
death
bestow
the
same
upon
gaius
the
publication
of
a
decree
was
deemed
necessary
to
prevent
its
seeming
that
he
could
break
the
laws
in
securing
by
inheritance
such
gifts
for
he
had
at
the
time
neither
wife
nor
children
but
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
he
proceeded
to
levy
for
himself
without
any
vote
absolutely
all
the
property
of
men
who
had
served
among
the
centurions
and
had
after
the
triumph
which
his
father
celebrated
left
it
to
somebody
other
than
the
emperor
when
not
even
this
sufficed
he
hit
upon
the
following
third
means
of
raising
money
there
was
a
senator
gnæus
domitius
corbulo
who
had
noticed
that
the
roads
during
the
reign
of
tiberius
were
in
bad
condition
and
was
always
nagging
the
road
commissioners
about
it
and
furthermore
kept
making
a
nuisance
of
himself
before
the
senate
regarding
the
matter
gaius
took
him
as
a
confederate
and
through
him
attacked
all
those
alive
or
dead
who
had
ever
been
road
commissioners
and
had
received
money
for
repairing
the
highways
he
fined
both
them
and
the
men
who
had
secured
any
contracts
from
them
on
the
pretence
that
they
had
spent
nothing
for
this
help
corbulo
was
at
the
time
made
consul
but
later
in
the
reign
of
claudius
he
was
accused
and
his
conduct
investigated
claudius
made
no
further
demands
for
any
sums
still
owing
and
after
collecting
what
had
been
paid
in
partly
from
the
treasury
and
partly
from
corbulo
he
returned
it
to
the
persons
who
had
been
fined
all
that
was
later
at
this
time
these
unfortunates
one
by
one
and
practically
everybody
else
in
the
city
were
as
one
might
say
despoiled
of
those
who
possessed
anything
there
was
no
one
not
a
man
nor
a
woman
who
got
off
scot
free
though
he
allowed
some
of
the
more
elderly
persons
to
live
yet
by
calling
them
his
fathers
grandfathers
mothers
and
grandmothers
he
got
revenue
from
them
during
their
lifetime
and
inherited
their
property
when
they
died
up
to
this
time
he
was
always
speaking
ill
of
tiberius
before
everybody
and
so
far
from
rebuking
others
who
criticised
him
privately
or
publicly
he
enjoyed
their
language
but
now
he
entered
the
and
eulogized
his
predecessor
at
length
besides
severely
rebuking
the
senate
and
the
people
saying
that
they
did
wrong
in
finding
fault
with
him
i
may
do
even
this
he
said
in
my
capacity
as
emperor
but
you
are
not
only
unjust
but
also
guilty
of
impiety
to
take
such
an
attitude
toward
one
who
ruled
you
thereupon
he
considered
separately
the
case
of
each
man
who
had
lost
his
life
and
showed
to
his
own
satisfaction
that
the
senators
had
been
responsible
for
the
death
of
most
of
them
some
he
alleged
they
had
killed
by
accusation
some
by
damning
evidence
and
all
by
sentence
of
condemnation
this
he
proved
by
having
some
freedmen
read
it
from
those
very
documents
which
he
once
declared
he
had
burned
and
he
told
them
besides
in
case
tiberius
really
did
do
wrong
you
ought
not
to
have
honored
him
while
he
lived
and
at
any
rate
by
jupiter
you
ought
not
to
repudiate
what
you
often
said
and
voted
but
you
both
behaved
toward
him
with
fickleness
and
again
after
filling
sejanus
with
conceit
and
spoiling
him
you
put
him
to
death
and
therefore
i
ought
not
either
to
expect
any
decent
treatment
from
you
after
some
such
remarks
he
represented
in
his
speech
tiberius
himself
as
saying
to
him
all
this
that
you
have
said
has
been
good
and
true
therefore
have
no
affection
nor
mercy
for
any
one
of
them
they
all
hate
you
they
all
pray
for
your
death
they
will
murder
you
if
they
can
hence
do
not
stop
to
consider
what
acts
of
yours
will
please
them
and
heed
none
of
their
talk
rather
have
regard
to
your
own
pleasure
and
safety
solely
since
that
has
the
most
just
claim
in
this
way
you
will
suffer
no
harm
and
will
enjoy
all
supremest
pleasures
you
will
moreover
be
honored
by
them
whether
they
so
desire
or
not
if
you
follow
a
different
course
it
will
be
useless
and
beyond
an
empty
reputation
you
will
gain
no
advantage
but
become
the
victim
of
plots
and
perish
ingloriously
no
man
living
is
ruled
of
his
own
free
will
but
the
element
which
is
kept
in
fear
whatever
its
size
waits
upon
the
stronger
element
whereas
if
it
attains
to
courage
it
always
wreaks
vengeance
upon
the
other
which
has
now
become
the
weaker
at
the
close
of
this
address
gaius
reintroduced
the
complaints
for
maiestas
ordered
his
commands
to
be
inscribed
upon
a
bronze
tablet
and
rushing
hastily
from
the
proceeded
the
same
day
to
the
suburbs
of
the
capital
the
senate
and
the
people
were
filled
with
great
fear
as
they
thought
of
the
denunciations
against
tiberius
which
they
had
often
uttered
and
of
the
many
surprises
his
speech
had
had
in
store
for
them
temporarily
their
alarm
and
dejection
prevented
them
from
saying
a
word
or
transacting
any
business
next
day
they
assembled
again
praised
gaius
unstintedly
as
a
most
sincere
and
pious
ruler
and
thanked
him
profusely
that
they
had
not
perished
like
others
accordingly
they
voted
annually
to
sacrifice
cattle
to
the
spirit
of
kindness
that
animated
him
both
on
the
anniversary
of
the
day
he
had
read
this
matter
just
mentioned
and
on
those
belonging
to
the
palatium
on
such
occasions
his
image
in
gold
was
to
be
conducted
to
the
capitol
and
hymns
sung
in
its
honor
by
the
boys
of
noblest
birth
they
granted
him
also
the
right
to
celebrate
a
lesser
triumph
as
though
he
had
defeated
some
enemies
this
was
what
they
voted
at
that
meeting
later
they
added
to
it
extensively
on
almost
every
pretext
gaius
took
no
heed
of
the
celebration
mentioned
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
no
great
thing
to
drive
a
horse
on
land
but
he
had
a
desire
to
ride
horseback
through
the
sea
in
a
way
by
bridging
over
the
water
between
puteoli
and
bauli
this
locality
is
opposite
the
city
stades
distant
boats
for
the
bridge
were
partly
brought
together
and
partly
built
new
for
the
purpose
for
the
number
it
had
proved
possible
to
collect
in
a
brief
space
of
time
was
insufficient
although
all
feasible
vessels
had
been
gathered
and
it
was
principally
this
fact
that
caused
a
serious
famine
in
italy
and
rome
in
joining
these
boats
not
merely
a
passageway
was
constructed
but
resting
places
and
waiting
rooms
were
built
along
in
it
and
these
had
running
water
fit
for
drinking
when
it
was
ready
he
put
on
the
breastplate
of
alexander
or
so
he
said
and
over
it
a
purple
silk
chlamys
containing
much
gold
and
many
precious
stones
from
india
he
furthermore
girt
on
a
sword
took
a
shield
and
donned
a
garland
of
oak
leaves
next
he
offered
sacrifice
to
neptune
and
some
other
gods
and
to
envy
in
order
he
said
that
no
jealousy
might
attend
him
and
entered
the
passage
from
the
end
at
bauli
taking
with
him
great
numbers
of
armed
horsemen
and
foot
soldiers
and
he
made
a
fierce
dash
into
the
city
as
if
he
were
after
some
enemies
there
he
rested
the
following
day
as
though
seeking
respite
from
battle
and
wearing
a
tunic
he
returned
on
a
chariot
over
the
same
bridge
he
was
drawn
by
that
were
most
competent
to
gain
victories
a
long
train
of
what
was
apparently
spoils
accompanied
him
among
them
darius
one
of
the
arsacidæ
belonging
to
the
group
of
parthians
then
serving
as
hostages
his
friends
and
associates
in
beflowered
robes
followed
him
on
vehicles
as
did
the
army
and
the
rest
of
the
throng
which
was
decked
out
according
to
individual
taste
of
course
in
the
midst
of
such
a
campaign
and
after
so
magnificent
a
victory
he
had
to
deliver
a
bit
of
an
harangue
so
he
ascended
a
platform
which
had
likewise
been
erected
at
about
the
center
of
the
bridge
first
he
extolled
himself
as
one
who
had
undertaken
a
great
enterprise
next
he
praised
the
soldiers
as
men
exhausted
by
the
dangers
they
had
faced
adding
the
significant
statement
that
they
had
traversed
the
sea
on
foot
for
this
gallantry
he
gave
them
money
and
afterward
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
all
through
the
night
they
enjoyed
a
banquet
he
on
the
bridge
as
though
some
island
and
they
at
anchor
on
other
boats
light
in
abundance
shone
upon
them
from
the
place
itself
and
abundant
light
besides
from
the
mountains
for
since
the
place
was
fire
was
exhibited
from
all
sides
as
might
be
done
in
a
theatre
so
that
no
one
could
notice
the
darkness
it
was
his
wish
to
make
the
night
day
as
he
had
made
the
sea
land
when
he
had
become
full
to
excess
of
food
and
strong
drink
he
threw
numbers
of
his
companions
off
the
bridge
into
the
sea
and
sank
many
of
the
rest
by
making
a
circuitous
attack
upon
them
in
boats
that
had
rams
some
perished
but
the
majority
though
drunk
managed
to
save
themselves
the
reason
was
that
the
sea
showed
itself
extremely
smooth
and
tranquil
both
while
the
bridge
was
being
put
together
and
while
the
other
events
were
taking
place
this
too
caused
the
emperor
some
elation
and
he
said
that
even
neptune
was
afraid
of
him
as
for
darius
and
xerxes
he
made
all
manner
of
fun
of
them
inasmuch
as
he
had
bridged
over
a
far
vaster
expanse
of
sea
than
they
the
final
episode
in
the
career
of
that
bridge
which
i
shall
now
relate
proved
another
source
of
death
to
many
inasmuch
as
the
emperor
had
exhausted
his
revenues
in
the
construction
he
fell
to
plotting
against
many
more
persons
because
of
their
property
he
presided
at
trials
both
privately
and
in
company
with
the
entire
senate
that
body
also
tried
some
cases
by
itself
yet
it
had
not
full
powers
and
there
were
many
appeals
from
its
decisions
the
decisions
of
the
senate
were
merely
made
public
but
when
any
men
were
condemned
by
gaius
their
names
were
bulletined
as
though
he
feared
they
might
not
learn
their
fate
these
met
their
punishment
some
in
prison
and
others
by
being
hurled
from
the
capitoline
still
others
killed
themselves
beforehand
there
was
no
safety
even
for
such
as
left
the
country
but
many
of
them
too
lost
their
lives
either
on
the
road
or
while
in
banishment
it
is
not
worth
while
to
burden
my
readers
unduly
by
going
into
the
details
of
most
of
these
cases
but
i
may
stop
to
notice
calvisius
sabinus
one
of
the
foremost
men
in
the
senate
he
had
recently
come
from
governing
pannonia
and
he
and
his
wife
cornelia
were
both
indicted
the
charge
against
her
was
that
she
had
visited
some
military
posts
and
had
watched
some
soldiers
practicing
these
two
did
not
stand
trial
but
despatched
themselves
before
the
time
set
the
same
is
to
be
recorded
of
titius
rufus
against
whom
a
complaint
was
lodged
that
he
had
said
the
senate
had
one
thing
in
their
minds
but
uttered
something
different
also
one
junius
priscus
a
prætor
was
accused
on
various
charges
but
his
death
was
really
due
to
the
supposition
that
he
was
wealthy
gaius
on
learning
that
he
possessed
nothing
worth
causing
his
death
for
made
this
remarkable
statement
he
fooled
me
and
perished
uselessly
when
he
might
as
well
have
lived
among
these
men
put
on
trial
at
this
time
domitius
afer
encountered
danger
from
an
unexpected
source
and
secured
his
preservation
in
a
still
more
remarkable
way
gaius
was
incensed
against
him
if
for
no
other
reason
because
in
the
reign
of
tiberius
he
had
accused
a
woman
who
was
related
to
the
emperor
mother
agrippina
later
the
woman
had
met
afer
and
as
she
saw
that
out
of
embarrassment
he
stood
aside
from
her
path
she
called
to
him
and
said
referring
to
the
matter
never
mind
domitius
it
was
you
but
agamemnon
that
caused
me
these
troubles
just
about
this
time
afer
had
set
up
an
image
of
the
emperor
and
had
placed
upon
it
an
inscription
showing
that
gaius
in
his
year
was
already
consul
for
the
second
time
this
vexed
the
latter
who
felt
that
undue
notice
was
being
given
to
his
youth
and
his
transgression
of
the
law
so
for
this
action
for
which
afer
had
looked
to
be
honored
he
brought
him
before
the
senate
and
read
a
long
speech
against
him
gaius
always
maintained
that
he
surpassed
all
living
orators
and
knowing
that
his
adversary
was
an
extremely
gifted
speaker
he
strove
on
this
occasion
to
excel
him
he
would
certainly
have
put
afer
to
death
if
the
latter
had
entered
into
the
least
competition
with
him
as
it
was
the
man
made
no
answer
or
defence
but
pretended
to
be
astonished
and
overcome
by
the
cleverness
of
gaius
and
repeating
the
accusation
point
by
point
he
praised
it
as
though
he
were
some
listener
and
not
on
trial
when
opportunity
was
given
him
to
speak
he
took
to
supplicating
and
bewailing
his
lot
finally
he
threw
himself
on
the
earth
and
lying
there
prostrate
he
besought
his
accuser
apparently
fearing
him
as
an
orator
rather
than
as
cæsar
in
this
way
the
latter
when
he
saw
and
heard
what
i
have
described
was
melted
for
he
thought
that
he
had
really
overwhelmed
domitius
by
the
eloquence
of
his
address
for
this
reason
then
and
on
account
of
callistus
the
freedman
whom
he
was
wont
to
honor
and
whose
favor
domitius
had
courted
he
ceased
his
anger
and
when
callistus
later
blamed
him
for
having
accused
the
man
in
the
first
place
the
emperor
answered
it
would
not
have
been
right
for
me
to
hide
such
a
speech
so
domitius
was
saved
by
being
convicted
of
no
longer
being
a
skillful
speaker
on
the
other
hand
lucius
annæus
seneca
who
was
superior
in
wisdom
to
all
the
romans
of
his
day
and
to
many
other
great
men
came
very
near
being
ruined
though
he
had
done
no
wrong
and
there
was
no
suspicion
of
such
a
thing
but
just
because
he
pled
a
case
well
in
the
senate
while
his
sovereign
was
present
gaius
ordered
him
to
be
put
to
death
but
let
him
go
because
he
believed
what
one
of
his
female
associates
said
that
seneca
had
a
bad
case
of
consumption
and
would
die
before
a
great
while
directly
he
appointed
domitius
consul
and
removed
those
who
held
the
office
at
the
time
this
he
did
because
they
had
not
proclaimed
a
thanksgiving
on
the
occasion
of
his
birthday
the
prætors
had
held
a
and
had
slaughtered
some
beasts
but
that
happened
every
year
whereas
they
had
celebrated
a
festival
to
commemorate
the
victory
of
augustus
over
antony
in
order
to
find
an
accusation
against
them
he
chose
to
figure
as
a
descendant
of
antony
rather
than
of
augustus
he
had
beforehand
told
those
who
shared
his
secrets
that
whichever
the
consuls
did
they
would
certainly
get
into
trouble
whether
they
offered
sacrifice
as
a
mark
of
joy
over
antony
disaster
or
whether
they
went
without
sacrificing
on
such
an
occasion
as
the
victory
of
augustus
it
was
for
these
reasons
then
that
he
summarily
dismissed
these
officials
and
broke
to
pieces
their
fasces
one
of
them
took
it
so
much
to
heart
that
he
killed
himself
domitius
was
chosen
as
the
emperor
colleague
nominally
by
the
people
but
actually
by
gaius
himself
the
latter
had
to
be
sure
restored
the
elections
to
the
populace
but
they
had
become
rather
lax
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
because
for
a
long
time
now
they
had
enjoyed
none
of
the
privileges
of
freemen
and
as
a
rule
no
more
presented
themselves
than
were
needed
to
fill
vacant
places
or
if
ever
there
was
an
excessive
number
the
outcome
had
been
all
arranged
among
themselves
thus
the
appearance
of
a
democracy
was
preserved
but
none
of
the
proper
results
was
secured
and
this
led
gaius
himself
to
abolish
the
elections
again
after
this
things
went
on
precisely
as
in
the
reign
of
tiberius
sometimes
fifteen
prætors
were
chosen
and
again
one
more
or
less
as
it
might
happen
such
was
the
action
he
took
regarding
the
elections
in
general
he
maintained
a
malignant
and
suspicious
attitude
toward
quite
everything
that
went
on
as
witness
his
banishing
carrina
secundus
the
orator
because
the
latter
had
delivered
in
a
gymnasium
a
speech
against
tyrants
also
when
lucius
piso
son
of
plancina
and
gnaeus
piso
chanced
to
become
governor
of
africa
the
emperor
feared
that
pride
might
lead
him
to
revolt
particularly
since
he
was
to
have
a
large
force
made
up
of
both
citizens
and
foreigners
hence
the
province
was
divided
in
two
and
the
military
force
together
with
the
nomads
in
the
immediate
vicinity
was
assigned
to
a
different
official
that
arrangement
lasts
to
this
day
gaius
had
now
spent
practically
all
the
money
in
rome
and
the
rest
of
italy
gathered
from
every
source
from
which
he
could
in
any
way
get
it
and
as
no
resource
that
was
of
any
value
or
practicable
could
be
found
there
his
expenses
became
a
source
of
great
annoyance
to
him
therefore
he
set
out
for
gaul
declaring
hostilities
against
the
celtae
on
the
ground
that
they
were
showing
some
uneasiness
but
in
reality
his
purpose
was
to
get
money
from
that
region
and
spain
where
wealth
was
also
abundant
however
he
did
not
make
an
outright
declaration
of
his
destination
but
went
first
to
one
of
the
suburbs
and
then
suddenly
started
on
his
journey
taking
with
him
many
dancers
gladiators
horses
women
and
the
rest
of
the
rout
when
he
reached
the
section
he
had
in
view
he
did
no
damage
to
any
of
the
enemy
as
soon
as
he
had
proceeded
a
short
distance
beyond
the
rhine
he
turned
back
and
next
he
started
apparently
to
conduct
a
campaign
against
britain
but
turned
back
from
the
ocean
edge
showing
no
little
vexation
at
his
lieutenants
because
they
won
some
slight
success
among
the
subject
peoples
however
and
among
the
allies
and
the
citizens
he
wrought
the
greatest
imaginable
havoc
in
the
first
place
he
despoiled
property
holders
on
any
and
every
excuse
and
second
individuals
and
cities
brought
him
voluntarily
large
gifts
he
kept
on
murdering
victims
alleging
that
some
were
rebelling
and
others
conspiring
the
general
complaint
against
them
all
was
that
they
were
rich
the
fact
that
he
attended
to
the
selling
of
their
possessions
in
person
enabled
him
to
obtain
far
greater
sums
than
would
otherwise
have
been
the
case
everybody
was
compelled
to
buy
them
under
all
sorts
of
conditions
and
for
much
more
than
their
value
for
the
reasons
i
have
mentioned
accordingly
he
sent
also
for
the
finest
and
most
precious
heirlooms
of
the
government
and
auctioned
them
off
selling
with
them
the
fame
of
the
persons
who
had
once
used
them
he
would
make
some
comment
on
each
one
such
as
this
belonged
to
my
father
this
to
my
mother
this
to
my
grandfather
this
to
my
this
egyptian
piece
belonged
to
antony
became
a
prize
of
augustus
meantime
he
incidentally
showed
the
necessity
of
selling
them
so
that
no
one
dared
to
appear
to
be
indigent
and
he
sold
with
each
article
some
valuable
association
in
spite
of
all
this
he
did
not
secure
any
surplus
he
kept
up
his
expenditures
both
for
the
objects
that
regularly
interested
him
producing
some
spectacles
at
lugdunum
and
also
for
the
army
for
the
number
of
soldiers
he
had
gathered
amounted
to
twenty
myriads
or
as
some
say
to
myriads
seven
times
was
he
named
imperator
by
them
just
as
pleased
him
though
he
had
won
no
battle
and
slain
no
enemy
to
be
sure
he
did
once
by
a
ruse
seize
and
make
prisoners
a
few
of
the
latter
but
it
was
his
own
people
whom
he
wasted
most
striking
some
of
them
down
individually
and
butchering
others
once
he
saw
a
crowd
either
of
prisoners
or
some
other
persons
and
gave
orders
in
the
cant
phrase
that
they
should
all
be
slain
from
baldhead
to
baldhead
another
time
he
was
playing
dice
and
finding
that
he
had
no
money
called
for
the
census
of
the
gauls
and
ordered
the
wealthiest
of
them
to
be
put
to
death
then
he
returned
to
his
fellow
gamblers
and
said
here
you
are
playing
for
a
few
denarii
while
i
have
collected
nearly
fifteen
thousand
myriads
so
these
men
perished
without
consideration
indeed
one
of
them
julius
sacerdos
who
was
fairly
well
off
but
not
so
extremely
wealthy
as
naturally
to
become
the
object
of
attack
nevertheless
fell
a
victim
because
of
a
similarity
of
names
this
shows
how
carelessly
everything
went
others
who
perished
i
need
not
cite
by
name
simply
mentioning
enough
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
my
record
one
then
that
he
killed
was
gastulicus
lentulus
a
man
of
good
reputation
in
every
way
who
had
been
governor
of
germany
for
ten
years
his
death
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
soldiers
liked
him
another
that
he
murdered
was
lepidus
that
lover
and
favorite
of
his
husband
of
drusilla
the
man
who
together
with
gaius
had
maintained
criminal
relations
with
the
emperor
other
sisters
agrippina
and
julia
the
man
whom
he
had
permitted
to
stand
for
office
five
years
earlier
than
the
laws
allowed
whom
he
also
declared
he
should
leave
to
succeed
him
as
emperor
to
celebrate
the
event
he
gave
the
soldiers
money
as
though
he
had
worsted
some
hostile
force
and
sent
three
daggers
to
mars
the
avenger
in
rome
his
sisters
for
their
connection
with
lepidus
he
deported
to
the
portian
islands
having
first
written
to
the
senate
a
great
deal
of
outrageous
and
brutal
comment
upon
them
agrippina
was
given
the
victim
bones
in
a
jar
and
ordered
to
keep
it
in
her
bosom
throughout
the
entire
journey
and
bring
it
back
to
rome
again
also
since
many
honors
had
been
voted
to
these
women
on
the
account
the
emperor
forbade
any
distinction
being
awarded
to
any
of
his
relatives
again
he
sent
to
the
senate
at
the
time
a
report
of
the
matter
as
if
he
had
escaped
some
great
plot
for
he
was
always
pretending
to
be
in
danger
and
to
be
leading
a
miserable
existence
the
senators
on
being
apprised
of
the
facts
passed
several
complimentary
votes
and
granted
him
a
lesser
triumph
they
sent
envoys
to
announce
this
some
of
whom
were
chosen
by
lot
but
claudius
by
election
that
also
displeased
the
emperor
to
such
an
extent
that
he
again
forbade
anything
approaching
praise
or
honor
being
given
to
his
relatives
he
felt
too
that
he
had
not
been
honored
as
he
deserved
and
indeed
he
never
made
any
account
of
the
honors
granted
him
it
irritated
him
to
have
small
distinctions
voted
since
that
implied
a
slight
and
greater
distinctions
irritated
him
because
then
he
was
deprived
of
the
possibility
of
winning
still
higher
prizes
he
did
not
wish
it
to
seem
that
anything
that
brought
him
honors
was
in
the
senators
power
that
would
make
them
stronger
than
he
nor
again
that
they
should
have
the
right
to
grant
such
a
thing
to
him
as
if
they
had
power
and
he
was
inferior
to
them
for
this
reason
he
ofttimes
found
fault
with
various
gifts
on
the
ground
that
they
did
not
increase
his
splendor
but
rather
diminished
his
power
being
of
this
mind
he
used
to
become
angry
at
those
who
did
him
honor
if
in
any
case
it
seemed
that
they
had
voted
him
less
than
he
deserved
so
capricious
was
he
that
no
one
could
easily
suit
him
accordingly
for
the
reasons
mentioned
he
would
not
receive
all
of
those
ambassadors
affecting
to
mistrust
that
they
were
spies
but
chose
out
a
few
and
sent
the
rest
back
before
they
reached
gaul
those
that
he
admitted
to
his
presence
were
not
accorded
any
august
reception
indeed
he
would
have
killed
claudius
had
he
not
entertained
a
contempt
for
him
since
the
latter
partly
by
nature
and
partly
with
intention
gave
the
impression
of
great
stupidity
others
were
again
sent
more
in
number
for
he
had
complained
among
other
points
of
the
smallness
of
the
first
embassy
and
they
made
the
announcement
that
many
marks
of
distinction
had
been
voted
to
him
these
he
received
gladly
even
going
out
to
meet
them
for
which
action
he
received
fresh
honors
at
their
hands
this
however
was
somewhat
later
at
the
time
under
discussion
gaius
divorced
paulina
on
the
pretext
that
she
was
barren
but
really
because
he
had
had
enough
of
her
and
married
milonia
cæsonia
she
had
formerly
been
his
mistress
but
now
as
she
was
pregnant
he
chose
to
make
her
his
wife
and
have
her
bear
him
a
child
a
month
later
the
people
of
rome
were
disturbed
by
this
behavior
and
were
still
further
disturbed
because
a
number
of
trials
were
hanging
over
their
heads
as
a
result
of
the
friendship
they
had
shown
for
his
sisters
and
for
the
men
who
had
been
murdered
even
some
ædiles
and
prætors
were
compelled
to
resign
their
offices
and
stand
meantime
they
also
suffered
from
the
excessive
heat
this
grew
so
extremely
severe
that
curtains
were
stretched
across
the
among
the
men
exiled
at
this
time
ofonius
tigillinus
was
banished
on
the
charge
of
having
had
a
with
agrippina
all
this
however
did
not
distress
the
people
so
much
as
their
expectation
that
the
cruelty
and
licentiousness
of
gaius
would
go
to
still
greater
lengths
they
were
particularly
troubled
on
ascertaining
that
king
agrippa
and
king
antiochus
were
with
him
like
two
as
a
consequence
while
he
was
consul
for
the
third
time
no
tribune
nor
prætor
dared
to
convene
the
senate
for
he
had
no
colleague
though
this
as
some
think
was
not
intentional
but
the
regular
appointee
died
and
no
one
else
in
so
short
a
period
of
time
as
was
available
could
be
brought
forward
in
the
comitia
to
fill
his
place
moreover
the
prætors
who
attend
to
the
affairs
of
the
consuls
whenever
the
latter
are
out
of
town
ought
to
have
administered
all
business
pending
but
at
this
period
in
order
not
to
appear
to
have
acted
for
the
emperor
they
performed
none
of
their
duties
the
senators
in
a
body
ascended
the
capitoline
offered
their
sacrifices
and
did
obeisance
to
the
chair
of
gaius
located
in
the
temple
furthermore
according
to
a
custom
prevailing
in
the
time
of
augustus
they
deposited
money
making
a
show
of
giving
it
to
the
emperor
himself
their
practice
was
similar
also
in
the
following
year
at
the
time
of
the
events
just
narrated
they
came
together
in
the
after
these
proceedings
without
any
person
having
convened
them
but
accomplished
nothing
wasting
the
whole
day
in
laudations
of
gaius
and
prayers
in
his
behalf
since
they
had
no
love
for
him
nor
any
wish
that
he
should
survive
they
simulated
both
these
feelings
to
all
the
greater
extent
as
if
hoping
in
this
way
to
disguise
their
real
sentiments
on
the
third
day
devoted
to
prayers
they
came
together
in
response
to
an
announcement
of
a
meeting
made
by
all
the
prætors
in
a
written
notice
still
they
transacted
no
business
on
this
day
nor
again
on
the
next
until
on
the
twelfth
day
word
was
brought
that
gaius
had
resigned
his
office
then
at
last
the
men
who
had
been
elected
for
subsequent
service
succeeded
to
the
position
and
administered
the
business
that
fell
to
them
it
was
voted
among
other
measures
that
the
same
honors
should
be
given
to
the
birthdays
of
tiberius
and
of
drusilla
as
to
that
of
augustus
the
actor
folk
also
celebrated
a
festival
provided
a
spectacle
and
set
up
and
dedicated
images
of
gaius
and
this
was
in
accordance
with
a
letter
of
gaius
whenever
he
wished
any
business
brought
up
he
communicated
in
writing
a
small
portion
of
it
to
all
the
senators
but
most
of
it
to
the
consuls
and
then
sometimes
ordered
this
to
be
read
in
the
so
much
for
the
transactions
of
the
senate
meanwhile
gaius
sent
for
ptolemæus
the
son
of
juba
and
on
ascertaining
that
he
was
wealthy
put
him
to
death
and
a
number
of
others
with
him
also
when
he
reached
the
ocean
and
was
to
all
appearances
about
to
conduct
a
campaign
in
britain
and
had
drawn
up
all
the
soldiers
on
the
beach
he
embarked
on
the
triremes
but
after
putting
out
a
little
from
the
land
he
sailed
back
again
next
he
took
his
seat
on
a
high
platform
and
gave
his
soldiers
the
watchword
as
if
for
battle
while
the
trumpeters
urged
them
on
all
of
a
sudden
however
he
ordered
them
to
gather
the
shells
having
secured
these
spoils
you
see
he
needed
booty
for
the
celebration
of
his
triumph
he
became
immensely
elated
assuming
that
he
had
enslaved
the
ocean
itself
and
he
gave
his
soldiers
many
presents
the
shells
he
took
back
to
rome
for
the
purpose
of
exhibiting
the
spoils
to
the
people
there
as
well
the
senate
did
not
see
how
it
could
remain
inactive
in
the
face
of
this
procedure
inasmuch
as
it
learned
he
was
in
an
exalted
frame
of
mind
nor
yet
again
how
it
could
praise
him
for
when
anybody
bestows
great
praise
or
extraordinary
honors
for
a
small
success
or
none
at
all
that
person
becomes
suspected
of
making
a
mock
and
jest
of
the
affair
still
for
all
that
when
gaius
entered
the
city
he
came
very
near
devoting
the
whole
senate
to
destruction
because
it
had
not
voted
him
divine
honors
but
he
contented
himself
with
assembling
the
populace
upon
whom
he
showered
from
a
raised
position
quantities
of
silver
and
gold
many
perished
in
the
effort
to
seize
it
for
as
some
say
he
had
mixed
small
in
with
the
coin
as
a
result
of
his
adulteries
he
repeatedly
received
the
titles
of
imperator
and
germanicus
and
britannicus
no
less
than
if
he
had
subdued
gaul
and
britain
entire
since
this
was
his
manner
of
life
he
was
destined
inevitably
to
be
plotted
against
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
an
attack
and
arrested
anicius
cerealius
and
his
son
sextus
papinius
whom
he
put
to
the
torture
and
inasmuch
as
the
former
would
not
utter
a
word
he
persuaded
papinius
by
promising
him
safety
and
immunity
to
denounce
certain
persons
whether
truly
or
falsely
he
then
straightway
put
to
death
both
cerealius
and
the
rest
before
his
very
eyes
there
was
a
betilienus
bassus
whom
he
had
ordered
killed
and
he
compelled
capito
the
man
father
to
be
present
at
his
execution
though
capito
was
not
guilty
of
any
crime
and
had
received
no
court
summons
when
the
father
enquired
if
he
would
allow
him
to
shut
his
eyes
gaius
ordered
him
to
be
slain
likewise
he
finding
himself
in
danger
pretended
to
have
been
one
of
the
plotters
and
promised
that
he
would
disclose
the
names
of
all
the
rest
and
he
named
the
companions
of
gaius
and
those
who
abetted
his
licentiousness
and
cruelty
he
would
have
brought
destruction
upon
many
persons
had
he
not
by
laying
further
information
against
the
prefects
and
callistus
and
cæsonia
aroused
distrust
so
he
was
put
to
death
but
this
very
act
paved
the
way
for
the
ruin
of
gaius
for
the
emperor
privately
summoned
the
prefects
and
callistus
and
said
to
them
i
am
but
one
and
you
are
three
and
i
am
defenceless
whereas
you
are
armed
hence
if
you
hate
and
desire
to
kill
me
slay
me
at
once
the
general
consequences
were
that
he
came
to
regard
himself
as
an
object
of
hatred
and
believing
that
they
were
vexed
at
his
behavior
he
harbored
suspicion
against
them
and
wore
a
sword
at
his
side
when
in
the
city
and
to
forestall
any
harmony
of
action
on
their
part
he
attempted
to
embroil
them
one
with
another
by
pretending
to
make
a
confidant
of
each
one
separately
and
talking
to
him
about
the
rest
until
they
obtained
a
notion
of
his
designs
and
left
him
a
prey
to
the
conspirators
the
same
emperor
ordered
the
senate
to
convene
and
affected
to
grant
its
members
amnesty
saying
that
there
were
only
a
very
few
against
whom
he
still
retained
his
anger
this
expression
doubled
the
anxiety
of
each
one
of
them
for
everybody
was
thinking
of
himself
another
person
named
protogenes
assisted
the
emperor
in
all
his
projects
and
carried
continually
on
his
person
two
books
of
which
he
called
the
one
sword
and
the
other
dagger
this
protogenes
once
entered
the
senate
as
if
on
some
indifferent
business
and
when
all
as
was
to
be
expected
saluted
and
greeted
him
he
darted
a
kind
of
sinister
glance
at
scribonius
proculus
and
said
do
you
too
greet
me
though
you
hate
the
emperor
so
on
hearing
this
all
those
present
surrounded
their
fellow
senator
and
tore
him
to
pieces
and
voted
some
festivals
to
gains
as
also
that
the
emperor
should
have
a
high
platform
in
the
to
prevent
any
one
approaching
him
besides
enjoying
the
use
of
a
military
guard
even
there
they
resolved
further
that
his
statues
should
be
guarded
pleased
at
this
gaius
laid
aside
his
anger
toward
them
and
with
a
buoyant
spirit
promised
them
some
money
pomponius
who
was
said
to
have
plotted
against
him
he
released
inasmuch
as
he
had
been
betrayed
by
a
friend
and
as
the
man
mistress
when
tortured
would
not
utter
a
word
he
did
her
no
further
harm
and
even
gave
her
an
honorary
gift
of
money
gaius
was
praised
for
this
partly
through
fear
and
partly
sincerely
and
as
some
called
him
hero
and
others
god
he
fairly
went
out
of
his
head
even
before
this
he
was
in
the
habit
of
demanding
that
he
be
given
superhuman
regard
and
said
that
he
had
intercourse
with
the
moon
goddess
and
was
crowned
by
victory
he
also
pretended
to
be
jupiter
and
took
this
as
a
pretext
for
having
carnal
knowledge
of
various
women
especially
his
sisters
again
he
would
often
figure
as
neptune
because
he
had
bridged
so
great
an
expanse
of
sea
or
perhaps
as
juno
and
diana
and
venus
he
would
impersonate
hercules
bacchus
apollo
and
all
the
other
divinities
not
merely
males
but
also
females
as
fast
as
he
changed
the
names
he
would
assume
all
the
rest
of
the
attributes
that
belonged
to
them
so
that
he
might
seem
to
resemble
them
now
he
would
be
seen
in
feminine
guise
holding
a
and
thyrsus
again
with
masculine
trappings
he
would
carry
a
club
and
or
perhaps
a
helmet
and
shield
he
would
make
up
first
with
smooth
chin
and
later
on
as
a
bearded
man
sometimes
he
wielded
a
trident
and
on
other
occasions
he
brandished
the
thunderbolt
he
would
array
himself
like
a
maiden
equipped
for
hunting
or
war
and
after
a
brief
interval
would
come
forth
as
a
woman
thus
he
could
make
changes
with
careful
attention
to
details
by
the
variety
of
his
dress
and
by
what
he
attached
to
or
threw
over
it
and
he
was
anxious
to
appear
to
be
anything
rather
than
a
human
being
and
an
emperor
once
a
certain
gaul
espying
him
on
a
high
platform
transacting
business
in
the
guise
of
jupiter
laughed
aloud
gaius
called
to
him
and
asked
what
do
i
seem
to
you
to
be
and
the
other
answered
i
shall
tell
his
exact
words
a
big
pack
of
foolishness
yet
the
man
met
no
dire
fate
for
he
was
a
shoemaker
persons
of
such
rank
as
gaius
can
bear
the
frankness
of
the
common
herd
more
easily
than
that
of
those
who
hold
high
now
this
was
the
attire
he
would
assume
whenever
he
pretended
to
be
some
god
and
there
were
suitable
supplications
prayers
and
sacrifices
offered
to
it
otherwise
he
usually
appeared
in
public
in
silk
and
triumphal
dress
very
few
were
those
whom
he
would
kiss
to
most
of
the
senators
even
he
extended
his
hand
or
foot
for
homage
consequently
the
men
who
were
kissed
by
him
thanked
him
for
it
even
in
the
senate
though
all
might
see
him
kissing
dancers
every
day
and
these
divine
honors
paid
him
came
not
only
from
the
many
accustomed
at
all
times
to
flatter
but
from
those
who
really
pretended
to
be
something
take
the
case
of
lucius
vitellius
not
of
low
birth
nor
without
sense
a
man
who
on
the
contrary
had
become
famous
by
his
governorship
of
syria
in
addition
to
his
other
brilliant
exploits
as
an
official
he
spoiled
a
plot
of
artabanus
in
that
region
he
encountered
the
latter
who
had
suffered
no
punishment
for
armenia
already
close
to
the
euphrates
and
terrified
him
by
his
sudden
appearance
he
then
induced
him
to
come
to
a
conference
and
finally
compelled
him
to
sacrifice
to
the
images
of
augustus
and
gaius
furthermore
he
made
a
peace
with
him
that
was
advantageous
for
the
romans
and
secured
his
children
as
hostages
this
vitellius
then
was
summoned
by
gaius
to
be
put
to
death
the
complaint
against
him
was
the
same
as
the
parthians
had
against
their
king
whom
they
expelled
jealousy
made
him
the
object
of
hatred
and
fear
the
object
of
plots
for
every
power
stronger
than
himself
gaius
entertained
hatred
and
he
was
suspicious
of
whatever
was
successful
feeling
sure
that
it
would
ultimately
attack
him
but
vitellius
saved
his
life
by
somehow
presenting
himself
in
such
a
way
as
to
appear
of
less
importance
than
his
reputation
would
lead
one
to
expect
he
fell
at
the
feet
shedding
tears
of
lamentation
all
the
time
saluting
him
frequently
as
divine
and
paying
him
worship
at
last
he
vowed
that
should
he
survive
he
would
sacrifice
to
gaius
by
this
behavior
he
so
mollified
the
offended
monarch
and
won
his
that
he
not
only
managed
to
survive
but
came
to
be
regarded
as
one
of
his
lord
most
intimate
friends
on
one
occasion
gaius
declared
he
was
enjoying
converse
with
the
moon
goddess
and
when
he
asked
vitellius
if
he
could
see
the
goddess
with
him
the
other
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
as
if
overcome
by
amazement
in
a
half
whisper
he
answered
only
you
gods
master
may
behold
one
another
so
vitellius
from
these
beginnings
later
came
to
surpass
all
others
in
adulation
gaius
gave
orders
that
in
miletus
of
the
province
of
asia
a
certain
tract
of
land
should
be
set
apart
for
his
worship
his
avowed
reason
for
choosing
this
city
was
that
diana
had
preempted
ephesus
augustus
pergamum
and
tiberius
smyrna
the
truth
of
the
matter
however
was
that
he
had
conceived
a
desire
to
appropriate
to
his
own
use
the
large
and
extremely
beautiful
temple
which
the
milesians
were
building
to
apollo
thereupon
he
went
to
still
greater
lengths
and
built
actually
in
rome
itself
one
temple
of
his
own
that
was
accorded
him
by
vote
of
the
senate
and
another
at
his
private
expense
on
the
capitoline
he
also
planned
a
kind
of
dwelling
on
the
capitol
in
order
as
he
said
that
he
might
live
in
the
same
house
with
jupiter
however
he
disdained
taking
second
place
in
this
union
of
households
and
found
fault
with
the
god
for
occupying
the
capitol
before
him
accordingly
he
hastened
to
construct
another
temple
on
the
palatine
and
by
way
of
a
statue
for
it
thought
he
should
like
to
change
that
of
olympian
jove
so
as
to
resemble
himself
this
he
found
impossible
for
the
boat
built
to
bring
it
was
shattered
by
thunderbolts
and
loud
laughter
was
plainly
heard
as
often
as
any
persons
approached
the
pedestal
to
take
hold
of
it
so
after
hurling
threats
at
the
obdurate
image
he
set
up
a
new
one
of
the
temple
of
the
dioscuri
in
the
roman
forum
he
cut
in
two
and
made
through
it
an
approach
to
the
palatine
running
right
between
the
statues
to
the
end
these
were
at
all
events
his
words
that
he
might
have
the
dioscuri
for
assuming
the
name
of
dialius
he
attached
cæsonia
his
wife
claudius
and
other
persons
who
were
very
wealthy
to
his
service
as
priests
receiving
from
each
one
two
hundred
and
fifty
myriads
for
this
honor
he
also
consecrated
himself
to
his
own
service
and
appointed
his
horse
a
dainty
and
expensive
birds
were
daily
sacrificed
to
him
he
had
a
contrivance
by
which
he
defied
the
thunder
with
answering
peals
and
could
send
return
flashes
when
it
lightened
likewise
whenever
a
bolt
fell
he
would
in
turn
hurl
a
javelin
at
a
rock
repeating
each
time
the
words
of
homer
either
lift
me
or
i
will
thee
when
thirty
days
after
her
marriage
cæsonia
brought
forth
a
little
daughter
he
pretended
that
this
too
had
come
about
through
supernatural
means
and
gave
himself
airs
on
the
fact
that
in
so
few
days
after
becoming
a
husband
he
was
a
father
he
gave
the
child
the
name
of
drusilla
and
taking
her
up
to
the
capitol
placed
her
on
the
knees
of
jupiter
with
the
implication
that
she
was
his
child
and
put
her
in
charge
of
minerva
to
be
suckled
this
god
then
this
jupiter
he
was
called
by
the
latter
name
so
much
that
it
even
found
its
way
into
documents
at
the
same
time
that
all
this
took
place
was
collecting
money
in
most
shameful
and
most
frightful
ways
one
may
to
be
sure
leave
out
of
account
the
wares
and
the
taverns
the
brothels
and
the
courts
the
artisans
and
the
slaves
and
other
such
sources
from
every
single
one
of
which
he
gathered
funds
but
how
can
one
escape
mentioning
the
rooms
set
apart
in
the
very
palace
and
the
wives
of
the
foremost
men
as
well
as
the
children
of
the
most
aristocratic
families
that
he
shut
up
in
these
rooms
and
foully
abused
sparing
absolutely
no
one
in
his
greed
for
such
victims
meeting
with
no
resistance
from
some
who
wished
to
avoid
showing
any
displeasure
but
seizing
others
quite
against
their
will
yet
these
proceedings
did
not
displease
the
mob
very
much
but
they
rather
delighted
with
him
in
his
licentiousness
and
in
the
fact
that
he
also
would
throw
himself
on
the
heap
of
gold
and
silver
collected
from
these
persons
and
roll
in
it
when
however
after
enacting
severe
laws
in
regard
to
the
taxes
he
inscribed
them
in
exceedingly
small
letters
on
a
tablet
which
he
then
hung
up
aloft
so
as
to
make
sure
that
it
should
be
read
as
little
as
possible
and
that
many
through
ignorance
of
what
was
bidden
or
forbidden
should
make
themselves
liable
to
the
penalties
thereof
the
people
straightway
ran
together
excitedly
into
the
hippodrome
and
raised
fierce
shouts
once
the
people
had
come
together
in
the
hippodrome
and
were
objecting
to
his
conduct
and
he
had
them
cut
down
by
the
soldiers
in
this
way
he
imposed
silence
upon
them
all
u
as
he
continued
to
show
insanity
in
every
way
a
plot
was
formed
against
him
by
cassius
chairea
and
cornelius
sabinus
though
they
were
holding
tribuneships
in
his
pretorian
guard
a
number
were
in
the
conspiracy
and
privy
to
what
was
being
done
among
whom
were
callistus
and
the
prefect
practically
all
of
his
courtiers
were
interested
both
in
their
own
behalf
and
for
the
common
good
any
who
did
not
take
part
in
the
conspiracy
still
refused
to
reveal
it
though
they
knew
of
it
and
were
glad
to
see
a
plot
formed
against
him
but
the
men
who
actually
killed
gaius
were
those
mentioned
it
is
worth
noting
besides
that
chairea
was
an
sort
of
man
and
had
a
private
cause
for
anger
gaius
was
in
the
habit
of
nicknaming
him
sissy
though
he
was
the
hardiest
of
men
and
whenever
it
came
the
turn
of
chairea
to
command
would
give
him
some
such
watchword
as
yearning
or
venus
again
an
oracle
had
a
short
time
before
warned
gaius
to
beware
of
cassius
the
former
supposing
that
it
had
reference
to
gaius
cassius
governor
of
asia
at
the
time
because
he
was
a
descendant
of
that
cassius
who
had
slain
cæsar
had
him
brought
as
a
prisoner
the
person
whose
future
conduct
the
divinity
was
really
indicating
to
the
emperor
however
was
this
cassius
chairea
likewise
a
certain
egyptian
apollonius
foretold
in
his
native
land
what
happened
to
him
for
this
speech
he
was
sent
to
rome
and
was
brought
before
the
emperor
the
day
on
which
the
latter
was
destined
to
die
his
punishment
was
postponed
till
a
little
later
and
in
this
way
his
life
was
saved
the
deed
was
done
as
follows
gaius
was
celebrating
a
festival
in
the
palace
and
was
attending
to
the
production
of
a
spectacle
in
the
course
of
this
he
was
himself
both
eating
and
drinking
and
was
feasting
the
rest
of
the
company
pomponius
secundus
consul
at
the
time
was
taking
his
fill
of
the
food
as
he
sat
by
the
emperor
feet
and
at
the
same
time
kept
continually
bending
over
to
shower
kisses
upon
them
gaius
himself
decided
that
he
wanted
to
dance
and
act
as
a
tragedian
the
followers
of
chairea
could
endure
it
no
longer
as
he
went
out
of
the
theatre
to
see
the
boys
of
most
noble
lineage
whom
he
had
imported
from
greece
and
ionia
to
sing
the
hymn
composed
in
his
honor
the
conspirators
wounded
him
then
intercepted
him
in
a
narrow
passage
and
killed
him
when
he
fell
to
the
ground
none
of
those
present
would
keep
his
hands
off
him
but
they
all
savagely
stabbed
the
lifeless
corpse
again
and
again
some
chewed
pieces
of
his
flesh
his
wife
and
daughter
were
immediately
slain
so
gaius
who
accomplished
all
these
exploits
in
three
years
nine
months
and
days
learned
by
actual
experience
that
he
was
not
a
god
now
he
was
openly
spurned
by
those
who
had
been
accustomed
to
do
him
reverence
even
when
absent
his
blood
was
spilled
by
persons
who
were
wont
to
speak
and
to
write
of
him
as
jove
and
god
his
statues
and
his
images
were
dragged
from
their
pedestals
for
the
people
in
particular
retained
a
lively
remembrance
of
the
distress
they
had
endured
all
the
soldiers
in
the
germanic
division
raised
an
outcry
and
their
remonstrance
extended
to
the
point
of
indulging
in
slaughter
those
who
stood
by
remembered
the
words
once
spoken
by
him
to
the
populace
how
i
wish
you
had
but
one
neck
and
made
it
plain
to
him
that
it
was
he
who
had
but
one
neck
whereas
they
had
many
hands
and
when
the
pretorian
guard
filled
with
consternation
began
running
about
and
demanding
who
had
slain
gaius
valerius
asiaticus
an
took
a
remarkable
mode
of
bringing
them
to
their
senses
in
that
he
climbed
up
to
a
conspicuous
place
and
cried
out
i
only
wish
i
had
killed
him
this
alarmed
them
so
that
they
stopped
their
outcry
all
such
persons
as
in
any
way
acknowledged
the
authority
of
the
senate
obeyed
their
oaths
and
became
once
more
while
the
overthrow
of
gaius
was
thus
being
accomplished
the
consuls
sentius
and
secundus
forthwith
transferred
the
funds
from
the
to
the
capitol
they
stationed
most
of
the
senators
and
plenty
of
soldiers
as
guards
over
it
to
prevent
any
plundering
being
done
by
the
populace
so
these
men
in
company
with
the
prefects
and
the
circle
of
sabinus
and
chairea
deliberated
as
to
what
should
be
done

of

city
and

the

on

capitol
where
many
diverse
opinions
were
uttered
some
favored
a
democracy
some
a
monarchy
some
were
for
choosing
this
man
and
others
that
therefore
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
and
the
whole
night
without
accomplishing
anything
meanwhile
some
soldiers
who
had
entered
the
palace
for
the
purpose
of
making
spoil
of
something
or
other
found
claudius
hidden
away
in
a
dark
corner
he
was
attending
gaius
when
the
latter
came
out
of
the
theatre
and
at
this
time
through
fear
of
the
confusion
had
crouched
down
out
of
the
way
at
first
the
men
thinking
that
he
was
some
one
else
and
perhaps
had
something
worth
taking
dragged
him
out
afterwards
on
recognizing
him
they
hailed
him
as
emperor
and
conducted
him
to
the
camp
then
in
company
with
their
comrades
they
delivered
to
him
the
entire
power
of
government
inasmuch
as
he
was
of
the
imperial
race
and
was
regarded
as
suitable
in
spite
of
his
shrinking
and
remonstrance
the
more
he
attempted
to
avoid
the
honor
and
to
resist
the
more
did
the
soldiers
in
turn
insist
upon
not
accepting
an
emperor
from
others
but
upon
their
own
right
to
establish
such
a
sovereign
over
the
entire
world
hence
with
a
show
of
reluctance
he
yielded
the
consuls
for
a
time
sent
tribunes
and
others
forbidding
him
to
assume
any
such
authority
and
to
submit
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
people
and
the
senate
and
the
laws
but
when
their
attendant
soldiers
left
them
in
the
lurch
then
finally
they
too
yielded
and
voted
him
all
the
remaining
privileges
pertaining
to
sole
rulership
so
it
was
that
tiberius
claudius
nero
germanicus
the
son
of
drusus
child
of
livia
obtained
the
imperial
power
without
having
been
previously
tested
at
all
in
any
position
of
authority
save
only
that
he
had
been
consul
he
was
fifty
years
of
age
in
mental
development
he
was
by
no
means
inferior
having
been
through
a
sufficient
education
to
do
a
little
history
writing
but
physically
he
was
frail
and
his
head
and
hands
shook
a
little
hence
his
voice
was
also
faltering
and
he
did
not
himself
read
all
the
measures
that
he
introduced
before
the
senate
but
would
give
them
to
the
quæstor
to
read
though
at
first
at
least
he
was
regularly
present
whatever
he
did
read
in
person
he
generally
recited
sitting
down
he
was
the
first
of
the
romans
too
to
employ
a
covered
chair
which
has
led
to
the
present
custom
which
prescribes
that
not
only
the
emperors
be
carried
in
chairs
but
we
as
well
before
this
time
augustus
tiberius
and
some
others
used
to
be
carried
sometimes
in
litters
such
as
women
even
at
the
present
day
affect
these
infirmities
however
were
not
the
cause
of
nearly
so
much
trouble
to
him
as
were
the
freedmen
and
women
with
whom
he
associated
for
more
conspicuously
than
any
of
his
peers
he
was
ruled
by
slaves
and
by
women
from
a
child
he
had
been
reared
with
careful
nursing
and
in
the
midst
of
terror
and
had
for
that
reason
feigned
simplicity
to
a
greater
extent
than
was
really
true
this
fact
he
himself
admitted
in
the
senate
and
as
he
had
lived
for
a
long
time
with
his
grandmother
livia
and
for
another
long
period
with
his
mother
antonia
and
again
with
liberti
and
moreover
had
had
several
amours
with
women
he
had
acquired
no
qualities
becoming
a
freeman
but
although
ruler
of
all
the
romans
and
their
subjects
he
was
himself
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
slave
they
would
take
advantage
of
him
particularly
when
he
was
inclined
to
drink
and
sexual
intercourse
for
in
both
these
directions
he
was
quite
insatiable
and
on
such
occasions
was
exceedingly
easy
to
master
moreover
he
was
afflicted
by
cowardice
which
frequently
roused
in
him
so
great
alarm
that
he
could
not
calculate
anything
as
he
ought
they
anticipated
this
failing
of
his
too
and
it
was
no
inconsiderable
help
toward
getting
the
better
of
him
by
frightening
him
half
to
death
they
would
reap
great
benefits
and
in
other
people
they
inspired
so
much
fear
that
to
give
an
epitome
of
the
situation
once
when
a
number
were
on
the
same
day
invited
to
dinner
by
claudius
and
again
by
his
dependents
the
guests
neglected
him
on
some
indifferent
pretext
and
presented
themselves
at
the
feast
of
his
companions
though
generally
speaking
he
was
the
sort
of
character
described
still
he
performed
not
a
few
valuable
services
whenever
he
was
free
from
the
influences
mentioned
and
was
master
of
himself
i
shall
take
up
his
acts
in
detail
all
honors
voted
to
him
he
immediately
accepted
except
the
title
father
and
this
he
afterward
took
yet
he
did
not
at
once
enter
the
senate
but
delayed
as
late
as
the
thirtieth
day
the
fact
that
he
had
seen
gaius
perish
as
he
did
and
now
learned
that
some
other
candidates
presumably
superior
to
himself
had
been
proposed
for
emperor
by
the
senatorial
body
made
him
a
little
timid
therefore
he
exercised
great
caution
at
all
points
and
caused
all
men
and
women
who
approached
him
to
be
searched
for
fear
they
might
have
a
dagger
at
banquets
he
made
sure
there
were
some
soldiers
present
a
custom
which
set
by
him
continues
to
this
day
that
of
invariable
search
was
brought
to
an
end
by
vespasian
he
put
to
death
chairea
and
some
others
in
spite
of
his
pleasure
at
the
death
of
gaius
in
other
words
he
looked
far
ahead
to
ensure
his
own
safety
and
was
not
so
much
grateful
to
the
man
for
having
by
his
deed
enabled
him
to
get
the
empire
as
he
was
displeased
at
the
idea
of
any
one
assassinating
an
emperor
he
acted
in
this
matter
not
as
an
avenger
of
gaius
but
as
one
who
had
caught
a
person
plotting
against
himself
as
a
sequel
to
this
murder
sabinus
also
died
by
his
own
hand
not
choosing
to
survive
after
his
comrade
had
been
executed
as
for
all
other
citizens
who
had
openly
shown
their
eagerness
for
a
democracy
or
had
been
regarded
as
eligible
for
the
supreme
power
claudius
so
far
from
bearing
malice
toward
them
gave
them
honors
and
offices
in
plainer
terms
than
any
ruler
that
ever
lived
he
promised
them
immunity
therein
imitating
the
example
of
the
athenians
as
he
said
and
it
was
no
mere
promise
but
he
afforded
it
in
fact
he
abolished
complaints
of
maiestas
alike
for
things
written
and
things
done
and
punished
no
one
on
any
such
charge
for
either
earlier
or
later
offences
he
invented
no
complaint
for
the
sake
of
persecuting
those
who
had
wronged
or
insulted
him
when
he
was
a
private
citizen
and
there
were
many
who
had
done
this
particularly
as
he
was
deemed
of
no
importance
and
to
please
either
tiberius
or
gaius
if
however
he
found
them
guilty
of
some
other
crime
he
would
take
vengeance
on
them
also
for
their
former
abuse
the
taxes
introduced
in
the
reign
of
gaius
and
whatever
other
measures
had
led
to
denunciation
of
the
latter
acts
were
done
away
with
by
claudius
not
all
at
once
but
as
opportunity
offered
he
also
brought
back
such
persons
as
gaius
had
unjustly
exiled
others
the
latter
sisters
agrippina
and
julia
and
restored
to
them
their
property
of
those
imprisoned
and
a
very
great
number
were
in
this
predicament
he
liberated
such
as
were
suffering
for
maiestas
or
any
similar
complaints
but
real
criminals
he
punished
he
investigated
the
cases
very
carefully
in
order
that
those
who
had
committed
crimes
should
not
be
released
on
account
of
the
victims
of
blackmail
nor
yet
the
latter
be
ruined
on
account
of
the
former
nearly
every
day
either
in
company
with
the
entire
senate
or
alone
he
would
sit
on
a
platform
trying
cases
generally
in
the
forum
but
occasionally
elsewhere
in
fact
he
renewed
the
custom
of
having
men
sit
as
his
colleagues
which
had
been
abandoned
ever
since
tiberius
withdrew
to
the
island
very
often
he
joined
the
consuls
and
the
prætors
and
especially
those
having
charge
of
the
finances
in
their
investigations
and
some
few
matters
he
turned
over
entirely
to
the
various
courts
he
destroyed
the
poisons
which
were
found
in
great
variety
among
the
effects
of
gaius
and
the
books
of
protogenes
who
was
put
to
death
together
with
the
documents
which
gaius
pretended
to
have
burned
but
which
were
actually
found
in
the
imperial
archives
he
showed
to
the
senators
and
gave
them
to
the
latter
to
the
very
men
who
had
written
them
no
less
than
to
those
against
whom
they
had
been
written
to
read
afterward
he
burned
them
up
yet
when
the
senate
manifested
a
desire
to
dishonor
gaius
he
personally
prevented
such
a
measure
from
being
voted
but
on
his
own
responsibility
caused
all
of
his
predecessor
images
to
disappear
by
night
hence
the
name
of
gaius
does
not
occur
in
the
list
of
emperors
whom
we
mention
in
oaths
and
prayers
any
more
than
that
of
tiberius
neither
of
them
however
suffered
any
official
disgrace
accordingly
the
unjust
institutions
set
up
by
gaius
and
by
others
on
his
account
claudius
overturned
to
drusus
his
father
and
antonia
his
mother
he
offered
on
their
birthdays
putting
off
to
different
days
the
festivals
which
would
occur
on
the
same
dates
in
order
that
there
should
not
be
two
celebrations
at
once
his
grandmother
livia
was
not
only
honored
by
equestrian
contests
but
was
deified
and
he
set
up
a
statue
to
her
in
the
temple
of
augustus
charging
the
vestal
virgins
with
the
duty
of
offering
sacrifice
in
proper
form
he
also
ordered
that
women
should
use
her
name
in
taking
oaths
though
he
paid
such
reverence
to
his
ancestors
he
himself
would
accept
nothing
beyond
the
names
pertaining
to
his
office
on
the
first
day
of
august
to
be
sure
his
birthday
there
were
equestrian
contests
but
not
on
his
account
it
was
because
the
temple
of
mars
had
been
dedicated
on
that
day
which
had
consequently
been
distinguished
thereafter
by
annual
contests
beside
moderation
in
this
respect
he
further
forbade
any
one
worshiping
him
or
offering
him
any
sacrifice
he
checked
the
many
excessive
acclamations
accorded
him
and
he
accepted
only
one
image
of
silver
and
two
statues
of
bronze
and
stone
that
had
been
voted
to
him
at
the
start
all
such
expenditures
he
declared
were
useless
and
furthermore
inflicted
great
loss
and
great
annoyance
upon
the
city
all
the
temples
and
all
the
rest
of
the
public
works
had
been
filled
with
statues
and
votive
offerings
so
that
he
said
he
should
have
to
make
it
a
matter
of
thought
what
to
do
with
them
he
forbade
the
prætors
giving
gladiatorial
games
and
ordained
that
any
one
else
who
superintended
them
in
any
place
whatsoever
should
not
allow
to
be
written
or
reported
the
statement
that
such
games
were
being
held
for
the
emperor
preservation
he
became
so
used
to
settling
all
these
matters
by
considering
the
merits
of
each
case
rather
than
according
to
the
dictates
of
custom
that
he
adopted
the
same
attitude
toward
other
departments
of
life
for
instance
when
this
year
he
betrothed
one
of
his
daughters
to
lucius
junius
silanus
and
gave
the
other
in
marriage
to
gnæus
pompeius
magnus
he
did
nothing
out
of
the
common
to
commemorate
the
occasion
but
attended
the
courts
in
person
on
those
days
and
convened
the
senate
as
usual
he
ordered
his
temporarily
to
hold
office
among
the
viginti
viri
and
later
to
act
as
prefects
of
the
city
at
the
feriæ
after
a
long
interval
he
gave
them
the
right
to
stand
for
the
other
offices
five
years
sooner
than
was
customary
gaius
had
despoiled
this
pompeius
of
his
title
and
came
very
near
killing
him
because
he
was
so
named
yet
out
of
contempt
for
him
since
he
was
still
but
a
boy
he
did
not
go
to
such
extremes
and
merely
abolished
the
offending
epithet
saying
that
it
was
not
safe
for
any
one
to
be
called
magnus
claudius
now
restored
to
him
this
title
and
gave
him
his
daughter
to
wife
these
were
certainly
commendable
actions
in
addition
when
at
one
time
in
the
senate
the
consuls
came
down
from
their
seats
to
talk
with
him
he
rose
in
turn
and
went
to
meet
them
in
naples
he
lived
entirely
like
a
private
citizen
he
and
his
associates
while
there
adopted
the
greek
manner
of
life
invariably
at
the
musical
entertainments
he
would
wear
cloak
and
military
boots
and
at
the
gymnastic
exercises
a
purple
robe
and
golden
crown
his
action
moreover
in
regard
to
money
was
remarkable
for
he
forbade
any
one
to
bring
him
contributions
as
had
been
customary
in
the
reigns
of
augustus
and
of
gaius
and
he
refused
to
allow
any
person
to
name
him
as
heir
if
such
person
possessed
any
relatives
whatever
indeed
the
funds
that
had
been
confiscated
by
government
order
during
the
period
of
tiberius
and
gaius
he
gave
back
either
to
the
victims
themselves
if
they
still
survived
or
otherwise
to
their
children
it
had
been
the
custom
that
if
any
slightest
detail
were
carried
out
contrary
to
precedent
on
the
occasion
of
the
games
these
should
be
given
over
again
as
i
have
stated
but
since
such
occasions
were
frequent
occurring
a
third
fourth
fifth
and
sometimes
tenth
time
and
this
partly
by
accident
but
generally
by
intention
on
the
part
of
those
benefited
by
these
happenings
he
enacted
a
law
that
on
only
one
day
should
the
equestrian
contests
take
place
a
second
time
in
fact
however
he
usually
abrogated
this
privilege
also
the
schemers
henceforth
easily
avoided
falling
into
irregularities
as
they
gained
very
little
by
so
doing
in
the
matter
of
the
jews
who
had
again
increased
so
greatly
that
by
reason
of
their
multitude
it
would
have
been
hard
without
raising
a
tumult
to
bar
them
from
the
city
he
decided
not
to
drive
them
out
but
ordered
them
to
follow
that
mode
of
life
prescribed
by
their
ancestral
custom
and
not
to
assemble
in
the
clubs
instituted
by
gaius
he
also
seeing
that
there
was
no
use
in
forbidding
the
populace
to
do
certain
things
unless
their
daily
life
should
be
reorganized
he
abolished
the
taverns
where
they
were
wont
to
gather
and
drink
and
commanded
that
no
dressed
meat
nor
warm
water
should
be
sold
some
who
disobeyed
this
ordinance
were
punished
he
restored
to
the
various
cities
the
statues
which
gaius
was
in
the
habit
of
requiring
them
to
send
restored
also
to
the
dioscuri
their
temple
and
to
pompey
the
right
of
naming
the
theatre
on
the
of
the
latter
he
inscribed
also
the
name
of
tiberius
because
that
emperor
had
rebuilt
the
structure
when
it
was
burned
his
own
name
he
had
chiseled
there
likewise
not
because
he
had
reared
it
but
because
he
had
dedicated
it
but
on
no
other
part
of
the
edifice
likewise
he
did
not
wear
the
triumphal
garb
the
entire
time
of
the
games
though
permission
was
voted
to
him
but
appeared
in
it
merely
to
offer
sacrifice
the
rest
of
the
festival
he
superintended
in
the
garment
he
introduced
in
the
orchestra
among
others
knights
and
women
who
were
his
peers
who
had
been
accustomed
in
the
reign
of
gaius
so
to
appear
regularly
the
reason
was
not
that
he
liked
their
performance
but
that
he
wanted
a
proof
of
their
past
behavior
certainly
none
of
them
was
again
marshaled
on
the
stage
during
the
era
of
claudius
the
pyrrhic
dance
which
the
boys
sent
for
by
gaius
were
practicing
they
were
allowed
to
perform
once
were
honored
with
citizenship
for
it
and
were
then
dismissed
others
in
turn
chosen
from
among
the
retinue
then
gave
this
was
what
took
place
in
theatrical
circles
in
the
hippodrome
twelve
camels
and
horses
had
one
contest
and
three
hundred
bears
together
with
an
equal
number
of
libyan
beasts
were
slaughtered
previous
to
this
time
the
different
classes
in
attendance
had
watched
the
spectacle
each
from
its
own
special
location
senators
knights
and
populace
thus
it
had
come
to
be
a
regular
practice
yet
no
definite
positions
had
been
assigned
to
them
it
was
at
this
time
that
claudius
marked
off
the
space
which
still
belongs
to
the
senate
and
furthermore
he
allowed
those
senators
who
chose
to
view
the
sights
somewhere
else
and
even
in
citizen
dress
after
this
he
banqueted
the
senators
and
their
wives
the
knights
and
likewise
the
tribes
next
he
restored
commagene
to
antiochus
for
gaius
though
he
had
himself
given
him
the
district
had
taken
it
away
again
and
mithridates
the
iberian
whom
gaius
had
summoned
only
to
imprison
he
sent
home
again
to
resume
his
sovereignty
to
another
mithridates
a
lineal
descendant
of
mithridates
the
great
he
granted
bosporus
giving
to
polemon
some
land
in
cilicia
in
place
of
it
he
enlarged
the
domain
of
agrippa
of
palestine
who
happening
to
be
in
rome
had
helped
him
become
emperor
and
bestowed
on
him
consular
honors
to
the
latter
brother
herod
he
gave
pretorial
dignities
and
some
authority
they
were
allowed
to
enter
the
senate
and
to
express
their
thanks
to
him
in
now
these
were
the
acts
of
claudius
himself
and
they
were
lauded
by
all
but
certain
other
deeds
were
done
at
this
time
of
an
entirely
different
nature
by
his
freedmen
and
by
his
wife
valeria
messalina
she
became
enraged
at
her
niece
julia
because
the
latter
neither
paid
her
honor
nor
flattered
her
and
she
was
also
jealous
because
the
girl
was
extremely
beautiful
and
had
been
the
only
one
to
enjoy
the
favor
of
claudius
several
times
accordingly
she
had
her
banished
by
bringing
against
her
among
other
complaints
that
of
adultery
for
which
annius
seneca
was
also
exiled
and
after
a
while
she
succeeded
in
procuring
julia
death
as
for
the
freedmen
it
was
they
who
persuaded
claudius
to
accept
triumphal
honors
for
his
deeds
in
mauretania
though
he
had
not
been
successful
and
had
not
yet
attained
imperial
power
when
the
end
of
the
war
came
this
same
year
however
sulpicius
galba
overcame
the
chatti
and
publius
gabinius
conquered
the
cauchi
beside
winning
fame
in
other
ways
for
instance
he
recovered
a
military
eagle
the
only
one
left
among
the
enemy
from
the
catastrophe
of
varus
through
the
exploits
of
both
of
these
men
claudius
received
a
title
of
imperator
that
had
some
foundation
in
fact
the
next
year
the
same
moors
were
again
subdued
in
fighting

far
as
the
atlantic
gnæus
hosidius
geta
one
of
the
peers
making
a
subsequent
campaign
advanced
at
once
against
their
general
salabus
and
conquered
him
two
separate
times
and
when
the
latter
after
leaving
a
few
soldiers
near
the
frontier
to
hold
back
any
who
might
pursue
took
refuge
in
the
sandy
part
of
the
country
geta
ventured
to
follow
him
first
stationing
a
part
of
his
army
opposite
the
hostile
detachment
that
was
awaiting
him
he
provided
himself
with
as
much
water
as
was
feasible
and
pushed
forward
when
this
supply
gave
out
and
no
more
could
be
found
he
was
caught
in
an
exceedingly
unpleasant
position
the
barbarians
especially
since
through
habit
they
can
endure
thirst
an
exceedingly
long
time
and
through
knowledge
of
the
country
can
always
get
water
had
no
trouble
in
maintaining
themselves
the
romans
for
the
opposite
reasons
found
it
impossible
to
advance
and
difficult
to
withdraw
while
geta
was
in
a
dilemma
as
to
what
he
should
do
one
of
the
natives
who
was
at
peace
with
the
invaders
persuaded
him
to
make
use
of
incantations
and
enchantments
telling
him
that
as
a
result
of
such
procedure
abundant
water
had
frequently
been
granted
them
no
sooner
had
he
taken
this
advice
than
so
much
rain
burst
from
heaven
as
to
allay
the
thirst
entirely
beside
scaring
the
enemy
who
thought
the
gods
were
assisting
the
roman
consequently
they
came
to
terms
voluntarily
and
ended
their
after
these
events
claudius
divided
the
moors
who
were
in
subjection
into
two
districts
namely
the
country
about
tengis
and
that
about
cæsarea
these
cities
giving
their
names
to
the
whole
region
and
he
appointed
two
knights
as
governors
at
this
same
period
certain
parts
of
numidia
also
were
involved
in
warfare
by
neighboring
barbarians
and
when
the
latter
had
been
conquered
returned
to
a
state
of
repose
the
office
of
consul
claudius
held
in
conjunction
with
gaius
largus
he
allowed
the
latter
to
continue
consul
for
a
whole
year
but
as
for
himself
he
remained
a
magistrate
only
two
months
at
this
time
he
had
the
rest
swear
to
the
deeds
of
augustus
and
was
himself
sworn
but
in
regard
to
his
own
deeds
he
allowed
no
such
procedure
on
the
part
of
any
one
on
leaving
the
office
he
took
the
oath
again
like
other
people
this
was
always
his
practice
every
time
he
was
consul
about
this
period
certain
speeches
of
augustus
and
tiberius
were
being
read
according
to
decree
on
the
first
of
the
month
and
when
they
had
kept
the
senators
busy
till
evening
he
ended
the
reading
declaring
that
it
was
sufficient
for
them
to
be
engraved
on
tablets
some
prætors
who
were
entrusted
with
the
administration
of
the
funds
having
incurred
charges
he
did
not
take
legal
measures
against
them
but
made
the
rounds
of
those
who
sold
goods
and
let
buildings
and
corrected
whatever
he
deemed
to
be
abuses
this
he
did
also
on
numerous
other
there
were
likewise
peculiarities
in
the
appointment
of
the
prætors
for
their
number
was
now
fourteen
or
eighteen
or
somewhere
between
just
as
it
beside
this
action
with
reference
to
the
finances
he
established
a
board
of
three
to
collect
debts
owing
the
government
granting
them
lictors
and
the
usual
force
of
assistants
on
the
occasion
of
a
severe
famine
he
considered
the
problem
of
abundant
provisions
not
only
for
that
particular
crisis
but
for
all
succeeding
time
practically
all
food
used
by
the
romans
was
imported
and
yet
the
region
near
the
mouth
of
the
tiber
had
no
safe
nor
suitable
harbors
so
that
their
mastery
of
the
sea
was
rendered
useless
save
for
such
staples
as
were
brought
in
during
their
season
and
stored
in
warehouses
nothing
from
abroad
could
be
had
in
the
winter
season
and
if
any
one
risked
a
voyage
he
was
almost
sure
to
meet
with
disaster
being
cognizant
of
these
facts
claudius
undertook
to
build
a
harbor
and
would
not
be
turned
aside
though
the
architects
on
his
enquiring
how
great
the
expense
would
be
replied
you
do
want
to
do
this
so
sure
were
they
that
the
great
disbursements
necessary
would
cause
him
to
rein
in
his
ambition
if
he
should
learn
beforehand
the
exact
amount
he
however
desired
a
work
worthy
of
the
dignity
and
greatness
of
rome
and
he
brought
it
to
a
successful
conclusion
in
the
first
place
he
excavated
a
very
considerable
piece
of
land
constructed
quays
on
all
sides
of
it
and
let
the
sea
into
it
next
in
the
sea
itself
he
heaped
huge
mounds
on
both
sides
of
the
entrance
to
this
place
mounds
that
enclosed
a
large
body
of
water
between
these
breakwaters
he
reared
an
island
and
planted
on
it
a
tower
with
a
beacon
this
harbor
then
still
so
called
in
local
parlance
was
created
by
him
at
this
period
he
had
another
project
to
make
an
outlet
into
the
liris
from
lake
fucina
in
the
marsian
country
to
the
end
that
the
land
around
it
might
be
tilled
and
the
river
be
rendered
more
navigable
but
the
expenditure
was
all
to
no
purpose
he
made
a
number
of
laws
most
of
which
i
have
no
need
to
mention
but
here
are
some
of
the
regulations
that
he
introduced
he
had
the
governors
who
were
chosen
by
lot
set
out
before
the
first
day
of
april
for
it
was
their
habit
to
delay
a
long
time
in
the
city
and
he
would
not
permit
those
chosen
by
election
to
express
any
thanks
to
him
in
the
senate
this
had
been
a
kind
of
custom
with
them
but
he
said
these
persons
ought
not
to
thank
me
as
if
they
were
so
eager
for
office
but
i
them
because
they
cheerfully
help
me
bear
the
burden
of
government
and
if
they
acquit
themselves
well
in
office
i
shall
praise
them
still
more
such
men
as
by
reason
of
insufficient
means
were
not
able
to
be
senators
he
allowed
to
ask
permission
to
retire
and
he
admitted
some
of
the
knights
to
tribuneships
the
rest
of
them
without
exception
he
forced
to
attend
the
senate
as
often
as
notice
was
sent
them
he
was
so
severe
upon
those
who
were
remiss
in
this
matter
that
some
killed
themselves
in
other
respects
he
was
sociable
and
considerate
in
his
dealings
with
them
he
would
visit
them
when
sick
and
be
a
partner
in
their
merrymakings
a
certain
tribune
beat
a
slave
of
his
in
public
but
claudius
did
the
offender
himself
no
harm
only
depriving
him
of
his
assistants
and
these
he
restored
not
long
afterward
another
of
his
slaves
was
sent
to
the
forum
and
severely
scourged
because
he
had
insulted
a
prominent
man
in
the
senate
the
emperor
would
himself
regularly
rise
in
case
the
rest
had
been
standing
for
a
long
time
on
account
of
his
ill
health
as
i
related
he
frequently
remained
seated
and
read
his
advice
if
asked
for
it
he
allowed
lucius
sulla
to
sit
on
the
prætors
bench
because
this
man
being
unable
by
reason
of
age
to
hear
anything
from
his
own
seat
had
stood
up
the
day
on
which
a
year
previous
he
had
been
declared
emperor
he
did
nothing
unusual
except
to
give
the
pretorians
denarii
and
this
he
continued
to
do
every
year
thereafter
some
of
the
prætors
however
of
their
own
free
will
and
not
by
any
decree
publicly
celebrated
that
day
and
also
the
birthday
of
messalina
not
all
of
them
did
this
but
as
many
as
chose
this
shows
what
freedom
they
had
you
may
see
how
really
moderate
claudius
was
in
all
such
matters
from
the
fact
that
when
a
son
was
born
to
him
called
at
that
time
claudius
tiberius
germanicus
but
later
also
he
did
not
make
the
occasion
in
any
way
conspicuous
and
would
not
allow
him
to
be
named
augustus
nor
messalina
augusta
he
was
constantly
arranging
gladiatorial
games
taking
a
degree
of
pleasure
in
them
that
aroused
criticism
very
few
beasts
were
destroyed
but
a
great
many
human
beings
some
of
whom
fought
with
one
another
whereas
others
were
devoured
by
animals
the
emperor
hated
vehemently
the
freed
slaves
who
in
the
reigns
of
tiberius
and
gaius
had
conspired
against
their
masters
as
well
as
those
who
extorted
blackmail
from
people
or
had
borne
false
witness
against
any
persons
the
majority
of
these
he
got
rid
of
in
the
manner
mentioned
though
some
of
them
he
punished
by
other
methods
a
great
many
he
delivered
up
to
the
vengeance
of
their
masters
so
great
did
the
number
become
of
those
who
died
a
public
death
that
the
statue
of
augustus
erected
on
the
scene
was
turned
to
face
in
another
direction
both
to
prevent
its
being
thought
that
was
viewing
the
slaughter
and
to
avoid
having
the
statue
always
covered
up
for
this
act
claudius
was
well
laughed
at
when
people
reflected
how
he
sated
himself
with
the
sights
that
he
did
not
think
proper
for
even
the
inanimate
bronze
to
behold
it
might
be
noted
particularly
that
he
used
to
delight
greatly
even
at
lunch
time
in
watching
those
who
were
incidentally
cut
down
in
the
middle
of
the
spectacle
yet
a
lion
that
had
been
trained
to
eat
men
and
on
this
account
greatly
pleased
the
crowd
he
ordered
killed
on
the
principle
that
it
was
not
fitting
for
romans
to
gaze
on
such
a
sight
he
received
abundant
praise
however
for
appearing
in
the
people
midst
at
the
spectacle
for
giving
them
all
they
wanted
and
for
his
employing
a
herald
so
very
little
and
announcing
most
events
by
notices
written
on
boards
after
he
had
become
accustomed
then
to
feast
his
fill
on
blood
and
slaughter
he
had
recourse
more
readily
to
other
kinds
of
killings
the
cæsarians
and
messalina
were
really
responsible
for
this
whenever
they
desired
to
obtain
any
one
death
they
would
terrify
him
with
the
result
that
they
would
be
allowed
to
do
everything
they
chose
often
when
in
a
moment
of
sudden
alarm
his
momentary
terror
had
led
him
to
order
some
one
death
afterward
when
he
recovered
and
came
to
his
senses
he
would
search
for
the
man
and
on
learning
what
had
happened
would
be
grieved
and
repent
he
began
this
series
of
slaughters
with
gaius
appius
silanus
this
man
who
was
of
very
noble
family
and
at
the
time
was
governor
of
spain
he
had
sent
for
pretending
that
he
wanted
to
see
him
about
something
had
married
him
to
messalina
mother
and
had
for
some
time
held
him
in
honor
among
his
dearest
and
closest
friends
then
he
suddenly
killed
him
the
reason
was
that
silanus
had
offended
messalina
the
most
abandoned
and
lustful
of
women
in
refusing
to
lie
with
her
and
by
the
slight
shown
the
empress
had
alienated
narcissus
the
emperor
freedman
as
they
had
no
true
charge
to
bring
against
him
nor
even
one
that
would
be
believed
narcissus
invented
a
dream
in
which
he
declared
he
had
seen
claudius
murdered
by
the
hand
of
silanus
so
just
before
dawn
while
the
emperor
was
still
in
bed
he
came
all
of
a
tremble
to
tell
him
the
dream
and
messalina
by
expatiating
on
it
made
it
worse
thus
silanus
perished
just
because
of
a
vision
after
the
latter
death
the
romans
at
once
lost
confidence
in
claudius
and
annius
vinicianus
with
some
others
formed
a
plot
against
him
the
chief
conspirator
had
been
one
of
those
proposed
at
the
death
of
gaius
for
the
imperial
office
and
it
was
partly
fear
inspired
by
this
fact
that
caused
him
to
rebel
as
he
possessed
no
considerable
force
however
he
sent
to
furius
camillus
scribonianus
governor
of
dalmatia
who
had
a
large
body
of
native
and
foreign
troops
camillus
who
was
inclined
to
the
project
of
his
own
accord
was
induced
to
revolt
at
the
same
time
particularly
because
he
had
been
spoken
of
for
emperor
when
so
much
had
been
accomplished
many
senators
and
knights
joined
the
ranks
of
annius
they
did
him
no
good
however
for
the
soldiers
because
camillus
proffered
them
the
name
of
and
promised
that
he
would
restore
to
them
their
ancient
freedom
suspected
that
they
should
have
troubles
and
changes
of
government
again
and
would
therefore
no
longer
obey
him
then
in
terror
he
fled
from
them
and
coming
to
the
island
issa
he
there
met
a
voluntary
death
claudius
for
a
time
was
quite
cowed
with
fear
and
was
ready
at
a
demand
from
camillus
to
withdraw
from
his
sovereignty
voluntarily
later
he
recovered
courage
and
rewarded
his
soldiers
among
other
methods
by
having
the
citizen
legions
the
seventh
and
the
eleventh
named
the
claudian
and
the
faithful
and
the
pious
by
the
senate
itself
then
he
made
reprisals
upon
those
who
had
plotted
against
him
and
on
this
charge
put
many
to
death
among
them
a
prætor
who
first
had
to
resign
his
office
numbers
of
whom
vinicianus
was
one
committed
suicide
for
messalina
and
narcissus
and
all
the
fellow
freedmen
seized
this
opportunity
to
wreak
their
direst
vengeance
they
employed
slaves
and
liberti
for
instance
and
informers
against
their
own
masters
these
masters
and
others
of
undoubted
nobility
foreigners
and
citizens
alike
not
only
plebeians
but
some
of
the
knights
and
senators
were
put
to
the
torture
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
claudius
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
reign
had
sworn
not
to
torture
any
free
citizen
many
men
therefore
at
this
time
and
many
women
incurred
punishment
some
of
the
latter
met
their
fate
right
in
the
prison
and
when
they
were
to
die
were
actually
led
in
chains
upon
a
scaffold
like
captives
and
their
bodies
like
those
of
others
were
thrown
down
the
scalæ
gemoniæ
of
those
who
were
executed
outside
the
prison
only
the
heads
were
exhibited
in
that
place
some
of
the
most
guilty
nevertheless
either
through
favoritism
or
by
the
use
of
money
saved
their
necks
with
the
help
of
messalina
and
of
the
cæsarians
following
narcissus
all
the
children
of
those
who
perished
were
granted
immunity
and
some
received
money
trials
were
held
in
the
in
the
presence
of
claudius
his
prefects
and
his
freedmen
with
a
consul
on
each
side
he
made
his
report
to
the
senators
while
seated
upon
a
chair
of
state
or
on
a
bench
next
he
himself
went
to
his
accustomed
seat
and
chairs
were
set
for
his
escort
this
same
program
was
followed
also
at
the
other
most
important
functions
it
was
at
this
time
that
a
certain
galæsus
a
freedman
of
camillus
was
brought
into
the
senate
and
talked
with
the
utmost
frankness
on
a
variety
of
subjects
the
following
remark
of
his
is
worth
instancing
narcissus
had
taken
the
floor
and
said
to
him
what
would
you
have
done
galæsus
if
camillus
had
become
monarch
he
replied
i
should
have
stood
behind
him
and
said
nothing
so
he
became
famous
for
this
speech
and
arria
for
something
quite
different
the
latter
who
was
wife
of
cæcina
pætus
refused
to
live
after
he
had
been
put
to
death
although
being
on
very
intimate
terms
with
messalina
she
might
have
occupied
a
position
of
some
honor
moreover
when
her
husband
showed
cowardice
she
strengthened
his
resolution
she
took
the
sword
and
gave
herself
a
wound
then
handed
it
to
him
saying
see
pætus
i
feel
no
pain
these
two
persons
then
were
accorded
praise
for
by
reason
of
the
long
succession
of
woes
matters
had
now
come
to
such
a
pass
that
excellence
no
longer
meant
anything
else
than
dying
nobly
the
attitude
of
claudius
in
bringing
destruction
upon
them
and
others
is
indicated
by
his
forever
giving
to
the
soldiers
as
a
watchword
this
verse
about
its
being
necessary
in
one
first
anger
to
ward
off
the
foe
he
kept
throwing
out
many
other
hints
of
that
sort
in
greek
both
to
them
and
to
the
senate
with
the
result
that
those
who
could
understand
any
of
them
laughed
at
him
these
were
some
of
the
happenings
of
that
and
the
tribunes
at
the
death
of
one
of
their
number
themselves
convened
the
senate
for
the
purpose
of
appointing
a
tribune
to
succeed
him
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
consuls
were
accessible
when
claudius
now
became
consul
again
it
was
the
third
time
he
put
an
end
to
many
sacrifices
and
many
feast
days
for
as
the
greater
part
of
the
year
was
given
up
to
them
no
small
damage
was
done
to
public
business
beside
curtailing
the
number
of
these
he
retrenched
in
all
the
other
ways
that
he
could
what
had
been
given
away
by
gaius
without
any
justice
or
reason
he
demanded
back
from
the
recipients
but
he
gave
back
to
the
road
commissioners
all
that
his
predecessor
had
exacted
in
fines
on
account
of
corbulo
moreover
he
gave
notice
to
magistrates
chosen
by
lot
since
they
were
even
now
slow
about
leaving
the
city
that
they
must
commence
their
journey
before
the
middle
of
april
came
he
reduced
to
servitude
the
lycians
who
rising
in
revolt
had
slain
some
romans
and
merged
them
in
the
prefecture
of
pamphylia
during
the
investigation
which
was
conducted
in
the
he
put
a
question
in
the
latin
tongue
to
one
of
the
envoys
who
had
originally
been
a
lycian
but
had
been
made
a
roman
as
the
man
did
not
understand
what
was
said
he
took
away
his
citizenship
saying
that
it
was
not
proper
for
a
person
to
be
a
roman
who
had
no
knowledge
of
roman
speech
a
great
many
other
persons
unworthy
of
citizenship
were
excluded
from
its
privileges
whereas
he
granted
it
to
some
quite
without
restrictions
either
individuals
or
large
bodies
of
men
and
inasmuch
as
practically
everywhere
romans
were
esteemed
above
foreigners
many
sought
the
franchise
by
personal
application
to
the
emperor
and
many
bought
it
from
messalina
and
the
cæsarians
for
this
reason
though
the
right
was
at
first
bartered
only
for
great
sums
it
later
was
so
cheapened
by
the
facility
with
which
it
could
be
obtained
that
it
came
to
be
said
that
if
a
person
only
gave
a
man
some
broken
glassware
he
might
become
a
citizen
this
behavior
then
subjected
the
emperor
to
no
end
of
jests
but
he
received
praise
for
such
actions
as
the
following
many
persons
were
all
the
time
becoming
objects
of
blackmail
some
because
they
did
not
use
claudius
proper
title
and
others
because
they
were
going
to
leave
him
nothing
when
they
died
the
blackmailers
asserting
that
it
was
necessary
for
those
who
obtained
citizenship
from
him
to
do
both
of
these
things
the
emperor
now
stepped
in
and
forbade
that
any
one
should
be
called
to
account
for
such
now
messalina
and
his
freedmen
kept
offering
for
sale
and
peddling
out
not
merely
the
franchise
and
military
posts
and
positions
as
procurator
and
governmental
offices
but
everything
in
general
to
such
an
extent
that
all
necessaries
grew
scarce
and
claudius
was
forced
to
muster
the
populace
on
the
campus
martius
and
there
from
a
platform
to
ordain
what
the
prices
of
wares
should
be
claudius
himself
wearing
a
chlamys
gave
a
contest
of
armed
men
at
the
camp
his
son
birthday
was
observed
voluntarily
by
the
prætors
with
a
kind
of
spectacle
that
they
produced
and
with
dinners
this
was
once
afterward
repeated
too
at
least
by
all
of
them
that
chose
meanwhile
messalina
was
exhibiting
her
own
licentious
tendencies
and
was
forcing
the
other
women
of
her
circle
to
show
themselves
equally
unchaste
many
of
them
she
caused
to
commit
adultery
in
the
very
palace
while
their
husbands
were
present
and
observed
what
took
place
such
men
she
loved
and
cherished
and
crowned
with
honors
and
offices
but
others
who
would
not
submit
to
this
humiliation
she
hated
and
brought
to
destruction
in
every
possible
way
these
deeds
however
though
of
such
a
character
and
carried
on
so
openly
for
a
long
while
never
came
to
the
notice
of
claudius
messalina
gave
him
some
attractive
housemaids
for
bedfellows
and
intercepted
those
who
were
able
to
afford
him
any
information
some
by
kindness
and
some
by
punishments
thus
at
this
period
she
succeeded
in
putting
out
of
the
way
catonius
justus
captain
of
the
pretorian
guard
before
he
could
carry
out
his
intention
of
telling
the
emperor
something
about
these
doings
and
becoming
jealous
of
julia
daughter
of
drusus
son
of
tiberius
and
later
wife
of
nero
germanicus
just
as
she
had
been
of
the
other
julia
she
compassed
her
it
was
about
then
also
that
one
of
the
knights
on
the
charge
of
having
conspired
against
claudius
was
hurled
down
the
capitoline
by
the
tribunes
and
the
consuls
at
the
same
time
that
these
events
were
happening
in
the
city
aulus
plautius
a
senator
of
great
renown
made
a
campaign
against
britain
the
cause
was
that
a
certain
bericus
who
had
been
ejected
from
the
island
during
a
revolution
had
persuaded
claudius
to
send
a
body
of
troops
there
this
plautius
after
he
was
made
general
had
difficulty
in
leading
his
army
beyond
gaul
the
soldiers
objected
on
the
ground
that
their
operations
were
to
take
place
outside
the
limits
of
the
known
world
and
would
not
yield
him
obedience
until
the
arrival
of
narcissus
sent
by
claudius
who
mounted
the
tribunal
of
plautius
and
tried
to
address
them
this
made
them
more
irritated
than
ever
and
they
would
not
allow
the
newcomer
to
say
a
word
but
all
suddenly
shouted
together
the
phrase
ho
ho
the
saturnalia
for
at
the
festival
of
saturn
slaves
celebrate
the
occasion
by
donning
their
masters
dress
after
this
they
at
once
followed
plautius
voluntarily
but
their
delay
had
brought
the
expedition
late
in
the
season
three
divisions
were
made
in
order
that
they
might
not
be
hindered
in
advancing
as
might
happen
to
a
single
force
and
some
of
them
in
their
voyage
across
became
discouraged
because
they
were
buffeted
into
a
backward
course
whereas
others
acquired
confidence
from
the
fact
that
a
flash
of
light
starting
from
the
east
shot
across
to
the
west
the
direction
in
which
they
were
sailing
so
they
came
to
anchor
on
the
shore
of
the
island
and
found
no
one
to
oppose
them
the
britons
as
a
result
of
their
inquiries
had
not
expected
that
they
would
come
and
had
therefore
not
assembled
beforehand
nor
even
at
this
time
would
they
come
into
closer
conflict
with
the
invaders
but
took
refuge
in
the
swamps
and
in
the
forests
hoping
to
exhaust
their
opponents
in
some
other
way
so
that
the
latter
as
in
the
days
of
julius
cæsar
would
sail
back
plautius
accordingly
had
considerable
trouble
in
searching
for
they
were
not
free
and
independent
but
were
parceled
out
among
various
when
at
last
he
did
find
them
he
conquered
first
caratacus
and
next
togodumnus
children
of
cynobelinus
who
was
dead
after
the
flight
of
those
kings
he
attached
by
treaty
a
portion
of
the
bodunni
ruled
by
a
nation
of
the
catuellani
leaving
a
garrison
there
he
advanced
farther
on
reaching
a
certain
river
which
the
barbarians
thought
the
romans
would
not
be
able
to
cross
without
a
bridge
a
conviction
which
led
them
to
encamp
in
rather
careless
fashion
on
the
opposite
bank
he
sent
ahead
celtæ
who
were
accustomed
to
swim
easily
in
full
armor
across
the
most
turbulent
streams
these
fell
unexpectedly
upon
the
enemy
but
instead
of
shooting
at
any
of
the
men
confined
themselves
to
wounding
the
horses
that
drew
their
chariots
and
consequently
in
the
confusion
not
even
the
mounted
warriors
could
save
themselves
plautius
sent
across
also
fiavius
vespasian
who
afterward
obtained
the
imperial
office
and
his
brother
sabinus
a
lieutenant
of
his
so
they
likewise
got
over
the
river
in
some
way
and
killed
numbers
of
the
foe
who
were
not
aware
of
their
approach
the
survivors
however
did
not
take
to
flight
and
on
the
next
day
joined
issue
with
them
again
the
two
forces
were
rather
evenly
matched
until
gnæus
hosidius
geta
at
the
risk
of
being
captured
managed
to
conquer
the
barbarians
in
such
a
way
that
he
received
triumphal
honors
without
having
ever
been
consul
thence
the
britons
retired
to
the
river
thames
at
a
point
near
where
it
empties
into
the
ocean
and
the
latter
forms
a
lake
this
they
crossed
easily
because
they
knew
where
the
firm
ground
in
this
locality
and
the
easy
passages
were
but
the
romans
in
following
them
up
came
to
grief
at
this
spot
however
when
the
celtæ
swam
across
again
and
some
others
had
traversed
a
bridge
a
little
way
up
stream
they
assailed
the
barbarians
from
many
sides
at
once
and
cut
down
large
numbers
of
them
in
pursuing
the
remainder
incautiously
they
got
into
swamps
from
which
it
was
not
easy
to
make
one
way
out
and
in
this
way
lost
many
men
shortly
after
togodumnus
perished
but
the
britons
so
far
from
yielding
stood
together
all
the
more
closely
to
avenge
his
death
because
of
this
fact
and
his
previous
mishap
plautius
became
alarmed
and
instead
of
advancing
farther
proceeded
to
guard
what
he
had
already
gained
and
sent
for
claudius
he
had
been
notified
to
do
this
in
case
he
met
with
any
particularly
stubborn
resistance
and
a
large
reinforcement
for
the
army
consisting
partly
of
elephants
had
been
assembled
in
advance
when
the
message
reached
him
claudius
entrusted
domestic
affairs
including
the
management
of
the
soldiers
to
his
colleague
vitellius
whom
he
had
caused
to
become
consul
like
himself
for
the
entire
six
months
period
and
started
himself
on
the
expedition
he
sailed
down
the
river
to
ostia
and
from
there
followed
the
coast
to
massilia
thence
advancing
partly
by
land
and
partly
along
the
water
courses
he
came
to
the
ocean
and
crossed
over
to
britain
where
he
joined
the
legions
that
were
waiting
for
him
near
the
thames
taking
charge
of
these
he
crossed
the
stream
and
encountering
the
barbarians
who
had
gathered
at
his
approach
he
defeated
them
in
a
pitched
battle
and
captured
camulodunum
the
capital
of
cynobelinus
next
he
extended
his
authority
over
numerous
tribes
in
some
cases
by
treaty
in
others
by
force
and
was
frequently
contrary
to
precedent
saluted
as
imperator
the
usual
practice
is
that
no
single
person
may
receive
this
title
more
than
once
from
one
and
the
same
war
he
deprived
those
he
conquered
of
their
arms
and
assigned
them
to
the
attention
of
plautius
bidding
him
to
subjugate
the
regions
that
were
left
claudius
himself
now
hastened
back
to
rome
sending
ahead
the
news
of
the
victory
by
his
magnus
and
silanus
the
senate
on
learning
of
his
achievement
gave
him
the
title
of
britannicus
and
allowed
him
to
celebrate
a
triumph
they
voted
also
that
there
should
be
an
animal
festival
commemorating
the
event
and
that
an
arch
bearing
a
trophy
should
be
erected
in
the
city
and
a
second
in
gaul
because
it
was
from
that
district
that
he
had
set
sail
in
crossing
over
to
britain
they
bestowed
on
his
son
the
same
honorific
title
as
upon
him
so
that
claudius
was
known
in
a
way
as
britannicus
proper
messalina
was
granted
the
same
privilege
of
front
seats
as
livia
had
enjoyed
and
also
the
use
of
the
carpentum
these
were
the
honors
bestowed
upon
the
imperial
family
the
memory
of
gaius
disgusted
the
senators
so
much
that
they
resolved
that
all
the
bronze
coinage
which
had
his
image
stamped
upon
it
should
be
melted
down
though
this
was
done
yet
the
bronze
was
converted
to
no
better
use
for
messalina
made
statues
of
mnester
the
dancer
out
of
it
inasmuch
as
the
latter
had
once
been
on
intimate
terms
with
gaius
she
made
this
offering
as
a
mark
of
gratitude
for
his
consenting
to
a
with
her
she
had
been
madly
enamored
of
him
and
when
she
found
herself
unable
in
any
way
either
by
promises
or
by
frightening
him
to
persuade
him
to
have
intercourse
with
her
she
had
a
talk
with
her
husband
and
asked
him
that
the
man
might
be
forced
to
obey
her
pretending
that
she
wanted
his
help
for
some
different
purpose
claudius
accordingly
told
him
to
do
whatsoever
he
should
be
ordered
by
messalina
on
these
terms
he
agreed
to
enjoy
her
alleging
that
he
had
been
commanded
to
do
so
by
her
husband
messalina
adopted
this
same
method
with
numerous
other
men
and
committed
adultery
feigning
that
claudius
knew
what
was
taking
place
and
countenanced
her
unchastity
portions
of
britain
then
were
captured
at
this
time
in
the
manner
described
after
this
during
the
second
consulship
of
gaius
crispus
and
the
first
of
titus
statilius
claudius
came
to
rome
at
the
end
of
a
six
months
absence
from
the
city
of
which
time
he
had
spent
only
sixteen
days
in
britain
and
celebrated
his
triumph
in
this
he
followed
the
precedents
even
to
the
extent
of
ascending
the
steps
of
the
capitol
on
his
knees
with
his
supporting
him
on
each
side
he
granted
to
the
senators
taking
part
with
him
in
the
procession
triumphal
honors
and
this
not
merely
to
the
for
he
was
accustomed
to
do
that
most
lavishly
on
other
occasions
and
with
the
slightest
excuse
upon
rufrius
pollio
the
prefect
he
bestowed
an
image
and
a
seat
in
the
senatorial
body
as
often
as
he
would
enter
that
assembly
with
him
and
to
avoid
having
it
thought
that
he
was
making
any
innovation
he
declared
that
augustus
had
done
this
in
the
case
of
a
certain
valerius
a
ligurian
he
also
increased
the
dignity
of
laco
formerly
præfectus
vigilum
but
now
procurator
of
the
gauls
by
this
same
mark
of
esteem
and
in
addition
by
the
honors
belonging
to
having
finished
this
business
he
held
the
festival
following
the
triumph
and
assumed
for
the
occasion
some
of
the
consular
authority
it
took
place
in
both
the
theatres
at
once
in
the
course
of
the
spectacle
he
would
frequently
absent
himself
while
others
superintended
it
in
his
place
he
had
announced
as
many
as
could
find
place
in
a
day
but
they
amounted
to
not
more
than
ten
altogether
for
between
the
separate
courses
bears
were
slaughtered
and
athletes
struggled
boys
sent
for
from
asia
also
executed
the
pyrrhic
dance
the
performers
in
the
theatre
gave
with
the
consent
of
the
senate
another
festival
likewise
intended
to
commemorate
the
victory
all
this
was
done
on
account
of
the
successes
in
britain
and
to
the
end
that
other
nations
might
more
readily
capitulate
it
was
voted
that
all
the
agreements
which
claudius
or
the
lieutenants
representing
him
should
make
with
any
peoples
should
be
binding
the
same
as
if
sanctioned
by
the
senate
and
the
people
achæa
and
macedonia
which
ever
since
tiberius
became
emperor
had
belonged
to
elected
governors
claudius
now
returned
to
the
choice
by
lot
and
abolishing
the
office
of
prætor
charged
with
the
administration
of
funds
he
put
the
business
in
the
hands
of
quæstors
as
it
had
been
of
old
and
these
were
not
annual
magistrates
as
was
the
case
with
them
previously
and
with
the
prætors
subsequently
but
the
same
two
men
attended
to
their
duties
for
three
entire
years
some
of
these
secured
a
prætorship
immediately
afterward
and
others
drew
a
salary
the
amount
of
which
depended
on
the
impression
of
efficiency
they
had
created
while
in
office
the
quæstors
then
were
given
charge
of
the
treasury
in
place
of
governorships
in
italy
outside
of
the
city
for
he
did
away
with
all
of
the
latter
to
compensate
the
prætors
he
entrusted
to
their
care
several
kinds
of
judicial
cases
which
the
consuls
were
previously
accustomed
to
try
those
serving
as
soldiers
since
by
law
they
could
not
have
wives
were
granted
the
privileges
of
married
men
marcus
julius
cottius
received
an
increase
in
his
ancestral
domain
which
included
the
alps
named
after
him
and
was
now
for
the
first
time
called
king
the
rhodians
were
deprived
of
their
liberty
because
they
had
impaled
certain
romans
and
umbonius
silio
governor
of
bætica
was
summoned
and
ejected
from
the
senate
because
he
had
sent
so
little
grain
to
the
soldiers
then
serving
in
mauretania
at
least
this
was
the
accusation
brought
against
him
in
reality
it
was
not
so
at
all
but
his
treatment
was
due
to
his
having
offended
some
of
the
freedmen
so
he
brought
together
all
his
furniture
considerable
in
amount
and
very
beautiful
in
the
auction
room
as
if
he
were
going
to
call
for
bids
on
all
of
it
but
he
sold
only
his
senatorial
dress
by
this
he
showed
that
he
had
received
no
deadly
blow
and
could
enjoy
life
as
a
private
beside
these
events
of
the
time
the
weekly
market
was
transferred
to
a
different
day
because
of
some
religious
rites
that
happened
too
on
many
other
occasions
following
year
marcus
vinicius
for
the
second
and
statilius
corvinus
for
the
first
time
entered
upon
the
office
of
consul
claudius
himself
took
all
the
customary
oaths
in
detail
but
prevented
the
rest
from
taking
oath
separately
accordingly
as
in
earlier
times
one
man
who
was
a
prætor
and
second
who
was
a
tribune
and
one
each
of
the
other
officials
repeated
the
oaths
for
those
of
the
same
grade
this
custom
was
followed
for
several
years
now
since
the
city
was
becoming
filled
with
numbers
of
images
for
those
who
wished
might
without
restrictions
appear
in
public
in
a
painting
or
in
bronze
or
stone
he
had
most
of
those
already
existing
set
somewhere
else
and
for
the
future
forbade
that
any
private
citizen
be
allowed
to
follow
the
practice
unless
the
senate
should
grant
permission
or
except
he
had
built
or
repaired
some
public
work
such
persons
and
their
relatives
might
have
their
likenesses
set
up
in
the
places
in
question
having
banished
the
governor
of
a
certain
province
for
venality
the
emperor
confiscated
to
public
uses
all
the
extra
funds
that
the
man
had
gathered
in
office
again
to
prevent
these
persons
eluding
those
who
wished
to
bring
them
to
trial
he
would
give
to
nobody
one
office
immediately
after
another
this
had
been
the
custom
in
earlier
days
also
to
the
end
that
any
one
without
difficulty
might
institute
a
suit
against
them
in
the
intervening
period
indeed
those
whose
terms
had
expired
and
who
were
granted
leave
of
absence
from
the
city
might
not
even
take
these
absences
in
succession
since
it
was
intended
that
if
officials
should
be
guilty
of
any
irregularity
they
should
not
gain
the
further
benefit
of
escaping
investigation
by
either
continuous
office
or
continuous
absence
the
custom
had
however
fallen
out
of
use
so
carefully
did
claudius
guard
against
both
possibilities
that
he
would
not
without
out
some
delay
allow
even
an
official
who
was
his
colleague
to
be
chosen
by
lot
for
the
governorship
of
a
province
that
would
naturally
belong
to
him
still
he
allowed
some
of
them
to
govern
for
two
years
and
sometimes
he
would
send
elected
magistrates
persons
who
preferred
a
request
to
leave
italy
for
a
time
were
given
permission
by
claudius
himself
without
action
of
the
senate
yet
in
order
to
appear
to
be
doing
it
under
some
form
of
law
he
ordered
that
a
decree
to
the
effect
be
issued
votes
of
this
sort
were
also
passed
the
following
year
at
the
time
under
consideration
he
arranged
the
votive
festival
which
he
had
promised
in
commemoration
of
his
campaign
to
the
populace
supported
by
public
dole
he
gave
denarii
in
every
case
and
in
some
cases
more
so
that
for
a
few
it
amounted
to
three
hundred
twelve
and
a
half
he
did
not
however
distribute
all
of
it
in
person
but
his
also
took
part
because
the
distribution
lasted
several
days
and
he
was
anxious
to
use
them
in
holding
court
in
the
case
of
the
saturnalia
he
put
back
the
fifth
day
which
had
been
appointed
by
gaius
but
was
later
abolished
and
inasmuch
as
the
sun
was
to
undergo
an
eclipse
on
his
birthday
he
feared
that
some
disturbance
might
result
for
already
certain
other
portents
had
occurred
and
therefore
he
gave
notice
beforehand
not
only
that
there
would
be
an
eclipse
and
when
and
for
how
long
but
also
the
reasons
for
which
this
would
necessarily
take
place
they
are
as
follows
the
moon
which
revolves
lower
down
than
the
sun
or
so
it
is
believed
either
directly
below
him
or
perhaps
with
mercury
and
likewise
venus
intervening
has
a
longitudinal
movement
just
like
him
and
a
higher
and
lower
movement
just
like
him
but
furthermore
a
latitudinal
movement
such
as
nowhere
belongs
to
the
sun
under
any
circumstances
when
therefore
she
gets
in
a
direct
line
with
him
over
our
heads
and
passes
under
his
blaze
then
she
obscures
his
beams
that
extend
toward
the
earth
for
some
to
a
greater
for
some
to
a
less
degree
but
does
not
conceal
his
presence
for
even
the
briefest
moment
for
since
the
sun
has
a
light
of
his
own
he
can
never
surrender
it
and
consequently
when
the
moon
is
not
directly
in
people
way
so
as
to
throw
a
shadow
over
him
he
always
appears
entire
this
then
is
what
happens
to
the
sun
and
it
was
made
public
by
claudius
at
the
time
mentioned
with
regard
to
the
moon
however
for
it
is
not
irrelevant
to
speak
of
lunar
phenomena
also
since
once
i
have
broached
this
subject
as
often
as
she
gets
directly
opposite
the
sun
and
she
only
takes
such
a
position
with
reference
to
him
at
full
moon
whereas
he
takes
it
with
reference
to
her
at
the
season
of
new
moon
a
conical
shadow
falls
upon
the
earth
this
occurs
whenever
in
her
motion
to
and
from
us
her
revolution
takes
her
between
the
sun
and
the
earth
then
she
is
deprived
of
the
sun
light
and
appears
by
herself
just
as
she
really
is
such
are
the
conditions
of
the
case
u
at
the
close
of
that
year
valerius
asiaticus
for
the
second
time
and
also
marcus
silanus
became
consuls
the
latter
held
office
for
the
period
for
which
he
was
elected
asiaticus
however
though
elected
to
serve
for
the
whole
year
as
was
done
in
other
cases
failed
to
do
so
and
resigned
voluntarily
some
others
had
done
this
though
mostly
by
reason
of
poverty
the
expenses
connected
with
the
had
greatly
increased
for
generally
there
was
a
series
of
contests
but
asiaticus
withdrew
simply
by
reason
of
his
wealth
which
also
proved
his
destruction
inasmuch
as
he
was
extremely
and
by
being
consul
a
second
time
had
aroused
the
dislike
and
jealousy
of
many
he
desired
in
a
way
to
overthrow
himself
feeling
that
by
so
doing
he
would
be
less
likely
to
encounter
danger
still
he
was
vinicius
on
the
other
hand
suffered
no
harm
from
claudius
for
though
he
was
an
illustrious
man
he
managed
by
keeping
quiet
and
minding
his
own
business
to
preserve
his
life
but
he
perished
by
poison
administered
by
messalina
she
suspected
that
he
had
killed
his
wife
julia
and
was
angry
because
he
refused
to
have
intercourse
with
her
he
was
duly
accorded
a
public
funeral
and
eulogies
an
honor
which
had
been
granted
to
many
asinius
gallus
of
drusus
by
the
same
mother
conspired
against
claudius
but
instead
of
being
put
to
death
was
banished
the
reason
perhaps
was
that
he
made
ready
no
army
and
collected
no
funds
in
advance
but
was
emboldened
merely
by
his
extreme
folly
which
led
him
to
think
that
the
romans
would
submit
to
having
him
rule
them
on
account
of
his
family
but
the
chief
cause
was
that
he
was
a
very
small
and
unshapely
person
and
was
therefore
held
in
contempt
incurring
ridicule
rather
than
danger
the
people
were
truly
loud
in
praise
of
claudius
for
his
moderation
and
also
by
jupiter
at
the
fact
that
he
showed
displeasure
when
a
certain
man
sought
the
aid
of
the
tribunes
against
the
person
who
had
freed
him
asking
and
securing
thus
a
helper
in
his
cause
both
the
man
in
question
and
those
associated
with
him
in
the
proceedings
were
punished
and
the
emperor
further
forbade
rendering
assistance
to
persons
in
this
way
against
their
former
masters
on
pain
of
being
deprived
of
the
right
to
bring
suit
against
others
per
contra
people
were
vexed
at
seeing
him
so
much
the
slave
of
his
wife
and
freedmen
this
feeling
was
especially
marked
on
an
occasion
when
claudius
himself
and
all
the
rest
were
anxious
to
kill
sabinus
former
governor
of
the
celtæ
in
the
reign
of
gains
in
a
gladiatorial
fight
but
the
latter
approached
messalina
and
she
saved
him
they
were
also
irritated
at
her
having
withdrawn
mnester
from
the
theatre
and
keeping
him
with
her
but
whenever
any
talk
about
his
not
dancing
sprang
up
among
the
people
claudius
would
appear
surprised
and
make
various
apologies
taking
oath
that
he
was
not
at
his
house
the
populace
believing
him
to
be
really
ignorant
of
what
was
going
on
was
grieved
to
think
that
he
alone
was
not
cognizant
of
what
was
being
done
in
the
imperial
apartments
behavior
so
conspicuous
that
news
of
it
had
already
traveled
to
the
enemy
they
were
unwilling
however
to
reveal
to
him
the
state
of
affairs
partly
through
awe
of
messalina
and
partly
to
spare
mnester
for
he
pleased
the
people
as
much
by
his
skill
as
he
did
the
empress
by
his
beauty
with
his
abilities
in
dancing
he
combined
great
cleverness
of
repartee
so
that
once
when
the
crowd
with
mighty
enthusiasm
begged
him
to
perform
a
famous
pantomime
he
dared
to
come
to
the
front
of
the
stage
and
say
to
do
this
friends
i
may
not
try
orestes
bedfellow
am
i
this
then
was
the
relation
of
claudius
to
these
matters
as
the
number
of
lawsuits
was
now
beyond
reckoning
and
persons
summoned
would
now
no
longer
put
in
an
appearance
because
they
expected
to
be
defeated
he
gave
written
notice
that
by
a
given
day
he
should
decide
the
case
against
them
by
default
so
that
they
would
lose
it
even
if
absent
and
there
was
no
deviation
from
this
rule
mithridates
king
of
the
iberians
undertook
to
rebel
and
was
engaged
in
preparations
for
a
war
against
the
romans
his
mother
however
opposed
him
and
since
she
could
not
win
him
over
by
persuasion
determined
to
take
to
flight
he
then
became
anxious
to
conceal
his
project
and
so
while
himself
continuing
preparations
he
sent
his
brother
cotys
on
an
embassy
to
convey
a
friendly
message
to
claudius
but
cotys
proved
a
treacherous
ambassador
and
told
the
emperor
all
and
he
was
made
king
of
iberia
in
place
of
mithridates
u
the
following
year
the
eight
hundredth
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
the
city
of
rome
claudius
became
consul
for
the
fourth
and
lucius
vitellius
for
the
third
time
claudius
now
ejected
some
members
of
the
senate
the
majority
of
whom
were
not
sorry
to
be
driven
out
but
willingly
stood
aside
on
account
of
their
poverty
likewise
he
brought
in
a
number
to
fill
their
places
among
these
he
summoned
with
haste
one
surdinius
gallus
qualified
to
be
a
senator
who
had
emigrated
to
carthage
and
said
to
him
i
will
bind
you
with
golden
fetters
gallus
therefore
fettered
by
his
rank
remained
at
home
although
claudius
visited
dire
punishment
upon
the
freedmen
of
others
in
case
he
caught
them
in
any
crime
he
was
very
lenient
with
his
own
one
day
an
actor
in
the
theatre
uttered
this
saying
a
knave
who
prospers
scarce
can
be
endured
whereupon
the
whole
assemblage
looked
at
polybius
the
freedman
he
undismayed
shouted
out
the
same
poet
however
says
once
were
goatherds
now
have
royal
power
and
suffered
no
harm
for
his
behavior
information
was
laid
that
some
persons
were
plotting
against
claudius
but
in
the
majority
of
instances
he
paid
no
attention
saying
it
does
do
to
adopt
the
same
defensive
tactics
against
a
flea
as
against
a
beast
of
prey
asiaticus
however
was
tried
before
him
and
came
very
near
being
acquitted
he
entered
a
general
denial
declaring
i
have
no
knowledge
of
nor
acquaintance
with
any
of
these
persons
who
are
testifying
against
me
then
the
soldier
who
stated
he
had
been
an
associate
of
his
being
asked
which
one
asiaticus
was
pointed
out
a
baldheaded
man
that
happened
to
be
standing
near
him
baldness
was
the
only
thing
of
which
he
was
sure
about
asiaticus
this
event
occasioned
much
laughter
and
claudius
was
on
the
point
of
freeing
him
when
vitellius
to
please
messalina
made
the
statement
that
he
had
been
sent
for
by
the
prisoner
who
requested
the
privilege
of
deciding
the
manner
of
death
to
be
visited
upon
him
hearing
this
claudius
believed
that
on
account
of
a
guilty
conscience
asiaticus
had
really
condemned
himself
and
accordingly
had
him
executed
among
many
others
who
were
calumniated
by
messalina
he
put
to
death
asiaticus
and
likewise
magnus
his
asiaticus
had
property
and
the
family
of
magnus
as
well
as
his
close
relationship
were
irksome
of
course
they
were
nominally
convicted
on
different
charges
from
these
this
year
a
new
island
not
large
made
its
appearance
by
the
side
of
the
island
thera
claudius
monarch
of
the
romans
published
a
law
to
the
effect
that
no
senator
might
journey
above
seven
from
the
city
without
the
monarch
express
orders
moreover
since
many
persons
would
afford
their
sick
slaves
no
care
but
drove
them
out
of
their
houses
a
law
was
passed
that
all
slaves
surviving
such
an
experience
should
be
free
he
also
prohibited
anybody
driving
through
the
city
sic
seated
in
a
vehicle
vespasian
in
britain
had
been
hemmed
in
by
the
barbarians
and
was
in
danger
of
annihilation
but
his
son
titus
becoming
alarmed
about
his
father
managed
by
unusual
daring
to
break
through
the
enclosing
line
he
then
pursued
and
destroyed
the
fleeing
enemy
plautius
for
his
skillful
handling
of
the
war
with
britain
and
his
successes
in
it
both
received
praise
from
claudius
and
obtained
an
ovation
in
the
course
of
the
armed
combat
of
gladiators
many
foreign
freedmen
and
british
captives
fought
the
number
of
men
receiving
their
finishing
blow
in
this
part
of
the
spectacle
was
large
and
he
took
pride
in
the
fact
gnaeus
domitius
corbulo
as
prætor
in
celtica
organized
the
forces
and
damaged
among
other
barbarians
the
cauchi
as
they
are
commonly
called
while
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
country
he
was
recalled
by
claudius
who
on
ascertaining
his
valor
and
his
discipline
would
not
allow
him
to
climb
to
any
greater
heights
corbulo
learning
this
turned
back
giving
vent
only
to
the
following
exclamation
how
fortunate
were
those
who
became
prætors
in
the
days
of
old
he
implied
that
the
latter
had
been
permitted
to
exhibit
their
prowess
without
danger
whereas
his
progress
had
been
blocked
by
the
emperor
on
account
of
jealousy
yet
even
so
he
obtained
a
triumph
being
again
entrusted
with
an
army
he
trained
it
no
less
thoroughly
and
as
the
nations
were
at
peace
he
had
the
men
dig
a
trench
all
the
way
across
from
the
rhine
to
the
meuse
as
much
as
a
hundred
and
seventy
stadia
long
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
prevent
the
rivers
flowing

a

was

his
daughter
antonia
whom
after
the
death
of
magnus
he
had
given
in
marriage
to
cornelius

he
had
the
good
sense
not
to
allow
any
decree
to
be
passed
in
honor
of
the
occasion
messalina
and
her
freedmen
swelled
with
importance
there
were
three
of
the
latter
in
particular
who
divided
the
ruling
power
among
themselves
callistus
who
had
been
given
charge
of
the
records
of
value
narcissus
who
presided
over
the
letters
and
hence
wore
a
dagger
at
his
belt
and
pallas
to
whom
the
administration
of
funds
had
been
entrusted
messalina
as
if
it
did
not
satisfy
her
to
play
the
adulteress
and
harlot
for
besides
her
usual
shameful
behavior
she
sometimes
carried
on
a
regular
brothel
in
the
palace
serving
as
a
prostitute
herself
and
compelling
women
of
highest
rank
to
do
the
same
now
conceived
a
desire
to
have
many
husbands
that
is
with
the
legal
title
and
she
would
have
entered
upon
a
legal
contract
with
all
those
who
enjoyed
her
favors
had
she
not
been
detected
and
destroyed
in
her
very
first
attempt
for
a
time
all
the
cæesarians
were
on
good
terms
with
her
and
everything
they
did
was
with
one
mind
but
when
she
slandered
and
killed
polybius
after
herself
making
repeated
advances
to
him
they
no
longer
trusted
her
as
a
result
deserted
by
their
she
perished
she
registered
gaius
silius
son
of
the
silius
slain
by
tiberius
as
her
husband
celebrated
the
marriage
in
costly
fashion
bestowed
a
royal
residence
upon
him
and
gathered
in
it
all
the
most
valuable
of
claudius
heirlooms
finally
she
declared
him
consul
now
all
this
though
even
previously
heard
and
seen
by
everybody
else
continued
to
escape
the
notice
of
claudius
so
when
he
went
down
to
ostia
to
inspect
the
grain
supply
and
she
was
left
behind
in
rome
on
the
pretext
of
being
ill
she
got
up
a
banquet
of
no
little
renown
and
carried
on
a
most
licentious
revel
then
narcissus
having
got
claudius
alone
conveyed
to
him
through
the
medium
of
concubines
information
of
all
that
was
taking
place
and
by
frightening
him
with
the
idea
that
messalina
was
going
to
kill
him
also
and
set
up
silius
as
emperor
in
his
place
he
persuaded
him
to
arrest
and
torture
several
persons
the
moment
this
was
done
the
emperor
hastened
back
in
person
to
the
city
and
entering
just
as
he
was
he
put
to
death
mnester
with
many
others
and
then
slew
messalina
after
she
had
retreated
into
the
gardens
of
asiaticus
which
more
than
anything
else
were
the
cause
of
her
ruin
after
her
claudius
destroyed
also
his
own
slave
for
insulting
one
of
the
prominent
men
u
after
a
little
he
married
his
niece
agrippina
mother
of
domitius
who
was
surnamed
nero
she
had
beauty
and
had
been
in
the
habit
of
consulting
him
constantly
and
being
in
his
company
alone
because
he
was
her
uncle
though
she
was
rather
more
free
in
her
conduct
toward
him
than
would
properly
become
a
niece
and
for
this
reason
he
executed
silanus
feeling
that
he
was
plotting
against
him
yet
silanus
was
regarded
as
an
upright
man
and
was
honored
by
claudius
to
the
extent
of
receiving
triumphal
honors
while
still
a
boy
being
betrothed
to
the
daughter
octavia
and
becoming
prætor
long
before
the
age
ordained
he
was
allowed
to
give
the
festival
that
fell
to
his
lot
at
the
expense
of
claudius
and
during
it
the
latter
asked
some
favors
of
him
as
if
he
were
himself
the
mere
head
of
some
party
and
uttered
any
shouts
that
he
saw
other
people
wished
him
to
utter
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
claudius
had
become
such
a
slave
to
the
women
that
on
their
account
he
killed
both
his
on
the
heels
of
this
occurrence
vitellius
came
forward
in
the
senate
with
a
declaration
that
the
good
of
the
state
required
claudius
to
marry
he
indicated
agrippina
as
a
suitable
person
in
this
emergency
and
suggested
that
they
force
him
to
the
marriage
then
the
senators
rose
and
came
to
claudius
and
compelled
him
to
marry
they
also
passed
a
decree
permitting
romans
to
wed
their
nieces
a
union
formerly
prohibited
as
soon
as
agrippina
had
become
settled
in
the
palace
she
gained
complete
control
of
claudius
for
she
possessed
in
an
unusual
degree
the
quality
of
likewise
she
won
the
devotion
of
all
those
who
were
at
all
fond
of
him
partly
by
fear
and
partly
by
benefits
conferred
at
length
she
caused
his
son
britannicus
to
be
brought
up
as
if
he
were
no
relation
of
the
emperor
the
other
child
who
had
betrothed
the
daughter
of
sejanus
was
dead
she
made
domitius
at
this
time
of
claudius
and
later
actually
had
him
adopted
she
accomplished
these
ends
partly
by
causing
the
freedmen
to
persuade
claudius
and
partly
by
seeing
to
it
beforehand
that
the
senate
the
populace
and
the
soldiers
should
always
concur
to
favor
her
demands
this
son
agrippina
was
training
for
the
assumption
of
imperial
office
and
was
having
educated
under
seneca
she
gathered
for
him
an
inconceivable
amount
of
wealth
omitting
not
one
of
the
most
humble
and
least
influential
citizens
in
her
search
for
money
paying
court
to
every
one
who
was
in
the
least
degree
and
murdering
many
for
this
very
reason
in
addition
she
destroyed
out
of
jealousy
some
of
the
foremost
women
and
put
to
death
lollia
paulina
because
the
latter
had
cherished
some
hope
of
being
married
to
claudius
as
she
did
not
recognize
the
woman
head
when
it
was
brought
to
her
she
opened
with
her
own
hand
the
mouth
and
inspected
the
teeth
which
had
certain
peculiarities
mithridates
king
of
the
iberians
was
defeated
in
a
conflict
with
a
roman
army
despairing
of
his
life
he
begged
that
a
hearing
be
granted
him
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
summarily
executed
or
led
in
the
procession
of
triumph
this
right
having
been
accorded
him
claudius
received
him
in
rome
standing
on
a
tribunal
and
addressed
threatening
language
to
him
the
king
throughout
replied
in
an
unabashed
manner
and
concluded
his
remarks
with

you
doubt
it

and

she
sc
agrippina
quickly
became
a
second
messalina
and
chiefly
because
she
obtained
from
the
senate
among
other
honors
the
right
to
use
the
carpentum
at
festivals
u
subsequently
claudius
applied
to
agrippina
the
additional
title
of
when
claudius
had
adopted
her
son
nero
and
had
made
him
his
by
disowning
his
daughter
and
introducing
her
into
another
family
so
that
he
might
not
have
the
name
of
uniting
brother
and
sister
a
mighty
portent
occurred
all
that
day
the
sky
seemed
to
be
on
fire
agrippina
banished
also
calpurnia
one
of
the
most
distinguished
ladies
in
the
land
or
perhaps
even
caused
her
death
as
one
version
of
the
story
reports
because
claudius
had
admired
and
commended
her
beauty
u
when
nero
for
this
is
the
name
for
him
that
has
won
its
way
into
favor
was
registered
among
the
iuvenes
the
day
that
he
was
registered
the
divine
power
shook
the
earth
for
long
distances
and
by
night
struck
terror
to
the
hearts
of
all
men
without
exception
while
nero
was
growing
up
britannicus
received
neither
honor
nor
care
agrippina
indeed
either
drove
away
or
killed
those
who
showed
any
zeal
in
his
behalf
sosibius
to
whom
his
bringing
up
and
education
had
been
entrusted
she
caused
to
be
slain
on
the
pretext
that
he
was
plotting
against
nero
after
that
she
delivered
the
boy
to
the
charge
of
persons
who
suited
her
and
did
him
all
the
harm
she
could
she
would
not
let
him
visit
his
father
nor
appear
before
the
people
but
kept
him
in
a
kind
of
imprisonment
though
without
bonds
dio
book
since
the
prefects
crispinus
and
lusius
veta
would
not
yield
to
her
in
every
matter
she
ousted
them
from
office
no
one
attempted
any
kind
of
reprisal
upon
agrippina
for
to
be
brief
she
had
more
power
than
claudius
himself
and
gave
greetings
in
public
to
those
who
desired
it
this
fact
was
entered
on
the
records
she
possessed
all
powers
since
she
dominated
claudius
and
had
made
sure
of
the
devotion
of
narcissus
and
pallas
callistus
after
rising
to
great
heights
of
influence
was
dead
u
the
astrologers
were
banished
from
the
entire
expanse
of
italy
and
their
disciples
were
punished
carnetacus
a
barbarian
chieftain
who
was
captured
and
brought
to
rome
and
received
his
pardon
at
the
hands
of
claudius
then
after
his
liberation
wandered
about
the
city
and
on
beholding
its
brilliance
and
its
size
he
exclaimed
can
you
who
own
these
things
and
things
like
them
still
yearn
for
our
miserable
tents
claudius
conceived
a
wish
to
have
a
naval
battle
in
a
certain
lake
so
after
building
a
wooden
wall
around
it
and
setting
up
benches
he
gathered
an
enormous
multitude
claudius
and
nero
were
arrayed
in
military
costume
agrippina
wore
a
beautiful
chlamys
woven
with
gold
and
the
rest
of
the
people
whatever
pleased
their
fancy
those
who
were
to
take
part
in
this
were
condemned
criminals
and
each
side
had
fifty
ships
one
party
being
called
rhodians
and
the
other
sicilians
first
they
drew
close
together
and
after
uniting
at
one
spot
they
addressed
claudius
in
this
fashion
salve
imperator
morituri
salutamus
since
this
afforded
them
no
salvation
and
they
were
still
ordered
to
fight
they
used
simple
smashing
tactics
and
took
very
good
care
not
to
harm
each
other
this
went
on
until
they
were
cut
down
by
outside
force
somewhat
later
the
fucinian
lake
caved
in
and
narcissus
was
severely
criticised
for
it
he
presided
over
the
undertaking
and
it
was
thought
that
after
spending
a
great
deal
less
than
he
had
received
he
had
then
purposely
contrived
the
collapse
in
order
that
his
villainy
might
go
undetected
about
narcissus
there
is
a
story
of
how
openly
he
used
to
make
sport
of
claudius
one
day
when
the
latter
was
holding
court
the
bithynians
raised
a
great
outcry
against
junius
cilo
their
governor
because
as
they
asserted
he
had
taken
very
considerable
bribes
claudius
not
understanding
on
account
of
their
noise
asked
the
bystanders
what
they
were
saying
thereupon
instead
of
telling
him
the
truth
narcissus
said
they
are
expressing
their
gratitude
to
junius
claudius
believing
him
rejoined
why
he
shall
have
charge
of
them
two
years
more
agrippina
often
attended
her
husband
in
public
when
he
was
transacting
ordinary
business
or
when
he
was
hearing
ambassadors
she
sat
upon
a
separate
platform
this
was
surely
one
of
the
most
remarkable
sights
of
the
time
on
one
occasion
when
a
certain
orator
julius
gallicus
was
pleading
a
case
claudius
grew
vexed
and
ordered
that
he
be
cast
into
the
tiber
near
the
banks
of
which
he
chanced
to
be
holding
court
domitius
afer
who
as
an
advocate
had
the
greatest
ability
of
his
contemporaries
made
a
very
neat
joke
on
this
a
man
whom
gallicus
had
disappointed
came
to
domitius
for
assistance
whereupon
the
latter
said
to
him
and
who
told
you
i
could
swim
better
than
he
can
later
claudius
fell
sick
and
nero
entered
the
senate
to
promise
a
in
case
claudius
should
regain
his
health
agrippina
was
leaving
no
stone
unturned
to
make
him
popular
with
the
masses
and
to
cause
him
to
be
regarded
as
the
only
natural
successor
to
the
imperial
throne
hence
it
was
that
she
selected
the
equestrian
contest
on
which
they
doted
especially
for
nero
to
promise
in
the
event
of
recovery
an
outcome
against
which
she
sincerely
prayed
again
after
instigating
a
riot
over
the
sale
of
bread
she
persuaded
claudius
to
make
known
to
the
populace
by
public
bulletin
and
to
write
to
the
senate
that
if
he
should
die
nero
was
fully
capable
of
administering
public
interests
in
consequence
of
this
he
became
a
power
and
his
name
was
on
everybody
lips
whereas
in
regard
to
britannicus
numbers
did
not
know
of
his
existence
and
all
others
regarded
him
as
idiotic
and
epileptic
for
this
was
the
declaration
that
agrippina
gave
well
claudius
became
convalescent
and
nero
conducted
the
in
a
sumptuous
manner
now
too
he
married
octavia
a
new
circumstance
to
cause
him
a
feeling
of
manly
dignity
nothing
seemed
to
satisfy
agrippina
though
all
rights
which
livia
had
possessed
were
bestowed
upon
her
also
and
a
number
of
additional
honors
had
been
decreed
she
wielding
equal
power
with
claudius
desired
to
have
his
title
outright
and
once
when
a
blaze
had
spread
over
the
city
to
a
considerable
distance
she
accompanied
him
in
the
work
of
rescue
u
claudius
was
irritated
by
agrippina
actions
of
which
he
now
began
to
become
aware
and
sought
to
find
his
son
britannicus
the
boy
however
was
purposely
kept
out
of
his
sight
by
the
empress
most
of
the
time
for
she
was
doing
everything
conceivable
to
secure
the
right
of
succession
for
nero
since
he
was
her
own
son
by
her
former
husband
domitius
claudius
who
displayed
his
affection
whenever
he
met
britannicus
was
not
disposed
to
endure
her
behavior
and
made
preparations
to
put
an
end
to
her
power
to
register
his
son
among
the
iuvenes
and
appoint
him
as
heir
to
the
empire
this
news
alarmed
agrippina
who
decided
to
anticipate
the
project
by
poisoning
him
since
however
by
reason
of
the
great
quantity
of
wine
he
was
forever
drinking
and
his
general
habits
of
life
which
all
emperors
adopt
for
their
protection
he
could
not
easily
be
harmed
she
sent
for
a
named
lucusta
a
recent
captive
renowned
for
the
desired
skill
and
obtaining
from
her
a
poison
whose
effect
was
sure
she
put
it
in
one
of
the
vegetables
called
mushrooms
then
she
herself
ate
of
the
others
in
the
dish
but
made
her
husband
eat
the
one
which
had
the
poison
for
it
was
the
largest
and
finest
of
them
the
victim
of
this
plot
was
carried
out
of
the
banquet
apparently
quite
overcome
by
strong
drink
but
that
had
happened
many
times
before
during
the
night
the
poison
took
effect
and
he
passed
away
without
having
been
able
to
say
or
hear
a
word
it
was
the
thirteenth
of
october
and
he
had
lived
years
two
months
and
thirteen
days
having
been
emperor
thirteen
years
eight
months
and
twenty
days
agrippina
rapid
vengeance
had
been
aided
by
the
fact
that
before
her
attempt
she
had
despatched
narcissus
to
campania
feigning
that
he
needed
to
take
the
waters
there
for
his
gout
had
he
been
present
she
would
never
have
done
the
deed
such
extreme
care
did
he
take
of
his
master
his
death
followed
hard
upon
that
of
claudius
and
he
left
behind
him
a
reputation
for
power
unequaled
by
any
man
of
that
age
his
property
amounted
to
more
than
ten
thousand
myriads
and
cities
and
kings
were
dependent
upon
him
even
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
being
slain
he
managed
to
execute
a
brilliant
coup
he
had
charge
of
the
correspondence
of
claudius
and
had
in
his
possession
letters
containing
secret
information
against
agrippina
and
others
all
of
these
he
burned
before
his
death
and
he
was
slain
beside
the
tomb
of
messalina
a
coincidence
manifestly
intended
by
chance
to
satisfy
her
vengeance
in
such
fashion
did
claudius
meet
his
end
it
seemed
that
indications
of
this
event
were
given
in
advance
by
the
comet
star
which
was
seen
over
a
wide
expanse
of
territory
by
the
shower
of
blood
by
the
bolt
that
descended
upon
the
standards
of
the
