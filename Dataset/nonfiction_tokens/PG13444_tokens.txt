knowledge

the
old
maxim
that
knowledge

is
a
true
one
but
there
is
still
a
greater
truth
knowledge
is
safety
safety
amid

that
beset
mankind
and
safety
amid
the
moral
pitfalls
that
surround
so
many
young
people
is
the
great
crying
demand
of
the
age
this
work
though
plain
and
to
some
extent
startling
is
chaste
practical
and
to
the
point
and
will
be
a
boon
and
a
blessing
to
thousands
who
consult

science

thrown

on
many
facts
relating

the
physiology
of
man

woman
and
the
diseases
to
which
they
are
subject
and
consequently
many
reformations
have
taken
place
in
the
treatment

prevention
of
diseases

any
information
bearing
upon
the

of
mankind
should
not

key
the
physician
is
frequently
called
upon
to
speak
in
plain
language
to
his
patients
upon
some
private
and
startling
disease
contracted
on
account
of
ignorance
the
better
plan
however
is
to
so
educate
and
enlighten
old
and
young
upon
the
important
subjects
of
health
so
that
the
necessity
to
call
a
physician
may
occur
less
frequently
a
large
respectable
though
diminishing
class
in
every
community
maintain
that
nothing
that
relates
exclusively
to
either
sex
should
become
the
subject
of
popular
medical
instruction
but
such
an
opinion
is
radically
wrong
ignorance
is
no
more
the
mother
of
purity
than
it
is
of
religion
enlightenment
can
never
work
injustice
to
him
who
investigates
an
the
men
and
women
who
study
and
practice
medicine
are
not
the
worse
but
the
better
for
such
knowledge
so
it
would
be
to
the
community
in
general
if
all
would
be
properly
instructed
on
the
laws
of
health
which
relate
to
the
sexes
crime
and
had
every
person
a
sound
understanding
on
the
relation
of
the
sexes
one
of
the
most
fertile
sources
of
crime
and
degradation
would
be
removed
physicians
know
too
well
what
sad
consequences
are
constantly
occurring
from

lack
of

commended
itself
to

to
this

an
interest

excitement
unfelt
perhaps
at
any

the
growth

hitherto
life
has
been

to

a
dependent
existence
a
sucker
from
the

growth
a

discipline

authority

guidance
and
communicated

but
henceforth
it
is
a
transplanted
growth
of
its
own
a
new
and
free
power
of
activity
in
which
the
mainspring
is
no
longer

without

transferred

of
its
own
impulse
and
character
it
must
take
root
and
grow
into
strength
or
sink
into
weakness

vice

the
thought
of
home
must
excite
a
pang
even
in
the
first
moments
of
freedom
its
glad
shelter
its
kindly
guidance
its
very
restraints
how
dear
and
tender
must
they
seem
in
parting
how
brightly
must
they
shine
in
the
retrospect
as
the
youth
turns
from
them
to
the
hardened
and
unfamiliar
face
of
the
world
with
what
a
sweet
pathos
they
must
linger
in
the
memory
and
then
what
chance
and
hazard
is
there
in
his
freedom
what
instincts
of
warning
in
its
very
novelty
and
dim
inexperience
what
possibilities
of
failure
as
well
as
of
success
in
the
unknown
future
as
it
stretches
before
him
vice
or
certainly
there
is
a
grave
importance
as
well
as
a
pleasant
charm
in
the
beginning
of
life
there
is
awe
as
well
as
excitement
in
it

rightly
viewed
the
possibilities
that
lie
in
it
of
noble
or
ignoble
work
of
happy
or
ruinous

capacities

which
it

heights
of

abuse

the
depths

the
crisis
one

well
as
of
hope

sadness
as

as

or
it
is
wistful
as
well
as
pleasing
to
think
of
the
young
passing
year
by
year
into
the
world
and
engaging
with
its
duties
its
interests
and
temptations
of
the
throng
that
struggle
at
the
gates
of
entrance
how
many
may
reach
their
anticipated
goal
carry
the
mind
forward
a
few
years
and
some
have
climbed
the
hills

difficulty
and
gained
the
eminence
on
which
they
wished
to
stand

although
they
may
not
have
done
this

kept
their
truth
unhurt

integrity
unspoiled

turned
back
or
have
perished
by
the
way
or
fallen
in
weakness
of
will
no
more
to
rise
again
victims
or
their
own
sin
as
we
place
ourselves
with
the
young
at
the
opening
gates
of
life
and
think
of
the
end
from
the
beginning
it
is
a
deep
concern
more
than
anything
else
that
fills
us
words
of
earnest
argument
and
warning
counsel
rather
than
of
congratulation
rise
to
our
lips
mistakes
are
often
begin
well
and
the
habit
of
doing
well
will
become
quite
as
easy
as
the
habit
of
doing
badly
well
begun
is
half
ended
says
the
proverb
and
a
good
beginning
is
half
the
battle
many
promising
young
men
have
irretrievably
injured
themselves
by
a
first
false
step
at
the
commencement
of
life
while
others
of
much
less
promising
talents
have
succeeded
simply
by
beginning
well
and
going
onward
the
good
practical
beginning
is
to
a
certain
extent
a
pledge
a
promise
and
an
assurance
of
the
ultimate
prosperous
issue
there
is
many
a
poor
creature
now
crawling
through
life
miserable
himself
and
the
cause
of
sorrow
to
others
who
might
have
lifted
up
his
head
and
prospered
if
instead
of
merely
satisfying
himself
with
resolutions
of
he
had
actually
gone
to
work
and
made
a
good
practical
beginning
begin
at
the
right
too
many
are
however
impatient
of
results
they
are
not
satisfied
to
begin
where
their
fathers
did
but
where
they
left
off
they
think
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
industry
without
working
for
them
they
can
not
wait
for
the
results
of
labor
and
application
but
forestall
them
by
too
early
indulgence
health
a
duty
perhaps
nothing
will
so
much
hasten
the
time
when
body
and
mind
will
both
be
adequately
cared
for
as
a
diffusion
of
the
belief
that
the
preservation
of
health
is
a
duty
few
seem
conscious
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
physical
morality
men
habitual
words
and
acts
imply
that
they
are
at
liberty
to
treat
their
bodies
as
they
please
disorder
entailed
by
disobedience
to
nature
dictates
they
regard
as
grievances
not
as
the
effects
of
a
conduct
more
or
less
flagitious
though
the
evil
consequences
inflicted
on
their
descendents
and
on
future
generations
are
often
as
great
as
those
caused
by
crime
they
do
not
think
themselves
in
any
degree
criminal
it
is
true
that
in
the
case
of
drunkenness
the
viciousness
of
a
bodily
transgression
is
recognized
but
none
appear
to
infer
that
if
this
bodily
transgression
is
vicious
so
too
is
every
bodily
transgression
the
fact
is
all
breaches
of
the
law
of
health
are
physical
sins
when
this
is
generally
seen
then
and
perhaps
not
till
then
will
the
physical
training
of
the
young
receive
all
the
attention
it
deserves
purity
of
life
and
thought
should
be
taught
in
the
home
it
is
the
only
safeguard
of
the
young
let
parents
wake
up
on
this
important
subject
illustration
gladstone
value
of

who

the
who

oh

impoverishes

deforms

degrades
and
all
the
arts
the
decorations
and
accomplishments
of
life
stand
like
the
upon

rock
warning
the
world
that
its
approach
is
dangerous
that
its

is
death
the
wretch
without
the
wretch
without
it
is
under
eternal
quarantine
no
friend
to
greet
no
home
to
harbor
him
the
voyage
of
his

becomes
a
joyless
peril
and
in
the
midst
of
all
ambition
can
achieve
or
avarice
amass
or
rapacity
plunder
he
tosses
on
the
surge
a
buoyant
pestilence
but
let
me
not
degrade
into
selfishness
of
individual
safety
or
individual
exposure
this
individual
principle
it
testifies
a
higher
a
more
ennobling
origin
its
oh
divine
oh
delightful
legacy
of

spotless
reputation
rich
is
the
inheritance
it
leaves

the
example
it
testifies
pure
precious
and
imperishable
the
hope
which
it
inspires
can
there
be
conceived
a
more
atrocious
injury
than
to
filch
from
its
possessor
this
inestimable
benefit
to
rob
society
of
its
charm
and
solitude
of
its
solace
not
only
to
life
but
attain
death
converting
the
very
grave
the
refuge
of
the
sufferer
into
the
gate
of
infamy
and
of
shame
lost

studying
that
which
is
called
a
good
name
we
must
ask
the
large
human
race
to
tell
us
the
high
merit
of
this
spiritual
longing
we
must
read
the
words
of
the
sage
who
said
long
centuries
ago
that
a
good
name
was
rather
chosen
than
great
riches
other
sages
have
said
as
much
solon
said
that
he
that
will
sell
his
good
name
will
sell
the
state

said
fame
is
the
perfume
of
heroic
deeds

influences
of
our
our
age
is
deeply
influenced
by
the
motives
called
property
and
home
and
pleasure
but
it
is
a
question
whether
the
generation
in
action
today
and
the
generation
on
the
threshold
of
this
intense
life
are
conscious
fully
of
the
worth
of
an
honorable
name
beauty
of
we
do
not
know
whether
with
us
all
a
good
name
is
less
sweet
than
it
was
with
our
fathers
but
this
is
painfully
evident
that
our
times
do
not
sufficiently
behold
the
beauty
of
character
their
sense
does
not
detect
quickly
enough
or
love
deeply
enough
this
aroma
of
heroic
deeds
selling
out
their
it
is
amazing
what
multitudes
there
are
who
are
willing
to
sell
out
their
reputation
and
amazing
at
what
a
low
price
they
will
make
the
painful
exchange
some
king
remarked
that
he
would
not
tell
a
lie
for
any
reward
less
than
an
empire
it
is
not
uncommon
in
our
world
for
a
man
to
sell
out
all
his
honor
and
hopes
for
a
score
or
a
half
score
of
dollars
prisons
our
prisons
are
all
full
to
overflowing
of
those
who
took
no
thought
of
honor
they
have
not
waited
for
an
empire
to
be
offered
them
before
they
would
violate
the
sacred
rights
of
man
but
many
of
them
have
even
murdered
for
a
cause
that
would
not
have
justified
even
an
exchange
of
words
integrity
the
pride
of
the
if
integrity
were
made
the
pride
of
the

the
love
of
it
would
soon
spring
up
among
the
people
if
all
fraudulent
men
should
go
straight
to
jail
pitilessly
and
if
all
the
most
rigid
characters
were
sought
out
for
all
political
and
commercial
offices
there
would
soon
come
a

where

may
we
expect
from
such

an
issue

letter

more
talent
than
to
solve
with
your
pen
a
profound
problem
in
philosophy
lovers
must
not
then
expect
much
from
each
other
epistles
ladies

gentlemen
who
correspond
with
each

should
never
be
guilty
of
exposing
any
of
the
contents

any
letters
written
expressing
confidence
attachment
or

the
man
who
confides
in
a
lady
and
honors
her
with
his
confidence
should
be
treated
with
perfect
security
and
respect
and
those
who
delight
in

their
confidential

to

are
unworthy
heartless

how
to

letter
has
been
no
doubt
the
problem
of

fancy
the
youth
of

america
with
lifted
pen
thinking
how
he
shall
address
his

much
depends
upon
this
letter
what
shall
he
say
and
how
shall
he
say
it
is
the
great
question
perseverance
however
will
solve
the
problem
and
determine

has
first
called
you
my
dear
or
has
given
you
to
understand
that
such
familiar
terms
are
permissible
as
a
rule
a
gentleman
will
never
err
if
he
says
dear
miss
nellie
and
if
the
letters
are
cordially
reciprocated
the
miss
may
in
time
be
omitted
or
other
familiar
terms
used
instead
in
addressing
a
widow
dear
madam
or
my
dear
madam
will
be
a
proper
form
until
sufficient
intimacy
will
justify
the
use
of
other
terms
a
lady
must
always
be
treated
with
respectful
delicacy
and
a
gentleman
should
never
use
the
term
dear
or
my
dear
under
any
circumstances
unless
he
knows
it
is
perfectly
acceptable

a
long
and
friendly
acquaintance

upon
the

of

it
is
difficult
to
see
any
phrase
which
could
be
added
to
them
which
would
carry
more
meaning
than
they
contain
people
can
sign
themselves
adorers

such
like
but
they
do
so
at
the
peril
of
good
taste
it
is
not
good
that
men
or
women
worship
each
other
if
they
succeed
in
preserving
reciprocal
love
and
esteem
they
will
have
cause

write
i
am
heartily
glad
you
are
going
to
be
married
and
congratulate
you
upon
the
wisdom
of
your
choice
you
have
won
a
noble
as
well
as
a
beautiful
woman
and
one
whose
love
will
make
you
a
happy
man
to
your
life
end
may
god
grant
that
trouble
may
not
come
near
you
but
should
it
be
your
lot
you
will
have
a
wife
to
whom
you
can
look
with
confidence
for
comfort
and
whose
good
sense

devotion
to
you

your
sure
and
unfailing
support
that
you
may
both
be
very
happy
and
that
your
happiness
may
increase
with
your
years
is
the
prayer
of
your
friend
frank
howard
letter
writing
any
extravagant
flattery
should
be
avoided
both
as
tending
to
disgust
those
to
whom
it
is
addressed
as
well
as
to
degrade
the
writers
and
to
create
suspicion
as
to
their
sincerity
the
sentiments
should
spring
from
the
tenderness
of
the
heart
and
when
faithfully
and
delicately
expressed
will
never
be
read
without
exciting
sympathy
or
emotion
in
all
hearts
not
absolutely
deadened
by
insensibility
declaration
of
affection
dear
nellie
will
you
allow
me
in
a
few
plain
and
simple
words
respectfully
to
express
the
sincere
esteem
and
affection
i
entertain
for
you
and
to
ask
whether
i
may
venture
to
hope
that
these
sentiments
are
returned
i
love
you
truly
and
earnestly
and
knowing
you
admire
frankness
and
candor
in
all
things
i
can
not
think
that
you
will
take
offense
at
this
letter
perhaps
it
is
to
suppose
i
have
any
place
in
your
regard
should
this
be
so
the
error
will
carry
with
it
its
own
punishment
for
my
happy
dream
will
be
over
i
will
try
to
think
otherwise
however
and
shall
await
your
answer
with
hope
trusting
soon
to
hear
from

i

i

i
have
loved
you
from
the
very
first
day
we
met
and
always
shall
do
you
blame
me
because
i

leave
my

behind

your

need
not
place
a
guard
over

it

impossible
that
it

the

while
i

i
have
no

of

ah
if
there
were
truth
in
clairvoyance
would
i
be
with
you
at
this
moment
i
wonder
if
you
are
as
impatient
to
see
me
as
i
am

it

is
so
deep

powerful
that
i
can
not
forbear
writing
to
you
in
defiance
of
all

affection
is

after

my

was
no

my

i
have
not
the
assurance
to

fortunate
enough
to
create
any
interest
in

will
you
allow

that
is

can
not

even
by

the

i
have
possessed
of
observing
the
thousand
acts
of
amiability
and
kindness
which
mark
the
daily
tenor
of
your

have
ripened
my
feelings
of
affectionate
regard
into
a
passion
at
once
ardent
and
sincere
until
i
have
at
length
associated
my
hopes
of
future
happiness
with
the
idea
of
you
as
a
life
partner
in
them
believe
me

of
person

it
is

it

me
great
pain
and
upon
which
silence

you

me
you

apparently
forgotten
what
is
due

me
circumstanced
as
we
are
thus
far
at

you
can
not
suppose
that
i

tamely
see
you
disregard
my
feelings
by
conduct
toward
other
ladies
from
which
i
should
naturally
have
the
right
to
expect
you
to
abstain
i
am

vulgar
a
person
as
to
be
jealous
when
there
is
cause
to
infer
changed
feelings
or
unfaithfulness
to
promises
of
constancy
jealousy
is
not
the
remedy
what
the
remedy
is
i
need
not
say
we
both
of
us
have
it
in
our
hands
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
we
must
come
to
some
understanding
by
which
the
future
shall

governed

nor

can

as

prediscovery

is
superior
in

the
better
before
introducing
a
gentleman
to
a
lady
remember
that
she
is

to
hold
you
responsible

the

the

is

expressions
should

something
similar
is
expected
do
not
extend
the
hand
usually
a
true
lady
will
avoid
familiarity

gentlemen

to

should

make
a
medium
bow
neither
too
decided
nor
too
slight
or
stiff
for
a
gentleman
to
take
a
young
lady
arm
is
to
intimate
that
she
is
feeble
and
young

resent
the
mode
if
a
young
lady
desires
to
visit
any
public

she

to

there

who
devote

to

by

they
become
devoted

with
such
exclusiveness
that
all
social

is
irksome
they
go
out
to
tea
as
if
they
were
going
to
jail
and
drag
themselves
to

as

this

going
where
you

always

men
who
affect
your
unhealthy
minds
with
antipathy
will
prove
themselves
very
frequently
to
be
your
best

most
delightful
companions
because
a
man
seems
uncongenial
to
you
who
are
squeamish
and
foolish
you
have
no
right
to
shun
him
we
become
charitable
by
knowing
men
we
learn
to
love
those
whom
we
have
despised
by
rubbing
against
them
do
you
not
remember
some
instance
of
meeting
a
man
or
woman
whom
you
had
never
previously
known
or
cared
to
know
an
individual
perhaps
against
whom
you
have
entertained
the
strongest
prejudices
but
to
whom
you
became
bound
by
a
lifelong
friendship
through
the
influence
of
a
three
days
intercourse
yet
if
you
had
not
thus
met
you
would
have
carried
through
life
the
idea
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
you
to
give
your
fellowship
to
such
an
individual
the
foolishness
of
god
has
introduced
into
human
character
infinite
variety
and
for
you
to
say
that
you
do
not
love
and
will
not
associate
with
a
man
because
he
is
unlike
you
is
not
only
foolish
but
wrong
you
are
to
remember
that
in
the
precise
manner
and
decree
in
which
a
man
differs
from
you
do
you
differ
from
him
and
that
from
his
standpoint
you
are
naturally
as
repulsive
to
him
as
he
from
your
standpoint
is
to
you
so
leave
all
this
talk
of
congeniality
to

politeness
beautiful
politeness
has
been
described
as
the
art
of
showing
by
external
signs
the
internal
regard
we
have
for
others
but
one
may
be
perfectly
polite
to
another
without
necessarily
paying
a
special
regard
for
him
good
manners
are
neither
more
nor

than
beautiful
behavior
it
has
been
well
said
that
a
beautiful

is
better
than
a
beautiful
face

a
beautiful
behavior
is
better

it

a

pleasure
than
statues
or

it

the

the

comes
of

it
must
be
the
outcome

or
it
will
make
no

impression

no

polish
can
dispense

the

to

itself

a
man

respect
the

if
he
wishes
to
be
respected
himself
he
will
have
due
regard
for
his
views
and
opinions
even
though
they
differ
from
his
own
the
man
pays
a
compliment
to
another
and
sometimes
even
secures
his
respect
by
patiently
listening
to
him
he
is
simply
tolerant
and
forbearant
and
refrains
from
judging
harshly
and
harsh
judgments
of

will
almost
invariably
provoke
harsh
judgments
of
ourselves
the
the

man
will
however
sometimes
rather
lose
his

by
the
absence

or
by
indulging

the

at

are
impolite
not

they

because
they

shyness
is

people
of
the
teutonic
race
from
all
that
can
be
learned
of
shakespeare
it
is
to
be
inferred
that
he
was
an
exceedingly
shy
man
the
manner
in
which
his

were

it
is
not

he
edited

authorized

publication

the
dates
at
which

appeared

evinced

rockwell
says
of
him
in

he
never
forgets
others
for

he
said
to
me
there
is
a
poor
soldier

who
came
to
me
before
this
thing
occurred

i
promised
her

should
be

bright
we
have
thus
far
spoken
of
shyness
as
a
defect
but
there
is
another
way
of
looking
at
it
for
even
shyness
has
its
bright
side
and
contains
an
element
of
good
shy
men
and
shy
races
are
ungraceful
and
undemonstrative
because
as
regards
society
at
large
they
are
comparatively
unsociable
they
do
not
possess
those
elegancies
of
manner
acquired
by
free
intercourse
which
distinguish
the
social
races
because
their
tendency
is
to
shun
society
rather
than
to
seek
it
they
are
shy
in
the
presence
of
strangers
and
shy
even
in
their
own
families
they
hide
their
affections
under
a
robe
of
reserve
and
when
they
do
give
way
to
their
feelings
it
is
only
in
some
very
hidden
inner
chamber
and
yet
the
feelings
are
there
and
not
the
less
healthy
and
genuine
though
they
are
not
made
the
subject
of
exhibition
to
others
worthy
of

therefore
grace
of
manner
politeness
of
behavior
elegance
of
demeanor
and
all
the
arts
that
contribute
to
make
life
pleasant
and
beautiful
are
worthy
of
cultivation
it
must
not
be
at
the
expense
of
the
more
solid
and
enduring
qualities
of
honesty
sincerity
and
truthfulness
the
fountain
of
beauty
must
be
in
the
heart
more
than
in
the
eye
and
if
it
does
not
tend
to
produce
beautiful
life
and
noble
practice
it
will
prove
of
comparatively
little
avail
politeness
of
manner
is
not
worth
much
unless
it
is
accompanied
by
polite

beauty
in

rail
at

it
is
a

their

neglect
the
culture

their

or
the
claims
of
others
on

service
who
care
more
for
their
dress
than
their
disposition
who
are
troubled
more
by
an
unfashionable
bonnet
than
a
neglected
duty
simplicity
of
female
lovliness
never
appears
to
so
good
advantage
as
when
set
off
by
simplicity
of
dress
no
artist
ever
decks
his
angels
with
towering
feathers
and
gaudy
jewelry
and
our
dear
human
angels

they
would
make
good
their
title
to
that
name
should
carefully
avoid
ornaments
which
properly
belong

in

there
is
no
substitute
for
the
charm
of
simplicity
a
vulgar
taste
is
not
to
be
disguised
by
gold
or
diamonds
the
absence
of

taste
and
refinement
of

can
not
be
compensated
for
by
the

the

the

is
lost

antiquity
the
figures
of
the
early
egyptian
women
show
clearly
an
artificial
shape
of
the
waist
produced
by
some
style
of

a
similar
style
of

find
the

was
used
in
france

england
as
early
as
the

the
most
extensive
and
extreme
use
of
the
corset
occurred
in
the
century
during
the
reign
of
catherine
de
medici
of
france
and
queen
elizabeth
of
england
with
catherine
de
medici
a
waist
measurement
was
considered
the
standard
of
fashion
while
a
thick
waist
was
an
abomination
no
lady
could
consider
her
figure
of
proper
shape
unless
she
could
span
her
waist
with
her
two
hands
to
produce
this
result
a
strong
rigid
corset
was
worn
night
and

until
the

was

during
the
century
corsets
were
largely
made
from
a
species
of
leather
known
as
bend
which
was
not

that
used
for

for
a
time
there
was
a
return
to
the
early
classical
greek
costume
this
style
of
dress
prevailed
with
various
modifications
until
about
when
corsets
and
tight

again
returned
with
threefold
fury
buchan
a
prominent
writer
of
this

says
that
it

down
upon

placing
her
foot
upon
her
back
break
half
a
dozen

her
stays
it
is
reserved
to
our
own

to
demonstrate
that
corsets
and
tight
lacing
do
not
necessarily
go
hand

not

a
proper
proportion
should
exist
between
the
size
of
the
waist
and
the
breadth
of
the
shoulders
and
hips
and
if
the
waist
is
diminished
below
this
proportion
it
suggests
disproportion
and
invalidism
rather
than
grace
and
beauty
the
perfect
corset
is
one
which
possesses
just
that
degree
of
rigidity
which
will
prevent
it
from
wrinkling
but
will
at
the
same
time
allow
freedom
in
the
bending

about
seven
years

an
article
was
discovered
for
the
stiffening
of
corsets
which
has
revolutionized
the
corset
industry
of
the
world
this
article
is
manufactured
from
the
natural
fibers
of
the
mexican
ixtle
plant
and
is
known
as
coraline
it
consists
of
straight
stiff
fibers
like
bristles
bound
together
into
a
cord
by
being
wound
with
two
strands
of
thread
passing
in
opposite
directions
this
produces
an
elastic
fiber
intermediate
in
stiffness
between
twine
and
whalebone
it
can
not
break
but
it
possesses
all
the
stiffness
and
flexibility
necessary
to
hold
the
corset
in

prevent
its
wrinkling

with

with

mentally
he
is
a

he
stands

above
the
masses
because
morally
he
is
far
beyond
suspicion
in
his

word

because
his

manly
consecrated
life
is
a
mighty
power

there
always
has

be
unhappy

learn
what

means
how

overtaxed

her
happiness
which
is
largely
dependent
upon

health
is
destroyed

give
the

they
marry
the
undivided
love
of
their

constancy
is
the
of
a
life

speaks
eloquently
of
clean

in

strengthen

marriage
continue

what

love
in

women
naturally
love
courage
force

firmness
in
men
the
ideal
man
in
a
woman
eye
must
be
heroic
and
brave
woman
naturally
despises
a
coward
and
she
has
little
or
no
respect
for
a
bashful
man
woman
naturally
loves
her
lord
and
master
women
who
desperately
object
to
be
overruled
nevertheless
admire
men
who
overrule
them
and
few
women
would
have
any
respect
for
a
man
whom
they
could
completely
rule
and
control
man
is
naturally
the
protector
of
woman
as
the
male
wild
animal
of
the
forest
protects
the
female
so
it
is
natural
for
man
to
protect
his
wife
and
children
and
therefore
woman
admires
those
qualities
in
a
man
which
make
him
a
protector
large
women
naturally
love
men
of
strength
size

fine

a
short
small

a
woman
always
pities
a
weakly

rarely
ever
has
any
love
for
him
small

all
men
would
be
of
good
size
in

it
not
for
the
infirmities
visited
upon
them
by
the
indiscretion
of
parents

there
are
many
children

vigorous
who
destroy
the
full
vigor
of
their
generative
organs
in
youth
by
and
if
they
survive
and
marry
their
children
will
have
small
bones
small
frames
and
sickly
constitutions
it
is
therefore
not
strange
that
instinct
should
lead
women
to
admire
men
not
touched
with
these
symptoms
of
physical
debility
woman
generally
loves
a
generous
man
religion
absorbs
a
great
amount
of
money
in
temples
churches
ministerial
salaries
and
ambition
and
appetite
absorb
countless

yet
woman
receives
more
gifts
from
man
than
all
these
combined
she
loves
a
generous
giver
and
are
the
jewels
which
she
most
admires
a
woman
receiving
presents
from
a
man
implies
that
she
will
pay
him
back

and
the
woman
who
accepts
a

not
respect
him
commits
a
wrong
which
is
rarely
ever
forgiven
above
all
other

this
character
in

is
illustrated
by
an
english
army
officer
as
told
by
fowler
betrothed
in

to
a
beautiful
loving
heiress
summoned
to
india
who
wrote
back

her
i
have
lost
an

a

an

been
so
badly
marred

begrimmed
besides
that
you
never
could
love
this
poor
maimed

yet
i
love
you
too
well
to
make
your

wretched
by
requiring
you
to
keep
your
with
me
from
which
i
hereby

you
find
among

one
physically
more

you
can

she
answered
as
all
genuine
women
must
answer
your
noble
mind
your
splendid
talents
your
martial
prowess
which
maimed
you
are
what
i
love
as
long
as
you
retain
sufficient
body
to
contain
the

which
alone
is
what
i
admire
i
love
you
all

long
to
make

mine
forever
soft
all
women
despise
soft
and
silly
men
more
than
all
other
defects
in
their
character
woman
never
can
love
a
man
whose
conversation
is
flat
and
insipid
every
man
seeking
appreciation
or
love
should
always
endeavor
to
show
his
intelligence
and
manifest
an
interest
in
books
and
daily
papers
he
should
read
books
and
inform
himself
so
that
he
can
talk
intelligently
upon
the
various
topics
of
the
day
even
an
ignorant
woman
always
loves
superior
intelligence
sexual
women
love
sexual
vigor
in
men
this
is
human
nature
weakly
and
delicate
fathers
have
weak
and
puny
children
though
the
mother
may
be
strong
and
robust
a
weak
mother
often
bears
strong
children
if
the
father
is
physically
and
sexually
vigorous
consumption
is
often
inherited
from
fathers
because
they
furnish
the
body
yet
more
women
die
with
it
because
of
female
obstructions
hence
women
love
passion
in
men
because
it
endows
their
offspring
with
strong
functional
vigor
passionate
men
the
less
passion
any
woman
possesses
the
more
she
prizes
a
strong
passionate
man
this
is
a
natural
consequence
for
if
she
married
one
equally
passionless
their
children
would
be
poorly
endowed
or
they
would
have
none
she
therefore
admires
him
who
makes
up
the
deficiency
hence
very
amorous
men
prefer
quiet
modest
and
reserved
women
homely
men
are
admired
by
women
if
they
are
large
strong
and
vigorous
and
possess
a
good
degree

are
trifles

of
young

remember
what
you
read
so
you
can

do
not

naturally
admire
genteel
and
intelligent
discussions
and
conversations
when
there
is
someone
to
talk
with
who
has
an
opinion
of
his

despises
a

who
has
no

she
hates
a

admires
leadership
original

looks

the
soldier
figures
as

it
is
said
by
good
authority
that
a
man
in
uniform
has
three
more
chances
to
marry
than
the
man
without
uniform
the
correct
reason
is
the
soldier
profession
is
bravery
and
he
is
dressed
and
trained
for
that
purpose
and
it
is
that
which
makes
him
admired
by

rather
than
the
uniform
which
he
wears
his

also
that
of

beauty
is
the
highest
type
of
all
beauty
a
handsome
woman
needs
no
diamonds
no
silks
or
satins
her
brilliant
face
outshines
diamonds
and
her
form
is
beautiful
in
calico
false
man
love
of
female
beauty
surpasses
all
other
love
and
whatever
artificial
means
are
used
to
beautify
to
a
certain
extent
are
falsehoods
which
lead
to
distrust
or
dislike
artificial
beauty
is
always
an
imitation
and
never
can
come
into
competition
with
the
genuine
no
art
can
successfully
imitate
nature
true
kind
of
facial
beauty
is
only
skin
deep
a
beautiful
form
a
graceful
figure
graceful
movements
and
a
kind
heart
are
the
strongest
charms
in
the
perfection
of
female
beauty
a
brilliant
face
always
outshines
what
may
be
called
a
pretty
face
for
intelligence
is
that
queenly

which
crowns
woman
influence
over

good

awaken
a

love
for

a

must
therefore
be
charming
as
well
as
beautiful
for
a
charming
girl
will
never
become
a
charmless
wife
a
good
female
no
weakly
woman
can
draw
a
love
like
a
strong
well
developed
body
a
round
plump
figure
with
an
overflow
of
animal
life
is
the
woman
most
commonly
sought
for
nature
in
man
craves
for
the
strong
qualities
in
women
as
the
health
and
life
of
offspring
depend
upon
the
physical
qualities
of
wife
and
mother
a
good
body
and
vigorous
health
therefore
become
indispensable
to
female
beauty
broad
a
woman
with
a
large
pelvis
gives
her
a
superior
and
significant
appearance
while
a
narrow
pelvis
always
indicate
weak
sexuality
the
other
portions
of
the
body
however
must
be
in
harmony
with
the
size
and
breadth
of
the
hips
full
in
the
female
beauty
of
physical
development
there
is
nothing
that
can
equal
full
breasts
it
is
an
indication
of
good
health
and
good
maternal
qualities
as
a
face
looks
bad
without
a
nose
so
the
female
breast
when
narrow
and
flat
produces
a
bad
effect
the
female
breasts
are
the
means
on
which
a
child
depends
for
its
life
and
growth
hence
it
is
an
essential
human
instinct
for
men
to
admire
those
physical
proportions
in
women
which
indicate
perfect
motherhood
cotton
and
all
other
false
forms
simply
show
the
value
of
natural
ones
all
false
forms
are
easily
detected
because
large
natural
ones
will
generally
quiver
and
move
at
every
step
while
the
artificial
ones
will
manifest
no
expression
of
life
as
woman
looks
so
much
better
with
artificial
paddings
and
puffings
than
she
does
without
therefore
modern
society
should
waive
all
objections
to
their
use
a
full
breast
has
been
man
admiration
through
all
climes
and
ages
and
whether
this
instinct
is
right
or
wrong
sensible
or
sensual
it
is
a
fact
well
known
to
all
that
it
is
a
great
disappointment
to
a
husband
and
father
to
see
his
child
brought
up
on
a
bottle
men
love
full
breasts
because
it
promotes
maternity
if
however
the
breasts
are
abnormally
large
it
indicates
maternal
deficiency
the
same
as
any
disproportion
or
extreme
small
small
feet
and
small
ankles
are
very
attractive
because
they
are
in
harmony
with
a
perfect
female
form
and
men
admire
perfection
small
feet
and
ankles
indicate
modesty
and
reserve
while
large
feet
and
ankles
indicate
coarseness
physical
power
authority
predominance
feet
and
ankles
however
must
be
in
harmony
with
the
body
as
small
feet
and
small
ankles
on
a
large
woman
would
be
out
of
proportion
and
consequently
not
beautiful
beautiful
as
the
arm
is
always
in
proportion
with
the
other
portions
of
the
body
consequently
a
arm
small
hands
and
small
wrists
with
full
muscular
development
is
a
charm
and
beauty
not
inferior
to
the
face
itself
and
those
who
have
arms
may
be
proud
of
them
because
they
generally
keep
company
with
a
fine
bust
and
a
fine
figure
a
mother
must
naturally
possess
intelligence
in
order
to
rear
her
children
intelligently
consequently
it
is
natural
for
man
to
chiefly
admire
mental
qualities
in
women
for
utility
and
practicability
depend
upon
intelligence
therefore
a
man
generally
loves
those
charms
in
women
which
prepare
her
for
the
duties
of
companionship
if
a
woman
desires
to
be
loved
she
must
cultivate
her
intellectual
gifts
be
interesting
and
entertaining
in
society
and
practical
and
helpful
in
the
home
for
these
are
some
of
the
qualifications
which
make
up
the
highest
type
of
beauty
piety
and
religion
in
men
who
love
home
and
the
companionship
of
their
wives
love
truth
honor
and
honesty
it
is
this
higher
moral
development
that
naturally
leads
them
to
admire
women
of
moral
and
religious
natures
it
is
therefore
not
strange
that
immoral
men
love
moral
and
wives
man
naturally
admires
the
qualities
which
tend
to
the
correct
government
of
the
home
men
want
good
and
pure
children
and
it
is
natural
to
select
women
who
insure
domestic
contentment
and
happiness
a
bad
man
of
course
does
not
deserve
a
good
wife
yet
he
will
do
his
utmost
to
get
one
false

love
reserved
coy
and

much
more
than

false

false

false

more

twenty

seldom
if
ever
marry
a
man
of
thirty

over
because
the
love
of
an
elderly
man
for
a

is
more
parental
than
conjugal
while
hers
for
him
is
like
that
of
a

to
a
father
he
may
pet
flatter
and
indulge
her
as
he
would

all
this

is
that
they

adapted
to
each
other

the
pelvis
that
part
of
the
anatomy
containing
all
the
internal
organs
of
gestation
is
not
only
essential
to
beauty
and
symmetry
but
is
a
matter
of
vital
importance
to
her
who
contemplates
matrimony
and
its
usual
consequences
therefore
the
woman
with
a
very
narrow
and
contracted
pelvis
should
never
choose
a
man
of
giant
physical
development
lest
they
can
not
duly
realize
the
most
important
of
the
enjoyments
of
the
marriage
state
while
the
birth
of
large
infants
will
impose
upon
her

it

should
suffer
from

the
breaking

love
that

sometimes
allowed

crucify

there
is
no

that
the
suffering
from
disappointed

is
often
deeper

more

then
the

i
will
just
remark
that
good
size
is
important
in
wives

mothers
a
small
stature
is
objectionable
in
a
woman
because
little
women
usually
have
too
much
activity

their
strength

consequently
feeble
constitutions
hence
they
die

besides
being

extremely

she
is

for
it
is
on
the

footing
with
marrying
for
money
marry
a
man
for
his
merit
and
you
take
no
chances
marry
to
please
no
one
but
marriage
is
a
matter
exclusively
your
own
because
you
alone
must
abide
its
consequences
no
person
not
even
a
parent
has
the
least
right
to
interfere
or
dictate
in
this
matter

may

should

are
mostly
to
be
blamed
for
these
elopements
their
children
marry
partly
out
of
sprite
and
to
be
contrary
their
very
natures
tell
them
that
this
interference
is
unjust
as
it
really
is
and
this
excites
combativeness
firmness
and
in
combination
with
the
social
faculties
to
powerful
and
even
blind
resistance
which
turmoil
of
the
faculties
hastens
the
match
let
the
affections
of
a
daughter
be
once
slightly
enlisted
in
your
favor
and
then
let
the
old
folks
start
an
opposition
and
you
may
feel
sure
of
your
prize
if
she
did
not
love
you
before
she
will
now
that
you
are
persecuted
never
disinherit
or
threaten
to
disinherit
a
child
for
marrying
against
your
will
if
you
wish
a
daughter
not
to
marry
a
certain
man
oppose
her
and
she
will
be
sure
to
marry
him
so
also
in
reference
to
a
son
proper
the
secret
is
however
all
in
a
nutshell
let
the
father
properly
train
his
daughter
and
she
will
bring
her
first
to
him
and
give
him
an
opportunity
to
cherish
a
suitable
affection
and
to
nip
an
improper
one
in
the
germ
before
it
has
time
to
do
any
harm
the
fatal
mistakes
of

however
one
way
of
effectually
preventing
an
improper
match
and
that
is
not
to
allow
your
children
to
associate
with
any
whom
you
are
unwilling
they
should

how
cruel
as

to
allow

to

kindles
up
the
fires
of

into
the

flames

burning
licentiousness
which
burn
out
every
element

destroy

thereby
finally
destroys
it

at

unbridled

an
utter

reversing

against

and
those
of

is
the
most

direction
of

a
tenderness
a
purity
and
unreservedness
an
exquisiteness
a
devotedness
and
a
poetry
belonging

like
life
has
no
second
spring
though
a
second
attachment
may
be
accompanied
by

feeling
and
to
a
devotedness
to
the
object
loved

let

be
checked

blighted
in
its
first
pure
emotion
and
the
beauty
of
its
spring
is
irrecoverably
withered
and
lost
this
does
not
mean
the
simple
love
of

call

take

him

who
entertained
not
one
spark
of

for
her

whose

were
bestowed

absurd
how
preposterous

doctrine
that
the
obligations
of

their
sacredness

all
that
she
holds
dear
on
earth
to
root
up
and
pull
out
her
imbedded
affections
and
to
tear
her
from
her
rightful
husband
first
love
is
always
constant
the
second
love
brings
uncertainty
too
often
desertions
before
marriage
and
divorces
after
marriage
the
the
young
woman
to
play
the
coquet
and
sport
with
the
sincere
affections
of
an
honest
and
devoted
young
man
is
one
of
the
highest
crimes
that
human
nature
can
commit
better
murder
him
in
body
too
as
she
does
in
soul
and
morals
and
it
is
the
result
of
previous
disappointment
never
the
outcome
of
a
sincere
first
love
one
marriage
one
evidence
that
second
marriages
are
contrary
to
the
laws
of
our
social
nature
is
the
fact
that
almost
all
and
disagree
now
what
law
has
been
broken
to
induce
this
penalty
the
law
of
marriage
and
this
is
one
of
the
ways
in
which
the
breach
punishes
itself
it
is
much
more
in
accordance
with
our
natural
feelings
especially
those
of
mothers
that
children
should
be
brought
up
by
their
own
parent
second
another
proof
of
this
point
is
that
second
marriage
is
more
a
matter
of
business
i
give
you
a
home
if
you
take
care
of
my
children
it
a
bargain
is
the
way
most
second
matches
are
made
there
is
little
of
the
poetry
of
and
little
of
the
coyness
and
shrinking
diffidence
which
characterize
the
first
attachment
still
these
remarks
apply
almost
equally
to
a
second
attachment
as
to
second
marriage
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
let
this
portion
be
read
and
pondered

also
the
one

first
love

possible

cause
of

exists

is
aggravated
by
aristocratic
parents

nothing

it

the

to

which
the
children
of
men
habitually
obey
however
they
may
disagree
on
other
subjects
all
are
in
accord
on
this
the
barbarous
the
civilized
the
high
the
low
the
fierce
the
gentle
all
unite
in
the
desire
which
finds
its
accomplishment
in
the
reproduction
of
their
kind
who
shall
quarrel
with
the
divinely
implanted
instinct
or
declare
it
to
be
vulgar
or
unmentionable
it
is
during
the
period
of
the
honeymoon
that
the
intensity
of
this
desire
coupled
with
the
greatest
curiosity
is
at
its
height
and
the
unbridled
license
often
given
the
passions
at
this
time
is
attended
with
the
most
dangerous
consequences
consummation
of
the
first
time
that
the
husband
and
wife
cohabit
together
after
the
ceremony
has
been
performed
is
called
the
consummation
of
marriage
many
grave
errors
have
been
committed
by
people
in
this
when
one
or
both
of
the
contracting
parties
were
not
physically
or
sexually
in
a
condition
to
carry
out
the
marriage
relation
a
marriage
however
is
complete
without
this
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
as
it
is
a
maxim
taken
from
the
roman
civil
statutes
that
consent
not
cohabitation
is
the
binding
element
in
the
ceremony
yet
in
most
states
of
the
and
in
some
other
countries
marriage
is
legally
declared
void
and
of
no
effect
where
it
is
not
possible
to
consummate
the
marriage
relation
a
divorce
may
be
obtained
provided
the
injured
party
begins
the
suit
test
of
the
consummation
of
marriage
with
a
virgin
is
not
necessarily
attended
with
a
flow
of
blood
and
the
absence
of
this
sign
is
not
the
slightest
presumption
against
her
former
chastity
the
true
test
of
virginity
is
modesty
void
of
any
disagreeable
familiarity
a
sincere
christian
faith
is
one
of
the
best
recommendations
let
every
man
remember
that
the
legal
right
of
marriage
does
not
carry
with
it
the
moral
right
to
injure
for
life
the
loving
companion
he
has
chosen
ignorance
may
be
the
cause
but
every
man
before
he
marries
should
know
something
of
the
physiology
and
the
laws
of
health
and
we
here
give
some
information
which
is
of
very
great
importance
to
every
man
lust
crucifies
love
the
young
sensual
husband
is
generally
at
fault
passion
sways
and
the
duty
to
bride
and
wife
is
not
thought
of
and
so
a
modest
young
wife
is
often
actually
forced
and
assaulted
by
the
unsympathetic
haste
of
her
husband
an
amorous
man
in
that
way
soon
destroys
his
own
love
and
thus
is
laid
the
foundation
for
many
difficulties
that
soon
develop
trouble
and
disturb
the
happiness
of
both
abuse
after
usually
marriage
is
consummated
within
a
day
or
two
after
the
ceremony
but
this
is
gross
injustice
to
the
bride
in
most
cases
she
is
nervous
timid
and
exhausted
by
the
duties
of
preparation
for
the
wedding
and
in
no
way
in
a
condition
either
in
body
or
mind
for
the
vital
change
which
the
married
relation
bring
upon
her
many
a
young
husband
often
lays
the
foundation
of
many
diseases
of
the
womb
and
of
the
nervous
system
in
gratifying
his
unchecked
passions
without
a
proper
regard
for
his
wife
exhausted
condition
the
first
conjugal
approaches
are
usually
painful
to
the
new
wife
and
no
enjoyment
to
her
follows
great
caution
and
kindness
should
be
exercised
a
young
couple
rushing
together
in
their
animal
passion
soon
produce
a
nervous
and
irritating
condition
which
ere
long
brings
apathy
indifference
if
not
dislike
true
love
and
a
high
regard
for
each
other
will
temper
passion
into
moderation
were
the
above
injunctions
heeded
fully
and
literally
it
would
be
folly
to
say
more
but
this
would
be
omitting
all
account
of
the
bridegroom
new
position
the
power
of
his
passion
and
the
timidity
of
the
fair
creature
who
is
wondering
what
fate
has
in
store
for
her
trembling
modesty
to
be
sure
there
are
some
women
who
are
possessed
of
more
forward
natures
and
stronger
desires
than
others
in
such
cases
there
may
be
less
trouble
a
common
the
young
husband
may
have
read
in
some
treatise
on
physiology
that
the
hymen
in
a
virgin
is
the
great
obstacle
to
be
overcome
he
is
apt
to
conclude
that
this
is
all
that
some
force
will
be
needed
to
break
it
down
and
that
therefore
an
amount
of
urgency
even
to
the
degree
of
inflicting
considerable
pain
is
justifiable
this
is
usually
wrong
it
rarely
constitutes
any
obstruction
and
even
when
its
rupturing
may
be
necessary
it
alone
seldom
causes
suffering
there
are
sometimes
certain
deformities
of
the
vagina
but
no
woman
should
knowingly
seek
matrimonial
relations
when
thus
afflicted
we
quote
from
huff
the
following
what
is
it
then
that
usually
causes
distress
to
many
women
whether
a
bride
or
a
wife
the
answer
is
simply
those
conditions
of
the
organs
in
which
they
are
not
properly
prepared
by
anticipation
and
desire
to
receive
a
foreign
body
the
modest
one
craves
only
refined
and
platonic
love
at
first
and
if
husbands
new
and
old
would
only
realize
this
plain
truth
would
cease
and
the
happiness
of
each
one
of
all
human
pairs
vastly
increase
the
conditions
of
the
female
organs
depend
upon
the
state
of
the
mind
just
as
much
as
in
the
case
of
the
husband
the
male
however
being
more
sensual
is
more
quickly
roused
she
is
far
less
often
or
early
ready
in
its
unexcited
state
the
vagina
is
lax
its
walls
are
closed
together
and
their
surfaces
covered
by
but
little
lubricating
secretion
the
chaster
one
of
the
pair
has
no
desire
that
this
sacred
vestibule
to
the
great
arcana
of
procreation
shall
be
immediately
and
roughly
invaded
this
then
is
the
time
for
all
approaches
by
the
husband
to
be
of
the
most
delicate
considerate
and
refined
description
possible
the
quietest
and
softest
demeanor
with
gentle
and
words
are
all
that
should
be
attempted
at
first
the
wedding
day
has
probably
been
one
of
fatigue
and
it
is
foolish
to
go
farther
for
more
than
one
night
it
will
be
wise
indeed
if
the
confidence
shall
be
as
much
wooed
and
won
by
patient
delicate
and
prolonged
courting
as
before
the
marriage
engagement
how
long
should
this
period
of
waiting
be
can
only
be
decided
by
the
circumstances
of
any
case
the
bride
will
ultimately
deny
no
favor
which
is
sought
with
full
deference
to
her
modesty
and
in
connection
with
which
bestiality
is
not
exhibited
her
nature
is
that
of
delicacy
her
affection
is
of
a
refined
character
if
the
love
and
conduct
offered
to
her
are
a
careful
effort
to
adapt
roughness
and
strength
to
her
refinement
and
weakness
her
admiration
and
responsive
love
will
be
excited
to
the
utmost
when
that
moment
arrives
when
the
bride
finds
she
can
repose
perfect
confidence
in
the
kindness
of
her
husband
that
his
love
is
not
purely
animal
and
that
no
violence
will
be
attempted
the
power
of
her
affection
for
him
will
surely
assert
itself
the
mind
will
act
on
those
organs
which
nature
has
endowed
to
fulfil
the
law
of
her
being
the
walls
of
the
vagina
will
expand
and
the
glands
at
the
entrance
will
be
fully
lubricated
by
a
secretion
of
mucous
which
renders
congress
a
matter
of
comparative
ease
when
this
responsive
enlargement
and
lubrication
are
fully
realized
it
is
made
plain
why
the
haste
and
force
so
common
to
first
and
subsequent
coition
is
as
it
has
been
justly
called
nothing
but
legalized

your

as
a

that
the
ignorance

to

is
the
most

how
a

can
safely
arrive
at

while
this

terminate

no

very
much
better
for

the

where
people
are
reasonably
temperate
no
such
ordinary
precautions
as

undermine

the

open

all

absurdities

be
carefully
avoided
many
of
the
female
disorders
which
often
revenge
themselves
in
the
cessation
of
all
sexual
pleasure
are
largely
due
to
the
excessive
practice
of
sexual
indulgence
some
writers
claim
that
intercourse
should
never
occur
except
for
the
purpose
of
childbearing
but
such
restraint
is
not
natural
and
consequently
not
conducive
to
health
there
are
many
conditions
in
which
the
health
of
the
mother
and
offspring
must
be
respected
it
is
now
held
that
it
is
nearer
a
crime
than
a
virtue
to

the
degradation
of
breeding

be
properly
cared
for
and
educated
in
this
work
we
shall
attempt
to
specify
no
rule
but
simply
give
advice
as
to
the
health
and
happiness
of
both
man
and
wife
a
man
should
not
gratify
his
own
desires
at
the
expense
of
his
health
comfort
or
inclination
many
men
no
doubt
harass
their
wives
and
force
many
burdens
upon
their
slender
constitutions
but
it
is
a
great
sin
and
no
true
husband
will
demand
unreasonable
recognition
the
wife
when
physically
able
however
should
bear
with
her
husband
man
is
naturally
sensitive
on
this
subject
and
it
takes
but
little
to
alienate
his
affections
and
bring
discover
into
the
family
the
best
writers
lay
down
the
rule
for
the
government
of
the
that
sexual
indulgence
should
only
occur
about
once
in
a
week
or
ten
days
and
this
of
course
applies
only
to
those
who
enjoy
a
fair
degree
of
health
but
it
is

one

the

may
be

which

are
some

which
are

simple
principles

her

says
i

have
that
man
she
plies

and
secures
for
herself
a
life

sorrow

disappointment

perhaps
in
a
broken
up

an
early
grave
any
prudent
intelligent
person
of
mature
age
might
have
warned

cautioned

she
sought
no

accepted
no
admonition

may
pursue
a

course
with

disastrous
results

marriages
are
undoubtedly
arranged

what
may
be
termed
the

themselves
to
those
whom
they
never

have
selected
as
their
companions
in

they
had
wider
opportunities
of
acquaintance
within
the
borders

their
limited
circle
they
make
a
selection
which
may
be
wise
or
may
be
unwise
they
have
no
means
of

allow
no
one

the
results
are
sometimes
happy

sometimes
unhappy

extreme
it
is
well
to
act
cautiously
in
doing
what
can
be

it

are
liable
to
imbibe
the
opinion
that
they
are
better
fitted
for

than
any
other
two

in

this
may
be
the
case
or
it
may
not
be
there
are
a
thousand
chances
against
such

in
favor

even
if
at

these

jealousy
is
an
accidental
passion
for
which
the
faculty
indeed
is
unborn
in
its
nobler
form
and
in
its
nobler
motives
it
arises
from
love
and
in
its
lower
form
it
arises
from
the
deepest
and
darkest
pit
of
satan
how
jealousy
arises
either
from
weakness
which
from
a
sense
of
its
own
want
of
lovable
qualities
is
not
convinced
of
being
sure
of
its
cause
or
from
distrust
which
thinks
the
beloved
person
capable
of
infidelity
sometimes
all
these
motives
may
act
together
noblest
the
noblest
jealousy
if
the
term
noble
is
appropriate
is
a
sort
of
ambition
or
pride
of
the
loving
person
who
feels
it
is
an
insult
that
another
one
should
assume
it
as
possible
to
supplant
his
love
or
it
is
the
highest
degree
of
devotion
which
sees
a
declaration
of
its
object
in
the
foreign
invasion
as
it
were
of
his
own
altar
jealousy
is
always
a
sign
that
a
little
more
wisdom
might
adorn
the
individual
without
harm
the
lowest
the
lowest
species
of
jealousy
is
a
sort
of
avarice
of
envy
which
without
being
capable
of
love
at
least
wishes
to
possess
the
object
of
its
jealousy
alone
by
the
one
party
assuming
a
sort
of
property
right
over
the
other
this
jealousy
which
might
be
called
the
satanic
is
generally
to
be
found
with
old
withered
husbands
whom
the
devil
has
prompted
to
marry
young
women
and
who
forthwith
dream
night
and
day
of
horns
these
keepers
are
no
longer
capable
of
any
feeling
that
could
be
called
love
they
are
rather
as
a
rule
heartless
and
are
in
constant
dread
that
some
one
may
admire
or
appreciate
his
unfortunate
slave
want
of
the
general
conclusion
will
be
that
jealousy
is
more
the
result
of
wrong
conditions
which
cause
uncongenial
unions
and
which
through
moral
corruption
artificially
create
distrust
than
a
necessary
accompaniment
of
love
illustration
seeking
the
life
of
a
rival
result
of
poor
jealousy
is
a
passion
with
which
those
are
most
afflicted
who
are
the
least
worthy
of
love
an
innocent
maiden
who
enters
marriage
will
not
dream
of
getting
jealous
but
all
her
innocence
can
not
secure
her
against
the
jealousy
of
her
husband
if
he
has
been
a
libertine
those
are
wont
to
be
the
most
jealous
who
have
the
consciousness
that
they
themselves
are
most
deserving
of
jealousy
most
men
in
consequence
of
their
present
education
and
corruption
have
so
poor
an
opinion
not
only
of
the
male
but
even
of
the
female
sex
that
they
believe
every
woman
at
every
moment
capable
of
what
they
themselves
have
looked
for
among
all
and
have
found
among
the
most
unfortunate
the
prostitutes
no
libertine
can
believe
in
the
purity
of
woman
it
is
contrary
to
nature
a
libertine
therefore
can
not
believe
in
the
loyalty
of
a
faithful
wife
when
there
may
be
occasions
where
jealousy
is
justifiable
if
a
woman
confidence
has
been
shaken
in
her

or
a
husband
confidence
has
been
shaken
in
his

by
certain
signs

conduct
which
have
no

then
there
is

there
must
however
be

proof
as
evidence
of
the

immoral
conduct
imaginations

any
foolish
absurdities
should
have
no

whatever

been

by
the
revelation

no

should
allow
their
associations
to
develop
into
an
engagement

marriage
if
either
one
has
any
inclination
to
jealousy
it
shows
invariably
a
want
of
sufficient
confidence
and
that
want
of
confidence
instead
of
being
diminished
after
marriage
is
liable
to
increase
until
by
the
aid
of
the
imagination
and
wrong
interpretation
the
home
is
made
a
hell
and
divorce
a
necessity
let
it

there
can

without
perfect
and
absolute
confidence
jealousy
is
always
the

are
the
parents

morally
when

stamp
their
own
image

upon
progeny
so
will
be
the

thus
momentous

how
many

tread
this

completely

almost

ignorantly
as
brutes
entailing
even
loathsome

this
great
law
of

hereditary
descent
fully
proves

illustrates
in
any
required
number
and

cases
showing
that

inherits
the
constitutional
natures

of

indeed
who
can

as
palpable
as
that

inherit

some
therefore
all
the

of

tubercles
have
been
found
in
the

of

at

born
of

a
proof
clear
and
demonstrative
that
children
inherit
the
several
states
of
parental
physiology
existing
at
the
time
they
received
their
physiological
constitution
the
same
is
true
of
the
transmission
of
those
diseases
consequent
on
the
violation
of
the
law
of
chastity
and
the
same
conclusion
established
thereby
parent
each
parent
furnishing
at
indispensable
portion
of
the
materials
of
life
and
somehow
or
other
contributes
parentally
to
the
formation
of
the
constitutional
character
of
their
joint
product
appears
far
more
reasonable
than
to
ascribe
as
many
do
the
whole
to
either
some
to
paternity
others
to
maternity
still
this
decision
go
which
way
it
may
does
not
affect
the
great
fact
that
children
inherit
both
the
physiology
and
the
mentality
existing
in
parents
at
the
time
they
received
being
and
constitution
illegitimates
or
bastards
also
furnish
strong
proof
of
the
correctness
of
this
our
leading
doctrine
they
are

witty
frolicksome
knowing
quiet
of

full
of

feeling

are

calculated

though
in
general
sadly
deficient
in
some
essential
moral
elements
character
of
wherein
then
consists
this
difference
first
in
novelty
lending
an
enchantment
rarely
experienced
in
sated
wedlock
as
well
as
in
power
of
passion
sufficient
to
break
through
all
restraint
external
and
internal
and
hence
their
high
wrought
organization
they
are
usually
wary
and
on
the
alert
and
their
parents
drank
stolen
waters
they
are
commonly
wanting
in
moral
balance
or
else
delinquent
in
some
important
moral
aspect
nor
would
they
have
ever
been
born
unless
this
had
been
the
case
for
the
time
being
at
least
with
their
parents
behold
in
these
and
many
other
respects
easily
cited
how
striking
the
coincidence
between
their
characters
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
those
parental
conditions
necessarily
attendant
on
their
origin
children
condition
depends
upon
parents
condition
at
the
time
of
the
sexual
embrace
let
parents
recall
as
nearly
as
may
be
their
circumstances
and
states
of
body
and
mind
at
this
period
and
place
them
by
the
side
of
the
physical
and
mental
constitutions
of
their
children
and
then
say
whether
this
law
is
not
a
great
practical
truth
and
if
so
its
importance
is
as
the
happiness
and
misery
it
is
capable
of
affecting
the
application
of
this
mighty
engine
of
good
or
evil
to
mankind
to
the
promotion
of
human
advancement
is
the
great
question
which
should
profoundly
interest
all
parents
the
vital
the
physical
condition
of
parents
at
the
vital
period
of
transmission
of
life
should
be
a
perfect
condition
of
health
in
both
body
and
mind
and
a
vigorous
condition
of
all
the
animal
organs
and
functions
muscular
especially
should
parents
cultivate
their
muscular
system
preparatory
to
the
perfection
of
this
function
and
of
their
children
because
to
impart
strength
and
stamina
to
offspring
they
must
of
necessity
both
possess
a
good
muscular
organization
and
also
bring
it
into
vigorous
requisition
at
this
period
for
this
reason
if
for
no
other
let
those
of
sedentary
habits
cultivate
muscular
energy
preparatory
to
this
time
of
need
the
so
exceedingly
delicate
are
the
seeds
of
life
that
unless
planted
in
a
place
of
perfect
security
they
must
all
be
destroyed
and
our
race
itself
extinguished
and
what
place
is
as
secure
as
that
chosen
where
they
can
be
reached
only
with
the
utmost
difficulty
and
than
only
as
the
peril
of
even

in

ground

a
sickly
harvest
healthy
people
most
the
most

have
the
most
numerous

but
that
as
luxury
enervates

it
diminishes
the

preferring
none
rather
than

debility

nature
seems
to
rebel
against

why
children
inquire
whether
one
or
both
the
parents
of
those
numerous
children
that
die
around

have
not

no
but
their
is
born
in

with

and
by

agency
take
statistics
in
august
and
then
say
whether
most
of
the
deaths
of
children
are
not
caused
by
indigestion
or
feebleness
of
the
bowels
liver
or
complaints
growing
out

rather
take
family
statistics
from
parents
and
yet
in
general
those
very
parents
who
thus
suffer
more
than
words
can
tell
were
the
first
and
main
transgressors
because
they
entailed
those
dyspeptic
heart
and
other
kindred
affections
so
common
among
american
parents
upon
their
own
children
and
thereby
almost
as
bad
as
killed
them
by
inches
thus
depriving
them
of
the
joys
of
life
and
themselves
of
their
greatest
earthly
treasure
all
children
may
children
may
indeed
die
whose
parents
are
healthy
but
they
almost
must
whose
parents
are
essentially
ailing
in
one
or
more
of
their
vital
organs
because
since
they
inherit
this
organ
debilitated
or
diseased
any
additional
cause
of
sickness
attacks
this
part
first
and
when
it
gives
out
all
go
by
the
board
together
parents
must
learn
and
how
infinitely
more
virtuous
and
happy
would
your
children
be
if
you
should
be
healthy
in
body
and
happy
in
mind
so
as
to
beget
in
them
a
constitutionally
healthy
and
vigorous
physiology
along
with
a
serene
and
happy
frame
of

words

utterly
powerless

and
so
is
everything
but
a
lifetime
of
consequent
happiness
or
misery
learn
and
obey
then
the
laws
of
life
and
health
that
you
may
both
reap
the
rich
reward
yourself
and
also
shower
down
upon
your
children
after
you
blessings
many
and
most
exalted
avoid
excesses
of
all
kinds
be
temperate
take
good
care
of
the
body
and
avoid
exposures
and
disease
and
your
children
will
be
models
of
health
and
beauty
the
right
the
great
practical
inference
is
that
those
parents
who
desire
intellectual
and
moral
children
must
love
each
other
because
this
love
besides
perpetually
calling
forth
and
cultivating
their
higher
faculties
awakens
them
to
the
highest
pitch
of
exalted
action
in
that
climax
concentration
and
consummation
of
love
which
propagates
their
existing
qualities
the
mental
endowment
of
offspring
being
proportionate
to
the
purity
and
intensity
of
parental
love
the
the
children
of
affectionate
parents
receive
existence
and
constitution
when
love
has
rendered
the
mentality
of
their
parents
both
more
elevated
and
more
active
than
it
is
by
nature
of
course
the
children
of
loving
parents
are
both
more
intellectual
and
moral
by
nature
than
their
parents
now
if
these
children
and
their
companions
also
love
one
another
this
same
law
which
renders
the
second
generation
better
than
the
first
will
of
course
render
the
third
still
better
than
the
second
and
thus
of
all
succeeding
generations
animal
you
may
preach
and
pray
till
doomsday
may
send
out
missionaries
may
circulate
tracts
and
bibles
and
multiply
revivals
and
all
the
means
of
grace
with
little
avail
because
as
long
as
mankind
go
on
as
now
to
propagate
by
animal
impulse
so
long
must
their
offspring
be
animal
sensual
devilish
but
only
induce
parents
cordially
to
love
each
other
and
you
thereby
render
their
children
constitutionally
talented
and
virtuous
oh
parents
by
as
much
as
you
prefer
the
luxuries
of
concord
to
the
torments
of
discord

this

the

when
another

the

under

children

wrong
no
one
hesitates
to
declare
that
if
is
want
of
and
morality
which
brings
wrong
results
outside
of
marriage
but
it
is
also
the
want
of
them
which
begets
evil
inside

there
is
nothing
more

than
to
find
the

on

in

organs
with
certain

for

etc
all
the
different
stages
of
development
can
be
easily
determined
but
how
and
why
life
takes
place
under
such
special
condition
and
under
no
other
is
an
unsolved
mystery
the
ovaries
are
the
essential
parts
of
the
generative
system
of
the
human
female
in
which
ova
are
matured
there
are
two
ovaries
one
on
each
side
of
the
uterus
and
connected
with
it
by
the
fallopian
tubes
they
are
about
an
inch
in
diameter
and
furnish
the
germs
or
ovules
these
germs
or
ovules
are
very
small
measuring
about
of
an
inch
in
diameter
the
ovaries
develop
with
the
growth
of
the
female
so
that
finally
at
the
period
of
puberty
they
ripen
and
liberate
an
ovum
or
germ
vesicle
which
is
carried
into
the
uterine
cavity
of
the
fallopian
tubes
by
the
aid
of
the
microscope
we
find
that
these
ova
are
composed
of
granular
substance
in
which
is
found
a
miniature
yolk
surrounded
by
a
transparent
membrane
called
the
zona
pellucida
this
yolk
contains
a
germinal
vesicle
in
which
can
be
discovered
a
nucleus
called
the
germinal
spot
the
process
of
the
growth
of
the
ovaries
is
very
gradual
and
their
function
of
ripening
and
discharging
one
ovum
monthly
into
the
fallopian
tubes
and
uterus
is
not
completed
until
between
the
twelfth
and
fifteenth
years
what
science
after
the
sexual
embrace
we
know
that
the
sperm
is
lifted
within
the
genital
passages
or
portion
of
the
vagina
and
mouth
of
the
uterus
the
time
between
the
deposit
of
the
semen
and
fecundation
varies
according
to
circumstances
if
the
travels
to
the
ovarium
it
generally
takes
from
three
to
five
days
to
make
the
journey
as
pierce
says
the
transportation
is
aided
by
the
ciliary
processes
little
hairs
of
the
mucous
surface
of
the
vaginal
and
uterine
walls
as
well
as
by
its
own
vibratile
movements
the
action
of
the
cilia
under
the
stimulus
of
the
sperm
seems
to
be
from
without
inward
even
if
a
minute
particle
of
sperm
less
than
a
drop
be
left
upon
the
margin
of
the
external
genitals
of
the
female
it
is
sufficient
in
amount
to
impregnate
and
can
be
carried
by
help
of
these
cilia
to
the
ovaries
after
intercourse
at
the
proper
time
the
liability
to
conception
is
very
great
if
the
organs
are
in
a
healthy
condition
conception
must
necessarily
follow
and
no
amount
of
prudence
and
the
most
rigid
precautions
often
fail
to

a

the
question
is
often
asked
can
conception
be
prevented
at
all
times
let
us
say
right
here
that
even
if
such
an
interference
with
nature
laws
were
possible
it
is
inadmissible
and
never
to
be
justified
except
in
cases
of
deformity
or
disease
false
claims
of
during
the
past
few
years
a
great
deal
has
been
written
on
the
subject
claiming
that
new
remedies
had
been
discovered
for
the
prevention
of
conception
but
these
are
all
money
making
devices
to
deceive
the
public
and
enrich
the
pockets
of
miserable
and
unprincipled
imposters
the
truth
of
the
dr
pancoast
an
eminent
authority
says
the
truth
is
there
is
no
medicine
taken
internally
capable
of
preventing
conception
and
the
person
who
asserts
to
the
contrary
not
only
speaks
falsely
but
is
both
a
knave
and
a
fool
foolish
dread
of
what
is
more
deplorable

pitiable
than
an
old

childless
young
people
dislike
the
care
and

of
children
and
prefer
society
and
social
entertainments
and
thereby
do
great
injustice
and
injury
to
their
health
having
children
under
proper
circumstances
never
ruins
the
health
and
happiness
of
any
woman
in
fact
womanhood
is
incomplete
without
them
she
may
have
a
dozen
or
more
and
still
have
better
health
than
before
marriage
it
is
having
them
too
close
together
and
when
she
is
not
in
a
fit
state
that
her
health
gives
way
and
if
the
husband
respects
his
wife
he
will
come
to
her
relief
by
exercising
and
forbearance
but
sometimes
before
the
mother
has
recovered
from
the
effects
of
bearing
nursing
and
rearing
one
child
ere
she
has
regained
proper
tone
and
vigor
of
body
and
mind
she
is
unexpectedly
overtaken
surprised
by
the
manifestation
of
symptoms
which
again
indicate

children
thus

can
not

by

by

let
them
exercise
caution

until
the

becomes
sufficiently
healthy
and
enduring
to
bequeath
her
own
rugged
vital
stamina
to
the
child
she
bears
in
love
a
wrong
to
the
mother
and
sometimes
the
mother
is
diseased
the
outlet
from
the
womb
as
a
result
of
laceration
by
a
previous
is
frequently
enlarged
thus
allowing
conception
to
take
place
very
readily
and
hence
she
has
children
in
rapid
succession
besides
the
wrong
to
the
mother
in
having
children
in
such
rapid
succession
it
is
a
great
injustice
to
the
babe
in
the
womb
and
the
one
at
the
breast
that
they
should
follow
each
other
so
quickly
that
one
is
conceived
while
the
other
is
nursing
one
takes
the
vitality
of
the
other
neither
has
sufficient
nourishment
and
both
are
started
in

stunted
and
incomplete
feeble
and
diseased
if
the
parties
of
a
marriage
are
both
feeble
and
so
adapted
to
each
other
that
their
children
are
deformed
insane
or
idiots
then
to
beget
offspring
would
be
a
flagrant
wrong
if
the
mother
health
is
in
such
a
condition
as
to
forbid
the
right
of
laying
the
burden
of
motherhood
upon
her
then
medical
aid
may
safely
come
to
her
relief
the
desirability
and
practicability
of
limiting
offspring
says
stockham
are
the
subject
of
frequent
inquiry
fewer
and
better
children
are
desired
by
parents
many
men
and
women
wise
in
other
things
of
the
world
permit
generation
as
a
chance
result
of
copulation
without
thought
of
physical
or
mental
conditions
to
be
transmitted
to
the
child
coition
the
one
important
act
of
all
others
carrying
with
it
the
most
vital
results
is
usually
committed
for
selfish
gratification
many
a
drunkard
owes
his
lifelong
appetite
for
alcohol
to
the
fact
that
the
inception
of
his
life
could
be
traced
to
a
night
of
dissipation
on
the
part
of
his
father
physical
degeneracy
and
mental
derangements
are
too
often
caused
by
the
parents
producing
offspring
while
laboring
under
great
mental
strain
or
bodily
fatigue
drunkenness
and
licentiousness
are
frequently
the
heritage
of
posterity
future
generations
demand
that
such
results
be
averted
by
better
prenatal
influences
the
world
is
groaning
under
the
curse
of
chance
parenthood
it
is
due
to
posterity
that
procreation
be
brought
under
the
control
of
reason
and
conscience
it
has
been
feared
that
a
knowledge
of
means
to
control
offspring
would
if
generally
diffused
be
abused
by
women
that
they
would
to
so
great
an
extent
escape
motherhood
as
to
bring
about
social
disaster
this
fear
is
not
well
founded
the
maternal
instinct
is
inherent
and
sovereign
in
woman
even
the
prenatal
influences
of
a
murderous
intent
on
the
part
of
parents
scarcely
ever
eradicate
it
with
this
natural
desire
for
children
we
believe
few
woman
would
abuse
the
knowledge
of
privilege
of
controlling
offspring
although
women
shrink
from
forced
maternity
and
from
the
bearing
of
children
under
the
great
burden
of
suffering
as
well
as
other
adverse
conditions
it
is
rare
to
find
a
woman
who
is
not
greatly
disappointed
if
she
does
not
some
time
in
her
life
wear
the
crown
of
motherhood
an
eminent
lady
teacher
in
talking
to
her
pupils
once
said
greatest
calamity
that
can
befall
a
woman
is
never
to
have
a
child
the
next
greatest
calamity
is
to
have
one
only
from
my
professional
experience
i
am
happy
to
testify
that
more
women
seek
to
overcome
causes
of
sterility
than
to
obtain
knowledge
of
limiting
the
size
of
the
family
or
means
to
destroy
the
embryo
also
if
consultation
for
the
latter
is
sought
it
is
usually
at
the
instigation
of
the
husband
believing
in
the
rights
of
unborn
children
and
in
the
maternal
instinct
i
am
consequently
convinced
that
no
knowledge
should
be
withheld
that
will
secure
proper
conditions
for
the
best
parenthood
the
case
of
the
juke
we
submit
the
following
case
of
the
juke
family
mostly
of
new
york
state
as
related
by
dugdale
when
a
member
of
the
prison
association
and
let
the
reader
judge
for
himself
it
was
traced
out
by
painstaking
research
that
from
one
woman
called
margaret
who
like
topsy
merely
without
pedigree
as
a
pauper
in
a
village
of
the
upper
hudson
about
years
ago
there
descended
children
grandchildren
and
great
grandchildren
of
whom
were
criminals
of
the
dangerous
class
adult
paupers
and
prostitutes
while
children
of
her
lineage
died
prematurely
the
last
fact
proves
to
what
extent
in
this
family
nature
was
kind
to
the
rest
of
humanity
in
saving
it
from
a
still
larger
aggregation
or
undesirable
and
costly
members
for
it
is
estimated
that
the
expense
to
the
state
of
the
descendants
of
maggie
was
over
a
million
dollars
and
the
state
itself
did
something
also
towards
preventing
a
greater
expense
by
the
restrain
exercised
upon
the
criminals
paupers
and
idiots
of
the
family
during
a
considerable
portion
of
their
lives
continence
a
willingness
to
deny
himself
that
is
what
is
required
from
the
husband
but
a
thousand
voices
reach
us
from
suffering
women
in
all
parts
of
the
land
that
this
will
not
suffice
that
men
refuse
thus
to
restrain
themselves
that
it
leads
to
a
loss
of
domestic
happiness
and
to
illegal
amour
or
it
is
injurious
physically
and
morally
that
in
short
such
advice
is
useless
because
impracticable
nature
to
such
we
reply
that
nature
herself
has
provided
to
some
extent
against
overproduction
it
is
well
known
that
women
when
nursing
rarely
become
pregnant
and
for
this
reason
if
for
no
other
women
should
nurse
their
own
children
and
continue
the
period
until
the
child
is
at
least
nine
months
or
a
year
old
however
the
nursing
if
continued
too
long
weakens
both
the
mother
and
the
child
another
provision
of
for
a
certain
period
between
her

every
woman

sterile
conception
may
be
avoided
by
refraining
from
coition
except
for
this
particular
number
of
days

by
prenatal

those
temporary

of

previous

which
stamp
their
impress
upon

three
we
may
consider
this
subject
as
one
which
naturally
divides
itself
into
three
periods
the
preparation
which
precedes

the
mental
moral
and
physical
conditions
at
the
time
of
conjunction
and
the
environment
and
condition
of

during

period
of
gestation
prominent
newton
says
numerous
facts
indicate
that
offspring
may
be
affected
and
their
tendencies
shaped
by
a
great
variety
of
influences
among
which
moods
and
influences
more
or
less
transient
may
be
included
dr
stall
says
prenatal
influences
are
both
subtle
and
potent
and
no
amount
of
wealth
or
learning
or
influence
can
secure
exemption
from
them
john
cowan
says
upon
this
subject
the
fundamental
principles
of
genius
in
reproduction
are
that
through
the
rightly
directed
wills
of
the
father
and
mother
preceding
and
during
antenatal
life
the
child
form
or
body
character
of
mind
and
purity
of
soul
are
formed
and
established
that
in
its
plastic
state
during
antenatal
life
like
clay
in
the
hands
of
the
potter
it
can
be
molded
into
absolutely
any
form
of
body
and

the
parents
may
knowingly
desire

like
it
is
folly
to
expect
strong
and
vigorous
children
from
weak
and
sickly
parents
or
virtuous
offspring
from
impure
ancestry
james
foster
scott
tells
us
that
purity
is
in
fact
the
crown
of
all
real
manliness
and
the
vigorous
and
robust
who
by
repression
of
evil
have
preserved
their
sexual
potency
make
the
best
husbands
and

they
are
the
direct
benefactors
for
the
race
by
begetting
progeny
who
are
not
predisposed
to

vitiation

and
mental
degeneracy
blood
will
thus
we
see
that
prenatal
influences
greatly
modify
if
they
do
not
wholly
control
inherited
tendencies
is
it
common
sense
to
suppose
that
a
child
begotten
when
the
parents
are
exhausted
from
mental
or
physical
overwork
can
be
as
perfect
as
when
the
parents
are

the
buoyancy

to
suppose
that

can
squander
their

still
have
it

actual

a

they
find
that

is
impotent
the

find

something

infallibly
has
a

man
may
arise
either
from

condition
of

deprives
it
of
its
fecundating
powers
or
it
may
spring
from
a
malformation
which
prevents
it
reaching
the
point
where
fecundation
takes
place
the
former
condition
is
most
common
in

is
a
sequence
of
venereal
disease

from

change
in

structure

the
latter
has
its

in
an
injury

in
that
condition
technically
known
as
hypospadias
or
in

it
can
be
safely
said
that
neither

often
leads
to

the
agricultural
theory
as
it
may
be
called
because
adopted
by
farmers
is
that
impregnation
occurring
within
four
days
of
the
close
of
the
female
monthlies
produces
a
girl
because
the
ovum
is
yet
immature
but
that
when
it
occurs
after
the
fourth
day
from
its
close
gives
a
boy
because
this
egg
is
now
mature
whereas
after
about
the
eighth
day
this
egg
dissolves
and
passes
off
so
that
impregnation
is
thereby
rendered
impossible

just

to
him
who
brings
this
curse
upon
his
head
to
haunt
him
all
the
days
of
his
or
her
life
and
to
curse
him
at
the
day
of
his
death
the
product
of
lust
pure
and
simple
the
only
difference
between
a
marriage
of
this
character
and
prostitution
is
that
society
rotten
to
its
heart
pulpits
afraid
to
cry
aloud
against
crime
and
vice
and
the
church
conformed
to
the
world
have
made
such
a
profanation
of
marriage
respectable
to
put
it
in
other
words
when
two
people
determine
to
live
together
as
husband
and
wife
and
evade
the
consequences
and
responsibilities
of
marriage
they
are
simply
engaged
in
prostitution
without
the
infamy
which
attaches
to
that
vice
and
crime
outrageous
violation
of
all
the
violation
of
all
law
both
natural
and
revealed
is
the
cool
and
villainous
contract
by
which
people
entering
into
the
marital
relation
engage
in
defiance
of
the
laws
of
god
and
the
laws
of
the
commonwealth
that
they
shall
be
unencumbered
with
a
family
of
children
disguise
the
matter
as
you
will
says
pomeroy
yet
the
fact
remains
that
the
first
and
specific
object
of
marriage
is
the
rearing
of
a
family
be
fruitful
and
multiply
and
replenish
the
earth
is
god
first
word
to
adam
after
his
creation
the
national
the
prevention
of
offspring
is
preeminently
the
sin
of
america
it
is
fast
becoming
the
national
sin
of
america
and
if
it
is
not
checked
it
will
sooner
or
later
be
an
irremediable
calamity
the
sin
has
its
roots
in
a
low
and
perverted
idea
of
marriage
and
is
fostered
by
false
standards
of
modesty
the
sin
of
do
these
same
sepulchres
of
hell
know
that
they
are
committing
the
damning
sin
of
herod
in
the
slaughter
of
the
innocents
and
are
accessories
before
the
fact
to
the
crime
of
murder
do
women
in
all
circles
of
society
when
practicing
these
terrible
crimes
realize
the
real
danger
do
they
understand
that
it
is
undermining
their
health
and
their
constitution
and
that
their
destiny
if
persisted
in
is
a
premature
grave
just
as
sure
as
the
sun
rises
in
the
heavens
let
all
beware
and
let
the
first
and
only
purpose
be
to
live
a
life
guiltless
before
god
and
man
the
crime
of
from
the
moment
of
conception
a
new
life
commences
a
new
individual
exists
another
child
is
added
to
the
family
the
mother
who
deliberately
sets
about
to
destroy
this
life
either
by
want
of
care
or
by
taking
drugs
or
using
instruments
commits
as
great
a
crime
and
is
just
as
guilty
as
if
she
strangled
her
infant
or
as
if
she
snatched
from
her
own
breast
her
six
months
darling
and
dashed
out
its
brains
against
the
wall
its
blood
is
upon
her
head
and
as
sure
as
there
is
a
god
and
a
judgment
that
blood
will
be
required
of
her
the
crime
she
commits
is
murder
child
murder
the
slaughter
of
a
speechless
helpless
being
whom
it
is
her
duty
beyond
all
things
else
to
cherish
and
preserve
dangerous
we
appeal
to
all
such
with
earnest
and
with
threatening
words
if
they
have
no
feeling
for
the
fruit
of
their
womb
if
maternal
sentiment
is
so
callous
in
their
breasts
let
them
know
that
such
produced
abortions
are
the
constant
cause
of
violent
and
dangerous
womb
diseases
and
frequently
of
early
death
that
they
bring
on
mental
weakness
and
often
insanity
that
they
are
the
most
certain
means
to
destroy
domestic
happiness
which
can
be
adopted
better
far
better
to
bear
a
child
every
year
for
twenty
years
than
to
resort
to
such
a
wicked
and
injurious
step
better
to
die
if
need
be
of
the
pangs
of
than
to
live
with
such
a
weight
of
sin
on
the
conscience

footnote
this
is
the
title
of
a
pamphlet
written
by
henry
wright
we
have
taken
some
extracts
from
it
too
often
the
husband
thinks
only
of
his
personal
gratification
he
insists
upon
what
he
calls
his
rights
forces
on
his
wife
an
and
thereby
often
alienates
her
affections
if
he
does
not
drive
her
to
abortion
dr
stockham
reports
the
following
case
a
woman
once
consulted
me
who
was
the
mother
of
five
children
all
born
within
ten
years
these
were
puny
scrofulous
nervous
and
irritable
she
herself
was
a
fit
subject
for
doctors
and
drugs
every
organ
in
her
body
seemed
diseased
and
every
function
perverted
she
was
dragging
out
a
miserable
existence
like
other
physicians
i
had
prescribed
in
vain
for
her
many
maladies
one
day
she
chanced
to
inquire
how
she
could
safely
prevent
conception
this
led
me
to
ask
how
great
was
the
danger
she
said
my
husband
is
absent
from
home
few
nights
have
been
exempt
since
we
were
married
except
it
may
be
three
or
four
immediately
after
confinement
yet
your
husband
loves
you
yes
he
is
kind
and
provides
for
his
family
perhaps
i
might
love
him
but
for
this
while
now
will
god
forgive
me
detest
i
loathe
and
if
i
knew
how
to
support
myself
and
children
i
would
leave
him
you
talk
with
him
upon
this
subject
think
i
can
there
is
hope
for
many
women
can
not
do
that
tell
him
i
will
give
you
treatment
to
improve
your
health
and
if
he
will
wait
until
you
can
respond
time
for
the
act
have
it
entirely
mutual
from
first
to
the
demand
will
not
come
so
frequent
you
think
so
experience
of
many
proves
the
truth
of
this
statement
hopefully
she
went
home
and
in
six
months
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
my
patient
was
restored
to
health
and
a
single
coition
in
a
month
gave
the
husband
more
satisfaction
than
the
many
had
done
previously
that
the
creative
power
was
under
control
and
that
my
lady
could
proudly
say
love
where
previously
she
said
hate
if
husbands
will
listen
a
few
simple
instructions
will
appeal
to
their
and
none
can
imagine
the
gain
to
themselves
to
their
wives
and
children
and
their
children
children
then
it
may
not
be
said
of
the
babes
that
the
borders
on
their
birth
and
their
cradle
stands
in
the
grave

true

your

on
the

in

maternity

there
are
few
vary
few

who
could
not
reveal
a
sad
dark
picture
in

relations
to

maternity
and
the
relation
in
which
it
originates
are
thrust
upon

by

often
without

conditions
and
often
in
contempt
of
their
earnest
and
urgent
entreaties
no

comes
to
their
heart
at
the

of

which
arises
from

consciousness
that
they

survived
the

selfishly
inflicted
upon

husband
when
maternity
is
imposed
on
your
wife
without
her
consent
and
contrary
to
her
appeal
how
will
her
mind
necessarily
be
affected
towards
her
child
it
was
conceived
in
dread
and
in
bitterness
of
spirit
every
stage
of
its
foetal
development
is
watched
with
feeling
of
settled
repugnance
in
every
step
of
its
progress
the
child
meets
only
with
grief
and
indignation
in
the
mother
she
would
crush
out
its
life
if
she
could
she
loathed
its
conception
she
loathed
it
in
every
stage
of

development
instead
of
fixing
her
mind
on
devising
ways
and
means
for
the
healthful
and
happy
organization
and
development
of
her
child
before
it
is
born
and
for
its
post
natal
comfort
and
support
her
soul
may
be
intent
on
its
destruction
and
her
thoughts
devise
plans
to
kill
it
in
this
how
often
is
she
aided
by
others
there
are
those
and
they
are
called
men
and
women
whose
profession
is
to
devise
ways
to
kill
children
before
they
are
born
those
who
do
this
would
not
hesitate
but
for
the
consequences
to
kill
them
after

are

for
the
state
of

that
would

would

public
sentiment
consigns
the
murderer
of
children
to
the
dungeon
or
the
gallows
while
the
murderers
of
antenatal
children
are
often
allowed
to
pass
in
society
as
honest
and
honorable
men
and
women
the
following
is
an
extract
from
a
letter
written
by
one
who
has
proudly
and
nobly
filled
the
station
of
a
wife
and
mother
and
whose
children
and
grandchildren
surround
her
and
crown
her
life
with
tenderest
love
and
respect
it
has
often
been
a
matter
of
wonder
to
me
that
men
should
so
heedlessly
and
so
injuriously
to
themselves
their
wives
and
children
and
their
homes
demand
at
once
as
soon
as
they
get
legal
possession
of
their
wives
the
gratification
of
a
passion
which
when
indulged
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
gratification
of
the
moment
must
end
in
the
destruction
of
all
that
is
beautiful
noble
and
divine
in
man
or
woman
i
have
often
felt
that
i
would
give
the
world
for
a
friendship
with
man
that
should
show
no
impurity
in
its
bearing
and
for
a
conjugal
relation
that
would
at
all
times
heartily
and
practically
recognize
the
right
of
the
wife
to
decide
for
herself
when
she
should
enter
into
the
relation
that
leads
to
maternity
timely
here
let
me
say
that
on
no
subject
should
a
man
and
woman
as
they
are
being
attracted
into
conjugal
relations
be
more
open
and
truthful
with
each
other
than
on
this
no
woman
who
would
save
herself
and
the
man
she
loves
from
a
desecrated
and
wretched
home
should
enter
into
the
physical
relations
of
marriage
with
a
man
until
she
understands
what
he
expects
of
her
as
to
the
function
of
maternity
and
the
relation
that
leads
to
it
if
a
woman
is
made
aware
that
the
man
who
would
win
her
as
a
wife
regards
her
and
the
marriage
relation
only
as
the
means
of
a
legalized
gratification
of
his
passions
and
she
sees
fit
to
live
with
him
as
a
wife
with
such
a
prospect
before
her
she
must
take
the
consequences
of
a
course
so
degrading
and
so
shameless
if
she
sees
fit
to
make
an
offering
of
her
body
and
soul
on
the
altar
of
her
husband
sensuality
she
must
do
it
but
she
has
a
right
to
know
to
what
base
uses
her
womanhood
is
to
be
put
and
it
is
due
to
her
as
well
as
to
himself
that
he
should
tell
beforehand
precisely
what
he
wants
and
expects
of
her
too
frequently
man
shrinks
from
all
allusion
during
courtship
to
his
expectations
in
regard
to
future
passional
relations
he
fears
to
speak
of
them
lest
he
should
shock
and
repel
the
woman
he
would
win
as
a
wife
being
conscious
it
may
be
of
an
intention
to
use
power
he
may
acquire
over
her
person
for
his
own
gratification
he
shuns
all
interchange
of
views
with
her
lest
she
should
divine
the
hidden
sensualism
of
his
soul
and
his
intention
to
victimize
her
person
to
it
the
moment
he
shall
get
the
license
a
woman
had
better
die
at
once
than
enter
into
or
continue
in
marriage
with
a
man
whose
highest
conception
of
the
relation
is
that
it
is
a
means
of
licensed
animal
indulgence
in
such
a
relation
body
and
soul
are
sacrificed
one
distinctive
characteristic
of
a
true
and
noble
husband
is
a
feeling
of
manly
pride
in
the
physical
elements
of
his
manhood
his
physical
manhood
as
well
as
his
soul
is
dear
to
the
heart
of
his
wife
because
through
this
he
can
give
the
fullest
expression
of
his
manly
power
how
can
you
my
friend
secure
for
your
person
the
loving
care
and
respect
of
your
wife
there
is
but
one
way
so
manifest
yourself
to
her
in
the
hours
of
your
most
endearing
intimacies
that
all
your
manly
power
shall
be
associated
only
with
all
that
is
generous
just
and
noble
in
you
and
with
purity
freedom
and
happiness
in
her
make
her
feel
that
all
which
constitutes
you
a
man
and
qualifies
you
to
be
her
husband
and
the
father
of
her
children
belongs
to
her
and
is
sacredly
consecrated
to
the
perfection
and
happiness
of
her
nature
do
this
and
the
happiness
of
your
home
is
made
complete
your
will
be
lovingly
and
reverently
cared
for
because
the
wife
of
your
bosom
feels
that
it
is
the
sacred
symbol
through
which
a
noble
manly
love
is
ever
speaking
to
her
to
cheer
and
sustain
her
woman
is
ever
proud
and
justly
so
of
the
manly
passion
of
her
husband
when
she
knows
it
is
controlled
by
a
love
for
her
whose
manifestations
have
regard
only
to
her
elevation
and
happiness
the
power
which
when
bent
only
on
selfish
indulgence
becomes
a
source
of
more
shame
degradation
disease
and
wretchedness
to
women
and
to
children
than
all
other
things
put
together
does
but
ennoble
her
add
grace
and
glory
to
her
being
and
concentrate
and
vitalize
the
love
that
encircles
her
as
a
wife
when
it
is
controlled
by
wisdom
and
consecrated
to
her
highest
growth
and
happiness
and
that
of
her
children
it
lends
enchantment
to
her
person
and
gives
a
fascination
to
her
smiles
her
words
and
her
caresses
which
ever
breathe
of
purity
and
of
heaven
and
make
her
all
lovely
as
a
wife
and
mother
to
her
husband
and
the
father
of
her
child
passion
is
to
the
conjugal
love
of
the
wife
like
the
sun
to
the
that
opens
its
petals
and
causes
them
to
give
out
their
sweetest
fragrance
and
to
display
their
most
delicate
tints
or
like
the
frost
which
chills
and
kills
it
ere
it
blossoms
in
its
richness
and
a
diadem
of
maternity
when
it
exists
at
the
call
of
the
wife
and
is
gratefully
received
but
binds
her
heart
more
tenderly
and
devotedly
to
her
husband
as
the
father
of
her
child
he
stands
before
her
invested
with
new
beauty
and
dignity
in
receiving
from
him
the
germ
of
a
new
life
she
receives
that
which
she
feels
is
to
add
new
beauty
and
glory
to
her
as
a
woman
a
new
grace
and
attraction
to
her
as
a
wife
she
loves
and
honors
him
because
he
has
crowned
her
with
the
glory
of
a
mother
maternity
to
her
instead
of
being
repulsive
is
a
diadem
of
beauty
a
crown
of
rejoicing
and
deep
tender
and
are
her
love
and
reverence
for
him
who
has
placed
it
on
her
brow
how
noble
how
august
how
beautiful
is
maternity
when
thus
bestowed
and
received
would
you
then
secure
the
love
and
trust
of
your
wife
and
become
an
object
of
her
tenderness
and
reverence
assure
her
by
all
your
manifestations
and
your
perfect
respect
for
the
functions
of
her
nature
that
your
passion
shall
be
in
subjection
of
her
wishes
it
is
not
enough
that
you
have
secured
in
her
heart
respect
for
your
spiritual
and
intellectual
manhood
to
maintain
your
in
your
relations
with
her
to
perfect
your
growth
and
happiness
as
a
husband
you
must
cause
your
nature
to
be
tenderly
cherished
and
reverenced
by
her
in
all
the
sacred
intimacies
of
home
no
matter
how
much
she
reverences
your
intellectual
or
your
social
power
if
by
reason
of
your
passional
manifestations

conception
or
conception
or
impregnation
takes
place
by
the
union
of
the
male
sperm
and
female
sperm
whether
this
is
accomplished
in
the
ovaries
the
oviducts
or
the
uterus
is
still
a
question
of
discussion
and
investigation
by
physiologists

off

with
many
women
says
stockham
in
her
tokology
the
ovum
passes
off
within
or
hours
after
menstruation

some
by
careful
observation
are
able
to
know
with
certainty
when
this
takes
place
it
is
often
accompanied

pain
a
minute
substance
like
the
white
of
an
egg
with
a
fleck
of

in
it
can
frequently
be
seen
upon
the
clothing
ladies
who
have
noticed
this
phenomenon
testify
to
its
recurring
very
regularly
upon
the
same
day
after
menstruation
some
delicate
women
have
observed
it
as
late
as
the
fourteenth
day
conception
is
more
liable
to
take
place
either
immediately
before
or
immediately
after
the
period
and
on
that
account
it
is
usual
when
calculating
the
date
at
which
to
expect
labor
to
count
from
the
day
of
disappearance
of
the
last
period
the
easiest
way
to
make
a
calculation
is
to
count
back
three
months
from
the
date
of
the
last
period
and
add
seven
days
thus
we
might
say
that
the
date
was
the
of
july
counting
back
brings
us
to
the
of
april
and
adding
the
seven
days
will
bring
us
to
the
day
of
april
the
expected
time
evidence
of
very
many
medical
authorities
distinguished
in
this
line
have
stated
their
belief
that
women
never
pass
more
than
two
or
three
days
at
the
most
beyond
the
forty
weeks
conceded
to
pregnancy
that
is
two
hundred
and
eighty
days
or
ten
lunar
months
or
nine
calendar
months
and
a
week
about
two
hundred
and
eighty
days
will
represent
the
average
duration
of
pregnancy
counting
from
the
last
day
of
the
last
period
now
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
there
are
many
disturbing
elements
which
might
cause
the
young
married
woman
to
miss
a
time
during
the
first
month
of
pregnancy
there
is
no
sign
by
which
the
condition
may
be
positively
known
the
missing
of
a
period
especially
in
a
person
who
has
been
regular
for
some
time
may
lead
one
to
suspect
it
but
there
are
many
attendant
causes
in
married
life
the
little
annoyances
of
household
duties
embarrassments
and
the
enforced
gayety
which
naturally
surrounds
the
bride
and
these
should
all
be
taken
into
consideration
in
the
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
she
is
pregnant
but
then
again
there
are
some
rare
cases
who
have
menstruated
throughout
their
pregnancy
and
also
cases
where
menstruation
was
never
established
and
pregnancy
occurred
nevertheless
the
of
the
period
with
other
signs
may
be
taken
as
presumptive
evidence
artificial

it
may
not
be
generally
known
that
union
is
not
essential
to
impregnation
it
is
possible
for
conception
to
occur
without
congress
all
that
is
necessary
is
that
seminal
animalcules
enter
the
womb
and
unite
there
with
the
egg
or
ovum
it
is
not
essential
that
the
semen
be
introduced
through
the
medium
of
the
male
organ
as
it
has
been
demonstrated
repeatedly
that
by
means
of
a
syringe
and
freshly
obtained
and
healthy

impregnation
can
be
made
to
follow
by
its
careful
introduction

are
physicians
in
france
who
make
a
specialty
of
artificial

as
it
is
called
and
produce

leads
a

suspect

this
provided
she
has
just

health

a
strong
symptom

still
there
must

others
to
corroborate
it

menstruate

this
without

is
an
abnormal
condition

should

disastrous
consequences
may
result

let
me
again
urge
the
importance
of
a
lady
during
the
whole
period
of
pregnancy
being
particular
as
to
the
state
of
her
bowels
as
costiveness
is
a
fruitful
cause
of
painful
tedious
and
hard
labors
the
best
laxatives
are

are

when
the
bowels
are
easily
acted
upon
two

three

four
pills
made
of
castile
soap
will
frequently
answer
the
purpose
and
if
they
will

eaten
at

dissolved
in

frequently
comfortably

inestimable
superiority
warm

an
excellent
remedy
for
costiveness
of
pregnancy
is
an
enema
either
of
warm
water
or
of
castile
soap

water
which
the
patient
by
means
of

may
administer

herself
the
quantity
of
warm
water
to
be
used
is
from
half
a
pint
to
a
pint
the
proper
heat
is
the
temperature
of
new
milk
the
time
for
administering
it
is
early
in
the
morning
twice

three
times
a

muscular

of
the
the
best
remedy
is
an
abdominal
belt
constructed
for
pregnancy
and
adjusted
with
proper
straps
and
buckles
to
accomodate
the
gradually
increasing
size
of
the
womb
this
plan
often
affords
great
comfort
and
relief
indeed
such
a
belt
is
indispensably
necessary
although
the
bowels
in
pregnancy
are
generally
costive
they
are
sometimes
in
an
opposite
state
and
are
relaxed
now
this
relaxation
is
frequently
owing
to
there
having
been
prolonged
constipation
and
nature
is
trying
to
relieve
herself
by
purging
do
not
check
it
but
allow
it
to
have
its
course
and
take
a
little
rhubarb
or
magnesia
the
diet
should
be
simple
plain
and
nourishing
and
should
consist
of
beef
tea
chicken
broth
and
of
and
oatmeal
gruel
butcher
meat
for
a
few
days
should
not
be
eaten
and
stimulants
of
all
kinds
must
be
avoided
a
pregnant
lady
sometimes
suffers
severely
from
fidgets
it
generally
affects
her
feet
and
legs
especially
at
night
so
as
to
entirely
destroy
her
sleep
she
can
not
lie
still
she
every
few
minutes
moves
tosses
and
tumbles
about
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
the
causes
of
fidgets
are
a
heated
state
of
the
blood
an
irritable
condition
of
the
nervous
system
prevailing
at
that
particular
time
and
want
of
occupution
the
treatment
of
fidgets
consists
of
sleeping
in
a
apartment
with
either
window
or
door
open
a
thorough
ablution
of
the
whole
body
every
morning
and
a
good
washing
with
tepid
water
of
the
face
neck
chest
arms
and
hands
every
night
shunning
hot
and
close
rooms
taking
plenty
of
exercise
living
on
a
bland
nourishing
put
not
rich
diet
avoiding
meat
at
night
and
substituting
in
lieu
thereof
either
a
cupful
of
made
with
milk
or
of
oatmeal
gruel
if
a
lady
during
the
night
have
the
fidgets
she
should
get
out
of
bed
take
a
short
walk
up
and
down
the
room
being
well
protected
by
a
empty
her
bladders
turn
her
pillow
so
as
to
have
the
cold
side
next
the
head
and
then
lie
down
again
and
the
chances
are
that
she
will
now
fall
asleep
if
during
the
day
she
have
the
fidgets
a
ride
in
an
open
carriage
or
a
stroll
in
the
garden
or
in
the
fields
or
a
little
housewifery
will
do
her
good
and
there
is
nothing
like
fresh
air
exercise
and
occupation
to
drive
away
the
fidgets
heartburn
is
a
common
and
often
a
distressing
symptom
of
pregnancy
the
acid
producing
the
heartburn
is
frequently
much
increased
by
an
overloaded
stomach
an
abstemious
diet
ought
to
be
strictly
observed
great
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
quality
of
the
food
greens
pastry
hot
buttered
toast
melted
butter
and
everything
that
is
rich
and
gross
ought
to
be
carefully
avoided
either
a
teaspoonful
of
heavy
calcined
magnesia
or
half
a
teaspoonful
of
carbonate
of
soda
the
former
to
be
preferred
if
there
be
constipation
should
occasionally
be
taken
in
a
of
warm
water
if
these
do
not
relieve
the
above
directions
as
to
diet
having
been
strictly
attended
to
the
following
mixture
ought
to
be
tried
take
of
carbonate
of
ammonia
half
a
drachm
bicarbonate
of
soda
a
drachm
and
a
half
water
eight
ounces
to
make
a
mixture
two
tablespoonfuls
to
be
taken
twice
or
three
times
a
day
until
relief
be
obtained
wind
in
the
stomach
and
this
is
a
frequent
reason
why
a
pregnant
lady
can
not
sleep
at
night
the
two
most
frequent
causes
of
flatulence
are
first
the
want
of
walking
exercise
during
the
day
and
second
the
eating
of
a
hearty
meal
just
before
going
to
bed
at
night
the
remedies
are
of
course
in
each
instance
swollen
legs
from
enlarged
veins
varicose
veins
the
veins
are
frequently
much
enlarged
and
distended
causing
the
legs
to
be
greatly
swollen
and
very
painful
preventing
the
patient
from
taking
proper
walking
exercise
swollen
legs
are
owing
to
the
pressure
of
the
womb
upon
the
above
women
who
have
had
large
families
are
more
liable
than
others
to
varicose
veins
if
a
lady
marry
late
in
life
or
if
she
be
very
heavy
in
pregnancy
carrying
the
child
low
down
she
is
more
likely
to
have
distention
of
the
veins
the
best
plan
will
be
for
her
to
wear
during
the
day
an
elastic
stocking
which
ought
to
be
made
on
purpose
for
her
in
order
that
it
may
properly
fit
the
leg
and
foot
stretching
of
the
skin
of
the
abdomen
this
is
frequently
in
a
first
pregnancy
distressing
from
the
soreness
it
causes
the
best
remedy
is
to
rub
the
abdomen
every
night
and
morning
with
warm
camphorated
oil
and
to
wear
a
belt
during
the
day
and
a
broad
flannel
bandage
at
night
both
of
which
should
be
put
on
moderately
but
comfortably
tight
the
belt
must
be
secured
in
its
situation
by
means
of
properly
adjusted
straps
before
the
approach
of
the
patient
before
the
approach
of
labor
ought
to
take
particular
care
to
have
the
bowels
gently
opened
as
during
that
state
a
costive
state
greatly
increases
her
sufferings
and
lengthens
the
period
of
her
labor
a
gentle
action
is
all
that
is
necessary
a
violent
one
would
do
more
harm
than
good
swollen
and
painful
breasts
the
breasts
are
at
times
during
pregnancy
much
swollen
and
very
painful
and
now
and
then
they
cause
the
patient
great
uneasiness
as
she
fancies
that
she
is
going
to
have
either
some
dreadful
tumor
or
a
gathering
of
the
bosom
there
need
in
such
a
case
be
no
apprehension
the
swelling
and
the
pain
are
the
consequences
of
the
pregnancy
and
will
in
due
time
subside
without
any
unpleasant
result
for
treatment
she
can
not
do
better
than
rub
them
well
every
night
and
morning
with
equal
parts
of
eau
de
cologne
and
olive
oil
and
wear
a
piece
of
new
flannel
over
them
taking
care
to
cover
the
nipples
with
soft
linen
as
the
friction
of
the
flannel
might
irritate
them
bowel
complaints
bowel
complaints
during
pregnancy
are
not
unfrequent
a
dose
either
of
rhubarb
and
magnesia
or
of
castor
oil
are
the
best
remedies
and
are
generally
in
the
way
of
medicine
all
that
is
necessary
cramps
cramps
of
the
legs
and
of
the
thighs
during
the
latter
period
and
especially
at
night
are
apt
to
attend
pregnancy
and
are
caused
by
the
womb
pressing
upon
the
nerves
which
extend
to
the
lower
extremities

frequently
troublesome
and
are
in
a
measure
occasioned
by
the
pressure
of
the
womb
on
the
parts
below
causing
irritation
the
best
way
therefore
to
obviate
such
pressure
is
for
the
patient
to
lie
down
a
great
part
of
each
day
either
on
a
bed
or
a
sofa
she
ought
to
retire
early
to
rest
she
should
sleep
on
a
hair
mattress
and
in
a
well
ventilated
apartment
and
should
not
overload
her
bed
with
clothes
a
thick
heavy
quilt
at
these
times
and
indeed
at
all
times
is
particularly
objectionable
the
perspiration
can
not
pass
readily
through
it
as
through
blankets
and
thus
she
is
weakened
she
ought
to
live
on
plain
wholesome
nourishing
food
and
she
must
abstain
from
beer
and
wine
and
spirits
the

ought
to
be
gently

a

woman
is
especially
liable
to
suffer
many
forms

dyspepsia

troubles
sleeplessness
etc
morning
sickness
is
the
most
common
and
is
the
result
of
an
irritation
in
the
womb
caused
by
some
derangement
and
it
is
greatly
irritated
by
the
habit
of
indulging
in
sexual
gratification
during
pregnancy
if
people
would
imitate
the
lower
animals
and
reserve
the
vital
forces
of
the
mother
for
the
benefit
of
her
unborn
child
it
would
be
a
great
boon
to
humanity
morning
sickness
may
begin
the
next
day
after
conception
but
it
usually
appears
from
two
to
three
weeks
after
the
beginning
of
pregnancy
and
continues
with
more
or
less
severity
from

elizabeth
cady
stanton
in
a
lecture
to

thus
strongly
states
her
views
regarding
maternity
and
painless
childbirth
we
must
educate
our
daughters
to
think
that
motherhood
is
grand
and
that
god
never
cursed
it
and
this
curse
if
it
be
a
curse
may
be
rolled
off
as
man
has
rolled
away
the
curse
of
labor
as
the
curse
has
been
rolled
from
the
descendants

ham
my
mission
is
to
preach
this
new
gospel
if
you
suffer
it
is
not
because
you
are
cursed
of
god
but
because
you
violate
his
laws
what
an
incubus
it
would
take
from
woman
could
she
be
educated
to
know
that
the
pains
of
maternity
are
no
curse
upon
her
kind
we
know
that
among
the
indians
the
squaws
do
not
suffer
in
childbirth
they
will
step
aside
from
the
ranks
even
on
the
march
and
return
in
a
short
time
to
them
with
the
child
what
an
absurdity
then
to
suppose
that
only
enlightened
christian
women
are
cursed
but
one
word
of
fact
is
worth
a
volume
of
philosophy
let
me
give
you
some
of
my
own
experience
i
am
the
mother
of
seven
children
my
girlhood
was
spent
mostly
in
the
open
air
i
early
imbibed
the
idea
that
a
girl
was
just
as
good
as
a
boy
and
i
carried
it
out
i
would
walk
five
miles
before
breakfast
or
ride
ten
on
horseback
after
i
was
married
i
wore
my
clothing
sensibly
their
weight
hung
entirely
on
my
shoulders
i
never
compressed
my
body
out
of
its
natural
shape
when
my
first
four
children
were
born
i
suffered
very
little
i
then
made
up
my
mind
that
it
was
totally
unnecessary
for
me
to
suffer
at
all
so
i
dressed
lightly
walked
every
day
lived
as
much
as
possible
in
the
open
air
ate
no
condiments
or
spices
kept
quiet
listened
to
music
looked
at
pictures
and
took
proper
care
of
myself
the
night
before
the
birth
of
the
child
i
walked
three
miles
the
child
was
born
without
a
particle
of
pain
i
bathed
it
and
dressed
it
and
it
weighed
ten
and
pounds
that
same
day
i
dined
with
the
family
everybody
said
i
would
surely
die
but
i
never
had
a
relapse
or
a
inconvenience
from
it
i
know
this
is
not
being
delicate
and
refined
but
if
you
would
be
vigorous
and
healthy
in
spite
of
the
diseases
of
your
ancestors
and
your
own
disregard
of
nature

children
born
of

are
liable
to
a

dwarfed
and
puny
race

their

are
better

those
of
the
children
of
inactive
dependent
indolent
mothers
who
have
neither
brain
nor
muscle
to
transmit
to

or

the
truth
seems
to
be
that
excessive
labor
with
either
body
or
mind
is
alike
injurious
to
both
men
and
women
and
herein
lies
the
sting
of
that
old
curse
this
paragraph
suggests
all
that
need
be
said
on
the
question
whether
pregnant
women
should
or
should
not
labor
foolishly
at
least
it
is
certain
that
they
should
not
be
foolishly
idle
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
equally
certain
that
they
should
be
relieved
from
painful
laborious
occupations
that
exhaust
and
unfit
them
for
happiness
pleasant
and
useful
physical
and
intellectual
occupation
however

not
only
do
no
harm
but

he
who

words
for
young
mothers
the
act
of
nursing
is
sometimes
painful
to
the
mother
especially
before
the
habit
is
fully
established
the
discomfort
is
greatly
increased
if
the
skin
that
covers
the
nipples
is
tender
and
delicate
the
suction
pulls
it
off
leaving
them
in
a
state
in
which
the
necessary
pressure
of
the
child
lips
cause
intense
agony
this
can
be
prevented
in
a
great
measure
says
elizabeth
robinson
scovil
in
home
if
not
entirely
by
bathing
the
nipples
twice
a
day
for
six
weeks
before
the
confinement
with
powdered
alum
dissolved
in
alcohol
or
salt
dissolved
in
brandy
if
there
is
any
symptom
of
the
skin
cracking
when
the
child
begins
to
nurse
they
should
be
painted
with
a
mixture
of
tannin
and
glycerine
this
must
be
washed
off
before
the
baby
touches
them
and
renewed
when
it
leaves
them
if
they
are
very
painful
the
doctor
will
probably
order
morphia
added
to
the
mixture
a
rubber
nipple
shield
to
be
put
on
at
the
time
of
nursing
is
a
great
relief
if
the
nipples
are
retracted
or
drawn
inward
they
can
be
drawn
out
painlessly
by
filling
a
pint
bottle
with
boiling
water
emptying
it
and
quickly
applying
the
mouth
over
the
nipple
as
the
air
in
the
bottle
cools
it
condenses
leaving
a
vacuum
and
the
nipple
is
pushed
out
by
the
air
behind
it
when
the
milk
accumulates
or
cakes
in
the
breast
in
hard
patches
they
should
be
rubbed
very
gently
from
the
base
upwards
with
warm
camphorated
oil
the
rubbing
should
be
the
lightest
most
delicate
stroking
avoiding
pressure
if
lumps
appear
at
the
base
of
the
breast
and
it
is
red
swollen
and
painful
cloths
wrung
out
of
cold
water
should
be
applied
and
the
doctor
sent
for
while
the
breast
is
full
and
hard
all
over
not
much
apprehension
need
be
felt
it
is
when
lumps
appear
that
the
physician
should
be
notified
that
he
may
if
possible
prevent
the
formation
of
abscesses
while
a
woman
is
nursing
she
should
eat
plenty
of
nourishing
food
milk
oatmeal
cracked
wheat
and
good
juicy
fresh
meat
boiled
roasted
or
broiled
but
not
fried
between
each
meal
before
going
to

and
once
during

night
she
should
take
a
cup
of
cocoa
gruel
made
with

good
beef
tea
mutton

any
warm
nutritive
drink
tea
and
coffee
are
to
be

it
is
important
to
keep
the
digestion
in

the
bowels
should
be
carefully
regulated
as
a
means
to
this
end
if
necessary
any
of
the
laxative
mineral
waters
can
be
used
for
this
purpose
or
a
teaspoonful
of
compound
licorice
powder
taken
at
night
powerful
cathartic
medicines
should
be
avoided
because
of
their
effect
upon
the
baby
the
child
should
be
weaned
at
nine
months
old
unless
this
time
comes
in
very
hot
weather
or
the
infant
is
so
delicate
that
a
change
of
food
would
be
injurious
if
the
mother
is
not
strong
her
nurseling
will
sometimes
thrive
better
upon
artificial
food
than
on
its
natural
nourishment
by
gradually
lengthening
the
interval
between
the
nursing
and
feeding
the
child
when
it
is
hungry
the
weaning
can
be
accomplished
without
much
trouble
a
young
mother
should
wear
warm

thick
stockings

jacket
over

parental
the

of
having
handsome

has
been
a
question
that
has
interested
the
people
of
all

of
all
nationalities
there
is
no

a
question
as
to
the
influence
that
parents
may
and
do
exert
upon
their
offspring
and
it
is
shown
in
other
parts
of
this
book
that
beauty
depends
largely
on
the
condition
of
health
at
the
time
of
conception
it
is
therefore
of
no
little
moment
that
parents
should
guard
carefully
their
own
health
as
well
as
that
of
their
children
that
they
may
develop
a
vigorous
constitution
there
can
not
be
beauty
without
good
health
marrying
too
we
know
that
marriage
at
too
early
an
age
or
too
late
in
life
is
apt
to
produce
imperfectly
developed
children
both
mentally
and
physically
the
causes
are
a
couple
marrying
too
young
they
lack
maturity
and
consequently
will
impart
weakness
to
their
offspring
while
on
the
other
hand
persons
marrying
late
in
life
fail
to
find
that
normal
condition
which
is
conducive
to
the
health
and
vigor
of
offspring
crossing
of
temperaments

the

wished

to
be
a
musician
so
during

period
of
that
pregnancy
settled
my
whole
mind
on
music

attended
every
musical

could

had
my

has
a
violin
to
play

me

because

home
troubles
she
became
desperate

resolved
that
her
burdens
should
not

made
any
greater
does
it
not
seem
probable
that
the
murderous
intent
even
though
of
short
duration
was
communicated
to
the

resulted
in

the
signs

symptoms
of
labor
although
the
majority
of
patients
a
day
or
two

comes
on
are
more
bright
and
cheerful
some
few
are

fidgety
and

a
few
days
sometimes
a
few
hours
before
labor
commences
the
child
falls
as
it
is
called
that
is
to
say
there
is
a
subsidence
a
dropping
of
the
womb
lower
down
the
abdomen
this
is
the
reason
why
she
feels
lighter
and
more
comfortable
and
more
inclined
to
take
exercise
and
why
she
can
breathe
more
freely
the
only
inconvenience
of
the
dropping
of
the
womb
is
that
the
womb
presses
more
on
the
bladder
and
sometimes
causes
an
irritability
of
that
organ
inducing
a
frequent
desire
to
make
water
the
wearing
the
obstetric
belt
as
so
particularly
enjoined
in
previous
pages
will
greatly
mitigate
this
inconvenience
the
subsidence
the
dropping
of
the
womb
may
then
be
considered
one
of
the
earliest
of
the
precursory
symptoms
of
and
as
the
herald
of
the
coming
event
she
has
at
this
time
an
increased
moisture
of
the
vagina
the
passage
leading
to
the
womb
and
of
the
external
parts
she
has
at
length
slight
pains
and
then
she
has
a
show
as
it
is
called
which
is
the
coming
away
of
a
mucous
plug
which
during
pregnancy
had
hermetically
sealed
up
the
mouth
of
the
womb
the
show
is
generally
tinged
with
a
little
blood
when
a
show
takes
place
she
may
rest
assured
that
labor
has
actually
commenced
one
of
the
early
symptoms
of
labor
is
a
frequent
desire
to
relieve
the
bladder
she
ought
not
on
any
account
unless
it
be
ordered
by
the
medical
man
to
take
any
stimulant
as
a
remedy
for
the
shivering
in
case
of
shivering
or
chills
a
cup
either
of
hot
lea
or
of
hot
gruel
will
be
the
best
remedy
for
the
shivering
and
an
extra
blanket
or
two
should
be
thrown
over
her
and
be
well
tucked
around
her
in
order
to
thoroughly
exclude
the
air
from
the
body
the
extra
clothing
as
soon
as
she
is
warm
and
perspiring
should
be
gradually
removed
as
she
ought
not
to
be
kept
very
hot
or
it
will
weaken
her
and
will
thus
retard
her
labor
she
must
not
on
any
account
force
down
as
her
female
friends
or
as
a
pottering
old
nurse
may
advise
to
grinding
pains
if
sue
does
it
will
rather
retard
than
forward
her
labor
during
this
stage
she
had
better
walk
about
or
sit
down
and
not
confine
herself
to
bed
indeed
there
is
no
necessity
for
her
unless
she
particularly
desire
it
to
remain
in
her
chamber
after
an
uncertain
length
of
time
the
pains
alter
in
character
from
being
grinding
they
become

how
to
dress
diet
and
exercise
in
pregnancy
those
ailments
to
which
pregnant
women
are
liable
are
mostly
inconveniences
rather
than
diseases
although
they
may
be
aggravated
to
a
degree
of
danger
no
patent
nostrums
or
prescriptions
are
necessary
if
there
is
any
serious
difficulty
the
family
physician
should
be
consulted
wealth
and
luxuries
are
not
a
necessity
comfort
will
make
the
surroundings
pleasant
drudgery
overwork
and
exposure
are
the
three
things
that
tend
to
make
women
miserable
while
in
the
state
of
pregnancy
and
invariably
produce
irritable
fretful
and
feeble
children
stockham
says
in
her
admirable
work
tokology
the
woman
who
indulges
in
the
excessive
gayety
of
fashionable
life
as
well
as
the
overworked
woman
deprives
her
child
of
vitality
she
attends
parties
in
a
dress
that
is
unphysiological
in
warmth
distribution
and
adjustment
in
rooms
badly
ventilated
partakes
of
a
supper
of
indigestible
compounds
and
remains
into
the
hours
her
nervous
system
taxed
to
the
utmost
a
goodly
amount
of
moderate
exercise
is
a
necessity
and
a
large
amount
of
work
may
be
accomplished
if
prudence
is
properly
exercised
it
is
overwork
and
the
want
of
sufficient
rest
and
sleep
that
produces
serious
results
a
pregnant
woman
should
make
her
dresses
of
light
material
and
avoid
surplus
trimmings
do
not
wear
anything
that
produces
any
unnecessary
weight
let
the
clothing
be
light
but
sufficient
in
quantity
to
produce
comfort
in
all
kinds
of
weather
it
is
well
understood
that
the
mother
must
breathe
for
two
and
in
order
to
dress
healthily
the
garments
should
be
worn
loose
so
as
to
give
plenty
of
room
for
respiration
tight
clothes
only
cause
disease
or
produce
frailty
or
malformation
in
the
offspring
wear
a
large
shoe
in
pregnancy
the
feet
may
swell
and
untold
discomfort
may
be
the
result
get
a
good
large
shoe
with
a
large
sole
give
the
feet
plenty
of
room
many
women
suffer
from
defects
in
vision
indigestion
backache
loss
of
voice
headache
simply
as
the
result
of
the
reflex
action
of
the
pressure
of
tight
shoes
many
women
lace
themselves
to
the
first
period
of
their
gestation
in
order
to
meet
their
society
engagements
all
of
this
is
vitally
wrong
and
does
great
injury
to
the
unborn
child
as
well
as
to
inflict
many
ills
and
pains
upon
the
mother
corsets
should
be
carefully
avoided
for
the
corset
more
than
any
other
one
thing
is
responsible
for
making
woman
the
victim
of
more
woes
and
diseases
than
all
other
causes
put
together
about
the
children
born
in
this
country
die
before
they
are
five
years
of
age
and
no
doubt
this
terrible
mortality
is
largely
due
to
this
instrument
of
torture
known
as
the
tight
lacing
is
the
cause
of
infantile
mortality
it
slowly
but
surely
takes
the
lives
of
tens
of
thousands
and
so
effectually
weakens
and
diseases
so
as
to
cause
the
untimely
death
of
millions
more
next
to
godliness
is
cleanliness
a
pregnant
woman
should
take
a
sponge
or
two
or
three
times
a
week
it
stimulates
and
invigorates
the
entire
body
no
more
than
two
or
three
minutes
are
required
it
should
be
done
in
a
warm
room
and
the
body
rubbed
thoroughly
after
each
bathing
the
hot
this
bath
is
one
of
the
most
desirable
and
healthful
baths
for
pregnant
women
it
will
relieve
pain
or
acute
inflammation
and
will
be
a
general
tonic
in
keeping
the
system
in
a
good
condition
this
may
be
taken
in
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
or
just
before
retiring
and
if
taken
just
before
retiring
will
produce
invigorating
sleep
will
quiet
the
nerves
cure
headache
weariness
etc
it
is
a
good
plan
to
take
this
bath
every
night
before
retiring
in
case
of
any
disorders
a
woman
who
keeps
this
tip
during
the
period
of
gestation
will
have
a
very
easy
labor
and
a
strong
vigorous
babe
hot
applying
flannel
cloths
wrung
out
of
simple
or
medicated
hot
water
is
a
great
relief
for
acute
suffering
such
as
neuralgia
rheumatic
pain
biliousness
constipation
torpid
liver
colic
flatulency
etc
the
hot
the
hot
serves
the
same
purpose
as
hot
fomentations
and
is
much
more
convenient
no
one
should
go
through
the
period
of
gestation
without
a
hot
the
cold
this
is
a
very
desirable
and
effectual
domestic
remedy
take
a
towel
wrung
from
cold
water
and
apply
it
to
the
affected
parts
then
cover
well
with
several
thicknesses
of
flannel
this
is
excellent
in
cases
of
sore
throat
hoarseness
bronchitis
inflammation
of
the
lungs
croup
etc
it
is
also
excellent
for
indigestion
constipation
or
distress
of
the
bowels
accompanied
by
heat
the
pregnant
woman
should
eat
nutritious
but
not
stimulating
or
heating
food
and
eat
at
the
regular
time
avoid
drinking
much
while
eating
avoid
salt
pepper
and
sweets
as
much
as
possible
eat
all
kinds
of
grains
vegetables
and
fruits
and
avoid
salted
meat
but
eat
chicken
steak
fish
oysters
etc
the
woman
who
eats
indiscriminately
anything
and
everything
the
same
as
any
other
person
will
have
a
very
painful
labor
and
suffer
many
ills
that
could
easily
be
avoided
by
more
attention
being
paid
to
the
diet
with
a
little
study
and
observation
a
woman
will
soon
learn
what
to
eat
and
what
to
avoid

there
are

in

language
to
express
my
convictions
upon
this
subject
the
corset
more
than
any

one
thing
is
responsible
for
woman
being
the
victim
of
disease
and

instrument

am

than
i
the
devastation

ruin
alcohol

its
many
tempting
forms
has
brought
to
the
human
family
still
i
solemnly
believe
that
in
weakness
and
deterioration
of
health
the
corset
has
more
to
answer
for
than
intoxicating
drinks
when
asked
how
far
advanced
a
woman
should
be
in
pregnancy
before
she
laid
aside
her
corset
stockham
said
with
emphasis
corset
should
not
be
worn
for
two
hundred
years
before
pregnancy
takes
ladies
it
will
take
that
time
at
least
to
overcome
the
of
tight
garments
which
you
think
so
essential
painless
pregnancy
and
some
excellent
popular
volumes
says
haff
have
been
largely
devoted
to
directions
how
to
secure
a
comfortable
period
of
pregnancy
and
painless
delivery
after
much
conning
of
these
worthy
efforts
to
impress
a
little
common
sense
upon
the
sisterhood
we
are
convinced
that
all
may
be
summed
up
under
the
simple
heads
of
an
unconfined
and
lightly
burdened
waist
moderate
but
persistent
outdoor
exercise
of
which
walking
is
the
best
form
a
plain
unstimulating
chiefly
fruit
and
vegetable
diet
little
or
no
intercourse
during
the
time
these
are
hygienic
rules
of
benefit
under
any
ordinary
conditions
yet
they
are
violated
by
almost
every
pregnant
lady
if
they
are
followed
biliousness
indigestion
constipation
swollen
limbs
morning
sickness
and
nausea
all
will
absent
themselves
or
be
much
lessened
in
pregnancy
more
than
at
any
other
time
corsets
are
injurious
the
waist
and
abdomen
must
be
allowed
to
expand
freely
with
the
growth
of
the
child
the
great
process
of
must
have
room
in
addition
we
can
do
no
better
than
quote
the
following
recapitulation
by
stockham
in
her
famous
tokology
to
give
a
woman
the
greatest
immunity
from
suffering
during
pregnancy
prepare
her
for
a
safe
and
comparatively
easy
delivery
and
insure
a
speedy
recovery
all
hygienic
conditions
must
be
observed
the
dress
must
give
freedom
of
movement
no
pressure
upon
any
part
of
the
body
no
more
weight
than
is
essential
for
warmth
and
both
weight
and
warmth
evenly
distributed
these
requirements
necessitate
looseness
lightness
and
warmth
which
can
be
obtained
from
the
union
underclothes
a
princess
skirt
and
dress
with
a
shoe
that
allows
full
development
and
use
of
the
foot
while
decoration
and
elegance
are
desirable
they
should
not
sacrifice
comfort
and
convenience
let
the
diet
be
light
plain
and
nutritious
avoid
fats
and
sweets
relying
mainly
upon
fruits
and
grain
that
contain
little
of
the
mineral
salts
by
this
diet
bilious
and
inflammatory
conditions
are
overcome
the
development
of
bone
in
the
foetus
lessened
and
muscles
necessary
in
labor
nourished
and
strengthened
exercise
should
be
sufficient
and
of
such
a
character
as
will
bring
into
action
gently
every
muscle
of
the
body
but
must
particularly
develop
the
muscles
of
the
trunk
abdomen
and
groin
that
are
specially
called
into
action
in
labor
exercise
taken
faithfully
and
systematically
more
than
any
other
means
assists
assimilative
processes
and
stimulates
the
organs
of
excretion
to
healthy
action
bathing
must
be
frequent
and
regular
unless
in
special
conditions
the
best
results
are
obtained
from
tepid
or
cold
bathing
which
invigorates
the
system
and
overcomes
nervousness
the
is
the
best
therapeutic
and
hygienic
measure
within
the
reach
of
the
pregnant
woman
therefore
to
establish
conditions
which
will
overcome
many
previous
infractions
of

physiologically
much
of
the
time
of
have
of

the
house
let
be
and

a

must
be
faithfully
taken
from
the
sexual
relation
to
those
who
will
commit
themselves
to
this
course
of
life
patiently
and
persistently
carrying
it
out
through
the
period
of
gestation
the
possibilities
of
attaining
a
healthy
natural
painless
parturition
will
be
remarkably
increased
if
the
first
experiment
should
not
result
in
a
painless
labor
it
without
doubt
will
prove
the
beginning
of
sound
health
persisted
in
through
years
of
married
life
the
ultimate
result
will
be
more
and
more
closely
approximated
while
there
will
be
less
danger
of
diseases
after
childbirth
and
better
and
more
vigorous
children
will
be
produced
then
pregnancy
by
every
true
woman
will
be
desired
and
instead
of
being
a
period
of
disease
suffering
and
direful
forebodings
will
become
a
period
of
health
exalted
pleasure
and
holiest
anticipations
motherhood
will
be
deemed
the
choicest
of

women
will
rejoice
in
a
glad
maternity
and
for
any
will
be
compensated
by

the

the

to

to

a

usually
covers

olive

it

piece

worn
flannel

is

clean
rub
all
off

many
physicians
in

states
recommend
a
thorough
oiling
of
the

avoided

application

injury

should
breathe
feebly

every

a
dozen

the
best
way
to
stew
either
prunes

is
the

them

know
the
value
of
cold
water
as

aperient
it
is
one
of

best
we
possess

unlike

aperients
can
never
by

do
any

an
injection
of
warm

is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
relieve
the

the

the
cry
of
the
child
is
a
language
by
which
the
character
of
its
suffering
to
some
extent
may
be
ascertained
the
manner
in
which
the
cry
is
uttered
or
the
pitch
and
tone
is
generally
a
symptom
of
a
certain
kind
of
disease
the
cry
of
the
child
in
suffering
with
pain
of
the
stomach
is
loud
excitable
and
spasmodic
the
legs
are
drawn
up
and
as
the
pain
ceases
they
are
relaxed
and
the
child
sobs
itself
to
sleep

rests

awakened

is
suffering
with
an
affection

causes
a

natural
food

fully
take

to
boil
the

a

it

it

mr

uses
as
a
sovereign
remedy
frequent
bathing
of
the
affected
parts
in
water
as
hot
as
can
be
borne
if
used
immediately
after
exposure
it
may
prevent

appearing
if
later
it
allays
the
itching
and
gradually
dries
up
the
swellings
though
they
are
very
stubborn
after
they
have
once
appeared

an
application
every
few
hours
keeps
down
the
intolerable

rub
the

thoroughly
over
with

you
cut
off
the

many
thoughtless
young

mostly
the

just

can
not
mean
anything

vile
the
public
ball
is
always
a
resort
of
vile
women
who
picture
to
innocent
girls
the
ease
and
luxury
of
a
harlot
life
and
offer
them
all
manner
of
temptations
to
abandon
the
paths
of

the
public
ball
is
the
resort
of
the
libertine
and
the
adulterer
and
whose
object
is
to
work
the
ruin
of
every
innocent
girl
that
may
fall
into
their
clutches
the
why
does
society
wonder
at
the
increase
of
prostitution

the

promiscuous
dancing
is

largely
endorsed
and
encouraged

thousands

who
wander
the

as

outcasts
all
through
the

of
the

the
low

the

the

sin

is
fostered

a

a
startling
startling
as
it
may
seem
to
some
it
is
a
fact
in
our
large
cities
that
there
are
many
girls
raised
by
parents
with
no
other
aim
than
to
make
them
harlots
at
a
tender
age
they
are
sold
by
fathers
and
mothers
into
an
existence
which
is
worse
than
slavery
itself
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
girls
at
the
tender
age
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
mere
children
hardened
courtesans
lost
to
all
sense
of
shame
and
decency
they
are
reared
in
ignorance
surrounded
by
demoralizing
influences
cut
off
from
the
blessings
of
church
and
sabbath
school
see
nothing
but
licentiousness
intemperance
and
crime
these
young
girls
are
lost
forever
they
are
beyond
the
reach
of
the
moralist
or
preacher
and
have
no
comprehension
of
modesty
and
purity
virtue

parents
too
poor
to

themselves
bring
children
into
the

children
for
whom
they
have
no

consequently
the

easily
falls
a
victim
in
early
womanhood
to
the
heartless
libertine
the
boy
with
no
other
schooling
but
that
of
the
streets
soon
masters
all
the
qualifications
for
a

there
could
be

forbidding
people
to
marry
who
have
no
visible

or
if
they
should

if
their

could
be

it
would
cost

much
of
our
modern
society
admits
libertines
and
seducers
to
the
while
it
excludes
their
helpless
and
degraded
victims
consequently
it
is
not
strange
that
there
are
skeletons
in
many
closets
matrimonial
infelicity
and
wayward
girls
thyself
says
saur
is
an
important
maxim
for
us
all
and
especially
is
it
true
for
girls
all
are
born
with
the
desire
to
become
attractive
girls
especially
want
to
grow
up
not
only
attractive
but
beautiful
some
girls
think
that
bright
eyes
pretty
hair
and
fine
clothes
alone
make
them
beautiful
this
is
not
so
real
beauty
depends
upon
good
health
good
manners
and
a
pure
mind
as
the
happiness
of
our
girls
depends
upon
their
health
it
behoves
us
all
to
guide
the
girls
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
forward
the
best
of
results
there
is
no
one
who
stands
so
near
the
girl
as
the
mother
from
early
childhood
she
occupies
the
first
place
in
the
little
confidence
she
laughs
plays
and
corrects
when
necessary
the
faults
of
her
darling
she
should
be
equally
ready
to
guide
in
the
important
laws
of
life
and
health
upon
which
rest
her
future
teach
your
daughters
that
in
all
things
the
principle
has
its
source
in
life
itself
it
originates
from
divine
life
and
when
they
know
that
it
may
be
consecrated
to
wise
and
useful
purposes
they
are
never
apt
to
grow
up
with
base
thoughts
or
form
bad
habits
their
lives
become
a
happiness
to
themselves
and
a
blessing
to
humanity
teach
teach
your
daughters
that
originates
from
a
seed
a
germ
knowing
this
law
you
need
have
no
fears
that
base
or
unworthy
thoughts
of
the
reproductive
function
can
ever
enter
their
minds
the
growth
development
and
ripening
of
human
seed
becomes
a
beautiful
and
sacred
mystery
the
tree
the
rose
and
all
plant
life
are
equally
as
mysterious
and
beautiful
in
their
reproductive
life
does
not
this
alone
prove
to
us
conclusively
that
there
is
a
divinity
in
the
background
governing
controlling
and
influencing
our
lives
nature
has
no
secrets
and
why
should
we
none
at
all
the
only
care
we
should
experience
is
in
teaching
wisely
yes
lead
them
wisely
teach
them
that
the
seed
the
germ
of
a
new
life
is
maturing
within
them
teach
them
that
between
the
ages
of
eleven
and
fourteen
this
maturing
process
has
certain
physical
signs
the
breasts
grow
round
and
full
the
whole
body
even
the
voice
undergoes
a
change
it
is
right
that
they
should
be
taught
the
natural
law
of
life
in
reproduction
and
the
physiological
structure
of
their
being
again
we
repeat
that
these
lessons
should
be
taught
by
the
mother
and
in
a
tender
delicate
and
confidential
way
become
oh
mother
your
daughter
companion
and
she
will
not
go
elsewhere
for
this
knowledge
which
must
come
to
all
in
time
but
possibly
too
late
and
through
sources
that
would
prove
more
harm
than
good
the
organs
of
creative
life
in
women
are
ovaries
fallopian
tubes
uterus
vagina
and
mammary
glands
the
and
have
already
been
described
under
the
female
generative
organs
the
is
a
muscular
organ
situated
in
the
lower
portion
of
the
pelvis
between
the
bladder
and
the
rectum
it
is
less
than
three
inches
in
length
and
two
inches
in
width
and
one
in
thickness
the
is
a
membranous
canal
which
joins
the
internal
outlet
with
the
womb
which
projects
slightly
into
it
the
opening
into
the
vagina
is
nearly
oval
and
in
those
who
have
never
indulged
in
sexual
intercourse
or
in
handling
the
sexual
organs
is
more
or
less
closed
by
a
membrane
termed
the
the
presence
of
this
membrane
was
formerly
considered
as
undoubted
evidence
of
virginity
its
absence
a
lack
of
chastity
the
are
accessory
to
the
generative
organs
they
secrete
milk
which
the
gatherer
provided
for
the
nourishment
of
the
child
after
birth
menstruation
which
appears
about
the
age
of
thirteen
years
is
the
flow
from
the
uterus
that
occurs
every
month
as
the
ripens
in
the
ovaries
god
made
the
sexual
organs
so
that
the
race
should
not
die
out
he
gave
them
to
us
so
that
we
may
reproduce
life
and
thus
fill
the
highest
position
in
the
created
universe
the
purpose
for
which
they
are
made
is
high
and
holy
and
honorable
and
if
they
are
used
only
for
this
purpose
and
they
must
not
be
used
at
all
until
they
are
fully
matured
they
will
be
a
source
of
greatest
blessing
to
us
all
illustration
the
two
paths
what
will
the
girl
become
at
bad
literature
at
flirting
coquettery
at
fast
life
dissipation
at
an
outcast
at
study
obedience
at
virtue
devotion
at
a
loving
mother
at
an
honored
grandmother
a
careful
study
of
this
organ
of
its
location
of
its
arteries
and
nerves
will
convince
the
growing
girl
that
her
body
should
never
submit
to
corsets
and
tight
lacing
in
response
to
the
demands
of
fashion
even
though
nature
has
so
bountifully
provided
for
the
safety
of
this
important
organ
by
constant
pressure
the
vagina
and
womb
may
be
compressed
into
their
natural
length
or
crowded
into
an
unnatural
position
we
can
readily
see
then
the
effect
of
lacing
or
tight
clothing
under
these
circumstances
the
ligaments
lose
their
elasticity
and
as
a
result
we
have
prolapsus
or
falling
of
the
womb
i
am
more
anxious
for
growing
girls
than
for
any
other
earthly
object
these
girls
are
to
be
the
mothers
of
future
generations
upon
them
hangs
the
destiny
of
the
world
in
coming
time
and
if
they
can
be
made
to
understand
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
with
regard
to
their
own
bodies
now
while
they
are
young
the
children
they
will
give
birth
to
and
the
men
and
women
who
shall
call
them
mother
will
be
of
a
higher
type
and
belong
to
a
nobler
class
than
those
of
the
present
day
all
women
can
not
have
good
features
but
they
can
look
well
and
it
is
possible
to
a
great
extent
to
correct
deformity
and
develop
much
of
the
figure
the
first
step
to
good
looks
is
good
health
and
the
first
element
of
health
is
cleanliness
keep
clean
wash
freely
bathe
regularly
all
the
skin
wants
is
leave
to
act
and
it
takes
care
of
itself
girls
sometimes
get
the
idea
that
it
is
nice
to
be
and
but
they
can
not
get
a
more
false
idea
god
meant
women
to
be
strong
and
and
only
by
being
so
can
they
be
happy
and
capable
of
imparting
happiness
to
others
it
is
only
by
being
strong
and
healthy
that
they
can
be
perfect
in
their
sexual
nature
and
it
is
only
by
being
perfect
in
this
part
of
their
being
that
you
can
become
a
noble
grand
and
beautiful
woman
up
to
the
age
of
puberty
if
the
girl
has
grown

hips
and
shoulders
are
about
the
same

width
the
shoulders
being
perhaps
a
trifle
the
broadest
up
to
this
time
the
sexual
organs
have
grown
but
little
now
they
take
a
sudden
start
and
need
more
room

girls

childhood
has
become
blooming
womanhood
now
if
ever
must
be
laid
the
foundation
of
physical
vigor
and
of
a
healthy
body
girls
should
realize
the
significance
of
this
fact
do
not
get
the
idea
that
men
admire
a
weakly
puny
delicate
languid
creature
a
libel
on
true
womanhood
girls
admire
men
with
broad
chests
square
shoulders
erect
form
keen
bright
eyes
hard
muscles
and
undoubted
vigor
men
also
turn
naturally
to
healthy
robust
girls
and
to
win
their
admiration
girls
must
meet
their
ideals
a
good
form
a
sound
mind
and
a
healthy
body
are
within
the
reach
of
nine
out
of
ten
of
our
girls

proper
care
and
training
physical
bankruptcy
may
claim
the
same
proportion
if
care
and
training
are
neglected
a
woman
five
feet
tall
should
measure
two
feet
around
the
waist
and
inches
around
the
hips
a
waist
less
than
this

indicates
compression

by

or
tight
clothing
exercise

and
vigorous
exercise
using
care
not
to

prove
a
panacea

of
the
ills
which
flesh
is
heir

hour
exercise

the
is
of
far
more
value
from
a
physical
standpoint
than
hours
at
the
piano
boating
is
most
excellent
exercise
and
within
the
reach
of
many
care
in
dressing
is
also
important
and
fortunately
fashion
is
coming
to
the
rescue
here
it
is
essential
that
no
garments
be
suspended
from
the
waist
let
the
shoulders
bear
the
weight
of
all
the
clothing
so
that
the
organs
of
the
body
may
be
left
free
and
unimpeded
sleep
should
be
had
regularly
and
abundantly
avoid
late
hours
undue
excitement
evil
associations
partake
of
plain
nutritious
food
and
health
will
be
your
reward
there
is
one
way
of
destroying
health
which
fortunately
is
not
as
common
among
girls
as
boys
and
which
must
be
mentioned
ere
this
chapter
closes
is
practised
among
growing
girls
to
such
an
extent
as
to
arouse
serious
alarm
many
a
girl
has
been
led
to
handle
and
play
with
her
sexual
organs
through
the
advice
of
some
girl
who
has
obtained
temporary
pleasure
in
that
way
or
perchance
chafing
has
been
followed
by
rubbing
until
the
organs
have
become
congested
with
blood
and
in
this
accidental
manner
the
girl
discovered
what
seems
to
her
a
source
of
pleasure
but
which
alas
is
a
source
of
misery
and
even
death
as
in
the
boy
so
in
the
girl
causes
an
undue
amount
of
blood
to
flow
to
those
organs
thus
depriving
other
parts
of
the
body
of
its
nourishment
the
weakest
part
first
showing
the
effect
of
want
of
sustenance
all
that
has
been
said
upon
this
loathsome
subject
in
the
preceding
chapter
for
boys
might
well
be
repeated
here
but
space
forbids
read
that
chapter
again
and
know
that
the
same
signs
that
betray
the
boy
will
make
known
the
girl
addicted
to
the
vice
the
bloodless
lips
the
dull
heavy
eye
surrounded
with
dark
rings
the
nerveless
hand
the
blanched
cheek
the
short
breath
the
old
faded
look
the
weakened
memory
and
silly
irritability
tell
the
story
all
too
plainly
the
same
evil
result
follows
ending
perhaps
in
death
or
worse
in
insanity
aside
from
the
injury
the
girl
does
herself
by
yielding
to
this
habit
there
is
one
other
reason
which
appeals
to
the
conscience
and
that
is
is
an
offence
against
moral
law
it
is
putting
to
a
vile
selfish
use
the
organs
which
were
given
for
a
high
sacred
purpose
let
them
alone
except
to
care
for
them
when
care
is
needed
and
they
may
prove
the
greatest
blessing
you
have
ever
known
they
were
given
you
that
you
might
become
a
mother

highest
office

called

do
not

yourself
and
become
lower
than
the
beasts

the
field
if
this
habit
has
fastened
itself

any
one
of
our
readers
stop
it
now

not
allow
yourself
to
think
about
it
give
up
all
evil
associations
seek
pure
companions

go

the
danger
that
besets
your

at
this
critical
period
are
you
justified
in
keeping
silent
can
you
be
held
guiltless
if
your
daughter
ruins
body
and
mind
because
you
were
too
modest
to
tell
her
the
laws
of
her

is
no

your
boys
in
morality

and

teach
them
to
embrace
good
and

evil
teach
them
the
true
from
the

the
light
from
the
dark
teach
them
that
when
they
take
a
thing
that
is
not
their
own
they
commit
a
sin
teach
them
that
means
disobedience
of
god
laws
of
every
god
made
every
organ
of
our
body
with
the
intention
that
it
should
perform
a
certain
work
if
we
wish
to
see
we
use
our
eyes
if
we
want
to
hear
our
ears
are
called
into
use
in
fact
nature
teaches
us
the
proper
use
of
our
i
say
to
you
mother
and
oh
so
earnestly
teach
your
boy
that
which
you
may
never
be
ashamed
to
do
about
these
organs
that
make
him
a
teach
him
they
are
called
that
they
are
not
impure
but
of
special
importance
and
made
by
god
for
a
definite
purpose
teach
him
that
there
are
impurities
taken
from
the
system
in
fluid
form
called
urine
and
that
it
passes
through
the
sexual
organs
but
that
nature
takes
care
of
that
teach
him
that
these
organs
are
given
as
a
sacred
trust
that
in
maturer
years
he
may
be
the
means
of
giving
life
to
those
who
shall
live
forever
impress
upon
him
that
if
these
organs
are
abused
or
if
they
are
put
to
any
use
besides
that
for
which
god
made
them
and
he
did
not
intend
they
should
be
used
at
all
until
man
is
fully
grown
they
will
bring
disease
and
ruin
upon
those
who
abuse
and
disobey
the
laws
which
god
has
made
to
govern
them
if
he
has
ever
learned
to
handle
his
or
to
touch
them
in
any
way
except
to
keep
them
clean
not
to
do
it
again
if
he
does
he
will
not
grow
up
happy
healthy
and
strong
teach
him
that
when
he
handles
or
excites
the
sexual
organs
all
parts
of
the
body
suffer
because
they
are
connected
by
nerves
that
run
throughout
the
system
this
is
why
it
is
called
the
whole
body
is
abused
when
this
part
of
the
body
is
handled
or
excited
in
any
manner
whatever
teach
them
to
shun
all
children
who
indulge
in
this
loathsome
habit
or
all
children
who
talk
about
these
things
the
sin
is
terrible
and
is
in
fact
worse
than
lying
or
stealing
for
although
these
are
wicked
and
will
ruin
their
souls
yet
this
habit
of
will
ruin
both
soul
and
body
if
the
sexual
organs
are
handled
it
brings
too
much
blood
to
these
parts
and
this
produces
a
diseased
condition
it
also
causes
disease
in
other
organs
of
the
body
because
they
are
left
with
a
less
amount
of
blood
than
they
ought
to
have
the
sexual
organs
too
are
very
closely
connected
with
the
spine
and
the
brain
by
means
of
the
nerves
and
if
they
are
handled
or
if
you
keep
thinking
about
them
these
nerves
get
excited
and
become
exhausted
and
this
makes
the
back
ache
the
brain
heavy
and
the
whole
body
weak
it
lays
the
foundation
for
consumption
paralysis
and
heart
disease
it
weakens
the
memory
makes
a
boy
careless
negligent
and
listless
it
even
makes
many
lose
their
minds
others
when
grown
commit
suicide
how
often
mothers
see
their
little
boys
handling
themselves
and
let
it
pass
because
they
think
the
boy
will
outgrow
the
habit
and
do
not
realize
the
strong
hold
it
has
upon
them
i
say
to
you
who
love
your
boys
do
think
it
does
no
harm
to
your
boy
because
he
does
not
suffer
now
for
the
effects
of
this
vice
come
on
so
slowly
that
the
victim
is
often
very
near
death
before
you
realize
that
he
has
done
himself
harm
the
boy
with
no
knowledge
of
the
consequences
and
with
no
one
to
warn
him
finds
momentary
pleasure
in
its
practice
and
so
contracts
a
habit
which
grows
upon
him
undermining
his
health
poisoning
his
mind
arresting
his
development
and
laying
the
foundation
for
future
misery
do
not
read
this
book
and
forget
it
for
it
contains
earnest
and
living
truths
do
not
let
false
modesty
stand
in
your
way
but
from
this
time
on
keep
this
thought
in
mind
saving
of
your
boy
follow
its
teachings
and
you
will
bless
god
as
long
as
you
live
read
it
to
your
neighbors
who
like
yourself
have
growing
boys
and
urge
them
for
the
sake
of
humanity
to
heed
its
advice
right
here
we
want
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
we
verily
believe
that
oftentimes
these
habits
originate
in
a
burning
and
irritating
sensation
about
the
organs
caused
by
a
want
of
thorough
washing
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
many
eminent
physicians
now
advocate
the
custom
of
circumcision
claiming
that
the
removal
of
a
little
of
the
foreskin
induces
cleanliness
thus
preventing
the
irritation
and
excitement
which
come
from
the
gathering
of
the
whiteish
matter
under
the
foreskin
at
the
beginning
of
the
glands
this
irritation
being
removed
the
boy
is
less
apt
to
tamper
with
his
sexual
organs
the
argument
seems
a
good
one
especially
when
we
call
to
mind
the
high
physical
state
of
those
people
who
have
practiced
the
custom
happy
is
the
mother
who
can
feel
she
has
done
her
duty
in
this
direction
while
her
boy
is
still
a
child
for
those
mothers
though
whose
little
boys
have
now
grown
to
boyhood
with
the
evil
still
upon
them
and
through
ignorance
permitted
it
we
would
say
at
once
it
is
never
too
late
if
he
has
not
lost
all
will
power
he
can
be
saved
let
him
go
in
confidence
to
a
reputable
physician
and
follow
his
advice
simple
diet
plentiful
exercise
in
open
air
and
congenial
employment
will
do
much
do
not
let
the
mind
dwell
upon
evil
thoughts
shun
evil
companions
avoid
vulgar
stories
sensational
novels
and
keep
the
thoughts
pure
let
him
interest
himself
in
social
and
benevolent
affairs
participate
in
work
farmers
clubs
or
any
organizations
which
tend
to
elevate
and
inspire
noble
sentiment
let
us
remember
that
perfect
man
is
the
noblest
work
of
god
god
has
given
us
a
life
which
is
to
last
forever
and
the
little
time
we
spend
on
earth
is
as
nothing
to
the
ages
which
we
are
to
spend
in
the
world
beyond
so
our
earthly
life
is
a
very
important
part
of
our
existence
for
it
is
here
that
the
foundation
is
laid
for
either
happiness
or
misery
in
the
future
it
is
here
that
we
decide
our
destiny
and
our
efforts
to
know
and
obey
god
laws
in
our
bodies
as
well
as
in
our
souls
will
not
only
bring
blessings
to
us
in
this
life
but
happiness
throughout
eternity
a
question
how
can
a
father
chew
and
smoke
tobacco
drink
and
swear
use
vulgar
language
tell
obscene
stories
and
raise
a
family
of
pure
children
let
the
echo
answer
illustration
suffer
little
children
and
forbid
them
not
to
come
unto
me
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
the
inhumanities
of
parents
not
long
ago
a
presbyterian
minister
in
western
new
york
whipped
his
boy
to
death
for
refusing
to
say
his
prayers
the
little
fingers
were
broken
the
tender
flesh
was
bruised
and
actually
mangled
strong
men
wept
when
they
looked
on
the
lifeless
body
think
of
a
strong
man
from
one
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
pounds
in
weight
pouncing
upon
a
little
child
like
a
tiger
upon
a
lamb
and
with
his
strong
arm
inflicting
physical
blows
on
the
delicate
tissues
of
a
child
body
see
its
frail
and
trembling
flesh
quiver
and
its
tender
nervous
organization
shaking
with
terror
and
fear
how
often
is
this
the
case
in
the
punishment
of
children
all
over
this
broad
land
death
is
not
often
the
immediate
consequence
of
this
brutality
as
in
the
above
stated
case
but
the
punishment
is
often
as
unjust
and
the
physical
constitution
of
children
is
often
ruined
and
the
mind
by
fright
seriously
injured
everyone
knows
the
sudden
sense
of
pain
and
sometimes
dizziness
and
nausea
follow
as
the
results
of
an
accidental
hitting
of
the
ankle
knee
or
elbow
against
a
hard
substance
and
involuntary
tears
are
brought
to
the
eyes
but
what
is
such
a
pain
as
this
compared
with
the
pains
of
a
dozen
or
more
quick
blows
on
the
body
of
a
little
helpless
child
from
the
strong
arm
of
a
parent
in
a
passion
add
to
this
overwhelming
terror
of
fright
the
strangulating
effects
of
sighing
and
shrieking
and
you
have
a
complete
picture
of
who
has
not
often
seen
a
child
receive
within
an
hour
or
two
of
the
first
whipping
a
second
one
for
some
small
ebullition
of
nervous
irritability
which
was
simply
inevitable
from
its
spent
and
worn
condition
would
not
all
mankind
cry
out
at
the
inhumanity
of
one
who
as
things
are
should
propose
the
substitution
of
pricking
or
cutting
or
burning
for
whipping
it
would
however
be
easy
to
show
that
small
jabs
or
pricks
or
cuts
are
more
human
than
the
blows
many
children
receive
why
may
not
lying
be
as
legitimately
cured
by
blisters
made
with
hot
coals
as
by
black
and
blue
spots
made
with
a
ruler
or
whip
the
principle
is
the
same
and
if
the
principle
is
right
why
not
multiply
methods
how
many
loving
mothers
will
without
any
thought
of
cruelty
inflict
half
a
dozen
quick
blows
on
the
little
hand
of
her
child
and
when
she
could
no
more
take
a
pin
and
make
the
same
number
of
thrusts
into
the
tender
flesh
than
she
could
bind
the
baby
on
a
rack
yet
the
would
hurt
far
less
and
would
probably
make
a
deeper
impression
on
the
child
mind
illustration
we
do
not
intend
to
be
understood
that
a
child
must
have
everything
that
it
desires
and
every
whim
and
wish
to
receive
special
recognition
by
the
parents
children
can
soon
be
made
to
understand
the
necessity
of
obedience
and
punishment
can
easily
be
brought
about
by
teaching
them
deny
them
the
use
of
a
certain
plaything
deny
them
the
privilege
of
visiting
certain
of
their
little
friends
deny
them
the
privilege
of
the
table
and
these
can
be
applied
according
to
the
age
and
condition
of
the
child
with
firmness
and
without
any
yielding
children
will
soon
learn
obedience
if
they
see
the
parents
are
sincere
lessons
of
home
government
can
be
learned
by
the
children
at
home
as
well
as
they
can
learn
lessons
at
school
the
trouble
is
many
parents
need
more
government
more
training
and
more
discipline
than
the
little
ones
under
their
control
scores
of
times
during
the
day
a
child
is
told
in
a
short
authoritative
way
to
do
or
not
to
do
certain
little
things
which
we
ask
at
the
hands
of
elder
persons
as
favors
when
we
speak
to
an
elder
person
we
say
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
close
the
door
when
the
same
person
making
the
request
of
a
child
will
say
shut
the
door
bring
me
the
chair
stop
that
noise
sit
down
there
whereas
if
the
same
kindness
was
used
towards
the
child
it
would
soon
learn
to
imitate
the
example
on
the
other
hand
let
a
child
ask
for
anything
without
saying
please
receive
anything
without
saying
thank
you
it
suffers
a
rebuke
and
a
look
of
scorn
at
once
often
a
child
insists
on
having
a
book
chair
or
apple
to
the
inconveniencing
of
an
elder
and
what
an
outcry
is
raised
such
rudeness
such
an
child
his
parents
must
have
neglected
him
strangely
not
at
all
the
parents
may
have
been
steadily
telling
him
a
great
many
times
every
day
not
to
do
these
precise
things
which
you
dislike
but
they
themselves
have
been
all
the
time
doing
those
very
things
before
him
and
there
is
no
proverb
that
strikes
a
truer
balance
between
two
things
than
the
old
one
which
weighs
example
over
against
precept
it
is
a
bad
policy
to
be
rude
to
children
a
child
will
win
and
be
won
and
in
a
long
run
the
chances
are
that
the
child
will
have
better
manners
than
its
parents
give
them
a
good
example
and
take
pains
in
teaching
them
lessons
of
obedience
and
propriety
and
there
will
be
little
difficulty
in
raising
a
family
of
beautiful
and
children
never
correct
a
child
in
the
presence
of
others
it
is
a
rudeness
to
the
child
that
will
soon
destroy
its
it
is
the
way
criminals
are
made
and
should
always
and
everywhere
be
condemned
but
there
are
no
words
to
say
what
we
are
or
what
we
deserve
if
we
do
this
to
the
little
children
whom
we
have
dared
for
our
own
pleasure
to
bring
into
the
perils
of
this
life
and
whose
whole
future
may
be
blighted
by
the
mistakes
of
our
careless
hands
there
are
thousands
of
young
men
and
women
groaning
under
the
penalties
and
burdens
of
life
who
owe
their
misfortunes
their
shipwreck
and
ruin
to
the
ignorance
or
indifference
of
parents
parents
of
course
love
their
children
but
with
that
love
there
is
a
responsibility
that
can
not
be
shirked
the
government
and
training
of
children
is
a
study
that
demands
a
parent
time
and
attention
often
much
more
than
the
claims
of
business
parents
study
the
problems
that
come
up
every
day
in
your
home
remember
your
future
happiness
and
the
future
welfare
of
your
children
depend
upon
it
criminals
and
heredity
wm
round
was
for
many
years
in
charge
of
the
house
of
refuge
on
randall
island
new
york
and
his
opportunities
for
observation
in
the
work
among
criminals
surely
make
him
a
competent
judge
and
he
says
in
his
letter
to
the
new
york
observer
among
this
large
number
of
young
offenders
i
can
state
with
entire
confidence
that
not
one
per
cent
were
children
born
of
criminal
parents
and
with
equal
confidence
i
am
able
to
say
that
the
common
cause
of
their
delinquency
was
found
in
bad
parental
training
in
bad
companionship
and
in
lack
of
wholesome
restraint
from
evil
associations
and
influences
it
was
this
knowledge
that
led
to
the
establishing
of
the
house
of
refuge
nearly
of
a
century
ago
bad
training
thus
it
is
seen
from
one
of
the
best
authorities
in
the
united
states
that
criminals
are
made
either
by
the
indifference
or
the
neglect
of
parents
or
both
or
by
too
much
training
without
proper
judgment
and
knowledge
give
your
children
a
good
example
and
never
tell
a
child
to
do
something
and
then
become
indifferent
as
to
whether
they
do
it
or
not
a
child
should
never
be
told
twice
to
do
the
same
thing
teach
the
child
in
childhood
obedience
and
never
vary
from
that
rule
do
it
kindly
but
firmly
if
your
children
do
not
obey
or
respect
you
in
their
childhood
and
youth
how
can
you
expect
to
govern
them
when
older
and
shape
their
character
for
future
usefulness
and
good
citizenship
the
fundamental
rule
never
tell
a
child
twice
to
do
the
same
thing
command
the
respect
of
your
children
and
there
will
be
no
question
as
to
obedience
chastity
and
purity
of
character
illustration
chastity
is
the
purest
and
brightest
jewel
in
human
character
pierce
in
his
widely
known
says
for
the
full
and
perfect
development
of
mankind
both
mental
and
physical
chastity
is
necessary
the
health
demands
abstinence
from
unlawful
intercourse
therefore
children
should
be
instructed
to
avoid
all
impure
works
of
fiction
which
tend
to
inflame
the
mind
and
excite
the
passions
only
in
total
abstinence
from
illicit
pleasures
is
there
safety
morals
and
health
while
integrity
peace
and
happiness
are
the
conscious
rewards
of
virtue
impurity

downward
with
intemperance
obscenity
and
corrupting
diseases
to
degradation
and
death
a
dissolute
licentious
life
is
filled
with
the
dregs
of
human
suffering
iniquity
and
despair
the
penalties
which
follow
a
violation
of
the
law
of
chastity
are
found
to
be
severe
and
swiftly
retributive
the
union
of
the
sexes
in
holy
matrimony
is
a
law
of
nature
finding
sanction
in
both
morals
and
legislation
even
some
of
the
lower
animals
unite
in
this
union
for
life
and
instinctively
observe
the
law
of
conjugal
fidelity
with
a
consistency
which
might
put
to
blush
other
animals
more
highly
endowed
it
seems
important
to
discuss
this
subject
and
understand
our
social
evils
as
well
as
the
intense
passional
desires
of
the
sexes
which
must
be
controlled
or
they
lead
to
ruin
sexual
propensities
are
possessed
by
all
and
these
must
be
held
in
abeyance
until
they
are
needed
for
legitimate
purposes
hence
parents
ought
to
understand
the
value
to
their
children
of
mental
and
physical
labor
to
elevate
and
strengthen
the
intellectual
and
moral
faculties
to
develop
the
muscular
system
and
direct
the
energies
of
the
blood
into
healthful
channels
vigorous
employment
of
mind
and
body
engrosses
the
vital
energies
and
diverts
them
from
undue
excitement
of
the
sexual
desires
your
young
people
plenty
of
outdoor
amusement
less
of
dancing
and
more
of
croquet
and
lawn
tennis
stimulate
the
methods
of
pure
thoughts
in
innocent
amusement
and
your
sons
and
daughters
will
mature
to
manhood
and
womanhood
pure
and
chaste
in
ignorance
does
not
mean
it
is
a
current
idea
especially
among
our
good
common
people
that
the
child
should
be
kept
in
ignorance
regarding
the
mystery
of
his
own
body
and
how
he
was
created
or
came
into
the
world
this
is
a
great
mistake
parents
must
know
that
the
sources
of
social
impurity
are
great
and
the
child
is
a
hundred
times
more
liable
to
have
his
young
mind
poisoned
if
entirely
ignorant
of
the
functions
of
his
nature
than
if
judiciously
enlightened
on
these
important
truths
by
the
parent
the
parent
must
give
him
weapons
of
defense
against
the
putrid
corruption
he
is
sure
to
meet
outside
the
parental
roof
the
child
can
not
get
through
the
a
b
c
period
of
school
without
it
conflicting
there
is
a
great
difference
of
opinion
regarding
the
age
at
which
the
child
should
be
taught
the
mysteries
of
nature
some
maintain
that
he
can
not
comprehend
the
subject
before
the
age
of
puberty
others
say
they
will
find
it
out
soon
enough
it
is
not
best
to
have
them
while
they
are
so
young
wait
a
while
that
is
just
the
point
will
find
it
and
we
ask
in
all
candor
is
it
not
better
that
they
learn
it
from
the
pure
loving
mother
untarnished
from
any
insinuating
remark
than
that
they
should
learn
it
from
some
libertine
on
the
street
or
some
giddy
girl
at
school
mothers
fathers
which
think
you
is
the
most
sensible
and
fraught
with
the
least
danger
to
your
darling
boy
or
girl
delay
is
fraught
with
knowledge
on
a
subject
so
vitally
connected
with
moral
health
must
not
be
deferred
it
is
safe
to
say
that
no
child
no
boy
at
least
in
these
days
of
excitement
and
unrest
reaches
the
age
of
ten
years
without
getting
some
idea
of
laws
regarding
parenthood
and
chances
to
one
those
ideas
will
be
vile
and
pernicious
unless
they
come
from
a
wise
loving
and
pure
parent
now
we
entreat
you
parents
mothers
do
not
wait
begin
before
a
false
notion
has
had
chance
to
find
lodgment
in
the
childish
mind
but
remember
this
is
a
lesson
of
life
it
can
not
be
told
in
one
chapter
it
is
as
important
as
the
lessons
of
love
and
duty
the
first
should
you
be
asked
by
your
four
or
old
mamma
where
did
you
get
me
instead
of
saying
the
doctor
brought
you
or
god
made
you
and
a
stork
brought
you
from
babyland
on
his
back
tell
him
the
truth
as
you
would
about
any
ordinary
question
one
mother
explanation
was
something
like
this
my
dear
you
were
not
made
any
more
than
apples
are
made
or
the
little
chickens
are
made
your
dolly
was
made
but
it
has
no
life
like
you
have
god
has
provided
that
all
living
things
such
as
plants
trees
little
chickens
little
kittens
little
babies
should
grow
from
seeds
or
little
tiny
eggs
apples
grow
little
chickens
grow
little
babies
grow
apple
and
peach
trees
grow
from
seeds
that
are
planted
in
the
ground
and
the
apples
and
peaches
grow
on
the
trees
baby
chickens
grow
inside
the
eggs
that
are
kept
warm
by
the
mother
hen
for
a
certain
time
baby
boys
and
girls
do
not
grow
inside
an
egg
but
they
start
to
grow
inside
of
a
snug
warm
nest
from
an
egg
that
is
so
small
you
can
not
see
it
with
just
your
eye
this
was
not
given
at
once
but
from
time
to
time
as
the
child
asked
questions
and
in
the
simplest
language
with
many
illustrations
from
plant
and
animal
life
it
may
have
occupied
months
but
in
time
the
lesson
was
fully
understood
the
second
the
second
lesson
came
with
the
question
but
is
the
nest
the
ice
is
now
broken
as
it
were
it
was
an
easy
matter
for
the
mother
to
say
the
nest
in
which
you
grew
dear
was
close
to
your
mother
heart
inside
her
body
all
things
that
do
not
grow
inside
the
egg
itself
and
which
are
kept
warm
by
the
mother
body
begin
to
grow
from
the
egg
in
a
nest
inside
the
mother
body
it
may
be
that
this
mother
had
access
to
illustrations
of
the
babe
in
the
womb
which
were
shown
and
explained
to
the
child
a
boy
he
was
pleased
and
satisfied
with
the
explanations
it
meant
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
any
more
than
a
primary
lesson
on
the
circulatory
system
did
it
was
knowledge
on
nature
in
its
purity
and
simplicity
taught
by
mother
and
hence
caused
no
surprise
the
subject
of
the
male
and
female
generative
organs
came
later
the
greatest
pains
and
care
was
taken
to
make
it
clear
the
little
boy
was
taught
that
the
were
made
for
a
high
and
holy
purpose
that
their
office
at
present
is
only
to
carry
off
impurities
from
the
system
in
the
fluid
form
called
urine
and
that
he
must
never
handle
his
nor
touch
them
in
any
way
except
to
keep
them
clean
and
if
he
does
this
he
will
grow
up
a
bright
happy
and
healthy
boy
but
if
he
excites
or
them
he
will
become
puny
sickly
and
unhappy
all
this
was
explained
in
language
pure
and
simple
there
is
now
in
the
boy
a
sturdy
base
of
character
building
along
the
line
of
virtue
and
purity
through
knowledge
silly
dirty
but
i
hear
some
mother
say
such
silly
dirty
trash
to
tell
a
child
it
is
not
dirty
nor
silly
it
is
untarnished
truth
god
has
ordained
that
children
should
thus
be
brought
into
the
world
do
you
call
the
works
of
god
silly
remember
kind
mother
and
do
forget
it
if
you
fail
to
teach
your
children
boys
or
girls
these
important
lessons
early
in
life
they
will
learn
them
from
other
sources
perhaps
long
ere
you
dream
of
it
and
times
out
of
one
hundred
they
will
get
improper
perverted
impure
and
vile
ideas
of
these
important
truths
besides
you
nave
lost
their
confidence
and
you
will
never
regain
it
in
these
matters
they
will
never
come
to
mamma
for
information
on
these
subjects
and
think
you
that
your
son
and
daughter
later
in
life
will
make
you
their
confidant
as
they
ought
will
your
beautiful
daughter
hand
the
first
letters
she
receives
from
her
lover
to
mamma
to
read
and
seek
her
counsel
and
advice
when
she
replies
to
them
will
she
ask
mamma
whether
it
is
ever
proper
to
sit
in
her
lap
i
think
not
you
have
blighted
her
confidence
and
alienated
her
affections
you
have
kept
knowledge
from
her
that
she
had
a
right
to
know
you

failed
to
teach
her
the
important
truths
of
menstruation

and
excited
at
the
first

the
results
she
is
now

from
it
to
this
day

you
would
never

by
your
consummate
foolishness
and
mock
modesty
you
have
ruined
your

in

may
forgive
you

of

when

arise
that
can
not

by
observation
reply
to
each
as
simply

as

answer

treat

is
lord
of
conclusion
of
the
whole
observation

common
sense
should
teach
every
parent
that
lack
of
knowledge
on
these
subjects
and
proper
counsel
and
advice
in
later
years
is
the
main
cause
of
so
many
charming

being
seduced
and
led
astray
and
so
many
bright
promising
boys
wrecked
by

social
make
your
children
your
confidants
early
in
life
especially
in
these
things
have
frequent
talks
with
them
on

and
you
will
never

afraid
of

are
you
that
will
never

really
selects
a
the
loss
of
maiden
purity
and
natural
i
will
not
lift
the
veil
nor
expose
the
conduct
of
children
among
themselves
and
all
this
because
adults
have
filled
their
heads
with
those
impurities
which
surfeit
their
own
what
could
more
effectually
wear
off
that
natural
delicacy
that
maiden
purity
and
bashfulness
which
form
the
main
barriers
against
the
influx
of
vitiated
amativeness
how
often
do
those
whose
modesty
has
been
worn
smooth
even
take
pleasure
in
thus
saying
and
doing
things
to
raise
the
blush
on
the
cheek
of
youth
and
innocence
merely
to
witness
the
effect
of
this
improper
illusion
upon
them
little
realizing
that
they
are
thereby
breaking
down
the
barriers
of
their
virtue
and
prematurely
kindling
the
fires
of
animal
passion
balls
parties
and
the
entire
machinery
of
balls
and
parties
of
dances
and
other
amusements
of
young
people
tend
to
excite
and
inflame
this
passion
thinking
it
a
fine
thing
to
get
in
love
they
court
and
form
attachments
long
before
either
their
mental
or
physical
powers
are
matured
of
course
these
young
loves
these
exotics
must
be
broken
off
and
their
miserable
subjects
left
burning
up
with
the
fierce
fires
of
a
flaming
passion
which
if
left
alone
would
have
slumbered
on
for
years
till
they
were
prepared
for
its
proper
management
and
exercise
sowing
the
seeds
for
future
nor
is
it
merely
the
conversation
of
adults
that
does
all
this
mischief
their
manners
also
increase
it
young
men
take
the
hands
of

from
six
to
thirteen
years
old
kiss
them
press
them
and

with
them
so
as
in

great
variety
of
ways
to
excite
their
innocent
passions
combined
i
grant
with
friendship
and
refinement
for
all
this
is
genteely
done
they
intend
no
harm
and
parents
dream
of
none
and
yet
their
embryo
love
is
awakened
to
be
again
still
more
easily
excited
maiden
ladies
and
even
married
women
often
express
similar
feelings
towards

perhaps
positively
improper

injurious

ultimate
effects

how
often
have
i
seen
girls
not
twelve
years
old
as
hungry
for
a
story
or
novel
as
they
should
be
for
their
dinners
a
sickly
sentimentalism
is
thus
formed
and
their
minds
are
sullied
with
impure
desires
every
fashionable
young
lady
must
of
course
read
every
new
novel
though
nearly
all
of
them
contain
exceptionable
allusions
perhaps
delicately
covered
over
with
a
thin
gauze
of
fashionable
refinement
yet
on
that
very
account
the
more
objectionable
if
this
work
contained
one
improper
allusion
to
their
ten
many
of
those
fastidious
ladies
who
now
eagerly
devour
the
vulgarities
of
dumas
and
the
of
bulwer
and
even
converse
with
gentlemen
about
their
contents
would
discountenance
or
condemn
it
as
improper
on
for
they
can
not
have
pure
minds
or
unsullied
feelings
but
cupid
and
the
beaux
and
waking
of
dreams
of
love
are
fast
consuming
their
health
and
virtue
theaters
and
theatrical
dancing
also
inflame
the
passions
and
are
the
wide
gate
of
the
broad
road
of
moral
impurity
fashionable
music
is
another
especially
the
verses
set
to
it
being
mostly
ditties
or
sentimental
odes
breathing
this
tender
passion
in
its
most
melting

strains
improper
prints
often
do
immense
injury
in
this
respect
as
do

that
passions
begin
at
the
age
of
puberty
but
the
passions
may
be
produced
as
early
as
five
or
ten
years
all
depends
upon
the
training
or
the
want
of
it
is
not
an
uncommon
evil
at
the
age
of
eight
or
ten
a
company
of
bad
boys
often
teach
an
innocent
child
that
which
will
develop
his
ruin
a
boy
may
feel
a
sense
of
pleasure
at
eight
and
produce
a
slight
discharge
but
not
of
semen
thus
it
is
seen
that
parents
may
by
neglect
do
their
child
the
greatest
injury
false
let
there
be
no
false
modesty
on
part
of
the
parents
give
the

the
necessary
advice
and
instructions
as
soon
as
necessary
the

unsexed
by
mutilation
or
masturbation
eunuchs
are
proverbial
for
tenor
cruelty
and
crafty
and
unsympathizing
dispositions
their
mental
powers
are
feeble
and
their
physical
strength
is
inferior
they
lack
courage
and
physical
endurance
when
a
child
is
operated
upon
before
the
age
of
puberty
the
voice
retains
its
childish
treble
the
limbs
their
soft
and
rounded
outlines
and
the
neck
acquires
a
feminine
fulness
no
beard
makes
its
appearance
in
ancient
times
and
up
to
this
time
in
oriental
nations
eunuchs
are
found
they
are
generally
slaves
who
have
suffered
mutilation
at
a
tender
age
it
is
a
scientific
fact
that
where
boys
have
been
taught
the
practice
of
masturbation
in
their
early
years
say
from
eight
to
fourteen
years
of
age
if
they
survive
at
all
they
often
have
their
powers
reduced
to
a
similar
condition
of
a
eunuch
they
generally
however
suffer
a
greater
disadvantage
their
health
will
be
more
or
less
injured
in
the
eunuch
the
power
of
sexual
intercourse
is
not
entirely
lost
but
of
course
there
is
sterility
and
little
if
any
satisfaction
and
the
same
thing
may
be
true
of
the
victim
of
signs
of
as
the
young
man
develops
in
strength
and
years
the
sexual
appetite
will
manifest
itself
the
secretion
of
the
male
known
as
the
seed
or
semen
depends
for
the
power
upon
little
minute
bodies
called
spermatozoa
these
are
very
active
and
numerous
in
a
healthy
secretion
being
many
hundreds
in
a
single
drop
and
a
single
one
of
them
is
capable
to
bring
about
conception
in
a

napheys
in
his
transmission
of

says
the
secreted
fluid
has
been
frozen
and
kept
at
a
temperature
of
zero
for
four
days
yet
when
it
was
thawed
these
animalcules
as
they
are
supposed
to
be
were
as
active
as
ever
they
are
not
however
always
present
and
when
present
may
be
of
variable
activity
in
young
men
just
past
puberty
and
in
aged
men
they
are
often
scarce
and
languid
in
motion
at
the
proper
age
the
secretion
is
supposed
to
be
the
most
active
generally
at
the
age
of
and
decreases
as
age
increases
hygienic
the
man
at
should
guard
carefully
his
passions
and
the
husband
his
virile
powers
and
as
the
years
progress
steadily
wean
himself
more
from
his
desire
for
his
passions
will
become
weaker
with
age
and
any
excitement
in
middle
life
may
soon
debilitate
and
destroy
his
virile
powers
follies
of
dr
napheys
says
not
many
men
can
fritter
away
a
decade
or
two
of
years
in
dissipation
and
excess
and
ever
hope
to
make
up
their
losses
by
rigid
surveillance
in
later
years
the
sins
of
youth
are
expiated
in
age
is
a
proverb
which
daily
examples
illustrate
in
proportion
as
puberty
is
precocious
will
decadence
be
premature
the
excesses
of
middle
life
draw
heavily
on
the
fortune
of
later
years
the
mill
of
the
gods
grinds
slow
but
it
grinds
exceedingly
fine
and
though
nature
may
be
a
tardy
creditor
she
is
found
at
last
to
be
an
inexorable
one
our
secret
sins
every
healthful
man
has
sexual
desires
and
he
might
as
well
refuse
to
satisfy
his
hunger
as
to
deny
their
existence
the
creator
has
given
us
various
appetites
intended
they
should
be
indulged
and
has
provided
the
means
while
it
is
true
that
a
healthy
man
has
strongly
developed
sexual
passions
yet
god
has
crowned
man
with
reason
and
with
a
proper
exercise
of
this
wonderful
faculty
of
the
human
mind
no
lascivious
thoughts
need
to
control
the
passions
a
pure
heart
will
develop
pure
thoughts
and
bring
out
a
good
life
rioting
in
dr
lewis
says
rioting
in
visions
of
nude
women
may
exhaust
one
as
much
as
an
excess
in
actual
intercourse
there
are
multitudes
who
would
never
spend
the
night
with
an
abandoned
female
but
who
rarely
meet
a
young
girl
that
their
imaginations
are
not
busy
with
her
person
this
species
of
indulgence
is
universal
and
it
is
the
source
of
all
other
forms
the
fountain
from
which
the
external
vices
spring
and
the
nursery
of
masturbation
committing
adultery
in
the
a
young
man
who
allows
his
mind
to
dwell
upon
the
vision
of
nude
women
will
soon
become
a
victim
of
ruinous
passion
and
either
fall
under
the
influence
of
lewd
women
or
resort
to
the
man
who
has
no
control
over
his
mind
and
allows
impure
thoughts
to
be
associated
with
the
name
of
every
female
that
may
be
suggested
to
his
mind
is
but
committing
adultery
in
his
heart
just
as
guilty
at
heart
as
though
he
had
committed
the
deed
so
far
as
the
record
is
preserved
unchastity
has
contributed
above
all
other
causes
more
to
the
ruin
and
exhaustion
and
demoralization
of
the
race
than
all
other
wickedness
and
we
shall
not
be
likely
to
vanquish
the
monster
even
in
ourselves
unless
we
make
the
thoughts
our
point
of
attack
so
long
as
they
are
sensual
we
are
indulging
in
sexual
abuse
and
are
almost
sure
when
temptation
is
presented
to
commit
the
overt
acts
of
sin
if
we
can
not
succeed
within
we
may
pray
in
vain
for
help
to
resist
the
tempter
outwardly
a
young
man
who
will
indulge
in
obscene
language
will
be
guilty
of
a
worse
deed
if
opportunity
is
offered
bad
if
women
knew
how
much
mischief
they
do
men
they
would
change
some
of
their
habits
of
dress
the
dress
of
their
busts
the
padding
in
different
parts
are
so
contrived
as
to
call
away
attention
from
the
soul
and
fix
it
on
the
bosom
and
hips
and
then
many
even
educated
women
are
careful
to
avoid
serious
subjects
in
our
presence
one
minute
before
a
gentleman
enters
the
room
they
may
be
engaged
in
thoughtful
discussion
but
the
moment
he
appears
their
whole
style
changes
they
assume
light
fascinating
ways
laugh
sweet
little
bits
of
laughs
and
turn
their
heads
this
way
and
that
all
which
forbids
serious
thinking
and
gives
men
over
to
imagination
the
lustful
how
many
men
there
are
who
lecherously
stare
at
every
woman
in
whose
presence
they
happen
to
be
these
monsters
stare
at
women
as
though
they
were
naked
in
a
cage
on
exhibition
a
man
whose
whole
manner
is
full
of
animal
passion
is
not
worthy
of
the
respect
of
refined
women
they
have
no
thoughts
no
ideas
no
sentiments
nothing
to
interest
them
but
the
bodies
of
women
whom
they
behold
the
moral
character
of
young
women
has
no
significance
or
weight
in
their
eyes
this
kind
of
men
are
a
curse
to
society
and
a
danger
to
the
community
no
young
lady
is
safe
in
their
company
rebuking
if
the
young
women
would
exercise
an
honorable
independence
and
heap
contempt
upon
the
young
men
that
allow
their
imagination
to
take
such
liberties
a
different
state
of
things
would
soon
follow
men
of
that
type
of
character
should
have
no
recognition
in
the
presence
of
ladies
early
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
early
marriages
are
bad
for
both
parties
for
children
of
such
a
marriage
always
lack
vitality
the
ancient
germans
did
not
marry
until
the
or
year
previous
to
which
they
observed
the
most
rigid
chastity
and
in
consequence
they
acquired
a
size
and
strength
that
excited
the
astonishment
of
europe
the
present
incomparable
vigor
of
that
race
both
physically
and
mentally
is
due
in
a
great
measure
to
their
long
established
aversion
to
marrying
young
the
results
of
too
early
marriages
are
in
brief
stunted
growth
and
impaired
strength
on
the
part
of
the
male
delicate
if
not
utterly
bad
health
in
the
female
the
premature
old
age
or
death
of
one
or
both
and
a
puny
sickly
offspring
signs
of
dr
dio
lewis
says
some
of
the
most
common
effects
of
sexual
excess
are
backache
lassitude
giddiness
dimness
of
sight
noises
in
the
ears
numbness
of
the
fingers
and
paralysis
the
drain
is
universal
but
the
more
sensitive
organs
and
tissues
suffer
most
so
the
nervous
system
gives
way
and
continues
the
principal
sufferer
throughout
a
large
part
of
the
premature
loss
of
sight
and
hearing
dizziness
numbness
and
pricking
in
the
hands
and
feet
and
other
kindred
developments
are
justly
chargeable
to
unbridled
venery
not
unfrequently
you
see
men
whose
head
or
back
or
nerve
testifies
of
such
reckless
expenditure
withdrawal
before
the
emission
occurs
is
injurious
to
both
parties
the
soiling
of
the
conjugal
bed
by
the
shameful
manoeuvres
is
to
be
deplored
the
extent
of
the
one
can
not
tell
to
what
extent
this
vice
is
practiced
except
by
observing
its
consequences
even
among
people
who
fear
to
commit
the
slightest
sin
to
such
a
degree
is
the
public
conscience
perverted
upon
this
point
still
many
husbands
know
that
nature
often
renders
nugatory
the
most
subtle
calculations
and
reconquers
the
rights
which
they
have
striven
to
frustrate
no
matter
they
persevere
none
the
less
and
by
the
force
of
habit
they
poison
the
most
blissful
moments
of
life
with
no
surety
of
averting
the
result
that
they
fear
so
who
knows
if
the
too
often
feeble
and
weakened
infants
are
not
the
fruit
of
these
in
themselves
incomplete
procreations
and
disturbed
by
preoccupations
foreign
to
the
natural
act
health
of
furthermore
the
moral
relations
existing
between
the
married
couple
undergo
unfortunate
changes
this
affection
founded
upon
reciprocal
esteem
is
little
by
little
effaced
by
the
repetition
of
an
act
which
pollutes
the
marriage
bed
if
the
good
harmony
of
families
and
the
reciprocal
relations
are
seriously
menaced
by
the
invasion
of
these
detestable
practices
the
health
of
women
as
we
have
already
intimated
is
fearfully
injured
crowning
sin
of
the
then
there
is
the
crime
of
abortion
which
is
so
prevalent
in
these
days
it
is
the
crowning
sin
of
the
age
though
in
a
broader
sense
it
includes
all
those
sins
that
are
committed
to
limit
the
size
of
the
family
it
lies
at
the
root
of
our
spiritual
life
says
rev
sinclair
and
though
secret
in
its
nature
paralyzes
christian
life
and
neutralizes
every
effort
for
righteousness
which
the
church
puts
forth
sexual
every
sexual
excitement
is
exhaustive
in
proportion
to
its
intensity
and
continuance
if
a
man
sits
by
the
side
of
a
woman
fondles
and
kisses
her
three
or
four
hours
and
allows
his
imagination
to
run
riot
with
sexual
visions
he
will
be
five
times
as
much
exhausted
as
he
would
by
the
act
culminating
in
emission
it
is
the
sexual
excitement
more
than
the
emission
which
exhausts
as
shown
in
another
part
of
this
work
thoughts
of
sexual
intimacies
long
continued
lead
to
the
worst
effects
to
a
man
whose
imagination
is
filled
with
erotic
fancies
the
emission
comes
as
a
merciful
interruption
to
the
burning
harassing
and
wearing
excitement
which
so
constantly
goads
him
the
desire
of
the
desire
of
good
for
its
own
sake
this
is
love
the
desire
of
good
for
bodily
pleasure
this
is
lust
man
is
a
moral
being
and
as
such
should
always
act
in
the
animal
sphere
according
to
the
spiritual
law
hence
to
break
the
law
of
the
highest
creative
action
for
the
mere
gratification
of
animal
instinct
is
to
perform
the
act
of

of
dr
dio
lewis
says
occasionally
we
meet
a
diseased
female
with
excessive
animal
passion
but
such
a
case
is
very
rare
the
average
woman
has
so
little
sexual
desire
that
if
licentiousness
depended
upon
her
uninfluenced
by
her
desire
to
please
man
or
secure
his
support
there
would
be
very
little

excess
man

he
has
all
the

and
all
the

many

who
take
no
pleasure
in
their
unclean
intimacies
not
only
endure
a
disgusting
life
for
the

thus
gained
but
affect
intense
passion
in
their
sexual

because
they
have

your
licentiousness

instinct
a
deed
which
ruins
the

itself
degrading

loathsome
no
terms

sufficiently
characterize
the
cruelty

disgusting
selfishness
of
your
conduct
when
you
impose
on
them
a

so
detested
as
to
drive
them
to
the
desperation
of

however
certain
that

we
regret
to
say
that
we

not

with

concerning
the
moral
character
of
the

we
have
people
amongst

who
have
deservedly
a
high
character
for
the
tone
of
their
moral
life
we
refer
to
the
members
of
the
society
of
friends
the
average
of
life
amongst
these
reaches
no
less
than
years
and
whilst
some
allowance
must
be
made
for
the
fact
that
amongst
the
friends
the
poor
have
not
a
large
representation
these
figures
show
conclusively
the
soundness
of
this
position
sowing
their
wild
it
is
monstrous
to
suppose
that
healthy
children
should
die
just
as
they
are
coming
to
manhood
the
fact
that
thousands
of
young
people
do
reach
the
age
of
sixteen
or
eighteen
and
then
decline
and
die
should
arouse
parents
to
ask
the
question
why
certainly
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
tell
the
reason
in
thousands
of
instances
and
yet
the
habit
and
practice
of
the
deadly
sin
of
is
actually
ignored
it
is
even
spoken
of
as
a
boyish
folly
not
to
be
mentioned
and
young
men
literally
burning
up
with
lust
are
mildly
spoken
of
as
sowing
their
wild
oats
thus
the
cemetery
is
being
filled
with
masses
of
the
youth
of
america
who
as
in
egypt
of
old
fill
up
the
graves
of
uncleanness
and
lust
some
time
since
a
prominent
christian
man
was
taking
exception
to
my
addressing
men
on
this
subject
observe
this
one
of
his
own
sons
was
at
that
very
time
near
the
lunatic
asylum
through
these
disgusting
sins
what
folly
and
madness
this
is
death
to
true
the
question
for
each
one
is
in
what
way
are
you
going
to
divert
the
courses
of
the
streams
of
energy
which
pertain
to
youthful
vigor
and
manhood
to
be
destitute
of
that
which
may
be
described
as
raw
material
in
the
human
frame
means
that
no
really
vigorous
manhood
can
have
place
to
burn
up
the
juices
of
the
system
in
the
fires
of
lust
is
madness
and
wanton
folly
but
it
can
be
done
to
divert
the
currents
of
life
and
energy
from
blood
and
brain
from
memory
and
muscle
in
order
to
secrete
it
for
the
shambles
of
prostitution
is
death
to
true
manhood
but
remember
it
can
be
done
the
generous
liquid
life
may
inspire
the
brain
and
blood
with
noble
impulse
and
vital
force
or
it
may
be
sinned
away
and
drained
out
of
the
system
until
the
jaded
brain
the
faded
cheek
the
enervated
young
manhood
the
gray
hair
narrow
chest
weak
voice
and
the
enfeebled
mind
show
another
victim
in
the
long
catalogue
of
the
degraded
through
lust
the
sisterhood
of
shame
and
whenever
we
pass
the
sisterhood
of
death
and
hear
the
undertone
of
song
which
is
one
of
the
methods
of
advertising
let
us
recall
the
words
that
these
represent
the
pestilence
which
walketh
in
darkness
the
destruction
that
wasteth
at
noonday
the
allusion
of
course
is
to
the
fact
that
the
great
majority
of
these
harlots
are
full
of
loathsome
physical
and
moral
disease
with
the
face
and
form
of
an
angel
these
women
bite
like
a
serpent
and
sting
like
an
adder
their
traffic
is
not

inevitably

themselves
they
in
their
turn

have
you
never
been
struck
with
the
argument
of
the
apostle
who
warning
others
from
the
corrupt
example
of
the
fleshy
esau
said
lest
there
be
any
fornicator
or
profane
person
as

who
for

sold
his
own
birthright
for
ye

that
even
afterward
when
he
desired
to
inherit
the
blessing
he
was
rejected
he
found
no
place
for
repentance
though
he
sought
it
diligently
with
tears
terrible
and
striking
words

these

assumed

then
like

called

for

you

may
be

affirm

not

be

a

let
us
not
make
any

concerning

to

these

the

may
know
them
as

to

from

given

to
say

the
quality
of
demoralizing

such
as
have
been
produced
from
the
impure

and
unclean

the
subtle
clever

fascinating
undermining
of
the
angel
of
purity
by
modern
sophists
whose
purient
and
vicious
volumes
were
written
to
throw
a
halo
of
charm
and
beauty
about
the
brilliant
courtesan
and
the
splendid
adulteress
the
mixing
up
of

the

are
some
of

hidden
amid
the
glamor

it
be
remembered
that
this

that
the

perhaps
one
of
the
most
inhuman

destroy

which
is
transmitted
from

to

which
in

countless

that

in

accustom
themselves
to
the

with

they
having

no
conception
whatever

an
unsuspecting
wife
nurses
her

with
tenderest

in
sicknesses

are
nothing
more
than
the
consequences

delusion

revenge

despair
drives
her
into

hostile
position
towards

an
inhuman
criminal

the

high

but
when
the
feeling

has
once
been
driven
to
indignation
with
respect

the
position

it
is
to
be

compel
men
to

pure

moral
we
can
not
but
denounce
in
the
strongest
terms
the
profligacy
of
many
married
men
not
content
with
the
moderation
permitted
in
the
divine
appointed
relationship
of
marriage
they
become
adulterers
in

to
gratify
their
accursed
lust
the

down
by
the
sensual
beast
which
reigns
supreme
these
are
the
moral
outlaws
that
make
light
of
this
scandalous
social
iniquity
and
by
their
damnable
example
encourage
young
men
to
sin
a
sad
it
is
constantly
affirmed
by
prostitutes
that
amongst
married
men
are
found
their
chief
supporters
evidence
from
such
a
quarter
must
be
received
with
considerable
caution
nevertheless
we
believe
that
there
is
much
truth
in
this
statement
here
again
we
lay
the
ax
to
the
root
of
the
tree
the
married
man
who
dares
affirm
that
there
is
a
particle
of
physical
necessity
for
this
sin
is
a
liar
and
the
truth
is
not
in
him
whether
these
men
be
princes
peers
legislators
professional
men
mechanics
or
workmen
they
are
moral
pests
a
scandal
to
the
social
state
and
a
curse
to
the
nation
many
married
men
exhaust
themselves
by
these
excesses
they
become
irritable
liable
to
cold
to
rheumatic
affections
and
nervous
depression
they
find
themselves
weary
when
they
rise
in
the
morning
unfitted
for
close
application
to
business
they
become
dilatory
and
careless
often
lapsing
into
entire
lack
of
energy
and
not
seldom
into
the
love
of
intoxicating
stimulants
numbers
of
husbands
and

entering
upon
these
experiences
lose
the
charm
of

natural
to
her
earlier
years

she
is
spoken
of
as
highly
nervous
poorly
and
weak
when
the
whole
truth
is
that
she
is
suffering
from
physical
exhaustion
which
she
can
not
bear
her
features
become
angular
her
hair
prematurely
gray
she
rapidly
settles
down
into
the
nervous
invalid
constantly
needing
medical
aid
and
if
possible
change

these
conditions
are
brought
about
in
many
cases
through
ignorance
on
the
part
of
those
who
are
married
multitudes
of
men
have
neither
read
heard
nor
known
the
truth
of
this
question
we
sympathize
with
our
in
this
that
we
have
been
left
in
practical
ignorance
concerning
the
exceeding
value
and
legitimate
uses
of
these
functions
of
our
being
some
know
that
had
they
known
these
things
in
the
early
days
of
their
married
life
it
would
have
proved
to
them
knowledge
of
exceeding
value
if
this
counsel
is
followed
thousands
of
homes
will
scarcely
know
the
need
of
the
presence
animal
commonsense
teaches
that
children
who
are
begotten
in
the
heat
of
animal
passion
are
likely
to
be
licentious
when
they
grow
up
many
parents
through
excesses
of
eating
and
drinking
become
inflamed
with
wine
and
strong
drink
they
are
sensualists
and
consequently
morally
diseased
now
if
in
such
conditions
men
beget
their
children
who
can
affect
surprise
if
they
develop
licentious
tendencies
are
not
such
parents
largely
to
blame
are
they
not
criminals
in
a
high
degree
have
they
not
fouled
their

nest
and
transmitted
to
their

of

fast
young

been
thus
corrupted
even
as
the
children

the
intemperate
are

to

certainly
no
one
can
deny
that
many
of
our
young
men
are
little
better
than
dogs
so
lawless
are
they
and
ready
for
the
arena
of
licentiousness

of

is
never

by

it

may
become

restraining
this
desire
in

we
often
hear
it

the

of
women
without
injury
to

the

it

if
a

nurses
her

and
the
child
is
not
weaned
until
it
is
nine
or
ten
months
old
the
mother
except
in
rare
cases
will
not
become
enceinte
again
though
cohabitation
with
the
husband
takes
place
selfish
and
unnatural
it
is
natural
and
rational
that
a
mother
should
feed
her
own
children
in
the
selfish
and
unnatural
conduct
of

every

prostitution
is

all

all

a

can
not
long
live
an

life
without
sooner

contracting

brings
to
every
sufferer
not
only
moral
degradation

often
serious
and
vital
injuries

many
times
death
itself
becomes
the
only
relief
should
it
be
regulated
by
law
dr
ziegler
of
philadelphia
in
several
medical
articles
says
that
the
act
of
sexual
connection
should
be
made
in
itself
the
solemnization
of
marriage
and
that
when
any
such
single
act
can
be
proven
against
an
unmarried
man
by
an
unmarried
woman
the
latter
be
at
once
invested
with
all
the
legal
privileges
of
a
wife
by
bestowing
this
power
on
women
very
few
men
would
risk
the
dangers
of
the
society
of
a
dissolute
and
scheming
woman
who
might
exercise
the
right
to
force
him
to
a
marriage
and
ruin
his
reputation
and
life
the
strongest
objection
of
this
would
be
that
it
would
increase
the
temptation
to
destroy
the
purity
of
married
women
for
they
could
be
approached
without
danger
of
being
forced
into
another
marriage
but
this
objection
could
easily
be
harmonized
with
a
good
system
of
well
regulated
laws
many
means
have
been
tried
to
mitigate
the
social
evils
but
with
little
encouragement
in
the
city
of
paris
a
system
of
registration
has
been
inaugurated
and
houses
of
prostitution
are
under
the
supervision
of
the
police
yet
prostitution
has
not
been
in
any
degree
diminished
similar
methods
have
been
tried
in
other
european
towns

without
satisfactory
results

to
every

of

utterly
destroys

ca
look
you
in

if
you
manage
to
catch
his
eye
for
an
instant
you
will
observe
that
its
pupil
is
contracted
to
an
almost
invisible
point
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
he
would
barter
his
very
soul
for
that
which
indulgence
has
made
him
too
poor
to
purchase
and
where
artifice
fails
he
will
grovel
in
abject
agony
of
supplication
for
a
few
grains
at
the
same
time
he
resorts
to
all
kinds
of
miserable
and
transparent
shifts
to
conceal
his
degradation

never

sin
of
ignorance
it
is
customary
to
designate
as
among
the
vices
i
think
misfortune
is
the
more
appropriate
term
it
is
true
that
in
the
physiological
sense
it
is
one
of
the
very
worst
transgressions
of
the
law
but
in
the
moral
sense
it
is
generally
the
sin
of
ignorance
in
the
commencement
and
in
the
end
the
passive
submission
to
a
morbid
and
almost
resistless
impulse
quacks
the
time
has
come
when
the
rising
generation
must
be
thoroughly
instructed
in
this
matter
that
quack
specific
ignorance
has
been
experimented
with
quite
too
long
already
the
true
method
of
insuring
all
persons

it

ten
thousand
surrounding
temptations
find
out
a
way
in
which
it

i

hardly
a
young
person
in
the
world
would
ever
become
addicted
to
if
he
or
she
understood
clearly
the
consequences
if
he
or
she
knew
at
the
outset
that
the
practice
was
directly
destroying
the
bodily
stamina
vitiating
the
moral
tone
and
enfeebling
the
intellect
no
one
would
pursue
the
disgusting
habit
if
he
or
she
was
fully
aware
that
it
was
blasting
all
prospects
of
health
and
happiness
in
the
approaching
period
of
manhood
and
womanhood
general
symptoms
of
the
secret
habit
the
effects
of
either
or
excessive
sexual
indulgence
appear
in
many
forms
it
would
seem
as
if
god
had
written
an
instinctive
law
of
remonstrance
in
the
innate
moral
sense
against
this
filthy
vice
all
who
give
themselves
up
to
the
excesses
of
this
debasing
indulgence
carry
about
with
them
continually
a
consciousness
of
their
defilement
and
cherish
a
secret
suspicion
that
others
look
upon
them
as
debased
beings
they
feel
none
of
that
manly
confidence
and
gallant
spirit
and
chaste
delight
in
the
presence
of
virtuous
females
which
stimulate
young
men
to
pursue
the
course
of
ennobling
refinement
and
mature
them
for
the
social
relations
and
enjoyments
of
life
this
shamefacedness
or
unhappy
quailing
of
the
countenance
on
meeting
the
look
of
others
often
follows
them
through
life
in
some
instances
even
after
they
have
entirely
abandoned
the
habit
and
became
married
men
and
respectable
members
of
society
in
some
cases
the
only
complaint
the
patient
will
make
on
consulting
you
is
that
he
is
suffering
under
a
kind
of
continued
fever
he
will
probably
present
a
hot
dry
skin
with
something
of
a
hectic
appearance
though
all
the
ordinary
means
of
arresting
such
symptoms
have
been
tried
he
is
none
the
better
the
sleep
seems
to
be
irregular
and
unrefreshing
restlessness
during
the
early
part
of
the
night
and
in
the
advanced
stages
of
the
disease
profuse
sweats
before
morning
there
is
also
frequent
starting
in
the
sleep
from
disturbing
dreams
the
characteristic
feature
is
that
your
patient
almost
always
dreams
of
sexual
intercourse
this
is
one
of
the
earliest
as
well
as
most
constant
symptoms
when
it
occurs
most
frequently
it
is
apt
to
be
accompanied
with
pain
a
gleety
discharge
from
the
urethra
may
also
be
frequently
discovered
especially
if
the
patient
examine
when
at
stool
or
after
urinating
other
common
symptoms
are
nervous
headache
giddiness
ringing
in
the
ears
and
a
dull
pain
in
the
back
part
of
the
head
it
is
frequently
the
case
that
the
patient
suffers
a
stiffness
in
the
neck
darting
pains
in
the
forehead
and
also
weak
eyes
are
among
the
common
symptoms
one
very
frequent
and
perhaps
early
symptom
especially
in
young
females
is
solitariness
a
disposition
to
seclude
themselves
from
society
although
they
may
be
tolerably
cheerful
when
in
company
they
prefer
rather
to
be
alone
the
countenance
has
often
a
gloomy
and
expression
the
patient
friends
frequently
notice
a
great
change
large
livid
spots
under
the
eyes
is
a
common
feature
sudden
flashes
of
heat
may
be
noticed
passing
over
the
patient
face
he
is
liable
also
to
palpitations
the
pulse
is
very
variable
generally
too
slow
extreme
emaciation
without
any
other
assignable
cause
for
it
may
be
set
down
as
another
very
common
symptom
if
the
evil
has
gone
on
for
several
years
there
will
be
a
general
unhealthy
appearance
of
a
character
so
marked
as
to
enable
an
experienced
observer
at
once
to
detect
the
cause
in
the
case
of
onanists
especially
there
is
a
peculiar
rank
odor
emitted
from
the
body
by
which
they
may
be
readily
distinguished
one
striking
peculiarity
of
all
these
patients
is
that
they
can
not
look
a
man
in
the
face
cowardice
is
constitutional
with
them
home
treatment
of
the

first
condition

the
ruinous
habit

faithful
adherence
to
this
prohibitory
law
on
the
part
of
the
patient
all
medication
on
the
part
of
the
physician
will
assuredly
fail
the
patient
must
plainly
understand
that
future
prospects
character
health
and
life
itself
depend
on
an
unfaltering
resistance
to
the
morbid
solicitation
with
the
assurance
however
that
a
due
perseverance
will
eventually
render
what
now
seems
like

resistless
and

perfectly
loathsome

man
has
practiced
for
some
time
he
finds
upon
quitting
the
habit
that
he
has
nightly
emissions
he
becomes
alarmed
reads
every
sensational
advertisement
in
the
papers
and
at
once
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
take
something
are
not
stop
the
the
one
thing
needful
above
all
others
is
to
stop
the
cause
i
have
found
that
young
men
are
invariably
mistaken
as
to
what
is
the
cause
when
asked
as
to
the
first
cause
of
their
trouble
they
invariably
say
it
was
but
it
is
not
is
the
this
precedes
the
handling
and
like
every
other
cause
must
be
removed
in
order
to
have
right
results
stop
the
but
remember
the
you
must
not
look
after
every
woman
with
lustful
thoughts
nor
go
courting
girls
who
will
allow
you
to
hug
caress
and
kiss
them
thus
rousing
your
passions
almost
to
a
climax
do
not
keep
the
company
of
those
whose
only
conversation
is
of
a
lewd
and
depraved
character
but
keep
the
company
of
those
ladies
who
awaken
your
higher
sentiments
and
nobler
impulses
who
appeal
to
the
intellect
and
rouse
your
aspiration
in
whose
presence
you
would
no
more
feel
your
passions
aroused
than
in
the
presence
of
your
own
mother
you
will
get
remember
you
will
get
well
do
fear
fear
destroys
strength
and
therefore
increases
the
trouble
many
get
downhearted
discouraged
despairing
the
very
worst
thing
that
can
happen
doing
as
much
harm
and
in
many
cases
more
than
their
former
dissipation
brooding
kills
hope
enlivens
then
sing
with
joy
that
the
savior
of
knowledge
has
vanquished
the
ignorance
of
the
past
that
the
glorious
strength
of
manhood
has
awakened
and
cast
from
you
forever
the
grinning
skeleton
of
vice
be
your
better
self
proud
that
your
thoughts
in
the
are
as
pure
as
you
could
wish
your
dreams
to
be
at
night
do
not
use
tobacco
or
liquor
they
inflame
the
passions
and
irritate
the
nervous
system
they
only
gratify
base
appetites
and
never
rouse
the
higher
feelings
highly
spiced
food
should
be
eschewed

meat
should
be
eaten

and
never
at

try

every

the

often
drop
into
the
rectum
during
sleep
producing
heat
which
extends
to
the
sexual
organs
causing
the
lascivious
dreams
and
emission
this
will
be
noticed
especially
in
the
morning
when
the
feces
usually
distend
the

and

nearly
always
awakes

the
worst
time
of

are
ruined
by
allowing
their
thoughts
to
run
riot
in
the
morning
owing
to
the
passions
being
roused
as
stated
above
the
young
man
lies
half
awake
and
half
dozing
rousing
his
passions
and
reveling
in
lascivious
thought
for
hours
perhaps
thus
completely
sapping
the
fountains
of
purity
establishing
habits
of
vice
that
will
bind
him
with
iron
bands
and
doing
his
physical
system
more
injury
than
if
he
had
practiced
and
had
the
emission
in
a
few
minutes
jump
out
of
bed
at
once
on
waking
and
never
allow
the
thought
to
master

lessen
prostitution
by
toning
down
that
passion
which
alone
patronizes
it
and

wives
by
the
millions
of
those
excessive
conjugal
demands
which
ruin
their

health
besides
souring

the
worst
is
that
though

it
permeates
the
very

of

cases
many
cases
might
be
cited
we
give
but
one
a
man
who
had
contracted
the
disease
reformed
his
ways
and
was
apparently
cured
he
married
and
although
living
a

was

witness
in
his

her
gums

her

the
result
of

where
the

an

of
prevention

of

may
be
aptly
applied
our
desire
would
be
to
herald
to
all
young

in
stentorian
tones
the
advice
avoid
as
a
deadly
enemy
any
approaches

pitfalls
of

be
your
motto
and
then
you

realizing
the
sad
fact
that
many
are
afflicted
with
this
disease
we
would
put
forth
our
utmost
powers
to
help
even
these

hence
give
on
the
following
pages
some
of
the
best
methods
of
cure
how
to
cure
gonorrhoea
clap
causes
impure
connections
etc
as
the
disease
first
commences
to
manifest
itself
the
patient
notices
a
slight
itching
at
the
point
of
the
male
organ
which
is
shortly
followed
by
a
tingling
or
smarting
sensation
especially
on
making
water
this
is
on
account
of
the
inflammation
which
now
gradually
extends
backward
until
the
whole
canal
is
involved
the
orifice
of
the
urethra
is
now
noticed
to
be
swollen
and
reddened
and
on
inspection
a
slight
discharge
will
be
found
to
be
present
and
if
the
penis
is
pressed
between
the
finger
and
thumb
matter
or
pus
exudes
as
the
inflammatory
stage
commences
the
formation
of
pus
is
increased
which
changes
from
a
thin
to
a
thick
yellow
color
accompanied
by
a
severe
scalding
on
making
water
the
inflammation
increases
up
to
the
fifth
day
often
causing
such
pain
on
urinating
that
the
patient
is
tortured
severely
when
the
disease
reaches
its
height
the
erections
become
somewhat
painful
when
the
discharge
may
be
streaked
with
blood
home
treatment
first
see
that
the
bowels
are
loose
if
not
a
cathartic
should
be
given
if
the
digestive
powers
are
impaired
they
should
be
corrected
and
the
general
health
looked
after
if
the
system
is
in
a
good
condition
give
internally
five
drops
of
gelseminum
every
two
hours
the
first
thing
to
be
thought
of
is
to
pluck
the
disease
in

to
four

the
above

and
diminish
the
number
of
injections

be
given

to

that
there

a

may
have
either
a

that

these

in

what

also
true

hence
the
laying

we

as
when

how

a
wife
she
will
not
be
the
most
affectionate
nor
will
she
trouble
her
husband
with
many
of
her
trials
or
difficulties
twilight
sleep
some
years
ago
two
german
physicians
kroenig
and
grauss
of
the
university
of
baden
startled
the
world
by
announcing
dammerschlaf
or
twilight
sleep
a
treatment
which
rendered
childbirth
almost
painless
and
free
from
dangerous
complications
a
woman
clinic
was
established
at
freiburg
where
a
combination
of
scopolamine
and
morphine
was
given
the
muscular
activity
of
the
pelvic
organs
was
not
lessened
the
length
of
labor
was
shortened
and
instruments
were
rarely
necessary
abbott
is
another
sedative
composed
of
hyoseine
morphine
and
cactoid
it
is
less
dangerous
than
the
other
remedy
and
accomplishes
the
same
result
hence
is
greatly
preferred
the
utmost
caution
is
necessary
in
the
administration
of
either
of
these
drugs
and
the
most
competent
medical
supervision
is
essential
to
their
success
the
patient
should
not
be
left
a
moment
without
medical
supervision
the
lying
in
chamber
should
be
darkened
and
kept
as
quiet
as
possible
painless
childbirth
why
should
a
woman
suffer
childbirth
is
a
natural
function
as
natural
as
eating
sleeping
or
walking
if
the
laws
of
nature
are
complied
with
it
loses
most
if
not
all
of
its
terrors
the
facts
show
that
indian
women
and
those
of
other
uncivilized
races
have
children
without
experiencing
pain
and
with
none
of
the
so
common
modern
complications
what
is
the
reason
they
live
a
natural
out
of
doors
life
free
from
the
evils
and
restrictions
of
present
day
civilization
in
dress
and
habits
of
life
a
normal
the
expectant
mother
should
therefore
live
a
perfectly
rational
life
keeping
the
stomach
and
intestines
especially
healthy
and
active
and
hence
the
general
physical
condition
good
an
abundance
of
fresh
air
hearty
exercise
and
childbirth
will
pass
over
without
any
abnormal
consequences
the
diseases
of
women
the
woman
place
is
in
the
for
centuries
the
world
has
stuck
to
this
rule
because
the
woman
has
been
considered
less
fit
for
the
struggles
of
the
active
workaday
world
she
has
been
kept
at
home
shut
in
from
the
air
and
sunshine
deprived
of
healthy
exercise
and
obliged
to
live
a
life
of
confinement
and
inactivity
what
is
the
result
in
connection
with
menstruation
pregnancy
and
child
bearing
a
long
list
of
diseases
peculiar
to
woman
have
arisen
most
of
which
through
proper
food
and
exercise
could
be
avoided
in
matters
so
vital
to
posterity
false
modesty
and
ignorance
can
no
longer
be
tolerated
chlorosis
or
anaemia
plenty
of
good
food
and
fresh
air
will
do
much
to
restore
the
blood
keep
the
bowels
free
satisfactory
results
have
been
brought
about
by
a
systematic
use
of
iron
as
a
tonic
disorders
of
the
menses
retention
of
menstruation
when
due
to
the
condition
of
the
blood
recommend
good
food
fresh
air
and
sunshine
to
improve
circulation
if
the
result
of
cold
and
exposure
means
and
appliances
for
restoring
the
circulation
must
be
adopted
in
either
case
the
bowels
should
be
kept
open
by
injections
vicarious
menstruation
no
attempt
should
be
made
to
stop
the
hemorrhage
during
the
monthly
period
the
discharge
is
usually
light
although
it
occasionally
causes
great
weakness
this
disorder
is
caused
by
the
suppression
of
the
menses
and
must
be
treated
accordingly
between
periods
cessation
of
the
menses
commonly
called
change
of
life
at
this
dangerous
and
trying
period
in
a
woman
life
she
must
adopt
the
utmost
regularity
in
the
habits
of
her
existence

taken
just
before
