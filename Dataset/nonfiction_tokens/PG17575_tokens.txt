hygienic

by
elliott
coues
preface
in
these
few
pages
i
have
tried
to
prepare
something
about
camping
and
walking
such
as
i
should
have
enjoyed
reading
when
i
was
a
boy
and
with
this
thought
in
my
mind
i
some
years
ago
began
to
collect
the
for
a
book
of
this
kind
by
jotting
down
all
questions
about
camping
that
my
young
friends
asked
me
i
have
also
taken
pains
when
i
have
been
off
on
a
walk
or
have
been
camping
to
notice
the
parties
of
campers
and
trampers
that
i
have
chanced
to
meet
and
have
made
a
note
of
their
failures
or
success
the
experiences
of
the
pleasant
days
when
in
my
teens
i
climbed
the
mountains
of
oxford
county
or
sailed
through
casco
bay
have
added
largely
to
the
stock
of
notes
and
finally
the
diaries
of
the
war
and
the
recollections
of
the
field
have
contributed
generously
so
that
with
quotations
and
some
help
from
other
sources
a
sizable
volume
is
ready
although
it
is
prepared
for
young
men
for
students
more
especially
it
contains
much
i
trust
that
will
prove
valuable
to
in
general
i
am
under
obligations
to
elliott
coues
of
the
united
states
army
for
the
valuable
advice
contained
in
chapter
xiii
and
i
esteem
it
a
piece
of
good
fortune
that
his
excellent
work
field
ornithology
should
have
been
published
before
this
effort
of
mine
for
i
hardly
know
where
else
i
could
have
found
the
information
with
authority
so
unquestionable
edward
morse
has
increased
the
debt
of
gratitude
i
already
owe
him
by
taking
his
precious
time
to
draw
my
illustrations
and
prepare
them
for
the
engraver
edward
fickett
of
portland
a
sailmaker
and
formerly
of
the
navy
has
assisted
in
the
chapter
upon
tents
and
there
are
numbers
of
my
young
friends
who
will
recognize
the
results
of
their
experience
as
they
read
these
pages
and
will
please
to
receive
my
thanks
for
making
them
known

how
to
camp
out
chapter
i
getting
ready
the
hope
of
camping
out
that
comes
over
one
in
early
spring
the
laying
of
plans
and
arranging
of
details
is
i
sometimes
think
even
more
enjoyable
than
reality
itself
as
there
is
pleasure
in
this
let
me
advise
you
to
give
a
practical
turn
to
your
anticipations
think
over
and
decide
whether
you
will
walk
go
horseback
sail
camp
out
in
one
place
or
what
you
will
do
then
learn
what
you
can
of
the
route
you
propose
to
go
over
or
the
ground
where
you
intend
to
camp
for
the
season
if
you
think
of
moving
through
or
camping
in
places
unknown
to
you
it
is
important
to
learn
whether
you
can
buy
provisions
and
get
lodgings
along
your
route
see
some
one
if
you
can
who
has
been
where
you
think
of
going
and
put
down
in
a
all
he
tells
you
that
is
important
have
your
clothes
made
or
mended
as
soon
as
you
decide
what
you
will
need
the
earlier
you
begin
the
less
you
will
be
hurried
at
the
last
you
will
find
it
is
a
good
plan
as
fast
as
you
think
of
a
thing
that
you
want
to
take
to
note
it
on
your
memorandum
and
in
order
to
avoid
delay
or
haste
to
cast
your
eyes
over
the
list
occasionally
to
see
that
the
work
of
preparation
is
going
on
properly
it
is
a
good
plan
to
collect
all
of
your
baggage
into
one
place
as
fast
as
it
is
ready
for
if
it
is
scattered
you
are
apt
to
lose
sight
of
some
of
it
and
start
without
it
as
fast
as
you
get
your
things
ready
mark
your
name
on
them
mark
every
thing
you
can
easily
cut
a
out
of
an
old
postal
card
and
mark
with
a
common
brush
such
articles
as
tents
poles
boxes
firkins
barrels
coverings
and
bags
some
railroads
will
not
check
barrels
bags
or
bundles
nor
take
them
on
passenger
trains
inquire
beforehand
and
send
your
baggage
ahead
if
the
road
will
not
take
it
on
your
train
estimate
the
expenses
of
your
trip
and
take
more
money
than
your
estimate
carry
also
an
abundance
of
small
change
do
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
spend
money
on
new
inventions
every
year
there
is
put
upon
the
market
some
patent
knapsack
folding
stove
or
camp
trunk
and
cot
combined
and
there
are
always
for
sale
patent
knives
forks
and
spoons
all
in
one
folding
portfolios
and
marvels
of
tools
let
them
all
alone
carry
your
and
if
you
can
take
more
let
it
be
a
sheath
or
butcher
knife
and
a
common
take
iron
or
cheap
metal
spoons
do
not
attempt
to
carry
crockery
or
glassware
upon
a
march
a
common
tin
cup
is
as
good
as
any
thing
you
can
take
to
drink
from
and
you
will
find
it
best
to
carry
it
so
that
it
can
be
used
easily
take
nothing
nice
into
camp
expecting
to
keep
it
so
it
is
almost
impossible
to
keep
things
out
of
the
dirt
dew
rain
dust
or
sweat
and
from
being
broken
or
bruised
many
young
men
before
starting
on
their
summer
vacation
think
that
the
barber
must
give
their
hair
a
but
it
is
not
best
to
shave
the
head
so
closely
as
it
is
then
too
much
exposed
to
the
sun
flies
and
mosquitoes
a
moderately
short
cut
to
the
hair
however
is
advisable
for
comfort
and
cleanliness
if
you
are
going
to
travel
where
you
have
never
been
before
begin
early
to
study
your
map
it
is
of
great
importance
you
will
find
to
learn
all
you
can
of
the
neighborhood
where
you
are
going
and
to
fix
it
in
your
mind
so
many
things
must
be
done
at
the
last
moment
that
it
is
best
to
do
what
you
can
beforehand
but
try
to
do
nothing
that
may
have
to
be
undone
wear
what
you
please
if
it
be
comfortable
and
durable
do
not
mind
what
people
say
when
you
are
camping
you
have
a
right
to
be
independent
if
you
are
going
on
a
one
of
the
best
things
you
can
do
is
to
train
a
week
or
more
before
starting
by
taking
long
walks
in
the
open
air
finally
leave
your
business
in
such
shape
that
it
will
not
call
you
back
and
do
not
carry
off
keys
which
others
must
have
nor
neglect
to
see
the
dentist
about
the
tooth
that
usually
aches
when
you
most
want
it
to
keep
quiet
for
convenience
the
following
list
is
inserted
here
it
is
condensed
from
a
number
of
notes
made
for
trips
of
all
sorts
except
boating
and
it
is
by
no
means
exhaustive
yet
there
are
very
many
more
things
named
than
you
can
possibly
use
to
advantage
upon
any
one
tour
be
careful
not
to
be

chapter
ii
small
parties
travelling
afoot
and
camping
we
will
consider
separately
the
many
ways
in
which
a
party
can
spend
a
summer
vacation
and
first
we
will
start
into
wild
and
uninhabited
regions
afoot
carrying
on
our
backs
blankets
a
tent
food
and
even
a
and
this
is
hard
work
for
a
young
man
to
follow
daily
for
any
length
of
time
and
although
it
sounds
romantic
yet
let
no
party
of
young
people
think
they
can
find
pleasure
in
it
many
days
for
if
they
meet
with
a
reverse
have
much
rainy
weather
or
lose
their
way
some
one
will
almost
surely
be
taken
sick
and
all
sport
will
end
if
you
have
a
mountain
to
climb
or
a
short
trip
of
only
a
day
or
two
i
would
not
discourage
you
from
going
in
this
way
but
for
any
extended
tour
it
is
too
severe
a
strain
upon
the
physical
powers
of
one
not
accustomed
to
similar
hard
work
camping
out
a
second
and
more
rational
way
especially
for
small
parties
is
that
of
travelling
afoot
in
the
roads
of
a
settled
country
carrying
a
blanket
tent
food
and
cooking
your
meals
and
doing
all
the
work
yourselves
if
you
do
not
care
to
travel
fast
to
go
far
or
to
spend
much
money
this
is
a
fine
way
but
let
me
caution
you
first
of
all
about
overloading
for
this
is
the
most
natural
thing
to
do
it
is
the
tendency
of
human
nature
to
accumulate
and
you
will
continually
pick
up
things
on
your
route
that
you
will
wish
to
take
along
and
it
will
require
your
best
judgment
to
start
with
the
least
amount
of
luggage
and
to
keep
from
adding
to
it
you
have
probably
read
that
a
soldier
carries
a
musket
cartridges
blanket
overcoat
rations
and
other
things
weighing
forty
or
fifty
pounds
you
will
therefore
say
to
yourself
i
can
carry
twenty
take
twenty
pounds
then
and
carry
it
around
for
an
hour
and
see
how
you
like
it
very
few
young
men
who
read
this
book
will
find
it
possible
to
themselves
and
carry
more
than
twenty
pounds
a
greater
distance
than
ten
miles
a
day
for
a
week
to
carry
even
the
twenty
pounds
ten
miles
a
day
is
hard
work
to
many
although
every
summer
there
are
parties
who
do
their
fifteen
twenty
and
more
miles
daily
with
big
knapsacks
on
their
backs
but
it
is
neither
wise
pleasant
nor
healthful
to
the
average
young
man
to
do
this
let
us
cut
down
our
burden
to
the
minimum
and
see
how
much
it
will
be
first
of
all
you
must
take
a
rubber
blanket
or
a
light
rubber
coat
something
that
will
surely
shed
water
and
keep
out
the
dampness
of
the
earth
when
slept
on
you
must
have
something
of
this
sort
whether
afoot
horseback
with
a
wagon
or
in
permanent
camp
for
carrying
your
baggage
you
will
perhaps
prefer
a
knapsack
though
many
old
soldiers
are
not
partial
to
that
article
there
are
also
for
sale
broad
straps
and
other
devices
as
substitutes
for
the
knapsack
whatever
you
take
be
sure
it
has
broad
straps
to
go
over
your
shoulders
otherwise
you
will
be
constantly
annoyed
from
their
cutting
and
chafing
you
you
can
dispense
with
the
knapsack
altogether
in
the
same
way
that
soldiers
do
by
rolling
up
in
your
blanket
whatever
you
have
to
carry
you
will
need
to
take
some
pains
in
this
and
perhaps
call
a
comrade
to
assist
you
lay
out
the
blanket
flat
and
roll
it
as
tightly
as
possible
without
folding
it
enclosing
the
other
baggage
as
you
roll
then
tie
it
in
a
number
of
places
to
prevent
unrolling
and
the
shifting
about
of
things
inside
and
finally
tie
or
strap
together
the
two
ends
and
throw
the
ring
thus
made
over
the
shoulder
and
wear
it
as
you
do
the
strap
of
the
haversack
diagonally
across
the
body
illustration
the
advantages
of
the
roll
over
the
knapsack
are
important
you
save
the
two
and
a
half
pounds
weight
the
roll
is
very
much
easier
to
the
shoulder
and
is
easier
shifted
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
or
taken
off
and
you
can
ease
the
burden
a
little
with
your
hands
it
feels
bulky
at
first
but
you
soon
become
used
to
it
on
the
whole
you
will
probably
prefer
the
roll
to
the
knapsack
but
if
you
carry
much
weight
you
will
very
soon
condemn
whatever
way
you
carry
it
and
wish
for
a
change
a
haversack
is
almost
indispensable
in
all
pedestrian
tours
even
if
you
have
your
baggage
in
a
wagon
it
is
best
to
wear
one
or
some
sort
of
a
small
bag
furnished
with
shoulder
straps
so
that
you
can
carry
a
lunch
writing
materials
and
such
other
small
articles
as
you
constantly
need
you
can
buy
a
haversack
at
the
stores
where
outfits
are
sold
or
you
can
make
one
of
or
rubber
drilling
say
eleven
inches
deep
by
nine
wide
with
a
strap
of
the
same
material
neatly
doubled
and
sewed
together
forty
to
inches
long
and
one
and
inches
wide
cut
the
back
piece
about
nineteen
inches
long
so
as
to
allow
for
a
flap
eight
inches
long
to
fold
over
the
top
and
down
the
front
sew
the
strap
on
the
upper
corners
of
the
back
piece
having
first
sewed
a
facing
inside
to
prevent
its
tearing
out
the
back
woollen
blanket
next
in
the
order
of
necessities
is
a
woollen
blanket
a
good
stout
one
rather
than
the
light
or
flimsy
one
that
you
may
think
of
taking
in
almost
all
of
the
northern
states
the
summer
nights
are
apt
to
be
chilly
while
in
the
mountainous
regions
and
at
the
seaside
they
are
often
fairly
cold
a
lining
of
cotton
drilling
will
perhaps
make
a
thin
blanket
serviceable
this
lining
does
not
need
to
be
quite
as
long
nor
as
wide
as
the
blanket
since
the
ends
and
edges
of
the
blanket
are
used
to
tuck
under
the
sleeper
one
side
of
the
lining
should
be
sewed
to
the
blanket
and
the
other
side
and
the
ends
buttoned
or
you
may
leave
off
the
end
buttons
you
can
thus
dry
it
when
wet
better
than
if
it
were
sewed
all
around
you
can
lay
what
spare
clothing
you
have
and
your
between
the
lining
and
blanket
when
the
night
is
very
cold
in
almost
any
event
you
will
want
to
carry
a
spare
shirt
and
in
cold
weather
you
can
put
this
on
when
you
will
find
that
a
pound
of
shirt
is
as
warm
as
two
pounds
of
overcoat
if
you
take
all
i
advise
you
will
not
absolutely
need
an
overcoat
and
can
thus
save
carrying
a
number
of
pounds
the
tent
question
we
will
discuss
elsewhere
but
you
can
hardly
do
with
less
than
a
piece
of
if
you
have
a
larger
kind
the
man
who
carries
it
must
have
some
one
to
assist
him
in
carrying
his
own
stuff
so
that
the
burden
may
be
equalized
if
you
take
they
will
vex
you
sorely
and
tempt
you
to
throw
them
away
if
you
do
not
carry
them
you
will
wonder
when
night
comes
why
you
did
not
take
them
if
your
tent
is
not
large
so
that
you
can
use
light
ash
poles
i
would
at
least
start
with
them
unless
the
tent
is
a
shelter
as
poles
for
this
can
be
easily
cut
you
will
have
to
carry
a
hatchet
and
the
kind
known
as
the
hatchet
is
better
than
the
for
driving
i
may
as
well
caution
you
here
not
to
try
to
drive
with
the
flat
side
of
the
axe
or
hatchet
for
it
generally
ends
in
breaking
the
handle
quite
an
accident
when
away
from
home
for
on
a
trip
like
that
we
are
now
proposing
you
will
do
well
to
content
yourself
with
a
and
perhaps
a
tin
pail
you
can
do
wonders
at
cooking
with
these
we
will
consider
the
matter
of
cooking
and
food
elsewhere
but
the
main
thing
now
is
to
know
beforehand
where
you
are
going
and
to
learn
if
there
are
houses
and
shops
on
the
route
of
course
you
must
have
food
but
if
you
have
to
carry
three
or
four
days
rations
in
your
haversack
i
fear
that
many
of
my
young
friends
will
fail
to
see
the
pleasure
of
their
trip
yet
carry
them
if
you
must
do
not
risk
starvation
whatever
you
do
also
remember
to
always
have
something
in
your
haversack
no
matter
how
easy
it
is
to
buy
what
you
want
i
have
now
enumerated
the
principal
articles
of
weight
that
a
party
must
take
on
a
when
they
camp
out
and
cook
as
they
go
if
the
trip
is
made
early
or
late
in
the
season
you
must
take
more
clothing
if
you
are
gunning
your
gun
add
still
more
weight
every
one
will
carry
towel
soap
comb
and
toothbrush
then
there
is
a
which
should
be
or
the
matches
will
soon
spoil
a
box
of
salve
the
knives
fork
spoon
dipper
portfolio
paper
testament
every
man
also
has
something
in
particular
that
he
would
be
without
for
any
thing
there
should
also
be
in
every
party
a
clothes
brush
strings
compass
and
maps
which
should
be
company
property
i
have
supposed
every
one
to
be
dressed
about
as
usual
and
have
made
allowance
only
for
extra
weight
rubber
blanket
pounds
stout
woollen
blanket
and
lining
knapsack
haversack
and
canteen
drawers
spare
shirt
socks
and
collars
half
a
and
ropes
toilet
articles
stationery
and
small
wares
food
for
one
day
total
pounds
you
may
be
able
to
reduce
the
weight
here
given
by
taking
a
lighter
blanket
and
no
knapsack
or
canteen
but
most
likely
the
food
that
you
actually
put
in
your
haversack
will
weigh
more
than
three
pounds
you
must
also
carry
your
share
of
the
following
things
and
pail
pounds
hatchet
case
and
belt
company
property
named
on
last
page
then
if
you
carry
a
heavier
kind
of
tent
than
the
shelter
or
carry
you
must
add
still
more
allow
also
nearly
three
pounds
a
day
per
man
for
food
if
you
carry
more
than
enough
for
one
day
and
remember
that
when
tents
blankets
and
clothes
get
wet
it
adds
about
a
quarter
to
their
weight
you
see
therefore
that
you
have
the
prospect
of
hard
work
i
do
not
wish
to
discourage
you
from
going
in
this
way
on
the
contrary
there
is
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
to
be
had
by
doing
so
but
the
majority
of
men
under
twenty
years
of
age
will
find
no
pleasure
in
carrying
so
much
weight
more
than
ten
miles
a
day
and
if
a
party
of
them
succeed
in
doing
so
and
in
attending
to
all
of
the
necessary
work
without
being
worse
for
it
they
will
be
fortunate
in
conclusion
then
if
you
walk
and
carry
all
your
stuff
camping
and
doing
all
your
work
and
cooking
as
you
go
you
should
travel
but
few
miles
a
day
or
better
still
should
have
many
days
when
you
do
not
move
your
camp
at
all
other
ways
of
going
afoot
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
much
about
the
other
ways
of
going
afoot
if
you
can
safely
dispense
with
cooking
and
carrying
food
much
will
be
gained
for
travel
and
observation
the
expenses
however
will
be
largely
increased
if
you
can
also
dispense
with
camping
you
ought
then
to
be
able
to
walk
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
daily
and
do
a
good
deal
of
besides
you
should
be
in
practice
however
to
do
this
you
must
know
beforehand
about
your
route
and
whether
the
country
is
settled
where
you
are
going
keep
in
mind
when
you
are
making
plans
that
it
is
easier
for
one
or
two
to
get
accommodation
at
the
farmhouses
than
for
a
larger
party
i
heard
once
of
two
fellows
who
to
avoid
buying
and
carrying
a
tent
slept
on
usually
without
permission
it
looks
to
me
as
if
those
young
men
were
candidates
for
the
penitentiary
if
you
can
not
travel
honorably
and
without
begging
i
should
advise
you
to
stay
at
home
footnotes
a
german
officer
tells
me
that
his
comrades
in
the
war
of
had
no
rubber
blankets
nor
had
they
any
such
as
our
union
soldiers
used
in
as
a
when
their
rubbers
were
lost
but
this
is
nothing
to
you
german
discipline
compelled
the
soldiers
to
carry
a
big
cloak
which
sheds
water
quite
well
and
is
useful
to
a
soldier
for
other
purposes
but
the
weight
and
bulk
condemn
it
for
in
general
it
is
better
to
put
the
in
the
roll
and
to
keep
out
the
rubber
blanket
for
you
may
need
the
last
before
you
camp
you
can
roll
the
rubber
blanket
tightly
around
the
other
roll
the
cloth
side
out
as
the
rubber
side
is
too
slippery
and
thus
be
able
to
take
it
off
readily
without
disturbing
the
other
things
you
can
also
roll
the
rubber
blanket
separately
and
link
it
to
the
large
roll
after
the
manner
of
two
links
of
a
chain
i
knew
an
officer
in
the
army
who
carried
a
rubber

it
after
his
life

his

chapter
iii
large
party
travelling
afoot
with
with
a
horse
and
wagon
to
haul
your
baggage
you
can
of
course
carry
more
first
of
all
take
another
blanket
or
two
a
light
overcoat
more
spare
clothing
an
axe
and
try
to
have
a
larger
tent
than
the
shelter
if
the
body
of
the
wagon
has
high
sides
it
will
not
be
a
very
difficult
task
to
make
a
cloth
cover
that
will
shed
water
and
you
will
then
have
what
is
almost
as
good
as
a
tent
you
can
also
put
things
under
the
wagon
you
must
have
a
cover
of
some
sort
for
your
while
on
the
march
to
prevent
injury
from
showers
that
overtake
you
and
to
keep
out
dust
and
mud
a
will
answer
for
this
purpose
you
want
also
to
carry
a
few
some
nails
tacks
straps
a
and
or
i
have
always
found
use
for
a
and
twine
and
i
carry
them
now
even
when
i
go
for
a
few
days
and
carry
all
on
my
person
the
first
drawback
that
appears
when
you
begin
to
plan
for
a
horse
and
wagon
is
the
expense
you
can
overcome
this
in
part
by
adding
members
to
your
company
but
then
you
meet
what
is
perhaps
a
still
more
serious
difficulty
the
management
of
a
large
party
another
inconvenience
of
large
numbers
is
that
each
member
must
limit
his
baggage
you
are
apt
to
accumulate
too
great
bulk
for
the
wagon
rather
than
too
great
weight
for
the
horse
where
there
are
many
there
must
be
a
captain
some
one
that
the
others
are
responsible
to
and
who
commands
their
respect
it
is
necessary
that
those
who
join
such
a
party
should
understand
that
they
ought
to
yield
to
him
whether
they
like
it
or
not
the
captain
should
always
consult
the
wishes
of
the
others
and
should
never
let
selfish
considerations
influence
him
every
day
his
decisions
as
to
what
the
party
shall
do
will
tend
to
make
some
one
dissatisfied
and
although
it
is
the
duty
of
the
dissatisfied
ones
to
yield
yet
since
submission
to
another
will
is
so
hard
the
captain
must
try
to
prevent
any
feeling
and
above
all
to
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
tyranny
system
and
order
become
quite
essential
as
our
numbers
increase
and
it
is
well
to
have
the
members
take
daily
turns
at
the
several
duties
and
during
that
day
the
captain
must
hold
each
man
to
a
strict
performance
of
his
special
trust
and
allow
no
shirking
after
a
few
days
some
of
the
party
will
show
a
willingness
to
accept
particular
burdens
all
of
the
time
and
if
these
burdens
are
the
more
disagreeable
ones
the
captain
will
do
well
to
make
the
detail
permanent
nothing
tends
to
make
ill
feeling
more
than
having
to
do
another
work
and
where
there
are
many
in
a
party
each
one
is
apt
to
leave
something
for
others
to
do
the
captain
must
be
on
the
watch
for
these
things
and
try
to
prevent
them
it
is
well
for
him
and
for
all
to
know
that
he
who
has
been
a
good
fellow
and
genial
companion
at
home
may
prove
quite
otherwise
during
a
tour
of
camping
besides
this
it
is
hardly
possible
for
a
dozen
young
men
to
be
gone
a
fortnight
on
a
trip
of
this
kind
without
some
quarrelling
and
as
this
mars
the
sport
so
much
all
should
be
careful
not
to
give
or
take
offence
if
you
are
starting
out
on
your
first
tour
keep
this
fact
constantly
in
mind
perhaps
i
can
illustrate
this
division
of
labor
we
will
suppose
a
party
of
twelve
with
one
horse
and
an
open
wagon
four
tents
a
stove
and
other
baggage
first
number
the
party
and
assign
to
each
the
duties
for
the
first
day

the
party
is
thus
arranged
in
four
squads
of
three
men
each
the
oldest
at
the
heads
one
half
of
the
party
is
actively
engaged
for
while
the
other
half
has
little
to
do
of
a
general
nature
except
that
all
must
take
turns
in
leading
the
horse
and
marching
behind
the
wagon
it
is
essential
that
this
be
done
and
it
is
best
that
only
the
stronger
members
lead
the
horse
no
takes
no
place
no
takes
no
and
so
on
and
the
first
six
have
their
in
a
few
days
each
man
will
have
shown
a
special
willingness
for
some
duty
which
by
common
consent
and
the
captain
approval
he
is
permitted
to
take
the
party
then
is
as
follows
captain
general

the
daily
detail
for
leading
the
horse
will
have
to
be
made
as
before
from
the
stronger
members
of
the
party
and
if
any
special
duty
arises
it
must
still
be
done
by
volunteering
or
by
the
captain
suggestion
in
this
arrangement
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
one
member
from
aiding
another
in
fact
where
all
are
employed
a
better
feeling
prevails
and
the
work
being
done
more
quickly
there
is
more
time
for
rest
and
enjoyment
to
get
a
horse
will
perhaps
tax
your
judgment
and
capability
as
much
as
any
thing
in
all
your
preparation
and
on
this
point
where
you
need
so
much
good
advice
i
can
only
give
you
that
of
a
general
nature
the
time
for
camping
out
is
when
horses
are
in
greatest
demand
for
farming
purposes
and
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
hire
of
any
one
except
men
whose
charges
are
so
high
that
you
can
not
afford
to
deal
with
them
you
will
have
to
hunt
a
long
time
and
in
many
places
before
you
will
find
your
animal
it
is
not
prudent
to
take
a
valuable
horse
and
i
advise
you
not
to
do
so
unless
the
owner
or
a
man
acquainted
with
horses
is
in
the
party
you
may
perhaps
be
able
to
hire
horse
wagon
and
driver
but
a
hired
man
is
an
objectionable
feature
for
besides
the
expense
such
a
man
is
usually
disagreeable
company
my
own
experience
is
that
it
is
cheaper
to
buy
a
horse
outright
and
to
hire
a
harness
and
wagon
and
since
i
am
not
a
judge
of
i
get
some
friend
who
is
to
go
with
me
and
advise
i
find
that
i
can
almost
always
buy
a
horse
even
when
i
can
not
hire
twenty
to
fifty
dollars
will
bring
as
good
an
animal
as
i
need
he
may
be
old
broken
down
spavined
or
lame
but
if
he
is
not
sickly
or
if
his
lameness
is
not
from
recent
injury
it
is
not
hard
for
him
to
haul
a
fair
load
ten
or
fifteen
miles
a
day
when
he
is
helped
over
the
hard
places
so
now
if
you
pay
fifty
dollars
for
a
horse
you
can
expect
to
sell
him
for
about
twenty
or
dollars
unless
you
were
greatly
cheated
or
have
abused
your
brute
while
on
the
trip
both
of
which
errors
you
must
be
careful
to
avoid
it
is
a
simple
matter
of
arithmetic
to
calculate
what
is
best
for
you
to
do
but
i
hope
on
this
horse
question
you
may
have
the
benefit
of
advice
from
some
one
who
has
had
experience
with
the
ways
of
the
world
you
will
need
it
very
much
wagons
if
you
have
the
choice
of
wagons
take
one
that
is
made
for
carrying
light
bulky
goods
for
your
baggage
will
be
of
that
order
one
with
a
large
body
and
high
sides
or
a
covered
wagon
will
answer
in
districts
where
the
roads
are
mountainous
rough
and
rocky
wagons
hung
on
thoroughbraces
appear
to
suit
the
people
the
best
but
you
will
have
no
serious
difficulty
with
good
steel
springs
if
you
put
in
rubber
bumpers
and
also
strap
the
body
to
the
axles
thus
preventing
the
violent
shutting
and
opening
of
the
springs
for
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
main
leaf
of
a
steel
spring
is
apt
to
break
by
the
sudden
pitching
upward
of
the
it
has
been
my
fortune
twice
to
have
to
carry
large
loads
in
small
wagons
and
it
proved
very
convenient
to
have
two
or
three
to
keep
food
and
small
articles
in
and
to
roll
the
bedding
in
rolls
three
or
four
feet
wide
which
were
packed
in
the
wagon
upon
their
ends
the
private
baggage
was
carried
in
and
the
tents
in
bags
made
expressly
to
hold
them
we
could
thus
load
the
wagon
securely
with
but
little
tying
for
wagons
with
small
and
low
bodies
it
would
be
well
to
put
a
light
rail
fourteen
to
eighteen
inches
above
the
sides
and
hold
it
there
by
six
or
eight
posts
resting
on
the
floor
and
confined
to
the
sides
of
the
body
drive
carefully
and
slowly
over
bad
places
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
whether
a
wheel
strikes
a
rock
with
the
horse
going
at
a
trot
or
at
a
walk
harness
if
your
load
is
heavy
and
the
roads
very
hard
or
the
daily
distance
long
you
had
better
have
a
collar
for
the
horse
otherwise
a
will
do
in
your
kit
of
tools
it
is
well
to
have
a
few
straps
an
awl
and
waxed
ends
against
the
time
that
something
breaks
oil
the
harness
before
you
start
and
carry
about
a
pint
of
oil
which
you
can
also
use
upon
the
men
boots
at
night
look
out
that
the
harness
and
all
of
your
baggage
are
sheltered
from
dew
and
rain
rats
and
mice
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
this
mode
of
travel
this
way
of
travelling
is
peculiarly
adapted
to
a
party
of
different
ages
rather
than
for
one
exclusively
of
young
men
it
is
especially
suitable
where
there
are
ladies
who
wish
to
walk
and
camp
or
for
an
entire
family
or
for
a
school
with
its
teachers
the
necessity
of
a
head
to
a
party
will
hardly
be
recognized
by
young
men
and
even
if
it
is
they
are
still
unwilling
as
a
general
rule
to
submit
to
unaccustomed
restraint
the
way
out
of
this
difficulty
is
for
one
man
to
invite
his
comrades
to
join
his
party
and
to
make
all
the
others
understand
from
first
to
last
that
they
are
indebted
to
him
for
the
privilege
of
going
it
is
then
somewhat
natural
for
the
invited
guests
to
look
to
their
leader
and
to
be
content
with
his
decisions
the
best
of
men
get
into
foolish
dissensions
when
off
on
a
jaunt
unless
there
is
one
whose
voice
has
authority
in
it
to
direct
the
movements
i
knew
a
party
of
twenty
or
more
that
travelled
in
this
way
and
were
directed
by
a
trio
composed
of
two
gentlemen
and
one
lady
this
arrangement
proved
satisfactory
to
all
concerned
it
has
been
assumed
in
all
cases
that
some
one
will
lead
the
horse
not
ride
in
the
loaded
wagon
and
that
two
others
will
go
behind
and
not
far
off
to
help
the
horse
over
the
very
difficult
places
as
well
as
to
have
an
eye
on
the
load
that
none
of
it
is
lost
off
or
scrapes
against
the
wheels
whoever
leads
must
be
careful
not
to
fall
under
the
horse
or
wagon
nor
to
fall
under
the
horse
feet
should
he
stumble
these
are
daily
and
hourly
risks
hence
no
small
boy
should
take
this
duty
footnotes
i
never
heard
of
a
party
exclusively
of
young
men
going
on
a
tour
of
this
kind
and
consequently
i
can
not
write
their
experiences
but
i
can
easily
imagine
their
troubles
quarrels
and
separation
into
cliques
i
once
went
as
captain
of
a
party
of
ten
composed
of
ladies
gentlemen
and
schoolboys
we
walked
around
the
white
mountains
from
north
conway
to
jefferson
and
back
by
way
of
jackson
it
cost
each
of
us
a
dollar
and
cents
a
day
for
sixteen
days
including
railroad
fares
to
and
from
portland
but
excluding
the
cost
of
clothes
tents
and
another
time
a
similar
party
of
twelve
walked
from
centre
harbor
to
bethel
in
seventeen
days
at
a
daily
cost
of
a
dollar
and
two
cents
reckoning
as
before
in
both
cases
my
right
there
was
none
to
dispute
and
by
borrowing
a
horse
the
first
time
and
selling
at
a
loss
of
only
five
dollars
the
second
our
expenses
for
the
horse
were
small
in
one
of
my
tours
around
the
mountains
a
lad
of
sixteen
in
attempting
to
hold
up
the
horse
head
as
they
were
running
down
hill
was
hit
by
the
horse
knocked
down
and
run
over
by
both
wheels
chapter
iv
clothing
if
your
means
allow
it
have
a
suit
especially
for
the
summer
tour
and
sufficiently
in
fashion
to
indicate
that
you
are
a
traveller
or
camper
shirts
loose
woollen
shirts
of
dark
colors
and
with
flowing
collars
will
probably
always
be
the
proper
thing
avoid
gaudiness
and
too
much
trimming
large
pockets
one
over
each
breast
are
handy
but
they
spoil
the
fit
of
the
shirt
and
are
always
wet
from
perspiration
i
advise
you
to
have
the
of
silesia
and
fitted
the
same
as
on
a
cotton
shirt
only
looser
then
have
a
number
of
woollen
collars
of
different
styles
if
you
choose
to
button
on
in
the
same
manner
as
a
linen
collar
you
can
thus
keep
your
neck
cool
or
warm
and
can
wash
the
collars
which
soil
so
easily
without
washing
the
whole
shirt
the
shirt
should
reach
nearly
to
the
knees
to
prevent
disorders
in
the
stomach
and
bowels
there
are
many
who
will
prefer
goods
to
for
shirts
the
former
do
not
shrink
as
much
nor
are
they
as
expensive
as
the
latter
drawers
if
you
wear
drawers
better
turn
them
inside
out
so
that
the
seams
may
not
chafe
you
they
be
loose
shoes
you
need
to
exercise
more
care
in
the
selection
of
shoes
than
of
any
other
article
of
your
outfit
tight
boots
put
an
end
to
all
pleasure
if
worn
on
the
march
heavy
boots
or
shoes
with
enormously
thick
soles
will
weary
you
thin
boots
will
not
protect
the
feet
sufficiently
and
are
liable
to
burst
or
wear
out
congress
boots
are
apt
to
bind
the
cords
of
the
leg
and
thus
make
one
lame
boots
or
shoes
hurt
the
toes
loose
ones
do
the
same
by
allowing
the
foot
to
slide
into
the
toe
of
the
boot
or
shoe
shoes
continually
fill
with
dust
sand
or
mud
for
summer
travel
i
think
you
can
find
nothing
better
than
brogans
reaching
above
the
ankles
and
fastening
by
laces
or
buttons
as
you
prefer
but
not
so
tight
as
to
bind
the
cords
of
the
foot
see
that
they
bind
nowhere
except
upon
the
instep
the
soles
should
be
wide
and
the
heels
wide
and
low
about
two
and
inches
wide
by
one
inch
high
have
soles
and
heels
well
filled
with
iron
nails
be
particular
not
to
have
steel
nails
which
slip
so
badly
on
the
rocks
common
brogans
such
as
are
sold
in
every
are
the
next
best
things
to
walk
in
but
it
is
hard
to
find
a
pair
that
will
fit
a
difficult
foot
and
they
readily
let
in
dust
and
earth
whatever
you
wear
break
them
in
well
and
oil
the
tops
thoroughly
with
oil
before
you
start
and
see
that
there
are
no
nails
either
in
sight
or
partly
covered
to
cut
your
feet
false
soles
are
a
good
thing
to
have
if
your
shoes
will
admit
them
they
help
in
keeping
the
feet
dry
and
in
drying
the
shoes
when
they
are
wet
woollen
or
merino
stockings
are
usually
preferable
to
cotton
though
for
some
feet
cotton
ones
are
by
far
the
best
any
darning
should
be
done
smoothly
since
a
bunch
in
the
stocking
is
apt
to
bruise
the
skin
pantaloons
be
sure
to
have
the
trousers
loose
and
made
of
rather
heavier
cloth
than
is
usually
worn
at
home
in
summer
they
should
be
cut
high
in
the
waist
to
cover
the
stomach
well
and
thus
prevent
sickness
the
question
of
wearing
or
using
suspenders
is
worth
some
attention
the
by
custom
is
worn
with
and
often
with
a
belt
around
the
waist
and
this
tightening
appears
to
do
no
mischief
to
the
majority
of
people
some
however
find
it
very
uncomfortable
and
others
are
speedily
attacked
by
pains
and
indigestion
in
consequence
of
having
a
tight
waist
if
you
are
in
the
habit
of
wearing
suspenders
do
not
change
now
if
you
do
not
like
to
wear
them
over
the
shirt
you
can
wear
them
over
a
light
and
have
the
suspender
straps
come
through
small
holes
in
the
in
that
case
cut
the
holes
low
enough
so
that
the
will
fold
over
the
top
of
the
trousers
and
give
the
appearance
of
if
you
undertake
to
wear
the
suspenders
next
to
the
skin
they
will
gall
you
a
fortnight
tramping
and
camping
will
about
ruin
a
pair
of
trousers
therefore
it
is
not
well
to
have
them
made
of
any
thing
very
expensive
camping
offers
a
fine
opportunity
to
wear
out
old
clothes
and
to
throw
them
away
when
you
have
done
with
them
you
can
send
home
by
mail
or
express
your
soiled
underclothes
that
are
too
good
to
lose

to
be
washed
by
your

stoves
and
if
you
have
a
permanent
camp
or
if
moving
you
have
enough
you
will
find
a
stove
to
be
most
valuable
property
if
your
party
is
large
it
is
almost
a
necessity
for
a
permanent
camp
you
can
generally
get
something
at
a
or
the
for
the
march
you
will
need
a
stove
of
sheet
iron
about
the
simplest
smallest
and
cheapest
thing
is
a
box
made
of
sheet
iron
eighteen
to
inches
long
and
nine
to
twelve
inches
high
it
needs
no
bottom
the
ground
will
answer
for
that
the
top
which
is
fixed
is
a
flat
piece
of
sheet
iron
with
a
hole
near
one
end
large
enough
for
a
pot
or
pan
and
a
hole
collar
for
the
funnel
near
the
other
end
it
is
well
also
to
have
a
small
hole
with
a
slide
to
open
and
close
it
with
in
the
end
of
the
box
near
the
bottom
so
as
to
put
in
wood
and
regulate
the
draught
but
you
can
dispense
with
the
slide
by
raising
the
stove
from
the
ground
when
you
want
to
admit
fuel
or
air
illustration
i
have
used
a
more
elaborate
article
than
this
it
is
an
old
stove
that
came
home
from
the
army
and
has
since
been
taken
down
the
coast
and
around
the
mountains
with
parties
of
ten
to
twenty
it
was
almost
an
indispensable
article
with
such
large
companies
it
is
a
box
inches
long
by
twenty
wide
and
thirteen
inches
high
with
a
slide
in
the
front
end
to
admit
air
and
fuel
the
bottom
is
fixed
to
the
body
the
top
removes
and
is
fitted
loosely
to
the
body
after
the
style
of
a
the
flange
which
is
deep
and
strong
goes
the
stove
there
are
two
holes
on
the
top
inches
in
diameter
and
two
inches
besides
the
collar
for
the
funnel
and
these
holes
have
covers
neatly
fitted
all
of
the
and
the
funnel
can
be
packed
inside
the
stove
and
if
you
fear
it
may
upset
on
the
march
you
can
tie
the
handles
of
the
stove
to
those
of
the
top
piece
a
stove
like
this
will
cost
about
ten
dollars
but
it
is
a
treasure
for
a
large
party
or
one
where
there
are
ladies
or
those
who
object
to
having
their
eyes
filled
with
smoke
the
and
for
this
stove
have
sunk
bottoms
and
hence
will
boil
quicker
by
presenting
more
surface
to
the
fire
you
should
cover
the
bottom
of
the
stove
with
four
inches
or
more
of
earth
before
making
a
fire
in
it
to
prevent
the
pots
and
kettles
from
smutting
every
thing
they
touch
each
has
a
separate
bag
in
which
it
is
packed
and
carried
the
funnel
was
in
five
joints
each
eighteen
inches
long
and
made
upon
the
telescope
principle
which
is
objectionable
on
account
of
the
smut
and
the
jams
the
funnel
is
sure
to
receive
in
practice
we
have
found
three
lengths
sufficient
but
have
had
two
elbows
made
and
with
these
we
can
use
the
stove
in
an
old
house
shed
or
tent
and
secure
good
draught
if
you
have
ladies
in
your
party
or
those
to
whom
the
rough
side
of
offers
few
attractions
it
is
well
to
consider
this
stove
question
either
of
these
here
described
must
be
handled
and
transported
with
care
a
more
substantial
article
is
the
dutch
oven
now
almost
unknown
in
many
of
the
states
it
is
simply
a
deep
bailed
with
a
heavy
cover
that
fits
on
and
overhangs
the
top
by
putting
the
oven
on
the
coals
and
making
a
fire
on
the
cover
you
can
bake
in
it
very
well
thousands
of
these
were
used
by
the
army
during
the
war
and
they
are
still
very
extensively
used
in
the
south
if
their
weight
is
no
objection
to
your
plans
i
should
advise
you
to
have
a
dutch
oven
they
are
not
expensive
if
you
can
find
one
to
buy
if
you
can
not
find
one
for
sale
see
if
you
can
not
improvise
one
in
some
way
by
getting
a
heavy
cover
for
a
deep
it
would
be
well
to
try
such
an
improvisation
at
home
before
starting
and
learn
if
it
will
bake
or
burn
before
taking
it
with
you
another
substitute
for
a
stove
is
one
much
used
nowadays
by
and
is
suited
for
permanent
camps
it
is
the
top
of
an
old
with
a
length
or
two
of
funnel
if
you
build
a
good
tight
fireplace
underneath
it
answers
pretty
well
the
objection
to
it
is
the
difficulty
of
making
and
keeping
the
fireplace
tight
and
it
smokes
badly
when
the
wind
is
not
favorable
for
draught
i
have
seen
a
great
many
of
these
in
use
but
never
knew
but
one
that
did
well
in
all
weathers
and
this
had
a
fireplace
nicely
built
of
brick
and
mortar
and
a
tight
iron
door
still
another
article
that
can
be
used
in
permanent
camps
or
if
you
have
a
wagon
is
the
yankee
baker
now
almost
unknown
you
can
easily
find
a
tinman
who
has
seen
and
can
make
one
there
is
not
however
very
often
an
occasion
for
baking
in
camp
or
at
least
most
people
prefer
to
fry
boil
or
broil
are
now
a
regular
article
of
trade
many
of
them
are
good
and
many
are
worthless
i
can
not
undertake
to
state
here
the
merits
or
demerits
of
any
particular
kind
but
before
putting
money
into
any
i
should
try
to
get
the
advice
of
some
practical
man
and
not
buy
any
thing
with
hinged
joints
or
complicated
mechanism

cooking
and
the
care
of
food
when
living
in
the
open
air
the
appetite
is
so
good
and
the
pleasure
of
getting
your
own
meals
is
so
great
that
whatever
may
be
cooked
it
is
excellent
illustration
you
will
need
a
and
a
even
if
you
are
carrying
all
your
baggage
upon
your
back
you
can
do
a
great
deal
of
good
cooking
with
these
two
utensils
after
having
had
experience
and
it
is
experience
rather
than
recipes
and
instructions
that
you
need
soldiers
in
the
field
used
to
unsolder
their
tin
canteens
and
make
two
of
them
and
i
have
seen
a
deep
plate
used
by
having
two
loops
riveted
on
the
edges
opposite
each
other
to
run
a
handle
through
food
fried
in
such
plates
needs
careful
attention
and
a
low
fire
and
as
the
plates
themselves
are
somewhat
delicate
they
can
not
be
used
roughly
illustration
it
is
far
better
to
carry
a
real
especially
if
there
are
three
or
more
in
your
party
if
you
have
transportation
or
are
going
into
a
permanent
camp
do
not
think
of
the
tin
article
a
with
a
bail
and
handle
is
better
than
one
with
a
handle
only
and
a
lip
is
better
than
a
spout
since
handles
and
spouts
are
apt
to
unsolder
young
people
are
apt
to
put
their
pot
or
on
the
burning
wood
and
it
soon
tips
over
also
they
let
the
pot
boil
over
and
presently
it
unsolders
for
want
of
water
few
think
to
keep
the
handle
so
that
it
can
be
touched
without
burning
or
smutting
and
hardly
any
young
person
knows
that
pitchy
wood
will
give
a
bad
flavor
to
any
thing
cooked
over
it
on
an
open
fire
live
coals
are
rather
better
therefore
than
the
blaze
of
a
new
fire
if
your
catches
fire
inside
do
not
get
frightened
but
take
it
off
instantly
and
blow
out
the
fire
or
smother
it
with
the
cover
or
a
board
if
you
can
not
blow
it
out
you
will
do
well
to
consult
a
if
you
wish
for
variety
in
your
cooking
but
some
things
not
found
in
i
will
give
you
here
stale
bread
dried
and
crumbs
soaked
a
few
minutes
in
water
or
better
still
in
milk
and
fried
are
all
quite
palatable
in
frying
bread
or
any
thing
else
have
the
fat
boiling
hot
before
you
put
in
the
food
this
prevents
it
from

baked
beans
beef
and

lumbermen
bake
beans
deliciously
in
an
iron
pot
that
has
a
cover
with
a
projecting
rim
to
prevent
the

from
getting
in
the
pot
the
beans
are
first
parboiled
in
one
or
two
waters
until
the
outside

begins
to

a
half

the

tablespoonfuls
of
molasses
are
put
in
and
a
little
salt
unless
the
pork
is
considerably
lean
water
enough
is
added
to
cover
the
beans
a
hole
three
feet
or
more
deep
is
dug
in
the
ground
and
heated
for
an
hour
by
a
good
hot
fire
the
coals
are
then
shovelled
out
and
the
pot
put
in
the
hole
and
immediately
buried
by
throwing
back
the
coals
and
covering
all
with
dry
earth
in
this
condition
they
are
left
to
bake
all
night
on
the
same
principle
very
tough
beef
was
cooked
in
the
army
and
made
tender
and
juicy
alternate
layers
of
beef
salt
pork
and
hard
bread
were
put
in
the
pot
covered
with
water
and
baked
all
night
in
a
hole
full
of
coals
fish
may
also
be
cooked
in
the
same
way
it
is
not
advisable
however
for
parties
less
than
six
in
number
to
trouble
themselves
to
cook
in
this
manner
care
of
food
you
had
better
butter
in
a
tight
tin
or
wooden
box
in
permanent
camp
you
can
sink
it
in
strong
brine
and
it
will
keep
some
weeks
ordinary
butter
will
not
keep
sweet
a
long
time
in
hot
weather
unless
in
a
cool
place
or
in
brine
hence
it
is
better
to
replenish
your
stock
often
if
it
is
possible
for
you
to
do
so
you
perhaps
do
not
need
to
be
told
that
when
camping
or
marching
it
is
more
difficult
to
prevent
loss
of
food
from
accidents
and
from
want
of
care
than
when
at
home
it
is
almost
daily
in
danger
from
rain
fog
or
dew
cats
and
dogs
and
from
flies
or
insects
if
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
take
a
large
quantity
of
any
thing
instead
of
supplying
yourself
frequently
you
must
pay
particular
attention
to
packing
so
that
it
shall
neither
be
spoiled
nor
spoil
any
thing
else
you
can
not
keep
meats
and
fish
fresh
for
many
hours
on
a
summer
day
but
you
may
preserve
either
over
night
if
you
will
sprinkle
a
little
salt
upon
it
and
place
it
in
a
wet
bag
of
thin
cloth
which
flies
can
not
go
through
hang
the
bag
in
a
current
of
air
and
out
of
the
reach
of
animals
in
permanent
camp
it
is
well
to
sink
a
barrel
in
the
earth
in
some
dry
shaded
place
it
will
answer
for
a
cellar
in
which
to
keep
your
food
cool
look
out
that
your
cellar
is
not
flooded
in
a
heavy
shower
and
that
ants
and
other
insects
do
not
get
into
your
food
the
lumbermen
way
of
carrying
salt
pork
is
good
they
take
a
clean
with
four
or
five
bored
in
the
bottom
near
the
chimbs
then
they
pack
the
pork
in
and
cover
it
with
coarse
salt
the
holes
let
out
what
little
brine
makes
and
thus
they
have
a
dry
tub
upon
the
pork
they
place
a
neatly
fitting
follower
with
a
cleat
or
knob
for
a
handle
and
then
put
in
such
other
eatables
as
they
choose
pork
can
be
kept
sweet
for
a
few
weeks
in
this
way
even
in
the
warmest
weather
and
by
it
you
avoid
the
continual
risk
of
upsetting
and
losing
the
brine
before
you
start
see
that
the
cover
of
the
firkin
is
neither
too
tight
nor
too
loose
so
that
wet
or
dry
weather
may
not
affect
it
too
much
i
beg
you
to
clean
and
wash
your
dishes
as
soon
as
you
have
done
using
them
instead
of
leaving
them
till
the
next
meal
remember
to
take
dishcloths
and
towels
unless
your
all
is
a
and
that
you
are
carrying
upon
your
back
when
leaves
and
grass
must
be
made
to
do
dishcloth
duty
chapter
vii
marching
it
is
generally
advised
by
medical
men
to
avoid
violent
exercise
immediately
after
eating
they
are
right
but
i
can
not
advise
you
to
rest
long
or
at
all
after
breakfast
but
rather
to
finish
what
you
could
not
do
before
the
meal
and
get
off
at
once
while
it
is
early
and
cool
do
not
hurry
or
work
hard
at
first
if
you
can
avoid
it
on
the
march
rest
often
whether
you
feel
tired
or
not
and
when
resting
see
that
you
do
rest
the
most
successful
marching
that
i
witnessed
in
the
army
was
done
by
marching
an
hour
and
resting
ten
minutes
you
need
not
adhere
strictly
to
this
rule
still
i
would
advise
you
to
halt
frequently
for
but
not
to
lie
perfectly
still
more
than
five
or
ten
minutes
as
a
reaction
is
apt
to
set
in
and
you
will
feel
fatigued
upon
rising
experience
has
shown
that
a
man
travelling
with
a
light
load
or
none
will
walk
about
three
miles
an
hour
but
you
must
not
expect
from
this
that
you
can
easily
walk
twelve
miles
in
four
heats
of
three
miles
each
with
ten
minutes
rest
between
doing
it
all
in
four
and
a
half
hours
although
it
is
by
no
means
difficult
my
advice
is
for
you
not
to
expect
to
walk
at
that
rate
even
through
a
country
that
you
do
not
care
to
see
you
may
get
so
used
to
walking
after
a
while
that
these
long
and
rapid
walks
will
not
weary
you
but
in
general
you
require
more
time
and
should
take
it
do
not
be
afraid
to
drink
good
water
as
often
as
you
feel
thirsty
but
avoid
large
draughts
of
water
when
you
are
heated
or
are
perspiring
and
never
drink
enough
to
make
yourself
logy
you
are
apt
to
break
these
rules
on
the
first
day
in
the
open
air
and
after
eating
highly
salted
food
you
can
often
satisfy
your
thirst
with
simply
rinsing
the
mouth
you
may
have
read
quite
different
advice
from
this
which
applies
to
those
who
travel
far
from
home
and
whose
daily
changes
bring
them
to
water
materially
different
from
that
of
the
day
before
it
is
well
to
have
a
lemon
in
the
haversack
or
pocket
a
drop
or
two
of
is
a
great
help
at
times
but
there
is
really
nothing
which
will
quench
the
thirst
that
comes
the
first
few
days
of
living
in
the
open
air
until
you
become
accustomed
to
the
change
and
the
fever
has
gone
down
you
should
try
to
avoid
drinking
in
a
way
that
may
prove
injurious
players
stir
a
little
oatmeal
in
the
water
they
drink
while
playing
and
it
is
said
they
receive
a
healthy
stimulus
thereby
bathing
is
not
recommended
while
upon
the
march
if
one
is
fatigued
or
has
much
farther
to
go
this
seems
to
be
good
counsel
but
i
do
advise
a
good
scrubbing
near
the
close
of
the
day
and
most
people
will
get
relief
by
frequently
washing
the
face
hands
neck
arms
and
breast
when
dusty
or
heated
although
this
is
one
of
the
things
we
used
to
hear
cried
down
in
the
army
as
hurtful
it
probably
is
so
to
some
people
if
it
hurts
you
quit
it
and
chafing
after
you
have
marched
one
day
in
the
sun
your
face
neck
and
hands
will
be
sunburnt
your
feet
sore
perhaps
blistered
your
limbs
may
be
chafed
and
when
you
wake
up
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
after
an
almost
sleepless
night
you
will
feel
as
if
you
had
been
dragged
through
seven
cities
i
am
not
aware
that
there
is
any
preventive
of
sunburn
for
skins
that
are
tender
a
hat
is
better
to
wear
than
a
cap
but
you
will
burn
under
either
oil
or
salve
on
the
exposed
parts
applied
before
marching
will
prevent
some
of
the
fire
and
in
a
few
days
if
you
keep
in
the
open
air
all
the
time
it
will
cease
to
be
annoying
to
prevent
which
is
really
the
greatest
bodily
trouble
you
will
have
to
contend
with
you
must
have
good
shoes
as
already
advised
you
must
wash
your
feet
at
least
once
a
day
and
oftener
if
they
feel
the
need
of
it
the
great
preventive
of
is
to
have
the
feet
toes
and
ankles
covered
with
oil
or
better
still
salve
or
these
seem
to
act
as
lubricators
soap
is
better
than
nothing
you
ask
if
these
do
not
soil
the
stockings
most
certainly
they
do
hence
wash
your
stockings
often
or
the
insides
of
the
shoes
will
become
foul
whenever
you
discover
the
slightest
tendency
of
the
feet
to
grow
sore
or
to
heat
put
on
oil
salve
or
soap
immediately
people
differ
as
to
these
things
to
some
a
salve
acts
as
an
irritant
to
others
soap
acts
in
the
same
way
you
must
know
before
starting
your
mother
can
tell
you
if
you
do
know
yourself
how
oil
glycerine
salve
and
soap
will
affect
your
skin
remember
the
main
thing
is
to
keep
the
feet
clean
and
lubricated
wet
feet
chafe
and
blister
more
quickly
than
dry
the
same
rule
applies
to
chafing
upon
any
part
of
the
body
wash
and
anoint
as
tenderly
as
possible
if
you
have
chafed
in
any
part
on
previous
marches
anoint
it
before
you
begin
this
when
the
soldiers
found
their
pantaloons
were
chafing
them
they
would
tie
their
handkerchiefs
around
their
pantaloons
over
the
place
affected
thus
preventing
friction
and
stopping
the
evil
but
this
is
not
advisable
for
a
permanent
preventive
a
bandage
of
cotton
or
linen
over
the
injured
part
will
serve
the
purpose
better
another
habit
of
the
soldiers
was
that
of
tucking
the
bottom
of
the
pantaloons
into
their
when
it
was
dusty
or
muddy
or
when
they
were
cold
this
is
something
worth
remembering
you
will
hardly
walk
a
week
without
having
occasion
to
try
it
leather
leggins
such
as
we
read
about
in
connection
with
alpine
travel
are
recommended
by
those
who
have
used
them
as
good
for
all
sorts
of
pedestrianism
they
have
not
come
into
use
much
as
yet
in
america
the
second
day
is
usually
the
most
fatiguing
as
before
stated
you
suffer
from
loss
of
sleep
for
few
people
can
sleep
much
the
first
night
in
camp
you
ache
from
unaccustomed
work
smart
from
sunburn
and
perhaps
your
stomach
has
gotten
out
of
order
for
these
reasons
when
one
can
choose
his
time
it
is
well
to
start
on
friday
and
so
have
sunday
come
as
a
day
of
rest
and
healing
but
this
is
not
at
all
a
necessity
if
you
do
not
try
to
do
too
much
the
first
few
days
it
is
likely
that
you
will
feel
better
on
the
third
night
than
at
any
previous
time
i
have
just
said
that
your
stomach
is
liable
to
become
disordered
you
will
be
apt
to
have
a
great
thirst
and
not
much
appetite
the
first
and
second
days
followed
by
costiveness
lame
stomach
and
a
feeling
of
weakness
or
exhaustion
as
a
preventive
eat
laxative
foods
on
those
days
figs
are
especially
good
and
try
not
to
work
too
hard
you
should
lay
your
plans
so
as
not
to
have
much
to
do
nor
far
to
go
at
first
do
not
dose
with
medicines
nor
take
alcoholic
stimulants
physic
and
alcohol
may
give
a
temporary
relief
but
they
will
leave
you
in
bad
condition
and
here
let
me
say
that
there
is
little
or
no
need
of
spirits
in
your
party
you
will
find
coffee
or
tea
far
better
than
alcohol
avoid
all
nonsensical
waste
of
strength
and
gymnastic
feats
before
and
during
the
march
play
no
jokes
upon
your
comrades
that
will
make
their
day
work
more
burdensome
young
people
are
very
apt
to
forget
these
things
let
each
comrade
finish
his
morning
nap
a
man
can
not
dispense
with
sleep
and
it
is
cruel
to
rob
a
friend
of
what
is
almost
his
life
and
health
but
if
any
one
of
your
party
requires
more
sleep
than
the
others
he
ought
to
contrive
to
turn
in
earlier
and
so
rise
with
the
company
you
have
already
been
advised
to
take
all
the
rest
you
can
at
the
halts
unsling
the
knapsack
or
take
off
your
pack
unless
you
lie
down
upon
it
and
make
yourself
as
comfortable
as
you
can
avoid
sitting
in
a
draught
of
air
or
wherever
it
chills
you
if
you
feel
on
the
second
morning
as
if
you
could
never
reach
your
journey
end
start
off
easily
and
you
will
limber
up
after
a
while
the
great
trouble
with
young
people
is
that
they
are
ashamed
to
own
their
fatigue
and
will
not
do
any
thing
that
looks
like
a
confession
but
these
rules
about
resting
and
taking
it
easy
are
the
same
in
principle
as
those
by
which
a
horse
is
driven
on
a
long
journey
and
it
seems
reasonable
that
young
men
should
be
favored
as
much
as
horses
try
to
be
civil
and
gentlemanly
to
every
one
you
will
find
many
who
wish
to
make
money
out
of
you
especially
around
the
summer
hotels
and
avoid
them
if
you
can
make
your
prices
where
possible
before
you
engage
do
not
be
saucy
to
the
farmers
nor
treat
them
as
country
greenhorns
there
is
not
a
class
of
people
in
the
country
of
more
importance
to
you
in
your
travels
and
you
are
in
honor
bound
to
be
respectful
to
them
avoid
stealing
their
apples
or
disturbing
any
thing
and
when
you
wish
to
camp
near
a
house
or
on
cultivated
land
obtain
permission
from
the
owner
and
do
not
make
any
unreasonable
request
such
as
asking
to
camp
in
a
man
or
to
make
a
fire
in
dry
grass
or
within
a
hundred
yards
of
his
buildings
do
not
ask
him
to
wait
on
you
without
offering
to
pay
him
most
farmers
object
to
having
people
sleep
on
their
and
all
who
permit
it
will
insist
upon
the
rule
no
smoking
allowed
here
when
you
break
camp
in
the
morning
be
sure
to
put
out
the
fires
wherever
you
are
and
if
you
have
camped
on
cleared
land
see
that
the
fences
and
gates
are
as
you
found
them
and
do
not
leave
a
mass
of
rubbish
behind
for
the
farmer
to
clear
up
mountain
climbing
when
you
climb
a
mountain
make
up
your
mind
for
hard
work
unless
there
is
a
or
the
mountain
is
low
and
of
gentle
ascent
if
possible
make
your
plans
so
that
you
will
not
have
to
carry
much
up
and
down
the
steep
parts
it
is
best
to
camp
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
or
a
part
way
up
and
leaving
the
most
of
your
baggage
there
to
take
an
early
start
next
morning
so
as
to
go
up
and
down
the
same
day
this
is
not
a
necessity
however
but
if
you
camp
on
the
you
run
more
risk
from
cold
fog
clouds
and
showers
and
you
need
a
warmer
camp
and
more
clothing
than
down
below
often
there
is
no
water
near
the
top
therefore
to
be
on
the
safe
side
it
is
best
to
carry
a
canteen
after
wet
weather
and
early
in
the
summer
you
can
often
squeeze
a
little
water
from
the
moss
that
grows
on
it
is
so
apt
to
be
chilly
cloudy
or
showery
at
the
summit
that
you
should
take
a
rubber
blanket
and
some
other
article
of
clothing
to
put
on
if
needed
although
a
man
may
sometimes
ascend
a
mountain
and
stay
on
the
top
for
hours
in
his
it
is
never
advisable
to
go
so
thinly
clad
oftener
there
is
need
of
an
overcoat
while
the
air
in
the
valley
is
uncomfortably
warm
do
not
wear
the
extra
clothing
in
ascending
but
keep
it
to
put
on
when
you
need
it
this
rule
is
general
for
all
extra
clothing
you
will
find
it
much
better
to
carry
than
to
wear
it
remember
that
is
excessively
fatiguing
hence
go
slowly
make
short
rests
often
eat
nothing
between
meals
and
drink
sparingly
there
are
few
mountains
that
it
is
advisable
for
ladies
to
try
to
climb
where
there
is
a
road
or
the
way
is
open
and
not
too
steep
they
may
attempt
it
but
to
climb
over
loose
rocks
and
through
for
miles
is
too
difficult

the
camp
it
pays
well
to
take
some
time
to
find
a
good
spot
for
a
camp
if
you
are
only
to
stop
one
night
it
matters
not
so
much
but
even
then
you
should
camp
on
a
dry
spot
near
wood
and
water
and
where
your
horse
if
you
have
one
can
be
well
cared
for
look
out
for
rotten
trees
that
may
fall
see
that
a
sudden
rain
will
not
drown
you
out
and
do
not
put
your
tent
near
the
road
as
it
frightens
horses
for
a
permanent
camp
a
good
prospect
is
very
desirable
yet
i
would
not
sacrifice
all
other
things
to
this
if
you
have
to
carry
your
baggage
any
distance
by
hand
you
will
find
it
convenient
to
use
two
poles
will
serve
as
a
upon
which
to
pile
and
carry
your
stuff
a
floor
to
the
tent
is
a
luxury
in
which
some
indulge
when
in
permanent
camp
it
is
not
a
necessity
of
course
but
in
a
tent
occupied
by
ladies
or
children
it
adds
much
to
their
comfort
to
have
a
few
boards
an
old
door
or
something
of
that
sort
to
step
on
when
dressing
boards
or
at
the
door
of
the
tent
partly
prevent
your
bringing
mud
inside
if
you
are
on
a
hillside
pitch
your
tent
so
that
when
you
sleep
if
you
are
to
sleep
on
the
ground
your
feet
will
be
lower
than
your
head
you
will
roll
all
night
and
perhaps
roll
out
of
the
tent
if
you
lie
across
the
line
running
down
hill
as
soon
as
you
have
pitched
your
tent
stretch
a
stout
line
from
the
front
pole
to
the
back
one
near
the
top
upon
which
to
hang
your
clothes
you
can
tighten
this
line
by
pulling
inwards
the
foot
of
one
pole
before
tying
the
line
and
then
lifting
it
back
do
not
put
your
clothes
and
bedding
upon
the
bare
ground
they
grow
damp
very
quickly
see
too
that
the
food
is
where
ants
will
not
get
at
it
do
not
forget
to
take
two
or
three
candles
and
replenish
your
stock
if
you
burn
them
they
sometimes
are
a
prime
necessity
also
do
not
pack
them
where
you
can
not
easily
find
them
in
the
dark
in
a
permanent
camp
you
may
be
tempted
to
use
a
lantern
with
oil
and
perhaps
you
will
like
it
better
than
candles
but
when
moving
about
the
and
will
give
you
trouble
if
you
have
no
candlestick
handy
you
can
use
your
putting
one
blade
in
the
bottom
or
side
of
the
candle
and
another
blade
into
the
ground
or
you
can
quickly
cut
a
candlestick
out
of
a
potato
or
can
drive
four
nails
in
a
block
of
wood
if
your
candles
get
crushed
or
if
you
have
no
candles
but
have
grease
without
salt
in
it
you
can
easily
make
a
slut
by
putting
the
grease
in
a
small
shallow
pan
or
saucer
with
a
piece
of
wicking
or
cotton
rag
one
end
of
which
shall
be
in
the
grease
and
the
other
which
you
light
held
out
of
it
this
is
a
poor
substitute
for
daylight
and
i
advise
you
to
rise
and
retire
early
or
and
if
you
prefer
you
will
then
have
more
daylight
than
you
need
beds
time
used
in
making
a
bed
is
well
spent
never
let
yourself
be
persuaded
that
humps
and
hollows
are
good
enough
for
a
tired
man
if
you
cut
boughs
do
not
let
large
sticks
go
into
the
bed
only
put
in
the
smaller
twigs
and
leaves
try
your
bed
before
you
turn
in
and
see
if
it
is
comfortable
in
a
permanent
camp
you
ought
to
take
time
enough
to
keep
the
bed
soft
and
i
like
best
for
this
purpose
to
carry
a
mattress
when
i
can
or
to
take
a
sack
and
fill
it
with
straw
shavings
boughs
or
what
not
this
makes
a
much
better
bed
and
can
be
taken
out
daily
to
the
air
and
sun
by
this
i
avoid
the
clutter
there
always
is
inside
a
tent
filled
with
boughs
and
more
than
all
the
ground
or
floor
does
not
mould
in
damp
weather
from
the
accumulation
of
rubbish
on
it
it
is
better
to
sleep
off
the
ground
if
you
can
especially
if
you
are
rheumatic
for
this
purpose
build
some
sort
of
a
platform
ten
inches
or
more
high
that
will
do
for
a
seat
in
daytime
you
can
make
a
sort
of
spring
bottom
affair
if
you
can
find
the
poles
for
it
and
have
a
little
ingenuity
and
patience
or
you
can
more
quickly
drive
four
large
stakes
and
nail
a
framework
to
them
to
which
you
can
nail
boards
or
all
this
kind
of
work
must
be
strong
or
you
can
have
no
sport
on
it
we
used
to
see
in
the
army
sometimes
a
mattress
with
a
bottom
of
rubber
cloth
and
a
top
of
heavy
drilling
with
rather
more
cotton
quilted
between
them
than
is
put
into
a
thick
comforter
such
a
mattress
is
a
fine
thing
to
carry
in
a
wagon
when
you
are
on
the
march
but
you
can
make
a
softer
bed
than
this
if
you
are
in
a
permanent
camp
sleeping
turn
in
early
so
as
to
be
up
with
the
sun
you
may
be
tempted
to
sleep
in
your
clothes
but
if
you
wish
to
know
what
luxury
is
take
them
off
as
you
do
at
home
and
sleep
in
a
sheet
having
first
taken
a
bath
or
at
least
washed
the
feet
and
limbs
not
many
care
to
do
this
particularly
if
the
evening
air
is
chilly
but
it
is
a
comfort
of
no
mean
order
if
you
are
short
of
bedclothes
as
when
on
the
march
you
can
place
over
you
the
clothes
you
take
off
see
but
in
that
case
it
is
still
more
necessary
to
have
a
good
bed
underneath
you
will
always
do
well
to
cover
the
clothes
you
have
taken
off
or
they
will
be
quite
damp
in
the
morning
see
that
you
have
plenty
of
air
to
breathe
it
is
not
best
to
have
a
draught
of
air
sweeping
through
the
tent
but
let
a
plenty
of
it
come
in
at
the
feet
of
the
sleeper
or
top
of
the
tent
a
hammock
is
a
good
thing
to
have
in
a
permanent
camp
but
do
not
try
to
swing
it
between
two
it
needs
a
firmer
support
stretch
a
somewhere
on
your
where
neither
you
nor
your
visitors
will
run
into
it
in
the
dark
if
your
camp
is
where
many
visitors
will
come
by
carriage
you
will
find
that
it
will
pay
you
for
your
trouble
to
provide
a
where
the
horses
can
stand
safely
fastening
to
and
is
dangerous
sinks
in
a
permanent
camp
you
must
be
careful
to
deposit
all
refuse
from
the
kitchen
and
table
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
otherwise
your
camp
will
be
infested
with
flies
and
the
air
will
become
polluted
these
may
be
small
and
dug
every
day
or
large
and
partly
filled
every
day
or
oftener
by
throwing
earth
over
the
deposits
if
you
wish
for
health
and
comfort
do
not
suffer
a
place
to
exist
in
your
camp
that
will
toll
flies
to
it
the
sinks
should
be
some
distance
from
your
tents
and
a
dry
spot
of
land
is
better
than
a
wet
one
observe
the
same
rule
in
regard
to
all
excrementitious
and
urinary
matter
on
the
march
you
can
hardly
do
better
than
follow
the
mosaic
law
see
deuteronomy
xxiii
in
permanent
camp
or
if
you
propose
to
stay
anywhere
more
than
three
days
the
crumbs
from
the
table
and
the
kitchen
refuse
should
be
carefully
looked
after
to
this
end
it
is
well
to
avoid
eating
in
the
tents
where
you
live
swarms
of
flies
will
be
attracted
by
a
very
little
food
a
spade
is
better
all
things
considered
than
a
shovel
either
in
permanent
camp
or
on
the
march
how
to
keep
warm
when
a
cold
and
wet
spell
of
weather
overtakes
you
you
will
inquire
how
can
we
keep
warm
if
you
are
where
wood
is
very
abundant
you
can
build
a
big
fire
ten
or
fifteen
feet
from
the
tent
and
the
heat
will
strike
through
the
cloth
this
is
the
poorest
way
and
if
you
have
only
your
case
is
still
more
forlorn
but
keep
the
fire
you
make
green
wood
burn
through
a
pelting
storm
but
you
must
have
a
quantity
of
it
say
six
or
eight
large
logs
on
at
one
time
you
must
look
out
for
storms
and
have
some
wood
cut
beforehand
if
you
have
a
stove
with
you
a
little
ingenuity
will
enable
you
to
set
it
up
inside
a
tent
and
run
the
funnel
through
the
door
but
unless
your
funnel
is
quite
long
you
will
have
to
improvise
one
to
carry
the
smoke
away
for
the
eddies
around
the
tent
will
make
the
stove
smoke
occasionally
beyond
all
endurance
since
you
will
need
but
little
fire
to
keep
you
warm
you
can
use
a
funnel
made
of
boards
old
spout
and
the
like
old
tin
cans
and
stout
paper
can
be
made
to
do
service
as
elbows
with
the
assistance
of
turf
and
large
leaves
but
i
forewarn
you
there
is
not
much
fun
either
in
rigging
your
stove
and
funnel
or
in
sitting
by
it
and
waiting
for
the
storm
to
blow
it
down
still
it
is
best
to
be
busy
another
way
to
keep
warm
is
to
dig
a
trench
twelve
to
eighteen
inches
wide
and
about
two
feet
deep
running
from
inside
to
the
outside
of
the
tent
the
inside
end
of
the
trench
should
be
larger
and
deeper
here
you
build
your
fire
you
cover
the
trench
with
flat
rocks
and
fill
up
the
chinks
with
stones
and
turf
boards
can
be
used
after
you
have
gone
a
few
feet
from
the
fireplace
over
the
outer
end
build
some
kind
of
a
chimney
of
stones
boxes
boards
or
barrels
the
fireplace
should
not
be
near
enough
to
the
side
of
the
tent
to
endanger
it
and
the
taller
the
chimney
is
the
better
it
will
draw
if
you
have
made
the
trench
of
good
width
and
if
you
can
find
a
covering
for
the
fireplace
you
will
be
fortunate
for
the
main
difficulty
in
this
is
to
give
it
draught
enough
without
letting
out
smoke
and
this
you
can
not
easily
arrange
with
rocks
in
digging
your
trench
and
fireplace
make
them
so
that
the
rain
shall
not
flood
them
fireplace
if
flat
rocks
and
mud
are
plenty
you
can
perhaps
build
a
fireplace
at
the
door
of
your
tent
outside
of
course
and
you
will
then
have
something
both
substantial
and
valuable
fold
one
flap
of
the
door
as
far
back
as
you
can
and
build
one
side
of
the
fireplace
against
the
pole
and
the
other
side
against
or
nearly
over
to
the
corner
of
the
tent
use
large
rocks
for
the
lower
tiers
and
try
to
have
all
three
walls
perpendicular
and
smooth
inside
when
up
about
three
feet
or
as
high
as
the
flap
of
the
tent
will
allow
without
its
being
scorched
put
on
a
large
log
of
green
wood
for
a
mantle
or
use
an
iron
bar
if
you
have
one
and
go
on
building
the
chimney
do
not
narrow
it
much
the
chimney
should
be
as
high
as
the
top
of
the
tent
or
eddies
of
wind
will
blow
down
occasionally
and
smoke
you
out
barrels
or
boxes
will
do
for
the
top
or
you
can
make
a
of
split
sticks
well
daubed
with
mud
all
the
work
of
the
fireplace
and
chimney
must
be
made
by
filling
the
chinks
with
stones
or
chips
and
mud
when
done
fold
and
confine
the
flap
of
the
tent
against
the
stonework
and
the
mantle
better
tie
than
nail
as
iron
rusts
the
cloth
do
not
cut
the
tent
either
for
this
or
any
other
purpose
you
will
regret
it
if
you
do
keep
water
handy
if
there
is
much
woodwork
and
do
not
leave
your
tent
for
a
long
time
nor
go
to
sleep
with
a
big
fire
blazing
if
you
have
to
bring
much
water
into
camp
remember
that
two
pails
carry
about
as
easily
as
a
single
one
provided
you
have
a
hoop
between
to
keep
them
away
from
your
legs
to
prevent
the
water
from
splashing
put
something
inside
the
pail
that
will
float
nearly
as

covered
with

difficult
in

unless
you
are
accustomed
to
using

if
you
go
into

without
an
axeman
you
had
better
rely
upon
your
tents

build

there
is

you
have
a

larger
shelter

this
arrangement
of
the

when
it
is
pitched
in
the
regular
way

there
is
the
additional
advantage
of
having
a
large
front
exposed
to

you
will
probably
build

the

time

chapter
ix
army
the
used
by
the
union
soldiers
during
the
rebellion
was
made
of
light
duck
about
inches
wide
a
tent
was
made
in
two
pieces
both
precisely
alike
and
each
of
them
five
feet
long
and
five
feet

two
widths

was
given
to
every
soldier
that
edge
of
the
piece
which
was
the
bottom
of
the
tent
was
faced
at
the
corners
with
a
piece
of
stouter
duck
three
or
four
inches
square
the
seam
in
the
middle
of
the
piece
was
also
faced

eyelets
were
worked
at
these

places
through
which
stout
cords

ropes
could
be
run
to

this

eight
inches
were
and
buttons
the
holes
an
inch
and
the
buttons
four
inches
from
the
selvage
or
hem
two
men
could
button
their
pieces
at
the
tops
and
thus
make
a
tent
entirely
open
at
both
ends
five
feet
and
two
inches
long
by
six
to
seven
feet
wide
according
to
the
angle
of
the
roof
a
third
man
could
button
his
piece
across
one
of
the
open
ends
so
as
to
close
it
although
it
did
not
make
a
very
neat
fit
and
half
of
the
cloth
was
not
used
four
men
could
unite
their
two
tents
by
buttoning
the
ends
together
thus
doubling
the
length
of
the
tent
and
a
fifth
man
could
put
in
an
light
poles
made
in
two
pieces
and
fastened
together
with
ferrules
so
as
to
resemble
a
piece
of
were
given
to
some
of
the
troops
when
the
tents
were
first
introduced
into
the
army
but
nice
as
they
were
at
the
end
of
the
march
few
soldiers
would
carry
them
nor
will
you
many
days
the
tents
were
also
pitched
by
throwing
them
over
a
tightened
rope
but
it
was
easier
to
a
stiff
pole
than
to
either
the
pole
or
rope
you
need
not
confine
yourself
exactly
to
the
dimensions
of
the
army
but
for
a
pedestrian
something
of
the
sort
is
necessary
if
he
will
camp
out
i
have
never
seen
a
shelter
made
of
breadths
of
drilling
seven
feet
three
inches
long
but
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
four
or
five
men
to
take
and
i
should
recommend
that
they
make
instead
of
taking
additional
complete
for
in
the
latter
case
of
the
cloth
is
useless
five
feet
is
enough
for
a
tent
made
on
the
shelter
principle
when
pitched
with
the
roof
at
a
right
angle
it
is
feet
high
and
nearly
seven
feet
wide
on
the
ground
although
a
is
a
poor
substitute
for
a
house
it
is
as
good
a
protection
as
you
can
well
carry
if
you
propose
to
walk
any
distance
it
should
be
pitched
neatly
or
it
will
leak
in
heavy
pelting
rains
a
fine
spray
will
come
through
on
the
windward
side
the
sides
should
set
at
right
angles
to
each
other
or
at
a
sharper
angle
if
rain
is
expected
there
are
rubber
blankets
made
with
eyelets
along
the
edges
so
that
two
can
be
tied
together
to
make
a
tent
but
they
are
heavier
more
expensive
and
not
much
if
any
better
and
you
will
need
other
rubber
blankets
to
lie
upon
if
you
wish
for
a
larger
and
more
substantial
covering
than
a
shelter
and
propose
to
do
the
work
yourself
you
will
do
well
to
have
a
sailmaker
or
a
cut
the
cloth
and
show
you
how
the
work
is
to
be
done
if
you
can
not
have
their
help
you
must
at
least
have
the
assistance
of
one
used
to
planning
and
cutting
to
whom
the
following
hints
may
not
be
lost
we
will
suppose
heavy
drilling
inches
wide
to
be
used
in
all
instances
the
to
make
an
draw
upon
the
floor
a
straight
line
seven
feet
long
to
represent
the
upright
pole
or
height
of
the
tent
then
draw
a
line
at
right
angles
to
and
across
the
end
of
the
first
one
to
represent
the
ground
or
bottom
of
the
tent
complete
the
plan
by
finding
where
the
corners
will
be
on
the
ground
line
and
drawing
the
two
sides
roof
from
the
corners
to
the
top
of
the
this
triangle
is
a
trifle
larger
than
the
front
and
back
of
the
tent
will
be
the
cloth
should
be
cut
so
that
the
twilled
side
shall
be
the
outside
of
the
tent
as
it
sheds
the
rain
better
place
the
cloth
on
the
floor
against
the
and
tack
it
to
hold
it
fast
to
the
which
it
should
overlap
of
an
inch
then
cut
by
the
turn
the
cloth
over
and
cut
another
piece
exactly
like
the
first
this
second
piece
will
go
on
the
back
of
the
tent
now
place
the
cloth
against
the
as
before
but
upon
the
other
side
of
the
pole
and
tack
it
to
the
floor
after
you
have
overlapped
the
selvage
of
the
piece
first
cut
of
an
inch
cut
by
the
and
turn
and
cut
again
for
the
back
of
the
tent
in
cutting
the
four
small
gores
for
the
corners
you
can
get
all
the
cloth
from
one
piece
and
thus
save
waste
by
turning
and
tearing
it
in
two
these
also
overlap
the
longer
breadths
of
an
inch
the
three
breadths
that
make
the
sides
or
roof
are
cut
all
alike
their
length
is
found
by
measuring
the
plan
from
corner
to
corner
over
the
top
in
the
plan
now
under
consideration
the
distance
will
be
nearly
sixteen
feet
when
you
sew
them
overlap
the
breadths
of
an
inch
the
same
as
you
do
the
in
sewing
you
can
do
no
better
than
to
run
with
a
machine
a
row
of
stitching
as
near
each
selvage
as
possible
you
will
thus
have
two
rows
to
each
seam
which
makes
it
strong
enough
use
the
coarsest
cotton
no
or
the
sides
and
two
ends
are
made
separately
when
you
sew
them
together
care
must
be
taken
for
the
edges
of
the
ends
are
cut
and
will
stretch
very
much
more
than
the
cloth
of
the
sides
roof
about
as
good
a
seam
as
you
can
make
in
sewing
together
the
sides
and
ends
is
to
place
the
two
edges
together
and
fold
them
outwards
or
what
will
be
downwards
when
the
tent
is
pitched
twice
a
quarter
of
an
inch
each
time
and
put
two
rows
of
stitching
through
if
done
on
a
machine
or
one
if
with
and
twine
this
folding
the
cloth
besides
making
a
good
seam
strengthens
the
tent
where
the
greatest
strain
comes
it
is
also
advisable
to
put
facings
in
the
two
ends
of
the
top
of
the
tent
to
prevent
the
poles
from
pushing
through
and
chafing
the
bottom
of
the
tent
is
completed
next
by
folding
upwards
and
inwards
two
inches
of
cloth
to
make
what
is
called
a
tabling
and
again
folding
in
the
raw
edge
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
as
is
usual
to
make
a
neat
job
some
makers
enclose
a
marline
or
other
small
tarred
rope
to
strengthen
the
foot
of
the
tent
and
it
is
well
to
do
so
one
edge
of
what
is
called
the
is
folded
in
with
the
raw
edge
and
stitched
at
the
same
time
this
cloth
which
is
six
to
eight
inches
wide
runs
entirely
around
the
bottom
of
the
tent
excepting
the
and
prevents
a
current
of
air
from
sweeping
under
the
tent
and
saves
the
bottom
from
rotting
the
however
will
rot
or
wear
out
instead
but
you
can
replace
it
much
more
easily
than
you
can
repair
the
bottom
of
the
tent
consequently
it
is
best
to
put
one
on
one
door
is
enough
in
an
but
if
you
prefer
two
be
sure
that
one
at
least
is
nicely
fitted
and
well
provided
with
tapes
or
buttons
or
both
otherwise
you
will
have
a
cheerless
tent
in
windy
and
rainy
weather
the
is
usually
made
of
a
strip
of
cloth
six
to
nine
inches
wide
sewed
to
the
selvage
of
the
breadth
that
laps
inside
the
top
of
it
is
sewed
across
the
inside
of
the
other
breadth
and
reaches
to
the
corner
seam
usually
determine
the
height
of
the
door
by
having
the
top
of
the
flap
reach
from
selvage
to
seam
as
just
described
the
narrower
the
flap
is
the
higher
the
door
will
be
some
make
the
considerably
wider
at
the
bottom
than
at
the
top
and
thus
provide
against
the
many
annoyances
that
arise
from
one
too
narrow
the
loops
or
beckets
as
they
are
called
that
fasten
to
the
are
put
in
one
at
each
side
of
the
door
and
at
every
seam
some
makers
work
an
eyelet
or
put
a
grommet
in
the
seam
but
in
the
which
are
made
of
duck
there
are
two
eyelets
worked
one
on
each
side
of
the
seam
and
a
manilla
rope
is
run
through
and
held
in
by
knotting
the
ends
the
door
is
tied
together
by
two
double
rows
of
stout
tapes
sewed
on
at
intervals
of
about
eighteen
inches
one
inside
the
tent
ties
the
to
the
opposite
breadth
and
a
second
set
outside
pulls
together
the
two
selvages
of
the
centre
breadths
do
not
slight
this
work
a
door
short
tapes
and
a
that
is
slapping
all
the
time
are
things
that
will
annoy
you
beyond
endurance
the
upright
poles
of
a
tent
such
as
has
been
described
should
be
an
inch
or
two
more
than
seven
feet
for
the
cloth
will
stretch
if
you
have
a
the
poles
should
be
longer
still
the
the
is
shaped
like
a
house
the
walls
or
sides
which
are
perpendicular
are
four
feet
high
a
continuous
piece
of
cloth
runs
from
the
ground
to
the
eaves
thence
on
toward
the
ridgepole
and
down
the
other
side
to
the
ground
the
tent
is
made
on
the
same
general
principles
as
the
one
last
described
it
is
four
breadths
square
but
the
width
is
usually
diminished
about
one
foot
by
cutting
six
inches
from
each
corner
breadth
if
the
cloth
is
drilling
or
light
duck
you
can
overlap
the
centre
breadths
a
foot
and
thus
have
the
doors
draw
a
plan
upon
the
floor
as
in
the
other
case
the
pole
nine
feet
and
two
inches
high
the
corners
four
breadths
apart
less
the
overlappings
and
the
narrowing
draw
the
wall
in
the
plan
only
four
feet
and
two
inches
high
the
runs
of
course
from
the
top
of
the
pole
to
the
top
of
the
wall
cut
the
cloth
as
before
so
as
to
have
the
twilled
side
out
add
six
inches
to
the
distance
measured
on
the
plan
for
the
length
of
the
walls
and
roof
so
as
to
get
cloth
for
the
eaves
the
wall
is
to
be
four
feet
high
consequently
when
you
have
sewed
together
the
four
breadths
that
make
the
roof
and
walls
measure
four
feet
inches
from
the
ends
bottoms
double
the
cloth
and
sew
two
rows
of
stitching
by
hand
across
from
side
to
side
inches
from
the
doubling
this
makes
the
tabling
for
the
eaves
and
you
have
two
inches
left
for
the
bottom
tabling
use
stout
twine
for
these
seams
at
the
eaves
and
take
only
three
to
four
stitches
to
the
inch
take
the
same
care
as
before
in
sewing
together
the
ends
and
sides
the
larger
the
tent
the
more
this
difficulty
increases
the
becomes
more
of
a
necessity
as
we
increase
the
size
of
the
tent
and
add
to
the
difficulty
of
making
it
fit
snugly
to
the
ground
facings
should
be
put
in
where
the
ends
of
the
poles
bear
as
before
explained
and
also
in
the
four
upper
corners
of
the
wall
to
prevent
the
strain
of
the
corner
from
ripping
apart
the
eaves
and
wall
beckets
must
be
put
in
the
bottom
of
each
seam
and
the
door
the
same
as
in
the
and
strong
tapes
sewed
to
the
door
made
of
manilla
rope
are
put
in
at
the
four
corners
of
the
eaves
and
at
every
seam
along
that
tabling
making
five
upon
each
side
work
an
eyelet
or
put
a
grommet
in
the
doubled
cloth
of
the
seam
knot
the
end
of
the
to
prevent
its
pulling
through
tying
the
rope
makes
too
bungling
a
job
and
splicing
it
is
too
much
work
the
six
in
the
body
of
the
tent
should
be
about
nine
feet
long
the
four
corner
ones
about
a
foot
longer
the
fiddles
should
be
made
of
some
firm
wood
pine
and
spruce
will
not
last
long
enough
to
pay
for
the
trouble
of
making
them
the
poles
should
be
nine
feet
and
four
or
five
inches
long
if
they
are
too
long
at
first
sink
the
ends
in
the
ground
and
do
not
cut
them
off
until
the
tent
has
stretched
all
that
it
will
in
permanent
camp
a
fly
over
the
tent
is
almost
indispensable
for
protection
from
the
heat
and
pelting
rains
it
should
be
as
long
as
the
roof
of
the
tent
and
project
at
least
a
foot
beyond
the
eaves
the
should
be
a
foot
or
more
longer
than
those
of
the
tent
so
that
the
pins
for
the
fly
may
be
driven
some
distance
outside
those
of
the
tent
and
thus
lift
the
fly
well
off
the
roof
cloth
for
tents
for
convenience
we
have
supposed
all
of
the
tents
to
be
made
of
heavy
drilling
many
consider
this
material
sufficiently
strong
and
some
even
use
it
to
make
tents
larger
than
the
united
states
army
my
own
experience
leads
me
to
recommend
for
a
a
heavier
cloth
known
to
the
trade
as
raven
duck
because
drilling
becomes
so
thin
after
it
has
been
used
two
or
three
seasons
that
a
high
wind
is
apt
to
tear
it
the
cost
of
the
cloth
is
about
the
same
as
the
value
of
the
labor
of
making
the
tent
but
the
difference
between
the
cost
of
drilling
and
duck
for
a
of
four
breadths
with
a
fly
is
only
three
to
four
dollars
and
the
duck
tent
will
last
nearly
twice
as
long
as
the
one
of
drilling
for
these
reasons
it
seems
best
not
to
put
your
labor
into
the
inferior
cloth
before
you
use
the
tent
or
expose
to
the
weather
any
thing
made
of
cotton
cloth
you
should
wash
it
thoroughly
in
strong
and
then
soak
it
in
strong
brine
this
takes
the
sizing
and
oil
out
of
the
cloth
and
if
repeated
from
year
to
year
will
prevent
mildew
which
soon
spoils
the
cloth
there
are
mixtures
that
are
said
to
be
better
still
but
a
assures
me
that
the
yearly
washing
is
better
than
any
thing
applied
only
once
some
fishermen
preserve
their
sails
by
soaking
them
in
a
solution
of
lime
and
water
considerably
thinner
than
whitewash
others
soak
them
in
a
tanner
vat
but
the
color
imparted
is
not
pleasing
to
the
eye
weak
they
say
does
not
injure
cotton
but
it
ruins
rope
and
leather
and
some
complain
that
it
rots
the
thread
it
will
save
strain
upon
any
tent
to
stay
it
in
windy
weather
with
ropes
running
from
the
iron
pins
of
the
upright
poles
which
should
project
through
the
ridgepole
and
top
of
the
tent
to
the
ground
in
front
and
rear
of
the
tent
a
still
better
way
is
to
run
four
ropes
from
the
top
two
from
each
down
to
the
ground
near
the
of
the
four
corner
the
two
stays
from
the
rear
pole
should
run
toward
the
front
of
the
tent
and
the
two
front
stays
toward
the
rear
crossing
the
other
two
the
tent
is
then
stayed
against
a
wind
from
any
quarter
and
the
stays
and
are
all
together
on
the
sides
of
the
tent
loosen
the
stays
and
a
little
at
night
or
when
rain
is
approaching
so
as
to
prevent
them
from
straining
the
tent
by
shrinking
around
the
bottom
of
any
tent
you
should
dig
a
small
trench
to
catch
and
convey
away
the
water
when
it
rains
and
i
caution
you
against
the
error
which
even
old
campers
sometimes
make
do
not
try
to
have
the
water
run
up
hill
how
to
pitch
a
quickly
after
you
have
once
pitched
the
tent
and
have
put
the
poles
and
pins
in
their
exact
places
note
the
distance
from
one
of
the
upright
poles
to
the
pin
holding
one
of
the
nearest
corner
and
then
mark
one
of
the
poles
in
such
a
way
that
you
can
tell
by
it
what
that
distance
is
when
you
next
wish
to
pitch
the
tent
drive
two
small
pins
in
the
ground
where
the
two
upright
poles
are
to
rest
the
ridgepole
will
tell
you
how
far
apart
they
must
be
then
by
measuring
with
your
marked
pole
you
can
drive
the
four
pins
for
the
corner
guys
in
their
proper
places
next
spread
the
tent
on
the
ground
and
put
the
ridgepole
in
its
place
in
the
top
of
the
tent
and
the
two
upright
poles
in
their
places
then
raise
the
tent
it
will
take
two
persons
or
if
the
tent
is
large
four
or
more
having
first
moved
it
bodily
to
bring
the
feet
of
the
upright
poles
to
touch
the
two
small
pins
that
you
drove
at
the
beginning
you
can
now
catch
and
tighten
the
corner
on
the
four
pins
previously
driven
in
driving
the
other
pins
it
looks
well
to
have
them
on
a
line
if
possible
also
try
to
have
the
wall
of
the
tent
set
square
to
do
this
you
must
tie
the
door
just
right
before
you
tighten
a
you
will
find
this
way
of
pitching
a
tent
convenient
when
a
wind
is
blowing
or
when
your
assistant
is
not
a
strong
person
if
the
wind
is
very
high
spread
your
tent
to
windward
and
catch
the
windward
before
raising
the
tent
you
will
thus
avoid
having
it
blown
over
as
are
not
expensive
you
may
find
it
convenient
to
have
two
sets
for
each
tent
one
stout
set
for
common
use
and
a
lighter
set
to
take
when
transportation
is
limited
sound
spruce
free
from
large
knots
and
tolerably
makes
good
poles
pine
answers
as
well
but
is
more
expensive
the
upright
poles
of
a
stout
set
for
a
of
the
united
states
army
pattern
should
be
round
or
and
about
two
inches
in
diameter
if
you
prefer
to
have
them
square
round
off
the
edges
or
they
will
be
badly
bruised
upon
handling
drive
a
stout
iron
pin
seven
or
eight
inches
long
into
the
centre
of
the
top
until
it
projects
only
about
three
and
a
half
or
four
inches
or
enough
to
go
through
the
ridgepole
and
an
inch
beyond
it
will
be
necessary
to
bore
a
hole
in
the
pole
before
driving
in
the
pin
to
prevent
splitting
a
ferrule
is
also
serviceable
on
this
end
of
the
pole
the
ridgepole
should
be
well
rounded
on
the
edges
and
be
about
two
and
a
half
inches
wide
and
two
inches
thick
if
made
of
stuff
thinner
than
an
inch
and
a
half
it
should
be
wider
in
the
middle
than
above
stated
or
the
pole
will
sag
bore
the
holes
to
receive
the
pins
of
the
uprights
with
an
auger
a
size
larger
than
the
pins
so
that
they
may
go
in
and
out
easily
these
holes
should
be
an
inch
and
a
half
from
the
ends
ferrules
or
broad
bands
are
desirable
on
the
ends
of
the
ridgepole
but
if
you
can
not
afford
these
you
may
perhaps
be
able
to
put
a
rivet
or
two
through
the
pole
between
the
ends
and
the
holes
or
if
not
rivets
then
screws
which
are
better
than
nothing
to
prevent
the
pin
of
the
upright
from
splitting
the
ridgepole
should
be
made
of
sound
hard
wood
old
are
excellent
make
them
pointed
at
the
bottom
so
that
they
will
drive
easily
and
notch
them
about
two
inches
from
the
top
so
that
they
will
hold
the
rope
cut
away
the
wood
from
just
above
the
notch
towards
the
back
of
the
head
this
will
prevent
the
notch
of
the
pin
from
splitting
off
when
it
is
driven
it
is
well
to
have
pins
differ
in
length
and
size
those
for
the
corners
and
the
stays
should
be
the
largest
say
fifteen
to
eighteen
inches
long
and
those
for
the
wall
and
door
may
be
eight
or
ten
inches
but
pins
of
these
sizes
are
apt
to
pull
out
in
a
heavy
storm
and
so
when
you
are
to
camp
in
one
spot
for
some
time
or
when
you
see
a
storm
brewing
it
is
well
to
make
pins
very
stout
and
two
feet
or
more
long
for
the
stays
and
four
corner
out
of
such
stuff
as
you
find
at
hand
illustration
loosen
the
pins
by
striking
them
on
all
four
sides
before
you
try
to
pull
them
up
a
spade
is
a
fine
thing
to
use
to
pry
out
a
pin
that
is
deep
in
the
ground
and
a
wooden
mallet
is
better
than
an
axe
or
hatchet
to
drive
them
in
with
but
unless
you
have
a
large
number
of
pins
to
drive
it
will
hardly
pay
you
to
get
a
mallet
especially
for
this
business
make
a
stout
canvas
bag
to
hold
the
and
do
not
fold
them
loose
with
the
tent
as
it
soils
and
wears
out
the
cloth
best
size
of
tents
the
majority
of
people
who
go
into
permanent
camp
prefer
tents
considerably
larger
than
the
army
but
unless
your
camp
is
well
sheltered
from
the
wind
you
will
have
constant
and
serious
troubles
during
every
gale
and
if
you
are
in
a
large
or
high
tent
a
large
tent
is
certainly
more
comfortable
in
fine
weather
but
you
can
make
a
small
one
sufficiently
cheerful
and
have
a
sense
of
security
in
it
that
you
can
not
feel
in
one
larger
but
if
you
will
have
a
large
tent
make
it
of
something
heavier
than
drilling
if
you
have
two
tents
of
the
same
height
you
can
connect
the
tops
with
a
pole
and
throw
a
fly
blanket
or
sheet
over
it
on
pleasant
days
do
not
pack
away
a
tent
when
it
is
damp
if
you
can
possibly
avoid
it
as
it
will
mildew
and
decay
in
a
few
days
of
warm
weather
if
you
are
compelled
to
pack
it
when
very
damp
you
can
prevent
decay
by
salting
it
liberally
inside
and
out
before
you
put
away
your
tent
for
the
season
be
sure
that
it
is
perfectly
dry
and
that
the
dead
flies
and
grasshoppers
are
swept
out
of
the
inside
you
should
have
a
stout
bag
to
keep
it
in
and
to
prevent
its
being
chafed
and
soiled
when
it
is
handled
and
carried
you
will
find
a
hundred
good
uses
for
the
bag
in
camp
footnotes
you
can
not
find
this
sort
of
duck
in
the
market
now
but
heavy
drilling
inches
wide
is
nearly
as
strong
and
will
make
a
good
tent
tents
made
of
heavy
drilling
were
also
furnished
to
the
troops
the
dimensions
of
which
varied
a
trifle
from
those
here
given
they
had
the
disadvantage
of
two
seams
instead
of
one
if
the
party
is
of
four
or
even
five
a
made
of
three
breadths
of
heavy
drilling
will
accommodate
all
one
to
each
since
sewing
is
better
than
buttoning
and
the
last
is
not
necessary
when
your
party
will
always
camp
together
along
the
loose
border
of
the

the
corresponding
buttons
upon

more

at
the
corners
and
seams
as
in
the
army
shelter
and
also
on
the
middle
of
the
bottom
of
the

put
loops
of
small
rope
or
a
foot
or
two
of
stout
cord
through
all
of
these
facings
for
the
you
will
then
have
a
tent
with
the
least
amount
of
labor
and
material
in
it
the
top
edges
like
those
of
the
army
shelter
are
to
have
buttons
and
the
tent
can
then
be
taken
apart
into
two
pieces
each
of
which
will
weigh
about
two
pounds
and
a
quarter
nearly
all
of
the
work
can
be
done
on
a
run
two
rows
of
stitching
at
each
seam

near
the

you
can

the
width
of

be
explained
what
is

by
shoemakers
as

good
for
this
purpose
or
you
can
double
together
and
sew

chapter
x
general
advice
if
you
travel
horseback
singly
or
in
parties
a
previous
experience
in
riding
and
in
the
care
of
your
animal
are
necessary
for
pleasure
what
is
said
about
overloading
applies
here
you
must
go
light
let
your
saddlebags
be
small
and
packed
so
as
not
to
chafe
the
horse
if
you
have
the
choice
of
a
saddle
take
a
mcclellan
or
a
similar
one
so
that
you
can
easily
strap
on
your
blankets
and
bags
if
you
have
time
before
starting
try
to
teach
your
horse
what
so
few
horses
in
the
northern
states
know
to
be
guided
by
the
pressure
of
reins
against
the
neck
instead
of
a
pull
at
the
bit
boating
i
do
not
propose
to
say
much
about
boating
as
the
subject
can
hardly
have
justice
done
to
it
in
a
book
of
this
sort
parties
of
young
men
spend
their
summer
vacation
every
year
in
camping
and
boating
it
is
a
most
delightful
way
superior
in
many
respects
to
any
other
but
it
requires
both
experience
and
caution
neither
of
which
is
usually
found
in
young
men
so
i
hope
that
if
you
will
go
in
a
boat
you
may
be
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
and
will
for
your
parents
and
sake
take
a
small
boat
without
ballast
rather
than
a
large
one
ballasted
so
heavily
that
it
will
sink
when
it
fills
when
you
belay
the
sheets
of
your
sail
make
a
knot
that
can
be
untied
by
a
single
pull
at
the
loose
end
any
boatman
will
show
you
how
to
do
this
make
fast
the
sheets
in
any
other
hold
the
sheets
in
your
hands
if
the
wind
is
at
all
squally
or
strong
do
not
venture
out
in
a
heavy
wind
stow
your
baggage
snugly
before
you
start
tubs
made
by
sawing
a
in
two
are
excellent
to
throw
loose
stuff
into
remember
to
be
careful
keep
your
eyes
open
and
know
what
you
are
going
to
do
before
you
try
it
the
saying
of
an
old
comes
to
me
here
i
would
rather
sail
a
ship
around
the
world
than
to
go
down
the
bay
in
a
boat
sailed
by
a
boy
reckoning
lost
it
often
happens
in
travelling
that
the
sun
rises
in
what
appears
the
north
west
or
south
and
we
seem
to
be
moving
in
the
wrong
direction
so
that
when
we
return
home
our
remembrance
of
the
journey
is
confused
perhaps
a
few
hints
on
this
subject
may
help
the
reader
supposing
your
day
journey
ends
at
blanktown
where
you
find
your
apparently
reversed
it
then
becomes
natural
for
you
to
make
matters
worse
by
trying
to
lay
out
in
your
mind
a
new
map
with
blanktown
for
the
hub
and
east
in
the
west
and
so
on
you
can
often
prevent
these
mishaps
and
can
always
make
them
less
annoying
by
studying
your
map
well
both
before
and
during
your
journey
and
by
keeping
in
your
mind
continually
with
all
the
vividness
you
can
what
you
are
really
doing
as
far
as
blanktown
is
concerned
you
will
have
two
impressions
just
as
we
all
have
two
impressions
with
regard
to
the
revolution
of
the
earth
on
its
axis
apparently
the
sun
rises
goes
over
and
down
but
in
our
minds
we
can
see
the
sun
standing
still
and
the
earth
turning
from
west
to
east
upon
leaving
blanktown
you
are
likely
to
carry
the
error
along
with
you
and
to
find
yourself
moving
in
what
appears
to
be
the
wrong
way
keep
in
mind
with
all
the
vividness
possible
the
picture
of
what
you
are
really
doing
and
keep
out
of
mind
as
much
as
you
can
the
ugly
appearance
of
going
the
wrong
way
every
important
change
you
make
be
sure
to
see
it
in
the
mind
eye
and
let
the
natural
eye
be
blind
to
all
that
is
deceiving
after
a
while
things
will
grow
real
and
you
must
try
to
keep
them
so
the
more
perfectly
you
know
the
route
and
all
its
details
the
less
you
will
be
troubled
in
this
way
if
you
are
travelling
in
the
cars
and
if
you
have
a
strong
power
of
imagination
you
can
very
easily
right
errors
of
this
kind
by
learning
from
the
map
exactly
what
you
are
doing
and
then
by
sitting
next
to
the
window
shut
your
eyes
as
you
go
around
a
curve
that
tends
to
aggravate
the
difficulty
and
hold
fast
what
you
get
on
curves
that
help
you
if
you
sit
on
the
left
side
of
the
car
and
look
ahead
the
cars
seem
to
sweep
continually
a
little
to
the
right
and
when
really
moving
straight
ahead
provided
your
imagination
is
good
when
you
are
travelling
on
an
unknown
road
you
should
always
inquire
all
about
it
to
avoid
taking
the
wrong
one
which
you
are
likely
to
do
even
if
you
have
a
good
map
with
you
ladies
as
pedestrians
i
have
once
or
twice
alluded
to
ladies
walking
and
camping
it
is
thoroughly
practicable
for
them
to
do
so
they
must
have
a
wagon
and
do
none
of
the
heavy
work
their
gowns
must
not
reach
quite
to
the
ground
and
all
of
their
clothing
must
be
loose
and
easy
of
course
there
must
be
gentlemen
in
the
party
and
it
may
save
annoyance
to
have
at
least
one
of
the
ladies
ladies
must
be
cared
for
more
tenderly
than
men
if
they
are
not
well
the
wagon
should
go
back
for
them
at
the
end
of
the
day
march
are
not
to
be
recommended
for
them
nor
are
two
blankets
sufficient
bedclothing
they
ought
not
to
be
compelled
to
go
any
definite
distance
but
after
having
made
their
day
walk
let
the
tents
be
pitched
rainy
weather
is
particularly
unpleasant
to
ladies
in
tents
deserted
houses
schoolhouses
or
barns
should
be
sought
for
them
when
a
storm
is
brewing
ladies
and
children
in
camp
in
a
permanent
camp
however
ladies
and
children
as
well
can
make
themselves
thoroughly
at
home
they
ought
not
to
rough
it
so
much
as
young
men
expect
to
consequently
they
should
be
better
protected
from
the
wet
and
cold
i
have
seen
a
man
with
his
wife
and
two
children
enjoy
themselves
through
a
week
of
rainy
weather
in
an
but
there
are
not
many
such
happy
families
and
it
is
not
advisable
to
camp
with
such
limited
accommodations
almost
all
women
will
find
it
trying
to
their
backs
to
be
kept
all
day
in
an
if
you
have
no
other
kind
you
should
build
some
sort
of
a
wall
and
pitch
the
tent
on
top
of
it
it
is
not
a
difficult
or
expensive
task
to
put
and
a
wall
of
drilling
on
an
and
make
new
poles
or
pitch
the
old
ones
upon
posts
in
either
case
you
should
stay
the
tent
with
lines
running
from
the
top
to
the
ground
it
has
already
been
advised
that
women
should
have
a
stove
in
general
they
ought
not
to
depart
so
far
from
home
ways
as
men
do
rubber
boots
are
almost
a
necessity
for
women
and
children
during
rainy
weather
and
while
the
dew
is
upon
the
grass
sheds
and
brush
screens
there
is
little
to
be
said
of
the
built
at
the
seaside
near
our
large
cities
since
that
is
rather
a
matter
of
carpentry
nor
of
portable
houses
nor
of
with
painted
paper
nor
even
of
a
schbang
such
as
i
have
often
built
of
old
doors
shutters
outer
windows
and
tarred
paper
any
one
who
is
ingenious
can
knock
together
all
the
shelter
his
needs
require
or
means
allow
but
where
you
are
camping
for
a
week
or
more
it
pays
you
well
to
use
all
you
have
in
making
yourself
comfortable
a
bush
house
a
canopy
under
which
to
eat
and
something
better
than
plain
to
cook
in
are
among
the
first
things
to
attend
to
if
you
wish
to
plant
firmly
a
tree
that
you
have
cut
down
you
may
perhaps
be
able
to
drive
a
stake
larger
than
the
trunk
of
the
tree
then
loosen
the
stake
by
hitting
it
on
the
sides
and
pull
it
out
you
can
do
this
when
you
have
no
shovel
or
when
the
soil
is
too
hard
to
dig
small
stakes
wedged
down
the
hole
after
putting
in
the
tree
will
make
it
firm
etiquette
some
things
considered
essential
at
the
home
table
have
fallen
into
disuse
in
camp
it
is
pardonable
and
perhaps
best
to
bring
on
whatever
you
have
cooked
in
the
dish
that
it
is
cooked
in
so
as
to
prevent
its
cooling
off
you
will
also
be
allowed
to
help
yourself
first
to
whatever
is
nearest
you
before
passing
it
to
another
for
passing
things
around
in
camp
is
risky
and
should
be
avoided
as
much
as
possible
for
that
reason
eat
with
your
hats
on
as
it
is
more
comfortable
and
the
wind
is
not
so
apt
to
blow
your
stray
hairs
into
the
next
man
dish
if
you
have
no
fork
do
not
mind
eating
with
your
knife
and
fingers
but
however
much
liberty
you
take
do
not
be
rude
coarse
or
uncivil
these
bad
habits
grow
rapidly
in
camp
if
you
encourage
them
and
are
broken
off
with
difficulty
on
return
if
there
is
no
separate
knife
for
the
butter
cheese
and
meat
nor
spoon
for
the
gravy
and
soup
you
can
use
your
own
by
first
wiping
the
knife
or
spoon
upon
a
piece
of
bread
be
social
and
agreeable
to
all
you
meet
it
is
a
received
rule
now
i
believe
that
you
are
under
no
obligations
to
consider
as
permanent
so
you
are
in
duty
bound
to
be
friendly
to
all
thrown
in
your
way
however
it
is
not
fair
to
thrust
your
company
upon
others
nor
compel
a
courtesy
from
any
one
try
to
remember
too
that
it
is
nothing
wonderful
to
camp
out
or
walk
and
do
not
expect
any
one
to
think
it
is
we
frequently
meet
parties
of
young
folks
walking
through
the
mountains
who
do
great
things
with
their
tongues
but
not
much
with
their
feet
if
you
will
refrain
from
bragging
you
can
speak
of
your
short
marches
without
exciting
contempt
avoid
as
much
as
possible
asking
another
member
of
the
party
to
do
your
work
or
to
wait
upon
you
it
is
surprising
how
easily
you
can
make
yourself
disliked
by
asking
a
few
trifling
favors
of
one
who
is
tired
and
hungry
mosquitoes
black
flies
and
midge
these
pests
will
annoy
you
exceedingly
almost
everywhere
in
the
summer
in
the
daytime
motion
and
perspiration
keep
them
off
to
some
extent
at
night
or
when
lying
down
you
can
do
no
better
than
to
cover
yourself
so
that
they
can
not
reach
your
body
and
have
a
of
some
sort
over
your
head
the
simplest
thing
is
a
square
yard
of
thrown
over
the
head
and
tucked
in
well
you
will
need
to
have
your
hat
first
thrown
over
the
head
and
your
turned
up
to
prevent
the
mosquitoes
reaching
through
the
mesh
to
your
face
and
neck
a
better
way
than
this
is
to
make
a
large
enough
to
stretch
across
the
head
of
the
bed
and
cover
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
all
that
sleep
in
the
tent
it
should
be
six
or
eight
feet
long
twenty
to
inches
wide
and
one
yard
or
more
high
it
will
be
more
durable
but
not
quite
so
well
ventilated
if
the
top
is
made
of
light
cloth
instead
of
netting
the
seams
should
be
bound
with
stout
tape
and
the
sides
and
ends
gathered
considerably
in
sewing
them
to
the
top
even
then
the
side
that
falls
over
the
shoulders
of
the
sleepers
may
not
be
loose
enough
to
fill
the
hollows
between
them
the
netting
will
then
have
to
be
tucked
under
the
blanket
or
have
something
thrown
over
its
lower
edge
sew
loops
or
strings
on
the
four
upper
corners
and
corresponding
loops
or
strings
on
the
tent
so
that
you
can
tie
up
the
bar
bobbinet
lace
is
better
than
the
common
netting
for
all
of
these
purposes
it
comes
in
pieces
twelve
to
fourteen
yards
long
and
two
yards
wide
you
can
not
often
find
it
for
sale
but
the
large
shops
in
the
principal
cities
that
do
a
great
business
by
correspondence
can
send
it
to
you
oil
of
cedar
and
oil
of
pennyroyal
are
recommended
as
serviceable
in
driving
off
mosquitoes
and
there
are
patented
compounds
whose
labels
pretend
great
things
you
will
try
them
only
once
i
think
ammoniated
opodeldoc
rubbed
upon
the
bites
will
in
a
great
measure
stop
the
itching
and
hasten
the
cure
they
say
that
a
little
gunpowder
flashed
in
the
tent
will
drive
out
flies
and
mosquitoes
i
saw
a
man
try
it
once
but
noticed
that
he
himself
went
out
in
a
great
hurry
while
the
flies
if
they
went
at
all
were
back
again
before
he
was
a
better
thing
really
the
best
is
a
smudge
made
by
building
a
small
fire
to
the
windward
of
your
tent
and
nearly
smothering
it
with
chips
moss
bark
or
rotten
wood
if
you
make
the
smudge
in
an
old
pan
or
pot
you
can
move
it
about
as
often
as
the
wind
changes
how
to
skin
fish
when
you
camp
by
the
seaside
you
will
catch
cunners
and
other
fish
that
need
skinning
let
no
one
persuade
you
to
slash
the
back
fins
out
with
a
single
stroke
as
you
would
whittle
a
stick
but
take
a
sharp
knife
cut
on
both
sides
of
the
fin
and
then
pull
out
the
whole
of
it
from
head
to
tail
and
thus
save
the
trouble
that
a
hundred
little
bones
will
make
if
left
in
after
cutting
the
skin
on
the
under
side
from
head
to
tail
and
taking
out
the
entrails
and
small
fins
start
the
skin
where
the
head
joins
the
body
and
pull
it
off
one
side
at
a
time
some
men
stick
an
awl
through
a
cunner
head
or
catch
it
fast
in
a
stout
iron
hook
to
hold
it
while
skinning
cunners
and
lobsters
are
sometimes
caught
off
bold
rocks
in
a
net
you
can
make
one
easily
out
of
a
and
twine
stretched
across
so
as
to
make
a
mesh
tie
a
lot
of
bait
securely
in
the
middle
sink
it
for
a
few
minutes
and
draw
up
rapidly
the
rush
of
water
through
the
net
prevents
the
fish
from
escaping
expenses
the
expenses
of
camping
or
walking
vary
greatly
of
course
according
to
the
route
manner
of
going
and
other
things
the
principal
items
are
horse
and
wagon
hire
trucking
if
you
camp
where
rent
is
charged
and
the
cost
of
the
outfit
you
ought
to
be
able
to
reckon
very
nearly
what
you
will
have
to
pay
on
account
of
these
before
you
spend
a
cent
after
this
will
come
the
calculation
whether
to
travel
at
all
by
rail
supposing
you
wish
to
go
a
hundred
miles
to
reach
the
seaside
where
you
propose
to
camp
or
the
mountains
you
want
to
climb
if
you
have
a
horse
and
wagon
or
are
going
horseback
it
will
doubtless
be
cheaper
to
march
than
to
ride
and
pay
freight
if
time
is
plenty
and
money
is
scarce
you
may
perhaps
be
able
to
walk
the
distance
cheaper
than
to
go
by
rail
but
if
you
lodge
at
hotels
you
will
find
it
considerably
more
expensive
the
question
then
is
apt
to
turn
on
whether
the
hundred
miles
is
worth
seeing
and
whether
it
is
so
thickly
settled
as
to
prevent
your
camping
to
walk
a
hundred
miles
carrying
your
kit
all
the
way
will
take
from
one
to
two
weeks
according
to
your
age
strength
and
the
weather
we
have
already
stated
that
there
is
little
in
walking
more
than
sixty
miles
a
week
but
if
you
wish
to
go
as
fast
as
you
can
and
have
taken
pains
to
practise
walking
before
starting
and
can
buy
your
food
in
small
quantities
daily
and
can
otherwise
reduce
your
baggage
you
can
make
the
hundred
miles
in
a
week
without
difficulty
and
more
if
it
is
necessary
unless
there
is
much
bad
weather
the
expense
for
food
will
also
vary
according
to
one
will
but
it
need
not
be
heavy
if
you
can
content
yourself
with
simple
fare
you
can
hardly
live
at
a
cheaper
rate
than
the
following
one
week
supply
for
two
men
ten
pounds
of
eight
pounds
of
salt
pork
one
pound
of
coffee
roasted
and
ground
one
to
two
pounds
of
sugar
granulated
thirty
pounds
of
potatoes
half
a
bushel
a
little
beef
and
butter
and
a
few
will
be
good
investments
supposing
you
and
i
were
to
start
from
home
in
the
morning
after
breakfast
when
noon
comes
we
eat
the
lunch
we
have
taken
with
us
and
press
on
as
the
end
of
the
day
march
approaches
we
look
out
to
buy
two
quarts
of
potatoes
at
a
farmhouse
or
store
and
we
boil
or
fry
or
boil
and
mash
in
milk
enough
of
these
for
our
supper
the
breakfast
next
morning
is
much
the
same
we
cook
potatoes
in
every
way
we
know
and
eat
the
whole
of
our
stock
remaining
thus
saving
so
much
weight
to
carry
we
also
soak
some
and
fry
that
for
a
dessert
eating
a
little
sugar
on
it
if
we
can
spare
it
when
approaches
we
keep
a
lookout
for
a
chance
to
buy
ten
or
twelve
cents
worth
of
bread
or
biscuits
these
are
more
palatable
than
the
or
crackers
in
our
haversack
if
we
have
a
potato
left
from
breakfast
we
cook
and
eat
it
now
we
cut
off
a
slice
of
the
corned
beef
and
take
a
nibble
at
the
if
we
think
we
can
afford
three
or
four
cents
more
we
buy
a
pint
of
milk
and
make
a
little
and
so
we
go
sometimes
we
catch
a
fish
or
pass
an
orchard
whose
owner
gives
us
all
the
windfalls
we
want
we
pick
berries
too
and
keep
a
sharp
lookout
that
we
supply
ourselves
in
season
when
our
sugar
pork
and
butter
run
low
some
days
we
overtake
farmers
driving
or
wagons
we
throw
our
kits
aboard
and
walk
slowly
along
willing
to
lose
a
little
time
to
save
our
aching
shoulders
and
in
due
time
if
no
accident
befalls
nor
rainy
weather
detains
us
we
arrive
at
our
seashore
or
mountain
you
may
like
to
know
that
this
is
almost
an
exact
history
at
least
as
far
as
eating
is
concerned
of
a
twelve
days
tramp
i
once
went
on
in
company
with
two
other
boys
there
was
about
five
dollars
in
the
party
and
nearly
two
dollars
of
this
was
spent
in
paying
toll
on
a
boat
that
we
took
through
a
canal
a
part
of
the
way
we
carried
coffee
sugar
pork
and
beef
from
home
and
ate
potatoes
three
times
a
day
we
had
a
delightful
time
and
came
home
fattened
up
somewhat
but
i
will
admit
that
i
did
not
call
for
potatoes
when
i
got
back
to
my
father
table
for
some
days
in
general
however
it
will
be
noticed
that
those
who
camp
out
for
the
season
or
go
on
do
so
at
a
moderate
expense
because
they
start
with
the
determination
to
make
it
cheap
for
this
purpose
they
content
themselves
with
old
clothes
which
they
fit
over
or
repair
take
from
their
own
kitchen
and
excepting
in
the
matter
of
canned
foods
do
not
live
very
differently
from
what
they
do
at
home
nearly
all
the
parties
of
boys
that
i
have
questioned
spend
all
the
money
they
have
be
it
little
or
much
generally
those
i
have
met
walking
or
camping
seem
to
be
impressed
with
the
magnitude
of
their
operations
and
to
be
carrying
constantly
with
them
the
determination
to
spend
their
funds
sparingly
enough
to
reach
home
without
begging
it
is
not
bad
practice
for
a
young
man
here
i
wish
to
say
a
word
to
parents
having
been
a
boy
myself
and
being
now
a
father
let
your
boys
go
when
summer
comes
put
them
to
their
wits
do
not
let
them
be
extravagant
nor
have
money
to
pay
other
men
for
working
for
them
it
is
far
better
for
them
to
move
about
than
to
remain
in
one
place
all
the
time
the
last
especially
if
the
camp
is
near
some
place
of
public
resort
tends
to
encourage
idleness
and
dissipation
when
you
return
home
again
from
a
tour
of
camping
and
go
back
to
a
sedentary
life
remember
that
you
do
not
need
to
eat
all
that
your
appetite
calls
for
you
may
make
yourself
sick
if
you
go
on
eating
such
meals
as
you
have
been
digesting
in
camp
you
are
apt
also
upon
your
return
to
feel
as
you
did
on
the
first
and
second
days
of
your
tour
this
is
especially
liable
to
be
the
case
if
you
have
overworked
yourself
or
have
not
had
enough
sleep

by
all
means
keep
a

the
act

will
help
you
to
remember
these
good
times

the
diary
will
prove
the
pleasantest
of
reading
in
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
write
in

if
it

you
will
prize
it
all
the

i
beg
you
to
persevere
and
if
you

i
can
not

the
desire
to
tell
you
the
results
of
my

long

they
are

better

write
a
pocket
diary
with
lead
pencil
do
that
second
all
such
small
diaries
scraps
letters
and
every
thing
written
illegibly
or
with
lead
pencil
are
difficult
to
preserve
or
to
read
and
are
very
unhandy
for
reference
third
it
is
great
folly
to
persuade
yourself
that
after
taking
notes
for
a
week
or
two
or
writing
a
hurried
sketch
you
can
extend
or
copy
and
illuminate
at
your
leisure
consequently
write
what
you
can
and
let
it
stand
with
all
its
blots
errors
and
nonsense
and
be
careful
when
you
are
five
years
older
not
to
go
through
the
diary
with
eraser
and
scissors
for
if
you
live
still
another
five
years
nothing
will
interest
you
more
than
this
diary
with
all
its
defects
i
find
after
having
written
many
diaries
of
many
forms
that
i
have
now
to
regret
i
did
not
at
first
choose
some
particular
size
say
and
so
have
had
all
my
diaries
uniform
i
will
never
again
use
which
is
too
thin
nor
any
figured
cheap
or
colored
paper
i
do
not
like
those
large
printed
diaries
which
give
you
just
a
page
or
a
day
nor
a
paper
whose
ruling
shows
conspicuously
i
like
best
when
at
home
to
write
in
a
blank
book
and
when
i
go
off
on
a
summer
vacation
i
leave
that
diary
safely
at
home
and
take
a
portfolio
with
some
sheets
of
blank
paper
upon
which
to
write
the
diary
and
mail
them
as
fast
as
written
these
answer
for
letters
to
the
friends
at
home
and
save
writing
any
more
to
them
they
also
when
bound
form
a
diary
exclusively
of
travels
when
i
return
i
write
an
epitome
in
the
and
thus
prevent
a
break
of
dates
in
that
book
the
paper
for
the
diary
of
travels
is
strong
but
rather
thin
and
white
i
buy
enough
of
it
at
once
to
make
a
volume
and
thus
have
the
diary
sheets
uniform
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
will
do
well
to
write
a
diary
of
your
summer
vacation
upon
the
plan
just
named
whether
you
keep
one
at
home
or
not
try
to
do
it
well
but
do
not
undertake
too
much
write
facts
such
as
what
you
saw
heard
did
and
failed
to
do
but
do
not
try
to
write
poetry
or
fine
writing
of
any
kind
mention
what
kind
of
weather
but
do
not
attempt
a
meteorological
record
unless
you
have
a
special
liking
for
that
science
if
you
camp
in
jacob
sawyer
pasture
and
he
gives
you
a
quart
of
milk
say
so
instead
of
a
good
old
man
showed
us
a
favor
for
in
the
memory
of
it
will
be
sweeter
than
the
milk
was
and
it
will
puzzle
you
to
recall
the
good
old
man
name
and
what
the
favor
was
if
you
have
time
try
to
draw
never
mind
if
it
is
a
poor
picture
i
have
some
of
the
portraits
and
most
surprising
perspectives
in
my
diaries
written
when
fifteen
to
twenty
years
old
but
i
would
not
exchange
them
now
for
one
of
the
old
masters
do
not
neglect
the
narrative
however
for
sake
of
drawing
i
have
noticed
that
when
my
paper
is
down
in
the
bottom
of
a
valise
and
the
pen
in
a
wallet
and
the
penholder
in
a
and
portfolio
somewhere
else
it
is
not
so
easy
to
find
time
to
write
as
when
i
have
penholder
pen
and
paper
in
the
portfolio
and
the
portfolio
and
ink
in
my
haversack
under
these
favorable
conditions
it
is
easy
to
snatch
a
few
moments
from
any
halt
and
a
diary
written
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
is
a
diary
that
will
be
worth
reading
in
if
it
is
impossible
however
as
it
so
often
is
to
write
oftener
than
once
a
day
you
will
do
well
to
make
a
note
of
events
as
fast
as
they
happen
so
that
you
shall
not
forget
them
nor
have
to
stop
to
recall
them
when
your
time
is
precious
i
have
heard
of
diaries
with
on
each
page
and
even
an
index
at
the
end
of
the
book
but
not
many
men
and
but
few
boys
can
do
all
this
and
my
advice
to
the
average
boy
is
not
to
undertake
it
nor
any
thing
else
that
will
use
the
time
patience
and
perseverance
needed
to
write
the
narrative
you
will
find
it
convenient
for
reference
if
you
make
a
paragraph
of
every
subject
date
every
day
distinctly
with
a
much
bolder
handwriting
than
the
body
of
the
diary
and
write
the
date
on
the
right
margin
of
the
right
page
and
left
margin
of
the
left
page
with
the
year
at
the
top
of
the
page
only
skip
a
line
or
two
instead
of
ruling
between
the
days
thus
and
ends
harding
is
full
of
going
on
a

smith
to

this
evening
and
went

to
avoid

not

bad

and
pleasant

went

if
you
are
like
me
you
will
be
glad
by
and
by
if
you
note
in
your
diary
of
the
summer
vacation
a
few
dry
statistics
such
as

chapter
xii
how
to
do
it
the
following
advice
by
rev
edward
everett
hale
is
so
good
that
i
have
appropriated
it
you
will
find
more
good
advice
in
the
same
book
first
never
walk
before
breakfast
if
you
like
you
may
make
two
breakfasts
and
take
a
mile
or
two
between
but
be
sure
to
eat
something
before
you
are
on
the
road
second
do
not
walk
much
in
the
middle
of
the
day
it
is
dusty
and
hot
then
and
the
landscape
has
lost
its
special
glory
by
ten
you
ought
to
have
found
some
for
the
day
a
nice
brook
running
through
a
grove
a
place
to
draw
or
paint
or
tell
stories
or
read
them
or
write
them
a
place
to
make
waterfalls
and
dams
to
sail
chips
or
build
boats
a
place
to
make
a
fire
and
a
cup
of
tea
for
the
oldsters
stay
here
till
four
in
the
afternoon
and
then
push
on
in
the
two
or
three
hours
which
are
left
to
the
agreed
upon
four
or
five
hours
on
the
road
is
all
you
want
in
each
day
even
resolute
idlers
as
it
is
to
be
hoped
you
all
are
on
such
occasions
can
get
eight
miles
a
day
out
of
that
and
that
is
enough
for
a
true
remember
all
along
that
you
are
not
running
a
race
with
the
if
you
were
you
would
be
beaten
certainly
and
the
less
you
think
you
are
the
better
you
are
travelling
in
a
method
of
which
the
merit
is
that
it
is
not
fast
and
that
you
see
every
separate
detail
of
the
glory
of
the
world
what
a
fool
you
are
then
if
you
tire
yourself
to
death
merely
that
you
may
say
that
you
did
in
ten
hours
what
the
locomotive
would
gladly
have
finished
in
one
if
by
that
effort
you
have
lost
exactly
the
enjoyment
of
nature
and
society
that
you
started
for
the
advice
to
rest
in
the
heat
of
the
day
is
good
for
very
hot
weather
young
people
however
are
too
impatient
to
follow
it
unless
there
is
an
apparent
necessity
the
feeling
at
twelve
that
you
have
yet
to
walk
as
far
as
you
have
come
is
not
so
pleasant
as
that
of
knowing
you
have
all
the
afternoon
for
rest
for
this
reason
nearly
every
one
will
finish
the
walk
as
soon
as
possible
still
hale
plan
is
a
good
one
the
best
for
very
hot
weather
still
another
way
to
travel
hale
also
tells
an
amusing
story
of
his
desire
when
young
to
sail
down
the
connecticut
river
but
he
was
dissuaded
from
doing
so
when
the
chance
finally
came
by
people
who
thought
the
road
was
the
only
place
to
travel
in
and
now
he
is
sorry
he
did
not
sail
the
reading
of
his
story
brings
to
mind
a
similar
experience
that
i
had
when
young
and
it
is
now
one
of
the
keen
regrets
of
my
manhood
that
i
likewise
was
laughed
out
of
a
boyish
plan
that
would
have
given
me
untold
pleasure
and
profit
had
it
been
carried
out
i
loved
to
walk
and
i
wanted
to
see
the
towns
within
a
circuit
of
twenty
or
thirty
miles
of
home
but
i
could
not
afford
to
pay
and
i
was
not
strong
enough
to
carry
a
but
i
had
an
old
cart
strong
and
large
enough
to
hold
all
i
should
need
i
could
load
it
with
the
same
food
that
i
should
eat
if
i
staid
at
home
could
wear
my
old
clothes
take
my
oilcloth
overcoat
an
axe
pail
and
a
borrowed
tent
and
poles
and
i
would
learn
the
county
by
heart
before
vacation
was
over
and
not
cost
my
father
a
cent
more
than
if
i
staid
at
home
oh
why
did
i
go
simply
because
i
was
laughed
out
of
it
i
was
told
that
people
did
not
travel
in
that
way
i
should
be
arrested
the
boys
would
hoot
at
and
stone
me
the
men
would
set
their
dogs
on
me
i
should
be
driven
out
of
my
thieves
would
steal
my
cent
cart
dogs
would
eat
up
my
stock
of
food
and
the
first
man
who
overtook
me
would
tell
the
people
that
a
crazy
boy
from
portland
was
coming
along
the
road
dragging
a
whereupon
every
woman
would
leave
her
kitchen
and
every
man
his
field
to
see
and
laugh
at
me
but
above
all
the
thing
would
be
known
in
our
neighborhood
and
the
boys
and
girls
would
join
in
their
abuse
of
the
county
explorer
that
was
the
end
of
it
the
being
made
sport
of
by
own
and
hearing
the
boys
in
our
sing
out
how
your
cart
and
to
be
known
all
through
life
perhaps
as
the
punishment
would
be
too
severe
but
my
young
friends
i
made
a
great
mistake
and
i
want
to
caution
you
to
surrender
to
any
such
nonsense
as
i
did
if
you
wish
to
go
to
sea
in
a
skiff
it
is
well
to
give
in
to
a
fisherman
advice
to
stay
at
home
for
he
can
assure
you
that
winds
and
waves
will
be
the
death
of
you
but
if
you
have
a
good
and
are
willing
to
stand
a
few
taunts
by
all
means
go
on
your
walk
and
pull
your
wagon
after
you
you
will
learn
a
lesson
in
independence
that
will
be
of
value
to
you
if
you
learn
nothing
else

has
had
long
experience
with

in

field
and

is
an
enthusiastic
student

are
especially
recommended
to
the

they

out

place
whether

or
dense
undergrowth
taking
cold
this
vague
household
word
indicates
one
or
more
of
a
long
varied
train
of
unpleasant
affections
nearly
always
traceable
to
one
or
the
other
of
only
two
causes
of
temperature
and
of
temperature
no
extremes
of
heat
or
cold
can
alone
affect
this
result
persons
frozen
to
death
do
not
take
cold
during
the
process
but
if
a
part
of
the
body
be
rapidly
cooled
as
by
evaporation
from
a
wet
article
of
clothing
or
by
sitting
in
a
draught
of
air
the
rest
of
the
body
remaining
at
an
ordinary
temperature
or
if
the
temperature
of
the
whole
be
suddenly
changed
by
going
out
into
the
cold
or
especially
by
coming
into
a
warm
room
there
is
much
liability
of
trouble
there
is
an
old
saying
when
the
air
comes
through
a
hole
say
your
prayers
to
save
your
soul
and
i
should
think
almost
any
one
could
get
a
cold
with
a
spoonful
of
water
on
the
wrist
held
to
a
singular
as
it
may
seem
sudden
warming
when
cold
is
more
dangerous
than
the
reverse
every
one
has
noticed
how
soon
the
handkerchief
is
required
on
entering
a
heated
room
on
a
cold
day
is
an
extreme
illustration
of
this
as
the
irishman
said
on
picking
himself
up
it
was
not
the
fall
but
stopping
so
quickly
that
hurt
him
it
is
not
the
lowering
of
the
temperature
to
freezing
point
but
its
subsequent
elevation
that
devitalizes
the
tissue
this
is
why
rubbing
with
snow
or
bathing
in
cold
water
is
required
to
restore
safely
a
frozen
part
the
arrested
circulation
must
be
very
gradually
or
inflammation
perhaps
mortification
ensues
general
precautions
against
taking
cold
are
almost
in
this
light
there
is
ordinarily
little
if
any
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
wet
clothes
so
long
as
exercise
is
kept
up
for
the
glow
about
compensates
for
the
extra
cooling
by
evaporation
nor
is
a
complete
drenching
more
likely
to
be
injurious
than
wetting
of
one
part
but
never
sit
still
wet
and
in
changing
rub
the
body
dry
there
is
a
general
tendency
springing
from
fatigue
indolence
or
indifference
to
neglect
damp
feet
that
is
to
say
to
dry
them
by
the
fire
but
this
process
is
tedious
and
uncertain
i
would
say
especially
off
with
muddy
boots
and
sodden
socks
at
once
dry
stockings
and
slippers
after
a
hunt
may
make
just
the
difference
of
your
being
able
to
go
out
again
or
never
take
care
never
to
check
perspiration
during
this
process
the
body
is
in
a
somewhat
critical
condition
and
the
sudden
arrest
of
the
function
may
result
disastrously
even
fatally
one
part
of
the
business
of
perspiration
is
to
equalize
bodily
temperature
and
it
must
not
be
interfered
with
the
secret
of
much
that
is
said
about
when
heated
lies
here
a
person
overheated
panting
it
may
be
with
throbbing
temples
and
a
skin
is
in
danger
partly
because
the
natural
cooling
by
evaporation
from
the
skin
is
denied
and
this
condition
is
sometimes
not
far
from
a
sunstroke
under
these
circumstances
a
person
of
fairly
good
constitution
may
plunge
into
the
water
with
impunity
even
with
benefit
but
if
the
body
be
already
cooling
by
sweating
rapid
abstraction
of
heat
from
the
surface
may
cause
internal
congestion
never
unattended
with
danger
drinking
offers
a
somewhat
parallel
case
even
on
stopping
to
drink
at
the
brook
when
flushed
with
heat
it
is
well
to
bathe
the
face
and
hands
first
and
to
taste
the
water
before
a
full
draught
it
is
a
excellent
rule
not
to
bathe
immediately
after
a
full
meal
because
during
digestion
the
organs
concerned
are
comparatively
engorged
and
any
sudden
disturbance
of
the
circulation
may
be
disastrous
the
imperative
necessity
of
resisting
drowsiness
under
extreme
cold
requires
no
comment
in
walking
under
a
hot
sun
the
head
may
be
sensibly
protected
by
green
leaves
or
grass
in
the
hat
they
may
be
advantageously
moistened
but
not
enough
to
drip
about
the
ears
under
such
circumstances
the
slightest
giddiness
dimness
of
sight
or
confusion
of
ideas
should
be
taken
as
a
warning
of
possible
sunstroke
instantly
demanding
rest
and
shelter
if
practicable
hunger
and
fatigue
are
more
closely
related
than
they
might
seem
to
be
one
is
a
sign
that
the
fuel
is
out
and
the
other
asks
for
it
extreme
fatigue
indeed
destroys
appetite
this
simply
means
temporary
incapacity
for
digestion
but
even
far
short
of
this
food
is
more
easily
digested
and
better
relished
after
a
little
preparation
of
the
furnace
on
coming
home
tired
it
is
much
better
to
make
a
leisurely
and
reasonably
nice
toilet
than
to
eat
at
once
or
to
lie
still
thinking
how
tired
you
are
after
a
change
and
a
wash
you
feel
like
a
new
man
and
go
to
the
table
in
capital
state
whatever
dietetic
irregularities
a
high
state
of
civilization
may
demand
or
render
practicable
a
normally
healthy
person
is
inconvenienced
almost
as
soon
as
his
regular
mealtime
passes
without
food
and
few
can
work
comfortably
or
profitably
fasting
over
six
or
eight
hours
eat
before
starting
if
for
a
day
tramp
take
a
lunch
the
most
frugal
meal
will
appease
if
it
do
not
satisfy
hunger
and
so
postpone
its
urgency
as
a
small
scrap
of
practical
wisdom
i
would
add
keep
the
remnants
of
the
lunch
if
there
be
any
for
you
can
not
always
be
sure
of
getting
in
to
supper
stimulation
when
cold
fatigued
depressed
in
mind
and
on
other
occasions
you
may
feel
inclined
to
resort
to
artificial
stimulus
respecting
this
theme
i
have
a
few
words
to
offer
of
direct
bearing
on
the
collector
case
it
should
be
clearly
understood
in
the
first
place
that
a
stimulant
confers
no
strength
whatever
it
simply
calls
the
powers
that
be
into
increased
action
at
their
own
expense
seeking
real
strength
in
stimulus
is
as
wise
as
an
attempt
to
lift
yourself
up
by
your
you
may
gather
yourself
to
leap
the
ditch
and
you
clear
it
but
no
such
muscular
energy
can
be
sustained
exhaustion
speedily
renders
further
expenditure
impossible
but
now
suppose
a
very
powerful
mental
impression
be
made
say
the
circumstance
of
a
succession
of
ditches
in
front
and
a
mad
dog
behind
if
the
stimulus
of
terror
be
sufficiently
strong
you
may
leap
on
till
you
drop
senseless
alcoholic
stimulus
is
a
parallel
case
and
is
not
seldom
pushed
to
the
same
extreme
under
its
influence
you
never
can
tell
when
you
tired
the
expenditure
goes
on
indeed
with
unnatural
rapidity
only
it
is
not
felt
at
the
time
but
the
upshot
is
you
have
all
the
original
fatigue
to
endure
and
to
recover
from
the
fatigue
resulting
from
of
the
system
taken
as
a
fortification
against
cold
alcohol
is
as
unsatisfactory
as
a
remedy
for
fatigue
insensibility
to
cold
does
not
imply
protection
the
fact
is
the
exposure
is
greater
than
before
the
circulation
and
respiration
being
hurried
the
waste
is
greater
and
as
sound
fuel
can
not
be
immediately
supplied
the
temperature
of
the
body
is
soon
lowered
the
transient
warmth
and
glow
over
the
system
has
both
cold
depression
to
endure
there
is
no
use
in
borrowing
from
yourself
and
fancying
you
are
richer
secondly
the
value
of
any
stimulus
except
in
a
few
exigencies
of
disease
or
injury
is
in
proportion
not
to
the
intensity
but
to
the
equableness
and
durability
of
its
effect
this
is
one
reason
why
tea
coffee
and
articles
of
corresponding
qualities
are
preferable
to
alcoholic
drinks
they
work
so
smoothly
that
their
effect
is
often
unnoticed
and
they
stay
by
well
the
friction
of
alcohol
is
tremendous
in
comparison
a
glass
of
grog
may
help
a
veteran
over
the
fence
but
no
one
young
or
old
can
shoot
all
day
on
whiskey
i
have
had
so
much
experience
in
the
use
of
tobacco
as
a
mild
stimulant
that
i
am
probably
no
impartial
judge
of
its
merits
i
will
simply
say
i
do
not
use
it
in
the
field
because
it
indisposes
to
muscular
activity
and
favors
reflection
when
observation
is
required
and
because
temporary
abstinence
provokes
the
morbid
appetite
and
renders
the
weed
more
grateful
afterwards
thirdly
undue
excitation
of
any
physical
function
is
followed
by
a
corresponding
depression
on
the
simple
principle
that
action
and
reaction
are
equal
and
the
balance
of
health
turns
too
easily
to
be
wilfully
disturbed
stimulation
is
a
draft
upon
vital
capital
when
interest
alone
should
suffice
it
may
be
needed
at
times
to
bridge
a
chasm
but
habitual
living
beyond
vital
income
infallibly
entails
bankruptcy
in
health
the
use
of
alcohol
in
health
seems
practically
restricted
to
purposes
of
sensuous
gratification
on
the
part
of
those
prepared
to
pay
a
round
price
for
this
luxury
the
three
golden
rules
here
are
never
drink
before
breakfast
never
drink
alone
and
never
drink
bad
liquor
their
observance
may
make
even
the
abuse
of
alcohol
tolerable
serious
objections
for
a
naturalist
at
least
are
that
science
viewed
through
a
glass
seems
distant
and
uncertain
while
the
joys
of
rum
are
immediate
and
unquestionable
and
that
intemperance
being
an
attempt
to
defy
certain
physical
laws
is
therefore
eminently
unscientific
besides
the
above
good
advice
by
coues
the
following
may
prove
useful
to
the
camper
diarrhoea
may
result
from
overwork
and
gluttony
combined
and
from
eating
indigestible
or
uncooked
food
and
from
imperfect
protection
of
the
stomach
remove
the
cause
and
the
effect
will
cease
a
flannel
bandage
six
to
twelve
inches
wide
worn
around
the
stomach
is
good
as
a
preventive
and
cure
the
same
causes

produce
cholera
morbus

violent
vomiting
and
purging
faintness
and
spasms

accompanied

if
you
have
them

not

the

the

and
the

therefor
are
noted
on
of

a

a

with
some
people
is

the

rough
poisons
in

cases
of

the
first
step
is
to

this
should
be
effected
by
an
emetic
which
is
obtained

most
powerful
and
speedy
in
its
operation
such
are
powdered

copious
draughts
of

drinks
should
