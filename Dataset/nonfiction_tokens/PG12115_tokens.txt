i
have
to
explain
that
when
the

is
used
in
the
following
pages
it
is
intended
to
include
tasmania
van
diemen
land
and
all
the
islands
in
the
vicinity
of
the
australian
continent
all
bearings
and
courses
unless
it
is
specified
to
the
contrary
are
magnetic
according
to
the
variation
during
the
period
of
the
voyage
the
longitudes
are
generally
given
from
meridians
in

as
i
much

is
accurately
determined
with
reference
to
greenwich
sydney
port
essington
and
swan
river
have
been
the

selected
and
the
respective

of
those

the

for
more
than
half
a
century
the
connection
between
great
britain
and
her
australian
possessions
has
been
one
of
growing
interest
and
men
of
the
highest
eminence
have
foreseen
and
foretold
the
ultimate
importance
of
that
vast
continent
over
which
within
the
memory
of
living
man
the
roving
savage
held
precarious
though
unquestioned
empire
of
the
australian
shores
the
was
the
least
known
and
became
towards
the
close
of
the
year
a
subject
of
much
geographical
speculation
former
navigators
were
almost
unanimous
in
believing
that
the
deep
bays
known
to
indent
a
large
portion
of
this
coast
received
the
waters
of
extensive
rivers
the
discovery
of
which
would
not
only
open
a
route
to
the
interior
but
afford
facilities
for
colonizing
a
part
of
australia
so
near
our
east
indian
territories
as
to
render
its
occupation
an
object
of
evident
importance
his
majesty
government
therefore
determined
to
send
out
an
expedition
to
explore
and
survey
such
portions
of
the
australian
coasts
as
were
wholly
or
in
part
unknown
to
captains
flinders
and
king
sloop
beagle
for
this
service
sloop
beagle
was
commissioned
at
woolwich
in
the
second
week
of
february
by
commander
wickham
who
had
already
twice
accompanied
her
in
her
wanderings
over
the
least
known
and
most
boisterous
waters
of
the
globe
first
in
her
sister
ship
of
discovery
the
adventure
captain
king
and
afterwards
as
first
lieutenant
of
the
sloop
now
entrusted
to
his
command
under
captain
wickham
some
of
the
most
important
objects
of
the
voyage
were
achieved
but
in
consequence
of
his
retirement
in
march
owing
to
ill
health
the
command
of
the
beagle
was
entrusted
to
the
author
of
the
following
pages
and
as
by
a
singular
combination
of
circumstances
no
less
than
three
long
and
hazardous
voyages
of
discovery
have
been
successfully
completed
in
this
vessel
some
account
of
her
here
may
not
be
wholly
uninteresting
the
reader
will
be
surprised
to
learn
that
she
belongs
to
that
class
the
brigs
coffins
as
they
are
not
infrequently
designated
in
the
service
notwithstanding
which
she
has
proved
herself
under
every
possible
variety
of
trial
in
all
kinds
of
weather
an
excellent
sea
boat
she
was
built
at
woolwich
in
and
her
first
exploit
was
the
novel
and
unprecedented
one
of
passing
through
old
london
bridge
the
first
rigged
that
had
ever
floated
so
high
upon
the
waters
of
the
thames
in
order
to
salute
at
the
coronation
of
king
george
the
fourth
voyages
of
the
beagle
towards
the
close
of
the
year
she
was
first
commissioned
by
commander
pringle
stokes
as
second
officer
of
the
expedition
which
sailed
from
plymouth
on
the
of
may
under
the
command
of
captain
phillip
parker
king
an
account
of
which
voyage
published
by
captain
fitzroy
who
ultimately
succeeded
to
the
vacancy
occasioned
by
the
lamented
death
of
captain
stokes
and
who
subsequently
commanded
the
beagle
during
her
second
solitary
but
most
interesting
expedition
has
added
to
the
reputation
of
the
seaman
the
more
enduring
laurels
which
literature
and
science
can
alone
supply
not
related
to
the
author
death
of
captain
stokes
though
painful
recollections
surround
the
subject
it
would
be
hardly
possible
to
offer
an
account
of
the
earlier
history
of
the
beagle
and
yet
make
no
allusion
to
the
fate
of
her
first
commander
in
whom
the
service
lost
upon
the
testimony
of
one
well
qualified
to
judge
an
active
intelligent
and
most
energetic
officer
and
well
has
it
been
remarked
by
the
same
high
authority
that
those
who
have
been
exposed
to
one
of
such
trials
as
his
upon
an
unknown
lee
shore
during
the
worst
description
of
weather
will
understand
and
appreciate
some
of
those
feelings
which
wrought
too
powerfully
upon
his
excitable
mind
the
constant
and
pressing
cares
connected
with
his
responsible
commanded
the
hardships
and
the
dangers
to
which
his
crew
were
of
necessity
exposed
during
the
survey
of
tierra
del
fuego
and
in
some
degree
the
awful
gloom
which
rests
forever
on
that
coast
finally
destroyed
the
equilibrium
of
a
mind
distracted
with
anxiety
and
shattered
by
disease
perhaps
no
circumstance
could
prove
more
strongly
the
peculiar
difficulties
connected
with
a
service
of
this
nature
nor
could
any
more
clearly
testify
that
in
this
melancholy
instance
every
thought
of
was
absorbed
by
a
zeal
to
promote
the
objects
of
the
expedition
which
neither
danger
disappointment
anxiety
nor
disease
could
render
less
earnest
or
less
vigilant
even
to
the
last
the
two
vessels
returned
to
england
in
october
when
the
adventure
was
paid
off
at
woolwich
and
the
beagle
at
plymouth
she
was
recommissioned
by
captain
fitzroy
to
whose
delightful
narrative
allusion
has
been
already
made
on
the
july
and
continued
under
his
command
till
her
return
to
woolwich
in
november
where
after
undergoing
some
slight
repairs
she
was
a
third
time
put
in
commission
for
the
purposes
of
discovery
under
commander
wickham
her
former
first
lieutenant
and
shortly
afterwards
commenced
that
third
voyage
of
the
toils
and
successes
of
which
as
an
humble
contribution
to
the
stores
of
geographical
knowledge
i
have
attempted
in
the
following
pages
to
convey
as
faithful
and
complete
an
account
as
the
circumstances
under
which
the
materials
have
been
prepared
will
allow
nor
will
the
subject
less
interest
myself
when
i
call
to
mind
that
for
eighteen
years
the
beagle
has
been
to
me
a
home
upon
the
wave
that
my
first
cruise
as
a
middy
was
made
in
her
that
serving
in
her
alone
i
have
passed
through
every
grade
in
my
profession
to
the
rank
i
have
now
the
honour
to
hold
that
in
her
i
have
known
the
excitements
of
imminent
danger
and
the
delights
of
long
anticipated
success
and
that
with
her
perils
and
her
name
are
connected
those
recollections
of
early
and
familiar
friendship
to
which
even
memory
herself
fails
to
do
full
justice
the
beagle
was
stripped
to
her
timbers
and
rebuilt
under
this
able
officer
own
inspection
and
among
other
improvements
she
had
the
lightning
conductors
of
the
snow
harris
esquire
fitted
to
her
masts
a
circumstance
to
which
she
has
more
than
once
been
indebted
for
her
safety
admiralty
instructions
the
following
instructions
were
received
by
captain
wickham
previous
to
our
departure
from
woolwich
and
under
them
i
subsequently
acted
by
the
commissioners
for
executing
the
office
of
lord
high
admiral
of
the
united
kingdom
of
great
britain
and
ireland
etc
whereas
his
majesty
surveying
vessel
beagle
under
your
command
has
been
fitted
out
for
the
purpose
of
exploring
certain
parts
of
the
coast
of
new
holland
and
of
surveying
the
best
channels
in
the
straits
of
bass
and
torres
you
are
hereby
required
and
directed
as
soon
as
she
shall
be
in
all
respects
ready
to
repair
to
plymouth
sound
in
order
to
obtain
a
chronometric
departure
from
the
west
end
of
the
breakwater
and
then
to
proceed
with
all
convenient
expedition
to
santa
cruz
in
tenerife
in
the
voyage
there
you
are
to
endeavour
to
pass
over
the
reputed
site
of
the
eight
stones
within
the
limits
pointed
out
by
our
hydrographer
but
keeping
a
strict
lookout
for
any
appearance
of
discoloured
water
and
getting
a
few
deep
casts
of
the
lead
at
tenerife
you
are
to
remain
three
days
for
the
purpose
of
rating
the
chronometers
when
you
are
to
make
the
best
of
your
way
to
bahia
in
order
to
replenish
your
water
and
from
thence
to
simon
bay
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
where
having
without
loss
of
time
obtained
the
necessary
refreshments
you
will
proceed
direct
to
swan
river
but
as
the
severe
gales
which
are
sometimes
felt
at
that
settlement
may
not
have
entirely
ceased
you
will
approach
that
coast
with
due
caution
at
swan
river
you
are
to
land
lieutenants
grey
and
lushington
as
well
as
to
refit
and
water
with
all
convenient
despatch
and
you
are
then
to
proceed
immediately
to
the
coast
of
new
holland
making
the
coast
in
the
vicinity
of
dampier
land
the
leading
objects
of
your
examination
there
will
be
the
extent
of
the
two
deep
inlets
connected
with
roebuck
bay
and
cygnet
bay
where
the
strength
and
elevation
of
the
tides
have
led
to
the
supposition
that
dampier
land
is
an
island
and
that
the
above
openings
unite
in
the
mouth
of
a
river
or
that
they
branch
off
from
a
wide
and
deep
gulf
moderate
and
regular
soundings
extend
far
out
from
cape
villaret
you
will
therefore
in
the
first
instance
make
that
headland
and
keeping
along
the
southern
shore
of
roebuck
bay
penetrate
at
once
as
far
as
the
beagle
and
her
boats
can
find
sufficient
depth
of
water
but
you
must
however
take
care
not
too
precipitately
to
commit
his
majesty
ship
among
these
rapid
tides
nor
to
entangle
her
among
the
numerous
rocks
with
which
all
this
part
of
the
coast
seems
to
abound
but
by
a
cautious
advance
of
your
boats
for
the
double
purpose
of
feeling
your
way
and
at
the
same
time
of
surveying
you
will
establish
her
in
a
judicious
series
of
stations
equally
beneficial
to
the
progress
of
the
survey
and
to
the
support
of
your
detached
people
prince
regent
river
appears
to
have
been
fully
examined
by
captain
king
up
to
its
freshwater
rapids
but
as
the
adjacent
ridges
of
rocky
land
which
were
seen
on
both
sides
of
collier
bay
were
only
laid
down
from
their
distant
appearance
it
is
probable
that
they
will
resolve
themselves
into
a
collection
of
islands
in
the
rear
of
dampier
land
and
it
is
possible
that
they
may
form
avenues
to
some
wide
expanse
of
water
or
to
the
mouth
of
some
large
river
the
discovery
of
which
would
be
highly
interesting
as
this
question
whether
there
are
or
are
not
any
rivers
of
magnitude
on
the
western
coast
is
one
of
the
principal
objects
of
the
expedition
you
will
leave
no
likely
opening
unexplored
nor
desist
from
its
examination
till
fully
satisfied
but
as
no
estimate
can
be
formed
of
the
time
required
for
its
solution
so
no
period
can
be
here
assigned
at
which
you
shall
abandon
it
in
order
to
obtain
refreshments
when
that
necessity
is
felt
it
must
be
left
to
your
own
judgment
whether
to
have
recourse
to
the
town
balli
in
the
strait
of
allas
or
to
the
dutch
settlement
of
coepang
or
even
to
the
arrou
islands
which
have
been
described
as
places
well
adapted
for
that
purpose
but
on
these
points
you
will
take
pains
to
acquire
all
the
information
which
can
be
obtained
from
the
residents
at
swan
river
another
circumstance
which
prevents
any
precise
instructions
being
given
to
you
on
this
head
is
the
uncertainty
that
prevails
here
respecting
the
weather
which
you
may
at
that
period
find
in
those
latitudes
and
which
it
is
possible
may
be
such
as
if
not
altogether
to
prevent
the
execution
of
these
orders
may
at
least
cause
them
to
be
ineffectually
performed
or
perhaps
lead
to
a
waste
of
time
which
might
be
better
employed
on
other
parts
of
the
coast
if
such
should
eventually
be
the
case
it
would
be
prudent
not
to
attempt
this
intricate
part
of
the
coast
during
the
prevalence
of
the
monsoon
but
to
employ
it
in
completing
the
examination
of
shark
bay
and
of
exmouth
gulf
as
well
as
of
other
unexplored
intervals
of
coast
up
to
the
degree
of
longitude
or
with
a
view
to
the
proximity
of
one
of
the
places
of
refreshment
it
might
perhaps
be
advisable
if
compelled
to
quit
the
vicinity
of
dampier
land
to
devote
that
part
of
the
season
to
a
more
careful
investigation
of
the
low
shores
of
the
gulf
of
carpentaria
where
it
has
been
surmised
though
very
loosely
that
rivers
of
some
capacity
will
be
found
the
above
objects
having
been
accomplished
in
whatever
order
you
may
find
suitable
to
the
service
you
will
return
to
the
southern
settlements
for
refreshments
and
then
proceed
during
the
summer
months
of
fine
weather
and
long
days
to
bass
strait
in
which
so
many
fatal
accidents
have
recently
occurred
and
of
which
you
are
to
make
a
correct
and
effectual
survey
but
previous
to
your
undertaking
that
survey
as
it
has
been
represented
to
us
that
it
would
be
very
desirable
for
the
perfection
of
the
tidal
theory
that
an
accurate
register
of
the
times
and
heights
of
high
and
should
be
kept
for
some
time
in
bass
strait
you
will
if
practicable
establish
a
party
for
that
purpose
on
king
island
and
you
are
to
cause
the
above
particulars
of
the
tides
there
to
be
unintermittently
and
minutely
observed
and
registered
in
the
blank
forms
which
will
be
supplied
to
you
by
our
hydrographer
if
however
circumstances
should
render
this
measure
unadvisable
at
that
island
you
will
either
choose
some
less
objectionable
station
where
the
average
tide
in
the
strait
may
be
fairly
registered
or
if
you
can
employ
no
permanent
party
on
this
service
you
will
be
the
more
exact
in
ascertaining
the
above
particulars
at
every
one
of
your
stations
and
in
all
parts
of
this
strait
you
will
carefully
note
the
set
and
strength
of
the
stream
at
the
intermediate
hours
between
high
and
and
also
the
time
at
which
the
stream
turns
in
the
offing
the
survey
of
bass
strait
should
include
first
a
verification
of
the
two
shores
by
which
it
is
formed
secondly
such
a
systematic
representation
of
the
depth
and
quality
of
the
bottom
as
will
ensure
to
any
vessel
which
chooses
to
sound
by
night
or
day
a
correct
knowledge
of
her
position
and
thirdly
a
careful
examination
of
the
passages
on
either
side
of
king
island
as
well
as
through
the
chains
of
rocks
and
islands
which
stretch
across
from
wilson
promontory
to
cape
portland
this
survey
will
of
course
comprehend
the
approach
to
port
dalrymple
but
the
interior
details
of
that
extensive
harbour
may
be
left
to
the
officers
employed
by
the
of
van
diemen
land
provided
you
can
ascertain
that
it
is
his
intention
to
employ
them
there
within
any
reasonable
time
the
number
of
vessels
which
are
now
in
the
habit
of
passing
through
bass
strait
and
the
doubts
which
have
recently
been
expressed
not
only
of
the
just
position
of
the
dangers
it
is
known
to
contain
but
of
the
existence
of
others
show
the
necessity
of
this
survey
being
executed
with
that
care
and
fidelity
which
will
give
confidence
to
all
future
navigators
and
may
therefore
be
more
extensive
in
its
limits
and
occupy
a
larger
portion
of
your
time
than
is
at
present
contemplated
you
must
exercise
your
own
judgment
as
to
the
fittest
period
at
which
you
should
either
repair
to
sydney
to
refit
or
adjourn
to
port
dalrymple
to
receive
occasional
supplies
whenever
this
branch
of
the
service
shall
be
completed
you
are
forthwith
by
a
safe
conveyance
to
transmit
a
copy
of
it
to
our
secretary
that
no
time
may
be
lost
in
publishing
it
for
the
general
benefit
at
sydney
you
will
find
the
stores
which
we
have
ordered
to
be
deposited
there
for
your
use
and
having
carefully
rated
your
chronometers
and
taken
a
fresh
departure
from
the
observatory
near
that
port
and
having
his
majesty
ship
and
fully
completed
her
provisions
you
will
proceed
by
the
inner
route
to
torres
strait
where
the
most
arduous
of
your
duties
are
yet
to
be
performed
the
numerous
reefs
which
block
up
that
strait
the
difficulty
of
entering
its
intricate
channels
the
discordant
result
of
the
many
partial
surveys
which
have
from
time
to
time
been
made
there
and
the
rapidly
increasing
commerce
of
which
it
has
become
the
thoroughfare
call
for
a
full
and
satisfactory
examination
of
the
whole
space
between
cape
york
and
the
southern
shore
of
new
guinea
and
to
this
important
service
therefore
you
will
devote
the
remaining
period
for
which
your
supplies
will
last
in
this
latter
survey
you
will
cautiously
proceed
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
you
will
verify
the
safety
of
endeavour
strait
and
furnish
sufficient
remarks
for
avoiding
its
dangers
you
will
examine
the
three
groups
called
york
prince
of
wales
and
banks
islands
you
will
establish
the
facilities
or
determine
the
dangers
of
passing
through
those
groups
and
by
a
combination
of
all
those
results
you
will
clearly
state
the
comparative
advantages
of
the
different
channels
and
finally
determine
on
the
best
course
for
vessels
to
pursue
which
shall
be
going
in
either
direction
or
in
opposite
seasons
though
with
this
part
of
your
operations
cook
bank
aurora
reef
and
the
other
shoals
in
the
vicinity
will
necessarily
be
connected
yet
you
are
not
to
extend
them
to
the
degree
of
longitude
as
the
examination
of
the
great
field
to
the
eastward
of
that
meridian
must
be
left
to
some
future
survey
which
shall
include
the
barrier
reefs
and
their
ramified
openings
from
the
pacific
ocean
you
are
on
the
contrary
to
proceed
if
practicable
but
most
cautiously
in
examining
the
complicated
archipelago
of
rocks
and
islands
which
line
the
northern
side
of
torres
strait
till
at
length
reaching
new
guinea
you
will
there
ascertain
the
general
character
of
that
part
of
its
shore
whether
it
be
high
and
continuous
or
broken
into
smaller
islands
with
available
channels
between
them
as
has
been
asserted
or
whether
from
being
guarded
by
the
innumerable
reefs
and
dangers
which
are
marked
in
the
charts
it
must
remain
altogether
sealed
to
the
navigator
the
nature
of
the
country
as
well
as
of
its
products
will
also
be
inquiries
of
considerable
interest
and
you
will
perhaps
be
able
to
learn
whether
the
dutch
have
made
any
progress
in
forming
settlements
along
its
shores
and
if
so
you
will
take
especial
care
not
to
come
into
collision
with
any
of
their
authorities
throughout
the
whole
of
this
extensive
region
you
will
bear
in
mind
the
mischievous
disposition
of
the
natives
and
while
you
strictly
practice
that
dignified
forbearance
and
benevolence
which
tend
to
impress
far
higher
respect
for
our
power
than
the
exercise
of
mere
force
you
will
also
be
sedulously
on
your
guard
against
every
surprise
and
though
your
boats
should
always
be
completely
armed
you
will
carefully
avoid
any
conflict
where
the
ignorant
or
misguided
natives
may
presume
on
your
pacific
appearance
or
on
the
disparity
of
your
numbers
you
will
then
turn
to
the
westward
and
pursue
this
part
of
the
survey
so
as
to
determine
the
breadth
of
the
foul
ground
off
the
coast
of
new
guinea
and
the
continuity
or
interrupted
form
of
that
coast
and
you
will
establish
certain
positions
on
the
mainland
if
the
adjacent
sea
be
navigable
and
if
not
on
the
several
advancing
islands
which
may
serve
as
useful
for
vessels
coming
from
the
indian
seas
or
for
points
of
departure
for
those
who
have
passed
through
any
of
these
straits
you
will
thus
continue
a
general
examination
of
this
hitherto
unexplored
coast
as
far
as
cape
valsche
which
is
now
said
to
be
only
the
terminating
point
of
a
chain
of
large
islands
and
then
across
to
the
arrou
islands
which
are
supposed
to
be
remarkably
fertile
to
abound
with
resources
and
refreshments
and
to
be
peopled
by
a
harmless
and
industrious
race
but
which
do
not
appear
to
have
been
visited
by
any
of
his
majesty
ships
the
length
of
time
which
may
be
required
for
the
due
execution
of
all
the
foregoing
objects
can
not
be
foreseen
it
may
exceed
that
for
which
your
supplies
are
calculated
or
on
the
other
hand
a
less
degree
of
the
supposed
complexity
in
the
ground
you
will
have
traversed
along
with
the
energy
and
diligence
with
which
we
rely
on
you
for
conducting
these
important
services
may
enable
you
to
complete
them
within
that
period
in
this
latter
case
you
will
return
to
the
northern
coast
of
new
holland
and
selecting
such
parts
of
it
as
may
afford
useful
harbours
of
retreat
or
which
may
appear
to
comprise
the
mouths
of
any
streams
of
magnitude
you
will
employ
your
spare
time
in
such
discoveries
as
may
more
or
less
tend
to
the
general
object
of
the
expedition
before
your
departure
from
sydney
you
will
have
learnt
that
his
government
has
established
a
new
settlement
at
port
essington
or
somewhere
on
the
north
coast
of
new
holland
and
before
you
finally
abandon
that
district
you
will
visit
this
new
colony
and
contribute
by
every
means
in
your
power
to
its
resources
and
its
stability
we
have
not
in
the
concluding
part
of
these
orders
pointed
out
the
places
or
the
periods
at
which
you
are
to
replenish
your
provisions
because
the
latter
must
depend
on
various
circumstances
which
can
not
be
foreseen
and
the
former
may
be
safely
left
to
your
own
decision
and
prudence
but
when
you
have
been
three
years
on
your
ground
unless
some
very
important
result
were
to
promise
itself
from
an
extension
of
that
period
you
will
proceed
to
the
island
of
mauritius
in
order
to
complete
your
stock
of
water
and
provisions
and
then
touching
at
either
side
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
according
to
the
season
and
afterwards
at
ascension
you
will
make
the
best
of
your
way
to
spithead
and
report
your
arrival
to
our
secretary
directions
will
be
forwarded
to
the
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
in
the
east
indies
and
to
the
governors
or
of
the
several
settlements
at
which
you
have
been
ordered
to
call
to
assist
and
further
your
enterprise
as
far
as
their
means
will
admit
and
you
will
lose
no
opportunity
at
those
several
places
of
informing
our
secretary
of
the
general
outline
of
your
proceedings
and
of
transmitting
traces
of
the
surveys
which
you
may
have
effected
together
with
copies
of
your
tide
and
other
observations
you
will
likewise
by
every
safe
opportunity
communicate
to
our
hydrographer
detailed
accounts
of
all
your
proceedings
which
relate
to
the
surveys
and
you
will
strictly
comply
with
the
enclosed
instructions
which
have
been
drawn
up
by
him
under
our
directions
as
well
as
all
those
which
he
may
from
time
to
time
forward
by
our
command
given
under
our
hands
the
of
june
signed
charles
adam
george
elliott
to
wickham
esquire
commander
of
his
majesty
surveying
vessel
beagle
at
woolwich
by
command
of
their
lordships
signed
john
barrow
nor
should
the
valuable
instructions
of
captain
beaufort
hydrographer
to
the
admiralty
be
forgotten
such
extracts
as
may
probably
prove
of
interest
to
the
general
reader
are
here
subjoined
extracts
from
hydrographer
instructions
the
general
objects
of
the
expedition
which
has
been
placed
under
your
command
having
been
set
forth
in
their
lordship
orders
it
becomes
my
duty
to
enter
somewhat
more
specifically
into
the
nature
and
details
of
the
service
which
you
are
to
perform
their
lordships
having
expressed
the
fullest
reliance
on
your
zeal
and
talents
and
having
cautiously
and
wisely
abstained
from
fettering
you
in
that
division
and
disposition
of
your
time
which
the
periodic
changes
of
the
seasons
or
the
necessities
of
the
vessel
may
require
it
would
ill
become
me
to
enter
too
minutely
into
any
of
those
arrangements
which
have
been
so
flatteringly
left
to
your
discretion
yet
in
order
to
assist
you
with
the
results
of
that
experience
which
has
been
derived
from
the
many
surveys
carried
on
under
the
direction
of
the
admiralty
and
to
ensure
that
uniform
consistency
of
method
in
your
varied
labours
which
will
so
greatly
enhance
their
value
i
will
briefly
touch
on
some
of
the
most
important
subjects
and
repeat
those
instructions
which
their
lordships
have
in
every
former
case
ratified
and
which
it
is
therefore
expected
you
will
bear
in
mind
during
the
whole
progress
of
your
survey
the
first
point
to
which
your
orders
advert
after
quitting
england
is
the
eight
stones
where
you
will
probably
add
one
to
the
many
testimonies
which
have
been
already
collected
of
their
at
least
in
the
place
assigned
to
them
in
the
old
charts
but
before
we
venture
to
expunge
them
it
becomes
a
serious
duty
to
traverse
their
position
in
every
possible
direction
should
the
weather
be
favourable
it
would
be
desirable
while
crossing
their
parallel
to
obtain
one
very
deep
cast
of
the
lead
and
should
that
succeed
in
reaching
the
bottom
the
sacrifice
of
a
few
days
will
be
well
bestowed
in
endeavouring
to
trace
a
further
portion
of
the
bank
a
small
chart
showing
the
tracks
of
various
ships
across
this
place
is
hereto
annexed
and
as
the
meridian
of
degrees
minutes
nearly
bisects
the
two
adjacent
courses
you
are
recommended
to
cross
their
parallel
in
that
longitude
from
the
canary
islands
to
the
coast
of
brazil
and
indeed
throughout
every
part
of
your
voyage
you
should
endeavour
to
pass
over
the
places
of
all
the
reported
vigias
which
lie
near
your
course
either
outward
or
homeward
you
will
perceive
a
multitude
of
them
carelessly
marked
on
every
chart
but
of
some
you
will
find
a
circumstantial
description
in
that
useful
publication
the
nautical
magazine
and
a
day
devoted
to
the
search
of
any
which
will
not
withdraw
you
too
far
from
your
due
course
will
be
well
employed
the
rocks
off
cape
leeuwin
some
near
king
george
sound
the
dangerous
patch
off
kangaroo
island
and
many
others
of
which
accounts
are
given
in
the
above
work
ought
if
possible
to
be
examined
as
more
immediately
appertaining
to
your
own
field
whenever
found
the
depth
nature
and
limits
of
the
banks
on
which
they
stand
should
be
determined
as
they
might
prove
to
be
of
sufficient
extent
to
give
warning
to
the
danger
and
then
a
direct
course
should
be
immediately
made
by
the
beagle
to
the
nearest
land
where
a
convenient
place
should
be
selected
and
its
position
carefully
ascertained
at
swan
river
you
will
have
previously
learnt
from
lieutenant
roe
the
whether
the
rocks
off
kangaroo
island
have
been
again
seen
or
their
position
altered
since
captain
first
description
so
as
to
save
your
time
in
the
search
you
will
no
doubt
obtain
from
that
intelligent
officer
lieutenant
roe
much
important
information
respecting
the
coast
as
well
as
all
the
detached
intelligence
which
during
his
long
residence
there
he
must
have
collected
relating
to
every
part
of
the
shores
of
new
holland
from
him
also
you
will
acquire
many
useful
hints
about
the
places
in
the
indian
sea
where
refreshments
may
be
obtained
as
well
as
some
insight
into
the
disposition
of
the
authorities
and
the
inhabitants
whom
you
will
meet
there
and
he
will
probably
be
able
to
give
you
a
clear
account
of
the
duration
of
the
monsoons
and
their
accompanying
weather
if
at
port
dalrymple
it
should
so
happen
that
you
can
wait
on
sir
john
franklin
it
is
probable
that
he
will
detach
lieutenant
burnett
to
cooperate
with
you
in
the
survey
of
bass
strait
and
it
is
certain
that
the
governor
will
do
everything
in
his
power
to
assist
your
labours
at
sydney
you
will
have
the
advantage
of
seeing
captain
king
whose
long
experience
of
all
those
coasts
as
well
as
of
the
seasons
and
of
the
manner
of
dealing
with
the
inhabitants
will
be
of
the
utmost
use
to
you
and
whose
zeal
for
the
king
service
and
whose
love
of
science
will
lead
him
to
do
everything
possible
to
promote
your
views
if
cunningham
the
government
botanist
be
there
he
also
will
i
am
convinced
eagerly
communicate
to
you
and
your
officers
everything
which
may
be
serviceable
in
the
pursuits
connected
with
natural
history
at
swan
river
at
port
dalrymple
and
at
sydney
it
may
perhaps
be
possible
for
you
to
hire
at
a
low
rate
some
person
acquainted
with
the
dialects
of
the
natives
which
you
are
subsequently
to
visit
and
with
whom
it
will
be
so
essential
to
be
on
friendly
terms
such
a
person
will
greatly
assist
in
that
object
but
you
will
keep
him
on
board
no
longer
than
absolutely
necessary
and
you
will
take
care
to
provide
for
his
return
if
the
beagle
should
not
be
able
to
carry
him
back
general
information
in
such
an
extensive
and
distant
survey
numerous
subjects
of
inquiry
though
not
strictly
nautical
will
suggest
themselves
to
your
active
mind
and
though
from
your
transient
stay
at
any
other
place
you
will
often
experience
the
mortification
of
leaving
them
incomplete
yet
that
should
not
discourage
you
in
the
collection
of
every
useful
fact
within
your
reach
your
example
in
this
respect
will
stimulate
the
efforts
of
the
younger
officers
under
your
command
and
through
them
may
even
have
a
beneficial
influence
on
the
future
character
of
the
navy
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
geologists
that
the
coral
insect
instead
of
raising
its
superstructure
directly
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
works
only
on
the
summits
of
submarine
mountains
which
have
been
projected
upwards
by
volcanic
action
they
account
therefore
for
the
form
so
generally
observed
in
coral
islands
by
supposing
that
they
exist
on
the
circular
lip
of
extinct
volcanic
craters
and
as
much
of
your
work
will
lie
among
islands
and
cays
of
coral
formation
you
should
collect
every
fact
which
can
throw
any
light
on
the
subject
hitherto
it
has
been
made
a
part
of
the
duty
of
all
the
surveying
vessels
to
keep
an
exact
register
of
the
height
of
the
barometer
at
its
two
maxima
of
and
its
two
minima
of
as
well
as
that
of
the
thermometer
at
the
above
periods
and
at
its
own
day
and
night
maximum
and
minimum
as
well
as
the
continual
comparative
temperature
of
the
sea
and
air
this
was
done
with
the
view
of
assisting
to
provide
authentic
data
collected
from
all
parts
of
the
world
and
ready
for
the
use
of
future
labourers
whenever
some
accidental
discovery
or
the
direction
of
some
powerful
mind
should
happily
rescue
that
science
from
its
present
neglected
state
but
those
hours
of
entry
greatly
interfere
with
the
employments
of
such
officers
as
are
capable
of
registering
those
instruments
with
the
precision
and
delicacy
which
alone
can
render
meteorologic
data
useful
and
their
future
utility
is
at
present
so
uncertain
that
it
does
not
appear
necessary
that
you
should
do
more
than
record
twice
a
day
the
height
of
the
former
as
well
as
the
extremes
of
the
thermometer
unless
from
some
unforeseen
cause
you
should
be
long
detained
in
any
one
port
when
a
system
of
these
observations
might
then
be
advantageously
undertaken
there
are
however
some
occasional
observations
which
can
not
fail
of
being
extensively
useful
in
future
investigations
during
the
approach
of
the
periodic
changes
of
wind
and
weather
and
then
the
hygrometer
also
should
find
a
place
in
the
journal
the
mean
temperature
of
the
sea
at
the
equator
or
perhaps
under
a
vertical
sun
these
observations
should
be
repeated
whenever
the
ship
is
in
either
of
those
situations
as
well
in
the
atlantic
as
in
the
pacific
they
should
be
made
far
away
from
the
influence
of
the
land
and
at
certain
constant
depths
suppose
fifty
and
ten
fathoms
and
at
the
surface
also
and
this
last
ought
to
be
again
observed
at

the

of

be

of

with

and
tabulated
for
the
purpose
of
applying
the
requisite
corrections
when

singularly
heavy
showers
which
occur

should
be
made

properly
placed
will
answer
this

receive
the

and
to
deliver
it
into
a
pipe

with
that

of
the
basin
will
show
the
number
of
inches

that
have
fallen
on
an
exaggerated
scale
it
is
unnecessary
to
call
your
attention
to
the
necessity
of
recording
every
circumstance
connected
with
that
highly
interesting
phenomenon
the
aurora
australis
such
as
the
angular
bearing
and
elevation
of
the
point
of
coruscation
the
bearing
also
of
the
principal
luminous
arches
etc
it
has
been
asserted
that
lunar
and
solar
halos
are
not
always
exactly
circular
and
a
general
order
might
therefore
be
given
to
the
officer
of
the

to
measure
their
vertical
and
horizontal
diameters
whenever
they
occur

of

any

account
of
the

arrangements
of
the
great

which
you
are
to
coast
nor
indeed
would
minute
inquiries
on
these
subjects
be
at
all
consistent
with
the
true
objects
of
the
survey
but
to
an
observant
eye
some
facts
will
unavoidably
present
themselves
which
will
be
well
worth
recording
and
the
medical
officers
will
no
doubt
be
anxious
to
contribute
their
share
to
the
scientific
character
of
the

have
now
exhausted
every
subject
to
which
it
can
be
necessary
to
call
the
attention
of
an
officer
of
your
long
experience
and
i
have
therefore
only
further
to
express
my
conviction
that
if
providence
permits
you
to
retain
your
wonted
health
and
activity
you
will
pursue
the
great
objects
of

a

also
during

swung

neither

admiration
and
regret
with
which
my
eye
dwelt
upon
the
quiet
spot
the
evening
before
bidding
it
a

farewell
the

had
sunk

disturbed
its

how
eloquently
that

the

none

took
the

been

were
not

fortunate
on

as
to
obtain
a
distant

of

there
are
few
natural
objects
of

when
so
beheld
rising
at
a

of
some
leagues
in
dim
and
awful
solitude
from
the
bosom
of

seemingly
boundless
waves
that
guard

it
rests
at
first
upon
the
blue
outline
of
the

a
conically
shaped
cloud
hour
after

as
you
approach
the
island
it
seems
to
grow
upon
the
sight
until
at
length
its
broad
reflection
darkens
the
surrounding
waters
i
can
imagine
nothing
better
calculated
than
an
appearance
of
this
kind
to
satisfy
a
beholder
of
the
spherical
figure
of
the
earth
and
it
would
seem
almost
incredible
that
early
navigators
should
have
failed
to
find
conviction
in
the
unvarying
testimonies
of
their
own
experience
which
an
approach
to
every
shore
afforded
in
approaching
the
anchorage
of
santa

vessels
should
close
with
the
shore
and
get
into
soundings
before
as
is
the
general
custom
arriving
abreast
of
the
town
where
from
the
steepness
of
the
bank
and
its
proximity
to
the
shore
they
are
obliged
to
anchor
suddenly
a
practice
never
desirable
and
to
vessels

inconvenient

la
cueva
de
los
guanches
lieutenant
grey
was
most
indefatigable
in
collecting
information
during
the
short
period
of
our
stay
at
the
island
as
an
examination
of
his
interesting
work
will
at
once
satisfy
the
reader
he
explored
a
cave
three
miles
to
the
of
santa
cruz
known
by
tradition
as
la
cueva
de
los
guanches
and
reputed
to
be
a
of
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
of
the
island
it
was
full
of
bones
and
from
the
specimens
he
brought
away
and
also
from
his
description
of
all
that
he
examined
they
appear
to
have
belonged
to
a
race
of
men
besides
the
wine
trade
a
considerable
traffic
is
carried
on
with
the
moors
upon
the
opposite
coast
who
exchange
gums
and
sometimes
ivory
for
cotton
and
calico
prints
and
occasionally
tobacco
trade
with
mogadore
the
chief
port
for
this
trade
is
mogadore
from
whence
ships
not
unfrequently
sail
direct
to
liverpool
a
singular
circumstance
was
mentioned
to
me
by
our
first
lieutenant
emery
as
tending
to
prove
the
existence
of
commercial
intercourse
between
the
various
tribes
in
the
interior
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
coast
at
mogadore
on
the
coast
of
africa
and
mombas
on
the
in
the
year
certain
english
goods
were
recognized
in
the
hands
of
the
moors
at
mogadore
which
had
been
sold
two
years
previously
to
the
natives
at
mombas
the
great
extent
of
territory
passed
over
within
these
dates
renders
this
fact
somewhat
extraordinary
and
it
affords
a
reason
for
regretting
that
we
did
not
keep
possession
of
mombas
which
would
ere
this
have
enabled
us
to
penetrate
into
the
interior
of
africa
we
abandoned
it
at
the
very
time
when
the
tribes
in
the
interior
were
beginning
to
find
out
the
value
of
our
manufactures
especially
calicoes
and
cottons
from
the
best
information
that
lieutenant
emery
had
obtained
among
the
natives
it
seems
certain
that
a
very
large
lake
exists
in
the
interior
its
banks
thickly
studded
with
buildings
and
lying
nearly
due
west
from
mombas
it
was
lieutenant
emery
intention
to
have
visited
this
lake
had
he
remained
longer
at
mombas
the
sultan
son
was
to
have
accompanied
him
an
advantage
which
coupled
with
his
own
knowledge

with
his

popularity
among

have
ensured

success
it
is
to
be
feared
that
so
favourable
an
opportunity
for
clearing
up
the
doubts
and
darkness
which
at
present
beset
geographers
in
attempting
to
delineate
this
unknown
land
will
not

completed
the
necessary
magnetic
observations
and
rated
the
chronometers

sailed
from

on
the
evening
of

it
should
be
noticed
that
the
results
obtained
from
our
observations
for
the
dip
of
the
needle
differed
very
materially
from
those
given
by
former
observers
the
experiments
made
by
lieutenant
grey
in
different
parts
of
the
island
satisfied
us
that
the
variation
could
not
be
imputed
to
merely
local
causes
as
in
obedience
to
our
instructions
we
had
to
examine
and
determine
the
hitherto
doubtful
position
of
certain
rocks
near
the
equator
about
the
meridian
of
degrees
west
longitude
we
were
obliged
to
take
a
course
that
carried
us
far
to
the
eastward
of
the
cape
de
verd
islands
for
this
reason
we
had
the
trade
wind
very
light
we
finally
lost
it
on
the
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
north
and

had
been
for
the
two
previous
days
scarcely

us
on
the
of
august

north

west
and
on
the
morning
of
the

crossed
the
equator
in
longitude
degrees
minutes
west
when
sundry
of
our
crew
and
passengers
underwent
the
usual
ceremonies
in
honour
of
old
father
neptune
a
close
and
careful
search
within
the
limits
specified
in
our
instructions
justified
us
in
certifying
the
of
the
rocks
therein
alluded
to
but
before
we
presume
to
pass
any
censure
upon
those
who
preceded
us
in
the
honours
of
maritime
discovery
and
the
labours
of
maritime
survey
it
will
be
proper
to
bear
in
mind
the
ceaseless
changes
to
which
the
earth
surface
is
subject
and
that
though
our
knowledge
is
but
limited
of
the
phenomena
connected
with
subterranean
and
volcanic
agency
still
in
the
sudden
upheaval
and
subsidence
of
sabrina
and
graham
islands
we
have
sufficient
evidence
of
their
vast
disturbing
power
to
warrant
the
supposition
that
such
might
have
been
the
case
with
the
rocks
for
which
our
search
proved
fruitless
nor
are
these
the
only
causes
that
may
be
assigned
to
reconcile
the
conflicting
testimonies
of
various
navigators
upon
the
existence
of
such
dangers
the
origin
of
which
may
be
ascribed
to
drift

a
succession

with
the

brought

made

the

of
the
about
miles
to
the
of

and
in
the
afternoon
anchored
off
the
town
of
san

though
this
was
neither
my
first
nor
second
visit
to
bahia
i
was
still
not
indifferent
to
the
magnificent
or
rather
luxuriant
tropical
scenery
which
it
presents

bank
of
such
verdure
as
these
climes
alone
supply
rose
precipitously
from
the
dark
blue
water
dotted
with
the
white
and
gleaming
walls
of
houses
and
convents
half
hidden
in
woods
of
every
tint
of
green
while
here
and
there
the
lofty
spires
of
some
christian
temple
pointed
to
a
yet
fairer
world
invisible
to

eye
and
suggested
even
to
the
least
thoughtful
that

as
is
this
lower

for

frail
humanity
state
of
the
country
at
bahia
i
had
last
seen
bahia
in
august
on
the
homeward
voyage
of
the
beagle
and
it
was
then
in
anything
but
a
satisfactory
condition
the
white
population
divided
among
themselves
and
the
slaves
concerting
by
one
bloody
and
desperate
blow
to
achieve
their
freedom
it
did
not
appear
to
have
improved
during
the
intervening
period
a
revolutionary
movement
was
still
contemplated
by
the
more
liberal
section
of
the
brazilians
though
at
the
very
period
they
thus
judiciously
selected
for
squabbling
with
one
another
they
were
living
in
hourly
expectation
of
a
rising
en
masse
of
the
blacks
that
such
an
insurrection
must
sooner
or
later
take
place
and
take
place
with
all
the
most
fearful
circumstances
of
long
delayed
and
complete
revenge
no
unprejudiced
observer
can
doubt
slave
trade
that
selfish
and
policy
which
is
almost
invariably
allied
with
despotism
has
led
to
such
constant
additions
by
importation
to
the
number
of
the
slave
population
that
it
now
exceeds
the
white
in
the
ratio
of
ten
to
one
while
individually
the
slaves
are
both
physically
and
in
natural
capacity
more
than
equal
to
their
sensual
and
degenerate
masters
bahia
and
its
neighbourhood
have
a
bad
eminence
in
the
annals
of
the
brazilian
upwards
of
fifty
some
accounts
say
eighty
cargoes
had
been
landed
there
since
the
beagle
last
visit
nor
is
the
circumstance
to
be
wondered
at
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
the
price
of
a
slave
then
varied
from
to
pounds
and
this
in
a
country
not
abounding
in
money
the
declining
trade
the
internal
disorganization
and
the
rapidly
augmenting
slave
population
of
bahia
all
tend
to
prove
that
the
system
of
slavery
which
the
brazilians
consider
essential
to
the
welfare
of
their
country
operates
directly
against
her
real
interests
the
wonderful
resources
of
the
brazils
will
however
never
be
fully
developed
until
the
brazilians
resolve
to
adopt
the
line
of
policy
suggested
in
captain
fitzroy
interesting
remarks
upon
this
subject
to
encourage
an
industrious
native
population
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
to
declare
the
piratical
are
the
first
necessary
steps
in
that
march
of
improvement
by
which
this
tottering
empire
may
yet
be
preserved
from
premature
decay
results
of
slavery
it
would
however
be
a
vain
imagination
to
suppose
that
this
wiser
and
more
humane
determination
will
be
spontaneously
adopted
by
those
most
implicated
in
this
debasing
and
demoralizing
traffic
indeed
it
appears
from
the
best
information
obtained
on
the
subject
that
since
the
vigilance
of
our
cruizers
has
comparatively
put
a
stop
to
the
trade
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
where
it
has
received
a
great
discouragement
it
has
been
greatly
extended
on
the
east
could
it
but
have
been
foreseen
by
our
government
that
their
efforts
upon
the
west
coast
would
in
proportion
as
they
were
successful
only
tend
to
drive
the
traders
in
human
flesh
to
the
eastward
it
is
probable
that
mombas
would
have
still
been
retained
under
our
dominion
for
such
a
possession
would
have
enabled
us
to
exercise
an
effectual
control
in
that
quarter
as
it
is
it
gives
additional
reason
to
regret
that
the
place
was
ever
abandoned
the
horrors
of
the
passage
horrors
which
no
imagination
can
heighten
no
pen
adequately
portray
are
by
this
alteration
in
the
chief
seat
of
the
accursed
trade
most
fearfully
augmented
the
poor
victims
of
cruelty
and
fraud
and
avarice
in
their
most
repulsive
forms
are
packed
away
between
decks
scarcely
three
feet
high
in
small
vessels
of
or
tons
and
thus
situated
have
to
encounter
the
cold
and
stormy
passage
round
the
cape
the
average
mortality
is
of
course
most
frightful
but
the
smallness
of
the
vessels
employed
decreases
the
risk
of
the
speculators
in
human
flesh
who
consider
themselves
amply
repaid
if
they
save
one
living
cargo
out
of
every
five
embarked
moral
condition
of
the
negroes
in
the
meantime
cargoes
of
slaves
are
almost
weekly
landed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bahia
the
thousand
evils
of
the
vile
system
are
each
day
increasing
and
with
a
rapid
but
unregarded
footstep
the
fearful
hour
steals
on
when
a
terrible
reckoning
of
unrestrained
revenge
will
repay
all
the
accumulated
wrongs
of
the
past
and
write
in
characters
of
blood
an
awful
warning
for
the
future
so
far
as
we
could
learn
no
attempts
are
made
by
the
masters
to
introduce
the
blessings
of
christianity
among
those
whom
they
deprive
of
temporal
freedom
the
slave
is
treated
as
a
valuable
animal
and
nothing
more
the
claims
of
his
kindred
humanity
so
far
forgotten
as
they
relate
to
his
first
unalienable
right
of
personal
freedom
are
not
likely
to
be
remembered
in
his
favour
in
what
concerns
his
coheritage
in
the
sublime
sacrifice
of
atonement
once
freely
offered
for
us
all
he
toils
through
long
and
weary
years
cheered
by
no
other
hope
than
the
far
distant
and
oft
delusive
expectation
that
a
dearly
purchased
freedom
if
for
freedom
blessings
any
price
can
be
too
costly
will
enable
him
to
look
once
more
upon
the
land
of
his
nativity
and
then
close
his
eyes
surrounded
by
the
loved
few
whom
the
ties
of
kindred
endear
even
to
his
rude
nature
it
would
swell
this
portion
of
the
work
to
an
unreasonable
extent
to
give
any
lengthened
details
of
the
working
of
a
system
about
which
among
my
readers
no
two
opinions
can
exist
let
it
suffice
to
say
that
the
europeans
are
generally
better
and
less
exacting
masters
than
the
brazilians
among
the
latter
it
is
a
common
practice
to
send
so
many
slaves
each
day
to
earn
a
certain
fixed
sum
by
carrying
burdens
pulling
in
boats
or
other
laborious
employment
and
those
who
return
at
night
without
the
sum
thus
arbitrarily
assessed
as
the
value
of
their
work
are
severely
flogged

their
presumed
idleness

from

but
it

be
unpardonable
not
to
do
justice

accounts
we
received
of
the
state
of
affairs
at
swan
river
we
sailed
for
that
place
on
the
morning
of
the
of
october
it
should
be
mentioned
that
lieutenant
grey
hearing
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
obtain
a
suitable
vessel
at
swan
river
hired
a
small
schooner
from
this
port
and
sailed
with
his
party
for
hanover
bay
on
the
coast
of
australia
the
day
after
our
departure
his
subsequent
perils
wanderings
and
adventures
having
been
fully
described
in
his
own
published
account
i
need
do
no
more
here
than
allude
to
them
we
encountered
a
good
deal
of
heavy
weather
shifting
winds
and
consequently
irregular
seas
during
our
run
to
swan
river
and
owing
to
the
deep
state
of
our
loaded
little
vessel
her
decks
were
almost
constantly
flooded
for
many
days
we
had
never
less
than
an
inch
and
a
half
of
water
on
them
all
over
and
this
extra
weight
in
our
already
overburdened
craft
did
not
of
course
add
to
her
liveliness
however
she
struggled
on
island
of
amsterdam
and
on
the
of
november
bore
us
in
sight
of
the
island
of
amsterdam
and
in
the
afternoon
passed
to
the
southward
of
it
sufficiently
near
to
determine
its
position
the
summit
of
the
island
which
has
rather
a
peaked
appearance
we
found
to
be
feet
high
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
longitude
degrees
minutes
east
of
greenwich
it
is
singular
that
though
this
island
which
is
almost
a
for
ships
bound
from
the
cape
either
to
new
holland
or
india
has
been
so
long
known
to
all
navigators
of
these
seas
its
true
longitude
should
have
been
till
now
unascertained
the
western
side
presented
the
appearance
of
a
crater
nor
indeed
can
there
be
any
reason
to
doubt
its
volcanic
origin
light
brown
was
the
pervading
colour
upon
the
sides
of
the
island
and
appeared
to
be
caused
by
stunted
bushes
and
grass
the
southern
island
paul
affords
a
good
anchorage
in
fathoms
about
midway
on
its
eastern
side
latitude
degrees
minutes
and
is
in
every
way
preferable
to
the
spot
chosen
for
that
purpose
by
vlaming
in
on
the
side
of
amsterdam
where
landing
is
never
very
easy
and
generally
quite
impracticable
paul
the
well
ascertained
fact
that
water
is
found
in
abundance
at
paul
leads
to
a
very
fair
inference
that
in
this
humid
atmosphere
and
with
a
much
greater
elevation
the
same
essential
commodity
may
be
met
with
at
amsterdam
but
certainly
at
paul
and
most
probably
at
amsterdam
the
rugged
nature
of
the
travelling
over
these
volcanic
islands
would
render
useless
any
attempt
to
water
a
ship
the
following
table
though
it
may
not
possess
much
interest
for
the
general
reader
will
not
be
without
its
value
in
the
eyes
of
my
nautical
brethren
it
shows
the
increase
of
variation
since

from

beagle
as
these
islands
lie
in
the
same
meridian
the
longitude
given
above
of
amsterdam
will
equally
apply
to
paul
they
are
admirably
situated
for
connecting
the
meridians
of
africa
and
australia
we
lost
sight
of
amsterdam
towards
evening
and
flattered
ourselves
that
we
were
also
leaving
the
bad
weather
behind
the
sky
more
settled
the
sea
less
high
and
the
barometer
rising
such
indications
however
can
not
be
implicitly
trusted
in
this
boisterous
climate
and
shortly
after
dark
having
shipped
a
very
heavy
sea
we
rounded
too
for
the
night
the
constant
set
of
the
huge
following
seas
carried
our
little
vessel
much
faster
to
the
eastward
than
could
be
easily
credited
till
proved
by
actual
observation
during
the
last
three
or
four
days
we
had
run
upwards
of
miles
daily
by
the
observations
being
from
twenty
to
thirty
more
each
day
than
appeared
from
the
reckoning
rottnest
island
we
made
rottnest
island
on
the
morning
of
wednesday
november
and
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
anchored
in
gage
road
swan
river
our
position
at
midnight
the
night
before
made
us
about
miles
from
the
mainland
when
we
had
the
wind
from
the
eastward
getting
round
again
towards
noon
to
south
and
by
west
this
may
be
some
guide
to
the
limit
of
the
land
wind
and
as
such
i
record
the
fact
during
the
three
days
previous
to
our
making
the
land
we
experienced
a
northerly
current
of
one
knot
per
hour
we
tried
during
the
same
period
for
soundings
with
nearly
fathoms
but
in
vain
we
passed
along
the
north
shore
of
rottnest
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
closing
with
it
as
we
got
to
the
eastward
where
it
is
not
so
rocky
the
north
shore
should
not
be
approached
within
a
mile
as
we
were
opening
out
the
bay
on
the
end
of
the
island
we
passed
over
a
rocky
patch
with
from
appearance
not
more
than
three
fathoms
on
it
it
is
small
and
we
had
fathoms
close
to
it
this
patch
is
about
one
mile
north
by
west
from
the
point
of
the
bay
off
this
point
is
a
low
rocky
islet
and
when
on
the
shoal
we
could
just
make
out
the
white
sandy
beach
in
the
bay
open
between
it
and
the
point
the
western
points
of
the
island
are
all
shut
in
by
the
north
point
therefore
keeping
them
open
will
always
enable
the
navigator
to
give
this
dangerous
a
wide
berth
now
called
roe
patch
swan
river
settlement
the
swan
river
settlement
which
is
a
portion
of
the
colony
of

was
founded
in
august
under
the
auspices
of
the
colonial
office

about
nine
miles
inland
the

guildford
and

are
the
other
chief
places
in
the
colony
there
is
nothing
very
particularly
inviting

the
first

of

downs
backed
by
a
slightly
undulating
range
of
hills
rising
to
nearly
feet
high
are
the
chief
natural
features
of
the
prospect

of
which
it
was
wittily
said
by
the
quartermaster
of
one
of
his
majesty
ships
who
visited
the
place
you
might
run
it
through
an
hourglass
in
a
day
is
but
a
collection
of
low
white
houses
scattered
over
the
scarce
whiter
sand
the
only
conspicuous
landmark
visible
in
approaching
the
anchorage
is
the
jail
rather
a
singular
pharos
for
a
settlement
in
australia
which
boasts
its
uncontaminated
state
this
building
i
afterwards
induced
the
governor
to
have
and
it
now
forms
an
excellent
mark
to
point
out
the
river
as
well
as
the
town
a
large
patch
of
white
sand
on
the
coast
about
three
miles
to
the
northward
of
swan
river
also
serves
as
a
landmark
shortly
after
our
arrival
i
was
introduced
to
the
governor
sir
james
stirling
he
and
all
those
here
best
qualified
to
judge
joined
in
regretting
that
lieutenant
grey
had
not
decided
to
come
on
with
us
the
accounts
we
heard
of
the
country
and
the
natives
gave
us
every
reason
to
entertain
but
slender
hopes
of
his
success
an
inland
lake
sir
james
and
roe
the
appeared
to
coincide
with
the
general
opinion
that
a
large
inland
lake
will
ultimately
be
discovered
they
had
questioned
many
of
the
natives
about
it
who
all
asserted
its
existence
and
pointed
in
a
direction
to
indicate
its
position
their
notions
of
distance
are
to
say
the
least
exceedingly
rude
with
them
everything
is
far
away
far
away
the
size
of
this
water
the
natives
describe
by
saying
that
if
a
boy
commenced
walking
round
it
by
the
time
he
finished
his
task
he
would
have
become
an
old
man
after
all
may
not
this
be
the
great
australian
bight
that
these
natives
have
heard
of
for
none
we
met
in
western
australia
pretended
to
have
seen
it
they
derive
their
information
from
the
eastern
tribes
and
under
such
circumstances
it
must
at
least
be
considered
extremely
vague
this
lake
which
it
was
the
assumed
labour
of
a
life
to
circumambulate
was
discovered
in
january
by
landor
and
lefroy
who
found
it
about
miles
from
beverley
it
is
quite
salt
called
dambeling
and
about
fifteen
miles
long
by
seven
and
a
half
broad
the
had
lately
returned
from
an
exploring
journey
to
the
eastward
of
the
capital
and
reported
that
there
existed
no
reasonable
probability
of
extending
the
colony
in
that
direction
he
strongly
recommended
us
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
coast
and
return
again
to
swan
river
to
recruit
saying
that
we
should
find
the
heat
there
too
great
to
remain
for
a
longer
period
this
course
captain
wickham
after
due
deliberation
resolved
to
adopt
and
accordingly
all
the
stores
not
absolutely
required
were
forthwith
landed
and
the
ship
made
in
every
respect
as
airy
as
possible
the
november
was
fixed
for
our
departure
when
most
unfortunately
captain
wickham
while
on
his
way
to
perth
was
attacked
with
a
severe
dysentery
and
continued
so
ill
that
he
could
not
be
brought
to
the
ship
till
the
end
of
december
the
most
that
could
be
effected
was
done
to
improve
this
unavoidable
delay
and
our
tidal
observations
before
commenced
were
more
diligently
pursued
we
found
the
greatest
rise
only
inches
and
here
as
elsewhere
on
the
australian
coast
we
observed
the
remarkable
phenomenon
of
only
one
tide
in
the
hours
surveying
operations
were
also
entered
on
connecting
rottnest
island
with
the
mainland
the
dangers
which
surround
it
as
well
as
those
which
lie
between
its
shores
and
the
coast
were
discovered
and
laid
down
this
survey
of
great
importance
to
the
interests
of
shipping
in
these
waters
was
ultimately
completed
on
our
subsequent
visits
to
swan
river
that
arid
appearance
which
first
meets
the
settler
on
his
arrival
and
to
which
allusion
has
already
been
made
can
not
but
prove
disheartening
to
him
particularly
if
as
is
generally
the
case
his
own
sanguine
expectations
of
a
second
paradise
have
been
heightened
by
the
interested
descriptions
of
land
jobbers
and
emigration
agents
approach
to
perth
however
when
he
ascends
the
river
towards
the
capital
this
feeling
of
despondency
will
gradually
wear
away
its
various
windings
bring
to
his
eager
and
anxious
eye
many
a
bright
patch
of
woodland
while
the
river
expanding
as
he
proceeds
till
the
beautiful
estuary
of
melville
water
opens
out
before
him
becomes
really
a
magnificent
feature
in
the
landscape
and
the
boats
passing
and
repassing
upon
its
smooth
and
glassy
bosom
give
the
animation
of
industry
and
suggest
all
the
cheerful
anticipations
of
ultimate
success
to
the
resolute
adventurer
from
about
the
centre
of
this
piece
of
water
the
eye
first
rests
upon
the
capital
of
western
australia
a
large
straggling
village
partly
concealed
by
the
abrupt
termination
of
a
woody
ridge
and
standing
upon
a
picturesque
slope
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
thirteen
miles
from
its
mouth
the
distant
range
of
the
darling
mountains
supplies
a
splendid
background
to
the
picture
and
the
refreshing
seabreeze
which
curls
the
surface
of
melville
water
every
afternoon
adds
to
the
health
no
less
than
comfort
of
the
inhabitants
the
former
inconvenience
caused
by
the
shoal
approach
and
which
rendered
landing
at
a
most
uncomfortable
operation
has
now
been
remedied
by
the
construction
of
a
jetty
like
all
the
australian
rivers
with
which
we
are
yet
acquainted
the
swan
is
subject
to
sudden
and
tremendous
floods
which
inundate
the
corn

in
its
vicinity
and
sweep
away
all
opposing
obstacles
with
irresistible
impetuosity
narrow
escape
of
the
first
settlers
the
first
settlers
had
a
most
providential
escape
from
a
calamity
of
this
kind
they
had
originally
selected
for
the
site
of
their
new
city
a
piece
of
land
which
during
the
first
winter
after
their
arrival
was
visited
with
one
of
these
strange
and
unexplained
invasions
from
the
swelling
stream
had
the
deluge
been
delayed
for
another
year
these
luckless
inhabitants
of
a
new
world
would
have
shared
the
fate
of
those
to
whom
noah
preached
in
vain
but
warned
in
time
they
chose
some
safer
spot
from
whence
in
future
they
and
their
descendants
may
safely
contemplate
the
awful
grandeur
of
similar
occurrences
and
thankfully
profit
by
the
fertility
and
abundance
which
succeed
to
such
wholesale
irrigation
during
this
our
first
visit
i
had
no
opportunity
of
penetrating
into
the
country
further
than
the
darling
range
in
journeying
thither
we
passed
through
guildford
a
township
on
the
banks
of
the
swan
about
seven
miles
from
perth
and
four
from
the
foot
of
the
mountains
it
stands
upon
a
high
part
of
the
alluvial
flat
fringing
the
river
and
which
extends
from
half
to
one
mile
from
it
on
either
side
the
rich
quality
of
the
soil
may
be
imagined
from
the
fact
that
in
after
thirteen
years
of
successive
cropping
it
produced
a
more
abundant
harvest
than
it
had
done
at
first
without
any
artificial
aid
from
manures
singular
flight
of
strange
birds
a
singular
flight
of
strange
birds
was
noticed
at
guildford
about
the
year
during
the
time
when
the
corn
was
green
they
arrived
in
an
innumerable
host
and
were
so
tame
as
to
be
easily
taken
by
hand
in
general
appearance
they
resembled
the
but
were
larger
and
quite
as
heavy
on
the
wing
they
disappeared
in
the
same
mysterious
manner
as
they
arrived
and
have
never
since
repeated
their
visit
were
these
birds
visitors
from
the
interior
or
had
they
just
arrived
at
the
end
of
a
migratory
journey
from
some
distant
country
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
no
specimen
of
them
was
to
be
obtained
as
it
might
have
helped
to
clear
an
interesting
subject
from
doubt
the
darling
range
the
change
in
ascending
this
range
from
the
alluvium
near
its
base
to
the
primitive
formation
of
which
it
is
itself
composed
is
very
remarkable
shells
still
common
on
the
adjacent
coasts
were
met
with
feet
below
the
surface
near
the
foot
of
the
range
by
one
of
the
colonists
when
sinking
a
well
in
the
same
locality
deposits
of
sand
may
be
seen
having
that
particular
wavy
appearance
which
is
always
noticed
upon
the
sea
beach
these
appearances
as
well
as
the
general
aspect
of
the
adjacent
country
seem
to
justify
the
conclusion
i
arrived
at
while
on
the
spot
that
the
land
which
now
intervenes
between
the
mountains
and
the
shore
is
a
comparatively
recent
conquest
from
the
sea
the
character
of
this
land
may
be
thus
described
the
first
three
miles
from
the
coast
is
occupied
with
ridges
of
hills
from
to
feet
high
of
calcareous
limestone
formation
cropping
out
in
such
innumerable
points
and
odd
shapes
as
to
be
almost
impassable
some
of
these
lumps
resemble
a
large
barnacle
both
lumps
and
points
are
covered
with
long
coarse
grass
and
thus
concealed
become
a
great
hindrance
to
the
pedestrian
who
is
constantly
wounded
by
them
to
these
ridges
succeed
sandy
forest
land
and
low
hills
except
on
the
banks
of
the
rivulets
where
a
belt
of
alluvial
soil
is
to
be
found
the
darling
range
traverses
the
whole
of
western
australia
in
a
direction
generally
speaking
north
and
south
it
appears
to
subside
towards
the
north
and
its
greatest
elevation
is
nearly
feet
the
cliffs
of
the
coast
at
the
mouth
of
swan
river
have
a
most
singular
appearance
as
though
covered
with
thousands
of
roots
twisted
together
into
a
species
of
network
a
singular
cliff
a
similar
curiosity
is
to
be
seen
on
bald
head
in
king
george
sound
so
often
alluded
to
by
former
navigators
and
by
them
mistaken
either
for
coral
or
petrified
trees
standing
where
they
originally
grew
bald
head
was
visited
by
darwin
in
company
with
captain
fitzroy
in
february
and
his
opinions
upon
the
agencies
of
formation
so
exactly
coincide
with
those
to
which
i
attribute
the
appearances
at
head
that
i
can
not
do
better
than
borrow
his
words
he
says
page
volume
according
to
our
views
the
rock
was
formed
by
the
wind
heaping
up
calcareous
sand
during
which
process
branches
and
roots
of
trees
and
were
enclosed
the
mass
being
afterwards
consolidated
by
the
percolation
of
rain
water
when
the
wood
had
decayed
lime
was
washed
into
the
cylindrical
cavities
and
became
hard
sometimes
even
like
that
in
a
stalactite
the
weather
is
now
wearing
away
the
softer
rock
and
in
consequence
the
casts
of
roots
and
branches
project
above
the
surface
their
resemblance
to
the
stumps
of
a
dead
shrubbery
was
so
exact
that
before
touching
them
we
were
sometimes
at
a
loss
to
know
which
were
composed
of
wood
and
which
of
calcareous
matter
for
more
exact
details
the
reader
should
consult
volume
on
volcanic
islands
the
natives
we
were
much
struck
during
our
stay
by
the
contrast
between
the
natives
here
and
those
we
had
seen
on
the
beagle
former
voyage
at
king
george
sound
the
comparison
was
wholly
in
favour
of
those
living
within
the
influence
of
their
civilized
a
fact
which
may
surprise
some
of
my
readers
but
for
which
notwithstanding
i
am
quite
prepared
to
vouch
a
better
quality
and
more
certain
supply
of
food
are
the
causes
to
which
this
superiority
ought
to
be
attributed
they
are
indeed
exceedingly
fond
of
wheaten
bread
and
work
hard
for
the
settlers
in
cutting
wood
and
carrying
water
in
order
to
obtain
it
individually
they
appear
peaceable
inoffensive
and
and
under
proper
management
make
very
good
servants
but
when
they
congregate
together
for
any
length
of
time
they
are
too
apt
to
relapse
into
the
vices
of
savage
life
among
the
many
useful
hints
for
which
we
were
indebted
to
roe
was
that
of
taking
a
native
with
us
to
the
northward
and
accordingly
after
some
trouble
we
shipped
an
intelligent
young
man
named
miago
he
proved
in
some
respects
exceedingly
useful
and
made
an
excellent
waiter
we
noticed
that
like
most
of
the
natives
he
was
deeply
scarred
and
i
learned
from
him
that
this
is
done
to
recommend
them
to
the
notice
of
the
ladies
like
all
savages
they
are
treacherous
for
uncivilized
man
has
no
abstract
respect
for
truth
and
consequently
deceit
whether
spoken
or
acted
seems
no
baseness
in
his
eyes
anecdotes
of
the
natives
i
heard
an
anecdote
at
perth
that
bears
upon
this
subject
a
native
of
the
name
of
tonquin
asked
a
settler
who
lived
some
distance
in
the
interior
permission
to
spend
the
night
in
his
kitchen
of
which
that
evening
another
native
was
also
an
inmate
it
seems
that
some
hate
either
personal
or
the
consequences
of
a
quarrel
between
their
different
tribes
existed
in
the
mind
of
tonquin
towards
his
hapless
fellow
lodger
and
in
the
night
he
speared
him
through
the
heart
and
then
very
quietly
laid
down
to
sleep
of
course
in
the
morning
no
little
stir
took
place
tonquin
was
accused
but
stoutly
denied
the
charge
so
satisfied
however
was
the
owner
of
the
house
of
the
guilt
of
the
real
culprit
that
had
he
not
made
his
escape
he
would
have
been
executed
red
hand
as
the
border
wardens
used
to
say
by
the
man
the
sanctity
of
whose
he
had
thus
profaned
tonquin
afterwards
declared
that
he
never
slept
for
nearly
a
fortnight
being
dogged
from
place
to
place
by
the
footsteps
of
the
avengers
of
blood
he
escaped
however
with
his
life
though
worn
almost
to
a
shadow
by
constant
anxiety
when
i
saw
him
some
years
afterwards
i
thought
him
the
finest
looking
native
i
had
ever
seen
but
he
was
apparently
as
those
who
knew
him
best
reported
him
to
be
insane
if
not
the
memory
of
his
crime
and
the
consequent
remorse
which
it
entailed
upon
him
perhaps
the
fugitive
life
he
was
compelled
to
lead
in
order
to
avoid
the
wrath
of
human
retribution
had
been
used
to
make
manifest
the
anger
of
heaven
for
this
breach
of
one
of
those
first
great
laws
of
human
society
which
are
almost
as
much
instincts
of
our
nature
as
revelations
from
the
creator
to
the
creatures
of
his
will
superstitions
the
natives
have
a
superstitious
horror
of
approaching
the
graves
of
the
dead
of
whom
they
never
like
to
speak
and
when
induced
to
do
so
always
whisper
a
settler
residing
in
a
dangerous
part
of
the
colony
had
two
soldiers
stationed
with
him
as
a
guard
upon
one
occasion
five
natives
rushed
in
at
a
moment
when
the
soldiers
were
unprepared
for
their
reception
and
a
terrible
struggle
ensued
the
soldiers
however
managed
while
on
the
ground
to
shoot
two
of
them
and
bayonetted
the
remaining
three
the
five
were
afterwards
buried
before
the
door
nor
could
a
more
perfect
safeguard
have
been
devised
no
thought
even
of
revenge
for
their
comrades
would
afterwards
induce
any
of
the
tribe
to
pass
that
fearful
boundary
their
most
curious
superstition
however
remains
to
be
recorded
it
is
the
opinion
they
confidently
entertain
and
which
seems
universally
diffused
among
them
that
the
white
people
are
their
former
fellow
countrymen
who
in
such
altered
guise
revisit
the
world
after
death
miago
assured
me
that
this
was
the
current
opinion
and
my
own
personal
observation
subsequently
confirmed
his
statement
at
perth
one
of
the
settlers
from
his
presumed
likeness
to
a
defunct
member
of
the
tribe
of
the
murray
river
was
visited
by
his
supposed
kindred
twice
every
year
though
in
so
doing
they
passed
through
sixty
miles
of
what
was
not
unfrequently
an
enemy
country
their
religious
opinions
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
obtain
any
information
on
the
subject
are
exceedingly
vague
and
indefinite
that
they
do
not
regard
the
grave
as
man
final
resting
place
may
however
be
fairly
concluded
from
the
superstition
i
have
just
alluded
to
and
that
they
believe
in
invisible
and
superior
powers
objects
of
dread
and
fear
rather
than
veneration
or
love
has
been
testified
in
captain
grey
most
interesting
chapter
upon
native
customs
and
confirmed
by
my
own
experience
the
evil
spirit
i
used
sometimes
to
question
miago
upon
this
point
and
from
him
i
learned
their
belief
in
the
existence
of
an
evil
spirit
haunting
dark
caverns
wells
and
places
of
mystery
and
gloom
and
called
jinga
i
heard
from
a
settler
that
upon
one
occasion
a
native
travelling
with
him
refused
to
go
to
the
well
at
night
from
fear
of
this
malevolent
being
supposed
to
keep
an
especial
guardianship
over
fresh
water
and
to
be
most
terrible
and
most
potent
in
the
hours
of
darkness
miago
had
never
seen
this
object
of
his
fears
but
upon
the
authority
of
the
elders
of
his
tribe
he
described
its
visible
presence
as
that
of
a
huge
serpent
and
in
the
night
when
the
tall
forest
trees
moaned
and
creaked
in
the
fitful
wind
he
would
shrink
terrified
by
the
solemn
and
mysterious
sounds
which
then
do
predispose
the
mind
to
superstitious
fears
and
tell
how
at
such
a
time
his
countrymen
kindle
a
fire
to
avert
the
actual
presence
of
the
evil
spirit
and
wait
around
it
chanting
their
uncouth
and
rhythmical
incantations
with
fear
and
trembling
for
the
coming
dawn
i
have
preserved
these
anecdotes
here
because
i
can
vouch
for
their
authenticity
and
though
individually
unimportant
they
may
serve
to
throw
additional
light
upon
the
manners
customs
and
traditions
of
the
aborigines
of
australia
but
to
all
really
interested
in
the
subject
i
would
recommend
a
perusal
of
captain
grey
second
volume
i
have
as
yet
neither
space
nor
materials
to
attempt
any
detailed
account
of
the
customs
superstitions
or
condition
of
this
strange
people
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
pass
them
by
quite
unnoticed
nor
can
the
voyager
whose
chief
object
is
to
make
their
native
land
a
field
for
the
exertions
of
british
enterprise
be
wholly
indifferent
to
the
manner
in
which
our
dominion
may
affect
them
the
history
of
almost
every
colony
founded
by
european
energy
has
been
one
fearful
catalogue
of
crime
and
though
by
the
side
of
the
spanish
dutch
and
portuguese
english
adventurers
seem
gentle
and
benevolent
still
cruelty
and
oppression
have
too
often
disgraced

to
the
time
that
must
elapse
ere

can
look
onward
with
confidence
to
a
period
i
trust
not
far
remote
when
throughout
the

shall
attest

on
thursday
january
devoting
several
hours
to
sounding
between
rottnest
and
the
main
we
bore
away
at
to
search
for
a
bank
said
to
exist
about
fifteen
miles
north
from
the
middle
of
rottnest
island
having
from
twenty
to
fathoms
over
it
near
the
position
assigned
we
certainly
shoaled
our
water
from
to
fathoms
but
no
other
indication
of
a
bank
was
to
be
found
satisfied
that
we
had
now
no
further
reason
for
delay
we
kept
away
with
a
fresh
southerly
wind
and
the
glad
omen
of
a
brilliant
sunset
january
we
were
rather
surprised
to
find
by
our
observation
at
noon
no
indication
of
a
northerly
current
though
yesterday
when
becalmed
between
rottnest
and
the
main
we
were
drifted
to
the
northward
at
the
rate
of
nearly
two
knots
per
hour
we
sounded
regularly
every
four
hours
but
found
no
bottom
at
fathoms
the
wind
during
the
morning
was
light
from
but
during
the
night
we
had
it
fresh
from
january
we
passed
at
midnight
within
miles
of
the
position
assigned
in
the
chart
to
the
low
coral
group
known
as
houtman
abrolhos
and
again
sounded
unsuccessfully
with
fathoms
subsequent
observations
placed
these
islands
miles
more
to
the
eastward
than
the
position
there
assigned
them
our
track
therefore
was
really
miles
from
them
we
continued
steering
a
northerly
course
up
to
the
keeping
within
from
to
miles
distance
of
the
coast
and
repeating
our
soundings
every
six
hours
without
success
indications
of

the

during
each
day
was
moderate
from
the
and
south
by
west
freshening
during
the
night
from
south
and
south
by
east
a
heavy
swell
was
its
constant
companion
and
the
barometer
fell
to
on
the
morning
of
the
being
in
the
parallel
of

our
course
was
altered
to
by
east
it
blew
hard
during
the
night
and
we
had
a
disagreeable
sea
but
as
usual
it
moderated
again
towards
the
morning
we
had
shaped
a
course
to
make
a
reef
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
and
named
after
its
discoverer
lieutenant
ritchie
but
owing
to
its
being
situated
as
we
afterwards
found
half
a
degree
to
the
eastward
of
its
assigned
position
in
the
charts
we
did
not
see
it
at
and
with
fathoms
we
reached
a
bottom
of

being
then
about
miles
from

us
to
our

and
into
a
depth
of
fathoms
with
the

kind
of
bottoms
miles
from

morning
position
captain
king
had
and
fathoms
from
this
we
may
suppose
the
edge
of
the
bank
of
soundings
extending
off
this
part
of
the
coast
to
be
very
steep
these
soundings
together
with
those
of
captain
king
as
above
may
give
some
idea
of
the
nature
and
extent
of
this
bank
which
seems
to
be
a
continuation
of
the
flat
extending
miles
connecting
barrow
and
tremouille
islands
with
the
main
its
outer
edge
being
kept
heaped
up
thus

the
constant

we
continued

at

miles
from

had
deepened
to

a
fine
white
sand
and
powdered
shells
before
we
were
miles
from
our
noon
position
we
could
find
no
bottom
with
fathoms
january
we
made
but
slow
progress
during
the
night
and
felt
delay
the
more
tedious
from
the
eager
anxiety
with
which
we
desired
sight
of
the
land
where
our
duties
were
to
begin
in
earnest
we
were
not
successful
with
our
soundings
till
when
we
had
the
same
kind
of
bottom
as
before
described
with
fathoms
miles
east
by

from
our
noon
position
which
was
miles
west
by

from

in
the

direction
from
our
noon
position
we
shoaled
our
water
to
fathoms
the
ground
retaining
the
same
distinctive
character
we
had
the
wind
from
to
during
the
afternoon
but
at
it
chopped
round
to
when
too
for
the
first
time
we
perceived
lightning
to
the
barometer
thermometer
january
the
preceding
indications
of
the
coming
squall
which
had
given
us
full
time
for
preparation
were
realized
about
one
this
morning
when
it
reached
us
though
only
moderately
from
it
was
preceded
by
the
rise
and
rapid
advance
of
a
black
cloud
in
that
quarter
just
as
captain
king
has
described
atmospheric
temperature
at
noon
we
were
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
longitude
degrees
minutes
east
and
in
soundings
of
fathoms
fine
white
sand
broken
shells
and
fragments
of
dead
coral
there
was
only
a
slight
variation
in
the
atmospheric
temperature
of
two
degrees
during
the
hours
the
highest
in
the
day
being
and
the
lowest
at
night
the
water
was
very
smooth
but
as
night
approached
it
thundered
and
lightened
heavily
and
vividly
and
most
of
us
noticed
and
suffered
from
a
particularly
oppressive
and
overpowering
state
of
the
atmosphere
which
the
heat
indicated
by
the
thermometer
was
by
no
means
sufficiently
intense
to
account
for
january
during
the
last
hours
we
had
made
but
miles
progress
in
the
direction
of
roebuck
bay
our
noon
observations
placed
us
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
longitude
degrees
minutes
east
being
about
miles
from
the
nearest
land
we
obtained
soundings
at
fathoms
yellow
sand
and
broken
shells
during
the
afternoon
it
being
nearly
a
calm
we
found
ourselves
surrounded
by
quantities
of
fish
about
the
size
of
the
mackerel
and
apparently
in
pursuit
of
a
number
of
small
and
almost
transparent
members
of
the
finny
tribe
not
larger
than
the
minnow
we
sounded
at
sunset
and
found
bottom
at
fathoms
which
shoaled
by
ten
to
the
circumstance
however
occasioned
no
surprise
as
we
had
run
miles
in
a
direct
line
for
that
low
portion
of
the
coast
from
which
the
flat
we
were
running
over
extends
the
first
part
of
the
night
we
had
the
wind
at
the
breeze
steady
and
the
water
as
smooth
as
glass
but
as
the
watch
wore
on
quick
flashes
of
forked
lightning
and
the
suspicious
appearance
of
gathering
clouds
in
the
gave
warning
of
the
unwelcome
approach
of
a
heavy
squall
heavy
squall
at
eleven
we
lay
becalmed
for
ten
minutes
between
two
contending
winds
that
from
the
south
however
presently
prevailed
and
shifting
to
the
blew
hard
meantime
a
dark
mass
of
clouds
in
the
appeared
suddenly
to
assume
the
form
of
a
archway
and
moved
rapidly
towards
us
in
a
few
minutes
the
ship
was
heeling
majestically
to
the
passing
gust
the
lightning
flashed
vividly
and
rapidly
around
us
alternately
concealing
and
revealing
the
troubled
surface
of
the
sea
while
the
thunder
rolled
heavily
over
our
heads
the
squall
was
heavy
while
it
lasted
commencing
at
and
ending
at
it
was
accompanied
by
heavy
rain
towards
the
end
of
the
middle
watch
the
weather
began
to
assume
a
more
settled
appearance
and
we
had
a
moderate
breeze
from
the
north
but
between
five
and
six
it
shifted
suddenly
by
the
west
to
and
became
light
we
sounded
repeatedly
during
the
night
in
from
to
fathoms
the
same
kind
of
bottom
as
before
which
we
found
agree
very
well
with
those
reported
in
the
account
of
the
french
expedition
under
captain
baudin
from
the
specimens
of
the
squalls
we
experienced
the
last
two
nights
and
which
appear
to
be
pretty
regular
in
their
visitation
i
am
inclined
to
believe
they
do
not
extend
any
considerable
distance
from
the
land
they
give
the
seaman
ample
warning
of
their
approach
yet
since
they
always
come
on
in
the
night
when
their
violence
can
not
be
properly
estimated
the
ship
head
should
if
circumstances
permit
be
kept
to
the
westward
until
the
fury
of
the
storm
has
exhausted
itself
january
we
progressed
with
light
and
variable
airs
through
the
day
gradually
shoaling
our
water
till
nine
when
the
anchor
was
dropped
in
fathoms
having
previously
passed
over
a
rocky
ledge
of
apparently
coral
formation
in
fathoms
the
land
over
the
south
point
of
roebuck
bay
bore
about
miles
distant
but
we
did
not
see
it
till
the
following
morning
driven
from
the
anchorage
the
evening
wore
a
threatening
aspect
though
not
apparently
so
much
to
be
dreaded
as
that
of
yesterday
however
we
were
disagreeably
out
in
our
anticipations
for
about
three
january
a
heavy
squall
burst
on
us
veering
from
to
broke
our
best
bower
anchor
and
drove
us
half
a
mile
out
to
sea
when
the
remaining
fluke
hooked
a
rock
and
brought
us
up
it
rained
and
blew
till
daylight
then
we
were
again
favoured
with
fine
weather
and
light
westerly
winds
the
land
was
now
in
sight
cape
villaret
being
the
most
northerly
point
and
bearing
some
or
miles
the
hillock
upon
this
cape
and
two
other
hummocks
lying
to
the
southward
formed
the
only
prominent
features
of
the
low
land
in
sight
cape
villaret
at
this
anchorage
the
set
east
and
by
north
from
one
to
one
and
a
half
knots
per
hour
before
weighing
i
procured
a
specimen
of
live
coral
from
the
depth
of
fathoms
light
airs
and
the
aid
of
the
carried
us
into
the
centre
of
roebuck
bay
where
we
came
to
an
anchor
in
fathoms
cape
villaret
bearing
south
by
west
west
about
miles
the
fall
of
the
tide
here
was
no
less
than
feet
as
we
closed
with
the
land
i
had
a
good
opportunity
of
speculating
upon
its
appearance
and
the
probability
of
our
investigation
confirming
or
contradicting
the
opinion
entertained
by
captains
king
and
dampier
that
a
channel
would
be
found
to
connect
roebuck
bay
with
an
opening
behind
buccaneers
archipelago
thus
making
dampier
land
an
island
i
confess
my
own
impressions
at
first
sight
differed
from
that
of
those
high
authorities
nor
did
a
nearer
examination
shake
my
opinion
cape
villaret
a
short
ridge
lying
east
and
west
and
about
feet
high
was
still
the
most
remarkable
object
the
sand
on
its
side
having
a
curious
red
appearance
from
the
masthead
the
land
was
not
visible
to
the
eastward
for
the
space
of
one
point
of
the
compass
yet
its
level
character
and
the
shoalness
of
the
water
led
alike
to
the
opinion
that
no
such
communication
as
supposed
would
be
found
to
exist
january
collecting
materials
for
the
chart
was
the
chief
occupation
of
the
day
usborne
discovered
a
inlet
in
the
south
shore
of
the
bay
five
miles
east
of
cape
villaret
having
a
dry
bank
of
sand
before
it
at
visit
from
the
natives
while
the
party
were
on
shore
they
were
visited
by
six
of
the
natives
a
larger
race
of
men
than
those
on
the
south
coast
naked
with
the
exception
of
a
grass
mat
round
the
waist
and
the
hair
straight
and
tied
up
behind
seemingly
ignorant
of
the
use
of
the
throwing
stick
but
carrying
spears
and
unbarbed
one
of
them
had
a
kiley
or
boomerang
and
each
carried
a
rude
hatchet
of
stone
none
of
them
had
suffered
the
loss
of
the
front
tooth
which
with
some
tribes
is
a
distinction
of
manhood
when
asked
by
signs
for
fresh
water
of
which
our
party
saw
no
traces
they
pointed
to
the
a
circumstance
which
i
record
as
it
may
possibly
be
of
some
service
to
future
explorers
as
the
boat
was
leaving
one
of
them
supposing
i
presume
that
they
were
out
of
our
reach
and
might
therefore
attack
us
with
impunity
threw
a
stone
at
the
boat
which
luckily
did
no
harm
though
hurled
with
great
dexterity
and
force
upon
this
a
pistol
was
discharged
over
their
heads
when
they
retired
with
far
greater
rapidity
than
they
had
advanced
an
almost
white
race
usborne
mentions
in
an
account
of
this
interview
published
in
the
nautical
magazine
for
page
that
one
of
the
party
differed
in
several
physical
characteristics
from
the
rest
after
describing
them
in
general
terms
as
being
from
five
feet
six
to
five
feet
nine
inches
tall
broad
shoulders
long
and
slight
legs
large
heads
and
overhanging
brows
he
continues
there
was
an
exception
in
the
youngest
who
appeared
of
an
entirely
different
race
his
skin
was
a
copper
colour
while
the
others
were
black
his
head
was
not
so
large
and
more
rounded
the
overhanging
brow
was
lost
the
shoulders
more
of
a
european
turn
and
the
body
and
legs
much
better
proportioned
in
fact
he
might
be
considered
a
man
at
our
standard
of
figure
a
similar
instance
of
meeting
with
one
of
a
tribe
not
apparently
belonging
to
the
same
subdivision
of
the
human
family
as
those
by
whom
he
was
surrounded
is
recorded
by
captain
grey
who
speaks
indeed
of
the
existence
of
a
distinct
race
totally
different
from
the
other
aborigines
and
almost
white
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
myself
encountered
any
of
these
almost
white
men
whose
existence
as
a
distinct
race
captain
grey
appears
to
have
rather
hastily
admitted
such
variation
in
form
and
colour
as
usborne
alludes
to
may
however
be
accounted
for
by
the
intercourse
which
the
natives
on
the
north
coast
hold
from
time
to
time
with
the
malays
several
very
large
black
martins
with
white
or
grey
heads
were
hovering
over
the
ship
this
morning
and
many
flights
of
small
white
tern
and
a
bird
commonly
called
the
passed
and
the
ship
every
morning
and
evening
flying
from
the
bay
to
seaward
and
returning
at
sunset
two
water
snakes
were
shot
alongside
the
ship
during
the
day
the
largest
measured
four
feet
and
was
of
a
dirty
yellow
colour
a
fish
was
taken
from
the
stomach
of
one
of
them
their
fangs
were
particularly
long
and
very
much
flattened
having
no
cutting
edge
whatever
some
turtle
also
passed
the
ship
and
a
day
or
two
afterwards
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
shoot
one
which
weighed
pounds
he
had
ample
justice
done
to
his
merits
it
was
at
and
the
stream
changed
at
the
same
time
a
circumstance
conclusively
demonstrating
that
we
were
not
anchored
in
a
strait
january
we
got
underweigh
in
the
morning
but
from
the
shallowness
of
the
water
anchored
within
a
mile
east
of
our
former
position
the
native
miago
the
native
miago
who
had
accompanied
us
from
swan
river
was
most
earnest
in
his
inquiries
about
the
savages
as
soon
as
he
understood
that
some
of
them
had
been
seen
he
appeared
delighted
that
these
blackfellows
as
he
calls
them
have
no
throwing
sticks
for
though
at
times
exceedingly
valiant
in
conversation
and
very
anxious
to
kill
one
of
the
men
and
carry
off
one
of
their
gins
or
wives
the
great
end
aim
and
ambition
of
all
australian
force
or
policy
he
yet
evidently
holds
these
northmen
in
great
dread
they
are
according
to
his
account
bad
men
eat
men
perth
men
tell
me
so
perth
men
say
miago
you
go
on
shore
very
little
plenty
quibra
go
you
go
these
instructions
appear
to
have
been
very
carefully
pressed
upon
him
by
his
associates
and
certainly
they
had
succeeded
in
inspiring
him
with
the
utmost
dread
of
this
division
of
his
fellow
countrymen
which
all
his
boasting
about
killing
some
of
them
and
taking
one
of
their
women
as
proof
of
his
prowess
back
to
perth
failed
to
concern
men
of
the
ship
clouds
of
magellan
he
gave
me
this
evening
a
new
reason
to
account
for
the
appearance
of
the
two
small
clouds
called
after
the
celebrated
magellan
in
the
following
words
you
see
said
he
pointing
up
to
the
sky
little
smoke
i
assented
at
once
for
certainly
the
clouds
have
very
much
the
appearance
of
that
to
which
he
compared
them
he
then
continued
perth
man
tell
me
long
long
time
back
he
make
fire
smoke
go
far
away
up
far
away
stop
and
never
go
away
more
miago
evidently
believed
that
his
friend
at
perth
had
really
lighted
the
fire
the
smoke
of
which
had
thus
gone
up
far
away
far
away
to
stop
and
never
go
away
more
i
can
easily
enough
comprehend
why
the
assertion
might
be
made
and
possibly
without
any
intention
to
deceive
upon
the
part
of
the
asserter
who
may
first
have
seen
the
clouds
after
watching
the
ascent
of
his
own
fire
smoke
through
the
still
air
in
the
same
direction
but
that
it
should
be
implicitly
believed
as
it
evidently
was
by
miago
upon
the
mere
word
of
his
fellow
countryman
did
i
own
astonish
me
and
seems
to
indicate
that
in
their
social
intercourse
with
each
other
they
may
have
more
regard
for
truth
than
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
give
them
credit
for
useless
bay
usborne
was
away
in
one
of
the
boats
seeking
a
berth
for
the
ship
higher
up
the
bay
upon
his
return
he
reported
that
he
had
been
over
the
banks
before
mentioned
upon
which
he
found
the
water
very
shoal
the
face
of
the
country
he
described
as
exceedingly
low
with
mud
lumps
not
unlike
scattered
here
and
there
over
the
face
of
it
and
several
clusters
of
small
trees
natives
also
had
been
seen
though
no
opportunity
of
approaching
them
had
occurred
as
the
moment
their
restless
eyes
or
quick
ears
detected
our
approach
they
most
rapidly
retreated
subsequent
experience
literally
verified
this
opinion
heat
and
sickness
january
two
boats
were
despatched
this
morning
under
usborne
command
to
examine
the
eastern
part
of
what
i
think
may
be
named
very
properly
useless
bay
this
would
have
been
my
duty
had
i
not
unfortunately
been
taken
ill
in
the
evening
of
the
preceding
day
the
symptoms
were
violent
headache
and
a
disordered
state
of
the
stomach
caused
the
surgeon
says
by
the
oppressive
and
overpowering
heat
which
we
have
experienced
for
the
last
few
days
and
the
general
effects
of
which
seem
more
distressing
to
the
ship
company
than
is
often
experienced
under
a
higher
range
of
the
thermometer
the
deprivation
of
all
power
or
energy
is
one
of
its
most
unpleasant
consequences
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
one
reason
for
its
great
and
wearying
effect
upon
most
of
us
indeed
more
or
less
all
are
suffering
from
it
is
that
there
is
hardly
any
variation
in
temperature
during
the
whole
hours
it
sometimes
does
not
amount
to
more
than
two
or
three
degrees
captain
wickham
and
the
surgeon
visited
an
inlet
near
the
ship
which
had
indeed
been
looked
into
but
not
explored
before
they
proceeded
to
the
for
about
three
miles
through
a
very
tortuous
channel
dry
in
many
parts
at
thickly
studded
with
mangrove
bushes
over
and
through
which
the
tide
made
its
way
at
giving
to
that
part
of
the
country
the
appearance
of
an
extensive
morass
a
slightly
elevated
range
of
land
was
seen
from
time
to
time
some
eight
or
nine
miles
to
the
but
in
its
highest
elevation
did
not
reach
feet
the
apparent
width
of
the
inlet
in
no
way
diminished
so
far
as
the
exploring
party
examined
it
and
this
fact
coupled
with
the
general
character
of
the
country
hereabouts
induces
me
to
suppose
that
the
periodical
return
of
the
spring
tide
floods
the
greater
part
of
the
coast
between
the
sea
shore
and
the
base
of
the
range
i
have
alluded
to
vampires
of
a
very
large
kind
were
here
met
with
the
furthest
south
we
had
seen
them
miago
on
shore
miago
had
accompanied
this
party
on
shore
though
he
evidently
showed
no
great
devotion
to
the
deed
they
said
he
watched
everything
aye
every
bush
with
the
most
scrutinizing
gaze
his
head
appeared
to
turn
upon
a
pivot
so
constantly
was
it
in
motion
with
all
that
restless
watchfulness
for
which
the
savage
is
ever
remarkable
the
heat
either
exceeded
an
average
or
else
perhaps
as
an
invalid
i
noticed
it
more
closely
on
shore
it
was
degrees
in
the
shade
on
board
it
was
degrees
in
the
shade
pulling
off
in
the
boats
during
the
day
it
fluctuated
between
and
a
breeze
from
seaward
blew
the
greater
part
of
each
night
from
hauling
round
to
south
in
the
morning
january
our
noon
observation
enabled
us
to
fix
the
latitude
of
cape
villaret
degrees
minutes
seconds
which
precisely
agrees
with
that
assigned
to
it
by
captain
king
usborne
wounded
in
the
afternoon
the
boats
returned
with
usborne
who
had
been
unfortunately
very
severely
wounded
by
the
accidental
discharge
of
a
musket
it
appeared
that
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
bay
which
ended
as
i
had
anticipated
in
proving
that
no
opening
to
the
interior
would
be
found
in
it
the
party
were
returning
to
the
boats
when
from
the
accidental
explosion
of
a
musket
in
the
hand
of
one
of
the
party
a
ball
entered
usborne
right
side
near
the
spine
between
the
lower
rib
and
hip
bone
making
an
exit
in
a
line
with
the
navel
this
truly
unfortunate
circumstance
which
for
some
weeks
deprived
the
expedition
of
the
services
of
a
most
valuable
officer
occurred
about
but
the
time
and
trouble
of
carrying
the
sufferer
through
the
mud
to
the
boats
and
then
pulling
some
miles
made
it
near
before
he
was
on
board
and
under
the
charge
of
bynoe
we
were
all
shocked
to
see
our
companion
lifted
apparently
lifeless
into
the
vessel
he
had
so
recently
quitted
full
of
health
and
animated
by
an
anxious
desire
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
conduce
to
the
general
success
but
were
ere
long
assured
by
bynoe
whose
personal
or
professional
merits
need
no
eulogium
from
me
and
who
immediately
and
most
carefully
attended
our
wounded
messmate
that
the
best
results
might
be
reasonably
hoped
for
a
prediction
shortly
afterwards
happily
verified
at
the
time
this
unlucky
accident
occurred
some
twenty
natives
rushed
from
the
concealment
whence
they
had
been
doubtless
watching
all
the
proceedings
of
the
party
as
though
they
designed
to
bear
a
part
in
what
probably
seemed
to
them
as
poor
usborne
went
down
an
approaching
fray
however
the
sight
of
the
two
boats
in
the
distance
which
upon
deploying
they
had
full
in
view
deterred
them
from
acting
upon
any
hostile
intentions
supposing
such
to
have
existed
in
their
minds
loaded
pistols
left
behind
the
accident
however
and
their
sudden
appearance
could
only
serve
additionally
to
flurry
the
little
party
who
had
to
convey
their
disabled
officer
to
a
place
of
safety
and
helpman
who
may
well
be
pardoned
the
want
of
his
usual
at
such
a
moment
left
behind
a
pair
of
loaded
pistols
they
would
puzzle
the
savages
greatly
of
course
but
i
hope
no
ill
consequences
ensued
if
they
began
pulling
them
about
or
put
them
in
the
fire
the
better
to
separate
the
wood
and
iron
two
or
three
poor
wretches
might
be
killed
or
maimed
for
life
and
their
first
recollections
of
the
quibra
men
as
miago
calls
us
would
naturally
be
anything
but
favourable
thus
disastrously
terminated
our
examination
of
roebuck
bay
in
which
the
cheering
reports
of
former
navigators
no
less
than
the
tenor
of
our
hydrographical
instructions
had
induced
us
to
anticipate
the
discovery
of
some
great
with
the
interior
of
this
vast
continent
a
most
thorough
and
careful
search
in
which
everyone
seemed
animated
by
one
common
and
universal
sentiment
prompting
all
to
a
zealous
discharge
of
duty
had
clearly
demonstrated
that
the
river
must
be
sought
elsewhere
and
that
very
fact
which
at
first
seemed
to
lessen
the
probabilities
of
ultimate
success
served
rather
to
inspire
than
to
daunt
since
while
it
could
not
shake
our
reliance
upon
the
opinions
of
those
best
qualified
to
decide
that
such
a
river
must
ultimately
be
discovered
it
only
narrowed
the
ground
upon
which
energy
knowledge
and
perseverance
had
yet
to
undergo
their
probation
ere
they
enjoyed
their
reward
the
our
intercourse
with
the
natives
had
been
necessarily
of
the
most
limited
character
hardly
amounting
to
anything
beyond
indulging
them
with
the
sight
of
a
new
people
whose
very
existence
notwithstanding
the
apathetic
indifference
with
which
they
regarded
us
must
have
appeared
a
prodigy
what
tradition
may
serve
to
hand
down
the
memory
of
our
visit
to
the
third
generation
should
no
newer
arrival
correct
its
gathering
errors
and
again
restore
some
vestige
of
the
truth
it
is
hardly
possible
to
imagine
but
should
any
misfortune
follow
their
possession
of
helpman
pistols
that
in
particular
will
be
narrated
as
the
motive
for
the
visit
of
those
white
men
who
came
flying
upon
the
water
and
left
some
of
the
secret
fire
upon
the
peaceful
coast
and
when
again
the
white
sails
of
the
explorer
glisten
in
the
distant
horizon
all
the
imaginary
terrors
of
the
will
be
invoked

satisfied
that

communication
could
be

from

bay
we
weighed
in
the
early
part
of
the
morning
and
stood
away
to
the
northward
appearance
of
the
country
roebuck
bay
so
named
to
commemorate
the
name
of
dampier
ship
is
about
sixteen
miles
across
the
southern
shores
are
low
and
extensive
sandbanks
and
mud
flats
are
bared
at
near
the
point
of
the
bottom
of
this
bay
is
a
curious
range
of
low
cliffs
from
twenty
to
thirty
feet
high
and
strongly
tinged
with
red
in
such
a
manner
as
to
suggest
that
they
must
be
highly
impregnated
with
oxide
of
iron
in
the
neighbourhood
of
these
cliffs
the
country
had
a
more
fertile
or
rather
a
less
desolate
appearance
stretching
out
into
extensive
plains
lightly
timbered
with
various
trees
of
the
genus
eucalypti
while
on
the
south
shore
of
the
bay
the
mangroves
were
numerous
towards
the
afternoon
we
discovered
a
small
inlet
being
then
about
miles
from
our
former
anchorage
in
roebuck
bay
we
steered
directly
for
it
and
when
within
half
a
mile
of
its
mouth
we
had
at
six
fathoms
from
the
masthead
i
could
trace
distinctly
the
course
of
this
inlet
which
at
this
state
of
the
tide
appeared
to
be
of
great
extent
but
the
bar
which
locked
its
mouth
and
over
which
the
sea
was
breaking
very
heavily
rendered
it
impossible
to
take
a
boat
across
without
evident
risk
by
which
no
real
good
would
be
obtained
as
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
tide
eighteen
feet
on
this
low
coast
was
more
than
sufficient
to
account
for
the
imposing
though
deceptive
appearance
of
this
opening
from
the
yard
i
was
enabled
to
take
an
almost
view
of
the
level
country
stretched
apparently
at
my
feet
the
shore
like
the
south
side
of
roebuck
bay
was
fringed
with
mangroves
while
to
the
lay
an
extensive
plain
over
which
the
water
seemed
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
to
flow
the
country
around
for
miles
wore
the
appearance
of
an
interminable
and
boundless
plain
with
an
almost
imperceptible
landward
elevation
and
thickly
wooded
with
stunted
trees
in
sailing
along
this
part
of
the
coast
we
found
several
inaccuracies
in
captain
king
chart
doubtless
owing
to
the
distant
view
with
which
he
was
compelled
to
content
himself
and
to
the
unfavourable
state
of
the
weather
against
which
he
had
to
contend
i
was
on
deck
nearly
indeed
the
whole
of
the
night
baffled
by
flying
clouds
in
my
attempts
to
fix
our
latitude
by
the
stars
at
length
however
i
succeeded
in
ascertaining
it
to
be
degrees
minutes
south
january
the
morning
was
fine
but
the
wind
we
had
experienced
the
preceding
night
caused
a
rather
heavy
swell
which
rendered
the
attempt
to
enter
this
inlet
an
impracticable
task
however
it
was
tried
we
found
between
the
ship
and
the
shore
six
four
and
two
fathoms
but
as
the
mouth
of
the
inlet
was
filled
with
breakers
apparently
on
a
bar
extending
out
half
a
mile
i
was
fully
convinced
that
further
perseverance
would
only
amount
to
waste
of
time
and
needless
risk
and
therefore
after
taking
a
few
angles
to
fix
the
position
of
the
boat
we
returned
on
board
it
appeared
at
to
be
nearly
dry
and
then
only
amounted
to
a
collection
of
mud
and
sandbanks
the
examination
quite
satisfied
me
that
it
partook
of
the
same
character
as
the
one
already
spoken
of
as
seen
yesterday
and
that
they
are
alike
useless
we
were
soon
underway
and
standing
towards
or
rather
along
the
shore
and
as
the
day
advanced
the
wind
drew
more
to
the
westward
a
common
occurrence
enabling
us
to
lay
along
the
shore
north
east
by
four
we
were
within
two
miles
of
it
in
nine
fathoms
the
coast
here
is
fronted
with
a
range
of
sandhills
some
of
which
are
topped
with
verdure
several
low
black
rocky
points
extend
for
some
distance
from
the
flat
sandy
beach
into
the
sea
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
this
is
a
kind
of
black
sandstone
often
found
at
the
bases
of
most
cliffy
points
and
probably
coloured
by
the
chemical
action
of
the
saltwater
the
sandhills
which
form
the
coastline
do
not
appear
to
extend
more
than
a
mile
inland
beyond
the
country
appeared
to
subside
into
the
same
dull
level
which
is
the
characteristic
feature
of
what
we
have
yet
seen
of
this
coast
thickly
studded
with
timber
of
a
much
finer
growth
than
the
stunted
productions
of
roebuck
bay
behind
the
cliffy
parts
of
the
coast
the
land
assumed
a
more
fertile
appearance
and
this
seemed
an
almost
invariable
law
in
the
natural
history
of
this
new
world
progress

five
miles
to
the
northward
of

we
passed
a

a
mile
from

with
seven
fathoms
one
mile
seaward
of
it
the
land
now
trended
to
the
eastward
and
formed
a
large
bay
the
south

of
which
we
rounded
at
half
past
four
the
mangroves
grew
right
down
to
the
water
edge
and
the
spring

appear
to
inundate
the
country
to
a
very
considerable
extent
the
land
here
being
lower
than
any
we
had
yet
seen
we
anchored
at
half
past
eight
in
six

i
ran

baudin

professional
courtesy
will
willingly
respect
it
is
however
only
right
to
mention
that
while
he
contented
himself
with
so
distant
a
view
of
this
part
of
australia
as
to
be
sometimes
completely
mistaken
in
the
most
important
particulars
to
the
celebrated
abel
tasman
belongs
the
merit
of
having
previously
landed
upon
its
shores
in
that
very
bay
which
now
bears
the
name
of
the
great
republican
description
of
the
natives
tasman
describes
the
natives
as
being
quite
naked
black
in
colour
and
having
curly
hair
malicious
and
cruel
using
for
arms
bows
and
arrows
and
kalawaeys
they
came
upon
one
occasion
fifty
in
number
to
attack
a
party
of
the
dutch
who
had
landed
but
took
fright
at
the
sight
and
sound
of
firearms
their
proas

adds
are
made
of
the
bark
of
trees
and
they
use
no
houses
hazeygaeys
are
synonymous
with
assagais
the
name
for
the
short
african
spear
used
by
the
tribes
between
port
natal
and
the
cape
and
which
is
generally
supposed
to
be
the
native
term
for
the
weapon
captain
harris
however
states
that
this
supposition
is
incorrect
and
certainly
its
appearance
and
termination
here
incline
me
to
join
him
in
suspecting
it
of
a
dutch
origin
such
is
the
account
of
this
distinguished
and
trustworthy
discoverer
upon
whose
veracity
i
should
be
the
last
to
attempt
to
affix
suspicion
his
very
simplicity
of
detail
and
the
entire
absence
of
rhetorical
artifice
would
convey
sufficient
internal
evidence
of
his
truth
had
not
the
subsequent
progress
of
australian
discovery
served
to
confirm
all
the
material
facts
of
his
narrative
i
may
however
remark
that
the
natives
seen
upon
this
coast
during
our
cruise
within
the
limits
of
roebuck
bay
to
the
south
and
port
george
the
fourth
to
the
north
an
extent
of
more
than
miles
with
the
exception
that
i
shall
presently
notice
agreed
in
having
a
common
character
of
form
feature
hair
and
physiognomy
which
i
may
thus
describe
the
average
height
of
the
males
may
be
taken
to
be
from
five
feet
five
inches
to
five
feet
nine
inches
though
upon
one
occasion
i
saw
one
who
exceeded
this
height
by
an
inch
they
are
almost
black
in
fact
for
ordinary
description
that
word
unqualified
by
the
adverb
serves
the
purpose
best
their
limbs
are
spare
and
light
but
the
muscle
is
finely
developed
in
the
superior
joint
of
the
arm
which
is
probably
owing
to
their
constant
use
of
it
in
throwing
the
spear
some
tribes
are
entirely
naked
while
others
wear
girdles
of
skin
and
leaves
hardly
sufficient
however
to
serve
any
purpose
of
decency
much
less
of
comfort
phrenological
development
their
hair
is
always
dark
sometimes
straight
and
sometimes
curled
and
not
unfrequently
tied
up
behind
but
we
saw
no
instance
of
a
negro
or
woolly
head
among
them
they
wear
the
beard
upon
the
chin
but
not
upon
the
upper
lip
and
allow
it
to
grow
to
such
a
length
as
enables
them
to
champ
and
chew
it
when
excited
by
rage
an
action
which
they
accompany
with
spitting
it
out
against
the
object
of
their
indignation
or
contempt
they
have
very
overhanging
brows
and
retreating
foreheads
large
noses
full
lips
and
wide
mouths
in
some
cases
they
want
the
two
foreteeth
in
the
upper
jaw
and
while
in
any
one
tribe
in
which
the
custom
prevails
it
seems
to
be
unanimous
it
does
not
appear
to
be
by
any
means
universally
diffused
along
the
whole
coast
the
unfavourable
impression
produced
by
the
prevailing
character
of
their
physiognomy
is
confirmed
if
their
phrenological
conformation
is
taken
into
consideration
and
certainly
if
the
principles
of
that
science
are
admitted
to
be
true
these
savages
are
woefully
deficient
in
all
the
qualities
which
contribute
to
man
moral
supremacy
let
me
in
justice
add
that
while
we
found
them
ignorant
and
incurious
to
the
last
degree
they
were
generally
suspicious
rather
than
treacherous
and
not
insensible
to
such
acts
of
kindness
as
they
could
comprehend
upon
all
this
extent
of
coast
we
saw
no
single
instance
of
the
use
or
even
existence
of
any
proa
or
canoe
and
my
own
opinion
strengthened
by
personal
experience
and
enforced
by
the
authority
of
the
most
recent
navigators
is
that
the
canoe
is
not
used
upon
the
coast
the
negative
evidence
at
least
is
strongly
in
favour
of
this
presumption
for
while
we
saw
the
canoe
in
use
in
clarence
strait
the
western
boundary
of
the
northern
coast
we
saw
nothing
but
the
raft
to
the
south
of
that
point
i
can
not
therefore
avoid
the
conclusion
that
misled
by
the
similarity
of
external
appearance
tasman
mistook
the
raft
of
unbarked
timber
for
a
bark
canoe
such
as
he
may
have
seen
upon
other
parts
of
the
coast
we
had
a
return
of
the
same
kind
of
squall
from
the
eastward
as
we
had
experienced
before
our
arrival
in
roebuck
bay
and
from
which
since
that
time
till
now
we
had
luckily
managed
to
escape
january
we
were
again
at
work
by
daylight
but
were
delayed
getting
clear
of
the
foul
ground
lying
off
cape
baskerville
on
which
we
twice
shoaled
the
water
to
three
and
five
fathoms
five
and
seven
miles
west
and
by
south
from
that
headland
beagle
bay
the
land
over
it
rises
to
an
elevation
of
nearly
feet
and
then
again
becomes
low
and
sandy
opening
out
a
bay
which
from
appearance
promised
and
wherein
we
afterwards
found
good
anchorage
it
was
named
beagle
bay
and
may
serve
hereafter
to
remind
the
seamen
who
benefit
by
the
survey
in
which
that
vessel
bore
so
conspicuous
a
part
of
the
amount
of
his
obligations
to
the
government
that
sent
her
forth
the
skill
and
energy
that
directed
her
course
and
the
patient
discipline
by
which
during
her
long
period
of
active
service
so
much
was
done
for
the
extension
of
our
maritime
knowledge
in
the
bight
formed
between
this
bay
and
cape
baskerville
we
passed
two
inlets
the
mouths
of
both
were
fronted
with
rocky
ledges
we
anchored
here
soon
after
midday
and
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
our
berth
beagle
bay
is
about
three
miles
broad
and
seven
deep
the
country
around
is
low
and
open
and
traces
of
water
deposit
were
visible
in
several
spots
to
indicate
its
dangerous
proximity
to
the
sea
the
smaller
shrubs
of
the
country
were
common
and
the
mangroves
flourished
in
great
abundance
on
the
beach
and
along
the
little
creeks
that
diverge
from
it
some
large
anthills
and
very
small
palm
trees
not
six
feet
in
height
were
noticed
for
the
first
time
so
far
south
during
the
night
the
wind
veered
round
to
and
blew
quite
fresh
a
circumstance
which
made
us
additionally
prize
our
good
anchorage
here
we
had
however
no
squall
nor
any
dew
which
i
should
mention
falls
most
copiously
upon
certain
nights
without
any
apparent
indication
to
these
dews
the
vegetation
of
this
country
so
far
as
we
can
judge
seems
to
owe
its
principal
nourishment
and
support
visited
by
natives
january
the
forenoon
was
devoted
to
the
examination
of
this
excellent
anchorage
and
a
party
was
also
despatched
to
haul
the
seine
on
landing
they
were
met
by
a
party
of
natives
who
saluted
them
in
a
manner
which
strikingly
resembled
the
eastern
mode
they
had
no
weapon
save
one
kiley
or
boomerang
and
bowed
down
until
they
almost
kissed
the
water
conduct
of
miago
their
speech
was
shrill
and
quick
perfectly
unintelligible
to
our
friend
miago
who
seemed
greatly
in
fear
of
them
they
seemed
astonished
to
find
one
apparently
of
their
own
clime
complexion
and
degree
in
company
with
the
white
strangers
who
must
have
seemed
to
them
a
different
race
of
beings
nor
was
their
wonder
at
all
abated
when
miago
threw
open
his
shirt
and
showed
them
his
breast
curiously
scarred
after
their
fashion
for
this
custom
of
cutting
stripes
upon
the
body
as
other
savages
tattoo
it
by
way
of
ornament
seems
universally
to
prevail
throughout
australia
as
a
convincing
evidence
that
he
though
now
the
associate
of
the
white
man
belonged
to
the
same
country
as
themselves
when
miago
had
in
some
degree
recovered
from
his
alarm
and
their
want
of
all
weapons
no
doubt
tended
to
reassure
him
more
than
anything
else
he
very
sagaciously
addressed
them
in
english
shaking
hands
and
saying
how
do
you
do
and
then
began
to
imitate
their
various
actions
and
mimic
their
language
and
so
perfectly
did
he
succeed
that
one
of
our
party
could
not
be
persuaded
but
that
he
really
understood
them
though
for
this
suspicion
i
am
convinced
there
was
in
truth
no
foundation
in
general
appearance
this
tribe
differed
but
little
from
those
we
had
previously
seen
they
wore
their
hair
straight
and
tied
behind
in
a
rude
semblance
of
the
modern
queue
their
beards
were
long
and
two
or
three
among
them
were
daubed
with
a
kind
of
black
ochre
all
of
them
had
lost
one
of
the
front
teeth
and
several
one
finger
joint
in
this
particular
they
differed
from
the
natives
seen
in
roebuck
bay
amongst
whom
the
practice
of
this
mutilation
did
not
prevail
they
were
i
think
travelling
to
the
southward
at
the
time
they
fell
in
with
us
for
they
had
no
females
among
the
party
by
whom
they
are
usually
at
other
times
accompanied
the
circumstance
of
their
being
unarmed
may
seem
to
militate
against
the
supposition
that
they
were
travelling
but
it
is
to
be
borne
in
mind
that
these
people
universally
consider
the
absence
of
offensive
weapons
as
the
surest
test
of
peaceful
intentions
and
would
therefore
if
they
desired
to
maintain
a
friendly
footing
with
the
newcomers
most
probably
deposit
their
arms
in
some
place
of
concealment
before
they
made
themselves
visible
a
similar
custom
was
noticed
by
captain
cook
at
the
sandwich
islands
where
it
was
regarded
as
a
propitiatory
sacrifice
to
the
eatooa
to
avert
his
anger
and
not
to
express
as
the
same
mutilation
does
in
the
friendly
islands
grief
for
the
loss
of
a
friend
native
smokes
the
coast
seems
pretty
thickly
populated
between
roebuck
and
beagle
bays
as
the
smoke
from
native
fires
was
constantly
to
be
seen
but
in
all
cases
these
signs
of
human
existence
were
confined
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sea
the
fishing
proved
unsuccessful
so
we
were
fain
to
content
ourselves
without
the
promised
addition
to
our
evening
meal
we
found
the
tide
rise
here
feet
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
another
anchorage
some
ten
miles
further
to
the
the
coast
along
which
we
sailed
within
the
distance
of
two
miles
was
chiefly
remarkable
for
its
tall
cliffs
with
here
and
there
a
small
sandy
bay
intervening
we
anchored
under
point
emeriau
so
named
by
captain
baudin
by
whom
it
was
mistaken
for
an
island
its
tall
white
cliffs
springing
from
and
guarded
by
a
base
and
ledges
of
black
rock
and
tinged
with
red
towards
their
summits
render
it
a
point
not
easily
to
be
mistaken
or
forgotten
by
any
who
have
once
seen
it
beyond
this
the
coast
curved
away
to
the
eastward
forming
a
bight
about
eleven
miles
in
length
january
leaving
our
anchorage
at
daylight
we
passed
the
north
point
of
the
bight
just
mentioned
soon
after
noon
it
is
a
low
black
rugged
cliffy
point
called
borda
by
the
french
having
a
much
more
appearance
than
would
have
been
anticipated
in
this
latitude
behind
it
the
country
rose
obliquely
the
horizon
terminating
in
an
inconsiderable
undulatory
and
elevation
cape
leveque
we
passed
another
bight
in
the
afternoon
the
shores
of
which
were
low
and
rocky
with
a
mangrove
creek
in
its
depth
from
this
bight
the
coast
becomes
almost
straight
the
line
being
hardly
broken
by
rocky
points
and
shallow
sandy
bays
to
cape
leveque
on
the
side
of
which
we
found
an
indifferent
anchorage
just
before
sunset
cape
leveque
is
a
red
cliffy
point
some
sixty
feet
in
height
with
an
islet
of
the
same
character
lying
close
off
it
the
latter
bore
from
our
anchorage
in
fathoms
south
degrees
west
miles
and
west
degrees
south
from
the
entrance
point
of
the
inviting
opening
we
were
now
about
to
explore
with
an
interest
rather
stimulated
than
decreased
by
the
want
of
success
that
attended
our
examination
of
roebuck
bay
point
swan
this
point
was
named
by
captain
king
point
swan
in
honour
of
captain
swan
of
the
cygnet
under
whom
dampier
first
discovered
it
and
was
an
appropriate
tribute
of
respect
and
admiration
from
one
distinguished
no
less
than
dampier
himself
by
the
possession
of
those
qualities
of
firmness
patience
judgment
and
perseverance
which
make
up
the
character
of
the
scientific
and
adventurous
navigator
to
him
by
whom
he
had
been
preceded
in
australian
discovery
the
country
between
point
swan
and
cape
leveque
has
a
very
sandy
and
barren
aspect
the
hillocks
near
the
latter
partook
of
its
prevailing
red
colour
january
we
proceeded
this
morning
in
the
direction
of
point
swan
and
remarked
as
we
approached
it
the
heavy
which
used
captain
king
so
roughly
and
which
subsequent
surveying
operations
enabled
us
to
account
for
from
great
irregularity
in
the
bottom
changing
almost
at
once
from
to
fathoms
we
waited
having
no
wish
to
experience
the
full
effect
of
the
current
for
slack
water
and
thus
passed
round
it
quietly
enough
we
anchored
in
a
small
bight
south
degrees
west
miles
from
point
swan
in
seven
fathoms
which
as
we
rightly
conjectured
would
leave
us
in
three
at
the
following
is
captain
king
graphic
account
of
his
encounter
with
this
race
on
my
way
towards
point
swan
we
saw
from
the
masthead
a
line
of
strong
tide
ripplings
extending
from
the
point
in
a
by
west
direction
within
which
we
at
first
attempted
to
pass
but
finding
they
were
connected
to
the
point
hauled
up
to
steer
through
them
where
they
seemed
to
be
the
least
dangerous
as
we
approached
the
noise
was
terrific
and
although
we
were
not
more
than
two
minutes
amongst
the
breakers
yet
the
shocks
of
the
sea
were
so
violent
as
to
make
us
fearful
for
the
safety
of
our
masts
a
smaller
vessel
would
perhaps
have
been
swamped
for
although
the
sea
was
in
other
parts
quite
smooth
and
the
wind
light
yet
the
water
broke
over
the
bows
and
strained
the
brig
considerably
as
we
had
now
arrived
at
the
point
from
which
we
anticipated
carrying
on
our
most
important
operations
it
became
of
paramount
interest
to
know
whether
we
could
rely
for
that
indispensable
article
fresh
water
upon
the
resources
of
the
wild
and
barbarous
shores
the
vast
extent
of
country
the
delightful
verdure
which
clothed
great
portions
of
it
nay
even
the
evidences
of
a
people
living
upon
its
shores
would
under
any
other
circumstances
and
on
any
other
coast
have
been
deemed
conclusively
to
decide
this
point
in
the
affirmative
but
the
voyager
knows
from
the
best
authority
that
upon
the
coasts
and
within
the
heart
of
australia
nature
seems
to
delight
in
contradiction
and
that
she
is
more
than
usually
capricious
with
respect
to
the
supply
of
what
is
ordinarily
her
most
common
as
it
is
ever
one
of
her
most
precious
gifts
a
few
wretched
might
serve
for
a
time
to
content
the
savages
trained
to
privation
from
their
earliest
infancy
but
for
ourselves
it
was
clear
either
that
a
reasonable
supply
of
fresh
water
must
be
found
here
or
we
must
not
calculate
upon
remaining
beyond
the
time
which
would
leave
us
sufficient
to
proceed
to
hanover
bay
where
this
most
needful
commodity
was
upon
the
authority
of
captain
king
to
be
found
search
for
water
no
sooner
therefore
was
the
beagle
properly
secured
in
her
new
berth
than
a
party
was
despatched
in
the
boats
to
commence
a
search
for
water
and
to
fix
upon
a
spot
for
carrying
on
the
necessary
observations
scarcely
however
had
we
pushed
off
from
alongside
before
the
white
ensign
at
our
main
warned
us
that
the
natives
were
in
sight
from
the
ship
and
on
turning
our
eyes
to
the
shore
we
beheld
it
thronged
with
savages
the
rapidity
of
whose
movements
as
they
shouted
in
apparent
defiance
brandishing
their
spears
and
whirling
their
arms
round
and
round
with
velocity
as
though
to
threaten
our
advance
rendered
it
impossible
to
estimate
their
number
with
any
confidence
but
they
were
evidently
in
considerable
force
however
we
pulled
to
the
shore
a
measure
against
which
the
valiant
miago
stoutly
protested
and
landed
in
a
position
not
directly
commanded
by
the
natives
they
made
no
attempt
to
prevent
us
but
anxious
to
avoid
hostilities
in
every
event
almost
equally
deplorable
we
deferred
any
distant
search
for
water
and
having
fixed
on
a
spot
for
our
temporary
observatory
returned
to
the
ship
this
signal
was
always
made
when
natives
were
seen
from
the
ship
if
any
parties
were
away
january
a
strong
party
was
sent
on
shore
early
this
morning
with
the
necessary
tools
for
digging
a
well
should
the
search
for
water
upon
the
surface
prove
abortive
it
was
at
once
found
that
this
operation
ought
forthwith
to
be
commenced
and
accordingly
a
promising
spot
was
selected
in
a
valley
not
half
a
mile
from
the
sea
the
natives
mustered
again
in
force
upon
the
heights
and
seemed
to
watch
our
proceedings
with
the
greatest
interest
we
saw
nothing
of
them
the
following
day
but
on
the
third
they
seemed
so
much
emboldened
by
our
inoffensive
proceedings
that
they
approached
so
near
as
to
keep
the
party
pretty
much
upon
the
alert
fire
a
congreve
rocket
it
was
therefore
determined
lest
familiarity
should
breed
contempt
to
give
them
a
hint
of
our
superiority
without
inflicting
any
injury
upon
their
persons
or
property
and
accordingly
shortly
after
dark
we
fired
a
congreve
rocket
from
the
ship
and
in
a
direction
immediately
over
their
presumed
position
this
had
the
desired
effect
and
our
operations
though
ultimately
unsuccessful
proceeded
without
further
annoyance
conduct
of
the
natives
two
or
three
days
afterwards
a
small
party
came
down
upon
the
beach
while
we
were
hauling
the
seine
and
tempted
by
the
offer
of
some
fish
for
an
australian
savage
is
easily
won
by
him
who
comes
with
things
that
do
show
so
fair
as
delicacies
in
the
gastronomic
department
they
approached
us
and
were
very
friendly
in
their
manner
though
they
cunningly
contrived
always
to
keep
the
upper
or
inland
side
of
the
beach
we
made
them
some
presents
of
beads
etc
from
the
stores
supplied
by
the
admiralty
for
that
purpose
but
they
received
them
with
an
indifference
almost
amounting
to
apathy
they
very
closely
examined
the
heroic
miago
who
submitted
to
be
handled
by
these
northern
men
with
a
very
rueful
countenance
and
afterwards
construed
the
way
in
which
one
of
them
had
gently
stroked
his
beard
into
an
attempt
to
take
him
by
the
throat
and
strangle
him
an
injury
and
indignity
which
when
safe
on
board
he
resented
by
repeated
threats
uttered
in
a
sort
of
wild
chant
of
spearing
their
thighs
backs
loins
and
indeed
each
individual
portion
of
the
frame
plague
of
flies
their
habit
of
keeping
the
eyes
almost
closed
and
the
head
thrown
back
in
order
to
avoid
the
plague
of
flies
under
which
this
country
seems
to
suffer
adds
to
the
unpleasant
expression
of
their
countenance
and
quite
justifies
the
correctness
of
dampier
account
their
eyelids
are
always
to
keep
the
flies
out
of
their
eyes
they
being
so
troublesome
here
that
no
fanning
will
keep
them
from
coming
to
face
and
without
the
assistance
of
both
hands
to
keep
them
off
they
will
creep
into
one
nostrils
and
mouth
too
if
the
lips
are
not
shut
very
close
so
that
from
their
infancy
being
thus
annoyed
with
these
insects
they
do
never
open
their
eyes
as
do
other
people
and
therefore
they
can
not
see
far
unless
they
hold
up
their
heads
as
if
they
were
looking
at
somewhat
over
them
we
found
constant
occasion
when
on
shore
to
complain
of
this
fly
nuisance
and
when
combined
with
their
allies
the
mosquitoes
no
human
endurance
could
with
any
patience
submit
to
the
trial
the
flies
are
at
you
all
day
crawling
into
your
eyes
up
your
nostrils
and
down
your
throat
with
the
most
irresistible
perseverance
and
no
sooner
do
they
from
sheer
exhaustion
or
the
loss
of
daylight
give
up
the
attack
than
they
are
relieved
by
the
musquitos
who
completely
exhaust
the
patience
which
their
predecessors
have
so
severely
tried
it
may
seem
absurd
to
my
readers
to
dwell
upon
such
a
subject
but
those
who
like
myself
have
been
and
to
boot
almost
stung
to
death
will
not
wonder
that
even
at
this
distance
of
time
and
place
i
recur
with
disgust
to
the
recollection
the
natives
in
all
parts
of
the
continent
alike
seem
to
possess
very
primitive
notions
upon
the
subject
of
habitation
their
most
comfortable
wigwams
hardly
deserve
the
name
not
even
in
the
neighbourhood
of
english
settlements
are
they
beginning
in
any
degree
to
imitate
our
european
notions
of
comfort
among
these
northern
people
the
only
approach
to
anything
like
protection
from
the
skiey
influences
that
i
could
discover
was
a
slight
rudely
thatched
covering
placed
on
four
upright
poles
between
three
and
four
feet
high
another
of
a
much
superior
description
which
i
visited
on
the
western
shore
of
king
sound
will
be
found
delineated
in
that
part
of
my
journal
to
which
the
narrative
belongs
wind
and
weather
february
we
remained
at
this
anchorage
until
the
of
february
in
consequence
of
a
continuance
of
bad
weather
indeed
the
rain
during
the
three
first
days
of
that
month
was
at
times
of
the
most
character
while
the
wind
constantly
blowing
very
fresh
kept
veering
from
to
every
now
and
then
by
way
of
agreeable
variety
a
heavy
squall
would
take
us
from
though
more
commonly
from
the
only
certainty
that
we
could
calculate
upon
was
that
at
the
wind
would
remain
when
it
got
there
stationary
for
a
few
hours
the
thunder
and
lightning
the
former
loud
and
with
a
long
reverberating
peal
and
the
latter
of
the
most
intensely
vivid
kind
were
constantly
roaring
and
flashing
over
our
heads
and
with
the
stormy
echoes
which
the
rolling
deep
around
woke
on
these
unknown
and
inhospitable
shores
completed
a
scene
that
i
shall
never
cease
to
remember
as
i
never
then
beheld
it
without
mingled
emotions
of
apprehension
and
delight
the
rain
however
certainly
befriended
us
in
more
ways
than
one
it
cooled
the
atmosphere
which
would
else
have
been
insufferably
hot
diminished
for
a
time
the
number
and
virulence
of
our
winged
tormentors
and
recruited
our
stock
of
fresh
water
for
though
ultimately
we
were
not
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
it
as
a
beverage
it
did
exceedingly
well
for
washing
purposes
we
had
also
during
this
time
one
most
successful
haul
with
the
seine
which
amply
supplied
us
with
fresh
fish
for
that
and
the
two
following
days

tidal
phenomenon
on
the
same
day
we
remarked
owing
to
the
wind
a
singular
phenomenon
in
the
tides
here
from
to
the
stream
wholly
ceased
and
the
water
being
heaped
up
in
the
bay
by
the
force
of
the
wind
fell
only
sixteen
instead
of
feet
several
sporting
excursions
were
made
during
this
period
but
with
comparatively
little
success
it
is
not
a
country
naturally
very
abundant
in
game
of
any
kind
except
kangaroos
which
are
numerous
but
so
harassed
by
the
natives
as
to
be
of
course
extremely
shy
of
the
approach
of
man
singular
kangaroo
however
bynoe
succeeded
in
shooting
one
which
possessed
the
singular
appendage
of
a
nail
like
that
on
a
man
little
finger
attached
to
the
tail
i
regret
that
we
had
no
subsequent
opportunity
to
decide
whether
this
was
one
of
a
new
species
of
the
macropodidae
family
or
a
mere
lusus
naturae
the
dimensions
and
height
of
this
singular
animal
were
as
follows
length
of
body
from
tip
of
nose
inches
length
of
tail
from
stump
to
tip
inches
weight
pounds
this
animal
has
been
classed
by
gould
as
macropus
unguifer
and
is
now
deposited
in
the
british
museum
one
precisely
similar
was
afterwards
killed
on
the
east
coast
of
the
gulf
of
carpentaria
we
also
saw
some
very
large
red
or
kangaroos
but
never
got
near
enough
to
secure
one
they
were
apparently
identical
with
a
new
race
of
which
i
afterwards
procured
a
specimen
at
barrow
island
osphranter
isabellinus
gould
one
day
when
i
had
penetrated
some
considerable
distance
into
the
bush
farther
indeed
than
any
of
our
party
had
strayed
before
i
saw
a
large
bustard
but
was
unable
to
get
a
shot
at
him
his
anxious
and
acute
gaze
had
detected
me
at
the
same
moment
that
i
had
discovered
him
and
he
was
off
i
thought
at
the
time
that
he
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
wild
turkey
of
the
colonists
in
the
southern
parts
of
the
continent
we
were
lucky
enough
to
shoot
several
quails
of
apparently
quite
a
new
species
in
one
particular
they
differed
from
the
members
of
the
genus
coturnis
in
having
no
hind
toe
goannas
and
lizards
were
plentiful
in
this
neighbourhood
and
some
of
the
latter
in
particular
were
most
brilliant
in
colour
they
ran
down
the
tall
trees
in
which
they
seem
to
pass
a
great
portion
of
their
lives
at
our
approach
with
a
most
marvellous
rapidity
and
darting
along
the
ground
were
soon
in
safety
anthills
but
what
perhaps
most
attracted
our
attention
was
the
very
surprising
size
of
the
anthills
or
nests
i
measured
one
the
height
of
which
was
feet
and
width
at
the
base
feet
from
whence
it
tapered
gradually
to
the
apex
they
are
composed
of
a
pale
red
earth
but
how
it
is
sufficiently
tempered
i
am
unable
to
state
certain
is
it
that
it
has
almost
the
consistence
of
mortar
and
will
bear
the
tread
of
a
man
upon
the
top
fish
the
fishing
over
the
ship
side
was
not
less
successful
than
hauling
the
seine
though
quite
a
different
kind
of
fish
was
taken
to
reward
the
labour
of
the
saltwater
waltonians
who
devoted
themselves
to
it
they
generally
secured
at
slack
water
a
large
fish
in
shape
like
a
bream
and
with
long
projecting
teeth
february
we
made
up
a
party
on
the
for
the
purpose
of
penetrating
a
little
way
into
the
interior
and
got
seven
miles
from
the
sea
in
a
south
by
west
direction
everything
wore
a
green
and
most
delightful
appearance
but
the
reader
must
bear
in
mind
how
vegetation
had
just
been
forced
by
heavy
rains
upon
a
light
heated
soil
and
also
recollect
that
to
one
who
has
been
pent
up
for
some
time
on
board
ship
a
very
barren
prospect
may
seem
delightful
native
fires
the
country
was
more
open
in
character
than
i
had
before
noticed
it
and
the
numerous
traces
of
native
fires
which
we
found
in
the
course
of
the
excursion
seemed
readily
to
account
for
this
indeed
during
dry
seasons
it
not
unfrequently
happens
that
an
immense
tract
of
land
is
desolated
with
fire
communicated
either
by
the
design
or
carelessness
of
the
natives
to
the
dry
herbage
on
the
surface
the
moment
the
flame
has
been
kindled
it
only
waits
for
the
first
breath
of
air
to
spread
it
far
and
wide
then
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
the
fiery
tempest
streams
over
the
hillsides
and
through
the
vast
plains
and
prairies
bushwood
and
herbage
the
dry
grass
the
tall
reed
the
twining
parasite
or
the
giant
of
the
forest
charred
and
blackened
but
still
proudly
erect
alike
attest
and
bewail
the
conquering
fire
onward
march
and
the
bleak
desert
silent
waste
and
lifeless
which
it
leaves
behind
seems
forever
doomed
to
desolation
vain
fear
the
rain
descends
once
more
upon
the
dry
and
thirsty
soil
and
from
that
very
hour
which
seemed
the
date
of
cureless
ruin
nature
puts
forth
her
wondrous
power
with
increased
effort
and
again
her
green
and
mantle
decks
the
earth
with
a
new
beauty
soil
and
productions
the
soil
of
the
extensive
plain
over
which
we
journeyed
this
day
was
light
and
sandy
in
character
but
the
large
amount
of
vegetable
matter
which
it
contains
and
the
effect
of
the
late
rains
which
had
penetrated
some
or
inches
into
it
made
us
perhaps
somewhat
overvalue
its
real
merits
this
plain
rose
gradually
before
us
until
it
reached
an
elevation
of
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
was
covered
with
a
long
thin
grass
through
which
the
startled
kangaroo
made
off
every
now
and
then
at
a
killing
pace
the
face
of
the
country
was
well
but
not
too
closely
covered
with
specimens
of
the
red
and
white
gum
and
paperbark
tree
and
several
others
the
timber
was
but
small
the
diameter
of
the
largest
a
red
gum
inches
ever
and
anon
the
sparkling
brilliant
lizards
darted
down
from
their
resting
places
among
the
boughs
so
rapid
in
their
fearful
escape
that
they
caught
the
eye
more
like
a
flash
of
momentary
light
than
living
moving
forms
we
flushed
in
the
course
of
the
day
a
white
bird
or
at
least
nearly
so
with
a
black
ring
round
the
neck
and
a
bill
crooked
like
the
ibis
which
bird
indeed
except
in
colour
it
more
resembles
than
any
i
have
ever
seen
since
ascertained
to
be
an
ibis
the
threskiornis
strictipennis
among
the
trees
seen
in
the
course
of
this
ramble
i
had
almost
forgotten
to
mention
one
which
struck
me
more
than
any
other
from
its
resemblance
to
a
kind
of
cotton
tree
used
by
the
natives
of
the
south
sea
islands
in
building
their
canoes
february
the
day
following
we
secured
several
of
rainwater
deposited
in
the
holes
of
the
rocks
near
our
temporary
observatory
and
were
the
better
pleased
with
our
success
as
our
had
proved
unsuccessful
geology
of
the
cliffs
there
was
something
particularly
striking
in
the
geological
formation
of
the
cliffs
that
form
the
western
side
of
this
bay
and
which
rise
from
to
feet
in
height
their
bases
apparently
resting
amid
huge
and
irregular
masses
of
the
same
white
sandstone
as
that
which
forms
the
cliffs
themselves
and
from
which
this
massive
debris
strewn
in
all
conceivable
irregularity
and
confusion
around
appears
to
have
been
violently
separated
by
some
great
internal
convulsion
some
of
these
great
masses
both
of
the
living
cliff
and
ruined
blocks
beneath
are
strangely
pierced
with
a
vein
or
tube
of
vitreous
matter
not
less
in
some
instances
than
inches
in
diameter
in
every
place
the
spot
at
which
this
tube
entered
the
rock
was
indicated
by
a
considerable
extent
of
glazed
or
smelted
surface
but
i
am
not
sufficiently
versed
in
the
science
of
geology
to
offer
any
specific
theory
to
account
for
the
appearances
i
have
described
the
cliffs
were
rent
and
cracked
in
a
thousand
different
ways
and
taking
into
consideration
their
strange
and
wrecked
appearance
together
with
the
fact
that
lightning
is
known
to
vitrify
sand
may
we
not
thus
get
a
clue
to
the
real
agency
by
which
these
results
have
been
produced
since
this
was
written
i
have
consulted
my
friend
darwin
who
has
kindly
examined
a
specimen
i
brought
away
he
pronounces
it
a
superficial
highly
ferrugineous
sandstone
with
concretionary
veins
and
aggregations
the
reader
should
however
consult
darwin

february
the
weather
was
thick
and
gloomy
and
it
rained
fast
but
having
completed
our
survey
and
observations
and
the
wind
being
favourable
it
was
resolved
to

further
loss

act

of
which
though
we
had
sounded
the

we
had
been
till
that
moment
in
ignorance
he
only
who
has
felt
the
almost
animated
shudder
that
runs
through
the
seemingly
doomed
ship
at
that
fearful
moment
can
understand
with
what
gratitude
we
hailed
our
escape
from
the
treacherous
foe
in
passing
out
we
named
two
low
small
rocky
islands
lying
north
of
point

and
hitherto
unhonoured
with
any
particular
denomination

it
should
be
noted
that
the
tide
did
not
begin
to
make
to
the
southward
till
hours
minutes
being
full
half
an
hour
after
by
the
shore
we
passed
through
several
tide
races
not
however
feeling
their
full
force
owing
to
our
encountering
them
at
the
time
of
slack
water
in
every
case
our
soundings
indicated
great
irregularity
of
bottom
the
cause
to
which
i
have
already
assigned
these
impediments

sunday
strait
we
found
a
temporary
anchorage
the
same
morning
on
the
east
side
of
the
large
group
forming
the
eastern
side
of
sunday
strait
so
named
by
captain
king
who
was
drifted
in
and
out
of
it
on
that
day
august
amid
an
accumulation
of
perils
that
will
long
render
the
first
navigation
of
this
dangerous
archipelago
a
memorable
event
in
the
annals
of
nautical
hardihood
roe
group
this
group
we
called
after
lieutenant
roe
of
western
australia
who
had
accompanied
captain
king
in
that
perilous
voyage
and
whose
valuable
information
had
enabled
us
to
escape
so
many
of
the
dangers
to
which
our
predecessors
had
been
exposed
nothing
could
exceed
the
desolate
appearance
of
the
land
near
which
we
were
now
lying
rocks
of
a
primitive
character
massed
together
in
all
the
variety
of
an
irregularity
that
rather
reminded
the
beholder
of
nature
ruin
than
her
grandeur
rose
drear
and
desolate
above
the
surrounding
waters
no
trees
shaded
their
riven
sides
but
the
mangrove
clothed
the
base
of
this
sterile
island
and
a
coarse
wiry
grass
was
thinly
spread
over
its
sides
miago
and
his
friends
soon
after
we
had
anchored
some
natives
were
observed
by
miago
watching
us
from
the
shore
and
shortly
afterwards
a
party
landed
to
attempt
communicating
with
them
and
to
get
the
necessary
observations
for
the
survey
in
the
first
object
they
failed
altogether
for
these
blackfellows
as
that
gallant
hero
called
them
retired
to
the
heights
and
while
closely
watching
every
movement
refused
to
trust
themselves
within
our
reach
the
smallness
of
their
number
and
their
want
of
arms
quite
elevated
the
courage
of
miago
who
loudly
vaunted
his
intention
of
monopolizing
a
northern
gin
in
order
to
astonish
his
friends
upon
our
return
to
the
south
stealing
away
the
ladies
being
as
i
have
before
remarked
the
crowning
and
most
honourable
achievement
of
which
man
in
the
eyes
of
these
savages
is
capable
i
ought
not
to
omit
remarking
here
that
the
natives
seen
were
accompanied
by
a
black
dog
the
only
instance
in
which
before
or
since
we
observed
the
existence
of
a
dog
of
that
colour
in
this
vast
country
captain
king
mentions
that
he
saw
one
in
this
neighbourhood
during
his
visit
in
day
of
rest
the
following
day
was
sunday
and
there
being
no
absolute
necessity
to
shift
our
berth
we
remained
at
anchor
marking
the
character
of
this
sacred
festival
by
giving
it
up
to
the
crew
for
healthful
rest
and
harmless
recreation
after
morning
prayers
had
been
performed
as
much
as
the
needful
discipline
upon
a
proper
observance
of
which
the
efficiency
of
a
ship
company
entirely
depends
would
allow
this
practice
constantly
observed
throughout
our
long
voyage
was
always
attended
with
the
best
results
some
rather
small
pigeons
of
a
dark
brown
colour
marked
with
a
white
patch
on
the
wings
were
seen
and
some
specimens
shot
they
made
a
whirring
sound
in
flight
like
the
partridge
and
appeared
to
haunt
the
rocks
a
habit
which
all
subsequent
observation
confirmed

february
soon
after
daylight
we
left
this
anchorage
whose
exact
position
i
mention
as
it
may
be
of
use
to
some
future
voyager
in
these
seas
the
eastern
of
the
three
islands
north
of
roe
group
was
just
open
of
the
north
point
of
the
bight
in
which
we
lay
and
a
small
rocky
islet
close
to
the
shore
bore
one
mile
we
had
five
fathoms
at
in
the
bight
and
twelve
immediately
outside
after
making
a
stretch
to
the
southward
for
about
five
miles
in
soundings
varying
from
to
fathoms
we
again
closed
with
the
shore
and
anchored
in
five
fathoms
on
the
south
side
of
roe
group
three
miles
from
our
former
anchorage
a
party
landed
in
the
afternoon
to
procure
the
requisite
observations
the
country
was
not
quite
so
sterile
nor
its
face
of
so
rugged
a
character
native
raft
we
found
nothing
worth
particular
attention
except
a
native
raft
the
first
we
had
yet
seen
it
was
formed
of
nine
small
poles
pegged
together
and
measured
ten
feet
in
length
by
four
in
breadth
the
greatest
diameter
of
the
largest
pole
was
three
inches
all
the
poles
were
of
the
palm
tree
a
wood
so
light
that
one
man
could
carry
the
whole
affair
with
the
greatest
ease
by
it
there
was
a
very
rude
paddle
from
a
distant
station
i
looked
upon
the
dangerous
and
rapid
current
which
divides
two
rocky
islands
and
the
perils
of
which
are
fearfully
increased
by
the
presence
of
an
insulated
rock
in
its
centre
past
which
its
fury
only
heightened
by
the
opposition
the
torrent
hurries
with
accelerated
force
captain
king
and
the
bathurst
it
was
by
this
fearful
passage
that
captain
king
entered
this
part
of
the
sound
drifting
towards
apparently
instant
destruction
without
a
breath
of
wind
to
afford
him
even
a
chance
of
steering
between
the
various
perils
that
environed
his
devoted
ship
as
the
bathurst
swept
past
the
neighbouring
shores
covered
with
the
strange
forms
of
the
howling
savages
who
seemed
to
anticipate
her
destruction
and
absolutely
within
the
range
of
their
spears
drifting
with
literally
giddy
rapidity
towards
the
fatal
rocks
what
varied
thoughts
must
have
flashed
crowding
an
age
within
an
hour
upon
the
mind
of
her
commander
it
seemed
that
all
evidence
of
what
his
own
perseverance
the
devotion
of
his
officers
and
the
gallantry
of
his
crew
had
accomplished
for
the
honour
of
their
common
country
would
in
a
few
brief
moments
be
the
prey
of
the
rapid
the
spoil
of
the
deep
and
yet
while
many
a
heart
sent
up
its
voiceless
prayer
to
him
whose
arm
is
not
shortened
that
it
can
not
save
believing
that
prayer
to
be
their
last
not
a
cheek
blanched
not
an
eye
quailed
but
the
of
omnipotent
mercy
rested
even
upon
that
solitary
ship
and
within
a
few
yards
of
the
fatal
rock
one
momentary
breath
of
wind
proved
his
providential
care
for
those
from
whom
all
hope
had
fled
i
shuddered
as
the
events
captain
king
has
recorded
rose
up
in
palpable
distinctness
to
my
view
and
afterwards
in
memory
of
that
day
called
the
channel
escape
to
the
sound
itself
we
gave
the
name
of
king
in
the
full
confidence
that
all
for
whom
the
remembrance
of
skill
and

february
it
blew
a
violent
gale
the
whole
of
this
day
from
coming
on
quite
unexpectedly
for
neither
the
state
nor
appearance
of
the

gave
us
the
least
indication
of
its
approach
exposed
on
a
it
may
be
imagined
that
we
were
by
no
means
displeased
to
see
it
as
rapidly
and
inexplicably
depart
as
it
had
suddenly
and
mysteriously
appeared
point
cunningham
february
leaving
this
anchorage
we
found
another
in
a
bay
on
the
mainland
miles
south
from
point
swan
and
from
a
remarkable
headland
named
by
captain
king
point
cunningham
in
honour
of
that
distinguished
botanist
whose
zealous
exertions
have
added
so
much
to
the
flora
of
australia
i
well
remember
when
we
were
preparing
to
sail
from
sydney
in
may
the
scientific
veteran
seemed
to
enter
with
the
utmost
interest
into
all
the
details
of
the
coming
adventure
and
even
though
the
natural
force
of
that
frame
which
had
so
often
set
danger
at
defiance
while
engaged
in
the
ennobling
pursuits
to
which
his
honourable
career
had
been
devoted
was
too
palpably
failing
the
mind
whose
dictates
it
had
so
long
obeyed
the
fire
of
the
spirit
that
had
burned
throughout
so
brightly
seemed
to
leap
up
in
yet
more
glowing
flame
ere
quenched
forever
by
the
ashes
of
the
grave
alas
within
the
brief
period
of
two
months
the
world
had
closed
upon
him
for
ever
successful
search
for
water
a
point
fronting
a
small
islet
almost
joined
to
it
at
was
selected
as
a
fitting
spot
for
the
commencement
of
our
operations
which
we
hoped
to
bring
to
a
more
successful
termination
than
our
former
attempt
at
point
swan
after
sinking
to
a
depth
of
eight
feet
our
anticipations
were
fully
justified
the
water
flowing
in
through
the
sides
in
great
abundance
it
was
quite
fresh
and
in
every
way
most
acceptable
to
us
all
but
tinged
as
it
was
with
the
red
colour
of
the
surrounding
soil
we
could
at
once
perceive
that
it
was
only
surface
water
as
we
watched
it
filling
our
neatly
excavated
well
we
found
no
great
difficulty
in
understanding
why
in
this
continent
a
native
speaks
of
any
very
favoured
district
as
very
fine
country
much
plenty
water
fine
country
thus
comprehending
in
the
certain
supply
of
that
one
necessary
of
life
the
chief
nay
almost
the
sole
condition
essential
to
a
happy
land
skeleton
point
we
named
this
skeleton
point
from
our
finding
here
the
remains
of
a
native
placed
in
a
position
under
a
wide
spreading
gum
tree
enveloped
or
more
properly
shrouded
in
the
bark
of
the
papyrus
all
the
bones
were
closely
packed
together
the
larger
being
placed
outside
and
the
general
mass
surmounted
by
the
head
resting
on
its
base
the
fleshless
eyeless
skull
grinning
horribly
over
the
right
side
some
of
the
natives
arrived
shortly
after
we
had
discovered
this
curious
specimen
of
their
mode
of
sepulture
but
although
they
entertain
peculiar
opinions
upon
the
especial
sanctity
of
the
house
appointed
for
all
living
a
sanctity
we
certainly
were
not
altogether
justified
in
disregarding
they
made
no
offer
of
remonstrance
at
the
removal
of
the
mortal
remains
of
their
dead
brother
whether
here
as
in
the
neighbourhood
of
fremantle
they
regarded
us
as
near
kindred
of
their
own
under
a
new
guise
and
so
perhaps
might
suppose
that
we
took
away
the
dry
bones
in
order
to
rebuild
the
frame
of
which
they
before
formed
the
support
and
to
clothe
the
hideous
nakedness
of
death
with
the
white
man
flesh
or
whether
deeming
us
indeed
profane
violators
of
that
last
of
suffering
humanity
which
it
seems
an
almost
instinctive
feeling
to
regard
with
reverence
they
left
the
office
of
retribution
either
to
the
spirit
of
the
departed
or
the
more
potent
to
be
found
upon
the
testimony
of
miago
in
the
wicked
north
i
know
not
certain
it
is
that
under
the
superintendence
of
bynoe
the
removal
was
effected
and
that
the
skeleton
itself
presented
by
that
officer
to
captain
grey
was
by
him
bestowed
upon
the
royal
college
of
surgeons
in
whose
museum
it
is
now
to
be
found
among
the
ornithological
specimens
obtained
here
was
one
of
the
curlew
tribe
greatly
resembling
an
ibis
and
remarkable
for
its
size
it
measured
from
the
extremity
of
the
bill
to
the
tip
of
the
toe
inches
and
weighed
pound
ounces
the
colour
with
the
exception
of
the
belly
and
legs
which
were
of
a
dirty
white
slightly
mottled
very
much
resembled
that
of
the
common
english
wild
duck
kileys
one
of
the
natives
seen
had
with
him
a
kiley
so
different
in
shape
to
any
we
had
previously
seen
that
i
preserved
a
sketch
of
it
all
the
party
wore
their
hair
tied
up
behind
and
each
had
suffered
the
loss
of
one
of
the
front
teeth
in
the
upper
jaw
and
some
had
endured
an
extraordinary
mutilation
apparently
in
exaggeration
of
an
ancient
jewish
rite
in
general
appearance
they
resembled
the
natives
previously
seen
at
point
swan
our
parting
legacy
they
appeared
to
luxuriate
in
the
water
we
had
found
wondered
at
the
size
of
our
well
and
expressed
the
greatest
admiration
of
our
skill
in
thus
procuring
this
needful
article
and
i
do
not
doubt
but
that
long
after
every
other
recollection
of
our
visit
shall
have
passed
away
this
beneficial
memorial
of
it

perpetuate

advantage
finally
driving
me

every
indignity

spoke

even
could
such
a

of
patient
endurance
be
found
i
am
sure
it
would
fail
him
when
exposed
to
the
ceaseless
persecution
of
these
inexorable
assailants
february
the
greater
part
of
was
spent
in
making
a
more
minute
examination
of
the

shoal
discovered
yesterday
rendering
a
more
careful
search
necessary
from

very
broken

rugged
it
appeared
to
be
to
the
and
south
i
could
see
no

a
circumstance
which
raised
my
hopes
of
finding
in
that
direction
the
long
and
anxiously
expected
river
which
the
geological
formation
of
the
country
and
all
the
recorded
experience
of
discovery
alike
warranted
us
in
anticipating
the
point
upon
which
i
stood

a
steep

cliffy

facing
the

with
the

singular

projecting

we
searched
in

for
the
fresh
water
which
that
distinguished
navigator
speaks
of
as
having
been
found
there
by
him
in
singular

remarked
here
certain
vitreous
formations
in
all
except

identical
with
those
already
described

just
see

a

interesting
nay
a

exciting

of

to
commence

it
was
reserved
for
us

take
up
the
thread

and
scientific
predecessor

the
moment

within

it
was
forthwith
determined
that

should
collect
the
necessary
materials
for
completing
the
survey
and
preparing
the
chart
of

immediate
neighbourhood
of

while
to
myself
the
whale
boat
and

were
to
be
entrusted
nor
can
i
describe
with
what
delight
all
minor
annoyances
forgotten
i
prepared
to
enter
upon
the
exciting
task
of
exploring
waters
unfurrowed
by
any
preceding
keel
and
shores
on
which
the
advancing
step
of
civilization
had
not
yet
thrown
the
shadows
of
her
advent
nor
the
voice
of
that
christianity
which
walks
by
her
side
through
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
summoned
the
wilderness
and
the
desert
to
hail
the
approaching
hour
in
the
fulness
of
which
all
the
earth
shall
be
blessed
soon
after
dark
we
were
visited
by
a
squall
from
the
eastward
longer
in
duration
and
heavier
than
any
we
had
before
experienced
from
our
exposed
situation
no
land
intervening
for
miles
it
raised
a
good
deal
of
sea
the
wind
remained
fresh
at
the
east
during
the
greater
part
of
the
night
february
the
morning
broke
dark
gloomy
and
threatening
but
as
the
day
advanced
it
gradually
assumed
its
usual
bright
and
brilliant
character
and
at
seven
we
started
helpman
having
the
whaleboat
while
tarrant
accompanied
me
in
the
yawl
we
crossed
disaster
bay
in
four
and
five
fathoms
steering
in
the
direction
of
valentine
island
and
inside
a
long
sandy
spit
partly
dry
at
and
extending
of
the
way
across
freshwater
lake
while
waiting
for
the
tide
to
rise
in
order
to
cross
this
natural
breakwater
we
landed
and
struggled
for
a
good
mile
through
a
mixture
of
deep
mud
and
sand
drifted
at
the
coastline
into
hills
of
from
to
thirty
feet
high
and
bound
together
by
a
long
coarse
grass
immediately
beyond
which
we
came
upon
a
small
lake
of
fresh
water
where
all
the
luxuriant
growth
of
tropical
vegetation
was
starting
into
life
and
presenting
an
almost
miraculous
contrast
to
the
barren
sterility
that
stamped
an
aspect
of
changeless
desolation
upon
the
rest
of
this
inhospitable
shore
indeed
so
far
as
our
experience
extended
upon
the
coasts
and
within
the
interior
of
this
in
many
respects
extraordinary
continent
the
want
of
water
appears
to
be
the
chief
drawback
to
the
fertility
otherwise
to
be
anticipated
from
its
geographical
position
at
the
same
time
it
is
quite
impossible
to
blind
oneself
to
the
fact
that
further
researches
on
the
one
hand
and
the
application
of
the
great
discoveries
in
hydraulics
of
which
recent
years
have
been
so
fruitful
on
the
other
may
and
probably
will
spread
the
vernal
bloom
of
cultivation
over
wastes
now
condemned
to
prolonged
and
arbitrary
periods
of
drought
this
spot
which
long
arrested
my
attention
and
upon
which
i
gazed
with
the
selfish
feeling
of
delight
inspired
by
the
thought
that
thereon
never
before
had
rested
the
curious
eye
of
any
restless
and
indefatigable
wanderer
from
the
west
is
distant
about
yards
from
a
solitary
patch
of
low

cliffs
the
first

this

present

to
the
southward
almost
connect
it
at
with

we
reached
at
two
just
on
the
top
of
and
shortly
afterwards
grounded
the
boats
in
a
small
bay
to
the
westward
the
greatest
extent
of
valentine
island
is
of
a

in

by
south
direction
either
extremity
is
formed
by
high
cliffs
a
low
valley
intervening
native
fire
and
food
on
landing
we
found
a
fire
still
burning
near
the
beach
and
beside
it
a
bundle
of
the
bark
of
the
papyrus
tree
in
which
were
carefully
packed
a
quantity
of
ground
nuts
they
were
each
about
of
an
inch
long
and
in
shape
not
unlike
a
kidney
potato
it
seemed
clear
judging
from
the
native
value
of
the
commodities
thus
rashly
abandoned
that
our
arrival
had
rather
taken
by
surprise
these
untutored
children
of
the
wilderness
we
saw
nothing
of
them
till
we
had
reembarked
when
four
or
five
only
in
number
they
returned
to
the
beach
and
we
could
perceive
that
our
foot
tracks
upon
which
they
appeared
to
hold
an
animated
debate
had
to
say
the
least
mightily
puzzled
them
i
ascended
the
highest
point
of
the
island
in
the
afternoon
and
from
thence
looked
over
several
miles
of
densely
wooded
country
but
offering
no
appearance
of
land
to
the
eastward
of
we
gazed
with
indescribable
delight
upon
the
wide
expanse
of
open
water
which
lay
before
us
in
that
direction
and
already
anticipated
the
discovery
of
some
vast
inlet
terminating
in
the
mouth
of
a
magnificent
river
upon
the
exploration
of
which
our
imagination
was
already
busily
engaged
nor
for
the
moment
did
the
thought
or
rather
the
recollection
of
the
fact
that
captain
king
had
seen
land
by
refraction
in
that
quarter
serve
to
damp
our
ardour
when
it
made
its
way
and
perseveringly
insisted
upon
engaging
a
certain
share
of
my
attention
its
presence
only
added
an
additional
motive
to
my
previous
determination
to
set
the
question
at
rest
by
personal
examination
and
in
the
interim
to
look
immediately
before
sunrise
when
the
atmosphere
within
the
tropics
is
always
clear
for
the
very
sight
i
should
have
been
most
disappointed
to
have
beheld
during
the
afternoon
i
shot
over
the
island
and
enjoyed
some
very
fair
sport
especially
with
the
and
quail
large
and
small
which
were
numerous
several
birds
not
unlike
the
crow
of
the
swan
river
colonists
were
seen
we
found
no
fresh
water
but
in
addition
to

all
was

of
the
general
characteristics
of
previous
visitations
of
the

which
we
have
been
subject

at

some
presents
in

conspicuous
situation
for
the
present
rightful
possessors
of
the
island
whose
temporary
shelter
we
had
obtained
we
hastened
back
to
the
boats
and
stood
away
to
the
eastward
for
the
low
land
seen
from
the
island
and
crossed
various
narrow
sandy
ridges
nearly
dry

and
generally
trending
north
and
south
showing
the
direction

were
formed

us

whence
i
hoped
and
believed
we
should
hereafter
date

event
of

dying

us
to
take
to
the
oars
with
the
thermometer
at
degrees
in
the

indications
of
a
river
as
we
proceeded
several
circumstances
concurred
to
satisfy
me
that
we
were
at
length
really
approaching
the
mouth
of
a
considerable
river
large
trees
drifted
past
us
with
the
ebbing
tide

each
cast
of
the
lead
proved
that
we
were

nearing

fortune
too
seemed
now
resolved
to
favour
us
the
deep
channel
most
opportunely
lying
along
the
eastern
shore
which
we
reached
soon
after
noon
and
landed
on
the
only
beach
of
sand
hereabouts
left
uncovered
at
here
for
better
security
against
the
squalls
we
had
experienced
for
the
last
two
nights
we
hauled
up
the
boats
a
name
was
soon
found
for
our
new
territory
upon
which
we
with
rueful
unanimity
conferred
that
of
point
torment
from
the
incessant
and
vindictive
attacks
of
swarms
of
mosquitoes
by
whom
it
had
evidently
been
resolved
to
give
the
newcomers
a
warm
welcome
the
greater
part
of
point
torment
is
deeply
intersected
with
deep
narrow
creeks
and
is
almost
entirely
flooded
at
it
extends
low
and
swampy
for
nearly
three
miles
in
breadth
and
then
rises
gradually
the
slope
being
well
wooded
with
the
white

also
i
remarked
the
tree
figured
by
captain
grey
and
described
by
captain
king
as
of
the
nat
ord
capparides
and
thought
to
be
a
capparis
it
also
bears
a
resemblance
to
the
adansonia
described
in
captain
tuckey
congo
this
was
but
a
small
specimen
in
fruit
of
which
the
following
brief
description
may
convey
a
tolerably
clear
idea
in
shape
it
something
resembled
the
coconut
with
a
outside
of
a
brown
and
yellow
colour
its
length
was
five
inches
and
diameter
three
the
shell
was
exceedingly
thin
and
when
opened
it
was
found
to
be
full
of
seeds
imbedded
in
a
whitish
pulp
and
of
a
not
ungrateful
taste
this
place
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
may
be
considered
the
limit
of
its
growth
in
that
direction

of
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
hereafter
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
the
northern
boundary
of
its
indigenous
empire
we
saw
no
traces
of
inhabitants
not
even
the
thin
rising
smoke
which
so
often
greeted
our
eyes
near
the
coast
we
had
recently
surveyed
i
climbed
the
highest
tree
we
could
find
and
from
the
elevation
it
afforded
looked
southwards
over
a
wide
prospect
of
nothing
but
mangroves
and
mudbanks
still
interesting
from
the
fact
that
upon
them
the
wondering
gaze
of
the
curious
european
had
never
yet
been
bent
the
mosquitoes
procuring
the
necessary
observations
completed
the
duties
of
the
day
but
alas
the
sleep
all
could
have
enjoyed
so
much
after
our
work
was
rendered
impossible
by
the
swarms
of
mosquitoes
who
at
sunset
relieved
those
of
their
tribe
upon
whom
the
day
duty
had
devolved
and
commenced
a
most
unsparing
attack
upon
us
all
devices
to
escape
them
were
tried
in
vain
and
some
of
the
men
were
really
half
mad
with
the
insufferable
annoyance
at
last
about
eight
when
all
patience
seemed
exhausted
a
welcome
peal
of
thunder
and
bright
flashes
of
lightning
announced
the
expected
and
much
desired
squall
it
served
to
blow
away
some
of
our
persecutors
but
our
rest
was
of
very
short
duration
and
i
was
at
length
compelled
to
order
the
people
to
take
to
the
boats
fairly
driven
from
the
shore
by
our
diminutive
but
invincible
assailants
the
tide
set
past
the
boats
at
the
rate
of
four
knots
per
hour
and
it
fell
feet
being
feet
more
than
we
had
as
yet
found
it
the
only
rock
seen
here
was
a
block
visible
at
it
was
a
conglomerate
and
the
most
southerly
formation
of
the
kind
we
met
with
the
february
the
daylight
found
us
all
anxiously
speculating
upon
the
probable
results
to
be
accomplished
before
the
darkness
once
more
closed
in
upon
us
but
the
morning
being
perfectly
calm
we
were
compelled
to
wait
till
the
made
this
soon
took
us
past
an
island
four
miles
from
the
eastern
shore
seen
the
evening
before
and
which
now
proved
to
be
a
narrow
strip
covered
with
the
mangrove
and
having
two
smaller
islands
nearly
identical
in
character
lying
two
miles
south
of
it
we
passed
them
at
noon
and
saw
the
land
to
the
westward
our
position
being
then
miles
south
of
point
torment
the
water
had
shoaled
in
several
places
during
the
passage
to
less
than
a
fathom
but
the
tide
hemmed
in
by
the
contraction
of
this
great
inlet
the
left
shore
of
which
gradually
trending
to
the
eastward
here
approached
to
within
six
miles
of
the
opposite
coast
still
hurried
us
on
with
a
rapidity
agreeable
enough
but
not
quite
free
from
danger
towards
what
appeared
to
be
the
mouth
of
a
large
river
if
our
exultation
had
been
great
in
the
morning
when
such
success
as
this
was
only
half
anticipated
what
was
it
at
that
exciting
moment
when
the
eventful
hour
which
should
give
us
the
triumph
of
such
a
discovery
as
that
we
now
fairly
anticipated
seemed
within
our
grasp
i
can
not
answer
for
others
but
for
myself
i
had
never
known
a
sensation
of
greater
delight
doubt
disappointment
difficulty
and
danger
all
all
were
unheeded
or
forgotten
in
the
one
proud
thought
that
for
us
was
reserved
an
enterprise
the
ultimate
results
of
which
might
in
some
future
year
affect
the
interests
of
a
great
portion
of
the
world
presently
as
if
to
recall
to
their
routine
of
duty
these
thoughts
the
boats
were
found
to
be
rapidly
carried
by
the
stream
towards
an
extensive
flat
which
appeared
to
extend
right
across
the
opening
towards
which
all
eyes
had
been
turned
with
so
much
eagerness
and
over
which
the
tide
was
boiling
and
whirling
with
great
force
to
attempt
to
cross
would
have
been
madness
there
was
nothing
therefore
to
be
done
but
patiently
await
the
rising
of
the
tide
escape
point
the
nearest
land
a
mangrove
point
bearing
one
mile
we
afterwards
named
escape
point
in
grateful
memory
of
the
providential
escapes
we
experienced
in
its
vicinity
where
the
boats
were
anchored
we
had
nearly
five
feet
at
and
the
tide
ran
past
them
at
the
rate
of
five
miles
an
hour
as
soon
as
possible
we
again
started
in
a
south
by
west
direction
and
proceeded
for
about
five
miles
when
the
boats
were
anchored
near
the
western
shore
which
we
proposed
to
visit
at
from
the
yawl
masthead
i
traced
the
shore
all
round
except
to
the
where
i
could
see
an
opening
about
a
mile
wide
the
western
land
was
slightly
elevated
perhaps
to
feet
and
clothed
with
rather
large
trees
while
to
the
eastward
the
land
appeared
very
low
as
the
tide
ebbed
we
found
to
our
disappointment
and
mortification
that
the
flat
over
which
we
reckoned
to
secure
a
passage
to
the
mainland
never
became
quite
dry
the
tide
here
falling
only
feet
while
from
its
soft
and
treacherous
character
it
was
impossible
to
cross
it
on
foot
mouth
of
the
fitzroy
all
doubt
about
our
being
in
the
mouth
of
a
river
was
put
an
end
to
by
finding
that
during
the
last
of
the
ebb
the
water
was
nearly
fresh
this
discovery
was
hailed
by
us
all
with
a
pleasure
which
persons
only
familiar
with
the
and
verdant
fields
of
england
can
not
fully
comprehend
our
success
afforded
me
a
welcome
opportunity
of
testifying
to
captain
fitzroy
my
grateful
recollection
of
his
personal
kindness
and
i
determined
with
captain
wickham
permission
to
call
this
new
river
after
his
name
thus
perpetuating
by
the
most
durable
of
monuments
the
services
and
the
career
of
one
in
whom
with
rare
and
enviable
prodigality
are
mingled
the
daring
of
the
seaman
the
accomplishments
of
the
student
and
the
graces
of
the
christian
of
whose
calm
fortitude
in
the
hour
of
impending
danger
or
whose
habitual
carefulness
for
the
interests
of
all
under
his
command
if
i
forbear
to
speak
i
am
silent
because
while
i
recognise
their
existence
and
perceive
how
much
they
exalt
the
character
they
adorn
i
feel
too
that
they
have
elevated
it
above
either
the
need
or
the
reach
of
any
eulogy
within
my
power
to
offer
i
felt
pretty
confident
that
the
first
rush
of
the
tide
upon
its
reflux
would
be
violent
and
had
made
preparation
accordingly
in
the
first
watch
these
anticipations
were
realized
and
i
was
roused
from
a
momentary
doze
by
a
loud
roaring
which
i
at
once
recognized
to
be
the
voice
of
thunder
heralding
the
advancing
tide
the
night
was
pitch
dark
and
though
i
instinctively
turned
my
eyes
towards
the
offing
i
could
see
nothing
but
as
each
anxious
moment
passed
away
the
fearful
voice
of
the
waters
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
and
within
less
time
than
i
have
occupied
in
the
narration
the
full
force
of
the
rush
of
tide
coming
on
like
a
wall
several
feet
high
and
bringing
our
anchor
away
with
it
was
upon
us
the
cable
thus
slackened
the
yawl
sheered
and
was
thrown
violently
upon
her
broadside
in
the
midst
of
it
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
shores
lashed
to
each
mast
she
must
inevitably
have
capsized
the
whaleboat
fared
better
being
lighter
she
was
the
sooner
afloat
and
besides
her
buoyant
bow
was
the
better
able
to
receive
and
resist
the
shock
when
the
tide
slacked
we
returned
to
the
deep
water
off
escape
point
and
spent
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
quiet
i
would
fain
hope
so
far
as
most
of
us
were
concerned
not
without
a
thankful
remembrance
of
him
whose
merciful
providence
had
been
so
recently
manifested
in
our
behalf

in

i
proceeded
with

to
trace
the
river
immediately
after
daylight
against
the
last
of
the
ebb
tide
and
with
the
thermometer
at
degrees
we
contrived
to
reach
a
spot
two
miles
beyond
point
escape
before
noon
from
point
escape
upwards
there
appeared
to
be
at
no
regular
channel
the
bed
of
the
river
assumed
the
aspect
of
an
extensive
flat
of
mud
intersected
with
small
rivulets
or
streams
that
served
to
drain
it
no
signs
of
human
habitation
were
seen
along
its
banks
which
divided
by
numerous
small
creeks
and
thickly
fringed
with

unfailing
mangrove

away
in

and
drear
monotony

broken
towards

disturbed

back
to

perilous
situation
the
shore
was
a
soft
mud
in
which
the
small
mangroves
had
found
a
most
congenial
soil
while
our
journey
every
now
and
then
arrested
by
the
intervention
of
one
or
other
of
the
numerous
little
creeks
of
which
i
have
before
spoken
promised
to
prove
a
more
fatiguing
if
not
more
hazardous
affair
than
we
had
originally
contemplated
we
managed
at
first
by
ascending
their
banks
for
a
short
distance
from
the
river
to
jump
across
these
opposing
creeks
but
as
the
tide
rose
they
filled
and
widened
in
proportion
and
each
moment
increased
the
difficulties
of
our
position
now
heightened
by
the
untoward
discovery
that
william
ask
the
seaman
who
had
accompanied
us
was
unable
to
swim
time
and
tide
however
wait
for
no
man
and
the
rapidly
rising
waters
had
flooded
the
whole
of
the
low
land
which
formed
this
bank
of
the
river
so
that
we
were
compelled
to
wade
feeling
with
a
stick
for
the
edges
of
the
creeks
in
our
route
over
each
of
which
helpman
and
myself
had
alternately
to
swim
in
order
to
pass
the
arms
undamaged
and
then
ask
making
the
best
jump
that
he
could
muster
for
the
occasion
was
dragged
ashore
on
the
opposite
side
at
length
we
reached
a
creek
the
breadth
of
which
rendered
this
mode
of
proceeding
no
longer
practicable
and
we
were
compelled
to
stop
being
fortunately
very
near
the
point
where
i
had
directed
the
boat
to
meet
us
our
situation
was
now
anything
but
pleasant
the
water
being
already
above
our
knees
and
the
tide
having
still
several
hours
to
rise
while
the
mangrove
trees
by
which
we
were
surrounded
were
all
too
slender
to
afford
the
least
support
in
this
state
of
affairs
leaving
helpman
with
ask
who
had
secured
a
piece
of
drift
timber
as
a
last
resource
i
made
my
way
to
the
edge
of
the
shore
only
to
find
that
the
boat
unable
to
stem
the
current
had
anchored
some
distance
above
us
helpman
and
myself
might
have
reached
her
by
swimming
but
even
could
i
have
easily
reconciled
myself
to
part
with
our
arms
and
instruments
at
any
rate
to
abandon
poor
ask
in
the
dilemma
into
which
i
had
brought
him
was
not
to
be
thought
of
by
repeated
discharges
of
my
gun
i
at
last
succeeded
in
attracting
the
attention
of
the
boat
crew
who
made
an
immediate
and
desperate
effort
to
come
to
our
assistance
while
their
strength
lasted
they
just
contrived
to
hold
their
own
against
the
tide
then
drifting
astern
were
again
compelled
to
anchor
the
attempt
was
renewed
when
an
equally
desperate
struggle
was
followed
by
just
as
fruitless
a
result
the
force
of
the
stream
was
clearly
more
than
they
could
overcome
and
an
intervening
bank
precluded
any
attempt
to
creep
up
to
us
along
the
shore
most
anxiously
did
i
watch
the
water
as
it
changed
its
upward
level
almost
with
the
rapidity
of
an
inch
a
minute
being
in
doubt
whether
it
would
rise
above
our
heads
ere
it
afforded
a
sufficient
depth
to
carry
the
boat
over
the
intervening
bank
and
bring
us
the
only
assistance
that
would
afford
a
chance
for
our
lives
i
breathed
a
short
but
most
fervent
prayer
to
him
in
whose
hands
are
the
issues
of
life
and
death
and
turned
back
to
cheer
my
comrades
with
the
chance
of
rescue
and
providential
escape
nor
shall
i
ever
forget
the
expression
of
thankfulness
and
gratitude
which
lit
up
the
face
of
poor
ask
as
the
whispers
of
hope
were
confirmed
by
the
welcome
advance
of
the
whaleboat
bows
through
the
almost
submerged
mangroves
just
as
the
water
had
topped
our
shoulders
and
therefore
barely
in
time
to
confirm
upon
this
locality
its
former
title
of
point
escape
we
now
pulled
down
to
this
point
and
waited
for
the
tide
to
fall
in
order
to
obtain
the
necessary
observations
for
determining
its
position
those
for
latitude
taken
in
the
early
part
of
the
night
gave
a
result
worked
on
the
spot
of
degrees
minutes
south
being
an
increase
in
latitude
of
miles
from
the
present
position
of
the
beagle
having
now
but
two
days
provisions
remaining
i
determined
on
completing
the
survey
of
the
western
shore
south
of
valentine
island
and
then
to
return
and
report
our
discovery
knowing
that
captain
wickham
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
prosecute
it
to
the
utmost
return
to
the
ship
march
these
plans
were
accordingly
carried
into
effect
and
we
returned
to
the
ship
on
the
morning
of
the
of
march
we
found
all
well
on
board
with
the
exception
of
poor
usborne
whom
we
were
delighted
to
see
so
far
recovered
one
sentiment
of
satisfaction
pervaded
the
whole
company
when
informed
of
our
success
and
as
i
had
anticipated
captain
wickham
at
once
determined
upon
further
exploring
our
new
discovery
in
lighter
boats
first
placing
the
ship
as
near
the
mouth
of
it
as
practicable
during
the
squall
on
the
first
night
of
our
absence
the
ship
parted
her
cable
and
was
nearly
on
the
rocks
our
sportsmen
had
been
actively
and
successfully
employed
during
our
absence
having
shot
a
great
number
of
quail
they
had
seen
two
emus
and
bynoe
and
dring
had
obtained
several
specimens
of
rare
birds
all
of
which
are
now
figured
by
gould
in
his
birds
of
australia
a
few
natives
had
also
been
seen
but
they
were
too
wary
to
permit
any
intercourse
with
them
march
this
was
sunday
and
no
imperative
necessity
hindered
our
making
it
a
day
of
rest
various
necessary
observations
occupied
the
greater
part
of
monday
and
on
the
day
following
the

the

suited
us
but
badly
and
we
were
only
able
to
proceed
about
four
miles
beyond
escape
point
where
we
secured
the
boats
in
a
creek
out
of
the
influence
of
the
tide
we
found
much
less
water
off
escape
point
than
on
our
former
visit
excursion
into
the
interior
in
the
evening
we
made
an
excursion
into
the
interior
it
was
one
vast
unbroken
level
covered
with
a
strong
and
wiry
grass
intersected
with
numerous
watercourses
which
the
tide
filled
at
there
were
also
indications
of
more
important
but
less
regular
visits
from
the
sea
here
and
there
a
solitary
tree
assisted
us
in
estimating
the
distance
we
had
walked
we
saw
two
emus
in
this
plain
which
appeared
also
a
favourite
resort
of
quail
and
a
pigeon
we
could
not
get
within
shot
of
the
wary
emus
but
the
quail
and
pigeons
afforded
us
good
sport
notwithstanding
the
ceaseless
attacks
of
the
mosquitoes
which
swarmed
in
the
long
grass
and
defied
anything
less
impenetrable
than
mackintosh
leggings
encumbrances
not
desirable
for
a
pedestrian
with
the
thermometer
at
degrees
particularly
when
worn
over
a
pair
of
flushing
trousers
thus
defended
i
could
in
some
degree
defy
these
tormenting
assailants
and
at
night
under
the
additional
security
afforded
by
a
large
painted
coat
contrived
to
secure
two
or
three
hours
of
unbroken
rest
a
luxury
few
of
my
companions
enjoyed
it
was
with
much
disappointment
that
we
found
the
channel
occupied
at
by
a
mere
rivulet
draining
the
extensive
mud
flats
then
left
uncovered
hope
however
though
somewhat
sobered
was
not
altogether
destroyed
by
this
malapropos
discovery
and
we
still
looked
forward
with
an
interest
but
little
abated
to
the
results
of
a
complete
survey
of
our
new
discovery
march
we
moved
on
when
the
tide
served
keeping
close
to
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
where
there
appeared
at
the
largest
stream
then
barely
two
feet
deep
following
the
sinuosity
of
the
shore
our
general
direction
was
south
and
after
we
had
thus
proceeded
two
miles
we
found
the
width
of
the
river
suddenly
contract
from
three
miles
to
one
the
banks
were
low
and
covered
with
a
coarse
grass
natives
here
we
saw
three
natives
stretching
their
long
spare
bodies
over
the
bank
watching
the
leading
boat
with
the
fixed
gaze
of
apparent
terror
and
anxiety
sso
rivetted
was
their
attention
that
they
allowed
my
boat
to
approach
unnoticed
within
a
very
short
distance
of
them
but
when
they
suddenly
caught
sight
of
it
they
gave
a
yell
of
mingled
astonishment
and
alarm
and
flinging
themselves
back
into
the
long
grass
were
almost
instantly
out
of
sight
they
were
evidently
greatly
alarmed
and
as
miago
whose
presence
might
have
given
them
confidence
was
not
with
us
it
seemed
hopeless
to
attempt
any
communication
with
them
much
as
we
should
have
liked
to
convince
them
that
these
strange
white
creatures
were
of
a
race
of
beings
formed
like
themselves
though
even
of
our
existence
they
could
have
had
no
previous
idea
exploration
of
the
river
six
miles
from
our
last
night
bivouac
still
keeping
our
southerly
direction
brought
us
to
some
low
grassy
islets
extending
almost
across
the
river
and
leaving
only
confined
and
shallow
channels
through
one
of
which
we
had
at
half
tide
some
difficulty
in
finding
a
passage
for
the
boats
the
river
now
widened
out
a
little
and
we
found
the
deep
water
near
the
western
bank
the
appearance
of
the
country
remaining
unaltered
we
landed
to
pass
the
night
at
a
rocky
point
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
one
mile
south
from
the
most
western
islet
of
the
chain
just
described
as
almost
preventing
our
ascent
the
depth
of
the
river
at
this
point
was
about
twelve
feet
at
and
its
breadth
some
four
or
five
hundred
yards
we
found
the
water
fresh
at
all
times
of
tide
which
here
rose
only
eight
feet
being
ten
feet
less
than
its
greatest
rise
eight
miles
nearer
the
mouth
where
the
time
of
at
the
full
and
change
of
the
moon
occurs
at
hours
minutes
this
was
the
first
rock
formation
we
had
noticed
since
leaving
point
torment
a
distance
of
nearly
thirty
miles
it
was
a
very
red
sandstone
darkened
and
rendered
heavy
by
the
presence
of
ferruginous
particles
the
appearance
of
the
country
now
began
to
improve
the
eastern
bank
was
thickly
wooded
and
a
mile
higher
up
the
western
appeared
clothed
in
verdure
i
noticed
here
the
same
kind
of
tree
seen
for
the
first
time
behind
our
last
night
bivouac
it
was
small
and
with
a
rough
bark
not
unlike
that
of
the
common
elm
and
its
little
pointed
leaf
of
a
deep
dark
green
contrasted
with
the
evergreen
eucalypti
by
which
it
was
surrounded
reminded
me
of
the
various
tints
that
give
the
charm
of
constant
variety
to
our
english
woods
and
lend
to
each
succeeding
season
a
distinctive
and
characteristic
beauty
the
diameter
of
the
largest
tree
of
this
kind
was
only
eight
inches
it
was
exceedingly
hard
and
of
a
very
dark
red
colour
except
a
white
rim
about
an
inch
in
thickness
this
wood
worked
and
looked
the
best
in
a
table
i
had
made
out
of
various
specimens
of
woods
collected
on
the
coast
of
australia
sufferings
from
mosquitoes
i
must
be
pardoned
for
again
alluding
to
our
old
enemies
the
mosquitoes
but
the
reception
they
gave
us
this
night
is
too
deeply
engraven
on
my
memory
to
be
ever
quite
forgotten
night
of
torment
they
swarmed
around
us
and
by
the
light
of
the
fire
the
blanket
bags
in
which
the
men
sought
to
protect
themselves
seemed
literally
black
with
their
crawling
and
stinging
persecutors
woe
to
the
unhappy
wretch
who
had
left
unclosed
the
least
hole
in
his
bag
the
persevering
mosquitoes
surely
found
it
out
and
as
surely
drove
the
luckless
occupant
out
of
his
retreat
i
noticed
one
man
dressed
as
if
in
the
frozen
north
hold
his
bag
over
the
fire
till
it
was
quite
full
of
smoke
and
then
get
into
it
a
companion
securing
the
mouth
over
his
head
at
the
apparent
risk
of
suffocation
he
obtained
three
hours
of
what
he
gratefully
termed
comfortable
sleep
but
when
he
emerged
from
his
shelter
where
he
had
been
stewed
up
with
the
thermometer
at
degrees
his
appearance
may
be
easily
imagined
our
hands
were
in
constant
requisition
to
keep
the
tormentors
from
the
face
and
ears
which
often
received
a
hearty
whack
aimed
in
the
fruitless
irritation
of
the
moment
at
our
assailants
and
which
sometimes
ended
in
adding
headache
to
the
list
of
annoyances
strike
as
you
please
the
ceaseless
humming
of
the
invincible
mosquito
close
to
your
ear
seems
to
mock
his
unhappy
victim
one
poor
fellow
whose
patience
was
quite
exhausted
fairly
jumped
into
the
river
to
escape
further
persecution
we
had
the
wind
from
to
during
the
afternoon
but
at
it
veered
round
to
while
getting
the
observations
for
time
and
latitude
some
of
us
were
compelled
to
remain
quiet
an
opportunity
our
tiny
assailants
instantly
availed
themselves
of
covering
our
faces
and
hands
to
listen
quietly
to
their
hum
and
feel
their
long
stings
darting
into
your
flesh
might
put
the
patience
of
job
himself
to
a
severe
trial
ascent
of
the
fitzroy
march
after
such
a
night
of
torment
we
hailed
the
morning
with
delight
and
having
partaken
of
an
early
breakfast
proceeded
on
our
interesting
discovery
the
first
reach
took
us
more
than
a
mile
in
a
by
west
direction
the
width
of
it
being
towards
the
latter
end
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
deepest
water
from
seven
to
eight
feet
was
on
the
west
side
and
a
dry
flat
of
sand
fronted
the
other
for
some
distance
the
course
of
the
river
now
changed
first
to
then
round
to
enclosing
a
mile
of
ground
we
had
great
difficulty
owing
to
the
water
being
very
shoal
in
getting
our
boats
through
the
next
reach
which
was
rather
more
than
a
mile
in
a
west
by
south
direction
after
threading
our
way
through
three
more
reaches
trending
and
south
and
from
half
to
one
mile
in
length
the
shades
of
evening
and
fatigue
attending
a
long
and
unsatisfactory
day
work
warned
us
that
it
was
time
to
seek
a
for
the
night
although
we
had
but
little
hopes
of
obtaining
any
we
had
made
good
but
six
miles
during
the
day
in
a
general
by
west
direction
our
progress
being
delayed
by
the
difficulty
we
had
in
getting
the
boats
over
the
shallows
and
by
a
current
running
at
the
rate
of
from
one
to
two
miles
an
hour
the
depth
of
the
river
varied
during
the
day
from
one
to
fourteen
feet
and
its
width
from
three
to
five
hundred
yards
in
the
deep
reaches
were
the
wrecks
of
large
trees
rearing
their
decayed
heads
in
evidence
of
the
resistless
fury
of
the
torrent
that
had
torn
them
from
their
roots
during
some
vast
inundation
traces
of
which
still
remain
on
the
banks
many
feet
above
the
present
level
of
the
river
the
general
aspect
of
the
country
had
improved
and
the
eastern
bank
reached
an
elevation
of
feet
it
was
covered
with
long
green
grass
and
thickly
wooded
with
a
luxuriant
growth
of
the
white
eucalyptus
while
the
almost
total
absence
of
every
appearance
of
animal
life
impressed
an
air
of
solemn
tranquillity
upon
the
whole
scene
perhaps
it
was
from
there
being
little
to
admire
in
the
surrounding
scenery
that
we
were
so
much
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
western
sky
as
its
gilded
clouds
marked
the
departure
of
the
great
ruler
of
the
day
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
behold
a
more
splendid
sunset
but
with
us
after
another
sleepless
night
his
rise
as
he
tinged
the
eastern
sky
was
hailed
with
even
greater
delight
march
at
daylight
i
climbed
the
highest
tree
i
could
find
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
in
order
to
get
a
peep
at
the
surrounding
country
the
prospect
however
was
but
limited
the
landscape
presented
to
my
view
was
an
almost
uninterrupted
level
open
woodlands
with
here
and
there
a
few
grassy
spots
were
its
prevailing
features
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
river
itself
beyond
the
reach
in
which
the
boats
were
lying
its
upper
extremity
bore
south
by
west
and
was
about
half
a
mile
from
our
halting
place
i
made
a
discovery
in
climbing
this
tree
which
i
hoped
to
make
available
in
our
farther
ascent
of
the
fitzroy
should
we
be
so
fortunate
as
to
accomplish
its
further
exploration
or
in
any
similar
circumstances
during
our
examination
of
these
untrodden
wilds
it
was
this
and
i
mention
it
as
the
hint
may
be
useful
to
others
i
found
our
enemies
the
mosquitoes
did
not
resort
to
the
higher
portions
of
the
tree
and
that
by
climbing
some
thirty
feet
from
the
ground
a
night
repose
or
at
least
a
night
undisturbed
by
their
attacks
might
be
obtained
hastening
back
to
the
boats
we
pushed
on
but
were
some
time
getting
to
the
end
of
the
reach
the
shallowness
of
the
water
rendering
our
advance
difficult
and
tedious
entering
at
length
the
next
which
trended
for
about
half
a
mile
the
river
gradually
widened
out
until
it
attained
a
breadth
of
about
half
that
space
an
extensive
flat
of
sand
fronted
the
eastern
bank
which
was
very
low
and
though
now
dry
bore
undoubted
marks
of
being
not
unfrequently
visited
by
floods
the
western
bank
of
the
next
reach
was
low
and
broken
evidently
forming
a
group
of
low
grassy
islands
when
the
river
is
in
a
higher
state
some
yellow
sandstone
cliffs
from
ten
to
sixteen
feet
in
height
formed
the
opposite
bank
of
this
reach
which
extended
barely
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
from
a
south
by
east
to
a
south
by
west
direction
and
varied
in
width
from
one
to
two
hundred
yards
we
now
entered
a
reach
of
the
river
trending
south
for
a
mile
and
a
quarter
having
a
breadth
of
about
a
hundred
yards
and
a
depth
in
many
places
of
twelve
feet
being
twice
that
which
we
had
usually
found
in
any
of
the
lower
reaches
with
scarcely
any
stream
soon
after
entering
this
remarkable
sheet
of
water
we
noticed
a
rock
formation
in
its
western
banks
this
we
found
to
be
a
red
sandstone
with
fragments
of
quartz
and
extended
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
along
the
edge
of
the
water
over
many
parts
of
it
was
a
coating
of
a
dark
and
metallic
appearance
about
three
inches
thick
and
the
surface
in
places
presented
a
glazed
or
smelted
appearance
darwin
in
his
work
upon
volcanic
islands
page
alludes
to
this
formation
under
the
head
of
superficial
ferruginous
beds
and
thus
concludes
his
observations
the
origin
of
these
superficial
beds
though
sufficiently
obscure
seems
to
be
due
to
alluvial
action
on
detritus
abounding
with
iron
as
we
proceeded
along
this
canal
for
such
was
the
appearance
of
the
reach
we
were
now
ascending
we
surprised
a
small
party
of
natives
they
were
at
the
water
edge
beneath
a
high
mound
of
loose
white
sand
over
which
the
children
were
some
time
in
making
their
escape
struggling
and
screaming
with
anxiety
and
fear
as
they
half
buried
themselves
beneath
its
treacherous
surface
and
sometimes
after
almost
gaining
the
summit
sliding
back
again
to
the
base
all
parental
care
seemed
for
the
moment
lost
in
the
overwhelming
sense
of
present
danger
caused
by
the
strange
and
unknown
spectacle
thus
suddenly
presented
to
the
gaze
of
these
poor
savages
our
white
faces
curious
garments
moving
boats
the
regular
motions
and
unaccustomed
sounds
of
our
heavy
oars
must
indeed
have
filled
them
with
amazement
i
have
since
frequently
remarked
that
our
oars
created
more
wonder
or
alarm
among
the
various
tribes
who
first
learnt
through
us
the
existence
of
their
white
brethren
than
almost
any
other
instrument
of
which
they
could
at
all
understand
the
use
perhaps
as
they
propel
their
frail
rafts
with
a
spear
they
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
our
oars
were
also
immense
spears
which
being
their
chief
weapons
must
have
given
us
a
formidable
appearance
we
noticed
among
the
trees
on
the
banks
of
this
natural
canal
two
varieties
of
the
palm
both
kinds
had
been
observed
by
brown
in
the
gulf
of
carpentaria
during
captain
flinders
voyage
at
the
end
of
this
reach
which
extended
for
a
mile
and
a
half
in
a
by
south
direction
the
river
was
scarcely
yards
wide
and
the
depth
had
decreased
from
to
feet
the
current
scarcely
perceptible
in
the
deep
water
now
ran
with
a
velocity
of
from
one
to
two
miles
per
hour
here
therefore
the
fitzroy
may
be
said
to
assume
all
the
more
distinctive
features
of
an
australian
river
deep
reaches
connected
by
shallows
and
probably
forming
during
the
droughts
which
characterize
australia
an
unlinked
chain
of
ponds
or
lagoons
and
in
places
leaving
no
other
indication
of
its
former
existence
than
the
banks
and
deep
holes
thirsty
and
desolate
as
a
desert
plain
at
this
point
the
river
divided
into
two
branches
one
having
an
and
the
other
a
direction
anxious
to
determine
which
as
the
larger
best
deserved
our
exploration
we
landed
at
a
high
grassy
point
on
the
west
bank
from
the
top
of
the
highest
tree
in
the
neighbourhood
i
commanded
an
extensive
view
of
the
wide
and
landscape
then
first
submitted
to
the
scrutiny
of
a
european
varied
and
undefined
are
the
thoughts
called
forth
at
such
a
moment
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
at
once
occupy
and
almost
confound
the
imagination
new
feelings
accompany
new
perceptions
and
gazing
for
the
first
time
upon
a
vast
and
unknown
land
the
mind
restless
and
active
as
the
roving
life
by
which
it
is
informed
expands
for
the
reception
of
the
crowding
fancies
called
into
life
as
by
the
wand
of
the
magician
after
yielding
for
a
while
to
the
influence
of
the
scene
i
was
glad
to
perceive
the
greater
magnitude
of
the
southerly
branch
of
the
river
which
offered
the
most
direct
line
into
the
interior
i
could
trace
each
stream
for
nearly
three
miles
but
that
which
trended
to
the
east
was
a
mere
rivulet
both
flowed
through
a
perfectly
level
country
seven
miles
was
about
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
over
this
level
to
the
westward
the
country
was
open
the
trees
were
small
and
in
clumps
with
green
grassy
patches
between
but
in
other
directions
it
was
densely
wooded
and
on
the
eastern
bank
the
trees
were
large
in
the
branches
of
the
one
i
ascended
rushes
deposited
by
the
current
were
found
feet
above
the
present
level
of
the
stream
this
part
of
the
country
is
therefore
sometimes
visited
by
heavy
floods
they
do
not
however
seem
to
depend
immediately
upon
the
quantity
of
rain
for
while
the
whole
face
of
the
landscape
indicated
large
and
recent
supplies
the
river
appeared
little
if
at
all
affected
by
them
having
determined
to
follow
the
larger
branch
of
the
fitzroy
we
continued
on
our
course
and
found
that
beyond
this
point
the
river
again
widened
to
nearly
yards
but
that
a
chain
of
small
islets
extending
from
bank
to
bank
nearly
stopped
our
proceeding
further
this
obstacle
was
however
overcome
after
some
difficulty
and
still
proceeding
upwards
another
mile
we
came
to
a
narrow
rapid
and
shallow
reach
which
brought
us
into
another
still
and
deep
about
yards
wide
and
bounded
by
high
grassy
banks
through
this
we
pursued
our
way
right
merrily
indulging
in
the
golden
anticipation
that
the
fitzroy
would
yet
convey
our
boats
some
distance
into
the
interior
of
that
vast
and
unknown
continent
with
the
present
condition
and
future
destiny
of
which
our
thoughts
were
so
often
busy
impediments
in
the
river
scarcely
however
had
we
made
good
another
mile
when
we
found
ourselves
entangled
among
a
cluster
of
small
islets
and
sunken
trees
which
almost
wholly
choked
up
the
channel
the
river
thus
pent
up
ran
through
the
small
openings
in
this
barrier
with
great
velocity
while
above
it
had
again
assumed
the
deep
still
character
which
i
have
before
had
occasion
to
describe
we
had
partly
overcome
this
impediment
when
captain
wickham
decided
upon
giving
up
the
attempt
and
ordered
the
boats
to
return
considering
the
evident
risks
too
great
to
justify
further
perseverance
we
therefore
gave
up
the
exploration
of
the
fitzroy
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
longitude
degrees
minutes
east
having
traced
its
course
for
miles
in
a
general
direction
and
having
penetrated
miles
from
the
coastline
towards
the
centre
of
australia
from
which
we
were
still
distant
miles
my
view
from
the
treetop
extended
about
four
miles
beyond
the
furthest
point
we
had
reached
on
the
river
it
had
been
our
good
fortune
to
add
to
the
geography
of
australia
its
banks
here
were
feet
high
and
covered
with
grass
partially
broken
or
washed
down
they
disclosed
to
view
a
rich
alluvial
soil
nearly
two
feet
deep
the
trees
we
found
most
common
during
our
expedition
into
this
portion
of
the
new
lands
of
australia
consisted
chiefly
of
two
species
of
palm
and
three
of
the
eucalypti
stunted
banksia
acacia
and
the
singular
tree
before
mentioned
the
birds
we
saw
were
wholly
those
belonging
to
the
land
and
were
chiefly
black
and
white
cockatoos
and
a
variety
of
finches
we
neither
saw
nor
caught
any
fish
and
the
absence
of
waterfowl
led
us
to
suppose
they
were
scarce
return
of
the
boats
all
the
excitement
and
interest
we
had
enjoyed
in
exploring
the
fitzroy
thus
far
now
left
us
and
our
return
was
comparatively
tedious
and
monotonous
work
march
we
however
managed
to
reach
our
last
night
bivouac
by
dark
and
towards
the
close
of
the
next
day
we
got
as
far
down
as
the
outer
grassy
islet
in
the
entrance
of
the
river
the
night
was
stormy
but
the
wind
and
rain
together
kept
away
the
mosquitoes
and
enabled
us
to
obtain
a
little
most
welcome
rest
this
change
in
the
weather
was
sudden
hitherto
we
had
been
singularly
fortunate
each
succeeding
night
and
returning
morn
being
in
cleanness
and
beauty
only
a
repetition
of
its
predecessor
march
the
morning
was
again
fine
and
the
bright
sky
was
not
disfigured
by
the
least
trace
of
the
dark
clouds
that
had
so
lately
overspread
it
the
tide
fortunately
favoured
our
making
an
early
start
on
passing
escape
point
so
named
as
the
reader
may
recollect
in
grateful
remembrance
of
the
providential
escape
a
small
party
of
us
experienced
there
we
saw
an
alligator
slide
his
unwieldy
carcass
from
the
soft
upon
which
he
had
been
lazily
reclining
into
one
of
the
creeks
we
had
so
much
difficulty
in
crossing
we
could
not
but
feel
grateful
that
even
the
existence
of
these
monster
reptiles
in
this
river
was
then
unknown
to
us
as
the
bare
thought
of
a
visit
from
one
of
them
would
have
added
to
the
unpleasantness
of
our
position
while
the
actual
presence
of
so
wholesale
a
gastronomer
would
perhaps
have
given
another
and
less
auspicious
name
to
escape
point
a
creek
ten
miles
from
point
torment
afforded
us
shelter
for
the
night
which
was
again
wet
and
squally
march
at
daybreak
the
blue
vault
above
was
still
disfigured
by
dark
inky
blotches
of
clouds
we
reached
the
ship
before
breakfast
and
found
that
helpman
and
keys
had
ascertained
that
the
opening
on
the
side
of
point
torment
was
a
great
bay
extending
ten
miles
in
a
direction
with
a
width
of
the
same
distance
its
shores
throughout
were
fringed
with
mangroves
through
which
the
tide
found
its
way
inundating
many
miles
of
the
interior
at
stokes
bay
in
the
north
and
south
corners
of
the
depths
of
this
bay
they
found
an
inlet
each
being
about
three
miles
deep
narrow
sandy
ridges
almost
dry
at
trending
to
the
and
separated
by
channels
from
three
to
four
fathoms
occupied
the
greater
portion
of
this
extensive
bay
which
captain
wickham
out
of
compliment
named
after
myself
point
torment
afforded
a
very
fair
field
for
the
exertions
of
our
collectors
in
natural
history
without
wishing
to
bore
my
readers
with
another
long
mosquito
story
i
think
the
following
may
be
interesting
an
officer
entangled
in
mangroves
one
of
the
officers
on
a
shooting
excursion
lost
his
way
and
got
entangled
in
a
mangrove
forest
where
the
ground
being
a
soft
mud
travelling
became
very
laborious
particularly
in
a
temperature
of
degrees
and
without
water
fatigue
hastened
by
thirst
at
length
quite
knocked
up
my
shipmate
who
threw
himself
exhausted
on
the
ground
in
vain
did
he
seek
for
a
little
rest
for
no
sooner
was
he
quiet
than
swarms
of
mosquitoes
assailed
him
and
forced
him
again
on
his
legs
unwelcome
as
these
tormenting
visitors
generally
are
they
were
probably
in
this
case
the
means
of
saving
my
friend
life
as
goaded
on
by
their
unceasing
attacks
to
exertions
otherwise
out
of
the
question
he
eventually
reached
assistance
and
was
brought
on
board
in
a
most
helpless
condition
the
tide
here
was
two
hours
later
than
at
foul
point
the
greatest
rise
noticed
in
the
ship
was
thirty
feet
which
was
seven
feet
less
than
we
had
found
it
in
the
yawl
we
had
several
heavy
squalls
from
eastward
this
afternoon
and
during
the
early
part
of
the
night
with
rain
and
thunder
march
the
morning
broke
dull
and
gloomy
with
a
light
breeze
from
the
eastward
there
were
altogether
evident
symptoms
of
a
decided
and
immediate
change
in
the
weather
the
survey
of
the
portion
of
the
sound
being
now
complete
the
ship
was
taken
over
to
the
high
rocky
land
lying
north
miles
from
point
torment
we
crossed
the
flat
extending
four
miles
from
that
point
in
from
two
to
three
fathoms
at
the
soundings
afterwards
varied
from
nine
to
eleven
fathoms
with
a
soft
muddy
sand
bottom
we
anchored
in
seven
fathoms
one
mile
and
a
half
from
the
southern
of
two
small
rocky
islets
lying
miles
north
from
point
torment
and
three
from
the
rocky
shore
behind
them
a
sandbank
dry
at
extended
from
these
islets
to
within
half
a
mile
of
the
ship
change
of
landscape
our
eyes
were
now
relieved
by
a
pleasing
change
of
landscape
the
land
had
wholly
changed
in
character
from
that
of
which
we
had
seen
so
much
and
grown
so
weary
it
no
longer
stretched
away
in
an
illimitable
and
boundless
plain
but
rising
abruptly
from
the
water
edge
attained
an
elevation
of
feet
the
highest
part
of
this
range
afterwards
named
compass
hill
bore
north
by
west
distant
four
and
a
quarter
miles
we
were
all
of
course
exceedingly
anxious
to
visit
this
new
land
but
the
weather
strange
to
say
put
our
patience
to
a
trial
of
four
days
during
which
it
equalled
in
severity
any
we
had
experienced
under
swan
point
it
commenced
with
dark
masses
of
clouds
rising
in
the
east
which
were
soon
followed
by
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
with
heavy
rain
gradually
freshening
as
it
came
round
to
the
westward
blowing
hardest
between
and
the
barometer
being
out
of
order
we
were
unable
to
observe
how
this
unusual
change
would
have
affected
that
instrument
the
thermometer
however
fell
to
degrees
an
alteration
of
temperature
which
combined
with
the
dampness
of
the
atmosphere
exposed
us
to
the
novel
sensation
of
cold
we
noticed
the
time
of
was
about
fifteen
minutes
earlier
than
at
point
torment
the
setting
and
the
ebb
west
the
former
at
a
rate
of
two
miles
and
the
latter
one
mile
per
hour
march
at
length
the
wished
for
change
arrived
and
we
again
beheld
this
morning
the
deep
pure
blue
of
a
southern
sky
we
were
all
eager
to
commence
our
exploration
and
usborne
ever
anxious
to
be
actively
employed
was
so
far
recovered
that
he
induced
the
surgeon
though
reluctantly
to
allow
him
to
again
share
in
the
duties
of
the
survey
he
was
accordingly
despatched
to
look
for
a
berth
for
the
ship
further
to
the
while
captain
wickham
and
myself
went
towards
compass
hill
we
were
accompanied
by
bynoe
who
during
our
excursion
was
fortunate
enough
to
add
several
rare
birds
to
his
collection
exploration
of
the
bay
we
landed
in
a
small
sandy
bay
at
the
western
end
of
a

the
sandbank
fronting
them
we
found
to
extend
to
the
bay
we
landed
in
to
the
westward
of
it
there
was
deep
water
close
to
the
shore
wood

water
might
easily
be
obtained
in
this
bay
a
circumstance
that
may
give
it
value
in
the
eyes
of
future
navigators
as
it
did
in
ours
before
ascending
the
hill
we
crossed
a
flat
clothed
with
rich
grass
out
of
which
we
flushed
several
we
found
one
of
their
nests
on
the
ground
containing
four
eggs
in
size
and
colour
they
resembled
the
domestic
pigeon
the
nimble
manner
in
which
these
birds
hop
along
the
branches
of
trees
with
their
long
tails
whisking
behind
give
them
at
the
first
glance
more
the
appearance
of
monkeys
than

centropus
phasianellus
a
new
vine
we
found
here
the
tree
of
large
size
bearing
fruit
and
also
a
vine
which
from
all
the
information
i
have
since
been
able
to
collect
appears
to
be
quite
a
new
specimen
it
bore
a
small
but
black
berry
similar
in
shape
and
general
appearance
to
the
grape
sometimes
seen
climbing
over
the
cottage
doors
in
england
each
fruit
contained
three
large
seeds
in
shape
and
size
resembling
the
coffee
berry
it
was
growing
in
a
light
sandy
soil
and
the
temperature
to
which
it
was
exposed
varies
from
to
degrees
it
is
a
matter
of
great
regret
that
i
was
not
able
to
introduce
this
new
species
of
vine
into
england
the
seeds
and
specimens
of
it
having
been
unfortunately
destroyed
by
mice
and
insects
i
was
however
more
fortunate
at
sydney
and
swan
river
from
the
description
i
gave
of
this
vine
to
sir
hooker
he
thought
it
quite
new
compass
hill
we
at
length
gained
the
top
of
compass
hill
which
we
found
to
be
a
slight
mound
on
a
platform
of
coarse
sandstone
formation
with
fragments
of
quartz
the
sandstone
was
tinged
with
red
and
appeared
to
be
crumbling
away
a
straggling
growth
of
white
eucalypti
covered
the
crest
of
this
height
which
rather
spoilt
the
view
we
had
promised
ourselves
however
by
climbing
several
of
them
i
managed
to
see
all
round
west
six
and
a
half
miles
there
was
a
snug
cove
fronted
by
a
small
island
from
whence
the
coast
appeared
to
take
a
more
northerly
direction
the
extremes
of
a
large
sheet
of
water
bore
north
by
west
and
west
by
north
which
we
afterwards
found
to
be
connected
with
the
cove
a
succession
of
heights
similar
to
the
one
we
were
on
bounded
our
view
between
north
and
miles
in
a
by
east
direction
were
some
detached
round
hills
apparently
the
termination
of
the
high
land
on
which
we
stood
these
appeared
to
rise
out
of
a
plain
of
such
an
extent
in
a
and
easterly
direction
that
i
conceived
it
possible
it
may
have
extended
to
the
rear
of
collier
bay
which
damped
the
interest
we
had
previously
looked
forward
to
in
the
exploration
of
that
part
of
the
coast
as
it
tended
materially
to
weaken
the
probability
of
finding
any
large
opening
there
in
crossing
one
of
the
valleys
in
our
descent
to
the
boats
bynoe
wounded
a
large
kangaroo
we
gave
chase
but
notwithstanding
all
our
efforts
and
at
the
expense
of
many
a
bruise
stumbling
over
the
rugged
ground
the
prize
almost
within
our
grasp
escaped
and
to
add
to
our
misfortune
one
of
the
small
compasses
was
found
missing
the
strap
that
suspended
it
having
given
way
from
this
accident
the
hill
received
its
name
port
usborne
on
our
return
to
the
ship
we
found
usborne
had
discovered
good
anchorage
in
the
cove
we
had
seen
from
the
hill
which
in
commemoration
of
his
providential
recovery
was
called
after
him
port
usborne
march
it
was
a
clear
and
beautiful
morning
and
the
sun
as
it
rose
shed
a
glittering
stream
of
light
over
the
placid
waters
of
the
bay
now
slightly
rippled
by
an
easterly
air
all
were
early
and
busily
engaged
in
moving
the
ship
into
port
usborne
on
our
way
we
crossed
the
inner
edge
of
a
bank
seen
from

in
three
fathoms

south
islet
bore
at
the
time
east
three
and
a
half
miles
after
crossing
this
bank
the
least
water
we
had
was
ten
fathoms
this
depth
we
found
in
passing
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
small
low
island
fronting
port
usborne
a
solitary
overspreading
tree
and
a
white
patch
on
its
eastern
extremity
renders
this
island
conspicuous
and
is
of
this
importance
that
it
guides
a
stranger
to
the
only
safe
anchorage
among
the
islands
on
the
eastern
shore
of
king
sound
as
a
further
guide
to
port
usborne
it
is
situated
at
the
southern
extremity
of
all
these
islands
and
where
the
coast
suddenly
trends
away
to
the
eastward
we
were
delighted
to
find
ourselves
in
an
anchorage
almost
surrounded
by
land
and
although
the
rugged
sandstone
ridges
with
their
dark
mysterious
and
valleys
did
not
give
the
shore
a
very
inviting
appearance
still
the
very
wildness
of
the
scenery
contrasted
pleasingly
in
our
remembrance
with
the
monotonous
level
of
the
country
about
point
torment
and
on
the
banks
of
the
fitzroy
our
present
position
had
also
its
practical
advantages
being
well
adapted
for
carrying
on
the
essential
duties
of
the
survey
for
which
service
the
boats
were
prepared
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
this
snug
little
port
we
found
to
be
of
a
mile
broad
and
one
deep
and
varying
in
depth
from
seven
to
fifteen
fathoms
it
faces
west
the
entrance
points
lying
nearly
north
and
south
of
each
other
and
affords
an
abundant
supply
of
wood
and
water
we
saw
no
traces
of
inhabitants
not
even
the
curling
smoke
that
had
so
often
indicated
their
presence
greeted
the
eye
all
was
silent
and
the
feelings
of
utter
loneliness
were
only
dispelled
by
the
mournful
screams
of
the
curlew
and
occasional
howl
of
the
wild
dog
as
the
deepening
shadows
of
night
closed
in
march
the
boats
were
manned
early
and
we
left
the
ship
with
the
best
wishes
of
the
anxious
group
who
watched
our
departure
and
speculated
with
eager
anticipation
upon
the
probable
result
of
our
enterprise
eastern
shore
of
king
sound
usborne
proceeded
in
one
boat
to
examine
a
group
of
islands
lying
six
miles
from
our
anchorage
tarrant
and
myself
in
the
other
to
explore
the
eastern
shore
of
king
sound
it
was
thus
again
our
good
fortune
to
enjoy
the
exciting
pleasure
of
anticipated
discovery
perchance
again
to
wander
over
the
face
of
a
country
now
the
desert
heritage
of
the
solitary
savage
but
fated
we
hope
to
become
the
abode
of
plenty
and
the
land
of
peace
after
passing
the
extreme
point
of
the
mainland
seen
from
the
ship
we
discovered
a
deep
bay
which
once
reached
would
afford
safe
anchorage
for
a
fleet
near
its
northern
point
a
large
stream
of
water
fell
into
the
sea
in
glittering
cascades
off
this
a
ship
may
anchor
in
twelve
fathoms
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
close
to
the
west
is
a
small
sandy
beach
promising
to
refresh
ourselves
at
this
inviting
stream
we
continued
our
course
to
the
northward
after
passing
a
deep
narrow
channel
trending
by
west
we
met
the
first
rush
of
the
northerly
or
ebb
stream
which
running
at
the
rate
of
six
or
seven
knots
swept
us
through
a
very
small
dangerous
opening
between
some
rocky
islets
and
the
main
a
small
bay
fortunately
afforded
us
the
means
of
avoiding
a
treacherous
ledge
of
sunken
rocks
which
had
the
boat
touched
at
the
almost
giddy
rapidity
we
were
hurried
along
our
destruction
must
have
been
inevitable
landing
to
cook
our
dinners
i
went
to
the
top
of
the
highest
neighbouring
hill
to
obtain
a
round
of
angles
our
journey
was
a
perfect
scramble
the
face
of
the
country
being
intersected
by
deep
ravines
and
covered
with
huge
blocks
of
coarse
sandstone
over
these
we
observed
several
of
the
bounding
with
their
long
bushy
tails
swinging
high
in
the
air
as
if
in
defiance
of
pursuit
the
view
of
the
archipelago
from
this
position
fully
satisfied
me
that
without
incurring
great
risk
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
ship
to
thread
her
way
through
the
numerous
islands
independent
of
shoals
and
shifting
winds
which
form
the
ordinary
perils
of
such
navigation
i
reckoned
more
than
eighty
islands
in
this
portion
of
the
archipelago
alone
cone
bay
after
dinner
we
proceeded
steering
and
crossed
two
deep
bays
the
first
and
the
second
miles
wide
both
affording
good
anchorage
but
utterly
useless
from
the
barrier
of
reefs
and
islets
extending
across
their
mouths
these
bays
and
the
ranges
of
hills
we
passed
trended
to
the
second
and
deepest
we
gave
the
name
of
cone
bay
from
a
singular
hill
of
that
form
on
its
eastern
shore
the
eastern
entrance
of
a
small
tortuous
channel
afforded
us
a
resting
place
for
the
night
having
made
good
miles
in
a
direction
from
the
ship
the
observations
were
made
for
latitude
on
the
south
point
and
gave
a
result
of
degrees
minutes
south
it
was
nearly
dark
when
we
anchored
and
therefore
our
intended
attempt
to
gain
the
summit
of
the
neighbouring
heights
was
necessarily
postponed
till
this
morning
march
when
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
saw
us
struggling
over
the
huge
masses
of
rock
of
which
they
are
composed
the
view
itself
differed
but
little
from
that
obtained
yesterday
except
that
the
islands
are
yet
more
numerous
the
mainland
more
frequently
indented
with
bays
varying
from
two
to
five
miles
in
width
and
invariably
trending
in
the
same
direction
the
long
and
narrow
islands
which
these
bays
contained
generally
subsided
to
the
i
was
fully
occupied
in
sketching
the
surrounding
objects
from
this
station
till
the
tide
had
risen
sufficient
for
us
to
pass
the
channel
after
a
late
breakfast
we
again
bore
away
to
the
under
a
sail
as
the
sky
wore
a
threatening
appearance
after
clearing
the
channel
we
crossed
a
bay
about
two
miles
wide
and
four
deep
thickly
studded
with
small
islands
at
noon
being
near
the
north
point
of
it
i
landed
in
order
to
secure
a
latitude
and
at
the
same
time
a
round
of
angles
having
the
flood
tide
against
us
we
had
only
made
five
miles
in
a
north
by
east
direction
from
last
night
bivouac
native
fires
here
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
the
fitzroy
we
saw
native
fires
one
of
them
was
upon
an
island
eight
or
nine
miles
from
the
main
between
which
however
a
chain
of
smaller
ones
formed
links
of
communication
these
signs
of
inhabitants
gave
us
hopes
of
finding
some
improvement
from
the
almost
utter
sterility
that
had
hitherto
prevailed
among
these
scattered
islands
we
had
as
yet
seen
no
traces
of
either
canoes
or
rafts
and
therefore
were
not
a
little
curious
to
see
what
mode
of
conveyance
the
natives
of
these
parts
used
we
soon
again
moved
onwards
in
a
north
by
east
direction
across
another
large
bay
which
similar
to
the
last
contained
many
islets
it
was
with
great
reluctance
we
pursued
this
northerly
course
as
i
hoped
ere
this
to
have
found
an
opening
leading
to
the
coast
near
collier
bay
but
the
result
of
this
progress
fully
satisfied
me
of
the
improbability
of
any
such
existing
remarkable
headland
the
north
point
of
this
bay
forms
a
most
remarkable
headland
rising
abruptly
from
the
water
to
an
elevation
of
feet
its
cliffy
face
presented
a
grey
and
aged
appearance
which
together
with
the
strange
rocks
scattered
over
its
level
summit
gave
it
the
appearance
of
an
ancient
turreted
fortress
here
i
first
noticed
a
change
in
the
strata
hitherto
it
had
been
invariably
while
from
this
point
as
far
as
our
subsequent
experience
enabled
us
to
decide
it
was
west
i
may
be
pardoned
for
noticing
by
way
of
a
momentary
digression
that
all
the
rocks
hitherto
seen
on
this
part
of
the
coast
precisely
resemble
the
group
forming
the
western
side
of
sunday
strait
the
inclination
and
direction
of
the
strata
are
identical
while
an
examination
of
all
the
high
rocky
portions
of
this
archipelago
will
satisfy
the
geologist
that
they
belong
to
the
same
age
of
the
world
the
history
of
these
coral
reefs
and
islands
which
have
already
attained
something
like
a
majority
if
i
may
use
the
expression
may
be
read
at
least
it
is
apparently
clearly
written
in
the
rising
banks
around
which
are
just
struggling
with
the
tide
before
they
lift
themselves
forever
beyond
its
reach
as
they
rise
the
mangrove
the
pioneer
of
such
fertility
as
the
sea
deposits
hastens
to
maturity
clothing
them
with
its
mantle
of
green
and
thus
bestowing
on
these
barren
reefs
the
presence
of
vegetable
life
whirlpool
channel
our
course
now
lay
along
the
western
foot
of
the
curious
headland
just
described
a
rapid
tide
soon
hurried
us
past
its
frowning
shadows
into
a
very
winding
channel
scarcely
half
a
mile
wide
and
more
than
fathoms
deep
in
this
we
experienced
violent
whirlpools
the
first
of
which
from
want
of
experience
handled
us
very
roughly
suddenly
wrenching
the
oars
out
of
the
men
hands
and
whirling
the
boat
round
with
alarming
rapidity
after
several
round
turns
of
this
kind
we
shot
out
of
the
channel
which
from
the
above
circumstance
we
called
whirlpool
channel
into
a
bay
about
three
miles
wide
trending
east
at
the
head
of
it
were
some
snug
coves
the
shores
of
which
were
clothed
with
long
rich
grass
and
clumps
of
palm
trees
thus
realizing
the
hopes
we
had
entertained
of
finding
a
more
fertile
country
on
first
observing
signs
of
inhabitants
we
would
fain
have
occupied
one
of
these
beautiful
coves
for
the
night
but
as
there
was
still
two
hours
daylight
we
pushed
on
across
the
bay
for
a
group
of
islands
three
miles
further
in
a
direction
we
obtained
snug
quarters
for
the
night
in
a
little
sandy
cove
between
the
largest
of
this
small
cluster
of
isles
which
we
found
to
differ
totally
in
shape
and
character
from
any
yet
seen
they
trended
in
narrow
ridges
and
were
of
a
grey
slate
formation
their
eastern
sides
formed
steep
precipices
while
the
western
subsided
to
the
water
in
rich
grassy
slopes
leaving
quite
a
serrated
ridge
on
their
summits
bathurst
island
we
managed
to
reach
the
most
elevated
part
of
the
highest
island
by
crawling
along
its
ridge
on
our
hands
and
knees
from
this
station
i
recognized
the
islands
to
the
to
be
those
forming
the
eastern
shore
of
sunday
strait
and
from
the
westerly
trend
of
some
larger
ones
bearing
about
eight
miles
i
rightly
supposed
them
to
be
the
same
captain
king
had
laid
down
off
that
part
of
the
coast
where
it
trends
away
to
the
eastward
into
collier
bay
the
largest
of
these
i
in
consequence
named
bathurst
island
after
his
vessel
we
were
glad
to
find
the
islands
becoming
less
numerous
and
a
prospect
of
at
last
making
our
way
to
the
eastward
we
just
finished
our
observations
as
the
bright
orb
touched
the
distant
horizon
and
ere
we
reached
the
boat
the
last
vestige
of
day
had
taken
its
silent
flight
our
present
position
in
this
network
of
islands
will
be
better
described
by
giving
it
in
latitude
and
longitude
which
we
found
to
be
degrees
minutes
south
and
degrees
minutes
east
we
had
as
usual
a
fine
night
with
a
light
breeze
which
had
succeeded
a
strong
one
from
during
the
day
march
daylight
found
us
running
before
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
in
a
direction
crossing
the
mouths
of
small
bays
four
miles
brought
us
to
the
extreme
of
the
mainland
the
shores
of
which
we
followed
for
two
miles
in
a
and
one
in
an
east
half
south
direction
when
we
came
to
a
small
sandy
bay
where
we
landed
to
search
in
a
promising
ravine
for
water
this
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
almost
immediately
whilst
the
breakers
were
filling
tarrant
and
myself
ascended
a
hill
near
for
a
few
angles
appearance
of
the
country
the
country
again
presented
a
barren
appearance
large
masses
of
coarse
sandstone
lay
scattered
over
the
face
of
it
a
wiry
grass
with
a
few
stunted
growing
in
the
ravines
were
all
the
vegetation
this
point
boasted
of
and
from
what
we
saw
of
the
interior
it
appeared
scarcely
more
inviting
the
sterility
however
which
apparently
prevailed
over
this
part
of
australia
could
not
obliterate
those
feelings
of
deep
interest
which
must
pervade
everyone
as
the
eye
wanders
for
the
first
time
over
a
country
hitherto
unknown
visited
by
a
native
we
had
just
completed
our
surveying
operations
when
two
of
the
crew
came
to
report
a
visit
from
one
of
the
natives
and
concluding
others
were
at
hand
hastened
up
to
strengthen
our
party
they
said
their
sable
visitor
came
to
them
without
any
enticing
no
offers
of
red
or
blue
handkerchiefs
or
some
gaudy
bauble
that
seldom
fails
to
catch
the
eye
of
a
savage
and
without
the
slightest
indication
of
fear
we
hurried
down
to
see
this
marvellously
confiding
native
who
we
found
coming
up
the
hill
he
met
us
with
all
the
confidence
of
an
old
acquaintance
his
first
act
of
civility
was
to
show
tarrant
and
myself
an
easy
road
to
the
beach
and
i
shall
never
forget
as
he
preceded
us
or
rather
walked
by
our
side
yielding
the
path
with
natural
politeness
to
those
he
seemed
to
regard
as
his
guests
how
wonderful
was
the
agility
he
displayed
in
passing
over
the
rocks
sometimes
coming
down
the
face
of
one
almost
precipitous
without
the
least
apparent
effort
when
i
pointed
to
the
fresh
water
he
said
slowly
and
distinctly
yampee
yampee
in
height
he
was
about
feet
inches
his
hair
bore
no
symptoms
of
being
tied
up
behind
a
custom
we
always
before
noticed
his
teeth
were
also
perfect
and
though
his
brow
had
the
distinctive
peculiarity
of
the
people
of
this
continent
his
forehead
was
remarkably
high
his
perception
was
very
quick
his
utterance
gentle
and
slow
both
in
articulation
and
by
signs
not
flinging
his
arms
about
in
the
fashion
customary
with
those
we
had
before
seen
his
manner
of
conversation
afforded
a
most
pleasing
contrast
to
that
of
the
natives
hitherto
seen
and
altogether
i
was
exceedingly
prepossessed
in
his
favour
we
very
much
regretted
that
we
were
not
better
provided
with
presents
for
him
particularly
as
it
seldom
happened
that
i
was
without
a
supply
for
such
occasions
in
this
case
however
all
i
could
give
him
consisted
of
a
few
beads
and
some
biscuit
which
he
devoured
most
readily
nor
ought
the
perfect
confidence
this
man
manifested
in
thus
trusting
himself
alone
and
unarmed
among
such
extraordinary
strangers
to
be
passed
over
unnoticed
it
commanded
respect
from
us
all
his
conduct
too
was
in
the
same
spirit
when
we
parted
from
him
though
then
i
admit
it
almost
as
much
disappointed
as
astonished
me
when
the
boat
left
the
shore
he
turned
to
ascend
the
beach
and
without
once
looking
back
walked
as
unconcernedly
and
listlessly
away
as
though
such
things
were
to
him
everyday
sights
native
habits
this
want
of
curiosity
is
a
very
singular
and
i
believe
an
almost
distinctive
feature
in
the
character
of
the
native
australian
among
all
other
savages
of
whom
i
have
read
or
among
whom
i
have
had
any
opportunity
of
judging
for
myself
except
the
inhabitants
of
tierra
del
fuego
a
perpetual
and
never
satisfied
curiosity
seems
to
be
the
leading
habit
of
their
minds
here
however
wonder
is
rarely
expressed
curiosity
seldom
apparent
yet
their
indifference
is
not
stupidity
or
their
simplicity
cunning
bathurst
island
we
had
now
been
sufficiently
long
in
australia
to
know
the
value
of
a
stream
of
water
and
therefore
always
felt
the
necessity
of
particularizing
the
locality
of
any
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
from
this
one
the
extremes
of
bathurst
island
bore
and
we
now
pulled
for
the
opening
on
the
east
side
of
bathurst
island
but
finding
the
setting
so
strong
through
it
from
the
northward
i
found
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
to
contend
with
it
and
therefore
proceeded
to
a
hill
on
the
east
end
of
bathurst
island
a
large
flock
of
white
cockatoos
screamed
violently
as
if
wishing
to
dispute
our
landing
and
it
was
not
till
their
numbers
had
been
thinned
of
which
our
evening
meal
felt
the
benefit
that
we
could
get
any
peace
we
reached
the
summit
of
the
island
by
following
up
a
ravine
which
formed
the
only
break
in
the
cliffs
that
faced
the
side
of
the
island
there
was
a
thick
growth
of
red
gums
and
the
papyrus
on
its
sides
and
near
the
summit
we
found
rocks
containing
iron
a
vein
of
the
same
vitrified
matter
i
have
described
as
seen
at
swan
point
separated
it
from
the
prevailing
rock
of
the
island
which
was
composed
of
sandstone
and
fragments
of
quartz
the
rocks
containing
metal
had
a
strange
appearance
being
heaped
together
in
the
form
of
a
whirlpool
the
ground
beneath
appeared
quite
hollow
our
view
was
very
commanding
and
fully
repaid
us
for
the
scramble
up
there
was
a
clear
sea
to
the
and
bearing
were
some
small
islands
which
i
afterwards
found
to
be
situated
near
the
depth
of
collier
bay
the
macleay
isles
of
captain
king
bore
about
six
miles
between
the
latter
and
a
group
farther
west
there
was
a
clear
wide
channel
which
appeared
to
lead
between
the
island
we
were
on
and
the
next
to
the
westward
as
this
was
the
first
part
of
the
coast
since
leaving
port
usborne
that
a
sailing
vessel
could
approach
without
great
risk
we
proceeded
to
examine
that
channel
more
minutely
and
were
sorry
to
find
the
extensive
coral
reefs
which
fronted
the
islands
left
a
space
of
only
half
a
mile
between
a
black
pointed
rock
ten
feet
above
marks
the
edge
of
the
western
reef
where
it
is
covered
by
the
tide
keeping
this
close
on
the
starboard
hand
will
conduct
a
ship
into
good
anchorage
in
and
fathoms
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
tide
at
this
place
we
found
to
be
feet
native
habitations
as
we
required
another
station
on
the
west
end
of
bathurst
island
i
arranged
that
we
should
pass
the
night
in
a
small
cove
near
its
extreme
here
we
found
several
native
habitations
of
a
totally
different
and
very
superior
description
to
any
we
had
hitherto
seen
in
any
part
of
australia
they
bore
a
marked
resemblance
to
those
i
had
seen
on
the
coast
of
tierra
del
fuego
which
was
so
striking
as
to
be
remarked
even
by
some
of
the
boat
crew
who
had
belonged
to
the
beagle
in
her
wanderings
on
that
stormy
coast
stout
poles
from
to
feet
high
formed
the
framework
of
these
snug
huts
for
so
indeed
they
deserve
to
be
termed
these
were
brought
together
conically
at
the
roof
a
stout
thatching
of
dried
grass
completely
excluded
both
wind
and
rain
and
seemed
to
bespeak
the
existence
of
a
climate
at
times
much
more
severe
than
a
latitude
of
degrees
minutes
south
would
lead
one
to
anticipate
the
remains
of
small
fires
a
well
greased
bark
pillow
a
head
ornament
of
feathers
together
with
several
other
trifling
articles
strewn
upon
the
floors
of
these
wigwams
proved
that
they
had
been
very
recently
inhabited
native
raft
but
perhaps
the
most
interesting
discovery
in
this
bay
was
a
native
raft
which
we
found
near
the
beach
in
such
a
position
as
must
have
required
the
exertions
of
several
men
to
have
placed
it
there
being
heavier
than
either
of
our
boats
in
the
construction
of
this
raft
almost
everything
had
been
left
to
nature
it
was
framed
of
the
dead
trunk
of
a
mangrove
tree
with
three
distinct
stems
growing
from
one
root
about
feet
long
and
broad
the
roots
at
one
end
closely
entwined
as
is
the
habit
of
the
tree
formed
a
sufficient
bulwark
at
the
stem
while
an
elbow
in
the
centre
of
the
trunk
served
the
same
purpose
at
the
stern
a
platform
of
small
poles
well
covered
with
dried
grass
gave
a
sufficient
flooring
to
this
rude
specimen
of
a
raft
i
could
not
survey
it
without
allowing
my
thoughts
to
carry
me
away
in
pleasing
reflections
upon
the
gradual
progress
of
human
ingenuity
by
the
advance
of
which
the
same
intellect
that
first
contents
itself
with
the
mere
floating
of
the
single
tree
at
length
shapes
a
forest
into
timbers
and
launches
the
floating
fortress
in
triumph
on
the
deep
return
to
port
usborne
we
were
now
about
miles
in
a
direct
line
from
port
usborne
and
perhaps
by
the
winding
course
we
were
obliged
to
follow
only
two
days
provisions
remained
and
as
we
were
still
deficient
of
material
for
the
chart
of
this
archipelago
i
was
reluctantly
obliged
to
abandon
the
idea
of
attempting
to
reach
collier
bay
the
mainland
we
had
explored
since
leaving
port
usborne
may
be
described
as
forming
eight
bays
varying
in
depth
from
three
to
eight
miles
and
in
width
from
two
to
five
their
general
trend
is
many
islets
skirt
their
shores
and
almost
more
than
can
be
counted
fill
their
mouths
march
with
the
first
grey
of
the
morning
we
left
bathurst
island
on
our
return
to
the
southward
whilst
passing
inside
the
cluster
of
isles
of
slate
formation
we
heard
a
halloa
and
on
looking
in
the
direction
from
whence
it
proceeded
a
native
was
observed
on
a
raft
the
boat
course
was
immediately
altered
so
as
to
cut
him
off
should
he
attempt
to
escape
but
to
my
great
surprise
he
paddled
towards
us
with
all
possible
haste
the
native
yampee
he
was
soon
alongside
and
with
great
satisfaction
we
at
once
recognized
our
strange
friend
of
yesterday
who
amongst
the
boat
crew
went
by
the
sobriquet
of
yampee
he
again
made
use
of
the
word
yampee
according
to
our
orthography
and
after
repeating
it
several
times
i
offered
him
some
water
which
he
very
eagerly
accepted
twice
emptying
a
canister
that
had
originally
held
pounds
of
preserved
meat
this
afforded
me
additional
proof
of
yampee
being
the
word
the
natives
of
these
parts
use
for
water
at
swan
river
the
native
name
for
water
is
which
differs
so
much
as
to
lead
us
to
suppose
the
dialect
of
the
two
places
is
quite
distinct
this
supposition
is
also
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
miago
the
native
of
swan
river
we
had
on
board
could
never
understand
the
language
spoken
by
his
countrymen
on
the
western
shore
of
king
sound
we
found
our
new
acquaintance
as
yesterday
perfectly
naked
the
raft
he
was
on
was
in
every
respect
similar
to
that
previously
seen
upon
roe
group
with
this
slight
exception
that
between
each
pole
several
small
pieces
of
wood
were
inserted
so
as
to
make
the
flooring
of
the
raft
almost
smooth
into
the
large
end
of
the
centre
and
largest
pole
six
long
pegs
were
driven
forming
a
kind
of
basket
in
which
were
secured
his
means
for
procuring
fire
they
consisted
of
two
pieces
of
white
flint
and
some
tinder
rudely
manufactured
from
the
inner
bark
of
the
papyrus
tree
he
used
in
paddling
a
short
spear
sharp
at
each
end
and
struck
the
water
alternately
on
either
side
in
this
primitive
manner
he
contrived
to
make
way
with
a
rapidity
that
astonished
us
all
he
had
two
spears
on
the
raft
besides
the
one
he
used
for
paddling
one
of
them
was
about
feet
long
also
pointed
at
each
end
though
not
barbed
and
a
small
stick
similar
to
that
used
by
other
natives
for
throwing
at
birds
and
small
animals
as
well
as
we
could
understand
by
his
signs
it
appeared
that
he
had
been
anxiously
waiting
our
arrival
and
had
pushed
off
from
the
main
to
intercept
the
boat
on
our
leaving
bathurst
island
we
threw
him
a
line
and
he
immediately
comprehended
our
intention
and
its
use
by
at
once
making
fast
to
the
raft
an
instance
of
confident
reliance
upon
our
good
intentions
which
reflected
much
credit
upon
the
unsuspicious
openness
of
his
own
character
and
which
i
should
have
exceedingly
regretted
by
any
act
of
ours
to
abuse
parting
with
the
native
had
not
the
distance
and
our
scant
supply
of
food
rendered
such
a
step
imprudent
i
should
have
been
very
glad
to
have
towed
him
to
the
ship
i
really
believe
he
would
have
trusted
himself
with
us
for
that
or
a
much
longer
distance
but
this
could
not
be
and
therefore
after
endeavouring
to
make
him
understand
that
we
should
sleep
some
distance
to
the
south
where
there
was
a
larger
boat
alluding
to
the
ship
we
filled
his
basket
with
bread
gave
him
as
much
water
as
he
could
drink
and
bidding
him
farewell
reluctantly
cut
him
adrift
i
shall
not
soon
forget
the
sorrowful
expression
of
his
countenance
when
this
apparently
inhospitable
act
was
performed
it
did
not
seem
however
to
quench
his
regard
for
his
new
friends
for
so
long
as
we
could
see
him
he
was
hard
at
work
paddling
in
our
wake
i
noticed
that
the
beads
given
him
yesterday
were
gone
this
fact
coupled
with
the
smokes
seen
during
the
day
satisfied
me
that
he
had
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
to
whom
i
hoped
he
would
report
favourably
of
his
new
acquaintances
we
had
certainly
endeavoured
to
obtain
his
goodwill
trusting
savage
farewell
native
spears
the
woodcut
represents
the
difference
between
the
spear
used
by
the
natives
of
this
district
and
those
of
swan
river
we
soon
reached
whirlpool
channel
through
which
the
tide
again
hurried
and
whirled
us
with
almost
frightful
rapidity
we
were
in
one
part
of
it
shot
down
a
fall
of
several
feet
the
boat
bow
being
fairly
buried
in
the
boiling
current
emerging
from
this
channel
the
hoary
face
of
the
remarkable
headland
already
described
burst
on
our
view
and
as
it
was
necessary
if
possible
to
reach
its
summit
we
landed
in
a
small
bay
near
the
southern
extremity
by
following
a
winding
ravine
we
gained
the
crest
of
this
singular
platform
which
we
found
formed
of
a
sandstone
with
some
beautiful
specimens
of
crystallised
quartz
on
its
higher
parts
over
which
was
a
slight
sprinkling
of
vegetation
consisting
of
a
few
small
gumtrees
and
patches
of
coarse
grass
the
weather
was
unusually
cloudy
with
squalls
from
the
towards
the
evening
it
was
fine
with
a
moderate
breeze
from
as
it
was
late
when
we
reached
the
boat
we
spent
the
night
where
we
landed
march
we
were
early
on
the
move
pursuing
our
southerly
course
the
morning
being
rather
gloomy
with
a
fresh
wind
which
raised
a
good
deal
of
sea
in
the
mouths
of
the
larger
bays
as
the
day
closed
we
reached
a
cove
half
a
mile
north
of
point
where
we
passed
the
night
march
this
morning
the
thermometer
was
down
to
degrees
at
daylight
which
gave
us
the
novel
sensation
of
cold
it
was
late
in
the
forenoon
before
the
violent
ripplings
at
point
had
subsided
sufficiently
to
allow
of
our
passing
it
the
rate
of
the
current
at
this
point
appeared
at
times
scarcely
less
than
eight
knots
per
hour
and
traversing
a
rocky
ledge
extending
to
some
islands
and
nearly
dry
at
rendered
it
almost
impassable
except
when
nearly
high
tide
cascade
bay
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
the
cascade
discovered
on
our
way
to
the
northward
and
from
which
the
bay
within
which
it
is
received
its
name
we
spent
an
hour
or
two
luxuriating
in
the
thorough
enjoyment
of
a
treat
so
rare
as
this
beautiful
stream
must
be
considered
in
australia
in
the
evening
we
continued
our
return
to
port
usborne
by
a
channel
leading
from
the
bottom
of
cascade
bay
into
the
large
sheet
of
water
first
seen
from
compass
hill
our
progress
was
arrested
at
its
inner
entrance
by
the
violence
with
which
the
tide
rushed
through
and
we
were
therefore
obliged
to
pass
another
night
in
the
boats
return
of
the
boats
march
we
reached
the
ship
this
morning
entering
port
usborne
by
a
narrow
rocky
channel
on
its
shore
on
the
precipitous
sides
in
this
passage
we
noticed
several
of
the
rock
kangaroo
we
found
that
usborne
had
returned
three
days
before
us
from
his
account
of
the
islands
he
had
visited
they
appear
to
have
the
same
sterile
character
as
most
of
those
we
had
seen
in
other
respects
his
trip
was
void
of
interest
beyond
that
of
surveying
during
the
absence
of
the
boats
tidal
and
magnetic
observations
had
been
made
some
specimens
in
natural
history
had
been
collected
and
all
that
could
in
any
way
add
to
the
interest
of
the
expedition
had
been
as
well
attended
to
as
the
means
placed
at
our
disposal
would
allow
we
closed
at
port
usborne
our
explorations
in
king
sound
the
result
of
which
enabled
us
to
fill
up
the
gap
long
existing
in
the
charts
of
the
coast
of
australia
and
which
had
for
years
been
the
theme
of
much
ingenious
geographical
speculation
the
result
of
our
labours
if
it
had
been
less
brilliant
than
eager
anticipation
at
the
onset
led
us
to
hope
for
had
nevertheless
been
on
the
whole
satisfactory
the
river
fitzroy
although
not
of
the
magnitude
that
we
hoped
to
find
was
still
an
undoubtedly
valuable
acquisition
to
our
stock
of
geographical
knowledge
and
offered
a
way
of
access
into
the
interior
of
which
we
had
availed
ourselves
to
the
extent
of
miles
and
which
subsequent
explorers
might
yet
further
improve
while
in
many
minor
yet
important
matters
much
had
been
done
and
much
seen
to
more
than
compensate
for
the
disappointments
and
annoyances
inseparable
from
the
pursuits
of
the
adventurer
leaving
port
usborne
march
the
morning
was
unusually
stormy
dark
clouds
rested
upon
the
adjacent
high
land
while
others
no
less
portentous
hurried
past
us
on
the
wings
of
the
tempest
soon
after
breakfast
we
bade
adieu
to
the
wild
scenery
of
port
usborne
and
stood
across
the
sound
for
our
old
anchorage
on
the
north
side
of
point
cunningham
distant
one
and
twenty
miles
in
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
we
passed
over
a
coral
knoll
having
five
fathoms
on
it
we
did
not
however
reach
our
destination
till
nearly
having
been
taken
some
distance
up
the
sound
by
the
our
soundings
in
crossing
varied
from
fifteen
to
twenty
fathoms
chiefly
over
rocky
ground
it
rained
almost
all
the
day
and
we
had
several
sudden
shifts
of
wind
from
to
our
first
view
of
the
western
shore
of
the
sound
was
singular
point
cunningham
and
carlisle
head
appeared
like
two
high
islands
we
anchored
soon
after
which
appeared
to
be
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
than
at
port
usborne
we
remained
at
this
anchorage
till
the
of
april
during
which
time
several
unsuccessful
hauls
were
made
with
the
seine
but
some
additions
were
made
to
the
collection
of
natural
history
particularly
in
the
ornithological
branch
it
is
not
a
little
remarkable
that
fish
should
be
so
scarce
on
this
part
of
the
coast
a
fact
also
noticed
by
captain
king
interview
with
natives
april
this
morning
five
natives
made
their
appearance
on
the
beach
captain
wickham
and
myself
went
on
shore
in
order
if
possible
to
induce
them
to
visit
the
ship
on
landing
he
recognised
them
for
old
acquaintances
and
i
gave
the
eldest
of
the
party
a
handkerchief
upon
which
he
seemed
to
have
set
his
affections
however
when
he
understood
our
wish
for
the
company
of
himself
and
friends
on
board
he
was
with
difficulty
induced
to
retain
it
none
but
those
who
have
made
the
experiment
are
aware
of
what
has
to
be
overcome
before
any
sort
of
intercourse
can
be
carried
on
by
signs
or
how
often
among
the
most
intelligent
the
greatest
mistakes
must
of
necessity
occur
i
have
since
thought
remembering
what
passed
during
this
interview
that
while
we
were
making
signs
to
them
that
on
board
they
would
find
something
to
eat
each
man
fears
suggested
the
probability
of
a
certain
convocation
not
where
he
eats
but
where
he
is
eaten
and
induced
him
to
decline
standing
treat
upon
the
occasion
the
singular
manner
these
men
had
also
of
holding
the
face
turned
upwards
in
order
to
escape
the
plague
of
flies
fully
confirmed
the
truth
of
old
dampier
account
of
the
manners
of
these
people
when
he
first
discovered
this
part
of
the
world
the
eldest
was
the
spokesman
or
rather
the
signsman
of
the
party
and
this
is
always
the
custom
so
far
as
we
have
had
an
opportunity
of
judging
the
word
they
make
use
of
in
bowing
which
they
did
quite
in
an
eastern
style
appeared
to
be
irru
irru
their
breasts
were
scarred
with
deep
horizontal
cuts
such
as
we
had
previously
noticed
on
the
natives
in
roebuck
bay
i
was
so
much
struck
with
the
resemblance
between
these
people
and
the
natives
of
tierra
del
fuego
that
i
have
been
tempted
to
believe
that
the
stream
of
population
flowed
thitherward
from
the
continent
of
america
i
ought
to
mention
that
when
captain
wickham
and
myself
left
the
ship
in
the
hope
of
inducing
the
natives
to
return
with
us
miago
hearing
of
the
expected
visit
immediately
went
below
and
dressed
himself
to
the
best
possible
advantage
no
sooner
did
the
boat
come
alongside
than
he
appeared
at
the
gangway
inquiring
with
the
utmost
possible
dignity
where
blackfellas
and
was
evidently
and
deeply
mortified
that
he
had
no
opportunity
of
astonishing
the
natives
there
has
been
a
marked
change
in
the
weather
since
the
sun
crossed
the
equator
we
have
had
no
repetitions
of
the
easterly
squalls
before
so
prevalent
and
the
winds
have
been
almost
regular
in
the
following
order
from
to
a
light
breeze
from
which
freshening
alters
to
where
it
remains
till
from
that
hour
gradually
decreasing
and
at
the
same
time
changing
to
and
north
the
thermometer
for
some
days
past
has
ranged
from
to
degrees
a
temperature
which
we
thought
a
few
months
ago
intolerable
was
now
quite
agreeable
we
looked
forward
with
the
utmost
anxiety
to
the
result
of
our
arrival
at
port
george
the
fourth
as
there
or
at
least
in
that
neighbourhood
we
hoped
to
hear
some
tidings
of
our
friends
grey
and
lushington
who
when
we
separated
from
them
at
the
cape
intended
to
land
in
hanover
bay
establish
a
depot
for
stores
and
from
thence
penetrate
if
possible
into
the
interior
their
peaceable
disposition
i
had
no
fear
on
the
subject
of
any
hostility
from
the
natives
for
in
our
own
experience
we
had
as
yet
always
found
them
inoffensive
and
peaceable
while
should
they
prove
otherwise
i
was
satisfied
that
a
very
slight
acquaintance
with
the
effects
of
gunpowder
would
be
quite
sufficient
to
quell
their
warlike
propensities
but
i
did
fear
that
they
had
chosen
a
very
unfavourable
point
for
debarkation
and
that
many
causes
would
combine
to
arrest
their
progress
into
the
interior
how
unhappily
my
anticipations
were
verified
will
be
seen
hereafter
early
on
the
morning
of
the
we
left
our
anchorage
under
point
cunningham
and
by
two
had
worked
through
sunday
strait
where
we
encountered
its
usual
heavy
at
four
in
the
afternoon
caffarelli
island
bore
miles
distant
and
about
six
the
wind
which
through
the
day
had
been
light
and
variable
quite
deserted
us
when
to
avoid
drifting
back
into
the
strait
we
anchored
in
fathoms
caffarelli
island
bearing
miles
the
tide

appeared
to
be
one
hour
earlier
than
in

flood
set
in
a

the
ebb
in
an
opposite
direction
at
the
rate
of
from
half
to
one
mile
per
hour
the
saw
us
again
underweigh
by
the
light
of
the
stars
but
the
wind
being
variable
and
against
us
we
did
not
get
beyond
adele
island
where
we
anchored
in
fathoms
the
nearest
part
of
it
bearing
north
degrees
east
miles
adele
island
brue
reef
was
seen
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
appeared
to
be
correctly
laid
down
by
captain
king
there
appeared
however
some
discrepancy
in
the
position
of
adele
island
the
southern
extremity
of
which
we
found
to
be
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
seconds
south
which
is
one
mile
and
a
half
to
the
southward
of
the
place
assigned
to
it
in
his
chart
the
sea
was
breaking
heavily
on
the
reef
which
fronts
the
island
for
a
distance
of
two
miles
the
island
itself
is
low
desolate
and
barren
we
noticed
there
was
scarcely
any
set
of
tide
at
this
anchorage
during
the
day
progress
we
found
several
coral
ledges
in
from
to
fathoms
and
trending
by
east
and
with
from
to
fathoms
between
them
the
specimens
of
this
beautiful
submarine
production
brought
up
by
the
lead
were
of
the
most
delicate
kind
nor
on
any
occasion
did
the
lead
present
any
appearance
to
indicate
that
it
had
fallen
among
a
coarser
sort
one
beautiful
fragment
was
obtained
in

standing
to

a
light
northerly

ranging
from

and
over
a
bottom
of
white
and
brown
sand
in
the
deep
and
coral
rock
in
the
shoal
water
in
the
afternoon
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
discover
one
of
the
reefs
which
render
the
navigation
of
this
part
of
the
coast
rather
hazardous
the
position
of
this
danger
is
however
well
marked
by
a
bank
of
very
white
sand
and
dead
coral
from
which
the
reef
extends
two
miles
and
a
half
in
a
and
one
mile
in
a
direction
and
which
rising
some
feet
above
the
mean
level
of
the
blue
surrounding
water
became
a
conspicuous
object
from
our
deck
even
at
the
distance
of
six
miles
we
gave
our
discovery
the
name
of
beagle
bank
as
another
memorial
of
the
useful
services
in
which
our
little
vessel
had
been
so
frequently
engaged
and
our
observations
enabled
us
to
fix
the
centre
of

never
exceeded

the

changed

time
the

was
therefore
two
hours
later
here
than
in

entrance
to

which
it
would
appear
that

made
slight
progress
towards
port
george
the
fourth
during
the
forenoon
the
water
deepening
to
and
fathoms
soon
after
we
had
weighed
we
espied
a
ridge
extending
to
the
from
beagle
bank
which
supplies
another
fact
in
support
of
the
opinion
i
have
before
advanced
and
which
gives
a
trend
to
these
ledges
the
wind
failing
and
the
drifting
us
again
to
the
westward
in
sight
of
beagle
bank
the
anchor
was
dropped
miles
east
by
north
of
it
and
in
a
depth
of
fathoms
to

we
had
suddenly
shoaled
from

position
marked
the
limit
of
shoal
soundings
in
an

direction
from
beagle
bank
between
sunset
and
midnight
we
were
able
to
make
miles
in
an
east
by
north
direction
when
a
contrary
tide
and
an
accompanying
calm
compelled
us
to
anchor
in
fathoms

soundings
during
the
run
had
varied
from
to
fathoms
the
bottom
latterly
a
soft
mud
of
a
dirty

placed
our
position
miles
west
of

corresponded
with
the

were

to
our
recollection
captain
heywood
by
whom
this

australian

had
been
seen

whose
earlier
career
a
notice
will
be
found

during
the
entire
day
ranged
from
to
fathoms
and
the
character
of
the
bottom
was
similar
to
that
last
described
our
observations
for
latitude
did
not
verify
our
position
by
the
chart
though
all
its
bearings
and
distances
appeared
relatively
correct
the
discrepancy
may
perhaps
be
ascribed
to
the
effect
of
refraction
as
we
were
prevented
by
the
land
from
observing
on
both
horizons
the
most
remarkable
objects
in
this
neighbourhood
were
two
hills
named
by
captain
king
mount
trafalgar
and
mount
waterloo
to
record
in
one
hemisphere
two
memorable
events
not
likely
to
be
easily
forgotten
in
the
other
although
assuredly
the
time
will
come
when
the
peaceful
triumphs
of
science
and
civilization
of
which
these
names
are
here
enduring
witnesses
will
be
far
more
highly
valued
and
far
more
truly
honoured
mount
trafalgar
made
its
first
appearance
in
the
form
of
a
huge
quoin
or
wedge
resting
longitudinally
upon
the
horizon
with
its
point
towards
the
among
other
memoranda
for
the
improvement
of
the
chart
of
this
coast
it
should
be
noted
that
the
reef
extending
to
the
from
peaked
island
appears
to
join
the
small
islands
lying
near
it
in
that
direction
and
to
which
from
their
colour
we
gave
the
name
of
the
brown
islands
the
brown
islands
as
there
was
every
probability
of
the
ship
being
detained
in
this
neighbourhood
for
some
days
searching
for
traces
of

party
and
as
the
examination
of
collier
bay
where
we
still
hoped
to
find
an
opening
leading
into
the
interior
would
prevent
the
necessity
of
our
return
to
this
part
of
the
coast
i
applied
to
captain
wickham
for
permission
to
proceed
with
the
two
whaleboats

that
service
a
wound
on

foot
had
in
some
degree
unfitted
me
for
any
very
active
duty

i
felt
satisfied

i
might
have

not
to

neglected

by

the

had
left

were
standing
to

party
consisted
of

passing
through
the
eastern
part
of

george
the
fourth
we
entered
roger
strait
which
led
into
a
large
sheet
of
water
forming
a
beautiful
harbour
we
landed
to
obtain
a
better
view
of
it
on
a
small
island
at
the
southern
entrance
of
this
strait
this
islet
looked
truly
inviting
being
clothed
with
long
rich
grass
which
to
our
cost
we
found
concealed
boulders
of
granite
this
was
the
first
time
we
met
with
this
primitive
rock
and
from
the
colour
of
the
surrounding
heights
it
was
evident
we
were
in
an
old
red
sandstone
region
strange
to
say
the
attraction
on
this
island
rendered
our
compasses
quite
useless
we
noticed
on
its
side
a
portion
of
the
wreck
of
a
small
vessel
there
was
a
small
mangrove
inlet
in
the
corner
of
this
harbour
over
which
the
land
was
low
forming
a
gap
in
the
neighbouring
heights
we
now
pushed
on
for
an
island
lying
in
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
bearing
west
by
north
miles
our
soundings
in
passing
over

called

a
west
direction
from
the
north
point
of
the
harbour
both
these
and
entrance
isle
escaped
captain
notice
owing
to
the
distant
view
he
had
of
this
part
of
the
coast
a
point
bearing
distant
miles
was
the
extreme
of
the
mainland
that
we
could
see
in
the
direction
we
were
going
we
found
the
sandstone
of
this
island
not
of
the
same
ancient
red
colour
as
that
on
the
shore
fronting
it
one
boat
was
employed
in
the
meantime
sounding
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
which
we
found
to
be
miles
across
and
from
to
fathoms
deep
the
mouth
of
it
faces
the
entrance
isle
lying
half
a
mile
outside
its
points
with
a
clear
channel
nearly
a
mile
wide
on
either
side
of
it
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
the
main
and
fronting
the
south
side
of
this
island
there
is
a
singular
rock
feet
high
marking
the
outer
extreme
of
a
coral
ledge
which
is
covered
at
as
it
now
blew
a
fresh
breeze
from
seaward
and
the
afternoon
was
far
advanced
we
spent
the
remainder
of
the
day
in
a
further
examination
of
the
entrance
we
were
much
pleased
with
the
result
of
our
evening
work
finding
the
approach
to
this
fine
harbour
quite
free
from
danger
and
capable
of
admitting
vessels
of
any
size
there
were
no
reefs
or
islets
seaward
of
it
to
add
to
the
anxiety
of
the
navigator
or
lessen
the
value
of
our
discovery
the
importance
of
which
will
be
greatly
enhanced
should
lieutenants
grey
and
lushington
have
the
good
fortune
to
discover
any
land
fit
for
colonization
in
its
neighbourhood
our
labours
here
closed
with
observations
for
a
boat
rate
for
the
chronometers
and
latitude
the
latter
being
degrees
minutes
south
on
a
sandy
beach
at
the
eastern
side
of
entrance
isle
slate
islands
april
we
rounded
the
extreme
point
to
the
seen
from
entrance
isle
at
sunrise
the
rocks
on
this
point
were
arranged
quite
in
the
form
of
a
fort
from
whence
it
received
the
name
of
battery
point
another
group
of
islands
now
came
in
view
bearing
from
battery
point
by
south
about
miles
these
we
named
slate
islands
from
their
singular
formation
they
extended
one
mile
from
a
point
of
land
between
them
and
battery
point
the
coast
fell
back
forming
two
bays
crossing
the
mouths
of
which
we
had
fathoms
on
passing
slate
islands
we
saw
a
headland
named
by
captain
king
point
hall
bearing
south
by
west
west
distant
miles
it
has
a
high
peaked
and
isolated
appearance
being
separated
from
the
contiguous
high
land
by
a
low
neck
we
passed
a
bay
miles
wide
on
its
and
a
snug
cove
on
its
side
it
was
past
noon
and
we
were
glad
to
see
the
stagnant
calm
that
had
for
hours
reigned
around
dispelled
by
the
seabreeze
which
now
darkened
the
horizon
our
course
during
the
afternoon
was
south
by
east
along
a
low
rocky
coast
but
as
we
had
to
contend
with
a
tide
we
did
not
get
farther
than
a
small
sandy
cove
bearing
south
by
east
miles
from
point
hall
by
the
close
of
the
day
which
was
the
only
spot
we
had
seen
the
whole
of
the
afternoon
capable
of
affording
shelter
for
the
boats
freshwater
cove
we
were
agreeably
surprised
to
find
a
stream
of
water
running
into
the
head
of
this
cove
as
the
parched
appearance
of
the
low
hills
over
it
did
not
lead
us
to
expect
such
good
luck
in
remembrance
of
which
we
called
it
freshwater
cove
landing
i
hastened
to
the
south
point
of
the
cove
to
secure
the
necessary
data
for
the
chart
before
the
surrounding
objects
were
veiled
in
darkness
we
again
appeared
to
be
in
a
sterile
white
sandstone
region
where
with
the
exception
of
a
few
land
birds
there
was
a
total
absence
of
animal
life
and
almost
that
of
the
vegetable
for
even
the
gumtrees
common
in
this
part
were
not
to
be
seen
our
view
to
the
southward
was
very
limited
embracing
only
the
montgomery
islands
of
captain
king
they
consist
of
six
small
rocky
islets
resting
on
an
extensive
coral
flat
that
we
afterwards
observed
to
be
dry
at
and
which
extended
to
a
large
low
sandy
island
lying
six
miles
west
from
them
the
latter
was
not
seen
by
captain
king
in
his
distant
view
of
this
neighbourhood
the
eastern
and
largest
of
the
montgomery
isles
stands
on
the
extreme
of
the
coral
flat
we
found
it
to
be
feet
high
and
bore
by
south
miles
from
this
point
of
freshwater
cove
the
latitude
we
obtained
in
the
course
of
the
night
gave
a
result
of
degrees
minutes
south
april
at
daylight
we
continued
pursuing
our
south
by
east
course
following
the
same
kind
of
low
straight
rocky
shore
as
that
of
yesterday
afternoon
we
passed
inside
a
reef
fronting
the
shore
from
a
mile
south
of
freshwater
cove
this
passage
was
about
half
a
mile
wide
and
from
to
fathoms
deep
having
the
in
our
favour
we
proceeded
rapidly
and
at
the
end
of
four
miles
found
the
trend
of
the
coast
suddenly
changed
to
for
two
miles
when
it
again
took
a
southerly
direction
forming
a
chain
of
high
rocky
islets
deferring
our
examination
of
the
main
lying
about
a
mile
in
the
rear
of
these
islets
we
kept
on
our
south
by
east
course
in
the
direction
of
some
very
high
land
now
seen
for
the
first
time
three
miles
further
brought
us
to
a
small
rocky
islet
where
we
landed
for
a
set
of
angles
our
hopes
were
considerably
raised
on
reaching
the
top
of
this
islet
by
finding
that
we
looked
in
vain
for
land
towards
the
head
of
collier
bay
the
high
land
to
the
southward
proved
to
be
the
south
point
of
a
large
bay
having
on
its
northern
side
similar
high
ranges
lizards
this
island
was
overrun
with
a
great
variety
of
lizards
in
consequence
of
which
we
named
it
lizard
island
during
our
stay
here
two
birds
rare
on
this
part
of
the
coast
were
shot
they
were
of
a
smaller
kind
than
any
i
had
before
seen
and
differed
from
them
in
plumage
being
without
the
white
collar
round
the
neck
leaving
lizard
island
we
continued
our
southerly
route
and
ere
long
saw
more
land
ahead
lying
like
a
blue
cloud
on
the
horizon
ten
miles
brought
us
abreast
of
the
high
land
we
had
first
seen
and
six
more
to
the
southern
point
of
a
bay
lying
on
its
side
where
the
duties
of
the
survey
again
obliged
us
to
land
we
considered
ourselves
now
entering
once
more
on
the
new
lands
of
australia
as
captain
king
could
scarcely
have
had
even
a
distant
glimpse
of
this
part
his
extreme
southern
position
being
abreast
of
freshwater
cove
from
whence
he
describes
the
view
of
the
coast
as
follows
the
land
to
the
southward
trended
deeply
in
and
appeared
to
me
much
broken
in
its
character
we
therefore
naturally
looked
on
everything
here
with
a
greater
degree
of
interest
and
with
the
view
of
affording
time
to
examine
the
country
and
determine
the
position
of
this
point
by
observation
i
arranged
to
pass
the
night
in
its
vicinity
haematopus
picatus
described
in
the
appendix
to
captain
king
work
on
australia
head
of
collier
bay
the
view
from
this
station
blighted
our
hopes
of
finding
an
opening
leading
into
the
interior
from
collier
bay
for
we
could
trace
the
land
all
round
the
head
of
it
forming
high
ranges
without
a
single
break
this
malapropos
discovery
materially
diminished
the
pleasure
we
had
before
experienced
on
first
seeing
a
new
part
of
the
continent
about
twenty
miles
west
from
where
we
stood
were
a
group
of
islands
which
i
was
able
to
identify
as
those
seen
from
bathurst
island
near
the
eastern
entrance
point
of
king
sound
they
appeared
to
extend
about
ten
miles
in
a
northerly
direction
from
the
western
point
of
collier
bay
an
eagle
shot
whilst
using
the
theodolite
we
came
within
the
searching
glance
of
a
hungry
eagle
which
soaring
over
our
heads
for
some
time
at
length
swooped
within
range
of
our
guns
when
he
paid
for
his
curiosity
with
the
loss
of
his
life
this
was
the
only
rapacious
bird
we
saw
in
collier
bay
and
appears
to
be
of
the
species
falco
leucogaster
latham
on
examination
the
stomach
contained
fish
and
part
of
a
small
snake
and
from
what
i
have
since
observed
this
bird
frequents
the
sea
coast
their
nests
are
very
large
built
on
bare
spots
in
the
shape
of
a
pyramid
some
of
them
measuring
three
feet
in
diameter
and
six
high
to
convey
a
better
idea
of
the
size
and
exposed
situation
of
the
nests
of
these
birds
i
may
state
that
on
low
parts
of
the
coast
they
were
often
used
as
surveying
marks
this
projection
which
we
called
eagle
point
is
of
a
siliceous
sandstone
formation
intersected
by
nearly
vertical
veins
of
quartz
and
forms
a
spur
thrown
off
from
a
high
range
four
miles
to
the
we
did
not
find
any
water
in
the
few
miles
of
country
traversed
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
yet
everything
wore
a
rich
green
appearance
and
the
scenery
in
some
of
the
dells
we
crossed
was
very
picturesque
and
quite
alive
with
birds
and
insects
flights
of
parakeets
swept
by
with
a
rapidity
that
resembled
the
rushing
sound
of
a
passing
gust
of
wind
among
the
trees
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
banksia
common
in
western
australia
cunningham
the
botanist
who
accompanied

did
not
consider
its
indigenous
empire

to
the
coast
of
the
other
kinds
and
which
complete
all
the
variety
we
observed
on
this
part
of
the
continent
were
the
mimosa
acacia
papyrus
and
two
sorts
of
eucalyptus
there
were
also
several
plants

in

the

we
had
a
breeze
throughout
the
entire
day
from
till
then
till
near
midnight
this
westerly
or
seabreeze
reached
us
within
ten
minutes
of
the
time
it
did
yesterday
a
regularity
we
found
to
prevail
the
few
days
we
spent
on
this
part
of
the
coast
the
tide
being
near
the
spring
fell
in
the
night

leaving
the
greater
part
of
the
bay
dry
at
our
observations
for
latitude
placed
eagle
point
in
degrees
minutes
south
april
we
left
with
the
first
streak
of
dawn
and
pursued
our
course
to
the
southward
passing
inside
a
small
reef
lying
half
a
mile
west
from
eagle
point
the
eastern
shore
now
took
a
south
by
west
direction
forming
shallow
bights
flanked
by
hills
of
moderate
elevation
our
next
station
was
an
islet
at
the
head
of
collier
bay
bearing
west
miles
from
eagle
point
it
was
in
the
mouth
of
a
shoal
bay
about
three
miles
deep
in
a
direction
the
shores
of
which
were
lined
with
mangroves
and
overlooked
by
a
high
rocky
ridge
the
width
of
collier
bay
at
its
entrance
miles
was
here
only
six
narrow
inlet
the
western
shore
ran
in
a
by
west
direction
a
straight
rocky
coast
over
which
rose
abruptly
a
range
of
barren
heights
the
tide
stream
gradually
weakened
as
we
approached
the
head
of
the
bay
where
it
scarcely
exceeded
half
a
knot
and
the
soundings
decreased
to
seven
fathoms
with
a
kind
of
muddy
sand
bottom
but
the
clearness
of
the
water
and
the
equal
duration
of
the
flood
and
ebb
streams
afforded
the
most
conclusive
evidence
of
the
small
opening
we
now
discovered
in
the
corner
of
the
bay
being
nothing
more
than
an
inlet
it
bore
from
this
islet
four
miles
yet
as
a
drowning
man
catches
at
a
straw
so
did
we
at
this
inlet
and
were
soon
in
the
entrance
which
we
found
to
be
half
a
mile
wide
with
a
very
strong
tide
rushing
out
after
some
difficulty
we
landed
on
a
high
rocky
island
in
the
mouth
of
it
the
summit
of
which
afforded
us
a
good
view
of
the
inlet
which
within
the
entrance
widened
out
and
was
about
two
miles
deep
a
point
prevented
our
seeing
the
eastern
extreme
which
helpman
was
sent
to
examine
he
found
it
extended
two
miles
in
an
direction
and
like
the
other
parts
of
it
to
be
lined
with
a
scanty
growth
of
mangroves
and
flanked
by
high
rocky
land
the
shape
of
this
inlet
resembles
that
of
a
bottle
with
a
broad
base
and
being
subject
to
a
tidal
change
of
level
of
feet
it
is
easy
to
imagine
with
what
violence
such
a
body
of
water
must
rush
through
the
narrow
entrance
to
keep
on
a
level
with
the
waters
of
the
bay
outside
the
cause
of
this
great
rise
of
tide
in
the
head
of
collier
bay
may
be
attributed
to
there
being
no
escape
for
the
vast
body
of
water
flowing
into
it
the
land
over
the
depth
of
this
inlet
which
i
have
before
spoken
of
as
being
barren

our
view
to
the
southward
it
bore
three
miles
and
lies
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
and
longitude
degrees
minutes
east

the
farthest
point

determined
towards
the

reached
in

bears
from

fifty
miles
thus
terminated
our
explorations
in
collier
bay
and
although
we
had
not
the
good
fortune
to
find
it
the
outlet
of
some
large
opening
leading
into
the
interior
still
we
succeeded
in
setting
at
rest
the
speculation
such
a
deep
indentation
of
the
coastline
had
hitherto
afforded
and
increased
our
geographical
knowledge
of
this
part
of
the
continent

in
the
afternoon
we
commenced
our
return
to
port
george
the
fourth
from
which
we
were
then
distant
about
miles
after
delaying
to
examine
two
islands
lying
north
by
east
four
miles
from
the
inlet
of
slate
formation
we
reached
a
narrow
point
six
miles
further
down
the
bay
in
time
to
save
a
true
bearing
from
the
sun
amplitude
we
were
surprised
to
find
this
point
also
composed
of
the
same
kind
of
grey
slate
the
islands
we
examined
differed
from
those
of

steep
precipitous
sides

the
instead
of
to
the
as
it
was
by
this

we
did
not
proceed
farther

was

point
the
large
bay
discovered
on
our
way
to
the
southward
now
became
the
point
of
interest
and
as
daylight
closed
in
the
boats
were
secured
in
a
small
sandy
cove
just
within
its
southern
point
where
there
were
several
native
rafts
constructed
precisely
in
the
same
manner
as
those
seen
in
king
sound
from
which
circumstance
we
called
the
place
raft
point
immediately
over
it
was
the
high
land
first
seen
in
coming
down
the
bay
huge
masses
were
rent
from
its
lofty
frowning
crags
on
which
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
produced
the
most
grotesque
figures
a
beautiful
stream
of
water
fell
into
the
sea
in
leaping
cascades
half
a
mile
inside
the
cove
several
rock
kangaroos
were
seen
on
the
heights
and
after
securing
observations
with
some
early
stars
for
latitude
which
placed
raft
point
in
degrees
minutes
south
we
tried
an
experiment
to
get
a
shot
at
the
kangaroos
by
setting
fire
to
the
grass
and

wood
growing
at
the

soon
kindled

in

resounded
with
the
noise
of
the
flames
as
they
darted
fiercely
upwards
revealing
their
riven
sides
and
occasionally
bursting
out
behind
large
masses
of
strange
figured
rocks

the
no
slight
risk
of
our
sportsmen
who
were
perched
upon
them

from
their
resting
places
screamed
fearfully
and
the
dismal
howl
of
the
wild
dog
equally
alarmed
sometimes
fell
on
the
ear
amidst
the
roaring
of
the
dangerous
element
which
in
the
intense
darkness
of
the
night
we
could
not
but
admire
whilst
gazing
on
this
wild
scene
i
could
not
help
speculating
on
the
probable
cause
the
natives
would
assign
for
this
great
conflagration
the
bright
glare
of
which
must
have
extended
over
several
miles
of
country
perhaps
alarming
and
doubtless
causing
deep
consultation
amongst
the
wise
men
of
their
tribes
it
may
also
have
taxed
their
power
of
invention
as
they
never
use
large
fires
in
the
night
except
in
wild
stormy
weather
when
the
creaking
trees
and
moaning
wind
give
them
a
dread
of
a
visit
from
the
evil
spirit
april
being
anxious
to
examine
the
range
over
the
cove
i
desired
helpman
to
explore
the
corner
of
this
large
bay
and
the
main
lying
behind
the
islands
fronting
the
coast
to
the
northward
of
it
we
accordingly
moved
off
on
our
several
occupations
at
an
early
hour
after
much
difficulty
fitzmaurice
and
myself
found
ourselves
on
a
tableland
of
sandstone
formation
elevated
by
measurement
feet
above
the
sea
level
and
by
far
the
highest
land
yet
noticed
on
this
part
of
the
continent
the
prospect
here
was
very
cheerless
similar
but
lower
ranges
met
the
eye
in
every
direction
towards
the
interior
those
overlooking
the
eastern
shore
of
the
bay
were
from
to
feet
high
there
appeared
to
be
a
large
island
in
its
corner
which
fell
back
about
miles
and
like
many
other
parts
of
it
was
lined
with
a
growth
of
mangroves
a
string
of
smaller
islands
extended
three
miles
from
the
north
point
leaving
an
entrance
only
two
miles
wide
a
sandstone
ridge
similar
to
that
on
which
we
stood
rose
abruptly
from
the
north
point
but
of
less
elevation
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
that
lieutenant
grey
had
seen
land
from
to
feet
high
only
about
miles
from
the
height
on
which
we
stood
but
as
he
had
not
the
means
of
measuring
these
great
elevations
and
as
captain
king
who
was
within
miles
of
the
high
land
alluded
to
does
not
notice
it
yet
mentions
some
hills
from
to
feet
high
miles
further
to
the
i
am
induced
to
believe
that
lieutenant
grey
may
have
the
height
of
the
land
he
saw
mounts
trafalgar
and
waterloo
which
are
not
nine
hundred
feet
high
are
the
first
points
of
the
continent
that
meet
the
eye
from
seaward
doubtful
bay
from
subsequent
information
i
called
this
doubtful
bay
the
tide
ran
into
it
at
the
rate
of
from
to
knots
but
the
clear
appearance
of
the
water
and
entire
absence
of
driftwood
afforded
strong
grounds
for
supposing
that
it
did
not
receive
the
waters
of
any
river
leaving
raft
point
we
crossed
over
to
the
islands
on
the
opposite
side
for
a
few
angles
on
their
southern
extreme
and
afterwards
made
the
best
of
our
way
to
freshwater
cove
the
day
had
however
closed
in
long
before
arriving
there
and
in
the
extreme
darkness
of
the
night
the
cove
was
difficult
to
find
indeed
my
companions
could
not
believe
we
were
there
until
one
of
the
men
returned
with
a
keg
of
water
from
the
stream
in
the
head
of
it
helpman
report
helpman
joined
us
at
sunset
and
gave
the
following
report
of
his
proceedings
on
leaving
the
cove
at
raft
point
we
passed
along
the
south
shore
for
two
miles
and
landed
on
a
point
that
afforded
a
most
commanding
view
of
the
bay
and
the
openings
in
its
corner
which
appeared
to
be
formed
by
a
large
island
lying
near
the
shore
this
supposition
afterwards
proved
to
be
correct
on
landing
at
a
point
fronting
its
western
extreme
from
whence
i
was
enabled
to
trace
the
shore
round
the
corner
of
the
bay
till
i
identified
it
as
the
same
we
had
seen
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
island
from
the
station
just
left
from
the
still
and
discoloured
state
of
the
water
i
felt
satisfied
there
was
no
opening
in
the
corner
of
this
bay
i
am
however
willing
to
admit
it
may
have
been
more
satisfactory
to
others
if
there
had
been
sufficient
time
at
my
disposal
to
have
actually
gone
round
the
island
we
now
hastened
off
to
examine
the
mainland
lying
behind
a
chain
of
islands
to
the
northward
where
we
also
failed
to
discover
an
opening
mouth
of
the
glenelg
as
this
account
of
helpman
coincided
with
the
opinion
i
had
formed
of
the
other
parts
of
the
coast
i
was
induced
at
that
time
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
river
glenelg
which
i
found
lieutenants
grey
and
lushington
had
discovered
on
my
return
to
the
ship
did
not
communicate
with
the
sea
in
this
neighbourhood
as
lieutenant
grey
had
supposed
but
took
a
direction
flanking
collier
bay
and
terminating
in
the
mangrove
openings
on
the
eastern
shore
of
stokes
bay
in
king
sound
my
opinion
was
strengthened
by
lieutenant
lushington
having
seen
from
his
furthest
position
which
has
already
been
given
a
very
high
bluff
point
to
the
southward
distant
or
miles
and
a
line
of
cliffs
under
which
he
conceived
that
an
opening
of
the
sea
or
a
river
may
run
further
experience
has
convinced
me
of
the
great
difficulty
attending
the
discovery
of
the
mouths
of
rivers
in
australia
and
as
helpman
did
not
actually
visit
the
corner
of
doubtful
bay
named
in
consequence
i
am
inclined
to
believe
there
is
a
possibility
of
the
mouth
of
the
glenelg
still
being
found
there
april
we
were
on
our
way
to
point
hall
before
the
eastern
hills
had
received
their
golden
hue
from
the
rays
of
the
rising
sun
and
landed
to
ascend
the
summit
of
that
headland
from
the
bay
on
its
side
which
proved
to
be
a
safe
anchorage
except
with
winds
having
a
small
islet
in
its
centre
we
ascended
the
height
on
the
lee
side
and
as
the
sun
was
now
approaching
the
zenith
the
heat
became
very
oppressive
but
the
air
was
quite
perfumed
with
the
rich
fragrance
of
different
gums
this
warm
aromatic
odour
we
always
experienced
in
a
slighter
degree
on
first
landing
in
australia
remarkable
tree
i
noticed
a
tree
quite
new
to
me
it
was
of
stunted
growth
bearing
a
fruit
resembling
a
small
russet
apple
which
hung
in
clusters
at
the
extremity
of
small
branches
the
skin
was
rough
covering
a
pulp
that
had
an
acid
flavour
inside
of
which
was
a
large
stone
and
i
observed
a
white
fluid
exuded
from
the
branches
when
broken
although
this
was
almost
a
solitary
tree
i
have
since
learnt
it
grows
in
the
southern
parts
of
the
continent
as
the
woodcut
and
description
given
in
page
volume
of
sir
thomas
mitchell
work
on
australia
is
almost
identical
with
this
fruit
it
must
be
indigenous
to
a
great
extent
of
country
since
sir
thomas
mitchell
found
it
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
whilst
by
us
it
was
discovered
in
degrees
minutes
south
we
did
not
observe
any
other
change
in
the
vegetation
on
this
point
of
birds
we
saw
but
few
chiefly
parrots
some
of
which
we
shot
a
coast
range
of
brown
grassy
hills
prevented
our
seeing
anything
of
the
interior
to
seaward
there
was
neither
islet
nor
reef
to
interrupt
the
blue
surface
of
water
that
bounded
our
view
in
the
far
descending
we
embarked
from
a
cove
on
the
side
where
the
boats
had
been
ordered
to
meet
us
between
this
and
one
on
the
opposite
side
there
was
only
a
narrow
neck
of
low
land
it
is
singular
that
we
should
not
have
seen
any
natives
or
even
traces
of
them
anywhere
excepting
at
raft
point
during
the
whole
of
this
cruise
the
slate
isles
pursuing
our
northerly
course
we
reached
a
small
group
of
islands
named
from
their
formation
slate
isles
finding
that
all
the
material
required
here
for
the
chart
could
not
be
collected
this
evening
i
desired
helpman
to
go
on
to
brecknock
harbour
to
sound
and
examine
its
southern
shore
the
next
morning
whilst
fitzmaurice
and
myself
remained
to
complete
the
survey
hereabouts
april
we
were
on
the
top
of
the
northern
slate
island
early
a
small
islet
with
a
reef
off
its
northern
extreme
bore
north
a
mile
and
a
half
and
a
low
sandy
isle
west
north
about
miles
this
was
a
most
unwelcome
discovery
as
it
lay
in
the
track
of
vessels
approaching
brecknock
harbour
and
which
captain
king
must
have
passed
very
close
to
in
the
night
without
being
aware
of
it
we
were
fortunate
in
being
able
to
intersect
our
lines
to
the
extremes
of
all
the
islands
forming
the
north
side
of
camden
sound
from
this
station
which
rendered
it
one
of
great
importance
of
the
interior
we
saw
even
less
than
from
point
hall
and
the
prospect
if
possible
was
more
cheerless
our
again
meeting
rocks
of
transition
origin
led
us
to
infer
that
the
soil
in
the
neighbourhood
was
of
a
better
quality
as
the
decomposition
of
rocks
of
this
class
furnishes
a
much
more
fertile
soil
than
sandstone
of
recent
formation
leaving
the
slate
islands
we
reached
entrance
isle
in
brecknock
harbour
in
time
to
secure
observations
for
the
rates
of
the
chronometers
which
we
found
had
been
performing
admirably
they
placed
the
sandy

side
of

at
this
place
helpman
rejoined
us
having
completed
the
examination
of
the
south
shore
of
the
harbour
from
a
high
hill
over
it
he
discovered
some
fine
country
bearing
about
eight
miles
in
speaking
of
it
he
says
i
was
invited
to
the
top
of
this
hill
by
the
certainty
of
a
good
view
of
the
interior
over
the
low
land
forming
the
shore
of
the
harbour
and
most
amply
was
i
repaid
for
the
toil
of
ascending
it
by
feasting
my
eyes
on
a
most
luxuriant
country
lying
at
the
eastern
foot
of
a
remarkable
peak
visible
from
port

to

miles
of
the
part
of

the
proximity
of
such
fertile
land
to
this
fine
port
was
of
great
importance
and
induced
us
to
consider
it
a
great
addition
to
our
discoveries
in
australia
under
this
impression
i
trust
the
following
brief
description
of
it

not
be
without
its
value

the
eyes
of
some
of
my

lieutenant
grey
april
although
very
anxious
to
learn
if
they
had
in
the
ship
heard
anything
of
lieutenant
grey
party
still
i
did
not
like
to
break
through
my
usual
rule
of
indulging
in
a
thorough
cleansing
of
men
and
boats
before
making
our
appearance
on
board
we
therefore
did
not
make
an
early
start
in
clearing
roger
strait
we
heard
the
cry
of
a
native
who
was
seen
with
the
aid
of
a
perched
on
a
distant
cliff
watching
our
movements
i
scarcely
believed
it
possible
to
have
heard
his
shrill
voice
so
far
we
reached
the
ship
lying
in
port
george
the
fourth
early
in
the
afternoon
and
found
on
board
a
most
welcome
addition
to
our
little
party
in
the
person
of
lieutenant
grey
i
met
him
again
with
feelings
of
the
greatest
satisfaction
for
though
none
were
perhaps
fully
aware
of
it
a
feeling
of
despondency
as
to
the
fate
of
himself
and
his
companions
had
more
than
once
occurred
to
me
which
each
day
delay
much
increased
and
which
this
agreeable
rencounter
at
once
effectually
removed
poor
fellow
gaunt
misery
had
worn
him
to
the
bone
and
i
believe
that
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
not
myself
alone
but
lieutenant
grey
most
intimate
friends
would
have
stared
at
him
without
the
least
approach
to
recognition
badly
wounded
and
half
starved
he
did
indeed
present
a
melancholy
contrast
to
the
vigorous
and
determined
enthusiast
we
had
parted
from
a
few
months
before
at
the
cape
to
whom
danger
seemed
to
have
a
charm
distinct
from
success
no
sooner
had
we
ascertained
the
safety
of
the
rest
of
the
party
than
as
might
be
supposed
we
fell
into
a
long
and
animated
conversation
upon
the
success
of
the
expedition
they
had
discovered
a
river
called
by
them
the
glenelg
and
a
tract
of
fine
country
which
from
lieutenant
grey
description
i
instantly
recognised
as
being
the
same
helpman
had
seen
from
brecknock
harbour
a
spot
sixty
miles
in
a
direction
from
hanover
bay
indicates
their
furthest
distance
towards
the
interior
the
rugged
nature
of
the
country
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
coast
and
its
vast
distance
from
the
interior
from
whence
it
is
further
removed
than
any
other
part
of
the
continent
justify
the
expression
of
an
opinion
that
this
was
an
spot
for
the
debarkation
of
an
expedition
for
inland
research
though
unquestionably
its
proximity
to
our
east
indian
possessions
would
make
it
if
suitable
in
other
respects
a
most
valuable
spot
for
colonization
i
shall
always
regret
that
lieutenant
grey
and
his
companions
had
not
the
advantage
of
starting
from
the
fitzroy
or
exploring
yet
further
the
unknown
course
of
the
victoria
by
which
i
am
now
convinced
a
most
successful
attempt
to
reach
the
interior
might
be
made
alas
while
we
can
not
but
regret
the
prodigal
sacrifices
of
health
and
energy
made
to
acquire
such
a
limited
knowledge
of
a
part
of
the
continent
hitherto
utterly
unknown
we
must
not
forget
to
do
justice
to
the
perseverance
which
opposing
obstacles
could
defeat
but
not
daunt
and
in
what
it
did
accomplish
furnished
additional
motives
to
renewed
exertion
and
useful
suggestions
by
which
more
fortunate
followers
may
reap
the
success
deserved
by
though
denied
to
the
first
adventurers
the
worn
and
haggard
aspect
of
lieutenant
grey
and
all
his
companions
spoke
of
itself
how
severe
had
been
the
hardships
they
were
called
on
to
endure
i
need
not
say
that
their
wants
were
relieved
with
the
utmost
eagerness
of
frank
hospitality
and
that
their
tales
of
escapes
and
moving
accidents
awoke
all
ears
and
stirred
in
every
heart
to
meet
with
a
countryman
in
a
foreign
land
is
of
itself
generally
an
agreeable
incident
the
tones
of
one
native
language
or
the
reminiscences
of
one
earlier
and
happier
years
which
such
a
meeting
recalls
are
sure
to
bestow
upon
it
a
pleasure
of
its
own
what
was
it
then
to
meet
a
former
fellow
voyager
and
a
friend
to
meet
him
after
almost
despairing
of
his
safety
and
to
meet
him
fresh
from
a
perilous
and
partially
successful
attempt
to
penetrate
into
the
same
unknown
and
mysterious
country
a
further
and
more
perfect
acquaintance
with
which
was
a
prime
object
of
my
own
personal
ambition
no
less
than
of
public
duty
with
all
engaged
in
our
present
adventure
those
who
have
known
the
communion
of
sentiment
and
interest
which
it
is
the
tendency
of
one
common
purpose
to
create
among
all
by
whom
that
purpose
is
shared
can
most
readily
and
most
perfectly
understand
with
what
deep
and
mutual
interest
lieutenant
grey
and
myself
heard
and
recounted
all
that
each
had
done
since
our
parting
at
the
cape
several
anecdotes
of
his
adventures
confirmed
my
own
experience
and
add
weight
to
the
opinions
i
have
before
expressed
from
his
description
of
the
tribes
his
party
had
encountered
he
must
have
been
among
a
people
more
advanced
in
civilization
than
any
we
had
hitherto
seen
upon
this
coast
he
found
several
curious
figures
images
and
drawings
generally
in
colours
upon
the
sides
of
caves
in
the
sandstone
rock
which
notwithstanding
their
rude
style
yet
evince
a
greater
degree
of
advancement
and
intelligence
than
we
have
been
able
to
find
any
traces
of
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
remembered
that
no
certain
date
absolutely
connects
these
works
with
the
present
generation
the
dryness
of
the
natural
walls
upon
which
they
are
executed
and
the
absence
of
any
atmospheric
moisture
may
have
and
may
yet
preserve
them
for
an
indefinite
period
and
their
history
read
aright
may
testify
not
the
present
condition
of
the
australian
school
of
design
but
the
perfection
which
it
had
formerly
attained
illustrated
in
lieutenant
grey
first
volume
natives
lieutenant
grey
too
like
ourselves
had
seen
certain
individuals
in
company
with
the
natives
much
lighter
in
colour
and
widely
differing
in
figure
and
physiognomy
from
the
savages
by
whom
they
were
surrounded
and
was
inclined
to
believe
that
they
are
descended
from
dutch
sailors
who
at
different
times
suffering
shipwreck
upon
the
coast
have
intermarried
with
its
native
inhabitants
but
as
no
authentic
records
can
be
produced
to
prove
that
this
portion
of
the
coast
was
ever
visited
by
dutch
navigators
at
all
i
am
still
more
disposed
to
believe
that
these
lighter
coloured
people
are
malays
captured
from
the
trepang
fishers
or
perhaps
voluntarily
associating
with
the
australian
as
we
know
that
the
australian
not
unfrequently
abandons
his
country
and
his
mode
of
life
to
visit
the
indian
archipelago
with
them
before
pursuing
any
further
the
train
of
speculation
in
which
my
thoughts
naturally
enough
arranged
themselves
owing
to
this
meeting
with
lieutenant
grey
it
may
be
as
well
to
advert
to
the
circumstances
under
which
he
and
his
party
were
found
by
captain
wickham
it
seems
that
on
moving
into
port
george
the
fourth
the
ship
guns
were
fired
in
order
to
apprize
the
wanderers
if
within
hearing
that
friends
and
aid
were
at
hand
these
signals
were
heard
on
board
the
lynher
and
were
at
once
rightly
understood
to
denote
the
presence
of
the
beagle
at
that
time
however
the
master
of
the
lynher
the
schooner
which
lieutenant
grey
had
chartered
at
the
cape
was
himself
in
no
small
perplexity
as
to
the
fate
of
those
he
had
transported
to
this
lonely
coast
and
was
now
growing
exceedingly
anxious
at
their
the
next
morning
the
captain
wickham
started
in
the
yawl
for
hanover
bay
in
order
to
prosecute
the
search
at
the
point
where
he
knew
lieutenant
grey
depot
was
to
be
established
and
on
rounding
the
headland
the
first
welcome
object
that
met
his
eye
was
the
schooner
at
anchor
captain
wickham
learnt
from
browse
the
master
that
the
period
for
which
the
schooner
was
chartered
having
expired
he
was
only
waiting
the
return
of
the
expedition
from
motives
of
humanity
the
further
care
of
lieutenant
grey
and
his
comrades
was
at
once
undertaken
by
captain
wickham
by
whom
it
was
determined
owing
to
the
shortness
of
provisions
on
board
the
beagle
to
proceed
to
timor
on
the
return
of
the
boats
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
revictual
there
leaving
some
conspicuous
record
of
his
recent
visit
with
hidden
letters
declaratory
of
his
proceedings
and
promising
his
speedy
return
a
party
was
immediately
despatched
on
shore
and
upon
the
face
of
the
sandstone
cliff
they
painted
in
characters
of
gigantic
proportion
beagle
observatory
letters
paces
of
necessity
compelled
to
wait
for
the
boats
captain
wickham
returned
to
the
beagle
captain
wickham
meeting
with
lieutenant
grey
on
the
morning
of
the
lieutenant
grey
accompanied
by
two
of
his
party
made
his
appearance
upon
the
shores
of
hanover
bay
after
a
twelve
weeks
wander
in
the
interior
during
which
great
hardships
fatigue
and
peril
had
been
undergone
and
much
curious
and
valuable
information
collected
hearing
of
the
proximity
of
the
beagle
he
lost
not
a
moment
but
hastened
to
assure
captain
wickham
that
the
whole
party
was
safe
and
spent
the
evening
of
the
that
previous
to
my
return
among
those
who
sympathized
with
his
sufferings
and
heartily
welcomed
him
once
more
on
board
after
the
first
greetings
had
been
exchanged
between
us
lieutenant
grey
professed
the
utmost
anxiety
to
hear
whether
during
our
late
excursion
in
the
boats
we
had
discovered
the
mouth
of
the
glenelg
the
river
first
seen
by
him
on
the
of
march
i
was
of
course
compelled
to
inform
him
that
we
had
found
no
trace
of
any
river
although
the
coast
from
port
george
the
fourth
to
the
bottom
of
collier
bay
an
extent
of
nearly
one
hundred
miles
had
been
examined
and
with
the
exception
i
have
already
noticed
too
closely
to
admit
of
mistake
an
evening
with
lieutenant
grey
the
next
afternoon
i
followed
lieutenant
grey
round
to
hanover
bay
distant
twelve
miles
from
the
beagle
anchorage
on
the
passage
i
noticed
that
the
remarkable
bluff
spoken
of
by
captain
king
had
been
omitted
in
the
charts
and
a
low
rocky
point
marked
in
its
place
it
was
after
sunset
when
we
reached
the
schooner
in
hanover
bay
the
greater
part
of
the
night
was
devoted
to
an
examination
of
lieutenant
plans
of
his
expedition
and
the
drawings
with
which
various
events
in
it
had
been
illustrated
all
these
were
executed
with
a
finished
carefulness
one
could
not
have
expected
to
find
in
works
carried
on
in
the
bush
and
under
such
varied
circumstances
of
distraction
and
anxiety
as
had
followed
lieutenant
grey
footsteps
though
terribly
worn
and
ill
our
opportune
arrival
and
the
feeling
that
he
was
among
those
who
could
appreciate
his
exertions
seemed
already
to
operate
in
his
recovery
upon
an
old
and
tattered
chart
that
had
indeed
done
the
state
some
service
we
attempted
to
settle
the
probable
course
of
the
glenelg
the
knotty
question
held
us
for
some
hours
in
hot
debate
but
as
in
a
previous
paragraph
i
have
rendered
my
more
deliberate
opinions
i
need
not
here
recount
the
varied
topics
discussed
during
that
memorable
evening
but
it
may
be
readily
imagined
with
how
swift
a
flight
one
hour
followed
another
while
i
listened
with
eager
impatience
to
lieutenant
account
of
a
country
and
people
till
now
unknown
even
to
english
enterprise
he
appears
to
have
seen
the
same
kind
of
that
we
observed
in
king
sound
grey
australia
volume
page
the
encampment
i
took
the
boat
in
the
afternoon
at
to
proceed
to
the
encampment
which
we
were
then
able
to
approach
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
it
was
situated
in
the
depth
of
a
creek
into
which
a
clear
and
sparkling
stream
of
fresh
water
poured
its
abundance
the
shore
was
formed
of
enormous
granite
boulders
which
rendered
it
hardly
accessible
except
at
and
the
red
sandstone
platform
which
is
here
the
nature
of
the
coast
was
abruptly
intersected
by
one
of
those
singular
valleys
which
give
so
marked
and
so
distinctive
a
characteristic
to
australian
geology
the
separated
cliffs
approach
to
within
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
each
other
and
then
still
preserving
their
precipitous
form
recede
some
three
miles
inland
in
a
southerly
direction
and
there
rejoining
make
any
passage
from
walker
to
the
interior
a
barely
practicable
feat
so
named
by
lieutenant
grey
to
commemorate
the
services
rendered
by
the
surgeon
of
his
party
in
finding
a
road
from
it
to
the
interjacent
country
timor
ponies
the
encampment
consisted
of
a
few
roofless
huts
placed
irregularly
upon
a
carpet
of
rich
grass
whereon
six
timor
ponies
were
recruiting
after
the
fatigues
of
a
journey
in
which
they
appeared
to
have
borne
their
full
share
of
privation
and
danger
their
marketable
value
was
indeed
but
small
and
lieutenant
grey
had
therefore
determined
to
leave
them
behind
in
the
unrestrained
enjoyment
of
their
natural
freedom
my
visit
was
made
after
the
encampment
had
been
finally
abandoned
and
the
thought
that
a
little
spot
once
tenanted
by
civilized
man
was
about
to
be
yielded
to
that
dreary
solitude
from
which
for
a
while
he
had
rescued
it
made
the
pilgrimage
a
melancholy
one
the
scene
itself
was
in
strict
keeping
with
such
thoughts
the
rugged
and
lofty
cliffs
which
frown
down
upon
the
valley
the
flitting
shadows
of
the
watchful
eagles
soaring
far
over
my
head
and
the
hoarse
murmurs
of
the
tide
among
the
rocky
masses
on
the
beach
ail
heightened
the
effects
of
a
picture
engraven
on
my
memory
too
deeply
for
time
itself
to
efface
while
the
men
were
preparing
for
embarkation
i
strolled
with
lieutenant
lushington
up
the
valley
a
little
beyond
the
late
encampment
the
timor
ponies
were
busily
engaged
upon
the
fresh
grass
near
the
banks
of
a
beautiful
pool
in
which
we
both
enjoyed
a
freshwater
bath
i
noticed
a
small
coconut
tree
and
some
other
plants
which
he
and
his
companions
had
benevolently
endeavoured
to
naturalize
here
they
seemed
healthy
enough
but
i
should
fear
the
rank
luxuriance
of
surrounding
and
indigenous
vegetation
will
render
the
ultimate
of
the
strangers
exceedingly
doubtful
assisted
by
our
boats
the
whole
party
embarked
in
the
early
part
of
the
afternoon
and
appeared
highly
delighted
to
find
themselves
again
on
board
the
schooner
i
was
much
impressed
with
the
emphatic
manner
in
which
lieutenant
lushington
bid
the
shore
a
hearty
farewell
the
same
evening
the
lynher
was
moved
round
to
port
george
the
fourth
thus
affording
us
an
opportunity
of
welcoming
all
our
former
once
more
on
board
the
beagle
where
we
spent
one
of
those
delightful
evenings
known
only
to
those
who
have
been
long
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
leave
port
george
the
fourth
on
the
we
left
port
george
the
fourth
on
our
return
to
swan
river
in
company
with
the
lynher
in
which
lieutenant
grey
and
his
party
had
arranged
to
proceed
to
the
mauritius
a
finer
port
than
this
in
some
respects
can
hardly
be
imagined
like
hanover
bay
over
which
however
it
possesses
the
advantage
of
an
easier
access
from
the
sea
it
affords
safe
anchorage
abundance
of
fresh
water
plenty
of
fuel
and
a
fine
beach
for
the
seine
but
the
numerous
islands
and
reefs
which
skirt
this
coast
greatly
reduce
the
value
of
both
these
harbours
the
master
of
the
lynher
told
me
of
certain
tidal
phenomena
remarked
by
him
during
his
protracted
visit
to
hanover
bay
he
had
noticed
that
the
highest
tides
always
occurred
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
full
or
change
of
the
moon
and
that
they
then
attained
a
maximum
height
of
feet
while
during
the
neaps
the
difference
between
high
and
sometimes
did
not
exceed
inches
during
the
short
time
that
we
were
in
this
neighbourhood
the
prevailing
winds
were
from
and
to
east
from
after
midnight
till
noon
and
from
west
to
north
until
midnight
our
progress
through
the
day
was
but
slow
the
wind
light
and
most
provokingly
foul
at
isolated
rock
while
standing
towards
a
small
island
bearing
north
and
by
west
five
and
a
half
miles
from
point
adieu
we
discovered
a
single
rock
with
apparently
deep
water
all
around
it
and
just
awash
at
it
bore
and
by
west
of
a
mile
from
this
island
which
resembles
red
island
and
captain
king
group
of
the
rocky
islands
in
that
appearance
which
has
by
turns
given
them
red
and
brown
for
a
distinct
appellation
in
the
afternoon
we
saw
the
sandbank
laid
down
in
captain
king
chart
it
appeared
a
white
rocky
islet
the
night
was
spent
beating
to
the
westward
between
it
and
red
island
against
a
light
breeze
april
at
daylight
whilst
standing
to
the
the
water
shoaled
rapidly
though
regularly
from
to
fathoms
we
then
tacked
red
island
bearing
one
mile
and
a
quarter
in
standing
out
north
the
water
deepened
suddenly
and
almost
immediately
to
fathoms
i
imagine
this
shoal
to
be
a
continuation
of
one
laid
down
by
captain
king
extending
two
miles
south
from
red
island
passing
the
latter
on
our
way
to
port
george
the
fourth
we
had
to
fathoms
two
and
a
half
miles
from
its
side
april
we
continued
to
make
but
little
progress
to
the
westward
scarcely
averaging
more
than
a
mile
per
hour
the
soundings
indicating
that
we
were
still
on
the
coral
ledge
that
skirts
the
whole
of
this
coast
northward
of
cape
leveque
on
the
raised
parts
of
which
are
numerous
reefs
of
an
irregular
size
and
almost
invariably
trending
from
west
to
the
number
of
these
low
coral
reefs
already
known
and
the
probable
number
of
those
yet
undiscovered
make
this
rather
a
dangerous
sea
and
must
have
a
tendency
to
lessen
the
value
of
the
coast
of
australia
for
purposes
of
forming
settlements
in
the
afternoon
we
saw
again
the
reef
discovered
and
named
after
the
beagle
steering
we
passed
four
miles
from
its
northern
side
in
soundings
varying
from
to
fathoms
remarkable
ripplings
april
towards
the
close
of
this
day
we
passed
through
a
line
of
very
remarkable
ripplings
extending
in
a
north
and
south
direction
which
we
knew
indicated
some
great
inequality
in
the
bottom
but
whether
from
deep
to
shoal
water
was
a
matter
of
some
anxiety
therefore
with
leadsmen
in
the
chains
and
the
men
at
their
stations
for
working
ship
we
glided
into
this
streak
of
agitated
water
where
plunging
once
or
twice
she
again
passed
into
the
silent
deep
we
sounded
ineffectually
with
fathoms
in
the
ripplings
for
some
time
before
the
soundings
had
been
regular
and
fathoms
fine
sand
and
four
miles
beyond
it
we
had
fathoms
but
did
not
succeed
afterwards
in
reaching
the
bottom
with
fathoms
this
line
of
disturbed
water
therefore
marks
the
edge
of
the
bank
of
soundings
fronting
this
part
of
the
coast
from
which
the
nearest
point
cape
leveque
bore
miles
part
from
the
lynher
the
lynher
having
to
pursue
a
more
westerly
course
we
were
of
necessity
though
reluctantly
obliged
to
part
company
this
evening
the
few
evenings
we
passed
together
at
sea
were
rendered
very
pleasant
and
amusing
by
the
crews
singing
to
each
other
as
the
vessels
side
by
side
slipped
stealthily
through
the
moonlit
waters
april
still
pursuing
a
course
at
the
slow
rate
of
forty
miles
daily
our
position
at
noon
was
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
longitude
degrees
minutes
east
during
the
day
we
passed
within
fifteen
miles
of
the
lively
reef
and
from
the
numbers
of
terns
and
other
small
seabirds
seen
for
the
last
three
days
there
can
be
little
doubt
of
its
whereabouts
being
known
and
that
during
that
time
we
had
been
in
the
neighbourhood
of
other
reefs
still
undiscovered
april
we
experienced
the
long
rolling
swell
of
the
southern
ocean
which
as
well
as
our
reckoning
informed
us
we
were
rounding
cape
at
the
same
time
we
began
to
feel
a
steady
breeze
from
the
and
the
northerly
current
which
there
prevails
as
we
were
now
approaching
the
usual
track
of
vessels
bound
from
australia
to
india
we
were
not
unprepared
for
the
somewhat
unusual
sight
of
a
strange
sail
an
object
always
of
some
little
interest
but
which
becomes
quite
an
event
to
those
whose
duty
leads
them
into
the
less
frequented
portions
of
the
deep
the
tryal
rocks
the
increasing
trade
now
carried
on
between
sydney
and
the
gorgeous
east
has
converted
the
dividing
sea
into
a
beaten
track
and
as
no
further
evidence
has
been
brought
forward
to
confirm
the
reported
existence
of
the
tryal
rocks
asserted
to
lie
directly
in
the
course
steered
by
vessels
making
this
passage
i
can
not
but
adhere
to
captain
opinion
that
tremouille
island
and
its
outlying
reefs
situated
in
the
same
latitude
as
that
in
which
the
tryal
rocks
are
supposed
to
lie
have
originated
the
mistake
one
be
it
observed
of
longitude
in
which
particular
the
accounts
of
earlier
navigators
must
always
be
received
with
caution
subsequent
explorations
have
proved
this
to
be
the
case
anecdotes
of
miago
while
our
return
to
swan
river
was
thus
baffled
and
delayed
by
the
long
and
almost
unbroken
continuance
of
foul
winds
it
afforded
some
diversion
to
watch
the
countenance
and
conduct
of
miago
who
was
as
anxious
as
anyone
on
board
for
the
sight
of
his
native
land
he
would
stand
gazing
steadily
and
in
silence
over
the
sea
and
then
sometimes
perceiving
that
i
watched
him
say
to
me
miago
sing
by
and
by
northern
men
wind
jump
up
then
would
he
station
himself
for
hours
at
the
and
chant
to
some
imaginary
deity
an
incantation
or
prayer
to
change
the
opposing
wind
i
could
never
rightly
learn
to
whom
this
rude
melody
was
addressed
for
if
anyone
approached
him
near
enough
to
overhear
the
words
he
became
at
once
silent
but
there
was
a
mournful
and
pathetic
air
running
through
the
strain
that
rendered
it
by
no
means
unpleasing
though
doubtless
it
owed
much
of
its
effect
to
the
concomitant
circumstances
the
rude
savage
separated
from
all
his
former
companions
made
at
once
an
intimate
and
familiar
witness
of
some
of
the
wonders
of
civilization
carried
by
his
new
comrades
to
their
very
country
and
brought
face
to
face
with
his
traditionary
foes
the
dreaded
northern
men
and
now
returning
to
recount
to
his
yet
ruder
brethren
the
wonders
he
had
witnessed
could
not
fail
to
interest
the
least
imaginative
yet
miago
had
a
decided
and
most
inexplicable
advantage
over
all
on
board
and
that
in
a
matter
especially
relating
to
the
science
of
navigation
he
could
indicate
at
once
and
correctly
the
exact
direction
of
our
harbour
when
neither
sun
nor
stars
were
shining
to
assist
him
he
was
tried
frequently
and
under
very
varying
circumstances
but
strange
as
it
may
seem
he
was
invariably
right
this
faculty
though
somewhat
analogous
to
one
i
have
heard
ascribed
to
the
natives
of
north
america
had
very
much
surprised
me
when
exercised
on
shore
but
at
sea
out
of
the
sight
of
land
it
seemed
beyond
belief
as
assuredly
it
is
beyond
explanation
but
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
some
such
power
must
have
been
possessed
by
those
adventurous
seamen
who
long
before
the
discovery
of
the
compass
ventured
upon
distant
and
hazardous
voyages
i
used
sometimes
as
we
approached
the
land
of
his
nativity
to
question
him
upon
the
account
he
intended
to
give
his
friends
of
the
scenes
he
had
witnessed
and
i
was
quite
astonished
at
the
accuracy
with
which
he
remembered
the
various
places
we
had
visited
during
the
voyage
he
seemed
to
have
carried
the
ship
track
in
his
memory
with
the
most
careful
accuracy
his
description
of
the
ship
sailing
and
anchoring
were
most
amusing
he
used
to
say
ship
walk
walk
all
night
hard
walk
then
by
and
by
anchor
tumble
down
his
manner
of
describing
his
interviews
with
the
wicked
northern
men
was
most
graphic
his
countenance
and
figure
became
at
once
instinct
with
animation
and
energy
and
no
doubt
he
was
then
influenced
by
feelings
of
baffled
hatred
and
revenge
from
having
failed
in
his
determination
to
carry
off
in
triumph
one
of
their
gins
i
would
sometimes
amuse
myself
by
asking
him
how
he
was
to
excuse
himself
to
his
friends
for
having
failed
in
the
premised
exploit
but
the
subject
was
evidently
a
very
unpleasant
one
and
he
was
always
anxious
to
escape
from
it
in
spite
of
all
miago
evocations
for
a
change
of
wind
we
did
not
see

the
morning
of

the

on

after
passing

resembled
the

the

pointing

passed
along
the

of

by
keeping

under

we
first
steered
for
the

bearing
south
until
the
leading
marks
could
be
made
out
they
are
the
western
of
two
flat
rocks
lying
close
off
the

of

a
large

must
be
kept
its

lead
over

of

the
water
deepened
to

fathoms
the
course
was
then
changed
to
for
a
patch
of
low
cliffs
about
two
miles
south
of
fremantle
which
brought
us
up
to
owen

passing
between

and

banks
thus
concluded
our
first
cruise
on
this
almost
hitherto
unknown
part
of
the
continent
and
looking
at
its
results
we
had
every
reason
to
feel
satisfied
having
appended
miles
of
new
land
to
our
geographical
store
and
succeeded
in
an
object

paramount
interest

reception
by

we

amused
with
the
consequential
air
miago
assumed
towards
his
countrymen
on
our
arrival
which
afforded
us
a
not
uninstructive
instance
of
the
prevalence
of
the
ordinary
infirmities
of
our
common
human
nature
whether
of
pride
or
vanity
universally
to
be
met
with
both
in
the
civilised
man
and
the
uncultivated
savage
he
declared
that
he
would
not
land
until
they
first
came
off
to
wait
on
him
decorated
with
an
old
lieutenant
coat
white
trousers
and
a
cap
with
a
tall
feather
he
looked
upon
himself
as
a
most
exalted
personage
and
for
the
whole
of
the
first
day
remained
on
board
impatiently
but
in
vain
prying
into
each
boat
that
left
the
shore
for
the
dusky
forms
of
some
of
his
quondam
friends
his
pride
however
could
not
long
withstand
the
desire
of
display
yielding
to
the
impulse
of
vanity
he
early
the
following
morning
took
his
departure
from
the
ship
those
who
witnessed
the
meeting
described
it
as
cool
on
both
sides
arising
on
the
part
of
his
friends
from
jealousy
they
perhaps
judging
from
the
nature
of
his
costume
that
he
had
abandoned
his
bush
life
be
that
as
it
may
the
reception
tended
greatly
to
lower
the
pride
of
our
hero
who
through
generosity
expending
all
his
money
to
purchase
them
bread
or
from
a
fear
of
being
treacherously
speared
soon
convinced
his
former
associates
how
desirous
he
was
of
regaining
their
confidence
he
did
not
however
participate
in
the
revelry
then
going
on
amongst
the
natives
at
fremantle
where
at
this
period
of
the
year
they
assemble
in
great
numbers
to
feast
on
the
whales
that
are
brought
in
by
the
boats
of
a
whaling
establishment
which
i
can
not
allude
to
without
expressing
an
opinion
that
this
fishery
if
properly
managed
and
free
from
american
encroachments
would
become
one
of
the
most
important
branches
of
industry
during
the
time
that
miago
was
on
board
we
took
great
pains
to
wean
him
from
his
natural
propensity
for
the
savage
life
by
instilling
such
information
as
his
untutored
mind
was
capable
of
receiving
and
from
his
resolutions
we
were
led
to
hope
a
cure
had
been
effected
great
was
our
disappointment
then
on
finding
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
after
our
arrival
he
had
resumed
his
original
wildness
and
was
again
to
be
numbered
amongst
the
native
inhabitants
of
the
bush
to
us
he
had
been
the
source
of
great
mirth
by
the
absurd
anecdotes
he
sometimes
related
about
his
countrymen
his
account
of
their
conjectures
respecting
the
arrival
of
the
first
settlers
may
amuse
the
reader
he
said
the
ships
were
supposed
to
be
trees
and
the
cattle
large
dogs
the
only
animal
besides
the
kangaroo
known
to
them
whose
size
and
horns
excited
such
alarm
that
one
which
strayed
into
the
bush
being
met
by
a
party
of
natives
made
them
climb
up
the
nearest
trees
in
the
greatest
terror
state
of
the
colony
it
may
give
some
definite
idea
of
the
neglected
state
of
this
infant
colony
to
mention
that
during
the
entire
period
of
our
absence
a
space
of
six
months
there
had
been
but
one
arrival
there
and
that
not
from
england
the
solitary
visitor
was
pelorus
from
the
indian
station
the
want
of
communication
with
the
mother
country
was
beginning
to
be
felt
severely
and
in
matters
of
graver
moment
than
mere
news
many
necessary
articles
of
home
manufacture
or
importation
scarcely
valued
till
wanted
were
now
becoming
almost
unattainable
one
familiar
instance
will
illustrate
at
once
how
this
state
of
things
presses
upon
the
comfort
of
the
colonists
the
price
of
yellow
soap
had
risen
to
four
shillings
per
pound
owen
anchorage
the
usual
winter
anchorage
in
cockburn
sound
being
seven
miles
from
the
town
of
fremantle
the
colonists
were
naturally
very
anxious
to
see
tested
the
equal
security
of
one
which
we
had
chosen
within
half
that
distance
the
point
was
fairly
tried
and
very
satisfactorily
determined
during
the
heavy
weather
which
we
experienced
on
the
of
march
and
of
june
which
did
not
raise
more
sea
than
a
boat
at
anchor
could
have
ridden
out
with
safety
these
gales
lasted
about
hours
each
commencing
at
north
by
west
and
gradually
blowing
themselves
out
at
in
each
instance
a
heavy
bank
of
clouds
in
the
gave
us
a
day
notice
of
their
approach
the
indications
of
the
barometer
were
less
decisive
its
maximum
was
the
weather
in
the
interval
between
these
gales
was
wet
and
unsettled
but
afterwards
until
our
departure
it
continued
remarkably
fine
with
an
average
temperature
of
degrees
the
winds
at
this
season
prevail
from
the
land
the
seabreezes
being
both
light
and
very
irregular
anniversary
of
the
colony
we
were
just
in
time
to
share
in
the
annual
festivities
with
which
the
inhabitants
celebrate
the
formation
of
the
colony
horseracing
and
many
other
old
english
sports
showed
that
the
colonists
still
retain
the
tastes
and
habits
of
home
some
of
the
aborigines
took
part
in
the
amusements
of
the
day
with
evident
enjoyment
and
we
were
surprised
to
find
that
in
throwing
the
spear
they
were
excelled
by
an
english
competitor
we
hardly
know
how
to
reconcile
this
fact
with
our
own
favourite
theories
upon
the
perfection
of
the
savage
in
the
few
exercises
of
skill
to
which
he
devotes
his
attention
and
were
obliged
to
take
refuge
in
the
inadequate
suggestion
that
the
wild
man
requires
a
greater
degree
of
excitement
than
his
more
civilised
competitor
to
bring
out
or
call
into
action
all
the
resources
of
his
art
among
the
natives
assembled
were
a
small
party
from
king
george
sound
they
had
come
to
perth
bearing
despatches
from
that
place
the
good
understanding
which
appeared
to
exist
between
them
and
their
in
this
district
led
me
to
believe
that
by
bringing
different
tribes
more
frequently
together
under
similar
happy
auspices
to
those
which
convened
the
meeting
of
much
might
be
done
to
qualify
the
eager
and
deadly
hatred
in
which
they
are
too
prone
to
indulge
the
natives
in
the
town
of
perth
are
most
notorious
beggars
the
softer
sex
ply
this
easy
craft
even
more
indefatigably
than
the
men
their
flattering
solicitations
and
undeniable
importunity
seldom
altogether
fail
of
success
and
quibra
ship
man
after
the
assurance
that
he
is
a
very
pretty
gentleman
must
perforce
yield
to
the
solicitation
tickpence
give
it
um
me
there
was
one
amongst
them
who
from
some
accident
had
lost
several
of
his
toes
when
in
conversation
if
he
fancied
any
person
was
observing
his
foot
he
would
immediately
endeavour
to
conceal
the
part
that
was
thus
disfigured
by
burying
it
in
the
sand
another
instance
exemplifying
how
prevalent
is
the
frailty
of
vanity
in
the
heart
of
man
in
his
primitive
condition
visit
york
as
a
little
time
was
required
to
give
the
ship
a
slight
refit
and
the
crew
some
relaxation
it
afforded
an
opportunity
of
visiting
york
situated
about
sixty
miles
east
from
perth
and
at
that
extremity
of
the
colony
accordingly
one
murky
afternoon
a
small
party
of
us
were
wending
our
way
over
the
darling
range
long
after
dark
the
welcome
bark
of
dogs
rang
through
the
forest
in
the
still
dark
night
assuring
us
that
shelter
was
at
hand
and
we
soon
found
ourselves
before
a
large
fire
in
the
only
house
on
the
road
enjoying
after
a
dreary
wet
ride
the
usual
fare
at
that
time
at
the
fried
pork
and
kangaroo
about
this
tenement
was
the
only
spot
of
land
along
the
whole
line
of
road
that
could
at
all
lay
claim
to
anything
like
fertility
at
which
i
was
the
more
surprised
as
our
route
intercepted
the
direction
in
which
patches
of
good
land
are
generally
found
in
this
part
of
the
continent
the
soil
of
this
little
piece
was
of
a
rich
black
mould
and
well
watered
by
a
neighbouring
spring
our
road
lay
in
some
places
over
tracts
of
loose
white
sand
and
in
others
round
and
over
low
ironstone
hills
descending
from
one
of
these
heights
to
a
rich
narrow
flat
the
presence
of
three
or
four
houses
informed
us
we
were
within
the
township
of
york
the
position
of
the
level
it
occupies
forms
the
western
bank
of
the
river
avon
which
is
now
and
has
been
for
some
time
past
nothing
more
than
a
chain
of
waterholes
in
this
neighbourhood
the
hills
lie
detached
from
one
another
in
irregular
directions
and
are
composed
of
granite
from
the
summit
of
one
on
the
western
side
of
the
town
we
looked
over
a
vast
expanse
of
undulating
forest
land
densely
wooded
with
scarcely
a
grassy
patch
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
view
to
give
an
idea
of
the
personal
labour
early
settlers
are
obliged
to
undergo
i
may
mention
that
we
found
mr
bland
the
most
wealthy
colonist
in
western
australia
engaged
in
holding
the
plough
i
was
disappointed
in
my
visit
to
this
part
of
the
country
as
it
did
not
leave
a
favourable
impression
of
its
fertility
still
it
afforded
me
an
opportunity
of
judging
by
comparison
of
the
quality
of
the
soils
in
western
australia
and
on
the
banks
of
the
fitzroy
and
i
was
happy
to
find
i
had
not
overrated
the
latter
the
odium
of
a
recent
murder
in
the
vicinity
committed
by
natives
had
led
to
their
absenting
themselves
just
now
from
york
but
a
few
of
their
numbers
too
young
for
suspicion
were
employed
in
the
capacity
of
servants
and
appeared

and
intelligent
lads

on
the
of
june
we
took
leave
of
our
friends
in
western
australia
proceeding
out
of
owen
anchorage
by
a
passage
recommended
by
the
in
which
we
found
half
a
fathom
less
water
than
the
one
through
which
we
entered
during
our
stay
there
nothing
could
exceed
the
kindness
with
which
we
were
welcomed
and
we
experienced
that
proverbial
hospitality
of
colonists
which
in
this
instance
we
shall
ever
remember
with
feelings
of
the
most
sincere
and
pleasure
it
may
appear
out
of
place
inserting
it
here
but
on
our
first
arrival
at
swan
river
in
november
last
we
saw
the
aurora
australis
very
bright
at
midnight
of
the
of
june
we
passed
cape
leeuwin
the
extremity
of
the
continent
named
by
the
first
discoverer
in
landt
van
de
leeuwin
or
the
land
of
lions
the
wind
which
had
increased
since
the
morning
to
a
fresh
gale
from
the
northward
now
suddenly
veered
round
to
the
westward
accompanied
with
rain
and
causing
a
high
gale
off
cape
leeuwin
these
sudden
shifts
of
wind
frequently
raise
a
very
dangerous
sea
off
cape
leeuwin
this
made
the
third
gale
we
had
experienced
since
the
of
may
and
is
recorded
here
from
its
commencing
at
instead
of
at
north
the
usual
point
at
which
gales
in
these
regions
begin
during
the
stormy
weather
which
prevailed
throughout
the
passage
we
were
unceasingly
attended
by
those
majestic
birds
and
monarchs
of
the
ocean
the
white
albatross
diomedia
exulans
which
with
steadily
expanded
wings
sailed
gracefully
over
the
surface
of
the
restless
main
in
solemn
silence
like
spectres
of
the
deep
their
calm
and
easy
flight
coursing
each
wave
in
its
hurried
career
seemed
to
mock
the
unsteady
motion
of
our
little
vessel
as
she
alternately
traversed
the
deep
hollows
and
lofty
summits
of
the
seas
in
a
gale
off
this
cape
in
zebra
was
compelled
to
throw
her
guns
overboard
july
it
was
our
intention
to
have
passed
through
bass
strait
but
finding
we
were
unable
to
weather
king
island
bore
up
on
the
for
hobart
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
we
were
by
a
sudden
change
of
the
wind
placed
in
one
of
those
perilous
situations
in
which
both
a
good
ship
and
sound
gear
are
so
much
required
the
wind
which
had
been
northerly
throughout
the
day
about
veered
round
to
west
blowing
a
heavy
gale
with
a
high
sea
and
since
we
had
now
run
about
halfway
along
van
diemen
land
left
us
with
an
extensive
and
dangerous
shore
under
our
lee
through
the
dismal
gloom
of
the
night
during
which
there
was
incessant
rain
with
a
succession
of
heavy
squalls
the
angry
voice
of
nature
seemed
indeed
to
be
raised
in
menace
against
us
and
it
was
not
until
the
close
of
the
next
day
that
a
slight
abatement
of
the
weather
relieved
our
anxiety
for
the
safety
of
the
ship
during
the
night
the
wind
backed
round
to
the
and
the
sky
became
once
more
partially
clear
early
on
the
morning
of
the
we
descried
the
extremity
of
the
land
of
van
diemen
discovered
in
by
the
celebrated
dutch
navigator
abel
tasman
and
so
named
by
him
after
the
governor
of
batavia
under
whose
authority
the
voyage
thus
crowned
with
success
had
been
performed
tasmania
to
this
portion
of
australasia
i
shall
systematically
apply
the
name
of
tasmania
in
honour
of
that
adventurous
seaman
who
first
added
it
to
the
list
of
european
discoveries
the
same
principle
appears
to
have
been
recently
acted
upon
by
the
government
in
creating
the
bishopric
of
tasmania
and
i
may
therefore
plead
high
authority
to
sanction
such
innovation
higher
perhaps
than
will
be
required
by
him
who
calls
to
mind
that
hitherto
the
navigator
who
added
this
island
and
the
scarcely
less
important
ones
of
new
zealand
to
the
empire
of
science
has
been
left
without
a
memorial
the
most
befitting
and
the
most
lasting
that
universal
gratitude
can
consecrate
to
individual
desert
the
insular
character
of
tasmania
was
not
fully
ascertained
till
the
year
when
the
intrepid
bass
then
surgeon
of
reliance
while
on
a
whaleboat
cruise
from
sydney
discovered
the
strait
which
bears
his
name
greenough
late
president
of
the
geological
society
in
his
anniversary
address
to
that
body
on
the
of
may
remarks
that
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
government
has
not
recognised
tasmania
as
the
name
of
that
island
improperly
denominated
van
land
the
occurrence
of
a
second
van
diemen
land
on
the
northern
coast
of
australia
occasions
confusion
and
since
tasman
not
van
diemen
was
the
first
discoverer
of
the
island
it
would
be
but
just
that
whatever
honour
the
name
confers
should
be
given
to
the
former
navigator
journal
of
the
royal
geographical
society
of
london
volume
part
cape
towards
steering
east
by
south
before
a
long
rolling
sea
we
passed
about
six
miles
from
the
cape
of
tasmania
there
was
no
opportunity
at
the
time
of
determining
exactly
the
amount
of
error
in
the
position
assigned
to
it
in
the
present
charts
but
we
were
satisfied
that
it
was
placed
at
least
five
miles
too
far
south
the
maatzuyker
isles
a
group
a
few
miles
to
the
of
this
cape
are
also
incorrectly
laid
down
the
view
of
this
headland
was
of
a
very
impressive
and
remarkable
character
and
to
add
to
the
usual
effect
of
its
lonely
and
solitary
grandeur
a
heavy
sea
still
vexed
and
swelling
from
the
turbulence
of
the
recent
gale
was
breaking
in
monotonous
regularity
against
its
white
and
aged
face
rising
a
thousand
feet
precipitously
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
terminating
in
a
peak
rendered
yet
more
conspicuous
by
a
deep
gap
behind
it
the
adjacent
coast
had
a
singularly
wild
bare
and
appearance
we
beheld
the
rugged
and
treeless
sides
of
barren
hills
and
here
and
there
where
vegetation
struggled
with
sterility
its
stunted
growth
and
northern
inclination
caused
by
the
prevailing
winds
testified
to
an
ungenial
clime
high
peaks
appeared
occasionally
through
the
thick
clouds
that
girdled
them
and
the
whole
coastline
forcibly
reminded
us
of
the
dreary
shores
of
tierra
del
fuego
bruny
island
lighthouse
on
opening
channel
we
observed
a
splendid
lighthouse
erected
by
sir
john
franklin
on
the
extremity
of
bruny
island
and
which
serves
to
guide
entering
vessels
clear
of
the
shoals
in
the
mouth
of
that
channel
formerly
fatal
to
so
many
a
luckless
voyager
wrecked
within
sight
of
the
shore
upon
which
he
might
never
set
his
foot
the
situation
of
the
lighthouse
appears
admirably
chosen
and
it
may
readily
be
seen
in
the
daytime
a
wide
gap
being
cut
in
the
woodland
behind
it
in
alluding
to
the
great
improvement
in
the
navigation
of
channel
by
the
erection
of
the
lighthouse
on
bruny
island
it
must
be
remembered
that
we
are
indebted
to
the
indefatigable
exertions
of
lieutenant
burnett
who
had
been
appointed
marine
surveyor
to
the
colony
by
the
admiralty
for
a
knowledge
of
the
exact
position
of
its
dangers
in
prosecuting
this
service
i
grieve
to
say
his
life
was
lost
by
the
upsetting
of
a
boat
in
one
of
those
sudden
gusts
of
wind
which
sweep
down
the
steep
valleys
on
the
sides
of
that
channel
this
sudden
termination
of
lieutenant
labours
has
been
deplored
alike
by
the
colony
and
by
the
profession
of
which
he
was
so
bright
an
ornament
we
entered
storm
bay
after
dark
against
a
strong
wind
which
quite
vindicated
the
title
of
the
bay
to
the
name
it
bears
and
so
much
delayed
our
progress
that
it
was
morning
before
we
were
abreast
of
the
iron
pot
lighthouse
at
the
entrance
of
the
derwent
river
and
after
dark
before
we
reached
sullivan
cove
hobart
although
the
passage
up
the
river
was
tedious
and
annoying
from
the
adverse
and
squally
wind
that
prevailed
throughout
the
day
we
were
almost
repaid
for
the
delay
by
the
scenery
each
tack
brought
to
our
view
and
to
which
the
remembered
aspect
of
the
shores
we
had
so
recently
quitted
seemed
by
contrast
to
add
a
yet
more
delightful
verdure
as
we
proceeded
we
noticed
since
our
last
visit
several
bare
patches
in
the
woodlands
where
the
axe
and
the
brand
of
the
enterprising
colonists
had
prepared
the
way
for
that
cultivation
under
the
influence
of
which
the
landscape
wore
in
places
an
almost
english
aspect
this
fancied
resemblance
inspiring
by
turns
delightful
anticipation
and
fond
regret
was
heightened
by
the
occasional
addition
of
many
pretty
little
cottages
scattered
along
the
sloping
banks
of
the
river
and
adding
to
the
luxuriant
appearance
of
the
country
the
peaceful
grace
and
sanctity
of
home
july
we
were
detained
at
hobart
till
the
the
bad
state
of
the
weather
rendering
it
impossible
to
complete
the
requisite
observations
for
rating
chronometers
etc
mount
wellington
we
had
two
or
three
snowstorms
during
the
time
but
even
in
fine
weather
the
proximity
of
mount
wellington
towering
above
hobart
and
throwing
its
strange
shadow
across
the
still
waters
of
cove
must
always
render
fort
mulgrave
an
unfavourable
spot
for
observations
from
its
arresting
the
progress
of
each
passing
cloud
the
pleasure
of
our
return
was
very
much
enhanced
by
the
kind
hospitality
with
which
we
were
received
by
the
inhabitants
and
the
officers
of
her
majesty
regiment
from
sir
john
franklin
the
governor
we
experienced
all
the
attention
and
courtesy
all
the
frank
and
generous
hospitality
which
it
was
in
his
power
to
bestow
had
we
been
without
the
claims
of
previous
acquaintance
to
have
recommended
us
to
his
best
offices
the
fact
that
our
voyage
was
intended
to
advance
the
cause
of
science
would
have
been
quite
sufficient
to
interest
in
our
welfare
one
who
has
achieved
a
reputation
as
enduring
as
it
is
honourable
amid
the
perils
and
trials
connected
with
an
arctic
campaign
of
discovery
the
unfavourable
state
of
the
weather
also
prevented
us
from
visiting
and
enjoying
the
alpine
scenery
in
the
neighbourhood
of
hobart
kangaroo
hunt
we
did
however
get
a
few
miles
from
the
town
upon
one
occasion
when
the
of
a
gentleman
gregson
who
will
be
long
remembered
in
the
colony
for
his
pedestrian
and
equestrian
performances
met
in
the
neighbourhood
to
hunt
the
kangaroo
a
thoroughly
english
appreciation
of
all
that
promised
sport
led
a
large
party
of
us
to
join
the
meet
at
a
place
called
the
neck
the
turnout
was
by
no
means
despicable
the
hounds
were
well
bred
though
rather
small
perhaps
an
advantage
in
the
sort
of
country
over
which
their
work
lies
a
tolerable
muster
of
red
coats
gave
life
and
animation
to
the
scene
and
forcibly
reminded
us
of
a
coverside
at
home
the
hounds
found
a
large
kangaroo
almost
immediately
upon
throwing
off
and
went
away
with
him
in
good
earnest
there
was
a
burning
scent
and
from
the
nature
of
the
country
over
which
we
went
for
some
distance
without
a
check
the
riding
was
really
desperate
the
country
was
thickly
wooded
with
open
spaces
here
and
there
in
which
fallen
trees
lay
half
hidden
by
long
grass
riding
to
the
hounds
was
therefore
as
necessary
as
dangerous
for
once
out
of
sight
it
was
almost
impossible
to
overtake
or
fall
in
with
them
most
of
the
field
rode
boldly
and
well
yet
i
remarked
one
or
two
casualties
early
in
the
run
a
gentleman
was
swept
off
his
horse
by
the
projecting
branch
of
a
tree
under
which
he
was
going
at
a
reckless
pace
and
another
had
his
hat
perforated
immediately
above
the
crown
of
his
head
yet
notwithstanding
the
annoyance
of
ferrying
our
horses
across
the
derwent
we
returned
to
hobart
very
much
pleased
with
the
day
sport
in
the
first
volume
of
the
tasmanian
journal
will
be
found
an
animated
description
of
with
these
hounds
by
the
honourable
elliot
who
mentions
that
on
one
occasion
a
large
kangaroo
gave
them
a
run
of
eighteen
miles
white
kangaroo
in
a
gentleman
house
there
i
saw
for
the
first
time
a
specimen
of
an
albino
or
white
variety
of
kangaroo
halmaturus
bennettii
another
object
that
interested
me
greatly
was
a
quarry
of
travertine
limestone
in
the
neighbourhood
of
hobart
where
i
saw
the
of
leaves
of
plants
not
in
existence
at
present
and
of
a
few
shells
of
ancient
species
one
of
this
rare
kind
was
presented
by
sir
john
franklin
to
her
majesty
in
whose
menagerie
at
windsor
it
died
and
was
sent
afterwards
to
the
british
museum
where
it
now
may
be
seen
drawings
of
these
impressions
together
with
the
shells
will
be
found
in
count
strzelecki
scientific
work
sail
from
hobart
we
sailed
from
hobart
on
the
of
july
and
carried
a
strong
fair
wind
to
within
a
few
days
sail
of
sydney
when
we
experienced
a
current
that
set
us
miles
in
hours
this
was
the
more
extraordinary
as
we
did
not
feel
it
before
and
scarcely
afterwards
and
our
course
being
parallel
to
the
shore
was
not
likely
to
have
brought
us
suddenly
within
the
influence
of
the
currents
said
to
prevail
along
the
coast
the
ship
position
was
miles
east
of
jervis
bay
when
we
first
met
it
july
this
morning
the
clearness
of
the
atmosphere
enabled
us
at
an
elevation
of
feet
to
distinguish
the
light
near
the
entrance
of
sydney
harbour
while
at
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
from
it
its
site
has
been
admirably
chosen
for
indicating
the
position
of
the
port
from
a
distance
at
sea
but
it
has
been
placed
too
far
from
the
entrance
to
be
of
much
service
to
vessels
when
close
in
shore
the
low
land
in
the
vicinity
of
sydney
and
botany
bay
presents
a
striking
contrast
with
the
coast
of
the
illawarra
district
a
little
further
southwards
where
the
sea
washes
the
base
of
a
lofty
range
of
hills
which
sweeping
round
some
distance
in
the
rear
of
the
two
former
places
leaves
an
extensive
tract
of
low
country
between
them
and
the
sea
upon
the
summit
of
these
hills
there
rest
almost
invariably
huge
clouds
which
serve
even
through
the
gloom
of
the
darkest
night
to
assure
the
anxious
navigator
of
his
position
some
years
since
a
ship
with
convicts
was
driven
at
night
by
a
gale
close
in
with
the
light
and
was
obliged
to
run
for
the
harbour
but
being
then
without
anything
to
guide
her
into
the
entrance
was
wrecked
on
the
south
point
the
loss
of
life
was
dreadful
the
light
lately
erected
near
the
sow
and
pigs
reef
has
in
some
measure
remedied
the
evil
here
pointed
out
but
being
too
far
within
and
on
the
south
side
of
the
entrance
it
is
not
made
out
till
with
southerly
winds
a
ship
has
approached
dangerously
close
to
the
north
head
approach
to
sydney
on
approaching
sydney
a
stranger
can
not
fail
of
being
delighted
with
his
first
glance
at
the
noble
estuary
which
spreads
before
and
around
him
after
sailing
along
a
coastline
of
cliffs
some
feet
in
height
and
in
general
effect
and
outline
not
unlike
those
of
dover
he
observes
an
apparent
breach
in
the
forming
two
abrupt
headlands
and
ere
he
has
time
to
speculate
upon
the
cause
of
that
fancied
ruin
his
ship
glides
between
the
cliffs
into
the
magnificent
harbour
of
port
jackson
the
view
which
solicits
the
eye
of
the
voyager
as
he
proceeds
up
the
harbour
is
indeed
well
calculated
to
excite
a
feeling
of
mingled
admiration
and
delight
the
security
and
capacity
of
the
port
its
many
snug
coves
and
quiet
islets
with
their
sloping
shores
sleeping
upon
the
silver
tide
pretty
white
cottages
and
many
villas
peeping
out
here
and
there
from
their
surrounding
shrubberies
and
the
whole
canopied
by
a
sky
of
ethereal
blue
present
a
picture
which
must
at
once
enchant
the
most
fastidious
observer
we
found
lying
in
the
famous
cove
of
sydney
alligator
and
britomart
commanded
by
captain
sir
gordon
bremer
and
lieutenant
now
captain
owen
stanley
going
to
form
a
settlement
at
port
essington
on
the
north
coast
an
expedition
of
much
interest
particularly
to
us
from
having
some
old
shipmates
engaged
in
it
contrast
with
south
america
on
first
arriving
at
sydney
from
south
america
i
was
much
struck
with
the
strange
contrast
its
extensive
and
at
the
same
time
youthful
appearance
presented
to
the
decrepit
and
decaying
aspect
of
the
cities
on
that
continent
we
had
then
been
visiting
colonies
and
settlements
founded
centuries
ago
by
a
nation
at
that
time
almost
supreme
in
european
influence
and
planted
with
every
circumstance
of
apparent
advantage
upon
the
shores
of
a
fertile
and
luxurious
continent
given
by
the
immortal
genoese
to
the
crown
of
spain
we
had
found
them
distracted
by
internal
commotions
disgraced
by
ignorance
debased
by
superstition
and
defiled
by
slavery
colonisation
in
sydney
we
beheld
with
wonder
what
scarce
half
a
century
had
sufficed
to
effect
for
where
almost
within
the
memory
of
man
the
savage
ranged
the
desert
wastes
and
trackless
forests
a
noble
city
has
sprung
as
though
by
magic
from
the
ground
which
will
ever
serve
both
as
a
monument
of
english
enterprise
and
as
a
beacon
from
whence
the
light
of
christian
civilisation
shall
spread
through
the
dark
and
gloomy
recesses
of
ignorance
and
guilt
the
true
history
of
our
australian
possessions
the
causes
which
have
led
to
their
settlement
the
means
by
which
they
have
been
established
the
circumstances
by
which
they
have
been
influenced
and
the
rapid
nay
unexampled
prosperity
to
which
they
have
attained
present
some
of
the
most
curious
and
most
important
laws
of
colonisation
to
our
notice
without
attempting
so
far
to
deviate
from
my
present
purpose
as
to
enter
here
on
a
deduction
from
the
data
to
which
i
have
alluded
it
can
not
be
denied
that
in
the
words
of
an
eloquent
writer
in
blackwood
a
great
experiment
in
the
faculty
of
renovation
in
the
human
character
has
found
its
field
in
the
solitudes
of
this
vast
continent
that
the
experiment
has
succeeded
to
a
most
unexampled
and
unexpected
degree
and
that
the
question
is
now
finally
decided
between
severity
and
discipline
what
else
remains
what
great
designs
and
unfathomed
purposes
are
yet
reserved
to
grace
this
distant
theatre
i
pause
not
now
to
guess
the
boldest
conjecture
would
probably
fall
very
far
short
of
the
truth
it
is
sufficient
for
us
to
know
that
providence
has
entrusted
to
england
a
new
empire
in
the
southern
seas
nor
can
we
doubt
that
there
as
elsewhere
throughout
the
various
regions
of
the
habitable
globe
the
same
indomitable
spirit
which
has
achieved
so
many
successes
will
accompany
those
whom
heaven
has
appointed
as
pioneers
in
that
march
of
moral
regeneration
and
sound
improvement
long
promised
to
the
repentant
children
of
earth
quarantine
establishment
we
were
sorry
to
find
that
it
had
been
necessary
to
form
a
quarantine
establishment
in
the
north
harbour
in
consequence
of
the
diseases
brought
to
the
country
by
emigrant
ships
a
number
of
tombstones
whitening
the
side
of
a
hill
mark
the
locality
and
afford
a
melancholy
evidence
of
the
short
sojourn
in
the
land
of
promise
which
has
been
vouchsafed
to
some
expedition
to
port
essington
it
not
being
the
favourable
season
for
commencing
operations
in
bass
strait
we
remained
at
sydney
until
november
and
embraced
the
opportunity
of
clearing
out
the
ship
our
stay
was
undiversified
with
incidents
and
it
may
as
well
therefore
be
briefly
passed
over
among
the
few
occurrences
worth
mentioning
was
the
departure
of
the
expedition
sent
out
to
form
a
settlement
at
port
essington
on
the
northern
coast
its
object
was
simply
military
occupation
it
having
been
deemed
advisable
about
that
time
to
assert
practically
the
supremacy
of
great
britain
over
the
continent
by
occupying
some
of
its
most
prominent
points
but
as
soon
as
its
destination
became
known
in
the
colony
several
persons
came
forward
as
and
expressed
the
greatest
anxiety
to
be
allowed
to
accompany
the
expedition
their
views
extended
to
the
establishment
of
a
trade
with
the
islands
in
the
arafura
sea
and
certainly
they
would
have
been
far
more
likely
to
draw
forth
the
resources
of
the
country
than
a
garrison
whose
supplies
are
brought
to
them
from
a
distance
whose
presence
holds
out
no
inducement
to
traders
and
who
are
not
impelled
by
any
anxiety
for
their
own
support
to
discover
the
riches
of
the
soil
for
these
reasons
the
determination
of
government
not
to
throw
open
the
lands
and
their
refusal
to
hold
out
the
promise
of
protection
to
the
individuals
who
expressed
a
desire
to
accompany
the
expedition
are
greatly
to
be
regretted
in
a
vast
continent
like
australia
so
remarkably
destitute
of
fixed
inhabitants
it
would
seem
that
every
encouragement
should
be
afforded
to
persons
desirous
of
locating
themselves
on
unoccupied
tracts
there
is
a
great
difference
besides
between
giving
rise
to
delusive
hopes
inducing
people
as
it
were
under
false
pretences
to
repair
to
new
settlements
and
checking
the
spirit
of
colonisation
when
it
manifests
itself
every
young
establishment
must
go
through
a
certain
process
it
is
necessary
that
some
should
pioneer
the
way
for
others
and
endure
hardships
the
beneficial
results
of
which
may
be
enjoyed
only
by
their
successors
had
advantage
been
taken
of
the
enterprising
spirit
that
prevailed
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
the
germs
of
a
fresh
settlement
would
have
been
deposited
at
port
essington
which
must
ultimately
have
risen
into
importance
a
great
stream
of
emigration
was
pouring
into
the
portion
of
australia
and
it
would
have
been
wise
to
open
a
channel
by
which
some
portion
of
it
might
have
been
drawn
off
to
the
northern
coast
but
such
were
not
the
views
entertained
by
the
authorities
concerning
this
matter
they
seemed
apprehensive
of
incurring
the
blame
of
encouraging
the
speculating
mania
which
raged
so
extensively
at
sydney
and
which
has
reacted
with
so
pernicious
an
effect
upon
the
colony
the
expedition
accordingly
retained
its
purely
military
character
however
i
may
add
that
the
bishop
of
australia
attended
to
the
spiritual
wants
of
the
settlement
by
sending
with
it
a
church
in
frame
on
our
arrival
at
sydney
in
we
found
speculation
at
its
height
were
carrying
on
a
reckless
and
most
gainful
trade
utterly
regardless
of
that
revulsion
they
were
doomed
soon
to
experience
town
allotments
that
cost
originally
but
pounds
were
in
some
instances
sold
three
months
afterwards
for
ten
times
that
sum
yet
amid
all
this
appearance
of
excessive
and
unnatural
prosperity
there
were
not
wanting
those
who
foresaw
and
foretold
an
approaching
change
to
the
withdrawal
of
the
convicts
solely
at
the
expressed
wish
of
some
of
the
most
wealthy
colonists
has
been
traced
much
of
the
decline
that
followed
and
the
more
recent
pages
in
the
history
of
sydney
will
fully
bear
out
the
opinions
expressed
by
captain
fitzroy
when
he
visited
it
in
he
says
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
sydney
will
continue
to
flourish
in
proportion
to
its
rise
it
has
sprung
into
existence
too
suddenly
convicts
have
forced
its
growth
even
as
a
hot
bed
forces
plants
and
premature
decay
may
be
expected
from
such
early
maturity
botany
bay
during
our
stay
at
sydney
we
paid
a
visit
to
botany
bay
which
from
the
circumstance
of
its
being
the
point
first
touched
at
by
captain
cook
naturally
possesses
the
greatest
interest
of
any
place
in
the
neighbourhood
our
way
thither
lay
over
a
sandy
plain
into
which
the
coast
range
of
low
hills
subsides
there
is
little
or
no
verdure
to
relieve
the
eye
which
encounters
aridity
wherever
it
turns
and
the
sand
being
rendered
loose
by
frequent
traffic
the
foot
sinks
at
every
step
so
that
the
journey
is
disagreeable
to
both
man
and
beast
these
inconveniences
however
were
soon
forgotten
on
our
arrival
at
our
destination
amidst
the
feelings
excited
and
the
associations
raised
by
the
objects
that
presented
themselves

the
last
spot
at
which
the
distinguished
navigator
was
heard
of
from
until
when
the
chevalier
dillon
was
furnished
with
a
clue
to
his
melancholy
fate
by
finding
the
handle
of
a
french
sword
fastened
to
another
blade
in
the
possession
of
a
native
of
tucopia
one
of
the

group
by
this
means
he
was
enabled
to

and
died
at
this
great

from

a
large
stump

out
the
sad
spot
where
lie
mouldering
the
bones
of
the
wanderer
in
search

to

of

no

many
a
hope
of

fame
expired
in

as
he
sank
into
his
last
sleep
in
a
foreign
clime
far
from
his
home
and
friends
and
relations
such
as
his
order
allowed
him
to
possess
the
applause
of
the
world
which
doubtless
he
fancied
would
have
greeted
his
labours
at
the
end
of
his
perilous
journey
he
was
now
robbed
of
and
he
must
have
felt
that
few
would
ever
recollect
his
name
save
the
rare
voyager
who
like
myself
having
encountered
the
same
dangers
that
he
had
braved
should
chance
to
read
his
short
history
on
the
narrow
page
of
stone
that
rests
above
his
grave

another
object
of
greater
interest
to
the
englishman
is
observable
on

the
opposite
point
of
the
bay
it
is
a
plate
set
in
the
rock
recording
the
first
visit
of
the
immortal
cook
to
whose
enterprise
the
colonists
are
indebted
for
the
land
that
yields
them
their
riches
and
which
must
now
be
invested
in
their
eyes
with
all
the
sanctity
of
home
surely
it
would
become
them
to
evince
a
more
filial
reverence
for
the
man
who
must
be
regarded
as
in
some
respects
the
father
of
the
colony
let
us
hope
that
they
will
one
day
raise
a
monument
to
his
memory
which
to
be
worthy
of
him
must
be
worthy
of
themselves
something
to
point
out
to
future
generations
the
spot
at
which
the
first
white
man
foot
touched
the
shore
and
where
civilisation
was
first
brought
in
contact
with
the
new
continent
illawarra
but
though
botany
bay
is
interesting
from
the
associations
connected
with
it
i
am
quite
serious
though
the
expression
may
raise
a
smile
on
some
of
my
readers
lips
the
tract
of
country
best
worth
seeing
in
the
neighbourhood
of
sydney
is
illawarra
commonly
called
the
garden
of
new
south
wales
by
a
change
in
the
formation
from
sandstone
to
trap
a
soil
this
here
produced
capable
of
supporting
a
vegetation
equal
in
luxuriance
to
any
within
the
tropics
in
the
deep
valleys
that
intersect
the
country
the
attains
a
great
stature
and
throwing
out
its
rich
spreading
fronds
on
all
sides
forms
a
canopy
that
perfectly
excludes
the
piercing
rays
of
even
an
australian
sun
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
feelings
of
surprise
and
pleasure
that
are
excited
in
the
mind
of
the
traveller
as
he
descends
into
any
one
of
these
delightful
dells
the
contrast
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
strikes
him
at
once
he
gazes
around
on
the
rich
masses
of
verdure
with
astonishment
and
strongly
impressed
with
the
idea
that
enchantment
has
been
at
work
involuntarily
rubs
his
eyes
and
exclaims
am
i
in
australia
or
in
the
brazils
aborigines
few
only
of
the
aborigines
of
the
neighbourhood
of
sydney
are
now
to
be
seen
and
these
are
generally
in
an
intoxicated
state
like
most
savage
tribes
they
are
passionately
addicted
to
spiritous
liquors
and
seek
to
obtain
it
by
any
means
in
their
power
out
of
a
sugar
bag
with
a
little
water
they
manage
to
extract
a
liquor
sufficient
to
make
half
a
dozen
of
them
tipsy
and
in
this
condition
as
i
have
observed
they
most
frequently
presented
themselves
to
my
view
they
are
in
every
respect
a
weak
degraded
miserable
race
and
are
anything
but
a
favourable
specimen
of
the
benefits
produced
by
intercourse
with
polished
nations
on
an
uncivilised
people
however
the
natives
of
australia
vary
as
strangely
as
its
soil
the
members
of
the
tribes
that
dwell
about
shoalhaven
and
the
small
southern
ports
and
come
up
in
coasting
vessels
are
useful
fellows
and
may
hereafter
be
made
much
of
i
noticed
also
in
my
circumnavigation
of
the
continent
a
remarkable
diversity
in
the
character
of
the
natives
some
being
most
kindly
disposed
while
others
manifested
the
greatest
hostility
and
aversion
my
whole
experience
teaches
me
that
these
were
not
accidental
differences
but
that
there
is
a
marked
contrast
in
the
dispositions
of
the
various
tribes
for
which
i
will
not
attempt
to
account
i
leave
in
the
hands
of
ethnologists
to
determine
whether
we
are
to
seek
the
cause
in
minute
variations
of
climate
or
in
other
circumstances
physical
or
historical
this
i
can
say
that
great
pains
were
formerly
taken
to
civilize
the
natives
of
sydney
gardens
were
given
them
and
numerous
attempts
made
to
inculcate
habits
of
order
and
communicate
a
knowledge
of
european
arts
but
no
advantageous
results
ensued
and
it
was
at
length
deemed
impossible
not
only
to
improve
them
but
even
to
prevent
their
deterioration
i
can
not
determine
whether
this
evinces
a
natural
inaptitude
in
the
savage
to
learn
or
too
great
impatience
in
the
teachers
to
witness
the
fruits
of
their
labours
and
a
proneness
to
be
discouraged
by
difficulties
is
this
grass
in
the
journal
of
my
residence
at
sydney
i
find
as
the
result
of
one
day
experience
the
following
laconic
and
somewhat
enigmatical
memorandum
is
this
grass
the
question
implies
a
doubt
which
it
would
not
be
easy
for
any
person
unacquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
time
and
place
to
solve
but
the
reader
when
he
has
seen
the
explanation
will
understand
why
very
pleasing
associations
are
connected
with
this
brief
note
i
was
going
down
to
the
jetty
late
one
evening
when
i
met
a
party
just
landed
evidently
complete
strangers
in
this
quarter
of
the
world
their
wandering
and
unsteady
glances
would
have
convinced
me
of
this
fact
had
their
whole
appearance
left
any
doubt
about
the
matter
among
them
were
some
ladies
one
of
whom
suddenly
detached
herself
from
her
companions
and
directed
as
it
were
by
instinct
through
the
gloom
hastened
towards
a
few
sods
of
turf
pressed
them
exaltingly
with
her
foot
and
exclaimed
in
a
light
joyous
happy
voice
through
which
other
emotions
than
that
of
mere
gladness
struggled
is
this
grass
the
words
were
nothing
they
might
have
been
uttered
in
a
thousand
different
tones
and
have
not
fixed
themselves
on
my
memory
but
as
they
fell
in
accents
of
delight
and
gratitude
from
the
lips
of
the
speaker
they
told
a
whole
story
and
revealed
an
entire
world
of
feeling
never
shall
i
forget
the
simple
expression
of
this
newcomer
whose
emotions
on
first
feeling
the
solid
earth
beneath
her
tread
and
touching
a
remembrance
of
the
land
she
had
left
in
quest
of
another
home
will
be
incomprehensible
to
no
one
who
has
crossed
the
ocean
captain
king
we
met
several
persons
at

from
whom
we
received
valuable
information
and
particularly
captain
king
who
as
the
reader
may
recollect
commanded
the
first
expedition
on
which
the
beagle
was
employed
his
great
scientific
attainments
must
ever
attach
respect
to
his
name
and
his
explorations
on
the
australian
coast
previous
to
the
survey
in
which
we
were
engaged
together
with
his
father
services
as
governor
of
new
south
wales
give
him
and
his
children
a
lasting
claim
upon
the
country
the
information
he
furnished
on
this
and
subsequent
occasions
was
extremely
valuable
rising
of
the
australian
continent
an
observation
of
his
gave
rise
in
my
mind
to
very
curious
conjectures
he
told
me
that
where
he
used
formerly
to
anchor
the
vessel
he
commanded
in
the
head
of
sydney
cove
there
was
now
scarcely
sufficient
water
to
float
even
a
boat
as
the
deposits
of
the
small
stream
that
flows
into
it
could
not
have
produced
this
change
i
was
led
to
examine
the
shore
of
the
harbour
when
i
found
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
marks
of
the
sea
higher
than
its
present
level
this
coupled
with
the
decrease
in
the
soundings
we
found
in
darling
harbour
leads
to
the
legitimate
inference
that
this
part
of
the
continent
is
rising
and
my
reader
will
recollect
that
it
is
a
prevalent
theory
that
the

to

with
in

boisterous
waters
that
rolled
between

it
was
not
until
the
of

that
we
bade
adieu
to

sailed
to
commence
our
contemplated
operations
on
the
we
passed
the
rocky
islands
kent
group
at
the
eastern
entrance
of

their
barren
and
bleak
appearance
bespoke
the
constant
gales
that
swept
over
them
checking
every
tendency
to

as
we
approached
them
the

decreased
to
fathoms
the

apprises
vessels
coming
from

in

of
their

after
leaving

we
progressed
but
slowly
and
the
passage
through
the
strait
promised
to
be
tedious
yet
as
the
wind
was
fair
and
the
weather
fine
we
had
no
reason
to
complain
considering
moreover
the
remarkably
mild
reception
we
met
with
in
the
funnel
the
name
commonly
and
most
appropriately
given
by
the
colonists
to
bass

from
the
constant
strong
winds
that
sweep
through

wilson
promontory
on
the
we
passed
wilson
promontory
the
southern
extremity
of
australia
connected
with
the
main
by
a
low
sandy
isthmus
only
left
dry
it
is
probable
of
late
years
it
is
a
very
mountainous
tract
rearing
its
many
peaks
in
solemn
grandeur
from
the
waves
and
burying
their
at
most
seasons
of
the
year
in
a
canopy
of
grey
mist
on
some
occasions
however
the
bold
outline
of
the
mountains
is
relieved
against
a
clear
sky
and
their
loftiest
points
catch
the
first
rays
of
the
morning
sun
as
it
rises
from
the
eastern
ocean
many
small
islands
are
dispersed
over
the
sea
in
front
of
this
promontory
and
partake
of
its
character
being
apparently
the
tops
of
mountains
thrusting
themselves
up
from
the
deep
and
suggesting
the
belief
that
new
countries
are
about
to
be
disclosed
passing
port
western
generally
called
western
port
a
high
mound
on
the
extremity
of
grant
island
was
the
most
conspicuous
object
the
next
remarkable
feature
in
the
coast
is
cape
shanck
a
projection
at
the
western
end
of
a
long
line
of
cliffs
lying
close
off
it
is
a
rock
named
from
its
exact
resemblance
pulpit
rock
nearly
feet
high
port
phillip
in
a
small
bay
on
the
east
side
of
this
headland
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
some
rich
valleys
but
from
thence
for
a
distance
of
miles
the
coast
retains
a
barren
sandy
character
to
port
phillip
which
we
reached
on
the
afternoon
of
the
we
scarcely
found
any
ripplings
in
the
entrance
an
occurrence
of
extreme
rarity
for
it
will
readily
be
imagined
that
a
body
of
water
required
to
fill
a
bay
thirty
miles
deep
and
twenty
broad
passing
through
an
entrance
one
mile
and
a
half
in
width
must
rush
with
great
violence
and
when
we
take
into
account
the
extreme
unevenness
of
the
bottom
soundings
varying
from
to
and
even
fathoms
no
surprise
can
be
felt
that
such
a
stream
particularly
when
opposed
to
a
strong
wind
should
raise
a
dangerous
sea
the
force
of
it
may
be
conjectured
from
a
fact
of
which
i
was
myself
witness
standing
on
one
of
the
entrance
points
i
saw
a
schooner
trying
to
get
in
with
all
sails
set
before
a
fresh
breeze
and
yet
she
was
carried
out
by
the
current
another
observation
is
also
recorded
for
the
guidance
of
the
stranger
passing
into
the
port
when
in
the
middle
of
the
entrance
a
low
clump
of
dark
bushes
breaking
the
line
of
white
sand
beach
beyond
shortlands
bluff
was
just
seen
clear
of
the
latter
the
first
appearance
of
port
phillip
is
very
striking
and
the
effect
of
the
view
is
enhanced
by
the
contrast
with
the
turbulent
waves
without
and
in
the
entrance
as
soon
as
these
have
been
passed
a
broad
expanse
of
placid
water
displays
itself
on
every
side
and
one
might
almost
fancy
oneself
in
a
small
sea
but
the
presence
of
a
distant
highland
forming
a
bluff
in
the
soon
dispels
this
idea
besides
this
bluff
called
by
the
natives
dandonong
arthur
seat
and
station
peak
are
the
principal
features
that
catch
the
eye
of
the
stranger
the
latter
called
youang
by
the
natives
is
one
of
a
small
group
of
lofty
peaks
rising
abruptly
out
of
a
low
plain
on
the
western
shore
of
the
bay
whilst
arthur
seat
towers
over
the
eastern
shore
and
forms
the
northern
extremity
of
a
range
subsiding
gradually
to
the
coast
at
cape
shanck
anchoring
close
to
the
southern
shore
about
three
miles
within
the
entrance
we
set
to
work
in
good
earnest
with
our
surveying
operations
in
the
first
place
selecting
a
conspicuous
spot
for
observation
from
which
all
the
meridians
of
our
work
in
the
western
part
of
the
strait
were
to
be
measured
for
the
sake
of
my
nautical
readers
i
may
mention
that
the
western
extreme
of
the
cliffy
patches
on
the
south
shore
of
the
bay
marks
the
place
chosen
the
nature
of
our
employment
confining
us
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
entrance
we
had
no
opportunity
of
visiting
the
town
of
melbourne
situated
near
the
northern
side
of
the
bay
this
capital
of
australia
felix
had
for
a
long
time
been
known
to
some
squatters
from
tasmania
but
to
sir
thomas
mitchell
the
inhabitants
must
ever
feel
grateful
for
revealing
to
the
world
at
large
the
fertility
of
the
districts
in
its
neighbourhood
it
is
not
a
little
singular
that
the
attempt
to
form
a
settlement
at
this
place
in
should
have
failed
a
fort
was
built
and
abandoned
and
of
the
party
of
convicts
who
accompanied
the
expedition
two
escaped
and
joined
the
natives
by
whom
one
was
murdered
whilst
the
other
contriving
by
some
means
to
ingratiate
himself
with
them
remained
in
their
company
until
when
he
was
discovered
by
the
settlers
from
tasmania
during
the
eleven
years
he
had
passed
in
the
bush
without
coming
in
contact
with
any
other
european
he
had
entirely
forgotten
his
own
language
and
had
degenerated
into
a
perfect
savage
his
intellect
if
he
ever
possessed
much
had
almost
entirely
deserted
him
and
nothing
of
any
value
could
be
gleaned
from
him
respecting
the
history
and
manners
of
the
tribe
with
whom
he
had
so
long
dwelt
he
received
his
pardon
and
went
to
hobart
but
such
was
the
indolence
he
had
contracted
that
nothing
could
be
made
of
him
the
southern
shore
of
port
phillip
is
a
singular
long
narrow
tongue
of
land
running
out
from
the
foot
of
the
range
of
which
arthur
seat
is
the
most
conspicuous
point
i
infer
from
the
limestone
prevailing
in
it
and
containing
shells
of
recent
species
that
it
was
once
much
beneath
its
present
level
in
fact
that
it
stops
up
what
was
formerly
a
broad
mouth
of
the
bay
leaving
only
the
present
narrow
entrance
at
the
western
extremity
over
its
surface
are
scattered
hills
from
one
to
two
hundred
feet
in
height
in
the
valleys
between
which
was
found
some
light
sandy
soil
supporting
at
this
time
rich
grass
and
at
various
places
a
thin
growth
of
banksia
eucalypti
and
casuarina
all
stunted
and
showing
symptoms
of
having
been
roughly
used
by
the
south
wind
near
the
spot
we
had
chosen
for
the
centre
of
our
observations
was
a
well
of
inferior
water
and
we
did
not
find
any
better
in
the
neighbourhood
the
point
in
question
therefore
will
never
be
very
eligible
as
a
settlement
the
kangaroos
are
numerous
and
large
and
the
finest
snappers
i
have
ever
heard
of
are
caught
off
this
point
weighing
sometimes
as
much
as
thirty
pounds
our
fishing
experiments
however
were
not
very
productive
being
principally
sharks
thirteen
young
ones
were
found
in
a
single
female
of
this
species
sail

king
island
bad
weather
prolonged
our
stay
until
the
of
november
we
had
been
chiefly
occupied
in
determining
the
position
of
the
mouths
of
the
various
channels
intersecting
the
banks
that
extend
across
the
entire
bay
three
miles
within
the
entrance
the
most
available
passages
appeared
to
be
those
lying
on
the
south
and
west
shores
particularly
the
former
for
vessels
of
great
draught
but
we
did
not
conclude
the
examination
of
them
at
this
time
sailing
on
the
morning
of
the
to
survey
the
coast
to
the
westward
the
first
thirteen
miles
trending
west
by
south
was
of
a
low
sandy
character
what
seemed
to
be
a
fertile
country
stretching
behind
it
two
features
on
this
line
are
worthy
of
notice
point
flinders
resembling
an
island
from
seaward
on
account
of
the
low
land
in
its
rear
and
the
mouth
of
the
river
barwon
navigable
for
boats
entering
in
very
fine
weather
on
its
northern
bank
eight
miles
from
the
sea
is
the
site
of
the
town
of
geelong
passing
this
the
nature
of
the
country
begins
to
change
and
high
grassy
downs
with
rare
patches
of
woodland
present
themselves
which
in
their
turn
give
place
as
we
approach
cape
otway
to
a
steep
rocky
coast
with
densely
wooded
land
rising
abruptly
over
it
cape
otway
the
cape
is
the
northern
point
of
the
western
extremity
of
bass
strait
and
is
swept
by
all
the
winds
that
blow
into
that
end
of
the
funnel
the
pernicious
effect
of
these
is
evident
in
the
stunted
appearance
of
the
trees
in
its
neighbourhood
it
is
a
bold
projection
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
and
appears
to
be
the
extremity
of
a
ridge
of
granite
gradually
rising
from
it
in
a
direction
about
half
a
mile
off
it
lies
a
small
detached
reef
having
thus
coasted
the
northern
side
of
the
strait
we
proceeded
to
cross
over
to
tasmania
to
examine
the
southern
side
about
halfway
is
king
island
extending
in
a
north
and
south
direction
miles
and
in
an
east
and
west
thirteen
it
lies
right
across
the
entrance
of
the
strait
about
forty
miles
from
either
shore
and
from
its
isolated
position
is
well
adapted
for
a
penal
settlement
the
more
northern
channel
of
the
two
formed
by
this
island
is
the
safer
and
the
water
deepens
from
to
fathoms
as
you
approach
it
from
the
continent
its
outline
is
not
remarkable
the
most
conspicuous
point
being
a
round
hill
feet
high
over
the
northern
point
called
cape
wickham
we
anchored
in
a
bay
on
the
side
under
new
year
island
which
affords
shelter
for
a
few
vessels
from
all
winds
there
is
a
narrow
passage
between
the
two
but
none
between
them
and
the
southern
point
of
the
bay
which
is
open
to
the
on
the
summit
of
one
of
these
islands
boulders
of
granite
are
strewed
and
they
exhibit
a
very
remarkable
white
appearance
from
seaward
when
the
sun
has
passed
his
meridian
a
sealer
family
a
sealer
had
established
himself
on
the
north
island
with
two
wives
natives
of
tasmania
they
were
clothed
in
very
comfortable
greatcoats
made
of
kangaroo
skins
and
seemed
quite
contented
with
their
condition
their
offspring
appeared
sharp
and
intelligent
in
another
part
of
my
work
i
shall
touch
more
fully
on
the
history
of
these
sealers
who
style
themselves
residents
of
the
islands
they
further
distinguish
their
classes
by
the
names
of
eastern
and
western
according
to
the
position
of
the
islands
they
inhabit
the
sealers
on
new
year
island
had
a
large
whaleboat
which
i
was
somewhat
puzzled
to
know
how
they
managed
there
being
but
one
man
among
them
he
informed
me
however
that
his
wives
the
two
native
women
assisted
him
to
work
the
boat
which
had
been
well
prepared
for
the
rough
weather
they
have
to
encounter
in
bass
strait
by
a
canvas
which
lacing
in
the
centre
could
be
rolled
up
on
the
gunwale
in
fine
weather
the
mutton
bird
the
principal
occupation
of
these
people
during
this
month
of
the
year
is
taking
the
sooty
petrel
called
by
the
colonists
the
mutton
bird
from
a
fancied
resemblance
to
the
taste
of
that
meat
it
is
at
the
present
month
that
they
resort
to
the
island
for
the
purpose
of
incubation
they
constitute
the
chief
sustenance
of
the
sealers
who
cure
them
for
use
and
sale
their
feathers
also
form
a
considerable
article
of
trade
many
parts
of
the
island
were
perfectly
honeycombed
with
their
burrows
which
greatly
impede
the
progress
of
the
pedestrian
and
are
in
some
cases
dangerous
from
snakes
lying
in
them
the
sealers
told
me
that
they
had
lost
a
cat
which
died
within
an
hour
after
the
bite
of
one
of
these
reptiles
we
here
found
cabbages
and
water
and
the
people
informed
us
that
it
was
always
their
custom
to
plant
a
few
vegetables
on
the
islands
they
frequented
from
the
top
of
this
island
we
had
a
good
view
of
the
harbinger
reefs
from
a
convict
ship
of
that
name
which
was
lost
upon
them
and
all
hands
perished
i
was
glad
to
find
they
were
only
two
detached
rocks
lying
three
miles
and
a
half
from
the
shore
instead
of
as
reported
one
continued
reef
lying
six
or
seven
miles
from
the
land
they
bore
north
six
miles
from
our
position
captain
smith
the
sealers
informed
us
that
a
house
which
we
descried
in
the
bay
was
occupied
by
a
gentleman
who
had
met
with
a
reverse
of
fortune
we
accordingly
paid
him
a
visit
next
morning
and
found
that
he
was
a
captain
smith
with
whom
the
world
had
gone
wrong
and
who
had
accordingly
fled
as
far
as
possible
from
the
society
of
civilised
man
and
taken
up
his
residence
on
the
shores
of
king
island
with
his
family
he
had
given
the
name
of
port
franklin
to
the
bay
which
we
changed
to
franklin
road
from
its
not
being
worthy
of
the
title
of
a
port
he
was
led
to
choose
his
position
from
its
being
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
only
secure
anchorage
from
all
winds
and
near
the
best
soil
he
had
found
after
traversing
the
whole
of
the
island
according
to
his
account
it
was
totally
unfit
for
rearing
sheep
on
a
large
scale
the
bushes
and
grass
being
so
full
of
burrs
that
the
wool
was
completely
spoiled
the
soil
was
everywhere
very
inferior
and
a
few
patches
only
of
clean
land
was
to
be
found
the
principal
part
being
overrun
with
dense
scrub
and
impervious
thickets
there
were
few
elevations
on
the
island
and
those
not
of
any
great
magnitude
the
loftiest
point
being
scarcely
seven
hundred
feet
the
formation
of
the
neighbourhood
of
captain
smith
house
was
granite
water
abounds
west
side
of
king
island
the
house
in
which
this
modern
robinson
crusoe
dwelt
was
what
is
called
a
slab
hut
formed
of
rough
boards
and
thatched
with
grass
he
had
a
garden
in
which
grew
some
cabbages
and
a
few
other
vegetables
but
he
complained
sorely
of
blight
from
the
west
winds
there
are
three
varieties
of
kangaroos
on
the
island
and
plenty
of
wildfowl
on
some
of
the
lagoons
so
that
supplies
are
abundant
but
the
few
sheep
he
possessed
were
rendered
of
little
value
from
the
burrs
i
have
before
mentioned
i
could
not
help
pitying
the
condition
of
this
gentleman
and
his
interesting
family
a
wife
and
daughter
and
three
or
four
fine
boys
they
had
retained
a
few
of
the
tastes
and
habits
of
civilized
life
and
i
observed
a
good
library
with
a
flute
and
music
in
the
slab
hut
it
was
with
great
pleasure
that
i
afterwards
learned
that
captain
smith
prospects
had
brightened
he
is
now
i
believe
a
comfortable
settler
on
the
eastern
side
of
tasmania
on
the
we
passed
down
the
western
shore
of
king
island
finding
the
coast
to
be
low
treacherous
and
rocky
we
discovered
some
outlying
rocks
a
mile
and
half
from
shore
and
about
eleven
miles
south
from
new
year
island
the
most
remarkable
circumstance
we
noticed
in
this
part
of
our
cruise
was
the
leafless
appearance
of
the
trees
on
the
higher
parts
of
the
island
it
seemed
as
though
a
hurricane
had
stripped
them
of
their
verdure
they
reminded
me
strongly
of
a
wintry
day
in
the
north
about
eight
miles
from
the
extremity
of
the
island
we
discovered
a
bay
affording
good
anchorage
in
east
winds
it
was
afterwards
called
fitzmaurice
bay
from
its
neighbourhood
a
long
dark
line
of
black
cliffs
stretches
southward
until
within
about
three
miles
of
the
point
when
the
ground
sinks
suddenly
whence
vessels
are
apt
to
be
misled
and
to
fancy
that
the
island
ends
there
whilst
in
reality
it
stretches
out
into
a
low
dangerous
rocky
point
named
after
the
writer
for
about
three
miles
more
seal
bay
rounding
this
we
anchored
on
the
eastern
side
of
it
in
seal
bay
a
wild
anchorage
the
swell
constantly
rolling
in
with
too
much
surf
to
allow
of
our
commencing
a
series
of
tidal
observations
this
bay
in
the
mouth
of
which
lies
a
small
cluster
of
rocks
is
separated
from
the
one
on
the
opposite
side
by
a
strip
of
low
sandy
land
which
as
i
have
said
may
easily
be
overlooked
by
vessels
coming
from
the
westward
a
ship
indeed
has
been
lost
from
fancying
that
the
sea
was
clear
south
of
the
black
cliffs
that
skirt
the
shore
down
from
fitzmaurice
bay
the
wallaby
are
numerous
on
this
part
of
the
island
bynoe
shot
one
halmaturus
bellidereii
out
of
whose
pouch
he
took
a
young
one
which
he
kept
on
board
and
tamed
it
subsequently
became
a
great
pet
with
us
all
i
noticed
here
a
trappean
dyke
but
the
general
formation
of
this
end
of
king
island
exactly
corresponded
with
that
about
captain
smith
house
which
shows
that
it
is
a
continuous
ridge
of
granite
the
shore
is
rather
steep
and
the
ground
which
rises
abruptly
over
it
is
almost
denuded
of
wood
leaving
seal
bay
from
the
south
point
of
which
we
saw
the
principal
dangers
at
this
extremity
of
bass
strait
reid
rocks
bearing
east
by
south
south
miles
we
coasted
round
the
eastern
shore
and
anchored
off
a
sandy
bay
about
the
centre
of
the
island
the
only
remarkable
object
was
a
rock
lying
one
mile
from
the
shore
and
five
from
seal
bay
on
which
we
bestowed
a
name
suggested
by
its
form
brig
rock
off
the
north
point
of
the
bay
in
which
we
anchored
lies
a
white
rock
or
islet
called
sea
elephant
rock
with
a
reef
a
mile
off
its
north
point
opposite
this
is
a
small
inlet
fed
by
the
drainage
of
some
lagoons
or
swamps
behind
the
bay
northward
the
character
of
the
coast
as
far
as
we
could
see
changes
considerably
being
lower
with
a
continued
line
of
sandy
shore
a
breeze
from
the
eastward
prevented
our
completing
the
survey
of
the
northern
side
of
the
island
but
one
important
result
we
had
arrived
at
namely
that
safe
anchorage
may
be
obtained
in
west
winds
within
a
moderate
distance
of
this
part
of
the
shore
in
less
than
fifteen
fathoms
cross
the
strait
we
now
crossed
over
to
the
group
of
islands
fronting
the
point
of
tasmania
and
confining
the
southern
side
of
the
mouth
of
the
strait
the
tide
setting
to
the
at
the
rate
of
three
knots
an
brought
us
within
five
miles
of
reid
rocks
passing
at
that
distance
from
their
eastern
side
we
had
and
fathoms
sand
and
rock
and
the
greatest
depth
we
found
in
crossing
was
fathoms
towards
the
south
side
of
the
strait
this
set
of
the
tide
being
rather
across
the
channel
renders
the
passage
between
king
island
and
reid
rocks
by
no
means
recommendable
captain
king
on
returning
to
new
south
wales
used
this
passage
and
was
very
nearly
wrecked
the
set
of
the
tides
at
that
time
not
being
known
it
appears
they
saw
the
south
point
of
king
island
just
at
dark
and
shaped
a
course
well
wide
of
reid
rocks
they
found
themselves
however
drifted
by
the
tide
close
on
them
we
made
the
time
of
at
the
full
and
change
of
the
moon
in
this
entrance
of
the
strait
to
be
half
an
hour
before
noon
but
the
western
stream
began
three
hours
and
a
half
before
and
the
eastern
again
precedes
by
the
same
amount
of
time
a
secure
anchorage
early
on
the
morning
of
december
we
reached
a
secure
anchorage
between
three
hummock
island
and
hunter
formerly
called
barren
island
and
we
had
every
reason
to
be
thankful
at
finding
ourselves
in
such
a
snug
berth
for
during
our
stay
we
experienced
gales
from
east
and
west
with
such
sudden
changes
that
no
ship
could
have
saved
herself
this
made
us
sensible
how
necessary
it
was
to
choose
anchorages
sheltered
from
both
winds
our
surveying
operations
were
sadly
delayed
by
this
boisterous
weather
three
hummock
island
receives
its
name
from
three
peaks
rising
on
its
eastern
side
the
south
rises
abruptly
from
the
water
and
forms
a
singular
sugarloaf

high
it
is
composed
of
granite
boulders
of
which
front
many
of
the
points
forming
strange
figures
the
whole
of
the
island
is
clothed
with
an
almost
impervious
scrub
which
growing
laterally
forms
a
perfect
network
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
traverse
it
bynoe
procured
few
specimens
of
birds
in
consequence
the
woodcutters
one
day
cut
a
small
brown
opossum
in
half
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
rare
if
not
a
new
animal
but
unfortunately
the
head
part
could
not
be
found
small
brown
rats
were
very
numerous
they
had
rather
short
tails
with
long
hind
feet
and
sat
up
like
kangaroos
the
trees
on
this
island
are
small
and
stunted
being
chiefly
banksia
and
eucalypti
water
is
plentiful
we
supplied
the
ship
from
wells
dug
on
the
north
point
of
a
sandy
bay
on
the
side
of
the
island
the
reef
that
so
nearly
sealed
the
mermaid
fate
with
captain
king
we
found
to
lie
half
a
mile
from
the
end
of
three
hummock
island
barren
island
hunter
island
well
deserves
its
former
name
of
barren
for
it
is
perfectly
treeless
a
green
kind
of
scrub
overruns
its
surface
which
at
its
highest
point
is
three
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the

it
is

the
extended
pointing

inclination
of
its
strata
differs
dipping
to
the
sea
on
both
sides
east
and
west
these
at
first
sight
appeared
to
be
of
the
same
kind
of
sandstone
that
we
had
seen
so
much
of
on
the
coast
but
on
closer
inspection
i
found
they
were
raised
beaches
the
prevailing
mass
of
the
island
was
a
granitoid
rock
the
black
pyramid
from
stations
on
hunter
island
we
were
enabled
to
determine
the
positions
of
the
numerous
dangers
fronting
its
west
or
seaward
side
and
also
that
of
a
dark
mass
of
rock
feet
high
appropriately
named
the
black
pyramid
lying
miles
west
by
north
from
the
centre
of
the
island
and
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
which
places
it
nearly
five
miles
south
of
its
position
in
the
old
charts
it
is
quite
a
to
this
entrance
of
the
strait
and
all
ships
should
pass
close
to
it
when
i
looked
at
these
islands
and
rocks
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
poor
captain
flinders
and
his
enterprising
companion
bass
the
discoverers
of
the
part
of
tasmania
what
a
thrill
of
excitement
must
have
shot
through
their
frames
when
on
rounding
hunter
island
in
the
little
norfolk
cutter
they
first
felt
the
long
swell
of
the
ocean
and
became
convinced
of
the
insular
character
of
tasmania
this
discovery
must
have
amply
repaid
them
for
all
their
toils
and
privations
nothing
indeed
is
so
calculated
to
fill
the
heart
of
the
navigator
with
pride
as
the
consciousness
that
he
has
widened
the
sphere
of
geographical
science
and
added
new
seas
and
new
lands
to
the
known
world
the
south
end
of
hunter
island
is
about
three
miles
from
a
point
of
the
mainland
called

but
from
the
rocks
and

that
encumber
the

which
i
shall
say
more
anon
some
forty
persons
are
here
located
under
the
care
of
a
german
who
amused
himself
by
making
a
large
collection
of
insects
which
he
has
since
taken
to
germany
the
soil
on
this
extremity
of

labour
is
required
in
clearing
for
the
purposes
of

our
boats
met
the
wives
of
some
sealers
whose
husbands
had
gone
to
king
island
on
a
sealing
excursion
they
were
clothed
like
those
on

one
was
half
european
and
half
tasmanian
and
by
no
means
she
spoke
very
good
english
and
appeared
to
take
more
care
of
her
person
than
her
two
companions
who
were
aborigines
of
pure
blood
a
few
wild
flowers
were
tastefully
entwined
with
her
hair
which
was
dressed
with
some
pretensions
to
elegance
they
had
a
pack
of
dogs
along
with
them
and
depended
in
a
great
measure
for
their
maintenance
on
the
wallaby
they
killed
the
skin
also
of
these
animals
constitutes
to
them
an
important
article
of
trade
it
was
the
before
we
had
completed
for
the
present
our
survey
of
this
part
owing
as
i
have
before
observed
to
the
constant
bad
weather
which
was
doubly
felt
by
the
boats
in
which
all
the
materials
for
the
chart
of
this
neighbourhood
were
collected
circular
head
we
now
examined
the
coast
to
circular
head
under
the
north
side
of
which
we
anchored
in
fathoms
on
the
morning
of
the
after
spending
a
day
under
the
corner
off
robbins
island
where
we
found
good
anchorage
in
westerly
winds
making
too
free
with
the
shore
with
a
low
sun
ahead
we
grounded
for
a
short
time
on
a
shingle
spit
extending
off
the
low
point
from
circular
head
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
this
point
is
a
dangerous
rocky
ledge
just
awash
on
which
several
vessels
have
run
by
keeping
the
bluff
extreme
of
circular
head
open
it
may
always
be
avoided
the
latter
is
a
singular
cliffy
mass
of
trappean
rock
rising
abruptly
from
the
water
till
its
flattened
crest
reaches
an
elevation
of
feet
this
strange
projection
stands
on
the
eastern
side
of
a
small
peninsula
on
the
parts
broken
off
where
it
joins
the
sandy
bay
on
the
north
side
we
found
the
compass
perfectly
useless
from
the
increased
quantity
of
magnetic
iron
ore
they
contain
it
is
on
this
point
that
the
headquarters
of
the
van
diemen
land
agricultural
company
are
established
under
the
charge
of
a
curr
whose
house
with
its
extensive
and
park
occupying
some
rising
ground
on
the
northern
part
of
the
point
greets
the
eye
of
the
stranger
to
whom
the
reflection
is
forcibly
suggested
by
the
sight
that
the
natural
graces
of
the
scene
must
soon
yield
to
the
restraining
regularity
with
which
man
marks
his
conquests
from
the
wilderness
the
name
of
this
faint
memento
of
home
was
we
were
informed
hyfield
a
straggling
village
occupies
a
flat
to
the
left
and
in
the
bay
on
the
south
side
of
the
head
which
is
the
general
anchorage
is
a
store
with
a
substantial
jetty
english
grasses
have
been
sown
at
this
establishment
with
great
success
one
acre
of
ground
now
feeding
four
sheep
instead
of
as
before
four
acres
being
required
for
one
the
improvement
in
the
grass
was
also
made
evident
by
the
excellent
condition
in
which
all
the
stock
appeared
to
be
hyfield
the
garden
at
hyfield
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
other
parts
of
the
establishment
and
it
was
not
a
little
pleasing
to
observe
a
number
of
english
fruit
trees
i
was
told
however
that
they
suffered
exceedingly
from
blight
which
was
brought
by
the
west
winds
in
one
corner
that
at
first
escaped
my
curiosity
so
completely
had
it
been
shut
out
from
the
gaze
of
all
by
a
winding
bowery
walk
i
found
in
a
sort
of
alcove
the
tomb
of
a
child
upon
it
lay
a
fresh
bouquet
of
flowers
revealing
that
the
dead
was
not
forgotten
by
those
who
were
left
behind
it
was
easy
to
divine
and
i
afterwards
learned
this
to
be
the
case
that
it
was
the
mother
curr
who
came
every
morning
to
pay
this
tribute
of
affection
to
the
departed
a
weeping
willow
drooped
its
supple
branches
over
the
tomb
some
and
surrounded
it
loading
the
air
with
their
rich
fragrance
not
even
the
chirping
of
a
bird
disturbed
the
solemn
silence
that
reigned
around
everything
seemed
to
conspire
to
suggest
holy
and
melancholy
thoughts
and
i
lingered
awhile
to
indulge
in
them
but
perceiving
by
the
few
footmarks
that
i
was
an
intruder
hastened
to
retire
by
no
means
sorry
however
to
have
discovered
this
evidence
of
the
enduring
love
a
mother
bears
her
offspring
in
the
park
at
hyfield
were
some
fallow
deer
imported
from
england
and
seeming
to
thrive
exceedingly
well
there
were
also
two
emus
the
sight
of
which
reminded
me
of
a
very
curious
observation
i
had
before
made
and
the
truth
of
which
again
struck
me
forcibly
namely
that
the
face
of
the
emu
bears
a
most
remarkable
likeness
to
that
of
the
aborigines
of
new
south
wales
had
there
been
any
intimacy
between
the
native
and
the
emu
i
might
have
been
disposed
to
resort
to
this
circumstance
as
an
explanation
for
some
maintain
that
the
human
countenance
partakes
of
the
expression
and
even
of
the
form
of
whatever
whether
man
or
beast
it
is
in
the
habit
of
associating
with
surrey
hills
the
company
have
another
station
about
sixty
miles
from
circular
head
at
the
surrey
hills
from
whence
the
road
to
launceston
is
good
and
wide
but
between
it
and
circular
head
there
are
several
rivers
to
ford
and
the
country
is
not
only
very
hilly
but
densely
wooded
with
enormous
trees
some
of
which
i
was
informed
were
feet
in
circumference
this
causes
great
difficulty
in
clearing
the
land
they
accomplish
about
fifty
acres
every
year
the
establishment
consists
of
one
hundred
persons
many
of
whom
are
convicts
they
are
kept
in
excellent
order
and
their
being
strictly
forbidden
the
use
of
spirits
no
doubt
contributes
materially
to
prevent
their
giving
trouble
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
company
conducted
its
operations
on
too
extensive
a
scale
to
render
their
undertaking
profitable
the
high
pay
of
their
officers
and
the
difficulties
encountered
in
clearing
the
land
are
in
themselves
considerable
drawbacks
especially
when
we
consider
that
after
all
the
pains
bestowed
the
soil
acquired
for
the
purposes
of
cultivation
is
often
of
very
inferior
quality
the
soil
on
the
peninsula
of
which
circular
head
forms
the
most
remarkable
feature
is
generally
speaking
of
a
poor
light
character
and
not
well
watered
the
country
lying
immediately
behind
it
is
low
and
cut
up
with
branches
from
a
large
estuary
my
esteemed
friend
count
strzelecki
traversed
the
country
between
circular
head
and
point
woolnorth
extreme
of
tasmania
and
describes
it
as
presenting
eight
rivers
as
difficult
to
cross
as
the
scamander
with
deep
gullies
and
rocky
ridges
and
marshes
more
difficult
to
overcome
than
either
ridges
or
rivers
mineral
waters
we
learned
there
were
some
mineral
waters
about
fifteen
miles
to
the
westward
of
circular
head
the
ingredients
they
contain
and
their
medicinal
properties
were
discovered
by
count
strzelecki
who
in
speaking
of
them
says
i
have
endeavoured
to
ascertain
both
the
latter
on
my
own
constitution
and
the
former
by
chemical
analysis
they
belong
to
a
class
of
carbonated
waters
from
his
examination
he
concludes
that
they
are
aperient
and
tonic
and
sufficiently
disgusting
to
the
palate
to
pass
for
highly
medicinal
whilst
here
i
was
informed
that
a
small
party
of
natives
were
still
at
large
though
seldom
seen
keeping
in
the
remotest
recesses
of
the
woods
they
thus
succeeded
in
avoiding
for
some
years
their
enemy
the
white
man
indeed
it
was
only
when
pressed
by
hunger
that
these
aboriginal
possessors
of
the
soil
ventured
to
emerge
from
their
and
rob
some
of
the
company
of
flour
by
these
means
however
it
was
that
a
knowledge
was
obtained
of
their
existence
for
though
they
managed
so
secretly
that
it
was
some
time
before
they
were
found
out
a
shepherd
at
an
began
at
last
frequently
to
miss
flour
and
in
a
very
mysterious
manner
he
determined
accordingly
to
watch
but
was
for
a
long
time
unsuccessful
at
length
he
saw
a
native
woman
steal
into
the
hut
when
he
drew
the
door
to
by
a
line
which
communicated
with
his
place
of
concealment
of
the
treatment
this
poor
woman
received
from
the
hands
of
her
captor
i
shall
treat
hereafter
after
being
kept
a
prisoner
some
time
she
was
sent
to
flinders
island
but
it
was
long
before
the
discovery
was
made
that
she
had
any
companions
i
was
informed
that
the
shepherd
who
took
her
afterwards
lost
his
life
by
the
spear
of
a
native
probably
impelled
by
revenge

fondness
exhibited
by
the
aborigines
who
inhabit
the
southern
parts
of
australia
for

extraordinary
sail
for
the
river
tamar
we
completed
our
operations
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
we
arrived
namely
december
and
left
for
the
tamar
river
in
order
to
measure
a
meridian
distance
passing
six
miles
from
rocky
cape
we
had
fathoms
and
steering
east
the
depth
gradually
increased
to
fathoms
with
a
soft
muddy
bottom
being
then
twenty
miles
by
west
from
port
dalrymple
the
mouth
of
the
tamar
the
was
one
of
the
few
fine
days
it
was
our
good
fortune
to
meet
with
and
we
enjoyed
a
splendid
view
of
the
alpine
features
of

towering
peaks
connected
sometimes
by
high
tablelands

in
the
sun
as
if
capped
with
snow
near

in

i
saw
snow
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
port
dalrymple
early
in
the
afternoon
the
lighthouse
on
low
head
appeared
like
a
white
speck
resting
on
the
blue
horizon
and
by
evening
we
found
ourselves
at
anchor
just
within
the
reefs
fronting
the
west
entrance
point
of
port
dalrymple
the
first
appearance
of
the
tamar
river
is
not
very
inviting
to
the
seaman
a
rapid
stream
thrown
out
of
its
course
hemmed
in
by
numerous
reefs
and
passing
over
a
bottom
so
uneven
as
to
cause
a
change
in
the
soundings
from
to
and
then
fathoms
with
a
ripple
or
line
of
broken
water
across
the
mouth
renders
it
impossible
in
strong
winds
for
a
stranger
to
detect
the
channels
and
raises
so
much
sea
that
the
pilots
can
not
reach
the
vessels
that
arrive
off
the
mouth
as
the
beagle
passed
through
the
west
channel
the
shear
or
first
beacon
on
the
west
reefs
was
on
with
a
hill
some
distance
up
the
river
although
there
is
very
apparent
difficulty
in
navigating
the
tamar
still
the
first
glance
shows
it
to
be
a
stream
of
importance
its
valley
although
not
wide
may
be
traced
for
miles
abruptly
separating
the
ranges
of
hills
we
can
easily
imagine
therefore
the
joy
experienced
by
captain
flinders
on
first
discovering
it
in
and
thus
bestowing
a
solid
and
lasting
benefit
on
the
future
tasmanian
colonists
this
is
not
however
the
only
portion
of
australasia

inhabitants
are
indebted
for
the
riches
they
are
reaping
from
the

needless
to
give
here

little
information

we
found
was

the

he
was
lost
in

in
a
very
mysterious
manner
in
no
trace

when

from

it

very
difficult
to
be
made
out
the
following
anecdote
will
illustrate
the
difficulty
of
detecting
the
mouths
of
rivers
in
australia
soon
after
we
anchored
in
hobson
bay
a
small
schooner
passed
going
to
melbourne
several
of
the
officers
were
at
the
time
standing
on
the
poop
and
each
selected
a
spot
at
which
the
schooner
was
to
enter
the
river
and
although
as
i
have
before
stated
we
were
only
one
mile
and
a
half
from
it
none
of
us
was
right
a
single
tall
tree
about
a
mile
inland
rose
over
the
schooner
as
she
left
the
waters
of
hobson
bay
william
town
consisted
at
that
time
of
only
a
few

one
disadvantage
under
which
this
place
labours
is
badness
of
water
while
the
country
around
it
is
a
dead
level
with
clumps
of
very
open
woodland
the
formation
is
whinstone
but
the
soil
fertile

shows
an
absence

up

found
that
about
two
miles
from

the

divides
one
branch
continuing
in

northerly
direction
and
the
other
a
narrow
sluggish
stream

suddenly
off
to
the
eastward

melbourne
the
township
of
melbourne
on
its
north
bank
five
miles
from
the
mouth
we
found
a
very
bustling
place
nearly
two
thousand
persons
had
already
congregated
there
and
more
were
arriving
every
day
so
that
great
speculation
was
going
on
in
land
we
were
delighted
with
the
appearance
of
the
country
and
the
rich
quality
of
the
soil
this
was
the
most
fertile
district
we
had
seen
in
all
australia
and
i
believe
everyone
allows
that
such
is
the
case
its
reputation
indeed
was
at
one
time
so
great
that
it
became
the
point
of
attraction
for
all
settlers
from
the
mother
country
where
at
one
time
the
rage
for
port
phillip
became
such
that
there
existed
scarcely
a
village
in
which
some
of
the
inhabitants
collecting
their
little
all
did
not
set
out
for
this
land
of
promise
with
the
hope
of
rapidly
making
a
fortune
and
returning
to
end
their
days
in
comfort
at
home
everyone
i
think
must
leave
with
such
hopes
for
who
can
deliberately
gather
up
his
goods
and
go
into
a
far
country
with
the
settled
intention
of
never
returning
a
rocky
ledge
extends
across
the
river
fronting
the
town
upon
which
the
plan
had
been
formed
of
erecting
a
dam
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
the
water
fresh
whereas
now
the
river
is
salt
above
the
town
and
the
well
water
is
not
particularly
good
the
is
not
navigable
even
for
boats
many
miles
beyond
melbourne
on
account
of
the
numerous
falls
some
of
the
reaches
above
the
town
are
very
picturesque
still
glassy
sheets
of
water
stretch
between
steep
banks
clothed
with
rich
vegetation
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the

the
branches
of
the
trees
droop
over
the
smooth
surface
and
are
vividly
reflected
and
substance
is
so
perfectly
blended
with
shadow
that
it
is
impossible
to
detect

and
about
thirty
above
the
town
there
are
now
none
of
the
aborigines
in
the
neighbourhood
of
melbourne
but
i
learned
that
some
of
their
old
men
remember
the
time
when
the
site
of
the
town
was
under
water
in
consequence
of
one
of
those
sudden
inundations
that
happen
in
australia
and
are
so
much
in
keeping
with
the
other
strange
things
that
occur
there
singular
custom
having
alluded
to
the
natives
i
may
here
mention
a
singular
custom
that
came
under
notice
some
time
after
at
the
protectorate
in
the
valley
of
the
loddon
in
the
vicinity
of
melbourne
several
women
were
observed
having
their
faces
completely
concealed
by
their
mantles
not
satisfied
with
this
moreover
in
passing
a
party
of
men
they
moved
in
a
sidelong
manner
so
as
to
render
it
impossible
even
if
the
covering
came
to
be
displaced
that
their
faces
should
be
seen
in
the
evening
at
the
corobbery
these
persons
three
in
number
were
seated
in
the
circle
of
women
so
as
to
have
their
backs
turned
to
the
dancers
or
actors
their
faces
still
being
wholly
concealed
they
remained
seated
motionless
taking
no
part
in
the
singing
or
the
gestures
of
encouragement
indulged
in
by
the
other
women
it
was
subsequently
explained
by
a
protector
that
these
were
women
who
had
daughters
betrothed
to
the
men
of
their
tribe
and
that
during
the
period
of
betrothment
the
mothers
are
always
thus
rigidly
veiled
near
mount
macedon
thirty
miles
from
melbourne
there
has
been
discovered
i
was
informed
a
quarry
of
marble
of
a
very
fine
quality
and
in
the
same
neighbourhood
is
an
extinct
crater
the
formation
at
and
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
melbourne
is
of
tertiary
deposits
associated
with
arenaceous
older
rocks
we
returned
to
the
ships
by
a
short
route
leading
direct
from
melbourne
to
the
northern
shore
of
hobson
bay
during
the
walk
i
was
much
struck
with
the
great
risk
that
people
run
in
selecting
land
from
a
map
of
this
country
half
of
our
road
lying
over
a
rich
loam
and
the
other
half
over
soft
sand
the
trees
swarmed
with
large
locusts
the
cicada
quite
deafening
us
with
their
shrill
buzzing
noise
manna
we
found
the
branches
of
these
trees
and
the
ground
underneath
strewed
over
with
a
white
substance
resembling
small
flakes
of
snow
called
by
the
colonists
manna
i
am
aware
that
an
erroneous
idea
exists
that
this
matter
is
deposited
by
the
locusts
but
in
fact
it
is
an
exudation
from
the
eucalyptus
and
although
i
saw
it
beneath
another
kind
of
tree
it
must
have
been
carried
there
by
the
wind
a
different
sort
of
a
pale
yellow
colour
is
found
on
a
smaller
species
of
eucalyptus
growing
on
highlands
and
is
much
sought
after
for
food
by
the
natives
who
sometimes
scrape
from
the
tree
as
much
as
a
pound
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
has
the
taste
of
a
delicious
sweetmeat
with
an
almond
flavour
and
is
so
luscious
that
much
can
not
be
eaten
of
it
this
is
well
worthy
of
attention
from
our
confectioners
at
home
and
it
may
hereafter
form
an
article
of
commerce
although
from
what
has
fallen
under
my
own
observation
and
from
what
i
have
learnt
from
eyre
and
others
i
should
say
it
is
not
of
frequent
occurrence
the
first
kind
being
found
strewed
underneath
the
tree
probably
exudes
from
the
leaf
whilst
the
second
oozes
from
the
stem
the
wood
of
the
latter
is
much
used
for
fuel
by
the
natives
especially
in
and
burns
brightly
without
smoke
diffusing
also
a
delicious
aromatic
smell
hobson
bay
on
christmas
day
which
we
spent
in
hobson
bay
we
experienced
one
of
those
hot
winds
which
occasionally
occur
coming
off
the
land
during
its
prevalence
everything
assumes
a
strange
appearance
objects
are
seen
with
difficulty
and
acquire
a
tremulous
motion
like
that
which
is
imparted
to
everything
seen
through
the
air
escaping
from
an
stove
the
thermometer
on
a
wall
under
the
glare
of
the
sun
stood
at
degrees
we
surveyed
hobson
bay
during
our
stay
and
connected
it
by
triangulation
with
melbourne
our
observations
were
made
at
the
inner
end
of
a
small
jetty
the
mouth
of
the
is
closed
up
by
a
bar
which
from
its
soft
muddy
nature
may
be
easily
removed
the
deepest
water
we
found
on
it
at
high
tide
was
nine
feet
corio
harbour
having
completed
our
operations
we
next
morning
january
departed
for
corio
harbour
situated
at
the
head
of
a
deep
inlet
midway
on
the
western
shore
of
port
phillip
we
found
our
progress
impeded
as
we
beat
up
it
by
a
long
spit
extending
two
thirds
of
the
way
across
from
a
low
projecting
point
lying
midway
on
the
north
shore
on
the
opposite
side
the
land
is
of
moderate
elevation
and
has
in
many
places
a
most
inviting
rich
appearance
swelling
on
all
sides
into
grassy
downs
with
patches
of
open
woodland
interspersed
in
the
afternoon
we
anchored
in
three
fathoms
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
south
point
of
corio
harbour
this
is
a
level
expanse
of
land
named
point
henry
from
which
a
long
spit
extends
leaving
only
a
shoal
channel
between
it
and
the
northern
shore
thus
though
the
harbour
has
apparently
a
broad
open
mouth
it
is
impossible
for
a
large
vessel
to
enter
it
january
after
breakfast
a
party
of
us
went
to
visit
captain
fyans
the
police
magistrate
of
the
district
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
a
trip
to
station
peak
we
landed
on
the
corner
of
corio
harbour
where
we
found
four
fathoms
close
to
the
beach
immediately
over
which
is
the
north
end
of
the
township
of
geelong
a
kind
of
store
and
two
other
wooden
buildings
pointed
out
its
locality
captain
fyans
was
living
in
a
on
the
banks
of
the
marabul
river
our
road
thither
lay
west
about
three
miles
across
a
woody
down
river
barwon
the
marabul
runs
to
the
southward
and
joins
the
barwon
flowing
from
the
west
after
which
the
united
streams
take
a
direction
the
course
of
the
latter
i
was
anxious
to
trace
having
seen
its
mouth
in
passing
along
the
coast
west
from
port
phillip
very
opportunely
i
met
with
smith
belonging
to
the
colonial
surveying
department
who
being
employed
in
the
neighbourhood
took
me
to
a
commanding
station
on
some
low
hills
about
three
miles
to
the
south
called
by
the
natives
barabul
we
crossed
the
barwon
running
to
the
at
the
foot
of
them
near
where
it
fell
some
height
over
a
rocky
shelf
forming
a
pretty
waterfall
turning
to
the
left
from
this
roar
of
water
you
find
the
stream
meandering
silently
between
rich
grassy
flats
on
one
of
these
smith
tents
were
pitched
overlooked
by
a
craggy
height
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
and
the
blue
stream
of
smoke
that
arose
from
the
fire
of
his
party
helped
to
impart
life
and
beauty
to
the
scene
from
the
barabul
hills
i
almost
traced
the
barwon
to
its
confluence
with
the
sea
five
miles
to
the
from
where
we
stood
it
communicated
with
a
large
lagoon
after
leaving
which
i
was
informed
there
was
only
a
depth
of
three
feet
and
a
width
of
one
eighth
of
a
mile
it
is
not
however
this
alone
that
renders
the
barwon
useless
for
to
the
town
of
geelong
for
the
exposed
situation
of
its
mouth
almost
always
prevents
boats
from
entering
the
singular
sloping
treeless
sides
of
the
barabul
hills
and
the
declivities
of
the
valley
of
the
marabul
river
bear
a
striking
resemblance
to
many
parts
of
eastern
patagonia
they
appear
as
if
they
had
just
emerged
from
the
sea
which
had
as
it
were
scooped
out
their
hollows
and
smoothed
their
sides
a
remarkable
high
round
hill
perfectly
bare
of
trees
and
called
by
the
natives
moriac
bore
west
south
six
miles
from
where
we
stood
on
our
return
we
met
some
of
the
natives
they
were
the
first
i
had
seen
of
the
aborigines
of
this
part
of
the
continent
and
were
certainly
a
finer
race
than
the
people
on
the
western
coasts
they
complained
of
the
white
men
bringing
animals
into
their
country
that
scare
away
the
kangaroo
and
destroy
the
roots
which
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
form
part
of
their
sustenance
this
smith
told
me
was
a
very
general
complaint
i
spent
a
very
pleasant
evening
at
captain
fyans
comfortable
quarters
in
the
course
of
which
arrangements
were
made
for
next
day
journey
to
station
peak
smith
kindly
offering
to
lend
me
a
horse
and
to
accompany
me
station
peak
january
we
started
for
station
peak
very
early
the
morning
air
had
a
delightfully
bracing
effect
and
the
grass
glittered
with
a
copious
fall
of
dew
the
first
five
miles
of
road
lay
over
a
high
down
with
pretty
patches
of
woodland
interspersed
and
the
remaining
ten
over
a
low
plain
that
stretches
to
the
foot
of
the
peak
six
miles
from
the
latter
we
crossed
a
hollow
where
i
noticed
some
calcareous
matter
in
which
were
included
shells
of
recent
species
evidently
showing
that
an
upheaval
had
taken
place
in
this
part
of
the
continent
we
saw
on
the
plain
several
large
bustards
resembling
a
light
brown
domestic
turkey
leaving
our
horses
at
the
foot
of
the
peak
we
ascended
it
by
a
sloping
ridge
on
the
face
huge
blocks
of
granite
some
poised
on
a
point
as
if
the
slightest
touch
would
send
them
rolling
and
thundering
to
the
plains
below
covered
the
sides
and
summits
of
this
and
the
smaller
peak
to
the
north
of
which
are
several
others
scattered
over
about
a
mile
of
ground
on
reaching
the
summit
i
hastened
to
a
pile
of
stones
which
captain
flinders
had
erected
to
commemorate
his
visit
but
alas
the
bottle
and
paper
left
by
him
were
gone
and
i
have
not
since
been
able
to
learn
who
it
was
that
took
away
this
interesting
and
valuable
record
view
from
station
peak
the
view
commanded
all
points
of
the
splendid
sheet
of
water
called
port
phillip
which
stretched
away
its
shining
expanse
seemingly
almost
from
our
very
feet
whilst
two
long
wavy
lines
of
trees
showed
the
course
of
the
little
and
weariby
rivers
meandering
through
the
plain
the
natives
call
this
cluster
of
peaks
ude
great
youang
and
the
other
seven
miles
anuke
little
youang
another
solitary
high
round
hill
fifteen
miles
further
nearly
in
the
same
direction
is
called
bununyong
we
have
thus
five
native
names
of
places
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
port
phillip
having
the
termination
ng
and
we
may
perhaps
add
another
the
barwon
being
probably
barwong
at
king
george
sound
in
western
australia
the
names
end
in
up
and
again
to
the
eastward
near
gipps
land
the
final
letter
is
these
observations
may
probably
assist
in
directing
the
attention
of
philologists
to
the
subject
of
the
distribution
of
the
australian
dialects
or
languages
ude
youang
or
as
captain
flinders
named
it
station
peak
is
a
granite
mass
elevated
feet
above
the
sea
at
geelong
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
formation
the
rocks
however
that
prevail
are
trappean
fossil
shells
in
digging
a
well
there
a
fossil
cowrie
cypraea

of
an
extinct
species
was
once
found
at
the
depth
of
sixty
feet
another
specimen
of

was
dug
up
at
franklin
village
near
launceston
from
a
hundred
and
forty
feet
below
the
surface
of

soil
count
strzelecki
gives
a
figure
of
it
in
his
interesting
work
ronald
gunn
in
his
observations
on
the
flora
of
geelong
observes
that
out
of
a
hundred
species
of
plants
collected
indiscriminately
were
also
to
be
found
in
tasmania
leaving
only
to
indicate
the
peculiarities
of
the
geelong
vegetation
some
of
the
officers
of
the
beagle
exhibited
at
this
place
symptoms
of
being
infected
with
the
mania
we
had
witnessed
at
melbourne
by
bidding
for
some
of
the
allotments
of
the
township
of
geelong
which
were
just
then
selling
one
that
was
bought
for
pounds
might
have
been
sold
a
year
afterwards
for
pounds
i
mention
this
fact
that
the
reader
may
see
what
a
ruinous
system
was
then
in
vogue
arthur
seat
on
the
morning
of
january
we
left
geelong
touched
at
hobson
bay
for
a
chronometric
departure
and
proceeded
to
sea
by
the
south
channel
arthur
seat
is
a
good
guide
for
its
entrance
from
hobson
bay
the
channel
passing
close
under
the
foot
of
it
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
northern
banks
we
found
very
difficult
to
make
out
from
the
water
being
but
slightly
discoloured
on
it
it
is
moreover
on
account
of
its
steepness
dangerous
to
approach
from
this
eastern
corner
of
the
bank
arthur
seat
bears
south
degrees
west
and
a
solitary
patch
of
cliff
westward
of
the
latter
south
degrees
east
in
consequence
of
bad
weather
it
was
three
days
before
we
passed
through
the
channel
which
we
were
pleased
to
find
navigable
for
line
of
battle
ships
a
west
north
course
led
through
and
the
least
water
was
five
fathoms
on
a
bar
at
the
eastern
entrance
where
the
width
is
only
of
a
mile
whilst
in
the
western
it
is
one
mile
with
a
depth
of
seventeen
fathoms
when
in
the
latter
we
saw
flinders
point
between
lonsdale
and
nepean
points
and
as
we
came
down
the
channel
the
last
two
points
were
just
open
of
each
other
port
western
leaving
port
phillip
we
surveyed
the
coast
to
the
eastward
and
anchored
in
the
entrance
of
port
western
after
dark
on
the
next
morning
we
examined
the
part
of
grant
island
and
moved
the
ship
to
a
more
secure
anchorage
off
its
point
port
western
is
formed
between
grant
and
french
islands
in
rather
a
remarkable
manner
two
great
bays
lie
one
within
the
other
the
inner
being
nearly
filled
up
by
french
island
whilst
the
outer
is
sheltered
by
grant
island
stretching
across
it
almost
from
point
to
point
and
leaving
a
wide
on
its
western
side
whilst
on
the
eastern
the
passage
is
narrow
and
fit
only
for
boats
and
small
vessels
gales
between
and
detained
us
here
until
the
we
found
water
by
digging
on
the
extreme
of
grant
island
which
at
high
tide
is
a
low
sandy
islet
on
first
landing
there
we
found
in
a
clump
of
bushes
a
kangaroo
very
indeed
almost
black
his
retreat
being
cut
off
he
took
to
the
water
and
before
a
boat
could
reach
him
sank
this
not
only
disappointed
but
surprised
us
for
in
tasmania
a
kangaroo
has
been
known
to
swim
nearly
two
miles
black
swans
were
very
numerous
and
it
being
the
moulting
season
were
easily
run
down
by
the
boats
their
outstretched
necks
and
the
quick
flap
of
their
wings
as
they
moved
along
reminded
us
forcibly
of
a
steamboat
at
this
season
of
the
year
when
the
swans
can
not
fly
a
great
act
of
cruelty
is
practised
on
them
by
those
who
reside
on
the
islands
in
bass
strait
and
of
whom
i
have
before
spoken
as
sealers
they
take
them
in
large
numbers
and
place
them
in
confinement
without
anything
to
eat
in
fact
almost
starve
them
to
death
in
order
that
the
down
may
not
be
injured
by
the
fat
which
generally
covers
their
bodies
scarcely
any
traces
are
now
to
be
found
of
the
old
settlement
on
a
cliffy
point
of
the
eastern
shore
of
the
harbour
the
rapid
growth
of
indigenous
vegetation
has
completely
concealed
all
signs
of
human
industry
and
the
few
settlers
in
the
neighbourhood
have
helped
themselves
to
the
bricks
to
build
their
own
homes
we
noticed
however
one
or
two
remaining
indications
of
the
fact
that
a
settlement
had
formerly
existed
on
that
spot
among
others
an
old
flagstaff
still
erect
on
a
bluff
near
the
end
of
grant
island
a
very
large
domestic
cat
also
was
seen
on
the
point
doubtless
another
relic
of
the
first
settlers
the
rocks
chiefly
to
be
met
with
at
port
western
are
analogous
to
those
of
the
carboniferous
series
over
its
eastern
shore
rises
a
range
of
woody
hills
to
the
height
of
between
five
and
seven
hundred
feet
stretching
away
in
a
direction
this
harbour
presents
one
very
curious
feature
namely
a
sort
of
canal
or
gut
in
the
mud
flats
that
front
the
eastern
side
of
grant
island
its
depth
varies
from
six
to
seven
fathoms
whilst
the
width
is
half
a
mile
the
most
remarkable
object
however
is
the
headland
rising
abruptly
from
the
sea
to
the
height
of
feet
and
forming
the
extreme
of
grant
island
it
is
the
more
conspicuous
from
the
circumstance
that
all
the
rest
of
the
island
is
covered
with
low
hills
clothed
in
an
almost
impervious
scrub
the
land
at
the
head
of
the
inner
of
the
two
bays
i
have
alluded
to
in
describing
port
western
partakes
of
the
same
character
and
is
intersected
by
a
number
of
creeks
this
greatly
increases
the
difficulty
of
the
overland
communication
between
port
phillip
and
the
available
land
on
port
western
travellers
being
compelled
to
take
a
very
circuitous
road
in
order
to
avoid
this
almost
impassable
tract
and
reach
the
banks
of
bass
river
where
the
best
soil
is
found
and
which
has
been
named
after
the
enterprising
man
whose
memory
must
for
ever
remain
intimately
connected
with
this
part
of
the
world
snake
adventure
a
few
rare
insects
were
collected
by
emery
whose
adventures
with
snakes
bear
a
great
resemblance
to
some
of
waterton
he
was
walking
out
once
on
grant
island
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
pitiful
cries
of
a
bird
in
a
tree
close
at
hand
he
soon
discovered
that
a
was
in
the
act
of
robbing
the
nest
whilst
the
mother
fluttering
round
was
endeavouring
to
scare
away
the
spoiler
emery
immediately
climbed
up
and
with
a
courage
which
few
other
men
would
have
exhibited
seized
the
reptile
by
the
back
of
the
neck
and
killed
it
we
found
that
it
had
already
swallowed
one
of
the
young
ones
which
had
so
extended
the
skin
and
made
so
large
a
lump
that
we
were
quite
puzzled
to
know
how
it
could
have
been
got
down
lieutenant
emery
has
this
snake
still
in
his
possession
stuffed
in
a
masterly
style
and
set
up
with
the
bird
in
its
mouth
capabilities
of
port
western
we
were
astonished
to
find
the
tide
here
nearly
an
hour
later
than
at
port
phillip
and
higher
by
six
feet
the
cause
of
this
peculiarity
is
no
doubt
to
be
attributed
to
the
fact
of
the
tides
at
port
western
being
influenced
by
the
easterly
the
bad
weather
we
experienced
during
our
stay
enabled
us
to
judge
of
the
capabilities
of
the
port
which
we
were
glad
to
find
the
finest
we
had
yet
seen
in
bass
strait
not
so
much
however
from
its
size
for
above
grant
island
the
extent
of
deep
water
is
limited
as
from
the
great
facility
of
access
on
the
we
left
port
western
passing
out
by
keeping
an
isolated
piece
of
tableland
called
tortoise
head
on
the
extremity
of
french
island
open
of
the
point
of
grant
island
the
only
danger
is
a
sandbank
lying
in
the
centre
of
the
channel
four
miles
within
the
entrance
it
may
always
be
avoided
by
keeping
a
cable
length
from
the
eastern
shore
the
western
half
of
the
south
side
of
grant
island
is
a
line
of
cliffs
from
one
to
three
hundred
feet
in
height
a
remarkable
pyramidal
rock
marks
the
point
where
this
terminates
after
which
a
long
range
of
low
hills
covered
with
scrub
stretches
to
cape
wollami
the
headland
a
light
wind
rendered
our
progress
slow
towards
cape
patterson
we
reaching
it
by
daylight
of
the
it
is
a
low
point
covered
with
scattered
sand
hillocks
a
few
rocky
patches
here
and
there
front
its
sand
beach
finding
from
the
succession
of
dense
fogs
that
we
could
not
prosecute
an
easterly
examination
of
the
coast
we
returned
towards
port
phillip
and
experienced
some
unusual
swells
off
port
western
extraordinary
soundings
the
soundings
were
in
general
tolerably
regular
but
in
the
same
neighbourhood
we
had
some
extraordinary
ones
seventy
fathoms
on
a
gravelly
bottom
this
was
nearly
one
third
of
the
way
across
from
grant
island
to
cape
shanck
seven
miles
from
the
latter
the
same
strange
depth
was
likewise
found
three
miles
south
from
cape
wollami
with
the
same
kind
of
gravel
bottom
or
a
very
fine
kind
of
shingle
it
was
a
single
cast
of
the
lead
on
either
side
in
this
last
case
were
and
fathoms
fine
sand
and
shells
had
it
not
been
for
the
change
in
the
quality
of
the
bottom
i
should
have
doubted
so
great
a
depth
which
is
the
more
remarkable
from
its
being
the
greatest
within
the
strait
the
next
day
towards
evening
we
again
anchored
in
hobson
bay
where
we
stayed
till
the
this
time
in
getting
out
of
port
phillip
through
the
southern
channel
we
met
with
an
accident
i
have
before
mentioned
the
difficulty
of
seeing
the
eastern
part
of
the
north
bank
which
on
this
occasion
combined
with
the
dazzling
effect
of
the
sun
rays
ahead
was
the
cause
of
our
grounding
for
a
short
time
near
the
inner
entrance
it
was
therefore
noon
next
day
before
we
were
again
outside
when
we
steered
across
for
the
north
end
of
king
island
january
in
passing
franklin
road
the
next
morning
we
saw
a
cutter
at
anchor
doubtless
the
colonial
vessel
which
is
occasionally
allowed
to
visit
captain
smith
and
afford
him
supplies
we
passed
down
four
miles
from
the
western
side
of
king
island
carrying
an
outer
line
of
soundings
varying
from
to
fathoms
and
in
the
evening
anchored
in
fitzmaurice
bay
bell
rock
next
morning
we
proceeded
in
search
of
bell
rock
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
south
entrance
of
bass
strait
eight
miles
south
from
the
northern
and
largest
of
reid
rocks
but
there
being
only
a
light
air
stirring
from
the
westward
we
were
almost
wholly
at
the
mercy
of
the
tide
which
carried
us
midway
between
its
assigned
position
and
the
dangers
we
passed
near
several
small
eddies
and
slight
whirlpools
in
which
no
bottom
was
found
in
the
boats
with
fathoms
the
extremity
of
reid
rock
might
with
propriety
be
described
as
a
small
islet
it
being
a
dark
mass
some
half
a
mile
long
and
rising
feet
out
of
the
water
the
french
charts
exhibit
some
sunken
rocks
to
the
north
of
this
but
if
they
really
exist
of
which
there
is
great
doubt
we
saw
nothing
of
them
i
may
here
mention
that
great
circumspection
should
be
used
by
vessels
in
the
neighbourhood
of
reid
rocks
as
the
soundings
do
not
indicate
their
approach
and
as
the
tide
runs
among
them
with
great
rapidity
a
rock
was
seen
in
conway
five
miles
from
bell
rock
black
pyramid
between
them
and
the
black
pyramid
we
had
and
fathoms
we
passed
the
night
standing
to
and
fro
close
to
the
pyramid
which
i
have
before
described
as
a
dark
rocky
lump
feet
high
its
western
side
is
a
sombre
cliff
whilst
to
the
east
it
slopes
away
almost
to
the
water
edge
a
few
patches
of
coarse
grass
may
be
seen
on
some
sheltered
spots
sealers
i
am
informed
have
landed
upon
it
on
certain
rare
occasions
of
fine
weather
and
have
been
repaid
for
their
daring
by
capturing
a
few
from
the
rookery
that
there
exists
the
black
pyramid
from
some
points
of
view
greatly
resembles
curtis
island
near
the
eastern
entrance
of
the
strait
a
mile
and
a
half
from
its
eastern
side
there
was
only
fathoms
which
was
the
least
water
we
were
in
during
the
night
january
we
found
ourselves
at
daylight
in
fathoms
two
miles
from
the
pyramid
when
we
stood
away
to
sound
and
have
a
seaward
view
of
the
entrance
between
hunter
island
and
point
woolnorth
this
examination
confirmed
our
former
opinion
that
no
existed
there
but
even
if
there
had
been
one
the
passage
is
so
strewed
with
rocks
and
disturbed
by
such
heavy
tide
ripples
that
it
wears
a
most
dangerous
appearance
from
the
offing
rounding
the
south
side
of
the
south
black
rock
we
went
between
it
and
steep
island
in
fathoms
from
thence
we
steered
between
the
north
black
rock
and
the
west
point
of
hunter
island
in
fathoms
having
fathoms
midway
between
albatross
island
continuing
our
northern
course
we
passed
a
mile
from
the
west
side
of
albatross
island
in
and
fathoms
it
is
a
dark
cliffy
isle
the
summit
of
which
although
feet
high
appears
to
be
sometimes
washed
by
the
sea
there
are
one
or
two
points
of
rock
at
the
south
end
and
a
singular
split
in
the
entire
island
may
be
seen
on
the
bearing
of
north
degrees
east
the
wind
had
now
increased
to
a
gale
from
the
westward
and
we
were
obliged
to
seek
shelter
under
hunter
island
january
in
the
morning
the
breeze
was
moderate
from
to
which
quarter
it
had
changed
suddenly
during
the
night
veering
round
from
west
by
the
north
by
noon
it
had
shifted
to
and
had
increased
to
a
gale
at
it
blew
a
strong
gale
with
gusts
from
that
quarter
the
barometer
had
now
just
begun
to
fall
and
was
at
during
the
day
it
had
been
steady
at
this
gale
lasted
blowing
with
the
same
violence
latterly
from
east
until
the
next
day
when
after
a
calm
of
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
wind
changed
suddenly
to
north
with
rain
thunder
and
vivid
lightning
and
by
had
veered
to
west
and
increased
once
more
to
a
strong
gale
with
heavy
squalls
the
barometer
at
the
same
time
began
to
rise
it
had
been
stationary
at
since
the
morning
it
was
the
evening
of
the
before
this
gale
blew
over
after
veering
to
the
the
barometer
at
the
time
was
at
having
risen
to
that
height
in
the
morning
the
rotatory
character
of
this
storm
which
resembled
those
we
had
experienced
on
our
former
visit
induces
me
to
enter
thus
into
details
respecting
it
these
observations
too
may
evince
more
plainly
the
necessity
of
an
anchorage
at
this
time
of
the
year
being
sheltered
from
both
east
and
west
winds
fire
on
three
hummock
island
the
fire
that
had
been
accidentally
kindled
on
three
hummock
island
when
we
were
last
there
was
still
burning
this
conflagration
had
almost
been
fatal
to
bynoe
who
was
out
in
the
scrubs
when
it
burst
forth
having
with
great
difficulty
forced
his
way
among
them
in
search
of
specimens
for
his
collection
of
birds
his
attention
was
suddenly
roused
by
the
roaring
of
the
flames
as
they
swept
down
the
sides
of
the
hills
wrapping
them
in
a
sheet
of
fire
the
predicament
in
which
he
was
placed
was
a
most
critical
one
as
he
hardly
knew
which
way
to
turn
to
avoid
the
pressing
danger
even
when
fortunately
he
had
taken
the
right
direction
it
was
with
the
greatest
exertion
that
he
burst
through
the
matted
thicket
and
reached
the
water
edge
before
the
fire
our
fishermen
were
very
successful
with
the
hook
and
line
taking
near
the
rocks
great
numbers
of
fish
some
of
which
were
a
species
of
rock
cod
alongside
the
ship
we
only
caught
sharks
one
of
which
contained
young
ones
although
the
barometer
remained
stationery
at
the
weather
continued
so
boisterous
and
westerly
squalls
followed
each
other
in
such
rapid
succession
that
it
was
the
of
february
before
we
could
commence
work
in
earnest
on
that
day
the
ship
was
moved
to
near
the
south
end
of
hunter
island
where
we
found
a
nice
quiet
anchorage
with
scarcely
any
tide
off
a
long
sandy
beach
leave
for
circular
head
by
the
we
completed
what
remained
to
be
done
of
the
survey
of
this
part
and
proceeded
to
collect
the
necessary
soundings
between
three
hummock
island
and
circular
head
anchoring
under
the
latter
the
same
evening
here
we
met
curr
the
company
superintendent
who
was
absent
during
our
first
visit
from
him
we
experienced
so
great
hospitality
that
our
stay
appeared
shorter
than
it
really
was
on
the
morning
of
the
we
again
left
it
was
our
intention
to
have
stood
over
midway
across
the
strait
in
search
of
some
islands
reported
by
the
french
to
be
thereabouts
though
all
the
local
information
we
could
gain
on
the
subject
tended
to
induce
a
disbelief
of
their
existence
heavy
gale
but
the
sky
assuming
a
threatening
aspect
and
the
wind
increasing
from
the
westward
we
sought
shelter
under
the
end
of
robbin
island
and
it
was
well
we
did
so
for
during
the
following
two
days
it
blew
the
heaviest
gale
we
had
yet
met
with
in
the
strait
a
succession
of
violent
gusts
from
the
west
with
loud
thunder
vivid
lightning
and
much
rain
constantly
reminded
us
of
the
wisdom
of
our
cautious
proceeding
at
port
phillip
this
same
storm
was
felt
very
severely
such
was
its
strength
and
violence
that
many
houses
were
unroofed
and
other
damage
done
to
a
large
amount
it
passed
over
both
melbourne
and
geelong
darkening
the
air
with
the
clouds
of
dust
it
bore
along
with
it
and
filling
the
minds
of
the
inhabitants
with
the
greatest
terror
and
apprehension
they
called
it
a
tornado
and
it
appeared
to
have
quite
the
rotatory
character
of
a
hurricane
february
we
left
this
anchorage
and
passed
three
miles
from
the
side
of
three
hummock
island
where
we
found
only
six
fathoms
apparently
on
a
bank
thrown
up
by
the
tide
sweeping
round
its
sides
from
thence
we
steered
across
the
strait
to
sea
elephant
rock
on
the
eastern
shore
of
king
island
we
saw
nothing
of
the
islands
laid
down
by
the
french
thirteen
leagues
east
of
it
and
it
was
my
firm
belief
that
they
had
no
existence
subsequent
observation
has
confirmed
this
belief
we
however
found
the
shoal
water
supposed
to
exist
thereabouts
the
northern
termination
of
the
highland
over
the
part
of
the
island
which
marks
sea
elephant
bay
was
very
apparent
as
we
approached
in
the
evening
we
anchored
in
seven
fathoms
on
the
north
side
of
sea
elephant
rock
which
we
visited
the
following
morning
it
is
nearly
a
mile
in
circumference
and
feet
high
clothed
with
a
coarse
wiry
grass
a
small
vessel
if
properly
moored
might
find
shelter
under
it
from
easterly
gales
we
were
surprised
to
find
the
time
of
here
nearly
two
hours
earlier
than
at
three
hummock
island
the
came
from
the
southward
wild
dogs
of
the
number
of
wild
dogs
that
we
had
heard
of
as
being
on
this
island
we
saw
only
two
from
the
bones
we
found
of
others
it
is
more
than
probable
that
they
live
upon
each
other
at
the
seasons
of
the
year
when
the
mutton
birds
having
departed
they
would
otherwise
have
to
depend
solely
for
subsistence
on
the
few
shellfish
adhering
to
the
rocks
this
reminded
me
of
what
i
once
witnessed
on
an
island
off
the
eastern
coast
of
patagonia
several
herds
of
deer
had
once
existed
upon
it
but
some
persons
having
turned
a
number
of
dogs
loose
the
original
inhabitants
were
soon
destroyed
and
the
newcomers
afterwards
devoured
each
other
so
that
when
i
saw
them
but
a
small
remnant
remained
the
dogs
on
sea
elephant
rock
which
were
left
by
sealers
had
grown
so
wild
that
they
would
not
allow
us
to
approach
them
i
saw
here
some
small
penguins
a
bird
we
rarely
met
with
in
the
strait
this
part
of
king
island
is
clothed
with
thick
scrubs
among
which
we
saw
numerous
tracks
of
kangaroos
a
certain
sign
that
it
is
not
much
frequented
by
civilized
or
uncivilized
man
leaving
this
anchorage
we
examined
the
eastern
shore
of
the
island
which
we
found
as
i
have
before
described
to
be
low
and
sandy
passing
along
two
miles
from
it
we
had
a
depth
of
from
to
and
fathoms
as
we
approached
the
northern
end
the
character
of
the
coast
changed
it
being
formed
by
rocky
points
with
small
sand
bays
intervening
the
reef
laid
down
by
the
french
two
miles
from
the
extremity
of
the
island
we
found
to
be
only
half
a
mile
from
it
one
of
the
many
errors
we
discovered
in
the
french
chart
of
the
strait
it
is
a
small
ugly
ledge
quite
beneath
the
water
and
from
the
absence
of
rocky
points
on
the
low
sandy
shore
it
fronts
is
quite
unlooked
for
navarin
and
harbinger
rocks
the
next
day
february
we
examined
the
dangers
fronting
the
north
side
of
the
island
consisting
of
navarin
and
harbinger
rocks
neither
of
which
we
found
so
formidable
or
so
far
from
the
shore
as
had
been
reported
the
former
lies
only
a
mile
and
a
half
off
the
north
end
and
although
we
did
not
pass
between
it
and
the
shore
there
is
little
doubt
that
a
passage
exists
we
passed
between
the
harbinger
rocks
in
fathoms
this
great
depth
in
their
immediate
vicinity
gives
no
warning
of
their
proximity
in
the
night
or
during
thick
weather
complete
the
survey
of
port
phillip
as
it
was
now
necessary
for
us
to
think
of
preparing
for
our
return
to
the
north
coast
the
proper
season
for
passing
through
torres
strait
also
approaching
and
the
increasing
importance
of
port
phillip
rendering
it
desirable
to
complete
our
survey
of
its
entrance
before
our
departure
we
consequently
proceeded
thither
we
found
even
soundings
of
fathoms
extend
twenty
miles
north
by
east
from
harbinger
reef
but
from
thence
northwards
the
depths
gradually
decreased
calms
and
light
winds
rendered
the
passage
across
very
tedious
we
spent
one
night
at
anchor
in
fathoms
near
the
entrance
about
six
miles
south
from
point
flinders
where
the
tide
scarcely
ran
a
knot
an
hour
the
set
with
these
operations
closed
our
work
in
bass
strait
for
the
present
we
had
completed
the
western
entrance
from
port
western
on
the
north
shore
and
circular
head
on
the
south
the
weather
had
prevented
our
doing
more
and
obtaining
as
many
soundings
as
we
could
have
wished
it
had
been
unusually
boisterous
and
unsettled
much
more
so
than
the
winter
generally
is
from
all
i
could
learn
such
a
season
had
not
been
experienced
in
the
memory
of
the
oldest
inhabitants
march
bidding
adieu
to
our
hospitable
friends
we
left
port
phillip
and
having
spent
a
night
at
port
western
stood
out
from
it
next
morning
and
passed
over
in
and
fathoms
the
patch
of
discoloured
water
discovered
by
flinders
two
miles
south
of
the
remarkable
round
islet
that
lies
off
the
western
extreme
of
grant
island
pursuing
our
course
to
the
eastward
we
were
detained
by
contrary
winds
for
some
time
among
the
islands
at
the
eastern
entrance
of
the
strait
all
these
we
found
to
be
considerably
out
in
position
showing
the
necessity
of
an
accurate
survey
we
were
exceedingly
delighted
when
on
the
we
were
enabled
fairly
to
turn
our
back
on
bass
strait
that
region
of
storms
which
stretched
behind
us
as
we
receded
like
a
black
mass
resting
on
the
horizon
a
strong
soon
carried
us
far
away
from
it
in
the
direction
we
had
been
so
long
endeavouring
to
pursue
at
noon
on
the
we
were

leaving

tract
of
country
between
them
and
the
sea
pigeon
house
to
the
of
this
bay
we
had
an
excellent
view
of
that
singular
landmark
which
captain
cook
with
his
usual
felicity
in
the
choice
of
names
called
the
pigeon
house
it
was
just
open
of
the
south
end
of
some
tablelands
and
resembled
a
cupola
superimposed
upon
a
large
dome
next
day
in
the
forenoon
we
again
arrived
at
sydney
where
we
remained
from
march
to
may
employing
the
time
in
completing
our
charts
sending
home
tracings
of
them
and
preparing
for
our
cruise
on
the
northern
coast
i
was
glad
to
find
the
return
meridian
distance
between
port
phillip
and
sydney
agree
with
the

drought
at
sydney
everything
was
still
suffering
from
one
of
those
fearful
droughts
that
occasionally
visit
this
colony
but
are
as
yet
unknown
in
western
australia
where
the
seasons
are
certain
although
available
land
is
scarce
an
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
nature
of
this
visitation
when
i
say
that
for
some
time
previous
to
our
former
departure
from
sydney
during
the
whole
of
our
absence
and
for
several
months
subsequent
to
our
return
not
a
drop
of
rain
fell
the
consequence
of
this
was
that
the
whole
country
was
dried
up
and
the
dust
lay
on
the
roads
especially
towards
parramatta
at
least
a
foot
thick
whoever
attempted
to
travel
therefore
seemed
if
the
wind
blew
as
though
he
had
been
passing
through
a
mill
it
will
readily
be
imagined
that
so
long
a
succession
of
dry
seasons
did
prodigious
injury
to
the
stock
and
utterly
ruined
the
wheat
crops
to
add
to
the
distress
then
occasioned
the
people
of
tasmania
seizing
on
the
opportunity
raised
the
price
of
grain
expecting
to
make
a
large
profit
but
their
avidity
in
this
instance
itself
instead
of
sending
to
them
for
corn
the
people
of
sydney
despatched
vessels
to
south
america
and
as
the
early
cargoes
that
arrived
sold
to
advantage
a
great
deal
of
money
was
embarked
in
the
speculation
soon
however
the
natural
consequence
ensued
the
market
became
glutted
cargo
after
cargo
came
in
the
purchasers
held
back
prices
fell
and
in
many
instances
the
importers
were
glad
to
dispose
of
their
wheat
at
a
rate
far
inferior
to
what
it
had
been
shipped
at
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
financial
derangement
caused
by
so
large
an
amount
of
bullion
going
out
of
the
country
for
all
these
cargoes
were
bought
with
ready
money
had
much
to
do
with
the
subsequent
depression
i
may
here
take
an
opportunity
of
remarking
that
as
a
general
rule
it
is
the
labouring
classes
that
thrive
best
at
sydney
they
can
in
tolerably
prosperous
times
earn
sufficient
in
three
or
four
days
to
support
themselves
throughout
the
week
during
the
remainder
of
the
time
the
sober
and
industrious
man
employs
himself
in
building
a
house
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
generality
repair
to
the
vast
number
of
public
houses
that
swarm
on
every
side
and
get
drunk
this
is
evident
from
the
annual
revenue
derived
from
rum
which
in
was
pounds
amounting
to
more
than
seven
gallons
for
every
individual
in
the
colony
usborne
leaves
it
caused
us
extreme
regret
that
before
our
departure
from
sydney
we
were
deprived
of
usborne
valuable
services
he
was
compelled
to
return
home
in
consequence
of
the
dreadful
wound
he
had
received
from
a
musket
ball
which
as
has
already
been
related
passed
through
his
body
in
him
the
expedition
sustained
a
great
loss
his
presence
and
society
were
missed
by
all
and
his
departure
was
generally
felt
it
may
easily
be
conceived
indeed
that
the
separation
from
a
friend
and
messmate
under
such
circumstances
must
have
cast
for
a
time
a
shade
of
sadness
over
our
minds
usborne
took
charge
of
the
charts
which
we
sent
to
england
on
this
occasion
cunningham
i
can
not
leave
sydney
without
alluding
to
our
meeting
with
cunningham
the
botanist
whose
death
i
have
already
mentioned
as
having
taken
place
two
months
after
our
departure
from
sydney
though
worn
out
by
disease
and
evidently
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
the
fire
of
enthusiasm
kindled
in
his
frame
and
his
eyes
glistened
as
he
talked
of
our
projected
enterprise
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
could
be
dissuaded
from
accompanying
us
his
name
which
will
be
remembered
by
his
friends
on
account
of
his
many
amiable
qualities
will
not
be
forgotten
by
posterity
for
it
has
become
associated
with
the
lands
he
explored
as
well
as
with
the
natural
productions
he
described
the
presence
and
attention
of
his
valued

we

bade

to
our

at

and
sailed
to
explore
the
part
of
the
continent
which
from
the
number
of
openings
still
unexamined
possessed
the
interest
that
invariably
attaches
to
whatever
is
unknown
we
submitted
accordingly
with
impatience
to
the
delay
caused
by
light
winds
and
a
southerly
current
of
nearly
a
knot
per
hour
which
prevented
us
from
reaching
the
parallel
of
port
macquarie
before
the
when
about
forty
miles
from
it
we
experienced
a
gale
from
and
that
lasted
till
the
evening
of
the
next
day
when
we
found
ourselves
about
miles
of
port
stephens
during
this
gale
the
southerly
current
increased
its
velocity
to
two
miles
an
hour
and
its
strength
appeared
to
be
about
seventy
miles
from
the
land
this
delay
rendered
it
necessary
to
obtain
a
fresh
chronometric
departure
and
as
the
winds
prevented
our
returning
to
port
jackson
we
proceeded
to
port
stephens
where
we
anchored
june
we
found
the
admiralty
chart
of
the
coast
in
the
neighbourhood
very
defective
some
islands
being
completely
omitted
whilst
others
were
much
misplaced
this
gale
was
from
at
sydney
and
the
most
severe
they
had
experienced
for
many
years
it
blew
many
vessels
adrift
and
did
other
damage
remarkable
headlands
port
stephens
i
have
before
spoken
of
the
change
in
the
features
of
this
portion
of
the
eastern
coast
here
a
number
of
conical
hills
from
four
to
six
hundred
feet
in
height
suddenly
presented
themselves
to
our
view
two
of
them
very
remarkable
headlands
and
preserving
the
aboriginal
names
of
yacaba
and
tomare
constitute

of

the
of
tomare
is
a
high
line
of
cliffs
from
which
projects
a
leaving
only
a
narrow
entrance
when
in
this
i
noticed
that
a
round
hill
at
the
south
end
of
a
distant
range
was
over
the
opening
between
the
first
island
and
the
northern
shore
of
the
harbour
within
the
entrance
are
extensive
sandbanks
leaving
between
them
and

narrow
and
in
some
parts
deep
channel
subject
to
a
rapid
stream

may
be
considered
a
large
estuary
about
fifteen
miles
in
length
contracted
near
the
centre
to
a
width
of
about
a
mile
which
is
further
lessened
by
the
presence
of
a
woody
islet
the
same
i
have
before
alluded
to
nearly
two
miles
within
this
narrow
the

off

of

on
the
side
of
a
hill
half
a
mile
to
the
westward
is
the
residence
of
the
superintendent
a
situation
which
to
enhance
the
pleasure
of
our
visit
was
held
by
captain
king
tahlee
the
name
of
this
spot
surpassed
in
beauty
all
i
have
ever
seen
in
australia
it
stands
on
the
crest
of
a
steep
grassy
slope
over
which
are
scattered
numerous
small
bushy
lemon
trees
the
deep
verdure
of
their
foliage
interspersed
with
golden
fruit
contrasting
charmingly
with
the
light
green
carpet
from
which
they
spring
at
the
foot
of
this
declivity
a
screen
of
trees
rising
to
a
considerable
height
almost
shuts
out
the
view
of
the
water
though
breaks
here
and
there
allow
small
patches
to
be
seen
athwart
which
a
native
canoe
occasionally
glides
to
and
from
the
fishing
grounds
these
fairy
boats
stealing
along
the
water
on
a
fine
calm
morning
greatly
enhance
the
beauty
of
the
scene
they
belong
to
a
party
of
natives
who
have
taken
up
their
quarters
near
tahlee
and
who
though
by
no
means
a
fine
race
have
always
been
well
disposed
towards
europeans
unfortunately
they
are
much
addicted
to
the
use
of
ardent
spirits
having
acquired
the
habit
from
the
whalers
who
frequent
the
place
a
young
woman
and
her
husband
form
part
of
the
domestic
establishment
at
tahlee
we
were
as
much
delighted
as
surprised
with
the
richness
of
the
vegetation
when
compared
with
its
dry
parched
appearance
at
sydney
another
of
the
striking
contrasts
characteristic
of
australia
at
captain
king
table
i
tasted
the
pigeon
it
is
the
largest
of
any
of
the
australian
kinds
and
the
flesh
is
very
white
and
rich
it
is
a
difficult
bird
to
shoot
as
it
always
keeps
in
the
thickest
foliage
and
is
strong
and
quick
on
the
wing
through
the
kindness
of
the
same
friend
i
was
also
enabled
to
enjoy
a
ride
into
the
country
during
the
interval
between
the
observations
for
rating
the
chronometers
river
karuah
i
had
to
ascend
the
karuah
river
flowing
into
the
corner
of
port
stephens
for
twelve
miles
to
a
place
called
boorral
the
furthest
point
at
which
it
is
navigable
and
where
all
goods
are
landed
for
the
company
stations
up
the
country
ebsworth
the
treasurer
of
the
company
resides
there
in
a
charming
cottage
almost
covered
with
roses
and
honeysuckle
and
commanding
two
picturesque
reaches
of
the
karuah
about
two
miles
within
the
entrance
the
river
winds
between
high
and
steep
banks
densely
covered
with
creepers
acacias
and
other
vegetation
of
a
tropical
character
all
quite
matted
together
and
hanging
in
festoons
the
ends
of
which
are
immersed
in
the
water
white
who
had
charge
of
the
company
stock
met
me
at
boorral
with
horses
and
we
were
not
long
in
reaching
stroud
about
seven
miles
higher
up
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
river
it
is
the
of
the
company
and
has
quite
the
appearance
of
a
truly
english
village
each
cottage
having
its
neat
little
garden
i
was
very
much
pleased
with
the
whole
arrangement
of
the
place
as
i
strolled
through
it
in
the
evening
and
was
delighted
to
find
the
inhabitants
of
a
remote
part
of
australia
retaining
such
vivid
recollection
of
tastes
so
characteristic
of
englishmen
several
experiments
had
been
tried
in
clearing
the
land
in
the
neighbourhood
of
stroud
one
of
which
was
by
what
they
call
ringing
the
trees
that
is
to
say
they
cut
off
a
large
circular
band
of
bark
which
destroying
the
trees
renders
them
easier
to
be
felled
but
the
danger
of
this
practice
was
that
in
stormy
weather
they
were
blown
down
thereby
endangering
the
lives
of
persons
or
stock
passing
in
the
thickets
near
stroud
great
numbers
of
the
lyre
bird
are
found
they
receive
their
names
from
the
shape
of
their
tails
which
one
could
hardly
suppose
so
small
a
bird
having
no
other
beauty
could
possess
trip
up
the
country
at
white
hospitable
cottage
i
met
two
gentlemen
on
their
way
to
the
hunter
river
and
as
fortunately
the
route
i
proposed
taking
lay
in
that
direction
we
started
together
early
the
next
morning
crossing
the
karuah
our
road
for
some
distance
lay
over
a
rugged
country
along
a
winding
path
between
very
steep
hills
six
miles
from
stroud
we
passed
through
a
range
trending
from
two
to
three
thousand
feet
high
the
debris
from
which
enrich
the
flats
of
the
karuah
on
its
eastern
and
the
williams
river
on
its
western
side
our
guide
amused
me
by
pointing
to
some
of
the
steep
parts
of
the
range
which
he
had
galloped
down
while
hunting
wild
cattle
the
most
useful
and
exciting
sport
known
in
australia
useful
inasmuch
as
it
prevents
the
wild
cattle
from
coming
down
to
the
plains
and
enticing
away
the
tame
herds
and
exciting
from
the
rough
nature
of
the
country
in
which
the
sport
is
pursued
wild
cattle
the
wild
cattle
invariably
keep
on
high
ranges
and
from
their
acuteness
of
smell
are
difficult
to
get
at
and
it
is
only
to
leeward
that
one
can
approach
them
the
bulls
being
the
leaders
of
the
herds
are
always
singled
out
and
after
a
desperate
and
trying
gallop
over
a
rugged
country
the
huntsman
finds
himself
going
stride
for
stride
alongside
one
of
these
kings
of
the
forest
and
wondering
how
an
animal
so
ungainly
in
his
gait
can
get
over
the
country
at
such
a
pace
jumping
over
fallen
trees
and
dodging
round
others
he
at
last
finds
himself
on
a
clear
spot
when
drawing
a
pistol
from
his
holster
and
riding
up
so
as
almost
to
touch
the
animal
side
he
lodges
a
well
directed
ball
just
behind
the
fore
shoulder
this
is
the
most
critical
moment
great
command
of
your
horse
is
required
for
the
bull
if
not
mortally
wounded
turns
suddenly
half
mad
with
rage
on
his
pursuer
and
puts
his
nerves
and
judgment
to
a
severe
test
on
these
occasions
almost
incredible
feats
of
horsemanship
are
performed
and
nearly
precipitous
slopes
are
descended
i
have
seen
similar
exploits
nowhere
but
in
chile
where
horses
are
ridden
down
the
sides
of
frightful
ravines
on
their
haunches
at
half
speed
for
bets
but
in
that
country
the
severity
of
the
bit
gives
the
rider
a
power
over
his
steed
unknown
elsewhere
incivility
of
a
settler
we
crossed
the
williams
river
about
fifteen
miles
from
stroud
and
after
nearly
another
hour
ride
came
to
a
place
called
wallaroba
i
was
here
doomed
to
experience
the
only
instance
of
incivility
i
ever
found
in
australia
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
of
a
cold
blustering
day
and
having
breakfasted
early
we
were
prompted
to
test
the
hospitality
of
a
chapman
whose
station
we
were
passing
it
was
the
only
one
we
had
seen
during
the
day
and
knowing
the
possibility
of
our
being
mistaken
for
we
turned
back
our
rough
coats
and
rode
up
to
the
house
as
smart
as
we
could
make
ourselves
we
met
the
owner
standing
in
the
gateway
of
the
garden
fronting
the
house
which
he
nearly
filled
but
although
presenting
a
john
bull
exterior
there
was
a
great
deficiency
of
the
national
character
within
after
introducing
ourselves
we
asked
for
a
little
milk
but
were
refused
on
the
plea
that
there
was
none
at
the
station
our
surly
informant
added
that
we
should
find
a
comfortable
inn
eight
miles
farther
on
first
looking
at
the
number
of
fine
milch
cows
that
were
grazing
near
and
then
at
the
speaker
we
turned
and
left
him
in
silent
disgust
escaped
convicts
who
live
by
plundering
the
settlers
taking
also
their
lives
if
any
resistance
is
offered
i
remember
on
one
occasion
a
party
of
gentlemen
had
their
horses
taken
from
them
one
of
them
was
of
great
value
and
the
owner
thought
he
would
try
an
experiment
to
recover
him
by
saying
in
a
jocular
manner
that
he
would
tie
a
card
with
his
address
round
the
animal
neck
in
order
that
when
done
with
they
might
know
where
to
return
him
strange
to
say
his
experiment
succeeded
as
the
horse
was
sent
back
a
short
time
afterwards
we
passed
the
night
at
the
inn
to
which
we
had
been
directed
and
next
morning
i
separated
from
my
companions
our
roads
being
different
there
had
been
a
hoar
frost
during
the
night
and
the
morning
was
delightfully
bracing
about
ten
miles
in
a
direction
brought
me
to
the
end
of
my
journey
at
cam
yr
allyn
the
residence
of
boydell
a
few
miles
from
this
place
i
passed
the
house
of
a
townsend
the
road
close
to
which
was
literally
through
a
garden
of
roses
which
in
the
freshness
of
the
morning
diffused
a
delicious
fragrance
boydell
residence
is
on
a
rich
spot
of
ground
on
the
banks
of
the
allyn
river
which
runs
among
the
spurs
of
a
range
of
hills
trending
and
distant
about
six
miles
to
the
eastward
where
it
attains
an
elevation
of
three
or
four
thousand
feet
sagacity
of
the
horse
the
country
in
the
neighbourhood
is
very
hilly
and
intersected
by
deep
narrow
valleys
or
ravines
i
was
very
much
amused
by
the
sagacity
displayed
by
the
horses
in
crossing
these
they
make
a
point
as
soon
as
they
get
near
the
bottom
on
one
side
of
dashing
down
at
a
most
tremendous
pace
in
order
to
gain
an
impetus
that
shall
carry
them
up
the
opposite
acclivity
the
first
time
the
animal
i
rode
exhibited
this
instance
of
forethought
i
imagined
he
was
about
to
run
away
with
me
for
suddenly
without
giving
the
least
warning
he
made
a
rush
in
a
downward
direction
and
was
across
the
valley
before
i
could
look
round
all
the
hills
in
this
part
of
the
country
showed
singular
sloping
sides
to
the
whilst
on
the
opposite
they
were
almost
perpendicular
old
red
sandstone
is
generally
found
on
their
sides
and
granite
on
their
summit
on
the
allyn
i
noticed
the
same
kind
of
rich
limestone
that
i
found
on
the
west
bank
of
the
karuah
two
miles
within
the
entrance
these
two
spots
are
about
thirty
miles
apart
the
rocks
in
the
valley
of
the
karuah
belong
to
the
transition
series
and
on
the
shore
of
port
stephens
they
consist
of
porphyry
basalt
and
greenstone
an
instance
here
came
under
my
own
observation
of
the
beneficial
results
which
sometimes
arise
from
the
punishment
of
transportation
knowing
the
difficulty
of
getting
good
servants
i
was
curious
to
learn
how
boydell
had
procured
his
excellent
butler
and
on
inquiry
was
surprised
to
learn
that
he
had
been
sent
out
for
robbing
madame
vestris
of
her
jewels
cultivation
of
tobacco
boydell
was
cultivating
tobacco
to
some
considerable
extent
with
the
hope
of
being
able
to
supply
the
colony
others
who
speculated
on
a
larger
scale
were
ruined
for
it
soon
turned
out
that
it
was
impossible
to
compete
in
cheapness
with
american
tobacco
this
was
in
consequence
of
the
extensive
establishment
required
on
the
estate
the
large
drying
sheds
that
had
to
be
erected
the
number
of
coopers
necessary
and
the
general
high
price
of
labour
boydell
was
also
cultivating
the
vine
of
which
he
made
a
light
kind
of
wine
a
very
excellent
species
of
hock
the
mcarthurs
have
been
at
great
expense
in
promoting
this
branch
of
cultivation
and
are
entitled
to
their
share
of
credit
but
to
bushby
the
colony
owes
the
first
introduction
of
the
grape
which
will
hereafter
prove
of
inestimable
benefit
from
the
great
commerce
to
which
it
must
give
rise
i
may
here
mention
that
the
same
gentleman
has
deserved
highly
of
his
by
having
been
the
means
of
bringing
good
water
from
some
distance
into
sydney
the
importance
of
this
to
the
town
was
very
apparent
even
to
us
transient
visitors
from
the
crowd
of
water
carts
we
constantly
saw
during
the
severe
drought
patiently
waiting
their
turn
to
fill
from
the
pump
in
hyde
park
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
two
gentlemen
to
return
with
as
companions
from
cam
yr
allyn
which
we
left
early
under
the
guidance
of
a
native
mounted
on
one
of
boydell
horses
we
were
to
have
made
a
short
cut
by
crossing
the
hilly
country
but
after
going
some
distance
we
found
our
guide
at
fault
and
he
very
innocently
acknowledged
himself
to
be
as
he
termed
it
murry
stupid
it
was
a
long
time
he
said
since
he
had
travelled
that
way
having
however
provided
myself
with
a
sketch
of
the
country
and
a
compass
i
was
enabled
to
conduct
the
party
out
of
this
dilemma
a
clearing
lease
on
reaching
the
banks
of
william
river
we
inquired
our
way
at
a
cottage
whose
occupants
i
found
held
a
small
piece
of
land
on
what
is
called
a
clearing
lease
that
is
to
say
they
were
allowed
to
retain
possession
of
it
for
so
many
years
for
the
labour
of
clearing
the
land
many
an
industrious
poor
man
is
raised
to
opulence
by
this
means
a
pair
of
oxen
being
all
that
is
necessary
to
set
them
going
with
them
they
drag
away
the
fallen
timber
and
afterwards
plough
the
land
it
is
astonishing
to
see
what
work
oxen
will
do
they
drag
drays
over
almost
incredible
steeps
not
quartering
them
as
horses
do
but
going
straight
up
be
the
hills
ever
so
steep
we
learnt
here
that
the
township
of
dungog
through
which
our
road
to
stroud
lay
was
close
by
we
should
readily
know
it
we
were
informed
by
the
a
place
of
confinement
for
misbehavers
and
generally
the
first
building
in
australian
towns
the
particular
erection
alluded
to
seemed
to
be
well
known
in
the
neighbourhood
as
we
crossed
the
william
river
i
was
much
struck
with
the
richness
of
the
flats
on
its
banks
crossing
the
karuah
in
fording
the
karuah
just
before
reaching
stroud
the
effect
was
singular
and
startling
the
thick
foliage
arching
over
the
river
quite
shut
out
the
little
light
the
stars
afforded
and
as
we
had
to
descend
into
it
down
a
very
steep
bank
it
was
like
plunging
into
a
dark
bottomless
pit
the
noise
of
the
stream
over
the
stones
alone
told
us
we
should
find
a
footing
below
into
this
gloomy
cave
our
party
one
by
one
descended
the
foremost
calling
out
when
he
had
reached
the
bottom
that
the
way
was
clear
and
hastening
across
to
prevent
the
horseman
who
followed
from
being
carried
by
the
impetus
into
contact
with
him
waiting
my
turn
upon
the
verge
of
the
bank
i
contemplated
with
pleasure
the
heavy
masses
of
the
forest
stretching
like
dark
shadows
behind
me
and
on
the
other
side
the
long
winding
line
of
verdure
at
my
feet
from
beneath
which
rose
the
splashing
rippling
gushing
sound
of
the
stream
whilst
overhead
the
vault
of
heaven
was
thick
inlaid
with
patterns
of
bright
gold
but
the
plunge
of
my
companion
horse
in
the
water
and
his
voice
calling
out
that
all
was
right
soon
drew
me
away
and
in
another
moment
i
was
fording
in
utter
darkness
the
rapid
though
shallow
stream
of
the
karuah
we
passed
the
night
at
stroud
and
next
morning
started
for
port
stephens
there
having
been
some
delay
in
getting
my
horse
i
was
obliged
to
push
over
the
first
seven
miles
in
little
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
postman
having
waited
for
me
over
his
time
port
stephens
on
the
the
requisite
observations
were
obtained
for
rating
the
chronometers
which
we
found
had
altered
their
rates
in
a
most
singular
manner
so
much
so
that
in
spite
of
the
short
interval
that
had
elapsed
since
our
departure
from
sydney
we
found
the
resulting
meridian
distance
between
that
place
and
port
stephens
to
be
very
defective
this
fact
illustrates
the
unaccountable
changes
that
sometimes
occur
in
the
rates
of
chronometers
and
the
necessity
of
repeated
measures
of
difference
of
longitude
to
arrive
at
the
truth
on
the
morning
of
the
we
again
sailed
for
the
north
coast
with
a
fine
southerly
wind
june
at
noon
when
in
fathoms
with
coarse
sand
bottom
we
saw
indian
head
bearing
miles
it
is
a
dark
cliffy
point
but
there
is
another
more
remarkable
in
the
shape
of
a
quoin
three
or
four
miles
to
the
northward
at
we
were
in
the
same
depth
sandy
cape
so
named
by
cook
for
its
being
a
low
point
streaked
with
patches
of
white
sand
bearing
eight
miles
as
it
was
now
blowing
very
hard
from
with
constant
squalls
and
thick
rainy
weather
the
ship
was
brought
to
the
wind
under
snug
sail
for
the
night
june
at
daylight
we
were
in
fathoms
the
outer
elbow
of
breaksea
spit
bearing
by
south
three
miles
large
shark
it
was
when
anchored
under
this
spit
that
in
britomart
a
monstrous
shark
was
caught
about
twenty
feet
long
in
which
were
found
the
bones
of
some
very
large
animal
possibly
those
of
a
bullock
that
had
been
carried
out
to
sea
by
some
current
steering
we
deepened
the
water
in
eight
miles
to
fathoms
and
after
rounding
the
northern
extremity
of
breaksea
spit
which
appeared
to
be
formed
of
a
few
detached
breakers
steered
west
by
north
for
bustard
bay
in
fathoms
with
fine
sand
we
passed
three
miles
south
of
lady
elliott
island
a
small
level
spot
about
seventy
feet
high
fringed
with
a
coral
reef
particularly
to
the
and
forming
the
south
eastern
isle
of
bunker
group
it
was
first
seen
at
the
distance
of
seven
miles
from
the
beagle
poop
the
height
of
the
eye
being
fifteen
feet
and
at
that
number
of
miles
east
of
it
we
had
thirty
fathoms
the
weather
was
still
very
hazy
but
the
wind
had
subsided
to
a
light
breeze
from
after
passing
breaksea
spit
a
westerly
current
was
felt
of
nearly
a
knot
an
hour
which
was
also
found
to
be
the
case
in
june
june
the
morning
was
bright
and
sunny
a
happy
change
after
several
days
of
thick
rainy
and
boisterous
weather
the
remarkable
features
in
this
part
of

of

out
in
bold
relief
against
the
pure

was
seen
miles
from
the
beagle
poop
and
is
a
good
guide
for
bustard

we
found
to
be
feet
high

form
admirable
points
for
fixing
the
position
of
the
groups
of
isles
fronting
this
part
of
the
coast
coral
bank
in
the
evening
steering
by
west
we
passed
over
a
coral
bank
three
miles
wide
the
least
water
on
which
was
nine
fathoms
from
this
depth
we
procured
a
specimen
of
living
coral
this
bank
was
again
crossed
in
june
a
mile
and
a
half
further
to
the
when
the
depth
was
only
seven
fathoms
it
lies
eight
miles
from
a
low
islet
four
miles
from
which
in
a
direction
is
a
coral

nearly
dry
this
islet
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
to
which
we
gave
the
name
of

the
of
a

fronting

the
latter
has
a
hump
on
its
extreme
resembling

by
our
is
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
seconds
south
which
is
two
miles
south
of
its
position
in
the
chart
as
we
were
detained
by
light
winds
in
the
neighbourhood
i
had
more
than
one
opportunity
of
detecting
this
error
by
midnight
we
were
about
miles
north
by
west
from
cape
capricorn
when
we
felt
a
swell
from
the
eastward
which
assured
me
there
was
an
opening
in
the
reefs
on
the
north
side
of
the
group
of
islets
fronting
the
cape
hummock

alike
in
error
with

but
all
the
distant
points
agree
with
the
beagle
observation
flat
island
june
there
was
a
light
air
from
till
near
noon
then
one
from
seaward
which
freshened
and
became
in
the
afternoon
steady
at
a
quarter
it
afterwards
prevailed
from
we
were
at
the
time
passing
about
three
miles
from
flat
island
in
fathoms
an
increase
in
the
soundings
we
had
but
just
got
into
we
were
glad
to
find
the
ship
position
fixed
by
points
both
far
and
near
agree
with
the
observations
a
fact
i
can
only
account
for
here
from
the
circumstance
that
flinders
laid
down
the
coast
about
port
bowen
by
observations
on
shore
whereas
that
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cape
capricorn
was
from
those
made
with
the
which
he
found
differ
very
materially
during
the
day
we
added
to
the
chart
the
position
of
two
peaks
feet
high
lying
about
miles
by
west
from
cape

and
forming
the
northern

also
noticed

was

june
from
thence
we
steered
to
pass
between
number
and
number
of
the
northumberland
isles
in
order
that
we
might
lay
down
their
outlines
correctly
and
also
determine
the
positions
of
some
small
islets
lying
on
the
side
of
number
the
most
remarkable
land
in
sight
in
the
morning
was
mount
westall
named
by
flinders
after
the
talented
artist
who
accompanied
him
and
which
forms
the
highest
part
of
the
eastern
shore
of
shoalwater
bay
the
soundings
during
the
night
were
very
regular
only
varying
from
to
fathoms
with
a
soft
muddy
bottom
mixed
occasionally
with
which
the
lead
brought
up
small
stones
the
summit

of
the
northumberland

forms
a
remarkable
peak
feet
high
a
sandy
bay
on
the
west
side
promised
good
anchorage
and
on
its
and
northern
sides
were
some
high
detached
rocks
the
heights
of
the
other
parts
of
the
group
vary
from
two
to
six
hundred
feet
the
crests
of
the
western
isles
are
covered
with
pine
trees
which
give
them
a
curious
jagged
appearance
in
the
afternoon
we
passed
in
fathoms
four
miles
from
the
eastern
side
of
the
percy
isles
which
enabled
us
to
add
their
eastern
extremity
in
the
chart
the
mainland
falling
so
much
back
soon
after
passing
port
bowen
we
could
form
no
idea
of
its
character
but
certainly
what
we
had
seen
did
not
leave
a
favourable
impression
of
its
apparent
fertility
sandalwood
captains
flinders
and
king
having
given
a
description
of
the
percy
isles
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
say
anything
about
them
further
than
that
they
are
composed
of
a
compound
with
an
aspect
of
serpentine
and
that
either
on
them
or
the
northumberland
isles

been
found
of

taken
by

bearing
miles
our
course
was
now
shaped
for
cape

the
extreme
of
the
cumberland
isles
and
about
this
time
we
felt
the
setting
by
west
nearly
a
knot
an
hour
a
sure
indication
of
there
being
openings
in
the
barriers
in
that
direction
the
great
distance
at
which
this
part
of
it
lies
from
the
islands
will
render
its
examination
a
difficult
and
hazardous
undertaking
the
night
was
anything
but
favourable
for
sailing
among
islands
being
very
hazy
with
passing
rain
squalls
at
midnight
we
passed
nearly
two
miles
from
the
side
of
k
of
the
cumberland
group
in
fathoms
in
which
depth
we
continued
till
getting
abreast
of

the
next
evening
the
when
it
increased
to

still
on

which
at
that
part
was
nearly
feet
high
yet
the
night
was
so
hazy
that
it
was
only
visible
at
intervals
here
we
noticed
many
ripplings
which
we
afterwards
found
indicated
a
current
of
a
knot
and
a
half
an
hour
caused
no
doubt
by
the
proximity
of
a
part
of
the
barrier
the
distance
between
it
and
cape
gloucester
being
only
miles
i
may
here
observe
that
the
barometer
was
very
high
with
these
fresh
winds
and
hazy
weather
and
rather
low
during
the
light
winds
we
experienced
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cape
capricorn
cape
upstart
june
at
daylight
the
beagle
was
a
few
miles
east
of
cape
upstart
in
fathoms
having
passed
two
miles
from
the
north
side
of
holborn
island
in
fathoms
the
above
headland
received
its
name
from
captain
cook
and
peculiarly
deserves
it
appearing
in
fact
from
the
lowness
of
the
land
behind
actually
to
start
up
out
of
the
water
chronometers
being
chiefly
affected
by
changes
of
temperature
it
was
necessary
to
ascertain
the
rates
of
those
in
the
beagle
again
before
reaching
port
essington
for
a
correct
measurement
of
the
difference
of
meridians
between
that
place
and
port
stephens
the
bay
on
the
west
side
of
cape
upstart
had
been
recommended
by
captain
king
for
that
purpose
as
he
had
considered
it
likely
to
be
the
mouth
of
an
opening
this
conjecture
the
low
land
in
the
head
of
the
bay
together
with
a
singular
break
in
the
distant
hills
seemed
fully
to
justify
we
accordingly
entered
the
bay
and
anchored
half
a
mile
within
the
point
this
took
us
till
the
afternoon
to
reach
in
consequence
of
our
having
a
light
land
breeze
until
when
it
became
steady
from
drawing
round
to
south
after
sunset
and
veering
to
again
in
the
morning
this
alternation
of
land
and
seabreezes
continued
during
our
stay
for
three
or
four
successive
days
in
the
evening
we
landed
and
ascended
the
extremity
of
the
cape
from
whence
we
saw
at
once
that
hopes
of
discovering
any
opening
were
delusive
the
low
shores
of
the
bay
could
be
traced
all
round
except
in
the
corner
where
a
point
shut
out
our
view
exploration
of
a
river
on
sweeping
the
western
shore
with
a
spyglass
i
discovered
the
mouth
of
a
river
about
a
mile
to
the
north
of
a
hillock
marked
in
captain
chart
this
river
was
made
the
object
of
an
exploring
party
and
next
day
captain
wickham
and
lieutenant
eden
went
on
that
interesting
service
it
has
two
entrances
both
very
shallow
and
is
of
little
importance
being
on
a
lee
shore
and
fronted
by
a
bar
which
seems
to
break
at
all
times
of
the
tide
however
as
there
is
such
very
safe
anchorage
near
the
discovery
may
hereafter
prove
of
some
value
captain
wickham
found
it
fresh
ten
miles
from
the
entrance
but
at
that
point
it
is
nearly
lost
in
the
sands
and
so
very
shallow
that
the
natives
have
a
fishing
weir
across
it
the
land
which
appears
to
be
much
cut
up
with
creeks
is
very
flat
on
both
sides
and
is
subject
to
inundations
this
was
evident
from
the
signs
of
drift
to
the
height
of
six
feet
on
the
trees
that
grew
along
the
banks
themselves
not
more
than
a
couple
of
yards
above
mark
the
exploring
party
saw
a
few
natives
but
they
were
too
shy
to
communicate
one
was
discovered
on
a
long
flat
crawling
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
strange
intruders
and
looking
more
like
a
great
insect
than
a
man
in
the
distance
up
the
river
a
good
many
smokes
appeared
but
i
doubt
whether
this
may
be
considered
as
denoting
a
densely
populated
country
as
fires
are
kindled
by
the
australian
natives
both
as
signals
and
for
the
purposes
of
hunting
geological
queries
previous
to
my
departure
from
england
i
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
a
valuable
paper
by
my
friend
darwin
on
the
formation
of
coral
islands
read
at
the
geological
society
my
attention
being
thus
awakened
to
the
subject
the
interest
of
this
important
paper
was
to
me
greatly
enhanced
by
a
series
of
queries
kindly
furnished
by
darwin
and
drawn
up
with
a
view
to
confirm
or
invalidate
his
views
his
purpose
being
to
elicit
truth
from
a
combination
of
well
attested
facts
and
by
inducing
the
research
of
others
to
further
the
objects
of
science
among
these
queries
was
the
following
are
there
masses
of
coral
or
beds
of
shells
some
yards
above
high
water
mark
on
the
coast
fronting
the
barrier
reef
see
also
the
hydrographer
instructions
supra
raised
beaches
captain
king
in
answer
to
the
above
states
that
some
of
the
islands
within
the
reef
have
beaches
of
broken
coral
and
as
an
instance
he
refers
to
fitzroy
island
i
will
myself
here
adduce
what
may
be
deemed
an
important
fact
and
which
if
allowed
its
due
weight
will
go
far
to
weaken
the
arguments
brought
forward
in
favour
of
the
subsidence
of
the
coast
of
australia
i
found
a
flat
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
broad
in
a
quiet
sheltered
cove
within
the
cape
thickly
strewed
with
dead
coral
and
shells
forming
in
fact
a
perfect
bed
of
them
a
raised
beach
of
twelve
feet
above
mark
on
the
sandy
beach
fronting
it
also
a
few
feet
above
mark
was
a
concretion
of
sand
and
dead
coral
forming
a
mass
about
fifty
yards
long
fronting
this
for
about
the
width
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
was
a
wall
of
coral
with
two
feet
water
on
it
and
immediately
outside
five
fathoms
with
a
fine
sandy
bottom
slightly
sloping
off
the
annexed
woodcut
will
better
explain
what
we
have
here
endeavoured
to
bring
before
the
reader
section
of
the
coast
this
small
flat
where
our
observations
were
made
and
the
results
of
which
are
as
follows
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
longitude
degrees
minutes
east
of
port
essington
is
surrounded
by
an
amphitheatre
of
hills
had
it
been
on
the
seaward
side
of
the
cape
i
might
have
been
readier
to
imagine
that
it
could
have
been
thrown
up
by
the
sea
in
its
ordinary
action
or
when
suddenly
disturbed
by
an
earthquake
wave
but
as
the
contrary
is
the
case
it
seemed
impossible
to
come
to
any
other
conclusion
than
that
an
upheaval
had
taken
place
the
whole
of
cape
upstart
is
a
granite
mass
and
its
crests
are
covered
with
boulders
some
of
which
have
rolled
down
and
form
rather
conspicuous
objects
on
the
shores
and
points
of
the
bay
pumice
stone
near
the
extremity
of
the
cape
just
at
mark
i
noticed
some
pumice
stones
small
and
not
having
the
appearance
of
belonging
to
a
recent
eruption
which
seems
to
agree
with
the
opinion
expressed
by
the
reverend
clarke
in
the
tasmanian
journal
he
considers
and
i
think
justly
that
its
origin
may
be
in
the
solomon
new
caledonia
or
some
other
of
the
volcanic
islands
to
the
east
of
australia
from
whence
it
drifted
as
it
has
been
found
on
all
parts
of
the
coast
to
the
southern
portion
of
which
it
has
doubtless
been
carried
by
the
current
captain
wickham
did
not
remark
any
above
the
entrance
of
the
river
he
explored
on
the
western
side
of
the
bay
which
bears
out
the
opinion
i
have
above
expressed
a
curious
fact
mentioned
by
clarke
is
that
one
piece
perfectly
was
found
upon
a
high
mountain
full
miles
inland
from
the
mouth
of
clarence
river
was
this
carried
thither
by
one
of
the
natives
or
does
it
indicate
that
pumice
drifted
to
this
part
of
the
continent
at
a
time
when
if
ever
it
was
on
a
level
with
the
ocean
i
further
remarked
in
this
place
many
of
the
land
shells
common
to
this
and
other
parts
of
the
coast
there
was
great
difficulty
in
attaining
the
loftiest
point
of
the
cape
which
i
found
to
be
two
thousand
feet
high
from
thence
our
party
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
of
the
bay
and
discovered
that
we
were
strictly
speaking
standing
upon
an
island
a
small
creek
winding
round
the
southern
foot
of
the
high
land
and
connecting
the
bays
on
the
eastern
and
western
side
of
cape
upstart
the
break
in
the
hills
seen
by
captain
king
and
supposed
to
indicate
an
opening
has
been
already
alluded
to
on
reaching
the
summit
i
found
that
this
was
merely
a
valley
containing
the
head
of
the
plain
which
stretched
from
the
shores
of
the
bay
on
its
southern
side
rose
mount
abbott
but
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
on
the
coast
is
mount
elliott
lying
about
miles
west
and
by
north
from
our
position
it
is
a
long
level
hill
with
a
peak
at
its
northern
extremity
all
those
in
the
neighbourhood
as
far
as
i
could
judge
with
the
spyglass
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
formation
with
cape
upstart
we
found
this
a
convenient
for
vessels
making
the
inner
passage
wood
and
water
being
easily
procured
the
latter
is
found
in
a
considerable
reservoir
fed
by
two
streams
from
the
high
land
of
the
cape
lying
a
mile
within
the
mouth
of
the
bay
from
appearances
i
should
say
it
would
yield
an
abundant
supply
at
any
season
of
the
year
natives
surprised
there
were
a
few
natives
loitering
about
on
cape
upstart
when
we
arrived
and
i
think
we
should
have
communicated
with
them
had
it
not
been
for
the
fright
into
which
they
were
accidentally
thrown
a
boat
crew
on
landing
surprised
a
small
party
which
instantly
dispersed
in
various
directions
a
lad
however
instead
of
escaping
with
the
rest
stowed
himself
away
in
a
crack
between
two
boulders
of
granite
every
endeavour
was
made
to
get
him
to
come
out
of
his
hidingplace
biscuit
was
offered
him
but
he
snapped
savagely
with
his
teeth
at
the
hand
that
held
it
finding
all
attempts
fruitless
he
was
left
and
no
doubt
the
account
he
gave
his
comrades
of
us
while
under
the
influence
of
fright
was
sufficiently
terrible
to
take
them
all
away
from
the
neighbourhood
these
natives
used
nets
similar
to
those
i
had
seen
on
the
coast
and
in
their
make
resembling
in
a
remarkable
manner
the
ones
employed
by
europeans
plants
and
animals
in
the
valley
just
within
cape
upstart
a
few
palms
and
a
species
of
cotton
were
growing
and
in
other
places
the
eucalyptus
of
small
growth
certain
were
also
found
apparently
of
the
same
species
as
those
on
the
percy
isles
several
of
which
we
removed
and
presented
to
the
botanical
garden
at
sydney
where
we
afterwards
had
the
gratification
of
seeing
them
in
a
flourishing
state
crinum
angustifolium
they
belong
to
the
narcissus
but
are
in
themselves
a
new
order
of
plant
a
few
quails
were
shot
of
the
same
large
kind
as
that
found
on
all
other
parts
of
the
continent
also
one
or
two
pheasant
cuckoos
they
did
not
differ
from
those
we
killed
on
the
coast
although
nearly
five
degrees
further
south
a
very
large
pigeon
was
also
shot
resembling
in
colour
the
common
blue
rock
but
without
a
bronze
mark
we
had
not
seen
this
species
before
it
was
a
very
wary
bird
and
was
found
in
the
rocks
centropus
phasianellus
gould
new
kangaroo
but
the
greatest
prize
our
sportsmen
shot
was
a
specimen
of
a
small
female
kangaroo
of
a
new
kind
deposited
in
the
british
museum
and
figured
as
petrogale
inanata
by
gould
who
being
misinformed
has
described
it
as
inhabiting
the
north
coast
of
australia
it
measured
as
follows
just
after
it
was
killed
length
of
body
from
tip
of

gradually
increasing
in
length
from

centre
to
the

and
terminating
in
a
tuft
on
the
back
of
the
hind
legs
the
hair
is
longer
than
on
any
other
part
of
the
body
the
nails
on
the
hind

were
short
covered
with
long
hair
and
did
not
project
over
the
pulpy
part
of
the
foot
which
is
well
cushioned
and
rough
giving
a
firm
hold
to
projecting
rocks
the
head
was
small
and
sharp
towards
the
muzzle
the
ears
were
short
and
slightly
rounded
the
eyes
black
and
the
forearms
very
short

this
animal
the

was
very
superficial
it
inhabits
the
most
rugged
summits
taking
refuge
in
the
clefts
of
the
rocks
june
in
the
afternoon
we
left
the
anchorage
we
had
been
the
first
to
occupy
and
standing
out
of
the
bay
were
much
struck
by
the
rugged
outline
cape
upstart
presents
the
huge
boulders
scattered
over
the
crest
of
the
hills
give
it
the
appearance
of
a
vast
mass
of
ruins
the
clear
atmosphere
bringing
it
out
in
bold
relief
against
the
sky
we
stood
over
for
the
opposite
shore
and
closing
to
within
three
miles
of
the
land
changed
our
course
and
ran
along
the
singular
low
point
forming
the
coastline
to
the
of
cape
upstart
and
by
rounded
its
northern
extreme
called
cape
bowling
green
at
a
distance
of
six
miles
in
fathoms
steering
then
to
pass
about
four
miles
outside
the
palm
isles
during
the
whole
night
our
soundings
only
varied
from
to
fathoms
magnetical
island
the
weather
was
gloomy
with
passing
showers
of
rain
and
a
moderate
breeze
but
all
was
bright
again
by
daylight
july
when
magnetical
island
bore
south
degrees
west
and
the
south
and
largest
of
the
palm
isles
north
degrees
west
which
corresponding
with
the
log
showed
there
had
been
no
current
during
the
night
magnetical
island
was
so
named
by
cook
because
he
fancied
it
affected
the
endeavour
compass
in
passing
it
there
is
good
anchorage
on
the
west
side
where
it
is
densely
covered
with
trees
amidst
which
a
few
straggling
pines
reared
their
lofty
and
heads
giving
by
their
variety
a
picturesque
appearance
to
the
scene
we
passed
the
palm
islands
early
in
the
forenoon
the
largest
we
found
to
be
feet
high
with
a
remarkable
white
rock
off
its
extreme
see
the
view
annexed
the
cordillera
behind
these
isles
we
saw
numerous
blue
streaks
of
smoke
from
the
fires
of
the
natives
indicating
the
state
of
population
on
the
slope
of
that
lofty
range
of
hills
which
may
be
called
the
cordillera
of
eastern
australia
and
which
at
this
point
tower
to
a
great
height
overlooking
the
coast
we
were
abreast
about
noon
of
its
most
remarkable
feature
mount
hinchinbrook
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
rising
to
the
height
according
to
our
observations
of
feet
the
proximity
of
this
high
land
to
the
coast
may
account
for
the
gloomy
weather
of
the
previous
night
although
a
number
of
fires
being
once
seen
is
not
always
a
sign
in
australia
of
a
densely
populated
part
of
the
country
yet
when
they
are
constantly
visible
as
in
this
part
of
the
continent
it
is
fair
to
infer
that
the
inhabitants
are
numerous
and
the
soil
fertile
i
might
further
remark
that
captain
king
found
the
natives
well
disposed
and
at
goold
island
in
this
neighbourhood
they
even
came
on
board
his
vessel
uninvited
an
evidence
of
friendship
and
confidence
rarely
characterizing
a
race
of
beings
so
wary
as
are
generally
the
inhabitants
of
australia
it
is
not
a
little
singular
that
the
altitude
of
mount
hinchinbrook
should
be
identical
with
what
strzelecki
considers
the
mean
height
of
the
cordillera
which
he
traced
continually
on
foot
from
to
degrees
south
latitude
giving
to
the
highest
point
feet
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
the
name
of
mount
kosciusko
for
reasons
most
admirably
and
feelingly
expressed
and
which
we
therefore
in
justice
to
his
patriotic
sentiments
give
below
in
his
own
words
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
there
is
a
northerly
dip
in
the
cordillera
of
feet
in
degrees
of
latitude
the
particular
configuration
of
this
eminence
struck
me
so
forcibly
by
the
similarity
it
bears
to
a
tumulus
elevated
in
krakow
over
the
tomb
of
the
patriot
kosciusko
that
although
in
a
foreign
country
on
foreign
ground
but
amongst
a
free
people
who
appreciate
freedom
and
its
votaries
i
could
not
refrain
from
giving
it
the
name
of
mount
kosciusko
the
great
height
of
this
range
and
the
extreme
abruptness
of
its
eastern
face
where
no
waters
are
thrown
off
renders
it
more
than
probable
that
on
the
western
side
there
is
land
of
great
fertility
whatever
waters
originate
on
its
summit
and
slopes
must
flow
towards
the
interior
and
there
give
rise
to
rivers
emptying
themselves
into
the
gulf
of
carpentaria
or
by
first
forming
lagoons
feed
streams
of
some
magnitude
even
during
their
overflow
halifax
bay
it
is
the
general
opinion
of
every
voyager
who
has
sailed
along
the
coast
of
halifax
bay
that
it
is
the
most
interesting
portion
of
the
side
of
the
continent
as
combining
the
several
facts
which
we
have
above
given
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
discovery
of
fertile
and
therefore
valuable
land
will
one
day
reward
the
labours
of
the
explorer
nothing
was
seen
by
us
of
the
san
antonio
reef
laid
down
in
the
charts
as
fronting
the
palm
isles
but
this
was
subsequently
accounted
for
by
captain
stanley
who
found
that
it
was
sixteen
miles
north
of
its
supposed
position
being
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
and
miles
distant
from
the
nearest
land
hillock
point
this
fact
is
the
more
satisfactory
and
important
that
from
its
present
position
as
laid
down
in
the
chart
being
supposed
to
be
near
the
palm
islands
it
was
apt
to
create
an
unpleasant
state
of
anxiety
in
the
mind
of
those
navigating
these
waters
during
thick
weather
or
at
night
from
noon
we
steered
and
at
dunk
island
bore
eight
miles
distant
our
soundings
varying
during
that
period
from
thirteen
to
fifteen
fathoms
during
the
day
we
had
several
opportunities
of
satisfactorily
testing
the
accuracy
of
captain
chart
while
passing
barnard
group
soon
after
dark
we
found
a
current
setting
nearly
a
mile
an
hour
a
rate
at
which
it
kept
during
the
whole
night
but
in
a
direction
during
the
day
we
had
a
light
breeze
from
which
shifted
to
during
the
night
numerous
native
fires
were
observed
burning
on
the
shore
during
the
first
watch
at
the
foot
of
the
bellenden
ker
hills
remarkable
mountains
of
considerable
altitude
fitzroy
island
july
soon
after
midnight
we
were
abreast
of
frankland
group
and
at
passed
three
miles
to
the
eastward
of
fitzroy
island
where
our
soundings
increased
to
seventeen
fathoms
with
a
current
running
upwards
of
a
mile
an
hour
to
the
an
increased
velocity
which
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
proximity
of
the
reefs
to
a
projection
of
the
coast
forming
cape
grafton
i
must
not
however
pass
an
island
which
like
fitzroy
carried
in
its
name
a
pleasing
association
to
many
on
board
the
beagle
without
a
word
of
notice
particularly
as
its
features
are
in
themselves
sufficiently
remarkable
having
a
singular
peaked
summit
feet
high
near
the
end
on
the
western
side
is
a
little
cove
where
captain
king
found
snug
anchorage
reef
near
low
isles
passing
midway
between
green
island
which
is
about
twenty
feet
high
encircled
with
a
coral
reef
and
cape
grafton
we
steered
north
for
a
shoal
on
which
her
majesty
ship
imogene
grounded
and
at
noon
were
exactly
on
the
spot
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
by
observations
and
bearings
of
the
land
low
isles
being
four
miles
here
we
found
sixteen
fathoms
not
having
had
less
than
seventeen
since
the
morning
there
was
no
appearance
of
any
such
reef
nearer
than
that
laid
down
by
lieutenant
roe
bearing
east
from
the
low
isles
and
under
which
her
majesty
ship
tamar
anchored
it
must
therefore
have
been
on
the
part
of
this
reef
that
the
imogene
struck
and
the
south
part
must
be
the
reef
laid
down
in
the
chart
as
having
been
seen
by
her
to
the
southward
which
accounts
for
our
not
seeing
it
from
the
beagle
we
passed
through
several
patches
of
discoloured
water
caused
by
washings
from
reefs
to
windward
which
are
very
deceptive
at
sunset
the
anchor
was
dropped
in
thirteen
fathoms
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
port
stephens
the
south
point
of
weary
bay
bore
three
miles
and
cape
tribulation
south
by
east
six
miles
near
the
middle
of
the
former
i
noticed
a
patch
of
discoloured
water
which
has
since
been
found
by
a
merchant
vessel
to
be
a
shoal
hope
islands
the
land
over
the
latter
place
is
very
high
presenting
several
singular
peaks
one
more
prominent
than
the
rest
in
the
shape
of
a
finger
that
over
trinity
bay
which
we
were
the
greater
part
of
the
day
crossing
is
also
of
great
altitude
in
its
south
corner
we
noticed
the
opening
spoken
of
by
captain
king
lying
in
the
rear
of
some
remarkable
peaks
we
had
been
informed
by
him
that
the
greater
part
of
the
coast
between
weary
bay
and
endeavour
river
including
the
hope
islands
had
been
altered
from
his
original
survey
a
tracing
of
which
he
had
furnished
us
with
previous
to
leaving
sydney
the
few
bearings
we
obtained
while
at
anchor
induced
us
to
consider
it
correct
a
fact
we
further
proved
during
the
early
part
of
the
next
day
run
as
the
course
steered
from
our
anchorage
north
by
west
west
carried
us
a
little
more
than
a
mile
west
of
the
hope
islands
had
their
assigned
position
in
the
chart
been
correct
our
course
would
have
led
us
right
over
the
western
isle
on
detecting
this
error
we
found
it
necessary
to
this
part
of
the
coast
and
it
affords
me
much
pleasure
after
so
doing
to
be
able
to
bear
testimony
to
the
extreme
correctness
of
captain
original
chart
above
alluded
to
soon
after
passing
the
hope
islands
we
saw
the
reef
where
cook
vessel
had
so
miraculous
an
escape
after
grinding
on
the
rocks
for
hours
as
graphically
described
in
his
voyages
it
is
called
endeavour
reef
from
this
circumstance
cape
bedford
continuing
on
the
same
course
we
passed
three
miles
from
cape
bedford
at
this
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
on
the
coast
being
a
bluff
detached
piece
of
tableland
surmounted
by
a
singular
low
line
of
cliffs
reminding
me
forcibly
of
the
hills
on
the
river
santa
cruz
in
eastern
patagonia
as
far
as
i
could
judge
by
the
aid
of
a
good
glass
it
seemed
to
be
composed
of
a
mixture
of
red
sand
and
ironstone
of
a
very
deep
red
hue
bearing
a
great
similarity
to
the
country
on
the
coast
in
latitude
degrees
south
leaving
cape
bedford
we
went
in
search
of
a
shoal
laid
down
by
victor
as
lying
two
miles
to
the
of
three
isles
both
captain
king
and
lieutenant
roe
had
expressed
a
doubt
of
its
existence
in
the
position
marked
a
doubt
which
our
researches
fully
justified
and
therefore
as
it
at
present
stands
it
should
be
expunged
from
the
chart
from
thence
we
steered
north
for
lizard
island
the
remarkable
peak
on
which
soon
rose
in
sight
this
course
took
us
within
three
miles
of
cape
flattery
where
a
couple
of
peaks
with
a
slope
between
them
render
it
a
conspicuous
headland
about
seven
miles
west
from
thence
there
is
a
strange
alteration
in
the
appearance
of
the
country
changing
from
moderately
high
hills
to
lofty
table
ranges
about
or
feet
in
height
trending
about
and
by
west
lizard
island
having
still
a
little
moonlight
we
were
enabled
to
keep
underweigh
part
of
the
night
and
during
the
first
watch
came
to
in
fathoms
in
a
bay
on
the
west
side
of
lizard
island
the
extremes
bearing
from
south
east
to
during
the
day
we
experienced
a
northerly
current
varying
from
three
quarters
to
half
an
knot
an
hour
july
we
remained
at
this
anchorage
until
the
following
morning
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
position
of
the
island
and
of
visiting
the
peak
which
we
found
to
be
nearly
twelve
hundred
feet
high
i
ascended
by
a
slope
rising
from
the
shore
of
the
small
bay
where
our
observations
were
taken
and
which
may
be
easily
distinguished
from
being
the
second
from
the
north
point
of
the
island
their
result
was
to
place
it
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
longitude
degrees
minutes
east
of
port
essington
variation
by
the
mean
of
five
or
six
needles
was
degrees
east
being
half
a
degree
more
than
it
was
at
cape
upstart
other
magnetic
observations
were
also
made
consisting
of
those
for
the
dip
and
intensity
in
a
valley
to
the
left
of
the
slope
by
which
we
ascended
the
peak
were
noticed
several
very
remarkable
low
and
spreading
trees
with
a
dark
green
foliage
and
leaves
large
ovate
and
obtuse
the
branches
from
which
when
broken
a
milky
juice
exuded
were
thick
and
glossy
of
an
ash
colour
at
their
extremity
they
were
thin
with
long
pendulous
stems
supporting
a
flower
of
a
rich
crimson
hue
these
hung
in
great
profusion
and
contrasting
with
the
surrounding
dark
green
verdure
presented
a
very
beautiful
and
striking
appearance
the
diameter
of
the
trunk
of
the
largest
tree
was
inches
and
the
height
feet
lieutenant
emery
painted
a
most
faithful
representation
of
one
of
them
by
means
of
which
we
found
on
our
arrival
at
port
essington
that
neither
the
professional
nor
amateur
botanists
had
any
knowledge
of
it
to
them
and
to
ourselves
it
was
alike
perfectly
new
captain
cook
on
the
preceding
evening
i
had
refreshed
my
memory
by
reading
account
of
his
visit
to
the
same
spot
and
was
thus
able
minutely
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
the
immortal
navigator
there
is
an
inexpressible
charm
in
thus
treading
in
the
track
of
the
mighty
dead
and
my
feelings
on
attaining
the
summit
of
the
peak
where
the
foot
of
the
white
man
had
perhaps
but
once
before
rested
will
easily
be
understood
below
to
the
eastward
stretched
a
vast
expanse
of
water
broken
at
the
distance
of
about
eight
miles
by
a
long
narrow
line
of
detached
reefs
on
which
there
ran
a
white
crest
of
foaming
breakers
marking
the
outer
edge
of
the
great
barrier
a
name
which
few
seamen
could
hear
with
indifference
when
in
its
vicinity
if
i
felt
emotions
of
delight
on
first
perceiving
the
extent
of
a
danger
so
justly
dreaded
how
much
stronger
must
have
been
the
feelings
of
captain
cook
when
from
the
same
spot
years
before
he
saw
by
a
gap
in
the
line
of
broken
water
there
was
a
chance
of
his
once
more
gaining
the
open
sea
after
being
confined
to
the
eastern
shores
of
the
australian
continent
for
a
distance
of
miles
though
the
dangers
of
this
inner
channel
had
proved
so
nearly
fatal
to
his
ship
the
truth
of
the
homely
adage
which
describes
all
as
happening
for
the
best
was
here
fully
borne
out
as
the
very
fact
of
his
position
enabled
captain
cook
to
make
considerable
discoveries
along
the
coast
just
as
by
the
mishap
on
endeavour
reef
the
presence
of
a
river
was
made
apparent
and
some
slight
knowledge
of
the
aborigines
obtained
as
well
as
numerous
facts
illustrative
of
the
natural
and
vegetable
productions
of
the
locality
providence
channel
little
did
he
think
at
that
time
however
when
standing
on
the
summit
of
the
peak
that
he
was
about
as
it
were
to
thread
the
eye
of
a
needle
by
passing
through
another
break
in
a
manner
which
can
only
be
designated
as
providential
this
gap
in
the
great
reef
is
now
known
as
providence
channel
a
name
which
must
ever
remind
us
of
him
who
in
moments
when
our
lives
hang
as
by
a
thread
is
ever
watchful
and
spares
us
in
the
exercise
of
his
inscrutable
will
carried
back
to
times
past
we
stood
upon
the
summit
of
the
height
dwelling
in
thought
upon
the
adventurous
career
of
the
great
navigator
when
suddenly
as
if
by
magic
the
whole
scene
below
and
around
was
obscured
and
we
found
ourselves
wrapped
in
a
dense
cloud
of
vapour
which
came
sweeping
across
the
island
drenching
us
to
the
skin
with
a
rapidity
which
spoke
volumes
for
the
penetrating
character
of
an
australian
fog
cold
and
shivering
we
hailed
the
temporary
of
the
sun
with
delight
and
our
clothes
were
dried
almost
as
speedily
as
they
had
been
wetted
our
satisfaction
was
however
but
of
short
duration
as
the
same
agreeable
operation
of
alternate
drenching
and
drying
occurred
several
times
during
our
stay
on
the
peak
barrier
reef
the
opening
through
which
captain
cook
passed
out
to
sea
bore
about
north
by
east
miles
the
outer
line
of
the
barrier
reef
curving
from
thence
to
the
and
following
the
trend
of
the
land
when
this
singular
wall
of
coral
the
most
extensive
perhaps
in
the
world
is
surveyed
it
will
i
think
be
found
to
follow
the
direction
of
the
coast
it
fronts
with
such
exactness
as
to
leave
little
doubt
that
the
vast
base
on
which
rests
the
work
of
the
polypifers
was
contrary
to
the
opinion
which
i
am
aware
prevails
upheaved
at
the
same
time
with
the
neighbouring
coast
of
the
australian
continent
which
it
follows
for
a
space
of
upwards
of
a
hundred
miles
coral
reefs
from
the
elevation
on
which
i
stood
i
had
an
excellent
view
of
some
reefs
within
the
barrier
whether
they
encircled
an
islet
or
were
wholly
beneath
the
water
their
form
was
circular
although
from
the
ship
and
indeed
anywhere
viewed
from
a
less
height
they
appeared
this
detection
of
my
own
previously
erroneous
impressions
seemed
to
account
for
the
recurrence
in
charts
of
reefs
others
having
doubtless
fallen
into
the
same
error
it
is
very
remarkable
that
on
the
or
windward
side
of
these
coral
reefs
the
circle
is
of
a
compact
and
perfect
form
as
if
to
resist
the
action
of
the
waves
while
on
the
opposite
side
they
were
jagged
and
broken
in
the
pacific
the
islets
are
generally
on
the
weather
side
of
the
lagoon
reefs
the
side
of
the
peak
rises
perpendicularly
from
a
grassy
flat
which
stretches
across
that
part
of
the
island
separating
two
bays
the
beaches
of
which
with
the
rest
on
the
island
are
composed
of
granulated
quartz
and
coarse
shingle
a
stream
of
water
rising
in
the
peak
runs
through
the
green
while
a
few
low
gumtrees
grow
in
small
detached
clumps
a
ship
may
therefore
procure
both
water
and
fuel
finding
this
to
be
the
case
and
as
it
was
a
convenient
stopping
place
we
made
a
plan
of
the
island
connecting
it
with
those
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
it
is
the
more
advantageous
as
an
anchorage
in
that
it
can
be
reached
during
the
night
whereas
this
could
not
be
done
in
the
inner
channel
near
turtle
islands
it
lying
so
much
to
the
westward
and
being
more
intricate
indeed
it
is
not
prudent
to
approach
these
isles
even
in
the
afternoon
from
the
number
of
reefs
and
the
difficulty
in
seeing
them
with
the
sun
ahead

was
not
fortunate
enough
to
add
to
his
collection
of
birds
those
he
observed
being
only
doves
and
parrots
besides
a
flycatcher
common
to
parts
of
the
coast
and
often
before
met
with
by
us
a
couple
of
vampires
of
the
larger
and
darker
species
were
also
seen

being
thick
we
did
not
discover
the
somewhat
remarkable
peak
on
number
until
we
were
close
to
it
our
progress
was
accelerated
by
a
current
running
half
a
knot
an
hour
and
finding
the
passage
between
number
and
of
howick
group
much
impeded
by
rocks
we
hauled
up
between
and
isles
and
on
keeping
away
again
for
point
barrow
found
ourselves
close
to
a
reef
almost
dry
and
extending
nearly
a
mile
further
off
the
side
of
coles
island
than
is
laid
down
in
the
chart
thus
contracting
the
channel
between
it
and
number
island
to
a
space
of
not
more
than
two
miles
when
the
course
was
shaped
for
point
barrow
noble
island
a
very
remarkable
rocky
height
was
a
point
on
the
port
bow
its
singular
appearance
makes
it
conspicuous
amid
the
recollections
of
this
part
of
the
coast
we
now
once
more
approached
to
within
a
distance
of
seven
miles
of
the
mainland
which
presented
to
our
view
a
low
sandy
shore
with
a
few
remarkable
hummocks
rising
over
it
and
somewhat
high
broken
rocky
land
immediately
behind
cape
melville
passing
point
barrow
we
anchored
near
the
north
end
of
a
large
reef
cape
melville
bearing
ten
miles
here
we
felt
a
swell
rolling
in
from
seaward
and
during
the
day
there
had
been
a
current
in
our
favour
of
about
a
mile
an
hour
from
the
haze
on
the
horizon
noticed
from
this
anchorage
as
well
as
on
passing
cape
melville
i
believe
the
outer
edge
of
the
barrier
reef
to
be
not
more
than
four
or
five
leagues
distant
from
the
land
our
attention
had
been
previously
directed
by
captain
king
and
others
to
the
singular
appearance
of
the
rocks
on
cape
melville
indeed
no
one
can
pass
this
remarkable
projection
without
being
struck
by
the
strange
manner
in
which
piles
of
stones
are
scattered
about
in
the
utmost
confusion
and
in
every
possible
direction
over
this
high
ridge
i
much
regretted
that
on
passing
next
morning
there
was
no
opportunity
of
landing
to
see
the
nature
of
this
confused
mass
judging
however
from
the
result
of
my
examination
of
a
similar
appearance
presented
by
depuch
island
on
the
coast
i
believe
this
point
to
be
of
volcanic
origin
cape
flinders
between
the
rocks
off
cape
melville
and
a
reef
encircling
two
small
islets
the
channel
is
not
more
than
a
mile
in
width
indeed
i
consider
passing
this
point
and
cape
flinders
the
most
intricate
part
of
the
inner
route
after
rounding
the
rocks
off
the
former
we
steered
for
the
latter
cape
keeping
it
a
little
on
the
port
bow
this
course
led
us
on
reef
a
lying
midway
between
the
cape
and
a
low
island
to
the
when
on
the
southern
extremity
cape
flinders
bore
south
degrees
west
miles
and
clack
island
north
degrees
west
the
latter
is
a
remarkable
cliffy
lump
interesting
from
the
circumstance
of
cunningham
having
found
native
drawings
in
its
caves
after
clearing
this
danger
and
passing
the
cape
we
steered
across
princess
charlotte
bay
keeping
wide
to
the
southward
of
the
reefs
fronting
it
in
order
that
we
might
the
more
easily
distinguish
them
the
sun
at
that
time
of
the
day
being
in
the
direction
of
the
ship
head
the
soundings
gradually
decreased
with
a
soft
muddy
bottom
as
we
approached
the
eastern
shores
of
the
bay
which
is
so
large
and
free
from
shoals
that
a
vessel
not
wishing
to
anchor
might
pass
the
night
standing
off
and
on
with
perfect
safety
there
is
over
the
head
of
this
bay
a
remarkable
hill
called
by
captain

rendered
the
more
conspicuous
from
the
low
nature
of
the
surrounding
country

in
the
evening
we
anchored
a
mile
from
the
side
of
a
small
detached
reef
marked
f
in
the
chart
and
distant
miles
from
cape
flinders
the
solitary
position
of
this
reef
it
being
four
miles
from
the
inner
edge
of
the
great
barrier
and
nine
from
the
nearest
part
of
the
main
gave
us
a
good
opportunity
of
making
a
section
with
a
view
of
illustrating
the
progressive
structure
of
coral
edifices
in
the
still
waters
within
the
barrier
reef
we
accordingly
visited
the
spot
in
the
evening
and
being
an
interesting
object
we
give
a
drawing
of
the
section
it
proved
a
good
specimen
of
the
circular
or
lagoon
reef
one
young
mangrove
was
growing
on
the
elevated
part
marked
c
in
the
woodcut
the
rim
which
rose
on
all
sides
was
quite
black
but
white
when
broken
the
highest
part
being
about
three
feet
above
the
water
the
nature
of
the
bottom
within
the
reef
was
a
white
sand
mixed
with
small
pieces
of
dead
coral
without
we
found
on
either
side
soft
green
sandy
mud
with
shells
the
inclination
of
the
bottom
on
which
the
reef
rests
being
only
one
degree
we
may
fairly
infer
it
to
be
superimposed
on
a
most
extensive
basis
claremont

july
being
sunday
we
did
not
proceed
further
than
number
of
the
claremont
isles
a
low
rocky
group
encircled
by
coral
reefs
to
give
the
ship
company
a
run
on

during
the
afternoon
in
order
to
remind
them
of
its
being
a
day
of
rest
appointed
by
the
lord
when
we
anchored
we
found
contrary
to
the
usual
tendency
of
the
current
a
tide
setting
three
quarters
of
a
knot
an
hour
this
lasted
for
a
space
of
four
hours
when
it
changed
and
ran
from
half
to
three
quarters
of
a
knot
during
the
remainder
of
our
stay
the
wind
was
moderate
from

we
weighed
at
and
about
the

hour
in
the
evening
again
anchored

the

during
the
day
followed
the
trend
of
the

keeping
about
seven
miles
from
it
except
when
opposite
cape
direction
where
we
were
about
half
that
distance
from
the
shore
we
found
little
to
add
to
captain
king
chart
with
the
exception
of
some
reefs
lying
about
ten
miles
east
from
the
headland
cordillera
the
coast
here
again
attained
a
moderate
height
and
a
round
hill
ten
miles
south
of
cape
direction
reached
the
height
of
feet
its
latitude
being
degrees
south
is
nearly
five
degrees
and
a
half
north
of
where
the
cordillera
is
feet
high
and
degrees
of
where
it
attains
its
greatest
elevation
that
of
feet
a
fact
which
will
at
once
demonstrate
the
northerly
tendency
in
the
dip
of
the
chain
of
hills
this
degree
is
further
illustrated
by
the
height
of
hill
in
degrees
minutes
south
being
only
feet
from
the
data
given
despite
the
limited
number
of
our
facts
it
will
be
seen
that
the
dip
becomes
gradually
more
rapid
as
you
advance
to
the
northward
from
cape
sidmouth
the
passage
was
much
contracted
by
a
covered
rock
in
the
very
centre
of
the

this
may
be
avoided
by
keeping
close
to
the

a
mile
off
its
side
there
is
also
a
remarkable
peak
on
the
shore
four
miles
to
the
southward
this
part
of
the

is
thus
rendered
very
conspicuous
from
seaward
and
may
be
discerned
outside
the
barrier

restoration
island
is
a
point
of
some
interest
from
having
been
first
visited
in
by
captain
bligh
during
his
extraordinary
and
unparalleled
voyage
in
the
bounty
launch
from
the
society

the
dangers
and
perils
undergone
by
this
undaunted
voyager
and
our
consciousness
of
the
joy
which
the
sight
of
land
must
have
brought
to
his
heart
gave
much
zest
to
our
feelings
with
regard
to
the
locality
there
is
always
an
interest
in
connection
with
scenes
associated
with
a
name
such
as
that
of
bligh
but
to
us
the
interest
was
double
it
was
the
sympathy
of
seamen
with
a
brother
sailor
misfortunes
restoration
island
as
captain
king
had
not
examined
this
interesting
spot
we
thought
his
chart
would
be
greatly
improved
by
our
passing
a
day
in
the
place
this
was
the
more
necessary
as
we
found
it
to
be
a
snug
anchorage
and
convenient
place
for
ships
passing
the
name
of
restoration
island
was
given
it
by
bligh
from
the
circumstance
of
his
having
made
it
upon
the
anniversary
of
the
recall
of
charles
ii
to
the
throne
of
england

the
surveying
operations
necessary
to
perfect
the

of

afforded
ample
employment
during

during

slightly
diversified
by
a

soon
after

we
were
again
on
our
passage
the
cloudy

enabling
us
to
make
out

connected
by

sir

the
cockburn
isles
are
also
conspicuous
objects
in
this
neighbourhood
particularly
the
former
which
is
visible
from
outside
the
barrier
and
thus
forms
a
leading
mark
for
ships
making
their
way
through
these
reefs
in
the
evening
the
anchor
was
dropped
about
a
mile
from
the
north
side
of
the
bird
isles
in
ten
fathoms
a
sudden
degree
from
fifteen
just
before
standing
in
to
the
anchorage
five
miles
by
east
from
these
isles
we
passed
close
to
the
position
of
a
patch
of
shoal
water
according
to
the
chart
its
presence
however
was
not
detected
the
depth
at
the
time
being
nineteen
fathoms
the
only
additions
made
to
the
chart
during
the
day
were
a
few
soundings
besides
increasing
the
number
and
altering
the
position
of
cockburn
islands
with
the
reefs
fronting
them
the
number
of
these
isles
is
thus
increased
from
two
to
four
they
are
square
rocky
lumps
the
largest
being
three
hundred
feet
high
the
current
during
the
day
set
steadily
almost
a
mile
an
hour
on
anchoring
we
found
it
setting
at
the
same
rate
at
midnight
it
changed
its
direction
to
from
a
quarter
to
half
a
knot
an
hour
the
time
of
being
about
it
is
evident
the
came
here
from
south
or
the
islands
passed
during
the
day
were
of
a
small
lagoon
character
and
the
reefs
with
an
elevated
patch
of
dead
coral
at
their
north
extreme
which
had
the
appearance
at
a
distance
of
sand
the
mainland
had
much
changed
in
outline
having
subsided
into
a
wearisome
series
of
undulating
hills
varying
from
five
to
seven
hundred
feet
in
height
the
coast
was
therefore
utterly
void
of
any
feature
of
interest
after
passing
fair
cape
july
at
daylight
we
were
again
underway
and
steered
north
by
east
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
if
there
were
any
reefs
to
the
eastward
of
u
and
when
number
of
a
group
next
south
of
cairncross
bore
north
degrees
west
four
and
a
half
miles
the
course
was
changed
to
to
pass
between
the
reef
fronting
its
south
side
and
reef
w
where
we
had
a
depth
of
fathoms
both
of
these
we
found
it
necessary
to
enlarge
on
the
chart
at
the
time
of
altering
the
course
the
ship
was
two
miles
from
the
position
of
an
island
according
to
chart
but
as
we
did
not
see
it
and
as
captain
king
has
not
laid
it
down
upon
his
own
authority
we
may
safely
conclude
that
it
either
does
not
exist
or
that
it
is
much
out
of
position
boydan
island
rounding
the
reef
off
its
south
extremity
we
anchored
in
fathoms
one
mile
south
degrees
west
from
the
centre
of
the
island
before
mentioned
number
of
the
group
south
of
cairncross
shortly
before
noon
this
captain
king
supposes
to
be
boydan
that
on
which
the
crew
of
the
charles
eaton
were
massacred
it
was
therefore
determined
that
the
remainder
of
the
day
should
be
spent
in
examining
the
place
with
a
view
to
ascertain
the
correctness
of
this
supposition
the
melancholy
interest
of
the
search
was
to
me
greatly
enhanced
from
having
seen
at
sydney
young
one
of
the
survivors
of
this
party
and
son
of
an
indian
officer
returning
from
furlough
being
an
infant
his
helplessness
excited
the
sympathies
of
an
indian
woman
who
snatched
him
from
the
arms
of
his
murdered
mother
and
sheltered
him
within
her
own
nor
did
her
kindness
stop
here
the
maternal
solicitude
of
the
sex
inducing
her
to
protect
and
console
the
child
examination
of
boydan
island
we
had
just
read
captain
king
interesting
pamphlet
in
relation
to
this
sad
event
detailing
with
minuteness
all
the
circumstances
of
the
tragedy
and
with
our
minds
so
recently
imbued
with
the
horrors
it
inspired
naturally
advanced
to
the
search
with
zeal
and
activity
anxious
if
possible
to
place
the
locality
of
its
occurrence
beyond
a
doubt
the
isle
was
easily
traversed
being
of
small
extent
not
more
indeed
than
a
mile
in
circumference
we
crossed
it
accordingly
in
every
direction
and
discovered
the
remains
of
native
fires
near
which
great
quantities
of
turtle
bones
and
some
coconut
shells
were
scattered
about
it
was
remarkable
that
wherever
boughs
were
cut
an
axe
or
some
other
sharp
instrument
had
been
used
a
topmast
with
the
lower
cap
attached
to
it
was
found
on
the
side
of
the
island
which
we
afterwards
discovered
to
be
a
portion
of
the
brig
william
wrecked
on
the
outer
barrier
three
months
before
captain
king
drew
his
conclusions
relative
to
this
island
from
the
circumstance
of
young
ireland
stating
that
on
their
way
to
it
in
the
canoe
after
leaving
the
raft
they
first
passed
three
islands
on
the
right
northward
and
one
on
the
left
southward
correct
chart
from
the
bearings
however
and
from
our
run
on
the
following
morning
we
found
it
necessary
to
correct
the
chart
thus
decreasing
the
number
of
islands
we
found
that
marked
to
have
no
existence
and
far
too
much
to
the
westward
while
and
were
placed
to
the
eastward
of
their
true
position
these
errors
occasionally
occur
where
they
are
numerous
much
alike
and
are
passed
quickly
the
change
in
the
number
and
position
of
the
islands
is
in
some
measure
hostile
to
the
views
of
captain
king
and
i
am
further
inclined
from
these
corrections
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
number
of
the
group
is
boydan
island
a
name
given
by
the
murray
islanders
to
the
spot
rendered
notorious
by
the
massacre
we
have
already
alluded
to
and
which
will
be
described
more
in
detail
in
captain
stanley
highly
interesting
narrative
further
on
in
the
present
work
on
examining
the
reef
fronting
the
island
which
is
a
more
perfect
specimen
of
a
lagoon
than
any
we
had
yet
seen
we
found
that
the
outer
edge
consisted
of
a
wall
higher
than
any
of
the
parts
within
rising
at
to
an
elevation
of
ten
feet
while
inside
pools
or
holes
existed
three
or
four
feet
deep
containing
live
coral
sponges
and
trepang
scattered
about
on
different
parts
of
the
reef
were
many
chama
gigas
not
however
so
large
as
those
i
had
formerly
seen
at
keeling
or
cocos
islands
in
the
indian
ocean
weighing
pounds
singular
to
say
at
i
observed
the
latitude
by
a
meridian
altitude
of
venus
although
a
bright
sunny
day
the
result
agreed
with
captain
king
chart
placing
the
centre
of
the
island
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
tidal
observations
we
experienced
more
tide
here
than
at
any
anchorage
we
had
yet
occupied
during
the
passage
from
to
it
set
half
an
knot
an
hour
to
the
southward
then
changed
to
by
north
increasing
its
rate
to
one
knot
by
and
decreasing
it
to
a
quarter
of
a
knot
by
when
it
again
set
to
the
the
stream
thus
appears
to
set
nine
hours
by
north
and
three
the
short
duration
of
the
latter
which
is
the
ebb
is
caused
by
the
northerly
direction
of
the
prevailing
current
this
also
was
the
only
spot
where
our
fishermen
had
any
success
in
a
few
hours
several
dozen
of
a
species
of
small
red
bream
being
caught
three
or
four
ships
passing
together
would
find
a
secure
berth
about
two
miles
of
where
the
beagle
anchored
where
the
depth
is
moderate
with
good
holding
ground
it
has
great
advantage
in
this
particular
over
cairncross
where
but
one
vessel
could
lie
snug
and
still
greater
over
turtle
island
more
exposed
even
than
the
former
with
a
strong
tide
and
where
vessels
ride
very
uneasily
moreover
the
supposed
boydan
or
number
isle
can
be
left
a
full
hour
before
daylight
there
being
nothing
in
the
way
to
impede
a
ship
progress
for
some
miles
those
who
are
not
desirous
of
passing
the
reefs
off
wednesday
and
hammond
islands
late
in
the
day
with
the
sun
in
an
unfavourable
position
can
find
a
convenient
stopping
place
in
blackwood
bay
under
the
largest
york
isle
or
under
the
cape
of
that
name
cairncross
island
july
we
left
at
an
early
hour
steering
west
for
cairncross
island
which
we
passed
at
a
distance
of
half
a
mile
from
the
eastern
side
in
fathoms
its
height
is
feet
to
the
tops
of
the
trees
which
according
to
bynoe
who
subsequently
visited
it
in
the
month
of
september
are
dwarf
gums
the
of
the
colonists
is
also
found
here
in
addition
to
some
small
bushes
this
island
is
the
resort
of
a
large
bright
pigeon
carpophaga
leucomela
the
ends
of
the
wings
being
tipped
with
black
or
very
dark
blue
bynoe
found
the
island
quite
alive
with
them
flocks
of
about
twenty
or
thirty
flying
continually
to
and
from
the
main
they
not
only
resort
but
breed
there
as
he
found
several
old
nests
as
this
bird
was
not
met
with
in
the
beagle
on
the
western
coast
we
may
fairly
conclude
it
only
inhabits
the
eastern
and
northern
the
furthest
south
it
was
seen
by
the
officers
of
britomart
was
latitude
degrees
in
addition
to
these
bynoe
saw
the
holes
of
some
small
burrowing
animals
which
are
doubtless
rats
on
a
sandy
spit
close
to
the
bushes
or
scrub
he
saw
a
native
encampment
of
a
semicircular
form
enclosing
an
area
of
about
ten
yards
the
occupants
had
but
recently
left
it
as
a
fire
was
found
burning
and
the
impression
of
their
feet
still
fresh
in
the
sand
it
appears
that
at
this
season
of
the
year
being
the
favourable
monsoon
for
ships
passing
through
the
barrier
reefs
on
their
voyage
to
india
the
islands
to
the
southward
are
much
frequented
by
the
natives
of
murray
and
others
of
the
northern
isles
waiting
like
wreckers
of
old
the
untoward
loss
of
some
ship
when
their
canoes
appear
as
if
by
magic
hastening
to
the
doomed
vessel
just
as
in
the
pampas
of
south
america
no
sooner
has
the
sportsman
brought
down
a
deer
than
the
air
is
filled
with
myriads
of
vultures
winging
their
way
towards
the
carcass
though
a
few
minutes
before
not
a
feather
was
stirring
the
of
these
indians
resembles
that
of
the
carrion
bird
itself
while
their
rapacity
and
recklessness
of
blood
is
fully
equal
to
that
of
the
lower
animal
as
some
of
our
readers
may
imagine
that
vultures
and
birds
of
prey
are
attracted
to
the
carcasses
of
animals
by
smell
i
may
state
that
an
experiment
was
tried
with
a
condor
in
south
america
being
hoodwinked
he
passed
unnoticed
a
large
piece
of
beef
but
as
soon
as
the
bandage
was
removed
he
rushed
eagerly
towards
and
devoured
it
hill
we
left
our
readers
at
cairncross
island
and
now
return
to
our
narrative
by
describing
the
neighbouring
coast
the
most
remarkable
feature
on
this
part
of
the
mainland
generally
speaking
a
dull
monotonous
level
is
a
hill
bearing
over
the
extremity
of
the
reef
fronting
the
south
side
of
cairncross
south
degrees
west
to
which
captain
bligh
has
given
the
quaint
name
of
hill
it
received
this
appellation
from
a
resemblance
to
an
inverted
pudding
dish
commonly
used
by
sailors
and
is
feet
high
the
coast
about
ten
miles
to
the
northward
projects
a
mile
and
a
half
further
eastward
than
is
marked
in
the
chart
this
error
did
not
however
appear
to
be
so
great
south
of
escape
river
where
the
character
of
the
coast
is
low
and
cliffy
separated
by
small
sandy
bays
instead
of
a
continued
line
of
cliffs
as
at
present
represented
escape
river
at
noon
we
were
in
the
parallel
of
the
south
point
of
escape
river
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
observations
and
bearings
both
agreeing
this
river
receives
its
name
in
record
of
one
of
those
narrow
escapes
to
which
surveying
vessels
are
subject
captain
king
having
been
nearly
wrecked
in
the
mermaid
attempting
to
enter
the
river
he
found
it
not
to
be
navigable
a
reef
extending
across
its
mouth
on
which
his
vessel
struck
very
heavily
correct
position
of
reefs
avoiding
captain
king
track
we
passed
to
the
eastward
of
reef
x
being
thus
afforded
a
better
opportunity
of
determining
its
position
than
he
had
this
we
did
by
transit
bearings
with
different
points
which
placed
it
nearly
two
miles
south
by
east
of
the
spot
assigned
it
on
the
charts
on
mentioning
this
afterwards
to
captain
king
he
told
me
his
survey
of
that
part
of
the
coast
had
never
given
him
satisfaction
for
there
the
monsoon
blows
fresh
and
his
small
vessel
was
hurried
past
without
his
being
able
to
land
in
search
of
better
data
for
the
chart
the
reader
must
not
from
these
corrections
few
when
we
consider
the
extent
of
the
survey
be
led
to
imagine
that
our
object
is
to
pick
out
errors
in
the
surveys
of
others
but
from
being
in
a
larger
and
better
appointed
vessel
our
opportunities
of
examination
were
necessarily
greater
than
those
afforded
to
captain
king
who
was
always
most
anxious
to
detect
errors
in
his
own
charts
without
dwelling
on
the
fact
that
the
result
of
our
examination
afforded
us
the
satisfaction
of
restoring
parts
of
the
chart
before
erroneously
corrected
to
his
original
construction
we
would
venture
to
hope
that
while
desirous
as
much
as
possible
to
perfect
our
knowledge
of
the
coast
we
were
in
no
manner
actuated
by
that
spirit
of
so
pithily
described
by
liebeg
when
he
says
that
it
is
startling
to
reflect
that
all
the
time
and
energy
of
a
multitude
of
persons
of
genius
talent
and
knowledge
is
expended
in
endeavours
to
demonstrate
each
others
errors
this
error
we
found
to
extend
also
to
reefs
y
and
x
is
one
of
the
reefs
with
the
singular
white
patch
of
dead
coral
on
its
northern
extremity
which
i
have
before
spoken
of
z
is
similarly
marked
and
dries
at
last
quarter
ebb
while
the
part
of
y
is
never
covered
a
few
mangroves
growing
on
it
when
abreast
of
x
we
saw
from
deck
the
curious
hill
on
the
largest
york
island
mount
adolphus
and
when
over
the
centre
of
reef
z
it
bore
north
degrees
west
we
now
steered
to
the
westward
between
reefs
x
and
y
and
afterwards
for
mount
adolphus
between
the
brothers
and
albany
islands
the
depth
was
fathoms
these
are
both
black
rocky
lumps
particularly
the
latter
the
outer
being
a
mere
pointed
rock
altogether
they
assume
a
sterile
and
dreary
appearance
in
excellent
keeping
with
the
inhospitable
character
of
the
adjoining
coast
several
shoals
and
much
shoal
water
were
noticed
in
newcastle
bay
blackwood
bay
at
we
anchored
in
blackwood
bay
in
a
depth
of
fathoms
point
dicky
bearing
south
half
a
mile
and
mount
adolphus
in
the
evening
a
plan
was
made
of
this
very
convenient
stopping
place
for
ships
and
all
the
angles
taken
to
the
extremity
of
the
group
place
them
a
mile
and
a
half
to
the
eastward
of
their
position
in
the
chart
observations
were
also
obtained
near
point
dicky
which
we
found
to
be
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
and
longitude
degrees
minutes
east
of
port
essington
the
extremity
of
the
singular
hill
being
minute
seconds
north
and
seconds
east
of
this
spot
the
first
question
interesting
to
ships
is
the
supply
of
wood
and
water
the
latter
we
had
no
time
to
look
for
but
of
the
former
there
was
an
abundance
though
from
the
shore
being
fronted
by
extensive
coral
flats
it
is
difficult
to
be
attained
the
appearance
of
the
island
is
similar
to
that
of
the
albany
cluster
it
having
the
same
rocky
bleak
and
almost
wild
look
from
which
i
conclude
they
are
of
the
same
formation
which
in
general
terms
we
may
call
porphyritic
parts
of
the
island
appeared
to
be
intersected
by
a
growth
of
mangroves
there
appeared
great
irregularity
in
the
tides
at
this
anchorage
as
if
there
were
a
meeting
of
various
streams
at
it
was
setting
about
an
hour
and
continued
to
run
in
that
direction
until
hours
minutes
gradually
decreasing
its
rate
it
then
took
a
north
and
by
east
direction
with
the
same
velocity
until
half
an
hour
after
midnight
when
it
again
changed
back
to
a
course
it
pursued
during
the
remainder
of
our
stay
by
the
rise
of
the
water
on
the
shore
it
would
appear
that
the
flood
came
from
the
westward
torres
strait
on
reaching
york
island
we
considered
ourselves
within
the
strait
which
took
its
name
from
the
spanish
navigator
torres
who
sailed
in
second
in
command
under
pedro
fernandes
de
quiros
from
callao
in
peru
with
the
object
of
discovering
the
tierra
austral
then
supposed
to
be
a
continent
occupying
a
considerable
portion
of
the
southern
hemisphere
lying
westward
of
america
torres
passed
through
this
strait
in
but
despite
the
great
importance
of
the
discovery
its
existence
remained
unknown
until
from
the
jealousy
of
the
spanish
monarchy
which
kept
the
reports
of
its
navigators
a
secret
from
the
world
at
the
time
in
question
however
manila
fell
into
our
hands
and
in
the
archives
of
that
colony
a
duplicate
copy
of
torres
letter
to
the
king
of
spain
was
found
by
the
hydrographer
dalrymple
the
passage
was
now
made
known
and
in
tardy
justice
to
the
discoverer
it
received
the
appellation
of
torres
strait
a
tribute
to
the
reputation
of
man
the
greatest
perhaps
which
could
be
bestowed
since
no
more
sure
road
to
immortality
can
be
pointed
out
than
giving
a
name
to
the
great
and
imperishable
works
of
the
creator
hand
it
was
not
however
until
that
the
world
received
full
confirmation
of
this
great
acquisition
to
our
geographical
knowledge
the
immortal
cook
then
passing
through
and
settling
the
question
of
its
existence
this
being
the
high
road
between
our
growing
eastern
and
australian
possessions
the
reader
will
at
once
see
the
importance
which
must
ever
attach
to
the
discovery
and
will
the
more
readily
comprehend
our
enlarging
in
some
degree
upon
the
circumstance
july
there
had
been
noticed
last
evening
a
slight
rippling
outside
the
bay
and
on
leaving
this
morning
we
found
it
to
be
a
ridge
about
two
cables
width
the
least
water
on
it
being
three
fathoms
from
the
shoalest
part
mount
adolphus
bore
north
degrees
east
and
point
dicky
south
degrees
east
it
appeared
by
the
ripples
continuing
towards
the
of
york
island
that
this
rocky
ledge
extended
in
that
direction
vessels
entering
blackwood
bay
may
always
avoid
this
shoal
by
keeping
close
to
point
dicky
or
by
steering
for
mount
adolphus
when
it
bears
north
being
desirous
to
know
if
there
were
a
practicable
channel
through
endeavour
strait
by
which
the
inconvenience
before
alluded
to
of
passing
the
reef
fronting
hammond
island
late
in
the
afternoon
might
be
avoided
we
proceeded
in
that
direction
passing
along
the
extreme
of
the
continent
and
between
the
possession
islands
we
entered
endeavour
strait
this
termination
of
the
shores
of
australia
being
level
and
of
moderate
elevation
presents
nothing
remarkable
save
a
peak
over
cape
york
and
fronting
the
possession
isles
cook
island
it
has
an
inhospitable
appearance
being
apparently
similar
in
formation
with
york
isles
and
subsides
rapidly
to
the
forming
the
south
side
of
endeavour
strait
where
it
scarcely
reaches
an
elevation
of
fifty
feet
contrasting
forcibly
with
the
high
rocky
land
of
the
opposite
side
of
the
strait
formed
by
the
largest
of
the
prince
of
wales
islands
upon
which
former
navigators
not
having
bestowed
a
name
we
conferred
that
of
the
immortal
navigator
not
but
that
the
strait
known
by
the
name
of
his
ship
is
quite
sufficient
to
recall
the
mind
of
posterity
to
his
perils
and
dangers
in
these
seas
but
that
we
his
humble
followers
in
the
great
cause
of
discovery
might
add
our
mite
to
the
wreath
of
glory
which
must
ever
encircle
the
name
of
captain
cook
on
the
extremity
of
this
island
is
a
remarkable
peak
in
the
shape
of
a
horn
called
by
him
horn
hill
captain
king
having
only
passed
between
the
eastern
of
the
possession
isles
little
was
known
of
the
western
shores
a
few
angles
and
bearings
were
accordingly
taken
as
we
passed
between
them
to
assist
in
remedying
this
deficiency
endeavour
strait
there
was
no
impediment
to
our
passage
through
the
strait
until
we
got
abreast
of
wallis
isles
cape
cornwall
bearing
east
by
north
north
when
the
water
shoaled
to
four
fathoms
and
a
half
finding
by
hauling
up
on
either
tack
that
we
were
on
a
ridge
extending
from
the
cape
we
ran
to
the
westward
until
we
could
cross
it
which
we
did
in
three
and
a
half
fathoms
north
wallis
island
bearing
five
miles
booby
island
i
saw
at
the
time
from
the
masthead
a
blue
streak
of
water
to
the
southward
still
affording
hopes
of
there
being
a
deep
outlet
to
endeavour
strait
but
as
the
day
was
far
advanced
with
a
fresh
breeze
from
it
was
not
deemed
prudent
to
get
the
ship
entangled
in
shoal
water
therefore
after
crossing
the
ridge
extending
off
cape
cornwall
we
steered
west
for
booby
island
in
regular
soundings
of
six
and
seven
fathoms
and
late
in
the
afternoon
anchored
nearly
a
mile
from
its
western
side
a
flagstaff
bearing
south
degrees
east
this
we
found
on
landing
had
been
erected
in
by
captain
hobson
of
rattlesnake
who
at
the
same
time
placed
in
a
large
box
made
for
the
purpose
a
book
with
printed
forms
which
every
ship
passing
filled
up
with
the
addition
of
such
remarks
as
were
thought
of
consequence
over
this
box
in
large
letters
were
painted
the
words
post
office
a
name
by
which
booby
island
must
be
quite
familiar
to
all
who
have
navigated
these
seas
ships
being
here
in
the
habit
of
leaving

a
similar
practice
prevailing
among
the

at
the
galapagos
islands
in
the
pacific
we
are
indebted
for
the
book
to
the
public
spiritedness
of
an
indian
army
officer
the
beneficial
results
of
the
plan
were
experienced
by
ourselves
as
here
we
first
heard
of
the
port
essington
expedition
having
passed
eight
months
previously
also
of
the
schooner
essington
that
left
sydney
in
advance
of
the
expedition
for
that
place
having
succeeded
in
determining
the
fact
of
the
of
the
other
young
one
of
the
passengers
of
the
charles
eaton
this
result
of
the
enterprising
researches
fully
bears
out
the
fact
mentioned
by
captain
king
on
the
authority
of
the
darnley
islanders
that
he
shared
the
fate
of
his
parents
being
devoured
by
their
savage
captors
all
the
ships
which
have
recorded
their
passage
in
the
book
appeared
to
have
entered
the
barrier
between
the
latitude
of
degrees
minutes
and
degrees
minutes
generally
about
degrees
minutes
reaching
sir
charles
hardy
island
the
same
day
they
all
spoke
of
a
strong
northerly
current
outside
the
reef
in
some
instances
of
nearly
three
knots
the
time
occupied
in
making
the
passage
from
sydney
by
the
outer
route
varied
from
fourteen
to
twenty
days
it
being
certainly
shorter
than
the
inner
though
attended
with
much
greater
risks
one
objection
made
against
the
latter
is
the
necessity
of
anchoring
every
evening
somewhat
laborious
work
to
the
crews
of
merchant
ships
this
might
be
obviated
in
some
measure
by
using
a
light
anchor
which
could
be
done
with
perfect
safety
in
the
still
waters
within
the
reefs
we
found
two
barques
at
anchor
which
had
arrived
on
the
preceding
day
in
accordance
with
a
practice
very
generally
observed
they
were
giving
themselves
a
short
period
of
repose
and
relaxation
after
the
anxieties
and
danger
of
the
outer
passage
which
short
as
it
is

doubtless
sprinkled

booby

is
a
mere

from
the
various
associations
connected
with
it
being
during
one
half
of
the
year
the
constant
resort
of
europeans
it
becomes
at
once
a
place
of
interest
and
imperatively
demands
some
notice
at
our
hands
it
is
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
diameter
flat
and
about
thirty
feet
high
the
summit
being
bare

a
valley
intersects
the
side
of

island
in
which
a
few
creepers
some
brushwood
and
two

three
trees
of
tolerable
size
with
a
peculiar
broad
green
leaf
bearing
a
great
resemblance
to
that
of
the
wild
almond
of
the
west
indies
were
seen
giving
shelter
to
some
pigeons
and
quails
in
which
latter
the
island
abounds
even
more
than
in
the
bird
which
gives
its
name
to
the
locality
still
however
from
the
white
colour
of
the
top
of
the
island
produced
by
the
boobies
it
is
clearly
one
of
their
temporary
haunts
and
indeed
subsequently
in
the
month
of
september
their
season
of
incubation
bynoe
saw
them
there
in
great
abundance
the
contrary
was
the
case
with
the
quail
which
by
that
time
had
completely
deserted

once
found
on
this
isle

this
being
a
point
at
which
ships
correct
or
test
the
going
of
their
chronometers
it
was
necessary
to
obtain
observations
for
longitude
the
spot
chosen
for
the
purpose
was
the
near
the
corner
of
the
islet
and
which
we
found
to
be

minutes
east
of

essington
our
opportunities
of
examination
with
regard
to
the
inner
edge
of
the
great
barrier
and
its
contiguous
islands
and
reefs
terminating
at
booby
island
it
may
not
be
deemed
irrelevant
to
hazard
a
few
remarks
in
recapitulation
in
the
first
place
there
was
a
very
perceptible
increase
in
the
elevation
of
the
reefs
and
of
those
islands
resting
on
similar
constructions
as
we
advanced
to
the
northward
cairncross
island
in
latitude
degrees
south
composed
of
heaped
up
consolidated
fragments
attains
an
elevation
of
feet
but
its
trees
rise
to
a
height
of
feet
whilst
to
the
southward
in
latitude
degrees
south
the
islands
were
partially
flooded
by
a
tide
rising
only
about
six
feet
the
reefs
are
all
either
circular
or
with
a
rim
rising
round
them
the
description
of
that
fronting
the
isle
we
visited
for
boydan
will
illustrate
their
general
character
their
northern
ends
are
the
highest
and
are
almost
invariably
marked
by
a
heap
of
dead
coral
and
shells
which
as
we
have
mentioned
in
one
or
two
instances
from
its
white
appearance
has
often
been
taken
for
sand
the
remarkable
breaks
in
this
singularly
great
extent
of
coral
reefs
known
as
the
barrier
of
australia
being
in
direction
varying
from
west
to
generally
speaking
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
upheaval
by
which
the
base
of
this
huge
coral
building
was
formed
partakes
of
the
general
direction
in
which
a
large
portion
of
the
eastern
world
apparently
emerged
from
the
water
a
glance
at
the
map
of
that
portion
of
the
globe
will
strengthen
this
hypothesis
placing
as
it
does
this
singular
fact
at
once
before
the
reader
mind
starting
with
the
stupendous
heights
of
the
himalaya
mountains
and
proceeding
thence
to
several
groups
of
the
polynesian
islands
new
caledonia
and
others
this
remarkable
similarity
in
the
trend
of
these
portions
of
the
earth
is
plainly
distinguishable
it
would
appear
therefore
from
the
general
tendency
of
these
upheavals
that
the
cavernous
hollows
beneath
the
crust
of
the
earth
within
whose
bosom
originated
these
remarkable
convulsions
have
a
strong
inclination
in
one
direction
a
circumstance
in
connection
with
the
earth
history
of
great
and
curious
interest
with
this
general
statement
of
facts
which
we
note
for
the
benefit
of
scientific
men
and
in
illustration
of
the
singular
changes
which
are
taking
place
on
the
surface
of
the
globe
we
return
to
our
narrative
from
which
we
have
wandered
at
some
considerable
length
as
the
duration
of
our
cruise
on
the
and
most
interesting
portions
of
the
coast
depended
in
a
great
measure
on
the
supply
of
provisions
to
be
obtained
at
port
essington
we
were
naturally
anxious
to
satisfy
ourselves
upon
the
point
and
accordingly
spent
but
a
few
hours
at
booby
island
taking
our
departure
at
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
proceed
to
port
essington
proceeding
towards
port
essington
we
experienced
a
constant
current
setting
between
and
west
from
half
to
three
quarters
of
a
knot
an
hour
except
when
crossing
the
mouth
of
the
gulf
of
carpentaria
when
from
the
indraught
its
direction
was
changed
to
the

were
as
captain
king
has
described
them
veering
from
in
the
morning
to
east
in
the
evening
and
blowing
fresh
towards
the
middle
of
the
day
beyond
this
nothing
occurred
worthy
of
remark
until
the
morning
of
the
when
soon
after
daylight
we
found
ourselves
steering
rather
within
a
large
patch
of
discoloured
water
extending
off
cape
croker
the
extreme
of
the
coburg
peninsula
a
low
point
with
a
slight
hummock
on
it
on
the
north
side
of
this
peninsula
is
situated

thirty
miles
to
the
westward
of
the
cape

the
water
off
the
latter
we
knew
indicated
the
reef
discovered
by
the
brig
tigris
belonging
to
the
indian
navy
which
in
company
with
the
new
south
wales
colonial
schooner
isabella
was
returning
from
rescuing
the
survivors
of
the
charles
eaton
from
the
natives
of
murray
island
when
half
a
mile
from
the
side
in
fathoms
rocky

cape
croker
bearing
south
degrees
east
six
miles
we
steered
out
keeping
at
the
same
distance
round
this
patch
of
light
water
in
twenty
and
fathoms
seven
or
eight
miles
from
the
cape
which
bore
when
over
what
appeared
the
shoalest
part
south
degrees
east
this
conclusion
i
afterwards
found
on
meeting
captain
stanley
to
be
correct
as
that
bearing
led
over
the
part
of
the
reef
he
struck
on
in
britomart
but
being
on
the
inner
part
he
was
distant
only
three
miles
from
cape
croker
whilst
the
outer
edge
of
the
reef
i
believe
to
be
seven
miles
from
it
on
the
same
bearing
in
hauling
up
to
the
southward
round
the
extreme
of
the
discoloured
water
the
soundings
were
as
follows
and
fathoms
with
rocky
bottom
the
cape
bore
when
in
the
least
depth

we
were
fortunate
in
having
such
good
means
of
determining
the
longitude
of
cape
croker
by
observation
of
a
twilight
star
when
in
the

and

with
the

soon
afterwards
these
both
agreeing
place
the
cape
miles
east
of
port
essington
instead
of
as
it
is
laid
down
in
the
chart
this
discovery
is
of
vital
importance
to
ships
proceeding
to
port
essington
we
were
therefore
glad
of
so
good
an
opportunity
for
rectifying
the
error
port
essington
expectation
was
on
as
we
were
fast
approaching
port
essington
feeling
naturally
anxious
to
see
what
progress
had
been
made
at
the
new
settlement
and
to
learn
the
fate
of
the
expedition
there
was
however
nothing
striking
in
the
first
appearance
of
the
land
a
low
woody
shore
the
most
remarkable
object
being
a
sandy
islet
with
a

in
its
centre

a

east

vashon

as
we
drew
near

boat
came
alongside
belonging
to

from
pascoe
we
heard
that
the
alligator
had
just
sailed
for
sydney
leaving
the
former
to
await
her
return
at
port
essington
the
people
forming
the
settlement
had
been
very
healthy
bearing
out
account
of
raffles
bay
and
had
found
the
natives
exceedingly
well
disposed
for
this
advantage
we
are
indebted
to
the
excellent
judgment
displayed
by
the
captain
barker
late
commandant
of
raffles
bay
he
having
during
his
stay
in
that
place
treated
them
with
kindness
to
which
they
were
fairly
entitled
from
men
so
far
their
superiors
in
knowledge
and
power
and
who
were
moreover
intruders
upon
their
soil
had
this
noble
conduct
of
captain
barker
been
more
universally
accepted
as
an
example
the
results
would
we
doubt
not
have
been
equally
satisfactory
elsewhere
this
expression
may
to
some
of
our
readers
require
explanation
and
we
therefore
quote
a
brief
extract
from

it

a

well
worthy

the
capital
of

destined
doubtless
from
its
proximity
to

our
other
eastern

to
become
not
only
a
great
commercial

a
valuable
naval
post
in

many
circumstances
combine
to
render
it
a
desirable
station
its
great
size
having
an
extent
sufficient
to

is
in
itself
of
vast
importance
while
as
a

the
side
the
inner
harbour
is
proportionably
decreased
in
size
from
the
extreme
of
this
cliffy
point
called
by
captain
king
from
its
position
middle

a
narrow
bank
extends
some
distance
in
the
direction
of

forming
the
only
danger

of
the

for
the

from
its
outer
edge

record
bears

and
the
part
of

degrees

these
and
other
bearings
recently
given
will
perhaps
be
considered
of
little
value
by
the
general
reader
but
as
they
were
required
to
take
the
beagle
into
port
essington
they
will
be
found
useful
to
others
for
the
same
purpose
appearance
of
the
settlement
the
narrow
entrance
to
the
inner
harbour
may
by
some
be
considered
a
drawback
but
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
what
is
an
impediment
to
navigation
is
also
a
safeguard
against
attack
moreover
from
this
want
of
breadth
in
the
harbour
a
fort
on
point
record
which
is
commanded
by
no
height
would
perfectly
protect
it
it
was
from
this
confined
portion
that
our
anxious
desire
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
new
settlement
was
at
length
gratified
and
we
were
somewhat
surprised
considering
the
recent
date
of
its
formation
to
discover
the
presence
of
so
many
buildings
as
were
scattered
over
the
top
of
a
cliffy
point
on
the
part
of
the
harbour
called
adam
head
at
the
base
of
which
was
a
long
jetty
clearing
the
bank
off
spear
point
we
ran
up
and
anchored
near
britomart
lying
off
the
settlement
early
in
the
afternoon
the
sight
of
another
vessel
is
ever
cheering
to
the
hearts
of
those
who
have
been
as
it
were
for
a
time
cut
off
from
the
world
nor
was
our
arrival
bringing
as
we
did
news
and
letters
any
less
welcome
though
after
a
long
interval
the
receipt
of
a
letter
perhaps
bearing
an
ill
omen
in
the
very
colour
of
its
wax
is
very
far
from
generating
unmixed
emotions
of
pleasure
so
much
may
occur
in
the
brief
space
of
a
few
months
that
a
seal
must
ever
be
broken
with
feelings
of
great
anxiety
i
well
remember
the
sensations
i
experienced
on
first
seeing
a
sail
after
an
interval
of
nine
months
and
that
wholly
spent
on
the
shores
of
tierra
del
fuego
port
essington
we
too
had
our
share
of
news
to
be
made
acquainted
with
captain
stanley
had
been
on
a
most
interesting
cruise
to
the
arru
islands
the
deeply
interesting
narrative
of
which
expedition
the
reader
will
peruse
we
are
sure
with
unqualified
satisfaction
in
a
later
section
of
the
present
work
this
meeting
gave
me
real
pleasure
though
with
regret
i
saw
that
he
had
been
much
harassed
lieutenant
stewart
of
the
alligator
had
also
made
a
journey
over
the
peninsula
to
which
i
shall
presently
further
allude
since
promoted
for
services
in
china
he
also
served
in
the
beagle
during
her
last
expedition
we
were
of
course
extremely
anxious
to
visit
the
settlement
landing
at
the
jetty
which
we
found
a
very
creditable
piece
of
workmanship
erected
under
the
direction
of
lieutenant
stewart
we
ascended
the
cliff
and
on
gaining
the
summit
found
ourselves
on
a
small
piece
of
tableland
partially
cleared
seen
through
the
trees
the
dwellings
of
the
settlers
had
an
air
of
neatness
pleasing
to
the
eye
among
the
other
buildings
in
progress
was
the
church
which
planted
as
it
was
on
the
northern
shores
of
the
australian
continent
was
expected
to
form
a
nucleus
from
which
offshoots
might
by
degrees
draw
within
its
influence
the
islands
in
the
arafura
sea
and
thus
widely
spread
the
pure
blessings
of
christianity
it
is
highly
characteristic
of
our
countrymen
that
where
with
other
nations
the
tavern
the
theatre
the
are
among
the
earliest
buildings
in
a
new
settlement
with
us
everywhere
the
church
is
first
thought
of
in
few
corners
of
the
world
where
english
influence
has
extended
itself
is
this
otherwise
than
true
and
it
is
a
highly
enviable
distinction
it
seems
indeed
that
wherever
the
flag
of
britain
floats
there
is
made
known
the
word
of
god
in
its
purity
and
as
an
empire
has
been
vouchsafed
us
on
which
the
sun
never
sets
the
extent
of
our
influence
for
good
in
this
respect
is
incalculable
we
may
venture
to
express
our
sincere
hope
that
our
country
will
ever
continue
to
enjoy
this
noble
supremacy
at
the
extremity
of
the
settlement
raised
on
piles
was
the
fronted
on
the
harbour
side
by
a
small
battery
behind
the
the
land
producing
very
coarse
grass
falls
away
to
the
and
some
clear
patches
which
from
lying
in
a
low
situation
are
flooded
during
the
rains
form
tolerable
soil
generally
speaking
however
there
is
a
great
deficiency
of
land
fit
for
cultivation
on
some
of
the
best
spots
lying
to
the
southward
and
westward
gardens
have
been
commenced
with
some
success
before
proceeding
further
with
our
journal
of
events
at
port
essington
it
may
be
proper
to
introduce
some
brief
account
of
the
state
and
prospects
of
the
settlement
at
that
place
the
reader
will
remember
an
allusion
in
a
previous
chapter
to
the
departure
from
sydney
of
the
expedition
despatched
for
the
purpose
of
forming
it
as
well
as
some
remarks
on
the
policy
of
giving
it
a
purely
military
character
that
expedition
reached
its
destination
on
october
having
taken
formal
possession
on
the
way
of
cape
york
and
the
adjacent
territory
sir
gordon
bremer
first
care
was
to
select
a
site
for
the
proposed
township
and
after
due
deliberation
a
spot
was
fixed
on
which
was
thought
to
combine
all
desirable
advantages
as
good
soil
the
neighbourhood
of
fresh
water
and
easy
approach
from
the
ships
in
port
in
the
selection
of
the
spot
to
be
occupied
by
a
settlement
the
capabilities
of
the
soil
must
ever
be
the
first
consideration
still
however
there
will
always
exist
an
objection
on
the
ground
of
its
great
distance
of
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
a
similar
disadvantage
in
the
falkland
islands
proved
of
great
detriment
to
the
settlement
in
berkeley
sound
the
site
of
victoria
for
such
was
the
name
bestowed
in
honour
of
her
majesty
on
the
new
settlement
is
raised
in
the
loftiest
part
about
fifty
feet
above
level
upon
it
the
plans
of
a
number
of
cottages
and
gardens
were
rapidly
marked
out
and
it
was
not
long
before
this
hitherto
desolate
spot
presented
the
appearance
of
a
large
straggling
village
a
pier
was
speedily
run
out
into
the
sea
and
a
good
road
cut
to
it
the
church
also
which
i
have
before
mentioned
was
soon
to
be
distinguished
rising
above
the
government
cottage
and
quarters
while
in
order
to
ensure
an
ample
supply
of
water
deep
wells
were
sunk
on
the
tableland
within
the
settlement
which
fully
answered
expectation
the
water
proving
good
and
abundant
not
long
after
the
arrival
of
the
expedition
dumont
with
the
astrolabe
and
zelie
arrived
in
raffles
bay
and
it
was
popularly
believed
that
they
had
entertained
some
intentions
of
forestalling
our
settlement
at
any
rate
the
question
whether
foreign
powers
were
entitled
to
take
possession
of
points
on
the
coast
of
australia
was
much
debated
at
the
time
however
this
may
be
and
with
whatever
feelings
the
respective
governments
of
france
and
england
may
have
regarded
each
other
at
the
time
the
officers
of
the
two
nations
seemed
to
vie
in
courtesy
a
boat
was
despatched
from
victoria
to
invite
them
to
enter
the
harbour
and
the
greatest
harmony
prevailed
during
their
stay
on
the
of
march
six
malay
proas
came
in
and
were
soon
followed
by
others
their
owners
soliciting
permission
to
erect
their
establishments
for
curing
trepang
under
the
protection
of
the
british
flag
this
being
granted
they
made
choice
of
a
spot
on
the
beach
and
a
little
subsidiary
settlement
soon
sprung
up
being
now
for
the
first
time
secure
from
the
attacks
of
the
natives
whose
hostility
had
until
then
forced
every
other
man
of
them
to
keep
under
arms
whilst
the
rest
worked
they
expected
to
pursue
their
occupation
with
far
greater
advantage
to
themselves
originally
hopes
were
entertained
that
a
very
large
population
of
malays
and
even
chinese
would
speedily
collect
at
port
essington
but
from
some
defect
in
the
colonial
regulations
their
immigration
was
for
a
time
checked
at
length
however
a
remedy
has
been
applied
and
facility
given
for
the
introduction
of
settlers
from
the
indian
archipelago
and
the
celestial
empire
the
great
difficulty
that
this
small
settlement
has
had
to
contend
with
from
the
beginning
is
the
climate
which
though
not
absolutely
pernicious
in
itself
is
unsuited
to
european
constitutions
the
settlers
have
been
attacked
at
various
times
by
fever
and
have
experienced
a
large
comparative
mortality
but
hopes
are
entertained
that
by
proper
regulations
especially
if
temperate
habits
could
be
introduced
this
may
be
avoided
the
capabilities
of
the
soil
though
it
has
by
some
been
pronounced
totally
unfit
for
agricultural
purposes
are
still
supposed
by
others
to
be
great
and
it
is
believed
that
if
colonists
capable
of
working
in
the
climate
could
be
induced
to
repair
to
port
essington
rice
cotton
indigo
etc
might
be
raised
of
the
finest
quality
and
in
great
abundance
the
livestock
at
the
settlements
consisted
by
the
last
accounts
of
an
english
cow
and
a
bull
two
indian
heifers
and
two
cows
above
fifty
goats
six
working
oxen
thirty
buffaloes
six
pigs
a
few
fowls
five
ponies
and
thirty
for
catching
kangaroos
some
of
these
were
private
others
public
property
several
cattle
have
been
lost
on
hearing
which
a
plan
that
had
before
suggested
itself
recurred
vividly
to
my
mind
i
once
thought
the
herds
of
buffalo
and
other
animals
might
be
prevented
from
straying
by
a
fence
run
across
the
peninsula
between
mount
norris
bay
and
the
corner
of
van
diemen
gulf
the
width
is
only
three
miles
and
the
rude
micmac
indians
of
newfoundland
have
carried
fences
for
a
similar
purpose
many
times
that
extent
the
necessity
of
so
doing
became
more
apparent
each
time
i
visited
the
place
especially
when
i
heard
of
herds
of
buffaloes
being
seen
upon
the
main
another
advantage
which
occurred
to
me
in
connection
with
this
subject
was
that
it
would
have
rendered
an
necessary
and
have
thus
led
to
a
further
communication
with
the
natives
which
would
ultimately
tend
to
increase
our
knowledge
of
them
and
the
interior
this
after
our
subsequent
discovery
of
adelaide
river
became
of
still
greater
moment
the
existence
of
the
would
also
form
a
change
for
the
settlers
and
journeys
thither
would
remove
the
dreary
inactivity
of
a
new
settlement
at
certain
periods
the
absence
of
this
fence
may
account
for
captain
grey
party
having
seen
signs
of
buffalo
on
the
mainland
he
discovered
the
tracks
of
a
animal
which
one
of
his
men
who
had
been
much
in
south
africa
at
once
recognised
as
the
spur
of
a
buffalo
but
one
advantage
can
arise
from
the
want
of
this
precaution
some
of
the
finest
lands
in
the
neighbourhood
of
sydney
now
called
cow
pastures
were
discovered
by
finding
them
to
be
the
constant
haunt
of
wild
cattle
a
similar
accident
might
prove
equally
advantageous
in
the
neighbourhood
of
port
essington
to
return
however
to
the
period
of
the
establishment
of
the
colony
it
was
of
course
deemed
desirable
to
take
an
early
opportunity
of
exploring
cobourg
peninsula
on
which
victoria
is
situated
and
accordingly
on
may
lieutenant
stewart
with
several
companions
started
on
an
exploring
expedition
they
carried
water
and
a
week
provisions
on
two
ponies
but
did
not
encumber
themselves
with
a
tent
sheltering
themselves
at
night
from
the
dew
in
little
huts
made
of
branches
on
the
second
day
they
crossed
several
running
streams
with
extensive
grassy
patches
and
came
to
a
halt
during
the
sultry
part
of
the
day
on
the
banks
of
a
river
or
chain
of
pools
here
grew
many
fine
of
a
light
colour
and
while
thick
woods
of
the
mangrove
appeared
on
all
sides
these
much
impeded
their
advance
and
prevented
them
from
making
any
great
progress
however
they
crossed
to
the
eastern
side
of
the
peninsula
where
they
found
a
rich
and
beautiful
country
in
some
parts
reminding
them
of
the
rich
south
american
forest
rather
than
the
dreary
sameness
of
an
australian
wood
numerous
tracks
of
the
buffalo
seemed
to
testify
to
the
excellence
of
the
pasture
several
evidences
also
of
the
presence
of
natives
were
from
time
to
time
discovered
and
at
length
a
small
party
met
them
and
exhibited
a
very
friendly
spirit
they
acted
as
guides
to
the
explorers
showing
them
where
water
could
be
found
giving
every
information
in
their
power
and
supplying
them
with
crabs
but
of
course
they
did
not
fail
to
ask
for
bread
of
which
as
much
as
could
be
spared
was
given
them
on
may
they
conducted
lieutenant
stewart
party
back
to
middle
head
and
he
expresses
great
surprise
at
the
precision
with
which
they
found
their
way
in
the
bush
without
having
any
apparent
means
to
guide
them
i
have
before
alluded
to
this
instinctive
power
of
the
aborigines
of
australia
lieutenant
stewart
gives
as
the
general
result
of
his
observations
extending
over
about
seventy
or
eighty
miles
that
there
is
abundance
of
fresh
water
on
the
peninsula
that
the
south
side
is
by
far
the
finest
and
best
watered
country
that
the
trees
are
there
free
from
the
white
ant
and
that
in
a
large
tract
of
country
the
abounds
he
also
observes
that
as
much
of
the
south
coast
as
he
saw
has
a
coral
reef
extending
about
a
mile
from
the
beach
and
that
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
tide
is
much
greater
than
at
port
essington
the
natives
were
found
by
the
settlers
as
we
have
already
stated
very
friendly
and
their
assistance
proved
valuable
they
brought
in
the
head
of
the
which
makes
an
excellent
vegetable
though
to
procure
it
the
tree
is
cut
down
and
destroyed
they
also
supplied
the
party
with
wild
honey
one
of
the
raffles
bay
tribe
instantly
made
himself
known
on
the
arrival
of
the
expedition
in
the
bay
he
was
called
by
the
name
of
alligator
on
account
of
his
huge
teeth
though
his
proper
appellation
was
marambari
from
lieutenant
of
britomart
i
received
much
valuable
information
respecting
the
natives
whom
i
find
to
be
divided
in
three
distinct
classes
which
do
not
intermarry
the
first
is
known
as
maudrojilly
the
second
as
mamburgy
the
third
as
mandrouilly
they
are
very
particular
about
the
distinction
of
classes
but
we
could
never
discover
which
was
the
superior
and
which
the
inferior
class
though
it
is
supposed
by
most
of
those
who
have
inquired
into
the
subject
that
the
madrojilly
or
first
class
head
the
others
in
war
and
govern
the
affairs
of
the
tribe
lieutenant
vallach
died
at
moulmain
in
these
aborigines
were
certainly
a
fine
race
differing
in
some
matters
from
the
other
natives
of
australia
their
hair
was
neither
curly
nor
straight
but
crisp
the
custom
of
extracting
a
front
tooth
prevails
among
them
while
the
nasal
cartilage
here
as
elsewhere
was
perforated
i
noticed
in
particular
that
they
did
not
make
use
of
the
boomerang
or
kiley
but
of
the
throwing
stick
or
womera
of
a
larger
kind
however
than
any
i
have
observed
elsewhere
the
head
of
their
spears
was
made
of
stone
they
have
a
smaller
kind
chiefly
used
to
kill
birds
and
other
animals
at
a
considerable
distance
they
have
also
large
heavy
clubs
while
the
natives
on
the
south
coast
carry
only
the
short
throwing
stick
they
go
wholly
naked
except
when
entering
the
settlements
on
which
occasions
they
wear
a
few
leaves
their
canoes
were
chiefly
obtained
from
the
malays
we
refer
our
readers
to
eyre
work
where
these
and
other
weapons
are
figured
i
here
saw
the
only
musical
instrument
i
ever
remarked
among
the
natives
of
australia
it
is
a
piece
of
bamboo
thinned
from
the
inside
through
which
they
blow
with
their
noses
it
is
from
two
to
three
feet
long
is
called
ebroo
and
produces
a
kind
of
droning
noise
it
is
generally
made
use
of
at
corrobories
or
dances
some
of
which
express
feats
of
hunting
and
war
while
others
are
very
indecent
and
reminded
us
of
similar
exhibitions
in
the
east
it
was
generally
remarked
that
the
old
clothes
given
to
these
savages
disappeared
in
a
most
mysterious
manner
they
were
understood
to
be
sold
to
the
natives
inhabiting
the
loftier
parts
of
the
interior
but
of
this
i
entertain
very
considerable
doubt
sand
in
which
the
australian
continent
abounds
is
like
everything
else
proceeding
from
the
hand
of
the
creator
not
without
its
uses
on
cold
nights
the
natives
make
up
for
their
total
want
of
covering
by
burying
themselves
in
it
and
nothing
can
be
more
irresistibly
comic
than
to
see
these
black
lumps
sticking
out
of
the
earth
like
so
many
enchanted
unfortunates
in
an
eastern
romance
it
moreover
has
other
uses
forming
a
substitute
for
soap
and
when
cooking
turtle
it
is
mixed
with
earth
and
sprinkled
over
the
meat
as
we
should
pepper
their
general
habits
are
cleanly
one
discovery
which
was
made
through
the
medium
of
the
natives
was
that
the
large
tumuli
noticed
by
captain
king
and
others
and
supposed
to
be
raised
by
the
inhabitants
are
the
works
of
a
bird
some
of
them
are
thirty
feet
long
and
about
five
feet
high
they
are
always
built
near
thick
bushes
in
which
they
can
take
shelter
at
the
least
alarm
the
edifice
is
erected
with
the
feet
which
are
remarkable
both
for
size
and
strength
and
a
peculiar
power
of
grasping
they
are
yellow
while
the
body
is
brown
nothing
can
be
more
curious
than
to
see
them
hopping
towards
these
piles
on
one
foot
the
other
being
filled
with
materials
for
building
though
much
smaller
in
shape
in
manner
they
much
resemble
the
use
made
of
the
mound
is
to
contain
eggs
which
are
deposited
in
layers
and
are
then
hatched
by
the
heat
generated
in
part
from
decomposition
the
instant
that
the
shell
bursts
the
young
bird
comes
forth
strong
and
large
and
runs
without
the
slightest
care
being
taken
of
it
by
the
parent
of
the
number
of
eggs
laid
by
each
bird
seldom
more
than
two
are
hatched
it
is
singular
that
these
mounds
are
found
away
from
the
earth
and
shells
of
which
they
are
composed
it
seems
difficult
to
credit
that
a
bird
so
small
could
raise
a
structure
so
large
the
largest
we
ever
saw
was
about
eight
feet
high
on
one
of
the
possession
islands
in
endeavour
strait
the
name
given
to
the
bird
by
gould
is
megapodius
tumulus
and
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
enter
upon
any
further
details
concerning
it
as
he
has
described
it
most
interestingly
in
his
work
on
the
birds
of
australia
great
numbers
of
kangaroos
were
also
found
here
which
at
the
period
of
our
arrival
the
settlers
were
just
getting
into
the
way
of
killing
there
are
three
varieties
of
which
the
largest
weighs
about
pounds
i
must
further
allude
to
a
most
beautiful
little
opossum
which
inhabits
these
parts
it
is
about
half
the
size
of
a
rat
and
designated
as
belideus
ariel
its
colour
and
fur
greatly
resemble
the
chinchilla
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
the
skin
is
valuable
and
might
be
made
an
article
of
trade
this
animal
has
a
membrane
between
the
fore
and
hind
paws
which
aids
it
to
some
extent
when
leaping
from
bough
to
bough
it
is
a
great
enemy
to
the
wild
bee
devouring
them
and
their
nests
the
bees
the
natives
discover
by
tapping
the
tree
and
listening
for
a
buzzing
from
within
those
we
saw
amounting
to
nearly
a
hundred
were
about
the
size
of
a
fly
of
a
dusky
black
colour
and
strange
to
say
were
hovering
round
an
empty
they
have
been
unsuccessfully
tried
in
hives
at
sydney
alligators
abound
and
one
of
the
marines
had
a
very
narrow
escape
from
them
it
appears
that
one
of
these
monsters
who
had
come
out
of
the
water
in
the
night
in
search
of
food
found
him
sleeping
in
his
hammock
which
he
had
very
injudiciously
hung
up
near
the
water
the
alligator
made
a
snap
at
his
prize
but
startled
at
this
frightful
interruption
of
his
slumbers
the
man
dexterously
extricated
himself
out
of
his
blanket
which
the
unwieldy
brute
doubtless
enraged
at
his
disappointment
carried
off
in
triumph
for
some
time
this
story
was
not
believed
but
when
afterwards
the
huge
reptile
on
a
similar
excursion
was
shot
a
portion
of
the
blanket
was
found
in
his
stomach
with
the
paw
of
a
favourite
spaniel
taken
when
swimming
off
the
pier
head
extensive
hauls
of
fish
were
made
on
point
record
amongst
which
one
species
there
called
salmon
was
most
excellent
eating
it
is
unnecessary
for
a
transient
visitor
to
enlarge
upon
the
birds
of
port
essington
as
in
gould
work
we
have
the
result
of
the
labours
of
an
individual
who
spent
months
collecting
in
the
neighbourhood
the
spot
selected
for
our
observations
was
government
house
where
nearly
a
hundred
observations
with
the
sun
and
stars
were
made
for
latitude
the
mean
result
being
degrees
minutes
seconds
south
which
strange
to
say
was
nearly
seconds
greater
than
captain
stanley
and
determination
this
difference
to
me
was
quite
unaccountable
as
the
instruments
used
in
the
beagle
were
before
and
subsequently
satisfactorily
tested
at
well
determined
places
the
longitude
being
affected
by
the
doubtful
meridian
distance
between
sydney
and
port
stephens
we
can
only
give
an
approximate
result
and
therefore
for
the
sake
of
the
longitudes
of
those
places
referred
to
the
meridian
of
port
essington
we
consider
it
degrees
minutes
east
of
greenwich
from
the
quantity
of
iron
in
the
rocks
at
victoria
it
was
impossible
to
get
any
satisfactory
observation
for
the
variation
of
the
compass
those
obtained
varied
from
to
degrees
east
we
found
that
tyers
had
made
about
seven
months
observations
on
the
tides
which
gave
a
very
irregular
rise
and
fall
varying
from
two
to
thirteen
feet
the
time
of
being
half
past
three
at
the
full
and
change
oxide
of
iron
is
found
in
some
places
in
large
quantities
and
is
used
by
the
natives
to
adorn
themselves
when
dancing
this
it
is
which
gives
to
the
coast
the
peculiar
red
hue
noticed
between
cape
croker
and
port
essington
many
of
the
cliffs
were
composed
of
a
marl
but
the
formation
is
chiefly
old
arenaceous
rocks
two
of
the
highest
and
most
remarkable
hills
on
the
peninsula
known
as
mounts
bedwell
and
rose
have
singular
flat
tops
bearing
some
resemblance
to
the
curious
appearance
of
cape
bedford
i
am
inclined
to
believe
this
formation
to
be
floetz
trappe
their
elevation
is
about
four
hundred
feet
being
twice
the
general
height
of
the
peninsula
raffles
bay
the
temperature
during
our
stay
averaged
degrees
while
land
and
sea
breezes
prevailed
we
should
not
omit
to
mention
that
lieutenant
stewart
when
visiting
raffles
bay
in
order
to
invite
the
french
officers
as
above
alluded
to
found
that
a
deep
inlet
intervening
formed
a
good
harbour
to
which
he
gave
the
name
of
port
bremer
of
the
old
settlement
nothing
remained
save
the
graves
of
those
whose
labours
had
tended
to
render
this
part
of
australia
another
outlet
for
the
surplus
population
of
the
mother
country
extending
at
the
same
time
the
blessings
of
civilization
the
rapid
growth
of
rank
vegetation
had
swept
all
else
away
and
there
in
solemn
solitude
upon
that
still
and
silent
shore
mouldered
the
bones
of
the
original
colonists
of
raffles
bay
whose
praiseworthy
efforts
were
rendered
futile
by
the
unfavourable
reports
forwarded
to
government
reports
we
can
not
think
entirely
free
from
prejudice
when
we
know
from
captain
law
account
that
one
of
the
commandants
declared
that
he
felt
disposed
to
sell
out
of
the
army
in
preference
to
going
there
one
thus
prepared
to
dislike
the
place
could
scarcely
be
expected
to
take
an
interest
in
the
country
or
endeavour
fully
to
develop
its
resources
see
wilson
voyage
round
the
world
page
we
can
not
avoid
expressing
our
regret
at
the
abandonment
of
the
settlement
in
raffles
bay
after
it
had
gone
on
so
far
successfully
under
captain
barker
excellent
management
in
mentioning
his
kindness
to
the
natives
to
whose
goodwill
we
must
always
owe
much
we
have
already
given
one
of
the
causes
which
assisted
in
fostering
the
undertaking
nothing
could
be
more
unwise
than
the
hostility
shown
to
the
natives
by
the
first
settlers
as
from
them
we
must
always
calculate
on
learning
much
that
is
useful
and
valuable
with
regard
to
the
productions
of
the
country
a
knowledge
which
would
otherwise
consume
much
time
to
acquire
this
was
not
the
only
matter
however
in
which
he
showed
his
superior
good
sense
and
judgment
his
enticing
the
people
of
macassar
to
come
and
locate
there
was
another
instance
of
his
foresight
which
would
have
led
in
time
to
very
favourable
results
he
was
soon
however
compelled
to
retract
his
invitation
writing
from
coepang
to
the
dutch
governor
of
macassar
in
order
to
stop
the
immigration
which
otherwise
would
have
been
considerable
with
all
these
several
elements
of
success
we
should
doubtless
but
for
the
abandonment
have
now
had
a
flourishing
settlement
in
northern
australia
the
causes
which
led
to
its
breaking
up
are
thus
succinctly
given
by
wilson
the
alleged
causes
were
first
the
unhealthiness
of
the
climate
secondly
the
hostility
of
the
natives
and
thirdly
the
of
the
malays
these
he
clearly
proved
as
we
have
subsequently
done
to
be
without
much
foundation
but
we
ourselves
do
not
so
much
deplore
the
leaving
of
raffles
bay
perhaps
an
site
but
rather
that
the
settlement
was
not
removed
instead
of
being
given
up
when
the
anxieties
and
difficulties
which
universally
accompany
the
formation
of
a
new
settlement
are
reflected
on
the
regret
we
have
already
expressed
will
be
more
easily
understood
when
port
essington
was
located
all
these
had
to
be
suffered
over
again
whereas
had
the
station
at
raffles
bay
been
transferred
thither
at
once
it
would
have
been
now
at
a
very
high
pitch
of
perfection
besides
however
small
the
spot
on
which
the
english
flag
waves
constantly
it
will
always
prove
a
check
on
the
marauding
propensities
of
the
neighbouring
islanders
and
thus
add
materially
to
the
general
welfare
and
civilization
of
such
portions
of
the
globe
as
fall
within
the
influence
of
the
respected
locality
in
further
proof
of
the
prospects
of
success
which
were
open
to
the
new
settlement
under
its
able
commandant
we
give
the
following
extract
from
wilson
journal
when
at
coepang
in
company
with
captain
barker
after
their
final
departure
from
raffles
bay
we
were
informed
by
the
master
of
the
mercus
that
many
chinese
were
about
to
emigrate
from
java
to
raffles
bay
having
recently
learned
that
they
would
be
permitted
to
do
so
the
total
abandonment
of
the
north
coast
of
new
holland
caused
much
regret
to
the
mercantile
people
here
as
they
had
anticipated
great
advantages
from
a
commercial
intercourse
narrative

leave
port
essington
july
finding
that
we
could
not
procure
a
supply
of
provisions
from
the
settlement
our
stay
was
necessarily
though
reluctantly
of
short
duration
and
on
the
morning
of
the
we
were
accordingly
running
out
of
port
essington
after
rounding
vashon
head
we
steered
to
the
westward
along
the
northern
side
of
the
peninsula
and
early
in
the
afternoon
anchored
in
popham
bay
one
point
of
which
is
formed
by
the
extreme
of
the
peninsula
a
low
projection
with
one
tall
mangrove
growing
on
the
point
and
fronted
by
an
extensive
coral
reef
past
which
a
tide
sweeps
into
the
gulf
of
van
diemen
on
the
eastern
side
of
this
projection
is
a
snug
boat
or
harbour
much
frequented
by
the
malays
who
call

it
may
be
recognized
by
a
little
island
lying
off
its
mouth
our
attention
having
been
directed
towards
the
openings
on
the
coast
opposite
melville
island
we
proceeded
towards
the
first
lying
on
the
south
side
of
clarence
strait
it
was
further
important
to
ascertain
if
that
strait
was
navigable
and
also
to
examine
the
side
of
melville
island
bird
island
finding
the
western
shore
of
cobourg
peninsula
placed
too
far
from
port
essington
on
the
chart
it
was
determined
to
commence
the
survey
at
popham

choosing
for
the
observation
spot
a
small
bank
of
sand
and
dead
coral
lying
in
its
centre
and
bearing
east
south
of
a
mile
from
where
we
anchored
in
nine
fathoms
we
named
this
bird
island
from
finding
it
almost
covered
with
terns
and
gulls
the
latitude
of
it
according
to
our
observations
was
degrees
minutes
south
and
longitude
west
of
port
essington
miles
being
less
than
is
given
in
captain

chart
the
extreme
of
the
peninsula
being
there
placed
too
far
from
port
essington
and
the
point
cape
croker
too
near
it
would
appear
that
the
discrepancy
was
chiefly
in
the
position
of
port
essington
with
respect
to
the
northern
extremes
of
the
peninsula
as
captain
king
and
ourselves
only
now
differ
two
miles
in
the
distance
between
cape

ours
being
the
greater
the
evening
was
calm
as
usual
while
midnight
brought
with
it
a
fresh
wind
during
the
night
the
temperature
was
as
low
as
degrees
july
on
leaving
at
daylight
we
crossed
over
to
examine
the
western
shores
of
dundas
strait
formed
by
the
eastern
side
of
melville
island
captain
king
having
passed
it
in
the
night
as
we
stood
close
along
it
into
the
gulf
we
found
the
soundings
very
irregular
six
miles
north
degrees
east
from
cape
keith
we
passed
over
two
patches
of
only
three
or
four
fathoms
these
we
could
not
see
from
the
general
disturbed
and
discoloured
state
of
the
water
it
blowing
fresh
from
we
found
the
nature
of
this
part
of
melville
island
to
be
low
rocky
points
separating
sandy
bays
one
of
the
few
remarkable
features
on
it
is
a
round
hill
feet
high
five
miles
from
cape
keith
clarence
strait
passing
the
latter
we
crossed
over
to
the
opposite
eastern
entrance
point
of
clarence
strait
cape
hotham
discovering
on
our
way
thither
a
reef
nearly
awash
about
two
miles
in
extent
bearing
south
degrees
west
fifteen
miles
from
cape
keith
and
north
degrees
east
fourteen
miles
from
cape
hotham
the
deepest
water
we
found
while
crossing
was
fathoms
five
miles
north
of
the
latter
the
general
depth
being
and
fathoms
the
wind
failing
in
the
afternoon
it
was
evening
when
we
reached
our
anchorage
in
nine
fathoms
cape
hotham
bearing
south
west
two
miles
and
a
half
and
close
to
the
edge
of
a
large
shoal
which
we
subsequently
found
to
extend
a
mile
and
a
half
north
and
six
miles
east
from
the
cape
here
we
found
the
tides
set
west
by
south
and
from
half
a
knot
to
two
knots
the
westerly
stream
beginning
nearly
three
hours
after
a
peculiarity
generally
occurring
in
straits
july
after
one
of
those
soft
and
lovely
evenings
so
common
to
this
part
of
australia
with
a
gentle
breeze
and
cloudless
sky
we
were
surprised
to
find
that
the
morning
opened
dreary
and
gloomy
there
was
a
very
fresh
wind
with
heavy
masses
of
clouds
the
breeze
continued
until
noon
when
as
usual
it
subsided
we
moved
the
ship
a
few
miles
down
the
opening
in
the
south
side
of
the
strait
and
in
the
afternoon
a
party
went
on
shore
near
cape
hotham
we
found
the
country
very
poor
and
sandy
and
elevated
about
fifteen
feet
above
mark
despite
this
the
white
appear
to
thrive
growing
in
great
abundance
about
thirty
or
forty
feet
high
there
were
also
others
of
a
different
kind
besides
a
few
palms
the
rocks
were
red
sand
and
ironstone
blended
together
in
some
places
i
noticed
it
had
the
same
glazed
and
vitrified
appearance
as
before
remarked
by
me
at
king
sound
on
the
coast
bynoe
who
was
of
the
party
added
to
his
collection
of
birds
a
kingfisher
and
a
specimen
of
a
glossy
species
about
the
size
and
colour
of
an
english
blackbird
others
were
seen
and
killed
but
all
common
to
other
parts
the
most
rare
of
the
latter
was
the
large
pigeon
i
have
alluded
to
some
few
pages
back
native
companion
the
white
ibis
with
a
black
neck
plentiful
in
king
sound
and
a
large
bird
a
species
of
crane
were
also
seen
the
latter
was
of
a
french
grey
hue
with
the
exception
of
the
head
which
was
black
and
of
the
shape
of
a
bittern
commonly
known
among
the
colonists
by
the
name
of
native
companion
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
this
name
could
have
originated
as
there
is
no
instance
of
the
natives
making
a
pet
of
anything
except
the
wild
dog
of
the
country
and
of
that
only
it
is
probable
from
its
utility
in
procuring
them
food
on
visiting
this
place
a
few
days
afterwards
to
repeat
the
observations
for
the
errors
of
the
chronometers
we
saw
a
few
natives
but
they
avoided
an
interview
disappearing
when
we
landed
they
made
the
same
motions
with
their
arms
throwing
them
open
and
bowing
as
the
natives
in
king
sound
did
the
few
huts
i
fell
in
with
reminded
me
of
one
i
had
seen
near
the
part
of
king
sound
a
representation
of
which
will
be
found
in
the
portion
of
the
work
descriptive
of
that
locality
those
on
cape
hotham
to
enter
more
into
particulars
did
not
exceed
five
feet
in
height
nor
were
they
so
substantially
built
they
were
however
well
thatched
with
the
same
kind
of
coarse
grass
the
entrances
were
carefully
closed
except
in
one
instance
when
the
aperture
was
so
small
that
it
was
with
difficulty
i
could
crawl
in
when
i
had
entered
there
was
nothing
to
gratify
my
curiosity
native
clothing
hanging
on
trees
round
these
habitations
were
specimens
of
an
article
of
clothing
never
before
seen
among
the
aborigines
of
australia
for
which
reason
i
have
been
induced
to
give
the
woodcut
of
one
it
is
a
kind
of
covering
for
the
shoulders
a
species
of
cape
made
from
coarse
grass
i
have
since
heard
from
earl
that
the
women
in
the
part
of
van
diemen
gulf
occasionally
wear
a
covering
round
their
waist
somewhat
similar
to
the
representation
given
baskets
were
also
left
hanging
on
the
trees
bespeaking
the
honesty
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
part
of
the
country
the
land
near
the
huts
was
turned
up
in
search
of
roots
and
close
by
were
some
large
clubs
the
thermometer
fell
in
the
night
to
degrees
producing
the
novel
though
pleasant
sensation
of
cold
july
although
apparently
we
could
trace
the
land
near
the
head
of
the
opening
or
bay
still
the
great
set
of
tide
in
that
direction
left
hopes
of
its
being
the
mouth
of
a
river
we
have
already
alluded
to
the
difficulty
of
detecting
the
mouth
of
australian
streams
and
the
doubts
thus
engendered
occasioned
the
greater
anxiety
impatient
to
learn
the
truth
fitzmaurice
was
despatched
to
examine
the
head
of
the
bay
whilst
the
ship
was
moved
towards
it
anchoring
again
one
mile
from
a
very
remarkable
patch
of
low
red
cliffs
which
from
startling
circumstances
hereafter
to
be
related
were
called
escape
cliffs
and
only
two
cables
length
distant
from
the
coral
ledge
by
which
this
and
the
shores
around
were
fronted
visit
the
shore
here
another
party
visited
the
shore
and
those
whose
occupation
did
not
render
their
presence
necessary
near
the
water
strolled
into
the
country
penetrating
about
four
or
five
miles
inland
but
they
were
rewarded
by
the
sight
of
no
novelty
or
even
variety
in
the
scenery
beyond
what
was
presented
to
our
view
on
the
visit
to
cape
hotham
which
it
will
readily
be
allowed
was
little
enough
indeed
it
will
in
general
be
found
that
in
australia
a
change
of
formation
is
necessary
to
produce
any
of
the
scenery
which
otherwise
exhibits
a
most
monotonous
sameness
a
coarse
kind
of
ironstone
gravel
was
if
i
may
use
the
term
scattered
over
the
face
of
the
country
some
of
it
had
a
glazed
appearance
on
the
surface
being
hollow
within
and
about
the
size
of
a
musket
ball
properly
speaking
they
are
composed
of
a
ferruginous
sandstone
but
they
have
been
already
more
fully
alluded
to
when
first
met
with
at
point
cunningham
near
king
sound
on
the
coast
the
general
formation
is
the
same
as
at
cape
hotham
itself
almost
identical
with
the
rocks
at
port
essington
a
few
traces
of
small
kangaroos
were
seen
but
not
a
bird
or
any
other
living
thing
two
miles
from
the
beach
this
peculiarity
the
reader
will
remember
was
also
noticed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
king
sound
discovery
of
adelaide
river
on
returning
to
the
ship
we
found
that
fitzmaurice
had
arrived
bringing
the
expected
and
very
gratifying
intelligence
that
a
large
river
with
two
branches
running
and
south
with
a
depth
of
four
fathoms
emptied
itself
into
the
head
of
the
bay
the
joy
a
discovery
of
this
nature
imparts
to
the
explorer
when
examining
a
country
so
proverbially
destitute
of
rivers
as
australia
is
much
more
easily
imagined
than
described
it
formed
a
species
of
oasis
amid
the
ordinary
routine
of
surveying
rousing
our
energies
and
giving
universal
delight
the
were
immediately
at
work
with
expectations
beyond
the
pale
of
reason
exploring
party
an
exploring
party
however
was
at
once
formed
consisting
of
captain
wickham
lieutenant
emery
and
helpman
who
the
next
day
being
sunday
did
not
leave
before
the
morning
of
the
with
two
boats
and
four
days
provisions
many
were
the
anxious
and
envious
looks
bestowed
on
the
party
as
they
left
the
ship
on
the
deeply
interesting
service
of
exploring
the
new
river
so
strong
and
native
is
man
desire
for
the
unknown
that
his
feelings
are
never
more
tried
than
when
on
the
brink
of
a
discovery
while
those
who
are
in
presence
of
the
novelty
and
can
not
enjoy
the
satisfaction
of
tasting
that
pleasure
must
ever
experience
somewhat
acute
emotions
of
regret
there
was
no
difficulty
in
finding
a
name
for
a
river
which
fell
into
clarence
strait
it
was
at
once
therefore
honoured
with
that
of
adelaide
after
her
most
gracious
majesty
the
queen
dowager
the
bay
that
receives
its
waters
was
called
after
sir
charles
adam
the
remaining
part
of
the
south
side
of
clarence
strait
together
with
the
islands
in
the
western
entrance
of
it
gave
ample
though
not
such
interesting
employment
as
the
exploration
of
the
adelaide
to
those
who
were
left
behind
several
unsuccessful
hauls
were
made
with
the
seine
fish
in
adam
bay
being
very
scarce
native
family
near
escape
cliffs
i
met
a
small
family
of
natives
consisting
of
an
elderly
man
his
wife
and
four
children
by
degrees
advancing
alone
i
contrived
to
get
near
enough
to
make
the
woman
a
present
of
a
handkerchief
in
return
for
which
she
gave
me
a
large
leaf
of
the
cabbage
palm
that
was
slung
across
her
back
i
at
length
drew
all
the
family
around
me
the
eldest
child
a
youth
of
about
being
the
most
timid
he
had
a
small
piece
of
wood
two
feet
long
sticking
through
the
cartilage
of
his
nose
his
teeth
and
those
of
the
other
children
were
quite
perfect
but
in
the
father
and
mother
two
of
the
upper
front
ones
were
gone
as
we
before
noticed
was
the
case
with
the
natives
at
port
essington
where
this
ceremony
is
performed
after
marriage
the
hair
of
these
people
was
neither
curly
nor
straight
but
what
i
have
before
called
crisp
being
of
that
wavy
nature
sometimes
noticed
in
europeans
they
had
with
them
three
dogs
of
a
light
brown
colour
of
which
they
appeared
very
fond
and
i
could
not
induce
them
to
part
with
them
the
old
man
spear
was
not
barbed
and
the
womera
or
throwing
stick
of
the
same
long
narrow
shape
as
at
port
essington
the
woman
had
also
the
same
basket
slung
over
her
neck
as
before
remarked
and
containing
white
and
red
earths
for
painting
their
bodies
curiosity
and
fear
these
people
exhibited
more
curiosity
than
i
had
before
noticed
in
the
aborigines
as
i
was
able
to
induce
them
to
visit
the
whaleboat
that
was
on
shore
close
by
here
as
in
other
places
the
size
of
the
oars
first
astonished
them
and
next
the
largeness
of
the
boat
itself
the
exclamations
of
surprise
given
vent
to
by
the
old
man
as
he
gazed
on
the
workmanship
of
his
civilized
brethren
were
amusing
suddenly
a
loud
shout
would
burst
from
his
lips
and
then
a
low
whistle
i
watched
the
rapid
change
of
countenance
in
this
wild
savage
with
interest
all
his
motions
were
full
of
matter
for
observation
the
mixed
curiosity
and
dread
depicted
in
his
dusky
face
the
feeling
of
secret
alarm
at
this
first
rencontre
with
a
white
man
intruding
in
his
native
wilds
which
he
must
have
experienced
added
much
to
the
zest
of
the
scene
i
however
at
length
almost
persuaded
the
old
man
to
accompany
me
on
board
he
even
put
one
foot
in
the
boat
for
the
purpose
when
seeing
the
depth
of
the
interior
he
recoiled
with
a
slight
shudder
as
if
from
immersion
in
cold
water
he
was
now
overwhelmed
by
the
woman
and
elder
child
with
entreaties
not
to
take
such
a
rash
step
and
their
rude
eloquence
succeeded
it
was
amusing
to
see
the
struggle
between
fear
and
curiosity
plainly
depicted
in
the
man
face
as
he
stood
with
one
foot
on
the
boat
and
the
other
on
the
shore
hearkening
but
too
credulously
to
the
picture
of
danger
forcibly
drawn
by
his
friends
while
curiosity
with
almost
equal
strength
was
urging
him
to
dare
the
perils
of
the
white
man
boat
a
desire
to
be
better
acquainted
with
the
strangers
who
had
come
to
the
shores
of
his
native
land
in
a
large
bird
such
being
their
strange
idea
of
a
ship
the
sails
forming
the
wings
no
doubt
materially
influenced
him
but
the
eloquence
of
his
relatives
prevailed
over
all
and
this
interesting
interview
terminated
by
our
leaving
the
shore
without
our
sable
friend
who
however
promised
to
visit
the
ship
in
an
old
bark
canoe
about
feet
long
that
was
lying
on
the
beach
near
at
hand
this
promise
was
faithfully
kept
for
the
same
evening
a
canoe
was
seen
paddling
off
containing
two
young
natives
in
addition
to
the
old
man
they
stopped
at
some
distance
from
the
ship
moving
round
to
view
her
on
all
sides
attempt
to
entice
natives
on
board
fearing
at
last
that
their
courage
had
failed
and
that
they
would
not
come
on
board
the
dinghy
our
smallest
boat
was
sent
towards
them
there
being
only
a
boy
besides
myself
in
it
i
had
hoped
that
thus
they
would
not
be
frightened
but
they
instantly
began
to
move
towards
the
shore
and
it
required
some
manoeuvring
to
get
near
them
succeeding
at
length
however
i
found
my
acquaintance
of
the
morning
anxious
to
go
to
the
ship
a
measure
the
other
two
did
not
at
all
approve
of
as
they
kept
edging
away
towards
the
land
whilst
i
gave
the
old
man
the
presents
i
had
brought
him
at
one
time
the
dinghy
got
between
the
canoe
and
the
shore
when
instantly
a
gleam
of
terror
flashed
across
the
faces
of
the
young
men
one
of
them
was
a
large
fellow
of
ferocious
aspect
whose
countenance
was
lit
up
by
a
look
of
fierce
revenge
as
the
canoe
made
towards
the
land
after
i
had
ceased
my
endeavours
to
entice
them
on
board
whatever
these
people
may
have
imagined
to
be
our
motive
in
wishing
them
to
visit
the
ship
i
little
thought
that
my
pressing
them
would
have
so
nearly
led
to
fatal
results
i
shall
proceed
to
explain
this
remark
by
relating
the
startling
circumstances
from
which
escape
cliffs
received
their
name
narrow
escape
of
fitzmaurice
a
few
days
after
my
interview
in
the
dinghy
with
the
natives
fitzmaurice
went
ashore
to
compare
the
compasses
from
the
quantity
of
iron
contained
in
the
rocks
it
was
necessary
to
select
a
spot
free
from
their
influence
a
sandy
beach
at
the
foot
of
escape
cliffs
was
accordingly
chosen
the
observations
had
been
commenced
and
were
about
half
completed
when
on
the
summit
of
the
cliffs
which
rose
about
twenty
feet
above
their
heads
suddenly
appeared
a
large
party
of
natives
with
poised
and
quivering
spears
as
if
about
immediately
to
deliver
them
stamping
on
the
ground
and
shaking
their
heads
to
and
fro
they
threw
out
their
long
shaggy
locks
in
a
circle
whilst
their
glaring
eyes
flashed
with
fury
as
they
champed
and
spit
out
the
ends
of
their
long
beards
they
were
evidently
in
earnest
and
bent
on
mischief
a
custom
with
australian
natives
when
in
a
state
of
violent
excitement
dancing
for
life
it
was
therefore
not
a
little
surprising
to
behold
this
paroxysm
of
rage
evaporate
before
the
happy
presence
of
mind
displayed
by
fitzmaurice
in
immediately
beginning
to
dance
and
shout
though
in
momentary
expectation
of
being
pierced
by
a
dozen
spears
in
this
he
was
imitated
by
keys
who
was
assisting
in
the
observations
and
who
at
the
moment
was
a
little
distance
off
and
might
have
escaped
without
however
thinking
of
himself
he
very
nobly
joined
his
companion
in
amusing
the
natives
and
they
succeeded
in
diverting
them
from
their
evident
evil
designs
until
a
boat
landing
in
a
bay
near
drew
off
their
attention
the
foremost
of
this
party
was
recognised
to
be
the
fellow
who
left
me
in
the
canoe
with
a
revengeful
scowl
upon
his
face
fitzmaurice
and
keys
had
firearms
lying
on
the
ground
within
reach
of
their
hands
the
instant
however
they
ceased
dancing
and
attempted
to
touch
them
a
dozen
spears
were
pointed
at
their
breasts
their
lives
hung
upon
a
thread
and
their
escape
must
be
regarded
as
truly
wonderful
and
only
to
be
attributed
to
the
happy
readiness
with
which
they
adapted
themselves
to
the
perils
of
their
situation
this
was
the
last
we
saw
of
the
natives
in
adam
bay
and
the
meeting
is
likely
to
be
long
remembered
by
some
and
not
without
pleasant
recollections
for
although
at
the
time
it
was
justly
looked
upon
as
a
very
serious
affair
it
afterwards
proved
a
great
source
of
mirth
no
one
could
recall
to
mind
without
laughing
the
ludicrous
figure
necessarily
cut
by
our
shipmates
when
to
amuse
the
natives
they
figured
on
the
light
fantastic
toe
and
the
readers
who
look
at
the
plate
representing
this
really
serious
affair
will
behold
two
men
literally
dancing
for
their
lives
see
above
return
of
the
boats
august
this
morning
the
boats
returned
they
had
gone
up
the
adelaide
in
a
general
southerly
direction
nearly
miles
the
windings
of
the
river
which
were
very
great
in
some
places
forming
the
shape
of
the
letter
it
became
at
this
distance
very
narrow
and
was
divided
into
two
branches
one
taking
a
southerly
direction
the
other
an
easterly
the
latter
was
too
narrow
for
the
boat
oars
while
the
former
was
blocked
up
by
fallen
trees
lying
across
it
as
in
addition
to
the
difficulties
just
mentioned
only
one
day
provision
remained
in
the
boats
the
further
exploration
of
the
adelaide
was
necessarily
though
reluctantly
abandoned
banks
of
the
adelaide
for
thirty
miles
of
the
upper
part
of
the
river
the
water
was
fresh
while
the
banks
excepting
near
the
point
of
separation
were
low
being
not
more
than
five
feet
above
the
present
level
of
the
river
a
circumstance
very
favourable
for
irrigation
and
the
cultivation
of
rice
fifteen
miles
from
the
mouth
they
were
fringed
by
the
growth
of
mangroves
and
higher
up
many
of
the
points
were
thickly
wooded
while
on
either
side
stretched
a
vast
extent
of
prairie
country
dotted
here
and
there
with
islands
of
timber
which
served
to
break
the
native
monotony
of
the
scene
somewhat
less
than
halfway
up
rose
on
both
banks
a
thick
jungle
of
bamboo
which
in
places
where
the
water
was
always
fresh
attained
the
gigantic
height
of
from
to
feet
between
and
miles
from
the
mouth
the
soil
is
a
good
mould
above
this
commencing
where
the
bank
of
the
river
is
marked
by
a
coarse
red
gritty
sandstone
projection
the
aspect
of
the
country
changes
from
that
of
low
plains
to
a
slightly
wooded
and
gently
undulating
surface
in
some
places
stony
this
character
continued
to
the
furthest
point
reached
in
the
boats
in
latitude
degrees
minutes
south
and
longitude
degrees
minutes
east
when
they
had
penetrated
thus
far
into
the
new
lands
of
australia
the
explorers
returned
having
experienced
those
sensations
of
delightful
excitement
to
which
we
have
before
alluded
and
which
naturally
called
forth
strong
emotions
of
regret
in
those
who
were
denied
a
participation
in
the
feverish
enjoyment
of
discovery
from
the
highest
tree
at
captain
wickham
furthest
point
the
appearance
of
the
country
was
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
one
wearisome
level
broken
to
the
southward
at
a
distance
of
ten
miles
by
a
rocky
mound
about
feet
high
upper
part
of
the
river
the
river
which
for
some
distance
had
not
been
fifty
yards
wide
with
a
rocky
bed
in
places
and
banks
from
six
to
twenty
feet
high
was
subject
at
this
point
to
a
tidal
change
of
level
of
about
three
feet
but
there
was
no
perceptible
stream
and
the
water
which
a
few
miles
lower
down
had
been
muddy
was
here
quite
clear
small
bamboos
and
other
drift
were
observed
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
eight
or
ten
feet
above
the
water
showing
the
height
which
the
river
attains
at
some
seasons
of
the
year
by
the
hollows
on
many
of
the
plains
water
appeared
to
have
lain
some
time
and
doubtless
parts
of
this
low
land
were
periodically
overflowed
on
the
point
dividing
the
upper
branches
of
the
river
some
coarse
sand
was
washed
up
which
on
examination
was
found
to
be
of
a
granitic
character
clearly
showing
the
primary
formation
of
the
country
through
which
the
adelaide
flowed
the
only
rocks
noticed
in
the
parts
traversed
by
the
boats
were
as
i
have
before
said
of
red
porous
sandstone
the
smoke
of
several
large
fires
was
observed
up
the
country
but
none
of
the
natives
were
seen
towards
the
upper
part
of
the
river
they
noticed
a
strange
bird
very
much
like
a
guineafowl
in
size
and
manner
of
running
along
the
ground
the
colour
was
speckled
white
and
brown
this
doubtless
from
bynoe
description
of
one
he
wounded
on
the
coast
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
adelaide
must
have
been
the
leipoa
ocellata
of
gould
one
of
the
mound
or
birds
first
seen
in
western
australia
by
george
moore
and
afterwards
on
the
coast
and
in
south
australia
by
captain
grey
although
known
to
range
over
a
large
expanse
of
the
continent
this
was
the
first
time
it
was
discovered
in
northern
australia
in
the
reaches
where
the
bamboo
grew
flights
of
large
vampires
resembling
the
pteropus
rubricollis
of
geoff
were
met
with
they
kept
continually
flying
to
and
fro
close
over
the
boats
as
they
passed
up
making
a
screeching
disagreeable
noise
which
however
was
far
less
unpleasant
than
the
mildewy
odour
with
which
they
filled
the
air
calling
to
mind
the
exclamation
placed
by
our
immortal
bard
in
the
mouth
of
trinculo
the
heavy
flap
of
the
leathern
wings
of
these
as
the
men
called
them
was
singular
while
sometimes
a
flight
would
darken
the
verdure
of
a
bamboo
which
yielding
to
their
weight
bent
low
as
if
before
a
passing
gust
of
wind
to
fix
themselves
appeared
always
a
difficult
and
was
certainly
a
noisy
operation
each
apparently
striving
to
alight
upon
the
same
spot
they
first
cling
to
the
bamboo
by
means
of
the
long
claw
or
hook
attached
to
the
outer
edge
of
the
wing
and
then
gradually
settle
themselves
the
river
swarmed
with
alligators
fish
also
abounded
and
in
the
salt
water
a
kind
commonly
known
in
the
river
plate
by
the
name
of
is
plentiful
one
that
we
caught
was
of
the
enormous
weight
of
twenty
pounds
a
large
kind
of
dark
bream
of
excellent
flavour
was
taken
in
fresh
water
many
of
the
reaches
also
swarmed
with
wildfowl
consisting
almost
wholly
of
ducks
which
from
a
habit
of
perching
on
the
trees
have
received
the
name
of
they
were
very
different
and
far
superior
in
plumage
to
those
found
on
the
parts
of
the
continent
and
as
they
have
not
yet
been
numbered
among
the
australian
birds
so
vividly
described
by
gould
we
may
venture
to
be
somewhat
minute
in
describing
them
they
are
inferior
in
size
to
the
common
european
wild
duck
but
are
marked
in
much
the
same
manner
on
the
breast
the
back
is
a
dark
brown
while
the
wings
still
darker
are
slightly
bronzed
at
the
tips
their
singularly
long
legs
are
of
a
pale
flesh
colour
while
the
web
on
the
foot
is
very
much
arched
near
the
toes
giving
greater
pliability
to
the
foot
and
a
power
of
grasping
which
enables
them
to
perch
on
trees
the
head
and
bill
the
latter
of
a
pale
ash
colour
are
both
large
when
on
the
wing
they
make
a
peculiar
though
pleasing
whistling
sound
that
can
be
heard
at
a
great
distance
and
which
changes
as
they
alight
into
a
sort
of
chatter
their
perching
on
trees
is
performed
in
a
very
clumsy
manner
swinging
and
pitching
to
and
fro
we
subsequently
often
found
them
on
the
rivers
on
the
north
coast
but
not
within
some
miles
of
their
mouths
or
near
their
upper
waters
from
which
it
would
appear
that
they
inhabit
certain
reaches
of
the
rivers
only
we
never
found
them
in
swamps
the
farthest
south
they
were
afterwards
met
with
was
on
the
albert
river
in
the
gulf
of
carpentaria
in
latitude
degrees
south
which
gives
them
a
range
of
six
and
a
half
degrees
of
latitude
over
the
northern
part
of
the
continent
their
nests
never
came
under
our
notice
and
consequently
we
are
not
aware
either
of
the
size
or
colour
of
their
eggs
neither
did
we
see
any
young
birds
during
the
period
of
our
observation
ranging
from
july
to
november
only
eyre
has
since
informed
me
that
there
is
a
something
similar
on
the
murray
river
but
is
not
aware
that
it
has
the
peculiar
habit
of
perching
on
trees
gould
who
had
previously
described
this
bird
leptotarais
eytoni
being
desirous
of
figuring
it
in
his
splendid
work
has
been
furnished
with
this
account
exploration
of
the
southern
branch
of
the
adelaide
august
the
southern
arm
of
the
adelaide
river
and
about
fifteen
miles
near
the
mouth
of
the
other
branch
still
remaining
to
be
explored
i
started
on
this
interesting
service
the
day
of
the
return
of
captain
wickham
august
we
soon
found
that
the
one
we
ascended
promised
nothing
from
there
being
no
tidal
stream
of
any
consequence
still
we
hoped
to
trace
its
rejunction
with
the
main
branch
but
after
proceeding
in
a
general
south
by
west
direction
five
miles
and
the
same
distance
it
became
so
narrow
that
the
mangroves
on
each
side
entirely
blocked
up
the
passage
and
stopped
the
boat
progress
i
here
again
felt
the
inconvenience
of
our
not
being
furnished
with
one
of
the
pendulum
horizons
invented
by
captain
becher
it
being
and
as
the
shore
was
lined
with
an
impenetrable
growth
of
mangroves
we
were
unable
to
land
in
vain
did
i
try
by
cutting
down
some
of
them
to
find
a
rest
for
the
artificial
horizon
on
one
of
the
stumps
they
were
so
connected
with
each
other
beneath
the
water
by
a
perfect
network
of
roots
that
although
several
of
the
surrounding
trees
were
felled
a
tremulous
motion
was
still
conveyed
from
a
distance
and
i
consequently
lost
the
observation
for
latitude
i
strongly
recommend
this
ingenious
invention
to
every
seaman
in
foggy
weather
it
will
save
hours
of
anxiety
and
may
often
prevent
the
horrors
of
shipwreck
the
saltwater
arm
of
the
adelaide
we
found
had
another
branch
which
took
us
eight
miles
in
a
direction
terminating
like
the
other
and
at
being
a
mere
ditch
there
was
nothing
picturesque
in
following
the
windings
of
these
creeks
or
inlets
a
tall
growth
of
mangroves
with
their
stems
immersed
rendering
the
view
limited
and
wearisome
we
however
were
urged
on
by
hope
being
in
momentary
expectation
that
each
turn
would
bring
some
change
while
to
add
to
the
zest
of
our
proceedings
we
felt
ourselves
to
be
the
first
europeans
who
had
traversed
these
parts
now
and
then
the
deep
stillness
of
nature
would
be
broken
by
the
mournful
cry
of
a
curlew
disturbed
by
the
splash
of
the
oars
while
sometimes
a
heavy
flapping
of
wings
was
heard
amid
the
mangroves
and
out
would
start
suddenly
three
or
four
white
ibises
with
black
necks
giving
utterance
to
a
peculiar
cry
which
faintly
resembles
that
of
the
male
guinea
fowl
all
else
was
deep
unbroken
silence
by
evening
we
had
again
reached
the
entrance
of
the
river
where
we
passed
the
night
during
which
there
was
a
very
heavy
dew
august
the
lower
part
of
the
adelaide
having
been
already
explored
prevented
us
from
experiencing
that
depth
of
interest
which
we
should
otherwise
have
felt
still
we
were
destined
to
enjoy
our
share
of
pleasurable
sensations
as
on
the
result
of
our
examination
depended
the
important
fact
of
whether
the
river
was
navigable
for
large
vessels
we
therefore
started
to
settle
this
momentous
question
even
before
the
eastern
sky
was
tinted
with
orange
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
which
in
these
latitudes
gives
no
glimmering
twilight
day
fading
and
appearing
instantaneously
the
rapidity
of
the
change
presenting
a
remarkable
effect
extensive
reaches
passing
a
narrow
part
formed
by
two
low
red
cliffy
projections
we
entered
a
wide
reach
that
had
an
extensive
flat
of
and
fathoms
water
on
the
south
side
the
next
was
similarly
circumstanced
the
shoal
water
of
the
same
depth
being
however
on
the
west
side
still
in
both
there
was
a
channel
at
and
in
the
reaches
above
seven
in
number
trending
in
a
general
direction
about
twice
that
depth
this
imparted
to
our
discoveries
the
stamp
of
utility
and
as
captain
wickham
found
it
navigable
for
thirty
miles
higher
up
where
the
water
is
fresh
we
may
pronounce
the
adelaide
the
deepest
river
in
australia
meet
a
canoe
proceeding
upwards
we
met
a
party
of
natives
about
seven
miles
from
the
mouth
in
a
very
pretty
bark
canoe
fifteen
feet
long
and
about
two
deep
the
bark
was
sewn
together
with
much
neatness
and
it
was
altogether
the
most
artistic
piece
of
workmanship
i
had
seen
among
the
aborigines
of
australia
it
was
the
last
of
that
description
we
met
with
in
this
direction
for
we
did
not
find
canoes
in
use
with
the
natives
to
the
westward
of
clarence
strait
but
only
rafts
a
fact
alluded
to
in
an
earlier
portion
of
the
work
alarm
of
the
natives
two
young
men
only
were
in
the
craft
which
ran
close
in
under
the
mangroves
through
which
we
could
see
other
natives
passing
by
proceeding
cautiously
and
slowly
i
got
pretty
close
to
them
they
were
evidently
afraid
that
if
they
left
it
we
should
take
their
boat
and
this
gave
them
courage
to
face
the
strange
white
men
terror
however
was
marked
in
their
countenances
and
one
of
the
two
leaped
on
shore
as
we
approached
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
jumping
and
flinging
his
arms
about
violently
whilst
sometimes
he
would
dip
up
a
handful
of
water
and
squirt
it
out
with
great
force
from
the
corners
of
his
mouth
the
size
of
the
boat
appeared
as
usual
to
astonish
the
lad
who
remained
in
the
canoe
he
appeared
less
frightened
than
the
other
and
i
induced
him
to
accept
a
few
presents
from
the
end
of
a
long
stick
though
they
had
a
deficiency
in
the
upper
front
teeth
they
had
not
disfigured
any
other
part
of
their
bodies
the
stature
of
the
two
young
men
was
small
perhaps
feet
inches
but
those
behind
the
mangroves
were
much
taller
alligators
being
so
very
numerous
i
was
surprised
to
notice
what
little
dread
the
natives
appeared
to
have
of
them
dancing
and
wading
about
in
the
water
near
the
bank
as
if
they
and
the
animal
had
entered
into
a
treaty
of
amity
their
alarm
appearing
to
have
worn
off
we
continued
our
journey
but
by
hoisting
the
sail
the
good
effect
was
in
a
great
measure
counterbalanced
as
the
sight
of
it
called
forth
a
yell
from
the
whole
of
them
which
catching
the
echoes
reverberated
from
side
to
side
and
resounded
in
our
ears
for
some
time
afterwards
proceeding
we
gained
the
end
of
the
twelfth
reach
early
in
the
afternoon
when
we
obtained
observations
for
longitude
that
being
the
highest
part
of
the
river
not
surveyed
and
distant
about
fifteen
miles
from
the
mouth
we
had
also
just
reached
the
portion
frequented
by
the
peculiar
whistling
wild
duck
of
which
we
bagged
about
twenty
forming
an
agreeable
addition
to
our
evening
and
next
day
meals
after
concluding
the
observations
we
examined
the
country
for
some
distance
a
level
tract
met
the
eye
wherever
it
wandered
broken
here
and
there
by
patches
of
low
trees
the
plains
were
thinly
dotted
with
a
coarse
wiry
grass
in
places
near
hollows
where
water
had
collected
the
soil
which
was
a
dark
kind
of
clayey
mould
cracked
and
curled
up
with
the
heat
a
few
shells
were
found
scattered
over
the
plains
of
the
kind
so
common
on
the
coast
helix
the
tedious
uniformity
and
sameness
in
the
banks
of
the
adelaide
thus
far
may
be
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
to
know
the
boat
position
on
returning
it
was
necessary
to
have
the
sketch
of
the
river
constantly
before
our
eyes
and
to
reckon
each
reach
as
we
passed
alligators
taking
the
return
tide
we
passed
the
night
in
the
fourth
reach
very
stringent
orders
were
given
to
the
watch
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
alligators
as
a
great
many
had
been
seen
during
the
day
while
we
knew
that
on
the
previous
night
a
monster
of
this
description
had
attempted
to
get
into
one
of
the
boats
we
had
fired
at
several
but
with
one
exception
had
done
no
mischief
to
be
roused
by
the
noise
of
the
keel
or
side
grating
harshly
against
the
scaly
back
of
an
alligator
is
far
from
being
a
pleasant
occurrence
and
on
such
occasions
i
generally
found
myself
clutching
a
pistol
always
kept
near
me
for
the
purpose
of
executing
judgment
upon
the
very
first
flat
head
that
showed
his
nose
above
the
gunwale
entertaining
very
vivid
recollections
of
our
experience
on
fitzroy
river
on
the
first
start
of
the
boats
great
preparations
were
made
against
the
mosquitoes
to
our
agreeable
surprise
however
we
experienced
but
slight
annoyance
from
them
the
exemption
however
was
fully
made
up
by
the
swarms
of
flies
which
infest
the
adelaide
and
during
mealtimes
availed
themselves
of
the
opportunity
of
popping
into
our
mouths
there
had
been
a
fresh
wind
the
latter
part
of
the
day
which
dying
away
was
succeeded
by
a
calm
and
cloudless
night
with
a
heavy
dew
the
thermometer
was
down
to
degrees
and
in
the
day
varied
from
to
return
of
the
boats
august
we
got
on
board
in
the
forenoon
when
the
result
of
our
examination
was
heard
with
a
satisfaction
not
easily
expressed
but
which
may
be
readily
imagined
we
felt
that
we
had
discovered
a
river
navigable
for
vessels
of
four
and
five
hundred
tons
for
about
fifty
miles
and
into
fresh
water
a
thing
hitherto
unknown
in
australia
we
may
then
with
justice
congratulate
ourselves
on
the
importance
of
the
discovery
of
the
adelaide
adam
bay
the
bay
into
which
it
flows
named

at

deeply
interesting
researches
on

south
side
of

strait
leading
to
so
important
a
discovery
were
now
concluded
examine
melville
island
the
success
which
had
rewarded
our
efforts
made
us
wish
to
cling
to
the
spot
and
it
was
therefore
almost
with
regret
that
we
found
ourselves
leaving
to
examine
the
southern
shores
of
melville
island
where
we
anchored
two
miles
from
the
beach
and
fifteen
within
the
west
entrance
of
the
strait
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
the
sandy
flat
extending
some
distance
from
the
shore
there
was
one
fathom
of
water
being
a
very
gradual
decrease
from
six
where
the
ship
lay
the
necessary
angles
and
bearings
for
the
survey
were
taken
from
the
top
of
some
cliffs
sixty
feet
high
composed
of
a
red
sand
and
ironstone
and
a
white
kind
of
marl
or
pipe
clay
the
shore
trended
nearly
and
six
miles
in
the
former
direction
is
an
inlet
which
fitzmaurice
has
visited
from
the
vernon
isles
and
another
much
smaller
about
a
third
of
the
intervening
distance
from
where
we
stood
the
high
land
which
was
almost
level
lay
about
three
miles
in
our
rear
following
the
trend
of
the
shore
two
peaks
rising
in
hollows
on
it
attained
an
elevation
of
and
feet
there
were
no
rocky
points
visible
at
a
clean
sandy
beach
which
appeared
strange
to
say
to
have
been
washed
occasionally
by
a
heavy
surf
forming
the
coastline
a
singular
clump
of
casuarina
was
close
to
the
westward
of
the
cliffs
and
its
dark
naked
aspect
contrasted
with
the
stunted
gumtrees
and
scattered
palms
sparingly
sprinkled
over
this
sterile
tract
of
country
with
the
exception
of
a
few
seabirds
there
was
nothing
living
stirring
to
change
the
opinion
we
have
just
expressed
of
this
part
of
melville
island
our
visit
however
was
not
to
be
forgotten
in
an
instant
although
no
very
pleasing
recollections
were
connected
with
it
green
ants
whilst
taking
a
few
angles
near
the
cliffs
we
suddenly
experienced
a
series
of
severe
bites
or
nippings
in
several
parts
of
our
body
and
looking
round
to
discover
whence
arose
this
unexpected
attack
found
ourselves
under
a
tree
covered
with
large
green
ants
their
bites
were
exceedingly
painful
and
it
was
only
by
beating
and
tearing
off
our
clothes
that
we
could
rid
ourselves
of
these
unwelcome
visitors
from
a
distance
our
appearance
must
have
been
sufficiently
amusing
one
moment
soberly
intent
upon
our
duties
and
the
next
jumping
like
madmen
and
hastily
stripping
off
our
garments
the
name
of
ant
cliffs
records
our
visit
to
the
south
shores
of
melville
island
the
tide
on
this
side
of
the
strait
ran
nearly
two
knots
an
hour
following
the
direction
of
the
shore
the
time
of
being
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
than
in
adam
bay
august
recrossed
clarence
strait
to
obtain
observations
for
rating
the
chronometers
and
examine
the
extensive
shoal
off
cape
hotham
on
anchoring
near
its
edge
a
patch
with
only
five
feet
was
discovered
close
to
the
ship
the
muddy
and
restless
state
of
the
water
caused
by
a
meeting
of
the
tides
setting
out
of
van
diemen
gulf
and
adam
bay
renders
it
necessary
to
approach
cape
hotham
from
the
northward
with
caution
however
the
unusually
great
depth
for
this
strait
of
twenty
fathoms
will
give
warning
of
a
ship
proximity
to
this
danger
the
limits
of
which
have
been
given
on
the
occasion
of
our
first
visit
to
cape
hotham
want
of
water
our
stock
of
water
being
now
much
reduced
it
was
necessary
before
proceeding
further
that
we
should
procure
a
supply
as
it
was
a
matter
of
no
certainty
that
we
should
find
sufficient
on
the
coast
to
the
westward
it
was
at
first
suggested
that
we
should
take
the
ship
up
the
adelaide
and
fill
the
tanks
from
alongside
this
would
have
been
a
grand
feat
having
never
before
been
accomplished
in
any
river
in
australia
indeed
it
was
the
only
one
on
the
whole
continent
which
could
carry
up
a
vessel
of
the
beagle
draught
into
fresh
water
an
idea
the
realization
of
which
would
so
completely
crown
our
exploration
with
success
naturally
gave
rise
to
a
great
degree
of
enthusiasm
and
excitement
soon
however
more
sober
thoughts
prevailed
when
we
reflected
on
the
time
this
proceeding
would
consume
on
account
of
the
course
of
the
river
time
which
we
could
with
our
scanty
stock
of
provisions
ill
spare
at
port
essington
it
was
possible
we
should
be
able
to
get
a
supply
of
both
as
a
ship
might
have
arrived
during
our
absence
moreover
it
was
highly
important
that
we
should
make
known
without
delay
the
discovery
of
a
river
of
such
magnitude
as
the
adelaide
distant
only
seventy
miles
from
the
settlement
nothing
shows
the
flat
nature
of
a
country
more
than
the
tortuous
course
of
a
stream
passing
through
it
it
is
a
want
of
change
in
the
level
which
causes
a
river
to
twist
and
wind
about
in
search
as
it
were
of
the
weakest
spot
for
its
exit
return
towards
port
essington
it
was
then
finally
resolved
that
we
should
return
to
port
essington
and
in
the
forenoon
of
the
the
beagle
was
drifting
along
the
western
shore
of
dundas
strait
out
of
van
diemen
gulf
the
day
happening
very
remarkably
for
the
locality
at
this
season
to
be
calm
throughout
the
anchor
was
dropped
at
sunset
in
fathoms
cape
fleming
the
point
of
melville
island
bearing
west
eight
miles
a
deep
sandy
bay
bore
five
miles
which
promised
good
anchorage
the
appearance
of
the
part
of
melville
island
was
still
very
triste
presenting
to
the
eye
nothing
save
patches
of
mangroves
behind
which
rose
a
range
of
hills
feet
in
elevation
the
tide
out
of
van
diemen
gulf
takes
a
direction
until
coming
in
contact
with
cape
keith
it
branches
off
along
the
east
and
south
side
of
melville
island
we
anchored
to
prevent
being
taken
back
through
dundas
strait
by
the
return
tide
which
from
to
midnight
set
by
south
from
two
to
three
knots
an
hour
at
popham
bay
on
the
east
side
of
the
strait
being
at
a
quarter
past
eleven
we
may
conclude
the
stream
began
at
this
anchorage
three
quarters
of
an
hour
after
weighing
as
soon
as
the
tide
made
out
of
the
strait
although
there
was
still
no
wind
we
were
rather
surprised
at
daylight
to
find
how
little
the
ship
had
drifted
to
the
the
only
reason
i
can
give
in
explanation
is
that
the
ebb
or
stream
out
of
the
gulf
joins
with
and
is
thrown
out
of
its
course
by
the
easterly
or
ebb
stream
setting
past
cape
fleming
arrival
at
the
port
a
breeze
springing
up
late
in
the
morning
we
beat
along
the
north
side
of
the
cobourg
peninsula
entering
port
essington
at
dusk
in
working
round
vashon
head
we
found
the
water
shoal
very
rapidly
to
and
fathoms
on
approaching
it
on
the
bearing
south
degrees
west
this
head
is
fronted
by
a
reef
of
some
extent
which
similar
to
the
other
at
the
entrance
of
port
essington
can
not
be
distinguished
owing
to
the
muddy
colour
of
the
water
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
the
lead
should
be
kept
constantly
going
when
in
its
vicinity
when
daylight
broke
we
found
no
fresh
arrival
to
greet
our
anxious
gaze
the
britomart
being
still
the
only
guardian
of
the
port
her
solitary
aspect
at
once
destroyed
our
hopes
of
supplies
and
on
reaching
the
settlement
our
fears
proved
to
have
too
much
foundation
hope
however
is
the
last
feeling
which
leaves
the
human
breast
and
in
this
instance
did
not
desert
us
as
there
was
still
a
chance
of
a
vessel
arriving
while
we
were
engaged
in
watering
the
ship
victoria
theatre
the
news
of
our
discovery
of
the
adelaide
was
hailed
with
infinite
satisfaction
and
the
numerous
speculations
and
ideas
on
the
subject
which
were
at
once
afloat
afforded
an
agreeable
variety
to
the
monotony
of
existence
in
the
settlement
where
however
at
the
moment
of
our
arrival
an
unusual
degree
of
excitement
prevailed
through
the
activity
of
captain
stanley
theatrical
amusements
ever
anxious
to
provide
for
the
amusement
of
others
he
had
been
for
some
time
engaged
in
getting
up
a
play
which
was
now
nearly
ready
to
be
performed
its
name
i
regret
to
have
forgotten
it
was
however
nothing
very
deep
and
was
selected
from
a
volume
that
had
already
performed
a
voyage
to
the
north
pole
this
adventurous
playbook
which
had
certainly
done
its
duty
was
originally
picked
up
by
its
owner
on
the
scenery
was
painted
by
captain
stanley
with
earths
of
the
country
who
also
was
stage
manager
and
general
planner
of
the
whole
the
wives
of
some
of
the
garrison
supplied
female
costumes
while
a
large
workshop
was
converted
into
a
theatre
at
length
after
the
difficulties
usually
attendant
on
private
theatricals
everything
was
in
readiness
for
the
first
performance
of
the
drama
in
northern
australia
tickets
were
issued
of
which
i
have
one
before
me
a
small
piece
of
card
containing
the
words
victoria
theatre
port
essington
august
in
after
years
this
will
be
looked
upon
as
a
curious
relic
in
connection
with
the
history
of
this
part
of
the
continent
as
if
to
cause
the
first
performance
of
a
play
at
victoria
to
take
place
under
smiling
auspices
such
as
the
occasion
properly
called
for
pelorus
arrived
with
supplies
and
letters
from
sydney
the
previous
growing
dearth
of
provisions
had
rendered
it
somewhat
difficult
to
secure
a
very
happily
disposed
audience
an
empty
stomach
being
apt
to
provoke
fault
finding
but
the
arrival
of
a
ship
on
the
very
play
day
caused
a
crowded
and
delighted
attendance
everything
went
off
smoothly
and
with
hearty
peals
of
laughter
all
the
characters
being
supported
by
men
the
female
personages
of
the
drama
presented
a
most
grotesque
appearance
moreover
the
act
drop
being
an
old
ensign
the
ladies
could
be
seen
through
it
regaling
themselves
during
these
intervals
with
a
pipe
the
whole
affair
gave
infinite
satisfaction
while
ours
was
greatly
enhanced
and
our
minds
prepared
for
any
duty
by
the
timely
arrival
of
supplies
and
letters
of
both
of
which
we
fortunately
received
our
share
our
departure
from
port
essington
was
not
therefore
hurried
and
i
had
some
slight
opportunity
of
adding
to
my
knowledge
with
regard
to
the
capabilities
of
the
place
which
were
found
to
grow
upon
acquaintance
the
fact
of
its
being
well
fitted
for
the
growth
of
cotton
was
in
particular
a
great
additional
recommendation
the
sallow
appearance
of
the
settlers
clearly
demonstrated
the
temperature
to
be
high
though
apparently
there
was
no
diminution
in
physical
strength
it
should
however
be
remembered
that
up
to
this
time
they
had
not
had
the
same
nourishment
as
those
who
appeared
amongst
them
as
transient
visitors
with
ruddy
faces
the
warmth
of
the
climate
in
itself
conduces
to
intemperance
which
to
europeans
is
ever
fatal
the
pelorus
brought
orders
for
the
britomart
to
proceed
to
sydney
passage
through
torres
strait
captain
stanley
was
anxious
with
the
westerly
monsoon
to
have
attempted
the
passage
through
torres
strait
instead
of
going
round
the
west
coast
as
such
a
course
might
have
led
to
some
discoveries
in
that
neighbourhood
a
result
always
in
such
a
service
of
the
utmost
importance
it
is
however
to
be
regretted
that
the
senior
officer
did
not
approve
of
this
plan
as
the
passage
has
only
once
been
made
from
the
westward
by
captain
lihou
who
having
experienced
some
difficulties
reported
unfavourably
of
it
the
importance
of
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
this
route
will
be
better
appreciated
when
we
reflect
that
ultimately
through
this
passage
will
the
great
traffic
be
carried
on
between
our
east
indian
and
australian
possessions
during
our
visit
to
port
essington
some
of
the
changes
among
our
officers
mentioned
in
the
beginning
of
the
work
took
place
forsyth
joined
us
from
the
pelorus
and
from
his
knowledge
of
surveying
was
a
valuable
addition
to
our
party
sketch
of
victoria
having
said
so
much
in
relation
to
port
essington
on
our
former
visit
and
wishing
to
create
among
our
readers
an
interest
in
the
locality
we
give
a
slight
sketch
of
the
appearance
of
the
settlement
from
the
anchorage
which
will
be
more
effective
than
our
most
elaborate
description
of
it
evil
example
of
convicts
before
taking
leave
of
this
new
colony
we
must
at
once
express
a
hope
that
it
will
not
be
made
a
penal
settlement
not
that
we
doubt
the
wonderful
degree
in
which
the
convict
system
has
hastened
the
prosperity
of
our
possessions
on
the
part
of
the
continent
but
from
the
proximity
of
northern
australia
to
the
islands
in
the
arafura
sea
the
waters
separating
them
being
often
navigable
for
boats
the
natives
would
be
contaminated
and
vitiated
their
women
corrupted
and
the
badly
disposed
among
the
islanders
rendered
worse
and
instead
of
our
advent
bringing
with
it
the
light
of
the
gospel
and
the
real
and
substantial
blessings
of
civilization
we
should
enjoy
the
unenviable
privilege
of
still
further
degenerating
the
savage
the
evil
thus
caused
in
new
zealand
has
been
incalculable
to
the
bad
example
of
convicts
we
owe
much
of
the
ills
which
have
there
arisen
the
fine
fearless
bearing
of
the
wild
man
has
been
partially
exchanged
for
the
low
cunning
acquired
from
the
runaway
felon
who
reckless
of
his
own
life
can
have
no
regard
for
that
of
others
the
worst
crimes
of
the
dregs
of
a
civilized
population
have
been
introduced
and
many
of
those
wretched
beings
who
might
otherwise
have
been
reclaimed
from
the
rude
vices
of
savage
life
have
through
the
white
man
instrumentality
perished
in
sin
i
knew
an
instance
of
a
convict
who
when
dying
actually
picked
a
man
pocket
the
ruling
passion
strong
in
death
was
here
painfully
exemplified
the
number
of
malay
proas
that
visit
this
part
of
the
continent
would
also
furnish
facilities
for
the
escape
of
convicts
from
the
neighbourhood
of

we

in

from

we
sailed
from
port
essington
on
the
march
having
on
board
captain
kuper
then
lieutenant
of
alligator
and
one
of
the
australian
natives
who
was
induced
to
accompany
us
partly
by
his
own
curiosity
and
partly
by
liberal
promises
and
plenty
to
eat
he
was
known
at
the
settlement
by
the
name
of
jack
white
and
from
his
great
good
humour
and
intelligence
was
a
favourite
with
everyone
i
hoped
by
keeping
him
on
board
for
some
time
away
from
his
tribe
to
wean
him
in
some
degree
from
his
savage
habits
and
that
by
being
able
to
communicate
with
him
with
greater
facility
we
might
learn
more
of
the
manners
and
customs
of
his
countrymen
than
we
had
yet
been
able
to
do
in
addition
to
which
we
anticipated
no
small
amusement
from
witnessing
his
astonishment
at
seeing
countries
and
people
so
different
from
his
own
light
airs
prevented
our
clearing
the
harbour
till
the
morning
of
the
and
at
on
the
we
made
the
land
of
timor
laut
but
from
our
ignorance
of
the
coast
we
were
obliged
to
keep
under
easy
sail
during
the
night
which
was
squally
with
heavy
rain
timor
laut
proas
at
daylight
on
the
we
made
all
sail
to
the
northward
and
about
observed
two
large
proas
with
dutch
colours
flying
standing
out
from
the
land
under
sail
they
were
full
of
men
and
for
some
time
appeared
to
be
in
great
doubt
whether
they
should
come
near
us
or
not
as
they
shortened
sail
and
consulted
together
several
times
at
last
however
they
came
under
our
stern
which
was
the
only
way
in
which
they
could
approach
as
their
long
outriggers
projecting
or
feet
on
each
side
of
their
narrow
canoes
prevented
them
from
coming
close
alongside
as
soon
as
they
got
hold
of
the
rope
we
gave
them
they
hauled
close
up
and
a
little
thin
shrivelled
old
man
came
scrambling
over
the
taffrail
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
black
serge
coat
check
shirt
and
black
trousers
and
as
soon
as
he
had
regained
his
breath
after
the
violent
exertions
he
had
made
presented
me
with
a
neat
little
basket
containing
some
papers
which
he
seemed
very
anxious
i
should
examine
i
took
them
up
rather
to
please
him
than
with
any
expectation
of
being
able
to
understand
them
but
to
my
surprise
and
great
interest
found
carefully
rolled
up
in
several
envelopes
two
pieces
of
lead
pencil
part
of
the
leaf
of
a
norie
navigation
tables
and
some
scraps
of
paper
on
which
written
in
pencil
was
a
rough
journal
of
the
proceedings
of
the
men
who
left
the
charles
eaton
soon
after
she
was
wrecked
in
torres
strait
in
one
of
her
cutters
in
which
they
reached
this
island
and
after
remaining
for
thirteen
months
got
to
amboyna

thence
to

the

at
the
entrance

proceedings
of
the

during
the
preceding
night
the
captain
as
a
measure
of
prudence
had
ordered
the
first
reef
to
be
taken
in
the
topsails
in
order
not
to
enter
the
passage
before
daylight
the
ship
struck
on
the
reef
so
violently
that
both
keel
and
rudder
were
instantly
knocked
off
and
carried
away
and
the
captain
declared
the

to
be
totally

risk
of
their

the

were
knocked
to
pieces
and
lost
by
the
vessel
falling
over
on
her
side
and
they
were
unable
to
save
any
more
of
the
passengers
or
crew
as
it
was
impossible
to
pull
the
boat
up
against
the
strong
current
and
none
of
them
would
venture
amidst
the
heavy
breakers

they
were
unable

the
next

not

on

concluded

had
been
washed
off
by

increasing

they
left

steered
as
westerly
a
course
as
possible
by
the
sun
and
stars
they
had
no
compass
in
order
to
reach
the
dutch
settlement
of
coupang
in
the
island
of
timor
the
whole
of
their
provisions
consisted
of
pounds
of
bread
one
ham
and
a
keg
containing
about
four
gallons
of
water
which
had
been
placed
in

was
lowered
the

after
driving
about
for
fifteen
days
on

ocean
they
descried
land
which
they
took
to
be
timor
they
went
on
shore
and
procured
some
water
and
coconuts
but
afterwards
pursuing
their
course
along
the
coast
they
were
attacked
by
a
number
of
native
proas
and
being
warn
out
with
fatigue
and
without
any
arms
to
defend
themselves
they
were
forced
to
surrender
the
natives
upset
the
boat
and
stripped
them
of
all
their
clothes
after
which
they
were
brought
on
shore
where
the
natives
at
first
seemed
inclined
to
kill
them
but
through
the
intercession
of
two
chiefs
named
pabok
and
lomba
their
lives
were
spared
they
afterwards
learnt
that
they
were
at
the
native
village
of
oliliet
in
the
island
of
timor
laut
part
of
their
clothes
were
given
back
to
them
and
they
were
well
treated
without
being
compelled
by
the
natives
to
perform
any
labour
their
sustenance
consisted
of
indian
corn
yams
a
little
rice
and
some
fish
but
the
quantities
given
them
were
only
just
sufficient
to
keep
them
alive
during
their
abode
in
this
island
they
learnt
that
in
one
of
the
neighbouring
settlements
called
laouran
at
that
period
at
war
with
the
one
in
which
they
lived
there
was
another
european
formerly
belonging
to
an
english
brig
that
had
been
wrecked
seven
years
ago
and
of
whose
crew
he
and
a
boy
since
dead
had
alone
been
spared
by
their
savage
captors
after
remaining
more
than
thirteen
months
at
oliliet
a
trading
proa
arrived
from
amboyna
in
which
they
received
permission
to
depart
promising
to
return
soon
in
an
english
ship
with
arms
and
ammunition
to
assist
the
chiefs
in
defeating
their
enemies
in
this
proa
after
a
passage
of
five
days
they
arrived
at
amboyna
on
the
of
october
ireland
account
of
the
fate
of
the
crew
of
the
melancholy
fate
of
those
who
remained
on
the
wreck
the
boy
ireland
gave
the
following
account
which
was
published
at
sydney
by
captain
king
ireland
and
the
younger
were
rescued
from
the
savages
by
captain
lewis
of
the
colonial
schooner
isabella
who
was
sent
to
look
for
them
in
consequence
of
captain
carr
of
the
ship
having
reported
that
he
had
seen
two
white
persons
among
the
natives
of
murray
island
but
had
been
unable
to
induce
the
natives
to
give
them
up
i
afterwards
met
captain
carr
in
the
mangles
he
expressed
great
regret
that
so
much
blame
should
have
been
attached
to
him
for
not
bringing
away
the
children
his
account
differed
very
much
from
young
ireland
and
it
is
but
justice
to
him
to
state
that
it
was
owing
to
his
report
that
the
vessels
were
sent
in
search
of
ireland
and
young
the
charles
eaton
left
sydney
on
the
of
july
bound
to
canton
by
way
of
torres
strait
and
experienced
a
series
of
fine
weather
and
favourable
winds
until
she
approached
the
barrier
reef
when
the
weather
became
thick
and
rainy
the
master
was
provided
with
captain
ashmore
chart
guided
by
which
he
boldly
steered
for
the
reefs
unfortunately
however
for
him
the
weather
was
so
clouded
on
approaching
the
barriers
that
he
could
obtain
no
observation
for
the
latitude
and
yet
it
would
appear
that
the
ship
was
in
a
very
favourable
position
about
ten
in
the
morning
the
reefs
were
suddenly
perceived
right
ahead
upon
which
the
ship
was
hove
up
in
the
wind
and
both
anchors
let
go
and
the
cables
paid
out
to
the
end
but
as
the
depth
was
probably
unfathomable
they
had
no
effect
for
she
drifted
on
the
reef
and
fell
over
on
her
beam
ends
the
chief
mate
then
cut
her
masts
away
but
the
bottom
was
soon
bilged
and
everything
destroyed
by
the
water
which
broke
over
the
decks
and
the
ship
became
a
perfect
wreck
happily
the
upper
part
of
the
vessel
kept
together
on
which
the
crew
and
passengers
collected
soon
after
she
struck
a
vessel
was
observed
three
or
four
miles
to
windward
high
and
dry
upon
the
reefs
with
her
masts
standing
and
royal
yards
across
and
sails
set
in
which
position
she
must
have
been
left
by
her
crew
the
flora
sheriff
master
during
the
confusion
that
existed
one
of
the
was
lowered
but
immediately
swamped
by
which
one
man
named
price
was
drowned
soon
afterwards
three
of
the
crew
namely
pigott
the
third
mate
constantine
the
carpenter
and
gumble
one
of
the
seamen
put
sails
provisions
and
water
and
arms
and
all
the
carpenter
tools
into
the
other
and
lowered
her
down
and
kept
near
the
wreck
during
the
day
and
following
night
the
next
day
quin
and
wright
two
seamen
joined
them
after
which
they
refused
to
take
any
more
although
six
of
the
crew
made
their
way
over
the
reef
the
next
morning
and
wished
to
be
taken
on
board
the
boat
however
bore
away
and
was
seen
no
more
the
master
then
assisted
by
those
who
remained
attempted
to
make
a
raft
which
was
not
completed
before
the
expiration
of
seven
days
during
this
interval
they
had
managed
to
distil
the
contents
of
a
cask
and
some
bottles
of
water
from
the
sea
by
the
aid
of
the
ship
coppers
and
a
leaden
pipe
from
the
quarter
gallery
cistern
the
whole
of
which
they
placed
on
the
raft
with
a
basket
containing
beer
and
a
cask
of
pork
whilst
they
were
on
the
wreck
they
were
upon
a
daily
allowance
of
two
wine
glasses
of
distilled
water
and
a
few
pieces
of
damaged
biscuit
as
soon
as
the
raft
was
completed
they
got
upon
it
but
finding
that
it
was
not
buoyant
enough
to
hold
them
they
threw
over
the
water
the
pork
and
beer
still
it
did
not
support
their
weight
so
the
greater
number
returned
on
board
leaving
moore
the
master
grant
the
surgeon
captain
and
and
their
two
children
their
nurse
a
native
of
india
and
armstrong
passengers
also
two
seamen
named
lounce
and
berry
who
determined
to
remain
upon
it
all
night
in
the
morning
however
it
was
found
that
the
rope
by
which
the
raft
had
been
made
fast
to
the
stern
of
the
wreck
had
been
cut
and
nothing
was
seen
of
their
companions
it
is
probable
that
the
uncomfortable
situation
in
which
they
found
themselves
up
to
their
waists
in
water
and
the
sea
constantly
breaching
over
them
induced
the
master
to
cut
the
rope
and
trust
to
providence
to
guide
himself
and
the
passengers
to
some
place
of
safety
those
that
remained
then
made
another
raft
of
the
vessel
topmasts
lashed
together
with
coir
rope
and
made
a
sail
out
of
some
cloth
which
formed
a
part
of
her
cargo
it
took
seven
days
before
it
was
completed
when
they
launched
off
and
bid
adieu
to
the
vessel
which
was
probably
soon
broken
up
for
at
the
sea
breached
over
her
the
vessel
that
was
seen
with
her
masts
standing
was
too
far
to
windward
for
them
to
reach
for
even
the
boat
could
not
make
way
against
the
wind
and
current
upon
casting
off
they
set
their
sail
and
steered
before
the
wind
but
the
raft
was
so
heavy
and
deep
that
very
little
progress
was
made
she
drifted
rather
than
sailed
and
probably
did
not
go
more
than
a
mile
or
one
mile
and
a
half
an
hour
after
some
time
they
came
to
a
reef
upon
which
they
remained
for
the
night
and
the
next
morning
proceeded
before
the
wind
but
saw
no
more
reefs
after
being
two
days
and
nights
upon
the
raft
up
to
their
waists
in
water
and
partaken
of
very
little
food
they
passed
an
island
and
then
saw
several
more
ahead
soon
afterwards
a
canoe
was
perceived
paddling
towards
them
containing
ten
or
twelve
indians
who
as
they
approached
stood
up
and
extended
their
arms
to
show
they
had
no
weapons
and
were
inclined
to
be
friendly
on
reaching
the
raft
the
indians
got
upon
it
and
conducted
themselves
very
peaceably
and
after
a
short
time
proposed
that
they
should
leave
the
raft
and
go
into
the
canoe
which
they
at
first
hesitated
to
do
until
thomas
ching
a
midshipman
said
he
would
go
as
he
should
then
have
a
better
chance
of
getting
to
england
upon
which
they
all
consented
and
embarked
in
the
canoe
before
they
left
the
indians
searched
the
raft
very
narrowly
for
iron
implements
but
only
found
a
few
hoops
which
they
collected
and
took
with
them
they
left
the
raft
about
four
in
the
afternoon
and
in
less
than
an
hour
were
landed
on
an
island
which
they
subsequently
found
was
called
boydan
and
which
is
probably
that
on
the
chart
called
number
to
the
eastward
of
hannibal
island
on
their
way
to
it
the
canoe
passed
first
three
islands
on
the
right
northward
and
one
on
the
left
southward
the
mainland
was
also
distinguished
from
boydan
island
and
appeared
to
be
about
twelve
or
fourteen
miles
off
which
agrees
very
well
with
the
island
it
is
supposed
to
be
upon
disembarking
the
natives
accompanied
them
round
the
island
in
search
of
food
and
water
but
they
were
so
exhausted
by
fatigue
and
hunger
that
they
could
scarcely
crawl
upon
their
return
to
the
place
where
they
landed
they
threw
themselves
on
the
ground
in
despair
as
it
was
evident
from
the
ferocious
bearing
and
conduct
of
the
savages
who
stood
around
their
party
grinning
and
laughing
in
the
most
hideous
manner
that
they
were
exulting
in
the
anticipation
of
their
murderous
intentions
in
this
dreadful
state
of
suspense
clare
the
first
officer
addressing
his
companions
recommended
them
to
be
resigned
to
their
fate
and
read
to
them
in
a
most
impressive
manner
several
prayers
from
a
book
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
the
wreck
after
which
commending
themselves
to
the
protection
of
the
almighty
they
laid
down
and
worn
out
by
severe
exhaustion
were
soon
asleep
but
it
was
to
them
the
sleep
of
death
for
no
sooner
had
they
composed
themselves
than
as
ireland
describes
he
was
roused
by
a
shout
and
noise
and
upon
looking
up
saw
the
indians
murdering
his
companions
by
dashing
their
brains
out
with
clubs
the
first
that
was
killed
was
poor
ching
and
after
him
his
companion
perry
and
then
mayer
the
second
officer
after
which
the
confusion
became
so
great
that
ireland
could
not
distinguish
what
passed
the
last
however
that
met
his
fate
was
clare
who
in
the
attempt
to
make
his
escape
to
the
canoe
was
overtaken
by
his
pursuers
and
immediately
despatched
by
a
blow
on
the
head
ireland
and
another
boy
named
sexton
were
now
left
awaiting
their
fate
the
former
the
narrator
of
this
melancholy
tale
thus
describes
his
deliverance
an
indian
came
to
me
with
a
carving
knife
to
cut
my
throat
but
as
he
was
about
to
do
it
having
seized
hold
of
me
i
grasped
the
blade
of
the
knife
in
my
right
hand
and
held
it
fast
struggling
for
my
life
the
indian
then
threw
me
down
and
placing
his
knee
on
my
breast
tried
to
wrench
the
knife
out
of
my
hand
but
i
still
retained
it
although
one
of
my
fingers
was
cut
through
to
the
bone
at
last
i
succeeded
in
getting
uppermost
when
i
let
him
go
and
ran
into
the
sea
and
swam
out
but
being
much
exhausted
and
the
only
chance
of
my
life
was
to
return
to
the
shore
i
landed
again
fully
expecting
to
be
knocked
on
the
head
the
same
indian
then
came
up
with
an
infuriated
gesture
and
shot
me
in
the
right
breast
with
an
arrow
and
then
in
a
most
unaccountable
manner
suddenly
became
quite
calm
and
led
or
dragged
me
to
a
little
distance
and
offered
me
some
fish
and
water
which
i
was
unable
to
partake
of
whilst
struggling
with
the
indian
i
observed
sexton
who
was
held
by
another
bite
a
piece
of
his
arm
out
but
after
that
knew
nothing
of
him
until
i
found
his
life
had
been
spared
in
a
manner
similar
to
my
own
upon
interrogating
ireland
to
obtain
some
explanation
of
the
reason
their
lives
were
spared
he
says
that
he
has
frequently
seen
the
indians
recover
themselves
in
a
moment
from
a
violent
paroxysm
of
fury
and
he
attributes
their
safety
to
a
circumstance
of
this
nature
at
a
short
distance
off
making
the
most
hideous
yells
the
other
savages
were
dancing
round
a
large
fire
before
which
were
placed
in
a
row
the
heads
of
their
victims
whilst
their
decapitated
bodies
were
washing
in
the
surf
on
the
beach
from
which
they
soon
disappeared
having
been
probably
washed
away
by
the
tide
sexton
and
i
were
then
placed
in
charge
of
two
natives
who
covered
us
with
the
sail
of
the
canoe
a
sort
of
mat
but
paid
no
attention
to
my
wound
which
had
been
bleeding
profusely
the
next
day
the
indians
collected
all
the
heads
and
embarking
removed
to
another
island
where
the
women
lived
which
they
called
pullan
on
landing
there
ireland
saw
two
of
captain
children
and
the
ship
dog
called
portland
the
elder
george
told
him
that
the
first
raft
had
landed
on
the
island
and
that
all
the
passengers
excepting
himself
and
his
brother
had
been
instantly
murdered
that
his
mother
was
killed
by
a
blow
with
a
club
and
that
his
little
brother
was
in
her
arms
at
the
time
but
was
saved
by
one
of
the
women
who
afterwards
took
care
of
him
the
child
was
seen
by
ireland
when
they
landed
in
the
woman
arms
crying
very
much
he
also
saw
some
pieces
of
the
ship
cabin
doors
attached
as
ornaments
to
the
heads
of
their
canoes
which
they
appeared
to
prize
very
much
and
other
relics
among
which
were
the
heads
of
the
passengers
and
crew
of
the
first
raft
those
of
and
captain
moore
being
plainly
distinguishable
the
former
by
the
hair
the
latter
by
the
features
the
heads
were
suspended
by
a
rope
to
a
pole
that
was
stuck
up
near
the
huts
of
the
women
round
which
they
danced
every
night
and
morning
accompanying
their
infuriated
gestures
with
the
most
horrid
yells
the
number
of
indians
collected
amounted
to
about
sixty
they
were
merely
residing
on
the
island
during
the
fishing
season
for
their
home
as
it
afterwards
turned
out
was
at
a
considerable
distance
off
their
principal
subsistence
was
turtle
and
small
fish
which
they
caught
with
hook
and
line
and
shellfish
which
abound
on
the
reefs
the
island
also
produces
a
small
fruit
like
a
plum
with
a
stone
in
it
probably
a
species
of
eugenia
the
fish
were
broiled
over
the
ashes
of
a
fire
or
boiled
in
the
basin
of
a
large
volute
voluta
ethiopica
which
being
rather
a
scarce
shell
is
of
great
value
to
them
the
island
of
pullan
is
covered
with
low
trees
and
underwood
and
the
soil
is
sandy
in
the
centre
of
it
is
a
spring
which
supplied
the
whole
party
with
sufficient
water
for
their
consumption
and
as
ireland
says
they
used
a
great
deal
it
must
at
least
have
yielded
fifteen
or
twenty
gallons
a
day
for
the
hole
was
always
full
upon
a
voyage
they
carry
their
water
in
bamboo
joints
and
coconut
shells
as
do
the
malays
after
remaining
here
two
months
the
indians
separated
one
party
taking
ireland
and
the
infant
with
them
embarked
in
a
canoe
and
after
half
a
day
sail
reached
another
islet
to
the
northward
where
they
remained
a
day
and
a
night
on
a
sandy
beach
and
the
next
morning
proceeded
and
reached
another
island
similar
to
pullan
low
and
bushy
where
they
remained
a
fortnight
they
then
proceeded
to
the
northward
calling
on
their
way
at
different
islands
and
remaining
as
long
as
they
supplied
food
until
they
reached
one
where
they
remained
a
month
and
then
they
went
on
a
visit
to
darnley
island
which
they
called
aroob
where
for
the
first
time
ireland
says
he
met
with
kind
treatment
probably
one
of
the
group
of
the
northward
of
halfway
island
near
aureed
named
by
lewis
sir
richard
bourke
group
after
a
fortnight
they
again
embarked
and
returned
by
the
way
they
came
to
an
island
they
called
situated
near
aureed
where
their
voyage
ended
and
they
remained
until
purchased
by
duppar
the
murray
islander
who
it
appears
upon
hearing
that
there
were
two
white
boys
in
captivity
at
aureed
embarked
in
a
canoe
with
his
wife
pamoy
and
went
for
the
express
purpose
of
obtaining
them
taking
for
the
purpose
of
barter
some
fruit
the
price
of
their
ransom
was
a
branch
of
bananas
for
each
they
returned
by
way
of
darnley
island
where
they
stopped
a
few
days
and
then
reached
murray
island
where
they
remained
ever
since
and
were
most
kindly
treated
duppar
gave
little
to
a
native
named
oby
to
take
care
of
a
charge
of
which
he
faithfully
acquitted
himself
and
both
oby
and
his
adopted
child
soon
became
very
fond
of
each
other
for
as
the
child
was
a
mere
infant
he
soon
forgot
his
mother
and
naturally
attached
himself
to
his
nurse
when
at
aureed
the
indians
had
named
ireland
wak
and
little
they
called
uass
names
which
they
retained
at
murray
island
and
by
which
they
are
doubtless
now
known
all
over
the
archipelago
according
to
ireland
information
is
marsden
island
ireland
lived
in
the
same
hut
with
duppar
and
his
family
his
employment
was
to
cultivate
a
plantation
of
yams
and
during
the
season
to
assist
in
taking
turtle
and
shellfish
on
one
occasion
he
accompanied
them
on
an
excursion
towards
new
guinea
where
they
went
for
the
purpose
of
barter
and
trade
which
they
frequently
did
to
obtain
bows
and
arrows
canoes
and
feathers
for
which
they
give
in
return
shells
and
which
from
their
scarcity
the
new
guinea
people
prize
very
much
but
as
duppar
was
fearful
that
the
new
guinea
people
would
steal
or
murder
him
he
was
left
at
darnley
island
in
charge
of
agge
an
indian
until
their
return
duppar
and
his
friends
however
were
not
long
away
for
having
stopped
at
an
island
jarmuth
campbell
island
to
pass
the
night
one
of
the
islanders
attempted
to
take
away
by
force
from
one
of
the
visitors
his
moco
moco
a
sort
of
bandage
worn
round
the
calves
of
the
legs
made
of
the
bark
of
bamboo
upon
which
a
quarrel
ensued
in
which
the
murray
islanders
used
their
bows
and
arrows
and
wounded
several
one
being
shot
through
the
body
the
jarmuth
people
then
retreated
to
their
huts
and
the
others
embarked
but
instead
of
going
to
new
guinea
returned
to
darnley
island
where
in
a
few
days
they
received
a
message
from
jarmuth
offering
peace
which
however
they
would
not
accept
nor
did
they
afterwards
make
friends
ireland
describes
the
shell
to
be
a
cone
and
recognized
it
among
the
plates
in
the
encyclopedie
methodique
as
the
conusmille
punctatus
ireland
account
of
the
visit
of
the
mangles
is
so
different
from
what
captain
carr
describes
that
the
discrepancy
must
be
received
with
much
caution
he
states
that
captain
carr
object
seemed
to
be
entirely
that
of
trading
for
he
was
alongside
the
mangles
and
not
at
a
considerable
distance
off
he
was
so
near
as
to
ask
one
of
the
people
on
the
poop
to
throw
him
a
rope
to
get
fast
to
the
vessel
which
was
done
but
owing
to
the
sea
running
high
he
was
obliged
to
let
it
go
upon
which
he
asked
for
a
boat
to
be
lowered
for
him
to
get
on
board
which
was
also
done
and
he
should
have
made
his
escape
had
not
one
stood
up
in
the
bow
with
a
naked
cutlass
and
the
others
flourished
their
weapons
over
their
heads
which
frightened
the
indians
so
much
that
they
pulled
away
on
shore
followed
by
the
boat
for
a
little
distance
and
there
concealed
him
ireland
declares
that
he
did
not
say
that
the
natives
would
not
give
him
up
when
under
the
mangles
stern
one
of
the
crew
offered
him
some
tobacco
which
he
declined
had
captain
carr
offered
an
axe
for
him
he
would
have
been
given
up
immediately
as
well
as
little
who
was
on
the
beach
in
the
arms
of
one
of
the
natives
the
natives
knew
that
ireland
was
anxious
to
be
taken
away
and
were
averse
to
his
going
off
to
the
vessel
saying
you
shall
not
go
there
to
be
killed
but
as
he
hoped
to
make
his
escape
he
persisted
and
the
result
was
a
bitter
disappointment
to
him
such
is
the
succinct
narrative
of
which
old
lomba
offered
me
the
first
rude
materials
the
chief
lomba
as
soon
as
i
had
read
the
papers
contained
in
the
basket
i
endeavoured
by
the
help
of
the
malay
dictionary
to
gain
some
more
information
from
the
old
man
and
after
some
time
succeeded
in
making
out
that
he
was
the
chief
lomba
mentioned
by
the
seamen
in
their
narrative
which
was
confirmed
by
finding
that
the
shirt
he
wore
was
marked
with
the
name
of
the
unfortunate
midshipman
ching
who
so
early
fell
a
victim
to
the
murderous
savages
on
the
reef
from
our
ignorance
of
the
language
i
was
unable
to
gain
any
information
of
the
european
boy
said
to
be
still
on
the
island
lomba
pointed
out
the
village
he
came
from
prettily
situated
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
should
there
find
the
other
chief
pabok
who
was
too
old
and
infirm
to
come
down
upon
which
i
determined
to
remain
for
the
night
in
order
to
visit
the
village
in
hopes
of
getting
some
more
information
and
also
to
make
pabok
a
present
which
he
well
deserved
for
his
good
services
the
gig
was
accordingly
sent
inshore
to
sound
and
soon
made
the
signal
of
having
found
an
anchorage
upon
which
we
stood
in
greatly
to
the
delight
of
the
natives
who
as
they
were
not
armed
were
allowed
to
come
on
board
where
they
behaved
very
well
some
went
aloft
with
great
activity
to
assist
in
furling
sails
and
two
came
aft
to
the
wheel
the
use
of
which
they
seemed
to
understand
perfectly
at
one
we
anchored
in
fathoms
sand
and
coral
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
the
shore
and
as
soon
as
the
ship
was
secured
a
party
of
us
landed
accompanied
by
the
old
chief
and
followed
by
most
of
the
natives
in
their
canoes
appearance
of
the
shores
on
landing
the
contrast
to
the
australian
shores
we
had
so
recently
sailed
from
was
very
striking
we
left
a
land
covered
with
the
monotonous
interminable
forest
of
the
eucalyptus
or
gumtree
which
from
the
peculiar
structure
of
its
leaf
affords
but
little
shelter
from
the
tropical
sun
shores
fringed
with
impenetrable
mangroves
a
soil
producing
scarcely
any
indigenous
vegetable
either
in
the
shape
of
root
or
fruit
fit
for
food
the
natives
black
naked
lowest
in
the
scale
of
civilized
life
their
dwellings
if
such
they
can
be
called
formed
by
spreading
the
bark
rudely
torn
from
the
tree
over
a
few
twigs
placed
in
the
ground
under
which
they
creep
for
shelter
dependent
almost
entirely
on
the
success
of
the
chase
for
their
daily
food
not
having
arrived
at
the
first
and
simplest
form
of
cultivation
and
in
like
manner
destitute
of
all
trace
of
religion
except
the
faint
symptom
of
belief
in
an
evil
spirit
we
landed
on
a
beach
along
which
a
luxuriant
grove
of
coconut
trees
extended
for
more
than
a
mile
under
the
shade
of
which
were
sheds
neatly
constructed
of
bamboo
and
thatched
with
palm
leaves
for
the
reception
of
their
canoes
to
our
right
a
hill
rose
to
a
height
of
about
feet
covered
with
brilliant
and
varied
vegetation
so
luxuriant
as
entirely
to
conceal
the
village
built
on
its
summit
the
natives
who
thronged
the
beach
were
of
a
light
tawny
colour
mostly
fine
athletic
men
with
an
intelligent
expression
of
countenance
dress
of
the
natives
their
dress
consisted
of
a
cloth
round
the
waist
reaching
to
the
knee
which
in
some
instances
was
neatly
ornamented
with
small
white
shells
their
arms
and
ankles
were
loaded
with
rings
formed
of
ebony
ivory
and
coloured
glass
some
of
the
former
bore
evident
marks
of
having
been
turned
in
a
lathe
the
lobes
of
their
ears
were
perforated
with
large
holes
from
which
enormous
earrings
of
ivory
and
ebony
in
the
shape
of
padlocks
were
suspended
sometimes
as
many
as
three
from
one
ear
a
few
of
the
natives
had
gold
earrings
of
considerable
size
but
rude
workmanship
the
boys
and
younger
men
had
their
hair
cut
short
and
their
heads
smeared
over
with
a
preparation
of
lime
which

soon
as

in

some
specimens

which
were
very
large
and
of
such
superior
manufacture
as
to
indicate
an
intercourse
with
much
more
civilized
nations
leprosy
the
natives
appeared
to
be
healthy
with
the
exception
of
a
sort
of
leprosy
from
which
many
of
them
were
suffering
it
gave
them
a
most
disgusting
appearance
but
did
not
appear
to
cause
any
inconvenience
nor
were
they
avoided
by
the
rest
of
their
companions
as
if
the
disease
had
been
contagious
on
our
first
landing
very
few
of
the
natives
had
any
arms
but
they
afterwards
brought
down
some
bows
and
arrows
some
of
which
were
four
or
five
feet
long
neatly
headed
with
iron
we
also
saw
a
few
spears
a
few
cresses
and
some
hatchets
of
a
very
rude
construction
canoes
their
canoes
about
thirty
of
which
were
hauled
upon
the
beach
were
from
to
thirty
feet
long
and
very
narrow
with
outriggers
projecting
ten
or
twelve
feet
from
each
side
and
supporting
a
piece
of
buoyant
wood
to
give
stability
they
carried
one
large
but
did
not
appear
to
sail
fast
as
soon
as
we
had
satisfied
our
curiosity
on
the
beach
old
lomba
led
the
way
to
the
village
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
the
ascent
commenced
close
to
the
landing
place
by
a
flight
of
steps
rudely
formed
by
logs
of
wood
laid
across
a
narrow
path
cut
in
the
hillside
which
brought
us
to
within
forty
or
fifty
feet
of
the
summit
after
which
we
had
to
climb
two
ladders
made
of
hard
red
wood
richly
carved
placed
almost
perpendicularly
against
the
cliff
in
a
recess
under
the
upper
step
we
noticed
four
small
idols
that
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
those
of
the
south
sea
islanders
village
of
oliliet
after
reaching
the
top
of
the
ladder
we
passed
through
a
gateway
evidently
intended
for
defence
and
then
found
ourselves
in
the
village
of
oliliet
built
on
a
level
space
of
considerable
extent
accessible
only
from
seaward
by
the
path
we
had
ascended
which
the
removal
of
the
ladders
would
render
impracticable
and
on
the
land
side
protected
by
a
wall
beyond
which
the
jungle
appeared
to
be
very
dense
the
houses
all
raised
on
piles
six
or
eight
feet
above
the
ground
could
only
be
entered
by
means
of
a
ladder
leading
through
a
trapdoor
in
the
floor
the
roofs
neatly
thatched
with
palm
leaves
and
formed
with
a
very
steep
pitch
projected
considerably
beyond
the
low
and
surmounted
at
the
gables
by
large
wooden
horns
richly
carved
from
which
long
strings
of
shells
hung
down
to
the
ground
giving
the
village
a
most
picturesque
appearance
see
the
view
annexed
the
houses
were
arranged
with
considerable
regularity
so
as
to
form
one
wide
street
of
considerable
extent
from
which
narrow
alleys
branched
on
each
side
our
conductor
led
us
to
the
oran
kaya
whom
we
found
seated
in
front
of
a
small
house
in
the
widest
part
of
the
street
opposite
to
which
there
was
a
circular
space
marked
out
by
a
row
of
stones
placed
on
the
ground
and
which
appeared
to
be
set
aside
for
religious
purposes
as
they
seemed
unwilling
we
should
set
foot
within
it
here
the
natives
soon
afterwards
assembled
in
considerable
numbers
and
were
for
some
time
engaged
in
serious
discussion
oran
kaya
and
pabok
the
oran
kaya
who
was
an
elderly
man
received
us
very
civilly
and
invited
us
to
sit
down
beside
him
soon
afterwards
pabok
came
up
he
was
very
old
had
lost
the
sight
of
one
eye
and
wore
an
old
straw
hat
of
european
manufacture
decorated
with
stripes
of
red
and
blue
cloth
sewn
round
it
i
tried
in
vain
to
get
more
information
from
him
about
the
european
boy
and
on
pressing
him
to
come
down
to
the
boat
to
receive
a
present
he
made
signs
he
was
too
old
to
do
so
after
remaining
a
short
time
in
the
village
during
which
one
of
our
party
caught
a
transient
glimpse
of
some
of
the
women
we
returned
to
the
beach
where
we
found
that
the
natives
had
brought
a
plentiful
supply
of
coconuts
and
they
promised
to
bring
some
other
supplies
off
in
the
morning
departure
from
oliliet
at
sunset
the
natives
all
went
quietly
away
and
we
returned
on
board
passing
on
our
way
some
small
rocky
islands
which
appeared
to
be
used
as
burial
places
and
emitted
an
intolerable
stench
the
bodies
were
placed
in
rude
wooden
boxes
open
at
the
top
and
quite
exposed
to
the
air
from
one
small
rock
not
large
enough
to
hold
a
body
there
was
a
long
bamboo
erected
from
which
a
human
hand
blackened
by
exposure
to
the
sun
was
suspended
on
the
soon
after
daylight
the
natives
came
off
bringing
with
them
indian
corn
and
coconuts
in
such
quantities
that
they
sold
the
latter
for
a
couple
of
pins
each
they
also
brought
yams
bananas
fowls
chilies
etc
but
they
did
not
seem
inclined
to
part
with
them
for
anything
we
could
offer
except
gunpowder
which
i
would
not
allow
to
be
given
as
barter
at
nine
finding
we
could
get
no
more
information
from
them
we
weighed
the
natives
all
left
us
very
quietly
as
soon
as
the
capstan
was
manned
and
by
signs
appeared
to
wish
us
to
revisit
them
during
the
whole
time
they
were
on
board
they
behaved
perfectly
well
and
did
not
make
any
attempt
at
stealing
though
they
must
have
seen
many
things
most
valuable
to
them
which
they
might
easily
have
taken
from
what
we
saw
of
oliliet
it
does
not
appear
to
be
a
place
from
which
any
quantity
of
sea
stock
can
be
procured
for
although
they
had
plenty
of
pigs
and
fowls
in
the
village
they
did
not
seem
at
all
inclined
to
part
with
them
water
may
be
procured
on
the
beach
but
a
merchant
vessel
should
be
very
cautious
in
sending
her
boats
for
it
as
the
crew
being
necessarily
divided
would
easily
fall
victims
to
any
treacherous
attack
on
the
part
of
the
natives
and
from
all
we
subsequently
learnt
of
them
from
the
traders
we
met
at
arru
they
are
not
always
to
be
trusted
after
clearing
the
bay
we
stood
to
the
northward
along
the
east
coast
of
timor
laut
which
is
formed
by
a
range
of
hills
wooded
to
the
very
summit
and
indented
by
deep
bays
which
would
afford
anchorage
during
the
monsoon
were
it
not
for
a
coral
reef
that
appears
to
extend
along
the
coast
at
a
distance
of
two
to
three
miles
from
the
shore
during
the
day
we
passed
six
villages
all
built
like
oliliet
on
cliffs
overhanging
the
sea
and
protected
on
the
land
side
by
dense
jungle
through
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
penetrate
arru
islands
at
sunset
we
passed
a
small
detached
coral
reef
and
then
steered
for
the
arru
islands
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
gain
some
information
from
the
traders
who
frequent
them
for
the
purpose
of
procuring
the
birds
of
paradise
trepang
pearls
etc
which
are
found
in
their
vicinity
during
our
passage
across
we
had
very
irregular
soundings
and
at
daylight
on
the
of
march
saw
the
arru
islands
all
the
islands
of
this
group
which
extends
from
north
to
south
about
miles
and
the
eastern
limits
of
which
are
but
imperfectly
known
are
very
low
and
swampy
but
from
being
have
the
appearance
of
being
much
higher
than
they
really
are
many
of
the
trees
that
we
saw
attained
a
height
of
ninety
feet
before
they
began
to
branch
out
dobbo
harbour
we
stood
along
the
islands
to
the
northward
all
day
with
very
light
winds
and
on
the
were
off
the
entrance
of
dobbo
harbour
situated
between
the
two
islands
wamma
and
wokan
as
there
were
several
vessels
in
the
harbour
we
tacked
and
made
signal
for
a
pilot
and
were
soon
afterwards
boarded
by
the
master
of
one
of
the
vessels
who
to
our
great
delight
hailed
us
in
very
good
english
under
his
pilotage
we
ran
in
and
anchored
off
a
low
sandy
point
on
which
the
traders
establish
themselves
during
their
stay
by
building
very
neat
bamboo
houses
thatched
with
the
palm
leaf
several
hundred
people
including
some
dutchmen
from
macassar
and
chinamen
remain
throughout
the
year
the
house
of
klaper
and
nitzk
cost
above
pounds
and
contained
goods
to
the
amount
of
ten
times
that
sum
and
upwards
the
trade
with
these
islands
appears
to
be
carried
on
in
the
following
manner
towards
the
end
of
the
monsoon
the
trading
vessels
from
java
and
macassar
having
laid
in
their
stock
for
barter
come
over
to
dobbo
generally
touching
at
the
ki
islands
to
procure
boats
which
are
there
built
in
great
numbers
on
arriving
they
make
the
chief
of
the
island
who
carries
a
stick
with
the
dutch
arms
engraved
upon
it
as
an
emblem
of
his
authority
a
present
which
he
considers
to
be
his
due
consisting
generally
of
arrack
and
tobacco
the
large
boats
they
have
brought
from
the
ki
islands
having
been
thatched
over
and
fitted
with
mat
sails
are
then
despatched
through
the
various
channels
leading
to
the
eastward
under
the
charge
of
a
chinaman
to
trade
for
trepang
pearls
pearl
edible
and
birds
of
paradise
in
return
for
which
they
give
chiefly
knives
arrack
tobacco
coloured
cottons
brass
wire
ornaments
for
the
arms
etc
these
boats
return
to
their
vessels
as
soon
as
they
have
procured
a
cargo
of
which
the
pearls
form
the
most
valuable
portion
the
trepang
obtained
here
is
only
considered
as
that

are
brought
from
the
east
side
of
the
island

to
be
plentiful
they
are
shot
by
the
natives
from
whom
the
traders
purchase
them
for
one
rupee
each
with
blunt
arrows
which
stun
them
without
injuring
the
plumage
and
are
then
skinned
and
dried
the

describe
them
as
keeping
together
in
flocks
headed
by
one
they
call
the
rajah
bird
whose
motions
they
follow
this
is
also
mentioned
by

his
work
on
the
malayan
archipelago
published
in
during
the
absence
of
the

rest
of
the
crews

hauled
up
on
the
western
side

had
not
on

an

the

on
the
whole
gave
them
a
good
character
for
honesty
and
described
them
as
a
harmless
race
very
much
scattered
they
used
formerly
to

could
which

with
them
enough
for

did
not
amount
to
much
we
sailed
for
the
ki

a
group
sixty
miles
to
the
eastward
of
arru
consisting
of
two
large
islands
called
the
greater

and
a
number
of
small
islands
lying
to
the
westward
of
the
latter
the
great
ki

about
sixty
miles
long
high
and
mountainous
the
lesser
ki
and
the
small
islands
are
low
few
parts
of
the
group
attaining
an
elevation
of
more
than
fifty
feet
owing
to
the
light
airs
and
unsettled
weather
attendant
on
the
change
of
the
monsoon
it
was
not
till
the
that
we
arrived
off
the
village
of
ki
illi
situated
on
the
end
of
the
great
ki
and
finding
no
anchorage
the
brig
stood
on
and
off
while
we
landed
in
the
boats
at
the
village
which
is
built
close
down
on
the
beach
and
surrounded
by
a
wall
but
not
so
strongly
protected
by
its
position
as
the
villages
in
timor
laut
the
houses
like
those
at
oliliet
were
raised
on
piles
above
the
ground
but
were
not
surmounted
by
the
carved
gables
which
seem
to
be
peculiar
to
the
tenimber
group
in
the
centre
of
the
village
we
noticed
a
large
building
evidently
a
place
of
worship
surrounded
by
a
grass
plot
on
which
a
number
of
stones
were
ranged
in
a
circle
with
some
taller
ones
in
the
middle
ki
illi
is
celebrated
for
its
manufacture
of
pottery
of
which
we
saw
many
specimens
formed
with
great
taste
of
a
coarse
porous
material
which
being
unglazed
is
well
adapted
for
cooling
by
evaporation
in
the
manner
so
much
used
in
the
east
at
ki
illi
we
had
also
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
boats
which
are
built
in
great
numbers
from
the
excellent
timber
with
which
all
the
islands
of
this
group
abound
they
are
much
used
by
the
traders
frequenting
the
arru
islands
and
were
highly
spoken
of
for
their
durability
and
speed
the
boats
we
saw
though
they
varied
considerably
in
size
were
all
built
on
the
same
plan
having
a
considerable
beam
a
clean
entrance
and
run
a
flat
floor
and
the
stem
and
stern
post
projecting
considerably
above
the
gunwales
they
were
all
built
of
planks
cut
out
of
solid
timber
to
the
form
required
dowelled
together
by
wooden
pegs
as
a
cooper
fastens
the
head
of
a
cask
and
the
whole
afterwards
strengthened
by
timbers
lashed
with
split
rattan
to
solid
cleats
left
for
the
purpose
in
each
plank
during
the
process
of
hewing
it
into
shape
four
of
the
smallest
of
these
boats
were
purchased
for
the
use
of
the
colony
for
about
dollars
each
and
were
found
to
answer
very
well
after
leaving
ki
illi
we
sailed
to
the
southward
along
the
eastern
side
of
the
great
ki
which
is
well
wooded
to
the
summit
of
the
hills
and
cleared
away
for
cultivation
in
many
places
there
is
no
anchorage
off
this
side
of
the
island
which
is
so
steep
to
that
on
one
occasion
we
could
get
no
bottom
with
ninety
fathoms
two
ships
lengths
from
the

at
daylight
on
the
we
entered
the

greater
and
lesser
ki
the
shores
on
both
sides
of
which
are
lined
with
small
patches
of
cultivation
during
the
day
we
observed
several
small
detached
reefs
and
at
sunset
anchored
on
a
reef
extending
from
the
north
end
of
the
lesser
ki

thirteen
fathoms

after
breakfast
i
started
with
some
of
the
officers
to
visit
ki
doulan
the
principal
village
in
the
lesser
ki
and
sent
another
boat
to
sound
towards
a
small
island
to
the
westward
after
leaving
the
brig
we
passed
a
luxuriant
grove
of
coconut
trees
extending
along
the
beach
under
the
shade
of
which
we
saw
several
villages
where
the
natives
were
busily
employed
building
boats
a
pull
of
three
miles
brought
us
to
the
town
of
ki
doulan
situated
near
the
beach
and
surrounded
by
a
stone
wall
which
had
every
appearance
of
antiquity
on
the
sea
side
where
the
wall
was
in
its
best
state
of
preservation
there
were
three
gates
leading
towards
the
beach
but
accessible
only
by
means
of
ladders
four
or
five
feet
high
which
could
easily
be
removed
in
case
of
attack
the
stones
forming
the
sides
of
the
central
gateway
were
ornamented
by
rude
representing
figures
on
horseback
and
the
gate
itself
formed
of
hard
wood
and
strong
enough
to
keep
out
any
party
not
provided
with
artillery
was
richly
carved
natives
of
ki
doulan
within
the
walls
there
was
a
considerable
space
in
which
the
houses
were
built
without
any
regularity
resembling
those
at
oliliet
with
the
exception
of
the
carved
horns
at
the
gable
we
visited
the
chief
and
found
it
tolerably
clean
it
consisted
of
one
storey
only
the
roof
being
used
as
a
storeroom
to
the
rafters
of
which
all
sorts
of
miscellaneous
articles
were
suspended
the
chief
himself
who
was
an
old
man
dressed
in
the
black
serge
denoting
his
rank
was
very
civil
and
offered
us
arrack
and
cocoa
nuts
the
natives
of
this
group
differ
considerably
from
those
of
arru
and
more
resemble
those
of
timor
laut
but
are
not
so
much
inclined
to
treachery
the
population
is
said
to
amount
to
or
christianity
has
not
made
the
same
progress
here
as
at
arru
and
many
of
the
natives
profess
the
mahometan
faith
to
which
they
have
been
converted
by
the
mahometans
of
ceram
who
have
several
priests
in
the
islands
they
pay
great
attention
to
cultivation
and
produce
considerable
quantities
of
coconut
oil
of
a
superior
quality
is
also
found
but
their
chief
source
of
trade
consists
in
the
number
of
boats
and
proas
of
various
sizes
they
build
of
the
timber
which
abounds
in
both
islands
outside
the
walls
we
noticed
several
burial
places
and
in
a
small
shed
not
very
highly
ornamented
was
a
rude
figure
of
a
man
nearly
the
size
of
life
holding
a
spear
in
his
hand
and
near
this
shed
was
a
building
resembling
the
one
at
ki
illi
but
much
smaller
and
very
much
out
of
repair
on
the
beach
two
macassar
proas
were
hauled
up
to
repair
and
their
crews
had
erected
houses
similar
to
those
at
arru
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
on
their
trade
the
boats
of
which
the
natives
had
great
numbers
in
every
stage
of
construction
were
more
highly
finished
than
those
at
ki
illi
but
of
the
same
form
on
returning
on
board
hill
who
had
been
away
sounding
reported
a
clear
channel
to
the
westward
in
the
evening
we
again
landed
at
a
small
village
near
the
ship
beautifully
situated
in
a
most
luxuriant
grove
of
coconut
trees
and
surrounded
by
a
jungle
too
dense
to
penetrate
except
where
a
path
had
been
cleared
many
of
the
trees
were
very
fine
agility
of
jack
white
we
were
all
much
amused
and
surprised
at
the
extraordinary
activity
our
australian
native
jack
white
displayed
in
ascending
the
coconut
trees
which
he
did
with
as
much
ease
as
any
of
us
could
have
mounted
a
ladder
and
when
near
the
top
of
one
of
the
highest
finding
the
sleeves
of
his
frock
and
the
legs
of
his
trousers
in
the
way
he
held
on
with
one
arm
and
leg
while
he
rolled
his
trousers
up
above
the
knee
and
then
with
both
legs
while
he
rolled
his
sleeves
above
his
elbows
his
delight
at
the
coconuts
which
were
quite
new
to
him
was
very
great
although
we
were
not
very
successful
in
obtaining
supplies
on
this
occasion
we
found
on
a
subsequent
visit
when
our
stay
was
longer
that
they
could
be
obtained
at
a
very
moderate
price
firewood
and
water
may
also
be
obtained
without
difficulty
off
the
town
of
ki
doulan
the
water
is
too
deep
for
a
ship
to
anchor
but
the
shoal
which
projects
from
the
point
of
the
island
three
miles
north
of
the
town
affords
good
anchorage
in
both
monsoons
there
seem
to
be
clear
passages
between
all
the
islands
in
this
group
though
contracted
in
places
by
reefs
which
from
the
clearness
of
the
water
can
be
distinctly
seen
from
the
masthead
island
of
vordate
on
the
morning
of
the
we
got
underweigh
and
passing
to
the
westward
of
the
ki
group
saw
the
nusa
tello
islands
indistinctly
through
the
haze
to
the
westward
of
us
at
dawn
on
the
we
made
the
high
land
of
vordate
but
light
winds
prevented
our
making
much
progress
till
the
evening
when
a
light
air
carried
us
along
the
land
and
soon
after
sunset
we
anchored
in
twenty
fathoms
off
a
small
village
daylight
on
the
did
not
impress
us
with
a
favourable
idea
of
our
anchorage
for
it
appeared
we
had
entered
by
a
narrow
and
deep
channel
between
two
reefs
upon
which
there
was
not
more
than
fathoms
at
a
chief
came
off
from
the
village
in
a
large
canoe
pulled
by
about
a
dozen
men
with
a
beating
in
the
bow
he
was
very
anxious
to
get
some
arrack
and
promised
plenty
of
supplies
after
breakfast
we
landed
and
were
saluted
by
one
gun
from
a
proa
hauled
up
on
the
beach
our
arrival
had
evidently
caused
much
excitement
among
the
natives
who
came
down
in
great
numbers
and
formed
a
semicircle
round
the
boat
they
were
nearly
all
armed
with
cresses
and
spears
several
of
them
wore
a
sort
of
breastplate
made
of
hide
and
their
heads
were
ornamented
with
a
profusion
of
richly
coloured
feathers
and
long
projections
formed
of
white
calico
long
necklaces
of
shells
hung
down
to
their
waists
and
all
had
their
hair
dyed
in
the
same
way
as
at
oliliet
here
we
again
noticed
the
carved
horns
surmounting
the
gables
of
the
houses
the
oran
kaya
soon
after
we
landed
the
oran
kaya
made
his
appearance
and
seemed
to
be
in
a
great
state
of
alarm
as
soon
as
he
got
within
the
circle
of
his
countrymen
he
commenced
a
series
of
most
profound
salaams
bending
his
head
down
till
he
touched
my
feet
by
way
of
reassuring
him
i
presented
him
with
a
fine
gaudy
red
shawl
which
for
a
time
had
the
desired
effect
and
he
then
produced
a
document
in
dutch
signed
by
lieutenant
kolff
which
appeared
to
be
a
certificate
of
good
conduct
by
means
of
the
vocabulary
and
dictionary
i
tried
to
make
them
understand
that
we
only
wanted
some
pigs
vegetables
and
poultry
for
which
we
had
brought
money
to
pay
or
goods
to
exchange
these
he
promised
to
procure
for
us
and
to
send
them
on
board
earnestly
making
signs
all
the
time
that
we
should
go
away
as
soon
as
possible
alarm
of
the
natives
finding
the
natives
still
coming
down
to
the
beach
in
great
numbers
and
that
all
were
in
a
highly
excited
state
we
merely
gratified
our
curiosity
on
the
beach
without
attempting
to
go
into
their
village
and
returned
on
board
we
subsequently
found
out
that
the
natives
had
some
reason
to
be
alarmed
at
our
appearance
as
they
had
been
recently
visited
by
a
frigate
sent
by
the
dutch
government
to
punish
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighbouring
island
laarat
for
the
murder
of
captain
harris
and
part
of
the
crew
of
the
english
bark
alexander
on
which
occasion
she
destroyed
the
village
and
took
away
several
of
the
natives
who
were
supposed
to
have
been
implicated
in
the
business
prisoners
to
amboyna
after
about
an
hour
during
which
the
natives
remained
in
a
compact
group
on
the
beach
evidently
in
deep
consultation
the
same
chief
who
visited
us
in
the
morning
came
off
again
bringing
with
him
the
promised
supplies
consisting
only
of
a
and
a
small
pig
we
tried
some
time
in
vain
to
convince
him
we
had
no
hostile
intentions
and
as
the
weather
was
too
unsettled
to
remain
in
so
insecure
an
anchorage
we
weighed
and
made
sail
for
oliliet
passing
close
along
the
island
of
vordate
which
is
moderately
high
luxuriantly
wooded
very
well
cultivated
and
apparently
densely
inhabited
it
is
separated
from
laarat
by
a
narrow
strait
which
from
the
way
the
sea
broke
across
it
appeared
to
be
quite
shoal
return
to
oliliet
april
at
we
were
off
laouran
but
finding
the
swell
occasioned
by
the
strong
breezes
experienced
yesterday
was
breaking
too
heavily
on
the
reef
skirting
the
bay
for
a
boat
to
land
we
stood
on
for
oliliet
and
on
rounding
the
point
fired
a
gun
and
hove
to
two
canoes
soon
after
left
the
beach
and
from
the
number
of
articles
of
european
manufacture
with
which
they
were
decorated
we
soon
saw
that
some
vessel
must
have
visited
the
place
since
our
departure
and
on
the
chief
coming
on
board
he
handed
me
some
papers
from
which
i
ascertained
that
watson
commanding
the
essington
schooner
had
visited
the
place
during
our
absence
and
by
having
a
person
on
board
who
could
communicate
with
the
natives
he
had
succeeded
by
threats
and
promises
held
out
to
the
chiefs
in
getting
the
european
boy
given
up
to
him
the
boy
had
nearly
forgotten
his
english
at
first
but
watson
afterwards
made
out
that
he
belonged
to
the
stedcombe
schooner
the
crew
of
which
were
all
murdered
by
the
natives
while
engaged
in
watering
their
vessel
he
had
been
ten
years
on
the
island
during
which
time
he
had
been
well
treated
by
his
captors
the
brig
was
obliged
to
stand
off
and
on
as
there
is
no
anchorage
off
oliliet
during
the
monsoon
which
had
now
set
in
but
two
boats
were
sent
on
shore
to
obtain
supplies
conduct
of
the
natives
they
were
well
received
by
the
natives
and
again
visited
the
village
where
they
were
surprised
to
find
that
all
the
women
came
out
to
see
them
all
both
young
and
old
were
dressed
in
a
dark
coloured
wrapper
which
reached
from
the
waist
to
the
knees
and
on
their
ankles
they
wore
a
profusion
of
bright
brass
ornaments
the
boats
were
not
very
successful
in
procuring
stock
but
the
chiefs
promised
an
abundant
supply
in
the
morning
which
i
determined
to
wait
for
and
accordingly
worked
to
windward
under
easy
sail
during
the
night
but
found
at
daylight
that
we
had
been
sent
so
far
to
the
southward
by
a
current
that
it
was
before
we
were
again
near
enough
to
send
the
boats
in
on
landing
they
found
all
their
chiefs
and
a
considerable
number
of
the
natives
waiting
on
the
beach
with
vegetables
etc
for
sale
but
they
had
hardly
commenced
their
barter
when
a
powerful
looking
man
armed
with
a
large
spear
in
a
state
of
intoxication
came
rushing
down
from
the
village
he
made
directly
for
the
crowd
upon
the
beach
apparently
with
the
intention
of
attacking
our
party
but
the
natives
immediately
closed
upon
him
and
after
some
trouble
disarmed
him
after
which
he
continued
to
rush
about
the
crowd
in
a
violent
state
of
excitement
running
against
any
of
our
party
he
could
see
and
making
urgent
signs
to
them
to
leave
the
shore
at
the
same
time
the
noise
and
confusion
on
the
beach
was
so
great
that
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
party
prepared
to
return
on
board
at
once
in
order
to
avoid
any
collision
with
the
natives
as
soon
as
the
chiefs
became
aware
of
his
intention
they
were
most
anxious
he
should
remain
and
made
every
profession
of
friendship
to
induce
him
to
do
so
but
he
had
heard
so
much
of
their
treachery
from
the
traders
at
arru
that
he
resisted
their
entreaties
and
returned
on
board
at
eleven
arrive
at
port
essington
as
soon
as
the
boats
were
hoisted
up
we
made
sail
for
port
essington
and
anchored
there
on
the
of
april
it
was
our
intention
to
have
concluded
this
volume
with
captain
narrative
but
as
the
following
account
of
the
daring
manner
in
which
watson
rescued
the
english
boy
from
the
savages
of
timor
laut
has
fallen
into
our
hands
and
as
doubtless
it
was
the
cause
of
the
strange
and
suspicious
reception
the
britomart
boats
met
with
on
their
second
visit
to
oliliet
we
here
lay
it
before
our
readers
watson
proceedings
at
timor
laut
watson
had
not
been
off
the
island
long
before
his
vessel
the
schooner
essington
was
surrounded
by
eleven
armed
canoes
for
the
purpose
of
attack
the
chief
wished
watson
to
go
in
and
anchor
which
he
refused
but
showed
him
that
he
was
ready
for
defence
in
case
of
any
outrage
on
their
part
the
chief
thinking
he
could
entrap
him
made
signs
of
friendship
and
watson
allowed
him
and
his
crew
to
come
on
board
the
chief
then
said
that
a
white
man
was
on
shore
and
wished
the
master
to
go
and
fetch
him
off
which
was
refused
watson
then
laid
out
an
immense
quantity
of
merchandise
which
he
said
he
would
give
for
the
white
man
and
desired
the
chief
to
send
his
canoe
ashore
to
fetch
him
stating
however
that
he
would
retain
him
on
board
till
the
white
man
came
and
also
that
if
he
was
not
immediately
brought
he
would
either
hang
or
shoot
the
chief
and
he
had
rope
prepared
for
the
purpose
as
also
a
gun
this
manoeuvre
had
the
desired
effect
on
the
chief
who
immediately
despatched
his
canoe
to
the
shore
for
three
days
and
nights
watson
was
compelled
to
cruise
off
the
island
the
natives
still
refusing
to
bring
off
forbes
towards
the
close
of
the
third
day
they
brought
off
the
boy
but
would
not
put
him
on
board
until
watson
placed
the
rope
round
the
chief
neck
when
they
came
alongside
and
as
the
crew
of
the
essington
were
hoisting
forbes
up
the
side
of
the
vessel
the
chief
jumped
overboard
into
his
canoe
watson
made
the
chief
come
on
board
again
and
told
him
that
although
he
had
deceived
and
wished
to
entrap
him
yet
he
would
show
that
the
white
men
were
as
good
as
their
word
and
not
only
gave
the
chief
the
promised
wares
but
also
distributed
some
to
each
of
the
other
ten
canoes
this
line
of
conduct
had
a
very
good
effect
on
the
natives
who
after
receiving
the
goods
expressed
great
joy
and
as
they
were
leaving
kept
up
a
constant
cheer
forbes
at
first
appeared
in
a
savage
state
but
after
a
short
time
stated
the
following
particulars
relative
to
the
loss
of
the
stedcombe
and
the
massacre
of
the
crew
the
stedcombe
barns
master
arrived
off
the
coast
in
the
year
having
left
her
in
charge
of
the
mate
he
and
two
or
three
others
went
ashore
at
melville
island
when
at
sydney
in
i
met
barns
who
corroborated
forbes
account
the
mate
ran
her
into
timor
laut
and
anchored
he
then
went
ashore
with
the
crew
leaving
the
steward
forbes
and
another
boy
on
board
after
they
had
been
ashore
a
short
time
forbes
looked
through
a
telescope
to
see
what
they
were
about
when
he
saw
that
the
whole
of
the
crew
were
being
massacred
by
the
natives
he
immediately
communicated
that
fact
to
the
steward
and
advised
him
to
unshackle
the
anchor
and
run
out
to
sea
as
the
wind
was
from
the
land
the
steward
told
him
to
go
about
his
business
and
when
he
got
on
deck
he
found
the
vessel
surrounded
with
canoes
the
natives
came
on
board
and
murdered
the
steward
forbes
and
the
other
boy
got
up
the
rigging
and
in
consequence
of
their
expertness
the
natives
were
unable
to
catch
them
but
at
last
made
signs
for
them
to
come
down
and
they
would
not
hurt
them
they
availed
themselves
of
the
only
chance
left
them
of
saving
their
lives
and
surrendered
they
were
immediately
bound
and
taken
on
shore
a
rope
was
fastened
to
the
ship
her
cable
slipped
and
the
natives
hauled
her
ashore
where
she
soon
became
a
wreck
forbes
states
that
several
dutchmen
had
called
at
the
island
to
whom
he
appealed
for
rescue
but
they
all
refused
to
interfere
and
latterly
whenever

completely
lost

a
single
example
of
the

of
this

named
in
honour
of
the
able
commander
of

the
species
bears
a
near
resemblance
to
the
scorpaena
militaris
but
differs
from
it
in
having
no
spinous
point
terminating
the
intra

ridges
and
in
the
distribution
of
the
scales
on

spinous
points
on
the
head

very
near
to
those

inferior
preorbitar
tooth
is
acutely
spinous

the
two
anterior
ones
are
inconspicuous

not
very
acute
and
the
smaller
upper
posterior
one
observed
in
most
scorpaenae
is
obsolete
or
at
least
completely
hidden
by
the
integuments
the
nasal
spines
are
as
usual
small
simple
and
acute
the
three
supra
orbitar
teeth
are
smaller
than
in
militaris
and
the
middle
one
reclines
so
as
to
be
concealed
by
the
integument
instead
of
standing
boldly
up
the
two
low
ridges
between
the
orbits

not
end
in

points
the
lateral
ridges

over
the
supra
scapulars
and
the
temporal
ridges
which
are
parallel
to
them
but
run
farther
back
contain
each
four
teeth
the
ridge
is
slightly
uneven
anteriorly
and
two
reclining
teeth
may
be
made
out
at
its
posterior
end
the
preoperculum
is
curved
in
the

and
has
a
short
spine
with
a
smaller
one
on
its
base
opposite
to
the
abutment
of
the
ridge
beneath
this
spine
there
are
four
angular
points
on

about
the
origin
of
the

but
the

is
a

also
lax

on
the
inferior

the

not
admit
of

this

in

from
a

from

it
has
very

the
form
of

several
examples
in

were
brought
by
the
officers
of
the
beagle
from
the
coast
of
australia
all
of
which
show
a
broad
band
passing
between
the
dorsal
and
anal
fins
which
was
not
visible
in
the
dried
specimen
this
band
is
bounded
anteriorly
by
one
and
posteriorly
by
two
whitish
lines
in
the
annals
the
anal
fin
is
described
as
being
more
angular
than
the
dorsal
but
in
the
specimens
in
spirits
the
reverse
appears
to
be
the
case
this
variation
depends
on
the
degree
or
expansion
of
the
fins
and
both
may
be
much
rounded
by
pulling
the
rays

the

distribution
of

may
be
clearly
made

probably
vary
in
number
in
different
individuals

our
careful
enumeration
of

gives
two

induced
me
at
first
sight
to
refer
it
to
the

but
on
examination
i
found
that
very
material
alterations
would
require
to
be
made
in
the
generic
characters
assigned
to
pseudochromis
to
enable
them
to
apply
to
our
fish
swainson
considering
this
name
as
very
objectionable
has
proposed
labristoma
instead
both
names
are
founded
on
the
resemblance
which
the
fish
bears
to
another
genus
in
whole
or
in
part
and
the
objection
which
has
been
made
to
the
one
is
equally
valid
against
the
other
the
above
character
has
therefore
been
drawn
up
and
ichthyologists
may
consider
assiculus
either
as
a
proper
generic
form
or
as
merely
a
subgenus
or
subdivision
of
pseudochromis
with
an
extended
character
according
to
their
different
views
of
arrangement
the
last
named
genus
as
described
and
restricted
by
ruppell
from
whom
all
our
knowledge
of
it
is
derived
has
the
jaw
teeth
disposed
in
a
single
row
and
the
minute
palatine
teeth
of
a

the
operculum
has
its

of

and
which
are
to
be
placed
valenciennes
thinks
near
malacanthus
among
the
labridae
now
this
family
according
to
agassiz
is
essentially
cycloid
in
the
structure
of
its
scales
although
there
is
a
slight
departure
from
the
rigid
characters
of
the
order
in
the
serrated
preopercular
of
crenilabrus
ctenolabrus
and
some
others
and
in
the
spine
bearing
operculum
of
malacanthus
the
latter
genus
is
moreover
described
by
agassiz
as
possessing
scales
with
toothed
edges
and
rough
to
the
touch
when
the
finger
is
drawn
forwards
it
has
the
simple
intestinal
canal
without
caeca
which
is
proper
to
the
labridae
the
intestine
of
pseudochromis
is
similarly
formed
the
stomach
being
continuous
with
the
rest
of
the
alimentary
canal
and
not
distinguished
by
any
cul
de
sac
having
but
one
specimen
of
assiculus
for
examination
i
have
not
been
able
to
submit
it
to
dissection
to
see
whether
the
structure
of
its
intestines
be
the
same
or
not
but
both
it
and
pseudochromis
differ
very
widely
from
the
labroid
type
in
their
scales
possessing
the
peculiar
firm
shining
strongly
ciliated
structure
which
we
observe
in
glyphisodon
and
its
allies
and
in
the
lateral
line
being
interrupted
in
a
precisely
similar
manner
chromis
and
plesiops
have
already
been
removed
by
valenciennes
from
the
labridae
to
the
glyphisodontidae
and
it
is
with
them
that
we
feel
inclined
to
range
assiculus
and
pseudochromis
notwithstanding
the
discrepancies
in
the
form
of
the
intestinal
canal
we
can
however
trace
a
gradation
in
the
variation
of
form
the
normal
number
of
caeca
in
the
glyphysodontidae
is
three
in
chromis
there
are
generally
two
small
ones
while
the
bolti
of
the
nile
or
the
chromis
niloticus
of
cuvier
has
no
pyloric
caecum
but
a
large
cul
de
sac
to
the
stomach
malacanthus
is
widely
separated
from
the
glyphisodontidae
by
its
continuous
lateral
line

these
remarks
were

i
have

the
chromidae
are

as
a

which
latter
he
names
labroidei
stenoidei
