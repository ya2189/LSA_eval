preface
in
the
latter
half
of
a
few
of
us
were
writing
that
this
war
was
a
war
of
ideas
a
phrase
the
war
to
end
war
got
into
circulation
amidst
much
sceptical
comment
it
was
a
phrase
powerful
enough
to
sway
many
men
essentially
pacifists
towards
taking
an
active
part
in
the
war
against
german
imperialism
but
it
was
a
phrase
whose
chief
content
was
its
aspiration
people
were
already
writing
in
those
early
days
of
disarmament
and
of
the
abolition
of
the
armament
industry
throughout
the
world
they
realized
fully
the
element
of
industrial
belligerency
behind
the
shining
armour
of
imperialism
and
they
denounced
the
alliance
but
against
such
writing
and
such
thought
we
had
to
count
in
those
days
great
and
powerful
realities
even
to
those
who
expressed
these
ideas
there
lay
visibly
upon
them
the
shadow
of
impracticability
they
were
very
advanced
ideas
in
very
utopian
against
them
was
an
unbroken
mass
of
mental
habit
and
public
tradition
while
we
talked
of
this
war
to
end
war
the
diplomatists
of
the
powers
allied
against
germany
were
busily
spinning
a
disastrous
web
of
greedy
secret
treaties
were
answering
aggression
by
schemes
of
aggression
were
seeing
in
the
treacherous
violence
of
germany
only
the
justification
for
countervailing
evil
acts
to
them
it
was
only
another
war
for
ascendancy
that
was
three
years
and
a
half
ago
and
since
then
this
war
of
ideas
has
gone
on
to
a
phase
few
of
us
had
dared
hope
for
in
those
opening
days
the
russian
revolution
put
a
match
to
that
pile
of
secret
treaties
and
indeed
to
all
the
imperialist
plans
of
the
allies
in
the
end
it
will
burn
them
all
the
greatest
of
the
western
allies
is
now
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
americans
have
come
into
this
war
simply
for
an
idea
three
years
and
a
half
ago
a
few
of
us
were
saying
this
was
a
war
against
the
idea
of
imperialism
not
german
imperialism
merely
but
british
and
french
and
russian
imperialism
and
we
were
saying
this
not
because
it
was
so
but
because
we
hoped
to
see
it
become
so
we
can
say
so
because
now
it
is
so
in
those
days
moreover
we
said
this
is
the
war
to
end
war
and
we
still
did
not
know
clearly
how
we
thought
in
terms
of
treaties
and
alliances
it
is
largely
the
detachment
and
practical
genius
of
the
great
nation
across
the
atlantic
that
has
carried
the
world
on
beyond
and
replaced
that
phrase
by
the
phrase
the
league
of
nations
a
phrase
suggesting
plainly
the
organization
of
a
sufficient
instrument
by
which
war
may
be
ended
for
ever
in
talk
of
a
world
league
of
nations
would
have
seemed
to
the
extremest
pitch
utopian
the
project
has
an
air
not
only
of
being
so
practicable
but
of
being
so
urgent
and
necessary
and
so
manifestly
the
sane
thing
before
mankind
that
not
to
be
busied
upon
it
not
to
be
making
it
more
widely
known
and
better
understood
not
to
be
working
out
its
problems
and
bringing
it
about
is
to
be
living
outside
of
the
contemporary
life
of
the
world
for
a
book
upon
any
other
subject
at
the
present
time
some
apology
may
be
necessary
but
a
book
upon
this
subject
is
as
natural
a
thing
to
produce
now
as
a
pair
of
skates
in
winter
when
the
ice
begins
to
bear
all
we
writers
find
ourselves
engaged
perforce
in
some
part
or
other
of
a
propaganda
of
this
the
most
creative
and
hopeful
of
political
ideas
that
has
ever
dawned
upon
the
consciousness
of
mankind
with
no
concerted
plan
we
feel
called
upon
to
serve
it
and
in
no
connection
would
one
so
like
to
think
oneself
as
in
this
connection
it
would
be
a
dismaying
thing
to
realize
that
one
were
writing
anything
here
which
was
not
the
possible
thought
of
great
multitudes
of
other
people
and
capable
of
becoming
the
common
thought
of
mankind
one
writes
in
such
a
book
as
this
not
to
express
oneself
but
to
swell
a
chorus
the
idea
of
the
league
of
nations
is
so
great
a
one
that
it
may
well
override
the
pretensions
and
command
the
allegiance
of
kings
much
more
does
it
claim
the
of
the
journalistic
writer
our
innumerable
books
upon
this
great
edifice
of
a
world
peace
do
not
constitute
a
scramble
for
attention
but
an
attempt
to
express
in
every
variety
of
phrase
and
aspect
this
one
system
of
ideas
which
now
possesses
us
all
in
the
same
way
the
elementary
facts
and
ideas
of
the
science
of
chemistry
might
conceivably
be
put
completely
and
fully
into
one
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
far
more
convenient
to
tell
that
same
story
over
in
a
thousand
different
forms
in
a
for
boys
here
for
a
different
sort
or
class
of
boy
there
for
adult
students
for
reference
for
people
expert
in
mathematics
for
people
unused
to
the
scientific
method
and
so
on
for
the
last
year
the
writer
has
been
doing
what
he
can
and
a
number
of
other
writers
have
been
doing
what
they
can
to
bring
about
a
united
declaration
of
all
the
atlantic
allies
in
favour
of
a
league
of
nations
and
to
define
the
necessary
nature
of
that
league
he
has
in
the
course
of
this
work
written
a
series
of
articles
upon
the
league
and
upon
necessary
sacrifices
of
that
the
idea
involves
in
the
london
press
he
has
also
been
trying
to
clear
his
own
mind
upon
the
real
meaning
of
that
ambiguous
word
democracy
for
which
the
league
is
to
make
the
world
safe
the
bulk
of
this
book
is
made
up
of
these
discussions
for
a
very
considerable
number
of
readers
it
may
be
well
to
admit
here
it
can
have
no
possible
interest
they
will
have
come
at
these
questions
themselves
from
different
angles
and
they
will
have
long
since
got
to
their
own
conclusions
but
there
may
be
others
whose
angle
of
approach
may
be
similar
to
the
writer
who
may
have
asked
some
or
most
of
the
questions
he
has
had
to
ask
and
who
may
be
actively
interested
in
the
answers
and
the
working
out
of
the
answers
he
has
made
to
these
questions
for
them
this
book
is
printed
wells
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
recommend
specific
books
out
of
so
large
and
various
a
literature
as
the
league
of
nations
idea
has
already
produced
but
the
reader
who
wishes
to
reach
beyond
the
range
of
this
book
or
who
does
not
like
its
tone
and
method
will
probably
find
something
to
meet
his
needs
and
tastes

a
very
sympathetic
contribution
from

but
the
reader
must
understand
that
these
two
writers
seem
disposed
to
welcome
a
peace
with
an
unrevolutionized

idea
to

in

with

i

but
i
have
made
no

get

upon
the
subject
and
probably
there
are
just
as
many
books
as
good
of
which
i
have
never
even
heard
there
must
i
am
sure
be
statements
of
the
league

idea
forthcoming
from
various
religious
standpoints
but
i
do
not
know
any
sufficiently
well
to
recommend
them
it
is
incredible
that
neither
the
roman
catholic
church
the
english
episcopal
church
nor
any
nonconformist
body
has
made
any
effort
as
an
organization
to
forward

essentially
religious
end
of

on

also
there
must
be
german
writings
upon

topic
i
mention

diverse
sources
not
in
order
to
present
a
bibliography
but
because
i
should
be
sorry
to
have

i
the
way
to
concrete
realization
more
and
more
frequently
does
one
hear
this
phrase
the
league
of
nations
used
to
express
the
outline
idea
of
the
new
world
that
will
come
out
of
the
war
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
phrase
has
taken
hold
of
the
imaginations
of
great
multitudes
of
people
it
is
one
of
those
creative
phrases
that
may
alter
the
whole
destiny
of
mankind
but
as
yet
it
is
still
a
very
vague
phrase
a
cloudy
promise
of
peace
i
make
no
apology
therefore
for
casting
my
discussion
of
it
in
the
most
general
terms
the
idea
is
the
idea
of
united
human
effort
to
put
an
end
to
wars
the
first
practical
question
that
must
precede
all
others
is
how
far
can
we
hope
to
get
to
a
concrete
realization
of
that
but
first
let
me
note
the
fourth
word
in
the
second
title
of
this
book
the
common
talk
is
of
a
league
of
nations
merely
i
follow
the
man
who
is
more
than
any
other
man
the
leader
of
english
political
thought
throughout
the
world
president
wilson
in
inserting
that
significant
adjective
free
we
western
allies
know
what
is
involved
in
making
bargains
with
governments
that
do
not
stand
for
their
peoples
we
have
had
all
our
russian
deal
for
example
repudiated
and
thrust
back
upon
our
hands
and
it
is
clearly
in
his
mind
as
it
must
be
in
the
minds
of
all
reasonable
men
that
no
mere
scrap
of
paper
with
just
a
monarch
or
a
chancellor
endorsement
is
a
good
enough
earnest
of
fellowship
in
the
league
it
can
not
be
a
diplomatist
league
the
league
of
nations
if
it
is
to
have
any
such
effect
as
people
seem
to
hope
from
it
must
be
in
the
first
place
understanded
of
the
people
it
must
be
supported
by
sustained
deliberate
explanation
and
by
teaching
in
school
and
church
and
press
of
the
whole
mass
of
all
the
peoples
concerned
i
underline
the
adjective
free
here
to
set
aside
once
for
all
any
possible
misconception
that
this
modern
idea
of
a
league
of
nations
has
any
affinity
to
that
holy
alliance
of
the
diplomatists
which
set
out
to
keep
the
peace
of
europe
so
disastrously
a
century
ago
later
i
will
discuss
the
powers
of
the
league
but
before
i
come
to
that
i
would
like
to
say
a
little
about
the
more
general
question
of
its
nature
and
authority
what
sort
of
gathering
will
embody
it
the
suggestions
made
range
from
a
mere
advisory
body
rather
like
the
hague
convention
which
will
merely
pronounce
on
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
any
international
conflict
to
the
idea
of
a
sort
of
a
parliament
of
mankind
a
super
national
authority
practically
taking
over
the
sovereignty
of
the
existing
states
and
empires
of
the
world
most
people
ideas
of
the
league
fall
between
these
extremes
they
want
the
league
to
be
something
more
than
an
ethical
court
they
want
a
league
that
will
act
but
on
the
other
hand
they
shrink
from
any
loss
of
our
independence
there
seems
to
be
a
conflict
here
there
is
a
real
need
for
many
people
to
tidy
up
their
ideas
at
this
point
we
can
not
have
our
cake
and
eat
it
if
association
is
worth
while
there
must
be
some
sacrifice
of
freedom
to
association
as
a
very
distinguished
colonial
representative
said
to
me
the
other
day
here
we
are
talking
of
the
freedom
of
small
nations
and
the
of
peoples
and
at
the
same
time
of
the
council
of
the
league
of
nations
and
all
sorts
of
international
controls
which
do
we
want
the
answer
i
think
is
both
it
is
a
matter
of
more
or
less
of
getting
the
best
thing
at
the
cost
of
the
we
may
want
to
relax
an
old
association
in
order
to
make
a
newer
and
wider
one
it
is
quite
understandable
that
peoples
aware
of
a
distinctive
national
character
and
involved
in
some
big
existing
political
complex
should
wish
to
disentangle
themselves
from
one
group
of
associations
in
order
to
enter
more
effectively
into
another
a
greater
and
more
satisfactory
one
the
finn
or
the
pole
who
has
hitherto
been
a
rather
reluctant
member
of
the
synthesis
of
the
russian
empire
may
well
wish
to
end
that
attachment
in
order
to
become
a
free
member
of
a
worldwide
brotherhood
the
desire
for
free
arrangement
is
not
a
desire
for
chaos
there
is
such
a
thing
as
untying
your
parcels
in
order
to
pack
them
better
and
i
do
not
see
myself
how
we
can
possibly
contemplate
a
great
league
of
freedom
and
reason
in
the
world
without
a
considerable
amount
of
such
preliminary
dissolution
it
happens
very
fortunately
for
the
world
that
a
century
and
a
quarter
ago
thirteen
various
and
very
jealous
states
worked
out
the
problem
of
a
union
and
became
after
an
enormous
exhausting
wrangle
the
united
states
of
america
now
the
way
they
solved
their
riddle
was
by
delegating
and
giving
over
jealously
specified
sovereign
powers
and
doing
all
that
was
possible
to
retain
the
residuum
they
remained
essentially
sovereign
states
new
york
virginia
massachusetts
for
example
remained
legally
independent
the
practical
fusion
of
these
peoples
into
one
people
outran
the
legal
bargain
it
was
only
after
long
years
of
discussion
that
the
point
was
conceded
it
was
indeed
only
after
the
civil
war
that
the
implications
were
fully
established
that
there
resided
a
sovereignty
in
the
american
people
as
a
whole
as
distinguished
from
the
peoples
of
the
several
states
this
is
a
precedent
that
every
one
who
talks
about
the
league
of
nations
should
bear
in
mind
these
states
set
up
a
congress
and
president
in
washington
with
strictly
delegated
powers
that
congress
and
president
they
delegated
to
look
after
certain
common
interests
to
deal
with
interstate
trade
to
deal
with
foreign
powers
to
maintain
a
supreme
court
of
law
everything
else
education
militia
powers
of
life
and
death
the
states
retained
for
themselves
to
this
day
for
instance
the
federal
courts
and
the
federal
officials
have
no
power
to
interfere
to
protect
the
lives
or
property
of
aliens
in
any
part
of
the
union
outside
the
district
of
columbia
the
state
governments
still
see
to
that
the
federal
government
has
the
legal
right
perhaps
to
intervene
but
it
is
still
chary
of
such
intervention
and
these
states
of
the
american
union
were
at
the
outset
so
that
they
would
not
even
adopt
a
common
name
to
this
day
they
have
no
common
name
we
have
to
call
them
americans
which
is
a
ridiculous
name
when
we
consider
that
canada
mexico
peru
brazil
are
all
of
them
also
in
america
or
else
we
have
to
call
them
virginians
californians
new
englanders
and
so
forth
their
legal
and
nominal
separateness
weighs
nothing
against
the
real
fusion
that
their
great
league
has
now
made
possible
now
that
clearly
is
a
precedent
of
the
utmost
value
in
our
schemes
for
this
council
of
the
league
of
nations
we
must
begin
by
delegating
as
the
states
began
by
delegating
it
is
a
far
cry
to
the
time
when
we
shall
talk
and
think
of
the
sovereign
people
of
the
earth
that
council
of
the
league
of
nations
will
be
a
tie
as
strong
we
hope
but
certainly
not
so
close
and
multiplex
as
the
early
tie
of
the
states
at
washington
it
will
begin
by
having
certain
delegated
powers
and
no
others
it
will
be
an
body
later
its
powers
may
grow
as
mankind
becomes
accustomed
to
it
but
at
first
it
will
have
directly
or
mediately
all
the
powers
that
seem
necessary
to
restrain
the
world
from
war
and
unless
i
know
nothing
of
patriotic
jealousies
it
will
have
not
a
scrap
of
power
more
the
danger
is
much
more
that
its
powers
will
be
insufficient
than
that
they
will
be
excessive
of
that
later
what
i
want
to
discuss
here
now
is
the
constitution
of
this
delegated
body
i
want
to
discuss
that
first
in
order
to
set
aside
out
of
the
discussion
certain
fantastic
notions
that
will
otherwise
get
very
seriously
in
our
way
fantastic
as
they
are
they
have
played
a
large
part
in
reducing
the
hague
tribunal
to
an
ineffective
squeak
amidst
the
thunders
of
this
war
a
number
of
gentlemen
scheming
out
world
unity
in
studies
have
begun
their
proposals
with
the
simple
suggestion
that
each
sovereign
power
should
send
one
member
to
the
projected
parliament
of
mankind
this
has
a
pleasant
democratic
air
one
sovereign
state
one
vote
now
let
us
run
over
a
list
of
sovereign
states
and
see
to
what
this
leads
us
we
find
our
list
includes
the
british
empire
with
a
population
of
four
hundred
millions
of
which
probably
half
can
read
and
write
some
language
or
other
bogota
with
a
population
of
a
million
mostly
poets
hayti
with
a
population
of
a
million
and
a
third
almost
entirely
illiterate
and
liable
at
any
time
to
further
political
disruption
andorra
with
a
population
of
four
or
five
thousand
souls
the
mere
suggestion
of
equal
representation
between
such
powers
is
enough
to
make
the
british
empire
burst
into
a
thousand
voting
fragments
a
certain
concession
to
population
one
must
admit
was
made
by
the
theorists
a
state
of
over
three
millions
got
if
i
remember
rightly
two
delegates
and
if
over
twenty
three
and
some
of
the
small
states
were
given
a
kind
of
intermittent
appearance
they
only
came
every
other
time
or
something
of
that
sort
but
at
the
hague
things
still
remained
in
such
a
posture
that
three
or
four
minute
and
backward
states
could
outvote
the
british
empire
or
the
united
states
therein
lies
the
clue
to
the
insignificance
of
the
hague
such
projects
as
these
are
idle
projects
and
we
must
put
them
out
of
our
heads
they
are
against
nature
the
great
nations
will
not
suffer
them
for
a
moment
but
when
we
dismiss
this
idea
of
representation
by
states
we
are
left
with
the
problem
of
the
proportion
of
representation
and
of
relative
weight
in
the
council
of
the
league
on
our
hands
it
is
the
sort
of
problem
that
appeals
terribly
to
the
ingenious
we
can
not
solve
it
by
making
population
a
basis
because
that
will
give
a
monstrous
importance
to
the
illiterate
millions
of
india
and
china
ingenious
statistical
schemes
have
been
framed
in
which
the
number
of
university
graduates
and
the
steel
output
come
in
as
multipliers
but
for
my
own
part
i
am
not
greatly
impressed
by
statistical
schemes
at
the
risk
of
seeming
something
of
a
prussian
i
would
like
to
insist
upon
certain
brute
facts
the
business
of
the
league
of
nations
is
to
keep
the
peace
of
the
world
and
nothing
else
no
power
will
ever
dare
to
break
the
peace
of
the
world
if
the
powers
that
are
capable
of
making
war
under
modern
conditions
say
and
there
are
only
four
powers
certainly
capable
at
the
present
time
of
producing
the
men
and
materials
needed
for
a
modern
war
in
sufficient
abundance
to
go
on
fighting
britain
france
germany
and
the
united
states
there
are
three
others
which
are
very
doubtfully
capable
italy
japan
and
austria
russia
i
will
mark
it
is
all
that
one
can
do
with
russia
just
now
with
a
note
of
interrogation
some
day
china
may
be
war
capable
i
hope
never
but
it
is
a
possibility
personally
i
do
think
that
any
other
power
on
earth
would
have
a
ghost
of
a
chance
to
resist
the
will
if
it
could
be
an
honestly
united
will
of
the
four
all
the
rest
fight
by
the
sanction
of
and
by
association
with
these
leaders
they
can
only
fight
because
of
the
split
will
of
the
powers
some
are
forced
to
fight
by
that
very
division
no
one
can
vie
with
me
in
my
appreciation
of
the
civilization
of
switzerland
sweden
or
holland
but
the
plain
fact
of
the
case
is
that
such
powers
are
absolutely
incapable
of
uttering
an
effective
protest
against
war
far
less
so
are
your
haytis
and
liberias
the
preservation
of
the
rests
with
the
great
powers
and
with
the
great
powers
alone
if
they
have
the
will
for
peace
it
is
peace
if
they
have
not
it
is
conflict
the
four
powers
i
have
named
can
now
if
they
see
fit
dictate
the
peace
of
the
world
for
ever
let
us
keep
our
grip
on
that
peace
is
the
business
of
the
great
powers
primarily
steel
output
university
graduates
and
so
forth
may
be
convenient
secondary
criteria
may
be
useful
ways
of
measuring
war
efficiency
but
the
meat
and
substance
of
the
council
of
the
league
of
nations
must
embody
the
wills
of
those
leading
peoples
they
can
give
an
enduring
peace
to
the
little
nations
and
the
whole
of
mankind
it
can
arrive
in
no
other
way
so
i
take
it
that
the
council
of
an
ideal
league
of
nations
must
consist
chiefly
of
the
representatives
of
the
great
belligerent
powers
and
that
the
representatives
of
the
minor
allies
and
of
the
neutrals
essential
though
their
presence
will
be
must
not
be
allowed
to
swamp
the
voices
of
these
larger
masses
of
mankind
and
this
state
of
affairs
may
come
about
more
easily
than
logical
people
may
be
disposed
to
think
our
first
impulse
when
we
discuss
the
league
of
nations
idea
is
to
think
of
some
very
elaborate
and
definite
scheme
of
members
on
the
model
of
existing
legislative
bodies
called
together
one
hardly
knows
how
and
sitting
in
a
specially
built
league
of
nations
congress
house
all
schemes
are
more
methodical
than
reality
we
think
of
somebody
learned
and
expert
in
spectacles
with
a
thin
clear
voice
reading
over
the
projected
constitution
of
a
league
of
nations
to
an
attentive
and
respectful
peace
congress
but
there
is
a
more
natural
way
to
a
league
than
that
instead
of
being
made
like
a
machine
the
league
of
nations
may
come
about
like
a
marriage
the
peace
congress
that
must
sooner
or
later
meet
may
itself
become
after
a
time
the
council
of
a
league
of
nations
the
league
of
nations
may
come
upon
us
by
degrees
almost
imperceptibly
i
am
strongly
obsessed
by
the
idea
that
that
peace
congress
will
necessarily
become
and
that
it
is
highly
desirable
that
it
should
become
a
most
prolonged
and
persistent
gathering
why
should
it
not
become
at
length
a
permanent
gathering
inviting
representatives
to
aid
its
deliberations
from
the
neutral
states
and
gradually
adjusting
itself
to
conditions
of
permanency
i
can
conceive
no
such
peace
congress
as
those
that
have
settled
up
after
other
wars
settling
up
after
this
war
not
only
has
the
war
been
enormously
bigger
than
any
other
war
but
it
has
struck
deeper
at
the
foundations
of
social
and
economic
life
i
doubt
if
we
begin
to
realize
how
much
of
the
old
system
is
dead
how
much
has
to
be
remade
since
the
beginnings
of
history
there
has
been
a
credible
promise
of
gold
payments
underneath
our
financial
arrangements
it
is
now
an
incredible
promise
the
value
of
a
pound
note
waves
about
while
you
look
at
it
what
will
happen
to
it
when
peace
comes
no
man
can
tell
nor
what
will
happen
to
the
mark
the
rouble
has
gone
into
the
abyss
our
giddy
money
specialists
clutch
their
handfuls
of
paper
and
watch
it
flying
down
the
steep
much
as
we
may
hate
the
germans
some
of
us
will
have
to
sit
down
with
some
of
the
enemy
to
arrange
a
common
scheme
for
the
preservation
of
credit
in
money
and
i
presume
that
it
is
not
proposed
to
end
this
war
in
a
wild
scramble
of
buyers
for
such
food
as
remains
in
the
world
there
is
a
shortage
now
a
greater
shortage
ahead
of
the
world
and
there
will
be
shortages
of
supply
at
the
source
and
transport
in
food
and
all
raw
materials
for
some
years
to
come
the
peace
congress
will
have
to
sit
and
organize
a
and
distribution
and
reorganization
of
these
shattered
supplies
it
will
have
to
rhondda
the
nations
probably
too
we
shall
have
to
deal
collectively
with
a
pestilence
before
we
are
out
of
the
mess
then
there
are
such
little
jobs
as
the
reconstruction
of
belgium
and
serbia
there
are
considerable
rectifications
of
boundaries
to
be
made
there
are
fresh
states
to
be
created
in
poland
and
armenia
for
example
about
all
these
smaller
states
new
and
old
that
the
peace
must
call
into
being
there
must
be
a
system
of
guarantees
of
the
most
difficult
and
complicated
sort
i
do
not
see
the
press
congress
getting
through
such
matters
as
these
in
a
session
of
weeks
or
months
the
idea
the
germans
betrayed
at
brest
that
things
were
going
to
be
done
in
the
versailles
fashion
by
great
moustached
heroes
frowning
and
drawing
lines
with
a
large
black
soldierly
thumbnail
across
maps
is
they
have
made
their
eastern
treaties
it
is
true
in
this
mode
but
they
are
still
looking
for
some
really
responsible
government
to
keep
them
now
that
they
are
made
from
first
to
last
clearly
the
main
peace
negotiations
are
going
to
follow
unprecedented
courses
this
preliminary
discussion
of
war
aims
by
means
of
great
public
speeches
that
has
been
getting
more
and
more
explicit
now
for
many
months
is
quite
unprecedented
apparently
all
the
broad
preliminaries
are
to
be
stated
and
accepted
in
the
sight
of
all
mankind
before
even
an
armistice
occurs
on
the
main
the
western
front
the
german
diplomatists
hate
this
process
so
do
a
lot
of
ours
so
do
some
of
the
diplomatic
frenchmen
the
german
junkers
are
dodging
and
lying
they
are
fighting
desperately
to
keep
back
everything
they
possibly
can
for
the
bargaining
and
bullying
and
of
the
council
chamber
but
that
way
there
is
no
peace
and
when
at
last
germany
says
snip
sufficiently
to
the
allies
snap
and
the
peace
congress
begins
it
will
almost
certainly
be
as
unprecedented
as
its
prelude
before
it
meets
the
broad
lines
of
the
settlement
will
have
been
drawn
plainly
with
the
approval
of
the
mass
of
mankind
ii
the
league
must
be
representative
a
peace
congress
growing
permanent
then
may
prove
to
be
the
most
practical
and
convenient
embodiment
of
this
idea
of
a
league
of
nations
that
has
taken
possession
of
the
imagination
of
the
world
a
most
necessary
preliminary
to
a
peace
congress
with
such
possibilities
inherent
in
it
must
obviously
be
the
meeting
and
organization
of
a
preliminary
league
of
the
allied
nations
that
point
i
would
now
enlarge
half
a
world
peace
is
better
than
none
there
seems
no
reason
whatever
why
the
world
should
wait
for
the
central
powers
before
it
begins
this
necessary
work
mccurdy
has
been
asking
lately
why
not
the
league
of
nations
that
is
a
question
a
great
number
of
people
would
like
to
echo
very
heartily
the
nearer
the
allies
can
come
to
a
league
of
free
nations
before
the
peace
congress
the
more
prospect
there
is
that
that
body
will
approximate
in
nature
to
a
league
of
nations
for
the
whole
world
in
one
most
unexpected
quarter
the
same
idea
has
been
endorsed
the
king
speech
on
the
prorogation
of
parliament
this
february
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
royal
utterances
that
have
ever
been
made
from
the
british
throne
there
was
less
of
the
king
and
more
of
the
modern
president
about
it
than
the
most
of
us
could
have
anticipated
for
the
first
time
in
a
king
speech
we
heard
of
the
democracies
of
the
world
and
there
was
a
clear
claim
that
the
allies
at
present
fighting
the
central
powers
did
themselves
constitute
a
league
of
nations
but
we
must
admit
that
at
present
they
do
so
only
in
a
very
rhetorical
sense
there
is
no
real
council
of
empowered
representatives
and
nothing
in
the
nature
of
a
united
front
has
been
prepared
unless
we
provide
beforehand
for
something
more
effective
italy
france
the
united
states
japan
and
this
country
will
send
separate
groups
of
representatives
with
separate
instructions
unequal
status
and
very
probably
conflicting
views
upon
many
subjects
to
the
ultimate
peace
discussions
it
is
quite
conceivable
it
is
a
very
serious
danger
that
at
this
discussion
skilful
diplomacy
on
the
part
of
the
central
powers
may
open
a
cleft
among
the
allies
that
has
never
appeared
during
the
actual
war
have
the
british
settled
for
example
with
italy
and
france
for
the
supply
of
metallurgical
coal
after
the
war
those
countries
must
have
it
somehow
across
the
board
germany
can
make
some
tempting
bids
in
that
respect
or
take
another
question
have
the
british
arrived
at
common
views
with
france
belgium
portugal
and
south
africa
about
the
administration
of
central
africa
suppose
germany
makes
sudden
proposals
affecting
native
labour
that
win
over
the
portuguese
and
the
boers
there
are
a
score
of
such
points
upon
which
we
shall
find
the
allied
representatives
haggling
with
each
other
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
if
they
have
not
been
settled
beforehand
it
is
the
plainest
common
sense
that
we
should
be
fixing
up
all
such
matters
with
our
allies
now
and
knitting
together
a
common
front
for
the
final
deal
with
german
imperialism
and
these
things
are
not
to
be
done
effectively
and
bindingly
nowadays
by
official
gentlemen
in
discreet
undertones
they
need
to
be
done
with
the
full
knowledge
and
authority
of
the
participating
peoples
the
russian
example
has
taught
the
world
the
instability
of
diplomatic
bargains
in
a
time
of
such
fundamental
issues
as
the
present
there
is
little
hope
and
little
strength
in
bargainings
between
the
officials
or
politicians
who
happen
to
be
at
the
head
of
this
or
that
nation
for
the
time
being
our
labour
people
will
not
stand
this
sort
of
thing
and
they
will
not
be
bound
by
it
there
will
be
the
plain
danger
of
repudiation
for
all
arrangements
made
in
that
fashion
a
gathering
of
somebody
or
other
approved
by
the
british
foreign
office
and
of
somebody
or
other
approved
by
the
french
foreign
office
of
somebody
with
vague
powers
from
america
and
so
on
and
so
on
will
be
an
entirely
ineffective
gathering
but
that
is
the
sort
of
gathering
of
the
allies
we
have
been
having
hitherto
and
that
is
the
sort
of
gathering
that
is
likely
to
continue
unless
there
is
a
considerable
expression
of
opinion
in
favour
of
something
more
representative
and
responsible
even
our
foreign
office
must
be
aware
that
in
every
country
in
the
world
there
is
now
bitter
suspicion
of
and
keen
hostility
towards
merely
diplomatic
representatives
one
of
the
most
significant
features
of
the
time
is
the
evident
desire
of
the
labour
movement
in
every
european
country
to
take
part
in
a
collateral
conference
of
labour
that
shall
meet
when
and
where
the
peace
congress
does
and
deliberate
and
comment
on
its
proceedings
for
a
year
now
the
demand
of
the
masses
for
such
a
labour
conference
has
been
growing
it
marks
a
distrust
of
officialdom
whose
intensity
officialdom
would
do
well
to
ponder
but
it
is
the
natural
consequence
of
it
is
the
popular
attempt
at
a
corrective
to
the
aloofness
and
obscurity
that
have
hitherto
been
so
evil
a
characteristic
of
international
negotiations
i
do
not
think
labour
and
intelligent
people
anywhere
are
going
to
be
fobbed
off
with
an
diplomatic
gathering
as
being
that
league
of
free
nations
they
demand
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
contemplate
this
conference
with
the
diplomatists
trying
to
best
and
humbug
the
labour
people
as
well
as
each
other
and
the
labour
people
getting
more
and
more
irritated
suspicious
and
extremist
with
anything
but
dread
the
allied
countries
must
go
into
the
conference
and
they
can
only
hope
to
do
that
by
heeding
and
incorporating
labour
ideas
before
they
come
to
the
conference
the
only
alternative
that
i
can
see
to
this
unsatisfactory
prospect
of
a
peace
congress
sitting
side
by
side
with
a
dissentient
and
probably
revolutionary
labour
and
socialist
convention
both
gatherings
with
unsatisfactory
credentials
contradicting
one
another
and
drifting
to
opposite
extremes
is
that
the
delegates
the
allied
powers
send
to
the
peace
conference
the
same
delegates
which
if
they
are
wise
they
will
have
previously
sent
to
a
preliminary
league
of
allied
nations
to
discuss
their
common
action
at
the
peace
congress
should
be
elected
upon
democratic
lines
i
know
that
this
will
be
a
very
shocking
proposal
to
all
our
able
specialists
in
foreign
policy
they
will
talk
at
once
about
the
ignorance
of
people
like
the
labour
leaders
and
myself
about
such
matters
and
so
on
what
do
we
know
of
the
treaty
of
that
was
signed
in
the
year
seventeen
something
and
so
on
to
which
the
answer
is
that
we
ought
not
to
have
been
kept
ignorant
of
these
things
a
day
will
come
when
the
foreign
offices
of
all
countries
will
have
to
recognize
that
what
the
people
do
not
know
of
international
agreements
ai
facts
a
secret
treaty
is
only
binding
upon
the
persons
in
the
secret
but
what
i
as
a
sample
common
person
am
not
ignorant
of
is
this
that
the
business
that
goes
on
at
the
peace
congress
will
either
make
or
mar
the
lives
of
everyone
i
care
for
in
the
world
and
that
somehow
by
representative
or
what
not
have
to
be
the
peace
congress
deals
with
the
blood
and
happiness
of
my
children
and
the
future
of
my
world
speaking
as
one
of
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
rank
outsiders
in
public
affairs
i
do
not
mean
to
respect
any
peace
treaty
that
may
end
this
war
unless
i
am
honestly
represented
at
its
making
i
think
everywhere
there
is
a
tendency
in
people
to
follow
the
russian
example
to
this
extent
and
to
repudiate
bargains
in
which
they
have
had
no
voice
i
do
not
see
that
any
genuine
realization
of
the
hopes
with
which
all
this
talk
about
the
league
of
nations
is
charged
can
be
possible
unless
the
two
bodies
which
should
naturally
lead
up
to
the
league
of
nations
that
is
to
say
firstly
the
conference
of
the
allies
and
then
the
peace
congress
are
elected
bodies
speaking
confidently
for
the
whole
mass
of
the
peoples
behind
them
it
may
be
a
troublesome
thing
to
elect
them
but
it
will
involve
much
more
troublesome
consequences
if
they
are
not
elected
this
i
think
is
one
of
the
considerations
for
which
many
people
minds
are
still
unprepared
but
unless
we
are
to
have
over
again
after
all
this
bloodshed
and
effort
some
such
peace
with
honour
foolery
as
we
had
performed
by
dizzy
and
salisbury
at
that
fatal
berlin
conference
in
which
this
present
war
was
begotten
we
must
sit
up
to
this
novel
proposal
of
electoral
representation
in
the
peace
negotiations
something
more
than
common
sense
binds
our
statesmen
to
this
idea
they
are
morally
pledged
to
it
president
wilson
and
our
british
and
french
spokesmen
alike
have
said
over
and
over
again
that
they
want
to
deal
not
with
the
hohenzollerns
but
with
the
german
people
in
other
words
we
have
demanded
elected
representatives
from
the
german
people
with
whom
we
may
deal
and
how
can
we
make
a
demand
of
that
sort
unless
we
on
our
part
are
already
prepared
to
send
our
own
elected
representatives
to
meet
them
it
is
up
to
us
to
indicate
by
our
own
practice
how
we
on
our
side
professing
as
we
do
to
act
for
democracies
to
make
democracy
safe
on
the
earth
and
so
on
intend
to
meet
this
new
occasion
yet
it
has
to
be
remarked
that
so
far
not
one
of
the
league
of
nations
projects
i
have
seen
have
included
any
practicable
proposals
for
the
appointment
of
delegates
either
to
that
ultimate
body
or
to
its
two
necessary
predecessors
the
council
of
the
allies
and
the
peace
congress
it
is
evident
that
here
again
we
are
neglecting
to
get
on
with
something
of
very
urgent
importance
i
will
venture
therefore
to
say
a
word
or
two
here
about
the
possible
way
in
which
a
modern
community
may
appoint
its
international
representatives
and
here
again
i
turn
from
any
european
precedents
to
that
political
outcome
of
the
british
mind
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
because
we
must
always
remember
that
while
our
political
institutions
in
britain
are
a
of
feudalism
tudor
stuart
and
hanoverian
monarchist
traditions
and
urgent
merely
european
necessities
a
that
has
been
made
in
a
series
of
the
american
constitution
is
a
real
deliberate
creation
of
the
intelligence
the
president
of
the
united
states
then
we
have
to
note
is
elected
in
a
most
extraordinary
way
and
in
a
way
that
has
now
the
justification
of
very
great
successes
indeed
on
several
occasions
the
united
states
has
achieved
indisputable
greatness
in
its
presidents
and
very
rarely
has
it
failed
to
set
up
very
leaderly
and
distinguished
men
it
is
worth
while
therefore
to
inquire
how
this
president
is
elected
he
is
neither
elected
directly
by
the
people
nor
appointed
by
any
legislative
body
he
is
chosen
by
a
special
college
elected
by
the
people
this
college
exists
to
elect
him
it
meets
elects
him
and
disperses
i
will
not
here
go
into
the
preliminary
complications
that
makes
the
election
of
a
president
follow
upon
a
preliminary
election
of
two
presidential
candidates
the
point
i
am
making
here
is
that
he
is
a
specially
selected
man
chosen
is
there
any
reason
why
we
should
not
adopt
this
method
in
this
new
necessity
we
are
under
of
sending
representatives
first
to
the
long
overdue
and
necessary
allied
council
then
to
the
peace
congress
and
then
to
the
council
of
the
league
of
nations
i
am
anxious
here
only
to
start
for
discussion
the
idea
of
an
electoral
representation
of
the
nations
upon
these
three
bodies
that
must
in
succession
set
themselves
to
define
organize
and
maintain
the
peace
of
the
world
i
do
not
wish
to
complicate
the
question
by
any
too
explicit
advocacy
of
methods
of
election
or
the
like
in
the
united
states
this
college
which
elects
the
president
is
elected
on
the
same
register
of
voters
as
that
which
elects
the
senate
and
congress
and
at
the
same
time
but
i
suppose
if
we
are
to
give
a
popular
mandate
to
the
three
or
five
or
twelve
or
twenty
or
whatever
number
it
is
men
to
whom
we
are
going
to
entrust
our
empire
share
in
this
great
task
of
the
peace
negotiations
it
will
be
more
decisive
of
the
will
of
the
whole
nation
if
the
college
that
had
to
appoint
them
is
elected
at
a
special
election
i
suppose
that
the
great
british
at
present
not
represented
in
parliament
would
also
and
separately
at
the
same
time
elect
colleges
to
appoint
their
representatives
i
suppose
there
would
be
at
least
one
indian
representative
elected
perhaps
by
some
special
electoral
conference
of
indian
princes
and
leading
men
the
chief
defect
of
the
american
presidential
election
is
that
as
the
old
single
vote
method
of
election
is
employed
it
has
to
be
fought
on
purely
party
lines
he
is
the
select
man
of
the
democratic
half
or
of
the
republican
half
of
the
nation
he
is
not
the
select
man
of
the
whole
nation
it
would
give
a
far
more
representative
character
to
the
electoral
college
if
it
could
be
elected
by
fair
modern
methods
if
for
this
particular
purpose
parliamentary
constituencies
could
be
grouped
and
the
clean
scientific
method
of
proportional
representation
could
be
used
but
i
suppose
the
party
politician
in
this
as
in
most
of
our
affairs
must
still
have
his
pound
of
our
flesh
and
we
must
reckon
with
him
later
for
the
bloodshed
these
are
all
however
secondary
considerations
the
above
paragraph
is
so
to
speak
in
the
nature
of
a
footnote
the
fundamental
matter
if
we
are
to
get
towards
any
realization
of
this
ideal
of
a
world
peace
sustained
by
a
league
of
nations
is
to
get
straight
away
to
the
conception
of
direct
special
electoral
mandates
in
this
matter
at
present
all
the
political
luncheon
and
dinner
parties
in
london
are
busy
with
smirking
discussions
of
who
is
to
go
the
titled
ladies
are
particularly
busy
they
are
talking
about
it
as
if
we
poor
ignorant
common
people
did
not
exist
they
say
will
of
course
on
going
but
there
is
much
talk
of
the
old
man
people
are
getting
quite
nice
again
about
the
old
feelings
it
would
be
such
a
pretty
thing
to
send
him
but
if
goes
we
want
him
to
go
with
something
more
than
a
backing
of
intrigues
and
snatched
authority
and
i
do
not
think
the
mass
of
people
have
any
enthusiasm
for
the
old
man
it
is
difficult
again
by
the
standards
to
know
how
lord
curzon
can
be
restrained
but
we
common
people
do
not
care
if
he
is
restrained
to
the
point
of
extinction
probably
there
will
be
nobody
who
talks
or
understands
russian
among
the
british
representatives
but
of
course
the
british
governing
class
has
washed
its
hands
of
the
russians
they
were
always
very
difficult
and
now
they
are
impossible
my
dear
perfectly
impossible
no
that
sort
of
thing
will
not
do
now
this
peace
congress
is
too
big
a
job
for
party
politicians
and
society
and
county
families
the
bulk
of
british
opinion
can
not
go
on
being
represented
for
ever
by
president
wilson
we
can
not
always
look
to
the
americans
to
express
our
ideas
and
do
our
work
for
democracy
the
foolery
of
the
berlin
treaty
must
not
be
repeated
we
can
not
have
another
popular
prime
minister
come
triumphing
back
to
england
with
a
gross
of
pink
spectacles
through
which
we
may
survey
the
prospect
of
the
next
great
war
the
league
of
free
nations
means
something
very
big
and
solid
it
is
not
a
rhetorical
phrase
to
be
used
to
pacify
a
restless
distressed
and
anxious
public
and
to
be
sneered
out
of
existence
when
that
use
is
past
when
the
popular
mind
now
demands
a
league
of
free
nations
it
demands
a
reality
the
only
way
to
that
reality
is
through
the
direct
participation
of
the
nation
as
a
whole
in
the
settlement
and
that
is
possible
only
through
the
direct
election
for
this
particular
issue
of
representative
and
responsible
men
iii
the
necessary
powers
of
the
league
if
this
phrase
the
league
of
free
nations
is
to
signify
anything
more
than
a
rhetorical
flourish
then
certain
consequences
follow
that
have
to
be
faced
now
no
man
can
join
a
partnership
and
remain
an
absolutely
free
man
you
can
not
bind
yourself
to
do
this
and
not
to
do
that
and
to
consult
and
act
with
your
associates
in
certain
eventualities
without
a
loss
of
your
sovereign
freedom
people
in
this
country
and
in
france
do
not
seem
to
be
sitting
up
manfully
to
these
necessary
propositions
if
this
league
of
free
nations
is
really
to
be
an
effectual
thing
for
the
preservation
of
the
peace
of
the
world
it
must
possess
power
and
exercise
power
powers
must
be
delegated
to
it
otherwise
it
will
only
help
with
all
other
good
resolutions
to
pave
the
road
of
mankind
to
hell
nothing
in
all
the
world
so
strengthens
evil
as
the
attempts
of
good
to
make
good
it
scarcely
needs
repeating
here
it
has
been
so
generally
said
that
no
league
of
free
nations
can
hope
to
keep
the
peace
unless
every
member
of
it
is
indeed
a
free
member
represented
by
duly
elected
persons
nobody
of
course
asks
to
dictate
the
internal
government
of
any
country
to
that
country
if
germans
for
instance
like
to
wallow
in
absolutism
after
the
war
they
can
do
so
but
if
they
or
any
other
peoples
wish
to
take
part
in
a
permanent
league
of
free
nations
it
is
only
reasonable
to
insist
that
so
far
as
their
representatives
on
the
council
go
they
must
be
duly
elected
under
conditions
that
are
by
the
standards
of
the
general
league
satisfactorily
democratic
that
seems
to
be
only
the
common
sense
of
the
matter
every
court
is
a
potential
conspiracy
against
freedom
and
the
league
can
not
tolerate
merely
court
appointments
if
courts
are
to
exist
anywhere
in
the
new
world
of
the
future
they
will
be
wise
to
stand
aloof
from
international
meddling
of
course
if
a
people
after
due
provision
for
electoral
representation
choose
to
elect
dynastic
candidates
that
is
an
altogether
different
matter
and
now
let
us
consider
what
are
the
powers
that
must
be
delegated
to
this
proposed
council
of
a
league
of
free
nations
if
that
is
really
effectually
to
prevent
war
and
to
organize
and
establish
and
make
peace
permanent
in
the
world
firstly
then
it
must
be
able
to
adjudicate
upon
all
international
disputes
whatever
its
first
function
must
clearly
be
that
before
a
war
can
break
out
there
must
be
the
possibility
of
a
world
decision
upon
its
rights
and
wrongs
the
league
therefore
will
have
as
its
primary
function
to
maintain
a
supreme
court
whose
decisions
will
be
final
before
which
every
sovereign
power
may
appear
as
plaintiff
against
any
other
sovereign
power
or
group
of
powers
the
plea
i
take
it
will
always
be
in
the
form
that
the
defendant
power
or
powers
is
engaged
in
proceedings
calculated
to
lead
to
a
breach
of
the
peace
and
calling
upon
the
league
for
an
injunction
against
such
proceedings
i
suppose
the
proceedings
that
can
be
brought
into
court
in
this
way
fall
under
such
headings
as
these
that
follow
restraint
of
trade
by
injurious
tariffs
or
suchlike
differentiations
or
by
interference
with
through
traffic
improper
treatment
of
the
subjects
their
here
i
put
a
query
of
the
plaintiff
nation
in
the
defendant
state
aggressive
military
or
naval
preparation
disorder
spreading
over
the
frontier
trespass
as
for
instance
by
airships
propaganda
of
disorder
espionage
permitting
the
organization
of
injurious
activities
such
as
raids
or
piracy
clearly
all
such
actions
must
come
within
the
purview
of
any
court
organized
to
prevent
war
but
in
addition
there
is
a
more
doubtful
and
delicate
class
of
case
arising
out
of
the
discontent
of
patches
of
one
race
or
religion
in
the
dominions
of
another
how
far
may
the
supreme
court
of
the
world
attend
to
grievances
between
subject
and
sovereign
such
cases
are
highly
probable
and
no
large
vague
propositions
about
the
of
peoples
can
meet
all
the
cases
in
macedonia
for
instance
there
is
a
jumble
of
albanian
serbian
bulgarian
greek
and
rumanian
villages
always
jostling
one
another
and
maintaining
an
intense
irritation
between
the
kindred
nations
close
at
hand
and
quite
a
large
number
of
areas
and
cities
in
the
world
it
has
to
be
remembered
are
not
homogeneous
at
all
will
the
great
nations
of
the
world
have
the
to
permit
a
scattered
subject
population
to
appeal
against
the
treatment
of
its
ruling
power
to
the
supreme
court
this
is
a
much
more
serious
interference
with
sovereignty
than
intervention
in
an
external
quarrel
could
a
greek
village
in
bulgarian
macedonia
plead
in
the
supreme
court
could
the
armenians
in
constantinople
or
the
jews
in
roumania
or
the
poles
in
west
prussia
or
the
negroes
in
georgia
or
the
indians
in
the
transvaal
make
such
an
appeal
could
any
indian
population
in
india
appeal
personally
i
should
like
to
see
the
power
of
the
supreme
court
extend
as
far
as
this
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
possibly
prevent
a
kindred
nation
pleading
for
the
scattered
people
of
its
own
race
and
culture
or
any
nation
presenting
a
case
on
behalf
of
some
otherwise
unrepresented
people
the
united
states
for
example
presenting
a
case
on
behalf
of
the
armenians
but
i
doubt
if
many
people
have
made
up
their
minds
yet
to
see
the
powers
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
league
of
nations
go
so
far
as
this
i
doubt
if
to
begin
with
it
will
be
possible
to
provide
for
these
cases
i
would
like
to
see
it
done
but
i
doubt
if
the
majority
of
the
sovereign
peoples
concerned
will
reconcile
their
national
pride
with
the
idea
at
least
so
far
as
their
own
subject
populations
go
here
you
see
i
do
no
more
than
ask
a
question
it
is
a
difficult
one
and
it
has
to
be
answered
before
we
can
clear
the
way
to
the
league
of
free
nations
but
the
supreme
court
whether
it
is
to
have
the
wider
or
the
narrower
scope
here
suggested
would
be
merely
the
central
function
of
the
league
of
free
nations
behind
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
must
lie
power
and
here
come
fresh
difficulties
for
patriotic
digestions
the
armies
and
navies
of
the
world
must
be
at
the
disposal
of
the
league
of
free
nations
and
that
opens
up
a
new
large
area
of
delegated
authority
the
first
impulse
of
any
power
disposed
to
challenge
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
will
be
of
course
to
arm
and
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
the
league
of
free
nations
can
exercise
any
practical
authority
unless
it
has
power
to
restrain
such
armament
the
league
of
free
nations
must
in
fact
if
it
is
to
be
a
working
reality
have
power
to
define
and
limit
the
military
and
naval
and
aerial
equipment
of
every
country
in
the
world
this
means
something
more
than
a
restriction
of
state
forces
it
must
have
power
and
freedom
to
investigate
the
military
and
naval
and
aerial
establishments
of
all
its
constituent
powers
it
must
also
have
effective
control
over
every
armament
industry
and
armament
industries
are
not
always
easy
to
define
are
aeroplanes
for
example
armament
its
powers
i
suggest
must
extend
even
to
a
restraint
upon
the
belligerent
propaganda
which
is
the
natural
advertisement
campaign
of
every
armament
industry
it
must
have
the
right
for
example
to
raise
the
question
of
the
proprietorship
of
newspapers
by
armament
interests
disarmament
is
in
fact
a
necessary
factor
of
any
league
of
free
nations
and
you
can
not
have
disarmament
unless
you
are
prepared
to
see
the
powers
of
the
council
of
the
league
extend
thus
far
the
very
existence
of
the
league
presupposes
that
it
and
it
alone
is
to
have
and
to
exercise
military
force
any
other
belligerency
or
preparation
or
incitement
to
belligerency
becomes
rebellion
and
any
other
arming
a
threat
of
rebellion
in
a
world
league
of
free
nations
but
here
again
has
the
general
mind
yet
thought
out
all
that
is
involved
in
this
proposition
in
all
the
great
belligerent
countries
the
armament
industries
are
now
huge
interests
with
enormous
powers
business
alone
is
as
powerful
a
thing
in
germany
as
the
crown
in
every
country
a
heavily
subsidized
patriotic
press
will
fight
desperately
against
giving
powers
so
extensive
and
thorough
as
those
here
suggested
to
an
international
body
so
long
of
course
as
the
league
of
free
nations
remains
a
project
in
the
air
without
body
or
parts
such
a
press
will
sneer
at
it
gently
as
utopian
and
even
patronize
it
kindly
but
so
soon
as
the
league
takes
on
the
shape
its
general
proposition
makes
logically
necessary
the
armament
interest
will
take
fright
then
it
is
we
shall
hear
the
drum
patriotic
loud
in
defence
of
the
human
blood
trade
are
we
to
hand
over
these
most
intimate
affairs
of
ours
to
a
lot
of
foreigners
among
these
foreigners
who
will
be
appealed
to
to
terrify
the
patriotic
souls
of
the
british
will
be
the
americans
are
we
men
of
english
blood
and
tradition
to
see
our
affairs
controlled
by
such
foreigners
as
wilson
lincoln
webster
and
washington
perish
the
thought
when
they
might
be
controlled
by
disraelis
wettins
and
what
not
and
so
on
and
so
on
krupp
agents
and
the
agents
of
the
kindred
firms
in
great
britain
and
france
will
also
be
very
busy
with
the
national
pride
of
france
in
germany
they
have
already
created
a
colossal
suspicion
of
england
here
is
a
giant
in
the
path
but
let
us
remember
that
it
is
only
necessary
to
defeat
the
propaganda
of
this
vile
and
dangerous
industry
in
four
great
countries
and
for
the
common
citizen
touched
on
the
tenderest
part
of
his
patriotic
susceptibilities
there
are
certain
irrefutable
arguments
whether
the
ways
of
the
world
in
the
years
to
come
are
to
be
the
paths
of
peace
or
the
paths
of
war
is
not
going
to
alter
this
essential
fact
that
the
great
educated
world
communities
with
a
social
and
industrial
organization
on
a
scale
are
going
to
dominate
human
affairs
whether
they
spend
their
power
in
killing
or
in
educating
and
creating
france
germany
however
much
we
may
resent
it
the
two
great
communities
italy
japan
china
and
presently
perhaps
a
renascent
russia
are
jointly
going
to
control
the
destinies
of
mankind
whether
that
joint
control
comes
through
arms
or
through
the
law
is
a
secondary
consideration
to
refuse
to
bring
our
affairs
into
a
common
council
does
not
make
us
independent
of
foreigners
it
makes
us
more
dependent
upon
them
as
a
very
little
consideration
will
show
i
am
suggesting
here
that
the
league
of
free
nations
shall
practically
control
the
army
navy
air
forces
and
armament
industry
of
every
nation
in
the
world
what
is
the
alternative
to
that
to
do
as
we
please
no
the
alternative
is
that
any
malignant
country
will
be
free
to
force
upon
all
the
rest
just
the
maximum
amount
of
armament
it
chooses
to
adopt
since
france
we
say
has
been
free
in
military
matters
what
has
been
the
value
of
that
freedom
the
truth
is
she
has
been
the
of
germany
bound
to
watch
germany
as
a
slave
watches
a
master
bound
to
launch
submarine
for
submarine
and
cast
gun
for
gun
to
sweep
all
her
youth
into
her
army
to
subdue
her
trade
her
literature
her
education
her
whole
life
to
the
necessity
of
preparations
imposed
upon
her
by
her
over
the
rhine
and
michael
too
has
been
a
slave
to
his
imperial
master
for
the
reason
for
the
reason
that
germany
and
france
were
both
so
proudly
sovereign
and
independent
both
countries
have
been
slaves
to
kruppism
and
zabernism
they
were
sovereign
and
so
it
will
always
be
so
long
as
patriotic
cant
can
keep
the
common
man
jealous
of
international
controls
over
his
belligerent
possibilities
so
long
will
he
be
the
helpless
slave
of
the
foreign
threat
and
peace
remain
a
mere
name
for
the
resting
phase
between
wars
but
power
over
the
military
resources
of
the
world
is
by
no
means
the
limit
of
the
necessary
powers
of
an
effective
league
of
free
nations
there
are
still
more
indigestible
implications
in
the
idea
and
since
they
have
got
to
be
digested
sooner
or
later
if
civilization
is
not
to
collapse
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
begin
to
bite
upon
them
now
i
was
much
interested
to
read
the
british
press
upon
the
alleged
proposal
of
the
german
chancellor
that
we
should
give
up
presumably
to
germany
gibraltar
malta
egypt
and
suchlike
key
possessions
it
seemed
to
excite
several
of
our
politicians
extremely
i
read
over
the
german
chancellor
speech
very
carefully
so
far
as
it
was
available
and
it
is
clear
that
he
did
not
propose
anything
of
the
sort
wilfully
or
blindly
our
press
and
our
demagogues
screamed
over
a
false
issue
the
chancellor
was
defending
the
idea
of
the
germans
remaining
in
belgium
and
lorraine
because
of
the
strategic
and
economic
importance
of
those
regions
to
germany
and
he
was
arguing
that
before
we
english
got
into
such
a
feverish
state
of
indignation
about
that
we
should
first
ask
ourselves
what
we
were
doing
in
gibraltar
etc
that
is
a
different
thing
altogether
and
it
is
an
argument
that
is
not
to
be
disposed
of
by
misrepresentation
the
british
have
to
think
hard
over
this
quite
legitimate
german
it
is
no
good
getting
into
a
patriotic
bad
temper
and
refusing
to
answer
that
question
we
british
people
are
so
persuaded
of
the
purity
and
unselfishness
with
which
we
discharge
our
imperial
responsibilities
we
have
been
so
trained
in
imperial
we
know
so
certainly
that
all
our
subject
nations
call
us
blessed
that
it
is
a
little
difficult
for
us
to
see
just
how
the
fact
that
we
are
for
example
so
deeply
rooted
in
egypt
looks
to
an
outside
intelligence
of
course
the
german
imperialist
idea
is
a
wicked
and
aggressive
idea
as
lord
robert
cecil
has
explained
they
want
to
set
up
all
over
the
earth
coaling
stations
and
strategic
points
the
pattern
of
well
they
argue
we
are
only
trying
to
do
what
you
british
have
done
if
we
are
not
to
do
so
because
it
is
aggression
and
so
on
and
so
on
is
not
the
time
ripe
for
you
to
make
some
concessions
to
the
public
opinion
of
the
world
that
is
the
german
argument
either
they
say
tolerate
this
idea
of
a
germany
with
advantageous
posts
and
possessions
round
and
about
the
earth
or
reconsider
your
own
position
well
at
the
risk
of
rousing
much
patriotic
wrath
i
must
admit
that
i
think
we
to
reconsider
our
position
our
argument
is
that
in
india
egypt
africa
and
elsewhere
we
stand
for
order
and
civilization
we
are
the
trustees
of
freedom
the
agents
of
knowledge
and
efficiency
on
the
whole
the
record
of
british
rule
is
a
pretty
respectable
one
i
am
not
ashamed
of
our
record
nevertheless
case
is
it
is
quite
justifiable
for
us
british
no
doubt
if
we
do
really
play
the
part
of
honest
trustees
to
remain
in
egypt
and
in
india
under
existing
conditions
it
is
even
possible
for
us
to
glance
at
the
helplessness
of
arabia
palestine
and
mesopotamia
as
yet
incapable
of
helpless
as
infants
but
our
case
our
only
justifiable
case
is
that
we
are
trustees
because
there
is
no
better
trustee
possible
and
the
creation
of
a
council
of
a
league
of
free
nations
would
be
like
the
creation
of
a
public
trustee
for
the
world
the
creation
of
a
league
of
free
nations
must
necessarily
be
the
creation
of
an
authority
that
may
legitimately
call
existing
empires
to
give
an
account
of
their
stewardship
for
an
unchecked
fragmentary
control
of
tropical
and
chaotic
regions
it
substitutes
the
possibility
of
a
general
authority
and
this
must
necessarily
alter
the
problems
not
only
of
the
politically
immature
nations
and
the
control
of
the
tropics
but
also
of
the
regulation
of
the
sea
ways
the
regulation
of
the
coming
air
routes
and
the
distribution
of
staple
products
in
the
world
i
will
not
go
in
detail
over
the
items
of
this
list
because
the
reader
can
fill
in
the
essentials
of
the
argument
from
what
has
gone
before
i
want
simply
to
suggest
how
widely
this
project
of
a
league
of
free
nations
swings
when
once
you
have
let
it
swing
freely
in
your
mind
and
if
you
do
not
let
it
swing
freely
in
your
mind
it
remains
nothing
a
sentimental
gesture
the
plain
truth
is
that
the
league
of
free
nations
if
it
is
to
be
a
reality
if
it
is
to
effect
a
real
pacification
of
the
world
must
do
no
less
than
supersede
empire
it
must
end
not
only
this
new
german
imperialism
which
is
struggling
so
savagely
and
powerfully
to
possess
the
earth
but
it
must
also
wind
up
british
imperialism
and
french
imperialism
which
do
now
so
largely
and
inaggressively
possess
it
and
moreover
this
idea
queries
the
adjective
of
belgian
portuguese
french
and
british
central
africa
alike
just
as
emphatically
as
it
queries
german
still
more
effectually
does
the
league
forbid
those
creations
of
the
futurist
imagination
the
imperialism
of
italy
and
greece
which
make
such
threatening
gestures
at
the
world
of
our
children
are
these
incompatibilities
understood
until
people
have
faced
the
clear
antagonism
that
exists
between
imperialism
and
internationalism
they
have
not
begun
to
suspect
the
real
significance
of
this
project
of
the
league
of
free
nations
they
have
not
begun
to
realize
that
peace
also
has
its
price
iv
the
labour
view
of
middle
africa
i
was
recently
privileged
to
hear
the
views
of
one
of
those
titled
and
influential
ladies
with
a
general
education
at
about
the
fifth
standard
level
plus
a
little
french
german
italian
and
music
who
do
so
much
to
make
our
england
what
it
is
at
the
present
time
upon
the
labour
idea
of
an
international
control
of
tropical
africa
she
was
loud
and
derisive
about
the
ignorance
of
labour
what
can
know
about
foreign
politics
she
said
with
gestures
to
indicate
her
conception
of
i
was
moved
to
ask
her
what
she
would
do
about
africa
leave
it
to
lord
robert
she
said
leaning
forward
impressively
it
to
the
people
who
unhappily
i
share
the
evident
opinion
of
labour
that
we
are
not
blessed
with
any
profoundly
wise
class
of
people
who
have
definite
knowledge
and
clear
intentions
about
africa
that
these
who
are
mostly
a
pretentious
bluff
and
so
in
spite
of
a
very
earnest
desire
to
take
refuge
in
my
ignorance
from
the
burthen
of
thinking
about
african
problems
i
find
myself
obliged
like
most
other
people
to
do
so
in
the
interests
of
our
country
our
children
and
the
world
we
common
persons
to
have
opinions
about
these
matters
a
in
africa
this
year
may
kill
your
son
and
mine
in
the
course
of
the
next
decade
i
know
this
is
not
a
claim
to
be
interested
in
things
african
such
as
the
promoter
of
a
tropical
railway
or
an
oil
speculator
has
still
it
is
a
claim
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
not
see
what
is
wrong
about
the
labour
proposals
or
what
alternative
exists
that
can
give
even
a
hope
of
peace
in
and
about
africa
the
gist
of
the
labour
proposal
is
an
international
control
of
africa
between
the
zambesi
and
the
sahara
this
has
been
received
with
loud
protests
by
men
whose
work
one
is
obliged
to
respect
by
sir
harry
johnston
for
example
and
sir
alfred
sharpe
and
with
something
approaching
a
shriek
of
hostility
by
cunninghame
graham
but
i
think
these
gentlemen
have
not
perhaps
given
the
labour
proposal
quite
as
much
attention
as
they
have
spent
upon
the
details
of
african
conditions
i
think
they
have
jumped
to
conclusions
at
the
mere
sound
of
the
word
international
there
have
been
some
gross
failures
in
the
past
to
set
up
international
administrations
in
africa
and
the
near
east
and
these
gentlemen
think
at
once
of
some
new
congo
administration
and
of
nondescript
police
forces
commanded
by
cosmopolitan
adventurers
see
joseph
conrad
of
civilization
they
think
of
internationalism
with
greedy
great
powers
in
the
background
outside
the
internationalized
area
intriguing
to
create
disorder
and
mischief
with
ideas
of
an
ultimate
annexation
but
i
doubt
if
such
nightmares
do
any
sort
of
justice
to
the
labour
intention
and
the
essential
thing
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
these
authorities
upon
african
questions
is
that
not
one
of
them
even
hints
at
any
other
formula
which
covers
the
broad
essentials
of
the
african
riddle
what
are
these
broad
essentials
what
are
the
ends
that
be
achieved
if
africa
is
not
to
continue
a
festering
sore
in
the
body
of
mankind
the
first
most
obvious
danger
of
africa
is
the
militarization
of
the
black
general
smuts
has
pointed
this
out
plainly
the
negro
makes
a
good
soldier
he
is
hardy
he
stands
the
sea
and
he
stands
cold
there
was
a
negro
in
the
little
party
which
reached
the
north
pole
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
peace
of
the
world
that
there
should
be
no
arming
of
the
negroes
beyond
the
minimum
necessary
for
the
policing
of
africa
but
how
is
this
to
be
watched
and
prevented
if
there
is
no
overriding
body
representing
civilization
to
say
stop
to
the
beginnings
of
any
such
militarization
i
do
not
see
how
sir
harry
johnston
sir
alfred
sharpe
and
the
other
authorities
can
object
to
at
least
an
international
african
disarmament
commission
to
watch
warn
and
protest
at
least
they
must
concede
that
but
in
practice
this
involves
something
else
a
practical
consequence
of
this
disarmament
idea
must
be
an
effective
control
of
the
importation
of
arms
into
the
tutelage
areas
of
africa
that
rat
at
the
dykes
of
civilization
that
ultimate
expression
of
political
scoundrelism
the
has
to
be
kept
under
and
stamped
out
in
africa
as
everywhere
a
disarmament
commission
that
has
no
forces
available
to
prevent
the
arms
trade
will
be
just
another
hague
convention
just
another
vague
futile
gesture
and
closely
connected
with
this
function
of
controlling
the
arms
trade
is
another
great
necessity
of
africa
under
tutelage
and
that
is
the
necessity
of
a
common
collective
agreement
not
to
demoralize
the
native
population
that
demoralization
physical
and
moral
has
already
gone
far
the
whole
negro
population
of
africa
is
now
rotten
with
diseases
introduced
by
arabs
and
europeans
during
the
last
century
and
such
african
statesmen
as
sir
harry
johnston
are
eloquent
upon
the
necessity
of
saving
the
blacks
and
the
baser
whites
from
the
effects
of
trade
gin
and
similar
alluring
articles
of
commerce
moreover
from
africa
there
is
always
something
new
in
the
way
of
tropical
diseases
and
presently
africa
if
we
let
it
continue
to
fester
as
it
festers
now
may
produce
an
epidemic
that
will
stand
exportation
to
a
temperate
climate
a
bacterium
that
may
kill
you
or
me
in
some
novel
and
disgusting
way
may
even
now
be
developing
in
some
congo
so
here
is
the
need
for
another
commission
to
look
after
the
health
of
africa
that
too
should
be
of
authority
over
all
the
area
of
tutelage
africa
it
is
no
good
stamping
out
infectious
disease
in
nyasaland
while
it
is
being
bred
in
portuguese
east
africa
and
if
there
is
a
disarmament
commission
already
controlling
the
importation
of
arms
why
should
not
that
body
also
control
at
the
same
time
the
importation
of
trade
gin
and
similar
delicacies
and
direct
quarantine
and
health
regulations
but
there
is
another
question
in
africa
upon
which
our
ignorant
labour
class
is
far
better
informed
than
our
dear
old
upper
class
which
still
squats
so
firmly
in
our
foreign
and
colonial
offices
and
that
is
the
question
of
forced
labour
we
can
not
tolerate
any
possibilities
of
the
enslavement
of
black
africa
long
ago
the
united
states
found
out
the
impossibility
of
having
slave
labour
working
in
the
same
system
with
white
to
cure
that
anomaly
cost
the
united
states
a
long
and
bloody
war
the
the
exploiter
of
the
black
becomes
a
threat
and
a
nuisance
to
any
white
democracy
he
brings
back
his
loot
to
corrupt
press
and
life
at
home
what
happened
in
america
in
the
midst
of
the
last
century
between
federals
and
confederates
must
not
happen
again
on
a
larger
scale
between
white
europe
and
middle
africa
slavery
in
africa
open
or
disguised
whether
enforced
by
the
lash
or
brought
about
by
iniquitous
strikes
at
the
home
and
freedom
of
every
european
worker
labour
knows
but
how
are
we
to
prevent
the
enslavement
and
economic
exploitation
of
the
blacks
if
we
have
no
general
watcher
of
african
conditions
we
want
a
common
law
for
africa
a
general
declaration
of
rights
of
certain
elementary
rights
and
we
want
a
common
authority
to
which
the
black
man
and
the
native
tribe
may
appeal
for
justice
what
is
the
good
of
trying
to
elevate
the
population
of
uganda
and
to
give
it
a
free
and
hopeful
life
if
some
other
population
close
at
hand
is
competing
against
the
baganda
worker
under
lash
and
tax
so
here
is
a
third
aspect
of
our
international
commission
as
a
native
protectorate
and
court
of
appeal
there
is
still
a
fourth
aspect
of
the
african
question
in
which
every
mother
son
in
europe
is
closely
interested
and
that
is
the
trade
question
africa
is
the
great
source
of
many
of
the
most
necessary
raw
materials
upon
which
our
modern
comforts
and
conveniences
depend
more
particularly
is
it
the
source
of
cheap
fat
in
the
form
of
palm
oil
one
of
the
most
powerful
levers
in
the
hands
of
the
allied
democracies
at
the
present
time
in
their
struggle
against
the
imperial
brigands
of
potsdam
is
the
complete
control
we
have
now
obtained
over
these
essential
supplies
we
can
if
we
choose
cut
off
germany
altogether
from
these
vital
economic
necessities
if
she
does
not
consent
to
abandon
militant
imperialism
for
some
more
civilized
form
of
government
we
hope
that
this
war
will
end
in
that
renunciation
and
that
germany
will
the
community
of
nations
but
whether
that
is
so
or
not
whether
germany
is
or
is
not
to
be
one
of
the
interested
parties
in
the
african
solution
the
fact
remains
that
it
is
impossible
to
contemplate
a
continuing
struggle
for
the
african
raw
material
supply
between
the
interested
powers
sooner
or
later
that
means
a
renewal
of
war
international
trade
rivalry
is
indeed
only
war
we
need
and
labour
demands
a
fair
frank
treatment
of
african
trade
and
that
can
only
be
done
by
some
overriding
regulative
power
a
commission
which
so
far
as
i
can
see
might
also
be
the
same
commission
as
that
we
have
already
hypothesized
as
being
necessary
to
control
the
customs
in
order
to
prevent
and
the
gin
trade
that
commission
might
very
conveniently
have
a
voice
in
the
administration
of
the
great
waterways
of
africa
which
often
run
through
the
possessions
of
several
powers
and
in
the
regulation
of
the
big
railway
lines
and
air
routes
that
will
speedily
follow
the
conclusion
of
peace
now
this
i
take
it
is
the
gist
of
the
labour
proposal
this
and
no
more
than
this
is
what
is
intended
by
the
international
control
of
tropical
africa
do
not
read
that
phrase
as
abrogating
existing
sovereignties
in
what
is
contemplated
is
a
delegation
of
authority
every
one
should
know
though
unhappily
the
badness
of
our
history
teaching
makes
it
doubtful
if
every
one
does
know
that
the
federal
government
of
the
united
states
of
america
did
not
begin
as
a
sovereign
government
and
has
now
only
a
very
questionable
sovereignty
each
state
was
sovereign
and
each
state
delegated
certain
powers
to
washington
that
was
the
initial
idea
of
the
union
only
later
did
the
idea
of
a
people
of
the
states
as
a
whole
emerge
in
the
same
way
i
understand
the
labour
proposal
as
meaning
that
we
should
delegate
to
an
african
commission
the
middle
african
customs
the
regulation
of
trade
railways
and
waterways
quarantine
and
health
generally
and
the
establishment
of
a
supreme
court
for
middle
african
affairs
one
or
two
minor
matters
such
as
the
preservation
of
rare
animals
might
very
well
fall
under
the
same
authority
upon
that
commission
the
interested
nations
that
is
to
say
putting
them
in
alphabetical
order
the
africander
the
briton
the
belgian
the
egyptian
the
frenchman
the
italian
the
indian
the
portuguese
might
all
be
represented
in
proportion
to
their
interest
whether
the
german
would
come
in
is
really
a
question
for
the
german
to
consider
he
can
come
in
as
a
good
european
he
can
not
come
in
as
an
imperialist
brigand
whether
too
any
other
nations
can
claim
to
have
an
interest
in
african
affairs
whether
the
commission
would
not
be
better
appointed
by
a
league
of
free
nations
than
directly
by
the
interested
governments
and
a
number
of
other
such
questions
need
not
be
considered
here
here
we
are
discussing
only
the
main
idea
of
the
labour
proposal
now
beneath
the
supervision
and
restraint
of
such
a
delegated
commission
i
do
not
see
why
the
existing
administrations
of
tutelage
africa
should
not
continue
i
do
not
believe
that
the
labour
proposal
contemplates
any
humiliating
cession
of
european
sovereignty
under
that
international
commission
the
french
flag
may
still
wave
in
senegal
and
the
british
over
the
protected
state
of
uganda
given
a
new
spirit
in
germany
i
do
not
see
why
the
german
flag
should
not
presently
be
restored
in
german
east
africa
but
over
all
standing
for
righteousness
patience
fair
play
for
the
black
and
the
common
welfare
of
mankind
would
wave
a
new
flag
the
sun
of
africa
representing
the
central
african
commission
of
the
league
of
free
nations
that
is
my
vision
of
the
labour
project
it
is
something
very
different
i
know
from
the
nightmare
of
an
international
police
of
cosmopolitan
scoundrels
in
nondescript
uniforms
hastening
to
loot
and
ravish
his
dear
uganda
and
his
beloved
nigeria
which
distresses
the
crumpled
pillow
of
sir
harry
johnston
but
if
it
is
not
the
solution
then
it
is
up
to
him
and
his
fellow
authorities
to
tell
us
what
is
the
solution
of
the
african
riddle
v
getting
the
league
idea
clear
in
relation
to
imperialism
it
is
idle
to
pretend
that
even
at
the
present
time
the
idea
of
the
league
of
free
nations
has
secure
possession
of
the
british
mind
there
is
quite
naturally
a
sustained
opposition
to
it
in
all
the
fastnesses
of
aggressive
imperialism
such
papers
as
the
and
the
remain
hostile
and
obstructive
to
the
expression
of
international
ideas
most
of
our
elder
statesmen
seem
to
have
learnt
nothing
and
forgotten
nothing
during
the
years
of
wildest
change
the
world
has
ever
known
but
in
the
general
mind
of
the
british
peoples
the
movement
of
opinion
from
a
narrow
imperialism
towards
internationalism
has
been
wide
and
swift
and
it
continues
steadily
one
can
trace
week
by
week
and
almost
day
by
day
the
americanization
of
the
british
conception
of
the
allied
war
aims
it
may
be
interesting
to
reproduce
here
three
communications
upon
this
question
made
at
different
times
by
the
present
writer
to
the
press
the
circumstances
of
their
publication
are
significant
the
first
is
in
substance
identical
with
a
letter
which
was
sent
to
the
late
in
may
and
rejected
as
being
altogether
too
revolutionary
for
nowadays
the
correspondence
in
the
has
ceased
to
be
an
impartial
expression
of
public
opinion
the
correspondence
of
the
is
now
apparently
selected
and
edited
in
accordance
with
the
views
upon
public
policy
held
by
the
acting
editor
for
the
day
more
and
more
has
that
paper
become
the
organ
of
a
sort
of
oxford
imperialism
three
or
four
years
behind
the
times
and
very
ripe
and
expert
the
letter
is
here
given
as
it
was
finally
printed
in
the
issue
of
the
for
june
under
the
heading
wanted
a
statement
of
imperial
policy
sir
the
time
seems
to
have
come
for
much
clearer
statements
of
outlook
and
intention
from
this
country
than
it
has
hitherto
been
possible
to
make
the
entry
of
america
into
the
war
and
the
banishment
of
autocracy
and
aggressive
diplomacy
from
russia
have
enormously
cleared
the
air
and
the
recent
great
speech
of
general
smuts
at
the
savoy
hotel
is
probably
only
the
first
of
a
series
of
experiments
in
statement
it
is
desirable
alike
to
clear
our
own
heads
to
unify
our
efforts
and
to
give
the
nations
of
the
world
some
assurance
and
standard
for
our
national
conduct
in
the
future
that
we
should
now
define
the
idea
of
our
empire
and
its
relation
to
the
world
outlook
much
more
clearly
than
has
ever
hitherto
been
done
never
before
in
the
history
of
mankind
has
opinion
counted
for
so
much
and
persons
and
organizations
for
so
little
as
in
this
war
never
before
has
the
need
for
clear
ideas
widely
understood
and
consistently
sustained
been
so
commandingly
vital
what
do
we
mean
by
our
empire
and
what
is
its
relation
to
that
universal
desire
of
mankind
the
permanent
rule
of
peace
and
justice
in
the
world
the
whole
world
will
be
the
better
for
a
very
plain
answer
to
that
question
is
it
not
time
for
us
british
not
merely
to
admit
to
ourselves
but
to
assure
the
world
that
our
empire
as
it
exists
is
a
provisional
thing
that
in
scarcely
any
part
of
the
world
do
we
regard
it
as
more
than
an
emergency
arrangement
as
a
necessary
association
that
must
give
place
ultimately
to
the
higher
synthesis
of
a
world
league
that
here
we
hold
as
trustees
and
there
on
account
of
strategic
considerations
that
may
presently
disappear
and
that
though
we
will
not
contemplate
the
replacement
of
our
flag
anywhere
by
the
flag
of
any
other
competing
nation
though
we
do
hope
to
hold
together
with
our
kin
and
with
those
who
increasingly
share
our
tradition
and
our
language
nevertheless
we
are
prepared
to
welcome
great
renunciations
of
our
present
ascendency
and
privileges
in
the
interests
of
mankind
as
a
whole
we
need
to
make
the
world
understand
that
we
do
not
put
our
nation
nor
our
empire
before
the
commonwealth
of
man
unless
presently
we
are
to
follow
germany
along
the
tragic
path
her
national
vanity
and
her
world
ambitions
have
made
for
her
that
is
what
we
have
to
make
clear
now
it
is
not
only
our
duty
to
mankind
it
is
also
the
sane
course
for
our
own
preservation
is
it
not
the
plain
lesson
of
this
stupendous
and
disastrous
war
that
there
is
no
way
to
secure
civilization
from
destruction
except
by
an
impartial
control
and
protection
in
the
interests
of
the
whole
human
race
a
control
representing
the
best
intelligence
of
mankind
of
these
main
causes
of
war
the
politically
undeveloped
tropics
shipping
and
international
trade
and
small
nationalities
and
all
regions
in
a
state
of
political
impotence
or
confusion
it
is
our
case
against
the
germans
that
in
all
these
three
cases
they
have
subordinated
every
consideration
of
justice
and
the
general
human
welfare
to
a
monstrous
national
egotism
that
argument
has
a
double
edge
at
present
there
is
a
vigorous
campaign
in
america
russia
the
neutral
countries
generally
to
represent
british
patriotism
as
equally
egotistic
and
our
purpose
in
this
war
as
a
mere
parallel
to
the
german
purpose
in
the
same
manner
though
perhaps
with
less
persistency
france
and
italy
are
also
caricatured
we
are
supposed
to
be
grabbing
at
mesopotamia
and
palestine
france
at
syria
italy
is
represented
as
pursuing
a
machiavellian
policy
towards
the
unfortunate
greek
republicans
with
her
eyes
on
the
greek
islands
and
greece
in
asia
is
it
not
time
that
these
base
imputations
were
repudiated
clearly
and
conclusively
by
our
alliance
and
is
it
not
time
that
we
began
to
discuss
in
much
more
frank
and
definite
terms
than
has
hitherto
been
done
the
nature
of
the
international
arrangement
that
will
be
needed
to
secure
the
safety
of
such
liberated
populations
as
those
of
palestine
of
the
arab
regions
of
the
old
turkish
empire
of
armenia
of
reunited
poland
and
the
like
i
do
not
mean
here
mere
diplomatic
discussions
and
understandings
i
mean
such
full
and
plain
statements
as
will
be
spread
through
the
whole
world
and
grasped
and
assimilated
by
ordinary
people
everywhere
statements
by
which
we
as
a
people
will
be
prepared
to
stand
or
fall
almost
as
urgent
is
the
need
for
some
definite
statement
about
africa
general
smuts
has
warned
not
only
the
empire
but
the
whole
world
of
the
gigantic
threat
to
civilization
that
lies
in
the
present
division
of
africa
between
various
keenly
competitive
european
powers
any
one
of
which
will
be
free
to
misuse
the
great
natural
resources
at
its
disposal
and
to
arm
millions
of
black
soldiers
for
aggression
a
mere
elimination
of
germany
from
africa
will
not
solve
that
difficulty
what
we
have
to
eliminate
is
not
this
nation
or
that
but
the
system
of
national
shoving
and
elbowing
the
treatment
of
africa
as
the
board
for
a
game
of
in
which
a
few
syndicates
masquerading
as
national
interests
snatch
a
profit
to
the
infinite
loss
of
all
mankind
we
want
a
lowering
of
barriers
and
a
unification
of
interests
we
want
an
international
control
of
these
disputed
regions
to
override
nationalist
exploitation
the
whole
world
wants
it
it
is
a
chastened
and
reasonable
world
we
live
in
and
the
time
for
white
reason
and
the
wide
treatment
of
these
problems
is
now
finally
the
time
is
drawing
near
when
the
egyptian
and
the
nations
of
india
will
ask
us
are
things
going
on
for
ever
here
as
they
go
on
now
or
are
we
to
look
for
the
time
when
we
too
like
the
africander
the
canadian
and
the
australian
will
be
your
confessed
and
equal
partners
would
it
not
be
wise
to
answer
that
question
in
the
affirmative
before
the
voice
in
which
it
is
asked
grows
thick
with
anger
in
egypt
for
example
we
are
either
robbers
very
like
except
for
a
certain
difference
in
touch
the
germans
in
belgium
or
we
are
honourable
trustees
it
is
our
claim
and
pride
to
be
honourable
trustees
nothing
so
becomes
a
trustee
as
a
cheerful
openness
of
disposition
great
britain
has
to
table
her
world
policy
it
is
a
thing
overdue
no
doubt
we
have
already
a
literature
of
liberal
imperialism
and
a
considerable
accumulation
of
declarations
by
this
statesman
or
that
but
what
is
needed
is
a
formulation
much
more
representative
official
and
permanent
than
that
something
that
can
be
put
beside
president
wilson
clear
rendering
of
the
american
idea
we
want
all
our
peoples
to
understand
and
we
want
all
mankind
to
understand
that
our
empire
is
not
a
net
about
the
world
in
which
the
progress
of
mankind
is
entangled
but
a
political
system
working
side
by
side
with
the
other
democracies
of
the
earth
preparing
the
way
for
and
prepared
at
last
to
sacrifice
and
merge
itself
in
the
world
confederation
of
free
and
equal
peoples
this
letter
was
presently
followed
up
by
an
article
in
the
entitled
a
reasonable
man
peace
this
article
provoked
a
considerable
controversy
in
the
imperialist
press
and
it
was
reprinted
as
a
pamphlet
by
a
free
trade
organization
which
distributed
over
copies
it
is
particularly
interesting
to
note
in
view
of
what
follows
it
that
it
was
attacked
with
great
virulence
in
the
the
little
fierce
brother
of
the
the
international
situation
at
the
present
time
is
beyond
question
the
most
wonderful
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
there
is
not
a
country
in
the
world
in
which
the
great
majority
of
sensible
people
are
not
passionately
desirous
of
peace
of
an
enduring
peace
and
the
war
goes
on
the
conditions
of
peace
can
now
be
stated
in
general
terms
that
are
as
acceptable
to
a
reasonable
man
in
berlin
as
they
are
to
a
reasonable
man
in
paris
or
london
or
petrograd
or
constantinople
there
are
to
be
no
conquests
no
domination
of
recalcitrant
populations
no
bitter
insistence
upon
vindictive
penalties
and
there
must
be
something
in
the
nature
of
a
league
of
nations
to
keep
the
peace
securely
in
future
to
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
and
maintain
international
justice
to
that
the
general
mind
of
the
world
has
come
why
then
does
the
waste
and
killing
go
on
why
is
not
the
peace
conference
sitting
now
manifestly
because
a
small
minority
of
people
in
positions
of
peculiar
advantage
in
positions
of
trust
and
authority
and
particularly
the
german
reactionaries
prevent
or
delay
its
assembling
the
answer
which
seems
to
suffice
in
all
the
allied
countries
is
that
the
german
imperial
government
that
the
german
imperial
government
alone
stands
in
the
way
that
its
tradition
is
incurably
a
tradition
of
conquest
and
aggression
that
until
german
militarism
is
overthrown
etc
few
people
in
the
allied
countries
will
dispute
that
that
is
broadly
true
but
is
it
the
whole
and
complete
truth
is
there
nothing
more
to
be
done
on
our
side
let
us
put
a
question
that
goes
to
the
very
heart
of
the
problem
why
does
the
great
mass
of
the
german
people
still
cling
to
its
incurably
belligerent
government
the
answer
to
that
question
is
not
overwhelmingly
difficult
the
german
people
sticks
to
its
militarist
imperialism
as
mazeppa
stuck
to
his
horse
because
it
is
bound
to
it
and
the
wolves
pursue
the
attentive
student
of
the
home
and
foreign
propaganda
literature
of
the
german
government
will
realize
that
the
case
made
by
german
imperialism
the
main
argument
by
which
it
sticks
to
power
is
this
that
the
allied
governments
are
also
imperialist
that
they
also
aim
at
conquest
and
aggression
that
for
germany
the
choice
is
world
empire
or
downfall
and
utter
ruin
this
is
the
argument
that
holds
the
german
people
stiffly
united
for
most
men
in
most
countries
it
would
be
a
convincing
argument
strong
enough
to
override
considerations
of
right
and
wrong
i
find
that
i
myself
am
of
this
way
of
thinking
that
whether
england
has
done
right
or
wrong
in
the
past
and
i
have
sometimes
criticized
my
country
very
bitterly
i
will
not
endure
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
at
the
foot
of
some
victorious
foreign
nation
neither
will
any
german
who
matters
very
few
people
would
respect
a
german
who
did
but
the
case
for
the
allies
is
that
this
great
argument
by
which
and
by
which
alone
the
german
imperial
government
keeps
its
grip
upon
the
german
people
at
the
present
time
and
keeps
them
facing
their
enemies
is
untrue
the
allies
declare
that
they
do
not
want
to
destroy
the
german
people
they
do
not
want
to
cripple
the
german
people
they
want
merely
to
see
certain
gaping
wounds
inflicted
by
germany
repaired
and
beyond
that
reasonable
requirement
they
want
nothing
but
to
be
assured
completely
assured
absolutely
assured
against
any
further
aggressions
on
the
part
of
germany
is
that
true
our
leaders
say
so
and
we
believe
them
we
would
not
support
them
if
we
did
not
and
if
it
is
true
have
the
statesmen
of
the
allies
made
it
as
transparently
and
convincingly
clear
to
the
german
people
as
possible
that
is
one
of
the
supreme
questions
of
the
present
time
we
can
not
too
earnestly
examine
it
because
in
the
answer
to
it
lies
the
reason
why
so
many
men
were
killed
yesterday
on
the
eastern
and
western
front
so
many
ships
sunk
so
much
property
destroyed
so
much
human
energy
wasted
for
ever
upon
mere
destruction
and
why
and
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
through
many
months
yet
perhaps
the
same
killing
and
destroying
must
still
go
on
in
many
respects
this
war
has
been
an
amazing
display
of
human
inadaptability
the
military
history
of
the
war
has
still
to
be
written
the
grim
story
of
machinery
misunderstood
improvements
resisted
antiquated
methods
persisted
in
but
the
broad
facts
are
already
before
the
public
mind
after
three
years
of
war
the
air
offensive
the
only
possible
decisive
blow
is
still
merely
talked
of
not
once
nor
twice
only
have
the
western
allies
had
victory
within
their
grasp
and
failed
to
grip
it
the
british
cavalry
generals
wasted
the
great
invention
of
the
tanks
as
a
careless
child
breaks
a
toy
at
least
equally
remarkable
is
the
dragging
inadaptability
of
european
statecraft
everywhere
the
failure
of
ministers
and
statesmen
to
rise
to
the
urgent
definite
necessities
of
the
present
time
is
glaringly
conspicuous
they
seem
to
be
incapable
even
of
thinking
how
the
war
may
be
brought
to
an
end
they
seem
incapable
of
that
plain
speaking
to
the
world
audience
which
alone
can
bring
about
a
peace
they
keep
on
with
the
tricks
and
feints
of
a
departed
age
both
on
the
side
of
the
allies
and
on
the
side
of
the
germans
the
declarations
of
public
policy
remain
childishly
vague
and
disingenuous
childishly
diplomatic
they
chaffer
like
happy
imbeciles
while
civilization
bleeds
to
death
it
was
perhaps
to
be
expected
few
if
any
men
of
over
completely
readjust
themselves
to
changed
conditions
however
novel
and
challenging
the
changes
may
be
and
nearly
all
the
leading
figures
in
these
affairs
are
elderly
men
trained
in
a
tradition
of
diplomatic
ineffectiveness
and
now
overworked
and
overstrained
to
a
pitch
of
complete
inelasticity
they
go
on
as
if
it
were
still
could
anything
be
more
palpably
shifty
and
unsatisfactory
more
senile
more
feebly
artful
than
the
recent
utterances
of
the
german
chancellor
and
on
our
own
side
let
us
examine
the
three
leading
points
about
this
peace
business
in
which
this
jaded
statecraft
is
most
apparent
let
the
reader
ask
himself
the
following
questions
does
he
know
what
the
allies
mean
to
do
with
the
problem
of
central
africa
it
is
the
clear
common
sense
of
the
african
situation
that
while
these
precious
regions
of
raw
material
remain
divided
up
between
a
number
of
competitive
european
imperialisms
each
resolutely
set
upon
the
exploitation
of
its
possessions
to
its
own
advantage
and
the
disadvantage
of
the
others
there
can
be
no
permanent
peace
in
the
world
there
can
be
permanent
peace
in
the
world
only
when
tropical
and
africa
constitute
a
field
free
to
the
commercial
enterprise
of
every
one
irrespective
of
nationality
when
this
is
no
longer
an
area
of
competition
between
nations
this
is
possible
only
under
some
supreme
international
control
it
requires
no
special
knowledge
nor
wisdom
to
see
that
a
schoolboy
can
see
it
any
one
but
a
statesman
absolutely
flaccid
with
overstrain
can
see
that
however
difficult
it
may
prove
to
work
out
in
detail
such
an
international
control
therefore
be
worked
out
the
manifest
solution
of
the
problem
of
the
german
colonies
in
africa
is
neither
to
return
them
to
her
nor
deprive
her
of
them
but
to
give
her
a
share
in
the
pooled
general
control
of
in
that
way
she
can
be
deprived
of
all
power
for
political
mischief
in
africa
without
humiliation
or
economic
injury
in
that
way
too
we
can
head
off
and
in
no
other
way
can
we
head
off
the
power
for
evil
the
power
of
developing
quarrels
inherent
in
imperialisms
other
than
german
but
has
the
reader
any
assurance
that
this
sane
solution
of
the
african
problem
has
the
support
of
the
allied
governments
at
best
he
has
only
a
vague
persuasion
and
consider
how
the
matter
looks
over
there
the
german
government
assures
the
german
people
that
the
allies
intend
to
cut
off
germany
from
the
african
supply
of
raw
material
that
would
mean
the
practical
destruction
of
german
economic
life
it
is
something
far
more
vital
to
the
mass
of
germans
than
any
question
of
belgium
or
it
is
therefore
one
of
the
ideas
most
potent
in
nerving
the
overstrained
german
people
to
continue
their
fight
why
are
we
and
why
are
the
german
people
not
given
some
definite
assurance
in
this
matter
given
reparation
in
europe
is
germany
to
be
allowed
a
fair
share
in
the
control
and
trade
of
a
pooled
and
neutralized
central
africa
sooner
or
later
we
must
come
to
some
such
arrangement
why
not
state
it
plainly
now
a
second
question
is
equally
essential
to
any
really
permanent
settlement
and
it
is
one
upon
which
these
eloquent
but
unsatisfactory
mouthpieces
of
ours
turn
their
backs
with
an
equal
resolution
and
that
is
the
fate
of
the
ottoman
empire
what
in
plain
english
are
we
up
to
there
whatever
happens
that
humpty
dumpty
can
not
be
put
back
as
it
was
before
the
war
the
idea
of
the
german
imperialist
the
idea
of
our
own
little
band
of
noisy
but
influential
imperialist
vulgarians
is
evidently
a
game
of
grab
a
perilous
cutting
up
of
these
areas
into
jostling
protectorates
and
spheres
of
influence
from
which
either
the
germans
or
the
allies
according
to
the
side
you
are
on
are
to
be
viciously
shut
out
on
such
a
basis
this
war
is
a
war
to
the
death
neither
germany
france
britain
italy
nor
russia
can
live
prosperously
if
its
trade
and
enterprise
is
shut
out
from
this
cardinally
important
area
there
is
therefore
no
alternative
if
we
are
to
have
a
satisfactory
permanent
pacification
of
the
world
but
local
in
these
regions
under
honestly
conceived
international
control
of
police
and
transit
and
trade
let
it
be
granted
that
that
will
be
a
difficult
control
to
organize
none
the
less
it
has
to
be
attempted
it
has
to
be
attempted
because
is
no
other
way
of
but
once
that
conception
has
been
clearly
formulated
a
second
great
motive
why
germany
should
continue
fighting
will
have
gone
the
third
great
issue
about
which
there
is
nothing
but
fog
and
uncertainty
is
the
war
after
the
war
the
idea
of
a
permanent
economic
alliance
to
prevent
the
economic
recuperation
of
germany
upon
that
idea
german
imperialism
in
its
frantic
effort
to
keep
its
tormented
people
fighting
naturally
puts
the
utmost
stress
the
threat
of
war
after
the
war
robs
the
reasonable
german
of
his
last
inducement
to
turn
on
his
government
and
insist
upon
peace
shut
out
from
all
trade
unable
to
buy
food
deprived
of
raw
material
peace
would
be
as
bad
for
germany
as
war
he
will
argue
naturally
enough
and
reasonably
enough
that
he
may
as
well
die
fighting
as
starve
this
is
a
far
more
vital
issue
to
him
than
the
belgian
issue
or
poland
or
our
statesmen
waste
their
breath
and
slight
our
intelligence
when
these
foreground
questions
are
thrust
in
front
of
the
really
fundamental
matters
but
as
the
mass
of
sensible
people
in
every
country
concerned
in
germany
just
as
much
as
in
france
or
great
britain
know
perfectly
well
unimpeded
trade
is
good
for
every
one
except
a
few
rich
adventurers
and
restricted
trade
destroys
limitless
wealth
and
welfare
for
mankind
to
make
a
few
private
fortunes
or
secure
an
advantage
for
some
imperialist
clique
we
want
an
end
to
this
economic
strategy
we
want
an
end
to
this
plotting
of
governmental
cliques
against
the
general
welfare
in
such
offences
germany
has
been
the
chief
of
sinners
but
which
among
the
belligerent
nations
can
throw
the
first
stone
here
again
the
way
to
the
world
peace
the
only
way
to
enduring
peace
lies
through
internationalism
through
an
international
survey
of
commercial
treaties
through
an
international
control
of
shipping
and
transport
rates
unless
the
allied
statesmen
fail
to
understand
the
implications
of
their
own
general
professions
they
mean
that
but
why
do
they
not
say
it
plainly
why
do
they
not
shout
it
so
compactly
and
loudly
that
all
germany
will
hear
and
understand
why
do
they
justify
imperialism
to
germany
why
do
they
maintain
a
threatening
ambiguity
towards
germany
on
all
these
matters
by
doing
so
they
leave
germany
no
choice
but
a
war
of
desperation
they
underline
and
endorse
the
claim
of
german
imperialism
that
this
is
a
war
for
bare
existence
they
unify
the
german
people
they
prolong
the
war
some
weeks
later
i
was
able
at
the
invitation
of
the
editor
to
carry
the
controversy
against
imperialism
into
the
which
has
hitherto
counted
as
a
strictly
imperialist
paper
the
article
that
follows
was
published
in
the
under
the
heading
are
we
sticking
to
the
point
a
discussion
of
war
aims
has
this
controversy
really
got
down
to
essentials
is
the
purpose
of
this
world
conflict
from
first
to
last
too
complicated
for
brevity
or
can
we
boil
it
down
into
a
statement
compact
enough
for
a
newspaper
article
and
if
we
can
why
is
there
all
this
voluminous
uneasy
unquenchable
disputation
about
war
aims
as
to
the
first
question
i
would
say
that
the
gist
of
the
dispute
between
the
central
powers
and
the
world
can
be
written
easily
without
undue
cramping
in
an
ordinary
handwriting
upon
a
postcard
it
is
the
second
question
that
needs
answering
and
the
reason
why
the
second
question
has
to
be
asked
and
answered
is
this
that
several
of
the
allies
and
particularly
we
british
are
not
being
perfectly
plain
and
in
our
answer
to
the
first
that
there
is
a
division
among
us
and
in
our
minds
and
that
our
division
is
making
us
ambiguous
in
our
behaviour
that
it
is
weakening
and
dividing
our
action
and
strengthening
and
consolidating
the
enemy
and
that
unless
we
can
drag
this
division
of
aim
and
spirit
into
the
light
of
day
and
it
we
are
likely
to
remain
to
the
end
of
the
war
to
split
our
strength
while
the
war
continues
and
to
come
out
of
the
settlement
at
the
end
with
nothing
nearly
worth
the
strain
and
sacrifice
it
has
cost
us
and
first
let
us
deal
with
that
postcard
and
say
what
is
the
essential
aim
of
the
war
the
aim
to
which
all
other
aims
are
subsidiary
it
is
we
have
heard
repeated
again
and
again
by
every
statesman
of
importance
in
every
allied
country
to
defeat
and
destroy
military
imperialism
to
make
the
world
safe
for
ever
against
any
such
deliberate
aggression
as
germany
prepared
for
forty
years
and
brought
to
a
climax
when
she
crossed
the
belgian
frontier
in
we
want
to
make
anything
of
that
kind
on
the
part
of
germany
or
of
any
other
power
henceforth
impossible
in
this
world
that
is
our
great
aim
whatever
other
objects
may
be
sought
in
this
war
no
responsible
statesman
dare
claim
them
as
anything
but
subsidiary
to
that
one
can
say
in
fact
this
is
our
sole
aim
our
other
aims
being
but
parts
of
it
better
that
millions
should
die
now
we
declare
than
that
hundreds
of
millions
still
unborn
should
go
on
living
generation
after
generation
under
the
black
tyranny
of
this
imperialist
threat
there
is
our
common
agreement
so
far
at
any
rate
we
are
united
the
question
i
would
put
to
the
reader
is
this
are
we
all
logically
sincerely
and
fully
carrying
out
the
plain
implications
of
this
war
aim
or
are
we
to
any
extent
muddling
about
with
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
confuse
and
disorganize
our
allies
weaken
our
internal
will
and
strengthen
the
enemy
now
the
plain
meaning
of
this
supreme
declared
war
aim
is
that
we
are
asking
germany
to
alter
her
ways
we
are
asking
germany
to
become
a
different
germany
either
germany
has
to
be
utterly
smashed
up
and
destroyed
or
else
germany
has
to
cease
to
be
an
aggressive
military
imperialism
the
former
alternative
is
dismissed
by
most
responsible
statesmen
they
declare
that
they
do
not
wish
to
destroy
the
german
people
or
the
german
nationality
or
the
civilized
life
of
germany
i
will
not
enlarge
here
upon
the
tedium
and
difficulties
such
an
undertaking
would
present
i
will
dismiss
it
as
being
not
only
impossible
but
also
as
an
insanely
wicked
project
the
second
alternative
therefore
remains
as
our
war
aim
i
do
not
see
how
the
sloppiest
reasoner
can
evade
that
as
we
do
not
want
to
kill
germany
we
must
want
to
change
germany
if
we
do
not
want
to
wipe
germany
off
the
face
of
the
earth
then
we
want
germany
to
become
the
prospective
and
friend
of
her
fellow
nations
and
if
words
have
any
meaning
at
all
that
is
saying
that
we
are
fighting
to
bring
about
a
revolution
in
germany
we
want
germany
to
become
a
democratically
controlled
state
such
as
is
the
united
states
with
open
methods
and
pacific
intentions
instead
of
remaining
a
clenched
fist
if
we
can
bring
that
about
we
have
achieved
our
war
aim
if
we
can
not
then
this
struggle
has
been
for
us
only
such
loss
and
failure
as
humanity
has
never
known
before
but
do
we
as
a
nation
stick
closely
to
this
clear
and
necessary
this
only
possible
meaning
of
our
declared
war
aim
that
great
leader
among
the
allies
that
englishman
who
more
than
any
other
single
man
speaks
for
the
whole
and
community
president
wilson
has
said
definitely
that
this
is
his
meaning
america
with
him
as
her
spokesman
is
under
no
delusion
she
is
fighting
consciously
for
a
german
revolution
as
the
essential
war
aim
we
in
europe
do
not
seem
to
be
so
lucid
i
think
myself
we
have
been
and
are
still
fatally
and
disastrously
not
lucid
it
is
high
time
and
over
that
we
cleared
our
minds
and
got
down
to
the
essentials
of
the
war
we
have
muddled
about
in
blood
and
dirt
and
secondary
issues
long
enough
we
in
britain
are
not
i
would
point
out
because
we
are
no
good
end
is
served
by
trying
to
ignore
in
the
fancied
interests
of
unity
a
division
of
spirit
and
intention
that
trips
us
up
at
every
step
we
are
we
declare
fighting
for
a
complete
change
in
international
methods
and
we
are
bound
to
stick
to
the
logical
consequences
of
that
we
have
placed
ourselves
on
the
side
of
democratic
revolution
against
autocratic
monarchy
and
we
can
not
afford
to
go
on
with
that
choice
we
can
not
in
these
days
of
black
or
white
play
the
part
of
lukewarm
friends
to
freedom
i
will
not
remind
the
reader
here
of
the
horrible
vacillations
and
inconsistencies
of
policy
in
greece
that
have
prolonged
the
war
and
cost
us
wealth
and
lives
beyond
measure
but
president
wilson
himself
has
reminded
us
pungently
enough
and
sufficiently
enough
of
the
follies
and
disingenuousness
of
our
early
treatment
of
the
russian
revolution
what
i
want
to
point
out
here
is
the
supreme
importance
of
a
clear
lead
in
this
matter
in
order
that
we
should
state
our
war
aims
effectively
in
every
war
there
must
be
two
sets
of
war
aims
kept
in
mind
we
ought
to
know
what
we
mean
to
do
in
the
event
of
victory
so
complete
that
we
can
dictate
what
terms
we
choose
and
we
ought
to
know
what
in
the
event
of
a
not
altogether
conclusive
tussle
are
the
minimum
terms
that
we
should
consider
justified
us
in
a
discontinuance
of
the
tussle
now
unless
our
leading
statesmen
are
humbugs
and
unless
we
are
prepared
to
quarrel
with
america
in
the
interests
of
the
monarchist
institutions
of
europe
we
should
in
the
event
of
an
overwhelming
victory
destroy
both
the
hohenzollern
and
hapsburg
imperialisms
and
that
means
if
it
means
anything
at
all
and
is
not
mere
lying
rhetoric
that
we
should
insist
upon
germany
becoming
free
and
democratic
that
is
to
say
in
effect
if
not
in
form
republican
and
upon
a
series
of
national
republics
polish
hungarian
bulgarian
and
the
like
in
eastern
europe
grouped
together
if
possible
into
congenial
groups
crowned
republics
it
might
be
in
some
cases
in
the
case
of
the
serb
for
example
but
in
no
case
too
much
crowned
that
we
should
join
with
this
renascent
germany
and
with
these
thus
liberalized
powers
and
with
our
allies
and
with
the
neutrals
in
one
great
league
of
free
nations
trading
freely
with
one
another
guaranteeing
each
other
freedom
and
maintaining
a
peace
and
disarmament
and
a
new
reign
of
law
for
mankind
if
that
is
not
what
we
are
out
for
then
i
do
not
understand
what
we
are
out
for
there
is
dishonesty
and
trickery
and
diplomacy
and
foolery
in
the
struggle
and
i
am
no
longer
for
such
a
war
if
after
a
complete
victory
we
are
to
bolster
up
the
hohenzollerns
hapsburgs
and
their
relations
set
up
a
constellation
of
more
cheating
little
subordinate
kings
and
reinstate
that
system
of
diplomacies
and
secret
treaties
and
secret
understandings
that
endless
drama
of
international
threatening
and
plotting
that
arming
that
has
led
us
after
a
hundred
years
of
waste
and
muddle
to
the
supreme
tragedy
of
this
war
then
the
world
is
not
good
enough
for
me
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
close
my
eyes
upon
it
i
am
not
alone
in
these
sentiments
i
believe
that
in
writing
thus
i
am
writing
the
opinion
of
the
great
mass
of
reasonable
british
french
italian
russian
and
american
men
i
believe
too
that
this
is
the
desire
also
of
great
numbers
of
germans
and
that
they
would
if
they
could
believe
us
gladly
set
aside
their
present
rulers
to
achieve
this
plain
common
good
for
mankind
but
the
reader
will
say
what
evidence
is
there
of
any
republican
feeling
in
germany
that
is
always
the
objection
made
to
any
reasonable
discussion
of
the
war
and
as
most
of
us
are
denied
access
to
german
papers
it
is
difficult
to
produce
quotations
and
even
when
one
does
there
are
plenty
of
fools
to
suggest
and
believe
that
the
entire
german
press
is
an
elaborate
camouflage
yet
in
the
german
press
there
is
far
more
criticism
of
militant
imperialism
than
those
who
have
no
access
to
it
can
imagine
there
is
far
franker
criticism
of
militarism
in
germany
than
there
is
of
reactionary
toryism
in
this
country
and
it
is
more
free
to
speak
its
mind
that
however
is
a
question
by
the
way
it
is
not
the
main
thing
that
i
have
to
say
here
what
i
have
to
say
here
is
that
in
great
britain
i
will
not
discuss
the
affairs
of
any
of
our
allies
there
are
groups
and
classes
of
people
not
numerous
not
representative
but
placed
in
high
and
influential
positions
and
capable
of
free
and
public
utterance
who
are
secretly
and
bitterly
hostile
to
this
great
war
aim
which
inspires
all
the
allied
peoples
these
people
are
permitted
to
deny
our
peculiar
censorship
does
not
hamper
them
loudly
and
publicly
that
we
are
fighting
for
democracy
and
world
freedom
tosh
they
say
to
our
dead
in
the
trenches
you
died
for
a
mistake
they
jeer
at
this
idea
of
a
league
of
nations
making
an
end
to
war
an
idea
that
has
inspired
countless
brave
lads
to
face
death
and
such
pains
and
hardships
as
outdo
even
death
itself
they
perplex
and
irritate
our
allies
by
propounding
schemes
for
some
precious
economic
league
of
the
british
empire
that
is
to
treat
all
foreigners
with
a
common
base
selfishness
and
stupid
hatred
and
they
intrigue
with
the
most
reactionary
forces
in
russia
these
british
reactionaries
openly
and
with
perfect
impunity
represent
our
war
as
a
thing
as
mean
and
shameful
as
germany
attack
on
belgium
and
they
do
it
because
generosity
and
justice
in
the
world
is
as
terrible
to
them
as
dawn
is
to
the
creatures
of
the
night
our
tories
blundered
into
this
great
war
not
seeing
whither
it
would
take
them
in
particular
it
is
manifest
now
by
a
hundred
signs
that
they
dread
the
fall
of
monarchy
in
germany
and
austria
far
rather
would
they
make
the
most
abject
surrenders
to
the
kaiser
than
deal
with
a
renascent
republican
germany
the
recent
letter
of
lord
lansdowne
urging
a
peace
with
german
imperialism
was
but
a
feeler
from
the
pacifist
side
of
this
most
and
unhappily
most
influential
section
of
our
public
life
lord
lansdowne
letter
was
the
letter
of
a
peer
who
fears
revolution
more
than
national
dishonour
but
it
is
the
truculent
wing
of
this
same
movement
that
is
far
more
active
while
our
sons
suffer
and
die
for
their
comforts
and
conceit
these
people
scheme
to
prevent
any
communication
between
the
republican
and
socialist
classes
in
germany
and
the
allied
population
at
any
cost
this
class
of
pampered
and
privileged
traitors
intend
to
have
peace
while
the
kaiser
is
still
on
his
throne
if
not
they
face
a
new
world
in
which
their
part
will
be
small
indeed
and
with
the
utmost
ingenuity
they
maintain
a
dangerous
vagueness
about
the
allied
peace
terms
the
sole
object
of
preventing
a
revolutionary
movement
in
let
me
put
it
to
the
reader
exactly
why
our
failure
to
say
plainly
and
exactly
and
conclusively
what
we
mean
to
do
about
a
score
of
points
and
particularly
about
german
economic
life
after
the
war
paralyses
the
penitents
and
friends
and
helpers
that
we
could
now
find
in
germany
let
me
ask
the
reader
to
suppose
himself
a
german
in
germany
at
the
present
time
of
course
if
he
was
he
is
sure
that
he
would
hate
the
kaiser
as
the
source
of
this
atrocious
war
he
would
be
bitterly
ashamed
of
the
belgian
iniquity
of
the
submarine
murders
and
a
score
of
such
stains
upon
his
national
honour
and
he
would
want
to
alter
his
national
system
and
make
peace
hundreds
of
thousands
of
germans
are
in
that
mood
now
but
as
most
of
us
have
had
to
learn
a
man
may
be
bitterly
ashamed
of
this
or
that
incident
in
his
country
history
what
englishman
for
instance
can
be
proud
of
glencoe
he
may
disbelieve
in
half
its
institutions
and
still
love
his
country
far
too
much
to
suffer
the
thought
of
its
destruction
i
prefer
to
see
my
country
right
but
if
it
comes
to
the
pinch
and
my
country
sins
i
will
fight
to
save
her
from
the
destruction
her
sins
may
have
brought
upon
her
that
is
the
natural
way
of
a
man
but
suppose
a
german
wished
to
try
to
start
a
revolutionary
movement
in
germany
at
the
present
time
have
we
given
him
any
reason
at
all
for
supposing
that
a
germany
liberated
and
democratized
but
of
course
divided
and
weakened
as
she
would
be
bound
to
be
in
the
process
would
get
better
terms
from
the
allies
than
a
germany
still
facing
them
militant
imperialist
and
wicked
he
would
have
no
reason
for
believing
anything
of
the
sort
if
we
allies
are
honest
then
if
a
revolution
started
in
germany
we
should
if
anything
lower
the
price
of
peace
to
germany
but
these
people
who
pretend
to
lead
us
will
state
nothing
of
the
sort
for
them
a
revolution
in
germany
would
be
the
signal
for
putting
up
the
price
of
peace
at
any
risk
they
are
resolved
that
that
german
revolution
shall
not
happen
your
sane
good
german
let
me
assert
is
up
against
that
as
hard
as
if
he
was
a
wicked
one
and
so
poor
devil
he
has
to
put
his
revolutionary
ideas
away
they
are
hopeless
ideas
for
him
because
of
the
power
of
the
british
reactionary
they
are
hopeless
because
of
the
line
we
as
a
nation
take
in
this
matter
and
he
has
to
go
on
fighting
for
his
masters
a
plain
statement
of
our
war
aims
that
did
no
more
than
set
out
honestly
and
convincingly
the
terms
the
allies
would
make
with
a
democratic
republican
germany
republican
i
say
because
where
a
scrap
of
hohenzollern
is
left
there
will
be
a
fresh
militarism
would
absolutely
revolutionize
the
internal
psychology
of
germany
we
should
no
longer
face
a
solid
people
we
should
have
replaced
the
false
issue
of
germany
and
britain
fighting
for
the
hegemony
of
europe
the
lie
upon
which
the
german
government
has
always
traded
and
in
which
our
extreme
tory
press
has
always
supported
the
german
government
by
the
true
issue
which
is
freedom
versus
imperialism
the
league
of
nations
versus
that
net
of
diplomatic
roguery
and
of
aristocratic
plutocratic
and
autocratic
greed
and
conceit
which
dragged
us
all
into
this
vast
welter
of
bloodshed
and
loss
vi
the
war
aims
of
the
western
allies
here
quite
compactly
is
the
plain
statement
of
the
essential
cause
and
process
of
the
war
to
which
i
would
like
to
see
the
allied
foreign
offices
subscribe
and
which
i
would
like
to
have
placed
plainly
before
the
german
mind
it
embodies
much
that
has
been
learnt
and
thought
out
since
this
war
began
and
i
think
it
is
much
truer
and
more
fundamental
than
that
mere
raging
against
german
militarism
upon
which
our
politicians
and
press
still
so
largely
subsist
the
enormous
development
of
war
methods
and
war
material
within
the
last
fifty
years
has
made
war
so
horrible
and
destructive
that
it
is
impossible
to
contemplate
a
future
for
mankind
from
which
it
has
not
been
eliminated
the
increased
facilities
of
railway
steamship
automobile
travel
and
air
navigation
have
brought
mankind
so
close
together
that
ordinary
human
life
is
no
longer
safe
anywhere
in
the
boundaries
of
the
little
states
in
which
it
was
once
secure
in
some
fashion
it
is
now
necessary
to
achieve
sufficient
human
unity
to
establish
a
world
peace
and
save
the
future
of
mankind
in
one
or
other
of
two
ways
only
is
that
unification
possible
either
men
may
set
up
a
common
league
to
keep
the
peace
of
the
earth
or
one
state
must
ultimately
become
so
great
and
powerful
as
to
repeat
for
all
the
world
what
rome
did
for
europe
two
thousand
years
ago
either
we
must
have
human
unity
by
a
league
of
existing
states
or
by
an
imperial
conquest
the
former
is
now
the
declared
aim
of
our
country
and
its
allies
the
latter
is
manifestly
the
ambition
of
the
present
rulers
of
germany
whatever
the
complications
may
have
been
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
war
due
to
treaties
that
are
now
dead
letters
and
agreements
that
are
extinct
the
essential
issue
now
before
every
man
in
the
world
is
this
is
the
unity
of
mankind
to
be
the
unity
of
a
common
freedom
in
which
every
race
and
nationality
may
participate
with
complete
playing
its
part
according
to
its
character
in
one
great
world
community
or
is
it
to
be
reached
and
it
can
only
be
so
reached
through
many
generations
of
bloodshed
and
struggle
still
even
if
it
can
be
ever
reached
in
this
way
at
all
through
conquest
and
a
german
hegemony
while
the
rulers
of
germany
are
more
openly
aggressive
and
imperialist
than
they
were
in
august
the
allies
arrayed
against
them
have
made
great
progress
in
clearing
up
and
realizing
the
instincts
and
ideals
which
brought
them
originally
into
the
struggle
the
german
government
offers
the
world
a
warring
future
in
which
germany
alone
is
to
be
secure
and
powerful
and
proud
will
not
endure
the
allies
offer
the
world
more
and
more
definitely
the
scheme
of
an
organized
league
of
free
nations
a
rule
of
law
and
justice
about
the
earth
to
fight
for
that
and
for
no
other
conceivable
end
the
united
states
of
america
with
the
full
sympathy
and
of
every
state
in
the
western
hemisphere
has
entered
the
war
the
british
empire
in
the
midst
of
the
stress
of
the
great
war
has
set
up
in
dublin
a
convention
of
irishmen
of
all
opinions
with
the
fullest
powers
of
deciding
upon
the
future
of
their
country
if
ireland
were
not
divided
against
herself
she
could
be
free
and
equal
with
england
it
is
the
open
intention
of
great
britain
to
develop
representative
government
where
it
has
not
hitherto
existed
in
india
and
egypt
to
go
on
steadfastly
increasing
the
share
of
the
natives
of
these
countries
in
the
government
of
their
own
lands
until
they
too
become
free
and
equal
members
of
the

neither
france
nor
italy
nor
britain
nor
america
has
ever
tampered
with
the
shipping
of
other
countries
except
in
time
of
war
and
the

of
the

has
been
impartially

the

against
the
day
when
the

is
it
to
be
union
by
conquest
or
is
it
to
be
union
by
league
for
any
sort
of
man
except
the
german
the
question
is
will
you
be
a
free
citizen
or
will
you
be
an
underling
to
the
german
imperialism
for
the
german
now
the
question
is
a
far
graver
and
more
tragic
one
for
him
it
is
this
you
belong
to
a
people
not
now
increasing
very
rapidly
a
numerous
people
but
not
so
numerous
as
some
of
the
great
peoples
of
the
world
a
people
very
highly
trained
very
well
drilled
and
well
armed
perhaps
as
well
trained
and
drilled
and
equipped
as
ever
it
will
be
the
collapse
of
russian
imperialism
has
made
you
safe
if
now
you
can
get
peace
and
you
get
a
peace
now
that
will
neither
destroy
you
nor
humiliate
you
nor
open
up
the
prospect
of
fresh
wars
the
allies
offer
you
such
a
peace
to
accept
it
we
must
warn
you
plainly
means
refusing
to
go
on
with
the
manifest
intentions
of
your
present
rulers
which
are
to
launch
you
and
your
children
and
your
children
children
upon
a
career
of
struggle
for
war
predominance
which
may
no
doubt
inflict
untold
deprivations
and
miseries
upon
the
rest
of
mankind
but
whose
end
in
the
long
run
for
germany
and
things
german
can
be
only
judgment
and
death
in
such
terms
as
these
the
oceanic
allies
could
now
state
their
and
carry
the
world
straightway
into
a
new
phase
of
human
history
they
could
but
they
do
not
for
alas
not
one
of
them
is
free
from
the
entanglements
of
past
things
when
we
look
for
the
wisdom
of
statesmen
we
find
the
cunning
of
politicians
when
open

plain
reason
might

conspire
vii
the
future
of
monarchy
from
the
very
outset
of
this
war
it
was
manifest
to
the
observer
that
only
the
complete
victory
of
german
imperialism
could
save
the
dynastic
system
in
europe
from
the
fate
that
it
had
challenged
that
curious
system
had
been
the
natural
and
unplanned
development
of
the
political
complications
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
two
systems
of
monarchies
the
bourbon
system
and
the
german
then
ruled
europe
between
them
with
the
latter
was
associated
the
tradition
of
the
european
unity
under
the
roman
empire
all
the
germanic
monarchs
had
an
itch
to
be
called
caesar
the
kaiser
of
the
empire
and
the
czar
had
so
to
speak
the
prior
claim
to
the
title
the
prussian
king
set
up
as
a
caesar
in
queen
victoria
became
the
caesar
of
india
under
the
auspices
of
lord
beaconsfield
and
last
and
least
that
most
detestable
of
all
coburgers
ferdinand
of
bulgaria
gave
kaiserism
a
touch
of
quaint
absurdity
by
setting
up
as
czar
of
bulgaria
the
weakening
of
the
bourbon
system
by
the
french
revolution
and
the
napoleonic
adventure
cleared
the
way
for
the
complete
ascendancy
of
the
germanic
monarchies
in
spite
of
the
breaking
away
of
the
united
states
from
that
system
after
a
constellation
of
teutonic
monarchs
of
which
the
german
emperor
the
german
queen
victoria
the
german
czar
were
the
greatest
stars
formed
a
caste
apart
intermarried
only
among
themselves
dominated
the
world
and
was
regarded
with
a
mystical
awe
by
the
ignorant
and
foolish
in
most
european
countries
the
marriages
the
funerals
the
coronations
the
obstetrics
of
this
amazing
breed
of
idols
were
matters
of
almost
universal
worship
the
czar
and
queen
victoria
professed
also
to
be
the
heads
of
religion
upon
earth
the
diplomacies
of
the
more
firmly
rooted
monarchies
steered
all
the
great
liberating
movements
of
the
nineteenth
century
into
monarchical
channels
italy
was
made
a
monarchy
greece
the
motherland
of
republics
was
handed
over
to
a
needy
scion
of
the
danish
royal
family
the
sturdy
peasants
of
bulgaria
suffered
from
a
kindred
imposition
even
norway
was
saddled
with
as
much
of
a
king
as
it
would
stand
as
a
condition
of
its
independence
at
the
dawn
of
the
twentieth
century
republican
freedom
seemed
a
remote
dream
beyond
the
confines
of
switzerland
and
france
and
it
had
no
very
secure
air
in
france
reactionary
scheming
has
been
an
intermittent
fever
in
the
french
republic
for
six
and
forty
years
the
french
foreign
office
is
still
undemocratic
in
tradition
and
temper
but
for
the
restless
disloyalty
of
the
hohenzollerns
this
german
kingly
caste
might
be
dominating
the
world
to
this
day
of
course
the
stability
of
this
teutonic
dynastic
system
in
europe
which
will
presently
seem
to
the
student
of
history
so
curious
a
upon
the
way
to
human
unity
rested
very
largely
upon
the
maintenance
of
peace
it
was
the
failure
to
understand
this
on
the
part
of
the
german
and
bulgarian
rulers
in
particular
that
has
now
brought
all
monarchy
to
the
question
the
implicit
theory
that
supported
the
intermarrying
german
royal
families
in
europe
was
that
their
and
their
aloofness
from
their
subjects
was
a
mitigation
of
national
and
racial
animosities
in
the
days
when
queen
victoria
was
the
grandmother
of
europe
this
was
a
plausible
argument
king
czar
and
emperor
or
emperor
and
emperor
would
meet
and
it
was
understood
that
these
meetings
were
the
lubrication
of
european
affairs
the
monarchs
married
largely
conspicuously
and
very
expensively
for
our
good
royal
funerals
marriages
christenings
coronations
and
jubilees
interrupted
traffic
and
stimulated
trade
everywhere
they
seemed
to
give
a
for
mankind
it
is
the
emperor
william
and
the
czar
ferdinand
who
have
betrayed
not
only
humanity
but
their
own
strange
caste
by
shattering
all
these
pleasant
illusions
the
wisdom
of
kant
is
justified
and
we
know
now
that
kings
cause
wars
it
needed
the
shock
of
the
great
war
to
bring
home
the
wisdom
of
that
old
scotchman
of
königsberg
to
the
mind
of
the
ordinary
man
moreover
in
support
of
the
dynastic
system
was
the
fact
that
it
did
exist
as
the
system
in
possession
and
all
prosperous
and
intelligent
people
are
chary
of
disturbing
existing
things
life
is
full
of
vestigial
structures
and
it
is
a
long
way
to
logical
perfection
let
us
keep
on
they
would
argue
with
what
we
have
and
another
idea
which
rightly
or
wrongly
made
men
patient
with
the
emperors
and
kings
was
an
exaggerated
idea
of
the
insecurity
of
republican
institutions
you
can
still
hear
very
old
dull
men
say
gravely
that
kings
are
better
than
pronunciamentos
there
was
an
article
upon
greece
to
this
effect
quite
recently
in
that
uncertain
paper
new
then
a
kind
of
illustrative
gesture
would
be
made
to
the
south
american
republics
although
the
internal
disturbances
of
the
south
american
republics
have
diminished
to
very
small
dimensions
in
the
last
three
decades
and
although
pronunciamentos
rarely
disturb
the
traffic
in
switzerland
the
united
states
or
france
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
influence
of
the
germanic
monarchy
up
to
the
death
of
queen
victoria
upon
british
thought
was
in
the
direction
of
estrangement
from
the
two
great
modern
republics
and
in
the
direction
of
assistance
and
propitiation
to
germany
we
surrendered
heligoland
we
made
great
concessions
to
german
colonial
ambitions
we
allowed
ourselves
to
be
jockeyed
into
a
phase
of
dangerous
hostility
to
france
a
practice
of
sneering
at
things
american
has
died
only
very
recently
out
of
english
journalism
and
literature
as
any
one
who
cares
to
consult
the
bound
magazines
of
the
and
may
soon
see
for
himself
it
is
well
too
in
these
days
not
to
forget
colonel
marchand
if
only
to
remember
that
such
a
clash
must
never
recur
but
in
justice
to
our
monarchy
we
must
remember
that
after
the
death
of
queen
victoria
the
spirit
if
not
the
forms
of
british
kingship
was
greatly
modified
by
the
exceptional
character
and
ability
of
king
edward
vii
he
was
curiously
in
spirit
he
had
essentially
democratic
instincts
in
a
few
precious
years
he
restored
good
will
between
france
and
great
britain
it
is
no
slight
upon
his
successor
to
doubt
whether
any
one
could
have
handled
the
present
opportunities
and
risks
of
monarchy
in
great
britain
as
edward
could
have
handled
them
because
no
doubt
if
monarchy
is
to
survive
in
the
british
empire
it
must
speedily
undergo
the
profoundest
modification
the
old
state
of
affairs
can
not
continue
the
european
dynastic
system
based
upon
the
intermarriage
of
a
group
of
mainly
german
royal
families
is
dead
it
is
freshly
dead
but
it
is
as
dead
as
the
rule
of
the
incas
it
is
idle
to
close
our
eyes
to
this
fact
the
revolution
in
russia
the
setting
up
of
a
republic
in
china
demonstrating
the
ripeness
of
the
east
for
free
institutions
the
entry
of
the
american
republics
into
world
politics
these
things
slam
the
door
on
any
idea
of
working
back
to
the
old
system
people
calls
to
people
no
peace
with
the
hohenzollerns
is
a
cry
that
carries
with
it
the
final
repudiation
of
emperors
and
kings
the
man
in
the
street
will
assure
you
he
wants
no
diplomatic
peace
beyond
the
unstable
shapes
of
the
present
the
political
forms
of
the
future
rise
now
so
clearly
that
they
are
the
common
talk
of
men
kant
lucid
thought
told
us
long
ago
that
the
peace
of
the
world
demanded
a
world
union
of
republics
that
is
a
commonplace
remark
now
in
every
civilized
community
the
stars
in
their
courses
the
logic
of
circumstances
the
everyday
needs
and
everyday
intelligence
of
men
all
these
things
march
irresistibly
towards
a
permanent
world
peace
based
on
democratic
republicanism
the
question
of
the
future
of
monarchy
is
not
whether
it
will
be
able
to
resist
and
overcome
that
trend
it
has
as
little
chance
of
doing
that
as
the
lama
of
thibet
has
of
becoming
emperor
of
the
earth
it
is
whether
it
will
resist
openly
become
the
centre
and
symbol
of
a
reactionary
resistance
and
have
to
be
abolished
and
swept
away
altogether
everywhere
as
the
romanoffs
have
already
been
swept
away
in
russia
or
whether
it
will
be
able
in
this
country
and
that
to
adapt
itself
to
the
necessities
of
the
great
age
that
dawns
upon
mankind
to
take
a
generous
and
helpful
attitude
towards
its
own
modification
and
so
survive
for
a
time
at
any
rate
in
that
larger
air
it
is
the
fashion
for
the
apologists
of
monarchy
in
the
british
empire
to
speak
of
the
british
system
as
a
crowned
republic
that
is
an
attractive
phrase
to
people
of
republican
sentiments
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
the
british
empire
may
be
able
to
make
that
phrase
a
reality
and
that
the
royal
line
may
continue
a
line
of
hereditary
presidents
with
some
of
the
ancient
trappings
and
something
of
the
picturesque
prestige
that
as
the
oldest
monarchy
in
europe
it
has
two
kings
in
europe
have
already
gone
far
towards
realizing
this
conception
of
a
life
president
both
the
king
of
italy
and
the
king
of
norway
live
as
simply
as
if
they
were
in
the
white
house
and
are
far
more
accessible
along
that
line
the
british
monarchy
must
go
if
it
is
not
to
go
altogether
will
it
go
along
those
lines
there
are
many
reasons
for
hoping
that
it
will
do
so
the
has
styled
the
crown
the
golden
link
of
the
empire
australians
and
canadians
it
was
argued
had
little
love
for
the
motherland
but
the
greatest
devotion
to
the
sovereign
and
still
truer
was
this
of
indians
egyptians
and
the
like
it
might
be
easy
to
press
this
theory
of
devotion
too
far
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
british
crown
does
at
present
stand
as
a
symbol
of
unity
over
diversity
such
as
no
other
crown
unless
it
be
that
of
can
be
said
to
do
the
british
crown
is
not
like
other
crowns
it
may
conceivably
take
a
line
of
its
own
and
emerge
possibly
a
little
more
like
a
hat
and
a
little
less
like
a
crown
from
trials
that
may
destroy
every
other
monarchial
system
in
the
world
now
many
things
are
going
on
behind
the
scenes
many
little
indications
peep
out
upon
the
speculative
watcher
and
vanish
again
but
there
is
very
little
that
is
definite
to
go
upon
at
the
present
time
to
determine
how
far
the
monarchy
will
rise
to
the
needs
of
this
great
occasion
certain
acts
and
changes
the
initiative
to
which
would
come
most
gracefully
from
royalty
itself
could
be
done
at
this
present
time
they
may
be
done
quite
soon
upon
the
doing
of
them
wait
great
masses
of
public
opinion
the
first
of
these
things
is
for
the
british
monarchy
to
sever
itself
definitely
from
the
german
dynastic
system
with
which
it
is
so
fatally
entangled
by
marriage
and
descent
and
to
make
its
intention
of
becoming
henceforth
more
and
more
british
in
blood
as
well
as
spirit
unmistakably
plain
this
idea
has
been
put
forth
quite
prominently
in
the
the
king
has
been
asked
to
give
his
countenance
to
the
sweeping
away
of
all
those
restrictions
first
set
up
by
george
the
third
upon
the
marriage
of
the
royal
princes
with
british
french
and
american
subjects
the
british
empire
is
very
near
the
limit
of
its
endurance
of
a
kingly
caste
of
germans
the
choice
of
british
royalty
between
its
peoples
and
its
cousins
can
not
be
indefinitely
delayed
were
it
made
now
publicly
and
boldly
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
decision
would
mean
a
renascence
of
monarchy
a
considerable
outbreak
of
royalist
enthusiasm
in
the
empire
there
are
times
when
a
king
or
queen
must
need
be
dramatic
and
must
a
little
anticipate
occasions
it
is
not
seemly
to
make
concessions
perforce
kings
may
not
make
obviously
unwilling
surrenders
it
is
the
indecisive
kings
who
lose
their
crowns
no
doubt
the
anglicization
of
the
royal
family
by
national
marriages
would
gradually
merge
that
family
into
the
general
body
of
the
british
peerage
its
consequent
loss
of
distinction
might
be
accompanied
by
an
associated
fading
out
of
function
until
the
king
became
at
last
hardly
more
functional
than
was
the
late
duke
of
norfolk
as
premier
peer
possibly
that
is
the
most
desirable
course
from
many
points
of
view
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
abandonment
of
marriages
within
the
royal
caste
and
a
bold
attempt
to
introduce
a
strain
of
british
blood
in
the
royal
family
does
not
in
itself
fulfil
all
that
is
needed
if
the
british
king
is
indeed
to
become
the
crowned
president
of
his
people
and
the
nominal
and
accepted
leader
of
the
movement
towards
republican
institutions
a
thing
that
is
productive
of
an
enormous
amount
of
republican
talk
in
great
britain
is
the
suspicion
i
believe
an
suspicion
that
there
are
influences
at
work
at
court
antagonistic
to
republican
institutions
in
friendly
states
and
that
there
is
a
disposition
even
to
sacrifice
the
interests
of
the
liberal
allies
to
dynastic
sympathies
these
things
are
not
to
be
believed
but
it
would
be
a
feat
of
vast
impressiveness
if
there
were
something
like
a
royal
and
public
repudiation
of
the
weaknesses
of
cousinship
the
behaviour
of
the
allies
towards
that
great
balkan
statesman
venizelos
the
sacrificing
of
the
friendly
greek
republicans
in
favour
of
the
manifestly
treacherous
king
of
greece
has
produced
the
deepest
shame
and
disgust
in
many
quarters
that
are
altogether
friendly
that
are
even
warmly
loyal
to
the
british
monarchy
and
in
a
phase
of
tottering
thrones
it
is
very
undesirable
that
the
british
habit
of
asylum
should
be
abused
we
have
already
in
england
the
dethroned
monarch
of
a
friendly
republic
he
is
no
doubt
duly
looked
after
in
the
future
there
may
be
a
shaking
of
the
autumnal
boughs
and
a
shower
of
emperors
and
kings
we
do
not
want
great
britain
to
become
a
hotbed
of
reactionary
plotting
and
the
of
restoration
raids
into
the
territories
of
emancipated
peoples
this
is
particularly
desirable
if
presently
after
the
kaiser
death
which
by
all
the
statistics
of
hohenzollern
mortality
can
not
be
delayed
now
for
many
years
the
present
crown
prince
goes
we
do
not
want
any
german
sweden
is
always
open
to
them
and
friendly
and
to
sweden
they
ought
to
go
and
particularly
do
british
people
dread
an
irruption
of
hohenzollerns
or
coburgers
almost
as
undesirable
would
be
the
arrival
of
the
czar
and
czarina
it
is
supremely
important
that
no
wind
of
suspicion
should
blow
between
us
and
the
freedom
of
russia
after
the
war
even
more
than
during
the
war
will
the
enemy
be
anxious
to
sow
discord
between
the
great
and
democracies
quite
apart
from
the
scandal
of
their
inelegant
domesticities
the
establishment
of
the
czar
and
czarina
in
england
with
frequent
and
easy
access
to
our
royal
family
may
be
extraordinarily
unfortunate
for
the
british
monarchy
i
will
confess
a
certain
sympathy
for
the
czar
myself
he
is
not
an
evil
figure
he
is
not
a
strong
figure
but
he
has
that
sort
of
weakness
that
failure
in
decision
which
trails
revolution
in
its
wake
he
has
ended
one
dynasty
already
the
british
royal
family
owes
it
to
itself
that
he
bring
not
the
infection
of
his
misfortunes
to
windsor
the
security
of
the
british
monarchy
lies
in
such
a
courageous
severance
of
its
destinies
from
the
teutonic
dynastic
system
will
it
make
that
severance
there
i
share
an
almost
universal
ignorance
the
loyalty
of
the
british
is
not
to
what
kings
are
too
prone
to
call
my
person
not
to
a
chosen
and
admired
family
but
to
a
renascent
mankind
we
have
fought
in
this
war
for
belgium
for
france
for
general
freedom
for
civilization
and
the
whole
future
of
mankind
far
more
than
for
ourselves
we
have
not
fought
for
a
king
we
are
discovering
in
that
spirit
of
human
unity
that
lies
below
the
idea
of
a
league
of
free
nations
the
real
invisible
king
of
our
heart
and
race
but
we
will
very
gladly
go
on
with
our
task
under
a
nominal
king
unless
he
hampers
us
in
the
task
that
grows
ever
more
plainly
before
us
that
i
think
is
a
fair
statement
of
british
public
opinion
on
this
question
but
every
day
when
i
am
in
london
i
walk
past
buckingham
palace
to
lunch
at
my
club
and
i
look
at
that
not
very
expressive
façade
and
wonder
and
we
all
wonder
what
thoughts
are
going
on
behind
it
and
what
acts
are
being
conceived
there
out
of
it
there
might
yet
come
some
gesture
of
acceptance
magnificent
enough
to
set
beside
president
magnificent
declaration
of
war
these
are
things
in
the
scales
of
fate
i
will
not
pretend
to
be
able
to
guess
even
which
way
the
scales
will
swing
viii
the
plain
necessity
for
a
league
great
as
the
sacrifices
of
prejudice
and
preconception
which
any
effective
realization
of
this
idea
of
a
league
of
free
nations
will
demand
difficult
as
the
necessary
delegations
of
sovereignty
must
be
none
the
less
are
such
sacrifices
and
difficulties
unavoidable
people
in
france
and
italy
and
great
britain
and
germany
alike
have
to
subdue
their
minds
to
the
realization
that
some
such
league
is
now
a
necessity
for
them
if
their
peace
and
national
life
are
to
continue
there
is
no
prospect
before
them
but
either
some
such
league
or
else
great
humiliation
and
disastrous
warfare
driving
them
down
towards
social
dissolution
and
for
the
united
states
it
is
only
a
question
of
a
little
longer
time
before
the
same
alternatives
have
to
be
faced
whether
this
war
ends
in
the
complete
defeat
of
germany
and
german
imperialism
or
in
a
revolutionary
modernization
of
germany
or
in
a
practical
triumph
for
the
hohenzollerns
are
considerations
that
affect
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
league
but
do
not
affect
its
essential
necessity
in
the
first
two
cases
the
league
of
free
nations
will
be
a
world
league
including
germany
as
a
principal
partner
in
the
latter
case
the
league
of
free
nations
will
be
a
defensive
league
standing
steadfast
against
the
threat
of
a
world
imperialism
and
watching
and
restraining
with
one
common
will
the
homicidal
maniac
in
its
midst
but
in
all
these
cases
there
can
be
no
great
alleviation
of
the
evils
that
now
blacken
and
threaten
to
ruin
human
life
altogether
unless
all
the
civilized
and
peoples
of
the
world
are
pledged
and
locked
together
under
a
common
law
and
a
common
world
policy
there
must
rather
be
an
intensification
of
these
evils
there
must
be
wars
more
evil
than
this
war
continuing
this
war
and
more
destructive
of
civilized
life
there
can
be
no
peace
and
hope
for
our
race
but
an
organized
peace
and
hope
armed
against
disturbance
as
a
state
is
armed
against
mad
ferocious
and
criminal
men
now
there
are
two
chief
arguments
running
one
into
the
other
for
the
necessity
of
merging
our
existing
sovereignties
into
a
greater
and
if
possible
a
league
the
first
is
the
present
geographical
impossibility
of
nearly
all
the
existing
european
states
and
empires
and
the
second
is
the
steadily
increasing
disproportion
between
the
tortures
and
destructions
inflicted
by
modern
warfare
and
any
possible
advantages
that
may
arise
from
it
underlying
both
arguments
is
the
fact
that
modern
developments
of
mechanical
science
have
brought
the
nations
of
europe
together
into
too
close
a
proximity
this
present
war
more
than
anything
else
is
a
violent
struggle
between
old
political
ideas
and
new
antagonistic
conditions
it
is
the
unhappy
usage
of
our
schools
and
universities
to
study
the
history
of
mankind
only
during
periods
of
mechanical
unprogressiveness
the
historical
ideas
of
europe
range
between
the
time
when
the
greeks
were
going
about
the
world
on
foot
or
horseback
or
in
galleys
or
sailing
ships
to
the
days
when
napoleon
wellington
and
nelson
were
going
about
at
very
much
the
same
pace
in
much
the
same
vehicles
and
vessels
at
the
advent
of
steam
and
electricity
the
muse
of
history
holds
her
nose
and
shuts
her
eyes
science
will
study
and
get
the
better
of
a
modern
disease
as
for
example
sleeping
sickness
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
has
no
classical
standing
but
our
history
schools
would
be
shocked
at
the
bare
idea
of
studying
the
effect
of
modern
means
of
communication
upon
administrative
areas
large
or
small
this
defect
in
our
historical
training
has
made
our
minds
politically
sluggish
we
fail
to
adapt
readily
enough
in
small
things
and
great
alike
we
are
trying
to
run
the
world
in
areas
marked
out
in
or
before
the
eighteenth
century
regardless
of
the
fact
that
a
man
or
an
army
or
an
aeroplane
can
get
in
a
few
minutes
or
a
few
hours
to
points
that
it
would
have
taken
days
or
weeks
to
reach
under
the
old
conditions
that
matters
nothing
to
the
learned
men
who
instruct
our
statesmen
and
politicians
it
matters
everything
from
the
point
of
view
of
social
and
economic
and
political
life
and
the
grave
fact
to
consider
is
that
all
the
great
states
of
europe
except
for
the
unification
of
italy
and
germany
are
still
much
of
the
size
and
in
much
the
same
boundaries
that
made
them
strong
and
safe
in
the
eighteenth
century
that
is
to
say
in
the
closing
years
of
the
period
the
british
empire
grew
and
was
organized
under
those
conditions
and
had
to
modify
itself
only
a
little
to
meet
the
needs
of
steam
shipping
all
over
the
world
are
its
linked
possessions
and
its
ports
and
coaling
stations
and
fastnesses
on
the
trade
routes
and
british
people
still
look
at
the
map
of
the
world
with
the
profoundest
blind
to
the
swift
changes
that
are
making
that
scattered
empire
if
it
is
to
remain
an
isolated
system
almost
the
most
dangerous
conceivable
let
me
ask
the
british
reader
who
is
disposed
to
sneer
at
the
league
of
nations
and
say
he
is
very
well
content
with
the
empire
thank
you
to
get
his
atlas
and
consider
one
or
two
propositions
and
first
let
him
think
of
aviation
i
can
assure
him
because
upon
this
matter
i
have
some
special
knowledge
that
air
travel
for
men
for
letters
and
light
goods
and
for
bombs
is
continually
becoming
more
practicable
but
the
air
routes
that
air
transport
will
follow
must
go
over
a
certain
amount
of
land
for
this
reason
that
every
few
hundred
miles
at
the
longest
the
machine
must
come
down
for
petrol
a
flying
machine
with
a
safe
range
of
miles
is
still
a
long
way
off
it
may
indeed
be
permanently
impracticable
because
there
seems
to
be
an
upward
limit
to
the
size
of
an
aeroplane
engine
and
now
will
the
reader
take
the
map
of
the
world
and
study
the
air
routes
from
london
to
the
rest
of
the
empire
he
will
find
them
perplexing
if
he
wants
them
to
be
happily
this
is
not
a
british
difficulty
only
will
he
next
study
the
air
routes
from
paris
to
the
rest
of
the
french
possessions
and
finally
will
he
study
the
air
routes
out
of
germany
to
anywhere
the
germans
are
as
badly
off
as
any
people
but
we
are
all
badly
off
so
far
as
world
air
transit
goes
any
country
can
if
it
chooses
choke
any
adjacent
country
directly
any
trade
difficulty
breaks
out
any
country
can
begin
a
vexatious
campaign
against
its
neighbour
air
traffic
it
can
oblige
it
to
alight
at
the
frontier
to
follow
prescribed
routes
to
land
at
specified
places
on
those
routes
and
undergo
examinations
that
will
waste
precious
hours
but
so
far
as
i
can
see
no
european
statesman
german
or
allied
have
begun
to
give
their
attention
to
this
amazing
difficulty
without
a
great
pooling
of
air
control
either
a
pooling
or
a
pooling
at
least
of
the
allies
in
one
air
league
the
splendid
peace
possibilities
of
air
transport
and
they
are
indeed
splendid
must
remain
very
largely
a
forbidden
possibility
to
mankind
and
as
a
second
illustration
of
the
way
in
which
changing
conditions
are
altering
political
questions
let
the
reader
take
his
atlas
and
consider
the
case
of
that
impregnable
fastness
that
great
naval
station
that
key
to
the
mediterranean
gibraltar
british
boys
are
brought
up
on
gibraltar
and
the
gibraltar
idea
to
the
british
imagination
gibraltar
is
almost
as
sacred
a
national
symbol
as
the
lions
in
trafalgar
square
now
in
his
atlas
the
reader
will
almost
certainly
find
an
inset
map
of
this
valuable
possession
coloured
bright
red
the
inset
map
will
have
attached
to
it
a
small
scale
of
miles
from
that
he
will
be
able
to
satisfy
himself
that
there
is
not
an
inch
of
the
rock
anywhere
that
is
not
within
five
miles
or
less
of
spanish
land
and
that
there
is
rather
more
than
a
semicircle
of
hills
round
the
rock
within
a
range
of
seven
or
eight
miles
that
is
much
less
than
the
range
of
a
gun
in
other
words
the
spaniards
are
in
a
position
to
knock
gibraltar
to
bits
whenever
they
want
to
do
so
or
to
smash
and
sink
any
ships
in
its
harbour
they
can
hit
it
on
every
side
consider
moreover
that
there
are
long
sweeps
of
coast
north
south
and
west
of
the
rock
from
which
torpedoes
could
be
discharged
at
any
ship
that
approached
inquire
further
where
on
the
rock
an
aeroplane
can
land
and
having
ascertained
these
things
ask
yourself
what
is
the
present
value
of
gibraltar
i
will
not
multiply
disagreeable
instances
of
this
sort
though
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
do
so
in
the
case
both
of
france
and
italy
as
well
as
of
great
britain
i
give
them
as
illustrations
of
the
way
in
which
everywhere
old
securities
and
old
arrangements
must
be
upset
by
the
greater
range
of
modern
things
let
us
get
on
to
more
general
conditions
there
is
not
a
capital
city
in
europe
that
twenty
years
from
now
will
not
be
liable
to
a
bombing
raid
done
by
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
big
aeroplanes
upon
or
even
before
a
declaration
of
war
and
there
is
not
a
line
of
sea
communication
that
will
not
be
as
promptly
interrupted
by
the
hostile
submarine
i
point
these
things
out
here
only
to
carry
home
the
fact
that
the
ideas
of
sovereign
isolation
and
detachment
that
were
perfectly
valid
in
the
empire
imperial
zollverein
and
all
that
stuff
and
damn
the
foreigner
are
now
because
of
the
enormous
changes
in
range
of
action
and
facility
of
locomotion
that
have
been
going
on
almost
as
wild
or
would
be
if
we
were
not
so
fatally
accustomed
to
them
and
quite
as
dangerous
as
the
idea
of
setting
up
a
free
and
sovereign
state
in
the
isle
of
dogs
all
the
european
empires
are
becoming
vulnerable
at
every
point
surely
the
moral
is
obvious
the
only
wise
course
before
the
allied
european
powers
now
is
to
put
their
national
conceit
in
their
pockets
and
to
combine
to
lock
up
their
foreign
policy
their
trade
interests
and
all
their
imperial
and
international
interests
into
a
league
so
big
as
to
be
able
to
withstand
the
most
sudden
and
treacherous
of
blows
and
surely
the
only
completely
safe
course
for
them
and
mankind
hard
and
nearly
impossible
though
it
may
seem
at
the
present
juncture
is
for
them
to
lock
up
into
one
unity
with
a
democratized
germany
and
with
all
the
other
states
of
the
earth
into
one
league
if
the
reader
will
revert
again
to
his
atlas
he
will
see
very
clearly
that
a
strongly
consolidated
league
of
free
nations
even
if
it
consisted
only
of
our
present
allies
would
in
itself
form
a
combination
with
so
close
a
system
of
communication
about
the
world
and
so
great
an
economic
advantage
that
in
the
long
run
it
could
oblige
germany
and
the
rest
of
the
world
to
come
in
to
its
council
divided
the
oceanic
allies
are
to
speak
plainly
geographical
rags
and
nakedness
united
they
are
a
world
to
set
about
organizing
that
league
now
with
its
necessary
repudiation
on
the
part
of
britain
france
and
italy
of
a
selfish
and
it
must
be
remembered
in
the
light
of
these
things
i
have
but
hinted
at
here
a
hopelessly
unpracticable
would
i
am
convinced
lead
quite
rapidly
to
a
great
change
of
heart
in
germany
and
to
a
satisfactory
peace
but
even
if
i
am
wrong
in
that
then
all
the
stronger
is
the
reason
for
binding
locking
and
uniting
the
allied
powers
together
it
is
the
most
dangerous
of
delusions
for
each
and
all
of
them
to
suppose
that
either
britain
france
or
italy
can
ever
stand
alone
again
and
be
secure
and
turning
now
to
the
other
aspect
of
these
consequences
of
the
development
of
material
science
it
is
too
often
assumed
that
this
war
is
being
as
horrible
and
destructive
as
war
can
be
there
never
was
so
great
a
delusion
this
war
has
only
begun
to
be
horrible
no
doubt
it
is
much
more
horrible
and
destructive
than
any
former
war
but
even
in
comparison
with
the
full
possibilities
of
known
and
existing
means
of
destruction
it
is
still
a
mild
war
perhaps
it
will
never
rise
to
its
full
possibilities
at
the
present
stage
there
is
not
a
combatant
except
perhaps
america
which
is
not
now
practising
a
pinching
economy
of
steel
and
other
mechanical
material
the
germans
are
running
short
of
flying
men
and
if
we
and
our
allies
continue
to
press
the
air
attack
and
seek
out
and
train
our
own
vastly
greater
resources
of
first
quality
young
airmen
the
germans
may
come
as
near
to
being
driven
out
of
the
air
as
is
possible
i
am
a
firmer
believer
than
ever
i
was
in
the
possibility
of
a
complete
victory
over
germany
through
and
by
the
air
but
the
occasional
dropping
of
a
big
bomb
or
so
in
london
is
not
to
be
taken
as
anything
but
a
minimum
display
of
what
air
war
can
do
in
a
little
while
now
our
alliance
should
be
in
a
position
to
commence
day
and
night
continuous
attacks
upon
the
rhine
towns
not
raids
such
as
london
knows
but
raids
then
and
then
only
shall
we
be
able
to
gauge
the
really
horrible
possibilities
of
the
air
war
they
are
in
our
hands
and
not
in
the
hands
of
the
germans
in
addition
the
germans
are
at
a
huge
disadvantage
in
their
submarine
campaign
their
submarine
campaign
is
only
the
feeble
shadow
of
what
a
submarine
campaign
might
be
turning
again
to
the
atlas
the
reader
can
see
for
himself
that
the
german
and
austrian
submarines
are
obliged
to
come
out
across
very
narrow
fronts
a
fence
of
mines
less
than
three
hundred
miles
long
and
two
hundred
feet
deep
would
for
example
completely
bar
their
exit
through
the
north
sea
the
run
the
gauntlet
of
that
long
narrow
sea
and
pay
a
heavy
toll
to
it
if
only
our
admiralty
would
tell
the
german
public
what
that
toll
is
now
there
would
come
a
time
when
german
seamen
would
no
longer
consent
to
go
down
in
them
consider
however
what
a
submarine
campaign
would
be
for
great
britain
if
instead
of
struggling
through
this
it
were
conducted
from
the
coast
of
norway
where
these
pests
might
harbour
in
a
hundred
fiords
consider
too
what
this
weapon
may
be
in
twenty
time
in
the
hands
of
a
country
in
the
position
of
the
united
states
great
britain
if
she
is
not
altogether
mad
will
cease
to
be
an
island
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
war
by
piercing
the
channel
tunnel
how
different
our
transport
problem
would
be
if
we
had
that
now
but
such
countries
as
australia
new
zealand
and
japan
directly
they
are
involved
in
the
future
in
a
war
against
any
efficient
naval
power
with
an
unimpeded
sea
access
will
be
isolated
forthwith
i
can
not
conceive
that
any
of
the
great
ocean
powers
will
rest
content
until
such
a
tremendous
possibility
of
blockade
as
the
submarine
has
created
is
securely
vested
in
the
hands
of
a
common
league
beyond
any
power
of
sudden
abuse
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
this
war
is
a
mechanical
war
conducted
by
men
whose
discipline
renders
them
uninventive
who
know
little
or
nothing
of
mechanism
who
are
for
the
most
part
struggling
blindly
to
get
things
back
to
the
conditions
for
which
they
were
trained
to
napoleonic
conditions
with
infantry
and
cavalry
and
comparatively
light
guns
the
war
of
manoeuvres
it
is
like
a
man
engaged
in
a
desperate
duel
who
keeps
on
trying
to
make
it
a
game
of
cricket
most
of
these
soldiers
detest
every
sort
of
mechanical
device
the
tanks
for
example
which
used
with
imagination
might
have
given
the
british
and
french
overwhelming
victory
on
the
western
front
were
subordinated
to
the
usual
cavalry
break
through
idea
i
am
not
making
any
particular
complaint
against
the
british
and
french
generals
in
saying
this
it
is
what
must
happen
to
any
country
which
entrusts
its
welfare
to
soldiers
a
soldier
has
to
be
a
severely
disciplined
man
and
a
severely
disciplined
man
can
not
be
a
versatile
man
and
on
the
whole
the
british
army
has
been
as
receptive
to
novelties
as
any
the
german
generals
have
done
no
better
indeed
they
have
not
done
so
well
as
the
generals
of
the
allies
in
this
respect
but
after
the
war
if
the
world
does
not
organize
rapidly
for
peace
then
as
resources
accumulate
a
little
the
mechanical
genius
will
get
to
work
on
the
possibilities
of
these
ideas
that
have
merely
been
sketched
out
in
this
war
we
shall
get
big
land
ironclads
which
will
smash
towns
we
shall
get
air
offensives
let
the
experienced
london
reader
think
of
an
air
raid
going
on
hour
after
hour
day
after
day
that
will
really
burn
out
and
wreck
towns
that
will
drive
people
mad
by
the
thousand
we
shall
get
a
very
complete
cessation
of
sea
transit
even
land
transit
may
be
enormously
hampered
by
aerial
attack
i
doubt
if
any
sort
of
social
order
will
really
be
able
to
stand
the
strain
of
a
fully
worked
out
modern
war
we
have
still
of
course
to
feel
the
full
shock
effects
even
of
this
war
most
of
the
combatants
are
going
on
as
sometimes
men
who
have
incurred
grave
wounds
will
still
go
on
for
a
time
without
feeling
them
the
educational
biological
social
economic
punishment
that
has
already
been
taken
by
each
of
the
european
countries
is
i
feel
very
much
greater
than
we
yet
realize
russia
the
heaviest
and
combatant
has
indeed
shown
the
effects
and
is
down
and
sick
but
in
three
years
time
all
europe
will
know
far
better
than
it
does
now
the
full
price
of
this
war
and
the
shock
effects
of
the
next
war
will
have
much
the
same
relation
to
the
shock
effects
of
this
as
the
shock
of
breaking
a
has
to
the
shock
of
crushing
in
a
body
in
russia
we
have
seen
not
indeed
social
revolution
not
the
replacement
of
one
social
order
by
another
but
disintegration
let
not
national
conceit
blind
us
germany
france
italy
britain
are
all
slipping
about
on
that
same
slope
down
which
russia
has
slid
which
goes
first
it
is
hard
to
guess
or
whether
we
shall
all
hold
out
to
some
kind
of
peace
at
present
the
social
discipline
of
france
and
britain
seems
to
be
at
least
as
good
as
that
of
germany
and
the
of
the
rhineland
and
bavaria
has
probably
to
undergo
very
severe
testing
by
systematized
and
steadily
increasing
air
punishment
as
this
year
goes
on
the
next
war
if
a
next
war
comes
will
see
all
germany
from
end
to
end
vulnerable
to
aircraft
such
are
the
two
sets
of
considerations
that
will
i
think
ultimately
prevail
over
every
prejudice
and
every
difficulty
in
the
way
of
the
league
of
free
nations
existing
states
have
become
impossible
as
absolutely
independent
sovereignties
the
new
conditions
bring
them
so
close
together
and
give
them
such
extravagant
powers
of
mutual
injury
that
they
must
either
sink
national
pride
and
dynastic
ambitions
in
subordination
to
the
common
welfare
of
mankind
or
else
utterly
shatter
one
another
it
becomes
more
and
more
plainly
a
choice
between
the
league
of
free
nations
and
a
famished
race
of
men
looting
in
search
of
food
amidst
the
smouldering
ruins
of
civilization
in
the
end
i
believe
that
the
common
sense
of
mankind
will
prefer
a
revision
of
its
ideas
of
nationality
and
imperialism
to
the
latter
alternative
it
may
take
obstinate
men
a
few
more
years
yet
of
blood
and
horror
to
learn
this
lesson
but
for
my
own
part
i
cherish
an
obstinate
belief
in
the
potential
reasonableness
of
mankind
ix
democracy
all
the
talk
all
the
aspiration
and
work
that
is
making
now
towards
this
conception
of
a
world
securely
at
peace
under
the
direction
of
a
league
of
free
nations
has
interwoven
with
it
an
idea
that
is
often
rather
felt
than
understood
the
idea
of
democracy
not
only
is
justice
to
prevail
between
race
and
race
and
nation
and
nation
but
also
between
man
and
man
there
is
to
be
a
universal
respect
for
human
life
throughout
the
earth
the
world
in
the
words
of
president
wilson
is
to
be
made
safe
for
democracy
i
would
like
to
subject
that
word
to
a
certain
scrutiny
to
see
whether
the
things
we
are
apt
to
think
and
assume
about
it
correspond
exactly
with
the
feeling
of
the
word
i
would
like
to
ask
what
under
modern
conditions
does
democracy
mean
and
whether
we
have
got
it
now
anywhere
in
the
world
in
its
fulness
and
completion
and
to
begin
with
i
must
have
a
quarrel
with
the
word
itself
the
eccentricities
of
modern
education
make
us
dependent
for
a
number
of
our
primary
political
terms
upon
those
used
by
the
thinkers
of
the
small
greek
republics
of
ancient
times
before
those
petty
states
collapsed
through
sheer
political
ineptitude
before
the
macedonians
they
thought
in
terms
of
states
so
small
that
it
was
possible
to
gather
all
the
citizens
together
for
the
purposes
of
legislation
these
states
were
scarcely
more
than
what
we
english
might
call
sovereign
urban
districts
fast
communications
were
made
by
runners
even
the
policeman
with
a
bicycle
of
the
modern
urban
district
was
beyond
the
scope
of
the
greek
imagination
there
were
no
railways
telegraphs
telephones
books
or
newspapers
there
was
no
need
for
the
state
to
maintain
a
system
of
education
and
the
affairs
of
the
state
were
so
simple
that
they
could
be
discussed
and
decided
by
the
human
voice
and
open
voting
in
an
assembly
of
all
the
citizens
that
is
what
democracy
meant
in
andorra
or
perhaps
in
canton
uri
such
democracy
may
still
be
possible
in
any
other
modern
state
it
can
not
exist
the
opposite
term
to
it
was
oligarchy
in
which
a
small
council
of
men
controlled
the
affairs
of
the
state
oligarchy
narrowed
down
to
one
man
became
monarchy
if
you
wished
to
be
polite
to
an
oligarchy
you
called
it
an
aristocracy
if
you
wished
to
point
out
that
a
monarch
was
rather
by
way
of
being
you
called
him
a
tyrant
an
oligarchy
with
a
property
qualification
was
a
plutocracy
now
the
modern
intelligence
being
under
a
sort
of
magic
slavery
to
the
ancient
greeks
has
to
adapt
all
these
terms
to
the
problems
of
states
so
vast
and
complex
that
they
have
the
same
relation
to
the
greek
states
that
the
anatomy
of
a
man
has
to
the
anatomy
of
a
jellyfish
they
are
not
only
greater
in
extent
and
denser
in
population
but
they
are
increasingly
innervated
by
more
and
more
rapid
means
of
communication
and
excitement
in
the
classical
past
except
for
such
special
cases
as
the
feeding
of
rome
with
egyptian
corn
trade
was
a
traffic
in
luxuries
or
slaves
war
a
small
specialized
affair
of
infantry
and
horsemen
in
search
of
slaves
and
loot
and
empire
the
exaction
of
tribute
the
modern
state
must
conduct
its
enormous
businesses
through
a
system
of
ministries
its
vital
interests
go
all
round
the
earth
nothing
that
any
ancient
greek
would
have
recognized
as
democracy
is
conceivable
in
a
great
modern
state
it
is
absolutely
necessary
if
we
are
to
get
things
clear
in
our
minds
about
what
democracy
really
means
in
relation
to
modern
politics
first
to
make
a
quite
fresh
classification
in
order
to
find
what
items
there
really
are
to
consider
and
then
to
inquire
which
seem
to
correspond
more
or
less
closely
in
spirit
with
our
ideas
about
ancient
democracy
now
there
are
two
primary
classes
of
idea
about
government
in
the
modern
world
depending
upon
our
conception
of
the
political
capacity
of
the
common
man
we
may
suppose
he
is
a
microcosm
with
complete
ideas
and
wishes
about
the
state
and
the
world
or
we
may
suppose
that
he
is
we
may
believe
that
the
common
man
can
govern
or
we
may
believe
that
he
ca
we
may
think
further
along
the
first
line
that
he
is
so
wise
and
good
and
right
that
we
only
have
to
get
out
of
his
way
for
him
to
act
rightly
and
for
the
good
of
all
mankind
or
we
may
doubt
it
and
if
we
doubt
that
we
may
still
believe
that
though
perhaps
you
can
fool
all
the
people
some
of
the
time
and
some
of
the
people
all
the
time
the
common
man
expressing
himself
by
a
majority
vote
still
remains
the
secure
source
of
human
wisdom
but
next
while
we
may
deny
this
universal
distribution
of
political
wisdom
we
may
if
we
are
sufficiently
under
the
sway
of
modern
ideas
about
collective
psychology
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
poke
up
the
political
indifference
and
inability
of
the
common
man
as
much
as
possible
to
thrust
political
ideas
and
facts
upon
him
to
incite
him
to
a
watchful
and
critical
attitude
towards
them
and
above
all
to
secure
his
assent
to
the
proceedings
of
the
able
people
who
are
managing
public
affairs
or
finally
we
may
treat
him
as
a
thing
to
be
ruled
and
not
consulted
let
me
at
this
stage
make
out
a
classificatory
diagram
of
these
elementary
ideas
of
government
in
a
modern
country
class
i
it
is
supposed
that
the
common
man
govern
without
further
organization
anarchy
through
a
majority
vote
by
delegates
class
ii
it
is
supposed
that
the
common
man
govern
and
that
government
therefore
must
be
through
the
agency
of
able
persons
who
may
be
classified
under
one
of
the
following
either
as
persons
elected
by
the
common
man
because
he
believes
them
to
be
persons
able
to
govern
just
as
he
chooses
his
doctors
as
persons
able
to
secure
health
and
his
electrical
engineers
as
persons
able
to
attend
to
his
tramways
lighting
etc
persons
of
a
special
class
as
for
example
persons
born
and
educated
to
rule
or
rich
business
adventurers
plutocracy
who
rule
without
consulting
the
common
man
at
all
to
which
two
we
may
perhaps
add
a
sort
of
intermediate
stage
between
them
namely
persons
elected
by
a
special
class
of
voter
monarchy
may
be
either
a
special
case
of
class
ii
or
in
which
the
persons
who
rule
have
narrowed
down
in
number
to
one
person
and
the
duration
of
monarchy
may
be
either
for
life
or
a
term
of
years
these
two
classes
and
the
five
cover
i
believe
all
the
elementary
political
types
in
our
world
now
in
the
constitution
of
a
modern
state
because
of
the
conflict
and
confusion
of
ideas
all
or
most
of
these
five
may
usually
be
found
intertwined
the
british
constitution
for
instance
is
a
complicated
tangle
of
arrangements
due
to
a
struggle
between
the
ideas
of
class
i
class
ii
tending
to
become
class
ii
and
class
ii
in
both
its
aristocratic
and
monarchist
forms
the
american
constitution
is
largely
dominated
by
class
i
from
which
it
breaks
away
in
the
case
of
the
president
to
a
monarchist
aspect
of
class
i
will
not
elaborate
this
classification
further
i
have
made
it
here
in
order
to
render
clear
first
that
what
we
moderns
mean
by
democracy
is
not
what
the
greeks
meant
at
all
that
is
to
say
direct
government
by
the
assembly
of
all
the
citizens
and
secondly
and
more
important
that
the
word
democracy
is
being
used
very
largely
in
current
discussion
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
in
any
particular
case
whether
the
intention
is
class
i
or
class
ii
and
that
we
have
to
make
up
our
minds
whether
we
mean
if
i
may
coin
two
phrases
delegate
democracy
or
selective
democracy
or
some
definite
combination
of
these
two
when
we
talk
about
democracy
before
we
can
get
on
much
beyond
a
generous
gesture
of
equality
and
enfranchisement
towards
our
brother
man
the
word
is
being
used
in
fact
confusingly
for
these
two
quite
widely
different
things
now
it
seems
to
me
that
though
there
has
been
no
very
clear
discussion
of
the
issue
between
those
two
very
opposite
conceptions
of
democracy
largely
because
of
the
want
of
proper
distinctive
terms
there
has
nevertheless
been
a
wide
movement
of
public
opinion
away
from
delegate
democracy
and
towards
selective
democracy
people
have
gone
on
saying
democracy
while
gradually
changing
its
meaning
from
the
former
to
the
latter
it
is
notable
in
great
britain
for
example
that
while
there
has
been
no
perceptible
diminution
in
our
faith
in
democracy
there
has
been
a
growing
criticism
of
party
and
politicians
and
a
great
weakening
in
the
power
and
influence
of
representatives
and
representative
institutions
there
has
been
a
growing
demand
for
personality
and
initiative
in
elected
persons
the
press
which
was
once
entirely
subordinate
politically
to
parliamentary
politics
adopts
an
attitude
towards
parliament
and
party
leaders
nowadays
which
would
have
seemed
inconceivable
insolence
in
the
days
of
lord
palmerston
and
there
has
been
a
vigorous
agitation
in
support
of
electoral
methods
which
are
manifestly
calculated
to
subordinate
delegated
to
selected
men
the
movement
for
electoral
reform
in
great
britain
at
the
present
time
is
one
of
quite
fundamental
importance
in
the
development
of
modern
democracy
the
case
of
the
reformers
is
that
heretofore
modern
democracy
has
not
had
a
fair
opportunity
of
showing
its
best
possibilities
to
the
world
because
the
methods
of
election
have
persistently
set
aside
the
better
types
of
public
men
or
rather
of
public
men
in
favour
of
mere
party
hacks
that
is
a
story
common
to
britain
and
the
american
democracies
but
in
america
it
was
expressed
in
rather
different
terms
and
dealt
with
in
a
less
analytical
fashion
than
it
has
been
in
great
britain
it
was
not
at
first
clearly
understood
that
the
failure
of
democracy
to
produce
good
government
came
through
the
preference
of
delegated
over
selected
men
the
idea
of
delegation
did
in
fact
dominate
the
minds
of
both
electoral
reformers
and
electoral
conservatives
alike
and
the
earlier
stages
of
the
reform
movement
in
great
britain
were
inspired
not
so
much
by
the
idea
of
getting
a
better
type
of
representative
as
by
the
idea
of
getting
a
fairer
representation
of
minorities
it
was
only
slowly
that
the
idea
that
sensible
men
do
not
usually
belong
to
any
political
party
took
hold
it
is
only
now
being
realized
that
what
sensible
men
desire
in
a
member
of
parliament
is
honour
and
capacity
rather
than
a
mechanical
loyalty
to
a
platform
they
do
not
want
to
dictate
to
their
representative
they
want
a
man
they
can
trust
as
their
representative
in
the
fifties
and
sixties
of
the
last
century
in
which
this
electoral
reform
movement
began
and
the
method
of
proportional
representation
was
thought
out
it
was
possible
for
the
reformers
to
work
untroubled
upon
the
assumption
that
if
a
man
was
not
necessarily
born
a
little
or
else
a
little
conservative
he
must
at
least
be
a
or
a
conservative
but
seeking
a
fair
representation
for
party
minorities
these
reformers
produced
a
system
of
voting
at
once
simple
and
incapable
of
manipulation
that
leads
straight
not
to
the
representation
of
small
parties
but
to
a
type
of
democratic
government
by
selected
best
men
before
giving
the
essential
features
of
that
system
it
may
be
well
to
state
in
its
simplest
form
the
evils
at
which
the
reform
aims
an
election
the
reformers
point
out
is
not
the
simple
matter
it
appears
to
be
at
the
first
blush
methods
of
voting
can
be
manipulated
in
various
ways
and
nearly
every
method
has
its
own
liability
to
falsification
we
may
take
for
illustration
the
commonest
simplest
case
the
case
that
is
the
perplexity
of
every
voter
under
british
or
american
conditions
the
case
of
a
constituency
in
which
every
elector
has
one
vote
and
which
returns
one
representative
to
parliament
the
naive
theory
on
which
people
go
is
that
all
the
possible
candidates
are
put
up
that
each
voter
votes
for
the
one
he
likes
best
and
that
the
best
man
wins
the
bitter
experience
is
that
hardly
ever
are
there
more
than
two
candidates
and
still
more
rarely
is
either
of
these
the
best
man
possible
suppose
for
example
the
constituency
is
mainly
conservative
a
little
group
of
pothouse
politicians
busybodies
local
journalists
and
small
lawyers
working
for
various
monetary
interests
have
captured
the
local
conservative
organization
they
have
time
and
energy
to
capture
it
because
they
have
no
other
interest
in
life
except
that
it
is
their
business
and
honest
men
are
busy
with
other
duties
for
reasons
that
do
not
appear
these
local
workers
put
up
an
unknown
goldbug
as
the
official
conservative
candidate
he
professes
a
generally
conservative
view
of
things
but
few
people
are
sure
of
him
and
few
people
trust
him
against
him
the
weaker
and
therefore
still
more
venal
liberal
organization
now
puts
up
a
kentshire
formerly
wurstberg
to
represent
the
broader
thought
and
finer
generosities
of
the
english
mind
a
number
of
conservative
gentlemen
generally
too
busy
about
their
honest
businesses
to
attend
the
party
smokers
and
the
party
cave
realize
suddenly
that
they
want
goldbug
hardly
more
than
they
want
wurstberg
they
put
up
their
trusted
and
able
friend
mr
sanity
as
an
independent
conservative
every
one
knows
the
trouble
that
follows
mr
sanity
is
going
to
split
the
party
vote
the
hesitating
voter
is
told
with
considerable
truth
that
a
vote
given
for
mr
sanity
is
a
vote
given
for
wurstberg
at
any
price
the
constituency
does
not
want
wurstberg
so
at
the
eleventh
hour
mr
sanity
is
induced
to
withdraw
and
goldbug
goes
into
parliament
to
misrepresent
this
constituency
and
so
with
most
constituencies
and
the
result
is
a
legislative
body
consisting
largely
of
men
of
unknown
character
and
obscure
aims
whose
only
credential
is
the
wearing
of
a
party
label
they
come
into
parliament
not
to
forward
the
great
interests
they
ostensibly
support
but
with
an
eye
to
the
railway
jobbery
corporation
business
concessions
and
financial
operations
that
necessarily
go
on
in
and
about
the
national
legislature
that
in
its
simplest
form
is
the
dilemma
of
democracy
the
problem
that
has
confronted
modern
democracy
since
its
beginning
has
not
really
been
the
representation
of
organized
minorities
they
are
very
well
able
to
look
after
themselves
but
protection
of
the
unorganized
mass
of
busily
occupied
fairly
intelligent
men
from
the
tricks
of
the
specialists
who
work
the
party
we
know
mr
sanity
we
want
mr
sanity
but
we
are
too
busy
to
watch
the
incessant
intrigues
to
oust
him
in
favour
of
the
obscurely
influential
people
politically
docile
who
are
favoured
by
the
organization
we
want
an
method
of
voting
it
is
in
answer
to
this
demand
as
the
outcome
of
a
most
careful
examination
of
the
ways
in
which
voting
may
be
protected
from
the
exploitation
of
those
who
elections
that
the
method
of
proportional
representation
with
a
single
transferable
vote
has
been
evolved
it
is
it
defies
the
caucus
if
you
do
not
like
goldbug
you
can
put
up
and
vote
for
mr
sanity
giving
goldbug
your
second
choice
in
the
most
perfect
confidence
that
in
any
case
your
vote
can
not
help
to
return
wurstberg
with
proportional
representation
with
a
single
transferable
vote
this
specification
is
necessary
because
there
are
also
the
inferior
imitations
of
various
figuring
as
proportional
representation
it
is
to
prevent
the
effective
candidature
of
independent
men
of
repute
beside
the
official
the
method
of
voting
under
the
proportional
representation
system
has
been
ignorantly
represented
as
complex
it
is
really
almost
ideally
simple
you
mark
the
list
of
candidates
with
numbers
in
the
order
of
your
preference
for
example
you
believe
a
to
be
absolutely
the
best
man
for
parliament
you
mark
him
but
b
you
think
is
the
next
best
man
you
mark
him
that
means
that
if
a
gets
an
enormous
amount
of
support
ever
so
many
more
votes
than
he
requires
for
his
return
your
vote
will
not
be
wasted
only
so
much
of
your
vote
as
is
needed
will
go
to
a
the
rest
will
go
to
b
or
on
the
other
hand
if
a
has
so
little
support
that
his
chances
are
hopeless
you
will
not
have
thrown
your
vote
away
upon
him
it
will
go
to
b
similarly
you
may
indicate
a
third
a
fourth
and
a
fifth
choice
if
you
like
you
may
mark
every
name
on
your
paper
with
a
number
to
indicate
the
order
of
your
preferences
and
that
is
all
the
voter
has
to
do
the
reckoning
and
counting
of
the
votes
presents
not
the
slightest
difficulty
to
any
one
used
to
the
business
of
computation
silly
and
dishonest
men
appealing
to
still
sillier
audiences
have
got
themselves
and
their
audiences
into
humorous
muddles
over
this
business
but
the
principles
are
perfectly
plain
and
simple
let
me
state
them
here
they
can
be
fully
and
exactly
stated
with
various
ornaments
comments
arguments
sarcastic
remarks
and
digressions
in
seventy
lines
of
this
type
it
will
be
evident
that
in
any
election
under
this
system
any
one
who
has
got
a
certain
proportion
of
no
votes
will
be
elected
if
for
instance
five
people
have
to
be
elected
and
voters
vote
then
any
one
who
has
got
first
votes
or
more
be
elected
votes
is
in
that
case
enough
to
elect
a
candidate
this
sufficient
number
of
votes
is
called
the
and
any
one
who
has
more
than
that
number
of
votes
has
obviously
got
more
votes
than
is
needful
for
election
so
to
begin
with
the
voting
papers
are
classified
according
to
their
first
votes
and
any
candidates
who
have
got
more
than
a
quota
of
first
votes
are
forthwith
declared
elected
but
most
of
these
elected
men
would
under
the
old
system
waste
votes
because
they
would
have
too
many
for
manifestly
a
candidate
who
gets
more
than
the
quota
of
votes
only
a
fraction
of
each
of
these
votes
to
return
if
for
instance
he
gets
double
the
quota
he
needs
only
half
each
vote
he
takes
that
fraction
therefore
under
this
new
and
better
system
and
the
rest
of
each
vote
is
entered
on
to
no
upon
that
voting
paper
and
so
on
now
this
is
an
extremely
easy
job
for
an
accountant
or
skilled
computer
and
it
is
quite
easily
checked
by
any
other
accountant
and
skilled
computer
a
reader
with
a
bad
arithmetical
education
ignorant
of
the
very
existence
of
such
a
thing
as
a
slide
rule
knowing
nothing
of
account
keeping
who
thinks
of
himself
working
out
the
resultant
fractions
with
a
stumpy
pencil
on
a
bit
of
greasy
paper
in
a
bad
light
may
easily
think
of
this
transfer
of
fractions
as
a
dangerous
and
terrifying
process
it
is
for
a
properly
trained
man
the
easiest
exactest
job
conceivable
the
cash
register
people
will
invent
machines
to
do
it
for
you
while
you
wait
what
happens
then
is
that
every
candidate
with
more
than
a
quota
beginning
with
the
top
candidate
sheds
a
traction
of
each
vote
he
has
received
down
the
list
and
the
next
one
sheds
his
surplus
fraction
in
the
same
way
and
so
on
until
candidates
lower
in
the
list
who
are
at
first
below
the
quota
fill
up
to
it
when
all
the
surplus
votes
of
the
candidates
at
the
head
of
the
list
have
been
disposed
of
then
the
hopeless
candidates
at
the
bottom
of
the
list
are
dealt
with
the
second
votes
on
their
voting
papers
are
treated
as
whole
votes
and
distributed
up
the
list
and
so
on
it
will
be
plain
to
the
that
towards
the
end
there
will
be
a
certain
chasing
about
of
little
fractions
of
votes
and
a
slight
modification
of
the
quota
due
to
voting
papers
having
no
second
or
third
preferences
marked
upon
them
a
chasing
about
that
it
will
be
difficult
for
an
untrained
intelligence
to
follow
untrained
intelligences
are
not
required
to
follow
for
the
skilled
computer
these
things
offer
no
difficulty
at
all
and
they
are
not
difficulties
of
principle
but
of
manipulation
one
might
as
well
refuse
to
travel
in
a
taxicab
until
the
driver
had
explained
the
magneto
as
refuse
to
accept
the
principle
of
proportional
representation
by
the
single
transferable
vote
until
one
had
remedied
all
the
deficiencies
of
one
arithmetical
education
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
thing
that
a
candidate
who
gets
more
votes
than
he
wants
is
made
to
hand
on
a
fraction
of
each
vote
to
the
voter
second
choice
and
that
a
candidate
whose
chances
are
hopeless
is
made
to
hand
on
the
whole
vote
to
the
voter
second
choice
so
that
practically
only
a
small
number
of
votes
are
ineffective
is
within
the
compass
of
the
mind
of
a
boy
of
ten
but
simple
as
this
method
is
it
completely
kills
the
organization
and
manipulation
of
voting
it
completely
solves
the
sanity
problem
it
is
short
of
forging
stealing
or
destroying
voting
papers
a
man
of
repute
a
leaderly
man
may
defy
all
the
party
organizations
in
existence
and
stand
beside
and
be
returned
over
the
head
of
a
worthless
man
though
the
latter
be
smothered
with
party
labels
that
is
the
gist
of
this
business
the
difference
in
effect
between
proportional
representation
and
the
old
method
of
voting
must
ultimately
be
to
change
the
moral
and
intellectual
quality
of
elected
persons
profoundly
people
are
only
beginning
to
realize
the
huge
possibilities
of
advance
inherent
in
this
change
of
political
method
it
means
no
less
than
a
revolution
from
delegate
democracy
to
selective
democracy
now
i
will
not
pretend
to
be
anything
but
a
strong
partizan
in
this
matter
when
i
speak
of
democracy
i
mean
selective
democracy
i
believe
that
delegate
democracy
is
already
provably
a
failure
in
the
world
and
that
the
reason
why
after
three
and
a
half
years
of
struggle
we
are
still
fighting
german
autocracy
and
fighting
with
no
certainty
of
absolute
victory
is
because
the
affairs
of
the
three
great
atlantic
democracies
have
been
largely
in
the
hands
not
of
selected
men
but
of
delegated
men
men
of
intrigue
and
the
party
machine
of
dodges
rather
than
initiatives
men
when
lord
haldane
defending
his
party
for
certain
insufficiencies
in
their
preparation
for
the
eventuality
of
the
great
war
pleaded
that
they
had
no
mandate
from
the
country
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
he
did
more
than
commit
political
suicide
he
bore
conclusive
witness
against
the
whole
system
which
had
made
him
what
he
was
neither
britain
nor
france
in
this
struggle
has
produced
better
statesmen
nor
better
generals
than
the
german
autocracy
the
british
and
french
foreign
offices
are
old
monarchist
organizations
still
to
this
day
the
british
and
french
politicians
haggle
and
argue
with
the
german
ministers
upon
petty
points
and
debating
society
advantages
smart
and
cunning
while
the
peoples
perish
the
one
man
who
has
risen
to
the
greatness
of
this
great
occasion
the
man
who
is
in
default
of
any
rival
rapidly
becoming
the
leader
of
the
world
towards
peace
is
neither
a
delegate
politician
nor
the
choice
of
a
monarch
and
his
councillors
he
is
the
one
authoritative
figure
in
these
transactions
whose
mind
has
not
been
subdued
either
by
long
discipline
in
the
party
machine
or
by
court
intrigue
who
has
continued
his
education
beyond
those
early
twenties
when
the
mind
of
the
budding
politician
ceases
to
expand
who
has
thought
and
thought
things
out
who
is
an
educated
man
among
dexterous
specialists
by
something
very
like
a
belated
accident
in
the
framing
of
the
american
constitution
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
selected
man
than
any
other
conspicuous
figure
at
the
present
time
he
is
specially
elected
by
a
special
electoral
college
after
an
elaborate
preliminary
selection
of
candidates
by
the
two
great
party
machines
and
be
it
remembered
that
wilson
is
not
the
first
great
president
the
united
states
have
had
he
is
one
of
a
series
of
figures
who
tower
over
their
european
contemporaries
the
united
states
have
had
many
advantageous
circumstances
to
thank
for
their
present
ascendancy
in
the
world
affairs
isolation
from
militarist
pressure
for
a
century
and
a
quarter
a
vast
virgin
continent
plenty
of
land
freedom
from
centralization
freedom
from
titles
and
social
vulgarities
common
schools
a
real
democratic
spirit
in
its
people
and
a
great
enthusiasm
for
universities
but
no
single
advantage
has
been
so
great
as
this
happy
accident
which
has
given
it
a
specially
selected
man
as
its
voice
and
figurehead
in
the
world
affairs
in
the
average
congressman
in
the
average
senator
as
ostrogorski
great
book
so
industriously
demonstrated
the
united
states
have
no
great
occasion
for
pride
neither
the
senate
nor
the
house
of
representatives
seem
to
rise
above
the
level
of
the
british
houses
of
parliament
with
a
government
unable
to
control
the
rebel
forces
of
ulster
unable
to
promote
or
dismiss
generals
without
an
outcry
weakly
amenable
to
the
press
and
terrifyingly
incapable
of
great
designs
it
is
to
the
united
states
of
america
we
must
look
now
if
the
world
is
to
be
made
safe
for
democracy
it
is
to
the
method
of
selection
as
distinguished
from
delegation
that
we
must
look
if
democracy
is
to
be
saved
from
itself
x
the
recent
struggle
for
proportional
representation
in
great
britain
british
political
life
resists
cleansing
with
all
the
vigour
of
a
dirty
little
boy
it
is
nothing
to
your
politician
that
the
economic
and
social
organization
of
all
the
world
is
strained
almost
to
the
pitch
of
collapse
and
that
it
is
vitally
important
to
mankind
that
everywhere
the
whole
will
and
intelligence
of
the
race
should
be
enlisted
in
the
great
tasks
of
making
a
permanent
peace
and
reconstructing
the
shattered
framework
of
society
these
are
remote
unreal
considerations
to
the
politician
what
is
the
world
to
him
he
has
scarcely
heard
of
it
he
has
been
far
too
busy
as
a
politician
he
has
been
thinking
of
smart
little
tricks
in
the
lobby
and
brilliant
exploits
at
question
time
he
has
been
thinking
of
jobs
and
appointments
of
whether
asquith
is
likely
to
come
back
and
how
far
it
is
safe
to
bank
upon
his
one
supreme
purpose
is
to
keep
affairs
in
the
hands
of
his
own
specialized
set
to
keep
the
old
obscure
party
game
going
to
rig
his
little
tricks
behind
a
vast
silly
camouflage
of
sham
issues
to
keep
out
able
men
and
disinterested
men
the
public
mind
and
the
general
intelligence
from
any
effective
interference
with
his
disastrous
manipulations
of
the
common
weal
i
do
not
see
how
any
intelligent
and
informed
man
can
have
followed
the
recent
debates
in
the
house
of
commons
upon
proportional
representation
without
some
gusts
of
angry
contempt
they
were
the
most
pitiful
and
alarming
demonstration
of
the
intellectual
and
moral
quality
of
british
public
life
at
the
present
time
from
the
of
the
fabian
society
and
from
the
party
organizers
of
both
liberal
and
tory
party
alike
and
from
the
knowing
cards
the
pothouse
shepherds
and
jobbing
lawyers
who
work
the
constituencies
comes
the
chief
opposition
to
this
straightening
out
of
our
electoral
system
so
urgently
necessary
and
so
long
overdue
they
have
fought
it
with
a
zeal
and
efficiency
that
is
rarely
displayed
in
the
nation
interest
from
nearly
every
outstanding
man
outside
that
little
inner
world
of
political
shams
and
dodges
who
has
given
any
attention
to
the
question
comes
on
the
other
hand
support
for
this
reform
even
the
great
party
leaders
balfour
and
asquith
were
in
its
favour
one
might
safely
judge
this
question
by
considering
who
are
the
advocates
on
either
side
but
the
best
arguments
for
proportional
representation
arise
out
of
its
opponents
speeches
and
to
these
i
will
confine
my
attention
now
consider
lord
harcourt
heir
to
the
most
sacred
traditions
of
the
party
game
hurling
scorn
at
a
project
that
would
introduce
faddists
mugwumps
and
so
on
and
so
on
in
fact
independent
thinking
men
into
the
legislature
consider
the
value
of
lord
curzon
statement
that
london
rose
in
revolt
against
the
project
do
you
remember
that
day
dear
reader
when
the
streets
of
london
boiled
with
passionate
men
shouting
no
proportional
representation
down
with
proportional
representation
you
do
nor
do
i
but
what
happened
was
that
the
and
solicitors
and
nobodies
the
party
hacks
who
form
the
bulk
of
misrepresentation
in
the
house
of
commons
stampeded
in
terror
against
a
proposal
that
threatened
to
wipe
them
out
and
replace
them
by
known
and
responsible
men
london
alas
does
not
seem
to
care
how
its
members
are
elected
what
londoner
knows
anything
about
his
member
hundreds
of
thousands
of
londoners
do
not
even
know
which
of
the
ridiculous
constituencies
into
which
the
politicians
have
dismembered
our
london
they
are
in
only
as
i
was
writing
this
in
my
flat
in
james
court
westminster
did
it
occur
to
me
to
inquire
who
was
representing
me
in
the
councils
of
the
nation
while
i
write
after
some
slight
difficulty
i
ascertained
that
my
representative
is
a
burdett
coutts
who
was
in
the
romantic
eighties
and
by
a
convenient
accident
i
find
that
the
other
day
he
moved
to
reject
the
proportional
representation
amendment
made
by
the
house
of
lords
to
the
representation
of
the
people
bill
so
that
i
am
able
to
look
up
the
debate
in
hansard
and
study
my
opinions
as
he
represented
them
and
this
question
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
taking
little
things
first
i
am
proud
and
happy
to
discover
that
the
member
for
me
was
the
only
participator
in
the
debate
who
in
the
vulgar
and
reprehensible
phrase
threw
a
dead
cat
or
in
polite
terms
displayed
classical
learning
my
member
said
danaos
et
dona
with
a
rather
graceful
compliment
to
the
labour
conference
at
nottingham
i
could
not
help
thinking
to
myself
said
my
member
that
at
that
conference
there
must
have
been
many
men
of
sufficient
classical
reading
to
say
to
themselves
danaos
et
dona
in
which
surmise
he
was
quite
right
except
perhaps
for
fugit
and
there
is
no
better
known
relic
of
antiquity
but
my
member
went
a
little
beyond
my
ideas
when
he
said
we
are
asked
to
enter
upon
a
method
of
legislation
which
can
bear
no
other
description
than
that
of
in
the
dark
because
i
think
it
can
bear
quite
a
lot
of
other
descriptions
this
was
however
the
artistic
prelude
to
a
large
vague
gloomy
dissertation
about
nothing
very
definite
a
muddling
up
of
the
main
question
with
the
minor
issue
of
a
schedule
of
constituencies
involved
in
the
proposal
the
other
parts
of
my
member
speech
do
not
i
confess
fill
me
with
the
easy
confidence
i
would
like
to
feel
in
my
proxy
let
me
extract
a
few
gems
of
eloquence
from
the
speech
of
this
voice
which
speaks
for
me
and
give
also
the
only
argument
he
advanced
that
needs
consideration
history
repeats
itself
he
said
very
often
in
curious
ways
as
to
facts
but
generally
with
very
different
results
that
honestly
i
like
it
is
a
sentence
one
can
read
over
several
times
but
he
went
on
to
talk
of
the
entirely
different
scheme
for
minority
representation
which
was
introduced
into
the
reform
bill
of
and
there
i
am
obliged
to
part
company
with
him
that
was
a
silly
scheme
for
giving
two
votes
to
each
voter
in
a
constituency
it
has
about
as
much
resemblance
to
the
method
of
scientific
voting
under
discussion
as
a
has
to
an
aeroplane
but
that
measure
of
minority
representation
led
to
a
baneful
invention
my
representative
went
on
to
say
and
left
behind
it
a
hateful
memory
in
the
birmingham
caucus
i
well
remember
that
when
i
stood
for
parliament
years
ago
had
no
better
platform
weapon
than
repeating
over
and
over
again
in
a
sentence
the
name
of
schnadhorst
and
i
am
not
sure
that
it
would
not
serve
the
same
purpose
now
under
that
system
the
work
of
the
caucus
was
of
course
far
simpler
than
it
will
be
if
this
system
ever
comes
into
operation
all
the
caucus
had
to
do
under
that
measure
was
to
divide
the
electors
into
three
groups
and
with
three
candidates
and
to
order
one
group
to
vote
for
and
another
for
and
and
the
third
for
and
and
they
carried
the
whole
of
their
candidates
and
kept
them
for
many
years
but
the
multiplicity
of
ordinal
preferences
second
third
fourth
fifth
up
to
tenth
which
the
single
transferable
vote
system
would
involve
will
require
a
more
scientific
handling
in
party
interests
and
neither
party
will
be
able
to
face
an
election
with
any
hope
of
success
without
the
assistance
of
the
most
drastic
form
of
caucus
and
its
orders
being
carried
out
by
the
now
i
swear
by
heaven
that
lowly
creature
as
i
am
a
lost
vote
a
nothing
voiceless
and
helpless
in
public
affairs
i
am
not
going
to
stand
the
imputation
that
that
sort
of
reasoning
represents
the
average
mental
quality
of
westminster
outside
parliament
that
is
most
of
my
neighbours
in
james
court
for
example
have
quite
large
pieces
of
head
above
their
eyebrows
read
these
above
sentences
over
and
ponder
their
significance
so
far
as
they
have
any
significance
never
mind
my
keen
personal
humiliation
at
this
display
of
the
mental
calibre
of
my
representative
but
consider
what
the
mental
calibre
of
a
house
must
be
that
did
not
break
out
into
loud
guffaws
at
such
a
passage
the
line
of
argument
is
about
as
lucid
as
if
one
reasoned
that
because
one
can
break
a
window
with
a
stone
it
is
no
use
buying
a
telescope
and
it
remains
entirely
a
matter
for
speculation
whether
my
member
is
arguing
that
a
caucus
rig
an
election
carried
on
under
the
proportional
representation
system
or
that
it
can
not
at
the
first
blush
it
seems
to
read
as
if
he
intended
the
former
but
be
careful
did
he
let
me
suggest
that
in
that
last
sentence
he
really
expresses
the
opinion
that
it
can
not
it
can
be
read
either
way
electors
under
modern
conditions
are
not
going
to
obey
the
orders
of
even
the
most
drastic
caucus
whatever
a
drastic
caucus
may
be
why
should
they
in
the
birmingham
instance
it
was
only
a
section
of
the
majority
voting
by
wards
in
an
election
on
purely
party
lines
which
obeyed
in
order
to
keep
out
the
minority
party
candidate
i
think
myself
that
my
mind
waggled
perhaps
his
real
thoughts
shone
out
through
an
argument
not
intended
to
betray
them
what
he
did
say
as
much
as
he
said
anything
was
that
under
proportional
representation
elections
are
going
to
be
very
troublesome
and
difficult
for
party
candidates
if
that
was
his
intention
then
after
all
i
forgive
him
much
i
think
that
and
more
than
that
i
think
that
they
are
going
to
make
party
candidates
who
are
merely
party
candidates
impossible
that
is
exactly
what
we
reformers
are
after
then
i
shall
get
a
representative
more
to
my
taste
than
burdett
coutts
but
let
me
turn
now
to
the
views
of
other
people
representatives
perhaps
the
most
damning
thing
ever
said
against
the
present
system
damning
because
of
its
empty
absurdity
was
uttered
by
sir
thomas
whittaker
he
was
making
the
usual
exaggerations
of
the
supposed
difficulties
of
the
method
he
said
english
people
did
like
such
complications
they
like
a
straight
fight
between
two
men
think
of
it
a
straight
fight
for
more
than
a
i
have
been
a
voter
usually
with
votes
in
two
or
three
constituencies
and
never
in
all
that
long
political
life
have
i
seen
a
single
straight
fight
in
an
election
but
only
the
dismallest
sham
fights
it
is
possible
to
conceive
thrice
only
in
all
that
time
have
i
cast
a
vote
for
a
man
whom
i
respected
on
all
other
occasions
the
election
that
mocked
my
citizenship
was
either
an
arranged
for
one
party
or
the
other
or
i
had
a
choice
between
two
unknown
persons
mysteriously
selected
as
candidates
by
obscure
busy
people
with
local
interests
in
the
constituency
every
intelligent
person
knows
that
this
is
the
usual
experience
of
a
free
and
independent
voter
in
england
the
fight
of
an
ordinary
parliamentary
election
in
england
is
about
as
straight
as
the
business
of
a
thimble
rigger
and
consider
just
what
these
complications
are
of
which
the
opponents
of
proportional
representation
chant
so
loudly
in
the
sham
election
of
which
the
politicians
claim
gives
them
a
mandate
to
muddle
up
our
affairs
the
voter
puts
a
x
against
the
name
of
the
least
detestable
of
the
two
candidates
that
are
thrust
upon
him
under
the
proportional
representation
method
there
will
be
a
larger
constituency
a
larger
list
of
candidates
and
a
larger
number
of
people
to
be
elected
and
he
will
put
i
against
the
name
of
the
man
he
most
wants
to
be
elected
against
his
second
choice
and
if
he
likes
he
may
indulge
in
marking
a
third
or
even
a
further
choice
he
may
if
he
thinks
fit
number
off
the
whole
list
of
candidates
that
is
all
he
will
have
to
do
that
is
the
stupendous
intricacy
of
the
method
that
flattens
out
the
minds
of
lord
harcourt
and
sir
thomas
whittaker
and
as
for
the
working
of
it
if
you
must
go
into
that
all
that
happens
is
that
if
your
first
choice
gets
more
votes
than
he
needs
for
his
return
he
takes
only
the
fraction
of
your
vote
that
he
requires
and
the
rest
of
the
vote
goes
on
to
your
number
if
is
in
need
of
all
of
it
the
rest
goes
on
to
and
so
on
that
is
the
profound
mathematical
mystery
that
is
the
riddle
beyond
the
wit
of
westminster
which
overpowers
these
fine
intelligences
and
sets
them
babbling
of
senior
wranglers
each
time
there
is
a
debate
on
this
question
in
the
house
member
after
member
hostile
to
the
proposal
will
play
the
ignorant
fool
and
pretend
to
be
confused
himself
and
will
try
to
confuse
others
by
deliberately
clumsy
statements
of
these
most
elementary
ideas
surely
if
there
were
no
other
argument
for
a
change
of
type
in
the
house
these
poor
knitted
brows
these
public
perspirations
of
the
gentry
who
can
not
understand
should
suffice
but
let
us
be
just
it
is
not
all
pretence
the
inability
of
austen
chamberlain
to
grasp
the
simple
facts
before
him
was
undoubtedly
genuine
he
followed
burdett
coutts
in
support
of
burdett
coutts
with
the
most
christian
disregard
of
the
nasty
things
burdett
coutts
had
seemed
to
be
saying
about
the
birmingham
caucus
from
which
he
sprang
he
had
a
childish
story
to
tell
of
how
voters
would
not
give
their
first
votes
to
their
real
preferences
because
they
would
assume
he
would
get
in
in
any
case
god
knows
why
of
course
on
the
assumption
that
the
voter
behaves
like
an
idiot
anything
is
possible
and
never
apparently
having
heard
of
fractions
this
great
birmingham
leader
was
unable
to
understand
that
a
voter
who
puts
against
a
candidate
name
votes
for
that
candidate
anyhow
he
could
not
imagine
any
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
voter
that
no
was
his
man
a
vote
is
a
vote
to
this
simple
rather
than
lucid
mind
a
thing
one
and
indivisible
read
this
birmingham
he
said
referring
to
a
schedule
under
consideration
is
to
be
cut
into
three
constituencies
of
four
members
each
i
am
to
have
a
constituency
of
electors
i
suppose
how
many
thousand
inhabitants
i
do
not
know
effort
will
be
made
to
prevent
any
of
those
electors
knowing
in
fact
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
of
them
to
know
whether
they
voted
for
me
or
not
or
at
any
rate
whether
they
effectively
voted
for
me
or
not
or
whether
the
vote
which
they
wished
to
give
to
me
was
really
diverted
to
somebody
only
in
a
house
of
habitually
inattentive
men
could
any
one
talk
such
nonsense
without
reproof
but
i
look
in
vain
through
hansard
record
of
this
debate
for
a
single
contemptuous
reference
to
obtuseness
and
the
rest
of
his
speech
was
a
lamentable
account
of
the
time
and
trouble
he
would
have
to
spend
upon
his
constituents
if
the
new
method
came
in
he
was
the
perfect
figure
of
the
parochially
important
person
in
a
state
of
defensive
excitement
no
doubt
his
speech
appealed
to
many
in
the
house
of
course
lord
harcourt
was
quite
right
in
saying
that
the
character
of
the
average
house
of
commons
member
will
be
changed
by
proportional
representation
it
will
it
will
make
the
election
of
obscure
and
unknown
men
of
candidates
who
work
a
constituency
as
a
hawker
works
a
village
of
local
pomposities
and
leaders
almost
impossible
it
will
replace
such
candidates
by
better
known
and
more
widely
known
men
it
will
make
the
house
of
commons
so
much
the
more
a
real
gathering
of
the
nation
so
much
the
more
a
house
of
representative
men
lord
harcourt
faddists
and
mugwumps
and
it
is
perfectly
true
as
ramsay
macdonald
also
an
opponent
declares
that
proportional
representation
means
constituencies
so
big
that
it
will
be
impossible
for
a
poor
man
to
cultivate
and
work
them
that
is
unquestionable
but
mark
another
point
it
will
also
make
it
useless
as
chamberlain
has
testified
for
rich
men
to
cultivate
and
work
them
all
this
cultivating
and
working
all
this
going
about
and
making
things
right
with
this
little
jobber
here
that
contractor
there
all
the
squaring
of
small
political
clubs
and
organizations
all
the
subscription
blackmail
and
charity
bribery
that
now
makes
a
parliamentary
candidature
so
utterly
rotten
an
influence
upon
public
life
will
be
killed
dead
by
proportional
representation
you
can
not
job
men
into
parliament
by
proportional
representation
proportional
representation
lets
in
the
outsider
it
lets
in
the
common
unassigned
voter
who
is
in
the
local
clique
that
is
the
clue
to
nearly
all
this
opposition
of
the
politicians
it
makes
democracy
possible
for
the
first
time
in
modern
history
and
that
poor
man
of
ramsay
imagination
instead
of
cadging
about
a
constituency
in
order
to
start
politician
will
have
to
make
good
in
some
more
useful
way
as
a
leader
of
the
workers
in
their
practical
affairs
for
example
before
people
will
hear
of
him
and
begin
to
believe
in
him
the
opposition
to
proportional
representation
of
sidney
webb
and
his
little
circle
is
a
trifle
more
scientific
in
tone
than
these
naive
objections
of
the
common
run
of
antagonist
but
underlying
it
is
the
same
passionate
desire
to
keep
politics
a
close
game
for
the
politician
and
to
bar
out
the
politically
unspecialized
man
there
is
more
conceit
and
less
jobbery
behind
the
criticisms
of
this
type
of
mind
it
is
an
opposition
based
on
the
idea
that
the
common
man
is
a
fool
who
does
not
know
what
is
good
for
him
so
he
has
to
be
stampeded
politics
according
to
this
school
is
a
sort
of
the
webbites
do
not
deny
the
broad
facts
of
the
case
our
present
electoral
system
with
our
big
modern
constituencies
of
thousands
of
voters
leads
to
huge
turnovers
of
political
power
with
a
relatively
small
shifting
of
public
opinion
it
makes
a
mock
of
public
opinion
by
caricature
and
parliament
becomes
the
distorting
mirror
of
the
nation
under
some
loud
false
issue
a
few
score
of
thousands
of
votes
turn
over
and
in
goes
this
party
or
that
with
a
big
sham
majority
this
the
webbites
admit
but
they
applaud
it
it
gives
us
they
say
a
strong
government
public
opinion
the
intelligent
man
outside
the
house
is
ruled
out
of
the
game
he
has
no
power
of
intervention
at
all
the
artful
little
fabian
politicians
rub
their
hands
and
say
we
can
get
to
work
with
the
wires
no
one
can
stop
us
and
when
the
public
complains
of
the
results
there
is
always
the
repartee
elected
them
but
the
fabian
psychology
is
the
psychology
of
a
very
small
group
of
pedants
who
believe
that
fair
ends
may
be
reached
by
foul
means
it
is
much
easier
and
more
natural
to
serve
foul
ends
by
foul
means
in
practice
it
is
not
tricky
benevolence
but
tricky
bargaining
among
the
interests
that
will
secure
control
of
the
political
wires
that
is
a
bad
enough
state
of
affairs
in
ordinary
times
but
in
times
of
tragic
necessity
like
the
present
men
will
not
be
mocked
in
this
way
life
is
going
to
be
very
intense
in
the
years
ahead
of
us
if
we
go
right
on
to
another
caricature
parliament
with
perhaps
half
a
hundred
leading
men
in
it
and
the
rest
hacks
and
nobodies
the
baffled
and
discontented
outsiders
in
the
streets
may
presently
be
driven
to
rioting
and
the
throwing
of
bombs
unless
indeed
the
insurrection
of
the
outsiders
takes
a
still
graver
form
and
the
press
which
has
ceased
entirely
to
be
a
party
press
in
great
britain
helps
some
adventurous
prime
minister
to
flout
and
set
aside
the
lower
house
altogether
there
is
neither
much
moral
nor
much
physical
force
behind
the
house
of
commons
at
the
present
time
the
argument
of
the
fabian
opponents
to
proportional
representation
is
frankly
that
the
strongest
government
is
got
in
a
house
of
half
a
hundred
or
fewer
leading
men
with
the
rest
of
the
parliament
driven
sheep
but
the
whole
mischief
of
the
present
system
is
that
the
obscure
members
of
parliament
are
not
sheep
they
are
a
crowd
of
men
just
as
greedy
and
eager
and
as
any
of
us
they
vote
straight
indeed
on
all
the
main
party
questions
they
obey
their
whips
like
sheep
then
but
there
is
a
great
bulk
of
business
in
parliament
outside
the
main
party
questions
and
obedience
is
not
without
its
price
these
are
matters
vitally
affecting
our
railways
and
ships
and
communications
generally
the
food
and
health
of
the
people
armaments
every
sort
of
employment
the
appointment
of
public
servants
the
everyday
texture
of
all
our
lives
then
the
nobody
becomes
somebody
the
party
hack
gets
busy
the
rat
is
in
the
granary
in
these
recent
debates
in
the
house
of
commons
one
can
see
every
stock
trick
of
the
in
operation
particularly
we
have
the
old
dodge
of
the
man
who
is
in
theory
quite
in
sympathy
with
proportional
representation
but
it
is
he
declares
regretfully
too
late
it
will
cause
delay
difficult
to
make
arrangements
later
on
perhaps
and
so
on
it
is
never
too
late
for
a
vital
issue
upon
the
speedy
adoption
of
proportional
representation
depends
as
balfour
made
plain
in
an
admirable
speech
whether
the
great
occasions
of
the
peace
and
after
the
peace
are
to
be
handled
by
a
grand
council
of
all
that
is
best
and
most
leaderlike
in
the
nation
or
whether
they
are
to
be
left
to
a
few
leaders
apparently
leading
but
really
profoundly
swayed
by
the
obscure
crowd
of
politicians
and
jobbers
behind
them
are
the
politicians
to
hamper
and
stifle
us
in
this
supreme
crisis
of
our
national
destinies
or
are
we
british
peoples
to
have
a
real
control
of
our
own
affairs
in
this
momentous
time
are
men
of
light
and
purpose
to
have
a
voice
in
public
affairs
or
not
proportional
representation
is
supremely
a
test
question
it
is
a
question
that
no
adverse
decision
in
the
house
of
commons
can
stifle
there
are
too
many
people
now
who
grasp
its
importance
and
significance
every
one
who
sets
a
proper
value
upon
purity
in
public
life
and
the
vitality
of
democratic
institutions
will
i
am
convinced
vote
and
continue
to
vote
across
every
other
question
against
the
antiquated
foul
and
fraudulent
electoral
methods
that
have
hitherto
robbed
democracy
of
of
its
efficiency
xi
the
study
and
propaganda
of
democracy
in
the
preceding
chapter
i
have
dealt
with
the
discussion
of
proportional
representation
in
the
british
house
of
commons
in
order
to
illustrate
the
intellectual
squalor
amidst
which
public
affairs
have
to
be
handled
at
the
present
time
even
in
a
country
professedly
democratic
i
have
taken
this
one
discussion
as
a
sample
to
illustrate
the
present
imperfection
of
our
democratic
instrument
all
over
the
world
in
every
country
great
multitudes
of
intelligent
and
serious
people
are
now
inspired
by
the
idea
of
a
new
order
of
things
in
the
world
of
a
establishment
of
peace
and
mutual
aid
between
nation
and
nation
and
man
and
man
but
chiefly
because
of
the
elementary
crudity
of
existing
electoral
methods
hardly
anywhere
at
present
except
at
washington
do
these
great
ideas
and
this
will
find
expression
amidst
the
other
politicians
and
statesmen
of
the
world
president
wilson
towers
up
with
an
effect
almost
divine
but
it
is
no
ingratitude
to
him
to
say
that
he
is
not
nearly
so
exceptional
a
being
among
educated
men
as
he
is
among
the
official
leaders
of
mankind
everywhere
now
one
may
find
something
of
the
wilson
purpose
and
intelligence
but
nearly
everywhere
it
is
silenced
or
muffled
or
made
ineffective
by
the
political
advantage
of
privileged
or
of
violent
and
adventurous
inferior
men
he
is
one
of
us
but
it
is
his
good
fortune
to
have
got
his
head
out
of
the
sack
that
is
about
the
heads
of
most
of
us
in
the
official
world
in
the
world
of
rulers
and
representatives
and
statesmen
he
almost
alone
speaks
for
the
modern
intelligence
this
general
stifling
of
the
better
intelligence
of
the
world
and
its
possible
release
to
expression
and
power
seems
to
me
to
be
the
fundamental
issue
underlying
all
the
present
troubles
of
mankind
we
can
not
get
on
while
everywhere
fools
and
vulgarians
hold
the
levers
that
can
kill
imprison
silence
and
starve
men
we
can
not
get
on
with
false
government
and
we
can
not
get
on
with
mob
government
we
must
have
right
government
the
intellectual
people
of
the
world
have
a
duty
of
they
have
too
long
neglected
the
modernization
of
political
institutions
the
study
of
these
institutions
until
we
have
worked
out
and
achieved
the
very
best
and
most
efficient
methods
whereby
the
whole
community
of
mankind
may
work
together
under
the
direction
of
its
chosen
intelligences
is
the
common
duty
of
every
one
who
has
a
brain
for
the
service
and
before
everything
else
we
have
to
realize
this
crudity
and
imperfection
in
what
we
call
democracy
at
the
present
time
democracy
is
still
chiefly
an
aspiration
it
is
a
spirit
it
is
an
idea
for
the
most
part
its
methods
are
still
to
seek
and
still
more
is
this
league
of
free
nations
as
yet
but
an
aspiration
let
us
not
underrate
the
task
before
us
only
the
disinterested
devotion
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
active
brains
in
school
in
pulpit
in
book
and
press
and
assembly
can
ever
bring
these
redeeming
conceptions
down
to
the
solid
earth
to
rule
all
round
the
world
there
is
this
same
obscuration
of
the
real
intelligence
of
men
in
germany
human
good
will
and
every
fine
mind
are
subordinated
to
political
forms
that
have
for
a
mouthpiece
a
chancellor
with
his
brains
manifestly
addled
by
the
theories
of
and
the
bismarckian
tradition
and
for
a
figurehead
a
mad
kaiser
nevertheless
there
comes
even
from
germany
muffled
cries
for
a
new
age
a
grinning
figure
like
a
bloodstained
punch
is
all
that
speaks
for
the
best
brains
in
bulgaria
yes
we
western
allies
know
all
that
by
heart
but
after
all
the
immediate
question
for
each
one
of
us
is
speaks
for
me
so
far
as
official
political
forms
go
i
myself
am
as
ineffective
as
any
german
or
bulgarian
could
possibly
be
i
am
more
ineffective
than
a
galician
pole
or
a
bohemian
who
votes
for
his
nationalist
representative
politically
i
am
a
negligible
item
in
the
constituency
of
this
burdett
coutts
into
whose
brain
we
have
been
peeping
politically
i
am
less
than
a
waistcoat
button
on
that
quaint
figure
and
that
is
all
i
am
except
that
i
revolt
i
have
written
of
it
so
far
as
if
it
were
just
a
joke
but
indeed
bad
and
foolish
political
institutions
can
not
be
a
joke
sooner
or
later
they
prove
themselves
to
be
tragedy
this
war
is
that
it
is
lazy
tolerant
sense
of
humour
wading
out
now
into
the
lakes
of
blood
it
refused
to
foresee
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
anywhere
the
nationalisms
the
suspicions
and
hatreds
the
cants
and
policies
and
dead
phrases
that
sway
men
represent
the
current
intelligence
of
mankind
they
are
merely
the
evidences
of
its
disorganization
even
now
we
we
could
do
far
better
give
mankind
but
a
generation
or
so
of
peace
and
right
education
and
this
world
could
mock
at
the
poor
imaginations
that
conceived
a
millennium
but
we
have
to
get
intelligences
together
we
have
to
canalize
thought
before
it
can
work
and
produce
its
due
effects
to
that
end
i
suppose
there
has
been
a
vast
amount
of
mental
activity
among
us
political
negligibles
for
my
own
part
i
have
thought
of
the
idea
of
god
as
the
banner
of
human
unity
and
justice
and
i
have
made
some
tentatives
in
that
direction
but
men
i
perceive
have
argued
themselves
mean
and
petty
about
religion
at
the
word
god
passions
bristle
the
word
god
does
not
unite
men
it
angers
them
but
i
doubt
if
god
cares
greatly
whether
we
call
him
god
or
no
his
service
is
the
service
of
man
this
double
idea
of
the
league
of
free
nations
linked
with
the
idea
of
democracy
as
universal
justice
is
free
from
the
jealousy
of
the
theologians
and
great
enough
for
men
to
unite
upon
everywhere
i
know
how
warily
one
must
reckon
with
the
spite
of
the
priest
but
surely
these
ideas
may
call
upon
the
teachers
of
all
the
great
world
religions
for
their
support
the
world
is
full
now
of
confused
propaganda
propaganda
of
national
ideas
of
traditions
of
hate
of
sentimental
and
degrading
loyalties
of
every
sort
of
error
that
divides
and
tortures
and
slays
mankind
all
human
institutions
are
made
of
propaganda
are
sustained
by
propaganda
and
perish
when
it
ceases
they
must
be
continually
explained
and
to
the
young
and
the
negligent
and
for
this
new
world
of
democracy
and
the
league
of
free
nations
to
which
all
reasonable
men
are
looking
there
must
needs
be
the
greatest
of
all
propagandas
for
that
cause
every
one
must
become
a
teacher
and
a
missionary
persuade
to
it
and
make
the
idea
of
it
and
the
necessity
for
it
plain
that
is
the
duty
of
every
school
teacher
every
tutor
every
religious
teacher
every
writer
every
lecturer
every
parent
every
trusted
friend
throughout
the
world
for
it
too
every
one
must
become
a
student
must
go
on
with
the
task
of
making
vague
intentions
into
definite
intentions
of
analyzing
and
destroying
obstacles
of
mastering
the
ten
thousand
difficulties
of
detail
i
am
a
man
who
looks
now
towards
the
end
of
life
years
have
i
scratched
off
from
my
calendar
another
slips
by
and
i
can
not
tell
how
many
more
of
the
sparse
remainder
of
possible
years
are
really
mine
i
live
in
days
of
hardship
and
privation
when
it
seems
more
natural
to
feel
ill
than
well
without
holidays
or
rest
or
peace
friends
and
the
sons
of
my
friends
have
been
killed
death
seems
to
be
feeling
always
now
for
those
i
most
love
the
newspapers
that
come
in
to
my
house
tell
mostly
of
blood
and
disaster
of
drownings
and
slaughterings
of
cruelties
and
base
intrigues
yet
never
have
i
been
so
sure
that
there
is
a
divinity
in
man
and
that
a
great
order
of
human
life
a
reign
of
justice
and
happiness
of
plenty
power
hope
and
gigantic
creative
effort
lies
close
at
hand
even
now
we
have
the
science
and
the
ability
available
for
a
universal
welfare
though
it
is
scattered
about
the
world
like
a
handful
of
money
dropped
by
a
child
even
now
there
exists
all
the
knowledge
that
is
needed
to
make
mankind
universally
free
and
human
life
sweet
and
noble
we
need
but
the
faith
for
it
and
it
is
at
hand
we
need
but
the
courage
to
lay
our
hands
upon
it
and
in
a
little
space
of
years
it
can
be
ours
the
end
