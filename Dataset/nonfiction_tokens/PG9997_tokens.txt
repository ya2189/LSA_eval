the

west
by
francis
parkman
to
the
class
of
harvard
college
this
book
is
cordially
dedicated
by
one
of
their
number
preface
the
discovery
of
the
great
west
or
the
valleys
of
the
mississippi
and
the
lakes
is
a
portion
of
our
history
hitherto
very
obscure
those
magnificent
regions
were
revealed
to
the
world
through
a
series
of
daring
enterprises
of
which
the
motives
and
even
the
incidents
have
been
but
partially
and
superficially
known
the
chief
actor
in
them
wrote
much
but
printed
nothing
and
the
published
writings
of
his
associates
stand
wofully
in
need
of
interpretation
from
the
unpublished
documents
which
exist
but
which
have
not
heretofore
been
used
as
material
for
history
this
volume
attempts
to
supply
the
defect
of
the
large
amount
of
wholly
new
material
employed
in
it
by
far
the
greater
part
is
drawn
from
the
various
public
archives
of
france
and
the
rest
from
private
sources
the
discovery
of
many
of
these
documents
is
due
to
the
indefatigable
research
of
pierre
margry
assistant
custodian
of
the
archives
of
the
marine
and
colonies
at
paris
whose
labors
as
an
investigator
of
the
maritime
and
colonial
history
of
france
can
be
appreciated
only
by
those
who
have
seen
their
results
in
the
department
of
american
colonial
history
these
results
have
been
invaluable
for
besides
several
private
collections
made
by
him
he
rendered
important
service
in
the
collection
of
the
french
portion
of
the
brodhead
documents
selected
and
arranged
the
two
great
series
of
colonial
papers
ordered
by
the
canadian
government
and
prepared
with
vast
labor
analytical
indexes
of
these
and
of
supplementary
documents
in
the
french
archives
as
well
as
a
copious
index
of
the
mass
of
papers
relating
to
louisiana
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
valuable
publications
on
the
maritime
history
of
france
which
have
appeared
from
his
pen
are
an
earnest
of
more
extended
contributions
in
future
the
late
president
sparks
some
time
after
the
publication
of
his
life
of
la
salle
caused
a
collection
to
be
made
of
documents
relating
to
that
explorer
with
the
intention
of
incorporating
them
in
a
future
edition
this
intention
was
never
carried
into
effect
and
the
documents
were
never
used
with
the
liberality
which
always
distinguished
him
he
placed
them
at
my
disposal
and
this
privilege
has
been
kindly
continued
by
sparks
abbé

the
learned
author

introduction
the
spaniards
discovered
the
mississippi
de
soto
was
buried
beneath
its
waters
and
it
was
down
its
muddy
current
that
his
followers
fled
from
the
eldorado
of
their
dreams
transformed
to
a
dismal
wilderness
of
misery
and
death
the
discovery
was
never
used
and
was
forgotten
on
early
spanish
maps
the
mississippi
is
often
indistinguishable
from
other
affluents
of
the
gulf
a
century
passed
after
de
soto
journeyings
in
the
south
before
a
french
explorer
reached
a
northern
tributary
of
the
great
river
this
was
jean
nicollet
interpreter
at
three
rivers
on
the
lawrence
he
had
been
some
twenty
years
in
canada
had
lived
among
the
savage
algonquins
of
allumette
island
and
spent
eight
or
nine
years
among
the
nipissings
on
the
lake
which
bears
their
name
here
he
became
an
indian
in
all
his
habits
but
remained
nevertheless
a
zealous
catholic
and
returned
to
civilization
at
last
because
he
could
not
live
without
the
sacraments
strange
stories
were
current
among
the
nipissings
of
a
people
without
hair
and
without
beards
who
came
from
the
west
to
trade
with
a
tribe
beyond
the
great
lakes
who
could
doubt
that
these
strangers
were
chinese
or
japanese
such
tales
may
well
have
excited
curiosity
and
when
in
or
before
the
year
he
was
sent
as
an
ambassador
to
the
tribe
in
question
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
on
arriving
he
had
found
a
party
of
mandarins
among
them
possibly
it
was
with
a
view
to
such
a
contingency
that
he
provided
himself
as
a
dress
of
ceremony
with
a
robe
of
chinese
damask
embroidered
with
birds
and
flowers
the
tribe
to
which
he
was
sent
was
that
of
the
winnebagoes
living
near
the
head
of
the
green
bay
of
lake
michigan
they
had
come
to
blows
with
the
hurons
allies
of
the
french
and
nicollet
was
charged
to
negotiate
a
peace
when
he
approached
the
winnebago
town
he
sent
one
of
his
indian
attendants
to
announce
his
coming
put
on
his
robe
of
damask
and
advanced
to
meet
the
expectant
crowd
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
the
squaws
and
children
fled
screaming
that
it
was
a
manito
or
spirit
armed
with
thunder
and
lightning
but
the
chiefs
and
warriors
regaled
him
with
so
bountiful
a
hospitality
that
a
hundred
and
twenty
beavers
were
devoured
at
a
single
feast
from
the
winnebagoes
he
passed
westward
ascended
fox
river
crossed
to
the
wisconsin
and
descended
it
so
far
that
as
he
reported
on
his
return
in
three
days
more
he
would
have
reached
the
sea
the
truth
seems
to
be
that
he
mistook
the
meaning
of
his
indian
guides
and
that
the
great
water
to
which
he
was
so
near
was
not
the
sea
but
the
mississippi
it
has
been
affirmed
that
one
colonel
wood
of
virginia
reached
a
branch
of
the
mississippi
as
early
as
the
year
and
that
about
a
certain
captain
bolton
penetrated
to
the
river
itself
neither
statement
is
improbable
but
neither
is
sustained
by
sufficient
evidence

la

was
the
name
of
an

near

belonging
to
the
caveliers
the
wealthy
french
burghers

distinguished
the
various

from

son

which
he
made
famous
his
father
jean
and
his
uncle
henri
were
wealthy
merchants
living
more
like
nobles
than
like
burghers
and
the
boy
received
an
education
answering
to
the
marked
traits
of
intellect
and
character
which
he
soon
began
to
display
he
showed
an
inclination
for
the
exact
sciences
and
especially
for
the
mathematics
in
which
he
made
great
proficiency
at
an
early
age
it
is
said
he
became
connected
with
the
jesuits
and
though
doubt
has
been
expressed
of
the
statement
it
is
probably
true
footnote
margry
after
investigations
at
rouen
is
satisfied
of
its
général
de

family
papers
of
the
caveliers
examined
by
the
abbé
faillon
and
copies
of
some
of
which
he
has
sent
to
me
lead
to
the
same
conclusion
we
shall
find
several
allusions
hereafter
to
la
salle
having
in
his
youth
taught
in
a
school
which
in
his
position
could
only
have
been
in
connection
with
some
religious
community
the
doubts
alluded
to
have
proceeded
from
the
failure
of
father
felix
martin
to
find
the
name
of
on
the
list
of
novices
if
he
had
looked
for
the
name
of
he
would
probably
have
found
it
the
companion
of
la
salle
hennepin
is
very
explicit
with
regard
to
this
connection
with
the
jesuits
a
point
on
which
he
had
no
motive
for
falsehood
la
salle
was
always
an
earnest
catholic
and
yet
judging
by
the
qualities
which
his
after
life
evinced
he
was
not
very
liable
to
religious
enthusiasm
it
is
nevertheless
clear
that
the
society
of
jesus
may
have
had
a
powerful
attraction
for
his
youthful
imagination
this
great
organization
so
complicated
yet
so
harmonious
a
mighty
machine
moved
from
the
centre
by
a
single
hand
was
an
image
of
regulated
power
full
of
fascination
for
a
mind
like
his
but
if
it
was
likely
that
he
would
be
drawn
into
it
it
was
no
less
likely
that
he
would
soon
wish
to
escape
to
find
himself
not
at
the
centre
of
power
but
at
the
circumference
not
the
mover
but
the
moved
the
passive
instrument
of
another
will
taught
to
walk
in
prescribed
paths
to
renounce
his
individuality
and
become
a
component
atom
of
a
vast
whole
would
have
been
intolerable
to
him
nature
had
shaped
him
for
other
uses
than
to
teach
a
class
of
boys
on
the
benches
of
a
jesuit
school
nor
on
his
part
was
he
likely
to
please
his
directors
for
and
as
he
was
he
was
far
too
intractable
a
subject
to
serve
their
turn
a
youth
whose
calm
exterior
hid
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
pride
whose
inflexible
purposes
nursed
in
secret
the
confessional
and
the
manifestation
of
conscience
could
hardly
drag
to
the
light
whose
strong
personality
would
not
yield
to
the
shaping
hand
and
who
by
a
necessity
of
his
nature
could
obey
no
initiative
but
his
own
was
not
after
the
model
that
loyola
had
commended
to
his
followers
la
salle
left
the
jesuits
parting
with
them
it
is
said
on
good
terms
and
with
a
reputation
of
excellent
acquirements
and
unimpeachable
morals
this
last
is
very
credible
the
cravings
of
a
deep
ambition
the
hunger
of
an
insatiable
intellect
the
intense
longing
for
action
and
achievement
subdued
in
him
all
other
passions
and
in
his
faults
the
love
of
pleasure
had
no
part
he
had

elder
brother

kind
of
iroquois
colony
at
the
head
of
lake
ontario
offered
to
conduct
them
thither
assuring
them
that
they
would
find
what
they
sought
they
left
the
seneca
town
coasted
the
south
shore
of
the
lake
passed
the
mouth
of
the
niagara
where
they
heard
the
distant
roar
of
the
cataract
and
five
days
after
reached
ganastogué
the
inhabitants
proved
friendly
and
la
salle
received
the
welcome
present
of
a
shawnee
prisoner
who
told
them
that
the
ohio
could
he
reached
in
six
weeks
and
that
he
would
guide
them
to
it
delighted
at
this
good
fortune
they
were
about
to
set
out
when
they
heard
to
their
astonishment
of
the
arrival
of
two
other
frenchmen
at
a
neighboring
village
one
of
the
strangers
proved
to
be
a
man
destined
to
hold
a
conspicuous
place
in
the
history
of
western
discovery
this
was
louis
joliet
a
young
man
of
about
the
age
of
la
salle
like
him
he
had
studied
for
the
priesthood
but
the
world
and
the
wilderness
had
conquered
his
early
inclinations
and
changed
him
to
an
active
and
adventurous
talon
had
sent
him
to
discover
and
explore
the
of
lake
superior
he
had
failed
in
the
attempt
and
was
now
returning
his
indian
guide
afraid
of
passing
the
niagara
portage
lest
he
should
meet
enemies
had
led
him
from
lake
erie
by
way
of
grand
river
towards
the
head
of
lake
ontario
and
thus
it
was
that
he
met
la
salle
and
the
sulpitians
this
meeting
caused
a
change
of
plan
joliet
showed
the
priests
a
map
which
he
had
made
of
such
parts
of
the
upper
lakes
as
he
had
visited
and
gave
them
a
copy
of
it
telling
them
at
the
same
time
of
the
pottawattamies
and
other
tribes
of
that
region
in
grievous
need
of
spiritual
succor
the
result
was
a
determination
on
their
part
to
follow
the
route
which
he
suggested
notwithstanding
the
remonstrances
of
la
salle
who
in
vain
reminded
them
that
the
jesuits
had
the
field
and
would
regard
them
as
intruders
they
resolved
that
the
pottawattamies
should
no
longer
sit
in
darkness
while
as
for
the
mississippi
it
could
be
reached
as
they
conceived
with
less
risk
by
this
northern
route
than
by
that
of
the
south
since
reaching
the
head
of
lake
ontario
la
salle
had
been
attacked
by
a
violent
fever
from
which
he
was
not
yet
recovered
he
now
told
his
two
colleagues
that
he
was
in
no
condition
to
go
forward
and
should
be
forced
to
part
with
them
the
staple
of
la
salle
character
as
his
life
will
attest
was
an
invincible
determination
of
purpose
which
set
at
naught
all
risks
and
all
sufferings
he
had
cast
himself
with
all
his
resources
into
this
enterprise
and
while
his
faculties
remained
he
was
not
a
man
to
recoil
from
it
on
the
other
hand
the
masculine
fibre
of
which
he
was
made
did
not
always
withhold
him
from
the
practice
of
the
arts
of
address
and
the
use
of
what
dollier
de
casson
styles
he
respected
the
priesthood
with
the
exception
it
seems
of
the
jesuits
and
he
was
under
obligations
to
the
sulpitians
of
montreal
hence
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
used
his
illness
as
a
pretext
for
escaping
from
their
company
without
ungraciousness
and
following
his
own
path
in
his
own
way
on
the
last
day
of
september
the
priests
made
an
altar
supported
by
the
paddles
of
the
canoes
laid
on
forked
sticks
dollier
said
mass
la
salle
and
his
followers
received
the
sacrament
as
did
also
those
of
his
late
colleagues
and
thus
they
parted
the
sulpitians
and
their
party
descending
the
grand
river
towards
lake
erie
while
la
salle
as
they
supposed
began
his
return
to
montreal
what
course
he
actually
took
we
shall
soon
inquire
and
meanwhile
for
a
few
moments
we
will
follow
the
priests
when
they
reached
lake
erie
they
saw
it
tossing
like
an
angry
ocean
under
a
wild
autumnal
sky
they
had
no
mind
to
tempt
the
dangerous
and
unknown
navigation
and
encamped
for
the
winter
in
the
forest
near
the
peninsula
called
the
long
point
here
they
gathered
a
good
store
of
chestnuts
plums
and
grapes
and
built
themselves
a
cabin
with
a
recess
at
the
end
for
an
altar
they
passed
the
winter
unmolested
shooting
game
in
abundance
and
saying
mass
three
times
a
week
early
in
spring
they
planted
a
large
cross
attached
to
it
the
arms
of
france
and
took
formal
possession
of
the
country
in
the
name
of
louis
xiv
this
done
they
resumed
their
voyage
and
after
many
troubles
landed
one
evening
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
on
or
near
point
pelée
towards
the
western
extremity
of
lake
erie
a
storm
rose
as
they
lay
asleep
and
swept
off
a
great
part
of
their
baggage
which
in
their
fatigue
they
had
left
at
the
edge
of
the
water
their
was
lost
with
the
rest
a
misfortune
which
they
ascribed
to
the
jealousy
and
malice
of
the
devil
debarred
henceforth
from
saying
mass
they
resolved
to
return
to
montreal
and
leave
the
pottawattamies
uninstructed
they
presently
entered
the
strait
by
which
lake
huron
joins
lake
erie
and
landing
near
where
detroit
now
stands
found
a
large
stone
somewhat
suggestive
of
the
human
figure
which
the
indians
had
bedaubed
with
paint
and
which
they
worshipped
as
a
manito
in
view
of
their
late
misfortune
this
device
of
the
excited
their
utmost
resentment
after
the
loss
of
our
writes
galinée
and
the
hunger
we
had
suffered
there
was
not
a
man
of
us
who
was
not
filled
with
hatred
against
this
false
deity
i
devoted
one
of
my
axes
to
breaking
him
in
pieces
and
then
having
fastened
our
canoes
side
by
side
we
carried
the
largest
piece
to
the
middle
of
the
river
and
threw
it
with
all
the
rest
into
the
water
that
he
might
never
be
heard
of
again
this
is
the
first
recorded
passage
of
white
men
through
the
strait
of
detroit
though
joliet
had
no
doubt
passed
this
way
on
his
return
from
the
upper
lakes
footnote
the
jesuits
and
on
their
way
to

followed
the
route

more
recently

long
closed
the
niagara
portage

the
two

took
this
course
with
the
intention
of
proceeding
to
the
saut
sainte

and
there
joining
the
ottawas
and
other
tribes
of
that
region
in
their
yearly
descent
to
montreal
they
issued
upon
lake
huron
followed
its
eastern
shores
till
they
reached
the
georgian
bay
near
the
head

the
jesuits
had
established

destroyed
twenty

before

and
ignoring

slighting
the

of
the

missionaries
held
their
way
northward
along
the
rocky
archipelago
that
edged
those
lonely
coasts
they
passed
the
manatoulins
and
ascending
the
strait
by
which
lake
superior
discharges
its
waters
arrived
on
the
of
may
at
ste

du

here
they
found
the
two
jesuits
dablon
and
marquette
in
a
square
fort
of
cedar
pickets
built
by
their
men
within
the
past
year
and
enclosing
a
chapel

a
house
near
by
they
had
cleared
a
large
tract
of
land
and
sown
it
with
wheat

were
graciously
received
and
invited
to

in

but
they
very
soon
found
la
prediction
made
good
and
saw
that
the
jesuit
fathers
wanted
no
help
from
sulpice
galinée
on
his
part
takes
occasion
to
remark
that
though
the
jesuits
had
baptized
a
few
indians
at
the
saut
not
one
of
them
was
a
good
enough
christian
to
receive
the
eucharist
and
he
intimates
that
the
case
by
their
own
showing
was
still
worse
at
their
mission
of
esprit
the
two
sulpitians
did
not
care
to
prolong
their
stay
and
three
days
after
their
arrival
they
left
the
saut
not
as
they
expected
with
the
indians
but
with
a
french
guide
furnished
by
the
jesuits
ascending
french
river
to
lake
nipissing
they
crossed
to
the
waters
of
the
ottawa
and
descended
to
montreal
which
they
reached
on
the
eighteenth
of
june
they
had
made
no
discoveries
and
no
converts
but
galinée
after
his
arrival
made
the
earliest
map
of
the
upper
lakes
known
to
exist
footnote
galinée
appears
to
have
made
use
of
the
map
given
him
by
joliet
he
says
in
the
narrative
of
his
journey
that
he
has
laid
down
on
his
own
map
nothing
but
what
he
had
himself
seen
but
this
is
disproved
by
the
map
itself
thus
he
represents
with
minuteness
the
northern
coast
as
far
west
as
the
islands
at
the
mouth
of
green
bay
but
that
he
never
went
so
far
is
evident
not
only
from
his
own
journal
but
from
the
fact
that
he
was
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
the
straits
of
michillimackinac
and
the
peninsula
of
michigan
lakes
huron
and
michigan
being
by

only
to
find
ourselves
involved
in
mist
and
obscurity
what
did
he
do
after
he
left
the
two
priests
unfortunately
a
definite
answer
is
not
possible
and
the
next
two
years
of
his
life
remain
in
some
measure
an
enigma
that
he
was
busied
in
active
exploration
and
that
he
made
important
discoveries
is
certain
but
the
extent
and
character
of
these
discoveries
remain
wrapped
in
doubt
he
is
known
to
have
kept
journals
and
made
maps
and
these
were
in
existence
and
in
possession
of
his
niece

time

them
the
abbé
faillon
affirms
that
some
of
la

men
refusing
to
follow
him
returned
to
la

and
that
the

then
received
its

himself
by

that
he
had
ten

twelve
conversations
with

he

come
with
a

to
the

the

himself
had
never
been
in
america
and
was
ignorant
of
its
geography
hence
blunders
on
his
part
might
reasonably
be
expected
his
statements
however
are
in
some
measure
intelligible
and
the
following
is
the
substance
of
them
after
leaving
the
priests
la
salle
went
to
onondaga
where
we
are
left
to
infer
that
he
succeeded
better
in
getting
a
guide
than
he
had
before
done
among
the
senecas
thence
he
made
his
way
to
a
point
six
or
seven
leagues
distant
from
lake
erie
where
he
reached
a
branch
of
the
ohio
and
descending
it
followed
the
river
as
far
as
the
rapids
at
louisville
or
as
has
been
maintained
beyond
its
confluence
with
the
mississippi
his
men
now
refused
to
go
farther
and
abandoned
him
escaping
to
the
english
and
the
dutch
whereupon
he
retraced
his
steps
alone

then
be

as
established

he
descended
it

himself

not
pretend
nor
is
there
reason
to
believe
that
he
did
so
with

to
his
alleged
voyage
down
the

the
case
is
different
here
he
is
reported
to
have
made
a
statement
which
admits
but
one
interpretation
that
of
the
discovery
by
him
of
the
mississippi
prior
to
its
discovery
by
joliet
and
marquette
this
statement
is
attributed
to
a
man
not
prone
to
vaunt
his
own
exploits
who
never
proclaimed
them
in
print
and
whose
testimony
even
in
his
own
case
must
therefore
have
weight
but
it
comes
to
us
through
the
medium
of
a
person
strongly
biased
in
favor
of
la
salle
and
against
marquette
and
the
jesuits
seven
years
had
passed
since
the
alleged
discovery
and
la
salle
had
not
before
laid
claim
to
it
although
it
was
matter
of
notoriety
that
during
five
years
it
had
been
claimed
by
joliet
and
that
his
claim
was
generally
admitted
the
correspondence
of
the
governor
and
the
intendant
is
silent
as
to
la
salle
having
penetrated
to
the
mississippi
though
the
attempt
was
made
under
the
auspices
of
the
latter
as

see
the
jesuits
in

america

had
devoted
themselves
in
the
fulness
of
faith
to
the
building
up
of
a
christian
and
jesuit
empire
on
the
conversion
of
the
great
stationary
tribes
of
the
lakes
and
of
these
none
remained
but
the
iroquois
the
destroyers
of
the
rest
among
whom
indeed
was
a
field
which
might
stimulate
their
zeal
by
an
abundant
promise
of
sufferings
and
martyrdoms
but
which
from
its
geographical
position
was
too
much
exposed
to
dutch
and
english
influence
to
promise
great
and
decisive
results
their
best
hopes
were
now
in
the
north
and
the
west

thither
in

part
they
had
turned
their
energies
we
find
them
on

huron
lake
superior
and
lake
michigan
laboring
vigorously
as
of
old
but
in
a
spirit
not
quite
the
same
now
as
before
two
objects
inspired
their
zeal
the
greater
glory
of
god
and
the
influence

credit
of
the
order
of
jesus

the
one
motive
had
somewhat
lost
in
power

other
had
gained
the
epoch
of
the
saints

passing
away

henceforth
we
find
the
canadian
jesuit
less
and
less
an
apostle
more
and
more
an
explorer
a
man
of
science
and
a
politician

yearly
reports
of
the
missions
are
still
for
the
edification
of
the
pious
reader
stuffed
with
intolerably
tedious
stories
of
baptisms
conversions
and
the
exemplary
deportment
of
neophytes
for
these
have
become
a
part
of
the

they
are
relieved
abundantly

more
mundane
topics

which
we
hope
ere

to

that
great
mysterious
river
of
which
the
indians
tell
us
flowing
southward
perhaps
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
perhaps
to
the
vermilion
sea
and
the
secrets
whereof
with
the
help
of
the
virgin
we
will
soon
reveal
to
the
world
the
jesuit
was
as
often
a
fanatic
for
his
order
as
for
his
faith
and
oftener
yet
the
two
fanaticisms
mingled
in
him
inextricably
ardently
as
he
burned
for
the
saving
of
souls
he
would
have
none
saved
on
the
upper
lakes
except
by
his
brethren
and
himself
he
claimed
a
monopoly
of
conversion
with
its
attendant
monopoly
of
toil
hardship
and
martyrdom
often
disinterested
for
himself
he
was
inordinately
ambitious
for
the
great
corporate
power
in
which
he
had
merged
his
own
personality
and
here
lies
one
cause
among
many

the
seeming
contradictions
which
abound

however

a

copper
weighing
from
six
hundred
to
eight
hundred
pounds
lying
on
the
shore
where
any
who
pass
may
see
it
and
he
farther
speaks
of
great
copper
boulders
in
the
bed
of
the
river

footnote
he
complains
that
the
indians
were
very
averse
to
giving
information
on
the
subject
so
that
the
jesuits
had
not
as
yet
discovered
the
metal
though
they
hoped
soon
to
do
so
the
indians
told
him
that
the
copper
had
first
been
found
by
four
hunters
who
had
landed
on
a
certain
island
near
the
north
shore
of
the
lake
wishing
to
boil
their
food
in
a
vessel
of
bark
they
gathered
stones
on
the
shore
heated
them
red
hot
and
threw
them
in
but
presently
discovered
them
to
be
pure
copper

repast
over
they
hastened
to
being
afraid
of
the
lynxes
and
the
hares
which
on
this
island
were
as
large
as
dogs
and
which
would
have
devoured
their
provisions
and
perhaps
their
canoe
they
took
with
them
some
of
the
wonderful
stones
but
scarcely
had
they
left
the
island
when
a
deep
voice
like
thunder
sounded
in
their
ears

are

thieves

steal
the
toys
of
my
children
it
was
the
god
of
the
waters
or
some

four
adventurers
retreated
in
great
terror
but
three
of
them
soon
died
and
the
fourth
survived
only
long

to
reach
his
village

island
has
no
foundation

this
was
a
noted
for

full
of

indians
came
thither
in
crowds
the
permanent
residents
were
an
ojibwa
band
called
by
the
french
sauteurs
whose
bark
lodges
were
clustered
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
near
the
fort
of
the
jesuits
besides
these
a
host
of
algonquins
of
various
tribes
resorted
thither
in
the
spring
and
summer
living
in
abundance
on
the
fishery
and
dispersing
in
winter
to
wander
and
starve
in

far
and

the
other
chief
mission
was
that
of

at

extremity
of

were
the
hurons
fugitives
twenty
years

slaughter
of

countrymen

tribes

him
by

best
that
he
could
report
of
the
hurons
after
all
the
toils
and
all
the
blood
lavished
in
their
conversion
was
that
they
still
retain

was
another

were
called

because

held
a

with

congregated
tribes
at

so
they
named
their

they
harangued

could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
writes
dablon

we
were
discoursing
on
very
important
subjects
namely
the
mysteries
of
our
religion
and
the
things
necessary
to
escaping
from
eternal
fire

the
fathers
were
delighted
with
the
country
which
dablon
calls
an
earthly
paradise
but
he
adds
that
the
way
to
it
is
as
hard
as
the
path
to
heaven
he
alludes
especially
to
the
rapids
of
fox
river
which
gave
the
two
travellers
great
trouble
having
safely
passed
them
they
saw
an
indian
idol
on
the
bank
similar
to
that
which
dollier
and
galinée
found
at
detroit
being
merely
a
rock
bearing
some
resemblance
to

hideously
painted
with
the
help
of
their
attendants

threw
it

praises

of

he
found

incensed
against

the
which
some
of
their
tribe
had
lately
met
with
when
on
a
to
montreal
and
they
received
the
faith
with
shouts
of
derision
the
priest
was
at
what
he
saw
their
lodges
each
containing
from
five
to
ten
families
seemed
in
his
eyes
like
seraglios
for
some
of
the
chiefs
had
eight
wives
he
armed
himself
with
patience
and
at
length
gained
a
hearing
nay
he
succeeded
so
well
that
when
he
showed
them
his
crucifix
they
would
throw
tobacco
on
it
as
an
offering
and
on
another
visit
which
he
made
them
soon
after
he
taught
the
whole
village
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
a
was
going
out
against
their
enemies
and
he
bethought
him
of
telling
them
the
story
of
the
cross
and
the
emperor
constantine
this
so
wrought
upon
them
that
they
all
daubed
the
figure
of
a
cross
on
their
shields
of
set
out
for
the
war
and
came
back
victorious
extolling
the
sacred
symbol
as
a
great
thus
it
is
writes
dablon
who
chronicles
the
incident
that
our
holy
faith
is
established
among
these
people
and
we
have
good
hope
that
we
shall
soon
carry
it
to
the
famous
river
called
the
mississippi
and
perhaps
even
to
the
south

footnote
most
things
human
have
their
phases
of
the
ludicrous
and
the
heroism
of
these
untiring
priests
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
the
various
missionary
stations
were
much
alike
they
consisted
of
a
chapel
commonly
of
logs
and
one
or
more
houses
with
perhaps
a
storehouse
and
a
workshop
the
whole
fenced
with
palisades
and
forming
in
fact
a
stockade
fort
surrounded
with
clearings
and
cultivated
fields
it
is
evident
that
the
priests
had
need
of
other
hands
than
their
own
and
those
of
the
few
lay
brothers
attached
to
the
mission
they
required
men
inured
to
labor
accustomed
to
the
forest
life
able
to
guide
canoes
and
handle
tools
and
weapons
in
the
earlier
epoch
of
the
missions
when
enthusiasm
was
at
its
height
they
were
served
in
great
measure
by
volunteers
who
joined
them
through
devotion
or
penitence
and
who
were
known
as
or
given
men
of
late
the
number
of
these
had
much
diminished
and
they
now
relied
chiefly
on
hired
men

these
were
employed
in

this
charge
of

which
if
the
results
were

does
not

involve

tremble

obeys

raises
a

on

some
embark
in

your

carry
only
four

our

carry
four

a

in

he
kills

does
not
reckon
them
by

scalps
but
by
the
streams
of
blood
which
he
causes
to
flow
he
takes
so
many
prisoners
that
he
holds
them
in
no
account
but
lets
them
go
where
they
will
to
show
that
he
is
not
afraid
of
them

now
nobody
dares
make
war
on
him
all
the

heart
divorced

a

element
of

that
on
which
joliet
arrived
with
orders
from
count
frontenac
our
governor
and
from
talon
our
intendant
to
go
with
me
on
this
discovery
i
was
all
the
more
delighted
at
this
good
news
because
i
saw
my
plans
about
to
be
accomplished
and
found
myself
in
the
happy
necessity
of
exposing
my
life
for
the
salvation
of
all
these
tribes
and
especially
of
the
illinois
who
when
i
was
at
point
esprit
had
begged
me
very
earnestly
to
bring
the
word
of
god
among
them
the
outfit
of
the
travellers
was
very
simple
they
provided
themselves
with
two
birch
canoes
and
a
supply
of
smoked
meat
and
indian
corn
embarked
with
five
men
and
began
their
voyage
on
the
seventeenth
of
may
they
had
obtained
all
possible
information
from
the
indians
and
had
made
by
means
of
it
a
species
of
map
of
their
intended
route
above
all
writes
marquette
i
placed
our
voyage
under
the
protection
of
the
holy
virgin
immaculate
promising
that
if
she
granted
us
the
favor
of
discovering
the
great
river
i
would
give
it
the
name
of
the
conception
footnote
the
doctrine
of
the
immaculate
conception
sanctioned
in
our
own
time
by
the
pope
was
always
a
favorite
tenet
of
the
jesuits
and
marquette
was
especially
devoted
to
it
their
course
was
westward
and
plying
their
paddles
they
passed
the
straits
of
michillimackinac
and
coasted
the
northern
shores
of
lake
michigan
landing
at
evening
to
build
their
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
draw
up
their
canoes
on

strand
they
soon
reached
the
river

of
this
region
when
they
told
them
the
object
of
their
voyage
they
were
filled
with
astonishment
and
used
their
best
ingenuity
to
dissuade
them
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
they
said
were
inhabited
by
ferocious
tribes
who
put
every
stranger
to
death
tomahawking
all
without
cause

they
added
that
there
was
a
demon
in

part
of

whose
roar
could
be
heard
at
a

had
an
eye
for

beauty
was
delighted
with
the
situation
of
the
town

he
describes
as
standing
on
the
crown
of
a
hill
while
all
around
the
prairie
stretched
beyond
the
sight
interspersed
with
groves
and
belts
of
tall
forest
but
he
was
still
more
delighted
when
he
saw
a
cross
planted
in
the
midst
of
the
place
the
indians
had
decorated
it
with
a
number
of
dressed
red
girdles
and
bows
and
arrows
which
they
had
hung
upon
it
as
an
offering
to
the
great
manitou
of
the
french
a
sight
by
which
as
marquette
says
he
was
extremely
consoled
the
travellers
had
no
sooner
reached
the
town
than
they
called
the
chiefs
and
elders
to
a
council
joliet
told
them
that
the
governor
of
canada
had
sent
him
to
discover
new
countries
and
that
god
had
sent
his
companion
to
teach
the
true
faith
to
the
inhabitants
and
he
prayed
for
guides
to
show
them
the
way
to
the
waters
of

wisconsin
the
council
readily
consented

on
the
tenth

conduct
them
all

down

were
the
miamis
with
long
locks
of
hair
dangling
over
each
ear
after
a
fashion
which

thought
very
becoming
and
here
too
the
mascoutins
and
the
kickapoos
whom
he
describes
as
mere
boors
in
comparison
with
their
miami

an
enterprise

hazardous

brought
them
at

portage
where
after
carrying
their
canoes
a
mile
and
a
half
over
the

through

they
launched
them
on
the
wisconsin

farewell
to
the
waters
that
flowed
to

not
whither
perhaps
to

perhaps
to

the

taken
from
personal
observation

found
what
they
sought
and
with
a
joy
writes

which
i
can
not
express
they
steered
forth
their
canoes
on
the
eddies
of
the
mississippi
turning
southward
they
paddled
down
the
stream
through
a
solitude
unrelieved

a

they
caught

appearance
greatly
astonished
them
at

the
buffalo
began
to
appear
grazing
in
herds
on
the
great
prairies
which
then
bordered
the
river

describes
the
fierce
and
stupid
look
of
the
old
bulls
as
they
stared
at
the
intruders
through
the
tangled
mane
which
nearly
blinded
them

advanced
with
extreme
caution
landed
at
night
and
made
a
fire
to
cook

again
paddled
some
way
farther
and
anchored
in

stream
keeping
a

on

morning
they
had
journeyed
more
than
a
fortnight
without
meeting
a
human
being
when
on

they
discovered
footprints
of
men
in
the
mud
of
the
western
bank
and
a
path
that
led
to
the
adjacent

resolved
to
follow
it
and
leaving
the
canoes
in
charge
of
their
men
they
set
out
on
their
hazardous
adventure
the
day
was
fair
and
they
walked
two
leagues
in
silence
following
the
path
through
the
forest
and
across
the
sunny
prairie
till
they
discovered
an
indian
village
on
the
banks
of
a
river
and
two
others
on
a
hill
half
a
league
distant
footnote
the
indian
villages

corresponding
in
position
with
the
des

though
the
distance
from
the
wisconsin
as
given
by
him
would
indicate
a
river
farther
north
now
with
beating
hearts
they
invoked
the
aid
of
heaven
and
again
advancing
came
so
near
without
being
seen
that
they
could
hear
the
voices
of
the
indians
among
the
wigwams
then
they
stood
forth
in
full
view
and
shouted
to
attract
attention
there
was
great
commotion
in
the
village
the
inmates
swarmed
out
of
their
huts
and
four
of
their
chief
men
presently
came
forward
to
meet
the
strangers
advancing
very
deliberately
and
holding
up
toward
the
sun
two
calumets
or
decorated
with
feathers
they
stopped
abruptly
before
the
two
frenchmen
and
stood
gazing
at
them
with
attention
without
speaking
a
word
marquette
was
much
relieved
on
seeing
that
they
wore
french
cloth
whence
he
judged
that
they
must
be
friends
and
allies
he
broke
the
silence
and
asked
them
who
they
were
whereupon
they
answered
that
they
were
illinois
and
offered
the
pipe
which
having
been
duly
smoked
they
all
went
together
to
the
village
here
the
chief
received
the
travellers
after
a
singular
fashion
meant
to
do
them
honor
he
stood
stark
naked
at
the
door
of
a
large
wigwam
holding
up
both
hands
as
if
to
shield
his
eyes
frenchmen
how
bright
the
sun
shines
when
you
come
to
visit
us
all
our
village
awaits
you
and
you
shall
enter
our
wigwams
in
peace
so
saying
he
led
them
into
his
own
which
was
crowded
to
suffocation
with
savages
staring
at
their
guests
in
silence
having
smoked
with
the
chiefs
and
old
men
they
were
invited
to
visit
the
great
chief
of
all
the
illinois
at
one
of
the
villages
they
had
seen
in
the
distance
and
thither
they
proceeded
followed
by
a
throng
of
warriors
squaws
and
children
on
arriving
they
were
forced
to
smoke
again
and
listen
to
a
speech
of
welcome
from
the
great
chief
who
delivered
it
standing
between
two
old
men
naked
like
himself
his
lodge
was
crowded
with
the
dignitaries
of
the
tribe
whom
marquette
addressed
in
algonquin
announcing
himself
as
a
messenger
sent
by
the
god
who
had
made
them
and
whom
it
behooved
them
to
recognize
and
obey
he
added
a
few
words
touching
the
power
and
glory
of
count
frontenac
and
concluded
by
asking
information
concerning
the
mississippi
and
the
tribes
along
its
banks
whom
he
was
on
his
way
to
visit
the
chief
replied
with
a
speech
of
compliment
assuring
his
guests
that
their
presence
added
flavor
to
his
tobacco
made
the
river
more
calm
the
sky
more
serene
and
the
earth
more
beautiful
in
conclusion
he
gave
them
a
young
slave
and
a
calumet
begging
them
at
the
same
time
to
abandon
their
purpose
of
descending
the
mississippi
a
feast
of
four
courses
now
followed
first
a
wooden
bowl
full
of
a
porridge
of
indian
meal
boiled
with
grease
was
set
before
the
guests
and
the
master
of
ceremonies
fed
them
in
turn
like
infants
with
a
large
spoon
then
appeared
a
platter
of
fish
and
the
same
functionary
carefully
removing
the
bones
with
his
fingers
and
blowing
on
the
morsels
to
cool
them
placed
them
in
the
mouths
of
the
two
frenchmen
a
large
dog
killed
and
cooked
for
the
occasion
was
next
placed
before
them
but
failing
to
tempt
their
fastidious
appetites
was
supplanted
by
a
dish
of
fat
which
concluded
the
entertainment
the
crowd
having
dispersed
were
spread
on
the
ground
and
marquette
and
joliet
spent
the
night
on
the
scene
of
the
late
festivity
in
the
morning
the
chief
with
some
six
hundred
of
his
tribesmen
escorted
them
to
their
canoes
and
bade
them
after
their
stolid
fashion
a
friendly
farewell
again
they
were
on
their
way
slowly
drifting
down
the
great
river
they
passed
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
and
glided
beneath
that
line
of
rocks
on
the
eastern
side
cut
into
fantastic
forms
by
the
elements
and
marked
as
the
ruined
castles
on
some
of
the
early
french
maps
presently
they
beheld
a
sight
which
reminded
them
that
the
devil
was
still
lord
paramount
of
this
wilderness
on
the
flat
face
of
a
high
rock
were
painted
in
red
black
and
green
a
pair
of
monsters
each
as
large
as
a
calf
with
horns
like
a
deer
red
eyes
a
beard
like
a
tiger
and
a
frightful
expression
of
countenance
the
face
is
something
like
that
of
a
man
the
body
covered
with
scales
and
the
tail
so
long
that
it
passes
entirely
round
the
body
over
the
head
and
between
the
legs
ending
like
that
of
a
fish
such
is
the
account
which
the
worthy
jesuit
gives
of
these
or
indian
gods

rock

these
figures
were
painted

says
that
his
indians
made
sacrifices
to
them
as
they
passed
he
confesses
that
at
first
they
frightened
him
and
his
imagination
and
that
of
his
credulous
companions
were
so
wrought
upon
by
these
unhallowed
efforts
of
indian
art
that
they
continued
for
a
long
time
to
talk
of
them
as
they
plied
their
paddles
they
were
thus
engaged
when
they
were
suddenly
aroused
by
a
real
danger
a
torrent
of
yellow
mud
rushed
furiously
athwart
the
calm
blue
current
of
the
mississippi
boiling
and
surging
and
sweeping
in
its
course
logs
branches
and
uprooted
trees
they
had
reached
the
mouth
of
the
missouri
where
that
savage
river
descending
from
its
mad
career
through
a
vast
unknown
of
barbarism
poured
its
turbid
floods
into
the
bosom
of
its
gentler
sister
their
light
canoes
whirled
on
the
miry
vortex
like
dry
leaves
on
an
angry
brook
i
never
writes
marquette
saw
any
thing
more
terrific
but
they
escaped
with
their
fright
and
held
their
way
down
the
turbulent
and
swollen
current
of
the
now
united
rivers

missouri

to
see
the
marshy
shores

in

dense
growth

the
cane
with
its
tall
straight
stems

the

with
a
languid
stifling
heat
and
by
day

mosquitoes
in
myriads
left
them
no

they
floated
slowly
down
the
current
crouched
in
the
shade
of
the
sails
which
they
had
spread
as
awnings
when
suddenly
they
saw
indians
on
the
east
bank
the
surprise
was
mutual
and
each
party
was
as
much
frightened
as
the
other
marquette
hastened
to
display
the
calumet
which
the
illinois
had
given
him
by
way
of
passport
and
the
indians
recognizing
the
pacific
symbol
replied
with
an
invitation
to
land
evidently
they
were
in
communication
with
europeans

they
were
armed
with
guns
knives

hatchets
wore
garments

carried
their
gunpowder
in
small
bottles

feasted
the
frenchmen
with
bear

gave
them
a

the
agreeable

delusive
assurance
that
they
would
reach
the

in
ten

it
was
in

more
than
a

resumed
their
course
and
again
floated
down
the
interminable
monotony
of
river
marsh
and
forest
day
after
day
passed
on
in
solitude
and
they
had
paddled
some
three
hundred
miles
since
their
meeting
with
the
indians
when
as
they
neared
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
they
saw
a
cluster
of
wigwams
on
the
west
bank
their
inmates
were
all
astir
yelling

snatching
their
weapons

running
to
the
shore
to
meet
the
strangers
who
on
their
part
called
for
succor
to
the
virgin
in
truth
they
had
need
of
her
aid
for
several
large
wooden
canoes
filled
with
savages
were
putting
out
from
the
shore
above
and
below
them
to
cut
off
their
retreat
while
a
swarm
of
headlong
young
warriors
waded
into
the
water
to
attack
them
the
current
proved
too
strong
and
failing
to
reach
the
canoes
of
the
frenchmen
one
of
them
threw
his
which
flew
over
the
heads
of
the
startled
travellers
meanwhile
marquette
had
not
ceased
to
hold
up
his
calumet
to
which
the
excited
crowd
gave
no
heed
but
strung
their
bows
and
notched
their
arrows
for
immediate
action
when
at
length
the
elders
of
the
village
arrived
saw
the
restrained
the
ardor
of
the
youth
and
urged
the
frenchmen
to
come
ashore
marquette
and
his
companions
complied
trembling
and
found
a
better
reception
than
they
had
reason
to
expect
one
of
the
indians
spoke
a
little
illinois

served
as
interpreter
a
friendly
conference
was
followed
by
a
feast
of
sagamite
and
fish
and
the
travellers
not
without
sore
misgivings
spent
the
night
in
the
lodges

their
entertainers

this
village
called
mitchigamea
is

early
in

morning
they
embarked
again
and
proceeded
to
a
village
of
the
arkansas
tribe
about
eight
leagues
below
notice
of
their
coming
was
sent
before
them
by
their
late
hosts
and
as
they
drew
near
they
were
met
by
a
canoe
in
the
prow
of
which
stood
a
naked
personage
holding
a
calumet
singing
and
making
gestures
of
friendship
on
reaching
the
village

was
on
the
east
side

a
few
years
later
the
arkansas
were
all
on
the
west
side
opposite
the
mouth
of

they
were
conducted
to
a
sort
of
scaffold
before
the
lodge
of
the
the
space
beneath
had
been
prepared
for
their
reception

ground
being
neatly
covered
with

they
were
seated
the

sat
around
them
in

the
elders
of

tribe
and
then
the
promiscuous
crowd
of
villagers
standing
and
staring
over
the
heads
of
the
more
dignified
members
of
the
assembly
all
the
men
were
naked
but
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of
clothing
they
wore
strings
of
beads
in
their
noses
and
ears
the
women
were
clothed
in
shabby
skins
and
wore
their
hair
clumped
in
a
mass
behind
each
ear
by
good
luck
there
was
a
young
indian
in
the
village
who
had
an
excellent
knowledge
of
illinois
and
through
him
marquette
endeavored
to
explain
the
mysteries
of
christianity
and
to
gain
information
concerning
the
river
below
to
this
end
he
gave
his
auditors
the
presents
indispensable
on
such
occasions
but
received
very
little
in
return
they
told
him
that
the
mississippi
was
infested
by
hostile
indians
armed
with
guns
procured
from
white
men
and
that
they
the
arkansas
stood
in
such
fear
of
them
that
they
dared
not
hunt
the
buffalo
but
were
forced
to
live
on
indian
corn
of
which
they
raised
three
crops
a
year
during
the
speeches
on
either
side
food
was
brought
in
without
ceasing
sometimes
a
platter
of
sagamite
or
mush
sometimes
of
corn
boiled
whole
sometimes
a
roasted
dog
the
villagers
had
large
earthen
pots
and
platters
made
by
themselves
with
tolerable
skill
as
well
as
hatchets
knives
and
beads
gained
by
traffic
with
the
illinois
and
other
tribes
in
contact
with
the
french
or
spaniards
all
day
there
was
feasting
without
respite
after
the
merciless
practice
of
indian
hospitality
but
at
night
some
of
their
entertainers
proposed
to
kill
and
plunder
them
a
scheme
which
was
defeated
by
the
vigilance
of
the
chief
who
visited
their
quarters
and
danced
the
calumet
dance
to
reassure
his
guests
the
travellers
now
held
counsel
as
to
what
course
they
should
take
they
had
gone
far
enough
as
they
thought
to
establish
one
important
point
that
the
mississippi
discharged
its
waters
not
into
the
atlantic
or
sea
of
virginia
nor
into
the
gulf
of
california
or
vermilion
sea
but
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
they
thought
themselves
nearer
to
its
mouth
than
they
actually
were
the
distance
being
still
about
seven
hundred
miles
and
they
feared
that
if
they
went
farther
they
might
be
killed
by
indians
or
captured
by
spaniards
whereby
the
results
of
their
discovery
would
be
lost
therefore
they
resolved
to
return
to
canada
and
report
what
they
had
seen
they
left
the
arkansas
village
and
began
their
homeward
voyage
on
the
seventeenth
of
july
it
was
no
easy
task
to
urge
their
way
upward
in
the
heat
of
midsummer
against
the
current
of
the
dark
and
gloomy
stream
toiling
all
day
under
the
parching
sun
and
sleeping
at
night
in
the
exhalations
of
the
unwholesome
shore

attacked
with

languid

invoked
his
celestial
mistress
as
day
after

and
week
after

they
won
their
slow
way
northward
at
length
they
reached
the
illinois
and
entering
its
mouth
followed
its
course
charmed
as
they
went
with
its
placid
waters
its
shady
forests

attention
to

he
made
a
journey
thither
in

returned
to

he
reported
that
unless

formidable
rivals

lay
before

floated
down
the
swollen
current

reached
its
junction

marquette
calls

as
we
are
told

was
received
like
an

passed
from
wigwam
to
wigwam
telling
the
listening
crowds
of
god
and
the
virgin
paradise
and
hell
angels
and
demons
and
when
he
thought
their
minds
prepared
he
summoned
them
all
to
a
grand
council

took
place
near
the
town
on
the

an
old
indian
woman
born
in
at

her

the
tradition
has
a

to
that
related
as
fact
by
charlevoix
the
old
squaw
said
that
the
jesuit
was
returning
very
ill
to
michillimackinac
when
a
storm
forced
him
and
his
two
men
to
land
near
a
little
river
here
he
told
them
that
he
should
die
and
directed
them
to
ring
a
bell
over
his
grave
and
plant
a
cross
they
all
remained
four
days
at
the
spot
and
though
without
food
the
men
felt
no
hunger
on
the
night
of
the
fourth
day
he
died
and
the
men
buried
him
as
he
had
directed
on
waking
in
the
morning
they
saw
a
sack
of
indian
corn
a
quantity
of
lard
and
some
biscuits
miraculously
sent
to
them
in

with
the
promise
of
marquette
who
had
told
them
that
they
should
have
food
enough
for
their
journey
to
michillimackinac
at
the

instant
the
stream
began
to
rise
and
in
a
few
moments
encircled
the
grave
of
the
jesuit
which
formed
thenceforth
an
islet
in
the
waters
the
tradition
adds
that
an
indian
battle
afterwards
took
place
on
the
banks
of
this
stream
between
christians
and
infidels
and
that
the
former
gained
the
victory
in
consequence
of
invoking
the
name
of
marquette
this
story
bears
the
attestation
of
the
priest
of
the
two
mountains
that
it
is
a
literal
translation
of
the
tradition
as
recounted
by
the
old
woman
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
illinois
country
was
visited
by
two
priests
some
time
before
the
visit
of
marquette
this
assertion
was
first
made
by
noiseux
late
grand
vicar
of
quebec
who
gives
no
authority
for
it
not
the
slightest
indication
of
any
such
visit
appears
in
any
contemporary
document
or

thus
far
discovered
the
contemporary
writers
down
to

la

all
speak
of

an

the

and
his

and
by

side
stands
the

prodigious
was
the
contrast
between
the
two
discoverers
the
one
with
clasped
hands
and
upturned
eyes
seems
a
figure
evoked
from
some
dim
legend
of
mediaeval
saintship
the
other
with
feet
firm
planted
on
the
hard
earth
breathes
the
energies
of
modern
practical
enterprise
nevertheless
la
salle
was
a
man
wedded
to
ideas
and
urged
by
the
steady
and
considerate
enthusiasm
which
is
the
of
heroic
natures
three
thoughts
rapidly
developing
in
his
mind
were
mastering
him
and
engendering
an
invincible
purpose
first
he
would
achieve
that
which
champlain
had
vainly
attempted
and
of
which
our
own
generation
has
but
now
seen
the
accomplishment
the
opening
of
a
passage
to
india
and
china
across
the
american
continent
next
he
would
occupy
the
great
west
develop
its
commercial
resources
and
anticipate
the
spaniards
and
the
english
in
the
possession
of
it
thirdly
for
he
soon
became
convinced
that
the
mississippi
discharged
itself
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
he
would
establish
a
fortified
post
at
its
mouth
thus
securing
an
outlet
for
the
trade
of
the
interior
checking
the
progress
of
the
spaniards
and
forming
a
base
whence
in
time
of
war
their
northern
provinces
could
be
invaded
and
conquered
here
were
vast
projects
projects
perhaps
beyond
the
scope
of
private
enterprise
conceived
and
nursed
in
the
brain
of
a
penniless
young
man
two
conditions
were
indispensable
to
their
achievement
the
first
was
the
countenance
of
the
canadian
authorities
and
the
second
was
money
there
was
but
one
mode
of
securing
either
to
appeal
to
the
love
of
gain
of
those
who
could
aid
the
enterprise
count
frontenac
had
no
money
to
give
but
he
had
what
was
no
less
to
the
purpose
the
resources
of
an
arbitrary
power
which
he
was
always
ready
to
use
to
the
utmost
from
the
manner
in
which
he
mentions
la
salle
in
his
despatches
it
seems
that
the
latter
succeeded
in
gaining
his
confidence
very
soon
after
he
entered
upon
his
government
there
was
a
certain
similarity
between
the
two
men
both
were
able
resolute
and
enterprising
the
irascible
and
fiery
pride
of
the
noble
found
its
match
in
the
reserved
and
seemingly
cold
pride
of
the
ambitious
young
burgher
their
temperaments
were
different
but
the
bases
of
their
characters
were
alike
and
each
could
perfectly
comprehend
the
other
they
had
moreover
strong
prejudices
and
dislikes
in
common
with
his
ruined
fortune
his
habits
of
expenditure
the
exigent
demands
of
his
rank
and
station
and
the
wretched
pittance
which
he
received
from
the
king
of
three
thousand
francs
a
year
frontenac
was
not
the
man
to
let
slip
any
reasonable
opportunity
of
bettering
his
condition

he
engaged

the
was
notorious

a
letter
to

intendant
of

that
frontenac
used
all
the
authority
of
his
office
to
favor
those
interested
in
trade
with
him
and
that
he
would
favor
nobody
else
the
intendant
himself
had
a
rival
interest
in
the
same
trade
la
salle
seems
to
have
laid
his
plans
before
him
as
far
as
he
had
at
this
time
formed
them
and
a
complete
understanding
was
established
between
them
here
was
a
great
point
gained
the
head
of
the
colony
was
on
his
side
it
remained
to
raise
money
and
this
was
a
harder
task
la

relations

evidently
proud
of
him

anxious
for

some
of

but
here
we
are
anticipating
clearly
to
understand
his
position
we
must
revert
to
the
first
year
of
government
no
sooner
had
that
astute
official
set
foot
in
the
colony
than
with
an
eagle
eye
he
surveyed
the
situation
and
quickly
comprehended
it
it
was
somewhat
peculiar
canada
lived
on
the
a
species
of
commerce
always
liable
to
disorders
and
which
had
produced
among
other
results
a
lawless
body
of
men
known
as
de
who
followed
the
indians
in
their
wanderings
and
sometimes
became
as
barbarous
as
their
red
associates
the
king
who
swayed
the
destinies
of
france
taking
umbrage
at
these
irregularities
had
issued
mandates
intended
to
repress
the
evil
by
prohibiting
the
inhabitants
of
canada
from
leaving
the
limits
of
the
settled
country
and
requiring
the
trade
to
be
carried
on
not
in
the
distant
wilderness
but
within
the
bounds
of
the
colony
the
civil
and
military
officers
of
the
crown
charged
with
the
execution
of
these
ordinances
showed
a
sufficient
zeal
in
enforcing
them
against
others
while
they
themselves
habitually
violated
them
hence
a
singular
confusion
with
abundant
outcries
complaint
and
recrimination
prominent
among
these
officials
was
perrot
governor
of
montreal
who
must
not
be
confounded
with
nicolas
perrot
the
the
governor
of
montreal
though
subordinate
to
the
held
great
and
arbitrary
power
within
his
own
jurisdiction
perrot
had
married
a
niece
of
talon
the
late
intendant
to
whose
influence
he
owed
his
place
confiding
in
this
powerful
protection
he
gave
free
rein
to
his
and
carried
his
government
with
a
high
hand
berating
and
abusing
anybody
who
ventured
to
remonstrate
the
grave
fathers
of
sulpice
owners
of
montreal
were
the
more
scandalized
at
the
behavior
of
their
military
chief
by
reason
of
a
certain
burlesque
and
gasconading
vein
which
often
appeared
in
him
and
which
they
regarded
as
unseemly
levity
footnote
perrot
received
his
appointment
from
the
seminary
of
sulpice
on
talon
recommendation
but
he
afterwards
applied
for
and
gained
a
royal
commission
which
as
he
thought
made
him
independent
of
the
priests
perrot
through
his
wife
uncle
had
obtained
a
grant
of
the
island
above
montreal
which
still
bears
his
name
here
he
established
a
trading
house
which
he
placed
in
charge
of
an
agent
one
brucy
who
by
a
tempting
display
of
merchandise
and
liquors
intercepted
the
indians
on
their
yearly
descent
to
trade
with
the
french
and
thus
got
possession
of
their
furs
in
anticipation
of
the
market
of
montreal
not
satisfied
with
this
perrot
in
defiance
of
the
royal
order
sent
men
into
the
woods
to
trade
with
the
indians
in
their
villages
and
it
is
said
even
used
his
soldiers
for
this
purpose
under
cover
of
pretended
desertion
footnote
the
original
papers
relating
to
the
accusations
against
perrot
are
still
preserved
in
the
ancient
records
of
montreal
the
rage
of
the
merchants
of
montreal
may
readily
be
conceived
and
when
frontenac
heard
of
the
behavior
of
his
subordinate
he
was
duly
incensed
it
seems
however
to
have
occurred
or
to
have
been
suggested
to
him
that
he
the
might
repeat
the
device
of
perrot
on
a
larger
scale
and
with
more
profitable
results
by
establishing
a
fortified
trading
post
on
lake
ontario
the
whole
trade
of
the
upper
country
might
be
engrossed
with
the
exception
of
that
portion
of
it
which
descended
by
the
river
ottawa
and
even
this
might
in
good
part
be
diverted
from
its
former
channel
at
the
same
time
a
plan
of
a
fort
on
lake
ontario
might
be
made
to
appear
as
of
great
importance
to
the
welfare
of
the
colony
and
in
fact
from
one
point
of
view
it
actually
was
so
courcelles
the
late
governor
had
already
pointed
out
its
advantages
such
a
fort
would
watch
and
hold
in
check
the
iroquois
the
worst
enemy
of
canada
and
with
the
aid
of
a
few
small
vessels
it
would
intercept
the
trade
which
the
upper
indians
were
carrying
on
through
the
iroquois
country
with
the
english
and
dutch
of
new
york
frontenac
learned
from
la
salle
that
the
english
were
intriguing
both
with
the
iroquois
and
with
the
tribes
of
the
upper
lakes
to
induce
them
to
break
the
peace
with
the

hence
the
advantages
not
to
say
the
necessity
of
a
fort
on
lake
ontario
were
obvious
but
while
it
would
turn
a
stream
of
wealth
from
the
english
to
the
french
colony
it
was
equally
clear
that
the
change
might
be
made
to
inure
not
to
the
profit
of
canada
at
large
but
solely
to
that
of
those
who
had
control
of
the
fort
or
in
other
words
that
the
new
establishment
might
become
an
instrument
of
a
grievous
monopoly
this
frontenac
and
la
salle
well
understood
and
there
can
be
no
reasonable
doubt
that
they
aimed
at
securing
such
a
monopoly
but
the
merchants
of
canada
understood
it
also
and
hence
they
regarded
with
distrust
any
scheme
of
a
fort
on
lake
ontario
frontenac
therefore
thought
it
expedient
to
make
use
as
he
expresses
it
of
address
he
gave
out
merely
that
he
intended
to
make
a
tour
through
the
upper
parts
of
the
colony
with
an
armed
force
in
order
to
inspire
the
indians
with
respect
and
secure
a
solid
peace
he
had
neither
troops
money
munitions
nor
means
of
transportation
yet
there
was
no
time
to
lose
for
should
he
delay
the
execution
of
his
plan
it
might
be
countermanded
by
the
king
his
only
resource
therefore
was
in
a
prompt
and
hardy
exertion
of
the
royal
authority
and
he
issued
an
order
requiring
the
inhabitants
of
quebec
montreal
three
rivers
and
other
settlements
to
furnish
him
at
their
own
cost
as
soon
as
the
spring
sowing
should
be
over
with
a
certain
number
of
armed
men
besides
the
requisite
canoes
at
the
same
time
he
invited
the
officers
settled
in
the
country
to
join
the
expedition
an
invitation
which
anxious
as
they
were
to
gain
his
good
graces
few
of
them
cared
to
decline
regardless
of
murmurs
and
discontent
he
pushed
his
preparation
vigorously
and
on
the
third
of
june
left
quebec
with
his
guard
his
staff
a
part
of
the
garrison
of
the
castle
of
louis
and
a
number
of
volunteers
he
had
already
sent
to
la
salle
who
was
then
at
montreal
directing
him
to
repair
to
onondaga
the
political
centre
of
the
iroquois
and
invite
their
sachems
to
meet
the
governor
in
council
at
the
bay
of
quinté
on
the
north
of
lake
ontario
la
salle
had
set
out
on
his
mission
but
first
sent
frontenac
a
map
which
convinced
him
that
the
best
site
for
his
proposed
fort
was
the
mouth
of
the
cataraqui
where
kingston
now
stands
another
messenger
was
accordingly
despatched
to
change
the
rendezvous
to
this
point
meanwhile
the
governor
proceeded
at
his
leisure
towards
montreal
stopping
by
the
way
to
visit
the
officers
settled
along
the
bank
who
eager
to
pay
their
homage
to
the
newly
risen
sun
received
him
with
a
hospitality
which
under
the
roof
of
a
log
hut
was
sometimes
graced
by
the
polished
courtesies
of
the
salon
and
the
boudoir
reaching
montreal
which
he
had
never
before
seen
he
gazed
we
may
suppose
with
some
interest
at
the
long
row
of
humble
dwellings
which
lined
the
bank
the
massive
buildings
of
the
seminary
and
the
spire
of
the
church
predominant
over
all
it
was
a
rude
scene
but
the
greeting
that
awaited
him
savored
nothing
of
the
rough
simplicity
of
the
wilderness
perrot
the
local
governor
was
on
the
shore
with
his
soldiers
and
the
inhabitants
drawn
up
under
arms
and
firing
a
salute
to
welcome
the
representative
of
the
king
frontenac
was
compelled
to
listen
to
a
long
harangue
from
the
judge
of
the
place
followed
by
another
from
the
syndic
then
there
was
a
solemn
procession
to
the
church
where
he
was
forced
to
undergo
a
third
effort
of
oratory
from
one
of
the
priests
followed
in
thanks
for
his
arrival
and
then
he
took
refuge
in
the
fort
here
he
remained
thirteen
days
busied
with
his
preparations
organizing
the
militia
soothing
their
mutual
jealousies
and
settling
knotty
questions
of
rank
and
precedence
during
this
time
every
means
as
he
declares
was
used
to
prevent
him
from
proceeding
and
among
other
devices
a
rumor
was
set
on
foot
that
a
dutch
fleet
having
just
captured
boston
was
on
its
way
to
attack
quebec

this

it

originated
with

the
jesuits
were
greatly
opposed
to

frontenac
himself
followed
on
the
of
june
he
now
had
with
him
about
four
hundred
men
including
indians
from
the
missions
and
a
hundred
and
twenty
canoes
besides
two
large
flatboats
which
he
caused
to
be
painted
in
red
and
blue
with
strange
devices
intended
to
dazzle
the
iroquois
by
a
display
of
unwonted
splendor
now
their
hard
task
began
shouldering
canoes
through
the
forest
dragging
the
flatboats
along
the
shore
working
like
beavers
sometimes
in
water
to
the
knees
sometimes
to
the
armpits
their
feet
cut
by
the
sharp
stones
and
they
themselves
well
nigh
swept
down
by
the
furious
current
they
fought
their
way
upward
against
the
chain
of
mighty
rapids
that
break
the
navigation
of
the
lawrence
the
indians
were
of
the
greatest
service
frontenac
like
la

showed
from
the
first
a
special
faculty
of
managing
them
for
his
keen
incisive
spirit
was
exactly
to
their
liking
and
they
worked
for
him
as
they
would
have
worked
for
no
man
else
as
they
approached
the
long
saut
rain
fell
in
torrents
and
the
governor
without
his
cloak
and
drenched
to
the
skin
directed
in
person
the
amphibious
toil
of
his
followers
once
it
is
said
he
lay
awake
all
night
in
his
anxiety
lest
the
biscuit
should
be
wet
which
would
have
ruined
the
expedition
no
such
mischance
took
place
and
at
length
the
last
rapid
was
passed
and
smooth
water
awaited
them
to
their
journey
end
soon
they
reached
the
thousand
islands
and
their
light
flotilla
glided
in
long
file
among
those
watery
labyrinths
by
rocky
islets
where
some
lonely
pine
towered
like
a
mast
against
the
sky
by
crags
where
the
brown
lichens
crisped
in
the
parching
glare
by
deep
dells
shady
and
cool
rich
in
rank
ferns
and
spongy
dark
green
mosses
by
still
coves
where
the
lay
like
on
their
broad
flat
leaves
till
at
length
they
neared
their
goal
and
the
glistening
bosom
of
lake
ontario
opened
on
their
sight
frontenac
to
impose
respect
on
the
iroquois
now
set
his
canoes
in
order
of
battle
four
divisions
formed
the
first
line
then
came
the
two
flatboats
he
himself
with
his
guards
his
staff
and
the
gentlemen
volunteers
followed
with
the
canoes
of
three
rivers
on
his
right
and
those
of
the
indians
on
his
left
while
two
remaining
divisions
formed
a
rear
line
thus
with
measured
paddles
they
advanced
over
the
still
lake
till
they
saw
a
canoe
approaching
to
meet
them
it
bore
several
iroquois
chiefs
who
told
them
that
the
dignitaries
of
their
nation
awaited
them
at
cataraqui
and
offered
to
guide
them
to
the
spot
they
entered
the
wide
mouth
of
the
river
and
passed
along
the
shore
now
covered
by
the
quiet
little
city
of
kingston
till
they
reached
the
point
at
present
occupied
by
the
barracks
at
the
western
end
of
cataraqui
bridge
here
they
stranded
their
canoes
and
disembarked
baggage
was
landed
fires
lighted
tents
pitched
and
guards
set
close
at
hand
under
the
lee
of
the
forest
were
the
camping
sheds
of
the
iroquois
who
had
come
to
the
rendezvous
in
considerable
numbers
at
daybreak
of
the
next
morning
the
thirteenth
of
july
the
drums
beat
and
the
whole
party
were
drawn
up
under
arms
a
double
line
of
men
extended
from
the
front
of
frontenac
tent
to
the
indian
camp
and
through
the
lane
thus
formed
the
savage
deputies
sixty
in
number
advanced
to
the
place
of
council
they
could
not
hide
their
admiration
at
the
martial
array
of
the
french
many
of
whom
were
old
soldiers
of
the
regiment
of
carignan
and
when
they
reached
the
tent
they
ejaculated
their
astonishment
at
the
uniforms
of
the
governor
guard
who
surrounded
it
here
the
ground
had
been
carpeted
with
the
sails
of
the
flatboats
on
which
the
deputies
squatted
themselves
in
a
ring
and
smoked
their
pipes
for
a
time
with
their
usual
air
of
deliberate
gravity
while
frontenac
who
sat
surrounded
by
his
officers
had
full
leisure
to
contemplate
the
formidable
adversaries
whose
mettle
was
hereafter
to
put
his
own
to
so
severe
a
test
a
chief
named
garakontié
a
noted
friend
of
the
french
at
length
opened
the
council
in
behalf
of
all
the
five
iroquois
nations
with
expressions
of
great
respect
and
deference
towards
onontio
that
is
to
say
the
governor
of
canada
whereupon
frontenac
whose
native
arrogance
where
indians
were
concerned
always
took
a
form
which
imposed
respect
without
exciting
anger
replied
in
the
following
strain
children
mohawks
oneidas
onondagas
cayugas
and
senecas
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
where
i
have
had
a
fire
lighted
for
you
to
smoke
by
and
for
me
to
talk
to
you
you
have
done
well
my
children
to
obey
the
command
of
your
father
take
courage
you
will
hear
his
word
which
is
full
of
peace
and
tenderness
for
do
not
think
that
i
have
come
for
war
my
mind
is
full
of
peace
and
she
walks
by
my
side
courage
then
children
and
take
rest
with
that
he
gave
them
six
fathoms
of
tobacco
reiterated
his
assurances
of
friendship
promised
that
he
would
be
a
kind
father
so
long
as
they
should
be
obedient
children
regretted
that
he
was
forced
to
speak
through
an
interpreter
and
ended
with
a
gift
of
guns
to
the
men
and
prunes
and
raisins
to
their
wives
and
children
here
closed
this
preliminary
meeting
the
great
council
being
postponed
to
another
day
during
the
meeting
raudin
frontenac
engineer
was
tracing
out
the
lines
of
a
fort
after
a
predetermined
plan
and
the
whole
party
under
the
direction
of
their
officers
now
set
themselves
to
construct
it
some
cut
down
trees
some
dug
the
trenches
some
hewed
the
palisades
and
with
such
order
and
alacrity
was
the
work
urged
on
that
the
indians
were
lost
in
astonishment
meanwhile
frontenac
spared
no
pains
to
make
friends
of
the
chiefs
some
of
whom
he
had
constantly
at
his
table
he
fondled
the
iroquois
children
and
gave
them
bread
and
sweetmeats
and
in
the
evening
feasted
the
squaws
to
make
them
dance
the
indians
were
delighted
with
these
attentions
and
conceived
a
high
opinion
of
the
new
onontio
on
the
seventeenth
when
the
construction
of
the
fort
was
well
advanced
frontenac
called
the
chiefs
to
a
grand
council
which
was
held
with
all
possible
state
and
ceremony
his
dealing
with
the
indians
on
this
and
other
occasions
was
truly
admirable
unacquainted
as
he
was
with
them
he
seems
to
have
had
an
instinctive
perception
of
the
treatment
they
required
his
predecessors
had
never
ventured
to
address
the
iroquois
as
children
but
had
always
styled
them
brothers
and
yet
the
assumption
of
paternal
authority
on
the
part
of
frontenac
was
not
only
taken
in
good
part
but
was
received
with
apparent
gratitude
the
martial
nature
of
the
man
his
clear
decisive
speech
and
his
frank
and
downright
manner
backed
as
they
were
by
a
display
of
force
which
in
their
eyes
was
formidable
struck
them
with
admiration
and
gave
tenfold
effect
to
his
words
of
kindness
they
thanked
him
for
that
which
from
another
they
would
not
have
endured
frontenac
began
by
again
expressing
his
satisfaction
that
they
had
obeyed
the
commands
of
their
father
and
come
to
cataraqui
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
then
he
exhorted
them
to
embrace
christianity
and
on
this
theme
he
dwelt
at
length
in
words
excellently
adapted
to
produce
the
desired
effect
words
which
it
would
be
most
superfluous
to
tax
as
insincere
though
doubtless
they
lost
nothing
in
emphasis
because
in
this
instance
conscience
and
policy
aimed
alike
then
changing
his
tone
he
pointed
to
his
officers
his
guard
the
long
files
of
the
militia
and
the
two
flatboats
mounted
with
cannon
which
lay
in
the
river
near
by
if
he
said
your
father
can
come
so
far
with
so
great
a
force
through
such
dangerous
rapids
merely
to
make
you
a
visit
of
pleasure
and
friendship
what
would
he
do
if
you
should
awaken
his
anger
and
make
it
necessary
for
him
to
punish
his
disobedient
children
he
is
the
arbiter
of
peace
and
war
beware
how
you
offend
him
and
he
warned
them
not
to
molest
the
indian
allies
of
the
french
telling
them
sharply
that
he
would
chastise
them
for
the
least
infraction
of
the
peace
from
threats
he
passed
to
blandishments
and
urged
them
to
confide
in
his
paternal
kindness
saying
that
in
proof
of
his
affection
he
was
building
a
storehouse
at
cataraqui
where
they
could
be
supplied
with
all
the
goods
they
needed
without
the
necessity
of
a
long
and
dangerous
journey
he
warned
them
against
listening
to
bad
men
who
might
seek
to
delude
them
by
misrepresentations
and
falsehoods
and
he
urged
them
to
give
heed
to
none
but
men
of
character
like
the
sieur
de
la
salle
he
expressed
a
hope
that
they
would
suffer
their
children
to
learn
french
from
the
missionaries
in
order
that
they
and
his
nephews
meaning
the
french
colonists
might
become
one
people
and
he
concluded
by
requesting
them
to
give
him
a
number
of
their
children
to
be
educated
in
the
french
manner
at
quebec
this
speech
every
clause
of
which
was
reinforced
by
abundant
presents
was
extremely
well
received
though
one
speaker
reminded
him
that
he
had
forgotten
one
important
point
inasmuch
as
he
had
not
told
them
at
what
prices
they
could
obtain
goods
at
cataraqui
frontenac
evaded
a
precise
answer
but
promised
them
that
the
goods
should
be
as
cheap
as
possible
in
view
of
the
great
difficulty
of
transportation
as
to
the
request
concerning
their
children
they
said
that
they
could
not
accede
to
it
till
they
had
talked
the
matter
over
in
their
villages
but
it
is
a
striking
proof
of
the
influence
which
frontenac
had
gained
over
them
that
in
the
following
year
they
actually
sent
several
of
their
children
to
quebec
to
be
educated
the
girls
among
the
ursulines
and
the
boys
in
the
household
of
the
governor
three
days
after
the
council
the
iroquois
set
out
on
their
return
and
as
the
palisades
of
the
fort
were
now
finished
and
the
barracks
nearly
so
frontenac
began
to
send
his
party
homeward
by
detachments
he
himself
was
detained
for
a
time
by
the
arrival
of
another
band
of
iroquois
from
the
villages
on
the
north
side
of
lake
ontario
he
repeated
to
them
the
speech
he
had
made
to
the
others
and
this
final
meeting
over
embarked
with
his
guard
leaving
a
sufficient
number
to
hold
the
fort
which
was
to
be
provisioned
for
a
year
by
means
of
a
convoy
then
on
its
way
up
the
river
passing
the
rapids
safely
he
reached
montreal
on
the
first
of
august
his
enterprise
had
been
a
complete
success
he
had
gained
every
point
and
in
spite
of
the
dangerous
navigation
had
not
lost
a
single
canoe
thanks
to
the
enforced
and
gratuitous
assistance
of
the
inhabitants
the
whole
had
cost
the
king
only
about
ten
thousand
francs
which
frontenac
had
advanced
on
his
own
credit
though
in
a
commercial
point
of
view
the
new
establishment
was
of
very
questionable
benefit
to
the
colony
at
large
the
governor
had
nevertheless
conferred
an
inestimable
blessing
on
all
canada
by
the
assurance
he
had
gained
of
a
long
respite
from
the
fearful
scourge
of
iroquois
hostility
assuredly
he
writes
i
may
boast
of
having
impressed
them
at
once
with
respect
fear
and
footnote
de
frontenac
au
nov
he
adds
that
the
fort
at
cataraqui
with
the
aid
of
a
vessel
now
building
will
command
lake
ontario
keep
the
peace
with
the
iroquois
and
cut
off
the
trade
with
the
english
and
he
proceeds
to
say
that
by
another
fort
at
the
mouth
of
the
niagara
and
another
vessel
on
lake
erie
we
the
french
can
command
all

this
plan
was
an
essential
link
in
the
scheme
of
la
salle
and
we
shall
soon
find
him
employed
in
executing
it
it
remained
to
determine
what
disposition
should
be
made
of
the
new
fort
for
some
time
it
was
uncertain
whether
the
king
would
not
order
its
demolition
as
efforts
had
been
made
to
influence
him
to
that
effect
it
was
resolved
however
that
being
once
constructed
it
should
be
allowed
to
stand
and
after
a
considerable
delay
a
final
arrangement
was
made
for
its
maintenance

the
manner

is
about
to
go
to

who
is
a
man
of
intelligence

ability
more
capable
than
anybody
else
i
know
here
to
accomplish
every
kind
of
enterprise
and
discovery
which
may
be
entrusted
to
him
as
he
has
the
most
perfect
knowledge
of
the
state
of
the
country
as
you
will
see
if
you
are
disposed
to
give
him
a
few
moments
of
audience
he
was
well
received
at
court
and
he
made
two
petitions
to
the
king
the
one
for
a
patent
of
nobility
in
consideration
of
his
services
as
an
explorer
and
the
other
for
a
grant
in
seigniory
of
fort
frontenac
for
so
he
called
the
new
post
in
honor
of
his
patron
on
his
part
he
offered
to
pay
back
the
ten
thousand
francs
which
the
fort
had
cost
the
king
to
maintain
it
at
his
own
charge
with
a
garrison
equal
to
that
of
montreal
besides
fifteen

twenty

to
form
a

colony
around
it
to
build
a

whenever
the
number
of
inhabitants
should
reach
one
hundred

meanwhile
to
support
one
or
more

and
finally
to
form
a

his
offers
were

a
curious
incident
occurred
soon
after
the
building
of
the
fort
on
lake
ontario
a
violent
quarrel
had
taken
place
between
frontenac
and
perrot
the
governor
of
montreal
whom
in
view
of
his
speculations
in
the
trade
he
seems
to
have
regarded
as
a
rival
in
business
but
who
by
his
folly
and
arrogance
would
have
justified
any
reasonable
measure
of
severity
frontenac
however
was
not
reasonable
he
arrested
perrot
threw
him
into
prison
and
set
up
a
man
of
his
own
as
governor
in
his
place
and
as
the
judge
of
montreal
was
not
in
his
interest
he
removed
him
and
substituted
another
on
whom
he
could
rely
thus
for
a
time
he
had
montreal
well
in
hand
the
priests
of
the
seminary
seigneurs
of
the
island
regarded
these
arbitrary
proceedings
with
extreme
uneasiness
they
claimed
the
right
of
nominating
their
own
governor
and
perrot
though
he
held
a
commission
from
the
king
owed
his
place
to
their
appointment
true
he
had
set
them
at
nought
and
proved
a
veritable
king

yet
nevertheless
they
regarded
his
removal
as
an
infringement
of
their
rights

to
be

in
the
house

though
one
of

most
influential
inhabitants
of
the

was
accustomed
to
sell
goods
across
his
counter
in

to
white
men
and
indians
his

taking
his
place
when
he
was

such
were
the
primitive
manners
of
the
secluded
little
colony
le

at
this
time
was
in
the
interest
of
frontenac
and
la

though
he
afterwards
became
one
of
their
most
determined
opponents
amid
the
excitement
and
discussion
occasioned
by

la

declared
himself
an
adherent
of
the
governor
and
warned
all
persons
against
speaking
ill
of
him
in
his
hearing
the
abbé
fénelon
already
mentioned
as
to
the
famous
archbishop
had
attempted
to
mediate
between
frontenac
and
perrot
and
to
this
end
had
made
a
journey
to
quebec
on
the
ice
in
midwinter
being
of
an
ardent
temperament
and
more
courageous
than
prudent
he
had
spoken
somewhat
indiscreetly
and
had
been
very
roughly
treated
by
the
stormy
and
imperious
count
he
returned
to
montreal
greatly
excited
and
not
without
cause
it
fell
to
his
lot
to
preach
the
easter
sermon
the
service
was
held
in
the
little
church
of
the
which
was
crowded
to
the
porch
all
the
chief
persons
of
the

the

the
parish
whose
name
also
was
perrot
said
high
mass
assisted
by
la

brother
cavelier
and
two
other
priests
then
fénelon
mounted
the
pulpit
certain
passages
of
his
sermon
were
obviously
levelled
against
frontenac
speaking
of
the
duties
of
those
clothed
with
temporal
authority
he
said
that
the
magistrate
inspired
with
the
spirit
of
christ
was
as
ready
to
pardon
offences
against
himself
as
to
punish
those
against
his
prince
that
he
was
full
of
respect
for
the
ministers
of
the
altar
and
never
maltreated
them
when
they
attempted
to
reconcile
enemies
and
restore
peace
that
he
never
made
favorites
of
those
who
flattered
him
nor
under
specious
pretexts
oppressed
other
persons
in
authority
who
opposed
his
enterprises
that
he
used
his
power
to
serve
his
king
and
not
to
his
own
advantage
that
he
remained
content
with
his
salary
without
disturbing
the
commerce
of
the
country
or
abusing
those
who
refused
him
a
share
in
their
profits
and
that
he
never
troubled
the
people
by
inordinate
and
unjust
levies
of
men
and
material
using
the
name
of
his
prince
as
a
cover
to
his
own
designs

this

no

speedily

they
made
all

disavow
it

their
letter
to
that

was
the
first
information
which
the

received

the
affair

summoned
the
offender

answer
a
charge
of
seditious
language
before

that
as

ecclesiastic
it
was

right

be

seated
himself

presided

that
a

summoned

was
placed

this
affair
gives
us
a
glimpse
of
the
distracted
state
of
the
colony
racked
by
the
discord
of
conflicting
interests
and
passions
there
were
the
quarrels
of
rival
traders
the
quarrels
of
priests
among
themselves
of
priests
with
the
civil
authorities
and
of
the
civil
authorities
among
themselves
prominent
if
not
paramount
among
the
occasions
of
strife
were
the
schemes
of
cavelier
de
la
salle
all
the
traders
not
interested
with
him
leagued
together
to
oppose
him
and
this
with
an
acrimony
easily
understood
when
it
is
remembered
that
they
depended
for
subsistence
on
the
while
la
salle
had
engrossed
a
great
part
of
it
and
threatened
to
engross
far
more
duchesneau
intendant
of
the
colony
and
in
that
capacity
almost
as
a
matter
of
course
on
ill
terms
with
the
governor

joined
with
this
party
of
opposition
with
whom
he
evidently
had

and
ultimately

besides
various
others

more
or
less
influence

in
the
league
against
la

among
them
was
louis
joliet
whom
his
partisans
put
forward
as
a
rival
discoverer
and
a
foil
to
la
salle
joliet
it
will
be
remembered
had
applied
for
a
grant
of
land
in
the
countries
he
had
discovered
and
had
been
refused
la
salle
soon
after
made
a
similar
application
and
with
a
different
result
as
will
presently
appear
his
adherents
continually
depreciated
the
merits
of
joliet
and
even
expressed
doubt
of
the
reality
or
at
least
the
extent
of
his
discoveries
but
there
was
another
element
of
opposition
to
la
salle
less
noisy
but
not
less
formidable
and
this
arose
from
the
jesuits
frontenac
hated
them
and
they
under
befitting
forms
of
duty
and
courtesy
paid
him
back
in
the
same
coin
having
no
love
for
the
governor
they
would
naturally
have
little
for
his
partisan
and
but
their
opposition
had
another
and
a
deeper
root
for
the
plans
of
the
daring
young
schemer
jarred
with
their
own
we
have
seen
the
canadian
jesuits
in
the
early
apostolic
days
of
their
mission
when
the
flame
of
their
zeal
fed
by
an
ardent
hope
burned
bright
and
high
this
hope
was
doomed
to
disappointment
their
avowed
purpose
of
building
another
paraguay
on
the
borders
of
the
great
lakes
footnote
this
purpose
is
several
times
indicated
in
the
for
an
instance
see
jesuits
in
north
america
was
never
accomplished
and
their
missions
and
their
converts
were
swept
away
in
an
avalanche
of
ruin
still
they
would
not
despair
from
the
lakes
they
turned
their
eyes
to
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
in
the
hope
to
see
it
one
day
the
seat
of
their
new
empire
of
the
faith
but
what
did
this
new
paraguay
mean
it
meant
a
little
nation
of
converted
and
domesticated
savages
docile
as
children
under
the
paternal
and
absolute
rule
of
jesuit
fathers
and
trained
by
them
in
industrial
pursuits
the
results
of
which
were
to
inure
not
to
the
profit
of
the
producers
but
to
the
building
of
churches
the
founding
of
colleges
the
establishment
of
warehouses
and
magazines
and
the
construction
of
works
of
defence
all
controlled
by
jesuits
and
forming
a
part
of
the
vast
possessions
of
the
order
such
was
the
old
paraguay
footnote
compare
charlevoix
de

and
such
we
may
suppose
would
have
been
the
new
had
the
plans
of
those
who
designed
it
been
realized
i
have
said
that
since
the
middle
of
the
century
the
religious
exaltation
of
the
early
missions
had
sensibly
declined
in
the
nature
of
things
that
grand
enthusiasm
was
too
intense
and
fervent
to
be
long
sustained
but
the
vital
force
of
jesuitism
had
suffered
no
diminution
that
marvellous
de
that
extinction
of
self
and
absorption
of
the
individual
in
the
order
which
has
marked
the
jesuits
from
their
first
existence
as
a
body
was
no
whit
changed
or
lessened
a
principle
which
though
different
was
no
less
strong
than
the
patriotism
of
sparta
or
the
early
roman
republic
the
jesuits
were
no
longer
supreme
in
canada
or
in
other
words
canada
was
no
longer
simply
a
mission
it
had
become
a
colony
temporal
interests
and
the
civil
power
were
constantly
gaining
ground
and
the
disciples
of
loyola
felt
that
relatively
if
not
absolutely
they
were
losing
it
they
struggled
vigorously
to
maintain
the
ascendancy
of
their
order
or
as
they
would
have
expressed
it
the
ascendancy
of
religion
but
in
the
older
and
more
settled
parts
of
the
colony
it
was
clear
that
the
day
of
their
undivided
rule
was
past
therefore
they
looked
with
redoubled
solicitude
to
their
missions
in
the
west
they
had
been
among
its
first
explorers
and
they
hoped
that
here
the
catholic
faith
as
represented
by
jesuits
might
reign
with
undisputed
sway
in
paraguay
it
was
their
constant
aim
to
exclude
white
men
from
their
missions
it
was
the
same
in
north
america
they
dreaded
partly
because
they
interfered
with
their
teachings
and
perverted
their
converts
and
partly
for
other
reasons
but
la
salle
was
a
and
far
worse
than
a
he
aimed
at
occupation
fortification
settlement
the
scope
and
vigor
of
his
enterprises
and
the
powerful
influence
that
aided
them
made
him
a
in
their
path
as
they
would
have
put
the
case
it
was
the
spirit
of
this
world
opposed
to
the
spirit
of
religion
but
i
may
perhaps
be
pardoned
if
i
am
constrained
to
think
that
the
spirit
which
inspired
these
fathers
was
not
uniformly
celestial
notwithstanding
the
virtues
which
sometimes
illustrated
it
frontenac
in
his
letters

continually
begging

would

support

their
formidable
rivals

too
wanted
more
récollets

for
the

reason

in
one
point
he
differed
from
his

a
man

of
regulated
life

of
strong
religious
feeling

his
violent
prepossession

attest
thus
in
replying
to
a
charge
of
undue
severity
towards
some

alleges

who
as
he

had
a

de

second
prince
de

i
am
strongly
inclined
to
think
that
this
nobleman
himself
is
author
of
the
memoir
he
says
that
he
had
ten
or
twelve
interviews
with
la

and
becoming
interested
in
him
and
in
that
which
he
communicated
he
wrote
down
the
substance
of
his
conversation
the
paper
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
first
called
mémoire
sur
de
la
salle
is
devoted
to
the
state
of
affairs
in
canada
and
chiefly
to
the
jesuits
the
second
entitled
histoire
de
de
la
salle
is
an
account
of
the
discoverer
life
or
as
much
of
it
as
the
writer
had
learned
from
him
footnote
extracts
from
this
have
already
been
given
in
connection
with
la
salle
supposed
discovery
of
the
mississippi
p
both
parts
bear
throughout
the
internal
evidence
of
being
what
they
profess
to
be
but
they
embody
the
statements
of
a
man
of
intense
partisan
feeling
transmitted
through
the
mind
of
another
person
in
sympathy
with
him
and
evidently
sharing
his
prepossessions
in
one
respect
however
the
paper
is
of
unquestionable
historical
value
for
it
gives
us
a
vivid
and
not
an
exaggerated
picture
of
the
bitter
strife
of
parties
which
then
raged
in
canada
and
which
was
destined
to
tax
to
the
utmost
the
vast
energy
and
fortitude
of
la
salle
at
times
the
memoir
is
fully
sustained
by
contemporary
evidence
but
often
again
it
rests
on
its
own
unsupported
authority
i
give
an
abstract
of
its
statements

i
find
them
the
following
is
the

of

all
those
among
my
friends

have
seen
him
find
in
him
a
man
of
great
intelligence
and
sense
he
rarely
speaks
of
any
subject
except
when
questioned
about
it
and
his
words
are
very
few
and
very
precise
he
distinguishes
perfectly
between
that
which
he
knows
with
certainty
and
that
which
he
knows
with
some
mingling
of
doubt
when
he
does
not
know
he
does
not
hesitate
to
avow
it

though
i
have
heard
him
say
the
same
thing
more
than
five
or
six
times
when
persons
were
present
who
had
not
heard
it
before
he
always
said
it
in
the

never

it
proceeds
to
give
examples
of
the
means
used
by
the
party
opposed
to
him
to
injure
his
good
name
and
bring
him
within
reach
of
the
law
once
when
he
was
at
quebec
the
farmer
of
the
king
revenue
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
place
was
extremely
urgent
in
his
proffers
of
hospitality
and
at
length
though
he
knew
him
but
slightly
persuaded
him
to
lodge
in
his
house

had
been
here
but
a
few
days
when
his
host
wife
began
to
enact
the
part
of
the
wife
of
potiphar
and
this
with
so
much
vivacity
that
on
one
occasion
la
salle
was
forced
to
take
an
abrupt
leave
in
order
to
avoid
an
infringement
of
the
laws
of
hospitality
as
he
opened
the
door
he
found
the
husband
on
the
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
a
plot
to
entrap
him
footnote
this
story
is
told
at
considerable
length
and
the
advances
of
the
lady
particularly
described
another
attack
of
a
different
character
though
in
the
same
direction
was
soon
after
made
the
remittances
which
la
salle
received
from
the
various
members
and
connections
of
his
family
were
sent
through
the
hands
of
his
brother
the
abbé
cavelier
from
whom
his
enemies
were
therefore
very
eager
to
alienate
him
to
this
end
a
report
was
made
to
reach
the
priest
ears
that
la
salle
had
seduced
a
young
woman
with
whom
he
was
living
in
an
open
and
scandalous
manner
at
fort
frontenac
the
effect
of
this
device
exceeded
the
wishes
of
its
contrivers
for
the
priest
aghast
at
what
he
had
heard
set
out
for
the
fort
to
administer
his
fraternal
rebuke
but
on
arriving
in
place
of
the
expected
abomination
found
his
brother
assisted
by
two
récollet
friars
ruling
with
edifying
propriety
over
a
most
exemplary
household
thus
far
the
memoir
from
passages
in
some
of
la
salle
letters
it
may
be
gathered
that
the
abbé
cavelier
gave
him
at
times
no
little
annoyance
in
his
double
character
of
priest
and
elder
brother
he
seems
to
have
constituted
himself
the
counsellor
monitor
and
guide
of
a
man
who
though
many
years
his
junior
was
in
all
respects
incomparably
superior
to
him
as
the
sequel
will
show
this
must
have
been
almost
insufferable
to
a
nature
like
that
of
la
salle
who
nevertheless
was
forced
to
arm
himself
with
patience
since
his
brother
held
the
on
one
occasion
his
forbearance
was
put
to
a
severe
proof
when
wishing
to
marry
a
damsel

good
connections

the
colony

abbé
cavelier
saw
fit
for
some
reason
to
interfere
and
prevented
the
alliance
footnote
letter
of
la

resume
the

declares
that
the
jesuits
procured
an
ordinance
from
the
supreme
council
prohibiting
traders
from
going
into
the
indian
country
in
order
that
they
the
jesuits
being
already
established
there
in
their
missions
might
carry
on

induced
a
good
number
of
the
iroquois
to
settle
around
his
fort
thus
bringing
the
trade
to
his
own
door
without
breaking
the
ordinance
these
iroquois
he
is
farther
reported
to
have
said
were
very
fond
of
him

aided
him
in
rebuilding
the

south
side
of

they
were
established
as
missionaries

was
strengthening
his

he
was
the
bulwark
of
the
country

be
always
on

also
tried
to
persuade
frontenac
that
it
was
necessary
to
raise

prepare
for
war

the

this
check
will
infallibly
be
a
mortification

you
know
how
they
deal
with
whatever
opposes
them
i
am
bound
to
render
them
the
justice
to
say
that
the
poison
which
was
given
me
was
not
at
all

who
was
conscious
of
the
guilt
believing
that
i
was
their
enemy

he
saw
that
our
sentiments
were
opposed
thought
to
exculpate
himself
by
accusing
them
and
i
confess
that
at
the
time
i
was
not
sorry
to
have
this
indication
of
their
but
having
afterwards
carefully
examined
the
affair
i
clearly
discovered
the
falsity
of
the
accusation
which
this
rascal
had
made
against
them
i
nevertheless
pardoned
him
in
order
not
to
give
notoriety
to
the
affair
as
the
mere
suspicion
might
sully
their
reputation
to
which
i
should
scrupulously
avoid
doing
the
slightest
injury
unless
i
thought
it
necessary
to
the
good
of
the
public
and
unless
the

were

asserts
however
that
they
intrigued

to
have
been
the
reduction
of

to
a
number
less
than
that
which

exposing
him

of
his

is
also
stated
to
have
declared

this
agrees
with
expressions
used
by
la
salle
in
a
memoir
addressed
by
him
to
frontenac
in
november
and
printed
by
thomassy
in
this
he
plainly
intimates
his
belief
that
joliet
went
but
little
below
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
and
a
of
the
jesuits

is
a

that
when

was
turned

that
he

on

the

launched
fresh
disasters
a
more
important
work
than
that
of
the
warehouse
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
was
now
to
be
begun
this
was
the
building
of
a
vessel
above
the
cataract
the
small
craft
which
had
brought
la
motte
and
hennepin
with
their
advanced
party
had
been
hauled
to
the
foot
of
the
rapids
at
lewiston
and
drawn
ashore
with
a
capstan
to
save
her
from
the
drifting
ice
her
lading
was
taken
out
and
must
now
be
carried
beyond
the
cataract
to
the
calm
water
above
the
distance
to
the
destined
point
was
at
least
twelve
miles
and
the
steep
heights
above
lewiston
must
first
be
climbed
this
heavy
task
was
accomplished
on
the
of
january
the
level
of
the
plateau
was
reached
and
the
file
of
burdened
men
some
thirty
in
number
toiled
slowly
on
its
way
over
the
snowy
plains
and
through
the
gloomy
forests
of
spruce
and
naked
oak
trees
while
hennepin
plodded
through
the
drifts
with
his
portable
altar
lashed
fast
to
his
back
they
came
at
last
to
the
mouth
of
a
stream
which
entered
the
niagara
two
leagues
above
the
cataract
and
which
was
undoubtedly
that
now
called
cayuga
creek
footnote
it
has
been
a
matter
of
debate
on
which
side
of
the
niagara
the
first
vessel
on
the
upper
lakes
was
built
a
close
study
of
hennepin
and
a
careful
examination
of
the
localities
have
convinced
me
that
the
spot
was
that
indicated
above
hennepin
repeatedly
alludes
to
a
large
detached
rock
rising
out
of
the
water
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
above
lewiston
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
this
rock
may
still
be
seen
immediately
under
the
western
end
of
the
lewiston
persons
living
in
the
neighborhood
remember
that
a
used
to
pass
between
it
and
the
cliffs
of
the
western
shore
but
it
has
since
been
undermined
by
the
current
and
has
inclined
in
that
direction
so
that
a
considerable
part
of
it
is
submerged
while
the
gravel
and
earth
thrown
down
from
the
cliff
during
the
building
of
the
bridge
has
filled
the
intervening
channel
opposite
to
this
rock
and
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
says
hennepin
are
three
mountains
about
two
leagues
below
the
to
these
three
mountains
as
well
as
to
the
rock
he
frequently
alludes
they
are
also
spoken
of
by
la
hontan
who
clearly
indicates
their
position
they
consist
in
the
three
successive
grades
of
the
acclivity
first
that
which
rises
from
the
level
of
the
water
forming
the
steep
and
lofty
river
bank
next
an
intermediate
ascent
crowned
by
a
sort
of
terrace
where
the
tired
men
could
find
a
second
and
lay
down
their
burdens
whence
a
third
effort
carried
them
with
difficulty
to
the
level
top
of
the
plateau
that
this
was
the
actual
portage
or
carrying
place
of
the
travellers
is
shown
by
hennepin
who
describes
the
carrying
of
anchors
and
other
heavy
articles
up
these
heights
in
august
la
hontan
also
passed
the
falls
by
way
of
the
three
mountains
eight
years
la
hontan
it
is
clear
then
that
the
portage
was
on
the
east
side
whence
it
would
be
safe
to
conclude
that
the
vessel
was
built
on
the
same
side
hennepin
says
that
she
was
built
at
the
mouth
of
a
stream
entering
the
niagara
two
leagues
above
the
falls
excepting
one
or
two
small
brooks
there
is
no
stream
on
the
west
side
but
chippewa
creek
which
hennepin
had
visited
and
correctly
placed
at
about
a
league
from
the
cataract
his
distances
on
the
niagara
are
usually
correct
on
the
east
side
there
is
a
stream
which
perfectly
answers
the
conditions
this
is
cayuga
creek
two
leagues
above
the
falls
immediately
in
front
of
it
is
an
island
about
a
mile
long
separated
from
the
shore
by
a
narrow
and
deep
arm
of
the
niagara
into
which
cayuga
creek
discharges
itself
the
place
is
so
obviously
suited
to
building
and
launching
a
vessel
that
in
the
early
part
of
this
century
the
government
of
the
united
states
chose
it
for
the
construction
of
a
schooner
to
carry
supplies
to
the
garrisons
of
the
upper
lakes
the
neighboring
village
now
bears
the
name
of
la

in
examining
this
and
other
localities
on

niagara
i
have
been
greatly
aided
by
my

is
unrivalled

knowledge
of
the

two
mohegan
hunters
attached
to

made
bark
wigwams
to
lodge
the

hennepin
had
his
chapel
apparently
of
the
same
material
where
he
placed
his
altar
and
on
sundays
and
saints
days
said
mass
preached
and
exhorted
while
some
of
the
men
who
knew
the
gregorian
chant
lent
their
aid
at
the
service
when
the
carpenters
were
ready
to
lay
the
keel
of
the
vessel
la
salle
asked
the
friar
to
drive
the
first
bolt
but
the
modesty
of
my
religious
profession
he
says
compelled
me
to
decline
this
honor
fortunately
it
was
the
of
the
iroquois
and
most
of
the
seneca
warriors
were
in
the
forests
south
of
lake
erie
yet
enough
remained
to
cause
serious
uneasiness
they
loitered
sullenly
about
the
place
expressing
their
displeasure
at
the
proceedings
of
the
french
one
of
them
pretending
to
be
drunk
attacked
the
blacksmith
and
tried
to
kill
him
but
the
frenchman
brandishing
a
bar
of
iron
held
him
at
bay
till
hennepin
ran
to
the
rescue
when
as
he
declares
the
severity
of
his
rebuke
caused
the
savage
to
desist

up
at
the
instance
of

intendant

names
of
the
greater
number

are
preserved
these
agree
with
those
given
by

thus
the
whom
he

told

adding
that

the
indians
were
in
perplexity

cut

resolved

four
of
the

that
they
saw
him
approaching
along

margin

his
face
and
hands
were
besmirched
with
charcoal
and
he
was
farther
decorated
with
two
opossums

hung
from
his
belt
and
which
he
had
killed
with
a
stick
as
they
were
swinging

from
the

the

missed
his

forced
to
make
a

circuit
around
the
edge
of
a
swamp
while
the
snow
of
which
the

was
full
added
to
his

he
pushed
on
through

rest
of
the
day
and
the
greater
part
of
the
night
till
about
two
in
the
morning
he
reached
the

again
and
fired
his
gun
as
a
signal
to
his

hearing
no
answering

he
pursued
his
way
along

presently
saw
the
gleam
of
a
fire
among

dense
thickets
close
at

not
doubting
that
he
had
found

hastened

a
heap
of
dry
grass
impressed
with
the
form
of
a
man
who
must
have
fled
but
a
moment
before
for
his
couch
was
still
warm
it
was
no

an
indian
ambushed
on
the
bank
watching
to
kill
some
passing
enemy

called
out
in

there
was

with

was
about

set
the

in

escaped

a
desolate
plain

on
its
farthest
verge
they
could
see
the
lodges

the
miami
indians

had
made
this
place
their

soon
reached
a
spot
where
the
oozy

quaked
beneath

tread
all
around
were
clumps
of
alderbushes
tufts
of
rank
grass

pools

dark
and
lazy
current

might
bestride

was
called

a
name

was
afterwards
corrupted
by

probably
its

as

gave

found

seated
at

took

accuracy

conceiving
that

owed
his
knowledge

way
through
the
spongy
saturated
wilderness
during
three
successive
days
they
were
aware
that
a
party
of
savages
was
dogging
their
tracks
they
dared
not
make
a
fire
at
night
lest
the
light
should
betray
them
but
hanging
their
wet
clothes
on
the
trees
they
rolled
themselves
in
their
blankets
and
slept
together
among
piles
of
spruce
and
pine
boughs
but
the
night
of
the
second
of
april
was
excessively
cold
their
clothes
were
hard
frozen
and
they
were
forced
to
kindle
a
fire
to
thaw
and
dry
them
scarcely
had
the
light
begun
to
glimmer
through
the
gloom
of
evening
than
it
was
greeted
from
the
distance
by
mingled
yells
and
a
troop
of
mascoutin
warriors
rushed
towards
them
they
were
stopped
by
a
deep
stream
a
hundred
paces
from
the
bivouac
of
the
french
and
la
salle
went
forward
to
meet
them
no
sooner
did
they
see
him
and
learn
that
he
was
a
frenchman
than
they
cried
that
they
were
friends
and
brothers
who
had
mistaken
him
and
his
men
for
iroquois
and
abandoning
their
hostile
purpose
they
peacefully
withdrew
thus
his
device
to
avert
danger
had
proved
the
destruction
of
the
whole
party
two
days
after
this
adventure
two
of
the
men
fell
ill
from
fatigue
and
exposure
and
sustained
themselves
with
difficulty
till
they
reached
the
banks
of
a
river
probably
the

while
the
sick
men
rested
their
companions
made
a
canoe
there
were
no
and
they
were
forced
to
use
elm
bark
which
at
that
early
season
would
not
slip
freely
from
the
wood
until
they
loosened
it
with
hot
water
their
canoe
being
made
they
embarked
in
it
and
for
a
time
floated
prosperously
down
the
stream
when
at
length
the
way
was
barred
by
a
matted
barricade
of
trees
fallen
across
the
water
the
sick
men
could
now
walk
again
and

eastward
through
the
forest

the

of

his
friend
therefore
if
alive
was
probably
still
at

mind
lightened
in
some
small
measure

load

had
passed
here
all
was
solitude
but
how
the
scene
was
changed
the
boundless
waste
was
thronged
with
life
he
beheld
that
wondrous
spectacle
still
to
be
seen
at
times
on
the
plains
of
the
remotest
west

the
memory

opportunity
not

for

sometimes
they
hid
under

shelving
bank

shot
them

themselves

i
have
a
very
vivid
recollection
of
the
appearance
of
an
old
buffalo
bull
under
such
circumstances
when
i
was
within
a
hundred
yards
of
him
he
came
towards
me
at
a
sharp
trot
as
if
to
make
a
charge
but
as
i
remained
motionless
he
stopped
thirty
paces
off
and
stared
fixedly
for
a
long
time
at
length
he
slowly
turned
and
in
doing
so
received
a
shot
behind
the
shoulder
which
killed
him
it
is
useless
to
fire
at
the
forehead
of
a
buffalo
bull
at
least
with
an
ordinary
rifle
as
the
bullet
flattens
against
his
skull
a
shot
at
close
quarters
just
above
the
nose
would
probably
turn
him
in
a
charge
the
usual
modes
of
hunting
buffalo
on
foot
are
those
mentioned
above
they
are
commonly
successful
but
at
times
the
animals
are
excessively
shy
and
wary
while
at
other
times
they
are
stupid
beyond
measure
and
can
be
easily
approached
and
killed
the
hunter
must
remain
perfectly
motionless
after
firing
as
the
wounded
animal
is
apt
to
make
a
rush
at
him
if
he
moves
the
most
agreeable
mode
of
hunting
buffalo
is
however
on
horseback
running
alongside
of
them
and
shooting
them
behind
the
shoulder
with
a
pistol
or
a
short
gun
a
bow
and
arrow
are
better
for
those
who
know
how
to
use
them
but
white
men
very
rarely
have
the
skill
i
have
seen
on
different
occasions
several
hundred
buffalo
killed
with
arrows
by
indians
on
horseback
this
noble
game
with
the
tribes
who
live
on
it
will
soon
disappear
from
the
earth
the
hunt
was
successful
in
three
days
the
hunters
killed
twelve
buffalo
besides
deer
geese
and
swans
they
cut
the
meat
into
thin
flakes
and
dried
it
in
the
sun
or
in
the
smoke
of
their
fires
the
men
were
in
high
spirits
delighting
in
the
sport
and
rejoicing
in
the
prospect
of
relieving
tonty
and
his
hungry
followers
with
a
bounteous
supply
they
embarked
again
and
soon
approached
the
great
town
of
the
illinois
the
buffalo
were
far
behind
and
once
more
the
canoes
glided
on
their
way
through
a
voiceless
solitude
no
hunters
were
seen
no
saluting
whoop
greeted
their
ears
they
passed
the
cliff
afterwards
called
the
rock
of
louis
where
la
salle
had
ordered
tonty
to
build
his
stronghold
but
as
he
scanned
its
lofty
top
he
saw
no
palisades
no
cabins
no
sign
of
human
hand
and
still
its
primeval
crest
of
forests
overhung
the
gliding
river
now
the
meadow
opened
before
them
where
the
great
town
had
stood
they
gazed
astonished
and
confounded
all
was
desolation
the
town
had
vanished
and
the
meadow
was
black
with
fire
they
plied
their
paddles
hastened
to
the
spot
landed
and
as
they
looked
around
their
cheeks
grew
white
and
the
blood
was
frozen
in
their
veins
before
them
lay
a
plain
once
swarming
with
wild
human
life
and
covered
with
indian
dwellings
now
a
waste
of
devastation
and
death
strewn
with
heaps
of
ashes
and
bristling
with
the
charred
poles
and
stakes
which
had
formed
the
framework
of
the
lodges
at
the

of
most
of

most
of

were
ripe
for
mutiny
they
had
no
interest
in
the
enterprise
and
no
love
for
its
chief
they
were
disgusted
at
the
present
and
terrified
at
the
future
la
salle
too
was
for
the
most
part
a
stern
commander
impenetrable
and
cold
and
when
he
tried
to
soothe
conciliate
and
encourage
his
success
rarely
answered
to
the
excellence
of
his
rhetoric
he
could
always
however
inspire
respect
if
not

told

seized
by
the
creditors
of

that
he
was
ruined

that

the

would
never

their

their
wages
were
in

for
more
than
two
years
and
indeed
it
would
have
been
folly
to
pay
them
before
their
return
to
the

to
do
so
would
have
been
a

to
desert
now

reached
them

their
enemies
appeared
at

edge

on
the
opposite
bank
many
found
means
to
cross
and
under
the
pretext
of
seeking
for
provisions
began
to
hover
in
bands
about
the
skirts
of
the
town
constantly
increasing
in
numbers
had
the
illinois
dared
to
remain
a
massacre
would
doubtless
have

they
knew
their

embarked
in
haste
and
paddled
down
the
stream
to
rejoin
their
women
and
children
at
the
sanctuary
among
the
morasses
the
whole
body
of
the
iroquois
now
crossed
the
river
took
possession
of
the
abandoned
town
building
for
themselves
a
rude
redoubt

the
trunks

and
of
the
posts

poles
forming
the
framework
of
the

escaped
the
fire
here
they
ensconced
themselves
and
finished
the
work
of
havoc
at
their
leisure
tonty
and
his
companions
still
occupied
their
hut
but
the
iroquois
becoming
suspicious
of

forced
them
to
remove
to
the
fort
crowded
as
it
was
with
the
savage
crew
on
the
second
day
there
was
an
alarm
the
illinois
appeared
in
numbers
on
the
low
hills
half
a
mile
behind
the
town
and
the
iroquois
who
had
felt
their
courage
and
who
had
been
told
by
tonty
that
they
were
twice
as
numerous
as
themselves
showed
symptoms
of
no
little
uneasiness
they
proposed
that
he
should
act
as
mediator
to
which
he
gladly
assented
and
crossed
the
meadow
towards
the
illinois
accompanied
by
membré
and
by
an
iroquois
who
was
sent
as
a
hostage
the
illinois
hailed
the
overtures
with
delight
gave
the
ambassadors
some
refreshment
which
they
sorely
needed
and
sent
back
with
them
a
young
man
of
their
nation
as
a
hostage
on
their
part
this
indiscreet
youth
nearly
proved
the
ruin
of
the
negotiation
for
he
was
no
sooner
among
the
iroquois
than
he
showed
such
an
eagerness
to
close
the
treaty
made
such
promises
professed
such
gratitude
and
betrayed
so
rashly
the
numerical
weakness
of
the
illinois
that
he
revived
all
the
insolence
of
the
invaders
they
turned
furiously
upon
tonty
and
charged
him
with
having
robbed
them
of
the
glory
and
the
spoils
of
victory
where
are
all
your
illinois
warriors
and
where
are
the
sixty
frenchmen
that
you
said
were
among
them
it
needed
all
tonty
tact
and
coolness
to
extricate
himself
from
this
new
danger
the
treaty
was
at
length
concluded
but
scarcely
was
it
made
when
the
iroquois
prepared
to
break
it
and
set
about
constructing
canoes
of
bark
in
which
to
attack
the
illinois
women
and
children
in
their
island
sanctuary
tonty
warned
his
allies
that
the
pretended
peace
was
but
a
snare
for
their
destruction
the
iroquois
on
their
part
grew
hourly
more
jealous
of
him

would
certainly
have
killed
him

it
not
been
their
policy
to
keep
the
peace
with
frontenac

the
french
several
days
after
they
summoned
him
and
membré
to
a
council
six
packs
of
beaver
skin
were
brought
in
and
the
savage
orator
presented
them
to
tonty
in
turn
explaining
their
meaning
as
he
did
so
the
first
two
were
to
declare
that
the
children
of
count
frontenac
that
is
the
illinois
should
not
be
eaten

next
was
a
plaster

next
was

wherewith
to
anoint
him
and

they
might
not
be
fatigued
in
travelling
the
next
proclaimed
that
the
sun
was

sixth
and

required
them
to
decamp
and
go
home

speech

will
be

conclave
grew
angry
and
despite
their

said

would

kicked

children

would
have
none

the
chiefs
in
a
rage
rose
and
drove
him
from
the
lodge
the
french
withdrew
to
their
hut
where
they
stood
all
night
on
the
watch
expecting
an
attack

sell
their
lives
dearly

it
unwise
to
persist
farther
in
a
course
which
could
lead
to
no
good
and
which
would
probably
end
in
the
destruction
of
the
whole
party

embarked
in
a
leaky
canoe
with

and
the

to

by

bank

lay
watching
it

side
at
midnight

saw

hovering
around

bears
every
evidence

certainly

by

the
of
tonty
is
wholly
distinct
it
is
a
modest
and
simple
statement
of
which
the
chief
fault
is
its
brevity
he
undoubtedly
wrote
another
and
more
detailed
narrative

has
been
used

for

to
trace
the
strange
adventures
of
the
errant
friar
father
louis
hennepin
the
illinois
town
the
site
of
the
great
illinois
this
has
not
till
now
been
determined
though
there
have
been
various
conjectures
concerning
it
from
a
study
of
the
contemporary
documents
and
maps
i
became
satisfied
first
that
the
branch
of
the
river
illinois
called
the
big
vermilion
was
the
of
the
french
explorers
and
secondly
that
the
cliff
called
starved
rock
was
that
known
to
the
french
as
or
the
rock
of
louis
if
i
was
right
in
this
conclusion
then
the
position
of
the
great
village
was
established
for
there
is
abundant
proof
that
it
was
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
above
the
aramoni
and
below
le
rocher
i
accordingly
went
to
the
village
of
utica
which
as
i
judged
by
the
map
was
very
near
the
point
in
question
and
mounted
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
hills
immediately
behind
it
whence
i
could
see
the
valley
of
the
illinois
for
miles
bounded
on
the
farther
side
by
a
range
of
hills
in
some
parts
rocky
and
precipitous
and
in
others
covered
with
forests
far
on
the
right
was
a
gap
in
these
hills
through
which
the
big
vermilion
flowed
to
join
the
illinois
and
somewhat
towards
the
left
at
the
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
was
a
huge
cliff
rising
perpendicularly
from
the
opposite
margin
of
the
river
this
i
assumed
to
be
of
the
french
though
from
where
i
stood
i
was
unable
to
discern
the
distinctive
features
which
i
was
prepared
to
find
in
it
in
every
other
respect
the
scene
before
me
was
precisely
what
i
had
expected
to
see
there
was
a
meadow
on
the
hither
side
of
the
river
on
which
stood
a
and
this
as
it
seemed
to
me
by
its
relations
with
surrounding
objects
might
be
supposed
to
stand
in
the
midst
of
the
space
once
occupied
by
the
illinois
town
on
the
way
down
from
the
hill
i
met
james
clark
the
principal
inhabitant
of
utica
and
one
of
the
earliest
settlers
of
this
region
i
accosted
him
told
him
my
objects
and
requested
a
half
conversation
with
him
at
his
leisure
he
seemed
interested
in
the
inquiry
and
said
he
would
visit
me
early
in
the
evening
at
the
inn
where
accordingly
he
soon
appeared
the
conversation
took
place
in
the
porch
where
a
number
of
farmers
and
others
were
gathered
i
asked
clark
if
any
indian
remains
were
found
in
the
neighborhood
yes
he
replied
plenty
of
them
i
then
inquired
if
there
was
any
one
spot
where
they
were
more
numerous
than
elsewhere
yes
he
answered
again
pointing
towards
the
on
the
meadow
on
my
farm
down
yonder
by
the
river
my
tenant
ploughs
up
teeth
and
bones
by
the
peck
every
spring
besides
beads
stone
hatchets
and
other
things
of
that
sort
i
replied
that
this
was
precisely
what
i
had
expected
as
i
had
been
led
to
believe
that
the
principal
town
of
the
illinois
indians
once
covered
that
very
spot
if
i
added
i
am
right
in
this
belief
the
great
rock
beyond
the
river
is
the
one
which
the
first
explorers
occupied
as
a
fort
and
i
can
describe
it
to
you
from
their
accounts
of
it
though
i
have
never
seen
it
except
from
the
top
of
the
hill
where
the
trees
on
and
around
it
prevented
me
from
seeing
any
part
but
the
front
the
men
present
now
gathered
around
to
listen
the
rock
i
continued
is
nearly
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
high
and
rises
directly
from
the
water
the
front
and
two
sides
are
perpendicular
and
inaccessible
but
there
is
one
place
where
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
climb
up
though
with
difficulty
the
top
is
large
enough
and
level
enough
for
houses
and
fortifications
here
several
of
the
men
exclaimed
that
just
it
you
hit
it
exactly
i
then
asked
if
there
was
any
other
rock
on
that
side
of
the
river
which
could
answer
to
the
description
they
all
agreed
that
there
was
no
such
rock
on
either
side
along
the
whole
length
of
the
river
i
then
said
if
the
indian
town
was
in
the
place
where
i
suppose
it
to
have
been
i
can
tell
you
the
nature
of
the
country
which
lies
behind
the
hills
on
the
farther
side
of
the
river
though
i
know
nothing
about
it
except
what
i
have
learned
from
writings
nearly
two
centuries
old
from
the
top
of
the
hills
you
look
out
upon
a
great
prairie
reaching
as
far
as
you
can
see
except
that
it
is
crossed
by
a
belt
of
woods
following
the
course
of
a
stream
which
enters
the
main
river
a
few
miles
below
see
you
are
exactly
right
again
replied
clark
we
call
that
belt
of
timber
the
woods
and
the
stream
is
the
big
vermilion
then
i
said
the
big
vermilion
is
the
river
which
the
french
called
the
aramoni
rock
is
the
same
on
which
they
built
a
fort
called
louis
in
the
year
and
your
farm
is
on
the
site
of
the
great
town
of
the
illinois
i
spent
the
next
day
in
examining
these
localities
and
was
fully
confirmed
in
my
conclusions
clark
tenant
showed
me
the
spot
where
the
human
bones
were
ploughed
up
it
was
no
doubt
the
graveyard
violated
by
the
iroquois
the
illinois
returned
to
the
village
after
their
defeat
and
long
continued
to
occupy
it
the
scattered
bones
were
probably
collected
and
restored
to
their
place

burial

he
exposed

prevent
them
from
making

what
they
had
seen
and
thereby
crossing
his
secret
plans
i
was
certain
that
if
i
went
down
the
mississippi
he
would
not
fail
to
traduce
me
to
my
superiors
for
not
taking
the
northern

i
was
to
have
followed
in

had
made
together

myself
on

dying

knew
not
what
to
do

were

threatened
openly
to
leave
me
in

night

carry
off
the
canoe

thing
in

if
i
prevented
them
from
going
down

finding
myself
in

thought

i

himself

from

him

down
to

returned
to

set
out

the

him

for

this
book
was
suppressed
by
the
french
government
but
a
few
copies
fortunately
survived
one
of
these
is
now
before
me
it
contains
the
journal
of
father
zenobe
membré
on
his
descent
of
the
mississippi
in
in
company
with
la
salle
the
slightest
comparison
of
his
narrative
with
that
of
hennepin
is
sufficient
to
show
that
the
latter
framed
his
own
story
out
of
incidents
and
descriptions
furnished
by
his
brother
missionary
often
using
his
very
words
and
sometimes
copying
entire
pages
with
no
other
alterations
than
such
as
were
necessary
to
make
himself
instead
of
la
salle
and
his
companions
the
hero
of
the

the

of

piracy
may
be
searched
in

an

hennepin
may
have
copied
from
the
unpublished
journal
of
membré
which
the
latter
had
placed
in
the
hands
of
his
superior
or
he
may
have
compiled
from
le
clercq
book
relying
on
the
suppression
of
the
edition
to
prevent
detection
he
certainly
saw
and
used
it
for
he
elsewhere
borrows
the
exact
words
of
the
editor
he
is
so
careless
that
he
steals
from
membré
passages
which
he
might
easily
have
written
for
himself
as
for
example
a
description
of
the
opossum
and
another
of
the
cougar
animals
with
which
he
was

cited
above

in

editions
he
stole
largely
from

such
being
the
case
what
faith
can
we
put
in
the
rest
of
story
fortunately
there
are
tests
by
which
the
earlier
parts
of
his
book
can
be
tried
and
on
the
whole
they
square
exceedingly
well
with
contemporary
records
of
undoubted
authenticity
bating
his
exaggerations
respecting
the
falls
of
niagara
his
local
descriptions
and
even
his
estimates
of
distance
are
generally
accurate
he
constantly
it
is
true
magnifies
his
own
acts
and
thrusts
himself
forward
as
one
of
the
chiefs
of
an
enterprise
to
the
costs
of
which
he
had
contributed
nothing
and
to
which
he
was
merely
an
appendage
and
yet
till
he
reaches
the
mississippi
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
the
main
he
tells
the
truth
as
for
his
ascent
of
that
river
to
the
country
of
the
sioux
the
general
statement
is
fully
confirmed
by
allusions
of
tonty
and
other
contemporary
writers
footnote
it
is
certain
that
persons
having
the
best
means
of
information
believed
at
the
time
in
hennepin
story
of
his
journeys
on
the
upper
mississippi
the
compiler
of
the
des
who
was
in
close
relations
with
la
salle
and
those
who
acted
with
him
does
not
intimate
a
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
report
which
hennepin
on
his
return
gave
to
the
provincial
commissary
of
his
order
and
which
is
in
substance
the
same
which
he
published
two
years
later
the
it
is
to
be
observed
was
written
only
a
few
months
after
the
return
of
hennepin
and
embodies
the
pith
of
his
narrative
of
the
upper
mississippi
no
part
of
which
had
then
been
published
for
the
details
of
the
journey
we
must
look
on
hennepin
alone
whose
account
of
the
company
and
of
the
peculiar
traits
of
its
indian
occupation
afford
as
far
as
they
go
good
evidence
of
truth
indeed
this
part
of
his
narrative
could
only
have
been
written
by
one
well
versed
in
the
savage
life
of
this
region
footnote
in
this
connection
it
is
well
to
examine
the
various
sioux
words
which
hennepin
uses
incidentally
and
which
he
must
have
acquired
by
personal
intercourse
with
the
tribe
as
no
frenchman
then
understood
the
language
these
words
as
far
as
my
information
reaches
are
in
every
instance
correct
thus
he
says
that
the
sioux
called
his
breviary
a
bad
spirit
or
would
express
the
same
meaning
in
modern
english
spelling
he
says
elsewhere
that
they
called
the
guns
of
his
companions
which
he
translates
iron
possessed
with
a
bad
spirit
the
western
sioux
to
this
day
call
a
gun
metal
possessed
with
a
spirit
shonka
a
dog
wahsee
a
shinnan
a
robe
or
garment
and
other
words
are
given
correctly
with
their
interpretations
the
word
affirmed
by
hennepin
to
mean
the
sun
seems
at
first
sight
a
wilful
inaccuracy
as
this
is
not
the
word
used
in
general
by
the
sioux
the
yankton
band
of
this
people
however
call
the
sun
which
it
is
evident
represents
the
french
pronunciation
of
louis
omitting
the
initial
letter
this
hennepin
would
be
apt
enough
to
supply
thereby
conferring
a
compliment
alike
on
himself
louis
hennepin
and
on
the
king
louis
who
to
the
indignation
of
his
brother
monarchs
had
chosen
the
sun
as
his
emblem
a
variety
of
trivial
incidents
touched
upon
by
hennepin
while
recounting
his
life
among
the
sioux
seem
to
me
to
afford
a
strong
presumption
of
an
actual
experience
i
speak
on
this
point
with
the
more
confidence
as
the
indians
in
whose
lodges
i
was
once
domesticated
for
several
weeks
belonged
to
a
western
band
of
the
same
people
trusting
then
to
his
guidance
in
the
absence
of
better
let
us
follow
in
the
wake
of
his
adventurous
canoe
it
was
laden
deeply
with
goods
belonging
to
la
salle
and
meant
by
handing
presents
to
indians
on
the
way
though
the
travelers
it
appears
proposed
to
use
them
in
trading
of
their
own
account
the
friar
was
still
wrapped
in
his
gray
capote
and
hood
shod
with
sandals
and
decorated
with
the
cord
of
francis

for
his
two

tolerably
clear
that
the

was
the
real
leader
of
the
party

hennepin
after
his
custom
thrusts
himself
into
the
foremost
place
both
were
somewhat
above
the

they
fared
sumptuously

were
exemplary

their
devotions

said
prayers
at

a
petition
to
anthony
of

that
he
would
save
them
from
the
peril
that
beset
their
way

there
was
a
lion
in
the
path
the
ferocious
character
of
the
sioux
or
dacotah
who
occupied
the
region
of
the
upper
mississippi
was
already
known
to
the
french
and
hennepin
not
without
reason
prayed
that
it
might
be
his
fortune
to
meet
them
not
by
night
but
by
day
on
the
eleventh
or
twelfth
of

they
stopped
in
the
afternoon
to
repair
their
canoe
and
hennepin
busied
himself
in
daubing
it
with
pitch
while
the
others
cooked
a
turkey
suddenly
a
fleet
of
sioux
canoes
swept
into
sight
bearing
a
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
naked
savages
who
on
seeing
the
travellers
raised
a
hideous
clamor
and
some
leaping
ashore
and
others
into
the
water
they
surrounded
the
astonished
frenchmen
in
an
instant

detail
than
the
former
hennepin
held
out
the
but
one
of
them
snatched
it
from
him
next
he
hastened
to
proffer
a
gift
of
martinique
tobacco
which
was
better
received
some
of
the
old
warriors
repeated
the
name
giving
him
to
understand
that
they
were
a
on
the
way
to
attack
the
miamis
on
which
hennepin
with
the
help
of
signs
and
of
marks
which
he
drew
on
the
sand
with
a
stick
explained
that
the
miamis
had
gone
across
the
mississippi
beyond
their
reach
hereupon
he
says
that
three
or
four
old
men
placed
their
hands
on
his
head
and
began
a
dismal
wailing
while
he
with
his
handkerchief
wiped
away
their
tears
in
order
to
evince
sympathy
with
their
affliction
from
whatever
cause
arising
notwithstanding
this
demonstration
of
tenderness
they
refused
to
smoke
with
him
in
his
and
forced
him
and
his
companions
to
embark
and
paddle
across
the
river
while
they
all
followed
behind
uttering
yells
and
howlings
which
froze
the
missionary
blood

reaching
the
farther
side

made

their
prisoners
to

slung
their
kettle
while
hennepin
to
propitiate
the
sioux
carried
to
them
two
turkeys
of
which
there
were
several
in
the
canoe
the
warriors
had
seated
themselves
in
a
ring
to
debate
on
the
fate
of
the
frenchmen
and
two
chiefs
presently
explained
to
the
friar
by
significant
signs
that
it
had
been
resolved
that
his
head
should
be
split
with
a
this
produced
the
effect
which
was
no
doubt
intended
hennepin
ran
to
the
canoe
and
quickly
returned
with
one
of
the
men
both
loaded
with
presents
which
he
threw
into
the
midst
of
the
assembly
and
then
bowing
his
head
offered
them
at
the
same
time
a
hatchet
with
which
to
kill
him
if
they
wished
to
do
so
his
gifts
and
his
submission
seemed
to
appease
them
they
gave
him
and
his
companions
a
dish
of
beaver
flesh
but
to
his
great
concern
they
returned
his
an
act
which
he
interpreted
as
a
sign
of
danger
that
night
the
frenchmen
slept
little
expecting
to
be
murdered
before
morning
there
was
in
fact
a
great
division
of
opinion
among
the
sioux
some
were
for
killing
them
and
taking
their
goods
while
others
eager
above
all
things
that
french
traders
should
come
among
them
with
the
knives
hatchets
and
guns
of
which
they
had
heard
the
value
contended
that
it
would
be
impolitic
to
discourage
the
trade
by
putting
to
death
its
pioneers
scarcely
had
morning
dawned
on
the
anxious
captives
when
a
young
chief
naked
and
painted
from
head
to
foot
appeared
before
them
and
asked
for
the
pipe
which
the
friar
gladly
gave
him
he
filled
it
smoked
it
made
the
warriors
do
the
same
and
having
given
this
hopeful
pledge
of
amity
told
the
frenchmen
that
since
the
miamis
were
out
of
reach
the
would
return
home
and
that
they
must
accompany
them
to
this
hennepin
gladly
agreed
having
as
he
declares
his
great
work
of
exploration
so
much
at
heart
that
he
rejoiced
in
the
prospect
of
achieving
it
even
in
their
company
he
soon
however
had
a
foretaste
of
the
affliction
in
store
for
him
for
when
he
opened
his
breviary
and
began
to
mutter
his
morning
devotion
his
new
companions
gathered
about
him
with
faces
that
betrayed
their
superstitious
terror
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
book
was
a
bad
spirit
with
which
he
must
hold
no
more
converse
they
thought
indeed
that
he
was
muttering
a
charm
for
their
destruction
accau
and
du
gay
conscious
of
the
danger
begged
the
friar
to
dispense
with
his
devotions
lest
he
and
they
alike
should
be
tomahawked
but
hennepin
says
that
his
sense
of
duty
rose
superior
to
his
fears
and
that
he
was
resolved
to
repeat
his
office
at
all
hazards
though
not
until
he
had
asked
pardon
of
his
two
friends
for
thus
imperilling
their
lives
fortunately
he
presently
discovered
a
device
by
which
his
devotion
and
his
prudence
were
completely
reconciled
he
ceased
the
muttering
which
had
alarmed
the
indians
and
with
the
breviary
open
on
his
knees
sang
the
service
in
loud
and
cheerful
tones
as
this
had
no
savor
of
sorcery
and
as
they
now
imagined
that
the
book
was
teaching
its
owner
to
sing
for
their
amusement
they
conceived
a
favorable
opinion
of
both
alike
these
sioux
it
may
be
observed
were
the
ancestors
of
those
who
committed
the
horrible
but
not
unprovoked
massacres
of
in
the
valley
of
the
peter
hennepin
complains
bitterly
of
their
treatment
of
him
which
however
seems
to
have
been
tolerably
good
afraid
that
he
would
lag
behind
as
his
canoe
was
heavy
and
slow
footnote
and
yet
it
had
by
his
account
made
a
distance
of
thirteen
hundred
and
eighty
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
upward
in
days
they
placed
several
warriors
in
it
to
aid
him
and
his
men
in
paddling
they
kept
on
their
way
from
morning
till
night
building
huts
for
their
bivouac
when
it
rained
and
sleeping
on
the
open
ground
when
the
weather
was
fair
which
says
hennepin
gave
us
a
good
opportunity
to
contemplate
the
moon
and
stars
the
three
frenchmen
took
the
precaution
of
sleeping
at
the
side
of
the
young
chief
who
had
been
the
first
to
smoke
the
peacepipe
and
who
seemed
inclined
to
befriend
them
but
there
was
another
chief
one
aquipaguetin
a
crafty
old
savage
who
having
lost
a
son
in
war
with
the
miamis
was
angry
that
the
party
had
abandoned
their
expedition
and
thus
deprived
him
of
his
revenge
he
therefore
kept
up
a
dismal
lament
through
half
the
night
while
other
old
men
crouching
over
hennepin
as
he
lay
trying
to
sleep
stroked
him
with
their
hands
and
uttered
wailings
so
lugubrious
that
he
was
forced
to
the
belief
that
he
had
been
doomed
to
death
and
that
they
were
charitably
bemoaning
his
fate
footnote
this
weeping
and
wailing
over
hennepin
once
seemed
to
me
an
anomaly
in
his
account
of
sioux
manners
as
i
am
not
aware
that
such
practices
are
to
be
found
among
them
at
present
they
are
mentioned
however
by
other
early
writers
le
sueur
who
was
among
them
in
was
wept
over
no
less
than
hennepin
see
the
abstract
of
his
journal
in
la
harpe
one
night
they
were
for
some
reason
unable
to
bivouac
near
their
protector
and
were
forced
to
make
their
fire
at
the
end
of
the
camp
here
they
were
soon
beset
by
a
crowd
of
indians
who
told
them
that
aquipaguetin
had
at
length
resolved
to
tomahawk
them
the
malcontents
were
gathered
in
a
knot
at
a
little
distance
and
hennepin
hastened
to
appease
them
by
another
gift
of
knives
and
tobacco
this
was
but
one
of
the
devices
of
the
old
chief
to
deprive
them
of
their
goods
without
robbing
them
outright
he
had
with
him
the
bones
of
a
deceased
relative
which
he
was
carrying
home
wrapped
in
skins
prepared
with
smoke
after
the
indian
fashion
and
gayly
decorated
with
bands
of
dyed
porcupine
quills
he
would
summon
his
warriors
and
placing
these
relics
in
the
midst
of
the
assembly
call
on
all
present
to
smoke
in
their
honor
after
which
hennepin
was
required
to
offer
a
more
substantial
tribute
in
the
shape
of
cloth
beads
hatchets
tobacco
and
the
like
to
be
laid
upon
the
bundle
of
bones
the
gifts
thus
acquired
were
then
in
the
name
of
the
deceased
distributed
among
the
persons
present
on
one
occasion
aquipaguetin
killed
a
bear
and
invited
the
chiefs
and
warriors
to
feast
upon
it
they
accordingly
assembled
on
a
prairie
west
of
the
river
and
the
banquet
over
they
danced
a
they
were
all
painted
from
head
to
foot
with
their
hair
oiled
garnished
with
red
and
white
feathers
and
powdered
with
the
down
of
birds
in
this
guise
they
set
their
arms
akimbo
and
fell
to
stamping
with
such
fury
that
the
hard

with
the
prints
of
their
moccasons
while
the
chief
son
crying
at
the
top
of
his
throat
gave
to
each
in
turn
the
pipe
of
war
meanwhile
the
chief
himself
singing
in
a
loud
and
rueful
voice
placed
his
hands
on
the
heads
of
the
three
frenchmen
and
from
time
to
time
interrupted
his
music
to
utter
a
vehement
harangue
hennepin
could
not
understand
the
words
but
his
heart
sank
as
the
conviction
grew
strong
within
him
that
these
ceremonies
tended
to
his
destruction
it
seems
however
that
after
all
the
chief
efforts
his
party
was
in
the
minority
the
greater
part
being
averse
to
either
killing
or
robbing
the
three
strangers
every
morning
at
daybreak
an
old
warrior
shouted
the
signal
of
departure
and
the
recumbent
savages
leaped
up
manned
their
birchen
fleet
and
plied
their
paddles
against
the
current
often
without
waiting
to
break
their
fast
sometimes
they
stopped
for
a
on
the
neighboring
prairies
and
there
was
no
lack
of
provisions
they
passed
lake
pepin
which
hennepin
called
the
lake
of
tears
by
reason
of
the
howlings
and
lamentations
here
uttered
over
him
by
aquipaguetin
and
nineteen
days
after
his
capture
landed
near
the

the

broke
his
canoe
to
pieces
having
first
hidden
their
own
among
the
as
they
belonged
to
different
bands
and
different
villages
their
mutual
jealousy
now
overcame
all
their
prudence
and
each
proceeded
to
claim
his
share
of
the
captives
and
the
booty
happily
they
made
an
amicable
distribution
or
it
would
have
fared
ill
with
the
three
frenchmen
and
each
taking
his
share
not
forgetting
the
priestly
vestments
of
hennepin
the
splendor
of
which
they
could
not
sufficiently
admire
they
set
out
across
the
country
for
their
villages
which
lay
towards
the
north
in
the
neighborhood
of
lake
buade
now
called
mille

being
says
hennepin
exceedingly
tall
and
active
they
walked
at
a
prodigious
speed
insomuch
that
no
european
could
long
keep
pace
with
them
though
the
month
of
may
had
begun
there
were
frosts
at
night
and
the
marshes
and
ponds
were
glazed
with
ice
which
cut
the
legs
as
he
waded
through
they
swam
the
larger
streams
and
hennepin
nearly
perished
with
cold
as
be
emerged
from
the
icy
current
his
two
companions
who
were
smaller
than
he
and
who
could
not
swim
were
carried
over
on
the
backs
of
the
indians
they
showed
however
no
little
endurance
and
he
declares
that
he
should
have
dropped
by
the
way
but
for
their
support
seeing
him
disposed
to
lag
the
indians
to
spur
him
on
set
fire
to
the
dry
grass
behind
him
and
then
taking
him
by
the
hands
ran
forward
with
him
to
escape
the
flames
to
add
to
his
misery
he
was
nearly
famished
as
they
gave
him
only
a
small
piece
of
smoked
meat
once
a
day
though
it
does
not
appear
that
they
themselves
fared
better
on
the
fifth
day
being
by
this
time
in
extremity
he
saw
a
crowd
of
squaws
and
children
approaching
over
the
prairie
and
presently
descried
the
bark

of
an

to
which
were

bundles

his

hair
and
face
had
been
painted
with

was
decorated
with

in

guise
he
was
entering
the
village
followed
by
a
crowd
of

who
compelled
him
to
sing
and
keep
time
to
his
own
music
by
rattling
a
dried
gourd
containing
a
number
of
pebbles
the
omens
indeed
were
exceedingly
threatening
for
treatment
like
this
was
usually
followed
by
the
speedy
immolation
of
the
captive
hennepin
ascribes
it
to
the
effect
of
his
invocations
that
being
led
into
one
of
the
lodges
among
a
throng
of
staring
squaws
and
children
he
and
his
companions
were
seated
on
the
ground
and
presented
with
large
dishes
of
birch
bark
containing
a
mess
of
wild
rice
boiled
with
dried
whortleberries

repast
which

declares
to

been

had
fallen

his
lot

of
his
captivity
footnote
the
sioux
or
dacotah
as
they
call
themselves
were
a
numerous
people
separated
into
three
great
divisions
which
were
again
subdivided
into
bands
those
among
whom
hennepin
was
a
prisoner
belonged
to
the
division
known
as
the
issanti
issanyati
or
as
he
writes
it
issati
of
which
the
principal
band
was
the
meddewakantonwan
the
other
great
divisions
the
yanktons
and
the
tintonwans
or
tetons
lived
west
of
the
mississippi
extending
beyond
the
missouri
and
ranging
as
far
as
the
rocky
mountains
the
issanti
cultivated
the
soil
but
the
extreme
western
bands
subsisted
on
the
buffalo
alone
the
former
had
two
kinds
of
dwelling
the
or
skin
lodge
and
the
bark
lodge
the
teepee
which
was
used
by
all
the
sioux
consists
of
a
covering
of
dressed
buffalo
hide
stretched
on
a
conical
stack
of
poles
the
bark
lodge
was
peculiar
to
the
eastern
sioux
and
examples
of
it
might
be
seen
until
within
a
few
years
among
the
bands
on
the
peter
in
its
general
character
it
was
like
the
huron
and
iroquois
houses
but
was
inferior
in
construction
it
had
a
ridge
roof
framed
of
poles
extending
from
the
posts
which
formed
the
sides
and
the
whole
was
covered
with
the
lodges
in
the
villages
to
which
hennepin
was
conducted
were
probably
of
this
kind
the
name
sioux
is
an
abbreviation
of
an
ojibwa
word

the
ojibwas

it
to
designate
this

occasionally
also

years
a
missionary
among
the
issanti
sioux
says
that
this
division
consists
of
four
distinct
bands
they
ceded
all
their
lands
east
of
the
mississippi
to
the
united
states

lived
on

driven
thence

of
two
bands
which
are
again
subdivided
the
assiniboins
or
hohays
are
an
offshoot
from
the
yanktons
with
whom
they
are
now
at
war
the
titonwan
or
teton
sioux
forming
the
most
western
division
and
the
largest
comprise
seven
bands
and
are
among
the
bravest
and
fiercest
tenants
of
the
prairie
the
earliest
french
writers
estimate
the
total
number
of
the
sioux
at
forty
thousand
riggs
in
placed
it
at
about
thousand
lake
many
other
indian
tribes
they
seem
practically
incapable
of
civilization
this
soothed
his
fears
but
as
he
allayed
his
famished
appetite
he
listened
with
anxious
interest
to
the
vehement
jargon
of
the
chiefs
and
warriors
who
were
disputing
among
themselves
to
whom
the
three
captives
should
respectively
belong
for
it
seems
that
as
far
as
related
to
them
the
question
of
distribution
had
not
yet
been
definitely
settled
the
debate
ended
in
the
assigning
of
hennepin
to
his
old
enemy
aquipaguetin
who
however
far
from
persisting
in
his
evil
designs
adopted
him
on
the
spot
as
his
son
the
three
companions
must
now
part
company
du
gay
not
yet
quite
reassured
of
his
safety
hastened
to
confess
himself
to
hennepin
but
accau
proved
refractory
and
refused
the
offices
of
religion
which
did
not
prevent
the
friar
from
embracing
them
both
as
he
says
with
an
extreme
tenderness
tired
as
he
was
he
was
forced
to
set
out
with
his
father
to
his
village
which
was
fortunately
not
far
off
an
unpleasant
walk
of
a
few
miles
through
woods
and
marshes
brought
them
to
the
borders
of
a
sheet
of
water
apparently
lake
buade
where
five
of
aquipaguetin
wives
received
the
party
in
three
canoes
and
ferried
them
to
an
island
on
which
the
village
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
chief
lodge
hennepin
was
met
by
a
decrepit
old
indian
withered
with
age
who
offered
him
the
and
placed
him
on
a
which
was
spread
by
the
fire
here
to
relieve
his
fatigue
for
he
was
spent
a
small
boy
anointed
his
limbs
with
the
fat
of
a
wild
cat
supposed
to
be
sovereign
in
these
cases
by
reason
of
the
great
agility
of
that
animal
his
new
father
gave
him
a
bark
platter
of
fish
covered
him
with
a
buffalo
robe
and
showed
him
six
or
seven
of
his
wives
who
were
thenceforth
he
was
told
to
regard
him
as
a
son
the
household
was
numerous
and
his
allies
and
relations
formed
a
considerable
clan
of
which
the
missionary
found
himself
an
involuntary
member
he
was
scandalized
when
he
saw
one
of
his
adopted
brothers
carrying
on
his
back
the
bones
of
a
deceased
friend
wrapped
in
the
chasuble
of
brocade
which
they
had
taken
with
other
vestments
from
his
box
seeing
their
new
relative
so
enfeebled
that
he
could
scarcely
stand
the
indians
made
for
him
one
of
their
sweating
baths
footnote
these
baths
consist
of
a
small
hut
covered
closely
with
into
which
the
patient
and
his
friends
enter
carefully
closing
every
aperture
a
pile
of
heated
stones
is
placed
in
the
middle
and
water
is
poured
upon
them
raising
a
dense
vapor
they
are
still
in
use
among
the
sioux
and
some
other
tribes
where
they
immersed
him
in
steam
three
times
a
week
a
process
from
which
he
thinks
he
derived
great
benefit
his
strength
gradually
returned
in
spite
of
his
meagre
fare
for
there
was
a
dearth
of
food
and
the
squaws
were
less
attentive
to
his
wants
than
to
those
of
their
children
they
respected
him
however
as
a
person
endowed
with
occult
powers
and
stood
in
no
little
awe
of
a
pocket
compass
which
he
had
with
him
as
well
as
of
a
small
metal
pot
with
feet
moulded
after
the
face
of
a
lion
this
last
seemed
in
their
eyes
a
medicine
of
the
most
formidable
nature
and
they
would
not
touch
it
without
first
wrapping
it
in
a
for
the
rest
hennepin
made
himself
useful
in
various
ways
he
shaved
the
heads
of
the
children
as
was
the
custom
of
the
tribe
bled
certain
asthmatic
persons
and
dosed
others
with
orvietan
the
famous
panacea
of
his
time
of
which
he
had
brought
with
him
a
good
supply
with
respect
to
his
missionary
functions
he
seems
to
have
given
himself
little
trouble
unless
his
attempt
to
make
a
sioux
vocabulary
is
to
be
regarded
as
preparatory
to
a
future
apostleship
i
could
gain
nothing
over
them
he
says
in
the
way
of
their
salvation
by
reason
of
their
natural
stupidity
nevertheless
on
one
occasion
he
baptized
a
sick
child
naming
it
antoinette
in
honor
of
anthony
of
padua
it
seemed
to
revive
after
the
rite
but
soon
relapsed
and
presently
died
which
he
writes
gave
me
great
joy
and
satisfaction
in
this
he
was
like
the
jesuits
who
could
find
nothing
but
consolation
in
the
death
of
a
newly
baptized
infant
since
it
was
thus
assured
of
a
paradise
which
had
it
lived
it
would
probably
have
forfeited
by
sharing
in
the
superstitions
of
its
parents
with
respect
to
hennepin
and
his
indian
father
there
seems
to
have
been
little
love
on
either
side
but
ouasicoude
the
principal
chief
of
the
sioux
of
this
region
was
the
fast
friend
of
the
three
white
men
he
was
angry
that
they
had
been
robbed
which
he
had
been
unable
to
prevent
as
the
sioux
had
no
laws
and
their
chiefs
little
power
but
he
spoke
his
mind
freely
and
told
aquipaguetin
and
the
rest
in
full
council
that
they
were
like
a
dog
who
steals
a
piece
of
meat
from
a
dish
and
runs
away
with
it
when
hennepin
complained
of
hunger
the
indians
had
always
promised
him
that
early
in
the
summer
he
should
go
with
them
on
a
buffalo
hunt
and
have
food
in
abundance
the
time
at
length
came
and
the
inhabitants
of
all
the
neighboring
villages
prepared
for
departure
to
each
several
band
was
assigned
its
special
and
he
was
expected
to
accompany
his
indian
father
to
this
he
demurred
for
he
feared
lest
aquipaguetin
angry
at
the
words
of
the
great
chief
might
take
this
opportunity
to
revenge
the
insult
put
upon
him
he
therefore
gave
out
that
he
expected
a
party
of
spirits
that
is
to
say
frenchmen
to
meet
him
at
the
mouth
of
the
wisconsin
bringing
a
supply
of
goods
for
the
indians
and
he
declares
that
la
salle
had
in
fact
promised
to
send
traders
to
that
place
be
this
as
it
may
the
indians
believed
him
and
true
or
false
the
assertion
as
will
be
seen
answered
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
made
the
indians
set
out
in
a
body
to
the
number
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
warriors
with
their
women
and
children
the
three
frenchmen
who
though
in
different
villages
had
occasionally
met
during
the
two
months
of
their
captivity
were
all
of
the
party
they
descended
rum
river
which
forms
the
outlet
of
mille
lac
and
which
is
called
the
francis
by
hennepin
none
of
the
indians
had
offered
to
give
him
passage
and
fearing
lest
he
should
be
abandoned
he
stood
on
the
bank
hailing
the
passing
canoes
and
begging
to
be
taken
in
accau
and
du
gay
presently
appeared
paddling
a
small
canoe
which
the
indians
had
given
them
but
they
would
not
listen
to
the
missionary
call
and
accau
who
had
no
love
for
him
cried
out
that
he
had
paddled
him
long
enough
already
two
indians
however
took
pity
on
him
and
brought
him
to
the
place
of
encampment
where
du
gay
tried
to
excuse
himself
for
his
conduct
but
accau
was
sullen
and
kept
aloof
after
reaching
the
mississippi
the
whole
party
encamped
together
opposite
to
the
mouth
of
rum
river
pitching
their
tents
of
skin
or
building
their
bark
huts
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
by
the
side
of
the
water
it
was
a
wild
scene
this
camp
of
savages
among
whom
as
yet
no
traders
had
come
and
no
handiwork
of
civilization
had
found
its
way
the
tall
warriors
some
nearly
naked
some
wrapped
in
buffalo
robes
and
some
in
shirts
of
dressed
deerskin
fringed
with
hair
and
embroidered
with
dyed
porcupine
quills
of
stone
in
their
hands
and
quivers
at
their
backs
filled
with
arrows
the
squaws
cutting
meat
with
knives
of
flint
and
boiling
it
in
rude
earthen
pots
of
their
own
making
driving
away
meanwhile
with
shrill
cries
the
troops
of
lean
dogs
who
disputed
the
meal
with
a
crew
of
hungry
children
the
whole
camp
indeed
was
threatened
with
starvation
the
three
white
men
could
get
no
food
but
unripe
berries
from
the
effects
of
which
hennepin
thinks
they
might
all
have
died
but
for
timely
doses
of
his
orvietan
being
tired
of
the
indians
he
became
anxious
to
set
out
for
the
wisconsin
to
find
the
party
of
frenchmen
real
or
imaginary
who
were
to
meet
him
at
that
place
that
he
was
permitted
to
do
so
was
due
to
the
influence
of
the
great
chief
ouasicoudé
who
always
befriended
him
and
who
had
soundly
berated
his
two
companions
for
refusing
him
a
seat
in
their
canoe
du
gay
wished
to
go
with
him
but
accau
who
liked
the
indian
life
as
much
as
he
disliked
hennepin
preferred
to
remain
with
the
hunters
a
small
birch
canoe
was
given
to
the
two
adventurers
together
with
an
earthen
pot
and
they
had
also
between
them
a
gun
a
knife
and
a
robe
of
thus
equipped
they

notice
of
the
falls
of
anthony
though
brief
is
sufficiently
accurate

says
in

edition
that
they
are
forty

fifty
feet
high

ten
feet

changes
however
have
taken
place
here
and
are
still
in
progress
the
rock
is
a
very
soft
friable
sandstone
overlaid
by
a
stratum
of
limestone
and
it
is
crumbling
with
such
rapidity
under
the
action
of
the
water
that
the
cataract
will
soon
be
little
more
than
a
rapid
other
changes
equally
disastrous
in
an
artistic
point
of
view
are
going
on
even
more
quickly
beside
the
falls
stands
a
city
which
by
an
ingenious
combination
of
the
greek
and
sioux
languages
has
received
the
name
of
minneapolis
or
city
of

waters
and
which
in
contained
ten
thousand
inhabitants
two
national
banks
and
an
while
its
rival
city
of
anthony
immediately
opposite
boasted
a
gigantic
and
a
state
university
in
short
the
great
natural
beauty
of
the
place
is
utterly
spoiled
as
they
were
carrying
their
canoe
by
the
cataract
they
saw
five
or
six
indians
who
had
gone
before
one
of
whom
had
climbed
into
an
beside
the
principal
fall
whence
in
a
loud
and
lamentable
voice
he
was
haranguing
the
spirit
of
the
waters
as
a
sacrifice
to
whom
he
had
just
hung
a
robe
of
among
the
branches
footnote
oanktayhee
the
principal
deity
of
the
sioux
was
supposed
to
live
under
these
falls
though
he
manifested
himself
in
the
form
of
a
buffalo
it
was
he
who
created
the
earth

every

he
had
about
him
into

offering
to

deity
their
attention
was
soon
engrossed
by
another
object
looking
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
which
overhung
the
river
below
the
falls
hennepin
saw
a
snake
which
as
he
avers
was

writhing
upward
towards
the
holes
of
the
swallows
in
the
face
of
the
precipice
in
order
to
devour
their
young
he
pointed
him
out
to
du
gay
and
they
pelted
him
with
stones
till
he
fell
into
the
river
but
not
before
his
contortions
and
the
darting
of
his
forked
tongue
had
so
affected
the
imagination
that
he
was
haunted
that
night
with
a
terrific
incubus
they
paddled
sixty
leagues
down
the
river
in
the
heats
of
july
and
killed
no
large
game
but
a
single
deer
the
meat
of
which
soon
spoiled
their
main
resource
was
the
turtles
whose
shyness
and
watchfulness
caused
them
frequent
disappointments
and
many
involuntary
fasts
they
once
captured
one
of
more
than
common
size
and
as
they
were
endeavoring
to
cut
off
his
head
he
was
near
avenging
himself
by
snapping
off
hennepin
finger
there
was
a
herd
of
buffalo
in
sight
on
the
neighboring
prairie
and
du
gay
went
with
his
gun
in
pursuit
of
them
leaving
the
turtle
in
custody
scarcely
was
he
gone
when
the
friar
raising
his
eyes
saw
that
their
canoe
which
they
had
left
at
the
edge
of
the
water
had
floated
out
into
the
current
hastily
turning
the
turtle
on
his
back
he
covered
him
with
his
habit
of
francis
on
which
for
greater
security
he
laid
a
number
of
stones
and
then
being
a
good
swimmer
struck
out
in
pursuit
of
the
canoe
which
he
at
length
overtook
finding
that
it
would
overset
if
he
tried
to
climb
into
it
he
pushed
it
before
him
to
the
shore
and
then
paddled
towards
the
place
at
some
distance
above
where
he
had
left
the
turtle
he
had
no
sooner
reached
it
than
he
heard
a
strange
sound
and
beheld
a
long
file
of
buffalo
bulls
cows
and
calves
entering
the
water
not
far
off
to
cross
to
the
western
bank
having
no
gun
as
became
his
apostolic
vocation
he
shouted
to
du
gay
who
presently
appeared
running
in
all
haste
and
they
both
paddled
in
pursuit
of
the
game
du
gay
aimed
at
a
young
cow
and
shot
her
in
the
head
she
fell
in
shallow
water
near
an
island
where
some
of
the
herd
had
landed
and
being
unable
to
drag
her
out
they
waded
into
the
water
and
butchered
her
where
she
lay
it
was
hours
since
they
had
tasted
food
hennepin
made
a
fire
while
du
gay
cut
up
the
meat
they
feasted
so
bountifully
that
they
both
fell
ill
and
were
forced
to
remain
two
days
on
the
island
taking
doses
of
orvietan
before
they
were
able
to
resume
their
journey
apparently
they
were
not
sufficiently
versed
in
woodcraft
to
smoke
the
meat
of
the
cow
and
the
hot
sun
soon
robbed
them
of
it
they
had
a
few
but
were
not
always
successful
in
the
use
of
them
on
one
occasion
being
nearly
famished
they
set
their
line
and
lay
watching
it
uttering
prayers
in
turn
suddenly
there
was
a
great
turmoil
in
the
water
du
gay
ran
to
the
line
and
with
the
help
of
hennepin
drew
in
two

of

astonishment

hundred
and
fifty
pounds

eagles
or
now
and
then
dropped
a
newly
caught
fish
of
which
they
gladly
took
possession
and
once
they
found
a
purveyor
in
an
otter
which
they
saw
by
the
bank
devouring
some
object
of
an
appearance
so
wonderful
that
du
gay
cried
out
that
he
had
a
devil

his
paws

scared
him
from

prey

veiled

and
the
quavering
scream
of

owls
other
thoughts
than
the
study
of
the
picturesque
occupied
the
mind
of
hennepin
when
one
day
he
saw
his
indian
father
aquipaguetin
whom
he
had
supposed
five
hundred
miles
distant
descending
the
river
with
ten
warriors
in
canoes
he
was
eager
to
be
the
first
to
meet
the
traders
who
as
hennepin
had
given
out
were
to
come
with
their
goods
to
the
mouth
of
the
wisconsin
the
two
travellers
trembled
for
the
consequences
of
this
encounter
but
the
chief
after
a
short
colloquy
passed
on
his
way
in
three
days
he
returned
in
having
found
no
traders
at
the
appointed
spot
the
picard
was
absent
at
the
time
looking
for
game
and
hennepin
was
sitting
under
the
shade
of
his
blanket
which
he
had
stretched
on
forked
sticks
to
protect
him
from
the
sun
when
he
saw
his
adopted
father
approaching
with
a
threatening
look
and
a
in
his
hand
he
attempted
no
violence
however
but
suffered
his
wrath
to
exhale
in
a
severe
scolding
after
which
he
resumed
his
course
up
the
river
with
his
warriors
if
hennepin
as
he
avers
really
expected
a
party
of
traders
at
the
wisconsin
the
course
he
now
took
is
sufficiently
explicable
if
he
did
not
expect
them
his
obvious
course
was
to
rejoin
tonty
on
the
illinois
for
which
he
seems
to
have
had
no
inclination
or
to
return
to
canada
by
way
of
the
wisconsin
an
attempt
which
involved
the
risk
of
starvation
as
the
two
travellers
had
but
ten
charges
of
powder
left
assuming
then
his
hope
of
the
traders
to
have
been
real
he
and
du
gay
resolved
in
the
mean
time
to
join
a
large
body
of
sioux
hunters
who
as
aquipaguetin
had
told
them
were
on
a
stream
which
he
calls
bull
river
now
the
chippeway
entering
the
mississippi
near
lake
pepin
by
so
doing
they
would
gain
a
supply
of
food
and
save
themselves
from
the
danger
of
encountering
parties
of
roving
warriors
they
found
this
band
among
whom
was
their
companion
accau
and
followed
them
on
a
grand
hunt
along
the
borders
of
the
mississippi
du
gay
was
separated
for
a
time
from
hennepin
who
was
placed
in
a
canoe
with
a
withered
squaw
more
than
eighty
years
old
in
spite
of
her
age
she
handled
her
paddle
with
admirable
address
and
used
it
vigorously
as
occasion
required
to
repress
the
gambols
of
three
children
who
to
hennepin
great
annoyance
occupied
the
middle
of
the
canoe
the
hunt
was
successful
the
sioux
warriors
active
as
deer
chased
the
buffalo
on
foot
with
their
arrows
on
the
plains
behind
the
heights
that
bordered
the
river
while
the
old
men
stood
sentinels
at
the
top
watching
for
the
approach
of
enemies
one
day
an
alarm
was
given
the
warriors
rushed
towards
the
supposed
point
of
danger
but
found
nothing
more
formidable
than
two
squaws
of
their
own
nation
who
brought
strange
news
a
of
sioux
they
said
had
gone
towards
lake
superior
and
met
by
the
way
five
spirits
that
is
to
say
five
europeans
hennepin
was
full
of
curiosity
to
learn
who
the
strangers
might
be
and
they
on
their
part
were
said
to
have
shown
great
anxiety
to
know
the
nationality
of
the
three
white
men
who
as
they
were
told
were
on
the
river
the
hunt
was
over
and
the
hunters
with
hennepin
and
his
companion
were
on
their
way
northward
to
their

they
met
the
five
spirits

whose
admirable
military

shone
forth
so

to
gain

with
the
colonial
minister
seignelay
amid
the
splendid
vanities
of

strange
to
say
this
man
of
hardy
enterprise
was
a
martyr
to
the
gout
which
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
grievously
tormented
him
though
for
a
time
he
thought
himself
cured
by
the
intercession
of
the
iroquois
saint
catharine
tegahkouita
to
whom
he
had
made
a
vow
to
that
end
he
was
without
doubt
an
habitual
breaker
of
the
royal
ordinances
regulating
the
yet
his
services
were
great
to
the
colony
and
to
the
crown

his
name
deserves
a
place
of
honor
among
the
pioneers
of

civilization

the
facts

the
letters

puts
him
in

worst
light

the

reached
from
thence
a
branch
of

to
have
been

it
was
now
that
to
his
surprise
he
learned
that
there
were
three

on

fearing

they

met
with

they
followed

hennepin
had
now
no

the

consoled
by
their
promises
to
return
with
goods
for
trade
did
not
oppose
their
departure

they
set
out

eight
white
men

passed

two
of

stole
two

which
were
hung
on

to

when
du

heard
of
it
he
was
very
angry
telling
the
men
that
they
had
endangered
the
lives
of
the
whole
party
hennepin
admitted
that
in
the
view
of
human
prudence
he
was
right
but
urged
that
the
act
was
good
and
praiseworthy
inasmuch
as
the
offerings
were
made
to
a
false
god
while
the
men
on
their
part
proved
mutinous
declaring
that
they
wanted
the
robes
and
meant
to
keep
them
the
travellers
continued
their
journey
in
great
ill
humor
but
were
presently
soothed
by
the
excellent
hunting
which
they
found
on
the
way
as
they
approached
the
wisconsin
they
stopped
to
dry
the
meat
of
the
buffalo
they
had
killed
when
to
their
amazement
they
saw
a
of
sioux
approaching
in
a
fleet
of
canoes
hennepin
represents
himself
as
showing
on
this
occasion
an
extraordinary
courage
going
to
meet
the
indians
with
a
and

du
lhut
who
knew
more
of
these
matters
than
he
how
it
behooved
him
to
conduct
himself
the
sioux
proved
not
unfriendly
and
said
nothing
of
the
theft
of
the
buffalo
robes
they
soon
went
on
their
way
to
attack
the
illinois
and
missouris
leaving
the
frenchmen
to
ascend
the
wisconsin
unmolested
after
various
adventures
they
reached
the
station
of
the
jesuits
at
green
bay
but
its
existence
is
wholly
ignored
by
hennepin
whose
zeal
for
his
own
order
will
not
permit
him
to
allude
to
this
establishment
of
the
rival
missionaries
footnote
on
the
other
hand
he
sets
down
on
his
map
of
a
mission
of
the
récollets
at
a
point
north
of
the
farthest
sources
of
the
mississippi
to
which
no
white
man
had
ever
penetrated
he
is
equally
reticent
with
regard
to
the
jesuit
mission
at
michillimackinac
where
the
party
soon
after
arrived
and
where
they
spent
the
winter
the
only
intimation
which
he
gives
of
its
existence
consists
in
the
mention
of
the
jesuit
pierson
who
was
a
fleming
like
himself
and
who
often
skated
with
him
on
the
frozen
lake
or
kept
him
company
in
fishing
through
a
hole
in
the
ice
footnote
he
says
that
pierson
had
come
among
the
indians
to
learn
their
language
that
he
retained
the
frankness
and
rectitude
of
our
country
and
a
disposition
always
on
the
side
of
candor
and
sincerity
in
a
word

seemed
to
me
to
lie
all
that
a
christian
ought
to
be

the
spring
opened
hennepin
descended
lake
huron
followed
the
detroit
to

proceeded
thence
to
niagara
here
he
spent
some
time
in
making
a
fresh
examination
of
the
cataract
and
then
resumed
his
voyage
on
lake
ontario
he
stopped
however
at
the
great
town
of
the
senecas
near
the
genessee
where
with
his
usual
spirit
of
meddling
he
took
upon
him
the
functions
of
the
civil
and
military
authorities
convoked
the
chiefs
to
a
council
and
urged
them
to
set
at
liberty
certain
ottawa
prisoners
whom
they
had
captured
in
violation
of
treaties
having
settled
this
affair
to
his
satisfaction
he
went
to
fort
frontenac
where
his
brother
missionary
buisset
received
him
with
a
welcome
rendered
the
warmer
by
a
story
which
had
reached
him
that
the
indians
had
hanged
hennepin
with
his
own
cord

looking
from
the
window
of
a

near

saw
approaching

a

father
whose
appearance
indicated
the
extremity
of
hard
service

his
face
was
worn
and
sunburnt

his
tattered
habit
of
francis
was
abundantly
patched
with
scraps
of

at

he
recognized
the

received
him
as
the
father

with
all
the
tenderness
which
a
missionary
could
expect
from
a
person
of
his
rank
and
quality
footnote
he
kept
him
for
twelve
days
in
his

listened
with
interest

sight
of
la
salle
the
pivot
of
the
enterprise
returning
from
the
desolation
and
horror
in
the
valley
of
the
illinois
he
had
spent
the
winter
at
fort
miami
on
the
joseph
by
the
borders
of
lake
michigan
here
he
might
have
brooded
on
the
redoubled
ruin
that
had
befallen
him
the
desponding
friends
the
exulting
foes
the
wasted
energies
the
crushing
load
of
debt
the
stormy
past
the
black
and
lowering
future
but
his
mind
was
of
a
different
temper
he
had
no
thought
but
to
grapple
with
adversity
and
out
of
the
fragments
of
his
ruin
to
rear
the
fabric
of
a
triumphant
success
he
would
not
recoil
but
he
modified
his
plans
to
meet
the
new
contingency
his
white
enemies
had
found
or
rather
perhaps
had
made
a
savage
ally
in
the
iroquois
their
incursions
must
be
stopped
or
his
enterprise
would
come
to
nought
and
he
thought
he
saw
the
means
by
which
this
new
danger
could
be
converted
into
a
source
of
strength
the
tribes
of
the
west
threatened
by
the
common
enemy
might
be
taught
to
forget
their
mutual
animosities
and
join
in
a
defensive
league
with
la
salle
at
its
head
they
might
be
colonized
around
his
fort
in
the
valley
of
the
illinois
where
in
the
shadow
of
the
french
flag
and
with
the
aid
of
french
allies
they
could
hold
the
iroquois
in
check
and
acquire
in
some
measure
the
arts
of
a
settled
life
the
franciscan
friars
could
teach
them
the
faith
and
la
salle
and
his
associates
could
supply
them
with
goods
in
exchange
for
the
vast
harvest
of
furs
which
their
hunters
could
gather
in
these
boundless
wilds
meanwhile
he
would
seek
out
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
and
the
furs
gathered
at
his
colony
in
the
illinois
would
then
find
a
ready
passage
to
the
markets
of
the
world
thus
might
this
ancient
of
warring
savages
be
redeemed
to
civilization
and
christianity
and
a
stable
settlement
grow
up
in
the
heart
of
the
western
wilderness
the
scheme
was
but
a
new
feature
the
result
of
new
circumstances
added
to
the
original
plan
of
his
great
enterprise
and
he
addressed
himself
to
its
execution
with
his
usual
vigor
and
with
an
address
which
never
failed
him
in
his
dealings
with
indians
there
were

close
at

near
fort

were
the
huts
of
five
or
thirty
savages

several
of
the

from

to

had
of
late
years
been
harassed
by
indian
wars
and
the
puritans
of

above
all
had
been
scourged
by
the
deadly
outbreak
of
king
philip
war
those
engaged
in
it
had
paid
a
bitter
price
for
their
brief
triumphs
a
band
of
refugees
chiefly
abenakis
and
mohegans
driven
from
their
native
seats
had
roamed
into
these
distant
wilds
and
were
wintering
in
the
friendly
neighborhood
of
the
french
la
salle
soon
won
them
over
to
his
interests
one
of
their
number
was
the
mohegan
hunter
who
for
two
years
had
faithfully
followed
his
fortunes
and
who
had
been
for
four
years
in
the
west
he
is
described
as
a
prudent
and
discreet
young
man
in
whom
la
salle
had
great
confidence
and
who
could
make
himself
understood
in
several
western
languages
belonging
like
his
own
to
the
great
algonquin
tongue
this
devoted
henchman
proved
an
efficient
mediator
with
his
countrymen
the
indians
with
one
voice
promised
to
follow
la
salle
asking
no
recompense
but
to
call
him
their
chief
and
yield
to
him
the
love
and
admiration
which
he
rarely
failed
to
command
from
this
race

soon
appeared
a
shawanoe
chief
from
the

whose
following
embraced
a
hundred
and
fifty
warriors
came
to
ask
the
protection
of
the

are
too
distant
was
la

reply
but
let
them
come
to
me

and
they
shall

the
chief
promised
to
join
him
in
the
autumn
at
fort
miami
with
all
his
band
but
more
important
than
all
the
consent
and
of
the
illinois
must
be
gained
and
the
miamis
their
neighbors
and
of
late
their
enemies
must
be
taught
the
folly
of
their
league
with
the
iroquois
and
the
necessity
of
joining
in
the
new
confederation
of
late
they
had
been
made
to
see
the
perfidy
of
their
dangerous
allies
a
band
of
the
iroquois
returning
from
the
slaughter
of
the
tamaroa
illinois
had
met
and
murdered
a
band
of
miamis
on
the
ohio
and
had
not
only
refused
satisfaction
but
entrenched
themselves
in
three
rude
forts
of
trees
and
brushwood
in
the
heart
of
the
miami
country
the
moment
was
favorable

also
it

set
out
on
the
first

with
his
lieutenant

nineteen
men
the

dazzling

the

pursued

soon

the
village
of
the
miami
indians
on
the
portage
at
the
head
of
the
kankakee
here
he
found
unwelcome
guests
these
were
a
band
of
iroquois
warriors
who
had
been
for
some
time
in
the
place
and
who
as
he
was
told
had
demeaned
themselves
with
the
insolence
of
conquerors
and
spoken
of
the
french
with
the
utmost
contempt
he
hastened
to
confront
them
rebuked
and
menaced
them
and
told
them
that
now
when
he
was
present
they
dared
not
repeat
the
calumnies
which
they
had
uttered
in
his
absence
they
stood
abashed
and
confounded
and
during
the
following
night
secretly
left
the
town
and
fled
the
effect
was
prodigious
on
the
minds
of
the
miamis
when
they
saw
that
la

backed
by
ten
frenchmen
could
command
from
their
arrogant
visitors
a
respect
which
they
with
their
hundreds
of
warriors
had
wholly
failed
to
inspire
here
at
the
outset
was
an
augury
full
of
promise
for
the
approaching
negotiations
there
were
other
strangers
in
the
town
a
band
of
eastern
indians
more
numerous
than
those
who
had
wintered
at
the
fort
the
greater
number
were
from
rhode
island

probably
some
of
king
philip
warriors
others
were
from

and
others
again
from

a

an

make
peace
between
the
miamis
and

and
he
would
insure
for
them
a
future
of
prosperity
and
safety
they
listened
with
open
ears
and
promised
their
aid
in
the
work
of
peace
on
the
next
morning
the
miamis
were
called
to
a
grand
council
it
was
held
in

confirm
his
words
his
attendants
placed
before

a
huge
pile
of
coats

exploded
in

came
the
climax

harangue
introduced
by

he
who

is
a

chief
feared
by
the
whole

but
he
loves
peace
and
the
words
of
his
lips
are
for
good
alone
he
is
called
the
king
of
france
and
he
is
the
mightiest
among
the
chiefs
beyond
the
great
water
his
goodness
reaches
even
to
your
dead
and
his
subjects
come
among
you
to
raise
them
up
to
life
but
it
is
his
will
to
preserve
the
life
he
has
given
it
is
his
will
that
you
should
obey
his
laws
and
make
no
war
without
the
leave
of
onontio
who
commands
in
his
name
at
quebec
and
who
loves
all
the
nations
alike
because
such
is
the
will
of
the
great
king
you
ought
then
to
live
at
peace
with
your
neighbors
and
above
all
with
the
illinois
you
have
had
causes
of
quarrel
with
them
but
their
defeat
has
avenged
you
though
they
are
still
strong
they
wish
to
make
peace
with
you
be
content
with
the
glory
of
having
obliged
them
to
ask
for
it
you
have
an

in
preserving
them
since
if
the

destroy
them
they
will
next
destroy
you
let

his
thanks
were
due

to

not
a

disperse
it

it
were
twofold
first
he
must
give
efficient
aid
to
his
savage
colonists
against
the
iroquois
secondly
he
must
supply
them
with
french
goods
in
exchange
for
their
furs
the
men
arms
and
ammunition
for
their
defence
and
the
goods
for
trading
with
them
must
be
brought
from

until
a
better
and
surer
avenue
of
supply
could
be
provided

the

again
invading

the

were
so
alarmed
by
them
that
they
abandoned
their
town
and
fled
but
at
my
return
they
came
back
and
have
been
induced
to
settle
with
the

at

the
iroquois
have
lately
murdered
some
families
of
their
nation

they
are
all
in
terror
again

afraid
they
will
take

so
prevent

of

tell

i

here
for

i
pray
that
you
will
let

hear
from
you
that
i
may
give
these
people
some
assurances

protection
before
they
are

do
not
suffer
my

who
have
come
down
to
the

to
be

prevented
from
returning
there
is
great
need
here
of
reinforcements
the
iroquois
as
i
have
said
have
lately
entered
the
country
and
a
great
terror
prevails
i
have
postponed
going
to
michillimackinac
because
if
the
iroquois
strike
any
blow
in
my
absence
the
miamis
will
think
that
i
am
in
league
with
them
whereas
if
i
and
the
french
stay
among
them
they
will
regard
us
as
protectors
but
monsieur
it
is
in
vain
that
we
risk
our
lives
here
and
that
i
exhaust
my
means
in
order
to
fulfil
the
intentions
of
his
majesty
if
all
my
measures
are
crossed
in
the

below

if
those
who
go
down
to
bring
munitions
without
which
we
can
not
defend
ourselves
are
detained
under
pretexts
trumped
up
for
the
occasion

i
am
prevented
from
bringing
up
men

as
i
am
allowed
to
do
by
the
permit
of

then
my

is
useless
it
would
be
very
hard
for
us
after
having
done
what
was
required
even
before
the
time
prescribed
and
after
suffering
severe
losses
to
have
our
efforts
frustrated
by

got
up

that
as
it
lies
with
you
alone

prevent

permit
the

belong
not

to
the

a

others

indispensable

do
not

them
it

for
their
advantage
that
my

should
be
held
against
the

i
have
only
twenty
men
with
scarcely
a
hundred
pounds
of

and
i
can
not
long
hold
the
country
without
more
the
illinois
are
very
capricious
and
uncertain
if
i
had
men
enough
to
send
out
to
reconnoitre
the

i
would
have
done
so
before

the

the

the

would
have
ruined

greatly
alarmed

its
complete
success
would
have
been
fatal

their
hopes

they
nevertheless
wished
it
such
a
measure
of
success
as
would
ruin
their
rival

no
little
satisfaction
mingled
with
their
anxiety

that
the

into

and
the
following

the
substance
of
them
the
preliminary
document
states
that
the
late
monseigneur
colbert
was
of
opinion
that
it
was
important
for
the
service
of
his
majesty
to
discover
a
port
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
that
to
this
end
the
memorialist
la
salle
made
five
journeys
of
upwards
of
five
thousand
leagues
in
great
part
on
foot
and
traversed
more
than
six
hundred
leagues
of
unknown
country
among
savages
and
cannibals
at
the
cost
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
crowns
he
now
proposes
to
return
by
way
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
to
the
countries
he
has
discovered
whence
great
benefits
may
be
expected
first
the
cause
of
god
may
be
advanced
by
the
preaching
of
the
gospel
to
many
indian
tribes
and
secondly
great
conquests
may
be
effected
for
the
glory
of
the
king
by
the
seizure
of
provinces
rich
in
silver
mines
and
defended
only
by
a
few
indolent
and
effeminate
spaniards
the
sieur

pursues
the
memorial
binds
himself
to
accomplish
this
enterprise
within
one
year
after
his
arrival
on

spot

he
asks
for
this
purpose
only
one
vessel
and
two
hundred
men
with
their
arms
munitions
pay
and
maintenance
when
monseigneur
shall
direct
him
he
will
give
the
details

what
he
proposes

memorial
then
describes
the
boundless
extent
the
fertility
and
resources
of
the
country
watered
by
the
river
colbert
or
mississippi
the
necessity
of
guarding
it
against
foreigners
who
will
be
eager
to
seize
it
now
that
la
discovery
has
made
it
known
and
the
ease
with
which
it
may
be
defended
by
one
or
two
forts
at
a
proper
distance
above
its
mouth
which
would
form
the
key
to
an
interior
region
eight
hundred

in
extent
should
foreigners
anticipate

was
the

it

to

that

believed
in

from

can
he
no
doubt
neither
can
it
reasonably
be
doubted
that
he
hoped
at
some
future
day
to
make
the
attempt
and
yet
it
is
incredible
that
he
proposed
his
plan
of
conquest
with
the
serious
intention
of
attempting
to
execute
it
at
the
time
and
in
the
manner
which
he
indicates
he
was
a
bold
schemer
but
neither
a
madman
nor
a
fool
the
project
as
set
forth
in
his
memorial
bears
all
the
indications
of
being
drawn
up
with
the
view
of
producing
a
certain
effect
on
the
minds
of
the
king
and
the
minister
ignorant
as
they
were
of
the
nature
of
the
country
and
the
character
of
its
inhabitants
they
could
see
nothing
impracticable
in
the
plan
of
mustering
and
keeping
together
an
army
of
fifteen
thousand
indians
footnote
while
the
plan
as
proposed
in
the
memorial
was
clearly
impracticable
the
subsequent
experience
of
the
french
in
texas
tended
to
prove
that
the
tribes
of
that
region
could
be
used
with
advantage
in
attacking
the
spaniards
of
mexico
and
that
an
inroad
on

comparatively
small
scale
might
have
been
successfully
made

their
help

ms
in
an
unpublished
memoir
of
the
year
the
seizure
of
the
mexican
mines
is
given
as
one
of
the
motives
of
the
colonization
of
louisiana
la
salle
immediate
necessity
was
to
obtain
from
the
court
the
means
for
establishing
a
fort
and
a
colony
within
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
this
was
essential
to
his
own
commercial
plans
nor
did
he
in
the
least
exaggerate
the
value
of
such
an
establishment
to
the
french
nation
and
the
importance
of
anticipating
other
powers
in
the
possession
of
it
but
he
needed
a
more
glittering
lure
to
attract
the
eyes
of
louis
and
seignelay
and
thus
it
would
appear
he
held
before
them
in
a
definite
and
tangible
form
the
project
of
spanish
conquest
which
had
haunted
his
imagination
from
youth
trusting
that
the
speedy
conclusion
of
peace
which
actually
took
place
would
absolve
him
from
the
immediate
execution
of
the
scheme
and
give
him
time
with
the
means
placed
at
his
disposal
to
mature
his
plans
and
prepare
for
eventual
action
such
a
procedure
may
be
charged
with
indirectness
but
it
was
in
accordance
with
the
wily
and
politic
element
from
which
the
iron
nature
of
la
salle
was
not
free
but
which
was
often
defeated
in
its
aims

other
elements

character

perfectly
sound

for

individual
above

and
crushed
with
debt
while
he
grasped

link
of
the
great
chain
another
no
less
essential
escaped
from
his
hand
while
he
built
up

was
reasonably

would

two

cavelier
came
to
ask
him
to
take
charge

that
he
did
not
wish
to
meddle
with
them
especially
as
nobody
knows
any
thing
about
them
and
as
la

has
sold
some
of
the
ammunition
and
provisions
that
cavelier
tells
him
that
he
thinks
his
brother
keeps
no
accounts
wishing
to
hide
his
affairs
from
everybody
that
he
learns
from
buccaneers
that
the
entrance
of
the
mississippi
is
very
shallow
and
difficult
and
that
this
is
the
worst
season
for
navigating
the
gulf
that
the
spaniards
have
in
these
seas
six
vessels
of
from
thirty
to
sixty
guns
each
besides
but
that
he
is
not
afraid
and
will
perish
or
bring
back
an
account
of
the
mississippi

he
adds
if

many

that
he
is
a

of
knowledge
that
he
has
reading

even
some

there
is
so
much
difference
between
theory
and
practice
that
a
man
who
has
only
the
former
will
always
be
at

there
is
also
a

difference

conducting

some
of

with

crying
out

set
upon
by

off

and
opened
a
parley
with

but
when
he
wished
to
reclaim
his
men
he
discovered
that
they
had
been
led
away
during

to
the

camp
a
league
and
a
half
distant
among

critical
but
the

must
be
recovered
and
he
led
his

in
haste
towards
the

yet
he
could
not
refrain
from
turning
a
moment
to
watch
the

as
she
neared
the
shoals
and
he
remarked
with
deep
anxiety
to
joutel
who
was
with
him
that
if
she
held
that
course
she
would
soon
be
aground
they
hurried
on
till
they
saw
the
indian
huts
about
fifty
of
them
shaped
and
covered
with
mats
and
hides
were
clustered
on
a
rising
ground
with
their

gathered
among

around
them
as
the
french
entered
the

there
was
the
report
of
a
cannon
from
the
seaward
the
startled
savages
dropped
flat
with
terror
a
different
fear
seized
la

for
he
knew
that
the
shot
was
a
signal
of
disaster
looking
back
he
saw
the

furling
her
sails
and
his
heart
sank
with
the
conviction
that
she
had
struck
upon
the
reef
smothering
his
distress
she
was
laden
with
all
the
stores
of
the
colony
he
pressed
forward
among
the
filthy
wigwams
whose
astonished
inmates
swarmed
about
the

between
curiosity
and
fear

racked

and
respect

a

the

to

the
significance
of

consists
in
two

thither
he

washed
up
in

which

had
twice
crossed

still
followed
his
fortunes
with
an
admiring
though
undemonstrative
fidelity

passed
the
prairie
and
neared
the
forest

they
saw
buffalo
and
the

approached
and
killed
several
of

first
is
by
far
the
best
that
of
cavelier
seems
the
work
of
a
man
of
confused
brain
and
indifferent
memory
some
of
his
statements
are
irreconcilable
with
those
of
joutel
and
douay
and
known
facts
of
his
history
justify
the
suspicion
of
a
wilful
inaccuracy
joutel
account
is
of
a
very
different
character
and
seems
to
be
the
work
of
an
honest
and
intelligent
man
douay
account
is
brief
but
it
agrees
with
that
of
joutel
in
most
essential
points
it
was
such
an
one
though
with
unwonted
hardships
as
is
familiar
to
the
memory
of
many
a
prairie
traveller
of
our
own
time
they
suffered
greatly
from
the
want
of
shoes
and
found
for
a
while
no
better
substitute
than
a
casing
of
raw
which
they
were
forced
to
keep
always
wet
as
when
dry
it
hardened
about
the
foot
like
iron
at
length
they
bought
dressed
skin
from
the
indians
of
which
they
made
tolerable
moccasons
the
rivers
streams
and
gulleys
filled
with
water
were
without
number
and
to
cross
them
they
made
a
boat
of
like
the
bull
boat
still
used
on
the
upper
missouri
this
did
good
service
as
with
the
help
of
their
horses
they
could
carry
it
with
them
two
or
three
men
could
cross
in
it
at
once
and
the
horses
swam
after
them
like
dogs
sometimes
they
traversed
the
sunny
prairie
sometimes
dived
into
the
dark
recesses
of
the
forest
where
the
buffalo
descending
daily
from
their
pastures
in
long
files
to
drink
at
the
river
often
made
a
broad
and
easy
path
for
the
travellers
when
foul
weather
arrested
them
they
built
huts
of
bark
and
long
and
safely
sheltered
lounged
away
the
day
while
their
horses
picketed
near
by
stood
steaming
in
the
rain
at
night
they
usually
set
a
rude
stockade
about
their
camp
and
here
by
the
grassy
border
of
a
brook
or
at
the
edge
of
a
grove
where
a
spring
bubbled
up
through
the
sands
they
lay
asleep
around
the
embers
of
their
fire
while
the
man
on
guard
listened
to
the
deep
breathing
of
the
slumbering
horses
and
the
howling
of
the
wolves
that
saluted
the
rising
moon
as
it
flooded
the
waste
of
prairie
with
pale
mystic
radiance
they
met
indians
almost
daily
sometimes
a
band
of
hunters
mounted
or
on
foot
chasing
buffalo
on
the
plains
sometimes
a
party
of
fishermen
sometimes
a
winter
camp
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
or
under
the
sheltering
border
of
a
forest
they
held
intercourse
with
them
in
the
distance
by
signs
often
they
disarmed
their
distrust
and
attracted
them
into
their
camp
and
often
they
visited
them
in
their
lodges
where
seated
on
they
smoked
with
their
entertainers
passing
the
pipe
from
hand
to
hand
after
the
custom
still
in
use
among
the
prairie
tribes
cavelier
says
that
they
once
saw
a
band
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
mounted
indians
attacking
a
herd
of
buffalo
with
lances
pointed
with
sharpened
bone
the
old
priest
was
delighted
with
the
sport
which
he
pronounces
the
most
diverting
thing
in
the
world
on
another
occasion
when
the
party
were
encamped
near
the
village
of
a
tribe
which
cavelier
calls
sassory
he
saw
them
catch
an
alligator
about
twelve
feet
long
which
they
proceeded
to
torture
as
if
he
were
a
human
enemy
first
putting
out
his
eyes
and
then
leading
him
to
the
neighboring
prairie
where
having
confined
him
by
a
number
of
stakes
they
spent
the
entire
day
in
tormenting
him

in

is
to

hidden
in
the

in

camp
about
six
miles
distant
it
is
easy
to
picture
with
sufficient
accuracy
the
features
of
the
scene
the
sheds
of
bark
and
branches
beneath

among
blankets
and
rude
harness
guns
and
pouches
the
men
lounged
away
the
hour
sleeping
or
smoking
or
talking
among
themselves
the
blackened
kettles
that
hung
from
tripods
of
poles
over
the
fires
the
indians
strolling
about
the
place
or
lying
like
dogs
in
the
sun
with
eyes
half
shut
yet
all
observant
and
in
the
neighboring

the
horses
grazing
under
the

of
a
watchman
it
was
the
nineteenth
of
march
and
moranget
had
been
two
days
absent
la

began
to
show
a
great
anxiety
some
bodings
of
the
truth
seem
to
have
visited
him
for
he
was
heard
to
ask
several
of
his
men
if
duhaut
liotot
and
hiens
had
not
of
late
shown
signs
of
discontent
unable
longer
to
endure
his
suspense
he
left
the
camp
in
charge
of
joutel
with
a
caution
to
stand
well
on
his
guard
and
set
out
in
search
of
his
nephew
with
the
friar
anastase
douay
and
two
indians
all
the
way
writes
the
friar
he
spoke
to
me
of
nothing
but
matters
of
piety
grace
and
predestination
enlarging
on
the
debt
he
owed
to
god
who
had
saved
him
from
so
many
perils
during
more
than
twenty
years
of
travel
in
america
suddenly
douay

i
saw
him
overwhelmed
with
a
profound
sadness
for
which
he
himself
could
not
account
he
was
so
much
moved
that
i
scarcely
knew
him
he
soon
recovered
his
usual
calmness
and
they
walked
on
till
they
approached
the
camp
of
duhaut
which
was
however
on
the
farther
side
of
a
small
river
looking
about
him
with
the
eye
of
a
woodsman
la
salle
saw
two
eagles
or
more
probably
circling
in
the
air
nearly
over
him
as
if
attracted
by
carcasses
of
beasts
or
men
he
fired
both
his
pistols
as
a
summons
to
any
of
his
followers
who
might
be
within
hearing
the
shots
reached
the
ears

the
conspirators
rightly
conjecturing
by
whom
they
were
fired
several
of
them
led
by
duhaut
crossed
the
river
at
a
little
distance
above
where
trees
or
other
intervening
objects
hid
them
from
sight
duhaut
and
the
surgeon
crouched
like
indians
in
the
long
dry
grass
of
the
last
summer
growth
while
stood
in

near
the
bank
la

continuing
to
advance
soon
saw
him
and
calling

him
demanded
where
was
moranget
the
man
without
lifting
his
hat
or
any
show
of
respect
replied
in
an
agitated
and
broken
voice
but
with
a
tone
of
studied
insolence
that
moranget
was
along
the
river
la

rebuked
and
menaced
him
he
rejoined
with
increased
insolence
drawing
back
as
he
spoke
towards
the
ambuscade
while
the
incensed
commander
advanced
to
chastise
him
at
that
moment
a
shot
was
fired
from
the
grass
instantly
followed
by
another
and
pierced
through
the
brain

dropped

the
friar
at
his
side
stood
in
an
ecstasy
of
fright
unable
to
advance
or
to

when
duhaut
rising
from
his
ambuscade
called
out
to
him
to
take
courage
for
he
had
nothing
to
fear
the
murderers

the

exultation
over
the
unconscious
corpse

mockery
and
insult
they
stripped
it
naked
dragged
it
into

left
it

a

in

age

of
the
greatest
men
writes
tonty
of
this
age
without
question
one
of
the
most
remarkable
explorers
whose
names
live
in

his
faithful
officer
joutel
thus
sketches
his
portrait
his
firmness
his
courage
his
great
knowledge
of
the
arts
and
sciences
which
made
him
equal
to
every
undertaking
and
his
untiring
energy
which
enabled
him
to
surmount
every
obstacle
would
have
won
at
last
a
glorious
success
for
his
grand
enterprise
had
not
all
his
fine
qualities
been
counterbalanced
by
a
haughtiness
of
manner
which
often
made
him
insupportable
and
by
a
harshness
towards
those
under
his
command
which
drew
upon
him
an
implacable
hatred
and
was
at
last
the
cause
of
his
death
footnote
the
enthusiasm
of
the
disinterested
and
chivalrous
champlain
was
not
the
enthusiasm
of
la
salle
nor
had
he
any
part
in
the
zeal
of
the
early
jesuit
explorers
he
belonged
not
to
the
age
of
the
errant
and
the
saint
but
to
the
modern
world
of
practical
study
and
practical
action
he
was
the
hero
not
of
a
principle
nor
of
a
faith
but
simply
of
a
fixed
idea
and
a
determined
purpose
as
often
happens
with
concentred
and
energetic
natures
his
purpose
was
to
him
a
passion
and
an
inspiration
and
he
clung
to
it
with
a
certain
fanaticism
of
devotion
it
was
the
offspring
of
an
ambition
vast
and
comprehensive
yet
acting
in
the
interest
both
of
france
and
of
civilization
his
mind
rose
immeasurably
above
the
range
of
the
mere
commercial
speculator
and
in
all
the
invective
and
abuse
of
rivals
and
enemies
it
does
not
appear
that
his
personal
integrity
ever
found
a
challenger
he
was
capable
of
intrigue
but
his
reserve
and
his
haughtiness
were
sure
to
rob
him
at
last
of
the
fruits
of
it
his
schemes
failed
partly
because
they
were
too
vast
and
partly
because
he
did
not
conciliate
the
of
those
whom
he
was
compelled
to
trust
there
were
always
traitors
in
his
ranks
and
his
enemies
were
more
in
earnest
than
his
friends
yet
he
had
friends
and
there
were
times
when
out
of
his
stern
nature
a
stream
of
human
emotion
would
gush
like
water
from
the
rock
in
the
pursuit
of
his
purpose
he
spared
no
man
and
least
of
all
himself
he
bore
the
brunt
of
every
hardship
and
every
danger
but
he
seemed
to
expect
from
all
beneath
him
a
courage
and
endurance
equal
to
his
own
joined
with
an
implicit
deference
to
his
authority
most
of
his
disasters
may
be
ascribed
in
some
measure
to
himself
and
fortune
and
his
own
fault
seemed
always
in
league
to
ruin
him
it
is
easy
to
reckon
up
his
defects
but
it
is
not
easy
to
hide
from
sight
the
roman
virtues
that
redeemed
them
beset
by
a
throng
of
enemies
he
stands
like
the
king
of

above
them
all
he
was
a
tower
of
adamant
against

on

it
is
impossible
to
resist
the
conclusion
that
neither

always
wrote

the
contrary

the
impression

candor

to
whom
cavelier
told
the
story
of
his
brother
death
couture
also
repeats
the
statements
of
one
of
la

followers
undoubtedly
a
parisian
boy
named
barthelemy
who
was
violently
prejudiced
against
his
chief
whom
he
slanders
to
the
utmost
of
his
skill
saying
that
he
was
so
enraged
at
his
failures
that
he
did
not
approach
the
sacraments
for
two
years
that
he
nearly
starved
his
brother
cavelier
allowing
him
only
a
handful
of
meal
a
day
that
he
killed
with
his
own
hand
quantité
de
personnes
who
did
not
work
to
his
liking
and
that
he
killed
the
sick
in
their
beds
without
mercy
under
the
pretence
that
they
were
counterfeiting
sickness
in
order
to
escape
work
these
assertions
certainly
have
no
other
foundation
than
the
undeniable
strictness
and
rigor
of
la
salle
command
douay
says
that
he
confessed
and
made
his
devotions
on
the
morning
of
his
death
while
cavelier
always
speaks
of
him
as
the
hope
and
the

of
the

douay
declares
that
la

lived
an
hour
after
the
fatal
shot
that
he
gave
him
absolution
buried
his
body
and
planted
a
cross
on
his
grave
at
the
time
he
told
joutel
a
different
story
and
the
latter
with
the
best
means
of
learning
the
facts
explicitly
denies
the
friar
printed
statement
couture
on
the
authority
of
cavelier
himself
also
says
that
neither
he
nor
douay
were
permitted
to
take
any
step
for
burying
the
body
tonty
says
that
cavelier
begged
leave
to
do
so
but
was
refused
douay
unwilling
to
place
upon
record
facts
from
which
the
inference
might
easily
be
drawn
that
he
had
been
terrified
from
discharging
his
duty
no
doubt
invented
the
story
of
the
burial
as
well
as
that

the
edifying
behavior
of
moranget
after
he
had
been
struck
in
the
head
with
an
axe
the
locality
of

is
sufficiently
clear
from

comparison
of

it
is
also
indicated

they
succeeded
so
well
in
their
dissembling
that
duhaut
and
his
accomplices
seemed
to
lose
all
distrust

joutel
says
that
they
might
easily
have
avenged
the
death
of

that
of
his
murderers

not
the

duhaut

seized
upon

treated
the

great
contempt

the
most
violent
invectives

directed
by
his
chiefs
to
go
in
advance
of
the
party
to
the
great
cenis
village
for
a
supply
of
food
liotot
himself
with
hiens
and
teissier
declared
that
they
would
go
with
him
and
duhaut
graciously
supplied
him
with
goods
for
barter
joutel
thus
found
himself
in
the
company
of
three
murderers
who
as
he
strongly
suspected
were
contriving
an
opportunity
to
kill
him
but
having
no
choice
he
dissembled
his
doubts
and
set
out
with
his
companions
his
suspicions
seem
to
have
been
groundless
and
after
a
ride
of
ten
leagues
the
travellers
neared
the
indian
town
which
with
its
large
thatched
lodges
looked
like
a
cluster
of
huge
haystacks
their
approach
had
been
made
known
and
they
were
received
in
solemn
state
twelve
of
the
elders
came
to
meet
them
in
their
dress
of
ceremony
each
with
his
face
daubed
red
or
black
and
his
head
adorned
with
painted
plumes
from
their
shoulders
hung
wrought
and
fringed
with
gay
colors
some
carried
some
bows
and
arrows
some
the
blades
of
spanish
rapiers
attached
to
wooden
handles
decorated
with
and
bunches
of
feathers
they
stopped
before
the
honored
guests
and
raising
their
hands
aloft
uttered
howls
so
extraordinary
that
joutel
had
much
ado
to
preserve
the
gravity
which
the
occasion
demanded
having
next
embraced
the
frenchmen
the
elders
conducted
them
into
the
village
attended
by
a
crowd
of
warriors
and
young
men
ushered
them
into
their
a
large
lodge
devoted
to
councils
feasts
dances
and
other
public
assemblies
seated
them
on
mats
and
squatted
in
a
ring
around
them
here
they
were
regaled
with
sagamite
or
indian
porridge
corncake
beans
and
bread
made
of
the
meal
of
parched
corn
then
the
pipe
was
lighted
and
all
smoked
together
the
four
frenchmen
proposed
to
open
a
traffic
for
provisions
and
their
entertainers
grunted
assent
joutel
found
a
frenchman
in
the
village
he
was
a
young
man
from
provence
who
had
deserted
from
la
salle
on
his
last
journey
and
was
now
to
all
appearance
a
savage
like
his
adopted
countrymen
being
naked
like
them
and
affecting
to
have
forgotten
his
native
language
he
was
very
friendly
however
and
invited
the
visitors
to
a
neighboring
village
where
he
lived
and
where
as
he
told
them
they
would
find
a
better
supply
of
corn
they
accordingly
set
out
with
him
escorted
by
a
crowd
of
indians
they
saw
lodges
and
clusters
of
lodges
scattered
along
their
path
at
intervals
each
with
its
field
of
corn
beans
and
pumpkins
rudely
cultivated
with
a
wooden
hoe
reaching
their
destination
which
was
not
far
off
they
were
greeted
with
the
same
honors
as
at
the
first
village
and
the
ceremonial
of
welcome
over
were
lodged
in
the
abode
of
the
savage
frenchman
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
however
that
he
and
his
squaws
of
whom
he
had
a
considerable
number
dwelt
here
alone
for
these
lodges
of
the
cenis
often
contained
fifteen
families
or
more
they
were
made
by
firmly
planting
in
a
circle
tall
straight
young
trees
such
as
grew
in
the
swamps
the
tops
were
then
bent
inward
and
lashed
together
great
numbers
of
were
bound
on
and
the
frame
thus
constructed
was
thickly
covered
with
thatch
a
hole
being
left
at
the
top
for
the
escape
of
the
smoke
the
inmates
were
ranged
around
the
circumference
of
the
structure
each
family
in
a
kind
of
stall
open
in
front
but
separated
from
those
adjoining
it
by
partitions
of
mats
here
they
placed
their
beds
of
cane
their
painted
robes
of
buffalo
and
deer
skin
their
cooking
utensils
of
pottery
and
other
household
goods
and
here
too
the
head
of
the
family
hung
his
bow
quiver
lance
and
shield
there
was
nothing
in
common
but
the
fire
which
burned
in
the
middle
of
the
lodge
and
was
never
suffered
to
go
out
these
dwellings
were
of
great
size
and
joutel
declares
that
he
has
seen
one
sixty
feet
in
diameter

the
lodges
of
the
florida
indians
were
somewhat
similar
the
winter
lodges
of
the
now
nearly
extinct
mandans
though
not
so
high
in
proportion
to
their
width
and
built
of
more
solid
materials
as
the
rigor
of
a
northern
climate
requires
bear
a
general
resemblance
to
those
of
the
cenis
the
cenis
tattooed
their
faces
and
some
parts
of
their
bodies
by
pricking
powdered
charcoal
into
the
skin
the
women
tattooed
the
breasts
and
this
practice
was
general
among
them
notwithstanding
the
pain
of
the
operation
as
it
was
thought
very
ornamental
their
dress
consisted
of
a
sort
of
frock
or
wrapper
of
skin
from
the
waist
to
the
knees
the
men
in
summer
wore
nothing
but
the
it
was
in
one
of
the
largest
that
the
four
travellers
were
now
lodged
a
place
was
assigned
to
them
where
to
bestow
their
baggage
and
they
took
possession
of
their
quarters
amid
the
silent
stares
of
the
whole
community
they
asked
their
renegade
countryman
the
provencal
if
they
were
safe
he
replied
that
they
were
but
this
did
not
wholly
reassure
them
and
they
spent
a
somewhat
wakeful
night
in
the
morning
they
opened
their
budgets
and
began
a
brisk
trade
in
knives
awls
beads
and
other
trinkets
which
they
exchanged
for
corn
and
beans
before
evening
they
had
acquired
a
considerable
stock
and
joutel
three
companions
declared
their
intention
of
returning
with
it
to
the
camp
leaving
him
to
continue
the
trade
they
went
accordingly
in
the
morning
and
joutel
was
left
alone
on
the
one
hand
he
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
them
on
the
other
he
found
his
position
among
the
cenis
very
irksome
and
as
he
thought
insecure
besides
the
provencal
who
had
gone
with
liotot
and
his
companions
there
were
two
other
french
deserters
among
this
tribe
and
joutel
was
very
desirous
to
see
them
hoping
that
they
could
tell
him
the
way
to
the
mississippi
for
he
was
resolved
to
escape
at
the
first
opportunity
from
the
company
of
duhaut
and
his
accomplices
he
therefore
made
the
present
of
a
knife
to
a
young
indian
whom
he
sent
to
find
the
two
frenchmen
and
invite
them
to
come
to
the
village
meanwhile
he
continued
his
barter
but
under
many
difficulties
for
he
could
only
explain
himself
by
signs
and
his
customers
though
friendly
by
day
pilfered
his
goods
by
night
this
joined
to
the
fears
and
troubles
which
burdened
his
mind
almost
deprived
him
of
sleep
and
as
he
confesses
greatly
depressed
his
spirits
indeed
he
had
little
cause
for
cheerfulness
in
the
past
present
or
future
an
old
indian
one
of
the
patriarchs
of
the
tribe
observing
his
dejection
and
anxious
to
relieve
it
one
evening
brought
him
a
young
wife
saying
that
he
made
him
a
present
of
her
she
seated
herself
at
his
side
but
says
joutel
as
my
head
was
full
of
other
cares
and
anxieties
i
said
nothing
to
the
poor
girl
she
waited
for
a
little
time
and
then
finding
that
i
did
not
speak
a
word
she
went
away
late
one
night
he
lay
between
sleeping
and
waking
on
the
that
covered
his
bed
of
canes
all
around
the
great
lodge
its
inmates
were
buried
in
sleep
and
the
fire
that
still
burned
in
the
midst
cast
ghostly
gleams
on
the
trophies
of
savage
chivalry
the
treasured
locks
the
spear
and
and
shield
of
whitened
that
hung
by
each
warrior
such
was
the
weird
scene
that
lingered
on
the
dreamy
eyes
of
joutel
as
he
closed
them
at
last
in
a
troubled
sleep
the
sound
of
a
footstep
soon
wakened
him
and
turning
he
saw
at
his
side
the
figure
of
a
naked
savage
armed
with
a
bow
and
arrows
joutel
spoke
but
received
no
answer
not
knowing
what
to
think
he
reached
out
his
hand
for
his
pistols
on
which
the
intruder
withdrew
and
seated
himself
by
the
fire
thither
joutel
followed
and
as
the
light
fell
on
his
features
he
looked
at
him
closely
his
face
was
tattooed
after
the
cenis
fashion
in
lines
drawn
from
the
top
of
the
forehead
and
converging
to
the
chin
and
his
body
was
decorated
with
similar
embellishments
suddenly
this
supposed
indian
rose
and
threw
his
arms
around
neck
making
himself
known
at
the
same
time
as
one
of
the
frenchmen
who
had
deserted
from
la
salle
and
taken
refuge
among
the
cenis
he
was
a
breton
sailor
named
ruter
his
companion
named
grollet
also
a
sailor
had
been
afraid
to
come
to
the
village
lest
he
should
meet
la
salle
ruter
expressed
surprise
and
regret
when
he
heard
of
the
death
of
his
late
commander
he
had
deserted
him
but
a
few
months
before
that
brief
interval
had
sufficed
to
transform
him
into
a
savage
and
both
he
and
his
companion
found
their
present
reckless
and
ungoverned
way
of
life
greatly
to
their
liking
he
could
tell
nothing
of
the
mississippi
and
on
the
next
day
he
went
home
carrying
with
him
a
present
of
beads
for
his
wives
of
which
last
he
had
made
a
large
collection
in
a
few
days
he
reappeared
bringing
grollet
with
him
each
wore
a
bunch
of
dangling
from
his
head
and
each
had
wrapped
his
naked
body
in
a
blanket
three
men
soon
after
arrived
from
duhaut
camp
commissioned
to
receive
the
corn
which
joutel
had
purchased
they
told
him
that
duhaut
and
liotot
the
tyrants
of
the
party
had
resolved
to
return
to
fort
louis
and
build
a
vessel
to
escape
to
the
west
indies
a
visionary
scheme
writes
joutel
for
our
carpenters
were
all
dead
and
even
if
they
had
been
alive
they
were
so
ignorant
that
they
would
not
have
known
how
to
go
about
the
work
besides
we
had
no
tools
for
it
nevertheless
i
was
obliged
to
obey
and
set
out
for
the
camp
with
the
provisions
on
arriving
he
found
a
wretched
state
of
affairs
douay
and
the
two
caveliers
who
had
been
treated
by
duhaut
with
great
harshness
and
contempt
had
made
their
mess
apart
and
joutel
now
joined
them
this
separation
restored
them
their
freedom
of
speech
of
which
they
had
hitherto
been
deprived
but
it
subjected
them
to
incessant
hunger
as
they
were
allowed
only
food
enough
to
keep
them
from
famishing
douay
says
that
quarrels
were
rife
among
the
assassins
themselves
the
malcontents
being
headed
by
hiens
who
was
enraged
that
duhaut
and
liotot
should
have
engrossed
all
the
plunder
joutel
was
helpless
for
he
had
none
to
back
him
but
two
priests
and
a
boy
he
and
his
companions
talked
of
nothing
around
their
solitary
but
the
means
of
escaping
from
the
villanous
company
into
which
they
were
thrown
they
saw
no
resource
but
to
find
the
mississippi
and
thus
make
their
way
to
canada
a
prodigious
undertaking
in
their
forlorn
condition
nor
was
there
any
probability
that
the
assassins
would
permit
them
to
go
these
on
their
part
were
beset
with
difficulties
they
could
not
return
to
civilization
without
manifest
peril
of
a
halter
and
their
only
safety
was
to
turn
buccaneers
or
savages
duhaut
however
still
held
to
his
plan
of
going
back
to
fort
louis
and
joutel
and
his
companions
who
with
good
reason
stood
in
daily
fear
of
him
devised
among
themselves
a
simple
artifice
to
escape
from
his
company
the
elder
cavelier
was
to
tell
him
that
they
were
too
fatigued
for
the
journey
and
wished
to
stay
among
the
cenis
and
to
beg
him
to
allow
them
a
portion
of
the
goods
for
which
cavelier
was
to
give
his
note
of
hand
the
old
priest
whom
a
sacrifice
of
truth
even
on
less
important
occasions
cost
no
great
effort
accordingly
opened
the
negotiation
and
to
his
own
astonishment
and
that
of
his
companions
gained
the
assent
of
duhaut
their
joy
however
was
short
for
ruter
the
french
savage
to
whom
joutel
had
betrayed
his
intention
when
inquiring
the
way
to
the
mississippi
told
it
to
duhaut
who
on
this
changed
front
and
made
the
ominous
declaration
that
he
and
his
men
would
also
go
to
canada
joutel
and
his
companions
were
now
filled
with
alarm
for
there
was
no
likelihood
that
the
assassins
would
permit
them
the
witnesses
of
their
crime
to
reach
the
settlements
alive
in

called
to

the
buccaneer
returned
a
sullen
answer
he
then
accosted
duhaut
telling
him
that
he
had
no
mind
to
go
up
the
mississippi
with
him
and
demanding
a
share
of
the
goods
duhaut
replied
that
the
goods
were
his
own

owed
him
money
so
you
will
not

the
less
did
they
glory
in
their
prowess
and
several
days
were
spent
in
ceremonies
and
feasts
of
triumph
footnote
these
are
described
by
joutel
like
nearly
all
the
early
observers
of
indian
manners
he
speaks
of
the
practice
of
cannibalism
when
all
this
hubbub
of
rejoicing
had
subsided
joutel
and
his
companions
broke
to
hiens
their
plan
of
attempting
to
reach
home
by
way
of
the
mississippi
as
they
had
expected
he
opposed
it
vehemently
declaring
that
for
his
own
part
he
would
not
run
such
a
risk
of
losing
his
head
but
at
length
he
consented
to
their
departure
on
condition
that
the
elder
cavelier
should
give
him
a
certificate
of
his
entire
innocence
of
the
murder
of
la
salle
which
the
priest
did
not
hesitate
to
do
for
the
rest
hiens
treated
his
departing
with
the
generosity
of
a
successful
freebooter
for
he
gave
them
a
good
share
of
the
plunder
which
he
had
won
by
his
late
crime
supplying
them
with
hatchets
knives
heads
and
other
articles
of
trade
besides
several
horses
meanwhile
adds
joutel
we
had
the
mortification
and
chagrin
of
seeing
this
scoundrel
walking
about
the
camp
in
a
scarlet
coat
laced
with
gold
which
had
belonged
to
the
late
monsieur
de
la
salle
and
which
lie
had
seized
upon
as
also
upon
all
the
rest
of
his
property
a
shot
would
have
avenged
the
wrong
but
joutel
was
clearly
a
mild
and
moderate
person
and
the
elder
cavelier
had
constantly
opposed
all
plans
of
violence
therefore
they
stifled
their
emotions
and
armed
themselves
with
patience
joutel
party
consisted
besides
himself
of
the
caveliers
uncle
and
nephew
anastase
douay
de
marie
teissier
and
a
young
parisian
named
barthelemy
teissier
an
accomplice
in
the
murders
of
moranget
and
la
salle
had
obtained
a
pardon
in
form
from
the
elder
cavelier
they
had
six
horses
and
three
cenis
guides
hiens
embraced
them
at
parting
as
did
the
ruffians
who
remained
with
him
their
course
was
towards
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
a
distant
goal
the
way
to
which
was
beset
with
so
many
dangers
that
their
chance
of
reaching
it
seemed
small
it
was
early
in
june
and
the
forests
and
prairies
were
green
with
the
verdure
of
opening
summer
they
soon
reached
the
assonis
a
tribe
near
the
sabine
who
received
them
well
and
gave
them
guides
to
the
nations
dwelling
towards
red
river
on
the
they
approached
a
village
the
inhabitants
of
which
regarding
them
as
curiosities
of
the
first
order
came
out
in
a
body
to
see
them
and
eager
to
do
them
honor
required
them
to
mount
on
their
backs
and
thus
make
their
entrance
in
procession
joutel
being
large
and
heavy
weighed
down
his
bearer
insomuch
that
two
of
his
countrymen
were
forced
to
sustain
him
one
on
each
side
on
arriving
an
old
chief
washed
their
faces
with
warm
water
from
an
earthen
pan
and
then
invited
them
to
mount
on
a
scaffold
of
canes
where
they
sat
in
the
hot
sun
listening
to
four
successive
speeches
of
welcome
of
which
they
understood
not
a
word

these
indians
were

was
here
two
years

mentions
the
curious
custom
of
washing
the
faces
of
guests
at
the
village
of
another
tribe
farther
on

they
met
with
a
welcome
still
more
oppressive

the
unworthy
successor
of
his

being
represented
as
the
chief
of
the
party
became
the
principal
victim
of
their
attentions
they
danced
the
calumet
before
him
while
an
indian
taking
him
with
an
air
of
great
respect
by
the
shoulders
as
he
sat
shook
him
in
cadence
with
the
thumping
of
the
drum
they
then
placed
two
girls
close
beside
him
as
his
wives
while
at
the

time
an
old
chief
tied
a
painted
feather
in
his
hair
these
proceedings
so
scandalized
him
that
pretending
to
be
ill
he
broke
off
the
ceremony
but
they
continued
to
sing
all
night
with
so
much
zeal
that
several
of
them
were
reduced
to
a
state
of
complete
exhaustion

about
two
months

stood
at

nestled
beneath

saw
the

here
as
they
gazed
across
the
broad
current
they
presently
descried
an
object
which
nerved
their
spent
limbs
and
thrilled
their
homesick
hearts
with
joy
it
was
a
tall
wooden
cross
and
near
it
was
a
small
house
built
evidently
by
christian
hands

one
accord

fell
on

to

on

marked
on

eleven

in
ascending
it
in

large
and
heavy
wooden
canoe

at
length
on
the
afternoon
of

fourteenth
of

they
saw
towering
above
the
forest
and
the
river
the
cliff
crowned
with
the
palisades
of
fort
louis
of
the
illinois
as
they
drew
near
a
troop
of
indians
headed
by
a
frenchman
descended
from
the
rock
and
fired
their
guns
to
salute
them
they
landed
and
followed
the
forest
path
that
led
towards
the
fort

they
were
met
by
boisrondet
tonty
comrade
in
the
iroquois
war

two
other
frenchmen

no

saw

they
called
out
demanding
where
was

and
his

would
lose

which
they

determined
to
conceal
his
death
and
joutel
as
he
himself
confesses
took
part
in
the
deceit
substituting
equivocation
for
falsehood
they
replied
that
he
had
been
with
them
nearly
as
far
as
the
cenis
villages
and
that
when
they
parted
he
was
in
good
health
this
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
was
literally
speaking
true
but
douay
and
teissier
the
one
a
witness
and
the
other
a
sharer
in
his
death
could
not
have
said
so
much
without
a
square
falsehood
and
therefore
evaded
the
inquiry
threading
the
forest
path
and
circling
to
the
rear
of
the
rock
they
climbed
the
rugged
height
and
reached
the
top
here
they
saw
an
area
encircled
by
the
palisades
that
fenced
the
brink
of
the
cliff
and
by
several
dwellings

storehouse

the
condition

be
gathered

passages

houses

built
at

great
anxiety

told
that

on
his
way
to
the

asked
many
questions
and
could
not
hide
his
agitation

some

had
partially
recovered
he
left

justify
the
suspicion
that
jesuit
influence
had
some
connection
with

treacherous

that
this

drawn

rude
manner

marked

but
the
return
route
is
incorrect
the
whole

is
so
crude
and
careless
and
based
on
information
so
inexact
that
it
is
of
little
interest
the
jesuits
made
also
another
map
without
title
of
the
four
upper
lakes
and
the
mississippi
to
a
little
below
the
arkansas
the
mississippi
is
called
riuuiere
colbert
the
map
is
remarkable
as
including
the
earliest
representation
of
the
upper
mississippi
based
perhaps
on
the
reports
of
indians
the
falls
of
anthony
are
indicated
by
the
word
saut
it
is
possible
that
the
map
may
be
of
later
date
than
at
first
appears
and
that
it
may
have
been
drawn
in
the
interval
between
the
return
of
hennepin
from
the
upper
mississippi
and
that
of
la

from
his
discovery
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
the
various
temporary
and
permanent
stations
of
the
jesuits
are
marked
by
crosses
of
far
greater
interest
is
the
small
map
of
louis
joliet
made
and
presented
to
count
frontenac
immediately
after
the
discoverer

states
that

this
map
which
is
inscribed
with
a
dedication
by
the
intendant
duchesneau
to
the
minister
colbert
was
made
some
time
after
the
voyage
of
joliet
and
marquette
it
is
an
elaborate
piece
of
work
but
very
inaccurate
it
represents
the
continent
from
hudson
strait
to
mexico
and
california
with
the
whole
of
the
atlantic
and
a
part
of
the
pacific

an
open

is
made
to
extend
from
hudson

westward
to
the
pacific
the

and
all
the
great

are
laid
down
with
tolerable
correctness
as
also
is
the

the
mississippi
called
messasipi

from
which
it
extends
northward
nearly
to

is
a
long
list
of
indian
tribes
most
of
which
can
not
now
be
recognized
though
several
are
clearly
of
the
sioux
the
ohio
is
called
ouaboustikou
the
whole
map
is
decorated
with
numerous
figures
of
animals
natives
of
the
country
or
supposed
to
be
so
among
them
are
camels
ostriches
and
a
giraffe
which
are
placed
on
the
plains
west
of
the

but
the
most
curious
figure
is
that
which
represents
one
of
the
monsters
seen
by
joliet
and
marquette
painted
on
a
rock
by
the
indians
it
corresponds
with
marquette
description
this
map
if
really
the
work
of
joliet
does
more
credit
to
his
skill
as
a
designer
than
to
his
geographical
knowledge
which
appears
in
some
respects
behind
his
time
a
map
made
by
raudin
count
frontenac
engineer
may
be
mentioned
here
he
calls
the
mississippi
riviere

from
the
family
name
of
his
patron
and
christens
all
the
adjoining
region
frontenacie
or
frontenacia
in
the
bibliothèque
impériale
is
the
rude
map
of
the
jesuit
raffeix
made
at
about
the
same
time
it
is
chiefly
interesting
as
marking
out
the
course
of
du
lhut
on
his
journeys
from
the
head
of
lake
superior
to
the
mississippi
and
as
confirming
a
part
of
the
narrative
of
hennepin
who
raffeix
says
in
a
note
was
rescued
by
du
lhut
it
also
marks
out
the
journeys
of
la
salle
in
we
now
come
to
the
great
map
of
franquelin
the
most
remarkable
of
all
the
early
maps
of
the
interior
of
north
america
though
hitherto
completely
ignored
by
both
american
and
canadian
writers
it
is
entitled

franquelin
was
a
young
engineer
who
held
the
post
of
hydrographer
to
the
king
at
quebec
in
which
joliet
succeeded
him
several
of
his
maps
are
preserved
including
one
made
in
in
which
he
lays
down
the
course
of
the
mississippi
the
lower
part
from
conjecture
making
it
discharge
itself
into
mobile
bay
it
appears
from
a
letter
of
the
governor
la
barre
that
franquelin
was
at
quebec
in
engaged
on
a
map
which
was
probably
that
of
which
the
title
is
given
above
though
had
la
barre
known
that
it
was
to
be
called
a
map
of
the
journeys
of
his
victim
la
salle
he
would
have
been
more
sparing
of
his
praises
he
franquelin
writes
the
governor
is
as
skilful
as
any
in
france
but
extremely
poor
and
in
need
of
a
little
aid
from
his
majesty
as
an
engineer
he
is
at
work
on
a
very
correct
map
of
the
country
which
i
shall
send
you
next
year
in
his
name
meanwhile
i
shall
support

the
map
is
very
elaborately
executed
and
is
six
feet
long
and
four
and
a
half
wide
it
exhibits
the
political
divisions
of
the

as
the
french
then
understood
them
that
is
to
say
all
the
regions
drained
by
streams
flowing
into
the

and
the

are
claimed
as
belonging
to
france
and
this
vast
domain
is
separated
into
two
grand
divisions
la

and
la

the
boundary
line
of
the
former
new

is
drawn
from
the
penobscot
to
the
southern
extremity
of
lake
champlain
and
thence
to
the
mohawk
which
it
crosses
a
little
above

in
order
to
make
french

thence
it

by

a
name
which
had
once
been
given
to

many
smaller

are
designated
by
names
which
have
been
entirely
forgotten
the
nomenclature
differs
materially
from
that
of
coronelli
map
published
four
years
later
here
the
whole
of
the
french
territory
is
laid
down
as

ou
la

of
which
la

forms
an
integral
part
the

of

like
that
of

makes
two
distinct
provinces
of

one
is
styled
canada

the
other
la

the
latter
including
michigan
and
the
greater
part
of
new

franquelin
gives
the
shape
of
hudson
bay
and
of
all
the
great
lakes
with
remarkable
accuracy
he
makes
the
mississippi
bend
much
too
far
to
the
west
the
peculiar
sinuosities
of
its
course
are
indicated
and
some
of
its
bends
as
for
example
that
at
new
orleans
are
easily
recognized
its
mouths
are
represented
with
great
minuteness
and
it
may
be
inferred
from
the
map
that
since
la
salle
time
they
have
advanced
considerably
into
the
sea
perhaps
the
most
interesting
feature
in
franquelin
map
is
his
sketch
of
la
salle
evanescent
colony
on
the
illinois
engraved
for
this
volume
he
reproduced
the
map
in
for
presentation
to
the
king
with
the
title
de
septentrionale
depuis
le
degré
de
latitude
et
environ
et
degrés
de
longitude
in
this
map
franquelin
corrects
various
errors
in
that
which
preceded
one
of
these
corrections
consists
in
the
removal
of
a
branch
of
the
river
illinois
which
he
had
marked
on
his
first
map
as
will
be
seen
by
referring
to
the
portion
of
it
in
this
book
but
which
does
not
in
fact
exist
on
this
second
map
la
salle
colony
appears
in
much
diminished
proportions
his
indian
settlements
having
in
good
measure
dispersed
the
remarkable
manuscript
map
of
the
upper
mississippi
by
le
sueur
belongs
to
a
period
subsequent
to
the
close
of
this
narrative
appendix
ii
the
eldorado
of
mathieu
sâgean
father
hennepin
had
among
his
contemporaries
two
rivals
in
the
fabrication
of
new
discoveries
the
first
was
the
noted
la
hontan
whose
book
like
his
own
had
a
wide
circulation
and
proved
a
great
success
la
hontan
had
seen
much
and
portions
of
his
story
have
a
substantial
value
but
his
account
of
his
pretended
voyage
up
the
long
river
is
a
sheer
fabrication
his
long
river
corresponds
in
position
with
the
peter
but
it
corresponds
in
nothing
else
and
the
populous
nations
whom
he
found
on
it
the
eokoros
the
esanapes
and
the
gnacsitares
no
less
than
their
neighbors
the
mozeemlek
and
the
tahuglauk
are
as
real
as
the
nations
visited
by
captain
gulliver
but
la
hontan
did
not
like
hennepin
add
slander
and
plagiarism
to
mendacity
or
seek
to
appropriate
to
himself
the
credit
of
genuine
discoveries
made
by
others
mathieu
sâgean
is
a
personage
less
known
than
hennepin
or
la
hontan
for
though
he
surpassed
them
both
in
fertility
of
invention
he
was
illiterate
and
never
made
a
book
in
being
then
a
soldier
in
a
company
of
marines
at
brest
he
revealed
a
secret
which
he
declared
that
he
had
locked
within
his
breast
for
twenty
years
having
been
unwilling
to
impart
it
to
the
dutch
and
english
in
whose
service
he
had
been
during
the
whole
period
his
story
was
written
down
from
his
dictation
and
sent
to
the
minister
ponchartrain
it
is
preserved
in
he
bibliothèque
impériale
and
in
it
was
printed
by
shea
sâgean
underwent
an
examination
which
resulted
in
his
being
sent
to
biloxi
near
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
with
instructions
from
the
minister
that
he
should
be
supplied
with
the
means
of
conducting
a
party
of
canadians
to
the
wonderful
country
which
he
had
discovered
but
on
his
arrival
the
officers
in
command
becoming
satisfied
that
he
was
an
impostor
suffered
the
order
to
remain
unexecuted
his
story
was
as
follows
he
was
born
at
la
chine
in
canada
and
engaged
in
the
service
of
la
salle
about
twenty
years
before
the
revelation
of
his
secret
that
is
in
hence
he
would
have
been
at
the
utmost
only
fourteen
years
old
as
la
chine
did
not
exist
before
he
was
with
la
salle
at
the
building
of
fort
louis
of
the
illinois
and
was
left
here
as
one
of
a
hundred
men
under
command
of
tonty
tonty
it
is
to
be
observed
had
but
a
small
fraction
of
this
number
and
sâgean
describes
the
fort
in
a
manner
which
shows
that
he
never
saw
it
being
desirous
of
making
some
new
discovery
he
obtained
leave
from
tonty
and
set
out
with
eleven
other
frenchmen
and
two
mohegan
indians
they
ascended
the
mississippi
a
hundred
and
fifty
leagues
carried
their
canoes
by
a
cataract
went
forty
leagues
farther
and
stopped
a
month
to
hunt
while
thus
employed
they
found
another
river
fourteen
leagues
distant
flowing
they
carried
their
canoes
thither
meeting
on
the
way
many
lions
leopards
and
tigers
which
did
them
no
harm
then
they
embarked
paddled
a
hundred
and
fifty
leagues
farther
and
found
themselves
in
the
midst
of
the
great
nation
of
the
acanibas
dwelling
in
many
fortified
towns
and
governed
by
king
hagaren
who
claimed
descent
from
montezuma
the
king
like
his
subjects
was
clothed
with
the
skins
of
men
nevertheless
he
and
they
were
civilized
and
polished
in
their
manners
they
worshipped
certain
frightful
idols
of
gold
in
the
royal
palace
one
of
them
represented
the
ancestor
of
their
monarch
armed
with
lance
bow
and
quiver
and
in
the
act
of
mounting
his
horse
while
in
his
mouth
he
held
a
jewel
as
large
as
a
goose
egg
which
shone
like
fire
and
which
in
the
opinion
of
sâgean
was
a
carbuncle
another
of
these
images
was
that
of
a
woman
mounted
on
a
golden
unicorn
with
a
horn
more
than
a
fathom
long
after
passing
pursues
the
story
between
these
idols
which
stand
on
platforms
of
gold
each
thirty
feet
square
one
enters
a
magnificent
vestibule
conducting
to
the
apartment
of
the
king
at
the
four
corners
of
this
vestibule
are
stationed
bands
of
music
which
to
the
taste
of
sâgean
was
of
very
poor
quality
the
palace
is
of
vast
extent
and
the
private
apartment
of
the
king
is
or
thirty
feet
square
the
walls
to
the
height
of
eighteen
feet
being
of
bricks
of
solid
gold
and
the
pavement
of
the
same
here
the
king
dwells
alone
served
only
by
his
wives
of
whom
he
takes
a
new
one
every
day
the
frenchmen
alone
had
the
privilege
of
entering
and
were
graciously
received
these
people
carry
on
a
great
trade
in
gold
with
a
nation
believed
by
sâgean
to
be
the
japanese
as
the
journey
to
them
lasts
six
months
he
saw
the
departure
of
one
of
the
caravans
which
consisted
of
more
than
three
thousand
oxen
laden
with
gold
and
an
equal
number
of
horsemen
armed
with
lances
bows
and
daggers
they
receive
iron
and
steel
in
exchange
for
their
gold
the
king
has
an
army
of
a
hundred
thousand
men
of
whom
are
cavalry
they
have
golden
trumpets
with
which
they
make
very
indifferent
music
and
also
golden
drums
which
as
well
as
the
drummer
are
carried
on
the
backs
of
oxen
the
troops
are
practised
once
a
week
in
shooting
at
a
target
with
arrows
and
the
king
rewards
the
victor
with
one
of
his
wives
or
with
some
honorable
employment
these
people
are
of
a
dark
complexion
and
hideous
to
look
upon
because
their
faces
are
made
long
and
narrow
by
pressing
their
heads
between
two
boards
in
infancy
the
women
however
are
as
fair
as
in
europe
though
in
common
with
the
men
their
ears
are
enormously
large
all
persons
of
distinction
among
the
acanibas
wear
their
very
long
they
are
polygamists
and
each
man
takes
as
many
wives
as
he
wants
they
are
of
a
joyous
disposition
moderate
drinkers
but
great
smokers
they
entertained
sâgean
and
his
followers
during
five
months
with
the
fat
of
the
land
and
any
woman
who
refused
a
frenchman
was
ordered
to
be
killed
six
girls
were
put
to
death
with
daggers
for
this
breach
of
hospitality
the
king
being
anxious
to
retain
his
visitors
in
his
service
offered
sâgean
one
of
his
daughters
aged
fourteen
years
in
marriage
and
when
he
saw
him
resolved
to
depart
promised
to
keep
her
for
him
till
he
should
return
the
climate
is
delightful
and
summer
reigns
throughout
the
year
the
plains
are
full
of
birds
and
animals
of
all
kinds
among
which
are
many
parrots
and
monkeys
besides
the
wild
cattle
with
humps
like
camels
which
these
people
use
as
beasts
of
burden
king
hagaren
would
not
let
the
frenchmen
go
till
they
had
sworn
by
the
sky
which
is
the
customary
oath
of
the
acanibas
that
they
would
return
in
moons
and
bring
him
a
supply
of
beads
and
other
trinkets
from
canada
as
gold
was
to
be
had
for
the
asking
each
of
the
eleven
frenchmen
took
away
with
him
sixty
small
bars
weighing
about
four
pounds
each
the
king
ordered
two
hundred
horsemen
to
escort
them
and
carry
the
gold
to
their
canoes
which
they
did
and
then
bade
them
farewell
with
terrific
howlings
meant
doubtless
to
do
them
honor
after
many
adventures
wherein
nearly
all
his
companions
came
to
a
bloody
end
sâgean
and
the
few
others
who
survived
had
the
ill
luck
to
be
captured
by
english
pirates
at
the
mouth
of
the
lawrence
he
spent
many
years
among
them
in
the
east
and
west
indies
but
would
not
reveal
the
secret
of
his
eldorado
to
these
heretical
foreigners
such
was
the
story
which
so
far
imposed
on
the
credulity
of
the
minister
ponchartrain
as
to
persuade
him
that
the
matter
was
worth
serious
examination
accordingly
sâgean
was
sent
to
louisiana
then
in
its
earliest
infancy
as
a
french
colony
here
he
met
various
persons
who
had
known
him
in
canada
who
denied
that
he
had
ever
been
on
the
mississippi
and
contradicted
his
account
of
his
parentage
nevertheless
he
held
fast
to
his
story
and
declared
that
the
gold
mines
of
the
acanibas
could
be
reached
without
difficulty
by
the
river
missouri
but
sauvolle
and
bieuville
chiefs
of
the
colony
were
obstinate
in
their
unbelief
and
sâgean
and
his
king
hagaren
lapsed
alike
into
oblivion
