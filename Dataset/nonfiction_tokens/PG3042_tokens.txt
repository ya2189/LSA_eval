chapter
i
the
heritage
from
spain
and
portugal
at
the
time
of
the
american
revolution
most
of
the
new
world
still
belonged
to
spain
and
portugal
whose
captains
and
conquerors
had
been
the
first
to
come
to
its
shores
spain
had
the
lion
share
but
portugal
held
brazil
in
itself
a
vast
land
of
unsuspected
resources
no
empire
mankind
had
ever
yet
known
rivaled
in
size
the
illimitable
domains
of
spain
and
portugal
in
the
new
world
and
none
displayed
such
remarkable
contrasts
in
land
and
people
boundless
plains
and
forests
swamps
and
deserts
mighty
mountain
chains
torrential
streams
and
majestic
rivers
marked
the
surface
of
the
country
this
vast
territory
stretched
from
the
temperate
prairies
west
of
the
mississippi
down
to
the
steaming
lowlands
of
central
america
then
up
through
tablelands
in
the
southern
continent
to
high
plateaus
miles
above
sea
level
where
the
sun
blazed
and
the
cold
dry
air
was
hard
to
breathe
and
then
higher
still
to
the
lofty
peaks
of
the
andes
clad
in
eternal
snow
or
pouring
fire
and
smoke
from
their
summits
in
the
clouds
and
thence
to
the
lower
temperate
valleys
grassy
pampas
and
undulating
hills
of
the
far
south
scattered
over
these
vast
colonial
domains
in
the
western
world
were
somewhere
between
and
people
subject
to
spain
and
perhaps
to
portugal
the
great
majority
of
them
were
indians
and
negroes
the
latter
predominating
in
the
lands
bordering
on
the
caribbean
sea
and
along
the
shores
of
brazil
possibly
of
the
inhabitants
came
of
european
stock
including
not
only
spaniards
and
their
descendants
but
also
the
folk
who
spoke
english
in
the
floridas
and
french
in
louisiana
during
the
centuries
which
had
elapsed
since
the
entry
of
the
spaniards
and
portuguese
into
these
regions
an
extraordinary
fusion
of
races
had
taken
place
white
red
and
black
had
mingled
to
such
an
extent
that
the
bulk
of
the
settled
population
became
only
in
the
more
temperate
regions
of
the
far
north
and
south
where
the
aborigines
were
comparatively
few
or
had
disappeared
altogether
did
the
whites
remain
racially
distinct
socially
the
indian
and
the
negro
counted
for
little
they
constituted
the
laboring
class
on
whom
all
the
burdens
fell
and
for
whom
advantages
in
the
body
politic
were
scant
legally
the
indian
under
spanish
rule
stood
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
his
white
fellows
and
many
a
gifted
native
came
to
be
reckoned
a
force
in
the
community
though
his
social
position
remained
a
subordinate
one
most
of
the
negroes
were
slaves
and
were
more
kindly
treated
by
the
spaniards
than
by
the
portuguese
though
divided
among
themselves
the
europeans
were
everywhere
politically
dominant
the
spaniard
was
always
an
individualist
besides
he
often
brought
from
the
old
world
petty
provincial
traditions
which
were
intensified
in
the
new
the
inhabitants
of
towns
many
of
which
had
been
founded
quite
independently
of
one
another
knew
little
about
their
remote
neighbors
and
often
were
quite
willing
to
convert
their
ignorance
into
prejudice
the
dweller
in
the
uplands
and
the
resident
on
the
coast
were
wont
to
view
each
other
with
disfavor
the
one
was
thought
heavy
and
stupid
the
other
frivolous
and
lazy
native
spaniards
regarded
the
creoles
or
american
born
as
persons
who
had
degenerated
more
or
less
by
their
contact
with
the
aborigines
and
the
wilderness
for
their
part
the
creoles
looked
upon
the
spaniards
as
upstarts
and
intruders
whose
sole
claim
to
consideration
lay
in
the
privileges
dispensed
them
by
the
home
government
in
testimony
of
this
attitude
they
coined
for
their
oversea
kindred
numerous
nicknames
which
were
more
expressive
than
complimentary
while
the
creoles
held
most
of
the
wealth
and
of
the
lower
offices
the
spaniards
enjoyed
the
perquisites
and
emoluments
of
the
higher
posts
though
objects
of
disdain
to
both
these
masters
the
indians
generally
preferred
the
spaniard
to
the
creole
the
spaniard
represented
a
distant
authority
interested
in
the
welfare
of
its
humbler
subjects
and
came
less
into
actual
daily
contact
with
the
natives
while
it
would
hardly
be
correct
to
say
that
the
spaniard
was
viewed
as
a
protector
and
the
creole
as
an
oppressor
yet
the
aborigines
unconsciously
made
some
such
hazy
distinction
if
indeed
they
did
not
view
all
europeans
with
suspicion
and
dislike
in
brazil
the
relation
of
classes
was
much
the
same
except
that
here
the
native
element
was
much
less
conspicuous
as
a
social
factor
these
distinctions
were
all
the
more
accentuated
by
the
absence
both
of
other
european
peoples
and
of
a
definite
middle
class
of
any
race
everywhere
in
the
areas
tenanted
originally
by
spaniards
and
portuguese
the
european
of
alien
stock
was
unwelcome
even
though
he
obtained
a
grudging
permission
from
the
home
governments
to
remain
a
colonist
in
brazil
owing
to
the
close
commercial
connections
between
great
britain
and
portugal
foreigners
were
not
so
rigidly
excluded
as
in
spanish
america
the
spaniard
was
unwilling
that
lands
so
rich
in
natural
treasures
should
be
thrown
open
to
exploitation
by
others
even
if
the
newcomer
professed
the
catholic
faith
the
heretic
was
denied
admission
as
a
matter
of
course
had
the
foreigner
been
allowed
to
enter
the
risk
of
such
exploitation
doubtless
would
have
been
increased
but
a
middle
class
might
have
arisen
to
weld
the
the
discordant
factions
into
a
society
which
had
common
desires
and
aspirations
with
the
development
of
commerce
and
industry
with
the
growth
of
activities
which
bring
men
into
touch
with
each
other
in
everyday
affairs
something
like
a
solidarity
of
sentiment
might
have
been
awakened
in
its
absence
the
only
bond
among
the
dominant
whites
was
their
sense
of
superiority
to
the
colored
masses
beneath
them
manual
labor
and
trade
had
never
attracted
the
spaniards
and
the
portuguese
the
army
the
church
and
the
law
were
the
three
callings
that
offered
the
greatest
opportunity
for
distinction
agriculture
grazing
and
mining
they
did
not
disdain
provided
that
superintendence
and
not
actual
work
was
the
main
requisite
the
economic
organization
which
the
spaniards
and
portuguese
established
in
america
was
naturally
a
more
or
less
faithful
reproduction
of
that
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
at
home
agriculture
and
grazing
became
the
chief
occupations
domestic
animals
and
many
kinds
of
plants
brought
from
europe
throve
wonderfully
in
their
new
home
huge
estates
were
the
rule
small
farms
the
exception
on
the
ranches
and
plantations
vast
droves
of
cattle
sheep
and
horses
were
raised
as
well
as
immense
crops
mining
once
so
much
in
vogue
had
become
an
occupation
of
secondary
importance
on
their
estates
the
planter
the
ranchman
and
the
mine
owner
lived
like
feudal
overlords
waited
upon
by
indian
and
negro
peasants
who
also
tilled
the
fields
tended
the
droves
and
dug
the
earth
for
precious
metals
and
stones
originally
the
natives
had
been
forced
to
work
under
conditions
approximating
actual
servitude
but
gradually
the
harsher
features
of
this
system
had
given
way
to
a
mode
of
service
closely
resembling
peonage
paid
a
pitifully
small
wage
provided
with
a
hut
of
reeds
or
sundried
mud
and
a
tiny
patch
of
soil
on
which
to
grow
a
few
hills
of
the
corn
and
beans
that
were
his
usual
nourishment
the
ordinary
indian
or
laborer
was
scarcely
more
than
a
beast
of
burden
a
creature
in
whom
civic
virtues
of
a
high
order
were
not
likely
to
develop
if
he
betook
himself
to
the
town
his
possible
usefulness
lessened
in
proportion
as
he
fell
into
drunken
or
dissolute
habits
or
lapsed
into
a
state
of
lazy
and
vacuous
dreaminess
enlivened
only
by
chatter
or
the
rolling
of
a
cigarette
on
the
other
hand
when
employed
in
a
capacity
where
native
talent
might
be
tested
he
often
revealed
a
power
of
action
which
if
properly
guided
could
be
turned
to
excellent
account
as
a
cowboy
for
example
he
became
a
capital
horseman
brave
alert
skillful
and
daring
commerce
with
portugal
and
spain
was
long
confined
to
yearly
fairs
and
occasional
trading
fleets
that
plied
between
fixed
points
but
when
liberal
decrees
threw
open
numerous
ports
in
the
mother
countries
to
traffic
and
the
several
colonies
were
given
also
the
privilege
of
exchanging
their
products
among
themselves
the
volume
of
exports
and
imports
increased
and
gave
an
impetus
to
activity
which
brought
a
notable
release
from
the
torpor
and
vegetation
characterizing
earlier
days
yet
even
so
communication
was
difficult
and
irregular
by
sea
the
distances
were
great
and
the
vessels
slow
overland
the
natural
obstacles
to
transportation
were
so
numerous
and
the
methods
of
conveyance
so
cumbersome
and
expensive
that
the
people
of
one
province
were
practically
strangers
to
their
neighbors
matters
of
the
mind
and
of
the
soul
were
under
the
guardianship
of
the
church
more
than
merely
a
spiritual
mentor
it
controlled
education
and
determined
in
large
measure
the
course
of
intellectual
life
possessed
of
vast
wealth
in
lands
and
revenues
its
monasteries
and
priories
its
hospitals
and
asylums
its
residences
of
ecclesiastics
were
the
finest
buildings
in
every
community
adorned
with
the
masterpieces
of
sculptors
and
painters
a
village
might
boast
of
only
a
few
squalid
huts
yet
there
in
the
plaza
or
central
square
loomed
up
a
massively
imposing
edifice
of
worship
its
towers
pointing
heavenward
the
sign
and
symbol
of
triumphant
power
the
church
in
fact
was
the
greatest
civilizing
agency
that
spain
and
portugal
had
at
their
disposal
it
inculcated
a
reverence
for
the
monarch
and
his
ministers
and
fostered
a
sentiment
of
conservatism
which
made
disloyalty
and
innovation
almost
sacrilegious
in
the
spanish
colonies
in
particular
the
church
not
only
protected
the
natives
against
the
rapacity
of
many
a
white
master
but
taught
them
the
rudiments
of
the
christian
faith
as
well
as
useful
arts
and
trades
in
remote
places
secluded
so
far
as
possible
from
contact
with
europeans
missionary
pioneers
gathered
together
groups
of
neophytes
whom
they
rendered
docile
and
industrious
it
is
true
but
whom
they
often
deprived
of
initiative
and
selfreliance
and
kept
illiterate
and
superstitious
education
was
reserved
commonly
for
members
of
the
ruling
class
as
imparted
in
the
universities
and
schools
it
savored
strongly
of
medievalism
though
some
attention
was
devoted
to
the
natural
sciences
experimental
methods
were
not
encouraged
and
found
no
place
in
lectures
and
textbooks
books
periodicals
and
other
publications
came
under
ecclesiastical
inspection
and
a
vigilant
censorship
determined
what
was
fit
for
the
public
to
read
supreme
over
all
the
colonial
domains
was
the
government
of
their
majesties
the
monarchs
of
spain
and
portugal
a
ministry
and
a
council
managed
the
affairs
of
the
inhabitants
of
america
and
guarded
their
destinies
in
accordance
with
the
theories
of
enlightened
despotism
then
prevailing
in
europe
the
spanish
dominions
were
divided
into
viceroyalties
and
subdivided
into
captaincies
general
presidencies
and
intendancies
associated
with
the
high
officials
who
ruled
them
were
audiencias
or
boards
which
were
at
once
judicial
and
administrative
below
these
individuals
and
bodies
were
a
host
of
lesser
functionaries
who
like
their
superiors
held
their
posts
by
appointment
in
brazil
the
governor
general
bore
the
title
of
viceroy
and
carried
on
the
administration
assisted
by
provincial
captains
supreme
courts
and
local
officers
this
control
was
by
no
means
so
autocratic
as
it
might
seem
portugal
had
too
many
interests
elsewhere
and
was
too
feeble
besides
to
keep
tight
rein
over
a
territory
so
vast
and
a
population
so
much
inclined
as
the
brazilian
to
form
itself
into
provincial
units
jealous
of
the
central
authority
spain
on
its
part
had
always
practised
the
good
old
roman
rule
of
divide
and
govern
its
policy
was
to
hold
the
balance
among
officials
civil
and
ecclesiastical
and
inhabitants
white
and
colored
it
knew
how
strongly
individualistic
the
spaniard
was
and
realized
the
full
force
of
the
adage
i
obey
but
i
do
not
fulfill
legislatures
and
other
agencies
of
government
directly
representative
of
the
people
did
not
exist
in
spanish
or
portuguese
america
the
spanish
cabildo
or
town
council
however
afforded
an
opportunity
for
the
expression
of
the
popular
will
and
often
proved
intractable
its
membership
was
appointive
elective
hereditary
and
even
purchasable
but
the
form
did
not
affect
the
substance
the
spanish
americans
had
an
instinct
for
politics
here
all
men
govern
declared
one
of
the
viceroys
the

more
part
in
political
discussions

in
any
other

chapter
ii
our

the
movement
which
led
eventually
to
the
emancipation
of
the
colonies
differed
from
the
local
uprisings
which
occurred
in
various
parts
of
south
america
during
the
eighteenth
century
either
the
arbitrary
conduct
of
individual
governors
or
excessive
taxation
had
caused
the
earlier
revolts
to
the
final
revolution
foreign
nations
and
foreign
ideas
gave
the
necessary
impulse
a
few
members
of
the
intellectual
class
had
read
in
secret
the
writings
of
french
and
english
philosophers
others
had
traveled
abroad
and
came
home
to
whisper
to
their
countrymen
what
they
had
seen
and
heard
in
lands
more
progressive
than
spain
and
portugal
the
commercial
relations
both
licit
and
illicit
which
great
britain
had
maintained
with
several
of
the
colonies
had
served
to
diffuse
among
them
some
notions
of
what
went
on
in
the
busy
world
outside
by
gaining
its
independence
the
united
states
had
set
a
practical
example
of
what
might
be
done
elsewhere
in
america
translated
into
french
the
declaration
of
independence
was
read
and
commented
upon
by
enthusiasts
who
dreamed
of
the
possibility
of
applying
its
principles
in
their
own
lands
more
powerful
still
were
the
ideas
liberated
by
the
french
revolution
and
napoleon
borne
across
the
ocean
the
doctrines
of
liberty
fraternity
equality
stirred
the
to
thoughts
of
action
though
the
spanish
and
portuguese
americans
who
schemed
and
plotted
were
the
merest
handful
the
seed
they
planted
was
slow
to
germinate
among
peoples
who
had
been
taught
to
regard
things
foreign
as
outlandish
and
heretical
many
years
therefore
elapsed
before
the
ideas
of
the
few
became
the
convictions
of
the
masses
for
the
conservatism
and
loyalty
of
the
common
people
were
unbelieveably
steadfast
not
spanish
and
portuguese
america
but
santo
domingo
an
island
which
had
been
under
french
rule
since
and
which
was
tenanted
chiefly
by
ignorant
and
brutalized
negro
slaves
was
the
scene
of
the
first
effectual
assertion
of
independence
in
the
lands
originally
colonized
by
spain
rising
in
revolt
against
their
masters
the
negroes
had
won
complete
control
under
their
remarkable
commander
toussaint
when
napoleon
bonaparte
then
first
consul
decided
to
restore
the
old
regime
but
the
huge
expedition
which
was
sent
to
reduce
the
island
ended
in
absolute
failure
after
a
ruthless
racial
warfare
characterized
by
ferocity
on
both
sides
the
french
retired
in
the
negro
leaders
proclaimed
the
independence
of
the
island
as
the
republic
of
haiti
under
a
president
who
appreciative
of
the
example
just
set
by
napoleon
informed
his
followers
that
he
too
had
assumed
the
august
title
of
emperor
his
immediate
successor
in
african
royalty
was
the
notorious
henri
christophe
who
gathered
about
him
a
nobility
garish
in
color
and
taste
including
their
sable
lordships
the
duke
of
marmalade
and
the
count
of
lemonade
and
who
built
the
palace
of
sans
souci
and
the
countryseats
of
queen
delight
and
beautiful
view
about
which
cluster
tales
of
barbaric
pleasure
that
rival
the
grim
legends
clinging
to
the
parapets
and
enshrouding
the
dungeons
of
his
mountain
fortress
of
la
ferriere
none
of
these
black
or
mulatto
potentates
however
could
expel
french
authority
from
the
eastern
part
of
santo
domingo
that
task
was
taken
in
hand
by
the
inhabitants
themselves
and
in
they
succeeded
in
restoring
the
control
of
spain
meanwhile
events
which
had
been
occurring
in
south
america
prepared
the
way
for
the
movement
that
was
ultimately
to
banish
the
flags
of
both
spain
and
portugal
from
the
continents
of
the
new
world
as
the
one
country
had
fallen
more
or
less
tinder
the
influence
of
france
so
the
other
had
become
practically
dependent
upon
great
britain
interested
in
the
expansion
of
its
commerce
and
viewing
the
outlying
possessions
of
peoples
who
submitted
to
french
guidance
as
legitimate
objects
for
seizure
great
britain
in
wrested
trinidad
from
the
feeble
grip
of
spain
and
thus
acquired
a
strategic
position
very
near
south
america
itself
haiti
trinidad
and
jamaica
in
fact
all
became
centers
of
revolutionary
agitation
and
havens
of
refuge
for
spanish
american
radicals
in
the
troublous
years
to
follow
foremost
among
the
early
conspirators
was
the
venezuelan
francisco
de
miranda
known
to
his
fellow
americans
of
spanish
stock
as
the
precursor
napoleon
once
remarked
of
him
he
is
a
don
quixote
with
this
difference
he
is
not
crazy
the
man
has
sacred
fire
in
his
soul
an
officer
in
the
armies
of
spain
and
of
revolutionary
france
and
later
a
resident
of
london
miranda
devoted
thirty
years
of
his
adventurous
life
to
the
cause
of
independence
for
his
countrymen
with
officials
of
the
british
government
he
labored
long
and
zealously
eliciting
from
them
vague
promises
of
armed
support
and
some
financial
aid
it
was
in
london
also
that
he
organized
a
group
of
sympathizers
into
the
secret
society
called
the
grand
lodge
of
america
with
it
or
with
its
branches
in
france
and
spain
many
of
the
leaders
of
the
subsequent
revolution
came
to
be
identified
in
availing
himself
of
the
negligence
of
the
united
states
and
having
the
connivance
of
the
british
authorities
in
trinidad
miranda
headed
two
expeditions
to
the
coast
of
venezuela
he
had
hoped
that
his
appearance
would
be
the
signal
for
a
general
uprising
instead
he
was
treated
with
indifference
his
countrymen
seemed
to
regard
him
as
a
tool
of
great
britain
and
no
one
felt
disposed
to
accept
the
blessings
of
liberty
under
that
guise
humiliated
but
not
despairing
miranda
returned
to
london
to
await
a
happier
day
two
british
expeditions
which
attempted
to
conquer
the
region
about
the
rio
de
la
plata
in
and
were
also
frustrated
by
this
same
stubborn
loyalty
when
the
spanish
viceroy
fled
the
inhabitants
themselves
rallied
to
the
defense
of
the
country
and
drove
out
the
invaders
thereupon
the
people
of
buenos
aires
assembled
in
cabildo
abierto
or
town
meeting
deposed
the
viceroy
and
chose
their
victorious
leader
in
his
stead
until
a
successor
could
be
regularly
appointed
then
in
fell
the
blow
which
was
to
shatter
the
bonds
uniting
spain
to
its
continental
dominions
in
america
the
discord
and
corruption
which
prevailed
in
that
unfortunate
country
afforded
napoleon
an
opportunity
to
oust
its
feeble
king
and
his
incompetent
son
ferdinand
and
to
place
joseph
bonaparte
on
the
throne
but
the
master
of
europe
underestimated
the
fighting
ability
of
spaniards
instead
of
humbly
complying
with
his
mandate
they
rose
in
arms
against
the
usurper
and
created
a
central
junta
or
revolutionary
committee
to
govern
in
the
name
of
ferdinand
vii
as
their
rightful
ruler
the
news
of
this
french
aggression
aroused
in
the
colonies
a
spirit
of
resistance
as
vehement
as
that
in
the
mother
country
both
spaniards
and
creoles
repudiated
the
intruder
king
believing
as
did
their
comrades
oversea
that
ferdinand
was
a
helpless
victim
in
the
hands
of
napoleon
they
recognized
the
revolutionary
government
and
sent
great
sums
of
money
to
spain
to
aid
in
the
struggle
against
the
french
envoys
from
joseph
bonaparte
seeking
an
acknowledgment
of
his
rule
were
angrily
rejected
and
were
forced
to
leave
the
situation
on
both
sides
of
the
ocean
was
now
an
extraordinary
one
just
as
the
junta
in
spain
had
no
legal
right
to
govern
so
the
officials
in
the
colonies
holding
their
posts
by
appointment
from
a
deposed
king
had
no
legal
authority
and
the
people
would
not
allow
them
to
accept
new
commissions
from
a
usurper
the
church
too
detesting
napoleon
as
the
heir
of
a
revolution
that
had
undermined
the
catholic
faith
and
regarding
him
as
a
godless
despot
who
had
made
the
pope
a
captive
refused
to
recognize
the
french
pretender
until
ferdinand
vii
could
be
restored
to
his
throne
therefore
the
colonists
had
to
choose
whether
they
would
carry
on
the
administration
under
the
guidance
of
the
authorities
in
spain
or
should
themselves
create
similar
organizations
in
each
of
the
colonies
to
take
charge
of
affairs
the
former
course
was
favored
by
the
official
element
and
its
supporters
among
the
conservative
classes
the
latter
by
the
liberals
who
felt
that
they
had
as
much
right
as
the
people
of
the
mother
country
to
choose
the
form
of
government
best
suited
to
their
interests
each
party
viewed
the
other
with
distrust
opposition
to
the
more
democratic
procedure
it
was
felt
could
mean
nothing
less
than
secret
submission
to
the
pretensions
of
joseph
bonaparte
whereas
the
establishment
in
america
of
any
organizations
like
those
in
spain
surely
indicated
a
spirit
of
disloyalty
toward
ferdinand
vii
himself
under
circumstances
like
these
when
the
junta
and
its
successor
the
council
of
regency
refused
to
make
substantial
concessions
to
the
colonies
both
parties
were
inevitably
drifting
toward
independence
in
the
phrase
of
manuel
belgrano
one
of
the
great
leaders
in
the
viceroyalty
of
la
plata
our
old
king
or
none
became
the
watchword
that
gradually
shaped
the
thoughts
of
spanish
americans
when
therefore
in
the
news
came
that
the
french
army
had
overrun
spain
democratic
ideas
so
long
cherished
in
secret
and
propagated
so
industriously
by
miranda
and
his
followers
at
last
found
expression
in
a
series
of
uprisings
in
the
four
viceroyalties
of
la
plata
peru
new
granada
and
new
spain
but
in
each
of
these
viceroyalties
the
revolution
ran
a
different
course
sometimes
it
was
the
capital
city
that
led
off
sometimes
a
provincial
town
sometimes
a
group
of
individuals
in
the
country
districts
among
the
actual
participants
in
the
various
movements
very
little
harmony
was
to
be
found
here
a
particular
leader
claimed
obedience
there
a
board
of
magistrates
held
sway
elsewhere
a
town
or
province
refused
to
acknowledge
the
central
authority
to
add
to
these
complications
in
a
revolutionary
cortes
or
legislative
body
assembled
at
cadiz
adopted
for
spain
and
its
dominions
a
constitution
providing
for
direct
representation
of
the
colonies
in
oversea
administration
since
arrangements
of
this
sort
contented
many
of
the
spanish
americans
who
had
protested
against
existing
abuses
they
were
quite
unwilling
to
press
their
grievances
further
given
all
these
evidences
of
division
in
activity
and
counsel
one
does
not
find
it
difficult
to
foresee
the
outcome
on
may

agitation

buenos

the
spanish
viceroy
of
la

to
resign

thereupon

opposition
broke
out
immediately
the
northern
and
eastern
parts
of

themselves
quite
unwilling
to
obey
these
upstarts
meantime
urged
on
by
radicals
who
revived
the
jacobin
doctrines
of
revolutionary
france
the
junta
strove
to
suppress
in
rigorous
fashion
any
symptoms
of
disaffection
but
it
could
do
nothing
to

tide
of

and
actuated
by

this

was
reunited

most
of
the
former
viceroyalty
of

had
thus
to
all

purposes
thrown
off
the
yoke
of

chile
was
the
only
other
province
that
for
a
while
gave
promise
of
similar
action
here
again
it
was
the
capital
city
that
took
the
lead
on
receipt
of
the
news
of
the
occurrences
at
buenos

in
may
the
people
of
santiago
forced
the
captain
general
to
resign
and
on
the
of

replaced

by

junta
of
their
own
choosing
but
neither
this
body
nor
its
successors
nor
even
the
congress
that
assembled
the
following
year
could
establish
a
permanent
and
effective
government
nowhere
in
spanish
america
perhaps
did
the
lower
classes
count
for
so
little
and
the
upper
class
for
so
much
as
in
chile
though
the
great
landholders
were
disposed
to
favor
a
reasonable
amount
of
local
autonomy
for
the
country
they
refused
to
heed
the
demands
of
the
radicals
for
complete
independence
and
the
establishment
of
a
republic
accordingly
in
proportion
as
their
opponents
resorted
to
measures
of
compulsion
the
gentry
gradually
withdrew
their
support
and
offered
little
resistance
when
troops
dispatched
by
the
viceroy
of
peru
restored
the
spanish
regime
in
the
irreconcilable
among
the
patriots
fled
over
the
andes
to
the
western
part
of
la
plata
where
they
found
hospitable
refuge
but
of
all
the
spanish
dominions
in
south
america
none
witnessed
so
desperate
a
struggle
for
emancipation
as
the
viceroyalty
of
new
granada
learning
of
the
catastrophe
that
had
befallen
the
mother
country
the
leading
citizens
of
caracas
acting
in
conjunction
with
the
cabildo
deposed
the
captain
general
on
april
and
created
a
junta
in
his
stead
the
example
was
quickly
followed
by
most
of
the
smaller
divisions
of
the
province
then
when
miranda
returned
from
england
to
head
the
revolutionary
movement
a
congress
on
july
declared
venezuela
independent
of
spain
carried
away
also
by
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
and
forgetful
of
the
utter
unpreparedness
of
the
country
the
congress
promulgated
a
federal
constitution
modeled
on
that
of
the
united
states
which
set
forth
all
the
approved
doctrines
of
the
rights
of
man
neither
miranda
nor
his
youthful
coadjutor
simon
bolivar
soon
to
become
famous
in
the
annals
of
spanish
american
history
approved
of
this
plunge
into
democracy
ardent
as
their
patriotism
was
they
knew
that
the
country
needed
centralized
control
and
not
experiments
in
confederation
or
theoretical
liberty
they
speedily
found
out
also
that
they
could
not
count
on
the
support
of
the
people
at
large
then
almost
as
if
nature
herself
disapproved
of
the
whole
proceeding
a
frightful
earthquake
in
the
following
year
shook
many
a
venezuelan
town
into
ruins
everywhere
the
royalists
took
heart
dissensions
broke
out
between
miranda
and
his
subordinates
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
the
old
warrior
himself
was
sent
away
to
die
in
a
spanish
dungeon
and
so
the
earthquake
republic
collapsed
but
the
rigorous
measures
adopted
by
the
royalists
to
sustain
their
triumph
enabled
bolivar
to
renew
the
struggle
in
he
entered
upon
a
campaign
which
was
signalized
by
acts
of
barbarity
on
both
sides
his
declaration
of
war
to
the
death
was
answered
in
kind
wholesale
slaughter
of
prisoners
indiscriminate
pillage
and
wanton
destruction
of
property
spread
terror
and
desolation
throughout
the
country
acclaimed
liberator
of
venezuela
and
made
dictator
by
the
people
of
caracas
bolivar
strove
in
vain
to
overcome
the
llaneros
or
cowboys
of
the
plains
who
despised
the
innovating
aristocrats
of
the
capital
though
he
won
a
few
victories
he
did
not
make
the
cause
of
independence
popular
and
realizing
his
failure
he
retired
into
new
granada
in
this
region
an
astounding
series
of
revolutions
and
had
taken
place
unmindful
of
pleas
for
cooperation
the
creole
leaders
in
town
and
district
from
onward
seized
control
of
affairs
in
a
fashion
that
betokened
a
speedy
disintegration
of
the
country
though
the
viceroy
was
deposed
and
a
general
congress
was
summoned
to
meet
at
the
capital
bogota
efforts
at
centralization
encountered
opposition
in
every
quarter
only
the
royalists
managed
to
preserve
a
semblance
of
unity
separate
republics
sprang
into
being
and
in
declared
their
independence
of
spain
presidents
and
congresses
were
pitted
against
one
another
towns
fought
among
themselves
even
parishes
demanded
local
autonomy
for
a
while
the
services
of
bolivar
were
invoked
to
force
rebellious
areas
into
obedience
to
the
principle
of
confederation
but
with
scant
result
unable
to
agree
with
his
fellow
officers
and
displaying
traits
of
moral
weakness
which
at
this
time
as
on
previous
occasions
showed
that
he
had
not
yet
risen
to
a
full
sense
of
responsibility
the
liberator
renounced
the
task
and
fled
to
jamaica
the
scene
now
shifts
northward
to
the
viceroyalty
of
new
spain
unlike
the
struggles
already
described
the
uprisings
that
began
in
in
central
mexico
were
substantially
revolts
of
indians
and
against
white
domination
on
the
of
september
a
crowd
of
natives
rose
under
the
leadership
of
miguel
hidalgo
a
parish
priest
of
the
village
of
dolores
bearing
on
their
banners
the
slogan
long
live
ferdinand
vii
and
down
with
bad
government
the
undisciplined
crowd
soon
to
number
tens
of
thousands
aroused
such
terror
by
their
behavior
that
the
whites
were
compelled
to
unite
in
it
mattered
not
whether
hidalgo
hoped
to
establish
a
republic
or
simply
to
secure
for
his
followers
relief
from
oppression
in
either
case
the
whites
could
expect
only
indian
domination
before
the
trained
forces
of
the
whites
a
horde
of
natives
so
ignorant
of
modern
warfare
that
some
of
them
tried
to
stop
cannon
balls
by
clapping
their
straw
hats
over
the
mouths
of
the
guns
could
not
stand
their
ground
hidalgo
was
captured
and
shot
but
he
was
succeeded
by
jose
maria
morelos
also
a
priest
reviving
the
old
aztec
name
for
central
mexico
he
summoned
a
congress
of
anahuac
which
in
asserted
that
dependence
on
the
throne
of
spain
was
forever
broken
and
dissolved
abler
and
more
humane
than
hidalgo
he
set
up
a
revolutionary
government
that
the
authorities
of
mexico
failed
for
a
while
to
suppress
in
therefore
spain
still
held
the
bulk
of
its
dominions
trinidad
to
be
sure
had
been
lost
to
great
britain
and
both
louisiana
and
west
florida
to
the
united
states
royalist
control
furthermore
had
ceased
in
parts
of
the
viceroyalties
of
la
plata
and
new
granada
to
regain
trinidad
and
louisiana
was
hopeless
but
a
wise
policy
conciliation
or
an
overwhelming
display
of
armed
force
might
yet
restore
spanish
rule
where
it
had
been
merely
suspended
very
different
was
the
course
of
events
in
brazil
strangely
enough
the
first
impulse
toward
independence
was
given
by
the
portuguese
royal
family
terrified
by
the
prospective
invasion
of
the
country
by
a
french
army
late
in
the
prince
regent
the
royal
family
and
a
host
of
portuguese
nobles
and
commoners
took
passage
on
british
vessels
and
sailed
to
rio
de
janeiro
brazil
thereupon
became
the
seat
of
royal
government
and
immediately
assumed
an
importance
which
it
could
never
have
attained
as
a
mere
dependency
acting
under
the
advice
of
the
british
minister
the
prince
regent
threw
open
the
ports
of
the
colony
to
the
ships
of
all
nations
friendly
to
portugal
gave
his
sanction
to
a
variety
of
reforms
beneficial
to
commerce
and
industry
and
even
permitted
a
printing
press
to
be
set
up
though
only
for
official
purposes
from
all
these
benevolent
activities
brazil
derived
great
advantages
on
the
other
hand
the
prince
regent
aversion
to
popular
education
or
anything
that
might
savor
of
democracy
and
the
greed
of
his
followers
for
place
and
distinction
alienated
his
colonial
subjects
they
could
not
fail
to
contrast
autocracy
in
brazil
with
the
liberal
ideas
that
had
made
headway
elsewhere
in
spanish
america
as
a
consequence
a
spirit
of
unrest
arose
which
boded
ill
for
the
maintenance
of
portuguese
rule
chapter
iii
independence
or
death
the
restoration
of
ferdinand
vii
to
his
throne
in
encouraged
the
liberals
of
spain
no
less
than
the
loyalists
of
spanish
america
to
hope
that
the
old
king
would
now
grant
a
new
dispensation
freedom
of
commerce
and
a
fair
measure
of
popular
representation
in
government
it
was
believed
would
compensate
both
the
mother
country
for
the
suffering
which
it
had
undergone
during
the
peninsular
war
and
the
colonies
for
the
trials
to
which
loyalty
had
been
subjected
but
ferdinand
vii
was
a
typical
bourbon
nothing
less
than
an
absolute
reestablishment
of
the
earlier
regime
would
satisfy
him
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
therefore
the
liberals
were
forced
into
opposition
to
the
crown
although
they
were
so
far
apart
that
they
could
not
cooperate
with
each
other
independence
was
to
be
the
fortune
of
the
spanish
americans
and
a
continuance
of
despotism
for
a
while
the
lot
of
the
spaniards
as
the
region
of
the
viceroyalty
of
la
plata
had
been
the
first
to
cast
off
the
authority
of
the
home
government
so
it
was
the
first
to
complete
its
separation
from
spain
despite
the
fact
that
disorder
was
rampant
everywhere
and
that
most
of
the
local
districts
could
not
or
would
not
send
deputies
a
congress
that
assembled
at
tucuman
voted
on
july
to
declare
the
united
provinces
in
south
america
independent
comprehensive
though
the
expression
was
it
applied
only
to
the
central
part
of
the
former
viceroyalty
and
even
there
it
was
little
more
than
an
aspiration
mistrust
of
the
authorities
at
buenos
aires
insistence
upon
provincial
autonomy
failure
to
agree
upon
a
particular
kind
of
republican
government
and
a
lingering
inclination
to
monarchy
made
progress
toward
national
unity
impossible
in
to
be
sure
a
constitution
was
adopted
providing
for
a
centralized
government
but
in
the
country
at
large
it
encountered
too
much
resistance
from
those
who
favored
a
federal
government
to
become
effective
in
the
banda
oriental
over
most
of
which
artigas
and
his
horsemen
held
sway
chaotic
conditions
invited
aggression
from
the
direction
of
brazil
this
east
bank
of
the
uruguay
had
long
been
disputed
territory
between
spain
and
portugal
and
now
its
definite
acquisition
by
the
latter
seemed
an
easy
undertaking
instead
however
the
task
turned
out
to
be
a
truly
formidable
one
montevideo

of

at

soon
capitulated
but
four
years
elapsed
before
the

be
subdued
artigas
fled
to

where
he
fell
into
the
clutches
of

never

in

fearful
lest

with
the
outer
world
might

his
tenacious
grip
upon
his
subjects
whom
he
terrorized
into
obedience
he
barred

to

and
suffered
no
one
to

he
organized
and
drilled
an
army
obedient
to
his
when
he
went
forth
by
day
attended
by
an
escort
of
cavalry
the
doors
and
windows
of

had
to

kept
closed
and
no

was
allowed

in

changing
his

frequently
to
avoid

that

the
public

he
forbade

he
prohibited

as
to
reduce

attained
his
object
paraguay
became
a
quiet
state
whatever
might
be
said
of
its
neighbors
elsewhere
in
southern
spanish
america
a
brilliant
feat
of
arms
brought
to
the
fore
its
most
distinguished
soldier
this
was
jose
de
san
martin
of
la
plata
like
miranda
he
had
been
an
officer
in
the
spanish
army
and
had
returned
to
his
native
land
an
ardent
apostle
of
independence
quick
to
realize
the
fact
that
so
long
as
chile
remained
under
royalist
control
the
possibility
of
an
attack
from
that
quarter
was
a
constant
menace
to
the
safety
of
the
newly
constituted
republic
he
conceived
the
bold
plan
of
organizing
near
the
western
frontier
an
army
composed
partly
of
chilean
refugees
and
partly
of
his
own
countrymen
with
which
he
proposed
to
cross
the
andes
and
meet
the
enemy
on
his
own
ground
among
these
fugitives
was
the
able
and
valiant
bernardo
son
of
an
irish
officer
who
had
been
viceroy
of
peru
cooperating
with
san
martin
fixed
his
headquarters
at
mendoza
and
began
to
gather
and
train
the
four
thousand
men
whom
he
judged
needful
for
the
enterprise
by
january
the
army
of
the
andes
was
ready
to
cross
the
mountains
meant
to
transport
men
horses
artillery
and
stores
to
an
altitude
of
thirteen
thousand
feet
where
the
uspallata
pass
afforded
an
outlet
to
chilean
soil
this
pass
was
nearly
a
mile
higher
than
the
great
bernard
in
the
alps
the
crossing
of
which
gave
napoleon
bonaparte
such
renown
on
the
of
february
the
hosts
of
san
martin
hurled
themselves
upon
the
royalists
entrenched
on
the
slopes
of
chacabuco
and
routed
them
utterly
the
battle
proved
decisive
not
of
the
fortunes
of
chile
alone
but
of
those
of
all
spanish
south
america
as
a
viceroy
of
peru
later
confessed
it
marked
the
moment
when
the
cause
of
spain
in
the
indies
began
to
recede
named
supreme
director
by
the
people
of
santiago
fought
vigorously
though
ineffectually
to
drive
out
the
royalists
who
reinforced
from
peru
held
the
region
south
of
the
capital
that
he
failed
did
not
deter
him
from
having
a
vote
taken
under
military
auspices
on
the
strength
of
which
on
february
he
declared
chile
an
independent
nation
the
date
of
the
proclamation
being
changed
to
the
of
january
so
as
to
make
the
inauguration
of
the
new
era
coincident
with
the
entry
of
the
new
year
san
martin
meanwhile
had
been
collecting
reinforcements
with
which
to
strike
the
final
blow
on
the
of
april
the
battle
of
maipo
gave
him
the
victory
he
desired
except
for
a
few
isolated
points
to
the
southward
the
power
of
spain
had
fallen
until
the
fall
of
napoleon
in
it
had
been
the
native
loyalists
who
had
supported
the
cause
of
the
mother
country
in
the
spanish
dominions
henceforth
free
from
the
menace
of
the
european
dictator
spain
could
look
to
her
affairs
in
america
and
during
the
next
three
years
dispatched
thousand
men
to
bring
the
colonies
to
obedience
these
soldiers
began
their
task
in
the
northern
part
of
south
america
and
there
they
ended
it
in
failure
to
this
failure
the
defection
of
native
royalists
contributed
for
they
were
alienated
not
so
much
by
the
presence
of
the
spanish
troops
as
by
the
often
merciless
severity
that
marked
their
conduct
the
atrocities
may
have
been
provoked
by
the
behavior
of
their
opponents
but
be
this
as
it
may
the
patriots
gained
recruits
after
each
victory
a
spanish
army
of
more
than
ten
thousand
under
the
command
of
pablo
morillo
arrived
in
venezuela
in
april
he
found
the
province
relatively
tranquil
and
even
disposed
to
welcome
the
full
restoration
of
royal
government
leaving
a
garrison
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
military
occupation
morillo
sailed
for
cartagena
the
key
to
new
granada
besieged
by
land
and
sea
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
maintained
for
upwards
of
three
months
a
resistance
which
in
its
heroism
privation
and
sacrifice
recalled
the
memorable
defense
of
saragossa
in
the
mother
country
against
the
french
seven
years
before
with
cartagena
taken
regulars
and
loyalists
united
to
stamp
out
the
rebellion
elsewhere
at
bogoth
in
particular
the
new
spanish
viceroy
installed
by
morillo
waged
a
savage
war
on
all
suspected
of
aiding
the
patriot
cause
he
did
not
spare
even
women
and
one
of
his
victims
was
a
young
heroine
policarpa
salavarrieta
by
name
though
for
her
execution
three
thousand
soldiers
were
detailed
the
girl
was
unterrified
by
her
doom
and
was
earnestly
beseeching
the
loyalists
among
them
to
turn
their
arms
against
the
enemies
of
their
country
when
a
volley
stretched
her
lifeless
on
the
ground
meanwhile
bolivar
had
been
fitting
out
in
haiti
and
in
the
dutch
island
of
curacao
an
expedition
to
take
up
anew
the
work
of
freeing
venezuela
hardly
had
the
liberator
landed
in
may
when
dissensions
with
his
fellow
officers
frustrated
any
prospect
of
success
indeed
they
obliged
him
to
seek
refuge
once
more
in
haiti
eventually
however
most
of
the
patriot
leaders
became
convinced
that
if
they
were
to
entertain
a
hope
of
success
they
must
entrust
their
fortunes
to
bolivar
as
supreme
commander
their
chances
of
success
were
increased
furthermore
by
the
support
of
the
llaneros
who
had
been
won
over
to
the
cause
of
independence
under
their
redoubtable
chieftain
jose
antonio
paez
these
fierce
and
ruthless
horsemen
performed
many
a
feat
of
valor
in
the
campaigns
which
followed
once
again
on
venezuelan
soil
bolivar
determined
to
transfer
his
operations
to
the
eastern
part
of
the
country
which
seemed
to
offer
better
strategic
advantages
than
the
region
about
caracas
but
even
here
the
jealousy
of
his
officers
the
insubordination
of
the
free
lances
the
stubborn
resistance
of
the
loyalists
upheld
by
the
wealthy
and
conservative
classes
and
the
able
generalship
of
morillo
who
had
returned
from
new
granada
made
the
situation
of
the
liberator
all
through
and
extremely
precarious
happily
for
his
fading
fortunes
his
hands
were
strengthened
from
abroad
the
united
states
had
recognized
the
belligerency
of
several
of
the
revolutionary
governments
in
south
america
and
had
sent
diplomatic
agents
to
them
great
britain
had
blocked
every
attempt
of
ferdinand
vii
to
obtain
help
from
the
holy
alliance
in
reconquering
his
dominions
and
ferdinand
had
contributed
to
his
own
undoing
by
failing
to
heed
the
urgent
requests
of
morillo
for
reinforcements
to
fill
his
dwindling
ranks
more
decisive
still
were
the
services
of
some
five
thousand
british
irish
french
and
german
volunteers
who
were
often
the
mainstay
of
bolivar
and
his
lieutenants
during
the
later
phases
of
the
struggle
both
in
venezuela
and
elsewhere
for
some
time
the
liberator
had
been
evolving
a
plan
of
attack
upon
the
royalists
in
new
granada
similar
to
the
offensive
campaign
which
san
martin
had
conducted
in
chile
more
than
that
he
had
conceived
the
idea
once
independence
had
been
attained
of
uniting
the
western
part
of
the
viceroyalty
with
venezuela
into
a
single
republic
the
latter
plan
he
laid
down
before
a
congress
which
assembled
at
angostura
in
february
and
which
promptly
chose
him
president
of
the
republic
and
vested
him
with
the
powers
of
dictator
in
june
at
the
head
of
men
he
started
on
his
perilous
journey
over
the
andes
up
through
the
passes
and
across
bleak
plateaus
the
little
army
struggled
till
it
reached
the
banks
of
the
rivulet
of
boyaca
in
the
very
heart
of
new
granada
here
on
the
of
august
bolivar
inflicted
on
the
royalist
forces
a
tremendous
defeat
that
gave
the
deathblow
to
the
domination
of
spain
in
northern
south
america
on
his
triumphal
return
to
angostura
the
congress
signalized
the
victory
by
declaring
the
whole
of
the
viceroyalty
an
independent
state
under
the
name
of
the
republic
of
colombia
and
chose
the
liberator
as
its
provisional
president
two
years
later
a
fundamental
law
it
had
adopted
was
ratified
with
certain
changes
by
another
congress
assembled
at
rosario
de
cucuta
and
bolivar
was
made
permanent
president
southward
of
colombia
lay
the
viceroyalty
of
peru
the
oldest
richest
and
most
conservative
of
the
larger
spanish
dominions
on
the
continent
intact
except
for
the
loss
of
chile
it
had
found
territorial
compensation
by
stretching
its
power
over
the
provinces
of
quito
and
charcas
the
one
wrenched
off
from
the
former
new
granada
the
other
torn
away
from
what
had
been
la
plata
predominantly
royalist
in
sentiment
it
was
like
a
huge
wedge
thrust
in
between
the
two
independent
areas
by
thus
cutting
off
the
patriots
of
the
north
from
their
comrades
in
the
south
it
threatened
both
with
destruction
of
their
liberty
again
fortune
intervened
from
abroad
this
time
directly
from
spain
itself
ferdinand
vii
who
had
gathered
an
army
of
twenty
thousand
men
at
cadiz
was
ready
to
deliver
a
crushing
blow
at
the
colonies
when
in
january
a
mutiny
among
the
troops
and
revolution
throughout
the
country
entirely
frustrated
the
plan
but
although
that
reactionary
monarch
was
compelled
to
accept
the
constitution
of
the
spanish
liberals
were
unwilling
to
concede
to
their
fellows
in
america
anything
more
substantial
than
representation
in
the
cortes
independence
they
would
not
tolerate
on
the
other
hand
the
example
of
the
mother
country
in
arms
against
its
king
in
the
name
of
liberty
could
not
fail
to
give
heart
to
the
cause
of
liberation
in
the
provinces
oversea
and
to
hasten
its
achievement
the
first
important
efforts
to
profit
by
this
situation
were
made
by
the
patriots
in
chile
both
san
martin
and
had
perceived
that
the
only
effective
way
to
eliminate
the
peruvian
wedge
was
to
gain
control
of
its
approaches
by
sea
the
chileans
had
already
won
some
success
in
this
direction
when
the
fiery
and
imperious
scotch
sailor
thomas
cochrane
earl
of
dundonald
appeared
on
the
scene
and
offered
to
organize
a
navy
at
length
a
squadron
was
put
under
his
command
with
upwards
of
four
thousand
troops
in
charge
of
san
martin
the
expedition
set
sail
for
peru
late
in
august
while
cochrane
busied
himself
in
destroying
the
spanish
blockade
his
comrade
in
arms
marched
up
to
the
very
gates
of
lima
the
capital
and
everywhere
aroused
enthusiasm
for
emancipation
when
negotiations
which
had
been
begun
by
the
viceroy
and
continued
by
a
special
commissioner
from
spain
failed
to
swerve
the
patriot
leader
from
his
demand
for
a
recognition
of
independence
the
royalists
decided
to
evacuate
the
town
and
to
withdraw
into
the
mountainous
region
of
the
interior
san
martin
thereupon
entered
the
capital
at
the
head
of
his
army
of
liberation
and
summoned
the
inhabitants
to
a
town
meeting
at
which
they
might
determine
for
themselves
what
action
should
be
taken
the
result
was
easily
foreseen
on
july
peru
was
declared
independent
and
a
few
days
later
san
martin
was
invested
with
supreme
command
under
the
title
of
protector
but
the
triumph
of
the
new
protector
did
not
last
long
for
some
reason
he
failed
to
understand
that
the
withdrawal
of
the
royalists
from
the
neighborhood
of
the
coast
was
merely
a
strategic
retreat
that
made
the
occupation
of
the
capital
a
more
or
less
empty
performance
this
blunder
and
a
variety
of
other
mishaps
proved
destined
to
blight
his
military
career
unfortunate
in
the
choice
of
his
subordinates
and
unable
to
retain
their
confidence
accused
of
irresolution
and
even
of
cowardice
abandoned
by
cochrane
who
sailed
off
to
chile
and
left
the
army
stranded
incapable
of
restraining
his
soldiers
from
indulgence
in
the
pleasures
of
lima
now
severe
now
lax
in
an
administration
that
alienated
the
sympathies
of
the
influential
class
san
martin
was
indeed
an
unhappy
figure
it
soon
became
clear
that
he
must
abandon
all
hope
of
ever
conquering
the
citadel
of
spanish
power
in
south
america
unless
he
could
prevail
upon
bolivar
to
help
him
a
junction
of
the
forces
of
the
two
great
leaders
was
perfectly
feasible
after
the
last
important
foothold
of
the
spaniards
on
the
coast
of
venezuela
had
been
broken
by
the
battle
of
carabobo
on
july
whether
such
a
union
would
be
made
however
depended
upon
two
things
the
ultimate
disposition
of
the
province
of
quito
lying
between
colombia
and
peru
and
the
attitude
which
bolivar
and
san
martin
themselves
should
assume
toward
each
other
a
revolution
of
the
previous
year
at
the
seaport
town
of
guayaquil
in
that
province
had
installed
an
independent
government
which
besought
the
liberator
to
sustain
its
existence
prompt
to
avail
himself
of
so
auspicious
an
opportunity
of
uniting
this
former
division
of
the
viceroyalty
of
new
granada
to
his
republic
of
colombia
bolivar
appointed
antonio
jose
de
sucre
his
ablest
lieutenant
and
probably
the
most
efficient
of
all
spanish
american
soldiers
of
the
time
to
assume
charge
of
the
campaign
on
his
arrival
at
guayaquil
this
officer
found
the
inhabitants
at
odds
among
themselves
some
hearkening
to
the
pleas
of
an
agent
of
san
martin
favored
union
with
peru
others
yielding
to
the
arguments
of
a
representative
of
bolivar
urged
annexation
to
colombia
still
others
regarded
absolute
independence
as
most
desirable
under
these
circumstances
sucre
for
a
while
made
little
headway
against
the
royalists
concentrated
in
the
mountainous
parts
of
the
country
despite
the
partial
support
he
received
from
troops
which
were
sent
by
the
southern
commander
at
length
on
may
scaling
the
flanks
of
the
volcano
of
pichincha
near
the
capital
town
of
quito
itself
he
delivered
the
blow
for
freedom
here
bolivar
who
had
fought
his
way
overland
amid
tremendous
difficulties
joined
him
and
started
for
guayaquil
where
he
and
san
martin
were
to
hold
their
memorable
interview
no
characters
in
spanish
american
history
have
called
forth
so
much
controversy
about
their
respective
merits
and
demerits
as
these
two
heroes
of
independence
bolivar
and
san
martin
even
now
it
seems
quite
impossible
to
obtain
from
the
admirers
of
either
an
opinion
that
does
full
justice
to
both
and
foreigners
who
venture
to
pass
judgment
are
almost
certain
to
provoke
criticism
from
one
set
of
partisans
or
the
other
both
bolivar
and
san
martin
were
sons
of
country
gentlemen
aristocratic
by
lineage
and
devoted
to
the
cause
of
independence
bolivar
was
alert
dauntless
brilliant
impetuous
vehemently
patriotic
and
yet
often
capricious
domineering
vain
ostentatious
and
disdainful
of
moral
considerations
a
masterful
man
fertile
in
intellect
fluent
in
speech
and
with
pen
an
inspiring
leader
and
one
born
to
command
in
state
and
army
quite
as
earnest
equally
courageous
and
upholding
in
private
life
a
higher
standard
of
morals
san
martin
was
relatively
calm
cautious
almost
taciturn
in
manner
and
slower
in
thought
and
action
he
was
primarily
a
soldier
fitted
to
organize
and
conduct
expeditions
rather
than
a
man
endowed
with
that
supreme
confidence
in
himself
which
brings
enthusiasm
affection
and
loyalty
in
its
train
when
san
martin
arrived
at
guayaquil
late
in
july
his
hope
of
annexing
the
province
of
quito
to
peru
was
rudely
shattered
by
the
news
that
bolivar
had
already
declared
it
a
part
of
colombia
though
it
was
outwardly
cordial
and
even
effusive
the
meeting
of
the
two
men
held
out
no
prospect
of
accord
in
an
interchange
of
views
which
lasted
but
a
few
hours
mutual
suspicion
jealousy
and
resentment
prevented
their
reaching
an
effective
understanding
the
protector
it
would
seem
thought
the
liberator
actuated
by
a
boundless
ambition
that
would
not
endure
resistance
bolivar
fancied
san
martin
a
crafty
schemer
plotting
for
his
own
advancement
they
failed
to
agree
on
the
three
fundamental
points
essential
to
their
further
cooperation
bolivar
declined
to
give
up
the
province
of
quito
he
refused
also
to
send
an
army
into
peru
unless
he
could
command
it
in
person
and
then
he
declined
to
undertake
the
expedition
on
the
ground
that
as
president
of
colombia
he
ought
not
to
leave
the
territory
of
the
republic
divining
this
pretext
san
martin
offered
to
serve
under
his
orders
a
feint
that
bolivar
parried
by
protesting
that
he
would
not
hear
of
any
such
on
the
part
of
a
brother
officer
above
all
the
two
men
differed
about
the
political
form
to
be
adopted
for
the
new
independent
states
both
of
them
realized
that
anything
like
genuine
democracies
was
quite
impossible
of
attainment
for
many
years
to
come
and
that
strong
administrations
would
be
needful
to
tide
the
spanish
americans
over
from
the
political
inexperience
of
colonial
days
and
the
disorders
of
revolution
to
intelligent
which
could
come
only
after
a
practical
acquaintance
with
public
concerns
on
a
large
scale
san
martin
believed
that
a
limited
monarchy
was
the
best
form
of
government
under
the
circumstances
bolivar
held
fast
to
the
idea
of
a
centralized
or
unitary
republic
in
which
actual
power
should
be
exercised
by
a
life
president
and
an
hereditary
senate
until
the
people
represented
in
a
lower
house
should
have
gained
a
sufficient
amount
of
political
experience
when
san
martin
returned
to
lima
he
found
affairs
in
a
worse
state
than
ever
the
tyrannical
conduct
of
the
officer
he
had
left
in
charge
had
provoked
an
uprising
that
made
his
position
insupportable
conscious
that
his
mission
had
come
to
an
end
and
certain
that
unless
he
gave
way
a
collision
with
bolivar
was
inevitable
san
martin
resolved
to
sacrifice
himself
lest
harm
befall
the
common
cause
in
which
both
had
done
such
yeoman
service
accordingly
he
resigned
his
power
into
the
hands
of
a
constituent
congress
and
left
the
country
but
when
he
found
that
no
happier
fortune
awaited
him
in
chile
and
in
his
own
native
land
san
martin
decided
to
abandon
spanish
america
forever
and
go
into
selfimposed
exile
broken
in
health
and
spirit
he
took
up
his
residence
in
france
a
recipient
of
bounty
from
a
spaniard
who
had
once
been
his
comrade
in
arms
meanwhile
in
the
mexican
part
of
the
viceroyalty
of
new
spain
the
cry
of
independence
raised
by
morelos
and
his
bands
of
indian
followers
had
been
stifled
by
the
capture
and
execution
of
the
leader
but
the
cause
of
independence
was
not
dead
even
if
its
achievement
was
to
be
entrusted
to
other
hands
eager
to
emulate
the
example
of
their
brethren
in
south
america
small
parties
of
spaniards
and
creoles
fought
to
overturn
the
despotic
rule
of
ferdinand
vii
only
to
encounter
defeat
from
the
royalists
then
came
the
revolution
of
in
the
mother
country
forthwith
demands
were
heard
for
a
recognition
of
the
liberal
regime
fearful
of
being
displaced
from
power
the
viceroy
with
the
support
of
the
clergy
and
aristocracy
ordered
agustin
de
iturbide
a
creole
officer
who
had
been
an
active
royalist
to
quell
an
insurrection
in
the
southern
part
of
the
country
the
choice
of
this
soldier
was
unfortunate
personally
ambitious
and
cherishing
in
secret
the
thought
of
independence
iturbide
faithless
to
his
trust
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
insurgents
which
culminated
february
in
what
was
called
the
plan
of
iguala
it
contained
three
main
provisions
or
guarantees
as
they
were
termed
the
maintenance
of
the
catholic
religion
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
the
establishment
of
a
constitutional
monarchy
separate
from
spain
and
ruled
by
ferdinand
himself
or
if
he
declined
the
honor
by
some
other
european
prince
and
the
union
of
mexicans
and
spaniards
without
distinction
of
caste
or
privilege
a
temporary
government
also
in
the
form
of
a
junta
presided
over
by
the
viceroy
was
to
be
created
and
provision
was
made
for
the
organization
of
an
army
of
the
three
guarantees
despite
opposition
from
the
royalists
the
plan
won
increasing
favor
powerless
to
thwart
it
and
inclined
besides
to
a
policy
of
conciliation
the
new
viceroy
juan
agreed
to
ratify
it
on
condition
in
obedience
to
a
suggestion
from
iturbide
that
the
parties
concerned
should
be
at
liberty
if
they
desired
to
choose
any
one
as
emperor
whether
he
were
of
a
reigning
family
or
not
thereupon
on
the
of
september
the
provisional
government
installed
at
the
city
of
mexico
announced
the
consummation
of
an
enterprise
rendered
eternally
memorable
which
a
genius
beyond
all
admiration
and
eulogy
love
and
glory
of
his
country
began
at
iguala
prosecuted
and
carried
into
effect
overcoming
obstacles
almost
insuparable
and
declared
the
independence
of
a
mexican
empire
the
act
was
followed
by
the
appointment
of
a
regency
to
govern
until
the
accession
of
ferdinand
vii
or
some
other
personage
to
the
imperial
throne
of
this
body
iturbide
assumed
the
presidency
which
carried
with
it
the
powers
of
commander
in
chief
and
a
salary
of
pesos
paid
from
the
day
on
which
the
plan
of
iguala
was
signed
contented
himself
with
membership
on
the
board
and
a
salary
of
that
amount
until
his
speedy
demise
removed
from
the
scene
the
last
of
the
spanish
viceroys
in
north
america
one
step
more
was
needed
learning
that
the
cortes
in
spain
had
rejected
the
entire
scheme
iturbide
allowed
his
soldiers
to
acclaim
him
emperor
and
an
unwilling
congress
saw
itself
obliged
to
ratify
the
choice
on
july
the
destinies
of
the
country
were
committed
to
the
charge
of
agustin
the
first
as
in
the
area
of
mexico
proper
so
in
the
central
american
part
of
the
viceroyalty
of
new
spain
the
spanish
revolution
of
had
unexpected
results
here
in
the
five
little
provinces
composing
the
captaincy
general
of
guatemala
there
was
much
unrest
but
nothing
of
a
serious
nature
occurred
until
after
news
had
been
brought
of
the
plan
of
iguala
and
its
immediate
outcome
thereupon
a
popular
assembly
met
at
the
capital
town
of
guatemala
and
on
september
declared
the
country
an
independent
state
this
radical
act
accomplished
the
patriot
leaders
were
unable
to
proceed
further
demands
for
the
establishment
of
a
federation
for
a
recognition
of
local
autonomy
for
annexation
to
mexico
were
all
heard
and
none
except
the
last
was
answered
while
the
imperialists
and
republicans
were
arguing
it
out
a
message
from
emperor
agustin
announced
that
he
would
not
allow
the
new
state
to
remain
independent
on
submission
of
the
matter
to
a
vote
of
the
cabildos
most
of
them

led
off
in
recognizing
the

of

in

the

santo
domingo
followed
the
lead
of
its
sister
colonies
on
the
mainland
by
asserting
in
its
independence
but
its
brief
independent
life
was
snuffed
out
by
the
negroes
of
haiti
once
more
a
republic
who
spread
their
control
over
the
entire
island
cuba
also
felt
the
impulse
of
the
times
but
apart
from
the
agitation
of
secret
societies
like
the
rays
and
suns
of
bolivar
which
was
soon
checked
the
colony
remained
tranquil
in
portuguese
america
the
knowledge
of
what
had
occurred
throughout
the
spanish
dominions
could
not
fail
to
awaken
a
desire
for
independence
the
prince
regent
was
well
aware
of
the
discontent
of
the
brazilians
but
he
thought
to
allay
it
by
substantial
concessions
in
he
proceeded
to
elevate
the
colony
to
substantial
equality
with
the
mother
country
by
joining
them
under
the
title
of
united
kingdom
of
portugal
brazil
and
the
algarves
the
next
year
the
prince
regent
himself
became
king
under
the
name
of
john
iv
the
flame
of
discontent
nevertheless
continued
to
smolder
republican
outbreaks
though
quelled
without
much
difficulty
recurred
even
the
reforms
which
had
been
instituted
by
john
himself
while
regent
and
which
had
assured
freer
communication
with
the
world
at
large
only
emphasized
more
and
more
the
absurdity
of
permitting
a
feeble
little
land
like
portugal
to
retain
its
hold
upon
a
region
so
extensive
and
valuable
as
brazil
the
events
of
in
portugal
hastened
the
movement
toward
independence
fired
by
the
success
of
their
spanish
comrades
the
portuguese
liberals
forthwith
rose
in
revolt
demanded
the
establishment
of
a
limited
monarchy
and
insisted
that
the
king
return
to
his
people
in
similar
fashion
also
they
drew
up
a
constitution
which
provided
for
the
representation
of
brazil
by
deputies
in
a
future
cortes
beyond
this
they
would
concede
no
special
privileges
to
the
colony
indeed
their
idea
seems
to
have
been
that
with
the
king
once
more
in
lisbon
their
own
liberties
would
be
secure
and
those
of
brazil
would
be
reduced
to
what
were
befitting
a
mere
dependency
yielding
to
the
inevitable
the
king
decided
to
return
to
portugal
leaving
the
young
crown
prince
to
act
as
regent
in
the
colony
a
critical
moment
for
the
little
country
and
its
big
dominion
oversea
had
indubitably
arrived
john
understood
the
trend
of
the
times
for
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
he
said
to
his
son
pedro
if
brazil
is
to
separate
itself
from
portugal
as
seems
likely
you
take
the
crown
yourself
before
any
one
else
gets
it
pedro
was
liberal
in
sentiment
popular
among
the
brazilians
and
toward
the
aspirations
of
the
country
for
a
larger
measure
of
freedom
and
yet
not
blind
to
the
interests
of
the
dynasty
of
braganza
he
readily
listened
to
the
urgent
pleas
of
the
leaders
of
the
separatist
party
against
obeying
the
repressive
mandaes
of
the
cortes
laws
which
abolished
the
central
government
of
the
colony
and
made
the
various
provinces
individually
subject
to
portugal
he
declined
to
notice
with
equal
promptness
he
refused
to
heed
an
order
bidding
him
return
to
portugal
immediately
to
a
delegation
of
prominent
brazilians
he
said
emphatically
for
the
good
of
all
and
the
general
welfare
of
the
nation
i
shall
stay
more
than
that
in
may
he
accepted
from
the
municipality
of
rio
de
janeiro
the
title
of
perpetual
and
constitutional
defender
of
brazil
and
in
a
series
of
proclamations
urged
the
people
of
the
country
to
begin
the
great
work
of
emancipation
by
forcibly
resisting
if
needful
any
attempt
at
coercion
pedro
now
believed
the
moment
had
come
to
take
the
final
step
while
on
a
journey
through
the
province
of
sao
paulo
he
was
overtaken
on
the
of
september
near
a
little
stream
called
the
ypiranga
by
messengers
with
dispatches
from
portugal
finding
that
the
cortes
had
annulled
his
acts
and
declared
his
ministers
guilty
of
treason
pedro
forthwith
proclaimed
brazil
an
independent
state
the
cry
of
ypiranga
was
echoed
with
tremendous
enthusiasm
throughout
the
country
when
pedro
appeared
in
the
theater
at
rio
de
janeiro
a
few
days
later
wearing
on
his
arm
a
ribbon
on
which
were
inscribed
the
words
independence
or
death
he
was
given
a
tumultuous
ovation
on
the
first
day
of
december
the
youthful
monarch
assumed
the
title
of
emperor
and
brazil
thereupon
took
its
place

tucuman
took
the
decisive
action
that
severed
the
bond
with
spain
it
uttered
a
prophecy
for
all
spanish
america
to
quote
its
language
vast
and
fertile
regions
climates
benign
and
varied
abundant
means
of
subsistence
treasures
of
gold
and
silver
and
fine
productions
of
every
sort
will
attract
to
our
continent
innumerable
thousands
of
immigrants
to
whom
we
shall
open
a
safe
place
of
refuge
and
extend
a
beneficent
protection
more
hopeful
still
were
the
words
of
a
spokesman
for
another
independent
country
united
neither
the
empire
of
the
assyrians
the
medes
or
the
persians
the
macedonian
or
the
roman
empire
can
ever
be
compared
with
this
colossal
republic
very
different
was
the
vision
of
bolivar
while
a
refugee
in
jamaica
he
wrote
we
are
a
little
human
species
we
possess
a
world
apart
new
in
almost
all
the
arts
and
sciences
and
yet
old
after
a
fashion
in
the
uses
of
civil
society
neither
indians
nor
europeans
we
are
a
species
that
lies
midway
is
it
conceivable
that
a
people
recently
freed
of
its
chains
can
launch
itself
into
the
sphere
of
liberty
without
shattering
its
wings
like
icarus
and
plunging
into
the
abyss
such
a
prodigy
is
inconceivable
never
beheld
toward
the
close
of
his
career
he
declared
the
majority
are
mestizos
mulattoes
indians
and
negroes
an
ignorant
people
is
a
blunt
instrument
for
its
own
destruction
to
it
liberty
means
license
patriotism
means
disloyalty
and
justice
means
vengeance
independence
he
exclaimed
is
the
only
good
we
have
achieved
at
the
cost
of
everything
else
whether
the
abounding
confidence
of
the
prophecy
or
the
anxious
doubt
of
the
vision
would
come
true
only
the
future
could
tell
in
at
all
events
optimism
was
the
watchword
and
the
total
exclusion
of
spain
from
south
america
the
goal
of
bolivar
and
his
lieutenants
as
they
started
southward
to
complete
the
work
of
emancipation
which
had
been
begun
by
san
martin
the
patriots
of
peru
indeed
had
fallen
into
straits
so
desperate
that
an
appeal
to
the
liberator
offered
the
only
hope
of
salvation
while
the
royalists
under
their
able
and
vigilant
leader
jose
canterac
continued
to
strengthen
their
grasp
upon
the
interior
of
the
country
and
to
uphold
the
power
of
the
viceroy
the
president
chosen
by
the
congress
had
been
driven
by
the
enemy
from
lima
a
number
of
the
legislators
in
wrath
thereupon
declared
the
president
deposed
not
to
be
outdone
that
functionary
on
his
part
declared
the
congress
dissolved
the
malcontents
immediately
proceeded
to
elect
a
new
chief
magistrate
thus
bringing
two
presidents
into
the
field
and
inaugurating
a
spectacle
destined
to
become
all
too
common
in
the
subsequent
annals
of
spanish
america
when
bolivar
arrived
at
callao
the
seaport
of
lima
in
september
he
acted
with
prompt
vigor
he
expelled
one
president
converted
the
other
into
a
passive
instrument
of
his
will
declined
to
promulgate
a
constitution
that
the
congress
had
prepared
and
after
obtaining
from
that
body
an
appointment
to
supreme
command
dissolved
the
congress
without
further
ado
unfortunately
none
of
these
radical
measures
had
any
perceptible
effect
upon
the
military
situation
though
bolivar
gathered
together
an
army
made
up
of
colombians
peruvians
and
remnants
of
san
martin
force
many
months
elapsed
before
he
could
venture
upon
a
serious
campaign
then
events
in
spain
played
into
his
hands
the
reaction
that
had
followed
the
restoration
of
ferdinand
vii
to
absolute
power
crossed
the
ocean
and
split
the
royalists
into
opposing
factions
quick
to
seize
the
chance
thus
afforded
bolivar
marched
over
the
andes
to
the
plain
of
junin
there
on
august
he
repelled
an
onslaught
by
canterac
and
drove
that
leader
back
in
headlong
flight
believing
however
that
the
position
he
held
was
too
perilous
to
risk
an
offensive
he
entrusted
the
military
command
to
sucre
and
returned
to
headquarters
the
royalists
had
now
come
to
realize
that
only
a
supreme
effort
could
save
them
they
must
overwhelm
sucre
before
reinforcements
could
reach
him
and
to
this
end
an
army
of
upwards
of
ten
thousand
was
assembled
on
the
of
december
it
encountered
sucre
and
his
six
thousand
soldiers
in
the
valley
of
ayacucho
or
corner
of
death
where
the
patriot
general
had
entrenched
his
army
with
admirable
skill
the
result
was
a
total
defeat
for
the
royalists
the
waterloo
of
spain
in
south
america
the
battle
thus
won
by
ragged
and
hungry
soldiers
whose
countersign
the
night
before
had
been
bread
and
cheese
threw
off
the
yoke
of
the
mother
country
forever
the
viceroy
fell
wounded
into
their
hands
and
canterac
surrendered
on
receipt
of
the
glorious
news
the
people
of
lima
greeted
bolivar
with
wild
enthusiasm
a
congress
prolonged
his
dictatorship
amid
adulations
that
bordered
on
the
grotesque
eastward
of
peru
in
the
vast
mountainous
region
of
charcas
on
the
very
heights
of
south
america
the
royalists
still
found
a
refuge
in
january
a
patriot
general
at
the
town
of
la
paz
undertook
on
his
own
responsibility
to
declare
the
entire
province
independent
alike
of
spain
peru
and
the
united
provinces
of
la
plata
this
action
was
too
precipitous
not
to
say
presumptuous
to
suit
bolivar
and
sucre
the
better
to
control
the
situation
the
former
went
up
to
la
paz
and
the
latter
to
chuquisaca
the
capital
where
a
congress
was
to
assemble
for
the
purpose
of
imparting
a
more
orderly
turn
to
affairs
under
the
direction
of
the
marshal
of
ayacucho
as
sucre
was
now
called
the
congress
issued
on
the
of
august
a
formal
declaration
of
independence
in
honor
of
the
liberator
it
christened
the
new
republic
bolivar
later
latinized
into
bolivia
and
conferred
upon
him
the
presidency
so
long
as
he
might
choose
to
remain
in
november
a
new
congress
which
had
been
summoned
to
draft
a
constitution
accepted
with
slight
modifications
an
instrument
that
the
liberator
himself
had
prepared
that
body
also
renamed
the
capital
sucre
and
chose
the
hero
of
ayacucho
as
president
of
the
republic
now
the
liberator
thought
was
the
opportune
moment
to
impose
upon
his
territorial
namesake
a
constitution
embodying
his
ideas
of
a
stable
government
which
would
give
spanish
americans
eventually
the
political
experience
they
needed
providing
for
an
autocracy
represented
by
a
life
president
it
ran
the
gamut
of
aristocracy
and
democracy
all
the
way
from
censors
for
life
who
were
to
watch
over
the
due
enforcement
of
the
laws
down
to
senators
and
tribunes
chosen
by
electors
who
in
turn
were
to
be
named
by
a
select
citizenry
whenever
actually
present
in
the
territory
of
the
republic
the
liberator
was
to
enjoy
supreme
command
in
case
he
wished
to
exercise
it
in
simon
bolivar
stood
at
the
zenith
of
his
glory
and
power
no
adherents
of
the
spanish
regime
were
left
in
south
america
to
menace
the
freedom
of
its
independent
states
in
january
a
resistance
kept
up
for
nine
years
by
a
handful
of
royalists
lodged
on
the
remote
island
of
chiloe
off
the
southern
coast
of
chile
had
been
broken
and
the
garrison
at
the
fortress
of
callao
had
laid
down
its
arms
after
a
valiant
struggle
among
spanish
americans
no
one
was
comparable
to
the
marvelous
man
who
had
founded
three
great
republics
stretching
from
the
caribbean
sea
to
the
tropic
of
capricorn
hailed
as
the
liberator
and
the
terror
of
despots
he
was
also
acclaimed
by
the
people
as
the
redeemer
the
son
of
the
new
world
national
destinies
were
committed
to
his
charge
and
equestrian
statues
were
erected
in
his
honor
in
the
popular
imagination
he
was
ranked
with
napoleon
as
a
peerless
conqueror
and
with
washington
as
the
father
of
his
country
that
megalomania
should
have
seized
the
mind
of
the
liberator
under
circumstances
like
these
is
not
strange
ever
a
zealous
advocate
of
large
states
bolivar
was
an
equally
ardent
partisan
of
confederation
as
president
of
three
republics
of
colombia
actually
and
of
its
satellites
peru
and
bolivia
through
his
lieutenants
he
could
afford
now
to
carry
out
the
plan
that
he
had
long
since
cherished
of
assembling
at
the
town
of
panama
on
colombian
soil
an
august
congress
representative
of
the
independent
countries
of
america
here
on
the
isthmus
created
by
nature
to
join
the
continents
the
nations
created
by
men
should
foregather
and
proclaim
fraternal
accord
presenting
to
the
autocratic
governments
of
europe
a
solid
front
of
resistance
to
their
pretensions
as
well
as
a
visible
symbol
of
unity
in
sentiment
such
a
congress
by
meeting
periodically
would
also
promote
friendship
among
the
republics
of
the
western
hemisphere
and
supply
a
convenient
means
of
settling
their
disputes
at
this
time
the
united
states
was
regarded
by
its
sister
republics
with
all
the
affection
which
gratitude
for
services
rendered
to
the
cause
of
emancipation
could
evoke
was
it
not
itself
a
republic
its
people
a
democracy
its
development
astounding
and
its
future
radiant
with
hope
the
pronouncement
of
president
monroe
in
protesting
against
interference
on
the
part
of
european
powers
with
the
liberties
of
independent
america
afforded
the
clearest
possible
proof
that
the
great
northern
republic
was
a
natural
protector
guide
and
friend
whose
advice
and
cooperation
ought
to
be
invoked
the
united
states
was
accordingly
asked
to
take
part
in
the
assembly
not
to
concert
military
measures
but
simply
to
join
its
fellows
to
the
southward
in
a
solemn
proclamation
of
the
monroe
doctrine
by
america
at
large
and
to
discuss
means
of
suppressing
the
slave
trade
the
congress
that
met
at
panama
in
june
afforded
scant
encouragement
to
bolivar
roseate
hope
of
interamerican
solidarity
whether
because
of
the
difficulties
of
travel
or
because
of
internal
dissensions
or
because
of
the
suspicion
that
the
megalomania
of
the
liberator
had
awakened
in
spanish
america
only
the
four
continental
countries
nearest
the
isthmus
mexico
central
america
colombia
and
peru
were
represented
the
delegates
nevertheless
signed
a
compact
of
perpetual
union
league
and
confederation
provided
for
mutual
assistance
to
be
rendered
by
the
several
nations
in
time
of
war
and
arranged
to
have
the
areopagus
of
the
americas
transferred
to
mexico
none
of
the
acts
of
this
congress
was
ratified
by
the
republics
concerned
except
the
agreement
for
union
which
was
adopted
by
colombia
disheartening
to
bolivar
as
this
spectacle
was
it
proved
merely
the
first
of
a
series
of
calamities
which
were
to
overshadow
the
later
years
of
the
liberator
his
grandiose
political
structure
began
to
crumble
for
it
was
built
on
the
shifting
sands
of
a
fickle
popularity
the
more
he
urged
a
general
acceptance
of
the
principles
of
his
autocratic
constitution
the
surer
were
his
followers
that
he
coveted
royal
honors
in
december
he
imposed
his
instrument
upon
peru
then
he
learned
that
a
meeting
in
venezuela
presided
over
by
paez
had
declared
itself
in
favor
of
separation
from
colombia
hardly
had
he
left
peru
to
check
this
movement
when
an
uprising
at
lima
deposed
his
representative
and
led
to
the
summons
of
a
congress
which
in
june
restored
the
former
constitution
and
chose
a
new
president
in
quito
also
the
government
of
the
unstable
dictator
was
overthrown
alarmed
by
symptoms
of
disaffection
which
also
appeared
in
the
western
part
of
the
republic
bolivar
hurried
to
bogota
there
in
the
hope
of
removing
the
growing
antagonism
he
offered
his
irrevocable
resignation
as
he
had
done
on
more
than
one
occasion
before
though
the
malcontents
declined
to
accept
his
withdrawal
from
office
they
insisted
upon
his
calling
a
constitutional
convention
meeting
at
ocana
in
april
that
body
proceeded
to
abolish
the
life
tenure
of
the
presidency
to
limit
the
powers
of
the
executive
and
to
increase
those
of
the
legislature
bolivar
managed
to
quell
the
opposition
in
dictatorial
fashion
but
his
prestige
had
by
this
time
fallen
so
low
that
an
attempt
was
made
to
assassinate
him
the
severity
with
which
he
punished
the
conspirators
served
only
to
diminish
still
more
the
popular
confidence
which
he
had
once
enjoyed
even
in
bolivia
his
star
of
destiny
had
set
an
outbreak
of
colombian
troops
at
the
capital
forced
the
faithful
sucre
to
resign
and
leave
the
country
the
constitution
was
then
modified
to
meet
the
demand
for
a
less
autocratic
government
and
a
new
chief
magistrate
was
installed
desperately
the
liberator
strove
to
ward
off
the
impending
collapse
though
he
recovered
possession
of
the
division
of
quito
a
year
of
warfare
failed
to
win
back
peru
and
he
was
compelled
to
renounce
all
pretense
of
governing
it
feeble
in
body
and
distracted
in
mind
he
condemned
bitterly
the
machinations
of
his
enemies
there
is
no
good
faith
in
colombia
he
exclaimed
neither
among
men
nor
among
nations
treaties
are
paper
constitutions
books
elections
combats
liberty
anarchy
and
life
itself
a
torment
but
the
hardest
blow
was
yet
to
fall
late
in
december
an
assembly
at
caracas
declared
venezuela
a
separate
state
the
great
republic
was
rent
in
twain
and
even
what
was
left
soon
split
apart
in
may
came
the
final
crash
the
congress
at
bogota
drafted
a
constitution
providing
for
a
separate
republic
to
bear
the
old
spanish
name
of
new
granada
accepted
definitely
the
resignation
of
bolivar
and
granted
him
a
pension
venezuela
his
native
land
set
up
a
congress
of
its
own
and
demanded
that
he
be
exiled
the
division
of
quito
declared
itself
independent
under
the
name
of
the
republic
of
the
equator
ecuador
everywhere
the
artificial
handiwork
of
the
liberator
lay
in
ruins
america
is
ungovernable
those
who
have
served
in
the
revolution
have
ploughed
the
sea
was
his
despairing
cry
stricken
to
death
the
fallen
hero
retired
to
an
estate
near
santa
marta
here
like
his
famous
rival
san
martin
in
france
he
found
hospitality
at
the
hands
of
a
spaniard
on
december
the
liberator
gave
up
his
troubled
soul
while
bolivar
great
republic
was
falling
apart
the
united
provinces
of
la
plata
had
lost
practically
all
semblance
of
cohesion
so
broad
were
their
notions
of
liberty
that
the
several
provinces
maintained
a
substantial
independence
of
one
another
while
within
each
province
the
caudillos
or
partisan
chieftains
fought
among
themselves
buenos
aires
alone
managed
to
preserve
a
measure
of
stability
this
comparative
peace
was
due
to
the
financial
and
commercial
measures
devised
by
bernardino
rivadavia
one
of
the
most
capable
statesmen
of
the
time
and
to
the
energetic
manner
in
which
disorder
was
suppressed
by
juan
manuel
de
rosas
commander
of
the
gaucho
or
cowboy
militia
thanks
also
to
the
former
leader
the
provinces
were
induced
in
to
join
in
framing
a
constitution
of
a
unitary
character
which
vested
in
the
administration
at
buenos
aires
the
power
of
appointing
the
local
governors
and
of
controlling
foreign
affairs
the
name
of
the
country
was
at
the
same
time
changed
to
that
of
the
argentine
confederation
c
latin
rendering
of
la
plata
no
sooner
had
rivadavia
assumed
the
presidency
under
the
new
order
of
things
than
dissension
at
home
and
warfare
abroad
threatened
to
destroy
all
that
he
had
accomplished
ignoring
the
terms
of
the
constitution
the
provinces
had
already
begun
to
reject
the
supremacy
of
buenos
aires
when
the
outbreak
of
a
struggle
with
brazil
forced
the
contending
parties
for
a
while
to
unite
in
the
face
of
the
common
enemy
as
before
the
object
of
international
dispute
was
the
region
of
the
banda
oriental
the
rule
of
brazil
had
not
been
oppressive
but
the
people
of
its
cisplatine
province
attached
by
language
and
sympathy
to
their
western
neighbors
longed
nevertheless
to
be
free
of
foreign
control
in
april
a
band
of
refugees
arrived
from
buenos
aires
and
started
a
revolution
which
spread
throughout
the
country
organizing
a
provisional
government
the
insurgents
proclaimed
independence
of
brazil
and
incorporation
with
the
united
provinces
of
la
plata
as
soon
as
the
authorities
at
buenos
aires
had
approved
this
action
war
was
inevitable
though
the
brazilians
were
decisively
beaten
at
the
battle
of
ituzaingo
on
february
the
struggle
lasted
until
august
when
mediation
by
great
britain
led
to
the
conclusion
of
a
treaty
at
rio
de
janeiro
by
which
both
brazil
and
the
argentine
confederation
recognized
the
absolute
independence
of
the
disputed
province
as
the
republic
of
uruguay
instead
of
quieting
the
discord
that
prevailed
among
the
argentinos
these
victories
only
fomented
trouble
the
federalists
had
ousted
rivadavia
and
discarded
the
constitution
but
the
federal
idea
for
which
they
stood
had
several
meanings
to
an
inhabitant
of
buenos
aires
federalism
meant
domination
by
the
capital
not
only
over
the
province
of
the
same
name
but
over
the
other
provinces
whereas
to
the
people
of
the
provinces
and
even
to
many
of
federalist
faith
in
the
province
of
buenos
aires
itself
the
term
stood
for
the
idea
of
a
loose
confederation
in
which
each
provincial
governor
or
chieftain
should
be
practically
supreme
in
his
own
district
so
long
as
he
could
maintain
himself
the
unitaries
were
opponents
of
both
except
in
so
far
as
their
insistence
upon
a
centralized
form
of
government
for
the
nation
would
necessarily
lead
to
the
location
of
that
government
at
buenos
aires
this
peculiar
dual
contest
between
the
town
and
the
province
of
buenos
aires
and
of
the
other
provinces
against
either
or
both
persisted
for
the
next
sixty
years
in
however
a
prolonged
lull
set
in
when
rosas
the
gaucho
leader
having
won
in
company
with
other
caudillos
a
decisive
triumph
over
the
unitaries
entered
the
capital
and
took
supreme
command
in
chile
the
course
of
events
had
assumed
quite
a
different
aspect
here
in
a
species
of
constitution
had
been
adopted
by
popular
vote
in
a
manner
that
appeared
to
show
remarkable
unanimity
for
the
books
in
which
the
ayes
and
noes
were
to
be
recorded
contained
no
entries
in
the
negative
what
the
records
really
prove
is
that
the
supreme
director
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
the
ruling
class
in
exercise
of
the
autocratic
power
entrusted
to
him
he
now
proceeded
to
introduce
a
variety
of
administrative
reforms
of
signal
advantage
to
the
moral
and
material
welfare
of
the
country
but
as
the
danger
of
conquest
from
any
quarter
lessened
the
demand
for
a
more
democratic
organization
grew
louder
until
in
it
became
so
persistent
that
called
a
convention
to
draft
a
new
fundamental
law
but
its
provisions
suited
neither
himself
nor
his
opponents
thereupon
realizing
that
his
views
of
the
political
capacity
of
the
people
resembled
those
of
bolivar
and
were
no
longer
applicable
and
that
his
reforms
had
aroused
too
much
hostility
the
supreme
director
resigned
his
post
and
retired
to
peru
thus
another
hero
of
emancipation
had
met
the
ingratitude
for
which
republics
are
notorious
political
convulsions
in
the
country
followed
the
abdication
of
not
only
had
the
spirit
of
the
strife
between
unitaries
and
federalists
been
communicated
to
chile
from
the
neighboring
republic
to
the
eastward
but
two
other
parties
or
factions
divided
on
still
different
lines
had
arisen
these
were
the
conservative
and
the
liberal
or
bigwigs
pelucones
and
greenhorns
pipiolos
as
the
adherents
of
the
one
derisively
dubbed
the
partisans
of
the
other
although
in
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
struggle
two
constitutions
were
adopted
neither
sufficed
to
quiet
the
agitation
not
until
when
the
liberals
sustained
an
utter
defeat
on
the
field
of
battle
did
the
country
enter
upon
a
period
of
quiet
progress
along
conservative
lines
from
that
time
onward
it
presented
a
surprising
contrast
to
its
fellow
republics
which
were
beset
with
afflictions
far
to
the
northward
the
empire
of
mexico
set
up
by
iturbide
in
was
doomed
to
a
speedy
fall
emperor
by
divine
providence
that
ambitious
adventurer
inscribed
on
his
coins
but
his
countrymen
knew
that
the
bayonets
of
his
soldiers
were
the
actual
mainstay
of
his
pretentious
title
neither
his
earlier
career
nor
the
size
of
his
following
was
sufficiently
impressive
to
assure
him
popular
support
if
the
military
prop
gave
way
his
lavish
expenditures
furthermore
and
his
arbitrary
replacement
of
the
congress
by
a
docile
body
which
would
authorize
forced
loans
at
his
command
steadily
undermined
his
position
apart
from
the
faults
of
iturbide
himself
the
popular
sentiment
of
a
country
bordering
immediately
upon
the
united
states
could
not
fail
to
be
colored
by
the
ideas
and
institutions
of
its
great
neighbor
so
too
the
example
of
what
had
been
accomplished
in
form
at
least
by
their
kinsmen
elsewhere
in
america
was
bound
to
wield
a
potent
influence
on
the
minds
of
the
mexicans
as
a
result
their
desire
for
a
republic
grew
stronger
from
day
to
day
iturbide
in
fact
had
not
enjoyed
his
exalted
rank
five
months
when
antonio
lopez
de
santa
anna
a
young
officer
destined
later
to
become
a
conspicuous
figure
in
mexican
history
started
a
revolt
to
replace
the
empire
by
a
republic
though
he
failed
in
his
object
two
of
iturbide
generals
joined
the
insurgents
in
demanding
a
restoration
of
the
congress
an
act
which
as
the
hapless
emperor
perceived
would
amount
to
his
dethronement
realizing
his
impotence
iturbide
summoned
the
congress
and
announced
his
abdication
but
instead
of
recognizing
this
procedure
that
body
declared
his
accession
itself
null
and
void
it
agreed
however
to
grant
him
a
pension
if
he
would
leave
the
country
and
reside
in
italy
with
this
disposition
of
his
person
iturbide
complied
but
he
soon
wearied
of
exile
and
persuaded
himself
that
he
would
not
lack
supporters
if
he
tried
to
regain
his
former
control
in
mexico
this
venture
he
decided
to
make
in
complete
ignorance
of
a
decree
ordering
his
summary
execution
if
he
dared
to
set
foot
again
on
mexican
soil
he
had
hardly
landed
in
july
when
he
was
seized
and
shot
since
a
constituent
assembly
had
declared
itself
in
favor
of
establishing
a
federal
form
of
republic
patterned
after
that
of
the
united
states
the
promulgation
of
a
constitution
followed
on
october
and
guadalupe
victoria
one
of
the
leaders
in
the
revolt
against
iturbide
was
chosen
president
of
the
united
mexican
states
though
considerable
unrest
prevailed
toward
the
close
of
his
term
the
new
president
managed
to
retain
his
office
for
the
allotted
four
years
in
most
respects
however
the
new
order
of
things
opened
auspiciously
in
november
the
surrender
of
the
fortress
of
san
juan
de
ulua
in
the
harbor
of
vera
cruz
banished
the
last
remnant
of
spanish
power
and
two
years
later
the
suppression
of
plots
for
the
restoration
of
ferdinand
vii
coupled
with
the
expulsion
of
a
large
number
of
spaniards
helped
to
restore
calm
there
were
those
even
who
dared
to
hope
that
the
federal
system
would
operate
as
smoothly
in
mexico
as
it
had
done
in
the
united
states
but
the
political
organization
of
a
country
so
different
from
its
northern
neighbor
in
population
traditions
and
practices
could
not
rest
merely
on
a
basis
of
imitation
even
more
or
less
modified
the
artificiality
of
the
fabric
became
apparent
enough
as
soon
as
ambitious
individuals
and
groups
of
malcontents
concerted
measures
to
mold
it
into
a
likeness
of
reality
two
main
political
factions
soon
appeared
for
the
form
they
assumed
british
and
american
influences
were
responsible
adopting
a
kind
of
masonic
organization
the
conservatives
and
centralists
called
themselves
escoceses
men
whereas
the
radicals
and
federalists
took
the
name
of
yorkinos
men
whatever
their
respective
slogans
and
professions
of
political
faith
they
were
little
more
than
personal
followers
of
rival
generals
or
politicians
who
yearned
to
occupy
the
presidential
chair
upon
the
downfall
of
iturbide
the
malcontents
in
central
america
bestirred
themselves
to
throw
off
the
mexican
yoke
on
july
a
congress
declared
the
region
an
independent
republic
under
the
name
of
the
united
provinces
of
central
america
in
november
of
the
next
year
following
the
precedent
established
in
mexico
and
obedient
also
to
local
demand
the
new
republic
issued
a
constitution
in
accordance
with
which
the
five
little
divisions
of
guatemala
honduras
salvador
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
were
to
become
states
of
a
federal
union
each
having
the
privilege
of
choosing
its
own
local
authorities
immediately
federalists
and
centralists
radicals
and
conservatives
all
wished
it
would
seem
to
impose
their
particular
viewpoint
upon
their
fellows
the
situation
was
not
unlike
that
in
the
argentine
confederation
the
efforts
of
guatemala
the
province
in
which
power
had
been
concentrated
under
the
colonial
regime
to
assert
supremacy
over
its
fellow
states
and
their
refusal
to
respect
either
the
federal
bond
or
one
rights
made
civil
war
inevitable
the
struggle
which
broke
out
among
guatemala
salvador
and
honduras
lasted
until
when
francisco
morazan
at
the
head
of
the
allied
army
upholder
of
the
law
entered
the
capital
of
the
republic
and
assumed
dictatorial
power
of
all
the
hispanic
nations
however
brazil
was
easily
the
most
stable
here
the
leaders
while
clinging
to
independence
strove
to
avoid
dangerous
innovations
in
government
rather
than
create
a
political
system
for
which
the
country
was
not
prepared
they
established
a
constitutional
monarchy
but
brazil
itself
was
too
vast
and
its
interior
too
difficult
of
access
to
allow
it
to
become
all
at
once
a
unit
either
in
organization
or
in
spirit
the
idea
of
national
solidarity
had
as
yet
made
scant
progress
the
old
rivalry
which
existed
between
the
provinces
of
the
north
dominated
by
bahia
or
pernambuco
and
those
of
the
south
controlled
by
rio
de
janeiro
or
sao
paulo
still
made
itself
felt
what
the
empire
amounted
to
therefore
was
an
agglomeration
of
provinces
held
together
by
the
personal
prestige
of
a
young
monarch
since
the
mother
country
still
held
parts
of
northern
brazil
the
emperor
entrusted
the
energetic
cochrane
who
had
performed
such
valiant
service
for
chile
and
peru
with
the
task
of
expelling
the
foreign
soldiery
when
this
had
been
accomplished
and
a
republican
outbreak
in
the
same
region
had
been
suppressed
the
more
difficult
task
of
satisfying
all
parties
by
a
constitution
had
to
be
undertaken
there
were
partisans
of
monarchy
and
advocates
of
republicanism
men
of
conservative
and
of
liberal
sympathies
disagreements
also
between
the
brazilians
and
the
native
portuguese
residents
were
frequent
so
far
as
possible
pedro
desired
to
meet
popular
desires
and
yet
without
imposing
too
many
limitations
on
the
monarchy
itself
but
in
the
assembly
called
to
draft
the
constitution
the
liberal
members
made
a
determined
effort
to
introduce
republican
forms
pedro
thereupon
dissolved
that
body
and
in
promulgated
a
constitution
of
his
own
the
popularity
of
the
emperor
thereafter
soon
began
to
wane
partly
because
of
the
scandalous
character
of
his
private
life
and
partly
because
he
declined
to
observe
constitutional
restrictions
and
chose
his
ministers
at
will
his
insistent
war
in
portugal
to
uphold
the
claims
of
his
daughter
to
the
throne
betrayed
or
seemed
to
betray
dynastic
ambitions
his
inability
to
hold
uruguay
as
a
brazilian
province
and
his
continued
retention
of
foreign
soldiers
who
had
been
employed
in
the
struggle
with
the
argentine
confederation
for
the
apparent
purpose
of
quelling
possible
insurrections
in
the
future
bred
much
discontent
so
also
did
the
restraints
he
laid
upon
the
press
which
had
been
infected
by
the
liberal
movements
in
neighboring
republics
when
he
failed
to
subdue
these
outbreaks
his
rule
became
all
the
more
discredited
thereupon
menaced
by
a
dangerous
uprising
at
rio
de
janeiro
in
he
abdicated
the
throne
in
favor
of
his
son
pedro
then
five
years
of
age
and
set
sail
for
portugal
under
the
influence
of
great
britain
the
small
european
mother
country
had
in
recognized
the
independence
of
its
big
transatlantic
dominion
but
it
was
not
until
that
the
cortes
of
spain
authorized
the
crown
to
enter
upon
negotiations
looking
to
the
same
action
in
regard
to
the
eleven
republics
which
had
sprung
out
of
its
colonial
domain
even
then
many
years
elapsed
before
the
mother
country
acknowledged
the
independence
of
them
all
chapter
the
age
of
the
dictators
independence
without
liberty
and
statehood
without
respect
for
law
are
phrases
which
sum
up
the
situation
in
spanish
america
after
the
failure
of
bolivar
great
design
the
outcome
was
a
collection
of
crude
republics
racked
by
internal
dissension
and
torn
by
mutual
jealousy
patrias
bobas
or
foolish
fatherlands
as
one
of
their
own
writers
has
termed
them
now
that
the
bond
of
unity
once
supplied
by
spain
had
been
broken
the
entire
region
which
had
been
its
continental
domain
in
america
dissolved
awhile
into
its
elements
the
spanish
language
the
traditions
and
customs
of
the
dominant
class
and
a
republican
form
of
government
were
practically
the
sole
ties
which
remained
laws
to
be
sure
had
been
enacted
providing
for
the
immediate
or
gradual
abolition
of
negro
slavery
and
for
an
improvement
in
the
status
of
the
indian
and
but
the
bulk
of
the
inhabitants
as
in
colonial
times
remained
outside
of
the
body
politic
and
social
though
the
constitutions
might
confer
upon
the
colored
inhabitants
all
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
if
they
could
read
and
write
and
even
a
chance
to
hold
office
if
they
could
show
possession
of
a
sufficient
income
or
of
a
professional
title
of
some
sort
their
usual
inability
to
do
either
made
their
privileges
illusory
their
only
share
in
public
concerns
lay
in
performing
military
service
at
the
behest
of
their
superiors
even
where
the
language
of
the
constitutions
did
not
exclude
the
colored
inhabitants
directly
or
indirectly
practical
authority
was
exercised
by
dictators
who
played
the
autocrat
or
by
liberators
who
aimed
at
the
enjoyment
of
that
function
themselves
not
all
the
dictators
however
were
selfish
tyrants
nor
all
the
liberators
mere
pretenders
disturbed
conditions
bred
by
twenty
years
of
warfare
antique
methods
of
industry
a
backward
commerce
inadequate
means
of
communication
and
a
population
ignorant
superstitious
and
scant
made
a
strong
ruler
more
or
less
indispensable
whatever
his
official
designation
the
dictator
was
the
logical
successor
of
the
spanish
viceroy
or
captain
general
but
without
the
sense
of
responsibility
or
the
legal
restraint
of
either
these
circumstances
account
for
that
curious
political
phase
in
the
development
of
the
spanish
american
nations
the
presidential
despotism
on
the
other
hand
the
men
who
denounced
oppression
unscrupulousness
and
venality
and
who
in
rhetorical
pronunciamentos
urged
the
people
to
overthrow
the
dictators
were
often
actuated
by
motives
of
patriotism
even
though
they
based
their
declarations
on
assumptions
and
assertions
rather
than
on
principles
and
facts
not
infrequently
a
liberator
of
this
sort
became
provisional
president
until
he
himself
or
some
person
of
his
choice
could
be
elected
constitutional
president
two
other
institutions
more
or
less
peculiar
to
spanish
america
in
an
atmosphere
of
political
theorizing
mingled
with
ambition
for
personal
advancement
both
leaders
and
followers
were
professed
devotees
of
constitutions
no
people
it
was
thought
could
maintain
a
real
republic
and
be
a
true
democracy
if
they
did
not
possess
a
written
constitution
the
longer
this
was
the
more
precise
its
definition
of
powers
and
liberties
the
more
authentic
the
republic
and
the
more
genuine
the
democracy
was
thought
to
be
in
some
countries
the
notion
was
carried
still
farther
by
an
insistence
upon
frequent
changes
in
the
fundamental
law
or
in
the
actual
form
of
government
not
so
much
to
meet
imperative
needs
as
to
satisfy
a
zest
for
experimentation
or
to
suit
the
whims
of
mercurial
temperaments
the
congresses
constituent
assemblies
and
the
like
which
drew
these
instruments
were
supposed
to
be
faithful
reproductions
of
similar
bodies
abroad
and
to
represent
the
popular
will
in
fact
however
they
were
substantially
colonial
cabildos
enlarged
into
the
semblance
of
a
legislature
intent
upon
local
or
personal
concerns
and
lacking
any
national
consciousness
in
any
case
the
members
were
apt
to
be
creatures
of
a
republican
despot
or
else
delegates
of
politicians
or
petty
factions
assuming
that
the
leaders
had
a
fairly
clear
conception
of
what
they
wanted
even
if
the
mass
of
their
adherents
did
not
it
is
possible
to
aline
the
factions
or
parties
somewhat
as
follows
on
the
one
hand
the
unitary
the
military
the
clerical
the
conservative
and
the
moderate
on
the
other
the
federalist
the
civilian
the
lay
the
liberal
and
the
radical
interspersed
among
them
were
the
advocates
of
a
presidential
or
congressional
system
like
that
of
the
united
states
the
upholders
of
a
parliamentary
regime
like
that
of
european
nations
and
the
supporters
of
methods
of
government
of
a
more
experimental
kind
broadly
speaking
the
line
of
cleavage
was
made
by
opinions
concerning
the
form
of
government
and
by
convictions
regarding
the
relations
of
church
and
state
these
opinions
were
mainly
a
product
of
revolutionary
experience
these
convictions
on
the
other
hand
were
a
bequest
from
colonial
times
the
unitaries
wished
to
have
a
system
of
government
modeled
upon
that
of
france
they
wanted
the
various
provinces
made
into
administrative
districts
over
which
the
national
authority
should
exercise
full
sway
their
direct
opponents
the
federalists
resembled
to
some
extent
the
antifederalists
rather
than
the
party
bearing
the
former
title
in
the
earlier
history
of
the
united
states
but
even
here
an
exact
analogy
fails
they
did
not
seek
to
have
the
provinces
enjoy
local
or
to
have
perpetuated
the
traditions
of
a
sort
of
municipal
home
rule
handed
down
from
the
colonial
cabildos
so
much
as
to
secure
the
recognition
of
a
number
of
isolated
villages
or
small
towns
as
sovereign
states
which
meant
turning
them
over
as
fiefs
to
their
local
chieftains
federalism
therefore
was
the
spanish
american
expression
for
a
feudalism
upheld
by
military
lordlets
and
their
retainers
among
the
measures
of
reform
introduced
by
one
republic
or
another
during
the
revolutionary
period
abolition
of
the
inquisition
had
been
one
of
the
foremost
otherwise
comparatively
little
was
done
to
curb
the
influence
of
the
church
indeed
the
earlier
constitutions
regularly
contained
articles
declaring
roman
catholicism
the
sole
legal
faith
as
well
as
the
religion
of
the
state
and
safeguarding
in
other
respects
its
prestige
in
the
community
here
was
an
institution
wealthy
proud
and
influential
which
declined
to
yield
its
ancient
prerogatives
and
privileges
and
to
that
end
relied
upon
the
support
of
clericals
and
conservatives
who
disliked
innovations
of
a
democratic
sort
and
viewed
askance
the
entry
of
immigrants
professing
an
alien
faith
opposed
to
the
church
stood
governments
verging
on
bankruptcy
desirous
of
exercising
supreme
control
and
dominated
by
individuals
eager
to
put
theories
of
democracy
into
practice
and
to
throw
open
the
doors
of
the
republic
freely
to
newcomers
from
other
lands
in
the
opinion
of
these
radicals
the
church
ought
to
be
deprived
both
of
its
property
and
of
its
monopoly
of
education
the
one
should
be
turned
over
to
the
nation
to
which
it
properly
belonged
and
should
be
converted
into
public
utilities
the
other
should
be
made
absolutely
secular
in
order
to
destroy
clerical
influence
over
the
youthful
mind
in
this
program
radicals
and
liberals
concurred
with
varying
degrees
of
intensity
while
the
moderates
strove
to
hold
the
balance
between
them
and
their
opponents
out
of
this
complex
situation
civil
commotions
were
bound
to
arise
occasionally
these
were
real
wars
but
as
a
rule
only
skirmishes
or
sporadic
insurrections
occurred
they
were
called
revolutions
not
because
some
great
principle
was
actually
at
stake
but
because
the
term
had
been
popular
ever
since
the
struggle
with
spain
as
a
designation
for
movements
aimed
at
securing
rotation
in
office
and
hence
control
of
the
treasury
it
was
appropriate
enough
at
all
events
whether
serious
or
farcical
the
commotions
often
involved
an
expenditure
in
life
and
money
far
beyond
the
value
of
the
interests
affected
further
both
the
prevalent
disorder
and
the
centralization
of
authority
impelled
the
educated
and
classes
to
take
up
their
residence
at
the
seat
of
government
not
a
few
of
the
uprisings
were
in
fact
protests
on
the
part
of
the
neglected
folk
in
the
interior
of
the
country
against
concentration
of
population
wealth
intellect
and
power
in
the
spanish
american
capitals
among
the
towns
of
this
sort
was
buenos
aires
here
in
rosas
inaugurated
a
career
of
rulership
over
the
argentine
confederation
culminating
in
a
despotism
that
made
him
the
most
extraordinary
figure
of
his
time
originally
a
stockfarmer
and
skilled
in
all
the
exercises
of
the
cowboy
he
developed
an
unusual
talent
for
administration
his
keen
intelligence
supple
statecraft
inflexibility
of
purpose
and
vigor
of
action
united
to
a
shrewd
understanding
of
human
follies
and
passions
gave
to
his
personality
a
dominance
that
awed
and
to
his
word
of
command
a
power
that
humbled
over
his
fellow
chieftains
who
held
the
provinces
in
terrorized
subjection
he
won
an
ascendancy
that
insured
compliance
with
his
will
the
instincts
of
the
multitude
he
flattered
by
his
generous
simplicity
while
he
enlisted
the
support
of
the
responsible
class
by
maintaining
order
in
the
countryside
the
desire
also
of
buenos
aires
to
be
paramount
over
the
other
provinces
had
no
small
share
in
strengthening
his
power
relatively
honest
in
money
matters
and
a
stickler
for
precision
and
uniformity
rosas
sought
to
govern
a
nation
in
the
fashion
of
the
stock
farm
a
creature
of
his
environment
no
better
and
no
worse
than
his
associates
but
only
more
capable
than
they
and
absolutely
convinced
that
pitiless
autocracy
was
the
sole
means
of
creating
a
nation
out
of
chaotic
fragments
this
robespierre
of
south
america
carried
on
his
despotic
sway
regardless
of
the
fury
of
opponents
and
the
menace
of
foreign
intervention
during
the
first
three
years
of
his
control
however
except
for
the
rigorous
suppression
of
unitary
movements
and
the
muzzling
of
the
press
few
signs
appeared
of
the
black
night
of
argentine
history
which
was
soon
to
close
down
on
the
land
realizing
that
the
auspicious
moment
had
not
yet
arrived
for
him
to
exercise
the
limitless
power
that
he
thought
needful
he
declined
an
offer
of
reelection
from
the
provincial
legislature
in
the
hope
that
through
a
policy
of
conciliation
his
successor
might
fall
a
prey
to
the
designs
of
the
unitaries
when
this
happened
he
secretly
stirred
up
the
provinces
into
a
renewal
of
the
earlier
disturbances
until
the
evidence
became
overwhelming
that
rosas
alone
could
bring
peace
and
progress
out
of
turmoil
and
backwardness
reluctantly
the
legislature
yielded
him
the
power
it
knew
he
wanted
this
he
would
not
accept
until
a
popular
vote
of
some
to
confirmed
the
choice
in
accordingly
he
became
dictator
for
the
first
of
four
successive
terms
of
five
years
then
ensued
notably
in
buenos
aires
itself
a
state
of
affairs
at
once
grotesque
and
frightful
not
content
with
hunting
down
and
inflicting
every
possible
outrage
upon
those
suspected
of
sympathy
with
the
unitaries
rosas
forbade
them
to
display
the
light
blue
and
white
colors
of
their
party
device
and
directed
that
red
the
sign
of
federalism
should
be
displayed
on
all
occasions
pink
he
would
not
tolerate
as
being
too
attenuated
a
shade
and
altogether
too
suggestive
of
political
trimming
a
band
of
his
followers
made
up
of
ruffians
and
called
the
mazorca
or
ear
of
corn
because
of
the
resemblance
of
their
close
fellowship
to
its
adhering
grains
broke
into
private
houses
destroyed
everything
light
blue
within
reach
and
maltreated
the
unfortunate
occupants
at
will
no
man
was
safe
also
who
did
not
give
his
face
a
leonine
aspect
by
wearing
a
mustache
and
sidewhiskers
emblems
the
one
of
federalism
and
the
other
of
independence
to
possess
a
visage
bare
of
these
hirsute
adornments
or
a
countenance
too
efflorescent
in
that
respect
was
under
a
regime
of
tonsorial
politics
to
invite
personal
disaster
nothing
apparently
was
too
cringing
or
servile
to
show
how
submissive
the
people
were
to
the
mastery
of
rosas
private
vengeance
and
defamation
of
the
innocent
did
their
sinister
work
unchecked
even
when
his
arbitrary
treatment
of
foreigners
had
compelled
france
for
a
while
to
institute
a
blockade
of
buenos
aires
the
wily
dictator
utilized
the
incident
to
turn
patriotic
resentment
to
his
own
advantage
meanwhile
matters
in
uruguay
had
come
to
such
a
pass
that
rosas
saw
an
opportunity
to
extend
his
control
in
that
direction
also
placed
between
brazil
and
the
argentine
confederation
and
so
often
a
bone
of
contention
the
little
country
was
hardly
free
from
the
rule
of
the
former
state
when
it
came
near
falling
under
the
domination
of
the
latter
only
a
few
years
of
relative
tranquillity
had
elapsed
when
two
parties
sprang
up
in
uruguay
the
reds
colorados
and
the
whites
blancos
of
these
the
one
was
supposed
to
represent
the
liberal
and
the
other
the
conservative
element
in
fact
they
were
the
followings
of
partisan
chieftains
whose
struggles
for
the
presidency
during
many
years
to
come
retarded
the
advancement
of
a
country
to
which
nature
had
been
generous
when
fructuoso
rivera
the
president
up
to
thought
of
choosing
some
one
to
be
elected
in
constitutional
fashion
as
his
successor
he
unwisely
singled
out
manuel
oribe
one
of
the
famous
who
had
raised
the
cry
of
independence
a
decade
before
but
instead
of
a
henchman
he
found
a
rival
both
of
them
straightway
adopted
the
colors
and
bid
for
the
support
of
one
of
the
local
factions
and
both
appealed
to
the
factions
of
the
argentine
confederation
for
aid
rivera
to
the
unitaries
and
oribe
to
the
federalists
in
oribe
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
blancos
and
federalists
and
with
the
moral
support
of
rosas
laid
siege
to
montevideo
defended
by
colorados
unitaries
and
numerous
foreigners
including
giuseppe
garibaldi
the
town
held
out
valiantly
for
eight
years
a
feat
that
earned
for
it
the
title
of
the
new
troy
anxious
to
stop
the
slaughter
and
destruction
that
were
injuring
their
nationals
france
great
britain
and
brazil
offered
their
mediation
but
rosas
would
have
none
of
it
what
the
antagonists
did
he
cared
little
so
long
as
they
enfeebled
the
country
and
increased
his
chances
of
dominating
it
at
length
in
the
two
european
powers
established
a
blockade
of
argentine
ports
which
was
not
lifted
until
the
dictator
grudgingly
agreed
to
withdraw
his
troops
from
the
neighboring
republic
more
than
any
other
single
factor
this
intervention
of
france
and
great
britain
administered
a
blow
to
rosas
from
which
he
could
not
recover
the
operations
of
their
fleets
and
the
resistance
of
montevideo
had
lowered
the
prestige
of
the
dictator
and
had
raised
the
hopes
of
the
unitaries
that
a
last
desperate
effort
might
shake
off
his
hated
control
in
may
justo
jose
de
urquiza
one
of
his
most
trusted
lieutenants
declared
the
independence
of
his
own
province
and
called
upon
the
others
to
rise
against
the
tyrant
enlisting
the
support
of
brazil
uruguay
and
paraguay
he
assembled
a
great
army
of
liberation
composed
of
about
thousand
men
at
whose
head
he
marched
to
meet
the
redoubtable
rosas
on
february
at
a
spot
near
buenos
aires
the
man
of
might
who
like
his
contemporary
francia
in
paraguay
had
held
the
argentine
confederation
in
thralldom
for
so
many
years
went
down
to
final
defeat
embarking
on
a
british
warship
he
sailed
for
england
there
to
become
a
quiet
country
gentleman
in
a
land
where
gauchos
and
dictators
were
unhonored
in
the
meantime
paraguay
spared
from
such
convulsion
as
racked
its
neighbor
on
the
east
dragged
on
its
secluded
existence
of
backwardness
and
stagnation
indians
and
vegetated
in
ignorance
and
docility
and
the
handful
of
whites
quaked
in
terror
while
the
inexorable
francia
tightened
the
reins
of
commercial
and
industrial
restriction
and
erected
forts
along
the
frontiers
to
keep
out
the
pernicious
foreigner
at
his
death
in
men
and
women
wept
at
his
funeral
in
fear
perchance
as
one
historian
remarks
lest
he
come
back
to
life
and
the
priest
who
officiated
at
the
service
likened
the
departed
dictator
to
caesar
and
augustus
paraguay
was
destined
however
to
fall
under
a
despot
far
worse
than
francia
when
in
francisco
solano
lopez
became
president
the
new
ruler
was
a
man
of
considerable
intelligence
and
education
while
a
traveler
in
europe
he
had
seen
much
of
its
military
organizations
and
he
had
also
gained
no
slight
acquaintance
with
the
vices
of
its
capital
cities
this
acquired
knowledge
he
joined
to
evil
propensities
until
he
became
a
veritable
monster
of
wickedness
vain
arrogant
reckless
absolutely
devoid
of
scruple
swaggering
in
victory
dogged
in
defeat
ferociously
cruel
at
all
times
he
murdered
his
brothers
and
his
best
friends
he
executed
imprisoned
or
banished
any
one
whom
he
thought
too
influential
he
tortured
his
mother
and
sisters
and
like
the
french
terrorists
he
impaled
his
officers
upon
the
unpleasant
dilemma
of
winning
victories
or
losing
their
lives
even
members
of
the
american
legation
suffered
torment
at
his
hands
and
the
minister
himself
barely
escaped
death
over
his
people
lopez
wielded
a
marvelous
power
compounded
of
persuasive
eloquence
and
brute
force
if
the
paraguayans
had
obeyed
their
earlier
masters
blindly
they
were
dumb
before
this
new
despot
and
deaf
to
other
than
his
word
of
command
to
them
he
was
the
great
father
who
talked
to
them
in
their
own
tongue
of
guarani
who
was
the
personification
of
the
nation
the
greatest
ruler
in
the
world
the
invincible
champion
who
inspired
them
with
a
loathing
and
contempt
for
their
enemies
such
were
the
traits
of
a
man
and
such
the
traits
of
a
people
who
waged
for
six
years
a
warfare
among
the
most
extraordinary
in
human
annals
what
prompted
lopez
to
embark
on
his
career
of
international
madness
and
prosecute
it
with
the
rage
of
a
demon
is
not
entirely
clear
a
vision
of
himself
as
the
napoleon
of
southern
south
america
who
might
cause
brazil
argentina
and
uruguay
to
cringe
before
his
footstool
while
he
disposed
at
will
of
their
territory
and
fortunes
doubtless
stirred
his
imagination
so
too
the
thought
of
his
country
wedged
in
between
two
huge
neighbors
and
threatened
with
suffocation
between
their
overlapping
folds
may
well
have
suggested
the
wisdom
of
conquering
overland
a
highway
to
the
sea
at
all
events
he
assembled
an
army
of
upwards
of
ninety
thousand
men
the
greatest
military
array
that
hispanic
america
had
ever
seen
though
admirably
drilled
and
disciplined
they
were
poorly
armed
mostly
with
flintlock
muskets
and
they
were
also
deficient
in
artillery
except
that
of
antiquated
pattern
with
this
mighty
force
at
his
back
yet
knowing
that
the
neighboring
countries
could
eventually
call
into
the
field
armies
much
larger
in
size
equipped
with
repeating
rifles
and
supplied
with
modern
artillery
the
jupiter
of
paraguay
nevertheless
made
ready
to
launch
his
thunderbolt
the
primary
object
at
which
he
aimed
was
uruguay
in
this
little
state
the
colorados
upheld
openly
or
secretly
by
brazil
and
argentina
were
conducting
a
crusade
of
liberty
against
the
blanco
government
at
montevideo
which
was
favored
by
paraguay
neither
of
the
two
great
powers
wished
to
see
an
alliance
formed
between
uruguay
and
paraguay
lest
when
united
in
this
manner
the
smaller
nations
might
become
too
strong
to
tolerate
further
intervention
in
their
affairs
for
her
part
brazil
had
motives
for
resentment
arising
out
of
boundary
disputes
with
paraguay
and
uruguay
as
well
as
out
of
the
inevitable
injury
to
its
nationals
inflicted
by
the
commotions
in
the
latter
country
whereas
argentina
cherished
grievances
against
lopez
for
the
audacity
with
which
his
troops
roamed
through
her
provinces
and
the
impudence
with
which
his
vessels
plying
on
the
lower
parana
ignored
the
customs
regulations
thus
it
happened
that
obscure
civil
discords
in
one
little
republic
exploded
into
a
terrific
international
struggle
which
shook
south
america
to
its
foundations
in
scorning
the
arts
of
diplomacy
which
he
did
not
apparently
understand
lopez
sent
down
an
order
for
the
two
big
states
to
leave
the
matter
of
uruguayan
politics
to
his
impartial
adjustment
at
both
rio
de
janeiro
and
buenos
aires
a
roar
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
press
at
this
notion
of
an
obscure
chieftain
of
a
band
of
indians
in
the
tropical
backwoods
daring
to
poise
the
equilibrium
of
much
more
than
half
a
continent
on
his
insolent
hand
but
the
merriment
soon
subsided
as
brazilians
and
argentinos
came
to
realize
what
their
peril
might
be
from
a
huge
army
of
skilled
and
valiant
soldiers
a
veritable
horde
of
fighting
fanatics
drawn
up
in
a
compact
little
land
centrally
located
and
affording
in
other
respects
every
kind
of
strategic
advantage
when
brazil
invaded
uruguay
and
restored
the
colorados
to
power
lopez
demanded
permission
from
argentina
to
cross
its
frontier
for
the
purpose
of
assailing
his
enemy
from
another
quarter
when
the
permission
was
denied
lopez
declared
war
on
argentina
also
it
was
in
every
respect
a
daring
step
but
lopez
knew
that
argentina
was
not
so
well
prepared
as
his
own
state
for
a
war
of
endurance
uruguay
then
entered
into
an
alliance
in
with
its
two
big
protectors
in
accordance
with
its
terms
the
allies
agreed
not
to
conclude
peace
until
lopez
had
been
overthrown
heavy
indemnities
had
been
exacted
of
paraguay
its
fortifications
demolished
its
army
disbanded
and
the
country
forced
to
accept
any
boundaries
that
the
victors
might
see
fit
to
impose
into
the
details
of
the
campaigns
in
the
frightful
conflict
that
ensued
it
is
not
necessary
to
enter
although
in
the
allies
had
assembled
an
army
of
some
fifty
thousand
men
lopez
continued
taking
the
offensive
until
as
the
number
and
determination
of
his
adversaries
increased
he
was
compelled
to
retreat
into
his
own
country
here
he
and
his
indian
legions
levied
terrific
toll
upon
the
lives
of
their
enemies
who
pressed
onward
up
or
down
the
rivers
and
through
tropical
swamps
and
forests
inch
by
inch
he
contested
their
entry
upon
paraguayan
soil
when
the
men
gave
out
old
men
boys
women
and
girls
fought
on
with
stubborn
fury
and
died
before
they
would
surrender
the
wounded
escaped
if
they
could
or
cursing
their
captors
tore
off
their
bandages
and
bled
to
death
disease
wrought
awful
havoc
in
all
the
armies
engaged
yet
the
struggle
continued
until
flesh
and
blood
could
endure
no
more
flying
before
his
pursuers
into
the
wilds
of
the
north
and
frantically
dragging
along
with
him
masses
of
fugitive
men
women
and
children
whom
he
remorselessly
shot
or
starved
to
death
or
left
to
perish
of
exhaustion
lopez
turned
finally
at
bay
and
on
march
was
felled
by
the
lance
of
a
cavalryman
he
had
sworn
to
die
for
his
country
and
he
did
though
his
country
might
perish
with
him
no
land
in
modern
times
has
ever
reached
a
point
so
near
annihilation
as
paraguay
added
to
the
utter
ruin
of
its
industries
and
the
devastation
of
its
fields
dwellings
and
towns
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
women
and
children
had
perished
indeed
the
horrors
that
had
befallen
it
might
well
have
led
the
allies
to
ask
themselves
whether
it
was
worth
while
to
destroy
a
country
in
order
to
change
its
rulers
five
years
before
lopez
came
into
power
the
population
of
paraguay
had
been
reckoned
at
something
between
and
so
unreliable
were
census
returns
in
those
days
in
it
was
estimated
at
about
of
whom
women
over
fifteen
years
of
age
outnumbered
the
men
nearly
four
to
one
loose
polygamy
was
the
inevitable
consequence
and
women
became
the
breadwinners
even
today
in
this
country
the
excess
of
females
over
males
is
very
great
all
in
all
it
is
not
strange
that
paraguay
should
be
called
the
niobe
among
nations
unlike
many
nations
of
spanish
america
in
which
a
more
or
less
anticlerical
regime
was
in
the
ascendant
ecuador
fell
under
a
sort
of
theocracy
here
appeared
one
of
the
strangest
characters
in
a
story
already
full
of
extraordinary
personages
gabriel
garcia
moreno
who
became
president
of
that
republic
in
in
some
respects
the
counterpart
of
francia
of
paraguay
in
others
both
a
medieval
mystic
and
an
enlightened
ruler
of
modern
type
he
was
a
man
of
remarkable
intellect
constructive
ability
earnest
patriotism
and
disinterested
zeal
for
orderliness
and
progress
on
his
presidential
sash
were
inscribed
the
words
my
power
in
the
constitution
but
is
real
power
lay
in
himself
and
in
the
system
which
he
implanted
garcia
moreno
had
a
varied
career
he
had
been
a
student
of
chemistry
and
other
natural
sciences
he
had
spent
his
youth
in
exile
in
europe
where
he
prepared
himself
for
his
subsequent
career
as
a
journalist
and
a
university
professor
through
it
all
he
had
been
an
active
participant
in
public
affairs
grim
of
countenance
austere
in
bearing
violent
of
temper
relentless
in
severity
he
was
a
devoted
believer
in
the
roman
catholic
faith
and
in
this
church
as
the
sole
effective
basis
upon
which
a
state
could
be
founded
or
social
and
political
regeneration
could
be
assured
in
order
to
render
effective
his
concept
of
what
a
nation
ought
to
be
garcia
moreno
introduced
and
upheld
in
all
rigidity
an
administration
the
like
of
which
had
been
known
hardly
anywhere
since
the
middle
ages
he
recalled
the
jesuits
established
schools
of
the
brothers
of
the
christian
doctrine
and
made
education
a
matter
wholly
under
ecclesiastical
control
he
forbade
heretical
worship
called
the
country
the
republic
of
the
sacred
heart
and
entered
into
a
concordat
with
the
pope
under
which
the
church
in
ecuador
became
more
subject
to
the
will
of
the
supreme
pontiff
than
western
europe
had
been
in
the
days
of
innocent
iii
liberals
in
and
outside
of
ecuador
tried
feebly
to
shake
off
this
masterful
theocracy
for
the
friendship
which
garcia
moreno
displayed
toward
the
diplomatic
representatives
of
the
catholic
powers
of
europe
notably
those
of
spain
and
france
excited
the
neighboring
republics
colombia
indeed
sent
an
army
to
liberate
the
brother
democrats
of
ecuador
from
the
rule
of
professor
garcia
moreno
but
the
mass
of
the
people
stood
loyally
by
their
president
for
this
astounding
obedience
to
an
administration
apparently
so
unrelated
to
modern
ideas
the
ecclesiastical
domination
was
not
solely
or
even
chiefly
responsible
in
more
ways
than
one
garcia
moreno
the
professor
president
was
a
statesman
of
vision
and
deed
he
put
down
brigandage
and
lawlessness
reformed
the
finances
erected
hospitals
promoted
education
and
encouraged
the
study
of
natural
science
even
his
salary
he
gave
over
to
public
improvements
his
successors
in
the
presidential
office
found
it
impossible
to
govern
the
country
without
garcia
moreno
elected
for
a
third
term
to
carry
on
his
curious
policy
of
conservatism
and
reaction
blended
with
modern
advancement
he
fell
by
the
hand
of
an
assassin
in
but
the
system
which
he
had
done
so
much
to
establish
in
ecuador
survived
him
for
many
years
although
brazil
did
not
escape
the
evils
of
insurrection
which
retarded
the
growth
of
nearly
all
of
its
neighbors
none
of
its
numerous
commotions
shook
the
stability
of
the
nation
to
a
perilous
degree
by
all
danger
of
revolution
had
vanished
the
country
began
to
enter
upon
a
career
of
peace
and
progress
under
a
regime
which
combined
broadly
the
federal
organization
of
the
united
states
with
the
form
of
a
constitutional
monarchy
brazil
enjoyed
one
of
the
few
enlightened
despotisms
in
south
america
adopting
at
the
outset
the
parliamentary
system
the
emperor
pedro
ii
chose
his
ministers
from
among
the
liberals
or
conservatives
as
one
party
or
the
other
might
possess
a
majority
in
the
lower
house
of
the
congress
though
the
legislative
power
of
the
nation
was
enjoyed
almost
entirely
by
the
planters
and
their
associates
who
formed
the
dominant
social
class
individual
liberty
was
fully
guaranteed
and
even
freedom
of
conscience
and
of
the
press
was
allowed
negro
slavery
though
tolerated
was
not
expressly
recognized
thanks
to
the
political
discretion
and
unusual
personal
qualities
of
dom
pedro
his
popularity
became
more
and
more
marked
as
the
years
went
on
a
patron
of
science
and
literature
a
scholar
rather
than
a
ruler
a
placid
and
somewhat
eccentric
philosopher
careless
of
the
trappings
of
state
he
devoted
himself
without
stint
to
the
public
welfare
shrewdly
divining
that
the
monarchical
system
might
not
survive
much
longer
he
kept
his
realm
pacified
by
a
policy
of
conciliation
pedro
ii
even
went
so
far
as
to
call
himself
the
best
republican
in
the
empire
he
might
have
said
with
justice
perhaps
that
he
was
the
best
republican
in
the
whole
of
hispanic
america
what
he
really
accomplished
was
the
successful
exercise
of
a
paternal
autocracy
of
kindness
and
liberality
over
his
subjects
if
more
or
less
permanent
dictators
and
occasional
liberators
were
the
order
of
the
day
in
most
of
the
spanish
american
republics
intermittent
dictators
and
liberators
dashed
across
the
stage
in
mexico
from
well
beyond
the
middle
of
the
century
the
other
countries
could
show
numerous
instances
in
which
the
occupant
of
the
chief
magistracy
held
office
to
the
close
of
his
constitutional
term
but
mexico
could
not
show
a
single
one
what
mexico
furnished
instead
was
a
kaleidoscopic
spectacle
of
successive
presidents
or
dictators
an
unstable
array
of
generals
without
a
presidential
succession
there
were
no
fewer
than
fifty
such
transient
rulers
in
years
with
anywhere
from
one
to
six
a
year
with
even
the
same
incumbent
twice
in
one
year
or
in
the
case
of
the
repetitious
santa
anna
nine
times
in
twenty
years
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
term
of
office
was
four
years
this
was
a
record
that
made
the
most
turbulent
south
american
states
seem
by
comparison
lands
of
methodical
regularity
in
the
choice
of
their
national
executive
and
as
if
this
instability
in
the
chief
magistracy
were
not
enough
the
form
of
government
in
mexico
shifted
violently
from
federal
to
centralized
and
back
again
to
federal
mad
struggles
raged
between
partisan
chieftains
and
their
bands
of
escoceses
and
yorkinos
crying
out
upon
the
president
in
power
because
of
his
undue
influence
upon
the
choice
of
a
successor
backing
their
respective
candidates
if
they
lost
and
waiting
for
a
chance
to
oust
them
if
they
won
this
tumultuous
epoch
had
scarcely
begun
when
spain
in
made
a
final
attempt
to
recover
her
lost
dominion
in
mexico
local
quarrels
were
straightway
dropped
for
two
months
until
the
invaders
had
surrendered
thereupon
the
great
landholders
who
disliked
the
prevailing
yorkino
regime
for
its
democratic
policies
and
for
favoring
the
abolition
of
slavery
rallied
to
the
aid
of
a
general
who
issued
a
manifesto
demanding
an
observance
of
the
constitution
and
the
laws
after
santa
anna
who
was
playing
the
role
of
a
mexican
warwick
had
disposed
of
this
aspirant
he
switched
blithely
over
to
the
escoceses
reduced
the
federal
system
almost
to
a
nullity
and
in
marched
away
to
conquer
the
revolting
texans
but
instead
they
conquered
him
and
gained
their
independence
so
that
his
reward
was
exile
now
the
escoceses
were
free
to
promulgate
a
new
constitution
to
abolish
the
federal
arrangement
altogether
and
to
replace
it
by
a
strongly
centralized
government
under
which
the
individual
states
became
mere
administrative
districts
hardly
had
this
radical
change
been
effected
when
in
war
broke
out
with
france
on
account
of
the
injuries
which
its
nationals
among
whom
were
certain
pastry
cooks
had
suffered
during
the
interminable
commotions
mexico
was
forced
to
pay
a
heavy
indemnity
and
santa
anna
who
had
returned
to
fight
the
invader
was
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
a
leg
in
the
struggle
this
physical
deprivation
however
did
not
interfere
with
that
doughty
hero
zest
for
tilting
with
other
unquiet
spirits
who
yearned
to
assure
national
regeneration
by
continuing
to
elevate
and
depose
presidents
another
swing
of
the
political
pendulum
had
restored
the
federal
system
when
again
everything
was
overturned
by
the
disastrous
war
with
the
united
states
once
more
santa
anna
returned
this
time
however
to
joust
in
vain
with
the
yankee
despoilers
who
were
destined
to
dismember
mexico
and
to
annex
of
its
territory
again
santa
anna
was
banished
to
dream
of
a
more
favorable
opportunity
when
he
might
become
the
savior
of
a
country
which
had
fallen
into
bankruptcy
and
impotence
his
opportunity
came
in
when
conservatives
and
clericals
indulged
the
fatuous
hope
that
he
would
both
sustain
their
privileges
and
lift
mexico
out
of
its
sore
distress
either
their
memories
were
short
or
else
distance
had
cast
a
halo
about
his
figure
at
all
events
he
returned
from
exile
and
assumed
for
the
ninth
and
last
time
a
presidency
which
he
intended
to
be
something
more
than
a
mere
dictatorship
scorning
the
formality
of
a
congress
he
had
himself
entitled
most
serene
highness
as
indicative
of
his
ambition
to
become
a
monarch
in
name
as
well
as
in
fact
royal
or
imperial
designs
had
long
since
brought
one
military
upstart
to
grief
they
were
now
to
cut
santa
anna
residence
in
mexico
similarly
short
eruptions
of
discontent
broke
out
all
over
the
country
unable
to
make
them
subside
santa
anna
fell
back
upon
an
expedient
which
recalls
practices
elsewhere
in
spanish
america
he
opened
registries
in
which
all
citizens
might
record
freely
their
approval
or
disapproval
of
his
continuance
in
power
though
he
obtained
the
huge
majority
of
affirmative
votes
to
be
expected
in
such
cases
he
found
that
these
signatures
were
no
more
serviceable
than
his
soldiers
accordingly
the
dictator
of
many
a
day
fallen
from
his
former
estate
of
highness
decided
to
abandon
his
serenity
also
and
in
fled
the
country
for
its
good
and
his
own
chapter
vi
peril
from
abroad
apart
from
the
spoliation
of
mexico
by
the
united
states
the
independence
of
the
hispanic
nations
had
not
been
menaced
for
more
than
thirty
years
now
comes
a
period
in
which
the
plight
of
their
big
northern
neighbor
rent
in
twain
by
civil
war
and
powerless
to
enforce
the
spirit
of
the
monroe
doctrine
caused
two
of
the
countries
to
become
subject
a
while
to
european
control
one
of
these
was
the
dominican
republic
in
the
population
of
the
eastern
part
of
the
island
of
santo
domingo
writhing
under
the
despotic
yoke
of
haiti
had
seized
a
favorable
occasion
to
regain
their
freedom
but
the
magic
word
independence
could
not
give
stability
to
the
new
state
any
more
than
it
had
done
in
the
case
of
its
western
foes
the
haitians
had
lapsed
long
since
into
a
condition
resembling
that
of
their
african
forefathers
they
reveled
in
the
barbarities
of
voodoo
a
sort
of
snake
worship
and
they
groveled
before
presidents
and
emperors
who
rose
and
fell
on
the
tide
of
decaying
civilization
the
dominicans
unhappily
were
not
much
more
progressive
revolutions
alternated
with
invasions
and
and
effectually
prevented
enduring
progress
on
several
occasions
the
dominicans
had
sought
reannexation
to
spain
or
had
craved
the
protection
of
france
as
a
defense
against
continual
menace
from
their
negro
enemies
and
as
a
relief
from
domestic
turmoil
but
every
move
in
this
direction
failed
because
of
a
natural
reluctance
on
the
part
of
spain
and
france
which
was
heightened
by
a
refusal
of
the
united
states
to
permit
what
it
regarded
as
a
violation
of
the
monroe
doctrine
in
however
the
outbreak
of
civil
war
in
the
united
states
appeared
to
present
a
favorable
opportunity
to
obtain
protection
from
abroad
if
the
dominican
republic
could
not
remain
independent
anyway
reunion
with
the
old
mother
country
seemed
altogether
preferable
to
reconquest
by
haiti
the
president
therefore
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
spanish
governor
and
captain
general
of
cuba
and
then
issued
a
proclamation
signed
by
himself
and
four
of
his
ministers
announcing
that
by
the
free
and
spontaneous
will
of
its
citizens
who
had
conferred
upon
him
the
power
to
do
so
the
nation
recognized
queen
isabella
ii
as
its
lawful
sovereign
practically
no
protest
was
made
by
the
dominicans
against
this
loss
of
their
independence
difficulties
which
should
have
been
foreseen
by
spain
were
quick
to
reveal
themselves
it
fell
to
the
expresident
now
a
colonial
governor
and
captain
general
to
appoint
a
host
of
officials
and
not
unnaturally
he
named
his
own
henchmen
by
so
doing
he
not
only
aroused
the
animosity
of
the
disappointed
but
stimulated
that
of
the
otherwise
disaffected
as
well
until
both
the
aggrieved
factions
began
to
plot
rebellion
spain
too
sent
over
a
crowd
of
officials
who
could
not
adjust
themselves
to
local
conditions
the
failure
of
the
mother
country
to
allow
the
dominicans
representation
in
the
spanish
cortes
and
its
readiness
to
levy
taxes
stirred
up
resentment
that
soon
ended
in
revolution
unable
to
check
this
new
trouble
and
awed
by
the
threatening
attitude
of
the
united
states
spain
decided
to
withdraw
in
the
dominicans
thus
were
left
with
their
independence
and
a
chance
which
they
promptly
seized
to
renew
their
commotions
so
serious
did
these
disturbances
become
that
in
the
president
of
the
reconstituted
republic
sought
annexation
to
the
united
states
but
without
success
american
efforts
on
the
other
hand
were
equally
futile
to
restore
peace
and
order
in
the
troubled
country
until
many
years
later
the
intervention
of
spain
in
santo
domingo
and
its
subsequent
withdrawal
could
not
fail
to
have
disastrous
consequences
in
its
colony
of
cuba
the
pearl
of
the
antilles
as
it
was
proudly
called
here
abundant
crops
of
sugar
and
tobacco
had
brought
wealth
and
luxury
but
not
many
immigrants
because
of
the
havoc
made
by
epidemics
of
yellow
fever
nearly
a
third
of
the
insular
population
was
still
composed
of
negro
slaves
who
could
hardly
relish
the
thought
that
while
the
mother
country
had
tolerated
the
suppression
of
the
hateful
institution
in
santo
domingo
she
still
maintained
it
in
cuba
a
bureaucracy
also
prone
to
corruption
owing
to
the
temptations
of
loose
accounting
at
the
custom
house
governed
in
routinary
if
not
in
arbitrary
fashion
under
these
circumstances
dislike
for
the
suspicious
and
repressive
administration
of
spain
grew
apace
and
secret
societies
renewed
their
agitation
for
its
overthrow
the
symptoms
of
unrest
were
aggravated
by
the
forced
retirement
of
spain
from
santo
domingo
if
the
dominicans
had
succeeded
so
well
it
ought
not
to
be
difficult
for
a
prolonged
rebellion
to
wear
spain
out
and
compel
it
to
abandon
cuba
also
at
this
critical
moment
news
was
brought
of
a
spanish
revolution
across
the
seas
just
as
the
plight
of
spain
in
and
again
in
had
afforded
a
favorable
opportunity
for
its
colonies
on
the
continents
of
america
to
win
their
independence
so
now
in
the
tidings
that
queen
isabella
had
been
dethroned
by
a
liberal
uprising
aroused
the
cubans
to
action
under
their
devoted
leader
carlos
manuel
de
cespedes
the
insurrection
had
not
gained
much
headway
however
when
the
provisional
government
of
the
mother
country
instructed
a
new
governor
and
captain
general
whose
name
dulce
sweet
had
an
auspicious
sound
to
open
negotiations
with
the
insurgents
and
to
hold
out
the
hope
of
reforms
but
the
royalists
now
as
formerly
would
listen
to
no
compromise
organizing
themselves
into
bodies
of
volunteers
they
drove
dulce
out
he
was
succeeded
by
one
caballero
de
rodas
knight
of
rhodes
who
lived
up
to
his
name
by
trying
to
ride
roughshod
over
the
rebellious
cubans
thus
began
the
ten
war
a
war
of
skirmishes
and
brief
encounters
rarely
involving
a
decisive
action
which
drenched
the
soil
of
cuba
with
blood
and
laid
waste
its
fields
in
a
fury
of
destruction
among
the
radicals
and
liberals
who
tried
to
retain
a
fleeting
control
over
mexico
after
the
final
departure
of
santa
anna
was
the
first
genuine
statesman
it
had
ever
known
in
its
history
as
a
republic
benito
pablo
juarez
an
indian
at
twelve
years
of
age
he
could
not
read
or
write
or
even
speak
spanish
his
employer
however
noted
his
intelligence
and
had
him
educated
becoming
a
lawyer
juarez
entered
the
political
arena
and
rose
to
prominence
by
dint
of
natural
talent
for
leadership
an
indomitable
perseverance
and
a
sturdy
patriotism
a
radical
by
conviction
he
felt
that
the
salvation
of
mexico
could
never
be
attained
until
clericalism
and
militarism
had
been
banished
from
its
soil
forever
under
his
influence
a
provisional
government
had
already
begun
a
policy
of
lessening
the
privileges
of
the
church
when
the
conservative
elements
with
a
cry
that
religion
was
being
attacked
rose
up
in
arms
again
this
movement
repressed
a
congress
proceeded
in
to
issue
a
liberal
constitution
which
was
destined
to
last
for
sixty
years
it
established
the
federal
system
in
a
definite
fashion
abolished
special
privileges
both
ecclesiastical
and
military
and
organized
the
country
on
sound
bases
worthy
of
a
modern
nation
mexico
seemed
about
to
enter
upon
a
rational
development
but
the
newly
elected
president
yielding
to
the
importunities
of
the
clergy
abolished
the
constitution
dissolved
the
legislature
and
set
up
a
dictatorship
in
spite
of
the
energetic
protests
of
juarez
who
had
been
chosen
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
and
who
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
temporarily
discarded
instrument
was
authorized
to
assume
the
presidency
should
that
office
fall
vacant
the
rule
of
the
usurper
was
however
various
improvised
generals
of
conservative
stripe
put
themselves
at
the
head
of
a
movement
to
save
country
religion
and
the
rights
of
the
army
drove
the
dictator
out
and
restored
the
old
regime
juarez
now
proclaimed
himself
acting
president
as
he
was
legally
entitled
to
do
and
set
up
his
government
at
vera
cruz
while
one
provisional
president
followed
another
throughout
this
trying
time
juarez
defended
his
position
vigorously
and
rejected
every
offer
of
compromise
in
he
promulgated
his
famous
reform
laws
which
nationalized
ecclesiastical
property
secularized
cemeteries
suppressed
religious
communities
granted
freedom
of
worship
and
made
marriage
a
civil
contract
for
mexico
however
as
for
other
spanish
american
countries
measures
of
the
sort
were
far
too
much
in
advance
of
their
time
to
insure
a
ready
acceptance
although
juarez
obtained
a
great
moral
victory
when
his
government
was
recognized
by
the
united
states
he
had
to
struggle
two
years
more
before
he
could
gain
possession
of
the
capital
triumphant
in
he
carried
his
anticlerical
program
to
the
point
of
actually
expelling
the
papal
nuncio
and
other
ecclesiastics
who
refused
to
obey
his
decrees
by
so
doing
he
leveled
the
way
for
the
clericals
conservatives
and
the
militarists
to
invite
foreign
intervention
on
behalf
of
their
desperate
cause
but
even
if
they
had
not
been
guilty
of
behavior
so
unpatriotic
the
anger
of
the
pope
over
the
treatment
of
his
church
the
wrath
of
spain
over
the
conduct
of
juarez
who
had
expelled
the
spanish
minister
for
siding
with
the
ecclesiastics
the
desire
of
great
britain
to
collect
debts
due
to
her
subjects
and
above
all
the
imperialistic
ambitions
of
napoleon
iii
who
dreamt
of
converting
the
intellectual
influence
of
france
in
hispanic
america
into
a
political
ascendancy
would
probably
have
led
to
european
occupation
in
any
event
so
long
at
least
as
the
united
states
was
slit
asunder
and
incapable
of
action
some
years
before
the
mexican
government
under
the
clerical
and
militarist
regime
had
made
a
contract
with
a
swiss
banker
who
for
a
payment
of
had
received
bonds
worth
more
than
fifteen
times
the
value
of
the
loan
when
therefore
the
mexican
congress
undertook
to
defer
payments
on
a
foreign
debt
that
included
the
proceeds
of
this
outrageous
contract
the
governments
of
france
great
britain
and
spain
decided
to
intervene
according
to
their
agreement
the
three
powers
were
simply
to
hold
the
seaports
of
mexico
and
collect
the
customs
duties
until
their
pecuniary
demands
had
been
satisfied
learning
however
that
napoleon
iii
had
ulterior
designs
great
britain
and
spain
withdrew
their
forces
and
left
him
to
proceed
with
his
scheme
of
conquest
after
capturing
puebla
in
may
a
french
army
numbering
some
thirty
thousand
men
entered
the
capital
and
installed
an
assemblage
of
notables
belonging
to
the
clerical
and
conservative
groups
this
body
thereupon
proclaimed
the
establishment
of
a
constitutional
monarchy
under
an
emperor
the
title
was
to
be
offered
to
maximilian
archduke
of
austria
in
case
he
should
not
accept
the
matter
was
to
be
referred
to
the
benevolence
of
his
majesty
the
emperor
of
the
french
who
might
then
select
some
other
catholic
prince
on
his
arrival
a
year
later
the
amiable
and
maximilian
soon
discovered
that
instead
of
being
an
emperor
he
was
actually
little
more
than
a
precarious
chief
of
a
faction
sustained
by
the
bayonets
of
a
foreign
army
in
the
northern
part
of
mexico
juarez
porfirio
diaz
later
to
become
the
most
renowned
of
presidential
autocrats
and
other
patriot
leaders
though
hunted
from
place
to
place
held
firmly
to
their
resolve
never
to
bow
to
the
yoke
of
the
pretender
nor
could
maximilian
be
sure
of
the
loyalty
of
even
his
supposed
adherents
little
by
little
the
unpleasant
conviction
intruded
itself
upon
him
that
he
must
either
abdicate
or
crush
all
resistance
in
the
hope
that
eventually
time
and
good
will
might
win
over
the
mexicans
but
do
what
they
would
his
foreign
legions
could
not
catch
the
wary
and
stubborn
juarez
and
his
guerrilla
lieutenants
who
persistently
wore
down
the
forces
of
their
enemies
then
the
financial
situation
became
grave
still
more
menacing
was
the
attitude
of
the
united
states
now
that
its
civil
war
was
at
an
end
on
may
maximilian
received
word
that
napoleon
iii
had
decided
to
withdraw
the
french
troops
he
then
determined
to
abdicate
but
he
was
restrained
by
the
unhappy
empress
carlotta
who
hastened
to
europe
to
plead
his
cause
with
napoleon
meantime
as
the
french
troops
were
withdrawn
juarez
occupied
the
territory
feebly
the
emperor
strove
to
enlist
the
favor
of
his
adversaries
by
a
number
of
liberal
decrees
but
their
sole
result
was
his
abandonment
by
many
a
lukewarm
conservative
inexorably
the
patriot
armies
closed
around
him
until
in
may
he
was
captured
at
queretaro
where
he
had
sought
refuge
denied
the
privilege
of
leaving
the
country
on
a
promise
never
to
return
he
asked
escobedo
his
captor
to
treat
him
as
a
prisoner
of
war
that
my
business
was
the
grim
reply
on
the
pretext
that
maximilian
had
refused
to
recognize
the
competence
of
the
military
court
chosen
to
try
him
juarez
gave
the
order
to
shoot
him
on
the
of
june
the
austrian
archduke
paid
for
a
fleeting
glory
with
his
life
thus
failed
the
second
attempt
at
erecting
an
empire
in
mexico
for
years
diplomatic
relations
between
that
country
and
were
severed
the
combination
had
been
overthrown
and
the
mexican
people
had
rearmed
their
independence
as
juarez
declared
peace
means
respect
for
the
rights
of
others
even
if
foreign
dreams
of
empire
in
mexico
had
vanished
so
abruptly
it
could
hardly
be
expected
that
a
land
torn
for
many
years
by
convulsions
could
become
suddenly
tranquil
with
diaz
and
other
aspirants
to
presidential
power
or
with
chieftains
who
aimed
at
setting
up
little
republics
of
their
own
in
the
several
states
juarez
had
to
contend
for
some
time
before
he
could
establish
a
fair
amount
of
order
under
his
successor
who
also
was
a
civilian
an
era
of
effective
reform
began
in
amendments
to
the

and

during
the
half
century
that
had
elapsed
since
the
nations
of
hispanic
america
had
passed
through
dark
ages
their
evolution
had
always
been
accompanied
by
growing
pains
and
had
at
times
been
arrested
altogether
or
unduly
hastened
by
harsh
injections
of

it
was
not
an

through

in

but
rather
a
fitful

by
the
arbitrary
deeds
of

of
action
good
and
bad
who
had
seized

however
steadily
decreased
in
number
and
gave

who
were
imbued
with
modern
ideas
in
these
hispanic
nations
stood
on
the
threshold
of
a
new
era
some
were
destined
to
advance
rapidly
beyond
it
others
to
move
slowly
onward
and
a
few
to
make
little
or
no

the
most
remarkable
feature
in
the
new

was
the
rise
of
four
states
mexico
brazil
argentina
and
chile
to
a
position
of
eminence
among
their
fellows
extent
of
territory
development
of
natural
resources
the
character
of
the
inhabitants
and
the
increase
of
their
numbers
and
the
amount
of
popular
intelligence
and
prosperity
all
contributed
to
this
end
each
of
the
four
nations
belonged
to
a
fairly
historical
and
geographical
group
in
southern
north
america
and
in
eastern
and
western
south

respectively
in

group
were

in

uruguay
and
paraguay
and
in
the
third
chile
peru
and
bolivia
in
a
fourth
group
were
ecuador
colombia
and
venezuela
when
the
president
of
mexico
proceeded
in
to
violate
the
constitution
by
securing
his
reelection
the
people
were
prepared
by
their
earlier
experiences
and
by
the
rule
of
juarez
to
defend
their
constitutional
rights
a
widespread
rebellion
headed
by
diaz
broke
out
in
the
plan
of
tuxtepec
the
revolutionists
declared
themselves
in
favor
of
the
principle
of
absolutely
no
reelection
meantime
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
handed
down
a
decision
that
the
action
of
the
congress
in
sustaining
the
president
was
illegal
since
in
reality
no
elections
had
been
held
because
of
the
abstention
of
voters
and
the
seizure
of
the
polls
by
revolutionists
or
government
forces
above
the
constitution
nothing
above
the
constitution
no
one
he
declared
but
as
this
assumption
of
a
power
of
judgment
on
matters
of
purely
political
concern
was
equally
a
violation
of
the
constitution
and
concealed
besides
an
attempt
to
make
the
chief
justice
president
diaz
and
his
followers
drove
both
of
the
pretenders
out
then
in
he
managed
to
bring
about
his
own
election
instead
porfirio
diaz
was
a
soldier
who
had
seen
active
service
in
nearly
every
important
campaign
since
the
war
with
the
united
states
often
himself
in
revolt
against
presidents
legal
and
illegal
diaz
was
vastly
more
than
an
ordinary
partisan
chieftain
schooled
by
a
long
experience
he
had
come
to
appreciate
the
fact
that
what
mexico
required
for
its
national
development
was
freedom
from
internal
disorders
and
a
fair
chance
for
recuperation
justice
order
and
prosperity
he
felt
could
be
assured
only
by
imposing
upon
the
country
the
heavy
weight
of
an
iron
hand
foreign
capital
must
be
invested
in
mexico
and
then
protected
immigration
must
be
encouraged
and
other
material
moral
and
intellectual
aid
of
all
sorts
must
be
drawn
from
abroad
for
the
upbuilding
of
the
nation
to
effect
such
a
transformation
in
a
land
so
tormented
and
impoverished
as
mexico
a
country
which
within
the
span
of
years
had
lived
under
two
emperors
and
some
presidents
nine
provisional
presidents
ten
dictators
twelve
regents
and
five
supreme
councilors
required
indeed
a
masterful
intelligence
and
a
masterful
authority
porfirio
diaz
possessed
and
exercised
both
he
was
in
fact
just
the
man
for
the
times
an
able
administrator
stern
and
severe
but
just
rather
reserved
in
manner
and
guarded
in
utterance
shrewd
in
the
selection
of
associates
and
singularly
successful
in
his
dealings
with
foreigners
he
entered
upon
a
presidential
reign
of
years
broken
by
but
one
intermission
of
four
which
brought
mexico
out
upon
the
highway
to
new
national
life
under
the
stable
and
efficient
rulership
of
diaz
plans
pronunciamentos
revolutions
and
similar
devices
of
professional
trouble
makers
had
short
shrift
whenever
an
uprising
started
it
was
promptly
quelled
either
by
a
army
or
by
the
rurales
a
mounted
police
made
up
to
some
extent
of
former
bandits
to
whom
the
president
gave
the
choice
of
police
service
or
of
sharp
punishment
for
their
crimes
order
in
fact
was
not
always
maintained
nor
was
justice
always
meted
out
by
recourse
to
judges
and
courts
instead
a
novel
kind
of
lynch
law
was
invoked
the
name
it
bore
was
the
ley
fuga
or
flight
law
in
accordance
with
which
malefactors
or
political
suspects
taken
by
government
agents
from
one
locality
to
another
on
the
excuse
of
securing
readier
justice
were
given
by
their
captors
a
pretended
chance
to
escape
and
were
then
shot
while
they
ran
the
only
difference
between
this
method
and
others
of
the
sort
employed
by
spanish
american
autocrats
to
enforce
obedience
lay
in
its
purpose
of
diaz
one
might
say
what
bacon
said
of
king
henry
vii
he
drew
blood
as
physicians
do
to
save
life
rather
than
to
spill
it
if
need
be
here
and
there
disorder
and
revolt
were
stamped
out
by
terrorism
but
the
mexican
people
did
not
yield
to
authority
from
terror
but
rather
from
a
thorough
loyalty
to
the
new
regime
among
the
numerous
measures
of
material
improvement
which
diaz
undertook
during
his
first
term
the
construction
of
railways
was
the
most
important
the
size
of
the
country
its
want
of
navigable
rivers
and
its
relatively
small
and
widely
scattered
population
made
imperative
the
establishment
of
these
means
of
communication
despite
the
misgivings
of
many
intelligent
mexicans
that
the
presence
of
foreign
capital
would
impair
local
independence
in
some
way
diaz
laid
the
foundations
of
future
national
prosperity
by
granting
concessions
to
the
mexican
central
and
national
mexican
companies
which
soon
began
construction
under
his
successor
a
national
bank
was
created
and
when
diaz
was
again
elected
he
readjusted
the
existing
foreign
debt
and
boldly
contracted
new
debts
abroad
at
the
close
of
his
first
term
in
a
surplus
in
the
treasury
was
not
so
great
a
novelty
as
the
circumstance
altogether
unique
in
the
political
annals
of
diaz
turned
over
the
presidency
in
peaceful
fashion
to
his
properly
elected
successor
he
did
so
reluctantly
to
be
sure
but
he
could
not
afford
just
yet
to
ignore
his
own
avowed
principle
which
had
been
made
a
part
of
the
constitution
shortly
after
his
accession
although
the
confidence
he
reposed
in
that
successor
was
not
entirely
justified
the
immense
personal
popularity
of
diaz
saved
the
prestige
of
the
new
chief
magistrate
under
his
administration
the
constitution
was
amended
in
such
a
way
as
to
deprive
the
chief
justice
of
the
privilege
of
replacing
the
president
in
case
of
a
vacancy
thus
eliminating
that
official
from
politics
after
his
resumption
of
office
diaz
had
the
fundamental
law
modified
anew
so
as
to
permit
the
reelection
of
a
president
for
one
term
only
for
this
change
inconsistent
though
it
may
seem
diaz
was
not
alone
responsible
circumstances
had
changed
and
the
constitution
had
to
change
with
them
had
the
united
provinces
of
central
america
as
they
came
forth
from
under
the
rule
of
spain
seen
fit
to
abstain
from
following
in
the
unsteady
footsteps
of
mexico
up
to
the
time
of
the
accession
of
diaz
to
power
had
they
done
nothing
more
than
develop
their
natural
wealth
and
utilize
their
admirable
geographical
situation
they
might
have
become
prosperous
and
kept
their
corporate
name
as
it
was
their
history
for
upwards
of
forty
years
had
little
to
record
other
than
a
momentary
cohesion
and
a
subsequent
lapse
into
five
quarrelsome
little
republics
the
balkan
states
of
america
among
them
costa
rica
had
suffered
least
from
arbitrary
management
or
internal
commotion
and
showed
the
greatest
signs
of
advancement
in
guatemala
however
there
had
arisen
another
diaz
though
a
man
quite
inferior
in
many
respects
to
his
northern
counterpart
when
justo
rufino
barrios
became
president
of
that
republic
in
he
was
believed
to
have
conservative
leanings
ere
long
however
he
astounded
his
compatriots
by
showing
them
that
he
was
a
thoroughgoing
radical
with
methods
of
action
to
correspond
to
his
convictions
not
only
did
he
keep
the
jesuits
out
of
the
country
but
he
abolished
monastic
orders
altogether
and
converted
their
buildings
to
public
use
he
made
marriage
a
civil
contract
and
he
secularized
the
burying
grounds
education
he
encouraged
by
engaging
the
services
of
foreign
instructors
and
he
brought
about
a
better
observance
of
the
law
by
the
promulgation
of
new
codes
he
also
introduced
railways
and
telegraph
lines
since
the
manufacture
of
aniline
dyes
abroad
had
diminished
the
demand
for
cochineal
barrios
decided
to
replace
this
export
by
cultivating
coffee
to
this
end
he
distributed
seeds
among
the
planters
and
furnished
financial
aid
besides
with
a
promise
to
inspect
the
fields
in
due
season
and
see
what
had
been
accomplished
finding
that
in
many
cases
the
seeds
had
been
thrown
away
and
the
money
wasted
in
drink
and
gambling
he
ordered
the
guilty
planters
to
be
given
fifty
lashes
with
the
assurance
that
on
a
second
offense
he
would
shoot
them
on
sight
coffee
planting
in
guatemala
was
pursued
thereafter
with
much
alacrity
posts
in
the
government
service
barrios
distributed
quite
impartially
among
conservatives
and
democrats
deserving
or
otherwise
for
he
had
them
both
well
under
control
at
his
behest
a
permanent
constitution
was
promulgated
in
while
he
affected
to
dislike
continual
reelection
he
saw
to
it
nevertheless
that
he
himself
should
be
the
sole
candidate
who
was
likely
to
win
barrios
doubtless
could
have
remained
president
of
guatemala
for
the
term
of
his
natural
life
if
he
had
not
raised
up
the
ghost
of
federation
all
the
republics
of
central
america
accepted
his
invitation
in
to
send
delegates
to
his
capital
to
discuss
the
project
but
nothing
was
accomplished
because
barrios
and
the
president
of
salvador
were
soon
at
loggerheads
nine
years
later
feeling
himself
stronger
barrios
again
proposed
federation
but
the
other
republics
had
by
this
time
learned
too
much
of
the
methods
of
the
autocrat
of
guatemala
even
while
they
admired
his
progressive
policy
to
relish
the
thought
of
a
federation
dominated
by
guatemala
and
its
masterful
president
though
he
persuaded
honduras
to
accept
the
plan
the
three
other
republics
preferred
to
unite
in
and
in
the
ensuing
struggle
the
quixotic
barrios
was
killed
a
few
years
later
the
project
was
revived
and
the
constitution
of
a
republic
of
central
america
was
agreed
upon
when
war
between
guatemala
and
salvador
again
frustrated
its
execution
in
brazil
two
great
movements
were
by
this
time
under
way
the
total
abolition
of
slavery
and
the
establishment
of
a
republic
despite
the
tenacious
opposition
of
many
of
the
planters
from
about
the
year
the
movement
for
emancipation
made
great
headway
there
was
a
growing
determination
on
the
part
of
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
to
remove
the
blot
that
made
the
country
an
object
of
reproach
among
the
civilized
states
of
the
world
provinces
and
towns
one
after
another
freed
the
slaves
within
their
borders
the
imperial
government
on
its
part
hastened
the
process
by
liberating
its
own
slaves
and
by
imposing
upon
those
still
in
bondage
taxes
higher
than
their
market
value
it
fixed
a
price
for
other
slaves
it
decreed
that
the
older
slaves
should
be
set
free
and
it
increased
the
funds
already
appropriated
to
compensate
owners
of
slaves
who
should
be
emancipated
in
the
number
of
slaves
had
fallen
to
about
worth
legally
about
each
a
year
later
came
the
final
blow
when
the
princess
regent
assented
to
a
measure
which
abolished
slavery
outright
and
repealed
all
former
acts
relating
to
slavery
so
radical
a
proceeding
wrought
havoc
in
the
southern
provinces
in
particular
from
which
the
negroes
now
freed
migrated
by
tens
of
thousands
to
the
northern
provinces
their
places
however
were
taken
by
italians
and
other
europeans
who
came
to
work
the
plantations
on
a
cooperative
basis
all
through
the
eighties
in
fact
immigrants
from
italy
poured
into
the
temperate
regions
of
southern
brazil
to
the
number
of
nearly
two
hundred
thousand
supplementing
the
many
thousands
of
germans
who
had
settled
chiefly
in
the
province
of
rio
grande
do
sul
thirty
years
before
apart
from
the
industrial
problem
thus
created
by
the
abolition
of
slavery
there
seemed
to
be
no
serious
political
or
economic
questions
before
the
country
ever
since
when
a
law
providing
for
direct
elections
was
passed
the
liberals
had
been
in
full
control
the
old
dom
pedro
who
had
endeared
himself
to
his
people
was
as
much
liked
and
respected
as
ever
but
as
he
had
grown
feeble
and
almost
blind
the
heiress
to
the
throne
who
had
marked
absolutist
and
clerical
tendencies
was
disposed
to
take
advantage
of
his
infirmities
for
many
years
on
the
other
hand
doctrines
opposed
to
the
principle
of
monarchy
had
been
spread
in
zealous
fashion
by
members
of
the
military
class
notable
among
whom
was
deodoro
da
fonseca
and
now
some
of
the
planters
longed
to
wreak
vengeance
on
a
ruler
who
had
dared
to
thwart
their
will
by
emancipating
the
slaves
besides
this
persistent
discontent
radical
republican
newspapers
continually
stirred
up
fresh
agitation
whatever
the
personal
service
rendered
by
the
emperor
to
the
welfare
of
the
country
to
them
he
represented
a
political
system
which
deprived
the
provinces
of
much
of
their
local
autonomy
and
the
brazilian
people
at
large
of
but
the
chief
reason
for
the
momentous
change
which
was
about
to
take
place
was
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
monarchy
had
really
completed
its
work
as
a
transitional
government
under
that
regime
brazil
had
reached
a
condition
of
stability
and
had
attained
a
level
of
progress
which
might
well
enable
it
to
govern
itself
during
all
this
time
the
influence
of
the
spanish
american
nations
had
been
growing
apace
even
if
they
had
fallen
into
many
a
political
calamity
they
were
nevertheless
republics
and
to
the
south
american
this
word
had
a
magic
sound
above
all
there
was
the
potent
suggestion
of
the
success
of
the
united
states
of
north
america
whose
extension
of
its
federal
system
over
a
vast
territory
suggested
what
brazil
with
its
provinces
might
accomplish
in
the
southern
continent
hence
the
vast
majority
of
intelligent
brazilians
felt
that
they
had
become
enough
to
establish
a
republic
without
fear
of
lapsing
into
the
unfortunate
experiences
of
the
other
hispanic
countries
in
when
provision
was
made
for
a
speedy
abdication
of
the
emperor
in
favor
of
his
daughter
the
republican
newspapers
declared
that
a
scheme
was
being
concocted
to
exile
the
chief
military
agitators
and
to
interfere
with
any
effort
on
the
part
of
the
army
to
prevent
the
accession
of
the
new
ruler
thereupon
on
the
of
november
the
radicals
at
rio
de
janeiro
aided
by
the
garrison
broke
out
in
open
revolt
proclaiming
the
establishment
of
a
federal
republic
under
the
name
of
the
united
states
of
brazil
they
deposed
the
imperial
ministry
set
up
a
provisional
government
with
deodoro
da
fonseca
at
its
head
arranged
for
the
election
of
a
constitutional
convention
and
bade
dom
pedro
and
his
family
leave
the
country
within
hours
on
the
of
november
before
daybreak
the
summons
was
obeyed
not
a
soul
appeared
to
bid
the
old
emperor
farewell
as
he
and
his
family
boarded
the
steamer
that
was
to
bear
them
to
exile
in
europe
though
seemingly
an
act
of
heartlessness
and
ingratitude
the
precaution
was
a
wise
one
in
that
it
averted
possible
conflict
and
bloodshed
for
the
second
time
in
its
history
a
fundamental
change
had
been
wrought
in
the
political
system
of
the
nation
without
a
resort
to
war
the
united
states
of
brazil
accordingly
took
its
place
peacefully
among
its
fellow
republics
of
the
new
world
meanwhile
argentina
the
great
neighbor
of
brazil
to
the
southwest
had
been
gaining
territory
and
new
resources
since
the
definite
adoption
of
a
federal
constitution
in
this
state
had
attained
to
a
considerable
degree
of
national
consciousness
under
the
leadership
of
able
presidents
such
as
bartolome
mitre
the
soldier
and
historian
and
domingo
faustino
sarmiento
the
publicist
and
promoter
of
popular
education
one
evidence
of
this
new
nationalism
was
a
widespread
belief
in
the
necessity
of
territorial
expansion
knowing
that
chile
entertained
designs
upon
patagonia
the
argentine
government
forestalled
any
action
by
conducting
a
war
of
practical
extermination
against
the
indian
tribes
of
that
region
and
by
adding
it
to
the
national
domain
the
conquest
of
the
desert
in
the
far
south
of
the
continent
opened
to
civilization
a
vast
habitable
area
of
untold
economic
possibilities
in
the
electoral
campaign
of
the
presidential
candidates
were
julio
argentino
roca
and
the
governor
of
the
province
of
buenos
aires
the
former
an
able
officer
skilled
in
both
arms
and
politics
had
on
his
side
the
advantage
of
a
reputation
won
in
the
struggle
with
the
patagonian
indians
the
approval
of
the
national
government
and
the
support
of
most
of
the
provinces
feeling
certain
of
defeat
at
the
polls
the
partisans
of
the
latter
candidate
resorted
to
the
timeworn
expedient
of
a
revolt
though
the
uprising
lasted
but
twenty
days
the
diplomatic
corps
at
the
capital
proffered
its
mediation
between
the
contestants
in
order
to
avoid
any
further
bloodshed
the
result
was
that
the
fractious
governor
withdrew
his
candidacy
and
a
radical
change
was
effected
in
the
relations
of
buenos
aires
city
and
province
to
the
country
at
large
the
city
together
with
its
environs
was
converted
into
a
federal
district
and
became
solely
and
distinctively
the
national
capital
its
public
buildings
railways
and
telegraph
service
as
well
as
the
provincial
debt
were
taken
over
by
the
general
government
the
seat
of
provincial
authority
was
transferred
to
the
village
of
ensenada
which
thereupon
was
rechristened
la
plata
a
veritable
tide
of
wealth
and
general
prosperity
was
now
rolling
over
argentina
by
its
population

risen
to
upwards
of
immigration

to
a
point
far
beyond
the
wildest
expectations
in
alone
about
newcomers

and
lent
their
aid
in
the
promotion
of
industry
and
commerce
fields
hitherto
uncultivated
or
given
over
to
grazing
now
bore
vast
crops
of
wheat
maize
linseed
and
sugar
large
quantities
of
capital
chiefly
from
great
britain
also
poured
into
the
country
as
a
result
the
price
of
land
rose
high
and
feverish
speculation
became
the
order
of
the
day
banks
and
other
institutions
of
credit
were
set
up
colonizing
schemes
were
devised
and
railways
were
laid
out
to
meet
the
demands
of
all
these
enterprises
the
government
borrowed
immense
sums
from
foreign
capitalists
and
issued
vast
quantities
of
paper
money
with
little
regard
for
its
ultimate
redemption
argentina
spent
huge
sums
in
prodigal
fashion
on
all
sorts
of
public
improvements
in
an
effort
to
attract
still
more
capital
and
immigration
and
thus
entered
upon
a
dangerous
era
of
inflation
of
the
near
neighbors
of
argentina
uruguay
continued
along
the
tortuous
path
of
alternate
disturbance
and
progress
losing
many
of
its
inhabitants
to
the
greater
states
beyond
where
they
sought
relative
peace
and
security
while
paraguay
on
the
other
hand
enjoyed
freedom
from
civil
strife
though
weighed
down
with
a
war
debt
and
untold
millions
in
indemnities
exacted
by
argentina
and
brazil
which
it
could
never
hope
to
pay
in
consequence
this
indebtedness
was
a
useful
club
to
brandish
over
powerless
paraguay
whenever
that
little
country
might
venture
to
question
the
right
of
either
of
its
big
neighbors
to
break
the
promise
they
had
made
of
keeping
its
territory
intact
argentina
however
consented
in
to
refer
certain
claims
to
the
decision
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
when
paraguay
won
the
arbitration
it
showed
its
gratitude
by
naming
one
of
its
localities
villa
hayes
as
time
went
on
however
its
population
increased
and
hid
many
of
the
scars
of
war
on
the
western
side
of
south
america
there
broke
out
the
struggle
known
as
the
war
of
the
pacific
between
chile
on
the
one
side
and
peru
and
bolivia
as
allies
on
the
other
in
peru
unstable
and
corrupt
governments
had
contracted
foreign
loans
under
conditions
that
made
their
repayment
almost
impossible
and
had
spent
the
proceeds
in
so
reckless
and
extravagant
a
fashion
as
to
bring
the
country
to
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
bolivia
similarly
governed
was
still
the
scene
of
the
orgies
and
carnivals
which
had
for
some
time
characterized
its
unfortunate
history
one
of
its
buffoon
presidents
moreover
had
entered
into
boundary
agreements
with
both
chile
and
brazil
under
which
the
nation
lost
several
important
areas
and
some
of
its
territory
on
the
pacific
the
boundaries
of
bolivia
indeed
were
run
almost
everywhere
on
purely
arbitrary
lines
drawn
with
scant
regard
for
the
physical
features
of
the
country
and
with
many
a
frontier
question
left
wholly
unsettled
for
some
years
chilean
companies
and
speculators
aided
by
foreign
capital
mainly
british
in
origin
had
been
working
deposits
of
nitrate
of
soda
in
the
province
of
antofagasta
or
the
desert
of
atacama
a
region
along
the
coast
to
the
northward
belonging
to
bolivia
and
also
in
the
provinces
of
tacna
arica
and
tarapaca
still
farther
to
the
northward
belonging
to
peru
because
boundary
lines
were
not
altogether
clear
and
because
the
three
countries
were
all
eager
to
exploit
these
deposits
controversies
over
this
debatable
ground
were
sure
to
rise
for
the
privilege
of
developing
portions
of
this
region
individuals
and
companies
had
obtained
concessions
from
the
various
governments
concerned
elsewhere
industrial
free
lances
dug
away
without
reference
to
such
formalities
it
is
quite
likely
that
chile
whose
motto
was
by
right
or
by
might
was
prepared
to
sustain
the
claims
of
its
citizens
by
either
alternative
at
all
events
scenting
a
prospective
conflict
chile
had
devoted
much
attention
to
the
development
of
its
naval
and
military
establishment
a
state
of
affairs
which
did
not
escape
the
observation
of
its
suspicious
neighbors
the
policy
of
peru
was
determined
partly
by
personal
motives
and
partly
by
reasons
of
state
in
the
president
lacking
sufficient
financial
and
political
support
to
keep
himself
in
office
resolved
upon
the
risky
expedient
of
arousing
popular
passion
against
chile
in
the
hope
that
he
might
thereby
replenish
the
national
treasury
accordingly
he
proceeded
to
pick
a
quarrel
by
ordering
the
deposits
in
tarapaca
to
be
expropriated
with
scant
respect
for
the
concessions
made
to
the
chilean
miners
realizing
however
the
possible
consequences
of
such
an
action
he
entered
into
an
alliance
with
bolivia
this
country
thereupon
proceeded
to
levy
an
increased
duty
on
the
exportation
of
nitrates
from
the
atacama
region
chile
already
aware
of
the
hostile
combination
which
had
been
formed
protested
so
vigorously
that
a
year
later
bolivia
agreed
to
withdraw
the
new
regulations
and
to
submit
the
dispute
to
arbitration
such
were
the
relations
of
these
three
states
in
when
bolivia
taking
advantage
of
differences
of
opinion
between
chile
and
argentina
regarding
the
patagonian
region
reimposed
its
export
duty
canceled
the
chilean
concessions
and
confiscated
the
nitrate
deposits
chile
then
declared
war
in
february
and
within
two
months
occupied
the
entire
coast
of
bolivia
up
to
the
frontiers
of
peru
on
his
part
the
president
of
bolivia
was
too
much
engrossed
in
the
festivities
connected
with
a
masquerade
to
bother
about
notifying
the
people
that
their
land
had
been
invaded
until
several
days
after
the
event
had
occurred
misfortunes
far
worse
than
anything
which
had
fallen
to
the
lot
of
its
ally
now
awaited
peru
which
first
attempted
an
officious
mediation
and
then
declared
war
on
the
of
april
since
peru
and
bolivia
together
had
a
population
double
that
of
chile
and
since
peru
possessed
a
much
larger
army
and
navy
than
chile
the
allies
counted
confidently
on
victory
but
peru
army
of
eight
thousand
having
within
four
hundred
as
many
officers
as
men
directed
by
no
fewer
than
generals
and
presided
over
by
a
civil
government
altogether
inept
was
no
match
for
an
army
less
than
a
third
of
its
size
to
be
sure
but
well
drilled
and
commanded
and
with
a
stable
progressive
and
efficient
government
at
its
back
the
peruvian
forces
lacking
any
substantial
support
from
bolivia
crumpled
under
the
terrific
attacks
of
their
adversaries
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
to
mediate
in
the
struggle
were
blocked
by
the
dogged
refusal
of
chile
to
abate
its
demands
for
annexation
early
in
its
army
entered
lima
in
triumph
and
the
war
was
over
for
a
while
the
victors
treated
the
peruvians
and
their
capital
city
shamefully
the
chilean
soldiers
stripped
the
national
library
of
its
contents
tore
up
the
in
the
streets
carried
away
the
benches
in
the
parks
and
even
shipped
off
the
local
menagerie
to
santiago
what
they
did
not
remove
or
destroy
was
disposed
of
by
the
rabble
of
lima
itself
but
in
two
years
so
utterly
chaotic
did
the
conditions
in
the
hapless
country
become
that
chile
at
length
had
to
set
up
a
government
in
order
to
conclude
a
peace
it
was
not
until
october
that
the
treaty
was
signed
at
lima
and
ratified
later
at
ancon
peru
was
forced
to
cede
tarapaca
outright
and
to
agree
that
tacna
and
arica
should
be
held
by
chile
for
ten
years
at
the
expiration
of
this
period
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
provinces
were
to
be
allowed
to
choose
by
vote
the
country
to
which
they
would
prefer
to
belong
and
the
nation
that
won
the
election
was
to
pay
the
loser
pesos
in
april
bolivia
also
entered
into
an
arrangement
with
chile
according
to
which
a
portion
of
its
seacoast
should
be
ceded
absolutely
and
the
remainder
should
be
occupied
by
chile
until
a
more
definite
understanding
on
the
matter
could
be
reached
chile
emerged
from
the
war
not
only
triumphant
over
its
northern
rivals
but
dominant
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america
important
developments
in
chilean
national
policy
followed
to
maintain
its
vantage
and
to
guard
against
reprisals
the
victorious
state
had
to
keep
in
military
readiness
on
land
and
sea
it
therefore
looked
to
prussia
for
a
pattern
for
its
army
and
to
great
britain
for
a
model
for
its
navy
peru
had
suffered
cruelly
from
the
war
its
territorial
losses
deprived
it
of
an
opportunity
to
satisfy
its
foreign
creditors
through
a
grant
of
concessions
the
public
treasury
too
was
empty
and
many
a
private
fortune
had
melted
away
not
until
a
military
hand
stronger
than
its
competitors
managed
to
secure
a
firm
grip
on
affairs
did
peru
begin
once
more
its
toilsome
journey
toward
material
betterment
bolivia
on
its
part
had
emerged
from
the
struggle
practically
a
landlocked
country
though
bereft
of
access
to
the
sea
except
by
permission
of
its
neighbors
it
had
however
not
endured
anything
like
the
calamities
of
its
ally
in
it
had
adopted
a
permanent
constitution
and
it
now
entered
upon
a
course
of
slow
and
relatively
peaceful
progress
in
the
republics
to
the
northward
struggles
between
clericals
and
radicals
caused
sharp
abrupt
alternations
in
government
in
ecuador
the
hostility
between
clericals
and
radicals
was
all
the
more
bitter
because
of
the
rivalry
of
the
two
chief
towns
guayaquil
the
seaport
and
quito
the
capital
each
of
which
sheltered
a
faction
no
sooner
therefore
had
garcia
moreno
fallen
than
the
radicals
of
guayaquil
rose
up
against
the
clericals
at
quito
once
in
power
they
hunted
their
enemies
down
until
order
under
a
dictator
could
be
restored
the
military
president
who
assumed
power
in
was
too
radical
to
suit
the
clericals
and
too
clerical
to
suit
the
radicals
accordingly
his
opponents
decided
to
make
the
contest
by
fighting
the
dictator
and
one
another
when
the
president
had
been
forced
out
a
conservative
took
charge
until
parties
of
bushwhackers
and
mutinous
soldiers
were
able
to
install
a
military
leader
whose
retention
of
power
was
brief
in
another
conservative
who
had
been
absent
from
the
country
when
elected
and
who
was
an
adept
in
law
and
diplomacy
managed
to
win
sufficient
support
from
all
three
factions
to
retain
office
for
the
constitutional
period
in
colombia
a
financial
crisis
had
been
approaching
ever
since
the
price
of
coffee
cocoa
and
other
colombian
products
had
fallen
in
the
european
markets
this
decrease
had
caused
a
serious
diminution
in
the
export
trade
and
had
forced
gold
and
silver
practically
out
of
circulation
at
the
same
time
the
various
states
were
increasing
their
powers
at
the
expense
of
the
federal
government
and
the
country
was
rent
by
factions
in
order
to
give
the
republic
a
thoroughly
centralized
administration
which
would
restore
financial
confidence
and
bring
back
the
influence
of
the
church
as
a
social
and
political
factor
a
genuine
revolution
which
was
started
in
eventually
put
an
end
to
both
radicalism
and
states
rights
at
the
outset
rafael
nunez
the
unitary
and
clerical
candidate
and
a
lawyer
by
profession
was
beaten
on
the
field
but
at
a
subsequent
election
he
obtained
the
requisite
number
of
votes
and
in
assumed
the
presidency
that
the
loser
in
war
should
become
the
victor
in
peace
showed
the
futility
of
bloodshed
in
such
revolutions
not
until
nunez
came
into
office
again
did
he
feel
himself
strong
enough
to
uproot
altogether
the
radicalism
and
disunion
which
had
flourished
since
ignoring
the
national
legislature
he
called
a
congress
of
his
own
which
in
framed
a
constitution
that
converted
the
sovereign
states
into
departments
or
mere
administrative
districts
to
be
ruled
as
the
national
government
saw
fit
further
the
presidential
term
was
lengthened
from
two
years
to
six
and
the
name
of
the
country
was
changed
finally
to
republic
of
colombia
two
years
later
the
power
of
the
church
was
strengthened
by
a
concordat
with
the
pope
venezuela
on
its
part
had
undergone
changes
no
less
marked
a
liberal
constitution
promulgated
in
had
provided
for
the
reorganization
of
the
country
on
a
federal
basis
the
name
chosen
for
the
republic
was
united
states
of
venezuela
more
than
that
it
had
anticipated
mexico
and
guatemala
in
being
the
first
of
the
hispanic
nations
to
witness
the
establishment
of
a
presidential
autocracy
of
the
continuous
and
enlightened
type
antonio
guzman
blanco
was
the
man
who
imposed
upon
venezuela
for
about
nineteen
years
a
regime
of
obedience
to
law
and
to
some
extent
of
modern
ideas
of
administration
such
as
the
country
had
never
known
before
a
person
of
much
versatility
he
had
studied
medicine
and
law
before
he
became
a
soldier
and
a
politician
later
he
displayed
another
kind
of
versatility
by
letting
henchmen
hold
the
presidential
office
while
he
remained
the
power
behind
the
throne
endowed
with
a
masterful
will
and
a
pronounced
taste
for
minute
supervision
he
had
exactly
the
ability
necessary
to
rule
venezuela
wisely
and
well
amid
considerable
opposition
he
began
in
the
first
of
his
three
periods
of
administration
the
septennium
as
it
was
termed
the
sovereign
states
he
governed
through
sovereign
officials
of
his
own
selection
he
stopped
the
plundering
of
farms
and
the
dragging
of
laborers
off
to
military
service
he
established
in
venezuela
an
excellent
monetary
system
great
sums
were
expended
in
the
erection
of
public
and
private
buildings
and
in
the
embellishment
of
caracas
european
capital
and
immigration
were
encouraged
to
venture
into
a
country
hitherto
so
torn
by
chronic
disorder
as
to
deprive
both
labor
and
property
of
all
guarantees
roads
railways
and
telegraph
lines
were
constructed
the
ministers
of
the
church
were
rendered
submissive
to
the
civil
power
primary
education
became
alike
free
and
compulsory
as
the
phrase
went
guzman
blanco
taught
venezuela
to
read
at
the
end
of
his
term
of
office
he
went
into
voluntary
retirement
in
guzman
blanco
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
movement
which
he
called
a
revolution
of
replevin
which
meant
presumably
that
he
was
opposed
to
presidential
continuism
and
in
favor
of
republican
institutions
although
a
constitution
promulgated
in
fixed
the
chief
magistrate
term
of
office
at
two
years
the
success
which
guzman
blanco
had
attained
enabled
him
to
control
affairs
for
five
years
the
quinquennium
as
it
was
called
thereupon
he
procured
his
appointment
to
a
diplomatic
post
in
europe
but
the
popular
demand
for
his
presence
was
too
strong
for
him
to
remain
away
in
he
was
elected
by
acclamation
he
held
office
two
years
more
and
then
finding
that
his
influence
had
waned
he
left
venezuela
for
good
whatever
his
faults
in
other
respects
guzman
blanco
be
it
said
to
his
credit
tried
to
destroy
the
pest
of
periodical
revolutions
in
his
country
thanks
to
his
vigorous
suppression
of
these
uprisings
some
years
of
at
least
comparative
security
were
made
possible
more
than
any
other
president
the
nation
had
ever
had
he
was
entitled
to
the
distinction
of
having
been
a
benefactor
if
not
altogether
a
regenerator
of
his
native
land
chapter
viii
on
the
margin
of
international
life
during
the
period
from
to
two
incidents
revealed
the
standing
that
the
republics
of
hispanic
america
had
now
acquired
in
the
world
at
large
in
at
washington
and
later
in
their
own
capital
cities
they
met
with
the
united
states
in
council
in
and
again
in
they
joined
their
great
northern
neighbor
and
the
nations
of
europe
and
asia
at
the
hague
for
deliberation
on
mutual
concerns
and
they
were
admitted
to
an
international
fellowship
and
cooperation
far
beyond
a
mere
recognition
of
their
independence
and
a
formal
interchange
of
diplomats
and
consuls
since
attempts
of
the
hispanic
countries
themselves
to
realize
the
aims
of
bolivar
in
calling
the
congress
at
panama
had
failed
the
united
states
now
undertook
to
call
into
existence
a
sort
of
congress
instead
of
being
merely
a
supporter
the
great
republic
of
the
north
had
resolved
to
become
the
director
of
the
movement
for
greater
solidarity
in
thought
and
action
by
linking
up
the
concerns
of
the
hispanic
nations
with
its
own
destinies
it
would
assert
not
so
much
its
position
as
guardian
of
the
monroe
doctrine
as
its
headship
if
not
its
actual
dominance
in
the
new
world
and
would
so
widen
the
bounds
of
its
political
and
commercial
influence
a
tendency
known
as
imperialism
such
was
the
way
at
least
in
which
the
hispanic
republics
came
to
view
the
action
of
the
colossus
of
the
north
in
inviting
them
to
participate
in
an
assemblage
meeting
more
or
less
periodically
and
termed
officially
the
international
conference
of
american
states
and
popularly
the
conference
whether
the
mistrust
the
smaller
countries
felt
at
the
outset
was
lessened
in
any
degree
by
the
attendance
of
their
delegates
at
the
sessions
of
this
conference
remains
open
to
question
although
these
representatives
in
common
with
their
colleagues
from
the
united
states
assented
to
a
variety
of
conventions
and
passed
a
much
larger
number
of
resolutions
their
acquiescence
seemed
due
to
a
desire
to
gratify
their
powerful
associate
rather
than
to
a
belief
in
the
possible
utility
of
such
measures
the
experience
of
the
earlier
gatherings
had
demonstrated
that
political
issues
would
have
to
be
excluded
from
consideration
propositions
for
example
such
as
that
to
extend
the
basic
idea
of
the
monroe
doctrine
into
a
sort
of
ordinance
under
which
all
the
nations
of
america
should
agree
to
abstain
thereafter
from
acquiring
any
part
of
one
another
territory
by
conquest
and
to
adopt
also
the
principle
of
compulsory
arbitration
proved
impossible
of
acceptance
accordingly
from
that
time
onward
the
matters
treated
by
the
conference
dealt
for
the
most
part
with
innocuous
though
often
praiseworthy
projects
for
bringing
the
united
states
and
its
sister
republics
into
closer
commercial
industrial
and
intellectual
relations
the
gathering
itself
on
the
other
hand
became
to
a
large
extent
a
fiesta
a
festive
occasion
for
the
display
of
social
amenities
much
as
the
hispanic
americans
missed
their
favorite
topic
of
politics
they
found
consolation
in
entertaining
the
distinguished
foreign
visitors
with
the
genial
courtesy
and
generous
hospitality
for
which
they
are
famous
as
one
of
their
periodicals
later
expressed
it
since
a
discussion
of
politics
was
tabooed
it
were
better
to
devote
the
sessions
of
the
conference
to
talking
about
music
and
lyric
poetry
at
all
events
as
far
as
the
outcome
was
concerned
their
national
legislatures
ratified
comparatively
few
of
the
conventions
among
the
hispanic
nations
of
america
only
mexico
took
part
in
the
first
conference
at
the
hague
practically
all
of
them
were
represented
at
the
second
the
appearance
of
their
delegates
at
these
august
assemblages
of
the
powers
of
earth
was
viewed
for
a
while
with
mixed
feelings
the
attitude
of
the
great
powers
towards
them
resembled
that
of
parents
of
the
old
regime
children
at
the
international
table
should
be
seen
and
not
heard
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
hispanic
americans
were
both
seen
and
heard
especially
the
latter
they
were
able
to
show
the
europeans
that
even
if
they
did
happen
to
come
from
relatively
weak
states
they
possessed
a
skillful
intelligence
a
breadth
of
knowledge
a
capacity
for
expression
and
a
consciousness
of
national
character
which
would
not
allow
them
simply
to
play
man
friday
to
an
international
crusoe
the
president
of
the
second
conference
indeed
confessed
that
they
had
been
a
revelation
to
him
hence
as
time
went
on
the
progress
and
possibilities
of
the
republics
of
hispanic
america
came
to
be
appreciated
more
and
more
by
the
world
at
large
gradually
people
began
to
realize
that
the
countries
south
of
the
united
states
were
not
merely
an
indistinguishable
block
on
the
map
to
be
referred
to
vaguely
as
central
and
south
america
or
as
latin
america
the
reading
public
at
least
knew
that
these
countries
were
quite
different
from
one
another
both
in
achievements
and
in
prospects
yet
the
fact
remains
that
despite
their
active
part
in
these
american
and
european
conferences
the
hispanic
countries
of
the
new
world
did
not
receive
the
recognition
which
they
felt
was
their
due
their
national
associates
in
the
european
gatherings
were
disinclined
to
admit
that
the
possession
of
independence
and
sovereignty
entitled
them
to
equal
representation
on
international
council
boards
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
therefore
they
continued
to
stay
in
the
borderland
where
no
one
either
affirmed
or
denied
their
individuality
to
quote
the
phrase
of
an
hispanic
american
they
stood
on
the
margin
of
international
life
how
far
they
might
pass
beyond
it
into
the
full
privileges
of
recognition
and
association
on
equal
terms
would
depend
upon
the
readiness
with
which
they
could
atone
for
the
errors
or
recover
from
the
misfortunes
of
the
past
and
upon
their
power
to
attain
stability
prosperity
strength
and
responsibility
certain
of
the
hispanic
republics
however
were
not
allowed
to
remain
alone
on
their
side
of
the
margin
of
international
life
though
nothing
so
extreme
as
the
earlier
french
intervention
took
place
foreign
nations
were
not
at
all
averse
to
crossing
over
the
marginal
line
and
teaching
them
what
a
failure
to
comply
with
international
obligations
meant
the
period
from
to
therefore
is
characterized
also
by
interference
on
the
part
of
european
powers
and
by
interposition
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
in
the
affairs
of
countries
in
and
around
the
caribbean
sea
because
of
the
action
taken
by
the
united
states
two
more
republics
cuba
and
panama
came
into
being
thus
increasing
the
number
of
political
offshoots
from
spain
in
america
to
eighteen
another
result
of
this
interposition
was
the
creation
of
what
were
substantially
american
protectorates
here
the
united
states
did
not
deprive
the
countries
concerned
of
their
independence
and
sovereignty
but
subjected
them
to
a
kind
of
guardianship
or
tutelage
so
far
as
it
thought
needful
to
insure
stability
solvency
health
and
welfare
in
general
foremost
in
the
northern
group
of
hispanic
nations

under
the
guidance
of

steadily
onward
peace

and
law
an
increasing
population
internal
wealth
and
a
flourishing
industry
and
commerce
suitable
care
for
things
mental
as
well
as
material
the
respect
and
confidence
of
foreigners
these
were
blessings
which
the
country
had
hitherto
never
beheld
the
mexicans
once
in
anarchy
and
enmity
created
by
militarists
and
clericals
came
to
know
one
another
in
friendship
and
arrived
at
something
like
a
national
consciousness
in
there
was
held
the
first
conference
on
educational
problems
which
the
republic
had
ever
had
three
years
later
a
mining
code
was
drawn
up
which
made
ownership
inviolable
on
payment
of
lawful
dues
removed
uncertainties
of
operation
and
stimulated
the
industry
in
a
remarkable
fashion
far
less
beneficial
in
the
long
run
was
a
law
enacted
in
instead
of
granting
a
legal
title
to
lands
held
by
prescriptive
rights
through
an
occupation
of
many
years
it
made
such
property
part
of
the
public
domain
which
might
be
acquired
like
a
mining
claim
by
any
one
who
could
secure
a
grant
of
it
from
the
government
though
hailed
at
the
time
as
a
piece
of
constructive
legislation
its
unfortunate
effect
was
to
enable
large
landowners
who
wished
to
increase
their
possessions
to
oust
poor
cultivators
of
the
soil
from
their
humble
holdings
on
the
other
hand
under
the
statesmanlike
management
of
jose
yves
limantour
the
minister
of
finance
the
monetary
situation
at
home
and
abroad
was
strengthened
beyond
measure
and
banking
interests
were
promoted
accordingly
further
an
act
abolishing
the
alcabala
a
vexatious
internal
revenue
tax
gave
a
great
stimulus
to
freedom
of
commerce
throughout
the
country
in
order
to
insure
a
continuance
of
the
new
regime
the
constitution
was
altered
in
three
important
respects
the
amendment
of
restored
the
original
clause
of
which
permitted
indefinite
reelection
to
the
presidency
that
of
established
a
presidential
succession
in
case
of
a
vacancy
beginning
with
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
and
that
of
lengthened
the
term
of
the
chief
magistrate
from
four
years
to
six
and
created
the
office
of
vice
president
in
central
america
two
republics
guatemala
and
costa
rica
set
an
excellent
example
both
because
they
were
free
from
internal
commotions
and
because
they
refrained
from
interference
in
the
affairs
of
their
neighbors
the
contrast
between
these
two
quiet
little
nations
under
their
lawyer
presidents
and
the
bellicose
but
equally
small
nicaragua
honduras
and
salvador
under
their
chieftains
military
and
juristic
was
quite
remarkable
nevertheless
another
attempt
at
confederation
was
made
in
the
ruler
of
honduras
declaring
that
reunion
was
a
primordial
necessity
invited
his
fellow
potentates
of
nicaragua
and
salvador
to
unite
in
creating
the
greater
republic
of
central
america
and
asked
guatemala
and
costa
rica
to
join
delegates
actually
appeared
from
all
five
republics
attended
fiestas
gave
expression
to
pious
wishes
and
went
home
later
still
in
the
respective
presidents
signed
a
convention
of
peace
and
obligatory
arbitration
as
a
means
of
adjusting
perpetual
disagreements
about
politics
and
boundaries
but
nothing
was
done
to
carry
these
ideas
into
effect
the
personage
mainly
responsible
for
these
failures
was
jose
santos
zelaya
one
of
the
most
arrant
military
lordlets
and
meddlers
that
central
america
had
produced
in
a
long
time
since
he
had
been
dictator
of
nicaragua
a
country
not
only
entangled
in
continuous
wrangles
among
its
towns
and
factions
but
bowed
under
an
enormous
burden
of
debt
created
by
excessive
emissions
of
paper
money
and
by
the
contraction
of
more
or
less
scandalous
foreign
loans
quite
undisturbed
by
the
financial
situation
zelaya
promptly
silenced
local
bickerings
and
devoted
his
energies
to
altering
the
constitution
for
his
presidential
benefit
and
to
making
trouble
for
his
neighbors
nor
did
he
refrain
from
displays
of
arbitrary
conduct
that
were
sure
to
provoke
foreign
intervention
great
britain
for
example
on
two
occasions
exacted
reparation
at
the
cannon
mouth
for
ill
treatment
of
its
citizens
zelaya
waxed
wroth
at
the
spectacle
of
guatemala
once
so
active
in
revolutionary
arts
but
now
quietly
minding
its
own
business
in
therefore
along
with
parties
of
hondurans
salvadoreans
and
disaffected
guatemalans
he
began
an
invasion
of
that
country
and
continued
operations
with
decreasing
success
until
the
united
states
and
mexico
offering
their
mediation
peace
was
signed
aboard
an
american
cruiser
then
when
costa
rica
invited
the
other
republics
to
discuss
confederation
within
its
calm
frontiers
zelaya
preferred
his
own
particular
occupation
to
any
such
procedure
accordingly
displeased
with
a
recent
boundary
decision
he
started
along
with
salvador
to
fight
honduras
once
more
the
united
states
and
mexico
tendered
their
good
offices
and
again
a
central
american
conflict
was
closed
aboard
an
american
warship
about
the
only
real
achievement
of
zelaya
was
the
signing
of
a
treaty
by
which
great
britain
recognized
the
complete
sovereignty
of
nicaragua
over
the
mosquito
indians
whose
buzzing
for
a
larger
amount
of
freedom
and
more
tribute
had
been
disturbing
unduly
the
repose
of
that
small
nation
to
the
eastward
the
new
republic
of
cuba
was
about
to
be
born
here
a
promise
of
adequate
representation
in
the
spanish
cortes
and
of
a
local
legislature
had
failed
to
satisfy
the
aspirations
of
many
of
its
inhabitants
the
discontent
was
aggravated
by
lax
and
corrupt
methods
of
administration
as
well
as
by
financial
difficulties
swarms
of
spanish
officials
enjoyed
large
salaries
without
performing
duties
of
equivalent
value
not
a
few
of
them
had
come
over
to
enrich
themselves
at
public
expense
and
under
conditions
altogether
scandalous
on
cuba
furthermore
was
saddled
the
debt
incurred
by
the
ten
years
war
while
the
island
continued
to
be
a
lucrative
market
for
spanish
goods
without
obtaining
from
spain
a
corresponding
advantage
for
its
own
products
as
the
insistence
upon
a
removal
of
these
abuses
and
upon
a
grant
of
genuine
became
steadily
more
clamorous
three
political
groups
appeared
the
constitutional
unionists
or
austrianizers
as
they
were
dubbed
because
of
their
avowed
loyalty
to
the
royal
house
of
were
made
up
of
the
spanish
and
conservative
elements
and
represented
the
large
economic
interests
and
the
church
the
liberals
or
autonomists
desired
such
reforms
in
the
administration
as
would
assure
the
exercise
of
and
yet
preserve
the
bond
with
the
mother
country
on
the
other
hand
the
radicals
or
nationalists
the
party
of
cuba
free
would
be
satisfied
with
nothing
short
of
absolute
independence
all
these
differences
of
opinion
were
sharpened
by
the
activities
of
a
sensational
press
from
about
onward
the
movement
toward
independence
gathered
tremendous
strength
especially
when
the
cubans
found
popular
sentiment
in
the
united
states
so
favorable
to
it
excitement
rose
still
higher
when
the
spanish
government
proposed
to
bestow
a
larger
measure
of
autonomy
when
however
the
cortes
decided
upon
less
liberal
arrangements
the
autonomists
declared
that
they
had
been
deceived
and
the
nationalists
denounced
the
utter
unreliability
of
spanish
promises
even
if
the
concessions
had
been
generous
the
result
probably
would
have
been
the
same
for
by
this
time
the
plot
to
set
cuba
free
had
become
so
widespread
both
in
the
island
itself
and
among
the
refugees
in
the
united
states
that
the
inevitable
struggle
could
not
have
been
deferred
in
the
revolution
broke
out
the
whites
headed
by
maximo
gomez
and
the
negroes
and
mulattoes
by
their
chieftain
antonio
maceo
both
of
whom
had
done
valiant
service
in
the
earlier
war
started
upon
a
campaign
of
deliberate
terrorism
this
time
they
were
resolved
to
win
at
any
cost
spurning
every
offer
of
conciliation
they
burned
ravaged
and
laid
waste
spread
desolation
along
their
pathway
and
reduced
thousands
to
abject
poverty
and
want
then
the
spanish
government
came
to
the
conclusion
that
nothing
but
the
most
rigorous
sort
of
reprisals
would
check
the
excesses
of
the
rebels
in
it
commissioned
valeriano
weyler
an
officer
who
personified
ferocity
to
put
down
the
rebellion
if
the
insurgents
had
fancied
that
the
conciliatory
spirit
hitherto
displayed
by
the
spaniards
was
due
to
irresolution
or
weakness
they
found
that
these
were
not
the
qualities
of
their
new
opponent
weyler
instead
of
trying
to
suppress
the
rebellion
by
hurrying
detachments
of
troops
first
to
one
spot
and
then
to
another

to

planted
his
army

prohibited
the

there

ordered
the

to
assemble
in
camps
which
they
were
not
permitted
to
leave
on
any
pretext

this
was

policy

deficient

sanitary
precautions
and
absence
of
moral
safeguards
made
conditions
of

in
these
camps
appalling
death
was
a
welcome
relief
reconcentration
combined
with
executions
and
deportations
could
have
but
one
result
the
pacification
of
cuba
by
converting
it
into
a
desert
not
in
the
united
states
alone
but
in
spain
itself
the
story
of
these
drastic
measures
kindled
popular
indignation
to
such
an
extent
that
in
the
government
was
forced
to
recall
the
ferocious
weyler
and
to
send
over
a
new
governor
and
captain
general
with
instructions
to
abandon
the
worst
features
of
his
predecessor
policy
and
to
establish
a
complete
system
of
autonomy
in
both
cuba
and
porto
rico
feeling
assured
however
that
an
ally
was
at
hand
who
would
soon
make
their
independence
certain
the
cuban
patriots
flatly
rejected
these
overtures
in
their
expectations
they
were
not
mistaken
by
its
armed
intervention
in
the
following
year
the
united
states
acquired
porto

for
itself

guardian

not
only
was
cuba
placed
under

it
had
to
insert
in
the
constitution
of
certain
clauses
that
could
not

to
be
galling

cuban

were
of
special
significance

affairs

cubans

would
seem
had
exchanged
a
dependence
on
spain
for
a
restricted
independence

by
the
will
of

country

stronger

life
as

provided
tomas
estrada

the
first
president
and
long
the
head
of
the
cuban
junta
in
the
united
states
showed
himself
disposed
from
the
outset
to
continue
the
beneficial
reforms

which
had

introduced

rule

tried
to
dispel
as

he
could
the
bitter
recollections

in
this
policy
he
was
upheld
by
the
conservative
class
or
moderates
their
opponents
the
liberals
dominated
by
men
of
radical
tendencies
were
eager
to
assert
the
right
to
which
they
thought
cuba
entitled
as
an
independent
sovereign
nation
to
make
possible
mistakes
and
correct
them
without
having
the
united
states
forever
holding
the
ferule
of
the
schoolmaster
over
it
they
were
well
aware
however
that
they
were
not
at
liberty
to
have
their
country
pass
through
the
tempestuous
experience
which
had
been
the
lot
of
so
many
hispanic
republics
they
could
vent
a
natural
anger
and
disappointment
nevertheless
on
the
president
and
his
supporters
rather
than
continue
to
be
governed
by
cubans
not
to
their
liking
they
were
willing
to
bring
about
a
renewal
of
american
rule
in
this
respect
the
wishes
of
the
radicals
were
soon
gratified
hardly
had
estrada

in
assumed
office
for
a
second
time
when
parties
of
malcontents
declaring
that
he
had
secured
his
reelection
by
fraudulent
means
rose
up
in
arms
and
demanded
that
he
annul
the
vote
and
hold
a
fair
election
the
president
accepted
the
challenge
and
waged
a
futile
conflict
and
again
the
united
states
intervened
upon
the
resignation
of
estrada
palma
an
american
governor
was
again
installed
and
cuba
was
told
in
unmistakable
fashion
that
the
next
intervention
might
be
permanent
less
drastic
but
quite
as
effectual
a
method
of
assuring
order
and
regularity
in
administration

the
action
taken
by
the
united

in
another
caribbean
island

little
country
like
the
dominican
republic
in
which
few
presidents
managed
to
retain
their
offices
for
terms
fixed
by
changeable
constitutions
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
rid
itself
of
a
ruler
who
had
held
power
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
after
he
had
been
disposed

of
his
successor
undertook
to
repudiate
a
depreciated
paper
currency
by
ordering
the
customs

it
also

fixed
in
the
fundamental
law
itself
but
the
educational
tests
imposed
excluded
the
great
bulk
of
the
population
from
the
right
to
vote
in
the
constitution
also
church
and
state
were
declared
absolutely
separate
and
civil
marriage
was
prescribed
well
adapted
as
the
constitution
was
to
the
particular
needs
of
brazil
the
government
erected
under
it
had
to
contend
awhile
with
political
disturbances
though
conflicts
occurred
between
the
president
and
the
congress
between
the
federal
authority
and
the
states
and
between
the
civil
administration
and
naval
and
military
officials
none
were
so
constant
so
prolonged
or
so
disastrous
as
in
the
spanish
american
republics
even
when
elected
by
the
connivance
of
government
officials
the
chief
magistrate
governed
in
accordance
with
republican
forms
presidential
power
in
fact
was
restrained
both
by
the
huge
size
of
the
country
and
by
the
spirit
of
local
autonomy
upheld
by
the
states
ever
since
the
war
with
paraguay
the
financial
credit
of
brazil
had
been
impaired
the
chronic
deficit
in
the
treasury
had
been
further
increased
by
a
serious
lowering
in
the
rate
of
exchange
which
was
due
to
an
excessive
issue
of
paper
money
in
order
to
save
the
nation
from
bankruptcy
manoel
ferraz
de
campos
salles
a
distinguished
jurist
was
commissioned
to
effect
an
adjustment
with
the
british
creditors
as
a
result
of
his
negotiations
a
funding
loan
was
obtained
in
return
for
which
an
equivalent
amount
in
paper
money
was
to
be
turned
over
for
cancellation
at
a
fixed
rate
of
exchange
under
this
arrangement
depreciation
ceased
for
awhile
and
the
financial
outlook
became
brighter
the
election
of
campos
salles
to
the
presidency
in
as
a
reward
for
his
success
was
accompanied
by
the
rise
of
definite
political
parties
among
them
the
radicals
or
progressists
favored
a
policy
of
centralization
under
military
auspices
and
exhibited
certain
antiforeign
tendencies
the
moderates
or
republicans
on
the
contrary
with
campos
salles
as
their
candidate
declared
for
the
existing
constitution
and
advocated
a
gradual
adoption
of
such
reforms
as
reason
and
time
might
suggest
when
the
latter
party
won
the
election
confidence
in
the
stability
of
brazil
returned
as
if
uruguay
had
not
already
suffered
enough
from
internal
discords
two
more
serious
conflicts
demonstrated
once
again
that
this
little
country
in
which
political
power
had
been
held
substantially
by
one
party
alone
since
could
not
hope
for
permanent
peace
until
either
the
excluded
and
apparently
irreconcilable
party
had
been
finally
and
utterly
crushed
or
far
better
still
until
the
two
factions
could
manage
to
agree
upon
some
satisfactory
arrangement
for
rotation
in
office
the
struggle
of
ended
in
the
assassination
of
the
president
and
in
a
division
of
the
republic
into
two
practically
separate
areas
one
ruled
by
the
colorados
at
montevideo
the
other
by
the
blancos
a
renewal
of
civil
war
in
seemed
altogether
preferable
to
an
indefinite
continuance
of
this
dualism
in
government
even
at
the
risk
of
friction
with
argentina
which
was
charged
with
not
having
observed
strict
neutrality
this
second
struggle
came
to
a
close
with
the
death
of
the
insurgent
leader
but
it
cost
the
lives
of
thousands
and
did
irreparable
damage
to
the
commerce
and
industry
of
the
country
uruguay
then
enjoyed
a
respite
from
party
upheavals
until
when
jose
batlle
the
able
resolute
and
head
of
the
colorados
announced
that
he
would
be
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
as
he
had
held
the
office
before
and
had
never
ceased
to
wield
a
strong
personal
influence
over
the
administration
of
his
successor
the
blancos
decided
that
now
was
the
time
to
attempt
once
more
to
oust
their
opponents
from
the
control
which
they
had
monopolized
for
half
a
century
accusing
the
government
of
an
unconstitutional
centralization
of
power
in
the
executive
of
preventing
free
elections
and
of
crippling
the
pastoral
industries
of
the
country
they
started
a
revolt
which
ran
a
brief
course
batlle
proved
himself
equal
to
the
situation
and
quickly
suppressed
the
insurrection
though
he
did
make
a
wide
use
of
his
authority
the
president
refrained
from
indulging
in
political
persecution
and
allowed
the
press
all
the
liberty
it
desired
in
so
far
as
was
consistent
with
the
law
it
was
under
his
direction
that
uruguay
entered
upon
a
remarkable
series
of
experiments
in
the
nationalization
of
business
enterprises
further
more
or
less
at
the
suggestion
of
battle
a
new
constitution
was
ratified
by
popular
vote
in
it
provided
for
a
division
of
the
executive
power
between
the
president
and
a
national
council
of
administration
forbade
the
election
of
administrative
and
military
officials
to
the
congress
granted
to
that
body
a
considerable
increase
of
power
and
enlarged
the
facilities
for
local
in
addition
it
established
the
principle
of
minority
representation
and
of
secrecy
of
the
ballot
permitted
the
congress
to
extend
the
right
of
suffrage
to
women
and
dissolved
the
union
between
church
and
state
if
the
terms
of
the
new
instrument
are
faithfully
observed
the
old
struggle
between
blancos
and
colorados
will
have
been
brought
definitely
to
a
close
paraguay
lapsed
after
into
the
earlier
sins
of
spanish
america
upon
a
comparatively
placid
presidential
regime
followed
a
series
of
barrack
uprisings
or
attacks
by
congress
on
the
executive
the
constitution
became
a
farce
no
longer
to
be
sure
an
abode
of
arcadian
seclusion
as
in
colonial
times
or
a
sort
of
territorial
cobweb
from
the
center
of
which
a
spiderlike
francia
hung
motionless
or
darted
upon
his
hapless
prey

fanatical
warriors

lopez
paraguay
now
took
on
the
aspect
of
an
arena
in
which
petty
political
gamecocks
might
try
out
their
spurs
happily
the
opposing
parties
spent
their
energies
in
high
words
and
vehement
gestures
rather
than
in
blows
and
bloodshed
the
credit
of
the
country
sank
lower
and
lower
until
its
paper
money
stood
at
a
discount
of
several
hundred
per
cent
compared
with
gold
european
bankers
had
begun
to
view
the
financial
future
of
argentina
also
with
great
alarm
in
the
mad
careering
of
private
speculation
and
public
expenditure
along
the
roseate
pathway
of
limitless
credit
reached
a
veritable
crisis
of
progress
a
frightful
panic
ensued
paper
money
fell
to
less
than
a
quarter
of
its
former
value
in
gold
many
a
firm
became
bankrupt
and
many
a
fortune
shriveled
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
the
government
had
to
shoulder
the
blame
a
revolution
broke
out
in
buenos
aires
and
the
president
became
the
scapegoat
but
the
panic
went
on
nevertheless
until
gold
stood
at
nearly
five
to
one
most
of
the
banks
suspended
payment
the
national
debt
underwent
a
huge
increase
and
immigration
practically
ceased
by
however
the
country
had
more
or
less
resumed
its
normal
condition
a
new
census
showed
that
the
population
had
risen
to
four
million
about
a
sixth
of
whom
resided
in
the
capital
the
importance
which
agriculture
had
attained
was
attested
by
the
establishment
of
a
separate
ministry
in
the
presidential
cabinet
industry
too
made
such
rapid
strides
at
this
time
that
organized
labor
began
to
take
a
hand
in
politics
the
revolution
of
for
example
was
not
primarily
the
work
of
politicians
but
of
strikers
organized
into
a
workingmen
federation
for
three
months
civil
guarantees
were
suspended
and
by
a
law
of
residence
enacted
some
years
before
and
now
put
into
effect
the
government
was
authorized
to
expel
summarily
any
foreigner
guilty
of
fomenting
strikes
or
of
disturbing
public
order
in
any
other
fashion
political
agitation
soon
assumed
a
new
form
since
the
party
had
been
in
control
for
thirty
years
or
more
it
seemed
to
the
now
known
as
republicans
to
the
autonomists
proper
and
to
various
other
factions
that
they
ought
to
do
something
to
break
the
hold
of
that
powerful
organization
accordingly
in
the
president
supported
by
a
coalition
of
these
factions
started
what
was
termed
an
revolution
in
other
words
a
series
of
interventions
by
which
local
governors
and
members
of
legislatures
suspected
of
leanings
were
to
be
replaced
by
individuals
who
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
the
administration
pretexts
for
such
action
were
not
hard
to
find
under
the
terms
of
the
constitution
but
their
political
interests
suffered
so
much
in
the
effort
that
the
promoters
had
to
abandon
it
owing
to
persistent
obstruction
on
the
part
of
congress
which
took
the
form
of
a
refusal
either
to
sanction
his
appointments
or
to
approve
the
budget
the
president
suspended
the
sessions
of
that
body
in
and
decreed
a
continuance
of
the
estimates
for
the
preceding
year
the
antagonism
between
the
chief
executive
and
the
legislature
became
so
violent
that
if
his
opponents
had
not
been
split
up
into
factions
civil
war
might
have
ensued
in
argentina
to
remedy
a
situation
made
worse
by
the
absence
usual
in
most
of
the
hispanic
republics
of
a
secret
ballot
and
by
the
refusal
of
political
malcontents
to
take
part
in
elections
voting
was
made
both
obligatory
and
secret
in
and
the
principle
of
minority
representation
was
introduced
legislation
of
this
sort
was
designed
to
check
bribery
and
intimidation
and
to
enable
the
to
do
their
duty
at
the
polls
its
effect
was
shown
five
years
later
when
the
secret
ballot
was
used
substantially
for
the
first
time
the
radicals
won
both
the
presidency
and
a
majority
in
the
congress
one
of
the
secrets
of
the
prosperity
of
argentina
as
of
brazil
in
recent
years
has
been
its
abstention
from
warlike
ventures
beyond
its
borders
and
its
endeavor
to
adjust
boundary
conflicts
by
arbitration
even
when
its
attitude
toward
its
huge
neighbor
had
become
embittered
in
consequence
of
a
boundary
decision
rendered
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
it
abated
none
of
its
enthusiasm
for
the
principle
of
a
peaceful
settlement
of
international
disputes
four
years
later
in
a
treaty
with
uruguay
the
argentine
formula
appeared
to
quote
its
language
the
contracting
parties
agree
to
submit
to
arbitration
all
questions
of
any
nature
which
may
arise
between
them
provided
they
do
not
affect
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
either
state
and
can
not
be
adjusted
by
direct
negotiation
this
formula
was
soon
put
to
the
test
in
a
serious
dispute
with
chile
in
the
treaty
of
in
partitioning
patagonia
the
crest
of
the
andes
had
been
assumed
to
be
the
true
continental
watershed
between
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
and
hence
was
made
the
boundary
line
between
argentina
and
chile
the
entire
atlantic
coast
was
to
belong
to
argentina
the
pacific
coast
to
chile
the
island
of
tierra
del
fuego
was
to
be
divided
between
them
at
the
same
time
the
strait
of
magellan
was
declared
a
neutral
waterway
open
to
the
ships
of
all
nations
ere
long
however
it
was
ascertained
that
the
crest
of
the
andes
did
not
actually
coincide
with
the
continental
divide
thereupon
argentina
insisted
that
the
boundary
line
should
be
made
to
run
along
the
crest
while
chile
demanded
that
it
be
traced
along
the
watershed
since
the
mountainous
area
concerned
was
of
little
value
the
question
at
bottom
was
simply
one
of
power
and
prestige
between
rival
states
as
the
dispute
waxed
warmer
a
noisy
press
and
populace
clamored
for
war
the
governments
of
the
two
nations
spent
large
sums
in
increasing
their
armaments
and
argentina
in
imitation
of
its
western
neighbor
made
military
service
compulsory
but
as
the
conviction
gradually
spread
that
a
struggle
would
leave
the
victor
as
prostrate
as
the
vanquished
wiser
counsels
prevailed
in
accordingly
the
matter
was
referred
to
the
king
of
great
britain
for
decision
though
the
award
was
a
compromise
chile
was
the
actual
gainer
in
territory
by
their
treaties
of
both
republics
declared
their
intention
to
uphold
the
principle
of
arbitration
and
to
refrain
from
interfering
in
each
other
affairs
along
their
respective
coasts
they
also
agreed
upon
a
limitation
of
armaments
the
sole
example
on
record
of
a
realization
of
the
purpose
of
the
first
hague
conference
to
commemorate
still
further
their
international
accord
in
they
erected
on
the
summit
of
the
uspallata
pass
over
which
san
martin
had
crossed
with
his
army
of
liberation
in
a
bronze
statue
of
christ
the
redeemer
there
amid
the
peaks
of
the
giant
andes
one
may
read
inscribed
upon
the
pedestal
sooner
shall
these
mountains
crumble
to
dust
than
argentinos
and
chileans
break
the
peace
which
at
the
feet
of
christ
the
redeemer
they
have
sworn
to
maintain
nor
has
the
peace
been
broken
though
hostilities
with
argentina
had
thus
been
averted
chile
had
experienced
within
its
own
frontiers
the
most
serious
revolution
it
had
known
in
sixty
years
the
struggle
was
not
one
of
partisan
chieftains
or
political
groups
but
a
genuine
contest
to
determine
which
of
two
theories
of
government
should
prevail
the
presidential
or
the
parliamentary
a
presidential
autocracy
with
the
spread
of
real
democracy
or
a
congressional
oligarchy
based
on
the
existing
order
the
sincerity
and
public
spirit
of
both
contestants
helped
to
lend
dignity
to
the
conflict
jose
manuel
balmaceda
a
man
of
marked
ability
who
became
president
in
had
devoted
much
of
his
political
life
to
urging
an
enlargement
of
the
executive
power
a
greater
freedom
to
municipalities
in
the
management
of
their
local
affairs
and
a
broadening
of
the
suffrage
he
had
even
advocated
a
separation
of
church
and
state
most
of
these
proposals
so
conservative
a
land
as
chile
was
not
prepared
to
accept
though
civil
marriage
was
authorized
and
ecclesiastical
influence
was
lessened
in
other
respects
the
church
stood
firm
during
his
administration
balmaceda
introduced
many
reforms
both
material
and
educational
he
gave
a
great
impetus
to
the
construction
of
public
works
enhanced
the
national
credit
by
a
favorable
conversion
of
the
public
debt
fostered
immigration
and
devoted
especial
attention
to
the
establishment
of
secondary
schools
excellent
as
the
administration
of
balmaceda
had
been
in
other
respects
he
nevertheless
failed
to
combine
the
liberal
factions
into
a
party
willing
to
support
the
plans
of
reform
which
he
had
steadily
favored
the
parliamentary
system
made
cabinets
altogether
unstable
as
political
groups
in
the
lower
house
of
the
congress
alternately
cohered
and
fell
apart
this
defect
balmaceda
thought
should
be
corrected
by
making
the
members
of
his
official
family
independent
of
the
legislative
branch
the
council
of
state
a
somewhat
anomalous
body
placed
between
the
president
and
cabinet
on
the
one
side
and
the
congress
on
the
other
was
an
additional
obstruction
to
a
administration
for
it
he
would
substitute
a
tribunal
charged
with
the
duty
of
resolving
conflicts
between
the
two
chief
branches
of
government
balmaceda
believed
also
that
greater
liberty
should
be
given
to
the
press
and
that
existing
taxes
should
be
altered
as
rarely
as
possible
on
its
side
the
congress
felt
that
the
president
was
trying
to
establish
a
dictatorship
and
to
replace
the
unitary
system
by
a
federal
union
the
probable
weakness
of
which
would
enable
him
to
retain
his
power
more
securely
toward
the
close
of
his
term
in
january
when
the
liberals
declined
to
support
his
candidate
for
the
presidency
balmaceda
furious
at
the
opposition
which
he
had
encountered
took
matters
into
his
own
hands
since
the
congress
refused
to
pass
the
appropriation
bills
he
declared
that
body
dissolved
and
proceeded
to
levy
the
taxes
by
decree
to
this
arbitrary
and
altogether
unconstitutional
performance
the
congress
retorted
by
declaring
the
president
deposed
civil
war
broke
out
forthwith
and
a
strange
spectacle
presented
itself
the
two
chief
cities
santiago
and
valparaiso
and
most
of
the
army
backed
balmaceda
whereas
the
country
districts
especially
in
the
north
and
practically
all
the
navy
upheld
the
congress
these
were
indeed
dark
days
for
chile
during
a
struggle
of
about
eight
months
the
nation
suffered
more
than
it
had
done
in
years
of
warfare
with
peru
and
bolivia
though
the
bulk
of
the
army
stood
by
balmaceda
the
congress
was
able
to
raise
and
organize
a
much
stronger
fighting
force
under
a
prussian
drillmaster
the
tide
of
battle
turned
santiago
and
valparaiso
capitulated
and
the
presidential
cause
was
lost
balmaceda
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
argentina
legation
committed
suicide
but
the
balmacedists
who
were
included
in
a
general
amnesty
still
maintained
themselves
as
a
party
to
advocate
in
a
peaceful
fashion
the
principles
of
their
fallen
leader
chile
had
its
reputation
for
stability
well
tested
in
when
the
executive
changed
four
times
without
the
slightest
political
disturbance
according
to
the
constitution
the
officer
who
takes
the
place
of
the
president
in
case
of
the
latter
death
or
disability
though
vested
with
full
authority
has
the
title
of
vice
president
only
it
so
happened
that
after
the
death
of
the
president
two
members
of
the
cabinet
in
succession
held
the
vice
presidency
and
they
were
followed
by
the
chief
magistrate
who
was
duly
elected
and
installed
at
the
close
of
the
year
in
for
the
first
time
since
their
leader
had
committed
suicide
one
of
the
followers
of
balmaceda
was
chosen
president
by
a
strange
coalition
of
or
balmacedists
conservatives
and
nationalists
over
the
candidate
of
the
radicals
liberals
and
democrats
the
maintenance
of
the
parliamentary
system
however
continued
to
produce
frequent
alterations
in
the
personnel
of
the
cabinet
in
its
foreign
relations
apart
from
the
adjustment
reached
with
argentina
chile
managed
to
settle
the
difficulties
with
bolivia
arising
out
of
the
war
of
the
pacific
by
the
terms
of
treaties
concluded
in
and
the
region
tentatively
transferred
by
the
armistice
of
was
ceded
outright
to
chile
in
return
for
a
seaport
and
a
narrow
right
of
way
to
it
through
the
former
peruvian
province
of
tarapaca
with
peru
chile
was
not
so
fortunate
though
the
tension
over
the
ultimate
disposal
of
the
tacna
and
arica
question
was
somewhat
reduced
it
was
far
from
being
removed
chile
absolutely
refused
to
submit
the
matter
to
arbitration
on
the
ground
that
such
a
procedure
could
not
properly
be
applied
to
a
question
arising
out
of
a
war
that
had
taken
place
so
many
years
before
chile
did
not
wish
to
give
the
region
up
lest
by
so
doing
it
might
expose
tarapaca
to
a
possible
attack
from
peru
the
investment
of
large
amounts
of
foreign
capital
in
the
exploitation
of
the
deposits
of
nitrate
of
soda
had
made
that
province
economically
very
valuable
and
the
export
tax
levied
on
the
product
was
the
chief
source
of
the
national
revenue
these
were
all
potent
reasons
why
chile
wanted
to
keep
its
hold
on
tacna
and
arica
besides
possession
was
nine
points
in
the
law
on
the
other
hand
the
original
plan
of
having
the
question
decided
by
a
vote
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
provinces
concerned
was
not
carried
into
effect
partly
because
both
claimants
cherished
a
conviction
that
whichever
lost
the
election
would
deny
its
validity
and
partly
because
they
could
not
agree
upon
the
precise
method
of
holding
it
chile
suggested
that
the
international
commission
which
was
selected
to
take
charge
of
the
plebiscite
and
which
was
composed
of
a
chilean
a
peruvian
and
a
neutral
should
be
presided
over
by
the
chilean
member
as
representative
of
the
country
actually
in
possession
whereas
peru
insisted
that
the
neutral
should
act
as
chairman
chile
proposed
also
that
chileans
peruvians
and
foreigners
resident
in
the
area
six
months
before
the
date
of
the
elections
should
vote
provided
that
they
had
the
right
to
do
so
under
the
terms
of
the
constitutions
of
both
states
peru
on
its
part
objected
to
the
length
of
residence
and
wished
to
limit
carefully
the
number
of
chilean
voters
to
exclude
foreigners
altogether
from
the
election
and
to
disregard
qualifications
for
the
suffrage
which
required
an
ability
to
read
and
write
both
countries
moreover
appeared
to
have
a
lurking
suspicion
that
in
any
event
the
other
would
try
to
secure
a
majority
at
the
polls
by
supplying
a
requisite
number
of
voters
drawn
from
their
respective
citizenry
who
were
not
ordinarily
resident
in
tacna
and
arica
unable
to
overcome
the
deadlock
chile
and
peru
agreed
in
to
postpone
the
settlement
for
twenty
years
longer
at
the
expiration
of
this
period
when
chile
would
have
held
the
provinces
for
half
a
century
the
question
should
be
finally
adjusted
on
bases
mutually
satisfactory
officially
amicable
relations
were
then
restored
while
the
political
situation
in
bolivia
remained
stable
so
much
could
not
be
said
of
that
in
peru
and
ecuador
if
the
troubles
in
the
former
were
more
or
less
military
a
persistence
of
the
conflict
between
clericals
and
radicals
characterized
the
commotions
in
the
latter
because
of
certain
liberal
provisions
in
the
constitution
of
peru
on
the
other
hand
in
guaranteed
its
people
the
enjoyment
of
religious
liberty
next
to
the
tacna
and
arica
question
the
dubious
boundaries
of
ecuador
constituted
the
most
serious
international
problem
in
south
america
the
oriente
region
lying
east
of
the
andes
and
claimed
by
peru
brazil
and
colombia
appeared
differently
on
different
maps
according
as
one
claimant
nation
or
another
set
forth
its
own
case
had
all
three
been
satisfied
nothing
would
have
been
left
of
ecuador
but
the
strip
between
the
andes
and
the
pacific
coast
including
the
cities
of
quito
and
guayaquil
the
ecuadorians
therefore
were
bitterly
sensitive
on
the
subject
protracted
negotiations
over
the
boundaries
became
alike
tedious
and
listless
but
the
moment
that
the
respective
diplomats
had
agreed
upon
some
knotty
point
the
congress
of
one
litigant
or
another
was
almost
sure
to
reject
the
decision
and
start
the
controversy
all
over
again
even
reference
of
the
matter
to
the
arbitral
judgment
of
european
monarchs
produced
so
far
as
ecuador
and
peru
were
concerned
riotous
attacks
upon
the
peruvian
legation
and
consulates
charges
and
countercharges
of
invasion
of
each
other
territory
and
the
suspension
of
diplomatic
relations
though
the
united
states
argentina
and
brazil
had
interposed
to
ward
off
an
armed
conflict
between
the
two
republics
and
in
had
urged
that
the
dispute
be
submitted
to
the
hague
tribunal
nothing
would
induce
ecuador
to
comply
colombia
was
even
more
unfortunate
than
its
southern
neighbor
for
in
addition
to
political
convulsions
it
suffered
financial
disaster
and
an
actual
deprivation
of
territory
struggles
among
factions
official
influence
at
the
elections
dictatorships
and
fighting
between
the
departments
and
the
national
government
plunged
the
country
in
into
the
worst
civil
war
it
had
known
for
many
a
day
paper
money
issued
in
unlimited
amounts
and
given
a
forced
circulation
made
the
distress
still
more
acute
then
came
the
hardest
blow
of
all
since
panama
as
province
or
state
had
tried
many
times
to
secede
from
colombia
in
the
opportunity
it
sought
became
altogether
favorable
the
parent
nation
just
beginning
to
recover
from
the
disasters
of
civil
strife
would
probably
be
unable
to
prevent
a
new
attempt
at
withdrawal
the
people
of
panama
of
course
knew
how
eager
the
united
states
was
to
acquire
the
region
of
the
proposed
canal
zone
since
it
had
failed
to
win
it
by
negotiation
with
colombia
accordingly
if
they
were
to
start
a
revolution
they
had
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
not
lack
support
or
at
least
connivance
from
that
quarter
on
the
of
november
the
projected
revolution
occurred
on
schedule
time
and
the
united
states
recognized
the
independence
of
the
republic
of
panama
three
days
later
in
return
for
a
guarantee
of
independence
however
the
united
states
stipulated
in
the
convention
concluded
on
the
of
november
that
besides
authority
to
enforce
sanitary
regulations
in
the
canal
zone
it
should
also
have
the
right
of
intervention
to
maintain
order
in
the
republic
itself
more
than
once
indeed
after
panama
adopted
its
constitution
in
elections
threatened
to
become
tumultuous
whereupon
the
united
states
saw
to
it
that
they
passed
off
quietly
having
no
wish
to
flout
their
huge
neighbor
to
the
northward
the
hispanic
nations
at
large
hastened
to
acknowledge
the
independence
of
the
new
republic
despite
the
indignation
that
prevailed
in
press
and
public
over
what
was
regarded
as
an
act
of
despoilment
in
view
of
the
resentful
attitude
of
colombia
and
mindful
also
of
the
opinion
of
many
americans
that
a
gross
injustice
had
been
committed
the
united
states
eventually
offered
terms
of
settlement
it
agreed
to
express
regret
for
the
ill
feeling
between
the
two
countries
which
had
arisen
out
of
the
panama
incident
provided
that
such
expression
were
made
mutual
and
as
a
species
of
indemnity
it
agreed
to
pay
for
canal
rights
to
be
acquired
in
colombian
territory
and
for
the
lease
of
certain
islands
as
naval
stations
but
neither
the
terms
nor
the
amount
of
the
compensation
proved
acceptable
instead
colombia
urged
that
the
whole
matter
be
referred
to
the
judgment
of
the
tribunal
at
the
hague
alluding
to
the
use
made
of
the
liberties
won
in
the
struggle
for
emancipation
from
spain
by
the
native
land
of
miranda
bolivar
and
sucre
on
the
part
of
the
country
which
had
been
in
the
vanguard
of
the
fight
for
freedom
from
a
foreign
yoke
a
writer
of
venezuela
once
declared
that
it
had
not
elected
legally
a
single
president
had
not
put
democratic
ideas
or
institutions
into
practice
had
lived
wholly
under
dictatorships
had
neglected
public
instruction
and
had
set
up
a
large
number
of
oppressive
commercial
monopolies
including
the
navigation
of
rivers
the
coastwise
trade
the
pearl
fisheries
and
the
sale
of
tobacco
salt
sugar
liquor
matches
explosives
butter
grease
cement
shoes
meat
and
flour
exaggerated
as
the
indictment
is
and
applicable
also
though
in
less
degree
to
some
of
the
other
backward
countries
of
hispanic
america
it
contains
unfortunately
a
large
measure
of
truth
indeed
so
far
as
venezuela
itself
is
concerned
this
critic
might
have
added
that
every
time
a
restorer
regenerator
or
liberator
succumbed
there
the
old
craze
for
federalism
again
broke
out
and
menaced
the
nation
with
piecemeal
destruction
obedient
furthermore
to
the
whims
of
a
presidential
despot
venezuela
perpetrated
more
outrages
on
foreigners
and
created
more
international
friction
after
than
any
other
land
in
spanish
america
had
ever
done
while
the
formidable
guzman
blanco
was
still
alive
the
various
presidents
acted
cautiously
no
sooner
had
he
passed
away
than
disorder
broke
out
afresh
since
a
new
dictator
thought
he
needed
a
longer
term
of
office
and
divers
other
administrative
advantages
a
constitution
incorporating
them
was
framed
and
published
in
the
due
and
customary
manner
this
had
hardly
gone
into
operation
when
in
a
contest
arose
with
great
britain
about
the
boundaries
between
venezuela
and
british
guiana
under
pressure
from
the
united
states
however
the
matter
was
referred
to
arbitration
and
venezuela
came
out
substantially
the
loser
in
there
appeared
on
the
scene
a
personage
compared
with
whom
zelaya
was
the
merest
novice
in
the
art
of
making
trouble
this
was
cipriano
castro
the
greatest
international
nuisance
of
the
early
twentieth
century
a
rude
arrogant
fearless
energetic
capricious
mountaineer
and
cattleman
he
regarded
foreigners
no
less
than
his
own
countryfolk
it
would
seem
as
objects
for
his
particular
scorn
displeasure
exploitation
or
amusement
as
the
case
might
be
he
was
greatly
angered
by
the
way
in
which
foreigners
in
dispute
with
local
officials
avoided
a
resort
to
venezuelan
courts
and
still
worse
rejected
their
decisions
and
appealed
instead
to
their
diplomatic
representatives
for
protection
he
declared
such
a
procedure
to
be
an
affront
to
the
national
dignity
yet
foreigners
were
usually
correct
in
arming
that
judges
appointed
by
an
arbitrary
president
were
little
more
than
figureheads
incapable
of
dispensing
justice
even
were
they
so
inclined
jealous
not
only
of
his
personal
prestige
but
of
what
he
imagined
or
pretended
to
imagine
were
the
rights
of
a
small
nation
castro
tried
throughout
to
portray
the
situation
in
such
a
light
as
to
induce
the
other
hispanic
republics
also
to
view
foreign
interference
as
a
dire
peril
to
their
own
independence
and
sovereignty
and
he
further
endeavored
to
involve
the
united
states
in
a
struggle
with
european
powers
as
a
means
possibly
of
testing
the
efficacy
of
the
monroe
doctrine
or
of
laying
bare
before
the
world
the
evil
nature
of
american
imperialistic
designs
by
the
year
in
which
venezuela
adopted
another
constitution
the
revolutionary
disturbances
had
materially
diminished
the
revenues
from
the
customs
furthermore
castro
regulations
exacting
military
service
of
all
males
between
fourteen
and
sixty
years
of
age
had
filled
the
prisons
to
overflowing
many
foreigners
who
had
suffered
in
consequence
resorted
to
measures
of
among
them
representatives
of
certain
american
and
british
asphalt
companies
which
were
working
concessions
granted
by
castro
predecessors
though
familiar
with
what
commonly
happens
to
those
who
handle
pitch
they
had
not
scrupled
to
aid
some
of
castro
enemies
castro
forthwith
imposed
on
them
enormous
fines
which
amounted
practically
to
a
confiscation
of
their
rights
while
the
united
states
and
great
britain
were
expostulating
over
this
behavior
of
the
despot
france
broke
off
diplomatic
relations
with
venezuela
because
of
castro
refusal
either
to
pay
or
to
submit
to
arbitration
certain
claims
which
had
originated
in
previous
revolutions
germany
aggrieved
in
similar
fashion
contemplated
a
seizure
of
the
customs
until
its
demands
for
redress
were
satisfied
and
then
came
italy
with
like
causes
of
complaint
as
if
these
complications
were
not
sufficient
venezuela
came
to
blows
with
colombia
as
the
foreign
pressure
on
castro
steadily
increased
luis
maria
drago
the
argentine
minister
of
foreign
affairs
formulated
in
the
doctrine
with
which
his
name
has
been
associated
it
stated
in
substance
that
force
should
never
be
employed
between
nations
for
the
collection
of
contractual
debts
encouraged
by
this
apparent
token
of
support
from
a
sister
republic
castro
defied
his
array
of
foreign
adversaries
more
vigorously
than
ever
declaring
that
he
might
find
it
needful
to
invade
the
united
states
by
way
of
new
orleans
to
teach
it
the
lesson
it
deserved
but
when
he
attempted
in
the
following
year
to
close
the
ports
of
venezuela
as
a
means
of
bringing
his
native
antagonists
to
terms
great
britain
germany
and
italy
seized
his
warships
blockaded
the
coast
and
bombarded
some
of
his
forts
thereupon
the
united
states
interposed
with
a
suggestion
that
the
dispute
be
laid
before
the
hague
tribunal
although
castro
yielded
he
did
not
fail
to
have
a
clause
inserted
in
a
new
constitution
requiring
foreigners
who
might
wish
to
enter
the
republic
to
show
certificates
of
good
character
from
the
governments
of
their
respective
countries
these
incidents
gave
much
food
for
thought
to
castro
as
well
as
to
his
soberer
compatriots
the
european
powers
had
displayed
an
apparent
willingness
to
have
the
united
states
if
it
chose
to
do
so
assume
the
role
of
a
new
world
policeman
and
financial
guarantor
were
it
to
assume
these
duties
backward
republics
in
the
caribbean
and
its
vicinity
were
likely
to
have
their
affairs
internal
as
well
as
external
supervised
by
the
big
nation
in
order
to
ward
off
european
intervention
at
this
moment
indeed
the
united
states
was
intervening
in
panama
the
prospect
aroused
in
many
hispanic
countries
the
fear
of
a
yankee
peril
greater
even
than
that
emanating
from
europe
instead
of
being
a
kindly
and
disinterested
protector
of
small
neighbors
the
colossus
of
the
north
appeared
rather
to
resemble
a
political
and
commercial
ogre
bent
upon
swallowing
them
to
satisfy
manifest
destiny
having
succeeded
in
putting
around
his
head
an
aureole
of
local
popularity
castro
in
picked
a
new
set
of
partially
justified
quarrels
with
the
united
states
great
britain
france
italy
colombia
and
even
with
the
netherlands
arising
out
of
the
depredations
of
revolutionists
but
an
armed
menace
from
the
united
states
induced
him
to
desist
from
his
plans
he
contented
himself
accordingly
with
issuing
a
decree
of
amnesty
for
all
political
offenders
except
the
leaders
when
reelected
he
carried
his
magnanimity
so
far
as
to
resign
awhile
in
favor
of
the
vice
president
stating
that
if
his
retirement
were
to
bring
peace
and
concord
he
would
make
it
permanent
but
as
he
saw
to
it
that
his
temporary
withdrawal
should
not
have
this
happy
result
he
came
back
again
to
his
firmer
position
a
few
months
later
venting
his
wrath
upon
the
netherlands
because
its
minister
had
reported
to
his
government
an
outbreak
of
cholera
at
la
guaira
the
chief
seaport
of
venezuela
the
dictator
laid
an
embargo
on
dutch
commerce
seized
its
ships
and
denounced
the
dutch
for
their
alleged
failure
to
check
filibustering
from
their
islands
off
the
coast
when
the
minister
protested
castro
expelled
him
thereupon
the
netherlands
instituted
a
blockade
of

what
might
have
happened
if
castro
had
remained
much
longer
in
charge
may
be
guessed
toward
the
close
of
however
he
departed
for
europe
to
undergo
a
course
of
medical
treatment
hardly
had
he
left
venezuelan
shores
when
juan
vicente
gomez
the
able
astute
and
vigorous
vice
president
managed
to
secure
his
own
election
to
the
presidency
and
an
immediate
recognition
from
foreign
states
under
his
direction
all
of
the
international
tangles
of
venezuela
were
straightened
out
in
the

its
eleventh
constitution
and
thereby
lengthened
the
presidential
term
to
seven

definitely
the
number
of

in

altered
the
apportionment
of
their
congressional
representation
and
enlarged
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
or
rather
those
of
its
executive
branch
in
gomez
resigned
office
in
favor
of
the
vice
president
and
secured
an
appointment
instead
as
commander
in
chief
of
the
army
this
procedure
was
promptly
denounced
as
a
trick
to
evade
the
constitutional
prohibition
of
two
consecutive
terms
a
year
later
he
was
unanimously
elected
president
though
he
never
formally
took
the
oath
of
office

may
be
thought
of
the
political
ways
and
means
of
this
new
guzmin
blanco
to
maintain
himself
as
a
power
behind
or
on
the
presidential
throne
gomez
gave
venezuela
an
administration
of
a
sort
very
different
from
that
of
his
immediate
predecessor
he
suppressed
various
government
monopolies
removed
other
obstacles
to
the
material
advancement
of
the
country
and
reduced
the
national
debt
he
did
much
also
to
improve
the
sanitary
conditions
at
la
guaira
and
he
promoted
education
especially
the
teaching
of
foreign
languages
gomez
nevertheless
had
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
the
partisans
of
castro
who
broke
out
in
revolt
whenever
they
had
an
opportunity
the
united
states
great
britain
france
the
netherlands
denmark
cuba
and
colombia
eyed
the
movements
of
the
nervously
as
european
powers
long
ago
were
wont
to
do
in
the
case
of
a
certain
man
of
destiny
and
barred
him
out
of
both
their
possessions
and
venezuela
itself
international
patience
never
had
been
too
sorely
vexed
to
permit
his
return
nevertheless
after
the
manner
of
the
ancient
persecutor
of
the
biblical
martyr
castro
did
not
refrain
from
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
in
fact
he
still
walketh
about
seeking
to
recover
his
hold
upon
venezuela
chapter
mexico
in
revolution
when
in
like
several
of
its
sister
republics
mexico
celebrated
the
centennial
anniversary
of
its
independence
the
era
of
peace
and
progress
inaugurated
by
porfirio
diaz
seemed
likely
to
last
indefinitely
for
he
was
entering
upon
his
eighth
term
as
president
brilliant
as
his
career
had
been
however
and
greatly
as
mexico
had
prospered
under
his
rigid
rule
a
sullen
discontent
had
been
brewing
the
country
that
had
had
but
one
continuous
president
in
years
was
destined
to
have
some
fourteen
chief
magistrates
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
that
time
and
to
surpass
all
its
previous
records
for
rapidity
in
presidential
succession
by
having
one
executive
who
is
said
to
have
held
office
for
precisely
minutes
it
has
often
been
asserted
that
the
reason
for
the
downfall
of
diaz
and
the
lapse
of
mexico
into
the
unhappy
conditions
of
a
half
century
earlier
was
that
he
had
grown
too
old
to
keep
a
firm
grip
on
the
situation
it
has
also
been
declared
that
his
insistence
upon
reelection
and
upon
the
elevation
of
his
own
personal
candidate
to
the
vice
presidency
as
a
successor
in
case
of
his
retirement
occasioned
his
overthrow
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
these
circumstances
were
only
incidental
to
his
downfall
the
real
causes
of
revolution
lay
deeprooted
in
the
history
of
these
years
the
most
significant
feature
of
the
revolt
was
its
civilian
character
a
widespread
public
opinion
had
been
created
a
national
consciousness
had
been
awakened
which
was
intolerant
of
abuses
and
determined
upon
their
removal
at
any
cost
and
this
public
opinion
and
national
consciousness
were
products
of
general
education
which
had
brought
to
the
fore
a
number
of
intelligent
men
eager
to
participate
in
public
affairs
and
yet
barred
out
because
of
their
unwillingness
to
support
the
existing
regime
some
one
has
remarked
and
rightly
that
diaz
in
his
zeal
for
the
material
advancement
of
mexico
mistook
the
tangible
wealth
of
the
country
for
its
welfare
desirable
and
even
necessary
as
that
material
progress
was
it
produced
only
a
prosperity
diaz
was
singularly
deaf
to
the
just
complaints
of
the
people
of
the
laboring
classes
who
as
manufacturing
and
other
industrial
enterprises
developed
were
resolved
to
better
their
conditions
in
the
country
at
large
the
discontent
was
still
stronger
throughout
many
of
the
rural
districts
general
advancement
had
been
retarded
because
of
the
holding
of
huge
areas
of
fertile
land
by
a
comparatively
few
rich
families
who
did
little
to
improve
it
and
were
content
with
small
returns
from
the
labor
of
throngs
of
unskilled
native
cultivators
wretchedly
paid
and
housed
and
toiling
long
hours
the
workers
lived
like
the
serfs
of
medieval
days
or
as
their
own
ancestors
did
in
colonial
times
ignorant
liable
at
any
moment
to
be
dispossessed
of
the
tiny
patch
of
ground
on
which
they
raised
a
few
hills
of
corn
or
beans
most
of
them
were
naturally
a
simple
peaceful
folk
who
in
spite
of
their
misfortunes
might
have
gone
on
indefinitely
with
their
drudgery
in
a
hopeless
apathetic
fashion
unless
their
latent
savage
instincts
happened
to
be
aroused
by
drink
and
the
prospect
of
plunder
on
the
other
hand
the
intelligent
among
them
knowing
that
in
some
of
the
northern
states
of
the
republic
wages
were
higher
and
treatment
fairer
felt
a
sense
of
wrong
which
like
that
of
the
laboring
class
in
the
towns
was
all
the
more
dangerous
because
it
was
not
allowed
to
find
expression
diaz
thought
that
what
mexico
required
above
everything
else
was
the
development
of
industrial
efficiency
and
financial
strength
assured
by
a
maintenance
of
absolute
order
though
disposed
to
do
justice
in
individual
cases
he
would
tolerate
no
class
movements
of
any
kind
labor
unions
strikes
and
other
efforts
at
lightening
the
burden
of
the
workers
he
regarded
as
seditious
and
deserving
of
severe
punishment
in
order
to
attract
capital
from
abroad
as
the
best
means
of
exploiting
the
vast
resources
of
the
country
he
was
willing
to
go
to
any
length
it
would
seem
in
guaranteeing
protection
small
wonder
therefore
that
the
people
who
shared
in
none
of
the
immediate
advantages
from
that
source
should
have
muttered
that
mexico
was
the
mother
of
foreigners
and
the
stepmother
of
mexicans
and
since
so
much
of
the
capital
came
from
the
united
states
the
antiforeign
sentiment
singled
americans
out
for
its
particular
dislike
if
diaz
appeared
unable
to
appreciate
the
significance
of
the
educational
and
industrial
awakening
he
was
no
less
oblivious
of
the
political
outcome
he
knew
of
course
that
the
mexican
constitution
made
impossible
demands
upon
the
political
capacity
of
the
people
he
was
himself
mainly
of
indian
blood
and
he
believed
that
he
understood
the
temperament
and
limitations
of
most
mexicans
knowing
how
tenaciously
they
clung
to
political
notions
he
believed
that
it
was
safer
and
wiser
to
forego
at
least
for
a
time
real
popular
government
and
to
concentrate
power
in
the
hands
of
a
strong
man
who
could
maintain
order
accordingly
backed
by
his
political
adherents
known
as
cientificos
doctrinaires
some
of
whom
had
acquired
a
sinister
ascendancy
over
him
and
also
by
the
church
the
landed
proprietors
and
the
foreign
capitalists
diaz
centered
the
entire
administration
more
and
more
in
himself
elections
became
mere
farces
not
only
the
federal
officials
themselves
but
the
state
governors
the
members
of
the
state
legislatures
and
all
others
in
authority
during
the
later
years
of
his
rule
owed
their
selection
primarily
to
him
and
held
their
positions
only
if
personally
loyal
to
him
confident
of
his
support
and
certain
that
protests
against
misgovernment
would
be
regarded
by
the
president
as
seditious
many
of
them
abused
their
power
at
will
notable
among
them
were
the
local
officials
called
jefes
politicos
whose
control
of
the
police
force
enabled
them
to
indulge
in
practices
of
intimidation
and
extortion
which
ultimately
became
unendurable
though
symptoms
of
popular
wrath
against
the
diaz
regime
or
diazpotism
as
the
mexicans
termed
it
were
apparent
as
early
as
it
was
not
until
january
that
the
actual
revolution
came
it
was
headed
by
francisco
madero
a
member
of
a
wealthy
and
distinguished
family
of
landed
proprietors
in
one
of
the
northern
states
what
the
revolutionists
demanded
in
substance
was
the
retirement
of
the
president
vice
president
and
cabinet
a
return
to
the
principle
of
no
reelection
to
the
chief
magistracy
a
guarantee
of
fair
elections
at
all
times
the
choice
of
capable
honest
and
impartial
judges
jefes
politicos
and
other
officials
and
in
particular
a
series
of
agrarian
and
industrial
reforms
which
would
break
up
the
great
estates
create
peasant
proprietorships
and
better
the
conditions
of
the
working
classes
disposed
at
first
to
treat
the
insurrection
lightly
diaz
soon
found
that
he
had
underestimated
its
strength
grants
of
some
of
the
demands
and
promises
of
reform
were
met
with
a
dogged
insistence
upon
his
own
resignation
then
as
the
rebellion
spread
to
the
southward
the
masterful
old
man
realized
that
his
years
of
rule
were
at
an
end
on
the
of
may
therefore
he
gave
up
his
power
and
sailed
for
europe
madero
was
chosen
president
five
months
later
but
the
revolution
soon
passed
beyond
his
control
he
was
a
sincere
idealist
if
not
something
of
a
visionary
actuated
by
humane
and
kindly
sentiments
but
he
lacked
resoluteness
and
the
art
of
managing
men
he
was
too
prolific
also
of
promises
which
he
must
have
known
he
could
not
keep
yielding
to
family
influence
he
let
his
followers
get
out
of
hand
ambitious
chieftains
and
groups
of
radicals
blocked
and
thwarted
him
at
every
turn
when
he
could
find
no
means
of
carrying
out
his
program
without
wholesale
confiscation
and
the
disruption
of
business
interests
he
was
accused
of
abandoning
his
duty
one
officer
after
another
deserted
him
and
turned
rebel
brigandage
and
insurrection
swept
over
the
country
and
threatened
to
involve
it
in
ugly
complications
with
the
united
states
and
european
powers
at
length
in
february
came
the
blow
that
put
an
end
to
all
of
madero
efforts
and
aspirations
a
military
uprising
in
the
city
of
mexico
made
him
prisoner
forced
him
to
resign
and
set
up
a
provisional
government
under
the
dictatorship
of
victoriano
huerta
one
of
his
chief
lieutenants
two
weeks
later
both
madero
and
the
vice
president
were
assassinated
while
on
their
way
supposedly
to
a
place
of
safety
huerta
was
a
rough
soldier
of
indian
origin
possessed
of
unusual
force
of
character
and
strength
of
will
ruthless
cunning
and
in
bearing
alternately
dignified
and
vulgar
a
scientifico
in
political
faith
he
was
disposed
to
restore
the
diaz
regime
so
far
as
an
application
of
shrewdness
and
force
could
make
it
possible
but
from
the
outset
he
found
an
obstacle
confronting
him
that
he
could
not
surmount
though
acknowledged
by
european
countries
and
by
many
of
the
hispanic
republics
he
could
not
win
recognition
from
the
united
states
either
as
provisional
president
or
as
a
candidate
for
regular
election
to
the
office
whether
personally
responsible
for
the
murder
of
madero
or
not
he
was
not
regarded
by
the
american
government
as
entitled
to
recognition
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
the
choice
of
the
mexican
people
in
its
refusal
to
recognize
an
administration
set
up
merely
by
brute
force
the
united
states
was
upheld
by
argentina
brazil
chile
and
cuba
the
elimination
of
huerta
became
the
chief
feature
for
a
while
of
its
mexican
policy
meanwhile
the
followers
of
madero
and
the
pronounced
radicals
had
found
a
new
northern
leader
in
the
person
of
venustiano
carranza
they
called
themselves
constitutionalists
as
indicative
of
their
purpose
to
reestablish
the
constitution
and
to
choose
a
successor
to
madero
in
a
constitutional
manner
what
they
really
desired
was
those
radical
changes
along
social
industrial
and
political
lines
which
madero
had
championed
in
theory
they
sought
to
introduce
a
species
of
socialistic
regime
that
would
provide
the
mexicans
with
an
opportunity
for
while
diaz
had
believed
in
economic
progress
supported
by
the
great
landed
proprietors
the
moral
influence
of
the
church
and
the
application
of
foreign
capital
the
constitutionalists
personified
in
carranza
were
convinced
that
these
agencies
if
left
free
and
undisturbed
to
work
their
will
would
ruin
mexico
though
not
exactly
antiforeign
in
their
attitude
they
wished
to
curb
the
power
of
the
foreigner
they
would
accept
his
aid
whenever
desirable
for
the
economic
development
of
the
country
but
they
would
not
submit
to
his
virtual
control
of
public
affairs
in
any
case
they
would
tolerate
no
interference
by
the
united
states
compromise
with
the
huerta
regime
therefore
was
impossible
huerta
the
strong
man
of
the
diaz
type
must
go
on
this
point
at
least
the
constitutionalists
were
in
thorough
agreement
with
the
united
states
a
variety
of
international
complications
ensued
both
huertistas
and
carranzistas
perpetrated
outrages
on
foreigners
which
evoked
sharp
protests
and
threats
from
the
united
states
and
european
powers
while
careful
not
to
recognize
his
opponents
officially
the
american
government
resorted
to
all
kinds
of
means
to
oust
the
dictator
an
embargo
was
laid
on
the
export
of
arms
and
munitions
all
efforts
to
procure
financial
help
from
abroad
were
balked
the
power
of
huerta
was
waning
perceptibly
and
that
of
the
constitutionalists
was
increasing
when
an
incident
that
occurred
in
april
at
tampico
brought
matters
to
a
climax
a
number
of
american
sailors
who
had
gone
ashore
to
obtain
supplies
were
arrested
and
temporarily
detained
the
united
states
demanded
that
the
american
flag
be
saluted
as
reparation
for
the
insult
upon
the
refusal
of
huerta
to
comply
the
united
states
sent
a
naval
expedition
to
occupy
vera
cruz
both
carranza
and
huerta
regarded
this
move
as
equivalent
to
an
act
of
war
argentina
brazil
and
chile
then
offered
their
mediation
but
the
conference
arranged
for
this
purpose
at
niagara
falls
canada
had
before
it
a
task
altogether
impossible
of
accomplishment
though
carranza
was
willing
to
have
the
constitutionalists
represented
if
the
discussion
related
solely
to
the
immediate
issue
between
the
united
states
and
huerta
he
declined
to
extend
the
scope
of
the
conference
so
as
to
admit
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
mexico
the
conference
accomplished
nothing
so
far
as
the
immediate
issue
was
concerned
the
dictator
did
not
make
reparation
for
the
affronts
and
indignities
he
had
committed
but
his
day
was
over
the
advance
of
the
constitutionalists
southward
compelled
him
in
july
to
abandon
the
capital
and
leave
the
country
four
months
later
the
american
forces
were
withdrawn
from
vera
cruz
the
a
b
c
conference
however
barren
it
was
of
direct
results
helped
to
allay
suspicions
of
the
united
states
in
hispanic
america
and
brought
appreciably
nearer
a
concert
of
the
western
world
while
far
from
exercising
full
control
throughout
mexico
the
first
chief
of
the
constitutionalists
was
easily
the
dominant
figure
in
the
situation
at
home
a
ranchman
in
public
affairs
a
statesman
of
considerable
ability
knowing
how
to
insist
and
yet
how
to
temporize
carranza
carried
on
a
struggle
both
in
arms
and
in
diplomacy
which
singled
him
out
as
a
remarkable
character
shrewdly
aware
of
the
advantageous
circumstances
afforded
him
by
the
war
in
europe
he
turned
them
to
account
with
a
degree
of
skill
that
blocked
every
attempt
at
defeat
or
compromise
no
matter
how
serious
the
opposition
to
him
in
mexico
itself
how
menacing
the
attitude
of
the
united
states
or
how
persuasive
the
conciliatory
disposition
of
hispanic
american
nations
he
clung
stubbornly
and
tenaciously
to
his
program
even
after
huerta
had
been
eliminated
carranza
position
was
not
assured
for
francisco
or
pancho
villa
a
chieftain
whose
personal
qualities
resembled
those
of
the
fallen
dictator
was
equally
determined
to
eliminate
him
for
a
brief
moment
indeed
peace
reigned
under
an
alleged
agreement
between
them
a
convention
of
constitutionalist
officers
was
to
choose
a
provisional
president
who
should
be
ineligible
as
a
candidate
for
the
permanent
presidency
at
the
regular
elections
when
carranza
assumed
both
of
these
positions
villa
declared
his
act
a
violation
of
their
understanding
and
insisted
upon
his
retirement
inasmuch
as
the
convention
was
dominated
by
villa
the
first
chief
decided
to
ignore
its
election
of
a
provisional
president
the
struggle
between
the
conventionalists
headed
by
villa
and
the
constitutionalists
under
carranza
plunged
mexico
into
worse
discord
and
misery
than
ever
indeed
it
became
a
sort
of
contest
the
third
party
was
emiliano
zapata
an
indian
bandit
nominally
a
supporter
of
villa
but
actually
favorable
to
neither
of
the
rivals
operating
near
the
capital
he
plundered
conventionalists
and
constitutionalists
with
equal
impartiality
and
as
a
diversion
occasionally
occupied
the
city
itself
these
circumstances
gave
force
to
the
saying
that
mexico
was
a
land
where
peace
breaks
out
once
in
a
while
early
in
carranza
proceeded
to
issue
a
number
of
radical
decrees
that
exasperated
foreigners
almost
beyond
endurance
rather
than
resort
to
extreme
measures
again
however
the
united
states
invoked
the
cooperation
of
the
hispanic
republics
and
proposed
a
conference
to
devise
some
solution
of
the
mexican
problem
to
give
the
proposed
conference
a
wider
representation
it
invited
not
only
the
a
b
c
powers
but
bolivia
uruguay
and
guatemala
to
participate
meeting
at
washington
in
august
the
mediators
encountered
the
same
difficulty
which
had
confronted
their
predecessors
at
niagara
falls
though
the
other
chieftains
assented
carranza
now
certain
of
success
declined
to
heed
any
proposal
of
conciliation
characterizing
efforts
of
the
kind
as
an
unwarranted
interference
in
the
internal
affairs
of
a
sister
nation
he
warned
the
hispanic
republics
against
setting
up
so
dangerous
a
precedent
in
reply
argentina
stated
that
the
conference
obeyed
a
lofty
inspiration
of
solidarity
and
instead
of
finding
any
cause
for
alarm
the
mexican
people
should
see
in
it
a
proof
of
their
friendly
consideration
that
her
fate
evokes
in
us
and
calls
forth
our
good
wishes
for
her
pacification
and
development
however
as
the
only
apparent
escape
from
more
watchful
waiting
or
from
armed
intervention
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
in
october
the
seven
governments
decided
to
accept
the
facts
as
they
stood
and
accordingly
recognized
carranza
as
the
de
facto
ruler
of
mexico
enraged
at
this
favor
shown
to
his
rival
villa
determined
deliberately
to
provoke
american
intervention
by
a
murderous
raid
on
a
town
in
new
mexico
in
march
when
the
united
states
dispatched
an
expedition
to
avenge
the
outrage
carranza
protested
energetically
against
its
violation
of
mexican
territory
and
demanded
its
withdrawal
several
clashes
in
fact
occurred
between
american
soldiers
and
carranzistas
neither
the
expedition
itself
however
nor
diplomatic
efforts
to
find
some
method
of
cooperation
which
would
prevent
constant
trouble
along
the
frontier
served
any
useful
purpose
since
villa
apparently
could
not
be
captured
and
carranza
refused
to
yield
to
diplomatic
persuasion
carranza
then
proposed
that
a
joint
commission
be
appointed
to
settle
these
vexed
questions
even
this
device
proved
wholly
unsatisfactory
the
mexicans
would
not
concede
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
send
an
armed
expedition
into
their
country
at
any
time
and
the
americans
refused
to
accept
limitations
on
the
kind
of
troops
that
they
might
employ
or
on
the
zone
of
their
operations
in
january
the
joint
commission
was
dissolved
and
the
american
soldiers
were
withdrawn
again
the
first
chief
had
won
on
the
of
february
a
convention
assembled
at
queretaro
promulgated
a
constitution
embodying
substantially
all
of
the
radical
program
that
carranza
had
anticipated
in
his
decrees
besides
providing
for
an
elaborate
improvement
in
the
condition
of
the
laboring
classes
and
for
such
a
division
of
great
estates
as
might
satisfy
their
particular
needs
the
new
constitution
imposed
drastic
restrictions
upon
foreigners
and
religious
bodies
under
its
terms
foreigners
could
not
acquire
industrial
concessions
unless
they
waived
their
treaty
rights
and
consented
to
regard
themselves
for
the
purpose
as
mexican
citizens
in
all
such
cases
preference
was
to
be
shown

over

no

must
refrain
from

the

was
reduced
from
six
years
to

reelection
was
prohibited
and
the

the

the
course

in
certain
of
the

in

around

warned
the

that
independence
was
a
relative
condition
and
that
it
might
vary
in
direct
ratio
with
nearness
to
the

showed

official

nonrecognition
promised
to
be
an

way
of
maintaining
a

of

big

not

carry

to

american
ears
the
smaller
countries
in

around
the
caribbean
sea
at
least
seemed
likely
to
become
virtually
american
protectorates
like
their
hispanic
neighbor
on
the
north
the
little
republics
of
central
america
were
also
scenes
of
political
disturbance
none
of
them
except
panama
escaped
revolutionary
uprisings
though
the
loss
of
life
and
property
was
insignificant
on
the
other
hand
in
these
early
years
of
the
century
the
five
countries
north
of
panama
made
substantial
progress
toward
federation
as
a
south
american
writer
has
expressed
it
their
previous
efforts
in
that
direction
amid
sumptuous
festivals
banquets
and
other
solemn
public
acts
at
which
they
intoned
in
lyric
accents
daily
hymns
for
the
imperishable
reunion
of
the
isthmian
republics
had
been
as
illusory
as
they
were
frequent
despite
the
mediation
of
the
united
states
and
mexico
in
while
the
latter
was
still
ruled
by
diaz
the
struggle
in
which
nicaragua
honduras
guatemala
and
salvador
had
been
engaged
was
soon
renewed
between
the
first
two
belligerents
since
diplomatic
interposition
no
longer
availed
american
marines
were
landed
in
nicaragua
and
the
bumptious
zelaya
was
induced
to
have
his
country
meet
its
neighbors
in
a
conference
at
washington
under
the
auspices
of
the
united
states
and
mexico
in
december
representatives
of
the
five
republics
signed
a
series
of
conventions
providing
for
peace
and
cooperation
an
arbitral
court
of
justice
to
be
erected
in
costa
rica
and
composed
of
one
judge
from
each
nation
was
to
decide
all
matters
of
dispute
which
could
not
be
adjusted
through
ordinary
diplomatic
means
here
also
an
institute
for
the
training
of
central
american
teachers
was
to
be
established
annual
conferences
were
to
discuss
and
an
office
in
guatemala
was
to
record
measures
designed
to
secure
uniformity
in
financial
commercial
industrial
sanitary
and
educational
regulations
honduras
the
storm
center
of
weakness
was
to
be
neutralized
none
of
the
states
was
thereafter
to
recognize
in
any
of
them
a
government
which
had
been
set
up
in
an
illegal
fashion
a
constitutional
act
of
central
american
fraternity
moreover
was
adopted
on
behalf
of
peace
harmony
and
progress
toward
a
realization
of
the
several
objects
of
the
conference
the
presidents
of
the
five
republics
were
to
invite
their
colleagues
of
the
united
states
and
mexico
whenever
needful
to
appoint
representatives
to
lend
their
good
offices
in
a
purely
friendly
way
though
most
of
these
agencies
were
promptly
put
into
operation
the
results
were
not
altogether
satisfactory
some
discords
to
be
sure
were
removed
by
treaties
settling
boundary
questions
and
providing
for
reciprocal
trade
advantages
but
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
arrangements
devised
at
washington
would
have
worked
at
all
if
the
united
states
had
not
kept
the
little
countries
under
a
certain
amount
of
observation
what
the
central
americans
apparently
preferred
was
to
be
left
alone
some
of
them
to
mind
their
own
business
others
to
mind
their
affairs
of
all
the
central
american
countries
honduras
was
perhaps
the
one
most
afflicted
with
pecuniary
misfortunes
in
its
foreign
debt
along
with
arrears
of
interest
unpaid
for
years
was
estimated
at
upwards
of
of
this
amount
a
large
part
consisted
of
loans
obtained
from
foreign
capitalists
at
more
or
less
extortionate
rates
for
the
construction
of
a
short
railway
of
which
less
than
half
had
been
built
that
revolutions
should
be
rather
chronic
in
a
land
where
so
much
money
could
be
squandered
and
where
the
temperaments
of
presidents
and
were
so
bellicose
was
natural
enough
when
the
united
states
could
not
induce
the
warring
rivals
to
abide
by
fair
elections
it
sent
a
force
of
marines
to
overawe
them
and
gave
warning
that
further
disturbances
would
not
be
allowed
in
nicaragua
the
conditions
were
similar
here
zelaya
restive
under
the
limitations
set
by
the
conference
at
washington
yearned
to
become
the
strong
man
of
central
america
who
would
teach
the
yankees
to
stop
their
meddling
but
his
downfall
was
imminent
in
as
the
result
of
his
execution
of
two
american
soldiers
of
fortune
who
had
taken
part
in
a
recent
insurrection
the
united
states
resolved
to
tolerate
zelaya
no
longer
openly
recognizing
the
insurgents
it
forced
the
dictator
out
of
the
country
three
years
later
when
a
started
to
assume
office
before
the
legally
appointed
time
a
force
of
american
marines
at
the
capital
convinced
him
that
such
a
procedure
was
undesirable
the
corrupt
and
barbarous
conditions
prevailing
in
zelaya
time
he
was
informed
could
not
be
tolerated
the
united
states
in
fact
notified
all
parties
in
nicaragua
that
under
the
terms
of
the
washington
conventions
it
had
a
moral
mandate
to
exert
its
influence
for
the
preservation
of
the
general
peace
of
central
america
since
those
agreements
had
vested
no
one
with
authority
to
enforce
them
such
an
interpretation
of
their
language
aimed
apparently
at
all
disturbances
foreign
as
well
as
domestic
was
rather
elastic
at
all
events
after
when
a
new
constitution
was
adopted
the
country
became
relatively
quiet
and
somewhat
progressive
whenever
a
political
flurry
did
take
place
american
marines
were
employed
to
preserve
the
peace
many
citizens
therefore
declined
to
vote
on
the
ground
that
the
moral
and
material
support
thus
furnished
by
the
great
nation
to
the
northward
rendered
it
futile
for
them
to
assume
political
responsibilities
meanwhile
negotiations
began
which
were
ultimately
to
make
nicaragua
a
fiscal
protectorate
of
the
united
states
american
officials
were
chosen
to
act
as
financial
advisers
and
collectors
of
customs
and
favorable
arrangements
were
concluded
with
american
bankers
regarding
the
monetary
situation
but
it
was
not
until
that
a
treaty
covering
this
situation
was
ratified
according
to
its
provisions
in
return
for
a
stipulated
sum
to
be
expended
under
american
direction
nicaragua
was
to
grant
to
the
united
states
the
exclusive
privilege
of
constructing
a
canal
through
the
territory
of
the
republic
and
to
lease
to
it
the
corn
islands
and
a
part
of
fonseca
bay
on
the
pacific
coast
for
use
as
naval
stations
the
prospect
of
american
intervention
alarmed
the
neighboring
republics
asserting
that
the
treaty
infringed
upon
their
respective
boundaries
costa
rica
and
salvador
brought
suit
against
nicaragua
before
the
central
american
court
with
the
exception
of
the
nicaraguan
representative
the
judges
upheld
the
contention
of
the
plaintiffs
that
the
defendant
had
no
right
to
make
any
such
concessions
without
previous
consultation
with
costa
rica
salvador
and
honduras
since
all
three
alike
were
affected
by
them
the
court
observed
however
that
it
could
not
declare
the
treaty
void
because
the
united
states
one
of
the
parties
concerned
was
not
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
nicaragua
declined
to
accept
the
decision
and
the
united
states
the
country
responsible
for
the
existence
of
the
court
and
presumably
interested
in
helping
to
enforce
its
judgment
allowed
it
to
go
out
of
existence
in
on
the
expiration
of
its
term
the
economic
situation
of
costa
rica
brought
about
a
state
of
affairs
wholly
unusual
in
central
american
politics
the
president
alfredo
gonzalez
wished
to
reform
the
system
of
taxation
so
that
a
fairer
share
of
the
public
burdens
should
fall
on
the
great
landholders
who
like
most
of
their
brethren
in
the
hispanic
countries
were
practically
exempt
this
project
coupled
with
the
fact
that
certain
american
citizens
seeking
an
oil
concession
had
undermined
the
power
of
the
president
by
wholesale
bribery
induced
the
minister
of
war
in
to
start
a
revolt
against
him
rather
than
shed
the
blood
of
his
fellow
citizens
for
mere
personal
advantages
gonzalez
sustained
the
good
reputation
of
costa
rica
for
freedom
from
civil
commotions
by
quietly
leaving
the
country
and
going
to
the
united
states
to
present
his
case
in
consequence
the
american
government
declined
to
recognize
the
de
facto
ruler
police
and
fiscal
supervision
by
the
united
states
has
characterized
the
recent
history
of
panama
not
only
has
a
proposed
increase
in
the
customs
duties
been
disallowed
but
more
than
once
the
unrest
attending
presidential
elections
has
required
the
calming
presence
of
american
officials
as
a
means
of
forestalling
outbreaks
particularly
in
view
of
the
cosmopolitan
population
resident
on
the
isthmus
the
republic
enacted
a
law
in
which
forbade
foreigners
to
mix
in
local
politics
and
authorized
the
expulsion
of
naturalized
citizens
who
attacked
the
government
through
the
press
or
otherwise
with
the
approval
of
the
united
states
panama
entered
into
an
agreement
with
american
financiers
providing
for
the
creation
of
a
national
bank
of
the
directors
of
which
should
be
named
by
the
government
of
the
republic
the
second
period
of
american
rule
in
cuba
lasted
till
control
of
the
government
was
then
formally
transferred
to
jose
miguel
gomez
the
president
who
had
been
chosen
by
the
liberals
at
the
elections
held
in
the
previous
year
but
the
united
states
did
not
cease
to
watch
over
its
chief
caribbean
ward
a
bitter
controversy
soon
developed
in
the
cuban
congress
over
measures
to
forbid
the
further
purchase
of
land
by
aliens
and
to
insure
that
a
certain
percentage
of
the
public
offices
should
be
held
by
colored
citizens
though
both
projects
were
defeated
they
revealed
a
strong
antiforeign
sentiment
and
much
dissatisfaction
on
the
part
of
the
negro
population
it
was
clear
also
that
gomez
intended
to
oust
all
conservatives
from
office
for
an
obedient
congress
passed
a
bill
suspending
the
civil
service
rules
the
partisanship
of
gomez
and
his
supporters
together
with
the
constant
interference
of
military
veterans
in
political
affairs
provoked
numerous
outbreaks
which
led
the
united
states
in
to
warn
cuba
that
it
might
again
be
compelled
to
intervene
eventually
when
a
negro
insurrection
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
island
menaced
the
safety
of
foreigners
american
marines
were
landed
another
instance
of
intervention
was
the
objection
by
the
united
states
to
an
liability
law
that
would
have
given
a
monopoly
of
the
insurance
business
to
a
cuban
company
to
the
detriment
of
american
firms
after
the
election
of
mario
menocal
the
conservative
candidate
to
the
presidency
in
another
occasion
for
intervention
presented
itself
an
amnesty
bill
originally
drafted
for
the
purpose
of
freeing
the
colored
insurgents
and
other
offenders
was
amended
so
as
to
empower
the
retiring
president
to
grant
pardon
before
trial
to
persons
whom
his
successor
wished
to
prosecute
for
wholesale
corruption
in
financial
transactions
before
the
bill
passed
however
notice
was
sent
from
washington
that
since
the
american
government
had
the
authority
to
supervise
the
finances
of
the
republic
gomez
would
better
veto
the
bill
and
this
he
accordingly
did
a
sharp
struggle
arose
when
it
became
known
that
menocal
would
be
a
candidate
for
reelection
the
liberal
majority
in
the
congress
passed
a
bill
requiring
that
a
president
who
sought
to
succeed
himself
should
resign
two
months
before
the
elections
when
menocal
vetoed
this
measure
his
opponents
demanded
that
the
united
states
supervise
the
elections
as
the
result
of
the
elections
was
doubtful
gomez
and
his
followers
resorted
in
to
the
usual
insurrection
whereupon
the
american
government
warned
the
rebels
that
it
would
not
recognize
their
claims
if
they
won
by
force
active
aid
from
that
quarter
as
well
as
the
capture
of
the
insurgent
leader
caused
the
movement
to
collapse
after
the
electoral
college
had
decided
in
favor
of
menocal
in
the
dominican
republic
disturbances
were
frequent
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
american
officials
were
in
charge
of
the
customhouses
and
by
their
presence
were
expected
to
exert
a
quieting
influence
even
the
adoption
in
of
a
new
constitution
which
provided
for
the
prolongation
of
the
presidential
term
to
six
years
and
for
the
abolition
of
the
office
of
vice
president
two
stabilizing
devices
quite
common
in
hispanic
countries
where
personal
ambition
is
prone
to
be
a
source
of
political
trouble
did
not
help
much
to
restore
order
the
assassination
of
the
president
and
the
persistence
of
quarrels
with
haiti
over
boundaries
made
matters
worse
thereupon
in
the
united
states
served
formal
notice
on
the
rebellious
parties
that
it
would
not
only
refuse
to
recognize
any
government
set
up
by
force
but
would
withhold
any
share
in
the
receipts
from
the
customs
as
this
procedure
did
not
prevent
a
revolutionary
leader
from
demanding
half
a
million
dollars
as
a
financial
sedative
for
his
political
nerves
and
from
creating
more
trouble
when
the
president
failed
to
dispense
it
the
heavy
hand
of
an
american
naval
force
administered
another
kind
of
specific
until
commissioners
from
porto
rico
could
arrive
to
superintend
the
selection
of
a
new
chief
magistrate
notwithstanding
the
protest
of
the
dominican
government
the
fairest
and
freest
elections
ever
known
in
the
country
were
held
under
the
direction
of
those
officials
as
a
body
of
friendly
observers
however
amicable
this
arrangement
seemed
it
did
not
smother
the
flames
of
discord
in
when
an
american
naval
commander
suggested
that
a
rebellious
minister
of
war
leave
the
capital
he
agreed
to
do
so
if
the
fairest
and
freest
of
chosen
presidents
would
resign
even
after
both
of
them
had
complied
with
the
suggestions
the
individuals
who
assumed
their
respective
offices
were
soon
at
loggerheads
accordingly
the
united
states
placed
the
republic
under
military
rule
until
a
president
could
be
elected
who
might
be
able
to
retain
his
post
without
too
much
friendly
observation
from
washington
and
a
minister
of
war
could
be
appointed
who
would
refrain
from
making
war
on
the
president
then
the
organization
of
a
new
party
to
combat
the
previous
inordinate
display
of
personalities
in
politics
created
some
hope
that
the
republic
would
accomplish
its
own
redemption
only
because
of
its
relation
to
the
wars
of
emancipation
and
to
the
dominican
republic
need
the
negro
state
of
haiti
occupying
the
western
part
of
the
caribbean
island
be
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
story
of
the
hispanic
nations
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
fact
that
their
color
was
different
and
that
they
spoke
a
variant
of
french
instead
of
spanish
did
not
prevent
the
inhabitants
of
this
state
from
offering
a
far
worse
spectacle
of
political
and
financial
demoralization
than
did
their
neighbors
to
the
eastward
perpetual
commotions
and
repeated
interventions
by
american
and
european
naval
forces
on
behalf
of
the
foreign
residents
eventually
made
it
imperative
for
the
united
states
to
take
direct
charge
of
the
republic
in
by
a
convention
which
placed
the
finances
under
american
control
created
a
native
constabulary
under
american
officers
and
imposed
a
number
of
other
restraints
the
united
states
converted
haiti
into
what
is
practically
a
protectorate
chapter
xii
and
the
great
war
while
the
hispanic
republics
were
entering
upon
the
second
century
of
their
independent
life
the
idea
of
a
certain
community
of
interests
between
themselves
and
the
united
states
began
to
assume
a
fairly
definite
form
though
emphasized
by
american
statesmen
and
publicists
in
particular
the
new
point
of
view
was
not
generally
understood
or
appreciated
by
the
people
of
either
this
country
or
its
fellow
nations
to
the
southward
it
seemed
nevertheless
to
promise
an
effective
cooperation
in
spirit
and
action
between
them
and
came
therefore
to
be
called
this
sentiment
of
solidarity
sprang
from
several
sources
the
periodical
conferences
of
the
united
states
and
its
sister
republics
gave
occasion
for
an
interchange
of
official
courtesies
and
expressions
of
good
feeling
doubtless
also
the
presence
of
delegates
from
the
hispanic
countries
at
the
international
gatherings
at
the
hague
served
to
acquaint
the
world
at
large
with
the
stability
strength
wealth
and
culture
of
their
respective
lands
individual
americans
took
an
active
interest
in
their
fellows
of
hispanic
stock
and
found
their
interest
reciprocated
motives
of
business
or
pleasure
and
a
desire
to
obtain
personal
knowledge
about
one
another
led
to
visits
and
countervisits
that
became
steadily
more
frequent
societies
were
created
to
encourage
the
friendship
and
acquaintance
thus
formed
scientific
congresses
were
held
and
institutes
were
founded
in
which
both
the
united
states
and
hispanic
america
were
represented
books
articles
and
newspaper
accounts
about
one
another
countries
were
published
in
increasing
volume
educational
institutions
devoted
a
constantly
growing
attention
to
affairs
individuals
and
commissions
were
dispatched
by
the
hispanic
nations
and
the
united
states
to
study
one
conditions
and
to
confer
about
matters
of
mutual
concern
secretaries
of
state
ministers
of
foreign
affairs
and
other
distinguished
personages
interchanged
visits
above
all
the
common
dangers
and
responsibilities
falling
upon
the
americas
at
large
as
a
consequence
of
the
european
war
seemed
likely
to
bring
the
several
nations
into
a
harmony
of
feeling
and
relationship
to
which
they
had
never
before
attained
however
was
destined
to
remain
largely
a
generous
ideal
the
action
of
the
united
states
in
extending
its
direct
influence
over
the
small
republics
in
and
around
the
caribbean
aroused
the
suspicion
and
alarm
of
hispanic
americans
who
still
feared
imperialistic
designs
on
the
part
of
that
country
now
more
than
ever
the
colossus
of
the
north
the
art
of
oratory
among
the
yankees
declared
a
south
american
critic
is
lavish
with
a
fraternal
idealism
but
strong
wills
enforce
their
imperialistic
ambitions
impassioned
speakers
and
writers
adjured
the
ghost
of
hispanic
confederation
to
rise
and
confront
the
new
northern
peril
they
even
advocated
an
appeal
to
great
britain
germany
or
japan
and
they
urged
closer
economic
social
and
intellectual
relations
with
the
countries
of
europe
it
was
while
the
united
states
was
thus
widening
the
sphere
of
its
influence
in
the
caribbean
that
the
a
b
c
powers
argentina
brazil
and
chile
reached
an
understanding
which
was
in
a
sense
a
measure
of
for
some
years
cordial
relations
had
existed
among
these
three
nations
which
had
grown
so
remarkably
in
strength
and
prestige
it
was
felt
that
by
united
action
they
might
set
up
in
the
new
world
the
european
principle
of
a
balance
of
power
assume
the
leadership
in
hispanic
america
and
serve
in
some
degree
as
a
counterpoise
to
the
united
states
nevertheless
they
were
disposed
to
cooperate
with
their
northern
neighbor
in
the
peaceable
adjustment
of
conflicts
in
which
other
hispanic
countries
were
concerned
provided
that
the
mediation
carried
on
by
such
a
concert
of
the
western
world
did
not
include
actual
intervention
in
the
internal
affairs
of
the
countries
involved
with
this
attitude
of
the
public
mind
it
is
not
strange
that
the
hispanic
republics
at
large
should
have
been
inclined
to
look
with
scant
favor
upon
proposals
made
by
the
united
states
in
to
render
the
spirit
of
more
precise
in
its
operation
the
proposals
in
substance
were
these
that
all
the
nations
of
america
mutually
agree
to
guarantee
the
territorial
integrity
of
one
another
to
maintain
a
republican
form
of
government
to
prohibit
the
exportation
of
arms
to
any
but
the
legally
constituted
governments
and
to
adopt
laws
of
neutrality
which
would
make
it
impossible
to
filibustering
expeditions
to
threaten
or
carry
on
revolutions
in
neighboring
republics
these
proposals
appear
to
have
received
no
formal
approval
beyond
what
is
signified
by
the
diplomatic
expression
in
principle
considering
the
disparity
in
strength
wealth
and
prestige
between
the
northern
country
and
its
southern
fellows
suggestions
of
the
sort
could
be
made
practicable
only
by
letting
the
united
states
do
whatever
it
might
think
needful
to
accomplish
the
objects
which
it
sought
obviously
the
hispanic
nations
singly
or
collectively
would
hardly
venture
to
take
any
such
action
within
the
borders
of
the
united
states
itself
if
for
example
it
failed
to
maintain
what
in
their
opinion
was
a
republican
form
of
government
a
full
acceptance
of
the
plan
accordingly
would
have
amounted
to
a
recognition
of
american
overlordship
and
this
they
were
naturally
not
disposed
to
admit
the
common
perils
and
duties
confronting
the
americas
as
a
result
of
the
great
war
however
made
close
cooperation
between
the
hispanic
republics
and
the
united
states
up
to
a
certain
point
indispensable
toward
that
transatlantic
struggle
the
attitude
of
all
the
nations
of
the
new
world
at
the
outset
was
substantially
the
same
though
strongly
sympathetic
on
the
whole
with
the
allies
and
notably
with
france
the
southern
countries
nevertheless
declared
their
neutrality
more
than
that
they
tried
to
convert
neutrality
into
a
policy
instead
of
regarding
it
as
an
official
attitude
to
be
adopted
by
the
republics
separately
thus
when
the
conflict
overseas
began
to
injure
the
rights
of
neutrals
argentina
and
other
nations
urged
that
the
countries
of
the
new
world
jointly
agree
to
declare
that
direct
maritime
commerce
between
american
lands
should
be
considered
as
coastwise
trade
and
that
the
merchant
ships
engaged
in
it
whatever
the
flag
under
which
they
sailed
should
be
looked
upon
as
neutral
though
the
south
american
countries
failed
to
enlist
the
support
of
their
northern
neighbor
in
this
bold
departure
from
international
precedent
they
found
some
compensation
for
their
disappointment
in
the
closer
commercial
and
financial
relations
which
they
established
with
the
united
states
because
of
the
dependence
of
the
hispanic
nations
and
especially
those
of
the
southern
group
on
the
intimacy
of
their
economic
ties
with
the
belligerents
overseas
they
suffered
from
the
ravages
of
the
struggle
more
perhaps
than
other
lands
outside
of
europe
negotiations
for
prospective
loans
were
dropped
industries
were
suspended
work
on
public
improvements
was
checked
and
commerce
brought
almost
to
a
standstill
as
the
revenues
fell
off
and
ready
money
became
scarce
drastic
measures
had
to
be
devised
to
meet
the
financial
strain
for
the
protection
of
credit
bank
holidays
were
declared
stock
exchanges
were
closed
moratoria
were
set
up
in
nearly
all
the
countries
taxes
and
duties
were
increased
radical
reductions
in
expenditure
were
undertaken
and
in
a
few
cases
large
quantities
of
paper
money
were
issued
with
the
european
market
thus
wholly
or
partially
cut
off
the
hispanic
republics
were
forced
to
supply
the
consequent
shortage
with
manufactured
articles
and
other
goods
from
the
united
states
and
to
send
thither
their
raw
materials
in
exchange
to
their
northern
neighbor
they
had
to
turn
also
for
pecuniary
aid
a
financial
conference
was
held
at
washington
in
and
an
international
high
commission
was
appointed
to
carry
its
recommendations
into
effect
gradually
most
of
the
hispanic
countries
came
to
show
a
favorable
trade
balance
then
as
the
war
drew
into
its
fourth
year
several
of
them
even
began
to
enjoy
great
prosperity
that
had
not
meant
much
more
than
cooperation
for
economic
ends
seemed
evident
when
on
april
the
united
states
declared
war
on
germany
instead
of
following
spontaneously
in
the
wake
of
their
great
northern
neighbor
the
hispanic
republics
were
divided
by
conflicting
currents
of
opinion
and
hesitated
as
to
their
proper
course
of
procedure
while
a
majority
of
them
expressed
approval
of
what
the
united
states
had
done
and
while
uruguay
for
its
part
asserted
that
no
american
country
which
in
defense
of
its
own
rights
should
find
itself
in
a
state
of
war
with
nations
of
other
continents
would
be
treated
as
a
belligerent
mexico
veered
almost
to
the
other
extreme
by
proposing
that
the
republics
of
america
agree
to
lay
an
embargo
on
the
shipment
of
munitions
to
the
warring
powers
as
a
matter
of
fact
only
seven
out
of
the
nineteen
hispanic
nations
saw
fit
to
imitate
the
example
set
by
their
northern
neighbor
and
to
declare
war
on
germany
these
were
cuba
in
view
of
its
duty
toward
the
united
states
panama
guatemala
brazil
honduras
nicaragua
and
costa
rica
since
the
dominican
republic
at
the
time
was
under
american
military
control
it
was
not
in
a
position
to
choose
its
course
four
countries
ecuador
peru
bolivia
and
uruguay
broke
off
diplomatic
relations
with
germany
the
other
seven
republics
mexico
salvador
colombia
venezuela
chile
argentina
and
paraguay
continued
their
formal
neutrality
in
spite
of
a
disclosure
made
by
the
united
states
of
insulting
and
threatening
utterances
on
the
part
of
the
german
charge
in
argentina
which
led
to
popular
outbreaks
at
the
capital
and
induced
the
national
congress
to
declare
in
favor
of
a
severance
of
diplomatic
relations
with
that
functionary
government
the
president
of
the
republic
stood
firm
in
his
resolution
to
maintain
neutrality
if
had
ever
involved
the
idea
of
political
cooperation
among
the
nations
of
the
new
world
it
broke
down
just
when
it
might
have
served
the
greatest
of
purposes
even
the
a
b
c
combination
itself
had
apparently
been
shattered
a
century
and
more
had
now
passed
since
the
spanish
and
portuguese
peoples
of
the
new
world
had
achieved
their
independence
eighteen
political
children
of
various
sizes
and
stages
of
advancement
or
backwardness
were
born
of
spain
in
america
and
one
acknowledged
the
maternity
of
portugal
big
brazil
has
always
maintained
the
happiest
relations
with
the
little
mother
in
europe
who
still
watches
with
pride
the
growth
of
her
strapping
youngster
between
spain
and
her
descendants
however
animosity
endured
for
many
years
after
they
had
thrown
off
the
parental
yoke
yet
of
late
much
has
been
done
on
both
sides
to
render
the
relationship
cordial
the
graceful
act
of
spain
in
sending
the
infanta
isabel
to
represent
her
in
argentina
and
chile
at
the
celebration
of
the
centennial
anniversary
of
their
cry
for
independence
and
to
wish
them
godspeed
on
their
onward
journey
was
typical
of
the
yearning
of
the
mother
country
for
her
children
overseas
despite
the
lapse
of
years
and
political
ties
so
too
her
ablest
men
of
intellect
have
striven
nobly
and
with
marked
success
to
revive
among
them
a
sense
of
filial
affection
and
gratitude
for
all
that
spain
contributed
to
mold
the
mind
and
heart
of
her
kindred
in
distant
lands
on
their
part
the
hispanic
americans
have
come
to
a
clearer
consciousness
of
the
fact
that
on
the
continents
of
the
new
world
there
are
two
distinct
types
of
civilization
with
all
that
each
connotes
of
differences
in
race
psychology
tradition
language
and
custom
their
own
and
that
represented
by
the

appreciative
though
the
southern
countries
are
of
their
northern
neighbor
they
cling
nevertheless
to
their
heritage
from

in
whatever
seems
conducive
to
the
maintenance
of
their

of

and
