when
asked
what
things
boys
should
learn
replied
those
which
they
will
when
they
become
men
as
health
requires
the
observance
of
the
laws
inherent
to
the
different
organs
of
the
human
system
so
not
only
boys
but
girls
should
acquire
a
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
their
organization
if
sound
morality
depends
upon
the
inculcation
of
correct
principles
in
youth
equally
so
does
a
sound
physical
system
depend
on
a
correct
physical
education
during
the
same
period
of
life
if
the
teacher
and
parents
who
are
deficient
in
moral
feelings
and
sentiments
are
unfit
to
communicate
to
children
and
youth
those
high
moral
principles
demanded
by
the
nature
of
man
so
are
they
equally
incompetent
directors
of
the
physical
training
of
the
youthful
system
if
ignorant
of
the
organic
laws
and
the
physiological
conditions
upon
which
health
and
disease
depend
for
these
reasons
the
study
of
the
structure
of
the
human
system
and
the
laws
of
the
different
organs
are
subjects
of
interest
to
all
the
young
and
the
old
the
learned
and
the
unlearned
the
rich
and
the
poor
every
scholar
and
particularly
every
young
miss
after
acquiring
a
knowledge
of
the
primary
branches
as
spelling
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
should
learn
the
structure
of
the
human
system
and
the
conditions
upon
which
health
and
disease
depend
as
this
knowledge
will
be
required
in
in
after
life
it
is
somewhat
unaccountable
says
dick
and
not
a
little
inconsistent
that
while
we
direct
the
young
to
look
abroad
over
the
surface
of
the
earth
and
survey
its
mountains
rivers
seas
and
continents
and
guide
their
views
to
the
regions
of
the
firmament
where
they
may
contemplate
the
moons
of
jupiter
the
rings
of
saturn
and
thousands
of
luminaries
placed
at
immeasurable
distances
that
we
should
never
teach
them
look
into
to
consider
their
own
corporeal
structures
the
numerous
parts
of
which
they
are
composed
the
admirable
functions
they
perform
the
wisdom
and
goodness
displayed
in
their
mechanism
and
the
lessons
of
practical
instruction
which
may
be
derived
from
such
contemplations
again
he
says
one
great
practical
end
which
should
always
be
kept
in
view
in
the
study
of
physiology
is
the
invigoration
and
improvement
of
the
corporeal
powers
and
functions
the
preservation
of
health
and
the
prevention
of
disease
the
design
of
the
following
pages
is
to
diffuse
in
the
community
especially
among
the
youth
a
knowledge
of
human
anatomy
physiology
and
hygiene
to
make
the
work
clear
and
practical
the
following
method
has
been
adopted
the
structure
of
the
different
organs
of
the
system
has
been
described
in
a
clear
and
concise
manner
to
render
this
description
more
intelligible
one
hundred
and
fifty
engravings
have
been
introduced
to
show
the
situation
of
the
various
organs
hence
the
work
may
be
regarded
as
an
elementary
treatise
on
anatomy
the
functions
or
uses
of
the
several
parts
have
been
briefly
and
plainly
detailed
making
a
primary
treatise
on
human
physiology
to
make
a
knowledge
of
the
structure
and
functions
of
the
different
organs
the
laws
of
the
several
parts
and
the
conditions
on
which
health
depends
have
been
clearly
and
succinctly
explained
hence
it
may
be
called
a
treatise
on
the
principles
of
hygiene
or
health
to
render
this
department
more
complete
there
has
been
added
the
appropriate
treatment
for
burns
wounds
hemorrhage
from
divided
arteries
the
management
of
persons
asphyxiated
from
drowning
carbonic
acid
or
strangling
directions
for
nurses
watchers
and
the
removal
of
disease
together
with
an
appendix
containing
antidotes
for
poisons
so
that
persons
may
know
what
be
and
what
not
be
until
a
surgeon
or
physician
can
be
called
in
attempting
to
effect
this
in
a
brief
elementary
treatise
designed
for
schools
and
families
it
has
not
been
deemed
necessary
to
use
vulgar
phrases
for
the
purpose
of
being
understood
the
appropriate
scientific
term
should
be
applied
to
each
organ
no
more
effort
is
required
to
learn
the
meaning
of
a
than
an
improper
term
for
example
a
child
will
pronounce
the
word
as
readily
and
obtain
as
correct
an
idea
if
you
say
as
if
you
used
the
word
a
little
effort
on
the
part
of
teachers
and
parents
would
diminish
the
number
of
vulgar
terms
and
phrases
and
consequently
improve
the
language
of
our
country
to
obviate
all
objections
to
the
use
of
proper
scientific
terms
a
glossary
has
been
appended
to
the
work
the
author
makes
no
pretensions
to
new
discoveries
in
physiological
science
in
preparing
the
anatomical
department
the
able
treatises
of
wilson
cruveilhier
and
others
have
been
freely
consulted
in
the
physiological
part
the
splendid
works
of
carpenter
dunglison
liebig
and
others
have
been
perused
in
the
department
of
hygiene
many
valuable
hints
have
been
obtained
from
the
meritorious
works
of
combe

and
whose
valuable

rendered
important
aid
in
preparing
the
manuscript
for
the
present
stereotype

we
return
our
acknowledgments
for
the
aid
afforded
by
the
principals
of
the
several
academies
and
normal
schools
who
formed
classes
in
their
institutions
and
examined
the
revised
edition
as
their
pupils
progressed
thus
giving
the
work
the
best
possible
test
trial
namely
the
to
the
examination
of
an
intelligent
public
the
work
is
respectfully
submitted
by
calvin
cutter
warren
to
teachers
and
parents
as
the
work
is
divided
into
chapters
the
subjects
of
which
are
complete
in
themselves
the
pupil
may
commence
the
study
of
the
structure
use
and
laws
of
the
several
parts
of
which
the
human
system
is
composed
by
selecting
such
chapters
as
fancy
or
utility
may
dictate
without
reference
to
their
present
arrangement
as
well
commence
with
the
chapter
on
the
digestive
organs
as
on
the
bones
the
acquisition
of
a
correct
pronunciation
of
the
technical
words
is
of
great
importance
both
in
recitation
and
in
conversation
in
this
work
the
technical
words
interspersed
with
the
text
have
been
divided
into
syllables
and
the
accented
syllables
designated
an
ample
glossary
of
technical
terms
has
also
been
appended
to
the
work
to
which
reference
should
be
made
it
is
recommended
that
the
subject
be
examined
in
the
form
of
the
questions
in
are
designed
for
this
method
of
recitation
the
teacher
may
call
on
a
pupil
of
the
class
to
describe
the
anatomy
of
an
organ
from
an
anatomical
outline
plate
afterwards
call
upon
another
to
give
the
physiology
of
the
part
while
a
third
may
state
the
hygiene
after
which
the
questions
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
may
be
asked
promiscuously
and
thus
the
detailed
knowledge
of
the
subject
possessed
by
the
pupils
will
be
tested
at
the
close
of
the
chapters
upon
the
hygiene
of
the
several
portions
of
the
system
it
is
advised
that
the
instructor
give
a
lecture
reviewing
the
anatomy
physiology
and
hygiene
of
the
topic
last
considered
this
may
be
followed
by
a
general
examination
of
the
class
upon
the
same
subject
by
this
course
a
clear
and
definite
knowledge
of
the
mutual
relation
of
the
anatomy
physiology
and
hygiene
of
different
parts
of
the
human
body
will
be
presented
we
also
suggest
the
utility
of
the
pupils
giving
analogous
illustrations
examples
and
observations
where
these
are
interspersed
in
the
different
chapters
not
only
to
induce
inventive
thought
but
to
discipline
the
mind
to
parents
and
others
we
beg
leave
to
say
that
about
two
thirds
of
the
present
work
is
devoted
to
a
concise
and
practical
description
of
the
uses
of
the
important
organs
of
the
human
body
and
to
show
how
such
information
may
be
usefully
applied
both
in
the
preservation
of
health
and
the
improvement
of
physical
education
to
this
have
been
added
directions
for
the
treatment
of
those
accidents
which
are
daily
occurring
in
the
community
making
it
a
treatise
proper
and
profitable

general
remarks
anatomy
is
the
science
which
treats
of
the
structure
and
relations
of
the
different
parts
of
animals
and
plants
it
is
divided
into
and
anatomy
the
latter
of
these
divisions
is
subdivided
into
anatomy
which
considers
exclusively
human
beings
and
anatomy
which
treats
of
the
mechanism
of
the
lower
orders
of
animals
physiology
treats
of
the
functions
or
uses
of
the
organs
of
animals
and
plants
another
definition
is
the
science
of
life
this
is
also
divided
into
and
physiology
as
it
treats
of
the
vegetable
or
animal
kingdom
and
into
and
physiology
as
it
describes
the
vital
functions
of
man
or
the
inferior
animals
hygiene
is
the
art
or
science
of
maintaining
health
or
a
knowledge
of
those
laws
by
which
health
may
be
preserved
the
kingdom
of
nature
is
divided
into
and
bodies
organic
bodies
possess
organs
on
whose
action
depend
their
growth
and
perfection
this
division
includes
animals
and
plants
inorganic
bodies
are
devoid
of
organs
or
instruments
of
life
in
this
division
are
classed
the
earths
metals
and
other
minerals
what
is
anatomy
how
is
it
divided
how
is
the
latter
division
subdivided
what
is
physiology
give
another
definition
how
is
physiology
divided
give
a
subdivision
what
is
hygiene
define
organic
bodies
in
general
organic
matter
differs
so
materially
from
inorganic
that
the
one
can
readily
be
distinguished
from
the
other
in
the
organic
world
every
individual
of
necessity
springs
from
some
or
immediate
producing
for
while
inorganic
substances
are
formed
by
chemical
laws
alone
we
see
no
case
of
an
animal
or
plant
coming
into
existence
by
accident
or
chance
or
chemical
operations
animals
and
plants
supported
by
means
of
and
die
without
it
they
also
increase
in
size
the
addition
of
new
particles
of
matter
to
all
parts
of
their
while
rocks
and
minerals
grow
only
by
additions
to
their
surfaces
organized
bodies
always
present
a
combination
of
both
solids
and
fluids
of
solids
differing
in
character
and
properties
arranged
into
organs
and
these
endowed
with
functional
powers
and
so
associated
as
to
form
of
the
whole
a
single
system
and
of
fluids
contained
in
these
organs
and
holding
such
relation
to
the
solids
that
the
existence
nature
and
properties
of
both
mutually
and
necessarily
depend
on
each
other
another
characteristic
is
that
organic
substances
have
a
order
of
for
example
plants
possess
organs
to
gain
nourishment
from
the
soil
and
atmosphere
and
the
power
to
give
strength
and
increase
to
all
their
parts
and
animals
need
not
only
a
digesting
and
circulating
apparatus
but
organs
for
breathing
a
nervous
system
define
inorganic
bodies
what
is
said
of
the
difference
in
general
between
organic
and
inorganic
bodies
what
of
the
growth
of
organic
and
inorganic
bodies
what
do
organized
bodies
always
present
give
another
characteristic
of
organized
substances
is
an
important
characteristic
for
instance
a
large
rock
may
be
broken
into
a
number
of
smaller
pieces
and
yet
every
fragment
will
be
rock
but
if
an
organic
substance
be
separated
into
two
or
more
divisions
neither
of
them
can
be
considered
an
individual
closely
associated
with
this
is
the
power
of
or
which
is
the
most
distinguishing
characteristic
of
organic
structure
since
we
find
nothing
similar
to
this
in
the
inorganic
creation
distinction
between
plants
and
is
also
of
much
importance
grow
proportionally
in
all
while
plants
grow
upwards
and
downwards
from
a
collet
only
the
of
animals
is
while
that
of
plants
is
the
latter
feeding
entirely
upon
the
elements
of
the
soil
and
atmosphere
while
the
former
subsist
upon
the
products
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
the
size
of
the
vegetable
is
in
most
cases
limited
only
by
the
duration
of
existence
as
a
tree
continues
to
put
forth
new
branches
during
each
period
of
its
life
while
the
animal
at
a
certain
time
of
life
attains
the
average
size
of
its
species
one
of
the
most
important
distinctions
between
animals
and
plants
is
different
effects
of
animals
consume
the
oxygen
of
the
atmosphere
and
give
off
carbonic
acid
while
plants
take
up
the
carbonic
acid
and
restore
to
animals
the
oxygen
thus
affording
an
admirable
example
of
the
principle
of
compensation
in
nature
but
the
decisive
distinctions
between
animals
and
plants
are
and
the
power
of
acquiring
a
knowledge
of
external
objects
through
the
senses
and
the
ability
to
move
from
place
to
place
at
will
these
are
the
characteristics
which
in
their
fullest
development
in
man
show
intellect
and
reasoning
powers
and
thereby
in
a
greater
degree
exhibit
to
us
the
wisdom
and
goodness
of
the
creator
what
is
said
of
the
individuality
of
organized
and
inorganized
bodies
what
is
closely
associated
with
this
give
a
distinction
between
animals
and
plants
as
regards
growth
the
food
of
animals
and
plants
what
is
said
in
respect
to
size
what
important
distinction
in
the
effects
of
respiration
of
animals
and
plants
what
are
the
decisive
distinctions
between
animals
and
plants
disease
which
consists
in
an
unnatural
condition
of
the
bodily
organs
is
in
most
cases
under
the
control
of
fixed
laws
which
we
are
capable
of
understanding
and
obeying
nor
do
diseases
come
by
chance
they
are
penalties
for
violating
physical
laws
if
we
carelessly
cut
or
bruise
our
flesh
pain
and
soreness
follow
to
induce
us
to
be
more
careful
in
the
future
or
if
we
take
improper
food
into
the
stomach
we
are
warned
perhaps
immediately
by
a
friendly
pain
that
we
have
violated
an
organic
law
sometimes
however
the
penalty
does
not
directly
follow
the
sin
and
it
requires
great
physiological
knowledge
to
be
able
to
trace
the
effect
to
its
true
cause
if
we
possess
good
constitutions
we
are
responsible
for
most
of
our
sickness
and
bad
constitutions
or
hereditary
diseases
are
but
the
results
of
the
same
great
law
the
iniquities
of
the
parents
being
visited
on
the
children
in
this
view
of
the
subject
how
important
is
the
study
of
physiology
and

there
is
a

readily
changed
into

there
is
no
fluid
that
does
not
contain
solid
matter
in

and
no
solid
matter
that
is
destitute
of
fluid
in
different
individuals
and
at
different
periods
of
life
the
proportion
of
fluids
and
solids
varies
in
youth
the
fluids
are
more
abundant
than
in
advanced
life
for
this
reason
the
limbs
in
childhood
are
soft
and
round
while
in
old
age
they
assume
a
hard
and
wrinkled
appearance
the
fluids
not
only
contain
the
materials
from
which
every
part
of
the
body
is
formed
but
they
are
the
medium
for
conveying
the
waste
decayed
particles
of
matter
from
the
system
they
have
various
names
according
to
their
nature
and
function
as
the
blood
and
the
bile
the
solids
are
formed
from
the
fluids
and
consequently
they
are
reduced
by
chemical
analysis
to
the
same
ultimate
elements
the
particles

still
more
remarkable

regard
to

sometimes
when
an
accidental
opening
has
been
made
from

cellular
tissue
the
air
in

has
penetrated

inflated
as
to
occasion
suffocation
butchers
often
avail
themselves
of
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
and
inflate
their
meat
to
give
it
a
fat
appearance
although
this
tissue
enters
into
the
composition
of
all
organs
it
never
loses
its
own
structure
nor
participates
in
the
functions
of
the
organ
of
which
it
forms
a
part
though
present
in

it
does
not

this

is
continuous
with
the
mucous
at
the
various
orifices
of
the
body
and
in
these
situations
from
the
similarity
of
their
structure
it
is
difficult
to
distinguish
between
them
in
consequence
of
the
continuity

there

membranes
if

of

the

of
the

by
their
solidity
and
form
they
not
only
retain
every
part
of
the
fabric
in
its

but
afford
a
firm
surface
for
the
attachment
of
the
muscles
and
ligaments
by
means
of
the
bones
the
human
frame
presents
to
the
eye
a
wonderful
piece
of
mechanism
uniting
the
most
finished
symmetry
of
form
with
freedom
of
motion
and
also
giving
security
to
many
important
organs
to
give
a
clear
idea
of
the
relative
uses
of
the
bones
and
muscles
we
will
quote
the
comparison
of
another
though
as
in
other
comparisons
there
are
points
of
difference
the
bones
are
to
the
body
what
the
masts
and
spars
are
to
the
ship
they
give
support
and
the
power
of
resistance
the
muscles
are
to
the
bones
what
the
ropes
are
to
the
masts
and
spars
the
bones
are
the
levers
of
the
system
by
the
action
of
the
muscles
their
relative
positions
are
changed
as
the
masts
and
spars
of
a
vessel
must
be
sufficiently
firm
to
sustain
the
action
of
the
ropes
so
the
bones
must
possess
the
same
quality
to
sustain
the
action
of
the
muscles
in
the
human
body
some
of
the
bones
are
designed
exclusively
for
the
protection
of
the
organs
which
they
enclose
of
this
number
are
those
that
form
the

and
the

others
in

to
the
protection
they
give
to
important

are
useful
in

of
certain
kinds
of
this
class
are
the
bones
of
the
spinal
column

others
are

the
physiology
of
the
how
may
the
bones
be
considered
to
what
may
the
bones
be
compared
give
the
different
offices
of
the
bones
the
bones
are
subject
to
growth
and
decay
to
removal
of
old
useless
matter
and
the
deposit
of
new
particles
as
in
other
tissues
this
has
been
tested
by
the
following
experiment
some
of
the
inferior
animals
were
fed
with
food
that
contained
madder
in
a
few
days
some
of
the
animals
were
killed
and
their
bones
exhibited
an
unusually
reddish
appearance
the
remainder
of
the
animals
were
for
a
few
weeks
fed
on
food
that
contained
no
coloring
principle
when
they
were
killed
their
bones
exhibited
the
usual
color
of
such
animals
the
coloring
matter
which
had
been
deposited
had
been
removed
by
the
action
of
the
lymphatics
the
extremities
of
the
bones
that
concur
in
forming
a
joint
correspond
by
having
their
respective
configurations
reciprocal
they
are
in
general
the
one
convex
and
the
other
concave
in
texture
they
are
porous
and
consequently
more
elastic
than
if
more
compact
these
are
covered
with
a
cushion
of
cartilage
the
elastic
character
of
these
parts
acts
as
so
many
springs
in
diminishing
the
jar
which
important
organs
of
the
system
would
otherwise
receive
the
synovial
membrane
secretes
a
viscous
fluid
which
is
called
this
lubricating
fluid
of
the
joints
enables
the
surfaces
of
the
bones
and
tendons
to
move
smoothly
upon
each
other
thus
diminishing
the
friction
consequent
on
their
action
in
this
secretion
is
manifested
the
skill
and
omnipotence
of
the
great
architect
for
no
machine
of
human
invention
supplies
to
itself
by
its
own
operations
the
necessary
lubricating
fluid
but
in
the
animal

should
be
in

also
in
adults
the

are
very
flexible

will
increase
their

again
the
cartilages
on

side
may
be
bent
outward

those
on

movable
extremities
of

are
drawn
down
toward

while
the
space
between
the
ribs
is
lessened
all
this
may
be
effected
by
tight
or
snug
clothing
therefore
the
apparel
of
a
child
should
be
loose

supported
over
the
shoulders
to
avoid
the
evils
the
same
may
be
said
of

clothing
for
adults
erect
position
in

standing
should
be
assiduously
the
spinal
column
in
its
natural
position
curves
from
front
to
back
but
not
from
side
to
side
the
admirable
arrangement
of
the
bones
alternating
with
cartilages
permits
a
great
variety
of
motions
and
positions
and
when
the
spine
is
inclined
to
either
side
the
elasticity
of
its
cartilages
tends
to
restore
it
to
its
natural
position
for
this
reason
we
may
incline
the
spinal
column
in
any
direction
for
a
short
time
without
danger
of
permanent
curvature
if
afterward
the
erect
position
is
assumed
compare
fig
with
fig
but
if
a
stooping
position
or
a
lateral
curved
posture
is
continued
for
a
long
time
the
spinal
column
does
not
easily
recover
its
proper
position
for
the
compressed
edges
of
the
cartilages
lose
their
power
of
reaction
and
finally
one
side
of
the
cartilage
becomes
thinned
while
the
other
is
thickened
and
these
cartilages
produce
a
permanent
curvature
of
the
spinal
column
in
a
similar
way
the
student
seamstress
artisan
and
mechanic
acquire
a
stooping
position
and
become
round
shouldered

inclining
forward

that

from
the
blood
in
young
persons
it
may
be
secreted
during
the
second
or
third
week
and
in
individuals
advanced
in
life
usually
during
the
third
and
fourth
week
when
the
bone
is
uniting
during
the
second
third
or
fourth
week
the
attention
of
a
surgeon
is
more
needed
than
during
the
first
week
at
this
time
the
ends
of
the
bone
should
be
placed
together
with
accuracy
which
requires
the
careful
application
of
proper
dressing
after
the
bones
have
united
it
will
take
some
weeks
to
consolidate
the
uniting
material
and
render
the
callus
or
union
firm
during
this
time
the
limb
should
be
used
with
care
when
a
bone
is
fractured
a
surgeon
is
immediately
called
and
the
bone
is
set
while
the
limb
remains
swelled
and
painful
the
surgeon
is
required
to
attend
and
keep
the
dressings
bandages
and
splints
on
when
the
swelling
has
abated
and
the
pain
subsided
frequently
the
patient
intimates
to
the
surgeon
that
his
services
can
be
dispensed
with
as
the
limb
is
doing
well
this
is
the
most
important
period
as
the
bone
is
uniting
and
unless
the
ends
are
nicely
adjusted
the
dressing
properly
applied
the
person
will
find
on
recovery
a
shortened

crooked
limb
the

is
then
censured

what

vary
when

of

most
needed
why
it
is
seldom
that
a

is
displaced
without
injury
to
the
connecting
ligaments

adviser
in

but
few
if
any
of
the
fibres
of
the
connecting
ligaments
are
lacerated
but
they
are
unduly
strained
and
twisted
which
occasions
acute
pain
at
the
time
of
the
injury
this
is
followed
by
inflammation
and
weakness
of
the
joints
the
treatment
of
these
injuries
is
similar
to
that
of
a
dislocated
bone
after
its
reduction
the
most
important
item
in
the
treatment
during
the
few
first

is
rest
in
persons
of

in
whom
the

the
muscles
all
the
great
motions
of
the
body
are
caused
by
the
movement
of
some
of
the
bones
which
form
the
framework
of
the
system
but
these
independently
of
themselves
have
not
the
power
of
motion
and
only
change
their
position
through
the
action
of
other
organs
attached
to
them
which
by
contracting
draw
the
bones
after
them
in
some
of
the
slight
movements
as
the
winking
of
the
eye
no
bones
are
displaced
these

the

constitute
the
great
bulk
of
the
body
upon
which
they
bestow
form
and
symmetry
in
the
limbs
they
are
situated
around
the
bones
which
they
invest
and
defend
while
they
form
to
some
of
the
joints
their
principal
protection
in
the
trunk
they
are
spread
out
to
enclose
cavities
and
constitute
a
defensive
wall
capable
of
yielding
to
internal
pressure
and
reassuming
its
original
state
in

a
muscle
is
composed
of
bundles
of
fibres
of
variable
size
these
are
enclosed
in
a
cellular
membranous
investment
or
sheath
every
bundle
composed
of
a

of
small
fibres
and
each
fibre
consists
of
a

of
filaments
each
of
which
is
enclosed
in
a
delicate
sheath
toward
the
extremity
of
the
organ
the
muscular
fibre
ceases
and
the
cellular
structure
becomes
aggregated
and
so
modified
as
to
constitute
cords
by
which
the
muscle
is
tied
to
the
surface
of
the
bone
the
union
is
so
firm
that
under
extreme
violence
the
bone
will
sooner
break
than
permit
the
tendon
to

in

each

muscles
receives
from
the
brain
through
the
nervous
filament
appropriated

it
a
certain
influence
called
nervous
fluid

stimulus
it
is
this
that
induces
contraction
while

causes
relaxation
of

fibres
by
this
arrangement
the
action
of
the
muscular
system
both
as
regards
duration
and
power
is
to
a
limited
extent
under
the
control
of
the
mind
the
more
perfect
the
control
the
better
the
education
of
the
muscular
system
as
is
seen
in
the
graceful
effective
and
movements
of
musicians
dancers
skaters
the
length
of
time
which
a
muscle
may
remain
contracted
varies
the
duration
of
the
contraction
of
the
voluntary
muscles
in
some
measure
is
in
an
inverse
ratio
to
its
force
if
a
muscle
has
contracted
with
violence
as
when
great
effort
is
made
to
raise
a
heavy
weight
relaxation
will
follow
sooner
than
when
the
contraction
has
been
less
powerful
as
in
raising
light
bodies
the
velocity
of
the
muscular
contraction
depends
on
the
will
many
of
the
voluntary
muscles
in
man
contract
with
great
rapidity
so
that
he
is
enabled
to
utter
distinctly
fifteen
hundred
letters
in
a
minute
the
pronunciation
of
each
letter
requiring
both
relaxation
and
contraction
of
the
same
muscle
thus
making
three
thousand
actions
in
one
minute
but
the
contraction
of
the
muscles
of
some
of
the
inferior
animals
surpasses
in
rapidity
those
of
man
the
it
is
said
has
run
a
mile
in
a
minute
and
many
birds
of
prey
will
probably
pass
not
less
than
a
thousand
miles
daily
give
experiment
with
what
is
each
muscular
fibre
supplied
what
effect
has
this
stimulus
on
the
muscles
how
long
does
a
voluntary
muscle
remain
contracted
on
what
is
the
velocity
of
muscular
contraction
dependent
how
many
letters
may
be
pronounced
in
a
minute
the
functions
of
the
involuntary
muscles
are
necessary
the
digestion
of
food
the
absorption
and
circulation
of
the
nutritive
fluids
they
could
not
be
trusted
with
safety
to
the
control
of
the
will
lest
the
passions
or
the
indiscretions
of
the
person
should
continually
avert
those
operations
so
necessary
to
health
and
even
to
life
the
divine
builder
of
this
complicated
machine
has
wisely
ordered
that
the
muscles
upon
which
these
motions
depend
shall
act
under
the
impression
of
their
proper
stimulants
without
the
control
of
the
individual
again
there
are
certain
operations
which
could
not
be
safely
intrusted
to
the
absolute
government
of
the
voluntary
muscles
or
entirely
removed
from
their
control
thus
life
can
be
supported
only
a
few
minutes
without
breathing
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
perform
the
daily
vocations
of
life
if
we
were
compelled
to
breathe
at
all
times
or
at
perfectly
regular
intervals
it
has
been
observed
that
among
men
of
the
same
size
a
wide
difference
exists
in
their
strength
and
activity
qualities
which
depend
upon
the
size
and
number
of
the
nerves
the
size
and
activity
of
the
brain
and
the
education
or
training
of
the
muscles
men
having
large
nerves
leading
to
the
muscles
with
the
brain
active
and
muscles
well
trained
will
perform
feats
of
strength
and
agility
that
other
men
of
the
same
size
can
not
effect
harlequins
and
other
performers
of
feats
are
persons
thus
constituted
how
many
contractions
and
relaxations
of
the
same
muscle
what
is
said
of
the
rapidity
of
muscular
contractions
in
other
animals
when
are
the
involuntary
muscles
called
into
action
why
would
it
not
have
been
safe
to
trust
these
important
operations
to
the
exclusive
control
of
the
will
give
an
instance
where
some
of
the
muscles
act
under
the
government
of
the
will
conjoined
with
those
that
are
involuntary
on
what
does
the
difference
in
muscular
activity
and
strength
depend
persons
with
small
muscles
and
largely
developed
nervous
systems
will
sometimes
exhibit
very
great
muscular
power
for
a
time
but
it
will
not
be
of
long
continuance
unless
the
brain
is
functionally
diseased
as
in
hysteria
delirium
of
fever
insanity
men
of
large
muscles
and
small
nerves
can
never
perform
feats
of
great
strength
but
they
have
the
power
of
endurance
and
are
better
capacitated
for
continued
labor
thus
we
can
not
judge
of
the
ability
of
persons
to
make
exertions
and
continue
them
by
their
stature
alone
strength
and
the
power
of
endurance
are
the
result
of
a
combination
of
muscles
large
nerves
and
a
healthy
and
active
brain
the
muscles
of
fishes
are
large
and
the
nerves
distributed
to
them
comparatively
small
the
muscles
of
birds
are
small
but
their
fibres
are
very
compact
the
nerves
appropriated
to
the
muscles
that
are
called
into
action
in
flying
are
large
as
well
as
numerous
the
contractile
portion
of
a
muscle
is
in
general
at
a
distance
from
the
part
to
be
moved
thus
the
principal
muscles
that
move
the
fingers
are
situated
upon
the
forearm
and
when
the
limb
is
nearly
or
quite
extended
the
angle
formed
by
the
part
to
be
moved
and
the
contractile
muscles
is
small
again
the
attachment
of
the
muscles
to
the
part
to
be
moved
is
near
the
joint
that
forms
the
fulcrum
fig
by
these
arrangements
there
is
a
loss
of
power
but
we
are
compensated
for
this
disadvantage
by
increased
celerity
of
movement
beauty
of
form
and
adaptation
of
the
limbs
to
the
varied
pursuits
of
man
what
is
said
of
those
persons
who
have
small
muscles
and
largely
developed
nervous
systems
of
those
who
have
large
muscles
and
small
nerves
upon
what
do
strength
and
the
power
of
endurance
depend
why
is
there
a
loss
of
power
in
the
action
of
the
muscles
the
muscle
that
bends
the
elbow
acts
at
disadvantage
and
this
is
greatest
when
the
arm
is
nearly
or
quite
extended
as
the
angle
of
action
is
then
least
this
disadvantage
is
further
increased
by
the
attachment
of
the
motive
muscles
near
the
joint
the
number
of
muscles
which
are
called
into
action
in
the
movements
of
the
different
joints
varies
the
as
the
elbow
have
two
sets
of
muscles
one
to
bend
the
joint
the
other
to
extend
it
the
ball
and
socket
joints
as
the
shoulder
are
not
limited
to
mere
flexion
and
extension
no
joint
in
the
system
has
the
range
of
movement
that
is
possessed
by
that
of
the
shoulder
by
the
action
of
the
muscles
attached
to
the
arm
it
is
not
only
carried
upward
and
forward
but
forward
and
backward
hence
the
arm
may
be
moved
at
any
angle
by
a
combined
action
of
its
muscles
could
we
behold
properly
the
muscular
fibres
in
operation
nothing
as
a
mere
mechanical
exhibition
can
be
conceived
more
superb
than
the
intricate
and
combined
actions
that
must
take
place
during
our
most
common
movements

at
a

running

watch
the
motions
of
the
eye
how
rapid
how
delicate
how
complicated
and
yet
how
accurate
are
the
motions
required
think
of
the
endurance
of
such
a
muscle
as
the
heart
that
can
contract
with
a
force
equal
to
sixty
pounds
times
every
minute
for
eighty
years
together
without
being
weary
it
would
be
a
profitable
exercise
for
pupils
to
press
their
fingers
upon
prominent
muscles

vigorously
contract
them
not

their
situations

their

that
the

may
be

that
the

and
power
of
an
organ
are
commensurate
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
demand
made
upon

and
it
is
a
law
of
the
muscular
system
that
whenever
a
muscle
is
called
into
frequent
use
its
fibres
increase
in
thickness
within
certain
limits
and
become
capable
of
acting
with

the

decreases

the

they

they

let
the

leave
his

and
wield
an
iron
sledge
and
the
muscles
of
his
arm
will
increase
in

and
firmness
on
the
other

let
the
blacksmith
assume
the
student
vocation
and
the
muscles
of
his

the

called
into

the

in

both

show
this
by
practical
illustrations
why
do

increase
in
size
when
exercised
muscles
are
lessened
in

and
diminished
in
power
when
the
exercise
is
continued
so
as
to
produce
a

of
the

in
this

will
exceed
the
deposition
of
the

of

this
is
seen
in
the
attenuated
frames
of
domestic
animals
as
the
horse
the
same
truth
is
illustrated
by
the
laborious
agriculturist
who
in
consequence
of
too
severe
toil
while
gathering
the
products
of
the
field
frequently
diminishes
his

several
pounds
in
a
few
weeks

for

it
should
never
be
protracted
to
languor
or
exhaustion
if
the
individual
desires
a
green
old
age
same
amount
of
exercise
will
not
conduce
to
the
health
of
all
if
riding
or
walking
one
mile
causes
slight
fatigue
this
may
be
beneficial
while
by
travelling
two

the

may
be
highly
injurious
exercise
and
labor
should
be
adapted
to
the
strength
of
particular
individuals
how
little
soever
the
strength
that
must
be
the
measure
of
exertion
any
other
rule
would
be
fatal
to
the
hopes
of
invigorating
the

either
by
exercise
or

is
there
a
limit
to
the

becoming
powerful
by

how
may
the
strength
of

be
kept
until
advanced
age
what
is
the

what
rule
is

in

all
persons
take
the

what
rule
is
given
as
to
the
amount
of
exercise
must
follow
contraction
or
in
other
words
rest
must
follow
the
necessity
of
relaxation
when
a
muscle
has
been
called
into
action
is
seen
in
the
example
of
a
boy
extending
his

with
a

in
his

as
a
penalty
the
boy
can
keep
the

it
is
also

in
the

that
are
evinced
by
persons
gazing
on

during
days
of

the

is
noted
in

such
employments
call
into
action
the
muscles
that
support
the
spinal
column
in
an
erect
position
and
the
languor
or
uneasiness
is
muscular
pain
the
tension
of
a
muscle
enfeebles
its
action
and
eventually
destroys
its
contractility
school
the
small
children
after

time
become
if
their
position
be
changed
their
imperfectly
developed
muscles
will
acquire
tone
and
will
again
support
the
spinal
column
erect
without
pain
the
necessity
for
frequent
recesses
in
school
is
founded
on
the
organic
law
of
muscular
action
alternating
with
rest
the
younger
and
feebler
pupils
are
the
greater
the
necessity
for
frequent
recesses
we
would
not
have
the
teacher
think
that
one
half
of
the
time
should
be
spent
in
recesses
or
the
mother
that
her
daughter
is
going
to
school
to
play
but
we
do
maintain
that
recesses
should
be
given
and
that
they
should
be
short
and
frequent
especially
for
small
and
feeble
scholars
is
the
inevitable
result
of
continued
muscular
for
example
let
a
lady
ply
the
needle
quickly
for
some
hours
and
the
muscles
of
the
back
and
right
arm
will
become
exhausted
which
will
be
indicated
by
a
sense
of
weariness
in
these
parts
a
change
of
employment
and
position
calls
into
action
a
different
set
of
muscles
and
the
exhausted
organs
are
relieved
what
is
said
of
the
contraction
and
relaxation
of
the
muscles
give
examples
of
the
necessity
of
relaxing
the
muscles
why
should
not
small
children
be
confined
in
one
position
for
a
long
time
what
evils
result
from
this
practice
what
class
of
pupils
should
have
recesses
most
frequently
what
effect
has
continued
muscular
contraction
more
labor
will
be
accomplished
by
taking
time
to
relax
the
exhausted
or
by
so
changing
the
employment
as
to
bring
into
action
a
new
set
of
muscles
the
woodman
thus
relieves
himself
by
sawing
and
splitting
alternately
this
principle
applies
to
the
labor
of
the
horse
and
ox
and
it
is
also
applicable
to
all
kinds
of
employment
with
the
invalid
convalescing
from
fever
relapses
result
from
inattention
to
these
laws
when
a
patient
is
recovering
from
sickness
his
physician
should
take
care
that
his
exercise
be
proper
neither
too
much
too
little
nor
too
long
continued
muscles
of
growing
youths
will
not
endure
so
much
exercise
or
labor
as
those
of
mature
in
youth
a
portion
of
the
vital
or
nervous
energy
of
the
system
is
expended
upon
the
growth
of
the
organs
of
the
body
while
in
the
individual
who
has
attained
his
growth
this
expenditure
is
not
demanded
consequently
severe
labor
or
exercise
should
not
be
imposed
on
growing
children
in
the
campaigns
of
napoleon
bonaparte
his
army
was
frequently
recruited
by
mere
boys
he
complained
to
the
french
government
because
he
was
not
supplied
with
men
of
mature
years
as
the
youths
could
not
endure
the
exertion
of
his
forced
marches
muscles
should
be
gradually
called
into
these
organs
in
action
require
more
blood
and
nervous
fluid
than
when
at
rest
as
the
circulation
of
these
fluids
can
only
be
increased
in
a
gradual
manner
it
follows
that
when
the
muscular
system
has
been
in
a
state
of
rest
it
should
not
suddenly
be
called
into
vigorous
action
on
arising
from
a
bed
lounge
or
chair
the
first
movements
of
the
limbs
should
be
slow
and
then
gradually
increased
if
a
man
has
a
certain
amount
of
work
to
perform
in
nine
hours
and
his
muscles
have
been
in
a
state
of
rest
he
will
do
it
with
less
fatigue
by
performing
half
the
amount
of
the
labor
in
five
hours
and
the
remainder
in
four
hours
the
same
principle
should
be
regarded
in
driving
horses
and
other
beasts
of
burden
how
can
the
greatest
amount
of
labor
be
secured
with
the
least
exhaustion
to
the
muscles
why
should
not
severe
labor
be
imposed
on
growing
children
how
should
the
muscles
be
called
into
action
muscles
should
be
rested
gradually
when
they
have
been
vigorously
if
a
person
has
been
making
great
muscular
exertion
in
cutting
wood
or
any
other
employment
instead
of
sitting
down
to
rest
he
should
continue
muscular
action
for
a
short
time
by
some
moderate
labor
or
amusement
the
system
has
been
heated
by
muscular
action
and
the
skin
is
covered
with
perspiration
avoid
sitting
to
cool
in
a
current
of
air
rather
put
on
more
clothing
and
continue
to
exercise
moderately
in
instances
when
severe
action
of
the
muscles
has
been
endured
bathing
and
rubbing
the
skin
of
the
limbs
and
joints
that
have
been
used
are
of
much
importance
the
laboring
agriculturist
and
industrious
mechanic
by
reducing
to
practice
this
suggestion
would
thus
prevent
soreness
of
the
muscles
and
stiffness
of
the
joints
muscles
should
be
abundantly
supplied
with
pure
this
state
of
the
circulating
fluid
requires
a
healthy
condition
of
the
digestive
apparatus
and
that
the
skin
should
be
kept
warm
by
proper
clothing
clean
by
bathing
and
be
acted
upon
by
pure
air
and
good
light
the
movements
of
the
ribs
and
diaphragm
should
be
unrestricted
and
the
lungs
should
have
ample
volume
and
be
supplied
with
pure
air
in
all
instances
muscular
power
is
greatest
when
the
preceding
conditions
exist
as
the
muscles
are
then
stimulated
by
pure
blood
consequently
it
is
of
practical
importance
to
the
mechanic
the
farmer
the
man
of
leisure
and
not
less
so
to
the
ladies
to
observe
these
conditions
whatever
vocation
of
life
they
pursue
how
should
the
muscles
be
rested
when
they
have
been
vigorously
used
what
precaution
is
given
when
the
skin
is
covered
with
perspiration
how
may
soreness
of
the
muscles
consequent
upon
severe
action
be
prevented
should
the
muscles
be
supplied
with
pure

when

the
greatest
muscles
should
be
used
in
pure
the
purer
the
air
we
breathe
the
more
stimulating
the
blood
supplied
to
the
muscles
and
the
longer
they
can
be
used
in
labor
walking
or
sitting
without
fatigue
and
injury
hence
the
benefit
derived
in
thoroughly
ventilating
all
inhabited
rooms
for
the
same
reason
if
the
air
of
the

pure
the
patient
will
sit
up
longer
than
when
the
air
is
impure
it
is
a
common
remark
that
sick
persons
will
sit
up
longer
when
riding
in
a
carriage
than
in
an
easy
chair
in
the
room
where
they
have
lain
sick
in

one
instance
they
breathe

in

in

that

the
inferior
animals

as

both
require
the

kitchens

be
well
lighted
and
situated
on
the
sunny

of
the

cellar
kitchens
and
underground
shops
should
be
avoided
for
similar
reasons
students
should
take
their
exercise
during
the
day
rather
than
in
the
evening
and
as
much
as
possible
laborers
should
avoid
night
toil
plants
that
grow
in
the
shade
as

are
of
lighter

and
feebler
than
those

why

what

as

does
new

it
is
no
more
correct
that
we
devote
several

to
a

and
then
spend

inactively
than
it
is
to
take
a

for
several
days
and
then
withdraw
this

for
a
day
the
industrious

and
the
studious

suffer
as
surely
from
undue
confinement
as
the
improvident
and
indolent
the
evil
consequences
of
neglect
of
exercise
are
gradual
and
steal
slowly
upon
an
individual
but
sooner
or
later
they
are
manifested
in
muscular
weakness
dyspepsia
and
nervous
irritability
the
custom
among
farmers
of
enduring
severe
and
undue
toil
for
several
successive
days
and
then
spending
one
or
two
days
in
idleness
to
is
injudicious
it
would
be
far
better
to
do
less
in
a
day
and
continue
the
labor
through
the
period
devoted
to
idleness
and
then
no
rest
will
be
demanded
part
of
the
muscular
system
should
have
its
appropriate
share
of
some
employments
call
into
exercise
the
muscles
of
the
upper
limbs
as
others
the
muscles
of
the
lower
limbs
while
some
the
muscles
of
both
upper
and
lower
limbs
with
those
of
the
trunk
as
farming
in
some
kinds
of
exercise
the
lower
limbs
are
mainly
used
as
in
walking
in
others
the
upper
limbs
and
again
the
muscles
of
the
trunk
together
with
those
of
the
upper
and
lower
limbs
as
in
archery
quoits
playing
ball
those
trades
and
kinds
of
exercise
are
most
salutary
in
which
all
the
muscles
have
their
due
proportion
of
action
as
this
tends
to
develop
and
strengthen
them
equally
thus
labor
upon
the
farm
and
domestic
employment
are
superior
as
vocations
and
archery
quoits
and
dancing
if
the
air
is
pure
among
the
pastimes
for
sedentary
persons
that
kind
of
exercise
is
best
which
calls
into
action
the
greatest
number
of
muscles
how
should
exercise
be
taken
what
is
said
respecting
irregular
exercise
are
the
consequences
of
neglected
exercise
immediately
apparent
what
practical
observation
is
given
should
every
muscle
have
its
due
amount
of
exercise
mention
some
employments
that
only
call
into
action
the
muscles
of
the
upper
limbs
those
of
the
lower
limbs
those
of
the
trunk
and
limbs
mention
in
the
different
pastimes
what
muscles
are
called
into
action
proper
time
for
labor
or
exercise
should
be
this
is
modified
by
many
circumstances
as
a
general
rule
the
morning
when
the
air
is
pure
and
the
ground
dry
is
better
than
the
evening
for
then
the
powers
of
the
body
are
greatest
severe
exercise
and
labor
should
be
avoided
immediately
before
or
after
eating
a
full
meal
for
the
energies
of
the
system
are
then
required
to
perform
the
digestive
function
for
similar
reasons
it
is
not
an
appropriate
time
for
energetic
muscular
action
immediately
before
or
after
severe
mental
toil
as
the
powers
of
the
system
are
then
concentrated
upon
the
brain
it
appears
to
be
a
fact
that
no
two
important
organs
can
be
called
into
intense
action
at
the
same
time
without
injury
to
both
as
well
as
to
the
general
system
this
arises
from
the

an

a

will
become

again
if

his
wearied

are

he

give
an
illustration
of
mental
stimulus
coöperating
with
muscular
activity
in
the
case
of
a
sportsman
this
principle
was
well
illustrated
in
the
retreat
from
russia
of
the
defeated
and
dispirited
french
army
when
no
enemy
was
near
they
had
hardly
strength
sufficient
to
carry
their
arms
but
no
sooner
did
they
hear
the
report
of
the
russian
guns
than
new
life
seemed
to
pervade
them
and
they
wielded
their
weapons
powerfully
until
the
foe
was
repulsed
then
there
was
a
relapse
to
weakness
and
prostration
followed
it
is
thus
with
the
invalid
when
riding
for
his
health
relate
an
anecdote
or
excite
this
mental
stimulus
by
agreeable
conversation
and
much
benefit
will
accrue
from
the
ride
to
the
debilitated
person
so
it
is
in
the
daily
vocations
of
life
if
the
mind
have
some
incentive
the
tiresomeness
of

will
be
greatly
diminished
let
an
air
of
cheerfulness
ever
pervade
our
every
employment
and
like

sweetens

facts
illustrative
of
the
inutility
of
calling
the
muscles
into
action
without
the
coöperation
of
the
mind
are
seen
in
the
spiritless
aspect
of
many
of
our
boarding
school
processions
when
a
walk
is
taken
merely
for
exercise
without
having
in
view
any
attainable
object
but
present
to
the
mind
a
botanical
or
geological
excursion
and
the
saunter
will
be
exchanged
for
the
elastic
step
the
inanimate
appearance
for
the
bright
eye
and
glowing
cheek
the
difference
is
simply
that
in
the
former
case
the
muscles
are
obliged
to
work
without
that
full
nervous
impulse
so
essential
to
their
energetic
action
and
that
in
the
latter
the
nervous
influence
is
in
full
and
harmonious
operation

how
can
a

be
beneficial

those
who

an

of
the
different
effects
produced
by
the
absence

must
not
however
be
supposed
that
a
walk
simply
for
the
sake
of

can
never
be
beneficial
every

it

continued

of
the
a

whose

stand

walk
further
and
perform
more

than
an
individual
whose
position
is
stooping
but
equal
in
all
other
respects
the
manly
port
in
an
erect
attitude
depends
chiefly
upon
the
action
of
the
muscles
of
the
back
and
it
follows
that
the
fewer
the
muscles
in
a
state
of
tension
the
less
the
draught
upon
the
nervous
system
and
the
less
its
exhaustion
another
advantage
which
attends
the
erect
position
is
the
trunk
and
head
are
balanced
upon
the
bones
and
cartilages
of
the
spinal
column
if
the
body
slightly
incline
forward
the
muscles
attached
to
the
posterior
side
of
the
spine
by
a
gentle
contraction
will
bring
it
to
the
perpendicular
and
even
incline
it
backward
this
is
immediately
removed
by
a
slight
contraction
of
the
muscles
upon
the
anterior
side
of
the
spinal
column
in
the
erect
position
there
is
a
constant
slight
oscillation
of
the
body
backward
and
forward
like
the
movement
of
a
pendulum
while
in
the
stooping
posture
the
muscles
on
the
posterior
side
of
the
spinal
column
are
kept
in
a
state
of
continued
tension
and
contraction
to
prevent
the
body
from
falling
forward
this
enfeebles
the
muscles
of
the
back
and
exhausts
the
nervous
energy
while
the
erect
position
favors
their
development
and
power
because
there
is
an
alternate
contraction
and
relaxation
of
the
muscles
again
in
the
stooping
position
the
lower
limbs
are
curved
at
the
knee
in
this
attitude
there
is
a
constant
tension
of
the
muscles
of
the
lower
extremities
which
produces
muscular
exhaustion
why
will
a
person
who
stands
erect
walk
further
and
perform
more
labor
than
if
he
assumed
the
stooping
posture
why
are
the

so
soon
exhausted

will
be

the

observation
describe
how
the

in

stomach
is
converted
into
chyme
when
the
food
reaches
the
stomach
the
gastric
glands
are
excited
to
action
and
they
secrete
a
powerful
solvent
called
gastric
juice
the
presence
of

in
the

also
increases
a
contractile
action
of
the
muscular
coat
by
which
the
position
of
the
food
is
changed
from
one
part
of
this
cavity
to
another
thus
the
aliment
is
brought
in
contact
with
the
mucous
membrane
and
each
portion
of
it
becomes
saturated
with
gastric
juice
by
which
it
is
softened
or
dissolved
into
a
pulpy
homogeneous
mass
of
a
creamy
consistence
called
the
food
is
not
all
converted

chyme
at
the

time
but
as
fast
as
it
is
changed
it
passes
through
the
pyloric
orifice
into
the
duodenum
the
gastric
juice
has
the
property
of
coagulating
liquid
albuminous
matter

the

the

the
bile

fluid
are
conveyed
into

no
bile
is
found
in
it
the
common
belief
that
the
stomach
has
a
redundancy
of
this
secretion
is
erroneous
if
bile
is
ejected
in
vomiting
it
merely
shows
not
only
that
the
action
of
the
stomach
is
inverted
but
also
that
of

a
powerful
emetic
will
in
this
way

child
and
youth
require
food
to
promote
the
growth
of
the
different
parts
of
the
the
more
rapid
the
growth
of
the
child
the
greater
the
demand
for
food
this
accounts
for
the
keen
appetite
and
vigorous
digestion
in
childhood
when
the
youth
has
attained
his
full
growth
this
necessity
for
nutriment
ceases
after
this
period
of
life
if
the
same
amount
of
food
is
taken
and
there
is
no
increase
of
labor
or
exertion
the
digestive
apparatus
will
become
diseased
and
the
vigor
of
the
whole
system
diminished
when
the
body
has
become
emaciated
from
want
of
nutriment
either
from
famine
or
disease
there
is
an
increased
demand
for
food
this
may
be
gratified
with
impunity
until
the
individual
has
regained

when
an
individual
increases
his
exercise

from

to
severe
labor
or
the
inactive
and
sedentary

journeys
for
pleasure
the
fluids
of
the
system
circulate
with
increased
energy
the
old
and
exhausted
particles
of
matter
are
more
rapidly
removed
through
the
action
of
the
vessels
of
the
skin
lungs
kidneys
and
other
organs
and
their
places
are
filled
with
new
atoms
deposited
by
the
small
as
the
chyle
supplies
the
blood
with
the
newly
vitalized
particles
of
matter
there
is
consequently
an
increased
demand
for
food
this
want
of
the
system
induces
in
general
a
sensation
of
hunger
or
appetite
which
may
be
regarded
as
an
indication
of
the
general
state
of
the
body
the
sympathy
that
exists
throughout
the
system
accords
to
the
stomach
the
power
of
making
known
this
state
to
the
nervous
system
and
if
the
functions
of
this
faithful
monitor
have
not
been
impaired
by
disease
abuse
or
habit
the
call
is
imperious
and
should
be
regarded
at
what
age
is
the
appetite
keen
and
the
digestion
vigorous
why
what
is
said
in
regard
to
the
quantity
of
food
when
the
youth
has
attained
his
growth
what
exception
as
given
in
the
observation
give
another
demand
for
food
what
effect
has
increased
exercise
upon
the
system
how
are
the
new
particles
of
matter
supplied
what
does
this
induce
exercise
or
labor
is
lessened
the
quantity
of
food
should
be
when
a
person
who
has
been
accustomed
to
active
exercise
or
even
hard
manual
labor
suddenly
changes
to
an
employment
that
demands
less
activity
the
waste
attendant
on
action
will
be
diminished
in
a
corresponding
degree
hence
the
quantity
of
food
should
be
lessened
in
nearly
the
same
proportion
as
the
amount
of
exercise
is
diminished
if
this
principle
be
disregarded
the
tone
of
the
digestive
organs
will
be
impaired
and
the
health
of
the
system
enfeebled
this
remark
is
applicable
to
those
students
who
have
left
laborious
employments
to
attend
school
although
the
health
is
firm
and
the
appetite
keen
from
habit
yet
every
pupil
should
practise
some
and
not
eat
as
much
as
the
appetite
craves
the
first
week
of
the
session
after
some
days
the
real
wants
of
the
system
will
generally
be
manifested
by
a
corresponding
sensation
of
hunger
it
is
a
common
observation
that
in
academies
and
colleges
the
older
students
from
the
country
who
have
been
accustomed
to
hard
manual
labor
suffer
more
frequently
from
defective
digestion
and
impaired
health
than
the
younger
and
feebler
students
from
the
larger
towns
and
cities
is
essential
in
maintaining
a
proper
temperature
of
the
the

least
in
part

produced
in
the
minute
vessels
of
the
several
organs

the
union
of
oxygen
with
carbon
and
hydrogen
which
the
food
and
drink
contain
the
amount
of
heat
generated
is
greatest
when
it
is
most
rapidly
removed
from
the
system
which
occurs
in
cold
weather
this
is
the
cause
of
the
system
requiring
more
food
in
winter
than
summer
why
should
the
quantity
of
food
be
diminished
when
the
exercise
is
lessened
what
effect
if
this
principle
be
disregarded
to
what
class
is
this
remark
applicable
what
is
often
observed
among
students
in
academies
and
colleges
state
another
demand
for
food
what
is
one
source
of
heat
in
the
body
persons
that
do
not
have
food
sufficient
for
the
natural
wants
of
the
system
require
more
clothing
than
those
who
are
well
fed
the
principle
plainly
indicates
the
propriety
and
necessity
of
lessening
the
quantity
of
food
as
the
warm
season
approaches
were
this
practised
the
tone
of
the
stomach
and
the
vigor
of
the
system
would
continue
unimpaired
the
season
complaints
would
be
avoided
and
the
strengthening
bitters
would
not
be
sought
to
create
an
appetite
and
herdsmen
are
aware
of
the
fact
that
as
the
warm
season
commences
then
animals
require
less
food
instinct
teaches
these
animals
more
truly
in
this
particular
than
man
allows
reason
to
guide
him
quantity
of
food
should
have
reference
to
the
present
condition
of
the
digestive
if
they
are
weakened
or
diseased
so
that
but
a
small
quantity
of
food
can
be
properly
digested
or
changed
that
amount
only
should
be
taken
food
does
not
invigorate
the
system
except
it
is
changed
as
has
been
described
in
previous
paragraphs
when
taking
care
of
a
sick
child
the
anxiety
of
the
mother
and
the
sufferings
of
the
child
may
induce
her
to
give
food
when
it
would
be
highly
injurious
the
attending
physician
is
the
only
proper
person
to
direct
what
quantity
should
be
given
why
do
we
eat
more
in
the
winter
than
in
the
summer
what
practical
observation
is
given
why
should
the
quantity
of
food
be
lessened
as
warm
weather
commences
what
would
be
avoided
if
this
principle
were
obeyed
why
should
the
present
condition
of
the
digestive
organs
be
regarded
in
reference
to
the
quantity
of
food
mention
an
instance
in
which
it
would
be
injudicious
to
give
food
quantity
of
food
is
modified
in
some
degree
by
a
healthy
person
whose
exercise
is
in
pure
air
may
be
accustomed
to
take
more
food
than
is
necessary
the
useless
excess
is
removed
from
the
system
by
the
waste
outlets
as
the
skin
lungs
liver
kidneys
in
such
cases
if
food
is
not
taken
in
the
usual
quantity
there
will
be
a
feeling
of
emptiness
if
not
of
hunger
from
the
want
of
the
usual
distention
of
the
stomach
this
condition
of
the
digestive
organs
may
be
the
result
of
disease
but
it
is
more
frequently
produced
by
inordinate
daily
indulgence
in
eating
amounting
almost
to
gluttony
quantities
of
food
oppress
the
stomach
and
cause
general
languor
of
the
whole
this
is
produced
by
the
extra
demands
made
on
the
system
for
an
increased
supply
of
blood
and
nervous
fluid
to
enable
the
stomach
to
free
itself
of
its
burden
thus
when
we
intend
to
make
any
extraordinary
effort
mental
or
physical
at
least
for
one
meal
we
should
eat
less
food
than
usual
rather
than
a
greater
quantity
more
food
should
be
eaten
than
is
barely
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
nor
should
appetite
be
confounded
with
taste
the
one
is
a
natural
desire
for
food
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
system
the
other
is
an
artificial
desire
merely
to
gratify
the
palate
although
many
things
may
aid
us
in
determining
the
quantity
of
food
proper
for
an
individual
yet
there
is
no
certain
guide
in
all
cases
it
is
maintained
by
some
that
the
sensation
of
hunger
or
appetite
is
always
an
indication
of
the
want
of
food
while
the
absence
of
this
peculiar
sensation
is
regarded
as
conclusive
evidence
that
aliment
is
not
demanded
this
assertion
is
not
correct
as
an
appetite
may
be
created
for
food
by
condiments
and
gormandizing
which
is
as
artificial
and
as
morbid
as
that
which
craves
tobacco
or
ardent
spirits
on
the
other
hand
a
structural
or
functional
disease
of
the
brain
may
prevent
that
organ
from
taking

quantity
of
food
necessary
for
the
system
beaumont
noticed
in
the
experiments
upon
alexis
martin
that
after
a
certain
amount
of
food
was
converted
into
chyme
the
gastric
juice
ceased
to
ooze
from
the
coats
of
the
stomach
consequently
it
has
been
inferred
by
some
writers
on
physiology
that
the
glands
which
supply
the
gastric
fluid
by
a
species
of
instinctive
intelligence
would
only
secrete
enough
fluid
to
convert
into
chyme
the
aliment
needed
to
supply
the
real
wants
of
the
system
what
are
the
reasons
for
this
inference
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
gastric
glands
possess
instinctive
intelligence
and
can
there
be
a
reason
adduced
why
they
may
not
be
stimulated
to
extra
functional
action
as
well
as
other
organs
and
why
they
may
not
also
be
influenced
by
habit
while
all
agree
that
the
remote
or
predisposing
cause
of
hunger
is
usually
a
demand
of
the
system
for
nutrient
material
the
proximate
or
immediate
cause
of
the
sensation
of
hunger
is
not
clearly
understood
some
physiologists
suppose
that
it
is
produced
by
an
engorged
condition
of
the
glands
of
the
stomach
which
supply
the
gastric
juice
while
others
maintain
that
it
depends
on
a
peculiar
condition
of
the
nervous
system
the
quality
of
the
food
best
adapted
to
the
wants
of
the
system
is
modified
by
many
circumstances
there
are
many
varieties
of
food
and
these
are
much
modified
by
the
different
methods
of
preparation
the
same
kind
of
food
is
not
equally
well
adapted
to
different
individuals
or
to
the
same
individual
in
all
conditions
as
vocation
health
exposure
habits
of
life
season
climate
influence
the
condition
of
the
system
what
does
observation
show
what
is
said
of
the
causes
of
hunger
why
is
not
the
same
kind
of
food
adapted
to
different
individuals
all
articles
of
food
may
be
considered
in
two
relations
as
nutritive
as
digestible
substances
are
nutritious
in
proportion
to
their
capacity
to
yield
the
elements
of
chyle
of
which
carbon
oxygen
hydrogen
and
nitrogen
are
the
most
essential
they
are
digestible
in
proportion
to
the
facility
with
which
they
are
acted
upon
by
the
gastric
juice
these
properties
should
not
be
confounded
in
the
various
articles
used
for
food
as
a
living
body
has
no
power
of
forming
elements
or
of
converting
one
elementary
substance
into
another
it
therefore
follows
that
the
elements
of
which
the
body
of
an
animal
is
composed
must
be
in
the
food
chap
iii
of
the
essential
constituents
of
the
human
body
carbon
hydrogen
oxygen
and
nitrogen
are
the
most
important
because
they
compose
the
principal
part
of
the
animal
body
while
the
other
elements
are
found
in
very
small
proportions
and
many
of
them
only
in
a
few
organs
of
the
system
appendix
nitrogen
renders
food
more
stimulating
particularly
if
combined
with
a
large
quantity
of
carbon
as
beef
those
articles
that
contain
the
greatest
amount
of
the
constituent
elements
of
the
system
are
most
nutritious
as
milk
and
eggs
contain
all
the
essential
elements
of
the
human
system
so
they
are
adapted
to
almost
universal
use
and
are
highly
nutritious
in
what
proportion
are
substances
nutritious
digestible
why
does
beef
stimulate
the
system
what
is
said
of
milk
and
eggs
the
following
table

on

aid
the

in

to

let
the
pupil
mention
those
articles
of
food
that
are
most
nutritious
from
a
review
of
this
table
and
the
last
four
paragraphs
those
articles
that
do
not
contain
the
essential
elements
of
the
system
should
not
be
used
as
exclusive
articles
of
diet
this
principle
has
been
and
may
be
illustrated
by
experiment
feed
a
dog
with
pure
sugar
or
articles
that
contain
no
nitrogen
for
several
weeks
and
the
evil
effects
of
nutriment
will
be
manifested
at
first
the
dog
will
take
his
food
with
avidity
and
seem
to
thrive
upon
it
soon
this
desire
for
food
will
diminish
his
body
emaciate
his
eye
become
ulcerated
and
in
a
few
weeks
he
will
die
but
mix
bran
or
sawdust
with
the
sugar
or
oil
and
the
health
and
vigor
of
the
animal
will
be
maintained
for
months
a
similar
phenomenon
will
be
manifested
if
grain
only
be
given
to
a
horse
without
hay
straw
or
material
of
like
character
appendix
some
articles
of
food
contain
the
elements
of
chyle
in
great
abundance
yet
afford
but
little
nutriment
because
they
are
difficult
of
digestion
while
other
articles
contain
but
a
small
quantity
of
these
elements
and
afford
more
nourishment
because
they
are
more
easily
affected
by
the
digestive
process
how
has
the
effect
of
nutriment
been
illustrated
why
do
some
articles
of
food
that
contain
the
elements
of
chyle
afford
but
little
nutriment
why
do
articles
that
contain
a
small
quantity
of
these
elements
afford
more
nourishment
how
was
the
time
required
for
digesting
different
articles
of
food
ascertained
the
following
table
exhibits
the
general
results
of
experiments
made
on
alexis
martin
by
beaumont
when
he
endeavored
to
ascertain
the
time
required
for
the
digestion
of
different
articles
of
food
the
stomach
of
martin
was
ruptured
by
the
bursting
of
a
gun
when
he
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
accident
under
the
surgical
care
of
beaumont
the
stomach
became
adherent
to
the
side
with
an
external
aperture
nature
had
formed
a
kind
of
valve
which
closed
the
aperture
from
the
interior
and
thus
prevented
the
contents
of
the
stomach
from
escaping
but
on
pushing
it
aside
the
process
of
digestion
could
be
seen
through
this
opening
the
appearance
of
the
coats
of
the
stomach
and
food
at
different
stages
of
digestion
were
examined
the
time
required
for
the
digestion
of
the
different
articles
of
food
might
vary
in
other
persons
and
would
probably
vary
in
the
same
individual
at
different
periods
as
the
employment
health
season
exert
a

in
view
of
this
table
the
question
may
be
suggested
is
that
article
of
food
most
appropriate
to
the
system
which
is
most
easily
and
speedily
digested
to
this
it
may
be
replied
that
the
stomach
is
subject
to
the
same
law
as
the
muscles
and
other
organs
exercise
within
certain
limits
strengthens
it
if
therefore
we
always
eat
those
articles
most
easily
digested
the
digestive
powers
will
be
weakened
if
they
will
be
exhausted
hence
the
kind
and
amount
of
food
should
be
adapted
to
the
maintenance
of
the
digestive
powers
and
to
their
gradual
invigoration
when
debilitated
food
that
is
most
easily
digested
is
not
always
most
appropriate
to
a
person
convalescing
from
disease
if
the
substance
passes
rapidly
through
the
digestive
process
it
may
induce
a
recurrence
of
the
disease
thus
the
simple
preparations
which
are
not
stimulating
as
are
better
for
a
sick
person
than
the
more
digestible
beef
and
fish
the
question
is
not
well
settled
whether
animal
or
vegetable
food
is
best
adapted
to
nourish
man
there
are
nations
particularly
in
the
torrid
zone
that
subsist
exclusively
on
vegetables
while
those
of
the
frigid
zone
feed
on
fish
or
animal
food
in
the
temperate
zone
among
civilized
nations
a
mixed
diet
is
almost
universal
when
we
consider
the
organization
of
the
human
system
the
form
and
arrangement
of
the
teeth
the
structure
of
the
stomach
and
intestines
we
are
led
to
conclude
that
both
animal
and
vegetable
food
is
requisite
and
that
a
mixed
diet
is
most
conducive
to
strength
health
and
long
life
how
is
the
question
answered
whether
that
article
is
most
appropriate
to
the
system
which
is
most
easily
digested
give
observation
what
is
said
of
the
adaptation
of
animal
and
vegetable
food
to
man
food
should
be
adapted
to
the
distensible
character
of
the
stomach
and
alimentary
the
former
will
be
full
if
it
contain
only
a
gill
it
may
be
so
distended
as
to
contain
a
quart
the
same
is
true
of
the
intestines
if
the
food
is
concentrated
or
contains
the
quantity
of
nutriment
which
the
system
requires
in
small
bulk
the
stomach
and
intestines
will
need
the
stimulation
of
distention
and
friction
which
is
consequent
upon
the
introduction
and
transit
of
the
innutritious
material
into
and
through
the
alimentary
canal
if
the
food
is
deficient
in
innutritious
matter
the
tendency
is
to
produce
an
inactive
and
diseased
condition
of
the
digestive
organs
for
this
reason
nutrient
food
should
have
blended
with
it
innutritious
material
unbolted
wheat
bread
is
more
healthy
than
hot
flour
cakes
ripe
fruits
and
vegetables
than
rich
pies
or
jellies
the
observance
of
this
rule
is
of
more
importance
to
students
sedentary
mechanics
and
those
individuals
whose
digestive
apparatus
has
been
enfeebled
than
to
those
of
active
habits
and
firm
health
the
circumstance
that
different
articles
of
food
contain
different
proportions
of
waste
or
innutritious
matter
may
be
made
practically
subservient
in
the
following
way
if
at
any
particular
season
of
the
year
there
is
a
tendency
to
a
diarrhoea
an
article
that
contains
a
small
proportion
of
waste
should
be
selected
for
food
but
if
there
is
a
tendency
to
an
inactive
or
costive
condition
of
the
intestinal
canal
such
kinds
of
food
should
be
used
as
contain
the
greatest
proportion
of
waste
as
such
articles
are
most
stimulating
to
the
digestive
organs
and
consequently
most
laxative
the
selection
of
food
the
influence
of
season
and
climate

be

of
a
highly
stimulating
character

be
used
almost
with
impunity

the
cold
weather
of
a
cold
climate
but
in
the
warm
season
and
in
a
warm
climate
it
would
be
very
deleterious
animal
food
being
more
stimulating
than
vegetable
can
be
eaten
in
the
winter
but
vegetable
food
should
be
used
more
freely
in
the
spring
and
summer
what
is
said
of
the
distensible
character
of
the
stomach
and
alimentary
canal
what
is
the
effect

highly
concentrated

of
the
the
organs
of

more
sensitive

excitable
than
those

therefore
a

diet
would
be
most
appropriate
for

conducive
to
the
health
of

hygiene
of
the

continued
the
manner
in
which
food
should
be
taken
is
of
much
practical
importance
upon
it
the
health
of
the
digestive
organs
measurably
depends
but
few
circumstances
modify
the
proper
manner
of
taking
food
or
should
exercise
any
controlling
influence
should
be
taken
at
regular
the
interval
between
meals
should
be
regulated
by
the
character
of
the
food
the
age
health
exercise
and
habits
of
the
individual
the
digestive
process
is
more
energetic
and
rapid
in
the
young
active
and
vigorous
than
in
the
aged
indolent
and
feeble
consequently
food
should
be
taken
more
frequently
by
the
former
than
by
the
latter
class
in
some
young
and
vigorous
persons
food
may
be
digested
in
one
hour
in
other
persons
it
may
require
four
hours
or
more
the
average
time
however
to
digest
an
ordinary
meal
will
be
from
two
to
four
hours
in
all
instances
the
stomach
will
require
from
one
to
three
hours
to
recruit
its
exhausted
powers
after
the
labor
of
digesting
a
meal
before
it
will
again
enter
upon
the
vigorous
performance
of
its
duties
should
not
be
taken
too
if
food
is
taken
before
the
stomach
has
regained
its
tone
and
energy
by
repose
the
secretion
of
the
gastric
juice
and
the
contraction
of
the
muscular
fibres
will
be
imperfect
again
if
food
is
taken
before
the
digestion
of
the
preceding
meal
has
been
completed
the
effects
will
be
still
worse
because
the
food
partially
digested
becomes
mixed
with
that
last
taken
therefore
the
interval
between
each
meal
should
be
long
enough
for
the
whole
quantity
to
be
digested
and
the
time
of
repose
should
be
sufficient
to
recruit
the
exhausted
organs
the
feebler
the
person
and
the
more
debilitated
the
stomach
the
more
important
to
observe
the
above
directions
why
is
it
important
that
we
regard
the
manner
of
taking
our
food
how
should
the
intervals
between
meals
be
regulated
what
is
the
average
time
required
to
digest
an
ordinary
meal
why
should
not
food
be
taken
too
frequently
in
the
feeding
of
infants
as
well
as
in
supplying
food
to
older
children
the
preceding
suggestions
should
always
be
regarded
the
person
who
has
been
confined
by
an
exhausting
sickness
should
most
scrupulously
regard

the

all

reduced
to
a
state
of
comparative
fineness
by
the

before

fluid
of
the

then

the
practice
of

it
down
tends
to
derange

the

remarks
why
should

what
is
the
effect
of

how
should
mastication
be
performed
why
should
be
masticated
and
swallowed
without
as
the
salivary
glands
supply
fluid
to
moisten
the
dry
food
the
use
of
tea
coffee
water
or
any
other
fluid
is
not
demanded
by
nature
laws
while
taking
a
meal
one
objection
to
washing
down
the
food
with
drink
is
the
aliment
is
moistened
not
with
the
saliva
but
with
the
drink
this
tends
to
induce
disease
not
only
in
the
salivary
organs
by
leaving
them
in
a
state
of
comparative
inactivity
but
in
the
stomach
by
the
deficiency
of
the
salivary
stimulus
another
is
large
quantities
of
fluids
used
as
drinks
give
undue
distention
to
the
stomach
and
lessen
the
energy
of
the
gastric
juice
by
its
dilution
thus
retarding
digestion
again
drinks
taken
into
the
stomach
must
be
removed
by
absorption
before
the
digestion
of
other
articles
is
commenced
were
it
customary
not
to
place
drinks
on
the
table
until
the
solid
food
is
eaten
the
evil
arising
from
drinking
too
much
at
meals
would
be
obviated
the
horse
is
never
known
to
leave
his
provender
nor
the
ox
his
blade
of
grass
to
wash
it
down
but
many
persons
from
habit
rather
than
thirst
drink
largely
during
meals
the
peculiar
sensation
in
the
mouth
and
fauces
called
thirst
may
not
always
arise
from
the
demand
for
fluids
to
increase
the
water
of
the
blood
as
in
the
desire
for
drink
attendant
on
free
perspiration
for
then
pure
water
or
some
diluent
drink
is
absolutely
necessary
but
it
may
be
the
result
of
fever
or
local
disease
of
the
parts
connected
with
the
throat
in
many
instances
thirst
may
be
allayed
by
chewing
some
hard
substance
as
a
dry
cracker
this
excites
a
secretion
from
the
salivary
glands
which
removes
the
disagreeable
sensation
in
thirst
attendant
on
a
heated
condition
of
the
system
this
practice
affords
relief
and
is
safe
while
the
practice
of
drinking
large
quantities
of
cold
fluids
is
unsafe
and
should
never
be
indulged
why
should
all
persons
have
ample
time
for
eating
why
are
drinks
not
necessary
while
masticating
food
give
the
objections
to
washing
down
food
what
observation
relative
to
drink
does
the
sensation
of
thirst
always
arise
from
a
real
want
of
the
system
or
drink
should
not
be
taken
when
very
when
food
or
drink
is
taken
hot
the
vessels
of
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
gums
mouth
and
stomach
are
unduly
stimulated
for
a
short
time
and
this
is
followed
by
reaction
attended
by
a
loss
of
tone
and
debility
of
these
parts
this
practice
is
a
fruitful
cause
of
spongy
gums
decayed
teeth
sore
mouth
and
indigestion
or
drink
should
not
be
taken
very
if
a
considerable
quantity
of
very
cold
food
or
liquid
be
taken
immediately
into
the
stomach
the
health
will
be
endangered
and
the
tone
of
the
system
will
be
impaired
from
the
sudden
abstraction
of
heat
from
the
coats
of
the
stomach
and
from
surrounding
organs
to
impart
warmth
to
the
cold
food
or
drink
this
arrests
the
digestive
process
and
the
food
is
retained
in
the
stomach
too
long
and
causes
oppression
and
irritation
consequently
food
and
drink
that
are
moderately
heated
are
best
adapted
to
the
natural
condition
of
the
digestive
apparatus
food
of
an
injurious
quality
or
taken
in
an
improper
manner
affects
the
inferior
animals
as
well
as
man
the
teeth
of

that
are

two

instances
when
it

and
when
it
does
not
why
should
not

be
taken
hot
why
should
they
not
be
taken
cold
show
some
of
the
effects
of
improper
food
upon
the
inferior
animals
the
condition
of
the
system
should
be
regarded
when
food
is
taken
this
is
necessary
as
the
present
and
ulterior
condition
of
the
digestive
apparatus
is
strongly
influenced
by
the
state
of
the
other
organs
of
the
system
should
not
be
taken
immediately
after
severe
exertion
either
of
the
body
or
for
all
organs
in
action
require
and
receive
more
blood
and
nervous
fluid
than
when
at
rest
this
is
true
of
the
brain
muscles
and
vocal
organs
when
they
have
been
actively
exercised
the
increased
amount
of
fluid
both
sanguineous
and
nervous
supplied
to
any
organ
during
extra
functional
action
is
abstracted
from
other
parts
of
the
system
this
enfeebles
and
prostrates
the
parts
that
supply
the
blood
and
nervous
fluid
to
the
active
organ
again
when
any
organ
has
been
in
vigorous
action
for
a
few
hours
some
time
will
elapse
before
the
increased
action
of
the
arteries
and
nerves
abates
and
a
due
supply
of
fluids
is
transmitted
to
other
organs
or
an
equilibrium
of
action
in
the
system
is
reëstablished
thus
food
should
not
be
taken
immediately
after
severe
mental
labor
protracted
speaking
continued
singing
or
laborious
manual
toil
as
the
digestive
organs
will
be
in
a
state
of
comparative
debility
and
consequently
unfit
to
digest
food
from
thirty
to
sixty
minutes
should
elapse
after
the
cessation
of
severe
employment
before
food
is
taken
this
time
may
be
spent
in
cheerful
amusement
or
social
conversation
the
practice
of
students
and
accountants
going
immediately
from
severe
mental
labor
to
their
meals
is
a
pernicious
one
and
a
fruitful
cause
of
indigestion
and
mental
debility
the
custom
of
farmers
and
mechanics
hurrying
from
their
toil
to
the
does
much
to
cause
dyspepsia
and
debility
among
these
classes
in
community
should
the
condition
of
the
system
be
regarded
in
taking
food
when
should
food
not
be
taken
why
what
is
the
result
when
an
organ
has
been
in
vigorous
action
after
the
cessation
of
severe
toil
how
much
time
should
expire
before
eating
what
is
one
cause
of
indigestion
among
students
and
accountants
mental
or
manual
toil
should
not
be
entered
upon
immediately
after
as
there
is
an
increased
amount
of
blood
and
nervous
fluid
supplied
to
the
stomach
and
alimentary
canal
during
the
digestion
of
food
a
deficiency
exists
in
other
organs
this
is
evinced
by
a
slight
paleness
of
the
skin
and
a
disinclination
to
active
thought
and
exercise
under
such
circumstances
if
either
the
mind
vocal
organs
or
muscles
are
called
into
energetic
action
there
will
be
an
abstraction
of
the
necessary
amount
of
blood
and
nervous
fluid
from
the
stomach
and
the
process
of
digestion
will
be
arrested
this
will
not
only
cause
disease
of
the
digestive
organs
but
chyle
will
not
be
formed
to
nourish
the
system
an
english
gentleman
fed
two
dogs
upon
similar
articles
of
food
he
permitted
one
to
remain
quiet
in
a
dark
room
the
other
he
sent
in
pursuit
of
game
at
the
expiration
of
one
hour
he
had
both
killed
the
stomach
of
the
dog
that
had
remained
quiet
was
nearly
empty
the
food
had
been
properly
changed
and
carried
forward
into
the
alimentary
canal
in
the
stomach
of
the
dog
that
had
used
his
muscles
in
chasing
game
the
aliment
remained
nearly
unaltered
the
same
principle
may
be
applied
to
the
action
of
the
organs
of
man
if
his
mind
or
muscles
act
intensely
soon
after
eating
the
stomach
will
not
be
sufficiently
stimulated
by
blood
and
nervous
fluid
to
change
the
food
in
a
suitable
period
the
spanish
practice
of
having
a
siesta
or
sleep
after
dinner
is
far
better
than
the
custom
of
the
race
who
hurry
from
their
meals
to
the
field
shop
or
study
in
order
to
save
time
which
in
too
many
instances
is
lost
by
a
sense
of
oppression
and
suffering
which
soon
follows
why
should
not
severe
manual
or
mental
exertion
be
made
immediately
after
eating
state
the
illustration
may
this
principle
be
applied
to
the
action
of
the
human
stomach
what
is
said
of
the
spanish
custom
of
resting
after
dinner
in
some
instances
of
good
health
the
infringement
of
this
organic
law
may
seem
to
pass
with
impunity
but
nature
though
lenient
sooner
or
later
asserts
her
claims
the
practice
of
the
spaniard
may
be
improved
by
indulging
for
an
hour
before
resuming
toil
in
moderate
exercise
of
the
muscular
system
conjoined
with
agreeable
conversation
and
a
hearty
laugh
as
this
facilitates
digestion
and
tends
to
shake
the
cobwebs
from
the
brain
no
judicious
teamster
drives
his
animals
as
soon
as
they
have
swallowed
their
food
but
gives
them
a
period
for
repose
so
that
their
food
may
be
digested
and
their
systems
invigorated
in
this
way

secures
the
greatest
amount
of

an
influence
upon

this
is
clearly
exhibited
when
an
individual
receives
intelligence
of
the
loss
of
a
friend
or
of
property
he
may
at
the
time
be
sitting
before
a
plentiful
board
with
a
keen
appetite
but
the
unexpected
news
destroys
it
because
the
excited
brain
withholds
its
stimulus
this
shows
the
propriety
of
avoiding
absorbing
topics
of
thought
at
meals
as
labored
discussions
and
matters
of
business
but
substitute
cheerful
and
light
conversation
enlivening
wit
humor
the
social
intercourse
of
family
and

these
keep
the
brain
in
action
but
not
in

under
such
circumstances

periods
large
quantities
of

taken
serve
to
increase
the

prostration
those
afflicted
should
exercise
in
the
open
air
and
engage
in

the
brain
may
be
excited
to

be
improved
how

what
does
it
show
the
necessity

avoiding
how
should
indigestion

from
nervous
prostration
be
treated
should
abstain
from

at

three
hours
before

for
it

no
unusual
occurrence
for
those
persons
who
have
eaten
heartily
immediately
before
retiring
to

to
have
unpleasant
dreams
or
to
be
aroused
from
their
unquiet

a
healthy
farmer
who
was
in
the
habit
of
eating
one
fourth
of
a
mince
pie
immediately
before
going
to

became
annoyed
with
unpleasant
dreams
and
among
the
varied
images
of
his
fancy
he
saw
that
of
his
deceased
father
becoming
alarmed
he
consulted
a
physician
who
after
a
patient
hearing
of
the
case
gravely
advised
him
to
eat
of
a
mince
pie
assuring
him
that
he
would
then
see
his
grandfather

general
system

be
in
the
instance
of
a
shipwrecked
and
famished
mariner
or
a
patient
recovering
from
disease
but
a
small
quantity
of
nourishment
should
be
given
at
a
time
the
reason
for
this
is
that
when
the
stomach
is
weakened
from
want
of
nourishment
it
is
as
unfitted
for
a
long
period
of
action
in
digesting
food
as
the
muscles
are
under
like
circumstances
for
walking
consequently
knowledge
and
prudence
should
direct
the
administration
of
food
under
these
circumstances
the
popular
adage
that
food
never
does
harm
when
there
is
a
desire
for
it

if
practically
adopted
may
be
injurious

in

likewise
prevent

what

has
the

it
is
noted
of
individuals
who
restrain
the

of
the
abdominal
muscles
by
tight
dresses
that
the
tone

vigor
of
the

are
diminished
the
restricted
waist
will
not
admit
of
a
full

deep
inspiration
and
so
essential
is
this
to
health
that
abuse
in
this
respect
soon
enfeebles
and
destroys
the
functions
of
the
system
air
is
necessary
to
give
a
keen
appetite
and
vigorous
the
digestive
organs
not
only
need
the
stimulus
of
blood
but
they
absolutely
need
the
influence
of
pure
blood
which
can
not
exist
in
the
system
except
when
we
breathe
a
pure
air
from
this
we
learn
why
those
persons
who
sleep
in
small
ill
ventilated
rooms
have
little
or
no
appetite
in
the
morning
and
why
the
mouth
and
throat
are
so
dry
and
disagreeable
the
effect
of
impure
blood
in
diminishing
the
desire
for
food
and
enfeebling
the
digestive
organs
is
well
illustrated
by
the
following
incidents
reid
in
his
work
on
ventilation
of
rooms
relates
that
an
innkeeper
in
london
when
he
provided
a
public
dinner
always
spread
his
tables
in
an
room
with
low
walls
where
the
air
was
confined
and
impure
he
assigned
as
a
reason
for
so
doing
that
his

the
function
of

of

is

and
that
the

they

judging
from

it
must
be
very
great
the
phenomenon
known

the
motion
caused

but
make
strong
pressure
upon
the
lower
point
only
and
the
pulsation
will
continue
at
the

proving
that

there
are
several
influences
either
separately
or
combined
that
propel
the
blood
from
the
heart
through
the
arteries
among
which
may
be
named
the
contraction
of
the
muscular
walls
of
the
heart
the
contractile
and
elastic
middle
coat
of
the
arteries
aids
the
heart
in
impelling
the
blood
to
the
minute
vessels
of
the
system
the
peculiar
action
of
the
minute
capillary
vessels
is
considered
by
some
physiologists
as
a
motive
power
in
the
arterial
circulation
the
pressure
of
the
muscles
upon
the
arteries
when
in
a
state
of
contraction
is
a
powerful
agent
particularly
when
they
are
in
active
exercise
the
following
experiments
will
demonstrate
that
the
blood
from
every
part
of
the
system
flows
to
the
heart
by
the
agency
of
the
veins
press
firmly
on
one
of
the
veins
upon
the
back
of
the
hand
carrying
the
pressure
toward
the
fingers
for
a
moment
the
vein
will
disappear
on
removing
the
pressure
of
the
finger
it
will
reappear
from
the
blood
rushing
in
from
below
if
a
tape
be
tied
around
the
arm
above
the
elbow
the
veins
below
will
become
larger
and
more
prominent
and
also
a
greater
number
will
be
brought
in
view
while
the
veins
above
the
tape
are
less
distended
at
this
time
apply
the
finger
at
the
wrist
and
the
pulsation
of
the
arteries
still
continues
showing
that
the
blood
is
constantly
flowing
from
the
heart
through
the
arteries
into
the
veins
and
the
increased
size
of
the
veins
shows
that
the
pressure
of
the
tape
prevents
its
flowing
back
to
the
heart
state
the
influences
that
propel
the
blood
from
the
heart
demonstrate
by
the
first
experiment
that
the
blood
flows
to
the
heart
by
the
second
experiment
the
influences
that
return
the
blood
to
the
heart
through
the
veins
are
not
so
easily
understood
as
those
that
act
on
the
blood
in
the
arteries
some
physiologists
have
imputed
an
active
propulsive
power
to
the
capillary
vessels
in
carrying
the
blood
through
the
veins
this
is
not
easily
explained
and
perhaps
it
is
as
difficult
to
understand
an
influence
upon
which
others
have
dwelt
is
the
suction
power
of
the
heart
in
active
dilatation
acting
as
a
a
power
in
front
in
drawing
blood
to
it
another
influence
that
aids
the
venous
circulation
is
attributed
to
the
propulsive
power
of
the
heart
it
is
not
easy
to
comprehend
how
this
power
of
the
heart
can
be
extended
through
the
capillary
vessels
to
the
blood
in
the
veins
again
an
important
agency
has
been
found
by
some
physiologists
in
the
inspiratory
movements
which
are
supposed
to
draw
the
blood
of
the
veins
into
the
chest
in
order
to
supply
the
vacuum
which
is
created
there
by
the
elevation
of
the
ribs
and
the
descent
of
the
diaphragm
one
of
the
most
powerful
causes
which
influence
the
venous
circulation
is
the
action
of
the
muscles
upon
the
venous
trunks
when
the
muscles
are
contracted
they
compress
that
portion
of
the
veins
which
lie
beneath
the
swell
and
thus
force
the
blood
from
one
valve
to
the
other
toward
the
heart
when
they
are
relaxed
the
veins
refill
and
are
compressed
by
the
recurring
action
of
the
muscles
the
physician
in
opening
a
vein
relies
on
the
energetic
contractions
and
sudden
relaxations
of
the
muscles
when
he
directs
the
patient
to
clasp
the
head
of
a
cane
or
the
arm
of
a
chair
these
alternate
motions
of
the
muscles
cause
an
increased
flow
of
blood
to
the
veins
of
the
ligated
arm

the
influences

if

this
remark
is
particularly
important
to
scholars
public

and
individuals
predisposed
to
apoplexy
and
other
diseases
of
the
brain
as
many
of
the
large

if
the

or
any
other
article
of
apparel
in

be
tight
and
inelastic
the
passage
of

through
these

will
be
obstructed
producing
by

the

the
practical
utility

persons
were
ignorant
of
the
method
of
compressing
severed

a
surgeon
could
be
obtained
in
a

high
school
rushed
through
the
crowd
that
surrounded
the
apparently
dying
man
placed
his
finger

these
should
be
put

applied
to

absorption
absorption
is
the
process
by
which
the
materials
of
nutrition
are
removed
from
the
alimentary
canal
to
be
conveyed
into
the
circulatory
vessels
it
is
likewise
the
process
by
which
the
particles
of
matter
that
have
become
injurious
or
useless
are
removed
from
the
mass
of
fluids
and
solids
of
which
the
body
is
composed
these
renovating
and
removing
processes
are
performed
by

the

are
found
only
in
the
alimentary
canal
they
are
called
lacteals
the
vessels
whose
sole
function
is
to
remove
particles
of

already

perform
the

this
fact
accounts
for
the
capacity
of
the
venous
system
exceeding
the
arterial
had
the
veins
no
other
function
to
perform
beside
returning
the
blood
that
had
been
distributed
by
the

it
would
be
reasonable
to
suppose
that
this
system
would
be
less
than
the
arterial
but
the
reverse
is
known
to
be
true
the
lymphatic
vessels
in
structure
resemble
the
lacteals
they
exist
in
great
numbers
in
the
skin
and
mucous
membranes
particularly
those
of
the
lungs
though
no
lymphatics
have
been
traced
to
the

it

that
they
exist
there
as
this
part
of
the
body
is
not
exempt
from
the
composition
and
decomposition
which
are
perpetual
in

these

interstitial

every

the

the

myriads
of

is
constantly
depositing
new
atoms

then
die

these
old

thus
wherever
there
is
a

artery
to

there
is
a

the

in

we
find

every

these
with

are
arranged
in
a
peculiar
manner
and
connected
by

there
are
two
classes
of
glands
one
for
the
modification
of
the
fluids
which
pass
through
them
as
the
mesenteric
and
lymphatic
glands
and
the
other
for
the

physiology
of

secretion
is
one
of
the
most
obscure
and
mysterious
functions
of
the
animal
economy
it
is
that
process
by
which
various
substances
are
separated
from
the
blood
either
with
or
without
experiencing
any
change
during
their
separation
not
only
is
the
process
by
which
substances
are
separated
from
the
blood
called
secretion
but
the
same
term
is
also
applied
to
substances
thus
separated
thus
physiologists
say
that
by
the
process
of
secretion
bile
is
formed
by
the
liver
and
also
that
bile
is
the
secretion

the

not
exist
in

most
of
the
elements
of
which
they
are
made
do
exist
in
this

the

by
which
it
is
accomplished
may
well
be
called
the

of

construct
a

we
see
the

wonderful

possessed
also
by

all
are
composed
of
the

simple
elements
arranged
in
different
order
and

in

we
find
the

of
the
agents
that
produce

direct
the
different
secretions
we
have
no
very
accurate
knowledge
some
have
supposed
this
function
to
be
mechanical
others
a
chemical
process
but
experiments
prove
that
it
is
dependent
on
nervous
influence
if
the
nerves
are
divided
which
are
distributed
to
any
organ
the
process
of

is
suspended
it
is
no
uncommon
occurrence
that
the
nature
of
milk
will
be

changed

have
we
accurate

that
produce
secretion
secretions
are
constantly
maintained
during
life
from
the
serous
membrane
by
the
action
of
the
internal
exhalants
the
fluid
which
is
exhaled
bears
some
resemblance
to
the
serum
of
the
blood
its
use
is
to
furnish
the
organs
which
are
surrounded
by
this
membrane
with
a
proper
degree
of
moisture
and
thus
enables
them
to
move
easily
on
each
other
as
those
within
the
chest
and
abdomen
the
cellular
tissue
exhales
a
serous
fluid
and
when
it
becomes
excessive
in
quantity
general
dropsy
is
produced
fat
is
another
secretion
which
is
thrown
out
in
a
fluid
state
from
the
cellular
membrane
it
is
deposited
in
little
cells
and
exists
in
the
greatest
abundance
between
the
skin
and
the
muscles
its
use
seems
to
be
to
form
a
cushion
around
the
body
for
its
protection
to
furnish
nutriment
for
the
system
when
food
can
not
be
taken
to
supply
the
carbon
and
hydrogen
necessary
to
sustain
the

are
not
otherwise
furnished
the

marrow
in

of

long
bones
is
very
much
like
fat
during
sickness
if
there
is
not
emaciation
or
absorption
of
this
secretion
it
is
considered
an
unfavorable
symptom
because
it
indicates
a
want
of
power
in
the
absorbing
system
which
is
among
the
last
to
be
affected
how
is
it
proved
that

depends
on
nervous
influence
what

the
mucous
secretion
is
a
transparent
viscid
fluid
which
is
secreted
by
those
membranes
that
line
the
cavities
of
the
body
which
have
an
external
communication
as
the
trachea
and
alimentary
canal
this
secretion
serves
to
protect
these
parts
from
the
influence
of
the
air
and
concurs
by
means
of
its
peculiar
properties
in
the
performance
of
their
functions
there
are
two
external
secretions
namely
one
from
the
skin
called
perspiration
and
the
other
from
the
lungs
the
cutaneous
exhalation
or
transpiration
exists
in
two
forms
called
sensible
perspiration
sweat
and
insensible
perspiration
the
pulmonary
exhalation
is
the
most
important
and
universal
and
closely
resembles
that
of
the
skin
is
a
term
often
used
generically
to
signify
the
passage
of
fluids
or
gases
through
membranes
internally
or
externally
but
is
a
specific
term
signifying
transpiration
on
to
the
external
surface
the
follicles
are
found
only
in
the
skin
and
mucous
membrane
they
secrete
an
oily
unctuous
substance
which
mixes
with
the
transpiration
and
lubricates
the
skin
at
the
root
of
each
hair
there
is
a
minute
follicle
which
secretes
the
fluid
that
oils
the
hair
the
wax
in
the
passage
of
the
ear
is
secreted
from
these
bodies
all
the
blood
distributed
to
the
different
glands
is
similar
in
composition
and
character
but
the
fluids
secreted
by
them
vary
in
appearance
in
a
remarkable
degree
the
office
of
the
glands
appears
to
be
principally
to
form
different
secretions
thus
the
salivary
glands
secrete
the
insipid
saliva
the
lachrymal
glands
the
saline
tears
the
liver
the
yellow
ropy
bile
and
the
kidneys
the
acrid

of
the

what
appears
to
be
the
principal

of

mention
a
secretion
produced
in
a
particular
emergency
some
secretions
are
evidently
produced
only
in
particular
emergencies
as
is
seen
in
the
increased
secretion
of
bony
matter
when
a
limb
is
broken
when
any
substance
which
is
not
demanded
for
nutrition
or
does
not
give
nourishment
to
the
system
is
imbibed
by
the
lymphatic
vessels
and
conveyed
into
the
blood
it
is
eliminated
in
the
secretions
a
few
years
since
a
poor
inebriate
was
carried
to
a
london
hospital
in
a
state
of
intoxication
he
lived
but
a
few
hours
on
examining
his
brain
nearly
half
a
gill
of
fluid
strongly
impregnated
with
gin
was
found
in
the
cavities
of
this
organ
this
was
secreted
from
the

hygiene

the

be
suppressed
and
fever
or
some
internal
inflammation
will
follow
if
the
bile
is
impeded
digestion
will
be
impaired
if
any
other
secretion
is
suppressed
it
will
cause
a
derangement
of
the
various
internal

ardent
spirits
derange
the
secretions
and
change
the

this
is

do
not

quantity

when
a

when

give
an
illustration
secretory
organs
require
the
stimulus
of
pure
if
this
fluid
is
vitiated
the
action
of
the
secretory
organs
will
be
more
or
less
modified
either
the
quantity
will
be
affected
or
the
quality
will
be
altered
the
impurity
of
the
blood
arising
from
the
inhalation
of
the
vitiated
air
of
sleeping
rooms
diminishes
and
changes
the
character
of
the
secretions
of
the
mouth
and
stomach
this
accounts
for
the
thirst
coated
tongue
and
disagreeable
taste
of
the
mouth
when
impure
air
is
breathed
during
sleep
the
disease
it
induces
is
indigestion
or
dyspepsia
amount
of

modifies
the
condition
of
the
secretory
when
a
secretory
organ
is
excessively
stimulated
its
vigor
and
energy
are
reduced
the
subsequent
debility
may
be
so
great
as
to
suppress
or
destroy
its
functional
power
in
those
sections
of
the
country
where
flax
is
spun
on
a
it
is
not
unfrequent
that
the
spinners
moisten
the
thread
with
the
secretions
of
the
mouth
this
seems
to
operate
economically
for
a
time
but
debility
of
the
salivary
organs
soon
follows
which
incapacitates
them
from
supplying
saliva
sufficient
to
moisten
the
food
producing
in
a
short
time
disease
of
the
digestive
organs
the
habit
of
continual
spitting
which
attends
the
chewing
of
tobacco
and
gums
and
other
substances
between

induces

do
the

of
this
increased

of

organ
may
be
sustained
for
a
limited
time
without
permanent
injury
but
if
long
continued
a
diseased
action
of
the

will
follow
of
morbid
secretions
we
have
examples
in
the
ossification
of
the

of
the

and
other
tumors
what
is
the
effect
of
impure

on
the
secretory
organs
what
results
from

excessively
a

how
is
this
illustrated
what
is
the

when
one
secretory
organ
performs
the
office
of
another
in
the
evenings
of
the
warm

a

skin
that
suppresses
the

is
frequently
followed
by
a
diarrhoea
dysentery
or
cholera
morbus
these
can
be
prevented
by
avoiding
the
chill
an
efficient
means
of
relief
is
immediately
to
restore
the
skin
to
its
proper
action
secretions
are
much
influenced
by
the
how
this
is
effected
it
is
difficult
to
explain
but
many
facts
corroborate
it
every
one
has
felt
an
increased
action
of
the

cheerfulness
of
disposition
and
serenity
of
the
passions
are
peculiarly
favorable
to
the
proper
performance
of
the
secretory
function
from
this
we
may
learn
how
important
it
is
to
avoid
such
things
as
distract
agitate
or
harass
us
in
fevers
and
other
diseases
when
the
skin

from
a

let
the

and
the

will
exhibit
a
more
moist

together
with
a
general
improvement
of
the

nutrition
nutrition
is
the
vital
act
by
which
the
different
parts
of
the
body
renew
the
materials
of
which
they
are
composed
digestion
circulation
absorption
and

are
but
separate
links
in
the
chain
of
nutrition
which
would
be
destroyed
by
the
absence
of
any
one
of
them
the
nutritive
process
is
also
a
kind
of
secretion
by
which
particles
of
matter
are
separated
from
the
blood
and
conveyed
with
wonderful
accuracy
to
the
appropriate

the

antagonizes
those
of

while
one
system
is
constructing
with
beautiful
precision
the
animal
frame
the
other
is
diligently
employed
in
pulling
down
this
complicated
structure
this
state
of
the
body
is
shown
by
giving
animals
colored
matter
mixed
with
their
food
which
in
a
short
time
tinges
their
bones
with
the

color
as
the

introduced
let
it
be
withdrawn
and
in
a
few
days
the
bones
will
assume
their
former
color
evidently
from
the
effects
of
absorption
the
changeful
state
of
the

is
further
shown
by
the

to
which
it
is

every

of
the

is
subject
to
this
continual
change
of
material
yet
it
is
effected
with
such
regularity
that
the
size
shape
and
appearance
of
every
organ
is
preserved
and
after
an
interval
of
a
few
years
there
may
not
remain
a
particle
of
matter
which
existed
in
the
system
at
a
former
period
notwithstanding
this
entire
change
the
personal
identity
is
never
lost
many
calculations
have
been
made
to
determine
in
what
length
of
time
the
whole
body
is
renewed
some
have
supposed
that
it
is
accomplished
in
four
years
others
have
fixed
the
period
at
seven
years
but
the
time
of
the
change
is
not
definite
as
was
supposed
by
a
genuine
son
of

consequently
maintained
that
he

ink

hence
some
assert
that
this
tissue
is
an
exception
to
the
alternate
deposition
and
removal
of
its
atoms
the
ink
remains
because
its
particles
are
too
large
to
be
absorbed
and
when
in
the

it
is
insoluble
those
animals
which
are
most

in
their
structure
and
are
distinguished
by
the
greatest
variety
of
vital
manifestations
are
subject
to
the
most
rapid

such
animals
require
more
frequent
and
more

supplies
of

and
in
proportion
as
they
are
exposed
to
the
greater
number
of
external

will
be
the
rapidity
of
this

animals
may
be
situated
so
that
they
lose
nothing
by

consequently
they

give
the
opinion
of
physiologists
respecting
the

what
exception

what

may

what

the

is
not
perfected
merely
by
the
general

but
through
the
agency

system
of
minute
vessels
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
can
not
be
seen
by
the
eye
even
when
aided
by
the
microscope
still
minute
as
they
are
the
function
of
these
agents
is
necessary
to
the
continuance
of
life
they
are
the
smallest
capillary
vessels
as
the
blood
goes
the
round
of
the
circulation
the
nutrient
capillary
vessels
select
and
secrete
those
parts
which
are
similar
to
the
nature
of
the
structure
and
the
other
portions
pass
on
so
that
every
tissue
imbibes
and
converts
to
its
own
use
the
very
principles
which
it
requires
for
its
growth
or
in
other
words
as
the
vital
current
approaches
each
organ
the
particles
appropriate
to
it
feel
its
attractive
force
obey
it
quit
the
stream
mingle
with
the
substance
of
its
tissue
and
are
changed
into
its
own
true
and
proper
nature
thus
if
a
bone
is
broken
a
muscle
or
a
nerve
wounded
and
if
the
system
is
in
a
proper
state
of
health
the
vital
economy
immediately
sets
about
healing
the
rupture
the
blood
which
flows
from
the
wounded
vessels
coagulates
in
the
incision
for
the
double
purpose
of
stanching
the
wound
and
of
forming
a
matrix
for
the
regeneration
of
the
parts
very
soon
minute
vessels
shoot
out
from
the
living
parts
into
the
coagulum
of
the
blood
and
immediately
commence
their
operations
and
deposit
bony
matter
where
it
is
required
to
unite
fractured
bones
and
nervous
substance
to
heal
the
wounded
nerve
show
how
the
renovation
of
the
bones
muscles
is
perfected
what
is
said
of
the
office
of
the
nutrient
capillary
vessels
when
a
bone
is
fractured
by
what
process
is
it
healed
but
the
vital
economy
seems
not
to
possess
the
power
of
reproducing
the
muscles
and
true
skin
and
therefore
when
these
parts
are
wounded
the
rupture
is
repaired
by
a
gelatinous
substance
which
gradually
becomes
hard
and
sometimes
assumes
something
of
a
fibrous
appearance
it
so
perfectly
unites
the
divided
muscle
however
as
to
restore
its
functional
power
when
the
cuticle
is
removed
it
is
reproduced
and
no
scar
remains
but
when
the
true
skin
is
destroyed
a
scar
is
formed
it
is
not
uncommon
that
the
nutrient
arteries
have
their
action
so
much
increased
in
some
parts
as
to
produce
preternatural
growth
sometimes
the
vessels
whose
function
it
is
to
deposit
fat
are
increased
in
action
and
wens
of
no
inferior
size
are
formed
again
there
may
be
a
deposition
of
substances
unlike
any
known
to
exist
in
the
body
occasionally
these
nutrient
arteries
of
a
part
take
on
a
new
action
and
not
only
deposit
their
ordinary
substance
but
others
which
they
have
not
heretofore
secreted
but
which
are
formed
by
vessels
of
other
parts
of
the
body
it
is
in
this
way
that
we
account
for
the
bony
matter
deposited
in
the
valves
of
the
heart
and
brain
also
the
chalky
deposits
around
the
in
infancy
and
childhood
the
function
of
nutrition
is
very
active
a
large
amount
of
food
is
taken
to
supply
the
place
of
what
is
lost
by
the
action
of
the
absorbents
and
also
to
contribute
to
the
growth
of
the
body
in
middle
age
nutrition
and
absorption
are
more
equal
but
in
old
age
the
absorbents
are
more
active
than
the
nutrient
vessels
the
size
consequently
diminishes
the
parts
become
weaker
the
bones
more
brittle
the
body
bends
forward
and
every
function
exhibits
marks
of
decay
and
dissolution
a
striking
instance
of
active
absorption
in
middle
age
was
exhibited
in
the
person
of
calvin
edson
of
vermont
who
was
exhibited
in
the
large
towns
of
new
england
as
the
living
skeleton
in
early
manhood
he
was
athletic
and
weighed
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
but
the
excessive
action
of
the
absorbents
over
the
nutrient
vessels
reduced
his
weight
in
the
interval
of
eighteen
years
to
sixty
pounds

occurs
when
a
muscle
is
divided
state
some
of
the
results
of
an
increased
action
of
the
nutrient
arteries

active

in
old
age
relate
a
striking
instance
of
active
absorption
in
middle
age
instances
on
the
other
hand
have
occurred
of
the
action
of
the
nutrient
vessels
exceeding
in
an
extreme
degree
those
of
absorption
as
in
the
person
of
a
colored
girl
thirteen
years
of
age
who
was
exhibited
in
new
york
in
the
summer
of

was
of
the
height
of

at
that
age
but
weighed
five
hundred
pounds
several
cases
are
on
record
of
persons
weighing
eight
hundred
pounds
as
already
mentioned
the
blood
is
the
nutritive
fluid
of
animals
when
this
fluid
is
coagulated
a
thick
mass
floats
in
the
serum
called
coagulum
this
coagulated
mass
is
composed
of
fibrin
and
red
globulated
matter
the
color
of
the
red
globules
is
owing
to
the
presence
of
iron
though
some
physiologists
think
it
depends
on
an
animal
substance
of
a
gelatinous
character
that
portion
of

remains
fluid

coagulation

the

is
not
necessarily

it
may
be

as
in
most
fish
there
is
no
animal
in
which
the

is
equally
red
in
all
parts
of
the
body
the
ligaments
tendons
and
other
white
tissues
in
man
are
supplied
but
sparingly
with

that
supplies
these

nutrition

they
will
become
soft
or

their
vitality
will
be

and
disease
will
be
the
ultimate
result
the

these

upon
the

depends
the
ability
to
labor
give
these
organs
of

impure
blood
which
is
an
unhealthy
stimulus
and
they
will
become
enfeebled
the
step
will
lose
its
elasticity
the
movement
of
the

will
be

and
every
muscle
will
be
incapacitated
to
perform

amount
of
labor
when
the
stomach
liver
and
other
organs
subservient
to
the
digestion
of

are
supplied
with
impure

the
digestive
process
is
impaired
causing
faintness
and
loss
of
appetite
also
a

and
in

all

of
dyspepsia
the

when

the

and
even
if
permitted

to
change
the
impure
quality
of
this

the
health

of
the

but
if
the
arteries
of

receive
vitiated

pimples

appear
and
the
individual
suffers

in

the

and
the

an

induces

more
slowly

excess
of
the

the
function
of
the
organ
may
be
totally
and
permanently
destroyed
if
the
exertion
is
extremely
violent
we
sometimes
see
palsy
produced
in
a
muscle
simply
by
the
effort
to
raise
too
great
a
weight
the
sight
is
impaired
and
total
blindness
may
be
produced
by
exposure
to

the

insufficient
or
is
entirely
arrested
and
then
the
absorbents
remove
it
wholly
or
partially
as
they
do
every
thing
that
is
no
longer
useful
thus
in
palsied
patients
a
few
years
after
the
attack
we
often
find
scarce
any
trace
of
the
palsied
muscles
remaining
they

physiology
of
the
respiratory
organs
respiration
or
breathing
is
that
process
by
which
air
is
taken
into
the
lungs
and
expelled
from
them
the
object
of
respiration
is
to
supply
the
system
with
oxygen
which
is
essential
to
the
generation
of
animal
heat
to
convert
the
chyle
into
blood
this
is
done
by
the
oxygen
of
the
inspired
air
to
relieve
the
organs
of
the
body
of
the
principal
elements
carbon
and
hydrogen
that
compose
the
old
and
useless
particles
of
matter
the
organs
of
the
system
as
already
mentioned
are
principally
composed
of
carbon
hydrogen
oxygen
and
nitrogen
by
the
action
of
the
lymphatics
and
capillary
veins
the
old
and
particles
are
conveyed
into
the
veins
of
the
systemic
circulation
the
hydrogen
in
form
of
watery
vapor
is
easily
discharged
in
the
perspiration
and
other
secretions
the
nitrogen
and
oxygen
are
or
may
be
separated
from
the
blood
through
the
agency
of
several
different
organs
but
carbon
does
not
escape
so
readily
it
is
probable
that
a
part
of
the
surplus
carbon
of
the
venous
blood
is
secreted
by
the
liver
but
a
far
greater
amount
passes
to
the
lungs
and
these
may
be
considered
as
special
organs
designed
to
separate
this
element
from
the
venous
blood
an
ordinary
inspiration
may
be
accomplished
by
the
action
of
the
diaphragm
and
a
slight
elevation
of
the
ribs
in
full
inspiration
the
diaphragm
is
not
only
more
depressed
but
the
ribs
are
evidently
elevated
to
produce
this
effect
on
the
ribs
two
sets
of
muscles
are
called
into
action
those
which
are
attached
to
the
upper
rib
sternum
and
clavicle
contract
and
elevate
the
lower
and
free
extremities
of
the
ribs
this
enlarges
the
cavity
of
the
chest
between
the
spinal
column
and
the
sternum
but
the
lateral
diameter
in
consequence
is
only
slightly
increased
because
the
central
portion
of
the

sinks

the

the

apparently
atmospheric
air
is
a
simple
element
but
chemical
analysis
shows
its
composition
to
be
oxygen
and
nitrogen
in
the
proportion
of
parts
of
the
former
and
about
of
the
latter
in
addition
there
is
a

amount
of
vapor
of
water
and
carbonic

the
pressure
of
this
invisible
elastic
fluid
upon
the

of
an
ordinary

adult
is
estimated
to
equal
thousand
pounds
the
principal
substance
of
a
vitiated
character
in
the
blood
is
carbonic
acid
and
since
there
is
no
chemical
affinity
between
the
oxygen
and
nitrogen
of
the
air
the
former
readily
unites
with
some
of
the
elements
of
the
blood
hence
whenever
blood
is
presented
to
the
air
in
the
lungs
the
oxygen
leaves
the
nitrogen
and
becomes
mixed
with
the
circulating

what
is
said
of

again
carbonic
acid
and
water
have
a
stronger
affinity
for
atmospheric
air
than
for
the
other

of
the

consequently
when
they
are
brought
into

with
the
air
in
the
lungs
the
carbonic
acid
and
water
leave
the
other
constituents
of

unite
with
the

in
this
way
the

and
becomes

appendix
the
formation
of
carbonic

eliminated
from
the

through

is
explained
by
the
following
theory
in
the
lungs
and
upon
the
skin
the
oxygen
separates
from
the
nitrogen
and
unites
with
the
blood
in
the
capillary
vessels
of
these
organs
the
oxygen
is
conveyed
with
the
blood
to
the
capillary
arteries
and
veins
of
the
different
tissues
of
the
system
in
these
membranes
there
is
a
chemical
union
of
the
oxygen
with
the
carbon
and
hydrogen
contained
in
the
blood
and
waste
atoms
of
the

this
combustion
or
union
of

is
attended
with
the
disengagement
of

and
the
formation
of

in

as
the

than
for

so
it
permeates
the

that
intervene
between

more
readily
than
the
nitrogen
as
the
carbonic
acid
and
water
have
a
greater
affinity
for

than
for
the
other

of

so
they

it

one

this
may

it

the

a

but
the
dog
that

him
falls
apparently
dead

soon
dies
if

this
arises
from
the
fact
that
this

is
heavier
than

and
sinks
to
the
bottom
of
the
room

while
it
is
true
that

it
is
notwithstanding
productive
of

the
question
may
be
asked
to
what
degree
may
the

be
vitiated

still
sustain

and
what
is
the
smallest
quantity
of

birnan
says
that
air
which
contains
more
than
three
and
a
half
per
cent
of
carbonic
acid
is
unfit
for
respiration
and
as
air
once
respired
contains
eight
and
a
half
per
cent
of
carbonic
acid
it
clearly
shows
that
it
is
not
fitted
to
be
breathed
again
no
physiologist
pretends
that
less
than
seven
cubic
feet
of
air
are
adequate
for
a
man
to
breathe
each
minute
while
reid
allows
ten
feet
the
necessity
of
fifteen
or
twenty
times
the
amount
of
air
actually
taken
into
the
lungs
arises
from
the
circumstance
that
the
expired

mixes
with
and
vitiates
the
surrounding
element
that
has
not
been
inhaled
quantity
of
air
which
different
persons
actually
need
the
demand
is
modified
by
the
size
age
habits
and
condition
of
the
body
a
person
of
great
size
who
has
a
large
quantity
of
blood
requires
more
air
than
a
small
man
with
a
less
amount
of
circulating
fluid
individuals
whose
labor
is
active
require
more
air
than
sedentary
or
idle
persons
because
the
waste
of
the
system
is
greater
on
the
same
principle
the
gormandizer
needs
more
of
this
element
than
the
person
of
abstemious
habits
so
does
the
growing
lad
require
more
air
than
an
adult
of
the
same
weight
for
the
reason
that
he
consumes
more
food
than
a
person
of
mature
years

also
exerts
a
controlling
influence
a
man
who
works
in

suffers
more
when
placed
in

small
unventilated
room
than
one
who
is
accustomed
to
breathe

of

mention
some
reasons
why
different
persons
do
not
require
the

amount
of
air
in
which
lamps
will
not
burn
with
brilliancy
is
unfitted
for
in
crowded
rooms
which
are
not
ventilated
the
air
is
vitiated
not
only
by
the
abstraction
of
oxygen
and
the
deposition
of
carbonic
acid
but
by
the
excretions
from
the
skin
and
lungs
of
the
audience
the
lamps
under
such
circumstances
emit
but
a
feeble
light
let
the
oxygen
gas
be
more
and
more
expended
and
the
lamps
will
burn
more
and
more
feebly
until
they
are
extinguished
the
effects
of
breathing
the
same
air
again
and
again
are
well
illustrated
by
an
incident
that
occurred
in
one
of
our
halls
of
learning
a
large
audience
had
assembled
in
an
room
to
listen
to
a
lecture
soon
the
lamps
burned
so
dimly
that
the
speaker
and
audience
were
nearly
enveloped
in
darkness
the
oppression
dizziness
and
faintness
experienced
by
many
of
the
audience
induced
them
to
leave
and
in
a
few
minutes
after
the
lamps
were
observed
to
rekindle
owing
to
the
exchange
of
pure
air
on
opening
the
door
how
is
it
with
the
laborer
with
the
gormandizer
with
the
person
that
works
in
the
open
air
what
effect
has
impure
air
on
a
burning
lamp
give
the
illustration
of
the
effects
of
impure
air
on
lighted
lamps
in
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
one
hundred
and
englishmen
were
shut
up
in
a
room
eighteen
feet
square
with
only
two
small
windows
on
the
same
side
to
admit
air
on
opening
this
dungeon
ten
hours
after
their
imprisonment
only
were
alive
the
others
had
died
from
breathing
impure
air
that
has
become
impure
from
the
abstraction
of
oxygen
an
excess
of
carbonic
acid
or
the
excretions
from
the
lungs
and
skin
has
a
deleterious
effect
on
the
when
this
element
is
vitiated
from
the
preceding
causes
it
prevents
the
proper
arterialization
or
change
in
the
blood
for
this
reason
pure
air
should
be
admitted
freely
and
constantly
into
and
and
the
vitiated
air
permitted
to
escape
this
is
of
greater
importance
than
the
warming
of
these
apartments
we
can
compensate
for
the
deficiency
of
a
stove
by
an
extra
garment
or
an
increased
quantity
of
food
but
neither
garment
exercise
nor
food
will
compensate
for
pure
air
should
be
if
they
are
not
the
pupils
will
be
restless
and
complain
of
languor
and
headache
those
unpleasant
sensations
are
caused
by
a
want
of
pure
air
to
give
an
adequate
supply
of
oxygen
to
the
lungs
when
pupils
breathe
for
a
series
of
years
such
vitiated
air
their
life
is
undoubtedly
shortened
by
giving
rise
to
consumption
and
other
fatal
diseases
a

to

per

all
the
air
in
the
room
will
be
vitiated
in
twelve
minutes
in
all
where
there
is
not
adequate

it
is
advisable
to
have
a
recess
of
five
or
ten
minutes
each
hour
during
this
time
let
the
pupils
breathe
fresh
air
and
open
the
doors

so
that
the
air
of
the

shall
be
completely
changed
of
the
effects
of

in
preserving

what
is
of
greater
importance
than
warming
the

why
should

give
the
illustration
concert
halls

all
rooms
designed
for
a
collection
of
individuals
should
be
amply
while
the
architect

are
assiduous
in
giving
these
public

architectural
beauty
and
splendor
by
adorning
the
ceiling
with
gothic
tracery
rearing
richly
carved
columns
and
providing
carefully
for
the

it
too
frequently
happens
that
no
direct

is
made
for
the

a

seat
the
greatest
number
of
persons
regardless
of
the
quantity
and
character
of
the
air
to
maintain
health
and
even
life
the
character
of
the
air
is
only
realized
when
from
the
fresh
pure
air
we
enter
a
crowded
cabin
of
a
boat
or
a
closed
coach
then
the
vitiated
air
from
animal
excretions
and
noxious
gases
is
offensive
and
frequently
produces
sickness
the
influence
of
habit
is
strikingly
expressed
by
birnan
in
the
art
of
warming
and
ventilating
rooms
not
the
least
remarkable
example
of
the
power
of
habit
is
its
reconciling
us
to
practices
which
but
for
its
influence
would
be
considered
noxious
and
disgusting
we
instinctively
shun
approach
to
the
dirty
the
squalid
and
the
diseased
and
use
no
garment
that
may
have
been
worn
by
another

for
matters
that
offend
the
sight
or
the

we
carefully
remove
impurities
from
what
we
eat
and
drink
filter
turbid
water

fastidiously
avoid
drinking
from
a
cup
that
may
have
been
pressed
to
the
lips
of
a
friend
on
the

resort
to

into

air
loaded
with
effluvia
from
the

of
every
individual
in
the
promiscuous
crowd
exhalations
offensive
to
a

extent
from

healthy
individuals

what
is

prevent

observation
by
many

apartments
twelve

for
two
persons
and
good
accommodations
for

apartment
of
this
size
contains
cubic
feet
of
air
allowing
ten
cubic
feet
to
each
person
per
minute
two
occupants
would
vitiate
the
air
of
the
room
in
fifty
minutes
and
four
in
minutes
when
are
not
ventilated
we
would
strongly
recommend
early
rising
particularly
should
be
so
arranged
that
the
impure
air
may
escape
and
pure
air
be
constantly
admitted
into
the
it
is
no
unusual
practice
in
some
communities
when
a
child
or
an
adult
is
sick
of
an
acute
disease
to
prevent
the
ingress
of
pure
air
simply
from
the
apprehension
of
the
attendants
that
the
patient
will
contract
a
cold
again
the
prevalent
custom
of
several
individuals
sitting
in
the
particularly
when
they
remain
there
for
several
hours
tends
to
vitiate
the
air
and
consequently
to
increase
the
suffering
and
danger
of
the
sick
person
in
fevers
or
inflammatory
diseases
of
any
kind
let
the
patient
breathe
pure
air
for
the
purer

blood
the

power
of
the
system
to
remove
disease
and
the
less

liability
to
contract
colds
among
children
convulsions
or
fits
usually
occur
when
they
are
sleeping
in
many
instances
these
are
produced
by
the
impure
air
which
is
breathed
to
prevent
these
alarming
and
distressing
convulsions
the
should
be
ventilated
and
there
should
be
no
curtains
around
the
bed
or
coverings
over
the
face
as
they
produce
an
effect
similar
to
that
experienced
when
sleeping
in
a
small

room

of
the
mention
some
prevailing
customs
in
reference
to
these
rooms
what
is
said
of
convulsions
among
children
occupying
a
room
we
are
insensible
of
the
gradual
vitiation
of
the
this
is
the
result
of
the
diminished
sensibility
of
the
nervous
system
and
gradual
adaptation
of
the
organs
to
blood
of
a
less
stimulating
character
this
condition
is
well
illustrated
in
the
hibernating
animals
we
are
insensible
of
the
impure
air
of
unventilated
until
we
leave
them
for
a
walk
or
ride
if
they
have
been
closed
we
are
made
sensible
of
the
character
of
the
air
as
soon
as
we
reënter
them
for
the
system
has
regained
its
usual
sensibility
while
inhaling
a
purer
atmosphere
the
construction
of
every
inhabited
room
there
should
be
adequate
means
of
ventilation
as
well
as
no
room
is
well
ventilated
unless
as
much
pure
air
is
brought
into
it
as
the
occupants
vitiate
at
every
respiration
this
can
be
effected
by
making
an
aperture
in
the
ceiling
of
the
room
or
by
constructing
a
ventilating
flue
in
the
chimney
this
should
be
in
contact
with
the
flues
for
the
escape
of
smoke
but
separated
from
them
by
a
thin
brick
partition
the
hot
air
in
the
smoke
flues
will
warm
the
separating
brick
partition
and
consequently
rarefy
the
air
in
the
ventilating
flue
communication
from
every
room
in
a
house
should
be
had
to
such
flues
the
draught
of
air
can
be
regulated
by
registers
which
in
large
rooms
should
be
placed
near
the
floor
as
well
as
near
the
ceiling
while
provision
is
made
for
the
escape
of
rarefied
impure
air
we
should
also
provide
means
by
which
pure
air
may
be
constantly
admitted
into
the
room
as
the
crevices
of
the
doors
and
windows
are
not
always
sufficient
and
if
they
should
be
adequate
air
can
be
introduced
in
a
more
convenient
economical
and
appropriate
manner
there
should
be
an
aperture
opposite
the
ventilating
flue
at
or
near
the
floor
to
connect
with
the
outer
walls
of
the
building
or
external
air
but
if
pure
heated
air
is
introduced
into
the
room
it
obviates
the
necessity
of
the
introduction
of

frederick

and

apparatus
for
removing

this
perverted
taste
is
in
opposition
to

the
design
of
the
human

is
not
simply
to
connect
the
upper

of

to
form
a
case
for
the

of

have
small

from

it

the

the
necessity

may
he
elucidated
by
the
following
experiment
suppose
a
gill
of
alcohol
mixed
with
a
gill
of
water
be
put
into
a
vessel
having
a
square
foot
of
surface
and
over
the
vessel
a
membrane
be
tied
and
that
the
water
will
evaporate
in
hours
if
the
surface
had
been
only
six
inches
square
only
one
fourth
of
the
water
would
have
evaporated
through
the
membrane
in
the
given
time
if
the
surface
had
been
extended
to
two
square
feet
the
water
would
have
evaporated
in
twelve
hours
apply
this
principle
to
the
lungs
suppose
there
are
two
hundred
feet
of
carbonic
acid
to
be
carried
out
of
the
system
every
hours
this
gas
in
that
time
will
pass
through
a
vesicular
membrane
of
two
thousand
square
feet
if
the
lungs
were
diminished
in
size
so
that
there
would
be
only
one
thousand
square
feet
of
vesicular
membrane
the
amount
of
carbonic
acid
would
not
and
could
not
be
eliminated
from
the
system
under
such
circumstances
the
blood
would
not
be
purified
again
suppose
the
two
thousand
square
feet
of
membrane
would
transmit
two
hundred
cubic
feet
of
oxygen
into
the
system
every
hours
if
it
should
be
diminished
one
half
this
amount
of
oxygen
would
not
pass
into
the
blood
from
the
above
illustrations
we
may
learn
the
importance
of
chests
and
voluminous
lungs
for
by
increasing
the
size
of
the
lungs
the
oxygen
is
more
abundantly
supplied
to
the
blood
and
this
fluid
is
more
perfectly
deprived
of
its
carbon
and
hydrogen
what
does
this
hereditary
transmission
prove
how
is
the
necessity
of
voluminous
lungs
illustrated
how
is
this
principle
applied
to
the
interchange
of
products
in
the
lungs
the
chest
is
not
only
most
expanded
at
its
lower
part
but
the
portion
of
the
lungs
that
occupies
this
space
of
the
thoracic
cavity
contains
the
greater
part
of
the
and
from
the
lower
two
thirds
of
the
lungs
the
greatest
amount
of
carbonic
acid
is
abstracted
from
the
blood
and
the
greatest
amount
of
oxygen
gas
is
conveyed
into
the
circulating
fluid
hence
contracting
the
lower
ribs
is
far
more
injurious
to
the
health
than
diminishing
the
size
of
the
upper
part
of
the
chest
the
question
is
often
asked
can
the
size
of
the
chest
and
the
volume
of
the
lungs
be
increased
when
they
have
been
injudiciously
compressed
or
have
inherited
this
unnatural
form
the
answer
is
in
the
affirmative
the
means
for
attaining
this
end
are
a
judicious
exercise
of
the
lungs
by
walking
in
the
open
air
reading
aloud
singing
sitting
erect
and
fully
inflating
the
lungs
at
each
act
of
inspiration
if
the
exercise
be
properly
managed
and
persevered
in
it
will
expand
the
chest
and
give
tone
and
health
to
the
important
organs
contained
in
it
but
if
the
exercise
be
or
carried
to
excess
the
beneficial
results
sought
will
probably
not
be
attained
scholars
and
persons
who
sit
much
of
the
time
should
frequently
during
the
day
breathe
full
and
deep
so
that
the
smallest
may
be
fully
filled
with
air
while
exercising
the
lungs
the
shoulders
should
be
thrown
back
and
the
head
held
erect
movement
of
the
ribs
and
diaphragm
is
modified
by
the
when
the
lungs
are
properly
filled
with
air
the
chest
is
enlarged
in
every
direction
if
any
article
of
apparel
is
worn
so
tight
as
to
prevent
the
full
expansion
of
the
chest
and
abdomen
the
lungs
in
consequence
do
not
receive
air
sufficient
to
purify
the
blood
the
effect
of
firm
unyielding
clothing
when
worn
tight
in
preventing
a
due
supply
of
air
to
the
lungs
may
be
shown
by
the
following
illustration
why
is
it
more
injurious
to
contract
the
lower
part
of
the
chest
than
the
upper
how
can
the
size
of
the
chest
be
increased
when
it
is
contracted
give
the
observation
how
is
the
movement
of
the
ribs
and
diaphragm
modified
if
the
diameter
of
a
circle
is
three
feet
the
circumference
will
be
nine
feet
if
the
diameter
is
extended
to
four
feet
the
circumference
will
be
increased
to
twelve
feet
should
a
tight
band
be
thrown
around
a
circle
of
nine
feet
its
diameter
can
not
be
increased
for
the
circumference
can
not
be
enlarged
any
inelastic
band
drawn
closely
around
the
lower
part
of
the
chest
or
the
abdomen
below
the
ribs
operates
like
the
band
in
the
preceding
illustration
in
restricting
the
movement
of
the
ribs
when
any
article
of
dress
encircles
either
the
chest
or
abdomen
so
as
to
prevent
an
increase
of
its
circumference
it
has
an
injudicious
tendency
as
it
prevents
the
introduction
of
air
in
sufficient
quantities
to
purify
the
blood
the
question
is
not
how
much
restriction
of
the
respiratory
movements
can
be
endured
and
life
continue
but
does
any
part
of
the
apparel
restrict
the
movements
if
it
does
it
is
a
violation
of
the
organic
laws
and
though
nature
is
profuse
in
her
expenditures
yet
sooner
or
later
she
sums
up
her
account
in
determining
whether
the
apparel
is
worn
too
tight
inflate
the
lungs
and
if
no
pressure
is
felt
no
injurious
effects
need
be
apprehended
from
this
cause
in
testing
the
tightness
of
the
dress
some
persons
will
contract
to
the
utmost
the
abdominal
muscles
and
thus
diminish
the
size
of
the
chest
by
depressing
the
ribs
when
this
is
done
the
individual
exclaims
how
loose
my
dress
is
this
practice
is
both
deceptive
and
ludicrous
a
good
test
is
to
put
the
hand
on
the
chest
below
the
arm
if
there
is
no
movement
of
the
ribs
during
respiration
the
apparel
is
too
tight
the
only
reliable
test
however
is
a
full
inflation
of
the
lungs
how
is
the
effect
of
unyielding
clothing
when
worn
tight
illustrated
what
effect
has
an
inelastic
band
upon
the
lower
part
of
the
chest
what
question
is
asked
how
can
we
determine
whether
the
apparel
is
worn
too
tight
many
individuals
do
not
realize
the
small
amount
of
force
that
will
prevent
the
enlargement
of
the
chest
this
can
be
demonstrated
by
drawing
a
piece
of
tape
tightly
around
the
lower
part
of
the
chest
of
a
vigorous
adult
and
confining
it
with
the
thumb
and
finger
then
endeavor
fully
to
inflate
the
lungs
and
the
movement
of
the
ribs
will
be
much
restricted
position
in
standing
and
sitting
influences
the
movement
of
the
ribs
and
when
the
shoulders
are
thrown
back
and
when
a
person
stands
or
sits
erect
the
diaphragm
and
ribs
have
more
freedom
of
motion
and
the
abdominal
muscles
act
more
efficiently
thus
the
lungs
have
broader
range
of
movement
than
when
the
shoulders
incline
forward
and
the
body
is
stooping
exercises
an
influence
upon
the
range
of
the
respiratory
a
person
who
has
been
habituated
to
dress
loosely
and
whose
inspirations
are
full
and
free
suffers
more
from
the
tightness
of
a
vest
or
waistband
than
one
the
range
of
movements
of
whose
chest
has
long
been
subjected
to
tight
lacing
condition
of
the
brain
exercises
a
great
influence
upon
if
the
brain
is
diseased
or
the
mind
depressed
by
grief
tormented
by
anxiety
or
absorbed
by
abstract
thought
the
contractile
energy
of
the
diaphragm
and
muscles
that
elevate
the
ribs
is
much
diminished
and
the
lungs
are
not
so
fully
inflated
as
when
the
mind
is
influenced
by
joy
or
other
exhilarating
emotions
the
depressing
passions
likewise
lessen
the
frequency
of
respiration
by
the
influence
of
these
causes
the
blood
is
but
partially
purified
and
the
whole
system
becomes
enfeebled
here
we
may
see
the
admirable
harmony
between
the
different
parts
of
the
body
and
the
adaptation
of
all
the
functions
to
each
other

another
test

to
prevent

state
the
influence
of
the
mind
upon
respiration
as
the
quantity
of
air
inhaled
at
each
unimpeded
inspiration
in
lungs
of
ample
size
is
about
forty
cubic
inches
it
follows
if
the
movement
of
the
ribs
and
diaphragm
is
restricted
by
an
enfeebled
action
of
the
respiratory
muscles
or
by
any
other
means
the
blood
will
not
be
perfectly
purified
in
the
experiment
suppose
forty
cubic
inches
of
air
must
pass
over
the
membrane
twenty
times
every
minute
and
that
this
is
the
amount
required
to
remove

vapor
which
arises
from
the
membrane
if
only
half
of
this
amount

be
supplied
each
minute
only
one
half
as
much
water
will
be
removed
from
the
alcohol
through
the
membrane
in
hours
consequently
the
alcohol
would
be
impure
from
the
water
not
being
entirely
removed
restrain
the
elevation
of
the
ribs
and
depression
of
the
diaphragm
so
that
the
quantity
of
air
conveyed
into
the
lungs
will
be
reduced
to
twenty
cubic
inches
when
forty
are
needed
and
the
results
will
be
as
follows
only
one
half
of
the
carbonic
acid
will
be
eliminated
from
the
system
and
the
blood
will
receive
but
one
half
as
much
oxygen
as
it
requires
this
fluid
will
then
be
imperfectly
oxydated
and
partially
freed
of
its
impurities
the
impure
blood
will
be
returned
to
the
left
side
of
the

and
the
whole

will
suffer
from
an
infringement

a
striking
instance
of
the
effects
of
mental

is
related
by
lænnec
in
a
female
religious
establishment
in
france
great
austerities
were
practised
the
mind
was
absorbed
in
contemplating
the
terrible
truths
of
religion
and
in
mortifying
the
flesh
the
whole
establishment
in
the
space
of
ten
years
was
several
times
depopulated
with
the
exception
of
the
persons
employed
at
the

in

with
that
fatal
disease
consumption
this
institution
did
not
long
continue
but
was
suppressed
by
order
of
the
french
government
purity
of
the

is
influenced
by
the
condition
of
the
when
the
bronchial
tubes
and
have
become
partially
impervious
to
air
from
pressure
upon
the

from

the

even
if
the

attacked
with

by
which
these
organs
were
consolidated
and
thus
prevented
the
permeation
of

into
their

this
disease
of
the

was
caused
by
breathing
vitiated
air
mention
some
of

is
related
by
lænnec

mention
some
of
the
conditions
that

what
occurred
to
those
persons
who
escaped
death
in
the
black
hole
of

one
of
the
precursory
symptoms
of
consumption
is
the
feeble
murmur
of
respiration
in
the
upper
part
of
the
lungs
this
condition
of
these
organs
is
produced
by
or
frequently
follows
mental
depression
the
breathing
of
impure
air
the
stooping
position
in
standing
or
sitting
and
the
restriction
of
the
movements
of
the
ribs
and

persons
asphyxiated
by
carbonic
acid
water
strangling
or
any
noxious
air
after
resuscitation
are
usually
affected
with
coughs
and
other
diseases
of
the
lungs
colds
and
coughs
are
generally
induced
by
a
chill
that
produces
a
contraction
of
the
of
the
skin
and
the
waste
material
which
should
be
carried
from
the
body
by
the
agency
of
the
vessels
of
this
membrane
is
retained
in
the
system
and
a
great
portion
of
it
is
returned
to
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
lungs
for
such
is
the
harmony
established
by
the
creator
that
if
the
function
of
any
portion
of
the
body
is
deranged
those
organs
whose
offices
are
similar
take
on
an
increased
action
the
waste
material
that
should
have
passed
through
the
many
outlets
of
the
skin
creates
an
unusual
fulness
of
the
minute
vessels
that
nourish
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
bronchia
this
induces
an
irritation
of
these
vessels
which
increases
the
flow
of
blood
to
the
nutrient
arteries
of
the
lungs
there
is
also
a
thickening
of
the
lining
membrane
of
the
lungs
caused
by
the
repletion
of
the
bronchial
vessels
of
the
mucous
membrane
this
impedes
the
passage
of
air
through
the
small
bronchial
tubes
and
consequently
the
can
not
impart
a
sufficient
quantity
of
oxygen
to
purify
the
blood
and
this
fluid
imperfectly
purified
does
not
pass
with
facility
through
the
lungs
an
additional
obstacle
to
the
free
passage
of
air
into
the
lungs
is
the
accumulation
of
blood
in
the
pulmonary
vessels
what
is
one
of
the
precursory
symptoms
of
consumption
how
is
this
condition
frequently
produced
what
diseases
usually
follow
asphyxia
by
carbonic
acid
water
strangling
how
are
colds
generally
induced
what
effect
has
a
common
cold
upon
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
lungs
as
colds
and
coughs
are
very
generally
treated
by
the
matrons
of
the
community
or
by
the
patient
the
following
suggestions
may
aid
in
directing
a
proper
treatment
to
effect
a
speedy
cure
it
is
necessary
to
diminish
the
amount
of
fluid
in
the
vessels
of
the
lungs
this
can
be
effected
in
two
ways
by
diminishing
the
quantity
of
blood
in
the
system
by
diverting
it
from
the
lungs
to
the
skin
the
first
condition
can
be
easily
and
safely
affected
by
abstaining
from
food
and
drinking
no
more
than
a
gill
of
fluid
in
hours
as
there
is
a
continuous
waste
from
the
skin
and
other
organs
of
the
system
the
quantity
of
blood
by
this
procedure
will
be
diminished
and
the
lungs
relieved
of
the
accumulated
fluid
the
second
condition
can
be
accomplished
by
resorting
to
the
warm
or
vapor
bath
these
and
the
common
sweats
will
invite
the
blood
from
the
lungs
to
the
skin
by

animal
heat
the
true
sources
of
animal
heat
or
calorification
are
still
imperfectly
known
no
hypothesis
has
as
yet
received
the
concurrent
assent
of
physiologists
we
see
certain
phenomena
but
the
ultimate
causes
are
hidden
from
our
view
its
regular
production
to
a
certain
degree
is
essential
both
to
animal
and
vegetable
life
there
is
a
tendency
between
bodies
of
different
temperature
to
an
equilibrium
of
heat
thus
if
we
touch
or
approach
a
hot
body
the
heat
or
caloric
passes
from
that
body
to
our
organs
of
feeling
and
gives
the
sensation
of
heat
on
the
contrary
when
we
touch
a
cold
body
the
heat
passes
from
the
hand
to
that
body
and
causes
a
sensation
of
cold
the
greater
number
of
animals
appear
cold
when
we
touch
them
and
indeed
the
temperature
of
their
bodies
is
not
much
above
that
of
the
atmosphere
and
changes
with
it
in
man
and
other
animals
that
approach
him
in
their
organization
it
is
otherwise
they
have
the
faculty
of
producing
a
sufficient
quantity
of
caloric
to
maintain
their
temperatures
nearly
at
the
same
degree
under
all
atmospheric
changes
and
keep
themselves
warm
those
animals
whose
proper
heat
is
not
very
perceivable
are
called
as
most
species
of
fishes
toads
snakes
turtles
and
reptiles
generally
those
animals
which
produce
sufficient
heat
independently
of
the
atmosphere
surrounding

are
called
as
man

explanation
what
is

of
the
temperature
of
animals
what
is
meant
by
animals
by
animals
the
temperature
of

is
about
fahrenheit

and
that
of
some
other
animals
is
higher
the
temperature
of
birds
for
example

about
it
is
obvious
that
in
most
parts
of
the
globe
the
heat
of
the
atmosphere
is
even
in
summer
less
than
that
of
the
human
body
in
our
latitude
the
mercury
rarely
attains

sometimes
it
descends
to
several
degrees

these
were

about

captain
lyon
who
accompanied
captain
parry
in
his
second
voyage
to
the
northern
regions
found
the
temperature
of
an
arctic
fox
to
be
while
that
of
the
atmosphere
was
below
zero
making
a
difference
between
the
temperature
of
the
fox
and
that
of
the
atmosphere
of
captain
scoresby
found
the
temperature
of
a
whale
in
the
arctic
ocean
to
be
or
nearly
as
high
as
that
of
other
animals
of
the
same
kind

region
of
the
equator
while
the
temperature
of
the
ice
was
as
low
as

the

was

these
facts
show
what
a
strong
counteracting
energy
there
is
in
animals
against
the
effects
of
cold
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
ascertained
by
numerous
and
experiments
that
the
human
body
can
be
exposed
even
for
a
length
of
time
to
a
very
high
temperature

certain
that
there
was
no
fallacy
says
sir
charles
blagden
in
the
degree
of
heat
shown
by

that
the

breathed
was
capable
of

the

nostrils
though
it

hot
when

did
not
the

possess
within
itself
the
power
of
generating

removing
heat
so
as
to
maintain

an
equality
of

the
most
fatal
consequences
would
ensue
in
northern

especially
in

weather
of

the

would
be
converted
into
a
solid
mass
and
on
the
other
hand
the
fatty
secretion
when
subjected
to

heat
would
become
fluid
and
life
would
be
extinguished
what
is
related
of
chantrey
of
chaubert
of
sir
charles
blagden
give
sir
charles
own
statement
what
is
said
of
the
temperature
of
the
human
tongue
mention
the
experiment
by
sir
charles
blagden
what
would
be
the
effect
if
the
human
system
did
not
maintain
an
equality
of
temperature
to
enable
man
and
other
animals
to
maintain
this
equilibrium
of
temperature
under
such
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
naturally
suggests
two
inquiries
by
what
organs
is
animal
heat
generated
by
what
means
is
its
uniformity
maintained
the
ancients
had
no
theory
on
the
subject
of
animal
heat
they
believed
that
the
chief
object
of
respiration
was
to
cool
the
blood
and
that
the
heart
was
the
great
furnace
where
all
the
heat
was
generated
at
a
later
period
mayow
from
his
discoveries
respecting
respiration
asserted
that
the
object
of
respiration
was
to
produce
heat
and
denied
that
the
blood
was
cooled
in
the
lungs
when
it
was
discovered
that
both
in
combustion
and
respiration
carbonic
acid
was
produced
and
oxygen
absorbed
it
led
black
to
conclude
that
breathing
was
a
kind
of
combustion
by
which
all
the
heat
of
the
body
was
produced
this
theory
was
objected
to
because
if
all
the
heat
was
generated
in
the
lungs
like
those
parts
of
a
stove
in
contact
with
the
fuel
they
would
be
at
a
higher
temperature
than
those
parts
at
a
distance
which
was
known
not
to
exist
the
next
theory
and
one
which
received
the
sanction
of
the
scientific
men
of
europe
was
proposed
by
crawford
he
agreed
with
black
that
heat
not
only
was
generated
in
the
lungs
but
that
the
arterial
blood
had
a
greater
capacity
for
heat
than
the
venous
and
that
this
increase
of
capacity
takes
place
in
the
lungs
at
the
moment
heat
is
generated
a
portion
of
it
under
the
name
of
latent
heat
is
absorbed
and
conveyed
to
the
different
parts
of
the
body
wherever
arterial
blood
is
converted
into
venous
this
latent
heat
is
given
out
but
unfortunately
for
this
theory
davy
proved
the
capacity
of
both
for
heat
to
be
nearly
the
same
what
inquiries
are
naturally
suggested
what
was
the
theory
of
the
ancients
what
did
mayow
assert
at
a
later
period
what
was
the
theory
of
black
the
objection
what
was
the
theory
of
dr
crawford
no
one
can
doubt
that
respiration
and
animal
heat
are
closely
connected
those
animals
whose
respiratory
apparatus
is
the
most
extended
have
the
highest
temperature
an
example
is
seen
in
birds
whose
organs
of
respiration
extend
over
a
large
part
of
the
body
and
their
temperature
is
above
man
while
the
respiratory
apparatus
of
animals
as
some
kinds
of
fish
is
imperfect
and
only
a
small
quantity
of
blood
is
subjected
at
any
time
to
the
effects
of
respiration
to
understand
the
process
by
which
heat
is
generated
in
the
human
system
and
in
animals
it
will
be
necessary
to
state
that
the
apparent
heat
of
a
body
as
perceived
by
the
touch
or
as
indicated
by
a
thermometer
is
not
the
measurement
of
heat
contained
in
the
body
or
its
capacity
for
heat
if
we
mix
one
pound
of
water
at
the
temperature
of
with
another
pound
at
the
resulting
temperature
will
be
exactly
the
medium
or
but
if
we
mix
a
pound
of
water
at
with
a
pound
of
quicksilver
at
the
resulting
temperature
will
be
only
because
the
capacity
of
water
for
heat
is
so
much
greater
than
that
of
quicksilver
that
the
heat
which
raised
the
quicksilver
will
raise
the
water
only
when
the
density
and
the
arrangement
of
the
atoms
of
a
body
are
changed
its
capacity
to
hold
heat
in
a
latent
state
is
altered
if
it
will
retain
more
heat
will
be
absorbed
from
contiguous
and
surrounding
substances
but
if
its
capacity
for
caloric
is
lessened
heat
will
be
set
free
and
given
out
to
surrounding
bodies
the
objection
in
what
do
all
the
physiologists
of
the
present
day
concur
how
is
it
proved
that
respiration
and
animal
heat
are
closely
connected
what
is
said
of
the
apparent
heat
of
bodies
how
is
this
illustrated
what
is
the
effect
when
the
density
and
the
arrangement
of
the
atoms
of
a
body
are
changed
ice
and
salt
chl
of
sodium
when
mixed
are
converted
into
a
fluid
in
this
state
they
will
hold
more
heat
than
when
solid
the
heat
necessary
to
produce
this
change
is
drawn
from
the
surrounding
medium
which
is
made
proportionally
colder
by
the
loss
of
caloric
imparted
to
the
ice
and
salt
it
is
by
this
chemical
process
that
is
made
on
the
other
hand
mix
water
and
sulphuric
acid
oil
of
vitriol
of
the
temperature
of
and
the
mixture
will
become
quite
warm
and
will
freely
impart
its
heat
to
surrounding
and
contiguous
objects
the
same
principle
is
exhibited
when
oxygen
unites
with
an
inflammable
body
as
in
the
burning
of
wood
coal
oil
in
combustion
the
oxygen
of
the
atmosphere
unites
with
carbon
and
hydrogen
and
carbonic
acid
and
water
are
produced
this
process
according
to
all
the
known
laws
of
caloric
is
attended
with
heat
the
quantity
of
heat
disengaged
in
combustion
is
always
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
carbon
and
hydrogen
consumed
thus
a
piece
of
wood
weighing
one
pound
in
burning
slowly
would
give
out
the
same
quantity
of
heat
as
a
pound
of
shavings
of
the
same
wood
in
burning
rapidly
upon
these
principles
the
production
of
animal
heat
may
be
understood
the
food
contains
carbon
and
hydrogen
these
exist
in
the
chyle
the
old
and
waste
atoms
of
the
body
likewise
contain
the
same
elements
in
the
lungs
the
oxygen
and
nitrogen
of
the
inspired
air
are
separated
it
is
now
supposed
that
the
oxygen
enters
the
capillary
vessels
of
the
lungs
and
mingles
with
the
blood
with
which
it
is
carried
to
the
heart
and
thence
to
the
nutrient
capillary
vessels
of
every
part
of
the
system
give
the
illustration
the
what
changes
take
place
when
oxygen
unites
with
an
inflammable
body
to
what
is
the
quantity
of
heat
proportionate
in
combustion
give
an
example
how
are
carbon
and
hydrogen
supplied
to
the
system
how
the
oxygen
where
does
the
oxygen
mingle
with
the
blood
in
the
capillary
vessels
the
oxygen
of
the
arterial
blood
unites
with
the
carbon
and
hydrogen
which
the
refuse
materials
contain
and
carbonic
acid
and
water
are
formed
the
combustion
of
carbon
and
hydrogen
in
the
capillaries
of
every
part
of
the
system
the
lungs
not
excepted
is
attended
with
a
disengagement
of
heat
and
the
carbonic
acid
and
water
are
returned
to
the
lungs
in
the
blood
and
evolved
from
the
system
sir
benjamin
brodie
and
some
others
have
maintained
that
the
heat
of
the
system
is
generated
exclusively
by
the
influence
of
the
brain
and
nerves
this
theory
is
discarded
by
most
physiologists
yet
it
is
true
that
the
nervous
system
exercises
a
great
influence
over
the
action
of
the
capillary
vessels
in
the
process
of
nutrition
secretion
and
absorption
when
these
operations
are
most
active
the
change
among
the
particles
of
matter
of
which
the
body
is
composed
is
then
greatest
and
the
generation
of
heat
is
increased
in
a
corresponding
degree
the
necessity
of
pure
red
blood
in
the
production
of
animal
heat
is
shown
when
the
vessels
that
carry
blood
to
a
limb
are
ligated
or
tied
the
part
immediately
becomes
colder
the
necessity
of
nervous
influence
is
seen
in
the
diminished
temperature
of
a
paralytic
limb
our
next
inquiry
is
by
what
means
is
the
uniformity
of
temperature
in
the
body
maintained
as
there
is
a
constant
generation
of
heat
in
the
system
there
would
be
an
undue
accumulation
so
much
so
as
to
cause
disagreeable
sensations
if
there
were
no
means
by
which
it
could
be
evolved
from
the
body
or
its
production
lessened
where
does
it
unite
with
the
carbon
and
hydrogen
contained
in
the
body
and
how
is
heat
generated
what
was
the
theory
of
sir
benjamin
brodie
is
this
theory
in
general
discarded
what
is
true
of
this
theory
how
is
the
necessity
of
pure
red
blood
and
nervous
action
shown
in
the
production
of
animal
heat
it
has
been
ascertained
that
the
principal
means
by
which
the
system
is
kept
at
a
uniform
temperature
is
the
immense
evaporation
from
the
skin
and
lungs
these
membranes
in
an
ordinary
state
are
constantly
giving
out
water
which
is
converted
into
vapor
and
carried
off
by
the
surrounding
air
the
quantity
of
heat
abstracted
from
the
system
to
effect
this
depends
on
the
rapidity
of
the
change
of
air
its
temperature
and
the
amount
of
water
it
contains
in
a
state
of
vapor
the
quantity
removed
is
greatest
when
the
air
is
warm
and
dry
and
the
change
or
current
rapid
the
first
discovery
of
the
use
of
free
evaporation
of
the
perspiration
from
the
skin
in
reducing
the
heat
of
the
body
and
the
analogy
subsisting
between
this
process
and
that
of
the
evaporation
of
water
from
a
rough
porous
surface
so
constantly
resorted
to
in
warm
countries
as
an
efficacious
means
of
reducing
the
temperature
of
the
air
in
rooms
and
of
wine
and
other
drinks
much
below
that
of
the
surrounding
atmosphere
was
made
by
franklin
in
all
ages
and
climes
it
has
been
observed
that
the
increased
temperature
of
the
skin
and
system
in
fevers
is
abated
as
soon
as
free
perspiration
is
restored
in
damp
close
weather
as
during
the
sultry
days
of
august
although
the
temperature
is
lower
we
feel
a
disagreeable
sensation
of
heat
because
the
saturation
of
the
air
with
moisture
lessens
evaporation
and
thus
prevents
the
escape
of
heat
through
the
lungs
and
skin
it
is
on
the
principle
of
the
evaporation
of
fluids
that
warm
vinegar
and
water
applied
to
the
burning
aching
head
cools
it
and
imparts
to
it
a
comfortable
feeling
the
same
results
follow
if
warm
liquids
are
applied
to
the
skin
in
the
hot
stage
of
fever
and
this
evaporation
can
be
increased
by
constant
fanning
what
are
the
principal
means
by
which
a
uniform
temperature
of
the
body
is
maintained
on
what
does
the
quantity
of
heat
abstracted
from
the
system
depend
what
discovery
relative
to
animal
heat
is
due
to
franklin
what
is
said
of
free
perspiration
in
fevers
what
occasions
the
disagreeable
sensation
of
heat
in
damp
close
weather
it
is
frequently
noticed
in
very
warm
weather
that
dogs
and
other
domestic
animals
are
seen
with
their
tongues
out
of
their
mouths
and
covered
with
frothy
secretions
this
is
merely
another
mode
of
reducing
animal
heat
as
the
skin
of
such
animals
does
not
perspire
as
much
as
that
of
man
under
some
circumstances
a
portion
of
the
heat
of
the
system
is
removed
by
radiation
when
cold
air
comes
in
contact
with
the
skin
and
mucous
membrane
of
the
lungs
heat
is
removed
from
the
body
as
from
a
stove
to
restore
an
equilibrium
of
temperature
the
removal
of
heat
from
the
body
is
greatest
when
we
are
in
a
current
of
cold
air
or
when
a
brisk
cold
wind
is
blowing
upon
us
as
the
primary
object
of
the
different
processes
of
nutrition
is
to
supply
animal
heat
so
the
action
of
the
different
nutritive
organs
is
modified
by
the
demands
of
the
system
for
heat
when
heat
is
rapidly
removed
from
the
body
the
functional
activity
of
the
organs
of
nutrition
is
increased
when
the
system
is
warmed
by
foreign
influence
the
activity
of
the
nutritive
organs
is
diminished
this
leads
to
the
natural
and
we
may
add
instinctive
change
in
the
quality
and
quantity
of
food
at
different
seasons
of
the

hygiene
of
animal
heat
the
amount
of
heat
generated
in
man
and
inferior
animals
depends
upon
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
food
age
exercise
the
amount
and
character
of
the
respired
air
condition
of
the
brain
skin
and
general
system
heat
is
modified
by
the
proportion
of
digestible
carbon
which
the
food
contains
and
by
the
quantity
as
the
kind
of
fuel
that
contains
the
greatest
amount
of
combustible
material
evolves
the
most
caloric
when
burned
so
those
articles
of
food
that
contain
the
greatest
quantity
of
carbon
produce
the
most
heat
when
converted
into
blood
the
inhabitants
of
the
frigid
zones
and
individuals
in
temperate
climates
during
the
cold
season
consume
with
impunity
stimulating
animal
food
that
contains
a
large
proportion
of
carbon
while
the
inhabitants
of
the
tropical
regions
and
persons
in
temperate
climates
during
the
warm
season
are
more
healthy
with
a
less
stimulating
or
vegetable
diet
when
we
ride
or
labor
in
cold
weather
an
adequate
amount
of
nutritious
food
will
sustain
the
warmth
of
the
system
better
than
intoxicating
drinks
is
another
influence
that
modifies
the
generation
of
animal
the
vital
forces
of
the
child
being
feeble
less
heat
is
generated
in
its
system
than
in
that
of
an
adult
the
experiments
of
milne
edwards
show
that
the
power
of
producing
heat
in
animals
is
at
its
minimum
at
birth
and
increases
successively
to
adult
age
and
that
young
children
part
with
their
heat
more
readily
than
adults
and
instead
of
being
warmer
are
generally
a
degree
or
two
colder
after
adult
age
as
the
vital
powers
decline
the
generation
of
heat
is
diminished
as
the
energies
of
the
system
are
lessened
hence
the
young
child
and
the
debilitated
aged
person
need
more
clothing
than
the
vigorous
individual
of
middle
age
the
hygiene
of
animal
state
some
of
the
influences
that
modify
the
generation
of
animal
heat
what
element
of
the
food
influences
the
generation
of
heat
when
and
where
can
animal
food
be
eaten
with
impunity
give
the
practical
observation
is
an
influence
that
modifies
the
generation
of
animal
as
carbon
and
hydrogen
enter
into
the
composition
of
the
organs
of
the
body
whatever
increases
the
flow
of
blood
in
the
system
increases
also
the
deposition
of
new
material
and
the
removal
of
the
waste
particles
this
change
among
the
particles
of
matter
is
attended
with
an
elevation
of
temperature
from
the
union
of
oxygen
with
the
carbon
and
hydrogen
of
the
waste
atoms
for
this
reason
a
person
in
action
is
warmer
than
in
a
quiescent
state
consequently
the
amount
of
clothing
should
be
increased
when
exercise
or
labor
is
diminished
or
suspended
on
the
other
hand
whatever
impedes
the
circulation
and
the
interchange
of
the
atoms
of
matter
diminishes
animal
heat
common
observation
shows
that
the
extremities
are
not
as
warm
when
tight
gloves
or
boots
are
worn
as
when
they
are
loose
one
reason
is
the
circulation
of
blood
is
impeded
which
is
attended
with
less
frequent
change
of
the
particles
of

quantity
of

which
is
inhaled
modifies
the
heat
of
the
in
the
generation
of
heat
in
a
stove
air
or
oxygen
is
as
essential
as
the
wood
or
coal
it
is
equally
so
in
the
production
of
animal
heat
the
oxygen
of
the
inspired
air
should
be
in
proportion
to
the
carbon
and
hydrogen
to
be
consumed
this
requires
voluminous
lungs
together
with
free
movements
of
the
ribs
and
diaphragm
a
person
whose
chest
is
small
and
whose
apparel
is
worn
tight
over
the
ribs
suffers
more
from
the
cold
and
complains
more
frequently
of
chilliness
and
cold
extremities
than
the

their
temperature
is
not
much
greater
than
the
medium
in
which
they
live
whales
dolphins
breathe
by
means
of

and
the
inhalation
of

air
makes
their
temperature
about
independent

influences
the
generation
of

in
vestries
and
other
public
rooms
when
crowded
with
an
audience
where
the
ventilation
is
inadequate
the
lamps
will
emit
but
a
faint
light
because
the
oxygen
is
soon
expended
and
there
is
not
enough
of
the
vivifying
principle
to
unite
with
the
oil
and
disengage
light
in
the
human
body
when
the
respired
air
has
lost
some
of
its
properties
the
combustion
that
takes
place
in
different
parts
of
the
system
is
not
so
complete
as
when
it
contains
a
proper
proportion
of
oxygen
and
hence
less
heat
is
disengaged
for
this
reason
those
persons
that
breathe
impure

either
in
the
daytime
or
night
require
more
clothing
than
those
that

if
the

is
diseased
or
the

is
absorbed
in

depressed
by
sorrow
or
aroused
from
fear
the
breathing
becomes
slow
and
scarcely
perceptible
and
a
chilliness
pervades
the
body
particularly
the
extremities
while
on
the
contrary
if
the
mind
and
nervous
system
are
excited
by
joyous
and
agreeable
emotions
the
circulation
of

is
quicker
and
the

more
powerfully
resists

when
the

is
partially
inactive

what
is

the

of
the

the
preceding
remark
explains
why
an
individual
who
sleeps
in
the

contracts
a

the

the

of
the
those
persons
that
are
well
clothed
have
greater
power
to
resist
cold
than
the
thinly
apparelled
because
both
the
evaporation
and
the
radiation
from
the

are
impeded
and
less
heat
in
consequence
is
abstracted
from
the
body
if
the
articles
of
apparel
possess
the
property
of
retaining
air
in
their
meshes
as
flannel
the
removal
of

is
not
as
rapid
as
when
linen
is
worn
in
winter
although
more
heat
is
generated
in
the
system
than
in
summer
yet
we
require
more
clothing
and
also
those
articles
that
are
poor
conductors
of
heat
because
caloric
is
more
rapidly
extracted
in
clear
cold
weather
than
in
a
warm
day
what
does
the
preceding
remark
explain
what
suggestion
respecting
the
condition
of
the
skin
before
taking
a
walk
or
ride
in
a
cold
day
why
do
the
amount

of

affect

more
rapid
and

is
generated
than
when
the
opposite
condition
obtains
persons
of
a
feeble
constitution
particularly
if
any
of
the
vital
organs
are
diseased
need
more
clothing
and
require
rooms
of
a
warmer
temperature
than
individuals
who
are
free
from
disease
and
have
a
vigorous
constitution
the
brain
lungs
heart
and
digestive
organs
are
called

persons
who
are
infirm
and
whose
vital
powers
are
feeble
in
general
accustom
themselves
to
an
undue
amount
of
clothing
and
warm
rooms
a
more
judicious
practice
would
be
to
exercise
more
and
use
a
moderate
amount
of
clothing
together
with
a
more
nutritious
diet
surplus
heat
should
be
removed
equally
from
all
parts
of
the
the
rapid
evaporation
of
fluids
as
in
free
perspiration
or
from
radiation
as
in
a
cold
atmosphere
is
attended
with
a
removal
of
heat
from
the
system
this
modifies
the
action
of
the
circulatory
vessels
consequently
if
heat
is
suddenly
and
rapidly
abstracted
from
one
part
of
the
system
the
equilibrium
of
the
circulation
is
destroyed
which
will
produce
disease
why
do
we
then
require
more
clothing
in
winter
than
in
summer
why
do
persons
of
firm
health
and
vigorous
constitutions
need
less
clothing
than
those
who
are
feeble
what
is
a
general
practice
among
infirm
persons
what
would
be
more
judicious
why
should
the
surplus
heat
be
removed
equally
from
all
parts
of
the

what
is
said
respecting
currents
of

from

currents
of

that
impinge
upon
small
portions
of
the
body
as
from

be
avoided
they
are
more
dangerous
than
to
expose
the
whole

to
a
brisk
wind
because
the
current
of

removes
the
heat
from

exposed
which
disturbs
the
circulation
of

and
causes
disease
usually
in
the
form
of
colds
for
the
same
reason
it
is
not
judicious
to
stand

an
open

system

less
when
the

as
in
the

is
gradual
when
not
influenced
by
foreign
causes
this
gradual

is
known
under
the
name
by
this
means
the
body
is
enabled
to
endure
tropical
heat
and
polar
cold
owing
to
this
gradual
adaptation
of
the
system
to
different
temperatures
we
can
bear
a
greater
degree
of
heat
in
the
summer
between
the
tropics
than
in
the
winter
under
the
polar
circles
on
the
other
hand
we
can
endure
a
greater
degree
of
cold
in
winter
and
in
the
arctic
region
than
in
the
summer
and
in
equatorial
countries
the
sensation
of
heat
which
would
be
oppressive
in
a
mild
warm
day
of
january
would
only
be
grateful
in
july
and
a
degree
of
cold
which
could
scarcely
be
endured
in
august
would
not
be
uncomfortable
in
december
the
changes
of
season
in
our
latitude
prevent
the
disagreeable
and
perhaps
fatal
consequence
that
would
follow
if
no
spring
or
autumn
intervened
between
the
severity
of
winter
cold
and
the
intensity
of
summer
heat
during
the
transition
periods
the
constitution
is
gradually
changed
and
adapted
to
bear
the
extremes
of
temperature
without
suffering
the
amount
of

generated
in
the
nutrient
capillary
vessels
is
likewise
diminished

increased
as
the

prevent

hence
arises
the

gymnastic
and
calisthenic
exercises
are
invaluable
aids
to
the
culture
and
development
of
the

and
should
be
sedulously
practised
when
opportunity
renders
them
accessible

even
a

degree
of
physical
exercise
in
any
form
adapted
to
the
expansion
of

to
the
freedom

will
serve
to
impart
energy
and
glow
to
the
muscular
apparatus
of
voice
and
clearness
to
its
sound
there
is
therefore
a
great
advantage
in
always
practising
some
preliminary
muscular
actions
as
an
immediate
preparation
for
vocal
exercises
the
art
of
cultivating
the
voice
however
has
in
addition
to
the
various
forms
of
corporeal
exercise
practised
for
the
general
purpose
of
promoting
health
its
own
specific
prescription

securing
the
vigor
of
the
vocal

modes
of

adapted
to
the
training
of
each
class
of

separately
the
results
of
such
practice
are
of
indefinite
extent
they
are
limited
only
by
the
energy
and
perseverance
of
the
student
excepting
perhaps
in
some
instances
of
imperfect
organization
a
few
weeks
of
diligent
cultivation
are
usually
sufficient
to
produce
such
an
effect
on
the
vocal
organs
that
persons
who
commence
practice
with
a
feeble
and
ineffective
utterance
attain
in
that
short
period
the
full
command
of
clear
forcible
and

at
something
like
an
estimate
of

in

of

i
counted
the
perspiratory

on
the

and
found
in
a
square
inch
now
each
of
these
pores
being
the
aperture
of
a
little
tube
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
long
it
follows
that
in
a
square
inch
of
skin
on
the
palm
of
the

there
exists
a
length
of

equal
to
inches

feet
surely
such
an
amount
of
drainage
as
feet
in
every
square

assuming
this
to
be
the
average
for
the

is
something
wonderful

the

naturally
intrudes
itself
what
if

what
is
said
of

of

physiology
of
the
skin
the
skin
invests
the
whole
of
the
external
surface
of
the
body
following
all
its
prominences
and
curves
and
gives
protection
to
all
the
organs
it
encloses
while
each
of
its
several
parts
has
a
distinct
use
the
cuticle
is
insensible
and
serves
as
a
sheath
of
protection
to
the
highly
sensitive
skin
situated
beneath
it
the
latter
feels
but
the
former
blunts
the
impression
which
occasions
feeling
in
some
situations
the
cuticle
is
so
dense
and
thick
as
wholly
to
exclude
ordinary
impressions
of
this
we
see
an
example
in
the
ends
of
the
fingers
where
the
hard
and
dense
nail
is
the
cuticle
modified
for
the
purpose
referred
to
were
the
nervous
tissue
of
the
true
skin
not
thus
protected
every
sensation
would
be
so
acute
as
to
be
unpleasant
and
contact
with
external
bodies
would
cause
pain
the
cuticle
also
prevents
disease
by
impeding
the
evaporation
of
the
fluids
of
the
true
skin
and
the
absorption
of
the
poisonous
vapors
which
necessarily
attend
various
employments
it
however
affords
protection
to
the
system
only
when
unbroken
and
then
to
the
greatest
degree
when
covered
with
a
proper
amount
of
oily

originally
a
transparent
fluid
exuded

distributed
as
a
thin
layer
on
the
surface
of
the
true
skin
while
successive
layers
are
formed
on
the
exterior
of
the
true
skin
the
external
cuticular
layers
are
converted
into
dry
flattened
scales
by
the
evaporation
of
their
fluid
contents
the
thickness
of
the

is
formed
mainly
from
these
scales

mention
another
use
of
the

what
is
the

originally
the
cuticle
is
therefore
undergoing
a
constant
process
of
formation
and
growth
at
its
under
part
to
compensate
for
the
wear
that
is
taking
place
continually
on
its
surface
a
proper
thickness
of
the
cuticle
is
in
this
manner
preserved
the
faculty
of

and
that
of

are
properly
regulated
the
places
of
the
little
scales
which
are
continually
falling
off
under
the
united
influence
of
friction
and
ablution
are
supplied
and
an
action
necessary
not
merely
to
the
health
of
the
skin
but
to
that
of
the
entire
body
is
established
whenever
the
cuticle
is
exposed
to
moderate
and
repeated
friction
it
becomes
thicker
and
tougher
as
may
be
seen
in
the
cuticle
of
the
lady
finger
that
plies
the
needle
and
in
the
hard

benefit
derived
from

thus
changed
what
is
the
result
if
the
joints
of
the
feet
are
subjected
to
moderate
and
continued
pressure
what
is
the
form
of
a

to
remove
these
painful
excrescences
take
a
thick
piece
of
soft
leather
somewhat
larger
than
the

in
the

punch
a
hole
of
the
size
of
the
summit
of
the

spread
the
leather
with
adhesive
plaster
and
apply
it
around
the

remove
it
and
wash
with
warm

repeat
this
for
several
successive
nights
and
the
corn
will
be
removed
the
only
precaution
is
not
to
repeat
the

so
as
to
cause

let
a
person
unaccustomed

labor
trundle
the

for
several
successive

and
the

water
thrown

been
thrown
out
to
form
new

upon
the

the
cuticle
is
interesting
to
us
in
another
point
of
view
as
being
the
seat
of
the
color
of
the

the
difference
of
color
between
the
blonde

the
european

lies
in
the
cuticle
in
the
deeper

layers
of
that
structure
in
the
whitest
skin
the

of
the

contain
more
or
less
of
a
peculiar
pigment
incorporated
with
the
elementary
granules
which
enter
into
their

in
the
white

is
extremely
slight
and
less
in

than
in

in
the
darker

on
the
contrary
it
is
deep
and
strongly

how
can
they
be

what
precaution
is

explain
why
those
persons
unaccustomed
to

blister
their

in
rowing
a

performing
ordinary
manual
employment
for
several
successive

in
what
other
point
of

is
the

interesting
in
what
part
of
it
do
we
find
the

the
various
tints
of

exhibited
by
mankind
are
therefore
referable
to
the
amount
of

principle
contained
within
the
elementary

thus
in

most
powerful
the

is
stimulated
by
these

to
vigorous

is
very
deep
while
in
the
temperate

where
light

not
so
intense
the
lungs

relieve
the

of
part
of
its

the

of
the

has
been
called
the
mucous
coat
of

and
described
as
a
distinct

by
many
physiologists
the
various
coloring
of
the

gives
to
some
animals
their
varied
hues
the
serpent
the
frog
the
lizard
and
some
fishes
have
a
splendor
of
hue
almost
equal
to

the

the
dolphin
owe
their
difference
of
color
and
the
brilliancy
of
their
hues
to
the

of
this

the
nerves
of

are
the
organs
of
the

a

who
had
been
afflicted
some
years
with
a
severe
disease
of
a
portion
of

was
deprived
of

he
was
directed
by
his
attending
physician
to
use
a
warm
footbath
intending
to
follow
the
directions
given
him
he
immersed
his
feet
in
boiling
water
which
he
supposed
of
a
proper
temperature
while
his
feet
were
immersed
in
the
water
he
experienced
no
sensation
of
an
unpleasant
nature
on
withdrawing
them
he
was
astonished
to
find
the
cuticle
separated
from
the
other
tissues
by
the
effusion
of
serum
and
thus
producing
a
blister
over
the
whole

suffer
every

were
it
not
for
the
care
exercised
by

by
which
all

are
transmitted
to
the

as
the

is
continually
exposed
to
the
influence
of
destructive
agents
it
is
important
that
the

provided
for
its
protection
should
be
kept
in
a
healthy
state
a
large
proportion
of
the

take

attention
should
be

to
and
clothing
in
itself
does
not

is
chiefly
useful
in
preventing

from

and
in
defending
it
from
the
temperature
of
the

in
selecting
and
applying
clothing
to
our
persons
the
following
suggestions
should
be
observed
material
for
clothing
should
be
a
bad
conductor
of
that
is
it
should
have
little
tendency
to
conduct
or
remove
heat
from
the
body
this
depends
mainly
on
the
property
possessed
by
the
material
in
retaining
atmospheric
air
in
its
meshes
material
for
clothing
should
not
possess
the
property
of
absorbing
and
retaining
dampness
or
moisture
renders
apparel
a
good
conductor
of
heat
beside
if
the
perspired
fluid
and
the
saline
material
it
holds
in
solution
are
readily
absorbed
by
the
clothing
they
become
sources
of
irritation
to
the
skin
with
which
the
apparel
comes
in
contact
give
the
hygiene
of
the
skin
what
influences
modify
the
action
of
the
oil
and
perspiratory
glands
to
what
must
attention
be
given
to
maintain
a
healthy
action
of
the
skin
what
is
said
in
regard
to
the
clothing
mention
a
property
that
the
material
for
clothing
should
possess
what
property
in
the
selection
of
clothing
should
we
avoid
why
contain
a
greater
amount
of
air
in
their
meshes
than
any
other
article
and
they
absorb
no
moisture
consequently
as
an
article
of
dress
they
are
best
adapted
to
those
who
are
exposed
to
great
vicissitudes
of
heat
and
cold
retains
more
air
in
its
meshes
than
any
other
article
except
furs
and
eider
down
and
it
absorbs
but
very
little
moisture
these
properties
together
with
its
comparative
cheapness
render
it
a
good
article
of
apparel
for
all
classes
of
persons
the
only
objection
to
its
general
use
is
the
disturbance
of
the
electricity
of
the
system
and
the
irritation
to
delicate
skins
from
the
roughness
of
its
fibres
flannels
are
not
only
beneficial
during
the
cold
season
in
preventing
colds
and
rheumatism
but
they
are
of
great
utility
in
the
warm
season
in
shielding
the
system
from
the
chills
at
evening
that
induce
disease
of
the
alimentary
canal
their
general
use
among
children
and
delicate
females
would
be
a
preventive
of
the
season
complaints
prevalent
in
the
months
of
august
and
september
contains
less
air
in
its
meshes
than
woollen
but
much
more
than
linen
in
texture
it
is
smoother
than
wool
and
less
liable
to
irritate
the
skin
this
fabric
absorbs
moisture
in
a
small
degree
in
all
respects
it
is
well
adapted
for
garments
worn
next
the
skin
when
woollen
flannels
irritate
the
skin
they
may
be
lined
with
cotton
is
not
as
good
a
conductor
of
heat
as
cotton
nor
does
it
absorb
moisture
to
any
considerable
degree
its
texture
is
smooth
and
does
not
irritate
the
skin
consequently
when
the
garment
of
this
fabric
has
sufficient
body
or
thickness
it
is
a
good
article
for
clothing
the
greatest
objection
to
its
use
is
the
disturbance
of
the
electricity
of
the
system
and
its
high
price
give
the
properties
of
fur
as
an
article
of
dress
to
whom
are
they
best
adapted
give
the
properties
of
woollen
cloth
is
this
a
good
article
for
clothing
what
objection
what
are
the
advantages
of
wearing
flannels
what
are
the
qualities
of
cotton
as
an
article
of
dress
of
silk
is
not
only
a
good
conductor
of
heat
and
consequently
a
poor
article
of
apparel
but
it
likewise
absorbs
the
fluids
carried
from
the
system
by
the
agency
of
the
oil
and
perspiratory
glands
when
garments
are
made
of
this
material
the
body
is
not
surrounded
by
a
layer
of
air
but
by
one
of
moisture
this
still
further
increases
its
power
to
conduct
heat
from
the
system
rendering
it
a
very
objectionable
article
of
apparel
even
in
warm
weather
and
in
hot
climates
where
the
dress
is
usually
thin
differs
in
its
power
of
radiating
this
is
influenced
by
the
color
those
articles
that
radiate
heat
freely
also
absorb
it
readily
a
black
surface
is
a
good
radiator
while
a
white
surface
is
not
because
it
reflects
the
calorific
rays
it
is
obvious
that
those
colors
which
render
the
transmission
of
external
heat
difficult
must
impede
the
transmission
of
caloric
from
the
body
thus
it
is
manifest
that
apparel
is
best
adapted
for
every
season
and
every
climate
are
practically
aware
that
in
cold
weather
are
warmest
except
when
they
are
exposed
to
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
or
when
seated
before
a
warm
fire
on
the
other
hand
when
the
temperature
is
elevated
apparel
is
coolest
because
the
sun
rays
are
then
reflected
clothing
should
be
of
a
porous
the
skin
is
not
only
an
important
agent
in
separating
from
the
blood
those
impurities
that
otherwise
would
oppress
the
system
and
occasion
death
but
it
exercises
great
influence
upon
the
system
by
receiving
oxygen
through
its
tissues
and
giving
back
carbonic
acid
in
return
consequently
the
apparel
should
be
made
of
a
material
that
will
permit
free
transpiration
from
the
skin
and
likewise
convey
the
excreted
fluids
from
the
surface
what
is
said
of
linen
as
an
article
of
apparel
why
is
apparel
best
adapted
for
every
season
what
is
said
of
the
apparel
of
why
should
we
wear
porous
clothing
the
necessity
for
this
is
illustrated
in
wearing
india
rubber
if
they
are
worn
over
boots
ten
or
twelve
hours
not
only
the
hose
but
the
boots
will
be
moist
from
retained
perspiration
and
the
residual
matter
left
in
contact
with
the
skin
may
be
reconveyed
into
the
system
by
absorption
causing
headache
and
other
diseases
cotton
and
woollen
fabrics
are
not
only
bad
conductors
of
heat
but
are
also
porous
for
these
reasons
they
are
well
adapted
to
transmit
the
excretions
of
the
skin
clothing
should
be
not
only
porous
but
fitted
the
garments
should
retain
a
layer
of
air
between
them
and
the
body
every
one
is
practically
aware
that
a
loose
dress
is
much
warmer
than
one
which
fits
closely
that
a
loose
glove
is
warmer
than
a
tight
one
and
that
a
loose
boot
or
shoe
affords
greater
warmth
than
one
of
smaller
dimensions
the
explanation
is
obvious
the
loose
dress
encloses
a
thin
layer
of
air
which
the
tight
dress
is
incapable
of
doing
and
what
is
required
is
that
the
dress
should
be
closed
at
the
upper
part
to
prevent
the
dispersion
of
the
warm
air
by
the
ventilating
current
which
would
be
established
from
below
as
the
purpose
of
additional
garments
is
to
maintain
a
series
of
strata
of
warm
air
within
our
clothing
we
should
in
going
from
a
warm
room
into
the
cold
air
put
on
our
defensive
coverings
some
little
time
previous
in
order
that
the
layers
of
air
which
we
carry
with
us
may
be
sufficiently
warmed
by
the
heat
of
the
room
and
not
borrowed
from
the
body
on
exposure
to
the
cold
how
is
the
necessity
of
porous
clothing
illustrated
why
should
we
wear
loose
garments
what
is
the
use
of
additional
garments
when
going
from
a
warm
to
a
cold
air
when
should
they
be
put
on
clothing
should
be
suited
to
the
temperature
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
condition
of
the
the
invariable
rule
should
be
to
wear
enough
to
maintain
an
equal
and
healthy
action
of
the
skin
care
should
be
taken
however
that
the
action
of
the
cutaneous
vessels
is
not
inordinately
increased
as
this
would
debilitate
not
only
the
skin
but
the
internal
organs
of
the
system
as
the
stomach
and
lungs
no
rule
as
to
the
quantity
of
clothing
can
be
given
as
the
demand
will
vary
with
different
individuals
the
following
are
among
the
most
prominent
causes
of
this
variation
those
persons
who
have
large
active
brains
full
chests
well
developed
lungs
breathe
an
adequate
amount
of
pure
air
and
take
sufficient
food
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
system
require
less
clothing
than
those
of
an
opposite
character
because
more
heat
is
generated
in
the
system
child
and
the
aged
person
require
more
clothing
than
the
vigorous
should
we
judge
from
observation
the
inference
would
be
that
children
require
less
clothing
than
adults
this
is
an
error
for
the
temperature
in
infancy
is
not
only
lower
than
in
manhood
but
the
power
of
creating
heat
is
feebler
the
same
remarks
are
applicable
to
those
persons
who
have
outlived
the
energies
of
adult
life
the
system
of
hardening
children
by
an
inadequate
supply
of
clothing
and
keeping
them
uncomfortably
cold
throughout
the
whole
day
is
inhuman
as
well
as
unprofitable
it
operates
upon
the
child
somewhat
like
the
chill
upon
a
certain
portion
of
the
farmer
herd
that
are
kept
shivering
under
the
thatched
shed
retarding
the
growth
of
their
systems
which
require
more
food
to
satisfy
the
keen
cravings
of
hunger
than
when
they
are
comfortably
sheltered
to
make
the
boy
robust
and
active
he
must
have
nutritious
food
at
stated
hours
and
free
exercise
in
the
open
air
and
his
system
must
be
guarded
from
chills
by
a
due
amount
of
apparel
what
should
be
the
invariable
rule
in
reference
to
the
amount
of
clothing
that
should
be
worn
what
precaution
should
be
observed
what
are
some
of
the
causes
of
the
variation
of
the
demand
for
clothing
why
do
the
child
and
aged
person
require
more
clothing
than
the
vigorous
adult
what
is
said
of
the
system
of
hardening
children
clothing
is
needed
when
a
vital
organ
is
it
may
be
observed
that
in
consumption
dyspepsia
and
even
in
headache
the
skin
is
pale
and
the
extremities
cold
because
less
heat
is
generated
thus
persons
affected
with
these
complaints
when
exposed
to
cold
air
need
more
clothing
than
those
individuals
whose
organs
are
not
diseased
and
the
functions
of
which
are
properly
performed
clothing
is
required
in
the
evening
than
during
the
in
the
evening
we
have
less
vital
energy
and
therefore
less
heat
is
generated
in
the
system
than
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
beside
the
atmosphere
is
damp
the
skin
has
become
moist
from
free
perspiration
and
heat
in
consequence
is
rapidly
removed
from
the
system
for
this
reason
when
returning
from
crowded
assemblies
we
should
be
provided
with
an
extra
garment
if
there
is
a
chill
upon
the
system
after
having
arrived
home
warmth
should
be
restored
as
speedily
as
possible
this
can
be
done
by
friction
with
warm
flannels
and
by
using
the
warm
or
vapor
bath
by
this
procedure
the
pernicious
effects
of
the
chill
will
be
prevented
before
any
disease
is
fixed
upon
the
system
is
it
not
the
duty
of
the
parent
and
the
guardian
to
learn
these
facts
and
to
see
that
they
are
not
only
learned
but
reduced
to
practice
the
farmer
and
industrious
mechanic
would
be
freed
from
many
a
rheumatic
pain
if
while
resting
from
their
labors
at
evening
or
taking
the
ordinary
meal
after
hard
toil
they
would
put
on
an
extra
garment
the
coat
might
not
feel
so
agreeable
for
the
first
few
minutes
but
it
would
ultimately
conduce
to
health
and
longevity
why
do
dyspeptic
and
consumptive
persons
require
more
clothing
than
those
who
have
healthy
vital
organs
why
do
we
need
more
clothing
in
the
evening
than
during
the
day
how
can
the
pernicious
effects
of
a
chill
be
prevented
give
the
observation
person
of
active
habits
requires
less
clothing
than
one
of
sedentary
exercise
increases
the
circulation
of
the
blood
which
is
always
attended
by
the
disengagement
of
a
greater
quantity
of
heat
consequently
an
increase
of
warmth
is
felt
throughout
the
system
we
likewise
need
more
clothing
while
riding
than
when
we
are
walking
because
the
exercise
of
the
former
is
less
than
that
of
the
latter
the
same
is
true
when
resting
in
the
field
or
shop
after
laborious
exercise
we
need
a
greater
amount
of
clothing
while
asleep
than
during
the
day
as
not
only
the
action
of
the
body
but
that
of
the
brain
during
sleep
is
suspended
clothing
is
required
when
the
cutaneous
surface
is
a
film
of
impurities
obstructs
the
perspiratory
ducts
and
diminishes
the
action
of
their
glands
consequently
less
heat
is
generated
for
this
reason
the
hands
or
feet
when
clean
are
less
liable
to
become
chilled
or
frozen
sensitiveness
of
the
skin
to
the
influence
of
cold
is
much
modified
by
a
person
who
has
been
habituated
to
the
temperature
of
a
warm
room
or
warm
climate
suffers
more
when
exposed
to
cold
than
an
individual
who
has
been
accustomed
to
colder
air
thus
a
person
who
labors
or
studies
in
a
warm
room
should
wear
more
clothing
when
exposed
to
the
air
while
walking
or
riding
than
an
individual
who
labors
in
a
cooler
atmosphere
not
only
is
the
sensibility
of
the
skin
increased
by
a
warm
atmosphere
but
the
activity
of
the
digestive
respiratory
and
nervous
systems
in
generating
heat
is
much
diminished
this
is
an
additional
reason
why
an
increased
amount
of
clothing
is
demanded
during
exposure
to
cold
air
in
all
cases
where
practicable
the
heat
of
the
system
should
be
maintained
by
exercise
in
preference
to
the
use
of
fur
or
flannel
why
does
the
person
of
active
habits
require
less
clothing
than
one
of
sedentary
employments
why
do
we
need
less
clothing
when
the

is
clean
show
the
effect
of
habit
on
the
sensitiveness
of
the
skin
parts
of
the
skin
usually
covered
uniformly
need
that
the
power
of
generating
heat
is
diminished
and
the
impressibility
to
cold
is
increased
on
those
portions
of
the
skin
usually
clothed
if
a
person
wears
the
dress
high
and
close
about
the
neck
he
suffers
from
exposure
to
a
cold
atmosphere
if
a
dress
is
worn
that
is
not
as
high
or
more
open
as
a
general
rule
it
is
preferable
that
those
parts
of
the
system
as
the
larynx
be
exposed
that
are
not
uniformly
protected
by
clothing
clothing
should
be
kept
no
article
of
apparel
is
entirely
free
from
absorption
even
wool
and
cotton
possess
it
in
a
small
degree
they
take
up
a
portion
of
the
transpired
fluids
which
contain
saline
and
animal
matter
and
thus
the
fibres
of
the
garments
become
covered
with
the
cutaneous
excretions
we
are
practically
aware
of
the
retention
of
these
secretions
from
the
soiled
appearance
of
those
garments
worn
next
the
skin
which
are
so
covered
as
to
preclude
the
particles
of
dust
from
lodging
upon
them
the
porosity
of
the
clothing
is
lessened
when
soiled
and
its
power
of
conducting
heat
from
the
system
in
consequence
is
increased
the
residual
matter
with
which
the
clothing
is
coated
is
brought
in
contact
with
the
skin
which
causes
irritation
and
not
unfrequently
of
the
elements
thrown
off
from
the
system
through
this
avenue
hence
warmth
cleanliness
and
health
require
that
the
clothing
particularly
the
garments
worn
next
to
the
skin
should
be
frequently
and
thoroughly
washed
this
should
not
be
forgotten
in
regard
to
children
for
their
blood
circulates
with
greater
rapidity
than
that
of
adults
and
a
proportionably
greater
amount
of
waste
matter
is
thrown
off
from
their
systems
worn
during
the
day
should
not
be
worn
at
night
or
the
when
are
worn
several
successive
days
or
nights
they
should
not
be
put
in
drawers
or
hung
up
in
a
close
closet
as
soon
as
taken
from
the
body
but
should
be
exposed
to
a
current
of
air
beds
should
be
thoroughly
aired
in
the
the
excretions
from
the
skin
are
most
abundant
during
the
hours
of
sleep
and
if
the
sheets
and
blankets
together
with
the
bed
are
not
aired
every
morning
by
being
so
arranged
that
both
surfaces
may
be
exposed
to
the
air
the
materials
eliminated
from
the
skin
will
be
retained
in
the
meshes
of
the
and
may
be
conveyed
into
the
system
of
the
next
occupant
by
absorption
oftentimes
diseases
of
a
disagreeable
nature
are
contracted
in
this
way
this
fact
should
be
instilled
into
every
mother
and
daughter
mind
should
not
be
put
on
a
bed
when
it
is
not
sufficiently
dried

the

many
a
young

has
laid
the
foundation
of
a
fatal
disease
by
disregarding
this
rule
in
exchanging
the
thick
dress
with
woollen
stockings
for
the
flimsy
dress
and
hose
of
silk
or
cotton
which
are
considered
suitable
for
the
or
party
sudden
changes
in
as
well
as
in
food
and
general
habits
are
attended
with
hazard
and
this
is
proportionate
to
the
weakness
or
exhaustion
of
the
system
when
the
change
is
made
should
the
garments
worn
during
the
day
be
worn
at
night
what
is
said
respecting
the
cleanliness
of

why
should

why
the

then
be
rubbed
with
a
dry
crash
towel
until
reaction
indicated
by
redness
is
produced
if
the
garments
are
not

the
person
should
exercise
moderately
so
that

may
continue

in
the

to
dry
the
clothing
and
skin
without
a
chill
sitting
in
a
cool
shade
or
current
of
air
should
by
all
means
be
avoided
as
colds
are
not
contracted
by
free
and
excessive
exercise
but
by
injudicious
management
after
such
exercise
when
an
individual
has
been
thrown
into
a
profuse
perspiration
by
violent
exercise
though
the
skin
and
clothing
may
become
wet
he
feels
no
inconvenience
from
the
dampness
as
long
as
he
continues
that
amount
of
exercise
for
the
reason
that
the
circulation
of

increased
heat
is
generated
in
sufficient
quantity
to
replace
the

abstracted
from

in
evaporating

but
as
soon
as
the
exercise
is
discontinued
the
increased
circulation
subsides
and
with
it
the
extra
amount
of

heat
this
accounts
for
the

chapter
xxxiv
hygiene
of
the
skin
continued
bathing
its
necessity
and
expediency
is
obvious
from
the
structure
and
the
functions
of
the
skin
the
cuticle
is
cast
off
in
minute
powdery
scales
many
of
which
are
retained
upon
the
surface
by
the
pressure
of
clothing
these
mingle
with
the
oily
and
saline
products
of
the
skin
and
form
a
thin
crust
this
crust
on
account
of
its
adhesiveness
collects
particles
of
dust
and
soot
from
the
atmosphere
and
particles
of
foreign
matter
from
our
dress
so
that
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
whole
body
becomes
coated
with
impurities
if
this
coating
remains
becomes
thick
and
established
upon
the
skin
it
will
produce
the
following
effects
pores
will
be
obstructed
consequently
transpiration
impeded
and
the
influence
of
the
skin
as
an
excretory
entirely
when
the
pores
are
obstructed
and
transpiration
is
checked
the
elements
of
the
transpired
fluids
will
necessarily
be
retained
in
the
system
and
as
they
are
injurious
and
poisonous
if
retained
they
must
be
removed
by
those
organs
whose
functions
in
the
animal
economy
are
similar
as
the
lungs
kidneys
liver
intestines
when
these
organs
are
called
upon
to
perform
their
offices
and
in
addition
that
of
another
the
healthy
equilibrium
is
destroyed
and
the
oppressed
organ
will
suffer
from
exhaustion
and
become
the
prey
of
disease
thus
obviously
habits
of
uncleanliness
are
a
cause
of
consumption
and
other
serious
diseases
of
the
vital
organs
again
obstruction
of
the
pores
will
prevent
respiration
through
the
skin
thus
depriving
the
blood
of
one
source
of
its
oxygen
and
one
outlet
of
its
carbonic
acid
which
will
diminish
the
temperature
of
the
system
and
the
same
results
follow
as
when
the
clothing
is
inadequate
show
the
necessity
for
bathing
what
effect
upon
the
body
if
the
pores
of
the
skin
are
obstructed
what
is
the
effect
when
an
organ
not
only
performs
its
own
specific
function
but
that
of
another
retained
perspirable
matter
will
irritate
the
skin
both
mechanically
and
and
this
membrane
will
be
kept
damp
and
cold
from
attraction
and
detention
of
moisture
and
foreign
material
as
before
adverted
to
once
removed
from
the
system
may
be
reconveyed
into
it
by
absorption
as
a
consequence
cutaneous
eruptions
and
diseases
will
be
produced
and
the
of
matter
once
separated
from
the
system
will
be
the
exciting
cause
of
other
injurious
disorders
film
of
foreign
substance
on
the
skin
will
inevitably
become
the
seat
of
detention
of
miasmata
and
infectious
these
will
remain
until
absorbed
and
engender
the
diseases
of
which
they
are
the
peculiar
cause
this
is
one
reason
why
filthy
persons
contract
infectious
diseases
more
frequently
than
individuals
of
cleanly
habits
is
useful
to
promote
in
this
capacity
it
enables
us
to
remove
the
coating
of
impurities
from
the
exterior
of
our
persons
it
effects
this
purpose
by
dissolving
saline
matters
and
holding
in
temporary
suspension
those
substances
which
are
insoluble
the
cuticle
is
composed
of
a
substance
resembling
the
dried
white
of
egg
or
in
a
word
this
is
soluble
in
alkalies
and
these
are
the
agents
which
are
commonly
employed
for
purifying
the
skin
soap
is
a
compound
of
the
alkali
soda
with
oil
the
former
being
in
excess
when
used
for
washing
the
excess
of
alkali
combining
with
the
oily
fluid
with
which
the
skin
is
naturally
bedewed
removes
it
in
the
form
of
an
emulsion
and
with
it
a
portion
of
any
adhering
matter
another
portion
of
the
alkali
softens
and
dissolves
the
superficial
layer
of
the
cuticle
and
when
this
is
removed
the
cuticle
is
free
from
impurities
how
are
cutaneous
eruptions
frequently
produced
how
are
infectious
vapors
transmitted
to
the
system
how
does
bathing
promote
cleanliness
why
is
it
necessary
to
use
soap
in
bathing
every
washing
of
the
skin
with
soap
removes
the
old
face
of
the
cuticle
and
leaves
a
new
one
and
were
the
process
repeated
to
excess
the
latter
would
become
so
thin
as
to
render
the
body
sensible
to
impressions
too
slight
to
be
felt
through
its
ordinary
thickness
on
the
other
hand
when
the
cuticle
and
its
accumulated
impurities
are
rarely
disturbed
the
sensitiveness
of
the
skin
is
impaired
the
proper
inference
to
be
drawn
from
the
preceding
remarks
is
in
favor
of
the
use
of
soap
to
cleanse
the
skin
if
any
unpleasant
sensations
are
felt
after
the
use
of
soap
they
may
be
immediately
removed
by
washing
the
surface
with
water
slightly
acidulated
with
lemon
juice
or
vinegar
which
neutralizes
the
alkali
that
may
remain
on
the
skin
this
is
effective
treatment
for
chapped
hands
may
be
partial
or
general
and
the
water
used
may
be
cold
temperate
tepid
warm
or
a
person
may
apply
it
to
his
system
with
a
sponge
it
may
be
poured
upon
him
or
he
may
immerse
himself
in
it
the
simplest
mode
of
bathing
is
to
apply
water
to
a
small
extent
of
surface
by
means
of
a
wet
sponge
and
after
being
wiped
dry
again
cover
with
the
dress
in
this
way
the
whole
body
may
be
speedily
subjected
to
the
influence
of
water
and
to
no
less
useful
friction
the
water
used
may
be
warm
or
cold
this
species
of
bathing
may
be
practised
by
any
invalid
and
always
with
benefit
if
the
bathing
is
succeeded
by
a
glow
of
warmth
over
the
surface
and
this
is
the
test
by
which
the
benefit
of
all
forms
of
bathing
is
to
be
estimated
why
should
only
a
moderate
amount
of
soap
be
used
in
bathing
if
unpleasant
sensations
are
felt
from
too
free
use
of
soap
how
can
they
be
counteracted
give
the
different
forms
of

what
is
the
simplest
mode
of
bathing
can
this
mode
be
adopted
by
invalids
with
safety
when
the
heat
of
the
system
is
adequate
the
bather
may
stand
or
sit
in
a
shallow
tub
while
he
receives
the
water
from
a
sponge
squeezed
over
the
shoulders
or
against
the
body
in
this
form
of
bathing
the
person
is
more
exposed
to
the
cold
air
and
on
this
account
it
is
less
suitable
for
very
feeble
individuals
than
the
method
in
the
early
use
of
this
form
of
the
the
bather
should
content
himself
with
a
single
affusion
from
the
sponge
the
body
should
be
quickly
wiped
with
a
soft
towel
and
friction
applied
with
a
crash
towel
or
a
brush
the
third
kind
of
bathing
is
that
of
the
which
provides
a
greater
amount
of
affusion
than

former
combined
with
a
greater
shock
to

nervous
system
the
concussion
of
the
skin
by
the
fall
of
water
particularly
distinguishes
this
from
the
previous
modes
of

the
degree
of

openings
through
which

water
issues

it
must
not
precede

the

should
be
bathed
at

every

day
but
the
most
perfect
health
of

would
be
maintained
if
the
excretions
from
the

bathing
is
a
remedial
measure
of
great
power
it
should
never
be
neglected
or
omitted
it
is
not
only
pleasant
and
safe
but
is
really
more
effective
than
any
medicine
administered
internally
this
like
other
curative
means
should
be
applied
by
the
direction
and
under
the
eye
of
the
medical
adviser
that
it
may
be
adapted

the
condition
of

of
man
existence

were
dedicated
by

to
the
divinities
of

strength
and
wisdom
namely
æsculapius
hercules
and

to
whom
might

the
air
is
an
agent
of
importance
in
the
functions
of
the
skin
it
imparts
to
this
membrane
oxygen
and
receives
from
it
carbonic
acid
it
likewise
removes
from
it
a
large
portion
of
the
perspiration
and
the
more
fluid
portions
of
the
oily
secretion
in
order
that
the
air
may
accomplish
these
ends
it
is
necessary
that
it
come
in
contact
with
the
body
this
is
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
we
should
wear
loose
and
porous
clothing
again
the
air
should
be
pure
and
free
from
redundant
moisture
in
the
warm
mornings
of
july
and
august
the
air
is
loaded
with
moisture
and
impurities
and
the
perspirable
matter
is
not
removed
from
the
system
as
it
is
when
the
air
is
pure
and
dry
this
is
the
cause
of
the
general
lassitude
that
is
experienced
during
such
mornings
as
soon
as
the

is
dispelled
these
unpleasant
sensations
are
removed
to
sustain
the
functions
of
the

in
a
healthy
state

will
be
purer

color
of

if
the

is
surrounded
by
fresh
and
pure
air
than
when
it
is

the
light
permeating
the

not
only
exercises
a
salutary
influence
upon
this
membrane
but
upon
the

and
through
this
fluid
upon
the
whole
system
for
this
reason
the
kitchen

the

should
be
selected
from
the
most
pleasant

dark

body

the
dark
damp
rooms
so
much
used
in
cities

by
indigent
families

are
fruitful
causes
of

the
nail
upon
its
under
surface
is
fashioned
into
thin
vertical
plates
which
are
received
between
the
folds
of
the
sensitive
skin
in
this
manner
the
two
kinds
of
laminæ
reciprocally
embrace
each
other
and
the
firmness
of
connection
of
the
nail
is
maintained
if
we
look
on
the
surface
of
the
nail
we
see
an
indication
of
this
structure
in
the
alternate
red
and
white
lines
which
are
there
observed
the
former
of
these
correspond
with
the
sensitive
laminæ
the
latter
with
the
horny
plates
the
ribbed
appearance
of
the
nail
is
due
to
the
same
circumstance
these
sensitive
laminæ
are
provided
with
an
unusual
number
of
capillary
vessels
for
the
formation
of
the
nail
and
hence
they
give
a
red
tint
to
the
portion
under
which
they
lie
near
the
root
of
the
nail
there
is
a
part
that
is
not
laminated
and
it
is
less
abundantly
supplied
with
this
portion
consequently
looks
pale
compared
with
the
laminated
portion
and
from
its
shape
is
technically
termed
beyond
the
lunula
the
root
of
the
nail
is
imbedded
in
the
fold
of
the
sensitive
skin
and
has
the
same
relation
to
that
structure
that
any
single
one
of
the
thin
horny
plates
of
its
under
surface
has
to
its
corresponding
pair
of
sensitive
laminæ
the
nails
from
their
position
are
continually
receiving
knocks
which
produce
a
momentary
disturbance
of
their
cell
formation
followed
by
a
white
spot
the
care
of
the
nails
should
be
strictly
limited
to
the
knife
or
scissors
to
their
free
border
and
an
ivory
presser
to
prevent
adhesion
of
the
free
margin
of
the

this
edge
of

should
never

surface
of

never
scraped
nor
the
nails
cleaned
with
any
instrument
whatever
except
the
aided

an
observance
of
these
suggestions
will
prevent

observation
how
should
the
nails
be
treated
to
prevent
irregularities
and
disease
when
we
wear
a
shoe
that
is
too
short
for
the
foot
the
edge
of
the
nail
is
brought
against
the
leather
this
interrupts
the
forward
growth
of
the
nail
and
it
spreads
out
on
the
sides
and
becomes
unusually
thick
it
then
presses
upon
the
soft
parts
and
is
said
to
grow
into
the
flesh
the
prevention
is
to
wear
shoes
of
ample
size
instances
are
by
no
means
unfrequent
in
which
the
power
of
production
of
the
nail
at
the
root
becomes
entirely
destroyed
and
it
then
grows
in
thickness
only
when
this
affection
occurs
it
is
often
remarkable
what
a
mass
the
nail
presents
instances
are
on
record
where
the
nail
is
regularly
shed
and
whenever
the
old
nail
falls
off
a
new
one
is
found
beneath
it
perfectly
formed
sometimes
the
growth
in
length
is
not
entirely
checked
although
growth
in
thickness
is
induced
the
nail
then
presents
a
peculiar
appearance

the
nervous
system
in
the
preceding
chapters
we
have
seen
how
various
and
complex
are
many
of
the
motions
necessary
to
maintain
the
life
of
an
animal
whose
organization
is
superior
to
all
others
we
have
noted
the
wonderful
mechanism
of
the
muscular
system
in
producing
the
varied
movements
of
the
body
the
different
processes
by
which
the
food
is
converted
into
chyle
and
mixed
with
the
blood
and
the
circulation
of
this
fluid
to
every
organ
and
tissue
of
the
system
that
each
may
select
from
it
the
very
principles
which
it
requires
for
its
growth
lymphatic
absorption
commences
as
soon
as
nutrition
is
completed
and
conveys
the
useless
particles
of
different
tissues
back
into
the
circulating
fluid
while
the
respiratory
organs
and
secretory
glands
perform
the
work
of
preparing
the
waste
products
to
be
eliminated
from
the
body
each
of
these
processes
effects
a
single
object
and
is
performed
in
a
regular
manner
they
must
succeed
each
other
in
proper
order
in
propelling
every
particle
to
its
proper
destination
or
life
would
be
sacrificed
almost
at
the
moment
of
its
commencement
there
is
therefore
a
mutual
dependence
of
all
portions
of
the
machinery
of
organic
life
upon
each
other
and
a
necessity
for
some
medium
of
communication
from
one
organ
to
another
by
which
they
may
convey
mutual
information
of
their
several
conditions
if
we
may
be
permitted
to
employ
a
figurative
expression
were
there
no
such
medium
how
would
the
stomach
notify
the
heart
that
additional
exertion
on
its
part
is
required
because
the
stomach
is
busy
in
digesting
food
what
has
been
noted
in
the
preceding
chapters
show
the
manner
in
which
the
several
processes
are
performed
how
must
they
succeed
each
other
when
we
are
exerting
the
muscular
system
for
a
long
time
in
some
laborious
employment
how
else
are
our
members
to
inform
the
stomach
that
they
are
too
much
occupied
with
their
duties
to
spare
the
blood
necessary
in
digestion
that
it
is
requisite
that
the
appetite
should
decline
and
that
digestion
should
cease
for
the
time
even
if
the
stomach
should
be
oppressed
with
its
contents
when
we
are
thinking
how
else
are
the
to
be
told
that
an
unusual
supply
of
their
contents
is
wanting
in
the
head
or
when
the
whole
frame
is
weary
with
exertion
how
without
some
regular
line
of
intelligence
between
all
the
organs
is
the
brain
to
be
instructed
that
circumstances
require
that
it
should

this
results
from

it

from
this
that
if
the

side
of

receives
an
injury
the
parts
of
the
opposite
side
of
the

lose
their

root

only
the

distributed
is
lost
thus
if

nerve
is

the
sense
of
vision
disappears

are
designed

can
only
be
known
by
ascertaining
the
place
of
their
origin
the

may
be
functionally
divided
into
five
groups
of
special
these
are
the
first
second
eighth
and
it
may
be
one
of
the
branches
of
the
fifth
pair
of
cranial
nerves
the
function
of
these
nerves
is
particularly
described
in
the
chapters
upon
the
senses
of
smell
vision
hearing
and
taste
of
general
these
embrace
the
fifth
pair
of
cranial
nerves
and
the
pairs
of
spinal
nerves
in
those
parts
that
require
sensation
for
their
safety
and
the
performance
of
their
functions
there
is
an
abundant
supply
of
sensitive
nervous
filaments
the
nerves
of
sensation
are
mostly
distributed
upon
the
skin
few
filaments
ramify
upon
the
mucous
membranes
and
muscles
the
painful
sensations
experienced
in
the
face
and
in
the
teeth
or
jaws
tic
douloureux

are
induced
by
irritation

causes
tic
douloureux
the
unpleasant
sensation
sometimes
experienced
when
we
hear
the
grating
of
a
file
or
saw
is
produced
by
the
connection
of
the
nerve
that
passes
across
the
drum
of
the
ear
with
the
fifth
cranial
nerve
when
pressure
is
made
on
the
trunk
of
a
nerve
the
sensibility
of
the
part
where
the
nerve
ramifies
is
modified
this
is
illustrated
when
pressure
is
made
upon
the
large
nerve
of
the
lower
extremity
sciatic
in
sitting
upon
a
hard
bench
the
foot
is
then
said
to
be
asleep
when
the
trunk
of
a
nerve
is
diseased
or
injured
the
pain
is
experienced
in
the
outer
extremity
of
the
nerve
a
blow
upon
the
elbow
which
causes
a
peculiar
sensation
in
the
little
finger
and
one
side
of
the
ring
finger
affords
a
familiar
illustration
this
sensation
is
produced
by
injuring
the
ulnar
nerve
which
is
distributed
to
the
little
finger
of
these
are
the
third
sixth
and
twelfth
pairs
of
cranial
nerves
and
the
pairs
of
spinal
nerves
these
nerves
are
distributed
to
the
fibres
of
the
five
hundred
muscles
of
the
body
the
functions
of
the
muscular
are
different
from
those
of
the
sensitive
nerves
the
former
are
provided
for
the
purpose
of
motion
and
not
of
feeling
hence
muscles
may
be
cut
and
the
pain
will
be
slight
compared
with
the
cutting
of
the
skin
this
may
be
called
muscular
pain
weariness
is
a
sensation
recognized
by
one
set
of
muscular
nerves
so
uniformly
is
a
separate
instrument
provided
for
every
additional
function
that
there
is
strong
reason
to
regard
the
muscular
nerves
although
running
in
one
sheath
as
in
reality
double
and
performing
distinct
functions
sir
charles
bell
in
his
work
on
the
nervous
system
endeavors
to
show
that
one
set
of
nervous
fibres
conveys
the
mandate
from
the
brain
to
the
muscle
and
excites
the
contraction
and
that
another
set
conveys
from
the
muscle
to
the
brain
a
peculiar
sense
of
the
state
or
degree
of
contraction
of
the
muscle
by
which
we
are
enabled
to
judge
of
the
amount
of
stimulus
necessary
to
accomplish
the
end
desired
this
is
obviously
an
indispensable
piece
of
information
to
the

only

say
of

when

him

there
is

in

can
not

a
strong
tendency
to
the
diseases
from
which
the
parents
suffered
when
both
parents
have
similar
defects
or
have
descended
from
tainted
families
the
children
are
usually
more
deeply
impressed
with
their
imperfections
than
when
only
one
possesses
the
defect
this
is
the
reason
of
the
frequency
of
nervous
disease
and
imbecility
among
the
opulent
as
intermarriages
among
near
relations
are
more
frequent
with
this
class
than
among
the
poor
the
hygiene
of
the
nervous
why
is
it
important
to
know
the
laws
which
regulate
the
action
of
the
brain
what
is
necessary
that
the
action
of
the
brain
be
healthy
and
efficient
what
follows
if
the
brain
of
the
child
has
inherited
defects
what
is
the
effect
when
both
parents
possess
similar
defects
among
some
of
the
reigning
families
of
europe
particularly
the
spanish
the
folly
of
intermarriage
among
themselves
is
strongly
illustrated
the
high
and
noble
talents
that
characterized
their
progenitors
are
not
seen
but
there
is
now
exhibited
among
their
descendants
imbecility
and
the
most
revolting
forms
of
nervous
disease
unhappily
it
is
not
merely
as
a
cause
of
disease
that
hereditary
predisposition
is
to
be
dreaded
the
obstacles
which
it
throws
in
the
way
of
permanent
recovery
are
even
more
formidable
and
can
never
be
entirely
removed
safety
is
to
be
found
only
in
avoiding
the
perpetuation
of
the
mischief
therefore
if
two
persons
each
naturally
of
excitable
and
delicate
nervous
temperament
choose
to
unite
for
life
they
have
themselves
to
blame
for
the
concentrated
influence
of
similar
tendencies
in
destroying
the
health
of
their
offspring
and
subjecting
them
to
all
the
miseries
of
nervous
disease
madness
or
melancholy
the
command
of
god
not
to
marry
within
certain
degrees
of
consanguinity
is
in
accordance
with
the
organic
laws
of
the
brain
and
the
wisdom
of
the
prohibition
is
confirmed
by
observation
the
inhabitants
females
particularly
of
the
islands
of
america
are
more
affected
with
nervous
diseases
than
those
who
reside
upon
the
mainland
the
prevalence
of
these
affections
is
ascribed
to
the
frequent
intermarriage
of
persons
closely
related
by
blood
what
is
one
cause
of
nervous
disease
among
the
higher
classes
what
is
true
of
some
of
the
reigning
families
of
europe
why
is
hereditary
predisposition
to
be
dreaded
is
the
prohibition
of
god
respecting
intermarriage
in

with
the
organic
laws
of

said
of
the
inhabitants
of

of
pure
this
organ
receives
an
unusually
large
supply
of
blood
in
comparison
with
the
rest
of
the
body
it
is
estimated
that
one
tenth
of
all
the
blood
sent
from
the
heart
goes
to
this
organ
if
the
arterial
blood
be
altogether
withdrawn
or
a
person
breathes
air
that
is
filled
with
carbonic
gas
the
brain
ceases
its
proper
action
and

with
consciousness
becomes
extinct
if
a
person
lose
a
considerable
quantity
of
blood
dizziness
and
loss
of
consciousness
follow
this
results
from
the
brain
not
receiving
a
sufficient
amount
of
blood
to
sustain
its
functions
when
an
individual
descends
into
a
well
or
pit
that
contains
carbonic
acid
the

is
not
changed
or
purified
in
the
lungs
and
loss
of

and
death
soon
follow
the
slighter
variations
in
the
state
of
the
blood
have
equally
sure
though
less
palpable
effects
if
its
vitality
is
impaired
by
breathing
an
atmosphere
so
much
vitiated
as
to
be
insufficient
to
produce
the
proper
degree
of
oxygenation
the
blood
then
affords
an
imperfect
stimulus
to
the
brain
as
a
necessary
consequence
languor
and
inactivity
of
the
mental
and
nervous
functions
ensue
and
a
tendency
to
headache
fainting
or
hysteria
makes
its
appearance
let
a
person
remain
for
a
time
in
a
crowded
hall
or
church
and
headache
or
faintness
is
generally
produced
this
is
caused
by
the
action
of
impure
blood
upon
the
brain
if
a
wishes
to
have
his
pupils
on
the
day
of
examination
appear
creditably
he
will
be
careful
to
have
the
room
well
ventilated
ventilating
churches
might
prevent
the
inattention
and
sleepiness
that
are
observed
during
the
afternoon
service
why
does
the
brain
require
a
due
supply
of
pure
blood
what
is
the
effect
when
a
person
loses
a
considerable
quantity
of

what
causes
the
loss
of

when
carbonic
acid
is
breathed
what
effects
are
produced
by
slight
variations
in
the
quality
of
the
blood
from
the
following
observations
give
some
of
the
effects
of
impure
blood
on
the
brain
in
many
instances
the
transmission
of
imperfectly
oxygenated
blood
to
the
brain
is
an
influential
cause
in
the
production
of
nervous
disease
and
delicacy
of
constitution
the
only
efficient
remedy
for
these
conditions
is
a
supply
of
pure
blood
to
the
brain
brain
should
be
called
into
this
organ
like
the
muscles
should
be
used
and
then
allowed
to
rest
or
cease
from
vigorous
thought
when
the
brain
is
properly
called
into
action
by
moderate
study
it
increases
in
size
and
strength
while
on
the
other
hand
if
it
is
not
used
the
action
of
this
organ
is
enfeebled
thereby
diminishing
the
function
of
all
parts
of
the
body
the
brain
being
an
organized
part
is
subject
so
far
as
regards
exercise
to
the
same
laws
as
the
other
organs
of
the
body
if
it
is
doomed
to
inactivity
its
size
diminishes
its
health
decays
and
the
mental
operations
and
feelings
as
a
necessary
consequence
become
dull
feeble
and
slow
if
it
is
duly
exercised
after
regular
intervals
of
repose
the
mind
acquires
readiness
and
strength
lastly
if
it
is
overtasked
either
in
the
force
or
duration
of
its
activity
its
functions
become
impaired
and
irritability
and
disease
take
the
place
of
health
and
vigor
the
consequences
of
inadequate
exercise
will
first
be
explained
we
have
seen
that
by
disuse
the
muscles
become
emaciated
the
bones
soften
and
the
are
obliterated
the
brain
is
no
exception
to
this
general
rule
it
is
impaired
by
permanent
inactivity
and
becomes
less
fit
to
manifest
the
mental
powers
with
readiness
and
energy
nor
will
this
surprise
any
reflecting
person
who
considers
that
the
brain
as
a
part
of
the
same
animal
system
is
nourished
by
the
same
blood
and
regulated
by
the
same
vital
laws
as
the
muscles
bones
and
arteries
why
should
the
brain
be
called
into
action
what
is
the
effect
if
the
brain
is
doomed
to
inactivity
show
the
consequences
of
disuse
of
the
organs
mentioned
in
preceding
chapters
does
the
same
principle
apply
to
the
brain
it
is
the
weakening
and
depressing
effect
which
is
induced
by
the
absence
of
the
stimulus
necessary
for
the
healthy
exercise
of
the
brain
that
renders
solitary
confinement
so
severe
a
punishment
even
to
the
most
daring
minds
keeping
the
above
principle
in
view
we
shall
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
of
the
brain
and
nervous
system
or
in
other
words
inactivity
of
intellect
and
feeling
is
a
very
frequent
predisposing
cause
of
every
form
of
nervous
disease
for
demonstrative
evidence
of
this
position
we
have
only
to
look
at
the
numerous
victims
to
be
found
among
females
of
the
middle
and
higher
ranks
who
have
no
calls
to
exertion
in
gaining
the
means
of
subsistence
and
no
objects
of
interest
on
which
to
exercise
their
mental
faculties
and
who
consequently
sink
into
a
state
of
mental
sloth
and
nervousness
which
not
only
deprives
them
of
much
enjoyment
but
subjects
them
to
suffering
both
of
body
and
mind
from
the
slightest
causes
but
let
the
situation
of
such
persons
be
changed
bring
them
for
instance
from
the
listlessness
of
retirement
to
the
business
and
bustle
of
the
city
give
them
a
variety
of
imperative
employments
and
so
place
them
in
society
as
to
supply
to
their
cerebral
organs
that
extent
of
exercise
which
gives
health
and
vivacity
of
action
and
in
a
few
months
the
change
produced
will
be
surprising
health
animation
and
energy
will
take
the
place
of
former
insipidity
and
dulness
an
additional
illustration
involving
an
important
principle
in
the
production
of
many
distressing
forms
of
disease
will
be
found
in
the
case
of
a
man
of
mature
age
and
of
active
habits
who
has
devoted
his
life
to
the
toils
of
business
and
whose
hours
of
leisure
have
been
few
and
short
suppose
such
a
person
to
retire
to
the
country
in
search
of
repose
and
to
have
no
moral
religious
or
philosophical
pursuits
to
occupy
his
attention
and
keep
up
the
active
exercise
of
his
brain
this
organ
will
lose
its
health
and
the
inevitable
result
will
be
weariness
of
life
despondency
or
some
other
variety
of
nervous
disease
what
renders
solitary
confinement
so
severe
a
punishment
to
the
most
daring
minds
what
is
a
predisposing
cause
of
nervous
disease
in
what
classes
do
mental
and
nervous
debility
prevail
how
can
this
be
counteracted
give
another
illustration
showing
how
disease
of
the
brain
is
induced
one
great
evil
attending
the
absence
of
some
imperative
employment
or
object
of
interest
to
exercise
the
mind
and
brain
is
the
tendency
which
it
generates
to
waste
the
mental
energies
on
every
trifling
occurrence
which
presents
itself
and
to
seek
relief
in
the
momentary
excitement
of
any
sensation
however
unworthy
the
best
remedy
for
these
evils
is
to
create
occupation
to
interest
the
mind
and
give
that
wholesome
exercise
to
the
brain
which
its
constitution
requires
evils
arising
from
excessive
or
exercise
of
the
brain
or
any
of
its
parts
are
when
we
use
the
eye
too
long
or
in
too
bright
a
light
it
becomes
bloodshot
the
increased
action
of
its
vessels
and
nerves
gives
rise
to
a
sensation
of
fatigue
and
pain
requiring
us
to
desist
if
we
relieve
the
eye
the
irritation
gradually
subsides
and
the
healthy
state
returns
but
if
we
continue
to
look
intently
or
resume
our
employment
before
the
eye
has
regained
its
natural
state
by
repose
the
irritation
at
last
becomes
permanent
and
disease
followed
by
weakness
of
vision
or
even
blindness
may
ensue
phenomena
precisely
analogous
occur
when
from
intense
mental
excitement
the
brain
is
kept
long
in
a
state
of
excessive
activity
the
only
difference
is
that
we
can
always
see
what
happens
in
the
eye
but
rarely
what
takes
place
in
the
brain
occasionally
however
cases
of
fracture
of
the
skull
occur
in
which
part
of
the
bone
being
removed
we
can
see
the
quickened
circulation
in
the
vessels
of
the
brain
as
easily
as
those
of
the
eye
what
is
one
great
evil
attending
the
absence
of
some
imperative
employment
to
exercise
the
mind
and
brain
what
is
the
true
remedy
for
these
evils
from
what
other
cause
do
evils
arise
to
the
brain
explain
the
evil
of
it
by
the
excessive
use
of
the
eye
what
is
the
only
difference
in
the
analogy
of
the
phenomena
of
the
eye
and
brain
has
the
analogy
been
verified
sir
astley
cooper
had
a
young
man
brought
to
him
who
had
lost
a
portion
of
his
skull
just
above
the
eyebrow
on
examining
the
head
says
sir
astley
i
distinctly
saw
that
the
pulsation
of
the
brain
was
regular
and
slow
but
at
this
time
he
was
agitated
by
some
opposition
to
his
wishes
and
directly
the
blood
was
sent
with
increased
force
to
the
brain
and
the
pulsation
became
frequent
and
violent
indeed
in
many
instances
the
increased
circulation
in
the
brain
attendant
on
mental
excitement
reveals
itself
when
least
expected
and
leaves
traces
after
death
which
are
very
perceptible
when
tasked
beyond
its
strength
the
eye
becomes
insensible
to
light
and
no
longer
conveys
any
impressions
to
the
mind
in
like
manner
the
brain
when
much
exhausted
becomes
incapable
of
thought
and
consciousness
is
almost
lost
in
a
feeling
of
utter
confusion
any
time
of
life
excessive
and
continued
mental
exertion
is
but
in
infancy
and
early
youth
when
the
structure
of
the
brain
is
still
immature
and
delicate
permanent
mischief
is
more
easily
produced
by
injudicious
treatment
than
at
any
subsequent
period
in
this
respect
the
analogy
is
as
complete
between
the
brain
and
the
other
parts
of
the
body
as
that
exemplified
in
the
injurious
effects
of
premature
exercise
of
the
bones
and
muscles
scrofulous
and
rickety
children
are
the
most
usual
sufferers
in
this
way
they
are
generally
remarkable
for
large
heads
great
precocity
of
understanding
and
small
delicate
bodies
but
in
such
instances
the
great
size
of
the
brain
and
the
acuteness
of
the
mind
are
the
results
of
morbid
growth
even
with
the
best
of
management
the
child
passes
the
first
years
of
its
life
constantly
on
the
brink
of
active
disease
relate
the
case
detailed
by
sir
astley
cooper
may
the
increased
functional
action
of
the
brain
change
its
structure
at
what
age
particularly
is
excessive
and
continued
mental
exertion
hurtful
what
is
said
of
scrofulous
and
rickety
children
instead
however
of
trying
to
repress
its
mental
activity
the
fond
parents
misled
by
the
early
promise
of
genius
too
often
excite
it
still
further
by
unceasing
cultivation
and
the
stimulus
of
praise
finding
its
progress
for
a
time
equal
to
their
warmest
wishes
they
look
forward
with
ecstasy
to
the
day
when
its
talents
will
break
forth
and
shed
lustre
on
its
name
but
in
exact
proportion
as
the
picture
becomes
brighter
to
their
fancy
the
probability
of
its
being
realized
becomes
less
for
the
brain
worn
out
by
premature
exertion
either
becomes
diseased
or
loses
its
tone
leaving
the
mental
powers
imbecile
and
depressed
for
the
remainder
of
life
the
expected
prodigy
is
thus
easily
outstripped
in
the
social
race
by
many
whose
dull
outset
promised
him
an
easy
victory
taking
for
our
guide
the
necessities
of
the
constitution
it
will
be
obvious
that
the
modes
of
treatment
commonly
resorted
to
ought
to
be
reversed
instead
of
straining
to
the
utmost
the
already
irritable
powers
of
the
precocious
child
and
leaving
his
dull
competitor
to
ripen
at
leisure
a
systematic
attempt
ought
to
be
made
from
early
infancy
to
rouse
to
action
the
languid
faculties
of
the
latter
while
no
pains
ought
to
be
spared
to
moderate
and
give
tone
to
the
activity
of
the
former
instead
of
this
however
the
prematurely
intelligent
child
is
sent
to
school
and
tasked
with
lessons
at
an
unusually
early
age
while
the
healthy
but
more
backward
boy
who
requires
to
be
stimulated
is
kept
at
home
in
idleness
perhaps
for
two
or
three
years
longer
merely
on
account
of
his
backwardness
a
double
error
is
here
committed
the
consequences
to
the
intelligent
boy
are
frequently
the
permanent
loss
both
of
health
and
of
his
envied
superiority
of
intellect
how
are
such
children
usually
managed
what
is
the
cause
of
their
early
promise
and
subsequent
disappointment
what
mode
of
treatment
should
be
adopted
in
educating
precocious
children
how
should
the
dull
or
less
active
child
be
treated
what
is
the
usual
course
in
youth
too
much
mischief
is
done
by
the
long
daily
period
of
attendance
at
school
and
the
continued
application
of
the
mind
which
the
ordinary
system
of
education
requires
the
law
of
exercise
that
action
exhausts
the
vital
powers
of
the
organ
applies
as
well
to
the
brain
as
to
the
muscles
hence
the
necessity
of
varying
the
occupations
of
the
young
and
allowing
frequent
intervals
of
exercise
in
the
open
air
instead
of
enforcing
the
continued
confinement
now
so
common
it
is
no
unusual
occurrence
that
on
examination
day
the
best
scholars
appear
indifferently
this
may
be
the
result
of
nervous
exhaustion
produced
by
extra
mental
effort
in
preparing
for
the
final
examination
it
is
advisable
for
such
pupils
to
divert
their
minds
from
close
study
for
a
few
days
previous
to
examination
during
this
time
the
student
may
indulge
in
physical
recreation
social
intercourse
and
a
moderate
amount
of
reading
in
early
and
middle
life
fever
an
unusual
degree
of
cerebral
disorder
is
a
common
consequence
of
the
excessive
and
continued
excitement
of
the
brain
this
unhappy
result
is
brought
on
by
severe
study
unremitted
mental
exertion
anxiety
and
watching
nervous
disease
from
excessive
mental
labor
and
high
mental
excitement
sometimes
shows
itself
in
another
form
what
are
the
consequences
of
the
error
what
error
prevails
in
the
present
system
of

why

xl
hygiene
of
the
nervous
system
continued
having
pointed
out
the
evils
arising
both
from
inadequate
and
from
excessive
mental
exertion
it
remains
to
direct
the
attention
to
some
of
the
rules
which
should
guide
us
in
the
exercise
of
the
brain
should
not
enter
upon
continued
mental
exertion
or
arouse
deep
feeling
immediately
before
or
after
a
full
such
is
the
connection
between
the
mind
and
body
that
even
in
a
perfectly
healthy
person
unwelcome
news
sudden
anxiety
or
mental
excitement
occurring
soon
after
eating
will
impede
digestion
and
cause
the
stomach
to
loathe
the
masticated
food
the
worst
forms
of
indigestion
and
nervous
depression
are
those
which
arise
from
excessive
mental
application
or
depressed
feeling
conjoined
with
unrestrained
indulgence
in
the
pleasures
of
the
table
in
such
circumstances
the
stomach
and
brain
react
upon
and
disturb
each
other
till
all
the
horrors
of
nervous
disease
make
their
unwelcome
appearance
and
render
life
miserable
too
many
literary
men
and
students
know
this
from
sad
experience
should
engage
in
intense
study
in
the
early
part
of
the
nature
has
allotted
the
darkness
of
the
night
for
repose
and
for
restoration
by
sleep
of
the
exhausted
energies
of
mind
and
body
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening
if
study
or
composition
be
ardently
engaged
in
the
increased
action
of
the
brain
which
always
accompanies
activity
of
mind
requires
a
long
time
to
subside
if
the
individual
possesses
a
nervous
temperament
he
will
be
sleepless
for
hours
after
he
has
retired
or
perhaps
be
tormented
by
unpleasant
dreams
why
should
we
not
arouse
deep
feeling
immediately
before
or
after
eating
a
full
meal
how
are
the
worst
forms
of
indigestion
and
nervous
depression
produced
what
class
of
men
know
this
from
sad
experience
what
evils
arise
from
studious
application
at
night
it
is
therefore
of
great
advantage
to
enter
upon
intense
mental
application
early
in
the
day
and
to
devote
several
of
the
hours
which
precede
bedtime
to
entertaining
conversation
music
and
lighter
reading
the
vascular
excitement
previously
induced
in
the
brain
by
study
has
then
time
to
subside
and
sound
refreshing
sleep
is
much
more
certainly
obtained
this
rule
is
of
great
consequence
to
those
who
are
obliged
to
undergo
much
mental
labor
the
idea
of
gathering
wisdom
by
burning
the
midnight
oil
is
more
poetical
than
profitable
the
best
time
to
use
the
brain
is
during
the
day
close
student
and
the
growing
child
need
more
sleep
than
the
idler
or
the
as
steep
is
the
natural
repose
of
all
organs
it
follows
that
the
more
the
brain
and
other
organs
of
the
system
are
employed
the
more
repose
they
require
the
organs
of
the
child
beside
sustaining
their
proper
functions
are
busy
in
promoting
its
growth
this
nutritive
process
is
attended
with
a
certain
degree
of
exhaustion
the
impaired
health
of
children
often
results
from
a
disregard
of
this
principle
but
on
the
other
hand
an
excess
of
sleep
produces
feebleness
by
preventing
the
proper
exercise
of
the
mind
as
well
as
the
body
length
of
time
the
brain
may
be
advantageously
used
is
modified
by
many
the
power
of
the
brain
in
different
persons
to
endure
action
is
various
this
is
modified
by
its
primary
character
by
development
and
age
by
habits
of
action
by
the
health
of
the
cerebral
organ
and
general
system
by
the
moral
feelings
and
other
conditions
why
should
we
engage
in
intense
study
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
what
persons
require
the
most
sleep
why
what
is
said
relative
to
the
length
of
time
that
the
brain
can
be
advantageously
used
give
a
condition
that
modifies
the
amount
of
mental
labor
the
primary
physical
organization
of
some
individuals
is
such
that
they
are
enabled
to
endure
with
impunity
an
amount
of
mental
labor
that
would
disorder
if
not
destroy
functionally
the
cerebral
organ
of
others
differently
constituted
napoleon
bonaparte
was
of
this
number
there
can
be
no
fixed
period
for
mental
labor
that
may
be
adopted
as
a
rule
for
all
persons
whose
systems
are
maturely
developed
much
less
is
there
a
proper
definite
period
for
study
that
is
applicable
to
all
children
the
practice
of
retaining
pupils
of
all
ages
from
five
to
twenty
years
in
the
the
same
period
of
time
for
the
purpose
of
study
is
not
predicated
upon
any
law
of
physiology
an
exercise
of
three
hours
with
one
or
two
recesses
of
ten
minutes
each
may
profit
the
eldest
class
two
hours
with
a
recess
of
ten
minutes
the
middle
class
while
one
hour
or
one
hour
and
a
half
with
one
recess
would
be
as
long
a
period
as
the
youngest
pupils
should
be
retained
in
the
at
one
session
a
person
who
is
accustomed
to
muscular
exertion
will
endure
a
longer
period
of
physical
toil
than
one
who
is
not
inured
to
it
so
it
is
with
mental
labor
if
the
brain
has
been
habituated
to
mental
action
and
profound
study
it
will
not
be
so
soon
fatigued
as
when
not
accustomed
to
such
exertions
consequently
an
amount
of
mental
labor
may
be
performed
with
impunity
at
one
time
that
would
exhaust
and
cause
serious
disease
of
the
cerebral
organ
at
another
persons
that
commence
a
course
of
study
at
a
late
period
in
life
frequently
evince
their
zeal
at
the
commencement
by
poring
over
their
books
twelve
or
more
hours
each
day
the
progress
of
such
students
is
soon
arrested
by
physical
and
mental
depression
in
such
instances
it
would
be
more
judicious
to
commence
with
only
three
or
four
hours
vigorous
application
each
day
and
gradually
protract
the
period
of
study
five
or
more
minutes
every
successive
day
until
the
brain
may
be
called
into
vigorous
action
six
or
eight
hours
with
impunity
why
can
there
be
no
fixed
period
for
mental
labor
what
is
said
of
the
practice
of
retaining
pupils
of
all
ages
the
same
period
of
time
in
the
show
that
the
action
of
the
brain
is
influenced
by
habit
as
well
as
the
muscular
system
what
suggestion
to
those
persons
that
commence
a
course
of
study
at
a
late
period
in
life
the
amount
of
mental
power
is
greatly
influenced
by
the
general
health
such
is
the
intimate
connection
of
the
different
parts
of
the
system
particularly
the
digestive
apparatus
with
the
cerebral
organs
that
except
there
be
vigor
of
constitution
and
freedom
from
disease
mental
efforts
will
be
feeble
and
of
little
avail
the
prevalent
opinion
that
individuals
who
are
feeble
or
diseased
may
acquire
a
collegiate
education
and
thus
become
useful
to
themselves
and
the
community
is
very
generally
erroneous
such
persons
should
enter
upon
a
daily
and
systematic
course
of
physical
training
and
their
labor
should
be
in
the
open
air
in
order
that
the
system
may
be
invigorated
and
freed
from
disease
the
moral
feelings
exert
a
controlling
influence
over
the
functions
of
the
muscular
digestive
and
respiratory
organs
they
also
exert
an
influence
perhaps
more
powerful
upon
the
nervous
system
while
fear
and
anxiety
depress
hope
and
the
enlivening
emotions
facilitate
the
functional
activity
of
the
brain
and
increase
its
power
for
mental
exertion
by
a
proper
and
systematic
education
of
the
moral
feelings
they
are
not
only
a
source
of
happiness
and
productive
of
right
conduct
but
aid
in
the
culture
of
the
intellect
consequently
we
should
cultivate
a
feeling
of
hopeful
trust
in
the
future
and
a
firm
reliance
upon
the
laws
which
the
creator
has
given
us
for
our
guidance
show
that
the
amount
of
mental
power
is
modified
by
the
general
health
what
is
said
of
feeble
persons
acquiring
a
collegiate
education
do
the
moral
feelings
exert
a
controlling
influence
over
the
principal
functions
of
the
system
what
is
the
effect
of
a
proper
and
systematic
culture
of
the
moral
feelings
is
very
important
in
exercising
the
moral
and
intellectual
periodicity
or
a
tendency
to
resume
the
same
mode
of
action
at
stated
times
is
peculiarly
the
characteristic
of
the
nervous
system
if
we
repeat
any
kind
of
mental
effort
every
day
at
the
same
hour
we
at
last
find
ourselves
entering
upon
it
without
premeditation
when
the
time
approaches
in
like
manner
if
we
arrange
our
studies
in
accordance
with
this
law
and
take
up
each
in
the
same
order
a
natural
aptitude
is
soon
produced
which
renders
application
more
easy
than
by
resuming
the
subjects
as
accident
may
direct
when
engaged
in
abstruse
studies
it
may
be
found
advantageous
to
pursue
others
that
are
less
difficult
the
intense
application
of
the
brain
which
is
requisite
in
the
one
instance
is
relieved
by
directing
the
attention
to
a
study
that
requires
less
thought
by
this
change
there
is
mental
relaxation
attended
with
invigoration
of
the
cerebral
organ
or
it
may
be
explained
by
assuming
that
the
brain
is
composed
of
an
aggregate
of
distinct
organs
each
of
which
is
called
into
action
in
pursuing
different
studies
effective
study
is
impossible
if
the
powers
of
the
brain
are
depressed
when
the
cerebral
organ
has
been
temporarily
debilitated
by
protracted
intellectual
efforts
it
is
ineffectual
to
attempt
any
concentrated
mental
exercise
this
condition
of
the
nervous
system
is
indicated
by
confusion
of
thought
and
inability
to
attain
results
that
usually
follow
similar
efforts
mental
rest
in
these
cases
is
required
students
frequently
fail
in
solving
mathematical
problems
when
the
mind
is
prostrated
by
continued
and
excessive
effort
to
obtain
a
solution
not
unfrequently
after
a
night
rest
the
problem
is
quickly
solved
and
the
pupil
thinks
he
dreamed
it
out
the
true
explanation
is
rest
invigorated
the
exhausted
brain
which
fitted
it
for
vigorous
and
successful
thought
why
is
regularity
of
great
importance
in
exercising
the
moral
and
intellectual
powers
what
suggestion
when
pursuing
abstruse
studies
how
explained
when
is
effective
study
impossible
how
is
this
condition
of
the
nervous
system
indicated
intellect
should
not
be
cultivated
to
the
neglect
of
the
moral
and
physical
all
the
faculties
require
for
their
development
regular
exercise
alternated
with
intervals
of
rest
this
is
as
necessary
to
the
due
development
of
the
moral
feelings
of
a
child
as
in
physical
training
and
mental
culture
consequently
those
schools
are
to
be
preferred
in
the
education
of
youth
where
the
physical
intellectual
and
moral
faculties
receive
each
day
a
due
share
of
attention
and
culture
the
continuance
of
healthy
and
vigorous
action
in
the
matured
physical
mental
and
moral
powers
requires
frequent
and
regular
action
alternated
with
rest
as
much
as
in
their
development
consequently
those
who
cultivate
one
or
two
of
these
faculties
to
the
neglect
of
the
others
exhibit
a
marked
deficiency
of
acuteness
and
vigor
in
those
not
exercised
this
defect
reacts
on
the
powers
that
are
vigorous
diminishing
the
energy
and
deteriorating
all
the
other
faculties
of
man
if
the
principles
before
mentioned
are
true
the
adult
as
well
as
the
child
should
spend
a
part
of
each
day
in
some
proper
physical
employment
another
portion
should
be
appropriated
to
intellectual
pursuits
while
another
should
be
sedulously
devoted
to
the
cultivation
of
the
moral
feelings
disease
of
the
corporeal
system
more
frequently
occurs
when
only
one
set
of
faculties
is
used
than
when
all
are
equally
employed
this
is
particularly
true
of
nervous
and
mental
disease
which
follows
and
is
caused
by
either
high
intellectual
action
or
intense
moral
emotions
without
a
due
amount
of
physical
exercise
how
is
the
dreaming
out
of
problems
explained
what
is
said
of
the
culture
of
the
intellect
what
schools
are
preferable
in
the
education
of
youth

exercise
its

neither
will
receive
that

object
had
engaged
the
mind
although
the
brain
will
direct
several
operations
at
the

time
when
only
slight
mental
effort
is
required
yet
when
one
operation
becomes
difficult
or
demands
special
attention
of
the
mind
the
other
will
be
suspended
this
is
illustrated
in
social
conversation
while
walking
let
it
become
necessary
to
concentrate
the
nervous
power
upon
the
motor
organs
and
the

none
of
those
influences
that
promote
the
proper
functions
of

and
tend
to
increase

ease
should
be
neglected
for
if
the

is
occupied
with
disagreeable
sensations
it
can
not
concentrate
its

in
the
various
employments
of
man
the

be
arranged
with

and
not
with
the

of

cell
and
the
benches
in
every
respect
be
adapted
to
the
different
scholars
so
that
the
position
of
each
may
be
comfortable
and
we
mistake
if
there
is
not
a
greater
improvement
in
a
given
time
in
such
a
school
than
where
there
is
an
apparent
disregard

impression
on
the
the
necessity
of

repetition
in

moral
education
is
in
fact
too
little
adverted
to
because
the
principle
which
renders
it
efficacious
has
not
been
understood
to
induce
facility
of
action
in
the
organs
of
the
mind
practice
is
as
essential
as
it
is
in
the
organs
of
motion
in
physical
education
we
are
aware
of
the
advantages
of
repetition
we
know
that
if
practice
in
dancing
fencing
skating
and
riding
is
persevered
in
for
a
length
of
time
sufficient
to
give
the
muscles
the
requisite
promptitude
and
harmony
of
action
the
power
will
be
ever
afterward
retained
although
little
called
into
use
whereas
if
the
muscles
have
not
been
duly
trained
we
may
reiterate
practice
at
different
intervals
without
proportionate
advancement
the

principle
applies
equally
to
the
moral
and
intellectual
powers
because
these
operate
by

of
material
organs
according
to
this
principle
it
follows
that
in
learning
a
language
or
science
six
successive
months
of
application
will
be
more
effectual
in
fixing
it
in
the
mind
and
making
it
a
part
of
its
furniture
than
double
or
treble
the
time
if
the
lessons
are
interrupted
by
long
intervals
hence
it
is
a
great
error
to
begin
and
study
and
then
break
off
to
finish
at
a
later
period
the
fatigue
is
thus
doubled

the

the
best
way
is
to

at

this
accustoms
the

the
evil
arising
from

also
the
evil
of

they
can
be

here
the

no

a

the
sense
of
touch
sensation
is
the
perception
of
external
objects
by
means
of
the
senses
there
are
five
senses
namely
and
touch
is
the
sense
by
which
the
mind
becomes
acquainted
with
some
of
the
properties
of
bodies
and
enables
us
determine
whether
their
surfaces
are
smooth
or
rough
their
relative
temperature
and
to
a
certain
degree
their
form
and
weight
some
physiologists
make
a
distinction
between
the
sense
of
touch
and
tact
tact
or
feeling
is
more
general
extending
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
skin
and
mucous
membranes
while
touch
exists
chiefly
in
the
fingers
of
man
and
in
the
noses
of
certain
quadrupeds
in
the
exercise
of
these
functions
tact
is
considered
passive
as
when
any
part
of
the
system
comes
into
contact
with
another
body
a
sensation
of
its
presence
is
given
without
the
exercise
of
volition
on
the
contrary
touch
is
active
and
is
exercised
voluntarily
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
to
the
mind
a
knowledge
of
the
qualities
or
properties
of
the
surfaces
of
bodies
as
when
we
feel
of
a
piece
of
cloth
to
ascertain
its
qualities
or
a
polished
surface
to
prove
its
smoothness
in
man
the
hand
is
admirably
adapted
to
the
exercise
of
touch
the
fineness
of
the
skin
its
great
sensibility
the
species
of
cushion
formed
by
the
fat
at
the
extremities
of
the
fingers
the
length
and
flexibility
of
these
organs
and
the
capability
of
opposing
the
thumb
to
the
fingers
like
a
pair
of
forceps
are
so
many
conditions
essentially
favorable
to
the
delicacy
of
this
sense
and
enable
us
to
appreciate
with
exactitude
the
qualities
of
the
bodies
we
may
feel

how
many
senses
have

define
touch
what
is
the
difference
between
touch
and
tact
in
the
exercise
of
these
functions
which
is
active
and
which
passive
why
is
the
hand
so
admirably
adapted
to
the
exercise
of
the
sense
of
touch
the
nerves
that
supply
the
sense
of
touch
proceed
from
the
anterior
half
of
the
spinal
cord
where
this
sense
is
most
acute
and
delicate
we
find
the
greatest
number
of
sensitive
nervous
filaments
and
those
of
the
largest
size
in
amputating
limbs
and
other
surgical
operations
the
division
of
the
skin
causes
more
pain
than
all
the
subsequent
steps
of
the
operation
however
protracted
the
muscles
cellular
membrane
and
fat
have
but
little
sensibility
while
the
bones
tendons
and
ligaments
are
insensible
when
not
diseased
and
may
be
cut
without
causing
pain
hygiene
of
the
sense
of
touch
the
sense
of
touch
varies
in
different
persons
and
also
in
individuals
of
different
ages
thus
the
sensibilities
of
the
child
are
more
acute
than
those
of
the
aged
although
there
is
an
original
difference
of
sensibility
from
organization
still
the
function
of
the
nerves
of
sensation
is
modified
by
certain
influences
healthy
or
unhealthy
active
or
inactive
state
of
the
brain
influences
the
action
of
the
sensitive
in
sound
and
perfect
sleep
the
brain
is
inactive
in
this
state
ordinary
impressions
made
upon
the
skin
are
not
observed
by
the
sleeping
person
thus
the
arm
may
be
blistered
while
sleeping
when
exposed
to
the
warm
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
individual
will
not
be
aware
of
it
at
the
time
from
what
do
the
nerves
proceed
that
supply
this
sense
the
hygiene

a
condition
of
the

there
is
compression

the
same
is
true
when
the
mind
is
engaged
in
intense
thought
or
study
heat
or
cold
may
be
so
intense
as
to
disorganize
the
skin
and
not
to
be
noticed
the
varying
health
or
condition
of
the
brain
usually
depresses
or
increases
the
sensitiveness
of
the
skin
this
is
seen
in
grief
and
fear
which
diminish
while
hope
and
joy
increase
the
impressibility
of
this
tissue
it
is
not
uncommon
to
see
the
unfortunate
insane
endure
exposure
to
heat
and
cold
with
seeming
impunity
whereas
it
would
induce
almost
insupportable
suffering
to
the

the
skin
modifies
its
if
the

the
sensibility
of
the

will
be
impaired
this
is
demonstrated
by
noting
the
effects
of
cold
upon
the
cutaneous
tissue
the
application
of
which
contracts
the

drives
the
circulating
fluid
from
this

which
is
shown
by
the
paleness
as
well
as
by
the
shrivelled
appearance
of
the
skin
and
if
this
tissue
is
wounded
while
under
the
influence
of
cold
but
little
pain
will
be
felt
and
this
chilling
influence
may
be
carried
so
far
as
not

to
deprive
the

of
vitality

participate
in
this

anatomy
of

organs
of

the
tongue
is
a
double
organ
composed
chiefly
of
muscular
fibres
which
run
in
almost
every
direction
the
two
sides
are
so
perfectly
distinct
that
sometimes
in
paralysis
one
side
is
affected
while
the
function
of
the
other
remains
perfect
it
possesses
great
versatility
of
motion
and
can
be
moulded
into
a
great
variety
of
shapes
in
articulation
mastication
and
deglutition
the
tongue
is
an
auxiliary
to
other
organs
this
organ
is
abundantly
supplied
with
having
a
large

it
is
of
obvious
importance
that
these

should
act
in
concert
and
this
is
effected
by
the

some

impute
the

to
the

others
to
the

taste
is

of
substances
when

the
papillæ
dilate

themselves
and
the
particular
impression
excited
is
transmitted
to
the

through

this

is
closely
connected
with
that

the

are
strictly
sensual

and
contribute

if
dry

is
taken
the
tongue
carries
it
to
the
back
side
of
the
mouth
where
it
receives
secretions
from
the
salivary
glands
the
saliva
becoming
impregnated
with
its
flavor
flows
over
the
sides
of
the
tongue
and
gives
to
the
papillæ
a
perception
of
the
savory
juice
this
impression
is
then
communicated
to
the
brain
it
is
supposed
that
the
salts
which
enter
into

composition
of
the
saliva
are
very
efficient
agents
in
reducing
substances
to
a
proper
state
for
making
impressions
on
the
nerves
of
taste
the
fact
that
metals
impart
a
peculiar
taste
is
owing
to
a
galvanic
shock
and
not
properly
to
what
we
understand
by
taste
the
primary
use
of
taste
is
to
guide
animals
in
the
selection
of
food
and
to
warn
them
against
the
introduction
of
noxious
articles
into
the
stomach
in
all
the
inferior
animals
we
see
that
the
original
design
of
taste
is
still
answered
but
in
man
this
sense
has
been
so
abused
and
perverted
by
the
introduction
of
stimulants
and
condiments
and
the
endless
admixture
of
different
articles
of
food
that
the
simple
action
of
this
part
seems
to
have
been
superseded
almost
entirely
by
acquired
taste
in
children
this
sense
is
usually
acute
and
their
preference
is
for
food
of
the
mildest
character
and
it
is
also
true
that
every
person
has
some
peculiarities
of
taste
or
dislikes
to
particular
articles
of
food
this
may
be
either
constitutional
or
from
the
influence
of

how
is
this

what

in

this
sense
has
been
made
to
vary
more

by
the
refinements
of

thus
the
indian
like
or
dislike
to
particular
kinds
of

generally
extends
to
every
person
of
the
same
tribe
but
among
civilized
men
no
two
individuals
can
be
found
alike
in
all
their
tastes
this
sense
is
modified
by
habit
and
not
unfrequently
those
articles
which
at
first
were
disgusting
become
highly
agreeable
by
persevering
in
the
use
of
them
by
cultivation
this
sense
may
be
made
very
acute
those
persons
whose
business
leads
them
to
judge
of
the
quality
of
an
article
by
their
taste
can
discriminate
shades
of
flavor
not
perceivable
by

persons
epicures
and
tasters
of
wines
and

afford
examples
many

impair
their

by
bad
habits
as
chewing
and
smoking
tobacco
and
using
stimulating
drinks
and
pungent
condiments
with

these

lessen

physiology
of
the
organs
of

to
comprehend
the
theory
of

it
is
not
sufficient
to
know
the
structure
of
the
eye
we
must
be
familiar
with
some
of
the
properties
of
a
subtile
fluid
which
is
constantly
emanating
from
all
luminous
bodies
called
it
is
the
province
of
natural
philosophy
rather
than
physiology
to
enter
minutely
upon
the
properties
of
light
it
may
be
observed
however
that
when
light
passes
through
any
medium
of
the
same
density
the
rays
are
in
straight
lines
but
when
it
passes
from
one
medium
into
another
of
different
density
it
is
refracted
or
turned
from
a
straight
course
unless
it
strikes
the
medium
in
a
perpendicular
direction
then
light
passes
through
without
a
change
of
direction
when
a
ray
of
light
meets
with
a
body
it
either
passes
through
it
or
is
reflected
by
it
or
it
may
be
absorbed
again
in
proportion
as
the
rays
of
light
become
distant
from
the
body
from
which
they
emanate
they
diverge
one
from
the
other
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
optics
the
rays
of
light
in
passing
through
an
optical
instrument
like
the
eye
must
cross
each
other
and
thus
produce
an
inverted
image
of
the
object
from
which
the
rays
proceed
with
the
general
view
of
the
structure
of
the
eye
we
will
now
examine
the
use
of
each
part
in
the
function
of
vision
the
physiology
of
the
organs
of
what
is
necessary
in
order
to
understand
the
theory
of
vision
when
light
passes
through
a
medium
of
the
same
density
in
what
direction
will
be
its
rays
of
a
different
density
what
exception
when
light
meets
with
a
body
what
takes
place
what
is
said
in
reference
to
rays
of
light
in
passing
through
the
eye
the
sclerotic
coat
not
only
gives
form
to
the
body
of
the
eye
but
protection
to
the
interior
and
more
delicate
parts
the
choroid
coat
seems
to
be
chiefly
composed
of
a
tissue
of
nerves
and
minute
the
latter
give
nourishment
to
the
different
parts
of
the
eye
one
of
the
uses
of
this
coat
is
to
absorb
the
rays
of
light
immediately
after
they
have
passed
through
the
retina
this
is
effected
by
the
black
pigment
that
lines
its
inner
surface
were
it
not
for
this
provision
light
would
be
too
intense
and
vision
indistinct
in
albinos
where
there
is
an
absence
of
the
black
pigment
the
rays
of
light
traverse
the
iris
and
even
the
choroid
coat
and
so
overwhelm
the
eye
with
light
that
their
vision
is
quite
imperfect
except
in
the
dimness
of
evening
or
at
night
in
the
manufacture
of
optical
instruments
care
is
taken
to
color
their
interior
black
for
the
same
object
namely
the
absorption
of
scattered
rays
the
iris
by
means
of
its
powers
of
expansion
and
contraction
regulates
the
quantity
of
light
admitted
through
the
pupil
if
the
iris
is
thin
and
the
rays
of
light
pass
through
its
substance
they
are
immediately
absorbed
by
the
uvea
and
if
that
layer
be
insufficient
they
are
taken
up
by
the
black
pigment
of
the
choroid
coat
when
we
look
toward
the
bottom
of
the
eye
the
pupil
appears
like
a
black
spot
instead
of
an
opening
this
is
caused
by
seeing
the
black
pigment
through
the
retina
and
humors
of
the
eye
what
is
the
use
of
the
sclerotic
coat
of
what
is
the
choroid
coat
chiefly
composed
what
is
the
use
of
this
coat
how
is
it
effected
what
is
said
of
albinos
what
care
is
taken
in
the
manufacture
of
optical
instruments
what
is
the
use
of
the
iris
when
we
look
toward
the
bottom
of
the
eye
why
does
the
pupil
look
like
a
black
spot
instead
of
an
opening
the
cornea
and
the
aqueous
crystalline
and
vitreous
humors
are
transparent
so
that
rays
of
light
traverse
these
parts
of
the
eye
and
fall
upon
the
retina
the
office
of
these
humors
and
the
cornea
is
to
refract
the
rays
of
light
in
such
proportion
as
to
direct
the
image
in
the
most
favorable
manner
upon
the
retina
the
office
of
the
retina
is
to
receive
the
impression
of
the
rays
of
light
which
leave
an
object
at
which
we
look
and
it
is
upon
it
that
a
small
but
very
clear
image
of
that
object
is
formed
the
impression
thus
produced
by
the
reflected
light
is
transmitted
by
the
optic
nerve
to
the
brain
which
receives
the
sensation
this
constitutes
vision
the
optic
nerve
has
but
one
function
that
of

sensibility
is
conferred
on
this
organ
by
a
large

these

however

some
nervous
filaments

the

number
of
sensitive
nervous
filaments
renders
the

very
impressible

impair

destroy
vision
although

induce

these

the

remedies
the

again
the
refracting
power
of
lenses
is
modified
by
their
convexity
or
concavity
the
more
convex
a
lens
is
the
shorter
the

where
the
different
refracted
rays
converge
to
a

to
adapt
the

at

requires
a
change
in
the
refracting
power
of
some
of
the
transparent
mediums
of
the
eye
both
surfaces
of
the
crystalline
lens
are
oval
not
spherical

the
refraction
of

is
mainly
effected
in

change
the
inclination
of
this
lens
so
that
different
portions
of
its
anterior
surface
shall
be
directly
behind
the

and
its
refracting
power
is
increased
or
diminished
as
the
surface
presented
is
more

less
convex
to

objects
at

a
less
convex
lens
is
needed
than
in
examining
articles
very
near
the
eye
and
this
organ
from
its
structure
has
the
power
of
adaptation
to
different
distances
it
is
supposed
that
the
muscular
substance
of
the
ciliary
body
and
processes
changes
by
its
contraction
the
inclination
of
the
crystalline
lens
without
this
or
some
other
adapting
power
a
picture
of
objects
at
different
distances
would
not
be
formed
upon
the

and
the
vision
of
every
person
would
be
defective
except
in
reference
to
objects
at
certain
definite
distances
from
the
eye
what
modifies
the
refracting
power
of
lenses
what
is
necessary
to
adapt
the
eye
to
view
objects
at
different
distances
where
is
the
refraction
of
the
rays
of
light
mainly
effected
when
we
view
objects
at
a

what
kind
of

is
required
has
the
eye
the
power
of
adapting
itself
to
different
distances
how
is
it
effected
it
is
well
known
that
a
separate
image
is
formed
on
each
eye
and
if
they
are
not
in
the
same
direction
the
objects
will
appear
double
this
is
proved
by
pressing
one
eye
so
that
the
rays
of
light
can
not
enter
it
in
the
same
direction
as
they
do
in
the
other
consequently
the
vision
is
double
by
the
action
of
the
muscles
of
the
eye
it
is
turned
in
different
directions
so
that
objects
can
be
examined
upon
each
side
as
well
as
in
front
without
turning
the
body
by
the
slight
or
intense
action
of
the
straight
muscles
the
eye
is
more
or
less
compressed
and
the
form
of
the
globe
is
changed
together
with
the
relative
positions
of
the
different

this
modification
also
adapts
the

is
one
reason
why

minute
objects
near

also
to

so
arranged
that
it
can
be
relaxed
or
tightened
this
membrane
when
healthy
has
no
opening
and
it
must
be
apparent
that
the
apprehension
which
is
often
expressed
that
insects
will
penetrate
further
is
groundless
the
pain
is
owing
to
the
extreme
sensibility
of
the
membrana
tympani
the
supposed
office
of
the
tympanum
is
to
transmit
the
vibrations
made
on
the
membrana
tympani
to
the
internal
ear
this
is
effected
by
the
air
which
it
contains
and
by
the
chain
of
small
bones
that
are
enclosed
in
this
cavity
the
use
of
the
eustachian
tube
is
to
admit
air
into
the
tympanum
which
renders
the
pressure
on
both
sides
equal

thus
its

the

no
acute

requires
perfection
in
the
structure

and
that
portion

from
which
the

proceeds
deafness
is
by
no
means
unfrequent
we
will
now
advert
to
some
of
the
common
causes
of
imperfect
hearing
the
structure
or
functional
action
of
the
brain
may
be
deranged
by
inflammation
by
compression
or
by
debility
and
produce
deafness
the
first
is
seen
during
inflammatory
affections
of
the
brain
and
in
fevers
the
second
is
seen
in
accidental
injuries
of
the
head
the
third
is
seen
in
old
age
and
after
severe
diseases
of
the
head
and
fevers
in
these
cases
applications
to
and
operations
upon
the
ear
do
no
good
the
only
remedy
is
to
remove
if
possible
the
diseased
condition
of
the
brain
imperfect
hearing
may
be
produced
by
the
destruction
of
the
membrana
tympani
or
removal
of
the
bones
of
the
ear
or
the
parts
within
the
labyrinth
in
these
instances
medical
treatment
is
of
no
avail
as
the
destroyed
parts
can
not
be
restored
hearing
may
be
rendered
defective
by
a
diminution
of
the
vibratory
character
of
the
membrana
tympani
this
may
result
from
a
thickening
of
this
membrane
or
from
an
accumulation
of
wax
upon
its
outer
surface
the
increased
thickness
is
usually
the
result
of
inflammation
either
acute
or
chronic
the
proper
treatment
is
such
as
is
efficient
to
remove
inflammatory
action
the
introduction
of
heads
of
pins
into
the
ear
is
a
frequent
cause
of
chronic
inflammation
of
the
membrana
tympani
hence
this
practice
should
never
be
adopted
and
if
acquired
should
be
abandoned

this
may
be
repeated
for

successive
days

may
be
impaired
by

of
the
eustachian
tube
the
closure
of
this
canal
diminishes
the
vibratory
character
of
the
air
within

in
the

manner
as
closing

the
treatment
of

to
have

in

it
is
proper
to

should
cease

of
maintaining

of
the

what
is
important
in

stages
of

what
is
proper
in
all
instances
of
acute
disease
how
can
it
be
effected
select
a

for
a

that
is
exposed
to
as
little
external
noise
as
possible

made
on
the
organ
of
hearing
greatly
influence
the
nervous
system
likewise
select
a
spacious
apartment
that
has
no
superfluous
furniture
the
practice
of
placing
a
sick
person
in
a
small
when
a
more
spacious
room
can
be
used
is
poor
economy
not
to
say
unkind
care
is
necessary
in
regulating
the
light
of
a
while
a
strong
light
would
produce
an
increased
action
of
the
vessels
of
the
brain
a
moderate
light
would
be
an
appropriate
stimulus
to
this
organ
it
is
seldom
or
never
necessary
to
exclude
all
light
from
the
a
sick
person
whether
a
child
or
an
adult
should
not
be
disturbed
by
visitors
even
if
their
calls
are
short
the
excitement
of
meeting
them
is
followed
by
a
depression
of
the
nervous
system
the
more
dangerous
and
apparently
nearer
death
the
sick
person
is
the
more
rigorous
should
be
the
observance
of
this
suggestion
nor
should
the
be
opened
to
privileged
classes
for
the
excitement
caused
by
a
visit
from
relations
and
the
virtuous
will
do
as
much
injury
to
the

as
that
produced
by
strangers
and
the
vicious
the
custom
of
visiting
and
conversing
with
sick
friends
during
the
intervals
of
daily
labor
and
particularly
on
is
a
great
evil
no
person
will
thus
intrude
herself
in
the
who
cares
more
for
the
welfare
of
the

than
for
the
gratification
of

inquiries
can
be
made
of
the

respecting

what

to
the

admitted

effect

what
is
said
of
the
custom
of
calling

conversing
with
the

during
the
intervals
of
daily
labor
while
attending
a
miss
of
sick
of
fever
i
pronounced
her
better
withdrew
medicine
directed
a
simple
low
diet
and
the
exclusion
of
all
visitors
in
the
evening
i
was
sent
for
to
attend
her
there
was
a
violent
relapse
into
the
disease
which
continued
to
increase
in
severity
until
the
fourth
day
when
death
terminated
her
sufferings
i
learned
that
soon
after
i
gave
directions
that
no
visitors
be
admitted
into
her
room
several
friends
were
permitted
to
enter
the
chamber
and
talk
with
the
sick
girl
their
conversation
produced
a
severe
headache
and
to
use
the
language
of
the
patient
it
seemed
as
if
their
talk
would
kill
me
and
did
kill
no
should
be
taken
in
the
first
stages
of
disease
even
if
the
affection
is
slight
the
thirst
can
be
allayed
by
drinking
cold
water
and
other
preparations
of
an
unstimulating
character
it
is
wrong
to
tempt
the
appetite
of
a
person
who
is
indisposed
the
cessation
of
a
desire
for
food
is
the
warning
of
nature
that
the
system
is
in
such
a
state
that
it
can
not
be
digested
when
a
patient
is
recovering
from
illness
the
food
should
be
simple
and
in
quantities
not
so
great
as
to
oppress
the
stomach
it
should
also
be
given
with
regularity
eat
little
and
often
with
no
regard
to
regularity
is
a
pernicious
practice
when
a
physician
attends
a
sick
person
he
should
have
the
management
of
the
food
particularly
after
the
medicine
has
been
withdrawn
and
the
patient
is
convalescent
the
prevailing
idea
that
person
may
safely
advise
relative
to
food
or
that
the
appetite
of
the
convalescing
person
is
a
competent
guide
is
dangerous
and
can
not
be
too
much
censured
give
an
illustration
what
suggestion
relative
to
food
in
the
first
stages
of
disease
how
can
the
thirst
be
allayed
when
the
patient
is
convalescent
how
should
the
food
be
given
what
is
said
of
the
practice
of
eating
little
and
often
who
should
have
the
special
management
of
food
when
medicine
is
withdrawn
what
idea
prevails
in
the
community
in
i
attended
a
miss
sick
of

after
an
illness
of
a
few
days
the
fever
abated

called
me
from
the
town
two
days
during
my
absence
a
sympathizing
officious
matron
called
found
her
weak
but
improving
and
told
her
she
needed
food
to
strengthen
her
and
that
it
would
now
do
her
good
accordingly
eggs
and
a
piece
of
beefsteak
were
prepared
and
given
to
the
convalescent
girl
she
ate
heartily
and
the
result
was
a
relapse
into
a
fever
more
violent
than
the
first
attack
it
is
very
important
in
disease
that

kept
a

of
the

of
this

of
the
body
exerts
a
great
influence
in
removing
disease
from
the
internal
organs
as
well
as
keeping
them
in

if
the
twenty
or
thirty
ounces
of
waste
hurtful
matter
that
passes
through
the
pores
of
the
skin
in
hours
are
not

this
was
accompanied
with
a
dry
inactive
condition
of
the

medicine
had
no
salutary
effect
in
relieving
her
cough
she
was
induced
by
the
advice
of
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
to
enter
upon
a
systematic
course
of
bathing
twice
every
day
soon
the
skin
became
soft
its
proper
functions
were
restored
the

disappeared
every

its
injurious
influences

was
called
in
consultation
with
another
physician
to
who
was
much
debilitated
and
delirious
for
several
successive
days
he
had
not
slept
his
room
was
kept
very
warm
and
close
for
fear
he
would
take
cold
the
only
change
that
i
made
in
the
treatment
was
to
open
the
door
and
window
at
a
distance
from
the
bed
in
a
short
time
the
delirium
ceased
and
he
fell
into
a
quiet
slumber
from
this
time
he
rapidly
recovered
and
the
delirium
was
probably
the
result
of
breathing
impure
air

precaution
was
used
to
prevent
persons

breathing
fresh
air

her
friends
supposing
that
life
was
extinct
caused
her
body
to
be
removed
from
the
house
to

open
shed

pure
air
revived

vital
spark

result
probably
would
have
been
different
had
she
been
kept
a

the
influence

in

medicine

sometimes

the

it

directions
for
nurses
the
nurse
requires
knowledge
and
practice
to
enable
her
to
discharge
aright
her
duty
to
the
patient
as
much
as
the
physician
and
surgeon
do
to
perform
what
is
incumbent
on
them
woman
from
her
constitution
and
habits
is
the
natural
nurse
of
the
sick
and
in
general
no
small
portion
of
her
time
is
spent
in
ministering
at
the
couch
of
disease
and
suffering
as
the
young
and
vigorous
as
well
as
the
aged
and
the
infirm
are
liable
to
be
laid
upon
the
bed
of
sickness
by
an
epidemic
or
imprudent
exposure
or
by
some
accident
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
the
girl
as
well
as
the
matron
may
know
how
she
can
render
services
in
an
efficient
and
proper
manner
no
should
consider
her
education
complete
who
is
not
acquainted
with
the
principles
of
the
duties
of
a
general
nurse
and
a
temporary
watcher
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
while
we
have
medical
schools
and
colleges
to
educate
physicians
there
is
no
institution
to
educate
in
their
equally
responsible
station
in
the
absence
of
such
institutions
the
defect
can
be
remedied
to
some
extent
by
teaching
every
girl
or
laws
of
to
make
such
knowledge
more
available
and
complete
attention
is
invited
to
the
following
suggestions
relative
to
the
practical
duties
of
a
nurse
does
the
nurse
require
knowledge
and
practice
in
her
employment
as
well
as
the
physician
who
is
the
natural
nurse
of
the
sick
what
then
is
incumbent
on
every
girl
should
there
be
schools
to
educate
nurses
as
well
as
physicians
and
surgeons
bathing
the
nurse
before
commencing
to
bathe
the
patient
should
provide
herself
with
water
two
towels
a
sponge
a
piece
of
soft
flannel
and
a
sheet
the
temperature
of
the
room
should
also
be
observed
when
the
patient
is
feeble
use
or
warm
water
cold
water
should
only
be
used
when
the
system
has
vigor
enough
to
produce
reaction
upon
the
skin
this
is
shown
by
the
increased
redness
of
the
skin
and
a
feeling
of
warmth
and
comfort
after
a
proper
amount
of
friction
before
using
the
sponge
to
bathe
a
sheet
or
fold
of
cloth
should
be
spread
smoothly
over
the
bed
and
under
the
patient
to
prevent
the
on
which
the
patient
lies
from
becoming
damp
or
wet
apply
the
wet
sponge
to
one
part
of
the
body
at
a
time
as
the
arm
for
instance
by
doing
so
the
liability
of
contracting
chills
is
diminished
take
a
dry
soft
towel
wipe
the
bathed
part
and
follow
this
by
vigorous
rubbing
with
a
crash
towel
or
what
is
better
a
mitten
made
of
this
material
then
use
briskly
a
piece
of
soft
flannel
to
remove
all
moisture
that
may
exist
on
the
skin
and
particularly
between
the
fingers
and
the
flections
of
the
joints
in
this
manner
bathe
the
entire
body
the
sick
should
be
thoroughly
bathed
at
least
twice
in
hours
particular
attention
should
be
given
to
the
parts
between
the
fingers
and
toes
and
about
the
flections
of
the
joints
as
the
accumulation
of
the
excretions
is
most
abundant
on
these
parts
in
bathing
these
portions
of
the
system
are
very
generally
neglected
the
best
time
for
bathing
is
when
the
patient
feels
most
vigorous
and
freest
from
exhaustion
the
practice
of
daubing
the
face
and
hands
with
a
towel
dipped
in
hot
rum
camphor
and
vinegar
does
not
remove
the
impurities
but
causes
the
skin
soon
to
feel
dry
hard
and
uncomfortable
what
should
a
nurse
provide
herself
with
before
bathing
a
patient
when
should
cold
water
be
used
how
should
the
bathing
then
be
performed
so
that
the
patient
may
not
contract
a
cold
how
often
should
a
sick
person
be
bathed

daubing
the
face
and

it
is
the
duty
of
every
woman
to
know
how

make
the
simple
preparations

diet
in
the
most
wholesome
and
the
most

way
which
is

frequently
so
as
to
cause
the

to
loathe

for
the
sick
in
the
neatest
and
most
careful
manner
directions
for
making
the
simple
preparations
for
the
sick
are
found
in
almost
every
when
the
physician
enjoins
abstinence
from
food
the
nurse
should
strictly
obey
the
injunction
she
should
be
as
particular
to
know

in
knowing
how
and
when
to
give
the
prescribed
medicines
and
obey
them
as
implicitly
when
a
patient
is
convalescent
the
desire
for
food
is
generally
strong
and
it
often
requires
firmness
and
patience
together
with
great
care
on
the
part
of
the
nurse
that
the
food
is
prepared
suitably
and
given
at
proper
times
the
physician
should
direct
how
frequently
it
should
be
taken

it
is
the
duty
of
the
nurse
to
see
that
not
only
the
room
is
well
ventilated
in
the
morning
but
that
fresh
air
is
constantly
admitted
during
the
day
great
care
must
be
taken
however
that
the
patient
does
not
feel
the
current
as
well
as
that
of
the
body
should
be
aired
every
day
and
oftener
changed
in
sickness
than
in
health
all
clothing
when
changed
should
be
well
dried
and
warmed
by
a
fire
previous
to
its
being
put
on
the
patient
or
the
bed
should
every
woman
know
how
to
make

be
relied
on
as
an
index
of

it
is
the
duty
of

physician
to
impart
it
to
the

the

there
is

of
contracting

to
the

laws
of
health
and
remains
not
more
than
six
hours
at
a
time
in
the
directions
for

these
necessary
assistants

have
knowledge
and
practice
they
should
ever
be
cheerful
kind
firm
and
attentive
in
the
presence
of

a

supper
should
be
eaten

a

care
of
the

in
preference
to

particularly
if
the
disease
is
of
a
contagious
character
experiments
have
shown
that
black
and
other
dark
colors
will
absorb
more
readily
the
subtile
effluvia
that
emanate
from
sick
persons
than
white
or
light
colors
whatever
may
be
wanted
during

night
should
be
brought
into

before
the
family
retires
for
sleep
in
order
that
the
slumbers
of
the
patient
be
not
disturbed
by
haste
or
searching
for
needed
articles
the
same
general
directions
should
be
observed
by
watchers
as
are
given
to
the
nurse
nor
should
the
watcher
deem
it
necessary
to
make
herself
acceptable
to
the
patient
by
exhausting
conversation
it
can
hardly
be
expected
that
the
farmer
who
has
been
laboring
hard
in
the
field
or
the
mechanic
who
has
toiled
during
the
day
is
qualified
to
render
all
those
little
attentions
that
a
sick
person
requires
hence
would
it
not
be
more
benevolent
and
economical
to
employ
and

who
are
qualified
by
knowledge

to
perform
this
duty
in

the

the
latin
signifying
twelve
since
the

of
which
this
is
the
name
is
usually
about
twelve
fingers
breadth
in
length
the
is
also
from
the
latin
empty
since
it
is
usually
found
in
that
condition
after
death
as
the
food
seems
to
pass
rapidly
through
this
part
of
the
intestine
the
term
is
from
the
greek
signifying
to
twist
since
it
always
appears
in
a
contorted
condition
the
name
is
derived
from
the
fact
of
its
being
a
blind
or
short
sack
perforated
by
the
extremity
of
the
ileum
the
name
of
the
next
division
of
the
intestine
is
from
the
greek
to
prohibit
as
the
contents
of
the
alimentary
canal
pass
slowly
through
this
portion
the
is
named
from
the
straight
direction
that
it
assumes
in
the
latter
part
of
its
course
the
food
is
forced
through
the
alimentary
canal
by
contractions
of
its
muscular
coat
produced
by
the
nervous
filaments
of
the
sympathetic
system
not
being
at
all
dependent
on
the
centre
this
is
called
the
peristaltic
or
vermicular
motion
the
great
length
of
intestine
in
all
animals
and
especially
in
the
herbivorous
ones
is
owing
to
the
necessity
of
exposing
the
food
to
a
large
number
of
the
lacteals
that
the
nourishment
may
all
be
taken
from
it
the
different
processes
through
which
the
food
passes
before
assimilation
are
of
considerable
interest
the
mastication
and
mixture
of
the
saliva
with
the
food
are
purely
of
a
mechanical
nature
when
any
solid
or
fluid
substance
is
placed
upon
the
tongue
or
in
contact
with
the
inner
surface
of
the
cheeks
by
an
involuntary
act
the
salivary
glands
are
stimulated
to
activity
and
commence
pouring
the
saliva
into
the
mouth
through
the
salivary
ducts
as
soon
as
mastication
commences
the
contraction
of
the
masseter
and
other
muscles
employed
in
mastication
stimulates
the
salivary
glands
to
increased
action
and
a
still
greater
quantity
of
saliva
is
secreted
and
forced
upon
the
food
which
is
constantly
being
ground
to
a
finer
condition
until
it
is
sufficiently
reduced
for
deglutition
whether
the
salivary
fluid
acts
any
other
part
than
simply
that
of
a
demulcent
to
assist
the
gastric
juice
in
still
further
dissolving
the
food
is
yet
a
matter
of
some
doubt
although
it
is
found
that
no
other
liquid
will
equally
well
subserve
the
process
of
digestion
and
promote
health
after
the
food
is
in
the
condition
ready
to
be
swallowed
by
an
apparently
involuntary
motion
it
is
placed
upon
the
back
of
the
tongue
which
carries
it
backwards
to
the
top
of
the
pharynx
where
the
constrictions
of
the
pharynx
aided
by
the
muscles
of
the
tongue
and
floor
of
the
mouth
with
a
sudden
and
violent
movement
thrust
it
beyond
the
epiglottis
in
order
to
allow
the
least
necessary
time
to
the
closure
of
the
glottis
after
which
by
the
compression
of
the
oesophagus
it
is
forced
into
the
stomach
here
it
is
that
the
true
business
of
digestion
commences
for
as
soon
as
any
substance
except
water
enters
the
stomach
this
organ
with
involuntary
movements
that
seem
almost
like
instinct
commences
the
secretion
of
the
gastric
juice
and
by
contractions
of
its
muscular
coat
succeeds
in
effecting
a
most
perfect
mixture
of
the
food
with
this
juice
by
which
the
contents
of
the
stomach
are
reduced
to
the
softest
pulp
the
gastric
juice
in
its
pure
state
is
a
colorless
transparent
fluid
inodorous
a
little
saltish
and
perceptibly
acid
it
possesses
the
property
of
coagulating
albumen
and
separating
the
whey
of
milk
from
its
curd
and
afterwards
completely
dissolving
the
curd
its
taste
when
applied
to
the
tongue
is
similar
to
that
of
mucilaginous
water
slightly
acidulated
with
muriatic
acid
the
organs
of
its
secretion
are
an
immense
number
of
tubes
or
glands
of
a
diameter
varying
from
one
five
hundredth
to
one
three
hundredth
of
an
inch
situated
in
the
mucous
coat
of
the
stomach
and
receiving
their
blood
from
the
gastric
arteries
a
chemical
analysis
shows
it
to
consist
of
water
mucilage
and
the
several
free
acids
muriatic
acetic
lactic
and
butyric
together
with
a
peculiar
organic
matter
called
which
acts
after
the
manner
of
ferments
between
the
temperature
of
and
the
true
process
of
digestion
is
probably
owing
to
the
action
of
pepsin
and
the
acids
especially
if
the
presence
of
the
or
muriatic
be
admitted
since
we
know
by
experiments
out
of
the
body
that
chlorine
one
of
its
elements
is
a
powerful
solvent
of
all
organic
substances
the
antiseptic
properties
of
the
gastric
juice
as
discovered
by
experiments
made
on
alexis
martin
doubtless
have
much
influence
on
digestion
although
their
true
uses
are
probably
not
yet
known
as
soon
as
the
food
is
reduced
to
a
state
of
fluidity
the
pyloric
orifice
of
the
stomach
is
unclosed
and
it
is
thrust
onwards
through
the
alimentary
canal
receiving
in
the
duodenum
the
secretions
of
the
liver
and
pancreas
after
which
it
yields
to
the
lacteals
its
nutrient
portion
and
the
residuum
is
expelled
from
the
body
there
have
been
many
hypotheses
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
digestive
process
some
have
supposed
that
digestion
is
a
mere
mechanical
process
produced
by
the
motion
of
the
walls
of
the
stomach
while
others
in
later
times
have
considered
it
as
under
the
influence
of
a
spirit
separate
from
the
individual
who
took
up
his
residence
in
the
stomach
and
regulated
the
whole
affair
while
others
still
would
make
it
out
to
be
a
chemical
operation
and
thus
constitute
the
stomach
a
sort
of
laboratory
but
to
all
these
ridiculous
hypotheses
sir
john
hunter
has
applied
the
following
playful
language
some
will
have
it
that
the
stomach
is
a
mill
others
that
it
is
a
fermenting
vat
and
others
that
it
is
a
stewpan
but
in
my
view
of
the
matter
it
is
neither
a
mill
a
fermenting
vat
nor
a
stewpan
but
a
stomach
at
the
present
day
this
process
is
regarded
as
a
complex
and
not
a
simple
operation
it
seems
to
be
a
process
in
which
the
mechanical
chemical
and
vital
agencies
must
all
act
in
harmony
and
order
for
if
one
of
these
be
withdrawn
the
function
can
not
be
sustained
for
any
considerable
length
of
time
and
of
the
chemical
and
mechanical
parts
of
the
process
since
the
former
is
much
more
important
and
as
a
matter
of
course
the
vital
powers
are
indispensable
therefore
digestion
may
be
considered
as
a
chemical
operation
directly
dependent
on
the
laws
of
vitality
or
of
life
since
the
proper
consistency
of
the
food
depends
in
a
great
measure
upon
the
character
of
the
solvents
while
the
secretion
of
these
fluids
their
proper
amount
together
with
the
peculiar
instinct
as
it
almost
seems
to
be
necessary
to
direct
the
stomach
in
its
many
functions
are
exclusively
and
entirely
dependent
on
the
laws
and
conditions
of
life
as
food
is
necessary
to
supply
the
waste
and
promote
the
growth
of
the
body
it
follows
that
that
will
be
the
best
adapted
to
the
system
which
contains
the
same
chemical
elements
of
which
the
body
is
composed
oxygen
hydrogen
carbon
and
nitrogen
these
elements
are
found
in
greater
or
less
quantity
in
all
animal
food
and
in
many
vegetable
products
hence
that
article
of
food
which
contains
all
these
elements
in
a
proper
proportion
will
tend
much
more
to
the
growth
and
strength
of
the
body
than
those
kinds
which
are
deficient
in
one
or
more
of
them
much
experience
on
this
point
and
scientific
research
seem
to
show
that
a
reasonable
amount
of
animal
food
in
health
tends
to
give
greater
strength
of
muscle
and
a
more
general
sense
of
fulness
than
in
ordinary
cases
a
vegetable
diet
is
able
to
do
owing
to
the
presence
of
nitrogen
in
animal
tissues
yet
there
are
examples
of
the
healthiest
and
strongest
men
who
live
years
without
a
morsel
of
animal
food
and
the
fact
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
supposing
that
the
system
has
the
power
to
make
the
most
economical
use
of
the
little
nitrogen
offered
to
it
in
the
food
or
else
that
it
has
by
some
means
the
power
to
abstract
it
from
the
atmosphere
and
transform
it
to
the
living
animal
substance
the
proximate
principles
which
are
the
most
important
in
nourishing
the
body
are
albumen
and
fibrin
these
constitute
the
greater
part
of
all
the
softer
animal
tissues
and
are
also
found
in
certain
classes
of
vegetables
such
as
peas
beans
lentils
and
many
seeds
hence
in
many
cases
a
vegetable
diet
especially
if
embracing
any
of
those
articles
would
be
sufficient
to
sustain
life
even
if
no
animal
food
should
be
eaten
but
no
animal
can
exist
for
a
long
time
if
permitted
only
to
eat
substances
destitute
of
nitrogen
as
in
the
case
of
a
dog
fed
entirely
on
sugar
which
lived
but
thirty
days
and
owing
to
this
fact
baron
liebig
proposes
to
call
substances
used
for
food
containing
nitrogen
elements
of
nutrition
and
those
containing
an
excess
of
carbon
elements
of
respiration
since
according
to
his
view
the
food
is
necessary
to
support
the
growth
of
the
body
by
replacing
the
effete
and
particles
with
new
matter
and
also
to
keep
up
the
supply
of
fuel
in
order
to
promote
a
sufficient
degree
of
heat
in
the
system
accordingly
under
the
first
division
would
be
included
all
lean
meats
and
vegetables
such
as
peas
while
the
fat
of
animals
vegetable
oils
sugars
tubers
as
the
potato
and
all
other
substances
containing
starch
would
be
included
under
the
latter
division
i
this
definition
of
exhalants
is
from
the
theory
of
haller
and
others
it
is
now
believed
that
the
fluids
exude
through
the
thin
coats
of
the
blood
vessels
this
process
is
called
and
is
the
of
old
physiologists
j
it
is
a
fact
in
animal
and
vegetable
physiology
that
membranes
possess
the
property
of
allowing
fluids
and
gases
to
pass
through
them
in
either
direction
and
also
to
permit
two
fluids
to
pass
in
opposite
directions
at
the
same
time
this
property
is
designated
when
a
fluid
passes
from
without
a
body
inward
and
when
the
reverse
takes
place
the
first
is
called
one
of
the
most
striking
instances
of
this
in
the
human
system
is
shown
in
the
lungs
where
carbonic
acid
and
water
pass
out
through
the
mucous
membrane
of
the
bronchial
tubes
and
and
the
oxygen
of
the
air
enters
the
blood
through
the
same
membrane
by
this
process
of
imbibition
the
oxygenation
of
the
blood
is
much
more
readily
and
faithfully
accomplished
inasmuch
as
by
the
immense
number
of
bronchial
tubes
and
a
larger
quantity
of
blood
is
exposed
to
a
greater
portion
of
air
than
if
the
blood
were
directly
laid
open
to
the
atmosphere
in
a
mass
or
the
air
were
immediately
transmitted
through
it
since
the
function
of
respiration
is
to
free
the
system
of
superfluous
carbon
and
hydrogen
by
union
with
the
oxygen
of
the
air
it
follows
that
the
greater
the
amount
of
the
products
to
be
expelled
the
larger
the
quantity
of
oxygen
will
be
required
to
effect
this
purpose
as
we
find
to
be
the
case
with
those
who
consume
large
quantities
of
food
the
quantity
of
oxygen
daily
consumed
through
the
lungs
by
an
adult
is
about
and
the
carbon
in
the
food
oz
but
in
order
to
convert
this
whole
amount
of
carbon
into
carbonic
acid
which
passes
off
through
the
lungs
and
skin
oz
of
oxygen
are
required
the
remaining
oz
being
absorbed
by
the
skin
if
the
supply
of
food
remain
the
same
while
the
amount
of
oxygen
in
the
inspired
air
is
diminished
the
superfluous
carbon
will
induce
disease
in
the
system
as
is
the
case
of
those
persons
who
are
limited
in
their
supply
of
air
of
a
proper
quality
or
quantity
and
consequently
have
less
appetite
for
food
than
those
who
are
abundantly
supplied
with
air
of
the
proper
standard
of
health
and
in
children
who
proportionally
consume
more
food
than
adults
and
who
are
more
active
thereby
causing
a
more
rapid
circulation
of
blood
and
consequently
the
removal
of
more
superfluous
particles
of
matter
in
children
we
notice
the
need
of
air
by
their
disposition
to
be
much
in
the
open
air
and
often
inspiring
more
deeply
than
is
common
in
older
persons
also
if
the
carbon
of
the
food
does
not
have
a
requisite
supply
of
oxygen
from
the
air
or
other
sources
the
body
becomes
emaciated
although
nourishing
food
may
be
used
and
on
the
other
hand
if
there
be
a
diminished
supply
of
food
but
an
abundance
of
atmospheric
air
leanness
and
emaciation
are
sure
to
follow
owing
to
the
fact
that
if
the
oxygen
has
no
waste
carbon
from
the
body
to
unite
with
it
combines
with
the
fat
and
some
other
soft
portions
of
the
body
which
the
author
of
nature
seems
to
have
provided
for
this
very
purpose
as
is
seen
in
the
case
of
hibernating
animals
who
enter
their
places
of
winter
abode
sleek
and
fat
but
crawl
out
in
the
spring
not
merely
deprived
of
their
fatty
matter
but
also
with
great
diminution
of
all
the
softer
parts
which
have
given
up
their
share
of
carbon
to
supply
animal
heat
one
important
cause
of
emaciation
in
febrile
diseases
is
the
greater
rapidity
of
the
pulse
and
respiration
which
consume
more
carbon
than
is
afforded
by
the
scanty
supply
of
food
that
is
taken
although
profuse
perspiration
which
almost
always
occurs
in
some
stages
of
fevers
greatly
diminishes
the
full
state
of
the
body
the
theory
of
baron
liebig
concerning
the
change
which
the
blood
experiences
in
color
in
its
passage
through
the
lungs
meets
with
the
approbation
of
many
physiologists
although
there
are
some
important
difficulties
in
the
way
of
fully
receiving
it
a
chemical
analysis
of
the
blood
shows
it
to
be
composed
of
albumen
and
fibrin
together
with
some
other
substances
in
small
proportions
and
always
perceptible
traces
of
iron
he
attributes
the
change
in
color
to
the
iron
as
this
substance
enters
into
combination
with
carbon
and
oxygen
for
as
the
blood
passes
through
the
trunks
of
the
larger
vessels
and
capillaries
it
receives
the
carbon
from
the
tissues
which
are
continually
transformed
and
taking
up
the
oxygen
from
the
arterialized
blood
forms
carbonic
acid
which
unites
with
the
iron
forming
of
iron
this
being
of
a
gray
color
he
supposes
it
to
be
that
which
with
the
other
impurities
of
the
blood
gives
the
venous
blood
the
dark
blue
color
then
as
the
blood
comes
in
contact
with
the
oxygen
as
it
is
returned
and
exposed
to
this
element
in
the
lungs
the
carbonic
acid
leaves
the
iron
which
has
a
stronger
affinity
for
oxygen
than
for
carbonic
acid
and
forms
the
scarlet
red
peroxide
of
iron
that
gives
the
characteristic
color
to
the
arterial
blood
after
this
as
the
blood
is
sent
out
through
the
smaller
arteries
and
capillaries
it
again
gathers
carbon
and
other
impurities
from
the
system
and
becomes
the
dark
venous
blood
thus
completing
the
whole
change
of
color
in
the
circulation
as
already
mentioned
different
articles
of
food
have
been
divided
into
the
azotized
and
or
those
which
contain
nitrogen
as
one
of
their
constituents
and
those
which
are
nearly
destitute
of
it
of
these
according
to
liebig
the
azotized
portions
are
simply
to
supply
the
waste
that
is
continually
going
on
in

carefully
examine

enable
the

to
recite
and
the

to
conduct
his

from
the
latter
let
a
pupil
show
the
situation
of
an
organ

part
on
an
anatomical

and
also
give
its
structure
while
other
members
of
the

note
all
omissions
and
misstatements
another
pupil
may
give
the
use
of
that
organ
and
if
necessary
others
may
give
an
extended
explanation
the
third
may
explain
the
laws
on
which
the
health
of
the

depends
while
other
members
of

supply

has
been

thus
presenting

questions
may

occur

let

be

confine
