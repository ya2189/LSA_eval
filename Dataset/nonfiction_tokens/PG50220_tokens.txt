introduction
in
the
following
pages
is
presented
a
number
of
the
more
timely
papers
and
addresses
of
the
year
on
the
present
railway
situation
together
with
chapters
from
two
books
of
current
interest
on
the
same
subject
as
the
object
of
the
compilation
has
been
to
present
in
permanent
and
accessible
form
information
in
regard
to
american
railways
worthy
of
more
than
the
ephemeral
life
of
newspaper
or
pamphlet
publication
it
has
been
thought
well
to
accompany
the
messages
of
today
with
a
brief
glance
at
the
conditions
on
this
continent
before
the
days
of
railways
happily
for
this
purpose
the
first
two
chapters
of
cleveland
and
powell
railroad
promotion
and
capitalization
in
the
united
states
fresh
from
the
press
afforded
the
very
background
needed
and
the
first
report
of
the
engineer
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
provided
the
glasses
through
which
the
reader
can
look
forward
from
the
small
beginnings
to
what
is
now
known
as
the
greatest
railway
system
on
the
globe
after
this
study
of
conditions
as
they
were
and
of
the
opportunities
that
invited
the
railway
pioneers
of
it
is
instructive
to
read
the
utterances
of
the
latest
of
our
empire
builders
whose
foresight
and
indomitable
will
anticipated
the
development
of
our
pacific
northwest
with
railway
facilities
that
already
lag
behind
the
necessities
of
its
amazing
growth
of
the
other
addresses
and
papers
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
more
than
that
they
reflect
the
prevailing
sentiments
of
all
thoughtful
railway
officials
respecting
conditions
of
the
gravest
import
to
the
great
industry
upon
which
the
entire
fabric
of
our
national
prosperity
and
depends
only
the
shallowest
student
of
our
social
economic
and
political
system
can
view
the
persistent
attacks
upon
the
american
system
of
transportation
without
serious
alarm
for
the
results
this
alarm
is
the
prevailing
note
of
these
papers
and
it
comes
from
men
who
are
at
the
helm
and
who
see
the
financial
breakers
upon
which
the
fierce
blasts
of
political
exigency
are
driving
the
railways
the
papers
by
sir
george
gibbs
and
acworth
the
leading
authorities
on
british
railways
discuss
the
alternative
to
wisely
regulated
railways
nationalization
of
railways
with
a
continuance
of
unwise
and
burdensome
regulation
of
railways
which
strips
responsibility
of
all
discretion
nationalization
is
inevitable
the
bureau
statistics
of
american
railways
for
the
year
ending
june
is
included
in
the
railway
library
because
it
affords
the
latest
data
not
only
as
to
the
railways
of
the
united
states
but
for
the
world
acknowledgments
are
made
to
the
authors
and
publishers
of
the
various
papers
and
especially
to
the
publishers
of
the
two
works
from
which
important
chapters
have
been
extracted
by
their
courteous
permission
as
well
as
that
of
their
authors
if
this
publication
fulfils
the
purpose
of
its
compilation
it
will
be
succeeded
by
annual
volumes
of
like

the
same

by

of
the

inland
transportation
as
we
know
it
is
the
product
of
the
last
century
it
had
its
beginning
in
the
industrial
revolution
in
england
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
manor
as
a
productive
agency
had
been
supplanted
by
a
system
of
domestic
production
and
this
in
turn
was
giving
place
to
the
factory
the
combined
influences
of
increasing
capital
and
invention
had
operated
to
centralize
the
industrial
population
in
the
towns
ocean
commerce
was
comparatively
well
developed
and
manufacture
was
fast
being
established
upon
a
modern
basis
but
inland
transportation
was
still
encumbered
by
such
primitive
methods
as
to
make
difficult
the
utilization
of
the
resources
of
the
interior
a
century
and
a
half
before
lord
bacon
had
called
attention
to
the
three
great
elements
necessary
to
make
a
nation
great
and
prosperous
a
fertile
soil
busy
workshops
and
easy
conveyance
of
men
and
things
from
one
place
to
another
but
the
significance
of
this
reflection
was
not
appreciated
until
after
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
controlling
force
of
custom
social
inertia
had
stood
in
the
way
of
progress
in
england
until
about
the
opening
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
principal
manufacturing
towns
of
great
britain
were
situated
on
or
near
the
coast
for
in
the
inland
country
goods
were
still
carried
on
the
backs
of
men
or
hauled
in
carts
over
heavy
roads
said
lardner
the
internal
transport
of
goods
in
england
was
performed
by
wagon
and
was
not
only
intolerably
slow
but
so
expensive
as
to
exclude
every
object
except
manufactured
articles
and
such
as
being
of
light
weight
and
small
bulk
in
proportion
to
their
value
would
allow
of
a
high
rate
of
transport
thus
the
charge
for
carriage
by
wagon
from
london
to
leeds
was
at
the
rate
of
a
ton
being
cents
per
ton
per
mile
between
liverpool
and
manchester
it
was
a
ton
or
cents
per
ton
per
mile
heavy
articles
such
as
coal
and
other
materials
could
only
be
available
for
commerce
where
their
position
favored
transport
by
sea
and
consequently
many
of
the
richest
districts
of
the
kingdom
remained
unproductive
awaiting
the
tardy
advancement
of
the
art
of
transport
in
america
before
the
revolution
the
american
colonists
lived
in
almost
complete
isolation
travel
by
land
was
limited
for
water
communication
presented
fewer
obstacles
to
progress
population
was
arranged
along
the
seaboard
or
in
isolated
groups
a
short
distance
inland
living
narrow
lives
each
community
developed
a
distinct
dialect
and
characteristic
customs
and
dress
social
activities
were
limited
to
going
to
mill
market
and
church
or
exchanging
friendly
calls
traveling
on
foot
or
on
horseback
along
wooded
trails
even
between
seacoast
towns
there
was
little
interchange
of
products
or
population
and
a
citizen
of
one
colony
going
to
another
was
at
once
struck
with
the
many
local
peculiarities
it
was
less
than
twenty
years
before
the
revolutionary
war
when
the
first
stage
line
was
opened
between
new
york
and
philadelphia
and
three
days
were
then
required
for
a
single
trip
it
was
ten
years
later
when
the
first
stage
line
was
established
between
philadelphia
and
baltimore
methods
of
travel
and
transport
between
towns
of
considerable
size
there
were
country
roads
over
which
vehicles
could
pass
when
the
weather
would
permit
the
stage
coach
which
was
the
only
public
land
conveyance
plied
along
the
coast
and
between
a
few
inland
centers
but
the
coaches
of
that
day
were
rude
boxes
swung
on
wheels
by
leathern
straps
instead
of
springs
with
seats
for
a
dozen
or
more
and
accommodations
for
a
limited
amount
of
baggage
the
rate
of
travel
was
from
two
to
six
miles
an
hour
according
to
the
condition
of
the
roads
and
the
importance
of
the
route
on
the
farm
the
or
stone
sledge
was
in
common
use
and
at
times
it
was
even
employed
to
carry
produce
to
local
markets
in
more
progressive
communities
carts
and
wagons
were
to
be
found
the
best
of
roads
however
were
nothing
but
mud
roads
and
the
wagons
commonly
of
the
linchpin
type
were
clumsy
and
awkward
some
of
the
more
primitive
wagons
had
wheels
made
of
cross
sections
of
trees
trimmed
and
centered
to
roll
on
axles
of
wood
those
who
traveled
had
little
thought
of
time
companionship
found
expression
in
gossip
and
tippling
and
an
emergency
which
required
all
to
get
out
and
take
a
wheel
only
added
spice
to
the
trip
we
have
the
following
description
of
the
roads
about
philadelphia
the
metropolis
and
commercial
center
of
the
new
world
on
the
best
lines
of
communication
the
ruts
were
deep
the
descents
precipitous
near
the
great
cities
the
state
of
the
roads
was
so
bad
as
to
render
all
approach
difficult
and
dangerous
out
of
philadelphia
a
quagmire
of
black
mud
covered
a
long
stretch
of
road
near
the
village
of
rising
sun
there
horses
were
often
seen
floundering
in
the
mud
up
to
their
bellies
on
the
york
road
long
lines
of
wagons
were
every
day
to
be
met
with
drawn
up
near
logan
hill
while
the
wagoners
unhitched
their
teams
to
assist
each
other
in
pulling
through
the
mire
at
some
places
stakes
were
set
up
to
warn
teams
of
the
quicksand
pits
at
others
the
fences
were
pulled
down
and
a
new
road
made
through
the
fields
transportation
facilities
were
either
entirely
lacking
or
such
as
to
make
travel
both
expensive
and
hazardous
it
is
difficult
to
realize
that
as
late
as
the
roads
over
a
large
part
of
pennsylvania
were
narrow
paths
which
had
been
made
through
the
woods
by
indians
and
traders
absence
of
roads
in
the
interior
the
isolation
of
interior
settlements
finds
apt
illustration
in
the
wyoming
valley
this
rich
region
along
the
susquehanna
had
been
until
almost
completely
cut
off
from
the
outer
world
a
small
colony
had
moved
in
from
the
east
and
taking
color
of
title
from
connecticut
disclaimed
the
sovereignty
of
the
quaker
proprietary
war
consequently
broke
out
between
this
isolated
settlement
and
the
pennsylvania
government
several
military
expeditions
were
sent
out
to
reduce
the
yankees
to
submission
but
the
absence
of
roads
and
the
necessity
of
carrying
provisions
on
horseback
left
the
determined
pioneers
masters
of
the
situation
when
the
larger
issue
the
revolutionary
war
suspended
local
strife
the
spring
after
burgoyne
surrender
at
saratoga
the
settlers
of
the
wyoming
valley
learned
that
a
detachment
of
johnson
royal
greens
and
rangers
with
a
company
of
tories
had
allied
themselves
with
the
seneca
indians
and
were
preparing
to
descend
upon
the
valley
a
courier
was
despatched
to
congress
and
appeals
for
aid
were
made
to
the
neighboring
states
but
the
isolation
which
had
before
served
for
defense
now
brought
disaster
with
the
june
freshet
the
british
allies
came
down
from
tioga
and
nothing
but
ruins
were
left
to
mark
the
scene
one
of
the
reasons
urged
for
the
removal
of
the
state
capitol
from
philadelphia
to
harrisburg
in
was
the
cost
of
travel
which
bore
heavily
upon
legislators
from
the
interior
the
roads
of
new
england
the
early
settlers
of
springfield
massachusetts
were
obliged
to
send
their
household
goods
from
roxbury
around
by
way
of
long
island
sound
and
the
connecticut
river
but
they
themselves
were
able
to
proceed
on
foot
along
an
indian
trail
in
time
this
trail
was
widened
and
as
the
bay
path
and
the
boston
road
occupied
an
important
place
among
the
transportation
routes
of
the
colonies
it
was
however
little
more
than
a
narrow
wagon
path
until
after
the
revolution
and
so
indistinct
was
it
that
travelers
frequently
wandered
off
the
route
a
curious
stone
post
marks
the
place
near
the
national
armory
at
springfield
where
in
a
western
massachusetts
merchant
lost
his
way
and
set
up
a
guide
for
other
travelers
even
as
late
as
there
were
but
two
stages
between
boston
and
new
york
and
a
week
was
required
for
the
journey
john
bernard
the
english
actor
thus
described
a
typical
new
england
road
in
though
far
better
than
in
any
other
quarter
of
the
union
the
frequent
jolts
and
plunges
of
the
vehicle
brought
it
into
sad
comparison
with
the
of
england
very
often
we
surprised
a
family
of
pigs
taking
a
bath
in
a
gully
of
sufficient
compass
to
admit
the
coach
as
often
such
chasms
were
filled
with
piles
of
stones
that
at
a
distance
looked
like
indian
tumuli
the
driver
skill
in
steering
was
eminent
i
found
there
were
two
evils
to
be
dreaded
in
new
england
traveling
a
clayey
soil
in
wet
weather
which
unqualified
with
gravel
made
the
road
a
canal
and
a
sandy
one
in
summer
which
might
emphatically
be
called
an
enormous
insect
preserve
such
testimony
makes
real
the
difficulties
which
attended
travel
over
the
important
routes
and
enables
one
to
understand
how
it
could
have
required
washington
nearly
two
weeks
to
make
the
trip
from
philadelphia
to
cambridge
at
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
after
the
revolutionary
war
before
the
revolution
the
subject
of
road
improvement
was
seldom
considered
in
public
assemblies
and
the
early
laws
contain
few
provisions
even
for
common
roads
those
who
proposed
measures
for
general
improvement
met
with
little
encouragement
as
early
as
william
penn
suggested
the
practicability
of
a
waterway
from
the
schuylkill
to
the
susquehanna
in
david
rittenhouse
of
philadelphia
and
provost
smith
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
proposed
a
similar
project
and
made
surveys
of
the
route
by
the
swatara
and
the
tulpehocken
in
the
american
philosophical
society
interested
itself
in
a
canal
survey
between
chesapeake
bay
and
the
delaware
recommending
the
enterprise
to
the
public
in
governor
moore
of
new
york
projected
a
canal
around
the
canajoharie
falls
of
the
mohawk
but
to
none
of
these
suggestions
was
there
any
active
response
for
the
time
was
not
ripe
for
such
undertakings
contributing
to
the
impulse
immediately
after
the
war
of
independence
was
a
newly
awakened
community
interest
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
there
were
two
distinct
classes
in
the
united
states
a
highly
localized
class
of
the
seaboard
and
of
the
inland
trade
routes
and
a
widely
distributed
agricultural
class
american
commerce
was
largely
confined
to
american
products
england
france
and
holland
monopolized
the
trade
of
their
colonies
and
in
other
ways
favored
their
own
merchantmen
in
foreign
trade
such
being
the
condition
our
commercial
advantage
lay
in
the
development
of
our
own
resources
the
settlement
of
the
middle
atlantic
states
and
of
the
valleys
of
the
interior
only
served
to
strengthen
the
interdependence
of
the
people
who
found
a
common
interest
in
internal
improvements
to
the
agriculturist
cheap
conveyance
to
market
was
a
prerequisite
to
profitable
industry

inland
improvement
was
at
that
time
no
less
important
first
era
of
road
making
there
was
a
notable
change
in
the
popular
attitude
toward
road
making
after
the
war
and
all
men
now
saw
in
better
means
of
communication
an
instrument
for
the
establishing
of
american
supremacy
over
the
western
continent
legislatures
made
generous
appropriations

an

appropriated
to

for

other

were
passed
at
the

new

in
authorized
the
raising
by

for
the
improvement
of
various
roads
throughout
the
state
as
if
by
common
impulse
all
the
states
now
became
interested
in
road
improvement
and
congress
was
asked
to
aid
by
this
means
the
opening
up
of
the
resources
of
the
interior
beginning
of
the
canals
and
pikes
the
low
cost
of
water
transportation
had
early
directed
popular
attention
to
canals
as
a
means
of
overcoming
obstructions
in
natural
water
courses
thereby
serving
the
needs
of
the
inland
population
and
also
providing
the
means
for
diverting
trade
from
one
seaport
to
another
the
revolutionary
war
was
hardly
over
when
charles
carroll
organized
a
company
to
open
a
canal
about
the
obstructions
in
the
lower
susquehanna
those
who
took
the
most
active
interest
in
canal
construction
at
this
time
were
men
who
like
washington
viewed
the
future
with
patriotic
interest
this
interest
however
was
one
which
did
not
appeal
to
the
private
investor
an
enterprise
based
upon
such
public
consideration
required
government
support
this
period
also
marked
the
beginning
of
turnpike
construction
the
first
turnpike
road
in
this
country
of
which
we
have
a
record
was
built
between
alexandria
and
the
lower
shenandoah
it
was
begun
in
and
its
completion
was
the
cause
of
great
satisfaction
to
jefferson
and
other
men
of
virginia
who
had
labored
in
the
cause
of
a
broader
national
life
alexandria
was
at
that
time
an
important
competitor
of
the
other
seaboard
cities
across
the
maryland
peninsula
on
the
chesapeake
lay
baltimore
a
commercial
rival
of
both
alexandria
and
philadelphia
in
the
grand
jury
sitting
at
baltimore
called
attention
to
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
roads
leading
to
that
city
and
urged
the
authorities
to
take
immediate
action
as
a
result
the
county
government
ordered
the
old
frederick
reistertown
and
york
roads
turnpiked
at
public
expense
to
the
west
of
philadelphia
lay
the
susquehanna
valley
the
natural
outlet
of
this
growing
region
was
down
the
chesapeake
to
baltimore
to
attract
traffic
to
the
quaker
city
a
company
was
organized
in
philadelphia
in
to
build
the
lancaster
pike
which
was
the
first
turnpike
in
this
country
built
by
voluntary
subscription
effect
of
european
wars
on
american
situation
the
outbreak
of
the
european
wars
in
was
followed
by
a
marked
change
in
the
american
industrial
situation
the
immediate
effect
upon
the
grain
growing
of
the
west
was
to
increase
the
demand
for
wheat
prices
of
cereals
rose
to
twice
their
former
height
the
average
price
of
flour
during
the
seven
years
from
to
had
been
about
a
barrel
the
average
price
from
to
the
two
years
of
peace
and
excluded
was
such
was
the
inducement
to
grain
growing
during
this
period
back
from
the
north
atlantic
coast
radiated
rich
valleys
large
tracts
of
agricultural
lands
which
were
well
adapted
to
grain
growing
a
rush
set
in
for
the
unclaimed
resources
of
new
york
pennsylvania
and
maryland
and
for
a
time
the
tide
of
migration
moved
to
the
westward
along
the
ohio
and
the
border
of
the
great
lakes
those
who
cultivated
lands
near
the
coast
shared
in
the
increased
prosperity
due
to
the
european
disturbance
but
unless
they
could
obtain
better
means
of
transportation
those
who
had
located
inland
soon
found
that
they
could
profit
little
grain
as
compared
with
cotton
and
tobacco
was
a
low
priced
product
at
best
the
cost
of
transportation
was
ten
dollars
a
ton
for
each
haul
in
many
places
it
was
much
higher
americans
turn
to
home
markets
before
the
country
had
come
to
be
divided
into
three
sections
the
commercial
shipbuilding
east
the
cotton
and
tobacco
exporting
south
and
the
isolated
grain
growing
interior
linked
with
which
was
a
languishing
manufacturing
interest
on
or
near
the
seaboard
beyond
a
limited
range
the
producing
proportion
of
our
population
could
not
participate
in
the
profits
of
the
european
trade
the
grain
growers
demanded
a
market
and
the
manufacturers
saw
their
profits
swept
away
by
an
influx
of
foreign
goods
these
were
the
interests
which
suffered
from
the
diversion
of
capital
to
shipbuilding
and
foreign
trade
both
looked
to
internal
improvements
as
a
solution
of
their
troubles
their
only
hope
was
in
a
in
better
roads
and
in
the
development
of
the
resources
about
them
in
the
united
states
agriculturist
and
manufacturer
turned
to
the
national
government
for
relief
but
so
long
as
the
administration
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
foreign
trade
party
the
way
was
blocked
to
internal
improvements
during
the
first
three
administrations
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
the
individualistic
republicans
had
been
unable
to
gain
control
of
the
government
but
with
the
admission
of
kentucky
tennessee
and
ohio
and
the
settlement
of
the
parts
of
the
sea
coast
states
remote
from
transportation
facilities
the
constituency
gained
the
balance
of
power
it
was
to
the
voters
of
these
new
regions
that
jefferson
owed
his
success
it
was
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
west
for
an
outlet
to
the
gulf
that
louisiana
was
purchased
to
satisfy
the
insistent
demand
for
internal
improvements
the
national
government
also
built
the
cumberland
road
and
contributed
to
many
other
transportation
projects
it
was
the
open
hostility
of
the
west
and
south
toward
the
commercial
east
which
forced
the
embargo
and
broke
down
the
domination
of
the
seaboard
interests
in
national
affairs
river
traffic
developed
by
private
capital
the
inland
routes
which
required
the
least
capital
to
utilize
in
a
primitive
way
were
the
rivers
here
the
chief
obstacle
was
the
current
in
the
early
nineteenth
century
long
lines
of
rafts
and
arks
might
be
seen
floating
down
the
connecticut
the
hudson
the
susquehanna
and
the
potomac
there
were
miles
of
rivers
tributary
to
the
atlantic
seaboard
which
were
navigable
or
which
needed
only
to
be
cleared
of
snags
and
rocks
to
render
them
available
for
use
by
small
craft
it
was
estimated
that
on
the
eastern
slope
there
were
about
miles
of
streams
which
might
be
utilized
by
the
construction
of
locks
and
canals
in
the
mississippi
valley
there
were
miles
of
navigable
rivers
and
about
more
which
were
considered
possibilities
but
with
a
three
or
current
it
was
impracticable
to
row
pole
or
warp
a
boat
and
cargo
upstream
for
a
long
distance
the
result
was
that
along
those
streams
which
nature
had
provided
as
highways
the
producer
first
built
his
boat
out
of
the
timbers
of
the
forest
then
loaded
it
with
the
produce
of
his
farm
or
mill
and
floated
down
stream
to
market
upon
reaching
his
destination
he
abandoned
his
craft
and
returned
by
stage
or
on
foot
this
was
indeed
an
expensive
process
expensive
in
time
expensive
in
funds
and
expensive
in
human
effort
it
was
an
expense
of
production
however
and
one
which
did
not
require
capitalization
it
was
not
until
that
the
steamboat
became
a
commercial
success
at
this
time
new
york
was
becoming
well
settled
and
as
the
hudson
was
a
natural
highway
a
boat
which
could
drive
against
wind
and
stream
had
every
promise
of
success
robert
fulton
who
had
been
interested
in
the
problem
of
steam
navigation
since
returned
from
europe
after
several
years
of
investigation
and
brought
back
one
of
watt
engines
he
obtained
the
financial
of
chancellor
livingston
and
together
they
obtained
a
monopoly
of
steam
navigation
in
new
york
waters
a
boat
was
fitted
with
the
watt
engine
and
a
successful
trip
was
made
from
new
york
to
albany
and
return
the
route
yielded
large
profits
from
the
start
and
other
boats
were
built
by
six
boats
were
doing
a
profitable
business
on
the
hudson
the
success
of
fulton
and
livingston
proved
attractive
to
others
crowded
out
of
new
york
waters
by
the
monopoly
john
stevens
in
took
a
steamboat
around
from
hoboken
into
the
delaware
the
phoenix
now
found
business
so
good
in
those
waters
where
fitch
had
failed
that
it
was
soon
followed
by
two
other
boats
soon
the
whole
atlantic
seaboard
including
the
lawrence
was
supplied
with
steam
craft
but
enterprise
in
steamboat
navigation
was
not
confined
to
the
coast
business
opportunities
in
the
mississippi
valley
attracted
the
attention
of
one
nicholas
roosevelt
who
proposed
to
fulton
and
livingston
that
he
would
make
a
trip
to
new
orleans
to
survey
the
prospects
for
an
inland
water
route
with
the
understanding
that
they
should
finance
a
steamboat
line
if
his
report
was
favorable
so
favorable
was
it
that
he
was
placed
in
charge
of
the
construction
of
a
river
boat
at
pittsburg
and
in
the
made
her
maiden
trip
down
the
mississippi
thereafter
roosevelt
boat
took
a
regular
route
between
new
orleans
and
natchez
other
boats
were
added
but
it
was
not
until
that
a
voyage
was
made
upstream
from
new
orleans
to
louisville
and
cincinnati
after
assisting
jackson
in
the
campaign
about
new
orleans
the
taking
advantage
of
high
water
steamed
to
louisville
in
in
the
accomplished
the
same
feat
while
the
river
was
within
her
banks
and
the
public
became
convinced
of
the
practicability
of
upstream
navigation
the
same
year
the
reduced
the
time
to
twenty
days
and
by
days
with
the
success
of
the
steamboat
the
middle
west
was
opened
to
rapid
communication
with
the
gulf
wagon
roads
into
the
interior
from
to
two
changes
had
a
marked
effect
upon
the
national
attitude
toward
internal
improvements
before
the
outbreak
of
the
european
wars
manufactures
had
made
some
progress
in
new
england
and
in
pennsylvania
during
the
first
struggle
and
before
the
peace
of
amiens
the
only
serious
obstacle
to
american
industry
was
the
tendency
to
divert
capital
to
wheat
raising
shipbuilding
and
foreign
trade
prices
were
high
and
the
makers
of
goods
found
encouragement
in
large
profits
with
the
cessation
of
hostilities
american
manufacturers
looked
to
congress
for
protection
for
foreign
goods
poured
into
the
country
in
such
quantities
and
at
such
prices
as
to
threaten
the
destruction
of
domestic
production
at
the
most
however
the
manufacturing
population
was
relatively
small
but
the
disturbances
to
industry
from
to
were
such
as
to
throw
many
out
of
employment
and
to
bring
to
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
and
starvation
those
who
had
been
engaged
in
shipbuilding
and
foreign
trade
a
great
exodus
to
the
interior
was
the
result
in
wagons
on
horseback
or
on
foot
sometimes
using
handcarts
sleds
and
wheelbarrows
to
carry
their
provisions
and
light
luggage
emigrants
crowded
the
wooded
paths
that
led
to
the
west
where
they
might
find
conditions
more
favorable
to
independent
livelihood
all
these
conditions
conspired
to
increase
the
depression
in
the
east
and
drive
her
people
into
agriculture
and
the
development
of
the
interior
while
the
opening
of
the
mississippi
by
the
steamboat
added
to
the
attractions
of
the
rich
valleys
in
the
middle
west
but
upon
his
arrival
in
the
west
the
newcomer
found
himself
beyond
the
range
of
any
market
except
new
orleans
to
reach
this
market
he
would
produce
or
get
together
a
quantity
of
corn
flour
bacon
and
such
articles
he
would
build
a
boat
on
the
shore
of
some
river
or
large
creek
load
his
wares
into
it
and
awaiting
the
rise
with
a
few
of
his
negroes
to
assist
him
would
float
down
to
new
orleans
the
voyage
was
long
tedious
and
expensive
when
he
arrived
there
he
found
himself
in
a
strange
city
filled
with
sharpers
ready
to
take
advantage
of
his
necessities
everybody
combined
against
him
to
profit
by
his
ignorance
of
business
want
of
friends
or
commercial
connections
and
nine
times
out
of
ten
he
returned
a
broken
merchant
his
journey
home
was
performed
on
foot
through
three
or
four
nations
of
indians
inhabiting
the
western
parts
of
mississippi
tennessee
and
kentucky
he
returned
to
a
desolate
farm
which
had
been
neglected
whilst
he
had
been
gone
one
crop
was
lost
by
absence
and
another
by
taking
it
to
market
this
kind
of
business
was
persevered
in
astonishingly
for
several
years
to
the
great
injury
and
utter
ruin
of
a
great
many
people
it
was
the
demand
for
safe
transportation
arising
out
of
this
situation
which
made
roosevelt
steamboat
enterprise
a
success
development
of
coastwise
commerce
the
british
blockade
of
our
coast
during
the
war
of
had
a
marked
effect
upon
the
development
of
inland
routes
of
transportation
as
may
be
seen
from
the
following
the
interruption
of
the
coasting
trade
was
indeed
a
very
serious
affair
for
years
past
that
trade
had
given
occupation
to
thousands
of
coasters
and
tens
of
thousands
of
sailors
the
shoes
made
at
lynn
the
yankee
notions
of
connecticut
the
cotton
cards
the
domestic
cottons
the
playing
cards
produced
in
new
england
the
flour
of
the
middle
states
the
east
india
goods
brought
in
from
abroad
had
found
a
ready
market
at
charleston
savannah
and
augusta
whence
great
quantities
of
rice
and
cotton
were
brought
north
on
the
arrival
of
the
british
fleet
this
trade
no
longer
to
be
carried
on
in
safety
by
water
began
of
necessity
to
be
carried
on
by
land
at
first
some
merchants
at
boston
having
chartered
a
few
wagons
despatched
them
with
loads
to
philadelphia
and
even
to
baltimore
this
was
enough
the
hint
was
taken
a
new
industry
sprang
up
and
by
early
summer
the
roads
leading
southward
exhibited
one
continuous
stream
of
huge
wagons
tugged
along
by
double
or
triple
teams
of
horses
or
of
oxen
no
distance
was
then
too
great
and
hundreds
of
them
would
make
their
way
from
salem
and
boston
to
augusta
and
savannah
an
estimate
made
towards
the
close
of
the
year
places
the
number
of
wagons
thus
employed
at
four
thousand
and
the
number
of
cattle
horses
and
oxen
at
twenty
thousand
nor
does
this
seem
excessive
for
a
traveler
who
drove
from
new
york
to
richmond
declares
that
he
passed
two
hundred
and
sixty
wagons
on
the
way
the
capitalization
of
turnpikes
both
overland
trade
and
westward
migration
drew
attention
to
the
importance
of
good
roads
both
swelled
the
receipts
of
turnpike
companies
and
gave
encouragement
to
investment
of
local
capital
in
transportation
improvement
by
the
lancaster
road
had
been
extended
to
pittsburg
and
a
regular
stage
line
established
which
made
a
trip
each
way
once
a
week
state
governments
lent
every
encouragement
to
the
building
of
turnpike
roads
to
the
extent
of
subscribing
to
their
from
contemporary
writings
and
charter
grants
it
is
estimated
that
nearly
eight
hundred
turnpike
companies
were
organized
before
the
end
of
the
war
of
pennsylvania
was
in
granting
liberal
charters
and
toll
rights
thereby
encouraging
the
people
of
the
more
thickly
settled
districts
to
make
such
improvements
for
themselves
the
corporations
thus
formed
had
little
difficulty
in
obtaining
capital
subscriptions
whether
for
the
construction
of
turnpikes
or
bridges
or
for
the
operation
of
ferries
to
the
stock
of
these
corporations
several
of
the
states
subscribed
in
varying
amounts
although
a
few
toll
roads
were
constructed
before
that
time
the
turnpike
movement
may
be
said
to
date
from
the
opening
of
the
nineteenth
century
turnpikes
so
called
from
the
revolving
or
turning
bar
or
pike
which
when
set
across
a
toll
road
prevented
passage
until
charges
were
paid
were
macadamized
or
otherwise
improved
at
a
cost
varying
from
to
per
mile
almost
without
exception
they
followed
in
a
general
way
the
old
lines
which
had
been
worked
out
when
travel
on
foot
or
on
horseback
was
the
chief
method
of
communication
but
wherever
possible
they
were
made
straight
going
over
and
not
around
hills
and
other
obstacles
when
the
boston
and
salem
turnpike
was
built
a
small
but
deep
pond
was
encountered
but
instead
of
going
around
the
road
crossed
on
a
floating
bridge
the
construction
of
bridges
and
the
operation
of
ferries
were
parts
of
this
larger
turnpike
movement
and
like
the
turnpikes
themselves
they
were
usually
disappointing
to
those
who
had
invested
with
the
hope
of
large
dividends
at
best
this
movement
did
but
little
to
supply
the
great
need
for
improved
transportation
to
passenger
service
it
was
a
great
boon
in
that
it
added
much
to
personal
comfort
though
the
time
and
cost
of
travel
were
little
reduced
required
five
dollars
and
fifty
cents
to
pay
tolls
from
philadelphia
to
new
york
besides
the
hotel
bills
and
other
expenses
of
the
it
took
a
week
to
go
from
philadelphia
to
pittsburg
what
the
country
most
needed
a
cheap
method
of
handling
the
bulky
products
of
the
interior
was
not
supplied
freight
was
carried
upon
the
turnpike
with
great
difficulty
and
expense
and
heavy
goods
were
compelled
to
remain
untouched
on
account
of
the
high
tolls
revival
of
canal
construction
to
meet
this
situation
canals
had
been
proposed
long
before
the
period
of
turnpike
building
and
some
surveys
had
been
made
but
because
of
lack
of
capital
construction
was
deferred
the
earliest
projects
were
for
short
cuts
around
rapids
or
falls
or
between
neighboring
waters
but
bolder
plans
followed
the
first
canal
of
any
importance
actually
begun
in
the
united
states
was
the
cut
through
the
rocks
about
the
south
hadley
falls
of
the
connecticut
the
massachusetts
legislature
passed
an
act
in
incorporating
the
proprietors
of
the
locks
and
canals
on
connecticut
river
work
was
begun
at
once
with
dutch
capital
and
in
two
years
the
canal
was
completed
the
santee
canal
in
south
carolina
was
the
first
large
work
of
this
kind
constructed
in
the
united
states
it
connected
the
santee
river
with
the
cooper
river
at
charleston
and
it
was
opened
in
its
length
was
miles
and
its
cost
a
much
more
important
project
was
the
middlesex
canal
in
massachusetts
a
charter
for
which
was
obtained
in
this
canal
extended
from
the
charles
river
to
the
merrimac
miles
and
was
designed
to
attract
to
boston
the
trade
normally
tributary
to
portsmouth
work
was
begun
in
and
ten
years
later
the
canal
was
opened
for
traffic
though
it
was
not
entirely
completed
until
the
successful
completion
of
the
erie
canal
which
became
an
assured
fact
long
before
its
actual
accomplishment
in
stimulated
similar
projects
all
over
the
country
the
local
strife
between
trade
centers
combined
with
the
local
demand
for
outlet
set
a
number
of
private
projects
in
motion
boston
philadelphia
baltimore
and
georgetown
were
successfully
appealed
to
for
support
for
transportation
routes
which
would
enable
them
to
compete
with
new
york
for
the
trade
of
the
west
the
blackstone
canal
company
chartered
by
rhode
island
and
massachusetts
in
began
the
construction
of
a
canal
along
the
blackstone
river
to
connect
providence
and
worcester
and
this
route
was
opened
for
traffic
in
another
new
england
project
started
at
about
the
same
time
was
for
a
canal
to
extend
from
new
haven
northwards
to
northampton
and
on
up
the
connecticut
valley
into
vermont
two
companies
were
chartered
for
this
purpose
the
farmington
canal
in
connecticut
in
and
the
hampshire
and
hampden
canal
in
massachusetts
in
the
farmington
canal
was
completed
in
but
the
work
on
the
hampshire
and
hampden
project
was
for
a
time
abandoned
for
want
of
funds
and
the
canal
was
not
cut
through
to
northampton
until
while
carrying
a
large
traffic
this
canal
like
the
blackstone
canal
was
more
beneficial
to
the
general
business
of
the
section
traversed
than
to
those
who
held
its
stock
other
private
works
of
this
period
upon
which
large
sums
were
expended
were
the
delaware
and
raritan
canal
connecting
philadelphia
with
new
york
the
james
river
and
kanawha
an
unfinished
canal
project
in
virginia
and
the
chesapeake
and
ohio
canal
which
was
not
extended
further
west
than
cumberland
scarcity
of
capital
for
canals
on
account
of
local
needs
few
canal
or
navigation
companies
had
difficulty
in
obtaining
their
first
subscriptions
but
most
of
them
experienced
trouble
in
collecting
assessments
and
in
obtaining
additional
subscriptions
this
timidity
of
investors
it
now
appears
was
not
without
ground
for
few
of
the
private
canal
companies
were
able
to
bring
their
construction
work
to
completion
and
fewer
still
paid
any
dividends
to
their
stockholders
the
middlesex
canal
was
profitable
until
the
building
of
a
parallel
line
of
railroad
the
montague
canal
also
in
massachusetts
yielded
a
fair
return
during
the
first
twenty
years
that
followed
its
completion
in
the
delaware
and
schuylkill
canal
may
be
cited
as
a
third
exception
but
it
early
became
evident
that
public
works
of
the
number
and
magnitude
required
could
be
constructed
only
at
national
expense
as
the
constitution
contains
no
direct
provision
for
internal
improvements
the
subject
became
a
party
question
from
the
first
congress
had
appropriated
money
for
lighthouses
public
piers
buoys
and
other
aids
to
navigation
and
about
such
action
there
had
been
no
dispute
for
it
was
agreed
that
these
matters
lay
strictly
within
federal
jurisdiction
from
the
first
also
congress
had
been
petitioned
for
appropriations
for
internal
improvements
most
of
these
demands
were
local
in
character
and
so
were
easily
disposed
of
but
when
the
directors
of
the
chesapeake
and
delaware
canal
asked
congress
to
supply
the
funds
which
they
had
been
unable
to
obtain
from
sales
of
shares
the
question
was
forced
to
an
issue
two
facts
were
incontestable
the
general
importance
of
the
work
and
the
ability
of
the
national
government
to
carry
it
on
in
view
of
the
revenue
surplus
in
the
treasury
in
another
way
congress
had
already
committed
itself
to
the
support
of
public
works
so
long
as
the
country
was
made
up
of
states
bordering
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
improvements
were
matters
of
interest
to
all
alike
but
with
the
admission
of
new
states
in
the
interior
and
the
prospect
of
future
accessions
to
the
westward
as
the
country
expanded
an
element
of
injustice
seemed
to
enter
these
appropriations
which
benefited
the
seaboard
states
at
the
expense
of
all
the
feeling
of
discontent
was
intensified
by
the
fact
that
the
favored
states
were
more
thickly
settled
and
therefore
better
able
to
incur
the
expense
with
the
admission
of
ohio
however
this
was
remedied
by
the
establishment
of
the
five
per
cent
land
fund
and
the
of
the
seaboard
was
appealed
to
by
the
argument
that
the
building
of
roads
into
the
west
would
so
stimulate
sales
of
the
public
lands
as
to
increase
the
national
revenues
the
matter
of
national
aid
to
internal
improvements
was
again
brought
before
congress
in
by
calhoun
who
presented
a
bill
providing
for
the
direct
construction
of
roads
and
canals
and
the
improvement
of
waterways
out
of
a
fund
to
be
created
by
setting
apart
the
bonus
and
dividends
received
by
the
government
from
the
united
states
bank
this
bill
which
was
drawn
up
by
clay
passed
through
congress
in
but
it
was
vetoed
by
madison
who
though
favorably
disposed
toward
public
works
had
inherited
from
jefferson
a
doubt
as
to
the
rights
of
congress
to
participate
in
their
construction
without
a
constitutional
amendment
specifically
granting
the
authority
and
monroe
holding
the
same
opinion
vetoed
a
bill
for
the
repair
of
the
cumberland
road
and
submitted
to
congress
a
long
statement
of
the
principles
involved
in
his
decision
in
the
meantime
weary
of
waiting
new
york
had
succeeded
in
building
the
erie
canal
its
success
shifted
the
whole
plan
of
promotion
with
credit
established
abroad
internal
improvements
were
taken
up
by
the
states
and

decades

demands

fortunes

been

for
the
continuation
of
this
most
interesting
narrative
first

report
of
the
chief
engineer
of

railroad
company

by
edgar
thomson
chief
engineer
engineer
department
pennsylvania
june
to
the
president
and
directors
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
gentlemen
i
have
the
honor
to
communicate
to
you
the
following
report
of
the
operations
of
this
department
since
it
was
committed
to
my
charge
now
something
more
than
a
year
under
the
organization
of
the
engineer
department
as
adopted
previous
to
my
acceptance
of
the
office
you
have
conferred
upon
me
the
road
was
to
be
divided
into
three
divisions
eastern
western
and
middle
edward
miller
as
associate
engineer
was
assigned
to
the
western
and
b
foster
to
the
eastern
division
these
gentlemen
had
entered
upon
the
survey
of
their
respective
lines
previous
to
my
arrival
under
instructions
from
the
president
each
with
two
full
corps
of
assistants
the
middle
or
mountain
division
not
having
been
provided
for
i
concluded
after
a
full
consideration
of
the
subject
that
the
interest
of
the
company
would
be
best
promoted
by
so
altering
the
organization
as
to
abolish
it
altogether
and
extend
the
eastern
and
western
divisions
to
the
summit
of
the
allegheny
mountains
the
natural
boundary
between
them
under
this
arrangement
the
surveys
have
since
been
prosecuted
the
board
having
directed
me
to
cause
a
location
of
the
whole
line
from
harrisburg
to
pittsburg
to
be
made
at
the
earliest
practicable
period
i
at
once
commenced
a
reconnoissance
of
that
portion
of
the
intervening
country
over
which
it
seemed
from
an
inspection
of
a
map
of
the
state
that
the
road
would
probably
pass
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
best
plan
of
operations
to
carry
out
their
views
the
legislature
in
their
grant
to
the
company
wisely
left
the
choice
of
a
route
for
the
road
between
its
termini
entirely
free
throwing
upon
the
board
the
responsibility
of
selecting
upon
the
wide
field
that
was
opened
to
them
a
line
for
their
great
work
which
would
offer
the
cheapest
railroad
conveyance
for
the
transportation
of
freight
and
the
most
expeditious
for
travel
that
could
be
selected
between
the
west
and
the
northern
atlantic
cities
such
a
route
it
was
believed
from
previous
surveys
lay
within
the
borders
of
pennsylvania
an
expectation
which
has
been
fully
justified
by
the
results
obtained
from
our
examinations
of
the
several
routes
proposed
i
found
no
difficulty
after
a
careful
inspection
of
the
plans
of
the
various
surveys
made
under
the
authority
of
the
commonwealth
and
my
reconnoissance
of
the
country
in
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
the
valley
of
the
juniata
offered
advantages
for
a
line
which
whether
we
consider
the
low
gradients
that
may
be
obtained
along
it
or
its
general
directness
the
desiderata
required
is
without
a
rival
this
stream
has
its
source
in
the
alleghenies
and
consequently
severs
as
it
flows
towards
the
atlantic
all
the
secondary
mountain
ranges
that
lie
east
of
them
and
it
heads
opposite
to
the
black
lick
and
conemaugh
rivers
both
of
which
sever
those
on
the
west
leaving
the
main
allegheny
only
to
be
surmounted
which
would
have
to
be
encountered
upon
any
other
route
in
addition
to
many
of
the
inferior
mountain
ranges
a
more
northern
route
by
the
west
branch
of
the
susquehanna
which
has
its
source
beyond
the
allegheny
mountains
would
have
encountered
less
elevation
at
the
principal
summit
but
its
great
increased
length
precluded
its
adoption
while
on
the
other
hand
a
southern
route
though
not
indirect
was
equally
objectionable
on
account
of
the
rugged
character
of
the
country
and
the
high
gradients
necessary
to
overcome
the
numerous
summits
upon
it
a
partial
examination
of
one
of
the
proposed
southern
routes
was
made
which
followed
the
cumberland
valley
railroad
to
near
shippensburg
and
thence
crossing
to
the
west
side
of
the
valley
at
roxbury
it
passed
through
the
blue
mountain
by
a
long
tunnel
into
path
valley
thence
following
around
the
point
of
dividing
mountain
it
crossed
this
valley
and
passed
through
tuscarora
by
another
tunnel
to
the
valley
of
augwick
creek
thence
it
would
have
been
traced
between
broad
top
and
sideling
mountains
and
up
dunning
and
bob
creeks
to
the
summit
of
the
alleghenies
at
bob
creek
gap
or
turning
west
by
bedford
crossed
the
alleghenies
at
the
head
waters
of
the
tributaries
of
castleman
river
where
the
mountain
is
still
much
more
elevated
a
line
leaving
the
cumberland
valley
railroad
at
chambersburg
and
turning
the
end
of
blue
mountain
thence
seeking
the
low
depression
at
cowan
gap
in
tuscarora
would
be
too
circuitous
to
compare
favorably
with
the
bolder
line
from
shippensburg
already
described
but
that
line
would
encounter
engineering
difficulties
of
the
most
formidable
character
leaving
out
of
view
its
objectionable
gradients
and
considering
it
in
reference
to
its
cost
and
the
local
accommodations
it
would
extend
to
a
large
portion
of
the
state
at
present
in
a
great
measure
deprived
of
the
advantages
of
the
state
improvements
the
strongest
argument
in
favor
of
the
route
it
will
be
found
that
equal
accommodations
could
be
extended
to
that
region
with
a
expenditure
of
by
placing
the
main
stem
of
the
road
on
the
juniata
and
running
a
branch
along
one
of
the
comparatively
level
valleys
that
lie
between
most
of
the
parallel
mountain
ranges
that
we
pass
the
facilities
that
railroads
offer
for
extending
their
benefits
to
remote
districts
by
means
of
lateral
lines
constitute
one
of
their
chief
advantages
over
canals
and
should
prevent
the
error
too
frequently
committed
in
locating
leading
routes
of
turning
from
a
direct
course
to
accommodate
local
interests
to
the
injury
of
the
great
object
intended
to
be
accomplished
other
modifications
of
the
juniata
route
have
been
suggested
and
their
merits
fully
considered
but
upon
examination
all
of
them
tended
to
confirm
our
preference
in
favor
of
the
river
line
these
conclusions
were
communicated
to
the
board
and
the
general
route
recommended
having
been
adopted
by
them
i
proceeded
at
once
to
make
arrangements
to
have
the
line
surveyed
throughout
for
this
purpose
three
additional
corps
of
engineers
were
organized
one
for
miller
division
under
the
immediate
direction
of
leuffer
to
operate
on
the
summit
and
western
slope
of
the
mountain
and
two
upon
foster
the
first
of
which
was
placed
in
charge
of
edward
tilghman
to
whom
was
assigned
the
district
between
lewistown
and
the
confluence
of
the
raystown
branch
and
main
juniata
rivers
the
other
corps
was
given
in
charge
to
mifflin
a
gentleman
of
professional
skill
and
experience
to
whom
we
committed
the
surveys
of
the
region
from
the
raystown
branch
to
the
summit
of
the
alleghenies
embracing
the
most
important
and
difficult
district
upon
the
whole
route
to
pittsburg
these
parties
did
not
take
the
field
until
the
close
of
july
but
they
prosecuted
their
examinations
with
so
much
energy
and
success
that
we
were
enabled
to
determine
the
general
line
of
the
eastern
division
in
season
to
place
the
most
difficult
points
upon
it
under
contract
in
november
of
last
year
while
these
arrangements
were
in
progress
the
parties
previously
in
the
field
were
actively
engaged
in
examining
the
country
between
harrisburg
and
lewistown
at
the
instance
of
a
number
of
gentlemen
from
perry
county
a
line
was
tried
up
little
juniata
creek
leaving
the
susquehanna
at
petersburg
thence
near
bloomfield
and
along
sherman
valley
to
concord
gap
where
it
passed
the
tuscarora
mountain
thence
it
followed
tuscarora
valley
to
shade
creek
and
down
that
stream
to
augwick
creek
along
the
valley
of
which
it
was
carried
to
ferry
on
the
juniata
the
advantage
promised
for
this
route
was
a
considerable
saving
of
distance
the
result
however
demonstrated
that
not
only
would
we
have
had
to
encounter
gradients
running
up
as
high
as
sixty
feet
per
mile
but
the
length
of
the
line
would
be
increased
four
miles
by
its
adoption
it
was
consequently
abandoned
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
country
bordering
on
the
susquehanna
and
juniata
rivers
a
line
has
been
located
as
far
up
as
huntingdon
which
is
believed
to
be
the
best
that
can
be
obtained
if
the
valleys
of
these
streams
had
not
been
preoccupied
by
other
improvements
a
route
would
have
been
selected
differing
somewhat
in
its
details
from
that
adopted
even
for
the
short
distance
that
we
are
brought
into
close
proximity
with
them
the
cost
of
the
grading
of
the
road
has
been
greatly
enhanced
by
the
confined
ground
we
have
been
forced
upon
the
located
line
commences
at
the
harrisburg
and
lancaster
railroad
depot
thence
passing
through
harrisburg
it
follows
the
sloping
ground
between
the
canal
and
the
capitol
ridge
four
miles
when
it
crosses
the
canal
and
touching
the
point
of
blue
mountain
recrosses
and
passes
to
the
west
side
of
the
susquehanna
river
by
a
bridge
feet
in
length
and
feet
above
low
water
at
grade
line
which
enables
us
to
place
the
road
on
the
top
of
the
bridge
thence
we
pursue
this
bank
of
the
river
through
the
villages
of
duncannon
and
petersburg
to
the
juniata
along
the
southern
side
of
which
it
is
continued
through
newport
and
perrysville
to
a
point
a
short
distance
above
lewistown
here
the
line
crosses
to
the
north
side
of
the
river
and
within
a
short
distance
recrosses
to
save
nearly
a
mile
of
road
and
one
hundred
and
eighty
degrees
of
curvature
together
with
some
difficult
ground
along
the
bluff
shores
on
the
south
side
of
the
stream
after
regaining
the
southern
side
we
follow
the
river
slopes
over
favorable
ground
to
harvey
about
seven
miles
above
waynesburg
where
the
line
again
crosses
to
the
north
side
and
passing
back
of
newton
hamilton
cuts
through
the
neck
of
land
in
the
great
bend
of
that
stream
feet
in
depth
at
the
summit
and
feet
in
length
at
grade
descending
along
the
eastern
slope
of
the
river
we
once
more
cross
it
at
shaeffer
aqueduct
and
continue
upon
its
southwestern
bank
through
jack
narrows
without
meeting
any
serious
difficulties
and
finally
pass
to
its
north
side
along
which
it
is
continued
through
huntingdon
to
the
little
juniata
above
petersburg
above
huntingdon
a
preliminary
location
has
been
carried
up
the
little
juniata
to
logan
narrows
at
which
point
this
stream
divides
bald
eagle
and
brush
mountains
in
its
passage
from
tuckahoe
valley
along
the
little
juniata
from
dorsey
forge
to
the
narrows
the
line
encounters
much
difficult
ground
owing
to
the
circuitous
character
of
the
stream
and
the
high
hills
and
mountains
which
bound
its
course
to
obtain
a
route
with
easy
curves
we
are
forced
within
this
distance
to
tunnel
the
point
of
tussey
mountain
and
to
cross
the
river
twelve
times
to
follow
the
line
recommended
by
schlatter
through
this
region
curves
of
feet
radius
would
have
had
to
be
resorted
to
which
i
deem
wholly
inadmissible
upon
a
road
of
the
importance
of
that
you
have
in
view
at
logan
narrows
we
reach
the
valley
that
skirts
the
whole
eastern
base
of
the
allegheny
mountains
here
it
becomes
necessary
to
determine
the
plan
to
be
adopted
to
overcome
the
great
barrier
that
separates
us
from
the
west
if
it
is
to
be
surmounted
by
a
road
with
the
gradients
of
the
western
division
the
ascent
must
commence
at
this
point
and
gradually
wind
its
way
to
the
summit
by
an
almost
continuous
gradient
along
the
declivities
of
the
mountains
for
nearly
miles
crossing
the
several
streams
that
issue
from
it
by
high
bridges
and
cutting
through
or
tunneling
their
dividing
summits
schlatter
in
his
report
to
the
canal
commissioners
estimates
the
cost
of
grading
the
road
on
this
ascent
at
which
i
consider
too
low
for
a
line
with
the
gradient
he
adopted
but
with
the
increased
maximum
grade
found
necessary
on
the
western
division
and
a
somewhat
lengthened
line
it
would
probably
prove
sufficient
upon
my
first
reconnoissance
of
this
portion
of
the
country
it
occurred
to
me
that
its
peculiar
topographical
features
were
lost
sight
of
in
the
adoption
of
this
plan
of
ascent
which
seemed
to
look
to
the
single
object
of
obtaining
a
line
with
a
particular
gradient
without
regard
to
the
magnitude
of
the
obstacles
to
be
overcome
to
procure
it
while
by
pursuing
a
course
from
the
narrows
nearly
in
a
direct
line
to
sugar
run
gap
which
we
shall
hereafter
show
is
the
best
point
to
cross
the
mountain
the
line
would
pass
through
a
beautiful
valley
over
comparatively
favorable
ground
gradually
gaining
elevation
through
its
whole
course
without
exceeding
the
maximum
inclination
required
on
the
line
below
until
it
reaches
the
summit
of
the
valley
at
robinson
a
distance
of
fifteen
miles
at
this
point
we
attain
an
elevation
of
feet
above
tide
leaving
but
feet
to
be
overcome
to
reach
the
height
found
most
suitable
for
passing
the
mountain
which
is
attained
by
a
continuous
gradient
of
feet
per
mile
encountering
no
formidable
difficulties
a
resort
to
a
gradient
of
or
more
feet
per
mile
is
by
no
means
an
unusual
expedient
on
leading
railroads
upon
the
western
railroad
in
massachusetts
their
maximum
gradient
is
feet
per
mile
on
the
baltimore
ohio
railroad
they
now
have
between
the
waters
of
the
patapsco
and
potomac
on
each
side
of
parr
ridge
gradients
of
feet
per
mile
and
from
the
greater
elevation
of
the
allegheny
mountains
at
the
place
they
must
cross
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
their
gradients
at
that
point
will
still
be
increased
to
a
higher
rate
many
other
instances
might
be
cited
some
running
up
to
feet
per
mile
but
it
seems
unnecessary
to
extend
the
list
theoretically
the
power
necessary
to
overcome
a
given
height
is
the
same
at
all
inclinations
of
the
plane
of
ascent
but
in
practice
it
is
to
some
extent
dependent
upon
the
kind
of
power
to
be
applied
in
the
case
under
consideration
the
locomotive
steam
engine
will
be
the
medium
used
where
the
power
is
carried
with
the
train
and
forms
part
of
the
load
to
be
moved
consequently
the
cost
of
power
on
a
plane
ascending
feet
per
mile
is
greater
than
upon
one
of
a
more
moderate
inclination
of
equal
height
by
the
difference
between
the
gravity
of
the
engines
required
to
carry
the
same
load
on
both
planes
as
a
general
principle
this
would
be
true
when
the
lengths
of
the
roads
to
overcome
the
same
height
are
equal
and
it
is
necessary
to
carry
the
locomotives
required
for
the
high
gradient
over
the
same
distance
that
they
must
run
upon
the
low
gradient
but
in
one
of
these
cases
the
maximum
gradient
due
to
the
line
below
logan
narrows
is
carried
to
within
miles
of
the
summit
of
the
mountain
requiring
extra
power
for
that
distance
only
and
in
the
other
it
ends
miles
from
it
to
explain
more
fully
the
relative
value
of
the
maximum
gradients
used
on
the
different
divisions
of
our
road
i
have
prepared

miles
from

it
will
be
perceived
from
the
foregoing
table
that
three
locomotives
are
fully
sufficient
to
transport
the
same
load
up
the
feet
gradient
that
two
will
carry
on
the
gradient
of
the
western
division
and
one
on
the
eastern
hence
the
practical
working
of
the
road
on
the
two
methods
of
ascent
would
be
to
run
two
locomotives
with
the
load
brought
from
below
from
logan
narrows
to
the
summit
say
miles
up
the
feet
gradient
while
on
the
other
the
same
engine
that
brought
the
load
from
harrisburg
would
continue
with
it
to
robinson
miles
where
it
would
accompany
the
two
destined
for
pittsburg
to
the
summit
of
the
mountain
and
return
in
the
first
case
the
engines
together
will
have
traveled
miles
and
in
the
other
the
three
leaving
a
difference
in
distance
to
be
traveled
by
the
moving
power
due
to
each
full
train
from
the
east
miles
in
favor
of
the
feet
gradient
in
practice
it
will
therefore
be
seen
chiefly
on
account
of
the
actual
distance
saved
that
transportation
can
be
afforded
cheaper
in
this
case
on
the
feet
gradient
than
on
the
without
bringing
into
the
estimate
the
interest
on
that
the
latter
would
cost
to
obtain
it
more
than
the
former
under
these
circumstances
we
did
not
hesitate
when
the
choice
of
routes
was
reduced
to
a
selection
between
these
two
methods
of
overcoming
the
mountain
to
decide
in
favor
of
the
line
by
robinson
which
has
the
additional
advantage
of
bringing
us
within
miles
of
hollidaysburg
where
a
connection
may
be
made
with
the
allegheny
portage
by
a
branch
line
passing
over
favorable
ground
the
distance
from
harrisburg
to
robinson
summit
is
miles
upon
the
whole
of
this
line
the
only
extraordinary
impediments
to
the
easy
graduation
of
the
road
bed
are
the
bridge
over
the
susquehanna
a
deep
and
long
cut
near
newton
hamilton
and
a
tunnel
feet
in
length
through
a
point
of
tussey
mountain
and
in
this
distance
the
maximum
ascending
gradient
to
lewistown
is
feet
per
mile
and
descending
feet
thence
to
robinson
summit
they
are
increased
to
feet
ascending
and
feet
descending
the
descending
gradients
are
generally
so
short
that
they
will
not
be
found
in
practice
to
decrease
the
load
going
east
much
below
what
is
due
to
a
fair
load
for
a
locomotive
on
a
level
the
maximum
ascending
gradient
above
lewistown
is
determined
by
the
deep
cut
near
newton
hamilton
the
ascent
of
the
little
juniata
seems
however
to
require
to
obtain
an
economical
line
the
use
of
this
inclination
without
much
intermission
from
dorsey
forge
to
robinson
summit
below
lewistown
the
gradients
are
fixed
to
accommodate
the
increased
trade
that
would
fall
upon
the
line
between
that
place
and
harrisburg
without
increasing
the
number
of
trains
these
low
gradients
insure
to
us
the
important
advantages
of
a
single
pair
of
drivers
for
the
passenger
engines
upon
the
eastern
division
and
with
these
rates
of
inclination
we
are
enabled
to
make
the
line
conform
to
the
natural
features
of
the
country
above
high
water
mark
without
decreasing
the
curvature
below
feet
radius
except
at
the
east
end
of
the
susquehanna
bridge
where
a
radius
of
feet
has
been
admitted
all
of
our
efforts
to
save
distance
by
deviating
temporarily
from
the
immediate
valley
of
the
river
involved
either
the
use
of
high
gradients
not
justified
by
the
distance
saved
or
an
increased
cost
that
was
equally
unwarranted
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
kishacoquillas
offered
the
greatest
temptation
to
leave
the
river
route
but
here
we
would
have
had
to
encounter
gradients
in
both
directions
of
feet
per
mile
a
bridge
over
mill
creek
feet
long
high
another
over
a
small
tributary
of
the
juniata
feet
long
and
feet
in
height
together
with
several
others
or
embankments
of
great
magnitude
across
ravines
in
the
north
slope
of
the
river
hills
these
difficulties
added
to
feet
of
additional
elevation
to
be
surmounted
at
the
allentown
summit
so
greatly
overbalanced
the
small
increase
of
curvature
and
distance
of
a
mile
by
the
river
route
that
it
could
not
be
adopted
it
was
also
ascertained
that
by
the
of
the
maximum
required
on
the
valley
route
the
shortest
line
could
have
been
procured
by
the
river
and
at
the
least
cost
a
fact
conclusive
in
itself
as
to
the
proper
route
i
deemed
it
unnecessary
to
make
further
instrumental
examinations
of
the
stone
mountain
route
feeling
satisfied
that
even
if
a
line
could
be
obtained
in
that
direction
which
would
approximate
to
an
equality
in
an
engineering
point
of
view
with
the
route
selected
which
from
a
reconnoissance
of
a
portion
of
the
line
and
an
examination
of
the
plots
of
schlatter
surveys
i
should
consider
improbable
that
its
additional
cost
would
entrench
so
much
upon
the
means
of
the
company
as
to
place
it
entirely
out
of
the
question
a
line
was
traced
from
huntingdon
to
the
frankstown
branch
of
the
juniata
below
williamsburg
across
tussey
mountain
by
which
a
saving
of
distance
could
have
been
made
nearly
equal
to
the
stone
mountain
route
but
its
high
gradients
cost
and
the
length
of
time
that
it
would
require
to
build
the
road
over
it
rendered
it
equally
objectionable
the
valley
of
the
frankstown
branch
was
also
surveyed
the
route
by
it
joining
the
little
juniata
line
at
robinson
ridge
but
it
proved
both
longer
and
more
expensive
than
the
latter
the
searching
examinations
made
of
the
whole
region
offering
any
chance
for
a
more
practicable
route
on
the
north
or
south
of
the
juniata
leaves
no
doubt
upon
my
mind
but
that
the
best
line
has
been
procured
for
the
eastern
division
its
comparatively
easy
curvature
and
low
gradients
adapted
in
their
inclination
to
the
direction
of
the
largest
business
and
extending
from
the
eastern
terminus
of
our
road
to
the
foot
of
the
great
barrier
that
divides
us
from
the
west
give
it
advantages
that
are
not
equaled
by
any
other
route
proposed
between
the
east
and
west
and
can
not
be
too
highly
appreciated
by
the
company
before
determining
the
point
to
pass
the
mountain
a
full
examination
of
its
crest
was
made

had
been

beyond

this
route
would
probably
have
offered
the
greatest
advantages
to
cross
the
mountain
but
it
opens
westwardly
upon
the
deep
valley
of
clearfield
a
descent
into
which
would
involve
the
necessity
of
a
resort
to
as
steep
a
gradient
on
the
west
side
of
the
mountain
as
that
required
on
the
east
and
the
elevation
thus
lost
would
have
to
be
regained
by
following
up
the
valley
to
laurel

munster
summits
in
the
ridge
that
separates
clearfield
from
the

is
here
the
true
backbone
of

country
any
attempt
to
carry
a
line
along
the
west
slope
of
the
mountain
to
avoid
the
descent
to
clearfield
would
from
the
rugged
character
of
the
ground
prove
impracticable
without
a
vast
increase
in
its
cost
length
and
curvature
no
other
point
offers
equal
advantages
to
cross
the
mountain
until
we
reach
sugar

is
feet
below
the

may
be
reduced

more
by
a

emigh

still
lower
than

gap
could
not
on
account
of
its

be

moderate
cost
and
it
is
also
too
far
north
for
a
direct
route
to
pittsburg
south
of
the
portage
the
alleghenies
become
the
watershed
of
the
union
dividing
the
streams
that
flow
into
the
gulf
from
those
that
empty
into
the
atlantic
they
here
assume
a
more
elevated
character
than
while
separating
only
the
tributaries
of
the
susquehanna
affording
no
opportunity
to
pass
them
by
a
line
adapted
to
locomotive
power
unless
by
a
tunnel
of
immense
extent
until
we
reach
bob
creek
gap
the
accompanying
profile
which
exhibits
the
crest
line
of
the
mountain
for
miles
will
give
a
more
definite
idea
of
the
relative
height
of
these
summits
the
mountain
on
each
side
of
bob
creek
gap
rises
to
a
considerable
height
making
it
appear
to
a
casual
observer
a
very
deep
depression
and
from
this
circumstance
it
has
generally
been
considered
by
the
residents
of
the
adjoining
country
to
be
the
lowest
pass
in
the
alleghenies
and
as
it
falls
off
rapidly
on
either
side
it
has
also
been
supposed
that
it
could
be
farther
reduced
by
a
tunnel
of
moderate
extent
the
several
surveys
of
the
mountain
however
prove
it
to
be
feet
higher
than
sugar
run
gap
and
to
reduce
it
to
a
level
with
the
surface
of
the
ground
at
the
latter
point
which
is
feet
above
the
grade
of
the
adopted
line
it
would
require
a
tunnel
miles
in
length
to
be
constructed
under
very
disadvantageous
local
circumstances
cedar
swamp
gap
still
farther
south
is
feet
lower
than
creek
gap
but
it
falls
off
on
each
side
so
gradually
that
it
could
not
be
reduced
conveniently
more
than
feet
neither
of
these
points
therefore
which
are
the
only
passes
worthy
of
notice
south
of
the
portage
railroad
that
lie
within
the
region
over
which
a
direct
line
to
pittsburg
must
necessarily
traverse
afford
depressions
that
will
compare
favorably
with
those
farther
north
nor
does
the
ground
leading
to
them
east
or
west
of
the
mountains
offer
equal
facilities
to
obtain
a
line
of
uniform
ascent
to
the
summit
the
distance
from
the
conemaugh
is
too
short
to
overcome
the
elevation
with
the
gradient
used
on
the
western
division
and
from
the
juniata
the
greater
height
to
be
ascended
would
continue
the
line
so
long
upon
the
mountain
steeps
that
it
would
be
exceedingly
expensive
to
procure
a
roadbed
with
a
gradient
even
higher
than
feet
per
mile
from
the
foregoing
description
of
the
most
favorable
mountain
passes
it
will
be
seen
that
sugar
run
gap
offers
the
greatest
facilities
to
cross
the
allegheny
it
now
becomes
necessary
to
consider
in
what
direction
the
road
can
be
carried
thence
to
pittsburg
from
an
inspection
of
a
map
of
the
state
it
will
be
seen
that
a
straight
line
drawn
from
this
gap
to
pittsburg
will
fall
on
munster
beulah
and
follow
the
valley
of
black
lick
for
nearly
its
whole
extent
and
intersect
the
conemaugh
near
blairsville
thence
it
crosses
the
country
lying
within
the
elbow
formed
by
the
kiskeminetas
and
allegheny
rivers
passing
the
loyalhanna
and
crabtree
waters
and
following
generally
the
high
and
broken
ridge
parting
the
allegheny
and
monongahela
rivers
that
line
which
would
approximate
most
nearly
to
this
course
would
all
other
things
being
equal
be
the
most
desirable
for
the
road
the
operations
of
the
different
corps
on
this
division
have
been
confined
to
surveys
that
were
necessary
to
determine
the
point
of
crossing
the
mountain
and
to
the
regions
between
the
conemaugh
and
pittsburg
west
of
the
chestnut
ridge
our
examinations
have
not
yet
been
sufficiently
extensive
to
enable
me
to
give
a
full
description
of
that
part
of
the
country
between
the
mountain
and
blairsville
and
i
shall
therefore
leave
it
for
a
future
report
with
the
simple
remark
that
from
the
information
before
me
i
am
satisfied
that
a
practicable
line
may
be
obtained
by
the
valleys
either
of
the
black
lick
or
conemaugh
within
the
maximum
gradient
used
upon
the
western
division
the
district
of
country
over
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
carry
the
road
from
the
conemaugh
to
pittsburg
is
one
of
remarkable
intricacy
it
lies
wholly
within
the
coal
measures
and
has
at
some
period
evidently
been
nearly
a
level
plane
of
vast
extent
covered
by
the
ocean
the
discharge
of
the
waters
from
this
wide
spread
field
seems
to
have
been
sudden
forming
numerous
circuitous
channels
in
every
direction
cutting
deeply
into
the
soft
horizontal
strata
of
this
region
in
their
descent
to
the
tributaries
of
the
ohio
leaving
the
intervening
ridges
washed
into
so
uneven
a
surface
as
to
render
the
passage
of
a
railroad
along
them
entirely
out
of
the
question
a
line
following
the
conemaugh
which
bears
northwest
from
blairsville
to
the
allegheny
would
avoid
this
difficult
country
but
the
length
of
the
route
would
be
increased
fully
per
and
it
is
therefore
inadmissible
a
route
with
higher
gradients
than
those
adopted
on
the
juniata
throughout
this
division
seems
to
be
called
for
by
the
topography
of
the
country
in
his
report
upon
the
western
division
miller
gives
the
following
account
of
the
surveys
conducted
under
his
direction
by
day
and
pemberton
his
principal
assistants
if
a
straight
line
be
drawn
from
blairsville
to
pittsburg
it
will
be
seen
that
turtle
creek
is
the
only
stream
that
approximates
to
the
proper
course
of
the
road
whilst
the
loyalhanna
the
chief
tributary
of
the
conemaugh
crosses
it
nearly
at
right
angles
and
spruce
run
roaring
run
porter
run
beaver
run
and
others
intersect
it
at
various
angles
of
obliquity
much
time
and
labor
were
bestowed
by
schlatter
and
his
principal
assistant
roebling
upon
the
investigation
of
this
district
and
their
maps
and
profiles
loaned
to
us
by
the
canal
commissioners
have
been
of
much
service
in
our
examinations
from
a
careful
investigation
of
preferred
route
on
the
ground
it
appeared
possible
to
avoid
some
of
the
most
formidable
obstacles
which
he
encountered
by
adopting
a
higher
gradient
than
his
maximum
of
feet
per
mile
and
by
a
reasonable
increase
of
distance
at
a
few
points
our
trial
lines
confirmed
this
and
in
the
location
made
a
maximum
of
in
or
feet
per
mile
has
been
used
at
several
places
the
cheapness
of
fuel
throughout
the
whole
extent
of
the
western
division
renders
this
increase
of
gradient
less
objectionable
than
elsewhere
bituminous
coal
of
the
best
quality
is
everywhere
abundant
and
can
be
delivered
at
the
depots
at
from
to
cents
per
ton
the
principal
changes
made
in
the
route
referred
to
in

describes
as
follows
upon
the
white

our
line
keeps
the
left
bank
entirely
to
its

avoiding
a
tunnel
of
feet
leading
into
the
valley
of

and
reducing
that
over
the

west
of

we
run
level
round
the
hill
between
porter
run
and
beaver
run
avoiding
the
still
house
summit
entirely
where
a
tunnel
of
feet
was
proposed
with
a
cut
of
feet
at
its
western
end
running
out
to
grade
in
a
distance
of

like
the
letter
the
former

crossed
one
of
these
bends
by
a
tunnel
feet
long
whilst
ours
crosses
the
other
by
a
short
deep
cut
following
a
remarkable
pass
by
which
the
hill
is
nearly
cut
through
these
changes
have
reduced
many
of
the
deep
cuts
avoided
several
bridges
saved
three
tunnels
and
reduced
the
length
of
a
fourth
amounting
in
all
to
a
reduction
of
feet
of
tunneling
after
reaching
the
monongahela
two
routes
present
themselves
one
following
the
bank
of
the
stream
to
pittsburg
and
the
other
ascending
along
the
slope
of
the
river
hills
enters
a
valley
leading
by
wilkinsburg
and
east
liberty
thence
following
this
valley
it
descends
two
mile
run
and
enters
the
city
on
the
allegheny
side
the
latter
though
the
longest
route
and
requiring
gradients
of
feet
per
mile
has
been
adopted
as
it
presented
the
only
apparently
feasible
route
by
which
a
connection
could
be
formed
with
a
road
extending
towards
the
great
west
the
comparative
cost
of
grading
and
damages
upon
the
two
lines
would
be
rather
in
favor
of
the
route
adopted
a
line
has
also
been
located
from
the
junction
of
turtle
and
bush
creeks
which
passes
up
bush
creek
and
through
greensburg
to
bernhard
summit
thence
by
the
valleys
of
fourteen
mile
run
sauxman
and
magee
runs
to
the
conemaugh
at
the
gap
through
chestnut
ridge
if
the
conemaugh
route
by
johnstown
should
be
adopted
the
line
by
greensburg
will
be
about
miles
longer
than
that
by
turtle
creek
but
passes
east
of
the
loyalhanna
over
much
more
favorable
ground
than
any
other
line
examined
its
advantages
in
relation
to
the
local
trade
of
a
rich
and
populous
section
of
country
west
and
east
of
chestnut
ridge
through
the
gap
formed
by
the
loyalhanna
give
it
strong
claim
for
consideration
whether
the
increased
length
of
the
line
and
the
difficulties
west
of
greensburg
will
be
sufficient
to
counterbalance
these
local
advantages
we
will
leave
undecided
until
the
comparative
estimates
have
been
fully
made
out
another
line
was
traced
leaving
greensburg
and
passing
into
ligonier

thence
north
of

further

will

the

to
the
summit
of

about
four
miles
as
a
connection
with

railroad
would
insure
to
us
most
of
the
advantages
of
an
independent
road
to
the
western
base
of
the
mountain
it
is
evidently
the
policy
of
the
company
to
make
it
at
the
earliest
practicable
moment
our
location
falling
within
miles
of
that
road
it
becomes
a
very
small
matter
to
effect
a
junction
with
it
if
the
present

of
the

however
would
justify
the
expenditure
the

could
readily

however
the
cheapest

most
speedy
way
of

when
our

it

the

having

i
have
thought
it
best
thus
early
to

an

of

of
the
whole

for
their
guidance
it
will
be
recollected
that
the

for

is
made
in
part
upon
experimental
surveys
with
full
allowances
for
contingencies
by
the
close
of
the
year
we
hope
to
be
able
to
give
an
estimate
of
the
whole
road
in
detail
from
actual
location
which
may
show
a
somewhat
reduced
cost
under
the
contemplated
connection
with
that
road
the
allegheny
portage
becomes
an
important
part
of
our
line
and
for
the
information
of
the
board
i
insert
the
following
description
of
it
extracted
from
a
pamphlet
written
by
roberts
civil
engineer
the
portage
railroad
consists
of
eleven
levels
or
graded
lines
and
ten
inclined
planes
the
ascent
from
johnstown
to
the
summit
is
feet
in
a
distance
of
miles
and
the
descent
from
the
summit
to
hollidaysburg
is
feet
in
a
distance
of
miles
there
are
five
inclined
planes
on
each
side
of
the
mountain
varying
in
inclination
from
to
or
from
feet
to

to

they
are

in

with
resolutions
of
the
board
eighteen
miles
of
the
grading
on
the
eastern
and
fifteen
on
the
western
ends
of
the
road
were
placed
under
contract
in
july
last
in
november
the
contracts
upon
the
eastern
division
were
extended
to
lewistown
and
on
the
to
huntingdon
together
with
a
few
miles
of
heavy
work
along
the
little
juniata
embracing
altogether
miles
very
little
of
the
grading
on
the
western
division
has
been
executed
as
there
appeared
to
be
no
sufficient
reason
for
pressing
that
portion
of
the
road
until
the
means
of
the
company
would
justify
a
larger
expenditure
upon
it
than
they
have
heretofore
the
work
upon
the
eastern
division
has
been
retarded
from
the
scarcity
of
labor
time
seems
to
be
required
to
collect
the
necessary
force
upon
the
line
with
the
exception
however
of
the
susquehanna
bridge
the
grading
will
be
prepared
for
the
superstructure
to
lewistown
this
year
the
masonry
of
that
important
job
was
first
allotted
to
contractors
the
principal
of
the
firm
though
highly
recommended
by
the
officers
of
the
reading
railroad
proved
unequal
to
the
task
he
had
undertaken
and
their
contract
was
abandoned
in
consequence
the
remnant
of
last
season
after
the
contract
was
let
was
mostly
lost
the
work
has
been
to
holman
simons
and
burke
who
have
carried
it
forward
satisfactorily
the
prevalence
of
high
water
since
the
season
for
laying
masonry
commenced
has
prevented
as
much
progress
at
this
time
as
could
have
been
desired
but
we
still
entertain
hopes
that
it
will
be
completed
before
the
ensuing
winter
if
this
is
accomplished
the
road
can
be
opened
to
lewistown
next
spring
under
any
ordinary
circumstances
it
will
be
finished
to
huntingdon
miles
by
the
close
of
navigation
in
a
point
as
low
down
as
we
may
anticipate
a
profitable
use
of
the
road
from
our
arrangements
have
been
made
with
a
view
to
the
completion
of
the
road
to
the
allegheny
portage
early
in
the
spring
of
an
earlier
period
could
not
be
fixed
owing
to
the
magnitude
of
some
of
the
work
on
the
little
juniata
a
portion
of
which
embracing
the
tunnel
through
a
point
of
tussey
mountain
was
located
and
contracted
for
last
december
to
avoid
delay
and
a
premature
expenditure
of
capital
on
the
lighter
work
which
would
have
followed
a
general
letting
of
the
whole
road
at
that
time
or
since
even
if
it
could
have
been
prepared
for
contract
in
season
if
sufficient
means
shall
be
obtained
to
prosecute
the
western
division
i
would
recommend
that
the
heavy
portions
of
the
work
between
the
conemaugh
and
the
confluence
of
brush
and
turtle
creeks
should
be
placed
under
contract
together
with
the
grading
continuously
from
the
portage
road
to
the
point
of
divergence
of
the
line
from
that
river
towards
pittsburg
if
the
conemaugh
route
is
adopted
when
the
connection
is
made
with
the
portage
railroad
from
the
east
there
will
then
be
a
continuous
railroad
from
philadelphia
to
johnstown
miles
in
length
and
if
opened
at
the
same
time
to
near
blairsville
it
will
be
extended
to
miles
with
only
miles
of
turnpike
thence
to
pittsburg
or
miles
of
canal
navigation
giving
a
line
of
communication
with
the
ohio
river
far
superior
to
any
railroad
route
existing
or
any
that
will
at
that
time
be
built
on
freight
destined
to
the
interior
of
ohio
but
one
transshipment
will
then
be
necessary
the
canal
boats
loaded
at
the
terminus
of
the
road
can
be
conveyed
to
any
point
upon
the
ohio
canal
if
your
road
possesses
no
other
source
of
revenue
than
the
local
travel
and
transportation
of
the
rich
and
populous
region
to
be
traversed
by
it
secured
as
it
will
be
from
competing
lines
by
stretching
out
on
either
side
from
the
susquehanna
to
the
potomac
they
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
its
construction
the
influence
of
the
pennsylvania
canal
has
called
into
activity
all
the
elements
necessary
to
render
the
enterprise
profitable
and
in
consequence
it
will
be
more
successful
with
that
improvement
as
a
pioneer
rival
than
if
it
was
now
to
enter
upon
an
unoccupied
field
whatever
may
be
the
effect
of
your
work
upon
the
business
of
the
canal
and
i
do
not
believe
it
will
be
injurious
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
it
will
add
very
materially
to
the
revenues
of
the
commonwealth
important
as
the
local
sources
of
revenue
are
to
the
company
they
will
afford
but
a
limited
amount
of
business
compared
with
that
to
be
derived
from
the
great
west
the
route
of
your
improvement
is
directly
on
the
line
that
would
be
most
desirable
for
a
railroad
to
pass
from
louis
or
the
confluence
of
the
mississippi
and
missouri
rivers
through
the
center
of
the
wealth
and
enterprise
of
the
mississippi
valley
to
the
atlantic
with
a
map
of
the
union
before
you
it
will
be
found
to
be
impossible
to
draw
a
line
upon
it
that
would
accommodate
so
large
an
amount
of
population
or
an
equal
extent
of
fertile
country
through
the
broad
bed
of
mountains
that
divide
the
atlantic
from
the
western
states
traversed
by
our
route
for
miles
natural
gorges
are
found
cutting
all
of
them
to
their
bases
except
the
allegheny
which
is
passed
with
comparatively
easy
gradients
and
without
encountering
difficulties
of
a
very
unusual
character
these
favorable
features
of
the
country
give
to
us
a
line
which
is
the
shortest
and
best
that
can
be
obtained
between
these
sections
of
the
union
and
insures
to
the
company
the
whole
of
the
travel
and
light
transportation
with
much
of
the
heavy
trade
destined
to
philadelphia
and
points
north
of
this
city
of
the
vast
region
between
a
line
along
the
southern
shores
of
lake
erie
touching
lake
michigan
and
extending
to
the
far
west
and
the
immediate
valley
of
the
ohio
river
the
distance
from
cleveland
to
new
york
being
miles
shorter
by
this
route
than
by
the
new
york
and
erie
railroad
much
of
the
travel
embarked
upon
the
lakes
for
that
city
from
the
north
and
west
must
also
be
diverted
to
this
line
in
view
of
these
circumstances
can
a
reasonable
doubt
be
entertained
by
any
one
as
to
the
profitableness
of
the
stock
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
its
natural
position
must
give
to
it
more
than
sufficient
business
to
make
it
yield
large
profits
indeed
i
confidently
advance
the
opinion
that
when
the
road
shall
have
been
completed
that
it
will
not
be
a
question
whether
it
will
pay
an
interest
on
its
cost
to
what
point
the
rates
of
freight
and
passage
shall
be
reduced
to
give
the
company
ample
revenues
and
at
the
same
time
make
the
work
most
extensively
useful
to
the
dividends
from
its
revenue
can
be
made
of
or
per
cent
by
changing
the
rates
of
freight
and
passage
at
the
discretion
of
the
directors
from
some
experience
in
the
management
of
the
business
of
other
roads
much
less
favorably
situated
than
this
i
feel
no
hesitation
in
making
this
prediction
i
look
upon
the
result
as
one
upon
which
there
can
be
no
doubt
entertained
the
inquiry
may
be
made
if
this
road
must
prove
a
profitable
investment
why
other
works
in
pennsylvania
favorably
located
have
not
yielded
remunerating
dividends
to
their
proprietors
in
reply
it
can
be
stated
that
there
is
no
important
work
leading
from
philadelphia
that
ought
not
now
to
divide
large
profits
if
their
stock
and
funded
debts
exhibited
a
fair
cash
value
of
the
property
represented
most
if
not
all
of
these
works
were
commenced
with
inadequate
capital
for
the
object
in
view
and
from
the
anxiety
of
the
stockholders
to
realize
the
large
profits
promised
on
their
completion
and
the
to
the
of
the
improvement
they
have
been
pressed
forward
faster
than
true
economy
or
the
funds
of
the
company
would
justify
engagements
were
made
relying
upon
fortune
or
accident
to
provide
the
means
to
meet
them
these
resources
failing
they
were
thrown
upon
the
mercy
of
either
the
contractors
or
the
money
lender
and
in
consequence
the
cost
of
the
works
has
been
rolled
up
to
an
amount
not
anticipated
and
in
many
cases
debts
incurred
under
the
pressure
of
the
moment
in
the
most
objectionable
shape
to
meet
which
the
whole
of
the
receipts
of
the
companies
have
necessarily
been
mortgaged
in
new
england
and
also
in
new
york
where
railroads
have
in
many
cases
been
deprived
of
the
privilege
of
carrying
freight
judiciously
located
roads
have
invariably
paid
well
their
success
has
not
been
caused
by
the
exercise
of
any
peculiar
skill
or
economy
in
their
management
as
generally
supposed
for
in
this
respect
though
they
stand
deservedly
high
there
is
none
that
conduct
their
business
under
all
circumstances
with
as
much
economy
as
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
or
some
other
southern
companies
in
closing

the

are
taken
from

which
appeared
in

newspapers
the
next

hill
at

after
hill
had
been
introduced

warmly
applauded
as
the
empire

who
had
been
intimately
associated
with
the
development
of
the
northern
tier
of
states
from
the
lakes
to
the
pacific
ocean
and
he
had
acknowledged
his
obligation
to
the
indomitable
spirit
of
seattle
and
its
people
he
began
his
address
by
disclaiming
the
ownership
of
the
great
northern
railway
fifteen
thousand
people
own
it
said
he
the
average
holding
is
about
shares
over
women
are
owners
in
the
great
northern

and
i
have
to
manage

then
he
proceeded
it
is
three
years
since
i
was
here
and
i
never
expected
that
three
months
would
pass
without
my
coming
to
seattle
but
three
years
have
passed
and
what
do
i
find
i
think
the
city
in
three
years
has
doubled
i
think
it
has
doubled
in
everything
that
goes
to
make
a
city
just
look
at
the
streets
lined
with
commercial
houses
which
would
be
a
credit
to
any
city
in
the
world
it
is
far
beyond
what
i
expected
to
find
and
i
think
that
seattle
has
a
future
seattle
is
entitled
to
her
growth
and
if
the
same
spirit
that
has
moved
her
citizens
in
the
past
continues
if
the
mantle
of
the
older
men
falls
on
the
shoulders
of
the
younger
men
seattle
can
not
help
but
thrive
you
have
behind
you
one
of
the
richest
states
in
the
union
one
of
the
very
richest
development
of
railways
now
to
come
back
to
the
relation
of
the
railway
to
the
development
of
the
country
next
to
the
cultivation
of
the
soil
itself
in
the
amount
of
money
invested
and
in
the
importance
to
all
the
people
is
the
railway
property
of
this
country
it
is
on
a
little
different
basis
i
am
sorry
to
say
from
the
general
attitude
of
the
public
from
any
other
property
from
what
judge
burke
says
as
to
the
golden
rule
if
you
can
have
it
fairly
applied
it
would
make
our
hearts
glad
we
frequently
hear
about
railroad
watered
stock
it
is
a
hackneyed
phrase
which
is
used
with
which
to
catch
gudgeons
and
it
has
caught
a
great
many
now
let
us
see
you
can
open
a
bank
five
of
us
sitting
here
if
we
had
the
money
could
open
a
bank
put
up
the
building
and
draw
our
checks
and
that
is
disposed
of
we
have
a
million
or
a
million
and
a
half
of
capital
and
conducting
the
business
of
the
bank
within
the
law
applied
to
bankers
we
can
earn
any
dividend
we
like
and
we
can
divide
it
even
up
to
or
per
and
it
has
been
done
and
nobody
finds
any
fault
now
we
might
start
a
manufacturing
establishment
and
we
can
divide
any
profits
that
we
can
legally
make
up
to
or
or
per
or
we
can
start
a
mercantile
establishment
and
conduct
it
so
as
to
bring
any
profit
there
is
no
limit
so
long
as
we
are
within
the
laws
of
trade
but
take
the
railroad
now
remember
you
can
run
your
manufacturing
establishment
hours
a
day
or
you
can
run
it
one
day
in
the
week
or
you
can
run
it
half
the
time
and
you
can
close
it
and
it
will
not
affect
you
or
you
need
not
run
it
at
all
and
if
you
do
not
like
the
business
you
can
dispose
of
it
you
can
liquidate
your
bank
and
go
out
of
business
and
so
with
the
mercantile
establishment
you
can
close
it
at
any
time
but
when
you
have
invested
your
money
in
a
railway
you
have
undertaken
an
obligation
to
serve
the
public
you
have
taken
a
business
risk
that
is
greater
than
the
business
risk
of
any
other
business
in
the
world
if
you
do
not
run
it
move
your
trains
with
regularity
move
your
trains
so
as
to
accommodate
the
business
the
courts
will
appoint
a
receiver
and
will
issue
receiver
certificates
to
an
extent
that
would
wipe
out
your
investment
if
there
were
anything
left
they
would
hand
it
back
but
the
chances
are
altogether
that
if
you
could
not
make
it
pay
the
receiver
could
not
railroad
biggest
risk
now
i
mention
this
simply
to
show
that
the
business
risk
in
building
or
operating
a
railway
is
greater
than
it
is
in
any
other
business
there
is
nothing
guaranteed
and
sometimes
you
are
told
what
appliances
you
may
use
you
are
told
what
you
must
not
use
you
are
told
whom
you
can
hire
and
you
are
told
when
you
can
discharge
him
and
it
has
been
at
least
hinted
as
to
what
you
should
pay
him
what
his
wages
and
condition
of
work
shall
be
so
that
the
only
privilege
that
was
left
for
the
railroads
was
to
pay
the
bills
that
they
are
always
expected
to
do
and
it
would
be
a
great
disappointment
if
they
were
not
able
to
in
the
section
of
this
country
the
portion
of
this
country
east
of
chicago
i
do
not
know
anywhere
north
of
the
ohio
river
where
a
railroad
built
with
the
greatest
care
and
economy
could
pay
one
per
cent
on
its
cost
that
is
a
new
road
built
between
any
of
the
large
cities
of
the
west
to
the
large
cities
of
the
east
paying
the
present
price
of
real
estate
and
terminals
and
the
cost
of
construction
the
cost
of
eliminating
great
profits
the
cost
of
the
necessary
expenditure
of
money
to
make
life
and
limb
safe
take
for
instance
a
railroad
from
new
york
to
chicago
i
had
curiosity
enough
to
inquire
from
the
leading
real
estate
man
who
was
getting
the
additional
property
for
the
new
york
central
their
terminals
what
it
would
cost
from
street
to
harlem
river
a
narrow
strip
of
blocks
on
the
east
side
say
ten
blocks
from
to
street
to
be
used
as
a
terminal
he
told
me
it
ought
to
be
secured
for
but
he
would
not
like
to
take
the
contract
now
follow
that
up
through
albany
and
syracuse
rochester
and
buffalo
and
erie
and
cleveland
and
on
to
chicago
and
if
you
can
get
into
chicago
and
get
out
of
new
york
with
any
reasonable
cost
i
want
to
say
that
when
your
road
was
finished
at
the
present
rate
it
could
not
pay
per
cent
on
what
it
cost
in
money
no
room
for
more
roads
now
what
chance
is
there
for
more
roads
between
new
york
and
chicago
or
between
any
atlantic
city
and
any
large
city
in
the
west
during
the
ten
years
from
to
the
railroad
mileage
in
the
united
states
increased
about
per
the
passenger
business
increased
per
and
the
freight
business
increased
per
cent
the
additional
burden
was
placed
on
the
railways
with
an
increase
of
over
per
cent
in
the
tons
moved
what
is
it
costing
the
pennsylvania
road
to
get
into
the
city
of
new
york
i
do
not
know
the
exact
figures
but
i
have
seen
it
estimated
from
time
to
time
at
one
hundred
millions
of
dollars
to
secure
passenger
facilities
in
the
city
of
new
york
when
i
think
of
these
things
and
see
what
you
have
here
i
think
that
we
have
reason
to
congratulate
ourselves
and
i
think
that
we
had
a
narrow
escape
from
being
compelled
to
do
our
business
west
of
commercial
street
in
place
of
where
we
are
today
there
are
no
places
that
i
know
of
today
where
there
is
any
room
or
any
use
for
any
other
large
railway
enterprise
the
milwaukee
paul
are
coming
to
the
coast
and
we
are
glad
they
are
there
at
different
times
when
people
largely
interested
in
that
enterprise
talked
with
me
i
said
all
means
build
to
the
coast
extend
your
road
if
you
do
not
somebody
who
has
more
enterprise
than
you
will
take
the
business
and
will
keep
it
on
their
own
rails
and
you
will
not
get
a
share
of
it
but
when
that
enterprise
is
finished
i
do
not
know
north
of
the
platte
river
where
there
is
room
for
another
railroad
or
occasion
for
one
there
will
be
branches
built
and
they
are
necessary
for
the
development
of
the
country
you
had
expended
and
there
is
being
expended
now
a
very
large
sum
during
the
last
two
years
the
northern
pacific
and
the
great
northern
within
the
state
of
washington
have
spent
millions
of
dollars
between
portland
and
spokane
it
ought
not
to
frighten
you
it
will
not
wipe
you
out
you
have
your
roots
deep
in
the
ground
and
they
will
stay
there
tacoma
is
waking
now
i
find
in
summing
up
the
present
population
of
the
new
country
between
blaine
and
vancouver
portland
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
columbia
although
fortunately
the
state
line
does
not
limit
our
commerce
or
our
right
to
trade
with
each
other
there
are
over
people
living
on
the
line
of
the
railway
between
blaine
and
vancouver
portland
claims
and
i
feel
sure
that
she
must
be
near
that
figure
portland
has
grown
rapidly
and
i
think
possibly
the
young
men
have
taken
a
sheet
out
of
your
book
there
was
a
time
when
they
were
altogether
too
wealthy
in
portland
every
man
had
business
of
his
own
to
attend
to
and
was
so
deeply
engaged
in
it
that
he
overlooked
the
business
of
the
city
they
did
not
take
hold
you
could
come
there
if
you
were
willing
to
bear
all
the
expense
and
take
what
you
could
get
but
portland
has
had
an
awakening
and
i
believe
that
portland
notwithstanding
its
remoteness
from
the
sea
will
have
a
good
growth
it
has
a
good
country
behind
it
and
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
not
have
a
good
growth
another
city
down
here
where
we
were
beautifully
entertained
last
night
tacoma
i
remember
when
we
came
out
here
they
really
did
not
need
us
and
we
did
not
want
to
force
ourselves
on
them
and
so
we
stayed
right
here
but
i
think
and
i
hope
that
tacoma
is
getting
its
eyes
open
and
that
it
wants
more
railways
we
do
ask
much
we
want
the
privilege
of
a
place
for
foothold
a
place
to
do
our
business
at
our
own
expense
and
i
think
that
we
will
probably
succeed
in
getting
it
i
hope
so
growth
pleases
him
i
wanted
to
come
back
to
your
city
here
i
was
more
than
surprised
at
your
growth
and
i
am
more
than
gratified
i
rather
gathered
that
you
had
grown
fast
and
that
possibly
you
wanted
a
resting
spell
but
i
do
see
that
there
is
any
rest
for
you
now
i
think
that
you
will
go
on
as
you
have
begun
and
i
was
more
than
glad
to
see
what
you
are
doing
in
the
way
of
adjusting
your
street
grades
it
is
inexpensive
the
burden
may
be
hard
upon
some
people
and
difficult
to
carry
but
it
will
cost
infinitely
less
to
do
it
now
than
in
five
or
ten
years
after
those
streets
were
lined
with
buildings
that
had
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
and
you
could
not
afford
to
throw
them
away
lay
your
foundations
right
and
the
structure
will
take
care
of
itself
it
will
grow
by
degrees
and
when
it
is
finished
it
will
be
part
of
a
complete
whole
and
you
will
be
glad
you
did
it
we
have
a
good
many
communities
to
take
care
of
along
our
railway
and
with
every
one
of
them
we
have
always
the
feeling
that
their
prosperity
means
our
prosperity
they
have
to
earn
the
money
before
they
can
pay
it
to
us
and
what
they
do
pay
us
we
think
is
a
small
part
but
we
expect
the
railway
business
must
depend
upon
close
management
and
small
savings
take
the
dividend
of
the
great
northern
railway
copper
cents
in
moving
a
ton
of
freight
ten
miles
pays
our
a
ton
of
freight
on
a
country
road
would
be
a
fair
load
for
a
farmer
wagon
and
ten
miles
would
be
a
fair
day
work
if
he
returned
the
same
night
we
do
that
our
dividend
amounts
to
about
cents
a
little
less
than
three
copper
cents
for
moving
that
load
of
freight
we
find
that
we
have
neither
poisoned
the
air
nor
the
water
and
you
have
all
the
highways
that
you
had
before
we
came
but
we
give
you
a
better
one
and
a
cheaper
one
must
have
money
and
remember
that
you
never
can
injure
the
railway
without
injuring
yourselves
the
railway
has
only
two
sources
from
which
to
get
money
it
must
either
earn
it
or
borrow
it
and
if
it
borrows
and
borrows
judiciously
the
rate
of
interest
ought
not
to
be
high
but
whatever
it
is
high
or
low
you
pay
it
sometimes
people
who
do
not
know
better
think
that
they
are
serving
a
good
cause
to
stick
the
railway
the
company
is
rich
a
personal
injury
case
or
something
of
that
kind
but
it
is
a
railway
and
they
can
afford
it
stick
them
now
who
pays
the
bill
can
we
charge
that
up
to
the
construction
of
a
station
it
is
a
part
of
the
expense
and
the
law
says
that
you
must
pay
us
for
the
use
of
our
property
enough
to
pay
our
expenses
and
our
taxes
and
a
reasonable
return
upon
the
investment
so
that
all
is
charged
in
your
bills
we
had
in
one
thriving
city
on
the
great
northern
i
recall
a
suit
for
a
young
brakeman
stumbled
against
a
pile
of
cinders
that
it
was
represented
the
trackmen
threw
out
from
between
the
rails
and
poured
water
upon
it
and
it
froze
in
the
winter
and
was
solid
and
as
he
was
running
alongside
of
his
train
he
stumbled
and
fell
and
was
injured
some
great
injury
to
the
spine
that
wrecked
his
entire
nervous
system
and
we
inquired
and
found
out
how
the
coal
got
there
and
our
experience
and
education
have
made
us
suspicious
we
took
the
cinders
to
the
laboratory
and
had
them
analyzed
and
absolutely
they
were
anthracite
and
there
never
was
a
ton
of
anthracite
coal
burned
in
a
locomotive
in
the
state
of
minnesota
we
followed
it
up
and
we
found
that
the
man
who
brought
the
suit
a
professional
suit
bringer
had
with
a
brakeman
and
his
own
son
taken
the
cinders
from
his
own
office
and
piled
them
there
and
poured
water
on
them
now
i
speak
of
that
just
as
an
illustration
of
some
applications
of
that
golden
rule
compares
railway
cost
your
future
growth
will
depend
on
yourselves
hereafter
as
it
has
largely
depended
upon
your
own
efforts
in
the
past
the
commerce
going
to
and
from
the
pacific
coast
cities
by
the
sea
is
being
largely
carried
in
foreign
bottoms
there
was
a
time
when
the
american
nation
was
a
nation
of
seafaring
men
but
that
does
not
apply
any
longer
and
i
am
sorry
that
that
is
so
i
believe
that
the
people
of
the
united
states
i
believe
that
the
genius
of
the
country
is
just
as
able
to
carry
upon
the
sea
as
upon
the
land
as
matters
stand
today
any
bay
or
inlet
where
a
foreign
flag
can
force
its
way
inland
into
our
country
they
can
call
to
us
to
drop
the
bundle
and
they
take
it
from
us
and
we
ca
help
ourselves
now
we
ought
to
be
able
to
help
ourselves
for
on
the
land
we
have
so
far
surpassed
the
others
that
there
is
no
comparison
in
great
britain
their
average
railway
cost
is
per
mile
in
the
united
states
it
is
a
little
less
than
per
mile
in
germany
it
is
about
in
france
about
in
austria
about
the
same
now
let
us
see
what
they
do
with
their
two
hundred
and
thousand
dollar
machine
and
their
one
hundred
and
ten
and
one
hundred
and
forty
in
great
britain
they
move
an
average
of
five
hundred
thousand
ton
miles
to
the
mile
of
road
at
a
cost
of
for
every
hundred
miles
in
germany
they
move
about
seven
hundred
thousand
ton
miles
at
a
cost
of
a
trifle
under
for
every
hundred
miles
in
france
ton
miles
at
a
cost
of
for
every
hundred
miles
in
austria
the
cost
is
for
moving
a
ton
of
freight
a
hundred
miles
and
in
the
united
states
the
cost
is
cents
and
a
fraction
against
ship
subsidy
now
we
in
the
united
states
move
the
business
for
less
than
half
the
average
cost
of
europe
we
pay
from
twice
to
four
times
the
rate
of
wages
and
we
do
it
with
an
investment
of
about
a
third
of
their
average
if
we
can
do
that
on
land
why
ca
we
do
it
on
the
sea
i
know
that
if
the
ships
of
the
united
states
had
the
same
care
and
the
same
opportunity
that
the
ships
of
other
nations
have
they
would
do
it
and
until
then
no
subsidy
no
ship
subsidy
will
ever
enable
them
to
compete
with
other
business
because
in
principle
it
is
wrong
to
tax
all
the
business
of
the
country
to
put
your
hand
into
the
public
treasury
and
hand
out
to
one
particular
business
a
cash
subsidy
in
order
that
it
may
live
i
want
to
tell
you
that
a
steamship
line
that
can
not
live
without
a
cash
subsidy
will
make
a
mighty
mighty
lean
race
with
one
it
ought
to
rest
on
a
business
foundation
that
is
the
only
reason
for
running
ships
because
they
can
be
made
to
pay
and
if
we
can
make
our
railways
pay
and
work
at
the
low
rates
that
the
railways
in
the
united
states
do
carry
and
pay
the
scale
of
wages
that
they
do
pay
why
ca
we
succeed
on
the
high
seas
if
we
ca
let
us
hand
that
business
over
to
somebody
who
will
do
it
cheaper
and
better
but
i
do
feel
that
the
case
is
a
hopeless
one
but
on
the
other
hand
i
do
feel
that
it
would
only
limit
the
efforts
of
those
who
were
trying
to
make
and
to
build
up
a
merchant
marine
for
the
united
states
it
would
only
limit
their
efforts
to
extend
a
subsidy
to
a
few
ships
engaged
in
the
business
foreigners
get
subsidy
i
remember
on
one
occasion
that
i
went
home
from
here
and
there
was
no
tonnage
to
move
the
stuff
we
had
to
send
to
the
orient
absolutely
no
tonnage
was
available
and
when
i
got
home
there
was
a
reception
to
one
of
our
public
men
and
the
late
senator
mark
hanna
was
there
i
took
up
in
a
few
remarks
the
question
of
a
subsidy
and
i
said
we
are
going
to
have
one
let
us
pay
a
subsidy
for
something
that
is
going
to
do
us
some
good
let
us
pay
a
tonnage
on
the
actual
products
that
reach
a
new
market
that
would
have
done
some
good
the
tonnage
of
the
products
that
does
not
reach
a
new
market
we
would
have
anything
to
pay
on
that
and
on
that
that
does
we
could
afford
to
pay
now
we
were
driven
out
of
the
business
on
the
atlantic
but
we
might
retain
a
hold
upon
the
business
of
this
ocean
immediately
there
was
a
scheme
for
congress
for
an
appropriation
i
think
of
for
ship
subsidies
and
they
found
that
per
cent
of
it
would
go
to
one
line
under
the
bill
that
was
being
then
drawn
and
that
line
on
the
atlantic
ocean
and
i
know
that
the
men
and
most
of
the
officers
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
and
the
stock
was
owned
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
now
that
would
not
build
up
a
merchant
marine
for
us
a
company
over
there
has
disposed
of
this
old
boat
to
our
people
and
taken
what
new
money
they
got
and
built
new
boats
that
was
all
and
that
was
celebrated
a
portion
of
that
was
celebrated
as
the
inauguration
of
a
new
merchant
marine
for
the
united
states
think
of
it
but
some
of
our
statesmen
were
wise
enough
to
believe
that
it
was
going
to
succeed
but
it
did
not
it
fell
ingloriously
when
we
have
a
merchant
marine
it
will
be
because
there
is
a
reason
for
it
but
until
that
time
comes
just
put
up
with
the
business
that
we
can
get
and
let
the
others
carry
it
who
can
carry
it
lower
and
better
than
we
can
in
this
country
but
bear
this
in
mind
that
all
your
great
harbors
in
the
country
when
compared
with
the
railroad
yards
sink
into
insignificance
in
the
tonnage
that
they
move
i
think
that
in
seattle
i
would
be
safe
in
saying
that
twenty
tons
are
moved
by
rail
where
one
goes
by
water
unless
you
can
count
saw
logs
and
i
had
occasion
to
look
up
louis
the
mississippi
at
louis
has
from
eight
to
twelve
feet
of
water
for
nearly
nine
months
in
the
year
and
boats
run
in
and
out
of
louis
and
we
are
all
anxious
to
make
a
deep
water
channel
from
there
to
new
orleans
now
in
looking
up
the
amount
i
found
that
notwithstanding
they
had
from
eight
to
twelve
feet
of
water
for
nine
months
in
the
year
or
about
nine
months
less
than
per
cent
of
the
tonnage
that
came
into
louis
moved
by
water
and
out
of
over
tons
of
coal
and
if
there
is
any
article
among
all
the
shipments
that
could
be
moved
by
water
easily
and
cheaply
it
would
be
coal
not
one
ton
of
coal
moved
out
of
louis
by
water
last
year
there
is
a
scheme
to
spend
the
public
money
and
create
a
channel
fourteen
feet
deep
to
the
levees
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
and
there
are
plans
to
lath
and
plaster
the
bottoms
of
a
great
many
other
streams
throughout
the
country
and
so
many
that
in
order
to
get
any
appropriation
for
an
enterprise
of
great
national
merit
it
is
necessary
to
divide
up
and
load
it
down
with
a
lot
of
appropriations
these
make
what
is
known
as
the
pork
barrel
the
river
and
harbor
bill
they
load
it
down
with
the
various
enterprises
that
have
no
value
to
anybody
streams
on
which
the
government
is
called
to
spend
more
money
than
all
the
boats
would
bring
if
sold
at
auction
and
in
some
cases
where
there
have
been
no
boats
run
for
ten
years
leads
world
in
tonnage
they
say
they
ought
to
regulate
the
railroads
now
when
you
come
to
consider
the
matter
practically
i
would
rather
have
a
railroad
alongside
of
a
navigable
river
or
a
river
with
six
or
eight
or
ten
feet
of
water
in
it
than
to
have
it
far
away
from
the
river
a
box
car
will
beat
any
channel
in
the
world
but
when
we
get
twenty
or
channels
the
box
car
is
not
in
it
in
bulky
freight
you
have
got
to
have
depth
of
water
some
years
ago
i
built
six
freight
steamers
on
the
great
lakes
and
they
were
considered
whales
in
their
day
they
could
carry
tons
today
a
lake
steamer
and
a
double
channel
through
the
soo
canal
carries
tons
and
has
two
additional
firemen
and
one
deckhand
and
that
is
all
the
additional
crew
sometime
i
would
like
to
have
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
seattle
if
they
had
the
time
run
down
to
the
head
of
lake
superior
and
see
what
is
the
greatest
port
in
the
matter
of
tons
moved
in
the
world
london
was
and
duluth
and
superior
a
few
years
ago
were
trailing
along
fifth
or
sixth
place
but
last
year
it
took
first
place
with
the
cities
of
the
world
and
it
handled
more
tonnage
than
any
other
city
london
had
tons
and
duluth
had
now
to
show
the
enormous
importance
of
that
load
of
tonnage
that
tonnage
that
is
greater
than
any
other
city
in
the
world
i
undertake
to
say
and
do
say
that
there
are
not
people
men
women
and
children
connected
directly
or
indirectly
with
moving
that
traffic
between
the
land
and
the
water
in
both
directions
there
is
such
a
thing
as
doing
a
very
large
business
without
a
harbor
at
all
seattle
spirit
wins
although
as
far
as
foreign
commerce
is
concerned
as
far
as
business
is
concerned
when
we
get
to
the
seaside
we
have
to
hand
it
over
to
the
ships
it
must
be
done
but
the
great
business
is
done
in
the
railroad
yards
i
would
not
be
without
the
harbor
far
from
it
but
do
feel
that
the
harbor
is
going
to
make
you
and
do
feel
as
a
gentleman
in
public
life
in
washington
when
a
friend
of
mine
talking
with
him
said
wo
get
any
more
railways
built
along
the
policies
you
advocate
well
he
said
have
got
them
we
have
got
them
and
he
was
a
member
of
the
house
committee
of
interstate
commerce
a
rather
dangerous
statement
for
him
to
make
at
tacoma
in
his
address
at
the
banquet
of
the
tacoma
chamber
of
commerce
on
the
preceding
evening
november
hill
dwelt
especially
on
the
intimate
relation
of
railway
and
agriculture
interests
among
other
things
he
said
the
question
of
terminals
means
a
great
deal
to
a
railroad
and
it
is
getting
to
be
more
and
more
full
of
meaning
every
year
some
cities
and
large
cities
today
have
all
the
railroads
they
will
ever
get
simply
on
account
of
the
difficulty
in
getting
terminals
i
think
the
northern
pacific
terminals
today
i
think
to
buy
them
on
the
entire
system
would
cost
more
money
than
to
grade
the
whole
road
and
i
do
not
know
but
what
it
would
cost
more
than
to
grade
and
put
the
rails
down
that
is
a
condition
and
remember
that
you
pay
the
freight
will
soon
need
all
the
wheat
we
raise
within
a
comparatively
short
time
i
will
say
that
within
six
years
i
will
go
on
record
you
wo
send
many
cargoes
of
wheat
from
tacoma
by
sea
simply
because
the
united
states
wants
every
bushel
that
will
be
raised
within
the
united
states
to
feed
her
own
people
and
will
pay
you
more
money
for
it
if
they
did
pay
you
more
money
for
it
it
would
go
to
the
foreigner
but
our
own
people
will
pay
more
money
for
it
and
take
it
somewhere
and
grind
it
into
flour
if
you
look
for
greater
avenues
or
greater
economy
in
transportation
but
it
will
cease
to
go
out
as
wheat
i
will
give
you
an
illustration
and
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusions
as
well
as
i
can
in
the
united
slates
raised
bushels
of
wheat
and
we
had
people
and
we
exported
somewhere
between
and
bushels
years
later
in
we
raised
bushels
we
increased
in
that
years
a
little
less
than
per
cent
in
our
wheat
yield
or
bushels
our
population
increased
per
and
converging
lines
meet
somewhere
now
if
we
had
of
people
and
we
have
between
and
this
year
and
use
six
and
a
half
bushels
per
capita
it
would
take
bushels
for
bread
and
seed
professor
rogers
of
the
minnesota
agricultural
college
puts
our
consumption
for
bread
and
seed
for
the
last
few
years
at
a
trifle
over
or
a
trifle
under
seven
bushels
i
think
he
uses
ten
years
for
his
average
and
i
use
to
get
an
average
of
about
six
bushels
and
forty
pounds
and
i
call
it
six
and
bushels
on
last
year
crop
with
we
have
had
about
bushels
to
sell
and
we
sold
about
what
is
the
result
after
the
of
january
wheat
was
higher
in
minneapolis
than
it
was
in
chicago
even
up
to
the
first
of
august
and
part
of
the
time
it
was
higher
than
it
was
in
new
york
because
they
wanted
it
to
make
a
loaf
of
bread
to
feed
our
people
at
home
we
have
not
the
great
margin
that
we
used
to
have
the
seed
on
last
year
crop
went
down
to
bushels
and
if
my
figures
are
equal
to
professor
rogers
and
he
is
a
professor
of
agriculture
in
the
agricultural
college
and
maybe
he
has
more
time
to
look
these
questions
up
more
carefully
but
with
his
figures
we
had
a
bushel
to
sell
suppose
we
had
bushels
to
sell
and
we
are
increasing
in
population
at
the
rate
of
per
year
our
natural
figure
is
between
and
and
allow
for
immigration
not
eleven
twelve
thirteen
or
fourteen
as
we
have
been
having
but
say
seven
and
by
you
will
have
in
the
united
states
it
figures
out
to
be
accurate
but
suppose
we
have
it
might
come
by
or
or
it
might
be
in
but
about
that
time
we
will
have
people
and
if
they
use
six
and
a
half
bushels
per
capita
for
bread
and
seed
it
would
take
bushels
to
feed
them
problem
of
the
wheat
that
is
a
little
more
than
twice
what
you
are
raising
today
and
you
have
any
new
fields
to
put
a
new
plow
in
from
when
we
raised
bushels
of
wheat
following
that
time
more
than
half
of
minnesota
all
the
northern
part
of
minnesota
was
brought
under
the
plow
all
of
north
dakota
all
of
south
dakota
all
of
the
state
of
washington
and
all
of
oregon
except
or
bushels
raised
in
more
than
half
of
california
or
in
kansas
and
nebraska
a
large
part
practically
all
of
oklahoma
or
the
indian
territory
and
a
large
part
of
texas
and
take
what
was
raised
in
on
the
new
fields
that
were
opened
up
any
new
territory
after
and
you
will
find
that
it
is
approaching
bushels
but
the
increase
in
the
whole
country
in
that
years
was
only
bushels
so
that
the
old
fields
fell
off
about
bushels
are
we
increasing
our
yield
per
acre
by
no
manner
of
means
it
has
been
a
steady
and
uniform
decline
for
the
past
thirty
years
now
we
have
as
good
wheat
fields
as
there
are
anywhere
on
the
continent
and
they
will
be
made
better
i
am
not
a
disciple
of
malthus
because
malthus
was
an
honest
man
no
doubt
but
when
he
wrote
he
did
not
understand
the
science
of
modern
agriculture
or
the
adaptation
of
the
soil
or
of
the
seed
to
the
soil
or
the
commercial
value
of
a
correct
analysis
of
the
soil
and
the
adaptation
of
the
soil
nor
its
commercial
value
as
suited
to
the
crop
it
is
best
fitted
for
all
these
things
we
have
learned
and
while
you
are
teaching
your
young
people
let
me
advise
you
that
the
school
that
is
most
entitled
to
your
care
and
the
school
that
will
do
the
most
for
the
state
in
every
place
and
will
turn
out
men
and
women
as
they
have
always
in
industry
and
intelligence
and
everything
else
that
goes
to
make
good
citizenship
the
school
attended
by
the
boy
on
the
farm
is
certainly
as
good
as
the
best
when
your
forests
are
cut
and
hauled
away
and
sold
to
somebody
else
you
have
then
and
we
will
give
you
a
perennial
forest
a
crop
every
year
of
great
value
too
but
we
ought
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
our
land
and
we
will
i
have
no
doubt
about
the
future
we
will
do
what
other
people
have
been
compelled
to
do
in
great
britain
was
down
to
fourteen
bushels
we
are
down
to
thirteen
and
now
average
they
took
the
question
up
and
it
was
much
easier
for
them
to
control
as
far
as
territory
was
concerned
because
the
territory
was
small
in
the
hands
of
a
few
land
owners
mostly
rented
and
they
faced
conditions
compelling
the
land
owner
to
and
fertilize
and
carry
one
crop
year
after
year
they
appointed
a
royal
commission
and
that
royal
commission
went
to
work
jointly
we
have
a
royal
commission
too
and
they
are
able
men
one
is
a
professor
at
cornell
and
another
is
a
publisher
of
books
in
new
york
and
another
is
pinchot
who
is
doing
a
great
deal
of
work
but
he
is
overrun
with
the
work
he
has
to
do
this
commission
is
to
report
in
time
for
the
meeting
of
congress
now
bear
this
in
mind
great
britain
started
in
trying
to
keep
the
people
on
the
land
the
landlord
was
afraid
of
the
great
drift
of
the
agricultural
people
to
the
colonies
and
the
new
republic
the
united
states
at
that
time
the
new
republic
was
going
to
impoverish
them
and
leave
them
without
any
rent
rolls
they
went
to
work
intelligently
and
in
and
sir
humphrey
david
the
foremost
scientist
of
his
time
delivered
most
intelligent
lectures
on
the
qualities
of
the
soil
in
forty
or
fifty
years
after
they
started
they
had
gotten
their
yield
up
to
an
average
of
bushels
per
acre
last
year
it
was
starting
at
fourteen
we
ought
to
get
up
in
place
of
or
we
ought
to
be
able
to
get
up
to
or
and
if
we
do
we
will
have
grain
to
feed
our
people
and
to
spare
and
what
do
i
hear
more
and
then
some
now
in
going
over
those
questions
i
am
not
worrying
about
the
future
of
the
country
i
have
more
confidence
in
it
today
the
day
for
cheap
wheat
has
left
the
united
states
not
to
return
and
we
can
stand
that
this
land
this
side
of
the
range
you
can
devote
to
better
uses
than
raising
wheat
i
do
not
know
why
you
should
not
get
returns
as
i
said
that
would
equal
per
cent
on
per
acre
you
can
do
it
there
is
no
question
as
to
that
southern
railways
and
their
needs
by
john
wallace
abstract
of
address
before
southern
commercial
congress
washington
and
this
question
has
been
extensively
treated
by
leading
railroad
men
statesmen
and
press
of
the
south
and
admirably
covered
by
addresses
on
numerous
occasions
before
various
audiences
throughout
the
south
i
therefore
feel
that
the
southern
railroad
situation
is
gradually
becoming
better
understood
not
only
by
the
public
at
large
but
by
the
railway
men
of
the
south
who
are
jointly
appreciative
of
the
fact
that
the
greatest
need
of
southern
railroads
is
the
confidence
and
support
of
the
communities
through
which
they
run
and
serve
therefore
my
remarks
will
be
few
and
are
made
in
order
that
certain
fundamentals
may
be
read
into
the
record
of
this
convention
for
the
purposes
of
this
address
the
south
is
described
as
that
portion
of
the
united
states
lying
south
of
the
potomac
and
ohio
rivers
and
east
of
the
mississippi
shortly
after
the
close
of
the
civil
war
the
south
realizing
the
changed
order
of
things
accepted
the
situation
in
the
spirit
of
american
manhood
and
started
on
a
new
era
of
industrial
and
commercial
development
one
of
the
first
necessities
was
a
comprehensive
system
of
transportation
facilities
the
railroads
which
prior
to
the
civil
war
had
compared
favorably
with
those
in
the
north
at
its
close
were
practically
bankrupt
financially
and
physically
and
were
more
the
shadow
than
the
substance
of
what
they
should
have
been
southerners
with
brains
and
energy
starting
with
miles
of
detached
dilapidated
and
crippled
railways
immediately
commenced
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
present
industrial
and
commercial
prosperity
in
the
south
by
constructing
its
lines
of
railway
the
efforts
of
these
men
and
the
confidence
they
were
able
to
inspire
in
northern
and
foreign
capital
are
best
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
today
the
south
is
served
with
miles
of
railroad
serving
eleven
states
twenty
million
people
and
representing
a
total
investment
in
round
numbers
of
two
billion
dollars
of
these
miles
of
railroads
only
miles
approximately
or
percent
are
double
track
it
is
possible
that
the
next
ten
years
will
see
at
least
or
over
ten
thousand
additional
miles
of
second
track
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
while
transportation
is
the
burden
bearer
of
both
production
and
commerce
it
is
only
able
to
perform
the
full
and
complete
measure
of
its
functions
when
properly
nourished
and
assisted
by
finance
in
ancient
days
the
birth
of
civilization
started
with
the
ability
to
preserve
food
products
this
grew
from
the
temporary
necessity
of
accumulating
sufficient
food
to
last
from
one
chase
to
another
or
to
enable
journeys
to
be
performed
or
winter
climates
endured
to
the
storage
of
vast
quantities
of
food
to
enable
nations
to
survive
years
of
famine
as
was
exemplified
by
the
storage
of
grain
in
egypt
in
the
days
of
joseph
which
period
history
shows
us
was
the
crowning
epoch
of
egyptian
civilization
today
the
measure
of
our
modern
civilization
is
our
transportation
facilities
safe
efficient
and
rapid
communication
and
the
economy
of
the
world
transportation
systems
are
binding
the
nations
of
the
earth
closer
together
day
by
day
and
helping
to
create
the
conditions
which
will
ultimately
place
the
crown
of
accomplishment
upon
our
modern
civilization
coming
back
to
the
south
from
which
we
have
been
temporarily
led
astray
it
is
to
the
careful
observer
that
all
the
diverse
interests
of
this
section
agriculture
mining
manufacture
commerce
and
banking
are
unavoidably
and
irrevocably
bound
up
with
the
transportation
facilities
furnished
and
to
be
furnished
by
the
railway
systems
ramifying
its
territory
and
performing
a
service
for
the
south
similar
to
that
performed
by
the
arteries
and
in
the
body
of
corporeal
man
it
is
also
apparent
to
the
impartial
observer
that
if
the
south
is
to
reach
its
highest
state
of
development
its
transportation
facilities
should
not
lag
but
should
lead
the
march
of
progress
and
that
this
development
should
be
stimulated
in
every
possible
way
and
men
of
the
south
should
never
forget
for
a
single
moment
that
needs
of
the
railroads
are
the
needs
of
the
it
has
been
our
custom
in
america
to
anticipate
future
needs
in
transportation
and
in
a
measure
attempt
to
forestall
and
provide
for
them
the
policy
of
foreign
countries
has
been
practically
the
reverse
the
railway
systems
of
england
have
been
constructed
to
take
care
of
and
supply
a
demand
for
transportation
facilities
that
already
existed
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
in
the
south
and
west
have
been
projected
and
constructed
and
to
a
great
extent
financed
by
men
whose
inspiration
was
a
firm
belief
in
an
unseen
future
and
whose
assets
were
largely
composed
of
hope
and
an
undying
faith
in
the
future
development
of
their
country
now
the
future
demands
for
increased
transportation
facilities
in
the
south
are
plainly
indicated
by
past
records
showing
the
growth
of
productive
activities
and
the
constant
increase
of
tonnage
to
be
moved
if
these
requirements
are
to
be
met
demand
and
supply
must
move
forward
hand
in
hand
additional
tonnage
will
justify
increased
facilities
and
increased
facilities
will
stimulate
still
greater
tonnage
during
the
past
years
the
total
products
of
the
south
from
agriculture
forest
mines
and
manufactures
have
increased
in
valuation
over
per
cent
during
the
last
five
years
of
this
period
ending
in
the
increase
has
been
per
cent
the
common
fallacy
that
a
railroad
is
completed
when
opened
for
traffic
has
long
since
passed
away
at
least
in
the
minds
of
intelligent
men
the
railroad
of
today
is
no
sooner
completed
as
a
single
track
than
it
becomes
necessary
to
provide
industrial
spurs
additional
or
enlarged
terminals
replace
its
temporary
structures
by
permanent
ones
widen
its
excavations
strengthen
its
embankments
provide
passing
tracks
additional
shop
facilities
enlarged
passenger
and
freight
stations
warehouses
elevators
docks
and
wharves
at
water
terminals
additional
tracks
heavier
rail
rock
ballast
elimination
of
curves
reduction
of
grades
block
signals
elimination
of
grade
crossings
heavier
engines
larger
and
better
cars
to
the
end
that
the
constantly
growing
requirements
and
exactions
of
modern
traffic
conditions
may
be
met
all
of
which
requires
increased
expenditures
which
it
is
easily
seen
could
not
in
any
event
be
provided
for
out
of
earnings
during
the
next
ten
years
the
railroads
of
the
south
will
require
to
enable
them
to
fully
provide
for
the
increased
demands
for
transportation
facilities
an
average
of
per
annum
including
the
estimated
increased
mileage
and
the
present
capital
investment
the
resulting
average
capitalization
would
amount
to
per
mile
being
per
mile
under
the
present
average
capitalization
of
all
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
today
which
is
per
mile
b
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
railroad
situation
in
the
south
by
the
expenditure
of
a
round
billion
dollars
during
the
next
ten
years
as
outlined
herein
would
make
the
total
investment
in
southern
railways
at
the
end
of
that
period
three
billions
of
dollars
on
an
estimated
mileage
of
it
would
require
average
earnings
of
gross
per
mile
per
annum
with
operating
expenses
at
per
cent
of
the
gross
to
yield
sufficient
net
income
to
provide
a
return
of
per
cent
on
this
total
investment
when
these
figures
are
compared
with
the
present
average
gross
earnings
of
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
per
mile
per
annum
with
an
average
cost
of
operation
of
per
annum
resulting
in
a
ratio
of
operating
expenses
to
gross
earnings
of
per
cent
the
above
estimates
appear
reasonable
and
conservative
even
if
this
expenditure
is
made
and
the
results
predicted
obtained
at
the
end
of
the
period
southern
railroads
will
still
fall
approximately
per
cent
short
of
yielding
the
present
average
gross
earnings
per
mile
per
annum
of
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
today
to
provide
funds
to
meet
these
and
incessant
demands
for
additional
facilities
the
railroad
companies
must
necessarily
be
large
borrowers
the
prosperity
of
the
south
in
the
next
decade
and
in
those
to
follow
after
depends
upon
the
ability
of
the
owners
and
managers
of
southern
railways
to
foresee
and
provide
for
future
necessities
and
upon
the
promptness
with
which
the
work
is
accomplished
the
ability
of
railroads
to
construct
these
improvements
which
are
so
essential
to
the
future
prosperity
of
the
south
depends
upon
the
willingness
of
capital
to
furnish
the
necessary
funds
for
the
purpose
while
legislation
may
control
and
regulate
the
returns
upon
invested
capital
there
is
no
process
by
which
it
can
compel
that
investment
originally
while
investment
is
easily
retarded
it
is
difficult
to
attract
there
is
probably
no
form
of
capital
investment
more
open
to
attack
or
more
liable
to
depreciation
through
unfair
or
unwise
legislation
than
the
railway
investments
of
today
while
the
speaker
is
a
firm
believer
in
the
principles
of
governmental
control
and
supervision
over
the
corporate
entities
which
have
been
created
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
every
shield
has
its
reverse
and
that
the
exercise
of
such
control
and
supervision
must
necessarily
be
along
the
lines
of
right
and
justice
which
no
mere
legislative
enactment
can
change
any
variance
brings
its
own
reward
which
frequently
spells
disaster
the
power
to
control
regulate
and
supervise
necessarily
carries
with
it
responsibilities
from
which
there
can
be
no
escape
every
tax
every
restriction
every
requirement
which
costs
money
or
reduces
revenue
to
our
southern
railroads
is
a
tax
which
must
ultimately
be
paid
by
the
communities
which
they
serve
the
prosperity
of
the
southern
railroads
and
the
prosperity
of
the
south
are
irrevocably
bound
together
and
the
of
the
south
are
identical
with
the
needs
of
the
the
basis
of
securing
capital
must
necessarily
be
the
ability
of
the
borrower
to
inspire
confidence
in
the
lender
that
his
capital
will
ultimately
be
returned
to
him
intact
and
that
he
will
receive
regularly
and
promptly
adequate
hire
therefor
no
section
of
our
great
country
has
such
reputation
for
united
action
as
the
south
in
political
matters
this
unity
of
action
for
years
has
led
to
the
designation
the
solid
south
what
the
railroads
in
this
section
need
today
is
solid
south
behind
and
beneath
a
solid
south
taking
a
calm
and
rational
view
of
the
immense
factor
the
railways
have
been
and
always
will
be
in
the
development
of
its
future
greatness
the
recent
reversion
of
sentiment
in
the
state
of
georgia
brought
about
by
a
calm
and
deliberate
analysis
of
the
present
situation
by
the
business
men
of
that
state
should
be
the
keynote
of
the
future
action
of
the
solid
south
adoption
of
a
policy
of
fairness
and
liberality
towards
the
railroad
interests
on
behalf
of
all
the
southern
states
and
the
ability
to
convince
the
financial
world
that
this
action
is
sincere
and
genuine
and
will
be
permanent
is
the
great
paramount
need
of
the
railroads
of
the
south
prompt
action
along
these
lines
will
enable
the
railroad
companies
of
this
section
to
successfully
compete
in
the
markets
of
the
world
for
the
capital
needed
to
carry
out
the
improvements
outlined
and
thus
provide
the
facilities
which
will
enable
the
producers
of
the
south
to
ride
the
crest
of
the
wave
of
coming
prosperity
in
its
calls
for
capital
the
southern
railroads
must
come
into
competition
in
the
markets
of
the
world
not
only
with
the
railroad
requirements
of
the
north
of
the
east
and
the
west
but
with
all
the
lines
of
human
industry
and
endeavor
throughout
the
wide
world
the
difference
between
the
five
or
six
per
cent
paid
by
southern
railroads
for
the
money
which
goes
into
their
additional
facilities
or
equipment
and
the
three
or
four
per
cent
which
may
be
yielded
by
the
world
investments
is
merely
the
gauge
by
which
the
confidence
of
the
capitalist
is
measured
in
the
integrity
of
his
investments
today
it
is
difficult
to
secure
money
for
railroad
development
either
south
or
north
at
any
ordinary
rate
of
interest
why
is
it
because
money
is
scarce
no
i
can
best
answer
this
by
a
story
of
the
panic
of
when
a
citizen
of
chicago
dropped
into
the
office
of
lyman
gage
of
the
first
national
bank
of
that
city
and
inquired
of
gage
if
money
was
tight
he
replied
no
the
bank
had
plenty
of
money
the
citizen
said
that
fine
can
i
secure
a
loan
of
gage
replied
yes
you
can
have
it
we
will
loan
it
to
you
what
is
your
collateral
what
security
can
you
give
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
loan
was
not
made
the
customer
afterwards
remarked
to
a
friend
that
he
had
found
that
the
trouble
was
not
that
money
was
tight
or
that
money
was
scarce
but
was
due
to
the
scarcity
of
collateral
or
security
which
is
only
another
designation
for
guaranteed
confidence
this
is
the
situation
today
there
is
not
a
railroad
in
the
south
north
east
or
west
that
could
not
secure
all
of
the
funds
necessary
for
any
development
it
might
desire
to
make
provided
it
could
show
the
capitalists
to
whom
application
for
the
loan
was
made
that
it
could
furnish
security
which
would
insure
the
repayment
of
the
loan
and
the
interest
thereon
as
due
i
doubt
if
there
is
a
single
southern
railway
system
the
officers
of
which
would
not
gladly
today
take
up
consider
and
block
out
a
scheme
for
the
improvement
and
betterment
of
their
property
and
commence
preparations
to
enable
their
system
to
fully
perform
the
increased
functions
of
a
common
carrier
which
the
abundant
years
of
the
immediate
future
promise
to
require
if
they
could
be
sure
and
in
turn
could
assure
their
financial
backers
that
the
earnings
of
their
road
would
be
amply
and
safely
sufficient
to
provide
for
and
take
care
of
the
investment
necessary
therefore
that
the
needs
of
the
railroads
are
the
needs
of
the
i
presume
there
is
no
planter
miner
manufacturer
producer
of
any
sort
banker
merchant
or
professional
man
in
the
wide
south
who
would
not
say
in
a
moment
that
every
thousand
dollars
of
capital
invested
in
his
vicinity
or
in
his
town
or
in
his
state
would
be
gladly
welcomed
and
eagerly
sought
for
by
the
planter
paying
eight
per
cent
and
the
merchant
and
miscellaneous
producer
from
six
to
eight
per
cent
and
that
approximately
one
billion
of
dollars
injected
into
the
commercial
channels
of
the
southern
states
during
the
next
ten
years
would
bring
a
relative
measure
of
prosperity
to
every
man
woman
and
child
within
its
borders
when
it
is
considered
that
this
amount
of
money
could
be
invested
in
additional
railroad
improvements
and
facilities
that
under
proper
conditions
it
could
be
secured
at
a
rate
not
in
excess
of
five
per
cent
that
approximately
eighty
per
cent
or
more
would
be
spent
for
southern
labor
and
southern
material
and
would
find
its
way
through
every
artery
and
vein
of
southern
trade
and
commerce
it
would
seem
that
the
solid
south
would
be
thoroughly
alive
to
the
burning
fact
that
needs
of
the
railroads
are
the
needs
of
the
i
might
talk
to
you
for
hours
about
the
evil
and
unfairness
of
legislative
enactments
to
retard
and
make
unproductive
railway
investments
of
the
injustice
of
any
body
of
men
attempting
by
legislation
without
giving
the
railroad
corporations
proper
hearing
to
arbitrarily
adjust
their
rates
of
toll
for
either
passenger
or
freight
simply
because
politicians
consider
it
a
popular
thing
to
do
i
might
suggest
a
multitude
of
things
which
could
be
done
to
increase
the
credit
of
railroads
throughout
your
section
i
might
mention
a
multitude
of
things
which
have
been
done
to
injure
and
impair
and
prevent
railroads
securing
the
necessary
capital
to
provide
for
their
needs
i
might
also
attempt
to
enumerate
the
actions
of
railroad
managers
and
employees
toward
the
public
i
might
expatiate
upon
the
foolishness
and
unwisdom
of
a
corporation
the
creature
of
the
public
attempting
to
dictate
to
its
master
or
declining
to
obey
its
commands
it
is
doubtful
however
if
the
enumeration
of
the
errors
and
shortcomings
of
the
of
the
same
family
ever
tends
to
a
better
understanding
or
more
harmonious
relationships
the
need
of
the
hour
is
a
recognition
of
the
interdependent
relations
which
exist
between
us
all
and
to
remember
intensely
actively
potently
remember
that
an
injury
to
one
is
an
injury
to
all
and
that
united
we
stand
divided
we
fall

daniel
willard
president
of
the
baltimore
ohio
railroad
an
address
delivered
at
galesburg
illinois
to
burlington
railroad
employes
february
by
willard
then
second
of
the
chicago
burlington
quincy
railroad
company
a
short
time
ago
i
had
occasion
to
explain
to
some
of
your
associates
who
happened
to
be
in
my
office
some
of
the
difficulties
the
railroads
had
been
contending
with
during
the
two
years
just
past
and
i
was
asked
if
i
would
be
willing
to
come
to
galesburg
and
explain
to
other
burlington
employes
the
things
i
had
endeavored
to
make
clear
to
them
i
replied
that
i
would
be
very
glad
to
do
so
and
i
suppose
that
is
how
i
happen
to
be
here
tonight
i
understand
that
this
audience
is
composed
largely
of
employes
of
the
burlington
railroad
company
and
i
am
glad
that
that
is
so
and
what
i
shall
say
will
be
addressed
particularly
to
them
so
much
has
been
said
and
written
about
railroads
during
the
last
two
years
and
by
many
well
qualified
to
do
both
as
well
as
by
some
not
qualified
to
do
either
that
it
can
hardly
be
possible
that
any
new
thing
remains
to
be
said
and
i
fear
i
shall
only
be
able
this
evening
to
repeat
to
you
collectively
the
same
things
i
have
already
said
to
many
of
you
individually
under
the
burlington
plan
of
organization
the
second
has
direct
charge
of
the
operation
of
the
line
responsible
of
course
to
the
president
and
for
the
last
five
years
i
have
had
the
privilege
and
honor
of
holding
that
office
i
refer
to
this
only
that
i
may
by
so
doing
establish
my
relationship
with
the
various
matters
to
which
i
shall
later
specifically
refer
because
i
propose
to
confine
my
remarks
chiefly
to
home
matters
that
is
to
say
to
matters
pertaining
directly
to
the
burlington
company
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
be
qualified
to
speak
clearly
on
that
subject
and
while
i
have
naturally
read
much
concerning
the
general
railroad
question
as
a
whole
the
same
sources
of
information
have
also
been
open
to
you
i
have
no
doubt
many
of
you
have
given
the
general
subject
as
much
or
even
more
study
than
i
have
in
october
months
ago
the
burlington
company
did
the
largest
business
in
its
entire
history
ran
the
most
trains
earned
the
most
money
and
employed
the
most
men
during
that
month
the
names
of
men
appeared
upon
its
and
the
same
condition
existed
quite
generally
throughout
the
entire
united
states
there
was
a
universal
complaint
of
car
shortage
and
lack
of
motive
power
four
months
later
reports
from
the
car
efficiency
bureau
in
chicago
showed
a
surplus
of
over
freight
cars
on
the
american
railroads
in
the
meantime
the
burlington
company
had
reduced
its
force
by
nearly
men
and
it
was
estimated
that
the
transportation
business
of
the
country
had
fallen
off
more
than
per
cent
what
caused
this
unprecedented
change
men
far
abler
than
i
have
undertaken
to
explain
and
many
reasons
have
been
given
all
i
presume
more
or
less
in
harmony
with
the
facts
but
influenced
no
doubt
by
each
man
point
of
view
i
say
candidly
i
do
not
know
what
caused
it
that
is
assuming
that
there
any
one
but
i
think
i
can
point
out
to
you
of
the
causes
at
least
so
far
as
the
burlington
company
is
concerned
a
railroad
as
you
all
well
know
is
a
living
growing
thing
it
is
never
finished
or
if
we
think
we
have
finished
some
certain
part
as
was
probably
thought
when
the
original
stone
engine
houses
were
built
here
some
years
ago
or
when
the
first
bridge
was
built
across
the
mississippi
river
at
burlington
it
always
happens
that
heavier
larger
and
longer
engines
come
along
in
course
of
time
forced
upon
us
by
the
changed
conditions
and
our
engine
house
which
was
built
for
all
time
becomes
too
short
and
our
bridge
is
too
light
and
both
must
be
rebuilt
the
same
thing
is
going
on
in
every
department
of
railroad
operations
ballast
ties
rails
coaches
station
buildings
even
grades
and
curvature
all
come
within
the
changing
influence
of
time
and
progress
i
referred
to
the
engine
house
specifically
simply
to
illustrate
my
point
because
of
the
constant
change
or
evolution
which
is
going
on
it
is
necessary
that
railroad
companies
if
they
expect
to
keep
abreast
of
the
times
should
make
annually
large
expenditures
for
such
improvements
as
from
time
to
time
become
desirable
or
necessary
if
the
standard
of
service
is
to
be
raised
or
even
maintained
these
are
called
extraordinary
expenditures
and
it
is
customary
on
this
line
to
prepare
each
year
as
of
january
what
is
called
a
budget
being
in
effect
a
list
of
the
more
important
improvements
considered
necessary
by
the
officers
of
the
road
the
budget
shows
the
separate
items
with
description
of
each
and
also
estimated
cost
it
may
and
does
include
such
items
as
new
cars
or
engines
needed
additional
sidetracks
new
terminal
yards
such
as
you
have
here
water
treating
plants
new
coal
chutes
etc
on
january
the
sum
total
of
the
burlington
budget
as
it
stood
approved
by
the
president
on
that
date
amounted
to
something
over
it
included
some
new
equipment
and
also
some
quite
large
improvements
such
as
new
yard
at
lincoln
grade
reductions
between
galesburg
and
savanna
etc
the
burlington
system
is
over
miles
in
length
and
goes
through
parts
of
eleven
different
states
on
the
of
january
the
legislatures
in
all
of
the
eleven
states
i
think
were
in
session
the
federal
congress
was
also
in
session
at
washington
bills
having
special
reference
to
railroads
were
being
introduced
daily
in
some
of
the
legislative
bodies
above
mentioned
i
can
not
say
now
that
all
of
them
were
against
the
railroads
but
i
feel
i
am
justified
in
saying
that
while
perhaps
some
of
them
if
passed
might
not
have
injured
the
railroads
much
none
or
at
most
very
few
were
intended
to
help
the
roads
in
fact
the
attitude
of
the
federal
congress
as
well
as
of
most
of
the
state
legislatures
was
considered
by
nearly
all
railroad
owners
and
officers
as
well
as
distinctly
hostile
this
belief
may
or
may
not
have
been
justified
by
the
facts
at
any
rate
it
existed
the
owners
of
the
burlington
company
believed
it
its
executive
officers
believed
it
i
believed
it
the
number
of
bills
affecting
railroads
introduced
in
the
legislatures
of
the
eleven
states
above
referred
to
and
in
the
federal
congress
during
the
session
of
winter
of
was
over
at
least
over
such
bills
were
actually
laid
upon
my
desk
among
these
were
bills
reducing
the
passenger
fares
in
several
states
others
about
reciprocal
demurrage
if
any
one
can
explain
how
such
a
matter
can
be
made
reciprocal
still
others
fixing
the
speed
of
stock
trains
and
the
size
of
caboose
cars
fixing
the
hours
of
labor
for
men
in
certain
branches
of
the
service
and
i
wish
to
say
here
that
that
part
of
the
federal
law
fixing
limit
of
hours
for
men
in
train
and
engine
service
has
my
hearty
support
bills
having
reference
to
the
liability
of
the
railroads
to
their
patrons
and
employes
etc
i
do
not
wish
you
to
understand
that
i
criticise
all
or
for
that
matter
any
of
the
bills
by
this
enumeration
i
am
now
simply
reciting
the
facts
but
whether
the
bills
were
good
or
bad
desirable
or
undesirable
it
was
clear
if
some
of
them
became
laws
that
the
expenses
of
the
railroads
would
in
consequence
be
largely
increased
and
no
way
was
provided
whereby
the
revenue
or
earnings
would
be
correspondingly
raised
in
fact
there
seemed
to
be
a
demand
from
all
directions
that
rates
should
be
reduced
and
they
were
reduced
in
many
states
another
important
movement
was
also
under
way
at
the
same
time
and
that
was
in
the
direction
of
a
general
wage
increase
in
practically
all
departments
this
one
item
alone
cost
the
burlington
company
a
year
now
what
effect
do
you
suppose
all
these
things
had
upon
the
budget
and
similar
questions
just
the
same
effect
that
the
same
kind
of
questions
in
a
personal
way
would
have
had
upon
you
and
your
personal
affairs
you
will
remember
that
i
said
the
budget
amounted
to
on
january
that
was
just
before
this
wave
of
legislation
referred
to
had
fully
developed
but
when
we
saw
what
was
happening
when
we
read
the
bills
that
were
being
passed
daily
and
the
others
that
were
under
consideration
we
became
very
much
concerned
it
seemed
clear
to
us
that
even
if
business
continued
good
and
remember
this
was
ten
months
before
the
panic
of
november
that
our
earnings
would
probably
be
considerably
reduced
by
the
reduction
of
freight
and
passenger
rates
in
various
states
and
our
expenses
were
certain
to
be
much
increased
by
some
of
the
legislation
and
also
by
the
advance
in
wages
and
it
was
necessary
to
consider
where
the
money
was
coming
from
to
pay
the
large
bills
that
would
come
due
in
connection
with
the
budget
program
after
considering
the
matter
very
carefully
early
in
january
we
decided
first
not
to
authorize
anything
further
in
the
way
of
improvements
unless
actually
necessary
and
second
to
stop
as
many
things
already
authorized
as
it
was
possible
to
get
along
without
among
the
things
so
put
off
or
deferred
were
the
building
of
a
new
engine
house
and
necessary
shop
buildings
at
clyde
the
construction
of
a
new
line
about
miles
in
length
from
herrin
to
the
ohio
river
double
track
between
galesburg
and
bushnell
new
passenger
depots
at
monmouth
and
several
other
places
work
on
new
terminals
at
lincoln
etc
of
course
it
may
not
have
seemed
to
you
at
the
time
that
we
were
stopping
because
we
still
had
so
many
things
under
way
and
you
can
not
prudently
stop
large
undertakings
all
at
once
for
instance
we
could
not
stop
work
on
the
new
yard
at
galesburg
when
it
was
half
done
and
you
will
recall
that
it
required
more
than
two
years
to
complete
the
plan
but
we
did
slow
up
as
much
as
possible
that
is
to
say
we
tried
to
finish
up
such
things
as
were
authorized
before
january
and
which
were
still
considered
necessary
but
we
did
not
start
any
new
things
the
effect
of
this
is
best
shown
by
the
size
of
the
budget
on
january
it
was
then
a
little
over
or
about
what
is
was
twelve
months
before
in
the
meantime
the
november
panic
of
had
come
upon
us
and
it
seemed
not
only
best
but
necessary
to
continue
the
policy
decided
upon
in
january
of
that
year
and
on
the
of
january
the
budget
as
it
then
stood
and
as
it
now
stands
amounts
to
a
little
less
than
and
this
brings
us
up
to
the
present
time
in
february
i
had
the
honor
to
be
invited
to
the
annual
banquet
of
the
commercial
club
at
clarinda
iowa
and
i
was
asked
to
speak
about
the
railroad
situation
after
referring
to
some
of
the
proposed
laws
that
were
then
under
consideration
in
the
various
states
i
continued
as
follows
i
will
not
speak
of
the
probable
effect
of
such
a
public
policy
as
i
have
referred
to
on
the
general
railroad
situation
as
others
are
much
better
qualified
to
do
that
but
speaking
for
the
company
which
i
represent
we
view
the
situation
with
much
concern
and
we
have
done
i
think
what
any
prudent
manager
would
do
if
he
saw
confronting
him
conditions
which
he
was
certain
would
increase
his
cost
of
operation
a
large
but
unknown
amount
and
at
the
same
time
reduce
his
revenues
we
have
planned
to
curtail
our
expenditures
wherever
possible
i
do
not
mean
that
we
shall
let
the
property
suffer
or
lower
the
character
of
the
service
but
we
will
not
undertake
extensions
or
large
improvements
until
we
can
see
more
clearly
where
the
money
is
coming
from
or
if
it
comes
at
all
how
far
reaching
this
policy
of
retrenchment
or
perhaps
i
should
say
curtailment
will
be
i
at
least
can
not
say
it
will
depend
upon
the
future
certain
it
is
that
our
expenditures
in
that
direction
will
be
much
less
this
year
than
last
which
means
of
course
fewer
men
employed
and
less
material
purchased
it
is
two
years
since
that
was
written
and
i
regret
to
say
that
circumstances
have
not
yet
seemed
to
justify
any
considerable
change
of
policy
the
burlington
company
has
on
its
today
about
men
less
than
in
october
and
less
than
in
february
we
are
doing
all
the
things
that
we
consider
necessary
for
the
safe
operation
of
the
trains
and
for
the
proper
maintenance
of
the
property
but
conditions
so
far
have
not
seemed
to
us
to
justify
a
resumption
of
the
policy
of
betterments
and
extension
followed
during
and
the
preceding
years
i
do
not
know
absolutely
that
it
is
so
but
i
imagine
that
the
other
railroad
companies
have
been
pursuing
much
the
same
course
as
we
have
here
the
latest
reports
indicate
that
the
total
railroad
mileage
of
the
united
states
is
about
so
that
the
burlington
mileage
is
about
of
the
whole
and
if
you
multiply
what
has
happened
on
this
road
by
you
will
get
a
result
for
the
whole
country
which
will
probably
not
be
far
from
the
truth
in
fact
the
eastern
roads
suffered
much
more
from
the
actual
business
depression
than
we
did
in
the
west
it
has
been
stated
by
men
who
should
be
competent
judges
that
from
to
of
all
manufactured
steel
and
iron
is
used
either
directly
or
indirectly
by
the
railroads
and
that
fully
of
all
the
lumber
manufactured
is
so
used
when
it
became
necessary
for
the
railroads
to
stop
buying
new
cars
and
engines
and
also
to
stop
all
new
construction
and
improvements
when
possible
to
do
so
you
can
well
understand
the
effect
that
that
course
must
have
had
upon
the
two
particular
lines
of
business
just
mentioned
of
course
many
other
lines
were
similarly
affected
and
it
would
seem
logical
that
no
full
and
real
resumption
of
business
can
be
expected
until
the
railroads
are
again
able
to
resume
the
policy
which
they
were
forced
to
abandon
early
in
when
will
that
time
come
i
do
not
know
what
will
bring
it
about
i
do
not
know
that
either
but
i
do
know
what
will
help
matters
greatly
at
least
so
far
as
the
burlington
company
is
concerned
but
before
saying
what
i
have
in
mind
in
that
connection
i
will
digress
a
little
and
briefly
explain
something
of
the
financial
responsibilities
of
a
large
railroad
company
because
in
spite
of
all
we
hear
about
corrupt
management
stock
watering
it
is
still
a
fact
that
the
railroads
did
cost
something
and
the
money
that
was
used
for
that
purpose
was
all
or
very
nearly
all
furnished
by
private
persons
like
yourselves
and
it
was
furnished
by
them
for
investment
because
they
thought
or
hoped
such
an
investment
would
be
profitable
to
them
for
there
is
there
can
be
no
other
reason
for
investing
money
in
anything
unless
it
be
invested
for
charitable
purposes
the
burlington
system
today
as
i
have
said
is
over
miles
in
length
it
has
large
terminals
in
chicago
louis
kansas
city
and
the
other
great
cities
it
reaches
it
owns
locomotives
passenger
cars
and
freight
cars
the
last
annual
report
shows
that
its
bonded
debt
or
the
size
of
its
mortgage
amounts
in
round
numbers
to
equal
to
about
a
mile
this
mortgage
is
legally
entitled
to
interest
at
the
average
rate
of
per
cent
per
annum
because
it
is
so
specified
in
the
bond
and
that
interest
must
be
paid
or
the
mortgage
would
be
foreclosed
just
as
would
happen
if
you
failed
to
pay
the
interest
on
a
mortgage
in
case
you
happened
to
have
one
on
your
home
in
addition
to
the
bonded
debt
above
referred
to
there
is
outstanding
of
stock
in
round
figures
or
about
a
mile
making
a
total
capitalization
of
per
mile
we
are
constantly
told
that
the
american
railroads
are
overcapitalized
and
yet
the
burlington
road
could
not
be
replaced
today
for
twice
its
capitalization
i
doubt
if
it
could
be
duplicated
for
three
times
its
outstanding
capital
the
stock
as
you
know
receives
as
interest
or
dividends
whatever
sum
the
directors
may
decide
to
pay
out
of
what
is
left
after
paying
the
operating
expenses
taxes
and
interest
on
the
mortgage
if
there
is
nothing
left
after
paying
the
other
items
mentioned
above
the
stockholders
receive
nothing
so
that
there
is
a
certain
risk
connected
with
an
investment
in
railroad
stock
that
does
not
apply
to
railway
or
government
bonds
for
a
number
of
years
the
burlington
company
has
paid
per
cent
dividends
to
its
stockholders
it
has
earned
more
than
that
as
the
annual
reports
show
and
the
directors
might
legally
and
properly
have
paid
larger
dividends
but
they
did
not
and
all
the
money
earned
in
excess
of
per
cent
on
the
stock
has
been
spent
for
betterments
new
equipment
etc
this
policy
pursued
through
a
long
period
of
years
as
it
has
been
explains
how
it
is
that
the
burlington
is
in
such
good
physical
condition
as
it
is
today
and
with
such
a
low
capitalization
with
this
explanation
you
will
understand
i
am
sure
that
with
an
increase
per
year
in
wages
alone
of
together
with
other
increases
due
to
legislation
such
as
per
year
because
of
the
law
for
operators
and
a
smaller
income
because
of
rates
reduced
freight
and
passenger
in
many
states
the
surplus
if
any
after
paying
dividends
would
be
much
less
than
formerly
and
if
any
new
work
was
undertaken
it
would
be
necessary
to
keep
its
cost
within
such
surplus
as
might
be
available
or
else
borrow
the
money
with
which
to
pay
for
such
work
i
hope
i
have
now
made
clear
why
it
was
that
we
became
worried
about
the
budget
in
january
and
why
for
the
last
two
years
we
have
been
trying
so
to
speak
to
get
our
house
in
order
it
will
perhaps
be
said
that
we
could
have
borrowed
money
for
new
extensions
betterments
and
that
is
actually
what
we
were
compelled
to
do
in
order
to
complete
the
budget
plans
above
referred
to
but
what
prudent
man
would
want
to
borrow
beyond
his
forced
necessities
at
a
time
when
the
future
seemed
so
uncertain
and
when
the
interest
on
the
money
so
borrowed
would
add
that
much
more
to
his
existing
burdens
the
same
sound
principles
should
and
do
underlie
railroad
operations
that
you
should
and
do
apply
to
your
own
personal
affairs
the
items
are
larger
in
the
case
of
the
railroad
that
is
all
i
will
now
repeat
the
question
what
will
bring
about
a
resumption
of
business
on
railroads
and
if
i
have
succeeded
in
making
clear
what
i
sought
to
explain
i
think
you
can
answer
the
question
just
as
well
as
can
but
i
will
give
you
my
views
and
you
will
now
be
in
position
to
judge
whether
they
seem
sound
or
otherwise
in
my
opinion
railroad
business
which
really
means
all
business
will
recover
its
former
proportions
when
the
influences
and
forces
at
work
during
the
last
two
or
three
years
shall
have
ceased
doing
the
things
that
have
contributed
so
largely
towards
bringing
about
the
depression
which
we
all
deplore
perhaps
that
is
not
quite
clear
i
do
not
mean
that
laws
already
made
must
necessarily
be
unmade
that
wages
raised
must
be
reduced
but
we
must
have
a
rest
we
must
be
given
time
and
opportunity
to
work
out
the
new
problems
that
have
been
forced
upon
us
during
the
last
two
years
we
must
be
given
a
chance
to
find
out
what
it
is
going
to
cost
to
meet
the
new
requirements
and
also
how
much
our
revenues
are
going
to
be
reduced
by
reduction
of
rates
perhaps
it
will
be
found
that
by
new
methods
growing
out
of
the
exigencies
of
the
case
we
will
still
be
able
to
earn
a
surplus
sufficient
to
justify
the
resumption
of
extraordinary
expenditures
as
formerly
if
not
then
either
rates
must
be
advanced
or
wages
be
reduced
or
improvements
must
wait
or
be
carried
on
with
borrowed
money
and
railroads
will
be
slow
to
increase
their
debt
under
such
circumstances
as
i
have
said
two
years
ago
during
the
legislative
period
bills
affecting
railroads
were
introduced
in
states
reached
by
the
burlington
system
including
those
proposed
at
washington
so
far
this
season
such
bills
have
been
presented
it
is
too
early
now
to
venture
even
a
guess
as
to
how
many
of
them
will
become
laws
but
until
we
know
just
what
to
expect
you
can
clearly
see
i
am
sure
that
we
will
not
feel
like
incurring
any
new
or
unnecessary
obligations
among
the
bills
so
far
introduced
are
two
in
illinois
called
the
bills
these
two
bills
if
passed
will
increase
the
cost
of
operation
on
the
burlington
road
alone
a
year
on
basis
of
present
business
in
nebraska
a
similar
bill
is
under
consideration
it
is
true
that
the
two
illinois
bills
if
they
become
laws
will
not
necessarily
make
our
operations
in
illinois
unprofitable
but
that
class
of
legislation
will
do
much
to
discourage
new
developments
by
making
such
developments
more
difficult
or
rather
less
profitable
and
besides
in
my
opinion
such
laws
are
not
necessary
as
burlington
employes
you
may
be
interested
in
what
i
am
now
going
to
tell
you
about
the
development
of
the
coal
business
north
through
galesburg
i
need
not
tell
you
how
much
it
has
increased
during
the
last
four
years
for
you
have
seen
it
grow
from
practically
nothing
up
to
its
present
proportions
some
six
or
seven
years
ago
the
burlington
officers
gave
careful
consideration
to
the
problem
of
increasing
the
company
business
and
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
freight
shipments
do
not
just
to
go
this
way
or
that
well
they
finally
decided
that
the
most
promising
opening
was
to
try
and
develop
a
coal
movement
from
southern
illinois
to
the
cities
of
paul
and
minneapolis
and
the
northwest
generally
where
the
winters
are
severe
and
fuel
supply
limited
it
was
found
that
if
coal
from
illinois
was
taken
to
the
twin
cities
it
would
have
to
be
sold
in
competition
with
coal
from
pennsylvania
and
other
eastern
states
shipped
by
water
to
duluth
it
was
also
found
that
the
coal
from
franklin
and
williamson
counties
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
while
of
very
good
quality
would
not
bring
the
same
price
on
the
market
in
paul
as
the
eastern
coal
it
was
also
found
that
in
order
to
be
sold
at
a
sufficient
profit
to
the
dealer
in
competition
with
the
eastern
coal
the
railroad
would
have
to
carry
it
from
herrin
to
paul
miles
for
not
more
than
per
ton
or
mills
per
ton
mile
it
was
also
found
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
this
at
a
profit
to
the
railroad
as
conditions
then
were
that
is
to
say
we
could
not
haul
coal
at
that
rate
and
make
money
on
a
road
full
of
one
per
cent
grades
the
engineers
were
put
to
work
however
and
an
estimate
was
prepared
showing
what
it
would
cost
to
put
the
line
from
savanna
to
herrin
all
to
a
standard
grade
not
exceeding
sixteen
feet
per
mile
the
line
above
savanna
being
all
right
it
was
believed
that
it
would
pay
to
make
the
improvement
and
you
know
the
rest
the
line
was
built
from
centralia
to
herrin
the
was
built
grades
were
cut
and
altogether
more
than
were
spent
to
put
the
road
in
shape
to
haul
coal
to
paul
in
trains
of
course
many
new
engines
were
bought
as
well
as
new
and
high
capacity
cars
suitable
for
the
coal
trade
it
is
a
low
rate
business
and
as
you
know
the
cars
as
a
rule
return
empty
but
handled
over
low
grades
and
in
full
trains
it
pays
a
fair
profit
but
every
additional
item
of
cost
of
course
reduces
the
profit
now
to
show
the
effect
of
proposed
legislation
in
nebraska
a
bill
has
been
introduced
placing
the
limit
of
cars
that
can
be
legally
handled
in
one
train
at
fifty
if
this
bill
becomes
a
law
how
long
will
it
be
before
somebody
will
want
a
similar
one
in
illinois
and
if
you
are
going
to
fix
a
limit
so
as
to
make
it
necessary
to
run
more
trains
and
consequently
employ
more
men
and
that
is
the
undoubted
purpose
of
the
bill
how
long
will
it
be
before
the
limit
will
be
reduced
to
forty
or
even
where
will
the
thing
end
and
when
with
the
mere
possibility
of
such
legislation
looming
up
in
the
future
can
you
expect
improvements
such
as
i
have
just
described
to
continue
would
you
recommend
them
if
in
my
place
how
long
will
such
legislation
find
favor
in
our
halls
of
congress
just
as
long
as
your
representatives
think
you
want
it
by
you
i
mean
the
majority
of
their
constituents
and
no
longer
your
representatives
and
senators
are
human
they
seek
to
obtain
political
preferment
at
the
polls
and
desire
to
remain
in
office
they
must
have
a
majority
of
the
votes
to
be
elected
and
naturally
they
will
shape
their
course
so
as
to
meet
your
wishes
as
they
understand
them
because
by
so
doing
they
hope
to
retain
your
support
no
one
today
questions
the
right
of
the
properly
constituted
authorities
to
supervise
the
railroads
no
one
defends
the
rebate
or
discrimination
of
any
kind
but
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
recently
well
said
must
be
remembered
that
railroads
are
the
private
property
of
their
owners
that
while
from
the
public
character
of
the
work
in
which
they
are
engaged
the
public
has
the
power
to
prescribe
rules
for
securing
faithful
and
efficient
service
and
equality
between
shippers
and
communities
yet
in
no
proper
sense
is
the
public
a
general
no
doubt
there
may
be
much
in
connection
with
railway
management
in
the
past
and
for
that
matter
at
the
present
time
as
well
to
criticise
but
please
tell
me
what
line
of
human
undertaking
since
the
world
began
be
it
industrial
educational
or
religious
has
been
free
from
criticism
and
granting
all
that
is
said
against
the
railroads
then
what
this
is
what
we
find
that
the
railroad
rates
in
this
country
are
the
lowest
in
the
world
with
few
minor
exceptions
not
worth
considering
that
the
wages
paid
railroad
employes
in
the
united
states
are
higher
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
and
that
the
capitalization
of
american
railroads
per
mile
as
reported
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
but
as
much
as
that
of
english
railroads
and
that
of
the
railroads
of
germany
and
france
and
that
of
belgium
and
this
has
all
been
accomplished
in
a
country
where
a
high
protective
tariff
obtains
and
where
everything
the
railroad
uses
costs
more
on
that
account
it
is
claimed
that
our
manufacturers
must
have
the
protection
of
a
high
tariff
in
order
to
enable
them
to
meet
the
prices
of
their
foreign
competitors
and
pay
american
wages
but
the
american
railroad
sells
its
product
that
is
transportation
for
less
than
any
other
nation
and
still
pays
higher
wages
a
locomotive
engineer
for
instance
receives
per
day
here
as
against
per
day
in
england
and
per
day
in
belgium
it
is
sometimes
said
that
railroads
have
received
great
help
from
the
people
in
the
shape
of
land
grants
and
on
that
account
should
give
much
in
return
let
me
give
one
instance
of
how
this
has
worked
with
the
burlington
company
in
order
to
induce
the
original
projectors
of
this
line
to
extend
the
road
through
iowa
this
company
was
given
acres
of
government
land
in
that
state
selling
at
that
time
at
per
acre
amounting
to
less
than
cash
value
by
an
act
of
congress
passed
over
years
ago
a
reduction
is
made
of
per
cent
from
the
mail
pay
on
all
land
grant
roads
at
the
present
time
the
amount
so
deducted
from
the
burlington
because
of
the
iowa
grant
amounts
to
over
a
year
and
since
the
law
was
passed
has
amounted
in
the
aggregate
to
over
or
more
than
three
times
the
original
value
of
the
entire
grant
not
only
that
but
it
goes
on
without
end
do
you
think
that
is
fair
we
do
not
ask
for
favors
we
wish
to
be
treated
fairly
that
is
all
no
one
can
possibly
be
more
interested
in
the
prosperity
of
the
railroads
than
the
railroad
employes
from
every
dollar
earned
by
the
railroad
cents
go
directly
to
pay
wages
of
railway
employes
while
only
cents
or
that
amount
go
to
pay
interest
and
dividends
in
no
other
country
in
the
world
does
the
railroad
employe
get
so
large
a
share
and
the
security
holder
so
little
why
should
not
the
man
who
invests
his
money
in
railroad
stock
receive
as
much
return
in
shape
of
dividends
as
the
man
who
invests
his
in
a
farm
or
factory
the
last
census
report
of
the
government
that
for
showed
that
money
invested
in
farm
lands
in
the
united
states
earned
an
average
return
of
over
per
cent
and
money
invested
in
manufactures
earned
over
per
cent
the
governor
of
iowa
in
a
printed
article
over
his
own
signature
appearing
in
the
february
number
of
farming
gave
a
number
of
specific
instances
where
money
invested
in
farm
lands
in
iowa
earned
from
to
per
cent
and
he
referred
to
such
cases
as
typical
the
last
report
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
shows
total
earnings
of
all
railroads
in
the
united
states
for
year
ending
june
to
have
been
it
also
shows
total
capitalization
as
and
money
paid
as
interest
and
dividends
equal
to
per
cent
on
capitalization
certainly
this
does
not
seem
excessive
when
compared
with
profits
in
farming
and
manufacturing
as
given
above
we
are
glad
to
know
that
our
farmers
and
manufacturers
are
prosperous
because
we
have
long
since
learned
that
when
they
are
not
prosperous
the
railroads
can
not
prosper
i
fear
they
have
not
yet
fully
realized
that
it
is
better
for
them
also
that
the
railroads
should
prosper
we
hear
no
complaints
in
congress
or
elsewhere
because
our
farmers
and
manufacturers
are
prosperous
in
fact
we
are
all
inclined
to
boast
about
it
the
last
annual
report
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
gives
the
aggregate
capitalization
of
the
railroads
in
the
united
states
as
over
showing
that
the
railroad
investment
in
our
country
is
second
in
amount
only
to
that
in
agriculture
it
is
estimated
that
the
number
of
railroad
stockholders
today
is
over
we
know
that
in
over
men
were
employed
on
american
railroads
do
you
know
of
any
good
reason
why
this
army
of
railroad
men
together
with
the
stockholders
should
not
receive
as
fair
consideration
from
government
and
people
at
large
as
the
farmer
and
manufacturer
receive
and
yet
the
government
in
effect
lets
the
one
have
money
without
interest
to
buy
his
land
and
by
means
of
a
tariff
makes
you
pay
more
for
much
that
you
buy
so
that
the
other
can
pay
his
employes
good
wages
personally
i
make
no
complaint
because
of
either
of
these
things
but
so
far
as
i
can
learn
no
one
in
congress
has
suggested
that
railroads
should
raise
their
rates
so
that
you
might
receive
higher
wages
and
yet
the
two
things
rates
and
wages
are
very
closely
related
if
anything
i
have
said
has
helped
you
to
a
better
understanding
of
the
railroad
problem
i
am
glad
if
it
has
caused
you
to
take
a
renewed
or
deeper
interest
in
the
subject
i
am
glad
i
could
go
on
and
multiply
cases
in
confirmation
of
what
i
have
said
had
i
the
time
but
what
i
have
said
already
is
perhaps
sufficient
do
you
intend
to
make
railroading
your
life
business
are
you
interested
in
the
prosperity
of
railroads
and
particularly
of
the
burlington
do
you
clearly
see
the
relation
between
rates
and
wages
do
you
think
wages
are
too
high
if
not
perhaps
you
do
not
agree
with
one
of
your
congressmen
in
washington
who
has
just
recently
on
the
floor
of
the
house
urged
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
be
given
more
power
over
rates
which
means
power
to
reduce
them
still
more
because
they
have
never
so
far
as
i
have
heard
exercised
their
power
over
rates
in
any
other
way
personally
i
am
glad
i
can
claim
to
be
a
railroad
man
and
not
only
glad
but
proud
of
it
as
well
i
think
the
american
railway
is
the
one
great
institution
above
all
others
that
americans
should
be
proud
of
lawson

englishman
who
investigated
our
railroads
in

upon
his
return
in
his
book
on
american
industrial
problems
the
science
of
transportation
is
going
to
be

special
contribution
of
the
american
people
to
political
economy
neville
priestley
an
english
gentleman
and
under
secretary
to
the
government
of
india
railway
department
came
to
this
country
in
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
our
american
railroads
his
report
was
submitted
to
the
english
government
and
printed
c
among
other
things
he
said
american
railway
men
are
quick
to
see
a
new
idea
they
are
quicker
still
to
try
it
they
take
a
great
pride
in
their
profession
and
are
striving
to
get
at
the
science
of
it
that
their
methods
are
not
always
perfect
is
what
might
have
been
expected
but
they
have
managed
to
do
what
no
other
country
in
the
world
has
done
and
that
is
carry
their
goods
traffic
profitably
at
extraordinarily
low
rates
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
they
pay
more
for
their
labor
than
any
other
country
it
is
in
the
study
of
how
they
do
this
that
much
benefit
can
be
derived
by
other
countries
leroy
beaulieu

distinguished
french
economist
who
visited
this
country
in

american

all
in

the

as
the
excellence

service
it
renders

undeniable
if
therefore
one
were
in
search
of
model
railway
methods
it
would
be
wise
to
turn
to
those
practiced
under

not
to
those
illustrated

operated

c
a
condensation
of
priestley
able
report
was
made
for
the
bureau
of
railway
news
and
can
be
had
on

the
railroad
situation
of
today
by
frank
trumbull
president
of
the
colorado
southern
railway
company
an
address
to
the
western

their
annual
dinner
chicago
president
and
gentlemen
of
the
i
shall
not
attempt
to
deal
with
any
technical
phase
of
the
railroad
industry
and
in
saying
this
i
am
emboldened
by
a
declaration
which
i
find
in
the
constitution
of
your
society
this
society
shall
neither
endorse
nor
recommend
any
individual
or
any
specific
or
engineering
production
but
the
opinion
of
the
society
may
be
expressed
on
such
subjects
as
affect
public
welfare
the
american
railroad
administration
of
today
has
abundantly
demonstrated
its
ability
to
solve
all
engineering
and
mechanical
problems
and
we
may
rely
upon
it
that
the
same
american
enterprise
and
valor
which
have
gridironed
the
continent
with
shining
bands
of
steel
will
solve
any
technical
problem
that
may
be
ahead
of
us
for
which
money
may
be
had
i
therefore
proceed
at
once
to
engage
your
thought
for
a
few
minutes
if
i
may
upon
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
great
problem
of
the
american
railroad
situation
of
today
that
is
how
to
satisfactorily
settle
the
relations
between
private
capital
and
the
users
of
the
railroads
four
years
retrospect
during
the
last
four
years
the
american
railroad
has
been
in
a
seething
cauldron
of
publicity
a
good
deal
of
refuse
has
risen
to
the
surface
and
has
needed
to
be
skimmed
off
but
i
think
i
do
not
violate
any
confidence
in
saying
that
not
all
of
it
has
come
from
the
body
of
the
railroad
part
of
it
seems
to
consist
of
political
bacteria
and
defunct
statutes
which
attempted
to
violate
the
voice
of
the
people
the
constitution
which
legislators
had
sworn
to
support
and
in
this
connection
perhaps
i
ought
in
passing
to
say
a
word
which
has
rarely
been
spoken
in
defense
of
the
railroads
by
pointing
out
the
shame
of
putting
them
to
the
great
cost
of
proving
in
the
courts
the
unconstitutionality
of
statutes
which
ought
never
to
have
been
enacted
because
they
were
never
valid
in
the
last
four
years
there
has
been
much
noise
the
air
has
been
filled
with
shouts
and
cries
and
more
or
less
dust
hysteria
and
virtue
although
really
not
at
all
alike
became
confused
and
a
very
large
percentage
of
the
public
absorbed
the
idea
that
the
railroad
highways
are
public
property
forgetting
that
all
of
us
are
absolutely
dependent
upon
private
capital
for
the
american
railroad
of
today
again
we
seem
to
have
been
upon
a
ocean
fortunate
are
we
that
through
it
all
has
run
the
gulf
stream
of
our
wonderful
american
resources
if
it
were
not
for
that
we
should
all
have
been
ruined
we
have
survived
but
the
pity
of
it
is
to
think
how
much
better
off
we
might
be
if
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
would
in
financial
legislation
railroad
regulation
and
other
matters
only
exercise
our
wisdom
as
much
as
we
do
our
power
legislation
has
been
restrictive
not
constructive
there
is
very
little
in
it
thus
far
to
help
the
railroad
nearly
everything
seems
to
have
been
thought
of
except
provision
for
money
or
for
improving
credit
so
as
to
command
cheap
money
the
country
has
been
flooded
with
conflicting
laws
and
still
the
cry
goes
up
for
more
bureaucratic
power
and
more
statutes
it
reminds
me
of
an
immigration
meeting
in
mississippi
the
was
filled
with
an
assemblage
of
white
people
and
when
the
meeting
adjourned
an
old
darkey
asked
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
came
out
of
the
what
the
meeting
was
for
the
reply
was
that
it
was
an
immigration
meeting
what
is
dat
asked
the
darkey
to
which
the
gentleman
responded
we
want
to
get
more
white
people
from
the
north
and
east
to
settle
here
whereupon
the
darkey
said
foh
de
lawd
sake
majah
dars
moh
white
people
in
dis
county
now
dan
us
niggahs
can
support
i
admit
there
have
been
many
evils
in
railroad
administration
but
i
modestly
affirm
that
there
have
been
no
more
than
in
other
lines
of
business
the
railroad
industry
of
this
country
is
young
and
it
acquired
some
children
diseases
many
people
think
the
railroads
would
have
recovered
from
measles
mumps
and
whooping
cough
without
prescriptions
from
varieties
of
doctors
states
plus
the
federal
government
it
has
seemed
many
times
that
the
railroad
patient
has
been
like
the
man
who
fell
ill
in
some
mysterious
way
the
consulting
surgeons
determined
that
an
operation
was
necessary
they
could
not
locate
any
definite
malady
but
they
found
five
hundred
dollars
on
him
so
they
operated
on
him
for
that
of
one
thing
however
we
may
be
absolutely
sure
that
is
that
the
law
of
compensation
is
always
at
work
if
we
have
an
excess
of
regulation
there
is
less
of
something
else
it
is
entirely
probable
that
if
there
had
been
no
political
regulation
of
railroads
the
people
of
this
country
would
have
more
roads
far
better
and
safer
roads
and
a
greater
distribution
of
wealth
than
they
have
today
but
i
must
not
forget
that
according
to
the
subject
assigned
me
we
are
here
not
to
look
backward
but
to
look
at
the
present
and
then
perhaps
take
a
little
look
forward
some
contradictions
from
a
mechanical
and
traffic
standpoint
the
american
railroad
of
today
is
one
of
the
wonders
of
the
age
i
give
one
illustration
only
compare
its
splendid
performance
with
a
report
i
have
here
of
the
northeastern
railway
of
england
which
has
a
large
mineral
traffic
this
report
shows
average
contents
of
loaded
freight
cars
to
be
tons
and
average
contents
of
freight
trains
to
be
tons
d
on
the
other
hand
the
american
railroad
situation
in
its
political
and
governmental
relations
is
a
bundle
of
contradictions
if
you
were
to
engage
your
money
in
merchandising
or
manufacturing
you
would
no
doubt
be
appalled
if
you
should
discover
that
some
one
entirely
outside
of
your
line
of
business
could
fix
the
prices
at
which
you
must
sell
your
product
and
that
the
burden
of
proof
that
the
prices
so
fixed
are
confiscatory
is
upon
you
and
that
you
could
not
abandon
your
operations
yet
this
is
precisely
what
may
happen
if
you
invest
your
money
in
a
railroad
the
contradiction
is
that
there
are
no
reciprocal
assurances
in
your
behalf
neither
the
state
nor
the
federal
government
will
give
you
any
financial
aid
nor
will
they
guarantee
you
anything
nor
will
they
even
protect
you
against
competition
as
france
has
long
since
been
wise
enough
to
do
a
second
contradiction
is
that
although
there
was
a
four
war
to
prevent
a
division
of
this
country
and
although
thereafter
our
american
genius
connected
up
remote
sections
of
our
common
country
and
although
the
work
of
the
railroads
has
been
splendidly
national
the
attempt
to
regulate
them
has
been
lamentably
local
and
lilliputian
i
need
only
cite
the
conflicts
between
the
enactments
and
of
different
states
and
those
of
the
federal
government
we
hear
more
or
less
these
days
about
the
twilight
zone
between
the
states
on
the
one
hand
and
the
federal
government
on
the
other
but
for
those
who
administer
the
affairs
of
a
great
railroad
system
the
phrase
twilight
zone
is
too
polite
a
term
it
is
instead
a
jungle
in
which
the
wayfaring
railroad
man
may
easily
lose
his
way
and
possibly
be
actually
devoured
by
laws
with
teeth
in
them
we
hear
a
great
deal
about
the
simple
desire
that
the
railroads
shall
obey
the
law
but
who
is
wise
enough
to
say
what
the
law
is
when
only
yesterday
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
left
an
important
case
unsettled
so
far
as
it
was
concerned
because
it
was
divided
four
to
four
these
uncertain
and
conflicting
laws
and
changes
in
rates
confuse
the
railroad
manager
more
than
the
public
has
ever
realized
a
third
contradiction
is
the
attempt
by
laws
to
maintain
the
competitive
idea
alongside
regulation
as
if
unrestricted
competition
were
compatible
with
compulsory
uniformity
in
rates
and
service
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
other
high
officials
have
spoken
in
no
uncertain
terms
concerning
the
absurdity
of
a
situation
like
this
and
yet
thus
far
there
is
no
relief
a
fourth
contradiction
is
found
in
the
great
increase
in
cost
of
producing
transportation
without
the
corresponding
increases
in
selling
prices
which
have
taken
place
in
other
kinds
of
business
in
which
private
capital
is
engaged
the
erroneous
impression
seems
to
prevail
that
the
supply
of
capital
for
the
railroad
industry
is
an
inexhaustible
reservoir
regardless
of
the
compensation
which
it
shall
receive
and
the
conditions
under
which
it
shall
perform
its
work
a
fifth
contradiction
is
the
effort
to
connect
up
with
physical
valuations
if
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
the
politicians
to
have
a
physical
valuation
of
all
the
railroads
in
the
united
states
and
the
people
are
willing
to
be
taxed
to
pay
the
great
expense
of
obtaining
it
perhaps
no
great
harm
will
be
done
but
i
believe
all
of
us
here
would
concede
that
valuations
by
the
ablest
engineers
if
separately
made
would
not
agree
and
that
before
such
valuations
could
be
finished
they
would
be
out
of
date
some
of
us
probably
think
that
for
purposes
the
government
may
as
well
be
employed
in
making
a
physical
valuation
of
farms
and
farm
improvements
in
order
to
ascertain
what
is
a
fair
price
for
wheat
or
for
that
matter
perhaps
be
as
well
employed
in
adding
up
car
numbers
i
know
something
of
a
piece
of
railroad
out
west
which
in
a
great
mining
excitement
was
built
through
rocky
and
tortuous
gorges
and
with
four
per
cent
grade
hung
upon
the
precipitous
sides
of
awful
mountains
in
a
climate
described
by
one
of
the
inhabitants
as
consisting
of
three
seasons
july
august
and
winter
later
the
boom
evaporated
and
the
business
of
the
road
got
down
to
one
train
a
day
in
the
low
ebb
of
traffic
a
brakeman
one
day
sifted
into
the
trainmaster
office
and
asked
for
a
job
the
trainmaster
put
him
through
the
catechism
and
among
other
things
inquired
what
would
you
think
if
you
saw
a
train
carrying
green
signals
to
which
the
applicant
promptly
responded
i
think
business
was
picking
up
now
can
any
of
us
tell
what
they
would
do
in
washington
with
a
physical
valuation
of
a
road
like
that
its
rates
today
are
only
about
what
they
were
at
first
a
sixth
contradiction
is
the
desire
to
regulate
capitalization
now
it
may
be
that
there
have
been
abuses
but
if
one
asks
any
of
these
critics
what
is
the
grievance
to
be
remedied
great
silence
usually
falls
upon
them
for
they
are
unable
to
show
any
more
relation
between
and
either
physical
valuation
or
capitalization
than
there
is
between
the
price
of
a
pair
of
suspenders
and
the
physical
valuation
or
capitalization
of
a
department
store
railroads
are
continually
importuned
to
make
rates
that
will
move
the
business
as
in
the
case
of
the
western
road
just
cited
and
those
parts
of
the
united
states
which
have
the
highest
railroad
capitalization
have
the
lowest
average
freight
rate
if
you
will
look
at
the
review
of
for
the
month
of
june
you
will
find
a
very
interesting
article
by
interstate
commerce
commissioner
lane
on
railroad
capitalization
and
federal
regulation
his
program
is
a
very
simple
one
and
while
pointing
out
that
there
should
be
some
way
of
insuring
that
the
proceeds
of
all
railroad
securities
shall
be
actually
invested
in
acquisition
of
property
construction
completion
extension
or
improvement
of
facilities
the
improvement
or
maintenance
of
service
and
the
discharge
or
lawful
refunding
of
obligations
he
says
fundamentally
there
is
at
present
no
of
capitalization
and
rate
the
latter
is
not
in
law
nor
in
railroad
policy
the
child
of
the
former
though
railroad
men
have
sometimes
expediently
urged
the
claim
and
courts
have
sometimes
too
kindly
given
it
their
nod
of
sanction
also
the
most
potent
kind
of
regulation
is
that
which
casts
the
burden
upon
the
individual
to
do
the
regulating
himself
and
makes
him
responsible
to
the
law
for
dereliction
and
the
plan
for
the
regulation
of
capitalization
here
presented
is
founded
upon
that
theory
to
require
the
directors
of
the
railroad
companies
to
make
public
announcement
of
their
security
issues
to
publish
the
objects
for
which
such
issues
are
made
and
be
responsible
for
the
use
of
the
proceeds
in
the
precise
and
limited
manner
announced
this
is
far
too
modest
a
program
to
please
those
who
delight
in
elaborate
methods
of
procedure
involving
much
filing
of
forms
and
petitions
and
many
hearings
appraisements
viseings
and
solemn
givings
of
consent
and
without
question
it
is
not
nearly
as
thoroughgoing
a
plan
as
others
which
have
been
devised
but
the
simpler
the
plan
is
the
better
if
it
may
effect
its
purpose
he
further
says
that
his
program
does
not
guarantee
the
prospective
purchaser
of
the
stock
that
the
stock
certificate
which
bears
a
printed
par
value
upon
its
face
does
in
fact
represent
property
of
the
full
value
so
designated
this
is
not
a
duty
which
the
government
for
any
reason
is
bound
to
and
i
know
of
no
motive
arising
out
of
national
policy
which
compels
the
assumption
of
such
responsibility
certainly
not
at
present
if
our
complex
government
shall
control
all
future
issues
of
railroad
capitalization
we
may
rely
upon
it
that
most
of
the
new
railroad
construction
in
this
country
instead
of
being
independent
will
be
fathered
by
existing
railroad
systems
because
their
established
credit
whatever
it
may
be
will
be
required
reconciliation
is
it
not
evident
that
these
contradictions
never
can
be
reconciled
by
untrained
men
i
believe
that
for
the
american
railroad
the
time
has
gone
by
when
illiterate
men
will
be
put
in
charge
of
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
machinery
and
other
property
we
are
in
a
new
era
railroading
is
rapidly
coming
to
be
a
profession
we
are
necessarily
in
all
things
doing
more
and
more
specializing
why
not
insist
that
the
regulation
also
shall
be
in
accordance
with
ethical
principles
and
not
determined
by
political
expediency
the
great
problem
of
reconciling
private
capital
and
the
users
of
railroads
and
the
contradictions
which
i
have
mentioned
are
the
inheritance
of
this
generation
of
railroad
men
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
this
generation
like
all
previous
ones
will
be
equal
to
the
task
put
upon
it
out
of
the
painful
processes
of
the
last
four
years
we
have
emerged
with
some
gains
in
the
first
place
the
country
now
realizes
that
the
one
million
five
hundred
thousand
employes
and
officers
of
american
railroads
are
not
surpassed
in
integrity
by
any
other
similar
number
of
business
men
during
the
four
years
hardly
a
voice
has
been
lifted
to
say
this
and
so
i
am
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
to
raise
my
own
in
their
commendation
in
the
second
place
it
is
easier
for
shippers
and
railroad
traffic
men
to
be
honest
than
it
ever
was
before
the
stoppage
of
rebates
is
a
distinct
gain
morally
as
well
as
financially
in
the
third
place
it
has
been
demonstrated
i
think
that
our
government
always
to
be
bigger
than
any
corporation
or
any
man
or
any
set
of
men
and
this
is
a
good
thing
for
us
never
to
forget
already
publicity
has
brought
about
a
friendlier
feeling
between
the
people
and
the
railroads
and
along
certain
paths
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
find
our
way
out
of
our
difficulties
for
the
american
people
are
unfair
when
they
understand
a
situation
upon
one
occasion
i
was
making
a
trip
over
a
division
of
road
where
there
was
no
competition
and
where
we
therefore
enjoyed
one
hundred
per
cent
of
the
business
there
was
an
unexpected
stop
for
something
and
a
brakeman
went
to
the
rear
to
protect
the
train
presently
a
of
girls
came
in
sight
the
brakeman
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
initiated
a
flirtation
then
discovering
that
i
had
seen
the
performance
and
evidently
desiring
to
square
himself
he
said
without
hesitation
if
we
make
friends
of
these
people
they
ride
on
our
road
one
could
hardly
convey
better
than
that
brakeman
did
to
me
an
idea
which
we
should
never
abandon
namely
that
one
of
the
best
assets
a
road
can
have
is
friends
and
i
suggest
that
probably
our
first
duty
is
to
keep
in
good
humor
and
be
considerate
one
for
another
that
involves
and
includes
good
service
to
the
public
and
nothing
will
help
more
to
keep
the
public
in
good
humor
the
people
of
this
country
already
have
the
lowest
rates
and
the
highest
wages
in
the
world
they
are
the
best
people
in
the
world
and
are
entitled
to
the
best
service
in
everything
i
believe
they
should
insist
upon
having
the
best
railroads
and
when
they
so
insist
and
realize
that
our
population
has
thus
far
doubled
every
thirty
years
and
will
soon
be
one
hundred
million
and
not
very
long
after
that
one
hundred
and
million
and
that
our
transportation
necessities
double
faster
than
our
population
does
they
will
set
about
finding
out
what
is
necessary
to
obtain
adequate
railroads
and
then
we
shall
probably
hear
less
about
rates
and
more
about
efficiency
and
safety
when
the
people
do
this
they
will
soon
discover
that
it
is
no
more
disgraceful
to
make
money
in
building
railroads
than
in
selling
land
or
in
merchandising
or
in
manufacturing
or
in
mining
they
will
also
discover
that
although
the
courts
have
said
railroad
investors
are
entitled
to
a
reasonable
return
upon
a
fair
value
no
court
not
even
that
great
tribunal
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
can
finally
say
what
is
a
reasonable
return
this
question
would
still
be
unsettled
because
we
have
not
yet
gotten
away
from
our
dependence
upon
private
capital
what
is
a
reasonable
return
must
be
answered
by
the
investor
as
well
as
by
the
commissions
or
the
courts
because
it
always
takes
two
to
make
a
bargain
and
money
like
its
human
owners
will
go
where
it
has
the
best
prospective
reward
and
the
greatest
liberty
the
people
will
find
that
what
we
need
in
this
country
is
not
more
bureaucratic
government
by
untrained
officials
with
brief
tenures
of
political
office
or
more
power
to
commissions
but
more
responsibility
upon
boards
of
directors
if
statutes
are
necessary
to
insure
this
well
and
good
but
if
regulation
is
general
in
character
and
national
in
scope
is
directed
against
oppression
and
discrimination
and
designed
to
promote
safety
and
efficiency
and
faithful
accounting
the
people
will
get
better
results
from
intelligent
and
honest
directors
than
they
will
from
the
best
governmental
management
which
can
be
devised
and
so
long
as
the
railroads
are
owned
by
private
investors
those
investors
will
doubtless
insist
upon
their
directors
having
more
and
more
to
do
i
am
aware
that
there
is
a
socialistic
trend
all
over
the
world
there
is
more
and
more
disposition
to
prescribe
medicine
for
other
people
to
take
but
no
amount
of
legislation
will
change
the
fundamental
laws
of
the
universe
the
fact
is
notwithstanding
our
declaration
of
independence
men
are
not
created
equal
it
is
a
fine
thing
for
all
of
us
that
they
are
not
there
is
a
diversity
of
gifts
is
one
of
them
but
a
man
may
have
the
talent
for
making
money
and
be
totally
unable
to
build
a
bridge
or
paint
a
portrait
or
lead
an
orchestra
or
an
army
and
if
fortunes
are
acquired
under
the
laws
which
we
ourselves
have
made
why
should
we
be
envious
unless
a
rich
man
hoards
money
like
a
miser
it
is
if
not
alarmed
continuously
at
work
for
all
of
us
through
the
banks
or
otherwise
in
spite
of
anything
he
can
do
and
the
cheaper
it
can
be
had
the
greater
the
economy
to
society
as
a
whole
it
is
impossible
to
reduce
everybody
to
a
dead
level
and
how
monotonous
it
would
be
if
we
could
we
do
satisfy
everybody
even
in
our
form
of
government
which
we
are
prone
to
think
is
the
best
in
the
world
for
example
at
the
last
election
six
and
a
half
million
people
did
not
get
what
they
voted
for
part
of
them
got
what
they
really
wanted
but
on
the
face
of
the
returns
six
and
a
half
million
were
disappointed
and
yet
the
country
goes
happily
on
apparently
to
greater
prosperity
than
ever
but
how
much
happier
and
how
much
more
prosperous
we
might
be
if
there
were
not
so
much
untrained
meddling
if
there
were
not
so
many
brakes
upon
the
wheels
of
our
progress
a
brake
we
all
admit
is
a
good
thing
in
its
place
but
it
has
no
power
and
the
efforts
of
the
time
to
combine
in
one
man
or
in
any
one
body
of
men
the
four
functions
of
prosecuting
attorney
judge
jury
and
executioner
must
sooner
or
later
give
way
first
because
it
is
and
where
such
a
condition
exists
as
alexander
hamilton
pointed
out
to
the
people
of
new
york
there
is
no
liberty
second
because
it
will
not
work
practically
reconciliation
of
private
capital
and
the
users
of
railroads
might
of
course
be
brought
about
by
government
ownership
because
if
there
were
a
deficit
the
people
could
pay
it
in
their
taxes
even
then
railroad
rates
could
not
be
made
mathematically
consistent
for
government
is
never
mathematically
consistent
for
example
if
i
mail
a
letter
to
san
francisco
or
london
i
pay
two
cents
and
if
you
mail
a
letter
to
evanston
you
pay
two
cents
but
nobody
seems
to
want
government
ownership
although
many
people
contend
that
that
would
be
much
fairer
and
more
honest
than
governmental
control
of
railroads
without
financial
responsibility
perhaps
a
middle
ground
may
sometime
be
worked
out
by
a
arrangement
as
in
chicago
between
the
city
and
the
street
railway
companies
that
would
have
its
advantages
among
the
advantages
would
be
cheaper
money
for
railroads
if
the
government
would
guarantee
a
minimum
return
on
agreed
valuations
but
of
course
this
would
be
much
more
complex
than
to
work
out
an
arrangement
with
corporations
like
street
railways
which
do
a
single
kind
of
business
at
one
rate
instead
of
a
business
affecting
every
commodity
of
human
consumption
and
stretching
through
states
and
two
territories
however
i
think
there
is
food
for
thought
for
all
of
us
in
what
has
been
accomplished
here
in
chicago
and
the
professional
intellect
present
tonight
may
well
think
it
over
finally
while
a
man
has
as
good
a
right
to
increase
his
fortune
by
investing
in
railroads
as
in
any
other
manner
no
matter
what
it
may
be
i
believe
we
shall
find
a
solution
for
some
of
the
puzzles
that
beset
us
not
through
the
gospel
of
tyranny
on
the
one
hand
nor
the
gospel
of
equality
on
the
other
hand
but
through
a
gospel
of
stewardship
let
us
all
feel
that
although
the
acquisitive
faculty
is
undoubtedly
planted
in
the
human
breast
for
some
wise
purpose
we
are
not
here
primarily
for
personal
aggrandizement
we
are
here
for
service
and
the
greater
our
talents
or
our
wealth
or
our
opportunities
the
greater
our
responsibility
we
are
trustees
for
the
users
of
our
railroads
for
our
employees
and
for
investors
and
let
us
welcome
all
the
additional
responsibility
which
may
be
put
upon
us
as
directors
or
salaried
officials
i
am
sure
this
sentiment
will
commend
itself
to
all
of
you
because
there
is
no
body
of
men
in
the
world
which
has
a
higher
code
of
ethics
and
which
has
demonstrated
personal
fidelity
in
a
higher
degree
than
the
engineers
of
america

vastly
the
greater
proportion
of
the
commodities
moved
by
the
railroads
are
in
the
processes
of
commerce
that
is
the
conveyance
from
the
place
of
consignment
to
place
of
receipt
in
the
majority
of
cases
is
sequent
to

the
margin
within
which

may

is
therefore
limited
in

direction
by
the
amount
which
the

of

will
accept
and
the
purchaser
will
pay
and

at

approximately
as
great
as
from

in
which
it
might
be
feasible
for
him
to
engage
he
will
other
things
equal
change
his
business
and
the
railroad
will
no
longer
have
the
traffic
that
flowed
from
his
operations
a
railroad
therefore
must
adjust
its
transportation
charges
that
production
may
continue
this
includes
the
adjustment
of
rates
that
products
may
be
sent
to
markets
that
the
products
of
the
region
tributary
to
one
railroad
may
reach
markets
in
competition
with
similar
products
of
other
regions
and
in
competition
with
other
products
that
will
answer
the
same
purpose
the
wider
the
markets
that
the
producers
can
reach
the
greater
is
the
encouragement
to
production
the
more
numerous
and
varied
the
sources
of
supply
of
which
the

has
choice
the
more

will

or
whether
the

by

or
the

it
has
long
been
claimed
by
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
that
their
rates
of
freight
are
lower
than
those
of
any
other
country
and
that
the
nation
progress
in
industry
and
commerce
has
in
large
measure
been
due
to
the
cheapness
and
the
efficiency
of
its
transportation

by
way
of
proof
has
been
instanced
the
proportion
that
the
transportation
charge
bears
to
the
selling
price
of
the
staple
commodities
it
is
said
that
the
rate
charged
for
the
transportation
of
food
products
does
not
affect
their
selling
price
in
any
market
of
the

being
fixed

processes
of
supply
and

which
the
amount
of

it

it
has
not

as
applies
in

to

data
as
to
the
amount
of
transportation
charge
carried
by
the
various
kinds
of
raw
material
entering
into
a
manufactured
product
has
not
in
many
cases
been
so
easy
of
ascertainment
a
principal
reason
has
been
that
the
manufacturers
in
numbers
of
instances
do
not
know
what
it
is
themselves
many
kinds
of
material
are
bought
at
a
price
which
includes
delivery
at
the
factory
the
freight
rate
not
coming
under
the
cognizance
of
the
purchaser
the
different
materials
used
in
a
product
may
have
come
from
such
diverse
sources
and
paid
such
varying
rates
of
freight
that
the
ascertainment
of
the
total
freight
charge
in
any
given
unit
of
manufacture
would
be
too
difficult
to
be
worth
while
in
numerous
other
cases
the
freight
charge
is
confessedly
so
small
an
item
that
no
attempt
is
made
to
apportion
it
as
an
item
of
expenditure
per
unit
of
product
the
total
simply
being
grouped
in
the

of

the

that
the
transportation
charge
borne
by
the
material
entering
into
an
ordinary

of

shoes
averages
one

the
result
of
a
definite
calculation
made
by
one
of
the
largest
shoe
manufacturers
of
the
country
a
leading
woolen

estimates
that
the

will
average
perhaps

far
western
region
have
been
adjusted
under
the
necessity
of
the
transportation
agencies
to
so
serve
the
mines
that
their
products
may
be
marketed
the
rate
upon
the
ore
from
the

to
the
smelter
upon
the

from
the
smelter
to
the
refinery
and
upon
the
refined
lead
or
refined
copper
from
chicago
to
the
seaboard
market
are
all
determined
by
this
prime
factor
the
freight
charges
for
example
from
the
coeur
district
in
northern
idaho
on
the
ores
from
which
the
extraneous
material
has
been
roughly
separated
to
the
puget
sound
refineries

a
maximum
of
per
ton
for
a
distance
of
four
or
five
hundred
miles
and
the
rate
from
puget
sound
to
new
york
is
the
average
transportation
charge
therefore
being
about
per
ton
the
value
of
a

of
copper

a

of

a
pound

copper
passes
through
manifold
and
expensive
processes
and
its
extensive
consumption
has
followed
the
development
of
electricity
lead
does
not
require
so
many
or
so
expensive
workings
and
it
has
long
been
a
great
staple
of
general
use
the
mine
farther
from
a
smelter
naturally
has
to
pay
a
higher
rate
of
freight
than
a
mine
nearer
to
it
receiving
therefore
a
lesser
net
price
for
its
product
the
railroads
are
obliged
to
so
adjust
rates
that
practically
every
mine
can
reach
a
the
rate

been
in

of

the
aggregate
transportation
charge
on
this
bale
from
the
plantation
one
hundred

fifty
miles
from

is
mainly
because
of
the
rapid
shifting
of
the
sources
of
supply
there
has
not
yet
been
developed
a
stable
structure
of
rates
for
the
movement
of
lumber
in
all
parts
of
the
united
states
by
way
of
illustration
however
it
may
be
said
that
a
fair
average
rate
on
lumber
into
memphis
from
the
forests
of
arkansas
is
six
cents
per
pounds
or
per
feet
lumber
going
from
memphis
to
new
orleans
for
export
will
pay
or
a
total
transportation
charge
from
the
forest
of
per

a
fair
average
rate
to
the
markets
in
ohio
and
indiana
is
per

a
total
transportation
charge
from
the
forest
of
this
is
on
the
kind
of
lumber
that
in
and
sold
at
about
the
rate
on
yellow
pine
from
new
orleans
to
chicago
is
cents
per
pounds
there
is
an
equalization
of
rates
on
the
iron
ore
from
the
upper
lakes
in
that
the
rates
of
the
boat
lines
from
the
ore
mines
are
the
same
to
each
of
the
lake
erie
ports
from
thence
to
the
furnaces
they
are
adjusted
under
the
policy
of
the
railroads
to
make
the
transportation
charge
on
the
raw
material
required
to
make
a
ton
of
pig
iron
approximate
the
same
amount
at
each
of
the
competing
furnaces
of
southern
ohio
pittsburg
wheeling
in
the
mahoning
and
shenango
valleys
and
even
as
far
as
the
schuylkill
valley
how
closely
this
equalization
is
effected
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
transportation
charge
on
the
ore
coke
and
limestone
required
to
produce
one
ton
of
is
as
follows
in
these
respective
districts
at
the
furnaces
on
the
monongahela
river
in
the
pittsburg
district
at
the
furnaces
of
the
mahoning
and
shenango
valleys
at
the
furnaces
of
the
wheeling
district
these
charges
compare
favorably
with
those
at
the
furnaces
on
the
lake
shore
in
the
chicago
district
which
aggregate
per
ton
of
but
are
higher
than
at
the
furnaces
on
the
lake
shore
in
the
cleveland
district
where
they
aggregate
but
the
rates
on
coal
which
gives
return
loads
to
the
cars
that
take
the
ore
south
front
the
lake
erie
ports
are
maintained
at
established
differences
between
the
coal
fields
of
ohio
pittsburg
and
west
virginia
the
rates
in
effect
in
the
spring
of
were
per
ton
from
southern
ohio
cents
from
southeastern
ohio
per
ton
from
the
pittsburg
field
and
a
ton
from
west
virginia
the
claim
of
the
railroads
that
the
rates
on
foodstuffs
are
not
high
enough
to
enter
as
a
factor
in
fixing
the
selling
price
is
fully
substantiated
by
the
statements
of
the
dealers
in
such
products
that
is
the
conditions
are
with
negligible
exceptions
such
that
if
the
price
obtainable
in
the
markets
be
sufficient
to
encourage
the
growing
of
livestock
grains
dairy
products
fruits
or
vegetables
the
rate
of
freight
from
whatever
locality
to
whatever
market
is
sufficiently
low
to
allow
the
producer
to
enter
that
market
his
profits
are
however
as
a
matter
of
course
diminished
by
the
amount
of
freight
which
he
pays
and
as
a
rule
the
farther
the
place
of
production
from
the
markets
the
greater
is
the
freight
charge
the
differences
in
the
net
return
to
the
producer
are
almost
invariably
reflected
in
the
value
of
the
land
which
is
lower
as
the
distance
from
the
markets
is
greater
largely
because
of
the
defective
system
of
mercantile
distribution
the
grower
of
foodstuffs
obtains
a
smaller
proportion
of
the
price
paid
by
the
consumer
than
accrues
to
the
grower
of
any
other
agricultural
product
where
as
in
this
country
the
opportunity
for
the
extension
of
cultivation
is
practically
unlimited
a
good
market
one
season
leads
the
farmers
of
any
district
to
increase
their
production
up
to
the
point
of
minimum
profit
and
the
railroads
are
then
besought
for
lower
rates
when
unfavorable
weather
or
other
conditions
reduce
their
output
they
are
also
disgruntled
it
therefore
rarely
happens
that
the
grower
especially
of
the
quickly
perishable
foodstuffs
is
entirely
satisfied
with
the
freight
rates
a
controversy
that
it
is
scarcely
an
exaggeration
to
designate
as
typical
occurred
several
years
ago
between
the
growers
of
watermelons
in
a
southwestern
state
and
the
railroads
conveying
the
melons
to
the
primary
markets
in
comparatively
a
few
years
that
region
had
become
so
productive
that
the
shipments
of
watermelons
over
one
road
alone
ranged
from
to
cars
during
a
watermelon
season
deliveries
being
made
all
over
ohio
and
indiana
through
dealers
from
those
states
who
came
down
and
bought
the
melons
at
the
farms
the
contention
for
lower
rates
had
waxed
so
warm
that
a
reduction
in
the
watermelon
rate
became
the
issue
upon
which
a
legislative
campaign
was
fought
the
candidate
pledged
to
secure
a
reduction
in
the
rate
was
elected
and
introduced
a
bill
which
was
enacted
by
the
legislature
making
the
rate
to
the
nearest
primary
market
cents
per
pounds
the
railroad
companies
put
this
rate
in
effect
and
used
it
as
a
basis
for
the
lowering
of
rates
to
the
territory
beyond
during
the
year
of
this
rate
reduction
the
traffic
department
of
the
railroad
company
referred
to
sent
word
to
the
farmers
that
the
company
had
handled
cars
of
melons
that
season
the
prompt
shipment
of
which
had
been
highly
satisfactory
to
the
growers
it
furthermore
said
that
the
movement
of
these
melons
from
that
territory
was
a
traffic
entirely
it
being
necessary
to
send
special
cars
empty
for
the
crop
these
were
necessarily
stock
cars
that
there
might
be
ample
ventilation
but
they
had
to
be
supplied
with
extra
slats
in
order
that
the
melons
might
not
fall
out
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
be
switched
in
requisite
number
on
side
tracks
especially
built
adjoining
the
farms
where
the
fruit
was
grown
that
switching
engines
be
kept
at
work
putting
cars
in
and
taking
cars
out
all
night
and
all
day
the
cars
of
melons
moreover
had
to
be
hauled
on
special
trains
at
a
high
rate
of
speed
to
get
them
to
the
markets
before
they
spoiled
this
reduced
the
tonnage
per
train
fifteen
or
twenty
per
cent
below
the
maximum
that
could
be
hauled
at
the
normal
freight
train
speed
a
car
with
the
average
allowable
load
of
watermelons
would
contain
but
about
twelve
tons
although
its
capacity
would
be
eighteen
or
twenty
tons
the
weight
of
the
car
exceeded
the
weight
of
the
load
the
switching
and
other
special
movements
necessitated
the
employment
of
night
telegraph
operators
and
other
extra
help
at
the
melon
fields
all
of
these
conditions
led
the
assistant
to
the
general
manager
of
the
company
to
make
an
analysis
of
the
expenditure
as
compared
with
the
earnings
waybills
were
abstracted
and
the
receipts
listed
a
tabulation
was
made
of
the
revenue
tonnage
the
gross
tonnage
the
tare
weight
and
the
expenses
incurred
in
behalf
of
the
traffic
he
found
that
the
handling
of
the
cars
of
watermelons
involved
a
loss
to
the
company
of
if
the
expenses
of
operation
alone
were
considered
the
results
of
this
investigation
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
traffic
department
and
the
next
spring
it
sent
a
circular
to
the
farmers
in
the
truck
region
urging
that
the
watermelon
acreage
be
reduced
as
the
rates
on
that
business
were
not
remunerative
and
stating
that
the
railroad
would
not
undertake
to
handle
it
except
in
the
regular
cars
that
were
brought
into
the
territory
in
the
ordinary
course
of
traffic
that
there
would
be
no
special
trains
nor
special
service
of
any
character
the
melon
growers
at
once
notified
the
state
railroad
commission
which
in
turn
requested
the
railroad
company
and
the
melon
growers
to
attend
a
meeting
to
discuss
the
whole
subject
when
the
meeting
convened
the
chairman
called
upon
the
railroads
to
say
why
they
had
caused
so
much
trouble
the
railroad
representative
who
was
the
aforesaid
assistant
to
the
general
manager
stated
that
as
he
had
been
invited
to
attend
the
meeting
it
might
be
proper
for
whomsoever
instigated
it
to
open
the
discussion
several
shippers
made
statements
of
their
complaints
all
admitting
however
that
the
melon
business
had
become
very
profitable
one
grower
saying
that
to
per
car
was
being
made
out
of
a
crop
the
railroad
representative
then
made
a
reply
showing
the
loss
to
the
company
from
handling
the
business
for
the
previous
year
and
stated
that
unless
cost
for
the
handling
and
something
by
way
of
profit
could
be
obtained
the
company
would
prefer
to
move
other
crops
he
showed
that
it
had
been
necessary
to
park
to
especially
prepared
stock
cars
in
the
melon
territory
that
it
had
taken
a
month
or
six
weeks
to
gather
these
cars
which
had
to
be
hauled
empty
to
the
melon
fields
he
then
pointed
out
that
the
rate
per
melon
was
less
than
a
cent
and
a
quarter
whereas
it
had
cost
the
farmer
four
or
five
cents
per
melon
to
bring
it
by
wagon
the
one
or
two
or
three
miles
to
the
railroad
track
the
chairman
objected
to
some
of
the
analyses
especially
to
the
contrast
of
four
or
five
cents
per
melon
for
the
wagon
haul
from
the
farm
with
the
cent
or
a
cent
and
a
half
per
melon
for
the
railroad
haul
of
two
hundred
miles
when
the
railroad
man
had
finished
farmers
from
all
over
the
room
began
to
ask
questions
directly
of
him
they
wanted
to
know
how
much
they
should
pay
to
afford
the
railroad
some
slight
profit
they
were
told
or
cents
the
chairman
said
the
rate
can
not
be
changed
it
has
been
fixed
by
law
at
cents
and
that
is
the
rate
i
am
here
to
protect
the
people
of
these
counties
the
railroad
man
suggested
that
his
company
might
be
willing
in
addition
to
affix
the
necessary
slats
to
the
stock
cars
and
perform
the
switching
for
to
per
car
the
farmers
were
willing
to
accept
this
but
the
chairman
insisted
that
it
was
contrary
to
law
and
finally
said
in
his
wrath
if
you
men
here
are
going
to
deal
with
the
railroad
company
you
can
do
it
without
me
this
meeting
is
adjourned
with
one
exception
the
farmers
remained
in
the
hall
and
expressed
a
willingness
to
pay
a
rate
of
cents
per
pounds
returning
to
the
main
discussion
we
have
found
that
the
rates
on
raw
materials
are
so
adjusted
as
to
permit
the
manufacture
of
any
staple
article
at
any
logical
place
of
manufacture
on
the
raw
material
of
wearing
apparel
the
freight
rate
is
entirely
unimportant
on
the
lumber
that
enters
into
building
material
on
the
ore
coke
and
limestone
used
in
the
manufacture
of
iron
and
steel
the
freight
rate
is
sufficient
to
become
an
appreciable
factor
in
the
cost
of
manufacture
on
brick
coal
and
cement
the
selling
price
is
the
higher
by
the
amount
of
the
freight
charge
which
for
distances
sometimes
not
considerable
exceeds
the
value
of
the
commodity
at
the
place
of
production
the
freight
charge
even
on
those
heavier
commodities
however
is
far
less
in
proportion
to
the
wage
of
the
day
laborer
as
well
as
to
the
incomes
and
salaries
received
in
the
united
states
than
in
any
other
country
this
is
obviously
a
better
test
of
comparison
than
that
based
upon
rates
of
freight
as
expressed
in
money
to
say
that
a
specific
rate
is
twenty
cents
in
the
united
states
a
shilling
in
great
britain
a
franc
in
france
or
a
mark
in
germany
conveys
an
inadequate
idea
when
it
is
ascertained
that
the
average
wage
of
the
day
laborer
in
the
united
states
is
higher
in
comparison
with
the
average
rate
of
transportation
than
in
any
other
country
the
comparison
is
significant
in
this
country
a
continually
increasing
amount
of
railroad
transportation
can
be
purchased
with
the
wage
of
the
day
laborer
with
the
sum
of
money
representing
the
value
of
a
given
unit
of
any
of
the
staple
commodities
of
commerce
also
can
a
continually
increasing
amount
of
railroad
transportation
be
purchased
that
which
makes
possible
the
low
freight
rate
of
the
american
railroads
is
the
magnitude
of
the
scale
upon
which
the
transportation
is
conducted
the
large
cars
with
a
capacity
of
from
thirty
to
fifty
tons
and
the
powerful
locomotives
that
draw
a
score
or
more
of
these
loaded
cars
in
one
train
permit
an
almost
infinitesimal
freight
charge
per
pound
or
per
yard
that
however
yields
by
the
carload
or
by
the
trainload
no
inconsiderable
revenue
for
example
the
average
weight
of
the
carload
of
food
products
is
about
pounds
if
the
freight
on
such
a

there
is
scarcely
a
commodity
upon
which
a

of
one

makes
any
difference
in

specific
complaint
in
regard
to
the
freight
rates
of
the
united
states
for
many
years
has
not
except
in
a
small
minority
of
cases
been
based
on
the
ground
that
they
have
prevented
foodstuffs
from
finding
a
market
raw
material
from
reaching
places
of
manufacture
or
finished
products
from
distribution
while
the
difference
of
a
cent
or
two
in
the
rate
of
freight
may
not
in
the
least
interfere
with
the
conduct
of
industry
or
commerce
in
the
aggregate
such
a
slight
difference
may
perhaps
determine
whether
a
manufacturer
obtain
his
raw
material
from
this
or
that
source
of
supply
whether
a
wholesale
dealer
obtain
his
stock
from
the
manufacturer
in
one
or
the
manufacturer
in
another
city
whether
a
retail
dealer
make
his
purchases
from
the
wholesale
dealer
in
this
city
or
in
that
city
that
is
for
example
the
prices
of
the
products
at
the
sources
of
supply
being
equal
a
difference
in
the
rate
of
freight
may
determine
whether
cleveland
ohio
obtain
potatoes
from
michigan
or
from
upper
new
york
whether
a
factory
in
louisville
obtain
coal
from
the
fields
of
southern
indiana
or
central
kentucky
a
carpenter
in
des
moines
may
perhaps
pay
a
dollar
for
twenty
pounds
of
nails
without
knowing
or
caring
what
the
freight
rate
may
have
been
or
where
they
may
have
come
from
a
difference
however
of
a
few
cents
a
hundred
pounds
in
the
rate
of
freight
may
have
led
the
hardware
dealer
to
have
purchased
the
nails
in
chicago
or
louis
or
even
directly
from
pittsburg
as
the
purchase
of
raw
material
tends
toward
the
prosperity
of
the
region
where
it
is
produced
as
the
operation
of
a
factory
tends
to
the
increase
of
population
to
appreciation
in
the
value
of

and
the
augmentation
of

at
the
place
of
its
location
so
also
does
the

of
a
wholesale
business
or
of
a
retail
business
aid
in
the
development
of
its
surroundings
producers
manufacturers
wholesalers
and
retailers
naturally
all
desire
to
extend
their
sales
to
reach
further
markets
in
competition
with
their
rivals
and
are
supported
in
this
desire
by
the
communities
to
whose
welfare
they
contribute
any
difference
in
freight
rates
that
gives
a
producer
of
raw
material
a
manufacturer
a
wholesale
distributer
or
a

merchant
an
advantage
over
a
competitor
of
another

is
therefore
promptly
made
the
subject
of
complaint
the
pressure
brought
upon
the
railroads
by
such
competing
producers
manufacturers
and
dealers
has
been
a
very
important
factor
in
the
development
of
certain
arrangements
of
freight
rates
which
we
shall
term
the
regional
rate
structures
each
of
which
has
grown
out
of
the
various
characteristics
of

and
has
become
adapted

arrangements
of

together
with
the
reports
made
to
the
interstate

by
the
railroads
on

tend
to
show
that
as
a

the
railroad
property
of
the

is
worth
as
much
as
the

representing

that
in

the

places
the
huge
value
of
terminals
the
immense
expenditures
in
recent
years
in

brought
the

the
fact
of

worthy

now
listen
to
the
sober
words
of
the
one
man
who
has
perhaps
given
more
official
attention
to
the
subject
than
any
other
citizen
of
the
republic
without
regard
to
the
personnel
of
railroad
officials
without
regard
primarily
to
the
interest
of
stockholders
but
in
the
interest
of
public
welfare
and
national
prosperity
we
must
permit
railway
earnings
to
be
adequate
for
railroad
improvement
at
advantage
and
profit
to
my
mind
it
is
a
most
impressive
fact
so
great
as
to
elude
the
grasp
of
imagination
that
the
railway
traffic
of
the
country
fully
doubled
in
the
first
seven
years
of
this
twentieth
century
this
enormous
addition
to
the
volume
of
transportable
goods
overtaxed
as
you
know
the
existing
facilities
and
the
resulting
condition
perhaps
accounts
for
much
of
the
hostility
which
has
been
manifested
in
various
quarters
for
the
man
who
has
raised
something
by
hard
labor
or
made
something
with
painstaking
skill
which
he
could
sell
at
a
handsome
profit
in
an
eager
market
and
finds
that
he
can
not
get
it
carried
to
destination
and
so
sees
his
anticipated
gains
turned
into
a
positive
loss
is
naturally
exasperated
and
unthinkingly
it
on
the
railroads
and
is
ready
to
hit
them
with
anything
he
can
lay
his
hands
to
and
as
the
state
legislature
seemed
to
be
the
most
convenient
weapon
he
wielded
it
for
all
it
was
worth
i
dwell
upon
this
a
moment
further
because
it
seems
plain
to
me
that
the
prosperity
of
the
country
is
measured
and
will
be
measured
by
the
ability
of
its
railroads
and
waterways
to
transport
its
increasing
commerce
with
a
country
of
such
vast
extent
and
limitless
resources
with
all
the
means
of
production
developed
to
a
wonderful
state
of
efficiency
the
continued
advancement
of
this
great
people
depends
primarily
upon
such
an
increase
of
transportation
facilities
as
will
provide
prompt
and
safe
movement
everywhere
from
producer
to
consumer
and
that
we
shall
not
secure
unless
the
men
who
are
relied
upon
to
manage
these
great
highways
of
commerce
have
fitting
opportunity
and
the
capital
which
is
required
for

led
to
numerous
enterprises
securing

financial
support

owing
to
the
disaster
that
was
experienced
in

the

great

the

quote
the

statistics
of
railroad
growth
by
decades
since
the

miles
about
such
is
the
exhibit
of
progress
in
the
extent
of

broadly
viewed
with
the
growth
in
extent
the
elements
of
safety
have
multiplied
and
have
become
very
numerous
in
fact
an
almost
indefinite
subdivision
of
railroad
property
and
operation
in
respect
of
safety
might
be
conceived
we
will
consider
however
the
beginnings
and
the
growth
of
a
few
of
the
more
important
and
striking
items
and
their
relationship
to
the
state
of
the
art
as
portraying
in
a
more
graphic
manner
the
adjustment
if
you
may
call
it
such
of
safety
to
progress
or
as
the

has
been
assigned
to

together
with
the
weight
of

developed
following
upon
the
greater
transportation
to
be
undertaken
the
question
of
brakes
was
an
important
factor
more
efficient
brakes
were
needed
the
essential
characteristics
being
that
they
should
be
continuous

of

is

as
the

valve
brake
cylinder
and
train
line
application
was
made
by
admitting
air
from
the
main
reservoir
into
the
train
line
the
brakes
were
released
by
reducing
the
pressure
into
the
atmosphere
through
the
valve
the
brakes
were
useless
if
there
was
a
leak
a
burst
in
the
air
line
or
a
parted
train
with
these
shortcomings
in
mind
the
automatic
air
brake
was
produced
in
in
which
the
method
was
reversed
with
the
addition
of
an
auxiliary
reservoir
under
each
passenger
car
and
a
triple
valve
application
of
brakes
was
secured
by
reducing
the
pressure
while
admitting
air
from
the
main
reservoir
raised
the
pressure
and
released
the
brakes
on
the
application
of
the
automatic
air
brake
to
freight
cars
it
was
found
the
reduction
of
pressure
was
not
quick
enough
to
set
the
rear
brakes
promptly
and
in
consequence
accidents
occurred
from
the
bunching
of
the
cars
the
consideration
of
the
brake
question
by
the
master
car
association
in
and
public
tests
under
their
auspices
in
at
which
time
the
manufacturers
were
represented
did
not
succeed
in
stopping
freight
trains
without
violent
and
disastrous
shocks
so
discouraging
did
these
tests
seem
for
the
time
being
that
a
report
was
made
suggesting
that
the
successful
application
of
such
brakes
on
long
trains
could
only
be
accomplished
by
electricity
however
the
following
january
witnessed
the
introduction
of
the
westinghouse
air
brake
which
corrected
the
previous
trouble
and
made
practicable
the
application
of
air
brakes
to
long
freight
trains
continuing
from
this
time
there
has
been
marked
improvement
and
development
in
all
features
of
the
apparatus
without
however
modifying
the
essential
elements
of
which
it
is
constituted

the
solution
of
a
means
of

control
came
a
further
growth
in
their
size
and
weight
sooner
or
later
this
had
to
emphasize
the
necessity
for
efficient
coupling
devices
not
only
were
there
accidents
due
to
the
primitive
link
and
pin
couplers
but
the
various
standards
in
existence
both
complicated
the
operations
of
coupling
and
uncoupling
of
cars
and
involved
the
question
of
interchange
and
safety
automatic
couplers
owing
to
the
large
number
of
accidents
adams
of
the
boston
albany
railroad
recommended
to
the
master
car
association
at
its
third
convention
in
that
a
uniform
height
should
be
established
for
couplers
their
failure
to
meet
when
cars
came
together
being
considered
the
cause
of
numerous
accidents
in
that
convention
adopted
inches
as
the
standard
height
for
cars
at
the
convention
of
forney
urged
that
a
committee
investigate
the
cause
of
accidents
and
make
recommendation
this
committee
in
the
following
year
gave
as
the
principal
cause
the
same
as
reported
by
adams
eight
years
before
they
pronounced
the
tests
of
automatic
couplers
to
date
a
failure
another
committee
at
this
same
convention
gave
the
first
recognition
to
automatic
couplers
by
reporting
that
a
great
advantage
would
be
derived
from
a
uniform
drawbar
such
as
would
be
accepted
as
a
standard
and
which
would
be
a
during
several
years
following
various
models
were
examined
but
nothing
was
found
to
meet
the
demands
in

of
the

reported
that
his

intended
to
equip

with

at
the
same
meeting
garey
of
the
new

central
told
of
having
been
waited
upon
by
a
committee
of
yardmasters
asking
for
dead
blocks
or
some
such
safety
device
this
turned
the
attention
of
the
association
from
the
coupler
to
the
dead
block
in
the
year
following
they
invited
the
yardmasters
association
to
act
in
concert
with
their
committee
in
reporting
upon
means
of
safety
for
protection
of
yard
and
train
men
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
this
was
the
situation
when
on
march
the
massachusetts
legislature
instructed
the
railroad
commission
to
investigate
and
report
with
recommendation
as
to
means
of
prevention
of
accidents
in
the
coupling
of
cars
they
reported
that
they
preferred
to
be
guided
by
the
action
of
the
railroad
companies
and
any
device
made
standard
by
them
would
in
their
opinion
be
the
best
recommendation
for
such
device
in
the
connecticut
railroad
commissioners
recommended
to
the
legislature
that
automatic
couplers
be
required
on
all
new
cars
in
the
massachusetts
commissioners
expressed
the
hope
that
the
master
car
builders
association
would
at
its
convention
agree
upon
some
type
of
coupler
for
freight
cars
in
the
association
selected
forney
to
conduct
tests
of
automatic
couplers
and
report
attention
was
called
at
that
time
to
less
than
a
dozen
varieties
that
were
worthy
of
consideration
with
this
action
of
the
association
as
a
guide
the
massachusetts
commissioners
undertook
to
solve
the
problem
and
announced
that
they
would
not
prescribe
any
coupler
that
had
not
been
tested
in
actual
traffic
but
notified
the
railroad
companies
in
the
state
that
all
new
cars
and
cars
requiring
new
couplers
should
be
provided
with
one
of
five
kinds
specified
it

that
the
kinds
specified
would
not

other
in

were
held
at
buffalo
by

were
tested
twelve
of

were
recommended
for

tests
in
the
following

the
trials
made
of
power
brakes
on
freight
trains
made
it
very
evident
that
the
link
and
pin
type
of
coupling
would
not
suffice
and
it

came
with
the
increasing
traffic
and
speed
as
these
conditions
developed
in
england
before
they
did
here
the
first
steps
were
taken
in
that
country
in
the
liverpool
manchester
introduced
the
first
system
of
fixed
signals
consisting
of
an
upright
post
with
a
rotating
disk
at
its
top
showing
red
for
danger
and
the
absence
of
indication
by
day
and
a
white
light
by
night
for
clear
on
the
opening
of
the
great
western
railway
this
method
was
improved
experiments
by
chappe
the
inventors
of
optical
telegraphy
showed
that
under
certain
conditions
of
illumination
the
color
of
any
body
would
disappear
this
demonstrated
that
the
form
and
not
the
color
of
the
day
signal
could
be
relied
on
it
was
also
found
that
a
long
narrow
surface
could
be
seen
further
as
projected
against
the
horizon
or
landscape
than
the
same
area
in
a
square
or
circle
making
use
of
these
results
sir
charles
gregory
in
designed
and
erected
at
new
cross
the
first
semaphore
signal
there
was
no
communication
between
stations
each
signalman
displaying
his
signal
at
danger
after
the
passage
of
a
train
until
a
certain
time
had
elapsed
when
it
was
cleared
the
only
information
conveyed
to
the
engineman
was
that
the
preceding
train
had
passed
the
station
at
least
the
required
time
before
him
the
failure
or
inability
to
act
with
sufficient
promptness
at
the
display
of
the
danger
position
and
the
consequent
collisions
led
to
the
installation
of
additional
signals
to
give
advance
information
to
the
engineman
of
the
position
of
the
signal
he
was
to
obey
thus
we
have
clearly
portrayed
the
inception
of
the
present
block
and
caution
signals
walker
of
the
southwestern
company
introduced
the
bell
code
which
was
the
first
audible
method
of
communication
between
signal
stations
the
same
year
tyer
supplemented
this
with
electric
visual
signals
the
object
being
to
give
the
operator
indication
of
the
signal
having
been
received
and
given
and
at
all
times
to
show
the
exact
position
of
the
signal
itself
this
suggested
the
space
interval
between
trains
in
place
of
the
time
interval
making
signal
indications
definite
in
the
positive
block
system
was
established
in
england
based
on
the
space
interval
system
making
use
of
telegraph
communication
ashbel
welch
chief
engineer
of
the
united
new
jersey
canal
and
railroad
company
devised
and
installed
during
and
the
first
block
system
of
signals
in
this
country
on
the
line
between
philadelphia
and
new
brunswick
signal
stations
were
suitably
spaced
and
at
each
station
a
signal
was
provided
visible
as
far
as
possible
each
way
the
signal
itself
was
a
white
board
by
day
and
a
white
light
by
night
indicating
clear
shown
through
a
glass
aperture
two
feet
in
diameter
in
front
of
the
block
signal
box
for
the
danger
indication
a
red
screen
fell
to
cover
the
white
board
or
light
on
a
train
passing
a
station
the
signalman
released
the
screen
which
fell
by
gravity
and
did
not
raise
it
until
advised
by
telegraph
that
the
preceding
train
had
passed
the
next
station
thereby
maintaining
a
space
interval
thus
was
evolved
the
telegraph
block
system
still
generally
used
with
modifications
of
apparatus
and
signals
on
lines
of
light
traffic
elaborations
of
this
system
were
later
installed
following
more
closely
the
english
practice
perhaps
reaching
the
most
complete
development
upon
the
new
haven
and
new
york
central
lines
where
it
is
still
in
use
notwithstanding
numerous
improvements
in
apparatus
the
same
practice
of
fixing
a
positive
space
interval
by
means
of
communication
between
block
stations
still
holds
the
addition
of
track
circuits
for
locking
and
indicating
purposes
and
interlocking
between
stations
more
fully
effected
by
the
introduction
of
the
coleman
block
instrument
in
has
thus
evolved
the
controlled

system
as
now
used

in
thomas
hall
patented
an
electric
signal
and
alarm
bell
used
in
connection
with
a
switch
or
drawbridge
its
shortcoming
lay
in
the
fact
that
a
break
in
the
circuit
or
failure
of
the
latter
gave
no
danger
indication
to
correct
this
a
closed
circuit
was
necessary
although
more
expensive
in
wm
robinson
devised
the
plan
of
having
the
circuit
closed
at
the
point
of
danger
if
conditions
were
favorable
and
opened
a
short
distance
in
advance
of
the
signal
the
wheels
of
the
approaching
train
depressed
a
lever
which
closed
the
circuit
and
cleared
the
signal
unless
interrupted
at
the
point
of
danger
subsequent
modifications
were
made
whereby
the
circuit
once
completed
remained
so
through
the
agency
of
an
electromagnet
and
reopened
when
the
train
passed
out
of
that
portion
of
the
track
governed
by
the
signal
in
hall
put
in
operation
the
first
automatic
electric
block
system
on
the
new
york
harlem
railroad
between
the
grand
central
station
and
mott
haven
junction
it
was
normal
safety
the
wheels
of
a
passing
train
striking
a
lever
completed
a
circuit
which
put
the
signal
to
danger
after
the
train
and
held
it
so
until
the
succeeding
signal
went
to
danger
when
a
separate
circuit
was
completed
which
released
the
former
signal
allowing
it
to
return
to
clear
the
disadvantage
in
having
the
wheels
of
a
train
strike
a
lever
to
complete
the
circuit
led
pope
to
experiment
after
a
successful
attempt
in
transmitting
an
electric
circuit
through
an
ordinary
track
with
fishplate
joints
he
made
a
signal
test
at
east
cambridge
mass
a
section
of
track
was
insulated
from
the
rest
with
a
wire
circuit
including
a
battery
and
electromagnet
for
operating
the
signal
fastened
at
either
end
to
the
opposite
rails
the
metal
wheels
and
axles
completed
the
circuit
throwing
the
signal
to
danger
against
following
trains
a
detent
served
to
keep
the
circuit
closed
until
the
next
signal
was
reached
when
a
separate
circuit
released
the
detent
permitting
the
signal
to
clear
in
this
system
was
put
in
service
and
with
some
alterations
still
remains
in
some
localities
following
the
original
manual
semaphore
and
the
controlled
manual
system
of
operation
came
the
pneumatic
and
electric
systems
for
localities
which
required
a
great
number
of
signal
movements
with
the
development
of
motors
and
batteries
capable
of
economic
operation
automatic
signals
of
the
semaphore
type
have
been
successfully
and
widely
installed
in
the
semaphore
system
numerous
failures
have
occurred
due
to
the
formation
of
ice
and
sleet
upon
the
blades
this
has
led
to
the
introduction
of
the
upper
quadrant
operation
that
is
the
motion
of
the
signal
being
from
horizontal
to
an
upwardly
inclined
position
and
back
on
account
of
the
widespread
prevalence
of
electric
lighting
and
the
building
up
of
the
territory
adjacent
to
railroads
changes
in
the
color
indication
of
night
signals
have
been
adopted
generally
in
such
localities
using
green
instead
of
white
for
the
safety

interlocking
developing
with
the
manual
operation
of
signals
and
as
a
safeguard
against
mistakes
of
the
signalmen
interlocking

up
as
a
means
for
preventing
conflicting

being
given
at
the

england
led
at
first
after
a
trip
to
that
country
in
ashbel
welch
recommended
the
advantage
derived
from
the
english
method
of
operating
switches
and
signals
in
large
yards
and
terminals
where
the
entire
control
fell
to
one
man
so
located
as
to
be
in
touch
with
the
whole
situation
and
equipped
with
a
machine
that
would
not
permit
of
setting
up
conflicting
routes
the
plea
resulted
in
the
order
of
a
saxby
farmer
interlocking
machine
which
was
installed
in
on
the
new
jersey
division
of
his
line
railroads
were
prompt
to
see
its
advantage
and
in
a
short
time
machines
performing
the
functions
were
made
and
installed
in
this
country
not
only
for
the
protection
of
railroad
intersections
but
for
the
control
of
large
terminal
layouts
in
the
first
interlocking
system
was
perfected
which
was
the
pneumatic
type
in
an
interlocking
system
advantageous
where
distant
functions
were
to
be
embraced
within
the
operation
of
the
plant
and
applicable
to
localities
where
electric
traction
was
in
use
was
devised
the
more
recent
development
of
interlocking
systems
with
complete
electric
indication
of
the
conditions
on
all
tracks
has
made
it
possible
for
larger
systems
to
be
consolidated
under
the
control
of
a
central
plant
and
thus
under
the
direction
of
a
central
authority
these
machines
being
of
a
completely
interlocked
character
insure
greater
safety
by
the
central
control
as
well
as
greater
facility
of
operation
train
dispatching
in
this
country
the
first
radical
departure
from
the
time
interval
and
flagging
method
of
operation
came
in
the
new
york
erie
railroad
had
established
a
single
line
of
telegraph
between
piermont
on
the
hudson
river
and
dunkirk
on
lake
erie
for
company
business
the
superintendent
of
telegraph
luther
tillottson
and
the
division
superintendent
were
together
in
the
elmira
depot
on
an
occasion
and
learned
that
the
westbound
express
from
new
york
was
four
hours
late
at
corning
an
eastbound
stock
train
and
a
westbound
freight
at
elmira
waited
for
the
express
with
this
information
tillottson
suggested
that
the
freight
train
at
elmira
could
be
sent
to
corning
and
the
stock
train
at
that
point
ordered
to
elmira
with
perfect
safety
before
the
arrival
of
the
express
the
move
was
successful
and
encouraged
similar
operation
which
shortly
led
to
the
adoption
with
some
modifications
of
this
method
on
the
susquehanna
division
of
the
erie
its
adoption
over
the
entire
line
followed
in
spite
of
the
great
opposition
which
charles
minot
the
general
superintendent
met
when
planning
for
its
introduction
some
of
the
conductors
and
enginemen
went
so
far
as
to
resign
rather
than
run
on
telegraphic
orders
against
the
time
of
another
train
this
system
spread
rapidly
to
other
lines
and
in
company
with
other
features
of
railroad
operation
has
been
progressively
developed
and
improved
one
of
the
important
elements
of
safety
in
the
dispatching
practice
has
been
the
tendency
to
the
same
words
in
the
same
sequence
to
convey
the
same
instructions
insuring
a
uniform
understanding
of
the
instructions
instead
of
permitting
a
discretionary
phraseology
in
originating
or
a
misunderstanding
in
construing
the
order
transmitted
the
rules
for
train
dispatching
now
prescribe
the
use
of
standard
forms
of
expression
for
orders
governing
the
movement
of
trains
within
the
past
few
years
experiments
have
been
made
with
a
system
of
train
dispatching
by
telephone
now
in
successful
operation
upon
some
important
lines
and
growing
in
extent
advantage
lies
in
the
ability
to
use
trained
railroad
employes
who
can
not
work
under
the
telegraph
system
not
being
telegraph
operators
the
system
not
only
insures
a
rapid
distribution
of
information
but
by
its
greater
capacity
enables
a
more
complete
knowledge
of
the
state
of
the

to
be
had
in
the

it

take
up

with
the
recital
even
in

form
of
the
development
of
all
the
items
which
go
to
make
up
the
parts
of
a
railroad
we
can
not
forego
the
opportunity
to
speak
briefly
about
the
locomotive
the
motive
power
giving
action
and
effect
to
transportation
as
early
as
sir
isaac
newton
predicted
carriages
and
even
made
suggestions
bearing
on
their
design
through
the
eighteenth
century
various
types
of
steam
vehicles
appeared
more
as
curiosities
than
anything
else
some
of
them
forerunners
of
the
locomotive
and
others
of
the
automobile
it
was
not
until
that
anything
really
deserving
the
name
locomotive
was
built
richard
trevithick
a
cornish
miner
constructed
the
locomotive
bearing
his
name
curiously
enough
as
the
result
of
a
wager
on
trial
this
machine
did
convey
ten
tons
of
iron
for
nine
miles
on
a
tramway
by
steam
power
winning
the
wager
the
desire
of
christopher
blackett
a
mine
owner
to
use
steam
motive
power
in
place
of
animals
led
to
the
practical
demonstration
of
adhesion
on
this
principle
blackett
superintendent
william
hedley
built
his
puffing
billy
a
complicated
affair
of
levers
beams
and
gears
on
the
completion
of
the
liverpool
manchester
railroad
the
directors
being
undecided
as
to
the
motive
power
offered
a
prize
of
five
hundred
pounds
for
a
locomotive
that
would
fulfill
certain
conditions
the
test
came
off
at
rainhill
in
october
on
a
level
piece
of
track
about
one
and
miles
long
between
four
competitors
rocket
won
and
gave
the
world
the
mechanical
combination
essentially
represented
in
locomotive
practice
since
that
time
american
locomotive
practice
followed
the
stephenson
model
among
the
early
builders
were
phineas
davis
ross
winans
and
matthias
baldwin
the
engines
of
the
english
type
proved
injurious
to
the
light
rail
and
sharp
curves
on
our
early
roads
and
to
overcome
this
john
jervis
chief
engineer
of
the
mohawk
hudson
railroad
introduced
the
bogie
truck
for
some
twenty
years
this
design
remained
until
in
the
the
demand
for
more
tractive
power
brought
about
the
addition
of
another
pair
of
coupled
drivers
thus
evolving
the
american
type
additional
drivers
were
added
with
the
demand
for
increased
tractive
power
leading
in
turn
to
the
development
of
the
mogul
and
consolidated
types
in
the
decade
between
and
more
drivers
such
as
in
the
type
began
to
be
used
in
service
and
the
adaptation
of
wide
to
the
american
type
necessitated
the
addition
of
a
trailer
truck
to
support
the
rear
end
of
the
locomotive
frame
and
brought
about
the
atlantic
type
in
the
pacific
type
or
the
most
modern
passenger
locomotive
is
a
development
of
this
in
anatole
mallett
designed
the
articulated
locomotive
in
the
first
one
of
this
type
was
placed
in
operation
on
an
american
railroad
and
since
that
time
has
gained
favor
where
maximum
tractive
power
on
heavy
grades
is
required
there
is
perhaps
no
more
striking
illustration
of
the
progress
of
the
art
than
can
be
obtained
from
an
examination
of
the
illustrations
of
the
various
types
of
locomotives
built
and
operated
since
it
all
bespeaks
a
tremendous
growth
based
on
a
tremendous
necessity
we
can
point
to
the
strengthening
of
all
parts
commensurate
with
the
work
to
be
done
to
the
perfection
of
detail
in
materials
manufacture
maintenance
and
inspection
and
possibly
observe
with
pride
that
the
motive
power
of
the
railroads
of
the
present
contributes
an
almost
negligible
part
of
the
difficulties
of
modern
railroad
operation
due
to
features
of
design
or
control
car
construction
one
of
the
early
problems
in
transportation
was
to
secure
the
carrying
capacity
of
cars
as
well
as
safety
we
have
pointed
out
how
it
was
necessary
to
add
a
guiding
truck
to
the

to
adapt
the

locomotive
safely
to
american
conditions
both
the
excessive
wheel
loads
on
freight
cars
and
the
greater
liability
to
accident
or
derailment
led
at
an
early
time
to
the
use
of
trucks
under
cars
between

the

for
axles
and
the
application
of
the
draft
gear
to
the
car
body
and
not
to
the
trucks
the
increase
in
lengths
of
passenger
cars
with
corresponding
increases
in
weight
led
about
to
the
quite
general
employment
of
a
truck
instead
of
a
truck
and
even
trucks
were
used
for
a
time
but
rejected
on
account
of
the
excessive
length
of
wheel
base
and
other
complications
in
the
allen
wheel
consisting
of
construction
with
tire
was
introduced
and
rapidly
became
applied
to
cars
in
the
most
exacting
service
originally
the
tires
were
imported
from
the
krupp
works
in
germany
but
later
were
manufactured
here
great
interest
attaches
itself
at
the
present
time
to
the
manufacture
of
forged
wheels
on
account
of
the
reduction
in
parts
in
the
latter
experiments
were
made
in
the
development
of
steel
framing
for
car
construction
and
steel
underframes
were
introduced
shortly
after
at
first
on
cars
for
mineral
traffic
where
excessive
weights
and
capacities
were
required
the
success
of
this
type
of
construction
has
led
to
its
adaptation
at
the
present
time
to
all
classes
of
equipment
and
not
only
steel
underframes
but
complete
steel
construction
in
certain
classes
of
service
where
the
conditions
require
with
the
increase
in
through
passenger
service
we
note
the
appearance
of
the
vestibule
protecting
the
communication
between
cars
originally
this
vestibule
was
narrow
about
the
width
of
the
car
door
and
was
introduced
about
although
experimented
with
as
far
back
as
the
equipment
of
the
exposition
flyer
operated
from
new
york
to
chicago
during
the
world
fair
was
the
first
we
believe
to
appear
with
vestibules
these
being
originally
designed
as
offering
less
atmospheric
resistance
to
trains
but
having
subsequently
been
found
a
more
economical
attractive
and
safer
form
of
construction
the
question
of
steel
cars
and
composite
steel
and
wooden
cars
is
having
very
careful
investigation
and
experiment
at
the
present
time
while
considerably
used
the
results
of
the
use
of
these
cars
must
be
awaited
after
the
factor
of
safety
has
been
determined
the
question
of
tare
weight
per
passenger
carried
will
naturally
arise
in
this
country
our
weights
are
now
far
in
excess
of
all
foreign
railroad
practice
this
enters
into
the
resistance
and
cost
to
produce
the
service
car
heating
the
original
method
of
heating
passenger
cars
by
direct
radiation
from
coal
or
wood
stoves
was
a
source
of
discomfort
to
the
passengers
as
well
as
a
menace
in
case
of
disaster
this
brought
about
in
the
late
the
introduction
of
the
baker
heater
which
was
a
great
improvement
for
the
comfort
of
passengers
but
still
left
a
fire
in
the
car
in
many
instances
of
collisions
and
derailments
during
this
period
especially
in
winter
the
cars
were
set
on
fire
and
the
wreckage
consumed
from
the
fire
scattered
from
the
stoves
or
heaters
experimentally
steam
from
the
locomotives
was
used
but
the
difficulties
in
securing
satisfactory
couplings
between
the
cars
the
drain
on
the
boiler
and
the
fact
that
the
locomotive
was
sometimes
detached
from
the
train
were
obstacles
one
of
the
western
roads
even
attached
a
separate
car
for
the
sole
purpose
of
supplying
heat
and
light
the
growth
in
the
capacity
of
locomotive
boilers
and
the
perfection
of
the
couplings
between
cars
have
led
to
the
present
practice
of
car
heating
which
entirely
eliminates
the
presence
of
any
fire
or
source
of
danger
from
that
source
car
lighting
car
lighting
has
passed
through
the
same
stages
as
house
lighting
possibly
more
gradually
on
account
of
the
greater
difficulties
the
old
passenger
cars
were
illuminated
by
candles
about
two
inches
in
diameter
placed
in
racks
along
the
sides
of
the
car
with
the
advent
of
mineral
oil
just
before
the
civil
war
the
candles
gave
place
to
oil
lamps
great
difficulty
was
experienced
in
maintaining
a
steady
flame
until
the
principle
of
the
student
lamp
was
adopted
the
flame
was
shielded
from
the
outside
air
by
a
chimney
and
the
central
draft
to
the
burner
provided
the
air
necessary
at
the
right
point
to
insure
combustion
for
more
than
fifteen
years
this
method
prevailed
and
while
the
presence
of
oil
lamps
in
wrecks
contributed
fuel
to
the
flames
the
proof
that
they
were
in
any
way
the
principal
cause
was
lacking
still
to
eliminate
this
contributory
feature
attempts
were
made
to
use
ordinary
coal
gas
compressed
in
tanks
on
each
car
this
however
proved
unsatisfactory
in
a
system
of
compressed
gas
made
from
crude
petroleum
had
been
invented
by
julius
pintsch
of
berlin
and
by
had
been
put
into
a
number
of
cars
on
european
railroads
the
light
was
too
dim
to
satisfy
american
conditions
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
however
for
its
proper
and
adequate
development
to
our
needs
when
its
use
became
general
on
the
perfection
of
the
lamp
and
burner
for
the
last
fifteen
years
electric
lighting
of
various
types
has
been
in
use
on
cars
in
an
experimental
way
while
possessing
advantages
perhaps
in
safety
owing
to
low
voltages
and
small
quantity
of
current
its
general
use
has
not
yet
been
entirely
practicable
owing
to
the
complications
involved
either
in
generating
and
satisfactorily
controlling
the
current
upon
the
cars
or
in
supplying
it
at
terminals
through
storage
batteries
so
far
we
have
been
considering
largely
features
either
of
equipment
or
train
control
perhaps
more
important
than
these
is
the
permanent
way
compared
with
engines
cars
signals
and
dispatching
the
variety
of
problems
presented
in
the
construction
and
maintenance
are
many
we
perhaps
owe
to
the
ancient
beginnings
and
highly
scientific
development
of
the
profession
of
civil
engineering
and
its
branches
the
fact
that
these
problems
of
construction
and
maintenance
are
so
well
met
and
the
source
of
so
little
anxiety
in
connection
with
railroad
transportation
at
the
present
time
american
engineering
ingenuity
and
courage
have
devised
structures
to
meet
every
requirement
of
railroad
development
in
bridge
construction
for
centuries
the
simple
beam
or
the
arch
were
the
only
spans
employed
the
natural
barriers
to
construction
of
railroads
required
something
more
than
either
between
and
many
wooden
trusses
were
built
in
the
eastern
and
middle
states
after
the
design
of
burr
and
palmer
long
introduction
of
in
truss
construction
in
was
a
long
step
in
advance
and
after
ten
years
the
celebrated
howe
truss
was
brought
out
by
the
inventor
four
years
later
came
the
pratt
truss
in
several
riveted
lattice
trusses
were
built
for
the
new
york
central
varying
from
to
feet
in
length
by
howard
carroll
the
lehigh
valley
built
a
bridge
of
span
this
progress
in
truss
construction
enabled
the
railroads
to
bridge
streams
and
secure
continuous
roadway
as
an
interesting
historical
note
in
connection
with
railroad
bridges
we
find
that
the
first
railroad
bridge
was
built
across
the
mississippi
river
at
rock
island
in
it
had
hardly
been
completed
at
great
expense
before
louis
steamboat
interests
demanded
its
removal
as
a
nuisance
and
an
obstruction
to
navigation
the
united
states
district
court
so
adjudged
it
and
ordered
its
removal
within
six
months
the
presiding
judge
in
his
opinion
stated
that
if
one
railroad
is
able
to
transfer
freight
and
passengers
without
delay
and
expense
of
changing
at
the
river
financial
necessity
will
compel
competing
roads
to
provide
themselves
with
the
same
facilities
which
led
him
to
foresee
great
interference
to
river
traffic
and
great
mischief
in
the
establishment
of
such
a
precedent
the
case
was
appealed
and
abraham
lincoln
was
the
counsel
for
the
bridge
company
before
the
united
states
supreme
court
he
argued
that
both
the
river
and
the
railroad
were
great
highways
for
the
people
and
while
at
the
immediate
time
the
water
traffic
was
possibly
greater
he
predicted
that
the
time
might
come
when
the
railroads
might
equal
or
exceed
the
traffic
on
the
river
and
he
consequently
felt
that
each
interest
was
entitled
to
equal
consideration
his
broad
grasp
of
the
subject
secured
for
his
company
a
reversal
of
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
the
bridge
remained
with
the
advent
of
steel
the
possibilities
of
bridge
construction
may
be
said
to
have
become
almost
unlimited
and
their
design
exceedingly
simplified
and
standardized
evolution
of
the
rail
equally
important
is
the
evolution
of
the
rail
and
its
fastenings
the
type
of
metal
rails
of
which
the
bottom
served
as
the
running
surface
for
flat
wheels
guided
by
a
flange
on
the
rail
gave
place
to
edge
rails
on
which
flanged
wheels
used
the
upper
surface
of
the
rail
before
the
day
of
the
steam
locomotive
of
the
edge
type
the
first
were
cast
iron
in
sections
about
three
feet
in
length
they
were
supported
by
stone
blocks
or
in
chairs
which
were
in
turn
made
secure
to
the
stone
later
the
same
type
was
made
of
wrought
iron
by
john
birkinshaw
in
england
who
rolled
it
up
to
or
feet
in
length
from
to
the
flat
strap
rail
spiked
to
longitudinal
timbers
in
turn
supported
by
was
largely
used
in
this
country
as
it
was
the
only
shape
that
could
be
rolled
here
in
strickland
designed
the
bridge
or
u
section
which
was
used
on
some
of
our
earlier
roads
and
was
the
first
style
of
edge
rail
rolled
in
this
country
in
the
present
t
section
was
invented
in
by
colonel
stevens
chief
engineer
of
the
camden
amboy
railway
and
until
when
it
was
first
rolled
in
this
country
had
to
be
imported
from
england
the
poor
quality
of
the
iron
at
this
time
required
such
a
broad
support
in
the
design
of
the
rail
for
the
head
that
no
satisfactory
plate
fastening
could
be
secured
iron
shoes
into
which
the
rail
ends
fitted
were
the
means
of
connection
the
greatest
improvement
dates
from
when
the
first
steel
rails
were
rolled
in
england
ten
years
later
they
were
experimentally
rolled
here
in
through
the
introduction
of
the
bessemer
process
which
made
possible
their
manufacture
at
a
greatly
reduced
cost
began
a
revolution
in
track
construction
while
the
decade
from
to
witnessed
the
greatest
rate
of
railroad
building
in
this
country
it
also
witnessed
the
substantial
substitution
of
steel
rails
on
our
lines
the
earlier
rails
weighed
from
to
pounds
per
yard
the
increasing
weight
of
equipment
brought
out
a
heavier
section
and
fifteen
years
ago
there
was
a
large
percentage
of
mileage
on
which
weights
of
pounds
and
over
and
even
pounds
per
yard
had
been
introduced
under
special
conditions
rails
weighing
as
high
as
pounds
per
yard
are
used
with
the
increasing
weights
of
rails
and
the
development
of
steel
manufacture
greater
attention
has
been
paid
to
details
of
analysis
process
of
manufacture
shape
and
laying
and
it
may
be
briefly
stated
that
all
these
matters
are
uniformly
prescribed
at
the
present
time
our
rail
fastenings
ties
and
ballast
have
kept
pace
with
the
development
of
the
rail
and
equipment
an
orthodox
part
of
the
rules
governing
the
maintenance
of
railway
property
places
in
the
hands
of
the
maintenance
force
standard
plans
and
specifications
not
only
for
the
elements
such
as
rail
and
ties
but
for
the
complete
of
the
finished
track
structure
and
roadbed
and
these
plans
are
the
result
of
current
experience
and
study
of
the
several
railroads
and
of
the
various
associations
of
engineers
maintenance
officers
and
manufacturers
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
these
plans
specifications
and
standard
practices
represent
the
best
known
state
of
the
art
elimination
in
the
early
days
both
the
railroads
and
public
ways
used
the
natural
surface
of
the
ground
as
a
matter
of
economy
the
public
question
then
was
how
they
were
to
get
the
railroads
and
how
they
were
to
restrict
them
in
the
manner
of
their
construction
the
districts
traversed
were
sparsely
settled
and
trains
were
few
and
slow
in
their
movement
the
highways
were
little
used
all
of
which
made
for
freedom
from
accident
where
the
two
crossed
the
conditions
in
england
were
vastly
different
there
the
country
was
thickly
settled
and
an
assured
traffic
was
evident
from
the
inception
of
the
enterprise
which
would
warrant
expenditures
on
original
construction
that
could
not
be
entertained
by
the
promoters
of
our
first
companies
so
it
was
not
through
any
blindness
that
made
grade
crossings
grow
up
in
this
country
but
it
was
purely
the
result
of
economic
conditions
which
precluded
their
elimination
with
the
increase
in
population
and
the
development
of
the
country
came
the
need
of
increased
transportation
facilities
more
frequent
faster
and
heavier
trains
were
moving
up
the
railroads
and
a
greater
number
of
people
came
to
use
the
highways
the
inevitable
result
followed
and
at
length
the
great
number
of
accidents
occurring
at
the
grade
crossings
attracted
public
attention
the
legislature
of
massachusetts
took
the
first
action
in
when
it
provided
for
the
appointment
of
a
railroad
commission
to
investigate
and
report
upon
safer
and
better
methods
of
construction
and
operation
they
very
promptly
took
up
the
question
at
this
time
in
massachusetts
there
was
mile
of
track
to
square
miles
new
york
there
was
mile
of
track
to
square
miles
united
states
there
was
mile
of
track
to
square
miles
great
britain
there
was
mile
of
track
to
square
miles
this
showed
that
the
railroad
network
in
massachusetts
was
more
extensive
in
proportion
to
the
area
of
the
state
than
existed
in
great
britain
in
their
report
the
commission
suggested
the
avoidance
of
future
crossings
of
railroads
and
highways
at
grade
and
the
propriety
of
the
railroads
changing
some
existing
crossings
which
presented
no
great
difficulty
or
expense
in
a
law
was
passed
providing
for
the
separation
of
grade
when
a
town
and
railroad
effected
an
agreement
the
cost
was
to
be
apportioned
by
a
commission
appointed
by
the
superior
court
this
law
did
accomplish
something
but
hardly
abolished
existing
crossings
as
fast
as
new
ones
were
built
under
it
the
fitchburg
railroad
did
away
with
between
and
bearing
varying
portions
of
the
expense
in
an
act
provided
that
the
county
commissioners
could
order
the
abolition
of
a
grade
crossing
on
a
petition
of
twenty
legal
voters
if
the
cost
would
not
exceed
again
in
the
legislature
asked
the
governor
to
appoint
another
commission
to
investigate
and
report
upon
a
scheme
for
gradual
abolition
and
the
method
of
apportioning
the
expense
in
february
this
commission
composed
of
kimball
weber
and
locke
submitted
systematic
plans
with
estimates
in
which
they
fixed
forty
years
as
not
an
unreasonable
length
of
time
for
the
completion
of
the
work
the
next
step
came
in
with
the
passage
of
the
grade
crossing
law
which
provided
that
the
directors
of
a
railroad
or
the
authorities
of
a
town
or
city
could
petition
the
supreme
court
for
a
commission
on
the
abolition
of
a
grade
crossing
this
commission
was
to
determine
the
manner
of
the
separation
and
by
whom
the
work
was
to
be
done
and
how
the
expense
was
to
be
divided
as
between
the
railroad
city
and
state
before
the
report
was
presented
to
the
court
for
approval
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
commissioners
to
ascertain
that
the
aggregate
proportion
of
the
state
liability
in
this
connection
would
not
exceed
per
year
for
ten
years
while
on
the
one
hand
the
legislature
authorized
this
expenditure
of
to
abolish
the
crossings
of
highways
with
railroads
at
grade
they
granted
charters
indefinitely
to
electric
lines
to
cross
steam
roads
at
grade
the
new
york
state
board
of
railroad
commissioners
was
created
in
and
its
membership
appointed
by
the
governor
among
the
functions
which
they
immediately
assumed
was
the
question
of
public
safety
in
connection
with
crossings
at
grade
of
railroads
and
highways
the
consideration
which
this
received
and
the
complaints
of
unsafe
conditions
as
well
as
the
complications
and
adjudications
involved
led
to
the
passing
of
the
grade
crossing
law
which
went
into
effect
july
not
only
by
the
new
york
state
law
but
by
the
massachusetts
law
the
method
of
elimination
as
well
as
the
apportionment
of
expense
is
specific
the
initiative
is
open
to
both
the
railroad
and
to
the
community
and
the
rapid
progress
of
eliminations
in
these
two
states
may
be
taken
as
an
endorsement
of
the
wisdom
of
such
legislation
paving
the
way
as
it
does
for
more
progress
on
the
question
of
eliminations
than
it
is
believed
would
ordinarily
take
place
where
no
specific
rule
existed
for
the
undertaking
while
the
exact
conditions
throughout
the
country
are
not
definitely
known
it
is
believed
that
progress
is
being
made
quite
generally
in
this
direction
the
influence
of
elimination
upon
the
safety
of
operation
is
of
such
importance
as
to
deserve
serious
consideration
as
i
will
further
suggest
perhaps
the
elimination
of
grade
crossings
thereby
separating
the
public
from
the
railroad
except
as
authorized
in
connection
with
their
patronage
of
it
is
one
of
the
most
important
factors
as
safety
human
element
in
operation
notwithstanding
the
great
improvements
in
roadbed
track
bridges
signals
equipment
and
other
respects
all
securing
increased
service
and
safety
in
railroad
operation
the
human
element
is
a
vital
factor
with
a
view
of
raising
the
standard
of
individual
service
a
system
of
physical
and
educational
examinations
has
been
adopted
in
the
early
days
of
railroads
the
individual
service
was
possibly
less
definitely
classified
and
qualified
than
must
prevail
under
the
exactions
of
modern
conditions
in
keeping
with
the
progress
in
mechanical
and
safety
devices
and
the
necessity
of
a
better
system
we
have
today
a
preliminary
examination
both
physical
and
as
to
fitness
employes
must
pass
examinations
as
to
vision
color
sense
and
hearing
and
their
knowledge
of
the
fundamental
rules
and
regulations
as
well
as
the
fundamental
knowledge
of
road
appliances
and
equipment
these
examinations
are
repeated
from
time
to
time
as
the
class
of
service
and
further
advancement
of
the
employes
may
require
many
of
the
large
railroads
have
established
schools
with
capable
instructors
where
employes
may
receive
instruction
upon
the
performance
of
their
duties
as
well
as
affording
them
an
opportunity
to
fit
themselves
for
promotion
beginning
with
the
general
time
convention
some
thirty
years
ago
the
need
to
standardize
railroad
practices
and
systematically
qualify
employes
began
to
be
realized
the
convention
largely
through
the
efforts
of
allen
saw
that
as
time
is
the
term
in
which
railroad
schedules
are
expressed
it
was
a
fundamental
necessity
that
there
should
be
standard
time
and
that
the
timepieces
of
employes
which
should
govern
their
observance
of
instructions
and
schedules
must
conform
to
the
standard
this
led
to
the
present
system
of
standard
time
to
the
system
whereby
employes
must
compare
watches
with
standard
clocks
must
have
watches
inspected
regularly
and
record
taken
of
same
must
compare
watches
and
register
before
trips
the
general
time
convention
led
to
the
formation
of
the
american
railway
association
consisting
of
the
executive
and
operating
officers
of
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
and
canada
the
association
considers
problems
of
railroad
operation
construction
and
equipment
and
recommends
practices
for
their
solution
their
investigations
conclusions
and
recommended
practices
embrace

physical
and

marked
progress
has
been
made
in
the
work
of
the
various
organizations
of
railroad
officers
with
the
work
of
the
association
to
secure
the
benefit
of
the
broadest
and
most
careful
consideration
of
the
subjects
assurance
therefore
exists
that
the
experience
and
knowledge
of
railway
management
and
officers
will
be
brought
from
time
to
time
into
the
text
and
fact
of
standard
practices
promoting
convenience
by
close
interline
relationships
and
uniformity
of
regulation
and
causing
a
uniform
systematic
and
careful
regard
for
safety
by
way
of
recapitulation
so
to
recapitulate
from
a
few
miles
of
crude
tramways
the
world
has
in
a
century
built
miles
of
steam
operated
and
miles
of
electrically
operated
roads
instead
of
spragging
the
wheels
we
rely
on
the
automatic
brake
the
coupling
of
cars
has
become
an
imitation
of
the
action
of
human
hands
instead
of
risking
their
destruction
each
train
finds
the
condition
of
road
ahead
and
protects
itself
by
the
agency
of
electric
circuits
and
semaphores
the
sequence
of
whose
operation
discloses
on
behalf
of
safety
any
obstruction
of
the
route
barrows
are
replaced
by
steel
cars
larger
than
the
miner
cabin
and
carrying
more
than
his
month
output
instead
of
traveling
on
a
tramway
stage
coach
the
passenger
finds
available
for
his
comfort
a
modern

every
luxury
known

by
the
bar
of
steel
weighing

to
the

whose
manufacture

and
maintenance
is
prescribed
with
every
degree
of
refinement
known
to
the
chemist
and
engineer
we
have
learned
to
treat
drainage
and
ballast
as
an
architectural
science
and
our
bridges
from
the
span
now
make
continuous
roadbed
for
operation
even
over
the
continental
rivers
some
one
has
said
that
the
builders
art
consisted
in
making
the
structure
proclaim
the
purpose
for
which
designed
and
to
my
mind
there
is
nothing
which
quite
so
dramatically
fulfils
this
as
the
modern
steam
locomotive
how
many
of
you
have
seen
a
huge
pacific
locomotive
drawing
a
train
of
tons
at
a
speed
of
miles
an
hour
yet
under
control
of
one
man
just
the
same
as
rocket
which
could
have
been
lifted
off
its
track
and
set
on
the
ground
by
four
strong
men
and
which
was
a
when
for
a
short
distance
it
attained
a
speed
of
twenty
miles
an
hour
we
know
that
our
engineman
with
a
pacific
locomotive
and
the
train
can
stop
his
train
with
the
air
brake
in
a
definite
distance
these
comparisons
briefly
as
might
be
between
we
will
say
the
beginnings
of
the
nineteenth
and
of
the
twentieth
centuries
show
how
the
commercial
growth
and
increase
of
trade
have
produced
a
demand
for
transportation
to
be
performed
and
with
the
performance
an
economic
revolution
we
have
in
a
general
way
though
with
far
less
than
the
thoroughness
of
which
the
subject
is
worthy
outlined
what
might
be
called
the
state
of
the
art
of
railroad
plant
and
operation
in
a
relative
sense
progress
of
a
pronounced
character
has
occurred
that
this
progress
has
been
accomplished
by
increased
safety
is
demonstrated
by
common
knowledge
and
confirmed
by
the
records
both
of
the
railroads
and
the
public
authorities
as
an
illustration
take
the
statistics
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
increased
safety
of
railroad
operation
is
indicated
in
part
by
the
following
figures
for
the
decade
following
the
beginning
of
the
records
namely
to
the
fatalities
were
in
for
the
next
decade
bringing
it
down
to
the
present
time
the
fatalities
were
in
the
gain
in
ratio
being
for
the
nation
at
large
fully
per
cent
looking
at
the
conditions
in
the
state
of
new
york
where
the
density
of
travel
is
considerably
in
excess
of
that
of
the
country
as
a
whole
we
find
a
report
of
the
state
engineer
in
the
year
showing
ratio
of
fatalities
of
in
the
average
for
six
years
to
inclusive
shows
in
an
increase
in
relative
safety
of
per
cent
we
may
assume
that
never
before
in
the
history
of
railroad
transportation
was
there
presented
a
bigger
problem
than
the
weights
are
greater
the
distances
are
greater
the
speed
is
greater
the
population
is
more
dense
prices
and
wages
are
higher
and
the
public
service
more
exacting
a
gathering
of
the
official
representatives
of
the
nation
and
of
every
state
possibly
with
a
desire
for
uniform
and
concerted
action
even
though
it
may
be
unofficial
points
with
emphasis
to
the
attitude
from
which
the
public
contemplates
the
employment
of
the
railways
in
their
behalf
it
is
i
believe
an
accepted
fact
of
our
political
constitution
at
the
present
time
that
the
public
through
its
authorized
representatives
and
through
lawful
channels
has
a
right
to
be
reasonably
assured
in
this
respect
i
believe
that
the
manifested
as
well
as
the
inquiries
by
the
various
railway
boards
has
in
a
great
sense
aided
in
reaching
our
present
standard
of
excellence
to
which
we
can
point
with
pride
in
comparison
with
any
other
national
railway
system
of
the
globe
we
are
becoming
more
familiar
the
railroad
management
and
employes
with
the
standpoint
of
the
public
and
the
public
is
becoming
more
familiar
with
the
problems
of
the
railroads
the
mutual
aim
is
first
safety
and
service
and
second
economy
the
public
concern
for
the
safety
and
service
is
for
its
own
protection
and
the
railroad
management
must
give
both
with
economy
so
far
we
have
been
dealing
largely
with
the
progressive
safety
of
railroad
operation
as
furthered
by
the
action
of
the
railways
either
initiatively
or
responsively
as
the
case
might
be
we
have
described
the
improvement
in
roadway
equipment
and
appliances
the
standardizing
of
regulations
for
operation
the
selection
of
employees
and
their
government
with
the
better
understanding
of
the
problem
of
the
railroad
by
the
public
through
and
in
connection
with
the
special
boards
represented
here
today
it
might
not
be
amiss
to
express
the
hope
that
such
needs
as
can
not
be
met
without
the
active
support
of
public
opinion
and
perhaps
legislation
will
be
clearly
brought
out
one
of
the
thoughts
that
occurs
to
me
was
suggested
by
a
recent
exhibit
from
the
records
of
the
loss
of
life
damage
to
railroad
property
as
well
as
injury
to
persons
and
property
conveyed
due
to
the
presence
of
unauthorized
persons
upon
railroad
property
whether
wilfully
or
carelessly
trespassing
as
an
illustration
of
its
seriousness
during
last
year
over
trespassers
lost
their
lives
on
railroads
besides
a
large
number
injured
numerous
mishaps
have
been
traced
to
acts
of
trespassers
which
may
be
the
secret
of
many
unexplained
casualties
the
railroads
are
a
highway
for
the
migration
of
tramps
and
unemployed
persons
who
commit
petty
depredations
jeopardize
the
safety
of
trains
and
the
lives
of
employees
and
passengers
it
seems
of
no
avail
that
thousands
of
the
worst
class
are
arrested
by
railroad
police
forces
and
convictions
secured
as
the
sentences
in
the
majority
of
cases
serve
rather
to
aggravate
than
to
mitigate
the
evil
one
line
arrested
over
trespassers
during
the
past
year
and
secured
convictions
in
per
cent
of
the
cases
but
in
half
of
them
sentence
was
suspended
which
usually
meant
that
the
offender
used
the
railroad
to
escape
from
the
scene
i
do
not
wish
to
be
understood
to
asperse
the
administration
of
justice
nor
to
insist
that
offences
of
a
serious
character
are
always
committed
by
railroad
trespassers
but
the
hazard
involved
is
one
that
should
not
be
permitted
to
exist
the
railroad
property
destroyed
or
damaged
bearing
no
relation
to
the
risk
of
persons
and
property
transported
and
to
the
enormous
loss
of
life
involved
i
feel
that
the
attention
of
those
accustomed
to
broadly
viewing
problems
of
public
concern
should
be
brought
to
bear
upon
these
facts
with
the
hope
that
measures
may
be
taken
to
insure
greater
safety
in
this
respect
as
well
as
to
save
the
waste
of
life
and
property
now
resulting
from
or
incident
to
the
practice
i
might
venture
to
suggest
that
the
loss
of
life
is
far
greater
than
entailed
through
decades
by
boiler
explosions
or
collisions
the
seriousness
of
which
i
do
not
wish
to
deprecate
and
the
situation
might
warrant
special
record
of
the
facts
being
obtained
in
behalf
of
the
public
through
the
regular
channels
wherein
lies
the
increased
safety
of
the
future
may
perhaps
be
the
query
in
many
minds
it
is
universally
sought
it
would
be
mere
conjecture
on
my
part
and
with
your
indulgence
i
am
not
inclined
to
prophesy
as
i
see
it
the
great
problem
is
to
make
our
progress
sure
taking
no
doubtful
measures
adopting
no
specious
devices
which
may
appeal
to
us
at
first
blush
until
we
have
satisfied
ourselves
that
no
greater
risk
is
involved
by
the
change
the
multiplication
of
rules
enjoining
obedience
together
with
devices
for
additional
protection
may
yield
a
false
sense
of
security
if
fundamental
obedience
to
existing
rules
and
efficiency
of
existing
appliances
is
one
bit
impaired
by
the
addition
we
must
not
embrace
paper
reforms
even
though
clamor
and
pressure
be
great
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
better
than
a
pound
of
cure
we
grant
but
reverse
the
proverb
and
the
pound
of
prevention
may
us
the
public
official
would
seem
to
be
in
a
judicial
position
mindful
of
public
justice
and
safety
basing
his
judgment
and
acts
upon
facts
alone
improvement
in
general
safety
and
character
of
railroad
operation
must
be
the
product
not
only
of
an
enlightened
public
opinion
and
the
conservative
wisdom
of
public
representatives
but
progressive
and
careful
management
coupled
with
a
sense
of
discipline
and
responsibility
and
industry
of
railroad
employees
who
must
jointly
share
the
obligations
of
the
problem
speaking
of
the
compliance
we
have
cheerfully
made
to
the
suggestions
of
the
public
representatives
the
commissions
in
regard
to
improvements
of
service
facilities
and
conditions
of
operation
we
believe
in
the
long
run
that
these
things
mean
a
better
standard
and
greater
security
for
railroad
property
as
well
as
the
enormous
benefit
that
accrues
to
the
public
by
reason
of
proper
and
efficient
railway
service
and
we
have
only
thoughts
of
admiration
for
the
attitudes
of
the
commissions
as
we
have
found
them
they
have
a
large
problem
we
are
glad
to
avail
ourselves
of
their
wisdom
and
believe
it
to
be
the
means
whereby
the
responsibility
of
the
carriers
to
the
public
is
secured
and
through
whom
the
responsibility
of
the
public
to
the
railroads
must
be
voiced
gentlemen
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
attention
and
the
favor
which
i
acknowledge
of
being
permitted
to
address
you
as
best
i
may
upon
a
subject
to
which
we
are
all
devoted
in
the
absence
of
a
distinct
literature
on
the
subject
that
your
worthy
president
assigned
to
me
my
efforts
are
perhaps
a
bit
crudely
devised
having
no
pattern
in
another
generation
we
may
perhaps
evolve
a
distinct
species
of
railroad
statesman
and
an
encyclopedia
from
which
we
will
be
able
to
point
back
to
the
beginnings
and
the
efforts
at
mutual
advice
and
to
the
growth
and
knowledge
that
have
ensued
just
as
we
have
seen
the
day
of
small
things
in
railroads
to
be
the
beginning
of
a
constant
growth
to
the
wonders
of
today
i
am
sure
that
the
american
people
can
congratulate
themselves
upon
an
institution
of
the

of
your

of
your

honorable

consequently
the
cost
of
handling
the
mail
as
hereafter
shown
have
been
largely
increased
through
higher
prices
for
both
material
and
labor
so
that
if
the
railways
were
not
ten
years
ago
the
present
rates
being
lower
than
those
paid
at
that
time
would
be
too
low
and
should
really
be
increased
to
give
the
railroads
a
reasonable
return
far
from
doing
this
legislation
enacted
in
the
past
few
years
has
had
the
effect
of
cutting
down
the
mail
pay
of
the
railroads
whilst
the
special
requirements
as
to
service
and
equipment
have
been
made
more
severe
and
exacting
recent
acts
of
congress
or
orders
of
the
postoffice

which
have
the
force
of

that
have

pay
on
all

empty

and
certain

may
be
conservatively
estimated
that
the
annual
loss
in
mail
revenue
to
the
railroads
by
withdrawing
these
shipments
from
the
mails
is
at
least
with
practically
no

of
this
change

that
always
previously
used
and
theretofore
regarded
as
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
law
the
effect
of
this
on
the

weighings

to
reduce
railway

and
changing
certain

the
effect
of
all
of
these
reductions
on
the
mail
revenue
of
the
railroads
aggregate
per
annum
or
per
cent
of
the
total
pay
received
by
them
in
the
year
ending
june
for
handling
the
mail
and
furnishing
railway
postal
cars
these
reductions
were
made
without
justification
and
for
the
purpose
of
reducing
railroad
revenues
and
incidentally
the
expenses
of
the
postoffice
department
at
a
time
when
the
net
earnings
of
the
carriers
seemed
large
to
the
public
mind
although
under
these
favorable
conditions
the
returns
to
the
shareholders
approximated
but
per
whilst
farmers
were
receiving
per
manufacturers
per
cent
and
national
banks
to
per
cent
it
is
true
that
there
has
been
a
large
increase
in
the
gross
revenue
of
the
railroads
in
the
last
ten
years
but
this
has
accrued
from
traffic
other
than
carriage
of
the
mails
and
has
been
accompanied
by
great
increase
in
operating
expenses
in
fact
were
it
not
for
the
economies
of
the
carriers
effected
by
the
use
of
more
powerful
locomotives
and
larger
freight
cars
the
increase
in
operating
expenses
would
without
doubt
have
fully
neutralized
the
growth
in
revenue
in
the
months
preceding
the
panic
of
october
the
railroads
were
quite
generally
showing
decreases
in
net
earnings
in
face
of
the
largest
gross
earnings
in
their
history
it
was
costing
them
much
more
than
a
dollar
to
handle
every
dollar
increase
in
gross
earnings
since
the
hasty
enactment
of
legislation
reducing
mail
pay
the
revenues
of
the
roads
have
been
seriously
affected
by
a
change
in
business
conditions
which
has
reduced
traffic
without
reducing
prices
of
materials
and
labor
at
the
same
time
legislation
has
increased
labor
costs
by
reducing
hours
of
service
in
rates
for
transporting
the
mails
were
too
low
to
cover
the
cost
of
service
they
are
much
too
low
now
and

losses
on
the

conditions
commencing
in

part

an
index
of
the
latter
the
commercial
and
financial
chronicle
of
september
showed
that
roads
aggregating
miles
or
per
cent
of
all
roads
in
the
country
had
suffered
a
loss
of
or
per
in
net
earnings
in
the
first
half
of
the
calendar
year
as
compared
with
same
period
of
previous
year
the
foregoing
statement
clearly
shows
the
difference
between
the
revenue
obtained
from
passenger
trains
as
compared
with
freight
trains
the
control
of
the
former
is
largely
out
of
the
hands
of
railroad
operating
officers
as
to
meet
competitive
and
traffic
conditions
heavier
and
more
luxurious
passenger
cars
must
constantly
be
furnished
which
of
course
means
largely
increased
expense
with
very
little
increase
in
the
paying
train
load
in
fact
as
to
the
mails
notwithstanding
an
increase
in
tonnage
carried
on
the
average
train
the
mail
earnings
per
passenger
train
mile
were
actually
less
in
than
in
due
largely
to
the
automatic
reduction
of
railway
mail
pay
per
ton
mile
considering
the
freight
train
mile
the
composition
of
which
is
almost
entirely
within
the
control
of
the
railroads
which
institute
methods
for
reducing
cost
of
transportation
it
will
be
observed
that
by
such
methods
the
railroads
have
been
enabled
to
place
per
cent
more
tonnage
in
a
train
bring
them
per
cent
more
earnings
which
can
be
applied
as
an
offset
to
the
increase
of
per
cent
in
the
cost
of
running
a
train
one
mile
this
increase
in
operating
expenses
per
train
mile
last
referred
to
has
been
brought
about
largely
because
of
the
increased
cost
of
labor
and
materials
which
as
is
well
known
has
been
general
throughout
the
country
comparing
results
of
operation
of
all
railroads
of
the
united
states
for
the
year
ending
june
with
when
this
question
was
last
up
it
is
shown
by
reports
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
gross
revenue
from
operations
as
well
as
income
from
investments
increased
this
is
a
very
large
sum
but
let
us
see
what
becomes
of
it
increased
wages
paid
to
employes
consumed
or
per
purchase
of
material
included
in
operating
expenses
or
per
cent
of
the
increased
income
and
these
material
purchases
represented
largely
labor
involved
in
their
production
increases
in
betterments
and
miscellaneous
deductions
consumed
or
per
cent
of
the
increased
income
larger
payments
for
interest
on
funded
debt
and
current
liabilities
consumed
or
per
and
larger
taxes
per
leaving
or
per
cent
of
the
increased
income
for
the
owners
of
the
properties
the
stockholders
in
dividends
were
less
than
per
cent
of
the
capital
stock
and
in
even
with
the
large
increase
noted
they
were
only
per
cent
contrast
this
with
the
manufacturers
returns
of
per
the
farmers
of
per
and
the
national
banks
of
to
per
cent
on
their
capitalization
reduction
in
railway
mail
pay
was
not
justified
in
it
was
far
less
justified
in
on
the
contrary
there
has
been
a
large
fall
in
mail
pay
per
ton
mile
and
conditions
under
which
mails
are
transported
are
becoming
more
and
more
onerous
the
cost
of
building
a
railway
postoffice
car
to
the
present
plans
and
specifications
of
the
postoffice
department
is
at
least
per
cent
more
than
it
was
in
although
pay
received
for
handling
these
cars
that
weigh
from
to
per
cent
more
than
formerly
has
been
arbitrarily
cut
over
per
cent
by
the
act
of
congress
of
and
has
since
been
further
cut
through
readjustment
of
routes
for
the
year
ending
june
the
railroads
received
gross
including
railway
postoffice
pay
for
carrying
per
cent
greater
tonnage
of
mails
than
in
a
sum
less
than
it
would
have
been
but
for
the
reduction
of
rate
from
cents
in
to
cents
in
in
face
of
this
as
we
have
shown
arbitrary
cuts
of
more
have
been
made
a
grand
total
of
over
less
paid
now
than
ten
years
ago
about
eighteen
months
ago
the
conclusion
was
reached
that
heavier
and
stronger
cars
were
demanded
by
changed
conditions
resulting
in
heavier
trains
greater
speed
and
increased
frequency
and
consequent
risk
of
accident
to
clerks
and
mail
in
collisions
and
wrecks
after
careful
investigation
and
expert
testimony
the
specifications
were
revised
so
that
full
cars
would
weigh
about
pounds
instead
of
pounds
and
be
greatly
strengthened
by
the
free
use
of
steel
plates
and
oak
timbers
to
meet
the
views
of
car
builders
east
and
west
two
plans
and
specifications
slightly
differing
were
adopted
as
standard
and
railroads
were
given
the
option
of
conforming
to
one
or
the
other
the
best
known
features
were
adopted
in
both
plans
producing
in
the
judgment
of
responsible
car
builders
a
car
of
exceptional
resisting
and
carrying
power
when
new
lines
of
cars
are
authorized
by
the
department
or
new
cars
are
ordered
to
take
the
place
of
old
cars
in
service
companies
operating
the
routes
are
furnished
copies
of
these
specifications
and
the
superintendent
of
division
is
instructed
to
see
that
cars
are
built
in
conformity
therewith
inspections
are
made
while
the
car
is
in
the
shop
and
when
it
is
completed
a
full
report
is
made
and
forwarded
to
the
department
a
decision
is
then
reached
as
to
whether
the
car
is
satisfactory
and
can
be
accepted
annual
report
for
this
increase
in
weight
of
a
postal
car
might
not
be
thought
of
much
moment
but
it
means
to
the
railroads
the
movement
of
additional
gross
ton
miles
per
car
per
year
costing
them
per
annum
in
operating
expenses
whilst
as
shown
they
receive
per
cent
less
railway
postoffice
pay
now
than
formerly
united
states
postal
laws
and
regulations
section
provide
that
the
average
weight
of
the
mails
used
in
fixing
rates
shall
be
established
by
the
actual
weighing
of
the
mails
for
a
period
of
not
less
than
thirty
days
and
less
than
one
in
every
four
years
the
construction
placed
upon
this
by
the
department
has
been
the
one
which
reduced
to
the
minimum
the
pay
which
the
railroads
receive
for
services
rendered
if
mail
traffic
were
stationary
weighing
every
four
years
would
not
matter
much
but
the
increase
of
mail
matter
throughout
the
united
states
has
been
very
great
and
because
of
the
policy
of
the
department
to
weigh
the
mails
not
more
frequently
than
every
four
years
heavy
losses
have
resulted
through
the
railroads
having
to
haul
tonnage
for
three
successive
years
following
each
weighing
for
which
they
receive
no
pay
as
a
result
of
this
policy
of
quadrennial
weighings
the
roads
in
interstate
commerce
groups
and
including
the
territory
west
of
the
missouri
river
and
the
mississippi
below
louis
between
and
suffered
a
loss
of
or
per
cent
of
the
aggregate
railway
mail
pay
compared
with
what
they
should
have
received
if
the
mails
had
been
weighed
annually
in
other
words
this
loss
is
equivalent
to
a
reduction
in
the
rate
received
per
ton
mile
in
these
groups
of
states
of
per
cent
the
loss
to
roads
in
the
western
part
of
the
united
states
is
most
striking
due
as
it
is
to
the
rapid
growth
of
that
section
the
same
reduction
though
to
a
slightly
less
degree
obtains
in
other
parts
of
the
united
states
comparative
returns
to
the
railroads
from
conducting
mail
passenger
and
freight
service
in
the
united
states
in
order
to
make
a
fair
comparison
of
operating
results
from
different
classes
of
traffic
it
is
necessary
to
consider
them
under
substantially
similar
conditions
the
best
measure
of
railroad
service
is
work
done
or
weight
multiplied
by
distance
carried
in
other
words
the
ton
mileage
a
comparison
of
services
differing
so
widely
as
the
mail
passenger
and
freight
on
the
basis
of
ton
mileage
of
such
business
is
however
unfair
because
in
the
two
former
an
excessive
proportion
of
dead
weight
must
be
transported
for
each
ton
of
paying
load
whilst
with
freight
traffic
the
proportion
of
dead
weight
is
small
the
hauling
power
of
a
locomotive
is
measured
not
by
revenue
ton
miles
but
by
ton
miles
of
gross
weight
it
making
little
difference
to
the
locomotive
as
to
what
this
gross
ton
mileage
is
composed
of
the
gross
tonnage
and
the
speed
at
which
it
must
be
moved
being
the
factors
that
consume
the
energy
of
the
locomotive
a
computation
has
been
made
of
ton
mileage
on
each
individual
mail
route
by
multiplying
weight
carried
by
length
of
route
to
the
sum
of
these
we
add
the
dead
weight
of
cars
the
report
of
the
second
assistant
for
year
ending
june
page
gives
the
number
of
cars
engaged
in
mail
service
which
we
have
multiplied
by
the
average
mileage
made
by
the
average
car
based
on
experience
of
the
union
pacific
and
southern
pacific
systems
to
ascertain
total
car
mileage
for
the
united
states
multiplying
this
by
the
dead
weight
of
a
car
gives
the
ton
mileage
of
dead
weight
which
added
to
the
ton
mileage
of
mails
gives
the
gross

mileage
measure
of
work
and
cost
imposed
on
the
railroads
in
return
for
the
pay
they
receive
for
handling
the
mails
these
computations
are
shown
in
the
following
statements
the
results
being
conservative
as
for
want
of
accurate
data
it
has
been
necessary
to
omit
some
work
which
the
railroads
do
which
if
ascertainable
would
increase
the
cost
for
example
we
have
made
no
charge
for
the
dead
weight
of
that
portion
of

relative

to
determine
the

to
the
railroads
of
performing

passenger

we
must
allocate
the
expenses
to
freight
and
passenger
service
as
a
whole
afterwards
apportioning
the
latter
to
mails
and
other
service
railroad
operating
expenses
apply
jointly
to

so
that
with
few
exceptions
it
is
impossible
to
determine
exactly
from
any
published
statistics
the
cost
of
passenger
train
service
as
distinguished
from
freight
there
are
some
items
of
train

expense
directly
connected
with

which
are
less
for
passenger
than
for
freight
trains
whilst
on
the
other
hand
many
other
expenses
are
greater
for
passenger
than
for

such
as
danger
from
casualties
necessity
of
expensive

delays
to

through
preference
given

additional

tracks
and
particularly
higher
standards
of
maintenance
of
roadbed
required
for
high
speed
passenger
train
movement
on
account
of
the
impossibility
of
separating
the
expenses
we
assume
that
the
above
factors
about
balance
each
other
and
that
the
average
cost
of
running
trains
can
be
taken
as
either
passenger
or
freight
train
mile
cost
respectively
without
serious
error
we
allocate
a
proportion
of
the
passenger

cost
to
the
mails
on
the

of
the

the

is

the
mail
earnings
are
hardly
what
they
should
be
to
pay
a
fair
share
of
the
railroad
operating
expenses
only
regardless
of
taxes
and
interest
or
put
in
another
way
our
computations
have
shown
that
in
each
passenger
train
run
the
railroads
haul
an
average
of
of
a
mail
car
and
the
contents
of
this
car
yielded
average
earnings
of
cents
for
each
mile
run
the
computation
just
made
shows
that
each
freight
car
run
loaded
or
empty
yields
a
revenue
to
the
carrier
of
cents
per
mile
incredible
as
this
may
seem
it
is
understandable
when
we
reflect
that
the
railroads
transport
tons
of
dead
weight
for
each
ton
of
freight
for
which
they
are
paid
with
mail
they
transport
tons
or
twenty
times
as
much
the
freight
rate
is
per
ton
mile
the
mail
rate
or
only
thirteen
times
as
much
arguing
in
still
another
way
average
number
of
cars
in
each
passenger
train
handled
in
united
states
is
of
which
mail
cars
amount
to
or
per
cent
eleven
per
cent
of
the
average
earnings
of
a
passenger
train
is
cents
but
mail
contributed
only
cents
that
is
it
should
pay
per
cent
more
than
it
does
to
be
made
to
contribute
a
fair
share
to
the
insufficient
earnings
of
a
passenger
train
mails
are
fairly
responsible
on
basis
of
space
used
for
per
cent
of
the
cost
of
running
a
passenger
train
or
cents
and
as
dead
weight
per
foot
of
space
is
greater
with
mails
their
proportion
of
train
mile
cost
is
even
larger
they
pay
little
more
than
this
cost
by
building
larger
capacity
cars
and
larger
engines
the
cost
of
handling
freight
traffic
entirely
in
the
control
of
the
carrier
has
been
reduced
to
follow
rate
reductions
and
increased
expenses
on
the
other
hand
because
methods
of
conducting
passenger
traffic
are
largely
and
mail
traffic
entirely
beyond
their
control
the
cost
of
handling
mail
and
passengers
has
been
steadily
increasing
and
as
revenue
has
not
increased
the
net
revenue
or
margin
of
profit
has
been
cut
to
a
point
where
it
is
unremunerative
the
argument
advanced
by
advocates
of
reduced
mail
pay
that
increasing
density
permitted
economies
and
that
lower
rates
would
yield
more
net
is
not
applicable
when
the
carriers
hands
are
tied
and
measures
of
economy
so
successfully
applied
to
handling
freight
are
prohibited
the
following
will
illustrate
this
on
routes
where
pouch
service
is
used
mail
is
handled
with
express
and
baggage
without
much
increase
of
cost
over
other
passenger
traffic
a
somewhat
greater
mail
traffic
obliges
the
railroads
to
furnish
apartment
cars
at
increased
expense
and
dead
weight
for
the
postoffice
feature
but
still
permitting
the
railroads
to
carry
other
traffic
in
the
same
car
a
still
further
increase
in
weight
means
the
establishment
of
full
lines
for
which
the
railroads
receive
extra
but
inadequate
compensation
these
cars
being
used
for
no
other
class
of
traffic
and
adding
largely
to
the
weight
and
cost
of
train
service
even
after
the
route
has
been
made
an
route
the
railroads
are
not
permitted
to
economize
by
carrying
more
mail
in
the
car
and
as
traffic
density
grows
the
roads
must
under
the
requirements
of
the
department
add
more
cars
almost
in
proportion
to
the
business
as
the
loads
carried
in
cars
as
shown
by
recent
special
weighing
average
only
tons
and
many
of
them
return
empty
for
which
empty
haul
the
railroads
often
receive
no
pay
when
the
mail
business
has
assumed
very
large
proportions
and
the
cars
have
multiplied
in
ratio
therewith
special
trains
are
then
added
to
carry
the
bulk
of
the
mail
being
run
at
very
high
speed
and
adding
to
the
railroad
expense
account
in
a
far
higher
degree
per
unit
of
business
than
any
other
class
of
traffic
in
contrast
to
the
above
baggage
and
express
are
very
generally
hauled
in
the
same
and
a
much
lighter
and
less
costly
car
than
the
mail
car
and
increase
in
tonnage
is
accommodated
by
hauling
greater
loads
per
car
in
the
case
of
freight
increased
density
means
larger
car
and
train
loads
and
greatly
reduced
costs
of
operating
per
ton
mile
despite
these
differences
in
conditions
the
automatic
scale
has
secured
to
the
government
a
larger
reduction
in
mail
rates
per
ton
mile
in
the
last
ten
years
than
the
percentage
of
fall
in
freight
rates
despite
higher
labor
and
material
costs
of
railroad
operating
as
a
result
the
mail
business
which
according
to
evidence
introduced
before
the
congressional
committee
of
was
unprofitable
at
that
time
has
been
made
more
unprofitable
at
the
present
time
by
the
heavy
rate
reductions
of
as
the
greatest
reduction
made
deals
with
mail
routes
on
which
traffic
is
heaviest
a
consideration
should
be
given
to
the
following
conditions
of
handling
mail
on
such
routes
heavy
traffic
mail
routes
on
very
many
of
the
heavy
traffic
routes
where
the
principal
reduction
in
pay
occurred
a
large
part
of
the
mail
is
now
handled
in
special
mail
trains
run
at
excessively
high
rates
of
speed
such
trains
introduce
the
following
conditions
a
very
much
greater
liability
to
accident
a
large
proportion
of
the
deplorable
accidents
that
have
occurred
on
the
american
railroads
in
recent
years
have
occurred
to
excessively
high
speed
trains
accidents
to
such
trains
being
almost
invariably
destructive
to
life
and
property
an
examination
of
serious
accidents
on
the
union
pacific
system
and
southern
pacific
company
for
the
calendar
year
shows
that
per
cent
of
the
property
damage
from
all
causes
including
negligence
as
traceable
to
trains
not
under
control
and
excessive
speed
whilst
per
cent
additional
damage
was
due
to
causes
that
might
prevent
inferior
trains
getting
out
of
their
way
such
as
keeping
main
line
on
time
of
superior
trains
failure
to
observe
signals
or
orders
etc
mail
trains
run
at
excessive
high
speed
are
much
more
expensive
to
operate
than
other
trains
for
the
following
reasons
fuel
consumption
per
traffic
unit
is
very
much
greater
at
high
speed
because
of
diminished
tractive
power
of
locomotives
a
relative
greater
hauling
capacity
of
locomotives
must
be
consumed
in
moving
trains
at
higher
speeds
excessive
speed
requires
higher
standards
of
track
maintenance
block
signals
heavy
rail
better
ballasted
roadbed
etc
high
speed
means
increased
wear
and
tear
on
equipment
and
track
high

trains
are
expensive
delaying
and
adding
to
the
cost
of
other

speed
of
trains

mails
has
been
constantly
increased
a
study
made
of
the
speed
per
hour
made
on

on
which
cars
are
handled

the

whilst

have
largely
increased
to
provide
for
the

and
because
of
increase
in
prices
of
labor
and
materials
of
all
kinds
in
the
past
five
or
six
years
this
increase
in

has
been
made
coincident
with
growth
of
freight

which
is
the

business
high

ones

the

is
as
much
if
not
more
this
is
particularly
the
case
with
high

which
is

in

enormous
proportions
we
now
have
in

on

of
the

to
say
nothing
of
recent

made
in

such
heavy

moving
at

is
extremely
destructive
to
the

requiring

introduction
as
illustrating
the
additions
to

because
of
increased

maintenance
on
account
of

trains
we
have
made
a
study
of
statistics
using
the
interstate

report
of
as
a
basis
of
seven
roads
having
a
large
proportion
of
fast
passenger

and
seven
roads
having
a
moderate

passenger
service
but
with
a
large
proportion
of
freight
service
on
the

named

average

was
and
on

in
the

the
operating
expenses
per

mile
in
the
former
class
were
and
in
the
latter
the
roads
in
the
former
class
on
account
of
large
number
of
excessively
trains
were
obliged
to
their
lines
which
directly
increased
maintenance
expenses
pay
for
railway
postal
cars
the
large
reduction
made
by
act
of
march
in
pay
for
railway
postal
cars
was
made
in
face
of
large
increase
in
the
cost
of
constructing
such
cars
due
to
higher
prices
of
labor
and
material
and
greater
cost
of
meeting
the
more
exacting
specifications
of
the
postoffice
department
changing
to
steel
construction
increases
in
weight
and
generally
heavier
operating
expenses
have
created
an
extremely
large
increase
in
cost
of
moving
these
cars
the
standard
railway
postal
car
of
only
a
few
years
ago
feet

weighed

standard

feet

used
on
the
railroads
with
which
i
am
connected

over

each

per

more
whilst
our
new

cars
of
steel
construction
weigh
pounds
and
cost
over
or
per

more
than
the
car
of
a
few
years
ago
an
argument
sometimes
made
in
favor
of
a
lowering
of
car
pay
is
that
for
apartment
cars
used
in
runs
where
mail
density
does
not
require
a
full
car
no
additional
compensation
is
allowed
but
we
feel
that
a
fair
consideration
of
the
circumstances
under
which
mail
is
handled
as
compared
with
other
traffic
will
justify
the
conclusion
that
this
is
not
an
argument
in
favor
of
reducing
pay
but
rather
for
allowing
the
railroad
additional
compensation
for
the
apartment
cars
as
well
both
services
require
the
furnishing
of
special
features
in
the
way
of
traveling
postoffices
not
required
except
for
the
convenience
of
the
postoffice
department
to
enable
it
to
do
work
while
mail
is
in
transit
such
as
ordinarily
performed
in
office
buildings
the
full
postal
car
is
more
expensive
to
the
roads
as
it
always
means
additional
car
service
whilst
in
some
cases
of
apartment
cars
the
space
not
occupied
by
the
traveling
postoffice
is
adequate
to
take
care
of
baggage
and
express
though
very
frequently
this
service
also
means
additional
car
movement
that
would
not
be
necessary
but
for
the
postoffice
feature
the
saving
to
the
railroads
from
reduction
in
car
mileage
that
would
be
possible
if
it
were
not
obliged
to
furnish
traveling
postoffices
but
could
use
the
space
occupied
by
racks
and
other
postoffice
features
by
loading
additional
mail
in

would
be
many
times
the
revenue
allowed
by
the

a
large
amount
of

is
required
annually
by
the
postoffice
department
for

and

officers
of
the
department
the
postoffice
department
issues
annually
about
six
hundred
traveling
commissions
to
postoffice
inspectors
and
other
postal
officials
and
requires
railroad
companies
to
honor
such
commissions
for
free

on
all

on
all
lines
on
which

are
carried
in

are
issued
to

officials
whose
official
duties
are
in
no

connected
with
the

of

the
railroads
have
no
control
whatever
over
the
issuance
of

and
can
not
even
secure
from
the

a

of

these

of

in

postal
deficit
in
investigating
the
subject
of
railway
mail
pay
we
have
been
struck
very
forcibly
with
changes
which
have
taken
place
in
the
revenues
and
expenditures
of
the
postoffice
department
since
when
this
subject
was
last
reviewed
although
postal
operations
still
show
a
deficit
it
is
a
fact
that
its
revenues
have
increased
in
a
remarkable
degree
and
the
deficit
is
certainly
not
due
to
the
amounts
paid
to
the
railroads
for
hauling
mail
as
these
payments
are
relatively
far
less
now
than
formerly
revenues
of
the
postoffice
department
have
grown
from
in
to
over
in
or
per
this
increase
in
revenue
in
eight
years
being
as
great
as
the
entire
increase
in
the
previous
years
but
in
this
same
period
of
eight
years
there
was
an
increase
of
or
per

postoffice

of
which
only
or

was
paid
to
the
railroads
or
per

or

and
their
clerks
and
the
balance
to
other
items

the
railroads
are
themselves
large
contributors
to
the
revenues
of
the
postoffice

it
is
ascertained
that
nine
roads
covering

pay

for

at
the

the

shows
clearly
that
the
ratio
of

to
receipts
of
the
postoffice

would
in
have
been
but
per
cent
and
no
deficit
but
for
the
expenditures
made
for

amount
paid
the

being
now
only

attention
has
been
concentrated
on
this

of
the
postal
expenditure
which
we
contend
is
at
least
not
an
unfair
compensation
to
the
railroads
for
services
rendered
though
the
proportion
of
the
total
revenue
going
to
the
railroads
has
fallen
in
ten
years
the
deficit
still
remains
and
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
any
reduction
in
railway
mail
pay
would
not
be
speedily
absorbed
in
other
directions
on
the
contrary
ought
not
efforts
be
concentrated
to
bring
within
reasonable
figures
the
other
expenses
of
the
department
which
now
absorb
per
cent
of
its
revenue
as
compared
with
only
per
cent
in
despite
an
actual
growth
in
postal
revenue
in
the
same
time
of
or
per
it
will
be
noted
from
these
figures
that
a
reduction
of
per
cent
in
the
ratio
of
railway
mail
pay
to
total
revenue
can
be
entirely
wiped
out
by
an
increase
of
only
per
cent
in
other
postal
expenses
whilst
a
retrenchment
of
per
cent
in
the
latter
would
have
put
the
department
almost
on
a
paying
basis
notwithstanding
the
heavy
cost
of
rural
free
delivery
from
to
actual
totals
show
that
the
railroads
pay
has
increased
per
cent
for
handling
per
cent
more
mail
tonnage
whilst
in
the
same
period
other
expenses
of
the
postoffice
department
have
grown
per
revenues
increasing
per
cent
increased
mail
business
means
a
direct
increase
in
postal
revenue
as
postage
remains
the
same
regardless
of
tonnage
but
carrying
this
increased
business
on
the
part
of
the
railroads
means
less
proportionate
revenue
to
them
according
to
volume
of
tonnage
so
that
the
proportion
of
the
postal
revenue
they
now
receive
is
very
much
less
than
formerly
labor
material
and
the
price
of
everything
sold
in
commerce
have
advanced
materially
as
we
all
know
in
the
past
seven
or
eight
years
railway
mail
pay
being
practically
the
only
thing
that
has
decreased
in
the
face
of
conditions
that
should
have
raised
it
as
a
large
increase
in
mail
tonnage
means
to
the
postoffice
department
about
an
equal
increase
in
revenue
with
a
decreased
payment
per
ton
to
the
railroads
through
lower
rates
the
avoidance
of
a
deficit
would
seem
not
a
difficult
matter
if
other
postal
expenses
were
kept
at
least
within
sufficient
control
so
they
would
not
increase
faster
than
the
increase
in
volume
of
mail
handled
the
postoffice
department
enjoys
this
peculiar
advantage
of
receiving
with
the
growth
of
the
country
an
increase
in
revenue
directly
in
proportion
to
the
increase
in
business
handled
in
disbursing
this
revenue
it
must
pay
less
to
the
railroads
in
proportion
to
the
density
of
business
thus
retaining
to
apply
on
other
expenses
a
larger
net
revenue
year
by
year
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
cost
of
many
branches
of
the
department
should
not
increase
in
the
same
ratio
as
tonnage
of
mail
for
example
that
expenses
of
individual
postoffices
and
administrative
and
general
expenses
should
not
grow
in
this
proportion
yet
regardless
of
these
favorable
influences
expenditures
in
other
directions
have
absorbed
the
great
net
revenues
after
paying
the
railroads
and
it
is
in
these
directions
that
the
cause
of
the
postal
deficit
must
be
looked
for
the
growth
of
these
expenditures
which
since
has
been
much
faster
than
the
rise
in

is
shown
in

to

of

it

included
in

the

show
the

or
a
greater
loss
in

power
which
has
characterized
the
comparisons
previously
shown
evidence
from
official
sources
thus
shows
that
in
purchasing
the
same
quantities
either
of
labor
or
of
supplies
the
railways
have
now
to
expend
much
larger
sums
than
they
did
ten
years
ago
the
official
statistics
already
quoted
are
fully
supported
and
their
pertinence
to
the
problem
in
hand
is
fully
proven
by
the
accounting
records
of
the
purchasing
departments
of
the
several
railways
the
trunk
line
association
has
obtained
detailed
information
concerning
purchases
in
and
by
important

represented
in
its
organization
and
this
information
has
been
carefully
and
accurately
tabulated

largely
increased

of

which
this
tabulation
reveals

an

of
this

and
particularly
of
the
classes
of
labor
and
of
the
articles
shown
to
have
greatly
increased
in
cost
discloses
the
unquestionable
fact
that
the
increased
cost
pervades
the
whole
aggregate
of
operating
expenses
and
that
there
is
no
considerable
exception
to
the
rule
that
every
item
of
operating
expenditure
is
now
very
much
greater
than
it
was
in
other
costs
of
supplying
railway
services
the

of

transportation
which
must
be
borne
out
of

includes
operating
expenses
interest
on

and
taxes
before
discussing
the
increase
in
the
rate
of
interest
demanded
it
is
worth
while
to
note
that
the
exactions
made
by
the
taxing
power
upon
the
railways
have
also
notably
increased
the
sums
annually
paid
as
taxes
on
railway
property
since

thus

from

or
no
less
than
per

closely
akin
to

of
railway

are
the
additional

which
have

be
met
out

on

of
public

the
increased
and
in
many

minute

imposed
by

hepburn
law
of
and
the
rules
and
requirements
established
thereunder
by
the
interstate

commission
and
by
various
state
enactments
have
caused
the
railways
many
new
and
augmented

among
the

which
these

become
necessary
are
those

besides
these

to

there
have
been
considerable

there
have

a
painstaking

to
secure
accurate

concerning

in
these

and

has
been
made
and
data
for
that
purpose
have
been
supplied
by
many
of
the
railways
operating
east
of
the
mississippi
river
these
data
are
necessarily
incomplete
and
fragmentary
the
accounts
of
many
of
the
companies
not
being
kept
in
such
form
as
fully
to
disclose
the
items
desired
in

cases
were
the
data
which
could
be
obtained
for
any
line
complete
some
companies
were
able
to
report
particular
items
while
other
companies
could
not
give
these
but
could
supply
others
generally
speaking
it
should
be
realized
that
the
tabulation
of
these
reports
makes
a
showing
which
is
incomplete
mainly
in
the
form
of
omissions
a
conservative
computation
discloses
that
the
costs
due
to
increases
in
expenses
or
reductions
in
revenue
imposed
by
statutes
or
by
commissions
acting
under
federal
and
state
regulatory
laws
costs
the
railways
of
the
united
states
approximately
in
two
years
that
this
is
not
an
exaggerated
estimate
will
be
appreciated
by
reference
to
the
principal
general
items
of
expenditures
as
enumerated
on
the
preceding
pages
until
these
items
shall
have
been
assigned
a
proper
classification
in
the
accounts
of
the
railroads
the
accurate
results
may
not
be
ascertained
but
it
will
at
once
occur
to
those
in
any
measure
informed
that
there
has
been
an
enormous
increase
of
work
and
expense
placed
upon
the
carriers
to
conform
to
the
innumerable
requirements
of
state
and
federal
laws
and
the
rulings
of
the
commissions
thereunder
and
that
this
burden
has
extended
to
all
departments
of
the
carriers
litigation
and
miscellaneous
expenses
appear
as
a
large
part
of
these
new
costs
and
in
addition
the
carriers
revenues
have
been
greatly
depleted
either
directly
by
the
laws

of

charges
cost
of
obtaining
new
capital
in
the
matter
of
interest
on
the
capital
employed
the
railways
have
apparently
enjoyed
an
advantage
which
would
seem
to
offset
the
natural
tendency
of
interest
rates
to
rise
in
response
to
the
stimulus
of
augmented
cost
in
dollars
and
cents
of
the
commodities
entering
into
the
budget
of
expenditures
of
the
average
recipient
of
interest
that
is
to
say
the
advantage
growing
out
of
the
fact
that
a
large
proportion
of
railway
capital
is
secured
under
contracts
and
that
many
of
the
contracts
now
in
force
unquestionably
run
back
to
a
time
before
the
extensive
depreciation
of
the
american
dollar
began
this
advantage
is
a
real
one
but
its
extent
is
easily
exaggerated
for
the
purpose
of
throwing
light
upon
the
effect
upon
the
cost
of
railway
transportation
of
the
rise
in

which
has
characterized
recent
years

to

been
made
this
sum
represents
indebtedness
now
outstanding
and
includes
some
duplication
owing
to
the
fact
that
certain
of
the
securities
represented
in
the
aggregate
are
themselves
based
upon
other
securities
deposited
as
collateral
or
held
in

secondary

which
could
not
be
eliminated
without
adding
vastly
to
the
difficulty
of
the
inquiry
with
no
corresponding
gain
in
the
accuracy
of
the
result
these
data
are
also
subject
to
the
qualification
necessarily
due
to
the
fact
that
all
of
the
issues
included
were
not
sold
at
par
in
some
cases
a
small
premium
was
doubtless
obtained
and
in
other
cases
a
slight
discount
was
required
but
nevertheless
it
is
believed
that
the
data
fairly
indicate
the
general
change

the

statement
shows
that
the
average
rate
of
interest
demanded
by
those
who
supply
railway
capital
has
greatly
increased
in
and
the
largest
aggregate
of
new

was
incurred
at
the

no

during
the

the
increased
volume
of
loans
at

is
equally
marked
the

this
analysis
clearer

the

and
in
the
first

of
to

the
significance
of
these
figures
is
made
still
more
apparent
by
the
following
table
which
shows
opposite
the

a

only
the

shows
an
increase
in
the
average

rate
demanded
upon
new
loans
to
railway
corporations
from
per
cent
in
to
in
and
in
the
increase
in
the
rate
from
to
was
equal
to
per

and
from
to
it
was
per

in
other
words
one
dollar
would
pay
interest
on
as
much
of
the
new
capital
secured
by
loans
in
as
would
of
the
loans
of
the
gross
revenue
of
obtained
in
both
years
from
the
typical
shipment
of
fourth
class
freight
between
chicago
and
new
york
at
the
unchanged
rate
applicable
to
such
a
shipment
in
both
years
would
pay
interest
on
secured
in
the
earlier
year
and
on
only
secured
in
the
later
year
the
loss
in
power
to
purchase
loaned
capital
therefore
amounts
to
per
cent
in
order
fully
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
this
rise
in
the
cost
of
capital
it
is
necessary
to
realize
that
very
great
sums
of
new
capital
are
annually
required
for
the
necessary
augmentation
and
improvement
of
railway
facilities
this
is
made
evident
by
the
total
yearly
borrowings
as
shown
in
the
foregoing
tables
but
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
further
sums
certainly
not
less
extensive
in
the
aggregate
have
been
raised
through
issues
of
stock
which
promise
no
certain
rate
of
interest
although
these
sums
could
not
have
been
obtained
unless
the
subscribers
had
considered
it
probable
that
they
would
in
the
long
run
receive
returns
in
dividends
at
least
equal
to
the
going
rate
of
interest
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
aggregate
of
new
capital
secured
by
loans
in
each
year
has
very
largely
exceeded
the
total
interest
payments
to
all
capital
obtained
by
borrowing
this
is
shown
by
the
following
table
the
data
in
which
except
those
as
to
the
sums
obtained
by
loans
are
from
the
reports
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
per

total
a
accurate
data
for
payments
to
capital
in
are
not
available
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
purchaser
of
the
services
so
far
the
extent
and
significance
of
the
changes
in
the
value
or
purchasing
power
of
money
have
been
considered
from
the
point
of
view
of
those
who
produce
and
sell
railway
transportation
but
equally
striking
changes
will
appear
and
similar
conclusions
are
inevitable
when
recent
history
is
reviewed
in
the
aspect
which
it
presents
to
those
whose
earnings
are
devoted
in
part
to
the
purchase
of
the
services
which
the
railways
supply
for
the
important
consideration
to
the
who
wishes
to
travel
by
rail
or
who
buys
commodities
that
have
been
so
carried
or
to
the
producer
whose
products
must
go
to
market
over
railway
routes
is
not
how
much
money
must
be
paid
for
the
railway
services
but
rather
how
much
labor
must
be
expended
or
what
quantity
of
his
goods
must
be
produced
in
order
to
obtain
that
sum
of
money
if
the
earnings
of
a
particular
have
increased
from

h
railway

in

at

measured
in

throughout
the
foregoing
discussion
reference
has
frequently
been
made
to
what
has
been
assumed
to
be
a
typical
shipment
that
is
a
carload
of
fourth
class
freight
transported
between
chicago
and
new
york
the
typical
service
rendered
in
moving
this
shipment
would
have
brought
the
railways
gross
receipts
of
in
or
in
any
of
the
intermediate
years
and
would
bring
the
same
amount
now
the
period
in
question
however
has
witnessed
many
thousands
of
changes
in
railway
rates
on
particular
commodities
and
between
particular
points
and
confining
the
discussion
for
the
present
to
the
mere
expression
of
rates
in
terms
of
money
it
is
necessary
to
inquire
whether
the
general
level
of
all
rates
has
been
raised
or
lowered
and
how
far
the
change
if
any
is
discovered
has
gone
in
either
direction
now
it
is
manifestly
impossible
to
correlate
all
rates
in
a
single
tabulation
and
giving
to
each
its
proper
weight
in
the
determination
of
a
final
average
thus
establish
definitely
and
with
complete
precision
the
relation
between
the
money
rates
of
and
those
at
the
present
time
the
number
of
different
articles
shipped
and
the
great
number
of
different
points
at
which
each
article
may
enter
into
the
aggregate
of
traffic
movement
or
to
which
it
may
be
destined
as
well
as
the
elusive
character
of
the
factors
which
would
indicate
the
relative
weight
properly
to
be
allowed
to
each
separate
rate
wholly
preclude
the
adoption
of
such
a
method
fortunately
however
american
railway
accountants
long
ago
adopted
a
measure
of
traffic
movement
which
was
later
officially
sanctioned
by
its
adoption
for
the
same
purpose
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
which
when
compared
with
the
gross
receipts
from
freight
service
results
in
an
average
that
throws
great
light
upon
the
movement
or
absence
of
movement
in
the
general
level
of
the
rates
charged
when
the
weight
of
any
shipment
expressed
in
tons
is
multiplied
by
the
distance
which
it
is
carried
expressed
in
miles
the
resulting
product
gives
a
measure
of
the
service
performed
in
units
which
are
designated
as
when
the
or
of
all
shipments
are
aggregated
the
total

the
sum

revenue

the

the
chief
significance

really
to
indicate
that

far
as

a
fairly
stable
unit
and
thus
an
excellent
measure
of
the
rise
or
fall
in

whether
the

conclusion
is
to
be
derived
from
a
study
of
the

the
proportion
of

it

not
practicable
to
extend

nevertheless
the

convey

character
of
the

during

different

and
the
nature

that

that

the

for

or

the

included
in
the

the

as
expressed

were

or

of

were
reduced
in
instances
or

of

and
remained

or

of
the

of
the

in
cases
in
which
the

had

of
the

applied
to

which

even

being

rates
were
advanced
in
but
instances
out

such
reductions
averaging
per

significance
of
the
depreciation
of
money
it
has
now
been
fully
demonstrated
first
that
the
railways
have
to
pay
much
more
probably
not
less
on
the
average
than
per
cent
more
for
everything
they
require
in
the
conduct
of
their
business
including
labor
than
they
did
ten
years
ago
second
that
those
who
make
use
of
railway
services
receive
much
more
probably
not
less
on
the
average
than
per
cent
more
for
their
labor
or
for
the
commodities
which
they
produce
than
they
did
ten
years
ago
third
that
average
rates
per
ton
per
mile
for
railway
freight
transportation
expressed
in
money
that
is
to
say
in
dollars
and
decimal
fractions
of
dollars
are
now
somewhat
lower
than
they
were
in
or
formerly
and
fourth
that
the
unit
is
a
highly
stable
one
as
to
quality
and
that
in
consequence
of
this
stability
the
rates
accurately
answer
the
question
whether
rates
expressed
in
money
have
remained
stationary
have
advanced
or
have
declined
the
latter
conclusion
has
been
supplemented
and
by
data
from
the
classifications
and
rate
schedules
which
tend
strongly
to
prove
the
same
fact
therefore
it
has
been
made
plainly
apparent
that
there
has
been
a
decline
in
money
rates
since
but
railways
require
money
only
to
remunerate
the
highly
skilled
labor
they
employ
to
purchase
necessary
materials
and
supplies
to
pay
taxes
and
to
compensate
the
capital
they
use
consequently
money
is
worth
to
the
railway
corporation
as
to
the
only
what
it
will
buy
for
the
satisfaction
of
wants
a
dollar
which
will
pay
for
less
labor
or
buy
less
fuel
for
locomotives
is
worth
less
to
the
railway
just
as
a
dollar
that
will
buy
less
bread
or
clothing
is
worth
less
to
the
man
who
works
for
wages
or
receives
it
as
interest
on
his
savings
it
has
long
been
realized
that
any
effort
to
study
the
question
of
wages
throughout
an
extended
period
which
fails
to
take
into
consideration
the
purchasing
power
of
the
money
received
is
worse
than
valueless
because
it
is
deceptive
and
misleading
it
has
been
generally
recognized
also
that
any
effort
to
consider
the
condition
of
particular
classes
of
producers
by
comparisons
of
the
prices
obtained
for
their
products
at
different
periods
as
that
of
farmers
by
the
prices
of
corn
and
wheat
is
similarly
dangerous
unless
these
prices
are
turned
into
quantities
of
the
commodities
which
such
producers
must
purchase
in
elucidating
this
obvious
point
mccain
cites
such
authorities
as
adam
smith
john
stuart
mill
president
hadley
of
yale
professor
frank
taussig
of
harvard
and
then
continues
a
rapid
decrease
in
the
purchasing
power
of
the
money
they
receive
has
brought
about
within
a
single
decade
a
reduction
in
railway
freight
rates
that
can
not
be
less
than
per
cent
this
reduction
began
almost
imperceptibly
at
a
time
when
american
railway
rates
were
already
lower
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
railways
and
lower
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
it
has
proceeded
concurrently
with
the
fall
in
the
real
value
that
is
in
the
purchasing
power
of
the
american
dollar
but
in
such
subtle
form
that
only
when
its
consequences
threaten
the
stability
of
the
american
railway
system
the
wages
of
railway
employes
and
the
prosperity
of
the
great
and
other
allied
industries
is
its
real
significance
and
extent
perceived
even
by
those
most
immediately
interested
that
such
a
threat
now
hangs
over
the
railway
industry
of
america
and
every
employe
and
industry
dependent
upon
it
is
too
plain
for
argument
the
situation
is
acute
and
nothing
but
a
prompt
adjustment
of
the
rates
obtained
for
the
services
rendered
to
offset
partially
at
least
the
loss
in
the
value
of
the
money
received
will
prevent
disaster
that
such
an
adjustment
if
effected
now
will
at
best
be
tardy
and
belated
is
evident
from
the
facts
herein
presented
which
show
that
prices
in
every
other
industry
and
the
wages
of
all
artisans
were
long
ago
adjusted
to
this
fundamental
condition

of

new
york
november
circumstances
over
which
i
had
no
control
caused
me
to
be
born
with
a
distinct
inability
to
think
consecutively
or
talk
coherently
in
a
standing
position
and
before
an
audience
seated
on
the
small
of
my
back
with
my
feet
on
the
desk
i
sometimes
think
i
am
thinking
but
when
i
get
before
an
audience
i
am
like
the
little
steamer
plying
on
the
sangamon
river
that
had
a
boiler
and
a
whistle
when
she
whistled
she
stopped
but
my
weakness
or
rather
one
of
my
weaknesses
is
susceptibility
to
flattery
and
when
one
of
your
officers
represented
in
honeyed
phrase
the
importance
of
your
organization
and
of
this
meeting
and
laid
particular
stress
upon
the
importance
of
my
saying
something
i
weakly
yielded
i
know
the
result
will
be
disappointment
but
the
responsibility
is
only
partly
mine
and
you
know
we
railroad
men
get
so
little
flattery
that
when
properly
administered
the
result
is
intoxicating
also
let
me
state
in
extenuation
of
the
crime
i
am
about
to
commit
that
the
subject
was
not
my
own
selection
but
was
chosen
for
me
my
natural
disposition
in
discussing
railroads
and
the
public
is
to
growl
while
if
i
understand
your
officers
wishes
i
am
here
expected
to
purr
but
while
a
better
man
might
have
been
selected
to
say
it
there
is
much
to
be
said
as
to
the
railroads
and
public
opinion
in
this
country
the
people
rule
and
in
the
long
run
that
system
that
method
or
that
personality
that
does
not
meet
the
approbation
of
the
public
can
not
succeed
true
the
public
is
often
fooled
true
it
gets
on
the
wrong
feet
as
often
perhaps
as
on
the
right
true
it
has
to
be
guided
controlled
and
at
times
abruptly
stopped
by
those
authorities
which
it
has
selected
for
that
purpose
yet
the
fact
remains
that
the
government
of
the
people
that
congress
the
legislatures
and
even
the
courts
are
keenly
alive
to
public
sentiment
and
anxious
not
to
stray
far
from
the
line
of
public
opinion
our
forefathers
recognized
the
danger
that
the
majority
would
not
necessarily
be
right
but
might
often
be
wrong
and
sought
to
provide
safeguards
for
the
rights
of
the
minority
but
these
safeguards
are
obviously
growing
less
efficient
obviously
growing
weaker
obviously
more
sensitive
to
the
public
clamor
which
for
the
moment
stands
for
public
opinion
and
when
all
safeguards
have
been
exhausted
it
is
to
public
opinion
that
we
must
look
at
last
there
are
two
things
about
which
the
public
is
most
critical
one
is
the
management
of
the
newspaper
the
other
the
management
of
the
railroad
in
his
heart
the
average
citizen
believes
that
he
could
operate
either
his
daily
newspaper
or
the
railroad
passing
through
his
town
much
better
than
it
is
being
operated
he
would
perhaps
hesitate
to
announce
this
opinion
but
his
attitude
is
coldly
critical
and
it
is
to
be
remembered
that
the
railroad
is
all
out
of
doors
all
out
in
the
weather
everything
about
it
exposed
to
the
limelight
and
visible
to
anybody
naked
eye
there
is
no
human
activity
the
operation
of
which
is
attended
with
so
much
publicity
all
our
earnings
and
expenses
are
published
all
our
charges
and
all
our
methods
the
subject
of
regulation
intelligent
or
otherwise
many
years
ago
vanderbilt
journeying
to
chicago
was
met
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
by
an
enterprising
reporter
for
a
daily
paper
who
boarded
the
train
and
forced
himself
into
the
presence
of
vanderbilt
and
his
party
and
demanded
news
on
behalf
of
the
public
probably
vanderbilt
resenting
the
intrusion
said
something
uncomplimentary
to
the
reporter
and
possibly
to
the
public
he
claimed
to
represent
and
the
next
issue
of
that
paper
quoted
him
in
scare
headlines
as
using
the
phrase
the
public
be
damned
vanderbilt
subsequently
denied
having
said
it
but
whether
he
did
or
not
and
whatever
may
have
been
his
provocation
the
phrase
has
for
nearly
forty
years
been
used
as
indicative
of
the
railway
man
attitude
toward
his
patrons
many
years
ago
also
the
late
george
blanchard
being
on
the
witness
stand
at
albany
was
asked
what
was
the
correct
basis
for
making
freight
rates
and
replied
what
the
traffic
will
bear
a
most
excellent
answer
but
a
most
unfortunate
one
for
it
has
passed
into
history
as
meaning
all
the
traffic
will
bear
which
is
a
very
different
thing
such
things
as
these
distorted
as
they
have
been
conspired
to
inflame
public
opinion
but
that
is
not
all
it
is
the
custom
and
privilege
of
men
past
middle
age
to
be
reminiscent
and
i
ask
your
indulgence
for
a
very
brief
history
of
the
events
that
have
led
us
to
our
present
status
my
railroad
experience
began
about
forty
years
ago
and
the
railroad
business
was
then
much
like
any
other
business
it
had
its
price
list
as
did
the
merchant
but
like
the
merchant
it
had
its
discounts
for
large
shippers
and
for
special
conditions
and
the
discounts
were
irregular
and
various
the
larger
shippers
demanded
concessions
as
a
right
and
the
principle
was
generally
admitted
naturally
the
result
was
favoritism
not
because
the
railroads
desired
especially
to
favor
one
as
against
another
but
because
in
the
nature
of
things
secret
rates
could
not
well
be
given
to
everybody
nobody
regarded
these
secret
rates
as
criminal
or
objectionable
but
as
time
passed
and
these
discriminations
became
more
frequent
and
greater
there
arose
a
demand
from
the
less
favored
portion
of
the
shipping
community
for
legislation
forbidding
the
discrimination
and
providing
for
like
opportunity
for
all
this
was
strenuously
opposed
by
the
favored
shippers
and
by
those
railroad
men
who
believed
the
railroad
to
be
purely
a
private
institution
and
not
amenable
to
law
as
to
its
charges
it
was
common
enough
to
hear
it
seriously
argued
that
the
larger
shipper
was
entitled
to
the
lower
rate
this
view
was
held
by
many
shippers
and
i
believe
by
most
railroad
managers
they
argued
that
the
business
was
like
any
other
business
that
each
interest
must
look
out
for
itself
and
that
competition
between
the
roads
would
prevent
rates
from
ever
being
too
high
for
myself
i
may
say
that
i
realized
from
an
early
period
that
discrimination
as
to
rates
was
unjust
and
at
no
time
objected
to
laws
forbidding
it
the
interstate
commerce
law
was
passed
in
it
was
crude
in
its
provisions
and
was
the
result
of
compromises
between
radicals
and
conservatives
it
sought
both
to
foster
competition
and
to
abolish
it
and
in
that
respect
remains
still
contradictory
and
impossible
upon
the
passage
of
the
law
that
which
had
been
looked
upon
as
perfectly
proper
and
as
the
working
of
natural
competitive
forces
became
illegal
and
criminal
the
railroads
generally
accepted
the
law
and
made
an
honest
effort
to
observe
it
the
mercantile
community
did
not
indeed
they
openly
defied
it
soliciting
rebates
unblushingly
and
threatening
with
the
loss
of
their
tonnage
those
roads
who
would
not
succumb
the
interstate
commission
new
to
its
duties
contented
itself
with
comparatively
unimportant
decisions
and
practically
did
nothing
to
help
those
railroads
who
desired
honestly
to
carry
out
the
provisions
of
the
law
and
as
a
result
within
a
year
of
the
passage
of
the
law
it
was
quite
generally
disregarded
a
few
railroad
men
were
fined
a
few
shippers
convicted
and
almost
immediately
pardoned
and
the
law
fell
into
disrepute
a
condition
disgraceful
alike
to
the
government
the
shippers
and
the
railroads
and
especially
distasteful
to
the
latter
but
exactly
what
was
to
be
expected
the
result
was
the
passage
of
the
elkins
bill
and
later
the
hepburn
bill
which
while
amateurish
and
in
many
ways
vicious
have
effectually
stopped
the
rebate
system
a
result
for
which
we
may
all
be
thankful
in
all
the
controversies
that
have
led
up
to
this
almost
complete
control
of
railroad
earnings
and
railroad
policies
by
governmental
agencies
the
railroads
have
as
a
rule
acted
in
active
opposition
they
have
not
been
unanimous
some
of
us
were
willing
to
accept
it
long
before
it
became
a
fact
but
the
majority
could
see
nothing
in
it
but
disaster
it
is
too
early
to
say
which
was
right
perhaps
an
earlier
acceptance
of
control
would
have
made
the
control
more
lenient
perhaps
its
earlier
acceptance
would
on
the
other
hand
have
bound
the
chains
more
tightly
but
the
fact
remains
that
while
the
basic
principle
of
absolute
equality
as
to
rates
has
been
accepted
by
the
railroads
gladly
and
in
all
good
faith
and
they
have
also
accepted
the
principle
of
government
regulation
the
scars
of
the
conflict
remain
and
a
large
section
of
the
public
still
suspects
and
misjudges
us
it
is
true
of
course
that
in
the
rapid
development
of
our
business
and
in
the
exigencies
of
a
most
exacting
profession
there
have
been
abuses
and
lapses
but
i
am
here
to
maintain
that
the
standards
of
fair
dealing
and
commercial
honesty
in
our
business
have
been
as
high
as
in
any
other
and
i
appeal
to
you
who
sit
around
this
table
to
say
if
it
be
not
so
but
whatever
sins
may
be
laid
at
our
door
however
much
we
may
have
once
believed
that
ours
was
a
private
business
to
be
controlled
exclusively
by
its
owners
however
much
we
have
resented
or
still
resent
the
interference
of
the
public
as
manifested
in
the
various
governing
bodies
it
is
after
all
the
public
that
is
master
and
we
must
all
recognize
it
it
is
however
still
our
privilege
to
exercise
our
right
as
citizens
and
members
of
the
body
politic
to
use
our
efforts
to
guide
it
acknowledging
as
we
must
that
the
public
is
the
question
is
how
may
we
satisfy
our
masters
and
thus
mitigate
our
woes
and
preserve
our
properties
first
we
must
realize
as
i
think
we
all
do
after
a
series
of
very
hard
knocks
that
the
railroads
are
not
strictly
private
property
but
subject
to
regulation
by
the
public
through
its
regularly
constituted
authorities
that
the
government
may
reduce
our
earnings
and
increase
our
expenses
has
been
sufficiently
proved
second
to
meet
this
situation
we
must
endeavor
to
get
in
touch
with
public
opinion
perhaps
you
will
smile
when
i
say
that
for
years
i
have
read
every
article
on
railroad
matters
in
each
of
the
papers
published
along
our
ten
thousand
miles
of
road
not
an
easy
task
for
a
busy
man
but
while
i
have
waded
through
much
chaff
i
am
sure
it
has
resulted
in
some
reforms
third
the
avoidance
of
action
seriously
counter
to
public
opinion
except
for
compelling
reasons
fourth
the
disposition
to
explain
these
reasons
through
officers
and
employes
of
all
grades
generally
the
loudest
criticisms
come
from
those
who
are
not
anxious
to
know
the
truth
fifth
efforts
to
improve
service
in
many
cases
without
hope
of
reward
and
for
the
deliberate
purpose
of
winning
public
approval
such
as
better
stations
improved
heating
and
lighting
devices
better
equipment
better
terminal
facilities
separation
of
grades
all
with
due
regard
to
the
rights
of
those
whose
money
we
are
spending
as
we
do
all
these
things
meet
us
half
way
encourage
the
habit
of
not
rushing
into
abuse
try
to
consider
the
facts
and
the
difficulties
this
is
for
the
public
interest
as
well
as
ours
oppose
unnecessary
and
restrictive
legislation
and
give
us
a
chance
most
of
our
railroads
are
mere
imitations
of
what
a
railroad
should
be
and
what
it
must
be
to
keep
abreast
of
the
country
yet
even
the
poorest
serves
a
useful
purpose
and
can
not
be
spared
an
eminent
authority
has
said
that
five
thousand
millions
of
dollars
would
be
required
to
supply
the
transportation
needs
of
the
next
decade
and
i
do
not
believe
it
is
an
can
private
capital
be
found
to
that
amount
unless
public
sentiment
is
willing
to
assure
it
of
return
a
portion
of
the
public
is
clamoring
for
facilities
involving
great
additions
to
expenses
another
portion
for
limitation
of
earnings
will
the
investor
consent
to
accept
the
risks
while
strictly
limited
as
to
his
return
since
the
public
may
do
as
it
will
with
us
and
since
we
are
necessary
to
the
public
we
may
properly
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
railway
investments
already
pay
less
than
any
other
line
and
to
ask
what
is
to
be
done
really
it
is
quite
as
much
the
public
affair
as
ours
is
it
certain
that
the
mixture
of
private
ownership
and
public
regulation
which
is
now
prevalent
will
succeed
is
it
not
contrary
to
all
rules
of
political
economy
and
to
all
the
teachings
of
history
starting
as
a
purely
private
industry
it
has
been
appropriated
in
part
and
other
parts
are
apparently
to
follow
granting
whatever
may
be
claimed
for
the
advantages
of
regulation
by
government
do
not
equity
and
ordinary
commercial
decency
require
that
such
close
restriction
and
supervision
should
be
accompanied
by
some
guaranty
of
return
i
have
endeavored
to
sketch
briefly
what
should
be
the
attitude
of
the
railway
man
a
railway
man
toward
the
public
i
am
sure
i
voice
the
sentiment
of
all
managing
railroad
officers
when
i
say
that
our
great
desire
is
to
please
the
public
and
to
give
it
the
best
possible
service
for
the
least
possible
compensation
consistent
with
reason
discriminations
have
long
since
passed
away
and
nobody
is
better
pleased
than
the
railroad
man
that
it
is
so
there
is
no
desire
to
escape
either
responsibility
or
regulation
we
desire
to
accord
only
justice
and
we
ask
in
return
only
justice
may
i
now
as
a
citizen
appeal
to
the
railway
employe
to
the
members
of
this
association
and
to
all
other
good
citizens
to
resist
to
the
utmost
of
their
powers
the
encroachment
of
government
on
private
rights
elbert
hubbard
of
east
aurora
recently
remarked
that
when
god
sent
a
current
of
common
sense
through
the
universe
most
of
the
reformers
wore
rubber
boots
and
stood
on
glass
our
troubles
are
with
this
class
men
who
have
zeal
without
knowledge
and
enthusiasm
without
sanity
these
we
may
not
reach
but
the
great
mass
of
the
solid
and
substantial
citizenship
may
perhaps
be
induced
to
stop
and
consider
whither
we
are
drifting
and
whether
this
greatest
of
all
the
country
industries
is
being
fairly
treated
railroads
and
the
public
by
hon
john
spooner
from
the
address
delivered
at
the
annual
dinner
of
the
railway
business
association
new
york
november
the
topic
which
has
been
assigned
to
me
is
brief
but
very
large
railroads
and
the
public
it
suggests
nothing
of
humor
but
everything
of
gravity
and
involves
considerations
which
affect
the
prosperity
of
our
whole
people
the
railroads
often
berated
in
legislatures
and
in
congresses
as
leechlike
and
piratical
are
after
all
vital
to
the
happiness
of
our
people
and
to
the
progress
of
our
industries
and
commerce
the
people
are
apt
to
forget
that
they
have
been
the
greatest
factors
i
say
the
factors
in
the
development
of
our
resources
and
the
enlargement
of
our
commerce
both
in
times
of
war
and
in
times
of
peace
if
one
would
stop
to
think
of
what
would
have
happened
if
during
the
war
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
we
had
been
without
railroads
ready
and
willing
to
serve
the
government
upon
its
demand
and
at
prices
fixed
by
it
how
long
would
the
war
have
continued
and
what
might
not
have
been
its
result
they
carried
troops
from
the
north
to
the
places
of
rendezvous
in
the
fields
they
enabled
the
government
to
transfer
quickly
from
the
east
to
the
west
or
the
west
to
the
east
as
emergency
demanded
troops
essential
to
successful
military
operations
they
carried
munitions
of
war
they
carried
the
mail
to
our
soldiers
they
carried
food
and
raiment
to
those
who
were
fighting
under
our
flag
and
in
time
of
peace
what
would
this
country
have
been
without
the
railroads
the
railroad
has
been
the
advance
courier
of
progress
of
settlement
of
production
of
commerce
it
is
absolutely
and
has
been
indispensable
to
the
government
to
the
commerce
and
to
the
happiness
and
comfort
of
our
people
its
mission
is
not
performed
or
fulfilled
considered
solely
with
reference
to
construction
there
are
new
fields
to
be
penetrated
by
them
today
men
of
courage
and
men
of
means
are
building
railways
with
characteristic
american
energy
in
far
off
alaska
to
bring
the
gold
mines
and
the
coal
mines
and
the
timber
and
the
unknown
resources
of
that
distant
territory
into
the
markets
of
the
united
states
if
there
is
one
instrumentality
which
above
another
has
been
a
factor
appreciable
by
all
thoughtful
men
in
making
this
country
what
it
is
it
is
the
railroad
and
the
railroad
has
kept
abreast
with
the
demands
of
commerce
every
device
which
ingenuity
or
invention
has
presented
has
been
promptly
adopted
by
the
railway
companies
of
the
country
they
have
kept
abreast
of
invention
and
improvement
until
today
the
railway
system
of
the
united
states
is
the
most
luxurious
the
safest
the
best
managed
railway
system
under
the
bending
sky
the
first
thing
that
would
occur
to
one
from
this
toast
the
railroads
being
first
mentioned
is
what
do
the
railroad
companies
owe
to
the
public
that
is
easily
defined
they
owe
it
to
the
public
to
furnish
safe
roadbeds
and
equipment
they
owe
it
to
the
public
to
furnish
prompt
service
they
owe
it
to
the
public
to
treat
all
men
with
obvious
limitations
passengers
and
shippers
under
the
same
circumstances
equally
and
without
unjust
discrimination
and
they
owe
to
the
public
the
duty
of
as
far
as
it
is
possible
so
maintaining
their
roads
and
their
equipment
as
to
be
able
to
meet
in
a
fair
way
all
the
demands
of
commerce
and
traffic
at
reasonable
rates
that
excludes
the
rebate
which
never
had
any
justification
in
logic
or
in
fair
play
i
think
those
who
hated
it
most
were
those
who
felt
obliged
to
adopt
it
when
one
railway
company
gave
rebates
it
is
quite
manifest
that
the
competitor
was
obliged
to
or
go
out
of
business
and
i
believe
that
railway
companies
of
the
united
states
were
glad
and
their
officers
were
glad
when
it
was
made
a
penal
offense
for
railway
companies
to
give
rebates
i
think
a
railway
company
owes
to
the
public
to
be
careful
in
the
selection
of
its
employes
they
should
be
capable
of
course
and
they
should
not
only
be
capable
but
they
should
be
courteous
and
polite
to
sum
it
up
you
would
say
that
what
the
railway
in
the
enlarged
sense
which
includes
details
owes
to
the
public
is
just
and
fair
treatment
what
does
the
public
owe
to
the
railway
companies
precisely
as
i
view
it
the
same
thing
just
and
fair
treatment
only
that
and
nothing
more
everybody
knows
that
the
railway
companies
of
the
united
states
i
wo
put
it
that
way
that
the
railway
system
of
the
united
states
never
could
have
been
created
without
the
utilization
of
corporate
entities
partnerships
never
could
have
concentrated
the
capital
necessary
to
that
end
only
corporations
could
have
achieved
it
that
was
true
in
the
past
and
it
always
will
be
true
now
why
is
the
railway
company
different
from
other
corporations
most
other
corporations
one
trouble
with
the
general
public
is
that
they
do
seem
to
understand
and
they
are
not
perhaps
to
be
chided
for
it
their
relation
to
the
railway
company
they
think
and
they
are
told
they
have
been
told
it
in
congress
and
they
have
been
told
it
where
one
would
least
have
expected
it
that
railway
corporations
are
public
corporations
and
they
have
been
taught
to
believe
that
their
power
over
public
corporations
was
supreme
which
is
not
far
from
the
truth
but
the
railway
corporation
is
not
a
public
corporation
the
supreme
court
has
many
times
decided
that
a
railway
company
is
a
private
corporation
that
its
property
is
private
property
under
the
protection
and
safeguards
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
against
the
public
as
well
as
against
individuals
who
attack
it
then
wherein
lies
the
difference
between
a
private
corporation
engaged
in
manufacture
and
a
railway
corporation
right
here
a
railway
corporation
can
not
construct
its
railway
without
being
clothed
with
a
power
which
is
not
given
to
the
usual
private
corporation
a
power
which
inheres
in
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
the
ultimate
power
of
the
people
delegated
to
the
railway
corporations
and
very
few
others
and
that
is
the
power
to
take
your
land
without
your
will
at
a
price
fixed
not
by
you
but
by
a
jury
why
because
it
is
for
the
public
use
and
private
interest
and
private
sentiment
can
not
be
permitted
to
obstruct
the
interest
of
the
state
and
therefore
the
property
of
a
railway
company
while
it
is
private
property
is
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
said
affected
with
the
public
interest
a
railway
company
serves
the
public
that
is
what
it
is
organized
to
do
those
who
apply
for
the
corporate
franchises
do
not
apply
for
an
altruistic
purpose
they
wish
it
because
they
think
they
can
make
profit
out
of
it
and
that
is
legitimate
but
the
state
grants
it
for
the
public
use
and
so
it
comes
about
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
regulate
it
mark
what
i
say
to
regulate
it
to
prevent
it
from
exacting
extortionate
rates
from
the
people
to
prevent
it
from
putting
upon
the
people
abuses
in
its
management
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
state
may
take
its
property
that
does
not
mean
that
the
state
may
take
its
management
out
of
the
hands
of
its
owners
it
means
simply
that
the
state
may
protect
the
public
from
any
abdication
by
it
or
violation
by
it
of
its
duty
as
a
common
carrier
and
this
principle
is
too
often
forgotten
in
these
days
regulation
has
apparently
achieved
a
wider
field
for
operation
and
is
deemed
to
be
broad
enough
to
regulate
not
only
the
property
and
the
management
of
the
property
but
the
management
of
everybody
connected
with
it
that
wo
do
why
i
see
it
is
stated
in
the
report
of
your
business
association
that
commissions
which
have
been
organized
by
the
states
and
the
commission
organized
under
the
act
of
congress
have
come
to
stay
of
course
they
have
come
we
know
that
and
we
know
another
thing
that
whenever
a
governmental
commission
comes
it
stays
the
commissions
in
the
states
most
of
the
states
god
knows
i
wish
i
could
say
all
the
states
but
i
can
not
truthfully
have
subserved
a
useful
purpose
the
state
lays
down
the
rule
and
the
commission
administers
the
law
there
is
one
thing
about
a
commission
in
the
regulation
under
the
law
of
railway
carriers
which
places
it
in
respect
of
proprietary
fairness
and
fitness
for
that
function
far
above
congress
or
any
other
legislative
body
and
that
is
this
that
they
have
time
to
listen
to
investigate
to
get
at
the
truth
which
a
legislative
body
does
not
have
time
to
do
in
the
very
nature
of
things
i
do
not
know
but
i
think
nothing
added
more
to
the
reputation
of
governor
charles
hughes
of
new
york
than
the
fact
that
he
refused
to
sign
a
bill
but
vetoed
it
reducing
the
rates
which
railway
companies
might
charge
upon
the
ground
that
there
had
been
no
investigation
which
enabled
fair
judgment
as
to
what
was
fair
treatment
to
the
railway
corporations
i
was
in
public
life
a
good
many
years
and
i
am
a
firm
believer
in
the
sober
second
thought
of
the
american
people
for
it
represents
the
average
judgment
of
every
class
of
our
people
but
they
get
wrong
they
get
wrong
about
men
and
they
get
wrong
about
policies
and
measures
they
are
subject
en
masse
as
men
are
individually
to
moments
of
passion
and
excitement
and
they
know
it
as
webster
said
and
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
has
said
the
fundamental
object
of
a
constitution
adopted
by
the
people
is
that
they
may
protect
themselves
against
themselves
in
moments
of
excitement
and
passion
and
the
american
people
will
always
give
heed
to
the
popular
translation
of
the
phrase
due
process
of
law
that
is
hear
before
you
strike
now
the
commission
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
intended
by
the
congress
which
created
it
to
be
an
absolutely
independent
body
it
was
to
report
to
the
congress
it
was
not
to
be
subject
to
the
command
of
either
house
of
congress
or
of
the
executive
of
the
united
states
it
was
intended
to
be
a
body
i
know
all
of
its
members
and
i
do
not
depreciate
to
the
slightest
extent
the
services
which
it
has
rendered
the
only
criticism
i
would
have
of
it
and
that
does
not
arise
from
its
membership
but
it
is
inherent
in
the
system
is
that
it
is
never
satisfied
with
the
powers
it
has
got
it
is
as
insatiable
as
death
for
power
it
has
been
proposed
that
they
shall
have
the
power
to
regulate
the
issue
of
stocks
and
bonds
by
railway
corporations
created
by
the
states
that
is
if
the
state
which
creates
the
railway
company
authorizes
it
desiring
it
to
utilize
its
privileges
for
the
construction
of
a
new
railroad
to
issue
stock
or
issue
bonds
that
it
shall
not
be
permitted
to
do
that
thing
until
the
act
of
the
legislature
and
the
approval
of
the
governor
shall
have
been
supplemented
by
the
approval
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
now
i
am
getting
along
in
years
and
i
am
a
little
and
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
satisfy
myself
that
where
one
government
creates
a
stock
corporation
another
government
shall
regulate
the
amount
of
its
capital
stock
and
its
bonded
indebtedness
i
have
seen
it
proposed
lately
that
the
commission
should
have
the
power
to
fix
a
rate
and
that
that
rate
should
be
final
until
a
final
judgment
setting
it
aside
was
reached
what
becomes
of
the
constitution
under
such
a
law
as
that
a
railway
company
as
i
have
said
owns
its
property
it
renders
a
compulsory
service
to
the
public
over
its
own
property
with
its
own
equipment
with
its
own
employes
and
at
its
own
risk
and
is
entitled
to
a
fair
compensation
based
upon
the
fair
value
of
the
property
which
it
devotes
to
the
public
convenience
and
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
that
property
can
not
be
taken
because
the
use
of
property
is
the
property
can
not
be
taken
for
the
public
use
without
just
compensation
and
if
the
state
the
legislature
or
the
congress
may
authorize
a
commission
to
fix
a
rate
as
reasonable
and
fair
beyond
which
the
railway
company
may
not
charge
for
services
it
renders
and
require
it
to
observe
that
rate
until
the
final
adjudication
as
to
whether
the
rate
is
reasonable
or
not
and
after
the
lapse
of
months
it
is
decided
that
it
was
unreasonable
how
can
the
railway
company
recover
the
great
sum
in
unreasonable
rates
which
it
had
lost
it
is
a
taking
of
a
private
property
for
a
public
use
without
just
compensation
and
i
deny
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
do
that
thing
i
admit
the
power
and
the
exercise
of
it
to
the
fullest
extent
to
so
far
regulate
railway
corporations
as
to
secure
to
the
public
a
faithful
discharge
of
all
their
duties
to
the
public
at
reasonable
rates
and
under
fair
regulations
beyond
that
i
believe
that
the
owners
of
the
property
ought
to
be
permitted
to
manage
the
property
the
business
of
railway
management
has
become
one
of
the
learned
professions
it
calls
for
some
of
the
brightest
intellects
in
the
country
it
calls
for
the
exercise
of
powers
which
if
devoted
to
the
law
or
to
finance
or
to
any
other
business
would
place
those
who
exercise
it
among
those
at
the
head
it
is
one
of
infinite
complication
and
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
railway
commissions
can
manage
railway
properties
as
well
as
the
men
who
have
been
trained
from
boyhood
to
that
business
i
have
never
questioned
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
commission
in
wisconsin
and
other
commissions
earnestly
set
out
to
do
the
just
and
fair
thing
but
the
trouble
with
this
whole
question
is
and
has
been
through
many
a
year
that
it
gets
too
often
into
politics
i
do
not
believe
myself
that
questions
of
business
ever
ought
to
find
their
way
into
the
political
platform
of
the
party
any
more
than
i
believe
that
the
relations
of
the
employer
to
the
employe
whatever
the
business
may
be
ought
to
become
the
football
of
party
politics
this
association
was
born
out
of
a
happy
inspiration
i
think
these
troublesome
problems
are
approaching
solution
the
railway
companies
must
obey
the
law
the
people
ought
to
see
to
it
that
the
law
which
the
railway
corporations
are
obliged
to
obey
is
a
just
law
and
that
is
to
be
ascertained
only
on
painstaking
inquiry
and
not
through
the
speeches
of
enthusiastic
orators
or
on
the
floors
of
congress
it
has
got
to
be
at
times
that
where
there
was
no
other
issue
upon
which
a
political
contest
could
be
fought
out
the
easy
obvious
and
last
resort
was
let
us
go
for
the
railroads
or
as
a
governor
of
minnesota
once
expressed
it
let
shake
the
railroads
over
hell
the
truth
is
that
the
interest
of
the
railroads
is
the
interest
of
the
people
the
railroad
company
is
dependent
upon
the
people
for
its
life
and
its
sustenance
and
the
people
are
no
less
dependent
upon
the
railway
company
and
between
the
two
there
should
be
justice
they
should
be
dealt
with
calmly
and
legislation
should
only
follow
deliberation
and
investigation
and
a
law
once
enacted
should
be
impersonally
enforced
not
enforced
against
some
and
left
to
fall
into
innocuous
desuetude
as
to
others
railroad
problems
of
today
by
j
thayer
pennsylvania
railroad
company
address
delivered
before
the
traffic
club
of
new
york
saturday
evening
february
problems
both
many
and
varied
have
always
confronted
the
railway
manager
particular
problems
come
to
the
front
from
time
to
time
that
tax
all
of
our
resources
they
differ
with
different
periods
of
our
history
today
one
of
the
most
serious
depends
more
for
its
solution
upon
our
lawmaking
bodies
both
state
and
national
than
upon
the
railroad
men
and
for
the
present
at
least
we
must
feel
like
the
old
arkansas
darky
who
said
he
was
in
the
hands
of
an
and
unscrupulous
providence
in
the
early
days
of
railroads
the
chief
problem
was
that
of
construction
and
equipment
later
when
more
railroads
had
been
built
than
there
was
traffic
to
feed
there
came
the
traffic
problem
and
all
the
abuses
which
followed
in
its
train
these
in
turn
led
to
the
legislative
problem
accompanied
by
the
interstate
commerce
law
of
and
through
the
all
sorts
of
problems
including
bankruptcy
for
many
now
within
the
past
few
years
has
come
the
great
problem
of
enlargement
the
construction
period
again
but
in
a
different
shape
not
experimental
for
we
had
learned
how
to
build
and
how
to
equip
not
the
building
so
much
into
new
country
but
to
take
care
of
the
traffic
which
was
overflowing
our
rails
events
of
the
past
year
have
proved
the
absolute
necessity
for
almost
all
the
large
railroads
in
this
country
to
enlarge
their
trackage
their
terminals
and
their
equipment
and
yet
here
again
when
in
considering
where
to
obtain
the
necessary
funds
for
such
purposes
which
must
of
course
come
from
the
public
the
railroad
managers
find
themselves
confronted
with
great
difficulties
this
of
course
is
largely
due
to
the
tremendous
demands
for
capital
in
the
development
that
is
going
on
in
all
parts
of
the
world
but
it
is
increased
at
the
moment
by
the
natural
timidity
of
capital
to
invest
its
funds
in
railroad
securities
in
view
of
the
violent
attacks
that
are
being
made
against
corporations
through
congress
and
the
state
legislatures
popular
hostility
to
the
railroads
this
brings
us
then
to
our
greatest
and
most
perplexing
problem
that
of
how
to
restore
a
state
of
reciprocal
understanding
and
fairness
between
the
carriers
and
the
public
many
railroad
officials
believe
that
so
is
the
apparent
hostility
of
the
people
that
the
management
of
the
railways
will
be
taken
practically
out
of
the
hands
of
their
owners
and
that
great
disasters
are
to
follow
i
do
not
share
this
view
principally
for
the
reason
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
faults
in
the
past
the
methods
and
practices
of
railroad
management
are
now
based
upon
a
decent
regard
for
their
public
responsibilities
sooner
or
later
the
people
will
recognize
this
as
i
believe
they
are
already
beginning
to
do
but
by
no
means
can
we
minimize
the
actual
situation
of
today
it
is
indeed
a
time
of
great
anxiety
to
all
those
entrusted
with
railroad
management
and
who
have
the
interests
of
their
country
at
heart
as
well
with
the
old
rebates
and
secret
discriminations
things
of
the
past
with
all
kinds
of
business
in
a
most
prosperous
condition
we
all
know
that
within
the
past
three
years
suddenly
out
of
an
almost
cloudless
sky
there
has
burst
forth
upon
the
railroads
of
this
country
a
torrent
of
the
most
bitter
and
violent
attacks
by
political
orators
upon
the
stump
in
magazines
and
newspapers
in
congress
and
state
legislatures
it
is
fair
to
say
i
think
that
this
onslaught
had
its
origin
in
the
agitation
of
for
changes
in
the
interstate
commerce
law
it
was
based
upon
a
misunderstanding
of
existing
railroad
conditions
and
the
position
of
the
railroad
in
regard
to
the
points
at
issue
which
i
shall
presently
explain
following
the
agitation
surrounding
the
passage
of
the
rate
bill
has
come
a
swarm
of
bills
in
congress
and
state
legislatures
which
if
they
become
laws
and
are
enforced
will
prove
disastrous
to
the
railroads
and
equally
so
to
the
public
at
large
the
question
is
what
is
to
be
done
to
prevent
it
the
old
method
of
influence
has
been
abandoned
and
i
hope
forever
has
it
left
us
unequipped
to
meet
the
issue
to
answer
this
question
let
us
get
a
perspective
railroads
not
blameless
we
must
not
imagine
to
begin
with
that
we
are
entirely
blameless
we
are
in
some
respects
only
realizing
the
wages
of
past
sins
we
have
done
many
of
those
things
which
we
ought
not
to
have
done
and
we
have
left
undone
many
of
those
things
we
ought
to
have
done
most
of
the
evils
date
back
many
years
and
many
of
them
might
have
been
prevented
had
the
government
done
its
duty
and
enforced
the
law
yet
even
in
most
recent
years
we
can
find
some
mistakes
with
which
to
concern
ourselves
it
is
not
strange
that
many
men
who
have
suffered
loss
through
delays
in
their
traffic
or
in
their
personal
transportation
or
who
saw
themselves
deprived
of
profitable
business
because
they
could
not
secure
cars
should
have
become
exasperated
and
not
having
time
to
properly
analyze
the
difficulty
thought
that
the
railroads
were
lacking
in
foresight
and
management
but
let
us
go
back
a
few
years
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
hold
the
railroads
responsible
for
such
practices
as
rebating
in
those
days
when
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
throw
a
stone
in
a
commercial
community
without
hitting
somebody
who
was
taking
rebates
and
wanting
more
many
men
are
today
running
for
office
on
platforms
who
if
you
were
to
say
rebates
would
duck
their
heads
very
much
as
david
harum
said
his
newport
friends
would
do
if
he
called
out
low
bridge
that
rebates
were
wrong
nobody
questions
but
to
pillory
a
man
today
for
accepting
rebates
at
that
time
is
a
farce
many
persons
believe
that
the
discriminations
resulting
in
the
secret
arrangements
were
largely
influenced
by
the
desire
upon
the
part
of
railroad
officials
to
favor
one
man
against
another
but
no
thoughtful
man
who
has
at
all
studied
the
problem
believes
this
rebates
and
other
forms
of
discrimination
whatever
may
have
been
the
result
in
specific
instances
had
their
origin
mainly
in
the
competition
between
carriers
for
the
traffic
incidentally
in
transacting
railroad
business
through
secret
arrangements
as
became
the
custom
in
that
period
there
were
many
cases
of
discrimination
in
favor
of
the
strong
and
against
the
weak
there
was
a
strong
feeling
upon
the
part
of
many
men
both
in
and
out
of
railway
service
that
the
larger
shipper
under
the
ordinary
rules
of
business
was
entitled
to
a
lower
rate
and
they
could
not
conceive
the
real
principle
which
should
govern
the
making
of
railroad
rates
which
however
has
come
clearly
to
be
realized
since
that
time
the
railroad
systems
generally
were
not
more
anxious
to
pay
rebates
than
they
were
to
pay
higher
prices
for
their
supplies
and
simply
pursued
the
course
of
their
competitors
because
otherwise
they
saw
nothing
but
loss
and
probable
bankruptcy
staring
them
in
the
face
the
railroads
were
forbidden
by
law
to
meet
and
make
formal
agreements
for
the
maintenance
of
rates
and
by
another
law
were
required
to
compete
we
all
thought
that
the
old
plan
competition
had
the
government
through
its
interstate
commerce
commission
vigorously
undertaken
to
enforce
the
law
passing
if
necessary
long
before
it
did
the
elkins
act
i
think
we
should
have
seen
a
correction
of
these
abuses
long
before
the
reform
came
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
neither
the
government
authorities
nor
many
of
those
managing
the
railroads
had
yet
reached
a
clear
conception
of
the
significance
of
the
abuses
which
existed
and
of
the
proper
legal
method
of
uprooting
those
evils
getting
away
from
old
abuses
upon
the
resumption
of
business
activity
in
and
and
later
following
the
passage
of
the
elkins
act
the
opportunity
was
presented
and
in
general
accepted
by
the
railroads
to
get
away
from
the
old
methods
while
since
then
there
have
been
some
cases
of
violation
of
the
law
in
the
matter
of
secret
arrangements
yet
i
think
that
at
least
within
the
last
four
or
five
years
it
is
safe
to
say
that
they
have
been
of
small
importance
and
perhaps
in
many
of
the
cases
while
a
technical
violation
of
the
law
were
actually
not
discriminations
i
say
this
advisedly
so
far
as
the
eastern
situation
is
concerned
because
i
know
that
the
pennsylvania
railroad
company
has
not
paid
a
rebate
for
years
and
it
is
fair
to
believe
that
as
that
company
held
its
traffic
in
fact
largely
increased
it
without
the
necessity
for
such
arrangements
its
competitors
must
have
to
a
large
extent
pursued
the
same
policy
but
not
alone
in
reference
to
freight
rates
was
there
more
or
less
complicity
in
evil
between
the
people
and
the
railroads
but
let
me
ask
you
to
consider
for
a
moment
the
question
of
free
transportation
or
passes
whether
political
or
business
it
is
only
within
the
last
year
or
two
that
the
public
conscience
has
been
awakened
on
this
subject
it
is
true
the
railroads
have
been
abused
for
several
years
by
those
who
did
not
enjoy
such
favors
but
is
the
railroad
more
responsible
for
the
conditions
that
existed
than
the
government
of
the
people
either
in
the
national
congress
or
in
the
state
legislatures
and
how
could
it
be
expected
that
the
legislators
in
one
state
could
feel
that
they
were
doing
very
wrong
in
accepting
passes
when
the
legislators
of
another
state
enjoyed
them
by
law
of
the
state
how
could
members
of
congress
be
criticised
for
accepting
such
privileges
or
the
railroads
for
extending
them
when
the
presidents
of
the
united
states
and
member
of
their
cabinets
and
other
important
officers
of
the
government
not
only
accepted
them
but
practically
exacted
them
and
further
expected
that
private
cars
and
private
trains
should
be
furnished
without
charge
upon
one
occasion
within
the
past
two
years
i
called
upon
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
ask
its
assistance
in
eliminating
the
pass
abuse
and
was
very
frankly
told
that
it
could
make
no
move
nor
take
any
interest
in
the
subject
in
view
of
the
fact
that
important
public
officials
including
senators
and
the
members
of
congress
felt
that
it
was
not
improper
for
them
to
accept
them
out
of
this
situation
grew
a
large
part
of
the
pass
abuse
because
following
the
national
government
and
the
legislatures
the
large
men
of
business
felt
that
they
could
properly
accept
similar
privileges
therefore
i
repeat
that
while
there
were
great
abuses
especially
during
the
period
referred
to
embittering
a
large
portion
of
people
yet
the
railroads
were
no
more
responsible
than
the
people
themselves
and
yet
without
doubt
it
was
during
this
period
that
the
foundation
was
laid
for
the
feeling
of
the
present
day
railways
welcome
just
regulation
but
as
i
stated
we
were
forced
to
bear
the
brunt
of
our
past
sins
and
more
in
the
campaign
for
increasing
the
powers
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
do
not
misunderstand
me
many
thoughtful
railroad
men
believed
always
in
the
value
both
to
the
railroads
and
the
public
of
an
interstate
law
and
further
considered
it
wise
to
strengthen
the
power
of
the
commission
the
distinction
however
between
what
railroad
men
did
and
did
not
believe
in
is
very
clear
we
felt
and
we
feel
now
that
the
government
is
perfectly
justified
in
regulating
railroad
practices
to
the
extent
of
preventing
discriminations
indeed
the
government
should
act
as
a
sort
of
policeman
to
see
to
it
that
the
weak
and
the
helpless
are
protected
if
reasonably
administered
the
railroads
need
the
law
but
the
government
should
not
have
the
right
to
interfere
with
the
proper
play
of
the
natural
commercial
forces
of
the
nation
the
great
distinction
between
police
and
commercial
powers
should
never
be
lost
sight
of
the
danger
does
not
lie
in
the
provisions
of
the
new
national
law
there
is
no
substantial
difference
between
its
provisions
and
those
of
the
old
law
except
in
respect
to
the
powers
of
the
commission
there
was
no
necessity
for
the
new
law
so
far
as
the
prevention
of
the
old
abuse
of
secret
rates
and
discrimination
was
concerned
the
operation
of
this
law
does
not
involve
any
material
change
in
traffic
operations
of
the
railroads
the
only
danger
is
as
to
how
the
commission
may
exercise
their
power
in
influencing
reductions
in
rates
but
even
in
that
respect
the
railroads
have
the
right
of
appeal
to
the
courts
it
is
from
various
other
bills
being
presented
in
congress
in
which
the
immediate
danger
lies
showing
possible
interference
by
the
national
government
with
the
operation
of
railroads
with
respect
to
the
hours
of
labor
of
its
employes
systems
of
signals
and
other
methods
of
operation
which
should
properly
be
left
to
the
railroads
themselves
this
threatened
interference
of
the
federal
government
is
having
a
powerful
and
dangerous
influence
upon
the
legislatures
of
the
various
states
who
apparently
are
in
a
slang
term
seeing
congress
and
going
them
five
or
six
better
in
the
bills
for
reduction
of
state
rates
both
passenger
and
freight
for
increase
in
taxation
and
all
sorts
of
measures
which
tend
to
reduce
the
earnings
and
increase
the
expenses
and
hamper
and
delay
the
actual
development
necessary
it
was
unfortunate
that
in
the
agitation
and
discussion
following
the
president
recommendations
until
the
present
law
was
finally
adopted
there
was
a
total
misunderstanding
upon
the
part
of
the
public
at
large
as
to
this
attitude
of
the
railroads
it
was
most
unfortunate
in
that
campaign
that
the
principal
point
of
contest
upon
the
part
of
the
railroads
was
lost
sight
of
and
that
is
the
objection
upon
their
part
not
to
reasonable
amendments
to
the
law
and
not
if
the
people
wanted
it
to
some
increase
of
power
to
the
commission
but
to
the
attempt
to
make
a
commission
of
five
or
seven
men
in
many
respects
a
political
body
the
final
arbiters
as
to
the
rates
and
fares
of
the
railroads
difficulties
under
the
present
law
yet
even
with
the
new
law
on
the
statute
books
our
traffic
problems
are
still
with
us
we
are
forbidden
by
law
to
make
formal
agreements
as
to
rates
yet
it
is
universally
recognized
that
in
order
to
secure
an
equitable
adjustment
of
rates
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
traffic
managers
of
the
railroads
shall
confer
frequently
it
is
well
known
that
such
conferences
are
held
and
must
be
held
to
prevent
discriminations
yet
no
definite
agreements
can
be
made
the
present
law
stipulates
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
by
railroads
against
persons
or
communities
right
here
however
the
railroads
are
face
to
face
with
a
problem
all
their
own
which
is
a
very
serious
one
and
that
is
how
shall
a
particular
railroad
prevent
discrimination
against
a
community
on
its
own
line
by
some
other
railroad
seeking
to
specially
favor
a
community
on
its
line
is
it
not
absolutely
essential
that
there
should
be
both
an
understanding
and
a
virtual
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
two
railroads
concerned
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
both
communities
cases
of
dispute
between
railroads
as
to
proper
rate
adjustments
have
indeed
been
referred
to
interstate
commerce
commissioners
as
arbitrators
and
their
findings
have
been
observed
this
shows
how
absolutely
vital
to
all
business
is
the
necessity
for
that
which
can
only
be
secured
by
agreement
and
conference
between
all
interested
parties
the
president
of
the
united
states
recognized
the
necessity
for
this
fact
in
his
last
annual
message
and
recommended
that
some
legislation
be
passed
which
would
permit
agreements
between
railroads
as
to
rates
we
are
thus
in
the
presence
of
this
ridiculous
situation
that
on
the
one
hand
we
are
being
threatened
with
prosecution
by
the
government
for
violation
of
the
sherman
act
in
respect
to
methods
which
on
the
other
hand
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
the
interstate
commerce
commissioners
agree
must
be
followed
in
order
to
properly
discharge
our
responsibility
to
the
public
in
other
words
we
are
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
or
we
are
damned
if
we
do
or
we
are
damned
if
we
do
so
much
for
the
moment
for
our
national
problem
as
to
state
regulation
while
not
believing
now
that
we
have
a
national
law
that
it
is
necessary
or
desirable
for
the
public
to
establish
state
commissions
and
special
railroad
laws
at
the
same
time
if
the
people
desire
such
commissions
we
have
no
right
to
look
upon
such
a
demand
as
anarchistic
but
we
feel
that
the
working
of
such
commissions
will
be
unsatisfactory
to
the
business
interests
confidence
and
justice
needed
these
are
but
a
few
of
our
problems
and
difficulties
while
i
do
not
wish
to
minimize
the
dangers
of
the
present
situation
while
i
recognize
that
it
is
now
to
some
extent
by
adding
to
the
timidity
of
investors
retarding
our
ability
to
secure
funds
necessary
to
make
extensions
and
buy
equipment
required
for
the
traffic
of
the
country
and
if
continued
will
make
it
impossible
yet
i
am
firmly
of
the
opinion
that
the
good
sense
of
the
people
will
prevail
and
the
unjust
attacks
cease
confidence
of
investors
both
here
and
abroad
is
needed
to
furnish
funds
and
if
this
is
seriously
shaken
the
prosperity
of
the
railroads
which
are
the
keystone
of
the
arch
of
business
will
be
destroyed
to
avoid
these
dangers
a
regime
of
confidence
and
fairness
on
the
part
of
the
public
toward
the
railroads
must
be
restored
and
to
accomplish
this
we
must
place
our
case
as
it
were
before
the
legislators
and
the
people
and
make
clear
our
difficulties
and
the
complications
which
beset
us
few
after
all
understand
the
railroad
problem
and
we
have
not
made
it
plain
to
the
people
either
because
it
was
the
fashion
not
to
do
so
or
because
we
could
not
realize
that
things
simple
to
us
were
not
understood
by
the
public
we
must
not
stop
at
one
statement
but
discourse
upon
and
elucidate
every
subject
which
the
public
misunderstands
let
us
be
frank
and
take
the
public
into
our
confidence
as
fully
as
is
consistent
with
the
proper
conduct
of
our
business
let
us
approach
the
subject
with
the
feeling
that
the
railroads
are
not
absolutely
perfect
that
we
have
to
some
extent
brought
this
condition
of
affairs
upon
ourselves
and
that
we
should
govern
ourselves
in
the
future
accordingly
let
us
undertake
to
go
frankly
before
the
people
and
present
the
actual
facts
in
connection
with
our
affairs
the
pennsylvania
as
an
illustration
let
me
illustrate
the
pennsylvania
legislature
is
in
session
numerous
bills
have
been
presented
of
a
most
radical
nature
it
is
our
purpose
to
appear
before
every
committee
that
will
hear
us
and
tell
our
side
of
the
story
i
doubt
very
much
if
the
average
legislator
and
certainly
not
the
average
citizen
understands
whom
he
is
injuring
in
unjust
acts
towards
the
railroads
take
our
company
for
example
it
is
not
a
small
group
of
rich
capitalists
it
is
not
mccrea
and
myself
and
a
few
others
the
pennsylvania
railroad
is
owned
by
more
than
people
per
cent
of
whom
live
in
pennsylvania
per
cent
of
our
shareholders
are
women
and
in
many
cases
the
dividend
is
their
only
source
of
income
then
there
are
thousands
of
bondholders
beyond
them
are
nearly
employes
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
dependent
upon
the
prosperity
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
for
their
livelihood
therefore
by
the
usual
computation
it
is
safe
to
say
that
approximately
half
a
million
people
men
women
and
children
are
actually
dependent
upon
the
welfare
of
this
company
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
alone
upon
the
pennsylvania
railroad
prosperity
depends
the
prosperity
of
the
other
lines
in
its
system
and
including
the
employes
of
these
lines
there
are
men
who
with
their
families
constitute
an
army
of
a
million
or
more
behind
them
again
are
the
thousands
of
men
with
their
families
who
produce
the
coal
and
other
materials
which
the
railroads
use
anything
that
cripples
the
railroads
injures
every
one
of
these
people
when
we
make
these
and
other
facts
plain
i
can
not
but
feel
that
no
injustice
will
be
done
in
the
meantime
let
us
keep
our
minds
well
balanced
and
not
allow
ourselves
to
believe
that
chaos
is
coming
let
us
meet
the
issue
fairly
and
squarely
and
frankly
while
therefore
necessary
for
the
present
at
least
to
suspend
many
improvements
let
us
keep
our
courage
trusting
to
the
ultimate
good
sense
of
the
lawmakers
and
the
people
for
that
sympathy
and
support
to
which
we
feel
that
we
are
entitled
the
relation
of
railroads
to
the
state
by
acworth
a
delivered
before
the
british
association
at
dublin
ireland
september
i
propose
to
treat
the
subject
in
two
aspects
first
the
history
in
outline
of
the
relations
between
railroads
and
the
state
in
different
countries
and
second
the
question
of
the
factors
which
are
of
primary
importance
in
any
consideration
of
the
matter
ever
since
the
year
when
the
dramatic
success
of
the
liverpool
manchester
railway
first
revealed
to
a
generation
less
accustomed
than
our
own
to
revolutionary
advances
in
material
efficiency
the
startling
improvements
in
transport
that
railroads
were
about
to
effect
theorists
have
discussed
the
question
whether
state
or
private
ownership
of
railroads
be
in
the
abstract
the
more
desirable
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
in
no
country
has
the
practical
question
shall
the
state
own
or
not
own
the
railroads
been
decided
on
abstract
considerations
the
dominant
considerations
have
always
been
the
historical
political
and
economic
position
of
the
particular
country
at
the
time
when
the
question
came
up
in
concrete
shape
for
decision
belgium
the
belgian
railroads
have
belonged
to
the
state
from
the
outset
because
they
were
constructed
just
after
belgium
separated
from
holland
and
the
available
private
capital
being
in
holland
and
not
in
belgium
king
leopold
and
his
ministers
felt
that
if
the
railroads
were
in
private
hands
that
would
mean
in
dutch
hands
and
the
newly
acquired
independence
of
belgium
would
be
thereby
jeopardized
within
the
last
few
years
this
history
has
repeated
itself
and
the
fact
that
the
bulk
of
the
swiss
railroad
capital
was
held
in
france
and
germany
was
one
main
reason
if
not
main
reason
which
induced
the
swiss
people
to
nationalize
their
railroads
germany
in
germany
years
ago
the
smaller
states
were
regarded
as
the
personal
property
of
their
respective
sovereigns
almost
as
definitely
as
sutherlandshire
is
the
property
of
the
duke
of
sutherland
and
it
was
therefore
as
natural
that
the
dukes
of
oldenburg
or
mecklenburg
should
make
railroads
for
the
development
of
their
estates
as
that
the
duke
of
sutherland
should
build
a
railroad
in
sutherland
australasia
take
again
australasia
in
that
region
the
whole
of
the
railroads
with
negligible
exceptions
now
belong
to
the
different
state
governments
and
the
public
sentiment
that
railroads
ought
to
be
public
property
is
today
so
strong
that
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
any
serious
development
of
private
lines
but
at
the
outset
the
traditional
english
preference
for
private
enterprise
was
just
as
strong
there
as
it
was
at
home
and
it
was
only
the
fact
that
the
whole
of
the
available
private
capital
was
absorbed
in
the
development
of
the
gold
fields
and
that
therefore
if
railroads
were
to
be
built
at
all
public
credit
must
be
pledged
and
english
capital
must
be
obtained
that
caused
the
state
to
go
into
the
railroad
business
italy
take
once
more
the
case
of
italy
in
the
days
when
italy
was
only
a
geographical
expression
the
various
italian
states
experimented
with
railroad
management
of
all
sorts
and
kinds
when
after
italy
was
unified
it
was
necessary
to
adopt
a
national
railroad
policy
and
the
italian
government
instituted
an
inquiry
whose
exhaustiveness
has
not
since
been
approached
the
force
of
circumstances
has
indeed
already
compelled
the
government
to
acquire
the
ownership
of
the
railroads
but
the
commission
reported
that
it
was
not
desirable
that
the
government
should
work
them
the
railroads
were
accordingly
leased
for
a
period
of
years
running
from
to
three
operating
companies
and
it
was
provided
that
the
leases
might
be
broken
at
the
end
of
the
or
the
year
from
the
very
outset
a
condition
of
things
developed
which
had
not
been
contemplated
when
the
leases
were
granted
and
for
which
the
leases
made
no
provision
constant
disputes
took
place
between
the
government
and
their
lessees
capital
for
extensions
and
improvements
was
urgently
needed
neither
party
was
bound
to
find
it
and
agreement
for
finding
it
on
terms
mutually
acceptable
was
impossible
of
attainment
in
the
end
the
government
has
been
forced
to
cut
the
knot
to
break
the
lease
at
the
end
of
the
first
years
period
and
for
the
last
two
years
the
italian
government
has
operated
its
own
railroads
but
it
is
safe
to
say
that
an
preference
for
state
management
over
private
management
played
but
scant
part
in
the
ultimate
decision
general
increase
of
state
control
it
is
impossible
to
review
even
in
the
merest
outline
the
railroad
history
of
all
the
countries
in
the
world
but
the
instances
already
given
will
serve
to
illustrate
my
proposition
that
the
position
in
each
country
depends
not
on
abstract
considerations
but
on
the
practical
facts
of
the
local
situation
yet
one
can
not
look
round
the
world
and
fail
to
recognize
that
the
connection
between
the
railroads
and
the
state
is
everywhere
becoming
more
intimate
year
by
year
whatever
have
been
the
causes
the
fact
remains
that
italy
and
switzerland
have
converted
their
railroads
from
private
to
public
in
germany
the
few
remaining
private
lines
are
becoming
still
fewer
in
belgium
the
process
is
practically
completed
in
austria
it
is
moving
steadily
in
the
same
direction
of
the
total
mileage
is
now
operated
by
the
state
in
russia
the
story
would
have
been
the
same
had
it
not
been
for
the
war
with
japan
even
in
france
whose
railroads
have
a
very
definite
local
and
national
history
of
their
own
an
act
for
the
purchase
of
the
western
railway
by
the
state
was
passed
last
year
by
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
has
now
after
much
contention
been
passed
by
the
senate
within
the
last
few
weeks
but
it
is
not
without
interest
to
note
that
though
a
majority
both
of
deputies
and
of
senators
supported
the
bill
the
representatives
of
the
district
served
by
the
company
were
by
a
large
majority
opposed
to
it
while
the
commercial
community
of
the
whole
of
france
as
represented
by
the
chambers
of
commerce
were
almost
unanimously
hostile
i
so
far
as
can
be
seen
at
present
the
purchase
of
the
western
railway
by
the
state
is
not
likely
to
be
made
a
precedent
for
the
general
nationalization
of
the
french
railroads
still
the
broad
fact
remains
that
a
series
of
railroad
maps
of
the
continent
of
europe
constructed
at
intervals
of
ten
years
would
undoubtedly
show
an
proportion
of
state
lines
and
that
the
last
of
the
series
would
exhibit
the
private
lines
as
very
far
below
the
state
lines
both
in
extent
and
in
volume
of
traffic
a
word
ought
to
be
said
of
holland
not
only
because
holland
is
a
country
with
free
institutions
like
our
own
but
because
the
railroad
position
of
holland
is
unique
the
railroads
of
that
country
were
built
partly
by
the
state
and
partly
by
private
enterprise
but
the
working
has
always
been
wholly
in
private
hands
some
ten
years
ago
however
the
dutch
government
bought
up
the
private
lines
and
rearranged
the
whole
system
the
main
lines
of
the
country
are
now
leased
to
two
operating
companies
so
organized
that
each
company
has
access
to
every
important
town
and
railroad
competition
is
now
practically
ubiquitous
throughout
holland
so
far
there
are
no
signs
that
the
dutch
people
are
otherwise
than
satisfied
with
their
system
now
compare
this
with
france
the
french
government
though
it
has
hitherto
except
on
the
comparatively
unimportant
state
railroads
in
the
southwest
of
the
country
stood
aloof
from
the
actual
operation
has
always
kept
entire
control
of
railroad
construction
and
of
the
allocation
of
new
lines
between
the
several
companies
and
the
french
government
has
proceeded
on
a
principle
diametrically
opposed
to
the
dutch
principle
in
france
railroad
competition
has
as
far
as
possible
been
definitely
excluded
and
the
various
systems
have
been
made
to
meet
not
as
in
holland
at
the
great
towns
but
at
the
points
where
the
competitive
traffic
was
as
near
as
might
be
a
negligible
quantity
now
that
questions
of
competition
and
combination
are
to
the
fore
in
england
and
seem
likely
to
give
very
practical
occupation
to
parliament
in
the
session
of
the
precedents
on
both
sides
are
perhaps
not
without
interest
america
when
we
turn
from
the
continent
of
europe
to
the
continent
of
america
the
position
of
affairs
is
startlingly
dissimilar
the
railroads
of
america
far
surpass
in
length
those
of
the
continent
of
europe
while
in
capital
expenditure
they
are
equal
state
ownership
and
operation
of
railroads
on
the
continent
of
america
is
as
much
the
exception
as
it
is
the
rule
in
europe
in
canada
there
is
one
comparatively
important
state
railroad
the
intercolonial
about
miles
in
length
though
its
earnings
are
quite
considerable
about
per
mile
per
week
it
barely
pays
working
expenses
i
may
add
that
in
all
the
voluminous
literature
of
the
subject
i
have
never
seen
this
line
cited
as
an
example
of
the
benefits
of
state
management
there
is
another
small
line
in
prince
edward
island
which
is
worked
at
a
loss
and
a
third
the
temiskaming
northern
ontario
railway
owned
not
by
the
dominion
but
by
the
provincial
government
which
is
too
new
to
afford
any
ground
for
conclusions
the
federal
government
of
the
united
states
has
never
owned
a
railroad
though
some
of
the
individual
states
did
own
and
in
some
cases
also
work
railroads
in
very
early
days
they
all
burnt
their
fingers
badly
but
the
story
is
so
old
a
one
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
found
any
argument
on
it
today
in
mexico
of
which
i
shall
have
more
to
say
directly
the
state
owns
no
railroads
as
for
central
america
costa
rica
and
honduras
have
some
petty
lines
which
are
worked
at
a
loss
guatemala
had
a
railroad
till
when
it
was
transferred
to
a
private
company
nicaragua
has
also
leased
its
lines
colombia
owns
and
works
at
a
profit
all
of
which
is
said
to
be
devoted
to
betterment
miles
of
line
in
south
america
peru
and
argentina
own
as
far
as
i
am
aware
no
railroads
the
chilian
government
owns
about
miles
out
of
the
miles
in
the
country
needless
to
say
private
capital
has
secured
the
most
profitable
lines
the
government
railroad
receipts
hardly
cover
the
working
expenses
the
brazilian
government
formerly
owned
a
considerable
proportion
of
its
railroad
network
of
nearly
miles
financial
straits
forced
it
some
years
ago
to
dispose
of
a
large
part
to
private
companies
to
the
apparent
advantage
at
once
of
the
taxpayer
the
shareholder
and
the
railroad
customer
about
miles
of
line
are
still
operated
by
the
government
the
receipts
of
which
roughly
speaking
do
a
little
more
than
balance
working
expenses
but
it
may
be
broadly
said
that
the
present
brazilian
policy
is
adverse
to
state
ownership
and
in
favor
of
the
development
of
the
railroad
system
by
private
enterprise
the
united
states
situation
the
question
of
public
ownership
and
operation
was
however
raised
very
definitely
in
the
united
states
only
two
years
ago
when
bryan
made
a
speech
stating
that
his
european
experience
had
convinced
him
that
it
was
desirable
to
nationalize
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
for
many
weeks
after
bryan
pronouncement
was
discussed
in
every
newspaper
and
on
every
platform
from
maine
to
california
practically
bryan
found
no
followers
and
today
though
he
is
the
accepted
candidate
of
the
democratic
party
for
the
presidency
the
subject
has
been
tacitly
shelved
to
some
extent
this
may
have
been
due
to
the
ludicrous
impossibility
if
i
may
say
so
with
all
respect
for
a
possible
president
of
proposals
in
order
presumably
not
to
offend
his
own
democratic
party
the
traditional
upholders
of
the
rights
of
the
several
states
he
seriously
suggested
that
the
federal
government
should
work
the
trunk
lines
and
the
respective
state
governments
the
branches
even
if
anybody
knew
in
every
case
what
is
a
trunk
line
and
what
is
a
branch
the
result
would
be
to
create
an
organism
about
as
useful
for
practical
purposes
as
would
be
a
human
body
in
which
the
spinal
cord
was
severed
from
the
brain
bryan
proposal
was
never
discussed
in
detail
public
sentiment
throughout
the
union
was
unexpectedly
unanimous
against
it
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
nationalization
of
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
is
not
in
sight
at
present
but
though
nationalization
is
nowhere
in
america
a
practical
issue
everywhere
in
america
the
relations
between
the
railroads
and
the
state
have
become
much
closer
within
the
last
few
years
canada
a
few
years
ago
consolidated
its
railroad
laws
and
established
a
railway
commission
to
which
was
given
very
wide
powers
of
control
both
over
railroad
construction
and
operation
and
over
rates
and
fares
for
goods
and
passengers
argentina
has
also
moved
in
the
same
direction
in
the
united
states
not
only
has
there
been
the
passage
by
the
federal
congress
at
washington
of
the
law
amending
the
original
act
to
regulate
commerce
and
giving
much
increased
powers
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
besides
various
other
acts
dealing
with
subsidiary
points
such
as
hours
of
railroad
employes
but
scores
if
not
hundreds
of
acts
have
been
passed
by
the
various
state
legislatures
with
these
it
is
quite
impossible
to
deal
in
detail
many
of
them
impose
new
pecuniary
burdens
upon
the
railroad
companies
as
for
instance
the
obligation
to
carry
passengers
at
the
maximum
rate
of
a
penny
per
mile
all
of
them
speaking
broadly
impose
new
obligations
and
new
restrictions
upon
the
railroad
companies
not
a
few
have
already
been
declared
unconstitutional
and
therefore
invalid
by
the
law
courts
and
when
the
mills
of
american
legal
procedure
shall
at
length
have
finished
their
exceedingly
slow
grinding
it
is
safe
to
prophesy
that
a
good
many
more
will
have
ceased
to
operate
but
for
all
that
the
net
result
of
state
and
federal
legislation
in
the
sessions
of
and
will
unquestionably
be
that
even
after
the
reaction
and
repeal
which
thanks
to
the
wall
street
panic
of
last
year
is
now
in
progress
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
will
in
the
future
be
subject
to
much
more
rigid
and
detailed
control
by
public
authority
than
there
has
been
in
the
past
the
reign
of
railroad
despotism
more
or
less
benevolent
is
definitely
at
an
end
the
reign
of
law
has
begun
it
is
only
to
be
regretted
that
the
quantity
of
the
law
errs
as
much
on
the
side
of
excess
as
its
quality
on
the
side
of
deficiency
the
mexican
situation
apart
from
its
interest
as
a
quite
startling
example
of
how
not
to
do
it
the
recent
railroad
legislation
of
the
united
states
is
only
valuable
as
an
indication
of
the
tendency
universal
in
all
countries
however
governed
for
the
state
to
take
a
closer
control
over
its
railroads
much
more
interesting
as
containing
a
definite
political
ideal
worked
out
in
detail
in
a
statesmanlike
manner
is
the
recent
railroad
legislation
of
mexico
one
may
be
thought
to
be
verging
on
paradox
in
suggesting
that
england
with
seven
centuries
of
parliamentary
history
can
learn
something
from
the
republic
of
mexico
but
for
all
that
i
would
say
with
all
seriousness
that
i
believe
the
relation
between
the
state
and
the
national
railroads
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
and
important
questions
of
modern
politics
and
that
the
one
valuable
and
original
contribution
to
the
solution
of
that
question
which
has
been
made
in
the
present
generation
is
due
to
the
president
of
the
mexican
republic
and
his
finance
minister
señor
limantour
broadly
the
mexican
situation
is
this
the
mexican
railroads
were
in
the
hands
of
foreign
capitalists
english
mainly
so
far
as
the
older
lines
were
concerned
american
in
respect
to
the
newer
railroads
more
especially
those
which
constituted
continuations
southwards
of
the
great
american
railroad
systems
the
foreign
companies
whether
english
or
american
naturally
regarded
mexico
as
a
field
for
earning
dividends
for
their
shareholders
the
american
companies
further
equally
naturally
tended
to
regard
mexico
as
an
annexe
and
of
the
united
states
if
they
thought
at
all
of
the
interest
of
mexico
in
developing
as
an
independent
state
they
were
bound
to
regard
it
with
hostility
rather
than
with
favor
and
such
a
point
of
view
could
hardly
commend
itself
to
the
statesmen
at
the
head
of
the
mexican
government
yet
mexico
is
a
poor
and
undeveloped
country
quite
unable
to
dispense
with
foreign
capital
and
further
it
was
at
least
questionable
whether
mexican
political
virtue
was
sufficiently
to
withstand
the
manifold
temptations
inherent
in
the
direct
management
of
railroads
under
a
parliamentary
under
these
circumstances
the
mexicans
have
adopted
the
following
scheme
for
a
comparatively
small
expenditure
in
actual
cash
coupled
with
a
not
very
serious
obligation
to
guarantee
the
interest
on
necessary
bond
issues
the
mexican
government
have
acquired
such
a
holding
of
deferred
ordinary
stock
in
the
national
railroad
company
of
mexico
as
gives
them
not
indeed
any
immediate
dividend
on
their
investment
but
a
present
control
in
all
essentials
of
the
policy
of
the
company
and
also
prospects
of
considerable
profit
when
the
country
shall
have
further
developed
the
organization
of
the
company
as
a
private
commercial
undertaking
subsists
as
before
a
board
of
directors
elected
in
the
ordinary
manner
by
the
votes
of
shareholders
remains
as
a
barrier
against
political
or
local
pressure
in
the
direction
of
uncommercial
concessions
whether
of
new
lines
or
of
extended
facilities
or
reduced
rates
on
the
old
lines
but
and
here
is
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
new
system
and
the
old
whereas
under
the
old
system
the
final
appeal
was
to
a
body
of
shareholders
with
no
interest
beyond
their
own
dividend
the
majority
shareholder
is
now
the
government
of
mexico
with
every
inducement
to
regard
the
interests
both
present
and
prospective
of
the
country
as
a
whole
irrefragable
theory
of
public
ownership
public
ownership
of
railroads
is
in
theory
irrefragable
railroads
are
a
public
service
it
is
right
that
they
should
be
operated
by
public
servants
in
the
public
interest
unfortunately
especially
in
democratically
organized
communities
the
facts
have
not
infrequently
refused
to
fit
the
theories
and
the
public
servants
have
allowed
or
been
constrained
to
allow
the
railroads
to
be
run
not
in
the
permanent
interest
of
the
community
as
a
whole
but
in
the
temporary
interest
of
that
portion
of
the
community
which
at
the
moment
could
exert
the
most
strenuous
pressure
the
mexican
system
if
it
succeeds
in
establishing
itself
permanently
for
as
yet
it
is
only
on
its
trial
may
perhaps
have
avoided
both
scylla
and
charybdis
faced
with
a
powerful
but
local
and
temporary
demand
the
government
may
be
able
to
reply
that
this
is
a
matter
to
be
dealt
with
on
commercial
lines
by
the
board
of
directors
if
on
the
other
hand
permanent
national
interests
are
involved
the
government
can
exercise
its
reserve
power
as
a
shareholder
can
vote
the
directors
out
of
office
and
so
prevent
the
continuance
of
a
policy
which
would
in
its
judgment
be
prejudicial
to
those
interests
however
much
it
might
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
railroad
as
a
mere
commercial
concern
state
control
or
ownership
the
history
whose
outline
i
have
now
very
briefly
sketched
shows
i
think
that
whereas
there
is
everywhere
a
tendency
towards
further
state
control
the
tendency
towards
absolute
and
is
far
from
being
equally
universal
i
shall
have
a
word
to
say
presently
as
to
the
reasons
why
america
shows
no
signs
of
intention
to
follow
the
example
of
continental
europe
meanwhile
it
is
well
to
notice
that
american
experience
proves
also
the
extreme
difficulty
of
finding
satisfactory
methods
of
control
sir
henry
tyler
said
some
years
ago
in
england
in
words
that
have
often
been
quoted
since
if
the
state
ca
control
the
railroads
the
railroads
will
control
the
state
and
president
roosevelt
has
again
and
again
in
the
last
few
years
insisted
on
the
same
point
the
american
people
he
said
in
effect
must
work
out
a
satisfactory
method
of
controlling
these
great
organizations
if
left
uncontrolled
there
will
be
such
abuses
and
such
consequent
popular
indignation
that
will
become
inevitable
and
is
alien
to
american
ideas
and
might
cause
very
serious
political
dangers
perhaps
some
of
my
hearers
may
remember
macaulay
graphic
description
of
the
passion
that
was
aroused
by
charles
james
fox
proposed
india
bill
it
was
described
as
a
bill
for
giving
in
perpetuity
to
the
whigs
whether
in
or
out
of
office
the
whole
patronage
of
the
indian
government
the
objection
felt
by
american
statesmen
to
handing
over
their
railroads
to
the
national
government
for
i
think
it
may
be
taken
for
granted
that
if
they
were
nationalized
it
would
have
to
be
wholly
under
federal
management
and
that
the
separate
states
could
take
no
part
in
the
matter
is
in
principle
the
same
there
are
something
like
a
million
and
a
half
men
employed
on
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
say
roughly
or
per
cent
of
the
voters
americans
feel
that
rival
political
parties
might
bid
against
each
other
for
the
support
of
so
vast
and
homogeneous
a
body
of
voters
that
the
amount
of
patronage
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
executive
government
for
the
time
being
would
be
enormous
and
that
the
general
interests
of
the
nation
might
be
sacrificed
by
politicians
anxious
to
placate
to
use
their
own
term
particular
local
and
sectional
interests
how
far
this
fear
which
is
undoubtedly
very
prevalent
in
the
states
is
justified
by
the
history
of
state
railroads
in
other
countries
is
a
question
exceedingly
difficult
to
answer
dealing
with
state
railroads
in
the
lump
it
is
easy
to
point
to
some
against
which
the
charge
would
be
conspicuously
untrue
to
take
the
most
important
state
railroad
organization
in
the
world
the
prussian
system
no
one
i
think
can
fairly
deny
that
it
has
been
operated
in
intention
at
least
if
not
always
in
result
for
the
greatest
good
of
the
greatest
number
but
then
prussia
is
prussia
with
a
government
in
effect
autocratic
with
a
civil
service
with
strong
de
and
permeated
with
old
traditions
leading
them
to
regard
themselves
as
the
servants
of
the
king
rather
than
as
candidates
for
popular
favor
an
american
statesman
charles
francis
adams
wrote
as
follows
more
than
years
ago
in
applying
results
drawn
from
the
experience
of
one
country
to
problems
which
present
themselves
in
another
the
difference
of
social
and
political
habit
and
education
should
ever
be
borne
in
mind
because
in
the
countries
of
continental
europe
the
state
can
and
does
hold
close
relations
amounting
even
to
ownership
with
the
railroads
it
does
not
follow
that
the
same
course
could
be
successfully
pursued
in
england
or
in
america
the
former
nations
are
by
political
habit
administrative
the
latter
are
parliamentary
in
other
words
france
and
germany
are
essentially
executive
in
their
governmental
systems
while
england
and
america
are
legislative
now
the
executive
may
design
construct
or
operate
a
railroad
the
legislative
never
can
a
country
therefore
with
a
weak
or
unstable
executive
or
a
crude
and
imperfect
civil
service
should
accept
with
caution
results
achieved
under
a
government
of
bureaus
nevertheless
though
conclusions
can
not
be
adopted
in
the
gross
there
may
be
in
them
much
good
food
for
reflection
control
by
democracy
or
ownership
by
autocracy
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
effect
of
the
evidence
is
that
the
further
a
government
departs
from
autocracy
and
develops
in
the
direction
of
democracy
the
less
successful
it
is
likely
to
be
in
the
direct
management
of
railroads
belgium
is
far
from
being
a
pure
democracy
but
compared
with
prussia
it
is
democratic
and
compared
with
prussia
its
railroad
management
is
certainly
inferior
popular
opinion
in
belgium
seems
at
present
to
be
exceedingly
hostile
to
the
railroad
administration
official
documents
assert
that
while
the
service
to
the
public
is
bad
the
staff
are
scandalously
underpaid
and
yet
that
the
railroads
are
actually
not
paying
their
way
there
was
it
is
true
till
recently
an
accumulated
surplus
of
profits
carried
in
the
railroad
accounts
but
the
official
figures
have
been
recently
revised
and
the
surplus
is
shown
to
be
the
swiss
experiment
is
too
new
to
justify
any
very
positive
conclusions
being
drawn
from
it
but
this
much
is
clear
the
state
has
had
to
pay
for
the
acquisition
of
the
private
lines
sums
very
much
larger
than
were
put
forward
in
the
original
estimate
the
surplus
profits
that
were
counted
on
have
not
been
obtained
in
practice
the
economies
that
were
expected
to
result
from
unification
have
not
been
realized
the
expenditure
for
salaries
and
wages
has
increased
very
largely
and
so
far
from
there
being
a
profit
to
the
federal
government
the
official
statement
of
the
railroad
administration
is
that
unless
the
utmost
care
is
exercised
in
the
future
the
railroad
receipts
will
not
cover
the
railroad
expenditure
the
italian
experiment
is
still
newer
it
would
not
be
fair
to
say
that
it
proves
anything
against
state
management
but
i
do
not
think
that
the
most
fervid
would
claim
that
either
on
the
ground
of
efficiency
or
on
the
ground
of
economy
it
has
so
far
furnished
any
argument
in
favor
of
that
policy
if
we
wish
to
study
the
state
management
of
railroads
by
pure
democracies
of
type
we
must
go
to
our
own
colonies
my
own
impressions
formed
after
considerable
study
of
the
subject
and
having
had
the
advantage
of
talking
with
not
a
few
of
the
men
who
have
made
the
history
i
hesitate
to
give
it
is
easy
to
find
partisan
statements
on
both
sides
for
example
in
a
recent
article
in
the
entitled
the
pure
politics
campaign
in
canada
i
find
the
following
quotation
from
the
a
paper
of
high
standing
dated
may
every
job
alleged
against
the
russian
autocracy
has
been
paralleled
in
kind
in
canada
first
there
is
the
awful
example
of
the
intercolonial
railway
probably
as
to
construction
the
most
costly
system
in
north
america
serving
a
good
country
with
little
or
no
competition
during
much
of
the
year
and
in
connection
with
much
of
its
length
no
competition
at
all
but
so
mishandled
that
one
of
its
managers
giving
up
his
job
in
disgust
said
it
was
run
like
a
comic
opera
some
years
it
does
not
earn
enough
to
pay
the
cost
of
operation
and
maintenance
i
may
interpolate
that
its
gross
earnings
per
mile
are
equal
to
those
of
an
average
united
states
railroad
and
every
year
it
needs
a
grant
of
one
two
three
or
four
million
dollars
out
of
the
treasury
to
keep
it
in
condition
to
do
at
a
loss
the
business
that
comes
to
it
when
land
is
to
be
bought
for
the
road
somebody
who
knows
what
is
intended
obtains
possession
of
it
and
turns
it
over
to
the
government
at
and
per
cent
advance
this
is
established
by
the
records
of
parliament
and
of
the
courts
of
the
land
african
cape
government
railroads
probably
no
one
outside
the
somewhat
heated
air
of
canadian
politics
is
likely
to
believe
this
damning
accusation
quite
implicitly
but
even
if
there
were
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
and
that
the
management
of
the
intercolonial
railway
is
for
whatever
cause
bad
appears
i
think
clearly
from
the
public
figures
it
is
bad
enough
that
such
charges
should
be
publicly
made
and
apparently
believed
let
me
quote
now
from
a
document
of
a
very
different
type
referring
to
a
colony
very
far
distant
from
canada
a
memorandum
relative
to
railroad
organization
prepared
at
the
request
of
the
railroad
commissioners
of
the
cape
government
railways
by
sir
thomas
price
formerly
general
manager
of
those
railroads
and
now
general
manager
of
the
central
south
africa
transvaal
and
orange
river
railways
dated
johannesburg
february
the
drawbacks
in
the
management
of
the
railroads
in
the
cape
that
call
for
removal
arise
from
the
extent
to
which
and
the
manner
in
which
the
authority
of
parliament
is
exercised
they
are
twofold
in
their
character
viz
the
practice
of
public
authorities
influential
persons
and
others
bent
on
securing
concessions
or
other
advantages
which
the
general
manager
has
either
refused
in
the
conscientious
exercise
of
his
functions
or
is
not
likely
to
grant
making
representation
to
the
commissioner
as
the
ministerial
head
of
the
government
supplemented
by
such
pressure
political
influence
or
other
means
as
are
considered
perfectly
legitimate
in
their
way
and
are
best
calculated
to
attain
the
end
applicants
have
in
view
many
members
of
parliament
act
similarly
in
the
interests
of
the
districts
constituents
or
railroad
employes
in
whom
they
happen
to
be
interested
it
is
by
no
means
unknown
for
the
requests
in
both
classes
of
cases
to
coincide
somewhat
with
a
critical
division
in
parliament
present
or
in
prospect
or
otherwise
something
has
occurred
which
is
regarded
as
irritating
to
the
public
or
embarrassing
to
the
government
and
the
desire
to
minimize
the
effect
by
some
conciliatory
act
is
not
unnatural
the
extent
to
which
the
fictitious
and
often
transitory
importance
which
a
community
or
district
manages
to
acquire
obscures
under
the
guise
of
the
colony
welfare
the
consideration
of
the
railroad
and
general
interest
in
the
colony
as
a
whole
during
the
earlier
period
of
my
railroad
service
in
the
cape
colony
few
things
impressed
me
more
coming
as
i
had
from
a
railroad
conducted
on
strictly
business
lines
than
the
extent
to
which
the
conduct
of
railroad
affairs
was
influenced
by
certain
conditions
nor
was
this
impression
lessened
afterwards
when
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
on
the
matter
sir
charles
elliott
mentioned
to
me
that
he
had
more
than
once
told
a
late
railway
commissioner
the
government
is
powerful
but
mentioning
the
town
and
authority
is
more
powerful
still
i
do
not
regard
it
as
open
to
doubt
that
the
colony
as
a
whole
has
suffered
severely
in
consequence
the
inland
portions
of
the
colony
particularly
so
and
that
the
need
for
a
remedy
is
pressing
if
the
railroads
are
to
be
conducted
as
a
business
concern
for
the
benefit
of
the
colony
the
necessity
for
the
railroads
and
their
administration
being
removed
from
such
an
atmosphere
and
treated
as
a
most
valuable
means
of
benefiting
the
colony
as
a
whole
while
not
neglecting
the
interests
of
a
district
but
not
subordinating
the
welfare
of
the
whole
colony
thereto
is
pressing
that
there
should
be
an
authority
to
refer
to
in
case
of
real
necessity
where
the
decision
or
action
of
the
general
manager
is
not
regarded
as
being
in
the
public
interests
is
also
clear
but
it
is
equally
manifest
that
the
commissioner
or
the
government
of
the
day
with
political
or
party
consideration
always
in
view
is
not
the
proper
court
of
reference
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
in
the
cape
colony
political
considerations
have
influenced
the
adoption
of
new
lines
and
their
construction
many
if
not
most
of
them
of
an
unprofitable
character
without
sufficient
inquiry
or
information
often
with
scanty
particulars
and
possibly
contrary
to
the
advice
of
the
officer
afterwards
entrusted
with
the
construction
and
working
of
the
line
a
material
change
is
imperatively
necessary
in
this
respect
if
only
to
insure
the
solvency
of
the
colony
victorian
australia
railroads
it
is
sometimes
conceded
that
improper
exercise
of
political
influence
may
be
a
real
danger
where
railroads
are
managed
under
a
parliamentary
by
a
minister
directly
responsible
to
parliament
but
that
difficulty
it
is
said
can
be
got
over
by
the
appointment
of
an
independent
commission
entirely
outside
the
political
arena
history
does
not
altogether
justify
the
contention
the
last
report
of
the
victorian
state
railways
gives
a
list
of
seven
branches
with
an
aggregate
length
of
miles
constructed
under
the
commissioner
at
a
cost
of
which
are
now
closed
for
traffic
and
abandoned
because
the
gross
receipts
failed
even
to
cover
the
working
expenses
it
is
not
alleged
nor
is
it
a
fact
that
those
lines
were
constructed
in
consequence
of
any
error
of
judgment
on
the
part
of
the
commissioners
but
in
truth
it
is
inherently
impossible
to
use
a
commission
to
protect
a
community
against
itself
in
theory
a
commission
might
be
a
despot
perfectly
benevolent
and
perfectly
intelligent
in
that
case
however
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
the
nation
manages
its
own
railroads
but
of
course
any
such
idea
is
practically
impossible
because
despots
however
benevolent
and
intelligent
can
not
be
made
to
fit
into
the
framework
of
an
constitution
in
practical
life
the
railway
commission
must
be
responsible
to
someone
and
that
someone
can
only
be
a
member
of
the
political
government
of
the
day
competition
has
ceased
to
regulate
i
have
indicated
what
in
america
where
the
subject
is
much
more
carefully
considered
than
here
is
regarded
as
a
great
obstacle
to
a
system
but
i
have
pointed
out
also
that
it
is
quite
possible
that
statesmen
fully
alive
to
the
dangers
may
yet
find
themselves
constrained
to
risk
them
unless
some
satisfactory
method
of
controlling
private
railroad
enterprise
can
be
found
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
considered
that
this
has
been
done
in
england
at
the
present
time
in
the
main
we
have
relied
on
the
force
of
competition
to
secure
for
us
reasonable
service
at
not
unreasonable
rates
and
as
i
still
cherish
a
belief
that
english
railroads
are
on
the
whole
among
the
best
if
not
actually
the
best
in
the
world
i
am
far
from
saying
that
competition
has
not
done
its
work
well
but
competition
is
an
instrument
that
is
at
this
moment
breaking
in
our
hands
within
quite
a
few
years
the
south
eastern
railway
was
united
with
the
chatham
the
great
southern
has
obtained
a
monopoly
over
a
large
part
of
ireland
in
scotland
the
caledonian
and
the
north
british
the
highland
and
the
great
north
have
in
very
great
measure
ceased
to
compete
if
the
present
proposals
for
the
working
union
of
the
great
eastern
the
great
northern
and
the
great
central
go
through
competition
in
the
east
of
england
will
be
absolutely
from
the
channel
to
the
tweed
and
one
can
hardly
suppose
that
matters
will
stop
there
in
fact
since
this
address
was
in
type
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
arrangement
for
a
long
term
of
years
between
the
london
north
western
and
the
midland
has
been
announced
we
must
i
think
assume
that
competition
which
has
done
good
work
for
the
public
in
its
day
is
practically
ceasing
to
have
any
real
operation
in
regulating
english
railroads
how
shall
government
regulate
for
regulation
therefore
we
must
fall
back
on
government
but
how
shall
a
government
exercise
its
functions
regulation
may
be
legislative
judicial
executive
or
as
usually
happens
in
practice
a
combination
of
all
three
but
we
may
notice
that
as
adams
points
out
in
countries
it
is
the
legislature
and
the
judicature
that
are
predominant
whereas
in
a
country
like
france
which
though
a
democracy
is
bureaucratically
organized
it
is
executive
regulation
that
is
most
important
now
the
capacity
of
the
legislature
to
regulate
is
strictly
limited
it
can
lay
down
general
rules
it
can
so
to
speak
provide
a
framework
but
it
can
not
decide
how
to
fit
into
that
framework
the
innumerable
questions
that
come
up
for
practical
decision
day
by
day
the
capacity
of
the
law
courts
to
regulate
is
even
more
strictly
limited
for
not
only
is
it
confined
within
the
precise
limits
of
the
jurisdiction
expressly
conferred
upon
it
by
the
legislature
but
further
by
the
necessity
of
the
case
a
court
of
law
can
only
decide
the
particular
case
brought
before
it
a
hundred
other
cases
equally
important
in
principle
and
perhaps
more
important
in
practice
may
never
be
brought
before
it
at
all
even
if
the
court
had
decided
all
the
principles
it
has
no
machinery
to
secure
their
application
to
any
other
case
than
the
one
particular
case
on
which
judgment
was
given
there
was
a
case
decided
years
ago
by
our
railroad
commission
the
principle
of
which
had
it
been
generally
applied
throughout
the
country
would
have
revolutionized
the
whole
carrying
business
of
great
britain
it
has
not
been
so
applied
to
the
great
advantage
in
my
judgment
of
english
trade
further
the
great
bulk
of
the
cases
which
make
up
the
practical
work
of
a
railroad
what
is
a
reasonable
rate
having
regard
to
all
the
circumstances
present
and
prospective
of
the
case
would
it
be
reasonable
to
run
a
new
train
or
to
take
off
an
old
one
would
it
be
reasonable
to
open
a
new
station
to
extend
the
area
of
free
cartage
and
the
like
all
these
are
questions
of
discretion
of
commercial
instinct
they
can
only
be
answered
with
a
probably
on
the
whole
not
with
a
categorical
yes
or
no
and
they
are
absolutely
unsuitable
for
determination
by
the
positive
methods
of
the
law
court
with
its
precisely
defined
issues
its
sworn
evidence
and
its
rigorous
exclusion
of
what
while
the
lawyer
describes
it
as
irrelevant
is
often
precisely
the
class
of
consideration
which
would
determine
one
way
or
other
the
decision
of
the
practical
man
of
business
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
both
in
england
and
in
america
we
must
expect
to
see
in
the
near
future
a
considerable
development
of
executive
government
control
over
railroads
this
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
in
detail
the
form
that
control
should
take
but
one
or
two
general
observations
seem
worth
making
the
leading
example
of
executive
control
is
france
in
that
country
the
system
is
worked
out
with
all
the
french
neatness
and
all
the
french
logic
but
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
the
french
principle
being
transplanted
here
for
one
thing
the
whole
french
railroad
finance
rests
upon
the
guarantee
of
the
government
the
french
government
pays
or
at
least
is
liable
to
pay
the
piper
and
has
therefore
the
right
to
call
the
tune
the
english
government
has
not
paid
and
does
not
propose
to
pay
and
its
claim
to
call
the
tune
is
therefore
much
less
morally
the
french
government
has
a
right
so
far
at
least
as
the
railroad
shareholders
are
concerned
to
call
on
a
french
company
to
carry
workmen
at
a
loss
morally
in
my
judgment
at
least
the
english
government
has
no
such
right
but
there
is
a
further
objection
to
the
french
system
the
officers
of
the
french
companies
have
on
their
own
responsibility
to
form
their
own
decisions
and
then
the
officers
of
the
french
government
have
also
on
their
own
responsibility
to
decide
whether
the
decision
of
the
company
officer
shall
be
allowed
to
take
effect
or
not
the
company
officer
has
the
most
knowledge
and
the
most
interest
in
deciding
rightly
but
the
government
official
has
the
supreme
power
the
system
has
worked
largely
i
think
because
the
principal
officers
of
the
companies
have
been
trained
as
government
servants
in
one
or
other
of
the
great
engineering
corps
des
mines
or
des
ponts
et
chaussées
but
it
is
vicious
in
principle
and
in
any
case
would
not
bear
transplanting
what
we
need
is
a
system
under
which
the
responsibility
rests
as
at
present
with
a
single
man
let
us
call
him
the
general
manager
and
he
does
what
he
on
the
whole
decides
to
be
best
subject
however
to
this
that
if
he
does
what
no
reasonable
man
could
do
or
refuses
to
do
what
any
reasonable
man
would
do
there
shall
be
a
power
behind
to
restrain
or
as
the
case
may
be
to
compel
him
and
that
power
may
i
think
safely
be
simply
the
minister
let
us
call
him
the
president
of
the
board
of
trade
for
be
it
observed
the
question
for
him
is
not
the
exceedingly
difficult
and
complicated
question
what
is
best
to
be
done
but
the
quite
simple
question
is
the
decision
come
to
which
i
am
asked
to
reverse
so
obviously
wrong
that
no
reasonable
man
could
honestly
make
it
and
even
this
comparatively
simple
question
the
president
would
not
be
expected
to
decide
unaided
he
will
need
competent
advisory
bodies
railroad
history
shows
two
such
bodies
that
have
been
eminently
successful
the
prussian
state
railway
councils
and
the
massachusetts
railroad
commission
wholly
unlike
in
most
respects
they
are
yet
alike
in
this
their
proceedings
are
public
their
conclusions
are
published
and
those
conclusions
have
no
mandatory
force
whatever
and
it
is
to
these
causes
that
in
my
judgment
their
success
which
is
undeniable
is
mainly
due
let
me
describe
both
bodies
a
little
more
at
length
there
are
in
prussia
a
number
about
ten
i
think
of
district
railway
councils
and
there
is
also
one
national
council
they
consist
of
a
certain
number
of
representative
traders
manufacturers
agriculturists
and
the
like
together
with
a
certain
number
of
government
nominees
and
the
railroad
officials
concerned
take
part
in
their
proceedings
but
without
votes
the
councils
meet
three
or
four
times
a
year
their
agenda
paper
is
prepared
and
circulated
in
advance
and
all
proposed
changes
of
general
interest
whether
in
rates
or
in
service
are
brought
before
them
from
the
railroad
side
or
the
public
side
as
the
case
may
be
the
decision
of
the
council
is
then
available
for
information
of
the
minister
and
his
subordinates
but
as
has
been
said
it
binds
nobody
the
massachusetts
railroad
commission
is
a
body
of
three
persons
usually
one
lawyer
one
engineer
and
one
man
of
business
appointed
for
a
term
of
years
by
the
governor
of
the
state
originally
the
powers
of
this
commission
were
confined
to
the
expression
of
opinion
if
a
trade
or
a
locality
or
indeed
a
single
individual
thought
he
was
being
treated
badly
by
a
massachusetts
railroad
he
could
complain
to
the
commission
his
complaint
was
heard
in
public
the
answer
of
the
railroad
company
was
made
there
and
then
and
thereupon
the
commissioners
expressed
their
reasoned
opinion
the
system
has
existed
now
for
more
than
years
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
with
negligible
exceptions
if
the
commission
expresses
the
opinion
that
the
railroad
is
in
the
right
the
applicant
accepts
it
if
the
commission
says
that
the
applicant
has
a
real
grievance
the
railroad
promptly
redresses
it
on
the
lines
which
the
commission
opinion
has
indicated
the
success
of
the
commission
in
gaining
the
confidence
of
both
sides
has
been
so
great
that
of
late
years
its
powers
have
been
extended
and
it
has
been
given
for
example
authority
to
control
the
issue
of
new
capital
and
the
construction
of
new
lines
but
on
the
question
with
which
we
are
specially
concerned
here
the
conduct
of
existing
railroad
companies
as
public
servants
it
can
still
do
nothing
but
express
an
opinion
and
it
may
be
added
that
the
commission
itself
has
more
than
once
objected
to
any
extension
of
that
power
adams
from
whom
i
have
already
quoted
was
the
first
chairman
of
the
commission
he
has
described
their
position
as
resting
on
the
one
great
social
feature
which
distinguishes
modern
civilization
from
any
other
of
which
we
have
a
record
the
eventual
supremacy
of
an
enlightened
public
opinion
that
public
opinion
is
supreme
in
this
country
few
would
be
found
to
deny
that
public
opinion
in
railroad
matters
is
enlightened
few
would
care
to
assert
but
given
the
enlightened
public
opinion
one
can
hardly
doubt
that
it
will
secure
not
merely
eventual
but
immediate
supremacy
in
truth
as
bagehot
once
pointed
out
a
great
company
is
of
necessity
timorous
in
confronting
public
opinion
it
is
so
large
that
it
must
have
many
enemies
and
its
business
is
so
extended
that
it
offers
innumerable
marks
to
shoot
at
it
is
much
more
likely
to
make
for
the
sake
of
peace
concessions
that
ought
not
to
be
made
than
it
is
to
resist
a
demand
that
reasonable
men
with
no
personal
interest
in
the
matter
publicly
declare
to
be
such
as
ought
rightly
to
be
conceded
to
sum
up
in
a
sentence
the
lesson
which
i
think
the
history
we
have
been
considering
conveys
it
is
this
closer
connection
than
has
hitherto
existed
between
the
state
and
its
railroads
has
got
to
come
both
in
this
country
and
in
the
united
states
hitherto
in
democracies
neither
state
ownership
nor
state
control
has
been
the
best
success
has
been
obtained
by
relying
for
control
not
on
the
constable
but
on
the
eventual
supremacy
of
an
enlightened
public
opinion
nearly
years
ago
in
the
pages
of
the
i
appealed
to
english
economists
to
give
us
a
serious
study
of
what
the
americans
call
the
transportation
problem
in
its
broad
economic
and
political
aspects
since
then
partisan
works
have
appeared
on
the
subject
not
one
of
them
in
my
judgment
worth
the
paper
on
which
it
is
printed
but
not
a
single
serious
work
by
a
trained
economist
and
yet
such
a
work
is
today
needed
more
than
ever
let
me
once
more
appeal
to
some
of
our
younger
men
to
come
forward
stop
the
gap
and
enlighten
public
opinion
footnote
i
further
it
is
common
knowledge
that
the
senate
only
passed
the
bill
and
that
by
a
majority
of
no
more
than
three
because
clemenceau
insisted
that
he
would
resign
if
it
was
not
passed
and
though
they
disliked
nationalization

they
disliked

railway
nationalization
by
sir
george
gibb
a
paper
read
at
a
meeting
of
the
royal
economic
society
on
november
railway
nationalization
has
for
many
years
occupied
the
minds
of
economic
and
political
students
and
the
practical
activities
of
statesmen
in
many
countries
and
in
english
colonies
it
has
been
regarded
here
as
a
remote
possibility
which
might
some
day
or
other
come
to
the
front
for
practical
discussion
but
quite
recently
it
would
have
been
thought
to
be
as
incredible
that
any
responsible
politicians
should
be
considering
proposals
for
purchasing
our
railways
for
the
state
as
that
any
substantial
number
of
persons
could
be
found
who
would
advocate
an
abandonment
of
the
fundamental
principle
that
there
should
be
no
taxation
of
imports
into
england
except
for
revenue
purposes
in
these
days
however
public
opinion
moves
suddenly
and
rapidly
the
despised
fallacy
of
yesterday
rises
as
the
creed
of
there
are
already
many
indications
that
before
long
there
will
be
a
numerous
and
influential
though
perhaps
a
somewhat
heterogeneous
party
who
will
urge
that
immediate
steps
should
be
taken
to
nationalize
our
railways
the
test
and
the
only
test
to
be
applied
to
proposals
for
railway
nationalization
is
whether
railways
owned
by
the
state
and
worked
directly
by
government
officials
would
be
better
and
more
efficient
than
railways
owned
and
worked
by
private
corporations
and
whether
after
taking
account
of
all
the
effects
of
the
change
upon
each
class
each
district
each
interest
the
net
result
would
increase
the
wealth
and
of
the
community
and
be
a
permanent
benefit
to
the
public
we
may
i
think
start
from
the
assumption
that
railway
proprietors
as
such
have
no
interest
in
opposing
nationalization
the
value
of
their
property
whether
measured
in
terms
of
capital
value
or
in
terms
of
future
income
estimated
on
a
fair
basis
would
it
is
assumed
be
fully
provided
for
in
the
gigantic
financial
operation
which
railway
purchase
would
involve
there
is
no
legal
flaw
in
the
title
of
railway
proprietors
they
enjoy
the
fundamental
rights
attached
by
our
law
to
absolute
property
subject
only
to
the
performance
of
obligations
definitely
prescribed
by
acts
of
parliament
i
think
therefore
that
we
may
discuss
this
subject
of
railway
nationalization
without
apprehension
that
the
change
if
it
were
adopted
by
the
deliberate
judgment
of
the
community
would
be
accompanied
by
anything
in
the
nature
of
confiscation
of
existing
rights
this
might
not
be
the
intention
or
the
wish
of
all
who
think
that
our
railways
should
be
nationalized
probably
some
extreme
socialists
would
like
to
transfer
railways
to
the
state
without
giving
what
in
our
judgment
would
be
adequate
compensation
to
existing
owners
their
aim
is
the
substitution
of
a
new
social
polity
for
that
which
exists
in
which
antiquated
ideas
of
private
property
would
have
no
place
but
that
is
only
a
phase
of
their
creed
which
condemns
it
to
sterility
it
is
not
the
small
band
of
socialist
zealots
but
the
majority
of
the
nation
that
we
have
to
consider
in
estimating
the
risk
of
anything
being
done
in
the
nature
of
confiscation
those
who
join
the
party
for
nationalizing
will
no
doubt
find
themselves
in
strange
company
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
movement
up
to
the
present
has
been
mainly
socialistic
a
trader
who
advocates
nationalization
because
he
hopes
that
he
might
be
able
to
transfer
to
somebody
else
perhaps
he
does
not
very
much
care
whom
some
part
of
the
burden
of
the
charges
which
he
has
to
pay
for
railway
carriage
will
find
that
his
next
neighbor
at
a
meeting
of
the
party
is
a
man
who
has
joined
for
quite
other
reasons
with
the
object
indeed
of
ultimately
seizing
for
the
state
some
part
of
his
neighbor
the
trader
property
which
the
latter
was
reckoning
to
increase
at
the
expense
of
amongst
others
his
neighbor
the
socialist
through
the
plan
of
railway
nationalization
but
the
homogeneity
of
the
party
need
not
concern
us
nor
the
question
whether
each
and
every
member
of
it
would
be
actuated
by
a
desire
for
the
public
good
the
forces
making
for
honesty
and
equity
in
the
treatment
of
existing
interests
would
i
think
so
overwhelmingly
outweigh
the
influences
tending
in
a
contrary
direction
that
we
need
not
complicate
the
question
by
importing
into
it
a
discussion
as
to
whether
adequate
compensation
should
or
would
be
paid
to
existing
owners
in
the
event
of
the
state
deciding
to
acquire
their
property
fair
and
adequate
compensation
for
existing
interests
may
be
taken
for
granted
but
although
compensation
can
be
paid
for
property
it
can
not
be
paid
to
the
general
community
who
would
suffer
in
the
event
of
the
administration
and
operation
of
railways
under
state
management
being
less
efficient
than
under
private
management
if
a
mistake
be
made
all
would
suffer
and
their
sufferings
would
not
and
could
not
be
mitigated
by
compensation
in
any
form
it
may
be
useful
at
the
outset
to
consider
what
has
led
to
the
question
of
railway
nationalization
in
this
country
being
discussed
the
origin
and
the
causes
of
those
movements
in
public
opinion
which
bring
about
great
constitutional
and
social
changes
are
frequently
most
difficult
to
trace
especially
by
contemporary
observers
for
a
full
understanding
of
such
movements
it
is
necessary
to
wait
for
the
historian
point
of
view
and
to
survey
a
wider
field
than
is
possible
whilst
the
events
are
occurring
when
much
of
the
material
for
final
judgment
as
to
the
causes
in
operation
is
concealed
in
an
undisclosed
future
that
there
is
a
movement
in
progress
tending
to
the
nationalization
of
railways
in
england
is
apparent
to
every
thoughtful
observer
of
the
times
but
whence
does
this
movement
come
and
what
are
its
principal
causes
we
are
able
to
identify
some
of
them
less
able
to
weigh
the
relative
importance
of
each
still
less
able
to
foretell
the
ultimate
share
which
each
will
have
on
the
future
course
of
development
which
will
depend
on
the
direction
taken
by
other
movements
in
public
opinion
which
at
the
moment
may
seem
to
be
entirely
independent
of
all
connection
with
the
particular
movement
we
are
considering
i
will
refer
to
a
few
of
the
causes
which
seem
to
me
to
be
most
prominently
at
work
but
i
will
not
attempt
to
state
them
in
the
order
of
their
importance
i
will
merely
enumerate
those
which
are
plainly
discernible
as
existing
in
some
shape
or
other
the
first
i
will
name
though
it
may
not
be
the
most
influential
is
the
existence
of
a
certain
amount
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
present
state
of
railway
administration
i
suppose
that
if
railway
services
were
as
good
as
possible
charges
as
cheap
as
possible
profits
as
high
as
possible
and
the
management
as
perfect
as
it
is
possible
for
railway
management
to
be
and
these
conditions
were
generally
admitted
to
exist
the
natural
instinct
to
leave
well
alone
would
prevent
any
proposal
for
nationalization
from
obtaining
a
hearing
it
must
be
conceded
that
there
is
a
certain
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
superficial
and
indefinite
though
it
be
to
which
advocates
of
nationalization
whose
schemes
originate
in
considerations
which
have
no
relation
either
to
the
excellence
or
to
the
imperfections
of
railway
arrangements
are
able
to
appeal
in
the
pursuit
of
their
aims
it
is
not
that
many
people
really
think
that
our
railways
do
not
as
a
whole
serve
the
public
well
whatever
individuals
may
say
in
moments
of
haste
hut
complaints
are
sufficiently
numerous
to
have
a
real
importance
as
an
influence
on
public
opinion
and
unfortunately
their
influence
is
to
a
large
extent
independent
of
their
justice
the
existence
of
criticism
which
after
all
is
only
another
name
for
difference
of
opinion
is
inevitable
and
probably
would
be
inevitable
under
the
most
perfect
system
of
railway
management
which
the
world
has
seen
or
ever
can
see
state
railways
would
not
be
immaculate
the
nature
of
railway
business
lays
it
open
to
an
exceptional
extent
to
the
unpopularity
which
unavoidably
gathers
round
every
institution
on
which
there
is
universal
dependence
providence
itself
does
not
wholly
escape
unpopularity
no
other
industry
is
comparable
with
the
railway
industry
in
the
close
dependence
upon
it
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
people
the
necessity
for
transport
services
penetrates
more
frequently
and
more
deeply
into
the
lives
and
habits
of
the
people
than
any
of
the
other
prime
necessities
of
civilization
the
need
for
transport
is
a
tyranny
all
tyrants
are
unpopular
and
the
tyranny
of
a
need
is
apt
to
beget
by
an
illogical
transposition
of
ideas
a
dislike
of
those
who
are
responsible
for
supplying
the
need
people
are
conscious
of
grievances
or
let
us
say
unsupplied
wants
they
can
not
measure
the
range
of
possibility
which
limits
the
supply
of
those
wants
or
remedies
for
those
grievances
they
constantly
wish
for
the
impossible
but
have
not
sufficient
knowledge
to
distinguish
between
the
possible
and
the
impossible
defects
which
can
not
be
remedied
are
generally
condemned
with
more
emphasis
than
those
which
are
due
to
mismanagement
it
is
irrelevant
to
consider
whether
the
dissatisfaction
to
which
i
have
referred
is
justified
or
not
whether
well
or
ill
founded
it
must
be
set
down
as
one
of
the
causes
of
the
movement
for
nationalization
the
second
cause
i
would
mention
is
a
belief
growing
from
a
suspicion
into
a
conviction
under
the
stimulus
of
repeated
failures
in
control
experiments
that
it
is
impossible
for
any
government
by
any
legislative
or
executive
action
in
any
form
to
exercise
useful
and
effective
control
over
railways
people
turn
in
despair
from
ideas
of
regulation
and
control
to
ideas
of
ownership
the
third
cause
is
the
prevalence
of
that
feeling
which
for
want
of
a
better
name
i
will
call
district
jealousy
the
competition
of
railways
undoubtedly
does
create
inequalities
it
would
be
mere
affectation
to
pretend
that
the
railway
accommodation
and
facilities
afforded
to
all
places
and
all
districts
are
equal
in
merit
and
value
the
less
favored
districts
see
other
districts
enjoying
superior
facilities
they
do
not
allow
for
differences
in
conditions
which
in
some
cases
explain
and
justify
the
differences
of
service
i
say
in
some
cases
because
it
would
be
impossible
to
deny
that
in
other
cases
the
comparative
inferiority
of
railway
facilities
can
not
be
explained
away
by
inevitable
determining
conditions
hence
district
jealousy
arises
and
a
desire
for
uniformity
such
uniformity
as
it
is
hoped
a
state
system
of
railways
would
give
the
fourth
cause
i
would
name
is
the
example
of
other
countries
this
is
affecting
men
judgments
with
great
force
we
are
slow
to
be
moved
by
foreign
example
but
there
is
an
increasing
tendency
to
submit
to
international
influences
and
foreign
example
in
this
matter
does
on
the
whole
point
to
national
railways
becoming
the
generally
accepted
system
the
fifth
cause
is
the
one
which
i
think
has
more
to
do
with
the
initiation
of
the
discussion
of
nationalization
schemes
than
any
other
cause
this
is
the
general
tendency
of
the
time
to
socialistic
experiments
if
there
were
no
socialists
and
no
socialism
in
the
thought
of
the
age
there
would
we
may
safely
conclude
be
no
talk
of
nationalization
of
railways
it
is
the
socialistic
propaganda
and
the
influence
which
that
propaganda
has
had
on
many
minds
which
more
than
anything
else
has
brought
the
question
of
the
nationalization
of
railways
within
the
range
of
practical
discussion
the
sixth
cause
is
the
anxious
search
for
more
revenue
for
the
state
national
expenditure
has
grown
to
such
enormous
and
alarming
dimensions
that
the
provision
of
revenue
to
meet
it
has
become
a
serious
and
urgent
difficulty
a
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
on
the
lookout
for
cash
has
not
been
able
to
resist
the
attraction
of
railways
as
a
source
of
revenue
for
the
state
he
has
noted
the
various
influences
at
work
which
are
tending
to
bring
the
question
of
railway
nationalization
to
the
front
has
looked
with
envy
at
the
large
revenue
which
prussian
railways
yield
to
the
state
and
has
at
least
gone
the
length
of
asking
himself
the
question
within
the
hearing
of
reporters
whether
he
ought
not
to
encourage
and
to
take
advantage
of
a
state
of
opinion
which
might
conceivably
be
worked
upon
so
as
to
create
a
majority
prepared
to
approve
the
principle
of
state
ownership
of
what
might
be
a
highly
lucrative
state
monopoly
the
mileage
of
railways
open
for
traffic
in
the
united
kingdom
at
the
end
of
each
of
the
last
four
decades
up
to
is
shown
in
the
following
table
mileage
open
increase
in
average
increase
year
for
traffic
ten
years
per
annum
the
growth
has
been
slow
and
decreases
with
each
decade
it
is
probably
true
that
the
period
of
construction
has
nearly
come
to
an
end
future
additions
to
the
mileage
are
not
likely
to
be
either
large
or
of
substantial
importance
this
rather
indicates
the
present
as
a
suitable
time
for
considering
a
change
of
system
the
considerations
which
are
applicable
to
what
i
may
call
the
age
of
construction
are
very
different
from
those
which
become
most
important
in
the
age
of
operation
it
would
probably
be
accepted
as
indisputable
that
in
a
country
like
england
where
capital
is
plentiful
and
enterprise
active
the
system
of
leaving
the
construction
of
railways
to
private
enterprise
is
the
best
system
whatever
may
be
thought
as
to
the
respective
merits
of
private
and
public
ownership
it
can
not
be
denied
that
private
enterprise
does
take
more
risk
than
any
government
is
likely
to
do
except
under
pressure
of
military
necessities
the
hope
of
gain
is
the
strongest
motive
for
enterprise
and
this
desire
operates
more
strongly
on
the
private
citizen
than
it
does
on
the
state
the
growth
of
railway
mileage
during
the
age
of
construction
in
any
country
is
promoted
by
the
constant
influence
and
moving
force
of
those
incentives
which
act
on
capitalists
the
spur
of
competition
is
always
in
active
operation
then
there
are
the
very
powerful
professional
influences
which
are
constantly
at
work
to
induce
capitalists
to
spend
their
money
on
works
and
enterprises
which
afford
professional
work
even
if
they
do
not
subsequently
provide
dividends
theoretically
no
doubt
railways
promoted
by
private
enterprise
tend
to
the
favoring
of
particular
localities
at
the
expense
of
other
localities
perhaps
it
is
right
that
the
stronger
should
grow
at
the
expense
of
the
weaker
but
at
all
events
it
is
inevitable
you
can
not
expect
private
competitors
to
think
of
anything
but
their
own
interests
and
if
this
be
so
you
can
not
expect
from
a
system
in
which
private
interests
predominate
the
same
consideration
of
general
design
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
interests
of
the
whole
country
as
from
a
system
which
places
public
in
front
of
private
interests
it
is
difficult
to
deny
that
the
miscellaneous
and
unequal
activities
of
private
enterprise
fail
in
the
absence
of
some
central
guidance
to
produce
the
best
results
so
far
as
harmony
and
completeness
of
design
are
concerned
in
england
railway
construction
has
not
been
as
in
america
almost
entirely
free
from
any
public
control
we
have
had
the
control
i
think
the
most
salutary
and
useful
control
of
parliament
so
far
as
it
has
gone
both
over
location
and
capitalization
but
it
has
not
gone
far
although
there
has
been
a
certain
amount
of
control
there
has
been
practically
no
guidance
the
control
under
the
system
of
private
bill
legislation
has
been
very
ineffectual
except
as
regards
capitalization
it
has
been
mainly
negative
never
constructive
all
that
parliament
could
practically
do
was
to
prohibit
the
making
of
particular
railways
which
aroused
opposition
from
some
landowning
or
railway
interests
powerful
enough
to
oppose
and
wealthy
enough
to
pay
the
heavy
costs
of
opposition
private
interests
have
been
protected
but
the
general
interest
has
in
the
main
been
ignored
but
whilst
conceding
that
it
would
have
been
a
great
advantage
if
the
vagaries
of
private
enterprise
had
been
more
restrained
by
some
prudent
general
guidance
i
think
that
the
chief
public
requirement
during
the
age
of
construction
is
that
as
much
mileage
as
possible
should
be
constructed
and
i
submit
as
a
true
conclusion
on
the
point
i
am
discussing
that
as
regards
the
age
of
construction
at
all
events
england
has
derived
incalculable
benefit
from
the
fact
that
the
railway
system
has
been
made
by
private
enterprise
but
the
problem
of
working
the
railway
system
after
it
has
been
constructed
is
i
admit
essentially
different
from
the
problem
of
securing
its
construction
my
subject
is
not
one
which
admits
of
discussion
except
on
very
general
lines
our
views
on
it
must
necessarily
be
formed
under
the
influence
of
the
opinions
we
hold
as
to
the
legitimate
functions
of
the
state
it
has
been
truly
said
that
no
country
has
ever
adopted
state
ownership
of
railways
from
theoretical
considerations
in
each
and
every
instance
there
were
some
practical
reasons
based
on
military
necessities
or
concrete
and
pressing
economic
conditions
to
meet
which
state
ownership
was
accepted
not
as
a
system
desirable
in
itself
but
as
an
expedient
which
in
the
circumstances
was
considered
to
be
the
best
practical
solution
of
difficulties
which
stood
in
the
way
of
the
satisfactory
development
of
railways
but
whilst
agreeing
with
this
as
a
true
historical
statement
i
doubt
whether
theory
can
be
entirely
excluded
from
a
statement
of
the
genesis
of
national
railway
systems
in
a
country
where
individualist
opinions
prevail
as
i
think
at
the
present
time
they
do
in
england
no
temptations
no
pressure
of
circumstances
short
of
extreme
national
emergency
would
induce
people
to
face
the
evils
which
the
individualist
knows
must
result
from
the
intrusion
of
state
action
into
matters
of
trade
this
is
theory
although
those
who
are
influenced
by
it
may
think
that
it
is
founded
on
practical
experience
on
the
other
hand
those
persons
who
wish
to
secure
trading
profits
for
the
state
even
at
the
cost
of
taking
commercial
risks
or
who
when
difficulties
and
obstacles
arise
in
commercial
development
resort
to
the
powers
of
the
state
to
overcome
them
either
by
the
imposition
of
taxes
on
the
general
community
in
the
interests
of
a
class
or
by
handing
over
to
state
officials
the
direction
of
an
industry
instead
of
relying
on
the
skill
enterprise
energy
and
character
of
the
people
are
socialists
at
heart
whether
they
know
it
or
not
and
are
actuated
by
the
radical
theory
of
a
creed
which
perhaps
most
of
them
would
disavow
but
after
all
the
question
is
not
whether
state
purchase
would
be
a
step
in
the
socialist
direction
but
whether
it
would
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
why
should
we
change
are
we
suffering
from
intolerable
evils
from
which
there
is
no
other
way
of
escape
or
is
there
some
great
national
benefit
to
be
derived
from
the
change
the
general
case
for
nationalization
as
put
forward
by
its
advocates
rests
on
very
few
arguments
and
it
is
not
i
think
unfair
to
describe
these
as
being
mainly
assumptions
the
accuracy
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
verify
i
may
summarize
a
few
of
these
government
management
would
be
more
efficient
and
less
costly
than
private
management
government
management
would
primarily
regard
the
interests
of
the
community
and
of
the
country
as
a
whole
and
the
substitution
of
that
condition
for
the
existing
system
under
which
the
interests
of
private
trading
concerns
take
first
place
in
the
thoughts
and
efforts
of
those
responsible
for
management
would
have
the
effect
of
securing
a
more
equal
and
more
satisfactory
development
of
the
resources
of
the
country
and
as
one
writer
expresses
it
with
more
than
the
usual
proportion
of
assumption
in
his
statement
trade
would
be
stimulated
under
equitable
reasonable
and
uniform
systems
of
rates
the
change
would
result
in
the
removal
of
most
of
the
serious
complaints
made
against
the
existing
administration
of
railways
those
who
refuse
to
look
upon
the
matter
as
mainly
a
commercial
problem
think
and
hope
that
new
means
would
be
found
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
social
needs
of
the
nation
if
the
railways
were
at
the
disposal
of
the
government
experience
of
the
economy
resulting
from
large
combinations
in
other
industries
is
invoked
in
support
of
the
proposal
to
get
rid
of
the
separate
administrations
of
private
railways
it
is
said
that
the
advantage
of
production
on
the
largest
scale
by
a
single
corporation
in
place
of
production
by
a
number
of
smaller
units
is
being
verified
by
the
experience
of
nearly
every
important
trade
and
industry
the
principle
has
been
recognized
in
the
history
of
railway
development
in
this
country
by
the
amalgamation
of
large
numbers
of
small
railways
into
the
great
railway
systems
which
we
now
see
and
it
is
argued
that
a
further
step
should
now
be
taken
in
the
same
direction
but
a
step
involving
the
creation
of
so
great
a
monopoly
as
further
large
amalgamations
would
involve
can
only
it
is
thought
be
taken
by
the
state
in
this
country
the
largest
railway
system
under
one
management
is
no
greater
than
about
miles
in
length
whereas
in
the
united
states
of
america
railway
systems
covering
about
miles
are
now
under
the
control
of
a
single
president
and
a
board
of
directors
it
is
said
therefore
that
modern
methods
of
administration
have
made
it
feasible
to
direct
the
miles
of
railway
in
the
united
kingdom
efficiently
and
successfully
by
means
of
one
comprehensive
organization
and
probably
if
there
is
to
be
one
organization
there
would
be
no
difference
of
opinion
that
the
single
organization
to
own
control
and
manage
the
railways
must
be
the
state
most
of
the
principal
objections
are
i
think
covered
by
the
following
list
state
management
would
be
less
efficient
than
management
under
private
enterprise
the
extension
of
government
patronage
by
placing
at
the
disposal
of
government
such
a
vast
number
of
appointments
to
lucrative
offices
the
risk
of
political
corruption
not
only
in
connection
with
the
exercise
of
patronage
but
also
in
ordinary
administration
in
the
settlement
of
questions
relating
to
charges
wages
and
services
the
danger
that
interested
parties
would
by
political
pressure
compel
the
state
to
expend
public
money
on
unremunerative
lines
and
unremunerative
services
the
contraction
of
the
available
field
for
private
enterprise
and
hence
the
weakening
of
the
foundation
of
all
individual
and
national
progress
the
introduction
of
serious
dangers
in
connection
with
labor
disputes
between
the
government
and
the
large
body
of
railway
servants
the
subject
has
not
been
sufficiently
long
under
public
discussion
to
make
it
easy
to
state
fully
the
hopes
of
its
supporters
and
the
fears
of
its
opponents
probably
both
are
exaggerated
if
one
examines
the
complaints
made
against
the
existing
railway
system
it
is
obvious
that
many
of
these
must
exist
under
any
system
whilst
some
are
the
necessary
accompaniments
of
every
system
into
which
competition
enters
but
if
competition
is
discarded
in
favor
of
monopoly
it
does
not
need
argument
to
show
that
this
merely
means
a
change
from
the
evils
of
competition
to
the
evils
of
monopoly
no
one
would
deny
that
each
system
contains
inherent
and
characteristic
evils
the
evil
of
competition
is
waste
the
evils
of
monopoly
are
stagnation
and
the
restriction
of
freedom
hitherto
for
the
regulation
of
railways
reliance
has
been
placed
on
two
factors
competition
and
control
parliamentary
action
and
public
opinion
have
veered
about
from
one
to
the
other
and
the
absence
of
clear
principle
in
the
policy
of
the
legislature
has
introduced
evils
which
a
more
logical
and
consistent
adherence
either
to
the
policy
of
free
competition
on
the
one
hand
or
to
the
policy
of
strict
control
on
the
other
would
have
avoided
that
some
regulation
is
necessary
all
would
admit
railways
sell
transportation
as
a
commodity
but
the
nature
of
the
business
makes
it
impossible
to
secure
the
conditions
of
absolutely
free
competition
as
in
the
case
of
other
industries
hence
the
necessity
for
control
but
every
plan
of
control
that
has
been
tried
has
proved
practically
inoperative
and
ineffective
mainly
because
it
has
endeavored
to
leave
competition
in
operation
and
it
is
the
evils
which
necessarily
arise
from
competition
which
lead
to
most
of
the
complaints
against
railways
the
inevitable
weakness
of
the
dual
system
of
competition
and
control
is
that
control
checks
competition
just
where
it
would
be
useful
in
the
public
interest
and
competition
nullifies
control
just
where
it
could
be
advantageously
applied
under
no
system
could
we
expect
railways
to
be
free
from
complaints
they
arise
equally
from
the
nature
of
the
business
and
the
nature
of
the
customers
but
with
a
view
to
seeing
whether
state
ownership
would
remedy
the
complaints
that
exist
let
us
try
to
understand
as
clearly
as
possible
what
the
complaints
are
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
speaking
to
a
deputation
of
traders
in
when
he
was
president
of
the
board
of
trade
said
that
he
was
impressed
with
the
great
and
growing
discontent
with
the
whole
system
now
what
are
the
causes
of
the
present
discontent
is
it
great
is
it
growing
these
are
questions
very
difficult
to
answer
but
there
are
some
useful
data
available
for
the
answer
the
way
has
been
made
plain
and
easy
for
complainants
against
railways
every
encouragement
and
every
facility
has
been
afforded
to
them
a
special
court
has
been
created
the
railway
and
canal
commission
the
constitution
of
which
was
carefully
framed
so
as
to
encourage
anyone
with
a
grievance
against
railways
to
hope
that
he
would
get
a
sympathetic
hearing
of
his
case
the
applications
to
that
court
were
so
few
that
those
people
who
can
not
bring
themselves
to
believe
that
the
number
of
real
as
distinct
from
imaginary
grievances
against
railways
are
remarkably
few
said
that
the
public
were
deterred
from
bringing
complaints
forward
by
the
expense
of
litigation
before
the
railway
commissioners
so
to
render
the
path
of
the
complainant
still
easier
a
procedure
was
introduced
which
is
unique
for
simplicity
and
cheapness
all
without
distinction
who
had
any
complaint
or
grievance
of
any
sort
or
kind
against
any
railway
or
canal
company
were
invited
to
come
and
lay
the
same
before
a
department
of
government
the
board
of
trade
who
practically
promised
to
use
their
influence
to
secure
an
amicable
adjustment
of
any
differences
this
procedure
is
so
simple
so
sweeping
so
so
encouraging
to
complainants
and
has
on
the
whole
been
exercised
by
the
board
of
trade
with
so
much
tact
and
success
that
its
records
should
supply
the
information
we
are
seeking
in
view
of
these
efforts
to
get
every
aggrieved
or
discontented
person
to
come
forward
and
disclose
his
complaint
is
it
possible
to
imagine
that
there
are
now
any
concealed
complaints
it
is
often
said
that
traders
will
not
complain
that
they
are
afraid
of
rousing
the
hostility
of
those
terrible
tyrants
the
railways
whose
power
in
england
at
any
rate
whatever
it
may
be
in
america
is
ludicrously
exaggerated
it
is
true
that
a
sensible
trader
who
has
a
fair
case
does
not
fly
with
it
to
the
board
of
trade
he
submits
it
to
the
railway
officers
in
the
ordinary
daily
course
of
business
and
almost
invariably
gets
the
matter
adjusted
but
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
trader
who
would
be
deterred
from
submitting
a
complaint
to
the
board
of
trade
by
any
feeling
of
fear
on
the
contrary
traders
in
these
days
suffer
from
an
excess
of
boldness
if
a
trader
is
dissatisfied
with
any
railway
charge
he
simply
refuses
to
pay
and
only
those
who
have
experience
of
the
daily
conduct
of
railway
business
can
know
how
common
and
unfortunately
how
effective
this
remedy
is
the
board
of
trade
make
an
annual
report
to
parliament
of
all
complaints
made
to
them
under
their
conciliation
jurisdiction
and
i
think
the
contents
of
these
reports
may
fairly
be
relied
on
as
presenting
a
complete
view
of
the
kind
of
complaints
that
exist
against
railways
a
useful
table
is
given
in
the
tenth
report
of
the
board
of
trade
issued
in
july
last
showing
the
total
number
of
complaints
for
ten
years
classified
according
to
their
nature
as
follows
no
per
total
annum
rates
unreasonable
or
excessive
in
themselves
or
which
were
unreasonably
increased
undue
preference
sundry
complaints
of
the
total
number
were
complaints
against
canal
companies
but
these
are
not
separated
in
the
classification
surely
the
above
is
a
remarkable
table
considering
the
vast
aggregate
of
business
and
the
facilities
offered
for
complaints
only
complaints
against
railways
or
an
average
of
about
per
annum
have
been
found
to
exist
then
look
at
the
results
of
these
complaints
these
are
given
in
another
table
and
only
complaints
or
an
average
of
per
annum
are
entered
as
resulting
in
the
complainants
finally
expressing
themselves
as
dissatisfied
services
for
which
the
aggregate
payment
amounts
to
millions
sterling
per
annum
are
rendered
and
yet
there
are
only
an
average
of
cases
per
annum
of
dissatisfied
complainants
to
the
most
open
most
favorable
and
least
costly
tribunal
in
the
world
for
hearing
complaints
against
railways
now
let
us
look
at
the
nature
of
the
complaints
made
would
state
ownership
remedy
any
of
these
complaints
i
set
aside
the
cases
of
miscellaneous
complaints
about
delay
in
transit
and
other
minor
matters
because
it
is
obvious
that
complaints
about
such
matters
would
not
disappear
under
any
conceivable
system
of
railway
management
practically
all
other
complaints
group
themselves
under
two
heads
excessive
rates
undue
preference
the
complaint
that
railway
rates
are
excessive
generally
takes
the
shape
of
a
comparison
of
the
charges
on
some
foreign
railway
now
i
confess
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
meet
such
allegations
because
of
the
difficulty
of
presenting
all
the
conditions
of
which
account
must
be
taken
in
order
to
make
a
fair
and
sound
comparison
and
also
owing
to
the
absence
of
adequate
data
or
materials
in
the
published
statistics
of
english
railways
a
general
allegation
that
english
rates
are
higher
than
those
charged
in
some
countries
can
not
even
be
discussed
because
the
factors
needed
for
the
comparison
are
not
available
are
they
in
fact
higher
is
a
question
the
answer
to
which
must
precede
discussion
as
to
reasons
and
explanations
the
facts
in
regard
to
the
average
length
of
haul
the
average
rate
per
ton
mile
for
different
kinds
of
traffic
or
the
average
charge
per
passenger
mile
and
general
information
as
to
the
nature
of
commodities
carried
speed
of
transit
and
services
rendered
for
the
rates
charged
must
be
ascertained
before
any
comparison
is
possible
and
these
facts
are
not
ascertainable
for
english
railways
my
belief
is
that
having
regard
to
the
capital
expended
on
construction
of
railways
english
railway
rates
are
not
excessive
for
the
services
rendered
and
i
greatly
doubt
whether
after
making
proper
allowances
for
differences
in
capital
cost
of
railway
accommodation
and
for
other
essentially
different
conditions
rates
in
any
country
are
lower
comparing
like
with
like
than
railway
rates
in
england
this
is
an
issue
of
fact
it
lies
at
the
threshold
of
any
inquiry
into
the
subject
of
railway
rates
and
i
confess
i
do
not
see
how
much
progress
can
be
made
with
any
discussion
which
turns
on
assertions
as
to
the
relative
dearness
of
english
railway
rates
until
adequate
materials
are
available
for
a
sound
comparison
it
is
true
beyond
question
that
english
railways
have
cost
more
to
construct
than
the
railways
of
any
other
country
the
capital
expenditure
of
all
railways
in
england
is
represented
by
the
figure
of
about
per
mile
as
compared
with
about
which
is
the
corresponding
figure
for
german
railways
and
about
per
mile
for
american
railways
railway
proprietors
in
england
are
not
responsible
for
the
high
capital
cost
they
were
forced
by
law
and
by
custom
powerful
as
law
to
pay
monstrously
inflated
values
for
their
lands
burden
upon
burden
has
been
heaped
upon
them
by
the
action
of
the
legislature
by
the
requirements
of
government
departments
and
by
the
exactions
of
public
opinion
they
have
borne
heavy
losses
in
being
compelled
to
spend
capital
without
regard
to
their
ability
to
secure
adequate
return
upon
it
and
assuredly
no
reckoning
is
due
from
them
to
the
public
in
this
matter
the
reverse
would
be
more
true
the
total
capitalization
of
railways
in
the
united
kingdom
in
the
year
as
given
in
the
board
of
trade
returns
was
millions
sterling
of
which
millions
represents
nominal
additions
the
net
earnings
some
of
which
however
arose
from
miscellaneous
sources
independent
of
the
operation
of
the
railways
amounted
to
or
per
cent
on
the
nominal
capital
out
of
a
total
of
millions
sterling
millions
of
loan
and
preferential
capital
received
interest
or
dividends
in
excess
of
per
cent
this
presumably
arose
from
the
insecurity
of
capital
involving
the
payment
of
a
high
rate
of
interest
or
dividend
one
hundred
and
millions
of
ordinary
capital
received
dividends
in
excess
of
per
cent
per
annum
the
capital
receiving
interest
or
dividends
in
excess
of
per
cent
per
annum
is
therefore
millions
or
per
cent
of
the
total
it
can
not
be
said
on
these
figures
that
the
interest
received
by
those
who
provided
the
capital
for
the
railways
is
excessive
but
would
it
be
possible
for
state
railways
to
reduce
the
amount
included
in
railway
rates
for
interest
and
dividends
it
can
not
be
denied
that
our
present
system
does
involve
the
needless
duplication
of
railway
accommodation
the
inevitable
waste
of
competition
there
is
the
constant
endeavor
to
divert
traffic
the
corresponding
effort
to
keep
it
capital
is
wasted
but
public
facilities
are
increased
the
public
could
certainly
secure
by
monopoly
the
saving
of
waste
but
only
at
the
cost
of
losing
the
advantages
such
as
they
are
of
getting
more
than
they
pay
for
i
suspect
that
on
a
broad
and
comprehensive
view
these
advantages
are
not
worth
to
the
community
the
waste
of
capital
involved
in
providing
them
but
it
is
rather
late
in
the
day
to
adopt
this
view
enormous
waste
has
already
been
incurred
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
drain
on
the
resources
of
the
nation
is
not
likely
to
be
so
serious
in
the
future
as
it
has
been
in
the
past
even
if
the
system
of
leaving
railways
to
private
enterprise
is
not
abandoned
the
private
ownership
of
railways
provides
for
the
absorption
of
the
wastage
of
capital
in
a
manner
which
would
be
impossible
under
state
ownership
millions
of
the
capital
expenditure
on
railways
goes
without
dividend
and
millions
has
to
be
content
with
a
return
less
than
per
cent
per
annum
although
this
undoubtedly
represents
a
loss
to
the
community
the
loss
is
distributed
it
falls
on
those
who
voluntarily
spent
their
money
in
the
hope
of
gain
and
lost
it
the
state
can
not
lose
capital
in
this
way
all
expenditure
incurred
by
the
state
would
be
represented
by
money
borrowed
on
the
public
credit
and
the
interest
would
have
to
be
paid
in
full
whether
the
expenditure
proved
remunerative
or
the
reverse
that
there
would
be
savings
and
large
savings
under
state
management
i
would
not
deny
but
that
is
because
the
railways
would
be
worked
as
a
monopoly
and
not
because
they
would
be
worked
by
the
state
the
same
and
still
larger
economies
in
working
could
be
effected
under
private
enterprise
if
competition
were
abandoned
in
favor
of
universal
combination
or
monopoly
the
whole
question
depends
on
the
waste
of
competition
each
railway
company
works
for
its
own
route
the
result
is
that
unnecessary
train
mileage
is
run
and
train
loads
are
lessened
the
secret
of
success
the
foundation
of
all
economy
in
railway
working
lies
in
securing
the
largest
possible
train
loads
this
is
a
simple
rule
but
it
embodies
a
universal
truth
if
those
responsible
for
the
handling
and
carriage
of
railway
traffic
could
work
with
a
single
eye
to
economical
results
and
in
all
cases
forward
traffic
by
the
routes
which
yielded
the
best
working
results
great
economies
could
undoubtedly
be
effected
this
consideration
does
indicate
that
a
source
of
improvements
in
railway
results
would
be
open
to
a
railway
system
under
government
management
which
is
not
available
for
privately
owned
railways
competing
with
one
another
and
in
fairness
one
must
admit
that
this
source
of
economy
obtainable
only
under
the
conditions
of
monopoly
must
be
set
down
as
a
point
to
the
credit
of
state
ownership
many
of
the
complaints
against
railway
rates
as
excessive
are
really
when
analyzed
complaints
of
undue
preference
they
are
based
on
comparisons
with
other
rates
and
in
nearly
every
case
it
is
the
factor
of
competition
which
lies
at
the
root
of
the
difficulty
this
is
the
natural
result
of
our
mixed
system
of
competition
and
control
in
principle
all
would
admit
that
there
should
be
equal
treatment
on
railways
but
what
is
and
what
ought
to
be
equality
are
questions
in
regard
to
which
there
is
much
room
for
difference
of
opinion
to
what
extent
does
the
law
really
require
equality
the
railway
and
canal
traffic
act
enacts
in
substance
that
a
railway
company
shall
not
make
any
difference
in
the
treatment
of
traders
which
shall
amount
to
an
undue
preference
it
permits
the
grouping
of
places
situated
at
various
places
from
any
point
of
destination
or
departure
of
merchandise
provided
that
the
distances
shall
not
be
unreasonable
and
that
the
rates
charged
and
the
places
grouped
together
shall
not
be
so
grouped
as
to
create
an
undue
preference
now
in
this
legislation
there
is
no
definite
or
tangible
principle
the
legislature
has
not
really
made
up
its
mind
how
traders
should
be
treated
it
simply
says
that
any
preference
given
to
one
trader
over
another
shall
not
be
undue
but
the
interpretation
of
the
word
undue
is
left
open
the
prohibition
of
undue
preference
only
applies
to
the
actions
of
one
company
on
its
own
railway
and
therefore
covers
but
a
small
part
of
the
matter
a
trader
desiring
to
have
his
goods
sent
to
some
market
which
is
prejudiced
by
the
competition
of
goods
carried
to
the
same
market
from
some
other
place
by
some
other
railway
which
for
some
reason
or
other
good
or
bad
gives
better
treatment
to
its
customers
a
prejudice
far
more
likely
to
happen
in
fact
than
one
arising
from
differences
in
treatment
on
the
same
railway
is
not
protected
or
assisted
by
any
legislation
the
question
may
be
asked
whether
national
railways
would
or
could
cure
this
somewhat
indefinite
position
if
railways
were
nationalized
would
it
not
be
necessary
and
would
it
be
practicable
to
settle
the
principles
to
be
applied
in
treating
different
districts
in
competition
with
one
another
at
present
there
are
no
principles
if
the
districts
are
served
by
different
railways
if
one
railway
serves
two
districts
the
law
provides
that
such
railway
shall
not
mete
out
unequal
treatment
so
as
to
constitute
undue
preference
whatever
that
may
mean
but
if
these
two
competing
districts
are
served
by
different
railways
the
law
shrinks
from
any
interference
now
in
practically
every
case
the
favorable
treatment
complained
of
due
or
undue
as
the
case
may
be
is
forced
upon
the
railway
company
by
competition
in
some
shape
or
other
it
may
be
competition
of
other
carriers
by
sea
or
by
land
or
it
may
be
the
necessity
for
enabling
one
district
to
compete
with
another
less
favorably
situated
such
consideration
for
the
commercial
needs
of
districts
in
relatively
advantageous
positions
is
permitted
and
encouraged
when
it
is
afforded
by
different
railways
though
rendered
difficult
when
one
railway
serves
the
competing
districts
what
would
state
railways
do
if
the
law
of
undue
preference
now
operative
within
the
limits
of
particular
railway
systems
became
by
reason
of
state
ownership
applicable
to
all
railways
there
would
be
a
stupendous
disturbance
of
existing
trading
conditions
instead
of
state
purchase
diminishing
the
complaints
of
undue
preference
it
would
be
the
signal
for
the
commencement
of
fierce
conflicts
between
districts
it
would
be
necessary
to
face
the
question
whether
and
to
what
extent
geographical
advantage
of
position
should
be
recognized
in
fixing
railway
rates
the
centers
of
production
and
consumption
in
england
have
been
fixed
away
back
in
commercial
history
and
from
a
railway
point
of
view
these
have
largely
to
be
taken
as
facts
beyond
control
facilities
for
reaching
the
populous
centers
of
consumption
are
of
vital
importance
to
producers
and
importers
would
state
railways
be
compelled
by
the
pressure
of
interested
landowners
and
others
to
fix
rates
for
agricultural
produce
and
manufactured
articles
and
for
import
and
export
trade
rigidly
in
proportion
to
distance
it
is
probable
that
a
bitter
controversy
would
arise
on
the
question
and
discontent
with
the
railway
arrangements
which
have
gradually
and
with
very
general
approval
been
established
in
england
instead
of
being
lessened
would
be
greatly
extended
if
we
embarked
on
the
experiment
of
state
ownership
would
the
management
of
railways
by
government
officials
be
on
the
whole
better
than
management
by
the
officers
of
private
corporations
working
for
profit
that
is
the
question
which
lies
at
the
root
of
the
subject
which
we
are
discussing
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
have
no
inclination
to
jibe
at
the
management
of
those
enterprises
which
are
conducted
by
the
state
and
municipal
bodies
i
do
not
think
that
the
postal
services
would
be
better
managed
if
they
were
under
private
control
probably
not
so
well
municipal
tramways
show
the
weakness
of
public
management
chiefly
in
the
tendency
towards
fixing
charges
at
figures
which
sacrifice
the
interests
of
ratepayers
to
the
interests
of
the
working
classes
who
possess
votes
but
who
generally
occupy
houses
in
respect
of
which
they
do
not
directly
pay
rates
that
there
would
be
very
grave
risks
in
substituting
state
management
for
commercial
management
of
railways
must
i
think
be
generally
admitted
but
some
of
the
principal
arguments
against
municipal
trading
do
not
seem
to
me
to
apply
to
the
working
of
railways
by
the
state
of
course
the
objection
of
those
who
think
that
no
public
authority
should
become
directly
responsible
for
the
management
of
any
commercial
undertaking
is
as
valid
against
state
working
of
railways
as
against
municipal
working
of
tramways
or
municipal
supply
of
electricity
for
light
and
power
in
both
cases
there
is
a
restriction
of
the
field
of
private
enterprise
and
that
is
enough
for
the
individualist
he
is
convinced
on
general
grounds
that
all
commercial
undertakings
should
be
left
exclusively
to
private
enterprise
but
those
who
are
not
prepared
to
settle
such
matters
on
any
general
theory
and
who
prefer
to
weigh
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
in
each
case
see
that
many
of
the
reasons
against
municipal
trading
can
not
fairly
be
urged
against
the
national
ownership
of
railways
municipal
trading
is
indefensible
because
it
unfairly
competes
with
private
traders
competition
in
commerce
must
be
fair
competition
on
equal
terms
otherwise
it
fails
to
secure
any
of
the
economic
advantages
which
do
undoubtedly
flow
from
the
free
competition
of
private
traders
a
commercial
undertaking
must
be
worked
for
a
commercial
profit
a
municipality
raises
money
on
public
credit
and
thus
gains
an
advantage
over
every
private
competitor
it
also
fixes
scales
of
charges
and
rates
of
wages
without
reference
or
at
all
events
without
exclusive
reference
to
considerations
of
profit
and
thus
makes
it
impossible
for
any
competing
trader
to
earn
a
legitimate
commercial
profit
and
to
make
it
possible
to
do
this
it
uses
the
power
of
taxation
and
levies
rates
on
the
competing
traders
themselves
so
that
the
municipal
business
can
be
carried
on
without
the
commercial
profit
which
the
private
trader
must
earn
in
order
to
live
no
one
can
say
that
this
is
fair
competition
then
municipal
bodies
are
from
their
composition
unsuitable
for
carrying
on
commercial
business
their
organization
can
not
be
adapted
to
commercial
management
the
individuals
who
serve
on
these
bodies
have
neither
the
time
nor
as
a
collective
body
the
capacity
for
managing
the
business
on
which
they
embark
with
efficiency
and
success
the
difference
in
results
due
to
the
difference
between
good
and
bad
management
is
paid
for
out
of
the
rates
these
considerations
do
not
however
apply
with
equal
force
to
the
state
management
of
railways
the
state
would
have
a
complete
and
universal
monopoly
there
would
be
no
private
competition
left
except
of
course
competition
by
sea
or
by
tramway
or
any
other
mode
of
conveyance
which
can
compete
with
railways
then
there
would
not
be
it
may
be
assumed
any
body
like
a
municipal
council
who
would
practically
interfere
with
the
management
there
might
be
advisory
councils
like
the
prussian
state
railway
councils
and
of
course
there
would
be
a
minister
of
state
responsible
to
parliament
for
the
railway
administration
and
parliament
itself
already
one
may
remark
in
passing
clogged
and
overburdened
with
work
but
it
is
certain
that
whatever
the
details
of
the
organization
adopted
might
be
the
whole
of
the
management
would
practically
be
left
to
the
expert
permanent
officials
of
the
railways
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
railway
officers
would
serve
the
state
with
as
much
loyalty
and
with
as
great
a
measure
of
success
as
they
now
serve
the
proprietors
instead
of
being
responsible
to
boards
of
directors
and
shareholders
they
would
be
responsible
to
a
certain
number
of
officers
of
state
probably
indeed
necessarily
to
a
large
extent
recruited
from
their
own
ranks
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
change
would
result
in
much
practical
difference
so
far
as
the
work
of
those
who
really
carry
out
the
duties
of
management
are
concerned
the
only
difference
would
be
that
these
officers
would
have
in
view
that
they
were
working
for
the
state
instead
of
for
shareholders
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
if
railways
were
nationalized
they
would
be
used
as
a
field
for
many
kinds
of
social
experiments
the
combination
of
philanthropy
with
business
is
generally
regarded
with
suspicion
but
the
conversion
of
the
railway
manager
into
a
social
reformer
would
i
think
arouse
serious
and
legitimate
alarm
the
certainty
which
we
now
possess
that
the
action
of
any
railway
company
whether
it
be
wise
or
foolish
in
itself
is
wholly
commercial
in
its
motives
and
its
aims
is
a
valuable
safeguard
but
if
railway
policy
were
to
become
the
medium
for
the
promotion
of
social
or
even
economic
theories
under
the
guidance
of
politicians
would
not
this
be
a
most
alarming
peril
to
trading
and
industrial
interests
one
group
might
insist
by
political
pressure
that
the
standard
of
wages
should
be
maintained
at
a
higher
level
than
could
be
commercially
justified
another
group
or
many
groups
might
devote
their
efforts
to
securing
the
construction
of
railways
in
districts
which
could
not
support
them
with
sufficient
traffic
with
the
result
of
burdening
the
railway
system
with
many
unremunerative
branches
for
which
either
traders
passengers
or
the
taxpayers
throughout
the
country
would
have
to
pay
the
policy
of
others
would
be
to
make
suburban
railways
at
enormous
cost
and
run
cheap
trains
to
serve
the
population
resident
in
large
cities
regardless
whether
such
railways
or
trains
were
or
not
in
this
policy
they
would
have
the
ardent
and
influential
support
of
the
owners
of
suburban
land
who
would
rejoice
in
the
increase
of
their
rents
brought
about
by
the
expenditure
of
public
money
in
creating
railway
facilities
on
uncommercial
terms
these
are
not
fanciful
dangers
they
are
the
results
which
we
may
feel
sure
would
inevitably
follow
the
nationalization
of
our
railways
and
the
advantages
to
be
gained
from
state
management
would
need
to
be
very
great
to
compensate
for
these
burdens
another
aspect
of
the
question
which
requires
the
gravest
consideration
is
that
which
concerns
the
position
of
the
state
as
an
employer
of
labor
there
are
upwards
of
railway
officers
and
servants
the
state
would
become
the
direct
employer
of
that
huge
army
and
would
have
to
settle
all
questions
relating
to
hours
wages
and
other
conditions
of
service
if
a
railway
company
is
unable
to
settle
differences
with
its
men
the
ultimate
resort
of
the
men
is
the
withdrawal
of
their
labor
whilst
the
company
are
free
to
employ
other
men
who
are
willing
to
accept
their
conditions
of
employment
any
railway
strike
on
a
large
scale
is
a
dire
calamity
to
trade
and
to
the
public
but
if
one
were
compelled
to
consider
the
possibility
of
a
general
strike
on
a
national
railway
system
even
the
deplorable
results
which
accompany
strikes
on
railways
would
seem
comparatively
insignificant
probably
a
railway
department
of
government
would
not
urge
the
adoption
of
compulsory
arbitration
if
they
were
themselves
concerned
with
as
much
equanimity
as
they
do
in
the
case
of
strikes
on
private
railways
it
is
true
that
in
this
matter
the
advocates
of
state
railways
can
point
to
the
comparative
absence
of
labor
conflicts
in
connection
with
the
services
now
under
government
control
but
municipal
undertakings
have
not
been
so
successful
in
avoiding
labor
disputes
and
in
many
cases
have
secured
even
the
degree
of
immunity
from
such
conflicts
which
they
enjoy
by
the
concession
of
terms
of
employment
which
constitute
heavy
burdens
on
the
ratepayers
it
seems
to
me
that
the
danger
of
serious
labor
disputes
can
not
be
put
aside
and
i
confess
that
i
am
unable
to
see
any
safe
way
of
meeting
the
objection
to
state
ownership
on
the
ground
that
the
state
ought
to
limit
as
far
as
possible
its
liability
to
become
directly
concerned
in
such
disputes
in
conclusion
i
would
say
that
i
have
felt
unable
to
take
up
a
partisan
attitude
on
the
question
for
many
years
past
both
my
studies
on
railway
subjects
and
my
practical
experience
have
led
me
to
a
convinced
belief
in
the
advantages
of
monopoly
and
i
am
unable
wholly
to
disapprove
of
a
scheme
which
would
secure
for
the
country
the
advantages
of
a
system
of
monopoly
in
which
i
believe
even
although
it
should
come
in
the
guise
of
state
ownership
competition
in
my
judgment
creates
more
evils
than
it
cures
especially
the
and
imperfect
competition
which
exists
in
england
so
far
as
railways
are
concerned
which
can
not
be
regarded
as
free
competition
on
a
commercial
basis
i
recognize
that
it
is
impracticable
to
secure
unification
or
any
very
extensive
or
combinations
of
railways
under
our
system
of
private
ownership
the
public
would
not
tolerate
uncontrolled
railways
under
private
management
and
i
doubt
whether
any
form
of
control
which
has
yet
been
devised
or
is
likely
to
be
devised
combined
with
partial
competition
can
give
entirely
satisfactory
results
that
there
are
grave
dangers
and
risks
in
the
public
ownership
of
railways
i
fully
admit
indeed
so
grave
are
they
that
i
think
he
would
be
a
very
bold
minister
who
would
venture
to
bring
forward
under
government
sanction
a
proposal
for
the
nationalization
of
our
railways
the
existence
of
such
a
huge
amount
of
government
patronage
would
open
the
door
to
political
corruption
the
existence
of
such
an
enormous
body
of
government
servants
possessing
the
franchise
and
i
confess
it
seems
to
me
impracticable
to
hope
that
any
measure
could
be
carried
subject
to
disfranchisement
of
government
servants
would
imperil
the
financial
stability
of
the
railway
system
and
introduce
new
and
very
serious
sources
of
weakness
and
danger
into
the
body
politic
the
risk
of
loss
from
the
charging
of
unduly
low
rates
under
pressure
from
the
influential
body
of
traders
seeking
to
enrich
themselves
at
the
expense
of
the
general
community
seems
to
me
a
risk
which
no
thoughtful
man
can
ignore
no
expedients
for
checking
and
restraining
political
influence
so
that
it
could
not
reach
or
sway
the
decision
of
the
officers
of
state
responsible
for
railway
management
seem
to
me
practicable
under
our
democratic
constitution
if
the
nation
owns
the
railways
the
nation
must
take
all
the
risks
of
state
ownership
and
we
could
only
trust
that
the
existing
purity
of
our
politics
and
the
common
sense
honorable
character
and
long
experience
in
of
the
english
people
would
suffice
to
protect
the
commonwealth
from
these
perils
resulting
in
serious
harm
but
whatever
may
be
the
issue
of
the
consideration
of
the
question
of
state
purchase
of
railways
i
am
prepared
to
believe
that
english
railways
will
continue
whether
under
state
management
or
under
private
management
to
deserve
the
praise
which
acworth
expressed
in
his
recent
address
as
president
of
the
economic
section
of
the
british
association
in
dublin
by
saying
that
in
his
judgment
after
i
may
remind
you
a
fuller
study
of
railway
conditions
in
all
countries
of
the
world
than
has
been
given
to
the
subject
of
many
men
in
england
that
english
railways
are
on
the
whole
among
the
best
if
not
actually
the
best
in
the
world
concerning
advances
in
railway
rates

the
principle
upon

the
reasons
which
control
the
action

may
be
briefly
stated
as
follows
review
of
question
before
committee
from
congress
by
the
act
then
passed
to
regulate
commerce
through
all
of
its
amendments
to
that
act
including
the
act
of
june
which
was
passed
after
the
most
elaborate
investigation
of
the
entire
subject
and
the
fullest
debate
has
adhered
to
a
fixed
policy
in
its
legislation
upon
this
subject
it
has
declared
its
constitutional
right
to
regulate
the
transportation
of
persons
and
property
in
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
while
at
the
same
time
it
has
recognized
the
right
of
the
owners
of
the
instrumentalities
of
commerce
to
control
and
manage
their
properties
subject
to
the
supervision
and
limitation
imposed
by
the
regulating
statute
that
the
charges
fares
and
rates
must
be
fair
just
and
reasonable
that
neither
discrimination
as
to
person
or
place
must
be
found
in
the
schedules
and
that
no
device
of
any
character
should
result
in
unlawful
preference
between
shippers
it
has
in
all
these
acts
recognized
the
right
of
the
responsible
managers
of
the
transportation
interests
of
the
country
to
fix
the
rates
for
transportation
as
upon
its
revenue
must
rest
the
efficiency
of
its
service
to
the
public
and
the
value
of
its
property
to
its
holders
subject
only
to
those
wise
limitations
which
prohibit
the
exercise
of
these
property
rights
to
the
injury
of
the
public
congress
has
appreciated
the
magnitude
of
the
vast
interest
affected
by
such
legislation
with
miles
of
track
with
millions
of
rates
published
in
accordance
with
the
statute
with
changes
of
rates
numbering
between
and
a
day
and
reaching
the
enormous
sum
of
a
year
it
has
with
the
practical
experience
of
years
refused
to
take
the
initiation
of
rates
from
the

and
impose
it
upon
its
administrative
tribunal
congress
and
the
supreme
court
have
adopted
the
construction
of
the
act
to
regulate
commerce
announced
by
judge
jackson
interstate
commerce
commission
b
fed
and
affirmed
subject
to
the
two
leading
prohibitions
that
their
charges
shall
not
be
unjust
or
unreasonable
and
that
they
shall
not
unjustly
discriminate
so
as
to
give
undue
preference
or
disadvantage
to
persons
or
traffic
similarly
circumstanced
the
act
to
regulate
commerce
leaves
common
carriers
as
they
were
at
the
common
law
free
to
make
special
contracts
looking
to
the
increase
of
their
business
to
classify
their
traffic
to
adjust
and
apportion
their
rates
so
as
to
meet
the
necessities
of
commerce
same
principles
which
are
regarded
as
sound
and
adopted
in
other
trades
and
pursuits
this
policy
we
believe
has
been
approved
by
the
country
during
that
period
pending
the
elaborate
investigation
of
this
subject
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
act
of
june
no
crystallized
sentiment
was
manifested
either
in
the
press
or
during
the
hearings
that
indicated
a
public
sentiment
that
this
policy
should
be
departed
from
since
this
bill
has
been
before
your
committee
no
such
public
sentiment
has
been
shown
to
exist
by
those
who
appeared
before
it
the
conferring
upon
the
commission
the
power
to
suspend
a
rate
advanced
either
upon
the
filing
of
a
protest
by
a
shipper
or
in
the
discretion
of
the
commission
taken
in
connection
with
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
gives
to
the
commission
the
power
to
fix
a
rate
and
to
designate
the
time
not
longer
than
two
years
that
it
should
remain
in
force
would
ultimately
turn
over
to
that
administrative
body
the
function
of
initiating
the
rates
of
the
entire
country
it
would
offer
a
premium
to
every
shipper
to
enter
a
protest
to
the
advance
of
rates
whether
they
were
reasonable
or
unreasonable
even
if
discretion
was
vested
in
the
commission
the
protest
prepared
by
skilled
attorneys
presenting
a
prima
facie
case
of
unreasonable
advance
of
the
rate
with
no
opportunity
for
an
investigation
before
it
must
be
acted
upon
an
official
body
on
which
was
imposed
the
responsibility
to
act
would
be
constrained
to
suspend
the
rate
until
a
final
determination
of
the
complaint
the
existing
law
permits
any
shipper
to
protest
any
rate
that
has
gone
into
effect
the
hearing
on
the
protest
is
made
without
formal
pleadings
and
the
commission
is
authorized
then
to
determine
the
question
whether
the
rate
put
in
effect
by
the
carrier
was
a
reasonable
rate
or
not
and
if
not
to
make
the
rate
reasonable
so
far
in
the
practical
operation
of
the
act
of
june
this
provision
of
law
has
worked
satisfactorily
and
but
comparatively
few
of
the
decisions
of
the
commission
have
been
contested
by
the
carriers
under
existing
law
both
parties
are
protected
if
the
decision
is
that
the
rate
is
unreasonable
a
judgment
may
be
rendered
in
favor
of
the
protestant
for
the
difference
between
what
the
commissioners
determine
is
a
reasonable
rate
and
the
rate
fixed
by
the
carrier
with
per
cent
interest
from
the
date
of
the
overcharge
if
on
the
other
hand
this
amendment
should
receive
the
approval
of
congress
and
the
rate
filed
by
the
carrier
should
be
protested
and
then
suspended
by
the
commission
in
the
multiplicity
of
duties
imposed
upon
that
tribunal
considerable
time
would
elapse
before
a
final
determination
of
the
question
could
be
reached
during
that
period
the
carrier
would
be
receiving
only
the
old
rate
and
if
the
commission
finally
decided
that
the
advance
was
reasonable
no
reparation
in
any
way
could
be
awarded
it
was
alleged
before
the
committee
that
this
last
result
would
not
be
very
injurious
to
the
carrier
for
the
reason
that
it
would
be
receiving
the
rate
which
it
had
fixed
as
a
fair
compensation
for
the
service
performed
prior
to
the
change
the
answer
to
this
seems
reasonable
which
was
that
conditions
had
so
changed
that
it
required
an
advance
of
the
rate
to
meet
those
new
conditions
otherwise
the
advanced
rate
would
have
no
justification
that
traffic
officials
fully
appreciate
the
fact
that
with
the
watchful
eyes
of
every
shipper
affected
by
an
advanced
rate
and
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
determine
and
fix
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
as
a
general
rule
rates
would
not
be
advanced
by
such
officials
without
a
belief
upon
their
part
that
there
were
sufficient
reasons
to
sustain
them
if
protested
the
attention
of
the
committee
has
been
called
to
the
attitude
of
the
commission
in
its
rulings
upon
the
advance
of
rates
even
where
the
facts
have
shown
that
the
rates
have
been
lowered
with
a
view
of
developing
a
particular
industry
in
the
case
of
the
new
albany
furniture
company
against
mobile
jackson
and
kansas
city
railroad
company
decided
june
the
commission
held
the
rates
were
low
before
the
increase
but
having
been
established
after
prolonged
negotiations
especially
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
complainant
to
reach
a
particular
market
and
in
preference
to
making
a
readjustment
in
some
other
direction
or
territory
and
complainant
having
adjusted
its
business
thereto
defendants
may
not
by
an
arbitrary
advance
in
those
rates
destroy
complainant
business
there
being
no
evidence
that
the
rates
advanced
were
less
than
the
cost
of
service
a
similar
decision
was
rendered
on
the
of
june
in
the
case
of
western
oregon
lumber
manufacturers
association
against
the
southern
pacific
company
knowledge
of
the
views
held
by
the
commission
by
the
traffic
officials
and
shippers
will
serve
as
the
most
effective
check
upon
the
part
of
the
carrier
in
advancing
rates
over
those
which
have
been
in
existence
for
any
considerable
period
of
time
unless
they
can
support
the
advance
by
the
most
satisfactory
reasons
would
the
amendment
proposed
be
in
conflict
with
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
an
objection
urged
to
the
approval
of
this
amendment
even
though
modified
as
suggested
in
committee
was
that
it
conflicted
with
the
fifth
amendment
in
depriving
the
carrier
of
its
property
without
due
process
of
law
the
existing
law
authorizes
carriers
to
make
reasonable
rates
congress
recognizing
the
right
of
control
by
the
carrier
has
provided
reasonable
regulations
to
safeguard
the
interests
of
the
public
in
the
exercise
of
that
right
it
authorizes
a
protest
after
the
rate
had
gone
into
effect
it
provides
for
a
full
hearing
after
notice
by
the
commission
it
has
further
extended
the
time
when
the
rate
shall
be
made
effective
to
thirty
days
from
the
filing
of
the
schedule
with
the
commission
these
were
held
to
be
reasonable
regulations
but
it
is
claimed
that
under
the
amendment
proposed
to
the
sixth
section
that
if
the
rate
is
suspended
from
going
into
effect
at
the
end
of
the
thirty
days
by
a
protest
there
is
no
limitation
in
the
act
fixing
the
time
when
the
commission
shall
determine
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
advance
that
the
period
is
therefore
indefinite
depending
upon
numerous
considerations
which
might
extend
the
time
when
the
rate
would
be
effective
if
it
was
finally
held
to
be
reasonable
to
six
months
or
a
year
that
the
act
of
suspension
either
by
the
operation
of
the
statute
or
by
the
commission
is
without
notice
or
hearing
to
the
carrier
that
congress
has
no
greater
right
to
authorize
an
administrative
tribunal
to
suspend
indefinitely
the
taking
effect
of
a
reasonable
rate
without
notice
or
hearing
than
it
has
the
right
to
provide
that
an
administrative
tribunal
may
authorize
a
rate
which
would
yield
less
than
the
cost
of
the
service
it
was
decided
in
the
case
of
chicago
against
minnesota
that
the
right
to
make
a
reasonable
rate
was
a
property
right
in
the
case
of
interstate
commerce
commission
chicago
great
western
the
supreme
court
said
it
must
be
remembered
that
railroads
are
the
private
property
of
their
owners
that
while
from
the
public
character
of
the
work
in
which
they
are
engaged
the
public
has
the
power
to
prescribe
rules
for
securing
faithful
and
efficient
service
and
equality
between
shippers
and
communities
yet
in
no
proper
sense
is
the
public
a
general
manager
justice
brewer
in
the
above
case
page
speaking
for
the
court
said
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
there
is
no
presumption
of
wrong
arising
from
a
change
of
rate
by
a
carrier
the
presumption
of
honest
intent
and
right
conduct
attends
the
action
of
carriers
as
well
as
it
does
the
action
of
other
corporations
or
individuals
in
their
transactions
in
life
undoubtedly
when
rates
are
changed
the
carrier
making
the
change
must
when
properly
called
upon
be
able
to
give
a
good
reason
therefor
but
the
mere
fact
that
a
rate
has
been
raised
carries
with
it
no
presumption
that
it
was
not
rightfully
done
those
presumptions
of
good
faith
and
integrity
which
have
been
recognized
for
ages
as
attending
human
action
have
not
been
overthrown
by
any
legislation
in
respect
to
common
carriers
it
is
claimed
that
the
indefinite
suspension
of
the
rate
until
final
hearing
is
to
deprive
the
carrier
if
the
rate
advanced
is
reasonable
of
its
right
of
property
during
the
period
of
suspension
without
having
given
it
any
opportunity
to
be
heard
prior
to
the
act
of
suspension
due
process
of
law
must
precede
and
should
not
follow
the
suspension
to
set
aside
the
carrier
act
in
fixing
the
rate
pending
the
investigation
required
by
due
process
of
law
is
to
deprive
the
carrier
pro
tanto
of
its
property
right
to
charge
a
reasonable
rate
the
fact
that
the
statute
requires
an
investigation
after
the
suspension
of
the
rate
does
not
avoid
the
constitutional
inhibition
as
that
provision
can
only
be
satisfied
when
the
investigation
precedes
any
disturbance
of
property
rights
the
carrier
is
entitled
to
the
investigation
before
it
is
restrained
in
the
of
its
property
rights
the
theory
of
the
amendment
suggested
is
that
the
shipper
is
entitled
to
an
investigation
before
the
carrier
can
its
property
rights
those
contending
for
this
objection
to
the
amendment
assumed
that
the
indefinite
suspension
without
hearing
of
the
act
of
the
carrier
which
deprived
it
beyond
a
reasonable
time
of
the
benefit
of
the
advanced
rate
was
in
effect
the
same
as
that
which
was
condemned
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
the
chicago
against
minnesota
under
the
statute
of
that
state
a
carrier
had
the
right
to
initiate
the
rate
and
to
put
it
in
effect
and
under
the
law
the
commission
was
authorized
to
make
such
changes
as
it
deemed
proper
in
the
schedule
so
filed
and
to
direct
the
carrier
to
modify
or
change
the
schedule
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
the
tribunal
in
the
one
case
the
going
into
effect
of
the
rate
is
suspended
indefinitely
without
notice
or
hearing
in
the
other
the
rate
is
changed
or
modified
without
hearing
on
page
the
court
condemns
this
in
the
following
language
no
hearing
is
provided
for
no
summons
or
notice
to
the
company
before
the
commission
has
found
what
it
is
to
find
and
declared
what
it
is
to
declare
no
opportunity
provided
for
the
company
to
introduce
witnesses
before
the
commission
in
fact
nothing
which
has
the
semblance
of
the
process
of
law
on
page
the
court
said
if
the
company
is
deprived
of
the
power
of
charging
reasonable
rates
for
the
use
of
its
property
and
such
deprivation
takes
place
in
the
absence
of
an
investigation
by
judicial
machinery
it
is
deprived
of
the
lawful
use
of
its
property
and
thus
in
substance
and
effect
of
the
property
itself
without
due
process
of
law
and
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
this
view
of
the
law
as
announced
in
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
louisville
and
nashville
against
kentucky
it
was
further
suggested
that
if
this
amendment
was
incorporated
in
the
sixth
section
that
it
was
so
fundamental
in
its
character
that
if
the
court
should
hold
that
it
was
an
unconstitutional
exercise
of
power
by
congress
that
it
might
have
the
effect
of
destroying
the
entire
value
of
this
remedial
legislation
as
it
would
be
impossible
to
separate
the
clause
from
those
provisions
of
the
law
directly
controlling
the
subject
of
rates
the
committee
without
expressing
any
opinion
upon
the
constitutional
questions
suggested
feels
that
it
is
of
sufficient
importance
and
gravity
to
cause
it
to
hesitate
to
incorporate
such
amendment
into
the
sixth
section
especially
in
view
of
the
other
objections
to
such
legislation
could
the
commission
under
the
amendment
fix
a
reasonable
rate
if
it
held
the
proposed
advance
rate
unreasonable
one
of
the
most
serious
objections
to
this
measure
if
the
contentions
of
those
who
oppose
it
are
well
founded
is
the
assertion
that
the
adoption
of
this
amendment
would
in
reference
to
advanced
rates
that
were
protested
deprive
the
commission
of
the
power
conferred
upon
it
by
the
fifteenth
section
of
the
act
of
june
empowering
it
if
on
protest
and
hearing
it
found
a
rate
to
be
unreasonable
to
fix
a
reasonable
rate
the
authority
to
the
commission
proposed
in
the
amendment
to
hear
and
determine
the
matter
in
all
respects
as
it
was
required
to
do
by
sections
and
of
this
act
can
only
be
construed
to
refer
to
the
procedure
as
provided
in
the
thirteenth
and
fifteenth
sections
of
the
interstate
commerce
law
there
is
no
attempt
to
amend
the
provisions
of
section
which
confers
upon
the
commission
the
right
to
declare
a
rate
unreasonable
and
when
so
declared
to
fix
a
reasonable
rate
there
are
no
provisions
found
in
the
amendment
suggested
to
the
sixth
section
conferring
upon
the
commission
the
power
when
it
finds
a
rate
proposed
to
be
advanced
unreasonable
that
it
may
then
proceed
to
fix
a
reasonable
rate
an
examination
of
section
in
reference
to
the
power
of
the
commission
to
fix
a
rate
depends
upon
a
condition
precedent
that
is
clearly
set
forth
in
said
section
it
is
that
before
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
fix
a
rate
it
must
first
reach
the
opinion
that
the
rates
or
charges
whatsoever
demanded
charged
or
collected
by
any
common
carrier
or
carriers
or
that
any
regulation
or
practice
whatsoever
of
such
carrier
or
carriers
affecting
such
rates
are
unreasonable
or
unjustly
discriminatory
or
are
unduly
preferential
or
prejudicial
or
otherwise
in
violation
of
the
provisions
of
this
act
when
this
conclusion
has
been
reached
as
to
existing
rates
the
section
then
authorizes
the
commission
to
determine
and
prescribe
what
will
be
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
or
rates
charge
or
charges
to
be
thereafter
observed
in
such
cases
as
the
maximum
to
be
charged
and
what
regulations
or
practice
in
respect
to
such
transportation
is
just
fair
and
reasonable
to
be
thereafter
followed
to
leave
no
doubt
of
the
true
construction
of
this
section
an
examination
of
the
order
required
to
be
entered
by
the
commission
is
conclusive
of
the
meaning
and
intention
of
congress
in
the
enactment
of
this
portion
of
the
fifteenth
section
it
provides
and
to
make
an
order
that
the
carrier
shall
cease
and
desist
from
such
violation
to
the
extent
to
which
the
commission
finds
the
same
to
exist
and
shall
not
thereafter
publish
demand
or
collect
any
rate
or
charge
for
such
transportation
in
excess
of
the
maximum
rate
or
charge
so
prescribed
an
analysis
of
this
order
of
the
commission
which
requires
it
to
provide
that
the
carrier
shall
cease
and
desist
from
such
violation
to
the
extent
to
which
the
commission
finds
the
same
to
exist
recognizes
the
fact
that
the
rate
is
an
existing
rate
is
an
effective
rate
is
a
rate
in
full
operation
and
can
not
therefore
be
applied
under
the
provisions
of
the
amendment
suggested
to
the
sixth
section
as
no
rate
has
gone
into
effect
and
become
operative
the
subject
we
are
considering
as
affected
by
the
proposed
amendment
and
the
provisions
of
the
fifteenth
section
do
not
rest
upon
any
principle
of
the
common
law
but
are
purely
statutory
enactments
to
carry
out
a
policy
in
reference
to
interstate
commerce
deemed
wise
by
congress
the
construction
therefore
of
the
statute
in
this
respect
can
not
be
aided
by
any
principles
of
the
common
law
and
the
conclusion
as
to
its
meaning
must
rest
entirely
upon
the
intention
of
the
legislature
as
expressed
by
the
language
of
the
act
if
this
view
of
the
fifteenth
section
is
correct
the
adoption
of
the
amendment
to
the
sixth
section
would
change
one
of
the
most
effective
provisions
of
the
act
of
june
and
which
was
contended
for
with
such
earnestness
in
its
passage
through
congress
under
the
amendment
to
the
sixth
section
if
adopted
and
a
protest
was
made
to
the
advanced
rate
or
the
commission
under
a
protest
was
authorized
in
its
discretion
to
suspend
the
advanced
rate
until
hearing
as
to
its
reasonableness
the
only
decision
that
could
be
made
under
that
amendment
would
be
that
the
rate
proposed
to
be
advanced
was
either
reasonable
or
unreasonable
but
there
would
exist
no
power
in
the
commission
if
they
found
the
rate
unreasonable
to
fix
what
in
its
judgment
would
be
a
reasonable
rate
the
committee
does
not
believe
that
it
is
the
desire
of
congress
in
view
of
the
sentiment
of
the
country
as
expressed
in
the
press
and
before
it
to
pass
additional
legislation
which
would
invite
and
suggest
such
confusion
and
legal
difficulties
in
the
construction
of
an
act
which
has
not
yet
been
put
in
full
operation
by
the
tribunal
charged
with
that
duty
could
the
decision
of
the
commission
condemning
an
advance
of
rates
be
reviewed
by
the
courts
it
was
suggested
to
the
committee
that
the
incorporation
of
this
amendment
to
the
sixth
section
of
the
act
of
june
would
deprive
the
carrier
of
the
right
to
review
by
a
bill
in
equity
a
decision
of
the
commission
which
denied
to
the
carrier
the
right
to
advance
a
rate
this
contention
is
based
upon
the
ruling
of
the
courts
that
the
making
of
a
future
rate
is
a
legislative
act
and
not
a
question
for
judicial
review
and
that
until
the
rate
is
fixed
and
becomes
effective
it
is
purely
one
within
the
legislative
function
and
presents
no
subject
cognizable
by
the
court
under
the
amendment
proposed
a
carrier
would
file

schedule
of
advanced
rates
a

either
by
operation
of

the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
commission
the
rate
is
suspended
until
final
hearing
subsequently
there
is
a
notice
of
the
hearing
and
a
decision
rendered
adverse
to
the
contention
of
the
carrier
seeking
an
advance
of
the
rate
under
these
circumstances
there
is
no
remedy
of
review
of
that

for
by

for
a
review

by

confers
upon
the

the
right
to
take
jurisdiction
of
a
case
against
the
commission
and
to
review
its
decision
when
based
upon
an
existing
rate
there
is
no
provision
of
the
statute
that
contemplates
the
exercise
of
a
jurisdiction
by
the
courts
in
a
case
arising
under
a
provision

similar
to
the
amendment

to
the
sixth
section
of
the
act
of
june
in
the
decision
rendered
by
the
commission
denying
the
right
to
advance
the
rate
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
former
rate
or
of
any
existing
rate
is
not
involved

commission

proposed
amendment
the
carrier
submits
a
proposition
to

has
never

the
order
of
the
commission
would
simply
approve
the
proposition

deny
the

proposed

of
the
commission

doctrine

and
held
that
before

intervene
the
administrative
body
must
do
some
act
that
advances
beyond
the
legislative
function
reagan

railway
it
is
contended
that
the
decision
of
the
commission
prohibiting
the
advance
is
a
legislative
act
and
that
under
the
decisions
of
the
courts
the
order
simply
prohibiting
the
taking
effect
of
a
proposed
advance
could
not
be
the
subject
of
equitable
cognizance
if
this
view
is
not
correct
it
is
contended
that
the
courts
by
overruling
the
order
of
the
commission
would
in
effect
be
putting
in
force
a
future
rate
under
existing
law
however
if
the
rate
has
taken
effect
its
reasonableness
is
a
matter
of
judicial
review
and
should
the
commission
after
protest
and
hearing
declare
it
to
be
an
unreasonable
rate
and
set
the
same
aside
in
its
order
that
decision
is
reviewable
by
the
courts
as
it
presents
a
judicial
question
the
statute
conferring
upon
the
commission
the
power
to
determine
whether
an
existing
rate
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
has
fixed
the
standard
which
must
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
the
administrative
tribunal
and
the
courts
have
a
right
to
review
the
act
of
the
commission
with
a
view
of
ascertaining
whether
it
has
acted
within
the
limitations
of
the
power
conferred
upon
it
in
the
case
of
the
state
corporation
commission
of
virginia
against

speaking
of
the
power
of
the
commission
to
fix

and
the
appeal
from
its
decision
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
the
court
said
a
judicial
inquiry
investigates
declares
and
enforces
liabilities
as
they
stand
on
present
or
past
facts
and
under
laws
supposed
already
to
exist
that
is
its
purpose
and
end
legislation
on
the
other
hand
looks
to
the
future
and
changes
existing
conditions
by
making
a
new
rule
to
be
applied
thereafter
to
all
or
some
parts
of
those
subject
to
its
power
the
establishment
of
a
rate
is
the
making
of
a
rule
for
the
future
and
therefore
is
an
act
legislative
not
judicial
in
kind
proceedings
legislative
in
nature
are
not
proceedings
in
a
court
within
the
meaning
of
the
revised
statutes
section
no
matter
what
may
be
the
general
or
dominant
character
of
the
body
in
which
they
may
take
place
that
question
depends
not
upon
the
character
of
the
body
but
upon
the
character
of
the
proceedings
ex
parte
they
are
not
a
suit
in
which
a
writ
of
error
would
lie
under
revised
statutes
section
and
act
of
february
litigation
can
not
arise
until
the
moment
of
legislation
is
passed
we
may
add
that
when
the
rate
is
fixed
a
bill
against
the
commission
to
restrain
the
members
from
enforcing
it
will
not
be
bad
as
an
attempt
to
enjoin
legislation
or
as
a
suit
against
a
state
and
will
be
the
proper
form
of
remedy
the
recent
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
public
service
commission
consolidated
gas
of
new
york
in
which
the
opinion
was
delivered
by
justice
peckham
in
deciding
what
is
known
as
the
gas
case
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york
is
instructive
upon
the
question
discussed
in
this
objection
in
that
case
the
parties
had
gone
to
issue
upon
the
question
as
to
whether
the
rate
of
cents
enjoined
by
the
court
from
taking
effect
was
confiscatory
after
deciding
the
case
upon
the
merits
in
favor
of
the
commission
the
court
was
unwilling
upon
the
supposed
effect
of
a
rate
which
had
never
been
in
operation
to
bar
the
parties
of
their
right
when
the
same
became
effective
from
asking
the
protection
of
the
court
against
its
practical
results
the
memorandum
announcing
the
position
of
the
court
upon
that
question
is
as
follows
as
it
may
possibly
be
that
a
practical
experience
of
the
effect
of
the
acts
by
actual
operation
under
them
might
prevent
the
complainant
from
obtaining
a
fair
and
just
return
upon
its
property
used
in
its
business
of
supplying
gas
the
complainant
in
that
event
ought
to
have
the
opportunity
of
again
presenting
its
case
to
the
court
therefore
the
decree
is
reversed
with
direction
to
dismiss
the
bill
without
prejudice
this
case
simply
illustrates
the
fact
that
the
court
was
unwilling
to
decide
the
question
finally
until
the
rate
contested
had
become
effective
this
was
a
suit
involving
a
schedule
of
rates
and
the
question
made
by
the
record
was
that
these
rates
would
result
in
the
confiscation
of
the
property
of
the
complainant
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
where
that
question
can
be
properly
made
the
courts
have
intervened
upon
clear
proof
and
sustained
their
jurisdiction
to
prevent
such
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
protection
in
this
case
although
the
court
held
that
the
evidence
developed
the
fact
that
this
allegation
of
the
bill
was
not
sustained
it
was
so
reluctant
to
give
effect
to
testimony
as
to
what
might
be
the
effect
of
the
rates
before
they
were
made
operative
that
it
preserved
the
rights
of
the
parties
by
authorizing
a
new
suit
after
the
rate
should
become
effective
under
the
act
to
regulate
commerce
such
a
constitutional
question
could
hardly
be
practically
raised
and
the
rights
of
the
court
to
intervene
must
depend
upon
the
limit
placed
upon
the
power
of
the
commission
by
congress
in
the
enactment
of
the
law
in
fixing
the
standard
which
should
guide
the
commission
in
its
action
burden
imposed
on
the
conflict
of
how
rates
are
made
your
committee
has
deemed
it
proper
that
it
should
report
to
the
senate
the
legal
objections
to
the
incorporation
of
this
amendment
in
the
sixth
section
of
the
act
of
the
of
june
but
although
giving
due
weight
to
these
objections
the
committee
has
been
more
strongly
influenced
in
its
adverse
report
upon
this
bill
because
of
the
strong
and
forcible
practical
objections
which
have
been
urged
to
the
adoption
of
this
amendment
as
a
part
of
the
interstate
commerce
law
should
this
amendment
become
a
part
of
the
law
it
would
be
in
the
power
of
any
shipper
whether
interested
or
not
in
the
result
to
file
a
protest
against
the
advance
of
the
rate
which
under
the
proposed
amendment
would
at
once
suspend
its
going
into
effect
and
under
the
amendment
offered
in
committee
would
place
it
in
the
power
of
the
commission
to
order
its
suspension
if
a
prima
facie
case
was
presented
in
the
protest
the
shipper
in
filing
a
protest
assumes
no
responsibility
either
as
to
the
effect
of
his
action
upon
the
carrier
or
liability
in
any
way
for
cost
accruing
during
the
proceeding
considering
the
thousands
of
articles
transported
by
the
carriers
of
the
country
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
rates
published
for
the
transportation
of
these
articles
and
the
thousands
of
shippers
interested
in
their
movement
some
idea
of
the
number
of
protests
that
probably
would
be
filed
on
the
advance
of
rates
can
be
imagined
the
burden
that
would
be
thrown
upon
the
commission
in
its
effort
to
meet
this
responsibility
would
as
judge
cooley
well
remarked
require
superhuman
efforts
on
its
part
he
said
moreover
an
adjudication
upon
a
petition
for
relief
would
in
many
cases
be
far
from
concluding
the
labors
of
the
commission
in
respect
to
the
equities
involved
for
questions
of
rates
assume
new
forms
and
may
require
to
be
met
differently
from
day
to
day
and
in
those
sections
of
the
country
in
which
the
reasons
or
supposed
reasons
for
exceptional
rates
are
most
prevalent
the
commission
would
in
effect
be
required
to
act
as
rate
makers
for
all
the
roads
and
compelled
to
adjust
the
tariffs
so
as
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
business
while
at
the
same
time
endeavoring
to
protect
relative
rights
and
equities
of
rival
carriers
and
rival
localities
this
in
any
considerable
state
would
be
an
enormous
task
in
a
country
so
large
as
ours
and
with
so
vast
a
mileage
of
roads
it
would
be
superhuman
a
construction
of
the
statute
which
should
require
its
performance
would
render
the
due
administration
of
the
law
altogether
impracticable
and
that
fact
tends
strongly
to
show
that
such
a
construction
could
not
have
been
intended
if
the
advance
of
rates
was
ultimately
decided
to
be
reasonable
the
carrier
would
have
been
deprived
during
the
period
of
suspension
of
the
additional
earnings
to
which
it
was
entitled
and
under
such
a
provision
of
law
would
be
required
to
maintain
at
enormous
expense
a
large
force
of
attorneys
to
answer
and
defend
these
protests
it
would
confer
upon
the
commission
the
powers
now
exercised
by
the
courts
and
the
jurisdictions
over
the
same
subject
by
both
the
courts
and
the
commission
would
necessarily
produce
conflict
and
confusion
the
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
texas
pacific
abilene
cotton
oil
construing
the
ninth
and
sections
on
the
right
of
a
shipper
to
apply
to
the
courts
for
pecuniary
redress
for
an
alleged
unreasonable
rate
held
that
until
the
protested
rate
was
condemned
by
the
commission
there
was
no
relief
in
the
courts
this
decision
avoided
a
conflict
of
jurisdiction
between
the
courts
and
the
commission
it
would
lessen
very
greatly
the
value
of
the
amendment
of
the
act
of
june
which
requires
thirty
days
notice
in
a
change
of
rate
which
was
adopted
with
a
view
of
investing
rate
conditions
with
a
greater
degree
of
stability
than
formerly
under
existing
law
the
shipper
is
assured
of
that
degree
of
stability
and
can
predicate
his
sales
and
purchases
accordingly
under
the
amendment
shippers
would
never
know
whether
or
not
a
rate
is
to
become
effective
on
schedule
time
or
at
any
future
time
the
effect
of
the
amendment
would
therefore
be
to
a
considerable
degree
to
nullify
the
permanency
which
this
amendment
to
the
act
to
regulate
commerce
sought
to
impress
upon
the
law
we
must
remember
in
considering
this
question
that
the
majority
of
advances
have
resulted
from
the
practice
of
the
roads
in
the
reduction
of
rates
to
meet
certain
commercial
and
economic
conditions
at
the
time
which
have
usually
been
the
result
of
appeals
from
shippers
and
suggestions
from
commercial
organizations
we
desire
to
direct
attention
to
the
statement
filed
before
the
committee
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
upon
a
similar
bill
to
this
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
the
southwestern
traffic
association
which
is
as
follows
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
changes
in
freight
rates
either
reductions
or
advances
is
evolved
by
railroad
officials
practically
every
change
in
rates
is
the
result
of
suggestion
from
one
or
more
shippers
who
find
that
by
some
modification
in
the
existing
schedules
their
business
in
a
certain
territory
can
be
increased
by
enabling
them
to
meet
competition
which
they
encounter
from
other
sources
of
supply
which
are
in
most
cases
served
by
rival
railroads
their
representation
is
that
by
the
proposed
change
their
profit
or
business
will
be
increased
and
consequently
the
railroad
serving
them
will
share
in
an
augmented
traffic
which
at
the
time
of
the
suggestion
is
being
handled
by
the
rival
shipper
and
carrier
ninety
or
more
per
cent
of
these
suggestions
are
for
reductions
in
rates
or
for
changes
in
rules
and
regulations
beneficial
to
shippers
and
classed
as
reductions
the
railroad
company
is
anxious
at
all
times
to
increase
its
traffic
and
gives
a
keen
ear
to
such
pleas
of
the
shipper
the
railroad
official
to
whom
such
requests
are
made
carefully
investigates
the
conditions
recited
by
the
shipper
and
by
correspondence
with
such
railroad
representatives
at
the
points
of
origin
and
destination
confirms
if
possible
the
views
of
the
shipper
and
the
effect
of
the
proposed
change
on
the
tonnage
and
revenue
of
the
company
the
traffic
official
of
the
railroad
thus
being
daily
engaged
in
investigations
of
this
kind
becomes
very
proficient
in
his
knowledge
of
the
factors
surrounding
the
movement
of
the
principal
articles
of
commerce
and
becomes
after
experience
a
ready
judge
of
the
merit
of
such
propositions
when
thus
convinced
he
becomes
the
agent
of
the
shipper
in
securing
the
proposed
adjustment
this
may
take
the
form
of
suggesting
to
a
rival
railroad
that
the
advantage
which
its
shippers
have
enjoyed
is
unjust
and
that
he
should
be
permitted
without
any
corresponding
reduction
on
the
part
of
such
rival
railroad
to
reduce
his
rate
that
the
complaining
shipper
may
profitably
secure
an
increased
share
of
the
competitive
traffic
in
question
being
unable
to
thus
persuade
the
competing
railroad
of
the
merits
of
such
a
contention
he
is
forced
to
proceed
by
reducing
his
own
rate
without
regard
to
the
possible
change
which
may
follow
on
the
part
of
other
railroads
as
a
consequence
of
his
reduction
it
will
therefore
naturally
be
seen
that
the
railroad
official
and
the
shipper
are
constantly
planning
to
increase
the
business
in
which
they
are
jointly
interested
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
rival
railroad
and
shipper
sometimes
these
efforts
result
in
serious
rate
wars
until
the
point
in
controversy
has
been
adjusted
and
the
competitive
rates
placed
on
a
basis
which
is
more
nearly
equitable
to
all
concerned
in
many
instances
these
disputes
result
in
arbitration
either
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
by
individuals
who
may
be
agreed
upon
by
the
contending
interests
bearing
in
mind
therefore
that
practically
all
rate
reductions
are
the
result
of
the
effort
of
the
railroad
company
to
serve
the
shipper
it
can
easily
be
seen
what
the
result
will
be
if
no
advances
in
rates
can
be
made
without
practically
the
approval
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
where
it
is
difficult
to
restore
rates
to
normal
figures
the
carrier
will
be
loath
to
reduce
them
in
order
that
the
shipper
dependent
upon
such
carrier
may
increase
for
the
time
being
his
share
in
the
competitive
traffic
in
which
he
is
interested
adjustment
of
interrelation
of
practical
operation
of
amendment
the
subject
of
rate
adjustment
even
upon
a
single
system
of
transportation
is
one
involving
great
difficulty
and
perplexity
when
this
adjustment
is
considered
in
its
relation
to
the
entire
country
to
the
diversified
commercial
conditions
as
affected
by
commercial
competition
and
as
controlled
by
the
interrelation
of
rates
it
stands
forth
as
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
all
the
problems
which
must
be
mastered
that
the
transportation
agencies
may
not
be
injuriously
crippled
in
the
performance
of
their
quasi
public
functions
or
the
prosperity
and
development
of
the
commercial
interests
be
retarded
by
the
failure
to
enact
proper
reasonable
and
just
governmental
regulations
rates
which
can
be
considered
alone
are
comparatively
few
in
number
in
the
large
majority
of
cases
they
are
interrelated
with
other
rates
and
frequently
this
interrelation
exists
as
between
areas
widely
separated
the
rates
upon
iron
and
steel
from
mills
within
to
miles
of
new
york
philadelphia
and
baltimore
whose
relations
to
each
other
are
established
by
long
custom
and
usage
are
based
primarily
upon
the
necessity
of
preserving
a
fair
comparative
charge
between
the
different
shipping
points
and
destinations
rates
upon
coal
from
central
pennsylvania
to
tide
water
have
close
relations
with
the
rates
upon
coal
from
west
virginia
to
tide
water
competing
as
such
coal
does
in
the
same
markets
the
rates
upon
lumber
from
the
michigan
markets
must
bear
some
relation
to
the
rates
on
lumber
from
louisiana
and
georgia
to
the
same
market
of
distribution
although
separated
by
hundreds
of
miles
the
rates
upon
grain
from
western
farms
to
eastern
points
bear
a
relation
to
the
other
and
upon
export
grain
the
rates
to
the
atlantic
seaboard
bear
a
close
relation
to
the
rates
to
the
gulf
the
rates
upon
fruit
and
vegetable
traffic
from
the
various
shipping
districts
as
california
on
the
west
and
florida
on
the
south
must
be
considered
in
the
making
of
rates
the
structure
of
rates
between
the
territory
east
of
the
mississippi
and
north
of
the
ohio
river
and
the
territory
east
of
pittsburg
and
buffalo
including
new
england
is
closely
interrelated
as
an
example
the
rates
between
chicago
and
new
york
take
a
percentage
of
the
chicago
rate
from
all
points
west
of
pittsburg
and
buffalo
the
principle
of
the
interrelation
of
rates
has
frequently
been
recognized
in
the
decisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
the
interest
of
the
manufacturer
there
is
a
very
important
relationship
between
rates
upon
different
products
entering
into
the
manufacture
of
a
given
article
in
the
great
districts
of
the
shenango
and
mahoning
valleys
and
pittsburg
for
many
years
the
rates
upon
raw
material
to
the
furnaces
for
the
production
of
pig
iron
have
been
adjusted
upon
a
basis
so
far
as
possible
of
making
the
freight
cost
of
assembling
the
raw
materials
that
enter
into
this
product
the
same
to
each
furnace
in
the
one
case
the
rate
upon
coke
may
be
higher
and
the
rate
upon
ore
or
limestone
lower
in
other
cases
the
reverse
the
adjustment
of
rates
upon
these
different
raw
materials
is
so
made
that
when
assembled
at
the
different
furnaces
the
aggregate
cost
is
relatively
the
same
this
illustrates
the
contention
that
such
rates
can
not
be
considered
separately
but
must
be
taken
as
a
whole
bearing
these
facts
in
mind
it
is
manifest
that
if
an
advance
in
rates
is
made
and
the
protest
of
one
shipper
shall
operate
as
a
stay
to
the
advance
of
a
particular
rate
in
which
he
may
be
interested
the
result
would
be
to
burden
thousands
of
other
shippers
who
have
made
no
objection
the
protesting
shipper
would
thus
secure
an
advantage
enjoying
for
a
time
at
least
a
rate
relatively
lower
than
that
to
which
he
was
entitled
it
might
be
urged
that
it
would
be
open
to
all
other
shippers
to
file
similar
protests
but
under
the
provisions
of
the
bill
or
of
the
amendments
suggested
in
committee
the
protesting
shipper
might
wait
until
the
last
day
of
the
period
thus
giving
no
opportunity
to
other
shippers
who
would
be
ignorant
of
his
purpose
to
file
their
protest
it
would
be
possible
if
this
amendment
became
a
law
that
many
individual
shippers
would
take
advantage
of
their
competitors
by
making
contracts
upon
the
basis
of
a
lower
rate
and
at
the
last
moment
file
the
protest
suspend
the
advance
rate
and
deliver
their
product
under
such
contracts
within
the
period
of
the
suspension
of
the
advanced
rates
and
thus
profit
at
the
expense
of
their
competitors
the
effect
of
this
amendment
becomes
more
serious
where
the
relation
of
rates
is
between
wide
areas
and
these
relative
rate
adjustments
can
not
be
made
simultaneously
the
rates
upon
grain
for
export
from
the
west
to
the
gulf
as
compared
with
the
atlantic
seaboard
will
illustrate
this
statement
the
protest
of
one
shipper
between
two
specific
points
would
not
only
result
in
throwing
out
of
relation
the
rates
from
all
points
in
that
section
but
would
also
affect
the
competitive
rates
from
other
sections
such
a
result
would
necessarily
render
the
rate
situation
in
reference
to
the
grain
rates
confusion
worse
confounded
rates
in
a
country
like
the
united
states
which
is
comparatively
young
and
the
development
of
which
attracts
the
attention
of
the
world
must
necessarily
be
elastic
not
only
in
the
interest
of
the
carrier
but
of
the
shipping
public
the
principle
is
sound
and
has
received
the
approval
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
rates
must
be
fixed
with
regard
to
their
relations
one
with
the
other
and
not
entirely
upon
the
cost
of
service
this
relation
is
because
of
the
competition
between
shippers
between
sections
of
shippers
and
between
localities
and
as
because
of
the
rapid
development
of
our
country
in
the
production
of
new
sources
of
supply
in
the
opening
up
of
new
grain
fields
flour
mills
mines
and
factories
etc
this
competition
is
constantly
changing
it
is
manifest
that
rates
must
constantly
fluctuate
so
as
to
be
adjusted
to
the
new
condition
it
is
essential
in
the
development
of
the
country
even
in
the
older
sections
that
rates
must
be
elastic
which
means
constant
reductions
and
advances
this
is
in
the
interest
of
communities
and
the
individual
shipper
there
must
be
elasticity
for
other
reasons
in
the
interest
of
communities
as
of
the
railroads
in
meeting
changes
in
commercial
conditions
that
necessitates
reductions
in
rates
for
shorter
or
longer
periods
as
an
illustration
to
enable
our
grain
and
other
products
of
the
farm
to
reach
foreign
markets
which
would
be
impossible
in
one
period
unless
rates
were
lowered
whereas
in
other
periods
higher
rates
could
be
charged
without
injurious
results
understanding
the
conditions
that
surround
this
complex
subject
it
is
manifest
that
if
a
single
shipper
or
even
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
to
have
the
power
to
prevent
at
any
time
that
elasticity
which
involves
an
advance
in
rates
the
natural
result
will
be
that
reductions
will
not
be
made
by
the
carrier
and
the
elasticity
will
be
lost
the
fear
would
be
ever
presented
to
the
mind
of
the
traffic
official
that
the
rate
once
reduced
could
not
at
least
until
after
exhaustive
and
hearings
before
the
commission
be
advanced
the
necessary
fluctuation
in
rates
to
meet
the
changing
conditions
of
commerce
when
examined
in
the
light
of
the
reports
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
startling
to
one
not
familiar
with
the
rapid
change
of
commercial
conditions
in
this
country
there
were
tariff
publications
filed
with
the
commission
in
one
year
all
containing
changes
of
rates
either
reductions
or
increases
and
rules
governing
transportation
these
publications
many
of
them
contained
a
great
number
of
different
tariffs
the
pennsylvania
lines
east
of
pittsburg
issued
tariffs
and
supplements
about
per
cent
of
these
covered
advances
and
per
cent
were
reductions
as
the
law
exists
today
there
was
no
special
inducement
to
the
shipper
to
file
protests
against
the
advances
suppose
however
that
this
amendment
had
been
a
part
of
the
act
to
regulate
commerce
how
many
protests
would
have
been
filed
and
what
length
of
time
would
it
have
taken
the
commission
to
have
disposed
of
them
what
uncertainty
would
have
resulted
to
the
commercial
interests
while
waiting
for
the
adjudication
of
these
questions
opportunity
for
fraud
and
discrimination
under
the
amendment
one
of
the
most
serious
objections
urged
to
the
passage
of
this
amendment
is
the
opportunity
which
such
a
law
would
present
for
the
perpetration
of
frauds
under
it
and
in
the
case
of
even
honest
protest
to
the
advance
of
rates
where
rates
rest
on
a
differential
basis
in
producing
thousands
of
instances
of
unfair
discrimination
an
example
under
the
first
proposition
may
be
stated
briefly
as
follows
there
are
two
men
engaged
in
the
same
line
of
trade
they
are
both
called
upon
to
bid
on
a
contract
involving
a
large
amount
of
a
given
commodity
in
which
both
deal
the
carrier
has
given
notice
of
an
advance
in
rate
effective
thirty
days
from
the
filing
and
publication
of
the
schedule
the
commodity
is
not
to
move
for
some
days
one
of
the
bidders
files
his
bid
based
upon
the
advanced
rate
assuming
that
the
notice
of
the
carrier
will
be
made
effective
the
other
shipper
and
bidder
waits
until
two
or
three
days
before
the
date
the
rate
is
to
be
made
effective
files
a
protest
confident
that
it
will
take
three
or
four
months
to
have
the
matter
adjudicated
files
his
bid
against
his
competitor
based
on
the
current
rate
and
being
the
lowest
secures
the
contract
an
example
under
the
second
proposition
would
be
in
case
of
a
rate
published
from
louis
to
be
followed
differentially
from
chicago
by
a
number
of
competing
roads
a
shipper
on
one
of
the
lines
just
prior
to
the
taking
effect
of
the
rate
would
file
his
protest
as
to
the
rate
east
of
chicago
the
differential
adjustment
that
has
been
made
by
all
these
roads
will
at
once
be
destroyed
and
the
shipper
on
the
road
against
which
the
protest
was
filed
would
have
the
advantage
over
all
of
his
competitors
on
the
other
lines
in
shipping
east
these
discriminations
between
shippers
would
be
the
direct
result
of
the
power
placed
by
congress
in
the
hands
of
shippers
and
would
have
received
the
sanction
of
legislative
approval
and
therefore
be
lawful
the
statute
has
taken
it
out
of
the
power
of
the
carrier
to
meet
such
a
condition
and
to
prevent
the
discrimination
it
can
not
change
its
rate
under
thirty
days
without
a
special
order
of
the
commission
and
that
order
it
must
be
assumed
can
not
be
granted
without
a
reasonable
hearing
congress
since
has
sought
by
the
most
stringent
measures
of
legislation
to
prevent
discrimination
and
preserve
equality
among
shippers
the
original
act
was
demanded
more
to
accomplish
that
purpose
than
for
any
other
the
elkins
act
was
confined
almost
entirely
to
the
subject
and
the
act
of
june
increased
the
penalties
for
the
violation
of
these
provisions
should
this
policy
which
has
been
followed
for
more
than
twenty
years
be
modified
and
an
act
passed
the
tendency
of
which
is
to
tempt
the
cupidity
of
the
shipper
to
accomplish
results
which
it
has
earnestly
and
vigorously
fought
to
stamp
out
would
prevent
reductions
as
well
as
advances
in
rates
and
destroy
their
flexibility
on
the
face
of
this
amendment
it
seems
only
to
give
to
the
commission
the
authority
to
prevent
an
increase
in
rates
but
the
practical
result
of
such
a
law
would
be
far
more
reaching
such
a
law
would
mean
a
rigid
freight
tariff
in
place
of
the
present
flexible
and
elastic
system
of
rates
which
exists
alone
in
this
country
stability
of
freight
rates
is
important
but
not
to
the
extent
that
the
carrier
shall
not
feel
warranted
in
promptly
applying
remedies
for
the
relief
or
assistance
of
shippers
who
find
themselves
no
longer
able
to
compete
due
to
advantages
which
other
shippers
have
secured
or
changes
which
have
occurred
in
the
conditions
surrounding
the
marketing
of
their
products
a
law
which
tends
to
minimize
the
commercial
or
competitive
conditions
existing
at
the
present
time
will
necessarily
result
to
the
disadvantage
of
shippers
to
the
carrier
and
to
the
communities
they
serve
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
again
refer
to
the
presentation
of
the
importance
of
the
flexibility
of
rates
which
is
so
clearly
shown
in
the
discussion
of
the
influences
which
control
in
making
reductions
as
well
as
advances
of
rates
by
the
chairman
of
the
southwestern
traffic
committee
as
quoted
under
section
of
this
report
the
more
the
committee
has
reflected
upon
the
probable
tendency
of
the
principle
announced
by
this
amendment
if
incorporated
into
the
law
the
more
definite
has
become
its
conviction
that
it
would
ultimately
result
in
destroying
that
important
factor
in
american
railroad
management
the
flexibility
of
their
tariffs
their
adaptability
to
the
changing
commercial
and
economic
conditions
one
of
the
most
distinguished
and
skilled
traffic
officials
in
the
country
henry
fink
in
considering
this
amendment
uses
the
following
language
railroad
officials
are
constantly
engaged
in
the
work
of
adjusting
rates
so
as
to
meet
as
far
as
practicable
the
requirement
of
their
patrons
in
times
of
depression
of
business
they
make
reduction
in
rates
in
order
to
enable
shippers
to
send
their
commodities
to
certain
markets
and
keep
industrial
establishments
from
being
closed
these
reduced
rates
are
often
so
low
as
to
barely
cover
the
cost
of
transportation
but
they
are
meant
to
be
temporary
in
their
operation
and
to
be
advanced
when
business
conditions
have
become
more
favorable
it
must
be
obvious
that
when
the
restoration
of
such
rates
is
obstructed
so
that
railroad
officials
are
not
permitted
to
advance
rates
except
by
permission
of
a
government
bureau
after
an
investigation
which
must
consume
considerable
time
railroad
officials
will
naturally
hesitate
and
often
decline
to
make
reductions
in
rates
which
involve
considerable
loss
of
revenue
without
any
compensating
benefits
to
their
companies
either
in
the
present
or
future
it
is
easy
to
see
the
effect
of
this
railroads
would
no
longer
be
able
to
afford
the
desired
assistance
to
shippers
however
anxious
they
might
be
to
do
so
the
rates
would
in
a
large
measure
lose
their
elasticity
and
become
rigid
and
a
condition
similar
to
that
existing
in
france
would
be
created
where
state
controlled
rates
prevent
railroads
from
building
up
the
territory
in
considering
this
question
we
must
not
forget
that
when
we
destroy
elasticity
and
flexibility
in
our
rates
we
prevent
reductions
of
rates
as
well
as
the
raising
of
rates
its
tendency
is
not
only
to
prevent
the
reduction
in
particular
instances
that
has
resulted
in
great
advantage
to
the
shippers
and
the
country
in
the
past
but
it
prevents
the
lowering
of
the
general
average
of
rates
there
have
been
comparatively
few
complaints
as
to
the
unreasonableness
of
the
rates
of
this
country
per
se
the
vast
majority
of
complaints
against
the
reasonableness
of
rates
is
the
claim
that
they
are
relatively
unreasonable
under
the
american
system
of
rate
adjustment
with
its
freedom
to
meet
commercial
and
economic
conditions
the
general
average
of
rates
per
ton
per
mile
has
voluntarily
been
reduced
by
the
carriers
of
the
country
from
not
so
strikingly
since
as
previously
but
substantial
reduction
as
follows
j
the
leaders
of
railroad
management
and
the
ablest
experts
on
railroad
economics
in
foreign
countries
have
approved
in
the
most
enthusiastic
language
the
wisdom
which
has
preserved
to
the
american
railway
system
its
freedom
of
management
and
its
flexibility
of
rates
subject
only
to
the
limitations
of
reasonable
rates
equality
among
shippers
and
the
avoiding
of
all
devices
that
might
result
in
discrimination
among
those
who
use
these
public
means
of
transportation
the
view
of
emile
heurteau
president
of
the
orleans
railroad
speaking
of
the
american
system
of
roads
said
we
would
be
only
too
glad
to
adopt
the
american
system
of
fixing
the
lowest
rates
proper
and
making
up
the
loss
of
profit
on
each
shipment
out
of
the
increased
volume
of
business
they
make
the
railways
available
to
which
is
the
only
economically
and
commercially
right
and
sensible
way
of
doing
we
would
be
glad
to
build
up
our
territory
as
the
american
railways
do
by
encouraging
its
industries
by
opening
its
markets
by
enabling
it
to
compete
with
other
territory
contributing
to
the
same
markets
but
we
can
not
do
that
the
rates
prevent
it
however
strong
our
desire
or
the
people
may
be
railroads
under
government
supervision
must
set
their
rates
close
to
the
maxima
then
and
maintain
them
there
for
their
own
salvation
there
are
many
times
when
if
it
were
possible
we
would
like
to
lower
freight
charges
to
meet
some
special
emergency
such
as
the
necessities
of
a
district
suffering
from
a
crop
failure
for
example
that
is
not
philanthropy
but
commercial
sense
to
help
the
man
who
creates
business
for
you
when
he
is
hard
pressed
and
to
increase
the
volume
of
traffic
that
is
falling
because
people
have
not
the
money
to
pay
the
price
they
have
been
accustomed
to
pay
easily
but
if
we
should
once
lower
our
rates
possibly
to
the
point
of
loss
as
american
railways
have
done
frequently
in
crises
we
would
not
be
allowed
to
restore
them
later
when
they
could
be
fairly
restored
the
wonderful
growth
and
development
of
the
united
states
is
the
admiration
of
the
whole
world
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
to
be
attributed
largely
to
the
freedom
you
have
always
enjoyed
in
your
commercial
and
industrial
life
opportunity
is
given
here
for
railways
and
communities
to
be
mutually
helpful
and
splendid
use
has
been
made
and
is
being
made
of
it
the
few
cases
of
complaints
against
your
railways
the
expansion
of
trade
through
the
opening
of
european
markets
to
the
producers
of
your
central
and
western
states
who
are
enabled
to
deliver
their
products
abroad
the
low
cost
of
transportation
that
enables
them
to
compete
there
with
the
foreign
producer
near
at
hand
whose
railways
are
in
no
position
to
help
him
all
these
things
seem
to
me
sufficient
evidence
of
the
success
and
desirability
of
the
american
practice
in
the
management
and
regulation
of
railway
matters
any
economist
any
business
man
any
transportation
manager
will
tell
you
that
the
present
american
method
of
fixing
freight
rates
is
the
only
logical
and
rational
one
in
the
investigation
of
railways
by
the
senate
committee
in
acworth
who
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
leading
experts
in
england
on
railroad
transportation
and
railroad
economics
was
invited
to
appear
before
the
committee
with
the
request
to
give
a
review
of
the
historical
facts
bearing
on
the
control
and
management
of
the
railways
of
england
after
complying
with
the
request
of
the
committee
certain
questions
were
asked
him
that
were
of
great
importance
at
that
time
in
the
consideration
of
the
questions
then
being
investigated
by
the
committee
one
of
these
questions
involved
the
effect
of
the
provision
of
the
new
canal
and
traffic
act
of
parliament
which
for
the
first
time
embodied
the
provision
that
railway
companies
must
make
no
increase
except
for
good
cause
if
anybody
objects
and
which
as
construed
by
the
courts
prevented
any
increase
of
a
rate
where
objection
was
made
until
after
hearing
by
the
board
of
trade
his
examination
will
be
found
in
the
third
volume
of
the
hearings
of
that
investigation
pages
and
and
was
as
follows
since
it
has
been
decided
that
no
rate
can
be
put
up
once
it
has
been
put
down
without
appeal
to
the
law
courts
the
railway
companies
have
practically
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
they
will
not
put
them
down
because
they
do
not
know
whether
they
will
have
an
opportunity
to
put
them
up
again
senator
cullom
do
you
think
it
works
to
the
advantage
of
the
people
that
the
railways
will
not
put
the
rates
down
for
fear
they
will
not
get
a
chance
to
put
them
up
again
acworth
personally
i
have
no
doubt
it
does
not
it
is
fair
to
remember
always
that
it
may
protect
the
weaker
in
commercial
strife
it
is
rather
hard
on
the
weaker
man
to
be
crowded
to
the
wall
by
a
wholesale
concern
in
any
walk
of
life
but
if
it
be
true
in
ordinary
business
that
on
the
whole
the
public
gains
by
the
wholesaling
method
it
is
probably
true
in
railway
business
also
i
think
that
so
to
speak
the
heart
has
been
taken
out
of
the
railway
man
the
railway
men
understand
this
business
they
know
how
to
manage
it
in
their
own
way
the
railway
men
think
responsibility
has
ceased
to
be
ours
we
must
maintain
the
status
quo
and
that
is
what
they
do
the
chairman
you
think
that
dividing
responsibility
impairs
the
administrative
power
of
the
officials
of
the
roads
as
well
as
the
service
they
render
to
the
public
acworth
from
the
operating
point
of
view
i
do
not
think
our
railways
have
been
sufficiently
interfered
with
to
prevent
them
developing
the
goodness
of
the
service
but
as
to
rate
making
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
interference
of
parliament
the
courts
and
the
executive
has
all
tended
to
stereotype
and
keep
rates
at
an
unnecessarily
high
level
the
chairman
would
you
say
that
on
the
whole
the
power
to
make
rates
generally
and
primarily
should
be
left
to
the
railroads
and
to
the
free
play
of
the
forces
of
the
business
world
acworth
speaking
as
an
individual
student
i
have
no
doubt
that
that
is
the
process
that
will
arrive
at
the
best
results
for
the
community
with
this
exception
that
i
fully
think
it
is
necessary
that
the
community
in
some
way
should
interfere
to
protect
all
customers
from
unfair
treatment
the
chairman
you
think
that
the
power
should
reside
somewhere
to
correct
excessive
and
extortionate
rates
by
summary
and
proper
proceedings
acworth
i
am
not
sure
that
i
should
go
so
far
as
to
say
excessive
rates
regarded
as
excessive
in
themselves
i
am
myself
inclined
to
think
that
excessive
rates
will
correct
themselves
the
wise
men
will
discover
that
it
does
not
pay
to
charge
excessive
rates
but
i
think
the
law
should
interfere
to
prevent
unfair
rates
to
a
as
compared
with
the
rates
given
to
b
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
is
bound
to
insist
that
the
rates
shall
be
public
and
that
practically
will
settle
it
for
if
they
are
public
they
have
got
to
be
fair
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
law
should
confine
itself
to
securing
that
where
there
is
a
difference
made
as
between
a
and
b
the
difference
should
be
a
difference
for
a
commercial
reason
and
not
for
any
reason
of
personal
favoritism
senator
foraker
and
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
effect
of
fixing
maximum
rates
is
to
lessen
the
tendency
to
reduce
rates
which
railroads
had
practiced
before
this
legislation
was
enacted
acworth
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
the
maxima
have
really
had
very
much
effect
at
all
it
has
been
a
tendency
but
i
do
not
think
an
important
tendency
but
the
interpretation
by
the
courts
of
the
undue
preference
law
and
the
recent
limitation
that
having
once
reduced
you
can
not
subsequently
increase
have
had
that
effect
markedly
i
believe
senator
foraker
so
that
the
rates
for
the
transportation
of
freight
on
railroads
in
england
have
not
been
declining
i
take
it
from
your
statement
in
recent
years
but
have
remained
practically
stationary
acworth
i
do
not
know
what
the
average
rate
is
because
there
are
no
statistics
in
england
but
my
own
impression
would
be
that
it
had
probably
not
declined
to
an
appreciable
extent
whereas
in
an
earlier
period
it
certainly
did
decline
pretty
fast
the
effect
of
a
similar
law
passed
in
england
as
shown
by
the
testimony
of
acworth
confirms
the
views
of
the
committee
which
have
been
expressed
in
this
report
that
with
such
a
provision
embodied
in
the
present
interstate
commerce
law
there
would
be
few
reductions
or
advances
in
american
rates
if
it
had
the
effect
in
england
of
destroying
the
flexibility
of
the
rates
of
the
carrier
and
interfered
with
the
development
of
england
commerce
as
well
as
her
railroads
how
much
more
serious
would
be
the
result
in
this
country
that
is
in
the
process
of
rapid
development
both
as
to
its
commerce
and
territory
it
has
been
credibly
stated
that
the
board
of
trade
of
england
is
now
seriously
considering
a
recommendation
for
the
repeal
of
that
provision
of
the
statute
an
analysis
of
the
communication
to
the
commission
many
of
its
objections
apply
to
the
amendment
offered
in
committee
when
this
bill
was
referred
to
your
committee
for
its
consideration
the
chairman
addressed
a
letter
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
inclosing
the
bill
and
requested
the
opinion
of
the
commission
as
to
the
wisdom
of
incorporating
the
amendment
into
the
interstate
commerce
law
the
chairman
replied
in
the
following
communication
interstate
commerce
commission
january
hon
stephen
elkins
committee
on
interstate
states
senate
washington
dear
sir
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
the
honor
to
submit
the
following
in
response
to
your
communication
of
instant
transmitting
a
bill
to
amend
section
of
the
act
to
regulate
commerce
introduced
by
senator
fulton
december
and
requesting
the
commission
to
the
committee
before
its
next
meeting
january
their
opinion
of
said
bill
and
what
action
they
would
suggest
thereon
whilst
the
views
of
the
entire
commission
can
not
be
definitely
ascertained
within
the
time
named
because
of
absences
on
official
business
a
majority
of
the
commissioners
and
probably
all
of
them
would
not
be
disposed
to
favor
the
enactment
of
this
measure
to
give
to
the
protest
of
a
single
shipper
the
effect
of
preventing
the
advance
of
any
rate
until
the
reasonableness
of
that
advance
was
affirmatively
determined
by
the
commission
would
establish
a
hard
and
fast
rule
of
doubtful
fairness
to
the
railroads
and
questionable
advantage
to
the
public
under
existing
conditions
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
unwise
to
adopt
the
arbitrary
limitation
which
this
bill
proposes
whatever
may
be
found
desirable
or
necessary
in
this
regard
in
the
future
it
is
further
to
be
observed
that
the
passage
of
such
a
bill
at
this
time
would
impose
a
burden
upon
the
commission
which
it
ought
not
to
be
asked
to
undertake
if
every
proposed
advance
had
to
be
investigated
by
the
commission
and
officially
sanctioned
before
it
could
take
effect
the
number
of
cases
to
be
considered
would
presumably
be
so
great
as
to
render
their
prompt
disposition
almost
impossible
in
instances
of
justifiable
increase
the
necessary
delay
resulting
from
the
probable
volume
of
cases
would
work
injustice
to
the
carriers
until
conditions
become
more
stable
and
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
act
are
more
completely
observed
in
railway
tariffs
and
practices
we
entertain
the
belief
that
a
wider
latitude
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
carriers
than
this
measure
allows
should
be
permitted
it
is
also
suggested
that
the
practical
effect
of
the
proposed
amendment
might
be
to
prevent
voluntary
reductions
of
rates
by
the
carriers
if
no
rate
could
be
increased
without
the
approval
of
the
commission
after
affirmative
showing
by
the
carrier
it
might
happen
that
many
reductions
now
voluntarily
accorded
would
not
be
made
this
subject
of
rate
advances
was
discussed
in
our
recent
annual
report
to
the
congress
and
that
portion
of
the
report
is
transmitted
herewith
for
the
information
of
your
committee
it
concludes
with
a
recommendation
relating
to
the
matter
in
question
in
which
the
entire
commission
concurred
and
that
recommendation
is
now
respectfully
renewed
very
respectfully
martin
knapp
it
will
be
observed
by
an
examination
of
this
communication
from
the
commission
that
it
deemed
it
unwise
to
recommend
the
adoption
of
the
amendment
to
the
sixth
section
as
offered
in
senate
bill
but
the
letter
refers
to
its
former
report
as
expressive
of
its
views
upon
this
subject
which
recommended
a
somewhat
similar
provision
but
differing
in
this
respect
in
senate
bill
the
filing
of
a
protest
would
suspend
the
taking
effect
of
the
rate
until
after
full
hearing
as
to
the
merits
of
the
advance
the
recommendation
of
the
commission
in
its
former
report
referred
to
in
the
communication
recommended
the
adoption
of
a
provision
that
would
confer
upon
the
commission
upon
the
filing
of
a
complaint
the
discretion
to
suspend
the
rate
until
final
hearing
the
amendment
to
the
bill
before
your
committee
offered
during
its
consideration
and
which
has
been
fully
discussed
in
this
report
was
in
substance
the
recommendation
of
the
commission
an
analysis
of
the
letter
of
the
chairman
of
the
commission
stating
the
objections
to
the
enactments
of
the
proposed
amendment

law
sustains
many
of
the
reasons
which
have
been
urged
in
this
report
against
the
approval
of
the
principle

by
that
amendment

modification

in
any
way
changing

principle

it

practical
results

would
flow
from
its
adoption
if
the
power
was
conferred
upon
the
commission
when
a
rate
was
advanced
upon
complaint
to
suspend
the
going
into
effect
of
that
rate
until
a
final
hearing
every
objection
urged
by
the
commission
to
the
adoption
of
the
bill
but
the
first
two
would
be
applicable
to
the
modification
proposed
by
the
commission
to
the
original
amendment
under
the
modification
suggested
by
the
commission
the
burden
imposed
upon
it
would
be
greater
if
possible
than
under
the
original
amendment
under
the
original
amendment
by
force
of
the
statute
the
filing
of
the
protest
would
suspend
the
advanced
rate
and
the
hearing
upon
the
merits
would
take
place
after
the
thirty
days
had
expired
under
the
suggestion
of
the
commission
conferring
upon
it
the
discretionary
authority
upon
complaint
to
determine
whether
the
rate
should
go
into
effect
at
the
time
prescribed
by
law
or
be
suspended
there
is
imposed
an
official
quasi
judicial
duty
upon
the
commission
which
it
should
not
perform
except
upon
proof
that
probably
the
rate
sought
to
be
advanced
would
ultimately
be
determined
to
be
unreasonable
remembering
the
large
number
of
changes
of
rates
daily
and
the
fact
that
under
the
law
the
complaint
could
be
filed
at
any
time
within
the
thirty
days
would
it
not
be
an
impossible
undertaking
for
the
commission
to
hope
to
perform
this
official
act
with
justice
to
the
public
or
to
the
carrier
in
the
multiplicity
of
duties
now
demanding
its
most
earnest
attention
would
not
the
practical
operation
of
such
a
law
compel
it
to
enter
a
pro
forma
order
of
suspension
until
the
final
hearing
when
the
commission
upon
an
examination
of
the
complaint
is
satisfied
that
it
presented
a
prima
facie
case
of
unreasonable
advance
an
official
tribunal
charged
with
the
duty
of
preventing
an
unreasonable
advance
in
rates
would
be
constrained
on
the
presentation
of
such
a
complaint
to
issue
the
order
of
suspension
if
the
slightest
doubt
was
raised
in
its
mind
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
advance
its
official
obligation
would
require
it
to
enter
the
order
of
suspension
is
there
any
question
that
such
a
prima
facie
case
could
be
made
where
the
consideration
of
the
protest
would
of
necessity
be
ex
parte
the
committee
is
not
therefore
able
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
original
amendment
and
that
proposed
in
committee
in
the
opinion
of
the
committee
the
reasons
stated
in
the
letter
of
the
chairman
of
the
commission
and
the
reasons
given
in
this
report
not
only
justify
it
but
compel
an
adverse
report
conditions
confronting
congress
the
act
of
june
took
effect
august
it
has
been
operative
only
about
months
during
half
of
that
period
of
time
the
country
has
experienced
the
effects
of
a
severe
commercial
panic
business
has
been
prostrated
transportation
paralyzed
thousands
of
cars
have
been
stored
on
the
sidings
and
hundreds
of
engines
have
been
placed
in
the
shops
awaiting
the
revival
of
business
from
conditions
existing
today
we
have
a
right
to
assume
that
before
many
months
we
shall
be
approaching
normal
conditions
the
commission
has
not
had
sufficient
time
to
interpret
and
construe
the
recent
law
and
to
promulgate
its
orders
in
reference
to
the
action
of
the
carriers
under
it
many
of
the
traffic
questions
involved
under
the
provisions
of
that
law
are
yet
to
be
construed
and
put
in
force
by
orders
of
the
commission
is
it
wise
under
these
conditions
to
begin
amending
that
statute
by
introducing
provisions
inconsistent
with
the
basis
of
the
act
it
has
been
shown
that
under
the
power
conferred
by
that
recent
enactment
the
commission
is
vested
with
the
power
to
change
an
existing
unreasonable
rate
and
to
fix
for
the
future
a
reasonable
rate
it
has
also
the
authority
conferred
upon
it
to
award
reparation
to
the
extent
of
any
injury
resulting
to
a
shipper
by
reason
of
the
existence
of
an
unreasonable
rate
attention
has
been
called
to
the
opinion
of
the
commission
as
expressed
in
its
decisions
narrowing
very
greatly
the
right
of
the
carrier
to
advance
a
rate
that
would
meet
with
its
approval
upon
hearing
the
committee
must
assume
in
considering
this
question
that
both
the
shippers
and
traffic
officials
with
knowledge
of
the
views
entertained
by
the
commission
upon
the
question
of
an
advance
of
rates
will
in
the
one
case
be
prompt
to
avail
themselves
of
that
attitude
of
the
commission
and
in
the
other
that
they
will
seek
to
so
adjust
their
rates
as
to
bring
their
schedules
within
the
rulings
of
that
tribunal
the
committee
believes
the
highest
duty
of
the
commission
is
to
bring
together
shippers
and
carriers
to
the
end
that
each
may
see
that
neither
can
be
permanently
prosperous
at
the
expense
of
the
other
it
further
believes
that
in
many
instances
this
effort
has
been
made
by
the
commission
and
successfully
made
it
can
not
be
accomplished
by
statutes
causing
rigidity
of
rates
the
most
sensitive
spot
in
the
great
business
dealings
of
the
country
is
the
railroad
rate
this
rate
must
be
raised
or
lowered
not
in
obedience
to
a
rigid
statutory
law
but
in
obedience
to
the
varying
conditions
of
trade
and
commerce
the
national
board
of
trade
one
of
the
most
important
commercial
organizations
in
the
country
and
one
of
the
most
influential
met
in
washington
on
tuesday
january
two
proposed
resolutions
were
submitted
to
that
convention
first
by
the
philadelphia
press
league
urging
an
amendment
to
the
interstate
commerce
law
to
permit
railroads
engaged
in
interstate
traffic
to
enter
into
the
making
of
agreements
under
the
supervision
and
control
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
second
proposition
was
submitted
by
the
scranton
board
of
trade
embodying
the
provisions
of
the
amendment
offered
in
the
committee
upon
the
consideration
of
senate
bill
and
approved
in
the
report
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
to
the
advance
of
rates
these
resolutions
were
referred
to
the
committee
on
resolutions
having
charge
of
interstate
commerce
matters
that
committee
through
its
chairman
made
the
following
report
which
was
unanimously
indorsed
by
the
convention
of
the
national
board
of
trade
the
committee
on
interstate
commerce
law
respectfully
reports
that
in
its
judgment
the
national
board
of
trade
ought
not
at
this
time
to
recommend
any
change
in
the
laws
relating
to
interstate
commerce
the
convention
was
not
satisfied
with
the
passage
of
this
resolution
but
the
chairmen
of
the
several
committees
of
that
association
were
subsequently
authorized
and
directed
by
resolution
to
urge
the
conclusions
of
the
board
in
its
name
whenever
possible
the
country
is
now
demanding
repose
in
its
industrial
upbuilding
it
is
not
a
time
to
experiment
and
to
change
the
basis
upon
which
the
former
acts
to
regulate
commerce
have
been
predicated
the
recent
law
passed
by
congress
so
greatly
enlarging
the
authority
of
the
commission
should
before
changes
are
sought
have
the
opportunity
of
at
least
a
fair
trial
as
to
the
value
of
its
provisions
in
the
regulation
of
interstate
commerce
when
trial
has
been
given
and
normal
conditions
have
been
restored
any
defect
in
the
regulating
statute
can
then
in
the
light
of
experience
be
promptly
remedied

is

reveals
the
common
source
of
both
sets

and
gives
the
key
to
the
discrepancy
between
them
this
is
no
less
than
the
inclusion
in

from

which
are
excluded
from

in
which

only
from

is

and
added
to

the
impropriety
and
inaccuracy
of
such
accounting
becomes
manifest
when
its
effect
is
seen
to
vary

grossly
exaggerated

these
are
venial
variations

to
the
deliberate
misrepresentation
as
to
dividends
on
page
of
the
report
where
it
is
stated
the
amount
of

declared
during
the
year
was
being
equivalent
to
per
cent
on
stock
for
the
year
ending

the
amount
of

declared
was
this
statement
is
the
more
reprehensible
because
the
inaccuracy
of
the
reference
to
dividends
in
was
exposed
a
year
ago
and
of
the
total
is
proved
to
be
fictitious
by
the
line
in
the
condensed
income
statement
of
the
report
page
reading
dividends
declared
from
current
income
it
takes
dividends
from
surplus
dividends
by
leased
companies
and
dividends
from
surplus
of
leased
companies
to
make
up
that
gross
deception
as
to
the
dividends
declared
in
and
all
these
several
dividends
are
only
made
statistically
possible
by
including
in
current
income
other
income
not
derived
from
transportation
it
is
impossible
to
overestimate
the
harmful
popular
effect
of
exaggerating
the
dividends
paid
by
the
railways
by
in
and
in
the
public
mind
does
not
stop
to
distinguish
between
dividends
declared
dividends
paid
out
of
income
and
net
dividends
actually
paid
out
of
net
earnings
of
railway
traffic
this
whole
statistical
structure
of
fictitious
dividends
has
been
built
up
in
successive
reports
upon
the
false
premise
of
including
intercorporate
payments
on
both
sides
of
the
income
account
what
the
public
is
entitled
to
know
is
the
disposition
of
the
gross
sum
paid
by
it
for
transportation
services
those
services
which
the
act
to
regulate
commerce
was
passed
to
regulate
bewildering
changes
in
nomenclature
scattered
through
the
official
reports
for
the
student
is
confronted
with
numerous
changes
in
terminology
many
of
which
are
for
the
better
but
nearly
all
impair
that
continuity
of
names
and
phrases
which
is
so
desirable
in
comparative
statistics
for
instance
the
public
has
been
taught
by
official
practice
to
speak
of
the
revenues
of
the
railways
derived
from
the
transportation
of
passengers
freight
mail
and
express
as
gross
earnings
from
operation
the
phrase
is
descriptive
definite
and
clear
for
this
the
commission
has
substituted
rail
operations
operating
revenues
former
reports
spoke
of
income
from
operation
which
now
gives
place
to
net
operating
revenue
to
this
is
added
the
net
revenue
from
outside
operations
making
a
total
net
revenue
from
which
taxes
accrued
are
deducted
the
remainder
being
operating
income
it
will
be
perceived
that
this
last
phrase
which
covers
revenues
from
which
operating
expenses
and
taxes
have
been
deducted
and
to
which
the
net
revenues
from
outside
operations
sometimes
they
involve
a
deficit
have
been
added
comes
perilously
near
the
income
from
operation
of
preceding
reports
the
exclusion
of
the
reports
from
switching
and
terminal
companies
in
some
instances
while
they
are
included
in
others
introduces
an
element
of
perplexing
uncertainty
at
every
turn
and
really
vitiates
all
comparisons
with
former
reports
the
commission
itself
seems
to
realize
the
bog
into
which
the
official
statistician
has
plunged
its
accounts
when
it
says
the
changes
in
the
income
account
submitted
in
the
report
under
consideration
so
far
reaching
in
their
in
a
number
of
instances
as
to
impair
direct
or
close
comparison
with
figures
for
similar
items
in
previous
statistical
reports
and
now
it
is
proposed
to
throw
all
the
accumulated
statistics
of
years
out
of
consecutive
gear
by
substituting
the
calendar
for
the
fiscal
year
the
writer
has
deemed
the
foregoing
comments
necessary
to
clear
the
atmosphere
before
proceeding

of
the

and
of
the
drastic

emergency
can
be
read
in
the

the

for
the

was
and
the
shadow
of
approaching
trouble
was
shown
in
an
increase
of
this
ratio
to
for
the
first
six
months
in
the
table
by
december
this
ratio
had
risen
to
the
enormous
receipts
of
the
autumn

held
the
ratio
for
the
six

down
to
in

it
marked
the
high
and
ruinous
figure
of
and
from
that
point
the
trend
due
to
severe
retrenchments
was
steadily
downward
until
it
touched
in

the
ratio
of
for
the
second
half
of
is
the
true
measure
of
the
ability
of
the
railways
to
cut
their
expenditures
to
fit
the
times
but
they
were
on
bed
rock
as
the
succeeding
months
of
small
receipts
proved
when
the
ratio
went
up
to
in
january
and
averaged
the
high
figure
of
for
the
first
six

of
the
heavy

of
october
and
november
without
a
corresponding
expansion
of

resulted
in
the
phenomenally
low

of
these

but
the
severity
and
necessities
of
operating
conditions
in
december
ran
the
ratio
of
expenses
up
to
the
net
earnings
for
the
three
years
under
consideration
are
apt
to
lead
to
erroneous
conclusions
as
to
the
effect
of
the
depression
neither
the
loss
in
nor
the
recovery
in
reflects
the
true
swing
of
the
pendulum
the
one
minimizes
the
loss
because
it
conceals
the
cessation
of
all
constructive
work
the
curtailment
of
betterments
and
improvements
and
the
postponement
of
all
purchases
for
replacements
except
of
the
most
immediate
and
imperative
nature
the
other
exaggerates
the
recovery
because
of
heavy
receipts
without
the
resumption
of
the
concurrent
expenditures
that
should
attend
them
the
railways
in
the

in

of

today
the
railways
of
the

are
cribb
cabin
and
confined
in
their
services
to
the
american
people
not
so
much
by
the
laws
for
their
regulation
as
by
the
spirit
in
which
those
laws
are
administered
to
the
general
tenor
and
purposes
of
statutory
regulation
the
railways
have
become
largely
reconciled
but
from
the
spirit
in
which
the
laws
are
sought
to
be
enforced
there
has
to
be
continuous
appeal
to
the
courts
and
to
the
public
sense
of
justice
regulation
of
railways
has
been
persistently
interpreted
by
political
commissions
to
spell
reduction
of
rates
and
exacting
conditions
that
would
drain
the
purse
of
fortunatus
between
when
the
interstate
commerce
commission
statistics
first
became
a
valuable
index
of
railway
operation
and
the
average
rate
per
ton
mile
has
fallen
from
to
mills
on
the
freight
tonnage
of
this
meant
a
reduction
of
over
in
the
yearly
revenues
of
the
railways
the
railways
suffered
that
loss
from
their
income
when
they
needed
every
cent
of
it
to
maintain
the
people
highway
in
a
condition
to
transport

the

lost
it
but
who
got
it
the
people
search
the
market
reports
of
the
land
from
eastport
to
san
diego
and
you
will
find
incontestable
proof
that
not
one
cent
of
these
millions
reached
the
pockets
of
the
people
in
whose
name
all
regulation
of
railways
is
demanded
and
for
whose
benefit
all
reductions
are
claimed
the
average
rate
on
all
commodities
has
gone
down
the
price
of
every
commodity
transported
by
the

has
gone
up
who
has
pocketed
the
difference
there
can
be
only
one
answer
the
producers
the
shippers
and
the
traders
today
of
the
increased
cost
of
living
in
the
united
states
is
chargeable
to
this
ever
vigilant
and
aggressive
coalition
for
everything
the
railways
must
buy
labor
supplies
money
they
have
to
pay
the
advanced
prices
of
the
day
but
the
protests
of
the
shippers
and
the
rulings
of
the
commission
forbid
their
raising
a
rate
or
adopting
a
economy
they
attempted
to
readjust
freight
rates
in
of
a
cent
per
ton
mile
above
a
ruinously
low
average
and
the
outraged
shippers
secured
the
passage
of
the
hepburn
act
how
the
federal
commission
and
shippers
work
together
for
the
regulation
of
the
railways
is
evidenced
in
the
unbroken
tenor
of
the
decisions
handed
down
by
the
commission

of
decisions
printed
during
the

no
less
than

the

to
imagine
the
range
of
their
respective
pettiness
or
portentous
possibilities
it
is

if
the
american

or
even
the
interstate

commissioners
themselves
realize
how
the
formal
decisions

informal
orders
of

are
slowly

surely
whittling
away

safe
margin
of

railway

at
the
rate
of
two

every
three
days
and
forty
informal

the
work
of
incipient
confiscation
proceeds
with
remorseless
enthusiasm
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
the
present
interstate

commission
is
so
enmeshed
in
its
own
traditions
so
enamored
of
the
administrative
control
theories
of
its
statistician
so
covetous
of
unbridled
irresponsible
authority
to
tear
down
where
it
has
no
constructive
capacity
that
anything
like
between
the
commission
and
the
railway
management
for
the
public
good
seems
out
of
the
question
to
the
writer
it
appears
that
only
blind
rejection
of
facts
can
find
any
conserving
element
in
the
regulation
of
railways
as
at
present
administered
signs
of
a
helpful
disposition
in
official
acts
are
entirely
lacking
the
senate
and
house
calendars
groan
under
bills
for
the
further
regulation
and
restriction
of
the
railways
but
not
one
contains
a
promise
of
relief
for
not
one
is
there
a
genuine
public
demand
and
what
is
the
situation
as
this
is
written
it
can
be
stated
in
a
few
lines
as
a
consequence
of
the
drop
of
in
gross
earnings
in
the
railways
in
and
cut
out
of
their
expenditures
this
was
done
mainly
at
the
expense
of
maintenance
of
way
and
structures
and
in
a
cessation
in
the
purchase
of
equipment
but
the
economies
of
postponed
expenditures
permeated
every
line
of
railway
extension
operation
and
replacement
in
with
more
miles
of
track
to
maintain
less

spent

less
was
expended

and
the
expenditures
for
maintenance
of
way
increased
from
to
or
over
this
means
an
increase
of
approximately
a
year
or
at
least
on
present
plant
therefore
at
least
was
withheld
from
this
essential
line
of
railway
maintenance
in
and
fully
in
a
total
of
the
saving
on

nearly
as

dealt
with

now

this
should
be
so
with
no
reduction
in

the

a

adjusted
is
to
be
met
out
of

only
an
advance
in

can
take
care

if
out
of
fresh

it
can
only
be
coaxed
from
the

that
discount
the
risk
attendant

it

proposed
to

thus

what

wholly

as
presented

as
an
admirable

throw
little

in

the

this
omission
in

essential

the

from

have
been

were

almost
a

earlier

the

has
been
delayed
in
order
to
make
the
usual
comparisons
with

for
the
writer
is
advised
from
washington
that
the
fault
for
this
unusual
delay
rests
with
the
government
printer
whose
office
is
overwhelmed
with
congressional
and
departmental
work
and
not
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
its
bureau
of
statistics
and
accounts
for
the
first
time
the
reports
to
this

cover
the
division
of

into
the

chief

the

of

from

and
the

it
is
believed
that
with
the
addition
of
these
accounts
the

of
the

has
become
so
comprehensive
as
to
warrant
its

hereafter

an
earlier

without
waiting
on
the

of

this

the

has
received

and
carrying

the

represents
the
actual
increase
of
railway
mileage
in
the
united

for
the
twelve
months
in
presenting
these

the
writer
has
endeavored
to
make
them
as
colorless
summaries
of
facts
as
an
earnest
desire
to
arrive
at
the
truth
permits
such
comment
as
accompanies
them
will
be
confined
to
comparisons
and
elucidation
and
not
to
the
furtherance
of
any
personal
theories
for
the
sake
of
brevity
the

be
referred

the

wishes
to
record
his
personal
appreciation
of
the
assistance
rendered
by
the
executives
and
accounting
officials
of
the
railways
whose
has
made
this
report
possible
in
the
midst
of
increasing
burdens
imposed
on
them
in
reporting
to
federal
and
state
commissions
and
legislatures
the
requests
for
information
from
this
bureau
might
have
seemed
excusably
negligible
the
completeness
of
the
report
itself
testifies
to
the
cordiality
with
which
the
bureau
work
is
viewed
acknowledgments
are
also
due
to
federal
and
state
officials
for
their
uniform
courtesy
in
responding
to
the
many
requests
from
this
bureau
and
the
writer
has
been
much
gratified
to
receive
from
the
chief
government
railway
official
of
one
foreign
country
the
assurance
that
he
considers
its
annual

one
of

the

student
the

in
the

europe
of
one

five
is
as
apparent
as
it
is
significant
of
our
necessity
for
so
much
greater
provision
of
transportation
facilities
per
capita
if
our
per
capita
mileage
were
relatively
the
same
as
that
of
europe
the

would
be
set
back
to
the
transportation
facilities
of
when
the
completion
of

pacific
raised
its

to
miles
but
even
then
it
had
a
ratio
of
one
mile
of
railway
to
inhabitants
which
was
higher
than
europe
ratio
today
clearly
there
is
nothing
in
the
statistics
of
the
railway
mileage
of
the
world
to
account
for
the
epidemic
of
railway
phobia
that
periodically
convulses
the
people
and

of
the

of
america
mileage
of
all

in

almost
equal
importance
to
the

of

the

the

the

it
is
this
continuous
demand
for
increased
mileage
and

in
the
united

to
say
nothing
of
equipment
that
differentiates
the
problem
confronting
american
railway
management
from
british
in
the

we
need
more
railways
and
still
more
railways
and
the
problem
is
to
get
the
capital
on
reasonable
terms
to
provide
the
facilities
in

alone
we
have
over
ten
times
that
of
the

and
we
have
more
than
six
times
as
many

of

we
have
enough
trackage
in
our
yards

to
double
track
all
the
british

with
enough

put

they
have
only

an

lesson
in

no
car
shortage
occurred
to
interrupt
the
orderly
movement
of
railway
traffic
during
the
fiscal
year
on
the
contrary
there
was
an
unprofitable
surplus
of
cars
throughout
the
year
ranging
from
in
september
to
in
january
from
this
high
figure
the
surplus
was
slowly
reduced
by
the
demands
of
traffic
until
subsequent
to
the
close
of
the
fiscal
year
in
september
last
it
reached
a
practical
level
of
shortages
and
surpluses
during
the
year
there
was
an
average
of
freight
cars
in
the

where
in
times
of
ordinary
activity
the
mean
would
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
these
conditions
which
prevailed
since

account
for
the
greatly
reduced

it

the

out
the

that

barely
sufficient
to

the

however
was
in

measure
made
good
by
the
greater

of
the

as
the
average

the

show
that
the

has
been
in

of

in

the

these

are
the
delight
of
demagogues
and
other
detractors
of
american
railways
who
ignore
or
have
never
been
able
to
comprehend
that
the
average
performance
of
a
car
per

depends
from
six
to
nine
times
more
on
the
time
allowed
for
shippers
to
load
and
unload
cars
than
on
its
speed
in
transit
this
speed
runs
all
the
way
from
ten
to
forty
miles
and
over
an
hour
but
if
freight
trains
averaged
miles
an
hour
it
would
make
little
impression
on
the
per

average
of
cars
so
long
as
hours
has
to
be
allowed
as
a
minimum
at
either
end
for
loading
and
unloading
and
almost
as
much
more
for
placing
notices
and
disposing
of
cars
to
say
nothing
of
time
consumed
in
making
up

the
salient
and
significant
feature
of
this
table
is
the
proof
it
affords
that
each
car
of
those
in
commission
averages
the
movement
of
one
ton
miles
per
day
this
means
an
average

of

it

during

with
a

that
again
have
been
found
to
possess
enough
merit
to
warrant
the

in
conducting
further
tests
it
finds
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
proposed

are
unsound
either
in
principle
or
design
with
regard
to
some
form
of

the
board
says
that
it
is
not
yet
prepared
to
make
a
definite
and
positive
recommendation
but
it
thinks
it
reasonable
to
expect
that
several
forms
of
automatic
train
controlling
devices
will
be
found
available
for
use
in
this
connection
it
very
sensibly
concludes
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
trials
or
tests
conducted
by
the
government
will
independently
of
extended
use
by
railways
result
in
the
production

shown
that
these

employ
over

the

the

earned
by
railway
employes
from
which
it
appears
that
the
employes
of
all
the

in
numbered
whose
compensation
for
that
year
was
approximately
this
would
show
an
increase
of
men
employed
and
a
decrease
of
in
compensation
a
discrepancy
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
pay
roll
in
june
was
numerically
at
low
tide
while
the
aggregate
compensation
was
swelled
by
the
large
pay
rolls
of
the
first
six

of
the
fiscal
year
the
conditions
were
nearly
reversed
in
for
the

at
the
ebb
during
the
first
half
of
the
year
whereas
the
number
on
it
did
not
begin
to
show
the
demands
of
increasing
traffic
until
the
very
close
of
the
fiscal

these

would
be
more

if
the

throughout

and
not
as

the

of

to
substitute
december

the

the

from
these

a

idea
is
gained
of
the

they
support
the
statement
that

the

but
whether
the
decrease
was
due
to
a
reduction
in
pay
or
in
numbers
employed
can
not
be
told
as
there
has
been
no

of

in

has
been
made
the
fulcrum
on
which
every
lever
to
advance
wages
works
is
it
proper
to
refer
to
the
subject
in
this
report
now
there
is
nothing
in
the
whole
wilderness
of
economics
so
utterly
illusive
and
misleading
as
this
same
cost
of
living
it
is
as
incapable
of
statistical
expression
as
the
airy
imaginings
of
a
dream
and
yet
it
broods
over
the
domestic
happiness
of
nations
with
all
the
disquieting
effects
of
a
nightmare
and
like
every
nightmare
it
comes
from
eating
too
much
and
wanting
to
eat
more
in
economics
beyond
the
barest
subsistence
the
cost
of
living
is
not
ruled
by
necessity
but
by
individual
choice
each
person
and
family
settles
it
along
the
lines
of
abstinence
or
indulgence
it
ranges
from
the
dinner
of
herbs
where
love
is
and
the
virtues
of
are
nourished
to
the
feasts
of
lucullus
and
pompeian
profligacy
in
whose
indulgence
whole
peoples
have
perished
in
every
discussion
of
the
subject
first
consideration
is
given
to
the
price
of
food
this
amounts
to
measuring
the
cost
of
living
with
an
elastic
string
the
proportion
of
the
cost
of
food
to
the
cost
of
living
varies
in
every
land
in
every
occupation
and
in
every
household
it
amounts
to
less
than
in
an
average
american
family
but
each
family
fixes
it
for
itself
following
certain
well
recognized
economic
laws
the
percentage
for
subsistence
increases
as
the
income
decreases
for
instance
in
france
families
with
an
income
of
under
per
week
spend
of
it
for
food
alone
whereas
those
with
a
week
spend
in
england
families
averaging
a
week
spend
on
food
while
those
of
spend
or
less
in
germany
a
similar
inquiry
showed
that
families
with
an
average
income
of
per
week
spent
on
food
excluding
beer
or
with
beer
whereas
families
with
an
income
of
per
week
spent
less
than
on
food
excluding
beer
the
exhaustive
investigation
made
by
commissioner
carroll
wright
when
head
of
the
bureau
of
labor
in
anticipated
for
the
united
states
these
results
of
more
recent
european
inquiries
as
appears
from
the
following
table
showing
the
per
cent
of
total
expenditure
made
for
various
purposes
in
normal
families
according
to
classified
incomes
per

or

or

or

or
over
all
classes
while
it
is
scarcely
believable
that
many
american
families
with
incomes
under
spent
less
than
a
year
on
food
the
european
percentage
in
such
cases
being
more
credible
there
is
no
reason
to
question
the
general
economic
law
reflected
in
this
table
that
the
proportion
of
income
spent
on
food
diminishes
as
the
income
increases
but
it
is
governed
more
by
individual
tendencies
character
and
taste
than
by
any
rule
or
principle
each
family
works
out
the
problem
on
its
own
account
according
to
the
evidence
presented
at
recent
arbitration
hearings
in
this
city
american
switchmen
as
a
body
belong
in
the
classes
whose
family
expenditures
are
or
over
irrespective
of
the
incomes
of
other
members
of
their
families
the
arbitrators
found
that
the
actual
monthly
earnings
of
switchmen
in
the
chicago
district
for
those
who
worked
full
time
from
about
to
per
this
means
over
yearly
compensation
therefore
they
are
in
the
class
which
spends
less
than
of
its
income
on
food
the
average
income
for
all
railway
employes
engaged
in
train
service
that
is
enginemen
firemen
conductors
and
other
trainmen
is
probably
above
the
highest
figure
in
the
foregoing
table
and
therefore
the
proportion
of
their
income
spent
for
food
would
be
approximately
but
accepting
as
approximately
the
proportion
of
the
pay
of
all
railway
employes
spent
on
food
it
follows
that
it
takes
only
of
one
per
cent
increase
in
wages
to
take
care
of
an
increase
of
one
per
cent
in
the
price
of
food
with
this
in
mind
it
becomes
instructive
to
follow
the
retail
prices
of
the
various
articles
of
food
as
selected
by
wright
in
his
inquiry
into
the
cost
of
living
in
and
adopted
by
the
bureau
of
labor
in
subsequent
bulletins
these
for
thirty
articles
of
food
for
the
eighteen
years
to
as
given
in
bulletin
no
of
the
bureau
of
labor
and
for
the
two
years
as
computed
from
bradstreet
index
and
other
sources
of
commodity
prices
are
given
in
the
following
statement
relatively
to
the
average
price

no
authority
is
claimed
for
the
prices
in
these
tables
for
the
years
and
they
merely
represent
the
tendencies
in
those
years
as
found
in
official
and
unofficial
wholesale
prices
of
the
several
commodities
and
there
are
often
striking
divergences
between
wholesale
and
retail
prices
over
short
periods
eventually
they
follow
the
same
course
although
not
always
in
the
same
proportion
now
let
us
see
how
the
average
retail
price
of
these
articles
of
food
compares
with
the
average
daily
pay
of
the
four
representative
classes
of
railway
employes
in
train
service
for
the
ten
years
to
average
daily
compensation
of
other
food
year
firemen
per
cent
increase
here
it
will
be
observed
the
percentage
of
increase
in
the
average
daily
compensation
of
other
trainmen
exceeds
the
relative
increase
in
the
price
of
food
that
of
firemen
almost
equals
it
while
that
of
enginemen
and
conductors
is
below
it
by
approximately
points
but
as
demonstrated
in
the
table
from
the
eighteenth
annual
report
of
the
commissioner
of
labor
a
smaller
percentage
of
the
income
of
enginemen
and
conductors
is
spent
on
food
than
of
those
employes
receiving
lower
pay
moreover
as
only
of
all
expenditures
is
spent
on
food
an
increase
of
in
wages
would
take
care
of
a
advance
in
the
average
price
of
food
provided
the
increase
in
wages
was
not
attended
by
a
corresponding
increase
in
every
other
item
entering
into
the
cost
of
living
and
right
here
the
rub
with
any
attempt
to
measure
wages
by
the
cost
of
living
which
is
the
egg
and
which
is
the
hen
in
the
matter
of
precedence
does
the
cost
of
living
lay
the
income
or
does
the
income
hatch
the
cost
of
living
economically
and
theoretically
it
is
not
up
to
the
railways
to
solve
this
world
old
conundrum
practically
they
are
called
on
to
meet
every
advance
in
the
cost
of
living
of
their
employes
to
which
in
twenty
years
they
have
not
added
a
nickel
and
they
are
denied
the
privilege
enjoyed
by
every
other
employer
of
labor
to
add
its
increased
cost
to
the
price
of
their
only
commodity
or
service
transportation
today
the
advances
in
the
scale
of
railway
wages
awarded
proposed
and
demanded
mean
an
increase
of
from
to
in
the
annual
cost
of
living
of
the
railways
the
advance
made
in
added
to
the
pay
roll
of
combined
these
two
advances
within
three
years
mean
an
increase
of
approximately
a
year
to
the
operating
expenses
of
the
railways
without
adding
a
single
unit
to
efficiency
of
the
labor
factor
in
railway
operation
is
equal
to
an
annual
first
charge
of
on
imagine
the
hue
and
cry
from
the
press
the
immediate
injunctions
from
washington
the
despondent
wail
from
wall
street
if
the
railways
proposed
to
pour
that
much
water
into
their
own
cost
of
living
without
getting
a
mile
of
track
a
single
engine
car
or
coach
a
cubic
yard
of
ballast
one
untreated
tie
or
any
semblance
of
improvement
or
new
facility
to
show
for
the
vast
expenditure
and
yet
the
railways
have
their
increased
cost
of
living
to
meet
just
as
the
rest
of
us
nothing
they
need
and
must
have
can
be
purchased
at
the
prices
of
a
few
years
back
when
you
mention
steel
rails
you
have
named
about
the
only
railway
necessity
that
has
not
advanced
its
cost
of
living
in
recent
years
and
the
railways
have
to
buy
rails
where
five
years
ago
rails
sufficed
and
ten
years
ago
pounds
was
heavy
enough
for
the
lighter
cars
and
engines
of
the
time
but
at
the
first
suggestion
of
advancing
rates
to
meet
advancing
prices
of
commodities
the
commissions
were
overwhelmed
with
protests
from
shippers
and
the
paring
of
freight
rates
down
went
on
as
the
prices
of
the
goods
they
carried
went
up
in
ten
years
the
price
of
lumber
advanced
nearly
as
a
cheap
bulky
commodity
it
had
enjoyed
a
low
rate
in
order
to
move
it
and
it
was
moved
at
the
expense
of
other
commodities
when
it
was
able
to
pay
a
little
more
toward
the
cost
of
getting
it
to
market
the
proposal
of
an
advance
was
met
with
indignant
protests
from
lumber
shippers
and
dealers
and
reversed
thumbs
by
the
sympathetic
commissions
the
railways
pay
more
for
their
lumber
and
other
material
today
than
they
did
ten
years
ago
but
they
will
have
to
fight
for
any
advance
in
rates
to
meet
this
part
of
their
cost
of
living
it
is
said
to
be
a
poor
rule
that
will
not
work
both
ways
but
the
cost
of
living
seems
to
have
only
one
way
of
working
so
far
as
railway
economics
are
concerned
just
as
a
straw
to
indicate
that
high
prices
of
food
are
the
result
and
not
the
basis
of
high
wages

the
amazing
feature
of
this
statement
is
that
the
united
states
produces
and
exports
to
the
united
kingdom
enormous
quantities
of
breadstuffs
meat
and
provisions
which
constitute
the
chief
articles
of
food
in
london
and
which
are
sold
there
at
prices
from
to
lower
than
in
new
york
clearly
it
is
the
high
scale
of
wages
that
fosters
the
high
cost
of
living
in
the
united
states
and
there
can
be
little
question
but
it
breeds
the
high
wages
it
feeds
on
it
is
humanly
certain
though
economically
unsound
that
wages
will
continue
to
advance
with
the
cost
of
living
and
will
not
recede
proportionately
as
prices
of
food
fall
but
both
will
decline
together
when
for
any
considerable
period
there
is
a
surplus
of
efficient
labor
for
the
requirements
of
american
industry
even
railway
labor
in
the
most
stable
of
all
employments
yielded
to
this
influence
in
and
and
the
prices
of
food
receded
to
the
low
mark
in
the
following
years
and
not
until
wages
took
their
upward
turn
in
did
the
cost
of
food
begin
to
show
above
the
index
average
of
iv
capitalization
according
to
the
annual
report
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
the
amount
of
railway
capital
including
stocks
and
bonds
outstanding
in
the
hands
of
the
public
on
june
was
which
if
assigned
on
a
mileage
basis
shows
a
capitalization
of
per
mile
of
line
in
the
face
of
all
the
fustian
about
of
american
railways
this
is
a
most
remarkable
admission
not
only

of

in

found
that
as
the

the

for

capital
outstanding
in

measuring

reduced
the

from

to

course
there
was
never
any
justification
for
using
the
larger
sum
as
a
true

it
was
known
to
contain
at

duplicated

in

the

gave
the
net

of

outstanding
in

of

at
that

assigned
on

or
more
than
the

the

this
would
indicate
a
shrinkage

it
is
needless
to
say
there
was
no
such

the

this

arrive
at

the

this
in

furnishes

the

nearly
to

this

an

the

alone
involves
an
expenditure
of
nearly
annually
physical

of
the

it
is
worthy
of
passing
note
that
just
as
the
railway
companies
have
shown
their
indifference
to
a
physical
valuation
of
their

the
clamor
of
regulators

agitators
in
its
favor
has
subsided
the
proposal
lost
its
attractiveness
to
them
the
moment
they
became
convinced
that
such
an
investigation
would
put
a
valuation
on
the
roads
so
high
as
to
take
not
only
the
wind
out
of
their
sails
but
the
last
drop
of
water
out
of
their
mouths
the
only
insistent
demand
for
this
futile
undertaking
comes
from
quarters
interested
in

of
several
millions
it
would
cost
credit
for
the
reversal
in
the
popular
and
political
attitude
on
this
subject
is
largely
due
to
the
valuations
attempted
by
the
states
of
minnesota
washington
and
wisconsin
the

even

a

light
on

subject
that
in
his
speech
before
the
traffic
club
of
chicago
last
february
he
said
that
he
would
not
be
willing
to
make
a
present
valuation
of
railroad
property
a
basis
for
determining
rates
for
the
reason
that
it
was
more
than
probable
that
the
present
capitalization
of
between
fifteen
and
sixteen
billions
would
be
increased
to
twenty
billions
in
the
bureau
statistics
for
it
was
said
if
the
valuations
in
minnesota
and
washington
made
by
none
too
friendly
commissions
are
any
criterions
of
what
a
national
valuation
made
under
presumably
unbiased
federal
authority
would
be
the
present
cost
to
reproduce
the
railways
of
the

would
be
nearer
than
any

it
would
demonstrate
that

the

takes

upon
what
they
do

the

upon

depends
the

in
considering
the
public
service
of
the

it
is
customary
to
give
first
attention
to
the
passenger
traffic
this
is
not
because
it
is
the
most
important
branch
of
the
service
but
because
passengers
are
numbered
by
millions
where
thousands
suffice
in
the
enumeration
of
the
shippers
who
frequently
mistake
themselves
for
the
entire
american
people
in
twenty
years
between
june
and

the
population
of
the
united
states
increased
from
to
or
nearly
in
the
meantime
the
passenger
cars
provided
by
the
railways
increased
from
to
or
over
but
this
does
not
measure
the
liberal
provision
made
by
the
railway
for
the
travelling
public
which
is
more
fully
and
accurately
expressed
by
the
amazing
growth
of
the
number
of
passengers
carried
one
mile
from
in
to
approximately
in

nearly
here
is
shown
an
increase
of
cars
not
far
short
of
double
the
increase
in
population
and
an
increase
in
passengers
carried
proportionately
greater
than
the
numerical
increase
in
cars
in
the
meantime
the
average
receipts
of
the
traffic
have
declined
from

decline

the

except
as

in

sections
was
unremunerative
in

is
more
so
now
it
is
maintained
at
the

here
it

but
more
significant
than
this
is
the
column
of
yearly

by

this
utterly
explodes
the
theory
that
passenger
travel
is
greatly
stimulated
by
low
fares
aside
from
some
positive
incentive
to
increased
travel
such
as
periodical
expositions
the
louisiana

exposition
for
instance
the
effect
of
which
is
clearly
traceable
in
the
increased

the

of
heavy

to

the
passenger
laws
were
passed
so
as
to
become
generally
effective

and
their
effect
on
passenger

during
the

was
such
that
these

were
actually
less

than

although
the

was

had
the

in

that
of
in

marks
the
progress
in
density
of
that
traffic
which
may
eventually
place
it
on
a
profitable
basis
in
massachusetts
where
this
density
yields
an
average

to
a

there
is
no
demand
for
a

statute
for
the
conditions
have
made
a
rate
of
cents
profitable
in
the
group
of
states
consisting
of
ohio
indiana
michigan
illinois
iowa
wisconsin
and
minnesota
where
the
density
of
traffic
yields
only
passengers
by
train
a
statutory
fare
becomes
confiscatory
because
it
costs
at
least
one
dollar
to
operate
a
passenger
train
one
mile
and
times
two
cents
is
only
cents
moreover
the
passengers
per
train
is
only
an
average
and
there
are
as
many
trains
that
average
less
as
more
the
average
has
to
be
raised
above
to
yield
any
margin
of
profit
on
passenger
traffic
if
it
were
not
for
the
density
of
traffic
in
the
new
england
and
north
atlantic
group
of
states
the
average
for
the
entire
united
states
would
be
well
below
passengers
per
train
the
steady
increase
in
the
distance
traveled
per
passenger
reflects
the
effect
of
trolley
competition
in
diverting
the
short
haul
passenger
traffic
the
most
noteworthy
feature
of
the
seventh
column
is
the
decline
of
of
a
cent
in
the
average
receipts
per
passenger
mile
between
and
making
a
new
low
record
after
hovering
around
the
two
cent
mark
for
fourteen
years
as
noted
above
this
reduction
in
the
average
cost
the
railways
nearly
on
the
passenger
traffic
of
in
this
connection
it
is
interesting
to
recall
that
between
and
the
official
statistician
then
as
now
professor
adams
made
the
following
computation
of
the
average
cost
of
carrying
one
passenger
one
mile
for
the
whole
united
states
average
cost
of
carrying
a
passenger
one
mile
cents
it
will
be
observed
that
the
average
receipts
per
passenger
mile
in
are
below
the
computed
cost
in
every
one
of
the
years
above
named
except
when
the
advance
in
the
cost
of
everything
necessary
to
the
service
track
labor
equipment
conveniences
speed
terminal
facilities
is
considered
the
practical
coincidence
of
average
cost
and
receipts
leaves
no
margin
for
legitimate
profits
receipts
from
mail
and
express
closely
associated
with
the
passenger
traffic
of
the
railways
are
the
mail
and
express
services
although
principally
carried
by
passenger
trains
each
has
a
special
service
of
its
own
by
mail
and
express
trains
but
all
are
included
under
the
passenger
service
the
receipts
from
these
two
branches
of
the
service
during
the
last
decade
are
shown
in
the
following
statement

of

of

aside
from
the
striking
contrast
in
the
percentages

from
these
two
sources
the
most
significant
feature
of
this
table
is
the
reversal
it
shows
in
their
respective
importance
from
the
railway
revenue
point
of
view
prior
to
carrying
the
mails
brought
larger
if
not
more
profitable
returns
to
the
railways
since
then
the
returns
from
express
have
increased
so
much
more
rapidly
that
they
are
now
nearly
more
than
those
from
mails
if
proof
were
needed
of
the
absolute
falsity
of
the
charge
that
the
railways
are
receiving
an
exorbitant
rate
for
carrying
mail
the
above
table
of
their
receipts
from
the
service
in
connection
with
the

statement

and

in

of
the
finding
of
the
joint
commission
of
congress
in
would
furnish
it
after
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
subject
lasting
from
august
to
july
the
commission
came
to
the
following
conclusion
upon
a
careful
consideration
of
all
the
evidence
and
the
statements
and
arguments
submitted
and
in
view
of
all
the
services
rendered
by
the
railroads
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
prices
now
paid
to
the
railroad
companies
for
the
transportation
of
the
mails
are
not
excessive
and
recommend
that
no
reduction
thereof
be
made
at
this
time
the
increase
in
the
railroad
service
since
this
report
was
made
is
shown
in
the
following
statement
of
miles
of
mail
transportation
by
railroads
the
postal
revenues
and
the
number
of
clerks
in
the
railway

service
since

in
years
per
cent
compared
with
the
increase
of
only
in
the
revenues
from
mail
received
by
the
railways
during
the
same
period
each
one
of
the
above
percentages
testifies
to
a
positive
reduction
in
the
rate
received
by
the
railways
for
the
service
and
if
the
increase
in
weight
of
mail
carried
in
were
known
the
contrast
between
the
service
and
the
pay
would
be
more
striking
in
the
total
weight
of
all
mail
was
reported
as
pounds
in
the
estimates
made
from
the
special
weighing
placed
the
weight
of
mail
carried
that
year
at
pounds
or
an
increase
of
nearly
in
eight
years
by
reference
to
the
above
table
it
will
be
seen
that
the
railway
revenues
from
mail
between
and
increased
only
the
contrast
is
illuminating
in
its
light
the
charge
that
the
railways
are
in
any
way
responsible
for
the
postal

grotesque

to

from

as
being
based
on
the
same
character
of

as
those
from
which
former
ratios
were

the
preponderance
of

of

the
average
proportion

the
nine
years
preceding
is
seen
to
be
slightly
above
and
the
fact
that
it
was
almost
one
point
below
in
and
indicates
that
it
was
the
freight
traffic
that
bore
the
brunt
of
the
business
depression
which
curtailed
railway
revenues
during
those
years
in
no
other
of
the
leading
countries
of
the
world
does
the
freight
traffic
assume
the
overwhelming
relative
proportion
that
it
does

it
would
raise
the

so
far
as

are
concerned
seasons
of
prosperity

and
marking
time
are
alike
to
american
railways
the
burden
of
their
taxation
knows
no
recession
but
mounts
steadily
absolutely
per
mile
and
in
proportion
to
gross

the
roads
reporting

owning

putting
a
conservative
estimate
of

on
the

of

not

would
add
to
the

and
bring
the
aggregate
taxes
paid
by
the
railways
of
the

in
up
to
the
striking
total
of
how
railway
taxation
has
increased
absolutely
and
relatively
to
earnings
and
mileage
during
the
past
years

figures
in

the
figures
for
are
based
on
the
monthly
reports
to
the
commission
and
are
subject
to
revision
but
they
are
in
substantial
agreement
with
the
estimate
on
the
returns
to
the
bureau
observe
that
the
highest
ratio
of
taxes
to
gross
earnings
shown
in
this
table
was
per
cent
in
when
everything
relating
to
railways
except
taxes
was
prostrated
under
the
reign
of
receiverships
that
followed
the
panic
of
it
was
of
that
the
official
statistician
recorded
the
fact
that
per
cent
of
outstanding
stock
paid
no
dividends
and
per
cent
of
outstanding
bonds
exclusive
of
equipment
trust
obligations
paid
no
interest
there
is
instruction
and
warning
behind
the
remarkable
increase
in
the
ratio
of
taxation
shown
in
the
figures
for
to
there
is
the
reflection
of
similar
conditions
in
the
rising
ratios
of
and
x
damages
and
injuries
to
persons
there
are
two
items
in
railway
accounts
connected
with
the
expense
of
operation
that
give
the
management
most
serious
concern
because
no
means
has
been
devised
to
limit
or
control
them
in
a
leaflet
issued
by
this
bureau
in
september
last
it
was
estimated
that
the
payments
of
american
railways
on
account
of
injuries
to
persons
and
loss
and
damage
for
the
year
would
approximate
or
more
than
per
cent
of
their
gross
earnings
the
commission
has
not
yet
made
public
the
final
figures
for
but
the
returns
on
these
accounts
of
the
roads
reporting
to
this
bureau
for
the
year
aggregate
or
per
cent
of
their
gross
earnings
divided
according
to
the
new
system
of
accounting
adopted
by
the
commission
these
returns
show
the
following

total
unlike
many
of
the
other
expenses
of
american
railways
the
burden
of
this
cost
of
operation
does
not
fall
heaviest
on
the
large
systems
in
the
case
of
one
road
of
moderate
importance
payments
on
these
two
accounts
amounting
to
per
cent
of
gross
earnings
were
enough
to
tip
the
balance
into
a
deficit
after
paying
interest
on
funded
debt
one
minor
but
prosperous
road
after
paying
per
cent
of
gross
receipts
to
meet
these
two
accounts
had
nothing
left
for
dividends
after
paying
interest
which
amounted
to
less
than
per
cent
of
its
earnings
and
a
small
third
road
after
being
called
on
to
pay
per
cent
of
its
earnings
for
injuries
and
damages
had
only
per
cent
of
its
operating
revenue
left
to
pay
interest
on
funded
debt
which
called
for
per
cent
of
the
earnings
and
taxes
reduced
the
net
operating
revenue
to
less
than
per
cent
these
are
extreme
cases
but
they
illustrate
how
the
injury
and
damage
claims
strike
roads
that
can
ill
afford
to
pay
them
as
well
as
the
great
systems
which
are
the
common
prey
of
every
claimant
with
enough
of
a
grievance
to
interest
an
attorney
who
scents
a
contingent
fee
that
the
claims
behind
these
expenses
are
largely
meretricious
is
indicated
if
not
proved
by
their
disproportionate
increase
in
the
past
ten
years
during
which
the
railways
have
expended
millions
in
providing
safeguards
for
their

that

almost
more

in
than
it
did
in
the
increase
in

xii
the
safety
of
american
railways
never
before
in
the
history
of
railways
has
such
a
record
for
comparative
safety
been
made
as
that
recorded
of
american
railways
during
the
year
ending
june
following
its
custom
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
published
the
report
of
accidents
it
remains
to
set
forth
here
the
more
remarkable
record
of
safety
of
the
companies
reporting
to
this
bureau
no
less
than
operating
miles
of
line
and
carrying
passengers
went
through
the
year
without
a
single
fatality
to
a
passenger
in
a
train
accident
of
the
remaining
companies
no
less
than
operating
miles
and
carrying
passengers
only
missed
such
perfect
immunity
by
a
single
fatality
each
in
accidents
to
trains
this
leaves
roads
whose
misfortune
it
was
to
bear
the
burden
of
train
accident
fatalities
to
passengers
during
the
year
the
invariable
rule
of
the
bureau
precludes
the
publication
of
the
honor
roll
of
safety
and
it
is
well
so
for
it
would
lead
to
invidious
comparisons
where
in
such
matters
as
accidents
all
comparisons
are
as
irrelevant
as
they
are
invidious
but
it
may
be
stated
that
the
roll
of
immunity
includes
roads
in
every
section
of
the
union
from
maine
to
california
several
great
systems
operating
over
miles
of
line
each
as
well
as
little
branch
lines
of
below
ten
miles
of
single
track
lines
operated
with
all
the
safety
appliances
known
to
twentieth
century
progress
and
lines
operated
under
as
primitive
conditions
as
prevailed
on
this
continent
more
than
half
a
century
ago
this
record
of
complete
immunity
stretching
over
miles
of
operated
line
represents
a
mileage
nearly
seven
times
that
of
all
british
roads
and
equals
the
aggregate
of
all
europe
excluding
russia
but
including
the
british
isles
what
immunity
to
fatalities
to
passengers
over
such
a
vast
mileage
means
may
be
partly
realized
from
the
fact
that
only
twice
in
half
a
century
has
it
occurred
on
the
miles
of
british
railways
and
never
to
the
writer
knowledge
so
far
as
statistics
reveal
on
the
railways
of
any
of
the
great
divisions
of
europe
certainly
it
has
never
occurred
on
the
aggregate
railways
of
europe
it
would
take
seven
consecutive
years
of
immunity
from
fatalities
to
passengers
in
train
accidents
on
british
railways
to
equal
this
phenomenal
record
of
american
roads
in
presenting
similar
returns
for
it
was
said
that
considering
the
myriad
units
of
risk
involved
the
record
for
immunity
from
fatal
accidents
to
passengers
is
without
parallel
in
the
history
of
railway
operation
how
that
record
has
been
not
only
equalled
but
surpassed
is
shown
in
the
following
statement
for
the
last
two
years
summary
of
mileage
and
traffic
of
roads
on
which
no
passenger
was

proves
that
the
area
of
perfect
safety
so
to
speak
was
extended
over
from
to
more
units
of
risk
in
than
in
which
already
held
the
palm
for
immunity
in

accident

to

equally
illuminating

that

less
by
the
fact
that
no
passenger
is
killed
in

accidents
is
more
or
less
adventitious
but
a
reduction
in
the
number
injured
testifies
to
a
reduction
in

nothing
short
of
a
national
scandal
as
for

in
were
practically
as
well
equipped
as
in
the

operated
under

of

inappreciable
as
compared
with

recorded
difference

the
government
inspectors
reported
the
equipment
in
better
condition
in
than
for
any
previous
year
by
fully
and
yet
that
was
the
worst
year
in
the
annals
of
railway
accidents
an
english
writer
raynor
wilson
his
vision
unobscured
by
the
propinquity
of
patent
devices
has
placed
his
finger
on
the
true
cause
of
the
reduction
in
railway
accidents
in
the
united
states
in
and
when
writing
in
the
safety
of
british
railways
he
says
experience
in
america
during
the
period
of
depression
that
has
prevailed
since
the
summer
of
shows
that
fewer
accidents
occur
during
such
times
there
are
not
so
many
goods
trains
the
men
are
less
they
work
fewer
hours
and
the
careless
and
indifferent
are
weeded
out
but
we
do
not
have
to
go
to
england
for
a
convincing
analysis
of
the
causes
of
the
remarkable
decrease
in
accidents
on
american
railways
in
and
in
the
presence
of
similar
conditions
statistician
adams
in
his
official
report
for
penned
the
following
another
explanation
may
be
suggested
for
this
decrease
in
casualties
to
railway
employes
the
character
of
equipment
used
during
the
year
covered
by
this
report
was
undoubtedly
of
a
higher
grade
than
in
previous
years
a
large
number
of
old
cars
of
abandoned
type
were
destroyed
during
the
year
while
there
was
an
increase
in
the
better
grades
of
cars
equipped
with
train
brakes
and
automatic
couplers
this
however
is
a
suggestion
merely
there
being
no
statistical
proof
of
any
relation
between
a
higher
grade
equipment
and
the
decrease
of
accidents
to
employes
it
is
also
probable
in
view
of
the
fact
that
liability
to
accident
is
increased
by
the
employment
of
the
shiftless
and
unskilled
that
the
grade
of
labor
was
raised
through
the
discharge
of
so
large
a
number
of
employes
this
latter
suggestion
finds
support
in
the
fact
that
the
ratio
of
casualties
in
the
southern
states
where
the
grade
of
labor
is
somewhat
inferior
has
for
a
series
of
years
been
higher
than
in
the
northern
and
eastern
states
with
a
continuation
of
similar
conditions
as
to
traffic
and
labor
throughout
the
official
statistician
having
not
yet
accepted
the
theory
that
violation
of
rules
carelessness
and
negligence
are
amenable
to
patent
appliances
emphasized
the
concluding
suggestion
of
his
report
in
these
terms
from
the
above
comparative
statement
it
is
clear
that
the
year
ending
june
is
more
satisfactory
so
far
as
accidents
are
concerned
than
any
previous
year
reference
was
made
in
last
year
report
to
the
fact
that
the
marked
reduction
in
the
pay
roll
of
the
railways
by
which
the
incompetent
and
inefficient
were
dropped
from
the
railway
service
and
the
consignment
to
the
scrap
heap
of
equipment
worn
out
or
out
of
date
were
largely
responsible
for
the
greater
safety
in
railway
travel
and
railway
employment
shown
by
the
statistics
of
the
year
the
result
of
raising
the
character
of
the
railway
service
and
grade
of
railway
equipment
is
yet
more
marked
during
the
present
year
and
to
this
must
be
added
the
fact
that
the
demands
upon
the
passenger
service
during
the
present
year
have
been
somewhat
decreased
it
is
also
worthy
of
suggestion
although
the
facts
yet
at
command
are
not
adequate
for
confident
assertion
that
the
fitting
of
equipment
with
automatic
devices
is
beginning
to
show
beneficial
results
from
that
year
to
this
the
fitting
of
equipment
with
automatic
devices
has
proceeded
with
uninterrupted
despatch
where
in
only
of
it
was
equipped
with
train
brakes
and
with
automatic
couplers
in
the
commission
reported
equipped
with
train
brakes
and
with
automatic
couplers
in
every
form
of
mechanical
safety
device
the
railway
equipment
of
was
incomparably
better
than
in
and
yet
the
number
of
fatal
accidents
to
employes
in
exceeded
those
in
seven
to
three
and
to
passengers
three
and
to
one
in
the
matter
of
deaths
in
coupling
accidents
alone
are
beneficial
results
traceable
to
automatic
safety
devices
the
character
of
the
men
in
the
service
their
automatic
observance
of
regulations
intelligence
and
alert
devotion
to
duty
are
the
best
preventives
of
railway
accidents
and
the
conditions
prevalent
after
the
panics
of
and
are
conducive
to
these
conditions
it
is
not
likely
however
that
the
american
people
will
welcome
experiences
even
in
homeopathic
doses
such
as
we
knew
in
as
the
cure
for
railway
accidents
but
from
the
lessons
of
every
depression
as
read
in
the
statistics
of
railway
fatalities
the
american
people
have
a
right
to
expect
their
representatives
in
federal
and
state
legislatures
to
learn
that
the
prevention
of
railway
accidents
rests
on
the
intelligence
vigilance
and
experience
of
the
man
and
not
with
the
multiplication
of
devices
automatic
obedience
to
rules
will
prevent
more
accidents
than
all
the
safety
devices
that
cumber
the
shelves
of
the
patent
office

however
is
easier
to
the

be

in
the
darkest
year
in
the
annals
of
american
railway
accidents
attention
is
asked
to
the
apparently
startling
increase
in
injuries
on
british
railways
since
the
increase
is
absolutely
fictitious
having
resulted
from
a
change
in
the
definition
of
a
reportable
accident
and
not
from
any
greater
hazard
in
the
working
of
british
roads
this
confirms
the
objection
expressed
in
the
report
of
the
british
board
of
trade
in
to
any
changes
in
the
form
of
tables
extending
over
a
long
series
of
years
that
admit
of
comparisons
which
any
change
of
form
would
invalidate
if
not
destroy
it
will
be
perceived
that
the
mere
change
in
the
definition
of
what
constitutes
a
reportable
accident
increased
the
number
of
injuries
reported
against
british
railways
fully
this
justifies
the
writer
view
that
comparisons
of
injuries
in
railway
accidents
are
of
little
value
even
the
same
injury
does
not
affect
two
persons
in
the
same
degree
one
hollers
and
cries
for
a
doctor
where
the
other
whistles
and
goes
on
with
his
work
the
inquiries
of
the
board
of
trade
into
the
causes
of
british
railway
accidents
in
confirm
former
findings
that
exclusive
of
train
accidents
in
the
case
of
passengers
they
mostly
arise
from
carelessness
of
the
passengers
themselves
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
vast
majority
of
accidents
to
employes
overwork
and
railway
accidents
at
last
the
statistics
of
the
british
board
of
trade
furnish
what
well
nigh
amounts
to
demonstration
that
long
hours
play
very
little
part
as
an
actual
cause
of
railway
accidents
under
the
statute
the
board
requires
reports
of
all
instances
of
periods
of
duty
in
excess
of
twelve
hours
worked
on
british
railways
for
the

or
this
bears
out
the
opinion
of
a
high
english
official
that
experience
does
not
show
any
close
connection
between
long
hours
and
accidents
the
following
statement
shows
the
relation
of

the

is
due
to
the
notorious
indifference

of

went
shrieking
by
in
all
comparisons
of

it
should
be
remembered
that
our
excess
of

more
than
balance
their

that
nowhere

this

be
through
