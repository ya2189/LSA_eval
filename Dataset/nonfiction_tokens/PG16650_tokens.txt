choosing
a
place
to
live
blessed
indeed
are
they
who
are
free
to
choose
where
and
how
they
shall
live
still
more
blessed
are
they
who
give
abundant
thought
to
their
choice
for
they
may
not
wear
the
sackcloth
of
discomfort
nor
scatter
the
ashes
of
burned
money
taste
and
expedience
most
of
us
have
a
theory
of
what
the
home
should
be
but
it
is
stowed
away
with
the
wedding
gifts
of
fine
linen
that
are
cherished
for
our
permanent
abode
we
believe
in
harmony
of
surroundings
but
after
living
within
a
period
of
ten
years
or
so
in
seven
different
apartments
with
seven
different
arrangements
of
rooms
and
seven
different
schemes
of
decoration
we
lose
interest
in
suiting
one
thing
to
another
harmony
comes
to
mean
simply
good
terms
with
the
janitor
or
if
being
beginners
we
have
some
such
prospect
of
nomadic
living
facing
us
and
we
are
at
all
knowing
we
realize
the
utter
helplessness
of
demonstrating
our
good
taste
purchase
any
bits
of
furniture
that
a
vagrant
fancy
may
fasten
upon
and
give
space
to
whatever
gimcracks
our
friends
may
foist
upon
us
trusting
that
in
the
whirligig
of
removals
the
plush
rocker
the
mission
table
and
the
brass
parlor
stand
may
each
find
itself
in
harmony
with
something
else
at
one
time
or
another
some
day
we
shall
be
freed
from
the
tyranny
of
these
conditions
and
then
responsibilities
but
when
the
time
comes
to
declare
our
independence
of
landlord
and
janitor
or
at
least
to
exchange
existence
in
a
flat
for
life
in
a
rented
cottage
we
find
that
freedom
brings
some
perplexing
responsibilities
as
well
as
its
blessings
even
if
our
hopes
do
not
soar
higher
than
the
rented
house
there
is
at
least
the
desire
for
a
reasonable
permanency
and
we
have
no
longer
the
excuse
of
transitoriness
to
plead
for
our
lack
of
plan
where
the
home
is
to
be
purchased
for
our
very
own
the
test
of
our
individuality
becomes
more
exacting
a
house
has
character
and
some
of
the
standards
that
apply
to
companionship
apply
to
it
in
fact
we
live
with
it
as
well
as
in
it
and
if
we
have
a
saving
conscience
as
to
the
immeasurability
of
home
by
money
standards
we
are
not
to
be
tempted
by
the
veriest
bargain
of
a
house
that
does
not
nearly
represent
our
ideals
to
blunder
here
is
to
topple
over
our
whole
castle
of
hope
renting
buying
or
building
but
the
test
is
most
severe
of
all
when
good
fortune
permits
us
to
choose
locality
site
and
building
plans
and
to
finish
and
furnish
the
house
to
suit
our
tastes
even
though
less
in
accordance
with
our
full
desires
than
with
our
modest
means
now
we
may
bring
out
our
theory
of
living
from
its
snug
resting
place
it
will
need
some
furbishing
up
maybe
to
meet
modern
conditions
but
never
mind
whether
we
mean
to
rent
to
buy
or
to
build
the
problem
of
where
and
what
and
how
is
before
us
as
folk
of
wholesome
desires
we
insist
first
of
all
upon
good
taste
comfort
and
healthfulness
in
our
habitats
and
since
we
may
agree
upon
the
best
way
to
attain
these
essentials
without
ignoring
our
personal
preferences
in
details
we
may
profitably
take
counsel
together
as
to
what
the
new
home
should
be
location
thought
of
a
location
should
begin
with
the
birth
of
the
home
idea
even
if
the
be
not
immediately
available
we
should
not
only
take
sufficient
time
to
study
conditions
and
scheme
carefully
for
the
home
but
must
sagaciously
bear
in
mind
that
where
real
estate
is
in
active
demand
anxiety
to
purchase
stiffens
prices
to
bide
time
may
mean
a
considerable
saving
however
life
as
we
plan
now
to
live
it
is
short
enough
at
most
and
we
should
not
cheat
ourselves
out
of
too
much
immediate
happiness
by
waiting
for
the
opportunity
the
question
of
neighborhood
if
we
decide
to
remain
within
city
limits
is
a
difficult
one
in
most
of
the
larger
places
no
one
can
accurately
foretell
the
future
of
even
the
most
attractive
residence
district
factories
and
business
houses
may
not
obtrude
but
flats
are
almost
sure
to
come
few
cottages
are
being
constructed
in
cities
partly
because
of
lack
of
demand
but
principally
because
they
do
not
pay
sufficient
income
on
the
investment
consequently
the
houses
that
are
to
be
had
are
seldom
modern
sometimes
they
pass
into
the
hands
of
careless
tenants
and
the
neighborhood
soon
shows
deterioration
still
if
we
are
determined
to
remain
in
the
city
and
take
our
chances
it
is
possible
by
careful
investigation
to
discover
congenial
surroundings
many
of
the
essential
tests
of
the
suburban
home
that
we
shall
discuss
hereafter
will
apply
also
to
the
house
in
a
strictly
residence
district
of
a
large
city
practically
all
of
them
to
the
house
in
a
smaller
town
city
or
country
the
chances
are
however
that
we
shall
choose
the
suburb
but
before
we
desert
j
or
whatever
our
shelf
in
the
apartment
building
may
be
we
may
well
remind
ourselves
that
we
are
also
to
desert
some
of
the
things
that
have
made
city
life
enjoyable
for
one
thing
with
all
our
growling
at
the
landlord
we
have
been
able
to
cast
upon
him
many
burdens
that
we
are
now
to
take
upon
ourselves
some
of
our
sarcasms
are
quite
certain
to
come
home
to
roost
the
details
of
purchasing
fuel
of
maintaining
heat
of
making
repairs
are
now
to
come
under
our
jurisdiction
and
we
shall
see
whether
we
manage
these
duties
better
than
the
man
who
is
paid
a
lump
sum
to
assume
them
renunciations
living
in
a
flat
or
even
in
a
city
house
we
do
not
know
nor
care
to
know
who
the
people
above
or
next
door
to
us
may
be
and
they
are
in
precisely
the
same
position
with
regard
to
us
mere
adjacency
gives
us
no
claim
upon
their
acquaintance
nor
does
it
put
us
at
the
mercy
of
their
insistence
our
calling
list
is
not
governed
by
locality
and
we
can
cut
it
as
we
wish
without
embarrassment
choice
is
not
so
easy
in
the
suburb
there
willynilly
we
must
know
our
neighbors
and
be
known
by
them
fortunately
in
most
instances
they
will
be
found
to
be
of
the
right
sort
if
not
fully
congenial
the
theater
too
must
become
rather
a
diversion
than
a
regular
feature
of
our
existence
if
it
has
been
so
whatever
enthusiasm
we
may
possess
for
the
opera
an
occasional
visit
with
its
midnight
return
will
soon
come
to
satisfy
us
our
pet
lectures
club
life
participation
in
public
affairs
frequent
mail
delivery
convenience
of
shopping
car
service
and
freedom
from
time
tables
these
suggest
what
we
have
to
put
behind
us
when
we
pass
the
city
gates
it
is
also
the
part
of
wisdom
not
to
forget
that
though
the
country
is
alive
with
delights
for
us
when
all
nature
is
garbed
in
green
and
the
songbirds
carol
in
the
elms
and
maples
there
cometh
a
time
if
we
are
of
the
north
when
fur
caps
are
in
season
the
coal
scoop
is
in
every
man
hand
the
snow
shovel
splintereth
and
the
lawn
mower
is
at
rest
then
it
is
that
our
allegiance
to
country
life
will
be
strained
if
ever
particularly
if
we
have
provided
ourselves
with
a
walk
to
the
station
wading
through
snow
against
a
winter
wind
we
see
the
agreeable
constitutional
of
the
milder
days
in
a
different
light
we
should
think
of
all
these
things
and
of
some
sacrifices
purely
personal
it
is
better
to
think
now
than
after
the
moving
man
bill
has
come
in
reason
as
we
may
regrets
will
come
perhaps
loneliness
but
the
compensations
if
we
have
chosen
wisely
will
be
increasingly
apparent
and
we
shall
be
the
very
exceptions
of
exceptions
if
before
the
second
summer
has
passed
we
are
not
wedded
beyond
divorce
to
the
new
home
once
determined
upon
forswearing
urban
residence
a
multitude
of
considerations
arise
first
of
these
is
which
place
our
suburban
towns
have
been
developed
in
two
ways
some
are
made
to
order
while
others
were
originally
rural
villages
but
have
come
under
metropolitan
influence
living
in
the
latter
is
likely
to
be
less
expensive
and
local
life
may
have
more
of
a
distinctive
character
but
the
husk
of
the
past
is
almost
certain
to
be
evident
in
the
mixture
of
old
and
modern
houses
and
in
a
certain
offish
separation
of
the
native
and
incoming
elements
the
town
is
likely
to
exhibit
better
streets
and
sidewalks
to
be
more
capably
cared
for
to
be
freer
from
shanties
and
to
possess
no
saloons
land
and
living
may
demand
greater
expenditure
but
they
will
be
worth
the
difference
schools
and
churches
with
out
of
a
hundred
families
the
deciding
argument
in
favor
of
going
to
the
suburb
has
just
got
into
short
dresses
and
begun
to
say
already
we
see
pointings
to
the
childish
activities
that
we
would
not
check
no
one
who
stops
to
think
about
it
chooses
to
have
his
children
play
in
the
city
streets
or
be
confined
to
a
flat
during
the
open
months
for
the
children
sake
if
not
for
our
own
we
turn
to
the
country
and
one
of
our
first
thoughts
is
for
the
children
school
i
called
on
a
young
business
acquaintance
recently
and
found
him
engrossed
in
examining
a
pile
of
college
catalogues
going
in
for
a
i
inquired
why
have
you
heard
he
responded
a
boy
week
ago
saturday
er
would
you
say
yale
or
harvard
this
was
preparedness
with
a
vengeance
to
be
sure
but
almost
before
we
realize
that
infancy
is
past
the
boy
and
girl
will
be
ready
for
school
and
it
is
important
to
know
that
the
right
school
will
be
ready
for
them
happily
the
suburban
school
is
usually
of
special
excellence
and
the
chief
thought
must
be
of
distance
and
whether
the
children
will
need
to
cross
dangerous
railroad
tracks
we
shall
of
course
wish
to
be
where
there
are
strong
churches
with
a
society
of
our
chosen
denomination
if
possible
it
may
be
that
the
social
life
which
has
its
center
there
will
provide
all
the
relaxation
we
require
if
we
seek
outside
circles
it
is
desirable
to
know
whether
we
are
likely
to
please
and
be
pleased
always
there
is
the
suburban
club
but
not
always
is
the
suburban
club
representative
of
the
really
best
people
of
the
town
transportation
on
the
practical
side
a
question
of
large
importance
is
that
of
transportation
the
fast
trains
may
make
the
run
in
twenty
minutes
but
we
shall
not
always
catch
the
fast
trains
and
the
others
may
take
forty
morning
and
evening
they
should
be
so
frequent
that
we
need
not
lose
a
whole
hour
on
a
miss
in
stormy
weather
we
must
find
shelter
in
the
station
comfortable
or
uncomfortable
on
the
husband
monthly
ticket
the
rides
may
cost
only
a
dime
when
the
wife
and
her
visiting
friends
go
to
the
matinée
each
punch
counts
for
a
quarter
and
four
quarters
make
a
dollar
to
the
time
of
the
train
must
be
added
the
walk
or
ride
from
the
downtown
station
to
the
office
and
the
return
walk
from
the
home
station
a
electric
line
for
emergencies
may
sometimes
save
an
appointment
none
of
these
things
alone
will
probably
give
pause
to
our
plans
but
all
will
weigh
in
our
general
satisfaction
or
disagreement
with
suburban
life
the
butcher
the
baker
and
the
maker
not
every
suburb
is
blessed
with
a
perfectly
healthful
water
supply
we
must
make
sure
of
that
we
want
to
find
stores
and
markets
sufficient
to
our
smaller
needs
at
least
and
to
be
within
city
delivery
bounds
so
that
the
man
of
the
house
shall
not
be
required
to
make
of
himself
a
beast
of
burden
we
hope
if
we
must
employ
a
cook
that
the
milkman
iceman
and
grocery
boy
will
prove
acceptable
to
her
for
the
policeman
is
sure
to
be
a
dignified
native
of
family
we
want
the
telephone
without
a
prohibitive
toll
electric
light
and
gas
of
good
quality
at
reasonable
rates
streets
paved
and
well
cared
for
sidewalks
of
cement
reasonable
fire
and
police
protection
a
progressive
community
spirit
and
a
reputation
for
our
town
that
will
make
us
proud
to
name
it
as
our
place
of
abode
the
home
acre
all
these
things
may
be
had
in
scores
of
american
suburbs
and
smaller
cities
but
when
we
have
selected
the
one
or
more
towns
that
may
please
us
and
get
down
to
the
house
or
lot
our
range
of
choice
will
be
found
rather
narrow
in
the
neighborhoods
we
would
select
it
is
probable
that
few
houses
are
to
be
rented
most
of
them
have
been
built
for
occupancy
by
their
owners
who
if
forced
to
go
elsewhere
have
preferred
selling
to
renting
there
is
no
prejudice
against
renters
but
the
sentiment
is
against
renting
and
this
sentiment
is
well
grounded
in
common
sense
still
some
families
find
it
advisable
to
rent
for
a
year
or
so
meanwhile
studying
the
local
conditions
and
selecting
a
building
site
this
plan
has
much
to
commend
it
though
it
makes
a
second
move
necessary
others
who
do
not
feel
assured
that
a
change
in
business
will
not
compel
an
early
removal
wisely
prefer
to
rent
if
a
suitable
house
can
be
found
for
what
they
can
afford
to
pay
comparative
cost
in
renting
the
proportion
of
income
that
may
be
set
aside
for
rent
depends
on
what
that
payment
covers
in
a
city
flat
with
complete
janitor
service
for
instance
the
rent
at
is
really
no
higher
than
the
suburban
house
for
heat
and
water
rent
are
included
with
the
former
perhaps
as
much
as
a
third
of
one
income
could
be
spared
for
the
fixed
charge
of
rent
but
in
the
country
the
proportion
can
not
with
safety
be
greater
than
a
fifth
few
satisfactory
suburban
houses
can
be
rented
under
and
to
this
must
be
added
the
cost
not
only
of
coal
and
water
but
of
maintenance
on
the
whole
we
are
pretty
sure
to
decide
that
it
is
better
and
cheaper
to
buy
than
to
rent
the
location
sense
there
is
some
advantage
in
being
able
to
secure
a
lot
in
a
square
already
built
up
if
present
conditions
are
satisfactory
we
may
feel
reasonably
sure
that
they
will
remain
so
we
know
who
our
neighbors
are
to
be
the
sort
of
houses
and
other
improvements
that
will
affect
the
sightliness
and
value
of
our
own
property
and
the
surroundings
that
should
in
some
degree
govern
the
style
of
our
abode
there
is
little
of
the
speculative
in
such
a
choice
but
we
shall
have
to
pay
something
extra
for
our
assurances
in
a
well
town
however
we
are
likely
to
find
a
more
eligible
natural
site
at
less
cost
if
we
are
not
too
insistent
upon
being
close
to
the
railway
station
the
best
sites
in
the
older
sections
are
already
occupied
or
are
held
at
a
premium
if
we
have
an
eye
for
location
and
the
courage
of
our
convictions
we
may
chance
upon
an
excellent
lot
that
can
be
had
for
a
comparatively
small
price
because
of
its
detachment
it
may
be
so
situated
that
the
approach
is
through
the
choicest
part
of
the
village
affording
us
much
of
the
charm
of
suburban
life
without
additional
cost
provided
sewer
water
light
sidewalks
and
paving
are
in
a
little
greater
distance
from
the
center
may
be
well
repaid
by
the
beauty
of
the
site
and
after
the
family
becomes
accustomed
to
it
the
distance
is
scarcely
noticed
where
there
are
telephones
and
local
delivery
of
mail
and
groceries
occasions
for
going
uptown
are
not
frequent
size
of
lot
the
lot
should
have
at
least
foot
frontage
and
be
from
to
feet
in
depth
many
subdivisions
are
now
platted
without
alleys
which
are
not
desirable
unless
scrupulously
maintained
the
site
should
if
practicable
be
on
a
plateau
or
elevation
that
gives
an
outlook
or
at
least
make
natural
drainage
certain
a
lot
below
street
level
means
expensive
filling
to
be
done
position
there
can
be
little
question
as
to
the
special
desirability
of
an
east
frontage
with
this
exposure
the
morning
sunlight
falls
upon
the
living
room
when
least
in
use
while
the
afternoon
glare
finds
the
principal
work
of
the
kitchen
accomplished
the
indispensable
veranda
on
the
east
and
south
is
also
usable
for
a
maximum
portion
of
the
day
while
the
more
solid
side
of
the
structure
being
opposed
to
the
prevailing
winter
winds
makes
the
heating
problem
easier

a
unique
arrangement
of
the
porch
outlook
and
inlook
though
we
should
not
pay
too
much
premium
for
an
east
front
it
is
always
most
salable
and
the
difference
will
come
back
if
we
should
dispose
of
the
property
later
outlook
and
protection
against
being
shut
in
should
be
assured
our
own
property
may
be
gilt
edge
but
if
the
man
across
the
way
has
backed
up
a
barn
or
chicken
yard
in
front
of
us
our
joy
in
life
will
be
considerably
lessened
our
home
is
both
to
look
at
and
to
look
out
from
and
we
do
more
of
the
latter
than
of
the
former
there
are
only
two
ways
to
make
sure
of
not
being
shut
in
unless
the
adjacent
lots
are
already
improved
these
are
to
buy
enough
ground
to
give
space
on
either
side
or
to
secure
a
corner
sometimes
a
corner
at
a
higher
price
is
the
cheaper
in
the
end
certainly
it
is
advisable
even
though
our
own
house
be
not
to
discover
if
there
is
a
building
restriction
to
prevent
the
erection
of
cheap
structures
near
by
this
is
regulated
usually
by
a
stipulation
in
the
deeds
from
the
original
subdivider
without
this
guaranty
even
a
high
price
for
lots
does
not
insure
that
some
fellow
who
has
put
most
of
his
money
into
the
ground
may
not
put
up
a
woodshed
next
door
and
live
in
it
until
he
can
build
a
house
we
shall
not
find
it
amiss
either
to
know
something
of
the
character
of
the
owners
of
the
adjoining
property
for
if
they
are
men
there
is
a
probability
of
their
putting
up
houses
built
to
sell
owner
may
be
expected
to
allow
their
vacant
lots
to
remain
unkempt
and
to
object
to
all
improvement
assessments
trees
trees
on
the
lot
are
a
valuable
asset
though
dislike
for
sacrificing
them
if
carried
too
far
may
result
in
shutting
out
the
sunlight
that
is
more
essential
than
shade
to
health
cottonwood
willows
and
even
the
pretty
catalpa
are
to
be
shunned
in
the
interest
of
tidiness
on
a
or
even
lot
we
can
not
have
many
trees
without
overshadowing
the
house
a
few
away
from
the
building
not
crowded
together
will
give
more
satisfaction
than
a
grove
and
be
less
a
detriment
to
health
ordinarily
grass
will
not
grow
to
advantage
where
there
is
much
shade
and
a
beautiful
lawn
though
open
to
the
sunlight
is
not
only
more
attractive
but
much
more
serviceable
than
ground
in
heavy
shadow
and
covered
with
sparse
grass
income
and
expenditure
prices
of
vacant
property
in
different
sections
vary
so
greatly
that
one
can
not
safely
approximate
the
cost
of
a
building
lot
it
is
safe
to
say
though
that
if
values
are
figured
on
a
proper
basis
a
satisfactory
site
for
a
home
can
be
purchased
for
in
the
town
of
our
choice
we
have
made
it
clear
to
ourselves
that
a
home
anyone
home
should
be
much
more
than
a
house
plumped
down
upon
any
bit
of
ground
that
will
hold
it
when
we
come
to
consider
the
house
itself
we
are
confronted
by
the
knowledge
that
here
the
tastes
and
habits
as
well
as
the
size
and
resources
of
the
family
must
govern
the
decision
of
many
problems
considered
numbers
alone
are
not
always
a
fair
guide
for
sometimes
the
man
or
the
woman
of
the
house
or
the
baby
counts
for
much
more
than
one
in
figuring
space
requirements
we
have
in
mind
here
that
we
are
a
family
of
four
that
we
have
an
income
of
from
to
and
that
we
are
prepared
to
spend
or
obligate
ourselves
to
spend
from
to
for
a
house
to
go
on
a
lot
to
cost
the
house
we
think
of
would
be
not
too
large
for
two
and
certainly
would
comfortably
accommodate
five
or
even
six
depending
upon
their
relations
to
one
another
the
extremes
of
income
mentioned
would
scarcely
affect
our
plans
and
the
difference
in
cost
is
accounted
for
by
the
choice
of
nonessentials
and
not
by
differences
in
the
principal
features
of
the
house
style
now
if
we
have
already
set
our
hearts
upon
having
a
house
just
like
that
love
of
a
place
we
saw
in
the
other
day
we
shall
have
to
reconsider
the
entire
lot
proposition
we
may
as
well
face
the
fact
that
the
house
which
is
everything
appropriate
and
artistic
in
one
place
may
in
another
be
simply
grotesque
in
this
phase
of
the
selective
work
we
will
profit
by
the
advice
of
the
architect
if
he
be
something
of
an
artist
and
not
simply
a
draughtsman
at
any
rate
if
we
have
the
lot
let
us
decide
what
style
of
house
should
be
on
it
if
we
are
surely
settled
upon
the
house
then
by
all
means
let
us
get
a
lot
it
will
fit
and
have
a
care
too
with
regard
to
the
style
of
architecture
or
lack
of
it
in
our
prospective
neighbors
houses
there
have
been
two
extremes
in
later
american
home
architecture
overornamentation
and
absolute
disregard
for
appearance
the
first
arose
from
a
feeling
that
every
dollar
spent
in
the
interest
of
art
should
be
so
gewgawed
to
the
outer
world
that
all
who
passed
might
note
the
costliness
and
wonder
the
second
extreme
had
its
birth
in
an
elementary
practicality
that
believes
anything
artistic
must
be
both
extravagant
and
useless
none
of
us
can
afford
to
build
a
house
merely
for
its
artistic
qualities
yet
we
feel
that
we
owe
it
to
our
neighbors
and
to
the
community
to
make
the
house
sightly
most
of
all
we
owe
it
to
ourselves
for
the
product
of
our
plans
will
be
the
concrete
expression
of
our
personality
fortunately
showiness
is
neither
necessary
nor
desirable
while
artistic
qualities
are
not
so
much
a
matter
of
money
as
of
thought
a
few
days
ago
in
a
suburb
of
a
western
city
i
passed
two
houses
recently
constructed
one
was
simply
an
enlarged
drygoods
box
with
a
few
windows
and
doors
broken
into
its
sides
altogether
a
hideous
disfigurement
to
the
charming
spot
on
which
it
was
erected
across
the
way
stood
the
other
cottage
with
the
same
number
of
rooms
as
its
but
really
exquisite
in
its
simple
beauty
and
the
latter
i
was
told
though
equally
spacious
cost
less
than
the
monstrosity
across
the
way
into
the
one
there
was
put
thought
into
the
other
none
can
we
resist
an
opinion
as
to
which
home
will
be
happier
size
should
we
be
somewhat
limited
in
funds
we
may
have
to
make
a
selection
between
a
large
house
finished
in
cheaper
materials
and
a
small
house
of
the
best
quality
all
through
doubtless
much
of
the
hominess
that
attaches
us
to
some
houses
is
due
to
their
snugness
but
not
all
of
it
size
is
secondary
to
adaptation
to
the
family
requirements
waste
space
is
an
abomination
because
it
adds
unnecessarily
to
the
burden
of
the
housekeeper
yet
to
be
so
cramped
that
everything
must
be
moved
every
day
is
not
a
satisfactory
alternative
there
should
be
some
reserve
not
only
for
emergencies
but
for
future
needs
that
may
be
foreseen
as
the
children
grow
up
they
will
demand
more
room
and
we
shall
want
to
give
it
to
them
if
we
do
not
care
to
maintain
surplus
space
for
possible
needs
the
house
should
at
least
be
planned
with
a
view
to
making
additions
that
will
be
in
keeping
with
the
general
effect
and
will
readily
fall
in
with
the
practical
arrangement
of
the
house
what
is
said
about
emergency
space
applies
principally
to
the
sleeping
apartments
there
is
an
altogether
happy
tendency
in
these
days
to
simplify
the
living
rooms
and
to
plan
them
for
constant
use
we
of
the
east
have
something
to
learn
from
the
californians
whose
bungalows
and
cottages
are
so
often
models
of
simplicity
without
the
crudeness
of
most
small
houses
in
other
sections
our
coast
brethren
have
demonstrated
that
a
or
cottage
will
satisfactorily
house
a
considerable
family
and
that
it
may
be
given
the
characteristics
that
charm
without
increasing
the
cost
plans
for
building
the
simplest
and
in
many
instances
the
prettiest
cottages
are
of
only
a
single
story
but
more
than
four
rooms
in
one
story
makes
a
comparatively
expensive
house
besides
using
up
a
great
deal
of
ground
with
the
foundation
first
story
and
roof
provided
for
the
second
story
adds
little
to
the
cost
compared
to
the
space
gained
where
ground
and
labor
are
cheap
the
single
story
is
to
be
considered
but
in
most
places
it
would
not
be
practicable
for
us
in
planning
the
house
due
regard
must
be
had
for
the
dispositions
of
the
respective
members
of
the
family
in
any
event
we
shall
not
please
all
of
them
but
the
less
the
others
have
to
complain
about
the
happier
the
rest
of
us
shall
be
necessary
rooms
if
paterfamilias
is
accustomed
to
depositing
his
apparel
and
other
belongings
rather
promiscuously
about
expecting
to
find
things
where
they
were
left
on
his
return
in
the
evening
it
may
be
better
to
plan
his
room
where
it
may
stand
undisturbed
rather
than
to
attempt
the
breaking
of
a
habit
which
shows
that
he
feels
at
home
in
his
own
house
likewise
some
place
there
should
be
where
the
mistress
may
conduct
her
sewing
operations
without
wildly
scrambling
to
clean
up
when
the
doorbell
rings
the
children
should
have
at
least
one
place
in
the
house
where
they
may
let
loose
on
a
rainy
day
and
the
master
should
have
somewhere
a
retreat
safe
from
interruption
as
well
as
a
workroom
in
the
basement
in
which
the
tools
and
implements
that
quickly
accumulate
in
a
country
home
may
be
secure
the
sick
room
sickness
too
may
come
and
the
questions
of
privacy
without
an
unwholesome
curb
upon
both
children
and
adults
of
convenience
to
hot
water
and
the
bathroom
of
saving
steps
for
the
nurse
should
be
thought
of
an
upstairs
chamber
is
likely
to
be
best
on
account
of
the
ventilation
lighting
and
distance
from
ordinary
noises
but
frequent
journeys
to
the
kitchen
mean
an
excess
of
stair
climbing
whether
there
be
sickness
or
not
there
should
be
somewhere
provision
for
individual
privacy
where
absolute
rest
may
be
gained
a
large
indulgence
in
entertaining
must
have
its
influence
in
settling
both
size
and
arrangement
ordinarily
however
we
may
expect
to
be
reasonably
hospitable
without
enlarging
our
home
into
a
clubhouse
if
we
do
not
consider
this
matter
in
building
propriety
must
compel
us
afterwards
to
limit
our
company
to
numbers
that
we
can
comfortably
care
for
room
to
entertain
a
good
many
of
us
who
have
contrived
very
nicely
to
live
in
a
city
flat
seem
to
think
that
we
can

though
the

would
be
considerably
more
spacious

taking
the

into
account
so
far
however
as
absolute
essentials
go
a
house
carefully
planned
will
provide
for
a

very
comfortably

it

about
ten

more
in

probably
for
a
less
sum
in
smaller
cities
an
house
would
cost
about
a
third
more
and
is
of
course
in
many
ways
more
desirable
but
generally
speaking
we
demand
more
room
than
we
really
need
and
then
put
ourselves
to
additional
expense

up
the

the

there
can

it

the

should
be
well
understood

that
it
should
be
planned

most
of

would
not
think
of
calling
for
an
parlor
in
a
small
house
nowadays
but
merely
to
change
the
name
from
parlor
to

does
change
our

the

to
take
the

if
the

adjust
themselves
to
it
a
great
saving
of

is
effected
and
the

is
given
added
enjoyment
not
all
of
us
however
can
fit
ourselves
to

it

ourselves
than
to
be
uncomfortable

a
homelike
living

the
plan
in
a
small

reduces
the

hall
to
something
little
more
than
a
vestibule
but
where
six
rooms
are
exceeded
the
reception
hall
may
be
enlarged
and
made
serviceable
the
first
impression
counts
for
much
not
only
with
our
guests
but
with
ourselves
and
if
the
hall
be
appropriately
finished
and
fitted
it
seems
fairly
to
envelop
one
with
its
welcome
one
thing
that
must
be
insured
whatever
form
the

may
take
is
that
it

many

do
no

the

saves

we
may
well
learn
for

that

still
it
is
better
to
defy
modern

even
to
pain
the
architect
than
that
the
faithful
who
clings
tenaciously
to
the
old
idea
should
be
made
miserable
some
persons

perpetually
cramped
in

however
we
may
permit

to
be

it

an

that
sensible

flat
living
has
taught
us
to
make
use
of
all
our

and
perhaps
its
influence
is
against
hospitality
but
we
need
not
neglect
that
very
important
feature
of
a
happy
home
in
doing
ourselves
simple
justice
thinking
it
out

we
should
live

will
picture
us
in
possession
advice
is
not
to
be
disdained
and
a
good

we
shall
find
to
be
a
blessing
but
the
happiness
of
our

will
be
in
double
measure
if
we

feel
that
something
of

gone
into

a

comfort

which
would
be
of

they
are
so
leaving
the
everlastingly
pestiferous
question
of

aside
what
is
the
best
flooring
well
so
far
no
one
has
been
able
to
suggest
anything
that
seems
so
appropriate
as
a
good
quality

hard

which
means
oak

maple

both
properly
treated
and
above
all
laid
down
as
it
should
be
the

is
a
permanent
part
of
the
house
or
if
it
is
we
certainly
wish
it
had
been
as
it
is
subject
to
harder
and
more
constant
usage
than
any
other
part
of
the
structure
it
must
be
strong
and
it
must
have
a
surface
that
will
resist

or
we
shall
simply
store
up
trouble
for
the
future
it
is
also
a
part
of
the

and
as
such
must
help
to
furnish
the
keynote
of
our
plans
all
these
requirements
are
met
by
hard
wood
it
is
possible
we
may
admit
to
have
a
happy
and
comfortable
home
with
cheaper
flooring
but
the
price
that
is
not
paid
in
money
will
be
afterwards
collected
with
interest
in
effort
and
sacrifice
of
satisfaction
doubtless
it
is
not
wise
as
some
one
suggests
to
put
so
much
money
into
our
floors
that
we
can
not
afford
to
buy
anything
to
put
on
them
but
in
many
instances
the
appearance
of
our
house
interiors
would
be
much
more
pleasing
if
fewer
pieces
of
superfluous
furniture
were
brought
in

with
another
kind
of
beauty
or
ugliness
in
the
form

carpets
but
experience
has
long
since
made
it
clear
to
all
of
us
that
rugs
are
not
only
more
healthful
and
in
better
taste
but
taken
by
and
large
give
less
trouble
to
the
housekeeper
than
carpets
owing
to
the
fixed
position
of
the
latter
they
are

less
durable
it
is
true
that
in
some
parts
of
the
house
a
rug
or
carpet
fastened
down
may
be
desirable
but
with
good
floors
no
such
thing
will
suggest
itself
in
the
living

a
very
small

should
do

serviceable
mats
are
seldom
things
of

as
they
come
under
the
head
of

it
may
be
well
to
note
that
the
best
quality
leather
mat
guaranteed
to
last
twenty
years
costs
a
square
foot
a
fair
imitation
may
be
had
for
less
than
half
that
figure
and
has
the
same
proportion
of
value
the
mat
that
serves
best
with
tenacious
mud
costs
cents
per
square
foot
and
for
rubber
we
must
add
a
half
or
double
the
price
depending
on
whether
we
demand
the
article
or
are
content
with
stock
the
old
reliable
cocoa
mat
may
be
had
from
cents
per
square
foot
up
and
is
quite
as
useful
and
scarcely
uglier
than
the
others
the

for
appearance
sake
if
our
stairway
is
well
constructed
of
good
woods
we
should
forbear
to
hide
it
but
there
is
no
place
in
the
house
where
little
willie
can
more
effectively
proclaim
to
all
the
household
world
his
possession
of
heels
than
on
the
unprotected
rises
of
the
stairway
even
the
tiny
heels
of
the
mistress
of
the
home
seem
to
clump
like
the
boots
of
a
giant
in
their
numberless
journeys
up
and
down
so
the
hall
runner
must
have
a
place
perhaps
the
carpet
will
be
of
red
or
green
depending
on
the
walls
but
it
need
cost
little
more
than
per
yard
for
a
fair

it
is
put

use
in
the
hall
we
will
do
wisely
to
get
either
a
article
that
may
be
renewed
or
something
expensive
that
will
wear
indefinitely
sometimes
the
latter
is
the
more
economical
plan
very
often
halls
are
so
shaped
that
a
rug
must
be
made
to
order
it
is
better
to
do
this
and
have
a
rug
that
will
lie
well
than
to
risk
tripping
and
slipping
with
smaller
ones
for
the
living
room
a
variety
of
choice
in
rugs
is
offered
attempts
to
utilize
a
number
of
small
rugs
are
not
usually
joyous
in
their
outcome
besides
the
floor
space
is
too
badly
broken
up
the
large
center
rug
holds
its
own
with
some
reenforcement
in
the
alcove
or
perhaps
before
the
hearth
what
quality
the
rug
shall
be
depends
largely
upon
the
length
of
our
purse
yet
sagacity
and
a
modest
fund
will
sometimes
do
more
than
plethora
and
no
thought
design
selection
is
a
task
to
vex
the
most
patient
but
we
must
not
be
drawn
into
a
hurried
decision
if
we
are
near
enough
to
the
business
house
with
which
we
are
dealing
it
is
advisable
to
have
a
selection
of
rugs
sent
out
for
inspection
on
the
floors
seen
in
the
salesroom
and
in
our
house
they
may
present
different
aspects
generally
speaking
the
showiest
designs
are
in
the
cheaper
goods
and
the
showier
a
cheap
article
is
the
quicker
its
shoddy
qualities
will
be
made
manifest
therefore
if
we
must
count
the
pennies
on
our
rug
let
us
select
a
simple
design
with
a
good
body
something
that
will
be
unobtrusive
even
when
it
begins
to
appeal
for
replacement
there
is
a
considerable
range
of
wiltons
from
the
wilton
velvet
to
the
royal
wilton
they
are
by
no
means
the
cheapest
though
one
may
go
fabulously
beyond
them
in
price
but
their
popularity
shows
them
to
be
a
good
average
quality
suited
to
the
home
planned
on
a
modest
scale
body
brussels
although
not
affording
such
rich
effects
also
has
many
friends
and
tapestry
brussels
may
be
considered
there
are
names
innumerable
for
rugs
and
carpets
some
of
which
have
little
real
significance
if
one
knows
a
good
design
when
it
is
seen
a
little
observation
of
weights
and
weave
and
a
thoughtful
comparison
of
prices
will
help
to
secure
the
best
selections

most
grades
of

for
the

room
the
problem
is
about
the
same
as
for
the
principal
apartment
the
rug
need
not
be
so
expensive
as
the
one
in
the
living
room
but
it
must
assuredly
be
of
the
enduring
sort
the
scotch
caledon
rugs
sometimes
solve
the
difficulty
here
indeed
they
are
not
out
of
place
in
a
really
homey
living
room
or
elsewhere
in
the
house
they
are
made
of
wool
woven
like
an
ingrain
with
no
nap
and
are
especially
pleasing
for
their
artistic
soft
colorings
mostly
in
green
or
blue
effects
they
are
strictly
speaking
not
reversible
but
some
designs
will
permit
use
on
both
sides
while
they
do
not
wear
quite
so
well
as
a
wilton
they
come
at

a
fifth
cheaper
prices
range
from
for

to
for

by
the
sizes
we
have
mentioned
are
standard
if
our
rooms
have
been
planned
in
such
wise
as
to
require
rugs
to
order
we
shall
have
to
add
ten
per
cent
to
our
expenditures
oriental
rugs
the
subject
of
oriental
rugs
to
be
intelligently
discussed
would
require
an
entire
book
and
there
are
books
that
may
be
and
should
be
studied
by
those
who
can
afford
orientals
most
of
us
can
not
there
are
indeed
good
reasons
for
the
high
cost
of
the
genuine
oriental
in
its
superior
coloring
wide
range
of
design
and
wonderful
durability
the
right
sort
grows
richer
with
age
but
our
plans
are
not
so
much
for
posterity
as
for
present
uses
and
we
can
get
along
very
well
without
testing
our
wits
in
the
oriental
rug
market
it
is
a
test
of
wits
for
there
are
no
standards
of
size
or
price
and
spurious
goods
sometimes
get
into
the
best
of
hands
small
daghestans
and
baloochistans
may
be
had
even
lower
than
but
anything
we
would
care
to
have
in

would
take

from
our
bank

oriental

of
good
design
shirvan

and
upper
floors

perhaps
in

rear
vestibule
unless
the
floor
is
of
a
sort
to
be
easily
wiped
up
linoleum
may
be
demanded
the
upper

will
require
a
continuation
of
the
stair

with
perhaps
a
rug
if
it
broadens
out
at
the
landing
for
the
bed
chambers
the
question
of
individual
use
must
be
thought
of
brussels
rugs
will
do
in
most
cases
a
large
rug
means
considerable
shifting
to
get
at
the
floor
but
is
the
more
comfortable
smaller
rugs
will
permit
sweeping
under
the
bed
without
moving
it
far
and
should
be
placed
under
the
casters
which
will
injure
the
floors
if
allowed
to
rest
directly
thereupon
matting
and
cordoman
cloth
next
in
choice
would
be
to
spend
or
cents
a
yard
for
matting
and
cover
the
entire
floor
adding
one
or
two
rugs
to
head
off
the
shivery
feeling
that
arises
from
a
contact
of
bare
feet
with
cold
matting
on
a
winter
morning
the
casters
will
cut
the
matting
too
we
must
look
out
for
that
a
border
of
flooring
painted
or
not
may
be
left
but
generally
if
anything
is
to
be
fastened
down
it
should
cover
the
entire
space
avoiding
the
ugly
accumulation
of
dust
that
otherwise
gathers
under
the
edges
more
expensive
than
matting
but
likely
to
be
quite
satisfactory
is
cordoman
cloth
a
floor
covering
that
comes
in
plain
colors
and
may
be
easily
swept
and
wiped
up
it
costs
from
to
cents
per
yard
and
the
wadded
cotton
lining
that
goes
with
it
is
very
cheap
considering
its
greater
durability
than
matting
cordoman
is
really
the
more
economical
and
the
homemaker
will
do
well
to
investigate
its
merits
children

and

the

linoleum
will
probably
stand
the
wear

prove
more
hygienic
and
do
as
much
toward
deadening
noise
as
anything
short
of
an
impossible
padding
could
do
on
the
porch
a
rug
or
two
the
sort
that
stand
rain
and
resist
moths
may
be
desired
but
they
can
wait
until
we
are
settled
and
have
found
our
bearings
the
den
if
there
is
to
be
one
or
the
separate
library
may
in
the
one
instance
be
left
to
individual
caprice
in
the
other
to
good
judgment
in
suiting
it
to
the
prevailing
thought
uses
of
the
decorator
if
we
have
not
done
so
before
when
we
take
up
consideration
of
the
walls
we
will
if
we
can
afford
it
call
in
a
professional
decorator
first
of
course
we
will
make
sure
that
he
really
may
be
of
service
to
us
for
his
duty
is
to
give
practical
and
artistic
development
to
the
more
or
less
vague
ideas
of
which
we
have
become
possessed
and
if
he
seems
from
examples
of
previous
work
to
be
wedded
to
a
style
of
his
own
that
would
not
jibe
with
our
aspirations
we
would
better
try
to
struggle
along
without
him
but
it
is
possible
to
secure
the
services
of
a
decorative
artist
for
a
sum
not
necessarily
tremendous
and
if
we
get
hold
of
a
sensible
fellow
his
advice
will
be
in
the
end
worth
much
more
than
the
extra
outlay
if
he
is
a
sincere
artist
he
will
plan
just
as
carefully
for
a
modest
cottage
as
for
a
mansion
and
he
will
be
able
to
take
the
good
points
of
our
own
schemes
and
adapt
them
to
expert
application
without
making
us
feel
too
insignificant
explicit
advice
as
to
decoration
where
there
are
thousands
of
us
each
in
different
circumstances
and
with
variant
tastes
would
be
rather
an
absurdity
we
may
emphasize
to
ourselves
however
a
few
phases
of
the
decorative
problem
in
which
lack
of
thought
would
lose
to
us
some
of
the
joys
of
a
house
perfected
if
we
are
not
to
employ
a
decorator
we
must
study
out
the
problem
for
ourselves
to
leave
it
for
the
painter
and
paperhanger
to
settle
would
be
a
fatal
error
much
knowledge
may
be
gained
by
the
study
of
books
and
magazine
articles
provided
they
are
very
recent
it
will
be
advisable
to
weigh
this
knowledge
in
the
scales
of
practical
observation
however
in
houses
of
late
date
this
is
not
so
much
because
of
changes
in
fashion
as
for
the
reason
that
improvements
in
process
are
always
being
made
and
even
the
omnipresent
folk
who
write
books
sometimes
overlook
a
point
concerning
fashion
which
of
course
has
its
sway
in
decoration
we
will
remember
that
the
simplest
treatment
survives
longest
wood
in
decoration
it
seems
that
with
the
steady
increase
in
cost
of
lumber
we
have
grown
more
and
more
to
appreciate
the
beauty
of
our
woods
at
any
rate
wood
is
being
used
more
extensively
than
ever
in
interior
finishing
this
is
in
some
ways
a
healthy
tendency
as
it
makes
for
simplicity
and
admits
of
artistic
treatment
at
a
reasonable
cost
hall
living
room
and
dining
room
for
instance
may
be
treated
with
a
high
or
low
wood
wainscoting
and
wooden
panels
extending
to
a
wooden
cornice
at
the
ceiling
the
wood
may
be
a
weathered
oak
and
between
the
panels
is
a
rough
plaster
in
gray
or
tinted
to
suit
the
house
scheme
friezes
and
plastic
cornices
are
somewhat
on
the
wane
in
smaller
houses
at
least
though
of
course
they
will
never
go
out
of
use
altogether
panels
and
plaster
this
plaster
effect
is
less
expensive
than
burlap
or
ordinary
white
calcimine
or
paper
the
picture
molding
may
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
cornice
sometimes
the
cornice
is
dropped
to
a
level
with
the
tops
of
the
doors
and
windows
usually
about
seven
feet
leaving
a
frieze
of
two
or
three
feet
the
molding
then
going
to
the
top
of
the
cornice
ceilings
and
friezes
of
ivory
or
light
yellow
are
usually
in
good
taste
the
living
room
may
carry
out
the
panel
and
plaster
effect
but
is
more
likely
to
demand
a
simple
paper
of
good
quality
with
no
border
here
as
in
the
hall
the
wooden
or
plastic
cornice
with
no
frieze
is
suggested
grilles
are
discarded
and
portières
are
avoided
where
possible
the
beamed
ceiling
in
the
dining
room
the
beamed
ceiling
has
been
found
so
appropriate
that
it
continues
popular
it
is
simple
easily
maintained
and
has
the
broad
deep
lines
that
put
one
at
ease
here
it
is
advisable
to
carry
a
wooden
wainscoting
up
to
about
feet
the
panels
continuing
to
the
ceiling
tapestry
burlap
or
plaster
may
show
above
plate
shelves
are
somewhat
in
disfavor
partly
because
of
abuse
and
partly
because
the
tendency
is
to
eliminate
all
that
are
not
necessities
where
doors
and
windows
are
built
on
a
line
as
they
should
be
shelves
are
sometimes
placed
over
them
but
there
should
not
be
too
many
broken
lines
if
we
would
preserve
the
comfortable
suggestion
of
the
beamed
ceiling
paint
paper
and
calcimine
for
the
kitchen
painted
walls
which
can
be
easily
wiped
off
and
resist
steam
are
preferable
to
calcimine
tiling
halfway
up
will
be
found
still
better
but
tiling
paper
which
costs
more
than
painting
is
scarcely
to
be
chosen
for
the
bedrooms
the
professional
decorators
are
disposed
to
over
elaboration
a
simple
paper
costing
to
cents
per
roll
is
best
or
even
plain
calcimine
which
many
persons
consider
more
healthful
the
latter
costs
only
or
a
room
and
may
be
renewed
every
year
or
two
very
nice
effects
are
had
in
a
panel
trimming
running
to
a
wood
cornice
and
in
natural
wood
or
painted
white
with
this
the
ceiling
should
be
plain
white
and
if
paper
is
used
pictures
should
be
discarded
lively
colors
if
not
too
glaring
give
a
cheerful
aspect
to
the
room
but
the
safer
plan
is
to
stick
to
simplicity
in
the
children
room
a
wood
wainscoting
is
desirable
part
of
this
may
be
a
blackboard
without
costing
more
and
at
the
top
a
shelf
can
be
placed
for
toys
figured
nursery
papers
cost
per
roll
from
to
cents
and
will
be
a
source
of
delight
if
the
walls
are
not
papered
they
should
be
painted
for
reasons
that
need
not
be
suggested
is
it
wonderful
how
far
a
boy
or
girl
can
reach
shades
and
curtains
we
have
not
advanced
much
in
the
production
of
window
shades
that
will
let
in
light
and
air
shut
out
the
gaze
of
strangers
hold
no
shadows
match
interior
and
exterior
fit
properly
work
with
ease
cost
little
and
last
forever
the
ordinary
opaque
roller
shade
still
has
no
serious
rival
and
usually
the
best
we
can
do
is
to
see
to
it
that
we
get
a
good
quality
which
is
not
always
reliable
rather
than
a
poor
quality
which
never
is
the
good
old
lace
curtains
that
were
the
pride
of
the
heart
and
the
jest
of
the
masculine
members
of
the
household
seem
to
have
had
their
day
it
has
been
a
long
one
and
any
article
that
holds
sway
for
so
lengthy
a
period
must
have
had
some
merit
but
the
soft
chintz
linen
madras
or
muslin
is
now
the
vogue
and
there
is
much
good
sense
in
the
innovation
no
lace
curtain
ever
made
could
be
both
artistic
and
serviceable
some
persons
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
they
never
were
either
but
we
have
too
much
reverence
for
tradition
to
be
so
iconoclastic
however
they
certainly
were
expensive
if
they
were
good
enough
to
have
were
difficult
to
wash
and
usually
caused
a
dead
line
to
be
drawn
about
the
very
choicest
part
of
the
room
linen
curtains
costing
from
cents
to
a
yard
may
be
had
in
a
set
or
conventional
design
or
plain
appliqué
chintz
and
muslin
cost
less
and
some
remarkably
pretty
effects
in
madras
are
obtainable
curtains
now
sensibly
stop
at
the
bottom
of
the
window
instead
of
dragging
upon
the
floor
besides
shades
and
curtains
the
window
question
involves
not
only
light
ventilation
and
artistic
relations
but
such
details
as
screens
and
storm
windows
these
latter
matters
come
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
architect
and
should
not
be
carelessly
settled
upon
each
room
has
its
uses
to
which
the
window
must
conform
as
nearly
as
may
be
and
then
the
outward
appearance
of
the
house
must
not
be
forgotten
it
is
often
made
or
marred
by
the
character
and
placing
of
the
windows
leaded
panes
and
casements
leaded
or
art
glass
is
attractive
if
not
overdone
small
panes
are
difficult
to
keep
clean
of
course
but
we
can
probably
endure
that
if
all
else
be
equal
in
living
rooms
the
upper
sash
should
be
made
smaller
than
the
lower
so
as
to
get
the
median
rail
above
the
level
of
the
eye
in
some
parts
of
the
house
a
horizontal
window
gives
a
fine
effect
besides
affording
light
and
air
without
affecting
privacy
casement
windows
have
their
points
of
excellence
and
are
additionally
expensive
chiefly
in
hardware
the
frames
are
really
cheaper
but
they
must
be
very
accurately
fitted
to
avoid
leaks
casement
windows
seriously
complicate
the
screen
and
problem
and
expert
planning
is
necessary
the
durability
of
screens
depends
mostly
upon
their
care
or
abuse
but
if
it
can
be
afforded
copper
wire
will
usually
last
sufficiently
longer
to
repay
its
additional
cost
metal
frames
are
not
so
essential
the
best
form
is
that
which
covers
the
entire
window
and
permits
both
sashes
to
be
freely
opened
but
this
costs
practically
twice
as
much
as
the
screen
storm
windows
storm
windows
should
be
carefully
fitted
or
they
will
come
far
from
serving
their
purpose
if
they
are
of
the
right
sort
they
will
soon
repay
their
cost
in
easing
up
the
furnace
preferably
they
should
be
swung
from
the
top
both
for
ventilation
and
washing
and
to
avoid
a
check
upon
egress
in
case
of
fire
some
persons
object
to
storm
windows
on
account
of
the
supposed
stoppage
of
ventilation
but
that
rests
entirely
with
the
occupants
of
the
house
they
can
get
plenty
of
fresh
air
without
letting
the
gales
of
winter
have
their
own
sweet
will
with
floors
walls
and
windows
determined
upon
we
have
a
good
start
on
the
interior
of
our
house
but
we
may
only
pause
to
take
breath
for
we
now
have
to
give
most
careful
consideration
to
two
decidedly
important
factors
in
our
comfort
lighting
and
heating
chapter
iii
lighting
and
heating
if
common
sense
has
governed
our
proceedings
to
date
the
new
house
we
are
building
or
the
one
we
have
chosen
will
have
full
advantage
of
the
one
perfect
light
that
afforded
by
the
sun
necessity
of
sunlight
the
properties
of
sunlight
are
so
well
known
to
all
of
us
that
we
wonder
why
so
many
otherwise
sensible
folk
seem
to
shun
it
with
trees
and
vines
awnings
and
blinds
denying
access
to
that
which
would
make
the
house
wholesome
when
possible
every
room
in
the
house
should
have
its
daily
ray
bath
and
our
apartments
should
utilize
the
light
of
the
sun
as
early
and
as
late
as
may
be
perhaps
nature
intended
all
creatures
to
sleep
through
the
hours
of
darkness
if
we
had
followed
that
custom
we
might
be
a
race
of
methuselahs
who
knows
why
some
one
has
not
established
a
cult
of
sleepers
from
sunset
to
dawn
is
really
inexplicable
but
mankind
in
general
has
persisted
in
holding
to
a
different
notion
and
since
the
sun
declines
to
shine
upon
us
during
all
the
hours
of
the
and
we
insist
upon
cutting
the
night
short
at
one
end
we
have
had
to
devise
substitutes
for
the
sunlight
of
course
the
sunlight
does
not
always
leave
us
in
unbroken
darkness
few
of
us
are
so
far
departed
from
the
days
of
mellow
youth
as
to
forget
certain
summer
evenings
linked
in
memory
with
verandas
or
bowered
walks
when
moonlight
and
even
that
in
a
modified
form
was
the
ideal
illumination
but
even
if
we
could
employ
the
good
fairies
to
dip
them
up
for
us
we
should
find
the
soft
moongleams
of
the
summer
evening
a
rather
doubtful
aid
in
searching
for
the
cat
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
basement
omitting
pine
knots
which
are
rather
out
of
vogue
modern
home
lighting
includes
four
forms
candles
oil
lamps
gas
and
electricity
the
are
not
it
is
true
used
to
any
extent
for
what
may
be
called
the
practical
purposes
of
lighting
but
in
many
ways
their
light
is
most
beautiful
of
all
some
charming
candelabra
suited
to
the
dining
table
are
found
in
the
better
shops
and
an
investment
in
a
choice
design
is
a
very
justifiable
extravagance
candle
illumination
is
of
all
varieties
the
one
least
trying
to
the
eyes
and
to
the
complexion
though
its
effect
upon
the
temper
of
the
person
tending
the
candles
is
not
so
sure
to
be
happy
however
the
sort
with
a
hollow
center
called
helion
candles
require
little
attention
and
the
patented
candle
holders
which
work
automatically
give
no
trouble
at
all
kerosene
notwithstanding
there
are
some
points
in
favor
of
the
old
reliable
kerosene
lamp
even
when
put
in
the
scale
with
other
illuminants
few
people
of
the
younger
generation
regard
it
as
other
than
something
to
be
endured
in
view
of
the
facts
that
an
oil
lamp
requires
a
great
deal
of
attention
usually
leaves
its
trail
of
oil
and
smoke
is
disagreeably
hot
in
summer
and
always
somewhat
dangerous
it
is
strange
that
those
who
cling
to
it
as
to
a
fetich
are
usually
the
ones
who
have
longest
struggled
with
its
imperfections
the
pretext
for
this
conservatism
whether
it
be
spoken
or
reserved
is
economy
if
we
are
of
this
class
we
may
be
shocked
to
discover
that
after
all
kerosene
lighting
is
really
no
cheaper
than
gas
or
electric
light
if
sufficient
illumination
is
afforded
and
insufficient
lighting
is
surely
economy
gas
and
matches
few
communities
of
respectable
size
are
now
without
gas
or
electricity
and
even
in
the
country
the
latter
is
almost
everywhere
obtainable
if
not
an
individual
gas
plant
of
which
there
are
several
makes
may
be
installed
at
a
moderate
cost
properly
placed
such
a
plant
is
safe
and
easily
regulated
and
will
furnish
light
for
somewhat
less
than
the
usual
charge
of
the
gas
companies
gas
has
never
fully
supplanted
kerosene
even
where
it
is
readily
obtained
why
this
is
true
we
need
not
pause
to
discuss
perhaps
a
fairly
suspicion
of
the
meter
has
had
something
to
do
with
it
but
certainly
no
one
building
a
house
in
these
days
would
fail
to
pipe
it
for
gas
if
the
supply
were
at
hand
even
if
it
were
to
be
used
only
for
kitchen
fuel
gas
has
its
virtues
as
an
illuminant
also
and
is
favored
by
many
on
account
of
the
softness
of
the
light
but
while
gas
is
preferable
to
kerosene
electricity
is
with
equal
certainty
preferable
to
gas
it
is
more
adaptable
is
in
many
places
quite
as
reasonable
in
cost
and
is
cleaner
and
safer
in
numerous
country
communities
where
gas
is
not
to
be
had
electricity
is
available
as
frequently
a
large
region
embracing
several
towns
is
supplied
from
a
single
generating
plant
gas
is
subject
to
fluctuations
in
quality
sometimes
becoming
quite
dangerous
in
its
effect
upon
the
atmosphere
water
gas
which
is
very
generally
manufactured
is
said
to
carry
four
or
five
times
as
much
carbon
monoxide
per
unit
of
bulk
as
retort
gas
it
has
for
the
hemoglobin
of
the
blood
four
hundred
times
the
affinity
of
oxygen
and
a
proportion
of
only
two
tenths
of
one
per
cent
may
produce
heart
derangement
while
we
are
wondering
that
we
are
alive
in
the
face
of
such
dreadful
facts
we
may
note
further
that
gas
is
rather
variable
in
its
qualities
as
an
illuminant
we
have
mentioned
the
suspicious
gas
meter
whose
vagaries
doubtless
have
caused
more
virtuous
indignation
with
less
impression
upon
its
object
than
anything
ever
devised
an
open
flame
is
always
a
menace
and
then
there
is
the
burnt
match
most
housekeepers
i
am
sure
would
testify
to
their
belief
that
matches
were
not
made
in
heaven
is
there
anything
that
so
persistently
defies
the
effort
for
tidiness
as
the
charred
remains
of
a
match
invariably
ignited
elsewhere
than
on
the
sandpaper
conspicuously
provided
and
more
likely
to
be
tossed
upon
the
floor
or
laid
upon
the
mahogany
table
than
to
find
its
way
into
the
receptacles
that
yearn
for
it
for
cooking
however
gas
must
still
be
a
main
dependence
and
for
this
reason
as
well
as
to
provide
for
remote
emergencies
the
house
should
be
piped
for
gas
at
least
it
should
be
brought
into
the
house
even
if
the
piping
is
not
continued
farther
than
the
kitchen
electric
light
in
seeking
to
secure
sufficient
light
we
often
go
to
the
extreme
of
providing
a
glare
that
is
trying
to
the
eyes
and
would
test
the
beauty
of
the
loveliest
complexion
that
ever
charmed
in
the
revealing
light
of
day
we
go
further
mayhap
and
concentrate
the
glare
upon
the
center
of
the
room
with
a
shade
of
bright
green
which
gives
an
unearthly
but
not
a
heavenly
cast
to
all
the
unfortunate
humans
who
come
under
its
belying
influence
objection
is
sometimes
made
to
electric
light
that
it
is
too
powerful
and
that
it
is
difficult
to
modify
and
control
this
impression
is
due
to
the
tendency
of
which
we
have
spoken
the
working
out
of
the
thought
that
proper
lighting
is
a
question
of
quantity
for
some
persons
the
ideal
arrangement
would
seem
to
be
a
searchlight
at
each
corner
of
the
room
with
a
few
arc
lights
suspended
from
a
mirrored
ceiling
electric
light
to
furnish
the
most
agreeable
effects
must
be
softened
and
properly
diffused
if
the
light
units
that
so
perfectly
illumine
a
room
during
the
day
were
concentrated
they
would
make
a
blinding
glare
but
diffused
they
are
properly
tempered
to
the
eye
the
common
thought
seems
to
be
to
put
all
the
lights
of
the
living
room
in
the
center
and
to
make
them
so
powerful
that
they
will
penetrate
every
corner
of
the
room
and
make
it
light
as
day
in
consequence
the
center
is
overlighted
and
instead
of
a
similitude
of
daylight
we
have
unreality
pleasing
arrangement
for
the
and
library
table
some
form
of
drop
light
is
essential
there
are
arrangements
that
will
transform
the
banquet
or
student
lamp
into
an
electric
drop
light
or
the
special
outfits
for
this
use
may
be
had
in
some
very
artistic
designs
for
general
lighting
wall
sconces
lanterns
or
brackets
are
preferable
some
of
these
are
very
beautiful
though
there
is
a
tendency
to
overelaboration
design
of
course
should
be
in
keeping
with
the
general
decoration
and
outfitting
of
the
room
instead
of
four
lights
in
a
center
chandelier
eight
of
power
will
spread
the
illumination
better
and
add
little
to
the
expense
except
for
fixtures
in
beamed
ceilings
which
are
not
too
high
the
effect
of
lights
placed
upon
the
beams
is
pleasing
though
the
effect
upon
the
monthly
bill
may
not
have
the
same
aspect
electric
lamps
at
the
sides
should
be
at
a
fair
height
and
throw
their
light
downward
instead
of
wasting
it
upon
the
ceiling
the
pretty
lanterns
of
antique
design
are
expensive
the
simplest
sort
costing
or
apiece
there
are
numerous
artistic
brackets
however
that
may
be
had
for
smaller
amounts
bulbs
are
made
in
all
sorts
of
shapes
to
fit
recesses
or
for
special
purposes
and
the
designs
in
shades
and
candelabra
are
legion
adaptability
electricity
strong
card
is
its
adaptability
it
can
go
wherever
a
wire
may
be
carried
and
into
many
places
where
gas
or
oil
lights
would
not
be
safe
or
practical
the
only
thing
lacking
is
to
make
it
wireless
and
perhaps
invention
sooner
or
later
will
be
equal
to
that
demand
early
installations
were
rather
carelessly
made
but
municipal
and
underwriters
rules
are
now
so
strict
that
practically
all
danger
of
fire
has
been
eliminated
the
householder
in
the
country
should
make
sure
that
the
underwriters
prescriptions
are
fully
observed
as
his
insurance
may
be
affected
in
the
city
official
inspection
usually
guarantees
correct
wiring
probably
only
in
the
hall
dining
room
and
living
room
will
we
be
greatly
concerned
with
the
decorative
phase
of
lighting
elsewhere
the
question
is
largely
one
of
practical
use
though
considerations
of
taste
are
not
to
be
neglected
careful
study
should
be
given
to
the
adaptation
of
lighting
to
the
future
uses
of
the
rooms
this
will
perhaps
avoid
the
use
later
of
unsightly
extension
cord
though
this
avoidance
can
scarcely
be
made
complete
protection
a
very
useful
light
may
be
provided
for
the
veranda
just
outside
the
door
illuminating
the
front
steps
and
path
to
the
sidewalk
this
light
may
be
turned
off
and
on
by
a
switch
key
inside
the
door
it
is
particularly
comforting
when
some
stranger
rings
the
doorbell
late
at
night
and
one
does
not
feel
overpleased
to
be
called
upon
to
open
the
door
to
an
invisible
person
other
switch
arrangements
make
it
possible
to
turn
on
the
upper
hall
lights
from
below
or
the
lower
hall
lights
from
above
and
the
lights
in
each
room
from
the
hall
when
there
are
unseemly
noises
downstairs
in
the
wee
sma
hours
it
is
much
more
agreeable
to
gaze
over
the
balustrade
into
a
bright
hall
than
to
go
prowling
about
in
the
darkness
for
the
bulb
or
gas
jet
with
the
chance
of
grasping
a
burglar
instead
some
burglars
are
very
sensitive
about
familiarities
on
the
part
of
strangers
and
it
is
always
better
to
permit
them
to
depart
in
a
good
humor
the
basement
lighting
too
should
be
regulated
from
above
and
the
dark
corners
should
be
well
looked
after
at
best
the
basement
is
a
breeder
of
trouble
if
the
light
is
in
the
center
and
must
be
turned
off
at
the
bulb
the
return
to
the
stairway
from
the
nocturnal
visit
to
the
furnace
is
likely
to
be
productive
of
bruised
shins
and
objurgative
english
if
the
light
operates
from
above
one
either
forgets
to
turn
it
off
and
leaves
it
to
burn
all
night
or
becomes
uncertain
about
it
just
as
he
is
beginning
to
doze
off
necessitating
a
scramble
downstairs
to
make
sure
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
have
a
choice
of
systems
some
houses
have
been
so
wired
that
one
can
illuminate
every
room
from
the
hall
or
from
the
master
bedroom
this
necessitates
complicated
wiring
and
will
not
be
found
necessary
by
most
of
us
neither
will
we
desire
to
spend
our
hardly
won
cash
in
wiring
our
bed
for
reading
lights
or
to
put
lights
under
the
dining
table
for
use
in
searching
for
the
lost
articles
that
always
by
some
instinct
seek
the
darkest
spots
in
the
room
if
there
be
a
barn
or
shed
on
the
lot
an
extension
carried
there
will
be
found
convenient
and
comparatively
inexpensive
in
the
kitchen
and
pantries
the
lights
should
be
considered
in
detail
so
that
all
the
various
operations
may
be
served
shadowed
sinks
and
ranges
and
dark
pantries
are
not
necessary
where
there
is
electric
light
regulated
light
in
halls
closets
and
bathroom
lamps
or
the
hylo
which
may
be
alternated
from
to
power
will
prove
an
economy
the
hylo
is
also
useful
in
bedrooms
where
children
are
put
to
sleep
affording
sufficient
light
to
daunt
the
hobgoblins
without
discouraging
the
approach
of
the
sandman
some
persons
can
not
sleep
without
a
light
for
them
and
for
the
sick
room
the
light
is
eminently
preferable
to
the
best
of
oil
lamps
there
are
numerous
conveniences
to
be
operated
by
electricity
such
as
chafing
dishes
flat
irons
up
heaters
up
electric
combs
for
drying
hair
heating
pads
in
lieu
of
bags
and
many
articles
for
the
kitchen
these
are
operated
from
flush
receptacles
in
baseboards
or
under
rugs
or
from
the
ordinary
light
sockets
the
two
sure
ways
of
heating
there
is
only
one
efficient
and
healthful
method
of
heating
a
house
and
that
is
with
a
furnace
i
have
that
on
the
authority
of
a
man
who
sells
furnaces
and
he
ought
to
know
substitute
steam
or
hot
water
for
furnace
and
we
have
the
assurance
of
the
man
across
the
way
who
sells
boilers
and
radiators
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
each
proves
his
case
to
one
entire
satisfaction
not
only
that
his
own
system
is
a
marvel
of
perfection
but
that
the
other
systems
are
dangerous
to
health
and
breeders
of
unhappiness
and
really
ought
though
he
would
like
to
say
so
to
be
prohibited
by
law
so
we
shall
have
to
decide
the
question
for
ourselves
if
we
err
we
can
still
abuse
the
dealer
or
the
architect
or
the
contractor
for
letting
us
make
a
mistake
the
furnace
the
furnace
costs
least
to
install
we
leave
stoves
out
of
consideration
it
is
also
supposed
to
be
easiest
to
manage
that
in
a
sense
is
true
a
good
furnace
will
act
pretty
well
even
under
indifferent
direction
a
bad
one
can
not
be
made
much
worse
by
the
greatest
of
stupidity
however
the
average
person
can
run
the
average
furnace
with
a
fair
degree
of
satisfaction
to
the
household
if
not
to
himself
for
a
house
of
six
to
eight
rooms
the
furnace
may
be
considered
an
efficient
means
of
heating
it
requires
more
fuel
than
some
other
apparatus
but
there
are
compensations
since
ventilation
and
heating
are
inevitably
associated
the
argument
that
the
furnace
provides
for
ventilation
is
a
strong
one
if
the
air
is
taken
from
outdoors
passed
over
the
radiating
surface
into
the
rooms
and
then
sent
on
its
way
something
like
perfect
ventilation
is
assured
if
the
air
is
simply
taken
from
the
basement
a
poor
place
to
go
for

the
success
of
the
furnace
depends
not
upon
ability
to
keep
up
a
rousing
fire
but
upon
a
proper
regulation
of
air
currents
many
a
furnace
properly
installed
fails
to
work
satisfactorily
because
the
principle
of
heating
is
not
understood
even
with
the
best
of
knowledge
the
air
is
hard
to
regulate
and
the
very
principle
that
gives
the
furnace
its
standing
as
a
ventilator
must
prevent
it
from
being
a
perfect
heater
unless
some
artificial
moisture
is
provided
not
only
will
the
air
be
too
dry
for
comfort
and
health
but
an
excessive
degree
of
heat
must
be
attained
in
order
to
warm
the
rooms
thus
increasing
the
consumption
of
coal
a
water
pan
is
usually
provided
in
the
furnace
but
too
often
it
is
neglected
direction
of
heat
if
any
mistake
in
selection
of
size
is
to
be
made
it
should
be
in
favor
of
excess
most
authorities
urge
the
choice
of
at
least
a
size
above
that
indicated
by
the
heating
area
a
chimney
with
suitable
draught
is
imperative
the
furnace
should
be
placed
in
a
central
location
and
should
be
set
sufficiently
low
to
permit
the
essential
rise
of
the
heat
ducts
if
the
basement
is
low
the
furnace
should
be
depressed
while
the
heat
conveyors
should
not
ascend
directly
from
the
furnace
they
should
not
be
carried
any
farther
than
necessary
in
a
horizontal
position
the
velocity
of
heat
is
diminished
in
carrying
it
horizontally
increased
vertically
crooks
and
turns
add
to
the
friction
and
decrease
heating
power
therefore
the
pipes
should
be
as
short
and
direct
as
possible
it
is
not
necessary
to
carry
the
register
to
a
window
on
the
farther
side
of
the
room
say
some
authorities
as
the
warm
air
rises
to
the
ceiling
anyway
and
the
greater
length
of
carry
involves
a
loss
in
warmth
pipes
for
the
first
floor
should
he
large
those
for
the
upper
rooms
having
a
longer
vertical
range
may
be
smaller
all
the
pipes
should
be
double
with
an
inch

a
protection
against
fire
asbestos
paper
on
a
single
pipe
is
not
regarded
as
a
sufficient
precaution
as
it
is
easily
torn
and
quickly
wears
out
registers
there
are
arguments
in
favor
of
registers
they
save
floor
space
and
obviate
some
dust
on
the
other
hand
they
are
not
quite
so
effective
in
heating
as
the
other
sort
since
the
pipes
for
floor
registers
may
be
of
larger
diameter
and
as
a
rule
require
fewer
bends
each
register
should
have
a
separate
pipe
from
the
furnace
where
direct
heat
is
not
desired
a
register
opening
in
the
ceiling
of
a
downstairs
room
will
sometimes
carry
enough
heat
to
the
upper
chamber
to
make
it
comfortable
for
sleeping
purposes
since
furnace
efficiency
is
largely
dependent
upon
air
control
a
strong
wind
sometimes
makes
it
difficult
to
heat
portions
of
the
house
to
meet
this
emergency
there
is
a
combination
and
heater
which
supplies
radiators
on
the
upper
floors
or
elsewhere
if
desired
the
additional
cost
is
practically
all
in
the
installation
as
the

hot

heat
cost
more
for

but
have
many
advantages
over
the
furnace
their
chief
drawbacks
are
the
space
usurped
by
radiators
lack
of
ventilation
and
the
possibility
of
an
occasional
breakdown
the
ingenuity
of
the
makers
however
is
partly
overcoming
these
difficulties
mainly
by
the
device
called
the
indirect
system
we
need
not
fret
ourselves
here
with
a
technical
elucidation
of
either
form
of
heating
we
may
however
consider
some
of
the
claims
made
for
hot
water
which
is
apparently
coming
to
be
considered
the
preferable
arrangement
for
dwelling
houses
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
essential
features
of
steam
and
systems
it
is
declared
that
water
will
absorb
more
heat
than
any
other
substance
hence
will
take
from
the
boiler
practically
all
the
heat
produced
in
the
combustion
of
fuel
as
the
temperature
of
the
water
is
automatically
controlled
the
atmosphere
of
the
rooms
may
be
kept
at
the
desired
degree
the
presence
of
radiators
in
each
room
all
of
the
same
temperature
giving
an
even
heat
over
the
entire
house
there
can
be
no
sudden
drop
in
temperature
as
the
water
in
the
pipes
continues
to
distribute
warmth
even
after
the
fire
has
been
checked
or
has
been
allowed
to
go
out
the
fuel
required
for
an
ordinary
stove
it
is
asserted
will
warm
an
entire
house
with
hot
water
an
engineer
is
not
required
inexperienced
persons
have
no
difficulty
in
operating
the
ordinary
boiler
and
there
is
no
danger
whatever
because
the
makers
adduce
for
steam
heat
the
maximum
pressure
is
about
five
pounds
while
with
hot
water
there
is
practically
no
pressure
at
all
very
little
water
is
used
and
a
connection
with
the
street
water
system
is
not
imperative
though
convenient
indirect
heating
indirect
heating
is
provided
by
passing
air
over
radiators
attached
to
the
ceiling
of
the
basement
thence
to
the
upper
rooms
in
the
system
the
radiators
are
placed
in
the
partition
walls
of
the
rooms
they
are
to
heat
the
cold
air
being
brought
through
a
duct
and
being
heated
passing
into
the
rooms
these
two
systems
are
economical
of
space
and
afford
provision
for
excellent
ventilation
they
are
considerably
more
expensive
however
than
the
direct
system
which
involves
exposed
radiators
radiators
are
now
constructed
in
many
different
forms
to
fit
under
windows
in
corners
in
fireplaces
under
cabinets
and
so
on
much
effort
has
been
directed
also
toward
relieving
their
painful
ugliness
and
if
of
a
neat
design
appropriately
colored
they
need
not
be
a
serious
blot
upon
the
decorative
scheme
of
a
room
radiators
in
the
direct
system
should
be
placed
far
enough
from
the
walls
to
permit
free
circulation
over
the
heating
surfaces
and
should
not
be
directly
covered
at
the
top
ordinarily
there
are
good
reasons
for
putting
them
near
the
more
exposed
places
such
as
windows
and
outer
doors
as
both
steam
and
hot
water
furnish
a
dry
heat
provision
should
be
made
in
every
room
for
evaporation
of
water
summary
with
no
prejudice
against
good
furnaces
it
may
be
said
that
hot
water
apparently
affords
the
greatest
possibilities
for
comfort
and
regularity
of
heating
and
that
there
are
usually
no
reasons
why
it
can
not
be
utilized
in
country
houses
a
installation
is
likely
to
cost
twice
as
much
as
a
furnace
but
if
we
are
to
live
in
the
house
it
is
better
to
make
our
estimates
cover
ten
or
twenty

rather
than
to

triumph

through

runs

each

it
can
expect
to
do

than
take

will
best
serve
the

adding
an
original

we
find
in
the

of
the
georgian

or
of

or
even
of
the
ancient
greeks
such
suggestions
as
will
help
us
to
live
this
life
more
comfortably
and
agreeably
we
may
with
good
conscience
borrow
or
imitate
ancient
designs
some
very
eminent
authorities
assure
us
that
many
of
the
objects
of
our
admiration
in
museums
and
in
private
collections
are
remnants
of
the
furnishings
of
the
common
households
of
the
olden
times
if
the
breadth
of
knowledge
of
the
eminent
authorities
is
indicated
by
this
assertion
they
must
have
touched
only
the
high
places
in
history
so
far
as
it
records
social
conditions
the
truth
is
that
the
household
appurtenances
which
have
survived
to
our
time
are
mostly
those
of
the
few
and
not
of
the
many
of
the
palace
and
mansion
and
not
of
the
cot
these
articles
were
costly
then
and
they
would
be
costly
now
and
very
often
quite
as
useless
as
costly
they
were
not
found
in
the
cottage
of
the
older
days
and
they
do
not
belong
in
the
cottages
of
the
present
nevertheless
many
of
these
old
designs
exemplify
the
elementary
essentials
of
furniture
good
materials
gracefulness
and
thorough
workmanship
these
are
qualities
that
are
to
be
sought
for
the
cottage
as
well
as
for
the
mansion
and
while
they
may
add
to
the
purchase

of
the
separate
articles
it
is
possible
to
secure
them
at
no
great
increase

of

realize
that
there
is
no

in

the

man
at

can
not
delude
himself
into
the
belief
that
there
is
comfort
to
be
found
in
a
great
deal
of
the
stuff
paraded
as
artistic
let
us
not
be
understood
however
as
hinting
that
artistic
qualities
must
be
disregarded
though
furniture
should
not
be
chosen
for
its
beauty
or
associations
alone
it
must
not
be
considered
at
all
if
beauty
is
absent
comfort
aesthetic
and
physical
the
first
consideration
of

is
comfort
let
no
one
dispute
that
fact
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
aesthetically
as
well
as
physically
comfortable
conceptions
of
physical
comfort
differ
with
individuals
but
are
usually
well
defined
some
of
us
actually
have
no
conception
whatever
of
aesthetic
comfort
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
seek
it
probably
we
had
a
very
faint
idea
of
what
good
music
or
good
painting
was
like
until
we
came
to
an
acquaintance
with
the
masters
but
we
are
surely
not
sorry
to
have
progressed
in
experience
and
feeling
and
so
it
is
that
though
we
may
not
feel
specially
urged
to
insist
upon
tasteful
surroundings
the
higher
instincts
within
us
that
persuade
us
to
make
the
most
of
ourselves
demand
that
we
shall
not
be
content
with
mere
physical
comfort
therefore
we
may
need
to
look
a
bit
beyond
our
definite
inward
aspirations

we
should
not

follow

to

it
takes

california
with
its
pretty
little
bungalows
not
only
has
pointed
out
to
us
the
possibility
of
living
satisfactorily
in
a
small
number
of
rooms
but
has
shown
us
something
in
the
way
of
simple
furnishings
not
until
we
see
what
may
be
done
without
do
we
realize
how
much
that
is
superfluous
crowds
our
floors
a
pretty
good
rule
is
to
test
everything
first
by
its
usefulness
if
it
is
not
useful
we
may
dispense
with
its
purchase
even
at
that
it
may
be
necessary
to
demand
that
the
article
shall
be
not
only
useful
but
absolutely
indispensable
for
between
the
beguiling
advertisement
and
the
crafty
salesman
almost
anything
that
is
manufactured
may
be
proved
necessary
at
the
best
we
shall
probably
purchase
and
the
question
of
when
a
house
reaches
the
point
of
overfurnishing
is
a
difficult
one
to
settle
let
one
of
us
for
instance
venture
at
midnight
into
a
dark
room
be
the
apartment
ever
so
large
with
nothing
but
a
rocker
in
it
and
the
impression
may
be
gained
that
the
place
has
been
turned
into
a
furniture
warehouse
and
some
persons
none
of
us
to
be
sure
are
never
happy
while
any
of
the
floor
or
wall
space
is
unoccupied
so
the
world
goes
but
if
nine
out
of
ten
persons
bought
only
what
they
could
not
do
without
what
they
did
purchase
could
be
of
a
great
deal
better
quality
no
bit
of
furniture
should
be
purchased
for
which
there
is
not
a
suitable
place
in
the
house
a
piece
may
be
very
attractive
in
the
salesroom
and
its
practical
qualities
may
appear
irresistible
while
on
our
own
floors
it
may
be
perfectly
incongruous
and
perhaps
on
account
of
its
enforced
location
almost
useless
if
for
no
other
reason
we
should
go
slow
with
our
purchases
because
we
can
not
know
the
real
needs
of
our
home
until
we
have
lived
in
it
experience
will
make
some
articles
superfluous
and
substitute
what
we
had
not
thought
to
want
there
should
be
a
regular
saving
fund
or
appropriation
for
keeping
up
the
house
fittings
and
usually
it
is
found
that
this
fund
grows
more
steadily
if
we
have
some
definite
purchases
in
view
leave
some
things
to
be
saved
up
for
there
will
be
less
likelihood
then
of
your
being
included
in
that
large
class
to
which
the
newspaper
small
ads
appeal
those
who
wish
to
trade
what
they
do
want
for
what
they
do
want
hall
furniture
in
a
hall
of
the
simpler
sort
the
only
requirements
are
a
chair
or
settee
a
table
for
de
an
umbrella
receptacle
and
a
mirror
wall
hanger
with
hooks
for
the
use
of
guests
the
halltree
is
no
more
and
long
may
it
rest
in
peace
if
there
had
been
no
other
reasons
for
its
passing
its
abuse
in
the
average
household
made
it
an
eyesore
intended
only
for
the
convenience
of
the
transient
guest
its
hooks
were
usually
preëmpted
by
the
entire
outer
wardrobe
of
the
family
a
good
plan
is
to
have
a
coat
closet
built
in
under
the
stairway
or
elsewhere
near
the
place
of
egress
leaving
the
few
inconspicuous
hooks
in
the
hall
to
afford
ample
provision
for
visitors
an
appropriation
of
to
will
fit
up
a
small
hall
very
satisfactorily
a
pretty
hanging
lantern
of
hammered
copper
with
open
bottom
and
globe
of
opalescent
glass
will
add
more
than
its
cost
of
to
the
good
impression
the
hall
is
to
make
upon
those
it
receives
the
family
chairs
some
good
folk
would
banish
the
rocker
unceremoniously
from
the
living
room
and
we
might
not
miss
it
so
much
as
we
think
it
is
the
adaptability
of
the
rocker
to
comforting
positions
rather
than
a
love
of
rocking
that
endears
the
chair
to
the
majority
and
when
the
same
qualities
are
found
in
the
reclining
or
easy
chair
we
can
well
spare
the
projections
that
menace
skirts
and
polished
furniture
not
to
speak
of
the
space
they
take
up
as
a
general
thing
it
is
the
man
of
the
house
whose
comfort
is
most
sedulously
looked
after
for
him
the
easy
chair
the
slippers
the
reading
lamp
the
smoking
outfit
the
house
jacket
the
evening
paper
this
fact
is
mentioned
in
no
carping
spirit
far
be
it
from
one
of
the
less
worthy
sex
to
quarrel
with
the
fate
that
has
been
ordained
for
us
by
our
helpmeets
the
latter
should
not
be
deprived
of
a
whit
of
the
joy
that
comes
from
viewing
the
lord
of
the
household
agreeably
situated
and
in
that
blissful
state
which
breeds
a
kindly
spirit
toward
all
human
kind
including
milliners
and
ladies
tailors
but
too
frequently
the
mistress
of
the
household
is
supposed
to
pick
up
her
comfort
at
odd
times
or
more
likely
there
is
any
supposition
at
all
for
her
for
the
master
and
for
the
other
members
of
the
family
there
must
be
a
personal
interest
in
the
living
room
and
this
is
best
represented
by
the
most
comfortable
chair
to
be
had
as
persons
are
built
of
different
heights
and
breadths
so
the
chairs
should
be
while
the
slender
chap
can
snuggle
down
in
the
most
capacious
easy
chair
the
stout
lady
may
be
embarrassed
when
she
finds
the
one
single
seat
at
hand
proffering
only
a
scanty
breadth
one
may
well
provide
for
these
contingencies
for
of
course
it
is
not
always
possible
to
select
our
acquaintances
in
accordance
with
the
capacity
of
our
furniture
heights
too
should
be
varied
somewhat
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
joy
of
life
for
others
is
much
increased
by
the
sight
of
a
tall
gentleman
of
dignity
gradually
unfolding
himself
from
the

that
was
purchased
for
the
particular
use

gwendolyn
ermyntrude
aged

the
table
if
the
living
room
among
its
other
uses
takes
the
place
of
the

the
selection
of
a
suitable
library
table
will
be
a
good
test
of
the
homemaker
discrimination
the
quality
of
this
table
should
be
at
least
equal
to
the
best
we
have
to
show
whether
it
shall
be
squared
or
oblong
with
oval
ends
depends
upon
tastes
by
all
means
it
should
be
that
what
a
library
table
is
for
good
designs
in
arts
and
crafts
may
be
had
as
low
as
in
a
small

will
not
leave
much
change

it
would
be
better

to
go

the
chemicals
used
in
the
bleaching
process
are
made
overstrong
to
hasten
whitening
with
the
result
that
the
fibers
rot
after
a
while
and
little
cracks
appear
in
the
fabric
this
is
not
usual
but
of
course
the
unbleached
damask
precludes
all
possibility
of
such
an
occurrence

damask
by
the

takes
its

from
the
city
of
damascus
where
the
fabric
was
first
made

is
simply
linen
so
woven
that
a
pattern
is
produced
by
the
different
directions
of
the
thread
plain
damask
being
the

but
unfigured
the
expression
double
damask
need
occasion
no
alarm
it
does
not
imply
double
cost
a
double
cloth
or
double
anything
except
a
double
or
duplicate
design
produced
by
the
introduction
of
an
extra
thread
so
woven
in
that
the
figure
appears
exactly
the
same
on
both
sides
of
the
cloth
making
it
reversible
quality
the
next
thing
will
be
to
decide
between
buying
by
the
yard
and
buying
a
pattern
cloth
in
which
the
border
continues
without
a
break
all
the
way
around
adding
about
ten

cent
to
the

the
designs
in
both

are
the
same

corresponding
qualities
we
are
knights
and

of
the
round
table
these
days
and
cloths
woven
specially
for
use
thereon
with

come
only
in

cloths
of
this
description
are
used
also
on
square
tables
as
the
wreath
effect
is
very
decorative
as
to
the
quality
of
damask
it
depends
not
so
much
upon
weight
for
the
finest
cloths
are
by
no
means
the
heaviest
as
upon
the
size
of
the
threads
and
the
closeness
and
firmness
with
which
they
are
woven
avoid
the
loosely
woven
fabric
it
will
neither
wear
nor
look
so
well
as
the
one
in
which
the
threads
are
more
compact
in
the
better
damasks
the
threads
are
smoother
and
finer

styles
in
table
linens
change
from
time
to
time
and
render
it
difficult
to
say
what
may
or
may
not
be
used
with
propriety
except
that
the
general
principle
of
coarse
designs
being
in
poor
taste
always
holds
good
one
pattern
alone
has
proven
itself
and
stood
the
test
of
time
so
satisfactorily
that
it
is
as
high
as
ever
in
the
good
housekeeper
favor

no

occasionally
we
meet
with
a

though
the

is
gradually
falling
into
disuse
as
being
too
stiff
to
twine
and

true

so
exquisitely

these

a
most
charming

in
order
to
secure
perfect

a
manufacturer
in
belfast
has
established
and
maintains
a
greenhouse
where
his
designers
draw
direct
from
the
natural
flower
this
care
is
but
the
outgrowth
of
the
more
refined
living
which
demands
that
beauty
shall
walk
with
utility
price
and
size
before
our
housekeeper
starts
she
must
lock
up
her
zeal
for
economy
lest
it
lead
her
away
from
the
straight
and
narrow
way
of
good
taste
into
that
broader
path
which
leads
to
the
bargain
counter
she
may
as
well
make
up
her
mind
at
once
that
desirable
table
linen
is
not
cheap
the
sorts
offered
at
a
very
low
price
being
neither
economical
nor
desirable
and
that
a
cheap
cloth
which
cheapens
all
of
its
surroundings
is
dearly
bought
at
any
price
occasionally
the
experienced
shopper
can
pick
up
at
a
sale
of
or
soiled
damasks
something
which
is
really
a
good
offering
particularly
during
the
annual
linen
sale
which
falls
in
january
but
as
a
rule
beware
of
bargains
the
fabric
is
liable
to
be
a
second
with
some
imperfection
or
to
contain
a
thread
of
cotton
which
gives
it
a
rough
look
when
laundered
and
there
is
generally
a
shortage
in
width
which
suggests
the
advisability
of
measuring
the

add

if

of

and
to
be
in
the
best
taste
should
never
be
more
than
an

high
these

are
either
plain
in

for
this

a

the

comes
where

off

chapter
vi
the
kitchen
the
old
condition
of
in
the
home
furnishing
when
the
largest
outlay
of
money
and
taste
was
put
into
the
front
room
and
the
kitchen
took
the
hindermost
has
gradually
given
way
before
the
fact
that
a
woman
is
known
not
by
the
but
by
the
kitchen
she
keeps
given
the
requisite
qualifications
for
the
proper
furnishing
care
and
ordering
of
her
kitchen
and
it
can
usually
be
said
of
her
with
truth
that
she
is
mistress
of
the
entire
and
situation
if
any
one
room
in
the
home
was
conceived
solely
for
the
relief
of
estate
that
room
is
the
kitchen
and
it
has
supplied
the
energy
which
has
sent
forth
many
a
one
to
fight
a
winning
battle
with
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
and
while
it
is
alas
too
true
that
it
is
the
rock
upon
which
many
a
domestic
ship
has
gone
to
pieces
it
is
the
true
foundation
of
the
home
and
therefore
of
the
nation
wherefore
let
us
first
look
well
to
our
kitchens
and
then
live
up
to
them
the
plan
the
kitchen
of
our
grandmothers
was
a
large
rambling
affair
with
numerous
storerooms
closets
and
pantries
the
care
of
which
involved
a
stupendous
outlay
of
time
and
strength
but
the
demands
of
our
modern
and
more
strenuous
life
necessitate
strict
economy
of
both
and
the
result
is
a
kitchen
sufficiently
large
for
all
practical
purposes
with
every
space
utilized
and
everything
convenient
to
the
hand
the
amount
of
woodwork
is
reduced
to
a
minimum
since
wood
is
a
harboring
place
for
insects
and
germs
where
it
must
be
used
it
is
of
hard
wood
or
of
pine
painted
and
varnished
the
varnish
destroying
those
qualities
in
paint
which
are
deleterious
to
health
the
plumbing
must
be
open
with
no
dark
corners
in
which
dust
may
hide
odors
from
cooking
pass
out
through
a
register
in
the
chimney
and
ventilation
is
afforded
by
transom
and
window
blessed
indeed
is
the
kitchen
with
opposite
windows
which
insure
a
perfect
circulation
of
air
so
much
for
the
general
working
plan
location
and
finish
for
some
reason
best
known
to
themselves
architects
almost
invariably
give
to
the
kitchen
the
location
with
the
least
agreeable
outlook
sun
and
scenery
being
seemingly
designed
for
the
exclusive
use
of
living
and
dining
rooms
whereas
the
housekeeper
realizes
the
great
value
of
the
sun
as
an
aid
to
sanitation
and
as
a
soul
strengthener
and
wishes
that
its
beneficent
influence
might
be
shed
over
kitchen
cook
and
cookery
but
the
frequent
impossibility
of
this
only
increases
the
necessity
for
simulating
sunshine
within
and
so
we
select
cream
white
warm
light
grays
or
browns
indian
red
or
bronze
green
which
is
particularly
good
with
oak
woodwork
for
walls
and
ceilings
waterproof
paper
may
be
used
but
is
not
particularly
durable
far
better
is
the
enameled
paint
requiring
three
coats
or
painted
burlap
or
our
thoughts
may
turn
with
longing
to
a
kitchen
with
its
air
of
spotless
purity
but
too
often
beyond
the
reach
of
you
and
me
why
not
substitute
for
it
the
white
marbled
oilcloth
which
produces
much
the
same
effect
and
can
be
smoothly
fitted
if
a
little
glue
is
added
to
the
paste
with
which
it
is
put
on
a
combination
of
white
woodwork
with
blue
walls
and
ceiling
is
charming
particularly
where
the
cooking
utensils
are
used
and
the
same
idea
can
be
carried
out
in
the
floor
covering
white
with
yellow
is
also
dainty
calcimine
is
not
desirable
in
the
kitchen
as
it
can
not
be
cleaned
and
is
therefore
unsanitary
two
tablespoonfuls
of
kerosene
added
to
the
cleaning
water
will
keep
woodwork
walls
and
ceilings
fresh
and
glossy
a
mopholder
fitted
with
a
coarse
carriage
sponge
will
facilitate
the
cleaning
of
the
latter
illustration
the
kitchen
the
floor
despite
the
fact
that
we
are
enjoined
to
look
up
not
down
the
floor
seems
to
be
the
focal
point
to
anyone
entering
the
kitchen
and
it
becomes
a
source
of
pride
or
humiliation
to
the
occupant
according
to
its
condition
a
beautiful
snowy
hardwood
floor
clean
enough
to
eat
on
is
a
delight
but
it
has
such
an
insatiable
appetite
for
spots
after
the
newness
has
worn
off
that
it
requires
frequent
scrubbing
twice
a
week
at
least
and
on
a
dry
day
if
possible
with
doors
and
windows
opened
during
the
operation
all
of
which
means
energy
misapplied
to
be
sure
the
new
colonial
rugs
woven
in
harmony
with
the
general
color
scheme
protect
the
floor
and
help
to
relieve
the
strain
of
much
standing
and
can
he
washed
and
dried
as
satisfactorily
as
any
piece
of
cotton
cloth
while
raw
oil
applied
with
a
soft
cloth
or
a
handful
of
waste
every
two
months
will
keep
the
floor
in
good
condition
but
the
housekeeper
who
chooses
the
better
part
covers
her
floor
with
linoleum
at
comparatively
small
cost
a
piece
good
both
in
quality
and
design
selling
at
cents
a
square
yard
in
this
too
the
color
idea
can
be
carried
out
the
smaller
designs
being
preferable
neutral
tints
follow
designs
are
neat
and
less
apt
to
soil
than
the
lighter
patterns
it
is
a
wise
plan
in
buying
to
allow
enough
linoleum
for
three
smaller
pieces
to
be
placed
before
stove
table
and
sink
thus
saving
wear
and
tear
on
the
large
piece
thus
covered
the
floor
is
easily
cleaned
with
a
damp
cloth
it
must
be
thoroughly
swept
once
a
day
followed
by
a
general
dusting
of
the

have

be
kept
bright
by
rubbing
with
whiting
and
alcohol
followed
by
a
vigorous
polishing
with
a
bit
of
flannel
it
surely
can
not
be
necessary
to
suggest
the
dangers
arising
from
an
untidy
sink
in
which
refuse
of
various
kinds
tea

parings
and
the

is
allowed
to
accumulate
unsanitary

about

breed
germs
which
are
a
menace
to
life

health
the

from
coffee

should
be
poured
into

keeps
them
from

never
be
poured
into

with
a

of

an
occasional

that

insects

their
extermination
it
is
not
just
pleasant
to
associate
cockroaches
and
ants
with
our
kitchens
and
pantries
but
where
heat
and
moisture
and
food
are
there
insects
will
be
also
for
they
seem
to
enjoy
a
taste
of
high

to
thrive
on
it
keep
the

after

with
a
weekly
boiling
in

water
dispose
carefully

all
food
and
then
wage
a
war

extermination
this
is
all
that
will
avail
in
an
house
hunt
out
if
possible
the
nests
or
breeding
places
of
ants
and
saturate
with
boiling

with
kerosene
wash
all
woodwork
shelves
and
drawers
with
water
and
inject
it
into
any
crack
or
opening
where
the
pests
appear
it
has
been
suggested
that
ants
can
be
kept
out
of
drawers
and
closets
by
a
dead
line
drawn
with
a
brush
dipped
in
corrosive
sublimate

muriate
of
ammonia
two
ounces
and
water

a
powder
of

emetic
dissolved
in

of
water
seems
to
be
effective
in
driving
them
away
sponges
wet
with
sweetened
water
attract
them
in
large
numbers
and
when
full
should
be
plunged
in
boiling
water
another
successful
trap
is
a
plate
thinly
spread
with
lard
this
also
to
be
dropped
into
boiling
water
when
filled
in
order
to
protect
the
table
from
an
invasion
stand
the
legs
in
dishes
of
tar
water
to
a
depth
of
four
inches
ants
have
a
decided
distaste
for
the
odors
of
pennyroyal
and
oil
of
cedar
a
few
drops
of
either
on
bits
of
cotton
frequently
sufficing
to
drive
them
away
entirely
as
for
cockroaches
there
appear
to
be
almost
as
many
exterminators
as
there
are
housewives
but
what
is
their
poison
in
one
home
seems
to
make
them
wax
and
grow
fat
in
another
borax
and
powdered
sugar
scattered
thickly
over
shelves
and
around
baseboards
and
sink
is
a
favorite
remedy
with
many
but
it
is
an
unsightly
mess
particularly
in
summer
when
the
sugar
melts
and
becomes
sticky
after
all
experience
has
demonstrated
that
the
one
really
effectual
method
of
extermination
is
to
besiege
the
roaches
in
their
own
bailiwick
the
pipes
and
woodwork
about
the
sink
with
a
large
bellows
filled
with

is
sewer
connection
for
it
some
authorities
maintain
that
there
is
grave
danger
from
sewer
gas
where
the
refrigerator
is
connected
directly
with
the
sewer
and
that
therefore
the
only
safe
way
to
dispose
of
the
waste
water
is
to
catch
it
in
a
pan
placed
beneath
the
refrigerator
unless
the
house
is
so
built
that
the
waste
pipe
can
be
continued
down
into
the
cellar
and
there
empty
its
contents
into
a
sink
a
good
refrigerator
interlined
with
charcoal
with
a
capacity
a
removable
ice
pan
which
facilitates
cleaning
and
three
shelves
is
to
be
had
for
in
selecting
a
refrigerator
it
is
well
to
choose
one
of
medium
size
as
a
larger
one
entails
waste
of
ice
while
a
smaller
necessitates
the
placing
near
together
of
foods
which
should
be
kept
apart
as
butter
and
milk
with
fish
fruit
etc
if
one
cares
to
invest
in
the
refrigerators
of
course
those
lined
with
tile
porcelain
or
enamel
are
very
desirable
as
they
are
easily
kept
clean
and
do
not
absorb
odors
but
for
the
average
income
and
use
a
refrigerator
answers
every
purpose
it
should
be
thoroughly
cleansed
on
the
mornings
when
the
ice
is
to
be
renewed
with
hot
sal
soda
water
followed
by
a
cold
bath
and
a
thorough
drying
the
drain
pipe
must
not
be
overlooked
but
given
the
same
sal
soda
treatment
otherwise
it
becomes
coated
and
a
fruitful
source
of
germs
if
after
this
has
been
done
a
musty
odor
still
clings
about
the
refrigerator
remove
the
shelves
and
boil
in
the
clothes
boiler
for
twenty
minutes
pieces
of
charcoal
placed
in
the
corners
of
the
refrigerator
and
frequently
renewed
will
absorb
much
of
the
odor
never
place
warm
food
in
the
refrigerator
nor
food
of
any
kind
on
the
shelves
unless
it
is
first
placed
on
a
plate
or
platter
it
is
economy
to
keep
the
ice
chamber
well
filled
and
all
ice
should
be
well
washed
before
being
placed
therein
some
housekeepers
cover
the
ice
with
newspapers
or
carpet
this
no
doubt
helps
to
preserve
it
but
it
also
keeps
the
cold
from
the
food
chambers
no
food
and
nothing
containing
it
should
ever
be
placed
directly
on
the
ice
furnishing
the
kitchen
and
now
having
cleaned
and
decorated
our
kitchen
and
pantry
and
provided
for
the
refrigeration
and
partial
disposal
of
our
food
suppose
we
turn
our
attention
to
the
fascinating
task
of
selecting
the
different
parts
of
the
machinery
which
turns
out
that
finished
masterpiece
a
perfect
meal
bearing
in
mind
in
the
meantime
that
the
saying
art
is
the
expression
of
joy
in
one
work
applies
to
nothing
more
truly
than
to
the
art
of
cookery
and
that
no
tools
necessary
to
its
perfect
success
nor
to
her
comfort
and
convenience
should
be
denied
that
master
artist
the
cook
be
she
mistress
or
maid
the
stove
of
paramount
importance
is
of
course
the
stove
and
what
kind
it
shall
be
whether
gas
coal
or
oil
those
of
us
who
have
grown
accustomed
to
the
immunity
from
those
inevitable
accompaniments
of
a
coal
range
ashes
soot
dust
and
heat
afforded
by
the
gas
range
with
its
easily
regulated
broiler
and
oven
could
hardly
be
persuaded
to
go
back
to
first
principles
as
it
were
and
the
coal
range
but
when
this
is
necessary
either
for
warmth
or
because
there
is
no
gas
connection
in
the
house
one
has
a
wide
choice
of
stoves
and
can
hardly
go
astray
in
selecting
one
dollars
will
buy
a
good
durable
stove
with
all
modern
improvements
and
a
large
oven
a
stove
with
the
same
capacity
but
manufactured
under
a
name
sells
for
while
between
the
two
in
price
is
one
at
two
firms
manufacture
in
connection
with
their
regular
line
of
ranges
a
gas
stove
which
can
be
attached
directly
to
the
range
and
sells
for
a
portable
steel
oven
covering
two
burners
for
use
on
gas
and
oil
stoves
alike
adds
to
the
convenience
of
the
gas
plate
and
sells
for
if
a
gas
range
is
desired
an
excellent
one
with
a
large
oven
broiler
and
all
conveniences
may
be
purchased
for
one
with
a
smaller
oven
for
it
might
be
well
to
suggest
in
passing
that
a
small
oven
is
poor
economy
water
backs
for
both
gas
and
coal
ranges
are
each
where
gas
is
unobtainable
a
wickless
plate
will
be
found
to
give
very
good
satisfaction
and
can
be
placed
on
the
coal
range
or
on
a
table
or
box
the
range
of
the
same
capacity
is
more
with
an
increase
in
price
corresponding
with
the
number
of
burners
until
we
have
the
stove
at
to
do
away
with
the
odor
which
is
apt
to
result
from
the
use
of
oil
as
fuel
remove
the
burners
boil
in
sal
soda
water
dry
thoroughly
and
return
to
the
stove
in
setting
up
a
stove
look
carefully
to
it
that
the
height
is
right
otherwise
the
cook
back
is
sure
to
suffer
if
too
low
blocks
can
be
placed
under
the
legs
to
raise
it
to
a
comfortable
height
a
whisk
broom
hung
near
the
stove
is
useful
in
removing
crumbs
dust
and
keeping
it
tidy
a
rack
behind
the
stove
on
which
to
hang
the
spoons
and
forks
used
in
cooking
is
a
great
convenience
and
a
saving
to
the
table
top
the
table
and
its
care
the
table
should
stand
on
casters
and
be
placed
in
a
good
light
as
far
from
the
stove
as
may
be
the
latest
product
of
the
genius
in
this
line
contains
two
drawers
one
spaced
off
into
compartments
for
the
different
knives
forks
and
spoons
for
kitchen
use
a
molding
board
and
three
bins
one
large
one
for
wheat
flour
and
two
smaller
one
for
graham
flour
corn
meal
etc
when
one
considers
the
economy
of
steps
between
kitchen
and
pantry
which
it
makes
possible
its
price
is
not
large
while
it
obviates
the
necessity
for
purchasing
bins
and
molding
board
our
friend
the
white
table
oilcloth
tacked
smoothly
in
place
gives
a
dainty
top
which
is
easily
kept
clean
with
a
damp
cloth
another
device
which
stands
between
cook
and
scrubbing
brush
a
zinc
table
cover
is
preferred
by
some
housewives
as
it
absorbs
no
grease
and
is
readily
brightened
with
scouring
soap
and
hot
water
separate
table
tops
can
be
had
for
the
table
is
not
desirable
for
though
it
undoubtedly
is
an
aid
to
the
making
of
good
pastry
it
stains
easily
dissolves
in
some
acids
and
clogs
with
oils
the
easiest
way
to
keep
the
table
clean
and
neat
is
simply
to
keep
it
so
when
the
mixing
of
cake
pudding
is
in
process
a
large
bowl
should
be
near
at
hand
and
into
it
should
go
egg
beater
spoons
and
forks
when
the
cook
is
through
using
them
after
which
they
with
all
other
soiled
utensils
should
be
carried
to
the
sink
washed
dried
and
put
away
never
lay
eggshells
upon
the
table
nor
allow
anything
to
dry
on
the
utensils
if
as
occasionally
happens
even
in
the
kitchens
one
is
baking
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
observe
all
these
precautions
a
heavy
paper
spread
on
the
table
will
catch
all
the
droppings
and
can
be
rolled
up
and
burned
jars
containing
sugar
spices
which
have
been
in
use
should
be
wiped
with
a
damp
cloth
before
returning
to
the
pantry
the
chairs
the
first
aid
to
the
cook
should
be
at
least
one
comfortable
chair
neither
a
rocking
chair
nor
one
upholstered
both
of
which
are
out
of
place
in
the
kitchen
but
one
low
enough
to
rest
in
easily
while
shelling
peas
or
doing
some
of
the
numerous
tasks
which
do
not
require
the
use
of
the
table
a
chair
of
this
kind
has
a
cane
seat
and
high
back
and
can
be
purchased
for
the
other
chair
to
be
of
the
regulation
kitchen
style
at
cents
the
second
aid
is
a
office
stool
at
cents
for
use
while
washing
dishes
preparing
vegetables
etc
this
sort
of
a
stool
is
light
easily
moved
about
and
means
a
great
saving
in
strength
though
it
has
sometimes
been
dubbed
a
nuisance
by
the
uninitiated
the
woman
who
has
learned
its
value
finds
it
a
very
present
help
and
wonders
how
she
ever
did
without
it
the
kitchen
cabinet
occasionally
it
happens
that
a
house
is
built
with
such
slight
regard
for
pantry
room
that
we
are
constrained
to
wonder
if
at
the
last
minute
the
pantry
was
not
tucked
into
a
little
space
for
which
there
was
absolutely
no
other
use
and
there
left
to
be
a
means
of
grace
to
the
thrifty
housewife
whose
pride
it
is
to
see
her
pots
and
pans
in
orderly
array
and
with
plenty
of
room
to
shine
in
at
this
point
there
comes
to
her
rescue
the
kitchen
cabinet
which
not
only
relieves
the
congestion
in
the
pantry
but
adds
in
no
small
measure
to
the
attractiveness
of
the
kitchen
these
cabinets
come
in
the
natural
woods
and
should
as
nearly
as
possible
match
the
woodwork
of
the
kitchen
many
have
the
satin
finish
which
renders
them
impervious
to
grease
and
all
are
fitted
out
with
molding
boards
shelves
cupboards
and
drawers
of
various
sizes
so
convenient
is
a
cabinet
of
this
kind
and
so
economical
of
steps
that
it
might
well
be
called
the
complete
housewife
first
and
foremost
it
accommodates
the
kitchen
dishes
plates
platters
and
saucers
standing
on
edge
of
course
with
cups
hanging
from
small
hooks
and
pitchers
bowls
variously
arranged
then
come
the
jars
of
spice
sugar
salt
tea
and
coffee
all
groceries
in
fact
which
are
in
most
frequent
use
where
the
decorative
design
in
both
jars
and
dishes
is
carried
out
in
the
blue
and
white
with
a
utensil
or
two
of
the
same
coloring
the
effect
is
truly
charming
though
this
is
of
course
a
matter
of
individual
taste
the
cupboards
are
handy
hiding
places
for
the
less
ornamental
bottles
brushes
while
the
base
which
is
really
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
very
complete
kitchen
table
usually
has
a
shelf
for
kettles
stone
jars
etc
a
good
cabinet
can
be
had
for
a
more
commodious
one
for
and
so
on
the
cabinets
without
bases
range
from
a
tiny
one
just
large
enough
to
hold
six
spice
jars
at
to
one
with
five
drawers
shelves
and
cupboards
with
glass
doors
for
any
price
beyond
this
simply
means
elaboration
of
design
without
additional
increase
of
capacity
or
convenience
kitchen
utensils
in
selecting
dishes
and
cooking
utensils
it
is
well
to
remember
that
cheapness
does
not
always
spell
economy
and
that
one
buys
not
alone
for
the
present
but
for
the
future
as
well
utensils
which
require
scouring
are
not
economical
either
for
scouring
is
friction
and
friction
means
loss
of
energy
scouring
has
gone
out
with
the
heavy
ironware
which
required
it
in
whose
stead
we
have
the
pretty
porcelain
enamel
ware
and
the
less
expensive
agate
ware
both
of
which
need
only
a
thorough
washing
in
hot
soapy
water
rinsing
in
boiling
water
and
careful
drying
ware
of
this
kind
helps
to
produce
the
kitchen
restful
and
so
indirectly
the
cook
rested
a
kitchen
is
always
more
or
less
attractive
but
why
not
make
it
rather
more
so
than
less
taste
and
harmony
add
nothing
to
the
expense
of
furnishing
and
there
is
a
certain
dignity
and
inspiration
as
well
as
satisfaction
in
being
able
to
bring
forth
butter
in
a
lordly
dish
kitchen
crockery
is
being
rapidly
supplanted
by
the
porcelain
enamel
dishes
which
though
rather
more
expensive
in
the
beginning
are
unbreakable
and
so
cheaper
in
the
long
run
they
are
even
invading
the
domain
of
the
faithful
yellow
mixing
bowl
and
becoming
decidedly
popular
therein
being
light
in
weight
and
more
easily
handled
the
complete
equipment
of
the
kitchen
is
a
more
costly
operation
than
one
is
apt
to
imagine
individual
items
amounting
comparatively
to
so
little
but
the
sum
total
is
usually
a
rather
surprising
figure
and
so
remembering
that
rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
carefully
select
those
things
which
are
really
the
essentials
of
every
day
adding
the
useful
bit
by
bit
the
size
and
number
of
utensils
must
be
governed
by
the
size
of
the
family
in
which
they
are
to
be
used
never
buy
anything
of
copper
for
kitchen
use
as
the
rust
to
which
it
is
liable
is
a
dangerous
poison
there
is
one
utensil
only
which
is
better
to
be
of
iron
the
soup
kettle
as
it
makes
possible
the
slow
simmering
which
is
necessary
for
good
soups
and
stews
it
is
not
worth
while
to
buy
knives
of
anything
but
wrought
steel
which
are
best
cleaned
with
pumice
stone
cheesecloth
for
fish
bags
and
strainers
and
strong
cotton
for
pudding
bags
must
not
be
overlooked
and
so
with
kitchen
complete
artistic
and
satisfactory
in
every
detail
it
remains
but
to
emphasize
two
facts
that
perfect
cleanliness
is
absolutely
essential
to
health
and
that
she
who
looketh
well
to
the
ways
of
her
kitchen
eateth
not
the
bread
of
idleness
the
following
list
may
be
too
extensive
for
some
purposes
not
suited
to
others
but
out
of
it
the
new
housekeeper
can
select
what
she
thinks
her
establishment
will
need
and
estimate
the
price
of
stocking
her
kitchen

what
visions
of
dampness
and
disorder
of
air
malodorous
with
steam
and
soap
of
meals
delayed
and
hurriedly
prepared
of
tempers
ruffled
and
the
domestic
machinery
all
disarranged
and
the
discomforts
of
home
prominently
in
the
foreground
are
called
forth
by
that
magic
word

and
yet
maligned
though
it

it
really
is
the
day
of
all
the

the
best
for

more
than
any

to
our

or
blue
but
we
very
soon
come
out
of
the
azure
when
it
is
achieved
and
we
find
ourselves
entering
upon
another
week
enjoyment
of
that
virtue
which
is
akin
to
godliness
in
the
brief
interim
of
upheaval
we
may
possibly
wish
we
could
hark
back
to
the
days
of
the
who
solved
his
individual
problem
of
personal
cleanliness
by
simply
dropping
his
soiled
clothing
into
a
boiling
spring
where
it
was
turned
and
churned
and
twisted
and
finally
flung
out
a
clean
and
purified
testimonial
to
mother
nature
ability
as
a
laundress
or
perhaps
the
pretty
pastoral
of
the
peasant
girl
knee
deep
in
the
brook
rubbing
her
household
linen
on
the
stones
hath
even
greater
charms
but
the
trouble
is
that
we
are
neither
nor
peasants
but
just
plain
housekeepers
with
a
laundry
problem
to
face
and
finding
that
it
like
most
other
problems
is
best
solved
by
attacking
it
boldly
systematically
and
according
to
certain
fixed
rules
illustration
the
laundry
laundry
requisites
the
home
laundry
must
be
well
ventilated
and
lighted
and
in
the
basement
if
possible
for
obvious
reasons
the
chief
being
the
relief
thus
afforded
to
the
otherwise
congested
kitchen
and
overburdened
kitchen
stove
while
at
the
same
time
one
other
menace
to
health
the
steam
generated
by
the
washing
and
drying
is
removed
from
the
main
part
of
the
house
it
is
highly
essential
that
the
laundry
be
properly
and
completely
equipped
for
the
work
of
washing
boiling
drying
and
ironing
stationary
tubs
are
much
to
be
desired
those
being
more
sanitary
than
either
soapstone
which
has
a
tendency
to
absorb
grease
or
wood
which
absorbs
the
uncleanness
from
the
soiled
linen
it
is
especially
necessary
that
the
tubs
be
as
impervious
as
possible
when
the
linen
is
soaked
overnight
if
tubs
are
to
be
bought
the
paper
ones
have
a
decided
advantage
over
the
more
cedar
ones
in
being
much
lighter
and
consequently
more
easily
handled
with
only
a
slight
difference
in
price
it
seems
so
well
worth
while
to
minimize
the
strain
of
heavy
lifting
when
and
wherever
one
can
since
washing
at
best
involves
much
hard
work
and
fatigue
the
stove
and
furnishings
the
stove
for
laundry
use
may
be
either
gas
oil
or
coal
the
latter
being
considered
the
most
economical
of
fuel
while
it
often
comes
in
very
handy
in
the
preparation
of
foods
which
require
long
stewing
or
simmering
the
wringer
should
be
of
medium
size
either
wooden
or
the
former
having
the
advantage
of
lightness
the
latter
of
strength
the
screws
must
be
loosened
after
each
washing
and
thoroughly
dried
any
particles
of
rust
can
be
removed
with
kerosene

removed
they
must
be
before

where
in
most
instances
the
hot

will
render
them
ineradicable
although
it
has

removing

the
removal
of

from

is
comparatively
easy
fruit
and
wine
stains
are
removed
by
stretching
the
fabric
over
a
bowl
and
pouring
boiling
water
through
the
stain
repeating
until
it
disappears
boiling
milk
is
sometimes
applied
successfully
to
wine
stains
in
the
same
way
a
thick
layer
of
salt
rubbed
into
the
stained
portion
and
followed
with
the
treatment
is
also
effective
obstinate
fruit
stains
yield
to
a
thorough
moistening
with
lemon
a
good
rubbing
with
salt
a
combination
which
is
to
be
found
all
prepared
at
the
drug
store
under
the
name
of
salts
of
lemon
and
the
application
of
boiling
water
when
nothing
else
avails
immerse
the
stained
portion
in
a
weak
solution
of
javelle
water
one
half
cup
to
one
pail
of
boiling
water
allow
it
to
soak
a
few
minutes
and
then
rinse
thoroughly
javelle
water
can
be
procured
of
the
druggist
but
is
as
well
prepared
at
home
by
dissolving
four
pounds
of
ordinary
washing
soda
in
one
gallon
of
water
boiling
ten
minutes
and
then
adding
to
it
one
pound
of
chloride
of
lime
it
should
be
kept
well
corked
and
resorted
to
in
extreme
cases
alone
as
it
is
violent
in
its
action
on
the
clothes
for
this
reason
special
care
must
be
given
to
rinsing
after
its
use
tea
and
coffee
stains
usually
surrender
to
boiling
water
but
if
they
prove
obdurate
rub
in
a
little
powdered
borax
and
pour
on
more
boiling
water
chocolate
stains
can
be
removed
in
the
same
way
sprinkling
the
stain
with
borax
and
soaking
first
in
cold
water
facilitates
the
action
of
the
boiling
water
rub
iron
rust
with
lemon
and
salt
and
lay
in
the

repeating
until
the

disappears
this
is
usually
all
that
is
necessary
but
if
the
stain
is
very
stubborn
spread
over
a
bowl
containing
one
quart
of
water
and
one
teaspoonful
of
borax
apply
hydrochloric
acid

of
the

prefers
to

overnight
if
so
dampen

well
particularly
the

roll
up

pack
in
the

of

pour
over
tepid
water
and
leave
till
morning
only
the
bed
and
body
linen
need
be
subjected
to
this
treatment
as
the
table
linen
is
rarely
sufficiently
soiled
to
require
it
and
the
colored
clothes
and
the
stockings
must
never
under
any
circumstances
be
allowed
to
stay
in
water
beyond
the
time
necessary
to
wash
and
rinse
them
the
water
if
only
hard
water
be
obtainable
may
be
softened
by
the
addition
of
a
little
ammonia

has
been
discolored

after
heavy
rains
or
by
the
repairing
of
water
pipes
should
be
strained
through
canton
flannel
before

after
soaking
the
linen
should
be
put
through
the
wringer
which
will
take
away
much
of
the
soil
with
the
water
and
then
washed
as
to
the
way
in
which
this
should
be
done
there
are
various
opinions
most
methods
in
use
by
experienced
laundresses
being
reliable
each
however
usually
has
her
favorite
method
of
procedure
which
it
is
perhaps
as
well
to
allow
her
to
follow
pity
is
is
true
that
many
housekeepers
are
so
ignorant
of
how
the
programme
should
really
be
conducted
that
they
are
incapable
of
directing
the
incompetent
laundress
the
mistress
of
the
house
needs
also
to
be
mistress
of
the
laundry
guiding
operations
there
as
elsewhere
seeing
to
it
that
body
and
table
linens
are
not
washed
together

the

it
must
be
in
either
the
soaking

or
the

and
sparingly
indeed
the
use
of
bleaches
at
any
time
is
a
custom
more
honored
in
the
breach
than
the
observance
though
there
is
no
rule
as
to
the
order
of
precedence
it
is
well
to
wash
the
woolens
first
after
shaking
them
free
from
lint
and
dust
prepare
two
tubs
of
lukewarm
suds
the
second
very
light
adding
a
little
borax
dissolved
in
boiling
water
to
each
never
apply
soap
directly
to
the
flannel
nor
rub
on
a
board
which
mats
the
wool
but
rub
with
the
hands
squeezing
and
dipping
up
and
down
in
the
first
water
till
clean
rinse
in
the

woolens
must
never
hang
in

them
to
shrink
and
harden
when
nearly

the

may
be
used
for
the
first
cotton
wash
if
both
colored

white
flannels
are
to
be
washed
the
former
should
be
done
first
thus
avoiding
the
lint
washed
from
the
latter
drying
can
be
accelerated
by
pressing
repeatedly
between
soft
cloths
if
the
ordinary

fails
to

there
is
no
royal
road
to

with
perseverance
and
care
the

laundress
can
become
quite

though

can
not
hope
to
compete
with
the
work
turned
out
by
those
who
do

iron

many
housewives
have
a
theory
that
unironed
sheets
are
the
more
hygienic
that
ironing
destroys
the
life
and
freshness
imparted
by
the
sun
and
air
such
being
the
case
the
sheets
can
be
evenly
and
carefully
folded

with

and
strong
pressure
on
the

lengthwise

be
injured
the
home
laundress
is
usually
not
quite
equal
to
the
task
of
ironing
shirts
which
would
far
better
go
to
the
laundry
but
when
done
at
home
from
choice
or
necessity
plenty
of
patience
and
muscle
must
be
applied
iron
the
body
of
the
shirt
first
then
draw
the
bosom
tightly
over
a
board
and
attack
it
with
the
regular
irons
wipe
over
quickly
with
a
damp
cloth
and
press
hard
with
the
polishing
iron
the
ironing
of
very
stiffly
starched
articles
may
be
facilitated
by
covering
with
cheesecloth
and
pressing
until
partially
dry
then
remove
the
cloth
and
iron
dry
as
each
piece
is
ironed
hang
on
bars
or
line
until
thoroughly
dried
and
aired
a
certain
amount
of
moisture
remains
even
after
the
ironing
and
must
be
entirely
removed
before
the
final
sorting
and
folding
and
putting
away
and
so
the
drama
comes
to
an
end
we
survey
with
pride
and
complaisance
the
piles
of
clean
linen
shining
with
spotless
elegance
and
as
we
read
therein
a
whole
sermon
on
the
gospel
of
cleanliness
we
conclude
that
it
is
decidedly
worth
while
and
rejoice
that
times
a
year
this
is
a
world

the
mistress
no
doubt
has
a
housewifely
taste
for
receipts
and
may
perhaps
find
the
following
formula
of
service
to
her
in
her
cheer
one
set
of
fine
spotless
table
linen
sprinkled
not
too
thickly
with
pretty
glass
china
and
silver
and
well
lightened
with
brightness
tempered
to
the
right
consistency
not
to
dazzle
to
this
add
a
few
sunny
faces
some
good
conversation
spiced
with
gayety
the
unpalatable
distasteful
portions
having
been
previously
eliminated
then
quietly
and
by
degrees
add
food
which
has
been
carefully
and
daintily
prepared
and
arranged
over
all
scatter
little
flecks
of
kindliness
and
courtesy
till
an
inward
glow
is
produced
and
keep
at
this
point
from
half
an
hour
to
an
hour
or
longer
this
receipt
may
be
depended
upon
to
give
satisfaction
under

and
all
conditions

compounded
of
ingredients
which
exemplary
home
makers
have
always
at

conscientiously
followed
failure
is
impossible
its
use
is
a
good
habit
stocking
the
china
cupboard
of
its
component
parts
the
more
substantial
ones
are
perhaps
the
most
easily
acquired
not
in
fashion
but
with
a
view
to
carrying
out
some
definite
idea
of
table
adornment
which
is
quite
the
most
charming
part
of
the
home
building
dishes
are
more
or
less
mixed
up
with
poesy
which
is
full
of
flowing
bowls
enchanted
cups
dishes
for
the
gods
flagons
of
ale
and
other
appetizing
suggestions
and
it
would
be
rather
a
good
thing
to
keep
the
poetry
in
mind
during
the
fitting
out
that
there
may
be
nothing
aggressively
cheap
nor
loudly
assertive
but
each
piece
harmoniously
congenial
to
its
fellows
there
need
be
no
hurry
that
is
one
of
the
delights
o
it

the

may

with

as

it
is
a
rare
experience
this

likely
to
be

experience
thanks
be
the
groundwork
there
is
so
much
exquisitely
patterned
and
inexpensive
china
glass
and
porcelain
turned
out
these

that

can
not

their

complete

are
giving
way
to
the
character
and
diversity
imparted
to
the
table
by
odd
pieces
and

for
different
courses
however
a
pretty
inexpensive
set
of
porcelain
or
china
something
which
will
bear
acquaintance
and
of
some
easily
replaced
standard
pattern
is
a
good
beginning
for
one
rarely
starts
out
with
a
full
equipment
of
fine
china
and
even
so
there
should
be
something
stronger
to
bear
the
heaviest
brunt
of
wear
all
complete

contain
one
hundred
and
seven
pieces
and
include
one
dozen
each
of

extra
the
choice
in
everyday
sets
lies
between
plain
white
preferably
the
french
china
known
as
haviland
which
can
be
bought
for
and
the
english
porcelain
of
different
makes
copeland
trenton
a
desirable
set
of
which
costs
and
higher
is
entirely
blameless
from
the
standpoint
of
good
taste
and
has
a
dainty
fineness
in
the
haviland
of
which
one
rarely
tires
while
it
never
clashes
with
anything
else
on
the
table
it
is
so
infinitely
preferable
to
cheap
gaudy
decorations
so
sincerely
and
honestly
what
it
seems
to
be
that
it
has
a
certain
quality
which
one
can
not
help
but
admire
has
an
attraction
which
has
never
died
since
it
had
its
birth
in
the
original
delft
which
is
copied
so
extensively
now
in
japan
and
china
and
though
the
porcelain
is
but
an
imitation
it
is
a
clever
one
and
one
which
leaves
little
to
be
desired
in
decorative
value
and
general
effect
the
design
may
strike
one
at
first
as
being
a
little
heavy
but
it
improves
on
acquaintance
and
it
has
been
very
aptly
said
that
the
fact
of
its
having
survived
enthusiasm
should
vouch
for
its
worth
porcelain
has
a
good
glaze
which
does
not
readily
crack
or
break
advancing
in
the
scale
of
cost
and
fineness
we
come
to
that
most
beautiful
of
all
chinas
the
which
can
be
had
at
from
a
set
up
to
as
high
as
the
gilding
is
in
coin
gold
the
effect
of
richness
tempered
with
chastity
being
carried
through
all
grades
in
varying
intensity
it
expresses
itself
beyond
expression
and
is
an
honor
to
any
table
course
sets
when
it
comes
to
the
purchase
of
course
sets
different
tastes
can
find
instant
gratification
in
numberless
colorings
and
designs
overdecoration
and
large
floral
devices
must
be
avoided
but
any
delicately
expressed
pattern
is
good
and
here
again
the
seems
to
fulfill
all
demands
soup
salad
tea
butter
and
other
plates
can
be
had
in
china
from
cents
apiece
up
articles
of
this
kind
in
a
standard
pattern
may
be
bought
one
or
two
at
a
time
and
added
to
as
ability
permits
until
the
set
is
completed
any
unusual
design
runs
through
two
years
after
which
it
can
be
obtained
only
from
the
factory
a
dozen
of
each
is
a
good
number
to
aim
at
for
there
will
be
many
occasions
which
will
call
out
one
whole
dish
brigade
and
keep
it
actively
engaged
the
old
joke
about
having
to
wash
dishes
between
courses
and
sending
the
ice
cream
afloat
on
a
warm
plate
really
loses
its
amusing
aspect
when
it
becomes
an
actual
experience
unless
the
mistress
prefers
to
serve
her
soup
at
the
table
a
tureen
is
not
a
necessity
but
if
used
it
must
match
the
soup
plates
it
is
a
somewhat
fluctuating
fashion
out
at
present
soup
plates
are
not
the
great
flaring
affairs
of
yore
they
either
follow
the
old
shape
much
reduced
or
are
in
the
nature
of
a
large
sauce
dish
the
meat
set
of
platters
plates
and
vegetable
dishes

into
play
at
all

put
to

all

on

such
a
way
that
the

is
seemingly
a

matter

the
trick
of
good

and
a
mathematical
eye
are
both
involved
in

the
manner
of
setting
and
serving
the
table
varies
somewhat
with
each
meal
but
a
few
suggestions
apply
to
all
alike
the
center
of
the
table
must
be
exactly
under
the
chandelier
and
covered
with
the
pretty
centerpiece
with
its
dish
of
ferns
a
vase
of
posies
or
a
potted
plant
in
a
white
crinkled
pinafore
nothing
else
has
the
decorative
value
of
the
table
posy
however
simple
which
seems
to
breathe
out
some
of
its
outdoor
life
and
freshness
and
should
never
be
omitted
twenty
inches
must
be
allowed
for
each
cover
or
place
to
give
elbow
room
and
all
that
belongs
to
it
should
be
accurately
and
evenly
placed
at
the
right
go
the
knives
sharp
edges
in
and
spoons
with
open
bowls
up
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
to
be
used
beginning
at
the
right
at
the
points
of
the
knives
stands
the
water
glass
at
the
left
are
arranged
the
forks
tines
up
also
in
the
order
of
use
beginning
at
the
left
with
the
butter
plate
on
which
rests
the
butter
knife
a
little
above
the
forks
the
napkin
which
should
be
folded
four
times
in
ironing
and
never
tortured
into
fantastic
shapes
restaurant
fashion
lies
either
at
the
left
of
the
forks
or
on
the
plate
at
the
center
of
the
cover
if
many
spoons
are
to
be
used
the
soup
spoon
alone
rests
beside
the
knife
with
the
others
above
the
plate
individual
salt
cellars
go
above
the
plates
shakers
at
the
sides
or
corners
of
the
table
within
easy
reach
and
one
carafe
is
usually
allowed
for
every
three

are
laid

just
before
the

for

the

of

on
taking

on
her

and
placing

if
it
be

are
taken
up
from
the

with
a

knife
or

never
with
a

many
housekeepers
prefer
to
dismiss
the
maid
after
the
main
part
of
the
meal
is
served
ringing
for
her
when
her
services
are
necessary
thus
insuring
a
greater
privacy
during
the
charmed
hour
and
affording
an
opportunity
for
those
little
thoughtful
attentions
when
each
serves
his
neighbor
as
himself
the
breakfast
table
the
breakfast
table
is
usually
laid
with
centerpiece
and
plate
doilies
these
days
and
it
may
not
be
to
suggest
that
every
effort
be
made
to
have
this
meal
cheery
and
attractive
for
it
is
alas
too
often
suggestive
of
funeral
baked
meats
and
megrims
from
the
night
before
if
fruit
is
to
be
served
followed
by
a
cereal
and

luncheon
luncheon
is
the
simplest
daintiest
most
informal
meal
of
the
day
just
a
little
halting
place
between
breakfast
and
dinner
where
one
pretty
china
comes
out
strongly
the
setting
of
the
table
follows
the
usual
arrangement
everything
necessary
for

is
placed
at
the
head
of
the

with
the
meat
or
other
substantial
dish
at
the
opposite
end
most
of
the
food
is
placed
on
the
table
before
the
meal
is
announced
and
as
there
are
usually
but
two
courses
the
plates
are
changed
only
once
the
only
difference
between
luncheon
and

being
the
hour
of

is
frequently
omitted
from
this

an
oblong

of

a

being
placed

if

is
to
be

the

is
placed
at
the
right
of

there
is
a
preference
for
the
use
of
a
service
plate
at
this
meal
the
plate
which
is
at
each
place
when
dinner
is
announced
and
is
not
removed
until
the
first
hot
course
after
the
soup
but
this
is
usually
dispensed
with
when
there
is

its
place
before

the
formal

the
formal

follows
the
general
idea
and
arrangement
of
the
family
dinner
with
considerable
elaboration
out
come
our
table
linen
china
glass
and
silver
and
we
add
certain
festive
touches
in
the
way
of
vines
and
cut
flowers
loosely
and
gracefully
disposed
in
glass
or
silver
bowls
and
vases
at
the

a
witching
glamour
over
the

yellow

cool
in

genial
lace
and

have
been
banished
from
the

as
being
inconsistent
with
simplicity
but
a
small
bunch
of
flowers
or
a
single
flower
at
each
place
gives
a
pretty
touch
the

is
moved
over
to

placed
at

of
the

the

overmuch

savors
of
ostentation
therefore
if

are
to
be

the

may
go
above

chapter
ix
the
bedroom
the
bedroom
is
very
like
an
old
familiar
friend
it
sees
us
as
we
really
are
tempting
us
to
throw
off
all
veneer
of
pretense
or
worldliness
and
rest
in
just
being
ourselves
a
rest
so
sweet
and
wholesome
and
good
that
we
go
from
it
recreated
and
strengthened
in
the
spirit
of
truest
friendship
it
exacts
nothing
but
by
its
subtle
quiet
sympathy
charms
away
our
restlessness
and
presents
us
anew
to
that
person
known
as
our
better
self
the
friend
of
our
choice
is
the
one
who
wears
well
who
never
intrudes
never
wearies
never
pains
us
whose
influence
is
one
of
rest
of
restoration
of
reinspiration
the
embodiment
of
the
true
mission
of
the
bedroom
it
like
our
friend
must
be
able
to
survive
with
honor
the
test
of
that
familiarity
which
comes
with
intimacy
whether
it
shall
breed
contempt
or
content
and
so
as
we
plan
it
let
us
endeavor
to
temper
our
likes
and
dislikes
with
judgment
until
we
can
be
reasonably
sure
that
it
will
be
a
room
pleasant
to
live
with
and
companionable
which
will
not
irritate
our
moods
into
becoming
moodier
nor
our
weariness
into
becoming
wearier
light
and
air
of
first
importance
of
course
are
light
and
air
these
we
must
have
and
sun
if
possible
one
good
warm
ray
of
sunshine
is
a
more
effective
destroyer
of
disease
and
dumps
than
all
the
drugs
on
the
market
while
good
ventilation
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
as
well
as
one
of
the
cheapest
and
most
ignored
assets
of
the
home
particularly
of
the
bedroom
where
our
hereditary
enemy
the
microbe
loves
especially
to
linger
given
air
and
light
we
have
the
best
possible
start
toward
our
rest
room
and
upon
its
exposure
and
size
depends
largely
what
we
shall
add
unto
it
in
the
way
of
furnishings
and
decorations
dark
walls
and
floors
wrap
one
in
gloom
and
have
no
place
in
any
bedroom
a
warm
sunny
exposure
invites
the
use
of
contrastingly
cool
light
blues
grays
greens
and
creams
while
the
glow
of
delicate
pinks
and
yellows
helps
to
make
a
sunshine
in
the
shadows
of
a
north
light
east
and
west
lights
adapt
themselves
to
the
tasteful
use
of
almost
any
color
saving
and
excepting
red
which
can
not
be
mentioned
in
the
same
breath
with
rest
and
has
the
effect
on
nerves
if
an
overstrong
affection
for
it
demands
its
use
it
must
be
indulged
in
sparingly
and
much
scattered
and
tempered
with
white
though
a
certain
sympathetic
warmth
should
be
expressed
in
the
bedroom
coloring
we
want
rather
to
feel
than
to
see
it
and
too
much
becomes
a
weariness
carpets
versus
rugs
beginning
with
the
base
as
becomes
a
good
builder
and
working
upward
floor
coverings
which
cover
without
covering
if
one
may
indulge
in
an
irishism
are
far
preferable
to
those
which
extend
from
wall
to
wall
carpets
undoubtedly
have
their
uses
they
make
over
well
into
rugs
supply
heat
to
the
feet
particularly
in
summer
and
to
the
disposition
during
the
semiannual
house
cleaning
they
also
cover
a
multitude
of
moths
but
they
belong
to
the
dark
ages
of
unenlightened
womanhood
whose
chief
end
was
to
keep
house
and
have
been
jostled
into
the
background
by
bare
floors
or
mattings
with
rugs
hardwood
floors
certainly
are
nice
and
seem
to
wear
an
air
of
conscious
pride
of
birth
but
their
humbler
brethren
of
common
pine
stained
and
varnished
or
oiled
answer
the
purpose
fully
as
well
it
really
amounts
to
a
case
of
rugs
make
the
floor
for
if
they
are
pretty
and
conveniently
disposed
about
it
the
floor
itself
receives
very
little
attention
small
rugs
before
bed
dresser
and
chiffonier
will
suffice
in
a
small
room
and
can
be
easily
taken
out
and
cleaned
but
a
more
commodious
room
requires
the
dressed
look
imparted
by
the
larger
rug
whatever
its
size
avoid
large
figures
and
strong
colors
choosing
rather
a
small
somewhat
indistinct
pattern
woven
in
the
deeper
shades
of
the
other
decorations
of
the
room
at
the
same
time
supplying
a
foundation
which
without
calling
attention
to
itself
becomes
a
good
support
for
the
general
decorative
plan
a
base
strong
but
neither
heavy
nor
striking
since
we
were
made
to
stand
erect
and
look
up
it
is
irritating
to
have
one
eyes
drawn
downward
by
the
unattractive
attraction
of
an
ugly
rug
the
colonial
cotton
rag
rugs
are
quite
the
most
desirable
for
bedroom
use
from
a
sanitary
as
well
as
an
artistic
standpoint
and
are
woven
to
produce
charming
effects
the
usual
combination
is
two
colors
white
with
blue
yellow
green
or
pink
black
with
red
different
shades
of
the
same
color
etc
occasionally
three
colors
are
used
but
more
are
apt
to
destroy
the
dainty
simplicity
which
is
the
chief
charm
of
rugs
of
this
kind
they
are
woven
like
any
other
rag
rug
and
of
any
dimensions
mattings
mattings
if
preferred
to
the
bare
floor
come
in
a
variety
of
patterns
and
colors
and
look
neat
and
fresh
and
cool
in
summer
if
used
without
rugs
they
are
a
yard
wide
and
range
in
price
from
to
cents
a
yard
for
the
chinese
and
from
to
cents
for
the
japanese
there
is
very
little
choice
between
the
two
though
the
chinese
wears
a
little
better
perhaps
matting
is
easily
broken
and
should
not
be
used
where
the
bed
must
be
drawn
away
from
the
wall
to
be
made
or
heavy
furniture
moved
about
wall
covering
passing
from
floor
to
walls
we
reach
that
portion
of
the
room
which
gives
it
its
real
atmosphere
and
supplies
a
background
for
all
that
it
contains
of
both
things
and
people
the
bedroom
seems
to
be
preeminently
a
woman
room
here
she
reads
and
writes
rests
and
sews
it
is
her
help
in
trouble
her
refuge
in
times
of
storm
the
intangible
something
which
surrounds
the
eternal
feminine
clings
about
her
room
and
tells
a
very
truthful
tale
of
the
individuality
of
its
occupant
her
favorite
color
peeps
out
from
wall
and
drapery
her
books
and
hearing
evidences
of
intimate
association
lie
cozily
about
and
her
workbasket
reveals
the
source
of
certain
dainty
covers
and
indescribable
nothings
which
so
materially
refine
the
whole
aspect
of
the
room
though
she
receives
her
formal
calls
in
the
it
is
in
her
bedroom
that
those
confidential
chats
so
dear
to
the
feminine
heart
take
place
therefore
its
background
must
be
chosen
with
some
idea
of
its
becomingness
and
the
happy
medium
in
color
and
tint
selected
softening
and
becoming
to
all
alike
as
absence
of
manners
is
good
manners
so
absence
of
effect
is
after
all
the
best
effect
first
and
foremost
avoid
the
plague
of
white
walls
and
ceilings
which
cast
a
ghastly
light
over
the
whole
room
and
make
one
fairly
shiver
with
cold
the
general
plan
is
to
shade
the
color
up
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
this
is
accomplished
in
so
many
differing
and
equally
attractive
ways
that
it
is
impossible
to
do
more
than
offer
suggestions
which
may
be
elaborated
to
suit
individual
tastes
and
conditions
of
course
calcimine
is
the
simplest
and
cheapest
style
of
decoration
and
recommends
itself
to
the
disciple
because
it
can
be
renewed
annually
at
slight
expense
the
only
difficulty
lies
in
getting
just
the
right
tint
for
decorators
though
no
doubt
worthy
of
their
hire
are
not
always
capable
of
handling
the
artistic
side
of
their
business
and
an
uncongenial
shade
gets
on
the
nerves
after
a
while
the
same
thing
holds
true
of
painted
walls
and
ceilings
though
they
too
are
hygienically
good
when
we
come
to
papers
we
are
lost
in
a
maze
of
stripes
and
garlands
and
nosegays
either
alone
or
in
combination
prettiness
is
by
no
means
synonymous
with
expense
these
days
when
the
general
patterns
and
colors
of
costly
papers
are
successfully
reproduced
in
the
cheaper
grades
tapestry
papers
are
too
heavy
for
bedrooms
those
figured
with
that
mathematical
precision
which
drives
the
beholder
to
counting
and
thence
to
incipient
insanity
and
others
on
which
we
fancy
we
can
trace
the
features
of
our
friends
are
always
distracting
especially
during
illness
when
restfulness
is
so
essential
the
plain
wall
with
frieze
and
ceiling
either
flowered
or
of
a
light
shade
of
the
same
or
a
contrasting
color
is
never
obtrusive
and
always
in
good
taste
with
a
flowered
wall
a
plain
ceiling
is
a
relief
and
vice
versa
figures
in
both
walls
and
ceiling
are
tiring
besides
having
none
of
the
effect
resulting
from
contrast
walls
in
plain
stripes
need
to
be
livened
with
a
fancy
ceiling
or
ceiling
and
frieze
with
their
background
always
of
the
lightest
tint
in
the
side
wall
one
room
of
particular
charm
was
all
in
yellow
the
molding
had
been
dropped
three
feet
from
the
ceiling
giving
the
impression
of
a
low
ceiling
and
that
snugness
which
goes
with
it
and
up
to
it
ran
the
paper
while
over
frieze
and
ceiling
ran
a
riot
of
yellow
roses
and
here
was
asserted
the
ingenuity
of
its
occupant
who
had
cut
out
some
of
the
roses
and
draped
them
at
the
corners
and
by
door
and
window
casings
where
they
seemed
to
cling
after
being
spilled
from
the

above
this
same
idea
can
be
worked
out
with
garlands
or
bunches
of
different
flowers

knots
or

distinct
designs
no
large
figures
of
any
description
should
be
introduced
into
a
small
room
and
the
whole
effect
of
the
decoration
must
be
cheerful
without
being

more
how
stereotyped
and
assertive
they
were
and
undecorative
bed
dresser
and
washstand
forcibly
recalling
to
one
the
big
bear
bear
and
little
bear
of
nursery
lore
were
clumsy
and
heavy
and
bad
even
in
hardwood
but
when
they
were
simply
stained
imitations
of
the
real
thing
and
ornate
with
wooden
knobs
machine
carving
and
ungraceful
lines
they
were
truly
unspeakable
the
bed
with
its
fat
bolster
on
top
of
which
like
ossa
on
pelion
piled
stood
the
pillows
perhaps
covered
with
shams
which
bade
one
good
night
and
good
morning
in
red
cotton
embroidery
was
especially
hideous
as
contrasted
with
our
enameled
or
brass
bed
and
belongs
to
the
dark
ages
of
crocheted
tidies
photograph
albums
whatnots
prickly
slippery
haircloth
furniture
and
other
household
idols
which
bring
thoughts
that
lie
too
deep
for
tears
only
two
styles
of
sets
find
a
welcome
in
the
home
the
rich
dark
mellow
mahogany
which
is
too
costly
for
the
average
pocketbook
and
the
white
enameled
even
so
the
component
parts
differ
from
those
of
a
few
years
back
then
the
dresser
was
considered
an
absolute
essential
now
we
frequently
prefer
the
more
graceful
dressing
table
with
its
small
drawer
or
two
for
the
unornamental
toilet
accessories
or
the
compromise
between
the
two
the
princess
dresser
with
the
roomy
chest
of
drawers
or
chiffonier
the
furniture
gives
the
room
an
air
of
chaste
purity
and
is
no
more
expensive
than
a
set
in
any
other
good
wood
but
must
be
well
enameled
or
it
will
be
impossible
to
keep
it
clean
careful
selection
the
trend
of
popular
sentiment
is
toward
the
metal
bed
with
accompanying
furniture
in
plain
or
maple
mahogany
dark
oak
curly
birch
or
dressers
range
in
price
from
to
princess
dressers
from
to
chiffoniers
from
to
and
dressing
tables
from
to
furniture
like
friends
can
not
be
acquired
promiscuously
without
unpleasant
consequences
there
is
no
economy
in
buying
cheap
veneered
pieces
which
will
be
or
ought
to
be
always
an
eyesore
the
truly
thrifty
homemaker
will
wait
until
she
can
afford
to
buy
something
genuinely
good
and
then
buy
it
with
the
conviction
that
she
is
laying
up
treasures
of
future
happiness
and
contentment
the
good
piece
is
exactly
what
it
claims
to
be
without
pretense
or
artificiality
of
hardwood
of
course
of
simple
construction
and
graceful
artistic
lines
its
few
decorations
carved
not
glued
on
toilet
and
dressing
tables
simplicity
must
be
the
keynote
of
all
bedroom
furnishings
the
middle
course
in
price
is
the
safe
one
to
follow
leaning
toward
the
greater
rather
than
toward
the
lesser
cost
if
there
is
a
bathroom
conveniently
near
it
is
better
to
dispense
with
a
washstand
but
if
its
use
is
imperative
make
it
as
little
obtrusive
as
possible
the
home
carpenter
can
easily
fashion
one
from
a
plain
pine
table
hung
with
a
valance
to
match
the
other
draperies
if
a
table
is
available
so
much
the
better
toilet
sets
can
be
purchased
for
and
up
and
should
be
of
simple
design
and
decoration
plain
white
or
being
advisable
for
general
use
as
neither
will
clash
with
anything
else
in
the
room
a
very
satisfactory
set
in
the
is
to
be
had
for
a
dainty
dressing
table
follows
the
idea
of
a
makeshift
washstand
it
should
be
made
of
a
sizeable
drygoods
box
with
shelves
and
the
top
padded
and
covered
to
match
the
drapery
the
mirror
which
hangs
over
it
may
be
draped
or
simply
framed
in
white
enamel
gold
or
whatever
blends
with
the
room
overdraping
not
only
looks
fussy
but
means
additional
bother
and
care
the
drapery
is
thrown
over
a
frame
fastened
above
the
mirror
further
comforts
in
addition
to
what
is
considered
the
regulation
bedroom
furniture
there
should
be
a
small
table
at
the
head
of
the
bed
for
the
glass
of
water
the
candle
or
night
lamp
and
books
of
devotion
a
couch
for
the
mistress

and
to
save
the
immaculateness
of
the

a
comfortable
rocker
with
a
low
sewing
chair
and
one
or
two
with
straight
backs
and
when
two
people
occupy
the
room
a
screen
which
insures
some
degree
of
privacy
and
affords
a
protection
from

if

a

if
in

a

be
used

of
severe

with
backs
and
seats
covered
with

the

a

sum
but
here
again
it
is
well
not
to
count
the
cost
too
closely
for
the
return
in
comfort
and
refreshment
can
not
be
estimated
in
dollars
and

the
change
from
wooden
to
metal
beds
is
desirable
in
every
way
besides
being
so
much
more
hygienic
they
seem
to
take
up
less

admit
of
a
freer
circulation
of

they
can
be
painted
over
and
freshened
up
when
necessary
and
look
well
with
any

the
best

are
formed
by
parallel
bars

those
with
simple

at

unless
through
the

of

the

of

produces
the

surely
no

has
a

it
interferes
to
a

with
the

and
affords
a

for

it

to

his

his

is
a

one
to

no

they

we

more
than
just
answering
care
of
bedroom
and

much
of
the
refinement
of
the
bedroom
depends
upon
its
daily
care
this
begins
with
its
airing
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
the
bed
is
stripped
of
its
coverings
which
are
spread
over
two
chairs
placed
before
the
open
window
the
mattress
is
half
turned
over
and
night
clothes
and
pillows
are
placed
near
the
window
the
slops
are
then
emptied
bowl
and
all
toilet
articles
washed
in
hot
water
and
dried
pitcher
emptied
and
refilled
with
fresh
water
and
soiled
towels
replaced
by
clean
ones
soiled
towels
must
never
be
used
to
clean
the
crockery
cleaning
cloths
for
bedroom
use
should
be
kept
for
that
purpose
alone
once
a
week
slop
receptacles
must
be
scalded
with
sal
soda
water
and
stood
in
the
sun
after
an
hour
the
windows
may
be
closed
and
the
bed
made
the
first
thing
is
to
turn
the
mattress
end
for
end
one
day
side
for
side
the
next
and
then
comes
the
pad
and
after
it
the
sheets
the
lower
one
is
put
on
right
side
up
drawn
tight
and
tucked
in
smoothly
all
around
the
upper
should
be
wrong
side
up
drawn
well
up
to
the
head
and
tucked
in
at
the
bottom
and
the
blankets
brought
up
to
within
half
a
yard
of
the
head
with
the
open
end
at
the
top
when
all
is
straight
and
even
the
upper
sheet
is
turned
back
smoothly
over
the
blankets
and
both
are
tucked
snugly
in
the
counterpane
which
was
folded
and
laid
aside
during
the
night
then
goes
on
and
is
brought
down
evenly
over
the
foot
and
sides
of
the
bed
the
bedroll
or
day
pillows
are
added
and
the
bed
is
itself
again
on
saturday
the
bottom
sheet
is
replaced
by
the
top
sheet
which
in
turn
is
replaced
by
a
clean
one
and
the
pillowcases
are
changed
the
spread
usually
needs
changing
about
once
a
month
the
night
pillows
are
now
beaten
and
put
away
and
night
clothes
are
hung
in
the
closet
other
articles
are
put
in
their
places
the
dresser
top
is
brushed
off
and
its
various
contents
properly
arranged
litter
is
taken
up
with
dustpan
and
brush
or
and
the
room
is
dusted
opened
windows

even
the

is
not

against

are
rather
inhospitable

there
is

chapter
x
the
bathroom
with
the
subject
of
the
bathroom
before
us
it
would
seem
to
be
in
order
to
promulgate
the
only
really
true
theory
of
bathing
but
this
is
not
a
treatise
upon
hygiene
and
the
world
already
has
been
flooded
with
advice
on
this
subject
ranging
from
the
urgings
of
those
amphibiously
inclined
folk
who
would
each
day
run
the
whole
gamut
of
splash
souse
and
scrub
to
the
theories
of
the
dauntless
chicago
doctor
who
would
put
all
humanity
on
a
level
by
abolishing
bathing
altogether
so
we
shall
merely
discuss
the
means
of
making
the
bathroom
attractive
and
serviceable
trusting
to
our
individual
good
sense
for
its
proper
use
everyone
has
heard
of
the
good
woman
who
was
showing
some
friends
about
her
new
home
the
bathtub
was
an
object
of
special
pride
why
she
exclaimed
in
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
it
so
nice
that
we
can
scarcely
wait
till
saturday
night
we
may
laugh
at
her
naïveté
but
there
is
a
good
deal
more
of
the
waiting
for
saturday
night
proposition
than
is
good
for
some
of
our
neighbors
and
on
the
other
hand
there
is
more
of
the
heroic
sort
of
bathing
by
faithful
devotees
of
cleanliness
than
is
necessary
the
persistent
spirit
will
have
his
bath
if
it
has
to
be
with
bowl
and
sponge
in
a
cold
room
but
while
most
persons
are
persistently
cleanly
bathing
in
the
interest
of
healthfulness
should
be
regular
and
it
should
be
enjoyable
and
it
can
not
be
either
unless
the
bathroom
is
properly
equipped
and
is
ready
for
service
when
wanted
even
at
some
extra
cost
it
should
be
made
possible
to
secure
hot
water
promptly
and
without
agitating
the
whole
household
at
any
reasonable
hour
of
any
day
of
the
week
no
family
that
we
ever
knew
went
bankrupt
on
account
of
the
cost
of
hot
water
for
bathing
and
if
they
did
they
would
have
a
pretty
valid
excuse
plumbing
the
bathroom
is
the
heart
of
the
plumbing
problem
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
declare
that
the
plumbing
is
the
most
important
feature
of
the
house
so
far
as
health
is
concerned
did
we
examine
an
old
house
one
of
even
ten
years
ago
with
a
view
to
purchasing
or
renting
the
condition
of
the
plumbing
would
be
a
first
consideration
if
it
were
not
safe
and
in
good
order
we
should
have
to
make
it
so
for
of
course
no
one
who
is
mentally
competent
would
take
any
chances
on
such
a
menace
to
the
family
welfare
and
to
repair
antiquated
plumbing
is
an
ungrateful
task
while
to
replace
it
entirely
requires
both
courage
and
a
willingness
to
let
go
of
one
money
in
large
wads
now
we
want
to
remember
that
we
shall
wish
to
have
our
plumbing
satisfactory
not
only
when
the
house
is
new
but
ten
years
later
when
it
is
not
new
to
make
sure
of
this
we
need
first
of
all
to
know
something
of
modern
methods
and
equipment
then
we
should
employ
a
capable
plumber
though
he
may
cost
us
more
than
the
merely
passable
sort
finally
we
should
supplement
good
workmanship
with
the
best
materials
it
may
be
noted
that
after
the
supply
houses
have
evolved
the
best
materials
in
the
sense
that
the
materials
are
convenient
good
to
look
at
and
perfectly
sanitary
they
add
frills
and
decorations
that
bring
up
the
cost
to
any
amount
we
insist
upon
spending
but
we
can
get
what
we
really
require
without
paying
for
the
frills
if
we
exhibit
tolerable
ability
in
the
selection
of
essentials
open
plumbing
is
of
course
the
only
sort
that
any
plumber
of
these
days
would
consent
to
put
in
if
he
hints
at
anything
else
we
may
well
be
suspicious
of
him
not
only
should
the
plumbing
be
where
we
can
see
and
get
at
it
but
sinks
lavatories
and
tubs
should
have
no
inclosures
that
may
retain
filth
or
become
sewer
gas
is
not
the
only
evil
to
be
guarded
against
but
it
is
the
greatest
it
is
also
the
subtlest
for
in
some
of
its
most
deadly
forms
it
is
inodorous
and
usually
does
its
work
before
we
become
conscious
of
its
existence
the
poisonous
gas
is
not
necessarily
generated
in
the
sewer
but
may
be
created
anywhere
in
the
pipes
that
obstructions
or
uneven
surfaces
permit
filth
to
accumulate
if
however
the
plumbing
is
modern
and
of
substantial
quality
to
begin
with
has
stood
all
the
tests
and
is
accessible
and
fairly
well
understood
by
at
least
one
member
of
the
household
reasonable
vigilance
will
obviate
practically
all
worry
about
sewer
gas
bathroom
location
and
furnishing
usually
the
bathroom
is
placed
in
a
central
location
on
the
second
floor
accessible
if
possible
by
both
rear
and
front
stairways
in
a
small
house
the
upper
floor
is
always
advisable
as
the
bathroom
should
be
well
retired
from
the
living
quarters
where
the
space
can
be
spared
there
should
be
a
closet
however
on
the
main
floor
or
at
least
in
the
basement
where
it
will
be
readily
accessible
from
the
back
part
of
the
house
if
the
bathtub
is
popular
with
the
household
it
is
in
constant
use
and
for
this
reason
the
closet
is
in
some
cases
cut
off
from
it
and
is
reached
by
a
separate
door
illustration
the
bathroom
the
principal
thought
being
to
eliminate
anything
which
will
retain
water
tile
or
rubber
flooring
is
preeminently
best
for
the
bathroom
if
wood
is
substituted
it
should
be
oak
or
maple
thoroughly
oiled
nothing
should
rest
upon
the
floor
to
prevent
any
portion
of
the
surface
from
being
thoroughly
cleaned
a
tile
wainscoting
is
almost
indispensable
paper
will
not
stand
steam
and
moisture
and
calcimine
is
scarcely
better
canvas
or
burlap
above
a
or
wainscoting
makes
an
attractive
combination
is
not
called
for
but
light
tints
of
green
buff
or
terra
cotta
will
give
a
softening
touch
of
color
without
destroying
the
general
effect
of
immaculateness
art
glass
in
the
window
can
scarcely
fail
to
add
to
the
attractiveness
of
the
room
it
may
be
had
for
from
cents
to
per
square
foot
a
rug
is
an
essential
but
it
should
be
of
a
sort
that
will
not
readily
absorb
and
retain
water
speaking
of
the
window
it
must
be
observed
that
outdoor
ventilation
without
disturbing
privacy
should
be
made
possible
often
a
bathroom
becomes
quite
suffocating
and
with
weakly
persons
the
danger
of
being
overcome
in
a
locked
room
is
not
to
be
left
out
of
consideration
the
tub
the
tub
may
be
of
enameled
iron
or
of
porcelain
the
former
costs
very
much
less
and
is
almost
as
satisfactory
as
the
latter
though
in
the
cheaper
sorts
at
least
the
enamel
will
eventually
crack
of
course
it
can
be
reenameled
but
in
most
things
for
the
home
there
will
be
enough
of
repairing
without
counting
too
much
upon
the
ease
with
which
it
may
be
done
that
which
will
go
longest
without
any
repairs
is
usually
best
still
as
between
the
two
kinds
of
tubs
one
can
scarcely
make
a
mistake
either
way
and
the
difference
in
price
will
govern
the
decision
of
most
of
us
to
be
consistent
in
our
thought
of
keeping
the
floor
clear
we
should
have
a
bathtub
that
rests
upon
legs
it
should
not
if
avoidable
be
placed
under
the
window
and
if
it
can
be
several
inches
from
the
wall
it
is
more
easily
cleaned
on
the
outside
and
the
space
next
to
the
wall
need
not
accumulate
or
at
least
retain
soap
towels
and
sponges
that
elude
the
grasp
of
the
bather
tubs
come
in
lengths
from
four
to
six
feet
and
cost
accordingly
the
comfort
of
a
bath
to
persons
of
any
considerable
elongation
is
always
manifest
while
a
tub
is
merely
better
than
a
footbath
where
hot
water
is
not
on
tap
in
unlimited
quantities
five
feet
is
a
fair
compromise
in
porcelain
enameled
ware
a
tub
of
this
size
costs
from
to
without
fittings
the
goods
included
in
this
range
are
warranted
not
to
crack
or
craze
porcelain
prices
are
almost
double
those
mentioned
if
we
want
stripings
or
pretty
flowers
or
highly
ornamented
legs
for
the
tub
we
will
be
permitted
to
pay
for
them
but
they
are
scarcely
requisites
in
the
bathroom
economy
waste
and
overflow
arrangements
for
the
tub
must
be
well
looked
after
when
the
master
of
the
household
is
likely
at
any
time
to
turn
on
the
water
for
a
dip
and
then
become
absorbed
in
studying
the
latest
automobile
catalogue
one
feels
safer
to
know
that
the
superfluous
water
will
find
a
ready
outlet
through
the
pipes
rather
than
the
floors
and
halls
the
same
precautions
are
to
be
observed
with
the
lavatory
where
young
america
may
choose
to
devote
himself
to
original
experiments
in
hydrostatics
instead
of
performing
the
simple
process
of
expeditiously
removing
the
grime
from
his
digits
the
lavatory
anything
that
is
all
of
one
piece
is
likely
to
prove
more
lasting
than
the
other
kinds
in
the
lavatory
there
are
various
combinations
some
of
them
including
handsome
marble
tops
but
basin
and
top
should
not
be
separate
if
the
wall
is
tile
the
back
that
fits
to
it
is
not
essential
but
if
the
back
is
used
it
should
be
of
a
piece
with
the
slab
bowl
and
apron
to
avoid
ugly
cracks
and
breakage
the
bracket
form
is
usually
regarded
as
most
convenient
as
legs
are
often
in
the
way
unobtrusive
looking
as
they
may
be
another
method
of
attachment
is
by
a
concealed
wall
hanger
the
pedestal
design
is
somewhat
more
artistic
but
additionally
expensive
not
only
in
the
beginning
but
afterward
in
the
event
of
damage
lavatories
in
enameled
iron
cost
from
to
including
fittings
and
pipes
above
floor
some
people
like
running
water
in
their
bedrooms
and
a
private
lavatory
is
certain
to
be
appreciated
by
visitors
objection
has
been
made
that
the
introduction
of
plumbing
into
the
bedroom
affords
a
new
source
of
poisoning
but
with
modern
materials
and
workmanship
this
need
not
be
feared
for
the
bedroom
the
supply
man
will
recommend
the
pedestal
arrangement
costing
about
but
less
expensive
forms
might
serve
of
course
every
additional
outlet
such
as
this
increases
the
piping
bill
and
outlay
for
labor
the
closet
so
far
as
the
health
of
the
family
is
concerned
the
most
important
feature
of
the
bathroom
is
the
closet
here
it
would
be
simply
folly
for
us
to
let
any
consideration
of
dollars
prompt
us
to
substitute
an
inferior
or
apparatus
for
the
safe
kind
it
would
be
better
to
sell
the
piano
or
even
to
steal
the
money
from
the
bank
the
only
safety
against
sewer
gas
in
the
closet
is
to
prevent
it
the
gas
from
entering
the
house
and
to
make
sure
that
gas
from
the
water
pipes
is
given
an
adequate
exit
and
compelled
to
make
use
of
it
the
washout
closet
was
a
pretty
good
assurance
that
the
one
gas
would
get
in
and
that
the
other
could
not
get
out
the
siphon
closet
of
recent
manufacture
seems
to
be
a
much
more
dependable
sort
of
contraption
though
we
need
not
accept
as
gospel
the
makers
assertion
that
it
is
perfection
the
most
reliable
way
to
shut
out
gas
is
with
water
even
in
the
old
closets
it
was
supposed
that
the
outlet
pipe
would
be
kept
covered
with
water
but
as
one
could
not
see
where
the
water
was
or
was
not
the
supposition
was
always
to
be
regarded
as
proper
material
for
an
affidavit
many
a
person
has
moped
around
and
growled
at
the
weather
or
the
cook
or
anything
he
could
think
of
to
blame
when
it
was
the
cheap
old
plumbing
arrangement
he
had
thought
of
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
misery
sometimes
too
we
think
a
little
sewer
gas
is
preferable
to
the
plumber
and
his
bill
but
that
is
a
very
silly
thought
indeed
the
siphon
closet
not
only
overflows
but
it
siphons
or
draws
out
the
contents
of
the
bowl
this
is
replaced
with
clear
water
which
completely
shuts
off
the
outlet
pipe
comparing
the
actions
of
the
two
systems
we
readily
see
the
better
cleansing
power
of
the
double
action
while
the
seal
on
the
vent
pipe
is
always
evident
a
good
siphon
closet
costs
from
to
and
unless
we
find
something
still
safer
we
would
better
choose
it
the
low
tank
is
preferable
in
many
ways
to
the
sort
that
is
attached
to
the
wall
near
the
ceiling
it
is
more
compact
can
be
installed
under
windows
or
stairways
and
looks
better
besides
it
is
not
so
noisy
and
operates
with
greater
ease
with
either
chain
or
push
button
the
extra
cost
is
slight
hot
water
and
how
to
get
it
we
have
named
the
essentials
for
use
in
a
bathroom
but
there
are
other
features
that
add
much
to
its
convenience
and
attractiveness
some
of
these
need
not
be
purchased
at
once
in
fact
it
is
better
here
as
elsewhere
in
the
house
to
let
many
things
wait
upon
a
demonstration
of
their
need
a
bathroom
without
plenty
of
hot
water
accessible
is
not
as
we
have
previously
hinted
likely
to
become
a
popular
resort
when
the
wash
boiler
and
the
tea
kettle
have
to
be
heated
on
the
range
and
brought
up
in
a
precarious
progress
that
threatens
a
scalding
for
fingers
feet
and
floors
to
even
hint
the
possibility
of
the
entire
insisting
upon
a
daily
hot
bath
suggests
lunacy
but
if
the
tank
is
dependent
upon
the
furnace
or
other
arrangement
summer
is
likely
to
find
it
out
of
commission
with
the
chief
element
of
a
good
bath
obtainable
only
with
much
ado
then
some
special
means
of
heating
water
is
required
there
are
many
devices
most
of
them
using
gas
and
disposed
to
be
cantankerous
late
at
night
when
all
but
the
bather
have
retired
the
gas
heaters
are
placed
either
in
connection
with
the
water
tank
in
kitchen
or
basement
or
above
the
tub
the
water
running
in
coils
over
the
heater
these
arrangements
are
speedy
and
comparatively
economical
they
are
slightly
dangerous
however
not
that
they
are
likely
to
explode
but
from
the
fact
that
the
gas
particularly
if
of
a
poor
quality
which
is
usually
the
case
rapidly
vitiates
the
air
of
the
room
and
may
cause
fainting
or
even
suffocation
if
the
apparatus
is
properly
adjusted
and
one
makes
sure
of
the
ventilation
heating
the
water
and
admitting
fresh
air
before
entering
the
tub
no
distress
need
be
anticipated
there
are
also
gasolene
and
kerosene
heaters
and
an
electric
coil
placed
in
the
water
is
the
safest
and
cleanest
but
not
the
quickest
or
cheapest
scheme
of
all
its
cost
is
from
to
none
of
these
heating
attachments
is
sure
to
prove
fully
satisfactory
but
any
one
of
them
is
likely
to
add
a
great
deal
to
the
serviceableness
of
the
bathroom
to
many
wholesome
people
one
ideal
of
living
is
to
be
able
to
take
a
dip
whenever
one
wants
it
not
merely
when
one
can
get
it
a
seat
of
wood
in
natural
finish
or
white
enamel
is
a
handy
appurtenance
to
the
tub
it
will
cost
us
or
cents
at
a
department
store
or
we
can
pay
four
or
five
times

much

a

at

bathroom

are
innumerable

the

hardly
be

come
as
near
as
any

the

a

at
the

will
keep
that
useful
article
within
reach
and
for
the
towels
there
are
bars
rings
and
projecting

brass
or
glass
bars
are
preferred
as
the
rings
are
elusive
affairs
for
both
hands
and
towels
while
the
projecting
arms
are
usually
unsubstantial
and
if
placed
too
high
constantly
threaten
to
stimulate
the
market
the
bars
if
strongly
attached
to
the
wall
sometimes
are
a
friend
in
need
when
one
is
getting
in

out
of

may
be
had
for
or
more
there
are

tumbler
holders
galore
and
some
one
of
these
arrangements
will
be
found
useful
the
kind
that
provides
for
a
toothpowder
box
and
has
numbered
compartments
for
brushes
is
best
though
there
is
something
to
be
said
for
the
retention
of
such
articles
within
the
private
domains
of
their
individual
owners
an
attachment
for
toilet
paper
may
be
had
for
a
quarter
or
for
a
dollar
and
a
workable
one
is
worth
while
as
is
a
good
quality
of
paper
a
glass
shelf
costing
anywhere
from

almost
a
necessity
but
there
are
better
places

a
attachment

the
simplest
sort
is
a
lot
better
than
none

not

the

these

at

corners
securely
nailed
to
the

of
the

above
is
almost
indispensable
to
the
convenience
of
the
cellar
it
should
be
about
three
feet

from
six

eight
feet
in
length

may
be
covered
on
three

wistfully
backward
to
that
place
of
hallowed

which
is
itself
becoming
simply
a
memory
the
attic
what
happy
hours
we
spent
there
rummaging
among
its
treasures
soothed
by
its
twilight
quiet
and
a
little
awed
by
the
ghosts
of
the
past
which
seemed
to
hover
about
each
old

now
gone
pushed
aside
by
the
march
of
civilization
supplanted
by
the
modern
lathed
and
plastered
attic
with
its
smoothly
laid
floor
which
harbors
neither
mice
nor
memories
and
though
we
sigh
as
we
say
so
the
attic
of
a
better
kept
more
compact
more
hygienic
affair
than
its
ancestor
for
we
have
grown
to
realize
that
sentiment
must
sometimes
be
sacrificed
to
sense
whatever
comes
we
must
have
hygiene
even
at
the
expense
of
the
little
spirit
germ
which
seems
sometimes
to
develop
best
in
the
dim
religious
light

we
can
not
forget
victor

tom
moore
in

frequently
so
much
of
the
attic
space
is
finished
off
for

and
other
rooms
that
what
remains
is
somewhat
limited
and
can
not
be
turned

as
well
as
the
small
boxes

and
the
hundred
odds
and
ends
of
hardware
which
the
lord
of
the
house
must
be
able
to
lay
his
hand
on
when
he
wants
to
do
any
tinkering
about
the
place
a
semiannual
sweeping
mopping
and
dusting
will
keep
the
attic
in
good
condition
if
thoroughly
done
with
the
help
of
the
place
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
place
a
precept
as
well
as
an
example
which
has
entered
prominently
into
the
upbringing
of
most
of
us
here
is
another
spot
where
corners
and
cobwebs
like
to
hobnob
and
such
intimacy
must
be
sternly
discouraged
if
old
garments
are
kept
in
the
attic
they
should
be
either
packed
away
in
labeled
boxes
or
trunks
or
hung
on
a
line
stretched
across
the
room
and
carefully
covered
with
an
old
sheet
this
line
is
also
serviceable
when
rainy
days
and
lack
of
other
room
make
it
necessary
to
dry
the
washing
here
the
modern
attic
is
for
utility
only
and
so
its
story
is
soon
told

if
woman

would
only
usurp

more
of
what
have

been
almost
exclusively
man
rights
the
profession
of
architecture
she
would
in
truth
become
the
architect
not
only
of
her
own
fortune
but
of
the
fortunes
of
a
suffering
sisterhood

great
plaint
is
so

no
place
to
put
them

who
ever
knew

of

boxes

seem
to
have
a
magic
way
of
disposing
of
themselves
somewhere
somewhen
somehow

so
it
does
not
occur
to
him
that
his

particular
clorinda
is
conducting
a
private
condensing

which
could
put
those
of
the

to
the

let
him
have
just
one
experience
of
straightening
out
and
putting
to
rights

then
only
will
he
appreciate
that
closets
are
even
more
essential
than
cozy
corners
and
unexpected
nooks
and
crannies
for
holding
pieces
of
statuary
and
collecting
dust
if
a
woman
could
be

company
of
every
firm
of

there
would
be
an
evolution
in

would
lengthen

also
invites

come
in

after

it

to

recourse
to
some
soft
harmonious
neutral
tint
will
be
necessary
lining
is
not
used
unless
there
is
an
objection
to
the
colored
curtain
showing
from
the
street
when
the
lining
silk
or
sateen
must
be
of
the
shade
of
the
lace
curtain
almost
any
sort
of
pretty
net
or
scrim
curtain
is
appropriate
for
the
downstairs
windows
with
a
preference
in
favor
of
the
more
dignified
lace
in
the
with
the
other
rooms
we
can
take
more
liberty
the
ruffled
curtain
is
sash
length
and
looped
with
a
band
of
the
same
or
with
a
white
cotton
cord
and
tassel
at
the
middle
sash
if
the
window
be
short
otherwise
midway
between
it
and
the
sill
there
are
fine
fish
nets
or
de
and
inches
wide
at
cents
a
yard
which
make
charming
or
curtains
edged
on
three
sides
with
the
new
fringe
or
fancy
edge
at
and
cents
a
yard
which
comes
for
that
purpose
and
madras
plain
or
figured
is
also
good
a
pretty
combination
being
the
fish
net
with
colored
madras
over
curtain
curtains
are
in
use
too
but
anything
which
stands
too
much
between
the
home
dwellers
and
the
air
and
light
is
best
avoided
silk
curtains
are
usually
trimmed
with
a
brush
edge
glass
curtains
are
only
necessary
as
a
screen
or
to
soften
the
harsh
outline
of
a
heavy
curtain
and
must
be
as
transparent
and
inconspicuous
as
possible
the
right
side
toward
the
glass
they
are
sill
length
shirred
to
a
small
brass
rod
set
inside
the
casing
and
draped
if
the
over
curtain
hangs
straight
to
maintain
a
balance
those
used
on
windows
visible
at
once
from
the
same
quarter
must
be
alike
the
lace
panels
with
a
center
design
which
we
sometimes
see
in
windows
but
more
frequently
in
doors
are
too
severe
to
be
either
graceful
or
ornamental
the
vestibule
door
is
best
treated
to
correspond
with
the
windows
with
an
additional
silk
curtain
to
be
drawn
at
night
or
the
silk
curtain
harmonizing
with
the
woodwork
of
the
hall
may
be
used
alone
the
curtaining
of
bedroom
windows
has
already
been
discussed
at
some
length
swisses
dimities
figured
muslins
and
madras
either
alone
or
supplemented
by
a
valance
an
over
curtain
or
both
of
madras
chintz
or
cretonne
are
preeminently
the
bedroom
curtains
and
may
either
be
draped
or
hang
straight
depending
somewhat
on
the
shape
of
the
window
the
long
narrow
window
needs
the
broadening
effect
of
the
draped
curtain
the
illusion
of
width
being
further
increased
by
extending
the
curtain
out
to
cover
the
casement
while
the
curtain
gives
additional
length
to
the
short
window
frilled
curtains
are
usually
looped
and
seemingly
increase
the
size
of
the
room
by
enlarging
the
area
of
vision
an
extra
allowance
of
inches
is
made
for
draping
with
an
additional
inch
or
two
for
shrinkage
the
charm
of
simplicity
is
always
to
be
borne
in
mind
when
curtaining
a
room
portières
portières
must
serve
their
purpose
which
is
most
emphatically
that
of
drapery
in
the
sense
in
which
the
word
has
been
so
much
used
but
of
convenience
and
utility
beauty
of
course
being
the
twin
sister
of
the
latter
nowadays
figured
portières
with
plain
walls
and
vice
versa
are
the
rule
the
coloring
blending
with
both
floor
and
walls
and
coming
between
the
two
in
density
again
the
neutral
tint
comes
to
the
rescue
if
difficulty
in
matching
is
met
there
is
almost
an
embarrassment
of
riches
in
portière
materials
in
plain
and
figured
velours
woolen
brocades
soft
tapestries
furniture
satins
damasks
velvets
but
we
are
learning
the
true
art
value
of
the
simpler
denims
plain
and
fancy
reps
cotton
tapestries
rough
heavy
linens
and
monk
cloth
a
kind
of
jute
for
door
hangings
the
plain
goods
in
dull
soft
greens
blues
and
browns
with
conventional
designs
in
appliqué
or
outlining
are
not
only
inexpensive
but
artistic
to
a
high
degree
and
are
easily
fashioned
by
home
talent
plain
strips
too
are
used
for
trimming
and
stencil
work
but
the
latter
requires
rather
more
artistic
ability
than
most
of
us
possess
whatever
the
material
it
must
be
soft
enough
to
draw
all
the
way
back
and
leave
a
full
opening
but
not
so
thin
as
to
be
flimsy
and
stringy
the
portiere
is
either
shirred
over
the
pole
or
hung
from
it
by
hook
safety
pins
or
rings
sewed
on
at
intervals
of
four
inches
goods
have
the
hems
on
the
side
on
which
they
will
show
least
with
any
extra
length
turned
over
as
a
valance
on
the
same
side
the
finished
curtain
should
hang
one
inch
from
the
floor
and
will
gradually
stretch
until
it
just
escapes
the
proper
length
materials
are
lined
to
harmonize
with
the
room
which
receives
the
wrong
side
lengthwise
stripes
give
a
long
narrow
effect
while
crosswise
stripes
give
an
apparent
additional
width
and
plain
materials
seem
to
increase
the
size
of
a
doorway
rods
may
be
either
of
a
wood
corresponding
with
the
other
woodwork
or
of
brass
with
rings
sockets
and
brackets
of
the
same
material
the
brass
rod
to
be
an
inch
in
diameter
and
the
wooden
inches
or
more
and
set
inside
the
jambs
portières
are
also
of
service
in
softening
the
opening
of
a
large
bay
window
making
a
cozy
corner
or
cutting
off
an
awkward
length
of
hall
when
a
doorway
is
very
high
it
is
better
to
carry
the
portière
to
within
a
foot
or
so
of
the
top
leaving
the
opening
unfilled
or
supplying
a
simple
grille
of
wood
harmonizing
with
the
wood
of
the
door
a
pretty
fashion
is
to
introduce
into
this
space
a
shelf
on
which
to
place
pieces
of
brass
or
pottery
beaded
bamboo
and
rope
affairs
are
neither
draperies
nor
curtains
graceful
useful
nor
ornamental
and
are
consequently
not
to
be
considered
men
of
science
may
cry
down
with
draperies
but
we
members
of
that
choicer
cult
known
as
domestic
science
stand
loyally
by
them
for
though
in
draperies
there
may
he
microbes
there
is
also
largess
of
coziness
and
geniality
the
whatnot
with
its
hungrily
gaping
shelves
is
responsible
for
many
crimes
committed
in
the
name
of
and
calls
to
mind
sundry
specimens
with
which
proud
owners
were
wont
to
satisfy
its
greed
the
glass
case
of
wax
or
feather
flowers
flanked
and
reenforced
by
plush
photograph
frames
shells
china
vases
shining
giltily
silvered
and
beribboned
toasters
fans
with
perhaps
a
cup
and
saucer
bearing
testimony
to
our
virtue
with
its
for
a
good
girl
and
other
gone
but
not
forgotten
and
then
followed
a
time
when
mantels
and
bookcase
tops
bore
certain
ills
in
the
way
of
the
more
modern
painted
plaques
strings
of
gilded
nuts
embroidered
banners
and
porcelain
and
brass
clocks
so
gaudy
and
bedizened
as
to
explain
why
time
flies
but
the
architect
has
come
to
the
rescue
with
his
dignified
stately
mantel
which
repels
the
trivial
familiarity
of
meaningless
decoration
and
the
bookcase
whose
simple
quiet
elegance
is
in
itself
decorative
blessed
be
the
nothingness
which
allows
miladi
to
build
her
own
art
atmosphere
untainted
by
gifts
of
but
tasteless
friends
the
growth
of
good
taste
the
germs
of
the
capacity
for
good
taste
are
born
in
most
of
us
but
must
be
sedulously
cultivated
before
they
can
rightly
be
called
taste
and
presents
the
best
of
possibilities
for
their
development
begin
by
buying
one
piece
which
you
know
to
be
beautiful
simple
and
refined
in
outline
choice
in
design
modest
in
coloring
and
fit
for
the
use
to
which
it
is
to
be
put
live
with
it
study
it
master
it
it
will
take
on
many
unexpected
charms
as
you
grow
to
know
it
and
when
you
are
ready
to
select
the
next
piece
you
will
find
that
the
germ
of
your
talent
for
discrimination
has
quietly
become
other
ten
talents
and
grown
into
a
reliable
ability
to
separate
the
chaff
from
the
wheat
each
acquisition
will
have
its
own
peculiar
individuality
which
once
conquered
means
a
liberal
education
usefulness
with
beauty
while
all
should
be
beautiful
some
certain
kinds
such
as
lamps
clocks
and
jardinières
are
also
essentially
useful
and
these
have
undergone
a
wonderful
transformation
during
recent
years
as
a
result
of
the
movement
toward
simplicity
honesty
of
purpose
and
fitness
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
anything
more
incongruous
than
the
porcelain
lamp
decorated
with
flowers
of
heroic
endurance
which
blossomed
unwiltingly
on
regardless
of
the
heat
or
the
frivolously
decorated
clock
when
the
passing
of
time
is
so
serious
a
matter
or
the
gaudy
jardinière
whose
coloring
killed
the
green
of
the
plant
it
held
but
we
have
grown
past
this
now
our
light
at
eventide
is
shed
through
a
simple
shade
of
porcelain
or
of
japan
paper
and
bamboo
if
one
can
not
afford
the
plain
or
mosaic
shades
of
opalescent
glass
from
an
oil
tank
fitted
into
a
bowl
of
brass
or
copper
or
of
pottery
of
which
there
are
so
many
beautiful
pieces
of
american
manufacture
in
dull
greens
blues
browns
grays
and
reds
these
lamps
are
not
expensive
no
more
so
than
their
onyx
and
brass
forbears
and
are
quiet
restful
beneficent
in
their
influence
jardinières
we
find
in
the
same
wares
and
colorings
which
not
only
throw
the
plant
into
relief
but
tone
in
with
the
other
decorations
of
a
room
in
which
nothing
stands
out
distinct
from
its
fellows
but
all
things
work
together
for
harmony
clocks
no
longer
stare
us
out
of
countenance
but
follow
in
brass
copper
or
rich
dark
woods
the
sturdy
simplicity
of
their
ancestor
the
grandfather
clock
and
so
become
worthy
of
the
place
of
honor
upon
the
mantel
where
candlesticks
antique
or
modern
in
brass
or
bronze
also
find
a
congenial
resting
place
illustration
the
considerations
in
buying
there
are
so
many
vases
jugs
bronzes
medallions
jars
and
bowls
that
one
must
needs
walk
steadfastly
to
avoid
buying
just
for
the
pleasure
of
it
whereas
each
piece
must
be
chosen
with
reference
to
the
place
it
is
to
occupy
and
to
its
associates
any
piece
of
genuine
japanese
art
ware
of
which
cloisonné
is
perhaps
the
best
known
old
or
ancestral
china
objects
of
historical
interest
different
examples
of
american
pottery
among
others
the
grueby
van
briggle
and
teco
with
their
soft
dull
glazes
and
the
rookwood
with
its
brilliantly
glazed
rich
mellow
browns
its
delicately
tinted
dull
iris
glaze
and
other
styles
which
are
being
brought
out
wedgwood
with
its
reliefs
the
favrile
glass
the
copenhagen
in
dull
blues
and
grays
all
these
embody
each
in
its
individual
way
the
requirements
of
art
but
the
brown
rookwood
will
overshadow
the
copenhagen
and
the
multicolored
cloisonné
will
kill
the
iris
and
so
each
piece
must
have
a
congenial
companion
if
any
and
above
all
do
crowd
needs
breathing
room
and
individual
beauty
is
lost
in
the
jumbling
together
of
many
pieces
in
a
heterogeneous
maze
of
color
which
confuses
and
wearies
the
eye
all
the
product
asks
is
to
be
let
alone
a
small
boon
to
grant
to
so
great
worth
flower
holders
defeat
their
own
ends
utility
but
there
are
many
which
are
well
balanced
and
beautiful
too
tall
cut
bohemian
or
more
simple
glass
for
roses
carnations
or
daisies
brown
van
briggle
grueby
or
rookwood
bowls
for
nasturtiums
golden
rod
and
susans
green

hollyhocks
dull

for
dahlias
gladioli

and
receptacles
thus
forming
a
true
color
symphony
parian
and
carrara
marble
immortally
beautiful
we
can
but
gaze
at
from
afar
but
masterpieces
of
the
sculptor

are
ours
at
small
cost
in
plaster
reproductions
of
the
venus
de

the
winged

busts
and

of
famous
personages
which
may
with
truth
be
called

of
whatever
occupies
the
plate

an
interesting
array
of
plates
pitchers
bowls
jars
cups
and
saucers
steins
cider
mugs
and
tankards
and
here
our
cherished
ancestral
china
finds
a
safe
haven
from
which
it
surveys
its
young
modern
descendants
with
benignant
toleration
books
a
spirit
of
friendliness
and
companionship
radiates
from
a
good
book
a
geniality
to
be
not
only
felt
but
cultivated
and
enjoyed
the
friendship
of
man
is
sometimes
and
evanescent
but
the
friendship
of
books
abideth
ever
paraphrasing
thanatopsis
for
our
gayer
hours
they
have
a
voice
of
gladness
and
a
smile
and
eloquence
of
beauty
and
they
glide
into
our
darker
musings
with
a
mild
and
healing
sympathy
that
steals
away
their
sharpness
ere
we
are
aware
truly
a
book
for
every
mood
and
a
mood
for
every
book
their
selection
the
true
measure
of
a
book
is
not
how
well
does
it
entertain
but
how
much
help
does
it
give
in
the
daily
struggle
to
overcome
the
bad
with
the
good
and
as
one
makes
friends
with
authors
the
fancy
for
acquaintances
among
books
gradually
wears
away
although
different
tastes
require
special
gratification
in
certain
directions
yet
some
few
books
must
have
place
in
every
library
first
always
the
bible
with
concordance
complete
for
study
purposes
a
set
of
shakespeare
in
small
easily
handled
volumes
a
set
of
encyclopaedias
and
a
standard
dictionary
then
some
of
the
best
known
poets
milton
spenser
pope
goldsmith
burns
wordsworth
keats
shelley
the
brownings
byron
homer
dante
with
longfellow
riley
and
some
others
of
our
american
poets
for
though
we
may
not
care
for
poetry
we
can
not
afford
to
deny
ourselves
its
elevating
influence
standard
histories
of
our
own
and
other
countries
familiar
letters
of
great
men
which
also
mirror
their
times
horace
walpole
lord
macaulay
etc
essays
of
bacon
addison
dequincey
lamb
irving
emerson
lowell
and
holmes
and
certain
works
of
fiction
which
have
stood
the
test
of
time
and
criticism
with
dickens
and
thackeray
heading
the
list
indulgence
in
all
the
popular
novels
of
the
day
like
any
other
dissipation
profits
nothing
and
vitiates
one
taste
for
good
literature
at
the
same
time
therefore
hold
fast
that
which
is
known
to
be
good
in
novels
with
here
and
there
just
a
little
spice
of
recent
fiction
for
man
can
not
live
by
spice
alone
which
causes
a
sort
of
mental
dyspepsia
which
is
very
hard
to
overcome
sets
an
appetite
for
complete
sets
is
a
perverted
one
which
usually
goes
with
a
love
for
the
shell
of
the
book
rather
than
its
meat
it
is
better
far
to
prune
out
the
obscure
works
and
buy
a
few
at
a
time
if
necessary
the
best
known
works
of
favorite
authors
than
to
clutter
up
one
bookshelves
with
volumes
which
will
never
be
opened
partial
sets
acquired
in
this
way
can
be
of
uniform
edition
and
gain
in
value
from
those
which
are
left
in
the
shop
binding
books
like
our
other
friends
have
an
added
attraction
if
tastily
clothed
good
cloth
bindings
not
too
ornate
or
strong
in
color
are
substantial
and
usually
best
for
the
home
library
real
leather
bindings
of
morocco
or
pigskin
are
rich
and
suggestive
of
good
food
within
but
imitation
leather
must
join
other
domestic
outcasts
though
it
may
look
well
at
first
it
soon
shows
its
quality
of
calf
has
deteriorated
because
of
the
modern
quick
method
of
tanning
by
the
use
of
acids
which
dries
the
skin
and
causes
it
to
crack
books
in
party
attire
of
white
paper
and
parchment
and
very
delicate
colors
are
not
good
comrades
for
the
paper
cover
which
must
be
put
on
to
protect
the
binding
is
a
nuisance
while
without
it
touch
me
not
seems
to
be
written
all
over
the
book
our
best
book
friends
are
not
of
this
kind
but
permit
us
to
be
on
terms
of
friendly
intimacy
with
them
receiving
as
their
reward
all
due
meed
of
courteous
treatment
there
can
be
no
true
reverence
for
books
in
the
heart
of
the
vandal
who
leaves
marks
of
disrespectful
soiled
fingers
on
their
pages
turns
down
their
leaves
and
breaks
their
backs
by
laying
them
open
face
down
paper
their
paper
should
be
of
a
good
quality
not
too
heavy
and
the
type
clear
both
of
which
conditions
usually
obtain
in
an
book
their
housing
has
much
to
do
with
their
preservation
dampness
is
perhaps
their
deadliest
enemy
not
only
rotting
and
loosening
the
covers
but
mildewing
the
leaves
and
taking
out
the
size
which
gives
them
body
an
outside
wall
is
always
more
or
less
damp
and
for
this
reason
the
bookcase
must
stand
out
from
it
at
least
a
foot
if
it
stands
there
at
all
and
preferably
at
right
angles
to
it
dust
is
also
an
insidious
enemy
from
which
in
very
sooty
dirty
localities
glass
doors
afford
the
best
protection
these
must
be
left
open
occasionally
to
ventilate
the
case
for
books
must
have
air
and
light
to
keep
them
fresh
and
sweet
and
free
from
dampness
but
not
sun
to
fade
their
covers
intense
artificial
heat
also
affects
them
badly
wherefore
the
upper
part
of
the
room
being
the
hotter
cases
should
never
be
more
than
eight
feet
high
the
use
of
window
seat
and
other
low
cases
having
very
decided
advantages
apart
from
their
decorative
value
whatever
the
design
of
the
case
and
of
course
it
must
harmonize
with
the
other
wood
of
the
room
its
shelves
must
be
easily
adjustable
to
books
of
different
heights
standing
in
compact
rows
and
not
half
opened
to
become
permanently
warped
and
spoiled
varnished
or
painted
shelves
grow
sticky
with
heat
and
form
a
strong
attachment
for
their
contents
the
bookcase
curtain
is
useful
more
as
a
protection
against
dust
than
as
an
art
adjunct
for
there
is
nothing
more
delightful
to
the
cultivated
eye
than
the
brave
front
presented
by
even
symmetrical
rows
of
volumes
so
suggestive
of
hours
of
profitable
companionship
all
the
books
must
be
taken
down
frequently
and
first
beaten
separately
then
in
pairs
and
dusted
top
and
covers
with
a
soft
brush
or
a
small
feather
duster
the
true
university
of
these
days
is
a
collection
of
books
and
education
can
not
begin
too
early
pictures
so
many
homes
combining
taste
and
elegance
and
refinement
in
their
furnishing
still
impress
one
with
the
feeling
that
somewhere
within
the
lute
there
is
a
rift
which
destroys
its
perfect
harmony
and
that
rift
is
not
far
to
seek
it
lies
in
the
pictures
cheap
chromos
lithographs
and
woodcuts
have
small
excuse
for
being
in
these
days
of
fine
reproductions
in
photographs
photogravures
and
engravings
and
their
presence
in
a
home
indicates
not
only
a
lopsided
development
of
the
artistic
sense
but
an
indifference
to
that
beauty
of
which
art
is
but
one
of
the
expressions
happy
indeed
is
the
homemaker
in
realizing
the
necessity
and
privilege
of
growing
up
to
the
works
of
artists
who
have
seen
beauty
where
she
would
have
been
blind
and
felt
to
a
depth
which
she
has
not
known
for
in
that
realization
lies
the
promise
of
ability
to
rise
to
the
point
where
she
will
at
last
be
able
to
feel
as
the
artist
felt
when
he
wrought
art
sense
lofty
who
never
has
to
stop
to
count
the
cost
loses
the
valuable
art
education
which
our
housewife
all
unconsciously
acquires
in
the
months
which
necessarily
pass
between
her
picture
purchases
months
in
which
she
has
time
to
discover
new
beauties
fresh
interest
deeper
meaning
in
those
she
already
has
all
these
new
impressions
she
carries
with
her
to
the
selection
of
her
next
treasure
and
the
result
will
probably
be
a
choice
of
greater
artistic
merit
than
she
would
have
been
capable
of
making
before
so
long
as
there
is
something
in
a
picture
which
impresses
her
the
fact
that
she
does
not
fully
understand
its
underlying
meaning
need
be
no
obstacle
to
its
purchase
the
light
of
comprehension
will
come
the
influence
of
pictures
the
picturing
of
the
home
should
be
undertaken
in
no
light
humor
for
better
no
pictures
at
all
than
poor
ones
little
trivial
meaningless
nothings
are
like
small
talk
uninspiring
and
devitalizing
and
therefore
unprofitable
battle
and
other
exciting
scenes
wear
on
the
nerves
the
constant
presence
of
many
persons
is
tiring
in
pictures
as
well
as
out
small
figures
and
fine
detail
which
can
not
be
distinguished
across
the
room
cause
visual
cramp
and
the
rearing
horse
which
keeps
one
longing
for
the
rockers
can
not
be
called
reposeful
any
picture
in
which
one
seeks
in
vain
the
rest
and
peace
and
quietude
and
inspiration
which
the
home
harmony
demands
is
but
a
travesty
of
art
domestically
speaking
there
is
probably
nothing
more
than
the
marine
view
and
next
come
the
pretty
pastoral
and
cool
woodland
scenes
while
madonnas
and
other
pictures
of
religious
significance
express
their
own
worth
just
a
few
choice
photographs
etchings
and
engravings
of
agreeable
subjects
with
a
painting
or
two
that
all
we
want
oil
paintings
really
fine
oils
are
costly
and
no
house
can
stand
more
than
one
or
two
at
most
because
of
the
impossibility
of
giving
them
the
correct
lighting
and
the
distance
they
require
without
which
their
best
effect
is
lost
properly
an
oil
painting
should
be
given
a
wall
or
even
a
whole
room
to
itself
as
water
colors
and
colored
prints
seem
colorless
and
cold
by
comparison
the
deep
gold
frame
is
its
best
setting
gold
frames
and
mats
are
usually
effective
on
colored
pictures
of
any
kind
in
bringing
out
certain
colors
dark
ones
especially
though
artists
are
growing
to
use
wood
frames
filled
to
harmonize
with
and
throw
into
relief
some
one
tone
in
the
picture
the

the

has
no
place

are
used
toning

things
of

an
inexpensive
substitute

of

white
mats
are
still
in

for

we
find
a
more
grateful
warmth
in
following
the
tone
of

and
photogravures
most
satisfactorily
reproduce

work
always
has
more
life
than

all
reproductions
however
bring
the
works
of
artists
within

us
to
be
on

amateur
photography
with
its

in

is
making
rapid
strides
and
doing
much
to
advance
the
cause
of
art
in
the
home
the
photograph
is
acceptable
if
the
coloring
is
true
and
rightly
applied
while
certain
charming
colored
french
prints
so
like
water
colors
as
to
be
hardly
distinguishable
from
them
have
distinct
worth
then
there
are
the
reproductions
of
our
illustrators
in
both
and
colors
and
in
which
we
seem
to
have
a
personal
interest
originals
are
always
costly
and
hard
to
get
the
exception
being
the
obscure
but
worthy
artist
whose
fame
and
fortune
are
yet
to
be
won
the

a
valuable

may
be
hung
with
propriety
in
almost
any
of
the

of

pictures
having
historic

suggestive

the

wherever
musical

may
be
dignified
subjects
such
as

with

used
to
hang
in
the

of

while
we
now
picture
our

room
with
pretty
landscapes
or
anything
else
cheery
and
attractive
family

if
we
must
have
them

better
in

but
really
their

is
better
than
their
company
as
a
rule
hanging
of

as
to
hanging

the
main
thing
is
to
have
them
on
a
level
with
the
eye
and
each
subject
in
a
good
light
dark

light
parts
of

small
pictures
are
most
effective
in
groups
hung
somewhat
irregularly
and
compactly
all
pictures
lie
close
to
the
wall
suspended
by
either
gilt
or
silvered
wire
whichever
tones
best
with
the
wall
decoration
the
use
of
two
separate
wires
each
attached
to
its
own
hook
is
preferable
to
the
one
wire
whose
triangular
effect
is
inharmonious
with
the
horizontal
and
vertical
lines
of
the
room
small
pictures
are
best
hung
with
their
wires
invisible
thus
avoiding
a
network
on
the
walls

solomon
grundy
born
on
monday
christened
on
tuesday
married
on
wednesday
took
ill
on
thursday
worse
on
friday
died
on
saturday
buried
on
sunday
that
the
end
of
solomon
grundy
this
little
tale
serves
to
show
how
it
simplifies
life
to
have
a
time
for
everything
and
everything
in
its
time
system
was
probably
a
habit
in
the
grundy
family
and
was
so
bred
in
solomon
bones
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
reverse
the
order
observed
by
the
grundys
for
generations
back
and
be
married
on
thursday
for
instance
and
yet
there
is
room
for
conjecture
as
to
how
much
difference
it
might
have
made
in
his
life
if
he
had
elected
to
contract
an
alliance
on
that
day
instead
of
a
fatal
illness
system
is
a
fine
servant
but
a
poor
master
simply
because
custom
has
decreed
that
monday
shall
be
wash
day
tuesday
ironing
day
and
so
on
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
this
programme
must
be
strictly
adhered
to
in
every
family
or
that
the
schedule
of
the
week
work
once
made
out
can
not
be
changed
to
meet
the
unexpected
exigencies
which
are
apt
to
arise
to
be
sure
monday
as
wash
day
has
many
points
in
its
favor
but
if
it
must
be
postponed
until
tuesday
or
the
clothes
have
not
dried
well
and
the
ironing
has
to
go
over
into
wednesday
there
is
no
reason
why
the
whole
domestic
harmony
should
become
like
sweet
bells
jangled
out
of
tune
and
harsh
although
order
is
heaven
first
law
it
occasionally
happens
that
it
is
better
to
break
the
law
than
to
be
broken
by
it
and
so
when
the
young
housekeeper
nicely
arranged
plans
for
each
day
in
the
week
are
suddenly
turned
let
her
take
heart
of
grace
remembering
that
there
are
whole
days
that
ai
teched
yet
and
begin
again
monday
the
chief
objection
to
washing
on
monday
is
that
it
necessitates
sorting
and
putting
the
soiled
linen
to
soak
on
sunday
which
not
only
violates
the
religious
principles
of
many
households
but
shortens
and
spoils
the
flavor
of
the
maid
free
sabbath
evening
then
too
the
sorting
of
the
linen
often
reveals
holes
and
rents
which
should
properly
be
repaired
before
laundering
increases
the
damage
and
a
tuesday
washing
makes
this
possible
with
the
straightening
out
and
readjustment
generally
necessary
after
sunday
on
the
other
hand
the
longer
the
linen
remains
unlaundered
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
cleanse
with
the
risk
that
good
drying
days
may
tarry
and
the
ironing
thus
linger
along
till
the
end
of
the
week
which
is
inconvenient
and
bothersome
all
round
therefore
it
seems
quite
advisable
for
grundy
to
wash
on
monday
and
an
occasional
postponement
until
tuesday
will
not
then
be
a
matter
of
any
great
moment
the
routine
work
of
every
day
the
airing
brushing
up
and
dusting
of
the
rooms
the
preparation
and
serving
of
meals
at
their
regular
hours
the
chamber
work
in
short
all
the
must
not
and
need
not
be
interfered
with
by
the
special
work
which
belongs
to
each
day
there
are
hours
enough
for
both
and
rest
time
too
unless
the
housekeeper
or
maid
be
cut
after
the
pattern
of
chaucer
sergeant
of
the
law
nowher
so
bisy
a
man
as
he
ther
nas
and
yet
he
semed
bisier
than
he
was
wash
day
is
always
somewhat
of
an
ordeal
and
a
long
pull
a
strong
pull
and
a
pull
all
together
is
necessary
to
carry
it
successfully
through
a
simple
breakfast
will
give
the
maid
an
opportunity
to
sort
and
put
the
clothes
to
soak
if
this
was
not
done
the
night
previous
heat
water
for
the
washing
and
perhaps
prepare
vegetables
for
the
day
meals
before
breakfast
is
served
and
if
her
mistress
lends
a
helping
hand
with
the
dishes
dusting
or
other
regular
work
of
the
day
she
can
go
to
her
tubs
just
that
much
earlier
getting
up
in
the
wee
sma
hours
and
working
by
early
candle
light
is
misdirected
ambition
the
maid
needs
her
rest
to
fit
her
for
her
day
labors
and
washing
well
done
requires
the
light
of
day
set
the
breakfast
hour
ahead
half
an
hour
and
so
gain
a
little
extra
time
foresight
and
extra
planning
on
saturday
will
provide
certain
from
sunday
meals
which
can
be
quickly
and
easily
transformed
into
monday
luncheon
dinner
too
should
be
a
simple
meal
but
do
add
to
the
other
trials
of
the
day
cold
comfort
at
meal
time
a
dinner
has
a
certain
heartening
influence
to
which
we
are
all
more
or
less
susceptible
the
doors
leading
from
the
room
in
which
the
washing
is
done
must
be
kept
closed
to
exclude
the
steamy
odor
from
the
rest
of
the
house
and
the
maid
allowed
to
proceed
with
her
work
without
interruption
by
eleven
she
will
probably
have
reached
a
point
where
she
can
stop
to
prepare
luncheon
if
the
family
is
very
small
she
can
frequently
do
not
only
the
washing
but
considerable
of
the
ironing
as
well
on
monday
but
that
is
crowding
things
a
little
too
much
after
the
washing
is
accomplished
the
line
should
be
drawn
at
what
be
done
and
nothing
which
is
not
absolutely
necessary
put
into
the
few
remaining
hours
of
the
day
for
the
maid
back
and
arms
have
had
quite
enough
exercise
for
the
time
being
if
a
laundress
is
employed
the
cleaning
of
the
kitchen
floor
and
the
laundry
and
the
ironing
should
be
about
accomplished
by
night
unless
it
seems
best
to
have
her
clean
and
do
other
extra
work
after
the
washing
is
finished
if
the
housewife
is
her
own
laundress
she
must
acquire
the
gentle
art
of
letting
things
go
on
the
hard
days
for
she
can
not
possibly
be
laundress
maid
and
all
in
one
and
her
health
and
are
of
prime
importance
tuesday
the
washing
being
done
on
monday
it
naturally
follows
that
grundy
irons
on
tuesday
after
the
regular
routine
work
has
been
dispatched
the
first
thought
is
the
fire
if
the
ironing
is
done
by
a
coal
range
after
breakfast
is
prepared
the
fire
box
should
be
filled
with
coal
to
the
top
of
the
lining
and
draughts
opened
to
be
closed
as
soon
as
the
surface
coal
begins
to
burn
red
the
top
of
the
stove
brushed
off
and
the
irons
set
on
to
heat
this
is
a
good
place
to
sandwich
in
a
little
baking
before
the
fire
becomes
too
hot
for
cakes
or
delicate
pastry
if
the
maid
feels
that
she
must
devote
this
time
to
the
preparation
of
vegetables
or
to
other
work
which
is
liable
to
interfere
with
her
work
later
on
madam
may
choose
to
step
into
the
breach
and
try
her
hand
at
sundry
delectables
for
the
luncheon
or
dinner
both
meals
being
as
simple
as
consistent
with
comfort
and
health
the
ironing
once
commenced
should
continue
uninterruptedly
until
time
to
prepare
luncheon
when
the
irons
are
pushed
back
and
the
fire
shaken
or
raked
and
replenished
by
this
time
the
clothes
bars
should
begin
to
take
on
a
comfortable
look
of
fullness
it
is
well
to
keep
them
covered
with
cheesecloth
as
a
protection
from
dust
and
soot
and
in
summer
fly
specks
if
any

until
it
is
over
and
the

thoroughly
aired

the
odor
will
cling
to
the
clothes
after
luncheon
the

is
cleaned
and
the

drawn
forward
to
heat
for
the

session
and
by
the

the

brushed
up
both
they
and
the
maid
are
ready
for
the
renewed
onslaught
though
it
may
occasionally
run
over
into
the
next
day
the
average
ironing
ought
to
be
completed
during

spread
out

tuesday
though
a

is
so
clean
and
neat
that
there
is
no
reason
why
the
maid
should
not
keep
herself
equally
so
and
be
ready
to
serve
the

and
attend
the

without
further
preparation
than
slipping
on
her
white
apron
and
cap
if
she
wears
one
wednesday
on
wednesday
grundy
mends
and
puts
away
the
clean
clothes
and
picks
up
some
of
the
household
stitches
which
had
to
be
dropped
on
the
two
preceding
days
the
kitchen
must
be
put
in
order
the
refrigerator
must
have
its
semiweekly
cleaning
and
the
ashes
which
have
accumulated
in
the
stove
removed
a
new
fire
built
and
the
hearth
washed
while
the
oven
is
heating
for
the
baking
there
are
vestibules
and
porches
to
wash
walks
to
sweep
the
cellar
to
investigate
and
a
dozen
little
odds
and
ends
to
attend
to
which
with
the
baking
make
a
busy
morning
the
cleaning
of
silver
dovetails
nicely
with
the
wednesday
work
and
during
the
canning
season
the
preserving
of
fruit
can
be
done
at
this
time
with
the
least
interference
with
the
other
work
of
the
house
though
when
it
becomes
a
case
of
the
fruit
being
ripe
other
work
must
give
way
for
the
nonce
in
short
wednesday
is
the
general
weekly
into
which
go
all
the
odd
jobs
for
which
room
can
not
be
found
elsewhere
thursday
it
is
grundy
theory
strengthened
by
practical
experience
that
it
is
better
to
extend
the
weekly
sweeping
and
cleaning
over
two
days
than
to
condense
it
all
into
one
and
so
phyllis
takes
the
bedroom
cleaning
as
her
special
thursday
work
and
armed
with
broom
dustpan
pail
and
cleaning
cloths
she
ascends
to
the
upper
regions
as
soon
as
she
has
reduced
the
lower
to
their
everyday
nicety
the
daily
brushing
up
with
broom
or
carpet
sweeper
removes
the
surface
dirt
but
sweeping
day
means
a
good
digging
out
she
commences
operations
by
sweeping
out
the
closet
and
wiping
off
the
floor
with
a
cloth
wrung
out
of
hot
borax
water
then
she
brushes
down
rolls
or
folds
all
curtains
and
draperies
and
fastens
them
up
as
near
the
pole
as
possible
perhaps
slipping
a
case
over
each
as
a
protection
from
the
dust
if
the
bed
is
hung
with
a
valance
that
too
is
pinned
up
all
small
toilet
articles
and
knicknacks
are
dusted
and
placed
on
the
bed
and
covered
with
a
dust
sheet
of
coarse
unbleached
muslin
or
calico
bowl
pitcher
and
other
crockery
are
washed
and
dried
inside
and
out
and
placed
in
the
closet
with
dresser
and
stand
covers
which
have
been
shaken
out
of
the
window
these
if
soiled
are
relegated
to
the
clothes
hamper
to
be
replaced
by
fresh
ones
chairs
and
easily
moved
articles
of
furniture
are
dusted
and
set
outside
of
the
room
if
there
is
a
fire
the
ashes
are
carefully
removed
and
brushed
from
the
stove
the
windows
are
opened
unless
there
is
a
strong
wind
when
they
are
opened
a
little
after
the
cleaning
is
done
and
the
sweeping
begins
the
broom
should
be
of
about
medium
weight
held
almost
perpendicularly
and
passed
over
the
carpet
with
a
long
light
stroke
and
steady
pressure
which
will
not
scatter
the
dirt
and
turned
every
few
strokes
that
both
sides
may
receive
equal
wear
steps
can
be
saved
by
sweeping
to
a
central
point
going
with
the
nap
of
the
carpet
never
against
it
taking
special
care
to
dislodge
the
dust
which
gathers
between
the
edges
of
the
carpet
and
the
baseboard
shreds
of
dampened
paper
or
damp
bran
scattered
over
the
carpet
facilitate
its
cleaning
or
in
lieu
of
these
the
broom
may
be
wet
and
shaken
as
free
from
water
as
possible
before
using
any
method
of
keeping
down
the
dust
saves
much
cleaning
of
woodwork
walls
and
pictures
rugs
are
swept
in
the
same
way
as
carpets
after
they
are
cleaned
the
edges
are
turned
up
and
the
bare
floor
gone
over
with
a
hair
brush
or
with
a
broom
covered
with
a
bag
if
the
floor
is
painted
follow
the
duster
with
a
damp
cloth
if
hardwood
rub
well
with
a
flannel
slightly
moistened
with
crude
oil
and
turpentine
small
rugs
are
taken
out
of
doors
and
shaken
or
beaten
they
must
be
held
by
the
sides
never
by
the
ends
matting
should
be
swept
with
a
soft
broom
and
wiped
over
with
a
damp
cloth
using
as
little
water
as
possible
and
no
soap
which
stains
and
discolors
it
rubbing
with
a
cloth
wrung
out
of
hot
water
will
usually
take
out
the
spots
which
the
regular
cleaning
has
failed
to
remove
while
grease
spots
yield
to
the
application
of
a
thin
paste

for
three
days
and
then

not

a
thorough
sweeping
oftener
than
every
two
weeks
a
whisk
broom
and
carpet
sweeper
sufficing
between
times
while
the
dust
is
settling
put
a
fresh
bag
or
a
clean
soft
duster
on
the
broom
and
brush
off
ceiling
and
walls
using
a
straight
downward
stroke
for
the
latter
the
cloth
must
be
renewed
when
it
becomes
soiled
a
feather
duster
is
handy
for
cleaning
moldings
and
cornices
this
by
the
way
is
the
only
legitimate
use
to
which
a
feather
duster
can
be
put
in
addition
to
dusting
books
and
the
backs
and
wires
of
pictures
instead
of
taking
up
the
dust
it
simply
sets
it
free
to
settle
elsewhere
making
a
lingering
trouble
long
drawn
out
for
though
one
may
whisk
around
with
it
and
then
enjoy
the
conscious
virtue
which
comes
with
having
one
more
thing
out
of
the
way
the
complacency
is
and
the
cheesecloth
duster
finally
has
to
come
to
the
rescue
all
dusters
should
be
hemmed
otherwise
the
ravelings
are
apt
to
catch
and
pull
down
the
after
the
walls
phyllis
dusts
the
woodwork
and
goes
over
it
with
a
clean
damp
cloth
not
omitting
doorknobs
and
looking
out
for
finger
marks
in
likely
places
if
these
are
stubborn
a
little
kerosene
in
the
cleaning
water
will
help
on
the
good
work
she
brushes
and
wipes
off
the
window
casings
and
gas
fixtures
dusts
and
replaces
the
furniture
polishes
the
mirrors
and
washes
the
windows
the
last
thing
provided
the
sun
is
not
shining
on
them
at
this
time
if
so
the
work
will
have
to
be
deferred
and
slipped
in
with
special
work
of
some
other
time
in
localities
where
there
is
little
smoke
the
weekly
washing
may
be
dispensed
with
dusting
off
each
pane
with
a
soft
cloth
being
all
that
is
necessary
in
freezing
weather
this
is
the
only
cleaning
possible
though
if
the
glass
is
much
soiled
it
can
be
gone
over
with
a
sponge
wet
with
alcohol
or
with
whiting
mixed
with
diluted
alcohol
or
ammonia
followed
by
much
the
same
rubbing
process
employed
in
cleaning
silver
with
a
final
polishing
with
soft
paper
tissue
preferably
which
gives
the
finest
possible
shine
to
any
vitreous
surface
if
there
are
inside
or
outside
blinds
they
must
be
well
brushed
and
casings
and
sills
which
are
much
soiled
washed
before
the
glass
is
cleaned
the
requirements
for
successful
window
cleaning
are
a
third
of
a
pail
of
hot
water
containing
a
little
ammonia
or
borax
plenty
of
clean
soft
cloths
free
from
lint
a
complete
absence
of
soap
and
a
decided
presence
of
energy
aye
there
the
rub
the
less
water
used
the
better
instead
of
allowing
it
to
run
down
in
tears
squeeze
the
cloth
out
nearly
dry
going
quickly
over
one
pane
at
a
time
following
immediately
with
a
dry
cloth
and
then
polishing
wrap
the
cleaning
cloth
around
a
skewer
and
go
into
the
corners
and
around
the
edges
of
the
glass
nothing
is
more
productive
of
distorted
vision
than
looking
through
a
glass
darkly
wherefore
for
the
sake
of
the
mental
as
well
as
the
physical
eye
see
that
phyllis
window
cleaning
is
a
success
after
the
bedrooms
are
in
order
the
halls
and
passages
on
the
same
floor
and
the
bathroom
are
swept
and
cleaned
friday
on
friday
grundy
living
rooms
and
halls
are
treated
to
their
weekly
renovation
which
is
similar
to
that
which
the
bedrooms
receive
only
there
is
more
of
it
the
preparation
of
the
for
sweeping
is
more
elaborate
containing
as
it
does
more
pieces
of
furniture
and
to
be
cared
for
all
movable
pieces
are
dusted
and
taken
from
the
room
upholstered
furniture
must
be
well
brushed
going
down
into
the
tufts
and
puffs
with
a
pointed
brush
similar
to
that
used
by
painters
and
pieces
which
are
too
large
to
move
covered
with
a
dust
sheet
a
vigorous
brushing
with
a
whisk
broom
will
be
necessary
around
the
edges
of
the
carpet
in
the
corners
and
under
the
heavy
furniture
mirrors
must
be
polished
glasses
frames
backs
and
wires
of
pictures
wiped
off
and
fancy
carving
which
the
duster
will
not
reach
cleaned
out
with
a
soft
brush
if
the
room
contains
a
marble
mantel
it
can
be
cleaned
with
sapolio
or
almost
any
good
scouring
powder
and
tiles
washed
with
soap
and
water
the
fireplace
should
be
cleaned
out
before
the
sweeping
is
done
and
the
hearth
brushed
with
a
bath
afterwards
brass
trimmings
and
utensils
in
use
about
the
grate
can
be
easily
kept
clean
by
rubbing
first
with
kerosene
and
then
with
red
pomade
but
if
neglected
and
allowed
to
become
tarnished
it
is
somewhat
of
an
undertaking
to
restore
them
to
their
pristine
brightness
in
an
extreme
case
rub
with
vinegar
and
salt
wash
off
quickly
and
follow
with
some
good
polish
results
obtained
in
this
way
are
not
lasting
and
the
vinegar
and
salt
should
be
resorted
to
only
after
other
means
have
failed
another
home
cure
for
tarnished
brass
and
other
metals
is
a
mixture
of
whiting
four
pounds
cream
of
tartar
one
quarter
pound
and
calcinated
magnesia
three
ounces
apply
with
a
damp
cloth
the
dust
will
settle
while
the
brasses
are
being
cleaned
and
then
the
carpet
or
rug
should
be
brushed
over
a
second
time
lightly
and
may
be
brightened
once
a
month
or
so
by
rubbing
a
small
space
at
a
time
with
a
stiff
scrubbing
brush
dipped
in
ammonia
water
two
tablespoons
of
ammonia
to
a
gallon
of
water
and
then
quickly
wiping
over
with
a
dry
cloth
the
chandeliers
and
gas
fixtures
should
be
wiped
with
a
cloth
wrung
from
weak
suds
the
globes
dusted
or
washed
as
required
and
a
doubled
coarse
thread
drawn
back
and
forth
through
the
gas
tips
if
gas
is
in
use
registers
should
be
wiped
out
and
dusted
every
sweeping
day
to
prevent
the
accumulation
of
dust
all
woodwork
if
painted
is
dusted
and
then
wiped
down
with
a
damp
cloth
if
hardwood
use
the
crude
oil
and
turpentine
going
into
grooves
and
corners
with
a
skewer
and
rub
hard
with
a
second
clean
flannel
hardwood
floors
receive
the
same
treatment
after
being
swept
and
it
is
a
good
plan
to
go
over
all
the
furniture
in
the
same
way
to
preserve
the
life
and
fine
finish
of
the
wood
but
it
is
imperative
that
the
wood
be
rubbed
when
the
windows
have
been
washed
furniture
replaced
and
everything
is
in
order
in
the
each
of
the
remaining
rooms
is
cleaned
in
like
manner
ending
with
the
hall
where
each
stair
is
brushed
with
a
whisk
broom
into
the
dust
pan
and
carpet
walls
ceiling
and
woodwork
attended
to
as
in
the
other
rooms
the
dusting
cloths
and
broom
bags
should
go
regularly
into
the
weekly
wash
it
is
far
better
to
do
one
room
complete
at
a
time
than
to
have
a
whole
floor
torn
up
at
once
just
because
it
is
sweeping
day
is
no
reason
for
turning
the
family
into
a
whole
flock
of
noah
doves
with
no
place
for
the
soles
of
their
feet
it
is
very
easy
to
transform
black
friday
into
good
friday
by
a
little
judicious
manipulation
of
the
household
helm
the
cleaning
in
addition
to
the
routine
work
is
about
all
friday
can
hold
without
crowding
a
few
anxious
thoughts
for
the
morrow
baking
will
provide
all
things
necessary
to
it
so
there
will
be
no
delay
about
commencing
it
for
saturday
saturday
grundy
devotes
to
providing
for
the
wants
of
the
inner
man
the
heaviest
part
of
the
day
work
is
the
preparation
of
food
for
two
or
three
days
then
the
refrigerator
must
have
its
second
cleaning
and
the
pantry
too
probably
requires
renovating
by
this
time
entries
must
be
cleaned
a
second
tour
of
inspection
of
the
cellar
made
and
the
house
put
in
trim
for
the
day
that
comes
betwixt
a
saturday
and
monday
house
cleaning
this
is
not
the
domestic
bugbear
it
used
to
be
when
one
mighty
spasm
of
cleanliness
shook
the
house
from
garret
to
cellar
and
threw
its
inmates
into
a
fever
of
discomfort
and
dismay
the
modern
season
is
one
of
indolence
and
ease
compared
with
what
it
once
was
when
not
only
the
cleaning
and
living
problem
but
the
man
problem
as
well
had
to
be
solved
when
the
master
sighed
for
a
spot
in
some
vast
wilderness
vaguely
wondering
as
he
dined
fashion
and
then
gingerly
wound
his
weary
way
through
a
labyrinth
of
furniture
boxes
and
rolls
of
carpet
to
his
humble
couch
set
up
behind
the
piano
or
in
some
other
unlikely
place
if
marriage
were
a
failure
while
contact
with
the
business
end
of
a
tack
gave
point
to
his
thoughts
no
indeed
the
spring
and
autumn
of
his
discontent
are
made
glorious
summer
now
by
the
more
civilized
system
which
beginning
at
the
attic
and
working
downward
cleans
one
room
or
perhaps
two
at
a
time
as
a
day
work
restoring
everything
to
order
before
a
new
attack
is
made
preparation
the
task
of
cleaning
a
house
in
which
the
regular
work
is
systematically
carried
on
is
not
so
very
arduous
and
follows
the
general
plan
of
the
weekly
cleaning
before
the
real
work
begins
have
a
general
overhauling
and
weeding
out
of
cubbies
boxes
and
trunks
scrub
out
drawers
and
reline
with
clean
paper
and
clean
clothespresses
wardrobes
and
closets
in
the
spring
there
will
be
furs
and
flannels
to
shake
brush
and
put
away
and
in
the
fall
summer
clothing
before
the
spring
cleaning
the
stoves
must
be
taken
down
and
cleaned
out
stovepipes
cleaned
and
rubbed
with
boiled
oil
to
prevent
rust
and
both
put
away
in
the
attic
chimneys
too
must
be
cleaned
and
if
the
heating
is
by
furnace
it
should
be
put
in
order
and
all
its
parts
swept
free
from
soot
covering
the
registers
during
the
operation
this
is
better
done
in
the
spring
so
the
summer
winds
can
not
scatter
the
dust
and
soot
through
the
house
the
supply
of
coal
and
wood
for
the
ensuing
year
should
be
put
into
the
cellar
and
then
the
preliminaries
are
over
the
fall
cleaning
must
be
delayed
until
the
canning
and
pickling
are
all
done
and
the
busy
curious
thirsty
fly
is
pretty
well
extinct
now
is
the
best
time
for
painting
whitewashing
papering
and
other
decorating
and
repairing
if
done
in
the
spring
its
freshness
is
bound
to
be
more
or
less
spoiled
by
insects
during
the
summer
be
as
careful
as
one
may
cleaning
draperies
rugs
carpets
the
first
step
in
the
real
cleaning
is
to
take
down
draperies
shake
well
hang
out
on
the
line
right
side
under
and

hired
help
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
the
subject
of
hired
help
is
about
as
great
as
the
dealing
with
the
help
herself
who
is
so
often
not
a
help
at
all
the
appellation
is
the
one
insisted
upon
by
the
great
unorganized
union
of
the
household
tramp
whose
pride
can
not
endure
the
stigma
implied
in
the
name
servant
and
who
has
never
learned
that
we
in
all
walks
of
life
are
more
or
less
servants
servants
of
fame
or
ambition
or
duty
or
country
or
business
the
maid
who
gave
notice
on
the
spot
because
she
was
introduced
by
the
daughter
of
the
house
to
her
mother
as
your
new
servant
seems
to
be
the
incarnation
of
that
spirit
of
independence
which
is
loosening
the
very
foundations
of
our
national
structure
england
has
servants
germany
has
servants
but
america
has
help
let
us
then
like
agag
of
old
walk
delicately
remembering
that
help
by
any
other
name
is
even
more
surrounded
by
thorns
the
general
housemaid
it
is
almost
impossible
to
get
a
competent
girl
for
general
housework
these
days
and
viewed
in
the
light
of
past
experiences
with
the
able
but
unwilling
the
willing
but
unable
the
stupid
the
dishonest
the
ignorant
servant
within
our
gates
with
the
very
occasional
good
genius
of
the
kitchen
to
leaven
the
lump
of
incompetency
we
are
sorely
tempted
to
give
up
the
struggle
and
do
our
own
work
feeling
that
the
time
and
strength
so
consumed
are
more
than
compensated
for
by
the
peace
of
mind
which
comes
with
the
cessation
of
hostilities
but
after
a
breathing
spell
we
are
generally
ready
for
another
joust
and
the
struggle
goes
on
as
of
yore
shops
and
factories
have
greatly
reduced
the
supply
of
servants
and
of
these
so
many
specialize
as
cooks
waitresses
and
nurses
that
we
really
have
a
very
small
choice
when
seeking
an
maid
one
who
has
some
knowledge
and
experience
of
the
different
branches
of
housecraft
and
right
here
we
encounter
another
difficulty
ways
of
living
and
methods
of
household
management
are
so
diverse
that
a
girl
might
be
considered
competent
by
one
mistress
and
entirely
the
reverse
by
another
our
servants
are
more
or
less
as
we
make
them
and
it
is
frequently
the
case
that
the
mistress
herself
needs
a
course
of
instruction
before
she
is
capable
of
rightly
instructing
her
maid
a
course
which
shall
embrace
not
only
housewifery
but
the
cultivation
of
patience
wisdom
consideration
and
that
power
which
comes
only
with
knowledge
the
raw
foreigner
with
whom
she
often
has
to
deal
is
so
entirely
ignorant
of
life
as
we
know
it
her
training
in
field
and
peasant
cottage
has
in
no
way
prepared
her
for
the
refined
home
with
its
dainty
furnishings
and
food
and
the
difficulty
of
understanding
and
being
understood
adds
to
the
perplexities
of
the
slow
and
undeveloped
mind
such
a
servant
is
really
nothing
but
a
child
so
far
as
her
faculties
are
concerned
and
should
be
treated
as
one
until
experience
and
training
shall
enable
her
to
put
away
childish
things
like
most
children
she
is
an
imitator
let
it
be
our
care
that
we
set
only
a
worthy
example
before
her
she
is
quick
to
recognize
inconsistency
or
unfairness
and
to
seize
an
opportunity
to
get
the
upper
hand
try
to
treat
her
with
a
firmness
which
is
not
arbitrary
and
a
kindness
and
consideration
which
are
not
familiarity
make
her
feel
that
she
is
an
entity
a
person
of
place
and
importance
in
making
home
comfort
and
a
good
bit
of
that
subtle
antagonism
which
seems
to
exist
between
mistress
and
maid
will
be
gradually
smoothed
away
do
wonder
if
she
has
the
blues
occasionally
you
have
them
yourself
do
be
worried
if
she
is
a
trifle
slow
help
her
to
systematize
and
so
shorten
her
labors
if
she
cracks
and
breaks
your
dishes
show
her
how
to
handle
and
care
for
them
with
a
timely
word
about
avoiding
undue
haste
if
she
wants
to
do
certain
things
in
her
own
way
let
her
provided
it
is
not
a
bad
way
until
you
can
prove
to
her
that
yours
is
better
you
know
there
are
other
ways
than
yours
good
ones
too
study
her
as
you
would
a
refractory
engine
if
she
runs
off
the
track
or
does
run
at
all
or
has
a
hotbox
or
any
other
creature
failing
learn
the
cause
and
remedy
it
if
you
can
she
is
human
like
yourself
and
young
too
probably
and
needs
diversion
do
begrudge
it
to
her
when
it
is
of
the
right
kind
like
you
she
needs
rest
occasionally
between
whiles
make
an
opportunity
for
it
she
needs
good
strengthening
food
see
that
she
has
it
and
if
she
prefers
plain
living
and
high
thinking
on
bread
and
tea
that
her
own
lookout
she
probably
will
have
strong
leanings
toward
the
jam
closet
lock
the
door
and
keep
the
key
and
leave
no
money
jewelry
or
other
valuables
carelessly
about
to
tempt
her
perhaps
beyond
her
strength
do
be
overnice
in
your
exactions
if
she
is
even
a
fairly
good
cook
waitress
and
laundress
you
are
indeed
blessed
among
women
give
judicious
praise
or
kindly
criticism
where
due
sometimes
a
warning
in
time
will
save
nine
blunders
while
she
is
under
your
roof
and
a
member
of
your
family
you
are
in
a
measure
responsible
for
her
welfare
moral
spiritual
and
physical
and
are
her
natural
and
lawful
protector
she
may
neither
need
nor
want
your
protection
but
let
her
feel
that
it
is
there
none
the
less
how
to
select
a
maid
and
now
how
shall
we
find
this
person
to
assist
us
in
making
domestic
life
one
grand
sweet
song
we
hope
the
usual
way
is
to
apply
to
a
reputable
agency
where
you
will
find
the
better
class
of
girls
and
be
dealt
with
honestly
an
agency
of
this
kind
usually
keeps
on
file
the
references
of
girls
offering
themselves
for
service
which
will
give
you
at
least
some
idea
of
the
qualifications
of
the
maid
you
may
engage
many
housekeepers
advertise
in
the
daily
papers
or
trades
journals
the
advertisement
being
a
concise
statement
of
the
location
whether
city
or
country
the
kind
of
service
expected
and
the
wages
paid
a
third
and
usually
most
satisfactory
way
of
obtaining
help
is
through
some
friend
who
can
back
her
recommendation
with
a
guarantee
having
entered
your
application
decide
upon
your
plan
of
action
in
the
interview
which
will
take
place
when
dame
maid
presents
herself
for
the
mutual
inspection
mutual
because
though
is
not
hers
to
reason
why
she
has
a
perfect
right
to
know
what
awaits
her
this
is
somewhat
of
an
ordeal
especially
to
the
novice
in
the
business
it
is
essential
for
the
housekeeper
to
know
just
what
questions
to
put
to
the
applicant
what
questions
to
look
for
in
return
what
to
tell
her
of
the
household
regime
and
of
her
individual
part
in
it
in
short
she
must
know
her
ground
and
then
stand
on
it
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
with
decision
and
dignity
the
applicant
personal
appearance
tells
something
of
what
she
is
if
slovenly
her
work
would
be
ditto
if
flashy
with
cheap
finery
and
well
she
may
be
honest
and
reliable
but
she
may
also
make
it
difficult
for
you
to
be
mistress
in
your
own
house
be
a
little
wary
of
the
servant
if
she
is
really
desirable
she
is
not
apt
to
be
casting
about
for
a
position
and
besides
she
is
usually
sot
in
her
ways
the
fact
of
a
girl
looking
sullen
or
morose
should
not
militate
against
her
she
may
be
only
shy
or
embarrassed
if
she
is
impertinent
maybe
her
former
mistress
talked
back
or
made
too
great
an
equal
of
her
anyway
be
your
own
ladylike
self
and
she
will
probably
fall
in
line
the
quiet
girl
who
evinces
a
willingness
to
learn
is
apt
to
be
a
safe
investment
questions
and
answers
question
her
about
her
housework
experience
her
ability
to
do
plain
cooking
and
baking
make
beds
serve
wash
and
iron
she
can
not
possibly
be
an
expert
along
each
of
these
lines
perhaps
not
on
one
even
but
a
general
working
knowledge
of
all
is
very
desirable
have
a
complete
understanding
with
her
at
the
outset
regarding
her
work
wages
hours
of
work
and
of
leisure
and
breakages
do
try
to
put
the
best
foot
forward
though
there
is
no
particular
harm
in
pointing
out
the
special
advantages
she
would
enjoy
in
your
home
but
give
her
a
frank
and
honest
statement
of
what
she
may
expect
if
she
asks
you
as
she
no
doubt
will
if
you
have
much
company
say
so
if
you
have
but
add
that
you
will
relieve
her
as
much
as
you
can
of
the
extra
work
entailed
and
do
resent
her
asking
about
the
size
of
your
family
and
about
her
room
for
she
would
naturally
be
interested
in
both
a
complete
understanding
at
every
point
may
save
considerable
future
trouble
the
question
of
a
uniform
may
come
up
during
your
talk
some
girls
absolutely
refuse
to
don
anything
which
looks
to
them
like
a
badge
of
servitude
if
this
happens
let
it
go
because
you
know
it
is
not
an
absolute
essential
at
the
close
of
the
conference
ask
for
references
no
mistress
is
obliged
to
give
a
reference
to
her
departing
servant
but
if
she
does
so
it
ought
in
all
conscience
to
be
an
honest
one
it
is
a
deplorable
fact
that
many
housekeepers
either
in
a
desire
to
be
magnanimous
or
to
avoid
a
scene
or
annoyance
give
utterly
undeserved
recommendations
thus
opening
the
way
for
other
reigns
of
terror
which
a
little
personal
application
of
could
have
prevented
investigate
these
references
either
in
person
or
by
letter
otherwise
you
may
discover
later
on
that
they
were
forged
by
the
girl
herself
or
by
some
of
her
accommodating
friends
agreements
the
term
of
service
is
determined
by
an
agreement
between
mistress
and
maid
the
usual
custom
is
to
take
the
applicant
for
a
week
trial
if
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
both
are
satisfied
the
arrangement
continues
from
week
to
week
if
the
payments
are
weekly
in
households
in
which
monthly
payments
are
preferred
the
maid
is
hired
by
the
month
the
agreement
entered
into
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
legal
contract
and
not
to
be
lightly
violated
when
serving
by
the
week
the
maid
is
entitled
to
and
must
also
give
three
days
notice
when
by
the
month
a
week
notice
is
required
or
if
for
any
reason
her
mistress
wishes
her
to
leave
at
once
she
may
pay
her
one
week
wages
if
the
maid
leaves
suddenly
and
without
giving
notice
in
the
middle
of
her
term
she
forfeits
all
claim
to
wages
which
have
accrued
since
her
last
payment
if
discharged
unjustly
and
without
sufficient
cause
before
the
expiration
of
her
term
she
is
entitled
to
her
wages
in
full
but
if
discharged
without
notice
because
of
intoxication
immorality
dishonesty
arrant
disobedience
or
permanent
incapacity
from
illness
she
can
claim
nothing
it
is
customary
with
some
housekeepers
to
start
the
new
maid
on
a
comparatively
low
salary
with
the
promise
of
an
increase
of
perhaps
fifty
cents
per
month
in
case
she
proves
herself
worthy
till
the
maximum
is
reached
this
is
often
an
incentive
to
good
service
the
maid
leisure
time
her
times
of
leisure
vary
somewhat
according
to
circumstances

and
evening
and
sunday
afternoon
and
evening
of
each
week
are
usually
allowed
her
though
she
may
be
given
only
every
other
sunday
if
an
extra
evening
can
be
given
her
all
well
and
good
the
maid
should
be
able
to
count
on
getting
away
at
a
certain
hour
so
she
can
arrange
to
meet
her
friends
and
she
must
also
understand
that
ten
is
to
see
her
in
the
house
that
hour
being
as
late
as
any
girl
ought
to
be
out
in
homes
which
employ
two
maids
equal
privileges
are
granted
each
one
assuming
the
work
of
the
other
during
her
absence
it
is
a
simple
matter
to
arrange
for
light
meals
on
the
cook
day
out
and
to
minimize
the
serving
when
the
waitress
is
to
be
away
when
night
dinner
is
the
custom
and
but
one
maid
employed
she
either
goes
from
ten
until
four
leaving
her
mistress
to
prepare
luncheon
or
else
if
she
is
away
over
the
dinner
hour
the
meals
are
shifted
with
dinner
at
noon
and
tea
at
night
she
leaves
on
sunday
immediately
after
the
dinner
work
is
done
and
does
not
return
to
prepare
tea
if
she
prefers
to
spend
her
leisure
time
quietly
at
home
reading
or
sewing
she
should
be
encouraged
to
do
so
and
not
be
forced
to
go
out
in
to
escape
calls
for
extra
work
at
that
time
the
mistress
has
no
claim
on
her
maid
off
hours
dress
and
personal
neatness
the
maid
uniform
consists
of
three
print
gowns
with
a
gingham
apron
for
morning
wear
and
for
afternoons
a
white
apron
with
white
collar
or
kerchief
and
cuffs
cap
or
whatever
additional
touches
her
mistress
may
prefer
the
maid
usually
buys
her
own
gowns
while
her
mistress
provides
the
accessories
which
remain
her
property
when
the
maid
leaves
the
afternoon
dress
of
one
week
becomes
the
morning
dress
of
the
following
black
is
frequently
adopted
for
afternoon
wear
but
whatever
the
dress
insist
upon
its
being
washable
woolens
absorb
odors
and
perspiration
and
in
time
make
not
only
her
person
but
her
room
offensive
issue
an
edict
against
frowzy
pompadours
and
frizzes
pointing
out
the
necessity
for
having
smooth
neat
hair
particularly
in
the
kitchen
require
her
to
bathe
regularly
the
question
of
allowing
the
maid
to
use
the
bathroom
must
be
settled
individually
if
she
is
careful
about
cleaning
the
tub
and
leaving
things
in
good
order
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
why
she
who
so
needs
them
should
be
deprived
of
advantages
for
cleanliness
which
the
rest
of
us
enjoy
standing
on
one
foot
in
a
slippery
washbowl
footbath
or
even
larger
tub
is
a
poor
substitute
instruct
her
about
arranging
her
clothing
at
night
so
it
will
air
you
may
even
find
if
she
is
a
foreigner
that
you
will
have
to
introduce
her
to
the
nightdress
such
things
have
happened
explaining
to
her
the
undesirability
of
sleeping
in
underclothing
which
she
has
worn
all
day
carelessness
if
a
girl
is
habitually
careless
about
handling
the
dishes
and
breaks
nicks
and
cracks
result
hold
her
responsible
and
deduct
from
her
wages
what
you
consider
a
fair
equivalent
for
the
loss
such
a
course
is
astonishingly
curative
sometimes
the
painstaking
careful
girl
seldom
injures
anything
and
the
occasional
accident
may
be
overlooked
before
your
new
maid
arrives
write
out
an
itemized
list
of
all
crockery
silver
glass
and
table
linen
which
are
to
be
in
constant
use
designating
those
which
are
defaced
in
any
way
and
go
over
it
with
her
every
week
holding
her
responsible
for
any
damaged
or
missing
articles
the
maid
room
remove
from
the
servant
room
all
traces
of
its
last
occupant
and
put
it
in
order
for
the
new
maid
with
the
bed
freshly
made
up
with
clean
blankets

and
spread
the
room
should
be
comfortably
furnished
with

with

impart
a
certain
air
of
dainty
hominess
a
cheap
set
of
hanging

for

would
be
a
welcome
addition

should
be

the

the
look
of

and
remember
that

of

poorly
ventilated

in
summer
cold
in

and
unattractive
to
a
degree
it
ought
to
bring
a
blush
of
shame
above
all
see
that
the
bed
is
comfortable
for
who
can
blame
a
tired
girl
for
getting
out
on
the
wrong
side
of
a
bed
so
hard
and
lumpy
that
it
surely
must
rise
and
smite
her
place
on

of

one
prefers
the
inexpensive
colored
blankets
and
a
honeycomb
spread
one
feather
pillow
of
average
size
will
be
sufficient
when
two
servants
occupy

there

a
temporary

an

carries
with
it
a
subtle
and
refining
influence
how
to
train
a
maid
set
thine
house
in
order
and
have
everything
pantry
and
kitchen
in
particular
as
you
expect
your
maid
to
keep
it
first
impressions
are
truly
the
most
lasting
and
if
she
comes
into
a
littered
soiled
untidy
kingdom
you
may
expect
her
reign
to
be
proportionally
lax
and
her
respect
for
your
housekeeping
abilities
conspicuously
absent
this
is
a
bad
beginning
and
then
it
is
not
exactly
fair
to
set
her
to
work
the
very
first
thing
to
bring
order
from
chaos
see
that
she
has
all
the
tools
necessary
to
her
work
replacing
broken
or
useless
utensils
and
assuring
yourself
that
the
cutlery
and
crockery
for
her
individual
table
use
are
whole
and
inviting
show
the
maid
to
her
room
as
soon
as
she
arrives
with
instructions
to
don
her
working
garb
and
then
begins
the
induction
into
office
a
trying
experience
to
you
both
and
one
which
should
be
sufficiently
prolonged
to
enable
her
to
get
a
good
grip
of
each
new
duty
as
it
presents
itself
avoid
confusing
her
at
the
start
with
a
jumble
of
instructions
but
make
haste
slowly
giving
directions
in
a
way
which
she
can
understand
introduce
her
into
her
workroom
explain
the
range
and
show
her
how
to
operate
it
point
out
the
different
utensils
and
their
uses
and
where
foods
are
kept
if
she
comes
in
the
morning
her
first
duty
will
be
the
preparation
of
luncheon
give
her
instructions
for
that
meal
what
to
have
and
how
to
set
the
table
this
being
the
proper
time
to
go
over
the
list
of
table
furnishings
with
her
do
embarrass
her
by
being
continually
at
her
heels
but
give
what
directions
you
think
necessary
and
then
let
her
apply
her
judgment
and
previous
experience
to
carrying
them
out
if
you
find
that
she
has
neither
do
be
discouraged
for
you
may
be
entertaining
an
angel
unawares
but
adopt
the
line
upon
line
precept
upon
precept
plan
and
the
situation
will
slowly
but
surely
brighten
if
she
is
overstupid
in
one
direction
she
may
be
bright
enough
in
some
other
to
establish
a
balance
luncheon
and
its
dishes
disposed
of
arrange
with
her
about
dinner
and
after
its
completion
speak
about
her
hour
of
rising
the
preparation
of
breakfast
etc
and
the
morning
and
the
evening
were
the
first
day
the
daily
routine
the
day
routine
of
work
varies
in
different
households
and
makes
it
impossible
for
one
to
offer
an
infallible
system
the
keeping
of
but
one
servant
does
not
admit
of
an
elaborate
mode
of
living
and
on
the
days
on
which
the
heaviest
work
washing
and
ironing
falls
madam
would
do
well
to
assume
considerable
of
the
regular
work
herself
the
care
of
bedrooms
dusting
and
putting
to
rights
of
living
and
dining
rooms
preparation
of
lunch
and
whatever
else
seems
best
all
of
the
hardest
work
should
be
done
in
the
morning
before
the
first
freshness
of
maid
and
day
is
worn
away
after
you
have
established
a
satisfactory
schedule
abide
by
it
and
oblige
your
maid
to
do
the
same
it
soon
becomes
automatic
and
is
therefore
accomplished
with
less
exhaustion
of
mind
and
body
the
regular
day
work
is
about
as
follows
the
maid
rises
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
a
half
before
the
breakfast
hour
throws
open
her
bed
and
window
and
goes
to
the
kitchen
where
she
starts
the
fire
if
a
coal
range
is
used
fills
and
puts
on
the
teakettle
and
puts
the
cereal
on
to
cook
then
she
airs
out
dining
and
living
rooms
and
hall
brushes
up
any
litter
wipes
off
bare
floors
dusts
closes
windows
opens
furnace
drafts
or
looks
after
stoves
and
leaving
tidiness
in
her
wake
sets
the
table
and
completes
the
preparations
for
breakfast
the
amount
of
work
she
can
accomplish
before
it
is
served
depends
upon
herself
and
upon
how
elaborate
the
meal
may
be
after
the
main
part
of
the
breakfast
has
been
served
she
may
be
excused
from
the
dining
room
and
takes
this
time
to
open
bedroom
windows
and
empty
slops
after
which
she
has
her
own
breakfast
when
the
breakfast
table
has
been
cleared
the
dining
room
set
to
rights
food
taken
care
of
and
utensils
put
to
soak
the
mistress
inspects
pantry
and
refrigerator
offers
suggestions
for
the
disposal
of
arranges
with
the
maid
for
the
day
meals
and
makes
out
the
list
for
grocer
and
butcher
adding
whatever
she
thinks
best
to
the
list
of
needed
staples
already
prepared
by
the
maid
tea
sugar
soap
etc
never
leave
the
entire
ordering
of
supplies
to
the
maid
her
part
being
simply
to
jot
down
on
a
pad
hung
in
the
kitchen
for
that
purpose
a
memorandum
of
such
things
as
need
replenishing
when
the
conference
is
ended
the
maid
washes
the
dishes
puts
kitchen
and
pantry
in
order
fills
and
cleans
lamps
prepares
dishes
which
require
slow
cooking
makes
the
beds
unless
her
mistress
prefers
to
do
this
herself
and
tidies
up
and
bathrooms
if
the
living
rooms
were
not
dusted
before
breakfast
she
attends
to
it
now
perhaps
sweeping
front
porch
and
steps
and
is
then
ready
for
the
extra
work
of
the
day
the
cleaning
of
silver
washing
of
windows
etc
when
the
work
is
disposed
of
she
will
probably
have
an
hour
or
two
to
herself
before
it
is
time
to
begin
preparations
for
dinner
she
should
not
be
interrupted
in
her
work
for
this
that
or
the
other
but
allowed
to
go
on
with
it
according
to
schedule
she
usually
attends
the
door
except
on
wash
day
or
during
extra
stress
of
work
she
will
perhaps
object
to
doing
so
when
her
mistress
is
at
home
and
may
need
instruction
about
slipping
on
a
clean
white
apron
greeting
a
caller
with
civility
presenting
a
small
tray
for
her
card
etc
initiating
her
into
the
mysteries
of
setting
and
serving
the
table
may
be
a
long
operation
for
the
good
waitress
is
usually
born
not
made
but
do
be
too
exacting
remember
that
she
is
not
a
specialist
and
arrange
the
flowers
and
add
other
nice
touches
yourself
and
dispense
with
elaborateness
of
serving
teach
her
to
economize
time
by
washing
dishes
between
courses
when
her
presence
is
not
required
in
the
dining
room
and
insist
upon
having
meals
served
at
stated
hours
being
careful
that
your
family
respond
to
the
summons
to
the
table
with
corresponding
punctuality
duties
of
cook
and
nurse
each
additional
servant
complicates
the
planning
of
the
work
when
there
are
two
they
are
usually
cook
and
waitress
the
former
having
entire
charge
of
her
own
special
domain
the
kitchen
with
all
that
pertains
to
it
except
perhaps
the
preparation
of
salads
and
the
washing
of
glass
silver
and
fine
dishes
she
does
the
heavier
part
of
the
laundry
work
and
some
part
of
the
sweeping
washes
windows
takes
charge
of
cellar
and
pantry
or
does
such
other
work
as
her
mistress
designates
each
duty
being
plainly
specified
at
the
time
she
is
hired
the
tasks
of
the
waitress
are
more
varied
the
airing
brushing
up
and
dusting
of
the
living
rooms
falls
to
her
share
with
the
entire
charge
of
the
dining
room
serving
the
table
and
washing
the
dishes
glass
and
silver
she
also
has
charge
of
the
bedrooms
a
part
of
her
duties
in
that
connection
being
to
prepare
them
for
the
night
removing
spreads
and
shams
turning
down
covers
closing
blinds
and
carrying
to
each
room
iced
water
the
last
thing
before
retiring
and
hot
water
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
she
attends
the
door
cleans
silver
wipes
off
woodwork
and
even
helps
with
the
mending
when
the
family
is
small
she
usually
does
her
own
washing
and
assists
with
the
ironing
if
her
mistress
so
decree
the
division
of
labor
between
cook
and
waitress
is
sometimes
a
delicate
matter
and
here
more
than
ever
is
adherence
to
rule
and
routine
imperative
the
tendency
for
one
servant
to
override
the
other
and
more
yielding
must
be
guarded
against
when
a
nurse
is
to
be
hired
she
should
be
questioned
as
to
her
experience
in
caring
for
children
and
her
cleanliness
honesty
truthfulness
morals
and
general
character
carefully
investigated
she
ought
to
be
fond
of
children
and
enough
to
enter
into
their
little
games
and
joys
and
sorrows
no
maid
whose
example
is
demoralizing
to
the
little
ones
should
have
any
place
in
the
home
the
nurse
probably
will
do
the
baby
washing
and
may
help
a
little
here
and
there
about
the
house
but
as
a
rule
she
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
general
work
servant
company
the
vexed
question
of
the
lady
help
gentleman
company
usually
has
to
be
faced
by
the
housekeeper
since
yours
is
your
maid
only
home
it
is
better
to
allow
her
to
receive
her
friends
there
than
for
her
to
seek
them
elsewhere
taking
it
for
granted
of
course
that
any
girl
whom
you
would
be
willing
to
have
in
your
family
would
have
no
objectionable
friends
and
besides
she
is
somebody
daughter
you
know
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
time
will
come
when
every
maid
can
be
provided
with
a
sitting
room
of
her
own
but
until
then
her
friends
will
have
to
be
received
in
your
kitchen
let
her
feel
that
they
are
welcome
out
of
working
hours
a
servant
of
the
right
kind
will
appreciate
and
not
abuse
this
privilege
and
so
on
and
so
on
after
all
is
said
and
done
one
can
only
give
a
few
hints
and
suggestions
on
the
servant
question
with
the
wistful
hope
that
they
may
help
some
one
to
start
right
for
maids
may
come
and
maids
may
go
but
the
problem
goes
marching
on
the
only
way
to
do
when
it
overtakes
one
is
to
grapple
with
it
womanfully
for
it
happen
even
in
the
best
regulated
families
the
end
